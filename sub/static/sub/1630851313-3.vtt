08:32.045 --> 08:35.088
Elaine wants me to wait here.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.999
And hopefully Jeffery

and he'll call again.

08:41.413 --> 08:42.746

08:42.839 --> 08:44.097
It's all we got.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.024
How about I radio the station
and let 'em know

08:46.251 --> 08:47.751
-I'm not coming in tonight?
-No.

08:47.844 --> 08:49.194
Go back to work.

08:49.345 --> 08:51.696
I mean, this city can use
all the heroes

08:51.848 --> 08:53.940

08:54.034 --> 08:56.743
Okay. I'm a phone call away.

08:57.854 --> 08:59.429
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.689
-Hey, Bobby.
Can you do me a favor?
-Yeah.

09:01.783 --> 09:04.284
Can you drop off David
at my place on your way?

09:04.378 --> 09:06.027
Sure.

09:06.046 --> 09:10.048
-Hey, I am so sorry
this has happened.
-Yeah.

09:10.199 --> 09:12.968
Yeah, me, too.

09:23.046 --> 09:25.397
Okay...

09:25.548 --> 09:26.731
what's the plan?

09:26.883 --> 09:28.975
-I just told you the plan.
-Athena,

09:29.127 --> 09:32.386
now I was married to you
for 17 years.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.740
And there is no way in hell
that you are gonna sit here

09:35.892 --> 09:37.242
and wait for that phone to ring.

09:37.393 --> 09:40.987
So whatever the next step is,
I'm taking it with you.

09:41.139 --> 09:43.489
This is our son. And damn it,

09:43.584 --> 09:46.751
you are not leaving me
behind this time.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.757
All right.

09:52.909 --> 09:54.167
So what are you thinking?

09:54.319 --> 09:58.412
Well, we know he's using
Ransone's car, his gun,

09:58.506 --> 09:59.672
and his badge.

09:59.825 --> 10:03.676
So it makes me wonder
what else of Ransone's

10:03.829 --> 10:06.104
has he been using?

10:23.698 --> 10:25.457
(brakes screech)

10:25.608 --> 10:27.208
(door opens, closes)

10:58.325 --> 10:59.991
Damn it.

11:02.570 --> 11:04.913
Okay, Harry...

11:06.166 --> 11:10.076
Come on now, buddy.
You don't want to do this.

11:10.228 --> 11:12.962
You know I can't leave you
out here alone.

11:14.582 --> 11:17.233
It's just not safe.

11:17.326 --> 11:20.253
I'm not fooling around, kid.

11:20.405 --> 11:22.071
I don't have time for this.

I'm gonna give you
to the count of five

11:23.684 --> 11:24.999
to show yourself.

11:25.093 --> 11:27.519
Then I'm gonna go back
and put a bullet

11:27.746 --> 11:30.063
in everyone you love.

11:32.934 --> 11:34.675
One.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.653
Two.

11:38.757 --> 11:40.699
Three!
Knock it off.

11:40.850 --> 11:41.941
-Help!
-Get in the car.

11:42.093 --> 11:43.259
-Just get in the car.
-Help!

11:43.278 --> 11:44.369
Hey, what are you doing?

11:44.520 --> 11:46.763
It's okay, ma'am,
I'm a police officer.

11:46.856 --> 11:48.206
This kid's in my custody.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.024
-Caught him breaking
into the building.
-He's lying!

11:50.043 --> 11:51.710
Taking advantage
of the blackout, no doubt.

11:51.861 --> 11:53.878
-Help, please. He's gonna
kill me. He's not a cop.
-Hey, hey!

11:54.030 --> 11:55.788
-Stop resisting.
-Please.

11:55.941 --> 11:57.215
If you have a phone, record us.

11:57.366 --> 12:00.534
My parents need to know
what happened to me.

12:00.628 --> 12:01.886
You said you're a cop.

12:02.038 --> 12:03.796
Where's your badge?
Show it to me.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.265
You can't be serious.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.544
You want to see my badge?

12:10.564 --> 12:13.306
Here it is? See?

12:13.458 --> 12:15.316
Okay? I told you, I'm a cop.

12:16.811 --> 12:19.654
It's nothing to worry about,
okay?

12:21.649 --> 12:24.451
You and your pooch have
a great night, okay?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.408
<i> DISPATCHER:</i>
<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

12:41.428 --> 12:42.986
<i> CALLER: My friend got shot.</i>
<i> We're in the PPZ.</i>

12:43.079 --> 12:44.320
<i> -The what?</i>
<i> -The Autonomous Cop-Free Zone.</i>

12:44.413 --> 12:45.838
<i> On Santa Monica and Vermont.</i>

12:46.767 --> 12:49.175
Dispatch says there's
a Gold Line Metro station

12:49.269 --> 12:51.010
in the middle of this thing.

12:51.162 --> 12:53.438
-Can't we use that to sneak in?
-I don't sneak.

12:53.665 --> 12:55.014
WOMAN:
I don't know who
called you guys.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.942
No official passes
these barricades.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.836
-We don't need you!
-MAN: Get out of here!

12:59.929 --> 13:02.188
-We have volunteers
to take care of that.
-But they're not.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.098
Someone in your camp called 911.

13:04.192 --> 13:06.509
-That's who we are. We are 911.
-(siren wails)

13:06.528 --> 13:08.177
You've got a man in there
bleeding out.

13:08.196 --> 13:10.530
You have your rules,
and we have ours.

13:10.682 --> 13:12.515
-Why is everyone just
standing there?
-BUCK: They won't let us in.

13:12.608 --> 13:14.292
This wannabe mayor is
blocking the way

13:14.443 --> 13:17.128
-'cause of some stupid rule.
-MAN: Get the hell out of here!

13:17.355 --> 13:19.297
Really? Since when
do anarchists have rules?

13:19.524 --> 13:21.282
-WOMAN: Get out!
-Adapt or die.

13:21.376 --> 13:23.026
There's no rules here.

13:23.119 --> 13:26.045
MAN:
What are you doing?

13:26.197 --> 13:27.213
(excited chatter)

13:27.307 --> 13:29.123
You're not supposed to be here.

13:29.217 --> 13:30.624
I'm not supposed to crack
your skull open

13:30.644 --> 13:32.143
with this either.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.354
Where is the injured guy?

13:36.299 --> 13:40.693
-Help. Over here!
-All right, clear a path.

13:43.731 --> 13:46.473
Gunshot wound. Looks like
a through-and-through.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.827
Brachial artery looks
to be intact. Chim?

13:48.978 --> 13:51.996
-Got it.
-All right, I'll call it in.

13:54.317 --> 13:56.084
Take some breaths.

14:00.823 --> 14:02.757
(groaning)

14:04.177 --> 14:06.994
BUCK:
So, that was awesome, Cap.

14:07.088 --> 14:10.056
Just not having it tonight, huh?

14:11.167 --> 14:13.017
Everything okay?

14:14.262 --> 14:16.688
Harry's been kidnapped.

14:27.350 --> 14:30.960
-What's the paint for?
-Never mind.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.354
You can't get away, you know.

14:33.448 --> 14:34.614
I know.

14:34.766 --> 14:37.524
Mean old Mommy's gonna
come after me, right?

14:37.619 --> 14:39.860
No, actually I was thinking
about my dad.

14:39.954 --> 14:41.713
He's gonna beat your ass.

14:41.864 --> 14:43.214
Enough of this crap.

14:46.794 --> 14:48.702
Hands.

14:48.796 --> 14:51.347
Hands, damn it!

14:53.727 --> 14:55.351
(muffled cry)

14:58.214 --> 15:00.398
So our boy was really
charging neighbors

15:00.625 --> 15:01.958
five dollars a head?

15:01.976 --> 15:03.717
I hope you told him
to give it back.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.461
Yes.

15:05.554 --> 15:06.812
It was enterprising.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.390
God, what if we don't find him?

15:09.484 --> 15:13.060
What if we get to Lou's
apartment and there's nothing?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.804
We don't know what
we're gonna find, Michael.

15:14.897 --> 15:17.081
-You told Maynard that we're not
waiting for them, right?
-Yeah.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.918
She said she'd send
whoever she could, but no,

15:20.145 --> 15:22.236
I'm not waiting for backup.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.421
I just don't understand it.

15:23.648 --> 15:26.090
I mean, why does this guy
hate you so much?

15:26.242 --> 15:28.409
I mean, he could really be
in Mexico right now.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.762
Why is he still
coming after you?

15:30.989 --> 15:32.413
I shot off his junk.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.824
I'm sorry, you did what, now?

15:34.842 --> 15:38.269
His magic wand. I shot it off.

15:38.421 --> 15:41.514
-No, you did not.
-I did.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.983
(laughing)

15:45.687 --> 15:48.613
-Well, that would do it. Okay.
-It's not funny, Michael.

15:48.764 --> 15:50.006
The hell it's not. I mean,

15:50.099 --> 15:51.841
considering what you
arrested him for?

15:51.859 --> 15:53.676
I mean, it's poetic.

15:53.695 --> 15:56.012
He was using it as a weapon.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.697
You disarmed the man.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.625
"Hands in the air! Drop it!"

16:00.776 --> 16:02.609
(both laugh)

16:02.629 --> 16:03.944
I didn't do it on purpose.

16:04.038 --> 16:07.540
But I will say I am not sorry.

16:07.692 --> 16:10.209
All right, we're here.

16:10.361 --> 16:12.453
All right, I guess, uh,
this is the part

16:12.472 --> 16:14.455
where you tell me that
you're the cop,

16:14.474 --> 16:17.258
and I'm the architect, and I
can't come in there with you.

16:17.368 --> 16:20.645
I wouldn't dare. But I go first.

16:20.796 --> 16:22.730
All right.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.193
Clear.

16:35.403 --> 16:36.736
Bedroom clear.

16:36.888 --> 16:39.330
Is anyone even staying here?

16:40.667 --> 16:41.907
Oh, yeah.

16:42.060 --> 16:45.819
He was here, and he wants me
to know it.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.171
Is that a message?

16:47.398 --> 16:49.749
If the middle finger's
a message, oh, yeah.

16:49.901 --> 16:50.991
It's a message.

16:51.085 --> 16:52.902
Okay, well,
then what else is here?

16:52.920 --> 16:56.830
You know, maybe that's not
the only message he left behind.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.016
Maybe there's something else.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.183
You know, a clue to where
he took Harry.

16:59.410 --> 17:00.576
Michael, don't touch anything!

17:00.669 --> 17:01.927
What?!

17:02.080 --> 17:03.246
This is a crime scene.

17:03.339 --> 17:04.597
We gotta let 'em go over it.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.190
-We said we wouldn't wait
for them.
-We didn't.

17:06.342 --> 17:09.585
But now we gotta let 'em
bring in their fine-tooth combs

17:09.678 --> 17:11.845
and do their jobs.

17:11.939 --> 17:13.939
This entire room is
filled with evidence.

17:14.092 --> 17:16.776
That could lead us to our son.

17:16.928 --> 17:19.019
-Michael. Michael!
-What?!

17:19.039 --> 17:20.596
Do you just want me
to stand here

17:20.689 --> 17:21.931
and not do anything?

17:21.949 --> 17:23.374
Is that what you're
saying to me?

17:23.526 --> 17:25.209
How in the hell am I
supposed to do that, Athena?

17:25.361 --> 17:28.713
-He took our son and he's gone!
-Michael, hey. Hey, hey, hey!

17:28.864 --> 17:31.457
Look at me.
We're gonna find him.

17:31.551 --> 17:35.053
We're not done. Not yet.

17:37.782 --> 17:41.634
(crying):
I'm sorry.

17:41.786 --> 17:45.137
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Look, you can scream
all you want, kid.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.536
There's no one around to hear.

19:07.630 --> 19:10.873
Listen to me. Hey. Look.
I want you to know

19:10.966 --> 19:13.151
none of this is your fault.
Okay?

19:13.319 --> 19:15.227
It's not mine either. It's hers.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.472
Your mother can save you,
or she can come after me.

19:18.566 --> 19:20.241

three hours ago?
-Yeah.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.926
It took me a really long time
to upload the video.

19:47.078 --> 19:50.246
My connection kept dropping out.
I almost gave up.

19:50.264 --> 19:51.355
Thank you for doing this.

19:51.507 --> 19:53.082
You know, just to see his face,

19:53.100 --> 19:55.768
and to know that
he's still fighting...

19:55.862 --> 19:58.112
and that he's still alive...

19:59.365 --> 20:03.776
Now, tell me, what did you see
before the video?

20:03.928 --> 20:06.278
I mean, was he hurting Harry?

20:06.431 --> 20:08.097
They were struggling.
The guy was trying

20:08.115 --> 20:09.690
to get him back into the car.

20:09.784 --> 20:11.542
I knew that something was wrong,

20:11.694 --> 20:14.437
but then he showed me his badge.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.121
And you pulled out your phone.

20:16.274 --> 20:17.940
That was your son's idea.

20:17.959 --> 20:20.276
-He's a really smart kid.
-Yeah. (chuckles)

20:20.294 --> 20:23.946

34:49.237 --> 34:52.756

-Ask me tomorrow. (chuckles)

34:52.907 --> 34:54.532

Ah. Thought you'd be
the first one out the door.

35:11.017 --> 35:12.425
Christopher know you're coming?

35:12.444 --> 35:14.277
Not yet.

35:14.429 --> 35:17.155
I haven't figured out what
I'm gonna say when I get home.

I mean, you've been

A disaster. (laughs)

I'm sorry. I know
this place is such a wreck.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.409
Don't worry about it.

37:43.470 --> 37:46.579
Yeah, but you've been
working nonstop,

37:46.598 --> 37:50.392
so, you shouldn't have to
come home to this mess...

37:54.498 --> 37:57.941
Oh, I-I bet the dishwasher
is working now, right?

what I miss more,

-Or the air conditioning.

It's probably the-the
air conditioning, definitely.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.706
Ana. Ana, stop.

38:16.870 --> 38:19.212
We need to talk.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.218
Those four words.

38:26.546 --> 38:28.696
Maybe we should sit down.

38:28.715 --> 38:30.640
Why?

38:31.793 --> 38:33.643
You're fine.

38:33.870 --> 38:36.371
You're not gonna pass out

38:41.561 --> 38:44.470
You know what I mean.

38:45.640 --> 38:50.994
I don't want you to... to panic
when you think about me.

38:52.389 --> 38:54.998
Or when you think about
a future with me.

38:56.076 --> 39:01.421
I can't-- I can't take that.

39:02.899 --> 39:05.675
I thought it would work.

39:05.827 --> 39:10.663
I did. The idea of us.

Chris loves you so much.

39:16.838 --> 39:18.429
I just thought...

39:18.582 --> 39:23.026
That eventually you would, too?

39:23.253 --> 39:27.589
-I should have
said something sooner.
-Yeah.

39:27.607 --> 39:30.283
You probably should have.

39:32.371 --> 39:35.947
Well, I'm...

39:36.099 --> 39:37.782
sorry about the mess,

39:37.876 --> 39:41.861
but I guess it's...
it's your mess now.

-Right?
-Yeah, I guess it is.

40:01.958 --> 40:04.192

Hey, Christopher.

40:31.821 --> 40:33.430
Oh...

40:35.842 --> 40:37.175
Is it ironic that
all I want to do

40:37.269 --> 40:40.395
is close the blackout curtains
and go to sleep?

40:41.606 --> 40:43.231

40:56.955 --> 40:59.438
Ravi, what are you still
doing here?

40:59.458 --> 41:01.607
I was waiting for Cap
to get back.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.626
Yeah, he just called me in.
Where is he?

41:03.853 --> 41:05.753
Upstairs.

41:11.303 --> 41:14.212
Hey, Cap, what's going on?

41:14.364 --> 41:15.955
-What couldn't
you tell me over the...

41:15.974 --> 41:18.700
Jee-Yun.
What's my daughter doing here?

41:18.793 --> 41:21.311
When I came back
to wrap the shift, she was here.

41:21.538 --> 41:23.888
-Maddie was here?
-Not Maddie.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.373
The baby.

41:25.466 --> 41:27.391
Her mother dropped her off.

41:27.486 --> 41:30.211
What, with you?

41:30.230 --> 41:32.547
I was the only one here.

41:32.565 --> 41:35.474
I don't understand.
Where's Maddie?

41:35.494 --> 41:37.902
She's not here, Chim.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.246
She asked me to give you this.

<i>and no one is making me do this.</i>

42:14.941 --> 42:17.992
<i> But Jee is not safe with me.</i>

42:19.596 --> 42:22.664
<i> Not now, and maybe...</i>

42:30.290 --> 42:33.633
I know that you're gonna take
really good care of her.

42:36.796 --> 42:39.347
And she's better off without me.

42:49.809 --> 42:52.026
I love you.

42:53.797 --> 42:57.031
<i> I love both of you.</i>
