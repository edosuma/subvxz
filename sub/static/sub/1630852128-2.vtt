WEBVTT

00:19.811 --> 00:21.688
-Morning. How are you?
-Morning.

00:24.315 --> 00:28.737
There's still time to step up my game
and do things the way I should be doing.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.697
I don't wanna
take anything away from Juan,

00:30.780 --> 00:32.532
he did a lot of work
and it… it was beautiful,

00:32.615 --> 00:35.285
he delivered what he wanted to,
but I don't like being in the middle.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.496
Another day, another slay.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.291
If I had to say who was at the top,
I'd say Juan right now.

00:41.374 --> 00:45.503
Um, I don't really wanna say who I think
is at the bottom, 'cause that's not cool.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.632
But if I had to, it would be Tyricia,

00:49.716 --> 00:53.470
only because her rolling pin didn't have
handles, so it kinda looks like a tube.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.556
But better for me. Sorry, Tyricia.

00:57.057 --> 00:57.891
Um…

00:57.974 --> 01:00.351
-I know, right? Exciting.
-Ready to learn more.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.269
Absolutely.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.690
Both Juan and I have the skill set
and the knowledge for chocolate.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.193
At the end of the day,
this is a competition. Eye on the prize.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.111
I really would love to win.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.198
Now, Daniel has the best hair.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.325
Danny has the best hair.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.037
His hair is, like, so flawless and nice.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.915
It moves with him.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.756
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning, Chef.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.050
Morning burger.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.718
-Oh my God.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.303
-Insane.
-Can we eat it?

01:35.386 --> 01:36.387
Maybe.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.389
He brought out a little bitty burger.

01:38.473 --> 01:39.432


01:39.516 --> 01:42.227
Pickles and cheese. It's the works.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.853
Would you like to try it, guys?

01:43.937 --> 01:45.271
-Of course.
-Yeah!

01:48.274 --> 01:49.651
Bottoms up.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.111
-Mmm.

01:51.694 --> 01:52.529
Wow.

01:52.612 --> 01:53.988
-So good.
-Oh my God.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.574
It's like when you eat a burger.
It's a little bit messy.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.326
-Mm-hm.
-It should be.

01:58.409 --> 02:01.746
-Finger-licking.
-The buns are actually macarons.

02:02.747 --> 02:05.583
In between, we have a passion fruit paste

02:05.667 --> 02:07.085
who look like lettuce.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.212
Then we have a little bit of ketchup

02:09.295 --> 02:12.090
which is made
with strawberry and cranberry.

02:12.173 --> 02:15.927
Fake tomatoes who are a slow-cook
of slices of fresh mango

02:16.010 --> 02:17.679
in vanilla-cranberry juice.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.305
The patty is actually

02:19.389 --> 02:21.683
an exotic mango-pineapple compote

02:21.766 --> 02:23.101
with Tahitian vanilla,

02:23.184 --> 02:25.103
surrounded by a coconut mousse.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.939
And the mango-passion-fruit layer
of cheese.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.817
And on top,
you have my little kiwi pickles

02:31.526 --> 02:33.278
with an extra layer of ketchup.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.030
I like mine a little more rare,
but it's all right.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.116
-Oh my God, it was so good.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.451
You're seeing something
and you're expecting something,

02:40.535 --> 02:43.454
but when you bite into it,
it's a completely different world.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.499
Today, we're going to play with
natural additives.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.209
Agar-agar, pectin,

02:48.293 --> 02:49.919
gelatin, etc.

02:50.003 --> 02:54.465
Each of those additives can create
a very flexible and elastic component

02:54.549 --> 02:55.925
or something very soft.

02:56.509 --> 03:00.263
Agar-agar starts to activate
about 70 degrees Celsius,

03:00.346 --> 03:02.724
so you need to bring
your mix up to this point

03:02.807 --> 03:04.976
for it to start the jellification agents.

03:05.059 --> 03:09.147
You have to be cautious. Too much
will be plastic taste. It's not good.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.649
So you have to find
the right balance for it.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.152
We're going to take our liquid puree,

03:14.235 --> 03:15.987
pour it into our mats,

03:16.070 --> 03:18.281
and make sure we obtain a thin layer.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.825
It's gonna stabilize very quickly
and become firm.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.578
I'm going to cut my squares.

03:23.661 --> 03:24.746
As you can see,

03:24.829 --> 03:28.416
we're getting a very good reaction
and a very good flexibility.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.376
-Oh my.
-Look at that.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.088
Shiny, transparent,
just like a cheddar cheese.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.216
-Wow.
-Mind-blowing.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.508
I've never seen anyone do that.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.344
Well, I--
No, I've never seen anybody do it.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.096
Like, how does this man's mind work?

03:45.183 --> 03:49.187
Today's pastry exercise will be creating
a photo-realistic food item

03:49.270 --> 03:51.648
using various natural additives.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.985
Everything you add to your dessert
must have a specific taste purpose.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.403
Really think about flavor,

03:57.487 --> 04:00.156
and how we can still create
an illusion with that.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.534
It's pastry skills. I really want
to see the pastry chef within you.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.328
You have four and a half hours.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.122
I'm so excited
to see what you come up with.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.415
Are you ready?

04:09.999 --> 04:10.917
You should run.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.670
-Oh God.
-After you.

04:13.753 --> 04:14.587
I was like…

04:15.672 --> 04:17.674
Oh, I like this.
People are running.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.801
I like to see them push themselves.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.637
This challenge is so much fun.
There's so many ways you can go,

04:22.720 --> 04:26.391
and using these cake components,
it creates tons of options,

04:26.474 --> 04:27.850
so I'm really excited.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.310
Well, you have four hours.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.400
I am self-taught.
I… I've learned by watching.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.860
It pushes me to be more curious.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.613
I've had pastry cooks come work for me,

04:40.697 --> 04:43.449
and they have these blinders
that school put on them

04:43.533 --> 04:45.702
that you have to do this a certain way.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.079
I've been the guy
to take that out and try things.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.581
If it doesn't work,
it doesn't work. At least I tried.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.792
I know you got inspired
by an American thing.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.836
-I did.
-I got inspired by a French thing.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.629
-Okay.
-I wanna do a croque madame.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.007
-Okay.
-Something we love at home.

04:59.090 --> 05:02.635
And I'm actually gonna do a egg,
um, over easy versus sunny-side up.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.553
Okay.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.764
Which is my wife's favorite,
and you still have the impact of the egg.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.558
Still the oozing-out type of egg.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.976
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.063
I really thought, "Let me make
the egg out of the agar sheet,

05:14.147 --> 05:16.399
encase the yolk inside of that sheet."

05:16.482 --> 05:18.943
I mean, it's a big risk,
but as long as I can get the flavors,

05:19.027 --> 05:21.362
I know I have a…
a good shot on being on top.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.871
-Hello, Mellisa.
-Morning.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.873
Do you have a little sketch
of what you're doing?

05:31.956 --> 05:32.790
I do.

05:33.458 --> 05:37.503
I'm going to do a lobster roll.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.590
-A lobster roll…
-Mm-hmm.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.425
So, I'm not familiar with it.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.634
It's a, um…

05:43.718 --> 05:45.762
It's a bun with buttered lobster,

05:45.845 --> 05:48.973
and I'll have the mayonnaise,
and the celery, and the Tabasco.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.517
It's a thing in New England.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.605
My flavors are gonna be a twist
on a gin rickey. You know what that is?

05:55.688 --> 05:56.898
No.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.319
Chef doesn't know that either.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.696
So, I didn't make the smartest choice.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.616
That is… That is very me.

06:07.116 --> 06:10.912
I chose the lobster roll as a nod
to the last five years of my life.

06:10.995 --> 06:15.833
My husband and I, we opened a restaurant
together called The Hairy Lobster,

06:15.917 --> 06:18.753
which was a dream of ours together.

06:18.836 --> 06:22.006
We shut down because of COVID,

06:22.090 --> 06:24.342
and the governor just never let us reopen.

06:25.968 --> 06:30.848
Basically, your baby
that you have devoted your entire life to,

06:30.932 --> 06:34.977
and then to just have to essentially
leave everything in the building

06:35.061 --> 06:36.521
and walk away…

06:37.563 --> 06:39.899
It was heartbreaking.
It was really hard, honestly.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.443
I'm such at a crossroads with my career.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.363
Winning this would open up opportunities

06:45.446 --> 06:48.241
that I don't even…
Can't even fathom right now.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.044
I'm going to do a piece of sushi.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.589
Using some passion fruit,
some mango, some coconut.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.008
Are you gonna do your caviar
with agar and oil?

07:06.092 --> 07:07.385
-Is that the plan?
-Yes.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.470
It's almost like being back
in basic training.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.933
Sitting in a bunker in Afghanistan,
I decided to change careers,

07:14.016 --> 07:16.727
and that's when I decided
to go to pastry school.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.689
What are
the little pieces inside?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.692
-Uh, butter.
-Is it what you wanted?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.902
Not technically what I wanted,

07:24.986 --> 07:27.822
but it's a little cold for the butter
to be, like, smooth out as I want.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.283
-This is gonna be your illusion, right?
-Yes.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.785
-In your shoes, I'd scrape that.
-Okay.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.913
Warm it with a heat gun,
mix it, till you get it perfect, right?

07:35.997 --> 07:36.831
Yes, Chef.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.209
Sometimes it's better
to just scratch it and restart.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.378
I want to see you in the chocolate round.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.091
I felt confident
going into the last exercise,

07:47.175 --> 07:49.677
but I knew what mistakes I made.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.721
Him telling me, you know,

07:51.804 --> 07:54.390
that my flavors weren't great

07:54.474 --> 07:56.309
was like, taking a bullet, right?

07:56.392 --> 08:00.146
I want it to be so much better
the second time around.

08:08.613 --> 08:13.493
I am going to create a s'mores of sorts.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.703
-That will look like what?
-But, um…

08:15.786 --> 08:16.621
A s'mores.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.040
-It will look like a s'mores?
-Yes.

08:19.123 --> 08:22.627
But the flavor components are gonna be
different. So I'm gonna create a <i>sablé</i>,

08:22.710 --> 08:26.797
and I'm gonna sandwich
in between that, um, caramelized apples.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.508
And I'm gonna make a green apple mousse.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.676
Um, I still need to figure out
how to make it white,

08:30.760 --> 08:31.844
because it's gonna be green.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.056
So you're doing, uh,
a sweet food illusion,

08:35.139 --> 08:38.976
but substitute every component
for it to be something different, right?

08:39.060 --> 08:40.061
Yes.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.106
This is the first time I've done a, um…
a photo-realistic illusion.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.986
It's gonna be a challenge for me
to push myself out of that comfort zone

08:49.070 --> 08:51.822
to do something new,
um, innovative, and creative.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.116
He's taking a risk with the s'mores.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.702
-Is he the only one doing sweet?
-Yeah.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.455
And when I was younger,
and I wanted to compete,

08:59.539 --> 09:03.459
I was always thinking, "What could be
something that no one was thinking of?"

09:03.543 --> 09:06.087
and I think he went in that direction.

09:06.170 --> 09:09.632
It could help him score a lot of points,
but it's gonna be very hard.

09:09.715 --> 09:13.678
Oh, I know what I'm gonna do.
But I'm not gonna say it.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.723
As a young person, I think
one of the best ways to earn respect

09:17.807 --> 09:20.476
is to prove the fact that you are capable.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.979
Having won the first exercise
as an individual,

09:23.062 --> 09:28.150
and having, uh, won the second exercise
as a team, as the leader of that team,

09:28.234 --> 09:30.736
these seasoned professionals
might be like, "All right, he might…

09:31.237 --> 09:33.614
He might have more to bring
than we thought he did."

09:34.365 --> 09:36.534
-I like to see you run, Daniel.
-Yes, Chef.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.954
I'm actually gonna make
a Vietnamese spring roll.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.665
So you have shrimp,
lettuce, more vegetables,

09:42.748 --> 09:45.543
wrapped in a very thin spring roll paper.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.796
I'm gonna try to do that, uh, in pastry.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.508
Daniel is going to also do it

09:52.592 --> 09:54.176
the same way, uh, I did it,

09:54.260 --> 09:55.511
make all the elements

09:55.595 --> 09:56.846
and roll it last minute.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.264
So, I… I like that.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.308
Here we go.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.690
-What's your illusion gonna be?
-Oh, my illusion is a taco.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.067
Oh, awesome. Oh, look at that! Okay.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.944
Street tacos,
or tacos in general,

10:12.028 --> 10:14.155
are just something that's always,
like, my comfort food.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.991
My taco shell is a Hippen Masse
I added freeze-dried corn to.

10:17.074 --> 10:17.908
Okay.

10:17.992 --> 10:21.245
I'm doing the caramel popcorn,
put it in chocolate, um, yummy glaze

10:21.329 --> 10:23.164
for, like, the meat portion.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.081
Okay.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.542
The cheese part,
I roasted some sweet potatoes,

10:26.626 --> 10:29.670
and I'm, um, gonna blend it
and thicken it with a little agar.

10:29.754 --> 10:30.713
Yep.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.341
The most difficult part
was figuring out the components

10:33.424 --> 10:35.468
and how I'm gonna reuse each component,

10:35.551 --> 10:37.094
'cause I've never, um,

10:37.595 --> 10:42.099
used this much, like, agar in my recipes.
I'm really confident in it.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.852
I feel like it's got
the perfect balance of sweetness.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.731
Going in for the kill
with the flavors is my strong point.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.068
No one else is gonna do corn,
so I think that's gonna make me stand out,

10:52.151 --> 10:53.611
and I'm excited for it.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.323
Okay, chefs, we are at two hours.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.741
How's everybody feeling?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.534
-Good, Chef.
-Yes?

11:10.211 --> 11:12.630
Tyricia, are the scallop coming together?

11:12.713 --> 11:16.175
Gonna get them in the blaster,
then I can start my details.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.346
Of course, first week I started
on the bottom, so that was really, really…

11:20.429 --> 11:21.889
It was really sucky.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.265
What do you think?

11:23.349 --> 11:26.560
My-- I was gonna, um…
'Cause I want the shininess, like,

11:26.644 --> 11:29.647
the scallop's shiny,
but I also need the caramelization.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.358
The safe bet would be
airbrushing just the top.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.944
-Mm-hmm.
-Or you can even try to burn it.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.531
That's more tricky, you know, but…
Go with the safe bet.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.157
-It's okay. Just this part.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.743
-I mean, I have extra this time for sure.
-So give it a try.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.956
Today, I'm thinking faster.
I guess my creative juices are going.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.625
Just been trying
to keep growing and keep striving

11:49.709 --> 11:52.211
to be the best Tyricia I can be.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.508
I think she's going to succeed.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.512
No? Is it working? She's going blowtorch.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.849
-How is it, Tyricia? It works?

12:04.932 --> 12:07.476
-It does it.
-Amazing. Bold move.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.271
-Look at that smile.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.316
I'm about to start building my ravioli.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.864
The first one I did, paste was too thick.
So I wanna make sure that it's super…

12:19.947 --> 12:22.241
-You need to have it thin.
-Exactly. Super thin.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.619
Because the marzipan
steals a lot of flavor,

12:25.703 --> 12:28.456
and I don't want that
to take away from everything else.

12:28.539 --> 12:32.084
Being best in class last time,
it really put a lot of pressure on me

12:32.168 --> 12:33.919
because I have everybody's eyes on me.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.797
I don't wanna go, like,
win and the next day be on the bottom.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.466
Definitely don't wanna do that.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.844
-Guys, you have 30 minutes left.
-Yes, Chef.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.596
-Thank you.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.268
The idea was
to build it like a normal spring roll.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.270
And I was trying
to wrap it like a spring roll,

12:51.353 --> 12:53.898
but they just kept cracking.
I'm beating myself up.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.360
I'm a little behind.
I didn't have time to taste everything,

12:58.444 --> 13:01.697
and I jeopardized the flavor
of the composition of what I was doing.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.990
Just tried to do too much.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.158
Oh no.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.119
Everybody should be putting food
on plates now, okay?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.663
-Perfect.
-Yes, Chef.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.956
How long? Time?

13:11.040 --> 13:14.001
-Five minutes.
-Is anybody free right now?

13:14.084 --> 13:17.046
-Anything I can help you with?
-Can you give me a plate wipe?

13:17.129 --> 13:18.756
-Plate wipe?
-Yeah.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.843
Thiago, one minute.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.386
-One minute left.
-<i>Oui</i>, Chef.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.763
Yes, Chef.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.765
-I do too much.
-What do you need?

13:27.848 --> 13:30.518
-Top it up with some onions on the salad?
-Yeah.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.855
Three, two,

13:35.731 --> 13:36.565
one.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.483
Done.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.446
Chefs, please bring me your creations
so we can have a little rap session.

13:52.832 --> 13:56.544
I want to start
by saying it's visually impressive.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.421
Now, you know
what matters the most in a dessert?

13:59.505 --> 14:00.965
It's the flavor, the texture.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.759
Let's see
if I'm gonna become a loyal customer.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.804
-Stephanie, let's start with you.
-Yeah. Please.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.223
Visually,
you did a very good job.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.933
It does look like a taco.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.853
I used traditional
Hippen Masse tuile as the taco shell,

14:13.936 --> 14:16.021
and I added a little bit
of freeze-dried corn to it.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.692
Some caramel popcorn
for the ground beef portion,

14:19.775 --> 14:23.404
a lemon-scented white chocolate paste
for the lettuce.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.532
The cheese portion
is actually roasted sweet potato

14:26.615 --> 14:27.825
set with a bit of agar.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.660
Seven completely different flavors.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.705
It's surprisingly not a bad blend.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.248
You can also feel the corn.

14:34.331 --> 14:37.126
It's bold, and I think
it was well incorporated.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.377
It's good.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.920
Cool. Thank you, Chef.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.300
-I want to do the croque madame.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.509
-<i>Oui</i>, Chef.
-Thiago.

14:45.593 --> 14:49.096
No pressure.
Little cracked black pepper for your egg.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.515
-Please. Demonstrate.
-Um, yeah. Sure.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.853
-So this is just cacao nibs.
-Stop.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.816
Some of your elements
are so realistic, it's mind-blowing.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.485
-Is it gonna be runny when I cut through?
-Yeah.

15:07.948 --> 15:08.782
Oh God.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.245
-Just how I like them.
-My wife likes over-medium.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.541
It's a coconut cake.
Uh, the mango yuzu for the yolk.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.921
There's a little rum custard.
The ham is a strawberry chocolate.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.381
What overwhelms me is the coconut.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.968
I don't think
you miscrafted any of your items,

15:28.052 --> 15:29.929
but I think maybe the ratio is not right.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.472
I just ran out of time.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.974
Sometimes more is less.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.100
Yep.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.518
-Or less is more?
-Yes.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.979
-Sometimes less is more.
-Story of my life.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.982
Amanda. What is it?

15:42.066 --> 15:43.943
-It is ikura sushi.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.194
Never seen that before.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.030
-I'm kidding, Amanda.
-Yeah.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.951
It's very photo-realistic to me.
The colors are very accurate.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.327
The caviar is good.

15:53.410 --> 15:57.164
Ribbon sponge around the outside,
a white chocolate-coconut mousse,

15:57.247 --> 15:58.832
coconut rice pudding,

15:58.916 --> 16:01.877
passion fruit pearls caviar on the top.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.967
-Look, he's crying, it's so good.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.015
You nailed the… the little caviar.
Sometimes they're a bit too plasticky.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.226
Those were actually melting,
which is good.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.770
-Perfect cooking on the rice pudding.
-Thank you.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.356
-Nervous about that one.
-No, you did good.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.025
Overall, all the elements
were nicely executed,

16:25.109 --> 16:26.777
and you did it on time.

16:26.860 --> 16:27.695
On time.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.781
And you help, uh, Thiago too,
which was very nice of you.

16:30.864 --> 16:31.740
Yes.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.826
Never leave a fallen soldier.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.747
Tyricia. Let's see.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.378
The caramelization around is well done.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.381
I know you've had fun with the…
the blowtorch,

16:47.464 --> 16:48.882
which was again a bold move.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.509
Why did you choose that shape?

16:50.592 --> 16:53.595
I was too afraid to try and do
my own mold again.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.931
-So I went with the molds that we had.
-Okay.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.267
-I was too traumatized from it.
-Because… I…

16:58.350 --> 16:59.393
The only thing,

16:59.476 --> 17:01.979
if you're talking food illusion,

17:02.062 --> 17:03.689
the conic shape for me

17:03.772 --> 17:05.566
doesn't cut it as like a scallop.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.903
-Shall I go ahead?
-Go in.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.573
Lemon, berry, are my flavors.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.284
Uh, I have a strawberry ruby ganache,

17:15.367 --> 17:18.245
raspberry confit, and then a lemon sponge.

17:18.328 --> 17:21.165
Overall, it stands,
all the components are here,

17:21.248 --> 17:24.460
but for me,
there is no magic on the overall balance.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.049
-Cedrick.
-I have made for you a s'mores.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.510
-Remind me, what's the component?
-It's a vanilla <i>sablé</i>.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.262
And you replace a <i>sablé</i>

17:35.345 --> 17:36.680
by a <i>sablé</i>.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.183
So I know graham crackers is different,
but, you know…

17:39.266 --> 17:40.100
Mm-hmm.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.436
…orange, orange.
If you substitute the <i>sablé</i>,

17:42.519 --> 17:47.232
I would've expected something not crunchy.
That when I try it, I'm like, "Wow."

17:47.316 --> 17:50.569
I'm seeing a perfect s'more,
you know, like, oozing out,

17:50.652 --> 17:53.697
and then I bite into it,
and it's tropical,

17:53.781 --> 17:56.992
and it has nothing to do with chocolate,
with graham crackers.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.871
So, I hope it's delicious,
but as far as the technical execution,

18:00.954 --> 18:02.956
I think you were a little bit off-topic.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.425
So it's light, it's fresh,
but chocolate is a little bit thick.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.470
When you have that thick
of a chocolate component with caramel,

18:16.553 --> 18:17.763
it takes over everything.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.099
Would you mind
giving it a little try for me?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.480
Personally, I like it, yes.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.525
It's pleasing to me.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.154
It's just not what I asked you to do.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.072
Yes.

18:36.865 --> 18:37.699
Daniel.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.743
The idea was
to have two spring rolls,

18:39.827 --> 18:43.539
but as I was rolling near the end,
I kept losing a few of the, uh, jellies.

18:44.123 --> 18:48.168
The problem is, when I see it,
it's not as detailed as what I'd imagine.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.380
I wish you would've been
a little bit thicker.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.548
Mm-hmm.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.008
The inside looks like
a spring roll.

18:55.092 --> 18:58.846
It's rare that a dessert looks better
on the inside than on the outside.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.764
-Let's try this.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.230
-The taste is all over the place.
-Okay.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.524
-Flavor-wise, texture-wise.
-Mm-hmm.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.068
This part
is a little bit not sufficient.

19:16.029 --> 19:19.575
-Mellisa.
-Your first lobster roll.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.493
I did educate myself

19:21.577 --> 19:23.287
on what a lobster roll is.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.371
Love the claw.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.789
Love the fake mayo.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.749
It's clever and it looks very good.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.628
As cute as the claw is,

19:31.712 --> 19:35.632
because it's such a small item
to dip into the yummy glaze,

19:35.716 --> 19:37.509
you can really feel the chocolate,

19:37.593 --> 19:41.680
and I think it takes away from the taste
of the actual cream inside.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.600
Taste-wise, you have a little bit of work.
Thank you, Mellisa.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.021
Juan, I want to travel
to Italy for a moment.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.607
<i>-Bienvenido a l'Italian.</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:56.486
Your foam, the oil,

19:56.570 --> 19:59.865
you really took that picture in time
and gave it to me.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.743
It's a hard thing to do,
so good job on that.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.831
Flavor profiles is gonna be almond,
uh, strawberry, and coconut.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.919
The texture is great, it's light,
but the marzipan is overpowering.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.339
It was part of the exercise.
Everything you bring to the table,

20:15.422 --> 20:18.675
you know, must, like, balance
and bring all the other flavor,

20:18.759 --> 20:20.719
and this one is overpowering it.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.263
It saddens me.

20:24.681 --> 20:28.685
I was definitely feeling defeated,
and I was not happy,

20:28.769 --> 20:32.231
because I definitely knew
I was a little bit disappointed on myself.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.234
I could have done so much better
because I know I can.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.488
I was visually pleased
by every single one of you.

20:39.571 --> 20:43.242
On that part,
you did not let me down. Today's leaders…

20:46.495 --> 20:47.704
are Stephanie…

20:47.788 --> 20:48.997
Thank you, Chef.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.459
…and Amanda.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.009
I'm super happy to have this one because,

21:01.093 --> 21:04.221
you know,
it shows that I'm meant to be here.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.348
After the first exercise,
I wasn't so sure,

21:06.431 --> 21:09.184
but Chef Amaury picked me
to be here for a reason, right,

21:09.268 --> 21:13.188
and I got to be able to prove that to him,
and nobody can take that away from me.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.567
All right, who's ready
to taste this disaster?

21:17.651 --> 21:20.195
-Ha, ha. Mine as well.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.282
-Congrats, Stephanie and Amanda.
-Thank you so much.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.201
-Really well deserved.
-Congrats.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.162
I won a challenge
because of my flavor choices.

21:29.246 --> 21:33.333
My flavors, he's acknowledging that,
and he's realizing that, like,

21:33.417 --> 21:35.627
that's where my main expertise is.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.587
Oh my God. I was so shocked.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.133
I was… I… I, um… See?
I'm still kinda speechless about it.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.634
-Hey, y'all.
-Hi.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.095
-Great job today, everybody.
-Thank you.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.180
Daniel, Chef would like to speak with you.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.223
Of course.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.226
-Come on, Daniel. Take a seat.
-Thank you, Chef.

21:51.768 --> 21:54.688
-How are you feeling?
-Again, like I said, I'm not surprised.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.899
To be honest, and when the time ended,
seeing the product,

21:57.983 --> 22:00.319
I… I wasn't 100%, like I said,

22:00.402 --> 22:01.987
with… with what I came up with.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.156
It's hard for me
to see you in that seat.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.908
By now, you know the drill.
You know that if you're in the bottom two,

22:06.992 --> 22:09.369
you're not participating
to the chocolate showpiece.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.788
-Which I know is one of your strengths.
-Yeah.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.498
I know you don't wanna be here.

22:13.582 --> 22:18.420
Not at all. But going forward,
I really do need to nail flavor, texture.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.089
Those are the two main things
I think I'm lacking in right now.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.051
When I was 21,
I was exactly in that seat.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.260
Stay humble.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.221
I do see a lot in you
that is going to grow,

22:28.305 --> 22:31.516
and your age is by no means a problem.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.686
-Hey, guys, it's me again.
-Hi.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.521
Cedrick,
Chef would like to speak with you.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.564
-No.
-Okay.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.441
-Okay.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.692
Right this way.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.740
-How are you feeling?
-I'm feeling okay.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.492
-Okay?
-Yes.

22:48.575 --> 22:52.829
It's hard to crack that
very protective shell you have around you

22:52.913 --> 22:54.831
to get to know the true Cedrick.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.958
I'm trying to--

22:57.042 --> 23:02.047
Not trying to, it's like I'm slowly, like,
allowing myself to get the gears turning.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.716
Because I've done one thing for so long,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.343
it's difficult to break that.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.969
-Thanks for being honest.
-Yes.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.014
I know it's hard sometimes to…
to say things like that.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.642
I just want to ask one thing from you.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.060
Stay open-minded.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.564
I think I'll be very grounded
by the end of this thing.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.234
-No, but it's so true.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.403
When he was grading me, and he said…

23:24.903 --> 23:27.948
-Like, "You were so close."
-I know. It hurts so much.

23:28.031 --> 23:32.202
He was like,
"You were right there to nailing this."

23:32.285 --> 23:34.037
Yeah, it hurts more
when he goes, like…

23:34.121 --> 23:35.247
when he gets disappointed.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.707
Even though
I wasn't the bottom of the barrel,

23:37.791 --> 23:40.627
I… I wasn't happy with what I did,
with what I put out.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.092
You know,
go for your dream, go for it all.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.928
I had a dream to go to school.
I couldn't make that happen.

23:50.011 --> 23:53.807
But every position I've ever been in,
I've always worked my way to the top,

23:53.890 --> 23:55.684
and people always looked
for me for leadership.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.270
<i>Hey, Daddy.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

23:58.353 --> 24:00.230
I'm in school. Chocolate school.

24:00.897 --> 24:03.650
<i>I'm cheering for you.</i>
-<i>You're cheering for him?</i>

24:03.733 --> 24:04.943
Thank you, buddy.

24:05.026 --> 24:08.780
I… I haven't been this far away
from them for a long time.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.199
Now I have to start winning.
Daddy has to do better.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.785
Daddy's been sucking. But I miss you guys.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.582
I have two beautiful boys,
James and Jackson. I miss them. Well…

24:23.962 --> 24:25.088
I'm here to…

24:25.172 --> 24:27.799
to win this for me,
but also for my family,

24:27.883 --> 24:30.093
and to show them
that you're never really too old

24:30.177 --> 24:31.887
or too far in your career, um,

24:31.970 --> 24:34.764
that you can't learn new things
or go for your dream, go for it all.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.016
I love you.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.435
-<i>Bye, Daddy.</i>
-Bye, bud.

24:38.518 --> 24:41.354
So, I'm gonna try
to do my best to impress Amaury

24:41.438 --> 24:43.398
and hopefully come away with the title.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.119
Oh no.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.538
-Oh Lord.
-Oh!

24:58.622 --> 24:59.789
Ah!

25:04.044 --> 25:05.837
Oh, I love it!

25:05.921 --> 25:07.255
Wow!

25:07.339 --> 25:09.090
Let's look at that.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.302
Six, seven feet tall.
You felt like he was looking at you.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.137
-Wow.
-Sheesh.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.391
-Like a play on a cocoa tree?
-It is a cocoa pod.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.061
-The water effect is cool.
-Super cool.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.107
-Hi!
-Morning.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.442
You like Father Nature?

25:27.526 --> 25:29.653
-Beautiful.
-Yes!

25:29.736 --> 25:33.073
Today's theme is nature-inspired,

25:33.156 --> 25:37.202
and we're going to focus
on shining cocoa butter.

25:38.078 --> 25:41.540
When you walk in,
what catches the light is the water.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.124
Glossy shininess.

25:43.208 --> 25:47.462
You attract the eyes
to elements you want to highlight.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.422
Today, I'm going to demonstrate

25:49.506 --> 25:52.384
how to get the perfect gloss
on the water drop.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.261
We're gonna go to the spray booth,

25:55.053 --> 25:56.888
apply the first layer of white,

25:57.973 --> 25:59.724
and then apply a very deep blue.

26:00.809 --> 26:04.354
In order to have the perfect shine,
we want something smooth.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.480
How do we do it?

26:05.564 --> 26:08.483
Well, we do something I call do-or-dye.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.153
We're going to use the heat gun

26:12.237 --> 26:15.323
to blend all the cocoa butter
to create a smooth surface.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.827
All right. Once it's set,

26:18.910 --> 26:20.704
start the polishing process.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.539
With my warm water,

26:22.622 --> 26:24.666
slide onto the cocoa butter.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.960
-It's like you shine your shoes, right?
-Mm-hmm.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.962
To perfect the gloss.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.924
Creating that shiny piece
was really incredible.

26:33.008 --> 26:37.304
Getting behind that,
you know, secret door that he has

26:37.387 --> 26:39.180
and getting to learn that technique

26:39.264 --> 26:41.975
was super, I mean, amazing.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.811
We're now going to pick the team.

26:44.894 --> 26:49.149
I just want to remind you that today
Daniel and Cedrick won't be involved

26:49.232 --> 26:51.943
with the crafting
of the showpiece, unfortunately.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.696
The winner of this chocolate showpiece
will get closer

26:54.779 --> 26:56.489
to receiving the final award.

26:57.240 --> 27:01.578
Amanda and Stephanie,
choose wisely your teammates.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.497
Stephanie, you're gonna go first
and pick one person for me.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.792
Um, my first pick would be Mellisa.

27:07.876 --> 27:11.421
I picked Mellisa first
because I think she is very underrated,

27:11.504 --> 27:13.548
and I know her drive and her work ethic,

27:13.632 --> 27:16.760
and the way she works so clean
is what I wanted to bring to my team.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.637
-Now you, Amanda.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.892
I'm gonna pick my girl Tyricia.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.810
-Tyricia.

27:25.894 --> 27:29.105
We were both in the bottom
in the first exercise, you know.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.484
We bonded,
and we both had something to prove.

27:32.567 --> 27:36.363
-Stephanie, what is your second pick?
-For my second pick, I choose Chef Juan.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.530
Juan.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.409
Well, that means I get Thiago.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.747
-She's stuck with me.
-"Well, I guess… I guess Thiago."

27:45.830 --> 27:48.667
-Good, uh, good choice, Amanda.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.584
Wise.

27:50.627 --> 27:54.381
So today you are going to craft
a nature-inspired showpiece

27:54.464 --> 27:57.133
that must include a shiny element.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.011
It will also have to be 50 inches tall.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.224
-Fifty?
-Fifty inches, minimum.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.559
-Five-zero, right?
-Five-zero.

28:06.643 --> 28:12.065
I've done really heavy showpieces
that weigh over, you know, 100 pounds.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.901
Fifty inches, though,
is… is just a whole new level.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.820
-Are you excited?
-Yeah.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.488
-Go.
-Cool.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.201
-Go, go, come on.
-Hey. Over there?

28:23.284 --> 28:26.663
-How do you wanna do it?
-What does nature mean to us?

28:26.746 --> 28:28.456
I just think nature, I think water.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.750
-What you think when you think of nature?
-Water.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.586
I just like dolphins,
but that's not necessarily the reason

28:33.670 --> 28:35.588
we have to do it,
because it's not…

28:35.672 --> 28:36.715
Right? That's just me.

28:36.798 --> 28:40.176
How are you gonna support all the weight
if it's jumping out of the water?

28:41.970 --> 28:44.013
Our whole structure
is gonna be the elephant.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.224
Yeah.
I think the more body we do,

28:46.307 --> 28:48.059
the easier it is for us to get the height.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.312
They're actually starting
this thing where they dye the tusk,

28:51.396 --> 28:52.897
so that could be our shiny element.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.733
If they're doing that,
I think that's cool.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.360
Just so they wouldn't kill 'em for it.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.988
I mean, if there's a legit story
from that, why not?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.867
What if we started
to think about a bird?

29:03.950 --> 29:06.453
-Yeah, let's have something…
-So, what are really colorful birds?

29:06.953 --> 29:07.996
Toucans.

29:08.079 --> 29:11.040
I mean, it's interesting.
What about a flamingo?

29:12.876 --> 29:14.711
You just
completely stressed me out.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.504
No, it's not. Don't be stressed out.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.883
-A flamingo is pretty. Flamingo is pretty.
-That's just word vomiting.

29:21.009 --> 29:21.968
Imagine a flamingo?

29:23.094 --> 29:25.597
But flamingo,
his legs are really thin.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.850
-That's a big risk. Let's…
-Okay. I'm gonna start grinding chocolate.

29:28.933 --> 29:32.187
You guys decide
what we're gonna do, and then we'll do it.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.606
What do you want each of us to do, Amanda?

29:34.689 --> 29:37.358
I want you
to get going on the base part.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.860
Okay. Building the body.

29:38.943 --> 29:42.864
I'm gonna build some columns for support,
and then build the skeleton around that,

29:42.947 --> 29:43.782
and we can tie it in.

29:43.865 --> 29:48.495
Tyricia, you work on the tusks,
the trunk, and then the ears as well.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.498
Can you handle that?

29:53.583 --> 29:57.879
-I'll make it. If not, I'll call you.
-All right. Let's go get some chocolate.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.965
We're gonna crush this, y'all.
We're gonna crush it.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.849
Why not do something
that you're like, "I wanna do this."

30:09.933 --> 30:12.227
If it's a dolphin,
it can be a dolphin.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.478
-There's no judgment.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.395
Yeah.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.940
Like, if you really wanna do it,
if you're excited about it,

30:17.023 --> 30:19.400
then Juan and I will jump on that train.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.654
I'm gonna need help rig…
like, sculpting that dolphin, though.

30:22.737 --> 30:24.948
I want you guys
to wanna be on board with it.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.825
Then let's do it.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.035
Can we build a palm tree
next to the dolphin

30:29.118 --> 30:32.789
so there's a landscape of a beach scene
somehow next to the dolphin?

30:32.872 --> 30:35.834
-Wouldn't make sense because…
-No. We cannot do that.

30:35.917 --> 30:36.751
The dolphin is…

30:36.835 --> 30:39.671
The dolphin, like, yeah,
they're not next to a palm tree.

30:39.754 --> 30:40.588
It will be…

30:40.672 --> 30:43.550
But what other elements
are we gonna create around the dolphin?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.218
-A sea scene under the water?
-Yes.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.763
So if you wanna do the dolphin,
we can create the splash.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.014
-Like this.
-Yeah.

30:50.098 --> 30:55.019
And then what if your splash was created
all out of plastic junk in the ocean?

30:55.103 --> 30:56.729
That's really smart.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.774
That's, like, where my head is at,
but it's, like, getting it out.

31:01.317 --> 31:04.404
I'll work on the trash if you guys
wanna concentrate on the dolphin.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.197
-Does that work for you?
-Yeah.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.283
-Are you excited?
-Okay. Yeah. I am.

31:11.619 --> 31:15.540
Being chosen as a team leader,
I was excited about it at first,

31:15.623 --> 31:17.333
but I know
it comes with a lot of pressure,

31:17.417 --> 31:20.420
and it was only the second
chocolate showpiece challenge,

31:20.503 --> 31:24.966
so I still felt a little bit new
in my element as well,

31:25.049 --> 31:27.176
and I didn't want
to push myself to a point

31:27.260 --> 31:30.054
where I wasn't comfortable
with what we were doing.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.639
But that's exactly where we went.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.435
Fifty inches is a lot.

31:35.518 --> 31:38.771
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie,
I'm a little nervous about our idea.

31:38.855 --> 31:42.609
I mean, I have the two people
who didn't do it the last challenge.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.027
How do you think I feel?

31:44.110 --> 31:47.822
I do like the bouquet at the top,
like him holding a bouquet of flowers.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.701
So, if you can add that to your task list?

31:51.784 --> 31:53.828
My strength is not in flowers.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.288
-Just so you know.
-Okay.

31:55.371 --> 31:58.541
-So, I mean, never ever.
-I got you. I got you.

31:58.625 --> 32:04.172
Amanda leading our team
was a little confusing for me.

32:04.255 --> 32:07.675
All right.
Gonna start working on the flowers, then.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.427
Her career is a teacher.

32:09.510 --> 32:13.640
Teachers are there in culinary school
to support and let your creatives run.

32:13.723 --> 32:17.393
It being my first chocolate exercise,

32:17.477 --> 32:21.981
I needed her to more so,
like, manage me than to support.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.778
Trust me with the structure.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.447
My full trust is in you.
That's why I wanted you on the team.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.115
-I'll let…

32:31.199 --> 32:33.826
-I'll let that structure be sound.

32:33.910 --> 32:37.163
I have to keep climbing
because Juan is ahead right now,

32:37.246 --> 32:39.666
you know, winning best in class day one,

32:39.749 --> 32:41.793
and, um, I need to do better.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.711
I really need to step up my game.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.964
Right now,
it's taller than it needs to be.

32:46.047 --> 32:49.133
-I need to cut, um, a couple inches off.
-Yep. Let's do that.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.929
I don't want more than one person
working on the structure part of it.

32:53.012 --> 32:55.473
I feel like,
if I'm responsible for the structure,

32:55.556 --> 32:57.934
that thing collapses,
I'll take the heat for it.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.477
I'm gonna rattle off the colors.

32:59.560 --> 33:04.065
Tell me if I'm missing any. Pink, ivory,
white, gray, black. Should we do brown?

33:06.234 --> 33:08.736
-Ah!
-Oh, these popped over here too?

33:09.737 --> 33:11.322
I got a bad cut.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.617
There. It's pretty bad.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.036
-Medic.
-I need medic.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.917
-I felt faint. It is bad.
-Here. Come and sit here.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.585
Like, on a scale of one to ten…

33:24.669 --> 33:26.921
-It probably hit the bone.
-Oh.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.675
-Oh my God.
-What were you doing?

33:30.758 --> 33:36.097
Slicing through the chocolate,
and it sliced pretty fast, so…

33:36.931 --> 33:40.518
You got a pretty good cut.
You need to go to the ER, get stitched up.

33:41.728 --> 33:45.231
I mean, is there any way
to get me patched up to do this challenge?

33:45.314 --> 33:47.150
I can't stop the bleeding here,
okay?

33:48.651 --> 33:49.485
All right?

33:51.904 --> 33:54.699
Don't worry about your team.
This is the priority.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.826
-You gotta keep your finger, okay?
-Yeah.

34:03.875 --> 34:04.751
Bad.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.753
Like, you-have-to-go bad?

34:06.836 --> 34:08.671
It's… It's, like, dangling.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.298
Oh my God.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.633
-You guys got it.
-Come with me.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.845
Someone's gonna take you
to the hospital, okay?

34:15.928 --> 34:17.847
-Yeah.

34:17.930 --> 34:22.060
-So you wanna build it together?
-Yes. Get as much done as we can.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.730
The elephant was initially Thiago's idea.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.482
He had the vision for the base.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.566
My heart just sank.

34:29.192 --> 34:32.236
Hey, ladies. We don't know
how long Thiago will be gone.

34:32.320 --> 34:36.324
I'm gonna let you choose between Daniel
or Cedrick to give you a hand.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.576
-I'm like, "Thank God!"

34:38.659 --> 34:42.288
Because if it was just me and Amanda,
there would've been no showpiece.

34:42.371 --> 34:45.500
-Who do you want to help you?
-Daniel.

34:47.335 --> 34:51.130
-All righty, friends. Fill me in, please.
-We need to get this body up.

34:51.214 --> 34:55.718
So we're essentially going for, like,
paneling so that it builds up the area?

34:55.802 --> 34:58.054
Right. And then we're gonna
plop chocolate on for the body.

34:58.137 --> 35:01.224
-And then shave and all that stuff.
-Yes. Let's do the body.

35:01.307 --> 35:03.935
-Let's go. We got this.
-All right. Let's do this!

35:04.018 --> 35:08.272
I was happy to get my hands on chocolate.
This is an opportunity to redeem myself

35:08.356 --> 35:10.191
in this specific exercise.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.235
Let me just help them as much as I can

35:12.819 --> 35:14.362
and deliver on their vision,

35:14.445 --> 35:15.905
'cause the clock is ticking.

35:24.789 --> 35:25.915
Daniel!

35:26.415 --> 35:28.417
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.419
Right now, my biggest competition…

35:30.503 --> 35:31.504
Definitely Daniel.

35:31.587 --> 35:35.800
He has such a natural talent to chocolate.

35:35.883 --> 35:37.301
He just goes to his home.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.637
-Headed in the right direction.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.097
-For sure.
-We're good.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.476
-Mmm. It's set already.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.271
-What?
-It's… It's…

35:48.354 --> 35:49.480
It set so fast,

35:50.439 --> 35:53.109
that we have to… I have to redo it.

35:53.860 --> 35:57.697
I…
I set up a bowl full of chocolate.

35:57.780 --> 36:01.367
Like, I literally put chocolate
in a bowl and then forgot about it.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.535
Oh shoot!

36:03.661 --> 36:06.080
You know, I'm so sorry.
I'm just a little bit distracted today.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.332
Like, why would I even, like, do that?

36:12.503 --> 36:15.006
Starting to sculpt on such a weak point

36:15.089 --> 36:18.342
and adding and adding before the chocolate
has time to fully set,

36:18.426 --> 36:19.635
it's… it's a risk.

36:21.929 --> 36:23.973
Ah! It's falling over here.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.475
-You okay?

36:26.559 --> 36:30.188
-No, we need help.
-What happened?

36:31.898 --> 36:33.900
-Yeah, you see? It broke already.
-Oh no.

36:34.483 --> 36:36.986
-Yep.
-I can still build him from here.

36:37.069 --> 36:37.904
It's actually better.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.573
Then we can actually…
I can see while we're building,

36:40.656 --> 36:43.910
and then later on,
we can really, uh, glue it really nicely.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.119
-Attach it?
-Attach it.

36:47.121 --> 36:50.666
I just feel like keep doing things
without really thinking about it.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.211
Mellisa could start working
on the water.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.380
-If we're gonna have it all separate now.
-Yes. Yeah, no problem.

36:58.799 --> 37:01.385
I feel like
my brain is just stressed.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.680
Because two years ago today,

37:04.764 --> 37:06.557
that was the day
that actually my mom passed.

37:08.392 --> 37:09.602
My ma had cancer.

37:10.102 --> 37:13.105
I was really close with my mom.
Every single day, we talked.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.483
She is the reason why I work so hard.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.071
And when you have
every single member of your family

37:20.154 --> 37:22.782
texting you, sending you pictures,

37:22.865 --> 37:25.534
you start getting
all of these memories back.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.622
So, in my head,
I was just, like, devastated.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.381
It's cracking a little.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.593
-Little structure issue?
-Yes.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.220
So, it's broken over here,

37:44.804 --> 37:47.139
and that's pretty much
where the weight's gonna be.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.016
It cracked there too.
Did you see?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.060
This is
where your strength should be,

37:51.143 --> 37:53.854
and right now, it's broken,
so that means it's broken at core.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.316
I don't want
to give you the bad news…

37:58.943 --> 38:03.364
but restarting will be the fastest option.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.451
Basically, the first six hours
of the whole challenge,

38:07.535 --> 38:08.911
they went all to the garbage.

38:08.995 --> 38:12.665
I know you know what you're doing.
Sometimes you need someone to tell you,

38:12.748 --> 38:13.916
but you already know it.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.419
I just feel bad
because I feel like I'm failing them.

38:16.502 --> 38:18.087
You can still make it on time.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.339
-You should go part by part.
-Mm-hmm.

38:20.423 --> 38:21.799
Get the perfect roundness,

38:21.882 --> 38:25.636
put it in the fridge, let it set,
take it back, build a second layer.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.554
You can do it.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.848
-Yeah, I…
-Thank you, Chef.

38:28.931 --> 38:31.434
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.935
That was kinda, like, my click.

38:33.019 --> 38:36.689
You need to get out of your head,
because if you keep getting in your head,

38:36.772 --> 38:38.691
you're not gonna get this done.

38:38.774 --> 38:39.608
Poopers.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.820
-It's frustrating 'cause you spent time.
-Big poopers.

38:42.903 --> 38:46.782
How's he sitting on here?
He's gonna go this way?

38:48.117 --> 38:52.246
Um, we can cut those
out of the way if we need to cut it out.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.874
No, I want you to tell me
where to leave it blank.

38:54.957 --> 38:57.043
The idea was not
fully fleshed out.

38:57.126 --> 38:59.670
I personally work better

38:59.754 --> 39:03.341
if I know exactly what's supposed to be.

39:03.424 --> 39:07.178
Right where this one is.
With that back part. Yeah. Like that.

39:07.261 --> 39:10.556
I took over something I would've started
in a much different way,

39:10.639 --> 39:12.850
which would've given
a better product in the end.

39:12.933 --> 39:16.270
-This is where the dolphin's gonna fit.
-Mm-hmm. Oh my…

39:16.354 --> 39:18.272
I know.
Sorry. I didn't break it.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.108
That is where the frustration
was coming from.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.944
-Yeah.
-I'm so short. I don't even know…

39:24.028 --> 39:25.821
-What is this for?
-Huh?

39:25.905 --> 39:29.617
Uh, I'm smoothing it out, because then,
when you have the shape of the dolphin,

39:29.700 --> 39:32.411
then we can melt the curve,
and he'll fit perfectly.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.872
Watch your hand.
Coming with the knife.

39:34.955 --> 39:37.541
-That's fine.
-We need to get the body done.

39:42.463 --> 39:46.092
Having to sculpt, having to make detail,
is not something everyone really knows.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.386
As a pastry chef, as a chocolatier,

39:48.469 --> 39:51.889
I'm really the one
who really has it down to a nice science.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.476
I'm gonna put more lines,
but that's a good eye, right?

39:55.559 --> 39:56.394
Yeah.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.105
Clearly, chocolate
is what I'm well-versed in.

40:01.107 --> 40:07.446
Honestly, the first seven hours,
I didn't know what I did.

40:07.530 --> 40:11.617
Besides question my life.
I was like, "What am I doing?"

40:11.700 --> 40:13.953
It's tricky to do an elephant skin.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.747
When you do this, imagine your own skin.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.499
-When you… When you…
-Move. Right.

40:18.582 --> 40:22.670
When you move, right here,
that's where it's gonna be lined up, so…

40:22.753 --> 40:24.588
Yeah, this is like
the knuckle pointing out.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.216
So for the knuckle,
you're doing a very good job so far.

40:27.299 --> 40:28.884
-Yay! Finally.
-Yes.

40:30.302 --> 40:31.512
I got Charlie.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.055
I like Sprinkles, but…

40:33.139 --> 40:35.141
-Sprinkles? Sprinkle it is.
-Okay.

40:36.350 --> 40:40.146
I just hope
our dolphin doesn't become sushi.

40:41.981 --> 40:45.443
-Three and a half hours left to go, teams.
-Thank you, Chef.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.112
-We're gonna get it done.
-Yes, sir, we are.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.822
Help me position this, you guys.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.534
One, two, three. Okay, dear God.

40:58.539 --> 41:00.791
Tyricia, is it centered
from your perspective?

41:02.293 --> 41:03.627
Yes.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.303
Chefs, time to push, guys.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.180
I'm on garbage duty.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.265
Oh my God. They look so real.

41:16.348 --> 41:19.059
-Looks like trash.
-They look so real.

41:20.227 --> 41:21.687
I think we're good, right?

41:26.525 --> 41:29.403
-This is for the dolphin.
-That's for the dolphin color?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.780
Yeah. Do you like it?
It's silver and turquoise.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.241
Yeah, give me the colors
and I'll go with them.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.201
Slow, slow.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.912
-Coming through.
-Let's push, guys.

41:39.163 --> 41:42.082
There was no time.
So I literally spray the first time,

41:42.166 --> 41:44.960
flip it without even letting it set,
spray the next time.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.755
After pushing myself
for four hours to build the dolphin

41:47.838 --> 41:49.298
and not having the dolphin ready…

41:49.798 --> 41:51.342
I was not letting that happen.

41:51.425 --> 41:54.845
-Mellisa? Happy with the color?
-It looks green.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.474
Fifteen minutes, guys. Fifteen.

41:58.557 --> 42:00.142
-Fifteen.
-Thank you, Chef.

42:01.268 --> 42:03.395
-Can you move? Can you…
-Okay. We got one more.

42:03.479 --> 42:04.730
I can't believe we're here.

42:04.813 --> 42:06.357
-Keep polishing.
-Wait, Juan.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.359
-This isn't right.
-This isn't…

42:08.943 --> 42:10.236
-Is it right?
-Is it soft?

42:10.319 --> 42:11.570
-It's soft.
-Okay.

42:11.654 --> 42:14.114
We have limited time
to put the dolphin on the base.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.534
We were so nervous
of that dolphin falling.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.702
He's going off.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.538
-I got it.
-Pick it up, Juan.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.082
We didn't have enough time
for the chocolate to set.

42:23.165 --> 42:25.000
-There you go.
-Wanna spray it?

42:25.084 --> 42:26.877
-Take the wrap off.
-You okay?

42:26.961 --> 42:29.838
-Yeah, I'm okay. I'm holding it.
-It's too hard.

42:30.506 --> 42:33.342
-You guys, it's too hard.
-No, it's coming… Yeah.

42:33.425 --> 42:36.136
Just throwing blobs of chocolate on there

42:36.220 --> 42:38.639
that's not the right consistency
or right temperature

42:38.722 --> 42:40.432
is not gonna glue a dolphin.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.143
-It's too-- Yeah.
-I said it three times. It's too hard.

42:45.646 --> 42:48.482
-Three minutes left, chefs.
-<i>Oui, </i>three minutes.

42:50.818 --> 42:53.571
Hold on. Wait, Juan.
We're gonna cover this with plastic.

42:53.654 --> 42:54.738
Juan didn't have gloves on,

42:54.822 --> 42:57.866
and he'd gotten his chocolate handprints
all over this dolphin,

42:57.950 --> 43:00.869
and it was, like,
supposed to be our shiny object.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.914
-Ow, ow, ow, ow.
-One minute left.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.374
-Can you let go?
-No.

43:05.457 --> 43:08.752
I kept asking Juan, "Do you think
it's gonna hold?" He kept saying, "No."

43:08.836 --> 43:11.130
I'm like, "Can you let go of it at all?"
He's like, "No."

43:11.213 --> 43:12.423
Three,

43:12.506 --> 43:13.340
two,

43:13.424 --> 43:14.258
one.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.093
Daniel.

43:16.635 --> 43:17.970
Hands up, Juan.

43:21.348 --> 43:22.975
It's all right. It's okay.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.185
Congratulations, chefs.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.649
Oh my God,
we actually created,

43:30.733 --> 43:34.153
like, a 50-inch-tall structure,
and it looks so good.

43:34.737 --> 43:35.571
We did it.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.532
Oh!
