01:25.275 --> 01:26.710
<i>Hi, this is Sarah.</i>

01:26.742 --> 01:28.745
<i>Sorry, I can't
take your call right now.</i>

01:28.778 --> 01:31.114
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

01:32.281 --> 01:34.551
Hello, Sarah,
it's Isabella calling.

01:34.584 --> 01:37.387
Yeah, I'm outside our bakery,
waiting for you.

01:37.420 --> 01:39.222
So hurry up and get here, okay,

01:39.256 --> 01:41.625
'cause I'm freezing
my bloody arse off.

01:58.108 --> 02:00.745
OK,
everyone. Positions, please!

02:06.016 --> 02:07.251
<i>Hi, this is Sarah.</i>

02:09.019 --> 02:10.888
<i>Sarah, congratulations.</i>

02:10.919 --> 02:12.221
<i>Today's the day, right?</i>

02:12.254 --> 02:13.656
<i>Uh, you got the keys?</i>

02:13.689 --> 02:16.325
<i>It's gonna be
the best bakery ever.</i>

02:41.585 --> 02:43.653
"My dearest Sarah,

02:43.687 --> 02:46.856
I'm sorry we haven't spoken
for so long.

02:46.889 --> 02:50.593
I've been dreadfully stubborn
and for that I'm not proud."

02:58.801 --> 03:01.871
1, 2, down, nice.

03:01.905 --> 03:05.209
Hip up, shoulder bump.

03:05.241 --> 03:06.977
Down, 1, 2.

03:09.879 --> 03:13.483
Down, lift, up, and right, left,

03:13.515 --> 03:16.286
right, up, and cut,

03:16.318 --> 03:18.054
and step strong.

03:55.991 --> 03:57.393
Mimi Curachi?

03:57.426 --> 03:59.128
Yes.

04:27.958 --> 04:29.725
There's nothing I can do.

04:29.759 --> 04:32.028
But one of us is dead.

04:32.062 --> 04:33.896
But it's a joint lease,
you know that.

04:33.930 --> 04:35.465
You both signed the contract.

04:35.497 --> 04:37.334
But she was the chef.

04:38.535 --> 04:39.670
I'm not a chef.

04:39.702 --> 04:41.704
I mean, it's kind of
like opening up a zoo

04:41.737 --> 04:43.839
and saying, "Come on in,
but guess what,

04:43.872 --> 04:46.475
there's no animals."

04:46.509 --> 04:47.843
Well, can't you find a new one?

04:47.877 --> 04:49.579
Uh, someone as good as Sarah.

04:50.646 --> 04:52.214
Oh, she was famous.

04:52.247 --> 04:53.082
She trained with Ottolenghi!

04:53.115 --> 04:54.317
I don't know how it works.

04:54.350 --> 04:55.920
Huh!

05:00.790 --> 05:02.693
I'll tell you how it works.

05:02.725 --> 05:04.360
You sit there
all cheerily, smiling,

05:04.394 --> 05:05.528
"Look how big my balls are,"

05:05.562 --> 05:07.898
and then
my best friend is killed.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.366
My investors pull out,
because their star chef is dead,

05:10.399 --> 05:13.569
I'm losing all my savings
while the place sits empty,

05:13.603 --> 05:15.271
and now...
now that it's all gone tits up,

05:15.305 --> 05:17.206
you're sitting there
and you're telling me,

05:17.240 --> 05:18.709
"There's nothing I can do."

05:35.024 --> 05:38.361
Look, really, genuinely,
I am sorry for your loss.

05:38.394 --> 05:40.029
You signed
the agreement together

05:40.062 --> 05:42.699
and I will do my best...
my absolute best

05:42.732 --> 05:45.369
to try and re-let the place,
but you know yourself it...

05:45.401 --> 05:47.437
it was empty for a long time
and uh...

05:47.470 --> 05:50.407
I wish there was
something more I could say.

06:27.677 --> 06:30.047
Okay,
everyone, positions please.

06:46.528 --> 06:47.596
Nice and calm.

06:47.629 --> 06:51.767
Breathing on 5, 6, go 7.

06:51.800 --> 06:56.572
And you just say 1 and 2.

06:56.605 --> 06:57.706
Down 3.

06:57.740 --> 07:00.177
Open back full, nice.

07:00.209 --> 07:02.478
5 and 6.

07:02.512 --> 07:04.247
Round.

07:04.279 --> 07:05.714
Clarissa?

07:05.747 --> 07:10.519
And 1, 2, and 3.

07:10.552 --> 07:12.255
4.

07:13.822 --> 07:16.258
And 3, and 4.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.326
Clarissa?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
I'm sorry.

07:18.394 --> 07:19.629
- Hey, what's...
- I'm sorry.

07:19.661 --> 07:21.197
What's going on?

07:22.598 --> 07:23.834
Hey.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.652
<i>Playing first message</i>

08:15.685 --> 08:19.389
<i>left today at 4:16 p.m.</i>

08:20.456 --> 08:21.458
<i>Mimi?</i>

08:21.490 --> 08:24.627
<i>Hi, it's Olga here.</i>

08:24.661 --> 08:27.463
<i>Um, I hope you're okay.</i>

08:28.430 --> 08:32.501
<i>I... I just wondered if maybe you
fancied poker on Tuesday.</i>

08:32.534 --> 08:35.371
<i>Y... we...
we'd all love to see you.</i>

08:35.404 --> 08:38.274
<i>Um, anyway, let me know.</i>

08:38.307 --> 08:40.442
<i>Take care, bye.</i>

08:59.629 --> 09:01.865
Didn't hear from you all day.

09:01.898 --> 09:05.735
I was worried about you.

09:05.768 --> 09:10.706
Clarissa, are you gonna talk
to me at some point?

09:13.243 --> 09:17.647
Sometimes I wonder whether
I'm a boyfriend or a bedroom.

09:17.679 --> 09:19.014
I know
you're havin' a hard time.

09:19.048 --> 09:21.384
This isn't just about you,
it's about us.

09:25.321 --> 09:26.956
We're not happy anymore.

09:29.658 --> 09:32.528
Are you breakin' up with me?

09:35.831 --> 09:38.302
Oh my God,
you are breaking up with me.

09:40.769 --> 09:42.338
I'm sorry.

09:49.177 --> 09:51.814
I have nowhere to go.

10:18.573 --> 10:19.541
<i>Hi, Clarie.</i>

10:19.575 --> 10:21.811
<i>Just checking in.</i>

10:21.844 --> 10:23.879
<i>Yeah, I just... I wanted
to let you know</i>

10:23.913 --> 10:29.885
<i>I've finally have some interest
in the bakery.</i>

10:29.918 --> 10:32.721
<i>Nothing is confirmed yet,
but there is this guy</i>

10:32.754 --> 10:33.789
<i>who wants to...</i>

10:35.457 --> 10:38.160
<i>Huh, open up
a pop-up wine bar.</i>

10:38.193 --> 10:40.963
<i>Oh God, I know this is not
what Sarah would have wanted.</i>

10:40.996 --> 10:42.831
<i>I mean
it's not what I want either.</i>

10:42.865 --> 10:47.269
<i>Supposed to be a bakery,
our bakery.</i>

10:47.302 --> 10:48.304
<i>Sarah hated wine.</i>

10:48.337 --> 10:51.341
<i>She drank beer, anyway.</i>

10:51.374 --> 10:55.745
<i>But, I don't know I...</i>

10:55.778 --> 10:57.848
<i>I probably should agree to it.</i>

11:22.504 --> 11:23.907
Everything's fine.

11:23.940 --> 11:24.941
It doesn't look fine to me.

11:24.974 --> 11:26.609
Honestly, I promise.

11:26.642 --> 11:29.312
You know this girl?

11:29.345 --> 11:30.480
Yeah.

11:30.513 --> 11:34.451
Yeah, she's my... she's my niece.

11:34.484 --> 11:35.752
You don't know
if she's your niece.

11:35.784 --> 11:38.754
Well,
she's my best friend's daughter.

11:38.788 --> 11:41.390
And where's your friend?

11:41.423 --> 11:43.326
She died.

11:46.461 --> 11:48.831
Thank you.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.182
Get up, Larie.

12:06.215 --> 12:08.051
Come on.

12:22.365 --> 12:24.701
Hi, can I help you, madam?

12:24.734 --> 12:26.836
Uh, no, it's fine.

12:37.613 --> 12:39.549
- Mimi!
- Olga, hi.

12:39.581 --> 12:41.717
How are you, stranger?

12:41.750 --> 12:45.422
Well, you know, same old,
you know.

12:45.455 --> 12:48.124
Listen, uh, it's yoga at 4:00.

12:48.157 --> 12:49.325
Do you fancy it?

12:49.357 --> 12:51.427
It'd be great to see you.

12:51.461 --> 12:53.028
Well, no, I...

12:53.062 --> 12:54.197
I don't think so.

12:54.230 --> 12:56.466
It's been so long
and I'm completely out of shape.

12:56.499 --> 12:58.701
Rubbish, look at you.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.370
4:00, okay?

13:01.403 --> 13:05.274
And then we'll go for coffee
after, like old times.

13:05.307 --> 13:06.375
I'll see you at 4:00.

13:06.408 --> 13:08.711
Okay.

13:21.724 --> 13:24.461
So you wanna tell me
what's going on?

13:24.494 --> 13:25.562
Has something happened
with Alex?

13:25.595 --> 13:27.330
I thought you guys were
living together.

13:29.130 --> 13:33.035
It wasn't workin' out.

13:33.068 --> 13:35.070
I suppose you could stay
at mine.

13:35.104 --> 13:37.006
There's no space.

13:37.038 --> 13:38.841
There's a sofa.
I mean, I know it's not ideal.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.476
Honestly, it is totally fine.

13:40.509 --> 13:42.412
Well, it's obviously not, is it?

13:45.447 --> 13:46.917
What the hell are you gonna do?

13:50.785 --> 13:53.956
There is somebody
I could still try.

14:00.529 --> 14:02.499
<i>There she is again.</i>

14:02.532 --> 14:05.201
<i>Magical Mimi Curachi.</i>

14:05.234 --> 14:08.771
<i>Celebrating 12 years
on the trapeze today.</i>

14:08.803 --> 14:11.073
<i>With this surprise show,</i>

14:11.106 --> 14:14.009
<i>she is proving
to her fans once again...</i>

14:14.043 --> 14:17.214
<i>What an incomparable star
she is.</i>

14:34.563 --> 14:36.031
Sure you're gonna be okay?

14:36.065 --> 14:37.234
Mmhmm.

14:41.504 --> 14:44.072
- Will you come in?
- No.

14:46.174 --> 14:49.612
I haven't seen Mimi
in a long time.

15:10.966 --> 15:12.568
Milk?

15:12.601 --> 15:15.538
Do you have any soy milk?

15:18.607 --> 15:19.975
That's fine.

15:32.654 --> 15:36.793
I'm sorry, I haven't visited.

15:36.826 --> 15:41.497
I did intend to, but, um...

15:41.529 --> 15:43.732
...I just think living
in London,

15:43.765 --> 15:46.602
time goes by and the things
that you meant to do

15:46.635 --> 15:49.805
like the coffees,
and the visits, and everything,

15:49.839 --> 15:51.374
you just...
you look at your diary

15:51.407 --> 15:53.442
and suddenly it's October and...

15:53.475 --> 15:55.144
Yeah.

16:01.049 --> 16:02.250
Are you going to tell me
the reason

16:02.283 --> 16:03.519
for this visit, Clarissa

16:03.552 --> 16:05.221
or are we going to have
to battle our way

16:05.254 --> 16:07.023
through this small talk?

16:09.825 --> 16:12.862
Can't um, a granddaughter
visit a grandma?

16:12.894 --> 16:15.063
Yes, a granddaughter can.

16:15.096 --> 16:16.732
Pity she hasn't.

16:19.368 --> 16:20.470
Oh God, that is very hot.

16:20.503 --> 16:22.572
How much do you want?

16:22.605 --> 16:24.173
What?

16:24.206 --> 16:26.375
How much?

16:27.743 --> 16:28.811
Do you really think this is
about money?

16:28.844 --> 16:30.647
Look, I haven't seen you

16:30.679 --> 16:31.947
for God knows how long.

16:31.980 --> 16:33.750
You come in here unannounced.

16:33.783 --> 16:35.784
Of course it's about money.

16:35.817 --> 16:38.687
I need a place to stay.

16:42.692 --> 16:47.330
Oh well, that's different.

17:05.714 --> 17:07.116
So heavy.

17:09.416 --> 17:10.519
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

17:10.553 --> 17:11.587
Thanks for your help.

17:11.618 --> 17:13.122
Bye-bye.

17:15.423 --> 17:16.425
Hi.

17:16.459 --> 17:19.461
Hi.

17:21.096 --> 17:22.565
Ow!

17:22.597 --> 17:23.598
- Careful, that...
- Oh, sorry.

17:23.632 --> 17:24.599
Ow, Jesus!

17:24.633 --> 17:26.635
Why is that right
in the doorway?

17:26.669 --> 17:27.804
I wasn't expecting you
to have...

17:27.836 --> 17:29.571
Really quite cramped
around here.

17:29.605 --> 17:32.842
Yes, I didn't expect you
to have quite so...

17:32.875 --> 17:33.809
So much.

17:35.644 --> 17:37.579
Okay, this is it.

17:37.613 --> 17:39.048
Uh...

17:39.080 --> 17:40.349
It's fine.

17:41.450 --> 17:43.086
Okay.

17:43.118 --> 17:44.319
- Careful.
- Oh, sorry!

17:44.353 --> 17:45.755
Ow, Jes...

17:51.227 --> 17:54.330
Oh, for heaven...

17:58.000 --> 18:00.635
Turn down that fuckin' music!

18:12.248 --> 18:13.649
Did you sleep well?

18:13.682 --> 18:15.951
Yeah, thanks.

18:20.588 --> 18:22.258
Um, I'm going for a run.

18:24.259 --> 18:26.695
There's a key on the side.

18:32.734 --> 18:35.070
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

19:34.462 --> 19:36.632
<i>I'm outside
our bakery, waiting for you.</i>

19:36.664 --> 19:37.799
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

19:37.833 --> 19:38.835
<i>It's not what
Sarah wanted.</i>

19:38.867 --> 19:40.336
<i>But one of us is dead.</i>

19:40.368 --> 19:43.238
...these stock
auctions, the quarter 4, 2018,

19:43.271 --> 19:46.708
there is a clear parallel
in the figures from quarter 1

19:46.741 --> 19:48.411
to quarter f...

19:49.944 --> 19:54.049
4 of 2018.

19:54.083 --> 19:57.687
And what we need to do is
capitalize on that growth and...

19:57.720 --> 19:59.922
Hello, I'm so sorry.

19:59.954 --> 20:02.224
Isabella, could I just talk
to you for a minute?

20:02.258 --> 20:04.160
I'm really sorry, I won't
take her from the meeting

20:04.192 --> 20:05.694
for very long on this...
on this one.

20:05.728 --> 20:07.395
Excuse me, sorry.

20:07.429 --> 20:09.165
Excuse me.

20:09.198 --> 20:10.266
Thanks.

20:13.903 --> 20:15.738
Do you know how hard
it was to get this job back?

20:15.770 --> 20:16.771
Yes, I know, but...

20:16.805 --> 20:19.307
I had to beg.
I'm 39 years old.

20:19.340 --> 20:20.775
Do you know how that feels?

20:20.808 --> 20:22.644
- Don't do it.
- What?

20:22.678 --> 20:23.846
The wine bar.

20:23.878 --> 20:25.146
Let's open the bakery.

20:27.282 --> 20:28.450
What are you talking about?

20:28.483 --> 20:30.418
You and me, think about it.

20:30.451 --> 20:32.387
Yeah, 'cause it's that simple.

20:32.421 --> 20:34.190
But yeah, of course, it is.

20:36.724 --> 20:39.661
Okay, so...

20:39.694 --> 20:42.163
...this is
where we're at financially.

20:42.196 --> 20:44.933
- Is that pounds?
- Yeah, but that's nothing.

20:44.967 --> 20:49.972
I mean, there's costs, set up,
insurance, materials.

20:50.005 --> 20:52.208
The only way of making
any money on this place

20:52.240 --> 20:54.743
is by actually selling food.

20:54.777 --> 20:56.511
Without a baker...

20:56.545 --> 21:00.783
Somebody as good as Sarah,
we're nowhere.

21:00.816 --> 21:02.884
- Larie.
- Yes.

21:02.917 --> 21:05.687
- You getting this?
- Um, yeah, uh, sort of.

21:05.721 --> 21:07.722
I need to know
that you understand

21:07.756 --> 21:09.859
the full scale
of the thing, you know?

21:09.892 --> 21:11.559
Mmhmm.

21:11.593 --> 21:13.329
Oh my God,
this isn't gonna work.

21:13.362 --> 21:16.032
This is not gonna work.

21:20.336 --> 21:21.904
I can get the money.

21:29.545 --> 21:31.413
Please just tell me
where we're going.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.049
You're gonna find out soon
and trust me.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.451
- You're going to enjoy it.
- I won't.

21:35.483 --> 21:36.451
- Oh my God.
- I won't.

21:36.484 --> 21:37.519
Okay.

21:37.553 --> 21:38.554
I didn't want
to come out anyway.

21:38.586 --> 21:40.623
Should we leave it?

21:40.655 --> 21:42.857
Hello, everybody,
welcome to Flying Fantastic.

21:42.891 --> 21:45.528
My name is Jen,
I'll be your instructor today.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.429
For those of you I haven't met
uh,

21:47.462 --> 21:50.132
this is
an intermediate-level class,

21:50.164 --> 21:53.903
so I'm assuming you all have
a little bit of prior know-how.

21:53.935 --> 21:54.903
Yes.

21:54.936 --> 21:56.871
Great, let's get started.

22:02.845 --> 22:05.181
This is ridiculous.

22:05.213 --> 22:06.715
This was your life.

22:06.749 --> 22:08.483
A long time ago.

22:08.517 --> 22:10.152
- I'm past it.
- Sshh!

22:10.184 --> 22:13.923
Rubbish, you're in the prime
of your life.

22:13.955 --> 22:15.090
Hardly.

22:15.124 --> 22:17.259
So long as you've
got your incontinence pads on.

22:26.335 --> 22:29.171
Very strong.

22:29.203 --> 22:31.673
That's... that's really nice.
Okay, so bring the hand...

22:31.707 --> 22:33.642
Yes, I know what I'm doing,
actually. Thank you.

22:43.285 --> 22:44.420
Yeah, that's it.

22:44.452 --> 22:47.088
So if you just sit to the side
and this will... lay back.

22:47.122 --> 22:48.157
- That's it.
- No!

22:48.190 --> 22:48.990
- Good, so...
- No!

22:49.023 --> 22:50.859
- Re...
- She's got the wrong arm up!

22:50.893 --> 22:52.228
- And her bum's sticking out.
- Okay, just reach...

22:52.260 --> 22:53.596
- Wait.
- Excuse me, sorry...

22:53.628 --> 22:56.398
Yes, but...
look, tuck your bum in,

22:56.432 --> 22:58.634
change arms.

22:58.666 --> 23:01.302
There. You see?
Like that.

23:01.336 --> 23:02.605
Just like that.

23:02.637 --> 23:04.072
I can't believe you, Mimi.

23:04.105 --> 23:05.106
Hmm, what?

23:06.240 --> 23:08.009
The look on their faces.

23:08.042 --> 23:09.811
Oh dear,
I hope I wasn't too rude.

23:09.845 --> 23:13.315
Yeah, you definitely were.

23:13.347 --> 23:14.916
Oh, my thighs.

23:14.950 --> 23:17.119
I'm not gonna be able to walk
for a week!

23:17.152 --> 23:19.587
Well, you look like
you haven't forgotten a thing.

23:19.621 --> 23:23.125
Maybe you should look
at getting back into it.

23:23.157 --> 23:24.492
Thank you.

23:24.526 --> 23:27.229
Maybe I will.

23:27.261 --> 23:28.931
When I looked across at you,

23:28.963 --> 23:30.799
you are going back
to your company, aren't you?

23:34.803 --> 23:38.174
We're gonna open the bakery,
me and Isabella.

23:42.544 --> 23:45.848
We need some financial help.

23:46.714 --> 23:48.483
Yes, I wondered.

23:48.517 --> 23:50.385
- What?
- What a shame.

23:50.419 --> 23:52.555
I thought you and I had some...

23:52.587 --> 23:54.824
Ugh!

23:54.856 --> 23:57.657
Take her to a trapeze class,
butter her up,

23:57.659 --> 23:59.929
- I'm not stupid, Clarissa.
- What?

23:59.961 --> 24:01.963
Mum's gone now and the... oh,
there were just

24:01.997 --> 24:04.166
so many wasted years
between you two.

24:04.199 --> 24:06.769
And the least you could do
is come and have a look.

24:12.641 --> 24:14.410
- Uh.
- Good morning.

24:14.442 --> 24:15.978
Hey.

24:17.945 --> 24:18.947
Mimi.

24:18.980 --> 24:20.715
Isabella.

24:20.749 --> 24:22.250
You look well.

24:35.364 --> 24:36.598
This?

24:36.632 --> 24:38.234
You want money for this?

24:38.267 --> 24:40.836
Okay, so it does look
a bit rough at the moment,

24:40.868 --> 24:42.904
but you can definitely see
its potential.

24:42.938 --> 24:45.708
What?
As a crack den?

24:45.740 --> 24:48.109
Okay, ladies,
picture this, right?

24:48.143 --> 24:50.913
A big table, and a bar,

24:50.945 --> 24:53.581
and then
big industrial coffee machine,

24:53.615 --> 24:55.984
and "Oh, what's that smell?"

24:56.018 --> 24:57.385
Cat's piss.

24:57.419 --> 24:58.653
No, it's not cat's piss.

24:58.686 --> 25:01.156
Croissants, fresh from the oven.

25:01.190 --> 25:03.359
Yes, but what do you
two girls really know

25:03.392 --> 25:04.860
about opening a bakery?

25:04.893 --> 25:06.562
I'm sorry,
did you just call us "girls"?

25:06.595 --> 25:07.630
This is what she does.

25:07.663 --> 25:09.597
It's what she always does.

25:09.631 --> 25:11.867
What about your circus, okay?

25:11.900 --> 25:13.869
You started that from scratch.

25:13.902 --> 25:16.404
If anyone knows
how to steer a ship, it's you.

25:16.438 --> 25:18.541
I'm not falling for that.

25:18.574 --> 25:21.677
Look, are you in or out?

25:22.911 --> 25:25.214
Okay, ladies,
if we are going to do this,

25:25.247 --> 25:27.550
we are going to have
to get along, okay?

25:27.583 --> 25:29.518
Mum would have wanted us
to open this bakery,

25:29.550 --> 25:32.053
so that is
what we're going to do.

25:32.086 --> 25:33.855
Together.

25:59.914 --> 26:01.317
<i>Hello.</i>

26:01.349 --> 26:04.086
Isabella?

26:04.118 --> 26:07.055
<i>Mimi.</i>

26:07.088 --> 26:10.393
Well, you're gonna let me in
or what?

26:16.897 --> 26:18.000
Oh.

26:29.344 --> 26:30.947
I should have called.

26:34.715 --> 26:36.584
It... it's just that I was...

26:36.617 --> 26:39.955
I was so nearby, I thought...

26:50.598 --> 26:52.634
You know...

26:52.667 --> 26:54.971
Clarissa is
just like her mother.

26:57.071 --> 27:00.808
And Sarah was just like hers.

27:00.842 --> 27:03.211
What?
You mean stubborn?

27:14.955 --> 27:17.859
I know I let you
and Sarah down before.

27:25.232 --> 27:28.436
But she wouldn't
have wanted this, would she?

27:28.470 --> 27:29.471
Me?

27:33.808 --> 27:36.912
That's all she ever wanted.

28:02.938 --> 28:04.173
I'm gonna clear this,

28:04.205 --> 28:06.074
because uh, I just want
to have the floor here.

28:06.107 --> 28:07.710
You can put
that in the back...

28:07.742 --> 28:09.510
- Everything... yeah...
- Yeah.

28:09.544 --> 28:10.979
Let the dog see the rabbit
as they say.

28:11.011 --> 28:12.614
- Yeah, exactly.
- I'm good.

28:12.646 --> 28:14.883
- To the back. More of a mess.
- I know.

28:14.915 --> 28:16.585
I want to get
the floor clear.

28:16.617 --> 28:18.886
No, it does need paint.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.255
- Can we just clear this?
- Yes.

28:20.288 --> 28:23.459
- Right out of the way.
- To the back.

28:37.405 --> 28:38.374
You're...

28:38.406 --> 28:39.407
So I was the head chef

28:39.441 --> 28:40.709
over at St. Mary's School
for Girls.

28:40.741 --> 28:42.009
You know, nothing fancy.

28:42.042 --> 28:43.878
Jam roly-polys,
that sort of thing.

28:43.912 --> 28:45.047
Not that the girls
really cared much.

28:45.079 --> 28:46.781
They just vommed it all up
in the toilets.

28:46.815 --> 28:49.184
Yeah.

28:51.019 --> 28:54.189
Just put it up in
position, 'cause I can't tell.

28:57.192 --> 29:01.697
So long as I'm home by 6:00.
I cannot break my curfew.

29:05.767 --> 29:09.238
My starting salary is 45,000
with 35 days' leave.

29:09.270 --> 29:12.173
Obviously,
not including public holidays.

29:12.207 --> 29:15.177
And I don't work nights
or weekends.

29:29.490 --> 29:31.593
I'm here about the baking job.

29:32.624 --> 29:33.895
- Is it still available?
- Get out, Matthew.

29:33.929 --> 29:35.798
Warm welcome.

29:35.830 --> 29:37.031
The position's been filled.

29:37.065 --> 29:39.000
Really?

29:40.234 --> 29:42.170
You sure?

29:42.203 --> 29:43.672
Thank you.

29:43.704 --> 29:45.339
Leave the way you came.

29:46.474 --> 29:47.976
Look.

29:49.944 --> 29:51.579
I'm serious.

29:51.613 --> 29:54.316
Is someone going to explain?

29:54.348 --> 29:56.284
You must be Clarissa.

29:56.317 --> 29:57.653
Hi.

29:57.685 --> 29:59.754
This is Matthew Gregory.
We trained together.

29:59.788 --> 30:01.190
I was a friend of your mum's.

30:01.222 --> 30:02.557
Oh, uh, you're a chef.

30:02.590 --> 30:03.858
I am, Michelin-starred.

30:03.892 --> 30:05.494
You're not Michelin-starred,
your restaurant is,

30:05.527 --> 30:08.764
and you weren't her friend,
just a pretentious womanizer.

30:08.797 --> 30:10.598
Well, I'm not one to boast,

30:10.632 --> 30:11.667
it's actually
two-Michelin starred.

30:13.101 --> 30:15.537
- Aren't you at Trois Amis?
- Yeah.

30:15.569 --> 30:16.838
Why would you wanna leave?

30:16.872 --> 30:19.875
Well, you know,
I fancy a challenge.

30:19.907 --> 30:21.576
Then climb Kilimanjaro maybe,

30:21.609 --> 30:23.411
I don't know, take up crochet.

30:23.444 --> 30:24.812
Alright, look, I'm after...

30:26.914 --> 30:29.684
A bit more creative control.

30:29.718 --> 30:32.688
Alright,
so you wanna come here, why?

30:32.721 --> 30:34.690
The stuff that you make,
it's not really in our range.

30:34.722 --> 30:37.659
I can make anything!

30:42.196 --> 30:45.700
Listen, he and Sarah
had proper history.

30:45.733 --> 30:47.502
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

30:47.536 --> 30:48.769
Oh, don't be daft.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.906
You can't turn down a chef
with a Michelin star.

30:50.939 --> 30:52.074
Two Michelin stars.

30:52.106 --> 30:53.575
We want this to be
a success, don't we?

30:53.607 --> 30:55.977
Let's go for the best.

31:09.457 --> 31:11.193
Presenting Ispahan.

31:11.226 --> 31:13.662
Bless you.

31:13.694 --> 31:16.564
It's a rose macaron
filled with rose petal

31:16.597 --> 31:19.000
and lychee crémière
and fresh raspberries.

31:19.034 --> 31:20.135
Hmm.

31:23.637 --> 31:25.273
I wanna try it.

31:35.182 --> 31:37.184
The batter's undermixed.

31:37.218 --> 31:38.620
Sorry?

31:38.653 --> 31:41.690
Not by much, but it could do
with a few more folds.

31:47.095 --> 31:48.430
Okay, yeah, do you...
do you need me

31:48.462 --> 31:49.798
to be here for that?

31:49.830 --> 31:51.032
Somebody will be here.

31:51.066 --> 31:52.167
Okay.

32:14.088 --> 32:15.691
Orange wellhorn,
a chocolate mousse

32:15.723 --> 32:17.525
sitting on a crunchy
chocolate samblé,

32:17.558 --> 32:19.360
finished
with a mirrored chocolate glaze

32:19.394 --> 32:20.929
and crunchy chocolate pearls.

32:20.961 --> 32:23.198
Is there a simpler way
of saying that?

32:23.230 --> 32:24.566
Mousse on a biscuit.

32:27.434 --> 32:29.303
Mousse on a biscuit.

32:36.411 --> 32:38.180
Mmm.

32:38.212 --> 32:39.748
Hmm.

32:45.653 --> 32:49.357
Tastes really good.

32:49.391 --> 32:50.692
When can you start?

33:00.769 --> 33:03.072
Excuse me,
can you just pull over here?

33:08.910 --> 33:10.045
Hey.

33:12.212 --> 33:13.749
What are you up to?

33:15.683 --> 33:17.952
I think we need a drink,
don't you?

33:24.692 --> 33:26.662
Thank you.

33:26.694 --> 33:28.864
Thank you.

33:40.575 --> 33:42.177
- I don't do shots anymore.
- Neither do I.

33:42.210 --> 33:44.379
Come on.

33:44.412 --> 33:46.480
Let's celebrate
like the old days.

33:46.513 --> 33:49.116
3, 2, 1.

33:49.150 --> 33:50.219
Mmm.

34:00.228 --> 34:01.697
Clarissa?

34:01.730 --> 34:03.865
Do you want some supper?

34:03.897 --> 34:07.001
I'm all good.

34:34.496 --> 34:36.764
Bake with me.

34:36.797 --> 34:39.199
You're right, I'm not Sarah.

34:39.233 --> 34:41.103
Your passion for this project,
that's what we need.

34:41.135 --> 34:42.471
Put that in the kitchen.

34:42.503 --> 34:44.639
- Except I'm not a baker.
- Yes, you are.

34:44.672 --> 34:46.407
- We trained together.
- Yeah, years ago.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.909
- So?
- So...

34:50.478 --> 34:52.447
I'm not as good as her, alright?

34:52.480 --> 34:56.184
- I never was.
- Rubbish.

34:56.217 --> 34:58.586
You were her best friend.

34:58.619 --> 34:59.887
You were practically sisters.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.590
If anyone can put her spirit
into this, it's you.

35:02.623 --> 35:04.291
Ugh.

35:04.324 --> 35:05.693
Sarah was special, okay?

35:05.726 --> 35:07.795
She... she was talented,
she was the baker,

35:07.829 --> 35:10.733
I just run things. I...

35:12.300 --> 35:14.068
You can do it.

35:16.103 --> 35:18.639
I need to pee.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.494
So that's the light bulb.

35:40.527 --> 35:42.496
Mmhmm, thank you.

35:42.530 --> 35:43.598
Black coffee still?

35:43.630 --> 35:45.000
- Of course.
- Okay.

35:45.032 --> 35:46.101
Thank you.

35:47.768 --> 35:50.738
There was a time in about 1985

35:50.771 --> 35:52.340
and I'd just come back
from Peru,

35:52.373 --> 35:54.342
and you and Sarah are desperate
to try the coffee

35:54.375 --> 35:55.677
I brought back.

35:55.710 --> 35:57.179
And you didn't sleep
for two days.

35:57.211 --> 35:58.213
Do you remember?

35:58.246 --> 35:59.782
Yeah, I do you remember that.

36:01.315 --> 36:04.451
You always wished
you were sisters, didn't you?

36:04.485 --> 36:05.487
Mmhmm.

36:05.519 --> 36:08.722
Absolutely inseparable.

36:08.755 --> 36:10.792
I was very proud of you.

36:12.427 --> 36:14.096
Both of you.

36:22.170 --> 36:23.238
Mimi.

36:25.806 --> 36:27.675
I've really missed you.

36:41.623 --> 36:42.990
What do you think?

36:49.931 --> 36:51.766
Mimi?

36:56.403 --> 36:59.039
Hmm.

36:59.072 --> 37:01.809
Sarah.

37:03.443 --> 37:04.980
Love Sarah.

37:57.164 --> 37:58.365
Make way!

37:58.398 --> 37:59.833
Golden coffee bean eclairs.

37:59.867 --> 38:01.169
Not bad, bakery boy.

38:01.202 --> 38:03.371
Thank you.

38:03.403 --> 38:04.539
Um, excuse me.

38:04.572 --> 38:06.007
- Who's left this here?
- Not me.

38:06.039 --> 38:07.074
Matthew, please don't leave it...

38:07.108 --> 38:08.143
- Mimi.
- In the window.

38:08.175 --> 38:09.543
- It wasn't me.
- It looks awful.

38:09.577 --> 38:10.779
- I just wanted...
- Somebody did.

38:10.811 --> 38:12.480
- Put that in the kitchen.
- I'm not doing it.

38:12.512 --> 38:15.282
So the contactless,
you just can't use that.

38:15.315 --> 38:16.917
When they're using cash...

38:16.951 --> 38:18.786
I know, but I don't understand
how the machine works.

38:18.820 --> 38:19.921
- You just need to...
- Just write it all down.

38:19.954 --> 38:21.389
- Write it all down.
- Write it all down.

38:21.422 --> 38:23.692
Oh.

38:25.460 --> 38:26.461
- Whoa!
- Sorry, Matthew!

38:26.494 --> 38:27.495
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.135
Uh, do we need these?

38:34.168 --> 38:37.472
Probably.

38:37.505 --> 38:38.840
You see this goes there.

38:38.873 --> 38:41.409
Oh, I like them actually.

38:41.442 --> 38:44.112
So I'm having these.

39:02.697 --> 39:04.399
Here we go.

39:24.184 --> 39:25.286
Wow, crowds!

39:27.588 --> 39:29.024
They'll come.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.929
They'll come.

39:37.097 --> 39:38.166
Oh dear.

39:54.949 --> 39:57.719
Hi, welcome to Love Sarah's.

39:57.751 --> 39:59.621
Hi!

39:59.653 --> 40:01.623
- Have you just opened?
- Mmhmm.

40:01.655 --> 40:03.424
Yeah, it's our first day.

40:03.458 --> 40:06.628
50% off of everything.

40:06.661 --> 40:08.896
- Hello.
- Nice!

40:11.264 --> 40:13.600
What would you like now?

40:13.634 --> 40:15.702
Pastéis de nata.

40:15.735 --> 40:17.271
What's he saying?

40:17.304 --> 40:19.873
Oh, he's just wants a cake
that we have back home.

40:19.907 --> 40:22.710
- Where is it?
- Lisbon.

40:22.742 --> 40:25.145
Hmm, I'll tell you what.

40:25.179 --> 40:28.215
Hmm, would you have
one of these maybe?

40:33.221 --> 40:34.021
Purple?

40:34.054 --> 40:35.690
Yeah, perfect.

40:37.324 --> 40:38.158
Would you like a coffee?

40:38.193 --> 40:40.629
Oh yes, please, a latté.

40:43.597 --> 40:45.400
I'll get you a plate.

40:49.003 --> 40:52.841
Two people and it's lunchtime.

40:52.873 --> 40:55.409
Relax, it's our first day.

40:55.443 --> 40:57.312
No one knows about us yet.

40:57.344 --> 40:58.879
Exactly.

41:00.213 --> 41:01.949
Oh, hello, yes.

41:01.983 --> 41:04.552
I was wondering if I could speak
to your food editor, please?

41:04.585 --> 41:07.989
Hi, could I speak to a...
uh, Naomi Parker, please?

41:08.021 --> 41:10.657
Yes, it's Isabella.
I'm calling from Love Sarah.

41:10.690 --> 41:12.359
Oh, she's left, okay.

41:12.393 --> 41:13.494
We're a new bakery,
Golborne Road.

41:13.527 --> 41:15.362
Do you know where she's gone?

41:17.164 --> 41:20.335
Hello?

41:20.367 --> 41:23.403
Hello?

41:23.436 --> 41:25.572
Again.

41:25.606 --> 41:27.709
No, I'll just write it down.

41:29.744 --> 41:31.546
- Oh!
- Good morning.

41:31.579 --> 41:34.048
It's our friendly
neighbourhood watch.

41:34.081 --> 41:36.617
I see you spying.

41:38.920 --> 41:39.721
Here.

41:39.753 --> 41:41.054
It's our soft opening.

41:41.088 --> 41:42.457
On the house.

41:42.489 --> 41:47.427
There are four other bakers
within five minutes' walk.

41:47.460 --> 41:49.963
What makes you so special?

41:49.996 --> 41:52.134
Why don't you try one
and tell me?

41:58.905 --> 42:00.974
I'm Mimi, by the way.

42:01.007 --> 42:03.744
Felix Rosenbaum.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.483
You the proprietor?

42:08.516 --> 42:09.784
- We all are.
- Mmhmm.

42:09.817 --> 42:11.853
Well, you wanna be careful
around here.

42:11.885 --> 42:14.489
You know, intruders, burglars.

42:14.521 --> 42:15.623
As fate would have it,

42:15.655 --> 42:18.125
I've just finalized
my latest invention,

42:18.159 --> 42:22.163
the most advanced
infrared security system

42:22.195 --> 42:24.565
of the 21st century.

42:24.599 --> 42:27.235
How fascinating.

42:29.070 --> 42:33.208
So good luck.

42:34.641 --> 42:36.277
Thanks for dropping by.

42:44.952 --> 42:46.487
Simon.

42:46.519 --> 42:50.458
To what do I owe this pleasure?

42:50.490 --> 42:52.759
I'm just popping out.

42:52.793 --> 42:55.063
Hey, we're still open.

42:55.096 --> 42:56.597
We're dead anyway.
Give him a break.

42:56.630 --> 42:58.532
Yeah, Isabella, give me a break.

42:58.565 --> 43:00.400
Can you, um...

43:00.434 --> 43:01.769
Thanks.

43:06.740 --> 43:07.942
He's only messing.

43:07.974 --> 43:09.409
- Yeah, right.
- Come on.

43:09.443 --> 43:10.812
It's fine, he's hilarious.

43:10.844 --> 43:11.878
Jesus.

43:11.911 --> 43:13.914
- What, are you jealous?
- Oh, please.

43:13.947 --> 43:15.182
Alright, well,
you don't need to be.

43:15.215 --> 43:17.585
You know, 'cause it's not
like I'm gonna sleep

43:17.617 --> 43:19.721
with my dad anyway.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.923
What?

43:22.956 --> 43:25.460
Matthew is not your father,
okay?

43:25.492 --> 43:26.561
He's not.

43:26.594 --> 43:28.829
Okay, well,
then who else would it be?

43:28.862 --> 43:30.397
That I can't tell you.

43:30.431 --> 43:31.432
Why?

43:31.465 --> 43:34.736
Because she always said

43:34.768 --> 43:35.936
she never knew his name.

43:35.969 --> 43:37.704
Oh, come on, that's bullshit.

43:37.737 --> 43:40.073
Clarissa,
he's not, okay? He can't be.

43:40.106 --> 43:41.742
I'm sorry, were you there
at the conception?

43:41.775 --> 43:43.478
Sarah never lied, did she?

43:43.510 --> 43:45.346
To anybody.
Certainly not to me!

43:45.378 --> 43:49.317
I mean, if... ugh, if he was
then... then I would know.

43:50.418 --> 43:52.186
Well, then why is he here?

43:54.487 --> 43:55.756
I don't know.

44:02.829 --> 44:04.032
I am flattered.

44:04.065 --> 44:05.300
I am, honestly.

44:07.635 --> 44:08.636
Okay.

44:08.668 --> 44:10.304
Y... look, I can't.

44:10.338 --> 44:11.339
Not yet.

44:11.371 --> 44:13.674
I'm... just...

44:13.708 --> 44:17.177
Give me a couple more weeks.

44:18.478 --> 44:20.014
Alright, thanks.

44:22.550 --> 44:24.252
Yeah, bye.

44:50.510 --> 44:52.547
Morning.

44:52.579 --> 44:53.614
You're late.

44:53.646 --> 44:54.915
Relax, it's the weekend.

44:54.949 --> 44:56.351
We've got work to do.

44:56.384 --> 44:57.818
Have you got me a bonnet
as well?

44:57.851 --> 44:59.119
You're hilarious.

45:00.487 --> 45:02.422
Where's Clarissa?

45:02.456 --> 45:04.592
Why?

45:04.625 --> 45:06.360
No reason, I'm just wondering
where Clarissa is.

45:12.599 --> 45:13.701
This one is you.

45:13.733 --> 45:15.436
- Thank you, cheers.
- It's okay.

45:15.469 --> 45:17.105
- Hello.
- Hey, Matthew!

45:20.940 --> 45:24.111
Mmm.

45:25.179 --> 45:27.048
Do you remember
the first time you met mum?

45:27.081 --> 45:28.048
Of course, I do.

45:28.081 --> 45:30.717
It was our first lesson
in Paris.

45:30.751 --> 45:32.186
What was she like back then?

45:33.320 --> 45:35.123
- Scary.
- Hmm.

45:35.155 --> 45:37.991
Intimidating.

45:38.025 --> 45:40.827
Beautiful.

45:40.860 --> 45:45.298
So what actually happened
with you guys?

45:45.331 --> 45:47.034
I messed up.

45:47.067 --> 45:52.139
I was, you know,
young, irresponsible.

45:52.172 --> 45:53.640
Did you love her?

45:53.673 --> 45:55.208
Oh, pomegranates.

45:55.242 --> 45:56.377
Did you?

45:57.510 --> 45:59.246
Everyone loves everyone
when they're 19.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.281
Yeah.

46:00.313 --> 46:01.750
Oh, raspberries.

46:03.117 --> 46:07.221
So why did you come
to our bakery?

46:07.253 --> 46:10.290
It's a difficult question.

46:16.030 --> 46:19.867
I don't know,
I suppose unfinished business.

46:19.900 --> 46:21.302
Mmhmm.

46:22.670 --> 46:25.539
When I heard
about what happened to your mum.

46:25.572 --> 46:30.777
I felt terrible,
like I should have...

46:30.811 --> 46:33.414
I should have got in touch.

46:33.447 --> 46:36.117
Made amends.

46:36.150 --> 46:37.218
Hmm.

46:37.251 --> 46:38.753
Thank you.

46:42.188 --> 46:43.190
Hmm.

46:43.224 --> 46:44.425
Ow!
What was that?

46:44.458 --> 46:46.093
Sor...
it's nothing, you had a...

46:46.126 --> 46:48.729
You just...
you had a thing on you.

46:48.762 --> 46:50.565
- A thing.
- Ow.

46:50.597 --> 46:51.932
That was weird.

46:58.005 --> 46:59.874
What?

47:31.672 --> 47:32.706
Okay.

47:32.739 --> 47:36.243
So £83, 55p.

47:36.277 --> 47:37.311
Which makes...

47:39.380 --> 47:42.884
£658.

47:44.818 --> 47:47.522
Oh Lord, is that it?

47:47.554 --> 47:49.656
It was only our first week.

47:49.690 --> 47:51.759
But it doesn't
even pay our rent!

47:51.791 --> 47:54.161
It takes time, Mimi, doesn't it?

47:54.193 --> 47:57.731
Oh, we should be jammed
in our first week.

47:57.764 --> 47:59.666
People are always excited
about a new place opening,

47:59.699 --> 48:01.034
but we're empty.

48:01.068 --> 48:03.871
It was just our
first week, everything's fine.

48:03.903 --> 48:06.173
Everything is not fine,
Clarissa.

48:08.675 --> 48:10.177
Mimi Curachi?

48:10.210 --> 48:11.445
Yes, that's me.

48:11.478 --> 48:13.213
Enjoy.

48:13.246 --> 48:15.081
Hmm.

48:15.114 --> 48:16.550
Thank you.

48:16.583 --> 48:19.419
Who's buying you flowers?

48:19.452 --> 48:20.954
Mind your own business.

48:24.692 --> 48:27.862
Hello. I brought you
a little something.

48:27.894 --> 48:30.664
We had rather too many leftovers

48:30.697 --> 48:32.365
and it seems a shame
to waste them.

48:32.398 --> 48:33.400
- So...
- Well, alright.

48:33.434 --> 48:34.735
- Would you like?
- Lovely, yes.

48:34.768 --> 48:36.304
Yes, well, please, come in.

48:36.336 --> 48:38.139
Come in.

48:39.873 --> 48:41.009
Yeah.

48:44.911 --> 48:45.946
Uh, oh.

48:45.980 --> 48:47.514
- Um, where would you like them?
- Oh yes.

48:47.547 --> 48:48.648
Um, right.

48:48.681 --> 48:51.652
Uh, right, yeah.

48:54.188 --> 48:55.856
That's... that's... yeah.

48:55.889 --> 48:57.458
Here, g... give me your coat.

48:57.490 --> 48:58.992
Oh, thank you.

48:59.025 --> 49:00.193
Thank you.

49:00.226 --> 49:01.394
What a nice apartment!

49:01.427 --> 49:03.563
- No, it's a flat.
- Oh.

49:03.597 --> 49:05.365
Not Americans.

49:05.398 --> 49:06.733
- It's a flat.
- Hmm.

49:06.766 --> 49:08.501
- Within a house.
- Oh.

49:08.534 --> 49:11.438
Of course, it uh,
used to be a whole house

49:11.472 --> 49:12.473
once upon a time,

49:12.505 --> 49:14.307
but that's what we do
these days.

49:14.340 --> 49:17.577
We chop, chop, chop, chop.

49:17.610 --> 49:20.313
We'll be living in a cupboard
in 30 years.

49:21.514 --> 49:23.150
We won't be around in 30 years.

49:23.182 --> 49:24.184
Lucky us.

49:24.217 --> 49:25.353
Hmm.

49:34.128 --> 49:36.864
Thank you very much
for the flowers, by the way.

49:36.896 --> 49:39.900
Oh, uh, thank you for the uh...

49:39.932 --> 49:41.534
- Eclairs.
- Confectionery.

49:41.568 --> 49:43.270
Yeah, thank you.

49:43.302 --> 49:44.638
Thank you.

49:49.777 --> 49:52.313
So you really are an inventor.

49:52.346 --> 49:54.315
Well, I keep trying.

49:54.347 --> 49:56.182
- Voilà!
- Oh!

49:57.985 --> 50:01.021
Yeah, when you're inventing,
you're looking for something

50:01.054 --> 50:03.556
that people don't know
that they want.

50:03.590 --> 50:05.760
Oh my goodness!

50:11.597 --> 50:13.933
This was Sarah's favourite book.

50:13.967 --> 50:16.637
I used to read it to her
when we were on tour.

50:16.670 --> 50:17.938
- Phileas Fogg.
- Hmm.

50:17.971 --> 50:19.239
Yes.

50:19.273 --> 50:21.475
Inveterate rival of mine, yes.

50:21.507 --> 50:24.978
Great inventor,
intrepid traveller.

50:25.012 --> 50:27.548
Mind you, these days
we don't need to travel

50:27.581 --> 50:29.550
to discover the world.

50:29.583 --> 50:33.153
The world has come to us.

50:41.461 --> 50:42.663
Oh, sorry.

50:42.695 --> 50:44.398
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

50:54.942 --> 50:57.077
Hello, I have
a delivery here for Mimi.

50:57.110 --> 50:58.179
Thank you.

50:58.211 --> 50:59.980
Can you sign here, please?

51:00.847 --> 51:02.182
Thank you.

51:02.215 --> 51:04.050
Uh, ooh, actually um,

51:04.083 --> 51:07.721
why don't you try a slice
of this?

51:07.755 --> 51:09.323
W... what... what is it?

51:09.356 --> 51:12.526
This is a strawberry fraisier.

51:12.559 --> 51:13.961
Frais-fraisier?

51:13.994 --> 51:16.664
Yeah, it's like this
creamy strawberry...

51:16.697 --> 51:18.132
Jelly mix.

51:18.164 --> 51:21.134
Yeah, sort of thing,
if you're into that.

51:21.168 --> 51:23.503
Oh, okay.

51:23.536 --> 51:25.405
Can't have this.

51:25.438 --> 51:26.873
Th... thank... thank you.

51:26.907 --> 51:28.375
Yeah.

51:28.407 --> 51:29.476
Um.

51:29.510 --> 51:31.178
Um, hello,
excuse me.

51:31.210 --> 51:33.012
Just a second.

51:33.045 --> 51:35.582
Um, take that out for a minute.

51:35.615 --> 51:37.083
Where are you from?

51:37.117 --> 51:38.119
Express Bikes, why?

51:38.152 --> 51:39.186
No, no, don't tell the...

51:39.219 --> 51:40.521
What country?

51:40.554 --> 51:41.555
Oh, Latvia.

51:41.588 --> 51:42.690
- Latvia?
- Hmm.

51:42.722 --> 51:45.291
And what do you have at home
for a treat?

51:45.324 --> 51:47.027
I... I... I do not understand.

51:47.059 --> 51:49.096
If you went to
a bakery, what would you buy?

51:49.128 --> 51:50.931
- All sorts.
- No, that's what I mean.

51:50.963 --> 51:53.299
What exactly would you buy?

51:53.333 --> 51:54.367
Don't yell at me, lady.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.402
No, I'm just asking you

51:55.434 --> 51:56.670
what was your favourite.

51:56.702 --> 52:00.474
I don't know,
I suppose kringle.

52:00.507 --> 52:01.842
What's that?

52:01.875 --> 52:06.012
It's... it's like
this sweet bread thing.

52:06.045 --> 52:07.480
Oh, it's so good.

52:07.514 --> 52:10.885
And can you get them in London?

52:10.918 --> 52:12.486
I don't know,
I... I don't think so.

52:12.518 --> 52:14.053
But would you if you could?

52:14.086 --> 52:15.322
Of course.

52:15.355 --> 52:16.356
Good.

52:16.389 --> 52:17.692
Okay, you can go now.

52:25.865 --> 52:28.201
- Where's Matthew?
- He's in the kitchen.

52:28.235 --> 52:29.403
Matthew!

52:29.436 --> 52:31.105
Look, let's look around us.

52:31.137 --> 52:34.240
London is the most
multicultural city on Earth.

52:34.273 --> 52:35.208
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

52:35.242 --> 52:36.310
It's like a sort of

52:36.342 --> 52:37.677
cosmopolitan collective,

52:37.710 --> 52:40.914
but nobody's actually
from here, are they?

52:40.947 --> 52:42.916
I mean, if I think about it, uh,
Boris,

52:42.949 --> 52:46.920
my butcher is Hungarian,
my yoga teacher is Russian,

52:46.954 --> 52:48.756
and Nicoletta,
who runs the flower shop,

52:48.789 --> 52:50.024
she's from Italy.

52:50.056 --> 52:53.893
What do you think these people
would really like?

52:53.927 --> 52:56.329
Something to remind them
of home.

52:56.362 --> 52:57.498
Right.

52:57.530 --> 52:58.532
Like that young boy

52:58.565 --> 52:59.700
who came in minute ago.

52:59.733 --> 53:02.135
He doesn't know
strawberry frasier or...

53:02.168 --> 53:04.637
- Fraisier.
- Fraisier, whatever it is.

53:04.670 --> 53:05.873
He doesn't know that.

53:05.905 --> 53:07.875
He only knows a kringle.

53:07.907 --> 53:10.243
And if he wants a kringle,
then let's make him one.

53:10.277 --> 53:12.579
I mean, he can't be
the only Latvian in London.

53:12.612 --> 53:14.447
This city is home
to so many people

53:14.481 --> 53:15.816
from all over the place.

53:15.849 --> 53:17.785
If the government stops tryin'
to kick 'em out.

53:17.818 --> 53:19.220
So what
are you saying?

53:19.253 --> 53:24.225
We make our bakery
a home away from home.

53:24.257 --> 53:26.125
I mean, Sarah loved to travel,
didn't she?

53:26.159 --> 53:28.796
Discovering new food,
when she was studying abroad.

53:28.829 --> 53:34.201
So why didn't we bake foods
that no one else bakes?

53:34.233 --> 53:39.206
Something for our customers
to remind them of home.

53:39.239 --> 53:40.307
What do you think?

53:43.010 --> 53:43.811
It'll be fine.

53:43.844 --> 53:45.378
I just... we just need

53:45.411 --> 53:47.714
to research it, I think.

54:18.344 --> 54:20.179
Okay.

54:21.815 --> 54:23.550
- Okay.
- Oh, look.

54:23.583 --> 54:24.585
Oh, it looks great.

54:40.833 --> 54:43.369
- Isabella.
- Yeah.

54:43.402 --> 54:44.605
In the kitchen.

54:44.637 --> 54:46.306
- What?
- Now.

54:52.612 --> 54:54.514
What was that?

54:54.547 --> 54:56.250
So you're gonna join me or what?

55:11.764 --> 55:14.100
And then sukker, kanel, smør,
like dash, dash, dash.

55:14.134 --> 55:15.135
Thick.

55:15.168 --> 55:16.403
You fold it over

55:16.436 --> 55:18.706
into thin stripe
and then we twin the...

55:18.739 --> 55:20.039
Thin stripe?

55:20.072 --> 55:21.607
Like um, twist, you know?

55:21.641 --> 55:22.608
Twisty.

55:23.844 --> 55:26.780
This is the roll, right?

55:26.813 --> 55:28.949
Use both hands
and just like that.

55:28.981 --> 55:29.882
Harder.

55:29.916 --> 55:31.352
Okay, we use...
just a good hand, right?

55:31.385 --> 55:33.854
And then hand around, twice.

55:33.887 --> 55:35.722
Then you pop it through.

55:35.755 --> 55:38.658
- Kanelsnegl.
- Great.

55:38.692 --> 55:40.327
Yeah, it's so easy.

55:40.360 --> 55:41.662
How many do you want?

55:41.695 --> 55:45.332
Um, 30.

55:45.364 --> 55:46.366
- That'd be good?
- Perfect.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.367
Wondering if I would...

55:47.400 --> 55:49.302
Ow!

55:49.335 --> 55:50.436
Oh God.

56:08.054 --> 56:10.023
Oh yeah.

56:12.291 --> 56:14.394
It's his new invention.

56:14.427 --> 56:16.262
Yeah.

56:16.295 --> 56:17.330
Oh, Felix.

56:17.364 --> 56:18.565
Hmm.

56:18.597 --> 56:20.166
- Uh...
- Oh, sorry. I beg your pardon.

56:20.199 --> 56:21.434
Yeah, sorry.

56:21.467 --> 56:22.469
Yeah.

56:59.206 --> 57:01.008
I'm not sure
that needs too much icing.

57:01.041 --> 57:01.842
Mmm.

57:01.875 --> 57:02.809
- What do you think?
- No.

57:02.842 --> 57:04.877
- What's that called?
- Panforte.

57:04.911 --> 57:06.512
- Panfortes.
- Mmm.

57:06.545 --> 57:07.780
- Panforte.
- Panforte.

57:07.813 --> 57:09.182
- Oh, it's so good.
- Can I try this one?

57:09.215 --> 57:11.851
Yeah, that's Australian,
it's a lamington.

57:11.885 --> 57:13.253
Loads of Aussies here.

57:13.286 --> 57:14.889
Hmm.

57:16.021 --> 57:19.992
I think we need a proper
taste test with some locals.

57:20.025 --> 57:22.096
Yeah, but who?

57:22.128 --> 57:23.897
Actually, I know who.

57:29.302 --> 57:30.838
Mimi.

57:30.871 --> 57:32.806
Hello, Olga.

57:32.838 --> 57:35.074
You got room for one more?

57:35.108 --> 57:36.643
So this one is...

57:36.675 --> 57:38.344
Tanzanian.

57:38.378 --> 57:39.546
- Tanzanian?
- Yeah.

57:39.579 --> 57:41.914
Mmm, delicious.

57:41.947 --> 57:43.516
Are there many
Tanzanians in London?

57:43.550 --> 57:45.052
- 17,000.
- Hmm.

57:45.085 --> 57:48.387
4,000 Venezuelans,
16,000 Russians,

57:48.420 --> 57:50.389
5,000 Norwegians.

57:50.422 --> 57:51.557
And a partridge in a pear tree.

57:52.759 --> 57:54.461
And Hondurans?

57:54.494 --> 57:56.896
Oh, Louisa, I'll have to check.

57:58.097 --> 57:59.465
But I will, though.

57:59.498 --> 58:00.500
Mimi.

58:00.534 --> 58:02.169
Mimi, I love it!

59:10.869 --> 59:12.005
Mimi, what are you doing?

59:12.038 --> 59:13.440
I thought
this was a good idea

59:13.472 --> 59:14.807
for our Instagram account.

59:14.840 --> 59:16.543
No, no, no, no,
Instagram is for me.

59:16.576 --> 59:17.610
I was settin' that.

59:17.643 --> 59:19.245
Look, black forest gateau.
Delicious.

59:19.278 --> 59:21.715
- That's actually very good.
- Do you like?

59:33.425 --> 59:34.827
Hmm.

59:35.762 --> 59:38.599
Mmm!

59:38.632 --> 59:39.633
Can I help you?

59:39.666 --> 59:40.901
Mmm.

59:40.934 --> 59:43.570
Yes, um, can I have
a large cappuccino

59:43.603 --> 59:45.472
and um, <i>pain au chocolat</i> to go,
please.

59:45.505 --> 59:46.673
Of course.

59:46.706 --> 59:49.242
£4.75 please.

59:50.443 --> 59:51.678
Where are you from?

59:51.710 --> 59:53.679
- Tokyo.
- Ah!

59:53.713 --> 59:58.118
Um, matcha mille crepe cake.

59:58.150 --> 59:58.985
Yes!

59:59.018 --> 01:00:00.920
How do you know?

01:00:00.954 --> 01:00:03.056
- Do you make them?
- We can.

01:00:03.088 --> 01:00:05.558
Well,
if you make it I'll buy it.

01:00:05.592 --> 01:00:06.693
Deal.

01:00:06.726 --> 01:00:10.030
Can you do me one
by tomorrow morning?

01:00:10.063 --> 01:00:11.999
Why not?

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:25.311
The Japanese clearly have
too much time on their hands.

01:00:28.748 --> 01:00:31.418
What should we do?

01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:32.686
I don't know.

01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:34.086
Start again.

01:00:34.119 --> 01:00:37.190
I guess.

01:00:37.222 --> 01:00:40.126
I've got a better idea.

01:00:40.159 --> 01:00:42.061
And it's not...
you were just confident.

01:00:42.094 --> 01:00:43.763
You both were.
You were made for each other.

01:00:43.797 --> 01:00:46.565
It's not about confidence,
it's about balls.

01:00:46.599 --> 01:00:47.701
You got to grow
a pair of balls.

01:00:47.733 --> 01:00:49.369
- Sarah had balls?
- Yeah, massive balls!

01:00:49.402 --> 01:00:51.570
- Huge!
- You kidding?

01:00:51.603 --> 01:00:52.905
That's what you got to do
in life.

01:00:52.938 --> 01:00:54.574
- Pretend you've got big balls.
- Right.

01:00:54.606 --> 01:00:56.175
I mean, people like me,
we're just pretending.

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:59.211
And then we busk through life,
performing,

01:00:59.244 --> 01:01:01.748
when really underneath it all,
we're just...

01:01:03.382 --> 01:01:05.351
We're just like everybody else
you know, frightened,

01:01:05.385 --> 01:01:08.155
scared,

01:01:08.188 --> 01:01:10.724
insecure.

01:01:12.592 --> 01:01:14.628
Only we walk the walk.

01:01:14.661 --> 01:01:16.563
That's what you've got to do.

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:18.030
Just walk?

01:01:18.063 --> 01:01:19.632
Swagger.

01:01:19.666 --> 01:01:22.501
Better than everybody else.

01:01:22.534 --> 01:01:25.371
Well,
that's easier said than done.

01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:27.941
Oh, you're a good Baker,
Isabella.

01:01:27.974 --> 01:01:31.044
You're talented,
you're creative, you just...

01:01:31.077 --> 01:01:33.413
You got to get out
of those sensible shoes.

01:01:33.445 --> 01:01:36.415
Thanks.

01:01:36.449 --> 01:01:38.552
Get 'em off.

01:01:38.585 --> 01:01:39.586
What?

01:01:39.619 --> 01:01:41.555
Show me your Louboutins.

01:01:41.588 --> 01:01:43.223
- I don't have Louboutins.
- Yeah, you do.

01:01:43.255 --> 01:01:44.257
Come on, get up.

01:01:44.289 --> 01:01:45.726
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

01:01:45.759 --> 01:01:46.992
Repeat after me.

01:01:47.025 --> 01:01:50.230
I'm the best goddamn baker
in the whole world.

01:01:50.262 --> 01:01:51.264
- No!
- Better than...

01:01:51.297 --> 01:01:52.699
- My God.
- Everybody else.

01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:54.067
- Stop, Matthew.
- Come on, say it!

01:01:54.099 --> 01:01:54.933
Okay, fine.

01:01:54.967 --> 01:01:56.902
- I'm a good baker, okay?
- A good baker?

01:01:56.936 --> 01:02:00.474
Well, you're wearing brogues
right now, like flip-flops!

01:02:00.507 --> 01:02:01.608
I asked for Louboutins.

01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:03.510
I'm the best baker in the world.

01:02:03.543 --> 01:02:04.878
Louder!

01:02:04.911 --> 01:02:06.679
I'm the best goddamn baker
in the whole fucking world!

01:02:08.148 --> 01:02:10.117
Are you happy?

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:11.518
Second best.

01:02:19.425 --> 01:02:20.527
You know...

01:02:21.795 --> 01:02:25.132
You're probably never
gonna believe me.

01:02:25.164 --> 01:02:27.733
And it...

01:02:27.766 --> 01:02:29.702
It makes... makes me sound
like a bit of an arse,

01:02:29.735 --> 01:02:33.272
but when we were uh...

01:02:33.306 --> 01:02:34.574
When we were in school,

01:02:34.606 --> 01:02:37.076
in Paris...

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:39.512
And I got together with Sarah.

01:02:39.545 --> 01:02:41.213
Mmhmm.

01:02:41.246 --> 01:02:43.182
That night I came over...

01:02:47.987 --> 01:02:50.090
It wasn't her
that I was looking for.

01:02:55.527 --> 01:02:57.430
You're right, you're an arse.

01:03:11.643 --> 01:03:13.379
We have to work in the morning.

01:03:19.686 --> 01:03:23.090
At 4:00 a.m.

01:03:28.961 --> 01:03:31.431
Japanese bloody matcha cake.

01:04:14.606 --> 01:04:16.108
Do you want this?

01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:17.743
Oh, thank you.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.182
You shouldn't really be smoking.

01:04:23.215 --> 01:04:24.451
Oh yeah?
Why is that?

01:04:24.483 --> 01:04:26.619
Because you're a dancer.

01:04:26.652 --> 01:04:28.053
Not really anymore.

01:04:31.557 --> 01:04:33.893
When are you gonna go back
to class?

01:04:33.927 --> 01:04:35.095
Um.

01:04:35.996 --> 01:04:38.597
I don't know,
I wasn't planning on it.

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:40.733
Don't leave it too late.

01:04:40.766 --> 01:04:41.768
Mmhmm.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.070
Don't waste your talent,
Clarissa.

01:04:45.103 --> 01:04:48.073
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

01:04:48.106 --> 01:04:49.608
Well, it's just hard right now,
isn't it?

01:04:49.641 --> 01:04:51.110
- Why?
- 'Cause we've got the bakery.

01:04:51.143 --> 01:04:54.013
The bakery?
But it's all set up now.

01:04:55.181 --> 01:04:59.086
You did that for your mum
and it's great.

01:05:02.255 --> 01:05:05.025
I just really miss her.

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:08.261
I know.

01:05:08.293 --> 01:05:10.029
So do I.

01:05:12.731 --> 01:05:15.335
I wish you would tell me
what happened with you guys.

01:05:19.938 --> 01:05:21.774
Alright.

01:05:23.275 --> 01:05:27.413
Your mum came to me to ask me
to give her some money

01:05:27.447 --> 01:05:31.184
to set up the bakery
with Isabella

01:05:31.217 --> 01:05:33.653
and I turned her down.

01:05:35.355 --> 01:05:38.557
And she accused me
of never being there for her.

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:41.193
Actually, she was right.

01:05:41.226 --> 01:05:43.195
- Hmm.
- I wasn't.

01:05:45.931 --> 01:05:48.000
We'd stopped talking
to each other.

01:05:51.304 --> 01:05:53.340
That was the saddest thing.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:05.619
Don't let us ever be like that.

01:06:05.652 --> 01:06:06.720
- Yeah, no...
- Promise?

01:06:06.753 --> 01:06:08.722
Yeah, promise.

01:06:19.164 --> 01:06:21.500
You still hate me?

01:06:21.534 --> 01:06:22.535
Yes, I do.

01:06:32.844 --> 01:06:34.413
Oh shit.

01:06:34.447 --> 01:06:36.483
We should get up.

01:06:36.516 --> 01:06:38.885
Yeah.

01:06:38.918 --> 01:06:39.919
We should.

01:07:48.286 --> 01:07:49.922
Isabella!

01:07:54.193 --> 01:07:56.496
Isabella!

01:07:56.528 --> 01:07:57.731
The key's in that...

01:07:57.764 --> 01:07:59.865
What's going on?
Let me in.

01:08:01.934 --> 01:08:03.103
I'm so sorry.

01:08:03.135 --> 01:08:06.806
I... aren't you supposed to be
at Gastrell's?

01:08:07.606 --> 01:08:08.775
Look, I can explain.

01:08:08.807 --> 01:08:09.976
I can't hear you.

01:08:10.009 --> 01:08:10.777
Come on, open up.

01:08:10.809 --> 01:08:13.712
Oh, bake with me, Isabella!

01:08:13.746 --> 01:08:15.682
Be our passion.

01:08:15.715 --> 01:08:17.417
Why? So you can just go off
somewhere better?

01:08:17.448 --> 01:08:18.952
- No, it's not like that.
- Isn't it?

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:21.252
No, I wanted you to bake with
me, because you're a good baker.

01:08:21.287 --> 01:08:23.689
Right, well, this good baker's
got work to do, okay?

01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:26.426
- Isabella.
- Just...

01:08:26.457 --> 01:08:27.728
Fuck off!

01:08:54.554 --> 01:08:55.988
Is that... look, we got sesame.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.023
Yes, it does.

01:08:58.122 --> 01:08:59.425
Oh.

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:01.193
Oh!

01:09:01.225 --> 01:09:03.261
Matcha mille crepe cake.

01:09:03.296 --> 01:09:04.430
Well done!

01:09:04.462 --> 01:09:06.800
- That is perfect.
- Thank you.

01:09:28.621 --> 01:09:30.288
Can we talk?

01:09:36.295 --> 01:09:39.798
They sent me the contract
to try and entice me.

01:09:39.832 --> 01:09:41.835
So you have thought about it?

01:09:41.868 --> 01:09:42.669
Briefly.

01:09:42.702 --> 01:09:43.868
- Do you want to go?
- No.

01:09:43.903 --> 01:09:45.404
I thought you
were looking for a challenge.

01:09:45.438 --> 01:09:46.971
- I am!
- Bollocks!

01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:49.676
Matthew, you're here because you
think Clarissa's your daughter.

01:09:49.707 --> 01:09:52.778
- No.
- Oh, come on!

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:55.280
Alright, I mean,
maybe in the beginning...

01:09:56.481 --> 01:09:57.818
For a bit, but...

01:10:00.819 --> 01:10:03.722
Things have changed.

01:10:04.789 --> 01:10:06.592
You know what?
Just... just go, alright?

01:10:06.626 --> 01:10:08.461
And don't come back.

01:10:08.493 --> 01:10:09.828
Is this
because we slept together?

01:10:09.862 --> 01:10:11.197
Because Sarah
wouldn't have liked...

01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:13.599
No.
N...

01:10:13.632 --> 01:10:15.400
No, it's because
from the minute you got here,

01:10:15.434 --> 01:10:16.869
I said...

01:10:16.903 --> 01:10:20.340
I said you were bad news
and look how it's turned out.

01:10:20.372 --> 01:10:22.407
You need me here.

01:10:23.743 --> 01:10:30.182
You said it yourself...
I can bake all by myself.

01:10:38.623 --> 01:10:40.726
Is everythin' okay?

01:10:42.228 --> 01:10:43.596
I'll see you around.

01:10:53.139 --> 01:10:54.207
Oh.

01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:55.240
Oh yeah.

01:10:59.177 --> 01:11:00.246
Oh, my knees.

01:11:01.613 --> 01:11:03.949
Aha.

01:11:03.983 --> 01:11:05.318
Eureka.

01:11:08.154 --> 01:11:10.123
Thank you.

01:11:16.395 --> 01:11:18.831
Can you please stop
being so stubborn?

01:11:18.863 --> 01:11:20.832
Just let Matthew come back,
he's part of our team.

01:11:20.865 --> 01:11:22.234
If you've got
nothing useful to say,

01:11:22.268 --> 01:11:23.269
then get out
of my kitchen.

01:11:23.301 --> 01:11:24.369
Mimi, she's distracting me!

01:11:24.403 --> 01:11:26.005
Well, I agree with Clarissa.

01:11:26.037 --> 01:11:28.473
Anyway, 35 top-thin knödel.

01:11:28.506 --> 01:11:30.475
- Good luck.
- Oh.

01:11:30.509 --> 01:11:31.877
I was speaking
with Matthew last night...

01:11:31.911 --> 01:11:33.846
And he misses us.

01:11:33.878 --> 01:11:35.480
Honestly, he just...
he misses you.

01:11:35.514 --> 01:11:37.884
Yeah, I'm not interested.

01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:39.485
Really?

01:11:39.518 --> 01:11:40.819
No.

01:11:40.853 --> 01:11:42.387
CLARISSA
Okay, then.

01:11:42.421 --> 01:11:43.623
- Come with me!
- What?

01:11:43.655 --> 01:11:44.990
- Here we go, this way.
- Wait, this...

01:11:45.024 --> 01:11:46.759
This way.

01:11:46.792 --> 01:11:47.794
Excuse me.

01:11:47.827 --> 01:11:48.927
Hi, I'm so sorry to disturb you.

01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:50.630
- Hi.
- Uh, are you single?

01:11:50.662 --> 01:11:51.863
- Larie.
- Uh, yeah.

01:11:51.896 --> 01:11:52.731
Great.

01:11:52.765 --> 01:11:53.932
No, he was checking you out
earlier.

01:11:53.966 --> 01:11:55.601
Do you wanna go
on a date with her tonight?

01:11:55.634 --> 01:11:57.869
She baked you that croissant
that you're eating.

01:11:57.903 --> 01:12:00.405
So imagine her baking
that for you every morning

01:12:00.439 --> 01:12:03.543
with bacon, and eggs, and sex.

01:12:03.576 --> 01:12:05.545
- Uh, if she wants to uh...
- She does.

01:12:05.578 --> 01:12:07.280
You should come
pick her up tonight at 7:15.

01:12:09.015 --> 01:12:11.651
- Uh, sure, yeah.
- Okay, great.

01:12:11.684 --> 01:12:13.219
- I got to talk to you.
- No, you don't.

01:12:13.252 --> 01:12:14.153
Clarissa, I've got...

01:12:14.186 --> 01:12:15.488
Sorry, she has a funny way
of doing things.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.521
- Hi.
- It's nice to meet you,

01:12:16.555 --> 01:12:17.856
- I'm Isabella.
- I'm Pascal.

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:18.891
- Oh, Pascal.
- Nice to meet you.

01:12:18.923 --> 01:12:20.059
- You're French.
- Yes, yes.

01:12:20.091 --> 01:12:21.493
I have to get back.
You liked the croissant?

01:12:21.527 --> 01:12:22.996
Yeah, it's amazing croissant.

01:12:23.029 --> 01:12:24.163
That's good.

01:12:24.195 --> 01:12:26.131
Um.

01:12:37.976 --> 01:12:41.913
So do you often
get set up like this?

01:12:41.947 --> 01:12:43.149
Never.

01:12:43.181 --> 01:12:44.550
Really?

01:12:44.582 --> 01:12:46.418
That girl should set up
a dating agency.

01:12:46.452 --> 01:12:47.587
- She'd make a fortune.
- Oh yeah.

01:12:49.488 --> 01:12:51.057
Cheers.

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:52.257
Cheers.

01:12:53.591 --> 01:12:54.860
Hmm.

01:12:58.029 --> 01:12:58.831
What?

01:12:58.863 --> 01:13:01.400
S... somewhere to be?

01:13:01.434 --> 01:13:04.871
No, sorry... well...
Yes.

01:13:04.904 --> 01:13:06.672
Actually, I'm sorry,
it's just we had

01:13:06.704 --> 01:13:09.509
this really big tricky order
come in for tomorrow

01:13:09.542 --> 01:13:13.413
and now all I can think about
is whipping, and creaming,

01:13:13.445 --> 01:13:15.847
and tossing, and... oh God!

01:13:15.881 --> 01:13:17.884
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

01:13:17.917 --> 01:13:19.318
It's alright,
we can do this another time...

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:20.920
- Mm-mm.
- If you want.

01:13:20.953 --> 01:13:22.288
No, no,
this is good for me.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.922
I... I need to relax.

01:13:23.956 --> 01:13:26.626
It's gonna be fine, right?

01:13:26.658 --> 01:13:27.692
Well, work is work, you know?

01:13:27.725 --> 01:13:29.728
- Just...
- Right.

01:13:29.761 --> 01:13:31.630
Well, isn't this cozy?

01:13:32.597 --> 01:13:33.733
Sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt.

01:13:33.765 --> 01:13:35.634
I'm Pascal, by the way.

01:13:35.667 --> 01:13:37.135
Pascal?

01:13:37.168 --> 01:13:38.470
Hmm.

01:13:38.503 --> 01:13:39.838
He's very French, isn't he?

01:13:43.309 --> 01:13:44.777
You tense?

01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:46.479
See the way she's sitting?
She does that when she's tense.

01:13:46.511 --> 01:13:47.913
You're not making her tense,
are you, Pascal?

01:13:47.947 --> 01:13:49.215
- I just...
- Matthew, come on.

01:13:49.247 --> 01:13:50.482
A date shouldn't be tense.

01:13:50.515 --> 01:13:51.716
A date should be exciting.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.219
Although, it has to be said

01:13:53.252 --> 01:13:54.454
she's a very tense person.

01:13:54.487 --> 01:13:56.056
Matthew, come on.

01:14:00.759 --> 01:14:03.695
But she completely gets away
with it, because she's...

01:14:06.064 --> 01:14:08.835
She's great and...

01:14:08.868 --> 01:14:12.305
...you'd be lucky to have her,
Pascal, tense or untense.

01:14:18.377 --> 01:14:20.646
Alright, look,
I've made mistakes.

01:14:20.679 --> 01:14:21.913
Okay, fine.

01:14:21.947 --> 01:14:23.882
I'm a... I'm a terrible person

01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:26.619
and if Clarissa is my daughter,

01:14:26.652 --> 01:14:28.253
then it'll be really difficult.

01:14:28.287 --> 01:14:31.958
But I... I just want you to know
that I'm...

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.627
I'm in this for the long haul,
I'm not going anywhere.

01:14:35.828 --> 01:14:38.832
Whether you like it or not,
alright?

01:14:47.305 --> 01:14:48.674
Enjoy your date.

01:14:57.349 --> 01:14:58.784
I like mille-feuille the best.

01:14:58.817 --> 01:15:00.953
Would you make a mille-feuille?

01:15:09.996 --> 01:15:12.364
I was gonna send it off. Yeah.

01:15:17.302 --> 01:15:20.773
Find out, but um...

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.443
Well, once I got to know you...

01:15:27.546 --> 01:15:29.282
It just didn't seem right.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.690
So what do you wanna do?

01:15:38.724 --> 01:15:40.627
Do you wanna find out?

01:15:44.128 --> 01:15:45.765
Yeah.

01:15:51.237 --> 01:15:52.337
I think so.

01:15:52.371 --> 01:15:54.774
Um, yeah, I've
only done 5p so far, so...

01:15:54.806 --> 01:15:57.143
- You've done what?
- 5p so...

01:15:57.176 --> 01:15:58.144
Come in.

01:15:58.176 --> 01:16:00.078
Oh, hello again.

01:16:00.112 --> 01:16:02.215
Hi.

01:16:02.247 --> 01:16:05.050
Um, I know this is huge,

01:16:05.083 --> 01:16:08.354
but you could maybe do me two
of those matcha cake

01:16:08.386 --> 01:16:11.023
by tomorrow 9:00 a.m.

01:16:11.055 --> 01:16:12.190
Two?

01:16:12.224 --> 01:16:13.859
Oh, we have
these big Tuesday meetings

01:16:13.891 --> 01:16:16.229
and it's my turn to cater,

01:16:16.261 --> 01:16:19.331
and I was telling all
my colleagues how good you are.

01:16:19.364 --> 01:16:21.233
Consider it done.

01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:23.635
You're my lifesaver.

01:16:23.668 --> 01:16:25.770
Oh, you can't just spring that
on me.

01:16:25.804 --> 01:16:27.006
You made one last time.

01:16:27.038 --> 01:16:28.440
Yeah, one.

01:16:28.474 --> 01:16:29.742
But now, this is two.

01:16:29.774 --> 01:16:31.376
On top of everything else.

01:16:31.409 --> 01:16:33.613
Well, you're just
gonna have to call Matthew.

01:16:35.514 --> 01:16:36.515
No.

01:16:36.547 --> 01:16:37.649
Well, one thing
is for sure,

01:16:37.682 --> 01:16:39.085
you better make them good.

01:16:43.154 --> 01:16:43.956
Time Out.

01:16:43.988 --> 01:16:46.324
- Mmhmm.
- Mmhmm.

01:16:59.438 --> 01:17:00.706
Oh!

01:17:06.011 --> 01:17:08.014
Oh!

01:18:41.239 --> 01:18:44.710
Ooh! Sorry.
Thank you very much.

01:18:45.877 --> 01:18:46.978
Hello.

01:18:47.011 --> 01:18:50.582
Um, I'm here to drop these off
for Yuuna Tanaka.

01:18:50.615 --> 01:18:51.917
I'll tell her they're here.

01:18:51.949 --> 01:18:53.284
Oh, no, no,
don't worry about it.

01:18:53.318 --> 01:18:55.087
I can take them up myself.

01:18:55.119 --> 01:18:56.788
They'll be okay here.

01:18:59.557 --> 01:19:01.460
Okay, sure.

01:19:01.493 --> 01:19:03.062
Um, please don't...

01:19:03.095 --> 01:19:03.896
These you go.

01:19:03.929 --> 01:19:06.065
Careful with them.
Thank you.

01:19:13.104 --> 01:19:15.473
I don't know I can't see them.

01:19:15.506 --> 01:19:16.808
<i>Why not?</i>

01:19:16.841 --> 01:19:19.177
I don't know
which office they're in, Mimi.

01:19:19.211 --> 01:19:20.546
<i>Oh.</i>

01:19:20.578 --> 01:19:21.846
Oh, hang on.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.516
<i>But what can you
actually see, Clarissa?</i>

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:26.719
Hold on.

01:19:26.752 --> 01:19:28.221
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.557
Well, I can see people chatting,
but no cakes.

01:19:32.591 --> 01:19:33.592
<i>Oh.</i>

01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:35.094
Excuse me.

01:19:35.127 --> 01:19:36.128
Can I help you?

01:19:36.161 --> 01:19:37.863
Hello.

01:19:37.895 --> 01:19:39.331
Is this man with you?

01:19:40.399 --> 01:19:42.701
Shh!

01:19:42.734 --> 01:19:44.303
No, I have no idea.

01:19:59.184 --> 01:20:00.853
So, um...

01:20:02.488 --> 01:20:04.123
...you gonna see that guy again?

01:20:12.497 --> 01:20:14.733
I'm gonna keep my options open.

01:20:26.177 --> 01:20:27.246
Matthew.

01:21:04.416 --> 01:21:05.684
Well...

01:21:05.716 --> 01:21:07.286
This is me.

01:21:07.319 --> 01:21:09.889
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:09.921 --> 01:21:11.589
Thank you for walking me home.

01:21:11.622 --> 01:21:13.324
Well, it's good for the legs.

01:21:13.358 --> 01:21:15.127
It stops them from seizing up.

01:21:21.432 --> 01:21:23.068
Good night, Felix.

01:21:24.536 --> 01:21:25.538
Good night, Mimi.

01:21:28.806 --> 01:21:32.010
Actually, would you like
to come in for a coffee?

01:21:34.512 --> 01:21:37.582
So long as it's decaf.

01:21:37.615 --> 01:21:40.418
Otherwise,
I might be up all night.

01:21:40.452 --> 01:21:42.288
Lucky me.

01:22:20.559 --> 01:22:23.429
Did you ever watch <i>Jeremy Kyle?</i>

01:22:23.462 --> 01:22:25.798
No.

01:22:25.831 --> 01:22:29.668
They did these live DNA tests.

01:22:29.701 --> 01:22:31.537
Can you imagine?

01:22:32.837 --> 01:22:34.974
Must be fun for them, I suppose.

01:22:35.006 --> 01:22:38.143
I don't think it's fun
for anyone.

01:22:38.176 --> 01:22:41.313
More fun than STDs.

01:22:41.345 --> 01:22:43.548
That must be the worst, right?

01:22:43.582 --> 01:22:44.583
Weeping vag...

01:22:44.615 --> 01:22:45.818
Oh my God.

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:47.052
Sorry.

01:22:48.787 --> 01:22:50.222
I'm a bit nervous.

01:22:56.094 --> 01:22:58.262
Listen.

01:23:00.364 --> 01:23:01.766
If I'm not your father...

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.636
- Whoa.
- No, no.

01:23:03.668 --> 01:23:07.405
- If I'm not...
- No, Matthew, please.

01:23:07.439 --> 01:23:10.743
I can still be there for you.

01:23:10.775 --> 01:23:13.645
You really don't have
to say that.

01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:16.280
I want to.

01:23:16.314 --> 01:23:19.118
Um, be there.

01:23:26.725 --> 01:23:28.727
I'm scared of the dark,
I'm terrible with money,

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.462
and I smoke far too much weed.

01:23:30.494 --> 01:23:32.131
Why would you want me?

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:41.072
Matthew, Clarissa,

01:23:41.105 --> 01:23:43.341
so sorry
to have kept you waiting.

01:23:44.975 --> 01:23:47.880
I'm afraid the results
aren't quite

01:23:47.912 --> 01:23:50.348
what I think you might be
hoping for.

01:23:52.783 --> 01:23:55.320
The test results are negative.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.194
We do have
a counsellor available

01:24:03.228 --> 01:24:07.099
if that might be of help.

01:24:14.439 --> 01:24:17.043
Do people get excited
when you tell them it's a "yes"?

01:24:34.626 --> 01:24:36.328
Hello, Mimi Curachi speaking.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.729
<i>Hi, Mrs. Curachi.</i>

01:24:37.762 --> 01:24:38.997
Um...
What?

01:24:39.029 --> 01:24:40.032
<i>This is, uh,</i>

01:24:40.064 --> 01:24:41.466
<i>Yuuna Tanaka's assistant here.</i>

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.002
<i>Do you have a moment to speak?</i>

01:24:44.034 --> 01:24:45.069
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:24:45.103 --> 01:24:47.072
<i>Tuff Turf,</i> Robert Downey, Jr.

01:24:47.104 --> 01:24:49.073
- Oh my God.
- They're gonna run a feature!

01:24:49.106 --> 01:24:50.408
- Who?
- Time Out!

01:24:50.442 --> 01:24:51.743
- What?
- They're gonna run a feature

01:24:51.777 --> 01:24:53.511
- on us!
- Oh my God!

01:24:53.545 --> 01:24:54.712
Oh my God, that's amazing.

01:24:54.746 --> 01:24:56.547
Matthew,
have you got any brandy?

01:24:56.581 --> 01:24:57.548
- Yes.
- Quick.

01:24:57.582 --> 01:24:59.017
Oh my God.

01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:01.587
- After all this!
- Adored them!

01:25:01.619 --> 01:25:03.889
- Well, that's all...
- Well done, you.

01:25:03.921 --> 01:25:05.590
That's amazing.

01:25:05.623 --> 01:25:06.591
Whoa.

01:25:06.625 --> 01:25:07.693
So you're happy with that?

01:25:14.632 --> 01:25:16.033
Why don't you put yours
the other side.

01:25:16.067 --> 01:25:18.403
And um...

01:25:18.435 --> 01:25:20.204
- Actually, um...
- Yes.

01:25:20.238 --> 01:25:21.273
Clarissa, can we...

01:25:24.141 --> 01:25:26.144
Okay, how we looking?

01:25:27.746 --> 01:25:28.814
You're gonna sit.

01:25:28.846 --> 01:25:31.082
Here, there, now sit here.

01:25:31.115 --> 01:25:32.583
- Okay, get them together.
- Are you ready?

01:25:33.952 --> 01:25:35.654
Okay, come on.

01:25:35.686 --> 01:25:37.890
- Okay, final checks.
- Yeah.

01:25:37.922 --> 01:25:39.358
Good.

01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:41.359
You've gotta be
in the front row.

01:25:41.393 --> 01:25:42.627
- Sorry.
- Come on together, please.

01:25:42.661 --> 01:25:44.829
Yeah, that's good.

01:25:44.863 --> 01:25:46.365
- Okay.
- Ready.

01:25:46.398 --> 01:25:47.900
- Smile.
- Okay.

01:25:47.932 --> 01:25:49.100
- Okay, great.
- Here we are.

01:25:49.134 --> 01:25:50.301
- Front page.
- Well done.

01:25:50.335 --> 01:25:51.336
Well done, we've done it.

01:25:51.368 --> 01:25:52.703
- Thank you.
- Smile.

01:25:55.239 --> 01:25:56.876
Hmm.

01:26:02.747 --> 01:26:04.082
One more time.

01:26:04.114 --> 01:26:06.284
Sarah would love this,
wouldn't she?

01:26:06.318 --> 01:26:07.418
She really would.

01:26:07.452 --> 01:26:08.520
- She would.
- I know she would.

01:26:08.552 --> 01:26:10.255
- Smiling.
- Thank you.

01:26:10.287 --> 01:26:12.657
Last one.

01:28:40.738 --> 01:28:43.240
"My dearest Sarah,

01:28:43.274 --> 01:28:46.278
I'm sorry we haven't spoken
for so long.

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:50.982
I've been dreadfully stubborn
and for that I'm not proud.

01:28:51.015 --> 01:28:55.720
Of course, I'll support you
in whatever you need.

01:28:55.753 --> 01:28:56.954
Perhaps,
we could meet up soon

01:28:56.988 --> 01:28:59.157
and discuss
your brilliant bakery.

01:28:59.189 --> 01:29:00.891
I'd like that.

01:29:00.925 --> 01:29:03.462
It's time we spoke again.

01:29:03.494 --> 01:29:05.997
All my love, Mum."

01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:52.938
Is anyone else hungry?

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:54.906
Starving.

01:31:44.855 --> 01:31:46.690
- Oh my God!
- Mimi.

01:31:46.724 --> 01:31:47.926
Oh, um.

01:31:52.963 --> 01:31:54.166
You want them, you want them?

01:31:54.198 --> 01:31:55.266
Hi...

01:32:00.337 --> 01:32:01.438
Hi, sorry, two more ticks.

01:32:01.471 --> 01:32:03.641
Just... sorry, sorry,
two more seconds.

01:32:03.675 --> 01:32:05.177
- Need a hand?
- Yes.

01:32:05.210 --> 01:32:06.877
Um, can I please have...

01:32:06.911 --> 01:32:08.246
One cappuccino
and two flat whites?

01:32:08.279 --> 01:32:09.548
One cappuccino
and two flat whites.

01:32:09.581 --> 01:32:11.349
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry.

01:32:11.381 --> 01:32:12.583
Yes, madam, what can I get you?

01:33:59.355 --> 01:34:04.355
