01:07.650 --> 01:09.611
Can we get that magic mirror working?

01:10.153 --> 01:13.907
I think so.
But I can't do two things at once here.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.700
I know some Chaldaic.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.829
I know how to operate a distance mirror.
Which shall I do?

01:24.709 --> 01:26.503
I can't do either of those things.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.255
Come on, Belmont. Time to choose.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.134
You're either the last son
of a warrior dynasty or a lucky drunk.

01:33.676 --> 01:34.511
Which is it?

01:44.145 --> 01:46.439
Okay. Get the mirror working, Alucard.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.734
Give me force numbers, species,
and weapons count.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.653
Sypha stays on her job for now.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.614
I'll fortify the point of entry.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.043
I think we're going to see
the size and disposition

02:07.127 --> 02:09.879
of the attacking force fairly quickly
with our own eyes.

02:10.213 --> 02:13.174
I'm forced to agree.
Do you have a further suggestion?

02:13.591 --> 02:17.428
-Are you asking my advice?
-We're working together, Alucard.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.139
You're still a bastard,

02:19.430 --> 02:22.684
but you're the bastard I chose
to fight alongside back in Gresit.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.727
Do you have a problem with any of that?

02:27.313 --> 02:28.481
None at all.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.941
So, what do you suggest?

02:31.651 --> 02:34.195
Using this to find Dracula's castle. Now.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.908
We're trapped in a box down here.
We will eventually be overwhelmed.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.162
Unless we change the nature of the battle.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.790
Agreed. Sypha.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.917
I'm close to getting it.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.087
-I'll protect you for as long as I can.
-I know.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.645
There you are.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.170
Braila.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.050
Just to keep the peace
between squabbling creatures

05:01.134 --> 05:04.178
who will starve and die
before the end of the year anyway.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.141
Oh, well.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.811
So long as it brings silence.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.362
To Braila, then.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.132
Oh, for God's sake.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.015
Bless the river, Bishop.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.434
Make the water holy.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.874
Firedrake. Just what I need
in an underground hold full of paper.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.974
Probably just as well I didn't get to play
with the whip when I was a kid.

11:44.912 --> 11:49.291
When you get back to whatever steaming
underworld shithole you came from,

11:49.375 --> 11:52.461
you tell them
there are still Belmonts up here.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.341
You're an evil-looking bastard,
aren't you?

13:21.425 --> 13:24.512
Well, I'm armed...

13:25.804 --> 13:26.680
...with a stick.

13:28.265 --> 13:31.894
So, I'll understand
if you want to run away now.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.066
-Move.
-What?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.778
-You're coming with me.
-Why?

14:23.737 --> 14:27.575
You made your choice, Hector.
You can't go back to the castle now.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.827
You betrayed the old man.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.496
I... I...

14:32.997 --> 14:34.456
My God.

14:34.957 --> 14:39.003
You're still the baby who had
his woodland animal corpses taken away.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.673
Isaac is still the indigent boy
getting beaten in the streets.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.634
And Dracula is destroying the world
in a tantrum

14:45.759 --> 14:47.887
because someone killed his pet breeder.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.931
You're all nothing but man-children.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.392
Get across the bridge.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.604
You're mine now, forgemaster.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.150
You have nothing left but me.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.186
That's it.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.671
Do you see the castle?

16:04.838 --> 16:06.006
Take a look.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.219
Good. Keep focused on it.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.013
I have to be able to see it
to put my intent on it.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.225
-Your intent?
-That's all magic is, Alucard.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.144
Changing things in accordance
with my intent.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.148
And my intent
is to drag that grotesque thing here.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.057
-Dracula.
-Did we meet resistance at Braila?

18:20.140 --> 18:21.725
We are betrayed at Braila.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.477
I do not recognize their colors,

18:23.560 --> 18:25.604
but the castle is invaded
by vampire soldiers.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.606
What colors do they wear?

18:27.689 --> 18:29.191
Black, with white trim.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.902
That is the livery of Styria.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.446
Carmilla has made her move.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.157
What was that?

18:37.491 --> 18:40.285
I'm... not sure.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.830
Do we have anyone left loyal to us?

18:42.913 --> 18:45.165
There is a pitched battle
in the main hall.

18:45.582 --> 18:49.211
I gathered about a dozen more
on my way up there. They're outside.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.088
Then we go downstairs, Isaac.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.298
Nobody takes my castle from me.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.072
It's fighting me.

19:17.489 --> 19:22.619
It's like I'm pulling against an anchor
and a water wheel all at once.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.082
He moves the castle using an engine.
That's what's acting against you.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.091
Shit.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.781
Wait.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.663
Magic.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.175
Do as you're told.

21:49.057 --> 21:51.059
What the fuck just happened?

22:25.844 --> 22:26.887
I did it.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.687
Where did you land the castle, Sypha?

22:35.771 --> 22:37.355
Right on top of us.

22:42.944 --> 22:46.740
Yes. I landed it on the surface,
right above this underground space

22:46.823 --> 22:49.326
that's probably only held up
by wood and dirt.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.412
Let's go.
