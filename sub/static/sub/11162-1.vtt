Negotiates my wedding,
I was scared. - Why?

33:53.407 --> 33:56.285
I once got a picture of you
seen and thought

33:56.527 --> 33:59.405
a man with a
so impressive mustache

33:59.647 --> 34:03.037
Domestic tyrant is sure of myself

I found you so fashionable

34:14.087 --> 34:17.523

And you did it all weighed?

34:22.927 --> 34:25.760

of the Lord and for Kumar Sharma.

34:29.847 --> 34:32.918

Did I not say

34:33.167 --> 34:36.398

Not lift heavy things?

34:45.367 --> 34:48.165

Bought by Maharana Pratap.

34:48.407 --> 34:50.159
What for? - It's like this:

34:50.407 --> 34:53.205
The face,
that an expectant mother

34:53.447 --> 34:56.324
most look,
is the same baby!

34:56.567 --> 35:00.958
If we picture this

Maharana Pratap like!

35:04.687 --> 35:06.439
Are you crazy?

If the child
Maharana Pratap of device,

35:09.687 --> 35:12.440
It spends its life in the forest,
with a spear in his hand.

35:12.687 --> 35:15.485
We should ensure
that is, a cricket player.

35:15.727 --> 35:17.319
A cricket player!

35:17.567 --> 35:20.365
The only trouble but gets
manipulated for games!

36:00.927 --> 36:02.679
So, dear?

36:13.367 --> 36:15.323

38:46.167 --> 38:48.965

39:13.847 --> 39:17.840
What is this?
- Have you no eyes in your head?

39:19.487 --> 39:21.079
Get out!

39:21.327 --> 39:25.479
You lousy traitor!
We had a deal!

39:25.847 --> 39:28.725
What should I do?
Yes let me no rest!

39:28.967 --> 39:32.164
What does that mean? Did you want
about manipulating the game?

39:32.407 --> 39:34.159
I call the Sports Ministry!

39:34.407 --> 39:36.716
I'm tired!

39:36.967 --> 39:39.640
I'm on it! - Let's go!

39:39.887 --> 39:41.639
Here you go, ma'am. - Thank you ...

39:49.247 --> 39:51.203
Can hardly hold the racket,

39:51.447 --> 39:54.166
but Tendulkars image
wants to hang them!

39:54.407 --> 39:57.558
Now I beat a six!
- A six she wants ...

40:18.167 --> 40:19.202
Daughter!

40:47.087 --> 40:48.884
I do not understand.

40:49.127 --> 40:50.958
Over 2 hours of it is in there,

40:51.207 --> 40:53.767
why none of us says,
as it stands?

40:54.007 --> 40:57.522
Balraj's been in there forever,
why he does not come out?

41:04.007 --> 41:06.999
What happened, Uncle Balraj?
- Are you all right?

41:08.207 --> 41:10.198
She had a miscarriage.

41:11.887 --> 41:13.718
The baby died.

41:17.567 --> 41:20.843
Priya's fine.
She is out of danger.

41:21.087 --> 41:22.839
Thank God!

41:23.087 --> 41:25.999
Our daughter
has been saved!

41:26.247 --> 41:27.999
May we see Priya?

41:28.247 --> 41:31.045
No, she has
get a sedative.

41:31.287 --> 41:34.085
We should the next 7
not interfere, or 8 hours.

41:34.327 --> 41:37.125
I suggest taking
we go home.

41:37.367 --> 41:40.165
We all need some rest
after the accident.

41:40.407 --> 41:43.683
We go.
- Just go, I'll wait here.

41:43.927 --> 41:47.363
No, Auntie.
We're staying here.

41:47.607 --> 41:50.599
Mother, I'm staying here.
- But ...

41:50.847 --> 41:54.203
Priya once again to be
has come, I'll call you.

41:54.447 --> 41:57.200
Right. Let's go ...

42:02.887 --> 42:05.879
It's a big shock
for a mother

42:06.127 --> 42:08.402
to lose her baby.

42:10.607 --> 42:13.075
Take care of Priya!

42:13.327 --> 42:15.283
Yes, Grandfather ...

43:04.887 --> 43:08.675
Mr. Malhotra? Dr. Balraj
want to talk to you.

43:09.687 --> 43:11.598
I'll be right back.

43:15.087 --> 43:16.964
Sit down, Raj.

43:21.687 --> 43:24.645
I told you earlier
hiding something.

43:24.887 --> 43:25.956
What?

43:27.087 --> 43:30.079
Priya's womb
was injured in the accident

43:30.327 --> 43:32.636
and it is inflamed.

43:32.887 --> 43:35.879
A spillover
the infection to avoid

43:36.127 --> 43:39.676
had uterine
and ovaries are removed.

43:40.807 --> 43:43.799
Priya will be no more children
can get.

43:48.087 --> 43:52.842
Even the latest technology
can not change that.

43:59.087 --> 44:03.080
You may give anyone
tell your family!

44:03.327 --> 44:07.115
Especially your grandfather
must not know!

44:07.367 --> 44:09.756
He had two lnfarkte:

44:10.007 --> 44:13.397
A third
he would not survive!

44:20.167 --> 44:22.203
May I tell Priya?

45:07.967 --> 45:11.164
To our loved ones at home
to avoid unnecessary tears,

45:11.407 --> 45:13.875
we may not even shed!

45:16.687 --> 45:18.484
Can we go?

45:29.887 --> 45:32.447
The kids are here!

45:32.687 --> 45:35.440
I do not want to cry
see or show compassion!

45:35.687 --> 45:38.759
Behave as if nothing
happen! Got? - Good.

45:39.007 --> 45:40.963
Back to your work!

45:41.207 --> 45:44.119
Welcome, kids!
You are healthy again, dear!

45:44.367 --> 45:47.837
As soon as I think of you,
already the door you come in!

45:48.087 --> 45:49.964
High you should live!

45:50.207 --> 45:53.563
You'll see next year
you get a kid again!

46:02.687 --> 46:07.203
All the best! With sons
thou shalt be blessed!

46:12.887 --> 46:15.117
Well, come on ... No, Priya,

46:16.287 --> 46:18.243
You must not cry yet!

46:18.487 --> 46:22.036
Why mourn over something
was not even born?

46:22.287 --> 46:26.121
Listen now to cry on!
- Miscarriages are common,

46:26.367 --> 46:31.361
a friend had a
and now she has four kids!

46:31.607 --> 46:34.360
Four children,
in our population explosion?

46:34.607 --> 46:37.360
Pappu, they'll show with your friends
to the police!

46:37.607 --> 46:40.565
I better call the same
the Minister of Family Planning

46:40.807 --> 46:44.436
and let them ... - Forget it:
She is married to him!

46:44.687 --> 46:47.440
Better call the Premier!
- Where can I find the now?

46:47.687 --> 46:50.884
Stops laughing. I can even
Bill Clinton call!

46:51.127 --> 46:55.120
Not chatted much
and you prefer to take care Priya!

46:55.367 --> 46:58.439
It was just
discharged from the hospital!

46:58.687 --> 47:01.884
Yes, you rest a little, love,
I cook you something fine.

47:02.127 --> 47:03.879
Pappu, get their luggage!

47:04.127 --> 47:06.925
Were not you going to the office?
- I'm already gone!

47:07.167 --> 47:10.079
Go to your room
and lie down a little.

47:10.327 --> 47:12.283
Raj, they accompany.

47:39.687 --> 47:41.439
What did you do?

47:42.047 --> 47:45.244
Do you have the hope
not seen in their eyes?

47:45.487 --> 47:50.686
They hope that I
give birth to an heir of the family.

47:50.927 --> 47:54.715
One day they will learn
that we have lied to her,

47:54.967 --> 47:56.719
and then what is?

47:56.967 --> 47:59.765
Do not worry,
I have an idea.

48:00.007 --> 48:04.125
Tell me what you think.
Let us adopt a baby.

48:05.967 --> 48:07.719
My father wants to anyway,

48:07.967 --> 48:11.596
I am at our shops
care abroad.

48:11.847 --> 48:14.600
We could for a few years
go abroad

48:14.847 --> 48:17.645
and there adopt a child.

48:17.887 --> 48:20.685
What do you think? I could
regulate with Dr. Balraj.

48:24.807 --> 48:27.002
We have no other choice!

48:42.687 --> 48:44.439
Grandfather ...

48:47.847 --> 48:49.599
Come on, dear.

48:49.847 --> 48:53.078
I greet you.
- I bless you. Sit down!

48:54.927 --> 48:57.680
Did you cry? - No,

48:57.927 --> 49:01.761
these are tears of joy.
I'm asleep

49:02.007 --> 49:04.805
and had
a wonderful dream

49:05.047 --> 49:07.277
I have become a grandfather!

49:07.527 --> 49:11.964
I dreamed of a small child
sitting on my lap.

49:12.207 --> 49:15.358
It does
and laughs at me here.

49:15.607 --> 49:17.598
It looks like Raj

49:17.847 --> 49:20.725
The same eyes,
the same smile ...

49:20.967 --> 49:23.356
I leaned down to him

49:23.607 --> 49:27.282
and then grabbed the little rascals
after my mustache.

49:27.527 --> 49:30.564
I could see my tears of joy
do not hold back.

49:30.807 --> 49:34.846
These dreams in the early morning
be always true, dear.

49:53.487 --> 49:55.239
Thank you, my darling.

49:57.087 --> 50:00.477
If you meet me one wish,
if I ask you?

50:00.727 --> 50:03.685
Whatever you want,
your wish is my command.

50:07.487 --> 50:11.878
What if I do something away
want to give that belongs to me?

50:14.167 --> 50:17.079
Give it away, what's the problem?

50:20.087 --> 50:22.078
Once married.

50:23.767 --> 50:25.166
What?

50:25.407 --> 50:28.160
Grandfather had a dream today.

50:28.407 --> 50:31.365
From a small Raj
the looked exactly like you

50:31.607 --> 50:35.282
He wants your flesh and blood,
not that of anyone else.

50:35.527 --> 50:39.600
How can we an adopted
Child call our own,

50:39.847 --> 50:41.678
without violating his soul?

50:43.167 --> 50:45.965
I'm the one who is missing something
I'm infertile,

50:46.207 --> 50:48.004
but you can have a child.

50:49.687 --> 50:52.326
Raj, I beg you ...

50:54.487 --> 50:58.526
If me the same misfortune
happened to be like you,

50:58.767 --> 51:01.679
you would have about
married again?

51:04.007 --> 51:05.759
Well, come on ...

51:18.047 --> 51:21.039
All will be well again.
I love you!

51:45.407 --> 51:48.399
Yes, Priya?
- I have to meet you now!

51:48.647 --> 51:50.399
What happened?

51:50.647 --> 51:54.003
Not on the phone.
Get me off at the gate of lndia.

51:54.247 --> 51:55.885
Well, I'm coming over.

52:05.407 --> 52:08.205
Why have you called me?
- Read this article!

52:10.487 --> 52:11.761
Surrogate mother ...

52:13.447 --> 52:16.917
She was barren, as
but I, and had a baby.

52:17.167 --> 52:20.477
There was only one other
Uterus discharged.

52:20.727 --> 52:23.480
You want a test-tube baby?
- No!

52:23.727 --> 52:26.525
With our well-known family
would be immediately in the press.

52:26.767 --> 52:29.565
So you want me to ...?
- Yes.

52:29.807 --> 52:33.197
Let us find a woman
who wants to unsubscribe our child.

52:35.567 --> 52:39.003
Listen, when I was a kid
wanted to have someone else

52:39.247 --> 52:43.126
I would have married again
and any proposed adoption.

52:43.367 --> 52:46.837
I want my love for you
do not share with anyone.

52:48.207 --> 52:51.005
Grief is free,
but fortune has its price.

52:51.247 --> 52:54.159
For the happiness of our child
I'm even willing to

52:54.407 --> 52:57.205
your love with love
another woman to share.

52:57.447 --> 53:00.280
Even if I would agree:

53:00.527 --> 53:02.961
Where do we find such a woman?

53:03.207 --> 53:07.086
When I am set for the mother,
We certainly find one.

53:12.167 --> 53:13.919
Hello, you look good!

53:19.087 --> 53:23.080

53:29.567 --> 53:32.400

They are so absent!

53:32.647 --> 53:36.083
No, Ms. Bharucha, set

53:38.327 --> 53:41.080

their problem is off the table!

53:41.327 --> 53:44.524
Unfortunately, this does not,

53:44.767 --> 53:48.646
What? - Yes, a friend of mine
looking for a girl.

53:48.887 --> 53:51.765
Really?
He looks as good as you?

53:52.007 --> 53:54.805
Yes, and he is also rich,
He would give anything

53:55.047 --> 53:56.799
a mansion, a car, anything.

All he wants is a child.

That's the problem:

54:07.927 --> 54:10.805
He is already married
and does not want to marry again.

54:11.047 --> 54:12.878
What? An illegitimate child?

54:13.127 --> 54:16.005
Would that be a problem?
- And if it would be!

54:16.247 --> 54:19.159
You keep me well

55:38.887 --> 55:43.563
Raj Kapoor woman you

55:43.807 --> 55:47.516
I wanted to know which product
We first launch.

55:48.287 --> 55:51.438
I'm sorry,
I was thinking ...

55:51.687 --> 55:54.838
Can we fix the next week?
- No Problem!

55:55.087 --> 55:57.965
You know, I miss my wife

55:58.207 --> 56:01.085
Excuse me,

56:47.287 --> 56:50.279
You live here?
But here is no house.

56:50.527 --> 56:55.157
Why a house? Turn off the lights
and already beginning to!

56:55.407 --> 56:58.365
What? - In the car with air conditioning
but makes it really fun!

56:58.607 --> 57:01.360
I participating in 1000

57:01.607 --> 57:04.360
For you I'll do it but
something cheaper. Come on!

57:04.607 --> 57:06.438
You get me wrong.

57:06.687 --> 57:10.362
I just wanted to go home.
- What is this?

57:10.607 --> 57:12.359
I mean ...

57:12.607 --> 57:14.484

57:14.727 --> 57:19.005
A friend wants a girl
for a whole year.

57:19.247 --> 57:21.556
A whole year?

57:21.807 --> 57:24.924
You little devil! And
you see from so innocent!

57:26.207 --> 57:29.961
It's not about your friend,
but to you, right?

57:30.607 --> 57:31.801
Yes.

57:32.047 --> 57:35.244
Check out
I have two children to feed.

57:35.487 --> 57:38.399
You have no father,
taking care of them!

57:38.647 --> 57:41.639
I'm not the one.
But there's a girl;

57:41.887 --> 57:43.923
she dances in the Deepah bar.

57:44.167 --> 57:48.126
The times you could ask.
It is Madhubala.

57:48.367 --> 57:50.198
I call her times. - Thank you.

57:50.607 --> 57:52.359
Take it, please.

57:52.607 --> 57:55.360

59:28.327 --> 59:30.522
Come here to me!

59:30.767 --> 59:34.282
Crazy, crazy
All are crazy about me

01:00:34.447 --> 01:00:36.403
Look, the guy there!

01:00:37.687 --> 01:00:40.963
Well, honey, how about the two of us?
- No, rather not ...

01:00:42.487 --> 01:00:45.843
Do not be afraid,
my dear friend,

01:00:46.087 --> 01:00:50.160
and closing off trade

01:00:50.687 --> 01:00:54.123
I do not return from the body,

01:00:54.367 --> 01:00:57.837
my life is yours

01:00:59.087 --> 01:01:01.043
Beautiful moments

01:01:01.287 --> 01:01:03.243
a good heart

01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:05.762
and this beautiful body

01:01:06.007 --> 01:01:09.920
I no longer let you
free from my embrace

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.919
Why everyone says:

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:13.964
Come here to me!

01:01:37.887 --> 01:01:40.720
Come on, dance for us

01:01:45.927 --> 01:01:48.646
Madhubala, come here to me!

01:02:02.047 --> 01:02:05.676
Secretly you came,
my favorite

01:02:05.927 --> 01:02:10.318
I would like to know,
what did you bring me

01:02:10.567 --> 01:02:13.718
Where do you want to just go?

01:02:13.967 --> 01:02:17.562
With me you'll find it all
what you need

01:02:17.807 --> 01:02:19.559
My charm,

01:02:19.807 --> 01:02:21.559
Fun,

01:02:21.807 --> 01:02:23.525
Love

01:02:23.767 --> 01:02:25.519
and passion

01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:29.436
With my beauty
I do all in love with me!

01:02:29.687 --> 01:02:33.475
And all say:
Come here to me!

01:03:07.487 --> 01:03:09.478
Give me the money!

01:03:09.727 --> 01:03:12.605
That was much more!
Where's the rest?
708,
01:03:12,847 -> 01:03:15,964
What a rest? - Give it to me!
- Do not touch me!

01:03:12.847 --> 01:03:15.964
What a rest? - Give it to me!
- Do not touch me!

01:03:16.207 --> 01:03:19.085
Give already here!
-There you go.

01:03:21.127 --> 01:03:23.800
Here's your share!

01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:30.164
Meena, leave him alone!

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:34.241
Anyway, who is
wie'n cold fish! Come on, let's go.

01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:43.557
Vyjayanti has already told me
that you were coming. What is it?

01:03:43.807 --> 01:03:45.763
Did she not say the wages sent?

01:03:46.007 --> 01:03:49.477
Madhubala! How about the two of us?
- Piss off, you wretch!

01:03:49.727 --> 01:03:52.560
What's gone to your head?
- Get out!

01:03:54.447 --> 01:03:56.199
Go on.

01:03:56.447 --> 01:04:01.282
Not here.
Can we talk about this somewhere else?

01:04:01.527 --> 01:04:04.564
No problem,
but then it is a bit more expensive!

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:08.436
Right. - Let's go.

01:04:13.007 --> 01:04:15.760
Come on!
- What have you brought me here?

01:04:16.007 --> 01:04:18.885
In the slums are the rooms
but much cheaper!

01:04:19.127 --> 01:04:22.915
Towel, soap and even beer
are included in the price.

01:04:23.167 --> 01:04:24.919
I got a room here, come on.

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:27.965
Looks
than today were my lucky day!

01:04:31.847 --> 01:04:34.839
Go talk to the elevator,
I'll get the keys quickly.

01:04:36.327 --> 01:04:38.079
Good evening.

01:04:38.327 --> 01:04:41.125
These darn sandal ...

01:04:42.647 --> 01:04:46.003
Hey, fatso!
What's there to laugh about?

01:04:46.247 --> 01:04:47.999
It is the same thing!

01:04:48.247 --> 01:04:51.000
We go?
- Good evening, sir!

01:04:51.247 --> 01:04:55.240
Give the merely because no tip!
- Your wife is too generous!

01:04:55.487 --> 01:04:58.604
A sly fox, how?
Give it to him already.

01:04:58.847 --> 01:05:01.600
Here you are. - Thank you!

01:05:01.847 --> 01:05:04.839
Half of it is for me, okay?
- Come ...

01:05:15.927 --> 01:05:17.838
What a great room!

01:05:18.087 --> 01:05:21.762
I've already
part of large hotel rooms,

01:05:22.007 --> 01:05:26.523
but this beats everything.
It even has a TV!

01:05:27.087 --> 01:05:30.124
Heard of it?
- No, the hotel.

01:05:30.367 --> 01:05:32.164
Do you see anything?

01:05:34.087 --> 01:05:36.078
Is that a cell phone?

01:05:36.327 --> 01:05:38.682
No, the remote control.

01:05:57.247 --> 01:06:00.125
Oh, that I had
now almost forgotten!

01:06:00.367 --> 01:06:02.164
That is not required.

01:06:02.407 --> 01:06:04.204
Why? Did you not like?

01:06:04.447 --> 01:06:07.245
No, first I would like to
talk to you.

01:06:07.487 --> 01:06:10.445
This will cost you but
twice!

01:06:11.207 --> 01:06:13.198
Just kidding ...

01:06:14.727 --> 01:06:17.116
Come, sit down!

01:06:17.367 --> 01:06:19.323
There is nothing to negotiate.

01:06:19.567 --> 01:06:22.684
I usually take
700 or 800 rupees.

01:06:22.927 --> 01:06:25.680
But you've got me here
brought in this amazing place,

01:06:25.927 --> 01:06:28.680
're nice
and still look good.

01:06:28.927 --> 01:06:30.679
For you it costs 1000th

01:06:31.047 --> 01:06:35.438
You tell me
what you want for a week!

01:06:35.687 --> 01:06:37.120
3000!

01:06:37.367 --> 01:06:39.164
And for a whole month?

01:06:39.407 --> 01:06:41.682
Do you ask me so much?

01:06:44.447 --> 01:06:48.440
I find you not bad.
Okay, 15,000 rupees!

01:06:48.687 --> 01:06:50.678
What do you want for a year?

01:06:50.927 --> 01:06:54.317
A year? This is long.
So far I can not count.

01:06:54.567 --> 01:06:58.845
Let's see ...
Hundred thousand!

01:07:06.007 --> 01:07:07.804
How much is it?

01:07:08.447 --> 01:07:10.244
200,000.

01:07:11.447 --> 01:07:13.199
200,000?

01:07:15.447 --> 01:07:18.439
I've never in life
seen so much money!

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.919
But I do not do anything perverted!

01:07:23.167 --> 01:07:25.886
I should not but about
star in a porn?

01:07:26.127 --> 01:07:27.879
Do not worry.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:31.119
I'm married
and I love my wife.

01:07:31.367 --> 01:07:33.961
Yes, I see!

01:07:34.207 --> 01:07:37.005
We have everything we want,

01:07:37.247 --> 01:07:40.603
only a child still missing,
and that I want from you.

01:07:40.847 --> 01:07:42.883
One child, why?

01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:46.642
Can your wife because
have any children?

01:07:51.607 --> 01:07:55.600
Now tell already!
What do you really want from me?

01:07:57.327 --> 01:07:59.477
I want a child from you!

01:08:01.007 --> 01:08:03.760
And I'm ready
you have to pay for any amount!

01:08:04.007 --> 01:08:06.123
And what do I get for it?

01:08:06.367 --> 01:08:08.517
500,000, a million ...

01:08:12.927 --> 01:08:15.202
A million! - Are you okay?

01:08:15.687 --> 01:08:17.996
A million! - What is ...?

01:08:19.087 --> 01:08:20.884
I'll give you my baby

01:08:21.127 --> 01:08:24.118
and for that I get from you
'Ne whole million?

01:08:24.886 --> 01:08:28.243
You will not let me hopefully
sit when I'm pregnant.

01:08:28.487 --> 01:08:30.283
I can pay you immediately.

01:08:30.527 --> 01:08:33.917
No, I trust you.
But what will people say,

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:37.557
when a whore for your wife
a child should bring to the world?

01:08:37.807 --> 01:08:41.082
Nothing, because no one ever
will learn something from it.

01:08:41.327 --> 01:08:44.238
You want to
So keep it secret!

01:08:45.006 --> 01:08:47.999
My easy money!
Incredible!

01:08:48.327 --> 01:08:51.716
All the years I have been working,
to fill my belly

01:08:51.966 --> 01:08:54.959
and now my stomach is working
for me!

01:08:55.687 --> 01:08:59.362
But there is one thing
you should know:

01:08:59.607 --> 01:09:04.362
I never kiss someone
on the mouth! Okay?

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:06.518
A million! ...

01:09:12.886 --> 01:09:15.321
Nice that you called!

01:09:15.567 --> 01:09:18.286
I've found a girl,

01:09:18.527 --> 01:09:22.917
which will host a child for us.
- Really?

01:09:23.167 --> 01:09:24.645
Yes.

01:09:26.687 --> 01:09:31.807
You must be an angel,
if it is so helpful.

01:09:32.046 --> 01:09:34.002
A million! ...

01:09:36.287 --> 01:09:39.245
She's been nice, but ...

01:09:39.487 --> 01:09:44.435
She is determined from a
poor family? - Well, yes ...

01:09:44.687 --> 01:09:48.202
There's enough out completely,
if it is decent.

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.238
My easy money!

01:09:53.487 --> 01:09:55.955
I love you. - I you too.

01:10:04.207 --> 01:10:06.960
Buy yourself tomorrow
something nice to wear.

01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:08.959
Here you have 50,000.

01:10:09.207 --> 01:10:12.005
Buy yourself something
that your body is not so stressed!

01:10:12.247 --> 01:10:15.000
Why?
You do not like about my body?

01:10:15.247 --> 01:10:18.000
However, it is beautiful,
but you think he is better covered!

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.999
Oh well. - Tell your people,

01:10:20.247 --> 01:10:23.080
you next year
spend with me.

01:10:23.327 --> 01:10:26.125
I have no one.
From now on I'm just here for you!

01:10:26.687 --> 01:10:30.396
Now go to sleep!
- Come on, I'm ready!

01:10:30.647 --> 01:10:33.400
No! You sleep here.
I sleep over there. - What?

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:35.399
You sleep here, I over there.

01:10:35.647 --> 01:10:38.400
But I want now
I earn a million!

01:10:38.647 --> 01:10:41.445
You can later also.
Go to sleep!

01:10:41.687 --> 01:10:46.124
'm Curious
When I make my million!

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:05.996
Sorry ...

01:11:06.247 --> 01:11:09.000
What's the cost?
- This is not for you!

01:11:09.247 --> 01:11:12.045
Please speak Hindi.
- This is not for you.

01:11:12.287 --> 01:11:15.040
Why? Poorly processed?
Wrong color?

01:11:15.287 --> 01:11:17.039
It is too expensive for you.

01:11:17.287 --> 01:11:20.085
What a nonsense!
You see, I have money!

01:11:20.327 --> 01:11:22.079
Get out of here, come on!

01:11:22.327 --> 01:11:26.445
Why? I got money
and wants to buy clothes!

01:11:26.687 --> 01:11:29.884
I've told wages sent,
They should get out of here!

01:11:30.127 --> 01:11:33.278
Oh that!
LHR want kidding me?

01:11:33.527 --> 01:11:35.563
Do you think I want to steal?

01:11:35.807 --> 01:11:38.560
I could
Buy the whole store here!

01:11:38.807 --> 01:11:41.640
I want wages sent but
sell anything!

01:11:41.887 --> 01:11:44.685
This store is decent
People. Out now!

01:11:44.927 --> 01:11:47.964
Old bag! Decent people
probably have other money.

01:11:48.207 --> 01:11:51.677
Security guard! - To place!
- Touch me not!

01:11:51.927 --> 01:11:54.680
Do you think
I want to steal it?

01:11:54.927 --> 01:11:57.646
Old man
that you will hear of this!

01:11:57.887 --> 01:11:59.639
Thus, a large shop,

01:11:59.887 --> 01:12:02.879
but manners as the last
Barker! Scoundrel!

01:12:03.127 --> 01:12:07.359
Out of the way!
Let me through!

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:13.319
Just throw me out!
Just because I'm running around different!

01:12:13.567 --> 01:12:16.081
Sorry. - What is?
- Where are you going?

01:12:16.327 --> 01:12:17.919
High, why?

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.965
I'm the manager of this hotel.
To whom do you want?

01:12:21.207 --> 01:12:23.960
To my boss.
- And who would that be?

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:26.198
The one with the big
brown eyes,

01:12:26.447 --> 01:12:29.962
with which I arrived here yesterday.
His room is upstairs.

01:12:30.207 --> 01:12:31.959
Room number? - I do not know.

01:12:32.207 --> 01:12:33.959
The rooms with a sea view!

01:12:34.207 --> 01:12:36.960
We have a lot of room
with sea view, good woman.

01:12:37.207 --> 01:12:38.959
Come, I'll show's wages sent!

01:12:39.207 --> 01:12:41.960
Sorry, you can not
upwards. - Are you trouble?

01:12:42.207 --> 01:12:45.165
If my boss finds,
you fly, old baldy!

01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:48.285
Women like you
are undesirable in the hotel!

01:12:48.527 --> 01:12:50.643
Let go of me! - Get out!

01:12:52.487 --> 01:12:55.285
Hey, fatso! Come here!
That one knows me!

01:12:55.527 --> 01:12:58.280
Say this pumpkin head that you
know me! - You know her?

01:12:58.527 --> 01:13:01.280
Of course he knows me!
He brought me to the top!

01:13:02.607 --> 01:13:05.565
She came with Raj Malhotra.
- Raj Malhotra? Sorry,

01:13:05.807 --> 01:13:08.879
last night
I was not on duty.

01:13:09.127 --> 01:13:12.756
This explains
the small Mißverständis.

01:13:13.007 --> 01:13:17.285
I hope you forgive me
my little faux pas

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:21.202
Mr Raj and tell about it!
- Who the hell is this?

01:13:21.447 --> 01:13:24.200
Raj Malhotra. The one with whom you
arrived here yesterday.

01:13:24.447 --> 01:13:29.077
Oh, yeah? Now at least I know
his name.

01:13:30.247 --> 01:13:33.045
What do you want with high?
- No, no ...

01:13:33.287 --> 01:13:36.040
Well, then go ...
Where is my sweet well?

01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:39.085
The first product
for the international market

01:13:39.327 --> 01:13:42.125
I suggest food
for expectant mothers before.

01:13:42.367 --> 01:13:45.359
My business partner,
Mr. Sharma, sells the goods

01:13:45.607 --> 01:13:47.359
through its branches in America.

01:13:47.607 --> 01:13:50.405
To him in technical matters
support,

01:13:50.647 --> 01:13:52.399

01:14:05.527 --> 01:14:07.438

You've got given me money

01:14:11.367 --> 01:14:14.325
but the stupid shopkeeper
tells me simply,

01:14:14.567 --> 01:14:17.684
he wants me as a
sell anything!

01:14:17.927 --> 01:14:20.680
Go upstairs,
I'll be right there.

01:14:20.927 --> 01:14:23.680
But I want to eat with you!

01:14:27.967 --> 01:14:29.719

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:36.440
I'm sorry, forgive me.

A friend oh so!
Little time waster, how?

She's a nice girl.

She's a professional.

01:14:57.687 --> 01:15:01.236
You are professional, I also;
we all are.

01:15:01.487 --> 01:15:03.364
Since you've actually right.

01:15:03.607 --> 01:15:05.598
Why did you come down?

01:15:05.847 --> 01:15:08.759
And why do you simply bursts
purely in my meeting?

01:15:09.007 --> 01:15:11.760
If I'm embarrassing you,
You should have what to say!

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.760
Or lock me in the bathroom!
And this stupid shopkeeper!

01:15:15.007 --> 01:15:17.760
I just like to kick out!

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:26.963
Gawk not so! Get yourself something,
when you're hungry.

01:15:27.207 --> 01:15:30.005
I'm not hungry.
Which shopkeeper?

01:15:30.247 --> 01:15:33.045
From the large shop opposite.
- What did he say?

01:15:33.287 --> 01:15:36.040
I told you so!
He insulted me.

01:15:36.287 --> 01:15:38.278
And you're no better!

01:15:38.527 --> 01:15:40.279
I did not think,

01:15:40.527 --> 01:15:43.280
that you are from another world
're from. I'm sorry.

01:15:43.527 --> 01:15:47.315
I'm not here voluntarily,
you brought me!

01:15:48.087 --> 01:15:51.079
Here you are.
- Wait a minute.

01:15:56.287 --> 01:15:59.279
Let's go!
- Where?

01:15:59.527 --> 01:16:02.644
In the store, buy clothes.
- I do not go in there!

01:16:07.287 --> 01:16:09.596
Madhubala, ma'am ...

01:16:11.327 --> 01:16:14.080
What's going on?
- For the first time in my life

01:16:14.327 --> 01:16:17.797
someone proves me respect!
- Let's go.

01:16:27.687 --> 01:16:29.484
You again?

01:16:29.727 --> 01:16:33.481
She is here with me.
- Who are you?

01:16:33.727 --> 01:16:35.718
Incredible!

01:16:37.047 --> 01:16:39.163
Mr. Malhotra, it is an honor for us

01:16:39.407 --> 01:16:42.763
In our home
to welcome you!

01:16:43.007 --> 01:16:46.204
Not me, she buys here!
- It's your companion?

01:16:46.447 --> 01:16:49.598
Jassi, Rita, Seema!
Please use the lady!

01:16:49.847 --> 01:16:51.724

01:16:51.967 --> 01:16:55.403
This way ma'am!

That you bring it your self,

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:16.115
How about this?
Like the wages sent? No?

01:17:18.287 --> 01:17:21.165
Actually I wanted to
Buy the store empty

01:17:21.407 --> 01:17:24.205
but you have nothing,
what really suits her.

01:17:24.447 --> 01:17:26.642
Do you like something here?

01:17:26.887 --> 01:17:29.276
Then we go somewhere else.

01:17:29.527 --> 01:17:30.926
I'm sorry.

01:17:31.167 --> 01:17:35.365
You're sweating? Here
so you can cool you something!

01:17:35.607 --> 01:17:39.805
Goodbye, old bag!
- Do something like this ever again!

01:17:47.687 --> 01:17:51.885
Hey! What is this?
- Smoking is unhealthy!

01:17:52.127 --> 01:17:55.915
Alcohol too!
- So a small bottle not!

01:17:56.167 --> 01:17:59.557
Eats this little bottle
a big hole in your liver!

01:18:00.087 --> 01:18:03.762
Listen: My wife must never
learn who you really are!

01:18:04.007 --> 01:18:05.406

01:18:06.487 --> 01:18:08.125

Hey! Not cutting anything off!

01:18:50.087 --> 01:18:53.079
That's not bad.
Do not worry.

01:18:56.767 --> 01:18:58.758
'' Hi Madhu! Hi Priya!''

01:18:59.007 --> 01:19:01.760
'' How you
ever thank Madhu?''

01:19:02.047 --> 01:19:03.799
'' That you do not need.

01:19:04.047 --> 01:19:06.800
As a woman I can lhren
Pain well understand.''

01:19:07.047 --> 01:19:09.800
Was that good? - Not bad,
but show yourself compassionate.

01:19:10.047 --> 01:19:12.800
Okay. When I get to know Priya?
- Tomorrow we fly,

01:19:13.047 --> 01:19:15.800
I ask you
at the airport in Delhi.

01:19:16.047 --> 01:19:18.925
Try as long as your tone
to keep something compassionate.

01:19:19.167 --> 01:19:20.919
Compassionate ...?

01:19:21.167 --> 01:19:25.160
'' Only another woman can
Their move into position.'' Better?

01:19:25.407 --> 01:19:28.365
Hurry, otherwise the flyer away.

If not, a phone call away

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:33.363
Hello, how are you?

But now

01:21:52.166 --> 01:21:53.884

01:21:54.126 --> 01:21:57.163

Then I'll take you to the car.

01:22:25.966 --> 01:22:28.844
Madhu, this is our house.
Here we will be staying.

01:22:29.086 --> 01:22:32.044

As you can hear by their teachers.

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:47.565
I did what I could.

01:22:47.806 --> 01:22:50.559
Not bad!

01:22:57.766 --> 01:22:59.518
Welcome back!

Do you like it? - And how!

01:23:06.326 --> 01:23:08.203
This is my room,

01:23:10.926 --> 01:23:12.803
and that is yours.

01:23:51.966 --> 01:23:55.561
Madam,

01:23:55.806 --> 01:23:57.762
Come, I'll help you.

Just call me'' Priya''.
- Oh no, I can not.

01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:07.999
Why? Here there is neither Mr.
another lady of the house.

01:24:09.246 --> 01:24:11.157
Thus, a large pool!

01:24:11.406 --> 01:24:14.398
And you can swim in it,
whenever you want!

01:24:14.646 --> 01:24:17.922
If you like,
we can change the room.

01:24:19.646 --> 01:24:23.355
Okay!
I'll get my luggage quickly.

01:24:24.766 --> 01:24:27.519
Madhu loves this room,
so they can have it quiet.

01:24:27.766 --> 01:24:30.644
I sleep in the guest room.
- Why not?

01:24:30.886 --> 01:24:34.435
This one we already know so,

Fruits, vegetables, clothes, shoes,
all in one shop?

01:26:22.846 --> 01:26:25.804
Yes, you calmly take what you want.

01:26:34.286 --> 01:26:36.163
Oh, brandy!

01:26:41.486 --> 01:26:44.239
'' We have your attention.

In the announcement, they have

All roads will be a long time

Raj comes to pick us up immediately.
You tell him, dass ..

That's enough for the whole year!

01:27:37.966 --> 01:27:39.718
She's gone an hour ago.

01:27:39.966 --> 01:27:42.764
What? Does it weather warning

01:27:43.006 --> 01:27:45.804
But she wanted to stay close

01:27:46.046 --> 01:27:47.798
She's probably already there.

01:27:48.046 --> 01:27:51.243
Come, bring away the shopping cart,

01:27:51.486 --> 01:27:53.283

Stay there, I'll pick you up.
- You can not.

01:28:46.286 --> 01:28:48.038
The roads are impassable.

01:28:48.286 --> 01:28:51.039
Do not worry.

Keep you always on the,

01:35:12.086 --> 01:35:14.441

01:35:39.966 --> 01:35:42.719
What's this?
- A blessed talisman.

01:35:42.966 --> 01:35:45.878
My mother gave it to me,
to protect the baby.

01:35:47.526 --> 01:35:52.520
You have to wear it always,
so that nothing happens to the baby.

01:36:29.246 --> 01:36:32.044
Why my heart is going crazy?

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:34.675
Why it beats so fast?

01:36:34.926 --> 01:36:39.716
Why I'm in love?

01:36:39.966 --> 01:36:42.355
Why is the weather so beautiful?

01:36:42.606 --> 01:36:44.961
Why does that sound anklet?

01:36:45.206 --> 01:36:49.722
What has enchanted me so?

01:36:49.966 --> 01:36:53.003
Can anyone tell me?

01:36:53.246 --> 01:36:54.838
No one knows it!

01:36:55.086 --> 01:36:57.156
I know it,

01:36:57.406 --> 01:36:59.966
you know,

01:37:00.206 --> 01:37:04.518
otherwise nobody knows

01:37:06.046 --> 01:37:10.039
In your heart,
deep in your heart,

01:37:10.286 --> 01:37:13.915
you know,
how much I love you

01:37:55.086 --> 01:38:00.285
Deep in my heart
I forbid

01:38:00.526 --> 01:38:05.475
the story of our love

01:38:05.726 --> 01:38:10.595
My precious life,
Oh beloved,

01:38:10.846 --> 01:38:15.442
I have put in your hands

01:38:15.686 --> 01:38:17.597
Why do your eyes smile?

01:38:17.846 --> 01:38:20.644
Why are you beating her
demurely down?

01:38:20.886 --> 01:38:25.562
What has Providence
brought me?

01:38:26.566 --> 01:38:28.716
Can anyone tell me?

01:38:28.966 --> 01:38:30.718
Nobody knows

01:38:30.966 --> 01:38:33.958
I know it

01:38:41.846 --> 01:38:44.883
In your heart

01:39:20.886 --> 01:39:23.195
Oh, good God,

01:39:23.446 --> 01:39:26.040
I thank you,

01:39:26.286 --> 01:39:30.677
because you my prayers
have heard

01:39:30.926 --> 01:39:35.761
My love
finally bears fruit,

01:39:36.006 --> 01:39:41.205
our dream
is finally coming true

01:39:41.446 --> 01:39:43.516
What you welded together like that?

01:39:43.766 --> 01:39:46.485
Your relationship is so strong!

01:39:46.726 --> 01:39:51.197
What a beautiful message
has brought about the weather?

01:39:51.446 --> 01:39:54.438
Can anyone tell

01:40:28.366 --> 01:40:31.119
Now I'm
in the third month

01:40:31.366 --> 01:40:33.118
and you see nothing yet!

01:40:35.206 --> 01:40:38.164
No wonder! One sees only
something from the fifth month.

01:40:38.406 --> 01:40:41.159
As I did last year
was pregnant,

01:40:41.406 --> 01:40:44.159
I was also worried
but my mother in law ...

01:40:44.406 --> 01:40:48.877
Mother in law?
Intended terrible, right?

01:40:49.126 --> 01:40:52.038
No, not mine.

01:40:52.286 --> 01:40:55.323
It is really very nice
and adores me.

01:40:55.566 --> 01:40:59.320
And Raj's grandfather loves me
as if I was his granddaughter.

01:40:59.566 --> 01:41:03.241
Who else is part of the family?
- Grandfather's friend, a doctor,

01:41:03.486 --> 01:41:05.875
an uncle, an aunt ...

01:41:06.126 --> 01:41:09.243
And then there's Pappu.
He has so many connections:

01:41:09.486 --> 01:41:12.364
If the phone breaks,
he calls a technician,

01:41:12.606 --> 01:41:15.359
but complains
directly with the telecommunications minister.

01:41:15.606 --> 01:41:19.963
Its ticks have me at first
disturbed, but he's really nice.

01:41:20.206 --> 01:41:23.164
You got definitely a lot of fun
in your family

01:41:23.406 --> 01:41:25.203
and knows no bad days.

01:41:25.966 --> 01:41:30.164
That used to me before ...

01:41:32.526 --> 01:41:36.280
But thanks to you, the good,
old days will soon return.

01:41:39.966 --> 01:41:41.115
Congratulations!

01:41:41.366 --> 01:41:44.244
Our sales to
increased about $ 10 million.

01:41:44.486 --> 01:41:48.479
This is nothing.
Soon we are at 100 million.

01:41:48.726 --> 01:41:52.514

All the best! - Thank you ...

01:43:04.166 --> 01:43:06.157
Where did you leave your wife?

01:43:06.406 --> 01:43:09.204
Tomorrow is the lnitiation

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:15.200
You gotta really come!

I think about all the time,
how do I know you!

01:43:21.726 --> 01:43:24.559
If you see yourself as,
you would never care

01:43:24.806 --> 01:43:27.036
that you're a whore!

01:43:32.246 --> 01:43:33.998
How do you know?

01:43:34.246 --> 01:43:37.875
Between me and Raj
there are no secrets.

01:43:43.806 --> 01:43:45.762
I'm also a connoisseur.

01:43:46.006 --> 01:43:49.396
If the product is good,
I do not look at the price.

01:43:49.646 --> 01:43:52.240
Times when Raj does not have time

01:43:53.366 --> 01:43:56.836
Just come to me.
I'll pay double.

01:44:12.086 --> 01:44:13.758
Excuse me ...

01:44:25.846 --> 01:44:27.598
Why did you leave?

01:44:27.846 --> 01:44:30.235
That's it, I'm going back!

01:44:30.486 --> 01:44:33.364
What happened?
Has someone offended you?

01:44:33.606 --> 01:44:35.642
LHR but are all the same!

01:44:35.886 --> 01:44:39.083
For you men
I'm just a toy!

01:44:39.326 --> 01:44:41.078
Not until you show me respect

01:44:41.326 --> 01:44:44.159
and then it is just me,
just so cold!

01:44:44.406 --> 01:44:47.557
The child I would have on the
Road can bring to the world.

01:44:47.806 --> 01:44:50.639
Why are you taking me only
in your world

01:44:50.886 --> 01:44:53.798
and then tell your friend
I'm a whore?

01:44:58.886 --> 01:45:01.844
Even when I went purchase,
I myself never

01:45:02.086 --> 01:45:03.883
felt so cheap!

01:45:04.126 --> 01:45:05.923
What Ajay said?

01:45:08.566 --> 01:45:11.319
I have no one
said a word.

01:45:11.566 --> 01:45:13.522
At that time, at the meeting ...

01:45:15.966 --> 01:45:18.036
Madhu, where are you going?

01:45:18.286 --> 01:45:21.244
Back home. He has
tells his friend, dass ..

01:45:22.926 --> 01:45:27.078
... I'm pregnant
and not allowed to dance.

01:45:29.606 --> 01:45:33.076
Raj and I are your friends
and only want your best.

01:45:33.326 --> 01:45:36.716
We would never say anything,
What could hurt you.

01:45:36.966 --> 01:45:41.357
You want to dance? Comm ..
- I'm tired ...

01:45:53.926 --> 01:45:55.882
If you love someone,

01:45:56.126 --> 01:45:58.959
are also nothings
hurtful.

01:46:01.086 --> 01:46:04.283
Priya, I have given you
about Madhu secretive.

01:46:04.526 --> 01:46:08.201
l know.
I've listened to everything.

01:46:11.726 --> 01:46:14.877
It was right
me nothing to say.

01:46:15.126 --> 01:46:19.836
Had I known it,
I would not have accepted Madhul.

01:46:20.086 --> 01:46:22.361
But today I know

01:46:22.606 --> 01:46:26.645
that no one is better suited
unsubscribe our child.

01:46:45.846 --> 01:46:47.598
How is Madhu?

01:46:48.126 --> 01:46:51.118
I was with her,
she is still offended.

01:46:51.366 --> 01:46:54.358
It would not be good if we
go to celebrate my cousins,

01:46:54.606 --> 01:46:56.358
and they will remain here alone.

01:46:56.606 --> 01:47:00.394
Then tell from our visit.
- No, Vicky would be offended.

01:47:00.646 --> 01:47:04.241
I will go there alone.
You stay here with her.

01:47:04.486 --> 01:47:07.796
I'll say you had
urgent business to do.

01:47:08.046 --> 01:47:10.640
Well, then pack it before.

01:47:10.886 --> 01:47:13.878
I then bring you to the station.

01:47:25.966 --> 01:47:28.161
Drinking a sip of juice.

01:47:38.166 --> 01:47:41.363
Cigarettes are not good for you
and the baby.

01:47:44.166 --> 01:47:47.044
Listen, I know
you're offended.

01:47:47.286 --> 01:47:49.277
But when you back in Mumbai

01:47:49.526 --> 01:47:53.519
so rigged and cheeky
burst into our meeting are ...

01:47:53.766 --> 01:47:55.518
... Ajay was there.

01:47:57.686 --> 01:47:59.483
I've Priya said nothing;

01:47:59.726 --> 01:48:02.524
why should I tell him?

01:48:05.046 --> 01:48:09.244
Now, if you're still thinking,
it was my fault ...

01:48:10.046 --> 01:48:11.843
I'm sorry.

01:48:18.086 --> 01:48:20.077
Soak your cigarette ...

01:49:07.966 --> 01:49:09.763
've Probably just bathed?

01:49:10.006 --> 01:49:11.997
Raj is not there, he is in the office.

01:49:12.246 --> 01:49:16.364
l know. He comes home late.
And Priya's with her cousin.

01:49:16.606 --> 01:49:19.120
That's why I'm here.

01:49:23.166 --> 01:49:27.045
Since this party you're going to me
not from the mind.

01:49:27.286 --> 01:49:30.278
And is now
got the right opportunity.

01:49:30.526 --> 01:49:33.518
I had already
all kinds of women,

01:49:33.766 --> 01:49:37.361
but you,
you are very special!

01:49:37.606 --> 01:49:39.597
Please, go!

01:49:39.846 --> 01:49:41.598
Oh, I understand:

01:49:41.846 --> 01:49:44.804
You have a contract with Raj.
Why are you so bitchy?

01:49:45.046 --> 01:49:47.799
Raj and I,
we understand dazzling.

01:49:48.046 --> 01:49:51.516
We are not just business partners,
but also old friends.

01:49:51.766 --> 01:49:53.836
He will not mind.

01:49:54.526 --> 01:49:56.323
Let us lose no time.

01:50:01.246 --> 01:50:05.000
You cheap whore!
You dare to strike me?

01:50:30.366 --> 01:50:33.756
The lady adorns comfortable?
I'll show you already!

01:51:15.166 --> 01:51:17.475

01:51:18.366 --> 01:51:20.482
What? That you vergewaltigst?

01:51:20.726 --> 01:51:22.444

What are you doing Raj?

01:51:29.166 --> 01:51:30.918

What? You beat me

Does it for you about

Why do you think so,

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.358
Come on, tell me!

01:51:57.366 --> 01:52:01.279
Because such a bitch you prügelst
up with an old friend?

01:52:05.646 --> 01:52:07.637
Old friend, what?

01:52:09.366 --> 01:52:12.119
Even if you were my brother,

01:52:13.166 --> 01:52:14.963
I would kill you!

01:52:18.726 --> 01:52:22.241

Partnership, only because of her?

I renounce to their well-

Call me quiet,
if you still need something.

Here, take this.

02:02:41.846 --> 02:02:44.121
What were you just thinking?

02:02:45.646 --> 02:02:47.398
Of my childhood ...

02:02:50.886 --> 02:02:52.683
When I was little,

02:02:52.926 --> 02:02:55.884
my mother told
I often have a history

02:02:56.126 --> 02:02:58.686
about a poor girl.

02:02:58.926 --> 02:03:02.282
One day a prince
riding on a white horse.

02:03:02.886 --> 02:03:06.162
He married her,
put it away,

02:03:06.886 --> 02:03:09.844
and all their dreams came true.

02:03:10.086 --> 02:03:14.079
Which I have as a child
always dreamed of.

02:03:17.766 --> 02:03:19.961
But when I became an adult,

02:03:20.206 --> 02:03:22.162
there were no white horses,

02:03:23.006 --> 02:03:27.636
but many white cars,
which many princes emerged.

02:03:30.686 --> 02:03:33.564
But none came,
to take me away.

02:03:33.966 --> 02:03:36.958
They all came
to buy me.

02:03:39.406 --> 02:03:41.874
Since I've noticed

02:03:42.126 --> 02:03:45.323
that just a fairy tale
was for children.

02:03:45.566 --> 02:03:49.036
In the real life
never happen to you.

02:03:58.806 --> 02:04:02.242
This will be a nice surprise
for Raj and Priya!

02:04:02.486 --> 02:04:05.239
Chotu, get the luggage, quick!
- That I can do alone!

02:04:05.486 --> 02:04:07.363
Quick, come with me.

02:04:12.486 --> 02:04:15.284
Grandpa is here
and has all brought. - What?

02:04:15.526 --> 02:04:17.517
This is your family? - Yes.

02:04:17.766 --> 02:04:20.519
Priya, they all believe
you are pregnant.

02:04:21.006 --> 02:04:23.395
Oh, my God! - Wait ...

02:04:24.886 --> 02:04:26.763
No, that's too big.

02:04:27.486 --> 02:04:29.363
This? - Yes, it is.

02:04:29.606 --> 02:04:32.564
Give her the talisman!
- But he is holy ...

02:04:32.806 --> 02:04:36.196
I know, take out the contents!
You wear only the shell!

02:04:36.446 --> 02:04:41.839
Surprise! We are here!
Where are you?

02:04:42.086 --> 02:04:44.475
Grandfather! Welcome back!

02:04:44.726 --> 02:04:46.125
Mother!

02:04:47.366 --> 02:04:51.484
Welcome back!
- A long life ....

02:04:57.606 --> 02:05:00.598
That is unfair! - What?
- Here in unannounced!

02:05:00.846 --> 02:05:05.078
We wanted to see Priya.
So we are going.

02:05:05.326 --> 02:05:08.079
Where is she? - Stuffing pillows.

02:05:08.326 --> 02:05:10.442
Stuff pillows? - Pillow?

02:05:10.686 --> 02:05:13.439
That's what you just said.
- No, she moves around.

02:05:22.846 --> 02:05:24.757
Come here, my child.

02:05:25.006 --> 02:05:27.884
God bless you.
You made us so happy!

02:05:28.126 --> 02:05:31.721
You do not have to bow yourself!
God bless you!

02:05:31.966 --> 02:05:34.719
Let me
expel the evil eye!

02:05:34.966 --> 02:05:36.957
How are you? - Good.

02:05:38.406 --> 02:05:40.601
Pappu, how are you?
Hello uncle.

02:05:40.846 --> 02:05:43.599
I've known: with a little
Fortunately, you're pregnant again

02:05:43.846 --> 02:05:46.599
even before the year is over.

02:06:08.726 --> 02:06:10.478
What's going on?

02:06:20.446 --> 02:06:22.960
The wife of a friend: Madhu.

02:06:23.206 --> 02:06:25.720
Your husband is on a business trip.

02:06:25.966 --> 02:06:29.242
She was all alone,
Therefore, we have taken it.

02:06:29.486 --> 02:06:31.238
Oh ...

02:06:31.486 --> 02:06:33.238
That's nice of you.

02:06:33.486 --> 02:06:35.954
In good hope should
not live alone.

02:06:36.206 --> 02:06:38.197
Come on!

02:06:39.006 --> 02:06:41.759
Bless me.
- God bless you!

02:06:42.006 --> 02:06:43.758
I'm Priya's mother.

02:06:44.006 --> 02:06:46.759
I know
Priya has told me so much about you.

02:06:47.006 --> 02:06:50.715
You are sure the aunt
You uncle, you Pappu

02:06:50.966 --> 02:06:53.719
and the grandfather.
Bless me.

02:06:53.966 --> 02:06:56.719
You do not have to bow yourself!
God bless you!

02:06:58.086 --> 02:07:01.158
You do not want me too
expel the evil eye?

02:07:05.006 --> 02:07:10.603
Why not you? May your marriage
be long and happy.

02:07:16.126 --> 02:07:19.084
... And therefore lives Mithun
Chakravarty in Ooty.

02:07:19.326 --> 02:07:22.284
Here delivers his dark skin color
not continue on.

02:07:22.526 --> 02:07:25.836
Grandfather, a biscuit?
- Thank you.

02:07:26.086 --> 02:07:30.557
Madhu, in which line of business
is your husband in?

02:07:30.806 --> 02:07:34.355
He, uh ...
- Lmport and Export ...

02:07:34.606 --> 02:07:37.996
Therefore, he is also constantly
traveling around the world.

02:07:38.246 --> 02:07:40.123
Again and on the road. - I see ...

02:07:40.366 --> 02:07:42.118
Shops are certainly important,

02:07:42.366 --> 02:07:45.278
but his pregnant wife
simply to leave it alone ...

02:07:45.526 --> 02:07:48.279
That's not a problem,
we take care of them.

02:07:48.526 --> 02:07:51.404
Just as we
will take care of Priya.

02:08:13.606 --> 02:08:17.440
As Vishnu heard this, he took the
Shape and crying of a child.

02:08:17.686 --> 02:08:20.154
He was a child so charmingly,

02:08:20.406 --> 02:08:25.082
that this is his mother Kaushalya
to tears.

02:08:25.326 --> 02:08:28.921
It means that if the story
Ramchandras of birth

02:08:29.166 --> 02:08:32.044
an expectant mother told

02:08:32.286 --> 02:08:35.403
like this even
her unborn child.

02:08:35.646 --> 02:08:37.876
Have you felt something in you?

02:08:52.086 --> 02:08:55.635
Why are you standing at the door?
Come quietly.

02:08:55.886 --> 02:08:58.002
Come and sit down.

02:09:02.046 --> 02:09:05.641
Look what happened
Lord Rama was born as the

02:09:05.886 --> 02:09:08.036
Dasrath and what his father did.

02:09:08.286 --> 02:09:11.915
A father would be twice
so much about a son

02:09:12.166 --> 02:09:13.918
than does the mother.

02:09:17.846 --> 02:09:20.360
What are you thinking right now?

02:09:21.206 --> 02:09:23.322
Do you miss your husband?

02:09:25.326 --> 02:09:28.398
It is certainly not easy for him
in the distance you constantly

02:09:28.646 --> 02:09:31.922
and your child
need to think.

02:09:45.846 --> 02:09:47.723
Priya. - Yes, Mother?

02:09:47.966 --> 02:09:51.356
I got lngwerkonfekt for you.
You surely know yet?

02:09:51.606 --> 02:09:54.598
I bought it in Delhi.
Here, eat!

02:10:04.446 --> 02:10:06.243
Come on, sit down.

02:10:06.846 --> 02:10:09.644
Mother gave me
brought lngwerkonfekt.

02:10:09.886 --> 02:10:11.877
This is very healthy. Take ...

02:10:18.286 --> 02:10:20.038
Sharp ...?

02:10:20.286 --> 02:10:22.197
I found last year as well,

02:10:22.446 --> 02:10:25.563
but it has forced me to
which to eat.

02:10:25.806 --> 02:10:27.717
Want another one?

02:10:28.486 --> 02:10:31.796
Mother in law!
No word on the sweets!

02:10:32.046 --> 02:10:33.798
Madhu! - Mother?

02:10:34.046 --> 02:10:36.924
There you are! I love you
Looking at your room.

02:10:37.166 --> 02:10:38.918
I was at grandfather.

02:10:40.406 --> 02:10:42.681
What's going on? Are you crying?

02:10:42.926 --> 02:10:44.279
No ...

02:10:44.526 --> 02:10:48.041
I have
seen a sad movie.

02:10:48.286 --> 02:10:51.562
And since you had to cry?
Come on.

02:10:53.366 --> 02:10:55.163
Sit down, do not worry.

02:10:55.406 --> 02:10:58.523
Madhu
here is the candied lngwer.

02:10:58.766 --> 02:11:01.917
Very healthy for a mother
and her unborn child!

02:11:02.166 --> 02:11:04.043
Thanks, I'll eat it later.

02:11:04.286 --> 02:11:07.835
No, not later, now!
lss it here before my eyes,

02:11:08.086 --> 02:11:11.635
otherwise you throw it away,
because it is too sharp you.

02:11:11.886 --> 02:11:15.356
Do the beautiful mouth!
That's brave ...

02:11:15.606 --> 02:11:18.325
Delicious, is not it?

02:11:22.006 --> 02:11:25.043
Madhu?
Your legs are all swollen!

02:11:25.846 --> 02:11:29.839
I was at the doctor.
He said it happens.

02:11:30.086 --> 02:11:32.042
But not so thick after all.

02:11:32.806 --> 02:11:35.718
I'll be your feet
massage with herbal oil.

02:11:35.966 --> 02:11:37.797
This helps to reduce the swelling.

02:11:38.046 --> 02:11:41.959
Bring me the herbal oil!
- Here it is!

02:11:45.086 --> 02:11:46.838
Put your feet up. - No,

02:11:47.086 --> 02:11:50.044
You have my feet
really do not touch, please.

02:11:50.286 --> 02:11:53.198
But I still like to do that,
my child.

02:11:53.446 --> 02:11:56.836
For me you are
as a separate subsidiary,

02:12:10.006 --> 02:12:11.917
Who still lives in your family,
my child?

02:12:13.566 --> 02:12:15.397
No one, I am alone.

02:12:16.286 --> 02:12:18.117
And your people in lndia?

02:12:20.846 --> 02:12:22.757
I got no one in the world.

02:12:30.886 --> 02:12:35.676
Never say again,
you had no one.

02:12:36.566 --> 02:12:40.081
From now on
We are your family.

02:12:58.686 --> 02:13:02.281
Hello Reverend, how are you?
Yes, just a moment ...

02:13:02.526 --> 02:13:05.882
Grandfather,
it is the priest of Delhi ...

02:13:07.206 --> 02:13:09.197
Reverend, good day ...

02:13:09.446 --> 02:13:13.439
Who is that? - The Priest.
- What does he want? - No idea.

02:13:13.686 --> 02:13:17.679
Yes, it remains the case. Make
further and prepare everything.

02:13:17.926 --> 02:13:20.235
Grandfather, who was that?

The ceremony for conception

02:13:41.846 --> 02:13:45.475
Driving with Raj to the office,
sit at a meeting and tell them

02:13:45.726 --> 02:13:47.523
that he needs to lndia!

02:13:47.766 --> 02:13:50.599
Grandfather, the priest can
not come? - Why?

02:13:50.846 --> 02:13:53.644
Priya's birth
is scheduled for this month

02:13:53.886 --> 02:13:56.719
and here they have very good
medical facilities!

02:13:56.966 --> 02:13:58.718
A call to the Minister sufficient

02:13:58.966 --> 02:14:01.799
and tomorrow
all these facilities in Delhi!

02:14:02.046 --> 02:14:03.843
What is his number?

02:14:04.086 --> 02:14:06.919
Pappu, here you do the ministers
no favors.

02:14:07.166 --> 02:14:08.918
Now I like it lndia!

02:14:09.166 --> 02:14:11.919
In Delhi, there are also very good
equipped hospitals.

02:14:12.166 --> 02:14:16.045
And come to the ceremony
All friends and relatives.

02:14:16.286 --> 02:14:19.164
You're right.
Let's go to lndia.

02:14:19.406 --> 02:14:22.159
Madhu
I promised your husband,

02:14:22.406 --> 02:14:25.239
take care of yourself,
because your and Priya's birth

02:14:25.486 --> 02:14:28.239
for the same time
are recognized.

02:14:28.486 --> 02:14:30.556
But we need to lndia,

02:14:30.806 --> 02:14:33.764
for I must Grandfather
not disagree.

02:14:34.006 --> 02:14:36.998
I'm here everything you need
cause for you.

02:14:37.246 --> 02:14:39.999
If your contractions are,
just go to the clinic.

02:14:40.246 --> 02:14:41.998
Are you crazy?

02:14:42.246 --> 02:14:44.999
How is she in her condition
go alone to the hospital?

02:14:45.246 --> 02:14:48.238
It remains her no choice
they can not very well

02:14:48.486 --> 02:14:50.283
fly with us to lndia.

02:14:50.526 --> 02:14:53.962
Why not you? You're supposed to
take care of them. - Yes.

02:14:55.206 --> 02:14:56.958
Listen, I have decided:

02:14:57.206 --> 02:14:59.959
Madhu flies back with us
to Delhi!

02:15:12.126 --> 02:15:14.879
These are my father,
my brother and his wife.

02:15:15.126 --> 02:15:16.923
What do you wear? - Gifts:

02:15:17.166 --> 02:15:20.556
A robe that mother's
to wear at the ceremony.

02:15:20.806 --> 02:15:22.842
Such a beautiful party!

02:15:27.286 --> 02:15:30.084
Pappu, the priest needs
Rice for the ceremony.

02:15:30.326 --> 02:15:33.318
I call on the Minister of Food,
how many tons do you want?

02:15:33.566 --> 02:15:36.842
I need a handful of degrees times!
Get him out of the kitchen!

02:15:38.686 --> 02:15:41.678
Sorry,
have you seen Uncle Bhatia?

02:15:41.926 --> 02:15:44.440
No, I have not. Why?

02:15:44.686 --> 02:15:47.439
What is this?
What do you take me?

02:15:47.686 --> 02:15:49.642
Sorry, it's a tick.

02:15:49.886 --> 02:15:54.004
Was your mother ever
in'' Red House'' in Fatehpur?

02:15:54.246 --> 02:15:57.841
In the'' Red House''?
My mother did not,

02:15:59.046 --> 02:16:01.560
but my father already.

02:16:06.886 --> 02:16:10.640
Dad always said I would
still a little sister ...

02:16:10.886 --> 02:16:12.638
... Father?

02:16:16.286 --> 02:16:19.642
Priya, here is your robe.
Make yourself ready now.

02:16:19.886 --> 02:16:22.878
Go ahead already down.
I'm coming with Priya.

02:16:25.126 --> 02:16:27.879
Unfortunately my child does not go.

02:16:28.126 --> 02:16:31.323
I wanted the ceremony
for both of you is held,

02:16:31.566 --> 02:16:33.317
but the priest says,

02:16:33.566 --> 02:16:36.602
that the ceremony
may participate in only one woman.

02:16:36.846 --> 02:16:38.245
Good mother.

02:16:39.286 --> 02:16:41.038
Priya, dear child,

02:16:42.286 --> 02:16:46.199
Today you have to be so pretty
as a bride. - Yes.

02:16:46.446 --> 02:16:50.644
In the life of a woman is this
Ceremony special.

02:16:50.886 --> 02:16:55.482
A woman is not just once
born, but three times:

02:16:55.726 --> 02:16:58.718
First, it is
born as a daughter,

02:16:58.966 --> 02:17:01.559

It was a nice party. - Yes.

02:27:10.526 --> 02:27:13.677
The best part was father in law.
Have you seen him dance?

02:27:13.926 --> 02:27:17.282
Something's brewing.
I'm going to close the windows.

02:27:17.526 --> 02:27:20.723
You go to bed, it's late.
And I sleep so well!

02:27:20.966 --> 02:27:22.877
Be blessed.

02:28:08.566 --> 02:28:11.558
Have you seen Madhu?
- Yes, she is the train station.

02:28:33.606 --> 02:28:35.403
Where are you going?

02:28:35.886 --> 02:28:39.083
You're not the mother
this child, but I do.

02:28:40.566 --> 02:28:44.195
This is my child.
I can not give you!

02:28:45.006 --> 02:28:48.442
Forgive me!
I simply can not!

02:28:48.686 --> 02:28:50.438
Please do not say something!

02:28:50.686 --> 02:28:53.439
For nine months, I have
prayed for this child!

02:28:53.686 --> 02:28:56.439
Every day I dream of him!
Not only Raj and I,

02:28:56.686 --> 02:28:59.439
all are in our family
the days until the birth.

02:28:59.686 --> 02:29:02.246
Our happiness
attached to this child!

02:29:02.486 --> 02:29:06.479
I'd rather kill myself,
when my child to give her!

02:29:07.286 --> 02:29:10.084
You lack nothing,
unlike me!

02:29:10.326 --> 02:29:13.124
You can marry
and again to be a mother!

02:29:13.366 --> 02:29:17.154
But I'm infertile,
I can never be a mother.

02:29:17.406 --> 02:29:20.478
I implore you:
Give me this child!

02:29:20.726 --> 02:29:24.116
I'll give it everything
what you want:

02:29:24.366 --> 02:29:27.676
Money, possessions,
whatever you want!

02:29:27.926 --> 02:29:31.601
Well, I'll give you my child,
although I may

02:29:31.846 --> 02:29:33.643
get your man!

02:29:44.006 --> 02:29:46.281
You remain a child of the gutter!

02:29:46.526 --> 02:29:49.882
And I thought, even a whore
is finally a Mrs!

02:29:50.126 --> 02:29:52.959
But a whore
is good for nothing.

02:29:53.206 --> 02:29:55.197
You've just proven!

02:29:55.446 --> 02:29:57.437
Whores only make it broken!

02:29:57.686 --> 02:30:01.838
I ask you for your husband,
and you call me a whore!

02:30:02.086 --> 02:30:04.964
But you are asking yourself,
that a mother leaves her child?

02:30:05.206 --> 02:30:06.958
Whether whore or wife,

02:30:07.206 --> 02:30:09.959
a mother is always a mother!

02:30:11.006 --> 02:30:14.885
You'll never get my child,
Never!

02:30:19.846 --> 02:30:22.804
She does not want us to give our child!
- Just look!

02:30:27.606 --> 02:30:29.358
Call the doctor immediately!

02:30:38.326 --> 02:30:41.523
Do not worry.
It will be all good again!

02:31:00.886 --> 02:31:02.638
It is currently being investigated.

02:31:02.886 --> 02:31:05.844
Soon we will know
if there are complications.

02:31:07.686 --> 02:31:10.758
It is the mother ...
... Hello, Mom?

02:31:11.006 --> 02:31:13.804
I've searched for you in the house,
where you are because only three?

02:31:14.046 --> 02:31:17.959
They got both labor:
I took her to the hospital.

02:31:18.206 --> 02:31:21.721
How beautiful! I'll tell all communication
and then we come.

02:31:21.966 --> 02:31:23.718
No, Mom,

02:31:23.966 --> 02:31:27.356
that you do not need.
Dr. Balraj's already here.

02:31:27.606 --> 02:31:29.324
I have just come alone.

02:31:29.566 --> 02:31:30.760
Sorry,

02:31:31.006 --> 02:31:33.042
The doctor wants to see you.

02:31:38.486 --> 02:31:41.284
The child has dropped out
turned to its normal position.

02:31:41.526 --> 02:31:44.279
You must be operated on immediately!
- Then you begin.

02:31:44.526 --> 02:31:47.324
It's critical!
I can save just one life:

02:31:47.646 --> 02:31:49.637
Mother or child?

02:31:51.566 --> 02:31:53.318
We have to decide!

02:31:58.846 --> 02:32:02.043
Doctor
save the mother's life!

02:32:07.326 --> 02:32:09.123
Quick, bring them to the operating room!

02:32:09.366 --> 02:32:12.278
We still need
a signature ...

02:32:21.926 --> 02:32:23.803
Bring them in! Quick!

02:32:53.886 --> 02:32:57.117
Good News!
A miracle has happened!

02:32:57.366 --> 02:33:00.722
The operation was successful:
Mother and child are doing well!

02:33:10.566 --> 02:33:12.761
Congratulations, it's a boy!

02:33:40.886 --> 02:33:43.400
Such a sweet kid!

02:33:45.446 --> 02:33:47.402
You wanted to save the mother?

02:33:49.166 --> 02:33:52.203
It lives ... and your baby too!

02:33:55.006 --> 02:33:58.078
I do not know
what's come over me just now.

02:33:58.326 --> 02:34:00.078
I was selfish.

02:34:00.326 --> 02:34:03.955
You're his mother, not me.

02:34:07.166 --> 02:34:08.918
Here is your son.

02:34:28.846 --> 02:34:31.838
I want my grandchildren
times also entertained!

02:34:32.086 --> 02:34:36.318
Look at me!
I'm your grandfather!

02:34:41.286 --> 02:34:44.517
How's Madhu?
Boy or girl?

02:34:45.686 --> 02:34:48.439
The poor,
they had a stillbirth.

02:34:55.886 --> 02:34:58.798
Dear, do not be sad!

02:34:59.046 --> 02:35:01.924
Just think,
it would not have been your child.

02:35:02.166 --> 02:35:04.999
Priya has also
lost their first child,

02:35:05.246 --> 02:35:08.204
But even before the year ended
went, God gave her a new one.

02:35:08.566 --> 02:35:10.363
Yes, my child ...

02:35:32.606 --> 02:35:34.358
Please do not leave us.

02:35:34.606 --> 02:35:37.598
I'm the family
tell the truth.

02:35:37.846 --> 02:35:41.555
When two brothers together
can live under one roof,

02:35:41.806 --> 02:35:44.798
then why not
two sisters?

02:35:47.286 --> 02:35:50.517
Here I have
found a family,

02:35:50.766 --> 02:35:54.281
I missed only one sister.
And now I have too!

02:35:55.846 --> 02:35:58.599
I would like to remain your sister,

02:35:58.846 --> 02:36:01.599
and not Raj's concubine.

02:36:02.086 --> 02:36:06.876
Only then will confidence
exist between us!

02:36:09.486 --> 02:36:11.442
In this family

02:36:11.686 --> 02:36:14.644
you have only
entitled to Raj!

02:36:15.486 --> 02:36:19.684
Stay with me the wonderful memories
of our time.

02:36:21.526 --> 02:36:23.482
I had a daughter,

02:36:23.726 --> 02:36:25.682
a bride,

02:36:25.926 --> 02:36:28.315
even a mother.

02:36:28.926 --> 02:36:30.917
What could I ask for?

02:36:44.286 --> 02:36:47.164
I've checked in you,
Here is your boarding pass.

02:36:47.406 --> 02:36:49.158
Your luggage has been abandoned.

02:36:49.886 --> 02:36:52.878
This here is the key
for your new house.

02:36:53.126 --> 02:36:56.436
And a couple of blank checks
on your behalf.

02:36:58.006 --> 02:37:01.078
What you got for me and Priya
've done ...

02:37:01.326 --> 02:37:03.715
All my wealth ...

02:37:03.966 --> 02:37:08.881
would not be sufficient,
to reward you.

02:37:09.126 --> 02:37:13.597
Please take this
as a small gift from us.

02:37:13.846 --> 02:37:16.883
I've my gift,
look!

02:37:18.646 --> 02:37:21.479
I'm taking my whole family.

02:37:21.726 --> 02:37:24.718
If I assume here
I would feel,

02:37:24.966 --> 02:37:28.083
like a mother
who has sold her child.

02:37:28.326 --> 02:37:32.035
You're not thinking ...?
- I do not go back there,

02:37:32.286 --> 02:37:34.038
where you picked me up.

02:37:38.286 --> 02:37:42.199
After this touch of you
may touch me no more.
