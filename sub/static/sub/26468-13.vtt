00:00.080 --> 00:01.942
Previously on Andi Mack...

00:01.967 --> 00:03.636
You're the shooting guard
for the Monarchs.

00:03.660 --> 00:05.429
We could really use a shooting guard.

00:05.463 --> 00:07.231
Please, join the team?

00:07.792 --> 00:10.234
Denied! At least try next time.

00:10.267 --> 00:13.304
You were right. This team is a hot mess.

00:14.157 --> 00:16.660
- I can't have you on the team.
- What a joke.

00:17.138 --> 00:19.714
- What were you guys talking about?
- I can't do a somersault, okay?

00:19.738 --> 00:22.641
You can't do a somersault?
I can help you with that.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.894
I came to congratulate you
on your engagement.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.728
- Thank you.
- I just wish my relationship

00:28.762 --> 00:31.163
with Morgan's father
was more like yours.

00:31.196 --> 00:32.980
I never saw it coming.

00:33.005 --> 00:35.409
For six years, we had
a pretty perfect relationship.

00:35.434 --> 00:38.237
- And then?
- And then, we got married.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.606
- Are these wedding invitations?
- Yeah.

00:40.639 --> 00:42.218
You know, this is
my favorite part of the job,

00:42.242 --> 00:44.678
when someone's life
is gonna change forever.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.346
- Um...
- Wait! What?

00:46.379 --> 00:48.782
I don't think I'm gonna mail
these out today after all.

00:48.815 --> 00:49.822
Is that Jonah?

00:49.847 --> 00:52.219
I'm really glad he's had
Amber to confide in.

00:52.251 --> 00:54.888
I can't believe I thought they
were actually back together.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.028
Anyone else feel like
their eyes are burning?

01:05.274 --> 01:07.176
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

01:07.209 --> 01:09.980
We all saw that? That just happened?

01:11.848 --> 01:13.983
He's coming over. Uh, act natural.

01:14.016 --> 01:17.655
- I don't remember how.
- No, we need answers.

01:19.388 --> 01:21.024
Hey! Jonah!

01:22.491 --> 01:25.228
Would it kill her
to mind her own business?

01:29.903 --> 01:30.938
Hey, guys.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.703
- Jonah!
- Joey Bee!

01:32.705 --> 01:34.941
- Anything you want to tell us?
- Huh?

01:34.974 --> 01:37.277
- We just saw you with Amber.
- What happened with Libby?

01:37.310 --> 01:38.912
Do you have two girlfriends?

01:38.944 --> 01:40.247
Not cool, Beck.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.849
- We thought Amber was your friend.
- Well, she is.

01:42.882 --> 01:44.827
And that she was helping
you through a tough time.

01:44.851 --> 01:46.854
- She was.
- With kissing?

01:46.887 --> 01:48.610
Okay, okay. I'm not being a jerk.

01:49.488 --> 01:52.359
- Libby and I broke up.
- When?

01:53.325 --> 01:56.129
- A couple days ago.
- Why didn't you tell us?

01:56.385 --> 01:59.500
I was embarrassed. She broke up with me.

01:59.768 --> 02:02.170
And you're already back with Amber?

02:02.202 --> 02:04.365
- Amber?
- It just happened.

02:06.141 --> 02:08.143
I'll catch you guys later.

02:10.077 --> 02:12.713
Maybe it'll be different
for him this time around.

02:12.747 --> 02:14.083
Amber's changed a lot.

02:15.088 --> 02:16.217
You're welcome.

02:16.250 --> 02:20.588
Hmm. And as the next ex in the lineup,

02:20.622 --> 02:23.691
- you're on deck.
- Nope. Not it.

02:23.725 --> 02:25.427
Mack out.

03:24.028 --> 03:25.963
- Is this something?
- No.

03:25.995 --> 03:27.832
Maybe. Turn it around.

03:29.399 --> 03:32.135
What is it supposed to be?

03:32.168 --> 03:34.005
I'm not sure.

03:34.037 --> 03:37.340
Oh, what about this? Is this something?

03:42.641 --> 03:44.410
What the...?

03:44.443 --> 03:46.746
Metcalf just announced Costume Day.

03:46.778 --> 03:48.948
We love Costume Day.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.616
It's this Friday.

03:52.284 --> 03:54.387
No! That's too soon!

03:54.420 --> 03:56.255
Two days' notice? I mean,

03:56.288 --> 03:58.758
who can plan a costume in two days?

03:58.790 --> 04:00.460
We're not wizards, Metcalf.

04:00.492 --> 04:03.395
- I got my costume.
- What is it?

04:03.428 --> 04:06.199
Average kid before he finds
out he's a superhero.

04:06.231 --> 04:08.300
Basically, what you're wearing?

04:08.333 --> 04:11.204
But in two days, I'll call it a costume.

04:11.236 --> 04:14.973
Wait. Guys, hello?
We know what we're gonna be.

04:16.341 --> 04:18.478
Mount Rushmore.

04:19.345 --> 04:20.446
Eh...

04:20.478 --> 04:24.249
We have the heads,
and the mountain's already made.

04:25.850 --> 04:27.420
Please?

04:27.453 --> 04:30.089
We'll definitely get a two-page
spread in the yearbook.

04:30.122 --> 04:32.124
It does scream photo op.

04:32.158 --> 04:34.104
- That'd be cool.
- Can I wear this?

04:34.271 --> 04:37.241
Yeah, you don't have to do anything.

04:37.275 --> 04:39.811
Except paint your face
gray and wear a sheet.

04:39.843 --> 04:42.780
Okay, so two small things,
but it'll be epic, okay?

04:42.814 --> 04:45.215
And for the rest of your life,
when anyone asks,

04:45.249 --> 04:49.754
what was your best costume,
you can say Mount Rushmore.

04:50.955 --> 04:51.990
Is this something?

04:52.023 --> 04:54.258
Yes. Annoying.

05:01.532 --> 05:03.133
- Hey!
- Yo!

05:03.167 --> 05:05.136
Really?

05:05.169 --> 05:07.305
- What?
- You talk like that now?

05:07.338 --> 05:08.405
"Yo!"

05:08.439 --> 05:10.809
I talk the same way I've always talked.

05:10.842 --> 05:12.477
We just haven't talked in a while.

05:12.509 --> 05:15.245
- Well, who's fault is that?
- Yours.

05:15.278 --> 05:18.516
Excuse me, I'm not the one
who went underground.

05:18.549 --> 05:20.150
I didn't go underground.

05:20.184 --> 05:23.688
That's what it felt like.
You just disappeared.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.624
Well, I'm glad you called.

05:26.645 --> 05:28.615
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:29.848 --> 05:32.050
- Me too.
- Why did you?

05:33.218 --> 05:35.687
I missed you.

05:35.719 --> 05:37.688
I don't know if you remember,

05:37.721 --> 05:39.724
but we used to spend
a lot of time together.

05:40.183 --> 05:41.318
Did we?

05:42.923 --> 05:44.558
I remember.

05:45.617 --> 05:48.729
And it was fun,
pretty much the whole time.

05:50.238 --> 05:53.342
I should probably tell you
that I have a girlfriend.

05:54.409 --> 05:57.344
I heard. I'm really happy for you.

05:57.378 --> 06:01.049
I'm really happy for me too.

06:01.082 --> 06:03.351
So, can we be friends again?

06:03.383 --> 06:05.186
Now that the pressure's off?

06:06.888 --> 06:08.356
Do you still run?

06:08.388 --> 06:09.790
You bet.

06:09.823 --> 06:11.492
Mostly long distance now.

06:11.525 --> 06:13.727
With your "girrl-friend"?

06:13.760 --> 06:17.864
She's my girlfriend,
not my "girrl-friend."

06:23.880 --> 06:26.015
- Let's go!
- TJ!

06:26.048 --> 06:29.452
- Hey.
- I'm Kira. I play, too.

06:29.485 --> 06:30.563
I know.

06:30.588 --> 06:32.388
Any chance I could try
out for the boys' team?

06:32.810 --> 06:34.882
There's a girls' team now.

06:34.929 --> 06:36.813
Yeah, that didn't really work out.

06:36.846 --> 06:40.150
- Buffy kicked me off.
- Yeah, I heard.

06:40.183 --> 06:41.986
That's too bad. You're a good player.

06:42.019 --> 06:44.889
- How do you know?
- Well, I've seen you play.

06:44.921 --> 06:46.796
I went to a couple
of Monarchs games last year.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.218
Oh, did you?

06:48.243 --> 06:49.642
Yo!

06:49.896 --> 06:53.600
- Cyrus, my man!
- Teej, looking good!

06:53.632 --> 06:55.401
This is Kira. Kira, Cyrus.

06:55.435 --> 06:57.336
Hey, I, uh, actually know who you are.

06:57.890 --> 06:59.733
You're Buffy's friend, right?

06:59.758 --> 07:01.294
Yeah.

07:03.751 --> 07:05.278
You ready?

07:05.303 --> 07:06.772
I'll find you later, yeah?

07:11.618 --> 07:13.187
She seems nice.

07:13.219 --> 07:15.321
If the word "nice"
had a different meaning.

07:16.456 --> 07:18.725
So, you guys hanging out now?

07:18.757 --> 07:21.894
Basketball, you know.
Hey, I wanted to ask you.

07:21.928 --> 07:23.797
What you got going on for Costume Day?

07:23.829 --> 07:25.365
Costume Day?

07:25.397 --> 07:27.700
You don't strike me
as a Costume Day guy.

07:27.733 --> 07:29.303
I have layers.

07:29.336 --> 07:31.472
- Anyway, I have this idea.
- Listening.

07:31.505 --> 07:33.440
Okay, so one person dresses up

07:33.473 --> 07:35.442
in board shorts,
sunglasses, and flip-flops,

07:35.475 --> 07:37.411
and the other, dresses up
like a saltshaker.

07:37.444 --> 07:39.480
Oh! Sea salt!

07:39.512 --> 07:41.481
That would've been good, but no.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.418
Oh... No. Don't tell me, don't tell me.

07:44.451 --> 07:46.053
"Somersault."

07:46.086 --> 07:47.988
- Bam.
- Bam!

07:48.021 --> 07:50.390
- I thought it was funny.
- It is funny.

07:50.423 --> 07:52.997
- So you in?
- I call summer.

07:53.526 --> 07:55.428
Or unless you want to be summer. I...

07:55.461 --> 07:58.498
Well, I already have the board
shorts and the sunglasses and...

07:58.531 --> 07:59.832
I call salt.

07:59.865 --> 08:01.743
Oh, and I gotta call Andi.

08:13.145 --> 08:15.214
Should I even ask?

08:15.668 --> 08:18.072
I'm getting a candid picture of myself.

08:18.105 --> 08:20.540
Do you know what a candid picture is?

08:20.574 --> 08:22.377
Because it's not this.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.305
Not candid candid.

08:24.539 --> 08:26.640
InstaPic candid.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.337
I want it to look like
I'm not trying too hard.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.215
This is really hard.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.384
Well, good luck with it then.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.220
Hey, if you have a minute,

08:40.253 --> 08:43.024
could you snap some quick shots of me?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.059
Sure.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.772
So, you and Jonah?

08:58.357 --> 09:01.075
Did he say something to you?

09:01.460 --> 09:05.864
Actually, we saw you guys,
you know, yesterday,

09:05.897 --> 09:07.800
and so we asked him about it.

09:07.832 --> 09:09.300
And?

09:10.269 --> 09:14.174
Well, he didn't say much,
because, you know, he's Jonah.

09:14.207 --> 09:16.977
We were spending all this time together,

09:17.010 --> 09:19.815
and I guess we realized
we might like each other...

09:20.380 --> 09:21.380
again.

09:22.216 --> 09:25.318
It's okay. I think it's nice.

09:25.351 --> 09:27.254
You do?

09:27.287 --> 09:29.690
Yeah, I mean, you seem happy.

09:30.289 --> 09:31.649
I am!

09:32.271 --> 09:34.208
And I think we got the shot.

09:38.616 --> 09:40.336
These are amazing!

09:40.894 --> 09:42.611
I look so good!

09:43.404 --> 09:44.726
Shocker.

09:50.410 --> 09:52.445
What are you doing?

09:52.479 --> 09:55.549
- I need a sheet.
- Huh?

09:55.582 --> 09:58.019
- For a costume.
- What?

09:58.052 --> 09:59.954
Never mind!

09:59.986 --> 10:01.923
Wait, let me help you.

10:06.393 --> 10:08.790
Are these your wedding invitations?

10:09.395 --> 10:10.770
I can explain.

10:12.239 --> 10:13.574
Go ahead.

10:19.463 --> 10:20.799
I'm gonna mail them.

10:21.213 --> 10:22.414
Well, you certainly put them

10:22.448 --> 10:24.516
in a very convenient spot to do that.

10:24.549 --> 10:27.719
I went to the mailbox.
I was all set to mail them.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.021
But?

10:29.054 --> 10:30.365
I don't know...

10:31.156 --> 10:32.599
I didn't.

10:32.824 --> 10:34.374
I couldn't.

10:35.242 --> 10:37.832
These invitations, they're just so...

10:38.297 --> 10:42.646
with the calligraphy
and the wax seal and the vellum.

10:42.671 --> 10:45.871
I can't even believe
I'm saying the word "vellum."

10:45.904 --> 10:48.308
It was too much. I froze.

10:48.341 --> 10:51.244
Well, we can get different invitations.

10:51.409 --> 10:52.611
It's not that.

10:58.517 --> 10:59.785
Does Bowie know?

11:01.878 --> 11:04.285
But you still love him, right?

11:04.756 --> 11:07.159
I mean, things are still
good between you guys?

11:07.193 --> 11:09.062
Yes, of course!

11:09.095 --> 11:13.266
Things with Bowie
have been perfect really.

11:16.013 --> 11:17.349
Okay?

11:20.438 --> 11:22.117
I'll mail them tomorrow.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.214
No. We will mail them tomorrow.

11:25.239 --> 11:26.578
I'll come home from school,

11:26.611 --> 11:28.832
and we'll go
to the post office together.

11:29.649 --> 11:31.830
Also, I'm taking this sheet.

11:31.864 --> 11:33.603
I'm gonna cut a hole in it
and paint it gray,

11:33.627 --> 11:35.930
so it's kind of dead to you.
Okay-thanks-bye!

11:44.290 --> 11:46.526
- Quick question.
- That's never true.

11:46.567 --> 11:48.993
Fair point. Do you think Andi
will still be my friend

11:49.018 --> 11:50.384
if I bail on Mount Rushmore?

11:50.409 --> 11:52.545
Quick answer? No.

11:53.448 --> 11:55.942
TJ wants to do a costume with me.

11:57.298 --> 11:59.621
You know how much Andi's
been looking forward to this.

12:00.534 --> 12:03.104
I know, but TJ has a great idea:

12:03.136 --> 12:04.404
"somersault."

12:04.437 --> 12:07.976
It's our thing. You understand, right?

12:08.009 --> 12:09.610
I do.

12:09.643 --> 12:11.745
But Costume Day is tomorrow.

12:11.779 --> 12:14.349
I know. I wish I could
find a replacement,

12:14.381 --> 12:16.984
but everyone I would ask
is already on her mountain.

12:17.018 --> 12:18.623
I think I know someone.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.376
You have other friends? Since when?

12:28.895 --> 12:31.418
Amber, what are you doing here?

12:32.198 --> 12:35.202
I posted one of those pictures
you took of me on InstaPic,

12:35.390 --> 12:37.435
but Jonah didn't heart it.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.023
Okay, maybe he didn't see it.

12:40.140 --> 12:41.875
He was hearting other pictures.

12:41.908 --> 12:43.811
I wouldn't read too much into this.

12:43.843 --> 12:46.379
How could he not know
what kind of message that sends?

12:46.413 --> 12:49.600
You could just tell him
this is important to you.

12:49.708 --> 12:52.519
Or... you could.

12:59.693 --> 13:01.041
- Hey!
- Hey.

13:01.408 --> 13:02.744
You excited for tomorrow?

13:02.777 --> 13:04.812
- What's tomorrow?
- Costume Day!

13:05.412 --> 13:07.282
Oh, right.

13:07.315 --> 13:08.616
You are going to thank me

13:08.648 --> 13:10.552
when we get a big picture
in the yearbook.

13:10.585 --> 13:12.519
I've had big pictures in the yearbook.

13:12.552 --> 13:14.456
Oh really? What year?

13:14.489 --> 13:15.590
Every year.

13:16.175 --> 13:17.392
Okay.

13:17.425 --> 13:19.294
Well, some of us have
to work a little harder

13:19.326 --> 13:23.263
to get pictures of ourselves
out there, like Amber.

13:23.297 --> 13:24.752
You should have seen her

13:24.777 --> 13:26.477
trying to get a photo of
herself for InstaPic.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.903
She spends a lot of time on InstaPic.

13:28.936 --> 13:33.074
Right, so when she posts
a photo of herself,

13:33.106 --> 13:34.975
- you have to heart it.
- I do!

13:35.009 --> 13:36.610
I mean, most of them.

13:36.643 --> 13:39.047
Okay, well you have
to heart all of them.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.448
Even the makeup ones?

13:40.480 --> 13:42.450
Even the makeup ones.

13:43.817 --> 13:46.321
So, Mount Rushmore?

13:47.287 --> 13:48.623
Rock on.

13:55.462 --> 14:00.434
- Hey.
- The one and only Buffy Driscoll.

14:00.467 --> 14:03.504
You know, it's nice when
I see you to be like,

14:03.537 --> 14:05.672
I can just go over there
and talk to him.

14:05.706 --> 14:08.009
You're welcome. Anytime.

14:08.042 --> 14:11.311
And maybe I could even ask him a favor?

14:11.345 --> 14:14.249
Depends. How big is it?

14:14.282 --> 14:17.185
Oh, about this big.

14:27.494 --> 14:28.730
I've been looking for you.

14:29.563 --> 14:31.365
I'm not hiding. 'Sup?

14:32.365 --> 14:34.268
I have a great idea for Costume Day.

14:34.302 --> 14:36.204
Basketball related,
but it needs two people.

14:36.236 --> 14:37.504
Super simple. You in?

14:37.537 --> 14:38.807
I already have a costume.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.477
Oh. What is it?

14:42.509 --> 14:45.345
Well, Cyrus and I
are doing "somersault."

14:45.379 --> 14:47.081
It's an inside joke.

14:47.882 --> 14:50.451
Oh. Everybody loves an inside joke...

14:50.484 --> 14:52.466
they don't understand.

14:52.853 --> 14:55.123
My costume idea is really cool.

14:55.156 --> 14:56.891
Nah, I'm set.

14:56.923 --> 14:59.893
So you'd rather do a costume
with Cyrus than with me?

14:59.927 --> 15:01.495
Okay, have fun with that.

15:16.377 --> 15:17.579
Uh-oh.

15:17.611 --> 15:18.980
What-oh?

15:19.013 --> 15:20.915
The last time I came home
to find you two

15:20.947 --> 15:22.853
in this ominous tableau, you told me

15:22.878 --> 15:25.848
that CeCe and Pops
were selling the house.

15:27.150 --> 15:28.285
What is it this time?

15:36.373 --> 15:37.620
Let me guess.

15:38.636 --> 15:41.793
We're not mailing out
your wedding invitations today.

15:46.002 --> 15:47.471
Or ever?

15:54.919 --> 15:57.940
So, you two are not getting married?

15:58.407 --> 15:59.642
Andi...

16:00.964 --> 16:02.800
And you're okay with this?

16:04.915 --> 16:07.335
All right, go ahead.

16:07.629 --> 16:10.599
Give me the speech.
I know you've got one.

16:10.631 --> 16:14.067
It's not a speech, it's an explanation.

16:14.534 --> 16:18.206
This wedding, with all
the planning and the details,

16:18.239 --> 16:19.740
it's a lot.

16:19.774 --> 16:21.342
And what I have with Bowie...

16:21.375 --> 16:23.845
and what we have as a family,
the three of us,

16:23.878 --> 16:26.996
you got to admit, it's perfect as it is.

16:27.815 --> 16:28.883
And?

16:28.916 --> 16:31.386
And I don't want anything to change.

16:31.418 --> 16:34.788
This huge event with all
these huge expectations,

16:34.822 --> 16:36.857
I'm worried it will change,

16:36.890 --> 16:40.394
and I don't want
to risk this for a party.

16:41.229 --> 16:42.999
I just want to be with Bex,

16:43.597 --> 16:45.599
and to be your dad

16:45.633 --> 16:47.869
and for the three of us to be happy.

16:47.902 --> 16:50.238
I don't really care about anything else.

16:51.009 --> 16:52.349
Okay.

16:53.581 --> 16:54.582
Okay?

16:55.509 --> 16:56.711
Yeah.

16:56.744 --> 16:59.214
I mean, it's your decision.

16:59.246 --> 17:01.382
But it affects you.

17:01.416 --> 17:06.753
Obviously you must be angry
or frustrated or sad.

17:07.454 --> 17:08.455
Are you?

17:09.257 --> 17:13.996
Well, what I'm feeling is...
not surprised.

17:14.928 --> 17:17.232
I guess that deep down,

17:17.263 --> 17:19.834
I always knew that this was
never going to happen.

17:23.204 --> 17:26.441
I'm gonna go work on
the costume in AndiShack.

17:31.312 --> 17:33.014
I was gonna make dinner.

17:33.046 --> 17:34.915
I'll just get take-out.

17:34.948 --> 17:36.618
If you see CeCe...

17:36.856 --> 17:39.059
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

17:41.555 --> 17:43.524
I'm not breaking CeCe's heart.

17:45.626 --> 17:46.927
You get to do that.

18:01.976 --> 18:03.978
- Thanks.
- Hey, Andi!

18:04.911 --> 18:06.014
Hi!

18:06.046 --> 18:07.523
If I'd known you were getting take-out,

18:07.547 --> 18:10.047
I would have thrown in
a free piece of cake.

18:10.318 --> 18:12.096
To thank you.

18:12.552 --> 18:15.444
No thanks or cake necessary.

18:16.023 --> 18:18.860
All right, well, I have to
go start my shift.

18:18.892 --> 18:20.995
I'll text you later, J-Bear.

18:22.983 --> 18:24.352
Hold on.

18:25.433 --> 18:26.835
I'll walk out with you.

18:31.238 --> 18:34.241
I have a ton to do on
the costume before tomorrow.

18:34.274 --> 18:35.744
What's up?

18:35.776 --> 18:37.554
I forgot how much work it is
being with Amber.

18:37.578 --> 18:38.879
Yeah, well...

18:38.912 --> 18:41.631
It's not just hearting her InstaPics.

18:42.249 --> 18:43.633
I have to text her all the time

18:43.658 --> 18:45.928
and take selfies and hang out
with her friends and...

18:46.353 --> 18:48.590
Amber's not asking that much of you,

18:48.828 --> 18:50.620
just regular boyfriend stuff.

18:50.645 --> 18:52.247
It's a lot of stuff.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.616
Jonah, do what you want to do,

18:54.648 --> 18:57.611
and don't do what you don't want
to do, either way, it's fine.

18:57.651 --> 18:59.171
You just have to decide what you want.

19:01.229 --> 19:03.731
Look, I'm having a day. I gotta go.

19:06.173 --> 19:08.042
I know you can do this.

19:09.230 --> 19:10.566
Are you okay?

19:19.388 --> 19:21.624
- Hey.
- Where's your costume?

19:21.657 --> 19:23.702
Without you, this is
embarrassingly straight-forward.

19:23.726 --> 19:26.662
- Yeah, I was gonna call...
- Come on, Kippen. Let's see it.

19:29.732 --> 19:31.300
"Double dribble."

19:31.332 --> 19:32.472
Get it?

19:32.947 --> 19:34.950
No, actually...

19:36.304 --> 19:38.807
Come on, let's go show
the guys on your team.

19:38.841 --> 19:41.477
Sorry, last-minute decision.
I should have called.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.646
I'm sorry.

19:47.475 --> 19:49.144
Where my heads at?

19:49.384 --> 19:52.687
Amazing! Of course, not surprised.

19:52.712 --> 19:55.516
Hey, Marty. Not into Costume Day?

19:55.548 --> 19:57.818
He's here to do Mount Rushmore with us.

19:57.843 --> 20:00.179
But all the spots are taken.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.143
Actually, Cyrus can't do it.

20:03.223 --> 20:04.415
Why not?

20:04.440 --> 20:07.097
What does it matter?
We have enough heads.

20:07.661 --> 20:10.170
Pivoting, pivoting...

20:11.359 --> 20:14.464
Thanks, Marty. Now all we need is Jonah.

20:14.496 --> 20:16.252
Oh, here he comes.

20:18.035 --> 20:19.520
Okay, so here's the plan.

20:19.545 --> 20:21.489
Buffy and I are doing makeup,
and then we'll all...

20:21.513 --> 20:23.503
Actually, can I talk to you?

20:23.969 --> 20:25.572
Alone?

20:31.978 --> 20:33.905
I thought a lot about
what you said last night.

20:33.930 --> 20:34.945
Okay.

20:34.970 --> 20:37.272
About deciding what I want
and participating,

20:37.297 --> 20:39.578
and not just being there because
someone expects me to be.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.955
I'm glad to hear it, but can
we talk about Amber later?

20:42.980 --> 20:44.182
This isn't about Amber.

20:45.150 --> 20:46.517
Then what?

20:46.550 --> 20:48.629
I don't want to be part of your costume.

20:48.654 --> 20:50.156
I'm just not a costume guy.

20:51.309 --> 20:53.745
I was just going along
because you wanted me to.

20:53.770 --> 20:56.702
Does no one honor
their commitments anymore?

20:58.028 --> 21:00.168
I was counting on you.

21:00.865 --> 21:02.009
You told me that you would do it,

21:02.033 --> 21:03.836
and you knew how much it meant to me.

21:03.869 --> 21:05.631
But you told me I should
decide what I want.

21:05.656 --> 21:07.859
About Amber, not the costume.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.634
Wrong lesson.

21:09.715 --> 21:10.882
I'm sorry.

21:17.014 --> 21:20.117
Another Mount Rushmore
costume dream dashed.

21:20.245 --> 21:21.948
Jonah bailed?

21:23.268 --> 21:24.437
Cyrus?

21:26.258 --> 21:27.593
Cyrus?

21:28.226 --> 21:30.696
Jonah can't do the costume.

21:31.443 --> 21:34.747
Oh, I get it. Salt.

21:35.806 --> 21:38.510
Nope. Thomas Jefferson.

22:02.443 --> 22:03.676
Next on Andi Mack...

22:03.709 --> 22:05.980
You're not the one running
a marathon this weekend.

22:06.007 --> 22:07.442
I wanna run a marathon, too.

22:07.474 --> 22:08.809
Without training?

22:08.843 --> 22:10.345
Don't even think about it.

22:10.377 --> 22:13.981
- You'll hurt yourself.
- Or you're afraid I'll beat you.

22:14.273 --> 22:15.876
- Buffy?
- Whoa.

22:16.410 --> 22:18.090
Your parents really
aren't getting married?

22:18.318 --> 22:20.288
You must be heartbroken.

22:20.320 --> 22:24.019
What am I supposed to do with
this ball of rage I'm holding?

22:24.044 --> 22:25.412
I don't have anywhere to put it.

22:26.399 --> 22:27.768
I do.
