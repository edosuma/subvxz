00:55.222 --> 00:58.225
Oh, wise and gentle soul.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.442
Do you remember...

01:11.738 --> 01:13.448
when we had it all?

01:18.662 --> 01:19.746
Do you dream...

01:22.583 --> 01:24.126
of when we had to leave?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.530
When you led us out...

01:58.869 --> 02:01.163
and how it all began.

03:37.509 --> 03:42.764
Our story starts beside a water hole
that was filled by the storm.

03:52.316 --> 03:56.778
Among the great herds here
are the world's last giant tuskers.

03:59.406 --> 04:04.036
Descendants of a noble lineage
that once stretched across Africa.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.638
Queen of them all is Athena.

04:32.940 --> 04:37.611
She is a 50-year-old matriarch,
head of her extended family.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.033
Like most of us, she has neighbors.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.661
And this is their story too.

04:51.041 --> 04:55.087
Her family is made up
of female relatives and their calves.

05:08.809 --> 05:13.897
They are so close that the youngsters
might as well be brothers and sisters.

05:21.613 --> 05:25.492
Athena's family rely
on her experience and wisdom,

05:26.076 --> 05:29.496
for she makes the decisions
that determine their survival.

05:32.499 --> 05:36.170
Her most recent daughter, Princess,
is a year old,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.589
and calm, like her mother.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.387
Then there's Wewe,

05:46.096 --> 05:47.514
the herd's naughty boy.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.653
He's always trying
to make friends with Princess.

06:02.613 --> 06:07.075
But he tries too hard,
and often it just gets him into trouble.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.258
As a boy, Wewe will stay
with the family until he's a teenager

06:24.343 --> 06:27.179
and then leave home
to join an all-male herd.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.768
Mimi is the family's newest arrival.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.937
She was born in the storm.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.401
It's day one for her
on a lifetime of learning.

06:51.036 --> 06:54.831
For the next two years, she'll be
totally dependent on her mother's milk.

07:00.087 --> 07:04.216
Her mother, Mala,
gives birth only once in five years,

07:04.842 --> 07:07.094
which makes every calf precious.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.060
While Mala might be the one who feeds her,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.855
Mimi will be cherished by them all,

07:18.397 --> 07:21.066
for it takes a herd
to raise an elephant calf.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.251
This is Athena's kingdom.

07:39.877 --> 07:42.504
For now, it has everything they need.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.511
Every day she brings her family
to the main water hole,

07:51.305 --> 07:53.307
which can be a nuisance for her neighbors.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.145
But they need the elephants

07:59.897 --> 08:03.650
'cause they made the water hole
and now keep it open.

08:12.993 --> 08:17.664
But for bullfrog, it can feel
like the construction never ends.

08:32.346 --> 08:36.058
Most of the family's neighbors
live at elephant toenail height.

08:39.811 --> 08:45.025
In one way or another,
they all depend on their giant friends.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.664
The water hole is home to them all.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.583
But from the moment the sun comes out,

09:02.960 --> 09:04.169
it starts to shrink.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.256
So the race is on to raise their families.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.261
Bullfrog is on it immediately,

09:13.220 --> 09:15.305
and there will be tadpoles in no time.

09:20.394 --> 09:23.897
Beneath them,
the killifish have no way of knowing

09:23.981 --> 09:27.150
how or when
Athena's family will help them.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.154
For now,
they have eyes only for each other.

09:36.326 --> 09:40.038
Each time the male hugs the female,
she lays an egg...

09:42.082 --> 09:43.125
and then buries it.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.981
With nightfall, Athena knows
she has to be especially vigilant.

10:06.773 --> 10:11.195
So her family will sleep on their feet
to better protect Wewe and Mimi.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.041
But for some of their neighbors...

10:26.627 --> 10:28.670
the party is just getting going.

10:45.312 --> 10:50.192
If you're a female foam frog,
a single partner is simply not enough.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.904
She invites a whole crowd to a foam party.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.329
It's the first event of the season
at Athena's water hole.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.253
She'll lay her eggs
in the froth whipped up by the males,

11:10.295 --> 11:12.256
and they will develop safely inside.

11:21.974 --> 11:25.269
Up above,
an Egyptian goose is a step ahead.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.691
She laid her eggs a few weeks ago.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.074
It will be two months
before her chicks are ready to fly.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.663
Until then,
the water hole will be their home.

12:02.723 --> 12:06.310
With Mimi so young,
Athena won't move far from the water.

12:07.477 --> 12:12.232
She's always cautious until a newborn
starts to put on weight and gets stronger.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.488
It's the first time
Wewe has met someone younger,

12:19.406 --> 12:21.533
and he's doing his best to make friends.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.850
While some are getting started
with their nests,

12:47.434 --> 12:48.977
others are finishing up.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.189
It's been a long night for the foam frogs,

12:53.398 --> 12:54.858
and they're beginning to tire.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.075
But for one reveler,
at least there's a taxi ride home.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.218
Sometimes,
a foam frog gets taken for a ride

13:21.718 --> 13:22.970
whether he wants it or not.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.498
The foam frog is happy
to sit out in the sun.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.794
But it can burn a baby's skin,

13:56.503 --> 13:59.673
so Wewe shows Mimi
where best to find shade.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.272
While the living is easy,

14:15.355 --> 14:18.817
Athena can relax
and allow the babies to rest.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.865
But Wewe never goes down for long.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.826
He's excited by Mimi's arrival

14:28.285 --> 14:30.746
and would rather try
and wake his new friend to play.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.214
Mimi must rest while she can.

14:41.715 --> 14:45.260
She needs to get strong
so she can keep up with her family.

14:54.478 --> 14:58.190
Mother Goose wants to get her chicks
to the safety of the water hole.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.319
It's day one for them too.

15:02.736 --> 15:06.073
And after a tiring night,
they are in no hurry.

15:10.202 --> 15:15.249
Besides, what she's proposing
requires a huge leap of faith.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.512
They've a conflict of instinct

15:28.595 --> 15:32.057
between wanting to stay together
and joining their parents.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.809
It takes just a flyby to convince them

16:16.476 --> 16:20.898
that their best chance of surviving
is to stick close to Mum and Dad.

16:27.946 --> 16:31.491
In any family, there is always one
who is last and late.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.619
We'll call him Stephen.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.998
The parents rely
on their young keeping up with them,

16:38.498 --> 16:41.001
so they don't know
that Stephen's left behind.

17:45.232 --> 17:49.319
Just occasionally,
last and late is also lucky.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.830
Athena's knowledge of the kingdom

17:59.913 --> 18:03.500
has been handed down
from mother to daughter over centuries.

18:05.836 --> 18:08.422
Her tusks are the largest
of any matriarch.

18:14.595 --> 18:17.890
The notch comes
from years of snagging grass and vines.

18:26.940 --> 18:31.111
The vines she likes most
flower for just a few days each year.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.572
And she knows just where to find them.

18:36.533 --> 18:39.536
The prospect of a feast
distracts the family

18:39.620 --> 18:41.538
from what's happening at toenail height,

18:42.539 --> 18:44.958
so it's up to her neighbors
to get out of the way.

18:57.221 --> 19:00.307
Chameleon relies
on her camouflage for protection.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.781
But there are times
when choosing to stay still and blend in

19:16.657 --> 19:18.408
is the worst decision to make.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.963
She's probably as close to panic

19:33.507 --> 19:35.217
as a chameleon ever comes.

20:04.872 --> 20:06.290
For Athena's family,

20:06.373 --> 20:09.877
life at home in the green season
acquires a gentle rhythm.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.505
She'll let them eat until it warms up

20:14.047 --> 20:15.924
and then lead them down for a drink.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.141
It's been only four days since the storm,

20:25.475 --> 20:28.187
but the foam frogs' nests
have baked in the sun.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.105
And they are ready.

20:49.499 --> 20:54.254
For the next few weeks, the water hole
will be home to the frogs' tiny tadpoles.

20:59.259 --> 21:02.596
As they hatch,
they'll go unnoticed by Athena's family,

21:05.265 --> 21:06.517
but they won't go unnoticed

21:06.600 --> 21:09.353
by the killifish and terrapins
living beneath them.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.619
Only the largest terrapin can reach them.

21:35.712 --> 21:40.467
His prize is a meringue
with a soft tadpole filling.

22:11.665 --> 22:13.584
It's Mimi's first time in the water.

22:14.418 --> 22:16.086
So she starts at the shallow end,

22:16.920 --> 22:18.881
and she needs no encouragement.

22:27.598 --> 22:31.101
For Athena's family, this is paradise.

22:36.690 --> 22:41.069
But unless it rains again,
the water holes will vanish within weeks.

22:45.324 --> 22:49.161
If that happens, Athena knows
they'll be forced out of the kingdom.

22:50.579 --> 22:53.332
So they must make the most
of this time of plenty.

23:02.674 --> 23:05.469
Princess learns what to eat
by copying her mum.

23:06.887 --> 23:08.639
But the babies are still on milk,

23:09.389 --> 23:13.227
which gives Wewe time
to brush up on his foot-and-trunk skills.

23:19.650 --> 23:23.153
But it will be months
before he achieves this level of control.

23:32.371 --> 23:35.040
Athena is aware
that there is a dry season coming.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.710
And the only way to prepare for it
is to put on weight.

23:39.837 --> 23:41.713
It means piling it in.

23:47.261 --> 23:50.180
But what goes in... must come out.

23:54.101 --> 23:57.396
For a dung beetle,
it is a gift from the gods.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.779
The message has traveled far and wide.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.865
And with others homing in,

24:50.824 --> 24:52.993
there's no time for a leisurely lunch.

24:54.203 --> 24:57.789
He needs to ball it up and roll it away
as quickly as possible,

24:58.665 --> 25:00.459
for there are bandits out there.

25:58.976 --> 26:03.021
The victor now has to find ground
soft enough to bury his ball

26:03.647 --> 26:05.524
so he can feed in peace.

26:13.657 --> 26:15.242
Besides feeding dung beetles,

26:15.993 --> 26:19.371
Athena's family provides the kingdom
with a free gardening service.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.128
Most of the seeds they eat
pass through them undigested,

26:27.087 --> 26:30.632
to be planted in neat balls of compost
wherever they go.

26:39.892 --> 26:41.768
Tortoise is waiting for someone.

26:43.687 --> 26:48.400
And for what he has in mind,
he needs to snack now while he can.

26:56.283 --> 27:01.830
With no sign of rain, every day is hotter
and tempers start to fray.

27:10.214 --> 27:13.217
With incoming elephants
and such a young family,

27:14.927 --> 27:17.012
the geese need to keep a safe distance.

27:18.555 --> 27:22.184
But with the water level dropping
and a hot herd,

27:22.267 --> 27:23.644
that becomes difficult.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.661
They know better than to react to a bully.

27:47.835 --> 27:52.047
So she decides to save face
by taking it out on a dove.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.916
Once again, Stephen's left it late.

28:28.542 --> 28:29.793
And he's left behind.

28:55.986 --> 28:58.322
And this time, he is lost.

29:08.207 --> 29:10.375
For tortoise, life is looking up.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.212
A female has come down to drink.

29:14.129 --> 29:16.673
He can intercept her easily enough.

29:17.216 --> 29:21.386
But to impress her, he has to prove
he has stamina equal to her own.

29:24.056 --> 29:25.682
And that means going for a walk.

29:28.352 --> 29:30.062
A long walk.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.783
Stephen has never seen
such creatures before.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.750
But he's going to have to get streetwise

29:51.834 --> 29:55.170
if he's to stand any chance
of being reunited with his family.

30:44.136 --> 30:45.512
From being last and late,

30:46.388 --> 30:49.224
Stephen has progressed
to being lost and lucky.

31:08.911 --> 31:13.040
Some of Athena's neighbors drop by
only when the grasslands start to dry

31:13.498 --> 31:14.666
and food is on offer.

31:17.586 --> 31:20.881
The bee-eaters join Athena's family
for just a few days,

31:21.673 --> 31:24.593
when the kingdom's grasshoppers
are at their juiciest.

31:26.261 --> 31:28.597
They rely on the family to flush them out.

31:52.955 --> 31:57.251
The bee-eaters' friendship will last
just as long as there are grasshoppers.

32:01.797 --> 32:04.758
As soon as they're finished,
the birds will move on.

32:11.139 --> 32:14.601
Stephen is as excited about grasshoppers
as anyone.

32:18.897 --> 32:22.734
He might lack ability, but not ambition.

32:29.408 --> 32:33.245
Down at toenail height,
dung beetle is still on a mission.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.332
He might look
like he's pushing his ball forwards,

32:37.416 --> 32:41.086
but he's actually upside down,
dribbling it backwards.

32:43.338 --> 32:46.466
He can't see where he's going,
but that doesn't bother him.

32:48.177 --> 32:52.014
His determination
is out of all proportion to his size.

32:53.765 --> 32:57.144
Now that he's got the ball,
he just hates to let go of it...

33:00.105 --> 33:02.608
no matter how big the opposition.

33:49.821 --> 33:51.823
Athena's team haven't scored,

33:51.907 --> 33:53.825
but they have kicked the ball out of play,

33:54.493 --> 33:57.788
which allows dung beetle
to regain possession.

34:12.177 --> 34:15.304
Athena's family rarely get
to meet some of their neighbors.

34:18.976 --> 34:22.603
Whenever the terrapins hear them coming,
they make themselves scarce.

34:42.875 --> 34:44.501
But the storm was weeks ago,

34:45.460 --> 34:49.547
and the water is now so shallow
that there's nowhere to hide.

35:03.645 --> 35:06.273
Even a killifish
finds himself high and dry.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.694
The water hole has been his entire world.

35:11.570 --> 35:15.824
But with so little water left,
his time is almost over.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.710
With the pool party getting rowdy,

35:27.836 --> 35:29.338
they all risk getting squashed.

35:33.008 --> 35:35.636
So those that can leave
make a break for it.

35:43.268 --> 35:45.479
And that just attracts attention.

36:09.795 --> 36:11.672
Elephants live tactile lives.

36:12.965 --> 36:16.927
They use their sensitive trunks and feet
to explore anything new.

36:18.554 --> 36:21.932
There's no malice here, just curiosity.

36:36.405 --> 36:39.449
In elephant society, aggression is rare...

36:42.911 --> 36:44.413
even between bulls

36:44.496 --> 36:47.624
when they join Athena's family
at the kingdom's salt lick.

36:51.253 --> 36:54.173
Instead, there's a greeting,

36:54.256 --> 36:56.300
a quiet acknowledgement of status...

36:58.135 --> 36:59.303
and then sharing.

37:24.703 --> 37:27.789
Mining the salt-rich soil takes practice.

37:28.832 --> 37:32.961
It's about foot-and-trunk coordination
and then breath control.

37:40.636 --> 37:42.638
For Wewe, it's a challenge.

37:44.556 --> 37:48.185
If he breathes too hard,
the tickly dust goes straight up his nose.

37:49.895 --> 37:52.648
But he's working on ways
to stop a sneeze from getting out.

38:08.205 --> 38:13.168
It's so distracting that, for a moment,
he loses sight of his friend.

38:30.769 --> 38:32.521
Mimi always seems to be hungry,

38:33.564 --> 38:35.107
yet she never suckles for long.

38:41.113 --> 38:43.866
It's the only time her big sister, Milly,
gets involved

38:45.033 --> 38:46.994
and tries to keep Wewe away.

38:51.957 --> 38:53.917
For Mala is not producing much milk...

38:56.795 --> 38:58.964
and Mimi needs every mouthful she can get.

39:15.147 --> 39:18.650
At the end of each day, everyone is tired.

39:25.407 --> 39:29.244
Mother Goose has no way of knowing
that Stephen is still missing.

40:01.443 --> 40:05.280
Throughout the kingdom, most
of the water holes have already dried,

40:06.031 --> 40:08.075
and Athena is getting restless.

40:09.368 --> 40:11.537
She knows now
that they will have to leave,

40:12.371 --> 40:16.458
but she's concerned that Mimi might not
be strong enough to make the journey.

40:19.628 --> 40:21.964
She seems to get hung up in situations

40:22.047 --> 40:24.341
that most babies
would take in their stride.

40:36.895 --> 40:40.816
For her friends, it's difficult to know
whether she's in trouble

40:40.899 --> 40:42.484
or just very tired.

40:52.995 --> 40:55.247
But when Athena rumbles, "Move on,"

40:55.831 --> 40:57.833
everyone has to fall in line.

41:01.753 --> 41:04.631
And for a baby elephant,
there is nothing worse

41:04.715 --> 41:07.176
than the prospect of being left behind.

41:18.770 --> 41:22.816
It's not just Athena who feels
the approach of a time of change.

41:28.363 --> 41:32.034
Almost overnight,
bullfrog's new family have grown legs

41:33.285 --> 41:36.747
and are now driven to leave the water
to start a life on land.

41:43.545 --> 41:47.674
Luckily for them,
their new bones are still very soft.

42:14.076 --> 42:17.538
But they'd rather not push their luck
with three tons of elephant.

42:49.361 --> 42:52.739
Athena hasn't set off
for their dry-season refuge yet

42:53.699 --> 42:55.701
because Mimi is struggling.

43:02.708 --> 43:04.543
She needs her mother's encouragement.

43:29.985 --> 43:33.363
With the dry season setting in,
there's no going back.

43:35.407 --> 43:38.535
But just occasionally, nature smiles

43:38.994 --> 43:41.038
and gives back what she took away.

44:11.443 --> 44:14.029
Hopefully, Stephen's night alone

44:14.112 --> 44:17.324
has shown him
just how much he needs his family.

44:25.707 --> 44:28.126
The last froglets
are now ready to come ashore.

44:29.711 --> 44:32.464
But those that emerged first are bigger,

44:33.632 --> 44:34.633
and they are waiting.

44:59.950 --> 45:02.202
For a bullfrog
to get the best start in life,

45:03.620 --> 45:07.249
it helps to have a big mouth
and small relatives.

45:22.514 --> 45:25.684
In the kingdom,
weeks without rain have taken their toll.

45:26.351 --> 45:28.812
But if Athena was ever
in doubt about what's coming,

45:29.271 --> 45:31.940
the arrival
of the great flocks confirms it.

45:53.212 --> 45:57.549
As the lands around dry,
quelea are forced to migrate.

46:17.694 --> 46:20.822
Their whirlwind arrival
can be overwhelming.

46:28.830 --> 46:33.001
And they'll drink in a day
what Athena's family drinks in a week.

47:02.614 --> 47:06.201
By the time they move on,
they've drunk the water hole dry.

47:18.380 --> 47:20.966
Athena's family
will use the mud as sunscreen.

47:22.092 --> 47:24.011
And this is vital for the killifish,

47:24.887 --> 47:27.306
for they left their eggs
hidden in the mud.

47:31.143 --> 47:33.979
They developed into tiny fish,
but never hatched.

47:35.480 --> 47:37.733
They can survive out of water for weeks.

47:38.984 --> 47:41.069
So when Athena's family move on,

47:41.486 --> 47:43.780
they will carry tiny passengers with them.

47:48.410 --> 47:52.539
In this way, the killifish babies
get to move between water holes

47:53.165 --> 47:54.499
by riding on elephants.

48:14.770 --> 48:16.855
Athena knows she should have left by now,

48:17.523 --> 48:21.360
but the nearest permanent water
is almost 100 miles away.

48:23.362 --> 48:27.366
And she delayed
in the hope that Mimi would get stronger.

48:32.955 --> 48:37.084
Mala is now so protective
that even Wewe is no longer welcome.

48:43.382 --> 48:46.134
Mimi's big sister, Milly,
can give her comfort

48:46.218 --> 48:49.137
but not the milk she so desperately needs.

48:52.516 --> 48:56.103
Only time will tell whether Athena's
decision to delay was the right one.

48:59.231 --> 49:00.649
She now has no choice.

49:01.900 --> 49:03.360
The kingdom is without water,

49:04.653 --> 49:06.655
and ahead of them the pools are drying.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.450
They must head for the refuge.

49:48.697 --> 49:51.575
Mala and Milly now work together.

50:36.828 --> 50:38.580
However much Athena might want to,

50:39.164 --> 50:43.961
as matriarch, she cannot put Mimi's needs
above those of the whole family.

51:18.620 --> 51:20.956
While Mala and Mimi head down to drink,

51:21.790 --> 51:23.959
Athena will take the others to feed,

51:24.543 --> 51:27.045
for she must try
to balance everyone's needs.

52:21.266 --> 52:26.021
Mimi's desperation to drink can only mean
that Mala's milk has dried up.

52:27.606 --> 52:28.774
But Mala can't know that.

52:29.942 --> 52:33.445
She knows that a weak calf
can easily become trapped in mud,

52:34.279 --> 52:37.824
and her instinct is to do
everything she can to keep Mimi away.

53:24.329 --> 53:25.956
Mimi is not yet weaned.

53:26.498 --> 53:28.500
So if she's not been getting milk,

53:29.168 --> 53:30.752
she's not been getting food.

54:03.285 --> 54:06.413
There are times when a mother
needs her daughter's support.

54:19.510 --> 54:21.428
It's what family is for.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.473
The next day, it is hotter,

55:07.015 --> 55:09.601
and Athena's predicament, even worse.

55:13.939 --> 55:16.149
She doesn't want to leave Mimi behind,

55:16.233 --> 55:19.069
but neither can she
put her entire family at risk.

55:30.789 --> 55:33.041
Athena knows
that they've reached the last pool.

55:34.126 --> 55:36.170
And today it will dry.

55:39.798 --> 55:44.303
A terrapin senses it too and will dig deep
into the mud while he can.

55:46.221 --> 55:50.309
He'd rather risk being stepped on
than caught out by the dry season.

56:03.238 --> 56:05.365
Mala will never give up.

56:41.610 --> 56:46.573
But in the end,
Mimi's tiny heart can take her no further.

59:35.617 --> 59:38.412
For a mother, there is nothing worse.

01:00:00.559 --> 01:00:04.897
Sometimes, however sad,
there is release in death.

01:00:21.496 --> 01:00:25.667
But for Wewe,
the loss of his friend is especially hard.

01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:41.558
Athena knows
she cannot afford another delay.

01:00:42.601 --> 01:00:45.687
It will take three days
to reach the dry-season refuge.

01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:48.106
And she has left it so late

01:00:49.107 --> 01:00:51.527
that there is nowhere
they can drink on the way.

01:01:10.879 --> 01:01:13.674
There is no time to stop and comfort Wewe.

01:01:36.822 --> 01:01:38.991
Behind them, where there was a water hole,

01:01:39.491 --> 01:01:42.536
is now the soft ground
that dung beetle's been looking for.

01:01:49.918 --> 01:01:52.129
The killifish are but a memory.

01:01:58.093 --> 01:02:02.598
Bullfrog will dig down to spend
the next months deep below ground.

01:02:08.187 --> 01:02:10.522
It's been two months
since Stephen hatched.

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:13.525
And the young geese are now fully grown.

01:02:27.039 --> 01:02:29.249
They, too, will head for the refuge...

01:02:40.219 --> 01:02:43.263
following the same paths as the elephants.

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:51.563
Every day,
Athena stops briefly so they can feed.

01:02:55.984 --> 01:02:57.528
They are kinder to Wewe now.

01:02:58.487 --> 01:03:00.280
Even Princess is more tolerant.

01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:17.506
Milly has no milk to give,

01:03:18.173 --> 01:03:20.759
but Wewe's suckling
will comfort them both.

01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:43.031
Athena's route out of the kingdom
is a mind map of elephant paths

01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:47.286
that she learned from her mother
and has never forgotten.

01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:55.711
There are badlands to cross.

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:04.446
But they don't walk alone.

01:05:05.906 --> 01:05:08.325
All are heading for the refuge.

01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:38.063
The refuge is a water hole
fed from underground.

01:05:39.189 --> 01:05:42.860
Even at the height of the dry season,
there is water for all.

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:21.648
Along with the elephants,
Stephen's family will be refugees,

01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:26.403
waiting here until the rains come
and they can all go home.

01:07:13.867 --> 01:07:16.578
Athena comes here
only in the driest years.

01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:22.042
It is the one occasion
that her status as monarch is equaled.

01:07:56.994 --> 01:08:01.206
This is Satao, king of them all.

01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:05.586
A tusker of mythical proportions.

01:08:14.845 --> 01:08:17.305
He is a gentle giant...

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:20.975
to whom all defer.

01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:17.866
He's been out in the wilderness all year

01:09:18.825 --> 01:09:22.203
and will use this occasion to see
if any female is in season.

01:09:34.508 --> 01:09:37.135
Nusu is a young female
from Athena's family.

01:09:38.428 --> 01:09:39.763
But she's heavily pregnant.

01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:04.955
For the first time since Mimi died,
Wewe enjoys himself.

01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:10.836
It's a chance for him
to meet calves from other families.

01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:23.056
And when he's exhausted from playing,
there's always his family to help out.

01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:46.413
As the dry season progresses,
food at the refuge becomes scarce.

01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:56.507
So each evening, Athena's family
must travel further to feed.

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.909
After every journey out,
they must all come back to water.

01:11:38.465 --> 01:11:39.675
It is their lifeline.

01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:43.136
But it ties them to the refuge,

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.347
and the knot is slowly tightening.

01:11:55.148 --> 01:11:58.902
They have little energy,
for almost everything has been eaten.

01:12:01.572 --> 01:12:05.909
What started out as a refuge
has gradually turned into a prison.

01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:19.173
When the rains don't arrive,

01:12:19.756 --> 01:12:22.968
what began as a dry season
turns into a drought.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.639
And the consequences
and casualties start to build.

01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:56.543
Athena dares not leave,

01:12:57.211 --> 01:13:00.130
for there is no other water
within walking distance.

01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:23.028
In such a drought,
what kills is not thirst but starvation.

01:13:27.324 --> 01:13:31.036
For them all, it is only a matter of time.

01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:12.244
In her 50 years, Athena has never
experienced a drought so bad.

01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:21.420
The decision she now has to make
has never been more critical.

01:14:31.471 --> 01:14:34.975
This time, the lives of her entire family
are at stake.

01:14:36.643 --> 01:14:39.271
If she stays, they will starve.

01:14:40.647 --> 01:14:42.608
But if she leaves and times it wrong,

01:14:43.567 --> 01:14:44.985
they will all die of thirst.

01:14:49.573 --> 01:14:54.369
Whatever the outcome,
the responsibility is hers alone.

01:15:13.096 --> 01:15:14.598
Such is their faith in her,

01:15:15.516 --> 01:15:19.811
that when she decides to head
back to the kingdom, no one hesitates.

01:15:25.943 --> 01:15:27.986
For she is their matriarch.

01:15:29.613 --> 01:15:31.281
They would follow her anywhere.

01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:24.543
Back in her kingdom, it is no better.

01:16:54.531 --> 01:17:00.704
Where the water hole was, those
that dug down are alive but entombed,

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:07.294
trapped in a state of suspended animation.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.476
For them all, for the spell to be broken,

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:24.686
it must rain.

01:17:43.497 --> 01:17:44.873
Out in the badlands,

01:17:45.499 --> 01:17:48.335
the family do their best
to protect Wewe from the sun.

01:18:03.642 --> 01:18:06.395
But he has to walk two steps to their one.

01:18:12.526 --> 01:18:14.444
And that takes its toll.

01:18:53.567 --> 01:18:55.444
When Athena finally stops,

01:18:56.361 --> 01:19:01.074
it's not to look for food
but to remember one of their own.

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:30.771
For a few moments,
the drought is forgotten

01:19:31.522 --> 01:19:34.441
as they join in an understanding
of what was

01:19:35.734 --> 01:19:38.570
and what it means to be one of their kind.

01:20:12.646 --> 01:20:15.691
Where they are heading
is still gripped by the drought.

01:21:08.285 --> 01:21:10.704
With the kingdom just a day's walk away,

01:21:11.538 --> 01:21:15.042
there is only one thing
that could cause Athena to stop.

01:21:24.843 --> 01:21:27.471
After carrying her baby
for almost two years,

01:21:29.056 --> 01:21:30.724
Nusu has given birth.

01:21:35.646 --> 01:21:37.314
Her baby is a girl.

01:21:45.239 --> 01:21:47.491
She knows nothing
of what she's been born into.

01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:53.163
Her priority is to find her first meal.

01:22:03.006 --> 01:22:06.218
As ever, Wewe is eager to make friends.

01:22:44.715 --> 01:22:47.342
It would seem the worst time to be born.

01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:54.349
But Athena knows differently.

01:22:57.269 --> 01:23:01.190
For thousands of years, her kind were
thought to be able to summon the rain.

01:23:03.483 --> 01:23:07.237
The truth is
that she could sense rain coming

01:23:07.321 --> 01:23:09.406
when it was over 100 miles away.

01:23:39.686 --> 01:23:43.065
There is only one way
to rebalance the kingdom.

01:24:37.369 --> 01:24:39.538
It's been a year
since they saw water flow,

01:24:40.038 --> 01:24:41.415
and it comes as a shock.

01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:09.735
In Africa, to be born on the cusp
of the rains is a sign of good fortune.

01:25:12.696 --> 01:25:14.990
For rain is always cause for celebration.

01:25:57.241 --> 01:26:01.912
Once again, the elephant paths
will channel water to fill water holes.

01:26:17.177 --> 01:26:19.972
Underground, the rain is a wake-up call.

01:28:03.617 --> 01:28:06.703
Just as every smile
leaves its impression on a face,

01:28:07.704 --> 01:28:11.124
so every journey
leaves its imprint on this continent.

01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:20.259
The young geese
are still a tight-knit group.

01:28:21.301 --> 01:28:24.513
But it won't be long before they start
to look for mates of their own.

01:28:38.402 --> 01:28:42.739
And true to form,
Stephen is last and late.

01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:07.097
Tortoise's courtship
has been slow and steady,

01:29:08.348 --> 01:29:10.267
but he has finally been accepted.

01:29:37.794 --> 01:29:41.882
Once again, the water hole
will be a lifeline for them all.

01:30:00.484 --> 01:30:03.779
For Wewe, there is no place like home.

01:30:07.407 --> 01:30:10.953
And there is nothing quite like
having a new friend to share it with.

01:30:25.759 --> 01:30:28.762
Great droughts bring great rains.

01:30:30.264 --> 01:30:34.309
And the kingdom's flush of new growth
draws in other families

01:30:34.393 --> 01:30:36.854
in a way that hasn't happened for decades.

01:30:53.954 --> 01:30:58.625
For a few days,
they form a super-herd, 1,000 strong.

01:30:59.418 --> 01:31:02.713
The largest gathering of their kind
on the planet.

01:31:32.326 --> 01:31:35.454
The journey has brought
Wewe and Princess together

01:31:36.455 --> 01:31:39.166
and has been the first step
in acquiring the knowledge

01:31:39.249 --> 01:31:41.251
that will help them through their lives.

01:31:44.296 --> 01:31:46.465
There will be more droughts to face,

01:31:47.591 --> 01:31:51.803
but Athena's family will never forget
the extraordinary matriarch

01:31:52.471 --> 01:31:55.641
who led them out... and brought them home.

01:32:20.958 --> 01:32:24.127
Only a handful
of such giant tuskers remain.

01:32:29.883 --> 01:32:34.596
Today, this small corner of the continent
still belongs to them.

01:32:39.226 --> 01:32:42.354
It reminds us of how it once was...

01:32:45.148 --> 01:32:48.193
when the whole of Africa was theirs.

01:32:49.305 --> 01:32:55.505
