- Not you.

00:05.898 --> 00:07.375
- Okay.
- Oh, uh, yeah, but just for a bit

00:07.399 --> 00:08.572
while, uh, Gloria and Joe

00:08.658 --> 00:10.620
go through some of your
old toys in the garage.

00:10.854 --> 00:12.120
- I'll fly there.
- Mm-hmm.

00:12.190 --> 00:13.340
GLORIA: Okay, <i>vamanos!</i>

00:13.431 --> 00:14.733
Kid loves that cape.

00:14.806 --> 00:18.053
So, I see your stance on sons
wearing accessories has evolved.

00:18.166 --> 00:20.330
The cape gives him superpowers.

00:20.534 --> 00:22.015
What did leg warmers give you?

00:22.088 --> 00:23.776
Flair. They gave me flair.

00:23.932 --> 00:25.228
Leave me alone, okay?

00:25.276 --> 00:26.838
Everybody, leave me alone.

00:26.924 --> 00:28.034
Hey! What's all that?

00:28.127 --> 00:30.183
(sighs) I just... I'm sorry.
I just need a night away.

00:30.207 --> 00:31.341
- Here. Want to help?
- I don't do that.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.393
Okay.

00:32.497 --> 00:33.629
It's just... it's been a lot recently,

00:33.653 --> 00:35.687
you know, coming off
of a really long trial,

00:35.773 --> 00:37.768
Cam's spring cleaning frenzy,

00:37.862 --> 00:40.151
hauling Lily all over for softball,

00:40.225 --> 00:41.729
pretending to care about softball.

00:41.802 --> 00:43.502
Oh, I get needing time away.

00:43.566 --> 00:45.182
I was married to your mother.

00:45.366 --> 00:46.909
Like you are now.

00:47.330 --> 00:48.565
I have it all planned out.

00:48.629 --> 00:49.830
I drive to the desert.

00:49.901 --> 00:51.299
I check into the Markham...

00:51.397 --> 00:53.424
a few hours by the pool, massage,

00:53.511 --> 00:55.913
then I head downstairs
for a juicy steak frites,

00:55.969 --> 00:58.096
just me and my book,
which can't talk to me.

00:58.255 --> 00:59.674
- So do it.
- (sighs)

00:59.751 --> 01:01.541
Asking Cam to go away alone

01:01.615 --> 01:03.424
is three weeks of wounded crazy

01:03.507 --> 01:05.181
that I... I don't want
to deal with right now.

01:05.205 --> 01:08.432
Don't ask, tell. Isn't
that what you fought for?

01:08.674 --> 01:10.284
Okay, I don't know
what to address first.

01:10.350 --> 01:12.185
Uh, Jay, Gloria's ready to go.

01:12.416 --> 01:13.745
All right. Take it easy.

01:17.034 --> 01:18.210

01:18.260 --> 01:19.768
Why'd he call you Mrs. Tucker?

01:19.830 --> 01:21.642
Why does he wear those
boxy jeans? I don't know.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.442
No, seriously. W-Why
is he messing with you?

01:23.510 --> 01:25.073
(sighs) All right, yeah, what the hell.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.893
Um, I told him how I would love to go

01:27.954 --> 01:29.260
to the desert for a night.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.307
- Okay, yeah. Fun. Let's go!
- Hold, please.

01:31.408 --> 01:34.549
How I would love to go to
the desert for a night alone.

01:34.689 --> 01:36.478
- I don't care.
- All right.

01:36.535 --> 01:38.151
If you want to go alone,
go alone. I don't care.

01:38.175 --> 01:39.842
Oh, see, you said "I don't care" twice.

01:39.898 --> 01:41.557
Because that's
how much I don't care.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.687
Why are you still here?

01:42.829 --> 01:45.104
Cam, don't be hurt. I'm
not running from you.

01:45.179 --> 01:46.539
- Here.
- And I'm not folding that.

01:46.585 --> 01:48.534
I just wanted a night alone, okay?

01:48.629 --> 01:50.032
Lily's going to that
sleepover tonight.

01:50.056 --> 01:52.174
- It seemed like a good night to do it.
- So, go!

01:52.216 --> 01:53.846
You know, I don't love the implication

01:53.924 --> 01:56.385
that I'm so needy I can't
spend one night by myself.

01:56.444 --> 01:57.588
I didn't say that.

01:57.671 --> 01:59.276
You didn't not say that.

01:59.330 --> 02:00.570
And you're not not being needy.

02:00.676 --> 02:03.588
Well, to show you how not needy I am,

02:03.709 --> 02:07.284
I... will pack your bag for you.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.558

07:24.001 --> 07:25.777
- Where is it...
- It's right... it's right...

07:25.801 --> 07:27.509
- You got it right there.
- Ah! Damn it!

07:27.580 --> 07:30.064
- (sighs)
- (laughing) I mean, the crazy thing is

07:30.168 --> 07:33.462
I'm happy Dylan found that old
lady with those hideous kids.

07:33.783 --> 07:35.090
I mean, how funny is it

07:35.150 --> 07:36.829
(voice breaking) that he
is the one that settled down

07:36.853 --> 07:38.779
and is doing so great
while I'm alone

07:38.906 --> 07:40.831
basically forever?

07:40.903 --> 07:41.931
(laughs)

07:42.039 --> 07:44.058
Could you please go be
tragic somewhere else?

07:44.083 --> 07:45.103
- (pounding)
- (gasps)

07:45.168 --> 07:47.313
- Dylan, are you back?
- LUKE: I'm fixing the banister!

07:47.337 --> 07:48.798
(groans) This is a nightmare!

07:48.860 --> 07:50.033
You're not better than us.

07:50.124 --> 07:51.447
I am so much better than you!

07:51.570 --> 07:53.502
I'm not the one with
the pen up her nose.

07:53.676 --> 07:54.951
(groans)

07:55.023 --> 07:56.408
At least I have a boyfriend.

07:56.455 --> 07:58.048
(gasps) Who says that?

07:58.141 --> 07:59.744
- Uh-oh!
- Oh, God.

07:59.808 --> 08:01.211
- Oh, God!
- Haley crying about Dylan,

08:01.235 --> 08:03.539
Alex freaking out about school,
this is like a big déjà vu.

08:03.563 --> 08:05.009
No, déjà vu is when you imagine

08:05.056 --> 08:06.068
that you've seen
something before.

08:06.092 --> 08:07.952
This is just vu!

08:08.603 --> 08:10.548
In hindsight, I should
have pulled my head out

08:10.625 --> 08:12.158
before I nailed the post back in.

08:12.306 --> 08:13.654
Buddy...

08:13.752 --> 08:16.041
- Live and learn.
- If only you ever did.

08:16.113 --> 08:17.171
(groans)

08:17.227 --> 08:18.369
Okay.

08:18.394 --> 08:20.416
I think I may have
gone too deep this time.

08:20.462 --> 08:22.845
Sweet Caligula, that's a lot of blood.

08:22.945 --> 08:24.822
Why would Dylan change
his phone number?

08:24.927 --> 08:27.478
Do you know how long it took
him to memorize the last one?!

08:27.509 --> 08:28.720
Both sides now?

08:28.772 --> 08:30.267
Don't hate this glue smell.

08:30.315 --> 08:32.707
Now comes the blood-loss migraine.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.474
Oh, you know what? I-I
can go get some medicine.

08:34.498 --> 08:35.798
Oh, no. You know, I can do that.

08:35.861 --> 08:37.111
Actually, my car's blocking your car.

08:37.135 --> 08:38.568
Yeah, that's not a
big deal. You know why?

08:38.592 --> 08:42.227
Because I can take your
car instead of mine! Bye!

08:43.802 --> 08:46.533
No. No, no, no! No way!

08:47.754 --> 08:49.502
- Oh, my God.
- Knock it off!

08:49.630 --> 08:51.033
Mind your own business!

08:51.090 --> 08:52.190
I would love to.

08:52.278 --> 08:54.337
But now I'm wondering
if all that gasping

08:54.390 --> 08:55.861
is about something I've already read

08:55.949 --> 08:57.173
or something coming up!

08:57.227 --> 08:58.619
I'm on page 312.

08:58.728 --> 08:59.994
Don't tell me that!

09:00.136 --> 09:02.771
Now I know there's a
gasp coming in 20 pages.

09:03.072 --> 09:04.384
(chuckles)

09:04.645 --> 09:07.165
Of course. You're following me.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.306
Oh, I-I'm sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

09:10.399 --> 09:12.267
What the hell did I just witness?

09:12.345 --> 09:14.103
Oh, good Lord.

09:14.834 --> 09:17.142
Oh! Good Lord!

09:17.525 --> 09:20.033
Tell me about this
sea bass special again.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.028
Mediterranean prep, en papillote...

09:22.108 --> 09:23.791
Oh. Really?

09:23.898 --> 09:25.432
Yeah. Baked in paper

09:25.512 --> 09:27.072
with tomato, red pepper,

09:27.147 --> 09:28.647
capers, onion, olives.

09:28.728 --> 09:30.345
Literally my favorite fish dish.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.369
Would you recommend
that over the steak?

09:32.455 --> 09:35.048
Hey, I was kind of in the
middle of my own thing here.

09:35.439 --> 09:37.002
Would you recommend it over the steak?

09:37.127 --> 09:38.650
- They're both great.
- Fine. Steak.

09:38.696 --> 09:39.696
Stick with the plan.

09:39.721 --> 09:41.697
And I'll have a glass
of the Merryvale Cab.

09:41.767 --> 09:43.017
Yeah, me too. Thank you.

09:43.086 --> 09:44.611
Sorry, the Merryvale Ca...

09:44.696 --> 09:46.666
uh, doesn't come by the glass.

09:46.766 --> 09:48.400
It-it seems like you
two know each other.

09:48.456 --> 09:50.314
You could split the fish and steak

09:50.391 --> 09:52.197
and share the bottle of wine.

09:52.345 --> 09:53.505
Not doing that.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.048
Never said we were.

09:55.275 --> 09:56.842
This is actually my dad.

09:56.892 --> 10:00.439
I came here for some alone
time, but he copycatted me.

10:00.580 --> 10:01.720
He said he wasn't coming

10:01.824 --> 10:04.058
because his scary
partner said he couldn't.

10:04.197 --> 10:05.947
Scary husband!

10:06.052 --> 10:07.252
Still hits my ear wrong.

10:07.353 --> 10:10.166
Wow. So, you're not even gonna...

10:10.524 --> 10:11.669
I-I'm sorry.

10:11.717 --> 10:14.447
Uh, just, my dad passed
away when I was 10,

10:14.527 --> 10:16.353
and I'd love to have
dinner with him again.

10:16.517 --> 10:19.119
Oh, Austin. That's so sad.

10:19.232 --> 10:20.627
Terrible story.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.541
Makes you think.

10:23.293 --> 10:24.931
Anyway, I'll have a
glass of any of the reds.

10:24.955 --> 10:26.627
White for me. Thank you.

10:28.185 --> 10:30.611
I'm sorry, buddy. I didn't
mean to pull your leg so hard.

10:30.727 --> 10:33.447
- What?!
- Dylan was my romantic safety net.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.806
How is a person supposed
to live without one?

10:35.947 --> 10:37.197
Alex, I'm asking!

10:37.281 --> 10:38.969
It is scientifically impossible

10:39.056 --> 10:40.744
for me to care less
about your... Ow!

10:40.806 --> 10:41.991
Head down, honey.

10:42.055 --> 10:43.677
- What?!
- Where is your mom?

10:43.720 --> 10:45.775
She's been gone
for over an hour.

10:45.842 --> 10:47.231
She's just sitting in the car.

10:47.319 --> 10:48.587
- What?!
- What?!

10:48.690 --> 10:51.400
She's just sitting... never mind!

10:53.768 --> 10:55.131
(sighs)

10:55.220 --> 10:56.627
Oh! Hi.

10:56.736 --> 10:59.111
Hi. How long you been sitting out here?

10:59.272 --> 11:01.814
That's a weird question.
I literally just drove in.

11:01.876 --> 11:02.876
Oh.

11:02.994 --> 11:04.119
- (knocking)
- Aah!

11:04.231 --> 11:05.955
Sorry. We usually try to
get here in under 30 minutes.

11:05.979 --> 11:06.986
Yeah, thank you. Okay.

11:07.046 --> 11:08.314
Thank you.

11:08.648 --> 11:10.306
Oh, God. Phil...

11:10.409 --> 11:11.753
I can't go back in there.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.298
I'm sorry. I tried.

11:13.392 --> 11:15.314
I opened the door, but
my legs wouldn't move.

11:15.421 --> 11:16.736
Honey...

11:21.138 --> 11:22.345
Drive.

11:22.497 --> 11:24.172
What? What about Alex's pills?

11:24.267 --> 11:25.697
(Pills rattle, thud)

11:25.892 --> 11:27.536
- Drive.
- Oh!

11:33.427 --> 11:34.907
So... so we're
running away from home.

11:34.974 --> 11:36.400
I mean, I-I-Is that okay?

11:36.472 --> 11:37.833
Yes. We live with three adults.

11:37.944 --> 11:39.649
We're basically landlords
in an apartment building.

11:39.673 --> 11:41.978
- We're the Ropers!
- Yes! Yes!

11:42.072 --> 11:44.205
We could just drive and drive.

11:44.308 --> 11:47.319
Exactly! We've earned the right
to live the empty-nesters' life

11:47.400 --> 11:49.181
even though we're still full-nesters.

11:49.244 --> 11:51.822
Oh, my God! Do you
remember that bottle of wine

11:51.884 --> 11:53.462
we put aside the night
Haley was born?

11:53.535 --> 11:54.836
Yes! We were gonna open it

11:54.939 --> 11:57.165
- the night all three of them moved out.
- Uh-huh.

11:57.306 --> 11:58.962
And watch one of the
thousands of movies we missed

11:58.986 --> 12:00.866
'cause they were sick or hungry

12:00.931 --> 12:02.837
or choking on the
head of a Power Ranger.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.072
I am a woman who has never
seen "Thelma and Louise."

12:06.141 --> 12:08.306
That's the only Harvey
Keitel movie I've missed!

12:08.441 --> 12:11.251
- Where are we going?
- Let's let the universe decide.

12:13.373 --> 12:17.947
"Family is a gift you
receive every day."

12:19.341 --> 12:21.330
So they're making
sarcastic ones now?

12:21.454 --> 12:23.775
(both laugh)

12:23.855 --> 12:25.683
- Squirrel!
- (tires screech)

12:27.246 --> 12:28.436
Uh-oh.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.613
I think we just ruined
someone's graduation.

12:31.972 --> 12:33.522
- CAMERON: Hey.
- Ay!

12:33.596 --> 12:36.237
- I must have fallen asleep.
- I don't see how.

12:36.285 --> 12:39.754
The fumes coming off of that
potion are something else.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.858
Yes. When we're done with
this, don't throw it out

12:41.936 --> 12:43.045
because with a teaspoon,

12:43.123 --> 12:45.342
- I can clean the swimming pool.
- (cellphone chimes)

12:45.417 --> 12:47.525
Okay, Manny needs to
see me in the garage.

12:47.598 --> 12:49.738
- I will be right back.
- Yeah, but come right back

12:49.794 --> 12:52.623
because this cannot stay
longer than five minutes.

12:52.761 --> 12:55.412
Oh, and just for fun,
what would happen

12:55.506 --> 12:58.678
if it stayed on for,
say, I don't know, 17?

12:58.777 --> 13:00.865
Well, they say that...

13:01.082 --> 13:02.420
Ay, no!

13:02.590 --> 13:03.694
No!

13:03.834 --> 13:07.569
You used Joe's cape
for the smelly thing?

13:07.691 --> 13:09.858
You know how important
this is for him?

13:09.982 --> 13:12.186
- No.
- It goes me, the cape,

13:12.286 --> 13:13.647
chocolate chip cookies,

13:13.735 --> 13:14.850
and then Jay!

13:14.945 --> 13:16.341
Well, can't we just say
Jay ruined it,

13:16.365 --> 13:18.319
since he's already so far
down the list?

13:18.473 --> 13:20.279
Has anyone seen my cape?

13:20.387 --> 13:22.032
Uh, no. What's it look like?

13:22.160 --> 13:23.787
Like a cape!

13:23.996 --> 13:27.139
Sorry. It's just so stressful.

13:27.303 --> 13:29.394
- (cellphone chimes)
- You know what? I have to go to Manny.

13:29.418 --> 13:31.287
Then I'll clean Joe's
cape. Then I'll be back.

13:31.331 --> 13:32.398
It's okay. Go.

13:32.454 --> 13:35.490
We will all be waiting
for you here in Cancún.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.647
(cellphone chimes)

13:40.381 --> 13:42.069
Something's wrong.
There's oil everywhere!

13:42.162 --> 13:44.803
Well, you probably just need
to tighten the drain plug.

13:44.904 --> 13:46.076
- (gasps)
- Oh!

13:46.154 --> 13:47.358
(air hissing)

13:47.442 --> 13:48.936
You popped her tire?!

13:48.999 --> 13:50.869
It's okay. It's all right.

13:51.068 --> 13:52.629
Where does Jay keep his patch kit?

13:52.716 --> 13:54.521
It took me 20 minutes
to find the light switch.

13:54.545 --> 13:55.904
I'm gonna know
where a patch kit is?

13:55.928 --> 13:57.959
Don't panic.
I saw one here earlier.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.326
Oh, oh!

13:59.816 --> 14:01.060
Here it is.

14:01.162 --> 14:02.561
- Oh, no! No!
- What?

14:02.683 --> 14:03.984
That's Joe's cape!

14:04.119 --> 14:05.428
(gasps) Oh, no!

14:05.529 --> 14:07.264
Joe loves this cape
more than anything.

14:07.319 --> 14:08.639
It goes me, the cape,

14:08.764 --> 14:10.177
- chocolate chip cookies...
- Almost done, Manny?

14:10.201 --> 14:11.217
Oh, hey.

14:11.253 --> 14:13.342
Yeah, well, he would
be if I wasn't out here

14:13.397 --> 14:15.248
asking him so many
questions about, you know,

14:15.330 --> 14:17.186
how to... how to patch a tire, but...

14:17.233 --> 14:19.276
like he said, the directions
are written clearly down

14:19.300 --> 14:20.248
inside the patch kit.

14:20.295 --> 14:21.803
And then if you get in a real jam,

14:21.903 --> 14:23.819
there's tons of videos online, anyway.

14:23.857 --> 14:25.034
Shouldn't we give him
some space?

14:25.058 --> 14:26.325
Maybe get some... some tea?

14:26.420 --> 14:27.537
Oh!

14:29.177 --> 14:31.670
So, do you have a
date for spring formal?

14:31.776 --> 14:34.483
I probably won't even go.
I have nothing to wear.

14:35.997 --> 14:37.831
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

14:37.919 --> 14:39.248
It's not that big of a deal.

14:39.354 --> 14:41.388
I mean, people are starving.

14:41.659 --> 14:43.123
Oh.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.627
This isn't a sign, is it?

14:49.691 --> 14:51.919
Well, it's not a sturdy one,
but they're only fifth-graders.

14:51.943 --> 14:53.710
No! No, that we shouldn't have run away!

14:53.773 --> 14:56.182
No. We're just gonna tie
this off, hit the open road,

14:56.270 --> 14:57.830
and keep driving until
the toilets flush

14:57.868 --> 14:58.901
in the other direction.

14:58.908 --> 15:00.807
Oh, God! Oh, no!
It's floating away!

15:00.904 --> 15:02.198
Oh! Oh, okay!

15:02.239 --> 15:03.455
It's caught in the
tree. We can reach it.

15:03.479 --> 15:04.877
- Get on my shoulders!
- What?

15:04.971 --> 15:06.729
Right! Oh, yeah, right. Oh!

15:06.806 --> 15:08.690
Okay, I forgot about
that. Oh, wait. Go forward!

15:08.786 --> 15:09.869
It's too high!

15:09.940 --> 15:12.197
Just reach for the string! Are
you reaching for the string?

15:12.221 --> 15:14.377
No, I'm pretending I'm
at a Def Leppard concert!

15:14.456 --> 15:15.934
It's right there! Just grab it!

15:15.981 --> 15:17.346
I can't reach it, Phil!

15:17.416 --> 15:19.411
I can't reach "The Next Chapter!"

15:19.538 --> 15:21.166
Oh, my God. Let me down.
Let me down.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.243
- What?
- Let me down.

15:22.268 --> 15:23.479
What?

15:23.603 --> 15:25.908
Don't you see what the
universe is trying to tell us?

15:26.063 --> 15:28.276
We are never gonna
reach the next chapter.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.966
Luke's not going to college.

15:30.049 --> 15:31.713
Haley's gonna grow old
in the basement.

15:31.854 --> 15:34.590
Alex is just gonna keep
coming back to taunt us

15:34.682 --> 15:36.048
and use up our tissues!

15:36.158 --> 15:38.197
I don't think the universe
cares that much about us.

15:38.221 --> 15:40.243
Phil, we tried to run away,

15:40.338 --> 15:42.345
and I can still see
our chimney from here.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.807
It's over.

15:43.914 --> 15:45.205
Oh, yeah.

15:45.299 --> 15:46.736
This is it.

15:46.932 --> 15:48.541
"Welcome...

15:48.932 --> 15:50.520
"to our life!"

15:50.986 --> 15:52.756
- Ha!
- Sweetheart,

15:53.002 --> 15:54.682
I-I am as upset as you are,

15:54.726 --> 15:58.072
but since when did anything
work out the way we planned?

15:58.411 --> 15:59.973
We didn't plan on having Haley.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.807
We didn't plan on having Alex.

16:01.918 --> 16:03.127
We did plan on having Luke,

16:03.200 --> 16:05.072
but we didn't plan on having <i>Luke.</i>

16:05.570 --> 16:08.705
I'm having a tantrum.
And I love our kids, I do.

16:08.776 --> 16:10.018
Most of the time, I do.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.518
It's just I had this...

16:11.611 --> 16:14.588
this picture of how our
life would look right now.

16:15.644 --> 16:16.711
(sighs)

16:16.892 --> 16:18.822
- This is not that.
- No.

16:19.030 --> 16:20.268
Yeah.

16:20.438 --> 16:21.538
I get it.

16:21.602 --> 16:22.622
(sighs)

16:22.647 --> 16:24.174
Maybe...

16:24.466 --> 16:26.952
maybe we don't have
throw away the picture.

16:27.401 --> 16:30.072
Just refocus it a little.

16:31.026 --> 16:33.180
(both chuckle)

16:39.377 --> 16:40.752
Lug nut. Tire iron.

16:40.804 --> 16:42.123
Flugel hammer. Pigeon door.

16:42.171 --> 16:44.508
These are all nonsense words to me.
I don't know what I'm doing here.

16:44.532 --> 16:46.610
Yeah, well, I don't know
what I'm doing here, either.

16:46.634 --> 16:48.838
Am I so incapable of
spending a night alone

16:48.916 --> 16:52.026
(straining) that I had to come
over here and create all this drama?

16:52.165 --> 16:53.965
No wonder Mitchell wanted
to get away from me.

16:54.002 --> 16:55.635
- (door opens)
- Hello?

16:55.719 --> 16:57.390
Oh! Hey, well, thank you, Manny,

16:57.478 --> 16:59.924
for letting me tighten
that last wheel screw.

17:00.091 --> 17:02.526
Maybe next week you could
teach me how to street punch?

17:02.657 --> 17:04.471
Yeah. Sure!

17:04.551 --> 17:05.858
Wow.

17:05.944 --> 17:07.854
Cam found it upstairs for me.

17:08.079 --> 17:10.104
It's one of your mom's
dresses. Isn't that crazy?

17:10.173 --> 17:12.096
I can see running it by a therapist.

17:12.242 --> 17:14.358
So, car looks done.

17:14.439 --> 17:15.819
Do you maybe want to,

17:15.859 --> 17:17.486
I don't know, go get something to eat?

17:17.569 --> 17:20.229
Uh, sure! But I'm a little dirty.

17:20.366 --> 17:22.032
So? It's cute.

17:24.830 --> 17:26.252
(chuckles)

17:28.432 --> 17:30.100
A word?

17:32.110 --> 17:33.416
See?

17:33.922 --> 17:35.281
Good as...

17:35.384 --> 17:36.806
No!

17:36.957 --> 17:39.659
- Oh.
- It looks like a monster ate it!

17:39.824 --> 17:41.127
Exactly.

17:41.206 --> 17:43.207
See? It tells a story.

17:43.393 --> 17:46.736
This burn is from when
you fought a dragon!

17:46.854 --> 17:48.197
A-And these oil stains?

17:48.266 --> 17:49.853
Well, they're from when
you saved that 18-wheeler

17:49.877 --> 17:51.424
from going off a bridge.

17:51.523 --> 17:55.291
This is the cape of a superhero

17:55.432 --> 17:58.604
who's always there for people in need.

17:58.885 --> 18:00.424
Wow!

18:00.635 --> 18:01.868
Fly away!

18:01.948 --> 18:03.783
That was so nice, Cam.

18:03.979 --> 18:06.080
Oh, thanks. You look better.

18:06.143 --> 18:07.658
And your fever's gone.

18:07.736 --> 18:10.244
I don't know what you put
in my <i>abuela's</i> potion,

18:10.346 --> 18:13.479
but it took care of the
fever faster than ever.

18:13.705 --> 18:16.695
Look! It even made my
teeth whiter, huh?

18:16.986 --> 18:17.986
Oh! Wow. Look at that.

18:18.057 --> 18:21.369
Here I was beating myself up
because I couldn't be alone, and...

18:21.714 --> 18:23.610
one could argue that
everybody in this house

18:23.721 --> 18:25.674
is a little better off
because of it.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.760
Well, I lost a dress and
the house smells like smoke,

18:28.862 --> 18:32.395
so I wouldn't be
high-fiving myself that much.

18:49.235 --> 18:50.735
Ah, yes, sir?

18:52.674 --> 18:53.916
Right?

18:53.955 --> 18:54.963
(scoffs)

18:55.026 --> 18:57.065
Nobody keeps me on edge
for 500 pages

18:57.165 --> 18:58.932
then decides they're just
done writing.

18:59.004 --> 19:01.627
Either end the damn story
or don't even write it!

19:01.721 --> 19:02.830
Yes, exactly.

19:02.912 --> 19:04.692
God, for a minute, I
thought I missed something.

19:04.716 --> 19:05.816
You did.

19:05.904 --> 19:08.799
The chance to read a great
book on your one night alone.

19:09.408 --> 19:11.111
Well, at least the
steak was good, right?

19:11.210 --> 19:13.463
Nice cut. Perfectly cooked.

19:13.545 --> 19:14.549
Terrific wine.

19:14.618 --> 19:15.618
(laughs)

19:15.688 --> 19:16.979
What? What's... what's funny?

19:17.089 --> 19:18.332
You.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.588
The steak, the book,
hell, this whole trip.

19:20.725 --> 19:22.111
You're turning into me!

19:22.274 --> 19:24.141
No. No. Unh-unh.

19:24.229 --> 19:25.979
No, no, no. Dad. No, no.

19:26.057 --> 19:27.190
Hey. You're turning into me.

19:27.268 --> 19:28.276
How?

19:28.353 --> 19:30.178
The fact that you stayed
with that book at all,

19:30.202 --> 19:32.557
which is basically a love
story between two men.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.547
- It's a buddy thing!
- Oh, please!

19:34.636 --> 19:36.336
Buddies don't find
that many opportunities

19:36.408 --> 19:37.946
to skinny-dip together.

19:38.103 --> 19:39.524
Every time they saw
a body of water,

19:39.571 --> 19:41.349
it was off with the pants, splash!

19:41.414 --> 19:42.563
Come on.
You're just making it worse.

19:42.587 --> 19:44.429
Oh, my God! Your hands!

19:44.594 --> 19:45.945
That's what your spa
appointment was.

19:45.969 --> 19:46.985
You got a manicure.

19:47.017 --> 19:49.454
It's because Gloria said
that my hands were too rough.

19:49.532 --> 19:50.743
It was <i>her</i> idea.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.438
Considerate... that's me.

19:52.507 --> 19:54.040
Running from your family...

19:54.108 --> 19:55.505
that's me.

19:58.944 --> 20:00.563
Yeah, yeah.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.524
Ah, I guess it's possible

20:03.568 --> 20:05.837
that we both moved...

20:06.365 --> 20:07.950
to the center a little.

20:08.030 --> 20:10.055
Yeah, well, it makes sense.

20:10.249 --> 20:12.613
It definitely makes
things easier between us.

20:12.751 --> 20:14.321
A little less distance.

20:14.385 --> 20:15.518
Yeah.

20:15.566 --> 20:16.626
Yeah.

20:16.671 --> 20:19.399
Uh, hey, um... here's
a... it's a crazy thought.

20:19.514 --> 20:21.837
There's... there's something
old us could never do

20:21.907 --> 20:24.243
without tears and screaming

20:24.301 --> 20:27.430
that I think new us
might be able to handle.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.126
It might help me out at home,

20:29.210 --> 20:30.977
you know, if... if you're game.

20:32.126 --> 20:34.212
Lead with your elbow.

20:34.559 --> 20:36.075
Shift your weight.

20:36.504 --> 20:38.001
Follow through.

20:38.891 --> 20:40.916
- That's not bad.
- No, it wasn't good, but I'm not crying

20:40.940 --> 20:43.100
and you haven't called me
"missy", so let's keep going.

20:43.253 --> 20:46.704
♪♪

20:46.728 --> 20:50.141
♪♪

20:50.259 --> 20:53.633
♪♪

20:54.065 --> 20:55.723
(voice breaking) They had no choice.

20:55.926 --> 20:58.712

21:02.800 --> 21:05.321
The light turns red when
you put something on it,

21:05.521 --> 21:07.219
green when the hook is free.

21:07.316 --> 21:09.837
- I call it a Smart Hook.
- So smart.

21:09.862 --> 21:10.884
I got the idea...

21:10.909 --> 21:12.123
- when I was in a parking garage.
- Uh-huh.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.696
- You know those little lights...
- Oh, God, Dad. No, don't look.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.258
- Don't look.
- What are they doing here?

21:15.282 --> 21:16.727
They're not gonna want to
have brunch with us, are they?

21:16.751 --> 21:18.977
They can't! This is our day!

21:19.165 --> 21:21.696
- You think they see us?
- Hmm.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.014
Just keep walking.

21:23.087 --> 21:24.157
No sudden movements.

21:24.229 --> 21:27.407
The site maps say
there's another café...

21:27.479 --> 21:29.117
- My book.
- Leave it!
