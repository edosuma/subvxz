00:52.680 --> 00:55.365
One way to make sure
your food isn't being poisoned

and I'm in there
and you're out here.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.567

before the apocalypse.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.246
But what about since then?

16:55.400 --> 16:58.165
At least your wife and daughter,
they died quickly.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.887

what this world became.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.290

- Then what was it?

17:16.079 --> 17:18.810
(CHUCKLES) The good doctor here
is building me an army.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.319
- What?!
- Yeah.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.847
So I guess this means
you're not going to California.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.844
Maybe. Maybe not.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.447

it'll be with an army.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.971

Cassandra so well.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.809
OK.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.647
Look on the bright side.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.086
You didn't get injected.

18:04.240 --> 18:08.165

- Yeah.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.486

18:51.640 --> 18:53.961

to make a fake vaccine

18:54.120 --> 18:58.648
that turns people into
zombie blends that he controls.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.531

That's the dark side
of ambition.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.090
So all those Zeros,
he controls them?

19:12.240 --> 19:14.481
- Yep.
- So no California?

19:14.640 --> 19:17.246
No. We're still going
to California, all of us.

Absolutely, even if we gotta
take Murphy by force again.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.929
What about
the zombie slave army?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.970
Yeah, well, seems like
there's an incubation period

19:27.120 --> 19:28.929
before he has total control.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.730
We gotta get out of here
before then.

- Gotta get him too.

He damn near got us killed.

get the better of him,

for any of us.

started for me.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.643
I was 12 years old.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.723
My brother Julio was 10.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.089
And he was shot dead
in a drive-by

hands without seeing his blood.

gave you a reason to kill?

something, brother.
