WEBVTT

00:08.869 --> 00:11.167
Oh, my God.
Please.

00:11.184 --> 00:14.074
Oh no, God. Please

00:32.427 --> 00:34.234
Go! Go!

00:51.600 --> 00:54.122
Miami-Dade PD. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:00.450 --> 01:03.166
The killer...
he's still inside.

01:16.290 --> 01:17.998
She's already gone, Frank.

01:19.887 --> 01:20.752
Yeah.

01:21.350 --> 01:22.424
So the killer.

01:23.945 --> 01:24.854
House is clear.

01:34.456 --> 01:36.540
Body's still warm.

01:36.553 --> 01:38.245
She hasn't been dead long.

01:44.881 --> 01:46.495
Look at this, Horatio.

01:47.155 --> 01:49.046
It's a little coffin.

01:50.259 --> 01:51.741
Think the killer left it?

01:51.756 --> 01:52.972
Could be.

01:54.635 --> 01:56.431
Maybe it's a message.

01:56.888 --> 01:59.143
Someone trying to scare us
off the case.

01:59.156 --> 02:00.422
Maybe...

02:00.698 --> 02:03.430
but we don't scare that easy,
do we, Alexx?

02:54.407 --> 02:56.513
Alissa was
my best friend.

02:56.616 --> 02:58.140
I was just trying
to help her.

02:58.157 --> 02:59.540
By stealing
a car?

02:59.677 --> 03:01.113
No, I wasn't
stealing it.

03:01.115 --> 03:01.953
You don't understand.

03:01.956 --> 03:03.283
I was saving my life.

03:04.457 --> 03:06.082
Look, my car is in the shop.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.552
The navigation system is busted.

03:07.558 --> 03:08.740
I swear.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.103
You can call my mechanic.

03:10.108 --> 03:13.360
All due respect, Ms Madison,
but you're covered in blood.

03:15.855 --> 03:17.420
When I got
to Alissa's condo,

03:17.436 --> 03:18.392
the door was open

03:18.398 --> 03:20.413
and she was lying
on the floor in blood.

03:20.418 --> 03:22.303
I thought that she might
still be alive.

03:23.666 --> 03:25.243
Alissa? You here?

03:27.027 --> 03:28.601
Oh, my God.

03:28.947 --> 03:29.922
Alissa.

03:30.395 --> 03:32.412
Then I heard this noise
and I freaked out

03:32.418 --> 03:34.453
and I got out of there
as quickly as I could.

03:34.755 --> 03:35.540
Okay.

03:35.555 --> 03:37.530
Mr Wolfe,
full process on the clothes

03:37.535 --> 03:38.243
and the car.

03:38.256 --> 03:41.100
Ms Madison, you're going to go
with this officer, please.

03:44.056 --> 03:44.940
Hmm.

03:44.956 --> 03:47.470
Detective Lloyd, Auto Theft Detail.
I'm Ryan Wolfe.

03:47.476 --> 03:50.500
So, uh, what happened with
the car that our suspect stole?

03:50.505 --> 03:52.441
Her bad luck
was a bait car.

03:52.755 --> 03:54.102
Bait car?
What's that?

03:54.126 --> 03:55.603
Every morning, we leave
these cars keyed up

03:55.608 --> 03:56.971
in crime-prone locations,

03:56.975 --> 03:59.180
control them remotely
to catch car thieves.

03:59.365 --> 04:01.753
So how do you know when one
of these cars is stolen?

04:02.025 --> 04:03.481
When a thief turns
the ignition,

04:03.486 --> 04:05.003
it activates a
surveillance camera

04:05.008 --> 04:06.442
along with a
wireless signal.

04:06.765 --> 04:07.763
<i>Computers are programmed</i>

04:07.777 --> 04:10.911
<i>to remotely shut off the engine
and lock all the doors.</i>

04:12.035 --> 04:13.693
<i>That signal gets sent
to our computers</i>

04:13.705 --> 04:15.492
<i>along with the car's location.</i>

04:16.055 --> 04:18.932
<i>We're there in minutes,
sometimes seconds.</i>

04:19.298 --> 04:20.940
Okay. I'm going to need
to take that car

04:20.957 --> 04:22.101
to our garage.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.181
I can't say for sure, Eric,

04:26.708 --> 04:28.953
but it looks
like blunt force trauma.

04:30.386 --> 04:32.561
Golf club
as a murder weapon?

04:32.868 --> 04:34.212
Wouldn't be the first time.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.543
Alissa's got skin
under her nails.

04:37.555 --> 04:39.560
Probably the killer's.

04:39.585 --> 04:41.431
I'll get this to DNA.

04:41.855 --> 04:43.363
Thanks, Alexx.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.840
Well, Eric, what
do we got so far?

04:51.855 --> 04:56.400
Ryan, we have
a golf club, coffin...

04:56.658 --> 04:58.353
.. and signs of a struggle.

05:02.158 --> 05:03.343
Wait a second.

05:07.156 --> 05:09.631
Oh, God, that's
an actual goat head.

05:13.958 --> 05:16.031
Oh, this is Santeria.

05:16.856 --> 05:18.782
Look, I'll do all the
sketchings and photographs,

05:18.788 --> 05:20.030
but I'm not
touching anything.

05:20.308 --> 05:21.313
Why?

05:21.338 --> 05:22.641
Because I'm Catholic.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.341
What does being Catholic
have to do with it?

05:25.358 --> 05:28.641
Santeria is a mix of African
voodoo and Catholicism.

05:28.658 --> 05:32.101
Its purpose is to invoke the spirits.
With a goat's head?

05:32.155 --> 05:35.400
They use animal sacrifice
to ask for blessings and curses.

05:35.416 --> 05:36.741
So let me get
this straight.

05:36.756 --> 05:39.052
You're scared of being
cursed and that's why

05:39.058 --> 05:41.463
you're not gonna collect the
little coffin over there?

05:42.056 --> 05:42.842
Yeah.

05:42.855 --> 05:44.163
It's not out of fear, though.

05:44.188 --> 05:45.261
It's out of respect.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.841
These are holy offerings.

05:46.858 --> 05:48.240
It's sacrilege to
mess with them.

05:48.258 --> 05:52.061
Oh. Well, uh,
this is evidence.

05:52.755 --> 05:54.391
That's why you're here.

05:56.308 --> 05:57.580
Okay, fine.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.290
I'm not scared.

06:06.758 --> 06:08.001
Get anything?

06:08.458 --> 06:10.983
There's a lot of victim's
blood, but nothing conclusive.

06:10.988 --> 06:13.242
I guess the only thing
we know right now for sure

06:13.258 --> 06:15.222
is the victim
was a golfer.

06:15.358 --> 06:18.083
Hmm. I beg to differ.
You do?

06:18.256 --> 06:20.192
This club is
as long as mine.

06:20.287 --> 06:22.090
It's got to be
over 43 inches.

06:22.105 --> 06:22.850
What does that mean?

06:22.858 --> 06:24.351
Tall people
buy tall clubs.

06:24.386 --> 06:26.390
Whoever used this
was at least six feet.

06:26.408 --> 06:28.652
Our victim was just over five.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.341
These weren't her clubs.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.453
Alissa was the only one living
at the condo, though.

06:32.457 --> 06:33.791
I wonder
who they could belong to.

06:33.806 --> 06:35.373
Well, let's see.

06:36.708 --> 06:38.013
He's a lefty.

06:38.907 --> 06:40.800
Judging by the
rigidity of this club,

06:40.808 --> 06:43.681
he's very strong
or he's a very serious golfer.

06:44.108 --> 06:45.941
That's a good observation.
See?

06:45.957 --> 06:48.081
You don't have to use a mass
spec to figure out everything.

06:48.155 --> 06:49.553
What about the other men
in her life?

06:49.555 --> 06:51.592
What do you know?
Boyfriends, brother, anybody?

06:51.606 --> 06:52.941
How about an ex-husband?

06:52.957 --> 06:55.241
A neighbor said she was
in the middle of a divorce.

06:57.055 --> 06:58.140
You, uh...

06:58.155 --> 06:59.431
you play golf, Trevor?

06:59.455 --> 07:00.741
Yeah.

07:00.758 --> 07:01.931
Is that illegal?

07:02.057 --> 07:02.833
No, but killing

07:02.838 --> 07:04.433
your ex-wife is, Trevor.

07:04.906 --> 07:05.691
What?

07:05.706 --> 07:07.843
When? It's been weeks
since I've spoken to Alissa.

07:07.855 --> 07:08.993
Really?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.782
Because she was beaten
with your five wood

07:10.785 --> 07:12.441
this morning.
Oh, God.

07:13.515 --> 07:14.951
I haven't seen those clubs

07:14.957 --> 07:16.641
in as long as I
haven't seen her.

07:16.655 --> 07:18.562
So your concern is the clubs?

07:18.707 --> 07:21.152
$10,000 custom-made.

07:21.256 --> 07:22.842
She was hoarding them.

07:23.045 --> 07:26.180
If I'd have been there, I
wouldn't have left without them.

07:26.458 --> 07:27.900
What about Santeria?

07:27.918 --> 07:28.900
Was Alissa into that?

07:29.016 --> 07:32.362
Ugh. Yoga, Krav Maga.

07:32.386 --> 07:33.802
Alissa's always into something.

07:34.447 --> 07:36.043
Could have been
her latest phase.

07:36.138 --> 07:38.260
Am I at least going
to get my clubs back?

07:38.853 --> 07:41.635
I would say
that would be unlikely.

08:36.010 --> 08:39.554
The body under
this sheet sat up?

08:40.465 --> 08:41.666
This isn't the guy.

08:41.669 --> 08:43.881
The guy I saw was blond.

08:44.006 --> 08:47.391
I know it sounds crazy,
but this happened.

08:47.408 --> 08:50.441
Ryan, this body
is 100% dead.

08:50.457 --> 08:51.840
Crushed torso.

08:51.856 --> 08:54.043
Any movement
would be impossible.

08:54.058 --> 08:55.530
That's not the guy.

08:56.556 --> 08:58.461
There's got to be
an explanation for all this.

08:58.466 --> 08:59.931
Right?
There is.

08:59.956 --> 09:00.902
You.

09:01.255 --> 09:03.482
The Santeria stuff
has got you spooked.

09:03.497 --> 09:05.243
I don't know, I don't know.
Look.

09:05.256 --> 09:07.142
When I first started
working in the morgue,

09:07.155 --> 09:09.701
my mind played
tricks on me, too.

09:09.856 --> 09:11.842
I mean, you're sure
he didn't move?

09:12.456 --> 09:14.742
Why don't you go on
back over to CSI

09:14.757 --> 09:16.561
and take a little
break, okay?

09:18.857 --> 09:19.521
Okay.

09:30.255 --> 09:32.113
Must be your lucky day.

09:32.456 --> 09:33.680
I got a hit on the epis

09:33.685 --> 09:35.110
from the vic's fingernails.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.501
Alissa put up a fight,
got us plenty of DNA,

09:38.516 --> 09:39.600
and it belongs to...

09:39.618 --> 09:40.950
Ed Smith.

09:42.767 --> 09:46.681
Armed robbery of Alan Solner's
gold exchange six months ago.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.422
Held a gun
to the guy's head.

09:48.558 --> 09:50.593
Got away with four mil
in bars.

09:50.605 --> 09:52.083
Never recovered.

09:52.097 --> 09:54.791
Hmm, and look,
his trial starts tomorrow.

09:54.807 --> 09:56.371
Guess he wanted to
commit one more crime

09:56.375 --> 09:57.880
before he went to prison.

09:58.005 --> 09:59.500
Let me see this guy.

10:02.957 --> 10:04.353
That's the guy.

10:04.745 --> 10:05.640
What guy?

10:05.657 --> 10:07.233
That's the guy in the morgue.

10:09.627 --> 10:10.703
You mean he's dead?

10:10.707 --> 10:11.981
Yeah, I'm not crazy.

10:11.987 --> 10:12.950
I don't know
about that.

10:12.965 --> 10:14.631
You're saying our victim
was killed by a ghost.

10:14.646 --> 10:15.991
No, I'm just saying
there's something weird

10:15.995 --> 10:17.913
going on in the morgue.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.721
Ed Smith used to be
right here.

10:25.048 --> 10:27.662
Well, I still don't
understand how my body

10:27.668 --> 10:29.252
put another body here

10:29.506 --> 10:31.302
and walked out of the morgue.

10:31.305 --> 10:32.573
Well...

10:33.405 --> 10:35.392
I'm about to find out.

10:40.555 --> 10:42.032
You gonna pick that up?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.832
I can't feel my hands.

10:44.655 --> 10:46.602
You messin' with me?

10:47.358 --> 10:49.390
No, they're completely numb.

10:49.465 --> 10:51.053
Is there something on them?

10:55.585 --> 10:57.891
Okay, don't worry.

10:58.307 --> 10:59.841
I can fix this.

10:59.855 --> 11:02.642
It's the curse.
Oh, my God, Alexx.

11:02.658 --> 11:04.412
I think it's the curse.

11:06.955 --> 11:09.792
I told Ryan that that
coffin was bad news.

11:09.805 --> 11:11.793
Was it the coffin that
made his hands numb?

11:11.807 --> 11:14.502
Actually, no. It was
tetrodotoxin powder

11:14.507 --> 11:16.543
from when he
touched the gurney.

11:17.355 --> 11:18.842
That's blowfish poison.

11:18.858 --> 11:20.942
What is Ed Smith
doing with blowfish poison?

11:20.955 --> 11:23.131
Ed Smith tried to
pull one over on us.

11:23.357 --> 11:25.100
Are you saying
he faked his own death?

11:25.208 --> 11:25.843
Yeah.

11:26.446 --> 11:27.121
How?

11:27.177 --> 11:29.632
When tetrodotoxin is
applied to the skin,

11:29.655 --> 11:30.962
it's absorbed into the body

11:30.965 --> 11:33.142
and carried by the blood
to all the major organs.

11:33.155 --> 11:35.143
The toxin slows down
your breathing,

11:35.158 --> 11:36.570
reduces your
heart rate,

11:36.598 --> 11:39.251
and induces a state
of temporary paralysis,

11:39.766 --> 11:40.831
mimicking death

11:40.958 --> 11:42.632
for a period of
hours, even days.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.643
The right dose, and you
wake up a few hours later,

11:45.657 --> 11:46.891
the wrong dose,

11:46.898 --> 11:48.342
and you're
dead for real.

11:48.355 --> 11:49.790
He faked his own death

11:49.805 --> 11:51.743
to get out of
an armed robbery charge?

11:51.755 --> 11:52.732
That is crazy.

11:52.736 --> 11:55.042
Guess what religion's been
known to use the powder.

11:55.057 --> 11:56.160
Santeria?

11:56.306 --> 11:56.693
Yeah.

11:56.706 --> 11:59.713
So I guess that means
you are headed to Calle Ocho.

12:15.156 --> 12:16.543
You mean, zombie powder?

12:16.555 --> 12:17.432
Yeah.

12:18.118 --> 12:19.442
That's illegal,

12:19.456 --> 12:22.042
and you can only get it
if you have a prescription

12:22.055 --> 12:24.133
Oh, now, Clarisa,
come on.

12:24.306 --> 12:25.890
You and I both know
that sometimes

12:25.898 --> 12:27.451
there's a very big
difference between

12:27.458 --> 12:29.191
what's legal and
what's sold here.

12:29.406 --> 12:31.503
It's regulated
by the government, okay?

12:31.506 --> 12:32.803
None of the other Botanicas

12:32.808 --> 12:34.413
can even get
a hold of it.

12:34.857 --> 12:36.203
All right.

12:36.705 --> 12:38.891
What about these two?
Have you seen them?

12:41.466 --> 12:43.181
Him I don't know, but...

12:43.207 --> 12:45.141
yeah, I seen her.

12:45.157 --> 12:47.892
She came in the other day
with her boyfriend.

12:48.007 --> 12:49.440
And he bought some stuff.

12:49.458 --> 12:52.843
Don't remember much about him,
but he's big into Santeria.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.143
He use a credit card?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.890
No, he paid with a check.

12:58.606 --> 12:59.140
All right.

12:59.157 --> 13:00.643
Well, I need you to write down
everything you remember

13:00.645 --> 13:02.102
about the
transaction...

13:02.306 --> 13:05.483
the boyfriend's name or
anything that would be helpful.

13:06.806 --> 13:08.473
Jeremy, tell us
why you bought

13:08.478 --> 13:10.433
blowfish poison
at the Botanica.

13:10.607 --> 13:12.282
Blowfish poison?

13:12.507 --> 13:14.363
That's way out of my realm.

13:14.805 --> 13:16.741
What about the Santeria
curses we found

13:16.756 --> 13:18.852
at your girlfriend
Alissa's condo.

13:19.255 --> 13:21.441
Those are mine, but
they're not curses.

13:21.455 --> 13:23.572
They're symbols of
love and divination.

13:23.608 --> 13:26.932
If they were curses, you'd
have found much more blood.

13:27.555 --> 13:28.632
And the goat's head?

13:28.656 --> 13:32.443
The goat was a
prosperity sacrifice.

13:32.455 --> 13:35.340
I just didn't have a chance
to dispose of the remains.

13:35.355 --> 13:38.403
What kind of sacrifice
was Alissa?

13:40.056 --> 13:43.350
My religion doesn't
make me a murderer.

13:43.606 --> 13:45.383
Well, what about
the little coffin

13:45.388 --> 13:47.122
we found next to Alissa?

13:52.446 --> 13:53.502
There were prints on it

13:53.506 --> 13:55.273
that I bet we could
match to you.

13:56.458 --> 13:59.751
I never put that
anywhere near her.

14:04.058 --> 14:05.742
Where is that now?

14:05.757 --> 14:07.161
It's in our lab.

14:08.357 --> 14:09.443
You need to burn that thing.

14:09.456 --> 14:10.841
Why is that?

14:11.265 --> 14:12.162
'Cause if you don't

14:12.166 --> 14:15.151
get rid of it,
someone else is going to die.

14:25.295 --> 14:27.043
Starting to believe me now?

14:27.056 --> 14:28.800
About the coffin and the curse?

14:28.955 --> 14:30.363
It's getting harder not to.

14:30.955 --> 14:32.042
But do you really believe

14:32.055 --> 14:33.342
someone's going to die?

14:33.355 --> 14:35.540
I think that the sooner
we solve this case,

14:35.556 --> 14:36.952
the sooner this curse,
or whatever it is,

14:36.957 --> 14:39.021
is gonna disappear.
What I want to know is

14:39.028 --> 14:42.281
how did Ed get up and get out of
here without anyone seeing him?

14:42.557 --> 14:46.091
Hey, my staff isn't trained
to watch the living.

14:46.158 --> 14:48.432
I'm more interested
in how he got in.

14:49.655 --> 14:50.942
Is that his file?

14:50.955 --> 14:51.482
Yeah.

14:51.485 --> 14:53.831
Looks like the paramedics
thought he was a coroner's case,

14:53.838 --> 14:55.192
so they brought
him to the morgue

14:55.198 --> 14:57.081
instead of taking
him to funeral home.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.581
A funeral home?

14:58.585 --> 14:59.033
Yeah.

14:59.626 --> 15:01.213
Who signed
his death certificate?

15:03.355 --> 15:06.133
Doctor Trevor Valone.

15:06.957 --> 15:09.163
That's Alissa's ex-husband.

15:09.907 --> 15:11.350
I think we just found
our connection.

15:11.457 --> 15:13.541
Ed was my patient
for many years.

15:13.558 --> 15:14.632
He had a heart condition.

15:14.636 --> 15:16.130
You signed
his death certificate.

15:16.147 --> 15:18.101
You helped him
fake his own death.

15:18.207 --> 15:20.492
Tetrodotoxin can only be
bought by a doctor,

15:20.508 --> 15:24.452
and a search of your office
revealed you bought some.

15:24.636 --> 15:26.362
Look, Ed was my friend.

15:26.457 --> 15:27.740
We played Little
League together,

15:27.757 --> 15:29.540
he was best man
in my wedding.

15:29.558 --> 15:32.640
He just took
a wrong turn somewhere,

15:32.656 --> 15:34.652
ended up stealing
millions in gold,

15:34.756 --> 15:36.380
and I couldn't bear
to see him go to prison

15:36.388 --> 15:37.612
for the rest of his life.

15:37.757 --> 15:39.030
You sure you want to do this?

15:39.037 --> 15:40.833
It's the only way.

16:02.706 --> 16:05.321
911. What is your emergency?

16:12.256 --> 16:13.590
Patient died on the table.

16:13.605 --> 16:16.033
Time of death, 8:32.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.851
Myocardial infarction.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.740
So you help Ed die,

16:21.756 --> 16:23.341
and in turn, he kills Alissa.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.102
Is that the deal?
There was no deal.

16:25.155 --> 16:26.361
Then why was Ed's DNA found

16:26.367 --> 16:27.883
under your ex-wife's
fingernails?

16:28.107 --> 16:30.271
When Alissa and I
were arguing over assets,

16:30.276 --> 16:31.842
Ed tried to reason with her.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.553
He said it was
a total nightmare.

16:34.907 --> 16:36.213
Aren't you in jail yet?

16:36.356 --> 16:37.141
Trevor sent me.

16:37.158 --> 16:39.143
You're just his lapdog.
Be reasonable.

16:39.158 --> 16:40.132
Reasonable?

16:43.708 --> 16:44.843
When did that happen?

16:44.855 --> 16:45.943
Yesterday.

16:45.955 --> 16:48.841
Ed came to my office right
after he saw Danielle.

16:48.856 --> 16:51.801
Oh, wonderful.
So both you and Ed have alibis.

16:52.205 --> 16:53.743
Look, if I were you,

16:53.756 --> 16:55.943
I would check
Alissa's office computer.

16:56.788 --> 16:57.730
Why's that?

16:58.057 --> 16:59.540
Her work was her life.

16:59.555 --> 17:01.593
It's practically
why we got divorced.

17:01.607 --> 17:03.751
Hmm. Thank you.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.291
Looks like, uh,

17:12.307 --> 17:15.012
Alissa Valone's doing
pretty well for herself, huh?

17:15.474 --> 17:18.643
She was the president of
this advertising agency.

17:18.657 --> 17:20.911
You know, all this bad stuff
started happening

17:21.204 --> 17:22.432
when I touched that coffin.

17:22.445 --> 17:24.942
You don't think that that's
a coincidence, do you?

17:24.958 --> 17:27.839
Alissa was cursed by it,
and now I am.

17:27.855 --> 17:29.121
Don't be silly.

17:29.357 --> 17:31.142
I believe in science.

17:32.057 --> 17:33.730
Yeah, I do, too, I'm just,

17:33.748 --> 17:35.141
I'm just saying,
it's kind of weird.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.593
Not weird. We're just here
to pick up Alissa's computer.

17:37.608 --> 17:38.490
It's right there.

17:38.508 --> 17:40.851
We'll shut it down, bring it
to the lab, and have Cooper

17:40.856 --> 17:42.461
analyze the hard drive.
It's very simple.

17:49.757 --> 17:51.150
Coincidence?

17:51.957 --> 17:53.293
Husband sends you
to check the computer

17:53.306 --> 17:54.910
and the battery blows.

17:55.306 --> 17:56.090
Convenient.

17:56.246 --> 17:57.740
Can we get anything
off of it?

17:57.875 --> 18:00.123
Even though the plastic
components were melted,

18:00.135 --> 18:01.590
the electronic board
and the hard drive

18:01.606 --> 18:03.120
may have some information.

18:03.246 --> 18:04.850
So I Frankensteined

18:04.867 --> 18:07.081
this little contraption together
you see before your eyes.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.851
It's my little monster.

18:09.486 --> 18:11.430
It's kind of fitting for
the case, don't you think?

18:11.456 --> 18:12.742
Yes, it's very cute.

18:12.757 --> 18:14.763
In fact, I can't believe
you put all this together today.

18:14.766 --> 18:16.291
It took me a week
to set up my TiVo.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.052
I just attach this
one last wire,

18:18.055 --> 18:20.800
and then transfer what data's
left on the burnt drive

18:21.107 --> 18:22.520
to a clean one.

18:23.247 --> 18:24.543
So now what?

18:24.657 --> 18:26.601
Well, we see
if it actually works.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.373
" You'll get what
you deserve. "

18:36.455 --> 18:37.902
That's a vicious one.

18:38.207 --> 18:39.910
Can we find out
who sent that?

18:43.257 --> 18:45.093
Danielle Madison.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.800
The girl from the bait car.

18:47.036 --> 18:49.020
Isn't she supposed to be
Alissa's best friend?

18:49.077 --> 18:51.411
Nothing is what it seems today.

18:52.576 --> 18:54.262
You told the officer
this morning

18:54.277 --> 18:55.950
that you and Alissa
are good friends.

18:55.977 --> 18:57.170
That's right.

18:57.925 --> 18:59.213
You know, I just don't think

18:59.216 --> 19:00.792
that close friends
send each other

19:00.797 --> 19:02.330
threatening e-mails.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.840
" I hope you die, bitch. "

19:03.847 --> 19:05.741
Rot in hell for what you did. "

19:06.178 --> 19:07.623
What exactly did she do?

19:07.776 --> 19:10.642
Look, she's my friend
and my boss.

19:11.425 --> 19:14.961
I had been working for weeks
on my marketing portfolio

19:15.025 --> 19:17.072
to get promoted,
and she just

19:17.076 --> 19:21.012
gives the job to some guy, some
random guy from Human Resources.

19:21.275 --> 19:23.860
So you went to her condo
to confront her,

19:23.878 --> 19:25.010
and things got out of control?

19:25.017 --> 19:26.010
No, no.

19:26.016 --> 19:27.363
I know I overreacted

19:27.375 --> 19:29.443
when I yelled at
her in the office.

19:29.825 --> 19:31.151
So I went
to the condo

19:31.155 --> 19:32.353
to apologize.

19:32.428 --> 19:34.143
But when I got there,
the door was open,

19:34.156 --> 19:36.620
and she was just
lying on the floor.

19:36.936 --> 19:39.551
So I never actually
got to tell her.

19:39.875 --> 19:42.642
I just... I really
feel awful about that.

19:42.926 --> 19:44.972
Is there any way
you can prove that?

19:46.077 --> 19:46.611
No.

19:48.425 --> 19:50.592
I know this looks bad for me.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.732
But... I didn't do it.

19:56.025 --> 19:58.331
Time is of the essence,
Officer Lloyd.

19:58.427 --> 20:01.071
I got the tape from the bait car
as soon as I could.

20:01.177 --> 20:04.220
I know you need to see it
to confirm Danielle's alibi.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.912
Those blips are the bait cars.

20:06.925 --> 20:08.561
They move, we move.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.622
Here's from this morning.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.211
So what do we got?

20:13.227 --> 20:15.771
Cameras are only activated
when the motor is started.

20:15.777 --> 20:17.702
What you're looking at
is my officer

20:17.705 --> 20:19.132
who drove it
to the bait location.

20:19.157 --> 20:22.282
Could you, Officer,
speed this up for me, please?

20:28.475 --> 20:29.821
There's your suspect.

20:30.075 --> 20:31.781
There's Danielle.

20:32.477 --> 20:33.241
The car sat for

20:33.245 --> 20:35.012
two full hours
before she drove it off.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.062
Okay, go back to the break
before she entered the car,

20:38.078 --> 20:40.501
and play it
for me slowly.

20:44.426 --> 20:45.812
In between your suspect

20:45.825 --> 20:46.663
and my officer,

20:46.675 --> 20:47.921
the camera shifted.

20:48.326 --> 20:50.231
It looked like
somebody bumped it.

20:50.925 --> 20:51.892
Yes, they did.

20:51.897 --> 20:56.422
And that means that somebody
was in that car before she was.

20:56.775 --> 20:58.903
Ms. Boa Vista, the car.

21:35.806 --> 21:37.551
So what did
we get, ma'am?

21:37.775 --> 21:39.681
Whoever was in that
car before Danielle

21:39.687 --> 21:40.923
didn't see the
lipstick cam,

21:40.928 --> 21:42.293
but they definitely
touched it.

21:45.418 --> 21:48.243
So I've got AFIS
running it right now.

21:52.128 --> 21:53.461
Javier Ravez.

21:53.475 --> 21:55.312
So how did
Auto Theft Detail miss him?

21:55.328 --> 21:57.083
He never started the car.

21:58.078 --> 21:59.330
You're right.

21:59.478 --> 22:02.853
The sensors and cameras
are activated by the ignition.

22:03.176 --> 22:04.300
Okay, well,
why would Ravez

22:04.308 --> 22:05.963
get into the car
and not steal it?

22:05.975 --> 22:07.152
Let's go find out.

22:10.228 --> 22:11.910
I didn't steal that car.

22:11.925 --> 22:15.270
No, you didn't steal it but
you were in it this morning.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.581
I don't think so.

22:17.075 --> 22:17.562
Javier,

22:17.576 --> 22:20.553
we recovered your
fingerprint from the car.

22:21.776 --> 22:23.363
Okay.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.661
I was looking for change
to take the bus home.

22:25.676 --> 22:27.151
Didn't find any, I skipped.

22:27.578 --> 22:29.722
You skipped.

22:32.077 --> 22:33.983
Is that it?

22:34.477 --> 22:35.863
That's it.

22:35.877 --> 22:36.610
Can I go?

22:36.626 --> 22:38.101
Don't go far.

22:43.526 --> 22:45.432
Horatio.
Yeah.

22:45.477 --> 22:46.763
Something up with that kid?

22:46.777 --> 22:49.562
I want to take a look
into his background.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.170
What are we looking for?
We're looking for

22:51.177 --> 22:53.222
the reason he was in that car.

23:03.827 --> 23:05.662
Can I talk to somebody?

23:05.677 --> 23:07.150
Yeah, what about?

23:07.426 --> 23:09.560
It's about my court
case against Ed smith.

23:09.578 --> 23:10.750
You must be the guy he robbed?

23:11.176 --> 23:12.221
Yeah.

23:12.277 --> 23:14.260
Four million of my gold gone,

23:14.277 --> 23:16.213
and today the judge tells me
the thief is asking

23:16.225 --> 23:17.260
for a continuance.

23:17.275 --> 23:18.363
What the hell is going on? Look,

23:18.377 --> 23:21.060
the court case will continue
as soon as it possibly can.

23:21.078 --> 23:22.452
All right.
Well, the rumor is

23:22.877 --> 23:24.650
Ed's dead.

23:25.478 --> 23:28.263
I'm offering a reward
for my stolen property.

23:28.278 --> 23:29.062
One million...

23:29.078 --> 23:31.011
cash for gold,
no questions asked.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.383
That's a mighty generous reward.

23:34.278 --> 23:35.963
Ed Smith isn't dead.

23:35.977 --> 23:37.311
What do you mean?
He died last night.

23:37.327 --> 23:38.930
Uh, that was misreported.

23:39.825 --> 23:41.062
He held a gun to my head,

23:41.075 --> 23:43.520
made me fear for my life and
now he's just walking around?

23:43.978 --> 23:45.063
Well, if you feel
you're in danger,

23:45.076 --> 23:47.483
we can offer you
police protection.

23:48.138 --> 23:50.710
If I wanted protection,
I wouldn't ask you guys.

23:50.728 --> 23:53.173
You can't even keep watch
over a dead body.

23:53.528 --> 23:55.461
We'll find Ed Smith.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.550
Well, you better hope
I don't find him first.

24:06.877 --> 24:08.781
Starting to believe?

24:09.778 --> 24:10.161
Well,

24:10.178 --> 24:12.923
uh, there's
a dead guy walking around

24:12.976 --> 24:14.561
and I suffered
temporary paralysis.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.660
And there was some spontaneous
combustion and all that

24:16.678 --> 24:19.450
since we brought this thing

24:19.776 --> 24:21.961
in here, so I
would have to say,

24:21.975 --> 24:23.560
yeah, Santeria's might have
something to do

24:23.575 --> 24:25.050
with Alissa's death, sure.

24:25.477 --> 24:27.621
Maybe. Maybe not.

24:27.638 --> 24:29.860
I decided to look deeper
into her divorce.

24:29.878 --> 24:32.950
Went to the court to obtain
the Petition for Dissolution.

24:33.275 --> 24:34.971
Oh, yeah, what are
they fighting over?

24:34.977 --> 24:36.362
A condo or car or something?

24:36.377 --> 24:38.551
No, their burial plots.

24:39.726 --> 24:41.861
They already
have burial plots?

24:41.876 --> 24:44.053
It's what happy couples do.

24:44.325 --> 24:45.811
Trevor was desperate for them.

24:45.825 --> 24:47.432
He was willing
to give up the condo,

24:47.776 --> 24:50.461
wedding china, even his
plasma screen television.

24:50.475 --> 24:52.282
But she wasn't budging.

24:52.977 --> 24:56.610
You know an unused burial
plot's a pretty good place to...

24:56.725 --> 24:57.860
hide something.

24:57.876 --> 24:59.820
Yeah, something like gold.

25:02.275 --> 25:03.763
A graveyard.

25:03.775 --> 25:05.253
Yeah, of course.

25:16.027 --> 25:17.163
Hey, Wolfe,

25:17.175 --> 25:18.322
no flashlight
all right.

25:19.078 --> 25:20.061
I know it's dark
but I don't want

25:20.078 --> 25:21.581
to alert anyone
to our presence.

25:21.628 --> 25:23.560
Oh, okay, I won't alert
anyone to our presence here

25:23.575 --> 25:24.811
in the pitch dark...

25:24.837 --> 25:26.151
Did you see that?

25:27.928 --> 25:31.302
Just take it easy,
Wolfe, all right.

25:40.078 --> 25:41.511
Yeah, not a word, Wolfe.

25:41.528 --> 25:42.763
Take it easy, Delko.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.682
Not a word.

25:48.475 --> 25:49.661
The Valones'
burial plot

25:49.676 --> 25:51.351
should be
right up here.

25:53.228 --> 25:55.560
Somebody's here.

25:55.578 --> 25:57.362
Miami-Dade PD.

25:57.377 --> 25:59.480
Identify yourself.

26:05.728 --> 26:07.470
You okay, Wolfe?

26:09.525 --> 26:10.862
I hate this case.

26:10.878 --> 26:12.820
Yeah, tell
me about it.

26:13.478 --> 26:15.653
That's Ed Smith.

26:16.975 --> 26:19.152
Now, he's really dead.

26:19.165 --> 26:21.360
But the gold is gone.

26:21.375 --> 26:22.760
Whoever did this,
they were smart.

26:22.777 --> 26:24.662
They raked the ground
so we can't get any shoeprints.

26:24.678 --> 26:26.422
Shh.
What?

26:26.675 --> 26:28.480
See that red light over there?

26:29.925 --> 26:31.560
Is that a camera?

26:31.575 --> 26:32.780
Looks like
a microphone.

26:32.875 --> 26:35.361
What the hell is going on?

26:35.377 --> 26:37.553
Someone's
recording death.

26:47.226 --> 26:50.070
Relax, I come in peace.

26:50.075 --> 26:52.661
I got nothing off the recorder
so I sent it to Cooper.

26:52.675 --> 26:54.382
All right.

26:55.777 --> 26:57.061
Careful, Eric.

26:57.076 --> 26:58.781
These tables are
glass after all.

26:58.805 --> 27:00.783
Okay, they can take it.

27:01.577 --> 27:03.712
Heard somebody
died twice today. Freaky.

27:03.727 --> 27:05.061
Yeah, well, I know somebody

27:05.075 --> 27:06.182
killed twice today.

27:10.576 --> 27:14.520
There's nothing better
than a wooden handle.

27:17.526 --> 27:19.160
Yeah, the killer
raked the scene,

27:19.175 --> 27:21.880
but he forgot
that his hands got raked, too.

27:26.626 --> 27:28.072
Thank God
they always forget something.

27:50.827 --> 27:51.613
Nothing.

27:51.627 --> 27:52.260
I'll run it against

27:52.276 --> 27:53.821
the reference
samples in this case.

27:57.428 --> 27:59.260
Jeremy Fordham.

27:59.276 --> 28:01.322
Isn't that the vic's boyfriend?

28:02.775 --> 28:04.561
So why am I here again?

28:04.777 --> 28:06.852
You killed Ed Smith, Jeremy.

28:07.427 --> 28:09.360
Yeah, I don't
even know who that is.

28:09.377 --> 28:10.982
Be that as
it may, Jeremy,

28:11.075 --> 28:15.080
you did swing the ax intoji
the man's abdomen, killed him.

28:15.175 --> 28:17.653
And you left evidence
on the handle.

28:23.677 --> 28:25.262
I heard Alissa talk

28:25.276 --> 28:27.853
about her ex and
about the gold.

28:28.075 --> 28:29.362
His what?

28:29.378 --> 28:31.423
Gold. Gold.

28:31.478 --> 28:34.213
He and his buddy, Ed,
from grade school.

28:34.225 --> 28:35.573
Some crazy plan.

28:35.728 --> 28:37.670
Where is it?

28:37.725 --> 28:40.003
If I knew, don't you
think I'd have it.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.723
You mean we'd have it.

28:44.278 --> 28:46.862
And I figured out
it was in her burial plot

28:46.877 --> 28:49.683
from the way her idiot
husband was whining about it.

28:50.127 --> 28:52.063
So you killed her, too?

28:52.078 --> 28:53.783
Why would I?

28:54.175 --> 28:56.561
Hell, I-I didn't want
to kill Ed what's-his-name,

28:56.576 --> 28:57.880
but he got in the way.

29:13.575 --> 29:14.861
Where's the gold now, Jeremy?

29:14.878 --> 29:16.020
It's not at your place.

29:18.975 --> 29:20.362
I won't be telling you.

29:20.377 --> 29:22.653
I guess that goat's head
didn't work after all, huh?

29:23.477 --> 29:25.562
Not much of a prosperity spell.

29:25.577 --> 29:26.663
It will.

29:26.676 --> 29:28.820
That gold will be worth millions
when I get out.

29:29.278 --> 29:31.980
But, Jeremy,
you're not getting out.

29:43.578 --> 29:45.781
Hey, was there anything
on the graveyard recorder?

29:46.375 --> 29:47.762
I contacted the owner.

29:47.777 --> 29:49.580
His name was on
the back of it.

29:49.976 --> 29:51.762
Did he know anything
about the murder?

29:51.775 --> 29:53.783
Murder... no, death... yes.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.360
He was trying

29:55.376 --> 29:57.080
to listen to Greta...

29:57.575 --> 29:58.781
his mother.

29:59.278 --> 30:01.481
What was his mother doing
at the cemetery?

30:01.676 --> 30:03.381
Rotting.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.283
He was trying
to record the dead.

30:08.077 --> 30:09.622
It's called
Electronic Voice Phenomena.

30:09.777 --> 30:12.653
People think the recorders
can pick up the unheard

30:13.076 --> 30:14.860
voices of the dead.

30:14.877 --> 30:17.270
Okay.

30:17.276 --> 30:19.020
I know it sounds hokey.

30:19.877 --> 30:22.622
But listen.

30:22.676 --> 30:24.820
This is a frequency
below human range.

30:25.128 --> 30:29.203
This is the frequency
of the dead.

30:29.677 --> 30:31.262
There right there.

30:31.277 --> 30:32.851
Here, let me isolate
that for you.

30:33.826 --> 30:34.863
Out of the grave...

30:34.877 --> 30:35.563
Has to go...

30:35.578 --> 30:36.761
Kill him.

30:36.775 --> 30:38.753
Go... Ow...

30:41.276 --> 30:43.872
That's not EVP, Cooper.

30:43.878 --> 30:45.763
That's audio parallax.

30:45.778 --> 30:47.851
It also means
that Jeremy wasn't acting alone.

30:48.726 --> 30:50.872
So he had an accomplice.

30:53.077 --> 30:55.523
See, I don't think this place
is so scary in the daytime.

30:55.875 --> 30:58.361
And you?
What? No.

30:58.377 --> 30:59.620
Come on, I
wasn't scared.

30:59.626 --> 31:01.361
You know I listened
to the entire tape,

31:01.375 --> 31:02.653
don't you, Ryan?

31:02.978 --> 31:05.283
So there was an
accomplice here?

31:05.306 --> 31:06.823
Way to change the subject.

31:07.125 --> 31:09.763
There is definitely evidence
of an accomplice, yes.

31:09.775 --> 31:11.513
And that person
took the gold.

31:11.977 --> 31:13.863
So I'm thinking,
our best bet is to look

31:13.875 --> 31:16.151
for something capable
of conducted sound.

31:16.525 --> 31:19.031
Like a mausoleum.
Mm-hmm.

31:31.376 --> 31:33.060
Well, ghosts don't bleed.

31:33.077 --> 31:33.662
Why would the accomplice

31:33.675 --> 31:35.770
be 100 yards
from the grave site?

31:36.028 --> 31:36.071
We should probably

31:36.296 --> 31:36.342
catch our suspect
before he becomes one.

31:49.575 --> 31:53.051
Besides his one, uh, B&E,
Javier's clean, but get this,

31:53.067 --> 31:54.651
he's got a brother
named Carlos.

31:54.676 --> 31:56.061
Continue please.

31:56.077 --> 31:58.583
Carlos picked up his third
strike a couple months ago.

31:58.608 --> 31:59.881
For doing what?

31:59.906 --> 32:01.661
Stealing the exact same bait car

32:01.677 --> 32:03.483
Javier broke into this morning.

32:03.727 --> 32:05.771
Uh, I guess you learned
about it from the trial.

32:05.977 --> 32:08.281
Okay, what were the first
two convictions for?

32:09.177 --> 32:11.200
Meth.
Possession and distribution.

32:11.207 --> 32:12.960
Now, we know there's
a lab out there somewhere,

32:12.977 --> 32:13.961
but he didn't
give up a location.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.651
But maybe Javier knows.

32:20.746 --> 32:23.613
You called. I came.
Cooperation.

32:23.628 --> 32:25.971
And we are deeply
grateful, Javier.

32:26.028 --> 32:26.853
Have a seat.

32:27.077 --> 32:29.133
For you? Okay.

32:31.677 --> 32:32.791
What's up?

32:33.677 --> 32:35.333
We need to swab
your hands.

32:35.577 --> 32:36.943
Too bad I can't help you.

32:36.947 --> 32:38.321
Think again, Javier.

32:45.525 --> 32:46.671
You got to tell
me what that's for,

32:46.675 --> 32:48.683
'cause the law tells me
I got a right to know.

32:48.706 --> 32:51.851
It's really good that you're up
on all the laws you're breaking.

32:52.276 --> 32:54.061
We think you're
into meth production.

32:54.077 --> 32:55.942
Just like your
brother, Javier.

32:55.945 --> 32:57.440
And my skin
tells you that?

32:57.978 --> 32:59.702
We're going to know soon enough.

33:01.007 --> 33:02.752
You think you're so smart.

33:02.977 --> 33:05.382
Well, I've got to be smarter
than you.

33:05.476 --> 33:07.951
Well, I've been here twice
and you've got nothing

33:07.955 --> 33:08.921
but a Q-tip.

33:08.926 --> 33:10.202
That's all I need.

33:28.477 --> 33:29.862
Here we go.

33:30.777 --> 33:31.541
No.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.263
Nope. No evidence of
meth on the surface,

33:34.265 --> 33:36.792
and that means that he hasn't
been around crystal meth.

33:39.527 --> 33:40.962
Cyclonite.

33:40.978 --> 33:42.710
What's that?
That's RDX.

33:42.777 --> 33:44.160
That's an explosive.

33:44.176 --> 33:47.151
It is an explosive.
There's a bomb in that car.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.550
Well, there you go.

33:53.575 --> 33:55.822
That's why Javier
snuck into the car.

34:03.308 --> 34:05.622
<i>He thought this car would be
back at the depot by now.</i>

34:06.025 --> 34:08.040
<i>He meant to kill the cops
that arrested his brother.</i>

34:08.047 --> 34:10.330
<i>This is totally about revenge.</i>

34:10.775 --> 34:13.092
It's just our luck.

34:15.525 --> 34:16.610
Can you defuse it?

34:16.626 --> 34:19.503
Not with four
minutes, Frank.

34:22.016 --> 34:23.362
What are you going to do?

34:23.378 --> 34:25.333
Going for a ride, Frank.

34:35.308 --> 34:36.621
Aren't you a little
freaked out?

34:36.628 --> 34:39.482
I mean, the curse said that
someone was going to die.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.011
Bang... Ed died.

34:41.074 --> 34:43.012
But you do realize that
the person that told us

34:43.014 --> 34:45.679
about the curse was the person
who killed Ed, don't you?

34:46.516 --> 34:48.221
Oh, yeah, I guess
you have a point.

35:45.076 --> 35:47.370
Burn, baby, burn.

36:12.177 --> 36:13.523
Are you okay?

36:13.578 --> 36:15.180
I won't know for a while.

36:15.276 --> 36:17.053
There were 12 samples
in that centrifuge

36:17.055 --> 36:18.752
and they all came
in contact with my skin.

36:18.845 --> 36:21.561
Have you seen Alexx?
Has she drawn your blood for the EMIT tests?

36:21.575 --> 36:24.461
No, not yet because we're trying
to get this murder solved.

36:24.475 --> 36:26.860
I guess the table
must've splintered

36:26.877 --> 36:28.773
when Delko slammed
that pickax down on it.

36:30.197 --> 36:31.462
The vibrations
from the centrifuge

36:31.477 --> 36:33.150
must've finished the job.

36:47.726 --> 36:49.350
Is everything compromised?

36:49.505 --> 36:50.763
Believe it or not, no.

36:50.777 --> 36:53.693
Only what was being analyzed,
it was a concentrated sample.

36:54.827 --> 36:55.982
These the results?

36:55.986 --> 36:58.970
Amylogenin, XX,
on the mausoleum blood.

36:59.277 --> 37:00.910
Which means the sample
was from a woman.

37:01.676 --> 37:04.311
So Trevor Valone wasn't
the accomplice after all.

37:04.327 --> 37:06.392
It's looking more and
more like Danielle.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.772
Okay. Danielle said
she found Alissa dead,

37:10.778 --> 37:12.743
heard a killer,
freaked out and ran.

37:12.778 --> 37:14.433
All of which checked out.

37:14.438 --> 37:16.863
But does it? I mean,
why is there no evidence

37:16.875 --> 37:18.511
of Danielle
inside Alissa's condo?

37:18.525 --> 37:20.862
We printed everything,
even the doorknob.

37:20.867 --> 37:22.650
There is zip on Danielle.

37:25.675 --> 37:27.860
Unless she wiped
everything down.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.570
That's it. That's what happened.

37:30.575 --> 37:33.520
And everything she wiped away
was either prints or blood.

37:33.636 --> 37:34.660
Okay, so whatever
she used

37:34.668 --> 37:36.982
has to be here with Alissa's
possessions, right?

37:39.775 --> 37:41.463
It's right on
the murder weapon.

37:41.475 --> 37:42.770
And if she wore it like a glove,

37:42.775 --> 37:44.723
there'll be epithelials
on the inside.

37:44.876 --> 37:46.623
So Danielle
was Jeremy's partner.

37:46.627 --> 37:48.462
Her job was to
get rid of Alissa,

37:48.466 --> 37:51.412
use the golf clubs
to frame Trevor, the ex,

37:51.425 --> 37:53.500
then get away as fast
as she could.

37:53.585 --> 37:55.413
You don't want
to do this, Danielle.

37:55.427 --> 37:58.830
I get to have Jeremy
and the gold.

37:59.176 --> 38:00.673
I don't need you.

38:08.678 --> 38:10.663
<i>They used the mausoleum
to sort the gold.</i>

38:10.678 --> 38:13.950
<i>She must've cut her hand
while moving the gold bars.</i>

38:14.876 --> 38:15.822
Ouch.

38:18.148 --> 38:21.080
<i>Her voice was picked up
by the graveside microphone.</i>

38:23.327 --> 38:25.162
But she took the wrong car.

38:25.977 --> 38:28.360
Which means she could be
in her own car right now.

38:28.378 --> 38:30.622
Homicide confirmed
she picked it up this afternoon.

38:30.726 --> 38:33.173
And her navigation system
is activated.

38:54.528 --> 38:56.130
Officer Delko?

38:57.228 --> 38:59.251
I see you got your gold back.

39:01.175 --> 39:03.313
Rewards have a way
of compelling people.

39:03.328 --> 39:05.460
A million in cash
is a nice incentive.

39:05.476 --> 39:07.460
Yeah, well,
someone killed to collect it.

39:07.477 --> 39:10.053
Yeah. Killed the man
who took it.

39:10.177 --> 39:12.162
You'll forgive me
if I'm not too broken up.

39:12.178 --> 39:13.860
Where's the woman
who returned the gold?

39:13.875 --> 39:15.261
Danielle Madison?

39:15.518 --> 39:18.372
Oh, see, the deal was
no questions asked.

39:18.478 --> 39:19.860
I'm a man of my word.

39:19.878 --> 39:21.722
No, you're aiding a killer.

39:22.158 --> 39:24.000
Hmm. Good luck proving that.

39:24.006 --> 39:27.672
But, if I was a betting man,
and I am...

39:28.676 --> 39:30.762
...I'd say she's nowhere
near Miami.

39:30.775 --> 39:33.310
Left her car behind,
put one over on you.

39:33.326 --> 39:35.163
Give me time, Solner.

39:35.178 --> 39:36.680
I'm going to find her.

39:40.337 --> 39:41.221
Hey.

39:43.178 --> 39:44.753
Heard you had a
close call today.

39:44.765 --> 39:47.101
Well, we all did.

39:48.127 --> 39:50.161
Did you get a chance
to see Alexx?

39:51.265 --> 39:53.023
Yeah, I feel like
a total pincushion.

39:53.027 --> 39:56.362
But I should know if I'm healthy
in about... about a week.

39:56.378 --> 39:58.883
Good. If you, um...

39:58.926 --> 40:01.470
if you feel you need
to take some time, that's okay.

40:01.478 --> 40:02.461
Thank you.

40:02.475 --> 40:04.852
I think I'm going to be
of more use here though.

40:05.177 --> 40:05.743
Okay.

40:07.375 --> 40:08.442
I guess you just...

40:09.487 --> 40:11.531
you never know
when death is coming.

40:12.076 --> 40:16.583
No, we don't, and that's why
we shouldn't live in fear of it.

40:17.945 --> 40:18.900
You're right.

40:21.525 --> 40:22.440
You're right.

40:24.927 --> 40:26.531
Then I will see you tomorrow.

40:26.547 --> 40:28.391
You will see me tomorrow.

40:38.636 --> 40:41.171
All that, and we didn't even
find our killer.

40:41.275 --> 40:44.063
Miami International has no
records of Danielle's departure.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.960
I checked with
the Port. Nothing.

40:45.975 --> 40:49.060
So, uh, looks like
she got away with it.

40:49.176 --> 40:51.233
And you still don't believe
that there's a curse?

40:51.246 --> 40:52.612
I mean, if you ask me,
it seems like

40:52.627 --> 40:55.440
Danielle is being protected
by some sort of...

40:55.977 --> 40:57.430
unseen force.

40:57.435 --> 40:59.452
No, the only thing protecting
her was luck.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.073
She'll screw up eventually.

41:01.636 --> 41:03.753
So, what, none of this
means anything to you?

41:04.148 --> 41:04.711
Hm-mm.

41:05.305 --> 41:06.430
I don't believe in curses.

41:06.438 --> 41:07.351
I believe in Karma.

41:07.876 --> 41:09.292
Well, at least
this case is over,

41:09.296 --> 41:12.332
and to, um, whichever one of you
put away that little coffin,

41:12.335 --> 41:16.372
thank you, because I don't ever
want to see that thing again.

41:20.775 --> 41:22.362
One of you guys
put it away, right?

41:22.366 --> 41:23.011
I didn't.

41:23.027 --> 41:25.471
You know how I feel
about Santeria.

41:25.506 --> 41:27.021
I never touched it.

41:27.675 --> 41:29.663
Are you messing with me?

41:29.717 --> 41:32.753
I don't think that would be
very good Karma.

41:37.186 --> 41:39.842
Hold Señora.
Thank you.

41:40.508 --> 41:43.000
* Muito obrigado *
Thank you so much
