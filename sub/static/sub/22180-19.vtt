WEBVTT

00:01.970 --> 00:04.951
Ugh. I am dreading this trip.

00:04.952 --> 00:06.253
Come on. You love Montreal.

00:06.254 --> 00:08.789
Not when the hosts
are stabbing me in the back.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.158
That was Jay with

00:11.159 --> 00:12.359
the advance team.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.760
Last week, this group

00:13.761 --> 00:16.897
of Canadian divers
discovered this wreckage

00:16.898 --> 00:21.268
of the HMS <i>Wanderer,</i>
disappeared in 1848

00:21.269 --> 00:23.303
while trying to reach the North Pole.

00:23.304 --> 00:25.155
With a name like that,
I'm not surprised.

00:25.156 --> 00:29.943
They're claiming it planted a flag
for Canada in the Northwest Passage.

00:29.944 --> 00:32.267
Because it sank there in 1848?

00:32.268 --> 00:35.382
Right? And meanwhile,

00:35.383 --> 00:39.453
Russia, Norway, Denmark
are all calling dibs.

00:39.454 --> 00:41.221
On the North Pole?

00:41.222 --> 00:43.023
Well, I guess Santa will be next.

00:43.024 --> 00:44.124
The fact is,

00:44.125 --> 00:47.461
the melting ice cap is,
among other things,

00:47.462 --> 00:50.230
a massive strategic opportunity.

00:50.231 --> 00:52.999
Shipping lanes, natural resources,

00:53.000 --> 00:54.234
fishing rights.

00:54.235 --> 00:57.938
What we achieve at this
summit could well determine

00:57.939 --> 01:01.041
the balance of power for
the next... hundred years.

01:01.042 --> 01:02.576
Assuming the world exists.

01:02.577 --> 01:05.412
Not a given, at the rate
the ice is melting up there.

01:05.413 --> 01:08.415
Thanks, Dr. Doom, but I
actually have to just focus

01:08.416 --> 01:10.784
on one monumental
global issue at a time.

01:10.785 --> 01:12.452
JASON: Has anyone seen my passport?

01:12.453 --> 01:15.689
The one I found in the dryer
after the India trip?

01:15.690 --> 01:17.824
- Possibly.
- Yeah, I have it.

01:17.825 --> 01:20.327
So, are you getting
psyched for Montreal?

01:20.328 --> 01:22.896
Ah, not as much as Piper.
She's all about Bella Rossi

01:22.897 --> 01:24.798
and the big scoop
for the school paper.

01:24.799 --> 01:26.399
How cool is it that Mom is letting you

01:26.400 --> 01:27.567
tag along with your girlfriend

01:27.568 --> 01:29.603
so she can interview
the woman who's gonna be

01:29.604 --> 01:32.139
outside the hotel protesting Mom

01:32.140 --> 01:33.340
and the summit?

01:33.341 --> 01:34.474
It's pretty cool, I guess.

01:34.475 --> 01:36.209
Gosh, I'm overwhelmed.

01:36.210 --> 01:37.878
HENRY: Well, listen, there are some

01:37.879 --> 01:39.079
beautiful churches up there

01:39.080 --> 01:40.514
you guys might want
to check out. You know,

01:40.515 --> 01:41.848
the Jesuits were
the first missionaries

01:41.849 --> 01:43.717
- to New France.
- First?!

01:43.718 --> 01:46.486
Wow! I should finish packing.

01:46.487 --> 01:48.722
Yeah, they were the radical
reformers of their day.

01:48.723 --> 01:50.223
You... ah.

01:50.224 --> 01:54.628
Oh, honey, I think that Jesuit
churches are pretty cool.

01:54.629 --> 01:56.163
Well, I don't know how

01:56.164 --> 01:58.165
the Canadians are gonna
be able to resist you, eh?

01:58.166 --> 02:00.199
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

02:01.868 --> 02:03.236
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:03.237 --> 02:05.105
Oh, the secretary said she wants
to stop by the Chip Harding

02:05.106 --> 02:06.606
- meeting on the way to Andrews.
- Hmm.

02:06.607 --> 02:07.833
But she said to get
started without her.

02:07.834 --> 02:08.775
Copy that.

02:08.776 --> 02:10.610
You ready for your part
of the Future Energy pitch?

02:10.610 --> 02:13.180
- Oh, of course.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:13.181 --> 02:14.548
You're the one that wanted
to get more involved in policy.

02:14.549 --> 02:16.249
And I'm very thankful to the secretary

02:16.250 --> 02:18.051
for allowing me to spread my wings

02:18.052 --> 02:19.953
under your expert
supervision, of course.

02:19.954 --> 02:21.788
It's just... it just burns me

02:21.789 --> 02:23.857
that we have to suck
up to an oil magnate.

02:23.858 --> 02:26.259
- Blake, Congress cut our...
- Cut our funding. I know.

02:26.260 --> 02:28.261
The last word on practically
every state initiative.

02:28.262 --> 02:30.530
And I get why the World
Expo is a critical showcase

02:30.531 --> 02:33.066
for American companies in a
ferocious global marketplace.

02:33.067 --> 02:34.467
It's just...

02:34.468 --> 02:36.770
It's just a tad ironic
that our big opportunity

02:36.771 --> 02:38.872
to promote American
renewable energy at the expo

02:38.873 --> 02:41.208
is being sponsored by Big Oil and Gas.

02:41.209 --> 02:43.543
Dude, this is not the irony hill
you want to die on.

02:43.544 --> 02:46.613
If Chip Harding doesn't pony up,
we'll be saying "Buy American"

02:46.614 --> 02:48.248
with dioramas and sock puppets.

02:48.249 --> 02:50.350
So let's get on board,
'cause this is our only shot

02:50.351 --> 02:51.725
to compete with China
at the expo, okay?

02:51.726 --> 02:52.817
Yeah.

02:52.818 --> 02:53.770
- Come on.
- Okay.

02:53.771 --> 02:54.754
- We got this.
- Okay.

02:54.755 --> 02:57.056
BLAKE: <i>And then the Hall
of Renewables is here.</i>

02:59.159 --> 03:00.994
I heard China has a holodeck,

03:00.995 --> 03:03.730
robot dancers, and free hoverboards.

03:03.731 --> 03:05.732
Well, we have food by Rachael Ray.

03:05.733 --> 03:07.701
And a pre-taped video
of Jennifer Lawrence

03:07.702 --> 03:09.402
personally lobbying world leaders

03:09.403 --> 03:11.671
on behalf of American
companies like yours.

03:11.672 --> 03:14.474
- Mm-hmm.
- But your pitch

03:14.475 --> 03:17.310
has a fundamental problem.

03:17.311 --> 03:18.240
The nuclear power section?

03:18.241 --> 03:19.713
It's taking up a lot
of real estate here,

03:19.714 --> 03:22.249
and you've neglected
good old natural gas.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.418
Well, nuclear power produces
carbon-free electricity,

03:25.419 --> 03:27.354
while natural gas does not.

03:27.355 --> 03:29.489
And most climate scientists
see nuclear

03:29.490 --> 03:31.258
as the key transition technology

03:31.259 --> 03:33.093
until renewables
become more efficient.

03:33.094 --> 03:36.196
The bridge to renewables
is not nuclear, my dear.

03:36.197 --> 03:37.330
It's gas.

03:37.331 --> 03:39.366
It's cheap, has half
the emissions of coal,

03:39.367 --> 03:41.268
and most importantly,
it won't melt down

03:41.269 --> 03:43.637
and make the neighborhood
children glow in the dark.

03:43.638 --> 03:45.739
Uh, due respect, Mr. Harding,

03:45.740 --> 03:48.275
no child or anyone has ever
glowed in the dark from any...

03:48.276 --> 03:50.110
- Ma'am.
- Mr. Harding.

03:50.111 --> 03:51.711
So good to see you again.

03:51.712 --> 03:54.281
I'm on my way to Montreal,
but I couldn't leave

03:54.282 --> 03:55.615
without stopping in to say hi.

03:55.616 --> 03:58.151
I'm happy to hear that
the Arctic is a top priority

03:58.152 --> 03:59.653
of the Dalton administration.

03:59.654 --> 04:00.887
It's a brave new world.

04:00.888 --> 04:02.589
Everybody wants a piece,
myself included.

04:02.590 --> 04:06.426
Well, I am eager to
negotiate a contract

04:06.427 --> 04:07.928
that will be fair to all of us.

04:07.929 --> 04:11.197
And I wanted to thank you again
for your generous pledge

04:11.198 --> 04:13.133
to our World Expo pavilion. Wow.

04:13.134 --> 04:14.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yes.

04:14.302 --> 04:15.568
- Yes.
- Yeah.

04:15.569 --> 04:17.504
It is being held
in my home state of Texas.

04:17.505 --> 04:20.473
Wouldn't want to fumble the ball
on the home field, right?

04:20.474 --> 04:22.909
Not at all, which is why
I'm so concerned

04:22.910 --> 04:24.945
there's no section on natural gas.

04:24.946 --> 04:27.580
If we're talking future energy,
we need to tell folks

04:27.581 --> 04:30.216
that gas is cheap,
has half the emissions of coal,

04:30.217 --> 04:32.919
and most importantly,
folks won't glow in the dark.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.421
Let me tell you something else.

04:34.422 --> 04:36.489
So, wait, nuclear's gone,
just like that?

04:36.490 --> 04:39.526
Well, it's not gone, it's just,

04:39.527 --> 04:41.494
it's not a part of "future energy."

04:41.495 --> 04:43.563
Okay, well, can it be part of...?

04:43.564 --> 04:45.432
Kat, have you heard anything
from Jay at the summit?

04:45.433 --> 04:47.233
Deputy talks suggest that Canada
is still holding firm

04:47.234 --> 04:48.735
on the HMS <i>Wanderer.</i>

04:48.736 --> 04:51.137
Crap.

04:51.138 --> 04:53.840
Okay, I have spent weeks
with those briefing books.

04:53.841 --> 04:55.575
- I know full well...
- I know. Hey, kids!

04:55.576 --> 04:56.943
You excited about your trip?

04:56.944 --> 04:58.211
- Yeah.
- Do you need anything?

04:58.212 --> 05:01.047
- I'm good, thanks.
- Uh... snacks, juice.

05:01.048 --> 05:02.415
How about a bedtime story?

05:02.416 --> 05:04.417
- Uh, have a great trip.
- Thanks.

05:04.418 --> 05:06.119
- Yeah.
- BLAKE: I'll apologize later.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.111
Okay.

05:07.112 --> 05:09.189
Look, 16 of the 17 of the
hottest years on record

05:09.190 --> 05:10.690
have occurred since 2000.

05:10.691 --> 05:13.493
The North Pole is the hottest
it's been in 1,500 years.

05:13.494 --> 05:15.495
Did you see the video
of that starving polar bear?

05:15.496 --> 05:17.097
- Because it is just awful.
- No. I did, I did,

05:17.098 --> 05:18.264
because you showed it
to me several times.

05:18.265 --> 05:19.532
- Okay.
- Let's just go right into my...

05:19.533 --> 05:20.834
Well, look, natural gas
is better than coal...

05:20.835 --> 05:22.669
I will give you that...
but that's still a lot of CO2.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.170
And-and renewables are great,

05:24.171 --> 05:26.406
but you need, like,
12 billion solar roofs

05:26.407 --> 05:28.141
just to match the projected growth

05:28.142 --> 05:30.410
in energy consumption by 2050,

05:30.411 --> 05:32.946
which wind and solar won't
even come close to filling,

05:32.947 --> 05:34.881
unless something magical happens,

05:34.882 --> 05:37.584
which doesn't seem like
a very good plan to me.

05:37.585 --> 05:39.085
You are preaching to the choir, man.

05:39.086 --> 05:41.221
Do you know how many
Americans have died

05:41.222 --> 05:43.857
from commercial nuclear power
accidents since World War II?

05:43.858 --> 05:45.692
- Zero.
- Zero.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.694
And that includes Three Mile Island.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.329
People only died at Chernobyl

05:49.330 --> 05:51.164
because they didn't have
a containment dome.

05:51.165 --> 05:52.399
And when it comes to waste,

05:52.400 --> 05:55.235
the world's entire
supply of spent uranium

05:55.236 --> 05:57.670
from reactors could fit
on a single football field.

05:57.671 --> 05:59.973
Meanwhile, this expo has the potential

05:59.974 --> 06:01.574
to generate thousands of green jobs.

06:01.575 --> 06:04.778
I know. I guess it's
picking our battles.

06:04.779 --> 06:07.347
Besides, we can't even begin
to turn the tide on nuclear

06:07.348 --> 06:09.983
until we have backing from
a major environmental group,

06:09.984 --> 06:14.387
like the... I don't know...
NRDC or Climate Defense Force.

06:14.388 --> 06:16.556
- (SIGHS)
- Yeah.

06:16.557 --> 06:19.225
All right.

06:19.226 --> 06:21.761
I'll give the heads-up to
the ECA and the Expo Unit

06:21.762 --> 06:23.830
about the redesign.

06:23.831 --> 06:25.865
- All right. Hey, Blake?
- Yeah.

06:25.866 --> 06:27.901
You've done really good work.

06:27.902 --> 06:29.869
Thank you.

06:29.870 --> 06:32.171
Yeah.

06:34.874 --> 06:37.877
The British ship <i>Laconia</i>
was carrying more

06:37.878 --> 06:40.280
than 2,000 soldiers,
crew and passengers

06:40.281 --> 06:43.083
when it was torpedoed and sunk
by a German U-boat.

06:43.084 --> 06:45.985
And the German crewmen
were actually in the process

06:45.986 --> 06:49.522
of rescuing the survivors
when they were spotted

06:49.523 --> 06:54.594
by USAAF bomber pilot
Lieutenant James D. Harden.

06:54.595 --> 06:56.296
Even though the Germans

06:56.297 --> 06:58.364
broadcast their humanitarian intent

06:58.365 --> 07:01.334
on open channels and were flying
the-the Red Cross flag,

07:01.335 --> 07:02.669
what did Harden do?

07:02.670 --> 07:04.704
- He bombed the sub.
- That's right.

07:04.705 --> 07:07.907
The panicked U-boat crew threw
the survivors off the deck

07:07.908 --> 07:09.542
to make their escape.

07:09.543 --> 07:12.946
More than a thousand people
died, including civilians.

07:12.947 --> 07:15.048
It was hushed up at the time,
and Harden even

07:15.049 --> 07:17.750
won a medal, but in today's world,

07:17.751 --> 07:20.286
would his actions classify
as a war crime?

07:20.287 --> 07:21.955
Yeah.

07:21.956 --> 07:25.258
Yes. There were clearly
innocents aboard the sub.

07:25.259 --> 07:27.127
Harden and his senior officer

07:27.128 --> 07:28.962
who issued the order
should have been prosecuted.

07:28.963 --> 07:30.630
MAN: Prosecuted?

07:30.631 --> 07:33.166
For not taking the word
of an enemy U-boat commander?

07:33.167 --> 07:35.335
The sub had just sunk
an Allied vessel.

07:35.336 --> 07:37.403
Harden knew if he didn't
destroy the sub now,

07:37.404 --> 07:39.606
it would just go on
to sink more ships,

07:39.607 --> 07:41.541
cost more lives.

07:41.542 --> 07:42.909
As a fellow fighter pilot,

07:42.910 --> 07:44.410
I sure know what I would have done.

07:44.411 --> 07:48.114
Thomas Aquinas said that war is just

07:48.115 --> 07:49.682
if the ultimate goal is peace.

07:49.683 --> 07:51.851
Harden was acting
for the greater good.

07:51.852 --> 07:53.620
Well argued, Lieutenant Hill,

07:53.621 --> 07:55.455
but with all due respect to Aquinas,

07:55.456 --> 07:57.023
there were 80 women and children

07:57.024 --> 07:59.292
in the lifeboats that Harden bombed.

07:59.293 --> 08:02.160
Was killing them
in support of the greater good?

08:03.363 --> 08:05.865
Just something to consider.

08:05.866 --> 08:08.101
All right, that's it for today.
That was a very good discussion.

08:08.102 --> 08:10.136
Thanks. Oh, and papers, please...

08:10.137 --> 08:13.206
Stoic strength and
Epictetus' teleology.

08:13.207 --> 08:15.507
Hard copies and PDFs, okay?

08:16.643 --> 08:19.179
Uh, is it okay if I drop off my paper

08:19.180 --> 08:20.847
- later, Dr. McCord?
- Yeah. Is everything okay?

08:20.848 --> 08:23.183
Yeah, I just want to read
over it one more time.

08:23.184 --> 08:24.150
Okay, just make sure I get it

Our access to the Arctic is
vital to the global economy.

10:48.629 --> 10:50.897
The designation
"Arctic power" is based

10:50.898 --> 10:52.365
on simple geography, Minister.

KONSTANTIN: When Canada
was a part of Britain.

11:27.935 --> 11:29.302

has the world's

11:29.303 --> 11:30.370
longest Arctic coastline.

11:30.371 --> 11:32.238

of the Arctic's population.

shelf extends to the North Pole.

11:45.152 --> 11:48.221
America has its own claims
on the Chukchi Ridge.

11:48.222 --> 11:50.022
Which is Russian.

11:50.023 --> 11:51.858
We recognize the ambiguity.

11:51.859 --> 11:55.027
Which is why we propose
an independent survey

11:55.028 --> 11:56.596

11:56.597 --> 11:58.364
administered by the U.N.

11:58.365 --> 12:02.234

of this council.

12:03.703 --> 12:06.806
The domestic reaction

12:06.807 --> 12:08.975
to such an agreement
could be complicated.

12:08.976 --> 12:13.111
Which is why I suggest we keep
the terms classified. For now.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.482
We Norwegians would consider
such a proposal.

12:16.483 --> 12:18.618
In principle, Denmark agrees.

12:18.619 --> 12:20.653
Russia has no objection.

12:20.654 --> 12:23.222
Provided that Canada withdraws

12:23.223 --> 12:25.358
its latest far-fetched claim.

12:25.359 --> 12:28.795
A sunken ship. Preposterous.

12:28.796 --> 12:31.097
It's hard to argue
with a neutral survey.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.832
The people of Canada are willing

12:32.833 --> 12:35.568
to provisionally withdraw
our perfectly reasonable

12:35.569 --> 12:38.805
and genuine claim based on the
sinking of the HMS <i>Wanderer.</i>

12:38.806 --> 12:41.073
In that case, I'd like
to propose a short recess

12:41.074 --> 12:42.875

17:11.862 --> 17:14.497
for the deception.

17:14.498 --> 17:17.066
Says that she just
wanted their first time

17:17.067 --> 17:20.336
to be special and
romantic, and I guess

17:20.337 --> 17:22.539
Jason went along with the plan,

17:22.540 --> 17:24.540
right down to Luther Vandross

17:24.541 --> 17:26.742
and chocolate-covered strawberries.

17:26.743 --> 17:28.645
It's like they wanted
to have sex in the '80s.

17:28.646 --> 17:30.380
(EXHALES)

17:30.381 --> 17:34.584
But Piper's apology does not
get Jason off the hook.

17:34.585 --> 17:37.387
- Oh, not by a long shot.
- Okay.

17:37.388 --> 17:39.088
(SIGHS)

17:39.089 --> 17:40.890
He's the son
of the secretary of state.

17:40.891 --> 17:44.860
We were on an official
U.S. diplomatic mission.

17:45.862 --> 17:47.430
What happened to taking responsibility

17:47.431 --> 17:48.498
for your decisions?

17:48.499 --> 17:49.632
To thinking before you act?

17:49.633 --> 17:52.502
Here I was, thinking that my son,

17:52.503 --> 17:55.004
or at least his... girlfriend,

17:55.005 --> 17:58.641
would be interested
in what I was doing.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.977
Turns out it was all a
ruse just to have sex

18:00.978 --> 18:02.645
in a country that speaks French.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.814
And what, are we supposed
to just continue

18:04.815 --> 18:06.883
to clean up their messes
for the rest of their lives

18:06.884 --> 18:09.586
because they turned out
to be lazy and entitled

18:09.587 --> 18:10.887
and self-destructive?

18:10.888 --> 18:12.455
Willing to risk everything
that's important

18:12.456 --> 18:14.057
in their lives, while we just

18:14.058 --> 18:15.959
whistle past their...

18:15.960 --> 18:18.495
deception and misconduct?

18:18.496 --> 18:20.797
Are we still talking
about Jason and Piper?

18:20.798 --> 18:23.166
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

18:23.167 --> 18:27.370
I-I-I also had a crappy
situation with a student.

18:27.371 --> 18:28.938
And it's more than a little fraught.

18:28.939 --> 18:31.908
You mean that someone
else's kid screwed up?

18:31.909 --> 18:33.810
I'm all ears. Let's hear it.

18:33.811 --> 18:35.979
He turned in a paper,

18:35.980 --> 18:38.581
and sections of it were
lifted from an essay

18:38.582 --> 18:40.383
by a student of mine from Georgetown.

18:40.384 --> 18:41.885
I guess he found it on the Internet

18:41.886 --> 18:44.287
and didn't realize
it was from my class.

18:44.288 --> 18:46.189
- Wow.
- Yeah.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.924
Has he ever done anything
like this before?

18:47.925 --> 18:49.058
No. That's the thing.

18:49.059 --> 18:50.560
The kid is a rock star.
First in his class

18:50.561 --> 18:52.562
at Air Force Academy,
first in officer's training.

18:52.563 --> 18:55.999
He's a natural pilot and he loves it.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.669
And now I'm gonna have to
report him to the commandant.

18:59.670 --> 19:01.604
Punishment starts with NJP

19:01.605 --> 19:03.473
and could lead to a court-martial.

19:03.474 --> 19:04.707
And, babe...

19:04.708 --> 19:08.177
It's Ellen Hill's son, Andrew.

19:08.178 --> 19:11.147
Oh, my God.

19:11.148 --> 19:14.350
Anything less than him
rising to general

19:14.351 --> 19:16.719
or even president will be

19:16.720 --> 19:19.022
- a bitter disappointment to Ellen.
- I've got to report him.

19:19.023 --> 19:21.090
Things are gonna be a little
awkward at the next NSC meeting.

19:23.993 --> 19:25.828
Jay, tell me you have some good news.

19:25.829 --> 19:27.230
JAY: Bella Rossi

19:27.231 --> 19:28.965
turned over the names
of the violent protesters

19:28.966 --> 19:30.199
to Canadian authorities.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.434
Great. Are they in custody?

19:31.435 --> 19:33.970
No, ma'am. The names were all aliases.

19:33.971 --> 19:35.371
Canadian Intelligence traced one

19:35.372 --> 19:38.775
to a Twitter handle controlled
by an Internet research agency

19:38.776 --> 19:41.611
in the Olgino district
of St. Petersburg.

19:41.612 --> 19:43.780
You have to be kidding me.

19:43.781 --> 19:44.948
They're Russian agents, ma'am.

19:44.949 --> 19:47.917
Russia spiked the summit?

19:47.918 --> 19:50.219
Using GRU assets planted inside

19:50.220 --> 19:52.655
an American NGO for more than a year.

19:52.656 --> 19:54.324
That's some deep game.

19:54.325 --> 19:56.960
That's Russia.

19:56.961 --> 20:01.129
Whatever they're up to in the
Arctic, it's just the beginning.

Once again,
you make Russia your bogeyman.

20:15.975 --> 20:18.243
No, that's all on you.

20:18.244 --> 20:21.746
CIA confirmed Canadian
Intelligence findings,

20:21.747 --> 20:23.948
so you can skip the denial.

20:23.949 --> 20:26.684
Our Treasury Department is preparing

20:26.685 --> 20:28.686
to levy retaliatory sanctions

20:28.687 --> 20:31.923
under Executive Order 13660.

20:31.924 --> 20:33.892
This is a serious escalation.

20:33.893 --> 20:36.294
I'm sorry, what?

20:36.295 --> 20:38.830
You infiltrated a peaceful protest

20:38.831 --> 20:41.299
and set off an antipersonnel bomb.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.968
And it is a miracle that no
one in the crowd was killed,

20:43.969 --> 20:45.970
including my son and his girlfriend.

20:45.971 --> 20:50.642
I didn't realize Jason
was at the conference.

20:50.643 --> 20:52.443
I can't imagine what you went through.

20:52.444 --> 20:53.878
No, you really can't.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.947
(SIGHS) And I could not have imagined

20:55.948 --> 20:57.315
inviting you back to the table

20:57.316 --> 21:00.351
after what you did,
but the planet can't wait.

21:00.352 --> 21:03.454
So you need to get serious
about negotiating.

21:03.455 --> 21:05.857
You may have bought Alaska,

21:05.858 --> 21:08.560
but the Arctic is in our blood.

21:08.561 --> 21:11.529
Your sanctions won't deter us.

21:11.530 --> 21:15.533
I'm glad your boy is okay.

21:15.534 --> 21:17.802
They've already been caught.

21:17.803 --> 21:19.203
What do they have to gain

21:19.204 --> 21:21.638
by continuing to obstruct?

21:23.041 --> 21:25.909
Blake, get me Ephraim Ware.

21:26.844 --> 21:31.015
I'm gonna put whatever
Intel assets we have

21:31.016 --> 21:34.618
in the Arctic on high alert
until we can find out.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.621
(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)

21:50.902 --> 21:52.570

21:52.571 --> 21:55.439
No, it's fine.

21:56.841 --> 21:59.410
How'd you find me?

21:59.411 --> 22:02.747
Former spy.

22:02.748 --> 22:05.583
Look, Andrew.
I can't accept your paper.

22:05.584 --> 22:08.518
I think you know why.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.287
Thought I'd give you
a chance to explain

22:11.288 --> 22:12.588
before I go to the commandant.

22:12.589 --> 22:14.590
I have no defense.

22:14.591 --> 22:16.292
You should do whatever
it is you have to do.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.927
Really?

22:17.928 --> 22:20.063
So no plea for leniency, no do-over?

22:20.064 --> 22:22.498
I have too much respect
for you, Dr. McCord.

22:22.499 --> 22:24.367
You're an ethical man.

22:24.368 --> 22:26.469
Yeah, that's the reputation I have,

22:26.470 --> 22:28.737
and you were counting
on that, weren't you?

22:29.472 --> 22:31.706
I don't know what you mean.

22:33.476 --> 22:35.745
Look, Andrew...

22:35.746 --> 22:38.181
at first I thought that in
addition to being lazy,

22:38.182 --> 22:39.882
you were also incredibly careless.

22:39.883 --> 22:41.351
But then I realized

22:41.352 --> 22:43.219
those two words
are the last I'd ever use

22:43.220 --> 22:45.288
to describe you.
You did it on purpose.

22:45.289 --> 22:48.056
I just don't know why.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.595
You know that poem by John Magee?

22:52.596 --> 22:54.097
"High Flight"?

22:54.098 --> 22:57.033
"Oh! I have slipped
the surly bonds of Earth

22:57.034 --> 22:59.802
and danced the skies
on laughter-silvered wings."

22:59.803 --> 23:01.269
Yeah. Why?

23:01.971 --> 23:04.407
Ever since I joined the Air Force,

23:04.408 --> 23:06.642
I was trained to kill.

23:06.643 --> 23:10.346
Simulations, training runs.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.615
You know it isn't real,

23:12.616 --> 23:15.118
and you tell yourself that maybe
by the time it is real,

23:15.119 --> 23:17.687
that it'll just feel automatic.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.689
Follow the orders.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.890
Fly home.

23:24.627 --> 23:27.430
The last lines of that poem,

23:27.431 --> 23:31.267
"And, while with silent,
lifting mind I've trod,

23:31.268 --> 23:33.102
"the high, untrespassed

23:33.103 --> 23:35.471
"sanctity of space,

23:35.472 --> 23:40.108

and touched the face of God."

23:43.312 --> 23:45.914
I feel like I've touched
the face of God.

23:46.649 --> 23:48.750
I can't do it.

23:50.486 --> 23:53.121
I can't kill.

23:54.857 --> 23:58.261
Yesterday you cited
Aquinas and just war.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.363
Killing in war
is different than murder,

24:00.364 --> 24:03.165
and, sadly, there are times
when it's necessary.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.771
I get that.

24:04.772 --> 24:07.036
And I thought that maybe
by taking that position,

24:07.037 --> 24:09.639
I could chase away my doubts.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.808
I'm not a pacifist, Dr. McCord,

24:11.809 --> 24:13.476
and I'm not afraid of dying,

24:13.477 --> 24:15.011
but I can't reconcile

24:15.012 --> 24:16.279
the questions you've been raising

24:16.280 --> 24:18.147
in class, and that made me realize

24:18.148 --> 24:20.216
that I can't live with the
guilt of taking a life.

24:20.217 --> 24:23.319
A civilian life. An innocent.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.021
Not even an enemy.

24:28.791 --> 24:30.793
Have you told your mom?

24:30.794 --> 24:34.897
My mom was chairwoman
of the Joint Chiefs.

24:34.898 --> 24:37.366
Now she's national security advisor.

24:37.367 --> 24:39.235
Service is everything to her.

24:39.236 --> 24:41.471
I can't.

24:41.472 --> 24:43.806
So rather than tell her,

24:43.807 --> 24:47.310
- you plagiarized your ethics paper.
- In the moment,

24:47.311 --> 24:49.879
it seemed like it was
better for her to believe

24:49.880 --> 24:52.115
that my career ended
over a lapse in judgment.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.616
I don't know how to tell her

24:53.617 --> 24:54.817
that this is my choice.

24:54.818 --> 24:56.552
Andrew, if there's one thing
I know about you,

24:56.553 --> 24:59.055
you're not a coward.

24:59.056 --> 25:01.324
There are things that you can do,

25:01.325 --> 25:03.759
steps to take.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.661
But your mom deserves
to hear about it from you.

25:10.533 --> 25:11.767
Petroleum, natural gas,

25:11.768 --> 25:14.170

25:23.080 --> 25:24.747
By the way, I-I'm sorry
we didn't have time

25:24.748 --> 25:26.449
to make a new model, ma'am.

25:26.450 --> 25:28.684
No, I'm sorry

25:28.685 --> 25:31.654
that circumstances have
put us in this position.

25:31.655 --> 25:35.490

to fight climate change.

For any part my group
played in the violence

26:01.851 --> 26:03.653
I cooperated with the authorities

26:03.654 --> 26:05.121
because I stand against violence,

26:05.122 --> 26:08.090
but silence is not a
condition of my freedom.

26:08.091 --> 26:11.260
We will never stop denouncing

the truth about global warming

26:14.131 --> 26:15.798
- and continue to poison the planet.
- What is she doing?

26:15.799 --> 26:17.833
- She was just supposed to apologize.
- Well, you can lead

27:17.227 --> 27:18.327
Because of Bella Rossi?

27:18.328 --> 27:22.064
Because I refused to endorse
Arctic drilling.

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

27:23.400 --> 27:24.667
And I may also

27:24.668 --> 27:28.437
have mentioned
his company's long history

27:28.438 --> 27:31.040
of hiding data
and denying climate change.

27:31.041 --> 27:32.808
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER) And violating

27:32.809 --> 27:34.610
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,

27:34.611 --> 27:36.912
so that probably did it.

27:36.913 --> 27:37.947
That explains it.

27:37.948 --> 27:39.681
I like your style.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.555
Andrew filed for Class O-1.

27:46.556 --> 27:49.691
Permanent change in status.

27:50.493 --> 27:52.962
I know how much
his service meant to you.

27:52.963 --> 27:55.498
"There are things you can do,
steps to take."

27:55.499 --> 27:56.932
Did you really tell him that?

27:56.933 --> 27:58.801
Yes.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.069
Knowing where it would lead.

28:00.070 --> 28:02.872
- Ellen, he followed his conscience.
- No.

28:02.873 --> 28:04.874
He's in the thrall
of his ethics professor,

28:04.875 --> 28:07.575
- and you're going to talk him out of it.
- I can't do that.

28:10.413 --> 28:12.281
When he was six,

28:12.282 --> 28:15.084
he begged to quit karate.

28:15.085 --> 28:18.054
Said he didn't want to hurt
any other kids.

28:18.055 --> 28:21.424
Then he won state title. Twice.

28:21.425 --> 28:23.359
Your class...

28:23.360 --> 28:25.328
You've turned him into a philosopher,

28:25.329 --> 28:26.629
and that might be fine

28:26.630 --> 28:28.130
for an ethics professor,

28:28.131 --> 28:31.233
but it is not the job
of a fighter pilot.

28:31.234 --> 28:34.236
- Ellen...
- Please.

29:01.122 --> 29:02.923
nothing would have happened, anyway,

Piper's hotel room.

29:30.251 --> 29:32.452
Which we paid for, by the way.

29:32.453 --> 29:35.122
Yeah. Not only did you deceive us

her interview after...

(GRUNTS)

37:24.499 --> 37:28.636
My father was a sergeant
with the 6th Armored

37:28.637 --> 37:31.906
when they liberated Buchenwald.

37:31.907 --> 37:33.541
(SCOFFS, CLICKS TONGUE)

37:33.542 --> 37:37.243
His generation fought
for something existential.

37:38.045 --> 37:39.780
We just played chicken
with the Russians

37:39.781 --> 37:42.216
over a slice of frozen wasteland

37:42.217 --> 37:44.452
that spends six months
of the year in total darkness.

37:44.453 --> 37:47.755
The world is changing rapidly.

37:47.756 --> 37:50.324
We're all just struggling to keep up.

37:50.325 --> 37:51.425
Yeah.

37:51.426 --> 37:53.094
Teaming up with the Chinese.

37:53.095 --> 37:54.061
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

37:54.062 --> 37:56.564
Have to admit, I did
not see that coming.

37:56.565 --> 37:59.734
You know what I can't
get out of my head?

37:59.735 --> 38:02.303
That Chinese icebreaker

38:02.304 --> 38:05.539
can push through 20-foot-thick ice

38:05.540 --> 38:08.876
at seven knots for two years

38:08.877 --> 38:10.277
before refueling.

38:10.278 --> 38:11.245
And you know why?

38:11.246 --> 38:14.348
Because it runs on nuclear power.

38:14.349 --> 38:17.451
We let a transformative,

38:17.452 --> 38:19.987
carbon-free technology

38:19.988 --> 38:22.790
get buried in fear

38:22.791 --> 38:24.925
and ignorance.

38:24.926 --> 38:28.729
And now we're suffering
the consequences.

38:28.730 --> 38:33.834
It doesn't have the clarity
of battle lines on a map,

38:33.835 --> 38:38.539
but climate change is the
existential threat of our time.

38:38.540 --> 38:43.978
And we have to do more
than provide moral leadership.

38:43.979 --> 38:46.947
You want to revisit
our nuclear energy policy.

38:46.948 --> 38:48.182
I do.

38:48.183 --> 38:51.118
And I know exactly where to start.

38:51.119 --> 38:53.554
The CDF is still worried
about the threat of a meltdown.

38:53.555 --> 38:55.356
JAY: That threat has
always been way overblown,

38:55.357 --> 38:56.390
if nonexistent.

38:56.391 --> 38:57.922
And barring some technical moon shot,

38:57.923 --> 39:00.127
which isn't going to happen,
we are not getting

39:00.128 --> 39:03.731
to 100% renewables
before the ice caps are gone.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.199
Between us,

39:05.200 --> 39:08.269
I get that modern nuclear plants

39:08.270 --> 39:11.605
using light-water reactors
are virtually accident-proof.

39:11.606 --> 39:14.642
Then what's with all the "bathe
the planet in radiation" stuff?

39:14.643 --> 39:15.643
Official party lines.

39:15.644 --> 39:16.911
Our members,

39:16.912 --> 39:18.512
they think any support of nuclear

39:18.513 --> 39:21.148
- takes money away from renewables.
- So educate them.

39:21.149 --> 39:22.699
It's not that simple. I need
to think about my donor base.

39:22.700 --> 39:25.086
Actually, it is.

39:25.087 --> 39:27.521
I need to fight global warming,

39:27.522 --> 39:29.356
and I cannot do that without them.

39:29.357 --> 39:31.125
You can't win that fight
without nuclear power.

39:31.126 --> 39:32.426
ELIZABETH: And we can't sell

39:32.427 --> 39:34.028
the public without you.

39:34.029 --> 39:36.497
So sponsor our pavilion
at the World Expo.

39:36.498 --> 39:37.998
BLAKE: Admittedly,

39:37.999 --> 39:39.266
it's a stripped-down version.

39:39.267 --> 39:40.601
ELIZABETH: But one that will showcase

39:40.602 --> 39:42.269
a future where carbon-based fuels

39:42.270 --> 39:45.038
are actually a thing of the past.

39:45.806 --> 39:47.807
(SIGHS)

39:48.509 --> 39:50.344
HENRY: <i>Lieutenant Hill was raised</i>

39:50.345 --> 39:52.046
to join the family business.

39:52.047 --> 39:54.648
He loves flying. He loves flying

39:54.649 --> 39:57.785
more than anything in the world,

39:57.786 --> 40:00.054
and he would never
willingly give it up

40:00.055 --> 40:01.822
unless he had no choice.

40:01.823 --> 40:04.458
He never wanted to be a
conscientious objector.

40:04.459 --> 40:06.560
He wanted to be a fighter pilot.

40:06.561 --> 40:08.762
But he knows that

40:08.763 --> 40:10.564
his participation
in the death of others

40:10.565 --> 40:12.967
would leave him with a
guilt he couldn't bear,

40:12.968 --> 40:16.437
a-a moral wound from which
he would never recover.

40:16.438 --> 40:17.972
He's heartbroken that he let down

40:17.973 --> 40:21.876
his commanding officers
and his loved ones, but...

40:21.877 --> 40:23.310
he is determined to serve this country

40:23.311 --> 40:24.545
in ways outside the military,

40:24.546 --> 40:26.614
and I have every confidence
he'll find a way

40:26.615 --> 40:27.915
to do that.

40:27.916 --> 40:30.050
I believe that Lieutenant Hill's

40:30.051 --> 40:31.719
motives are pure,

40:31.720 --> 40:34.522
and I support his application

40:34.523 --> 40:36.624
for conscientious objector status.

40:36.625 --> 40:39.226
Thank you, Dr. McCord.

40:39.227 --> 40:41.527
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

40:55.075 --> 40:56.810
Hey.

40:56.811 --> 40:59.280
- Hi.
- Where is everyone?

40:59.281 --> 41:03.017
Mom wanted to have dinner
at, uh, Mazzarella's

41:03.018 --> 41:06.587
to celebrate her new partnership
with the Climate Defense Force.

41:06.588 --> 41:08.455
<i>Viva la nuclear.</i>

41:08.456 --> 41:10.157
Ah, indeed.

41:10.158 --> 41:12.726
- Ali is taking one for the team.
- Mm.

41:12.727 --> 41:15.829
And I got out of it
by playing the work card.

41:15.830 --> 41:17.598
As you can see.

41:17.599 --> 41:19.433
I thought you were having
dinner at Piper's.

41:19.434 --> 41:21.401
I did, too.

41:22.469 --> 41:24.471
What happened?

41:24.472 --> 41:26.640
Um...

41:26.641 --> 41:28.941
she broke up with me.

41:30.211 --> 41:32.512
What?

41:33.214 --> 41:36.083
Jason.

41:36.084 --> 41:38.719
I'm so sorry.

41:38.720 --> 41:41.055
I just...

41:41.056 --> 41:42.189
(SIGHS)

41:42.190 --> 41:43.357
I just don't get it, you know?

41:43.358 --> 41:44.925
Like... (SIGHS)

41:44.926 --> 41:47.928
last week she wanted to take our
relationship to the next level

41:47.929 --> 41:49.395
and now she's ending it?

41:50.164 --> 41:51.999
Yeah.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.336
(SIGHS) I mean...

41:55.337 --> 41:59.873
I don't know...
if-if relationships made sense,

41:59.874 --> 42:03.444
I would've been married,
like, three times by now.

42:03.445 --> 42:05.746
That doesn't make any sense.

42:05.747 --> 42:08.349
Exactly.

42:08.350 --> 42:10.351
Aw.

42:10.352 --> 42:12.353
God.

42:20.929 --> 42:23.564
How do I make the pain go away?

42:23.565 --> 42:26.566
You kinda don't.

42:27.635 --> 42:30.371
You just got to wallow in it

42:30.372 --> 42:33.706
for as long as it takes.

Well, this sucks.
