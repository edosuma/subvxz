Yeah. Exactly.

02:08.965 --> 02:11.655
I feel like
me losing this ring

was like
the  spirits

02:13.310 --> 02:14.896
were telling me
to  leave.

but you found it.

02:51.482 --> 02:54.344
It's not the end of the world.

05:39.655 --> 05:41.068

know about it,

05:41.137 --> 05:44.000
and they put me on
medication because of it,

05:44.068 --> 05:45.689
'cause I, like,
couldn't handle life,

05:45.758 --> 05:48.379

like, it was like Xanax,

going through, like...

06:05.137 --> 06:06.931

Yeah, I was,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.413
and I didn't want to admit it
to people at that time period.

06:09.482 --> 06:12.068
Yeah.
And then I had
a really good idea

06:12.137 --> 06:14.068
to bang my head
against the wall.

06:14.137 --> 06:16.758
I didn't realize
the wall was cement.

06:16.827 --> 06:18.689

You have no idea.

06:18.758 --> 06:20.689

36:45.517 --> 36:48.000
would not want me to hang out
with Ron or sit next to him.

36:48.068 --> 36:49.896
This is coming
from Nicole's insecurities

36:49.965 --> 36:52.655
of living with someone that she
cheated on her husband with,

36:52.724 --> 36:54.517
before he was
her husband years ago.

36:54.586 --> 36:56.103
I'm gonna go up there.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.517
Own it. Literally say, dude,
I  up so bad with you,

36:58.586 --> 37:02.827
Vinny, so if you would be so
kind as to not go near me

37:02.896 --> 37:06.068
when we're out, I would
greatly appreciate it. Boom!

37:07.344 --> 37:09.344
Listen, I get both sides.

37:09.413 --> 37:12.586
I don't want to talk about it,
annoying.  off!

37:12.655 --> 37:14.482
Even if you continue
talking about it,

37:14.551 --> 37:15.862
there should be set rules.

37:15.931 --> 37:17.344
There shouldn't even
be a  rule.

37:17.413 --> 37:18.965
We're all friends.He's making it.

37:19.034 --> 37:21.034
But you're edging it on.
You're egging it on.

37:21.103 --> 37:23.862
I'm not. I said, "set
your  boundaries."

37:23.931 --> 37:25.586
Respect my husband, Jenni!

37:25.655 --> 37:28.931
But he said that you
keep saying to him,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.620
"don't stand near me,"
so don't say that to him!

37:31.689 --> 37:34.034
Cool. It's my fault. Go be
on his side. Thank you.

37:34.103 --> 37:35.689
Okay, fine. We're done.

37:35.758 --> 37:38.517
Thanks for being a good
friend, idiot. Annoying.

37:38.586 --> 37:41.448
Don't  call me an idiot
and don't  say that,

37:41.517 --> 37:44.103
because when you say you're
done, be  done!

37:44.172 --> 37:46.517
Be  done, though.
Be done.

37:46.586 --> 37:48.000
Don't , when
I'm walking away, say...

37:48.068 --> 37:50.344
I'm not speaking
to you, JWoww.

37:51.724 --> 37:53.379
She's out of control.Shh!

37:53.448 --> 37:55.689
Shh!
Yeah, she's out of control.

37:55.758 --> 37:57.310
Don't  say that I'm
an idiot when I'm walking away.

37:57.379 --> 37:58.689
You are an idiot!

37:58.758 --> 38:01.344
I'm respecting you,
don't  say that

38:01.413 --> 38:02.448
when I'm walking
the  away.

38:02.517 --> 38:03.517
Shh! Shut up.

38:03.586 --> 38:04.724
It's  crazy.

38:04.793 --> 38:06.758
It's crazy.

38:06.827 --> 38:12.206
I have no idea
what's going on.

38:12.275 --> 38:17.827
Uh... uh... eh... ooh...

38:17.896 --> 38:21.931
Like, it really, it is crazy.
It's crazy.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And where the
did all my drinks go?

38:25.862 --> 38:28.827
When I'm walking away,
I'm respecting you.

38:28.896 --> 38:31.931
Don't  say that when
I'm walking the  away,

38:32.000 --> 38:33.103
'cause I'm not gonna
tolerate that ,

38:33.172 --> 38:34.827
because I am a
really good friend.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.862
So, when I'm walking
the  away

38:36.931 --> 38:40.103
and say "we're  done,"
don't  call me an idiot!

38:40.172 --> 38:41.448
Don't raise
your voice at me.

38:41.517 --> 38:43.034
Who the
do you think you are?

38:43.103 --> 38:44.344
We're done.
We're done with it.

38:44.413 --> 38:45.448
You're annoying.

38:45.517 --> 38:47.379
You're the best friend ever.
Thank you.

38:47.448 --> 38:48.689
!

38:48.758 --> 38:50.931
I can't even sit
in a cab by accident...

38:51.000 --> 38:53.068
I understand....without this girl going,

38:53.137 --> 38:55.758
"oh, no, we need
to change positions."

38:55.827 --> 38:56.896
Well, she just
blamed me. I'm out.

38:56.965 --> 38:59.068
I hear you, you annoying!

38:59.137 --> 39:01.448
I don't want to try and ruin
this girl's marriage.

39:01.517 --> 39:03.724
I have a girlfriend.I know.

39:03.793 --> 39:05.275
No one's trying to ruin
this girl's marriage.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.586
Exactly! I just said,
be  real.

39:07.655 --> 39:08.655
She calls me a  idiot.

39:08.724 --> 39:10.172
I don't deserve
to be ragged on...

39:10.241 --> 39:13.275
Oh, my God! You're being so
dramatic! Shut up!

39:13.344 --> 39:14.517
I'm not  dramatic,
Nicole!

39:14.586 --> 39:16.103
All because I called
you an idiot!

39:16.172 --> 39:17.758
What, you've never been
called an idiot before?

39:17.827 --> 39:19.103
Oh, my God! I started...
I started another fight.

39:19.172 --> 39:20.172
You've never been called

39:20.241 --> 39:21.275
a  idiot before?

39:21.344 --> 39:22.689
Calm down, Jenni!

39:22.758 --> 39:24.965
Don't
call me an idiot.

39:25.034 --> 39:26.689
I know, but that's
how she is.

39:26.758 --> 39:28.172
I know, but I'm tired of it.

39:28.241 --> 39:30.482
I've been dealing with it
for nine  years.

39:30.551 --> 39:34.241
Bitch, I have a  family!
Shut up, you  idiot!

39:34.310 --> 39:36.137
Jenni, don't fight with her.

39:36.206 --> 39:38.448
Really, bitch
Bring it on.

39:38.517 --> 39:40.827
I'm tired of being called
a  worst best friend

39:40.896 --> 39:42.448
when I'm actually
sticking up for you.

39:42.517 --> 39:44.413
You  dramatic bitch!

39:44.482 --> 39:47.000
Bitch, don't go there.
Don't  go there.

39:47.068 --> 39:49.206
I'm upset here!

39:49.275 --> 39:52.344
I am so happy
that this time in Miami,

39:52.413 --> 39:55.275
I am not the center
of all the drama.

39:55.344 --> 39:57.241
You're the worst! You're,
like, not a good friend!

39:57.310 --> 39:58.586
You're the worst!Own your , Nicole.

39:58.655 --> 39:59.827
Own your ,
Nicole.What ?

39:59.896 --> 40:01.655
Say to him, "I just
broke up with you,

40:01.724 --> 40:03.206
so I can't be around you."

40:03.275 --> 40:05.344
You're literally bringing
that up now?
Being an adult.

40:05.413 --> 40:07.448
You're ruining
my  marriage!

40:07.517 --> 40:08.689
Jesus, you're the worst!

40:08.758 --> 40:10.793
No, I'm not ruining
, Nicole.

40:10.862 --> 40:13.724
Be  real.
Holy !

40:13.793 --> 40:17.413
I cannot believe
she's bringing that up!

40:17.482 --> 40:19.413
Holy  estrogen!
