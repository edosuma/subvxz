00:27.546 --> 00:28.411
Morning.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.369
Good morning, Officer Winks.

00:31.149 --> 00:32.782
Punctual as ever, Officer Rose.

00:32.810 --> 00:35.811
Oh-ho. Look at that... new smart watch.

00:35.813 --> 00:37.079
Looking good.

00:37.081 --> 00:38.134
Thank you.

00:38.649 --> 00:40.449
Hi.

00:50.828 --> 00:53.629
Hey. So, Deb get you that watch?

00:55.699 --> 00:56.863
It was my idea, actually.

00:56.888 --> 00:57.666
Oh, yeah?

00:57.668 --> 00:59.468
What's it do,
time contractions or something?

00:59.470 --> 01:01.837
Got the baby bag packed and ready to go.

01:01.839 --> 01:04.138
How many times you driven
the route to the hospital?

01:04.141 --> 01:05.474
Like 10.

01:08.445 --> 01:11.246
Nothing good ever comes in life
unless you work at it, Ange.

01:11.248 --> 01:12.981
You're gonna be the best dad.

01:16.587 --> 01:18.520
Hey, who are those guys
with Mr. Winston?

01:20.190 --> 01:22.936
Oh, the I.T. servers
went down last night.

01:24.628 --> 01:26.695
No, I.T. guys aren't due until 3:00.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.630
- So they're early.
- No, Bill, they're never early.

01:28.632 --> 01:30.554
And I haven't seen those guys before.

01:32.209 --> 01:33.754
All right, I'll check it out.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.552
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:51.989 --> 01:53.855
May I see your identification, please?

01:53.857 --> 01:57.125
Is there a problem... officer?

01:58.373 --> 02:00.996
I'm sorry. We left them in the van.

02:02.299 --> 02:04.800
You mind if I take a quick look
in your bag?

02:08.038 --> 02:10.172
I don't think so.

02:18.515 --> 02:20.048
Oh, no.

02:32.663 --> 02:33.862
Emergency response.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.931
This is Officer Angela Rose,

02:35.933 --> 02:39.334
Bailey Merchants Bank, 831647th Street.

02:41.138 --> 02:43.639
Everybody out of your offices now!

02:43.641 --> 02:44.766
Let's go!

02:45.175 --> 02:46.642
- On the floor.
- Ohh!

02:46.644 --> 02:48.210
I have two armed men.

02:48.212 --> 02:50.045
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Okay! Come on!

02:50.047 --> 02:51.780
- Drop that phone now!
- Let's go. Come on!

02:51.782 --> 02:52.881
12 hostages.

02:52.883 --> 02:54.483
Police units are on their way.

02:54.485 --> 02:56.518
- Cellphones.
- Cellphones!

02:56.520 --> 02:57.853
- Cellphones.
- All of them.

02:57.855 --> 02:59.579
Don't leave any behind.

02:59.923 --> 03:02.157
- Hurry. Go, go, go, go.
- All of them.

03:02.159 --> 03:04.760
- Let's go.
- Here! Here!

03:14.304 --> 03:15.704
We're gonna do...

03:15.706 --> 03:18.073
Back. Back. Back!

03:18.075 --> 03:19.107
Okay, okay, okay! Shut your mouth.

03:19.109 --> 03:20.275
- Okay, okay.
- Shut your mouth.

03:20.277 --> 03:22.344
Drop your weapon!

03:29.553 --> 03:30.986
The police are on their way,

03:31.246 --> 03:35.490
so leave now before...
while you still have the chance!

03:39.697 --> 03:41.063
Aah!

03:41.065 --> 03:43.031
Ow!

03:50.107 --> 03:52.841
You drop your weapon now, rent-a-cop,

03:52.843 --> 03:54.776
or the next one's in his head.

04:54.953 --> 04:56.052
Let them through. Let them through here.

04:56.054 --> 04:56.886
Sit rep.

04:56.888 --> 04:58.388
Building's been evacuated.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.556
We're looking at two hostage takers,

05:00.558 --> 05:01.924
14 hostages,

05:01.926 --> 05:04.594
including two security guards,
one gravely injured.

05:05.446 --> 05:07.330
- I'll grab the equipment.
- Okay.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.969
You're back. Yay.

05:13.969 --> 05:15.838
So happy.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.141
Eric knew who my mother was.

05:19.046 --> 05:20.934
He knew all along.

05:20.936 --> 05:23.112
If he's okay with me being here,
then you should be, too.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.847
Not that simple, Ms. Carlson.

05:25.651 --> 05:27.283
Have at it.

05:31.222 --> 05:33.823
The bank made an urgent call
for I.T. last night

05:33.825 --> 05:35.158
due to a loss of service.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.593
Disrupt service overnight
so they can gain entry

05:37.595 --> 05:39.262
as I.T. engineers in the morning...

05:39.264 --> 05:40.530
they're professionals.

05:40.532 --> 05:42.999
Professionals don't want to be
surrounded by the police.

05:43.001 --> 05:44.200
They should have anticipated

05:44.202 --> 05:46.035
someone would have activated the alarm.

05:46.037 --> 05:47.403
Well, maybe they did.

05:51.378 --> 05:52.675
Who triggered the alarm?

05:52.677 --> 05:56.101
Angela Rose, one of the private
security guards.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.867
What are the hostage takers asking for?

05:58.869 --> 05:59.816
Nothing so far.

05:59.818 --> 06:03.619
Hostage takers with no
demands... that's different.

06:04.254 --> 06:05.688
Not so different.

06:06.386 --> 06:08.291
San Francisco, January 2005,

06:08.293 --> 06:10.593
we had a similar situation.
And Rome, November 2011.

06:11.999 --> 06:13.629
Sharp, little memory
you got there, Ms. Denard.

06:13.631 --> 06:15.231
Ah, the better to keep you

06:15.233 --> 06:17.919
from pulling the wool
over my eyes, Mr. Beaumont.

06:19.465 --> 06:21.938
Hi. I'm Maxine Carlson.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.306
Nathalie Denard.

06:23.308 --> 06:25.541
- Ah. Your company insures the bank.
- That's right.

06:25.543 --> 06:27.243
We resolve kidnap and hostage situations

06:27.245 --> 06:29.078
for Ms. Denard's clients
all over the world.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.080
Which means we see a lot of each other.

06:31.082 --> 06:32.915
Mm, too much, actually.

06:35.059 --> 06:37.019
Is someone from the bank here?

06:37.021 --> 06:39.255
Elizabeth Bloom,
chief of the board of directors.

06:39.257 --> 06:40.423
Would you like to meet her?

06:40.425 --> 06:42.158
Oh, I'd be delighted, yeah.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.426
Follow me.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.598
You're allowed to come.

06:51.466 --> 06:52.378
Is this her?

06:52.380 --> 06:53.884
Move that appointment
to later this afternoon.

06:53.886 --> 06:56.114
Ms. Bloom, this is Eric Beaumont.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.540
- Beaumont.
- Hey.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.041
- Your reputation precedes you.
- Thank you.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.076
This is Zara Hallam,

07:00.078 --> 07:01.944
formerly NYPD
and our chief investigator.

07:01.946 --> 07:02.879
Investigator?

07:02.881 --> 07:05.181
I thought you were negotiators.

07:05.183 --> 07:07.483
Information's vital to a negotiation.

07:07.485 --> 07:09.452
Zara makes sure we have
a full command of the facts.

07:09.454 --> 07:11.420
I'm Oliver Yates, a psychologist.

07:11.422 --> 07:13.222
I profile the hostage takers.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.158
And I'm Maxine Carlson, the bugger.

07:16.043 --> 07:16.792
Bugger?

07:16.794 --> 07:17.894
Maxine's in training.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.096
I ask her to second-guess
all my decisions

07:20.098 --> 07:21.764
so she can learn to bug me.

07:21.766 --> 07:22.965
She's a natural.

07:22.967 --> 07:24.700
Mr. Beaumont, we have to resolve this

07:24.702 --> 07:25.868
as quickly as possible.

07:26.337 --> 07:28.671
Our policy provides
for a $10 million payout.

07:28.673 --> 07:30.907
I don't expect we'll pay
that much, Ms. Bloom.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.476
Avoiding violence is our
top priority, Ms. Bloom.

07:33.478 --> 07:36.078
And saving her company money.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.080
Well, at the moment,
the hostage takers haven't asked

07:38.082 --> 07:39.175
for anything at all.

07:39.177 --> 07:40.550
So, what do they want?

07:40.552 --> 07:42.084
That's what we need to find out.

07:42.086 --> 07:42.952
Will you excuse us?

07:46.741 --> 07:48.424
Don't worry. He knows what he's doing.

07:49.029 --> 07:50.893
He better.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.803
That bad, huh?

08:03.182 --> 08:04.455
Angie.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.409
Don't.

08:12.799 --> 08:14.607
You cut the camera feed?

08:15.119 --> 08:16.986
Yeah, I did.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.486
I thought I said, “Don't shoot anyone”"

08:25.296 --> 08:27.296
- I know what I'm doing.
- Ah.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.477
I was just making sure
nobody tries nothing.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.836
These hostages were to make sure
the cops don't come in.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.905
Now you've pretty well guaranteed

08:35.907 --> 08:37.039
a SWAT team on our backs.

08:37.041 --> 08:38.808
You just set up the insurance.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.600
SWAT looks a little lively for my taste.

09:04.602 --> 09:06.669
- Yeah, we'll find out about that.
- Don't worry.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.803
You ask.

09:08.806 --> 09:09.839
Sellars!

09:10.775 --> 09:12.975
Zara Hallam.

09:12.977 --> 09:14.110
How are Mike and the kids?

09:14.112 --> 09:15.911
Oh, good! Or so I'm told.

09:15.913 --> 09:18.147
Oh, I hear that.

09:18.149 --> 09:20.549
Eric Beaumont, Commander Nina Sellars,

09:20.551 --> 09:21.851
an old friend of mine.

09:21.853 --> 09:22.718
Pleasure.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.674
It's an honor, Mr. Beaumont,

09:23.676 --> 09:25.655
but I'm afraid there isn't much
for you to do here.

09:25.657 --> 09:27.757
You still haven't made contact
with the hostage takers.

09:27.759 --> 09:28.557
Zip.

09:28.559 --> 09:29.625
And I've got every news crew

09:29.627 --> 09:31.093
on the Eastern seaboard parked outside,

09:31.095 --> 09:33.729
plus the Mayor's demanding
updates every 15 minutes, so...

09:33.731 --> 09:35.164
Have you identified them?

09:36.457 --> 09:37.281
This is your show, Commander.

09:37.283 --> 09:38.968
I'm just here to help in any way I can.

09:40.244 --> 09:41.370
Sure.

09:44.108 --> 09:46.142
Zachary Smith, 32,

09:46.144 --> 09:48.944
served six years
for the Brooklyn West heist.

09:48.946 --> 09:50.613
Six years.

09:50.615 --> 09:52.982
Four bank tellers
were executed in cold blood.

09:52.984 --> 09:54.216
Yeah, his accomplice took the fall,

09:54.218 --> 09:55.484
but we think he was just
following Smith's orders...

09:55.486 --> 09:56.984
a nasty piece of work.

09:56.986 --> 09:58.287
And what about the second man?

09:58.289 --> 09:59.355
Theodore Grimes...

10:00.011 --> 10:01.490
formerly one of New York's finest.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.959
He served four years for taking bribes

10:03.961 --> 10:05.594
from a meth dealer in Castle Hill.

10:05.596 --> 10:07.547
Okay, so robbing banks
during business hours

10:07.549 --> 10:08.864
isn't exactly Grimes' M.O.

10:08.866 --> 10:09.832
No, but it is Smith's,

10:09.834 --> 10:11.334
and they spent 18 months together

10:11.336 --> 10:12.835
in the same cell block in Attica.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.937
We saw SWAT outside.

10:14.939 --> 10:17.340
We can't bypass the alarms
on the windows and doors,

10:17.342 --> 10:20.042
but they found access
through a vent in the basement.

10:20.044 --> 10:21.210
Take it from me...

10:21.212 --> 10:23.579
you got a homicidal ex-con
in there, detective.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.247
SWAT charges in, someone's bound to die.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.149
Someone's bound to die if they don't.

10:27.151 --> 10:28.244
Bob?

10:28.786 --> 10:29.885
This was three hours ago,

10:29.887 --> 10:31.687
right before they cut the CCTV feeds.

10:32.914 --> 10:35.725
<i> Aah!</i>

10:35.727 --> 10:36.926
Victim's Bill Winks.

10:37.254 --> 10:38.997
His wife's eight months pregnant.

10:39.731 --> 10:42.064
Mr. Beaumont, I would be happy
to let you negotiate,

10:42.066 --> 10:44.367
but these guys don't even want to talk,

10:44.369 --> 10:45.935
and this man can't afford to wait.

10:47.004 --> 10:49.338
It's the Mayor again. Excuse me.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.140
You mind sharing
this footage with my team?

10:51.142 --> 10:52.508
Knock yourself out.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sit down!

10:58.182 --> 10:59.281
- Sit down!
- Sorry, sorry.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.516
Just... Just... Please, just...

11:00.518 --> 11:03.319
Just... He's real bad.

11:04.003 --> 11:05.154
So he dies.

11:06.557 --> 11:09.558
There's a... There's a medi-kit
in that desk right there.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.529
If I could just bandage him up,
I could stop the bleeding.

11:14.766 --> 11:16.198
Let her help him.

11:36.209 --> 11:37.887
Don't do nothing stupid.

11:40.525 --> 11:44.260
A convicted murderer
and a disgraced ex-cop...

11:44.285 --> 11:45.995
talk about an odd couple.

11:45.997 --> 11:46.896
Profiles?

11:46.898 --> 11:48.898
Smith is your textbook sociopath,

11:48.900 --> 11:51.233
which suggests that our ex-cop Grimes

11:51.235 --> 11:52.568
is the decision-maker.

11:52.570 --> 11:53.636
I think you were right.

11:53.638 --> 11:55.371
This must have been his plan all along.

11:55.373 --> 11:57.373
Locking himself in the bank
with the whole world watching

11:57.375 --> 11:58.908
doesn't sound like much of a plan.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.509
Well, if you're not willing
to negotiate,

12:00.511 --> 12:02.111
he must feel
he's in a position of power.

12:02.113 --> 12:04.480
But why take the hostages
if he didn't want something?

12:04.482 --> 12:06.015
The question is what.

12:06.863 --> 12:09.251
They're in a bank.
The answer is obvious, isn't it?

12:09.253 --> 12:11.620
Money's not much good
if they can't get it out.

12:12.016 --> 12:13.422
Hostages buy them time.

12:13.924 --> 12:15.424
Shooting one doesn't.

12:15.426 --> 12:17.092
Yeah, I don't think
that was part of the plan.

12:17.094 --> 12:19.295
Erratic behavior does befit a sociopath.

12:19.297 --> 12:20.796
We need to establish contact.

12:20.798 --> 12:22.731
- How?
- They won't answer the phone,

12:22.733 --> 12:25.234
and they'll have confiscated
the hostages' cellphones.

12:25.236 --> 12:26.535
Well, I suggest we hurry,

12:26.537 --> 12:27.903
because one of these guys

12:27.905 --> 12:30.172
has a long history of violent behavior.

12:30.174 --> 12:32.107
But not their smart watches.

12:32.691 --> 12:34.176
I noticed in the video...

12:34.178 --> 12:35.911
that security guard who was shot,

12:35.913 --> 12:37.279
he's wearing a smart watch.

12:42.153 --> 12:44.753
But Nina would have put
a cellphone jammer in place.

12:44.755 --> 12:47.356
That's what stops hostage takers
from making outside calls.

12:47.358 --> 12:48.491
I know what a jammer is.

12:48.493 --> 12:50.292
A smart watch would be tethered
to a cellphone,

12:50.294 --> 12:51.694
so its signal would be blocked, too.

12:51.696 --> 12:52.862
Not necessarily.

12:53.224 --> 12:55.214
They operate on different frequencies.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.969
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.843
It's awful tight.

13:07.845 --> 13:10.212
Yeah, that's the idea.

13:11.474 --> 13:12.481
Hands.

13:12.483 --> 13:13.749
I've got to do this.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.684
Now. Come on. Come on.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.824
On the ground. Get on the ground.

13:39.149 --> 13:40.682
What are they doing in there?

13:43.014 --> 13:45.247
Drilling.

13:45.249 --> 13:47.516
Commander.

13:47.518 --> 13:48.651
I think we can establish contact

13:48.653 --> 13:49.985
with the wounded guard's smart watch.

13:49.987 --> 13:51.253
I'm sorry Mr. Beaumont.

13:51.255 --> 13:52.555
It's too late. SWAT's in position.

13:52.557 --> 13:55.257
They're going in through
that vent in the basement now.

13:57.130 --> 13:59.328
Stay back, please. Thank you.

14:24.112 --> 14:25.421
Hey.

14:26.749 --> 14:29.158
I'm getting a pairing request
on my watch.

14:32.463 --> 14:33.988
Let me see that.

14:50.114 --> 14:52.414
_

14:53.890 --> 14:56.354
_

14:56.384 --> 14:57.486
What's it say?

14:57.488 --> 14:59.722
His name's Eric.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.690
He's a negotiator.

15:10.434 --> 15:12.334
Does this thing have voice recognition?

15:12.336 --> 15:13.435
Yeah, sure.

15:13.437 --> 15:16.095
Just tap the microphone button.

15:17.408 --> 15:19.642
They're drilling in the vault.

15:22.007 --> 15:24.013
But one of them
was in the basement before.

15:27.095 --> 15:29.095
_

15:31.960 --> 15:35.758
I don't know, but he had
a bag and some wire.

16:16.033 --> 16:17.866
Monkey never learns.

16:22.890 --> 16:24.724
I need people in here
as fast as you can. Let's go!

16:24.726 --> 16:25.725
Move it!

16:27.195 --> 16:28.228
Eric!

16:30.232 --> 16:31.731
How you feeling?

16:31.733 --> 16:33.433
Like I was at an AC/DC concert.

16:33.435 --> 16:35.735
I don't understand how you knew
that that was rigged.

16:35.737 --> 16:39.306
Personal area networks operate
at 2.4 to 2.485 gigahertz,

16:39.308 --> 16:41.608
well above the cellphone
frequency you were jamming.

16:41.610 --> 16:43.292
I was able to pair my phone

16:43.294 --> 16:44.711
with the injured guard's smart watch,

16:44.713 --> 16:47.247
and I found out they set
some wire in the basement.

16:47.249 --> 16:48.481
Thank God for that.

16:48.483 --> 16:50.083
Those men would be dead if you hadn't.

16:50.085 --> 16:51.284
Well, they're not, Commander,

16:51.286 --> 16:52.953
and now we may be able
to save the other lives.

16:52.955 --> 16:54.621
But Smith and Grimes
have made it pretty clear

16:54.623 --> 16:55.755
they don't want to talk to us.

16:55.757 --> 16:57.123
Well, we don't need to talk to them.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.025
Angela Rose,
that security guard... she can.

16:59.027 --> 17:00.160
She's hardly a negotiator.

17:00.162 --> 17:01.761
Eric can coach her on what to say, Nina.

17:01.763 --> 17:03.096
Right, but I need to talk to her.

17:03.098 --> 17:05.231
I need you to lift that jammer
just long enough

17:05.233 --> 17:06.800
to establish a dedicated signal.

17:06.801 --> 17:09.269
I do that, and all the hostage's
cellphones start jangling

17:09.271 --> 17:10.904
with messages from worried loved ones.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.237
They'll know we're up to something.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.374
Angela said
they're drilling in the vault.

17:14.376 --> 17:16.462
They might not hear the ringing
if we do it quickly enough.

17:16.464 --> 17:17.396
Drilling for what?

17:17.397 --> 17:18.888
That I don't know.

17:18.891 --> 17:20.884
It's the Mayor again.

17:20.886 --> 17:22.214
Excuse me.

17:22.777 --> 17:24.636
- Get her to lift that jammer.
- Yeah.

17:24.637 --> 17:25.551
We need that dedicated signal.

17:27.983 --> 17:31.091
Okay, what do we know about
the security guard, Angela Rose?

17:32.210 --> 17:35.569
Well, at 8 years old,
she lost her mother to cancer.

17:35.796 --> 17:38.197
Father was a cop, died last year.

17:38.199 --> 17:41.133
Graduated from City College
with a B.A. in English.

17:41.135 --> 17:42.434
Unmarried, two dogs.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.002
How long has she been a security guard?

17:44.004 --> 17:45.048
Three years.

17:45.050 --> 17:46.155
She trained to be a cop,

17:46.157 --> 17:48.394
but dropped out of the police
academy after six months.

17:48.396 --> 17:49.475
Because?

17:49.477 --> 17:51.731
It doesn't say, but for three years,

17:51.733 --> 17:53.946
this woman has been locked
in a dark room

17:53.948 --> 17:55.681
staring at TV monitors.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.651
My guess... not a people person.

17:57.925 --> 18:00.025
Why the sudden interest in Ms. Rose?

18:00.027 --> 18:02.194
Well, we can't talk
to the hostage takers,

18:02.196 --> 18:03.228
but she can.

18:03.230 --> 18:06.532
I see. And you're happy with this plan?

18:06.534 --> 18:09.168
Well, Bill Winks has a matter of
hours until he bleeds to death,

18:09.170 --> 18:11.203
and there's a bunch
of innocent people locked inside

18:11.205 --> 18:12.972
with a known hostage-executing
psychopath.

18:12.974 --> 18:16.041
I mean, given that it's a plan
that we have right now,

18:16.043 --> 18:18.277
I'd say, yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.

18:18.858 --> 18:20.279
Just checking.

18:20.281 --> 18:21.113
Okay.

18:23.713 --> 18:25.085
Jammer's coming down.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.863
All right, let's get ready
to make the connection.

18:27.865 --> 18:30.022
She said we're only gonna have
about 20 seconds

18:30.024 --> 18:31.842
before the jammer's back up.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.691
Hey.

18:41.702 --> 18:43.235
Stop! Stop!

18:51.718 --> 18:53.218
Did I hear something?

18:56.177 --> 18:57.549
Did I hear something?!

18:59.279 --> 19:00.812
Nothing at all.

19:07.528 --> 19:08.594
Nothing at all.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.747
No.

19:14.001 --> 19:15.734
Good.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.407
Okay, jammer's back up,

19:21.409 --> 19:25.544
and dedicated signal... established.

19:28.978 --> 19:31.316
Okay.

19:33.421 --> 19:35.521
“Congratulations, Angela.

19:35.523 --> 19:37.656
No one got hurt thanks to you.”

19:44.665 --> 19:46.098
Call me Angie.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.006
The vault where they're
drilling, what's in there?

19:54.008 --> 19:55.574
Safety deposit boxes.

19:55.576 --> 19:57.309
This bank caters to high-end clients,

19:57.311 --> 20:00.399
so we're looking at jewels,
stock certificates, bonds.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.616
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:05.719 --> 20:07.753
Can you ask Ms. Bloom
for a list of all the people

20:07.755 --> 20:09.421
those safety deposit boxes
are rented to?

20:09.423 --> 20:11.623
That's confidential information.

20:11.625 --> 20:14.426
Hey, do you think
there's something going on

20:14.428 --> 20:16.662
between Eric and the insurance lady?

20:17.765 --> 20:20.365
Nathalie and Eric? Nah.

20:20.861 --> 20:22.645
I'll give it a shot.

20:25.339 --> 20:27.172
Maxine, can you go
with Nathalie, please?

20:27.174 --> 20:28.383
Sure.

20:31.212 --> 20:32.511
You're incorrigible.

20:37.651 --> 20:39.040
Still nothing?

20:39.386 --> 20:40.752
You shouldn't be in here.

20:41.008 --> 20:43.222
I say we contact the outside.

20:43.224 --> 20:45.657
Tell them to give us the names
of who own these boxes,

20:45.659 --> 20:46.992
or we shoot a hostage.

20:46.994 --> 20:48.160
No.

20:48.162 --> 20:50.636
Then we'll kill one every hour
till we find it.

20:55.062 --> 20:56.881
We're not here to kill anyone.

20:58.072 --> 20:59.905
Understand?

21:02.009 --> 21:03.717
This better work.

21:12.319 --> 21:14.620
How did you come to work
for Mr. Beaumont?

21:14.622 --> 21:16.722
It's what I've always dreamed of doing.

21:16.724 --> 21:17.789
Being a negotiator?

21:18.152 --> 21:19.558
Saving people.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.693
Although right now,
I'm just trying to keep up.

21:21.695 --> 21:24.429
Eric is every bit
as brilliant as they say.

21:24.431 --> 21:25.864
He has his moments.

21:25.866 --> 21:27.266
Where are you from?

21:27.268 --> 21:28.433
Smalltownsville.

21:28.435 --> 21:30.681
A place called Shiloh
just outside St. Louis.

21:31.172 --> 21:33.932
How long have you been using
Eric as a negotiator?

21:34.475 --> 21:36.341
Oh gosh, it was, um,

21:36.343 --> 21:38.210
two years before our daughter was born,

21:38.235 --> 21:40.812
so... 16 years?

21:41.849 --> 21:42.915
Ms. Bloom!

21:43.447 --> 21:44.950
There you are.

21:44.952 --> 21:46.685
Your assistant said we'd find you here.

21:46.687 --> 21:48.120
What is going on down there?

21:48.122 --> 21:49.288
Eric's established contact

21:49.290 --> 21:51.390
with one of the hostages
inside the bank.

21:51.392 --> 21:53.292
One of the hostages?

21:53.294 --> 21:54.426
A security guard.

21:54.428 --> 21:56.428
He intends to use her
as a proxy negotiator.

21:57.498 --> 21:59.364
That strategy sounds high-risk.

21:59.366 --> 22:01.097
It's the only one available to us.

22:02.002 --> 22:03.268
Taxi!

22:03.270 --> 22:04.703
What can I do to help?

22:04.705 --> 22:06.572
They've determined
the robbers are drilling

22:06.574 --> 22:09.141
the safe-deposit boxes
looking for something.

22:09.143 --> 22:10.342
Oh?

22:10.344 --> 22:13.128
He needs to know who rents those boxes.

22:16.250 --> 22:18.717
Confidentiality and... and discretion

22:18.719 --> 22:20.185
are vital to our clients.

22:21.236 --> 22:23.561
More vital than saving lives?

22:28.162 --> 22:30.153
Let me see what I can do.

22:37.705 --> 22:38.854
What?

22:40.140 --> 22:42.341
She hesitated before she responded.

22:42.343 --> 22:43.375
Yeah.

22:43.377 --> 22:44.910
Her voice broke, right?

22:44.912 --> 22:47.102
I heard it too, but what does it mean?

23:01.079 --> 23:02.170
Hey.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.238
You ever hear the one

23:03.240 --> 23:05.138
about the two guys who stole a calendar?

23:06.143 --> 23:07.742
They each got six months.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.410
Ange?

23:13.499 --> 23:17.519
Thanks, but no more
being the hero, okay?

23:20.091 --> 23:21.523
You gotta get out of here.

23:22.963 --> 23:25.293
Bill, we're both
gonna make it out of here.

23:32.874 --> 23:33.925
Yeah?

23:33.927 --> 23:36.027
Hey, Angie. It's Eric.

23:36.029 --> 23:37.061
Hi, yeah.

23:37.063 --> 23:39.173
I'm gonna need some more of your help.

23:39.934 --> 23:41.032
You think you're up to that?

23:41.034 --> 23:42.433
What kind of help?

23:42.435 --> 23:46.437
I need you to get
one of those men to talk to me.

23:46.439 --> 23:47.939
How am I gonna do that?

23:47.941 --> 23:49.473
Hey, hey.

24:00.019 --> 24:01.018
Okay, hi.

24:01.020 --> 24:02.407
Take a breath.

24:03.389 --> 24:04.989
Look him in the eye.

24:04.991 --> 24:07.158
Make him feel like you're on his side.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.759
But I'm not on their side.

24:09.696 --> 24:11.095
I don't think she's cut out for this.

24:12.287 --> 24:13.527
Okay.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.501
You and me...
we're gonna do this together.

24:17.503 --> 24:18.369
Okay, Angie?

24:19.146 --> 24:20.371
You just need to remember

24:20.373 --> 24:23.507
they wanna get out of there
just like you do.

24:23.509 --> 24:24.475
What?

24:24.477 --> 24:25.943
SWAT found another way into the bank.

24:25.945 --> 24:27.378
Nina's sending them in.

24:27.765 --> 24:31.148
Okay Angie, I'm gonna ask you
to hold on, all right?

24:31.150 --> 24:32.550
I'll be back in a few.

24:33.813 --> 24:35.353
Okay.

24:36.556 --> 24:37.754
I got it.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.826
And they think
collateral damage will be, uh...

24:41.828 --> 24:43.027
I understand you're going in.

24:43.029 --> 24:43.961
Via the subway.

24:43.963 --> 24:45.296
We think we can break through

24:45.298 --> 24:46.564
an old service entrance in the subfloor.

24:46.566 --> 24:47.598
Commander.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.866
I really appreciate your help earlier,

24:48.868 --> 24:50.077
but we got it from here.

24:50.592 --> 24:52.036
You Beaumont?

24:52.338 --> 24:53.170
Yeah.

24:53.172 --> 24:54.472
Hi. Deputy Commissioner Fletcher.

24:54.474 --> 24:57.187
Nice meeting you.
So, what's the problem?

24:58.281 --> 24:59.844
Deputy Commissioner,
we'd like the chance

24:59.846 --> 25:01.545
to at least attempt a negotiation.

25:01.547 --> 25:03.047
I know. Commander Sellars told me.

25:03.049 --> 25:04.281
But you intend to use

25:04.283 --> 25:05.750
a non-trained security guard
to negotiate for you.

25:05.752 --> 25:07.018
I mean, what?

25:07.020 --> 25:08.619
She's already saved the lives
of a number of your men.

25:08.621 --> 25:10.688
If we help her,
I think she can save a lot more,

25:10.690 --> 25:13.281
but not if your men go in guns blazing.

25:20.428 --> 25:22.500
Okay, Beaumont.
Let's see what you can do.

25:22.997 --> 25:24.702
Commissioner, SWAT is standing by,

25:24.704 --> 25:25.770
and we have a wounded man
who needs medical treatment

25:25.772 --> 25:27.238
or he's gonna die.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.707
I'm more than aware of the time
pressure, Commander, thank you.

25:29.709 --> 25:31.809
We'll give Mr. Beaumont one hour.

25:31.811 --> 25:33.677
You tell SWAT to hold their positions.

25:33.679 --> 25:34.845
Go ahead.

25:35.177 --> 25:37.348
- Thank you... both of you.
- You're welcome.

25:45.792 --> 25:47.324
There's your list.

25:47.777 --> 25:48.959
That was fast.

25:48.961 --> 25:50.961
Doesn't say what's in those
safe deposit boxes...

25:50.963 --> 25:52.963
just the names
of everyone who's rented one.

25:52.965 --> 25:54.598
Gracias.

25:56.369 --> 25:57.668
And ha ha, by the way.

25:57.670 --> 25:58.803
Ha ha what?

25:58.805 --> 26:00.504
Not telling me Eric
and Nathalie are a couple.

26:00.506 --> 26:02.173
<i>Were</i> a couple.

26:02.516 --> 26:04.275
They split over a year ago.

26:04.277 --> 26:05.209
Oh, how come?

26:05.211 --> 26:06.944
Why don't you ask him yourself?

26:10.883 --> 26:14.118
Mr. Beaumont, I have a question.

26:17.790 --> 26:20.658
A shift in latency,
rise in the pitch of a voice...

26:20.660 --> 26:23.527
those are signs of discomfort
with the situation, aren't they?

26:23.841 --> 26:25.196
Why do you ask, Ms. Carlson?

26:25.198 --> 26:28.732
Because Ms. Bloom's voice
did both those things

26:28.734 --> 26:30.334
when Ms. Denard asked her
for the list of names.

26:30.336 --> 26:33.737
I noticed it too, but that's not
surprising, is it?

26:33.739 --> 26:35.673
She's under a lot of pressure.

26:36.309 --> 26:38.114
Our ex-cop, Grimes...

26:38.411 --> 26:41.045
he went to prison for taking
bribes from a meth dealer.

26:41.047 --> 26:42.079
That's right.

26:42.081 --> 26:43.814
Is there anything else on his rap sheet?

26:43.816 --> 26:47.485
Uh, got commendations
in '06 and '07, and...

26:47.487 --> 26:48.886
What?

26:48.888 --> 26:50.588
...May 2008,

26:50.590 --> 26:53.057
he shot a 17-year-old kid in the Bronx.

26:53.349 --> 26:54.725
Grimes claimed he was armed,

26:54.727 --> 26:57.128
but the kid's family said
he never even touched a gun.

26:57.130 --> 26:58.696
- Were charges filed?
- No.

26:58.698 --> 27:01.932
The whole case was dismissed
after an internal investigation,

27:01.934 --> 27:04.079
but the stink from it ruined his career.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.373
On it.

27:09.613 --> 27:11.575
- What's the connection?
- Well, maybe nothing.

27:11.577 --> 27:12.643
But if Officer Grimes

27:12.645 --> 27:14.812
is looking for something
more than money,

27:14.814 --> 27:16.080
maybe this is it.

27:16.478 --> 27:17.581
What?

27:19.085 --> 27:20.279
Redemption.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.419
Nina.

27:22.421 --> 27:23.487
Not in the mood, Zara.

27:23.489 --> 27:25.523
Eric is not trying to undercut you.

27:25.525 --> 27:27.124
There's a dying man in there,
and we're waiting for what?

27:27.126 --> 27:28.826
This is me, remember?

27:30.029 --> 27:32.530
We really need your help. Please.

27:32.532 --> 27:35.666
Keep 'em back. Keep 'em back!

27:35.668 --> 27:38.653
We just need the report from
the night Grimes was arrested.

27:39.238 --> 27:40.566
Okay.

27:43.843 --> 27:45.743
You wanted to speak with me.

27:45.745 --> 27:47.178
Different last name,

27:47.180 --> 27:49.580
but Maxine Carlson
is Jessica Ford's daughter.

27:49.582 --> 27:50.881
You do realize that.

27:50.883 --> 27:51.782
She told you.

27:51.784 --> 27:53.083
It wasn't hard to figure out.

27:53.085 --> 27:55.252
She's the right age,
and she said she's from Shiloh.

27:55.254 --> 27:57.154
I advised him not to hire her.

27:57.156 --> 27:58.189
He did it anyway.

27:58.191 --> 28:01.058
- Why?
- Hey, you're asking the wrong man.

28:01.060 --> 28:02.993
But I expect guilt had
something to do with it.

28:02.995 --> 28:04.929
You think Eric can cope with it?

28:06.299 --> 28:07.898
That's what I thought.

28:07.900 --> 28:09.860
He better pray Damien Delaine
doesn't find out.

28:09.862 --> 28:10.701
Why?

28:10.703 --> 28:12.836
Delaine would do anything
to destroy Eric,

28:12.838 --> 28:14.905
and with Jessica Ford's
daughter on the team...

28:14.907 --> 28:16.140
He killed 22 people at Shiloh.

28:16.142 --> 28:17.374
He's never getting out of prison.

28:17.376 --> 28:18.842
He's up for parole next month.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.213
You didn't know that.

28:39.040 --> 28:39.763
Hi.

28:39.765 --> 28:41.265
- Hey, Angie.
- Yeah.

28:41.961 --> 28:43.267
Ready to do this?

28:44.473 --> 28:45.569
If I go talk to them,

28:45.571 --> 28:47.338
they're gonna know
I've been talking to you.

28:47.340 --> 28:50.341
I'm sure your dad told you
that honesty is the best policy.

28:50.343 --> 28:52.276
Not if it gets you killed.

28:52.278 --> 28:54.111
You'll only talk to the older man.

28:54.113 --> 28:55.212
His name is Teddy,

28:55.214 --> 28:56.747
and I don't think he wants
to do any harm.

28:56.749 --> 28:58.448
All they want is to retrieve something

28:58.450 --> 29:00.892
from one of those safety deposit
boxes in the vault.

29:05.293 --> 29:07.024
You know I'm not a real cop, right?

29:07.026 --> 29:09.126
I don't know.
You seem pretty real to me.

29:09.128 --> 29:11.428
I dropped out of the academy
because I get panic attacks.

29:11.430 --> 29:14.798
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid, Angie.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.308
It's what you do
with your fear that matters.

29:19.123 --> 29:20.871
You're a professional negotiator?

29:20.873 --> 29:22.259
I am.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.875
How many cases you negotiated?

29:25.324 --> 29:26.210
Thousands.

29:27.017 --> 29:27.845
You lose any?

29:28.780 --> 29:30.004
One.

29:32.952 --> 29:34.318
That's a pretty good track record.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.720
How do you do it?

29:36.722 --> 29:40.763
I make the right decisions,
like believing in you.

29:44.697 --> 29:47.064
Come on. Come on!

29:47.066 --> 29:49.199
Stay cool!

29:49.201 --> 29:50.901
Go back and guard the hostages.

29:50.903 --> 29:51.802
We will find it.

29:51.804 --> 29:53.003
When?!

29:53.005 --> 29:54.915
You see how many boxes are in here?

29:57.738 --> 29:59.209
Excu... Excuse me.

29:59.211 --> 30:00.277
What the hell are you doing?

30:00.279 --> 30:01.412
I'm just... I want to help you.

30:01.414 --> 30:03.080
And how are you gonna help us, bitch?

30:03.082 --> 30:04.553
Huh? Huh?

30:06.660 --> 30:07.651
Come on, Angie.

30:08.529 --> 30:10.587
I can help you find
what you're looking for.

30:11.241 --> 30:12.489
How?

30:18.369 --> 30:19.330
Pick it up.

30:19.332 --> 30:20.998
Just pick it up.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.666
He'll tell you where to find it.

30:22.668 --> 30:23.767
How do you know that, huh?

30:23.769 --> 30:25.336
Unless you've been talking
to the cops, huh?

30:25.338 --> 30:26.537
- You been talking to...
- Hey!

30:27.068 --> 30:28.005
You're scaring her.

30:28.007 --> 30:29.973
You're damn right
I'm scaring her, all right?

30:29.975 --> 30:32.776
They're laughing at us outside.
We need to strike back.

30:32.778 --> 30:34.712
No! No, he's not a cop.

30:34.714 --> 30:35.913
He's a negotiator,

30:35.915 --> 30:37.681
and he wants the same thing you want...

30:37.683 --> 30:39.883
for everybody to go home alive.

30:39.885 --> 30:41.018
Now, Angie.

30:53.466 --> 30:54.631
This is Eric.

30:54.633 --> 30:55.866
Am I speaking with Teddy?

30:55.868 --> 30:57.735
Do you mind if I call you Teddy?

30:58.984 --> 31:01.338
You can call me what you want.

31:01.340 --> 31:02.740
She said you want to help us.

31:03.661 --> 31:04.975
I can get you a list of all the clients

31:04.977 --> 31:07.378
who rent those safety deposit boxes.

31:08.128 --> 31:09.729
Would that be helpful?

31:11.116 --> 31:12.416
Why do you want to help us?

31:12.418 --> 31:14.718
The man your friend shot,
he needs medical attention.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.388
You know it, I know it.

31:17.525 --> 31:19.456
The sooner you get what you want,

31:19.458 --> 31:21.525
the sooner we all go home.

31:24.063 --> 31:25.429
Send the list.

31:27.374 --> 31:29.500
Get back out there.

31:43.783 --> 31:45.783
_

31:52.491 --> 31:55.659
Let them through. Let them through here.

31:56.976 --> 31:59.997
Oliver's confirmed
the list has been received.

31:59.999 --> 32:01.665
I don't expect Ms. Bloom's clients

32:01.667 --> 32:04.268
will be very happy you shared
their list with the robbers.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.670
I don't expect her clients will care.

32:07.191 --> 32:08.490
Why not?

32:10.618 --> 32:12.042
Because the box they're looking for

32:12.044 --> 32:13.143
doesn't belong to them.

32:13.145 --> 32:15.012
It belongs to your client...

32:15.014 --> 32:16.945
Elizabeth Bloom.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.036
Come on!

32:36.704 --> 32:38.170
Is that it?

32:39.740 --> 32:41.834
That's it.

32:42.476 --> 32:44.895
Yes.

32:47.081 --> 32:48.680
That... that's worth like what,

32:48.682 --> 32:50.415
$10... $10, $20 million bucks, right?

32:50.417 --> 32:52.718
More. A whole lot more.

32:54.888 --> 32:56.320
And we can just walk out of here.

32:56.322 --> 32:57.956
Loud and proud.

32:59.219 --> 33:01.586
Get that negotiator back on the phone.

33:15.743 --> 33:19.945
Fletcher, I never should have
given them the list of names.

33:19.947 --> 33:21.908
We need him to find that tape.

33:21.910 --> 33:23.281
And once he's got it,

33:23.283 --> 33:25.450
he's gonna upload it and have us both.

33:25.452 --> 33:27.519
No. I can take care of that.

33:27.521 --> 33:29.554
Let's just hope the negotiator
does what he's supposed to do.

33:30.401 --> 33:33.089
If not, I'll do what I have to do, okay?

33:33.091 --> 33:34.593
Don't worry.

33:47.800 --> 33:48.993
You got something.

33:49.469 --> 33:52.003
I had to unseal records
from the internal investigation.

33:52.005 --> 33:53.804
How did you know
that there was a connection

33:53.806 --> 33:55.740
between Teddy Grimes
and Elizabeth Bloom?

33:55.742 --> 33:58.009
I knew it the moment I saw
her name on that list.

33:58.011 --> 34:00.178
Ms. Bloom is a real estate developer,

34:00.180 --> 34:01.379
whose many projects include

34:01.381 --> 34:03.681
the tenement where that teenager
was shot in 2008.

34:04.178 --> 34:06.584
It seems the security camera
was operating that night,

34:06.586 --> 34:08.485
but the tape went missing.

34:08.487 --> 34:11.054
I'm guessing Ms. Bloom
isn't the only name to come up

34:11.056 --> 34:12.489
in that internal investigation.

34:12.492 --> 34:13.891
In his testimony,

34:13.893 --> 34:16.327
Grimes claimed that he was
alone in the squad car.

34:16.864 --> 34:17.995
But Commissioner Fletcher

34:17.996 --> 34:19.597
was his superior officer at the time

34:19.929 --> 34:21.264
and on duty that night.

34:21.266 --> 34:24.202
We think Fletcher shot that kid
and made Grimes take the fall.

34:24.204 --> 34:26.377
The missing tape would prove it.

34:27.873 --> 34:29.706
That's quite a valuable tape.

34:29.708 --> 34:31.576
Ms. Bloom may have been
using it all these years

34:31.578 --> 34:35.045
to blackmail Commissioner
Fletcher... special treatment.

34:35.047 --> 34:36.781
And now that Grimes is out of prison,

34:36.783 --> 34:38.748
he figures he can blackmail
both of them.

34:38.751 --> 34:41.118
No surprise Grimes thought
he could take all these hostages

34:41.120 --> 34:41.953
and still walk away.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.721
With that tape,

34:43.723 --> 34:45.755
he's got Fletcher in his back pocket.

34:48.261 --> 34:49.793
Grimes is calling back.

34:50.929 --> 34:52.663
Show time.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.000
All right, here's the deal.

34:56.002 --> 34:58.002
We need safe passage to Teterboro

34:58.004 --> 34:59.170
with a plane waiting.

35:02.375 --> 35:03.341
Okay.

35:04.065 --> 35:05.243
I need you to guarantee

35:05.245 --> 35:06.510
the safety of those hostages, Teddy.

35:06.512 --> 35:07.878
One more condition...

35:08.555 --> 35:11.582
I need a secure Internet
connection, and I need it now.

35:11.584 --> 35:12.850
And that's non-negotiable,

35:12.852 --> 35:14.885
or so help me God, we'll start
putting bullets in heads.

35:14.887 --> 35:18.256
What the hell does he need
an Internet connection for?

35:18.258 --> 35:19.590
Whatever he's found in that vault,

35:19.592 --> 35:20.791
I think he means to upload it

35:20.793 --> 35:22.360
as some kind of insurance policy.

35:27.411 --> 35:29.539
Okay, then. Let's get this over with.

35:34.278 --> 35:35.766
You got it, Teddy.

35:40.647 --> 35:42.580
They're doing it.

35:42.582 --> 35:44.448
All right, I'll take care
of the Internet connection.

35:44.450 --> 35:45.571
You get him the plane.

35:45.573 --> 35:47.351
So we're just letting them go?

35:47.837 --> 35:50.221
Commander, did you not just hear me?

35:52.765 --> 35:56.227
Why let them upload the tape
if it proves his guilt?

35:58.097 --> 35:59.563
Maybe we're wrong.

35:59.565 --> 36:00.531
No.

36:00.973 --> 36:02.633
This is what he wants to happen.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.670
You're a cop. You never make a deal.

36:05.672 --> 36:07.301
He knew I would.

36:08.274 --> 36:09.840
Maxine, come with me, please.

36:09.842 --> 36:11.942
I want you to see this.

36:15.615 --> 36:16.848
It's done.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.418
Here. Take this.

36:25.858 --> 36:29.667
Okay. Uh-huh.

36:30.396 --> 36:32.897
Which one of you wants to go for a ride?

36:32.899 --> 36:34.565
You. Come on.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.733
No.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.668
Get up! Get the... Get up!

36:37.670 --> 36:41.004
Wait! Take me instead.

36:45.044 --> 36:46.410
Down.

36:49.449 --> 36:52.216
Okay, officer. Let's go.

36:52.218 --> 36:53.250
Go.

36:53.252 --> 36:54.759
Go.

36:55.621 --> 36:57.278
Angie!

36:59.092 --> 37:01.459
Suspects are in the vehicle.

37:01.461 --> 37:03.627
Hostages being released.

37:13.673 --> 37:14.839
What are we doing?

37:14.841 --> 37:15.639
Wait there.

37:19.178 --> 37:20.277
What the hell's he doing?

37:20.279 --> 37:21.312
Take him out!

37:21.314 --> 37:22.313
Eric, I...

37:22.315 --> 37:23.447
I said wait there.

37:23.449 --> 37:24.750
Eric, stop!

37:26.586 --> 37:28.486
Run him down, and we're out of here!

37:29.622 --> 37:30.654
Stop!

37:31.991 --> 37:33.424
Aah!

37:40.466 --> 37:43.100
I know you didn't shoot
that unarmed kid, Teddy.

37:45.037 --> 37:47.571
You took the fall for Fletcher,
and that tape proves it.

37:47.573 --> 37:49.173
You're damn straight it does!

37:51.043 --> 37:52.119
If you drive out of here with it,

37:52.144 --> 37:53.143
Fletcher's gonna kill you.

37:53.829 --> 37:54.879
He's lying.

37:55.346 --> 37:57.344
You know this man.

37:59.385 --> 38:00.751
You helped him cover up his murder,

38:00.753 --> 38:02.953
and you when you wanted
to come clean, he framed you.

38:06.559 --> 38:08.359
There's snipers on the rooftops, Teddy.

38:08.361 --> 38:10.378
You're sitting ducks.

38:12.799 --> 38:14.265
He can't do that.

38:14.267 --> 38:16.234
We got an insurance policy.

38:16.702 --> 38:19.236
You don't think he'd really
let up upload that, do you?

38:19.705 --> 38:21.272
The only real proof is that tape.

38:21.274 --> 38:22.506
Now, you give it to me,
and I will make sure

38:22.508 --> 38:25.176
that Bloom and Fletcher face justice.

38:25.881 --> 38:27.178
Teddy?

38:28.514 --> 38:30.114
Teddy, come on.

38:30.983 --> 38:33.217
Teddy, you said they'd pay us millions.

38:33.219 --> 38:34.985
$10 million, you said! You said that!

38:34.987 --> 38:36.586
That's not gonna happen, pal.

38:37.123 --> 38:38.507
It's over.

38:39.058 --> 38:40.524
Put your gun down.

38:46.299 --> 38:47.531
I'm not going back to prison.

38:47.533 --> 38:50.568
I'm not going back to prison!

38:58.845 --> 39:00.511
You're under arrest!

39:04.884 --> 39:06.584
I've been waiting
my whole life to say that.

39:17.172 --> 39:18.896
Oh, good. Here comes the calvary.

39:24.871 --> 39:26.904
All yours, fellas.

39:50.196 --> 39:51.395
At this point,

39:51.397 --> 39:53.330
we know that two suspects
have been apprehended

39:53.332 --> 39:54.732
by the police.

39:54.734 --> 39:56.257
I love you.

39:57.981 --> 40:02.239
Officer Rose, this is
my associate, Maxine Carlson.

40:02.241 --> 40:04.275
You were amazing back there.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.818
No, I...

40:07.280 --> 40:09.313
It was you that gave me
the courage to do it.

40:14.447 --> 40:15.979
Okay.

40:20.726 --> 40:23.027
I guess Bill was right when he said

40:23.029 --> 40:25.329
nothing good ever comes in life
unless you work at it.

40:27.033 --> 40:28.287
Thank you.

40:32.204 --> 40:34.138
That was Zara.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.373
Fletcher and Bloom are on the run.

40:36.375 --> 40:37.474
Well, they won't get far

40:37.476 --> 40:39.410
now that the authorities have that tape.

40:39.412 --> 40:41.078
I don't get it.

40:41.080 --> 40:44.481
Bloom gave us the list of boxes
with her own name on it,

40:44.483 --> 40:46.525
knowing they'd find that tape.

40:47.253 --> 40:49.954
What choice did she have
under the circumstances?

40:49.956 --> 40:51.703
The clever part
was getting Grimes to think

40:51.705 --> 40:53.157
that he had uploaded it.

40:54.594 --> 40:55.693
How do you do it?

40:55.918 --> 40:57.194
Do what?

40:57.646 --> 40:59.678
Anticipate everything.

41:02.238 --> 41:03.434
I have to go.

41:04.399 --> 41:06.170
Not everything, Ms. Carlson.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.542
Excuse me.

41:10.209 --> 41:11.408
Ms. Bloom was right.

41:11.410 --> 41:13.811
Your insurance company ended up
not paying a dime.

41:13.813 --> 41:14.778
And I'm very grateful.

41:14.780 --> 41:15.746
Well in that case,

41:15.748 --> 41:17.247
how about some dinner to celebrate?

41:17.249 --> 41:19.516
Huh. You don't really expect me
to say yes, do you?

41:19.518 --> 41:20.884
You know, we could
pick up Evie together,

41:20.886 --> 41:23.350
open a bottle of wine
at Carlo's just like old times.

41:23.756 --> 41:26.561
You're really good
at what you do, Mr. Beaumont.

41:26.563 --> 41:28.527
Why, thank you, Mrs. Beaumont.

41:29.228 --> 41:31.629
Maxine hero-worships you, of course.

41:31.631 --> 41:32.696
Well, the young lady wants to learn.

41:32.698 --> 41:33.731
I'm happy to teach her.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.266
I know who her mother is,

41:36.268 --> 41:38.702
and she may not
be as stable as you think

41:38.704 --> 41:40.070
given her family history.

41:40.072 --> 41:41.138
Are you questioning me?

41:41.140 --> 41:42.887
I thought I was the best at what I did.

41:44.610 --> 41:46.443
Be careful, Eric.

41:46.445 --> 41:48.278
Is that love and affection that I hear?

41:48.639 --> 41:49.813
Of course it is.

41:51.117 --> 41:52.650
You're impossible to be married to,

41:52.652 --> 41:55.552
but you're still
the father of our daughter

41:55.554 --> 41:58.999
and the best man I've ever known.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.869
