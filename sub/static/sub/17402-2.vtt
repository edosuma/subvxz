00:11.480 --> 00:13.480
Tonight, I play tennis.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.799
Richard points at a minibus.

00:17.800 --> 00:22.000
And James shakes hands with two men.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.999
Thank you so much. Hello!
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.800
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Now...

00:37.160 --> 00:38.799
Now, a few years ago,

00:38.800 --> 00:43.599
bosses at a Cheshire-based
engineering company called BAC

00:43.600 --> 00:46.319
decided they'd like to make a car.

00:46.320 --> 00:50.119
Now, because they're from
Cheshire, I assumed it would be made

00:50.120 --> 00:52.959
from onyx and have bull's-eye glass
in the windows

00:52.960 --> 00:57.799
and then door mirrors made
out of Wayne Rooney's ears. But no.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.439
They decided it should have

00:59.440 --> 01:02.439
the four-cylinder engine
from a Ford people van,

01:02.440 --> 01:05.479
the gearbox from a Formula 3 racing
car

01:05.480 --> 01:07.959
and that it should be upholstered

01:07.960 --> 01:11.839
in the same stain-resistant and
waterproof material

01:11.840 --> 01:16.679
that they use to line furniture
in old people's homes.

01:16.680 --> 01:20.239
And then they turned their attention
to how it should look.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.999
Most car designers,
for their inspiration,

01:23.000 --> 01:25.479
go to big cats
and bats and jet fighters.

01:25.480 --> 01:30.319
But the men from Cheshire decided
they didn't want any of that.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.759
They decided to take
their inspiration from this.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.920 --> 01:49.679
So, the styling of an Icelandic
robot from a Bjork pop video,

01:49.680 --> 01:54.279
the gearbox from a racing car
and the engine from a van.

01:54.280 --> 01:59.160
Bring them all together,
and this is the result.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.040
It's called the Mono,
and it's amazing.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.159
The engine may be
from a Ford people carrier,

02:18.160 --> 02:24.040
but it's been fettled by Cosworth,
so now it produces 280 horsepower.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.999
And fitting a 280 horsepower heart

02:29.000 --> 02:32.079
in a car which weighs
just half a tonne is...

02:32.080 --> 02:36.240
Well, the effects
are going to be profound.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.359
I can see why they lined it

02:46.360 --> 02:51.279
with material designed to resist
trouser accidents,

02:51.280 --> 02:54.479
because my bladder's gone!

02:54.480 --> 02:59.120
It's completely gone!
I've wet myself.

03:08.360 --> 03:12.399
0 to 60 takes just 2.8 seconds.

03:12.400 --> 03:17.079
And in theory, the top speed is 170.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.479
But in reality, it isn't,

03:18.480 --> 03:21.839
because the Mono has the same
problem as the Ariel Atom.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.720
No windscreen.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.440
At 70 miles an hour,
your face starts to move about.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.880
And then when you get to 80,
it starts to come off.

03:41.160 --> 03:46.120
'At 90, you're forced to accept
that really, you need a helmet.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.879
'With a lid on,
you can start to appreciate

03:58.880 --> 04:00.840
'just how clever this car is.'

04:02.560 --> 04:06.840
First of all, I fit. I mean,
only just, but I do actually fit.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.719
And even though it has

04:09.720 --> 04:11.719
Formula One-style
pushrod suspension,

04:11.720 --> 04:15.080
the ride is sublime. You could
almost call it comfortable.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.319
Although, that said, at high revs,

04:19.320 --> 04:22.560
everything starts to tingle
and vibrate.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.839
I don't want to go into too many
details, but let me put it this way.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.160
If I were a girl,
I'd like it very much.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.079
Strangely, even cross-eyed women

04:36.080 --> 04:39.119
can drive this car legally
on the road.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.439
But realistically,
it's built for the track.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.000
So, let's see what's what.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.280
It's not really about
straight-line speed.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.600
It doesn't actually feel that fast.

05:02.040 --> 05:06.839
And when you get used to it,
it's not that scary, either.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.719
If I'm honest,
it's not really like driving, this.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.319
It's like conducting an orchestra

05:13.320 --> 05:16.839
of parts that know exactly
what they're doing.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.120
They're very well rehearsed.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.720
There goes the French horns,
and here are the violins.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.639
The brakes, they're good.
Gearbox is fantastic.

05:33.640 --> 05:39.639
It really is an absolutely instant
change. Bang, bang, bang, ready.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.360
'And there's more.'

05:47.760 --> 05:49.879
Because all the heavy stuff,
the engine,

05:49.880 --> 05:52.479
the gearbox and the driver,
is all in a line,

05:52.480 --> 05:54.439
low down in the middle of the car,

05:54.440 --> 05:58.000
it has the same centre of gravity
as a worm.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.999
Couple that to the F1 suspension
and the specially-made tyres,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.640
and the cornering speeds
are simply immense.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.479
To demonstrate how immense,

06:14.480 --> 06:16.879
we've set up a radar trap
on the follow-through,

06:16.880 --> 06:21.640
and coming through it now, as fast
as possible, is a Peugeot 208.

06:28.440 --> 06:32.759
83.5 miles an hour.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.800
'Then it was the turn of a BMW M3.'

06:39.560 --> 06:43.599
Ooh, now, look at that.
90.25 miles an hour.

06:43.600 --> 06:49.400
'After a Nissan GT-R had a go,
we unleashed the Mono.'

06:53.280 --> 06:55.479
See my point?

06:55.480 --> 06:59.479
It is very fast, then, and it's fun.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.039
But what about reliability,

07:01.040 --> 07:03.159
traditionally not a strong point

07:03.160 --> 07:05.640
for small-volume
British sports cars?

07:06.920 --> 07:09.919
The first time I drove a Mono,
it set fire to itself.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.839
The second time,
the engine went wonky,

07:11.840 --> 07:15.919
and the third time, it broke down
before it had even left the factory.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.359
So I thought of it, really,
as another typically British,

07:19.360 --> 07:22.839
badly-executed good idea.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.639
But since all those calamities,

07:25.640 --> 07:29.719
they've had 12 months to work
on the design and the detailing,

07:29.720 --> 07:35.239
and I have to say, it looks
not just very well thought out,

07:35.240 --> 07:39.040
but absolutely beautifully made.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.679
And it's not just the detailing
that's beautiful, either.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.519
When you stand back,

07:46.520 --> 07:51.360
that's one of the most exciting
shapes I've ever seen.

07:53.920 --> 07:58.920
The Mono is the nicest thing to come
out of Cheshire since the cheese.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.919
But it does cost £102,000, and that,

08:03.920 --> 08:07.200
for a twice-a-year toy, is a lot.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.359
In many ways, then,
this is a bit like an iPad,

08:16.360 --> 08:20.199
because that's not cheap either,
and you certainly don't need one.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.639
But you want one,

08:21.640 --> 08:25.280
because it's such a lovely... thing.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.119
It is. - It's gorgeous. - I know.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.079
And beautifully made.
It's a piece of jewellery.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.599
But...

08:53.600 --> 08:57.119
What? - £102,000?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.719
I know, it is expensive,

08:58.720 --> 09:00.519
especially when you bear in mind

09:00.520 --> 09:04.079
all the other brilliant track-day
cars you can buy for a lot less,

09:04.080 --> 09:05.799
the KTM, Radical, Ariel Atom.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.839
- Morgan 3 Wheeler.
- No, I said brilliant.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.359
All right, the Caterham R500.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.559
That's a brilliant track-day car,
and that's half the price of this.

09:13.560 --> 09:17.559
Yes, and that is enormously fast.
But will this be faster?

09:17.560 --> 09:21.719
To find out, we shall hand it over
to our tame racing driver.

09:21.720 --> 09:25.079
Some say that he breaks
into people's houses at night

09:25.080 --> 09:29.080
and leaves two mysterious extra keys
in a kitchen drawer...

09:30.800 --> 09:33.959
And that as a result of buying
Pirelli condoms this week,

09:33.960 --> 09:35.640
he now has 17 children.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.400
All we know is,
he's called The Stig!

09:40.560 --> 09:42.559
Stig snaps to attention,
and he's off,

09:42.560 --> 09:44.319
flicking off the line like a flea,

09:44.320 --> 09:46.599
even though the start-finish line
was damp.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.559
Hopefully,
the rest of the track's dry.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.239
Flying into the first corner,
he came in very hot there,

09:52.240 --> 09:55.200
but sorted it out.
No problem at all.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.759
No stereo, of course,

09:58.760 --> 10:02.079
just the sound of that
Cosworth-tuned engine

10:02.080 --> 10:05.759
as he zips round Chicago
absolutely rock-solid.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.839
Now, Hammerhead.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.919
What will this reveal about
the mid-engine balance?

10:10.920 --> 10:13.999
No drama.
That is properly nailed down.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.239
But look, a well-orchestrated drift
on the way out!

10:19.240 --> 10:24.519
High revs now. The vibrations will
be stimulating his lady parts.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.719
Follow-through and yes, he actually
changed up through there.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.919
Stig is brave,
even on the brink of a crisis.

10:31.920 --> 10:36.519
Controlling it beautifully
into the second-to-last corner.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.159
Screams up to Gambon,
racing gearbox whining.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.200
Slides it through,
and across the line.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.559
Now... here we have
the Caterham R500,

10:50.560 --> 10:54.159
which did it in 1.17.9, yeah?

10:54.160 --> 10:56.080
BAC Mono...

11:01.040 --> 11:02.639
1.14.3.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.639
No way!

11:04.640 --> 11:07.439
Wow! - The second-fastest car
we've ever had!

11:07.440 --> 11:10.159
That is something else.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.039
Tremendous. Excellent.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.959
And now,
now it is time for the news,

11:16.960 --> 11:19.159
and it's good news,

11:19.160 --> 11:22.119
because the Dacia Duster has been
named

11:22.120 --> 11:26.319
budget 4x4 tow car of the year.

11:26.320 --> 11:31.159
Great. Now, I've bought a bicycle. - I
thought you were looking a bit trim.

11:31.160 --> 11:34.199
Well, do you know, it's not really
the weight that I've lost,

11:34.200 --> 11:36.519
- but my core, what's it called?
- Core strength.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.279
Are we on Loose Women or something?

11:39.280 --> 11:40.839
No, James, as you well know,

11:40.840 --> 11:44.479
we have for many years been
on Last Of The Summer Gear.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.519
Since I bought my bicycle,
what's driving me mad

11:46.520 --> 11:49.679
is the amount of people who come and say
"You need to get lycra shorts now".

11:49.680 --> 11:53.439
Well, you do, because it's more
comfortable and it stops chafing.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.039
No, Hammond, you don't.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.919
People who wear lycra shorts go,

11:56.920 --> 12:00.639
"Look, it's difficult and dangerous,
and I need special..." You don't.

12:00.640 --> 12:04.159
In fact, the only thing I do wear
as a concession that I make

12:04.160 --> 12:05.839
is this T-shirt, OK? This is

12:05.840 --> 12:07.919
the back of it as I'm riding along.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.640
"Motorists, thank you for letting me
use your roads."

12:12.720 --> 12:14.319
Because I think that's polite.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.519
I don't believe you have a bicycle.
What kind of bicycle is it?

12:17.520 --> 12:19.359
I don't know, they're all the same.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.639
Is it a mountain bike,
is it a racer?

12:21.640 --> 12:23.799
When you went to the shop,
you walked through

12:23.800 --> 12:27.479
the door of a bicycle shop
and the man went, "Oh, my God".

12:27.480 --> 12:30.159
And you went "I'd like..."?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.399
I just said, "Can I have the one
nearest to the door?"

12:32.400 --> 12:35.319
He was trying to say, "You can
have this one for £10,000..."

12:35.320 --> 12:38.799
I said "No, I just want a bicycle."
500 quid.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.079
This bicycle he sold you,

12:40.080 --> 12:43.159
is the front wheel a lot bigger
than the back wheel? - No.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.719
It's just a bike.
They're all the same.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.399
Has it got two little ones
at the back?

12:48.400 --> 12:50.679
No, it hasn't got stabilisers.

12:50.680 --> 12:55.599
I don't believe you, and I think
this has become a new mystery.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.839
It's like a yeti.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.239
So if maybe somebody's seen him,

12:59.240 --> 13:02.239
if you have seen Jeremy
on his bicycle, write to us, please,

13:02.240 --> 13:06.519
at "Help, I've Burst From Laughing",
Top Gear, Wood Lane, wherever.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.079
I don't believe you.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.599
I'm going to ride... No, I'm not
going to ride down here next week.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.839
That's idiotic.
I barely ride to the paper shop.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.279
Now, who saw the British Grand Prix
last weekend?

13:16.280 --> 13:17.399
Yes!

13:17.400 --> 13:19.679
You may have noticed there were
a lot of blowouts, OK,

13:19.680 --> 13:23.039
and I must say,
I feel rather sorry for Pirelli.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.159
For the last few years,

13:24.160 --> 13:27.119
their tyres have been really good
and grippy and lasted too long,

13:27.120 --> 13:28.759
so the organisers said to Pirelli,

13:28.760 --> 13:30.959
"Can you design a tyre
that's a bit rubbish?"

13:30.960 --> 13:32.919
So they did,
and now everyone's saying,

13:32.920 --> 13:34.359
"Your tyres are a bit rubbish".

13:34.360 --> 13:35.679
So how rubbish is too rubbish?

13:35.680 --> 13:38.319
How much do you think Pirelli spent
developing those tyres?

13:38.320 --> 13:39.960
It's got to be...100 quid?

13:41.320 --> 13:42.839
It's going to be millions.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.639
Yeah, millions of pounds
developing a tyre,

13:45.640 --> 13:48.479
and all they get in response is
people going into tyre warehouses

13:48.480 --> 13:51.479
and saying "I need four new tyres
for my car, just not Pirellis".

13:51.480 --> 13:54.839
Right. - And then I make silly jokes
when introducing the Stig about it.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.839
It's gone wrong! It backfired.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.119
This is exactly why
I don't get Formula One,

13:59.120 --> 14:02.759
because surely it should be the
pinnacle of automotive technology.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.119
Pirelli should make a tyre

14:04.120 --> 14:06.079
as good as it is possible
to make a tyre.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.039
They should have
active aerodynamics,

14:08.040 --> 14:11.519
they should have traction control,
the most sophisticated in the world,

14:11.520 --> 14:13.319
ABS, invisibility cloaks, all that.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.759
They should be allowed to have
anything they want.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.439
The problem is, the organisers
are trying to make Formula One

14:18.440 --> 14:21.559
a level playing field to make it a
drivers' championship. And it isn't.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.519
You could put Sebastian Vettel
in a Marussia

14:23.520 --> 14:25.319
- and he's going to come last.
- Exactly.

14:25.320 --> 14:28.359
Let's just make it
a championship for car-makers,

14:28.360 --> 14:31.519
and then let the designers
have completely free rein.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.719
You know what I'd do?

14:32.720 --> 14:35.960
I'd make a car that was the exact
width of the track.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.199
- How clever's that?
- That's interesting.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.359
That would only work
if you qualified at the front.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.559
No, you wouldn't have to,

14:45.560 --> 14:47.799
because it would be a Top Fuel-type
dragster, OK?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.599
So it'd be very poor
around the corners

14:49.600 --> 14:50.879
and I'd qualify last,

14:50.880 --> 14:53.919
but I would accelerate really
quickly past them all

14:53.920 --> 14:56.919
before the first corner,
and then it would expand.

14:56.920 --> 15:01.199
- Oh, it grows.
- I've just won the championship.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.999
Jeremy, what you're proposing
is Wacky Races.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.359
I know! Just think,
you could have, like,

15:06.360 --> 15:10.559
a dog as your co-driver that goes...

15:10.560 --> 15:14.679
I want a giant circular saw
on the front of my car.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.279
But here's the clever thing.
I can only use it once a lap.

15:18.280 --> 15:23.479
So you've got DRS zone,
then the saw zone. It's a good idea.

15:23.480 --> 15:29.159
I'd fit my Formula One car
with time travel. Think about it.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.400
The commentator would go "And
they're off! And James had won."

15:35.400 --> 15:38.520
- That's clever.
- We've solved Formula One.

15:39.600 --> 15:44.119
Again, the world just doesn't work
without us in it. - No.

15:44.120 --> 15:49.319
Volvo News! - Hooray. - They have
launched a car which parks itself.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.559
And I don't mean you sit in it.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.239
The idea is, you pull up
outside your office, get out,

15:53.240 --> 15:54.559
go into your office.

15:54.560 --> 16:01.039
It goes off, finds a space, I'm not
making this up, and parks in it.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.199
The only problem is,
when you come out of your office,

16:04.200 --> 16:06.080
how do you know where it's parked?

16:07.920 --> 16:10.639
But what if it had to park
three streets away?

16:10.640 --> 16:12.920
Or what if it's just given up
and gone home?

16:14.280 --> 16:16.239
Hang on,
how does it know what the rules are?

16:16.240 --> 16:18.679
You know those signs that go
with single yellow lines

16:18.680 --> 16:20.999
and those ones where there
are two lines on the kerb?

16:21.000 --> 16:24.039
They're complicated. And it's
Swedish anyway, so it can't read it.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.559
What worries me about this is,

16:26.560 --> 16:30.159
the roads will be full of driverless,
slightly panicky Volvos

16:30.160 --> 16:31.399
scurrying about going,

16:31.400 --> 16:33.959
"Can I park here? Can I park there?
Where can I go?"

16:33.960 --> 16:36.559
- It's going to be terrifying.
- It's the lampposts. - What?

16:36.560 --> 16:39.920
All the lampposts will have missing
Volvo pictures on. - Aww.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.319
"He's only a year old
and he's called Tiddles

16:43.320 --> 16:47.080
"and he went off to find a parking
space and I haven't seen him since!"

16:48.800 --> 16:50.479
Anyway, let's move on.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.679
There has been a whole rash of new
supercars launched recently.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.479
This is the one I'm interested in,
this Ferrari. - Ooh.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.559
Indeed, ooh.
It has an 800 horsepower V12.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.319
It has a KERS system
like a Formula One car.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.559
It's going to cost around a
million quid,

17:05.560 --> 17:08.159
but I think they've got a bit
of a problem with the name,

17:08.160 --> 17:10.799
because they've called it
LaFerrari.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.999
Sorry, what's wrong with that?
I mean, it is.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.638
No, but that's the model name.

17:15.640 --> 17:19.319
LaFerrari means "the Ferrari",
so that's the Ferrari the Ferrari.

17:19.319 --> 17:23.239
Oh, yeah. The supercar
I really want is by Pagani.

17:23.240 --> 17:26.079
They've got a new car out,
except they sort of haven't,

17:26.079 --> 17:27.679
because it's yet another version

17:27.680 --> 17:29.639
of the Zonda, their old car.
There it is.

17:29.640 --> 17:33.719
And what's new about that? - Not
a lot, really, apart from the price.

17:33.720 --> 17:39.839
- It's now £2.3 million. - What?
- Yeah. - For a second-hand car?

17:39.840 --> 17:41.519
Yeah.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.759
You know, the one
I'm most interested in,

17:43.760 --> 17:48.039
this is the McLaren P1, because this
is just shy of a million quid,

17:48.040 --> 17:52.599
so it's almost a bargain. And it's
got a 903 horsepower engine. 903.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.199
What fascinates me is,

17:54.200 --> 17:57.279
there's a wing that comes out
of the back of it

17:57.280 --> 17:59.079
which has got DRS on it.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.839
You know what DRS is, with the...
In Formula One, it opens.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.159
If you've got 903 horsepower,
when would you ever think,

18:06.160 --> 18:08.599
"Right, I need more straight-line
speed.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.399
"I'll deploy the DRS wing"?

18:10.400 --> 18:11.599
Well, it could happen.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.719
"That post office van is getting
a shift on. I'll deploy DRS."

18:14.720 --> 18:18.559
No, you will need that, your DRS,

18:18.560 --> 18:21.039
when you come across me
in the Ferrari the Ferrari,

18:21.040 --> 18:23.119
because, I hadn't read this
properly,

18:23.120 --> 18:26.079
it has got 800 horsepower
in the engine, but of course,

18:26.080 --> 18:27.359
it's got a KERS system.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.079
When you deploy it
and use the electric bit as well,

18:30.080 --> 18:33.879
ahem, 963 horsepower.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.479
And is that all going through
the rear wheels? - Yes, it is.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.759
Hang on, that's broadly
the same amount of power

18:39.760 --> 18:40.879
you get from a Bugatti,

18:40.880 --> 18:43.279
which is almost exactly
twice as heavy

18:43.280 --> 18:47.799
as the Ferrari the Ferrari,
and it has four-wheel-drive.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.839
- That's going to be "an handful".
- Yes.

18:51.840 --> 18:57.679
- Exciting, though. I want a go in it.
- I really want to go in the McLaren.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.879
That would be an epic test.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.319
You in that Ferrari, you in
the McLaren, me in that Zonda.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.439
Anybody want to see that?

19:02.440 --> 19:04.079
Yeah!

19:04.080 --> 19:07.359
So do I. - Let's see
if we can put that together.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.959
But you know how people often come
up to us and say,

19:10.960 --> 19:12.719
"When will Top Gear end?"

19:12.720 --> 19:15.679
About three minutes after us three
have set off.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.199
Yeah, in a big fireball.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.079
Does anybody want to see THAT?

19:19.080 --> 19:20.359
Yes!

19:20.360 --> 19:24.079
Right, let's move on, because it is
now 11 years we've been on air,

19:24.080 --> 19:25.359
and in all that time,

19:25.360 --> 19:29.679
there is one vehicle that we have
never reviewed, which is a surprise,

19:29.680 --> 19:31.639
because it's the most popular,

19:31.640 --> 19:34.360
important and used vehicle
in the world.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.959
I'm talking, of course,
about the taxi,

19:39.960 --> 19:44.000
the lifeblood of people movement
wherever you go in the world.

19:47.840 --> 19:52.199
And Britain's contribution to
this effort needs no introduction.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.920
It's a staple
of any London street scene.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.919
There are currently
around 19,000 black cabs

20:00.920 --> 20:03.999
moving people across the capital,

20:04.000 --> 20:09.439
and this vast fleet covers
almost half a billion miles a year.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.679
There's another.
They are literally everywhere.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.599
London life has caused the black cab

20:15.600 --> 20:19.559
to evolve into
an amazingly efficient vehicle.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.599
Its famous tiny turning circle,
for example,

20:22.600 --> 20:26.520
is the result of the need to tackle
the roundabout outside the Savoy.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.720
Then there's the black cab driver.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.799
No cabbie in the world
has to go through

20:34.800 --> 20:37.759
an ordeal as fearsome
as The Knowledge,

20:37.760 --> 20:44.399
which requires that all London
taxi drivers memorise 25,000 streets.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.879
The test is so tough, in fact,

20:45.880 --> 20:49.159
that cabbies develop an extra large
hippocampus,

20:49.160 --> 20:53.439
which is the area of the brain
associated with memory, navigation

20:53.440 --> 20:55.200
and views on immigration.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.159
Put this combination of man
and machine together,

20:59.160 --> 21:02.559
and what you have is indisputable.

21:02.560 --> 21:08.239
What you have is, without doubt,
obviously, unquestionably,

21:08.240 --> 21:11.200
no arguments,
the best taxi in the world.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.880
Or is it?

21:16.600 --> 21:18.999
The thing is, a New York taxi driver

21:19.000 --> 21:22.279
would probably disagree
with that statement.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.479
He'd say "Yeah, you may have
more space in the back,

21:26.480 --> 21:31.159
"but your London taxi is slow
and the ride is terrible,

21:31.160 --> 21:35.239
"whereas my yellow taxi has
a big V8 and proper suspension."

21:35.240 --> 21:37.359
But then a cabbie in Delhi would
say,

21:37.360 --> 21:39.799
"My Indian taxi is built
to last longer".

21:39.800 --> 21:42.999
Basically, every cabbie
everywhere in the world

21:43.000 --> 21:47.239
could argue for one reason or another
that their taxi is the best.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.799
Which means, if we really want
to find out

21:49.800 --> 21:52.279
which is the greatest taxi
in the world,

21:52.280 --> 21:54.199
there is only one way to do it,

21:54.200 --> 21:57.479
and that is, as ever,
in the prism of the furnace

21:57.480 --> 22:02.279
through the looking glass
of the crucible of motorsport.

22:02.280 --> 22:07.359
That means a race, and the venue
for our global showdown

22:07.360 --> 22:09.679
will be Lydden Hill in Kent,

22:09.680 --> 22:13.079
famous throughout the motorsport
world

22:13.080 --> 22:17.480
for being the only race track
with its own cab office.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.879
That plywood cab office looks
perilously close to the track.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.719
I sincerely hope no harm befalls it.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.080
Anyway, let's now meet our grid
of taxis from around the world.

22:34.200 --> 22:39.119
Representing Great Britain,
we have a 1997 Fairway driver which,

22:39.120 --> 22:43.720
with a mere 320,000 miles
on the clock, is barely run in.

22:48.440 --> 22:52.279
From Mexico,
a 1970 Volkswagen Beetle.

22:52.280 --> 22:57.120
50,000 of these things ply
their trade in Mexico City alone.

22:58.480 --> 23:02.279
From America,
one of the titans of the taxi world,

23:02.280 --> 23:03.800
a New York yellow cab.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.879
This particular one is a Ford Crown
Victoria, rear-wheel drive,

23:08.880 --> 23:12.439
4.6 litre V8
and in its day, good for 130.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.120
That's one to worry about.

23:16.480 --> 23:21.839
From India, the Hindustan Ambassador,
very much the old-timer here.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.319
The Ambassador has been
India's favourite taxi

23:25.320 --> 23:27.360
for an incredible 55 years.

23:28.640 --> 23:34.039
Next, from South Africa,
we have this. A Toyota HiAce.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.719
Whereas in most countries,

23:35.720 --> 23:38.279
they will be rooting
for their local taxi,

23:38.280 --> 23:41.239
you can expect the South Africans
to be booing,

23:41.240 --> 23:46.040
because these things are hated and
feared for their wild aggression.

23:47.400 --> 23:52.559
Moving on to this, from Germany.
It's the Mercedes E-Class.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.200
Neat, smart
and fastidiously maintained.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.760
And finally, from Russia,
a Stretched Lincoln Town Car.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.280
Now, that might not look like a cab,
but it is.

24:07.560 --> 24:11.640
In Russia, rich oligarchs hail limos
just like this to get around.

24:13.400 --> 24:17.359
So if you think we've included
a powerful rear-wheel drive

24:17.360 --> 24:20.039
30-foot long car just in the hope
that it will cause chaos,

24:20.040 --> 24:21.759
get that thought out of your head.

24:21.760 --> 24:26.319
So there we are, then -
the world's most iconic taxis,

24:26.320 --> 24:30.200
each poised and ready to defend
the honour of its country.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.639
Now, the cab drivers.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.359
And naturally, because of the
magnitude of what's at stake here,

24:37.360 --> 24:39.839
each country has sent its very best.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.039
But they all must have got lost
or something, so instead,

24:43.040 --> 24:46.360
we have the usual ragtag bunch
of racing drivers.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.760
For Russia,
touring car legend Anthony Reid.

24:52.920 --> 24:56.680
For South Africa,
touring car legend Matt Jackson.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.880
For Germany,
touring car legend Matt Neal.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.920
For India,
touring car legend Gordon Shedden.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.600
For Mexico,
touring car legend Paul O'Neill.

25:14.160 --> 25:20.199
For America, touring car legend
Tom Chilton.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.039
And in the black cab, me.

25:22.040 --> 25:26.239
So here we are, ready to plunge
once more into the abyss

25:26.240 --> 25:29.600
of motorsport-based
scientific research.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.999
I should point out that it's
the custom for Indian taxi drivers

25:40.000 --> 25:44.399
to carry a figurine of their chosen
God on the dashboard of their car.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.560
I think our guy may have
overdone it a bit.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.880
The guys are getting impatient.
That's good. Five-second board.

26:05.680 --> 26:06.880
Yeah!

26:08.960 --> 26:10.440
The South African is through.

26:11.680 --> 26:16.039
New York taxi alongside,
German... everybody is through.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.760
Absolutely everybody has passed me.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.800
But this is a marathon,
not a sprint.

26:24.760 --> 26:27.719
'As ever, I'd issued strict
instructions

26:27.720 --> 26:30.439
'for the drivers to avoid
body contact.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.200
'Clearly, the South African
hadn't got the memo.'

26:37.200 --> 26:40.920
The South African is completely
insane, largely out of control.

26:48.360 --> 26:51.480
Huge slide from the limo!
That's incredible.

26:52.920 --> 26:56.919
'But while the Russian limo may have
been struggling in the corners,

26:56.920 --> 26:58.400
'I had issues everywhere.'

27:03.480 --> 27:07.319
Yeah. I'm quite badly outpaced
on the hill,

27:07.320 --> 27:10.320
on the straights and in the turns.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.599
This is all I've got.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.040
'However, I had a plan.'

27:16.640 --> 27:21.319
When it comes to cunning, remember,
black cab drivers do The Knowledge.

27:21.320 --> 27:26.679
I know where all the shortcuts are.
I'll nip down here, love.

27:26.680 --> 27:29.759
Thanks to my super tight turning
circle, I can make this.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.479
That's me back in the race.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.040
I'd say more than back in,
I am leading it.

27:35.200 --> 27:39.079
'Sadly, my fellow cabbies weren't
impressed by this tactic

27:39.080 --> 27:41.159
'and when they caught up with me,

27:41.160 --> 27:43.959
'they were quick to show
their displeasure.'

27:43.960 --> 27:48.640
He's just ramming me!
That is just... oh, you're joking.

27:54.480 --> 27:58.880
Yeah. Some good-natured jostling
from the other nations.

28:06.360 --> 28:10.479
'With the race now at the halfway
point, no clear leader was emerging,

28:10.480 --> 28:14.560
'which meant inevitably that the
drivers began to turn up the heat.'

28:23.320 --> 28:25.400
There's been a crash,
but we're OK.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.959
'Fed up of the South African's
hooliganism,

28:30.960 --> 28:33.760
'the limo gave him
a taste of his own medicine.'

28:41.960 --> 28:44.999
Oh! Whoa! Getting a push now.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.960
This is by far the fastest
I have been.

28:50.040 --> 28:55.399
Oh, Jesus. Sorry about that.
Oh, God, it's the Mexican, isn't it?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.760
It's going to be bad.

28:59.840 --> 29:04.400
'With just two laps to go, everybody
was still running. But then...'

29:09.920 --> 29:15.039
Oh, the limo takes
himself off entirely.

29:15.040 --> 29:19.680
Oh, my word!
That is Russia taken out.

29:21.240 --> 29:23.960
In fact, America has taken
itself out as well.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.680
Right, still in play,
we have the Beetle...

29:32.760 --> 29:34.639
The Mercedes is holding up well.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.199
It's really sustained
very little damage.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.120
'But the marauding South African
had other ideas.'

29:44.560 --> 29:47.280
Oh! Bad luck.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.119
'Now into the final lap,

29:50.120 --> 29:55.000
'and desperate to beat the remaining
runners, I took another sneaky turn.'

29:57.240 --> 29:58.640
Ha-ha!

30:03.080 --> 30:04.520
There is the finish line.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.960
I think I can win this.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.280
I think I can win... Oh, no, no!

30:20.480 --> 30:22.960
It's entirely possible
that I am a bit last.

30:25.600 --> 30:29.159
'Nevertheless, the crucible
of motorsport

30:29.160 --> 30:31.919
'had once more given us the answer.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.560
'As it turns out,
the greatest taxi in the world...

30:36.800 --> 30:39.200
'is the Hindustan Ambassador'.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.839
Well done, mate. Excellent.

30:47.840 --> 30:51.280
Excellent. Good science.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.599
But may I ask, Hammond,
an important question?

30:55.600 --> 30:59.839
How many people were killed
in the making of that film?

30:59.840 --> 31:04.719
Actually, only three. - Three. See,
that's more than I was hoping for.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.479
But with science, there often
has to be sacrifice.

31:07.480 --> 31:10.879
But you've decided, have you not,
after subjecting those cars

31:10.880 --> 31:13.439
to the white heat of the crucible
of motorsport,

31:13.440 --> 31:15.639
that the best taxi in the world

31:15.640 --> 31:19.399
started out in life as a Morris
Oxford. - Yeah, and there it is.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.479
That would explain why the company
that makes the London black cab

31:22.480 --> 31:25.239
- has gone bust.
- You say that, but they're back.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.839
They've been rescued. They're going
to start production again very soon.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.319
Pointlessly, as it turns out.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.679
Yes, absolutely.

31:31.680 --> 31:35.519
So, let's put a star in our
brand-new reasonably-priced car.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.479
Now, you may be aware
that later on this year,

31:38.480 --> 31:40.519
we're going to be treated
to a film called Rush.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.639
It's about the epic battle
in 1976

31:42.640 --> 31:45.119
for the Formula One
world championship

31:45.120 --> 31:47.479
between James Hunt and Niki Lauda,

31:47.480 --> 31:50.359
and my guest tonight
is the man who directed it.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.840
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Ron Howard!

31:55.360 --> 31:58.119
Ron Howard is here.

31:58.120 --> 32:01.400
How are you? He's here!

32:05.360 --> 32:07.320
The man who made Rush. Have a seat.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.879
Now, Ron, over the years,

32:10.880 --> 32:15.119
your films have been nominated for
29 Oscars

32:15.120 --> 32:18.599
and I think you've won two yourself.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.919
And now you've made a historical
film

32:20.920 --> 32:24.559
about a sport that most of the world
doesn't really watch.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.319
So why did you think,
"Yeah, Hunt and Lauda"?

32:28.320 --> 32:31.279
Great story.
Great human interest story,

32:31.280 --> 32:35.639
and I knew just enough about Formula
One to just know how cool it was.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.239
And I felt like the combination
of those characters,

32:38.240 --> 32:40.119
the kind of human drama,

32:40.120 --> 32:44.199
the world of Formula One,
particularly in the '70s,

32:44.200 --> 32:46.719
was a chance to offer
something fresh to audiences.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.159
It was a movie I wanted to see.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.319
I was nervous about it
because I thought

32:50.320 --> 32:52.239
oh, no, they'll make it too nerdy

32:52.240 --> 32:54.959
and everyone will say
Formula One's boring,

32:54.960 --> 32:57.759
or they'll do a Hollywood number
of "I love speed!"

32:57.760 --> 32:59.479
and it will all be set in NASCAR

32:59.480 --> 33:02.239
to make it easy for the Americans
to understand.

33:02.240 --> 33:06.399
And yet,
it's neither of those things.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.439
It is genuinely a film
that takes you back to the '70s,

33:09.440 --> 33:11.799
when motor racing
was bloody dangerous.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.159
You weren't the only one
who was nervous.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.199
You certainly want the fans to feel
the sport's respected,

33:17.200 --> 33:20.879
but you also need to make a movie
that works on a lot of levels

33:20.880 --> 33:22.119
for a lot of people.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.319
I had that opportunity
with Apollo 13,

33:25.320 --> 33:27.639
and it's one of the films
I enjoyed making most.

33:27.640 --> 33:30.399
And I've got to tell you,
Rush was right up there.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.479
I had a blast.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.799
We've got a clip for those of you
who want to see what it looks like.

33:34.800 --> 33:38.080
We'll show it for you now,
because it is quite something.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.719
There's a lie that all drivers
tell themselves.

33:42.720 --> 33:46.079
"Death is something that happens
to other people."

33:46.080 --> 33:50.160
What kind of person does a job
like this? Each year, two of us die.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.759
I accept every time I get in my car

33:53.760 --> 33:56.199
that there's a 20% chance
I could die.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.519
Being driven round at 170 mph?
This thing's a bomb on wheels.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.920
- I'm quicker than all of you.
- Then let's race.

34:12.560 --> 34:16.719
I'm a world champion on the verge
to become world champion again.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.600
I could beat this guy. Trust me.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.639
The closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.719
This lot are going
to wet themselves.

34:35.719 --> 34:41.039
In the film, you show Niki Lauda,
warts and all.

34:41.040 --> 34:45.119
I had no idea he was like that,
this OCD, very straight guy.

34:45.120 --> 34:48.039
How did he react
when he saw the finished product?

34:48.040 --> 34:50.879
When he saw it, he was moved by it,

34:50.880 --> 34:55.319
and I think it was because
he never really had a perspective

34:55.320 --> 34:57.439
on that period around the accident.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.439
First of all, he couldn't remember
much of it.

35:00.440 --> 35:04.239
Secondly, what he does remember was
all about the anger that people were

35:04.240 --> 35:06.239
writing him off, thought he had
died.

35:06.240 --> 35:10.719
He could hear that. And also the
myopic drive to get back in the car.

35:10.720 --> 35:14.279
He was so single-minded that he
blanked everything else out

35:14.280 --> 35:17.399
and when he saw this he began to
realise what other

35:17.400 --> 35:21.519
people around him, Marlene, his wife
then, in particular,

35:21.520 --> 35:24.159
what they were going through,
and a more human side of it.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.519
And I think it was emotional for him
to deal with.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.079
Then of course you've got James Hunt

35:28.080 --> 35:29.879
as the complete counterbalance
to that.

35:29.880 --> 35:34.039
We've got a picture of James Hunt
which we keep on our office wall.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.479
This just sums him up.
His pop-riveted car.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.679
He's thinking,
"When I've finished this cigarette

35:38.680 --> 35:41.360
"and this can of beer,
you, my dear, are next."

35:43.400 --> 35:45.839
You just don't see this today. It is
one of the tragedies.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.399
You can't see Nico Rosberg posing.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.799
"I would like to thank my
watch manufacturer

35:49.800 --> 35:52.479
"and my hat manufacturer
and the people who made my oil."

35:52.480 --> 35:53.999
That's what I really like about it.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.599
There are two guys,
who bowed to no-one.

35:56.600 --> 36:01.199
There was no Yoda guiding them to
their higher purpose.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.519
These were guys who defined
themselves on their own terms,

36:04.520 --> 36:10.479
very different terms,
and they would bear the scars

36:10.480 --> 36:14.079
of those decisions, but they also
could certainly claim the triumphs.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.079
I'm sure everybody in the room
here... We move off Rush.

36:17.080 --> 36:20.799
I'm sure everybody in the room here
is looking at you thinking,

36:20.800 --> 36:24.199
everyone over 40 that is,
thinking that is a familiar face,

36:24.200 --> 36:28.079
because a lot of people don't
realise that you were in Happy Days.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.399
You are Richie Cunningham.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.880
I was him.

36:37.800 --> 36:40.559
It's one of those things I think
people find hard to equate.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.719
Here's this amazing film director,
but you were,

36:43.720 --> 36:46.639
so you really did obviously switch
into directing and I was just

36:46.640 --> 36:49.599
making a list of the better-known
ones that you've directed and...

36:49.600 --> 36:50.839
This is extraordinary.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.639
It's Splash, Cocoon, Apollo 13,
Da Vinci Code, Beautiful Mind,

36:53.640 --> 36:55.399
Frost/Nixon, Angels & Demons,

36:55.400 --> 36:59.479
Backdraft, Parenthood -
that's very funny - Ransom.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.799
I'm just thinking, "Hang on a
minute, he did Happy Days and all

37:02.800 --> 37:07.919
"that. I do a car show and I'm
flat-out." How do you find the time?

37:07.920 --> 37:12.079
The simple answer is I enjoy what
I'm doing, so I don't need a hobby.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.279
I love this.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.799
Having been on a show like Happy
Days, you sort of are doing

37:15.800 --> 37:17.359
the same character over and over

37:17.360 --> 37:21.159
and when I realised I had a chance
to be a director I thought,

37:21.160 --> 37:24.359
"I want to do as many diverse
things as I possibly can."

37:24.360 --> 37:26.279
So I was renting 16mm cameras,

37:26.280 --> 37:28.879
making my own little
independent movies.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.559
Eventually doing my first movie,
which was a car movie,

37:31.560 --> 37:34.039
- Grand Theft Auto. - Of course.
- Car crash comedy.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.879
I did that during one
of the hiatuses from Happy Days.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.919
Moving onto personal life if I may,
four children? - Yes.

37:41.920 --> 37:46.359
- Their middle names interest me.
- Oh, yeah, I guess they might.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.119
You've got one called, middle
name of Dallas. - Yes.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.839
Which I believe was named... - After
the city. - Where...?

37:51.840 --> 37:54.199
She was conceived. Yes.

37:54.200 --> 37:58.039
Then you've got twins, both of whom
have the middle name Carlyle.

37:58.040 --> 38:03.119
Yes. In New York there is a
lovely hotel called The Carlyle...

38:03.120 --> 38:04.560
OK. And...

38:06.120 --> 38:11.199
And we sorted that one out, kind
of backtracked, and thought,

38:11.200 --> 38:15.359
"That's a very beautiful middle
name, let's keep the tradition." - OK.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.159
- The youngest son is called Cross.
- Cross. Reed Cross Howard.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.039
We sort of found out
we were pregnant again. Great.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.239
"All right, well let's sort
through it.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.600
"I wonder if we can figure it out.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.240
"Volvo is not much of a middle
name."

38:34.440 --> 38:38.799
And... - Yeah, Volvo doesn't work.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.759
But there is a road near us called
Lower Cross Road.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.800
Which is where the Volvo was.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.919
- We have a good marriage. - Evidently.
- Richard Hammond does the same.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.999
I was talking to his kids
the other day.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.720
They're called Bus Stop
and By The Bins.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.719
Now, you are the first person to
properly drive our brand-new

39:01.720 --> 39:03.079
reasonably-priced car.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.959
- Yes.
- What did you think of it?

39:04.960 --> 39:07.119
First of all I will say
the right-hand drive

39:07.120 --> 39:10.719
and the gearshift on the left
was a concern to me.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.040
The correct way round.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.719
It was... It definitely threw me.

39:16.720 --> 39:21.439
And I also implore, before you get
into all this, I implore anyone who

39:21.440 --> 39:26.320
has any interest in seeing my movie
Rush, I didn't drive in the movie.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.959
Real drivers drove in the movie.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.559
Right, there's
your excuses out of the way.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.799
Now who'd like to see Ron's lap?

39:34.800 --> 39:36.599
Yes.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.519
- Let's have a look.
- Oh, Lord.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.839
Let's have a look.

39:40.840 --> 39:45.159
Look at that mighty machine leaping
off the line.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.279
You've got to stick it, Ron.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.599
You've got to really stick it.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.199
Niki was giving me a little
coaching the other day.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.959
That's Niki Lauda's explanation.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.519
"You've got to stick it.
You've got to really stick it."

39:55.520 --> 39:58.839
Holy smokes. - Is that sticking it?

39:58.840 --> 40:02.079
- I don't know!
- Not using all the track.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.480
Smooth.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.919
Right. - I don't know.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.160
That car is gripping quite well
there.

40:11.760 --> 40:14.319
This is the one that
always destroys me.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.879
The fearsome Hammerhead.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.159
I look like I'm being destroyed,
don't I?

40:18.160 --> 40:22.359
This is looking good.
That's very good. Very tidy.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.960
Listen to that engine

40:26.040 --> 40:30.839
- Wow, what a machine this is
- Concentrate here a little bit.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.279
See, I'm taking it seriously.

40:32.280 --> 40:35.439
You were. That is
a man who is concentrating.

40:35.440 --> 40:40.759
Tyres tortured as he goes through
the follow-through. Nicely done.

40:40.760 --> 40:43.399
Nicely cut. Let's have a
look at the second-to-last corner.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.879
This is the bit normally catch...
Oh! Bang on.

40:47.880 --> 40:54.279
And then on into Gambon and look
at that grip. That's bloody good.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.999
There we are across the line.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.200
Wow.

41:03.640 --> 41:09.919
Thank you. - So, Ron,
not many times on the board.

41:09.920 --> 41:12.959
- Where do you think you've come?
- Lord.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.119
It wasn't quite as ugly as
I imagined it would be.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.479
My director's eye on the outside had
it looking pretty bad.

41:18.480 --> 41:21.839
It looked smooth. Not sure about
fast, but it looked smooth.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.279
Where do we think?

41:24.280 --> 41:27.839
I'd like to think I'm not
flat on the bottom.

41:27.840 --> 41:30.199
That would be Mike Rutherford
out of Genesis.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.959
I suspect I'm right down there.

41:32.960 --> 41:36.679
That's where I think. - Ron Howard,
you did it in 1...

41:36.680 --> 41:39.399
Right. - So that's good. - OK.

41:39.400 --> 41:44.920
- ..40. - Oh, OK, not the very bottom.
- So that's good. - OK.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.199
The next bit's not so good.

41:48.200 --> 41:48.700
..9.9.

41:54.400 --> 41:58.400
OK. You're not the bottom.

42:01.440 --> 42:07.959
So what this means is we've finally
found something

42:07.960 --> 42:10.119
you can't do.

42:10.120 --> 42:14.759
Good at directing,
brilliant in Happy Days,

42:14.760 --> 42:18.319
a charming human being,
but utterly crap at driving.

42:18.320 --> 42:21.680
Fair enough. - Ladies and gentlemen,
Ron Howard. - Thank you.

42:32.800 --> 42:37.079
Now you may have seen that a few
months ago

42:37.080 --> 42:40.999
the famous BBC TV Centre
closed down.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.719
When it did, the airwaves were
swamped with emotional

42:43.720 --> 42:45.999
tributes from the giants
of television.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.559
Ronnie Corbett, David
Attenborough, Michael Parkinson.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.400
But nothing from Top Gear.
Until now.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.840
This is the building in question.

43:01.400 --> 43:05.639
For 53 years, it was the engine
room for some of the most iconic

43:05.640 --> 43:07.240
television in the world.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.360
But now, today,
this is all that's left.

43:16.680 --> 43:19.399
And that is great news

43:19.400 --> 43:22.039
because what we've realised is that
once you take away all

43:22.040 --> 43:25.519
the people and the tea trolley
and you've locked all the doors

43:25.520 --> 43:30.719
this abandoned building makes
an excellent venue for a race.

43:30.720 --> 43:34.279
You have these curving corridors
that could be long, fast

43:34.280 --> 43:36.240
sweepers on a top F1 track.

43:37.560 --> 43:40.439
You have these beautiful offices
full of interesting obstacles

43:40.440 --> 43:42.480
and technical turns.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.399
And you have all this outdoor area
where you can literally

43:47.400 --> 43:49.480
get some air.

43:51.280 --> 43:55.359
All in all, a unique and exciting
racing circuit I think you'll agree.

43:55.360 --> 43:57.639
And so to the racers.

43:57.640 --> 44:01.399
Now, unfortunately this building
isn't very suitable for cars,

44:01.400 --> 44:04.959
as indeed Jeremy proved a
while back with the Peel P50.

44:04.960 --> 44:11.159
So today we'll be racing these two.
Of which there are three.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.559
We have Dougie Lampkin MBE,

44:14.560 --> 44:18.240
a trials rider with 16 World
Titles to his name.

44:20.240 --> 44:24.119
And he's up against Tim Shieff
and Paul Joseph,

44:24.120 --> 44:26.959
two of the finest Free
Runners on the planet.

44:26.960 --> 44:30.359
They may not have an
engine between them

44:30.360 --> 44:33.439
but apparently they can
run along corridors and scamper over

44:33.440 --> 44:38.039
balconies and fire escapes
like a couple of randy squirrels.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.319
So with the introductions over,
let's look at the route

44:41.320 --> 44:42.520
of the race itself.

44:43.560 --> 44:46.399
Here we have a birds' eye
view of Television Centre.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.199
It's actually only a model.

44:48.200 --> 44:51.439
And you will see it's shaped
a little bit like a question mark.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.919
So what I'm proposing is
we start here, which is

44:53.920 --> 44:55.719
roughly where we're standing now,

44:55.720 --> 44:58.279
enter the building at the base of
the question mark

44:58.280 --> 45:00.999
and then race all the way
through it to finish here

45:01.000 --> 45:04.640
which is up there.

45:07.360 --> 45:09.839
'As an excited crowd gathered,
I positioned

45:09.840 --> 45:11.400
'myself on the finish line.'

45:13.280 --> 45:19.600
Are you ready? In three, two,
one.

45:33.960 --> 45:38.199
This is interesting. Dougie Lampkin
has chosen to go through the door.

45:38.200 --> 45:42.159
'But the youths are making their way
up the outside of the building

45:42.160 --> 45:43.839
'which actually isn't such a bad
idea'

45:43.840 --> 45:47.639
because once you're inside here,
you will be completely baffled.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.839
'If they stay on the outside they
will have some idea

45:49.840 --> 45:50.999
'of where they're going.'

45:51.000 --> 45:52.560
Good thinking.

45:58.440 --> 46:02.239
Right, this should allow me to get
a direct feed

46:02.240 --> 46:06.199
from any of the
CCTV cameras around the building.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.840
And there are the jumpy boys.

46:09.320 --> 46:12.000
They are literally breaking news.

46:23.160 --> 46:25.639
'As the youths made their way
through the newsroom,

46:25.640 --> 46:28.080
'Dougie was looking for a way
upstairs.'

46:31.680 --> 46:33.200
There is Dougie Lampkin.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.919
'In the Newsnight office, the youths
had found their path blocked

46:38.920 --> 46:41.240
'and were having to
make their way down again.'

47:03.680 --> 47:07.479
'Having found himself literally in a
lock-in in the BBC bar

47:07.480 --> 47:10.800
'Dougie too needed to find a way
back down.'

47:19.360 --> 47:23.239
So he is, God knows,
somewhere over in the main

47:23.240 --> 47:26.440
leg of the question mark just
approaching the curvy bit.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.960
I've no idea who's in the lead,
but it's very exciting.

47:35.880 --> 47:37.680
'That, chaps, is a locked door.'

47:42.160 --> 47:44.479
The Health and Safety department
will have something to

47:44.480 --> 47:45.840
say about that.

47:52.800 --> 47:56.319
Into the studio and the Daleks still
waiting

47:56.320 --> 47:58.120
at the bottom of the stairs
there.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.519
'Amazingly even though the youths
were now at the management

48:05.520 --> 48:07.279
'offices on the sixth floor

48:07.280 --> 48:10.080
'they were having no trouble
making decisions.'

48:19.840 --> 48:23.279
'Meanwhile Dougie, now completely
frustrated by the maze

48:23.280 --> 48:27.520
'of BBC corridors, had
decided on a more direct approach.'

48:29.680 --> 48:31.360
Oh.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.840
And Dougie Lampkin is going onto
the roof I believe.

49:21.440 --> 49:23.080
I can hear a bike.

49:37.960 --> 49:40.999
It's Dougie Lampkin,
ladies and gentlemen!

49:41.000 --> 49:43.759
What a fantastic two-wheeled
tribute

49:43.760 --> 49:46.239
to BBC Television Centre
W12 8QT.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.839
Congratulations, sir.

49:47.840 --> 49:49.959
Where are the Free Runners?

49:49.960 --> 49:51.879
And here they come.

49:51.880 --> 49:54.839
Tim Shieff, Paul Joseph, close,

49:54.840 --> 49:57.079
not quite close enough,

49:57.080 --> 49:58.719
but well done anyway.

49:58.720 --> 50:02.239
Well done, great race. - Your victor,
Dougie Lampkin. How was it?

50:02.240 --> 50:05.159
I'm knackered.
That thing's a labyrinth.

50:05.160 --> 50:08.119
You know there's a lift?
In that tall bit there.

50:08.120 --> 50:10.040
You just go straight up to the top.

50:14.880 --> 50:19.679
That was incredible. I couldn't do
a single thing that those guys did.

50:19.680 --> 50:22.559
I was going to do the bike.
I couldn't put the helmet on.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.279
The jumps were amazing.

50:24.280 --> 50:28.399
I just want to say that
when I made that film

50:28.400 --> 50:33.079
Television Centre had closed, but
since then, owing to the unique way

50:33.080 --> 50:36.640
the BBC is run,
they've decided to open it again.

50:37.960 --> 50:42.360
Right, so you've made a tribute film
to a building that isn't shut? - Yes.

50:43.960 --> 50:47.679
Isn't that like making an obituary
for Holly Willoughby? - Yes.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.479
But imagine how pleased you'd be

50:49.480 --> 50:51.239
when you found out
she was still alive.

50:51.240 --> 50:54.519
That's a point. - Chaps,
may I interrupt?

50:54.520 --> 50:57.439
Because I much enjoyed your
smashing-up-the-taxi film

50:57.440 --> 50:59.559
and your race
between the motorcyclist

50:59.560 --> 51:02.999
and the two pedestrians, but I'm
afraid we have to get serious now.

51:03.000 --> 51:07.039
- Because we've had a letter.
- Oh, no - It's from...

51:07.040 --> 51:09.720
Well, it's from a mealy-mouthed,
small-minded idiot.

51:11.080 --> 51:14.959
And it says, "Dear Jeremy Clarkson,
because Britain is so crowded

51:14.960 --> 51:18.559
"and there's so much traffic,
there's no point owning a Ferrari

51:18.560 --> 51:21.960
"and therefore no point road
testing them on your programme."

51:24.040 --> 51:26.879
Well, now I disagree,
Mr Small-minded Idiot.

51:26.880 --> 51:29.959
Because there are plenty of places
in Britain

51:29.960 --> 51:31.440
that aren't crowded at all.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.759
This is Hertfordshire.

51:42.760 --> 51:47.040
It's just 40 miles from London
and it's motoring nirvana.

51:51.720 --> 51:53.879
Mmm! We have everything we need.

51:53.880 --> 51:57.999
Huge scenery, swooping road,
no traffic.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.839
The Holy Trinity for anyone whose
communion wine comes with

52:01.840 --> 52:03.680
an octane rating.

52:04.680 --> 52:08.640
Can't enjoy a Ferrari in Britain?
Oh, yes, you can.

52:10.080 --> 52:12.880
But can you enjoy THIS one?

52:18.960 --> 52:21.279
It's called the F12.

52:21.280 --> 52:26.959
It costs £240,000 and thanks to
a 730 horsepower V12 it's

52:26.960 --> 52:31.320
the most powerful road-going
Ferrari ever made.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.800
It's almost as powerful, in fact, as
Fernando Alonso's Formula 1 racer.

52:45.920 --> 52:49.799
Of course, at this point, people
with mouths of meal would say,

52:49.800 --> 52:53.640
"What's the point of all that
when we've got speed limits?"

52:55.200 --> 52:58.359
You don't have to use
all of it all the time.

52:58.360 --> 53:01.999
In a town, you can sit back,
turn on the radio,

53:02.000 --> 53:06.399
put the suspension in bumpy road
mode to make everything nice

53:06.400 --> 53:08.519
and comfy, set the gearbox in
automatic,

53:08.520 --> 53:10.159
the air conditioning just so,

53:10.160 --> 53:13.720
and then you can drive along quite
happily at 20 miles an hour.

53:15.160 --> 53:18.760
Easy. 'It's not even
especially big.'

53:20.680 --> 53:23.119
I'm not saying this is tiny,

53:23.120 --> 53:26.480
but it's not preposterous. You don't
go through every gap like that.

53:28.600 --> 53:32.599
So this car works in Letchworth
just like any other car.

53:32.600 --> 53:39.080
But when the built-up area ends,
it's not like any other car at all.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.280
Wow. Wow, this is fast.

54:02.080 --> 54:07.639
Ferrari say it will
go from 0 to 60 in 3.1 seconds.

54:07.640 --> 54:11.440
And that flat-out, it will be
doing 211 miles an hour.

54:12.760 --> 54:17.400
And it's not just the massive engine
which makes it all so savage.

54:19.560 --> 54:23.759
Unlike the old 599, this has
a double clutch gearbox,

54:23.760 --> 54:26.359
so gear changes are immediate.

54:26.360 --> 54:29.399
You build up the speed
until the noise gets too much

54:29.400 --> 54:31.799
and your ears are bleeding
and then you change up

54:31.800 --> 54:35.880
and there's no gap. How do
you do that?

54:39.560 --> 54:42.839
They've also fitted a more
sophisticated traction

54:42.840 --> 54:47.800
control system which lets you have
fun without allowing you to crash.

54:53.440 --> 54:58.240
But the most impressive thing is how
this car manages the air.

55:01.840 --> 55:05.759
These flaps down here,
when the brakes are hot, they open,

55:05.760 --> 55:09.399
to allow cooling air to
pass on to the discs.

55:09.400 --> 55:13.279
But the rest of the time, they're
shut for better aerodynamics.

55:13.280 --> 55:16.559
And then you have these channels
on either side of the bonnet.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.519
The air is funnelled along them

55:18.520 --> 55:21.919
into here and out of here
so it provides a boundary

55:21.920 --> 55:25.639
layer of smooth air passing down the
flanks of the car

55:25.640 --> 55:27.439
making it more slippery.

55:27.440 --> 55:29.399
There's real downforce as well.

55:29.400 --> 55:32.679
At 125 miles an hour,
the weight of the air

55:32.680 --> 55:36.399
pressing down on the car
is 19 stone.

55:36.400 --> 55:40.319
That's like having half
of John Prescott on the roof forcing

55:40.320 --> 55:43.280
the tyres into the Tarmac,
giving better grip.

55:45.840 --> 55:49.639
They have done everything
in the book to exploit

55:49.640 --> 55:52.199
the colossal firepower.

55:52.200 --> 55:55.280
And the results are mesmerising.

55:59.840 --> 56:04.119
In the past, big Ferraris felt big.

56:04.120 --> 56:09.880
The Testarossa, the 612, they were
immense. They were fat-boy cars.

56:10.960 --> 56:14.519
This isn't. This is light
and nimble and sharp.

56:14.520 --> 56:17.920
It's... It is spectacular.

56:25.920 --> 56:29.239
I must confess though that
while the car is fine,

56:29.240 --> 56:34.720
I am struggling, because
it is a bit frantic in here.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.840
I just went airborne then.

56:45.920 --> 56:49.599
You read about those early test
pilots in Mach Two

56:49.600 --> 56:54.559
jet fighters going to the very
limits of what was possible.

56:54.560 --> 56:58.360
That's what it feels like in this -
like you're sort of out of control.

57:05.520 --> 57:09.799
And it has incredibly fast steering,
so the slightest movement

57:09.800 --> 57:13.120
of the wheel causes an immediate
dart one way or the other.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.919
And then there's the throttle.

57:16.920 --> 57:19.199
You put your foot down
and you think, "Whoa, yes,"

57:19.200 --> 57:23.200
and then immediately you think,
"No, actually. Too scary."

57:29.960 --> 57:33.399
And when life is as hectic as this,
what you really

57:33.400 --> 57:37.359
want are for all the controls
to be conventional.

57:37.360 --> 57:38.759
And they're not.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.359
All the knobs and buttons
for the lights and the wipers

57:41.360 --> 57:43.799
and the indicators are all
on the steering wheel

57:43.800 --> 57:47.280
which moves about, so they're never
where you left them.

57:48.520 --> 57:51.359
You can't even sneeze
when you're driving this car

57:51.360 --> 57:54.640
because if you did... Well, they'd
have to hose you off the road.

57:58.280 --> 58:00.279
To try and explain
what I'm on about,

58:00.280 --> 58:02.400
I've come to this tennis court.

58:08.680 --> 58:14.159
This is what it's like to drive
an ordinary car

58:14.160 --> 58:16.680
on the roads of Hertfordshire.

58:18.360 --> 58:20.480
There you go, Golf GTI...

58:22.040 --> 58:26.519
BMW M3, Ferrari 458. This is easy

58:26.520 --> 58:29.519
and manageable

58:29.520 --> 58:32.119
and I could do it all day.

58:32.120 --> 58:38.959
Now let me show you what
it's like to drive

58:38.960 --> 58:41.240
a Ferrari F12.

58:44.120 --> 58:51.320
Ugh! Ugh! Oh, in the face!

59:09.600 --> 59:13.679
The Stig says, this is the only
car in the world that can hold

59:13.680 --> 59:16.439
a candle to the Lexus LFA.

59:16.440 --> 59:19.759
He also says it's the first Ferrari
he's ever driven that he

59:19.760 --> 59:21.479
would actually buy -

59:21.480 --> 59:24.760
if he had any concept of money,
which of course he doesn't.

59:26.840 --> 59:30.599
Me, though... It is brilliant,

59:30.600 --> 59:34.799
but I think it would be better still
if it had slower steering...

59:34.800 --> 59:39.720
and it's hard for me to say this,
but a bit less power.

59:42.320 --> 59:45.839
Yes, you can really enjoy it
in Britain,

59:45.840 --> 59:49.680
but you can't really enjoy
all of it.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.119
It is frantic.
I'd still have an LFA.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.279
The LFA is 100 grand more

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.199
although the options on this,

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.839
they do take it up to 350 as well.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.799
Hang on, hang on, hang on. - What?

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.719
Did I just hear you,
Jeremy Clarkson,

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.559
say that you'd like "a bit less
power"? - Yes, you did.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.439
Isn't that a bit like Gordon Ramsay
saying, "Yes, I like this dish,

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.159
"but I wish it had a bit less
flavour."

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.439
Or James May saying,
"Yes, I like this, but can it be

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.679
"a bit less brown?"

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:42.399
No, it is like that, but it is a
bombshell, which means we can end.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.479
Thank you very much for watching.
See you all next week. Take care.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.760
Good night.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.760
