YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:02.940 --> 20:05.465
YEAH. I KNEW
YOU HAD MY BACK.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.293
DINAH: OLIVER!

20:09.425 --> 20:10.687
CAMERAMAN: LOOK...

20:10.731 --> 20:12.472
SHE'’S HURT BAD.

20:12.515 --> 20:15.257
IT'’S OK.
YOU'’RE GONNA BE OK.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.477
HE'’S--HE'S COMING.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.957
HE'’S COMING
FOR YOU, OLIVER.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.489
HEY, HEY. YOU HUNGRY?

20:29.532 --> 20:31.186
WE'’VE STILL GOT
HALF A PIZZA LEFT,

20:31.230 --> 20:32.666
AND SOMEBODY'’S
GOTTA EAT IT.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.407
-THANKS, DAD.
-OF COURSE.

20:34.450 --> 20:35.364
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

20:35.408 --> 20:36.670
WHO'’S THAT?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.933
IT'’S PROBABLY YOUR
AUNT DINAH

20:38.976 --> 20:40.935
COMING HERE TO LECTURE ME
ABOUT SOMETHING.

20:40.978 --> 20:44.025
I SWEAR, SHE TREATS ME
LIKE A KID OR SOMETHING.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.722
WELL, IF YOU JUST
LISTEN TO HER.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.682
IF YOU TAKE HER SIDE,
I TAKE BACK THAT PIZZA.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.512
HI. IS ZOE HOME?

20:52.555 --> 20:54.949
YEAH. YEAH, SHE IS.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.430
I DIDN'’T KNOW YOU
WERE BACK IN TOWN.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.170
JUST FOR A FEW DAYS.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.521
YOUR FOLKS KNOW
YOU'’RE HERE?

21:01.564 --> 21:02.957
I'’M NOT 7.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.308
HEY, WILL. DAD,
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.179
I TEXTED WILL ABOUT
MY GEOGRAPHY HOMEWORK.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.833
HE SAID HE'’D COME
OVER TO HELP.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.531
IS IT OK IF WE WORK
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

21:11.574 --> 21:13.750
I DIDN'’T REALIZE
THAT YOU TWO WERE--

21:13.794 --> 21:15.491
AHEM--YOU KNOW.

21:15.535 --> 21:16.492
FRIENDS?

21:16.536 --> 21:17.537
YEAH.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.060
FELICITY SET UP
AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME

21:19.103 --> 21:20.540
SO I COULD TEXT ZOE
WHILE I WAS AWAY.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.019
I DIDN'’T KNOW THAT.
WHY DIDN'’T I KNOW THAT?

21:22.063 --> 21:23.456
HOW COME YOU DIDN'’T
TELL ME?

21:23.499 --> 21:24.631
IT'’S JUST TEXTING, DAD.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.198
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, SURE, YEAH.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.766
UM, YOU GUYS CAN HAVE
THE LIVING ROOM.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.334
I'’LL BE IN
THE NEXT ROOM...

21:32.378 --> 21:35.206
CLEANING MY GUN.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.560
DON'’T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HOW'’S IT BEING BACK HOME?

21:40.603 --> 21:42.257
SUCKS.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.347
GUYS WITH CAMERAS
ARE FOLLOWING MY DAD
AND FELICITY EVERYWHERE.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.002
AND THAT'’S
WHAT'’S BOTHERING YOU?

21:48.045 --> 21:50.004
WE'’VE ONLY GOT
ABOUT 3 MINUTES

21:50.047 --> 21:51.745
BEFORE MY DAD FINDS
AN EXCUSE TO CHECK ON US.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.399
WHAT'’S WRONG?

21:53.442 --> 21:54.922
YOU TELL SOME GIRL
YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON HER

21:54.965 --> 21:56.532
AND SHE DIDN'’T
LIKE YOU BACK?

21:56.576 --> 21:58.012
SORT OF.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.840
COOL. WHAT'’S HER NAME?

21:59.883 --> 22:01.581
IT'’S NOT THAT.

22:01.624 --> 22:04.279
THEN WHAT IS IT?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.412
I DON'’T KNOW.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.022
I THINK YOU DO KNOW.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.806
YOU JUST DON'’T WANT
TO TELL ME.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.331
MAYBE IT'’S NOT
THE WORST THING.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.811
MY DAD AND AUNT DINAH
FIGHT INSTEAD OF TALK.

22:14.855 --> 22:17.466
PROMISE ME WE'’LL
NEVER BE LIKE THAT.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.599
YOU GOT IT.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.601
MIND IF I HANG HERE
FOR A FEW HOURS?

22:21.644 --> 22:23.429
I REALLY DO NOT
WANT TO GO BACK HOME.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.561
OK. WE SHOULD PROBABLY
OPEN THAT GEOGRAPHY BOOK.

22:25.605 --> 22:28.608
YEAH.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.261
GET UP. GO.

22:30.305 --> 22:32.481
CURTIS: WHAT'’S THAT MEAN,
"HE'’S COMING FOR YOU"?

22:32.525 --> 22:33.743
WELL,
THIS CHIMERA--

22:33.787 --> 22:35.266
I'’M REALLY GLAD THAT
NAME'’S CATCHING ON.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.268
HEY, HE'’S
HUNTING VIGILANTES.

22:37.312 --> 22:41.142
SO HE'’S LIKE
AN ANTI-VIGILANTE VIGILANTE.

22:41.185 --> 22:42.839
JOHN: MORE LIKE A PREDATOR
OR A LION TRYING

22:42.883 --> 22:44.537
TO TAKE DOWN THE BIGGEST
IN THE JUNGLE.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.408
DINAH: THAT'’S QUITE A LEAP.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.279
TELL THAT TO RENE,
WHO WAS NEARLY CUT
IN HALF,

22:48.323 --> 22:50.238
HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR THE KEVLAR,
OR RORY OR HELENA,

22:50.281 --> 22:52.283
NEITHER
OF WHICH WE CAN GET
IN CONTACT WITH.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.851
OLIVER AND I
CAME ACROSS THIS
COLLECTION OF MASKS

22:54.895 --> 22:57.114
IN CHIMERA'’S
UNDERGROUND LAIR.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.508
HE HAD THEM ALL
ON DISPLAY,

22:59.552 --> 23:01.336
ALMOST LIKE
TROPHIES.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.859
ANY WORD?

23:02.903 --> 23:05.427
OLIVER: BEST GUESS IS THAT
SHE HAS A CONCUSSION

23:05.471 --> 23:07.124
AND A COUPLE OF
BROKEN RIBS.

23:07.168 --> 23:10.563
THEY'’RE HAVING DR. SCHWARTZ
EXAMINE HER DISCREETLY.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.652
DINAH: DID SHE GIVE YOU
ANY INTEL ON CHIMERA?

23:12.695 --> 23:15.045
IS THAT WHAT
WE'’RE CALLING IT?

23:15.089 --> 23:17.308
I CAN ONLY HOPE. I MEAN,
IT'’D BE NICE. HEH! AHEM.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.833
NO, SHE WAS
IN TOO MUCH PAIN TO SPEAK.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.138
OLIVER: MEANWHILE.
JOHN: MEANWHILE...

23:21.182 --> 23:22.662
YOU'’RE NEXT ON
CHIMERA'’S LIST.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.446
SO I CAN'’T THINK OF
A WORSE IDEA

23:24.490 --> 23:26.405
THAN GOING OUT
AS GREEN ARROW DURING
POLLARD'’S TOWN HALL.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.319
EXCEPT MAYBE SHOWING UP
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.234
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TELL POLLARD THAT
YOU'’RE NOT COMING.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.454
I THINK THAT'’S DINAH'S JOB.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.674
GREAT.

23:34.717 --> 23:37.154
SCHWARTZ: EXCUSE ME.
UH, WHERE IS SHE?

23:37.198 --> 23:38.460
WHAT?

23:38.504 --> 23:40.680
YOUR GREEN-HOODED FRIEND.
SHE'’S NOT IN HER ROOM.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.029
OLIVER: OH, FOR GOD'’S SAKES.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.510
WELL, DID WE REALLY EXPECT
HER TO STICK AROUND?

23:44.553 --> 23:47.643
NO.

24:03.616 --> 24:04.660
IT'’S JUST ME.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.357
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:06.401 --> 24:08.490
CAPTAIN DRAKE TOLD ME
YOU BAILED
AT THE HOSPITAL.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.361
I JUST CAME TO
CHECK UP ON YOU.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.841
LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.930
I CAN MANAGE ON MY OWN.

24:13.974 --> 24:16.150
YOU ARE SO STUBBORN.

24:16.193 --> 24:19.370
YOU SURE
YOU AND OLIVER
AREN'’T RELATED?

24:20.546 --> 24:23.723
[SIGHS]

24:23.766 --> 24:26.726
ACTUALLY, WE ARE.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.728
HE'’S MY HALF-BROTHER.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.730
HA HA! THAT'’S FUNNY.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.993
I'’M NOT JOKING.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.998
ROBERT QUEEN WAS MY FATHER.

24:40.348 --> 24:43.394
SO WHEN YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER,

24:43.438 --> 24:46.528
YOU KIND OF
LEFT OUT A PRETTY
IMPORTANT DETAIL.

24:46.572 --> 24:50.532
ROBERT WAS OUT OF
THE PICTURE LONG BEFORE.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.752
I DIDN'’T WANT TO
TELL YOU

24:52.795 --> 24:55.755
BECAUSE I DIDN'’T WANT
TO RISK CHANGING THINGS.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.758
CHANGING
WHAT THINGS?

24:58.801 --> 25:02.762
YOU AND ME WORKING TOGETHER.

25:02.805 --> 25:05.199
WHY WOULD IT?

25:05.242 --> 25:07.767
OLIVER'’S GOT HIS THING,
AND WE'’VE GOT OUR THING.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.509
RIGHT?

25:11.814 --> 25:15.426
YEAH, WE DO.

25:22.825 --> 25:25.480
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, MS. MAYOR...

25:25.524 --> 25:26.786
FOR NOTHING.

25:26.829 --> 25:27.917
[HANGS UP]

25:27.961 --> 25:29.789
WE HAVE A NEW PROBLEM.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.442
DON'’T WE ALWAYS?

25:31.486 --> 25:33.488
DINAH, BEFORE
WE GET TO THAT,

25:33.532 --> 25:36.447
THERE'’S SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOU ABOUT,

25:36.491 --> 25:38.667
SOMETHING I'’VE BEEN
KEEPING FROM YOU.

25:38.711 --> 25:42.236
WELL, THAT IS PAR FOR
THE COURSE WITH YOU, OLIVER.

25:42.279 --> 25:44.020
THAT'’S A FAIR POINT.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.805
IN THIS INSTANCE,

25:45.848 --> 25:47.807
I JUST--I NEEDED
SOME TIME

25:47.850 --> 25:49.809
TO PROCESS
THE INFORMATION

25:49.852 --> 25:51.811
BEFORE I SHARED IT
WITH EVERYONE.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.595
WHAT INFORMATION?

25:53.639 --> 25:55.815
THE NEW GREEN ARROW
IS MY HALF-SISTER.

25:55.858 --> 26:00.515
SHE'’S THE PRODUCT
OF AN AFFAIR THAT
MY FATHER HAD.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.473
WOW.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.258
HA HA!
I WASN'’T EXPECTING THAT.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.955
I REALLY HOPE YOU
CAN APPRECIATE

26:05.999 --> 26:07.696
WHY I NEEDED
SOME TIME WITH THIS.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.132
SURE. YEAH.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.743
I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.440
I HAVE A LOT OF
QUESTIONS, TOO.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.834
I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO CONNECT WITH HER,

26:14.877 --> 26:17.053
BUT SHE IS
NOT VERY TRUSTING

26:17.097 --> 26:19.534
AT THE MOMENT.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.841
SOUNDS LIKE
YOUR SISTER, ALL RIGHT.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.886
OK, WHAT'’S
OUR NEW PROBLEM?

26:23.930 --> 26:26.497
RIGHT. POLLARD
IS INSISTING YOU GO TO
THE TOWN HALL TONIGHT.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.848
WHAT? YOU EXPLAINED
TO HER--

26:28.891 --> 26:30.153
YEAH, OF COURSE I DID.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.720
BUT SHE ACTUALLY THINKS
THAT WE MADE UP CHIMERA

26:31.764 --> 26:33.940
AS AN EXCUSE TO GET YOU
TO NOT FACE THE CITY.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.856
IF I HAD A PROBLEM
BEING SCRUTINIZED,
DINAH,

26:36.899 --> 26:38.858
I WOULDN'’T LET
A CAMERA CREW
FOLLOW ME AROUND.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.642
I KNOW. I EXPLAINED
THAT TO HER.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.862
BUT IF YOU ASK ME,
SHE SEES THIS TOWN HALL

26:42.905 --> 26:44.515
AS A CHANCE TO
PUBLICLY CRUCIFY YOU,

26:44.559 --> 26:46.082
AND SHE'’S NOT
GONNA MISS THAT.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.562
I'’M NOT EXPOSING
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

26:47.606 --> 26:49.651
TO WHAT COULD
POTENTIALLY BECOME
A WAR ZONE.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.871
POLLARD CANNOT
FORCE ME TO.

26:51.914 --> 26:52.872
I WILL TELL HER.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.482
THANK YOU.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.136
MM-HMM. THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.660
HEY. YOU GOT A MINUTE?

26:58.704 --> 27:00.706
OF COURSE.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.882
I KNOW YOU DON'’T PLAN
ON DOING THIS TOWN HALL
MEETING THING, DO YOU?

27:02.925 --> 27:04.884
I JUST TOLD DINAH TO
TELL POLLARD THAT.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.407
I'’M THINKING MAYBE
YOU SHOULD.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.800
IT MIGHT BE OUR ONLY SHOT
AT CATCHING CHIMERA.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.323
CURTIS WILL
FIND HIM AGAIN.

27:09.366 --> 27:10.890
YEAH, WELL, THE TRAIL'’S
GONE COLD.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.893
BUT, OLIVER, I HAVE A PLAN.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.764
I'’M ALL EARS.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.331
SO ARE THEY.

27:17.374 --> 27:21.901
SORRY, GUYS.
PRIVATE PARTY.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.859
CAMERAMAN: UGH. DAMN IT.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.382
I ENJOYED THAT.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.471
YOU KNOW I KNOW WHAT
YOU'’RE GONNA SAY, RIGHT?

27:27.515 --> 27:28.690
I DO.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.910
BEST WAY TO STOP CHIMERA
IS BY DRAWING HIM OUT?

27:30.953 --> 27:32.694
EXACTLY.

27:32.738 --> 27:37.133
NOT WITH HUNDREDS OF
PEOPLE THERE, JOHN.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.309
THIS GUY'’S TAKEN
DOWN 4 VIGILANTES.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.790
HE IS OUT OF
THE SCPD'’S LEAGUE.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.357
YES, HE IS...

27:44.967 --> 27:46.708
BUT NOT TEAM ARROW'’S.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.275
WHAT? NO. NO.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.581
THERE'’S NO WORLD
IN WHICH POLLARD

27:50.625 --> 27:52.148
WILL ALLOW DINAH TO
DEPUTIZE ALL OF YOU.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.150
AND I'’M CERTAINLY
NOT GOING TO RISK YOU
GOING TO PRISON

27:54.194 --> 27:55.848
FOR VIOLATING
THE ANTI-VIGILANTE LAW.

27:55.891 --> 28:00.591
COME ON.
EVEN IF I WAS WILLING
TO TAKE THAT RISK,

28:00.635 --> 28:02.637
THERE IS
NO TEAM ARROW ANYMORE.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.943
BUT THERE IS.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.945
OLIVER, THERE IS.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.816
IT'’S JUST CHANGED.

28:09.949 --> 28:12.821
WE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
TEAM ARROW WHEN YOU
WERE IN SLABSIDE,

28:12.865 --> 28:15.606
BUT WE HAD
EACH OTHER'’S BACKS.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.913
JUST GIVE US A CHANCE,
MAN, TO HAVE YOURS.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.959
YOU COULD
GO TO PRISON.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.656
SO?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.614
YOU DID IT FOR US,

28:23.658 --> 28:25.834
WHICH NEVER REALLY
SAT RIGHT WITH ME.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.837
AND THE REASON WHY
IS BECAUSE IT
WASN'’T RIGHT, OLIVER.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.405
WE HAVE FIGHTS,
DISAGREEMENTS,
RECRIMINATIONS,

28:31.448 --> 28:34.713
BUT IT DOESN'’T MATTER
BECAUSE WE ARE A TEAM.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.412
AND NOTHING'’S GOING
TO CHANGE THAT.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.547
JOHN, I MADE A LOT
OF MISTAKES.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.898
WE ALL DID.

28:45.941 --> 28:50.424
THAT'’S WHY THEY'RE
CALLED MISTAKES, OLIVER.

28:50.467 --> 28:53.775
YOU LEARN FROM THEM.
YOU MOVE FORWARD.

28:53.819 --> 28:58.867
WE...WE GET BETTER.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.581
ANNOUNCER: LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

29:17.625 --> 29:20.802
WELCOME TO OUR TOWN HALL
DISCUSSION ON VIGILANTISM.

29:20.846 --> 29:24.675
