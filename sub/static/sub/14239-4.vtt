WEBVTT

00:02.719 --> 00:06.764
Torchwood. Outside the government,
beyond the police.

00:06.799 --> 00:11.520
Tracking down alien life on Earth and
arming the human race against the future.

00:11.555 --> 00:14.919
The 21st century is when
everything changes.

00:14.954 --> 00:16.645
And you've got to be ready.

00:16.680 --> 00:21.079
This programme
contains some strong language.

00:26.719 --> 00:28.920
SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER
OK!

00:28.955 --> 00:31.564
Come on, Gwen!

00:31.599 --> 00:33.439
LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING CONTINUES

00:36.679 --> 00:39.160
Gwen, this is for you, baby!
Come on!

00:43.360 --> 00:47.239
Just get it off him!
Take if out of his hands! Oi!

00:51.000 --> 00:53.444
Oh, come to Daddy!

00:53.479 --> 00:56.520
YES! First round's on you, boss.

00:56.555 --> 00:58.844
Girls, get your handbags!

00:58.879 --> 01:01.565
Of course, that was an illegal move.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.560
Totally illegal! Yeah, keep telling
yourself that, yeah. Losers. Bye.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.159 --> 01:22.565
He's never seen a live rugby match!

01:22.600 --> 01:24.524
I have other things
to do with my time!

01:24.559 --> 01:27.520
Rhys knows a bloke whose cousin
works at the Millennium Stadium.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.197
We should all go to the
next home international.

01:30.232 --> 01:32.839
Can you make it
two Pepperoni Feasts tonight?

01:32.874 --> 01:35.084
And a tub of coleslaw.

01:35.119 --> 01:37.879
My boss says I'm not
eating enough vegetables.

01:37.914 --> 01:42.799
Yeah, usual time. See you then.

01:48.919 --> 01:52.200
Good to see you again, sir. Are
they looking after you at the hotel?

01:54.319 --> 01:56.719
Konnichiwa, Tanizaki-san.
Konnichiwa.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.479
I did all I could.

02:32.514 --> 02:34.840
I really did.

03:30.199 --> 03:32.084
My God!

03:32.119 --> 03:36.039
It's not possible!
One of them survived!

03:43.560 --> 03:46.240
This is Lisa.

04:05.719 --> 04:09.240
Is she awake? It's just
a reaction to the medication.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.139
She's the only one left.

04:15.174 --> 04:17.639
Across the whole world.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.724
Thank you, thank you so much.

04:22.759 --> 04:26.839
Bringing me here. I never thought...

04:26.874 --> 04:28.320
to get my chance...

04:31.120 --> 04:34.199
.. to study...

04:34.234 --> 04:37.244
to work with...

04:37.279 --> 04:40.799
anything like this. Anyone!

04:40.834 --> 04:44.285
Tell me, what happened?

04:44.320 --> 04:47.479
She worked for Torchwood London.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.720
It was
the end of the Canary Wharf battle.

04:52.755 --> 04:54.845
The Cybermen needed soldiers fast.

04:54.880 --> 05:00.640
They started upgrading whole bodies instead
of transplanting brains using Earth technology.

05:00.675 --> 05:06.040
Lisa was halfway through the process when
the machinery shut down. You found her?

05:06.075 --> 05:07.600
Help!

05:09.799 --> 05:11.799
Help me, please!

05:11.834 --> 05:14.044
Somebody!

05:14.079 --> 05:17.199
I pulled her out.
Do you know the percentages?

05:17.234 --> 05:19.765
The what?

05:19.800 --> 05:22.124
Some elements have been augmented.

05:22.159 --> 05:26.579
Some are still human.
Sensory capacity, for instance.

05:26.614 --> 05:30.999
Her breathing and hearing
appears completely cybernetic.

05:31.034 --> 05:34.976
And yet... there's also bare flesh.

05:35.011 --> 05:38.884
Amazing. Perhaps 55% augmentation

05:38.919 --> 05:44.599
with 45% awaiting completion.
Do you think?

05:44.634 --> 05:48.879
Or perhaps, maybe 60/40.

05:48.914 --> 05:51.205
It's fascinating.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.845
Can you make her human again?

05:53.880 --> 06:00.600
You took parts from a Cyber conversion unit
and modified them into a life support for her?

06:00.635 --> 06:02.765
How did you know what to do?

06:02.800 --> 06:05.680
I told him.
I thought you were resting.

06:05.715 --> 06:07.564
You should be resting.

06:07.599 --> 06:10.200
How's the pain?
Are the new doses working?

06:10.235 --> 06:11.680
A little.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.899
Oh... Is this him?

06:16.934 --> 06:20.164
I promised, didn't I?

06:20.199 --> 06:23.365
And you always keep your promises.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.400
I would like to ask her
some questions.

06:28.600 --> 06:32.285
My name is Dr Tanizaki.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.645
I specialise in Cybernetics.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.119
Your friend, Mr Jones, asked me...

06:38.154 --> 06:39.605
My boyfriend.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.479
Yes. He asked me to come.

06:42.514 --> 06:45.817
We agreed, together.

06:45.852 --> 06:49.085
Few simple questions.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.079
What is your name? Lisa Hallett.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.484
How old are you? 26.

06:57.519 --> 07:02.080
What is the last thing you remember
before coming here?

07:04.239 --> 07:09.079
Somebody! Anybody!

07:09.114 --> 07:11.804
Pain.

07:11.839 --> 07:16.719
I remember my body burning with pain.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.365
You said...

07:21.400 --> 07:24.680
there was somewhere I
could work upstairs?

07:38.400 --> 07:42.079
This first stage should enable her
to breathe without the respirator.

07:46.959 --> 07:50.159
Once her body functions
without support,

07:50.194 --> 07:53.804
I can judge what work is needed.

07:53.839 --> 07:56.099
What if she's not ready
to breathe on her own?

07:56.134 --> 07:58.360
You must be prepared for her
not to survive.

08:03.679 --> 08:06.164
Sometimes...

08:06.199 --> 08:09.079
in order to save what we love,

08:09.114 --> 08:11.959
we have to risk losing it.

08:16.639 --> 08:21.480
MACHINES BEEP, HEART MONITOR
FLATLINES She's not strong enough!

08:21.515 --> 08:23.044
Let me do my work!

08:23.079 --> 08:26.765
And she said, "D'you know how difficult
it is to find a man in this city?

08:26.800 --> 08:29.839
"He had a nice flat, all his own hair, so
frankly, a couple of tusks, I can live with!"

08:29.874 --> 08:34.799
PAGER BEEPS
UFO sighting over Cardigan Bay.

08:34.833 --> 08:37.844
Seven calls to the
emergency services.

08:37.879 --> 08:40.080
Oh... Can we at least finish
our drinks, please? Sure.

08:40.115 --> 08:41.839
Take ten seconds.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.600
HEART MONITOR FLATLINES, LISA GASPS
If she dies because of you...

08:53.239 --> 08:55.999
SHE GASPS, HEART MONITOR BEEPS

08:59.040 --> 09:00.645
lanto?

09:00.680 --> 09:03.560
Yes, I'm here!

09:04.719 --> 09:07.360
She's breathing! It worked!

09:08.920 --> 09:10.999
Why aren't I connected?

09:11.034 --> 09:12.524
You're alive!

09:12.559 --> 09:15.284
He kept you alive!

09:15.319 --> 09:18.279
Thank you. This is only the start.

09:19.840 --> 09:24.799
COMPUTER BEEPS
We've gotta move.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.439
Quickly!

09:29.719 --> 09:31.525
I'll walk!

09:31.560 --> 09:35.759
You've only just woken up. You
can't. I want to walk! Please.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.400
Help her downstairs.
I'll clear up here.

09:45.639 --> 09:48.559
I'm alive.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.879
All I'm saying is, once in a while,
I'd like to drive!

09:55.914 --> 09:58.324
And all I'm saying is no! Why not?!

09:58.359 --> 10:01.844
Look, I've shared cars with women
before. I know what'll happen.

10:01.879 --> 10:05.924
There'll be an emergency, we're all
raring to go, I jump in, what do I find?

10:05.959 --> 10:09.920
Seat's in the wrong position, the rear view mirror's
out of line and the steering wheel's in my crotch.

10:09.955 --> 10:13.199
Time it takes to sort it all out,
aliens'll have taken Newport.

10:13.234 --> 10:14.640
JACK LAUGHS

10:22.639 --> 10:24.684
What about a rota?

10:24.719 --> 10:26.965
Different people drive on different
days.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.360
We're a secret organisation, hunting
alien technology from an underground base.

10:30.395 --> 10:32.400
And you want a rota for who drives?

10:32.435 --> 10:34.840
Just trying to help.

10:42.919 --> 10:45.079
As soon as they're gone,
I'll be down.

10:48.359 --> 10:53.605
Tosh, call up the radar within a 50-mile
radius of the Bay for the last six hours.

10:53.640 --> 11:00.559
Gwen, check with that man - Neil, I think his name
was, voice like Sean Connery - at Jodrell Bank.

11:00.594 --> 11:04.016
See if they picked up any chatter
around the time of the sightings.

11:04.051 --> 11:07.439
Owen, access the airspace provision
over Cardigan Bay, also any RAF

11:07.474 --> 11:10.000
flightplans, see if it's just
a case of mistaken identity.

11:19.039 --> 11:21.284
Take it slowly.

11:21.319 --> 11:23.320
You're still very weak.

11:29.239 --> 11:31.360
This way.

11:33.799 --> 11:35.959
HE CHOKES

11:42.759 --> 11:47.165
Is that Neil?
It's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.079
I know, we're always after
something, aren't we? lanto!

11:54.040 --> 11:55.719
Would you work some coffee magic?

12:13.479 --> 12:15.044
Lisa!

12:15.079 --> 12:17.084
Let me go!

12:17.119 --> 12:18.644
I can help you.

12:18.679 --> 12:22.680
The human race is weak.
I can make you strong.

12:44.360 --> 12:48.524
What's happening?
Internal power drain.

12:48.559 --> 12:53.080
What's causing it? Something big
to drain that amount of power.

12:53.115 --> 12:55.159
Tosh, run a system diagnostic.

12:55.194 --> 12:57.044
Actually...

12:57.079 --> 13:00.159
We've been having generator problems all
evening. I was down there checking earlier.

13:00.194 --> 13:03.439
Couple of bits of cabling
have come loose.

13:03.474 --> 13:05.799
I thought I'd fixed it.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.720
Let me have another look.

13:10.755 --> 13:13.045
Fine. Go check.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.320
Want some help? It's fine.

13:16.355 --> 13:17.799
ALARM BLARES

13:20.919 --> 13:22.399
You've got to shut down the power!

13:28.519 --> 13:31.484
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

13:31.519 --> 13:34.240
What happened?! His upgrade failed.

13:34.275 --> 13:36.319
Was it an accident?

13:38.119 --> 13:39.884
Tell me you didn't do this!

13:39.919 --> 13:42.325
I wanted to repay
him for helping me.

13:42.360 --> 13:45.159
By removing the
weaknesses of his humanity.

13:45.194 --> 13:46.885
What have you done?!

13:46.920 --> 13:48.685
You've killed an innocent man!

13:48.720 --> 13:51.960
It's all right. It's not all right! They're
gonna come looking for me in a minute.

13:51.995 --> 13:54.559
If they see the body, if they
find out what we've been doing...

13:54.594 --> 13:57.679
I can deal with them.
Don't you go near them!

14:01.120 --> 14:03.485
You didn't mean to do this.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.959
Something's happened to your mind.

14:05.994 --> 14:07.724
Um... just, um...

14:07.759 --> 14:09.880
Some kind of side effect
from this whole process.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.757
It's post-traumatic.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.565
You didn't mean to...

14:13.600 --> 14:15.679
You've ruined everything now!

14:20.879 --> 14:24.400
How hard have we had to work
to keep you alive?

14:26.200 --> 14:27.679
And now you do this.

14:34.399 --> 14:37.160
I need you to stay in here.

14:37.195 --> 14:39.685
Rest.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.839
Don't come out unless I tell you.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.779
This can't happen again, Lisa.

14:47.814 --> 14:50.639
If you harm anyone else, I'll...

14:50.674 --> 14:52.405
Yes?

14:52.440 --> 14:54.040
What will you do?

14:59.279 --> 15:01.759
OK, the body.

15:03.319 --> 15:07.600
I've got to deal with the body.
I can do this.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.445
This is my fault!

15:15.480 --> 15:17.440
I'm responsible for this!

15:32.719 --> 15:34.200
I'll hide the body.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.879
Everything's gonna be OK.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.124
That's a UFO?!

16:05.159 --> 16:09.445
Only just! Arkan leisure
crawler, first generation.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.839
Collectors' item, don't see
many of those around these days.

16:11.874 --> 16:15.045
Tosh,
send a polite message saying great

16:15.080 --> 16:17.519
to see them, but could they please
get the hell out of our atmosphere

16:17.554 --> 16:20.004
they're spooking the locals. Done!

16:20.039 --> 16:21.839
Shouldn't we be apprehending it?
Investigating it? Oh, please.

16:21.874 --> 16:24.957
You interrogate an Arkan,
you'll be in there for a month.

16:24.992 --> 16:27.716
And that's just the first question.
They are so boring.

16:27.751 --> 16:30.440
Besides, they're mostly liquid,
the cells would be a mess.

16:32.239 --> 16:35.365
There it goes again!

16:35.400 --> 16:39.160
lanto, we've got another dose of
darkness. You found anything?

16:39.195 --> 16:41.080
ALARM BLARES

16:45.319 --> 16:49.039
lanto? I need to hear those
beautiful Welsh vowels!

17:02.040 --> 17:05.079
Power's draining to the storeroom
at the bottom of the building.

17:05.114 --> 17:07.000
Looking for human heat signals.

17:09.079 --> 17:12.160
We've got... Two signals?
So assuming one's lanto...

17:12.194 --> 17:14.084
Who's the other?

17:14.118 --> 17:16.565
I'm thinking we're under attack.

17:16.599 --> 17:19.839
Security's been breached.
We assume battle protocols.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.364
That's impossible!

17:21.398 --> 17:22.964
Nobody can get in without triggering

17:22.999 --> 17:28.398
seven separate alarms. Yeah, well, looks
like our system needs to be upgraded.

17:28.434 --> 17:31.404
I'll head down and look for lanto.

17:31.439 --> 17:33.319
I'll come with you.
You all right with that?

17:33.354 --> 17:35.564
Keep your comms open at all times.

17:35.599 --> 17:38.400
Any doubts, shoot first.
Priority is to find lanto.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.799
I'm sorry.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.539
What's down here?

18:17.574 --> 18:20.044
Normally? Nothing.

18:20.079 --> 18:22.324
'Progress report?' Signs of...

18:22.359 --> 18:26.680
'activity at the eastern end of the main
corridor. ' We're losing your comms signals.

18:26.715 --> 18:28.399
We're going in to have a look.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.799
Whatever that power source is,
it's interfering with the comms.

18:34.834 --> 18:37.217
Gwen, Owen? Can you hear me?

18:37.252 --> 18:39.565
Damn! Can we get them back?

18:39.600 --> 18:43.004
Trying other channels. There's
something else you need to see.

18:43.039 --> 18:47.239
I've gone back through our internal CCTV
footage for the last couple of hours.

18:47.274 --> 18:50.479
Someone's tried to remove
the images from our system.

18:50.514 --> 18:52.484
See, now I'm starting
to get a little peeved.

18:52.519 --> 18:55.200
These people come into my
house, start using my things...

18:55.235 --> 18:56.680
I've dug into the system memory.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.240
What the hell's going on here?!

19:03.275 --> 19:05.757
Jack?

19:05.792 --> 19:08.204
Tosh?

19:08.239 --> 19:09.880
Gwen? Owen? Can you hear me?

19:09.915 --> 19:12.164
No comms.

19:12.199 --> 19:13.959
We're on our own, then.

19:20.679 --> 19:22.959
What the hell is going on?

19:25.399 --> 19:29.799
What's the matter? I can't see well
enough. But there's something in there.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.199
Some kind of operating table.

19:34.159 --> 19:36.360
Get the bolts.

19:41.839 --> 19:43.320
OK? Yeah.

19:45.039 --> 19:48.399
OK, one, two...

19:58.799 --> 20:00.739
No! No, no, no, no!

20:00.774 --> 20:02.679
What the hell is it?!

20:02.714 --> 20:04.925
It's wrong.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.759
It's beyond wrong!
It shouldn't be here!

20:07.794 --> 20:10.320
Turn the thing off! TURN IT OFF!

20:16.440 --> 20:20.599
Internal levels are being restored!
Gwen? Owen? Can you hear me?

20:20.634 --> 20:22.604
COMMS CRACKLE

20:22.639 --> 20:26.880
These things brought down
Torchwood One.

20:26.915 --> 20:29.605
But they were all destroyed.

20:29.640 --> 20:33.999
Why is there one in our bloody
basement?! Just tell me what it does!

20:34.034 --> 20:36.916
It's the remnants
of a conversion unit.

20:36.951 --> 20:39.764
This machinery
turns humans into Cybermen.

20:39.799 --> 20:44.760
If I don't hear something within 30 seconds,
I'm coming down there! Jack, it's Gwen.

20:44.795 --> 20:47.160
The comms dropped out.
We're back online now.

20:47.195 --> 20:49.924
'Any sign of lanto?' No.

20:49.959 --> 20:52.604
But we have found parts
of a Cyber conversion unit.

20:52.639 --> 20:56.599
'Fully powered up and working. ' This
is no time to be kidding around, Owen.

20:56.634 --> 20:59.605
I'm deadly serious!

20:59.640 --> 21:03.040
I dunno why it's here,
or how it got here.

21:03.075 --> 21:05.439
But that's what's draining
our power.

21:10.399 --> 21:13.600
Jack? You there? I want you
two back up here immediately!

21:15.159 --> 21:17.804
We still haven't found...

21:17.839 --> 21:22.844
Jack, code zero incursion. Repeat!

21:22.879 --> 21:25.565
'Code zero incursion.
We're under attack. '

21:25.600 --> 21:28.000
If you don't hear from me within
15 minutes, activate total shutdown

21:28.035 --> 21:29.877
procedures and get
yourself to safety.

21:29.912 --> 21:31.684
But I can't just leave you all here!

21:31.719 --> 21:35.200
If there's a Cyberman in this building,
we need a last line of defence.

21:35.235 --> 21:37.999
Just make sure it never
gets to the outside world.

21:45.999 --> 21:51.960
Whatever you... Whoever you are...
I don't mean you any harm.

21:51.995 --> 21:54.120
But come any closer, I'll shoot.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.519
SHE CHOKES

22:02.719 --> 22:05.084
Let me go!

22:05.119 --> 22:06.739
Do not struggle.

22:06.774 --> 22:08.359
You will be like me.

22:18.639 --> 22:20.684
GWEN CRIES IN PAIN

22:20.719 --> 22:25.440
Throw down any weapons, put your
hands up and turn and face me!

22:25.475 --> 22:27.644
GWEN SCREAMS

22:27.679 --> 22:30.240
You're a woman! Owen! JACK!

22:33.199 --> 22:34.924
GWEN SCREAMS

22:34.959 --> 22:39.520
She doesn't know what she's doing!
You are fighting the wrong guy!

22:42.519 --> 22:45.919
Get me out of here, someone, please!

22:50.359 --> 22:53.359
Switch it off!
I'm trying!

22:53.394 --> 22:56.324
She's changed all the circuits!

22:56.359 --> 22:59.679
Shut off the power everywhere!
Toshiko, cut all power in the base!

22:59.714 --> 23:02.719
I do that, the base goes into
lockdown! We'll be trapped.

23:02.754 --> 23:04.639
Just do it!

23:06.479 --> 23:08.199
Switch it off!

23:25.800 --> 23:28.364
Gwen? I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine.

23:28.399 --> 23:32.524
Sort of.
Jack, please get me out of here!

23:32.559 --> 23:34.759
It's all right.
Where is she? Where did she go?

23:34.794 --> 23:36.516
Please tell me you got her!

23:36.551 --> 23:38.239
Stand guard by the door.

23:42.319 --> 23:43.920
I'm sorry.

23:45.519 --> 23:47.520
I'm really sorry. What for?

23:52.719 --> 23:54.720
Let's just get out of here.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.960
Clear? Clear.

24:18.399 --> 24:21.324
Oh, God, there she is. What is she?

24:21.359 --> 24:25.444
Some form of Cyberman.
They're us, upgraded.

24:25.479 --> 24:28.920
Humans with emotions removed, created on a
parallel world and supposedly destroyed on this one.

24:28.955 --> 24:32.199
What are we gonna do? I don't know.

24:36.679 --> 24:38.204
She's gone.

24:38.239 --> 24:42.644
GUN CLICKS
Get us back to the Hub.

24:42.679 --> 24:46.444
Jack, what are you doing?!
Resisting the urge to shoot.

24:46.479 --> 24:50.204
Tosh, get everything from the
weapons room. Fast as you can.

24:50.239 --> 24:54.164
It's locked down, there's no manual
override. Just open the store!

24:54.199 --> 25:01.479
On your knees! Hands above your head! Jack, for
God's sake! What are you doing?! I gave you an order!

25:01.514 --> 25:03.685
Gwen, help her!

25:03.720 --> 25:09.120
Did you know that thing
was down there? I put her there.

25:09.155 --> 25:12.684
You hid a Cyberman
within Torchwood?!

25:12.719 --> 25:17.880
And you didn't tell us?
What else are you keeping from us?

25:17.915 --> 25:21.004
Like you care. I clear up your shit.

25:21.039 --> 25:24.999
No questions asked
and that's the way you like it.

25:25.034 --> 25:28.960
When did you last
ask me anything about my life?

25:32.879 --> 25:35.204
Her name's Lisa.

25:35.239 --> 25:39.000
She's my girlfriend. Why didn't you
tell us? We could have helped you.

25:39.035 --> 25:43.279
Torchwood exists to destroy
alien threats.

25:43.314 --> 25:45.484
Why would I tell you about her?

25:45.519 --> 25:47.959
A little loyalty, perhaps?
My loyalty's to her!

25:49.600 --> 25:52.524
She worked for Torchwood.

25:52.559 --> 25:56.920
She was caught up in battle.
I owe it to Lisa...

25:56.955 --> 25:58.877
WE owe it to her...

25:58.912 --> 26:00.764
to find a cure.

26:00.799 --> 26:02.924
lanto, you have to believe me.
There is no cure.

26:02.959 --> 26:07.560
There never will be. Those who
are converted stay that way.

26:07.595 --> 26:10.200
Your girlfriend will
not be the exception.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.085
You can't know that for sure.

26:12.120 --> 26:15.564
Look, you need to know
what's happening here.

26:15.599 --> 26:22.800
Because this is where these things start.
Small decisions that become mass slaughter.

26:22.835 --> 26:28.079
These creatures regain a foothold
by exploiting human weakness.

26:28.114 --> 26:29.764
Then they take a base.

26:29.799 --> 26:34.639
Rebuild their forces. And before you know it, the
Cyber race is spreading out across the universe,

26:34.674 --> 26:37.236
erasing worlds,
assimilating populations.

26:37.271 --> 26:39.799
All because of the
tiny beginnings here.

26:41.959 --> 26:44.640
We need to stop her... together!

26:48.559 --> 26:53.359
You're not listening to me!
The conversion was never completed!

26:53.394 --> 26:55.036
She already tried to kill Gwen!

26:55.071 --> 26:56.644
You think she's gonna stop there?

26:56.679 --> 27:01.920
There is no turning back for
her now! I'm... not giving up on her.

27:04.159 --> 27:05.640
I love her.

27:08.679 --> 27:10.560
Can you understand that, Jack?

27:12.640 --> 27:14.959
Haven't you ever loved anyone?

27:17.280 --> 27:20.400
You need to figure out
whose side you're on here.

27:20.435 --> 27:23.485
Because if you don't know...

27:23.520 --> 27:27.139
you're not going to make it
out of this alive.

27:27.174 --> 27:30.724
There's no way this weapons
store's gonna open.

27:30.759 --> 27:33.039
It's going to take six hours for
the power to come back online.

27:33.074 --> 27:35.845
Let me talk to her.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.439
I can still save her.
Save all of us.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.280
She's not a monster.

27:42.315 --> 27:44.440
MECHANICAL WHIRRING

27:46.279 --> 27:48.205
lanto!

27:48.240 --> 27:52.639
Lisa... It's me.

27:53.799 --> 27:56.879
You can't just let him go... Ssh!

27:56.914 --> 27:59.959
The army will be rebuilt
from here.

27:59.994 --> 28:03.164
This building is suitable.

28:03.199 --> 28:06.240
Who are you? Human point two.

28:06.275 --> 28:09.445
No! Lisa...

28:09.480 --> 28:13.039
So how come you look
like human point one?

28:13.074 --> 28:15.404
I do not understand.

28:15.439 --> 28:19.724
Look at yourself. Go ahead.

28:19.759 --> 28:25.080
Remember, Lisa.
Remember who you are.

28:25.115 --> 28:28.120
The upgrade is incomplete.

28:28.155 --> 28:30.279
You're still human.

28:30.314 --> 28:32.497
I am...

28:32.532 --> 28:34.385
disgusting.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.239
I have...

28:37.959 --> 28:41.564
I am...

28:41.599 --> 28:44.259
wrong. We can help you.

28:44.294 --> 28:46.885
I must start again.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.279
Upgrade properly. For God's sake!

28:49.314 --> 28:50.719
Have you heard yourself?

28:52.600 --> 28:58.759
Lisa, please.
I brought you here to heal you.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.599
So we could be together.

29:04.759 --> 29:10.879
Together. Yes. Transplant
my brain into your body.

29:10.914 --> 29:13.879
The two of us... together.

29:13.914 --> 29:15.644
Fused.

29:15.679 --> 29:18.439
We'll be one complete person.

29:18.474 --> 29:21.519
Isn't that what love is?

29:21.554 --> 29:25.364
No.

29:25.399 --> 29:28.399
Then we are not compatible.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.724
Argh!

29:37.759 --> 29:39.879
Code Nine manoeuvres. Go!

29:42.240 --> 29:44.780
Gwen! Gwen! Get out of there!

29:44.815 --> 29:47.320
Lisa! What you waiting for?

30:02.319 --> 30:05.280
Run. We all ran.

30:09.400 --> 30:14.560
She's coming after us. There's a surprise Could
you be any less helpful?! I just helped you escape!

30:14.595 --> 30:16.604
Shut up, both of you!

30:16.639 --> 30:19.244
OK, now,
this is a fight to the death.

30:19.279 --> 30:22.960
We do whatever is necessary
to destroy her.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.405
Forget what lanto said.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.199
That thing is not human. Clear?
Yeah, yeah.

30:29.040 --> 30:34.920
What's this? Something Suzie scavenged. She
claimed that it could open any lock in 45 seconds.

30:34.955 --> 30:38.520
I want you out the exit gates up
the emergency stairs to reception.

30:38.555 --> 30:41.080
She'll never open that door
without power! It weighs a ton!

30:41.115 --> 30:42.857
Anyway, I'm not leaving you here!

30:42.892 --> 30:44.599
Just do as I say! All of you!

30:47.319 --> 30:49.525
Once in reception...

30:49.560 --> 30:52.765
panel next to the desk,
pull it out.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.800
Take circuit 357 from the main
system and patch it to these.

30:55.835 --> 30:58.844
There should be enough power
in there for what we need.

30:58.879 --> 31:02.959
Once the main circuit goes live,
get out. Meet us by the water tower.

31:02.994 --> 31:09.284
Go!.. You two... find anything
that even resembles a weapon.

31:09.319 --> 31:14.599
Autopsy room. There should be some lethal equipment...
What are you gonna do? Buy you some time. Go!

31:14.634 --> 31:18.085
Hey! Lisa!

31:18.120 --> 31:22.440
It is Lisa, isn't it?
You've been hiding in my basement.

31:22.475 --> 31:24.364
That's OK.

31:24.399 --> 31:27.844
Draining my power,
I can live with that...

31:27.879 --> 31:31.119
But now you're starting to hurt my
friends. This is gonna stop!

31:41.400 --> 31:46.765
Come on!
This building belongs to me now.

31:46.800 --> 31:51.640
You will all be deleted... I'm sorry for
what they did to you. But this ends here.

32:12.039 --> 32:16.159
How did he survive that?
Is that all you got?

32:16.194 --> 32:18.079
I'm not so easily deleted.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.199
We can't help him.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.199
Shit!

33:36.360 --> 33:39.279
Is there another exit? No!
We're trapped?!

33:39.314 --> 33:40.924
Get in!

33:40.959 --> 33:45.159
No way! Lie on top of me and it'll take
us both. I'm not laying on top of you!

33:45.194 --> 33:47.760
I'm not saying it's a brilliant idea,
but it's the only one we've got!

34:35.639 --> 34:37.440
What do we do?

35:01.320 --> 35:03.719
IANTO PANTS

35:05.160 --> 35:06.959
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

35:09.199 --> 35:13.519
Where is it?
Quick, please! Turn it off!

35:20.520 --> 35:23.204
Turn it off!

35:23.239 --> 35:26.684
All right, lover,
it's the man of your dreams!

35:26.719 --> 35:32.479
I've had a couple of beers with Daf and we're
off for a curry, so can you video Wife Swap?

35:37.440 --> 35:39.199
Don't you touch her!

35:39.234 --> 35:43.159
LISA SCREAMS

35:51.160 --> 35:53.440
What the hell was that?

35:53.475 --> 35:56.765
What? Snogging me!

35:56.800 --> 35:59.125
Last kiss for the condemned man!

35:59.160 --> 36:01.604
Little embarrassing given
we haven't been killed.

36:01.639 --> 36:04.800
What?! It's not like I fancy you or
anything. I was on top of you.

36:04.835 --> 36:06.365
I could feel your hard-on.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.600
Yeah, well,
you didn't exactly struggle, did you?

36:12.840 --> 36:15.164
It was kill or be killed.

36:15.199 --> 36:18.199
Owen's right. There was no choice.

36:22.399 --> 36:24.484
lanto, move! Get out!

36:24.519 --> 36:27.279
GET OUT I SAID! MOVE! MOVE!

36:32.599 --> 36:34.539
You should be dead.

36:34.574 --> 36:36.480
I'm the stubborn type.

36:36.515 --> 36:39.679
Get behind me!

36:43.360 --> 36:46.360
357, 357, come on!

36:48.719 --> 36:52.364
That's right. Stay back.

36:52.399 --> 36:55.000
This'll at least give you heartburn.

36:55.035 --> 36:56.924
The power will run out.

36:56.959 --> 36:58.685
I can wait. Jack, help her.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.399
Give her a chance to surrender...

37:00.434 --> 37:02.044
Have you not seen what she's done?

37:02.079 --> 37:04.999
Let her stay in the cells!
We have to reverse the process!

37:05.034 --> 37:07.685
I've told you! We're past that!

37:07.720 --> 37:11.320
Hold him back! What are you gonna do? Don't ask
questions, just get him on there and hold him!

37:15.240 --> 37:19.480
What is that stuff? Kind of a barbecue
sauce. It helps identify its food.

37:19.515 --> 37:22.479
Help what identify its food?!

37:22.514 --> 37:24.524
I'm sorry.

37:24.559 --> 37:27.039
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS

37:27.074 --> 37:29.520
You'll kill her!

37:32.839 --> 37:35.079
Let me go! Let me help her!

37:38.839 --> 37:41.125
Yes!

37:41.160 --> 37:43.040
Hold him still!

37:43.075 --> 37:44.719
NO!

37:54.360 --> 37:56.599
Call it off her! You can do that!

37:59.880 --> 38:01.800
Have some fucking mercy!

38:14.719 --> 38:17.080
NO-O-O!

38:37.680 --> 38:39.480
It worked!

38:40.719 --> 38:42.639
What happened to...? No.

38:46.839 --> 38:50.204
You could have saved her! Argh!

38:50.239 --> 38:53.399
You're worse than anything
locked up down there!

38:53.434 --> 38:56.559
One day,
I'll have the chance to save you...

38:56.594 --> 38:58.805
and I'll watch you suffer and die.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.119
It was the only thing
that would stop her!

39:03.319 --> 39:07.099
Listen, when I was at reception, I
managed to trip the lockdown timer.

39:07.134 --> 39:10.879
The power should be coming back
on any second. We can get back in.

39:10.914 --> 39:13.680
lanto!

39:18.840 --> 39:20.644
Pizza!

39:20.679 --> 39:22.799
DOOR BUZZES

39:32.040 --> 39:34.039
lanto?

39:48.480 --> 39:50.804
Bloody hell!

39:50.839 --> 39:54.639
lanto? D'you want these or not?

39:54.674 --> 39:56.839
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS

40:03.199 --> 40:06.484
lanto! Stop!
She can't have survived that attack.

40:06.519 --> 40:11.699
I used my initiative! I'm sorry! When I want
you to think for yourself, I'll tell you.

40:11.734 --> 40:16.879
Maybe if you'd told me your plan, I wouldn't
have done it! lanto, don't be stupid!

40:16.914 --> 40:20.479
I've nothing left to lose. There's
always something left to lose.

40:20.514 --> 40:22.084
I'm going back in to save her.

40:22.119 --> 40:27.000
Anybody tries to stop me, I'll
shoot them. lanto, put the gun...

40:30.679 --> 40:35.079
You make a threat like that, you
better be prepared to follow it through.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.244
See, you disobey me now...

40:39.279 --> 40:45.679
I really will shoot you. Get off me!
You wanna go back in there?

40:45.714 --> 40:48.480
You go in to finish the job.

40:48.515 --> 40:50.639
If she's still alive,

40:50.674 --> 40:52.159
you execute her.

40:55.719 --> 40:59.899
No way. You brought this down on us.

40:59.934 --> 41:04.044
You hid her.
You hid yourself from us.

41:04.079 --> 41:07.119
Now it's time for you
to stand as part of the team.

41:07.154 --> 41:12.360
Jack... The girl you loved has gone.

41:12.395 --> 41:15.217
Your loyalty is to us now.

41:15.252 --> 41:18.005
You can't order me to do that.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.199
You execute her or
I'll execute you both!

41:20.234 --> 41:23.356
I won't do it. You can't make me.

41:23.391 --> 41:26.444
You like to think you're a hero.

41:26.479 --> 41:29.479
But you're the
biggest monster of all.

41:35.599 --> 41:39.000
I'm giving you ten minutes.

41:39.035 --> 41:42.240
Then we're coming in.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.200
Pick it up.

41:56.560 --> 41:59.439
How can you ask him...?
I don't need your opinion!

42:16.120 --> 42:20.080
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS

42:33.999 --> 42:34.999
Lisa!

43:04.079 --> 43:05.199
lanto...

43:07.719 --> 43:11.680
lanto, it's me. It's Lisa.

43:17.239 --> 43:21.725
I'm human again.

43:21.760 --> 43:27.399
You fought so hard for me, I had to hold on for
you, so I took this body and transplanted the brain.

43:30.600 --> 43:34.759
You're not Lisa. You always said you
didn't love me for what I looked like.

43:34.794 --> 43:39.480
Last time you said that,
it was a Saturday.

43:39.515 --> 43:42.845
We were hungover.

43:42.880 --> 43:47.040
You made cheese toasties, and
moaned I hadn't descaled my kettle.

43:49.279 --> 43:51.759
That night, we camped
on a beach in Brittany.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.959
It got so freezing we wore our
coats and shared one sleeping bag.

43:59.239 --> 44:02.599
When we woke up the next morning,
a dog was pissing on our tent.

44:05.599 --> 44:07.080
Hold me, lanto.

44:09.679 --> 44:11.564
I need you to hold me.

44:11.599 --> 44:15.559
I need you to tell me
it's all right.

44:18.959 --> 44:21.000
HE CRIES

44:35.160 --> 44:37.765
GUN CLICKS

44:37.800 --> 44:40.200
What are you doing?

44:40.235 --> 44:42.600
lanto, it's me!

44:45.880 --> 44:47.359
You wouldn't shoot me.

44:50.959 --> 44:52.839
I did this for you!

44:54.840 --> 44:58.879
I'm sorry.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.839
Lisa!

45:16.399 --> 45:18.920
We can be upgraded together.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.519
ALARM BLARES

46:40.960 --> 46:43.084
You'd never have shot him.
Not really.

46:43.119 --> 46:48.120
Wouldn't I? Would you have shot
me if I'd gone to stand by him?

46:48.155 --> 46:50.479
But you didn't.
If I had, though. But you didn't.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.600
Will he stay?

46:57.839 --> 46:59.765
All that deception.

46:59.800 --> 47:02.839
Because he couldn't
bear to live without her.

47:08.239 --> 47:10.840
So have you ever loved anyone
that much?

47:15.759 --> 47:20.920
When she had hold of you, I thought, just for a
moment, I thought maybe you could die after all.

47:22.920 --> 47:25.720
Wanna know a secret?

47:25.755 --> 47:27.199
So did I.

47:30.959 --> 47:35.040
And just for a second there,
I felt so... alive.

48:10.159 --> 48:13.045
Are you kidding me?

48:13.080 --> 48:16.300
That's him, we have to find him
before all hell let's loose.

48:16.335 --> 48:19.520
It's little girls, their little
bodies. No-one can hurt me.

48:19.555 --> 48:21.805
They protect their own,
their chosen ones.

48:21.840 --> 48:23.760
Are you saying our
machines can't pick them up?

48:23.795 --> 48:25.684
Nothing can.

48:25.719 --> 48:28.399
She was beautiful,
I loved her at first sight.

48:28.434 --> 48:30.085
It's gone crazy.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.245
No!
This means these creatures

48:32.280 --> 48:35.599
can invade my life whenever they
feel like it and I am scared, Jack.

48:35.634 --> 48:37.920
For the sake of the world,
this is our only chance!
