00:03.090 --> 00:04.352
Previously onMom:I'm getting a lot
of complaints.

00:04.439 --> 00:05.005
[crying]:
Really? About what?

00:07.485 --> 00:09.009
Well, apparently,
one of my waitresses

00:09.096 --> 00:12.229
is having a
nervous breakdown.

00:12.316 --> 00:14.840
Is it Jennifer?

00:14.927 --> 00:16.451
You're making this about me?

00:16.538 --> 00:18.148
No, it's okay.
I have come to understand

00:18.235 --> 00:19.628
that you were the best daughter
you could be.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.065
My job is to forgive you,
which I do.

00:22.152 --> 00:25.416
Oh, my God!

00:25.503 --> 00:27.549
I've watched you
lick cocaine crumbs

00:27.636 --> 00:29.725
out of a shag carpet.

00:31.770 --> 00:35.470
It's not a sin
to be thrifty, dear.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.515
I got pregnant with you
when I was a teenager,

00:37.602 --> 00:39.082
and please
don't take this

00:39.169 --> 00:42.738
the wrong way--
it ruined my life.

00:42.825 --> 00:45.610
Sleeping with your
boss-- who does that?

00:45.697 --> 00:47.090
[chuckles]

00:47.177 --> 00:48.048
ROSCOE:
Mom?

00:51.138 --> 00:56.012
Christy, you know
my, uh, wife?

00:56.099 --> 00:57.100
Yeah. Hi, Claudia.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.276
Nice to see you again.

00:59.363 --> 01:00.103
It's "Clowdia."

01:02.540 --> 01:04.238
FYI, the ladies' room
needs some attention.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.935
I don't know if
that's you, Christy.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.068
It's not,

01:08.155 --> 01:10.374
and it's "Christ-y."

01:10.461 --> 01:12.072
Oh, I almost forgot,

01:12.159 --> 01:13.073
your daughter thinks
she might be pregnant.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.248
Call me if you need me.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.945
[door closes]

01:16.032 --> 01:20.297
"Remove the test stick
from the foil wrapper

01:20.384 --> 01:22.473
"and take off the over-cap.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.780
"Holding the test
by the thumb grip,

01:24.867 --> 01:26.999
place the absorbent tip
in urine stream."

01:28.044 --> 01:30.960
You got to tinkle on it.

01:31.047 --> 01:35.356
It's not the first time
I've done a pregnancy test, Mom.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.227
Really?

01:37.314 --> 01:40.100
Then why'd you make me read
all those instructions?

01:41.144 --> 01:42.493
Not important.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.539
Let it rip.

01:45.975 --> 01:46.976
Can I have some privacy, please?

01:47.063 --> 01:49.587
Sure.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.633
[clears throat]

01:55.854 --> 01:58.509
Violet, I just
want you to know

01:58.596 --> 02:00.511
that if it turns out
you are pregnant,

02:00.598 --> 02:03.558
I will support you
no matter what you decide to do.

02:03.645 --> 02:04.820
Thank you.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.130
What do you think
you're gonna do?

02:10.217 --> 02:11.131
What?

02:11.218 --> 02:12.349
You know,

02:12.436 --> 02:13.481
which way you leaning?

02:13.568 --> 02:15.047
I don't know. Get out.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.397
Okay, sorry.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.010
You know, when I found out
I was pregnant with you,

02:21.097 --> 02:24.492
a home pregnancy test
took about 20 minutes.

02:24.579 --> 02:25.493
Uh-huh.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.625
Now it's two minutes.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.932
That's progress.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.499
Yay, science.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.762
I guess.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.155
I mean, it's good news for you,

02:35.242 --> 02:36.591
because the nervous waiting time
is less.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.897
Mom, I can't do this
if you're talking to me.

02:38.984 --> 02:40.334
All right, sure.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.900
Pee-shy runs in the family.

02:41.987 --> 02:42.988
Mom!

02:43.075 --> 02:44.076
Sorry.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.426
[trickling]

02:45.513 --> 02:46.557
Oh, good girl!

02:46.644 --> 02:47.341
Be quiet!

02:47.428 --> 02:48.994
[knocking]

02:49.081 --> 02:51.736
Hello?

02:51.823 --> 02:52.911
Hi.

02:52.998 --> 02:53.912
What's the word?

02:53.999 --> 02:56.263
She's doing the test now.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.002
We'll know in a couple minutes.

02:57.089 --> 03:00.223
Wow. Gulp.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.269
Yeah.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.661
When I was pregnant with you,

03:03.748 --> 03:05.489
those home kits took,
like, two hours.

03:05.576 --> 03:09.754
Really?It was a long wait
in a gas station bathroom.

03:09.841 --> 03:10.625
Bonnie, is that you?Yeah, honey.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.322
Can you come in?

03:12.409 --> 03:15.195
Of course.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.415
Why does your grandmother
get to go in and I don't?

03:18.502 --> 03:20.243
Because she won't
lecture me.

03:20.330 --> 03:23.115
I-I don't lecture.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.117
I share my experiences

03:25.205 --> 03:27.859
in the hope that you'll have
a better life than I had,

03:27.946 --> 03:29.078
and frankly, I think you
could be a little more grateful.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.166
Oh, screw it, I'm coming in.

03:30.253 --> 03:33.038
What's it say?
What's it say?

03:33.125 --> 03:34.649
Nothing yet.

03:34.736 --> 03:35.998
Oh, God, oh, God.

03:36.085 --> 03:36.912
I know, it's so exciting.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.001
I'm glad you're excited.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.263
I'm scared to death.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.047
Hey, don't you worry.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.789
I'm gonna be here for you
whenever you need me, 24-7.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.835
Thanks, Bonnie.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.447
I'm gonna be here
for you, too.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.536
That's your job, Mom.

03:52.623 --> 03:53.624
Ooh.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.235
Here we go,
showtime.

03:59.151 --> 04:02.242
Okay.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.418
Wow.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.028
You doing all right?

04:06.115 --> 04:08.813
I... don't know.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.425
Excuse me.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.605
I can't believe this.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.519
Hey, you have to take
some of the responsibility

04:19.607 --> 04:21.130
for this pregnancy.

04:21.216 --> 04:22.523
Are you kidding?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.264
We had the talk.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.614
I told her about abstinence,
condoms, everything.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.833
Did you mention oral sex
as a work-around?

04:30.879 --> 04:32.315
Oh, my God, it is my fault.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.467
[sighs]

04:55.251 --> 04:58.515
When are you gonna stop
with the bangs?

04:59.560 --> 05:00.474
What?

05:00.561 --> 05:03.172
I just... I understood it

05:03.259 --> 05:04.956
when you had a forehead
full of pimples,

05:05.043 --> 05:07.132
but now you're just hiding
a pretty face.

05:07.219 --> 05:09.134
This is the look now.

05:09.221 --> 05:11.136
The First Lady
wears her hair like this.

05:11.223 --> 05:14.096
Well, I don't think
it works on her, either.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.925
Noted.

05:17.012 --> 05:20.015
[sighs]

05:20.102 --> 05:21.277
What are we gonna do
about Violet?

05:21.364 --> 05:22.452
I love her hair.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.673
No, the pregnancy.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.805
I don't want her
to wind up like us.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.111
What's the matter with us?

05:30.895 --> 05:33.507
The fact that you don't know
speaks volumes.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.685
She has options.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.382
I know.

05:39.469 --> 05:42.167
[sighs]
Did I ever tell you

05:42.254 --> 05:44.344
how close I came
to giving you up for adoption?

05:45.867 --> 05:47.390
What?

05:47.477 --> 05:49.218
Lovely Jewish couple
from San Francisco,

05:49.305 --> 05:52.134
the Lowensteins.

05:52.221 --> 05:55.050
She played cello
for the philharmonic.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.573
He was a cardiologist.

05:56.660 --> 05:57.748
You never told me this.

05:57.835 --> 05:58.923
Oh, yeah.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.186
They offered me $25,000 for you.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.362
Why didn't you take it?

06:02.449 --> 06:05.365
They sound fantastic.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.019
Well, they were,
but you were my baby girl.

06:08.106 --> 06:08.237
I loved you.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.154
If you really loved me,

06:12.241 --> 06:15.244
you would've sold me
to the Lowensteins.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.160
Maybe if they'd gone to 30.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.077
I've made a decision.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.473
I'm gonna be a mom.

06:28.605 --> 06:29.345
Eek.

06:31.303 --> 06:34.394
Okay.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.961
Well, then,

06:37.048 --> 06:38.441
congratulations.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.140
We're having a baby.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.969
I'm so happy
for you, Violet.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.841
Thanks.And the great thing

06:46.928 --> 06:49.191
about having a baby so
young is after a few years,

06:49.278 --> 06:51.498
you can tell people
the kid's your sibling.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.543
Right, sis?

06:56.285 --> 06:58.418
That's not as cute
as you think it is.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.293
Uh, couple of questions.

07:04.380 --> 07:07.644
What about high school?

07:07.731 --> 07:09.124
What about it?

07:09.211 --> 07:10.691
The baby won't be born
till after I graduate,

07:10.778 --> 07:12.344
so it shouldn't
be a problem.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.696
Eek.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.307
I guess the next thing
to do is call Luke.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.352
You think he's
the father?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.484
I know he's the father.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.443
How about that?
Old-school.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.142
Grandma!

07:27.229 --> 07:28.143
Ah, ah, ah.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.318
Aunt Bonnie.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.059
There's my boy.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.714
Why do you have
glitter on your shirt?

07:33.801 --> 07:35.367
Dad took me
to his girlfriend's apartment.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.239
I learned how to swing
on a pole.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.460
He's a natural.

07:42.810 --> 07:45.465
I thought your girlfriend worked
at Bed, Bath and Beyond?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.597
Doesn't mean she can't dream.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.425
Okay.

07:49.512 --> 07:52.472
Go wash the sad lady
off your hands.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.300
[sighs]

07:55.387 --> 07:56.388
Thanks for taking him
this afternoon.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.826
Hey, I'm his dad.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.219
If I can't spend two hours
a week with him, who can?

08:01.306 --> 08:02.438
It's not always great

08:02.525 --> 08:05.354
knowing who the father is.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.709
Why is my son pregnant?

08:18.802 --> 08:20.543
[sighs]

08:20.630 --> 08:24.329
Well, that's a window
into a dark room.

08:25.592 --> 08:26.375
Sorry.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.160
You okay?

08:29.247 --> 08:30.205
I'm fine.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.554
Come on.

08:31.641 --> 08:32.554
Okay.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.514
Well, I just found out

08:34.601 --> 08:37.342
my teenage daughter is pregnant.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.996
Really? Wow.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.565
She's not a cheerleader
with an overbite, is she?

08:44.611 --> 08:46.787
No. Why?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.832
No reason.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.357
Okay.

08:52.444 --> 08:53.924
Nice talking to you, Chef Rudy.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.536
Stay strong, waitress whose name
I do not know.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.540
Thank God.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.501
Here we are.

09:05.588 --> 09:06.850
Oh.
[clears throat]

09:06.937 --> 09:07.634
How is the Chardonnay?

09:07.721 --> 09:08.504
It is delicious.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.375
Good choice.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.900
Oh, yeah, back in the day,

09:12.987 --> 09:16.338
I could get lost
in a bottle of this stuff.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.427
One time, I woke up
in a Best Western hotel

09:18.514 --> 09:21.256
with two of the roadies
from Counting Crows.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.129
But I'm sure
that won't happen to you.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.567
Uh, bon appÃ©tit.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.833
Hey.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.095
Hey.

09:36.097 --> 09:36.750
I miss you.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.578
Oh, thanks.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.495
You miss me?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.541
Yeah, sure, I guess.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.804
Well, that's not
very encouraging.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.894
I'm sorry. I got
a lot on my mind.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.331
Well, I'm a good listener.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.595
A penny for your thoughts?

09:57.727 --> 10:00.121
Okay, fine. How's this?

10:00.208 --> 10:03.341
I'm working my ass off so I
can take care of my children,

10:03.428 --> 10:05.430
I just found out I'm gonna
be a freaking grandma,

10:05.517 --> 10:07.171
and the man that
I'm sleeping with

10:07.258 --> 10:08.695
only has time for me when
his wife is out of town,

10:08.782 --> 10:11.088
and I desperately want
to run away from it all

10:11.175 --> 10:12.829
with a bottle of this,
but I can't

10:12.916 --> 10:13.961
because my name is Christy
and I'm an alcoholic.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.615
Hola, Christy.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.403
MAN [over stereo]:
In this moment,
my life is perfect.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.405
[sighs]

10:23.492 --> 10:25.146
In this moment,

10:25.233 --> 10:26.538
my life is perfect.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.584
I breathe in love.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.412
I breathe out fear.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.023
I breathe in love.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.546
I breathe out fear.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.722
[knocking]

10:35.809 --> 10:37.245
[screams, horn honks]

10:39.769 --> 10:41.641
Ah, I...

10:41.728 --> 10:43.468
didn't see you there, Luke.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.600
I could tell.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.993
How's it going?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.821
Pretty good.
Um, Violet texted me

10:47.908 --> 10:49.997
that we needed to talk,
so I came right over after work,

10:50.084 --> 10:51.085
and I brought sliders.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.348
Yum.

10:53.435 --> 10:55.002
They give us the ones
that smell iffy.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.135
Double yum.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.920
Yeah, it's a pretty sweet perk.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.662
So how was your day?

11:02.749 --> 11:03.793
Not great.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.229
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.404
Mine's been awesome.

11:06.491 --> 11:07.797
I got promoted
to shift manager

11:07.884 --> 11:10.321
and found five dollars
in the men's room.

11:10.408 --> 11:10.713
It wasn't even that wet.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.586
You're on fire.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.066
Right?

11:17.807 --> 11:19.330
Come on in.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.681
Let's see what the rest
of your life looks like.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.293
Hey, Vi.
Hi, Luke.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.642
Um, I'd kiss you,
but I don't want your mom

11:26.729 --> 11:28.557
to get the wrong idea
about me.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.736
[quietly]:
Has that ship sailed.

11:33.823 --> 11:34.998
So, what's going on?

11:35.085 --> 11:37.653
Well, I got some
kind of big news.

11:37.740 --> 11:38.872
Cool. What?

11:38.959 --> 11:40.656
Okay, um...

11:40.743 --> 11:42.049
Violet, wait.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.704
Luke, can you
give us a minute?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.270
Sure. I'll nuke
these bad boys

11:46.357 --> 11:47.794
so we don't get
the squirts.

11:49.621 --> 11:52.276
Isn't he amazing?

11:52.363 --> 11:55.671
Yeah.

11:55.758 --> 11:59.196
I just think it's important
that you understand

11:59.283 --> 12:02.373
he might not have the maturity
to deal with this situation.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.723
I'm just gonna hit
the popcorn button

12:03.810 --> 12:04.985
and see what happens.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.773
Luke loves me. I love him.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.340
We're gonna make this work.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.559
Honey, I just don't want you
to get hurt.

12:14.646 --> 12:17.737
Young guys spook real easy,

12:17.824 --> 12:19.739
and you can't count on them
sticking around.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.132
Whoa.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.699
I think I know what
you wanted to tell me.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.006
You do?

12:26.093 --> 12:27.703
Yeah.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.618
You're having a baby.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.232
So close.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.106
Violet?

12:40.672 --> 12:43.327
Luke, I'm having a baby.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.200
Wait.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.942
So you're both pregnant?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.773
No, just me.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.557
Oh.

12:55.644 --> 13:00.431
Well, that's...

13:00.518 --> 13:01.781
so cool!

13:03.652 --> 13:05.828
There's still time for you.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.917
Not much, but keep at it.

13:09.440 --> 13:09.832
Thank you.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.403
So you're not gonna get
scared and run off?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.144
Why would I run off?

13:17.231 --> 13:19.799
I love you,
and I'm gonna love your baby.

13:19.886 --> 13:23.759
Um, it's our baby.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.631
What?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.247
Even better!

13:40.602 --> 13:42.734
That's why I get so frustrated
with the people at work.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.956
[quietly]:
I slept with that guy.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.653
Really?

13:48.740 --> 13:51.831
He cries when he finishes.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.137
What do you mean?

13:54.224 --> 13:55.965
Like a happy cry?
No.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.619
More like a...

13:57.706 --> 13:59.708
[sobs in low voice]

14:03.320 --> 14:05.932
And that tiny dude over there
in the red shirt?

14:06.019 --> 14:08.064
Did you sleep
with him, too?

14:08.151 --> 14:09.979
Well, I wasn't going to at first
because of our height disparity,

14:10.066 --> 14:13.461
and then I decided to do it
anyway as, like, a good deed.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.378
That's how you
get into Heaven:

14:17.465 --> 14:21.164
letting a little
guy go up on you.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.688
I wish. All he wanted to do
was spank me.

14:25.908 --> 14:29.433
Well, no good deed
goes unpunished.

14:29.520 --> 14:33.481
I had to sit
on my hip for a week.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.613
So how many men at this
meeting have you slept with?

14:35.700 --> 14:37.572
Oh, please,
this is a sacred space

14:37.659 --> 14:38.660
dedicated to recovery
and healing.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.880
Six.

14:44.405 --> 14:45.797
WOMAN:
Anyone else like to share?

14:45.885 --> 14:49.192
Oh, me.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.978
Haven't you shared enough?

14:52.065 --> 14:53.240
Hi. I'm Bonnie,

14:53.327 --> 14:54.719
and I'm an alcoholic.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.547
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.I just want

14:56.634 --> 14:58.332
to start by saying how grateful
I am to this program.

14:58.419 --> 15:02.249
Not only am I happily sober,
but so is my daughter.

15:02.336 --> 15:05.078
And let me tell you,
she was a hot mess.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.557
Come on.
Stand up, honey.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.776
Let everybody see
how pretty you are now.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.563
Imagine her without the bangs.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.177
P.S. She's single, fellas.

15:18.656 --> 15:19.657
Not for you, Spanky.

15:21.703 --> 15:24.140
Anyhow, it's just a real gift
to have her back in my life.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.012
And, uh, I know
I wasn't the world's

15:26.099 --> 15:27.578
greatest mom
when she was growing up,

15:27.665 --> 15:29.885
what with all my drinking
and drugging and dealing

15:29.972 --> 15:31.321
and managing
an international escort service

15:31.408 --> 15:33.802
with ties
to the Russian mob, but...

15:33.889 --> 15:37.197
You know, it's hard
to have a career and be a mom.

15:37.284 --> 15:38.415
Am I right, ladies?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.899
I remember this one time,
she was five years old.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.814
Maybe she was 11.
The point is she was little.

15:45.901 --> 15:48.860
And I pulled her out of school,
moved us up to Manitoba

15:48.948 --> 15:50.732
where I opened up
a daycare center

15:50.819 --> 15:54.301
that was a front
for an Ecstasy distribution hub.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.042
It worked out really well

15:56.129 --> 15:59.871
until one Mountie
had to be a freaking hero.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.440
You are so lucky
to have her for a mother.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.355
You don't have to tell me.

16:05.442 --> 16:06.443
She's a...
I mean it!

16:06.530 --> 16:07.749
You don't have to tell me.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.362
Don't get me wrong.
I love Canada.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.885
Hey, remember Canadian beer?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.975
Wasn't that great?

16:20.936 --> 16:23.417
Hello?

16:23.504 --> 16:23.808
Violet?

16:28.378 --> 16:30.163
Did you finish
your homework?
Yep.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.903
Did you brush
your teeth?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.340
I think so.

16:33.427 --> 16:34.950
Mmm, what do you mean,
you "think so"?

16:35.037 --> 16:36.386
My brain is full.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.041
I'm worried
about the Middle East.

16:39.128 --> 16:40.347
VIOLET:
All right,
you'll brush

16:40.434 --> 16:42.001
twice as long
in the morning.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.132
Get in there.

16:44.481 --> 16:44.916
Middle East.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.402
Want to know a secret?

16:52.489 --> 16:53.403
Sure.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.579
You're gonna be an uncle.

16:55.666 --> 16:56.754
Cool.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.887
Do you know
what that means?

16:58.974 --> 17:00.932
Yeah. I'm your boyfriend
and I get to sleep over.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.241
No, that's a different kind
of uncle.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.939
It means
that I'm gonna have a baby.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.029
Really?

17:10.116 --> 17:12.422
A human baby?

17:14.381 --> 17:16.731
I hope so.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.039
But I'm gonna need your help.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.431
With what?

17:21.518 --> 17:22.824
Taking care of the baby.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.305
Oh, sure.
I'll take good care of it

17:25.392 --> 17:27.436
like you take good care of me.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.787
You're gonna be
a great uncle.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.702
ROSCOE:
I have a secret, too.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.269
VIOLET:
What's that?

17:33.356 --> 17:35.619
I haven't brushed my teeth
in three days.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.056
You little stinker!

17:40.972 --> 17:43.410
Mom?

17:43.497 --> 17:44.498
[sobbing softly]

17:44.585 --> 17:46.848
What's wrong?

17:49.285 --> 17:51.505
You're a better mother
than I am.

17:54.421 --> 17:54.943
I know.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.952
You're gonna love
my gynecologist.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.172
He's got very small hands.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.697
Like an Asian raccoon.

18:09.784 --> 18:10.872
Mom, please!

18:15.268 --> 18:17.008
I'm gonna be an uncle.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.228
Unless it's a girl.
Then I'll be an aunt.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.841
I respect
your open-mindedness.

18:23.928 --> 18:28.107
Gotta give this kid Luke
points for showing up.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.457
He claims he loves her.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.980
Well, we'll see.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.416
I had three significant
relationships end

18:33.503 --> 18:34.896
while I was pregnant
with you, so...

18:39.248 --> 18:40.815
Christy?

18:40.902 --> 18:42.208
Carla?

18:42.295 --> 18:43.687
Hi.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.776
I haven't seen you
since high school.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.561
Yeah, hi!

18:47.648 --> 18:49.737
Wow! Look at you.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.913
Yeah, finally getting around
to starting a family.

18:52.000 --> 18:52.914
And you?

18:53.001 --> 18:55.046
I, uh...

18:55.134 --> 18:58.441
I'm fighting
a nasty yeast infection.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.488
And with the support

19:01.575 --> 19:05.144
of her entire family,
she will win this battle.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.195
Am I right?

19:13.282 --> 19:14.849
Oh, come on.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.419
And there is your baby.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.162
Wow.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.339
Luke, look what we made.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.949
Unreal.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.038
I can't wait for it
to grow feet

19:30.125 --> 19:33.041
so I can make
moccasins for it.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.434
Mom, come here.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.873
I'm gonna need your help.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.135
I'll be here.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.490
Mom?

19:49.362 --> 19:50.972
I'm gonna need your help.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.192
I'm not going
anywhere.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.501
"Clitoris."

20:08.163 --> 20:11.732
[humming]

20:11.819 --> 20:13.603
Well, someone's in a good mood.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.997
You know, I am.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.912
I am just loving my life
right now.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.088
Mmm. Cocaine?

20:22.656 --> 20:23.091
Family.

20:24.092 --> 20:26.050
Family.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.183
That stuff will kill you.
