we would remain.

13:48.072 --> 13:50.828
"Impressions" was identical
to an original piece

13:50.853 --> 13:53.979
of Izabella's called "Miss Remembered."

13:54.004 --> 13:55.261
Dimo: It is very different.

13:55.286 --> 13:58.658
This piece is two people,
not one, very different.

13:58.683 --> 14:00.650
That paint was black. This was blue.

14:00.675 --> 14:02.547
Blue is different than black.

Jessen: The art world was always drawn

14:04.471 --> 14:06.573
to the story of Dimo and Izabella.

14:06.598 --> 14:08.261
Their work always made you wonder

14:08.286 --> 14:10.826
what their relationship must be like.

14:24.642 --> 14:28.514
Dimo insisted that, you know,
in spite of our success,

14:28.539 --> 14:33.471
that we should drive around Europe
in this... this old van.

14:33.496 --> 14:35.900
It was, you know, it was very old, very...

14:35.925 --> 14:37.066
It was very beat up.

14:37.091 --> 14:40.447
We would perform and drive,
and Dimo would pick a spot for us

14:40.472 --> 14:42.860
to park the van for the night, and...

14:42.885 --> 14:44.622
and then we would make love,

14:44.647 --> 14:49.387
and because this van was really so small,
we would...

14:49.412 --> 14:50.498
Well, I would sleep in the back,

14:50.523 --> 14:53.092
and he would sleep out under the stars...

14:56.803 --> 14:58.264
...which I know now is not true,

14:58.289 --> 15:02.913
but, you know, it was actually... it was...

15:02.938 --> 15:05.437
It was lovely thing to believe.

15:05.462 --> 15:09.269
Dimo almost always parked
near a five-star hotel.

15:09.294 --> 15:10.971
He would get a room for the night

15:10.996 --> 15:13.491
while Izabella slept in the van.

15:13.516 --> 15:16.265
This was also when the infidelities began.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.886
Izabella, she had asked
that we be monogamous,

15:19.911 --> 15:23.286
and I said yes, and true to my word,

15:23.311 --> 15:28.264
I was always monogamous
when I was with her.

15:28.289 --> 15:32.000
It was the other times that I was not,

15:32.025 --> 15:38.652
and still, for whatever reason,
she considered it a betrayal.

15:38.677 --> 15:40.089
Women.

15:40.114 --> 15:42.771
Their breakup was very painful
for Izabella,

15:42.796 --> 15:44.936
but instead of dealing with it in private,

15:44.961 --> 15:47.647
she offered to make it a public moment.

15:47.675 --> 15:50.848
Jessen: Their breakup performance
was called "Stairwell."

15:50.849 --> 15:53.905
Izabella started at the bottom
of the Empire State Building,

15:53.930 --> 15:58.465
and Dimo was at the top,
and they were wearing ski boots.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.616
Barta: What was important, I think for me,

16:00.641 --> 16:03.979
was that we passed each other
exactly the halfway

16:04.004 --> 16:06.010
because I believe that we had, in the end,

16:06.035 --> 16:07.915
we had given the same to each other.

16:07.940 --> 16:09.818
They did not pass halfway.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.334
Dimo stopped a few times
to have a cigarette,

16:12.359 --> 16:14.782
and then he flirted
with a couple of secretaries.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.895
You both have beautiful eyes.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.260
I don't know who is the better.
I'd say that it's a tie.

16:18.285 --> 16:19.959
It's a even tie.

16:19.984 --> 16:22.523
And when he realized he was running behind,

16:22.548 --> 16:25.238
he exited the stairwell
to take the elevator.

16:25.263 --> 16:28.232
But by the time he made it
to the 51st floor,

16:28.257 --> 16:30.188
she had already passed it.

16:30.213 --> 16:33.077
So he sat waiting while she continued on.

16:33.102 --> 16:34.540
She climbed every step.

16:34.565 --> 16:37.918
By the time she reached the top,
he was asleep.

16:37.943 --> 16:40.674
The sad thing is,
she was never the same as an artist,

16:40.699 --> 16:43.200
and I blame myself for that, of course,

16:43.225 --> 16:48.666

17:04.546 --> 17:07.507
We've been preparing a book
to go along with her retrospective.

17:07.531 --> 17:10.839
It's been arduous
because Izabella is very particular.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.402
Today, this book arrived in stores.

17:13.426 --> 17:15.259
It's written by Dimo.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.042
She has been on the floor ever since,

17:17.068 --> 17:19.089
still no idea for her show.

17:19.115 --> 17:22.398

17:22.424 --> 17:24.824
I would worry now.

17:24.848 --> 17:26.626
Dimo: Well, this is the book.

17:26.651 --> 17:29.918
It came out good.

17:29.943 --> 17:31.211
Um...

17:31.236 --> 17:34.056
Well, there is no courage in offending

17:34.081 --> 17:38.958
unless you are also willing
to offend those you love.

17:38.983 --> 17:43.739
And I hope that that will be
a famous quote someday.

17:43.764 --> 17:45.679
It frustrates me that Izabella

17:45.704 --> 17:48.698
doesn't value her post-Dimo work more.

17:48.723 --> 17:52.027
There was so much great work in that era,

17:52.052 --> 17:55.156
like "Ein Tag, Ein Frankfurter," for one.

17:55.181 --> 17:59.861

"Ein Tag, Ein Frankfurter,"

at it today,

18:09.978 --> 18:13.384

one hot dog a day,

18:13.409 --> 18:16.259

18:16.284 --> 18:17.619
Barta: So there were two key elements

18:17.644 --> 18:20.047
to performing "Ein Tag, Ein Frankfurter."

18:20.072 --> 18:23.629
The first was to imagine
that each day was my last,

18:26.435 --> 18:27.538

So I had to savor every single moment
