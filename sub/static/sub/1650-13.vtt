02:04.625 --> 02:06.741
(tapping )

02:10.381 --> 02:12.497
( clicks )

02:35.656 --> 02:37.647
( metal rattles )

02:39.035 --> 02:40.525
( footsteps )

03:16.906 --> 03:19.363
We have a lotto talk about.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.208
(theme music playing )

04:03.661 --> 04:05.822
You attacked us.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.952
Makes things pretty clear.

04:08.124 --> 04:09.955
I was trying
to make things clear.

04:10.126 --> 04:13.368
I could have killed you all.
I didn't.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.333
And here we are.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.335
I'm gonna remove my weapon.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.596
Show that I mean
to negotiate in good faith.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.848
I'd like you
to do the same.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.268
May I?

04:52.418 --> 04:55.000
See?

04:55.171 --> 04:57.162
No trouble.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.627
Now you.

05:13.898 --> 05:15.684
Well...

05:15.858 --> 05:17.689
suit yourself.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.441
( chuckles )

05:35.461 --> 05:36.951
He's already in there.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.620
Sat down with Rick.

05:43.052 --> 05:45.088
I don't see any cars.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.344
It don't feel right.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.597
Keep it running.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.142
(car approaching )

05:54.313 --> 05:56.804
Heads up.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.075
What the hell? Why's your boy
already in there?

06:17.253 --> 06:19.744
- He's here?
- Yup.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.874
(sighs)

06:31.767 --> 06:34.509
- What's going on?
- Governor: Nothing.

06:34.687 --> 06:37.349
Your friend isn't much
for small talk.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.390
You want to talk, talk.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.900
I wanted you to talk.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.777
Too many people have died
for no reason.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.813
Let's end this.

06:47.992 --> 06:50.278
Save the bullets
for the real threat.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.239
We can solve this.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.531
That's why I asked you
to come here.

06:56.709 --> 06:59.200
I know what you've done.

06:59.378 --> 07:02.870
I heard about
the raids, the heads,

07:03.048 --> 07:05.255
- Maggie.
- Merle did that.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.259
No. You know what
I'm talking about.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.590
You know all about me
and I know all about you.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.425
I don't care about
any of that.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.761
We're here to move forward.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.117
Maybe I should
go inside.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.280
The Governor thought it best
if he and Rick spoke privately.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.744
Who the hell are you?

07:39.918 --> 07:42.000
Milton Mamet.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.628
Great.
He brought his butler.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.335
- ( chuckles )
- l'm his advisor.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.420
Daryl:
What kind of advice?

07:49.595 --> 07:51.836
Planning. Biters.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.800
Uh, you know, I'm sorry.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.465
I don't feel like I need to explain
myself to the henchmen.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.134
You better watch
your mouth, sunshine.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.301
Look, if you and l are gonna
be out here

07:59.480 --> 08:01.311
pointing guns
at each other all day,

08:01.482 --> 08:04.474
do me a favor,
shut your mouth.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.478
We don't need this.
If all goes south in there,

08:09.657 --> 08:11.989
we'll be at each other's
throats soon enough.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.584
Glenn:
Carl, come here.

08:33.806 --> 08:36.047
You stash these
at the loading dock. All right?

08:36.225 --> 08:38.511
Beth, put more
up on the catwalk.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.766
If anyone gets pinned down,

08:39.937 --> 08:41.928
we need to make sure that
they have plenty of ammo.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.184
I'll go work on
the cage outside.

08:45.359 --> 08:49.022
What we should be doing is loading
some of this firepower

08:49.196 --> 08:52.108
in a truck and paying
a visit to the Governor.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.147
We know where he is
right now.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.317
Are you suggesting that
wejust go in and kill him?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.451
Yeah, lam.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.034
We told Rick and Daryl
that we'd stay put.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.039
I've changed my mind,
sweetheart.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.418
Being on the sideline
with my brother out there

09:06.588 --> 09:08.203
ain't sitting right
with me.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.418
Glenn: The three of them are right
in the middle of it.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.504
No idea we're coming. They could
get taken hostage or killed.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.215
A thousand things
could go wrong.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.550
And they will.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.967
My dad can take care
of himself.

09:21.145 --> 09:22.976
Sorry, son,
but your dad's head

09:23.147 --> 09:25.229
could be on a pike
real soon.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.893
Don't say that to him.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.441
It's not the right move.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.826
Not now.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.454
Can't take the risk
of putting them in the crossfire.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.706
That's my decision.
lt's final.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.837
I've known you both
at different times,

09:51.008 --> 09:53.169
but only after the world
went to shit.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.254
And you both stepped up
for the good of others

09:55.429 --> 09:56.885
at great personal risk.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.842
- There's no reason--
- Get to it.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.928
Woodbury takes
west of the river.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.434
The prison takes east.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.438
No one crosses,
no one trades.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.352
Andrea:
He's right.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.108
We should hammer out boundaries,
then leave each other--

10:12.279 --> 10:14.486
- I'm sorry, what is this?
- It's a solution.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.068
( laughs )
Absolutely not.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.743
What the hell am I doing here?
You told me--

10:18.911 --> 10:20.867
- Told him what?
- You told me he was willing to talk.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.905
I am,
but the truth is, Rick,

10:24.082 --> 10:27.074
she's in no position to make
such an offer anyway.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.959
I'm here
for one thing only--

10:30.130 --> 10:32.337
your surrender.

10:32.508 --> 10:33.998
Oh, you want surrender?
Come get it.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.337
You think we hit
Woodbury heavy last time?

10:36.512 --> 10:39.470
Just take it easy, all right?
We're here to settle this.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.256
You're right.
Would you step outside?

10:42.434 --> 10:43.469
What?

10:43.644 --> 10:44.929
Rick and l, we got
a lot to talk about.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.186
- I'm not leaving.
- I came to talk to him.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.691
So you're the Governor.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.403
That's-- that's their
term, not mine.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.192
Oh.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.452
But still,

11:45.622 --> 11:47.578
you're beholden
to your people.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.411
- Well, of course.
- You have responsibility to them.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.827
Mm-hmm.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.371
Wasn't Merle
your lieutenant?

11:55.549 --> 11:57.710
He was helpful, yeah.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.046
But you knew
he was erratic.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.217
You blame him for scooping up
Glenn and Maggie in the first place?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.882
Exactly. l was trying
to sort it out

12:07.060 --> 12:09.142
when you attacked.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.678
So it was his fault?

12:10.856 --> 12:13.017
He's a wild card,
but he's effective.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.855
He gets the dirty jobs done.

12:18.030 --> 12:21.818
I thought you'd take
responsibility.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.990
I thought you were a cop,
not a lawyer.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.619
Either way, I don't pretend
to be a governor.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.711
I told you,
I'm their leader.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.747
You're the town drunk

12:38.926 --> 12:42.760
who knocked over my fence
and ripped up my yard,

12:42.930 --> 12:45.262
nothing more.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.634
Didn't you ever
misjudge someone?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.434
Hmm?

12:55.609 --> 12:57.850
Andrea told me
about your baby.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.526
That it might be
your partner's.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.113
But you're caring for her
and I admire that.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.404
Restitution for your
own lack of insight.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.284
For failing to see
the devil beside you.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.296
Oh, I see him, all right.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.585
( laughs)

13:31.520 --> 13:33.431
I brought whiskey.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.106
( laughs)

13:48.120 --> 13:49.610
( exhales )

13:54.084 --> 13:57.167
There's no reason not to use
this time we have together

13:57.337 --> 13:59.498
to explore the issues
ourselves.

13:59.673 --> 14:03.461
- Boss said to sit tight and shut up.
- Don't you mean the Governor?

14:03.635 --> 14:05.591
It's a good thing
they're sitting down,

14:05.762 --> 14:07.798
especially after
what happened.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.305
They're gonna work it out.
Nobody wants another battle.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.851
I wouldn't exactly
call it a battle.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.136
lwould call it
a battle and I did.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.349
I recorded it.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.855
For what?

14:19.026 --> 14:21.142
Somebody's got to keep a record
of what we've gone through.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.820
It'll be a part
of our history.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.024
That makes sense.

14:25.198 --> 14:29.191
I've got dozens
of interviews--

14:29.369 --> 14:31.075
- ( metal clangs)
- ( walkers snarling )

14:35.959 --> 14:37.699
(walkers growling )

14:42.924 --> 14:44.915
(walkers snarling )

14:50.390 --> 14:52.051
After you.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.056
No way.
You first.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.604
(sighs)

14:56.772 --> 14:58.228
( roars )

15:02.402 --> 15:04.393
Pussy.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.753
(sighs)

15:49.658 --> 15:51.819
Look what he's got.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.783
Nah, I prefer menthols.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.952
Douchebag.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.632
You army or something?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.762
Nah, ljust--

16:14.933 --> 16:16.798
just hate these things.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.308
Yeah.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.685
After what they did

16:20.856 --> 16:23.939
to my wife, kids.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.817
Sucks.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.150
Thanks.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.322
This is ajoke, right?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.286
They ain't gonna
work anything out.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.870
Sure, they'll do
their little dance

16:44.045 --> 16:46.878
and tomorrow,
next day...

16:49.009 --> 16:50.749
they'll give the word.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.918
I know.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.548
Hey.

17:04.316 --> 17:07.183
May | ask how
you lost your leg?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.612
l was bit.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.771
So you cut off your leg

17:12.949 --> 17:15.691
to keep the infection
from spreading?

17:15.869 --> 17:17.450
Interesting.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.987
How long after
the initial bite?

17:20.165 --> 17:22.030
Immediately.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.540
You didn't bleed out?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.871
We have good people.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.707
They took care of me.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.496
Doctors?

17:29.674 --> 17:31.050
No.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.379
We learned
by trial and error.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.677
Me, too.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.552
May | see it?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.266
Your stump.
I'd like to, um...

17:45.440 --> 17:48.432
ahem, see where
the amputation was.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.396
How high above the bite.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.061
I'm not showing you
my leg.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.526
It's important data.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.031
ljust met you.

17:57.202 --> 18:00.069
At least buy me
a drink first.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.579
( laughs)

18:15.387 --> 18:16.752
I care about my people

18:16.930 --> 18:18.295
and I don't take
their deaths lightly,

18:18.473 --> 18:20.259
and I know
you don't either.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.515
In a way, this fight,

18:22.686 --> 18:24.096
it's a failure
of leadership.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.602
Then leave us alone.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.263
Well, now, that would be
an even bigger failure.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.813
You've moved into
our backyard.

18:32.988 --> 18:35.229
You shot up Main Street.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.648
If I let that threat
persist, I look weak

18:37.826 --> 18:39.817
and, well,
the whole thing crumbles.

18:39.995 --> 18:42.828
Well, that's your problem.
Your choice.

18:42.998 --> 18:45.535
Now, isn't that
why we're here?

18:45.709 --> 18:48.075
Choice.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.297
If we choose to destroy

18:55.468 --> 18:58.960
everything we've fought for
over the past year...

19:04.436 --> 19:07.052
we're gonna kill
everyone we know.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.973
At your prison.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.267
Back in Woodbury.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.983
People we love, Rick.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.455
l was at work one day

19:31.629 --> 19:34.120
taking shit from a boss
half my age

19:34.299 --> 19:37.257
and an IQ even lower.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.793
And the phone rang.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.758
My wife had been
in an accident.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.179
"Sorry, Mr. Blake, we did
everything we could."

19:50.190 --> 19:53.023
| sat there
holding that phone,

19:53.193 --> 19:56.777
knowing that I would
never see her again.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.615
- ( snaps fingers)
- Gone.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.869
It was just an accident.
No one's fault.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.917
She had left a voicemail
asking me to call her,

20:13.088 --> 20:15.704
but I hadn't had
a chance yet.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.670
| sat there clutching
that phone thinking,

20:19.844 --> 20:21.926
"What did she want?"

20:25.767 --> 20:28.759
Just to check in?

20:33.316 --> 20:35.853
Ask me to pick
something up for dinner?

20:45.078 --> 20:47.069
What did she want?

21:16.317 --> 21:18.774
(walkers snarling )

21:25.827 --> 21:27.567
(grunts)

21:52.353 --> 21:55.015
Hey, you're not going.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.393
- I can't let you.
- You can't stop me.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.153
If you're gonna live here with us,
it's gonna be on our terms.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.782
lf Michonne can do it,
why can't you?

22:07.952 --> 22:11.115
'Cause it's my brother
out there, that's why.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.371
What's the matter
with y'all?

22:17.295 --> 22:19.331
I'm not gonna let you
put them in danger.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.623
Nut up already, boy.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.132
This guy cops a feel
of your woman

22:25.303 --> 22:28.170
and you pussy out
like this?

22:28.348 --> 22:30.213
Get out of my way.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.892
No.

22:34.062 --> 22:36.678
- Get out of my way!
- ( shouting )

22:41.402 --> 22:43.734
Maggie:
Get up!

22:43.905 --> 22:46.191
Get up!

22:46.366 --> 22:47.902
(gunshot)

22:53.998 --> 22:57.991
Let me go!
Let me go!

23:04.050 --> 23:05.881
If you'll excuse me.

23:27.490 --> 23:30.357
How's it going in there?

23:30.535 --> 23:32.651
They kicked me out.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.074
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.243
You're trying to help.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.499
What happened with Maggie?

23:49.304 --> 23:51.169
He's a sick man.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.852
What am I gonna do now?

24:06.613 --> 24:09.980
I can't go back there.

24:10.158 --> 24:13.491
We're family.
You belong with us.

24:16.164 --> 24:18.280
But if you join us,

24:18.458 --> 24:20.449
it's settled.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.039
I know.

24:42.732 --> 24:45.314
You know, the truth is
I didn't want any of this.

24:46.569 --> 24:49.231
They chose me because
there was nobody else around.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.691
( chuckles )

24:51.866 --> 24:53.777
And they still think
that I'm the man

24:53.951 --> 24:56.442
that can keep them safe.

24:56.621 --> 24:58.577
They still think
I know what I'm doing.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.498
I know you got guns.

25:09.676 --> 25:13.510
Mmm. That was quite a stash you
brought back the other day.

25:16.224 --> 25:19.682
Now, my people, they're not
combat-tested like yours are,

25:19.852 --> 25:22.434
but I've got more of them.

25:23.731 --> 25:27.019
So this fight, it will
go down to the last man.

25:31.114 --> 25:34.072
So let's end it.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.823
Today.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.322
Let's not do this.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.704
We can walk away.

25:47.422 --> 25:50.880
You have something

25:51.050 --> 25:53.086
that I want.

25:54.887 --> 25:58.175
One thing that makes
this all all right.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.055
I'm not giving up
the prison.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.057
( laughs )
No.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.344
No, |--

26:04.522 --> 26:07.059
I don't want your prison.
That doesn't sound safe at all.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.645
I mean, you lost your wife,
another man.

26:09.819 --> 26:11.775
We're not moving on.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.686
What good would that do me?

26:13.865 --> 26:16.777
Best you stay where I can
keep my one good eye on you.

26:35.303 --> 26:37.385
I want Michonne.

26:37.555 --> 26:40.513
Turn her over
and this all goes away.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.059
Is she worth it?

26:48.483 --> 26:50.348
One woman...

26:51.944 --> 26:55.778
worth all those lives
atyourpﬁson?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.992
Is she?

27:20.181 --> 27:21.671
You know I'm right.

27:24.185 --> 27:26.050
The folks here,

27:26.229 --> 27:28.060
they're strong,

27:28.231 --> 27:30.142
good fighters.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.062
But they ain't killers.

27:34.237 --> 27:36.353
Rick is.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.487
Maggie is.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.114
Carl put down
his own mother.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.615
Mercy killing.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.617
That don't make him
an assassin.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.574
Mmm, but you are.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.114
( chuckles )
When I have to be.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.328
Then how do you explain
letting me get away?

27:50.503 --> 27:52.539
I must have been seduced

27:52.713 --> 27:55.671
by your sterling
personality.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.293
You coming with me or not?

28:00.471 --> 28:03.804
Me and my brother, we have a few
calls we use when we hunt.

28:03.975 --> 28:06.011
I'll give him a heads up.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.971
He'll warn the others.

28:08.145 --> 28:10.352
You shogun
the Governor's ass,

28:10.523 --> 28:11.933
I'll take care of the rest.

28:12.108 --> 28:15.817
We'll be home
before you know it.

28:15.987 --> 28:17.443
And what about Andrea?

28:17.613 --> 28:22.198
Bullets fly, she's gonna have
to make her choice real quick.

28:24.745 --> 28:26.656
You're on your own.

28:26.831 --> 28:29.698
You get people killed,
it's on you.

28:39.468 --> 28:42.050
( door opens, closes)

28:44.849 --> 28:47.340
(snarling )

28:50.271 --> 28:52.683
( door opens)

28:57.737 --> 28:59.568
Hey.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.900
I thought it was
my watch.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.860
I got it.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.903
Keep you company?

29:26.015 --> 29:28.256
That was a hell
of a choke hold.

29:28.434 --> 29:31.722
I should have
put him to sleep.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.237
When we got back
from Woodbury...

29:45.117 --> 29:47.449
I made it all about me.

29:47.620 --> 29:50.612
And you needed your space
and I didn't give you that.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.951
I didn't need
my space from you.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.616
(sighs)

29:55.795 --> 29:57.831
ljust...

29:58.005 --> 30:00.041
wanted you to see me.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.257
( laughs)

30:07.431 --> 30:09.137
I'm with you.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.175
I'm always with you,
you know?

30:14.939 --> 30:16.600
I'm sorry.

30:16.774 --> 30:18.685
I know.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.396
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

30:25.783 --> 30:28.820
Oh, God, I love you.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.781
I love you.

30:46.595 --> 30:47.926
(walkers snarling )

30:48.097 --> 30:50.804
- Wait.
-Hmm?

30:50.975 --> 30:52.886
I can't do this.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.517
(snarling )

31:02.862 --> 31:05.103
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

31:21.672 --> 31:23.208
- Ow!
- You okay?

31:23.382 --> 31:25.668
(laughing)

31:29.055 --> 31:31.546
(laughing)

31:39.482 --> 31:41.393
( exhales )

31:54.246 --> 31:56.828
(moaning)

32:10.721 --> 32:12.507
Yeah, I don't get it.

32:12.681 --> 32:15.548
You've obviously
got big plans.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.478
Like you're the guy
who's gonna lick this thing.

32:21.774 --> 32:24.481
Bring us back
from the brink.

32:24.652 --> 32:28.941
So why waste your time
on a two-bit vendetta?

32:29.115 --> 32:31.652
Why risk it all?

32:31.826 --> 32:33.817
You could have
a statue of yourself

32:33.994 --> 32:37.612
in the town square,
Governor.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.997
Killing Michonne

32:44.171 --> 32:48.130
is sort of beneath you,
don't you think?

32:48.300 --> 32:50.416
You could save your son.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.465
Save your daughter.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.428
Everyone you know.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.850
It's your choice.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.997
If I give you Michonne,

33:22.168 --> 33:24.875
how do I know
you'll keep your word

33:25.045 --> 33:26.876
that you'll stop?

33:35.181 --> 33:37.593
You can have
everything you want.

33:37.766 --> 33:40.018
I told you,
I don't care about you.

33:46.275 --> 33:48.015
You think about it.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.399
Two days.

33:54.992 --> 33:57.028
I'll be here at noon.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.235
(engines start)

35:02.101 --> 35:04.092
(snarling )

35:28.085 --> 35:31.327
J‘ What you got
going on? J‘

35:32.881 --> 35:36.373
J‘ High notes,
eyes closed J‘

35:36.552 --> 35:38.383
J‘ Holding on J‘

35:41.765 --> 35:44.552
J‘ And I don't want another J‘

35:47.187 --> 35:49.178
J‘ Day to break J‘

35:50.816 --> 35:54.149
IMmmI

35:54.320 --> 35:56.106
J‘ Take our J‘

35:56.280 --> 35:59.488
J‘ Steal our night away... J‘

36:07.333 --> 36:10.166
Let's get inside.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.622
Position gunmen
all around that feed store.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.787
The minute you see
Michonne, you open fire.

36:14.965 --> 36:17.297
Kill the others,
but you keep her alive.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.758
What about the deal?

36:20.929 --> 36:24.057
Well, they'll bring Rick,
Merle's brother,

36:24.224 --> 36:25.885
maybe Glenn,
Merle himself.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.051
We can take care
of the whole crew.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.514
It's the best way
to avoid a slaughter.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.764
That is a slaughter.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.067
Not at our end.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.861
We're gonna have to eliminate
Rick sooner or later.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.202
No way we can all live
side by side.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.462
Thanks for setting that up.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.468
You really put
yourself out there.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.550
Glad I could help.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.766
Rick and I set terms.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.347
He's gonna consider them

37:11.522 --> 37:15.231
and then we'll meet
again in two days.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.232
What sort of terms?

37:22.908 --> 37:24.899
Hope it works out.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.345
So, I met this Governor.

37:50.978 --> 37:53.435
Sat with him
for quite a while.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.436
Merle:
Just the two of you?

37:55.607 --> 37:56.938
Yeah.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.521
Should have gone
when we had the chance, bro.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.608
He wants the prison.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.947
He wants us gone.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.537
Dead.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.293
He wants us dead

38:18.464 --> 38:21.456
for what we did
to Woodbury.

38:33.437 --> 38:35.598
We're going to war.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.983
J‘ Warm shadow J‘

38:42.154 --> 38:46.272
J‘ What you got
in store for me? J‘

38:46.450 --> 38:49.317
J‘ Warm shadow J‘

38:49.495 --> 38:52.987
J‘ Eyes closed next to me J‘

38:57.586 --> 39:00.498
J‘ Warm shadow J‘

39:00.672 --> 39:03.880
J‘ What you got in store
for me? J‘

39:27.199 --> 39:31.192
The group's taking it
as well as can be expected.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.951
Merle and Michonne
are convinced

39:33.121 --> 39:35.248
we should hit first.

39:35.415 --> 39:39.784
Carol and I think we should take
our chances on the road.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.873
We're in this together.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.754
So if we stay and fight,

39:44.925 --> 39:46.586
so be it.

39:57.563 --> 40:00.555
He gave me a choice.

40:02.192 --> 40:05.309
A way out.

40:05.487 --> 40:07.478
What does he want?

40:09.616 --> 40:11.607
Michonne.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.073
He'll kill her.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.290
And then kill us anyway.

40:25.382 --> 40:27.589
But what if he doesn't?

40:28.885 --> 40:31.012
What if this is the answer?

40:36.518 --> 40:38.725
Why didn't you tell them?

40:40.897 --> 40:43.855
They need

40:44.026 --> 40:46.017
to be scared.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.188
They are.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.277
Good.

40:53.452 --> 40:56.444
'Cause that's the only way
they'll accept it.

41:00.876 --> 41:02.912
She saved my life.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.042
And Carl's.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.297
Glenn, Maggie--

41:09.468 --> 41:11.129
if she hadn't come here,

41:11.303 --> 41:13.464
we never would have known
they were taken.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.971
She's earned her place.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.972
Yeah.

41:19.728 --> 41:21.719
Yeah, she has.

41:31.156 --> 41:34.614
Are you willing to sacrifice
your daughters' lives for her?

41:42.292 --> 41:44.453
Why are you telling me?

41:46.963 --> 41:48.794
Because...

41:50.509 --> 41:53.091
I'm hoping you can
talk me out of it.

42:22.958 --> 42:25.370
(theme music playing )
