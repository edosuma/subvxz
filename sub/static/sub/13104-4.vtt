WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.828
(The Audition)
* I FEEL MY TEMPERATURE RISING *

00:03.870 --> 00:05.622
I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S THE EYES.

00:05.670 --> 00:08.195
THEY'RE THE WINDOWS TO THE SOUL.
EYES CAN'T LIE.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.606
YOU KNOW THEY SAY THAT 60%
OF MEN LOOK AT YOUR EYES FIRST?

00:10.640 --> 00:13.700
YEAH, WELL, 60% OF MEN
ARE LYING...

00:13.740 --> 00:15.833
WITH THEIR MOUTHS.
(pops lips)

00:15.880 --> 00:18.041
IT'S ALL ABOUT LIPS,
MCNALLY...

00:18.080 --> 00:20.014
BIG, RED LIPS. IT'S PRIMAL.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A--

00:20.050 --> 00:21.642
IT'S LIKE A MONKEY'S BU'I'I'.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.887
OH, THAT'S REALLY NICE.
THAT'S VERY APPEALING.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.512
JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.859
YOU WANT TO BE HONEST,
BE HONEST. BOOBS.

00:27.890 --> 00:30.029
ALL THAT OTHER STUFF
IS WINDOW DRESSING.

00:30.060 --> 00:32.392
OOH. THE DETECTIVE SPEAKS.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.590
DETECTIVE IN TRAINING.

00:33.630 --> 00:35.757
NOT TILL TOMORROW.

00:36.770 --> 00:37.919
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:37.970 --> 00:39.096
NOTHING.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.960
THAT'S NOT FOR ME.
THAT IS NOT HAPPENING.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.059
NO. I'M NOT GOING DANCING.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.738
TOMORROW'S MY FIRST DAY.
I HAVE TO WORK IN THE MORNING.
SO DO WE.

00:45.770 --> 00:47.237
SO WHAT? SHE DOESN'T WANT TO
CELEBRATE, THAT'S HER PROBLEM.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.999
COME ON. YOU HAVE WORKED
YOUR ASS OFF TO GET THIS.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.403
LOOK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.

00:51.450 --> 00:54.248
WE'RE YOUNG,
WE HAVE BRAS,

00:54.280 --> 00:56.089
AND YOU HAVE
A PROMOTION. OKAY?

00:56.120 --> 00:57.678
ALL RIGHT? WE'RE NOT GOING OUT
TO TRY TO PICK UP GUYS.
(cork pops)

00:57.720 --> 01:00.154
WE'RE GOING OUT
TO TAKE YOU FOR ONE DRINK.
(chants) ONE DRINK...

01:00.190 --> 01:02.158
ONE DRINK.
JUST ONE DRINK,
JUST ONE DRINK.

01:02.190 --> 01:03.327
NO, I CAN'T!

01:03.360 --> 01:05.419
(both chant) YES, YOU CAN!

01:05.460 --> 01:07.621
FINE.
ONE DRINK TO SHUT YOU UP.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.298
(all laugh)
(glasses clink)

01:12.300 --> 01:15.565
* I'VE NEVER FELT THIS WAY
ABOUT SOMEONE, WHOA *

01:15.600 --> 01:17.568
* WHOA *

01:20.310 --> 01:21.834
MAN, LAST NIGHT WAS CRAZY.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.006
YEAH.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.540
THOSE E.T.F. GUYS
SURE KNOW HOW TO PARTY, HUH?

01:24.580 --> 01:25.774
NO DOUBT.

01:25.810 --> 01:27.346
I WISH I'D KNOWN WE WERE
GONNA HAVE PEOPLE OVER.

01:27.380 --> 01:28.938
I WOULD HAVE INVITED
TRACI AND ANDY...

01:28.980 --> 01:30.015
MAYBE EVEN, YOU KNOW, GAIL.

01:30.050 --> 01:31.381
YEAH, ME, TOO.

01:31.420 --> 01:33.217
THING IS, LAST NIGHT WASN'T
REALLY MY IDEA, YOU KNOW?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.511
SUE AND THE E.T.F. GUYS

01:34.560 --> 01:36.721
JUST WANTED TO
TAKE MY MIND OFF THINGS.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.227
OH, OKAY.
WELL, MAYBE NEXT TIME.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.490
MORNING. (sighs) HEY.
HEY.

01:40.530 --> 01:43.169
OH. DON'T DO THAT. I'LL CLEAN UP
AFI'ER I GET BACK FROM SHIFI'.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.292
I GOT IT.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.968
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I GO'I'I'A GO.
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.195
LATER.
BYE.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.458
(sighs)

01:50.510 --> 01:52.307
YOU GONNA GO
TO YOUR APPOINTMENT TODAY?

01:52.340 --> 01:54.069
I DON'T KNOW. I TRIED THERAPY
WHEN MY BROTHER DIED.

01:54.110 --> 01:55.475
TALKING DOESN'T REALLY HELP.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.944
LOOK, IF GOING TO SEE THE SHRINK
GETS YOU BACK ON THE JOB FASTER,

01:57.980 --> 01:59.345
I SAY YOU DO IT...

01:59.380 --> 02:01.871
AND ONCE YOU'RE BACK ON
THE STREET, MAKING A DIFFERENCE,

02:01.920 --> 02:02.887
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

02:02.920 --> 02:03.944
MAYBE.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.259
GONNA SEE YOU AFI'ER WORK?

02:11.290 --> 02:12.996
YEAH.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.225
GO TO THAT APPOINTMENT.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.299
(tires screech)

02:25.340 --> 02:27.979
(Andy)
OHH. THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

02:28.010 --> 02:29.841
NO PROBLEM.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.913
(sighs)

02:32.950 --> 02:34.611
HEY. WE'RE HERE.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.289
(groans)

02:42.390 --> 02:44.255
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU GUYS
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.928
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST CALL IN SICK?

02:45.960 --> 02:49.020
'CAUSE... TRACI'S FIRST DAY.
SHE NEEDS US.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.699
YEAH, AND I NEED A MINT.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.534
HO HO HO. (laughs)
ROUGH NIGHT?

02:57.570 --> 03:01.006
LET'S JUST SAY WE KEPT THE PARTY
GOING IN YOUR HONOR.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.941
LOOKING GOOD, TRACE--
I MEAN, DETECTIVE.

03:03.980 --> 03:07.609
HEY. I'M NOT THERE YET.
HOW'S DOV?

03:07.650 --> 03:09.208
OH, THE SAME.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.514
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.

03:11.550 --> 03:13.609
OH, IT SUCKS THAT
WE CAN'T HELP HIM OUT.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.288
WHY CAN'T WE JUST COME OVER,
COOK SOME FOOD,

03:16.330 --> 03:18.059
AND RENT SOME BATMAN MOVIES?

03:18.090 --> 03:20.354
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK HE WANTS
TO HANG OUT WITH US ANYWAYS.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.459
WHY NOT? WE'RE FUN.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.127
WELL, MAYBE HE JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE TIME TO HIMSELF,

03:24.170 --> 03:25.398
SORT SOME THINGS OUT.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.398
PLEASE. HEY, YOU.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.089
IF YOU EVER CARED
ABOUT ME AT ALL,

03:29.140 --> 03:32.007
YOU'D FIND ME SOME COFFEE.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.371
LET'S GO.

03:33.410 --> 03:34.877
(man) CALL ME,
LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.605
SO?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.140
YOU READY TO DO THIS?

03:38.180 --> 03:40.569
ALREADY HELPED C.I.B.
PROCESS THREE BODIES.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.973
NOW I'M GOING OVER
REPORTS FROM LAST NIGHT,

03:42.020 --> 03:43.817
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I SHOULD CARRY OVER.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.283
WOW, WAY TO WORK IT.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.753
WELL, I JUST DON'T WANT
PEOPLE THINKING

03:46.790 --> 03:49.054
I GOT THIS PROMOTION BECAUSE
I'M SLEEPING WITH JERRY.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.284
NO ONE'S GONNA THINK THAT.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.683
I WOULD.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.899
YOU GOTTA SHAKE OFF
THAT NEGATIVITY.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.228
OKAY? COME OUT OF
THE GATE RUNNING.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.760
YOU ARE TRACI NASH,

03:58.800 --> 04:00.836
AND YOU ARE HERE
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE TO BE HERE,

04:00.870 --> 04:02.406
AND THAT'S
WHAT EVERYBODY'S GONNA KNOW.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.702
OKAY.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.264
THAT'S A GOOD PEP TALK,
COACH.

04:05.310 --> 04:06.277
MM-HMM.
GOT YOUR BACK, TRACI.

04:06.310 --> 04:07.277
ALL RIGHT.

04:07.310 --> 04:09.005
ALL RIGHT. GO BREAK A LEG.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.600
(chuckles)

04:11.650 --> 04:14.619
(indistinct conversations)

04:14.650 --> 04:17.118
(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

04:17.150 --> 04:18.686
DID YOU HAVE A NICE TIME
WITH THE GIRLS LAST NIGHT?

04:18.720 --> 04:20.187
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR YOU.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.552
YOU KNOW, IT'S A SCIENTIFIC FACT
THAT THE OXYGEN ABOVE A BAR TOP

04:22.590 --> 04:25.252
IS THE THINNEST, SO IT'S
NO WONDER YOUR HEAD HURTS.

04:25.290 --> 04:26.996
***

04:27.030 --> 04:29.396
(hums)

04:29.430 --> 04:31.022
I GOT YOUR TEXTS.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.025
OH, MY GOD.

04:32.070 --> 04:33.059
NOW THE REALLY GOOD STUFF--

04:33.100 --> 04:34.897
THAT STARTED COMING
AROUND 2:00 OR 3:00.

04:34.940 --> 04:38.159
NO. YOU... YOU HAVE TO E--
NICK, YOU HAVE TO ERASE THOSE.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.337
ERASE THE EVIDENCE THAT THE FUN,
CAREFREE GAIL I ONCE KNEW

04:40.380 --> 04:42.974
STILL EXISTS? NOT A CHANCE.

04:43.010 --> 04:46.275
(telephones ringing)

04:46.320 --> 04:48.345
NICK, I'M ACTUALLY NOT JOKING.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.746
OKAY, LET'S HAVE A ROUND
OF APPLAUSE FOR NASH,

04:50.790 --> 04:54.487
WHO WILL BE STARTING HER 6-MONTH
ROTATION WITH THE D's TODAY.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.626
(cheering)
NOW I FINALLY GET WHAT YOU SAW
IN JERRY. (chuckles)

04:57.660 --> 04:58.922
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S SUNDAY MORNING.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.825
LOTS OF PEOPLE MOVING
IN AND OUT OF THE CITY,

05:00.860 --> 05:02.691
SO LET'S KEEP THE ROADS MOVING,

05:02.730 --> 05:04.721
AND WE'LL HAVE
A NICE, QUIET MORNING.

05:04.770 --> 05:05.725
(murmuring)

05:05.770 --> 05:07.397
CAR ASSIGNMENTS
ARE ON THE BOARD.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.159
I, OF COURSE, WILL BE...
ON DESK DUTY.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.404
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
WILLIAMS?

05:11.440 --> 05:13.305
CAN'T CUT IT ON THE STREET
ANYMORE? (chuckles)

05:13.340 --> 05:16.673
ALL RIGHT. OKAY. LET'S GO. GO.
(laughter)

05:19.280 --> 05:21.510
(indistinct conversations)

05:21.550 --> 05:23.643
(Noelle) NASH.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE JERRY IS?

05:23.690 --> 05:26.716
HEADQUARTERS BEEN CALLING HIM,
VOICE MAIL... WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.216
HE GOT A NEW SMARTPHONE.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.682
HE CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW IT WORKS.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.392
(laughs)
WHY ARE YOU WEARING A SWEATER?

05:32.430 --> 05:33.852
IT'S, LIKE,
A MILLION DEGREES IN HERE.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.222
YEAH, WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO PICK
UP THE CASE FILE FOR HIM, THEN.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.521
SO MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT

05:38.570 --> 05:40.788
IS PICKING UP
DETECTIVE BARBER'S PAPERWORK?

05:40.840 --> 05:43.206
YEAH, YOU MAKE YOUR BED,
YOU LIE IN IT...

05:43.240 --> 05:47.233
EVEN IF YOUR BED IS A DESK,
AND YOU HATE IT.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.271
JUST THINK OF IT
AS A DISPLAY OF GRATITUDE

05:49.310 --> 05:51.847
FOR JERRY
GETTING YOU THIS GIG.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.124
EPSTEIN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:05.160 --> 06:06.991
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

06:07.030 --> 06:08.918
I MEAN, I'LL--I'LL DO ANYTHING--
I'LL WASH SQUAD CARS,

06:08.960 --> 06:10.325
I'LL INVENTORY
THE EVIDENCE ROOM...

06:10.370 --> 06:12.861
I CAN'T BRING YOU BACK UNTIL
THE POLICE SHRINK CLEARS YOU,

06:12.900 --> 06:14.697
AND DR. MANSFIELD
WON'T CLEAR YOU

06:14.740 --> 06:16.765
UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY GO
TO YOUR APPOINTMENTS.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.301
I WENT... ONCE. IT WAS STUPID.
WE BOTH JUST SAT THERE.

06:19.340 --> 06:23.800
I DON'T NEED A SHRINK.
I GOTTA GET BACK ON THE JOB.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.909
NOT TILL YOU'RE CLEARED.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.918
YOU NEED TO DEAL
WITH WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.110
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
KID HAD A GUN.

06:29.150 --> 06:31.289
HE FIRED IT AT ME.
I SHOT HIM.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.915
SORRY, EPSTEIN.
MY HANDS ARE TIED.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.952
(chewing)

06:49.940 --> 06:50.907
(door opens)

06:50.940 --> 06:52.032
(Oliver) HEY.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.571
HEY. HOW'S IT GOING?

06:53.610 --> 06:55.032
ARE YOU LEAVING
WITHOUT SAYING "HI"

06:55.080 --> 06:56.206
TO YOUR FAVORITE
TRAINING OFFICER?

06:56.240 --> 06:57.502
NOELLE'S BUSY, SO--

06:57.550 --> 07:00.144
NICE. EPSTEIN, YOU HAVEN'T
LOST YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.374
HAVE A GOOD SHIFT.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.615
OH, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.186
COME HERE.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.312
HOW ARE YOU?

07:06.350 --> 07:07.510
GOOD.

07:09.990 --> 07:11.924
OKAY, QUESTION--

07:11.960 --> 07:14.451
WHEN YOU GOT SHOT
AND YOU WERE OFF THE JOB,

07:14.500 --> 07:15.728
WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.039
I, UH... I-I HELPED OUT WITH
IZZY AND MADDIE'S SOCCER TEAMS,

07:21.070 --> 07:23.937
WHICH MOSTLY MEANT THAT I-
I BROUGHT THE SLICED ORANGES

07:23.970 --> 07:25.801
AND I, UH,
I CHEERED MY HEAD OFF.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.137
KIND OF REMINDED ME

07:27.180 --> 07:29.478
THAT I'M NOT JUST A UNIFORM
AND A GUN AND A BADGE,

07:29.510 --> 07:32.479
THAT I CAN HELP
WITHOUT CHASING BAD GUYS.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.215
YOU'RE A GOOD DAD.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.115
YOUR GIRLS
ARE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

07:36.150 --> 07:38.744
(door opens)

07:38.790 --> 07:40.849
(door closes)

07:40.890 --> 07:42.482
(beeps)

07:42.530 --> 07:44.828
GOOD MORNING, MCNALLY.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.623
YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING.

07:46.660 --> 07:49.493
NASH'S FIRST DAY, AND YOU'RE
GOING OUT THERE HUNGOVER.

07:49.530 --> 07:50.997
NICE WORK. REAL ROOKIE MOVE.

07:51.030 --> 07:52.497
OKAY, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS JOB
FOR TWO YEARS NOW,

07:52.540 --> 07:56.032
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING,
AND I'M NOT HUNGOVER.

07:56.070 --> 07:57.435
YOU GOT SPARKLES
IN YOUR HAIR.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.700
DO NOT. (whispers) STOP.

07:59.740 --> 08:00.968
(normal voice) YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD HAVE COME WITH US.

08:01.010 --> 08:03.069
I HAD YOUR SKINNY JEANS
AND BANDANNA ALL PICKED OUT.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.499
NOT EVEN IF YOU MAKE CHIEF.
ALL RIGHT. LET ME DO THAT.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.279
CAN I DO IT NOW?
LET ME DO IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.618
YOU JUST--YOU JUST CAN'T
TURN IT OFF, CAN YOU?

08:09.650 --> 08:11.686
YOU NEED TO TURN IT ON
TO GET THE COFFEE TO COME OUT.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.755
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE MACHINE.

08:12.790 --> 08:13.916
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.086
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY
A TRAINING OFFICER.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.417
YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.121
ARE YOU CALLING ME
A CONTROL FREAK?

08:18.160 --> 08:19.627
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
LET A ROOKIE DRIVE,

08:19.660 --> 08:21.252
WHILE YOU'VE BEEN
A TRAINING OFFICER?

08:23.330 --> 08:24.297
FREAK.

08:24.330 --> 08:25.524
(beeps)

08:25.570 --> 08:27.538
COME ON. YOU GOTTA LET US
FUMBLE AROUND, YOU KNOW,

08:27.570 --> 08:29.629
FIGURE IT OUT FOR OURSELVES.
THAT'S HOW WE LEARN.

08:29.670 --> 08:30.864

10:46.570 --> 10:48.276

10:53.220 --> 10:54.175

ON THE WAY OVER.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.642
DO WE KNOW
WHO WAS DRIVING?

10:55.680 --> 10:57.739
WELL, DETECTIVE, TH ESE THREE
ARE PLAYING "I AM SPARTACUS."

10:57.790 --> 10:59.417
EACH ONE OF THEM SAY
THAT THEY WERE DRIVING,

10:59.450 --> 11:01.008
SO WE CAN'T ARREST

11:01.060 --> 11:03.119
WHERE'S THE BODY?

11:03.160 --> 11:04.650

11:41.130 --> 11:43.724
OKAY, IT LOOKS LIKE THE VICTIM

11:43.770 --> 11:46.022
A LARGE LACERATION
IN HIS FOREHEAD...

11:46.070 --> 11:49.733
CONSISTENT WITH BLOOD SPATTER
ON THE WINDSHIELD. NO SEAT BELT.

11:49.770 --> 11:52.307
THERE'S NO 5--

11:55.240 --> 11:59.347
LOOKS LIKE HE, UH, HIT HIS HEAD,
PROBABLY DIED INSTANTLY.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.847
SO WHAT'S THE CHARGE?

12:00.880 --> 12:03.917
IMPAIRED OPERATION
CAUSING DEATH.

12:03.950 --> 12:05.349
THAT'S IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT

12:05.390 --> 12:06.709
WHO WAS DRIVING
THE CAR THAT HIT HIM.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.784

12:16.000 --> 12:18.161

12:18.200 --> 12:20.191
OKAY, WELL, YOU WANT TO
TELL THAT TO THIS GUY?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.209
OKAY, WELL, THE WHOLE REGION
IS AT A STANDSTILL

12:23.240 --> 12:25.504
BECAUSE OF THIS ONE CAR.
CAN'T YOU JUST MOVE IT?

12:25.540 --> 12:28.077

12:28.110 --> 12:30.874

MAKING THE CALL, GO FOR IT.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.180
TEN MINUTES. GIVE 'EM
TEN MORE MINUTES, PLEASE.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.625
(dog barking in distance)

13:17.160 --> 13:19.890
27 TRAINS ARE
AT A STANDSTILL!

13:19.930 --> 13:24.720
THEY'RE BLOCKING MAJOR ARTERIES
ALL ACROSS THE G.T.A.!

13:24.770 --> 13:26.499
WHAT'S UP, TRACE?

13:26.530 --> 13:29.067
WELL, TRAFFIC RECON TEAM
IS DONE, AND...

13:29.100 --> 13:31.307
I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE
I.D.E.N.T. HAS WHAT THEY NEED.

13:31.340 --> 13:32.739
LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST
A MATTER OF--OF TRAFFIC.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.579
IT'S A MATTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

13:34.610 --> 13:38.478

STALLED ON ITS WAY TO A CALL B--
ENOUGH! WE GET IT.

13:38.510 --> 13:41.274
OKAY. NASH.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.219
(grunts)

13:59.270 --> 14:01.363
(sighs)

14:03.310 --> 14:05.266
THE GIRL WITH THE GREEN DRESS
WAS IN THE BACK.

14:05.310 --> 14:08.336
THE LADY WITH THAT "BRIDE" THING
ACROSS HER CHEST--

14:08.380 --> 14:10.644
SHE WAS DRIVING. I SAW HER
GET OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.217
SO THE BRIDE WAS DRIVING.
YOU SURE?

14:13.250 --> 14:15.115
'COURSE I'M SURE.
I'M AN IRONMAN.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.482
I'M IN PEAK MENTAL

HAS COME TO AN END.
WE HAVE AN EYEWITNESS. GET UP.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.663
ANGELA KEHOE...

14:30.700 --> 14:33.567

OPERATION CAUSING DEATH.
(handcuffs cllcklng)

14:33.600 --> 14:35.465
"DEATH"?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:35.500 --> 14:36.728
"WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT"?

14:36.770 --> 14:38.704
THERE'S A DEAD MAN IN THAT
"PARKED CAR" THAT YOU HIT.

14:38.740 --> 14:39.900
THE CAR WASN'T EVEN--

14:39.940 --> 14:41.032

14:48.180 --> 14:49.215
OH, THOSE ARE
YOUR PARTING GIl-TS

14:49.250 --> 14:51.115

BOTH OF THEM.

14:51.150 --> 14:52.515
ALL RIGHT, WELL, GET EVERYONE
BACK TO THE STATION,

14:52.550 --> 14:55.212
AND GIVE THE DRIVER
A BREATHALYZER TEST.

14:55.260 --> 14:58.081
(man) YOU ARE NEEDED HERE,
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.882
ROOKIE'S ALL GROWED UP.

14:59.930 --> 15:01.727

15:10.970 --> 15:12.938
(ringtone continues)

15:12.980 --> 15:15.505
(siren wailing in distance,
horn honks)

15:15.540 --> 15:17.770
(knocks on roof)

15:17.810 --> 15:19.675
YOU'RE THE COP
WHO SHOT MY BROTHER.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.745
WE DON'T NEED YOUR CHARITY.

15:22.780 --> 15:23.883
I JUST WANTED TO--

15:23.920 --> 15:24.989
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WANT.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.442
OKAY. LOOK, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY--

15:26.490 --> 15:27.559
YOU DON'T GET TO USE THIS
TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER.

15:27.590 --> 15:29.512
OKAY, THEN PLEASE JUST
TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.256
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
JUST... PLEASE.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.790
FINE.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.525
I NEED A RIDE.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.434
(whirring)

15:42.470 --> 15:43.539
MAKE SURE THAT'S WHEN WE...

15:43.570 --> 15:46.767
WHO SAID
THIS CAR CIJLIJ'IB BE MOVED?

15:46.810 --> 15:48.971
BUT I CHECKED WITH I.D.E.N.T.
I CHECKED WITH TRAFFIC RECON.

15:49.010 --> 15:51.376
THEY ALL GOT WHAT THEY NEEDED
BEFORE THE CAR WAS MOVED.

15:51.410 --> 15:52.809
WHAT ABOUT THE CORONER?

15:52.850 --> 15:54.909
OR DID YOU GET YOUR MEDICAL
DEGREE WHILE I WASN'T LOOKING?

15:54.950 --> 15:55.917
(whirring stops)

15:55.950 --> 15:58.180
NO, OF COURSE NOT, BUT I--

15:58.220 --> 16:00.586
FRANK. FRANK.
I ORDERED NASH TO MOVE THE CAR.

16:00.620 --> 16:01.587
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

16:01.620 --> 16:02.757
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
ALL MORNING.

16:02.790 --> 16:05.258
IT'S MY NEW PHONE.
UH, I DON'T--

16:05.290 --> 16:06.996
WELL, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT IT IS.

16:07.030 --> 16:09.294
IT'S JUST IT'S NOT, UH,
IT'S NOT RECEIVING CALLS.

16:09.330 --> 16:11.992
THIS CASE BETTER BE
AS SOLID AS YOU THINK IT IS,

16:12.030 --> 16:16.034
OR HEADS WILL ROLL--
YOUR HEAD, DETECTIVE BARBER.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.734
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.203
NO, Y-Y-YEAH, I DID.
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.603
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.901
(man) DETECTIVE BARBER.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.183
HOW'S IT GOING, TEDD?

16:31.220 --> 16:33.654
I'M JUST PEACHY, JERRY.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

16:33.690 --> 16:37.421
YOU TWO, HOWEVER--
YOU'VE HAD BETTER DAYS.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.223
REALLY? WHY'S THAT?

16:39.260 --> 16:41.421
MM. SEE THIS?

16:41.460 --> 16:42.950
HAVE A LOOK.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.968
INTERCOSTAL LACERATION.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.126
KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A KNIFE WOUND.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.194
YEAH, IT DOES.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.299
MM, YEAH, I CAN'T
BE CERTAIN, BUT, UH,

16:49.340 --> 16:50.739
I'D BET

16:50.770 --> 16:51.998
HE WAS STABBED?

16:52.040 --> 16:55.134
YEAH, AND LONG DEAD
BY THE TIME THOSE WOMEN HIT HIM.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.375
SO I COMPROMISED
THE SCENE OF A HOMICIDE?

16:59.410 --> 17:03.414
YEAH. LIKE I SAID,
YOU'VE HAD BETTER DAYS.

17:03.450 --> 17:07.216
(sighing)

17:10.360 --> 17:11.452
(Jerry) NO.

17:11.490 --> 17:12.457
(Traci) COME ON.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.718
TRACI, YOU NEED TO STAY

17:13.760 --> 17:15.796
AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS
INVESTIGATION AS POSSIBLE.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.297
THIS IS MY MESS.
I NEED TO FIX IT.

17:17.330 --> 17:18.399
NO, I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU

17:18.430 --> 17:19.920
GET YANKED OFF
YOUR DETECTIVE ROTATION

17:19.970 --> 17:21.790
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON TOP OF.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.637
HEY, THE VICTIM'S
NAMED JESSE SALENKO,

17:39.790 --> 17:41.052
I'M GONNA TALK
TO THE DRUG SQUAD

17:41.090 --> 17:42.955
AND SEE IF THEY GOT ANY MORE
INFORMATION ON OUR VICTIM.

17:42.990 --> 17:43.957
(Traci) JERRY.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.287
(Jerry) NO.

17:46.330 --> 17:49.049
IF SHE KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD
FOR HER, SHE'LL BACK OFF.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.499
IT WAS JUST
A ROOKIE MISTAKE.

17:50.530 --> 17:53.533
YEAH,
AND I LET HER MAKE IT.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.562

18:17.160 --> 18:18.718
Yeah? Who's this?

18:18.760 --> 18:20.955
UH, THIS IS
OFFICER SAM SWAREK.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.695
CAN MY PARTNER AND I
COME UP

18:22.730 --> 18:25.369
AND TALK TO YOU
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.799
Yeah, sure.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.593
(buzzer)

18:28.640 --> 18:30.528
(door opens)

18:33.510 --> 18:35.205
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
THIS PART OF THE JOB.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.243
(police radio chatter)

18:39.250 --> 18:40.717
PAUL SALENKO?

18:40.750 --> 18:41.842
YEAH.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.381
CAN WE STEP INSIDE
FOR A MINUTE?

18:43.420 --> 18:45.012
WHY? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

18:45.050 --> 18:46.915
SIR, PLEASE?

18:55.460 --> 18:57.997
SO IS THIS ABOUT MY BROTHER?

18:58.030 --> 18:59.793
MR. SALENKO, I'M VERY SORRY
TO TELL YOU THIS,

18:59.830 --> 19:01.161
BUT YOUR BROTHER IS DEAD.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.328
W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED TO JESSE?

19:04.370 --> 19:05.928
WE'VE JUST STARTED
THE INVESTIGATION,

19:05.970 --> 19:08.131
AND WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
AS SOON AS WE CAN, OKAY?

19:08.180 --> 19:11.570
DID SOMEONE HURT HIM?
PLEASE JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.702
IT LOOKS THAT WAY, YEAH.

19:12.750 --> 19:13.842
(whispers) OH, JEEZ.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.768
HEY. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
I GOT YOU.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.344
I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.812
HEY, JUST BREATHE IN
THROUGH YOUR MOUTH,

19:18.850 --> 19:21.557
OUT THROUGH YOUR NOSE. OKAY?
THAT'LL HELP WITH YOUR STOMACH.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.888
(pants)

19:25.890 --> 19:28.597
(police radio chatter)

19:28.630 --> 19:30.689
(camera shutter clicks)
PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO LET HER GO.

19:30.730 --> 19:32.595
HER WEDDING IS IN,
LIKE, FOUR HOURS.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.995
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

19:34.040 --> 19:35.530
BEFORE YOU WENT OUT
AND GOT HAMMERED.

19:35.570 --> 19:37.094
IT WAS HER BRILLIANT IDEA.

19:37.140 --> 19:39.506
YEAH, AND IF WE
HAD IT YOUR WAY,

19:39.540 --> 19:42.008
WE WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE BALLET
AND BEEN IN BED BY 10:00.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.372
YES, AND BEEN PROPERLY
RESTED FOR THE WEDDING.

19:44.410 --> 19:45.946
OH, AND ALSO? NOT IN JAIL.
IS IT WEIRD

19:45.980 --> 19:48.448
THAT I FIND THE SOUND
OF THEIR BICKERING COMFORTING?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.643
LIKE WAVES LAPPING
AGAINST THE SHORE.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.715
SOUNDS LIKE DINNER
AT YOUR MA'S HOUSE.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.909
I'D LIKE TO CALL
MY BROTHER COLE.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.178
HE'S THE GROOM
AND A LAWYER.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.028
OOH. OKAY.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.958
HERE YOU GO.

20:09.170 --> 20:11.206
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

20:11.240 --> 20:15.279
UH, CLUB 191,
THE AFTER-HOURS BAR WE WERE AT.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.642
(papers rustle)

20:36.260 --> 20:38.069
(sighs)

20:38.100 --> 20:39.795
WHERE ARE WE HEADED?

20:39.830 --> 20:41.468
JUST DRIVE.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.536
I'M--I'M--I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOU
ANYWHERE YOU NEED TO GO.

20:43.570 --> 20:44.832
I JUST--I HAVE AN APPOINT--

20:44.870 --> 20:46.030
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED

20:46.070 --> 20:47.901
THE DAY
YOU KILLED MY BROTHER,

20:47.940 --> 20:50.875
AND IT'LL BE EASIER
IF YOU DRIVE WHILE WE TALK.

20:50.910 --> 20:53.447
THAT WAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO
LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

20:58.150 --> 20:59.879
THE BRIDAL PARTY

20:59.920 --> 21:02.684
WAS AT THE EXACT SAME
AFTER-HOURS CLUB AS THE VICTIM.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.529
OKAY, DIDN'T JERRY
TELL YOU TO BACK OFF?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.881
NEW PLAN--WE KEEP THE GIRLS
HERE A LITTLE LONGER,

21:06.930 --> 21:09.194
AND THEN WE INTERVIEW THEM
AS POTENTIAL WITNESSES.

21:09.230 --> 21:11.528
THEY REMEMBER JESSE SALENKO
FROM THE CLUB, THEN MAYBE

21:11.570 --> 21:12.889
THEY'LL REMEMBER SOMETHING
TO HELP US CATCH HIS KILLER.

21:12.930 --> 21:15.069
UM, SHOULDN'T WE JUST
TAKE THIS ONE ON THE CHIN

21:15.100 --> 21:16.590
AND, YOU KNOW,
CATCH 'EM NEXT TIME?

21:16.640 --> 21:18.267
NO, BECAUSE
HALF THE DIVISION THINKS

21:18.310 --> 21:20.505
I ONLY GOT THIS PROMOTION
'CAUSE I'M SLEEPING WITH JERRY.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.871
YEAH, AND I GOT HER
INTO THIS MESS

21:21.910 --> 21:23.446
BECAUSE I WENT ALL
TONY ROBBINS ON HER.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.142
WAIT, YOU WANT US TO GET FIRED
SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PROMOTION?

21:26.180 --> 21:28.273
GAIL, I HAVE WORKED HARDER THAN
YOU HAVE IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

21:28.320 --> 21:30.174
TO GET HERE, SO YOU'RE
GONNA HELP ME STAY HERE.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.688
THAT'S NOT A REQUEST.
YES, MA'AM.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.780
WHERE DO YOU WANT US TO GO?
ANDY AND I TAKE THE BRIDE.
YOU TWO TAKE THE HARPIES.

21:35.820 --> 21:36.787
OKAY.

21:36.820 --> 21:37.821
OKAY.

21:39.130 --> 21:42.850
I NEEDED SOME FRESH AIR,
SO I WENT OUT BACK.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.629
THERE WAS A GUY OUT THERE,
HE TOLD ME HIS NAME WAS JESSE

21:44.670 --> 21:46.126
AND ASKED ME
IF I WANTED TO PARTY,

21:46.170 --> 21:48.229
I SAID "NO"
AND I WENT BACK INSIDE.

21:48.270 --> 21:50.295
WAS THAT THE ONLY CONTACT
YOU HAD WITH THE VICTIM?

21:50.340 --> 21:51.568
YES.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.699
(door opens)

21:55.740 --> 21:57.344
(door closes)

21:57.380 --> 21:59.905
DID JESSE SEEM
AGITATED OR SCARED

21:59.950 --> 22:01.577
LIKE SOMEONE WAS AI-TER HIM?

22:01.620 --> 22:03.019
NO.

22:03.050 --> 22:04.881
HE WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.911
HE KEPT BUYING
ANGIE AND ME DRINKS.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.588
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

22:08.620 --> 22:09.814
(scoffs) BROOKE WAS
TOO MUCH OF A SNOB

22:09.860 --> 22:11.327
TO EVEN GIVE HIM
THE TIME OF DAY.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.952
WELL, NOW THAT WE KNOW
HE WAS A DRUG DEALER,

22:12.990 --> 22:14.594
I'D SAY MY JUDGMENT
IS PRETTY GOOD.

22:14.630 --> 22:16.154
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR JUDGMENT.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.067
CONGRATULATIONS
ON BEING A WHORE.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.533
HEY!

22:20.570 --> 22:23.698
THAT'S ENOUGH. STOP!
GO TO YOUR CORNER.
(Gall) HEY!

22:23.740 --> 22:25.105
WHAT'S THAT
ON YOUR SHOULDER?

22:25.140 --> 22:27.233
LOOKS LIKE A SEAT BELT BURN,
OFFICER DIAZ.

22:27.270 --> 22:28.532
CONSISTENT WITH SOMEONE
WHO WAS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT

22:28.580 --> 22:30.207
WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.674
SO OUR IRONMAN WAS WRONG.

22:32.710 --> 22:35.349
WELL, HE SAID HE READ "BRIDE"
ON THE DRIVER'S SASH.

22:35.380 --> 22:37.484
MAYBE HE STOPPED READING BEFORE
HE GOT TO THE "MAID" PART.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.147
(Chris pants)

22:39.190 --> 22:40.919
I THINK YOU'D BETTER CALL
THAT LAWYER. COME ON. LET'S GO.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.984
(chair clatters)

22:42.020 --> 22:43.385
(Chris) COME ON.
(door opens, beeps)

22:43.430 --> 22:46.081
HEY. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
(door closes)

22:46.130 --> 22:47.722
YOU TAKE YOUR BEST GIRLFRIEND
CLUBBING

22:47.760 --> 22:48.897
THE NIGHT BEFORE HER WEDDING,

22:48.930 --> 22:50.921
YOU LET HER GET IN A CAR
WITH A DRUNK DRIVER,

22:50.970 --> 22:52.119
AND THEN YOU LET HER
TAKE THE RAP

22:52.170 --> 22:53.967
FOR A CRIME
THAT SHE DIDN'T EVEN COMMIT.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.297
THAT'S NICE WORK.

22:55.340 --> 22:58.104
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
GETTING IN THE CAR.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.233
I WAS COMPLETELY
OUT OF IT BY THEN.

23:00.270 --> 23:02.977
I DON'T THINK YOU GET HOW THIS
WHOLE MAID OF HONOR THING WORKS.

23:03.010 --> 23:04.602
I MEAN, THE BRIDE
IS SUPPOSED TO GET WASTED

23:04.650 --> 23:05.947
WHILE YOU LOOK AFTER HER.

23:05.980 --> 23:08.244
I WANTED TO TALK
TO ANGIE LAST NIGHT,

23:08.280 --> 23:10.441
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE NERVE,

23:10.490 --> 23:13.914
SO I DRANK... A LOT.

23:14.860 --> 23:18.227
LET ME GUESS.
YOU SLEPT WITH HER FIANCE?

23:18.260 --> 23:20.353
(sighs)

23:20.390 --> 23:24.167
I THINK SHE'S MAKING A MISTAKE,
MARRYING COLE.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.862
I WANTED TO TELL HER THAT
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE,

23:26.900 --> 23:28.868
BUT THEN SHE TOOK OFF
WITH THAT JESSE GUY.

23:28.900 --> 23:32.028
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE SOMEONE
WHO SHOULD BE GETTING MARRIED?

23:36.280 --> 23:38.202
YOUR MAID OF HONOR
JUST TOLD MY COLLEAGUE

23:38.250 --> 23:39.945
SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING.
SHE SAID THAT

23:39.980 --> 23:42.414
YOU WERE WITH THE VICTIM
FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT.
(door closes)

23:42.450 --> 23:44.281
I DON'T KNOW
WHY SHE'D SAY THAT.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.208
ANGELA.

23:47.290 --> 23:49.485
OKAY, YES, WE TALKED.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.485
WE DID A RAIL TOGETHER...

23:52.530 --> 23:55.158
AND THEN THIS OTHER GUY
SHOWED UP, TOTALLY FREAKED OUT,

23:55.200 --> 23:56.792
AND SAID HE NEEDED
TO TALK TO JESSE.

23:56.830 --> 23:58.320
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

23:58.370 --> 23:59.860
I DON'T KNOW--HE DRAGGED JESSE
OFF TOWARDS THE PARKING LOT,

23:59.900 --> 24:01.595
AND THAT WAS THE LAST
THAT I SAW OF EITHER OF THEM.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.039
WELL, DID YOU CATCH
THE OTHER GUY'S NAME?

24:03.070 --> 24:05.004
I ASSUMED
IT WAS JESSE'S BROTHER

24:05.040 --> 24:07.406
BECAUSE JESSE KEPT
CALLING HIM "LITTLE BRO."

24:07.440 --> 24:10.603
LIKE, "RELAX, LITTLE BRO."
"I'LL DEAL WITH IT, LITTLE BRO."

24:18.590 --> 24:20.581
IS A MATCH FOR THE VICTIM'S
LITTLE BROTHER, BRING HIM IN.

24:20.620 --> 24:23.953
MM-HMM. FEEL LIKE SOLVING
A MURDER ON YOUR FIRST SHII-T?

24:23.990 --> 24:25.821
***

24:28.760 --> 24:29.852
ALL RIGHT.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.026
WELL, WE'LL SIT
ON PAUL SALENKO

24:31.070 --> 24:34.039
UNTIL YOU SEND
THE COMPOSITE SKETCH.

24:34.070 --> 24:35.492
THAN KS.

24:35.540 --> 24:38.862
WE GOT A POSSIBLE SUSPECT
FOR OUR HOMICIDE, AND...

24:38.910 --> 24:42.004
IT'S THE VICTIM'S BROTHER.
IMAGINE THAT.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.234
GUY WAS SO BROKEN UP,

24:43.280 --> 24:44.542
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED
HE WAS INVOLVED.

24:44.580 --> 24:46.741
YEAH, WELL,
YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

24:46.780 --> 24:49.340
(police radio chatter)

24:49.380 --> 24:52.679
(clears throat) OKAY,
SO THEORIES—-WHAT DO YOU GOT?

24:52.720 --> 24:56.383
UH, WELL, USUAL MOTIVES
ARE LOVE AND MONEY, SO...

24:56.420 --> 24:58.081
MAYBE PAUL KILLED HIS BROTHER

24:58.130 --> 24:59.586
'CAUSE THEY WERE IN LOVE
WITH THE SAME GIRL.

24:59.630 --> 25:02.098
RIGHT, WELL,
OUR VICTIM'S GOT A RAP SHEET

25:02.130 --> 25:04.098
FOR COCAINE POSSESSION
AND TRAFFICKING.

25:04.130 --> 25:06.690
OKAY. OKAY.
SO HE WAS AN ENTREPRENEUR.

25:06.730 --> 25:09.460
MAYBE HIS LITTLE BROTHER
WANTED IN ON THE BUSINESS.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.309
THINK THAT'S BETTER.

25:11.340 --> 25:14.332
(siren wailing)

25:16.980 --> 25:19.778
TELL ME AGAIN
FROM THE BEGINNING.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.914
YEAH, I...
H ALREADY TOLD YOU I--

25:21.950 --> 25:25.317
NOT THE VERSION I READ
IN THE POLICE REPORT. THE TRUTH.

25:27.350 --> 25:29.159
YOUR BROTHER WAS
BEHIND THE COUNTER.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.681
I THOUGHT HE WORKED THERE,
BUT SOMETHING WAS OFF.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.789
I ASKED HIM TO STEP OUT
BEHIND THE COUNTER

25:33.830 --> 25:35.593
AND SHOW ME HIS HANDS, BUT...

25:35.630 --> 25:39.225
HE DIDN'T. HE DUCKED,
AND WHEN HE STOOD BACK UP...

25:39.270 --> 25:41.431
HE HAD A GUN.

25:41.470 --> 25:45.065
WHY DID YOU GO
INTO THE STORE?

25:45.110 --> 25:46.964
I NEEDED LICORICE.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.499
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID,
BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.676
DID HE DIE RIGHT AWAY?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.312
WHAT?

25:57.350 --> 25:59.443
WHEN THE BULLET FROM YOUR GUN
PUT A HOLE

25:59.490 --> 26:01.811
IN MY BROTHER'S CHEST,
DID HE DIE RIGHT AWAY?

26:11.370 --> 26:13.258
(sighs)

26:14.640 --> 26:17.803
YOUR BROTHER WAS BLEEDING OUT,
BUT HE WAS STILL BREATHING.

26:17.840 --> 26:22.800
I TRIED TO KEEP HIM ALIVE
UNTIL THE MEDICS GOT THERE.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.047
HOW HARD DID YOU TRY?

26:26.610 --> 26:28.919
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

26:28.950 --> 26:31.748
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME WHAT I WANT
TO KNOW. THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.212
YOUR BROTHER HAD A GUN.
HE SHOT AT ME.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.081
I HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO SHOOT HIM.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.418
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MY BROTHER.

26:37.460 --> 26:40.179
I KNOW I WAS HAVING A PERFECT LY
GOOD LIFE UNTIL HE CAME ALONG.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.892
ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS SHOW ME HIS HANDS.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.589
I'M SORRY.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.608
(seat belt clicks)

26:58.410 --> 26:59.741
(hangs up receiver)

26:59.780 --> 27:01.668
FIRST THE BRIDE WAS DRIVING.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.369
NOW THE BRIDESMAID'S DRIVING.

27:03.420 --> 27:06.389
NEXT, IT'LL BE THE BRIDE'S
THIRD COUSIN WITH THE WONKY EYE.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.718
HEY, YOU BEEN GETTING ANY PHOTOS
BY ACCIDENT FROM JERRY?

27:08.760 --> 27:11.649
HE'S BEEN SENDING 'EM TO ALL OF
US SINCE HE GOT THAT NEW PHONE.

27:11.690 --> 27:15.296
LAST WEEK, HE SENT ME ONE
WHERE HE'S IN SHORTS.

27:15.330 --> 27:16.592
IT WAS AWKWARD.

27:16.630 --> 27:21.067
CHRIS, WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER,
WAS I INCONSISTENT?

27:21.100 --> 27:22.692
W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:22.740 --> 27:25.903
HOT ONE MINUTE,
THEN COLD THE NEXT?

27:25.940 --> 27:28.477
UH, YEAH, YOU KNOW?

27:28.510 --> 27:31.149
A LITTLE, MAYBE, BUT HEY,
THAT WAS HALF THE FUN

27:31.180 --> 27:33.740
OF DATING YOU, YOU KNOW?
ALWAYS KEPT ME ON MY TOES.

27:33.780 --> 27:34.940
(telephone rings)

27:35.520 --> 27:37.818
I THINK I'M A SOCIOPATH.

27:37.850 --> 27:39.408
GAIL,
YOU'RE NOT A SOCIOPATH.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.554
WELL, THEN WHY CAN'T I
EXPRESS MYSELF

27:41.590 --> 27:44.650
IN A WAY THAT IS NOT DRIPPING
WITH SARCASM OR CONTEMPT

27:44.690 --> 27:47.579
UNLESS I'M DRUNK, APPARENTLY?

27:47.630 --> 27:49.552
OKAY, YOU GOT A HARD SHELL,

27:49.600 --> 27:51.818
BUT YOU KNOW,
ONCE YOU CRACK IT--

27:51.870 --> 27:53.895
DON'T SAY "OOEY GOOEY CENTER."
THAT'S REALLY GROSS.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.532
IT'S NOT A BAD QUALITY.

27:55.570 --> 27:56.889
IT'S JUST WHO YOU ARE,

27:56.940 --> 28:00.706
AND IT WAS WORTH IT
TO BE WITH YOU.

28:00.740 --> 28:02.139
YOU ARE SUCH A SAP.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.741
THANK YOU.

28:14.090 --> 28:15.409
(cell phone alert chimes, beep)

28:15.460 --> 28:19.351
MCNALLY SENT THE POLICE SKETCH.
IT'S PAUL SALENKO.

28:19.390 --> 28:20.550
YEP. HE FOOLED US ONCE.

28:20.590 --> 28:23.024
THIS TIME, WE'RE BRINGING HIM IN
NO MATTER WHAT.

28:28.870 --> 28:31.259
POLICE!

28:36.710 --> 28:38.075
CLEARING UPSTAIRS.

28:38.110 --> 28:39.907
COPY THAT.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.410
POLICE!

28:43.420 --> 28:44.887
(police radio chatter)

28:44.920 --> 28:47.912
(Paul) I DIDN'T TAKE IT.
I DON'T HAVE IT! OKAY, OKAY.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.782
SWAREK! HE'S OUT BACK
AND HE'S GOT COMPANY.

28:51.830 --> 28:54.094
(Paul) JUST LET ME GO, MAN.
(grunts)

28:54.130 --> 28:57.099
I DIDN'T TAKE YOUR MONEY, MAN.
IT WASN'T ME.

28:57.130 --> 28:58.688
(Paul grunts)

28:58.730 --> 29:00.322
IT WASN'T ME!

29:00.370 --> 29:01.530
GET IN THE CAR!

29:01.570 --> 29:02.696
HEY!

29:02.740 --> 29:04.264
(engine rewing,
tires screeching)

29:04.310 --> 29:07.029
HEY! POLICE! STOP THE CAR NOW!

29:07.070 --> 29:09.675
(Sam) HOLSTER THAT WEAPON!

29:09.710 --> 29:11.348
COLLINS!
HOLSTER THAT WEAPON!

29:11.380 --> 29:12.347
I CAN SHOOT THE TIRE OUT!

29:12.380 --> 29:14.018
YEAH. PUT IT AWAY!

29:14.050 --> 29:15.039
(car horn honks, tires screech)

29:15.080 --> 29:16.445
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

29:16.480 --> 29:18.687
IF YOU SHOOT OUT THE TIRE
OF A CAR GOING THAT FAST? HUH?

29:18.720 --> 29:22.417
TAGS ARE FROM NEW YORK STATE.
ALPHA-OSCAR-CHARLIE-8-9-6-3.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.484
LEAST YOU DID
SOMETHING RIGHT.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.919
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,
I MAKE THAT SHOT.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.985
IS THAT RIGHT?
YOU JUST MISSED TWICE.

29:27.030 --> 29:29.021
IF YOU HADN'T CHASED Al-TER HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

29:29.060 --> 29:31.699
WE'D BE TAILING HIM IN OUR CAR
INSTEAD OF SHOOTING OFF ROUNDS

29:31.730 --> 29:34.528
IN THE STREET. JERRY, IT'S SAM.
WE JUST LOST SALENKO.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.467
(grunts)

29:41.540 --> 29:44.247
VLADO BOBAS,
DRUG TRAFFICKER FROM ROCHESTER.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.009
OUR MURDER VICTIM,
JESSE SALENKO,

29:46.050 --> 29:48.041
AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER,
WORK FOR THIS GUY,

29:48.080 --> 29:49.741
RUNNING COCAINE
ACROSS THE BORDER.

29:49.780 --> 29:51.008
DRUG SQUAD FOUND OUT

29:51.050 --> 29:52.415
THAT THEY DIDN'T PAY UP
AFTER THE SHIPMENT.

29:52.450 --> 29:53.644
THEY OWED HIM 50 GRAND.

29:53.690 --> 29:55.453
SO WHAT, HE COMES TO COLLECT,
THEY DON'T PAY,

29:55.490 --> 29:58.220
AND THEN THIS JESSE KID
GETS A KNIFE IN THE RIBS?

29:58.260 --> 30:00.728
AND THEN THEY GRAB HIS KID
BROTHER RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER US.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.489
OKAY, SO IF WE FIND THE KID
WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR,

30:02.530 --> 30:03.963
WE GOT BOBAS.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.991
IF NOT, WE'RE GONNA BE FISHING
THE KID OUT OF ASHBRIDGES BAY--

30:06.030 --> 30:07.224
BOBAS IS LONG GONE.

30:07.270 --> 30:08.897
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S GET 'EM.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.133
I WILL GO BACK TO THE DESK.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.470
ALL RIGHT.
CALL GUNS & GANGS.

30:17.510 --> 30:20.104
GET LOCAL ADDRESSES
FOR KNOWN ASSOCIATES.

30:20.150 --> 30:22.448
YEAH, I'LL GET NASH
TO CALL BORDER SERVICES

30:22.480 --> 30:23.447
IN CASE THEY HEAD TO NEW YORK.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.549
VERY GOOD.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.887
WHAT CAN I DO?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.650
OKAY--
(man) I WILL PROSECUTE
THIS ENTIRE DIVISION

30:28.690 --> 30:30.612
IF MY FIANCEE IS NOT
RELEASED IMMEDIATELY.

30:30.660 --> 30:31.786
I CAN MAKE THE CALL.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.025
I'M AN ATTORNEY
WITH SHEPHARD & BLAKE.

30:34.060 --> 30:36.995
AND I AM AN OFFICER
WITH CALM YOUR ASS DOWN.

30:37.030 --> 30:39.965
SO YOU LOWER VOICE AND YOU SPEAK
TO ME LIKE I'M A HUMAN BEING.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.434
MY FIANCEE IS BEING UNDULY
DETAINED DESPITE THE FACT

30:42.470 --> 30:45.598
THAT SHE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED
WITNESS TESTIMONY.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.834
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

30:46.870 --> 30:48.576
I NEED TO HOLD ON TO THE BRIDE
A LITTLE LONGER.

30:48.610 --> 30:51.204
NO, NO. I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.399
JUST MAKE HIM GO AWAY.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.974
JUST--JERRY, JUST GIVE ME
TEN MORE MINUTES.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.544
I HAVE A FEELING THE BRIDE'S
STILL HIDING SOMETHING,

30:55.580 --> 30:56.808
SO IF I CAN GET HER TO T--

30:56.850 --> 30:58.818
OKAY, UNLESS SHE'S HIDING
PAUL SALENKO IN HER PURSE,

30:58.850 --> 31:00.488
I NEED YOU TO
PUT THOSE FEELINGS ASIDE

31:00.520 --> 31:02.909
AND JUST RELEASE HER,
PLEASE.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.222
(Cole) IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE
WHO ACTUALLY KNOWS

31:04.260 --> 31:05.852
WHAT THE LAW SAYS?

31:05.890 --> 31:08.427
TRACE. BRIDE'S
BREATHALYZER TEST RESULTS.

31:08.460 --> 31:11.793
UM, THERE WERE DRUGS IN THE CAR,
SO WE GAVE HER A DRUG TEST, TOO.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.525
TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE?

31:13.570 --> 31:15.788
YEAH, I MEAN, MUST HAVE BELONGED
TO ONE OF THE OTHER GIRLS.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.308
BUT SHE TOLD US THAT SHE WAS
DOING COCAINE WITH THE VICTIM

31:18.340 --> 31:19.568
BEHIND THE CLUB.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.407
OKAY, BUT WHY WOULD SHE
LIE TO A POLICE OFFICER

31:21.440 --> 31:23.704
ABOUT TAKING ILLEGAL DRUGS,
IF SHE WAS CLEAN?

31:25.080 --> 31:27.446
(sighs) OKAY, C--JUST-_
CAN YOU HELP NOELLE WITH THE--

31:27.480 --> 31:29.778
WITH THE GROOM? I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT ANGELA.

31:29.820 --> 31:31.549
ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT JERRY?

31:31.590 --> 31:33.148
SCREW JERRY.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.715
TEST SAYS YOU WEREN'T
ON ANY DRUGS LAST NIGHT.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.387
(door closes)

31:39.430 --> 31:41.227
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
BEHIND THE CLUB WITH JESSE?

31:42.830 --> 31:44.559
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

31:45.630 --> 31:47.268
ANGELA...

31:47.300 --> 31:49.097
I'M TRYING TO SOLVE A MURDER.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.131
YOU'RE ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE
WHO HAD CONTACT WITH THE VICTIM.

31:51.170 --> 31:53.309
JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.846
JESSE BOUGHT ME A FEW DRINKS.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.940
HE WAS CUTE AND FUNNY, AND...

32:01.980 --> 32:04.448
HE COULD TELL
I WAS STRESSED OUT, SO HE...

32:04.490 --> 32:06.446
ASKED ME IF I WANTED
TO GO BACK TO HIS PLACE

32:06.490 --> 32:07.957
AND BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

32:07.990 --> 32:10.515
SO YOU DID? YOU DIDN'T?
DID YOU GO BACK WITH HIM?

32:10.560 --> 32:11.822
I WAS GOING TO.

32:11.860 --> 32:14.090
YEAH, I THOUGHT,
"WHAT'S ONE LITTLE TRANSGRESSION

32:14.130 --> 32:16.690
BEFORE A LIFETIME
OF COMMITMENT?"

32:18.730 --> 32:21.563
UH, BUT THEN
HIS BROTHER SHOWED UP, AND...

32:21.600 --> 32:22.965
THEY BOTH DISAPPEARED.

32:24.870 --> 32:26.360
(sighs)

32:27.370 --> 32:30.271
COLE WANTED TO GET MARRIED
SO BADLY,

32:30.310 --> 32:33.905
AND I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO THINK
THAT I WASN'T READY,

32:33.950 --> 32:36.316
AND I THOUGHT THAT
IF I PRETENDED LONG ENOUGH,

32:36.350 --> 32:38.818
IT WOULD START TO FEEL REAL.

32:38.850 --> 32:42.217
YEAH, FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.
TRUST ME, I'VE BEEN THERE.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.881
I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.784
WE'VE SEARCHED HIS CAR,

32:47.830 --> 32:51.288
WE'VE TALKED TO
HIS KNOWN ASSOCIATES, WE'VE...

32:51.330 --> 32:53.127
CHECKED HIS APARTMENT
ON DUNDAS,

32:53.170 --> 32:55.661
AND ALL OF OUR LEADS ARE
COMING UP EMPTY, so... (sighs)

32:55.700 --> 32:57.964
IF YOU CAN THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE...

32:58.010 --> 33:00.228
JESSE DIDN'T LIVE ON DUNDAS.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.498
(button clicks)

33:01.540 --> 33:04.304
HE LIVED AT 418 HASTINGS.

33:05.710 --> 33:08.679
HE TEXTED ME HIS ADDRESS SO
I COULD MEET UP WITH HIM LATER.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.478
HELLO?

33:18.530 --> 33:20.851
HELLO--
YEAH, I HATE THIS PHONE.

33:20.890 --> 33:24.098
JESSE SALENKO HAS A LOl-T
AT QUEEN AND HASTINGS.

33:24.130 --> 33:25.495
I THOUGHT HE LIVED
WITH HIS BROTHER.

33:25.530 --> 33:28.169
HE DOES. THIS APARTMENT
ISN'T IN THE SYSTEM.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.668
OKAY, YEAH,
THAT'S WORTH A SHOT.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.514
(Sam) COLLINS.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.159
PERIMETER.

33:50.190 --> 33:51.282
BUT THIS IS
THE PART I'M GOOD AT.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.581
GUYS, YOU READY?

33:53.660 --> 33:54.888
STAY CLOSE.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.625
NASH, WE'RE GOOD.

33:58.670 --> 33:59.625
TAKEDOWN.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.160
(bang)

34:01.200 --> 34:02.929
(Sam) POLICE!
DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE!

34:02.970 --> 34:06.098
GET DOWN! DO_ NOT MOVE!
(crackllng)

34:06.140 --> 34:07.801
(Nick) STOP STRUGGLING,
IT'LL STOP HURTING.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.900
(thud, Bobas moaning)

34:14.010 --> 34:15.318
THAN KS.

34:15.350 --> 34:16.772
(Paul coughs)

34:18.620 --> 34:22.078
(panﬁng)

34:22.120 --> 34:25.248
THIS IS MCNALLY.
THE ROOM IS SECURE.

34:29.630 --> 34:31.860
(Andy) COME ON. LET'S GO.

34:37.970 --> 34:41.007
HEY. FOUND IT UNDER
THE BOTTOM DRESSER DRAWER.

34:41.040 --> 34:44.669
IT'S WHERE I USED TO KEEP
MY CONTRABAND AT THE BASE.

34:44.710 --> 34:47.076
NO, NO, THAT'S NASH'S WIN.

34:47.110 --> 34:48.509
(car door closes)

34:51.790 --> 34:54.759
SEE THEM PUT YOU
BACK IN UNIFORM Al-TER THIS.

34:54.790 --> 34:56.052
(chuckles)

34:56.090 --> 34:57.614
HOOAH.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.128
[chatter over p.a.]

35:01.160 --> 35:04.163
JESSE--THE VICTIM--HE WANTED TO
SELL THE SHIPMENT AT A MARKUP,

35:04.200 --> 35:06.293
PAY BOBAS BACK HIS MONEY,
AND KEEP THE DIFFERENCE.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.594
SO HOW'D HE END UP
WITH A KNIFE IN HIS RIBS?

35:08.640 --> 35:10.198
WELL, BOBAS SHOWED UP AT
THEIR LOl-T, DEMANDING HIS MONEY,

35:10.240 --> 35:11.537
AND JESSE WASN'T THERE,

35:11.570 --> 35:13.458
SO HIS LITTLE BROTHER
WENT TO THE CLUB TO WARN HIM--

35:13.510 --> 35:14.670
BOBAS MUST HAVE
FOLLOWED HIM.

35:14.710 --> 35:16.302
HE FOUND JESSE IN THE CAR,
AND HE STABBED HIM.

35:16.340 --> 35:17.409
ANYTHING ELSE?

35:17.440 --> 35:18.407
WELL, YOU KNOW,

35:18.450 --> 35:19.678
ACCORDING TO
HIS LITTLE BROTHER,

35:19.710 --> 35:21.746
JESSE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
A RUNNER HIS WHOLE LIFE.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.180
HE WANTED RESPECT, HE WANTED
PEOPLE TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY,

35:24.220 --> 35:26.643
AND... HE GOT TOO BIG TOO FAST.

35:26.690 --> 35:29.557
SO I GOT IN CONTACT
WITH THE ROCHESTER P.D.,

35:29.590 --> 35:32.354
AND THEY WILL BE SHUTTING DOWN
BOBAS' OPERATION IN THE MORNING.

35:32.390 --> 35:34.290
WELL DONE. YOU, TOO.

35:34.330 --> 35:38.164
STICK WITH THIS GUY,
YOU'LL BE PERMANENT, NO TIME.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.191
THANK YOU, SIR.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.503
I'M SO GLAD WE CAN STILL
BE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW,

35:45.540 --> 35:46.666
AI-TER EVERYTHING.

35:46.710 --> 35:48.530
ME, TOO.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.005
SO I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE PARKING LOT?

35:51.040 --> 35:53.543
ACTUALLY, I'M PROBABLY
GONNA GO STRAIGHT HOME.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.275
I'LL JUST CATCH A RIDE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.571
YOU'RE NOT COMING
TO THE PENNY?

35:56.620 --> 35:57.973
NO WAY.

35:58.020 --> 35:59.749
WELL, WE'RE CELEBRATING
TRACI'S FIRST DAY.

35:59.790 --> 36:02.782
I MEAN, DRINKS ARE ON ANDY.
OW! WHAT THE HELL WAS--

36:02.820 --> 36:04.185
DID YOU FEEL THAT?

36:04.230 --> 36:06.528
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MY HEAD
FEELS Al-TER LAST NIGHT.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.699
I'M GOING HOME.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.459
(sighs) OH...

36:10.500 --> 36:13.526
AND BY THE WAY,
I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PUKED

36:13.570 --> 36:15.538
IN THE BACKSEAT OF YOUR CAR
ON THE RIDE IN THIS MORNING.

36:15.570 --> 36:16.798
WHAT?

36:16.840 --> 36:18.432
STILL FRIENDS?

36:18.470 --> 36:21.030
YOU AND ME?
TO THE END OF TIME?

36:22.280 --> 36:24.373
HEY, TRACE,
LET ME DO THAT.

36:24.410 --> 36:26.401
DON'T.

36:26.450 --> 36:30.409
WE'RE PARTNERS, RIGHT?
SO YOUR MESS IS MY MESS.

36:30.450 --> 36:31.815
YEAH.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.909
THAT'S WHY I TOOK
THE HIT WITH FRANK.

36:36.090 --> 36:39.423
YOU ALSO GAVE UP ON ME TODAY.

36:39.460 --> 36:40.779
I MADE A MISTAKE

36:40.830 --> 36:43.298
AND I NEEDED YOU TO LET ME
FIX IT, NOT DISMISS ME.

36:43.330 --> 36:46.766
TRACE, I-I DON'T
WANT YOU TAKING A FALL

36:46.800 --> 36:49.291
FOR MAKING A DECISION THAT
WASN'T YOURS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.534
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

36:50.570 --> 36:52.435
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

36:52.470 --> 36:55.075
I MEAN, YOU--
YOU PROVED THAT TODAY.

36:55.110 --> 36:57.874
TRACE, YOU ARE
A DYNAMITE DETECTIVE.

37:08.150 --> 37:10.789
LOOK, I'M, UH...

37:10.820 --> 37:13.323
I HAVEN'T BEEN...

37:13.930 --> 37:16.455
HANDLING THINGS WELL...

37:18.300 --> 37:19.995
AND I'M SORRY.

37:20.030 --> 37:21.759
OKAY?

37:23.070 --> 37:25.538
I LOVE HAVING YOU
AS A PARTNER.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.338
MM?

37:40.250 --> 37:41.956
(Oliver) HEY, HONEY?

37:41.990 --> 37:44.527
HEY. HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
(chuckles)

37:44.560 --> 37:47.051
I ALMOST PEPPER-SPRAYED
A LAWYER IN A TUXEDO.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.523
ALL RIGHT. SEE?

37:48.560 --> 37:50.892
THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON
TO BE BACK ON THE BEAT WITH US.

37:50.930 --> 37:52.397
I CAN'T.

37:52.430 --> 37:54.933
LOOK, JUST TALK
TO FRANK, OKAY?

37:54.970 --> 37:57.029
HE'LL BE POWERLESS
AGAINST THOSE DIMPLES.
