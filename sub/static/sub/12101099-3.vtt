31:28.083 --> 31:30.125
We know you created
the super-soldier serum.

31:30.208 --> 31:31.750
Get out of my lab.

31:31.833 --> 31:32.917
SAM: Hey!

31:34.875 --> 31:36.292
You know who he is, right?

31:37.750 --> 31:39.583
This is Baron Zemo.

31:39.667 --> 31:41.542
I know you've heard of him, too, right?

31:42.667 --> 31:44.625
You seem like a pretty smart guy.

31:44.708 --> 31:46.958
So you better become
conversational real quick.

31:47.042 --> 31:49.458
How about a counter proposal?

31:50.333 --> 31:52.625
Make me a better offer and I'll talk.

32:45.958 --> 32:47.042
(GROANING)

32:51.083 --> 32:55.167
I was brought into HYDRA's Winter Soldier
program to pick up their work

32:55.250 --> 32:57.542
after the five
failed test subjects in Siberia.

32:58.833 --> 33:02.000
When HYDRA fell,
I was recruited by the CIA.

33:02.083 --> 33:04.833
They had blood samples
from an American test subject

33:04.917 --> 33:08.333
with semi-stable traces
of serum in his system.

33:09.792 --> 33:16.083
After much labor, I was able to isolate
the necessary compounds in his blood.

33:16.792 --> 33:19.333
I was a god.

33:20.833 --> 33:25.458
I did what no other scientist
since Erskine was able to do.

33:25.542 --> 33:32.542
But mine was going to be different.
No clunky machines or jacked up bodies.

33:32.625 --> 33:36.750
Mine was going to be subtle, optimized,

33:38.417 --> 33:39.417
perfect.

33:40.167 --> 33:41.750
How have we never heard about this?

33:41.833 --> 33:42.917
Because...

33:43.875 --> 33:47.417
Before I was able to complete my work,
I turned to dust.

33:48.583 --> 33:51.958
Then when I returned,
it was five years later,

33:53.208 --> 33:56.083
program had been abandoned,
so I came here.

33:57.125 --> 34:01.708
The Power Broker was more than happy
to fund the recreation of my work.

34:02.292 --> 34:03.792
How many vials did you make?

34:05.208 --> 34:06.375
Twenty.

34:07.625 --> 34:11.125
Karli Morgenthau stole those, so...

34:12.333 --> 34:13.708
I can only imagine

34:13.792 --> 34:16.417
what the Power Broker
has planned for that poor girl.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.833
SAM: Where's Karli now?
DR. NAGEL: I don't know where she is.

34:18.917 --> 34:20.208
But a couple of days ago,

34:20.292 --> 34:23.958
she called and asked if I
could help someone named Donya Madani.

34:25.125 --> 34:26.708
Poor woman has tuberculosis.

34:26.792 --> 34:31.125

in displacement camps like that.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.792

Come back to the States with us.

I can't. Just get me

No.

-Yes, we do.

you'd end up here, doing this?

39:17.792 --> 39:19.833
I was always scrambling for a way out.

39:20.792 --> 39:24.208
Even thought about jumping in with
the military, at one point, but, uh...

39:24.292 --> 39:27.208
apparently mob security
in Madripoor paid better.

39:28.708 --> 39:30.375
I always thought I'd be a teacher.

-Bit of a tough profession in Madripoor?
-Never thought I'd end up there,

39:42.792 --> 39:46.875
but then when everybody returned,
and we got put out on the street,

39:47.542 --> 39:49.000
I knew it was the only place

39:49.083 --> 39:51.375
that had something
that I could use to protect us.

39:53.625 --> 39:56.250
Do you remember how scared we were
when we took the serum?

39:56.333 --> 39:58.458
Felt like my veins were on fire.

39:59.958 --> 40:01.042
Prayed it'd kill me.

because this world is ours.

to give it to the kids in those camps.

catch up with us eventually, right?

40:28.000 --> 40:30.167
The Power Broker is about to come begging.

40:31.375 --> 40:33.417
So we just have
the one fight ahead of us then?

40:33.500 --> 40:34.542
I'll take those odds.

40:35.917 --> 40:38.250

after all this is over?

were here on the same day this happened?

anything to do with him getting out?

Bucky would've broken Zemo out of prison?

of something without evidence.

run with this one for a minute.

you think they're gonna
sweat us on the how?

41:48.375 --> 41:51.167

41:54.250 --> 41:58.625
how many people have to get steamrolled
to make way for this hunk of metal.

41:59.792 --> 42:03.375
Well, it depends on who you ask.
That hunk of metal saved a lot of lives.

42:03.458 --> 42:05.333
Yeah, I get that. All right.

42:07.167 --> 42:08.417

-BUCKY: You did.
-Yeah.

42:11.875 --> 42:15.250
Maybe I shouldn't have put it in a museum.
I should have destroyed it.
