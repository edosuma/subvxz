WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:04.471
(snoring)

00:05.631 --> 00:06.723
Ahh!

00:06.924 --> 00:07.925
Morning, Dipper.

00:08.132 --> 00:09.510
Guess who.

00:09.718 --> 00:10.970
Oh, what joy.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.772
If it isn't
Mr. Upsidedownington.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.524
How long has it been?
Third grade maybe?

00:15.724 --> 00:18.022
That's right, and I'm here
to deliver you

00:18.227 --> 00:21.356
an Upsidedownington-tastic
message!

00:21.563 --> 00:22.940
Is it the message that
we're getting too old

00:23.148 --> 00:24.149
for this sort of thing?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.826
Um, kinda, actually.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.074
It's that we're exactly
one week away

00:28.278 --> 00:30.827
from our 13th birthday!

00:32.783 --> 00:36.128
Whoa! Our birthday's
coming up already?

00:36.328 --> 00:38.547
Soon we're gonna be
actual teenagers!

00:38.747 --> 00:41.341
Finally I can stop reading
pre-teen magazines,

00:41.542 --> 00:44.136
and start reading
post-pre-teen magazines.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.805
PG-13 movies,
here I come.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.342
And just one more year
until high school.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.348
High school, Dipper!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.054
Where girls
become women,

00:53.262 --> 00:54.809
and they teach us
stuff about...

00:56.139 --> 00:57.391
you know what.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.851
Trigonometry?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.652
0h, yea h, baby.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.320
That's not the only
good news coming up.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.068
In one week, my senior
citizen ponytail kit

01:04.272 --> 01:05.741
is coming in the mail.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.912
I'm... I'm kinda going
through some things.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.241
In one week, my grandma
is finally letting me

01:13.448 --> 01:14.665
eat crackers
on my bed.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.369
The future is coming
for us all, dudes.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.251
- The future.
- The future.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.206
The future!

01:21.415 --> 01:23.088
I'm sorry, I can't
take you seriously

01:23.292 --> 01:24.589
with that face
on your chin.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.716
(goofy voice)
What face, Dipper?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.763
You're doing the voice,
so you obviously know

01:28.964 --> 01:29.886
what I'm talking about.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.309
(goofy voice) I don't
know what you're talking about.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.227
(both laughing)

01:34.428 --> 01:36.055
There is something
wrong with you.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.357
There's something wrong
with both of us.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.292
All right,
party planners.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.494
In one week,
we become teenagers,

01:59.703 --> 02:02.297
and summer vacation
winds to an end,

02:02.497 --> 02:04.090
so we need to throw
the greatest party of all time!

02:04.291 --> 02:07.966
I'm talkin' pifiatas
with tinier pifiatas inside.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.967
Boom, dreams comin' true.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.516
I'm talkin' inviting
everyone in town.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.013
Let's see.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.766
Where do we stand
with the gnomes?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.813
Not so fast,
goof us and girl goof us.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.565
After that
zombie incident,

02:20.766 --> 02:22.860
no one's throwing
another party at my house.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.487
I keep finding little bits of the
undead in the couch cushions.

02:25.687 --> 02:29.066
But Grunkle Stan,
we need some roof to raise.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.197
Dude, you can rent out the
Gravity Falls high school gym,

02:31.401 --> 02:33.403
and have your party there.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.330
That place is empty
all summer long.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.077
The gym's
a great idea, Soos.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.579
To the high school!

02:38.784 --> 02:40.627
(loud crash)

02:40.827 --> 02:43.080
FORD: Dipper, my face
is on fire!

02:43.288 --> 02:44.915
I'll just be
a second.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.675
Hey, Uncle Ford,
are you okay?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.593
Oh, yes, I'm fine.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.421
I just said that to make sure
you'd come in here.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.506
But your face
<i>is</i> on fire.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.216
Yes. It's much faster
than shaving.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.222
Now listen, Dipper.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.019
I have a very important
mission, and you are

02:58.220 --> 03:00.063
the only one
who can help me.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.732
Remember the rift in dimensional
space-time I showed you?

03:02.933 --> 03:04.651
It's cracking.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.728
This is what Bill
has been waiting for.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.440
If it breaks, it'll cause
reality as we know it

03:09.648 --> 03:11.241
to become completely
unraveled.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.284
A hypothetical
and catastrophic event

03:13.485 --> 03:15.158
I call Weirdmageddon.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.742
Bill is out there,
and he'd use any trick

03:20.951 --> 03:22.419
from deception to
outright possession

03:22.619 --> 03:24.462
to make this happen.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.290
But for the sake of humanity,
we mustn't let him.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.466
- What do we do?
- We patch the rift.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.136
I'll explain on the way.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.304
- Wait. What about Mabel?
- It's okay, Dipper.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.848
You should totally
go with Grunkle Ford

03:35.048 --> 03:36.425
to save the world
or whatever.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.976
Are you sure?

03:38.135 --> 03:40.183
We're gonna be doing
birthday junk all week.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.515
Plus, I packed
those walkie-talkies.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.066
Here's one for
my party mission,

03:44.266 --> 03:45.609
and one for
your smarty mission.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.436
(laughing)

03:47.644 --> 03:49.521
Ahem. I did mention
that the fate of the universe

03:49.730 --> 03:50.822
is at stake,
didn't I?

03:51.022 --> 03:52.774
Hurry. We haven't
much time.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.782
Okay, Dipper, it's your first
big mission with Ford,

03:55.986 --> 03:57.363
a chance to prove yourself.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.448
Don't mess this up.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.158
Ow! Ha ha.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.868
I'm all right.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.498
(crashing)

04:11.626 --> 04:14.630
Whoa, Soos, I thought
you said this place was empty.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.589
MY d095, what up?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.892
Wendy, what are
you doing here?

04:19.091 --> 04:20.844
Ugh. High school registration.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.895
Oh! You know, I'm only
a year away

04:23.096 --> 04:24.689
from high school
myself.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.563
Would you say
your experience

04:26.767 --> 04:28.690
is more rom-com
or wacky romp?

04:28.894 --> 04:30.988
More like
teen horror movie.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.272
High school
is the worst.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.199
Classes get
super hard,

04:34.399 --> 04:36.618
your body just
flat-out turns against you,

04:36.818 --> 04:39.287
and worst of all,
everybody hates you.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.708
Can't do it.
Can't do another year.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.628
My hormones are like
a sweaty cage.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.832
Why aren't they singing
about following their dreams?

04:50.040 --> 04:53.635
TV taught me that high school
is like some sort of musical.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.257
TV lied, man.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.089
If you can avoid
growing up, do it.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.015
I'd give anything
to be 12 again.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.972
Anyway, what are
you guys doing here?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.636
(nervous chuckle)
Just looking for a place

05:02.844 --> 05:05.313
to have my 13th
birthday party.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.766
Wendy Borduroy?

05:06.973 --> 05:08.725
I mean Corduroy.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.062
- (laughter)
- Corduroy.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.731
See what I mean?

05:18.944 --> 05:21.197
Master Mabel
to Dippity Dog.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.997
We can have our party
at the gym,

05:23.156 --> 05:24.624
but we gotta talk
about high school.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.702
I'm starting to think
it's might not be

05:26.910 --> 05:29.333
the awesome future
we were expecting. Over.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.165
<i>I'm going through
a bad patch, Mabel.</i>

05:31.373 --> 05:33.421
<i>We'll talk when
I get back...</i> (static).

05:33.625 --> 05:35.127
Dipper? Come in,
come in?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.962
Hey, I know what will
make you feel better.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.797
Let's deliver some invites
to your friends, huh?

05:39.005 --> 05:40.131
Yeah!

05:46.137 --> 05:47.730
(static)

05:47.931 --> 05:49.729
Mabel?
Mabel, you there?

05:49.933 --> 05:51.776
(frustrated groan)

05:51.977 --> 05:53.650
Listen, Dipper, in order
to seal the rift for good,

05:53.854 --> 05:55.356
it's going to take
an adhesive

05:55.564 --> 05:56.816
stronger than
anything on Earth.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.072
Something...
extraterrestrial in origin.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.532
What do you mean?

06:01.736 --> 06:03.955
Tipper, look at
the peculiar shape

06:04.155 --> 06:05.452
made by those cliffs.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.534
Does it remind you
of anything?

06:07.742 --> 06:10.086
Hmm...

06:17.335 --> 06:19.087
Shut...up

06:19.254 --> 06:21.552
According to my research,
the entire valley

06:21.756 --> 06:24.851
of Gravity Valley was formed
when an extraterrestrial object

06:25.051 --> 06:27.679
crash landed here
millions of years ago.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.687
FORD: Did this craft cause
the town's strange properties?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.939
Or, did the town's
strange properties

06:33.143 --> 06:34.611
attract the craft?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.484
The answer is
still unknown.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.190
But that's crazy!

06:38.398 --> 06:39.775
Where did the saucer go?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.735
Sometimes, the strangest
things in the world

06:41.943 --> 06:44.037
are right under
our noses.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.205
And our feet, in this
particular instance.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.750
Now, you might want
to stand back.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.668
This magnet gun could
rip the fillings

06:50.869 --> 06:52.371
out of a man's mouth
from a hundred feet.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.627
Sure.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.459
I used to raid this thing
for parts for years.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.463
FORD: Where do you think
I got the materials

06:58.668 --> 06:59.965
to build my portal?

07:00.170 --> 07:03.891
You-- I...words,
not working from mouth.

07:04.090 --> 07:04.966
Now, come.
And take this.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.143
Whoa, Whoa!

07:07.302 --> 07:09.304
Don't worry down here
countless times.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.891
All the aliens have been dead
for millions of years.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.646
Probably.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.407
I can't believe there's been
a giant UFO

07:28.615 --> 07:30.333
under the town
this whole time.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.036
I wish my mind could be where
yours is right now, Tipper.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.167
When confirmation
of extraterrestrials

07:35.330 --> 07:36.752
still had that punch.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.006
Now it's just sort of, meh.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.219
McGucket and I used to
come down here all the time

07:45.382 --> 07:48.181
to raid their tech
ad study their language.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.471
This is so cool!

07:51.846 --> 07:52.813
(laughs)

07:53.014 --> 07:54.641
The substance need
so seal the rift

07:54.849 --> 07:57.102
is an alien adhesive,
strong enough to

07:57.310 --> 07:59.062
keep the hull
of a spacecraft together.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.647
Just one dollop of this adhesive

08:00.855 --> 08:02.653
should be enough
to seal a crack in space-time.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.734
Also, if it touches you,
it will seal up

08:04.943 --> 08:06.286
all the orifices
in your face,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.159
so try so avoid that.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.744
Now, use your magnet gun
and follow me!

08:10.949 --> 08:12.201
Hup.
Great Uncle Ford!

08:17.872 --> 08:21.502
Your turn!
Say "hup". It helps!

08:21.710 --> 08:25.465
Okay, just put on magnet,
leap down hole.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.219
Turn on.
Come on already!

08:27.382 --> 08:29.134
(powering up)

08:29.342 --> 08:30.514
Magnet!

08:30.719 --> 08:31.971
Hunh!

08:32.178 --> 08:33.895
Aah!

08:34.097 --> 08:35.313
A little help?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.106
Oh, hi, Mabel.

08:43.313 --> 08:46.158
You're just in time
for our one o'clock boy talk.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.828
If you think that's good,
boom!

08:49.029 --> 08:51.248
Me and Dipper's
13th birthday jam!

08:51.406 --> 08:54.376
Oh, man, your birthday's
on the last day of summer.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.793
I'm not gonna be here.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.086
What?

08:57.287 --> 08:59.210
Marius is flying me
out to Austria

08:59.372 --> 09:01.295
to hang out his castle
or whatever that week.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.176
He's co clingy!

09:03.376 --> 09:05.845
You're gonna be
out of town for my birthday?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.014
But at least you can come,
right, Candy?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.888
Sorry, Mabel, my parents
send me to music camp

09:11.092 --> 09:12.309
this time of year.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.097
There is no escape
from music camp.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.309
So neither of you are
gonna be at my birthday party?

09:18.475 --> 09:20.318
And you won't be able
to wish me good-bye

09:20.477 --> 09:21.524
at the end of the summer?

09:21.728 --> 09:24.197
I'm sorry, Mabel.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.865
Summer happens so fast.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.238
(cell phone ringing)

09:27.400 --> 09:30.449
Ugh, Marius,
now's not the time!

09:30.653 --> 09:33.782
I think I need to radio
for emotional backup.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.242
Dipper, please come in.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.331
Our party mission is
going down in flames.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.041
Over.
(static)

09:39.245 --> 09:40.838
Oh...

09:46.544 --> 09:48.171
This is their
storage facility.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.756
This place would have
been heavily guarded,

09:49.964 --> 09:52.262
but now everything's defunct.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.927
Go ahead, flip any switch.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.388
They've all been busted
for millions of years.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.314
Clara, did you eat
my farm?

10:05.480 --> 10:06.902
(mooing)

10:07.107 --> 10:09.155
FORD: The glue should
be around here somewhere,

10:09.359 --> 10:11.453
so keep your eyes peeled.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.576
Dipper, let me ask you
something.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.407
Have you thought much
about your future?

10:15.615 --> 10:16.958
No, not really.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.126
I mean, beyond graduating
high school with a high GPA

10:19.327 --> 10:20.954
so I can get accepted
to a good technical college

10:21.162 --> 10:22.505
with a photography
and media production minor

10:22.705 --> 10:24.173
to start my own
ghost hunting show.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.876
Ha ha ha!

10:26.084 --> 10:28.178
It's like talking to
a younger version of myself.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.301
If you're so sure of
what you want out of life,

10:30.463 --> 10:32.932
why waste? Why put up
with the drudgery of school?

10:33.133 --> 10:36.307
Huh, trust me, I'd love to fast
forward the whole thing, but

10:36.469 --> 10:38.346
not like I have a choice.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.560
Dipper, I've been thinking.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.061
I'm getting too old
to investigate

10:41.266 --> 10:42.688
Gravity Falls
on my own.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.520
I need to train an apprentice
to help me fight monsters,

10:45.728 --> 10:47.901
solve mysteries,
and protect this town.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.575
And I think I'd like
to keep it in the family

10:50.775 --> 10:52.152
What are you saying?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.862
I've read your additions
to my journal,

10:54.070 --> 10:55.743
and I'm impressed
with your potential.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.665
What would you say to
staying in Gravity Falls

10:57.866 --> 11:00.085
after the summer ends
and becoming my apprentice?

11:00.285 --> 11:01.832
What about school?

11:02.036 --> 11:04.038
Dipper, I have 12 PhDs.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.419
Your parents would be thrilled

11:05.582 --> 11:07.255
I could give you
such an advanced education.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.301
(sighs)
There's also Mabel.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.254
She'd be all alone
in California.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.385
Mabel will be fine
on her own.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.346
She has a magnetic
personality.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.430
I watched her
become pen pals

11:16.593 --> 11:17.685
with the pizza
delivery man

11:17.886 --> 11:19.388
in the 60 seconds
he was at the door.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.273
Gosh, we've never really
been apart before.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.020
And isn't it suffocating?

11:24.225 --> 11:25.727
Dipper, can you honestly
tell me

11:25.935 --> 11:29.235
you never felt like you were
meant for something more?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.861
I hav--
I don't know.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.738
Sounds like
a dream come true,

11:32.942 --> 11:35.695
but I'm not sure I have
what it takes.

11:35.904 --> 11:36.905
Was tricked by Bill,

11:37.113 --> 11:39.161
I was wrong about
Stan's portal.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.835
Heck, I can't even operate
this magnet gun right.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.333
(straining)

11:44.537 --> 11:46.005
Ha! Yes.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.755
Dipper, you found
the adhesive!

11:48.958 --> 11:50.585
Oh-ho, you really
did it, kid.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.136
Huddle in, let's get
a picture of this.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.839
(alien noise)

11:54.047 --> 11:56.800
Uh, Uncle Ford, you said
everything down here

11:57.008 --> 11:58.260
is dead, right?

11:58.468 --> 12:01.563
Yes, unless somehow we
reactivated the...

12:01.763 --> 12:03.515
(gasps)
security system

12:06.351 --> 12:07.694
What do we do?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.237
Listen to me
very carefully.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.280
I've studied these.
They're security droids,

12:11.481 --> 12:12.607
and they detect
adrenaline.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.614
You simply have to
not feel any fear,

12:15.818 --> 12:17.365
-and they won't see you.
- What?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.072
It's okay.
I've done it before.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.248
Just take a deep breath,
focus on your intellect,

12:21.449 --> 12:23.668
and control your fear.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.417
Wh-wh-what?
that's crazy! I--

12:26.579 --> 12:27.455
Follow my lead!

12:27.622 --> 12:28.498
Great Uncle ford...

12:28.665 --> 12:29.962
Focus, Dipper!

12:30.166 --> 12:32.214
(heartbeat)

12:32.418 --> 12:34.671
I, uh...
I-I-

12:35.838 --> 12:37.715
I can't.
Get down!

12:46.557 --> 12:48.685
Aah! No!
Nooooo...

12:48.893 --> 12:49.985
Wait! No!

12:50.186 --> 12:52.564
Stay back.
It's too dangerous.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.399
Sealing the rift is
what's important now.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.733
Take this.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.825
You're gonna have to
do it without me.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.077
Use the adhesive.
Fix the rift!

13:02.282 --> 13:04.250
Save the universe,
Dipper.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.123
Great Uncle Ford!

13:08.746 --> 13:10.373
Hang on,
I'm coming for you.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.424
Don't worry,
I'll get you out of there!

13:16.879 --> 13:19.052
Where's that thing
taking you?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.723
FORD: It's an automated
prison droid.

13:22.927 --> 13:26.147
And wherever it's going,
I'm not coming back.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.020
What?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.229
No, no, no.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.441
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.369
Dipper, what on earth
are you doing?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.117
(powering up)

13:42.322 --> 13:43.619
Hold on,
Great Uncle Ford.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.999
I'm getting you out of this
one way or another.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.876
(click, powering down)
Oh, no!

13:51.080 --> 13:52.753
(fizzling)

13:52.957 --> 13:54.550
(beeping, buzzer blares)

13:54.709 --> 13:56.131
Come on, come on!

14:02.050 --> 14:06.601
Aah...

14:16.439 --> 14:18.112
Let go of my uncle!

14:18.316 --> 14:19.238
Ohh. Aah!

14:23.654 --> 14:26.203
Aah...

14:33.539 --> 14:34.836
Oh, no. Aah!

14:35.041 --> 14:42.300
(crying out)

14:42.507 --> 14:43.724
Great Uncle Ford!

14:43.925 --> 14:47.099
Okay, let's try magna-pulse.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.866
(groaning)

15:07.615 --> 15:09.993
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no!

15:12.328 --> 15:14.501
Come on, wake up, man.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.707
We gotta get out of here
before--

15:21.337 --> 15:23.431
Hey, I'm warning you!

15:23.631 --> 15:24.678
I have a magnet gun!

15:27.051 --> 15:28.849
Oh, yeah?
You think you can scare me?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.555
Do your worst!

15:30.763 --> 15:33.562
Nothing in this universe is
gonna take away my uncle.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.189
So go ahead,
Give me what you got.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.156
(panting)

15:48.364 --> 15:54.497
(Ford laughing, coughing)

15:54.704 --> 15:56.798
Are you all right?
what happened?

15:56.998 --> 15:59.751
The orb didn't detect
any chemical signs of fear.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.007
It assumed the threat
was neutralized

16:02.211 --> 16:03.713
and then self-disassembled.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.848
Heh heh heh.
I-- I did it?

16:06.048 --> 16:08.096
You did it.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.347
This is what I was
talking about.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.057
How many other
12-year-olds

16:14.265 --> 16:18.896
do you think are capable
of doing what you've just done?

16:24.734 --> 16:25.826
(sighs)

16:26.027 --> 16:28.906
Hey, everything
a" right, Pumpkin?

16:29.113 --> 16:31.616
I just can't believe
the summer's almost over.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.203
And now that I know how awful
high school's gonna be,

16:35.411 --> 16:38.255
I'm in no hurry
to start that train wreck.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.208
Nobody likes getting
older.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.633
But just because
you're growing up

16:41.834 --> 16:43.302
doesn't mean you have
to grow up, you know?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.176
I mean, look at me.
I'm pushing 70,

16:45.379 --> 16:47.006
and I still eat
ice cream for dinner.

16:47.215 --> 16:50.059
But I don't want to say
good-bye to Gravity Falls.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.637
Hey, at least whatever happens
after this summer,

16:52.845 --> 16:54.313
you'll still have your brother
along with you

16:54.514 --> 16:55.481
through thick and thin.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.979
Not everyone can
say that, you know.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.986
Yeah. At least
when I go home

17:05.191 --> 17:06.568
I always have Dipper.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.403
Good old reliable old...

17:08.611 --> 17:09.612
<i>(radio static)
DIPPER: Are you okay?</i>

17:09.819 --> 17:12.664
<i>Let's get you out of there.</i>

17:12.865 --> 17:15.367
Listen to me, Dipper,
this town is a magnet

17:15.576 --> 17:16.577
for things
that are special.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.584
And that includes
you and me.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.587
It brought both of us here
for a purpose.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.088
Stay here with me,
Dipper.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.292
Become my apprentice.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.719
Don't let anyone
hold you--

17:25.877 --> 17:28.256
(coughing)

17:28.464 --> 17:31.593
I'll do it.
I'm gonna stay.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.098
Excellent.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.226
Now, who wants to save
the world, apprentice?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.182
(both laughing)

17:38.391 --> 17:40.189
(radio static)

17:42.603 --> 17:45.823
Mabel, I just had
the best day of my life.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.110
UFOs are real, and
there's one under the town,

17:48.317 --> 17:50.365
and I saved
Great Uncle Ford's life and--

17:50.570 --> 17:51.913
Hey, are you okay?

17:52.113 --> 17:53.911
Tell me it's not true,
Dipper.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.367
Tell me you were
joking.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.953
(radio static, gasps)

17:58.160 --> 18:00.458
Mabel: Ford's apprentice?
Seriously?

18:00.663 --> 18:02.882
Look, I was thinking,
and this is

18:03.082 --> 18:04.959
a huge opportunity for me.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.421
Well, it's a horrible
opportunity for me!

18:08.629 --> 18:10.802
I had the worst day
of my life.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.184
When we turn 13,
the summer ends,

18:13.384 --> 18:15.102
and I have to leave
everything behind.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.226
You're the only person
I could count on,

18:17.430 --> 18:19.148
and now you're
leaving me, too?

18:19.348 --> 18:20.770
Look, I've been
thinking about it.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.150
I won't be gone
forever, okay?

18:22.351 --> 18:23.648
I'll still
visit you at home

18:23.853 --> 18:25.901
and we'll chat online--
we'll make it work.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.823
I don't want it to work.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.610
I just wish summer
could last forever.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.536
But it can't, Mabel.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.616
Look, things aren't gonna
stay frozen this way.

18:35.823 --> 18:36.949
It's part of growing up.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.705
Things change.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.003
Summer ends.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.375
<i>“Sh!
U “h!</i>

18:42.580 --> 18:43.547
Mabel, wait!

18:43.748 --> 18:45.716
I didn't mean it like that.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.463
Mabel, come back!

18:57.637 --> 19:00.516
Only party chocolate
can cheer me up now.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.101
Nerd bucks?
Chewed up pens?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.687
Ugh, wrong backpack.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.442
It's not fair.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.400
I just wish summer
could last forever.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.861
MAN:
That might be possible.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.951
Sweater Town is not accepting
incoming calls right now.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.702
M-M-Mabel, it's me.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.410
What?
Who said that?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.666
I can help.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.872
The time travel guy?

19:25.039 --> 19:26.336
What are you doing here?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.508
You said you don't want
summer to end, right?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.177
Did I hear that right?

19:30.378 --> 19:31.550
Yeah.

19:31.754 --> 19:32.846
Why are you
asking?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.473
Look, maybe it's
against the rules,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.347
but you once did
a favor for me, so

19:36.550 --> 19:37.426
I thought I could
help you out.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.761
It's called a time bubble,

19:38.969 --> 19:40.767
and it prevents time
from going forward.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.815
Summer in Gravity Falls can last
as long as you want it to.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.646
Really?
But how does it work.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.481
I just need you to get a little
gizmo for me from your uncle.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.818
Something small-- he won't
even know it's missing.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.575
Huh, maybe Dipper has something
like that in his nerd bag.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.700
Let me guess.
Mabel didn't take it well?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.125
I--I don't know.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.078
Maybe I'm making
the wrong decision.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.538
I need to think
about this.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.966
Dipper, right now we need
to focus on the mission.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.547
Now, come on.
I've got the glue.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.845
Hand me the rift
and let's make history.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.056
What?

20:16.257 --> 20:18.555
Oh, no, the rift!

20:18.759 --> 20:21.854
Huh.
That's odd.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.977
Is this it?
Yes, that's it!

20:24.140 --> 20:26.393
Just hand it over and
I'll do my thing.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.103
Unless you're ready
to leave Gravity Falls.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.611
Just a little more summer.

20:36.694 --> 20:37.616
Oops!

20:37.820 --> 20:39.572
What?

20:39.780 --> 20:43.705
(maniacal laughter)

20:45.536 --> 20:47.504
Oh, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

20:48.581 --> 20:49.423
Oh...

20:49.623 --> 20:51.045
(maniacal laughter)

20:51.250 --> 20:54.971
At last.
At long, long last!

20:55.129 --> 20:57.177
The gate between worlds
is open!

20:57.381 --> 20:59.429
The event one billion
years prophesized

20:59.633 --> 21:00.930
has come to pass!

21:01.093 --> 21:04.563
The day has come.
The world is finally mine!

21:04.764 --> 21:07.108
(wind whistling)

21:11.228 --> 21:14.402
(maniacal laughter)

21:20.279 --> 21:21.451
What's going on?

21:21.655 --> 21:23.407
What is that?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.207
We're too late.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.038
It's the end of the world.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.799
(maniacal laughter)

21:52.394 --> 21:55.273
(helicopter passing overhead)
