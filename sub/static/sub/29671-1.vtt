WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:07.466
(air crackling)

00:12.430 --> 00:14.974
(dog barking)

00:19.937 --> 00:22.606
(crowd cheering)

00:25.943 --> 00:31.115
(bell ringing)

00:39.707 --> 00:42.918
(intriguing music)

00:49.759 --> 00:52.511
-  It was
morning again in America.

00:52.678 --> 00:56.140
Millions of men and
women were going to work.

00:58.559 --> 01:03.397
And high up above the
streets, in his Olympic Tower,

01:03.564 --> 01:06.442
one of America's most
celebrated self-made men

01:06.609 --> 01:08.778
- The most successful
single individual

01:08.944 --> 01:10.946
in the history of
American fashion.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.531
Ladies and gentlemen, Halston.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.325
(audio screeching)

01:14.492 --> 01:16.911
-  was
nowhere in sight.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.663
(dramatic music)

01:22.082 --> 01:23.751
- The question that
all of New York

01:23.918 --> 01:26.128
was asking last night was,
whatever happened to Halston?

01:26.295 --> 01:28.881
(static hissing)

01:32.301 --> 01:34.637
- It's a story of high
fashion and high finance,

01:34.804 --> 01:37.723
as one of America's
big names in fashion.

01:37.890 --> 01:42.561
(audio screeching)
(audio test beeping)

01:44.230 --> 01:48.150
-  It was business
as usual, you could say.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.820
They bought his name.

01:50.986 --> 01:54.865
Sold off his life's work
for pennies on the dollar.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.452
And when that wasn't enough,

01:58.619 --> 02:01.997
well, they forced him
out of his own office.

02:02.164 --> 02:06.126
(audio test beeping)
(audio screeching)

02:06.293 --> 02:08.670
Some will say he had it coming.

02:09.672 --> 02:12.716
(audience applauding)

02:14.301 --> 02:17.221
But what he didn't see
coming were the tapes.

02:17.388 --> 02:23.894
All 215 of them, erased, as
per the corporation's order.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.941
(audio screeching)

02:32.194 --> 02:32.945
-  Liza
Minnelli in The Act.

02:33.112 --> 02:34.488
(audience cheering)

02:34.655 --> 02:37.449
- Sportswear, knits,
broadcloth, menswear.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.159
(audio screeching)

02:39.326 --> 02:41.036
This is Andy Warhol's
portrait of me, which was--

02:41.203 --> 02:44.456
-  You see, pictures
meant everything to Halston.

02:44.623 --> 02:47.209
- And texture demands texture.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.128
-  "Life is like
a picture," he used to say.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.005
- Who's that lucky guy?

02:52.464 --> 02:56.176
-  Well, he
got his perfect picture.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.471
Only the price turned
out to be a little high.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.808

-  It all started
in September of 1983,

04:43.534 --> 04:47.371
when Carl Epstein joined
Halston Enterprises.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.166
He was Halston's new
corporate manager,

04:51.333 --> 04:53.043
and he would be his last.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.254
(jazz noir music)

04:55.421 --> 04:58.757
Carl wanted to learn
everything about Halston,

04:58.924 --> 05:00.926
so I brought him the tapes.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.762
Who am I?

05:03.929 --> 05:06.473
Just someone working
in the archives.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.185
Nobody important for
our story, really.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.895
Our story is Halston.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.902
Behind the images flickering
on the screen, who was Halston?

05:21.238 --> 05:23.741
-  I'd like to
go back in time a little bit,

05:23.907 --> 05:25.451
to just how you started.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.662
I know that you started with
hats and worked your way.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.998
- Oh, I--
- Were we gonna move this?

05:31.165 --> 05:32.583
- That's all right.

05:32.750 --> 05:33.417
-  Please
let me know these things.

05:37.463 --> 05:38.672
-  Are we rolling?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.049
- Am I--
- I was straightening the tie.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.592
- Okay.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.135
I don't mind it being
a little disheveled.

05:43.302 --> 05:46.263
- No, no, it's just--
- Oh, okay, thanks.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.767
Halston was the custom
milliner at Bergdorf.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.687
And we lived around the
corner from each other.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.356
So he and I would walk
to work every day.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.400
We'd be talking,
gossiping, having fun.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.611
He was so much fun.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.821
And then the minute we would
arrive to the building,

06:02.988 --> 06:05.199
and you'd have to go
through the revolving door,

06:05.365 --> 06:08.494
suddenly Halston had
arrived at Bergdorf.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.913
And the first time,
it quite shocked me.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.998
And then, of course,
I understood.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.751
He now has put on
his Halston mask.

06:15.918 --> 06:19.129
(elegant big band music)

06:19.296 --> 06:20.672
And the voice would change.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.382
Good morning, ladies.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.594
He was dealing with
the creme de la creme

06:25.761 --> 06:27.346
of women in the world.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.516
-  Were
you the person

06:30.682 --> 06:32.101
who put the pillbox
on Jackie Kennedy?

06:32.267 --> 06:35.395
- Yes, I was.
(reporter chuckles)

06:35.562 --> 06:37.314
-  That hat was genius.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.690
If you look at
the Inauguration,

06:38.857 --> 06:41.485
most of those ladies
wore a mink coat.

06:41.652 --> 06:46.115
Jackie was in a cloth
coat and a cloth hat.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.076
-  I'll never forget
the impact that hat had.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.411
Even out in Montana, where
I was sitting at the time.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.621
- It was a very funny story.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.790
Because it was a
rather windy day,

06:54.957 --> 06:56.458
and she put her
hand on the hat,

06:56.625 --> 06:58.627
and it ended up to
have a dent in it.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.420
And so when, during
all the ceremonies,

07:00.587 --> 07:02.172
it had a dent in the hat.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.508
And everybody who copied
it put a dent in it,

07:04.675 --> 07:07.386
which was so funny.
(reporter laughing)

07:07.553 --> 07:09.513
I was quite a young man,

07:09.680 --> 07:11.765
but then I became very,
very famous quickly on that.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.308
It was the first time in
the history of Bergdorf

07:13.475 --> 07:16.687
that they promoted a
designer personality.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.316
(audio screeching)

07:21.483 --> 07:24.903
And I headed a department
of 150 milliners

07:25.070 --> 07:26.572
and 12 sales ladies.

07:27.739 --> 07:31.285
- Bergdorf was a
very rarefied world.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.330
But he was born in
Des Moines, Iowa, as I read,

07:35.497 --> 07:38.625
because he never
told me any of this.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.087
Halston was so busy
moving forward.

07:42.254 --> 07:45.007
I knew very little about
Halston's personal life.

07:45.174 --> 07:49.261
Certainly, I didn't know
much about his background.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.930
In November of 1966,

07:52.097 --> 07:55.517
there was Truman Capote's
Black and White Ball.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.978
- Everybody wanted to be at
that ball, because it was it,

07:58.145 --> 08:02.983
you know, as far as where
you should go, you know?

08:03.150 --> 08:06.904
- You would measure your social
importance by (chuckling)

08:07.070 --> 08:10.115
the invitation, getting
one or not getting one.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.159
-  Do you know if
he was invited to the ball?

08:12.326 --> 08:16.747
- I would have thought so,
but now you, I have, I'm,

08:16.914 --> 08:20.167
I have my doubts, I
don't know, was he?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.878
- Halston did not have
an invite to the ball.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.589
(epic music)

08:30.469 --> 08:32.261
- Are you rolling, Harvey?

08:32.429 --> 08:35.097
We have filmed this black
and white ball in color

08:35.265 --> 08:36.683
for your enlightenment.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.770
Good heavens, here comes
John Kenneth Galbraith.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.813
The Maharani of Baroda is here.

08:41.980 --> 08:46.568
And the Baroness de Rothchild,
and Mrs. Loel Guinness.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.654
We only tell you this
because we know that

08:48.820 --> 08:51.323
you were not rich, social,
or beautiful enough

08:51.490 --> 08:54.117
to be invited here tonight.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.119
- The irony is

08:56.286 --> 08:59.706
Halston had made more
than 100 masks that night.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.627
Kay Graham, who owned
The Washington Post.

09:03.794 --> 09:04.795
Candice Bergen.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.382
Of course, D.D. Ryan.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.970
D.D. Ryan was certainly one
of the chicest women going.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.514
- That's me,
dancing with Truman

09:16.974 --> 09:20.269
in the mask that
Halston made for me.

09:20.435 --> 09:24.231
-  D.D. Ryan, former
editor and fashion legend.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.317
She had fallen on hard
times since the '60s,

09:27.484 --> 09:29.319
so Halston gave her a job.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.364
- I've known H
from the beginning.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.241
From before the
beginning, really.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.493
Back then, he was
still a milliner.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.830
Milliners didn't go
through the front door.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.540
Different world then.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.334
- I must have said,
are you going?

09:44.501 --> 09:46.378
And he said, "Oh, yes."

09:47.838 --> 09:49.464
That's all I can say.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.551
He didn't tell me everything.

09:52.718 --> 09:56.888
He wasn't invited by Truman,
but he got himself there.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.559
-  Was this Halston?

10:00.726 --> 10:01.560
Or this one?

10:02.644 --> 10:04.521
Was he even at the ball?

10:08.817 --> 10:10.819
He was on everybody's
face that night.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.904
And yet, he was invisible.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.534
- He called me
one day and said,

10:17.701 --> 10:19.453
"There's something that
I need to tell you."

10:19.619 --> 10:23.248
I was in Southampton, I was
invited to a very grand dinner.

10:23.415 --> 10:26.335
Our hostess is a client,
and she likes me,

10:26.501 --> 10:27.669
and she invited me.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.713
And we sat down.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.591
And two of the husbands
never sat down.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.260
They stood behind their
chairs, everybody was seated,

10:35.427 --> 10:37.012
and the hostess looked up.

10:37.179 --> 10:40.098
And they said, "If these
two faggots are at table,

10:40.265 --> 10:42.893
"we will not be joining
you for your dinner."

10:43.060 --> 10:45.937
(gentle piano music)

10:47.814 --> 10:50.901
He said, "Tom, I just
need you to understand

10:51.068 --> 10:52.527
"that you and I could not hope

10:52.694 --> 10:56.907
"to be anything more than
trained faggot poodles,

10:57.074 --> 11:01.578
"to jump through the hoops
of these rich people."

11:06.625 --> 11:08.126
-  The mental
image most people have

11:08.293 --> 11:11.129
of a male homosexual looks
pretty much like this.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.383
A man with effeminate
characteristics.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.051
The film you are now watching

11:16.218 --> 11:18.345
is purposely being projected
in its negative form

11:18.512 --> 11:21.390
to prevent identification
of the people it shows.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.225
The location is a
public bathing beach

11:23.392 --> 11:25.644
at 21st Street on Miami Beach.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.105
The scenes were photographed
with telescopic lenses

11:28.271 --> 11:30.357
from a hidden vantage point.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.150
Despite the negative image,

11:32.317 --> 11:35.779
the actions themselves
are easily recognized.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.616
(upbeat music)

11:42.536 --> 11:45.789
- I met Halston at Fire Island.

11:45.956 --> 11:50.627
He was just, you know, just
a fabulous human being.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.672
And we became fast friends.

11:54.923 --> 11:59.428
♪ This precious time
just kept me waiting ♪

12:00.971 --> 12:06.726
- The freedom of our sexuality
there, life before AIDS.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.650
Halston and I partied
a great deal together.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.070
♪ In a brand new groove ♪

12:17.237 --> 12:19.322
- We would go dancing
in Harlem. (chuckles)

12:19.489 --> 12:23.493
♪ Don't need your help and
your tight and old rules ♪

12:23.660 --> 12:27.038
-  It was always
very, very, very eclectic.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.206
-  Now!

12:29.291 --> 12:31.084
-  But the
'60s in general

12:31.251 --> 12:34.504
were a political, moral,
social revolution.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.259
- Halston understood
that there was

12:39.426 --> 12:42.429
a whole new social
order coming in.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.598
The war baby boom came of age.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.434
Drugs, sex, and rock and roll.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.395
Even the French
couture changed.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.397
St. Laurent,
Givenchy, and Cardin

12:52.564 --> 12:54.900
opened up ready-to-wear
boutiques.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.277
And so, Halston saw
all of that in Paris,

12:57.444 --> 13:01.198
and there was tension
with the Bergdorf people.

13:17.255 --> 13:21.176
- Halston came to see me,
and he said, "I have backing.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.137
"Would you clean up your act?"

13:24.304 --> 13:26.097
I was deep into
drugs by that time.

13:26.264 --> 13:29.768
But I did stop
intravenous drugs

13:29.935 --> 13:32.229
and went to work with him.

13:32.395 --> 13:36.650
♪ This the house that
Jack built, y'all ♪

13:36.816 --> 13:40.237
♪ Remember this house ♪

13:40.403 --> 13:43.240
♪ This was the land
the he worked by hand ♪

13:43.406 --> 13:45.867
- Well, the salon was on
68th Street and Madison,

13:46.034 --> 13:50.247
in this little, tiny walk-up
kind of derelict building.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.958
Compared to Bergdorf Goodman,
I thought, like, you know,

13:53.124 --> 13:55.794
wow, this is, like,
didn't feel so fancy.

13:55.961 --> 13:59.381
Then you went upstairs, a
plain door, and you'd knock,

13:59.548 --> 14:01.007
and then you'd go in,
it was just magic.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.886
♪ What is the use of crying ♪

14:05.053 --> 14:06.888
- Basically, it was just
a floor-through apartment

14:07.055 --> 14:09.349
that they turned into this
incredible background,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.768
which is all just sort
of magical and exotic,

14:11.935 --> 14:13.520
and you felt like you
were in an Indian palace

14:13.687 --> 14:14.771
or you didn't know
where you were.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.398
You're on safari.

14:16.565 --> 14:17.899
It was very wild.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.276
And I remember the furniture,

14:19.442 --> 14:20.402
because it was
very uncomfortable.

14:20.569 --> 14:21.903
It was horn furniture.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.405
Like you sat in them,

14:23.572 --> 14:24.322
and you just didn't
want to sit in them,

14:24.489 --> 14:26.491

atmosphere very democratic.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.085
I mean, I'm a poor kid
from Long Island City.

14:37.252 --> 14:41.798
But then there was Marisa
Berenson and Berry,

14:41.965 --> 14:43.550
who grew up in Paris.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.761
- It was a mix of
social circles.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.389
And that's what was so
great about that era,

14:49.556 --> 14:52.350
is that it was a big
mix of interesting,

14:52.517 --> 14:55.604
fascinating people.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.938
Like Elsa.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.024
- I love to be
with homosexuals.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.736
I stay 15 years with
homosexuals, and I loved them.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.572
Because I didn't
have the lover.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.365
(clapperboard snapping)

15:07.532 --> 15:08.742
-  Pat Cleveland was
discovered on a subway car.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.036
- I was still in high school.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.371
I went into the room, and
he looked at me and he said,

15:13.538 --> 15:17.459
"Okay, you'll be here
tomorrow for the show."

15:17.626 --> 15:20.045
-  He was
totally laser-focused

15:20.211 --> 15:21.755
on this collection

15:21.921 --> 15:26.343
because, in his mind, I'm
sure this was make or break.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.053
- All the ladies of
society were there.

15:28.219 --> 15:31.014
The Vogue ladies were
sitting in the front row.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.850
Oh, my goodness, this is
it, we're doing this show.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.769
And he lined us girls up.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.270
We were all perfectly dressed.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.105
And he would go
to the first girl,

15:39.272 --> 15:41.316
and he'd whisper
something into their ear.

15:41.483 --> 15:44.611
And he'd say, "Now, don't
forget, you're the best."

15:55.997 --> 15:59.334
♪ And what costume shall

15:59.501 --> 16:02.045

16:14.974 --> 16:16.434
- Overnight success.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.561
It was a clean look.

16:18.728 --> 16:23.817
The simplicity was really
needed after the '60s.

16:23.983 --> 16:28.071
And it was all-American,
from an all-American boy.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.618
(audience applauding)

16:33.785 --> 16:35.078

16:47.757 --> 16:49.467
Panel, this is Mr. X,

16:49.634 --> 16:52.387

And now let's show our

and what his product is.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.271

17:03.064 --> 17:06.276
- Can I rule out that
your name is Valentino?

17:06.443 --> 17:08.194
- You can rule that out.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.988
- All right, no, no, I'm sure
if I hear the name, I'll know.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.698
It's because I don't
recognize you on site.

17:11.865 --> 17:16.327
But would the clothing be
the new sensation hot pants?

17:16.493 --> 17:17.412
- That's it!
- Yes.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.371
-  Is that right?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.247
(audience applauding)

17:19.414 --> 17:22.791
(mysterious music)

17:27.797 --> 17:30.550
- Felt like the beginning
because he was so enthusiastic,

17:30.717 --> 17:34.429
and everybody was so charmed
with him, and so young,

17:34.596 --> 17:36.014
and it was enticing.

17:36.181 --> 17:39.058
You just wanted to be
in the room with him.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.436
- I was 18.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.021
I was so innocent.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.314
I knew nothing.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.318
I was from the Midwest.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.612
Everyone was unusual for me.

17:50.779 --> 17:51.863
Like Pat Ast.

Andy kept saying, "Oh,

18:15.303 --> 18:16.304
"this is so in, Bob.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.680
"This is so in."

18:19.641 --> 18:22.018
He knew Halston from the 1950s,

18:22.185 --> 18:26.481
when Andy was doing ads
and windows for Bergdorf's.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.775
He was comfortable in

18:43.081 --> 18:44.457
(interviewer laughing)

18:44.624 --> 18:47.043
-  Joe was not
only the illustrator,

18:47.210 --> 18:48.837
but a close friend.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.799
You know, Halston was very
cool, and Joe was very hot.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.762
-  He was drawn to people

18:57.929 --> 19:00.557
who just displayed
their emotions.

19:00.723 --> 19:04.352
And also, have this
tremendous aesthetic side.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.609
- And he believed so
much on me, Halston.

19:11.776 --> 19:15.071
- Elsa would be there
drawing things all the time.

19:15.238 --> 19:18.491
And Halston said, "You need
to be a jewelry designer."

19:18.658 --> 19:21.494
And somehow she made this
jewelry for us, which is,

19:21.661 --> 19:24.747
I had two of these,
one was stolen.

19:24.914 --> 19:25.832
- Why I did do jewelry?

19:25.999 --> 19:28.459
I just was trapped into it.

19:28.626 --> 19:32.589
I did something for fun,
it became a success.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.424
-  Really?

19:35.592 --> 19:36.551
- We were hipsters.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.094
We thought we were.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.264
We probably weren't
at all, but, you know.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.017
My husband, Bill, was
starting to work at Halston's.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.561
They got along
really well together.

19:46.728 --> 19:49.022
In the beginning, he
couldn't wait to go to work.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.983
And that's a great
feeling, isn't it?

19:53.151 --> 19:56.112
-  Bill Dugan
was the first disciple.

19:56.279 --> 20:00.408
And 12 years later, he was
still spreading the gospel.

20:00.575 --> 20:03.536
- If you want to understand
Halston's clothes,

20:03.703 --> 20:06.164
you have to understand
the lineage first.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.917
You see, when he
did his first line,

20:09.083 --> 20:10.418
I think he was the
first to be surprised

20:10.585 --> 20:13.379
at how good he really was.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.967
The other who was surprised,
of course, was his mentor.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.808
- Oh, I think perhaps
Charles James,

20:25.975 --> 20:27.602
who was a friend of mine.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.896
(dramatic music)

20:30.063 --> 20:31.439
(audience applauding)

20:31.606 --> 20:33.274
- Charles James is
such an amazing figure.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.692
Difficult, controversial.

20:34.859 --> 20:35.818
But he's one of
these people that,

20:35.985 --> 20:37.487

20:54.629 --> 20:58.383
♪ You'll be saying
the same thing ♪

20:58.549 --> 21:00.134
- He mimicked Charles.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.594
Charles would say things like,

21:01.761 --> 21:04.263
"You're only as good
as who you dress."

21:04.430 --> 21:06.099
And suddenly
Halston was saying,

21:06.265 --> 21:09.185
"You're only as good
as who you dress."

21:10.311 --> 21:12.271
♪ I've asked so
many questions ♪

21:12.438 --> 21:14.190
- In the late '60s,

21:14.357 --> 21:17.527
Charles James was really out
of his luck, and he owed money.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.612
And he really wasn't designing.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.698
♪ Find all the answers ♪

21:21.864 --> 21:23.074
- It's true that you're
considering going on welfare,

21:23.241 --> 21:24.575
isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.452
In order to get my
doctor's bills paid.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.578
It's just the most shocking--

21:27.745 --> 21:29.163
-  Halston felt for him.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.916
♪ There'll be
days to remember ♪

21:32.083 --> 21:33.626
-  So he
hired Charles James

21:33.793 --> 21:36.254
to help him with a collection.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.734
(gentle piano music)

21:57.900 --> 22:01.154
- James's working
methodology was overworking

22:01.320 --> 22:03.614
and overworking the same idea,

22:03.781 --> 22:06.826
and creating things that were
so incredibly complicated

22:06.993 --> 22:09.203
that it simply wasn't viable.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.001
-  Charles was furious
throughout the whole thing

22:15.168 --> 22:16.669
'cause it wasn't right.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.256
Charles wanted control,
Halston wanted control.

22:20.423 --> 22:24.343
It was almost like father
and rebellious son.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.470
It was a disaster, by the way.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.180
The collection was a disaster.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.681
- The few pieces that I've seen

22:28.848 --> 22:30.933
look a little
tortured, frankly.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.727
Very typical of James's work,

22:32.894 --> 22:35.104
where he would take fabric
and twist it and torque it.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.690
And in the end result, you had
things that looked amazing,

22:37.857 --> 22:40.318
in a way, but
somehow unwearable.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.781
- Halston said, "Well, I
just want you to know that,

22:44.947 --> 22:47.158
"you know, I'm locking
Charles out of the workroom."

22:52.371 --> 22:55.249
- Halston is a
middle-of-the-road man,

22:55.416 --> 23:00.630
who would be better as a buyer
in a store, or a stylist.

23:02.006 --> 23:07.470
He knows how to select
good things to copy.

23:07.637 --> 23:11.808
But his passion has been
to put his name on it.

23:11.974 --> 23:18.147
For which action, the word
plagiarism is correct.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.444
- Halston didn't copy.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.030
Eventually, I went
to work for Halston,

23:26.197 --> 23:32.161
and I saw that Halston took
concepts of Charles James

23:32.328 --> 23:33.663
and relaxed them.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.210
His clothes were
for a modern time.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.504
For a time where
women's lifestyle

23:41.671 --> 23:43.256
had changed completely.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.382
I mean, he understood that.

23:44.549 --> 23:47.176
(ethereal music)

23:50.805 --> 23:52.348
- Elegance and ease.

23:54.308 --> 23:58.896
A sense of owning power,
without being masculine.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.984
And honoring the
body that you have.

24:04.819 --> 24:08.197
Basically, you were
usually naked underneath.

24:08.364 --> 24:11.075
- You were free
inside your clothes.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.206
- He took away the cage.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.749
And he made things

24:18.916 --> 24:21.836
as though you didn't
really need the structure

24:22.003 --> 24:24.589
as much as you
needed the woman.

24:24.755 --> 24:29.177
He really based most of his
collection on most of us girls.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.845
- I think maybe we just had
a pin there to hold it up,

24:31.012 --> 24:32.013
it might be good, huh?

24:32.180 --> 24:33.514
- Mm-hmm.

24:33.681 --> 24:36.142
- Let's see you turn
in it, Chrissy, huh?

24:36.309 --> 24:40.354
- Fabric to Halston was
like clay to a sculptor.

24:40.521 --> 24:43.024
He knew how to use it.

24:43.191 --> 24:47.528
And everything was cut on
the bias, so it spiraled.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.197
-  Basically,
bias is cutting fabric

24:49.363 --> 24:52.241
on an oblique, or
45-degree angle.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.577
Fabric is usually cut
on the straight grain.

24:54.744 --> 24:55.828
If you've ever cut
something on the bias,

24:55.995 --> 24:57.788
it flows over the body.

24:57.955 --> 25:00.458
It opens up, if you will.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.376
- It's very hard to do it.

25:02.543 --> 25:03.794
Nothing is straight.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.839
It's very hard to
sew, everything moves.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.842
Especially on chiffon,
it's very hard to control.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.678
But he made it so easy.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.348
- He just would throw a
piece of fabric on the floor,

25:15.514 --> 25:17.266
and cut through it.

25:17.433 --> 25:21.520
Pick it up, throw it on you,
and then, pfft, it was a dress.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.106
- That's genius.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.400
It's a dress.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.736
Just from the way he cut it.

25:28.903 --> 25:30.571
I don't know anybody
who could do that.

25:30.738 --> 25:31.948
He's the only one.

25:55.596 --> 25:58.724
- That's probably the
largest Halston collection

25:58.891 --> 26:02.019
of all the museums
in the States.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.437
When I started working here,

26:03.604 --> 26:05.564
I started really
looking at the clothes.

26:05.731 --> 26:09.860
And I'm most fascinated with
the single-seam patterns.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.656
Similar to the one
that's up there,

26:13.823 --> 26:15.157
which looks like a painting,

26:15.324 --> 26:17.994
is actually the
pattern for that dress.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.329
It's really hard
to see it, flat.

26:20.496 --> 26:24.125
But, and just spirals.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.210
And this is another one

26:26.377 --> 26:29.880
that is cut from one
piece of fabric, folded.

26:30.047 --> 26:34.510
You cut out the neck, and the
seam goes from here to here,

26:34.677 --> 26:36.846
down the side, and then across.

26:37.013 --> 26:38.973
It's one piece of fabric.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.017
The pattern looks like
a Cuisinart blade.

26:41.183 --> 26:44.520
(ethereal music)

26:44.687 --> 26:47.189
Very much like the art, at
the time, like abstract art.

26:47.356 --> 26:51.736
It was reducing it down to
its least common denominators.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.366
- I think if fashion
history would write it,

26:57.533 --> 26:59.660
I'd like to have a
credit point of saying

26:59.827 --> 27:01.954
maybe we cleaned it up
a bit, where, you know,

27:02.121 --> 27:04.165
I have a theory that less
becomes more, so much.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.041
- Uh-huh.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.086
-  I felt more
intimidated by Halston

27:09.253 --> 27:12.423
than by whatever man
I met in my life.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.008
-  Because?

27:14.175 --> 27:16.552
- Because everything
he was doing was great.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.387
Every time, every time.

27:19.764 --> 27:21.057
He astonished me.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.768
-  How do
you feel when you, say,

27:23.934 --> 27:25.519
walk into a restaurant in
New York, and a lady comes in

27:25.686 --> 27:28.022
looking smashing in
a Halston outfit?

27:28.189 --> 27:30.691
- I'm very proud.

27:30.858 --> 27:34.570
I'm just very proud if somebody
looks good in it, you know?

27:34.737 --> 27:35.654
-  What
if she comes in

27:35.821 --> 27:38.032
and doesn't look good in it?

27:38.199 --> 27:41.410
- Then I'm not so
proud. (laughing)

27:41.577 --> 27:42.578
(vibrant music)

27:42.745 --> 27:44.163
-  The Halston market

27:44.330 --> 27:45.915
is in the better stores
across the country.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.458
In New York, it's
Bergdorf Goodman,

27:47.625 --> 27:49.293
where he has a boutique

27:49.460 --> 27:52.046
in the same spot he started
selling hats to rich ladies

27:52.213 --> 27:53.839
15 years ago.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.925
This is Halston off the rack.

27:56.092 --> 27:57.510
The favorite item?

27:57.676 --> 28:00.429
An Ultrasuede shirt dress
with a $200 price tag

28:00.596 --> 28:03.808
that has broken all
previous sales records.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.435
- You're late.

28:06.602 --> 28:07.895
My god, are you ever
on time, come on.

28:08.062 --> 28:09.814
-  But for
real extravagance,

28:09.980 --> 28:12.233
the ladies come to Halston's
own showroom on Madison Avenue,

28:12.400 --> 28:14.735
where super saleswoman Pat Ast

28:14.902 --> 28:17.655
will give them that
special treatment.

28:17.822 --> 28:19.240
-  What
about Pat Ast?

28:19.407 --> 28:21.367
Some people have suggested
that by using her,

28:21.534 --> 28:24.370
you're putting
down fashion a bit.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.997
- Well, if you think
that Patty is a put-down,

28:27.164 --> 28:28.124
but I don't think so.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.209
I take her very seriously.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.087
And I like to make
her glamorous.

28:33.254 --> 28:36.132
- Halston designs things that
are made especially for me,

28:36.298 --> 28:39.135
which is the most incredible
thing, 'cause looking at me,

28:39.301 --> 28:42.304
you know I'm not the
normal size woman.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.516
- I think he appreciated
the woman's body.

28:45.683 --> 28:48.978
I think he appreciated all
the different types of women.

28:49.145 --> 28:52.064
He loved all of the
diversity of his models.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.899
- If you take this down, Iman.
- Yeah.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.610
- And you turn around, that
way so you see a decollete.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.904
This is Iman's first show.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.656
She's never been in a
fashion show before.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.617
How do you feel about your
first fashion show, Iman?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.161
- I'm very nervous.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.668
- He always loved
different personalities.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.336
And he encouraged that.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.046
- Do you think that models
are some of the sexy,

29:16.213 --> 29:17.631
most beautiful
girls in the world?

29:17.798 --> 29:19.300
- Sometimes.

29:19.467 --> 29:20.426
- Do you think they should
all be in the movies?

29:20.593 --> 29:22.261
- No.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.556
-  He also loved the
idea of being controversial.

29:25.723 --> 29:27.391
I remember the Coty Award Show,

29:27.558 --> 29:31.770
he decided it was gonna be a
happening, so anything goes.

29:31.937 --> 29:32.897
-  Tell me something.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.565
-  I'm gonna tell you.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.358
I hope that show goes
better than the rehearsal.

29:36.525 --> 29:40.446
- All the fashion world is
waiting for the Coty Awards.

29:40.613 --> 29:41.906
-  The audience
in the Coty Awards

29:42.072 --> 29:44.158
tend to be a
little more formal.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.203
But Halston wanted to
be very irreverent.

29:47.369 --> 29:50.247
- Andy and Halston
came up with this idea

29:50.414 --> 29:54.585
that it was like a talent
show, Halston's Talent Hour.

29:56.879 --> 30:01.550
("When the Saints
Go Marching In")

30:01.717 --> 30:03.469
I played the clarinet.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.555
He said, "What can
you do?" (laughing)

30:06.722 --> 30:08.390
"What else can you do?"

30:11.852 --> 30:13.896
♪ Oh yeah ♪

30:15.397 --> 30:18.067
- The audience, they didn't
know what to make of it.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.945
(chuckles)

30:21.111 --> 30:23.155
Halston wanted it to be,
just throw everything in,

30:23.322 --> 30:24.907
including the kitchen sink.

30:25.074 --> 30:29.245
And by the way, have Pat come
out of the birthday cake.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.958
♪ Ah ah ah ah ah ♪

30:34.124 --> 30:38.295
♪ Happy birthday to me ♪

30:38.462 --> 30:42.758
♪ Happy birthday to me ♪

30:42.925 --> 30:46.762
♪ Happy birthday,
happy birthday ♪

30:47.888 --> 30:51.392
(gentle instrumental music)

30:55.104 --> 30:58.274
- He took a chance, a leap
of faith to be something

30:58.440 --> 31:02.152
that maybe a lot of people
think they can't do.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.493
He would say, "You can
have anything you want.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.079
"You're a good person."

31:12.246 --> 31:14.582
You know, that feeling that
somebody believes in you.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.208
You know?

31:16.375 --> 31:20.004
And because of that, you
know, he made me stronger.

31:22.673 --> 31:25.217
(chuckling)

31:25.384 --> 31:30.472
Waterproof. (chuckling)

31:35.644 --> 31:39.106
I remember one time we
went out West to do a show,

31:39.273 --> 31:41.150
and Halston said, "I
want you to come with me.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.611
I wanna see something."

31:43.777 --> 31:45.529
He rented a car.

31:45.696 --> 31:49.199
And you never saw him drive
'cause we'd always be in limos.

31:49.366 --> 31:53.245
And we went way out in the
middle of nowhere, out there.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.955
Not a lot to look
at. (chuckles)

31:55.122 --> 31:56.165
Sky and earth.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.254
And he said, "That's
where I grew up.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.256
"This is where I grew up."

32:04.423 --> 32:05.883
And we'd be in the
middle of nowhere.

32:06.050 --> 32:09.345
Just, like, farms, with
the big rolls of hay.

32:09.511 --> 32:14.350
He said, "I just wanted
to come by here."

32:19.480 --> 32:22.858
- I only lived in Iowa for
about five minutes, you know.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.069
I mean, I moved out of
Iowa as a young man.

32:25.235 --> 32:26.737
It was during the
Second World War,

32:26.904 --> 32:28.155
and my father was in a business

32:28.322 --> 32:30.282
that took us from
one place to another,

32:30.449 --> 32:31.992
so I lived in the
Lake of the Ozarks,

32:32.159 --> 32:34.995
and I lived in Kentucky,
and I lived in Missouri,

32:35.162 --> 32:37.623
and then we finally
settled in Indiana.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.083
So I was all over, you know.

32:39.249 --> 32:42.044
It was sort of an
unsettled time.

32:42.211 --> 32:44.380
-  When
you do go back home--

32:44.546 --> 32:46.882
- There is no home
in Iowa, you see?

32:47.049 --> 32:48.967
What else do you think
we should go over?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.761
-  Just a
little bit of the history.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.638
I think that would be good
for us to have and so forth.

32:52.805 --> 32:54.640
- Oh, let's not go into the
whole history crap, you know.

32:54.807 --> 32:55.974
What about right now?

32:56.141 --> 32:57.559
-  But
this is history.

32:57.726 --> 33:00.437
- The past just doesn't
interest me so much.

33:00.604 --> 33:04.274
I think you have pretty much,
I think you have enough.

33:04.441 --> 33:05.818
-  And
we need a transcript

33:05.984 --> 33:07.444
as soon as possible.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.782
(jazz noir music)

33:42.938 --> 33:44.565
- His mother would
come and visit,

33:44.732 --> 33:47.401
and she always
called him Hahl-ston.

33:48.861 --> 33:52.322
And he had changed the
pronunciation to Hall-ston,

33:52.489 --> 33:54.366
but she would correct you.

33:54.533 --> 33:58.454
"His name is Hahl-ston,
it's a family name."

33:58.620 --> 34:02.249
She also used to say
Hahl-ston had disappeared,

34:03.459 --> 34:07.296
but Hall-ston was a force
to be reckoned with.

34:12.384 --> 34:16.346
And this is the manager
of the boutique.

34:16.513 --> 34:19.891
Ed was just as
handsome as Halston.

34:20.058 --> 34:25.063
And had just as much charisma.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.029
-  Ed Austin.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.405
(phone line beeps)

34:33.572 --> 34:35.282
-  Never mentioned his dad,

34:35.449 --> 34:38.702
but he called his mom every
week, every Monday afternoon.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.579
Hallie Mae.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.456
I'm being careful
about what I'm saying.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.751
I don't know how much
you know about me.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.962
- I didn't know it at
the time, but apparently,

34:49.129 --> 34:52.549
Halston and Ed had had
a relationship earlier.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.177
(thunder rumbling)

34:55.344 --> 34:56.762
- I was kept hidden.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.889
I still don't know why.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.350
I would go to his
house at night.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.018
The doorman would
stop me and say,

35:03.185 --> 35:06.522
"The deliveries go in the
back," that sort of thing.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.235
We had a wonderful
relationship.

35:11.401 --> 35:15.697
He used to call me the crown
prince, and he was the king.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.033
-  When did it end?

35:19.827 --> 35:22.162
-  One Christmas,

35:22.329 --> 35:25.707
Ed had done this absolutely
beautiful window.

35:27.376 --> 35:32.422
And that was the day that
Victor Hugo took over.

35:47.104 --> 35:48.355
-  Victor came down

35:48.522 --> 35:51.066
and started to
rearrange Ed's window.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.072
It was very asymmetrical,
and very haphazard.

35:58.991 --> 36:01.869
But Halston came and
loved the window.

36:03.412 --> 36:08.292
When Ed saw it, he just put
on his coat and went home.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.961
It was the changing
of the guard.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.464
- Are you looking
for his Rosebud?

36:14.631 --> 36:17.009
The one thing that
explains his whole life?

36:17.175 --> 36:18.343
You won't find one.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.012
Not with Halston.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.806
What you see is
what you get, baby.

36:25.726 --> 36:27.394
- Victor was Venezuelan,

36:27.561 --> 36:31.481
and he was a bad boy who
got into a lot of trouble.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.236
- My theory has
always been that

36:36.403 --> 36:39.281
Halston came from
an alcoholic family.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.911
That his father had a problem.

36:44.077 --> 36:47.873
And that Halston recreated
his family life with Victor

36:48.040 --> 36:50.375
as the dysfunctional person

36:50.542 --> 36:55.505
who is constantly going to
keep everything off balance.

36:55.672 --> 36:59.009
(upbeat music)

37:24.201 --> 37:26.495
- He'd do the
pregnancy, Patty Hearst.

37:26.662 --> 37:27.871
I mean, really crazy.

37:28.038 --> 37:31.875
But this was his
personality, extreme.

37:58.986 --> 38:00.570
-  Roy, I found
these pictures of us

38:00.737 --> 38:05.867
in my mom's attic.

38:10.956 --> 38:14.793
Darling H, you love
life and I love you.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.255
-  Ladies and
gentlemen, Liza Minnelli.

38:18.422 --> 38:23.051
(epic music)
(audience applauding)

38:23.760 --> 38:25.137
- When I met Halston,

38:25.303 --> 38:27.639
I just remember him
talking and me listening.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.391
(camera shutter clicks)

38:29.558 --> 38:31.810
He'd say, "I got it, all
right," and just put it on you.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.062
And it danced with
you, that's it.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.773
His clothes danced with you.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.191
(camera shutter clicks)

38:38.358 --> 38:40.402
We were joined at
the hip from then on.

38:40.569 --> 38:41.778
He was like my dad, in a way,

38:41.945 --> 38:44.322
because when I
was a little girl,

38:44.489 --> 38:48.744
my father would give me
five costumes every year.

38:48.910 --> 38:53.081
And it was a dress from
An American In Paris.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.918
And perfectly made, exactly
like for the ladies.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.797
And I guess I got
into appreciating

39:01.882 --> 39:05.135
how clothes could
change the way you felt.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.930
- She dressed only
in Halston, ever.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.515
I mean, she still does.

39:10.682 --> 39:11.933
- Yes.
(audience applauding)

39:12.100 --> 39:13.310
- Liza Minnelli.

39:13.477 --> 39:15.645
(audience cheering
and applauding)

39:15.812 --> 39:18.940
♪ Say yes ♪

39:19.107 --> 39:22.611
♪ Life keeps
happening every day ♪

39:22.778 --> 39:24.654
- And this is Halston,
who is, I think, today,

39:24.821 --> 39:26.281
wouldn't you say,
the best-known name,

39:26.448 --> 39:27.699
no, you shouldn't
say best and worst

39:27.866 --> 39:29.451
'cause then other
designers get upset.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.119
You're pretty good, Halston.
- Thank you.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.704
(all laughing)

39:32.871 --> 39:34.956
♪ You'll never win

39:35.123 --> 39:38.627

marigold right outside ♪

39:42.172 --> 39:43.465

39:43.632 --> 39:45.383

39:49.012 --> 39:50.180

39:50.347 --> 39:51.973
-  Every single week,

he was having meetings with
Revlon's Sol Levine, Coty.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.187
- A Mr. Bannon of IFF,

39:57.354 --> 40:00.107
he'd like to meet with
you today if possible.

40:00.273 --> 40:03.777
-  And then
finally, Max Factor.

40:03.944 --> 40:07.280
And Max Factor was a
subsidiary of Norton Simon.

40:07.447 --> 40:11.535
♪ Say yes ♪

40:11.701 --> 40:13.078
♪ Yes, I can ♪

40:13.245 --> 40:15.872
- I remember Halston
saying to Andy and me,

40:16.039 --> 40:18.875
"You know, I really like
the Norton Simon people

40:19.042 --> 40:21.336
"because they're all so tall."

40:25.298 --> 40:28.135
David Mahoney was the
chairman of Norton Simon.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.595
And he was tall, good-looking,

40:30.762 --> 40:32.848
and you know, a lot of glamour.

40:33.014 --> 40:36.518

but there's lots of wheat ♪

40:46.236 --> 40:49.156
♪ Say yes ♪

40:49.322 --> 40:50.949
-  It seemed
like a good match.

40:51.116 --> 40:55.120
If he was bought in
total under Norton Simon,

40:55.287 --> 40:58.039
he'd have the freedom to
explore and to develop more

40:58.206 --> 41:00.041
of what Halston wanted.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.084

41:01.251 --> 41:03.920
♪ Yes, I'll fly ♪

41:14.222 --> 41:18.894

(audience applauding)

41:19.811 --> 41:22.731
(gentle piano music)

41:26.026 --> 41:28.445
- At the time, it
seemed like a huge coup.

41:28.612 --> 41:31.198
And all his friends, I mean,
including Andy and all of us,

41:31.364 --> 41:33.241
were very happy for him.

41:33.408 --> 41:37.370
- He told me, "Gino,
we're gonna be very busy

41:37.537 --> 41:41.833
"because I'm gonna design
furniture, car interiors.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.878
"I'm gonna design a carpet."

41:45.045 --> 41:46.963
- Well, don't you find that if
you take on that many things,

41:47.130 --> 41:49.216
that one of your projects
is going to suffer?

41:49.382 --> 41:50.926
- It's rather like
growing a tree.

41:51.092 --> 41:52.302
You know, everyone thinks
you're an overnight success.

41:52.469 --> 41:54.429
I've worked very
hard for 20 years.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.723
And, you know, it's just
a further extension of it,

41:56.890 --> 41:58.266
it's another branch.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.728
And they all help each
other, in a curious way.

42:03.855 --> 42:07.067
-  Was this
the beginning of the end?

42:07.234 --> 42:08.944
Or was it just the beginning?

42:09.110 --> 42:11.613
(vibrant music)

42:14.658 --> 42:18.078
- In 1973, five
American designers

42:18.245 --> 42:19.913
and five French designers

42:20.080 --> 42:23.792
were showing their collections
at one time, at one place,

42:23.959 --> 42:26.002
the Palace of Versailles.

42:28.463 --> 42:31.132
- American designers
had never been invited

42:31.299 --> 42:32.550
to show in Paris.

42:34.094 --> 42:36.471
And this was a huge, huge deal.

42:40.517 --> 42:41.851
-  For Halston,
it was very important.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.312
He'd go as far as he
had to go to get it

42:44.479 --> 42:47.357
to be the best he
thought he could make it.

42:47.524 --> 42:50.860
- He realized that you
need a star in there.

42:52.529 --> 42:55.991
What happened was that
Halston got David Mahoney

42:56.157 --> 43:00.036
to sponsor the trip,
and David loved it.

43:00.203 --> 43:01.788
He fit right in there.

43:01.955 --> 43:06.042
(gentle instrumental music)

43:06.209 --> 43:07.752
- David Mahoney seemed to me

43:07.919 --> 43:10.297
to be fairly
ambitious socially.

43:10.463 --> 43:12.924
And like so many
self-made people,

43:13.091 --> 43:17.595
they wanted to be part of
this kinda cafe society.

43:22.642 --> 43:25.395
- It was a very
competitive evening.

43:28.023 --> 43:30.233
- I think the designers
were having difficulty

43:30.400 --> 43:32.193
with each other.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.488
The French took up all the
time for the rehearsal,

43:35.655 --> 43:37.574
and we were the addendums.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.243
It was rude, actually.

43:41.494 --> 43:44.873
- Their whole presentation
was beyond grand.

43:46.416 --> 43:47.751
They changed orchestras

43:47.917 --> 43:51.046
for each of the different
designer segments.

43:51.212 --> 43:52.756
-  We couldn't rehearse.

43:52.922 --> 43:55.258
All of us were
waiting and waiting.

43:55.425 --> 43:57.427
It was cold, damp.

43:57.594 --> 44:00.722
Unfortunately with
Halston, it got to him.

44:00.889 --> 44:02.724
- A terrible fight
seems to break out.

44:02.891 --> 44:06.811
I heard some very
vicious things were said.

44:06.978 --> 44:09.856
- He did have a
blowup, very dramatic.

44:10.940 --> 44:13.610
- It was very difficult.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.445
Halston left, and
Liza said, you know,

44:15.612 --> 44:17.906
"We've got to get
this show done."

44:18.073 --> 44:20.367
-  She's the one
who sat down with Halston.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.202
She unified everybody.

44:23.995 --> 44:27.082
- We'd open, and I'd
sing Bonjour Paris.

44:28.249 --> 44:31.461
♪ I wanna step out down
the Champs-Elysee ♪

44:31.628 --> 44:34.798
♪ From the Arch of Triumph
to the Petit Palais ♪

44:34.964 --> 44:37.425
♪ That's for me ♪

44:37.592 --> 44:40.678
♪ Bonjour, Paris ♪
- Bonjour, Paris!

44:40.845 --> 44:41.930
So.

44:42.097 --> 44:44.891
(upbeat music)

44:45.058 --> 44:46.434
Let's get started.

44:46.601 --> 44:47.769
And we were off.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.817
-  It was
directed like a musical.

44:53.983 --> 44:57.237
- Liza said, "Look, it
doesn't wanna look rehearsed.

44:57.404 --> 45:00.323
"The more human,
the more goofed up,

45:00.490 --> 45:03.118
"that's gonna
make this happen."

45:04.577 --> 45:06.996
- We were so wild,
in comparison.

45:07.163 --> 45:10.208
We had 12
African-American girls.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.668
They only had one.

45:16.381 --> 45:20.718
- No sets, it was just
straightforward fashion,

45:20.885 --> 45:24.973
in your face, and modern.

45:29.978 --> 45:33.398
- All of that energy and
that joy and that wonder

45:33.565 --> 45:35.275
and that curiosity.

45:35.442 --> 45:36.734
Well, that is America.

45:36.901 --> 45:39.404
(audience applauding)

45:39.571 --> 45:41.823
At the end of Halston's piece,

45:43.241 --> 45:46.202
they threw their
programs up in the air.

45:46.369 --> 45:47.620
They went bananas.

45:48.997 --> 45:52.584
- Versailles put American
fashion on the map.

45:52.750 --> 45:53.501
On the map.

45:55.211 --> 45:58.131
-  Halston was at
the top of his game.

45:58.298 --> 46:01.384
He came like a king
of the Americans.

46:01.551 --> 46:04.012
- Versailles was an extension

46:04.179 --> 46:07.182
of what he felt he could
achieve going down the road

46:07.348 --> 46:09.184
because of Norton Simon.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.105
When he came back, the
whole thing changed.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.774
His first real
office by himself

46:16.941 --> 46:20.278
was all lined with
mirrors, all along.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.864
It was like, totally mirrored.

46:23.031 --> 46:26.201
Very modern and very
slick and minimal.

46:26.367 --> 46:30.371
You can see his changing
of his whole almost psyche.

46:32.332 --> 46:35.460
The hair started getting
cut less bohemian,

46:35.627 --> 46:38.213
more crisp and clean,
opened his face.

46:38.379 --> 46:40.256
The white shirt, the tie.

46:41.591 --> 46:42.926
He's very in control.

46:43.092 --> 46:45.011
He's very, he is Halston.

46:46.387 --> 46:48.097
He is Halston, you know?

46:48.264 --> 46:49.807
And it was like, wow!

46:51.476 --> 46:54.145
(slow jazz music)

46:57.982 --> 47:00.485
- I'm Halston, and
this is my home.

47:02.779 --> 47:05.073
The architect was Paul Rudolph.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.992
And the day I saw
it, I bought it.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.869
It's the only real modern house

47:10.036 --> 47:12.539
built in the City of New York
since the Second World War.

47:12.705 --> 47:15.458
It's like living in a
three-dimensional sculpture.

47:15.625 --> 47:18.169
- When I was hired
by Norton Simon,

47:18.336 --> 47:20.088
of course I had
to meet Halston.

47:20.255 --> 47:22.882
So I went to his townhouse.

47:23.049 --> 47:24.759
And he showed me
through the whole thing,

47:24.926 --> 47:27.345
and he was clearly
delighted with his new toy.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.305
And I was terribly impressed.

47:29.472 --> 47:30.932
And I remember saying to him,

47:31.099 --> 47:32.892
I'm gonna enjoy making
money for you, Halston,

47:33.059 --> 47:35.478
'cause you know
how to spend it.

47:36.896 --> 47:39.148
My brief was that,
whatever else you do,

47:39.315 --> 47:42.777
you've got to get the
fragrance underway.

47:42.944 --> 47:45.947
He wanted Elsa to
design the bottle.

47:46.114 --> 47:47.532
- Elsa Peretti would come in.

47:47.699 --> 47:50.493
He wanted it to be sort
of a teardrop shape,

47:50.660 --> 47:53.204
like her iconic necklaces.

47:53.371 --> 47:57.333
And they went through
a number of iterations.

47:57.500 --> 48:00.420
- I design not thinking
about the deadline.

48:00.587 --> 48:03.798
You know how much time it
take me to do this glass?

48:03.965 --> 48:05.466
-  - No.

48:05.633 --> 48:07.176
- From '74 up to now.

48:08.469 --> 48:10.513
And they're still not good.

48:10.680 --> 48:13.641
(ethereal music)

48:13.808 --> 48:16.477
-  No one had
ever seen a bottle like that.

48:16.644 --> 48:18.354
It had a curved neck.

48:18.521 --> 48:20.106
Max Factor people hated it.

48:20.273 --> 48:21.691
- Production people at Max
Factor called me and said,

48:21.858 --> 48:24.527
"You know what this
nut is doing now?

48:24.694 --> 48:27.155
"He's putting out a bottle
that looks like a glob.

48:27.322 --> 48:29.157
"You can't fill
it from the top.

48:29.324 --> 48:31.451
"It won't work."

48:31.618 --> 48:33.244
-  They had
to get a special stopper.

48:33.411 --> 48:35.330
They were talking about
the economics of it.

48:35.496 --> 48:36.998
-  I don't think
Halston really cared

48:37.165 --> 48:38.499
what they thought.

48:38.666 --> 48:41.377
(machinery whirring)

48:43.004 --> 48:44.756
- It is my name attached to it,

48:44.922 --> 48:47.008
so I want to live with
this for a long time.

48:47.175 --> 48:51.054
Just the bottle alone is a
revolutionary new concept.

48:51.220 --> 48:52.639
- Then I got
another phone call.

48:52.805 --> 48:54.432
It said, "You also
realize what he's doing?

48:54.599 --> 48:58.269
"He's not even putting
his name on it."

48:58.436 --> 49:00.313
- Because he thought
it was a work of art.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.733
And simplicity was the keynote.

49:03.900 --> 49:05.109
So his name was on the ribbon

49:05.276 --> 49:07.153
with which the bottle
itself was tied.

49:07.320 --> 49:11.115
No one else had done
it that way before.

49:11.282 --> 49:13.743
And then the
fragrance caught on.

49:14.827 --> 49:16.454
It became a seller.

49:16.621 --> 49:18.623
(exciting music)

49:18.790 --> 49:21.793
The largest American
designer fragrance.

49:21.959 --> 49:24.045
The stores couldn't
get it fast enough.

49:24.212 --> 49:25.380
It was ballistic.

49:25.546 --> 49:26.964
- You'd get into a
taxi in New York,

49:27.131 --> 49:28.466
and the taxi driver would say,

49:28.633 --> 49:31.886
"Oh, you smell good,
you're wearing Halston."

49:34.305 --> 49:38.059
Once it started to go,
everything started to go.

49:40.395 --> 49:43.022
-  I began a
very large license program.

49:43.189 --> 49:45.108
We were the first
American designer

49:45.274 --> 49:48.486
to really do this heavy.

49:48.653 --> 49:52.115
- I have two fragrances
for men, a tie licensee,

49:52.281 --> 49:53.616
two suede sport jackets.

49:53.783 --> 49:56.911
We have an entire
cosmetic line.

49:57.078 --> 49:58.162
My name is Halston.

49:58.329 --> 49:59.706
I'm Halston.

49:59.872 --> 50:01.249
-  You've got
luggage, you've got--

50:01.416 --> 50:03.000
-  Rugs, sheets,
perfume, cosmetics.

50:03.167 --> 50:04.377
-  Really?

50:04.544 --> 50:05.336
- Shoes, bags,
gloves, sunglasses,

50:05.503 --> 50:07.171
all kinds of things.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.673
- Holy cow, you wouldn't have
20 till payday, would you?

50:08.840 --> 50:11.092
I'm a little short.
(audience laughing)

50:11.259 --> 50:13.469
-  The United
States of America.

50:13.636 --> 50:17.598
-  He designed the
uniform for the '76 Olympics.

50:17.765 --> 50:19.851
- He designed the new Girl
Scout Uniform for leaders,

50:20.017 --> 50:22.395
so we don't have to wear the
drab-looking things we used to.

50:22.562 --> 50:23.646
Thank you.
- Thank you very much,

50:23.813 --> 50:26.274
you know.
(audience applauding)

50:26.441 --> 50:27.942
-  And you
also dressed the Avis--

50:28.109 --> 50:30.069
- Well, the whole Avis Company.

50:30.236 --> 50:31.195
No, I do a lot of
things like that.

50:31.362 --> 50:32.739
-  When do you sleep?

50:32.905 --> 50:34.407
- Oh, well, I sleep.
(audience applauding)

50:34.574 --> 50:36.117
- I would call that
the golden years.

50:36.284 --> 50:38.786
What he touched turned to gold.

50:40.246 --> 50:43.875
He set up the deal for
Elsa to go with Tiffany.

50:44.041 --> 50:48.337
- Halston took me there, and
there I was, with Tiffany.

50:48.504 --> 50:50.465
-  That's it,
that's it, that's all, please.

50:50.631 --> 50:51.591
-  He made
the wedding clothes

50:51.758 --> 50:53.468
for Sly and the Family Stone.

50:55.178 --> 50:56.304
-  He designed

50:56.471 --> 50:57.972
all the costumes
for Martha Graham,

50:58.139 --> 51:00.308
and then supported the company.

51:00.475 --> 51:02.894
(dramatic music)

51:03.060 --> 51:05.605
- He had a lot of
things on his plate.

51:05.772 --> 51:10.318
And I have a feeling that
is where some of the tension

51:10.485 --> 51:11.819
started to happen.

51:14.447 --> 51:16.449
-  Halston
felt that he, individually,

51:16.616 --> 51:18.910
had to design everything
that was licensed,

51:19.076 --> 51:21.412
and that was a monumental task.

51:23.456 --> 51:24.999
- I must be a part of it.

51:25.166 --> 51:27.794
I never, ever just lent my name

51:27.960 --> 51:30.546
for a commercial
business venture.

51:32.507 --> 51:35.510
- From the first
day I got there,

51:35.676 --> 51:38.763
one of the things that I
did every couple of weeks

51:38.930 --> 51:42.141
was go to the bank and
take out a ton of cash

51:42.308 --> 51:45.394
and bring it back
in an envelope.

51:45.561 --> 51:47.188
He'd say, "I might
be in a meeting,

51:47.355 --> 51:50.942
but if Mr. Fisher comes,

51:51.108 --> 51:53.319
"just give him the envelope."

51:56.364 --> 51:59.575
I never saw him snort
cocaine, but I paid,

52:01.410 --> 52:04.664
I mean, I got a lot of
money every few weeks.

52:04.831 --> 52:06.040
$2,000 to $3,000.

52:07.291 --> 52:09.252
- I want to stop all
the kind of bullshit

52:09.418 --> 52:10.753
that we were drug addicts.

52:10.920 --> 52:13.214
We'd smoke, yeah, but we work.

52:14.549 --> 52:17.051
For that our things were going.

52:17.218 --> 52:18.845
For that Halston thing.

52:19.011 --> 52:20.179
What do you think,
with Halston,

52:20.346 --> 52:22.390
we were
there and smoking?

52:22.557 --> 52:26.352
No, we were thinking,
what you wear, what you do

52:26.519 --> 52:28.271
all night long.

52:28.437 --> 52:31.148
I was working all night long.

52:31.315 --> 52:35.069
Yeah, we took drugs
(snorts) of course.

52:35.236 --> 52:39.657
How you cannot take drugs,
being up all night long?

52:39.824 --> 52:41.367
But it was smoking.

52:41.534 --> 52:44.036
It was not heavy drugs.

52:44.203 --> 52:45.955
A little coke sometimes.

52:47.957 --> 52:49.542
- Halston took me
into his office one day,

52:49.709 --> 52:50.835
and he just said,
"You know,

52:51.002 --> 52:52.336
I want somebody
who is completely

52:52.503 --> 52:54.380
committed to the business."

52:58.551 --> 53:01.137
- I went to work for Halston.

53:01.304 --> 53:03.180
The best thing I ever did.

53:04.557 --> 53:07.560
I was totally, 1,000%
devoted to him.

53:07.727 --> 53:10.521
I remember going in
to set up my office.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.023
It would start to rain.

53:12.189 --> 53:13.858
And when I got off
the elevator,

53:14.025 --> 53:15.568
Halston was standing there.

53:15.735 --> 53:19.447
He looked at me, and he
said, "You're all wet."

53:19.614 --> 53:22.491
He was carrying a red
raincoat, and he said,

53:22.658 --> 53:24.201
"I want you to try this on.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.746
"I made this for Liza, but
I want you to have it."

53:26.913 --> 53:29.540
(jazz noir music)

53:31.292 --> 53:33.127
He was such a hard worker.

53:33.294 --> 53:35.087
I mean, he'd come in
early, go home late,

53:35.254 --> 53:37.757
and always
accomplish something.

53:37.924 --> 53:39.133
Until Studio 54.

53:41.469 --> 53:44.138

54:00.488 --> 54:02.740
- I took Halston to Studio 54.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.909
So I don't know what
other stories you heard,

54:05.076 --> 54:07.203
but I remember that was the
first time, and he says,

54:07.370 --> 54:09.330
"I'm gonna bring friends."

54:14.001 --> 54:17.672
- Halston gave a birthday
party for Bianca Jagger,

54:17.838 --> 54:19.215
and Bianca got on the horse,

54:19.382 --> 54:22.718
and that photograph
went around the world.

54:22.885 --> 54:27.139
And that made 54 like the
place where everybody went.

54:27.306 --> 54:31.310
(camera shutter clicking)

54:31.477 --> 54:33.479
-  You're a
devotee of Studio 54.

54:33.646 --> 54:35.022
What do you see there?

54:35.189 --> 54:36.732
- As Truman said, it's
the only democracy.

54:36.899 --> 54:40.152
It's good for everybody
on every level of society.

54:40.319 --> 54:41.696
-  This is the scene

54:41.862 --> 54:44.156
outside a New York
disco called Studio 54.

54:44.323 --> 54:47.284
This is the place that's
in with the disco crowd,

54:47.451 --> 54:51.372
except that these
people are still out.

54:51.539 --> 54:53.165
Of course, Liza Minnelli
and her kind of celebrities

54:53.332 --> 54:54.875
sweep right through
the protective ranks

54:55.042 --> 54:58.295
of doorkeepers.

54:58.462 --> 55:00.548
- They are discriminating
at Studio 54.

55:00.715 --> 55:03.217
Recently, a president of a
Wall Street brokerage firm

55:03.384 --> 55:05.261
was ejected, and
he was a member.

55:05.428 --> 55:08.264
So he's suing for a million.

55:08.431 --> 55:09.557
- I'll do a Donna Summer song.

55:09.724 --> 55:11.225
Ah. (laughing)

55:11.392 --> 55:13.728
(disco music)

55:16.981 --> 55:19.775
-  I think they lived
out a lot of their fantasies.

55:19.942 --> 55:22.611
As gay boys, Hollywood
was such a big influence

55:22.778 --> 55:25.156
on both Andy and Halston.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.824
- I was born in the Midwest.

55:26.991 --> 55:30.411
And, you know, much of your
life was really probably

55:30.578 --> 55:35.541
involved in going to the movies
on Saturdays and Sundays.

55:35.708 --> 55:37.043
-  If you
were at a dinner party

55:37.209 --> 55:38.544
and you could have
one person on the left

55:38.711 --> 55:40.379
and one on the right,
who would that be?

55:40.546 --> 55:41.839
- Halston and Elizabeth Taylor.

55:42.006 --> 55:42.965
-  Why?

55:43.132 --> 55:45.718
- Oh, they're both wonderful.

55:45.885 --> 55:47.094
-  They weren't society,

55:47.261 --> 55:49.638
but they became a
new kind of society.

55:52.016 --> 55:54.435
Suddenly, you know, gays
were part of society.

55:54.602 --> 55:57.271
Many more Jews were
part of society.

56:00.399 --> 56:02.109
- He wasn't a snob.

56:02.276 --> 56:03.903
Halston wasn't a snob.

56:04.070 --> 56:05.780
He wasn't uppity.

56:05.946 --> 56:07.281
He wasn't anything.

56:07.448 --> 56:09.075
- Both you and Halston
come from Indiana.

56:09.241 --> 56:11.452
You sound like Cary Grant,
you sound like Noel Coward.

56:11.619 --> 56:13.287
(both laughing)

56:13.454 --> 56:15.039
You moved the accent.

56:15.206 --> 56:16.582
Were you unhappy at some point
with where you came from,

56:16.749 --> 56:18.584
and decided, I'm
going to show them?

56:18.751 --> 56:20.086
- Never.

56:20.252 --> 56:21.420
Never.

56:21.587 --> 56:22.797
I wasn't, anyway.

56:26.383 --> 56:29.345
- Well, everybody was
free love, and free this,

56:29.512 --> 56:33.140
and poppers and coke
and this and that.

56:38.187 --> 56:42.233
It got very muddy, and
it's like quicksand.

56:43.609 --> 56:46.779
If everybody around
you is going down,

56:46.946 --> 56:48.864
you're gonna go too.

56:52.743 --> 56:55.496
- Victor was a
destructive force.

56:55.663 --> 56:58.374
Andy did Victor's portraits,
I think he did two.

56:58.541 --> 57:00.292
And one day, Victor shows up

57:00.459 --> 57:02.837
with the paintings completely
covered with graffiti,

57:03.003 --> 57:04.171
and just a mess.

57:06.507 --> 57:09.051
And he had painted over them,

57:09.218 --> 57:13.514
thinking this was like taking
Andy's art to another level.

57:13.681 --> 57:15.307
And Andy was really mad.

57:15.474 --> 57:16.809
And Andy was like,

57:16.976 --> 57:18.519
"Don't think I'm doing
new ones, Victor."

57:32.116 --> 57:34.535
(upbeat music)

57:36.036 --> 57:40.833
- Company was booming, so I
went out looking for space.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.753
And I came upon this
thing in Olympic Tower,

57:44.920 --> 57:46.463
and that was the
end of the search,

57:46.630 --> 57:51.010
because Halston, "That's
the one we're gonna get."

57:51.177 --> 57:52.636
The architect came
up with some plans,

57:52.803 --> 57:54.555
and Halston didn't like them.

57:54.722 --> 57:58.017
He wanted something that took
spectacular use of the space.

57:58.184 --> 58:01.562
And he began to
design what he wanted.

58:17.578 --> 58:19.413
Mirrors everywhere.

58:19.580 --> 58:20.623
The walls were mirrors.

58:20.789 --> 58:23.334
Everything was mirrors.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.002
Except my office.

58:25.169 --> 58:26.921
I wouldn't allow them to
put up mirrors in my office.

58:27.087 --> 58:28.964
I didn't wanna look
at myself all day.

58:32.218 --> 58:35.596
- Halston made sure
that his entire workroom

58:35.763 --> 58:38.849
were in a room with
a lot of windows,

58:39.016 --> 58:42.519
so that as they sewed
and fitted every day,

58:42.686 --> 58:44.813
they didn't feel confined.

58:44.980 --> 58:47.066
That really impressed me.

58:47.233 --> 58:51.070
- When the workmen saw
the space, the women wept.

58:52.529 --> 58:55.032
- That was the best
workroom in the world.

58:55.199 --> 58:57.743
Was even too good
to be a workroom.

58:57.910 --> 59:00.412
(upbeat music)

59:13.634 --> 59:16.762
- There wasn't, at the time,
I don't think there is today,

59:16.929 --> 59:20.808
a fashion house ever
as grand as that was.

59:25.771 --> 59:30.359
(camera shutter clicking)

59:35.281 --> 59:36.907
- In that space,

59:37.074 --> 59:39.785
he had reached something
very specific to him.

59:39.952 --> 59:42.288
That's where he
felt he belonged.

59:42.454 --> 59:44.498
♪ I'm in with the in crowd ♪

59:44.665 --> 59:47.001

59:50.045 --> 59:52.965

glamorous in New York.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.724

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:20.075
- I made it in New York.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:23.704
- But then, of course,
it became ginormous.

01:00:25.331 --> 01:00:26.749
- And what he did was

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.292
he surrounded himself

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:30.919

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.315
Is it gonna be some fashion
designer standing by himself?

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:55.319

Okay, where are the--

Fairchild is the publisher

of Women's Wear.

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:14.088
As always, he has

Women's Wear is the

- Halston, if they
stand on the table,

01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:25.015
will it hurt the table?

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.433
- It would, 'cause I
just had 'em lacquered.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.143
- No, no, no.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.520
Can they stand on the
table with their bare feet?

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.779
-  Leave the candles.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:01.760
-  Everybody at the
Olympic Tower called him H.

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:02.928
And they'd say, "H?"

01:02:03.095 --> 01:02:05.389
And he'd say, "I
am the emperor."

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.977
And he was believing
this stuff.

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:11.603
-  Halston, is
it tougher to get on top,

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.063
or to stay on top?

01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:17.151
- Halston said, "Let me tell
you, we're going to China."

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:18.152
I'm like, wow.

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:21.738
-  China
wanted to show the world

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.907
that they were opening up.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.493
So they invited the
master of publicity

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.537
to visit the silk cities.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.875
- Come on, D.D.,
come on, everybody.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:36.503
What I want to explain to
you all is what we're doing.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:41.383
- With the China trip, you
could see the brain working.

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:46.054
Each girl had their own
personal collection designed.

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:48.307
Everything, all laid out.

01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:51.351
- We just needed to pack
our lingerie and makeup.

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:53.312
- We will also go
to the Ming tombs,

01:02:53.479 --> 01:02:55.647
and we'll go to
the Forbidden City.

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.691
And one of the best places
is going to be, of course,

01:02:57.858 --> 01:03:00.027
the Great Wall of China.

01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:02.988
- Every affair, you know,
dinner here, dinner there.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:04.656
Everything was choreographed.

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.241
It was just incredible.

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.660
- If it's a cold day,
she'll wear, you know,

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:11.580
sort of a shawl like this,
but this is a Chinatex silk.

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:13.707
-  He just
had total control.

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:15.167
- Hi, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.

01:03:15.334 --> 01:03:16.585
-  Come on in

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:18.462
and get photographed,
Andy. (chuckling)

01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:22.716
- He asked me one day, "Do you
dream of what you're doing?"

01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:25.886
And, obviously, I was exhausted
from going to Studio 54

01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:27.471
and all those parties,
and I was like,

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.014
no, I haven't dreamt of it.

01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:31.725
He's like, "You know,
Naeem, it'll be amazing.

01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:33.936
"You'll be a great designer
when you start dreaming.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:35.729
"It should come to
you in the night,

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:37.940
"then you know that you
are thinking about it."

01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:41.527
- Naeem, why don't you show
Andy, put the lights on,

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.570
and make 'em sparkle
over there, huh?

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.405
Those are your things.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:49.993
-  So to him, night
and day, it was there.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.079
- You see, this is
only part of them.

01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:54.790
We've got another about
15 people, 'cause all--

01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:56.416
- There must have
been about 30 people.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.210
And I was coordinating it.

01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:01.463
There was 100 pieces
of Hartmann luggage.

01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:04.841
- We were going to China.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.677
Who got invited to China?

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.387
(models cheering and laughing)

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:09.930
(upbeat music)

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.521
- I said to a
Chinese executive,

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.231
we're coming with
a lot of luggage.

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:20.148
Do you have a way
of handling it?

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:21.316
He said, "Oh, yes, yes."

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:24.027
And he came with
a shopping cart.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:28.824
They had one shopping cart to
move our luggage. (laughing)

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:35.455
- This is the beginning of
the world tour of fashions

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:36.999
by Halston.

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:37.791
-  I think
there's a big change.

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:39.376
-  Why?

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:42.087
- Well, I think it's
America's time, really.

01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:47.509
-  Here he is,

01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:50.095
sort of an ambassador
of American fashion.

01:04:50.262 --> 01:04:53.223
He became somewhat
like a world figure.

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:55.017
(camera shutter clicks)

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:09.573
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.868
(camera shutter clicking)

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:19.458
- But we were basically there
to go to the silk factories.

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:23.295
- Those people who
had done the fabrics

01:05:23.462 --> 01:05:26.548
actually got to see how you
could play with the fabric.

01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:29.885
So they were just,
like, in awe.

01:05:30.052 --> 01:05:31.511
It was wonderful.

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:34.681
I was in awe of them
being in awe of us.

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:37.100
-  That's great.
(woman laughing)

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.645
That's great, I
love that on you.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.104
I love that on you.
(crowd applauding)

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.439
-  It might
be a little tight,

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.983
but I consider it
a great compliment

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.527
that she wanted to put it on.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.488
-  Halston was saying,
"No, they wanna modernize.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.073
"They wanna modernize here."

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:53.241
- Is it that complicated
to change the patterns?

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.869
- I think that made
the trip for Halston.

01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:58.997
Because I think he thought
he could contribute something

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:03.710
to the people of China.
(camera shutter clicking)

01:06:04.503 --> 01:06:05.879
- That was really PR.

01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:08.465
And he got tremendous
amount of publicity.

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:10.175
He was all over.

01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:12.135
And when you see the
pictures, they were beautiful.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.554
I mean, they looked fantastic.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:17.224
You know, if you didn't know
the back side of the story,

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:20.394
it looked like a
fantastic trip.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.854
Halston and the group here,
Halston and the group there.

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:24.439
They all looked great.

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:26.274
You know, half of them
are really miserable,

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:29.236
but they all looked
terrific. (laughing)

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.081
(audio screeching)

01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:47.379
- Oh, I'm staying.

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:49.548
It's exhausting, and
I'm just starting.

01:06:49.715 --> 01:06:53.218
- We had a film crew
following us the whole time.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:59.558
-  Every day was
directed by Halston.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:02.060
- Get out of the camera way.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:03.395
The cameras are here,
so you can't be here,

01:07:03.562 --> 01:07:04.563
you have to be on
the other side.

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.440
- He just wanted total control.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:09.443
And it was too much,
it became too much.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:13.113
- I want you all stand
up there, on the runway.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.531
Not in twos and twos.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:15.574
You're doing it
like a fashion show.

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:17.617
It looks so dumb.

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.619
Go out again.

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:21.496
No, not please, just do it.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:23.540
- He was a perfectionist.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:26.710
He had a very rough
time in giving up.

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:29.087
It was an emotional,
like, lock-in.

01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:30.297
- No, nothing's lined up.

01:07:30.464 --> 01:07:31.173
Connie?

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:35.969
Can't you people line it
up like I've lined it up?

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:37.095
I mean, really.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.597
Look at the boards.

01:07:38.764 --> 01:07:39.973
It's so dumb.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.100
What do you think
I did all this for?

01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:43.852
Well, I hope nobody
has to go tonight

01:07:44.019 --> 01:07:46.813
because we've got
to go through this.

01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:49.775
- He was a bit of a bully.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:52.444
You really had to stand up to
him, otherwise, you'd be lost.

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:54.696
And there wasn't a lot of
people who could do that.

01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:57.657
Very, very few people
in our company.

01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:01.161
- He would snap at you.

01:08:01.328 --> 01:08:05.165
And even though we all had
the same amount of abuse,

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.376
you took it personally.

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:11.713
I never, ever got used
to being yelled at.

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:16.384
- It just became a
different relationship

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.345
and a different company.

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:26.185
- Even with Faye, I mean,
she defended that man.

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:28.438
But he'd just take
it all out on her.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:32.776
Scream and yell at the
top of his lungs, I mean.

01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:33.984
- Come on, come on, D. D.

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:35.319
Come on, everybody.

01:08:35.487 --> 01:08:37.697
Don't walk out like
you're a parade.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:41.701
- But the aura of it all,
and being a part of it,

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.036
kept you hooked.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.580
You know, eventually,

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:48.917
he had all of us wear
black at the office.

01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:53.712
He wanted us to be a
backdrop to the clothes.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:59.135
And everything, to
him, was a PR event.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.804
We were all PR events.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:07.143
It was the stage
set that was us.

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:09.145
-  Margaret.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.064
(Margaret laughing)

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:13.358
-  What we're looking
for is the illusion of art.

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:14.693
- Can I give you a little
bit of highlight there?

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:16.069
That's very good.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:21.992
- You see, our mistake,
including Halston,

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.743
is to take our
name too seriously.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:27.872
I mean, for me.

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.916
I was a jewelry designer.

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.877
I was a good jewelry designer.

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:35.462
I dedicate all my time to it.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:03.700
- We had fights because he was
so much out of it, you know.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:05.577
Because I'm vulgar.

01:10:05.744 --> 01:10:07.621
Not vulgar, but, you know, I
cannot withstand all the time,

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:11.458
thinking that the pencil has
to be like that, impossible.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:12.292
(clapperboard snapping)

01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:30.810
(ominous music)

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:42.322
- He became a real loner.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.204
-  And did you
see the Elizabeth cover?

01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:50.789
- Oh, it's so--
- Oh, that's beautiful.

01:10:50.956 --> 01:10:52.290
- Isn't that wonderful?
- I love it for her.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:53.833
- She looks great.
- She looks really great.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.377
-  I love the
picture of her inside.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:56.336
-  It's good.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.507
-  Oh, it looks great.

01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:02.092
- Do you like that?
- Mm-hmm, I love it.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.843
-  Yeah, I think
Elizabeth will like that.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.595
-  Color is fabulous.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:07.722
Fabulous, it looks
good, uh-huh.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:11.351
- With the cover of Harper's
Bazaar, I just love it on her.

01:11:11.518 --> 01:11:12.602
-  And the truth
of the matter is

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.604
that his business
was slowing down.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:18.024
He peaked, and other
names were showing up.

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:21.194
- Which brings us to Calvins,

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.697
and the survival
of the fittest.

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.449
- Good morning, Calvin
Klein, I presume.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:28.034
Is that your name?

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:34.499
-  Perry Ellis
is a new name in fashion.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:43.925
-  But Halston was
never one to fall behind.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.681
- I am pleased to
announce an association

01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:53.143
between Halston
Enterprises and JCPenney.

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:57.564
Today, we have signed $1
billion retail sales agreement.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:00.233
- It was a license
over five years.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.695
The largest designer deal
that had ever been made.

01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:05.780
Enough money to make
anyone, even Norton Simon,

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:07.657
sit up and take notice.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:12.328
- I begged him, I begged him
not to do the Penney thing.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:14.205
This is gonna kill us.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:16.207
And he kept saying,
"No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:19.002
"I wanna dress
everybody in America."

01:12:21.046 --> 01:12:22.756
- It sounded like
a good deal to me,

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:26.593
to create things for people
who couldn't afford his, yes.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.219
- Well, you know,
strangely enough,

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:30.388
when I was a kid, I always
shopped at Penney's.

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:33.141
My mother always took me to
Penney's to buy all the clothes

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:35.018
that we wore to school
and everything else.

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:37.353
And it's true, I come
from Des Moines, Iowa.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.564
And my mother being a
practical Midwestern lady,

01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:41.483
always took us there.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:44.360
- In one highly-publicized
stroke of the pen,

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:47.030
Halston moved from
class to mass.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:48.615
The reaction of
the fashion world

01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:50.950
ranged from shock to outrage.

01:12:52.202 --> 01:12:53.703
-  JCPenney?

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.163
-  Yes, JCPenney,

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:57.290
that nationwide
middle-class retailer

01:12:57.457 --> 01:12:59.375
that offers clothes
right off the rack,

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.920
has landed a very big designer.

01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:02.962
-  Would you
expect to find a designer

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.547
like Halston in here?

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.133
- No, not Halston in JCPenney.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.718
- Obviously, we're
very excited about it.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:11.221
We think it is a catch.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:13.473
- JCPenney is
trying to trade up.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.266
But they're not quite
gonna change their name

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:17.477
to JCPeigner or JCPeignoir.

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:20.814
- I believe in our country,
and I like America,

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.273
and I like Americans
to look good.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.691
And I'm an American designer,

01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:25.318
and I love the
opportunity to do it.

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.112
- It's a first

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:28.822
between a department store
chain and a major designer,

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:30.657
with the clothes expected
to be on the racks

01:13:30.824 --> 01:13:32.534
in the fall of '83.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.537
- That makes a very good mix
from both catalog and retail.

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:37.622
-  This
is called Halston III.

01:13:37.789 --> 01:13:39.457
- It's called Halston III.
- Why?

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:42.460
- Well, it's really the
third stage of my career.

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:44.170
The first being in the
millinery business,

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:45.713
and then in fancy clothes

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.298
and dressing all the
stars and things.

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:51.928
And now, a larger public,
dressing America, really.

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:52.971
-  He said
he would design it,

01:13:53.138 --> 01:13:54.556
and he designed it.

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:56.599
And everybody, of course,
wanted a piece of it.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:14:00.478
You know, the guy who made
scarves wanted Halston scarves.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.355
The guy who made shoes
wanted Halston shoes.

01:14:02.522 --> 01:14:04.524
All that was going on.

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:08.361
- JCPenney is an
organization that is so vast,

01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:10.905
it's not like one person
oversees the whole thing.

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:15.076
And so, talk about cultures,
different cultures completely.

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:17.662
- We asked Penney executives
to sum up the Halston III line

01:14:17.829 --> 01:14:19.247
in one word.

01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:20.039
- Profit.

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:21.082
- Volume.

01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:23.209
- It's what America wants.

01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:27.922
-  Things
became so tense

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.841
that Norton Simon
brought in consultants

01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:34.053
to fix the relationship.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.518
-  When I got
involved in it and everything,

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.354
I thought, oh, boy, we're
really in for it, Billie.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.773
I mean, shit, this
is a mother lode.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.401
These people really need help.

01:14:48.568 --> 01:14:50.486
Some sketches they
couldn't read.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.114
Fabrics they didn't
know anything about.

01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:54.782
Everybody would pat me
on the head and say,

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:57.785
"Oh, listen, just leave it
to us, we'll work it out.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.162
"You just be artistical."

01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:00.747
(woman laughing)

01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:03.124
Well, no, no way.

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:05.710
The only way it'll work, let
me tell you, listen to daddy.

01:15:05.877 --> 01:15:07.086
-  Yes, I'm listening.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:08.129
-  The only
way it'll work is

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:09.589
to make the goddamn dress,

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:11.174
which, we're making
the goddamn dress.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.009
And then they go and look
at the goddamn dress,

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:14.761
they'll see the
point of difference.

01:15:14.928 --> 01:15:16.304
I'm just trying
to make it work.

01:15:16.471 --> 01:15:17.722
-  I know that.

01:15:17.889 --> 01:15:20.058
I know that, it was--
- Desperately.

01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:25.355
-  All the plants,
he's got to understand

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.565
that we've got to commit,
like, eight months in advance.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:29.275
We need to get the
approvals and the go-aheads

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:30.610
and the concepts.

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:32.528
But he's so involved
with everything,

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:34.280
that everything take,

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:37.450
on the label, the
label took him months.

01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:40.954
(vibrant electronic music)

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:45.166
- America has heard about it.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:48.044
And we've all dreamt about it.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:52.006
And now, after months of
anticipation, it's here.

01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:56.678
The Halston III
Collection for 1983.

01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:01.391
- This is an
experiment, you know?

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.977
And it could succeed,
it could not succeed.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.771
(exciting music)

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:12.902
- Quite a show.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:16.364
500 of the fashionables
sat in a huge room,

01:16:16.531 --> 01:16:20.326
dominated by a 60-foot whale
hanging down from the ceiling.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:24.247
People didn't know where to
cry bravo or thar she blows.

01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:28.293
- This has been probably the
most challenging and gratifying

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:30.712
fashion exercise in my career.

01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:36.301
- He did really
give a lot to it.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.261
I mean, he was really
taking it seriously.

01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:41.139
He did a really
well-conceived line.

01:16:42.682 --> 01:16:45.518
- Gosh, we had about
26 models in there.

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:46.853
The clothes looked spectacular.

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.604
It was perfect
for that audience.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:52.608
And everybody looked fabulous,
and very good reviews.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:56.154
And the show was very
successful, very.

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:58.823
(audience applauding)

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:00.241
- I'm telling him how
great his show was.

01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:01.617
And I knew he was behind it.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.202
- I love your
board of directors,

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.663
wanting to go out and buy
it right away. (laughing)

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.165
That's great.

01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:08.458
- Well, we'll have a
lot more great showings.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.625
-  You
know, I think so.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:10.960
- It's the first
of many to come.

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:12.170
- No, I'm very proud of it.

01:17:12.337 --> 01:17:13.129
It's wonderful, a
wonderful thing.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:18.217
(audience applauding)

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:24.557
- They had a big flag
out at the museum

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:26.434
when they had the show.

01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:29.354
And Ira Neimark, who was the
President of Bergdorf-Goodman,

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.397
and Jackie, his wife, were
coming home from dinner,

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:33.483
and they saw this Halston flag.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.568
He called his
senior merchandising

01:17:35.735 --> 01:17:36.903
manager that night

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:41.074
at home, and she
called me at home

01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:45.036
and said he wants
everything out of the store.

01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:46.537
The fragrance, the
ready-to-wear, everything.

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:48.581
He doesn't want anything
to do with Halston.

01:17:48.748 --> 01:17:51.125
(ominous music)

01:17:52.794 --> 01:17:54.712
- Didn't you run into some
trouble with Bergdorf,

01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:55.713
who was the first place
you had a boutique?

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.215
- Oh, not at all.

01:17:57.382 --> 01:17:58.883
No, I don't think so.

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:00.593
You know, Bergdorf, you
know, I wish them well.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.512
I started my career at Bergdorf

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.514
and helped to make
Bergdorf famous.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.099
But Bergdorf is a
rather small account

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.143
compared to all America.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.645
- He was very upset.

01:18:10.812 --> 01:18:12.397
He didn't understand it.

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:15.441
Also, shocked
over the fact that

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:17.110
that could happen that quickly.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.653
- Did Bergdorf-Goodman
drop your line

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:21.406
because you went to Penney's?

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.449
- They, I think,
felt threatened.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.993
But I think there's
a way out of it.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.371
- Your connection to
Bergdorf is a very important,

01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:29.455
in terms of, wasn't that
the first to give you--

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:31.457
- I helped to make Bergdorf.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:33.042
- He stepped out of the norm.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:37.213
And people like
their boundaries

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.800
that are set between
them and those.

01:18:40.967 --> 01:18:43.511
- The fancy-shmancy
guys are saying

01:18:43.678 --> 01:18:47.598
that undermines your
elegant, chic hoi polloi.

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:48.933
- Oh, it doesn't.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.601
My business is very good.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:52.353
You know, if one store more
or less doesn't like it,

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.647
I mean, you know, I'm sorry.

01:18:54.814 --> 01:18:56.774
- Yeah, but you can't--
- I tried my best.

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:59.235
- And then I started
getting all kinds of calls

01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:02.488
from presidents of the stores
all over the United States,

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:06.534
and merchandising managers,
cutting back on orders.

01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:11.289
It was pure hell after that.

01:19:11.456 --> 01:19:14.876
He realized that he had
done the wrong thing.

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:19.881
- You know, the
press could be mean.

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:22.133
They were not supporting him.

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:23.968
That seemed odd to me.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.847
It just seemed like a gang.

01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:29.515
One person misbehaves,

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:33.186
and then everybody's
bullying this one person.

01:19:35.563 --> 01:19:38.858
- Clearly, the purpose was to
strengthen Penney's position

01:19:39.025 --> 01:19:41.819
as a supplier of
fashionable merchandise.

01:19:41.986 --> 01:19:43.446
-  Good.

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:45.072
-  Okay, fine, that's
a diplomatic answer.

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:46.157
- I guess you got
what you need.

01:19:46.324 --> 01:19:47.325
-  Oh, absolutely.

01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:48.784
- You can cut out and chop away

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.703
and do what you need, okay.
- Oh, no--

01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:55.666
- The JCPenney thing became
so enormous a problem,

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:59.378
that the distance between
us became too great.

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:02.507
He wanted me to leave,

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:04.383
but he didn't want to say
he wanted me to leave.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:08.804
He wanted to make things so
unpleasant that I would leave.

01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:12.642
I pushed him too hard.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:15.728
I pushed too many
licenses down on him.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.733
(dramatic music)

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:27.156
- Things got out of control,
and I started not to feel well.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.700
So I went to the
doctor, and he said,

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:32.036
"You have the
beginning of an ulcer."

01:20:32.203 --> 01:20:36.374
And it was from the stress.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:45.049
I just got to the point where
I couldn't deal with it.

01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:46.551
And had to leave.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:47.927
I hated to leave.

01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:52.974
I loved Halston, but
I had to get out.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.690
- I saw him
frustrated, and like,

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.485
"How can this thing
come into my life?"

01:21:04.652 --> 01:21:08.281
And I said, well, maybe you
have to drop the whole thing

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:12.118
and come with me,
and get outta here.

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:15.538
We'll just get a boat,
you'll take a break.

01:21:17.582 --> 01:21:23.462
And he'd say, "I
can't go." (sniffles)

01:21:28.593 --> 01:21:31.178
-  They say that
when it rains, it pours.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:33.889
Well, a perfect storm
was about to happen

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:36.183
when his good
friend David Mahoney

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.686
threw him into the
belly of the whale.

01:21:38.853 --> 01:21:42.565
(audio screeching)

01:21:42.732 --> 01:21:45.067
-  The day
before the JCPenney show,

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.903
David made an offer
to buy Norton Simon.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.239
(gentle instrumental music)

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:52.450
He was gonna take it private,

01:21:52.617 --> 01:21:56.037
and he could make an awful
lot of money doing that.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:57.788
- Takeover mania in America.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:00.041
Huge corporations are
gobbling one another

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:02.501
at a rate unmatched in history.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:04.545
-  But Esmark
came along out of the blue.

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:06.213
(bell ringing)

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.466
They made an outside bid
that was better than David's

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.009
and won the battle.

01:22:13.888 --> 01:22:15.139
- I don't know
how Halston felt,

01:22:15.306 --> 01:22:17.224
because after Norton
Simon sold him,

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.810
David Mahoney was,
you know, not there.

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:22.396
- You cannot
expect other people

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:24.649
to be interested in your
welfare all the time.

01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:27.026
It's unfair, and
it's illogical.

01:22:27.193 --> 01:22:28.819
So therefore, you'd better
take care of your own instincts

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:30.196
and your own efforts.

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:31.489
- Dog eat dog, look
out for yourself,

01:22:31.656 --> 01:22:33.324
or is that what you mean?

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:34.617
- Well, no, I really
don't mean that,

01:22:34.784 --> 01:22:37.078
although that's
part of it, Jane.

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:38.663
- You know how business is.

01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:40.998
You know how money is,
you know how that is.

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:43.376
It's the pollution in the air.

01:22:45.086 --> 01:22:48.381
-  Esmark wasn't
really in the fashion business.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.174
Except for maybe.

01:22:50.341 --> 01:22:53.135
-  Feeling smashing,
or the height of fashion?

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:55.388
Playtex once and you'll
Playtex for keeps.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:57.098
For comfort to please you.

01:22:57.264 --> 01:23:00.267
-  So Halston
was put under Joel Smilow,

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:02.019
one of America's
toughest bosses,

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:04.522
according to Fortune Magazine.

01:23:04.689 --> 01:23:06.982
- This is a little
teeny company.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.318
You know, sort of a flyspeck.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:11.362
And so, think of it,

01:23:11.529 --> 01:23:15.408
if supposing you owned
the New York Yankees,

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:18.577
and you also owned a
class D farm's team

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:22.748
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:24.333
How much time would you spend

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.585
with your Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania farm team?

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:31.757
(jazz noir music)

01:23:36.762 --> 01:23:40.933
- In 1983, my uncle asked
me to come to dinner

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.727
while I was here.

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:46.313
I had recently
graduated from college.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.065
I was very green.

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:49.900
And he dropped the bomb on me.

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:52.695
He said, "Well, would
you like to work for me?"

01:23:52.862 --> 01:23:56.741
And I just sort of did
a somersault and said,

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.075
okay, I would love
to work for you.

01:23:58.242 --> 01:23:59.452
When do I start?

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:04.498
I think maybe he wanted to
bring in a family member

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.667
who he could trust 100%.

01:24:08.419 --> 01:24:10.629
There was a new manager
there from Esmark

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:12.298
who had just come on.

01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:16.844
Do I have to say
his name? (chuckles)

01:24:17.011 --> 01:24:17.511
-  You don't
wanna say his name?

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:18.429
- No.

01:24:18.596 --> 01:24:21.390
(jazz noir music)

01:24:45.623 --> 01:24:49.585
- My first day at
Halston was interesting.

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:52.588
I never seen anything
quite like it.

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:55.382
Here, I'm the kid
from Brooklyn, right?

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:59.178
Yet got into this
world of Halston's

01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:01.514
castle, Olympic Tower.

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:10.064
Look, Ma, I'm on television.

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:11.941
-  It's about time.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:16.070
- There was a kind of a pinkie
throw, everywhere you went.

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:22.326
Halston was a little bit
Hollywood, in my parlance.

01:25:23.828 --> 01:25:26.288
But I thought we hit it off.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:29.250
(guests chattering)

01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:35.548
- You'd never think Carl
ever be with Halston.

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:39.176
I mean, physically,
mentally, anything.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:42.972
But when Carl came in,
in a very strange way,

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:45.641
Halston liked him a lot.

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:47.184
- He kept saying,

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:49.603
"I've never had the
right kind of management.

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.981
"And that's part
of our problem."

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.441
And he gives me a
kiss on the forehead.

01:25:54.608 --> 01:25:55.860
It was wonderful.

01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:58.654
And then he says,
"You're now the king."

01:25:58.821 --> 01:26:01.448
And he made, with
his own hands,

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:04.577
the crown that he gave me.

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:07.913
(jazz noir music)

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.583
- Halston, I think,
honestly believed

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:15.087
that Carl Epstein was going
to mediate with big business.

01:26:17.423 --> 01:26:19.925
But I remember
thinking to myself,

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:22.928
well, there are two
men in this room.

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:26.849
But there's only one king
at Halston Enterprises.

01:26:30.227 --> 01:26:32.938
(speaking in foreign language)

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:36.358
- Voila. (chuckling)

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:38.360
I thought, hey, this is fun.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:42.865
Clothes had to be made for
me similar to what he wears.

01:26:43.032 --> 01:26:46.243
Oh, my wife, my kids are
getting all these clothes.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:50.581
And then one day, he
introduces me to Liza Minnelli.

01:26:52.166 --> 01:26:54.710
I said, you know, this is,
to hell with the business.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:55.836
This is great.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:27:00.132
You know, this is
the way to live.

01:27:00.299 --> 01:27:01.967
- We had budget meetings
and, apparently,

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:03.385
theirs was a disaster.

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:06.805
Carl was not doing
what we agreed to.

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:08.599
I'm at the top,

01:27:08.766 --> 01:27:09.850
and I don't care what's
happening in the engine room.

01:27:10.017 --> 01:27:11.810
I know the engine
isn't running.

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:13.854
And it wasn't.

01:27:14.021 --> 01:27:15.522
Turn this into a brand.

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:17.816
Turn this into
something we can handle,

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:20.277
and stop having it be
this airy-fairy kind of,

01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:22.780
I work when I want to, I'm
not inspired, I'm an artist

01:27:22.947 --> 01:27:24.698
kind of thing.

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:27.493
- I read all the
personnel files,

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.745
and I had my rude awakening.

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:33.374
D. D. Ryan, I have to laugh.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:38.045
Halston said, "Well, she's
the resident geisha."

01:27:40.965 --> 01:27:42.925
Bill Dugan was another one.

01:27:43.092 --> 01:27:45.219
He said, "Well, he amuses me."

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.472
And then he had Victor Hugo.

01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:51.350
I'll never forget once,
he called me, frantic,

01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:54.103
Victor Hugo was gonna kill him.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:59.149
- Victor held the entire office
captive for several hours.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.902
He was kind of like a mad dog.

01:28:02.069 --> 01:28:03.779
- Probably shocking to Carl,
because I don't think Carl

01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:06.198
was in the habit of
taking drugs, period.

01:28:06.365 --> 01:28:08.701
Except, you know, Pepto-Bismol.

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:12.413
- I just decided to duck out
and go to the Top of the Sixes

01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:15.582
and have some gin and tonics.

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:18.961
- It was a crazy
never-never land.

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:22.172
Then, I checked all
the expense stuff.

01:28:22.339 --> 01:28:24.049
And that blew my mind.

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:25.467
The flowers.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:28.053
(jazz noir music)

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.472
- Carl had me in
to talk to me about

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:33.225
what was being spent
on the flower budget.

01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:35.102
And I said,

01:28:35.269 --> 01:28:39.023
yes, I know what's being spent
on the flower budget, Carl.

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:41.734
I'm writing up
the bills myself.

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.610
- Esmark believed you
could have plastic plants

01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:45.696
instead of orchid plants.

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:46.864
They're plants.

01:28:48.115 --> 01:28:50.242
- Entertainment,
which was enormous.

01:28:50.409 --> 01:28:52.411
The kitchen cost.

01:28:52.578 --> 01:28:55.080
Example, they would
prepare a meal for him

01:28:55.247 --> 01:28:59.334
while he's in Montauk, and
put it on a private plane,

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:03.589
fly it to Montauk, and
deliver it to Halston's house.

01:29:03.756 --> 01:29:06.341
And that was a company expense?

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:09.678
That meal must
have cost $2,000.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:14.183
- (laughing) It was '80s.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.102
-  Martha Graham was
honored in Paris last night.

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:19.271
She was presented with
the Cross of the Chevalier

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:21.065
of the Legion of Honor.

01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:24.568
- The honeymoon ended when
he was going to go to Paris

01:29:24.735 --> 01:29:26.862
with Martha Graham.

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:29.990
He's gonna take
his staff with him.

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:33.243
We calculated the
cost of doing that.

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:36.872
And just the workroom,
it was 125,000.

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:40.584
So I then told Halston,
you can't do it.

01:29:40.751 --> 01:29:42.628
Halston was so incensed.

01:29:43.879 --> 01:29:46.048
"How dare you say no to me?"

01:29:47.174 --> 01:29:48.884
It was like Jekyll and Hyde.

01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:51.053
Suddenly Mr. Hyde came out.

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:55.724
From then on, I was the enemy.

01:29:57.476 --> 01:30:01.105
- Carl, every morning, would
put little sticky notes

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:04.983
on Halston's table about
what had to happen today,

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:07.027
or what things were
gonna be taken away.

01:30:07.194 --> 01:30:09.822
And he didn't like it.

01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:11.657
- We need to do this,
we need to do that.

01:30:11.824 --> 01:30:14.326
And it was just like,
you're bossing him around?

01:30:14.493 --> 01:30:16.620
Like, no one does that.

01:30:16.787 --> 01:30:17.996
- It was a big struggle.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:19.498
And it got worse and worse,

01:30:19.665 --> 01:30:21.208
and he started coming
in later and later

01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:27.339
so he wouldn't have to deal
with seeing those people.

01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:35.180
- Be careful, it's a
little dark here, hold on.

01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:46.984
History is filled with wars.

01:30:47.151 --> 01:30:49.153
But you have to
understand the difference

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:51.530
between strategy and tactics.

01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:54.783
Strategy is the art of war.

01:30:56.243 --> 01:30:58.412
Tactics is the art of battle.

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:04.042
The only real battle you must
never lose is the last one.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.712
(ominous music)

01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:14.052
- There was rumor that a
junior designer was coming in

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:18.098
to help with the JCPenney,
and just huge workload.

01:31:21.018 --> 01:31:23.729
- In the middle of February,
picked up the phone,

01:31:23.896 --> 01:31:28.108
and this very deep voice said,
"John Ridge, this is Halston."

01:31:28.275 --> 01:31:30.861
And he said, "Can
you come see me?"

01:31:31.028 --> 01:31:32.571
So of course, I did.

01:31:32.738 --> 01:31:36.491
And it turned out that it
wasn't really an interview.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:39.870
It was, "When can you start?"

01:31:40.037 --> 01:31:42.831
And I think he just needed
to know there was one head,

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:46.376
two arms, and that I knew
who Charles James was.

01:32:04.394 --> 01:32:06.521
- Probably after a month,
I went to Carl and said,

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:10.067
I'm leaving, this is just
an impossible situation.

01:32:10.234 --> 01:32:11.360
We were there
until eight, nine.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:13.779
We never knew when
we were leaving.

01:32:13.946 --> 01:32:17.741
I can't be responsible for
what the workroom cost.

01:32:17.908 --> 01:32:19.576
And Carl said to me,

01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:22.913
"Don't leave, things
are going to change."

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.749
(jazz noir music)

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:30.087
- There was something
called the Werner Report.

01:32:30.254 --> 01:32:33.465
But it was so hush
hush, I didn't see it

01:32:33.632 --> 01:32:37.469
until probably seven or eight
months after I was there.

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:38.971
When I read it,

01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:41.974
it dawned on me that
everything was tactical.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.226
They were gonna
solve their problem

01:32:44.393 --> 01:32:46.395
by how we train the staff,

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:50.023
how we make the staff
unafraid of Halston.

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:54.778
How they would learn to cope
with Halston and his tirades.

01:32:55.195 --> 01:32:56.989
Mahoney's attitude was,

01:32:57.155 --> 01:33:00.784
we are not gonna try
to control Halston.

01:33:00.951 --> 01:33:04.037
My strategy was going
back to square one.

01:33:05.455 --> 01:33:08.583
Sometimes the kindest thing
in the world you can do is

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:10.168
to say no to somebody.

01:33:11.628 --> 01:33:14.423
He started coming in at four
o'clock in the afternoon,

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:16.758
and he wants the
workroom to wait for him

01:33:16.925 --> 01:33:18.635
to come in at that time.

01:33:18.802 --> 01:33:21.763
I told him, it's
not gonna happen.

01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:26.226
They're gonna leave at five
o'clock, period, done, over.

01:33:28.145 --> 01:33:30.147
In the final analysis,

01:33:30.314 --> 01:33:33.358
he is like me and
everybody else in that place,

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:35.068
an employee.

01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:36.695
- Carl was answerable.

01:33:36.862 --> 01:33:39.698
And, you know, it's all
about the bottom line.

01:33:39.865 --> 01:33:41.575
-  That's
right, we knew that.

01:33:41.742 --> 01:33:46.163
- I suppose he was there to
just slowly push Halston out.

01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:47.581
They had the brand.

01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:50.584
Halston was the diva designer

01:33:50.751 --> 01:33:54.379
that they didn't
necessarily need anymore.

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:57.424
Halston started
taking legal counsel.

01:34:00.052 --> 01:34:03.221
- When I first met him,
he was quite distraught.

01:34:03.388 --> 01:34:05.349
He was so frustrated
and so angry

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:09.561
he had trouble completing
sentences and thoughts.

01:34:09.728 --> 01:34:11.355
Suddenly he was cast adrift.

01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:13.190
Well, I guess I can best put
it the way Halston put it,

01:34:13.357 --> 01:34:16.610
that the folks from
Planet Tampon landed

01:34:16.777 --> 01:34:17.903
on Planet Halston.

01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.781
(dramatic music)

01:34:20.947 --> 01:34:22.032
-  I'm going to
pass this back and forth

01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:23.575
like this.
- Okay, all right.

01:34:23.742 --> 01:34:24.659
-  You don't
have to worry about.

01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:26.411
- I saw him tired at times.

01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:28.872
I thought he was really tired.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.084
- One time I came in,

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:35.670
and I think he might
have had a panic session.

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:39.633
He just seemed very stressed.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:40.759
And I said, can I do anything?

01:34:40.926 --> 01:34:42.844
He said, "No, just sit here.

01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:44.262
"Just sit here."

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:47.432
And we sat there for,
like, 30 minutes.

01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:50.268
Wow, that's new.

01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:56.274
- Halston never asked me what
I thought of his collection.

01:35:01.238 --> 01:35:04.825
This time, he asked me what
I thought of his collection.

01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:07.285
And, honestly, it was like
someone had punched me

01:35:07.452 --> 01:35:12.082
in my stomach, because I
knew that he was feeling

01:35:12.249 --> 01:35:14.209
not as strong as he had been.

01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:15.961
And it made me sad.

01:35:18.588 --> 01:35:20.298
-  If you
lived in another epoch

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:23.593
in another time in another
city, could you pick it for me?

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.428
- Oh, no way.

01:35:24.594 --> 01:35:25.804
I like right now.

01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:27.139
And tomorrow's
going to be better,

01:35:27.305 --> 01:35:28.807
and next week is
going to be better.

01:35:28.974 --> 01:35:30.767
No, no, no, I'm the
all-time optimist.

01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:33.061
No, I like right now.

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:35.605
- The problem was simply drugs.

01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:40.193
He had gone way too far.

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.320
- I don't do tuxedos.

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:44.281
- He was out of control.

01:35:45.824 --> 01:35:50.829
Out of control was symmetrical
with Esmark taking over.

01:35:50.996 --> 01:35:53.874
So you tell me which is the
chicken and which is the egg.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.793
- Some time in that spring,
Liza went to Betty Ford.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:00.714
And Halston said, "It's great
that things like this exist

01:36:00.881 --> 01:36:02.007
"for those who need them.

01:36:02.174 --> 01:36:03.425
"Of course, the rest of us

01:36:03.592 --> 01:36:05.760
"have to get on
and earn a living."

01:36:07.471 --> 01:36:11.641
- Very hard to do an interview
about your best friend,

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:15.896
especially if what's
popular in that day and age

01:36:16.062 --> 01:36:17.689
is digging a little.

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:19.191
I don't like it.

01:36:19.357 --> 01:36:21.026
I hated it when they
did it to my mother

01:36:21.193 --> 01:36:23.028
or my father or myself.

01:36:23.195 --> 01:36:26.698
And I won't do it to
Halston, I just won't.

01:36:26.865 --> 01:36:28.658
I refuse.

01:36:33.622 --> 01:36:37.292
(audience applauding)

01:36:37.459 --> 01:36:40.795
- In June, he had summer
to do for JCPenney,

01:36:42.255 --> 01:36:45.383
Which was way late
at that point.

01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:47.511
- Halston cooled off.

01:36:47.677 --> 01:36:50.055
He don't want do
JCPenney anymore.

01:36:50.222 --> 01:36:51.556
I don't know why,

01:36:51.723 --> 01:36:53.683
but that's when everything
went upside-down.

01:36:53.850 --> 01:36:56.436
(dramatic music)

01:36:57.646 --> 01:36:59.147
- I think he thought
that if he went on strike

01:36:59.314 --> 01:37:02.067
and didn't design
the collections

01:37:02.234 --> 01:37:06.238
that he had some power over
the situation, you know.

01:37:07.405 --> 01:37:09.074
- I'm getting calls
from JCPenney saying,

01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:10.909
"Where are our products?

01:37:11.076 --> 01:37:12.452
"Where are the designs?

01:37:12.619 --> 01:37:14.829
"He hasn't approved them."

01:37:14.996 --> 01:37:18.041
And whether he was doing
that to get revenge on Carl,

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:20.001
or whether he was doing it
because he was doped up,

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:21.795
it wasn't happening.

01:37:21.962 --> 01:37:23.380
- They were very frustrated

01:37:23.547 --> 01:37:27.217
because they couldn't get
sketches from Halston.

01:37:27.384 --> 01:37:28.885
So one day, I
drew them a jacket

01:37:29.052 --> 01:37:30.387
'cause they had to
have a jacket,

01:37:30.554 --> 01:37:31.680
and Halston wasn't there,

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:35.433
and I, well, he
was not too happy

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.811
that I'd given them a sketch.

01:37:39.646 --> 01:37:43.108
But Penney's was
very happy about it.

01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:45.652
And I think that they went
away viewing me as a source

01:37:45.819 --> 01:37:49.656
that they could turn
to and get something.

01:37:49.823 --> 01:37:51.866
And that was kind
of the beginning

01:37:52.033 --> 01:37:55.203
of my personal
relationship with Penney's.

01:37:56.496 --> 01:37:57.664
-  It
is inappropriate

01:37:57.831 --> 01:37:59.583
to have John Ridge
involved in areas

01:37:59.749 --> 01:38:02.043
which do not fall under
his responsibilities,

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:03.878
signed Halston.

01:38:04.045 --> 01:38:06.423
To John Ridge
from Carl Epstein.

01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:08.800
Please keep up the good work.

01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:13.221
- Carl was hell-bent
on isolating Halston.

01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:16.850
Halston felt that he could
no longer work with Carl.

01:38:17.017 --> 01:38:19.519
All he was good
at was destroying.

01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:22.522
We decided the best
thing for Halston

01:38:22.689 --> 01:38:24.232
would be to go to Montauk

01:38:24.399 --> 01:38:28.361
and give everybody a chance
to take a deep breath.

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:31.448
We thought that there would
be a deep breath taken also

01:38:31.615 --> 01:38:33.825
on the part of
the Esmark people.

01:38:33.992 --> 01:38:35.619
Turned out not to be the case.

01:38:35.785 --> 01:38:37.746
(jazz noir music)

01:38:37.912 --> 01:38:40.582
-  Carl started
cleaning house.

01:38:40.749 --> 01:38:44.002
D. D. Ryan, Bill Dugan.

01:38:44.169 --> 01:38:46.254
- I was fired.

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:48.590
- May I have your
attention, please?

01:38:48.757 --> 01:38:50.008
- They couldn't touch me

01:38:50.175 --> 01:38:52.052
because he still
had an office there

01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:54.888
and I was still his secretary.

01:38:55.055 --> 01:38:57.515
I remember him calling me.

01:38:57.682 --> 01:39:00.810
Carl held a meeting in
front of all the employees

01:39:00.977 --> 01:39:03.063
at Halston Enterprises.

01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:07.067
He said that it would no
longer be a one-man show.

01:39:08.318 --> 01:39:09.819
John David Ridge was promoted

01:39:09.986 --> 01:39:12.739
and would be in
charge of the design.

01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:15.742
He is livid.

01:39:15.909 --> 01:39:16.993
"It's my name on the label.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.745
"How dare you?"

01:39:18.912 --> 01:39:20.872
-  It was his
company, his people,

01:39:21.039 --> 01:39:23.458
his workers, everything.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:25.085
So, we went back

01:39:25.251 --> 01:39:29.881
and it unraveled into a
very unpleasant scenario.

01:39:30.048 --> 01:39:32.592
- It was like having two
chefs in the kitchen.

01:39:32.759 --> 01:39:35.845
Everybody was saying,
well, let's divide

01:39:36.012 --> 01:39:37.180
the space up there,

01:39:37.347 --> 01:39:38.890
and this half is Halston

01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:41.935
and this other half is
Halston III with John Ridge.

01:39:42.102 --> 01:39:44.062
- At some point, I said no.

01:39:45.397 --> 01:39:48.608
No, you can get someone else
to do it, but I'm not going.

01:39:48.775 --> 01:39:52.904
I knew, at this point, I knew
Halston pretty well, the man.

01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:56.324
- There was a lot
of angst going on.

01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:59.160
And so, I had my first
meeting with Roy.

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:01.037
"Yes, Bregman, what
can I do for you?"

01:40:01.204 --> 01:40:06.251
And I'd say, well, Roy, that
was the beginning. (laughing)

01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:13.091
He was talking about going
into another business.

01:40:13.258 --> 01:40:15.093
That's why I started
calling him Roy.

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:17.345
I said, you don't
own your name, pal.

01:40:17.512 --> 01:40:18.388
Read the small print.

01:40:18.555 --> 01:40:19.973
We own your name.

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:22.767
(dramatic music)

01:40:24.436 --> 01:40:26.438
- This was all blowing up.

01:40:27.647 --> 01:40:32.652
They said to me, "I want you
to go in and talk to him."

01:40:32.819 --> 01:40:34.571
I was there that morning, too,
we were sitting, he and I,

01:40:34.738 --> 01:40:38.032
in his office, till about
one, 1:30 in the morning.

01:40:38.199 --> 01:40:41.369
And he said to me,
"We can do this."

01:40:41.536 --> 01:40:43.663
I said, we can do what?

01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:46.791
He said, "We can take this over

01:40:46.958 --> 01:40:48.168
"and get it away
from the corporation

01:40:48.334 --> 01:40:49.544
"and run it as an."

01:40:49.711 --> 01:40:52.005
I said, Halston, it
would never work.

01:40:52.172 --> 01:40:53.715
Where is this money
gonna come from?

01:40:53.882 --> 01:40:57.010
I said, do you know how
much money you spend?

01:40:57.177 --> 01:40:58.470
And how luxurious.

01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:01.347
I said, just take
a look around.

01:41:01.514 --> 01:41:03.433
You've had the
biggest and the best.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.520
And this kind of money is
not gonna be found again.

01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:15.695
- They requested, and I put
that in quotation marks,

01:41:15.862 --> 01:41:18.656
that I not be present
at the meeting.

01:41:21.159 --> 01:41:22.494
I'm sitting in my office,

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:25.371
and I felt like
having a cup of tea.

01:41:25.538 --> 01:41:27.248
So I thought I'd go
into the kitchen.

01:41:27.415 --> 01:41:30.627
I go to the door, put
my key in the lock,

01:41:30.794 --> 01:41:32.170
key is not working.

01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:35.715
I couldn't understand,
why the key?

01:41:35.882 --> 01:41:38.426
So I run around
to the front door.

01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:43.306
And there's a guy working on
the door there, a locksmith.

01:41:43.473 --> 01:41:45.308
He's changing the locks.

01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:48.603
I said, who hired you?

01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:49.729
- Mr. Halston.

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:58.530
- I stormed into that meeting,
and I just blew my top.

01:41:59.697 --> 01:42:02.200
Even his lawyer was shocked.

01:42:02.367 --> 01:42:04.577
- (laughing) No, Halston
didn't change the locks.

01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:05.912
He was locked out.

01:42:07.831 --> 01:42:10.208
Carl admitted he
changed the locks.

01:42:10.375 --> 01:42:12.085
- Job is done, Mr. Epstein.

01:42:12.252 --> 01:42:13.753
-  You
actually admitted it.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.588
- I admitted it?

01:42:15.755 --> 01:42:18.758
-  In Women's Wear
Daily, several months later.

01:42:18.925 --> 01:42:23.388
When there was a story about
trouble at the Olympic Tower.

01:42:25.932 --> 01:42:29.853
- I said, look, that's
it, I've had it.

01:42:30.019 --> 01:42:31.437
You know, I don't wanna
have to think about

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:33.022
somebody changing the locks.

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:35.733
Either he goes or I go.

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:43.032
- When Epstein gave 'em
the signal, they said,

01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:45.577
"We're done, you're done."

01:42:45.743 --> 01:42:49.455
And Halston was out.

01:42:54.419 --> 01:42:56.129
- It was weird.

01:42:56.296 --> 01:43:02.135
It was surreal that this coup
d'etat happened so quickly.

01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.351
- I was very
heartbroken for him.

01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:12.896
He was like a man
without a country.

01:43:13.062 --> 01:43:14.272
The Halston name,

01:43:15.815 --> 01:43:18.610
that was the most important
thing in his entire life,

01:43:18.776 --> 01:43:23.031
could be used by
that corporation

01:43:23.197 --> 01:43:24.616
without his consent.

01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:28.328
- Halston Enterprises
and Organization MINE,

01:43:28.494 --> 01:43:32.874

-  Week after
week, month after month,

01:44:02.445 --> 01:44:06.324
he realized that he didn't
have much clout anymore

01:44:06.491 --> 01:44:07.784
with the company.

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:11.913
-  When one comes in
to make a company healthy,

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:15.458
it depends how
you define health.

01:44:15.625 --> 01:44:17.502
-  People were
suddenly at peace,

01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:21.339
had comfortable jobs,
were not being shouted at.

01:44:22.924 --> 01:44:24.342
-  We had not much to do.

01:44:24.509 --> 01:44:25.969
No movie star.

01:44:26.135 --> 01:44:27.512
No celebrity.

JCPenney, and that's it.

01:44:31.307 --> 01:44:33.142
And not even,
because at one point

01:44:33.309 --> 01:44:35.186
they used to do
everything in China.

01:44:35.353 --> 01:44:37.563
We just would send the pattern,

01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:40.692
and they used to make
everything there.

01:44:44.362 --> 01:44:45.738
-  Carl told me one day

01:44:45.905 --> 01:44:48.700
that he was gonna sell
off all the samples.

01:44:53.746 --> 01:44:58.001
-  That was his record
that should be in a museum,

01:44:58.167 --> 01:45:01.671
and they decided to sell
those important pieces

01:45:01.838 --> 01:45:04.090
for 25 bucks, 50 bucks apiece.

01:45:08.177 --> 01:45:09.303
- But it was just
stuff sitting there,

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:11.848
year after year, doing nothing.

01:45:15.977 --> 01:45:18.980
- Some pieces went here,
some pieces went there.

01:45:19.147 --> 01:45:25.236
But the mother lode of it
is gone, eliminated, erased.

01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:27.989
It was hostile.

01:45:28.156 --> 01:45:30.158
- There was nothing
personal about it.

01:45:30.324 --> 01:45:32.285
If you want to call
something personal,

01:45:32.452 --> 01:45:33.828
I really didn't give a damn

01:45:33.995 --> 01:45:36.497
what Halston's
reaction would be.

01:45:36.664 --> 01:45:38.374
We were beyond that.

01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:41.419
-  Why not
give it to a museum?

01:45:44.672 --> 01:45:45.882
- And then there was a bookcase

01:45:46.049 --> 01:45:48.426
full of video
tapes of the shows.

01:45:48.593 --> 01:45:50.178
Said to Carl, well,
I want these tapes.

01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:52.388
He said, "No,
Halston has copies."

01:45:52.555 --> 01:45:54.057
(static crackling)
(audio screeching)

01:45:54.223 --> 01:45:55.850

01:45:56.017 --> 01:45:57.143
I'm Halston.

01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:58.770
- Carl said he was
gonna erase them

01:45:58.936 --> 01:46:01.898
and sell the blanks
to the next tenant.

01:46:05.401 --> 01:46:07.278

01:46:07.445 --> 01:46:09.238

So, my grandparents, this is
Hallie Mae and James Edward.

(gentle guitar music)

01:46:57.662 --> 01:46:59.247
They were working class.

01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:04.085
My grandmother, I'm not sure,
made it past ninth grade.

01:47:04.252 --> 01:47:06.003
They had four children.

01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:09.841
My father first.

01:47:10.007 --> 01:47:13.719
And then Roy Halston
Frowick came along in 1932.

01:47:18.057 --> 01:47:19.142
You know, times were tough.

01:47:19.308 --> 01:47:21.561
Grew up in the Depression era.

01:47:24.188 --> 01:47:26.649
Halston and my father weren't
close with their father.

01:47:26.816 --> 01:47:29.527
They loved him, but
he had a temper.

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.615
My grandmother took
him under her wing

01:47:34.782 --> 01:47:37.910
and was sort of protecting him.

01:47:38.077 --> 01:47:42.456
She was a sweet, sweet,
soft-spoken, very mellow woman,

01:47:42.623 --> 01:47:46.669
and you just felt
so calm around her.

01:47:51.716 --> 01:47:54.760
When she passed away, Halston
was in the middle of JCPenney,

01:47:54.927 --> 01:47:56.929
but he didn't tell
them anything.

01:47:57.096 --> 01:47:59.265
He just said he had to leave.

01:48:01.267 --> 01:48:02.894
He suffered silently.

01:48:06.564 --> 01:48:10.067
Halston wasn't estranged
from his family per se,

01:48:10.234 --> 01:48:12.528
it's just that the
family's very conservative.

01:48:12.695 --> 01:48:16.490
He felt that they wouldn't
understand his lifestyle

01:48:16.657 --> 01:48:19.368
with Victor there, and although
he was constantly trying

01:48:19.535 --> 01:48:21.746
to get him out of his
life, and I was there.

01:48:21.913 --> 01:48:23.581
And eventually he did.

01:48:25.917 --> 01:48:29.086
I kept trying to tell him to
reconnect with his siblings,

01:48:29.253 --> 01:48:31.255
telling him, they're
not gonna judge you.

01:48:31.422 --> 01:48:33.090
The family's there for you.

01:48:33.257 --> 01:48:35.676
And at a certain point,

01:48:35.843 --> 01:48:39.305
I helped him organize the first
family reunion in Montauk.

01:48:48.814 --> 01:48:51.108
He let his hair down

01:48:51.275 --> 01:48:54.654
and was the brother that
he was 40 years prior.

01:48:59.533 --> 01:49:02.828
But he was who he was,
so he had to plan it,

01:49:02.995 --> 01:49:05.248
every moment of it.

01:49:05.414 --> 01:49:08.584
They got all white sweat
suits for one event,

01:49:08.751 --> 01:49:12.296
and they got all Army
uniforms for the safari.

01:49:14.173 --> 01:49:16.759
- He loved life and you
could tell that about him.

01:49:16.926 --> 01:49:17.969
You could tell.

01:49:20.346 --> 01:49:25.101
- I think he just wanted,
maybe to slow down a little.

01:49:25.268 --> 01:49:26.769
Being a regular person.

01:49:28.104 --> 01:49:30.564
Here, he was Halston.

01:49:30.731 --> 01:49:33.901
But I think inside,
he was, you know, Roy.

01:49:38.781 --> 01:49:41.033
- It came to a
point where he said,

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:44.620
"I'm not gonna be able
to go back to designing,

01:49:44.787 --> 01:49:47.290
"so you need to kind of
pursue your own life."

01:49:47.456 --> 01:49:49.292
You know, he didn't
want to hold me back.

01:49:49.458 --> 01:49:54.130
So I decided to
move to California.

01:49:54.755 --> 01:49:57.800
(gentle guitar music)

01:49:57.967 --> 01:50:00.803
It was a difficult
decision to make.

01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:02.471
But I bought a car

01:50:02.638 --> 01:50:04.932
and told him I wanted
to take him for a drive

01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:08.269
up the Hudson River
to blow off the stink.

01:50:12.064 --> 01:50:14.442
It was a beautiful,
sunny Sunday.

01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:16.819
And at certain point,
through the chatter, he said,

01:50:16.986 --> 01:50:19.322
"Well, I have to
tell you something."

01:50:19.488 --> 01:50:20.906
And he revealed to
me at that point

01:50:21.073 --> 01:50:23.034
that he was sick with HIV.

01:50:24.493 --> 01:50:28.039
And I just shut down and
started freaking out.

01:50:29.957 --> 01:50:32.668
And he said, "It's
not a death sentence."

01:50:32.835 --> 01:50:34.879
So I did the stiff
upper lip thing,

01:50:35.046 --> 01:50:37.298
'cause he didn't
like people to cry,

01:50:37.465 --> 01:50:38.924
and just went
along with it like,

01:50:39.091 --> 01:50:41.594
no, it's not a
death sentence, no.

01:50:45.389 --> 01:50:46.891
But you have to remember,

01:50:47.058 --> 01:50:49.393
so many people were
getting sick in those days.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:52.313
- The fashion industry here
is being devastated by AIDS.

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.190
-  When Perry
Ellis died in 1986,

01:50:54.357 --> 01:50:56.192
his company denied
it was AIDS-related.

01:50:56.359 --> 01:50:58.110
- There is no drug,
there is no treatment,

01:50:58.277 --> 01:51:01.113
there's no vaccine, there's no
prevention, there is no cure.

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.074
- No one was beating it.

01:51:04.575 --> 01:51:05.785
I was terrified.

01:51:06.952 --> 01:51:09.205
I was scared for him.

01:51:09.372 --> 01:51:10.498
- I didn't wanna leave.

01:51:10.664 --> 01:51:12.124
I kept asking him
and asking him,

01:51:12.291 --> 01:51:14.377
and even the last day I
said, I can stay here.

01:51:14.543 --> 01:51:17.338
I can live here, I can be
your nurse, I can take you,

01:51:17.505 --> 01:51:19.507
I can get your stuff if
you don't want to go out.

01:51:19.673 --> 01:51:24.053
And he was like, "No, I
don't want you to do that."

01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:27.306
So I left.

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:41.028
- He handled it the way
he had to handle it.

01:51:41.195 --> 01:51:43.489
You know, denial, and then
fighting it and saying,

01:51:43.656 --> 01:51:44.698
"No, this is not
gonna take me."

01:51:44.865 --> 01:51:47.451
And then finally
realizing it had.

01:51:49.161 --> 01:51:51.956
(solemn music)

01:51:59.213 --> 01:52:00.965
He decided to sell the house.

01:52:12.393 --> 01:52:15.813
(gentle piano music)

01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:17.690
-  He decided
he was gonna live

01:52:17.857 --> 01:52:22.278
his last moments of his life
with his family in California.

01:52:24.363 --> 01:52:26.657
He didn't want anybody to know,

01:52:26.824 --> 01:52:30.828
so I didn't tell anybody
until I had to tell my dad.

01:52:35.374 --> 01:52:39.587
- He left, and he
completely hid away

01:52:39.753 --> 01:52:41.839
and didn't want
anybody to see him.

01:52:42.006 --> 01:52:44.383
- We would write him letters.

01:52:48.554 --> 01:52:51.432
- I did not know
that he was ill.

01:52:51.599 --> 01:52:53.726
I wish I could call him now.

01:52:56.187 --> 01:52:59.982
- That was a period
of people I knew

01:53:00.733 --> 01:53:03.611
that they will never come back.

01:53:03.777 --> 01:53:05.237
But I remember them.

01:53:06.697 --> 01:53:08.782
I don't regret those times.

01:53:08.949 --> 01:53:10.326
I am alone, though.

01:53:11.827 --> 01:53:13.412
And you are a voyeur.

01:53:16.582 --> 01:53:18.334
- I tried to find out
what was going on,

01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:21.253
and then I heard the stories
that he was in California,

01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:25.049
driving along the coast in
a convertible Rolls-Royce,

01:53:25.216 --> 01:53:29.470
enjoying his life with his
sunglasses and his hands out,

01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:32.473
enjoying the breeze.

01:53:33.891 --> 01:53:35.392
That's how I see him.

01:54:31.532 --> 01:54:36.328
(epic music)

01:54:41.375 --> 01:54:46.005
- He passed away the night of
the Academy Awards, actually.

01:54:46.755 --> 01:54:49.008
And his name was up on
a television screen.

01:55:00.853 --> 01:55:03.606
We had a beautiful ceremony,

01:55:03.772 --> 01:55:06.984
and we played Fanfare
for a Common Man.

01:55:07.151 --> 01:55:10.863
("Fanfare for the Common Man")

01:55:13.157 --> 01:55:14.450
Halston was a common man.

01:55:14.617 --> 01:55:16.160
He came from nowhere.

01:55:17.786 --> 01:55:21.582
At the end, he said, "I
just wanna fade away."

01:55:21.749 --> 01:55:25.586
But as somebody like him,
he couldn't just fade away.

01:55:29.965 --> 01:55:31.258
- The death of a great
American designer.

01:55:31.425 --> 01:55:33.093
His name was Halston.

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:35.471
He was only 57 when
he died in California.

01:55:35.638 --> 01:55:37.681
Yesterday he died as
the result of AIDS.

01:55:37.848 --> 01:55:39.016
- With AIDS.
- The cause,

01:55:39.183 --> 01:55:40.601
AIDS-related cancer.

01:55:40.768 --> 01:55:44.605
- We profoundly hope that
it has a positive impact

01:55:44.772 --> 01:55:47.232
on the public in becoming
increasingly aware

01:55:47.399 --> 01:55:50.319
of this terrible problem,
and doing something about it.

01:55:50.486 --> 01:55:53.030
(upbeat music)

01:55:57.951 --> 01:55:59.662
-  Five months later,

01:55:59.828 --> 01:56:04.041
Halston Enterprises closed its
Olympic Tower headquarters.

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:07.044
(audio screeching)

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.715
Today, fashion is fast.

01:56:13.926 --> 01:56:18.555
And high up above the streets,
in his beloved Olympic Tower,

01:56:21.266 --> 01:56:23.227
a private investment firm.

01:56:25.562 --> 01:56:27.898
It's morning again in America.

01:56:30.317 --> 01:56:33.070
- Does it look
pretty much the same?

01:56:35.197 --> 01:56:37.074
- Oh, sure it's fun
and it's not fun,

01:56:37.241 --> 01:56:40.494
and it's upbeat and downbeat
and everything else, you know.

01:56:40.661 --> 01:56:44.540
But as my mother says, it's
the price you have to pay.

01:56:45.874 --> 01:56:46.583
Thank you.

01:56:48.419 --> 01:56:49.253
Okay?

01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:50.254
