00:02.419 --> 00:05.380
[Dennis] Stop it. [Charlie] All right.
You're getting hung up on "can't."

00:05.464 --> 00:09.133
And I'm not saying that you can't.
I'm saying that it is illegal.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.885
No, it is not illegal!
Dude.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.970
Says the guy who knows
nothing about the law!

00:13.055 --> 00:15.306
I can absolutely keep
a hummingbird as a pet, bro.

00:15.391 --> 00:18.393
It's no different than having a parrot,
or a parakeet. It's a bird, bro.

00:18.477 --> 00:21.104
You really can't, and I'm
not saying I agree with it.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.773
It's just that bird law in this country-
it's not governed by reason.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.150
There is no such thing as bird law.
Yes, there is!

00:26.276 --> 00:28.945
I'm gonna get a hummingbird, and I'll show you.
You guys, I have huge news.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.364
Hummingbirds are illegal tender.
I'm gonna get one.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.408
You cannot.
To spite you, I'm gonna get one.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.410
Hello?
Where are we with gulls?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.787
You guys!
You can keep a gull as a pet.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.290
But you do not want to live with a seabird,
'cause the noise level alone on those things...

00:41.375 --> 00:44.377
Have you ever heard a gull up close?
It's gonna blast your eardrums out, dude.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.671
You guys, I'm serious!
I have huge news here!

00:46.797 --> 00:49.298
The principle is that you
can have any bird that- Yo!

00:49.425 --> 00:52.135
I got great news, guys.
Frank's got news?

00:52.261 --> 00:54.595
Frank's got news?
[Chanting] News, news, news, news!

00:54.680 --> 00:57.932
News, news, news, news,
news, news, news, news!

00:58.016 --> 01:01.561
I just bought a house
at a foreclosure auction.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.813
Holy shit!
That's amazing.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.857
Oh, is it? Is it "amazing"?

01:05.941 --> 01:08.234
- Now hang on. You're not moving out, are you?
- No, no, no, no.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.903
I bought this as an investment.
I bought it on the cheap.

01:10.988 --> 01:14.741
Ah, you might've missed the boat on that, Frank.
Not the best time to invest.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.743
I beg to differ with you.

01:16.827 --> 01:20.121
Now is the time to invest
because all the prices are low.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.958
As soon as the market turns around,
I'm gonna make a boatload.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.002
Frank's talking about flipping the house.
Flip the house!

01:26.128 --> 01:28.421
Making some money!
That's exciting.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.174
I'm having a baby!

01:34.386 --> 01:36.471
Do yourself a favor
and flush it out.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.390
No. That's not-
"Flush it out"?

01:39.475 --> 01:41.434
No. I'm not pregnant. I...

01:41.518 --> 01:43.978
I answered an ad for a couple
who wants a surrogate.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.774
See, people who can't have kids are willing to
pay a shitload of money to people like myself,

01:47.858 --> 01:49.776
who can carry it for them.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.320
Wait. What's going on?
You're carrying someone's baby somewhere?

01:52.404 --> 01:57.325
H-Hold it. I am not spending
money on another little bastard.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.119
- I did that already, twice.
- Come on.

02:00.204 --> 02:03.956
No. They're keeping the baby. It's their baby.
How are you guys not understanding this?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.501
Uh, Dee, before you
continue this babbling,

02:06.585 --> 02:09.002
does your thing
involve us in any way,

02:09.086 --> 02:11.589
or are you just
kind of- at us?

02:11.673 --> 02:15.343
Well, no. It's just that's huge news, so
I figured you guys might want to know.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.929
It doesn't matter. Let's just talk about the house!
Let's talk about the house!

02:18.013 --> 02:20.932
Hold on one second. Actually, Dee
being pregnant is pretty big news.

02:21.058 --> 02:24.143
Now, we could take the house idea and
the baby idea and merge the two things.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.687
It just feels muddy though.
Let's just stick with one. It's cleaner, right?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.731
- It could be an interesting-
- House.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.817
But I'm just saying that if- House.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.486
I don't know exactly how we would take
the two ideas and put them together.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.613
House! But I think if we
came up with something...

02:35.697 --> 02:37.490
[Chanting]
House! House! House!

02:37.616 --> 02:39.617
Just the house thing?
House! House! House! House!

02:39.701 --> 02:44.372
House, house, house, house, house,
house, house, house, house, house!

02:44.456 --> 02:45.623
Flush, flush, flush!

03:19.616 --> 03:23.035
Deandra? Thank you so much
for responding to our ad in the paper.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.205
You're welcome. We've had so many
letdowns going through the agency.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.375
Yeah. We thought we'd just try to
find a surrogate by ourselves.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.795
I just feel really honored to be able to provide
a service for a lovely couple like yourselves.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.505
Good. Thank you.
Yeah.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.258
We just had a couple questions
we'd like to ask you. Shoot.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.677
Honey, why don't you-
Okay. So- Sorry.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.305
But do you have any history
with drugs or alcohol?

03:42.431 --> 03:45.057
Never. Neither.
That's great.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.977
Um, any- any family history
of mental illness?

03:48.061 --> 03:51.397
Uh, well, my brother's
a dick, if that counts.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.566
I don't- I don't think so.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.443
It's just a joke though, Sean.
So, the next one?

03:55.569 --> 03:58.362
And- And- Okay.
So what about your medical history?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.781
Is there any health problems
we should know about?

04:00.866 --> 04:02.783
Kate, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.745
I have never had a health
problem in my entire life.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.455
Wow.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.082
Clean as a whistle.
That's amazing.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.169
- Down here, up here, wherever.
- This is all great news. I mean...

04:13.295 --> 04:15.212
Isn't it?
Yes, it really is.

04:15.297 --> 04:18.048
Okay, great. So let's talk turkey.
And by that, I mean money.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.843
Oh. We just thought we'd pay
the standard rate of $20,000.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.929
20,000. Okay.
Yeah.

04:23.013 --> 04:27.099
I like the sound of that. I'm gonna throw
something at you guys, so brace yourselves.

04:27.184 --> 04:31.979
What are your thoughts on
doubling down, so to speak,

04:32.064 --> 04:34.649
and going for twins?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.776
[Chuckles] Right?

04:36.860 --> 04:38.611
No.
No.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.906
If it's a matter of price, I'm willing
to cut you a deal on the second one.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.950
And we don't
have to stop at two.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.453
I've typed up a price sheet I would
like the two of you to peruse.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.331
If you'll look down
around number four or five,

04:50.415 --> 04:52.625
that's when you really
start to see some savings.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.461
You guys want to go for an Octomom thing?
Huh? I'm game.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.464
You want to have 10?
You want to outdo that bitch?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.883
I'll have that conversation.
I'm kidding.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.927
I don't want 10 people
inside of me.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.971
But-
This is great.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.140
I-I just- I think we're really
just gonna do the one,

05:08.225 --> 05:10.142
I think is- is what we want.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.354
One baby.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.607
Look for shit on the walls,
'cause that's what they do.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.152
When they know they're getting thrown out of a
house, they smear feces all over the walls.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.904
Really?
Yes.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.825
They didn't do that here. This is a pretty nice house.
A little lived in maybe.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.369
Well, you know, I found something cooking on the stove.
That's pretty "unresponsible."

05:28.495 --> 05:31.038
Mac and cheese. I can't believe they
left all this stuff in the house.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.416
I mean, what's the deal?
Do we have to burn it?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.085
- Hey, get the hell out of our house!
- Jesus. There's people here!

05:36.169 --> 05:39.005
- Squatters!
- We're not squatters! This is our house!

05:39.089 --> 05:41.882
What do you mean your house?
I bought this house! We own this house!

05:41.967 --> 05:44.468
You didn't buy it from us!
You bought it from the bank. We didn't sell it.

05:44.553 --> 05:48.097
Oh, look, bitch! We bought it from them
because they foreclosed on your bitch ass!

05:48.223 --> 05:50.850
Yeah, yeah. You got proof? Proof?
What are you talking about, proof?

05:50.976 --> 05:53.436
A deed, paperwork.
Go get your proof. Proof.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.313
Bring it back here. We'll look at the paperwork.
Is that what you want?

05:56.440 --> 05:59.984
You want proof? I'll give you proof!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:00.068 --> 06:03.029
Frank, take it easy, bud.
Take it- You gotta use your head now.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.031
Think about the law.
All right?

06:05.115 --> 06:07.742
What happens if you accidentally
hit a child with an umbrella?

06:07.826 --> 06:10.870
In the eyes of the law, that is child abuse.
What happens then?

06:10.954 --> 06:14.790
In the eyes of the law, you have to give your
properties to the parents of that child.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.543
I'm sorry, little kid.
He doesn't know the law that well.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.379
I don't even know what the hell he's
talking about. It doesn't matter.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.506
We shouldn't bash these people up.
No. No!

06:22.591 --> 06:25.718
Of course we shouldn't bash
these people up! Look- Okay.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.096
Absolutely, we could cave
the husband's skull in here.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.767
Yes, we could take the wife down to the basement,
have a frenzied free-for-all with her.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.770
We could tie the kids up in their rooms
so they wouldn't hear any of it.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.939
Dennis, in that scenario, we'd have to kill
the kids 'cause they would've seen our faces.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.317
Right. We could smear
the walls with their blood.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.195
Guys, there are any number of twisted
scenarios that could play out here.

06:44.279 --> 06:48.282
But I think the easiest thing, really,
is to just go get the deed.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.785
Right. Why get weird?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.204
Let's just keep it simple.
For now, we take the high road.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.332
We'll take the high road.
Take the high road out of here.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.753
Oh, well, I'm so glad we're gonna
get to work with you, Deandra.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.256
Oh, Kate, Sean, I tell you what.
You guys are getting one hell of a uterus.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.634
Great. Okay. Well, listen.
It was really nice to meet you.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.053
Wow! This house really
opens up here, doesn't it?

07:09.179 --> 07:11.347
Uh- From the curb, it doesn't
really look like much.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.933
But once you get inside,
it's got a real ass on it.

07:14.017 --> 07:17.561
Well, thank you. It's always felt
a little empty without a family.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.688
Oh, shit! Is that a pool?

07:19.773 --> 07:23.484
Uh, yeah. Of course, when the baby
comes, we'll have a fence around it.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.569
Right, right, right.
How deep?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.071
The pool?
Yeah, the pool!

07:27.155 --> 07:29.073
- Uh, eight feet.
- Oh, man.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.826
You guys jackknife off this diving
board all the time or what?

07:31.910 --> 07:36.038
Oh, I used to be so good at those.
You mind if I get in?

07:36.164 --> 07:39.667
Um- Yeah, we- we have a
lot of stuff to do today.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.710
So-
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.964
No, errands are very important, but really,
the most important thing right now...

07:45.048 --> 07:48.676
is for me to stay relaxed, if you don't
want my tubes to get all tensed up.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.179
So, you want to go grab
a swimsuit for me to borrow,

07:52.264 --> 07:54.390
or should I just jump in
in my birthday gear?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.768
No. Don't do that. We'll- Honey, do
we have a suit that she can borrow?

07:57.853 --> 08:00.062
Sure. I'll go
get you that suit.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.231
[Sean] Okay.
Good girl.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.943
All right, Charlie.
We are gonna be gentlemen. Yup.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.904
We have the law on our side.
We just show them the deed. Mm-hmm.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.906
And then they vacate the premises.
Mm-hmm.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.076
And that's it. No reason to be animals about it.
And they changed the locks.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.787
Yes, they did. You were right, Frank!
They changed the locks, bud.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.831
I'm telling you, these people,
they're uncivilized deadbeats.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.875
Let's smash the door down.
All right, ready? Here we go.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.587
[Together]
And a-one, and a-two, and a-three...

08:24.671 --> 08:27.339
[Shouting]

08:27.424 --> 08:30.009
- [Groans] - [Charlie] Oh,
that- that was a bummer.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.179
Man. I gotta admit,
that's, uh...

08:33.263 --> 08:35.222
That felt
very unsatisfying to me.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.640
- [Frank] Yeah, I didn't like that.
- Should you guys, um...

08:37.767 --> 08:40.394
No. Try smashing it
from the inside?

08:40.477 --> 08:43.606
- Let's just give it another shot. And-
- [Charlie] Oh!

08:43.690 --> 08:45.941
- [Charlie] Give it another one.
- Kick it.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.112
- Nice, dude!
- My door!

08:50.197 --> 08:53.199
My door, deadbeat!
My door!

08:53.283 --> 08:55.910
And what's this shyster lawyer
doing here?

08:55.994 --> 08:58.537
Well, it is just so nice to
see you again, Mr. Reynolds.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.665
I see that you're still
just... horrible.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.543
Yes, you're horrible too.
And I hate your tie. Hey. All right.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.546
You know what?
This family behind me- Yeah.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.590
Has 90 days to vacate.
Deadbeats.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.592
Until then, you can't touch them.
That's bull bird, man.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.012
What do you got there?
Let me handle this, Frank. It's not bull bird.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.556
I'll tell you that right now.
He's making a few good points.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.183
Look, buddy.
Crap.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.685
I know a lot about the law
and various other lawyerings.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.729
I'm well educated, well versed.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.691
I know that situations like this,
real-estate wise, they're very complex.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.902
Actually, they're pretty simple.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.738
The forms are all
standard boilerplate.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.574
Okay. We're all hungry.
We're gonna get to our hot plates soon enough.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.576
All right? Well, let's talk
about the contract here...

09:37.661 --> 09:40.287
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Where did you go to law school again?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.207
Uh, well, I could ask you that very
same question. I went to Harvard.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.959
Ah.
Mm-hmm. How 'bout you?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.753
Where? Yeah? Hmm?
I'm pleading the Fifth, sir.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.755
I'd advise that you do that.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.091
I'll take that advice
into cooperation. All right?

09:52.175 --> 09:55.469
Let's say you and I go toe-to-toe on bird
law and see who comes out the victor.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.264
You know, I don't think
I'm gonna do anything close to that,

09:58.348 --> 10:00.975
and I can see clearly
you know nothing about the law.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.687
It seems like you have a tenuous grasp
on the English language in general.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.606
Okay. Well- Filibuster.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.694
Uh- Do you- Do you know
what that word means?

10:11.820 --> 10:13.487
Yup!
Yeah, what's that mean?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.531
[Sighs]

10:19.411 --> 10:21.704
- [Screams]
- [Door Shattering]

10:23.039 --> 10:25.457
I-I'm gonna- We're gonna- [Groans]

10:28.753 --> 10:31.714
[Frank] No, no, no.
Now I'm all churned up about this.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.049
I can't wait 90 days
to get rid of those people.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.968
I mean,
I gotta sell that house.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.679
Frank, don't be rash.
It's just 90 days.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.432
No. In 90 days, there's gonna
be shit all over those walls.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.559
[Scoffs] Those people are
gonna trash that house.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.644
We won't be able
to get a dime for it.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.688
I am calling
a Realtor right now.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.732
Oh, wait, Frank. Hold on a second.
[Phone Beeps]

10:49.816 --> 10:52.443
Maybe we could sell the house ourselves, you know?
Save the five percent.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.528
What do Realtors do anyway?
They pop on a blazer.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.697
They walk people through a house.
We can do that.

10:56.781 --> 11:00.284
Mac, the real estate business is something that
takes a lot of style and a lot of finesse,

11:00.368 --> 11:02.995
and that's something that the
two of us both have in spades.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.915
Absolutely. I'm thinking we do like a
classic good Realtor-bad Realtor dynamic.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.126
Oh, shit. I'm the good,
you're the bad?

11:09.252 --> 11:12.171
You're the sweet to my sour.
The honey to your vinegar?

11:12.255 --> 11:14.173
That's good, dude!

11:14.257 --> 11:17.176
- Honey and Vinegar Realty.
- I like that.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.220
I like the Honey and Vinegar.
I like what I'm hearing, boys.

11:20.305 --> 11:23.223
Okay! I knew that guy
was full of shit! I knew it!

11:23.350 --> 11:26.018
What guy?
That lawyer guy. Okay?

11:26.102 --> 11:29.730
He totally besmirched me today,
and I demand satisfaction from him.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.399
You want him to bang you?
Uh...

11:32.484 --> 11:34.360
No, Mac. Be serious, okay?

11:34.444 --> 11:37.529
He slandered me in front of a
jury of my own peers. All right?

11:37.655 --> 11:41.033
Look what they used to do when that sort of thing happened.
Take a look at this picture.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.912
- What do you see?
- I see two trannies shooting at each other.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.664
No, dude.
They're dueling, okay?

11:47.749 --> 11:51.210
These are lawyers settling an
argument by dueling it out.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.755
Now, how do you know
that the two trannies are lawyers?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.218
'Cause it's an old book, okay?

11:59.302 --> 12:02.721
I don't have to explain everything
to you about what I know!

12:02.806 --> 12:06.100
I'm trying to get satisfied from
this dude, and you're trying to...

12:06.184 --> 12:08.185
I'm getting satisfied.
I don't care.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.522
- What are you doing, Deandra?
- Collecting the money you bitches owe me.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.607
I'm going on maternity leave.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.234
What are you
jabbering about now?

12:15.318 --> 12:18.487
I got a sweet setup going on as a
surrogate for a couple of rich yuppies.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.572
They have a huge house,
kick-ass pool.

12:20.657 --> 12:24.118
I'm living the high life.
So suck on that, white stains.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.203
Oh, dude!

12:26.287 --> 12:28.747
I knew we should've done the baby thing.
Now there's a pool involved?

12:28.832 --> 12:31.667
When was the last time you swam in a pool?
I want to swim in the pool!

12:31.751 --> 12:35.129
- It's been like forever since I swam in a pool.
- No, no! Now, let's focus here.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.881
We gotta sell this house.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.676
And then we can go swim
in Deandra's pool.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.475
Hey, Vic.
You got that other snack tray?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.978
I certainly do, Hugh.
Certainly do. Okay, great.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.730
People are gonna be here any second.
I want them to be well fed.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.233
The house looks nice. The house looks nice.
It does look nice.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.068
Hey, hey, hey!

12:58.153 --> 13:00.946
You jerks aren't supposed to be here
when my mom and dad are at work!

13:01.030 --> 13:03.407
Your mom and dad aren't at work.
That's why they lost the house.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.035
They're probably at the dog track getting wasted.
Dude, eat my boogers.

13:07.162 --> 13:11.331
You eat my boogers! Whoa, whoa!
Hey, Vic, Vic. Whoa.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.584
Smell that vinegar
boiling up inside you.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.086
But I need you to save
some of it for the customer.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.088
Do that for me, okay, baby boy?

13:18.173 --> 13:20.215
What the hell's going on out here?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.676
- Frank, can you get these kids out of here?
- Yeah. Come on.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.012
We're gonna go paint your room
a color that's not stupid.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.055
Then we're gonna throw
your toys in the trash!

13:27.140 --> 13:29.266
Listen, I need you on my team.
You on my team?

13:29.392 --> 13:31.518
Yeah. I'm- I'm on your team.
All right, great. Yeah?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.520
Yeah. I just- He gets me-
That's good.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.397
[Knocking]
Oh! Here we go.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.317
- Hi! How are ya? - How you doing?
We're here to look at the house.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.903
Of course. Yeah, come on in. Hi.
I'm Hugh Honey. How you doing?

13:41.029 --> 13:43.363
Good. This is my associate,
Vic Vinegar. Hi. Tad.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.782
And we are here
to show you this house.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.202
Okay. Oh!
Good.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.163
Okay. [Chuckles] Come on in.
Great.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.582
Hi.
Okay.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.711
Good. All right. This is the living room.
Okay! Wonderful.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.798
Now, what do you folks think?
It's a beautiful house, right?

14:01.883 --> 14:04.843
Well, you know, I'm thinking this might
be a bit large for what we need.

14:04.928 --> 14:08.514
- Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
Is this house too big for you? - Now, Vic.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.850
Just a second, Hugh. Why don't you
ask your wife what she needs, pal?

14:11.935 --> 14:14.895
Oh, I'm sorry. Is she used to something smaller,
and you don't think she can handle it?

14:15.021 --> 14:18.148
Okay, I think we're gonna get going.
It's okay, you guys. I'm here.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.735
I want this to be a good experience for you.
Okay? I'll tell you what, buddy.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.071
How 'bout I take your wife upstairs
and show her what it's like...

14:24.155 --> 14:26.114
to be deep inside
a really big house?

14:26.241 --> 14:28.033
What?
What?

14:28.117 --> 14:30.035
What?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.579
Uh, you'll have to
excuse my associate.

14:32.664 --> 14:36.291
It's just his passion for quality real
estate that makes him so intense.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.418
Now, what can we do
to put you in this house?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.128
I think we're just gonna go now.
Yeah.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.506
Are you gonna buy the house?
[Woman] We're gonna go.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.758
Are you going to buy this house?
We don't want any trouble.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.719
Are you going to buy this house?
I don't know! I don't know!

14:47.845 --> 14:49.763
Are you going to buy this house?
Yes! Yes!

14:49.847 --> 14:51.682
"Yes" what?
Yes, I will buy this house!

14:51.808 --> 14:54.935
That's it. There we go. That's all I wanted to hear.
Congratulations, folks.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.187
You just bought
a brand-new house.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.189
Can we go?
Yeah!

14:59.274 --> 15:00.857
Go, honey. Go.
Congratulations.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.359
I'm going!
Just go!

15:02.485 --> 15:06.113
All right. We'll be in touch.
Oh! That was amazing, bro!

15:06.239 --> 15:09.241
You think that's gonna work?
Bro, it already did work. You heard the skirt.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.119
She said, "Yes, I will buy this house."
That is a binding verbal contract.

15:12.203 --> 15:15.163
Now, I heard it. You heard it.
And that pussy husband of hers heard it too.

15:15.248 --> 15:19.543
If they back out now, I will find them, I will
strangle them, I will beat them into oblivion!

15:19.669 --> 15:22.879
Wow! Wow!
I'm full of the vinegar.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.090
- Oh. Yeah!
- Hey. How'd it go?

15:25.216 --> 15:26.717
Sold it!
Sold the house.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.719
Sold it? Fantastic!

15:28.803 --> 15:31.597
Let's get another house,
flip it over, make some cash.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.016
It's not really the cash
that I care about anymore.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.101
It's the thrill of the sale
that I'm responding to.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.937
- You're driven by the thrill of the sale.
- You know what I'm thinking?

15:39.022 --> 15:42.899
Maybe it's time to merge
the two ideas after all.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.527
- Baby in the house?
- Baby in the house.

15:47.405 --> 15:51.908
[Chuckling] Honey and Vinegar?

15:51.993 --> 15:55.495
Okay. Jesus Christ.
All right. I'll get on it.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.706
Mmm.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.209
Well, well, well, well, well!

16:01.294 --> 16:05.464
If it isn't the big-time,
hotshot lawyer man.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.634
Oh, my God.
I do not have time for you.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.637
Yeah, so we both have busy schedules,
so I'll make this quick.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.056
I shan't mince words
with you for long.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.434
I am challenging you,
sir, to a duel.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.394
- I accept.
- Uh...

16:19.520 --> 16:22.731
[Pen Tapping On Desk]
[Chuckles] Are you serious?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.816
Yeah. I accept your challenge.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.569
Do you want time to think it over?
No!

16:27.654 --> 16:31.114
No. No, not at all.
Um, what time were you thinking of dueling?

16:31.199 --> 16:35.035
[Exhales] Any time is good, really.
I don't have...

16:35.119 --> 16:38.372
You don't have time 'cause you would
have to go out and get a proper gun.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.374
Oh. No, no, no.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.959
I have a gun. I actually keep one
right here in the drawer.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.128
You got one right there?
I don't need to see it.

16:45.254 --> 16:49.132
I like to keep it loaded because you never know
who's gonna walk into a law office these days.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.676
[Laughing] Safety first.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.220
- Right.
- So let's rethink some things.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.222
[Clears Throat]

16:55.306 --> 16:58.016
Let's say that you've
learned your lesson now,

16:58.101 --> 17:00.352
and I've learned
a little lesson.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.020
Hmm.
And we'll call it even,

17:02.105 --> 17:04.856
and I will respectfully
decline the duel.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.858
- Well, you can't decline.
- Eh?

17:06.943 --> 17:11.279
As you know, once the duel's been accepted,
you know, there's no backing out.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.949
I mean, that's the law.
Yup.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.992
Anyway, great! This is settled.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.996
And I was looking for something
to do tomorrow afternoon anyway.

17:20.123 --> 17:23.290
So I'm gonna pencil you in for
high noon tomorrow. Don't do it.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.127
- Don't do it.
- And, uh, don't worry...

17:26.212 --> 17:30.757
'cause, um, wherever you are,
I'll find you.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.468
- Yeah. - I'm gonna put one
right between your teeth.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.263
And it's just gonna pop out the
back of your neck. [Clicks Tongue]

17:41.978 --> 17:44.604
Hey, Deandra?
Can we talk to you for a sec?

17:44.689 --> 17:47.149
Hey, you guys.
Watch me bust out this sweet jackknife.

17:50.862 --> 17:54.865
- Oh! Whoa!
- [Gasps, Coughing]

17:54.949 --> 17:57.451
- [Laughing] You guys!
- Are you okay?

17:57.535 --> 18:00.120
- Oh, I biffed that one, huh?
- You "biffed" it?

18:00.204 --> 18:02.539
Whoo! Thank God there wasn't
a baby in there, huh?

18:02.665 --> 18:05.709
Could you get me a refill on that, guy?
What is this?

18:05.793 --> 18:07.878
Piña colada. Been crushing them.
They're great in the heat.

18:08.004 --> 18:11.047
Ah. I don't think you should
be drinking and swimming.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.008
- No.
- Dingdong! Hello.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.634
[Dee] Goddamn it.
Hello!

18:14.719 --> 18:16.386
- Hi.
- No, no, no, no, no.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.722
We're looking for Deandra Reynolds.
Oh, there she is.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.725
Wait, wait. Don't do that. We're the wealthy
homosexual couple she promised her womb to.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.103
Indeed, we are. I'm Hugh Honey, and
this is my partner, Vic Vinegar.

18:25.188 --> 18:28.231
We're partners in real estate,
and we're partners in life.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.901
[Dee Laughing] Oh, hi!

18:30.985 --> 18:33.361
Oh, hey!
Oh, you guys!

18:33.488 --> 18:36.490
How are you doing, sweetie?
Oh, excuse us for just one second.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.116
Oh, boy.
It's good to see you.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.619
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Do not ruin this for me!

18:40.703 --> 18:44.039
Dee, relax. Okay? We're gonna start a bidding
war, drive up the price of your womb.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.957
Why would I want you to drive
up the price of my womb?

18:46.042 --> 18:48.543
If we make this couple desperate enough for
money, they'll sell their house to us.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.921
We're buying every house in the neighborhood.
Yeah, check it out.

18:51.005 --> 18:54.382
We get the house, you get a higher price for
that kid you're crapping out. Everybody wins.

18:54.509 --> 18:57.135
We're merging the ideas. I didn't want
to merge the ideas in the first place.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.513
Well, we're merging 'em,
so get used to it.

18:59.597 --> 19:03.767
Uh, we're giving Deandra
$100,000 to carry a child for us.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.061
Now, I'll be providing
the sperm, of course.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.772
And I'll be providing the money because
I'm the breadwinner in the relationship.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.857
And I'm the trophy husband.
He's my bottom.

19:10.942 --> 19:14.611
Oh! I'm the power bottom.
Technically, I generate most of the power.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.905
Only because I'm giving out
so much power from the top.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.032
You need to generate power
to accept it.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.493
- Deandra, what the hell are they
talking about? - I don't know.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.954
Hey, Dee! Hey! Hey!

19:24.038 --> 19:26.039
[Sean] Who's this guy?
Oh, splinter!

19:26.165 --> 19:28.208
There's a gate, bro!
What the hell are you doing here?

19:28.292 --> 19:30.210
Pardon me, ma'am, sir.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.754
- Everything's fine 'cause Daddy's here now.
- Who are you?

19:32.839 --> 19:36.633
I'm the father of the baby growing inside of
her stomach, and I need a safe place to hide.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.177
What baby are you talking about, Charlie?
I'm not pregnant yet!

19:39.262 --> 19:42.222
- [Crashing]
- Abort!

19:42.306 --> 19:44.432
[Grunts]
Abort! Abort!

19:44.517 --> 19:47.435
- Do not buy this house!
- There's a goddamn gate!

19:47.520 --> 19:50.522
I just got done with that lawyer.
He threatened to sue me.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.400
- What? Why? - Well, I had those
kids painting their room.

19:53.484 --> 19:56.611
And then I told them to go down,
rip some copper pipes out.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.531
Their little hands got all bloody.
Big deal.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.701
And they- I had to give them
the house to settle the suit.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.245
Okay, that's it. You all are crazy,
and I'm asking you to leave.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.955
[Dee] Yes.
So, let's go.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.207
Please leave.
Oh, are you sure? Really?

20:09.292 --> 20:12.002
- This is a very inviting pool.
- You heard the guy! You heard him!

20:12.086 --> 20:16.631
Oh, you two.
I am so sorry about that.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.925
Boy, that was nuts, wasn't it?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.927
Yeah.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.388
You know, we're gonna have
to ask you to leave as well.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.016
But what about the baby?

20:26.142 --> 20:28.560
We're just gonna find someone else.
Oh, you guys!

20:28.686 --> 20:32.689
You got me there! I thought you were serious.
We are serious, Deandra.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.649
[Splashing]

20:34.775 --> 20:37.986
Oh, this shit is like a bathtub.
[Mac] Jackknife!

20:39.822 --> 20:43.033
Oh, yeah! Cannonball!

20:43.159 --> 20:45.619
Whoo!
[Mac] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

20:45.703 --> 20:48.038
- Oh, yeah!
- This is great.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.790
Come on in, Dee.
Chicken fight! Chicken fight!

20:50.875 --> 20:54.002
- [Dennis] Let's do a chicken fight!
- Chicken fight! Chicken fight!

20:54.086 --> 20:57.130
Chicken fight! Chicken fight!
Chicken fight!

20:57.214 --> 20:59.591
[Shouting]

20:59.675 --> 21:01.676
[Screaming]

21:01.761 --> 21:03.386
Yeah!
Yeah!

21:39.507 --> 21:42.425
