<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> A.N.T. Farm.

00:07.310 --> 00:08.210
I'm Jeanne Gossamer.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.310
I'm new here.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.410
Is there somewhere specific I should sit?

00:20.260 --> 00:22.390
Lexi Reed, this is Jeanne Gossamer.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.290
There's no one there.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.500
But Jeanne came into the classroom.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.400
I remember you were reading that catalog.

00:41.470 --> 00:42.440
She was never there?

00:53.550 --> 00:57.490
I feel so sorry for Cameron.
He's really hurting.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.560
And not just because he
ordered the cactus sandwich.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.300
Ow!

01:06.440 --> 01:09.040
Hey, Cameron.
Mind if we join you?

01:09.070 --> 01:12.140
Unless you'd rather be alone
with your invisible girlfriend.

01:12.180 --> 01:15.040
I have to say, though, she seems
like a bit of an airhead.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.210
Listen, don't worry,

01:18.250 --> 01:20.120
pretty soon, you'll forget
all about Jeanne.

01:20.420 --> 01:21.480
Jeanne!

01:23.550 --> 01:28.220
Wait. She was on that jeans catalog,
so she does actually exist.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.130
Maybe we can track her down.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.390
I see where you're going with this.

01:31.430 --> 01:33.530
You find her, Cameron meets her for real,

01:33.560 --> 01:35.430
she can shoot him down like an enemy plane,

01:35.460 --> 01:37.200
and then we can all get on with our lives.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.200
Good plan!

02:37.530 --> 02:39.430
This bakery is supposed to be great.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.470
I hear their sliced bread is the
best thing since sliced bread.

02:47.340 --> 02:50.210
Welcome to Hippo Stadium,

02:50.240 --> 02:54.110
where you are safe to enjoy
delicious ballpark food

02:54.140 --> 02:57.080
at prices that are out of this world!

02:58.450 --> 03:01.320
Hippo? Aren't you
the music business?

03:01.350 --> 03:04.420
I was. Now I'm that
restaurant business.

03:06.090 --> 03:07.190
Where's the bakery?

03:07.220 --> 03:09.290
I was all set
everything bagel.e

03:09.330 --> 03:11.060
I mean, If it really had everything on it,

03:11.090 --> 03:12.290
it would collapse under its own mass

03:12.330 --> 03:15.100
and it would turn into a black hole.

03:15.130 --> 03:16.500
I changed the theme.

03:16.530 --> 03:21.170
I checked this website
and what's out right now.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.440
And bakeries
right now. ut.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.480
What's very in, though,
is America's favorite pastime.

03:26.510 --> 03:27.480
Eating.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.380
And to a much lesser extent, baseball.

03:32.410 --> 03:36.320
Popcorn! Get your
fresh, hot popcorn here!

03:38.090 --> 03:40.350
Lexi?
She's working here?

03:40.390 --> 03:44.160
This is great! Lexi is always
bossing us around at school,

03:44.190 --> 03:47.390
but here, she'll have to serve
us, and we can boss her around.

03:48.430 --> 03:51.200
Yo! Blondie!
Popcorn here!

03:52.530 --> 03:55.470
What are you Ants doing here?

03:55.500 --> 03:58.240
Excuse me, young lady, but,

03:58.270 --> 04:03.510
I do not believe that is the proper
way to address paying customers.

04:03.550 --> 04:07.250
Sorry, paying customer.
What can I get you?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.420
Popcorn!
And make it snappy!

04:09.450 --> 04:11.390
That'll be eight bucks.

04:11.420 --> 04:14.260
What? I'd like
to do a spit-take.

04:14.290 --> 04:15.290
One soda, please.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.290
That'll be $10.

04:17.329 --> 04:18.329
Here you go.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.329
Thank you.

04:21.459 --> 04:25.500
Eight dollars?
For this tiny bag of popcorn?

04:25.530 --> 04:29.070
This is outrageous.
We demand to speak to your supervisor.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.140
You mean Hippo?
He's busy cleaning out the nacho machine.

04:38.310 --> 04:40.450
If you'd like, for an extra 25 cents,

04:40.480 --> 04:42.280
you can get the large popcorn.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.490
Yeah, we'll take the large.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.390
And hurry!
Chop, chop!

04:48.520 --> 04:50.190
Here you go.

04:57.470 --> 05:00.230
Well, you do get more for your money.

05:03.300 --> 05:07.140
I can feel the red hot kernels
burning tiny holes in my clothes.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.180
Cameron, great news!

05:16.210 --> 05:18.150
I called the catalog company
and talked them into

05:18.180 --> 05:21.020
giving me Jeanne's contact information.

05:21.050 --> 05:23.350
And even better, I ordered
these skinny denim capris!

05:25.190 --> 05:27.160
That's incredible!
I know!

05:27.190 --> 05:28.230
They were on sale!

05:30.100 --> 05:31.300
I meant about Jeanne.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.470
What did you find out?

05:32.500 --> 05:35.440
Well, her name is Vanessa LaFontaine,

05:35.470 --> 05:37.200
and she's here in San Francisco.

05:37.540 --> 05:39.210
Really?

05:39.240 --> 05:40.510
You're not messing with me,

05:40.540 --> 05:43.140
like that time you told me
the Earth was round?

05:43.180 --> 05:45.250
Even though on every map it's flat.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.420
Nope. And the best news is

05:48.450 --> 05:52.090
she's temporarily blind
from a modeling mishap.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.450
She lost her sight?
Mmm-hmm.

05:53.490 --> 05:54.450
How is that good news?

05:56.160 --> 05:58.360
Because she can't see what you look like,

05:58.390 --> 06:00.390
so you might actually
have a chance with her!

06:02.300 --> 06:05.060
Good point!
Before she gets her vision back,

06:05.100 --> 06:07.400
I can get her to fall in
love with my personality.

06:07.430 --> 06:10.100
Or your hopelessly deluded optimism.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.340
So how can I get her to spend time with me?

06:14.340 --> 06:16.380
I'll take care of that.

06:16.410 --> 06:22.020
So, Vanessa, darling, thank you
for agreeing to do this shoot

06:22.050 --> 06:24.150
for my new line of shades that combine

06:24.190 --> 06:26.050
sunglasses with fun.

06:26.090 --> 06:28.190
I call them, sunglafunses.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.030
Why don't you just call them funglasses?

06:32.060 --> 06:33.230
You're the model, darling.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.260
Less talking, more being pretty.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.470
So just to be clear,

06:39.500 --> 06:41.340
you are completely sightless?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.170
You can't see my wig and my costume?

06:45.210 --> 06:47.110
I mean, my hair and my outfit?

06:48.310 --> 06:50.480
No. But I can imagine
what you look like.

06:53.550 --> 06:56.490
Actually, no, I can't.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.390
So, darling, meet your fellow
fabu-luscious model in the shoot.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.190
This is Cameron.

07:05.230 --> 07:09.170
Hey, babe. Too bad
you can't see me.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.400
I'm incredibly handsome.

07:15.370 --> 07:20.140
Darlings, you look fabutastic together,

07:20.180 --> 07:22.410
but I'm not feeling you as a couple.

07:22.450 --> 07:25.280
I want you to spend some
romantic time together,

07:25.320 --> 07:28.190
get to know each other better.

07:28.220 --> 07:33.160
So you two, what's your
idea of the perfect date?

07:33.190 --> 07:34.460
I've always wanted to have a picnic...

07:34.490 --> 07:36.360
Done!
In a hot-air balloon.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.030
Done.

07:38.060 --> 07:39.230
Wait, what?

07:48.330 --> 07:51.270
Vanessa, take my jacket.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.370
It's windy way up here in the clouds.

07:55.070 --> 07:56.440
Are you sure we're outside?

07:56.470 --> 08:01.210
Because it smells like
dry-erase markers and paste.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.310
Uh, that's because we're flying above

08:03.340 --> 08:08.010
the famous Acme Dry-Erase
Marker and Paste Factory.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.960
Wow, there are a lot of annoying

08:17.990 --> 08:20.230
and unnecessary birds in the sky today.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.200
So, Vanessa, darling,

08:25.230 --> 08:27.970
what do you look for in a man?

08:28.000 --> 08:34.370
I like a guy who's tall, handsome,
smart, sophisticated...

08:34.409 --> 08:39.179
Um... You just described
Cameron perfectly!

08:41.080 --> 08:44.190
Can I touch your face so I can
feel exactly how handsome you are?

08:45.090 --> 08:46.320
Uh...

08:47.420 --> 08:48.990
Sure.

08:50.230 --> 08:54.100
Wow. You have
really chiseled features.

09:02.310 --> 09:07.280
Wow, that World War I fighter
plane is awfully close to us.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.950
Dangerously close.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.350
So, Cameron, do you work out?

09:15.390 --> 09:18.190
I like guys who are really buff.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.420
Can I feel your muscles?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.060
Uh...

09:22.330 --> 09:23.990
Here.

09:24.030 --> 09:24.990
Feel.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.130
Wow.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.030
Is this a pineapple ring?

09:32.070 --> 09:36.000
Uh, no, no, darling, It's a bracelet.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.040
Cameron got it for you.
Put it on her, darling.

09:43.140 --> 09:46.110
Lexi knocked us over with 200 pounds of popcorn.
We need to get her back.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.220
Yeah.
How's your head, Fletcher?

09:48.250 --> 09:49.220
Yeah.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.150
Anyway, here's the plan.

09:53.190 --> 09:55.390
Angus alters the website that
says what's in and what's out

09:55.420 --> 10:00.160
to get Hippo to change his business to
some place that will make Lexi miserable.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.460
How about a law firm?

10:01.500 --> 10:04.230
My dad's a lawyer.
He seems miserable.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.200
I know!

10:08.240 --> 10:11.370
What does Lexi hate more than
anything else in the world?

10:11.410 --> 10:12.370
Us?

10:14.070 --> 10:17.410
True. But I was thinking
horizontal stripes.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.280
Welcome to the Alcatraz Bistro.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.490
With prices so low, it's criminal.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.090
Wait, I don't understand.

10:33.190 --> 10:35.330
Lexi, why aren't you
dressed like a prisoner?

10:35.360 --> 10:37.500
Because the customers are the prisoners.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.400
Let's get out of here.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.440
Prison break in sector three!

10:46.470 --> 10:50.040
What the heck? Hey!

10:50.080 --> 10:54.150
Today's specials are whatever we feel like
serving you, you deviant dregs of society!

11:01.090 --> 11:02.220
You got to let me out of here!

11:02.260 --> 11:04.360
My cell mate has the crazy eyes!

11:09.100 --> 11:11.100
I demand to speak to the warden!

11:11.130 --> 11:15.230
Yeah, and I demand he tell us
what the dessert specials are!

11:15.270 --> 11:18.370
Not now. It's time
for the cavity search.

11:22.380 --> 11:25.250
Okay, no cavities.
You can have dessert.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.130
What's wrong, Cameron?

11:44.360 --> 11:47.100
And why aren't you using the tissues?

11:48.500 --> 11:51.170
Dad says they're for company.

11:54.210 --> 11:57.440
Why are you crying? I thought things
were going great with Vanessa.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.280
They were.

12:00.310 --> 12:02.450
But she just called and said she's
getting her bandages off tomorrow.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.350
A week early!

12:04.380 --> 12:07.350
She said she can't wait to see me in
all my tall, muscular handsomeness!

12:08.490 --> 12:10.460
What am I going to do?

12:10.490 --> 12:15.400
Don't worry, Cameron. Maybe Vanessa
will find you adorable and unique.

12:15.430 --> 12:19.100
Like that three-legged goat
we saw at the petting zoo.

12:20.270 --> 12:23.100
No, she's going to leave me forever.

12:27.210 --> 12:30.040
Maybe trying to trick
Vanessa was a bad idea.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.240
No kidding.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.250
I'm sorry, Cameron.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.480
But I just couldn't stand
to see you so unhappy.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.350
If there's anything I can do,

12:38.380 --> 12:42.450
anything at all, just let
me know and I'll do it.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.490
There is one thing you can do.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.090
There is? Name it.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.360
Make me a 6'4" hunk
of pure muscle! Now!

12:49.390 --> 12:51.060
Do it!

12:53.160 --> 12:55.070
I can't.

12:55.100 --> 13:00.470
But I think I might know someone who can.

13:00.510 --> 13:03.270
Quite a sticky wicket
you've gotten yourself into.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.210
But I think I could help, old chap.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.210
Can you help without the accent?

13:09.380 --> 13:10.350
Fine!

13:12.080 --> 13:13.250
I've invented a few gadgets

13:13.280 --> 13:15.350
that will help you look like a new man.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.020
Check out these shoes.

13:18.220 --> 13:22.260
Shoes?
I already have shoes.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.430
These aren't your ordinary,
run-of-the-mill shoes.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.400
They're elevator shoes.
Observe.

13:37.310 --> 13:40.150
Now, this I'm really proud of.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.110
Watch this watch.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.450
Watch which watch?
Your wristwatch?

13:44.480 --> 13:46.390
Wow, that's a tongue twister.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.490
No, this is a tongue twister.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.360
Stick out your tongue and
I'll show you how it works.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.360
No, that's okay.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.360
So, how does your watch work?

13:58.130 --> 13:59.160
Watch.

14:03.540 --> 14:06.410
Well, he doesn't need a watch.
He needs muscles.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.240
Muscles? No problem.
I can get you muscles like that.

14:18.420 --> 14:22.020
Uh, that's not the kind of muscles I meant.

14:22.060 --> 14:24.020
What other kind of mussels are there?

14:28.910 --> 14:30.880
That was an outrage.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.880
We were locked behind bars,
and Lexi just laughed at us.

14:33.920 --> 14:38.520
I know. That's why
I only tipped her 14%.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.520
Wow. Prison changed you.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.530
Wait!

14:46.570 --> 14:49.900
I know a new theme that Lexi
will absolutely despise!

14:49.940 --> 14:51.800
Even worse than prison.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.810
A place of misery and human suffering.

15:02.580 --> 15:05.780
Welcome to Hippo's Circus Cafe.

15:05.820 --> 15:09.520
Where the "F" from the health
department stands for fun!

15:10.560 --> 15:12.560
And also food poisoning.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.760
Would you like to try
the shish kebabs tonight?

15:26.610 --> 15:30.410
Uh, no thanks.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.750
I prefer food that hasn't been
in someone else's mouth yet.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.880
Well, then don't order
the gazpacho, either.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.820
Olive, I don't understand.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.590
Why would this be terrible for Lexi?

15:44.620 --> 15:45.790
That's why.

15:51.630 --> 15:53.500
I can only imagine the horrible things

15:53.530 --> 15:55.730
that will come out of that elephant.

15:58.570 --> 16:01.440
What's that glittering
in the elephant poop?

16:01.470 --> 16:04.510
Disgusto the Clown, will you
please pick this up for me?

16:14.620 --> 16:16.420
I found a diamond ring!

16:16.460 --> 16:18.730
This must be worth like $5,000.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.560
What the heck?

16:22.800 --> 16:26.470
Wait. Does this mean Lexi and
Disgusto are engaged now?

16:30.670 --> 16:35.840
I've had so much fun with Cameron.
Most male models are so stuck up and boring.

16:35.880 --> 16:39.410
Yes, well, Cameron is not
like most male models.

16:39.450 --> 16:40.450
At all.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.590
Don't worry.
He'll be here soon.

16:44.620 --> 16:48.490
He's just putting the finishing touches
on his ensemble for the big shoot.

16:48.530 --> 16:51.490
Okay, now that I understand
you wanted "muscles,"

16:52.830 --> 16:55.470
get ready for me to pump you up.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.680
Cool!
How do I look?

17:07.710 --> 17:08.780
Like you're wearing a bouncy house.

17:10.849 --> 17:12.750
By the way, you are.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.550
I made it from a bouncy house.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.619
This plan stinks!

17:18.660 --> 17:20.490
Did you get a whiff of that hippo?

17:20.530 --> 17:22.560
What hippo?
I only see an elephant.

17:22.589 --> 17:23.660
The dancing Hippo in the tutu.

17:29.730 --> 17:31.740
Don't get distracted.
We're here to torture Lexi,

17:31.770 --> 17:35.440
not watch disturbing yet strangely
compelling circus acts.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.510
Waitress!

17:38.540 --> 17:39.840
Can I get a drink over here?

17:40.840 --> 17:42.640
Coming right up.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.760
All right, that's it!
New plan.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.700
You know what elephants hate the most?

18:00.730 --> 18:03.630
Generalizations about
their likes and dislikes?

18:03.670 --> 18:05.730
No. Mice.

18:05.770 --> 18:07.840
Can you carve this roll
into the shape of a mouse?

18:07.870 --> 18:11.610
If I couldn't, what kind
of art prodigy would I be?

18:14.780 --> 18:16.480
Here.
Watch.

18:16.510 --> 18:18.750
This will wipe the smile
right off Lexi's face.

18:30.490 --> 18:34.630
Why would you taunt the elephant like that?
He's on a gluten-free diet.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.430
And I think I have an idea of how
you can pay for the damages.

18:43.870 --> 18:45.470
Okay, I don't.

18:45.510 --> 18:46.810
But I'll think of one.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.810
So, darling, while we're
waiting for Cameron,

18:51.850 --> 18:54.580
let me tell you about my
new line of beachwear

18:54.620 --> 18:57.550
that combines sun dresses with fun.

18:57.590 --> 18:59.450
Do you call them sundrefunses?

19:00.760 --> 19:03.760
No, that's ridiculous.
I call them f undresses.

19:05.460 --> 19:07.660
Sorry I'm late.

19:11.430 --> 19:12.830
I was working out.

19:12.870 --> 19:14.600
You don't get muscles like this

19:14.640 --> 19:17.510
by just inflating some balloon
suit under your clothes.

19:18.770 --> 19:21.540
Okay, I'm taking off my bandages.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.410
I want you to be the first thing I see.

19:29.780 --> 19:30.850
Wow.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.620
You are really
well-built.

19:37.460 --> 19:38.560
Thank you.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.760
Oops.

19:46.530 --> 19:47.530
Angus, do something!

20:08.660 --> 20:10.590
What just happened?

20:10.620 --> 20:14.690
Oh, nothing.
Your eyes must still be adjusting.

20:14.730 --> 20:17.860
Like, when you look at me, you
probably see a 12-year-old girl

20:17.900 --> 20:21.570
instead of a 40-something
queen of the fashion world.

20:23.470 --> 20:26.640
The doctor did say it would
take about half an hour

20:26.670 --> 20:28.840
for my vision to return to normal.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.740
Oh, well, it's only been...

20:40.820 --> 20:42.820
All right.
What's going on here?

20:43.920 --> 20:44.890
Okay.

20:46.860 --> 20:47.820
Here's the deal.

20:49.630 --> 20:51.760
Cameron saw you on that
Gossamer Jeans catalog

20:51.800 --> 20:53.800
and instantly fell in love with you.

20:53.830 --> 20:57.630
He was so in love that he imagined you
were his date to the school dance.

20:57.670 --> 20:59.940
Imagined? You mean
like a loony bird?

20:59.970 --> 21:02.610
Uh-huh!

21:02.640 --> 21:04.870
Everyone made fun of him,
and to cheer him up,

21:04.910 --> 21:08.580
I sang a song, which I'd be happy
to sing for you right now.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.620
Maybe some other time.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.650
The truth is Cameron's not a model.

21:17.660 --> 21:20.420
He's not 6'4".
He's not super buff.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.460
He's not classically handsome.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.460
He's not very smart.
You know what, just forget what he's not.

21:28.570 --> 21:30.830
What he is is the greatest guy I know.

21:34.940 --> 21:38.470
Vanessa, I'm sorry I lied to you.

21:38.510 --> 21:42.550
It's just you're so beautiful I was
willing to try anything to meet you.

21:42.580 --> 21:46.820
You made up this whole modeling gig?
I can't believe you.

21:46.850 --> 21:49.690
That's the craziest thing
anyone's ever done.

21:49.720 --> 21:53.460
I know.
It's also the most romantic.

21:55.590 --> 21:57.930
I'm sorry, did you say "romantic"?

21:57.960 --> 22:01.530
My ears are still ringing from
when my head hit the ceiling.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.540
And then the wall.

22:03.570 --> 22:05.740
And then the other wall.

22:05.770 --> 22:08.710
Nobody's ever gone through this
much trouble to impress me.

22:08.740 --> 22:10.680
Usually, guys just
do something really lame,

22:10.710 --> 22:13.680
like buy me a car or diamond earrings.

22:13.710 --> 22:17.550
I promise I will never, ever do that.

22:20.590 --> 22:21.890
That is so sweet.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.460
Really?
In that case,

22:24.490 --> 22:27.630
why don't we go out and get to
know each other a little better?

22:27.660 --> 22:29.660
Let me just go wash my hands first.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.830
For some reason my wrist
smells like rotten pineapple.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.910
Chyna, we did it!
She actually likes me!

22:39.940 --> 22:42.840
Of course she does.
I meant what I said.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.550
That I'm the greatest guy you know?

22:45.580 --> 22:48.850
Well, to be fair, I do not
know that many people.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.720
Shut up.
You love me.

22:54.860 --> 22:57.690
Hey, Cameron. I'm ready.
Let's go!

22:59.830 --> 23:01.590
Wow.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.740
Cameron might actually have a girlfriend.

23:04.230 --> 23:07.120
Did not see that coming.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.070
Or that.

23:12.270 --> 23:13.470
