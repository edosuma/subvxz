WEBVTT

00:19.686 --> 00:21.813
She's lying. President.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.526
It's the Russians. It's China. It's not--

00:26.735 --> 00:29.530
Yeah, but this is what
it'd feel like if it was true, right?

00:30.489 --> 00:32.991
I mean, we'd be sitting here
saying it's not possible.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.453
I think that's what we'd say
if it were really happening.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.830
Right?
I mean, that's what we're saying now.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.876
I mean, you got any idea
where they're taking us?

00:42.960 --> 00:45.295
They got a way more serious setup
up north.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.047
A whole town got hit.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.758
Get the pediatric stents ready.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.387
What?

00:54.221 --> 00:57.057
Radio said a school got hit by something.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.185
That's what they said, "something."

01:03.063 --> 01:05.190
Gummy worms? I'm more of a Skittles man.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.703
We need to turn around.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.163
-Stop.
-What are--

01:20.247 --> 01:21.582
-I need to stop.
-What?

01:21.665 --> 01:23.500
Hey. Stop the car.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.461
-Whoa, whoa.
-Hey. Hey, I need to turn around.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.338
-Can't turn around.
-I need to get back!

01:28.422 --> 01:30.841
-I can't turn around.
-I need to get back to them.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.051
Hello? Hello?

05:51.393 --> 05:53.520
Luke? Sarah?

06:03.947 --> 06:04.948
Ahmed?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.368
Luke? Sarah?

06:12.706 --> 06:13.832
Ahmed!

06:19.171 --> 06:20.172
Sarah?

06:21.757 --> 06:23.342
Ahmed!

08:38.184 --> 08:40.395
Stay on the beam. Don't talk.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.397
-Mom.
-Mommy.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.983
It's okay.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.611
I'm okay. I'm okay. I love you.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.571
I love you so much.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.867
-I'm scared.
-I love you so much. Mommy's here.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.577
We need to keep our voices down.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.871
-Mommy's here.
-Sure, okay.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.373
We thought you--

08:59.456 --> 09:01.625
No, no. I'm here. I'm here.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.461
I'll always be here.
I won't ever leave you.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.922
Quiet. Please!

09:08.757 --> 09:10.008
Okay. Okay. Okay.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.844
Sure. Okay.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.311
Hey.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.398
No. No, no, no.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.234
-Hey. Are you hurt?
-No, no, no. It's not mine.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.861
It's not mine.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.867
They wanna kill us,

09:36.201 --> 09:40.372
or take us to their ships.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.711
Where are their ships?

09:45.794 --> 09:48.797
No one's taking us.
No one's taking you from me.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.924
They could just want water, you know?

09:51.008 --> 09:55.596
The planet's mostly water, 70% water.
So they don't want us.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.973
They don't want us though.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.350
They just want water.
That's why they came.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.852
Then why's it here?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.855
They're here to take us. Why else--

10:04.938 --> 10:07.191
You've all seen too many movies.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.318
We don't know what it wants.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.153
We don't know if it wants anything.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.655
Well, whatever it is,
it's gonna find out the hard way

10:13.739 --> 10:15.824
we got the best military in the world.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.619
Is it the best military in the universe?

10:21.580 --> 10:22.706
Hey.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.293
You think I forgot?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.339
Here. Here.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.927
-No, thanks.
-Do I have to make you eat candy now?

10:35.010 --> 10:36.178
Hey, Luke, you want some?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.275
-It's the end of the world.
-Honey.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.152
It is, truly.

10:53.862 --> 10:54.863
Revelations.

10:56.114 --> 10:59.409
"Then I saw a new heaven and a new Earth.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.996
For the first heaven and the first Earth
passed away.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.375
And there's no longer any sea."

11:14.091 --> 11:16.468
There's not enough air in here.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.473
Something bad's gonna happen. I know it.

11:21.557 --> 11:22.766
-Mom?
-It's okay.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.060
Honey,
we have to try to keep ourselves together.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.312
-You're not listening to me!
-I am listening to you.

11:27.396 --> 11:30.732
Hey, hey. We need to all stay quiet, okay?

11:32.025 --> 11:35.779
You're a guest here!
What are you even doing here?

11:35.863 --> 11:37.739
Please. Please be quiet.

11:37.823 --> 11:40.284
Don't tell her to be quiet.

11:40.909 --> 11:44.746
They're drinking all the water.
There's no food.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.665
There's too many of them!

11:46.748 --> 11:48.709
-I want them out!
-Quiet, honey.

11:50.460 --> 11:54.006
Okay. We'll go. We'll go. Kids.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.883
Aneesha. No, we're not going.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.844
-Kids, Ahmed.
-No. No one's going anywhere.

11:58.927 --> 11:59.928
They are.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.139
We don't know what's out there.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.143
It's quieter now. We're gonna be fine.
Just-- If you can--

12:06.226 --> 12:08.145
No one's going anywhere.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.354
Okay.

12:09.438 --> 12:12.566
If you made a noise,
you'd put all our lives in danger.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.819
I can't have that.
We all stay here quietly.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.779
Thought it wasn't loaded.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.448
I said that not to scare you

12:19.531 --> 12:22.075
when you came knocking on my door
looking for your kid.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.036
I got two shells in here.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.581
I wasted one on that thing downstairs,
and I got 50 more.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.584
-Are you gonna shoot us?
-Okay. Everyone, just calm down.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.878
-Let them go.
-Don't be stupid.

12:32.961 --> 12:36.423
Firing that thing is gonna make more noise
than me and my kids tiptoeing out of here.

12:36.507 --> 12:37.758
Put it down.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.551
You're gonna lead it right to us,
you know that?

12:39.635 --> 12:40.636
Come on, kids.

12:40.719 --> 12:41.720
-No, no, no--
-Don't.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.680
Hey. Just leave her alone.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.394
No!

12:50.562 --> 12:52.523
Shit.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.738
Sarah.

13:11.583 --> 13:12.960
Come on.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.005
Please. Sweetheart.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.925
For Mommy. For Mommy. For Mommy, please.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.176
Please. Please.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.837
Help me.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.338
-Got you. I got you.
-Okay.

15:23.882 --> 15:26.009
Focus on me. I got you.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.928
Hang on.

15:29.221 --> 15:30.889
I got you.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.143
Honey! Honey!

15:35.227 --> 15:36.395
Honey!

15:37.062 --> 15:38.063
Honey!

15:38.689 --> 15:41.817
No! Help me! Please!

15:42.651 --> 15:43.652
No!

15:44.653 --> 15:48.198
Please. Hang on! Hang on!

15:48.282 --> 15:49.366
No!

15:54.496 --> 15:57.040
Don't let go.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.229
Careful.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.136
My heart won't stop beating so fast.

16:52.095 --> 16:57.559
Just breathe,
like wind rushing inside you. Okay?

17:00.354 --> 17:01.355
That hurts.

17:08.194 --> 17:12.031
My big girl, just breathe in.

17:12.950 --> 17:13.951
Breathe in.

17:18.372 --> 17:19.873
Like wind.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.165
Like wind.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.241
Where's Luke?

18:37.451 --> 18:39.828
Here. He's here.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.499
Where is it?

18:46.543 --> 18:47.878
In the dining room.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.257
Luke.

18:56.470 --> 18:57.513
Mom.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.768
Okay.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.063
Is it safe?

19:09.775 --> 19:11.902
Yes. Hurry. Hurry.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.155
Let's go.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.661
Move with me.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.207
Quiet.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.288
Come on. Just--

20:07.165 --> 20:08.208
Just breathe.

20:43.202 --> 20:44.369
This way.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.122
No, come here.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.249
No, we gotta go.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.294
No, it's too loud.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.681
We can run.

21:06.183 --> 21:07.184
We can run.

21:08.644 --> 21:09.728
It will hear you.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.658
Luke. Luke.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.494
Come-- Come here.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.667
No, you come to Mommy. Come here.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.424
Damn it.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.135
Are you okay? Are you okay?

23:10.265 --> 23:11.391
