welcome back to the Forge.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.731
Each of you has won
his respective competition

01:47.775 --> 01:50.150

a "Forged in Fire" champion.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.152
Now we want to see
who stands out

01:52.196 --> 01:53.862

another three rounds

01:53.906 --> 01:55.823
of edged weapon-making
competition

01:55.866 --> 01:59.201
specifically designed to push
your skills even further.

01:59.245 --> 02:01.328
And as usual,
at the end of each round,

02:01.372 --> 02:04.665
you will present your work
to our panel of expert judges:

02:04.708 --> 02:07.334
ABS Mastersmith
J. Neilson,

02:07.378 --> 02:10.379
historic weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker,

02:10.422 --> 02:13.215
Kali martial artist
Doug Marcaida.

02:13.259 --> 02:14.758
Ultimately, they decide
which of you

02:14.802 --> 02:17.052

champion of champions

02:17.096 --> 02:20.889

02:25.771 --> 02:27.855
This season,
our challenges are bigger

02:27.898 --> 02:29.398

02:29.441 --> 02:30.399

02:31.694 --> 02:34.528
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

02:34.572 --> 02:38.031
Each of you will have
a thin bar of high carbon steel

02:38.075 --> 02:40.325
and a length
of lower carbon steel.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.871
Your first round challenge
is to combine those two steels

02:43.914 --> 02:47.708
using an inlay technique
to forge a signature blade.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.668
Keep in mind
in the second round,

02:49.712 --> 02:51.753
you will have to craft a handle
and attach it to your blades,

02:51.797 --> 02:54.089
turning them into fully
functional weapons

02:54.133 --> 02:56.633
that will then be tested
in a rope slice,

02:56.677 --> 02:59.428
and hammering through
a 12-inch nail.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.722
- We need to inset
the high carbon steel

03:01.765 --> 03:03.307
into the round steel,

03:03.350 --> 03:05.726
<i> so you start by making</i>
<i> kind of a knife,</i>

03:05.769 --> 03:06.977

03:07.021 --> 03:08.395

making a knife.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.606
So it's quite a process.

03:10.649 --> 03:11.773
I'm terrified.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.150
- Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.289

so complicated?

03:27.333 --> 03:29.583
- It's the way
you proceed with it.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.168
When these guys
do their heat treat,

03:31.212 --> 03:33.003
if their welds
aren't set properly,

03:33.047 --> 03:35.756
they could literally pop that
whole high carbon steel edge

03:35.799 --> 03:36.882
right out of there
if the welds fail.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.675
- Golly.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.053
You will need to forge
a locomotive,

we give you enough steel.

If this knife actually works,

04:01.367 --> 04:02.950
this is gonna cut
somebody's hopes and dreams

04:02.993 --> 04:04.326

to the next round.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.245
- I'm about 12 inch.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.413
I'm assuming that's length,
not width,

04:08.457 --> 04:11.416

any of these 12 inches wide.

<i> and if I put a correct edge</i>

05:23.157 --> 05:27.200
it'll do all right
cutting through a big nail.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.037
- If you recall, Ben,
last season,

05:30.080 --> 05:33.123
did an inlay of softer steel

05:33.167 --> 05:35.500

05:35.544 --> 05:37.336
- And Ben can say,
"Been there, done that,"
