WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:00.640
A moving target is hard to hit.
 Even a wounded one.

00:03.840 --> 00:06.260
How do I compete with a doctor?
He's a doctor?

00:06.260 --> 00:07.750
He's a paediatrician.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.690
He puts his pants down
one leg at a time.

00:09.690 --> 00:11.900
Now I'm picturing him
with his pants off.

00:11.900 --> 00:14.830
How long has she been seeing him?
You sure she's seeing him?

00:14.830 --> 00:18.020
I have my suspicions.
You guys have an open relationship.

00:18.020 --> 00:20.470
I didn't think she'd do anything
   about it.

00:20.470 --> 00:23.640
So date somebody. Date twins.
Make her jealous.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.070
I can't date twins. I can't.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.280
I can't play games
   with her like that.

00:29.280 --> 00:33.430
I like her too much.
   I'm a one-woman man.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.890
What is that corny to you?

00:34.890 --> 00:37.840
I got a headache.
   Again?

00:43.460 --> 00:47.130
I hate getting my morning briefing
   from AM radio. What do we know?

00:47.130 --> 00:49.580
Just what you heard.
Wassermann is going public

00:49.580 --> 00:52.030
with his biggest round of
government secrets yet.

00:52.030 --> 00:53.490
At midnight tomorrow night.

00:53.490 --> 00:56.180
How did we get stuck being
the government's gatekeeper?

00:56.180 --> 00:58.150
No-one else is able to stop
   the leaks.

00:58.150 --> 01:01.560
Forgive my computer illiteracy
   but the man lives on the internet.

01:01.560 --> 01:02.540
Can't we track him?

01:02.540 --> 01:06.210
The same technology designed to
   protect you and I is protecting him.

01:06.210 --> 01:08.180
What's the Government's response?

01:08.180 --> 01:10.120
Actually they're debating it
   right now.

01:10.870 --> 01:14.540
"We're speaking with foreign affairs
   minister Diane Feeny this morning

01:14.540 --> 01:17.710
as well as her most vocal opponent
   on government transparency

01:17.710 --> 01:19.680
Dennis Thorpe."

01:19.680 --> 01:22.360
"This news is still breaking
   but what is your response

01:22.360 --> 01:24.810
to the pending release
   of classified documents?"

01:24.810 --> 01:27.740
"Wassermann would be nothing
more than a common criminal

01:27.740 --> 01:29.950
if it weren't for
the scope of his crimes."

01:29.950 --> 01:32.400
"We believe he's putting
this nation in danger."

01:32.400 --> 01:34.600
It's the Government's unwillingness
   to assess

01:34.600 --> 01:37.290
what needs to be classified
   that's putting us at risk.

01:37.290 --> 01:39.500
You agree with Wassermann's plan?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.680
Of course not
   but if our leaders operated

01:41.680 --> 01:43.890
with a responsible measured
   transparency

01:43.890 --> 01:47.560
men like Wassermann
   would run out of steam.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.240
Their kind thrive on the
   intransigence of politicians.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.440
When we come back we'll ask
   the minister

01:53.440 --> 01:56.130
what she thinks we should do
   with a man like Wassermann

01:56.130 --> 01:57.600
if and when he's apprehended.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.270
I just got an urgent e-mail
   about the minister.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.490
Let's take a look.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.880
"Keeping critical intelligence
out of enemy hands

02:06.880 --> 02:08.850
is more than a political imperative."

02:08.850 --> 02:11.060
"It's something
I feel passionate about."

02:17.660 --> 02:19.360
Wow. Is that?

02:19.360 --> 02:20.590
That's Diane.

02:20.590 --> 02:22.050
Shut the front door.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.020
We're going to have
   to cut this short.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.190
There's an urgent matter that
   requires the minister's attention.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.380
Excuse me.

02:30.380 --> 02:32.350
What is it? Is everything alright?

02:32.350 --> 02:35.760
No everything is definitely not
   alright.

02:40.170 --> 02:42.380
Could you just move to the left
   a little?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.440
That's a whole new meaning
to full disclosure.

02:51.670 --> 02:54.120
Where did you get this?
   It's viral.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.000 --> 03:11.730
Sergeant. Thank you for coming.

03:11.730 --> 03:14.660
I imagine it's good to be out of
   Ottawa after this morning.

03:14.660 --> 03:17.350
A moving target is hard to hit.
Even a wounded one.

03:17.350 --> 03:21.020
This is my husband Bruce.
And my aide Eileen Spalding.

03:21.020 --> 03:24.210
Is there somewhere
   we can speak in private?

03:24.210 --> 03:27.620
I'll be in the upstairs office.
This way.

03:30.070 --> 03:32.520
Alice if you wouldn't mind holding
   down the fort?

03:32.520 --> 03:34.240
Don't forget you have a one o'clock.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.930
IIB has been no interest
   in your personal affairs

03:36.930 --> 03:39.140
but if there was a criminal act
   perpetrated

03:39.140 --> 03:42.550
to force the Government's hand
   that's a national security matter.

03:42.550 --> 03:45.240
I understand.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.190
Was that tape
   your personal property?

03:48.190 --> 03:51.360
No I saw it for the first time
along with half the world.

03:51.360 --> 03:55.770
Had it been doctored in any way?
No that was me. In the flesh.

03:55.770 --> 03:58.220
You weren't even aware
   that tape existed.

03:58.220 --> 04:02.850
There isn't a doubt in my mind
that tape was made and released

04:02.850 --> 04:05.560
to embarrass me and our government.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.970
So you think it was politically
   motivated?

04:08.970 --> 04:12.400
Somebody's sending a message
about my stand on secrecy.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.840
Right now we're looking at
   a possible connection between this

04:15.840 --> 04:19.510
and Wassermann's agenda.
Got to admit I went there myself.

04:19.510 --> 04:23.420
Do you really think he was
responsible for this tape?

04:23.420 --> 04:26.590
That would be one way to neutralise
   your biggest critic overnight.

04:26.590 --> 04:29.780
And if it wasn't him we've got
   another threat to contend with.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.690
Want to know the big irony?

04:33.690 --> 04:38.080
My office logged over 500 calls.
Number one message "You go girl".

04:41.760 --> 04:44.470
Are you planning on returning
   to Ottawa?

04:44.470 --> 04:45.690
I have a press conference.

04:45.690 --> 04:48.380
But Bruce and I have some things
we need to work out.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.320
I understand.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.280
I need to reach
   the man on that tape with you.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.460
It's standard procedure
   in matters like this.

04:55.460 --> 04:58.890
I wouldn't have the faintest idea
how to find him.

04:58.890 --> 05:00.860
I don't even know his name.

05:03.550 --> 05:04.770
Oh.

05:04.770 --> 05:07.940
I think this is political sabotage.
   Someone is out to destroy her.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.390
The grenade lobbed
   to force her resignation.

05:10.390 --> 05:12.840
It's going to be hard to bounce back
   after this.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.280
It's no secret that Thorpe lobbied
   hard for the job

05:15.280 --> 05:18.210
and we all saw how
   he went after her this morning.

05:18.210 --> 05:21.160
There's no love lost.
   I'll give him a call.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.350
Let's find out who her lover
   on the tape was.

05:23.350 --> 05:28.000
See how much he knows.
   I'll co-ordinate with Metro.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.690
We really think Wassermann'd come
   out of his spider hole

05:30.690 --> 05:32.660
to make a sex tape?

05:32.660 --> 05:34.870
He thinks of himself
   as a serious journalist.

05:34.870 --> 05:38.540
Would he waste what credibility
   he thinks he has by going tabloid?

05:38.540 --> 05:39.500
I'm not buying it.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.680
She is speaking out against him.
   Maybe he's retaliating.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.380
If we don't stop him
   before midnight

05:45.380 --> 05:49.050
the next round of classified
   government documents will be leaked.

05:49.050 --> 05:51.740
If we can't get him directly
   maybe we can smoke out

05:51.740 --> 05:53.710
who's feeding him the secrets.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.790
"Almost 50 years ago one of our most
esteemed Prime Ministers'

06:00.790 --> 06:03.740
said the state has no place
in the bedrooms of the nation."

06:03.740 --> 06:07.150
"And while I acknowledge the hurt
my actions have caused my family

06:07.150 --> 06:09.120
I ask that you respect our privacy."

06:09.120 --> 06:12.040
Guy looks like he got hit
   by a two-by-four.

06:12.040 --> 06:16.200
Spouses always do.
   Jenny Spitzer. Hilary.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.150
I'm sorry guilty pleasure.
   I feel bad for the husband

06:19.150 --> 06:21.360
but I'm happy to see the tables
   turned for once.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.760
That's right.
   Women can stray the way men do.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.730
Does anyone think this is wrong?

06:26.730 --> 06:29.180
Who cares what she does
in her private life?

06:29.180 --> 06:32.350
She's the one always saying
   government has to keep secrets.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.300
This is not a state secret.
This is her private life.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.750
This is wrong.
   I got to agree with you.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.440
Come on. The reason the government
   is about secrets

06:40.440 --> 06:42.380
is not to protect us
   but to protect them.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.840
That makes sense too.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.650
(BOTH MUMBLE)

06:45.650 --> 06:46.800
Hi Sandy.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.480
That the guy?
   Dr Strongjaw.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.950
Smells like the ocean.

06:50.950 --> 06:54.860
People who live in glass houses -
   Should use their drapes.

06:54.860 --> 06:57.310
I don't care how public your life is

06:57.310 --> 07:00.240
no-one deserves to have their privacy
invaded like that.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.950
It's kind of a weird card
   for you to play.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.400
Nobody heard me.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.860
..as an Internet terrorist

07:06.860 --> 07:10.030
but he argues he's simply doing
   the work of a journalist.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.700
Is he held to the same standards
as you? Who checks his facts?

07:13.700 --> 07:17.610
Who vets his sources? Who is playing
fast and loose with people's lives?

07:17.610 --> 07:19.080
A lot of people are wondering

07:19.080 --> 07:21.040
have you apologised
   to your husband yet?

07:23.250 --> 07:26.660
This is an understandable distraction
for all of you.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.870
I only have myself to blame.

07:28.870 --> 07:34.000
But maybe when the dust settles
you'll try focusing on the real news.

07:38.420 --> 07:41.110
Sorry guys that's all the
   questions for today.

07:41.110 --> 07:43.560
We'll be issuing a statement later.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.480
Michelle McClusky IIB
   sorry I'm late.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.660
I don't have much time. Have a seat.
   I'll be quick.

07:50.660 --> 07:53.080
So what's the IIB want with me?

07:53.080 --> 07:55.800
I'm curious as to what you thought
   about the tape.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.200
Diane's foreign affair?
   It's regrettable.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.160
But I have to say she keeps herself
   in pretty good shape.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.100
Any idea who leaked it?

08:04.100 --> 08:06.790
You think someone hoped to
gain political advantage?

08:06.790 --> 08:09.740
Does she have any enemies
   apart from yourself?

08:09.740 --> 08:10.960
I'm hardly an enemy.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.890
We disagree politically
   but that goes with the territory.

08:13.890 --> 08:16.100
You wanted her job
   you lobbied hard for it.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.550
So I made a tape of her making
   the beast with two backs

08:18.550 --> 08:20.730
so I could take it?
   If it wasn't you who?

08:20.730 --> 08:23.180
Any number of people
   had a reason to embarass her.

08:23.180 --> 08:26.610
She's the face of the new Government
   Knows Best vision of the future.

08:26.610 --> 08:28.320
Which you so vigorously oppose.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.990
Secrets fester in the dark.
   Secrets breed corruption.

08:31.990 --> 08:34.700
I simply believe in the antiseptic
   power of sunshine.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.390
The truth will come out.
   I don't defend Wassermann

08:37.390 --> 08:40.320
but a more reasoned approach
   to secrecy is a good thing.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.000
If he's helping bring that about
   good on him.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.680
Diane's blind defence of government
   over-reach

08:46.680 --> 08:49.600
is a lot more of a threat
   than Wassermann.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.810
Now I have to go.

08:54.740 --> 08:56.710
Good luck.
   Thank you for your time.

08:57.690 --> 08:59.900
(DEV) I think Wassermann is losing
   support.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.080
Someone close to his camp
   sent us his picture.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.280
He operates because people
   sympathetic to his cause help him

09:05.280 --> 09:08.200
but there's a lot more people
   against him than for him.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.640
We set up an anonymous tip line
   and uploaded his picture.

09:11.640 --> 09:15.070
The million man posse
   a bit of a long shot isn't it?

09:15.070 --> 09:17.250
His network relies
   on cloud computing.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.200
It keeps it decentralised
   but means more points of contact.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.150
I'm looking for
   digital footprinting

09:22.150 --> 09:26.320
co-ordinating with Interpol
   on their last best leads.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.030
Clarke.

09:28.030 --> 09:31.460
You found him? That's fantastic.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.160
Wassermann?

09:33.160 --> 09:36.360
No but we do have an address
   on our Romeo.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.300
Let's find out if he's connected.

09:38.300 --> 09:41.230
Maybe he's been leaking
   more than just a sex tape.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.630
The guys have been through
   but they haven't found anything.

09:46.630 --> 09:48.570
You sure this is his place?
   Yeah.

09:48.570 --> 09:52.480
Last known address for Tyler Rooker
   her co-star on the tape.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.920
Looks like he hasn't been here
   for a while.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.120
And amongst these papers I found...

10:00.810 --> 10:04.240
..a cheque stub for a place
   called Moonlight Companions.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.950
Is that what it sounds like?

10:05.950 --> 10:08.160
It's one of the premier
   escort services.

10:08.160 --> 10:12.310
You know this how?
   I keep my ear to the ground.

10:12.310 --> 10:16.220
This cheque is for
   close to ten grand.

10:16.220 --> 10:22.100
This guy was definitely playing
   for pay. He was a hooker.

10:24.040 --> 10:24.280
Nobody heard me.

10:24.280 --> 10:24.520
..as an Internet terrorist

10:25.500 --> 10:28.190
We're at W -14 hours.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.640
The irony is people care more
   about the sex tape

10:30.640 --> 10:32.840
than they do
   about Wassermann's deadline.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.810
You got that right.
   How are we doing?

10:34.810 --> 10:38.480
I've narrowed the cloud he's on down
   to a few hundred digital signatures.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.410
Interpol data is still coming in.

10:41.410 --> 10:45.800
We're at 510 sightings so far.
   Two of them are possibilities.

10:47.770 --> 10:50.220
It's just a headache.
Everybody gets them.

10:50.220 --> 10:51.680
But then there's the flashes

10:51.680 --> 10:54.880
the white-outs the possible
   tie-in to your telepathy.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.300
It's not that bad.
   I'm going to order a CAT scan.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.750
It's not a big deal.
   Trust me.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.460
Besides it's probably nothing.
Then why bother?

11:02.460 --> 11:04.910
Because you're not like
   everyone else.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.850
Lord knows what's going on in
   your head

11:06.850 --> 11:09.780
and you said yourself you're using
   your gift more than ever.

11:09.780 --> 11:12.490
Got to go.
   IIB?

11:12.490 --> 11:15.420
That might be part of the problem
   burning it at both ends.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.480
I need you to tell me
   everything you can

11:23.480 --> 11:25.930
about the night
   you were caught on tape.

11:25.930 --> 11:30.590
It was about two months ago.
I met him at the Robson hotel.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.280
I'd just done 18 hours in the air.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.480
I needed a drink I couldn't sleep.

11:38.410 --> 11:43.070
And this handsome young guy
bought me a drink.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.190
I didn't know
why he gravitated to me.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.340
The room was full
of all these beautiful young women.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.490
He picked me. Out of all of them.

12:01.670 --> 12:02.890
He took me to his room.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.340
We made love.

12:12.420 --> 12:16.570
He left
and I never saw him again.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.540
Not bad for a broad past 40.

12:19.760 --> 12:23.440
What about paying him?
Excuse me?

12:23.440 --> 12:25.880
We know that Tyler Rooker
   was an escort.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.480
You didn't know?

12:42.520 --> 12:44.480
Am I the stupidest person
in the world?

12:44.480 --> 12:47.650
If it wasn't you who paid him?

12:47.650 --> 12:52.790
No money changed hands between us.

12:52.790 --> 12:56.220
They either paid him before the fact
or after.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.920
Do you have any idea who?

12:57.920 --> 13:00.370
I've made my share of enemies.

13:02.820 --> 13:06.010
I trust you can get him to admit
who hired him.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.640
We're still trying to locate him.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.610
I promise you we'll do everything
   we can

13:12.610 --> 13:15.060
to keep this
   as discreet as possible.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.210
That's some comfort.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.440
Thank you.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.110
That was strange.

13:24.110 --> 13:27.040
A couple of hours ago I was
defending her right to privacy

13:27.040 --> 13:28.520
and now I'm invading it.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.480
What did you get?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.930
Something I never expected
from a politician.

13:31.930 --> 13:33.160
The truth.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.590
She says what she's thinking.
She really didn't know.

13:36.590 --> 13:40.020
I've got to go to the EMS
if you need me call me.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.170
Where are you going?
   Escort agency.

13:44.170 --> 13:47.100
I'm hoping our Casanova knows
   where Wassermann is.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.810
Or maybe get us closer to the leaks.

13:49.810 --> 13:53.460
Escort agency. One of my lesser
   known sub-specialities.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.910
I'm good.
   Just stick with your 500 tips.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.560
I got stuff to do anyway.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.370
Michelle McClusky IIB.
   We spoke on the phone.

14:21.370 --> 14:25.280
I have a couple of questions for you
   about Tyler Rooker.

14:25.280 --> 14:29.440
Yes. He worked here.
Maybe three or four days a month.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.640
Is there anything you can tell me
   about him?

14:31.640 --> 14:33.350
He was a good guy.

14:33.350 --> 14:37.020
Not going to cure cancer
but he's a sweet kid.

14:37.020 --> 14:39.710
You think it's possible he may have
   leaked the tape.

14:39.710 --> 14:43.620
Oh I seriously doubt it.
I know a little of his family.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.830
From the prairies
his dad's a minister.

14:45.830 --> 14:47.800
He would not want them
to know about this.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.710
Maybe he needed the money.
No he was one of our top earners.

14:51.710 --> 14:54.160
Do you have any idea where he is?
No.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.830
I really need to speak with him.
He hasn't been reachable.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.530
Not to me not to anyone.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.980
If he calls
I will tell him you're asking.

15:01.980 --> 15:06.130
Is there anyone else here who knows
   who was using his services?

15:06.130 --> 15:08.340
I can't stop them from talking
to each other

15:08.340 --> 15:12.250
but Diane Feeny
is not our first public figure.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.180
What I sell here isn't sex.
It's confidentiality.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.630
I'm going to need to see
   a list of clients.

15:17.630 --> 15:21.060
I'm going to need to see a warrant.

15:21.060 --> 15:22.520
OK.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.660
Absolutely.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.330
You're sure its him.
   It's Wassermann?

15:31.330 --> 15:34.520
Thank you.
   Looks like the posse came through.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.730
He had a backlash
   since his last announcement.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.680
Two people called in
   the same sighting.

15:38.680 --> 15:39.900
We have an address.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.070
Confirmed. It's Wassermann.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.800
I got him.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.580
Mr Wassermann.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.760
I'm going to have to take you
   into custody.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.970
I'll be out in 24 hours
   maybe less.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.780
You're jealous really.

16:42.780 --> 16:45.470
I'm not jealous.
   I'm totally fine with this.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.920
And he's touching her.
   It doesn't bother me.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.120
He could paw at her
   like a mountain lion.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.330
It doesn't bother me at all.

16:52.330 --> 16:54.780
Are you ready?
Come here.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.650
Honestly I've been doing great.
I feel good.

16:59.650 --> 17:03.080
No headaches no flashes.
Everything is going good.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.290
Then you have nothing
   to worry about.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.760
It scares me a little bit.

17:09.950 --> 17:13.359
Now that we have Wassermann we have
   to figure out how to hold him.

17:13.359 --> 17:16.790
If we could prove he actively
   solicited classified material.

17:16.790 --> 17:20.700
Do you think he could still be
   behind Diane's sexpose?

17:20.700 --> 17:23.150
We can't rule him out.
   Any luck finding her boy toy?

17:23.150 --> 17:26.339
We have teams interviewing
   his co-workers and friends.

17:26.339 --> 17:29.030
Toby is minutes away.
   Good.

17:29.030 --> 17:31.960
I don't want to sound cynical
   but her husband Bruce

17:31.960 --> 17:34.640
hasn't wavered in his support
   for her for one moment.

17:35.870 --> 17:38.080
That's a man
   you just don't find any more.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.270
That's exactly my point.
   Right.

17:41.270 --> 17:44.680
I'll get Dev to do a background
   check on him and his staff.

17:46.140 --> 17:49.090
I'm surprised you didn't request
   a lawyer Mr Wassermann.

17:49.090 --> 17:50.080
I don't trust them.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.500
I guess living in the shadowy
   world of espionage

17:52.500 --> 17:54.950
trust is the first casualty.

17:54.950 --> 17:59.120
No the first casualty is truth.
   Everybody knows that.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.070
I think the saying applies to war.

18:01.070 --> 18:04.020
I am at war. With the government.

18:04.020 --> 18:07.430
I'm in the business of exposing
   their lies. Their hypocrisy.

18:07.430 --> 18:11.100
Their secret sex tapes?
   I didn't do that.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.790
But I applaud whoever did.

18:13.790 --> 18:16.240
The public has a right to know
   the conduct

18:16.240 --> 18:17.700
of the people they put in office.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.130
I thought you were interested
   in exposing things that mattered

18:21.130 --> 18:24.560
not people's personal affairs.

18:26.510 --> 18:29.460
Is this Wassermann?
   It is.

18:29.460 --> 18:32.630
Right but you have
   no problem exposing documents

18:32.630 --> 18:35.320
that could put people's lives
   at risk.

18:35.320 --> 18:39.250
Do you recognise this soldier?
   Should I?

18:39.250 --> 18:43.400
He was killed 16 hours after you
   identified him as an operative.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.320
It's terrible with the family.
   You're missing the point.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.520
Who provided you
   with those documents?

18:49.520 --> 18:51.230
People of conscience.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.200
Where did you get the documents?

18:53.200 --> 18:56.360
Even if I knew I'd never give up
   a source.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.070
Right.

19:10.070 --> 19:12.280
You consider yourself a journalist.

19:12.280 --> 19:18.160
No journalists for the most are
   the stooges of the multinationals.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.840
I am not in anybody's pocket.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.550
You're not walking away with this.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.740
We'll see won't we?

19:33.560 --> 19:37.960
He met someone in a car and they
passed a memory stick of some kind.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.910
Male female? I didn't see.
   You didn't see or he didn't see?

19:40.910 --> 19:42.370
I didn't get a good read.

19:42.370 --> 19:44.320
You did see a memory stick.
Yeah.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.750
What's going on with you?
   Are you OK?

19:47.750 --> 19:50.680
I'm fine.
   You don't look very well.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.880
I'm good.

19:53.870 --> 19:54.850
I gotta go.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.520
I appreciate your concern.

20:04.380 --> 20:07.070
We need a warrant
   to search Wasserman's place.

20:07.070 --> 20:10.260
Based on what?
   A feverish telepath's read?

20:10.260 --> 20:11.720
He saw a memory stick.

20:11.720 --> 20:15.160
We tell the judge that the evidence
   is in danger of being destroyed.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.360
I guess Judge Galliano
   still owes you one.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.550
We're running out of time.
   Speaking of which

20:19.550 --> 20:22.500
Diane Feeny just called
   an impromptu press conference.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.190
Can you put it up?
   Yeah.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.650
"At 12:45 this afternoon

20:26.650 --> 20:30.080
members of IIB apprehended
   and detained Gregory Wasserman."

20:30.080 --> 20:33.250
"As you are aware Wasserman
   had been waging a one-man campaign

20:33.250 --> 20:34.980
to expose government documents."

20:34.980 --> 20:37.670
Efforts that pose a security risk
   to all Canadians.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.130
Why is she doing this?

20:39.130 --> 20:42.560
Maybe she figures catching a
   terrorist trumps a romp in the sack.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.490
"His brazen contempt
   for diplomatic confidentiality

20:45.490 --> 20:48.660
underscores the fact that
   he's more interested in showboating

20:48.660 --> 20:51.370
than the public's rights."
   She should be laying low.

20:51.370 --> 20:53.560
What's your response
   to the Prime Minister

20:53.560 --> 20:55.760
calling for your resignation?
   Excuse me?

20:55.760 --> 20:58.210
I'm just getting the release
   out of Ottawa.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.480
There you have it.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.330
The rise and fall of Diane Feeny.

21:07.590 --> 21:07.830
"And while I acknowledge the hurt
my actions have caused my family

21:09.800 --> 21:12.480
I don't back down from a fight.
   I can see that.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.650
If I step down the PM will appoint
   Thorpe. I won't let that happen.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.840
Foreign affairs is not the
   department for on the job training.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.550
Are you sure that's a good idea?

21:20.550 --> 21:22.520
Must be bored of
   taking the graceful exit.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.720
There's nothing graceful
   about politics.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.410
It's clumsy it's messy
   and it's all we've got.

21:27.410 --> 21:30.340
Not fighting for my job
   I'm fighting to save my country

21:30.340 --> 21:34.010
from men like Wasserman.
   What about the tape?

21:34.010 --> 21:36.220
I was set up.
   I don't think it's personal.

21:36.220 --> 21:37.680
They just want me out of the way.

21:37.680 --> 21:42.340
Is there any way that Rooker
   could have had access to your files?

21:42.340 --> 21:45.030
I didn't have anything sensitive
   with me.

21:45.030 --> 21:48.200
Ten years ago
   Bruce asked me to give all this up.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.400
It's days like this
   where I wish I had.

21:51.630 --> 21:53.840
How am I ever gonna make it up
   to him?

21:58.470 --> 22:01.660
Mr Thorpe can we get a quote?
   It's a slippery slope.

22:01.660 --> 22:04.830
"We give our elected officials
   the unbridled power of kings."

22:04.830 --> 22:06.560
"They think they're royalty."

22:06.560 --> 22:08.760
"All the entitlement
   all the paternalism."

22:08.760 --> 22:11.450
"Ms Feeny should do
   the honourable thing and resign."

22:11.450 --> 22:14.620
How can you listen to this claptrap?
   Sorry.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.350
If the hardliners side with Feeny

22:16.350 --> 22:18.800
they could draft
   a non-confidence motion.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.720
Are you saying the current government
could fall? Exactly.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.380
You've got to give her credit.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.070
Diane Feeny has got stones.
   (CHUCKLES)

22:29.070 --> 22:30.530
I never doubted it.

22:30.530 --> 22:33.220
It's not every day someone says no
   to the Prime Minister.

22:33.220 --> 22:35.670
Yeah well she's got
   the support of her party.

22:35.670 --> 22:38.360
She's not gonna step down.
   What about everyone else?

22:38.360 --> 22:40.060
Not so much.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.370
Hey Oz. You see Liv?

22:49.370 --> 22:51.320
Er no I haven't.
Alright.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.270
You do you let her know
I'm looking for her OK?

22:54.270 --> 22:57.440
Everything OK?
Yeah. I just got to hear from her.

23:07.230 --> 23:08.690
Hey.
   Hey.

23:08.690 --> 23:10.420
How's it going?
   Good. How are you?

23:10.420 --> 23:13.590
Good. Just working on this report.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.800
I was thinking something.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.480
You know this thing
   where we're seeing other people

23:18.480 --> 23:21.680
I'm fine with that. It's a good idea
   for us to keep it casual right?

23:21.680 --> 23:22.880
Yeah.

23:22.880 --> 23:26.070
Yeah but I was thinking if
   either of us is gonna see somebody

23:26.070 --> 23:29.260
maybe as a rule
   we could tell each other.

23:29.260 --> 23:32.430
Because that way
   there's not so much confusion.

23:32.430 --> 23:36.100
That's a reasonable thing to ask
   right?

23:36.100 --> 23:38.550
Yeah sure.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.490
So are you seeing anybody or...?

23:40.490 --> 23:44.160
Have you been spying on me?
   No.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.370
Good. I don't like spies.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.700
Hey.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.680
Hi.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.870
Sorry I didn't see you there.
No.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.820
You er get the results?

24:00.820 --> 24:03.750
No. I have been so swamped
   I haven't had a chance.

24:03.750 --> 24:06.920
OK. Well when you do just...

24:06.920 --> 24:08.880
I promise I'll let you know.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.870
OK.

24:22.350 --> 24:25.280
Should we be surprised?
   Because Wasserman exposes secrets

24:25.280 --> 24:28.470
doesn't mean he can't keep them.
   We searched his entire place.

24:28.470 --> 24:30.410
No memory stick?
   I have to talk to Toby.

24:30.410 --> 24:32.860
You wasted a chance
   to take a real run at Wasserman

24:32.860 --> 24:35.550
based on Logan's what?
   His intuition laying on of hands?

24:35.550 --> 24:38.000
He might have it hidden.
   We could still find it.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.680
I can't hold him while you go on
   a fishing expedition.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.650
What are we supposed to do?

24:43.880 --> 24:47.310
Unless we want to risk
   contaminating a future prosecution

24:47.310 --> 24:49.250
we have to let him go.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.670
But if I was you I wouldn't
   let him out of your sight.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.990
Hey.
   Hey.

25:00.990 --> 25:03.200
You let Wasserman go?
   We had to.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.400
We have no evidence.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.610
Are you are absolutely sure
   what you saw? Yes.

25:07.610 --> 25:10.540
But you couldn't tell
   who the whistle blower was. No.

25:10.540 --> 25:14.450
All I saw was they gave Wasserman an
envelope with the data device in it.

25:14.450 --> 25:17.380
We have to find Rooker.
   That sex tape wasn't random.

25:17.380 --> 25:20.330
Whoever hired him
   could also be behind the leaks.

25:20.330 --> 25:22.540
Alright. Let me help you find Rooker.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.920
I feel like we're pushing you
   too hard. No you're not pushing.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.860
Are you trying to prove something
   Toby?

25:29.860 --> 25:32.810
No. Do I have to?
   I mean to yourself.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.500
No.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.800
Someone coming. Time to go honey.

25:57.030 --> 25:58.730
Hi.
Hey how are you doing?

25:58.730 --> 26:01.420
If you need an application
   we're always on the lookout.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.630
No I'm here for a companion.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.600
Well you've come to
   the right place.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.760
We've got a lot of great girls.
   What's your type?

26:08.760 --> 26:10.490
I'm looking for a guy.

26:10.490 --> 26:12.200
OK.
For my wife.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.630
Right. I have to ask
   is she good with this?

26:15.630 --> 26:17.840
She is good with it.
She sent me here.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.800
Oh yeah?

26:18.800 --> 26:22.230
She wants that guy you know
the guy from the video.

26:22.230 --> 26:24.920
Online right now.
The sex video that's going around.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.380
Yeah.
Yeah.

26:26.380 --> 26:30.290
I'm sorry. I couldn't get hold of
   him even if I wanted to.

26:32.020 --> 26:34.710
'And you couldn't afford him
   anyway.'

26:34.710 --> 26:37.160
You don't know where he is?
   No I'm sorry.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.830
Can I double his rate?
How about that?

26:40.830 --> 26:43.040
You must really love your wife.

26:45.220 --> 26:48.410
We got to one of Wasserman's
   lieutenants as I was telling you.

26:48.410 --> 26:51.100
We just intercepted a call
   between him and Wasserman.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.800
The call was too brief to be traced.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.490
But they've been following him
   for the last 45.

27:06.590 --> 27:08.720
It's Diane's husband.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.870
Waiting for me?

27:12.870 --> 27:15.320
They made the transfer. Let's go.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.990
Don't move.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.810
Mrs Feeny you can't go in there.
   He's my husband.

27:26.810 --> 27:29.500
He's a person under suspicion.
   He would never do this.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.690
Did he have access to your files?

27:32.690 --> 27:34.400
Yes. But -

27:34.400 --> 27:36.840
They were found in
   Bruce's possession.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.800
He was caught in the act of
   passing them off to Wasserman.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.240
I'm sorry.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.710
Please.

27:43.710 --> 27:46.400
We have the names
   contact numbers and safe houses

27:46.400 --> 27:49.320
of three CSIS agents in Cairo.
I don't know anything about it.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.770
Here's an memo suggesting
   we continue to support

27:51.770 --> 27:54.720
the military dictatorship.
I have never seen any of this.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.410
I want to speak to my wife.
   She doesn't want to talk to you.

27:57.410 --> 28:00.820
You gave these files to Wasserman.
I gave a portfolio to a courier.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.030
And you had no idea
   what was in that portfolio?

28:03.030 --> 28:05.960
Architectural drawings.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.400
I would never do this to my wife.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.890
Never.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.610
We caught him with the memory stick.

28:22.610 --> 28:24.560
What's he saying?
That he knows nothing.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.240
We downloaded some of it.
   If it had seen the light of day.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.960
Toby called. He wants you
   to meet him at the Ibar Hotel.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.380
He says it's important.
   OK.

28:32.380 --> 28:33.870
What do you want me to do with him?

28:33.870 --> 28:36.050
Hold on to him
   for as long as possible.

28:46.670 --> 28:47.810
Toby?

28:47.810 --> 28:49.520
Come in.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.930
I was looking for Toby Logan.

28:53.930 --> 28:57.100
You must be his wife Michelle.
   I'm Tyler.

28:57.100 --> 28:59.310
Maybe I should be paying you.

29:01.720 --> 29:01.960
Nobody heard me.

29:01.960 --> 29:02.230
..as an Internet terrorist

29:05.640 --> 29:07.600
So how much did you get
   for that tape?

29:07.600 --> 29:09.810
I didn't get anything.
   I didn't know about it.

29:09.810 --> 29:12.260
I didn't want that to get out.
Really?

29:12.260 --> 29:15.930
I'd think a guy in your position can
capitalise on something like this.

29:15.930 --> 29:19.340
You don't get it. This cost me
   just as much as it cost that woman.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.550
No-one in my family
   will even speak to me.

29:21.550 --> 29:24.240
Who paid you to sleep with Diane?
   Was it Wasserman?

29:24.240 --> 29:25.940
I never heard of the guy.

29:35.090 --> 29:37.200
It must be the same watch.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.420
(GROANS SOFTLY)

29:38.420 --> 29:42.360
Got to be the same person
that was with Wasserman.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.060
Are you sure?

29:45.520 --> 29:47.230
Yeah.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.630
So what's our next move?

29:52.630 --> 29:53.850
We have to let him go.

29:53.850 --> 29:56.780
He's coming back in the morning
   for formal questioning.

29:56.780 --> 29:59.470
We're holding Wasserman
   and we've shut him down.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.590
Mr Feeny you're free to go.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.960
I never did any of this.
   I know that.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.600
But whoever did do this find them.

30:19.050 --> 30:22.460
Get me everything you've dug up
   on her husband and his staff.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.340
Excuse me.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.800
Hi.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.000
Mr Feeny left his day planner here.
   I wonder if I could pick it up?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.200
I guess with everything
   going on with his wife

30:35.200 --> 30:36.910
he's a little scattered.

30:36.910 --> 30:39.840
Brilliant architect
   but perpetually disorganised.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.030
If I didn't keep track of his stuff
   he'd ever get anything done.

30:43.030 --> 30:45.720
That's a nice watch.
   Thanks.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.660
I've seen one like that before.

30:50.850 --> 30:54.020
Do you help him out with
   his business meetings as well?

30:54.020 --> 30:55.000
Of course.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.440
He was just in the interrogation
   room. Maybe you should look there.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.120
Toby do you want to show her
   the way in? Yeah.

31:03.330 --> 31:04.800
This way.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.590
Thanks.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.480
Found it.
   Oh good.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.190
Do you have a couple of minutes?

31:21.190 --> 31:23.400
I just have a few questions
   about your boss.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.600
Yeah I've got a couple minutes.
   Good.

31:27.310 --> 31:30.240
So how long have you worked
   for Bruce?

31:30.240 --> 31:32.200
Erm two years.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.130
And you have access
   to his computers?

31:35.130 --> 31:36.860
It's part of the job of course.

31:36.860 --> 31:40.030
And he probably has access
   to his wife's right? Yes.

31:40.030 --> 31:43.220
I'm guessing a smart woman like
   yourself would have no problem

31:43.220 --> 31:46.150
taking a peek from time to time.

31:46.150 --> 31:48.840
Are you really trying
   to put this on me?

31:48.840 --> 31:51.760
It was Bruce. He was passing
   government secrets to Wasserman.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.960
You know Wasserman?
   Er yeah I know the name.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.420
Who doesn't?

31:56.420 --> 31:59.610
What do you think
   about what he's trying to do?

31:59.610 --> 32:01.800
I think...

32:01.800 --> 32:05.230
..the government should
   serve the people not rule them.

32:05.230 --> 32:09.640
Well that is exactly what Dennis
   Thorpe thinks almost word for word.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.330
You know Diane she hates him.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.280
What do you think about Diane?

32:14.280 --> 32:16.240
I like her well enough.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.450
Her politics?
   I don't know.

32:18.450 --> 32:21.620
I leave politics
   to the professionals.

32:21.620 --> 32:27.000
Hmm. But didn't you do post grad
   work in international law?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.950
In fact your faculty adviser
   was Dennis Thorpe

32:29.950 --> 32:32.130
the man lobbying for Diane's job.

32:32.130 --> 32:33.620
That was a long time ago.

32:33.620 --> 32:36.070
'Stay calm. She doesn't know.'

32:44.610 --> 32:47.800
"She set up the camera.
She's the one."

32:47.800 --> 32:50.250
You set up that camera.

32:50.250 --> 32:52.200
Diane needed to be gotten rid of

32:52.200 --> 32:55.630
and when the sex tape didn't work
   you pinned it on her husband.

32:55.630 --> 32:58.320
She would never survive
   that politically.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.080
She shouldn't even be there OK?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.210
She's the face of repression.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.420
Did Dennis Thorpe say that too?

33:05.420 --> 33:08.110
He's a great man.

33:08.110 --> 33:10.800
He's gonna be Prime Minister
   one day.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.000
You were ready to spill
   your country's secrets

33:13.000 --> 33:14.710
over a schoolgirl crush.

33:14.710 --> 33:16.170
It was not a crush.

33:16.170 --> 33:18.620
I believe in what I did
   for democracy.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.170
I want to say thank you.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.620
Getting Wasserman
   was pretty great for us too.

33:30.620 --> 33:33.790
I have to say this debate
   about government transparency

33:33.790 --> 33:35.520
isn't gonna end with him.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.680
You know the next Wasserman
   is out there just waiting to pounce.

33:38.680 --> 33:42.860
I hope we can survive whoever
   that is. You're still standing.

33:42.860 --> 33:45.550
Maybe Bruce and I can now
   put our lives back together.

33:45.550 --> 33:48.000
I'm sure you guys
   are gonna be just fine.

34:08.540 --> 34:11.230
So it's officially driving me crazy.
   What is that?

34:11.230 --> 34:13.679
You and the doctor there.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.120
I just gotta know.
Are you seeing him?

34:16.120 --> 34:18.090
(SIGHS) Yes.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.040
You are?

34:20.040 --> 34:22.239
Is it serious?

34:22.239 --> 34:25.409
Yeah.
OK.

34:25.409 --> 34:28.600
Yeah. Great then what's an EMS
got over a paediatrician?

34:28.600 --> 34:31.050
Probably gives you free lollipops
all the time.

34:31.050 --> 34:33.020
He's not a paediatrician.
   He's an OB-GYN.

34:33.020 --> 34:35.199
I can't believe you thought
   I was dating him.

34:35.199 --> 34:38.400
You're not?
   No. I'm seeing him as a patient.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.100
I don't understand.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.250
I wanted to see
   if I could have a baby.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.219
What?

34:46.219 --> 34:49.150
You're trying to have a...
   ..baby yes.

34:49.150 --> 34:52.580
Not that I have immediate plans.
   I just you know...

34:52.580 --> 34:54.040
I wanted to know is all.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.770
So what's the verdict?

34:55.770 --> 34:57.720
I'm actually pretty pumped.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.160
I have the uterus of a 25-year-old.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.370
That's great. Good.

35:02.370 --> 35:03.600
Me too.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.060
I'm pumped for you.

35:05.060 --> 35:07.270
I don't have a uterus obviously.
   Yeah.

35:07.270 --> 35:10.200
You know that.
   (LAUGHS)

35:10.200 --> 35:12.160
I'm gonna go.
   Yeah you should go.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.090
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

35:17.300 --> 35:19.240
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

35:23.420 --> 35:25.600
(KNOCKING)

35:25.600 --> 35:27.330
Come in.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.320
Hey. I thought you weren't home.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.950
No I'm here.

35:32.950 --> 35:34.920
How are you doing?
   I'm OK.

35:34.920 --> 35:37.600
You want anything?
I can grab you a beer or something.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.770
No thanks.
   I actually have to talk to you.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.500
Here.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.910
Results from your MRI and CT scan.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.720
Cool.

35:47.720 --> 35:51.070
What are you afraid to just tell me?

35:51.070 --> 35:54.240
Well your brain shows
   no obvious signs of anomalies.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.220
That's great.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.430
These headaches
   that you've been having

35:57.430 --> 35:59.880
are linked to
   intense electrical activity.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.820
Neurology has never seen anything
   like it.

36:01.820 --> 36:04.270
Not that they've ever had
   a patient like you.

36:04.270 --> 36:08.420
Alright so I'm unique right?
Is it serious?

36:08.420 --> 36:11.370
Actually
   these intense electrical storms

36:11.370 --> 36:14.060
are precursors
   to some pretty powerful strokes.

36:14.060 --> 36:16.510
You're pushing your brain
   to its stress limit.

36:16.510 --> 36:20.180
Alright.
So I guess I have to switch to decaf.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.710
This is no joke Toby.

36:22.710 --> 36:25.080
Every time you overexert your mind

36:25.080 --> 36:29.470
you engage in repeated
   and prolonged use of your telepathy

36:29.470 --> 36:32.160
it's dangerous.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.200
Alright I will slow down. I got it.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.330
No I don't think you do.

36:37.530 --> 36:40.240
What I'm trying to tell you
   isn't that it might

36:40.240 --> 36:42.690
I'm trying to say
   that it will kill you.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.000
It's all in here.
