00:00.428 --> 00:02.115
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...

00:02.141 --> 00:03.624
I'm having nightmares!

00:03.648 --> 00:04.936
Someone is gonna die!

00:05.529 --> 00:06.904
If I hadn't remembered on my own,

00:06.929 --> 00:08.600
would you have told me what we lost?

00:08.625 --> 00:10.014
You didn't need to know.

00:10.039 --> 00:12.459
The Witness is your son.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.193
It's not your fault.

00:14.218 --> 00:16.998
If there's something wrong
with him, he got it from me.

00:19.281 --> 00:21.912
- We can change things.
- You mean him?

00:21.937 --> 00:23.272
Do you think you can save him?

00:24.609 --> 00:25.896
Is my brother troubling you?

00:25.921 --> 00:27.194
I want to help.

00:27.219 --> 00:29.396
Stop time's cruel destruction.

00:29.421 --> 00:30.436
Agh!

00:30.461 --> 00:31.483
Gale!

01:00.730 --> 01:02.541
- Your time has come!
- No, no!

01:02.566 --> 01:03.886
Stop!

01:08.808 --> 01:10.575
What the hell kind of tip is this, Gale?

01:10.610 --> 01:12.276
Came down the wire 20 minutes ago.

01:12.312 --> 01:15.284
Just move your ass. I haven't
got time to walk you through it.

01:21.254 --> 01:22.620
Suite with the light. I'm going in.

01:22.655 --> 01:24.191
Cover my rear.

01:24.724 --> 01:26.357
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, Gale.

01:26.392 --> 01:28.025
This is that monkey
bullshit again, isn't it?

01:28.061 --> 01:30.166
No bullshit. Trust me.

01:31.432 --> 01:33.063
FBI! Nobody move!

01:34.400 --> 01:36.665
Aw, hell. He said he paid for the room.

01:39.504 --> 01:41.238
Oh, shit.

01:41.274 --> 01:42.706
Shit.

01:42.731 --> 01:44.134
Shit!

01:45.578 --> 01:47.049
Oh.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.932
You know, not every nefarious character

01:48.964 --> 01:50.397
that comes in and out of this hotel

01:50.432 --> 01:53.133
is in your secret society of monkeys.

01:53.168 --> 01:55.135
Room 608.

01:55.170 --> 01:56.735
It was close enough.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.338
Christ.

01:58.958 --> 02:00.524
What are my odds you're
not gonna tell anybody

02:00.549 --> 02:01.875
down at the Bureau about this?

02:01.910 --> 02:05.445
Oh, it is my duty as a
special agent of the FBI...

02:05.819 --> 02:07.486
to report the heroics of my partner

02:07.511 --> 02:09.401
as accurately as possible.

02:10.447 --> 02:13.143
Oh, brighten up, sunshine.

02:13.168 --> 02:14.838
Any day you bust through a door

02:14.863 --> 02:16.712
and find a guy getting his jollies off

02:16.737 --> 02:19.823
instead of catching
some commie's bullet...

02:19.867 --> 02:21.900
it's a good day.

02:31.057 --> 02:32.557
It happens.

02:32.582 --> 02:35.547
The IRT is switching out
the wiring on 3rd Avenue.

03:00.119 --> 03:02.607
Holy shit.

03:04.490 --> 03:07.711
I guess Santa brought me
coal for Christmas after all.

03:08.071 --> 03:09.771
We need your help.

03:12.509 --> 03:13.907
Okay.

03:39.454 --> 03:41.118
Cassie...

03:50.294 --> 03:51.789
Hey?

03:53.860 --> 03:55.817
No, I was just saying

03:55.853 --> 03:58.353
it's nice to see you're
still keeping your brother

03:58.388 --> 04:00.288
out of trouble.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.813
What would I do without her?

04:01.838 --> 04:04.806
Still working on that
clean shave, too, I see.

04:05.195 --> 04:07.162
I tried.

04:07.197 --> 04:09.044
Wish I could say it
was good to see you two,

04:09.069 --> 04:10.365
but I'm not so sure.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.367
I almost got shit-canned from the Bureau

04:12.402 --> 04:14.369
after what happened in '44.

04:14.404 --> 04:17.208
They passed my report
about time travelers around

04:17.233 --> 04:19.241
like it was the funny papers.

04:21.144 --> 04:22.686
This, um...

04:23.814 --> 04:26.248
this Army of the 12 Monkeys.

04:26.283 --> 04:29.184
I've looked for it every day,

04:29.219 --> 04:31.219
and I can't find it.

04:32.944 --> 04:34.348
Look at this.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.049
- What's this?
- A document from the future.

04:40.074 --> 04:41.563
It details their origin.

04:41.598 --> 04:43.846
It's written by their prophet.

04:45.335 --> 04:48.057
A man who calls himself the Witness.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.409
"The First Gathering of the Faithful."

04:54.444 --> 04:57.215
Every religion needs a congregation.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.247
We think theirs starts now in...

04:59.283 --> 05:02.183
"Hope Valley. 1953.

05:02.219 --> 05:05.186
"Winter of Ash and Blood."

05:06.723 --> 05:08.223
Ash and blood?

05:08.258 --> 05:10.059
Help us track him down.

05:10.084 --> 05:12.480
Before he even gets off the
ground, before the plague,

05:12.505 --> 05:14.505
before the messengers, before...

05:15.465 --> 05:17.067
all of it.

05:17.957 --> 05:20.971
Attorney General keeps a list
of Subversive Organizations.

05:20.996 --> 05:22.563
It gets longer every day.

05:22.588 --> 05:24.021
Not just political.

05:24.056 --> 05:26.395
Religious. Cults. That sort of thing.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.837
People who join these
organizations, they, uh,

05:29.862 --> 05:32.029
tend to be lost souls.

05:32.064 --> 05:33.715
People who need a place to belong.

05:33.740 --> 05:35.172
So what are we looking for?

05:35.197 --> 05:36.996
Not what. Who.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.497
So everybody wants
to believe in an idea,

05:39.522 --> 05:42.357
but somebody's gotta
sell them the idea first.

05:42.382 --> 05:44.908
I think we need to go to Hope Valley,

05:44.944 --> 05:47.005
and find their salesman.

05:47.479 --> 05:50.113
Listen, we appreciate
you wanting to come,

05:50.149 --> 05:51.815
but after last time...

05:53.405 --> 05:55.587
maybe we've asked enough of you.

05:57.656 --> 06:00.090
Not a chance, sister.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.938
Here.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.866
Finally putting in that pool?

06:17.676 --> 06:19.509
Do we need this wall?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.378
It's load bearing, so yes.

06:21.413 --> 06:22.913
That's unfortunate.

06:24.116 --> 06:25.682
Make a hole.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.484
What the hell is this?

06:27.519 --> 06:31.521
- Project Charon...
- Need to know only, Dr. Adler.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.457
Project Charon. That sounds juicy.

06:33.492 --> 06:36.059
Charon, like, the ferryman
who carried the damned

06:36.095 --> 06:37.761
across the river Styx?

06:37.796 --> 06:39.063
That Charon?

06:39.088 --> 06:41.031
And here I thought
gym was the only class

06:41.066 --> 06:42.423
you paid attention to.

06:42.439 --> 06:44.532
Come on, Jonesy, give me a hint.

06:45.308 --> 06:48.148
Shh. Insurance.

06:50.727 --> 06:52.540
Insurance?

06:52.782 --> 06:54.695
Make a hole...

07:01.625 --> 07:04.125
Ahh! Oh! Shit! Sorry!

07:04.161 --> 07:05.839
Sorry, sorry. Okay.

07:10.626 --> 07:12.656
Oh, thank you, Lasky. You are my hero.

07:12.681 --> 07:14.681
Don't ask me to do that again.

07:14.716 --> 07:16.949
Did you get what you needed?
Your family heirlooms?

07:16.985 --> 07:18.818
Hm?

07:19.751 --> 07:22.021
Oh! Yeah.

07:22.057 --> 07:24.891
Uncle Cali's ashes.

07:24.926 --> 07:27.329
Always wanted to be on the mantle.

07:30.065 --> 07:31.964
It's okay.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.860
It's okay.

07:38.073 --> 07:40.073
Hey.

07:41.409 --> 07:42.975
Look, Terry. See?

07:43.011 --> 07:45.144
You grow up nice and big.

07:46.582 --> 07:48.088
That's old you.

07:48.113 --> 07:49.245
Look.

07:58.893 --> 08:01.648
Yeah, no. You can't get too
close, or you'll go boom.

08:02.030 --> 08:03.596
Don't be scared.

08:03.631 --> 08:06.099
You're home. See?

08:06.134 --> 08:08.101
There.

08:08.136 --> 08:09.635
Look.

08:09.671 --> 08:11.437
You know what I have?

08:11.473 --> 08:12.820
Snacks!

08:27.722 --> 08:29.555
Oh, God...

09:03.458 --> 09:05.425
Hey!

09:09.798 --> 09:12.062
I'm going to pay my respects
to the local sheriff.

09:12.087 --> 09:14.101
See if he's seen anything strange.

09:14.126 --> 09:17.027
- Anybody who doesn't belong.
- Like us?

09:17.052 --> 09:19.446
Oh, no, you're fine.
This is a mining town.

09:19.471 --> 09:22.438
Just need to tell people I
pulled you out of a dark hole.

09:22.463 --> 09:23.902
I'll be back.

09:25.682 --> 09:27.772
This doesn't feel shitty to you?

09:27.808 --> 09:30.942
Using Gale when we know
what happens to him in 1961.

09:30.978 --> 09:32.744
We can't change that.

09:32.779 --> 09:34.946
Right now, he's alive
and he can help us.

09:34.982 --> 09:38.149
Easy for you to say.
I'm the reason he dies.

09:38.185 --> 09:40.118
We could warn him. Tell him how he dies.

09:40.153 --> 09:42.610
- Give him a chance to...
- To what?

09:43.118 --> 09:45.156
Screw everything up?

09:45.192 --> 09:47.859
We don't know what would
happen if we told him the truth.

09:47.894 --> 09:51.196
Maybe we never stop the storms.
The Witness gets his red forest.

09:51.231 --> 09:53.999
You're the one who's afraid
we're stuck in a loop.

09:54.034 --> 09:57.366
So let's break out of it.
Let's change something.

09:57.391 --> 09:59.758
Let's save someone.

10:01.418 --> 10:03.251
We can't save him.

10:04.244 --> 10:06.211
I was talking about Gale.

10:06.246 --> 10:07.962
No, you weren't.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.009
Look, we've both seen
"The Word of the Witness."

10:12.470 --> 10:14.819
Maybe it's chaos, maybe it's crazy.

10:14.855 --> 10:18.024
It's also a plan. His plan.

10:18.478 --> 10:20.558
And everyone dies because of it.

10:20.594 --> 10:22.227
Everyone.

11:06.170 --> 11:07.539
Help them!

11:07.564 --> 11:09.207
Please! Please!

11:17.623 --> 11:19.217
Ash and blood...

11:37.776 --> 11:39.570
I see dead people.

11:39.595 --> 11:42.513
How many dead people? Anyone we know?

11:42.549 --> 11:45.015
And more to the point...

11:45.040 --> 11:46.950
any that look like me?

11:48.688 --> 11:50.521
That's the problem with being Primary.

11:50.557 --> 11:52.390
You're connected to time,

11:52.425 --> 11:54.717
but it won't let you
see the whole puzzle.

11:54.742 --> 11:57.395
It just keeps moving and changing.

11:57.430 --> 11:58.796
Loops looping.

11:58.832 --> 12:00.937
No... no straight lines.

12:00.962 --> 12:03.267
Seriously. How...

12:03.303 --> 12:04.535
What?

12:04.571 --> 12:06.601
...am I not on this?

12:07.123 --> 12:09.217
Everybody but me.

12:12.779 --> 12:15.279
Uh, what did your ghosty want?

12:15.315 --> 12:17.475
Told you. Not a ghost.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.242
Vision. Whatever.

12:19.267 --> 12:21.724
I don't know!

12:21.749 --> 12:24.835
She just keeps staring
at me and pointing!

12:24.860 --> 12:26.453
It's really got you rattled.

12:26.478 --> 12:28.703
'Cause this is how it starts!

12:29.055 --> 12:31.477
Visions. People, places, things.

12:31.502 --> 12:35.337
And it always ends in a
lock and a tiny, padded room.

12:35.372 --> 12:37.498
Hey. Look.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.408
No one...

12:39.443 --> 12:41.365
no one...

12:41.390 --> 12:43.806
is gonna lock you up.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.726
Okay?

12:46.164 --> 12:48.560
Your name is on there.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.710
Mine's not.

12:52.403 --> 12:54.995
You have a purpose.

12:55.020 --> 12:57.570
You are part of all of this.

12:57.595 --> 13:02.717
So, the next time you see
one of your free-floating,

13:02.742 --> 13:05.367
full torso, vaporous aberrations...

13:05.402 --> 13:07.169
talk to it.

13:12.007 --> 13:15.277
Local authorities confirm
it was a natural gas leak.

13:15.312 --> 13:17.446
This wasn't something
your 12 Monkeys did,

13:17.481 --> 13:20.824
but my bet is, they
knew it was gonna happen.

13:20.871 --> 13:22.379
The Witness?

13:22.404 --> 13:24.653
Whatever they're cooking up,
it's bigger than Hope Valley.

13:24.688 --> 13:27.189
Flood in St. Louis. 20 dead.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.741
Tornado in Abilene. 50 dead.

13:29.766 --> 13:32.227
Earthquake in Sacramento. 76 dead.

13:32.252 --> 13:34.563
And then the mining
disaster in Hope Valley.

13:34.598 --> 13:36.255
Now, the 12 Monkeys

13:36.280 --> 13:38.973
could've known about
each one of these events

13:38.998 --> 13:40.528
before they happened, right?

13:40.553 --> 13:42.606
How does that build them an army?

13:42.631 --> 13:44.607
I'm not sure,

13:44.632 --> 13:47.402
but I put in calls to
some of the local offices.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.711
They said there's a
spike in disappearances

13:49.747 --> 13:51.513
after each one of these events.

13:51.549 --> 13:53.382
Well, that's no surprise,
look at the death tolls.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.059
I'm not talking about the victims.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.752
He's talking about their families.

13:56.787 --> 13:58.453
They're not causing the tragedies,

13:58.489 --> 14:00.691
they're taking advantage of them.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.558
Preying on the ones left behind.

14:02.593 --> 14:04.680
That's how they're
finding their Faithful.

14:04.705 --> 14:06.161
Funerals.

14:06.197 --> 14:09.364
You want to find people at their
loneliest and most vulnerable?

14:09.400 --> 14:12.401
Problem is, we can't just
stake out every funeral in town.

14:12.436 --> 14:13.735
We still don't know who to look for.

14:13.771 --> 14:15.270
Wait a minute.

14:15.306 --> 14:17.073
Hang on.

14:17.098 --> 14:19.241
He was there on the
street after the explosion.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.604
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, positive.

14:21.629 --> 14:23.796
Texas. That's 1,600 miles away.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.655
And now he's here?
That's no coincidence.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.457
This could be him.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.659
Their recruiter. Their salesman.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.662
Okay, so we just need to
wait for the Grim Reaper,

14:33.698 --> 14:35.531
and follow him back to base camp.

14:35.566 --> 14:37.867
No, not good enough.

14:37.902 --> 14:41.070
To take them down from the inside,
we need to be on the inside.

14:41.105 --> 14:42.671
If we want to get into this

14:42.707 --> 14:45.374
"First Gathering of the Faithful,"

14:45.410 --> 14:47.043
we need to be recruited.

14:47.078 --> 14:49.045
Just like everyone else.

14:57.955 --> 15:00.142
Sister.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.292
You must really have taken
me for a dim-witted schmoe.

15:03.327 --> 15:04.994
Huh?

15:05.029 --> 15:06.996
Oh. Yeah.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.938
Had me fooled back in '44.

15:11.204 --> 15:13.602
Different this time, though.

15:13.638 --> 15:15.179
The way she looks at you.

15:15.204 --> 15:16.913
The way you look at her.

15:18.142 --> 15:19.909
That story she told about you having

15:19.944 --> 15:23.188
your giggle-stick shot off.
You copping to that, too?

15:23.798 --> 15:25.414
Trust me.

15:25.450 --> 15:27.016
If that had happened,

15:27.556 --> 15:29.685
we wouldn't be in this situation.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.528
Okay, I see him.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.210
He's coming.

15:41.235 --> 15:42.919
Finally.

15:45.171 --> 15:49.030
They tell us time heals all wounds.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.554
And I believe it creates them.

15:56.437 --> 15:57.867
Tell me.

15:58.616 --> 16:01.864
For whom do you grieve?

16:06.557 --> 16:08.691
My husband.

16:08.726 --> 16:11.360
He was killed inside the mine.

16:38.029 --> 16:40.449
We were married for 15 years.

16:41.692 --> 16:46.662
He slaved away in that
mine day in and day out.

16:46.697 --> 16:50.043
We didn't have much...

16:51.569 --> 16:53.318
but we had each other.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.654
A perfect life.

16:57.295 --> 16:59.675
Or as perfect as it could be.

17:03.714 --> 17:07.957
I've been to many services.

17:07.982 --> 17:11.356
Encountered grief in many forms.

17:12.021 --> 17:14.467
Tears. Laughter.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.271
And stony faces.

17:18.217 --> 17:19.920
But yours...

17:21.123 --> 17:22.965
confounds me.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.769
I don't understand.

17:26.804 --> 17:31.607
You wear the mask of loss,
but you do not feel it.

17:32.490 --> 17:35.778
At least not for your husband.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.481
I'm afraid what I have to offer...

17:40.262 --> 17:42.262
isn't for you.

17:43.702 --> 17:46.716
- We're gonna lose him.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:47.302 --> 17:48.691
You're right.

17:50.061 --> 17:51.727
I don't feel it.

17:53.364 --> 17:56.707
My husband died in the mine, but...

17:58.326 --> 18:00.841
I lost him long before.

18:01.451 --> 18:04.819
Time was our enemy.

18:06.859 --> 18:09.606
We spent so much of it apart...

18:13.382 --> 18:15.895
But there was a moment...

18:17.781 --> 18:20.201
when it was just the two of us...

18:21.523 --> 18:24.071
about to be the three of us...

18:26.140 --> 18:31.112
and it felt like we were exactly
where we were supposed to be.

18:33.718 --> 18:35.972
I've never been so happy.

18:42.887 --> 18:45.111
But it had to end.

18:48.364 --> 18:50.364
And we ended up apart.

18:52.146 --> 18:54.368
And we lost our child.

18:57.005 --> 19:00.718
I guess I thought we would find
our way back to each other...

19:05.248 --> 19:07.181
but I'm still stuck...

19:08.433 --> 19:10.399
in that moment.

19:12.415 --> 19:16.100
Every day, I wake up wondering...

19:17.919 --> 19:20.816
what our family would have been like...

19:20.841 --> 19:23.964
if we had the chance to actually be one.

19:40.851 --> 19:43.518
Join us at the Wake.

19:43.543 --> 19:46.012
We offer you a chance...

19:46.652 --> 19:50.391
to live in that perfect moment...

19:51.894 --> 19:53.894
forever.

19:58.915 --> 20:00.984
Looks like I'm joining
the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

20:02.290 --> 20:04.436
"Eternal. Forever."

20:05.266 --> 20:07.875
Every faith, religion,

20:07.900 --> 20:09.866
cult, the 12 Monkeys...

20:09.891 --> 20:12.444
they all promise the same thing.

20:12.469 --> 20:14.860
Something beyond this.

20:14.896 --> 20:18.831
Either an end to your
pain, or a reason for it.

20:18.866 --> 20:20.733
People just want to believe

20:20.768 --> 20:23.068
they have control over their own fate.

20:23.104 --> 20:25.237
Good luck with that.

20:27.275 --> 20:29.048
What do you think, Gale?

20:29.810 --> 20:31.110
About fate?

20:33.314 --> 20:35.981
In my experience, Cassie,

20:36.017 --> 20:37.983
you can bust down a
door on a routine raid,

20:38.019 --> 20:39.485
and before you know it,

20:39.510 --> 20:42.657
some numbskull with a $30
popgun from Sears Roebuck

20:42.690 --> 20:44.532
is either giving you a haircut,

20:44.557 --> 20:46.524
or putting your lights out.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.171
That's not fate. That's dumb luck.

20:49.196 --> 20:52.865
But either way, when
it's time for my dirt nap?

20:54.902 --> 20:58.348
Yeah, I'd hope I'd have
something to say about it all.

20:58.771 --> 21:00.737
Maybe you can.

21:02.486 --> 21:05.050
You trying to tell me something, Cassie?

21:08.616 --> 21:10.153
No.

21:25.933 --> 21:27.833
Well, this looks inviting.

21:35.578 --> 21:37.844
Good luck, Cassie. We'll be watching.

21:42.616 --> 21:44.412
- 1961.
- Cassie.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.270
That's when you die.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.140
You get shot in East Berlin
trying to cross the wall.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.684
I die?

21:55.173 --> 21:57.239
Am I allowed to ask how?

21:57.873 --> 21:59.784
- You die because of...
- Us.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.465
You help us.

22:03.874 --> 22:05.621
We escape.

22:06.863 --> 22:09.026
You get gunned down.

22:13.607 --> 22:15.499
You deserve to know.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.465
Does it make a difference?

22:18.538 --> 22:20.567
My dying, I mean.

22:21.074 --> 22:22.909
I don't know.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.387
You're not the first friend we've lost.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.447
Probably won't be the last.

22:55.584 --> 22:57.181
Ugh!

22:57.210 --> 22:58.537
What are you doing?

22:58.945 --> 23:01.412
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.114
Are you okay?

23:08.488 --> 23:11.350
- What the hell are you doing?
- Go with her.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.803
I'll stay here.

23:15.215 --> 23:17.182
Go home to your family.

23:17.693 --> 23:19.069
In fact, when I call you in 61',

23:19.094 --> 23:21.165
just call me a douchebag, and hang up.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.867
Well, I don't know what a douchebag is,

23:22.902 --> 23:24.869
but I'll definitely call you something.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.467
You're gonna help me anyway, aren't you?

23:29.492 --> 23:32.343
- Another goddamn loop.
- I don't know.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.812
We'll find out in '61.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.480
Good luck.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.883
Good luck.

24:06.638 --> 24:08.231
What are you doing here?

24:08.256 --> 24:09.980
What you said back there.

24:10.024 --> 24:13.025
- At the cemetery.
- I said what he needed to hear.

24:15.288 --> 24:18.455
The happiest moment of my life...

24:19.225 --> 24:22.282
is the day I found out
I was gonna be a father...

24:22.744 --> 24:25.486
being with you there, in that house.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.966
I still see it. The house.

24:28.991 --> 24:31.969
But not just memories of us.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.971
I see him there.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.973
Waiting for something.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.976
The Witness exists because
of a past that shouldn't...

24:39.011 --> 24:40.978
Athan.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.249
I wanted to name him Athan.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.994
You want to mourn him.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.689
That's fine.

24:49.564 --> 24:51.188
I can't.

24:51.213 --> 24:54.347
Because to you, he's just an idea.

24:54.394 --> 24:56.360
But I carried him.

24:56.396 --> 24:58.431
I saw him.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.165
For me, he's real.

25:02.935 --> 25:06.237
My wife and I wish to thank you all

25:06.272 --> 25:10.141
for accepting our invitation.

25:11.778 --> 25:15.179
I am merely the missionary.

25:17.679 --> 25:21.967
But I am the messenger.

25:29.462 --> 25:31.797
Okeydoke. Here goes nothing.

25:35.180 --> 25:37.147
Hey, old girl.

25:37.172 --> 25:38.839
So, uh...

25:40.642 --> 25:43.010
it's time I had a chat with Time.

25:43.045 --> 25:45.545
So could you put me through or whatever?

25:48.267 --> 25:49.700
Hi, Time.

25:49.725 --> 25:52.386
A long-time listener, first-time caller.

25:52.421 --> 25:54.755
I just wanted to let you know that...

25:55.304 --> 25:57.312
I'm ready...

25:58.027 --> 26:01.762
for whatever it is you want to show me.

26:04.433 --> 26:06.433
Ready, Freddie.

26:13.835 --> 26:15.327
Okay.

26:20.116 --> 26:21.804
Aw, shit.

26:31.329 --> 26:34.529
And cue dead lady.

26:39.601 --> 26:41.002
He's watching me.

26:48.254 --> 26:51.445
I would like to help you.

26:56.085 --> 26:58.051
You want me to go that way?

27:00.434 --> 27:02.276
The forest is red...

27:03.957 --> 27:06.143
You have a purpose,
Jennifer. You are Primary.

27:06.168 --> 27:08.424
I see everything. The forest is red.

27:16.314 --> 27:18.846
- You're Jennifer.
- I don't want her to see me.

27:20.371 --> 27:22.676
There something about its eyes.

27:45.677 --> 27:47.113
The forest is red.

27:54.443 --> 27:56.409
I am Time.

27:56.445 --> 27:58.612
The forest is red.

28:12.761 --> 28:13.887
You.

28:52.635 --> 28:56.665
Do you know why you're here?

28:57.281 --> 28:59.755
Because you exist in a place

28:59.780 --> 29:01.840
between the beginning...

29:01.865 --> 29:04.203
and the end.

29:04.238 --> 29:08.574
You've been taught that
time is a series of steps.

29:08.609 --> 29:10.076
Always forward.

29:10.111 --> 29:12.244
Greedy. Hungry.

29:12.280 --> 29:16.916
Devouring. An uncatchable thief.

29:16.951 --> 29:21.987
My friends, it is only
the passage of time

29:22.023 --> 29:26.619
that fools us into
believing we are not forever.

29:26.644 --> 29:28.861
There is a reason...

29:28.896 --> 29:32.231
clocks are round.

29:32.266 --> 29:35.428
Every measure visible at once...

29:35.461 --> 29:39.440
every moment... past,
present, and future...

29:39.465 --> 29:41.550
with you in the center.

29:41.575 --> 29:44.909
But what if you could ascend...

29:44.934 --> 29:47.027
from the center clock?

29:47.052 --> 29:49.181
Imagine...

29:49.206 --> 29:51.269
an eternity...

29:51.294 --> 29:53.596
where the ancient past,

29:53.621 --> 29:55.588
your present,

29:55.613 --> 29:57.292
and the distant future

29:57.317 --> 30:00.770
all exist at once.

30:02.637 --> 30:04.425
Infinite.

30:05.942 --> 30:07.183
Eternal.

30:07.208 --> 30:08.442
No death.

30:08.467 --> 30:09.932
No life.

30:11.038 --> 30:13.294
A forever.

30:13.319 --> 30:14.707
Now.

30:17.310 --> 30:19.255
This isn't a wake. It's a sermon.

30:19.290 --> 30:21.074
And it's working.

30:21.099 --> 30:23.766
There is a place.

30:23.791 --> 30:26.758
A place more beautiful...

30:28.941 --> 30:32.575
than any garden Adam
and Eve could offer.

30:34.185 --> 30:38.697
- In a forest.
- A red forest.

30:38.733 --> 30:41.848
We take out these two, the
whole thing dies right here.

30:41.873 --> 30:45.404
No Army of the 12 Monkeys. Ever.

30:47.441 --> 30:49.408
I'll take the reaper.

30:49.443 --> 30:52.111
What about the kid? We
know what he becomes.

30:52.146 --> 30:55.314
If we kill them, maybe he changes.

30:55.349 --> 30:58.017
Becomes something
else. Something better.

30:58.052 --> 30:59.952
We only got one shot at this.

30:59.987 --> 31:05.124
Tonight, one of you will be chosen.

31:05.159 --> 31:07.126
One of you...

31:08.683 --> 31:10.996
will see your loved ones again.

31:12.574 --> 31:13.999
What's happening?

31:20.982 --> 31:25.208
But this Wake is not for the departed.

31:25.646 --> 31:27.419
It is for you.

31:59.113 --> 32:01.614
Allow us to introduce you to...

32:03.150 --> 32:05.284
The Witness.

32:18.365 --> 32:20.802
Tonight, we offer you a way to mourn.

32:20.827 --> 32:22.894
A way to purge the grief of those...

32:22.920 --> 32:26.206
stolen from or poisoned by time.

32:28.242 --> 32:30.614
But only one of you here shall be chosen

32:30.639 --> 32:33.106
One innocent of those feelings of pain,

32:33.142 --> 32:34.808
of doubt.

32:34.844 --> 32:37.144
One chosen by our prophet.

32:37.179 --> 32:40.681
He who has known the very
length and breadth of time.

33:06.441 --> 33:07.845
Jennifer.

33:07.870 --> 33:09.332
Jennifer.

33:09.372 --> 33:10.955
Jennifer.

33:12.748 --> 33:14.986
607, 607, 607, 607.

33:15.011 --> 33:16.394
607.

33:16.980 --> 33:18.332
Return to Titan.

33:19.455 --> 33:20.659
Return to Titan.

33:20.684 --> 33:22.089
The serpent eats its tail.

33:22.124 --> 33:24.091
Serpent's eating its tail.

33:24.126 --> 33:25.183
Tail!

33:25.208 --> 33:26.448
- Break the cycle.
- Cycle.

33:26.473 --> 33:27.534
Break the cycle.

33:27.559 --> 33:29.293
Jennifer. Jennifer. Return to Titan.

33:29.454 --> 33:31.909
Climb the steps. Ring the bell.

33:39.370 --> 33:40.774
Cole.

33:41.810 --> 33:43.644
He's Primary.

33:45.848 --> 33:49.056
Which of these Faithful
shall be our 12th?

33:50.719 --> 33:53.923
Number 12, number 12...

33:56.301 --> 33:58.306
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

33:58.331 --> 33:59.826
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

33:59.862 --> 34:02.650
12 numbers 'round the clock.

34:02.675 --> 34:04.364
12 monkeys, 12 monkeys marching.

34:04.864 --> 34:06.253
12 monkeys marching.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.706
12 monkeys marching!

34:07.731 --> 34:09.995
Always marching around the clock.

34:10.020 --> 34:12.089
12 monkey marching...

34:12.114 --> 34:13.597
We have to do something.

34:13.621 --> 34:15.143
We can't.

34:15.534 --> 34:18.159
- If the guardians see us...
- We can't just leave him.

34:18.185 --> 34:19.964
Not with them. Not with her.

34:19.989 --> 34:22.275
If they undo this, we'll
never get a shot at this again.

34:22.301 --> 34:24.547
We won't get a chance to save him.

34:33.141 --> 34:34.815
Find her.

34:54.879 --> 34:56.844
She is meant for us.

34:59.195 --> 35:01.485
She is 12.

35:14.729 --> 35:16.162
Cry no more.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.698
You will find peace in the red forest.

35:26.207 --> 35:29.320
Almost all the species
that have ever existed

35:29.345 --> 35:31.281
are now extinct...

35:32.761 --> 35:34.714
because of time,

35:34.749 --> 35:36.382
everything dies.

35:40.892 --> 35:43.089
The Faithful have been chosen.

35:52.834 --> 35:55.134
Son of a bitch!

35:55.170 --> 35:57.136
Why can't I stay and watch?

35:57.172 --> 36:00.073
No, no, no, no. It's
not for your eyes, son.

36:00.557 --> 36:01.908
Not yet.

36:10.380 --> 36:11.981
Hold it.

36:12.856 --> 36:14.654
I remember you.

36:19.816 --> 36:21.315
This is for you.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.573
What is this?

36:22.598 --> 36:23.763
Fate.

36:23.798 --> 36:26.799
Thank you all for your sacrifice.

36:58.833 --> 37:01.134
Cole? Cole!

37:10.178 --> 37:12.145
- Cole?
- Cassie!

37:14.182 --> 37:16.015
Cassie!

37:21.222 --> 37:23.189
Cover your face! Get down low!

37:25.393 --> 37:27.293
We're trapped.

37:43.111 --> 37:44.449
Hang on!

38:23.620 --> 38:25.587
I see you took my advice.

38:27.191 --> 38:28.549
Ooh.

38:30.174 --> 38:31.826
Is that the same tortoise?

38:33.530 --> 38:35.196
Does Jones know that you brought back

38:35.232 --> 38:37.198
- a paradox in a half-shell?
- No.

38:45.153 --> 38:47.786
Got an ID on our mystery man yet?

38:47.811 --> 38:49.541
No.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.515
I think I'm supposed to save him.

38:53.550 --> 38:55.088
Uh-huh.

38:55.819 --> 38:57.785
What's that?

38:57.821 --> 39:00.001
Mausoleum.

39:06.163 --> 39:08.407
I see you got the whole family here.

39:09.948 --> 39:14.071
I see Cole, Railly, and Jones.

39:14.096 --> 39:15.573
Hannah.

39:15.598 --> 39:16.819
Don't see the Ramse.

39:16.844 --> 39:19.278
- Something's gonna happen.
- Uh-huh.

39:19.314 --> 39:21.188
- Something bad.
- Yeah.

39:21.213 --> 39:22.825
But I can't see it.

39:22.850 --> 39:25.418
It's pieces of a puzzle and
I don't know how they fit.

39:25.453 --> 39:27.286
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Deacon?

39:27.322 --> 39:29.288
Yeah. You're missing a piece.

39:39.834 --> 39:42.668
I got a look at your boss's memoir.

39:42.704 --> 39:44.937
And I couldn't help but
notice that I wasn't in it.

39:46.507 --> 39:48.341
How do I fit into all this?

39:50.100 --> 39:51.848
Maybe you don't.

39:52.547 --> 39:54.013
If it wasn't for me,

39:54.048 --> 39:56.716
your freaks in the
ropes and the face paint

39:56.751 --> 39:58.417
never would've gotten into this place

39:58.453 --> 40:00.419
and get to use Jones' machine, so...

40:00.455 --> 40:03.756
The Messengers' cycle
had many moving parts.

40:03.791 --> 40:05.758
Some were interchangeable.

40:08.164 --> 40:10.895
Perhaps you were the
path of least resistance.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.701
I am not a goddamn red shirt!

40:14.369 --> 40:16.303
I have a purpose!

40:17.038 --> 40:19.004
Are you certain?

40:20.775 --> 40:22.308
If there's one thing
I've learned to recognize,

40:22.333 --> 40:24.230
it's a fellow lost soul.

40:25.425 --> 40:26.946
Bullshit.

40:28.850 --> 40:31.970
There was a time when my
purpose was everything.

40:31.995 --> 40:33.819
Made me feel important

40:33.855 --> 40:36.401
even though I was being used.

40:37.392 --> 40:39.401
Well, you got played.

40:40.061 --> 40:42.003
That's not my DNA.

40:42.597 --> 40:44.530
Mine either.

40:44.565 --> 40:47.237
We are what we were made to be.

40:48.102 --> 40:50.815
You want to know your purpose?

40:51.472 --> 40:53.159
Ask yourself.

40:54.342 --> 40:56.308
What were you made to be?

41:04.908 --> 41:05.907
Where are we?

41:05.932 --> 41:07.553
When are we?

41:07.588 --> 41:09.065
The same night.

41:12.593 --> 41:14.894
He's right there.

41:14.929 --> 41:16.620
We got him.

41:16.645 --> 41:19.214
Right here. Right now.

41:19.239 --> 41:22.468
We finally know where
they're all gonna be.

41:24.672 --> 41:26.505
We're being pulled back.

41:26.541 --> 41:29.213
- We gotta go after them.
- We will.

41:29.704 --> 41:32.372
We'll come back to this moment.

41:32.397 --> 41:34.530
Armed and ready.

41:34.749 --> 41:36.715
Stop him once and for all.

41:43.925 --> 41:45.891
Mr. Cole, your temporal signatures

41:45.927 --> 41:48.060
jumped locations.

41:48.095 --> 41:50.501
What the hell happened back there?

41:50.886 --> 41:52.391
Merry Christmas.

42:07.595 --> 42:09.028
James.

42:10.344 --> 42:12.171
There's nothing to say.

42:13.013 --> 42:15.147
They made him.

42:15.182 --> 42:18.150
That's nurture, not nature.

42:20.187 --> 42:21.695
That's not what I saw.

42:22.199 --> 42:23.468
Neither did you.

42:34.201 --> 42:36.662
I know what we're supposed to do.

42:38.501 --> 42:40.467
But I can't.

42:45.315 --> 42:46.945
I can.
