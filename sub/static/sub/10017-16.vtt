00:46.430 --> 00:50.324
- What do they need us for?
- A lady's been trapped in a car for an hour.

00:50.526 --> 00:52.581
They can't move her until we intubate.

00:52.824 --> 00:54.811
- They always drive this fast?
- Yep.

00:55.021 --> 00:57.314
- They ever hit anybody?
- All the time.

00:57.519 --> 00:59.948
- How can you eat through this?
- Hungry.

01:01.881 --> 01:05.275
All right, we're here.
Grab the O-neg, stay close.

01:09.206 --> 01:11.998
Cherokee missed the runway,
slammed into a car.

01:12.203 --> 01:15.596
Guy in the plane's toast.
A lady's pinned in the back seat.

01:15.799 --> 01:18.921
Fire's been trying to get to her.
Plane's leaking fuel.

01:19.129 --> 01:20.457
They can't use the jaws.

01:20.660 --> 01:24.020
- I'm freezing. Anybody got a coat?
- Get the doctor a coat.

01:24.224 --> 01:26.187
We managed two large IVs.

01:26.654 --> 01:29.173
BP's 70 over 30.
Golden hour's almost over.

01:29.650 --> 01:31.046
Head trauma, ALOC.

01:31.249 --> 01:33.905
We've been bagging her
but she's been gagging.

01:34.113 --> 01:36.668
Husband and kids are
already at the hospital.

01:36.876 --> 01:38.340
Carter, follow me in.

01:39.007 --> 01:41.028
Get that O-neg going, all right?

01:41.238 --> 01:44.860
If we don't get her out in
a couple minutes, she won't make it.

01:45.067 --> 01:46.054
Start with Pavulon.

01:49.929 --> 01:52.256
Versed to sedate.

01:55.057 --> 01:56.714
Cricoid pressure.

01:58.287 --> 01:59.478
I got it.

02:00.517 --> 02:03.276
Finally, succinylcholine.

02:03.481 --> 02:05.139
What the hell is that?

02:05.711 --> 02:07.573
- It's aviation fuel.
- Laryngoscope.

02:07.776 --> 02:10.864
- I wouldn't smoke.
- Think gasoline comes out of camel hair?

02:11.373 --> 02:13.836
- Can we get in here?
- Two seconds.

02:15.501 --> 02:17.692
- New coat?
- Christmas.

02:17.899 --> 02:20.488
- Nice.
- It was.

02:21.262 --> 02:22.726
All right, let's go!

02:26.190 --> 02:29.414
Release pressure. All right, clear out.

02:29.653 --> 02:31.617
Slide out, Carter. Keep bagging.

02:31.817 --> 02:32.975
Start the chopper!

02:33.182 --> 02:36.475
Let's move it, let's move it!
They're coming out.

02:36.979 --> 02:38.806
Move her. Move her fast.

02:39.009 --> 02:40.201
Thank you.

02:41.207 --> 02:43.397
May I? Thanks.

02:45.636 --> 02:47.032
Watch out.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.220
So you decide on a specialty yet?

02:50.830 --> 02:54.724
- My folks are set on cardiology.
- Well, what are you thinking?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.684
- I'm thinking this is pretty exciting.
- It's not bad.

02:57.856 --> 03:00.944
Stress, late nights, hard work, no pay.

03:01.152 --> 03:03.241
- It's hard to beat.
- Watch her head!

03:03.450 --> 03:05.640
Let's go, guys. Move her, move her.

03:05.848 --> 03:07.278
Both femurs broken...

03:07.479 --> 03:10.908
...possible spinal cord injury,
pressure's 80.

03:11.109 --> 03:13.867
We're gonna notify the O.R.
Before we get there.

03:14.072 --> 03:15.059
You fly before?

03:15.270 --> 03:17.393
Oh, yeah, lots of times.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.691
- What's the M.A. R?
- County General.

03:22.962 --> 03:24.926
Faster!

03:25.127 --> 03:27.317
Make sure you get that fire out.

03:27.524 --> 03:30.180
- She gonna make it?
- She is now.

03:30.388 --> 03:31.716
Watch that tail rotor!

03:31.920 --> 03:34.610
We're gonna move her on three. Ready?

03:34.817 --> 03:36.576
One, two, three.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.267
No room!

03:39.079 --> 03:43.007
Can't go. Stay here. Grab our stuff
and ride back with the paramedics.

03:43.207 --> 03:45.762
She's free. Long backboard.

04:15.572 --> 04:17.196
Hell of a life, isn't it?

04:17.603 --> 04:20.089
- What?
- It's a hell of a life.

04:21.999 --> 04:24.689
I said, I wanna have sex
with your wife.

05:25.297 --> 05:27.624
Watch your back, please.
Coming through.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.586
- God, he's in a foul mood.
- Today's a good day.

05:30.792 --> 05:32.847
- You finish your presentation?
- Not yet.

05:33.056 --> 05:35.111
I was gonna grab a few minutes.
You?

05:35.320 --> 05:37.580
I am so far behind,
I may not even finish.

05:37.784 --> 05:40.441
- Benton's gonna kill me.
- Just do your best.

05:40.647 --> 05:43.838
How can we prepare when we
follow him on 36-hour shifts?

05:44.044 --> 05:48.631
Ms. Chen, if this surgical rotation is
too much, there's always dermatology.

05:50.604 --> 05:54.430
48-year-old MVA, fractured
right femur, pressure's 60 over 40.

05:54.632 --> 05:56.493
- Abdomen's rigid.
- All right.

05:56.697 --> 05:58.718
Let's get some O-neg going,
wide open.

05:58.928 --> 06:00.018
Already did it.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.383
- What's your name, sir?
- Bill McClintock.

06:04.622 --> 06:07.449
Mr. McClintock, is it tender here?

06:08.617 --> 06:10.911
- Were you wearing a seat belt?
- No.

06:11.081 --> 06:14.010
- You will next time, I bet.
- Peritoneal lavage?

06:14.212 --> 06:16.176
Carter, look at this abdomen.

06:16.376 --> 06:20.827
Either he's bleeding out and needs to go to
the O.R. Or he's giving birth to a basketball.

06:21.038 --> 06:23.762
- Haleh, call up to the O.R.
- I already called.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.760
- Dr. Benton, head trauma in 1.
- All right, I'll be right there.

06:27.963 --> 06:31.154
Ms. Chen, get a Foley catheter started.

06:33.324 --> 06:34.879
You ever do one before?

06:35.855 --> 06:37.046
In for a treat.

06:38.219 --> 06:41.545
Carter, since when does it take
two students to start a Foley?

06:45.112 --> 06:48.904
Clean it with Betadine,
put K-Y on the catheter...

06:49.107 --> 06:50.799
...and thread it in.

06:53.170 --> 06:56.360
- Give it to me.
- 42 years old, collapsed playing handball.

06:56.566 --> 06:59.461
40 palp, tachycardic 110, resps 30.

06:59.662 --> 07:03.250
Two liters NS in. 15 liters O-2.
Name's Jonathan Weiss.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.649
Am I having a heart attack?

07:06.388 --> 07:08.511
Am I having a heart attack?

07:08.720 --> 07:11.013
- Do you have a history of cardiac trouble?
- No.

07:11.217 --> 07:14.237
I'll get a CBC, Chem-7, enzymes,
coag panel and chest film.

07:14.447 --> 07:16.274
He's pale. He's not oxygenating.

07:16.745 --> 07:18.538
Pressure's still 40 palp.

07:18.743 --> 07:21.365
- What do we got, Susan?
- Possible MI.

07:21.573 --> 07:24.002
- I don't wanna die.
- We don't want you to die.

07:24.203 --> 07:26.497
So you do your part
and we'll do ours.

07:26.700 --> 07:30.026
His breathing's not improving.
Could be a pulmonary embolism.

07:30.230 --> 07:33.159
- What?
- A blood clot in your lungs, Mr. Weiss.

07:33.359 --> 07:35.448
Have you had any surgery recently?

07:35.924 --> 07:38.819
Been in any kind
of car accident, trauma?

07:39.088 --> 07:41.573
Spent a lot of time
traveling, sitting?

07:41.784 --> 07:43.271
EKG?

07:44.781 --> 07:48.073
- T wave inversions. I'm thinking heart.
- I'm not. VQ scan!

07:48.277 --> 07:50.207
He has no risk factors.

07:50.408 --> 07:51.633
I need that chest film.

07:51.907 --> 07:53.700
And I need an echo.

07:54.804 --> 07:56.960
Well, that can't hurt.
Let's do it.

08:00.065 --> 08:01.790
Mr. Conally?

08:03.261 --> 08:04.385
Where are you?

08:04.593 --> 08:07.022
Right here. Under the sheet.

08:07.223 --> 08:08.744
Why are you under the sheet?

08:08.955 --> 08:11.111
I've been dead for two days.

08:11.286 --> 08:12.443
Okay.

08:12.618 --> 08:15.342
But you are still suffering
from headaches?

08:15.548 --> 08:17.943
Oh, boy, am I ever.

08:18.145 --> 08:20.870
And what precipitates
these headaches?

08:21.075 --> 08:22.267
Death.

08:25.737 --> 08:26.724
What was that?

08:26.935 --> 08:29.592
Nervous tic. I've had it for years.

08:33.727 --> 08:35.692
Blood gases are back.
PO-2's low.

08:35.893 --> 08:37.913
- Where's the chest film?
- Right here.

08:38.124 --> 08:39.815
The pulse ox is down to 51.

08:40.022 --> 08:42.077
- Pulmonary artery's enlarged.
- He's crashing.

08:42.284 --> 08:44.181
- Perfusion scan?
- VQ mismatch.

08:45.182 --> 08:48.270
You were right.
1.5 million units streptokinase.

08:48.479 --> 08:51.442
Forget that. Get him to Trauma.
We need a fluoroscope.

08:51.643 --> 08:55.469
Somebody get Morgenstern.
Rolando, we got a Trauma room?

08:55.672 --> 08:57.260
Yeah. Two's open.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.331
- Gonna do an embolectomy?
- First time for everything.

09:00.532 --> 09:03.223
- What's going on?
- Saddle embolus, Mark's going in.

09:03.429 --> 09:05.484
He's doing an extraction in the ER?

09:06.127 --> 09:10.487
Mr. Smitrovich is in 4.
CBC, Chem-7, blood gases, IV started.

09:10.688 --> 09:13.947
Luchesse's in 6. Abdominal pain,
vomiting blood...

09:14.151 --> 09:15.978
...NPO, a nasogastric tube...

09:16.183 --> 09:17.841
- Dr. Benton?
- What is it?

09:18.047 --> 09:21.805
If Dr. Greene is doing an embolectomy,
we... I'd like to observe it.

09:23.175 --> 09:24.799
Who's stopping you? Go.

09:25.007 --> 09:27.129
You wanna go too?
Get out of here.

09:27.338 --> 09:29.460
- What's the matter with you?
- Luchesse?

09:29.668 --> 09:32.722
Vomiting blood, NPO,
nasogastric tube, gastric lavage.

09:32.931 --> 09:34.452
You ordered a gastric lavage?

09:34.663 --> 09:37.921
No, I wrote it down.
You still have to sign it.

09:38.125 --> 09:40.520
- I write my own orders.
- Nurse?

09:40.723 --> 09:43.845
If you're having a problem today,
don't take it out on me.

09:44.053 --> 09:48.038
I write the orders,
you carry them out, understood?

09:49.680 --> 09:51.735
- Nurse!
- What?

09:52.144 --> 09:53.904
Isoproterenol's going.

09:54.108 --> 09:56.765
Ease the catheter in slowly...

09:58.138 --> 10:00.499
...and thread it up to
the pulmonary artery.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.728
Be careful not to puncture
the vena cava.

10:05.763 --> 10:09.714
- How's Mr. Weiss doing?
- Resps are up to 45.

10:09.925 --> 10:11.549
Pulse ox down to 63.

10:11.757 --> 10:14.549
Hang in there, you'll be feeling better
before you know it.

10:14.753 --> 10:18.147
Carter, Chen, why don't you
get over here so you can see.

10:21.146 --> 10:22.168
See that?

10:23.278 --> 10:25.174
I'm in the right ventricle.

10:27.007 --> 10:28.698
Is that cool, or what?

10:29.638 --> 10:32.260
- Carter, you see the embolus?
- Yeah, it's huge.

10:32.468 --> 10:35.363
Position the cup against the clot.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.085
Good. Start your syringe suction...

10:42.091 --> 10:44.610
...and aspirate the embolus
into the cup.

10:49.415 --> 10:50.573
Got it.

10:50.781 --> 10:52.268
Now work back down.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.234
Just like snaking a drain.

11:01.337 --> 11:03.766
Well, folks, I got a date
with a bile duct.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.761
Carry on, one and all.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.554
- Pulse ox up to 85.
- Resps are coming down.

11:08.761 --> 11:10.487
How you feeling, Mr. Weiss?

11:12.791 --> 11:14.415
I can breathe.

11:14.988 --> 11:16.748
I can breathe.

11:19.117 --> 11:21.603
Okay, Harold. So something bit you?

11:21.814 --> 11:24.777
- Pet snake.
- Oh, yeah? I used to keep frogs.

11:24.978 --> 11:27.373
Frogs are amphibians.
My snake eats frogs.

11:27.575 --> 11:30.300
- What kind of snake?
- Yellow eyelash pit viper.

11:32.170 --> 11:35.065
- You have a pet pit viper? Is it poisonous?
- Very.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.159
I'll call poison control.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.724
Are you feeling weak, Harold,
nauseous, any chills?

11:40.928 --> 11:44.288
No. Can you tell if
it's poisonous just by looking?

11:44.490 --> 11:46.114
I don't think so.

11:46.321 --> 11:48.581
Because I got him
right here in the bag.

11:49.618 --> 11:51.638
We're gonna keep him
in the bag, okay?

11:51.849 --> 11:55.039
No. He's cold-blooded
and I had him on the El all day.

11:55.245 --> 11:56.709
He'll sleep.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.636
He was here a minute ago.

12:04.835 --> 12:06.696
Don't contradict me
in front of nurses.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.885
I wasn't contradicting you,
we disagreed on a diagnosis.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.559
I'd appreciate your showing
more restraint.

12:12.759 --> 12:13.883
The man was dying.

12:14.092 --> 12:17.213
- I'm asking you for respect.
- I wasn't being disrespectful...

12:17.422 --> 12:18.512
Yes or no?

12:18.720 --> 12:20.479
I respect you, Susan.

12:20.684 --> 12:23.442
Thank you. Now, try to show it
once in a while.

12:23.648 --> 12:27.905
- I'll get animal control in here.
- What's going on? Doug, what's going on?

12:28.110 --> 12:31.039
This is Dr. Ross in ER.
Pit viper got loose.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.534
- A snake?
- A big snake.

12:32.738 --> 12:36.393
Dr. Greene? 36-year-old woman
with breast cancer...

12:36.601 --> 12:38.293
...brought in from Dignity House.

12:38.499 --> 12:41.757
Two modified radical mastectomies,
spread to her lymph nodes.

12:41.962 --> 12:45.413
- Who are you?
- Anita Risberg, a nurse at the hospice.

12:45.624 --> 12:48.781
- Mark Greene. She have chemo?
- Tamoxifen.

12:48.987 --> 12:50.383
But it's metastasized.

12:50.586 --> 12:53.481
- Pelvis. Spine.
- You got her on morphine?

12:53.683 --> 12:57.610
120 mg just to sleep, but the last
few days, it's just not enough.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.500
I got worried if I up the dose,
it'd cause further respiratory depression.

13:01.707 --> 13:03.398
You're right. What's her name?

13:03.605 --> 13:06.329
Grace. Grace Holsten.

13:06.669 --> 13:09.098
Hi, Grace. I'm Mark Greene.

13:09.299 --> 13:10.923
We'll make you more comfortable.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.117
Doctor, please...

13:13.328 --> 13:14.883
...let me die.

13:15.293 --> 13:16.621
Please...

13:16.890 --> 13:18.514
...let me die.

13:28.411 --> 13:30.807
Animal control guy believes
it's a tree snake.

13:31.009 --> 13:34.063
He thinks it'll crawl up
high where it's warm.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.092
Sorry, doc.

13:36.470 --> 13:39.456
I'll spend the rest of the day
on my hands and knees.

13:39.666 --> 13:41.187
Lydia, Doug. Come over here.

13:42.396 --> 13:46.915
It took 6 months and a couple thousand
requisition forms, but I finally did it.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.816
Guess what's under the sheet?

13:52.186 --> 13:54.207
- Come on, guess.
- We don't wanna guess.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.381
Oh, come on, please?

13:56.914 --> 13:59.174
- New day bed for the lounge?
- Nope.

14:01.044 --> 14:03.200
- New vending machines?
- Nope.

14:04.673 --> 14:06.069
New crash carts.

14:06.271 --> 14:07.667
- That's great.
- Wow!

14:07.870 --> 14:09.493
Where'd you get those?

14:09.701 --> 14:12.323
Cardiology wanted them,
but I was relentless.

14:12.531 --> 14:15.392
An abdominal pain in 3
and a gunshot victim coming in.

14:15.595 --> 14:17.854
Now, no raiding off
the new crash carts.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.283
Everything on these carts
stays on the carts.

14:21.488 --> 14:22.850
Thank you.

14:28.247 --> 14:32.266
Dr. Benton, about this afternoon's
trauma presentation.

14:32.477 --> 14:35.167
- I'm not fully prepared.
- You've known for weeks.

14:35.373 --> 14:38.598
- Yes, sir, I know that...
- Don't call me sir, Ms. Chen.

14:38.802 --> 14:40.959
Yes, sir. I mean, doctor.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.687
I'm sorry.

14:43.098 --> 14:45.653
I only need a half-hour or so.

14:46.861 --> 14:49.756
What about you, Mr. Carter?
Do you also need more time?

14:50.024 --> 14:51.716
No. I'm all set.

14:52.488 --> 14:56.473
Well, when you find you have
the time to rejoin us, please do so.

14:59.747 --> 15:02.676
84-year-old man,
complaining of abdominal pain.

15:02.876 --> 15:04.897
- Where's his chart?
- In the rack.

15:05.608 --> 15:07.333
At the desk.

15:10.003 --> 15:12.557
Carter, go get his chart.

15:13.832 --> 15:16.885
I'll need a CBC, Chem-7,
coag panel and drop...

15:17.095 --> 15:20.149
...a nasogastric tube.
You gonna write this down?

15:20.625 --> 15:23.144
I'm not comfortable taking
verbal orders.

15:23.821 --> 15:26.376
I think you better write
everything down for us.

15:28.116 --> 15:30.545
- Us?
- The nurses.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.535
Here's his chart.

15:35.275 --> 15:37.398
Start writing.

15:46.097 --> 15:47.356
Grace...

15:47.596 --> 15:51.819
...we've added fentanyl to the morphine.
See if that helps.

15:52.324 --> 15:54.685
If it doesn't work,
we have three choices.

15:54.887 --> 15:59.372
We can insert a catheter into your
spinal cord to deliver the morphine.

16:00.082 --> 16:02.511
Or we can surgically cut
the spinal tracts...

16:02.712 --> 16:05.732
...that carry the pain
from your legs and back.

16:06.342 --> 16:08.771
Or we can increase your morphine...

16:08.972 --> 16:12.163
...but your dosage is so high
it might depress your breathing.

16:12.369 --> 16:14.390
Can you stop this pain?

16:15.466 --> 16:17.487
I'm not sure. We're trying.

16:17.696 --> 16:19.058
Try harder.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.480
- Resps?
- Fourteen.

16:29.783 --> 16:32.507
Let me know if her breathing
gets any worse.

16:38.508 --> 16:39.904
Don't even ask.

16:40.106 --> 16:41.729
Mark, keep me company.

16:41.937 --> 16:44.059
- Good call on that pulmonary embolism.
- Thanks.

16:44.268 --> 16:47.889
Oncology found a small polyp.
If he hadn't tossed a clot...

16:48.097 --> 16:51.889
...who knows how far that would've gone
before rearing its ugly head.

16:52.093 --> 16:55.146
- What's all this?
- Some kind of tree snake got loose.

16:55.356 --> 16:56.547
Really?

16:56.888 --> 16:59.749
I was impressed about
your concern for the students.

16:59.951 --> 17:02.211
Making sure they were
involved and learning.

17:02.415 --> 17:06.037
You're a fine teacher. Given any thought
as to what you'll do next year?

17:06.243 --> 17:08.105
Start repaying med school loans.

17:08.309 --> 17:10.738
Sent a few letters
but I haven't started.

17:10.940 --> 17:13.767
Why don't you think about
joining the staff here?

17:14.669 --> 17:15.656
As an attending?

17:15.867 --> 17:19.261
You won't make as much money
as the cowboys at private hospitals...

17:19.464 --> 17:22.325
...but there are other rewards,
ephemeral as they may be.

17:24.092 --> 17:27.486
- Well, think about it anyway.
- No, I'd be honored. Really.

17:28.154 --> 17:29.584
Here's my bus.

17:32.249 --> 17:35.212
- Thank you.
- Thank you. You earned it.

17:37.378 --> 17:39.864
12-year-old male, multiple gunshots
to the leg and abdomen.

17:40.075 --> 17:44.094
We scooped and ran. IV's wide open,
had two liters, no palpable pressure.

17:44.303 --> 17:46.994
All right, let's look alive.
Let's wheel him in.

17:48.865 --> 17:50.692
- O-neg. Let's move.
- Grab me that dynamap.

17:50.863 --> 17:53.950
- That IV infiltrated?
- Hang the blood Y-tubing.

17:54.126 --> 17:55.113
Ready, lift.

17:55.558 --> 17:57.545
- Get an H and H.
- I don't get a pulse.

17:57.755 --> 17:58.777
He's still breathing.

17:58.988 --> 18:02.746
Tried to apply pressure but
he was a sieve. Name's Yummy Jackson.

18:02.950 --> 18:05.572
- Drive-by?
- Drug deal gone bad. Gang thing.

18:05.781 --> 18:06.837
At 12 years old?

18:07.046 --> 18:09.838
Kid had a Tech-9 and a Ruger on him
when we found him.

18:10.043 --> 18:14.266
- Trauma 1, get in here now!
- Watch that line.

18:16.369 --> 18:18.798
- She's still in a lot of pain.
- Okay.

18:21.031 --> 18:23.257
I'm sorry the fentanyl
isn't helping much.

18:23.461 --> 18:24.948
It's helping a little.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.918
Can we do anything
to make you more comfortable?

18:28.123 --> 18:30.144
You can shoot me.

18:31.619 --> 18:34.344
I'm sorry, I didn't bring my gun
to work today.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.707
I don't think it's safe to
up the morphine any higher.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.340
Afraid it'll kill me?

18:42.574 --> 18:43.561
It might.

18:48.002 --> 18:51.328
There's not a lot more
that the ER can do to help you.

18:51.665 --> 18:54.094
Do you want me to admit you
to the hospital?

18:56.159 --> 18:57.817
Can I go back to the hospice?

18:58.024 --> 19:02.509
Yes, but they're gonna need to
bring you back here for a higher dosage.

19:03.318 --> 19:05.804
Can I take a little while to decide?

19:08.280 --> 19:09.404
Sure.

19:28.391 --> 19:30.049
Can I help you?

19:31.288 --> 19:33.683
Excuse me, can I help you?

19:34.584 --> 19:36.775
You can't be back here.

19:38.281 --> 19:40.177
You must go now.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.026
Oh, my God.

20:08.781 --> 20:11.370
- Son of a bitch!
- Get out the way.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.494
You're too late.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.429
He's already dead.

21:08.617 --> 21:10.172
It's madness.

21:12.580 --> 21:15.770
You can clearly see the posterior
dislocation of the knee...

21:15.976 --> 21:18.405
...consistent with
this sledding injury...

21:18.607 --> 21:21.069
...which occurred when
the impact applied...

21:21.270 --> 21:23.325
...direct force to
the anterior tibia...

21:23.534 --> 21:26.293
...while the knee was flexed.
Injury to the...

21:26.498 --> 21:29.552
- I'm really nervous.
- Don't worry about it.

21:29.761 --> 21:31.748
I picked too easy a topic.

21:31.959 --> 21:35.978
Relax. Dr. Benton doesn't expect
that much. It's your first rotation.

21:38.085 --> 21:42.445
- With horizontal traction
and realignment of the joint.

21:42.648 --> 21:45.667
Angiography should be considered...

21:45.877 --> 21:48.170
...with attention paid to the five P's:

21:49.706 --> 21:52.998
Pain, pallor, paresthesias...

21:53.203 --> 21:56.495
...pulselessness and paralysis.

21:57.898 --> 21:59.828
All right. Who's next? Carter.

22:12.516 --> 22:15.070
While attempting
a Rollerblading maneuver...

22:15.279 --> 22:18.265
...this 12-year-old male...

22:18.475 --> 22:21.666
...fell on his outstretched
right hand...

22:21.872 --> 22:26.799
...resulting in a Salter-Harris type II
epiphyseal fracture...

22:27.000 --> 22:28.930
...of the proximal humerus.

22:29.431 --> 22:34.289
To avoid damage to the growth plate,
the humeral head, in angulation...

22:34.492 --> 22:37.614
...and external rotation,
must be reduced...

22:37.821 --> 22:40.841
...by abducting and externally
rotating the arm...

22:41.051 --> 22:43.277
...and then slowly bringing...

22:43.482 --> 22:44.777
...the arm down.

22:46.545 --> 22:49.974
If the reduction is not accomplished,
the arm must be maintained...

22:50.175 --> 22:53.796
...in a cast in
the Statue of Liberty position.

22:55.736 --> 22:57.495
Is that it?

22:59.964 --> 23:01.326
Any questions?

23:01.529 --> 23:03.084
Ms. Chen.

23:12.784 --> 23:14.146
You'll do great.

23:14.348 --> 23:15.472
Here.

23:17.412 --> 23:19.569
Facial fractures.

23:20.476 --> 23:22.030
You'll find an outline...

23:22.240 --> 23:26.191
...and recent research articles.

23:26.703 --> 23:28.291
Would you pass it down?

23:32.329 --> 23:34.156
Here we see examples...

23:34.361 --> 23:39.015
...of a depressed fracture
of the left frontal bone...

23:39.222 --> 23:42.185
...with disruption to the orbital rim.

23:42.851 --> 23:46.143
Both the result
of blunt-force trauma...

23:46.348 --> 23:49.606
...when the patient's face
intercepted a tire iron.

23:49.977 --> 23:52.940
John, if you would, please?
The projector.

23:58.535 --> 23:59.999
Thank you.

24:08.025 --> 24:10.988
Orbital rim and
frontal sinus fractures...

24:11.187 --> 24:13.912
...along with other fractures
to these facial bones...

24:14.218 --> 24:17.976
...often result in
concomitant CNS injury.

24:18.180 --> 24:21.143
Diagnosis is established
with radiographic studies...

24:21.343 --> 24:24.397
...and computerized tomography,
preferably using...

24:24.607 --> 24:28.000
...a three-dimensional image
of the patient's skull.

24:30.067 --> 24:32.825
As you can see, the frontal sinus...

24:33.031 --> 24:37.651
...and orbital rim fractures here
are easily appreciated...

24:40.789 --> 24:41.947
How's her breathing?

24:42.154 --> 24:44.583
Depressed but okay.
She's finally out.

24:44.785 --> 24:48.269
Maybe we got the balance right,
and she can get some sleep.

24:51.744 --> 24:53.299
Kathy.

24:54.574 --> 24:57.197
- Who's Kathy?
- Her little girl.

24:58.737 --> 25:00.031
Does she know she's here?

25:00.235 --> 25:03.254
She lives out West somewhere
with Grace's ex-husband.

25:03.465 --> 25:04.452
Seattle, I think.

25:05.563 --> 25:08.151
Grace gave up custody
when she entered the hospice.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.449
She lost her child?

25:10.325 --> 25:12.084
She entered the hospice to die.

25:12.821 --> 25:14.342
Life goes on.

25:14.752 --> 25:17.012
Then again, sometimes it doesn't.

25:18.915 --> 25:21.401
- Old hospice joke.
- Oh, God!

25:21.579 --> 25:22.737
Oh, God!

25:22.911 --> 25:25.306
- God, it hurts.
- The fentanyl's wearing off.

25:25.508 --> 25:27.994
- Lie down. Lie down.
- It hurts.

25:28.205 --> 25:31.326
Her resps are too low,
I can't give her any more morphine.

25:31.502 --> 25:34.896
- I can't stand it. I can't stand it.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

25:35.664 --> 25:39.853
- It hurts so much, doctor.
- There's nothing else I can do.

25:40.059 --> 25:43.488
Please kill me. Please.
Please. Please!

25:43.655 --> 25:45.517
- Relax. Just relax.
- Please kill me.

25:45.719 --> 25:47.240
Please, please!

25:51.879 --> 25:52.901
Susan!

25:53.877 --> 25:56.204
- What have we got?
- A 52-year-old male collapsed.

25:56.408 --> 25:58.565
Hypotensive, 80 over 60,
tachycardic at 120.

25:58.772 --> 26:01.133
Hypertension treated
with Altace and Tenormin.

26:01.336 --> 26:04.662
- Are those skates?
- He's a hockey ref, collapsed during a game.

26:04.865 --> 26:06.329
Some of the kids followed us.

26:06.531 --> 26:09.392
15 liters of O-2 and
he's had 8 migs morphine.

26:09.594 --> 26:13.715
He's diaphoretic. Call Cardiology.
I need an EKG and enzymes.

26:13.923 --> 26:16.113
You gotta wait in the waiting room.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.613
- Will he be okay?
- We don't know yet. Malik!

26:19.050 --> 26:21.071
- Can you take them to Waiting?
- In a minute.

26:21.281 --> 26:23.642
We're gonna do
everything we can, okay?

26:25.277 --> 26:27.002
Okay, get the ambu-bag.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.495
- Lost his pulse.
- He's in fib. Crash cart.

26:33.301 --> 26:35.027
Turn off the O-2.

26:35.699 --> 26:36.686
- Where's the cart?
- Here.

26:36.898 --> 26:38.192
No. Where's the new cart?

26:39.229 --> 26:40.455
Watch that line.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.784
Paddles!

26:41.992 --> 26:45.080
- I put one in here an hour ago.
- Carol, 200.

26:45.289 --> 26:48.184
- Somebody already stole my new cart!
- Clear!

26:55.845 --> 26:57.241
Is Jake around?

26:58.209 --> 26:59.934
He went to get a soda.

27:00.738 --> 27:03.100
Nice digs. This is how
the other half lives?

27:03.269 --> 27:05.755
I could do with a little
less glass, actually.

27:05.967 --> 27:08.952
There's no blood on the carpet,
so it's a step up from the ER.

27:09.163 --> 27:11.490
Mind if I sit? I've had my shots.

27:12.293 --> 27:14.621
Cindy was right.
You are kind of charming.

27:15.989 --> 27:17.612
Is that bad?

27:17.887 --> 27:19.351
Depends.

27:20.285 --> 27:22.646
- Jake's a great kid.
- He is a great kid.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.368
I hope you don't mind
if we shoot hoops now and then.

27:25.579 --> 27:28.700
I won't pass along any misogyny
with the basketball tips.

27:28.909 --> 27:32.360
If misogyny's genetic, he's
inherited plenty from his father.

27:33.804 --> 27:36.699
- Does he see his dad much?
- They communicate by check...

27:36.866 --> 27:38.728
...when it comes.

27:40.996 --> 27:43.152
If you don't like me,
you don't have to hide it.

27:43.326 --> 27:47.311
- You can just come out and show it.
- I didn't know I was being subtle.

27:48.221 --> 27:49.845
Hey, yourself!

27:50.086 --> 27:52.345
Dr. Ross came to see
if you wanna play basketball.

27:53.116 --> 27:55.046
We'll be about a half an hour.

27:55.247 --> 27:57.836
- And put the jacket on.
- I'll make sure he wears it.

28:05.802 --> 28:07.925
D5 NS...

28:08.766 --> 28:11.060
...100cc's per hour.

28:11.530 --> 28:15.821
NG tube, gastric lavage...

28:16.125 --> 28:19.179
...CBC, Chem-7, amylase.

28:20.487 --> 28:22.383
Call the O.R., book a room.

28:23.317 --> 28:24.543
Dr. Benton.

28:25.482 --> 28:27.309
What does this say?

28:28.145 --> 28:32.596
- NG tube.
- By that you mean a nasogastric tube?

28:32.773 --> 28:35.328
- Yes.
- And this?

28:36.370 --> 28:38.527
- Dextrose 5, normal saline.
- An IV?

28:38.734 --> 28:39.824
Yes, an IV.

28:40.399 --> 28:42.692
Well, I've examined the patient.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.983
And I believe she needs
a fine, surgical hand like yours...

28:46.193 --> 28:48.281
...to get an IV going properly.

28:49.222 --> 28:50.652
I'll have Carter do it.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.215
And the nasogastric tube?

28:53.784 --> 28:56.406
You'll notice
she has a deviated septum...

28:56.614 --> 28:59.543
...and I don't feel comfortable
putting one in.

29:03.474 --> 29:05.301
I'll do it myself.

29:05.505 --> 29:08.558
Tell the lab his coag panel's cooking.
Here are his chest films.

29:08.768 --> 29:13.025
If you can find those hockey kids,
tell them he's gonna be okay.

29:13.496 --> 29:15.517
Susan? Susan.

29:16.061 --> 29:17.820
Susan, come on.

29:18.557 --> 29:22.077
- I'm busy, Mark.
- I need to talk to you about a patient.

29:22.886 --> 29:26.213
End-stage breast cancer,
bone-Mets to her back and legs.

29:26.416 --> 29:29.845
Morphine's not working.
Neither's the fentanyl.

29:31.444 --> 29:34.997
She's in agony. There's nothing
I can do to help her.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.295
Spinal morphine therapy, cordotomy?

29:37.504 --> 29:40.024
She refused both of them.
She just wants to die.

29:40.234 --> 29:42.697
Well, it sounds like
she's going to, soon.

29:42.965 --> 29:44.952
She wants me to help her.

29:45.795 --> 29:47.520
Her resps are down to 12.

29:47.726 --> 29:51.347
If I give her a little more morphine,
her breathing will stop.

29:52.554 --> 29:54.143
What would you do?

29:55.351 --> 29:57.009
I don't know. I gotta go.

29:57.216 --> 29:59.475
How long are you gonna keep this up?

29:59.680 --> 30:02.870
- You weren't there for me.
- It was professional, not personal.

30:03.143 --> 30:07.071
We're not married, we work together.
Professional is personal.

30:07.272 --> 30:08.827
I miss you.

30:12.666 --> 30:16.060
You could have told me
you were doing facial fractures.

30:16.263 --> 30:18.317
And that computer thing.
I looked stupid.

30:18.526 --> 30:20.490
No, no. Keep irrigating that.

30:20.824 --> 30:23.616
I can give you the graphics program.
It's easy to use.

30:23.821 --> 30:24.911
That's not the point.

30:25.119 --> 30:28.344
I need a good recommendation
from Benton if I'm gonna get...

30:28.549 --> 30:29.911
...a surgical residency.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.370
- Vertical mattress, 4-0 nylon.
- You're going into surgery?

30:33.743 --> 30:35.230
Yeah. Why do you say it like that?

30:35.941 --> 30:38.370
No. I mean, I think you'd be great.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.229
No, you don't.
You sounded surprised.

30:40.436 --> 30:44.387
I do know surprised when I hear it.
You just sounded surprised.

30:44.599 --> 30:46.824
You really wanna go into surgery?

30:47.262 --> 30:48.817
I don't know. I might.

30:50.125 --> 30:53.815
Well, look, John, I've seen
my mother's surgical residents...

30:54.021 --> 30:57.212
...and the ones around here,
and it just doesn't seem like you.

30:57.418 --> 30:59.644
What do you mean,
your mother's residents?

30:59.848 --> 31:02.005
Your mother's a surgical attending?

31:03.744 --> 31:07.229
She's chief of surgery.
Could I get more four by four's?

31:07.407 --> 31:10.132
Chief of surgery?
Where? What hospital?

31:10.604 --> 31:11.795
St. Bart's.

31:12.002 --> 31:13.466
Why even come to school?

31:13.668 --> 31:15.427
You won't have trouble
getting a residency.

31:15.631 --> 31:18.117
It's not like that.
She won't help me at all.

31:18.329 --> 31:20.792
She didn't even want me
to go into medicine.

31:20.992 --> 31:22.786
Just don't say anything to anyone.

31:23.456 --> 31:24.784
They jump to conclusions...

31:24.988 --> 31:29.813
...and I end up having to prove myself
all over again. Okay? Please?

31:33.280 --> 31:34.971
I found the snake.

31:41.538 --> 31:42.763
Billy.

31:44.434 --> 31:45.523
Billy...

31:47.031 --> 31:48.121
...don't...

31:49.695 --> 31:50.886
...please.

31:55.389 --> 31:58.477
Mark, I need you in 2. Rule out MI.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.237
Don't.

32:05.911 --> 32:07.307
Billy.

32:07.543 --> 32:08.905
Please.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.299
Mark?

32:21.461 --> 32:23.322
I love you.

32:41.706 --> 32:44.964
- Cardiology would steal our crash carts?
- They steal everything.

32:45.169 --> 32:48.222
- Are you sure they're up here?
- They were two hours ago.

32:51.829 --> 32:54.950
Connie and Bob, stay with the carts.
You guys come with me.

33:23.195 --> 33:25.091
I think we're in the ladies' room.

34:22.964 --> 34:25.188
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

34:40.312 --> 34:41.831
- Dunphy's there!
- What do we do?

34:42.043 --> 34:43.598
Sheri Dunphy?

34:45.340 --> 34:46.827
Not a problem.

34:59.458 --> 35:00.582
Sheri?

35:01.389 --> 35:03.148
Doug, hi. How've you been?

35:03.354 --> 35:05.579
Good. You look great.
You lost some weight.

35:05.785 --> 35:08.804
- I got married last year, remember?
- I'm still in mourning.

35:09.846 --> 35:13.172
- Why are you up here?
- Is the Cath lab still up here somewhere?

35:13.376 --> 35:16.770
- It's where it's always been.
- Can you give me a hand?

35:16.973 --> 35:19.595
- Nope, I can't. I'm out of here.
- I got a patient.

35:19.803 --> 35:23.526
A 6-year-old, tetrology of fallot.

35:25.829 --> 35:28.292
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

35:32.789 --> 35:34.014
He's unbelievable.

35:34.221 --> 35:36.616
That's why I slept
with him on the first date.

35:36.817 --> 35:39.043
First date? No kidding.

35:40.314 --> 35:42.709
He rang the doorbell
and we were on the kitchen floor.

35:42.912 --> 35:44.466
Kitchen floor?

35:44.676 --> 35:47.571
Jeez, I gotta start dating again.

36:06.619 --> 36:08.447
Kids are having fun.

36:09.582 --> 36:12.636
Yeah. They're the hockey
players from my MI.

36:12.846 --> 36:14.605
Haven't been picked up yet.

36:14.810 --> 36:16.274
How'd he do?

36:17.374 --> 36:19.497
He's not dead,
if that's what you mean.

36:23.734 --> 36:24.756
No...

36:25.233 --> 36:26.561
...that's not what I meant.

36:29.695 --> 36:31.386
He's gonna be fine.

36:32.225 --> 36:33.951
How is she?

36:34.856 --> 36:37.046
She died a couple minutes ago.

36:40.217 --> 36:42.147
Respiratory failure?

36:46.410 --> 36:49.430
I was listening
to those kids playing...

36:50.005 --> 36:52.491
...and watching the snow fall.

36:55.466 --> 36:58.452
You know, if you stand right here...
Right over here...

36:58.663 --> 37:00.923
...you can see the El from here.

37:01.760 --> 37:05.654
Faces looking out the windows
into the darkness.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.512
Life goes on, Mark.

37:15.112 --> 37:17.269
Do you wanna get something to eat?

37:20.140 --> 37:23.194
I can't. Jennifer
and Rachel are in town.

37:24.435 --> 37:27.727
- Another time, maybe.
- Susan.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.084
Thanks.

37:34.591 --> 37:36.021
See you tomorrow.

37:55.602 --> 37:57.759
Stop now. Stop!

37:58.333 --> 38:00.229
Where are their parents?

38:05.558 --> 38:08.282
- I'm having problems with Haleh.
- So I heard.

38:08.588 --> 38:11.279
Reschedule her so we don't
have to work together.

38:11.485 --> 38:13.971
You're the one who
needs to be rescheduled.

38:14.182 --> 38:15.271
You won't do it?

38:15.481 --> 38:17.468
No. The nursing schedule
is my prerogative.

38:17.678 --> 38:20.164
Even if that situation
endangers patient care?

38:20.375 --> 38:22.066
You work every day
and every third night.

38:22.273 --> 38:24.362
She's got four kids.
When is she supposed to work?

38:24.571 --> 38:27.160
- She refuses to follow my instructions.
- Why should she?

38:27.367 --> 38:29.025
You're in training.
She graduated.

38:29.232 --> 38:31.389
Don't give me that.
We are not equals.

38:31.597 --> 38:33.787
She may not know how
to cross-clamp an aorta...

38:33.994 --> 38:36.219
...but she's worked in
emergency for 20 years.

38:36.425 --> 38:38.944
If you'd ever hop off
that pedestal you're on...

38:39.155 --> 38:42.141
...you might see that the nurses
make this place work, not you.

38:51.742 --> 38:53.729
I smell food.

38:54.073 --> 38:58.467
- I'm actually cooking.
- Like, from scratch and everything?

39:00.433 --> 39:03.396
Yeah, who knows? It might
become an annual tradition.

39:04.661 --> 39:08.146
I don't know. I remember
you cooking something last summer.

39:08.357 --> 39:10.912
I think it was meatloaf, maybe.

39:11.121 --> 39:12.880
It was definitely brown.

39:13.085 --> 39:14.913
Semiannual, then.

39:15.116 --> 39:18.772
- When did you get home?
- Seven or so. The traffic was awful.

39:18.979 --> 39:20.375
Where's Rach?

39:20.943 --> 39:22.804
She's in the bathtub.

39:25.205 --> 39:27.794
God, what a week!
I'm exhausted.

39:28.469 --> 39:31.330
- How was your day?
- Great and awful.

39:31.532 --> 39:34.756
Tell me great.
I'm too tired for awful.

39:35.961 --> 39:38.924
Morgenstern offered me a job...

39:39.124 --> 39:41.917
...as attending physician next year.

39:45.084 --> 39:47.547
- What'd you say?
- I said yes.

39:48.247 --> 39:50.507
Without discussing it with me first?

39:51.544 --> 39:52.735
An attending.

39:53.642 --> 39:55.902
I figured I'd be spending
nights and weekends...

39:56.106 --> 39:58.569
...at some community hospital
in Winnetka.

40:02.499 --> 40:03.827
Is this a problem?

40:05.296 --> 40:07.725
Can you tell him you need time
to think about it?

40:07.927 --> 40:11.979
I don't need to think about it.
This is a great opportunity!

40:14.020 --> 40:18.471
I won't know until March if Judge
Franklin needs me to clerk next year.

40:21.212 --> 40:24.175
You're considering spending
another year in Milwaukee?

40:24.375 --> 40:25.704
If he wants me to, yes.

40:25.907 --> 40:27.394
- But I assumed...
- Exactly!

40:27.606 --> 40:29.796
You assume things would
be the way you want.

40:30.070 --> 40:34.464
The last six months haven't exactly
been the way I want them...

40:37.394 --> 40:40.551
I've been living by myself,
without my wife, without my daughter.

40:40.757 --> 40:42.812
"My wife, my daughter"!

40:43.022 --> 40:46.916
It's only been six months.
What about the last six years?

40:47.117 --> 40:49.774
What about medical school,
rotations and residency?

40:50.048 --> 40:51.978
Who was a paralegal
so we had food?

40:52.179 --> 40:54.438
Who was in night school
for years, finishing college?

40:54.643 --> 40:55.937
Was that you?

40:56.807 --> 40:58.465
No, that was me.

40:59.737 --> 41:03.529
So now I want it to be
about me for a change, not you.

41:21.314 --> 41:23.175
How are you doing, Mr. Conally?

41:23.379 --> 41:24.571
You still dead?

41:24.777 --> 41:26.741
Oh, yeah, very.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.803
- My head feels better, though.
- Well, that's good.

41:30.171 --> 41:33.395
You just let us know if we can
get you anything else, okay?

41:36.565 --> 41:37.654
Night.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.858
Good night.

42:02.703 --> 42:04.929
- You're late. It's almost 10:00.
- Yeah.

42:05.100 --> 42:08.859
I got held up at the hospital.
Where's Walt and my sister?

42:09.330 --> 42:11.418
Something at your niece's school.

42:11.627 --> 42:14.817
If you say you'll be here at 8,
I need you to be here at 8.

42:15.023 --> 42:16.612
I've got an early shift tomorrow.

42:18.054 --> 42:19.348
Okay.

42:20.351 --> 42:21.679
How was your first day?

42:22.582 --> 42:25.102
- How long ago was your mom's stroke?
- 8 months.

42:25.312 --> 42:27.572
And it was a right parietal CVA?

42:29.374 --> 42:31.929
She's still suffering
from left hemiparesis.

42:32.138 --> 42:36.328
- Has she had any physical therapy at all?
- Of course she has. In the beginning.

42:37.133 --> 42:39.562
My mother doesn't have
problems getting around.

42:39.763 --> 42:42.817
That's the problem.
She's always wandering off.

42:43.027 --> 42:47.045
She's masking well, but she has
limited use of her left arm and leg.

42:47.255 --> 42:51.580
And she's got bruises all over her
left side from running into things.

42:52.349 --> 42:56.039
And you should have warned me
about the incontinence.

42:57.311 --> 43:01.103
Yeah, well, that's
just a sometime thing.

43:01.873 --> 43:03.837
Not tonight, it wasn't.

43:10.431 --> 43:11.690
Can you help my mother?

43:12.661 --> 43:16.884
I can't make her any younger, but
I can probably improve her mobility.

43:17.623 --> 43:19.280
She's a great lady.

43:19.687 --> 43:22.275
I wish I'd known her
before the stroke.

43:22.917 --> 43:26.868
I heard a lot about you. She wouldn't
stop talking about her Petey.

43:27.079 --> 43:28.339
I'm sorry about that.

43:28.544 --> 43:31.201
You're the baby in the family, right?

43:33.539 --> 43:36.400
I'm the youngest in the family, yeah.

43:37.834 --> 43:41.626
My baby sister too.
My mom just loves her to death.

43:41.830 --> 43:43.794
It still pisses me off.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.854
Good night.
