Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:03.588 --> 00:04.855
<i>We have been looking for you</i>

00:04.889 --> 00:06.156
<i>and your friends.</i>

00:09.360 --> 00:10.827
Who's the little girl?

00:10.862 --> 00:12.578
Who's the little
blonde girl?

00:12.613 --> 00:13.847
If you are watching this,

00:13.882 --> 00:14.929
then you know
that the Observers

00:14.963 --> 00:16.397
have invaded.

00:16.431 --> 00:17.929
I must have ambered it.

00:17.963 --> 00:19.195
I need a proper laser.

00:19.229 --> 00:20.261
Could you make one?

00:20.295 --> 00:21.826
Don't you wear a necklace?

00:21.861 --> 00:23.669
We just need the silver
for solder.

00:23.704 --> 00:25.269
Thank you.

00:25.303 --> 00:26.602
If you've found this tape,

00:26.636 --> 00:28.337
you've retrieved it
from amber.

00:28.370 --> 00:29.801
Got it.

00:29.835 --> 00:31.102
You must recover each tape
to retrieve

00:31.136 --> 00:32.603
all the parts of the plan.

00:32.637 --> 00:35.644
This plan can rid the world
of the Observers.

00:35.678 --> 00:39.481
You are humanity's
only hope!

00:44.922 --> 00:48.126
<i>Nah, he don't think</i>
<i>nothing about it.</i>

00:52.499 --> 00:54.695
It should only probably
take a few hours.

00:54.729 --> 00:56.720
He don't give me the money,
he's gonna know about it.

00:56.755 --> 00:59.024
I'll tell you that.

00:59.058 --> 01:00.625
Appreciate the help.

01:00.659 --> 01:03.627

Looking to barter?

01:37.662 --> 01:41.832
No.
Not tonight.

<i>"If you want to make God laugh,</i>

01:46.204 --> 01:48.373
<i>It's been there</i>

01:48.407 --> 01:50.541
Guess it hits
a little close to home.

01:50.575 --> 01:54.077
Yeah.

01:54.112 --> 01:57.213
Man...

01:57.248 --> 01:58.914
I had one of these
when I was a kid.

02:00.683 --> 02:02.117
I'll give you
a good deal, man.

02:02.151 --> 02:06.021
Actually, what I'm
looking for is a--

02:06.055 --> 02:09.789
This is what
you are looking for.

02:15.662 --> 02:16.863
Yup.
That's it.

02:16.897 --> 02:19.299
It will look good
on her,

02:19.333 --> 02:22.635
the young, blonde woman.

02:25.106 --> 02:26.406
What is baseball?

02:26.440 --> 02:27.940
Excuse me?

02:27.975 --> 02:30.375
<i>You were thinking</i>
<i>of the Red Sox.</i>

02:30.410 --> 02:33.145
What is baseball?

02:33.179 --> 02:35.980
It's a sport--
or was anyway.

02:36.015 --> 02:37.215
How much?

02:37.249 --> 02:38.316
What do you want to give I
for that?

02:38.350 --> 02:41.553
I am upsetting you.

02:41.587 --> 02:44.723
You do not like
to be read.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.392
Who's upset?

02:48.995 --> 02:50.229
I got nothing to hide.

02:50.263 --> 02:51.230
What's to be upset about?

02:51.264 --> 02:52.599
That take care of it?

02:52.633 --> 02:54.300
Blood clot, man.

02:54.335 --> 02:56.069
I haven't seen one
of these in years.

02:56.103 --> 02:57.671
You're trying to confuse me.

02:57.705 --> 02:59.473
I don't know what
you're talking about, pal.

02:59.507 --> 03:01.074
Who is the young, blonde woman?
You are protecting her.

03:01.109 --> 03:02.543
Are you sure?
Do you know what this is worth?

03:02.577 --> 03:04.245
Yeah.
Keep the change.

03:06.915 --> 03:08.716
<i>My papers.</i>

03:08.750 --> 03:10.084
<i>What are you doing out so late?</i>

<i>Is this the only paperwork</i>

03:13.255 --> 03:16.425
There is something wrong.
Detain him.

03:16.459 --> 03:20.196
<i>Freeze!</i>
<i>Stop right there!</i>

03:20.230 --> 03:22.365
Now!

03:31.608 --> 03:35.044
He's down there.

03:35.079 --> 03:36.746

<i>It's just superficial.</i>

05:55.816 --> 05:57.383
<i>I was trying</i>

05:57.418 --> 05:58.818
I got read
by an Observer.

05:58.853 --> 06:00.920
He pulled thoughts
out of my head

06:00.955 --> 06:02.722
like cards out of a deck.
What did he get from you?

06:02.757 --> 06:06.960
He did get
an image of you.

06:09.297 --> 06:12.566
But at this point you're as much
a fugitive as the rest of us,

06:12.600 --> 06:14.868
so, unless you can think of a
reason why that would hurt us--

06:14.902 --> 06:16.737
Did he give any indication
that he pulled anything else?

06:16.771 --> 06:18.205
No.

06:18.239 --> 06:19.573
<i>I did what I'm supposed</i>
<i>to do, keep</i>

06:19.607 --> 06:20.908
<i>a bunch of random thoughts</i>
<i>in my head,</i>

06:20.942 --> 06:22.142
but then he knew
I was doing that too,

06:22.177 --> 06:23.911
so I just got out of there.

06:23.945 --> 06:27.447
These guys,

06:27.482 --> 06:28.782
they out-move us,
they out-think us.

06:28.816 --> 06:30.718
They're always
two steps ahead.

06:30.752 --> 06:35.088
More, if they focus.

06:35.123 --> 06:39.326
I don't know
how we're gonna beat 'em.

06:41.930 --> 06:44.331
We beat them
one by one.

06:44.365 --> 06:47.468
Instinctively,
you did the right thing.

06:47.502 --> 06:50.204
You just have to create
a labyrinth of planned thoughts,

06:50.239 --> 06:51.239
keep them preoccupied.

06:51.273 --> 06:53.008
Yeah.

06:53.042 --> 06:55.344
Trying to block
that reading was exhausting.

06:55.378 --> 06:57.846
I couldn't do it.
It's impossible.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.715
It's not impossible.
I've taught others.

06:59.749 --> 07:02.484
It just takes
a really long time.

07:04.553 --> 07:06.888
Well, teach me.

07:06.923 --> 07:08.957
I plan on it.

07:08.991 --> 07:11.593
I'm teaching you all.

07:11.627 --> 07:13.995
In the meantime,

07:14.029 --> 07:18.132
I want you to consider this
a down payment

07:18.167 --> 07:20.935
on my first lesson.

07:20.970 --> 07:22.036
You had to give up
your necklace

07:22.071 --> 07:23.171
so we could work
on the laser.

07:23.205 --> 07:24.171
I wanted to make sure

07:24.206 --> 07:27.875
you got a new one.

07:27.909 --> 07:29.343
Thank you.

07:32.714 --> 07:34.381
Worth every bump
and bruise, kiddo.

07:34.415 --> 07:36.583
Well, you know
the expression.

07:36.617 --> 07:38.718
No good deed
goes unpunished.

07:38.752 --> 07:40.353
Living proof.

08:14.656 --> 08:18.659
You wanted to see me?

08:18.694 --> 08:20.561
You do not like
to be read.

08:20.596 --> 08:22.764
Who's upset?

08:22.798 --> 08:24.533
What's there
to be upset about?

08:24.567 --> 08:27.269
I got nothing to hide.

08:27.303 --> 08:29.672
This is what he purchased--

08:29.706 --> 08:31.608
an alloy of gold
and other metals,

08:31.642 --> 08:34.244
minerals, argentite,
and chlorargyrite.

08:34.278 --> 08:37.614
What is its purpose?

08:37.649 --> 08:39.683
Its purpose?

08:39.717 --> 08:41.150
You wear it.

08:41.184 --> 08:44.654
You put it
around your neck.

08:44.688 --> 08:47.124
He is a fugitive.

08:47.158 --> 08:49.426
Why put oneself at risk
in this quadrant

08:49.460 --> 08:52.229
for something
so unexceptional?

08:52.263 --> 08:57.034
These fugitives are confident
enough to walk freely.

08:57.068 --> 09:01.672
I think they receive
information.

09:01.706 --> 09:04.608
The resistance
is protecting them.

09:04.643 --> 09:06.644
You mean
they're being tipped off?

09:06.678 --> 09:08.612
To our movements,
yes.

09:08.647 --> 09:11.716
Two days ago, one of the men
in your division

09:11.750 --> 09:13.684
failed a security test.

09:13.719 --> 09:17.922
I believe he
is with the resistance.

09:17.956 --> 09:19.924
I think you will be able
to get information

09:19.959 --> 09:22.627
about the fugitives
through him.

09:22.661 --> 09:26.464
Why didn't you tell me
about the security fail?

09:26.499 --> 09:28.967
I could ask you
the same question.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.836
I didn't know
about it.

09:31.871 --> 09:35.807
That is my point.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.880
I'll look into it.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.301
Welcome to tape two

10:02.336 --> 10:04.670
<i>of my plan</i>
<i>to defeat the Observers.</i>

10:04.704 --> 10:06.005
<i>Before we begin,</i>

10:06.039 --> 10:07.539
<i>first and foremost,</i>

10:07.574 --> 10:11.376
<i>you must accept</i>
<i>the reversibility</i>

10:11.411 --> 10:12.678
of all phenomena...

10:12.712 --> 10:15.614
Particles have their speeds
reversed,

10:15.649 --> 10:19.218
<i>then the changes--</i>
<i>found a measurable effect.</i>

10:19.252 --> 10:21.020
Let me be crystal clear--

10:21.054 --> 10:23.322
understanding
of these scientific concepts,

10:23.357 --> 10:26.592
<i>we will not be fighting</i>
<i>in the same field.</i>

10:29.396 --> 10:33.366
These are the plans that we
must follow to the letter--

10:33.400 --> 10:36.169
imperative
that these plans be retrieved.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.471
<i>Astrid, it's impossible to tell</i>
<i>what he's talking about.</i>

10:38.506 --> 10:40.707
This is as clear
as I can get it.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.311
I have hidden them as I would
my most prized possession.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.549
Funny story actually.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.517
When I was a boy,

10:51.552 --> 10:54.254
<i>my mother would take me</i>
<i>on what she called</i>

10:54.288 --> 10:57.291
<i>Manhattan mystery tours.</i>

10:57.325 --> 10:59.860
<i>We would catch the first train</i>
<i>that came to the station,</i>

10:59.894 --> 11:01.495
and then we would venture
into the city...

11:01.529 --> 11:03.564
And get off at the first--

11:03.598 --> 11:04.999
I'll never forget--
inspirational.

11:11.574 --> 11:13.608
<i>The tape is ripped.</i>

11:13.642 --> 11:15.110
It got caught
on a fleck of amber.

11:15.144 --> 11:17.212
I've heard enough.
I know where the tube is.

11:17.246 --> 11:18.546
- You do?
- <i>Mm.</i>

11:18.581 --> 11:19.814
The subway platform

11:19.849 --> 11:22.951
beneath Newark Penn Station
in the wall.

11:22.985 --> 11:24.720
<i>How do you know that?</i>

11:24.754 --> 11:26.322
<i>Because, as a boy,</i>
<i>my most prized possession</i>

11:26.356 --> 11:29.959
was my collection
of detective comics.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.694
And, like everyone,
I was terrified

11:31.729 --> 11:33.664
that the pinkos
would attack.

11:33.698 --> 11:36.500
So I thought
that a subway platform

11:36.534 --> 11:38.669
would be the safest place
to hide them.

11:38.704 --> 11:42.073
Because it was underground.

11:42.107 --> 11:43.307
I was ten.

11:43.342 --> 11:44.542
And that's where you hid
the plans?

11:44.576 --> 11:45.610
Yes.

11:45.644 --> 11:46.677
Under Newark Penn Station?

11:46.712 --> 11:48.045
I am sure of it.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.847
Every major access point
to Manhattan

11:49.882 --> 11:51.816
has an Observer checkpoint.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.684
<i>That includes train stations.</i>

11:56.655 --> 11:58.756
<i>Okay, we have</i>
<i>to take out the guards.</i>

11:58.790 --> 12:00.157
Are they Observers
or Loyalists?

12:00.191 --> 12:02.526
Both.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.328
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>if we can get close enough</i>

12:04.362 --> 12:06.563
<i>to effectively take them out</i>
<i>without being detected.</i>

12:06.598 --> 12:08.365
Well, we need
to create a diversion.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.035
I think we're gonna need
a lot more than a diversion.

12:11.069 --> 12:12.203
Peter.

12:12.237 --> 12:14.071
I'm going to want

12:14.105 --> 12:15.906
to get to
that rolling cabinet

12:15.941 --> 12:17.041
<i>in the amber.</i>

12:17.075 --> 12:18.075
Walter, there's nothing
in there

12:18.110 --> 12:19.210
except lab equipment

12:19.244 --> 12:20.678
and your Easy-Bake oven.

12:20.712 --> 12:22.946
I'm not
after what's in it.

12:22.981 --> 12:24.681
It's what's under it.

12:24.716 --> 12:27.051
<i>Astrif...</i>

12:27.085 --> 12:29.186
prepare the laser.

12:41.833 --> 12:45.035
Walter, why won't you tell us
what's down there?

12:45.070 --> 12:48.605
Because I'm not sure
that what's down there

12:48.639 --> 12:50.340
is worth talking about.

12:50.375 --> 12:53.877
I'm not sure what's left.

12:53.911 --> 12:55.745
Here.
Use some of this.

12:55.780 --> 12:57.347
All of you.

12:57.381 --> 12:59.515
It's mentholatum.

13:09.593 --> 13:11.294
Not as bad
as I thought.

13:19.871 --> 13:22.373
Walter, is this
what I think this is?

13:22.408 --> 13:24.909
My cold storage
of all the Fringe events

13:24.944 --> 13:26.377
we ever encountered,

13:26.411 --> 13:28.179
dormant for 21 years.

13:28.213 --> 13:29.780
If we're going
to find a diversion

13:29.815 --> 13:30.982
to get
into the railway station,

13:31.016 --> 13:32.149
we'll find it here.

13:32.184 --> 13:35.753
What do you suggest,
Walter?

13:35.787 --> 13:38.989
There was a time
when we solved Fringe cases.

13:39.024 --> 13:44.228
Now I think it's time
we created a few of our own.

13:53.723 --> 13:56.058
So this is every Fringe event?

13:56.092 --> 13:58.460
<i>Documented and preserved</i>

13:58.495 --> 14:00.529
<i>to the best of my ability.</i>

14:00.563 --> 14:03.999
Oh, look, Olivia,
my porcupine man.

14:04.033 --> 14:06.334
You really had no idea
that he was doing any of this?

14:06.368 --> 14:08.269
I wouldn't have slept at night
if I did.

14:08.303 --> 14:10.404
<i>Some secrets are meant</i>
<i>to be kept.</i>

14:10.438 --> 14:11.772
<i>For two reasons--</i>

14:11.807 --> 14:13.674
number one:
Because they're mine.

14:13.709 --> 14:17.112
And number two:
I have a healthy distrust

14:17.146 --> 14:18.313
of the government.

14:18.347 --> 14:21.949
These items
were safer with me.

14:21.984 --> 14:23.818
Oh!
Put that down.

14:23.852 --> 14:25.453
You'll Amber us.
It's an ambering device.

14:25.487 --> 14:28.556
Put it down gently.
Hair trigger,

14:28.590 --> 14:32.860
if I recall correctly.

14:37.133 --> 14:40.669
<i>There has got</i>
<i>to be a better option</i>

14:40.703 --> 14:42.471
for getting us
into that train station

14:42.505 --> 14:44.473
than a portal that takes us
to another universe.

14:47.710 --> 14:49.477
I suppose
you're right.

14:49.512 --> 14:51.146
We'll have
to go through all this

14:51.180 --> 14:52.581
to see what's still viable.

14:52.615 --> 14:55.983
The answer is here somewhere.

14:56.018 --> 15:00.020
Oh, my goodness.

15:00.054 --> 15:01.688
<i>What is it?</i>

15:01.723 --> 15:04.024
It's my old doughnut hole.

15:07.895 --> 15:09.496
Jelly.

15:09.530 --> 15:12.365
<i>It's still spongy.</i>

15:15.737 --> 15:17.370
It's still good.

15:25.912 --> 15:29.114
<i>Why am I still here?</i>

15:30.316 --> 15:33.018
Two days ago,
you failed a security test.

15:37.223 --> 15:39.858
<i>That's why you're nervous.</i>

15:43.496 --> 15:46.698
So you are a recent graduate
of the Academy?

15:46.732 --> 15:47.799
Yes.

15:47.834 --> 15:48.934
And your date of induction?

15:48.968 --> 15:51.870
April 25, 2033.

15:51.904 --> 15:53.772
<i>Were your parents</i>
<i>proud to see you in uniform</i>

15:53.806 --> 15:55.707
<i>for the first time?</i>

15:56.345 --> 15:59.313
My parents
are deceased.

15:59.748 --> 16:03.550
Did you think of them
during the ceremony?

16:03.584 --> 16:07.053
I missed them being there
if that's what you mean, yes.

16:08.658 --> 16:12.628
What was the weather like?

16:13.743 --> 16:15.944
What?

16:20.092 --> 16:23.094
That important day,
what's the weather?

16:25.097 --> 16:26.831
It was sunny.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.837
<i>On April 25, 2033</i>
<i>in Boston,</i>

16:32.872 --> 16:36.475
rainfall began
approximately at 10:20 a.m.

16:36.509 --> 16:42.114
<i>And continued steadily</i>
<i>well into the evening.</i>

16:48.589 --> 16:50.290
You were never
at the Academy.

16:50.324 --> 16:51.891
No, you're mistaken.

16:51.926 --> 16:55.262
I was class 58693-A.

16:58.933 --> 17:02.303
You are a member
of the resistance.

17:04.105 --> 17:05.573
Someone forged
your paperwork

17:05.607 --> 17:08.541
<i>to be installed</i>
<i>in your position.</i>

17:08.577 --> 17:12.079
You cannot conceal it.

17:14.549 --> 17:17.117
I can see it.

17:17.152 --> 17:19.486
Right there.

17:22.390 --> 17:27.194
What do you know
about the fugitives?

17:27.229 --> 17:29.597
Where is Peter Bishop?

17:29.632 --> 17:33.936
<i>Where did he go?</i>

17:33.970 --> 17:35.537
Where are the fugitives
hiding?

17:44.281 --> 17:47.650
You overheard Anil
say something?

17:47.684 --> 17:52.788
What did you hear Anil say?

17:52.823 --> 17:57.559
Forget about him
for a second.

17:57.593 --> 18:01.230
I saw something else...

18:01.264 --> 18:04.400
that interests me.

18:08.172 --> 18:09.673
The Dove.

18:14.512 --> 18:16.380
<i>Who is the Dove?</i>

18:16.414 --> 18:19.784
Hmm?

18:19.818 --> 18:21.685
What is his real name?

18:24.690 --> 18:26.758
I don't know!

18:26.792 --> 18:30.761
Nobody does.

18:57.405 --> 18:59.043
What did you discover?

18:59.044 --> 19:03.848
He is a low-level operative.
His information is limited.

19:03.882 --> 19:05.983
I found bits and pieces,

19:06.017 --> 19:09.687
but not everything.

19:12.057 --> 19:16.293
We've heard the name "the Dove"
three times now.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.783
What else?

19:25.293 --> 19:28.261
When I said
the name "Peter Bishop,"

19:28.296 --> 19:30.097
he recalled a moment
when he overheard Anil

19:30.131 --> 19:32.366
mention a lab
in sector B.

19:37.839 --> 19:40.941
I think
you know this

19:40.976 --> 19:44.811
as the old Harvard University.

19:50.117 --> 19:52.719
I thought
you would recognize it.

19:52.753 --> 19:55.754
You had a relationship
with these fugitives

19:55.789 --> 19:57.956
that I thought
we would call upon.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.528
Now how did you know that?

20:02.562 --> 20:05.164
That I had a relationship
with them?

20:05.199 --> 20:07.166
Captain Windmark
told me.

20:07.201 --> 20:10.603
He said he was going
to ask you about it.

20:10.637 --> 20:12.972
He did not?

20:20.738 --> 20:22.973
I knew them,

20:23.007 --> 20:25.976
but that was
a long time ago.

20:30.948 --> 20:33.350
<i>According</i>
<i>to this man's knowledge,</i>

20:33.384 --> 20:35.018
<i>they are in the lab.</i>

20:42.460 --> 20:44.394
I will make my report.

21:18.062 --> 21:20.697
Pull.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.635
Walter.

21:25.669 --> 21:28.637
Technically this is a weapon
of mass destruction.

21:28.671 --> 21:31.273
So is the mosquito
that carries the West Nile.

21:31.307 --> 21:32.741
This will do beautifully.

21:32.775 --> 21:34.776
<i>A perfect delivery system.</i>

21:38.413 --> 21:40.614
Looks like there are
more Loyalists.

21:40.649 --> 21:44.185
<i>What was the count before?</i>

21:44.219 --> 21:48.289
Three, four.
Now it's seven.

21:48.323 --> 21:49.557
It's not going to be easy

21:49.591 --> 21:52.594
getting
into this subway station.

21:58.101 --> 22:00.068
Where'd you get that?

22:00.103 --> 22:03.238
I found it

22:03.272 --> 22:08.310
at our old house
on Quincy Street.

22:11.447 --> 22:13.915
I wanted
to remember things.

22:13.949 --> 22:17.652
I don't know.
I just wanted to be there.

22:17.686 --> 22:21.789
It made me feel closer
to you.

22:21.823 --> 22:25.993
It was looted.
The entire block was.

22:26.027 --> 22:30.497
Upstairs in your bedroom,
what used to be your bedroom,

22:30.532 --> 22:32.433
I found what was left
of your old jewelry box.

22:32.467 --> 22:34.469
And there was
this matchbox inside.

22:34.503 --> 22:36.537
I shook it
and found this.

22:44.179 --> 22:46.381
I figured
it had to be important

22:46.415 --> 22:49.384
or you wouldn't have kept it.

22:49.418 --> 22:54.089
How long
have you been wearing it?

22:54.123 --> 22:57.525
Since I was 13.

23:06.869 --> 23:08.536
You want it back?

23:08.571 --> 23:11.340
No. No.

23:11.374 --> 23:14.076
No, I want you
to keep it.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.080
Let me see it.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.661
You know your father used
to call this

23:31.696 --> 23:34.998
"The bullet
that saved the world."

23:40.805 --> 23:42.472
The lab's been compromised.

24:08.835 --> 24:09.902
<i>Peter.</i>

24:09.936 --> 24:11.303
What's wrong?

24:11.337 --> 24:12.805
We need to go now.
Well, we're ready.

24:12.839 --> 24:13.939
No, the Observers know

24:13.974 --> 24:17.810
that we're in the lab.

24:17.844 --> 24:19.478
How?
Who told you that?

24:19.512 --> 24:20.812
Somebody I trust.

24:20.847 --> 24:22.314
We don't have time.

24:22.348 --> 24:23.415
<i>We cannot leave the lab.</i>

24:23.449 --> 24:24.616
Without the tapes,

24:24.651 --> 24:27.352
we have nothing.

24:27.387 --> 24:28.420
Forget the blueprints.

24:28.454 --> 24:29.755
Forget the rocks
from the mine.

24:29.789 --> 24:31.457
Forget whatever is in the tomb.

24:31.491 --> 24:32.758
None of it means anything

24:32.792 --> 24:33.959
without the plan.

24:33.993 --> 24:35.761
There goes the world.

24:35.795 --> 24:38.263
The world ending.

24:39.966 --> 24:41.166
Once they see we've been here,
we'll never be able

24:41.200 --> 24:42.434
to set foot
in the lab again.

24:42.468 --> 24:44.269
I have an idea.

24:44.303 --> 24:47.505
<i>Walter, we need</i>
<i>to re-Amber the lab.</i>

25:01.920 --> 25:05.122
There's nothing here.

25:05.156 --> 25:07.524
<i>It's just an ambered lab.</i>

25:18.570 --> 25:20.271
<i>Control, the building</i>
<i>is secure.</i>

25:20.305 --> 25:21.939
<i>1-6 heading back down.</i>

25:21.974 --> 25:23.741
<i>Copy that. Confirm.</i>
<i>Return to base.</i>

25:37.623 --> 25:39.758
No one has been
in that lab.

25:39.792 --> 25:42.861
The reading from the prisoner
was deceptive.

25:42.895 --> 25:44.496
How is that possible?

25:51.505 --> 25:55.108
Somehow she hid her thoughts
from us,

25:55.142 --> 25:59.512
<i>deceived our readings.</i>

26:01.482 --> 26:04.684
Perhaps others can as well.

26:09.856 --> 26:12.325
<i>Still on watch.</i>

26:12.359 --> 26:15.361
<i>You're relieved then.</i>

26:15.395 --> 26:18.664
Perimeter.

26:18.698 --> 26:20.866
Hi.

26:20.901 --> 26:22.335
Perhaps you can help me.

26:22.369 --> 26:24.738
I'm trying to get
to Kennebunkport, Maine.

26:27.342 --> 26:29.443
Let me see
your travel authorization.

26:29.477 --> 26:33.781
Of course. Thing is, I've been
driving around in circles.

26:33.815 --> 26:36.217
<i>I was hoping you might help me</i>
<i>with these directions.</i>

26:36.251 --> 26:37.318
I will handle this.

26:37.353 --> 26:38.887
The thing is,
I'm a bit lost.

26:42.625 --> 26:46.561
You electrocuted me.

26:46.596 --> 26:49.664
Your authorization--
now.

26:49.699 --> 26:54.503
Of course.

26:54.537 --> 26:57.439
<i>Here we are.</i>

27:12.989 --> 27:15.257
They're gonna meet us
around back.

27:15.291 --> 27:19.028
Here we go.

27:42.016 --> 27:43.550
All right, Walter.

27:43.585 --> 27:45.252
You're up.

27:45.286 --> 27:49.223
Where is it?

27:51.893 --> 27:54.662
<i>There.</i>

27:54.696 --> 27:56.130
Kilroy?

27:56.164 --> 27:59.300
I drew that.
It must be in the vent.

28:06.875 --> 28:08.076
There's a line.

28:08.110 --> 28:10.779
It's got something heavy.

28:10.813 --> 28:13.615
It's the tube.

28:23.292 --> 28:27.194
Let's go.

28:30.198 --> 28:32.734
<i>Peter!</i>

28:32.768 --> 28:34.603
Unh!

28:34.637 --> 28:35.804
Unh!

28:38.541 --> 28:40.308
There!

29:12.210 --> 29:14.678
I'm in.
Go, go, go.

30:11.554 --> 30:13.321
<i>What's written on it, Walter?</i>

30:13.356 --> 30:15.323
It's some kind of physics.

30:15.358 --> 30:17.559
It's beyond anything
I've ever seen.

30:17.593 --> 30:19.928
I don't understand.

30:19.962 --> 30:21.463
Well, Walter,
it's your handwriting,

30:21.497 --> 30:23.465
so, even if it was wiped
from your mind,

30:23.499 --> 30:26.101
you must have understood it
at some point.

30:26.135 --> 30:28.302
Perhaps it was dictated
to me.

30:28.337 --> 30:30.538
By September? You think
he gave you these equations?

30:30.572 --> 30:32.674
I don't know.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.276
Do you think you'll be able
to figure it out?

30:34.310 --> 30:35.977
Don't you understand?
This is Greek to me,

30:36.012 --> 30:37.245
except that I read Greek.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.347
This is Aramaic to me.

30:39.381 --> 30:42.217
<i>Not the western dialect.</i>
<i>I do speak a little.</i>

30:42.251 --> 30:43.651
<i>Walter?</i>

30:43.685 --> 30:45.086
I don't know what this is.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.620
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

30:46.621 --> 30:48.155
Okay, well, we should get back
to the lab.

30:48.323 --> 30:51.658
Not yet.

30:52.795 --> 30:56.731
Somebody wants to see you.

31:23.057 --> 31:25.326
Agent Dunham.

31:28.129 --> 31:30.830
Phillip.

31:46.914 --> 31:49.615
It's good to see you,
Dr. Bishop.

31:49.650 --> 31:52.318
Peter.

31:52.353 --> 31:56.756
I asked her not to tell you
in case...

31:56.790 --> 32:00.026
We were read.

32:02.229 --> 32:05.097
When I heard
that you were back,

32:05.132 --> 32:08.367
I tried not to,
but I had to see you.

32:13.874 --> 32:16.208
Five years ago,
I got called

32:16.243 --> 32:18.744
to a crime scene
outside the city,

32:18.779 --> 32:21.547
<i>and I saw Etta</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

32:21.581 --> 32:23.915
<i>And, even though she was</i>
<i>turned away from me,</i>

32:23.950 --> 32:27.052
I could have sworn
I was looking at you.

32:31.190 --> 32:32.723
<i>It wasn't until I told her</i>
<i>who I was</i>

32:32.758 --> 32:34.458
that she admitted the truth,

32:34.493 --> 32:36.060
that she was your daughter.

32:36.094 --> 32:38.796
Once I knew, I had her
transferred into my section.

32:38.831 --> 32:41.766
<i>I had a mind</i>
<i>I was gonna look after her,</i>

32:41.800 --> 32:44.302
but she taught me.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.705
<i>She recruited me</i>
<i>in the resistance,</i>

32:46.739 --> 32:50.443
taught me how to block them
from reading my thoughts.

32:50.477 --> 32:53.079
How long did that take?

32:53.113 --> 32:56.883
Nearly a year.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.819
They used
an airborne toxin.

32:59.854 --> 33:01.621
It hyperactivates
a protein

33:01.655 --> 33:05.425
that generates scar tissue.

33:05.459 --> 33:08.394
Barbaric.

33:15.302 --> 33:17.804
What was their purpose here?

33:17.838 --> 33:19.272
They took something

33:19.306 --> 33:20.673
<i>that was hidden inside.</i>

33:20.708 --> 33:22.809
What, we don't know.

33:22.843 --> 33:24.244
Captain Windmark.

33:24.278 --> 33:25.746
Yes.

33:25.780 --> 33:28.081
One of our men died
holding this.

33:33.788 --> 33:35.989
I think we're gonna be able
to find them.

33:41.496 --> 33:44.598
HK pistols
with rechargeable power cells.

33:44.632 --> 33:45.866
Pulse rifles,
motion sensors,

33:45.900 --> 33:47.234
scent cones.

33:47.269 --> 33:49.636
Anti-matter batons?

33:49.671 --> 33:50.971
<i>Fourth gen.</i>
<i>Delayed fuse.</i>

33:51.005 --> 33:52.706
Blast radius
of 100 meters.

33:52.741 --> 33:54.842
And, once it's armed,
it can't be deactivated,

33:54.876 --> 33:56.911
so when you use it, make sure
you don't stick around.

33:56.945 --> 33:58.346
How on earth
did you get this stuff?

33:58.380 --> 33:59.480
It wasn't simple.

33:59.515 --> 34:03.217
Tell Anil he owes me.

34:05.020 --> 34:07.721
Seeing you makes me realize
how much I miss Boston.

34:07.756 --> 34:10.891
Maybe I'll put in
for a transfer.

34:14.094 --> 34:17.530
It's all right.
I've apprehended them.

34:19.867 --> 34:20.833
They found you.

34:20.868 --> 34:25.405
<i>How?</i>

34:25.438 --> 34:26.739
They put a tracker on us.

34:26.774 --> 34:29.043
That loyalist
before we drove off.

34:29.077 --> 34:30.577
<i>You can't let 'em</i>
<i>find you here with us.</i>

34:30.612 --> 34:31.945
You won't make it by car.

34:31.980 --> 34:33.746
<i>Run.</i>

34:35.349 --> 34:38.652
Protect the plan
at all costs.

34:39.853 --> 34:41.353
<i>Peter!</i>

34:47.060 --> 34:50.496
Go!
Get out of here!

35:24.976 --> 35:26.644
We can't stay here.

35:26.678 --> 35:27.811
The far end.

35:27.846 --> 35:29.847
Down there.

35:46.331 --> 35:48.599
There.

35:55.008 --> 35:56.875
They know we're in here.

35:56.910 --> 36:00.546
Cover every entrance.

36:19.166 --> 36:21.000
Walter, run.
I'll cover you.

36:31.044 --> 36:32.577
Cover me
while I get to the stairs.

36:32.612 --> 36:33.778
We've got to go back
for them.

36:33.813 --> 36:35.347
We will.
We're gonna double back.

36:35.382 --> 36:36.682
<i>Ready?</i>

36:36.716 --> 36:39.385
Go!

36:44.825 --> 36:46.358
Walter!

36:46.393 --> 36:47.459
Go, go!

36:47.494 --> 36:49.495
On your six.
Clear it, clear it.

36:49.529 --> 36:50.996
Move, move!

37:41.617 --> 37:43.451
Walter?

37:43.486 --> 37:46.955
Peter?

37:48.824 --> 37:50.992
Unh!

37:56.599 --> 37:59.835
He bought the necklace
for you.

37:59.869 --> 38:03.505
For what purpose?

38:03.539 --> 38:05.907
I would like to know.

38:32.033 --> 38:34.168
Love.

38:53.455 --> 38:56.657
You never know
when to give up.

39:05.934 --> 39:08.069
Etta.

39:39.535 --> 39:41.336
Etta.

39:47.410 --> 39:49.611
No.
No, no, no.

39:49.646 --> 39:52.714
Henrietta,
look at me, okay?

39:52.749 --> 39:53.982
You're going to be okay.

39:54.017 --> 39:56.652
Etta?
But we have to move you, okay?

39:56.686 --> 39:59.054
No.
There's no point.

39:59.089 --> 40:00.889
We're not gonna leave you here.

40:00.924 --> 40:03.725
You have to.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.827
You won't make it
with me.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.695
I'll slow you down.

40:18.242 --> 40:20.310
You have to leave.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.036
Etta.

40:33.692 --> 40:39.663
I love you so much.

40:40.802 --> 40:43.328
I know.

40:56.648 --> 40:58.550
No.

40:58.584 --> 40:59.517
No, no.

40:59.551 --> 41:00.651
No.
I can't leave you.

41:00.686 --> 41:02.787
Not again.

41:02.821 --> 41:05.656
No. No.

41:05.690 --> 41:08.959
<i>Son, we have to go.</i>

41:20.672 --> 41:23.507
We're sweeping
buildings two and three now,

41:23.542 --> 41:24.875
but there's no sign of them.

41:24.910 --> 41:29.480
Love.

41:29.514 --> 41:31.482
They would go back for her.

41:39.457 --> 41:41.859
<i>You were wrong.</i>

41:45.030 --> 41:46.797
The necklace.

42:15.994 --> 42:18.495
We need to leave.

42:30.475 --> 42:34.111
She's gone, son.
We have to go.

42:43.255 --> 42:45.389
She's gone, son.
