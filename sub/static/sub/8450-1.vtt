WEBVTT

01:21.329 --> 01:22.990
Thorny.

01:31.139 --> 01:33.505
You call this a report card?

01:33.541 --> 01:36.305
What kind of marks is these?

01:36.344 --> 01:39.313
How you gonna go to college
with marks like these?

01:39.347 --> 01:40.609
I don't want to go to college.

01:40.648 --> 01:42.309
I want to work
in the shop with you.

01:42.350 --> 01:44.113
You want to work
in the shop with me, huh?

01:44.152 --> 01:46.017
Listen to me.

01:46.054 --> 01:48.818
I said it once,
and I'll say it again...

01:48.857 --> 01:51.655
I don't care how rich
or successful a man is...

01:51.693 --> 01:54.594
if he don't got an education,
he's got nothing.

01:54.629 --> 01:57.598
- I tried, Pop. I can't do it.
- Then try harder!

02:02.871 --> 02:06.432
You can do anything in life
you want to do.

02:06.474 --> 02:10.638
Remember... you're a Meloni.

04:20.975 --> 04:22.943
Hi there.
Are you a large person?

04:22.977 --> 04:25.605
Pleasantly plump? A little
on the hefty side, perhaps?

04:25.647 --> 04:27.979
Well, let's face it.
Are you fat?

04:28.016 --> 04:29.984
When you go jogging,
do you leave potholes?

04:30.018 --> 04:32.213
When you make love,
do you have to give directions?

04:32.253 --> 04:34.517
At the zoo, do elephants
throw you peanuts?

04:34.555 --> 04:36.580
Do you look at a menu
and say, "OK"?

04:36.624 --> 04:38.421
Well, now you can
eat all you want...

04:38.459 --> 04:40.393
because at Thornton Melon's
Tall and Fat stores...

04:40.428 --> 04:41.656
we've got you covered.

04:41.696 --> 04:44.256
That's right... fine woolen
and woolen blend suits...

04:44.299 --> 04:46.426
and sport coats
in all the larger sizes...

04:46.467 --> 04:50.164
husky, stout, extra-stout
and the new Hindenburg line.

04:50.204 --> 04:52.764
And for you ladies,
we have caftans, muumuus...

04:52.807 --> 04:55.799
and our own exclusive A-frame
in all colors and patterns.

04:55.843 --> 04:58.403
Yes, we have
miles and miles of fabric.

04:58.446 --> 05:00.414
So take it from me,
Thornton Melon...

05:00.448 --> 05:03.940
if you want to look thin,
you hang out with fat people.

05:03.985 --> 05:07.716
Thornton Melon's Tall and Fat...
150 locations across America.

05:07.755 --> 05:10.280
Lou, did you see the new spot?

05:10.325 --> 05:11.451
Yeah, I seen it.

05:11.492 --> 05:12.789
Do I look fat in it?

05:12.827 --> 05:14.488
You could lose
a couple of pounds.

05:14.529 --> 05:17.828
I gotta get bigger actors.

05:20.401 --> 05:23.734
Pocahontas, how are you?
Ophelia, hold some of my calls.

05:23.771 --> 05:26.171
Yes, sir, Mr. Melon.

05:29.177 --> 05:30.144
Good morning, everyone.

05:30.178 --> 05:32.305
Morning.

05:32.347 --> 05:34.008
Take it easy, will ya?

05:34.048 --> 05:37.540
And don't get any on the walls.

05:37.585 --> 05:39.746
OK, folks. What's up?

05:39.787 --> 05:41.846
Mr. Melon,
we have a serious offer...

05:41.889 --> 05:44.858
on your commercial property
in south Florida...

05:44.892 --> 05:46.883
and we feel you should sell.

05:46.928 --> 05:49.692
No. Hold it for one more year,
take the depreciation...

05:49.731 --> 05:52.291
then transfer title
to the California Corporation.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.528
Show it as a capital gain.
We should do great.

05:57.372 --> 05:58.566
What else?

05:58.606 --> 06:00.870
The toy division has come up
with a new doll idea...

06:00.908 --> 06:03.536
to go along with our
children's clothing line.

06:03.578 --> 06:06.376
We call them Melon Patch Kids.

06:06.414 --> 06:08.712
Now, the competition
exploits the notion...

06:08.750 --> 06:11.480
that their dolls are orphans.

06:11.519 --> 06:14.750
The Melon Patch Kids
are not orphans.

06:14.789 --> 06:16.950
They're abandoned.

06:16.991 --> 06:18.458
We think it's a winner.

06:18.493 --> 06:19.790
OK, go with it.

06:19.827 --> 06:22.193
But keep the unit cost
under five bucks.

06:22.230 --> 06:25.393
Last year, we took a bath
on those Chubby Tubby Tub toys.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.867
- Jason's on the phone.
- Jason.

06:27.902 --> 06:30.427
OK, everybody, take a break.

06:30.471 --> 06:34.601
Excuse me, Mr. Melon,
but we have a very long agenda.

06:34.642 --> 06:37.770
- Later. My son's on the phone.
- But, Mr. Melon!

06:37.812 --> 06:39.803
Beat it, punk.

06:42.650 --> 06:43.810
Jason, how are you?

06:43.851 --> 06:45.785
How you doin'?
How's the diving going?

06:45.820 --> 06:48.584
Oh, it's great.
We just finished up practice.

06:48.623 --> 06:50.818
Oh, keep it up, keep it up!
And the fraternity...

06:50.858 --> 06:52.826
I'll bet you're having fun
in the fraternity, huh?

06:52.860 --> 06:55.920
What do you think?
Yeah, it's great.

06:55.963 --> 06:57.555
Oh, that's great.

06:57.598 --> 07:00.158
You're not doing too much,
are you? You studying?

07:00.201 --> 07:02.465
Well, right now,
we're between semesters...

07:02.503 --> 07:04.471
so classes don't start up
again for another week.

07:04.505 --> 07:06.769
No classes? Then come home.

07:06.808 --> 07:08.571
Tonight, your mother and I
are having a big party.

07:08.609 --> 07:09.974
It's our fifth anniversary.

07:10.011 --> 07:14.277
Whoa, Dad. She's not my mother,
she's your wife...

07:14.315 --> 07:16.476
and I don't get the feeling
she wants me around.

07:16.517 --> 07:19.008
OK, let's not start that again.

07:19.053 --> 07:21.351
I'll tell you what.
I'll come up there to see you.

07:21.389 --> 07:23.357
No. Bad. Bad idea.

07:23.391 --> 07:25.382
I got this big dive meet
coming up.

07:25.426 --> 07:27.758
I gotta practice. I wouldn't
have any time to see you.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.821
- It's a rotten time.
- OK. I understand.

07:30.865 --> 07:32.025
Look, Dad, I promise...

07:32.066 --> 07:34.330
I'll come down for a visit
next break I get, OK?

07:34.368 --> 07:37.269
All right?
Look, I gotta go, OK?

07:37.305 --> 07:38.431
OK, Jason.

07:38.473 --> 07:40.498
Take care of yourself.
I love you.

07:40.541 --> 07:43.567
Yeah, I love you, too.
All right. Bye-bye.

07:43.611 --> 07:45.579
Melon, I told you
to clean my locker.

07:45.613 --> 07:47.205
If it's too much for you...

07:47.248 --> 07:49.079
we'll get ourselves
a new towel boy.

07:49.116 --> 07:53.177
Right. Look, I'm sorry, Chas.
I'll get on it as soon as I can.

08:10.104 --> 08:11.332
Home sweet home.

08:11.372 --> 08:14.170
- I liked the old house better.
- So did I.

08:14.208 --> 08:15.835
I liked the old wife
better, too.

08:15.877 --> 08:18.812
Lay off Vanessa.
She gives great headache.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.973
Lou, I can't believe it.
Married five years.

08:21.015 --> 08:22.915
Seems like yesterday.

08:22.950 --> 08:25.475
And you know what a lousy day
yesterday was.

08:30.258 --> 08:33.091
Please don't throw your clothes
on the Breuer chair.

08:33.126 --> 08:36.062
How come all our furniture
has names?

08:36.097 --> 08:38.565
I have absolutely
nothing to wear.

08:38.599 --> 08:40.760
You got six closets
full of nothing to wear.

08:40.801 --> 08:43.668
Are you saying
I spend too much money?

08:43.703 --> 08:45.569
You, spend too much money? No.

08:45.606 --> 08:49.337
Lots of people go to Switzerland
to get their watch fixed.

08:49.377 --> 08:52.107
You have no taste, Thornton.

08:52.146 --> 08:54.205
You're right.
I married you, didn't I?

08:54.248 --> 08:55.545
I don't have time to argue.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.050
Our friends will be here
any minute.

08:57.084 --> 08:58.415
You mean your friends.

08:58.452 --> 09:01.319
They are my friends,
and I'd like to keep them.

09:01.355 --> 09:03.255
So please,
just behave yourself tonight.

09:03.291 --> 09:06.192
Don't worry. If the roast beef
is right, they'll be back.

09:11.566 --> 09:13.830
Jennifer, you look divine.

09:13.868 --> 09:16.701
And, Peter, I thought
you were still in Portofino.

09:16.737 --> 09:19.604
Why haven't you called?

09:19.640 --> 09:22.234
- She's a lovely gal.
- Oh, yes, she is.

09:22.276 --> 09:24.904
Oh, Ramon,
you look fantastic.

09:24.946 --> 09:27.244
I thought you were still
in Tijuana.

09:27.281 --> 09:30.341
- Excuse me, señor?
- Nothing. It's all right.

09:30.384 --> 09:32.909
- Gimme a beer.
- I'm sorry, señor.

09:32.954 --> 09:35.787
All we have is martinis
and champagne.

09:35.823 --> 09:38.053
My own house,
I can't get a beer.

09:38.092 --> 09:41.584
Mrs. Melon gave us
strict orders... no cerveza.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.995
It's all right.
I'll get it myself.

10:00.881 --> 10:02.348
Hey! Adam and evil.

10:04.986 --> 10:06.851
Mr. Melon.

10:06.887 --> 10:08.787
We was just...

10:08.823 --> 10:11.815
Iooking for some
cocktail napkins.

10:11.859 --> 10:13.656
Where? Under her dress?

10:13.694 --> 10:15.491
You're impossible.

10:15.529 --> 10:16.860
And you're easy.

10:21.002 --> 10:23.402
I love Klimt, don't you?

10:23.437 --> 10:26.600
Mr. Melon, your wife
was just showing us her Klimt.

10:26.641 --> 10:29.542
You too, huh? She's showin' it
to everybody.

10:29.577 --> 10:31.807
- She's very proud of it.
- I'm proud of mine, too.

10:31.846 --> 10:33.939
I don't wave it around
at parties.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.472
- It's an exceptional painting.
- Oh, the painting.

10:36.517 --> 10:39.179
Yeah. Drink up,
enjoy yourself, huh?

10:44.659 --> 10:46.889
I hate small food, you know?

11:11.152 --> 11:13.120
Hey, buddy,
come here, will you?

11:13.154 --> 11:15.088
Put your hand
right over there, will you?

11:15.122 --> 11:17.113
I learned this in Europe.

11:23.497 --> 11:26.057
Look out, coming through.
Hot stuff. Look out.

11:28.669 --> 11:30.637
I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Stuyvesant.

11:30.671 --> 11:31.763
Right, right.

11:31.806 --> 11:33.330
- How do you do?
- Thornton!

11:36.143 --> 11:38.441
How you doin'?

11:40.781 --> 11:42.772
Hi there, sir. How are you?

11:45.252 --> 11:47.812
Never mind. I got my own here.
It's all right.

11:50.291 --> 11:53.283
Millicent, you look charming.
I love your dress.

11:53.327 --> 11:55.192
Don't you, Thornton?

11:55.229 --> 11:57.197
It's such a lovely shade
of green.

11:57.231 --> 12:00.598
Yeah. If that dress had pockets,
you'd look like a pool table.

12:00.634 --> 12:02.625
You should try
my Tall and Fat stores.

12:02.670 --> 12:03.898
No offense.

12:06.941 --> 12:09.933
May I speak to you
privately, please?

12:14.281 --> 12:16.272
Watch my sandwich, will you?

12:17.818 --> 12:19.945
I can't take any more of this!

12:19.987 --> 12:22.785
You've insulted our friends,
you've insulted me...

12:22.823 --> 12:25.053
and you've gone out of your way
to ruin this party.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.424
Party? Are you kiddin'?
It's a dog show out there.

12:27.461 --> 12:30.055
Your friends, they come here
for free food, free booze...

12:30.097 --> 12:32.190
and to suck up to you
for donations.

12:32.233 --> 12:35.225
You have no class, Thornton,
and I am tired of it.

12:35.269 --> 12:36.736
I want a divorce.

12:36.771 --> 12:39.331
Divorce. I knew
we had something in common.

12:39.373 --> 12:40.863
Here, sign these.

12:43.410 --> 12:46.470
I'm afraid it's not gonna be
that easy, honey.

12:46.514 --> 12:49.176
This is gonna cost you...
plenty!

12:49.216 --> 12:51.411
Oh, yeah?

12:51.452 --> 12:53.977
Let's talk about class
a minute, all right?

12:54.021 --> 12:55.989
Here's you and Giorgio
in the guest room.

12:56.023 --> 12:57.684
Classy, isn't it?

12:57.725 --> 12:59.556
Here's you and Giorgio
in the rumpus room.

12:59.593 --> 13:01.322
Another classy one, huh?

13:01.362 --> 13:04.229
This one I can't figure out.
There's you, there's Giorgio...

13:04.265 --> 13:06.358
what's with the midget
over here?

13:06.400 --> 13:08.800
Hey, wait! I got more!

13:21.182 --> 13:22.342
What happened in there?

13:22.383 --> 13:24.044
What happened?

13:24.084 --> 13:27.781
I got rid of Vanessa.
I feel like I just got paroled.

13:27.822 --> 13:30.017
I'll tell you what bothers me...

13:30.057 --> 13:32.389
I let her come
between me and Jason.

13:32.426 --> 13:35.520
Lou, pack our bags.

13:40.801 --> 13:43.235
We're going up to that college
to see my son!

14:20.374 --> 14:23.002
Boy, will Jason be surprised.

14:23.043 --> 14:26.012
Look, there's Greek letters.
That must be the house.

14:45.833 --> 14:47.767
Is that an "amigo"
or a unicorn?

14:47.801 --> 14:49.894
Beats me.
Don't you know any Greek?

14:49.937 --> 14:52.030
The only Greek I know owns
a coffee shop on State Street.

14:52.072 --> 14:54.597
Jimmy Pitsos, remember him?
He had an ugly wife...

14:54.642 --> 14:57.475
four ugly kids,
and good coffee.

14:57.511 --> 14:59.945
Wait here, I'll try this one.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.352
Hello, hello!

15:17.431 --> 15:19.922
Anybody here?

15:19.967 --> 15:22.800
Jason, where are you?

15:22.836 --> 15:25.566
Hey, I need some help here!

15:25.606 --> 15:28.837
Buddy, I'm talking to you.
I need some help here!

15:28.876 --> 15:31.902
Take it easy, honey!
I didn't see a thing.

15:31.946 --> 15:33.641
You're perfect.

15:33.681 --> 15:35.876
You jerk!

15:35.916 --> 15:38.043
Perfectly understandable,
Mr. Melon.

15:38.085 --> 15:40.679
It was an honest mistake.
Let's just call it a bad day.

15:40.721 --> 15:43.485
Yeah, but a great view.
You're all right, officer.

15:43.524 --> 15:45.048
Here, a little something
for the kids.

15:45.092 --> 15:47.322
- Take that, it's OK.
- I don't have any kids.

15:47.361 --> 15:49.329
No kids? Well, here,
get yourself some kids.

15:49.363 --> 15:51.593
Take it all, all right?
And just remember...

15:51.632 --> 15:54.157
the best thing about kids
is making 'em.

15:55.970 --> 15:58.165
Even if I do manage
to graduate... ha ha...

15:58.205 --> 16:00.605
what do I do then?
There's the private sector...

16:00.641 --> 16:02.734
but look how bad
the job market is.

16:02.776 --> 16:04.175
There's Valerie Desmond.

16:04.211 --> 16:05.974
See you guys.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.779
Look how tight
her ass is today.

16:11.819 --> 16:14.515
Oh, man. You think
there's any way...

16:14.555 --> 16:17.683
she would ever go out with me?

16:17.725 --> 16:20.023
- No.
- Oh, thanks.

16:20.060 --> 16:22.221
It's this whole stupid
capitalist system, you know?

16:22.262 --> 16:24.025
It's set up to heap rewards...

16:24.064 --> 16:25.656
on the advantaged
and the aggressive...

16:25.699 --> 16:27.724
and to make sure
that two regular schmoes...

16:27.768 --> 16:31.636
like you and me never get a date
with girls like Valerie Desmond.

16:31.672 --> 16:34.607
I hate the whole bourgeois
mentality of this school.

16:34.641 --> 16:36.609
Let me ask you
something else, man.

16:36.643 --> 16:38.873
Do you make this bullshit up
as you go along...

16:38.912 --> 16:41.403
- or do you actually read this?
- I read this. It's Karl Marx.

16:41.448 --> 16:43.814
Famous book.
"Proletarian Chicks in Bondage."

16:43.851 --> 16:46.319
It's a Condom House book.
Comes with a leather hood.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.014
Is that the one
with the pictures?

16:48.055 --> 16:49.352
- Can I borrow that?
- Let's move on.

16:49.390 --> 16:52.154
Well, no, it's, you know...

16:52.192 --> 16:54.387
Oh, yeah. Well, you know.

16:56.463 --> 16:59.694
Dad, what are you doin' here?

16:59.733 --> 17:02.133
I'm robbin' your room,
that's what I'm doin' here.

17:02.169 --> 17:03.932
We drive 300 miles
to see the kid...

17:03.971 --> 17:07.031
that's the greeting we get.
Come here, will ya?

17:08.442 --> 17:10.342
How ya doin' there?

17:10.377 --> 17:12.641
I'm sorry.
I'm really glad to see you...

17:12.679 --> 17:14.442
but I wish
I knew you were coming.

17:14.481 --> 17:15.811
I'll bet you did, huh?

17:15.848 --> 17:17.510
I looked for you
at that fraternity house.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.883
- They said you weren't a member.
- I can explain that.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.251
They also told me
you're not on the diving team.

17:21.288 --> 17:23.347
They said you were
the towel boy.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.722
- I can explain that, too.
- OK, explain it.

17:25.759 --> 17:28.592
- I lied.
- Great. That explains it, huh?

17:28.629 --> 17:31.757
Jason, you don't lie to me.
You lie to girls.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.292
Who's this?

17:34.334 --> 17:36.461
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my roommate.

17:36.503 --> 17:37.470
That's Derek Lutz.

17:37.504 --> 17:40.234
This is the dad,
and that's Lou.

17:40.274 --> 17:42.765
- Is that your real hair?
- What do you think?

17:42.810 --> 17:45.938
I think you're trying
to get back at your parents.

17:45.979 --> 17:48.106
Show me the campus.
I want to talk to you.

17:48.148 --> 17:49.308
Oh, good.

17:57.057 --> 17:59.082
Boy, what a great-lookin' place.

17:59.126 --> 18:00.889
When I used to dream
about going to college...

18:00.928 --> 18:02.555
this is the way
I always pictured it.

18:02.596 --> 18:04.689
Wait a minute. When did you
dream about going to college?

18:04.731 --> 18:07.996
When I used to fall asleep
in high school.

18:08.035 --> 18:09.969
Dad, I know how much
all this means to you...

18:10.003 --> 18:13.370
- and I'm sorry I lied to you.
- You don't have to lie to me.

18:13.407 --> 18:15.898
No matter what you do,
I'll love you just the same.

18:15.943 --> 18:17.342
Will you love me
no matter what?

18:17.377 --> 18:18.571
No matter what.

18:18.612 --> 18:21.308
- I'm droppin' out.
- You're droppin' out?

18:21.348 --> 18:23.942
You just got here.
You just started.

18:23.984 --> 18:25.952
I know,
but I'm not making it here.

18:25.986 --> 18:28.181
I don't fit in, you know?
I got one friend... Derek.

18:28.222 --> 18:30.247
He's got no friends.

18:30.290 --> 18:32.815
The girls don't like me,
the fraternities don't want me.

18:32.860 --> 18:34.418
The diving coach
won't even talk to me.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.486
Look at it this way...

18:36.530 --> 18:38.498
at least you're getting
an education.

18:38.532 --> 18:41.092
Dad, last semester
I got nothing but "Cs."

18:41.135 --> 18:42.932
A, B, C...
you're in the top three.

18:42.970 --> 18:44.562
What are you worrying about?

18:44.605 --> 18:46.436
I just think I'd be
a lot better off...

18:46.473 --> 18:48.031
gettin' a job or something.

18:48.075 --> 18:50.407
You never went to college.
Look how great you're doin'.

18:50.444 --> 18:53.038
Jason, I said it before
and I'll say it again.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.310
I don't care how rich
and successful a man is.

18:55.349 --> 18:56.941
Without an education,
he's nothing.

18:56.984 --> 18:59.316
I mean, stay in school.
Study harder.

18:59.353 --> 19:01.218
You can be whatever
you want to be.

19:01.255 --> 19:02.722
You want to be a loser,
be a loser.

19:02.756 --> 19:03.848
You want to be a winner,
be a winner.

19:03.891 --> 19:06.121
Jason, it's up to you.
You can do it.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.061
Remember, you're a Melon!

19:09.096 --> 19:13.226
Dad, that's easy for you to say.
You don't have to do any of it.

19:15.636 --> 19:17.968
OK, then.
I'll do it with you.

19:19.306 --> 19:20.796
What do you mean,
you'll do it with me?

19:20.841 --> 19:23.207
I mean just what I said.

19:23.243 --> 19:25.211
I'm going to college.
What do you think?

19:25.245 --> 19:27.713
What do I think?
I think you're nuts.

19:27.748 --> 19:31.548
Nuts, huh? Who made the rules?
Come here. I'm going to college!

19:31.585 --> 19:33.109
I'm going to college!

19:36.023 --> 19:38.617
Let me get this straight,
Mr. Melon.

19:38.659 --> 19:42.186
You wish to enter
this widely esteemed...

19:42.229 --> 19:44.663
Grand Lakes University of ours
as a freshman?

19:44.698 --> 19:46.495
That's right, Dean Martin.

19:47.634 --> 19:51.161
- Are you comfortable?
- I'm fine, yeah.

19:51.205 --> 19:53.264
Oh, the chair. I'm sorry.

19:56.343 --> 19:59.176
This is an awkward moment
for me, Mr. Melon...

19:59.213 --> 20:01.579
since I realize you're
a highly respected member...

20:01.615 --> 20:03.105
of our business community.

20:03.150 --> 20:05.983
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:06.019 --> 20:09.580
Our student body here
is handpicked by me...

20:09.623 --> 20:11.090
from the crème de la crème...

20:11.124 --> 20:14.252
of students all across
this great land of ours.

20:14.294 --> 20:16.319
That's one of the things
I like about this place.

20:16.363 --> 20:18.388
Yes. The point is, though...

20:18.432 --> 20:20.400
since you have
no high school diploma...

20:20.434 --> 20:23.870
and no transcripts of any kind,
no S.A.T. Scores...

20:23.904 --> 20:27.601
and you're 30 to 40 years older
than our average freshman...

20:27.641 --> 20:30.371
how can this university
ever see its way clear...

20:30.410 --> 20:32.810
to accept you as a student?

20:32.846 --> 20:35.406
As Calvin Coolidge once said...

20:35.449 --> 20:38.475
"The business of America
is business"...

20:38.518 --> 20:41.043
and the business of
an educational institution...

20:41.088 --> 20:43.716
such as ours
is to create young minds...

20:43.757 --> 20:45.657
that understand that
the business of America...

20:45.692 --> 20:49.389
is the kind of business
that it actually is.

20:49.429 --> 20:53.422
So, whatever it is that
I have said here today...

20:53.467 --> 20:58.097
the point is
that we are here to honor...

20:58.138 --> 21:01.232
our most generous benefactor...

21:01.275 --> 21:04.005
and newest freshman...

21:04.044 --> 21:05.807
the man who's
made it possible...

21:05.846 --> 21:08.747
for us to break ground
here today...

21:08.782 --> 21:11.080
Mr. Thornton Melon.

21:14.221 --> 21:16.587
Dean Martin, great speech.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.989
There's nothing like good,
clean business, huh?

21:19.026 --> 21:22.086
And a little monkey business.

21:22.129 --> 21:25.360
Oh, Philip. I'm so glad
you could make it.

21:25.399 --> 21:27.799
Mr. Melon, I'd like for you
to meet Dr. Philip Barbay...

21:27.834 --> 21:31.895
who's the dean
of our school of business.

21:31.938 --> 21:33.701
David, I just want
to get it on record...

21:33.740 --> 21:35.332
that I am totally against this.

21:35.375 --> 21:37.502
I don't think
that selling admission...

21:37.544 --> 21:39.603
to an obviously
unqualified student...

21:39.646 --> 21:42.137
is very ethical or honorable.

21:42.182 --> 21:45.709
Right, Phil,
but I'd just like to say...

21:45.752 --> 21:48.050
in all fairness
to Mr. Melon here...

21:48.088 --> 21:51.057
it was a really big check.

21:51.091 --> 21:53.184
It's a simple matter
of this man's presence...

21:53.226 --> 21:56.195
undermining the efforts
of our legitimate students...

21:56.229 --> 21:58.197
who are here as a result
of hard work.

21:58.231 --> 21:59.528
Hard work?

21:59.566 --> 22:02.262
Listen, Sherlock, while you were
tucked away up here...

22:02.302 --> 22:04.270
working on your ethics,
I was out there...

22:04.304 --> 22:06.329
busting my hump
in the real world.

22:06.373 --> 22:08.568
And the reason guys like you
got a place to teach...

22:08.608 --> 22:10.701
is 'cause guys like me
donate buildings.

22:10.744 --> 22:13.975
I wasn't speaking to you,
Mr. Melon.

22:20.954 --> 22:23.218
I don't think
Dr. Barbay understands...

22:23.256 --> 22:26.089
the actual amounts
that are involved here.

22:26.126 --> 22:30.358
Mr. Melon, will you take
the ceremonial shovel?

22:30.397 --> 22:31.364
Thank you.

22:31.398 --> 22:34.265
And dig into the symbolic dirt.

22:36.903 --> 22:41.863
I hereby dedicate
this building to... myself.

22:54.087 --> 22:56.078
Now, Dad, it's just like
we talked about.

22:56.123 --> 22:58.091
You sign up for whatever
interests you, OK?

22:58.125 --> 22:59.854
We're gonna get
on the astronomy line...

22:59.893 --> 23:01.884
before it closes up.
See you later.

23:03.697 --> 23:07.656
Look at this.
This is worse than the track.

23:07.701 --> 23:09.293
You want me to move
some people for you?

23:09.336 --> 23:10.394
No, don't push anybody around.

23:10.437 --> 23:13.031
This is college.
Let me think for a minute.

23:13.073 --> 23:14.665
What are you gonna do?

23:14.708 --> 23:17.074
Come on. I got an idea.

23:17.110 --> 23:18.077
Did you get
everything you want?

23:18.111 --> 23:20.807
I got the Latin
and the Sanskrit...

23:20.847 --> 23:22.474
but then they canceled
my Ancient Greek.

23:22.516 --> 23:24.484
Just blew my whole
dead languages motif.

23:24.518 --> 23:26.645
What are you looking at?

23:40.567 --> 23:42.967
You OK?

23:43.003 --> 23:46.530
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

23:46.573 --> 23:48.939
I'm just upset
because they closed botany.

23:48.975 --> 23:50.943
Those bastards!

23:50.977 --> 23:53.138
Well, I'm not that upset.

23:54.481 --> 23:57.211
At least, I won't be
if I get into astronomy.

23:57.250 --> 23:59.548
You want to cut
into line with us?

23:59.586 --> 24:00.644
'Cause we're already waiting.

24:00.687 --> 24:03.520
Yes. Yeah, I would.

24:03.557 --> 24:04.649
Great. All right.

24:08.562 --> 24:10.427
Oh, this is Derek.

24:10.464 --> 24:13.297
Hi.

24:13.333 --> 24:15.130
I'm Valerie Desmond.

24:15.168 --> 24:17.159
Yeah, I know.

24:18.538 --> 24:21.507
- I'm Jason Melon.
- Hi.

24:25.579 --> 24:27.809
- Hey, Valerie.
- Hi.

24:27.848 --> 24:29.315
God, you look great.

24:29.349 --> 24:31.943
Thanks. Are you taking
astronomy, too?

24:31.985 --> 24:33.885
Yeah, I guess so.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.979
I don't really want to.
I'm a business major.

24:36.022 --> 24:39.048
But for some reason,
they want us to take a science.

24:39.092 --> 24:41.060
You mind if I sneak
in the line with you?

24:41.094 --> 24:43.995
Actually, these guys were
nice enough to let me in...

24:44.030 --> 24:47.431
so it's really
up to them, I guess.

24:47.467 --> 24:49.230
Melon, buddy?

24:49.269 --> 24:51.760
Whaddaya say? Let me in, OK?

24:51.805 --> 24:54.239
I don't think so, Osbourne.

24:54.274 --> 24:56.333
Melon, your friend...
straighten him out.

24:56.376 --> 24:57.968
Look, Chas,
there's a lot of people waiting.

24:58.011 --> 25:00.605
It wouldn't really be fair.

25:00.647 --> 25:01.807
I'll tell you what.

25:01.848 --> 25:05.909
Maybe if you got a note
from each of these people...

25:05.952 --> 25:08.079
saying that it was all right,
then we'd reconsider...

25:08.121 --> 25:09.918
but until that day,
take a hike...

25:09.956 --> 25:13.050
you elitist fraternity scumbag.

25:16.730 --> 25:18.789
I won't forget this, Melon.

25:18.832 --> 25:20.595
I'll see you at the pool.

25:20.634 --> 25:21.999
- Bye, Val.
- Bye.

25:22.035 --> 25:23.627
Thank you. I'm dead.

25:23.670 --> 25:25.638
You're not gonna believe this!

25:25.672 --> 25:28.266
- You're kidding!
- I'm not kidding! Just go!

25:28.308 --> 25:29.969
He's out there!

25:40.153 --> 25:43.554
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

25:48.495 --> 25:49.894
Where is he?

25:49.930 --> 25:51.056
I don't know, kid.

25:51.097 --> 25:52.792
All I know is I'm supposed
to pick him up here.

25:52.832 --> 25:54.800
- When?
- Now.

25:54.834 --> 25:57.530
Come on, let's register.

26:06.212 --> 26:07.736
Hey, you guys
get everything you need?

26:07.781 --> 26:09.043
Oh, yeah, we got it.

26:09.082 --> 26:10.674
Good. What's with
the used books?

26:10.717 --> 26:13.117
- What's wrong with used books?
- They've already been read.

26:13.153 --> 26:14.950
And they've already been
underlined.

26:14.988 --> 26:16.216
That's the problem.

26:16.256 --> 26:18.486
The guy who underlined them
could have been a maniac.

26:18.525 --> 26:21.824
Get these guys some new books.

26:21.861 --> 26:24.796
Charge it to me, too.
Here, pick a card.

26:25.999 --> 26:28.832
And I'm taking four
of those school sweaters...

26:28.868 --> 26:31.564
a bunch of pennants,
some of those beer mugs...

26:31.605 --> 26:34.199
a few of these fuzz balls
you cheer with, and...

26:34.240 --> 26:37.471
Hey, folks, it's on me!
Shakespeare for everyone, OK?

26:39.079 --> 26:42.014
You, too, honey.
I'd like to tame your shrew.

26:42.048 --> 26:45.882
- Who is that?
- That is Mr. Thornton Melon...

26:45.919 --> 26:48.581
the world's oldest
living freshman...

26:48.622 --> 26:51.648
and the walking epitome of
the decline of modern education.

26:51.691 --> 26:54.091
The stupid clod thinks he can
buy his way out of the gutter.

26:54.127 --> 26:56.425
I don't think so.
He was just having fun.

26:56.463 --> 27:01.127
Oh, really? Well, I can't wait
to get him in my class.

27:01.167 --> 27:03.294
We'll see how much fun
he is then.

27:03.336 --> 27:04.496
Oh, Philip.

27:04.537 --> 27:07.563
Hey, Mr. M! You're all set.
We've been working all night.

27:07.607 --> 27:09.165
We got it all done.

27:09.209 --> 27:11.040
Thanks, Buzzy.
I appreciate it.

27:11.077 --> 27:14.376
Add a few hundred to the bill
and throw your boys a party.

27:14.414 --> 27:17.542
You know what you got, Mr. M?
You got class.

27:17.584 --> 27:20.781
It rubbed off from you, Buzzy.
Say hello to Sonia for me, huh?

27:20.820 --> 27:22.014
You got it.

27:22.055 --> 27:24.956
I want to talk to you
about my schedule.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.152
We'll go over it later.

27:39.973 --> 27:42.305
Well, boys,
what do you think?

27:42.342 --> 27:44.207
Got a hot tub in there!

27:44.244 --> 27:46.405
How can you study
if you're not relaxed?

27:46.446 --> 27:47.606
When's our first class?

27:47.647 --> 27:49.808
We got economics
tomorrow at 11:00.

27:49.849 --> 27:51.009
11:00? No good.

27:51.051 --> 27:53.212
I got a massage at 11:00.
Tell them to make it 2:00.

27:53.253 --> 27:56.416
No, Dad, you don't get it.

27:56.456 --> 28:00.586
They're not gonna reschedule
the classes around your massage.

28:00.627 --> 28:03.187
All right, 11:00.
But I'm gonna talk to that dean.

28:03.229 --> 28:05.720
These classes can be
a real inconvenience.

28:05.765 --> 28:08.233
All right, settle down, people.

28:08.268 --> 28:11.260
We've got a lot to cover,
and time is short.

28:15.075 --> 28:18.101
There are two kinds of people
in business today...

28:18.144 --> 28:20.112
the quick and the dead.

28:20.146 --> 28:23.274
So, rather than waste
your time this semester...

28:23.316 --> 28:25.750
with a lot of
useless theories...

28:25.785 --> 28:27.810
we're going to jump right in
with both feet...

28:27.854 --> 28:30.755
and create a fictional company
from the ground up.

28:30.790 --> 28:33.816
We'll construct
our physical plant...

28:33.860 --> 28:36.260
we'll set up
an efficient administrative...

28:36.296 --> 28:38.093
and executive structure...

28:38.131 --> 28:41.726
then we'll manufacture
our product and market it.

28:41.768 --> 28:44.430
I think you'll find it very
interesting and a lot of fun.

28:44.471 --> 28:48.032
So, let's start by looking
at construction costs...

28:48.074 --> 28:50.065
of our new factory.

28:50.110 --> 28:52.305
What's the product?

28:52.345 --> 28:53.539
That is immaterial...

28:53.580 --> 28:55.707
for the purposes
of our discussion here...

28:55.749 --> 28:57.512
but if it makes you happy...

28:57.550 --> 28:59.711
let's say we're making
tape recorders.

28:59.753 --> 29:01.744
Tape recorders?
Are you kiddin'?

29:01.788 --> 29:05.246
The Japs will kill us
on the labor costs.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.259
OK, fine.

29:07.293 --> 29:10.057
Then let's just say
they're widgets.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.996
What's a widget?

29:12.031 --> 29:15.330
It's a fictional product.
It doesn't matter.

29:15.368 --> 29:17.427
Doesn't matter.
Tell that to the bank.

29:17.470 --> 29:19.597
Take it easy.
It's the first day.

29:19.639 --> 29:23.097
On the board,
you will see a cost analysis...

29:23.143 --> 29:25.737
for construction of
a 30,000 square-foot facility...

29:25.779 --> 29:28.475
which will encompass
both factory and office space...

29:28.515 --> 29:31.416
and is fully serviced
by all utilities...

29:31.451 --> 29:34.614
a railroad spur line
and a four-bay shipping dock.

29:34.654 --> 29:37.748
Hold it, hold it. Why build?
You're better off leasing...

29:37.791 --> 29:40.259
at a buck and a quarter,
a buck and a half a square foot.

29:40.293 --> 29:42.989
Take your down payment
and put it into CDs...

29:43.029 --> 29:45.259
or something else you can roll
over every couple of months.

29:45.298 --> 29:46.822
Thank you, Mr. Melon...

29:46.866 --> 29:49.664
but we'll be concentrating
on finance...

29:49.702 --> 29:52.262
a little later in the term.

29:52.305 --> 29:54.432
For the time being,
let's just concentrate...

29:54.474 --> 29:56.806
on the construction figures,
shall we?

29:56.843 --> 30:00.040
You'll see the final bottom line
requires the factoring in...

30:00.079 --> 30:02.547
of not just the material
and construction costs...

30:02.582 --> 30:07.542
but also the architects' fees
and the cost of land servicing.

30:07.587 --> 30:09.919
Oh, you left out
a bunch of stuff.

30:09.956 --> 30:11.924
Oh, really?

30:11.958 --> 30:13.983
Like what, for instance?

30:14.027 --> 30:17.326
First of all, you have to grease
the local politicians...

30:17.363 --> 30:19.558
for the sudden zoning problems
that always come up.

30:19.599 --> 30:22.193
Then there's the kickbacks
to the carpenters.

30:22.235 --> 30:24.203
And if you plan on using
any cement in this building...

30:24.237 --> 30:25.727
I'm sure the teamsters
would like to have...

30:25.772 --> 30:27.831
a little chat with you,
and that'll cost you.

30:27.874 --> 30:30.536
Don't forget a little something
for the building inspectors.

30:30.577 --> 30:33.671
There's the long-term costs,
such as waste disposal.

30:33.713 --> 30:35.738
I don't know if you're familiar
with who runs that business...

30:35.782 --> 30:37.841
but I assure you
it's not the boy scouts.

30:37.884 --> 30:39.249
That will be quite enough,
Mr. Melon.

30:39.285 --> 30:41.412
Maybe bribes and kickbacks...

30:41.454 --> 30:44.821
and Mafia payoffs
are how you do business...

30:44.858 --> 30:47.622
but they are not part of
the legitimate business world...

30:47.660 --> 30:49.560
and they're certainly
not part of anything...

30:49.596 --> 30:52.064
I'm teaching in this class.
Do I make myself clear?

30:52.098 --> 30:54.931
Sorry. Just trying to help.
That's all.

30:54.968 --> 31:00.031
Now, notwithstanding
Mr. Melon's input...

31:00.073 --> 31:04.203
the next question for us is
where to build our factory.

31:04.244 --> 31:06.678
How about Fantasyland?

31:10.216 --> 31:13.117
My first class.
I did good, huh?

31:13.152 --> 31:15.552
You better cool it
with Dr. Barbay.

31:15.588 --> 31:17.351
Dr. Barbay, he don't know dick.

31:17.390 --> 31:19.324
He really tells it
like it ain't.

31:19.359 --> 31:21.919
Know what he knows how to do?
Flunk you.

31:21.961 --> 31:24.327
Flunk me? Flunk him.

31:24.364 --> 31:27.128
Great attitude. Do you know
where your next class is?

31:27.166 --> 31:30.135
Contemporary American history.
Professor Turgeson.

31:30.169 --> 31:32.603
- Turgeson?
- You know him? Is he good?

31:32.639 --> 31:34.971
Well, he's really committed.

31:35.008 --> 31:37.238
In fact, I think he was.
Just keep your head down...

31:37.277 --> 31:39.040
and your mouth shut.
You should be all right.

31:39.078 --> 31:40.602
- I'll see you in English.
- All right.

31:40.647 --> 31:44.139
Welcome to Contemporary
American history.

31:44.183 --> 31:46.378
I'm Professor Turgeson.

31:46.419 --> 31:48.887
I know a lot of people
think history is just facts...

31:48.922 --> 31:52.915
just information about the past,
but not me.

31:52.959 --> 31:56.258
I hold history
very sacred. Sacred.

31:56.296 --> 31:58.787
The way a farmer looks at
the Earth and holds it sacred.

31:58.831 --> 32:00.822
The way a Christian
takes the Bible...

32:00.867 --> 32:02.129
and he holds it sacred.

32:02.168 --> 32:05.103
The way a lot of people
hold their marriage sacred.

32:05.138 --> 32:07.470
That's how I feel about it.
So why don't we dive right in...

32:07.507 --> 32:10.271
by interpreting
one of the easiest events...

32:10.310 --> 32:13.507
in the last twenty years
of American history.

32:13.546 --> 32:15.980
Now, can someone tell me...

32:16.015 --> 32:20.452
why, in 1975, we pulled
our troops out of Vietnam?

32:21.988 --> 32:24.752
The failure of Vietnamization
to win popular support...

32:24.791 --> 32:26.759
caused an ongoing erosion
of confidence...

32:26.793 --> 32:30.024
in the various American...
but illegal... Saigon regimes.

32:34.434 --> 32:35.628
Is she right?

32:37.837 --> 32:39.395
'Cause I know
that's the popular version...

32:39.439 --> 32:40.770
of what went on there.

32:40.807 --> 32:42.866
I know a lot of people
like to believe that.

32:42.909 --> 32:44.934
I wish I could,
but I was there.

32:44.978 --> 32:46.468
I wasn't here in a classroom...

32:46.512 --> 32:48.036
hoping I was right,
thinking about it.

32:48.081 --> 32:50.811
I was up to my knees
in rice paddies...

32:50.850 --> 32:53.318
with guns that didn't work,
going up against Charlie...

32:53.353 --> 32:56.288
slugging it out with him,
while pussies like you...

32:56.322 --> 32:59.189
were back here partyin',
puttin' headbands on...

32:59.225 --> 33:02.160
doin' drugs, listening
to the goddamn Beatle albums!

33:04.897 --> 33:06.831
Hey, Professor,
take it easy, will ya?

33:06.866 --> 33:09.733
These kids were in grade school
at the time.

33:09.769 --> 33:11.066
And me...

33:11.104 --> 33:13.937
I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover.

33:17.810 --> 33:20.711
Well, I didn't know you wanted
to get involved...

33:20.747 --> 33:24.114
with the discussion,
Mr. Helper.

33:24.150 --> 33:27.586
But since you want to help,
maybe you can help me, OK?

33:27.620 --> 33:29.520
You remember that thing
we had about thirty years ago...

33:29.555 --> 33:30.920
called the Korean conflict?

33:30.957 --> 33:34.154
Yeah. Where we failed
to achieve victory.

33:34.193 --> 33:36.593
How come we didn't cross
the 38th parallel...

33:36.629 --> 33:39.689
and push those rice-eaters back
to the Great Wall of China...

33:39.732 --> 33:41.723
and take it apart
brick by brick...

33:41.768 --> 33:44.202
and nuke them back into
the fuckin' stone age forever?

33:44.237 --> 33:47.695
How come? Tell me?
Why? Say it! Say it!

33:47.740 --> 33:49.901
All right, I'll say it.

33:49.942 --> 33:52.035
'Cause Truman was too much
of a pussy wimp...

33:52.078 --> 33:55.707
to let MacArthur go in and blow
out those commie bastards!

33:57.417 --> 34:00.545
Good answer. Good answer.

34:01.988 --> 34:04.752
I like the way you think.

34:04.791 --> 34:08.192
I'm gonna be watching you.

34:10.396 --> 34:13.661
Good teacher.
He really seems to care.

34:13.699 --> 34:16.031
About what, I have no idea.

34:17.103 --> 34:18.967
College is all right,
I'll tell you that.

34:19.005 --> 34:21.337
Hey, buddy, be my guest.
Here's a pen.

34:21.373 --> 34:25.208
Boys, here's a couple of pens,
in case you learn how to write.

34:25.244 --> 34:27.507
- I know you.
- Oh, yeah? Here's a pen.

34:27.547 --> 34:29.777
You do those
obnoxious commercials.

34:29.815 --> 34:31.147
You're tall and fat.

34:31.184 --> 34:35.177
Yeah, you're short and ugly.
Give me the pen back, will ya?

34:35.221 --> 34:37.451
Honey, here's a pen.

34:37.489 --> 34:39.889
Boys, how are ya?

35:01.714 --> 35:03.147
"And Gibraltar is a girl...

35:03.182 --> 35:05.844
"where I was a flower
of the mountain.

35:05.885 --> 35:07.853
"Yes, when I put
the rose in my hair...

35:07.887 --> 35:09.354
"like the
Andalusian girls used.

35:09.388 --> 35:11.447
"Or shall I wear red?

35:11.491 --> 35:14.324
"Yes. And how he kissed me
under the Moorish wall...

35:14.360 --> 35:15.486
"and I thought...

35:15.528 --> 35:17.462
"well, as well him as another.

35:17.497 --> 35:19.795
"And then I ask him
with my eyes to ask again.

35:19.832 --> 35:23.495
"Yes. And then he asked me
would I yes to say yes.

35:23.536 --> 35:25.094
"My mountain flower.

35:25.138 --> 35:27.436
"And first I put my arms
around him, yes...

35:27.473 --> 35:28.940
"and drew him down to me...

35:28.975 --> 35:31.603
"so he could feel my breasts
all perfumed, yes...

35:31.644 --> 35:33.942
"and his heart was going
like mad, and yes...

35:33.980 --> 35:35.971
"I said, yes, I will, yes."

35:36.015 --> 35:39.212
Yes! Yes!

35:44.390 --> 35:46.358
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

35:46.392 --> 35:47.859
I think Joyce
is pretty hot, too.

35:47.894 --> 35:49.794
And now that
I've got your attention...

35:49.829 --> 35:51.228
I'd like to run down
the reading list...

35:51.264 --> 35:54.324
for the semester.
See what else turns you on.

36:00.239 --> 36:02.002
What a woman.

36:02.041 --> 36:04.339
Dad, she is the teacher.

36:04.377 --> 36:05.867
I know. I like teachers.

36:05.912 --> 36:08.244
If you do something wrong,
they make you do it over again.

36:10.016 --> 36:12.507
Don't you think maybe
you should just take some notes?

36:12.552 --> 36:15.112
Yeah, yeah.

36:15.154 --> 36:19.056
I gave away all my pens.

36:19.091 --> 36:21.457
I'm sorry. I need this back.

36:21.494 --> 36:23.655
Here's a calendar for you.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.193
Oh, hiya.

36:28.234 --> 36:31.101
Hello, Mr. Melon.
You waiting for me?

36:31.137 --> 36:33.833
Yes, I was. Look,
I know I'm only a freshman...

36:33.873 --> 36:36.239
but what do you say
you and I have dinner tonight?

36:36.275 --> 36:39.540
We could talk about Joyce.
She's my favorite writer.

36:41.581 --> 36:44.106
You're not the usual freshman,
but I'm sorry, I can't.

36:44.150 --> 36:46.015
The thing is,
I'm sort of going with someone.

36:46.052 --> 36:48.213
Oh. Where you going?

36:48.254 --> 36:50.745
That's a good question.

36:50.790 --> 36:53.452
Actually, I'd like to join you,
but I have class tonight.

36:53.492 --> 36:56.757
- How about tomorrow night?
- I have class then, too.

36:56.796 --> 36:58.525
I'll tell you what, then.

36:58.564 --> 37:02.523
Why don't you call me
when you have no class?

37:02.568 --> 37:04.798
All right. Maybe I will.

37:10.676 --> 37:13.167
Hello, Philip.

37:13.212 --> 37:15.339
What did he want?

37:15.381 --> 37:18.282
Oh, what do all men want?

37:18.317 --> 37:20.251
He wants you to dress up
as Wonder Woman...

37:20.286 --> 37:23.813
tie him up with a golden lariat
and force him to tell the truth?

37:23.856 --> 37:26.256
No, just dinner, Philip.

37:26.292 --> 37:29.386
Are you jealous
of Thornton Melon?

37:29.428 --> 37:31.487
Certainly not.

37:31.530 --> 37:34.431
I've been doing a great deal
of thinking lately.

37:34.467 --> 37:37.732
I've been thinking about us.

37:37.770 --> 37:40.238
- And?
- And I think...

37:40.273 --> 37:43.640
we should start thinking
about forming a...

37:43.676 --> 37:45.405
well, um...

37:45.444 --> 37:46.570
A merger?

37:46.612 --> 37:48.978
A merger, exactly.
Exactly, a merger.

37:49.015 --> 37:51.575
A partnership.
Seriously, Diane...

37:51.617 --> 37:54.313
we're both intelligent,
well-educated adults.

37:54.353 --> 37:58.653
We should be together.
Incorporated, if you will.

37:58.691 --> 38:03.822
Look at the balance sheet.
We were made for one another.

38:03.863 --> 38:05.228
Oh, Philip, you darling.

38:05.264 --> 38:07.425
I don't want to be merged
or incorporated.

38:07.466 --> 38:11.334
I want to have fun
and be romanced and be loved.

38:13.205 --> 38:15.298
So let's not rush
into anything.

38:15.341 --> 38:18.174
Let's just start
by having fun, OK?

38:22.114 --> 38:24.412
Hey, how are you?
What's happening?

38:24.450 --> 38:25.644
Hi!

38:25.685 --> 38:27.585
A lot of people are talking
about your dad, man.

38:27.620 --> 38:29.554
What's happening?

38:29.588 --> 38:32.386
Hey, boys, how ya doin'?

38:32.425 --> 38:34.757
I wonder why.

38:36.295 --> 38:37.956
They have lockers.

38:37.997 --> 38:40.124
You could've changed here.

38:40.166 --> 38:42.157
I don't change
in front of guys.

38:42.201 --> 38:44.066
Next thing you know, you're
showering with the fellas.

38:44.103 --> 38:45.502
And the next thing you know...

38:45.538 --> 38:47.472
you're pinned to a sophomore
named Chip.

38:47.506 --> 38:49.064
Come on, let's go, huh?

38:49.108 --> 38:50.700
I'll see you later.

39:21.474 --> 39:23.874
That was pretty good.

39:23.909 --> 39:25.706
Next time, hold the pike
a little longer.

39:27.913 --> 39:30.006
Wait a minute.
I'll be right down.

39:54.006 --> 39:56.440
Not bad.

39:56.475 --> 39:58.966
All right, let's see one more.

40:00.179 --> 40:01.578
Like I showed you.

40:01.614 --> 40:02.774
All right.

40:08.747 --> 40:11.648
What's a guy your age
doing here with these kids?

40:11.684 --> 40:15.313
I'm lookin' for the fountain
of middle age.

40:15.354 --> 40:16.719
What's your story?

40:16.755 --> 40:19.246
I'm setting the new record for
the most consecutive losses...

40:19.291 --> 40:22.192
by a diving coach
in this conference.

40:22.228 --> 40:24.492
Hey, remember,
hold that pike longer.

40:24.530 --> 40:26.828
- That your kid?
- Yeah.

40:26.865 --> 40:29.095
Who coached him in high school?

40:29.134 --> 40:30.624
Yours truly.

40:30.669 --> 40:32.296
So, where did you learn
how to dive?

40:32.338 --> 40:35.774
Atlantic City. The Steel Pier.
I was in the water show.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.332
I used to open
for the diving horse.

40:37.376 --> 40:39.276
You're kiddin'.
I'm from Jersey.

40:39.311 --> 40:42.644
I practically spent
my entire life on that pier.

40:42.681 --> 40:45.241
There was a guy,
did the most amazing dive...

40:45.284 --> 40:46.945
called the Triple Lindy.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.681
Hardest dive
I ever saw in my life.

40:48.721 --> 40:51.417
- Who was that guy?
- Yours truly.

40:51.457 --> 40:52.924
You're kiddin'.

40:52.958 --> 40:54.721
I don't joke about dives.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.557
Especially that one.
It almost killed me.

40:56.595 --> 40:59.655
Boy, you were somethin' else.

40:59.698 --> 41:01.723
Hey, can your kid do that dive?

41:01.767 --> 41:04.827
Nah, nobody can.
It's too dangerous.

41:04.870 --> 41:07.839
You know, he tried out
for the team last semester.

41:07.873 --> 41:09.238
He didn't do that good.

41:09.275 --> 41:12.267
Not that good, huh? Watch this.

41:12.311 --> 41:15.075
Jason, do the two and a half!

41:29.728 --> 41:31.855
Not bad.

41:33.565 --> 41:34.862
My main Melon.
Come on, man...

41:34.900 --> 41:36.390
there's a pep rally
for the football team.

41:36.435 --> 41:38.426
- Let's go. We're there.
- Whoa, wait. What is this?

41:38.470 --> 41:41.735
Me and Standish and Redding
are doing the anti-pep rally...

41:41.774 --> 41:44.572
to point out that a violent
ground acquisition game...

41:44.610 --> 41:45.941
such as football is, in fact...

41:45.978 --> 41:47.775
a crypto-fascist metaphor
for nuclear war.

41:47.813 --> 41:49.906
It sounds like
a lot of laughs...

41:49.948 --> 41:51.279
but I'm supposed
to meet my dad and study.

41:51.317 --> 41:52.784
He's supposed
to be here already.

41:52.818 --> 41:54.786
OK, well...

41:54.820 --> 41:57.880
if you change your mind, pal,
you know where I'll be.

41:57.923 --> 42:01.586
If I change my mind,
I'll seek psychiatric help.

42:20.412 --> 42:21.606
Excuse me.

42:21.647 --> 42:25.105
What is the Oort system
and what does it tell us?

42:27.152 --> 42:29.120
What? I'm sorry.

42:29.154 --> 42:32.612
Astronomy, chapter two.

42:32.658 --> 42:34.853
Oh, Oort, Oort.

42:34.893 --> 42:37.418
Oort was this scientist,
and he figured out...

42:37.463 --> 42:41.797
that the smeared-out density
of matter can be no greater...

42:41.834 --> 42:45.031
than the solar mass
per cubic parsec.

42:45.070 --> 42:47.095
You look thrilled.
It's not my theory.

42:48.507 --> 42:51.476
Thanks, that helps a lot.

42:52.478 --> 42:54.673
Listen, I was
just wondering...

42:54.713 --> 42:56.305
would you do
my astronomy homework...

42:56.348 --> 42:57.872
for the rest of the semester?

43:00.586 --> 43:02.747
- Here you go.
- OK, right.

43:02.788 --> 43:04.187
Hi, Mr. Melon.

43:04.223 --> 43:06.783
Oh, you can call me Thornton.

43:06.825 --> 43:09.794
Say, how about joining me
and my friend over there?

43:09.828 --> 43:11.819
Your friend looks
a little strange.

43:11.864 --> 43:14.833
Who, Lou? Lou's an animal.
Why, in his family...

43:14.867 --> 43:19.236
he's only the second generation
that's standing up straight.

43:19.271 --> 43:20.761
What lovely girls.

43:20.806 --> 43:23.832
How would you like a life
of luxury and deceit?

43:23.876 --> 43:26.208
Come on, join us in a beer. OK?

43:26.245 --> 43:28.179
- Yeah, OK.
- OK.

43:37.856 --> 43:41.019
Girls, this is Lou.
Lou, these are girls.

43:44.129 --> 43:45.790
One, two.

43:45.831 --> 43:48.356
One, two.

43:55.107 --> 43:57.268
Shake it up, baby

43:59.077 --> 44:01.204
Twist and shout

44:02.881 --> 44:04.974
Come on, come on, come on, baby

44:06.985 --> 44:09.215
Come and work it on out

44:11.123 --> 44:13.557
Work it on out, honey

44:15.461 --> 44:18.589
Honey, come here. I need
2 more glasses for the girls...

44:18.630 --> 44:20.928
and also,
bring a pitcher of beer...

44:20.966 --> 44:22.991
every seven minutes
till somebody passes out.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.832
And then bring one
every ten minutes.

44:24.870 --> 44:26.269
You got it. Anyway...

44:26.305 --> 44:28.796
I thought we were gonna go...

44:28.841 --> 44:31.469
to the planetarium
and look at a lot of stars.

44:31.510 --> 44:34.206
I had no idea this was
gonna be astrophysics.

44:34.246 --> 44:37.010
It's not that hard.
You'll get it.

44:37.049 --> 44:40.416
It's not hard for you,
because you're smart.

44:40.452 --> 44:42.545
You're smart, too.

44:42.588 --> 44:45.022
Yeah, but you're, like,
"smart" smart.

44:45.057 --> 44:47.025
Do you study at the library
every night?

44:47.059 --> 44:48.617
No. I was gonna meet
my dad there...

44:48.660 --> 44:50.025
but he must be studying
at the dorm.

45:00.772 --> 45:02.797
Shake it up, baby

45:04.543 --> 45:06.340
Twist and shout

45:08.313 --> 45:10.508
Come on, come on, come on, baby

45:12.317 --> 45:14.683
Come on and work it on out

45:16.288 --> 45:18.188
You know you twist it,
little girl

45:18.223 --> 45:19.918
Lower, baby, lower.

45:19.958 --> 45:22.518
Hey, guys,
let me see some I.D.

45:22.561 --> 45:24.495
Not that low, baby.

45:24.530 --> 45:26.794
Come on and twist a little
closer now

45:26.832 --> 45:28.595
To the left, baby, to the left.

45:28.634 --> 45:30.226
And let me know you're mine

45:30.269 --> 45:31.497
That's the spot, baby.

45:31.537 --> 45:34.597
Hold it, hold it!
Oh, you are there!

45:34.640 --> 45:36.665
Shake it, baby

45:36.708 --> 45:40.337
Shake it, shake it, baby

45:40.379 --> 45:44.145
Come on and shake it,
shake it, shake it, baby

45:46.218 --> 45:47.981
- Shake it now
- Shake it

45:58.997 --> 46:00.396
OK, go ahead.

46:04.102 --> 46:06.332
Jason, what are you doing here?

46:06.371 --> 46:09.534
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

46:09.575 --> 46:11.805
We were supposed to study,
remember, in the library?

46:11.843 --> 46:13.743
The library.
I was supposed to be there.

46:13.779 --> 46:16.145
Hey, what's going on?

46:16.181 --> 46:18.172
Chas, check it out.

46:21.286 --> 46:23.413
Hey, Clark.

46:23.455 --> 46:25.389
Interesting little rally
you guys had tonight.

46:25.424 --> 46:28.291
Yeah, right. They got paint
all over my girlfriend.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.261
I'm gonna kill
them little pinheads.

46:30.295 --> 46:32.126
Yeah? Well, you came
to the right place...

46:32.164 --> 46:34.496
because guess who's here...
Derek Lutz.

46:40.606 --> 46:43.131
Hey, Lutz!

46:43.175 --> 46:44.733
You know who I am?

46:44.776 --> 46:46.641
Let me see...

46:46.678 --> 46:49.272
protruding
supra-orbital ridges...

46:49.314 --> 46:52.909
small cranium,
1,300 C.C. Brain...

46:52.951 --> 46:54.145
Neanderthal man.

46:54.186 --> 46:57.246
You... I want you
to call his mother.

46:57.289 --> 46:59.086
You tell her
he's never coming home.

46:59.124 --> 47:01.718
Whoa, hold it. You sure
you even got the right guy?

47:01.760 --> 47:03.523
Look how many people
got blue hair these days.

47:03.562 --> 47:05.029
Shut up, meathead.

47:05.063 --> 47:06.394
Take it easy, will ya?

47:06.431 --> 47:10.162
I mean, the war's over.
Get new parts for your head.

47:10.202 --> 47:12.898
Yeah? Want to make
something of it?

47:12.938 --> 47:16.237
Oh, no. I never get physical.
I just get upset...

47:16.274 --> 47:20.210
and when I get upset,
he gets physical.

47:27.619 --> 47:29.143
You got a problem?

47:29.187 --> 47:31.212
No, I haven't got a problem.

47:31.256 --> 47:33.622
Now you do.

47:44.202 --> 47:45.601
Get him!

47:57.315 --> 47:58.509
Lou, where you been?

47:58.550 --> 48:00.415
I'm getting my ass kicked
all over the place!

48:26.278 --> 48:29.042
- Well, you look terrible.
- No, I'm all right.

48:29.081 --> 48:32.847
It's Lou I'm worried about.
He may lose his trigger finger.

48:32.884 --> 48:34.146
It serves you guys right.

48:34.186 --> 48:36.245
Why did you have to take on
the whole football team?

48:36.288 --> 48:37.448
They're not that tough.

48:37.489 --> 48:39.821
The football team
at my high school was tough.

48:39.858 --> 48:41.485
After they sacked
the quarterback...

48:41.526 --> 48:43.391
they went after his family.

48:45.764 --> 48:47.959
This morning we're going to look
at "The Great Gatsby"...

48:47.999 --> 48:50.160
by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

48:50.202 --> 48:53.603
Mr. Melon, how would you
characterize "The Great Gatsby?"

48:53.638 --> 48:55.572
Who, him?

48:55.607 --> 48:57.040
No, you.

48:57.075 --> 48:58.474
Me.

48:58.510 --> 49:01.570
Well, "The Great Gatsby,"
he was...

49:01.613 --> 49:03.808
great.

49:06.952 --> 49:08.544
See me after class, Mr. Melon.

49:12.557 --> 49:14.422
I mean, please,
try to understand.

49:14.459 --> 49:16.017
I don't have
the background for this.

49:16.061 --> 49:17.323
The high school I went to...

49:17.362 --> 49:19.023
they asked a kid to prove
the law of gravity.

49:19.064 --> 49:21.362
He threw the teacher
out the window.

49:21.399 --> 49:26.598
I know what I need.
I need a tutor.

49:26.638 --> 49:29.106
What do you say? Come on.

49:29.141 --> 49:31.701
You got some spare time.

49:31.743 --> 49:33.074
All right, Mr. Melon.

49:33.111 --> 49:34.874
I have some spare time
this evening.

49:34.913 --> 49:37.074
Why don't you come around
about 7:00?

49:37.115 --> 49:39.709
- Great.
- I'll give you my address.

49:40.886 --> 49:43.252
- Thanks.
- Please be on time.

49:43.288 --> 49:45.722
I'll be on time.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.460
What penmanship.

49:50.896 --> 49:54.593
"Everywhere the ceremony
of innocence is drowned;

49:54.633 --> 49:56.294
"The best
lack all conviction...

49:56.334 --> 49:59.599
"while the worst are full
of passionate intensity."

49:59.638 --> 50:01.230
There's a lot
of other stuff here.

50:01.273 --> 50:05.471
Yeats goes on and on...
and here's the finish.

50:05.510 --> 50:08.673
"What rough beast,
its hour come round at last...

50:08.713 --> 50:11.614
"slouches towards Bethlehem
to be born?"

50:11.650 --> 50:13.277
What does that
make you think of?

50:13.318 --> 50:16.310
Rough beast. My ex-wife.

50:16.354 --> 50:17.685
Well, that's
one interpretation.

50:17.722 --> 50:19.713
Not the right one,
but it's a start.

50:19.758 --> 50:22.090
Surely a man of your age
and experience...

50:22.127 --> 50:23.788
must have read some
of the things on my list.

50:23.829 --> 50:26.457
- What about "Macbeth"?
- I saw the movie.

50:26.498 --> 50:29.592
Orson Welles.
Great actor, big actor.

50:29.634 --> 50:32.102
He was a Tall and Fat
customer for years.

50:32.137 --> 50:33.399
How about
"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"?

50:33.438 --> 50:35.372
I saw the movie. Burl lves.

50:35.407 --> 50:38.934
Great actor, extra stout.
He was a customer, too.

50:38.977 --> 50:41.639
- "Streetcar Named Desire."
- Great movie. Marlon Brando.

50:41.680 --> 50:45.241
He wasn't that big then,
but he ballooned up nicely.

50:45.283 --> 50:47.945
I'd say pound for pound,
our finest American actor.

50:47.986 --> 50:49.954
Don't you ever read?

50:49.988 --> 50:53.549
Who has time? I see the movie.
I'm in and out in two hours.

50:53.592 --> 50:54.991
Oh, Thornton, don't you see?

50:55.026 --> 50:56.823
The reason you want
to read these works...

50:56.862 --> 50:58.796
is so you can experience them
for yourself...

50:58.830 --> 51:01.628
so you can share the thoughts
and feelings of the writer...

51:01.666 --> 51:04.157
without the interference
of your actor and director...

51:04.202 --> 51:06.033
and professor's point of view
getting in the way...

51:06.071 --> 51:08.869
to truly share
and understand...

51:08.907 --> 51:10.807
the common feelings
of all mankind...

51:10.842 --> 51:13.140
the feelings of being alive.

51:14.746 --> 51:16.805
That was beautiful.

51:16.848 --> 51:18.816
I understand
what you're saying, too.

51:18.850 --> 51:20.647
I'm glad.
That makes me feel good.

51:20.685 --> 51:22.983
I got an idea.

51:23.021 --> 51:26.184
Let's keep talking over dinner.

51:26.224 --> 51:28.317
I'm supposed to meet
someone for dinner.

51:29.527 --> 51:31.995
I could cancel,
though, I guess.

51:32.030 --> 51:33.361
We are working, after all.

51:33.398 --> 51:35.229
You can't work
on an empty stomach.

51:35.267 --> 51:38.259
You can't concentrate
when you're hungry.

51:38.303 --> 51:40.271
Oh, I don't know.
I really shouldn't.

51:40.305 --> 51:43.172
- I have so many things to do.
- Oh, come on. I'll help you.

51:43.208 --> 51:45.233
I'll take out the garbage.
I'll do the dishes.

51:45.277 --> 51:47.108
I'll do your nails.
I'll do your hair.

51:47.145 --> 51:48.908
You have no idea
what I want to do.

51:48.947 --> 51:50.915
- I'll call him.
- I'll dial it!

51:50.949 --> 51:53.611
I'll just get the light.

51:53.652 --> 51:56.587
I think I'm attracted
to teachers.

51:56.621 --> 51:59.181
I took out an English teacher.
That didn't work out at all.

51:59.224 --> 52:01.749
I sent her a love letter.
She corrected it.

52:04.195 --> 52:06.322
Oh, great. Company.

52:10.568 --> 52:13.696
- Those two ought to get a room.
- Really.

52:13.738 --> 52:15.205
Actually,
I was married twice.

52:15.240 --> 52:18.903
My first wife, Jason's mother,
I really loved her.

52:18.944 --> 52:21.276
We had a good thing going,
you know?

52:21.313 --> 52:23.508
She passed away
about ten years ago.

52:23.548 --> 52:26.176
After that, I screwed around
for a few years.

52:26.217 --> 52:29.516
Then I really went nuts...
I married Vanessa.

52:29.554 --> 52:31.579
I was just lonely, I guess.

52:31.623 --> 52:32.885
Is that over now?

52:32.924 --> 52:34.619
We were doomed from the start.

52:34.659 --> 52:36.627
I'm an earth sign,
she's a water sign.

52:36.661 --> 52:37.889
Together, we made mud.

52:37.929 --> 52:41.421
I picked a beauty.
And she played around, too.

52:41.466 --> 52:44.128
When she said, "I do,"
I should have said, "With who?"

52:44.169 --> 52:46.569
So, are you
giving up on women?

52:46.604 --> 52:48.902
I don't know.
I can't figure women out.

52:48.940 --> 52:50.237
Today, they're independent.

52:50.275 --> 52:52.140
They only think
about themselves.

52:52.177 --> 52:55.374
During sex, Vanessa used
to scream out her own name.

52:57.449 --> 52:58.916
I think it's the men
who are different.

52:58.950 --> 53:00.212
Ever since
the women's movement...

53:00.251 --> 53:01.843
most of the men I meet
go out of their way...

53:01.886 --> 53:03.615
to show you
how sensitive they are.

53:03.655 --> 53:07.648
Before they were too macho,
and now they're too soft.

53:07.692 --> 53:09.660
You all want us to know
you can cry.

53:09.694 --> 53:12.720
No, with women,
I never cry. Never.

53:12.764 --> 53:14.254
I beg.

53:18.169 --> 53:20.137
If we finish
this bottle of wine...

53:20.171 --> 53:22.469
you won't have to beg.

53:39.457 --> 53:40.617
Diane!

53:42.527 --> 53:43.994
Oh, Philip.

53:44.029 --> 53:45.963
We were supposed
to go to dinner.

53:45.997 --> 53:47.760
I just had dinner!

53:47.799 --> 53:49.289
I don't believe this.

53:49.334 --> 53:53.464
Maybe it's a dream.
Good night, Philip.

53:54.539 --> 53:56.336
You do a good job.

53:56.374 --> 53:59.343
What do you charge
for big cars?

54:10.221 --> 54:13.520
I had a lot of fun, Thornton.

54:13.558 --> 54:16.686
Me, too.
And thanks for the lesson.

54:16.728 --> 54:18.195
I learned a lot.

54:18.229 --> 54:20.857
You're welcome. I did, too.

54:22.734 --> 54:23.962
Well...

54:25.103 --> 54:28.561
Well, I guess
this is good night.

54:28.606 --> 54:29.937
Yeah.

54:31.943 --> 54:34.070
A very good night.

54:40.852 --> 54:42.183
Beautiful.

54:44.089 --> 54:45.386
Oh, that's it.

54:45.423 --> 54:47.789
That's the spot.
Just keep doing that.

54:47.826 --> 54:50.795
Oh, don't lose it.

54:50.829 --> 54:53.024
Oh, Lou, you're great.

54:53.064 --> 54:55.965
The leg is better.
You got the cramp out.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.401
You're a wreck.
You gotta start working out.

54:59.437 --> 55:01.200
And you know what else?

55:01.239 --> 55:04.106
You have got midterms
coming up.

55:04.142 --> 55:06.770
You haven't studied five minutes
since you got here.

55:06.811 --> 55:07.971
You're always so neat.

55:08.012 --> 55:09.912
You're just like
your Uncle Vito.

55:09.948 --> 55:12.542
We were kids,
his room was always in order.

55:12.584 --> 55:13.744
His towels lined up neatly...

55:13.785 --> 55:15.946
combs, brushes, hair lotions
all in the right place.

55:15.987 --> 55:17.955
What did it mean?
What is he today?

55:17.989 --> 55:19.547
He's an attendant
in the men's room.

55:19.591 --> 55:21.991
Hey, he's my idol.

55:22.026 --> 55:27.259
But I'm not gonna be
folding towels anymore...

55:27.298 --> 55:30.461
'cause I just made...
ta da... the diving team.

55:30.502 --> 55:33.130
That's great!

55:33.171 --> 55:34.331
I'm takin' you out.

55:34.372 --> 55:36.067
We'll celebrate.
We're havin' a party!

55:36.107 --> 55:38.701
Oh, no, Dad, that's really nice,
but I'm in training now.

55:38.743 --> 55:41.211
We got a big meet coming up
against Northern.

55:41.246 --> 55:43.305
We'll have a party
after the meet.

55:43.348 --> 55:47.284
Dad, why don't you join me
on a little reality break, OK?

55:47.318 --> 55:49.684
Just 'cause you're in love
with Dr. Turner...

55:49.721 --> 55:52.485
does not mean you're
gonna pass her course.

55:52.524 --> 55:55.118
You got a major paper
coming up on Kurt Vonnegut.

55:55.160 --> 55:56.957
You haven't even read
any of the books.

55:56.995 --> 55:58.656
I tried.

55:58.696 --> 56:01.859
I don't understand
a word of it.

56:02.867 --> 56:05.859
So, how you gonna
write the paper, then?

56:09.874 --> 56:13.139
Hi, I'm Kurt Vonnegut.
I'm looking for Thornton Melon.

56:15.847 --> 56:18.475
Want to come in? Dad?

56:21.519 --> 56:24.317
I don't want to hear
one more word out of you...

56:24.355 --> 56:26.323
or it's back to the tree.

56:26.357 --> 56:28.689
Come in.

56:28.726 --> 56:31.718
Excuse me. Dr. Barazini?

56:31.763 --> 56:33.128
I'm Thornton Melon.

56:33.164 --> 56:36.691
Oh, yes, Thornton Melon.
I know you.

56:36.734 --> 56:40.329
You delivered the paper
on isomagnetic brain waves...

56:40.371 --> 56:41.929
in Montreal last year.

56:41.973 --> 56:44.533
No, I sold you your pants.

56:44.576 --> 56:46.635
Oh, of course.
Good to see you.

56:46.678 --> 56:48.202
What are you doing here?

56:48.246 --> 56:50.612
I'm supposed to report here
for my lab project.

56:50.648 --> 56:53.481
Oh, good. I'm trying to teach
these here apes...

56:53.518 --> 56:55.349
how to read and write.

56:55.386 --> 56:58.184
You ought to teach them
how to go to the bathroom.

56:58.223 --> 57:00.282
You'll get used to that.

57:00.325 --> 57:05.092
Now, all you have to do
is put a new tape...

57:05.129 --> 57:08.758
in the tape machine every hour
and observe the animals.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.961
I'll be back in a few hours
to check on you.

57:11.002 --> 57:13.562
- OK, fine.
- All righty.

57:15.406 --> 57:18.739
You don't need this.
I'll find you an organ grinder.

57:28.686 --> 57:30.847
Hiya, Marge?
A few things.

57:30.888 --> 57:33.550
I need you and the gang to get
down here as fast as you can.

57:33.591 --> 57:35.218
And I have to talk to Peterson,
the accountant.

57:35.260 --> 57:36.625
I'm gonna need him, too.

57:36.661 --> 57:39.960
Oh, thanks.
And, Marge, I need...

57:42.900 --> 57:45.198
See if you can get somebody
at the Rand Corporation...

57:45.236 --> 57:48.103
or the Brookings Institute to
come down here for about a week.

57:50.675 --> 57:51.869
What?

57:53.745 --> 57:56.737
And Russell hits him
with a powerful front body slam!

58:01.719 --> 58:03.016
No problem.

58:03.054 --> 58:05.454
They're takin' a break,
that's all.

58:06.958 --> 58:11.190
In 1971, the United States
accumulated deficits...

58:11.229 --> 58:14.164
greater than the supply
of gold the country held.

58:14.198 --> 58:16.894
In that year, Richard Nixon...

58:16.934 --> 58:19.869
took the United States
off the gold standard.

58:19.904 --> 58:22.236
In doing so, he disrupted...

58:24.942 --> 58:27.877
the entire international
monetary system.

58:27.912 --> 58:30.642
What is that clicking noise?

58:35.753 --> 58:37.812
Are you a student
in this class?

58:39.657 --> 58:41.056
No.

58:41.092 --> 58:43.617
Who are you?

58:43.661 --> 58:46.926
I'm Marge Sweetwater...

58:46.964 --> 58:49.262
Mr. Thornton Melon's
private secretary.

58:56.307 --> 58:59.299
What are you doing here?

58:59.344 --> 59:02.745
I'm taking notes for Mr. Melon.

59:06.484 --> 59:10.716
He told you to write down
everything I say?

59:10.755 --> 59:13.485
Yes, he did.

59:13.524 --> 59:14.957
Good.

59:17.395 --> 59:19.693
Take this down.

59:22.433 --> 59:25.800
Mr. Melon,
no matter what you do...

59:27.372 --> 59:30.239
no matter what stunts
you pull...

59:30.274 --> 59:33.402
no matter how hard you try...

59:33.444 --> 59:37.904
you will never, ever
pass this course.

59:40.852 --> 59:43.320
Make sure he gets that.

59:46.391 --> 59:48.359
Yes, sir.

59:48.393 --> 59:49.553
I'll tell you what.

59:49.594 --> 59:51.824
It's for Barbay.
Make it an "A."

59:51.863 --> 59:54.024
Where's the lab report
on psychology?

59:54.065 --> 59:55.396
Here.

59:57.402 --> 01:00:00.565
It's too light.
It feels like a "C."

01:00:00.605 --> 01:00:03.870
Bulk it up and add a few
multicolored graphs.

01:00:03.908 --> 01:00:06.536
- Yo, Dad.
- Jason, hold it, will ya?

01:00:06.577 --> 01:00:09.273
Listen, everybody.
Let's see "As" across the board.

01:00:09.313 --> 01:00:10.473
I'll tell you what...

01:00:10.515 --> 01:00:12.915
a ten percent bonus
for every grade over "B."

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:17.512
And an A+ gets you a free trip
to Hawaii... off-season.

01:00:19.056 --> 01:00:22.890
- Dad, what's going on here?
- I'm doing my homework.

01:00:22.927 --> 01:00:25.122
No, they're doing
your homework.

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:28.098
A good executive knows how
to delegate authority.

01:00:28.132 --> 01:00:30.726
I took care of you, too.

01:00:30.768 --> 01:00:34.534
- And what's this?
- Your astronomy report.

01:00:34.572 --> 01:00:37.063
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

01:00:37.108 --> 01:00:39.474
I want to write that paper.
I'm gonna write that paper.

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:42.001
That's why I'm taking astronomy,
to learn something!

01:00:42.046 --> 01:00:44.014
You're never gonna learn
a goddamn thing...

01:00:44.048 --> 01:00:46.073
if you got people
doing your work for you!

01:00:46.117 --> 01:00:48.017
Oh, never mind.

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:54.050
Kids... they always do things
the hard way.

01:00:54.091 --> 01:00:57.959
Ladies and gentlemen,
the visiting team...

01:00:57.995 --> 01:01:01.294
the Northern University
Wildcats!

01:01:02.767 --> 01:01:07.261
And your Grand Lakes
University Hooters!

01:01:07.305 --> 01:01:10.069
- Hey, there's your boy!
- Jason!

01:01:14.145 --> 01:01:17.273
While the teams are warming up,
we'd like to remind you...

01:01:17.315 --> 01:01:19.374
that all proceeds
from the refreshment stands...

01:01:19.417 --> 01:01:21.112
go to your student government.

01:01:21.152 --> 01:01:24.121
Hey, Valerie. How you doin'?

01:01:24.155 --> 01:01:26.248
Glad you could come. Listen.

01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:29.225
My dad is having a party
tonight at the dorm...

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.161
and it should be pretty great.
His parties usually are.

01:01:32.196 --> 01:01:36.895
I'd love to come,
except for I have a date.

01:01:36.934 --> 01:01:40.392
Oh. Well, hey, bring him along.

01:01:40.438 --> 01:01:42.929
It's OK.
You just both come by.

01:01:42.974 --> 01:01:44.839
I'll really try.

01:01:44.876 --> 01:01:46.844
Good. I hope
I'll see you there.

01:01:46.878 --> 01:01:49.972
It sounds like fun. I wish
my dad were more like yours.

01:02:00.658 --> 01:02:03.286
Hey, Chas.

01:02:03.327 --> 01:02:05.090
Good luck, buddy.
Let's get them.

01:02:05.129 --> 01:02:08.724
Yeah. Thanks, Melon.
I'd wish you luck, too...

01:02:08.766 --> 01:02:10.791
but I guess a guy like you
doesn't need luck.

01:02:11.802 --> 01:02:13.793
What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:13.838 --> 01:02:15.897
With your old man behind you...

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.465
I figured since he bought
your way onto the team...

01:02:18.509 --> 01:02:20.977
he probably bought off
the judges, too.

01:02:25.049 --> 01:02:27.677
Oh, there's Thornton.

01:02:27.718 --> 01:02:29.811
Diane!

01:02:31.422 --> 01:02:34.880
I can't imagine what you can
possibly see in that man.

01:02:34.926 --> 01:02:38.157
Philip, would you excuse me
for a minute?

01:02:42.033 --> 01:02:44.058
Yes, yes.

01:02:44.101 --> 01:02:46.126
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks.

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.967
Where you been?
I called you a hundred times.

01:02:48.005 --> 01:02:49.973
I made four dates
with your answering machine.

01:02:50.007 --> 01:02:51.998
I'm sorry I missed you.
Things have been so hectic.

01:02:52.043 --> 01:02:54.876
I've been reading midterm papers
and grading exams.

01:02:54.912 --> 01:02:56.140
Did you read mine yet?

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.045
Not yet,
but I'm looking forward to it.

01:02:58.082 --> 01:02:59.947
I'm throwing a party
in our room tonight...

01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:01.474
and you better be there.

01:03:01.519 --> 01:03:04.511
I'm sorry. I have a date
with Philip tonight.

01:03:04.555 --> 01:03:08.218
Bring him along.
We may run out of ice.

01:03:10.928 --> 01:03:15.024
First diver
for Grand Lakes University...

01:03:15.066 --> 01:03:17.330
Chas Osbourne.

01:03:40.491 --> 01:03:44.120
Hey, Coach! How are ya?
How you doin', huh?

01:03:48.766 --> 01:03:53.999
Next diver for Grand Lakes...
Jason Melon.

01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:56.336
Melon.

01:04:41.585 --> 01:04:42.677
What's going on?

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.449
This is always
the best party of the year.

01:04:44.488 --> 01:04:47.116
I don't know.
Some big event at the dorms.

01:04:47.158 --> 01:04:50.719
- We're thinkin' of going over.
- To Melon's? Are you nuts?

01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:52.228
Why don't we go?

01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:54.094
Valerie, please.
It'll be horrible.

01:04:54.131 --> 01:04:56.827
Jason said it would be great.
It might be fun.

01:04:56.867 --> 01:05:00.166
Jason's a twerp. We could have
won if it weren't for him.

01:05:00.204 --> 01:05:02.866
Haven't you ever messed up?

01:05:02.907 --> 01:05:04.101
No.

01:05:09.113 --> 01:05:13.743
I'm all dressed up
with nowhere to go

01:05:13.784 --> 01:05:15.513
Hey, baby!

01:05:15.553 --> 01:05:18.784
Walking with a dead man
over my shoulder

01:05:21.559 --> 01:05:24.357
I'm all dressed up
with nowhere to go

01:05:26.697 --> 01:05:28.961
I love three girls at once.

01:05:28.999 --> 01:05:32.059
If I fall asleep,
they have each other to talk to.

01:05:39.744 --> 01:05:42.042
Nice look.
What are you going for?

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:44.445
The heavy, disassociated
artist thing...

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:48.248
or the "I'm going blind" thing?

01:05:48.285 --> 01:05:52.221
Oh, It's the deaf thing.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

01:05:52.256 --> 01:05:54.656
Oh, do me!

01:05:54.692 --> 01:05:56.353
Derek! Get up, will ya?

01:05:56.393 --> 01:05:59.556
You look like the poster boy
for birth control.

01:06:03.267 --> 01:06:05.735
Jason, it's a party.
What's your story?

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:07.738
What's the matter?
The swim meet?

01:06:07.772 --> 01:06:11.731
Forget about it. It's history.

01:06:11.776 --> 01:06:14.142
Come on, will ya? Snap into it!

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:16.510
You're right, Dad.
It doesn't matter, Dad!

01:06:16.547 --> 01:06:18.640
Right, Dad?
Come on, party, right?

01:06:26.123 --> 01:06:28.318
Hey, buddy!

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:30.691
Everybody, make some noise,
have some fun!

01:06:37.067 --> 01:06:38.864
What's that noise?

01:06:38.903 --> 01:06:40.962
It's a party, Philip.
Midterms, remember?

01:06:41.005 --> 01:06:43.496
They're just blowing off steam.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:44.769
You there.

01:06:47.144 --> 01:06:48.441
What's going on here?

01:06:48.479 --> 01:06:52.677
The Melon man is throwing
the greatest party of all time!

01:06:52.716 --> 01:06:55.810
The whole world is there.
It's the best thing...

01:06:55.853 --> 01:06:58.151
that's ever happened to me
in my whole life!

01:06:58.189 --> 01:07:00.487
Oh, God.

01:07:04.862 --> 01:07:06.921
Look at that!

01:07:06.964 --> 01:07:08.124
Listen to that racket.

01:07:08.165 --> 01:07:10.429
This is disgraceful.
I should phone security.

01:07:10.467 --> 01:07:12.128
Oh, Philip.

01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:20.238
Good. Apparently I'm not
the only one around here...

01:07:20.277 --> 01:07:21.835
with a sense of decency.

01:07:28.118 --> 01:07:29.915
Yeah. Cool!

01:07:33.757 --> 01:07:36.191
Did you see...
where are you going?

01:07:36.227 --> 01:07:38.195
Intellectual curiosity, Philip.

01:07:38.229 --> 01:07:39.594
Sounds fun in there.
Come with me.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:42.531
- Oh, please!
- Oh, Philip!

01:07:46.403 --> 01:07:48.963
It's a dead man's party

01:07:49.006 --> 01:07:51.167
Who could ask for more

01:07:52.243 --> 01:07:54.177
Everybody's coming

01:07:54.211 --> 01:07:57.112
Leave your body
at the door

01:07:57.147 --> 01:08:00.947
Leave your body and soul
at the door

01:08:01.952 --> 01:08:04.477
Don't run away

01:08:04.521 --> 01:08:07.285
It's only me

01:08:14.198 --> 01:08:16.359
Don't run away

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:19.698
It's only me, only me

01:08:19.737 --> 01:08:23.002
Don't be afraid

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.500
Of what you can't see

01:08:27.544 --> 01:08:29.705
Say when.

01:08:29.747 --> 01:08:32.341
Right after this drink.

01:08:32.383 --> 01:08:34.749
Hey, what's a bath
without Bubbles?

01:08:34.785 --> 01:08:37.447
Hey, Bubbles,
come over here, will ya?

01:08:39.756 --> 01:08:42.350
Well!

01:08:42.393 --> 01:08:44.622
- Hi there.
- Hi!

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.823
- What's your favorite subject?
- Poetry.

01:08:46.863 --> 01:08:50.857
Really? Maybe you can help me
straighten out my Longfellow.

01:08:54.604 --> 01:08:56.663
Excuse me.
Have you seen Thornton Melon?

01:08:56.707 --> 01:08:58.470
I think he's in there.

01:08:58.509 --> 01:08:59.669
Thanks.

01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:09.017
Excuse me.
Has anyone seen Thornton Melon?

01:09:10.187 --> 01:09:12.781
That's what I call
marine biology.

01:09:12.823 --> 01:09:14.221
Diane!

01:09:15.926 --> 01:09:18.087
Say hello to my nieces.

01:09:19.662 --> 01:09:21.062
Wait a minute!

01:09:25.736 --> 01:09:30.173
Jason? There you are.
I was looking all over for you.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:34.268
Jason, are you OK?
I'm sorry about the swim meet.

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:37.508
Shit. Swim meet.

01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:40.278
Jesus, you think I care
about the swim meet?

01:09:40.317 --> 01:09:42.182
I mean, it's just
a stupid college game.

01:09:42.219 --> 01:09:43.550
It's just bullshit.

01:09:43.587 --> 01:09:45.520
Why are you acting like this?

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:47.546
I know you don't think
like that.

01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:49.957
Oh, you do?

01:09:49.993 --> 01:09:53.054
Grow up, Valerie.
You think this is real?

01:09:53.096 --> 01:09:56.191
This isn't real.
College is a dream world.

01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:57.962
This is something you do
to pass the time...

01:09:58.002 --> 01:10:00.527
till you go out in the real
world and start buying people.

01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:03.233
Let's go for a walk
and talk this out.

01:10:03.273 --> 01:10:05.366
There you are.

01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:07.400
Can we go? I'm bored.

01:10:07.444 --> 01:10:08.672
Oh, Christ, Osbourne...

01:10:08.712 --> 01:10:10.907
will you just get
your ass outta here?

01:10:10.948 --> 01:10:12.973
What a surprise.
Another shit-faced Melon.

01:10:13.017 --> 01:10:15.178
Do I gotta knock your teeth
down your throat?

01:10:15.219 --> 01:10:18.120
Easy. Your father isn't here
to back you up this time.

01:10:20.124 --> 01:10:21.591
Don't!

01:10:25.963 --> 01:10:27.260
Are you OK?

01:10:27.297 --> 01:10:30.994
Jason! I was lookin' for ya.

01:10:31.035 --> 01:10:34.004
Hey, come here. Where ya goin'?

01:10:34.038 --> 01:10:36.506
Where am I going?

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.236
I'm leaving school, Dad.
One of us has gotta go.

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:41.471
You're having such a great time.
I'm getting out.

01:10:41.512 --> 01:10:42.979
Why? I don't get it.

01:10:43.013 --> 01:10:44.708
Because you didn't win
the diving meet?

01:10:44.748 --> 01:10:46.511
No, not because I didn't win!

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:48.245
Because I shouldn't
even have been there.

01:10:48.285 --> 01:10:49.775
Chas told me
you bribed the coach...

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.287
to put me on the team.
Real good!

01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:54.552
What? And you believed him.
I never lied to you in my life.

01:10:54.591 --> 01:10:55.853
I didn't bribe the coach.

01:10:55.893 --> 01:10:57.622
You were on the team
because you deserve it.

01:10:57.661 --> 01:10:59.390
You made it on your own.

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:01.227
Dad, you don't get it.

01:11:01.265 --> 01:11:02.823
Everything I have
is because of you...

01:11:02.866 --> 01:11:04.026
and because of you...

01:11:04.068 --> 01:11:07.765
I get my astronomy homework
done for me by NASA.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:10.831
I just want the best for you.
That's all I ever wanted.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.071
I did it all for you.

01:11:16.547 --> 01:11:19.072
I know, but you don't know
when to quit.

01:11:19.116 --> 01:11:22.984
I know you came here to help me,
and I really appreciate it...

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.818
and it's really sweet,
and it's really not working.

01:11:25.856 --> 01:11:27.721
Can't you let me just do
something for myself?

01:11:27.758 --> 01:11:29.851
I just want to see you happy.

01:11:29.893 --> 01:11:32.521
Well, take a good look!

01:11:32.563 --> 01:11:36.192
'Cause I was a lot happier
when I was miserable.

01:11:47.811 --> 01:11:49.574
I enjoyed reading that, Susan.

01:11:49.613 --> 01:11:50.910
It's a nice improvement.
Thank you.

01:11:50.948 --> 01:11:53.473
Diane, why'd you fail me?

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:56.008
I didn't, Thornton.
You failed me.

01:11:56.053 --> 01:11:59.511
- Is it because of last night?
- No. I can accept the fact...

01:11:59.556 --> 01:12:01.524
that you're completely
regressed emotionally...

01:12:01.558 --> 01:12:04.527
but you won't pass my course by
turning in someone else's work.

01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:07.291
What do you think,
someone else wrote this?

01:12:07.331 --> 01:12:09.765
All I know is that you didn't.
That's what disappoints me.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.859
Whoever did write it...

01:12:11.902 --> 01:12:14.530
doesn't know the first thing
about Kurt Vonnegut.

01:12:14.571 --> 01:12:15.833
And another thing, Vonnegut.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:18.273
I'm going to stop payment
on the check.

01:12:18.308 --> 01:12:20.776
What's that? Fuck me?

01:12:20.811 --> 01:12:24.440
Kurt, do you read lips?
Fuck you!

01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:26.472
Next time
I'll call Robert Ludlum.

01:12:30.454 --> 01:12:32.388
Derek, have you seen Jason?

01:12:32.422 --> 01:12:35.391
I think he's on
a three-state killing spree.

01:12:35.425 --> 01:12:37.222
Here's some more
potentially bad news.

01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:40.128
Dean Martin wants to see you
in his office right away.

01:12:40.164 --> 01:12:41.495
Dean Martin.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.960
And she said, "Let's do it.
The room's already paid for."

01:12:52.109 --> 01:12:55.772
Oh, golly.
I'm afraid we have...

01:12:55.812 --> 01:12:59.680
a potentially unpleasant
situation on our hands here.

01:12:59.716 --> 01:13:02.844
Phil, would you repeat
to Mr. Melon...

01:13:02.886 --> 01:13:05.980
the allegations
that you've made to me?

01:13:06.023 --> 01:13:08.992
It's clear the work you've
handed in is not your own.

01:13:09.026 --> 01:13:11.426
I'm accusing you
of academic fraud.

01:13:11.461 --> 01:13:15.192
Fraud is such an ugly word...

01:13:15.232 --> 01:13:18.167
considering
the financial generosity...

01:13:18.202 --> 01:13:21.194
that Mr. Melon has shown
towards our fine university.

01:13:21.238 --> 01:13:23.934
I think Mr. Melon
should be expelled.

01:13:25.576 --> 01:13:28.739
What are you going
to do about it?

01:13:30.214 --> 01:13:32.341
Well, Thornton...

01:13:32.382 --> 01:13:35.010
I'm only going
to ask you this one time.

01:13:35.052 --> 01:13:38.613
Is the work that
you turned in your own?

01:13:42.426 --> 01:13:44.951
I can't lie to you,
Dean Martin.

01:13:47.531 --> 01:13:49.021
Yes, it is.

01:13:49.066 --> 01:13:51.660
I'm satisfied.

01:13:51.702 --> 01:13:53.863
- Phil?
- I'm outraged.

01:13:53.904 --> 01:13:56.964
Gee whiz, Phil!
I just asked the man...

01:13:57.007 --> 01:13:59.134
if the work was his,
and he said yes.

01:13:59.176 --> 01:14:01.804
What do you want me to do,
torture him?

01:14:03.247 --> 01:14:06.580
I suggest a comprehensive
oral examination...

01:14:06.617 --> 01:14:09.017
conducted by all of
Mr. Melon's professors.

01:14:09.052 --> 01:14:10.519
Oral examination?

01:14:10.554 --> 01:14:14.081
Yes. If you've done the work
you say you have...

01:14:14.124 --> 01:14:17.423
there should be no problem,
should there?

01:14:19.296 --> 01:14:21.662
Hey, Jase.

01:14:21.698 --> 01:14:24.258
Hey, Lou. How you doin'?

01:14:24.301 --> 01:14:26.166
Come here.
I want to tell you something.

01:14:26.203 --> 01:14:27.329
What?

01:14:27.371 --> 01:14:29.601
You were pretty hard
on your father last night.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.040
I know, but the guy
doesn't understand.

01:14:32.075 --> 01:14:34.771
I know your pop thirty years.
He understands.

01:14:34.811 --> 01:14:37.177
He's a nice guy,
and he's tough.

01:14:37.214 --> 01:14:41.275
Like me.
I'm nice, and I'm tough.

01:14:41.318 --> 01:14:43.843
I'll give you an idea
what I mean.

01:14:43.887 --> 01:14:46.515
My two boys... I put one
through college...

01:14:46.556 --> 01:14:48.387
and the other
I put through a wall.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.851
Your papa loves you.

01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:56.691
He's lookin' out for ya.
Look out for him.

01:15:22.225 --> 01:15:23.522
What's goin' on?

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.324
I'm leavin'. I'm sorry, Jason.

01:15:26.363 --> 01:15:29.594
This college thing
was a big mistake.

01:15:29.633 --> 01:15:32.466
- So you're gonna give up?
- I can't win.

01:15:32.502 --> 01:15:35.130
They want me to take oral exams
in all my subjects.

01:15:35.172 --> 01:15:37.640
If I don't take them,
they'll kick me out.

01:15:37.674 --> 01:15:40.234
And if I take 'em,
who knows where they'll kick me.

01:15:43.013 --> 01:15:45.379
Hey, Dad, you remember
what you told me...

01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:47.542
when I told you
I wanted to quit?

01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:50.985
You told me that a man
without an education is nothing.

01:15:51.021 --> 01:15:52.113
I can't do it.

01:15:52.155 --> 01:15:53.645
You can do anything
you want to do.

01:15:53.690 --> 01:15:56.818
You can do anything
you want in life.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.828
Remember, you're a Melon.

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:05.631
Don't quit. I'll help you.

01:17:32.122 --> 01:17:34.386
Before we begin...

01:17:34.424 --> 01:17:37.916
I would just like to thank
each and every professor here...

01:17:37.961 --> 01:17:42.898
for taking time out of
his/her extremely busy schedule.

01:17:42.933 --> 01:17:46.027
And a special thanks, of course,
to Mr. Thornton Melon...

01:17:46.069 --> 01:17:49.163
who I don't have to remind
anyone is the donor...

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:52.107
of our new
Melon School of Business.

01:18:00.484 --> 01:18:02.452
We're wasting time.

01:18:02.486 --> 01:18:05.114
Sorry, Phil.

01:18:05.155 --> 01:18:08.454
Now, Mr. Melon,
you'll have three hours...

01:18:08.492 --> 01:18:10.460
to complete the examination.

01:18:10.494 --> 01:18:15.261
If you fail any part of it,
you will be expelled.

01:18:15.298 --> 01:18:17.994
Mr. Melon, do you understand?

01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:22.168
- The Council of Trent.
- Excuse me?

01:18:22.205 --> 01:18:23.729
I missed the question.

01:18:23.773 --> 01:18:25.604
We haven't begun yet.

01:18:27.777 --> 01:18:30.803
Well, Dr. Barbay,
I suppose you're up first.

01:18:45.295 --> 01:18:49.755
I have only one question
for Mr. Melon...

01:18:54.204 --> 01:18:57.367
in 27 parts.

01:19:00.043 --> 01:19:02.773
I'd like to break him
in 27 parts.

01:19:02.812 --> 01:19:04.177
Excuse me?

01:19:04.214 --> 01:19:05.579
No, nothin', nothin'.

01:19:08.618 --> 01:19:11.985
Discuss the foundations of
modern global business systems.

01:19:12.022 --> 01:19:14.786
Part one: Define
and differentiate...

01:19:14.824 --> 01:19:16.792
the three economic
philosophies...

01:19:16.826 --> 01:19:19.021
of capitalism, socialism
and communism...

01:19:19.062 --> 01:19:22.589
as pertains to:
A... management fundamentals;

01:19:22.632 --> 01:19:24.793
B... organizing and staffing;

01:19:24.834 --> 01:19:26.825
C... labor management;

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:29.600
and D... production
and operations.

01:19:29.639 --> 01:19:32.665
Part two...

01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:35.678
Are you getting
all this, Mr. Melon?

01:19:35.712 --> 01:19:38.476
Yeah. It's a piece o' cake.

01:19:41.117 --> 01:19:43.551
Jason?

01:19:48.558 --> 01:19:50.526
Valerie.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:55.122
I wanted to apologize
for the other night...

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:59.568
my behavior
and the things I said.

01:19:59.603 --> 01:20:01.195
And to thank you...

01:20:01.237 --> 01:20:04.434
for your behavior
and the things you said.

01:20:05.575 --> 01:20:09.102
I'm really sorry.

01:20:09.145 --> 01:20:11.170
And I'm really
in love with you...

01:20:11.214 --> 01:20:12.977
and I really have been
for a very long time.

01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:16.144
And I can't believe
I'm saying this.

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:19.087
I don't want
to embarrass you...

01:20:19.122 --> 01:20:22.455
or make you feel
uncomfortable with me...

01:20:22.492 --> 01:20:25.017
but...

01:20:25.061 --> 01:20:30.761
I've been needing to tell you
this for a very long time.

01:20:33.536 --> 01:20:35.766
Are you aware that
that's the most...

01:20:35.805 --> 01:20:38.330
you've ever said to me
at one time?

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:41.742
Except, of course, for the time
that you were ravingly drunk.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.970
I love you, too.

01:21:07.103 --> 01:21:10.834
In response
to Roman numeral 27...

01:21:10.874 --> 01:21:13.843
section three, part two...

01:21:13.877 --> 01:21:17.608
of subset D...
of the question...

01:21:17.647 --> 01:21:20.047
the answer is...

01:21:21.117 --> 01:21:22.778
Mr. Melon?

01:21:30.493 --> 01:21:31.721
Mr. Melon?

01:21:31.761 --> 01:21:35.595
Hey, relax. This man's been put
under a lot of pressure.

01:21:35.632 --> 01:21:37.600
Let's take it easy on him.

01:21:37.634 --> 01:21:39.795
Say it! Say it!

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:44.263
The answer is... four?

01:21:51.481 --> 01:21:52.470
Right.

01:21:59.522 --> 01:22:01.683
Dr. Turner?

01:22:06.563 --> 01:22:09.031
Hold it. That's it.

01:22:09.065 --> 01:22:10.657
I can't take it no more.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:15.330
I feel like I just gave birth
to an accountant.

01:22:16.673 --> 01:22:18.163
Wait a minute, Thornton.

01:22:30.086 --> 01:22:33.920
Thornton, do you remember
when we discussed...

01:22:33.957 --> 01:22:35.515
the Dylan Thomas poem...

01:22:35.558 --> 01:22:38.083
"Do Not Go Gentle
Into That Good Night"?

01:22:38.128 --> 01:22:40.153
I don't know.

01:22:40.196 --> 01:22:42.596
No. Maybe.

01:22:42.632 --> 01:22:44.532
Thornton, think.

01:22:44.567 --> 01:22:46.398
What's going on here?

01:22:47.804 --> 01:22:51.262
Philip, relax. It's my turn.

01:22:55.678 --> 01:22:57.043
Do you remember it?

01:22:58.748 --> 01:23:01.911
"Do not go gentle into...

01:23:01.951 --> 01:23:04.511
"into that good night.

01:23:06.689 --> 01:23:09.419
"Old age should burn
and rage...

01:23:09.459 --> 01:23:13.555
"at close of day.

01:23:13.596 --> 01:23:16.929
"Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

01:23:16.966 --> 01:23:19.400
"Wild men who caught...

01:23:19.435 --> 01:23:22.461
"and sang the sun in flight
and learned too late...

01:23:22.505 --> 01:23:25.201
"they grieved it on its way.

01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:28.802
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

01:23:28.845 --> 01:23:31.507
"Grave men near death...

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:34.016
"who see with blinding sight.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:37.451
"Blind eyes could blaze
like meteors and be gay.

01:23:37.487 --> 01:23:41.685
"Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

01:23:41.724 --> 01:23:46.457
"And you, my father,
there on the sad height.

01:23:46.496 --> 01:23:48.521
"Curse, bless me now...

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:50.499
"with your fierce tears,
I pray.

01:23:50.533 --> 01:23:53.900
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

01:23:53.937 --> 01:23:57.998
"Rage! Rage against
the dying of the light!"

01:23:58.041 --> 01:24:00.839
Thornton, what does that poem
mean to you?

01:24:00.877 --> 01:24:02.970
It means...

01:24:03.012 --> 01:24:05.310
I don't take shit from no one.

01:24:06.749 --> 01:24:08.740
I'm gonna pass this test.

01:24:08.785 --> 01:24:12.346
I'm stayin' in school!
Who's next?

01:24:15.391 --> 01:24:18.451
Now diving for
the Atlantic Eastern Eagles...

01:24:18.494 --> 01:24:22.453
current conference champion...
Doug Nelson.

01:24:22.498 --> 01:24:25.023
You know what you
almost never see?

01:24:25.068 --> 01:24:28.196
Somebody heckling a diver.

01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:43.842
- You're all right, kid.
- Thanks, Lou.

01:24:43.887 --> 01:24:48.551
Please refrain from making
loud noises during the dives.

01:24:50.727 --> 01:24:54.629
Next up, the Atlantic
Eastern Eagles'...

01:24:54.664 --> 01:24:56.689
Bill Steincap.

01:25:15.184 --> 01:25:19.177
That concludes Atlantic
Eastern's ten-meter dives.

01:25:19.222 --> 01:25:22.020
Next up,
the Grand Lakes Hooters.

01:25:24.961 --> 01:25:26.588
We would like to remind you...

01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:28.893
tickets to all Grand Lakes
sporting events...

01:25:28.932 --> 01:25:31.992
are available through
the student services office.

01:25:32.035 --> 01:25:34.128
Are you interested
in Valerie Desmond?

01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:36.764
She's with me.

01:25:36.806 --> 01:25:39.536
Coming into your own,
are you, Melon?

01:25:39.575 --> 01:25:41.042
I wouldn't break my arm...

01:25:41.077 --> 01:25:43.307
patting myself on the back
if I were you.

01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:45.337
Because... get this, towel boy...

01:25:45.381 --> 01:25:48.509
no matter what you think,
you will always be a crude...

01:25:48.551 --> 01:25:51.179
obnoxious, nouveau riche
little phlebe...

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.552
and you're gonna end up
just like your father.

01:25:53.589 --> 01:25:57.548
God, I hope so,
'cause I happen to love the guy.

01:25:57.593 --> 01:26:00.892
First up for
Grand Lakes University...

01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:03.057
Chas Osbourne...

01:26:03.099 --> 01:26:05.829
former national
high school champion.

01:26:33.129 --> 01:26:36.121
- Jason dive yet?
- Not yet. Did you pass?

01:26:36.165 --> 01:26:37.632
I don't know.
They'll let me know.

01:26:37.667 --> 01:26:40.397
Now diving
for Grand Lakes University...

01:26:40.436 --> 01:26:42.768
Jason Melon.

01:27:02.492 --> 01:27:04.517
Attaboy, Jason! You did it!

01:27:09.899 --> 01:27:10.923
All right!

01:27:15.738 --> 01:27:18.206
I can't believe it.
We could actually win this.

01:27:18.241 --> 01:27:22.200
Melon's dive has put the Hooters
back in this meet.

01:27:23.679 --> 01:27:25.146
What's the matter?

01:27:26.682 --> 01:27:28.650
You're up next, Chas.

01:27:31.587 --> 01:27:33.680
I have got
a really bad cramp.

01:27:33.723 --> 01:27:36.021
I've been having
really bad cramps all week.

01:27:36.059 --> 01:27:39.324
- It's probably menstrual.
- Screw you, Melon!

01:27:41.998 --> 01:27:45.957
Coach Turnbull,
you got another eligible diver?

01:27:48.404 --> 01:27:49.871
Melon!

01:27:53.242 --> 01:27:57.542
Melon! We need ya!
Get your suit on!

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:58.706
Go ahead.

01:27:58.748 --> 01:28:00.875
Oh, not a chance.
In the shape I'm in...

01:28:00.917 --> 01:28:03.010
you could donate my body
to science fiction.

01:28:03.052 --> 01:28:05.418
Get your suit on! We need ya!

01:28:05.455 --> 01:28:08.856
Come on, pal.
Show 'em what you got.

01:28:08.891 --> 01:28:11.189
Melon! We need ya!

01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:20.728
Now diving in substitution
for Grand Lakes University...

01:28:20.770 --> 01:28:23.170
Thornton Melon.

01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:27.271
He's on my substitute roster...

01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:29.835
but I don't have it right now.

01:28:29.879 --> 01:28:33.576
But what I'll do is,
first chance I get...

01:28:33.616 --> 01:28:35.174
I'll bring it to you.

01:28:53.569 --> 01:28:56.003
What dive is he gonna do?

01:28:56.038 --> 01:28:58.973
The Triple Lindy.

01:28:59.008 --> 01:29:01.238
Melon! Melon! Melon!

01:29:07.984 --> 01:29:10.544
There will be an additional
springboard installed...

01:29:10.586 --> 01:29:13.384
for Melon's dive,
the Triple Lindy.

01:29:13.422 --> 01:29:15.982
- Is that hard?
- It's impossible.

01:30:39.542 --> 01:30:42.033
Melon! You did it!

01:30:46.949 --> 01:30:48.314
That was great!

01:30:52.955 --> 01:30:56.914
Oh, you were great!
That was incredible!

01:30:56.959 --> 01:30:59.427
I guess there's nothing
you can't do.

01:30:59.462 --> 01:31:01.623
I've got the results
of your exams right here.

01:31:01.664 --> 01:31:02.790
Do I want to hear 'em?

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:05.426
You passed!
All "Ds" and an "A."

01:31:05.468 --> 01:31:07.493
Who gave me the "A"?

01:31:07.536 --> 01:31:09.868
- I did.
- Oh, yeah?

01:31:09.905 --> 01:31:12.499
I would like to introduce
our speaker today.

01:31:12.541 --> 01:31:13.974
This is the first time...

01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:17.411
in the history
of this fine institution...

01:31:17.446 --> 01:31:20.279
that a freshman
has given this address.

01:31:20.316 --> 01:31:22.910
Mr. Thornton Melon.

01:31:35.898 --> 01:31:37.058
Thank you very much.

01:31:37.099 --> 01:31:39.863
Thank you, Dean Martin,
President Sinclair...

01:31:39.902 --> 01:31:42.370
and members
of the graduating class.

01:31:42.405 --> 01:31:45.238
I have only one thing
to say to you today...

01:31:45.274 --> 01:31:46.707
it's a jungle out there.

01:31:46.742 --> 01:31:49.302
You gotta look out
for number one.

01:31:49.345 --> 01:31:52.143
But don't step in number two.

01:31:53.649 --> 01:31:56.675
And so,
to all you graduates...

01:31:56.719 --> 01:32:00.815
as you go out into the world
my advice to you is...

01:32:00.856 --> 01:32:03.825
don't go!
It's rough out there.

01:32:03.859 --> 01:32:06.828
Move back with your parents.
Let them worry about it.
