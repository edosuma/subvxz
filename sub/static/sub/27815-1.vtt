01:44.760 --> 01:45.955
He killed Pete, love.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.070
He snuck into our house

01:50.640 --> 01:51.676
ate at our table

01:52.640 --> 01:55.280
he lied to us, Anna, he lied to you.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.994
- Exactly what Dad did to him.
- He's using you, darlin'.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.040
No, he loves me.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.076
Out you come, Simon.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.320
This'll all be over, mate.
- Don't move.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.310
Always go on two.

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
Remember?

02:09.240 --> 02:10.240
Don't fuck this up.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.512
Jack, Jack, you'll hurt her, Jack.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.116
- Five...
- Jack!

02:15.920 --> 02:17.798
Four, three...

02:22.960 --> 02:24.440
Anna, Anna, Anna!

02:34.240 --> 02:35.390
I don't hate you, Jack.

02:36.880 --> 02:37.880
I love you.

02:38.840 --> 02:39.956
I've always loved you.

02:40.760 --> 02:41.796
I love you too, mate.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.999
No! No! Whitey!

02:51.080 --> 02:51.911
Whitey!

02:52.080 --> 02:53.080
No, no...

03:01.760 --> 03:02.760
Jack!

04:05.520 --> 04:06.520
Chico?

04:08.720 --> 04:09.720
Pretty cold?

04:21.200 --> 04:22.395
I'll get you a blanket.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.280
Jesus!

05:24.560 --> 05:25.391
Jesus, Jack.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.560
No...

05:27.560 --> 05:29.119
Please, please...

05:35.800 --> 05:37.200
Oh, fuck! Shit!

05:37.440 --> 05:38.920
Don't you die on her, you bastard.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.833
Don't you dare die on her, d'you hear me?

05:42.040 --> 05:43.040
Where is it?

05:45.400 --> 05:46.400
Oh, shit.

05:46.960 --> 05:47.960
Fuck!

05:48.560 --> 05:50.279
Don't go to sleep, Jack, Jack!

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
Don't go to sleep.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.631
Jack!

05:53.760 --> 05:55.035
Stay awake, don't go to sleep.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.959
I'm gonna stop the bleeding...

06:03.560 --> 06:05.040
Don't worry, Jack!

06:14.040 --> 06:15.040

06:16.160 --> 06:17.160
Anna!

06:18.960 --> 06:19.996
Anna, come back!

06:26.160 --> 06:27.276
Jesus, Jack...

06:30.720 --> 06:31.720
Fuck you, Jack!

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
Fuck you!

06:47.560 --> 06:48.560
God, I love you.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.440
Goodbye, Jack.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.800
Anna!

07:30.640 --> 07:31.640
Anna!

08:04.360 --> 08:06.317
<i>...you're just not mother material.</i>

08:06.360 --> 08:08.000
What do you mean I'm not mother material?

08:08.440 --> 08:10.432
I pay your mortgage and the kids' tuition.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.475
<i>What's your point?</i>

08:12.640 --> 08:13.869
I want them here this summer.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.136
The house is almost ready,
Katie can learn to ride and...

08:16.160 --> 08:18.038
<i>You think Katie wants to learn to ride?</i>

08:18.080 --> 08:21.630
<i>My God, Elizabeth,
if you spent any time around your kids</i>

08:21.680 --> 08:25.071
<i>or even just checked in once in a while,
you'd know Katie has no interest...</i>

08:25.120 --> 08:26.120
I miss them.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.676
<i>You miss them?</i>

08:28.120 --> 08:31.318
<i>I hate to tell you, but guess what?
This isn't about you.</i>

08:48.640 --> 08:49.676
Can I have two of these?

09:15.920 --> 09:16.920
Elizabeth.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
You here for business?

09:23.360 --> 09:24.360
There you go.

09:26.640 --> 09:27.790
Reinforcements.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.240
Say something.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.320
Anything.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.319
Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night

10:10.360 --> 10:12.352
someone was killed
'neath the town hall light.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.030
There were few at the scene
and they all agreed

10:16.080 --> 10:18.231
that the slayer who ran looked a lot like me.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.877
The judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?

10:22.600 --> 10:24.910
You were somewhere else,
you won't have to die."

10:26.560 --> 10:29.394
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.350
I'd been in the arms
of my best friend's wife.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.750
Congratulations.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.120
Six-twelve.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.040
Anna!

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
Anna!

13:33.880 --> 13:34.880
Anna, come back!

13:36.960 --> 13:37.960
Shit...

14:20.240 --> 14:21.640
Elizabeth Bradshaw?

14:22.680 --> 14:23.680
Yes?

14:23.840 --> 14:25.115
I come from downtown.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.160
But they just promoted me.
This doesn't make any sense.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.312
You need me to clarify, ma'am?

14:42.360 --> 14:43.360
What?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.876
Put the legalese into plain English?

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
You're fired.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.240
Good day to you.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.080
Hey.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.480
Hey!

15:01.520 --> 15:02.520
Ma'am?

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
Who the hell are you?

15:03.800 --> 15:05.200
I represent the shareholders.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.232
OK, well you clarify this
for the shareholders.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.680
They can go fuck themselves.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.696
You tell them they're fucking with
the wrong woman.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.234
How's that for plain English?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.120
Clear, cowboy?

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
Crystal.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.480
Fuck...

16:54.560 --> 16:56.640
- Who's on the other end of that?
- Beijing.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.439
Beijing?
- New partners.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.311
OK, Beijing. Have you ever heard of
corporate manslaughter?

17:04.760 --> 17:08.310
Cos in Canada, an organisation is guilty
of corporate manslaughter

17:08.680 --> 17:12.230
if the way in which its activities
are conducted causes a person's death.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.520
For example...

17:15.040 --> 17:19.990
if a burst pipe from a carbon storage
facility were to kill innocent children.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.636
We recommend that you retract any and all
allegations against this company

17:23.680 --> 17:26.275
its parent company, any affiliates
or any of its employees

17:26.319 --> 17:29.040
and refrain from making any further
allegations.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.198
Have we met?
- Or we'll go to the police.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.320
Oh, I think the sooner the authorities
know about this the better.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.950
We'll press charges for extortion.
- Extortion?

17:38.200 --> 17:39.520
I'm a bona fide whistle blower.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.190
"Everyone commits extortion
who with the intent to obtain anything

17:43.240 --> 17:46.199
by threats or accusations,
menaces or violence..."

17:46.240 --> 17:47.310
I know what extortion is.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.955
"...induces or attempts to induce any person
to do any thing

17:50.000 --> 17:51.936
or cause anything to be done."
- And I know the law.

17:51.960 --> 17:52.960
In your case...

17:53.080 --> 17:54.080
a promotion.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.816
Do you really want to go to court?
- Extortion is an indictable offence.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.231
So it is liable to imprisonment.
We'd see to it that you served five years.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.590
And what makes you think
I'm not prepared to go to jail?

18:12.880 --> 18:14.951
Those two individuals are detectives.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.317
Go one step further and we'll turn you over
to the Federal Police.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.676
If you're firing me,
I'm entitled to a severance package.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.315
I'm afraid you relieved us of any obligation
to remunerate you

18:34.360 --> 18:35.476
when you broke the law.

18:37.760 --> 18:38.955
I'll take two week's salary.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.151
You'll vacate the premises immediately,
Ms Bradshaw

18:41.200 --> 18:42.616
or you will be escorted off of them.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.960
Were you bullied in school?

18:44.120 --> 18:44.951
Excuse me?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.256
Do you ruin people's lives for a living
because you're hurting inside

18:47.280 --> 18:49.431
or because you're a heartless cunt?
- Security.

18:51.920 --> 18:52.920
Don't touch me.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.840
I said get your hands off me.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.440
Stop!

19:00.360 --> 19:01.191
Stop it!

19:57.680 --> 19:58.680
Oh, shit...

20:01.360 --> 20:02.360
Anna?

20:09.760 --> 20:10.760
Anna!

20:48.920 --> 20:50.752
Oh!

20:57.080 --> 20:58.080
Hello?

20:58.240 --> 20:59.594
<i>We're screwed.</i>

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
What?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.552
Northstream Oil called the cops.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.216
<i>What if they know something?</i>

21:06.240 --> 21:07.240
So what?

21:08.360 --> 21:09.589
<i>This is serious.</i>

21:11.840 --> 21:12.956
My daughter's lost.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.315
<i>She could die up here, I need to get help.</i>

21:17.200 --> 21:19.795
Where are you?
- On Moose Mountain.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.679
<i>Angela, I'm on my way.</i>

21:21.720 --> 21:22.790
<i>Don't call the police yet.</i>

21:23.800 --> 21:25.439
We'll find her, OK?

21:25.480 --> 21:26.480
<i>Hurry.</i>

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Oh!

21:59.240 --> 22:01.675
<i>...which in turn may bring
sub-zero temperatures</i>

22:01.720 --> 22:03.757
<i>of up to minus 25 degrees.</i>

22:04.080 --> 22:05.150
<i>And with that cold air</i>

22:05.200 --> 22:08.113
<i>we're expecting a good deal
higher than average snowfalls</i>

22:08.160 --> 22:10.231

Hey.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.520
How you feeling?

27:34.720 --> 27:35.720
Peachy.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.635
What did the surgeon say?

27:37.720 --> 27:40.360
I get to wheel myself around in that
for the rest of my life.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.736
What? I just spoke to the nurse,
she didn't say anything

27:42.760 --> 27:44.896
about the rest of your life.
- She's probably under the impression

27:44.920 --> 27:46.036
you might give a crap.

27:47.360 --> 27:48.360
That's not fair.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.720
Do you love me?

27:55.600 --> 27:56.829
Yes.
- Telling pause.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.816
Which direction did the chief drive off in?

28:04.840 --> 28:06.991
Swiftly followed by the mother of all segues.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.856
You were the last person to see him.
- I have stared death in the face, Denise.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.200
I think I can take the truth.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.240
Hey.

28:23.840 --> 28:24.876
It's over, isn't it?

28:25.880 --> 28:26.880
No.

28:28.320 --> 28:32.280
Look, I... don't expect you to date a cripple
for the rest of your life.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.776
You do you think I want to suffer
the indignity

28:35.800 --> 28:38.315
of being helped on and off the John
by the woman I love?

28:38.640 --> 28:41.075
I don't even know if I still have
what it takes to...

28:46.720 --> 28:48.200
to make love to you, Denise.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.360
It was a glancing blow to the kneecap.
- He tried to kill me.

28:51.400 --> 28:54.040
If the chief wanted to kill you,
you would be dead.

29:01.800 --> 29:02.800
I'm gonna kill him.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.960
Great.
- Just so you know.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.240
Which way did he go?

29:22.920 --> 29:24.912

30:23.760 --> 30:25.114
She knew this place.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.593
I thought maybe she'd come back here.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Why?

30:52.200 --> 30:53.200
Hey.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.878
"Chief Worth Ward", that's what this place
should be called.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.629
Victims of.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.714
What happened?
- She fell.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.600
What?
- Down some stairs.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.678
What about you?
- Me? I broke her fall.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.473
Well, you know... tried to.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.078
I don't know. Stupid, eh?

31:11.600 --> 31:13.751
My partner says he saw
the chief coming into your bar.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.560
Alright, listen, sweetheart.
No doubt you're a great copper, yeah.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.280
Salt of the earth.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.072
Pillar of the local community, it's just...

31:21.840 --> 31:24.230
I'm not sure you're equipped
to deal with all this.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.950
I mean, no offence,
but you're Canadian for starters.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.674
I'm not Canadian, I'm Musqwa.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.760
You'll stop him, won't you?

31:31.240 --> 31:32.754
Why would the chief want to hurt you?

31:32.800 --> 31:34.029
This an interview?

31:34.280 --> 31:36.511
Cos if it is, I'd like a solicitor.
- Excuse me?

31:36.560 --> 31:37.560
A lawyer.

31:38.840 --> 31:39.956
You'd better get one then.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.555
She could have helped us.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.256
He should be dead by now.
- What if he isn't, Frank?

31:50.280 --> 31:51.191
I say he is, Randy.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.391
I say we forget all about him, OK? I say...

31:53.440 --> 31:54.556
What if he comes back?

32:11.720 --> 32:13.320
Back at the cabin, that blood?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.034
- I've no idea.
- Really?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.536
You sure this isn't the second house
you've burnt down?

32:17.560 --> 32:19.233
There's not another body
buried somewhere?

32:19.280 --> 32:20.680
I found her phone here.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.674
She must have gone to the top.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.160
What, are you calling the police?

32:25.200 --> 32:26.998
I should have done it in the first place.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.873
You need to start telling me the truth.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.320
Oh, shit, I've got no signal.

32:31.560 --> 32:32.560
Anna!

33:15.080 --> 33:16.080
Anna!

33:18.400 --> 33:19.834
We should go back to the car.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.394
Not without my daughter.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.591
The weather's getting worse, this is crazy.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.836
You have children, you should know better.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.520
Anna!

33:32.640 --> 33:33.640
Anna!

33:42.800 --> 33:43.800
Enough!

33:44.800 --> 33:45.916
We go back down!

33:46.920 --> 33:48.195
She'll die up here.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.351
Anna!

33:50.440 --> 33:55.117
This is suicide! I'm taking you back down
the mountain if I have to drag you.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.037
You drag me down this mountain,
I'll shoot you.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.550
You'll shoot me?

34:03.040 --> 34:05.475
OK. Fuck you!

34:07.320 --> 34:10.438
You want to die up here, go ahead.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.480
Kill yourself.

34:46.159 --> 34:47.159
Anna?

35:47.800 --> 35:48.800
Anna!

36:05.320 --> 36:06.320
