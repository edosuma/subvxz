WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:01.585
Why don't we go around the room

00:01.587 --> 00:04.340
and everyone tell us your name

00:04.341 --> 00:06.980
and, uh, what brings you here.

00:07.589 --> 00:09.750
Why don't we start with, uh, you?

00:10.781 --> 00:12.341
Uh, okay. Yeah, hi.

00:12.342 --> 00:14.525
Uh, I'm Amy Sosa.

00:14.527 --> 00:16.711
Um, sorry, am I supposed to be standing?

00:16.713 --> 00:18.396
- Should I...
- It doesn't matter.

00:18.398 --> 00:20.031
Well, then I'll just roll with standing,

00:20.033 --> 00:21.485
since I'm already up here.

00:21.486 --> 00:23.167
Hope the rest of you stand

00:23.169 --> 00:25.069
so I don't look like such a weirdo.

00:27.140 --> 00:28.021
Okay, all right.

00:28.022 --> 00:31.576
Um, well, so, I have been
at Cloud 9 for 16 years.

00:31.578 --> 00:33.411
And I have always heard of

00:33.413 --> 00:35.279
the management training program,

00:35.281 --> 00:37.098
and I finally thought to myself,

00:37.100 --> 00:38.499
"Forget that blue vest,

00:38.501 --> 00:41.169
you better get that cloud tie, girl."

00:43.123 --> 00:44.202
So I'm very excited.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.258
- Um, I think...
- I'm Cheyenne.

00:47.260 --> 00:48.810
I work with Amy.

00:48.812 --> 00:51.295
Um, she suggested I come to the program,

00:51.297 --> 00:52.897
so I just thought, "Why not"?

00:52.899 --> 00:54.866
So long as she'd give me a ride.

00:54.868 --> 00:58.002
I can't drive right now,
'cause I have bees in my car.

00:58.004 --> 00:59.404
Um, okay thanks.

00:59.406 --> 01:02.590
Ladies, this is the
embalming conference.

01:04.327 --> 01:05.843
- Oh.
- Okay, yeah.

01:05.845 --> 01:07.295
I think we're in the wrong room.

01:07.297 --> 01:09.555
We should... we'll just go.

01:14.886 --> 01:17.136
To make the process easier,
we've broken down...

01:17.137 --> 01:17.497
Hi.

01:18.157 --> 01:21.021
- Is this the Cloud 9 Academy?
- Yeah, shh, mmhmm.

01:21.023 --> 01:21.631
Okay.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.672
Ooh, that was loud.

01:24.673 --> 01:26.728
<i>The first "L" of Leadership is loyalty.</i>

01:26.729 --> 01:27.960
<i>Leaders are loyal...</i>

01:27.961 --> 01:31.461
Um, whoa, sorry,
would you sit over there

01:31.462 --> 01:33.039
so I could sit next to my friend?

01:33.040 --> 01:33.770
Oh, no, Cheyenne, it's okay.

01:33.771 --> 01:35.458
Why don't you just take that chair?

01:35.831 --> 01:37.645
Oh. Um, okay.

01:37.646 --> 01:39.529
<i>Leaders never stop learning.</i>

01:39.530 --> 01:41.175
<i>Failure can be scary,</i>

01:41.177 --> 01:42.416
<i>but it's not something to fear...</i>

01:43.215 --> 01:45.836
<i>You learn from every mistake
you make along the way.</i>

01:46.846 --> 01:47.539
Ooh.

01:47.794 --> 01:49.086
There goes my jacket.

01:51.254 --> 01:54.054
<i>We were given two ears
and one mouth for a reason.</i>

01:54.056 --> 01:56.857
<i>We should all try to spend
more time listening...</i>

01:56.859 --> 01:58.782
Could you just, um,
scoot over a little bit?

01:58.783 --> 02:01.118
Then I'll... I'll have enough
room to sit here too.

02:02.465 --> 02:04.466
'Cause I'm in the aisle right now, so...

02:05.433 --> 02:09.014
<i>Because we don't have to hold the
specific position to be leaders.</i>

02:09.015 --> 02:09.840
Thank you.

02:11.463 --> 02:13.167
I don't understand
why they make it so hard

02:13.168 --> 02:14.214
to apply for asylum.

02:14.661 --> 02:17.011
Applying to be a refugee was even worse.

02:17.013 --> 02:17.776
Really?

02:18.149 --> 02:19.785
No wonder we have so few refugees.

02:19.786 --> 02:22.243
I don't understand how
you could apply for asylum.

02:22.244 --> 02:23.825
It's not easy.

02:24.385 --> 02:26.190
"List your extended family."

02:26.191 --> 02:28.616
I'm Filipino, that'll take years.

02:28.617 --> 02:30.544
Says you need to show that
if you were sent back,

02:30.545 --> 02:32.368
you might be persecuted based on your,

02:32.369 --> 02:35.019
"race, religion,
nationality, political opinion,

02:35.020 --> 02:37.205
or membership in a particular
social group."

02:37.854 --> 02:40.257
Well, I was in an a cappella
group once in school.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.403
I mean, we weren't persecuted,

02:42.405 --> 02:43.848
but people were really judge-y.

02:43.849 --> 02:45.489
I think they mean
more like if you thought

02:45.490 --> 02:47.541
you might be arrested because
you were, like, a prominent

02:47.543 --> 02:48.879
Duterte critic or something.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.711
Do you think they'd believe
Duterte would have me killed

02:50.713 --> 02:51.902
for being in an a capella group?

02:51.903 --> 02:53.239
'Cause we were really bad.

02:53.429 --> 02:54.930
Well, not me, I was good,

02:54.931 --> 02:56.727
but one guy was off-key all the time.

02:57.033 --> 03:01.127
Okay, Rose, say hi to everyone.

03:01.128 --> 03:03.524
Say hi. Say hi, come on.

03:03.752 --> 03:06.002
Say hi. Say hi.

03:06.796 --> 03:07.883
That's it, say hi.

03:07.884 --> 03:09.673
Okay, do we have to wait
till she develops speech,

03:09.674 --> 03:10.724
or can we just move on?

03:10.725 --> 03:13.578
It's Jerusha's day
to clean our pastor's gutters,

03:13.579 --> 03:15.547
so I get to bring her in.

03:15.548 --> 03:16.822
Dina, can you hold her for a bit

03:16.823 --> 03:18.649
while I set up her things in my office?

03:18.650 --> 03:20.229
Ooh, yeah, I'm really not a baby person.

03:20.230 --> 03:22.613
And for future reference,
I'm also not a wool sock person

03:22.614 --> 03:23.635
or a reptile person.

03:24.313 --> 03:27.087
But she's not just some random baby.

03:27.088 --> 03:29.136
She lived in you for nine months.

03:29.137 --> 03:30.933
Yeah, I guess it's like
if you're shopping at Goodwill,

03:30.934 --> 03:32.736
and you see an old shirt
of yours you donated,

03:32.737 --> 03:34.310
and you go, "Hey, that was my shirt."

03:34.311 --> 03:35.889
And for a second it feels meaningful,

03:35.890 --> 03:38.233
but then you realize it's not.

03:39.261 --> 03:39.842
Fine.

03:40.272 --> 03:42.085
Uncle Garrett, looks like you're up.

03:42.086 --> 03:44.031
Oh, no I don't think that's a good idea.

03:44.033 --> 03:46.634
- I'm not good with kids.
- Just don't shake her.

03:46.636 --> 03:47.986
- Okay, so this is happening.
- Oh, my Gosh.

03:47.987 --> 03:49.585
- Okay. Okay.
- You're a natural.

03:50.324 --> 03:51.842
Daddy loves you, Rose.

03:51.843 --> 03:54.009
Yeah, if Daddy loved you,

03:54.011 --> 03:55.744
he would have gotten you a babysitter.

03:55.804 --> 03:57.437
Why don't you think about that?

03:59.378 --> 04:00.873
It seems like a good spread,

04:00.874 --> 04:03.360
but it was an even better
spread last year.

04:03.686 --> 04:05.138
They had cereal.

04:05.139 --> 04:06.135
Mmm.

04:06.382 --> 04:08.873
So, if you were here last year,

04:08.874 --> 04:10.595
why are you taking the class again?

04:11.267 --> 04:13.315
'Cause I didn't pass the first time.

04:14.151 --> 04:15.781
Thanks for making me say it.

04:15.782 --> 04:18.464
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean to...

04:22.397 --> 04:23.585
Excuse me, hi.

04:23.586 --> 04:24.571
Quick question:

04:24.572 --> 04:27.106
Is this a class that people fail often?

04:27.107 --> 04:29.476
Well, I mean, I wouldn't like
to call it "failing,"

04:29.478 --> 04:31.357
but yeah, people fail.

04:31.981 --> 04:32.569
Oh.

04:33.683 --> 04:35.282
I thought this was just sort of like

04:35.284 --> 04:37.866
a introductory seminar.

04:37.867 --> 04:40.254
If you don't mind,
this is a short break,

04:40.256 --> 04:41.805
and I'm trying to eat my breakfast.

04:41.806 --> 04:43.562
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, sorry.

04:43.563 --> 04:44.873
Danish away.

04:45.598 --> 04:46.840
I'm just gonna...

04:48.013 --> 04:49.757
It's just, I'm a little bit concerned,

04:49.758 --> 04:52.818
because I've waited so long
to do the manager thing

04:52.819 --> 04:55.219
and to kind of find out
all of a sudden that

04:55.221 --> 04:57.022
I could potentially fail out
on the first day...

04:57.023 --> 04:59.805
We only get so many breaks,
so I'm gonna hit this.

05:00.242 --> 05:03.471
Yeah, no, you should hit it. Yeah, okay.

05:06.115 --> 05:08.282
Just wanna make sure that
the interrupting thing

05:08.284 --> 05:10.184
isn't gonna affect the pass/fail...

05:10.186 --> 05:12.152
You know what, [bleep],
let's just start.

05:12.154 --> 05:13.175
Let's just start!

05:15.558 --> 05:19.391
So I was just folding pants,
and I had the best idea:

05:20.062 --> 05:21.589
I should take down Duterte.

05:21.897 --> 05:24.013
And you got that from pants?

05:24.014 --> 05:25.876
It's just so I qualify for asylum,

05:25.877 --> 05:27.727
but here, check out my Facebook page

05:28.130 --> 05:30.863
- "Ermagherd, Duterte."
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.099
"Rodrigo Duterte doesn't
respect human rights,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.384
but that's none of my business,"

05:34.385 --> 05:37.137
over a picture of
Kermit the Frog sipping tea.

05:37.138 --> 05:38.216
That one's got a lot of likes.

05:38.217 --> 05:40.660
Yeah, I don't know that
reposting a bunch of memes

05:40.661 --> 05:42.358
qualifies you as a political dissident.

05:42.752 --> 05:43.830
Well, then what would?

05:44.259 --> 05:45.391
I don't know, uh...

05:45.917 --> 05:49.556
Actually being the leader
of an actual activist group

05:49.558 --> 05:51.319
that actually opposes Duterte.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.172
Ugh, okay, fine.

05:54.191 --> 05:56.202
Marcus, I'm starting a group, you in?

05:56.203 --> 05:57.380
Definitely.

05:59.628 --> 06:01.180
Revolution begins.

06:01.946 --> 06:04.542
Now in the warehouse,
if your non-con feeders

06:04.543 --> 06:06.238
are doing full pallet pick...

06:06.239 --> 06:09.393
Amy, hey. What's a "non-con"?

06:09.395 --> 06:11.161
Non-conveyable, it's in the book.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.714
Amy, could you focus up, please?

06:13.716 --> 06:15.449
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

06:15.451 --> 06:19.419
I was just, um... I'm sorry.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.002
Anyway, it's called a warehouse,

06:23.592 --> 06:24.618
but don't let it wear you out.

06:27.737 --> 06:29.960
Sorry, I... I'm just...
I'm laughing because

06:29.961 --> 06:32.204
I was listening... to you.

06:32.835 --> 06:35.936
It's not my joke.
It's part of the lesson plan.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.194
You delivered it funny.

06:41.219 --> 06:43.334
So the next thing I would do is say,

06:43.335 --> 06:44.972
"Well, you better listen to me

06:44.974 --> 06:46.857
"or else I'm gonna go in the break room

06:46.859 --> 06:49.560
"and sprinkle a little bit of
pee on your food every day

06:49.562 --> 06:51.812
until all you're eating is pee."

06:51.814 --> 06:53.149
Uh-huh.

06:53.150 --> 06:56.567
Uh, preferred answer would be
find someone else

06:56.569 --> 06:57.842
to work the holiday.

06:57.843 --> 07:02.069
But, uh, thank you for sharing.
That was horrifying.

07:02.909 --> 07:06.066
All right, so, now you guys
are going to design

07:06.067 --> 07:09.129
a program to improve
customer satisfaction.

07:09.131 --> 07:11.298
Everyone pick a partner,
and choose wisely,

07:11.300 --> 07:15.135
the wrong partner can
literally ruin your life.

07:15.137 --> 07:17.249
- Oh, you...
- Wanna work together?

07:18.418 --> 07:21.842
Uh, well, um... I... I don't...

07:21.844 --> 07:24.311
Gary, uh, probably not a great idea

07:24.313 --> 07:26.730
to work with someone
we already know, right?

07:26.732 --> 07:28.015
Oh, I don't care.

07:28.017 --> 07:31.636
Oh, well, Gary doesn't care, so, yeah.

07:31.938 --> 07:32.994
Baller.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.488
I was afraid I was gonna get
stuck with some dunce.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.744
Mm-hmm. That would suck.

07:38.694 --> 07:39.690
Okay, how 'bout

07:39.996 --> 07:42.112
the International Anti-Duterte Society?

07:42.114 --> 07:43.779
I-A-D-S.

07:44.050 --> 07:46.250
No, wait, that's too close to AIDS.

07:46.252 --> 07:47.785
People don't wanna join something that

07:47.787 --> 07:48.474
reminds them of AIDS.

07:48.475 --> 07:51.056
Right, right.

07:51.757 --> 07:52.311
Okay.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.225
Outraged People...

07:55.928 --> 07:57.962
Rallying Against Hate.

07:58.662 --> 08:01.765
Are you just working
backwards from Oprah?

08:01.767 --> 08:03.968
I was, that's exactly what I was doing.

08:03.970 --> 08:05.135
I like it.

08:05.137 --> 08:07.393
You get asylum, you get asylum.

08:07.974 --> 08:09.306
It's what she does.

08:09.308 --> 08:10.724
Yeah, I know. I... I got it.

08:10.726 --> 08:11.366
Okay.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:25.688 --> 08:27.116
Ow.

08:31.213 --> 08:33.553
Really, this is how you care for a baby?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.883
You just throw it in a cart
like a sack of margarine.

08:35.885 --> 08:37.083
"Sack of margarine"?

08:37.086 --> 08:38.585
Fine, bag of butter.

08:38.587 --> 08:40.054
Look, she's perfectly safe in there.

08:40.056 --> 08:41.337
You wanna take care of her?

08:41.337 --> 08:42.806
God, no.

08:42.808 --> 08:44.925
All right.

08:49.849 --> 08:51.348
Nope, uh-uh.

08:51.350 --> 08:53.233
I'm not gonna let you
treat a baby this way.

08:53.235 --> 08:54.852
Not even Glenn's baby.

08:54.854 --> 08:56.937
It's not your fault
your daddy's an idiot.

08:56.939 --> 08:59.618
Oh, okay.

08:59.619 --> 09:01.408
We'll go play some checkers or chess

09:01.410 --> 09:02.943
or Trivial Pursuit, huh?

09:04.914 --> 09:06.413
Wasn't crying in the cart.

09:06.415 --> 09:09.116
Okay, so, what if
we tried something like

09:09.118 --> 09:11.035
allowing our frequent customers

09:11.037 --> 09:13.003
to double up on their rewards points?

09:13.005 --> 09:16.707
Okay, or we could have, like,
a Cloud 9 gnome,

09:16.709 --> 09:18.759
and sometimes he would
give people, like,

09:18.761 --> 09:20.377
a hundred bucks,
but other times we would, like,

09:20.379 --> 09:21.441
squirt them with ink.

09:21.442 --> 09:24.138
And it's like, "Am I gonna
risk getting gnomed"?

09:24.884 --> 09:26.967
I like that area.

09:26.969 --> 09:29.803
Um, building on it, what if we had

09:29.805 --> 09:31.972
complimentary coffee for customers

09:31.974 --> 09:33.898
the first hour of every morning?

09:34.643 --> 09:36.944
Hmm, that sounds a little boring.

09:36.946 --> 09:39.897
Really? 'Cause I think it sounds cool.

09:39.899 --> 09:42.159
Morning coffee, we are on a roll.

09:42.952 --> 09:46.713
Amy, we're partners.
We can't just do your ideas.

09:47.323 --> 09:49.073
Yeah, no, I know. I know that.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.499
I'm sorry.

09:50.500 --> 09:54.461
Okay, what if every Tuesday
is Mardi Gras day,

09:54.463 --> 09:56.728
and the less you wear, the less you pay?

09:57.459 --> 10:01.168
Mardi Gras Tuesdays, okay.
I'm gonna write that down.

10:01.170 --> 10:03.866
And I also wanna re-pitch my gnome idea.

10:06.142 --> 10:07.674
What do we think about this frog?

10:07.676 --> 10:09.426
It's very soft, but anatomically,

10:09.428 --> 10:11.428
they took a lot of liberties.

10:11.430 --> 10:12.629
This seems like a lot of work

10:12.630 --> 10:14.587
for a baby you don't have
feelings about.

10:14.984 --> 10:16.640
No, I mean, it's a human child,

10:16.641 --> 10:17.761
I don't wish it ill will.

10:17.762 --> 10:18.967
I'm not a psychopath.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.188
I just don't particularly care
more about this baby

10:21.190 --> 10:22.689
than I do about that one.

10:22.691 --> 10:24.191
Who the hell is that baby?

10:24.193 --> 10:25.826
Uh, thanks. I'll be right back.

10:25.828 --> 10:26.866
I just gotta grab a few things.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.245
Oh, no this isn't child care.

10:28.247 --> 10:30.080
Oh, no, we don't provide this service.

10:30.082 --> 10:31.865
See, that's what it looks like

10:31.867 --> 10:33.534
when you don't care about a baby.

10:34.420 --> 10:35.611
Okay.

10:41.127 --> 10:42.876
Good.

10:46.882 --> 10:48.215
Come on, no.

10:48.217 --> 10:50.517
No. No.

10:50.519 --> 10:51.769
No.

10:53.389 --> 10:54.388
Hello.

10:54.390 --> 10:56.432
Oh, hey, Janet.

10:56.433 --> 10:59.109
Oh, yay. Hey, it's Glenn.

10:59.111 --> 11:01.278
- Who?
- Glenn, Glenn Sturgis.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.286
I'll connect you.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.864
No, no, no, Janet, don't hang up.

11:03.866 --> 11:06.984
Don't...

11:09.738 --> 11:10.848
Glenn Sturgis.

11:11.407 --> 11:13.240
Stop Rodrigo Duterte.

11:13.242 --> 11:15.909
He's ruthless, he's anti-free speech.

11:15.911 --> 11:18.327
He's also brown
if any racists are interested.

11:18.328 --> 11:20.554
Hey, Sandra, are you busy later?

11:20.833 --> 11:22.882
Actually, yeah.

11:23.419 --> 11:26.003
We're pulling the plug
on my grandmother tonight.

11:26.005 --> 11:28.088
She was doing better for a while,

11:28.090 --> 11:31.558
then after her last stroke,
she just never bounced back.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.942
Well, that... that sounds terrible.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.263
I... I... we were just gonna ask
you to come to a meeting,

11:36.265 --> 11:37.010
but obviously you don't need...

11:37.010 --> 11:37.876
I can come.

11:38.347 --> 11:40.899
I just made that up
to sound like I had plans.

11:42.438 --> 11:44.634
Ooh, see you there.

11:46.442 --> 11:48.410
All right. Whoo.

11:50.831 --> 11:52.779
She's really fallen apart

11:52.781 --> 11:54.114
since that whole Jerry/Carol thing.

11:54.116 --> 11:55.745
- She is not okay.
- Yeah.

11:56.502 --> 11:59.614
Because by working together
we can achieve sat...

12:00.602 --> 12:02.039
- Iss...
- Faction.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.254
Faction.

12:03.972 --> 12:07.985
Wow, okay, a real mix of ideas there.

12:08.091 --> 12:11.727
Some good, some a bit more terrible.

12:11.728 --> 12:14.564
But they tell us to start with the good,

12:14.566 --> 12:16.970
so free coffee in the
mornings, I like that.

12:17.569 --> 12:19.802
Thank you, we were
really proud of that one.

12:20.430 --> 12:22.973
Yeah, that was...
that was a team effort.

12:22.974 --> 12:24.777
And I actually really love

12:24.778 --> 12:27.163
follow-up calls after large purchases.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.578
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:28.580 --> 12:29.742
Thanks. Thank you.

12:29.743 --> 12:31.272
Okay, now for the bad.

12:31.273 --> 12:34.130
Back-to-school belly button
piercings, awful.

12:34.131 --> 12:36.548
Cardi B appreciation days, terrible.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.860
And I can't comment on this
'cause I don't know what it is.

12:39.861 --> 12:41.138
What's... what's an aisle maze?

12:41.139 --> 12:43.604
I was a little bit confused
about some of those ideas too,

12:43.605 --> 12:45.679
but I believe they were
Cheyenne's ideas,

12:45.681 --> 12:48.468
so Cheyenne could probably
explain it better.

12:48.469 --> 12:51.096
Um, w... what did you mean by
an aisle maze?

12:55.751 --> 12:57.541
An aisle maze is...

12:58.041 --> 13:01.002
when you move the aisles
around to make a maze.

13:01.003 --> 13:02.237
That was the idea.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.731
Yeah, it's one of those situations where

13:04.732 --> 13:07.003
the explanation doesn't make
the idea any better.

13:07.102 --> 13:07.645
Yeah.

13:09.316 --> 13:11.403
So, up next we're gonna do
a little role-play.

13:11.643 --> 13:13.118
Amy, why don't you be the manager,

13:13.120 --> 13:14.119
and you're gonna talk to Cheyenne about

13:14.121 --> 13:16.498
her repeated absences.

13:17.158 --> 13:19.796
Your job is to communicate
your expectations

13:20.016 --> 13:22.433
without making her feel like
she's being attacked.

13:22.463 --> 13:23.149
Okay?

13:23.583 --> 13:25.917
And... go.

13:27.625 --> 13:31.306
Um, hey, Cheyenne, you've been missing

13:31.308 --> 13:32.841
quite a bit of work lately.

13:32.843 --> 13:35.260
Um, I'm sorry, can we, um, time out?

13:35.262 --> 13:37.395
'Cause I'm starting to feel
attacked right now.

13:37.641 --> 13:40.148
How was I attacking you?

13:40.150 --> 13:42.183
Well, it wasn't so much the words,

13:42.185 --> 13:45.153
but the way that she
is looking at me right now

13:45.155 --> 13:47.522
just makes it seem like
she is really angry.

13:47.524 --> 13:48.848
No, I... I wasn't.

13:48.849 --> 13:50.744
Hey, Amy, if that's what
you're giving off,

13:50.795 --> 13:52.318
try to accept it and correct it.

13:53.914 --> 13:54.825
Okay.

13:56.999 --> 13:58.083
Hey, sweetie.

14:00.454 --> 14:03.038
Harrison, stop burping
into the intercom.

14:04.257 --> 14:06.124
Thank you so much.

14:06.126 --> 14:08.259
Okay, Piper, Peppa, be good.

14:08.261 --> 14:10.128
Oh, wait, no, this isn't a daycare.

14:10.415 --> 14:12.329
Our mailman's now our dad.

14:14.239 --> 14:16.698
Cool. Have a seat on the rug.

14:17.554 --> 14:20.572
Thank you all for coming to
the inaugural meeting of, uh,

14:20.574 --> 14:22.941
St. Louis Society Against Duterte.

14:25.145 --> 14:26.374
SLSAD.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.883
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.701
So, what kind of stuff
are we gonna be doing?

14:34.643 --> 14:36.555
That is a good question.

14:37.713 --> 14:39.661
Jonah, wanna handle this one?

14:40.932 --> 14:44.212
Um, we could... start with

14:44.214 --> 14:46.548
- a letter-writing campaign.
- Yes.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.316
Who would we write letters to?

14:49.329 --> 14:50.668
I guess Duterte.

14:50.893 --> 14:52.337
So does anyone know his address?

14:52.339 --> 14:54.422
Duterte imprisoned a lot of my family.

14:54.424 --> 14:56.502
I'd rather not be pen pals with him.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.259
Guys, we should march on something.

14:58.261 --> 14:59.427
What could we march on?

14:59.429 --> 15:00.929
How 'bout Washington?

15:00.931 --> 15:02.496
I was just gonna say Washington.

15:03.050 --> 15:04.265
- Yeah.
- Okay, how do we do a march?

15:04.267 --> 15:06.401
There's, like, eight of us,
that's more of a walk.

15:06.403 --> 15:07.986
I wouldn't mind taking a walk.

15:07.988 --> 15:09.237
- Yeah, I like a good walk.
- Yeah.

15:09.239 --> 15:10.321
Right?

15:13.577 --> 15:16.194
Please work, please work, please work.

15:22.119 --> 15:24.252
Kylie, we can't use
our taekwondo moves on

15:24.254 --> 15:25.954
someone else's body, okay?

15:26.383 --> 15:28.590
Leo, I don't care if your
father's a police officer.

15:28.592 --> 15:30.091
This is my jurisdiction.

15:30.093 --> 15:31.509
Your butt smells.

15:31.511 --> 15:33.378
That's not a burn,
it's true of everyone.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.237
I think Glenn's kid is getting hungry.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.381
Do we have any more of that formula?

15:36.383 --> 15:38.349
She doesn't drink formula,
she's still on breast-milk.

15:38.351 --> 15:39.467
I've been pumping
and selling it to Glenn

15:39.469 --> 15:40.635
for a dollar an ounce.

15:40.637 --> 15:42.387
It's Iranian saffron prices.

15:42.389 --> 15:44.055
I guess I could go pump.

15:44.057 --> 15:45.473
What? No. That... that'll take too long.

15:45.475 --> 15:47.108
Just do it right here. No, that's weird.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.444
Come on, go for it. Do it.

15:50.614 --> 15:52.614
All right, hey, listen to me.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.449
You're out of control, okay?

15:54.451 --> 15:56.734
You're a baby,
your life is not that hard.

15:56.736 --> 15:58.037
You're embarrassing yourself.

15:59.814 --> 16:01.706
All right, fine.

16:01.708 --> 16:04.075
It's just that when you
beat up that dog,

16:04.077 --> 16:06.956
it really traumatized those deaf kids.

16:07.380 --> 16:10.415
I will try not to do that again.

16:11.056 --> 16:14.669
Um... can we circle back
to your absences?

16:14.671 --> 16:17.388
Well, I only skip work
because you're always

16:17.390 --> 16:21.226
telling racist jokes
and always making me

16:21.228 --> 16:23.311
sit on your lap during
performance reviews.

16:23.313 --> 16:24.395
Okay.

16:24.397 --> 16:25.763
And I'm not the only one.

16:25.765 --> 16:27.765
Sheila told me that
you're always making her

16:27.767 --> 16:29.350
give you back rubs.

16:29.352 --> 16:33.190
- Right, Sheila?
- Um... yeah.

16:33.323 --> 16:36.241
- Sheila.
- She did the same thing to me.

16:36.243 --> 16:38.576
Then she put her fingers in my mouth.

16:38.921 --> 16:40.278
Look, if we can just make up

16:40.280 --> 16:41.996
whatever we want about everyone,

16:41.998 --> 16:44.616
well, then Sheila,
you put a bomb in your locker.

16:44.618 --> 16:45.884
Boom.

16:45.885 --> 16:49.588
And Terrence, you stole $40 billion

16:49.655 --> 16:51.256
from the cash register.

16:51.258 --> 16:53.291
And Cheyenne, you're going to jail,

16:53.293 --> 16:54.792
because you poisoned the Danishes,

16:54.794 --> 16:56.800
and now Gary's gonna die.

16:56.987 --> 16:59.263
Boo-hoo. You're fired.

17:00.350 --> 17:03.184
What about a fundraiser?
We could do a bake sale.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.769
What would we do with the money?

17:04.771 --> 17:06.771
I guess we pay off the supplies

17:06.772 --> 17:08.806
and then split anything
that was leftover.

17:09.557 --> 17:13.478
So wouldn't that just be
starting a baked goods company?

17:13.961 --> 17:15.696
Okay, how 'bout we do a rally?

17:15.699 --> 17:17.397
Put up some banners,

17:17.400 --> 17:18.700
maybe get a band to play or something?

17:18.702 --> 17:20.094
I know someone at the local news.

17:20.095 --> 17:21.536
I bet they would do a story on it.

17:21.538 --> 17:23.488
No, guys, I say we get some rafts,

17:23.490 --> 17:25.373
and we get some paddles
and we take this guy down

17:25.375 --> 17:26.540
Bay of Pigs style.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.710
You know Bay of Pigs ended badly, right?

17:28.712 --> 17:30.461
For the pigs, maybe.

17:32.967 --> 17:36.630
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Duterte's gotta go.

17:36.757 --> 17:38.011
Hey, hey...

17:38.012 --> 17:40.586
Wow, you guys got the news to show up.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.762
- Doesn't that make you nervous?
- Not really.

17:43.764 --> 17:45.931
I'm just one of those people
that shines through the lens.

17:45.933 --> 17:48.100
If it were me, I'd probably be thinking,

17:48.102 --> 17:50.852
"Sayid, don't criticize
the government on camera,

17:50.854 --> 17:53.271
"because if it doesn't work
and you do get deported,

17:53.273 --> 17:54.906
"you're definitely getting tortured

17:54.908 --> 17:56.308
and murdered over there."

17:57.027 --> 17:59.244
Anyway, I'm gonna go play Pokémon Go.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.196
I hear there's a Snorlax
near the loading dock.

18:02.533 --> 18:03.698
Gotta go.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.034
Hey, hey, ho, ho, Duterte...

18:06.036 --> 18:07.319
When I clean a window, I use Windex.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.206
When I clean the tiles, I use Tilex.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.359
But when I clean the floors...

18:13.360 --> 18:15.010
Oh.

18:22.136 --> 18:24.219
Janet, Sarah.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.724
Oh, um, I think a large bird

18:29.726 --> 18:32.144
may have pooped in
my office wastebasket,

18:32.146 --> 18:34.946
so if someone could clean that up.

18:35.514 --> 18:36.950
He has lost his mind.

18:40.154 --> 18:42.307
That man [bleep] in his office.

18:43.276 --> 18:44.823
All right, everybody, you did it,

18:44.825 --> 18:45.824
give yourselves a hand.

18:47.995 --> 18:50.762
Don't forget on your way out
to pick up a diploma.

18:50.764 --> 18:53.081
There's a blank spot where
you can write in your name.

18:53.083 --> 18:55.667
Or if you really want,
I can try to figure out

18:55.669 --> 18:57.061
how to do it on the printer.

18:58.185 --> 18:59.087
Let's go, come on.

19:02.092 --> 19:05.677
So, I kinda got in my own head today

19:05.679 --> 19:08.180
and probably could have been cooler.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.182
Yeah, you sucked.

19:10.184 --> 19:12.100
For the record, you did imply

19:12.102 --> 19:14.269
I was a pill-popping workplace predator.

19:14.271 --> 19:15.937
I did, that was awesome.

19:15.939 --> 19:17.105
Hey, ladies.

19:17.431 --> 19:19.024
The guys from the embalming seminar

19:19.026 --> 19:20.775
invited us out for drinks.

19:20.777 --> 19:23.143
They said they could show us
the dead bodies.

19:23.947 --> 19:25.280
I mean, I could get a drink.

19:25.282 --> 19:27.032
Dead bodies? Hell yeah.

19:27.034 --> 19:29.549
I haven't been to a dead body
party since high school.

19:29.670 --> 19:30.473
Oh.

19:30.986 --> 19:33.672
The Philippines may be 8,000 miles away,

19:33.674 --> 19:35.207
but that isn't stopping
this protest against

19:35.209 --> 19:37.042
its controversial president.

19:37.357 --> 19:39.794
Mateo Liwanag is leading the rally.

19:39.796 --> 19:42.388
Mateo, tell us,
why do you oppose Duterte?

19:42.799 --> 19:47.219
Um, well, "oppose" is,
uh, kind of a strong word.

19:47.461 --> 19:50.881
Uh, I wouldn't say that we "oppose" him.

19:50.891 --> 19:51.476
Right, right.

19:51.477 --> 19:53.892
Yeah, we're... we're just, uh,
spreading awareness,

19:53.894 --> 19:57.812
uh, and information without judgment.

19:57.814 --> 19:58.901
- What?
- Yes.

19:58.902 --> 20:00.649
So the group you started,

20:00.651 --> 20:02.868
the St. Louis Society Against Duterte,

20:02.870 --> 20:05.237
is not actually against Duterte?

20:05.239 --> 20:07.205
It's a big tent, you know?

20:07.207 --> 20:09.666
Some of us are pro,
some of us are against.

20:09.877 --> 20:11.076
Uh, and some are in the middle.

20:11.078 --> 20:12.410
Yeah, it's complicated, you know?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.894
There's good people on both...
on both sides.

20:14.895 --> 20:15.193
Yeah.

20:15.194 --> 20:17.153
What are you guys talking about?

20:17.154 --> 20:18.334
The guy's a monster.

20:18.335 --> 20:20.697
- No, that's... I don't know...
- I never said "monster."

20:20.698 --> 20:22.921
I mean, that is your opinion.
Yeah, he-he...

20:22.923 --> 20:25.586
Hey, you better watch out, Duterte.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.841
You're a dead man.

20:26.843 --> 20:28.176
When you wake up tomorrow,

20:28.178 --> 20:30.011
you're gonna be in a world of hurt,

20:30.013 --> 20:32.764
'cause this guy right here,
he's a comin' for ya.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.399
Mateo Liwanag.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.101
- And you remember that name...
- Don't...

20:36.103 --> 20:38.103
- Mateo Liwanag.
- That's not my name.

20:38.105 --> 20:39.437
- Ma-te-o.
- And cut.

20:39.439 --> 20:43.208
♪ Arroro mi nino ♪

20:43.210 --> 20:46.711
♪ Arroro mi sol ♪

20:46.713 --> 20:49.424
You like the baby, you like the baby.

20:49.425 --> 20:50.624
I wouldn't say "like."

20:50.625 --> 20:51.753
Hey, guys.

20:52.386 --> 20:54.052
I'm so sorry I'm late.

20:54.054 --> 20:57.305
I... I got stuck,
but I can take Rose back now.

20:58.275 --> 20:59.975
Come on, baby.

20:59.977 --> 21:01.226
Come on.

21:01.228 --> 21:02.055
Oh.

21:02.056 --> 21:04.396
Oh, thank you for watching her.

21:04.774 --> 21:06.815
Daddy had a big day.

21:10.137 --> 21:11.567
You mean this is...

21:12.155 --> 21:13.872
A crime? Yeah.
