WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.843
- You must be one of us.
- One of who?

00:04.040 --> 00:05.041
SAM: <i>One of the psychics.</i>

00:05.200 --> 00:06.564
I mean, there are others
like us out there,

00:06.720 --> 00:08.484
and we're all a part of something.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.125
We both have psychic abilities.

00:13.320 --> 00:14.321
DEAN: <i>Sam, Max is a monster.</i>

00:14.480 --> 00:16.369
He's already killed two people,
now he's gunning for a third.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.647
I think I'm here to help you.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.882
No one can help me.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.282
There are people out there like me.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.363
<i>We all have some kind of ability.</i>

00:24.680 --> 00:27.286
- ELLEN: <i>Ability?
- Yeah. Psychic ability.</i>

00:27.440 --> 00:29.841
These people out there, these psychics,
are they dangerous?

00:30.040 --> 00:31.280
- Not all of them.
- But some are.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.441
Some are very dangerous.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.210
Who knows how many of them
are really out there.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.449
Castiel? After you left Heaven,
when did it start to feel like...

00:37.640 --> 00:39.244
<i>Like you fit? Like you</i>

00:39.440 --> 00:40.487
<i>belonged here?</i>

00:40.760 --> 00:42.091
You do belong here.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.561
It's just gonna take me a second...
To catch up.

00:44.760 --> 00:45.761
<i>I can handle myself.</i>

00:47.400 --> 00:49.243
- You were good at this, weren't you?
- Very.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.130
Mom. What are you trying to say?

00:51.360 --> 00:52.850
I have to go.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.448
I just need a little time.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.651
<i>I love you both.</i>

02:12.440 --> 02:13.601
Olivia?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.970
SAM: <i>Father Valdecantos.</i>

03:20.400 --> 03:23.290
Father Penn of the Dubuque Archdiocese.
This is...

03:23.440 --> 03:24.965
Father De Niro.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.925
We're here to talk about Olivia Sanchez.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.811
I'm not talking about that anymore.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.691
You sure were chatty
with the press and the cops.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.322
"Priest claims demons walk among us."

03:39.480 --> 03:40.811
Boy, that's quite the headline grabber.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.725
- I said I'm not talking about that.
- No, we heard you.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.371
Don't care.

03:46.840 --> 03:51.084
You'll think I'm lying, like my bishop,
like everyone.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.044
But I knew Olivia.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.363
She was a good person.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.888
I watched her get flayed alive
by some invisible force.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.088
That was the devil's work.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.326
I've been told the church doesn't want us
talking like that anymore,

04:04.480 --> 04:06.881
too old-fashioned, but I know what I saw.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.485
You see any black smoke?

04:09.320 --> 04:11.527
- What?
- We don't think you're lying.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.842
We just want to ask you a few questions,
that's all.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.921
Um... No. No smoke.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.685
What about sulfur?
Did you smell rotten eggs?

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
No.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.122
You told people
that she was speaking in tongues?

04:24.320 --> 04:26.368
Yes. It sounded like Hebrew.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.526
- Sounds more like Aramaic than Hebrew.
- Hmm.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.208
What kind of priests are you?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.044
The old-fashioned kind.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.886
Thanks.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.489
So, no sulfur means no demon.
You think the padre's right?

04:47.680 --> 04:49.205
Talking about Lucifer here?

04:49.440 --> 04:52.967
Small time for him.
I don't know, maybe a rogue angel?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.081
Dean?

05:01.120 --> 05:03.248
Yeah, uh, I'll make the call.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.731
DEAN: <i>Wait, Wait, Wait. What?</i>

05:05.080 --> 05:06.525
Are you serious?

05:06.800 --> 05:10.009
Yes, Cass, it's weird.
It's really, really weird.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.603
All right, yeah, uh,
thanks for the heads up.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.048
I'm a 13-year-old girl.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.408
Hey, so what's the word?

05:38.640 --> 05:39.721
Cass have anything?

05:39.880 --> 05:42.531
Yeah, uh...
I have good news.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.808
There's nothing on angel radio,
and Heaven's still on lockdown,

05:46.000 --> 05:47.411
so rogue angel is out.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.886
Bad news?

05:49.840 --> 05:51.649
Cass is chumming it up with Crowley.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.922
They're hunting Lucifer. Together.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.401
That's right,
one's an angel, one's a demon,

05:56.560 --> 05:58.403
and, apparently, they solve crimes.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.289
Are they having any luck?

06:00.440 --> 06:04.923
Yeah, kind of. So, Lucifer,
The Lord of Evil, Angel of Light,

06:05.080 --> 06:07.367
is now the Master of Butt Rock.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.404
He jumped into Vince Vincente.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.688
- The rock star?
- The douchebag.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.721
Guy used to roll with purple hair down
to his butt, and a spiked codpiece.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.883
- It was the '80s.
- The what?

06:20.440 --> 06:21.885
It was the '80s.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.367
- What, you're defending him?
- No. I'm not.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.326
I mean, his third album was kind of
not horrible.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.641
I hate you so much right now.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.404
Anyway, he's the devil now?

06:31.560 --> 06:33.801
Well, he was always kind of the devil,
but, yeah, now it's official.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.400
Where is he?

06:35.680 --> 06:37.682
Rowena blasted him
to the bottom of the ocean.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.967
- Why?
- I don't know.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.805
- Why do you love Vince Vincente?
- I don't love...

06:42.160 --> 06:46.210
Anyways, I looked up those words.
I was right, they are Aramaic.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.084
Means "Save me, oh, God."

06:52.320 --> 06:53.526
Save me from what?

07:02.320 --> 07:04.687
Body's right there, agents.
I can get her prepped...

07:04.840 --> 07:07.161
That's great, Carl.
We'll take it from here.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.089
Oh. Okay. Um...

07:09.320 --> 07:11.049
But it's a weird one.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.770
- If you guys need anything at all...
- We won't. We won't, thank you.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.241
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
DEAN: <i>Yep.</i>

07:16.520 --> 07:17.601
Okay.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.682
Little, uh, tough on Carl,
don't you think?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.967
He's a big boy, he can take it.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.247
You okay?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.045
- Peachy.
- <i>You sure?</i>

07:35.200 --> 07:37.806
'Cause ever since Mom left,
you've been a little, uh...

07:38.040 --> 07:39.610
- Cranky.
- Cranky, huh?

07:39.880 --> 07:42.963
Yeah. I mean, to the priest, to Carl.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.009
Heck, on the way here,
you wouldn't even make a pit stop.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.449
So, now, your tiny bladder is my problem?

07:47.600 --> 07:49.329
- I'm just saying...
- Olivia Sanchez.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.244
Her body was found
to have deep cuts on her back

07:51.400 --> 07:52.686
as though she'd been whipped.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.121
Holes punctured
through her hands and her feet,

07:55.320 --> 07:57.482
and pinprick wounds
around the top of her skull.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.563
What's that sound like to you?

08:00.880 --> 08:02.041
Stigmata.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.401
Bingo.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.730
- Gets weirder.
- How?

08:10.120 --> 08:13.681
"The victim's skull
was filled with a goopy mush."

08:14.280 --> 08:15.930
That Carl paints quite a picture,
doesn't he?

08:17.800 --> 08:20.451
All right, what can do all that?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.241
- I've got nothing.
- Me neither.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.289
Well, maybe we should focus more on
the case, and less on the Dr. Phil crap?

08:37.240 --> 08:38.890
It's just over here.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.929
This is... Was Olivia's office.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.727
So, what is it now?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.806
It's, kind of, mine now.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.811
So, is that yours?

08:57.320 --> 08:59.209
It's for positive energy.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.085
I'm a Wiccan.

09:02.720 --> 09:03.801
Cool.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.010
So, how well did you know Olivia?

09:07.240 --> 09:08.685
She was my boss.

09:09.640 --> 09:14.965
Is it true what they're saying?
That she, you know, killed herself?

09:15.480 --> 09:18.324
Well, we're working on that. Um...

09:18.680 --> 09:21.160
Now, the day she died,
was Olivia acting strange?

09:21.360 --> 09:23.328
Not really. I mean...

09:24.160 --> 09:27.004
She was getting headaches, bad ones,
like super-migraines,

09:27.160 --> 09:29.367
but we all knew she was working too hard.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.650
She have any enemies?

09:32.080 --> 09:35.163
Somebody who held a grudge?
Maybe wanted to do her harm?

09:35.520 --> 09:37.090
Yeah.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.882
I mean, Olivia was great,
but this is Child Protective Services.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.690
We get threats all the time.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.360
- From who?
- Everyone. You don't make a lot of friends

09:47.560 --> 09:50.450
when sometimes, what's best for a family
is to split them up.

09:50.640 --> 09:51.801
SAM: <i>Right. Um...</i>

09:52.040 --> 09:53.963
Yeah, can we see Olivia's case files?

09:54.120 --> 09:55.167
Of course, they're right over here.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.531
Well, that was easy.

10:01.720 --> 10:02.846
What?

10:03.160 --> 10:05.640
"What?" The Wicca'd Witch of the West
in there.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.724
Ms. Positive Energy
wanted the bigger office,

10:08.920 --> 10:10.649
did a little hoodoo... Boom.

10:11.680 --> 10:15.571
I say we put a witch killing
cap in her ass, call it a day.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.048
Yeah, but we checked the church
and Olivia's house.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.166
We didn't exactly find any hexbags.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.890
So, she covered her tracks.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.883
Oh, we're not looking at a witch.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.886
I'm not saying it's not Beth,
I'm just saying we need proof.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.889
And look, if it's her,
I'll shoot her myself.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.647
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm definitely shooting her.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.966
Coroner says signs of stigmata
with a side of scrambled brains,

11:46.120 --> 11:47.645
just like Olivia. Find anything?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.882
Maybe. Kid delivered groceries
all over town.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.122
So I checked his route
against Olivia's case files.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.964
- And?
- Got a match.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.806
DEAN: <i>Tell us about the Petersons.</i>

11:56.000 --> 11:57.365
They're weird.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.325
- How weird?
- All the way. That family, they're like,

12:00.520 --> 12:02.921
off-the-charts religious.
Old, Old Testament.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.448
I'm talking no cars, no electricity,
no nothing.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.208
Kids are home-schooled. Family like that,
we try to keep an eye on them, but...

12:12.640 --> 12:14.085
But what, Beth?

12:14.320 --> 12:15.970
<i>Their oldest, Magda,</i>

12:16.160 --> 12:17.650
few years ago, she got pneumonia,

12:17.840 --> 12:19.808
and the family
wouldn't let a doctor treat her.

12:19.960 --> 12:23.248
They said whatever
happened was God's will.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.731
What happened?

12:24.960 --> 12:26.246
<i>She died.</i>

12:29.040 --> 12:31.008
All right. Um, thank you.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.761
So?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.288
Weird, creepy, off-the-grid,
Children of the Corn people?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.170
Yeah, I'm in.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.767
Guess we're walking from here.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.329
Well, when they cut the cord,
they really cut the cord.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.891
Yeah, no kidding.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.481
How fast you think their buggy goes?
Like, top speed.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.563
Hey, about yesterday...

13:34.720 --> 13:37.291
Oh, all right, next time
you got to take a leak, I'll pull over.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.081
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about you and Mom.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.241
What about her?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.243
What? She took some cash,
a cellphone she doesn't answer,

13:44.400 --> 13:45.401
and she bailed on us.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.643
I mean, think about what
she's going through, after everything.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.325
She probably just needs some space.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.926
We've been there. We've both had times
where we needed time apart.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.081
We both came back.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.208
- You don't think she's going to?
- I don't know.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.926
She hates the way we were raised,
she hates the fact that we're hunters.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.889
Maybe she starts walking
and she doesn't stop.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.562
You know, she obviously has zero interest
in keeping this family together.

14:04.840 --> 14:08.287
Well, you know, sometimes, families
do better after a little time apart.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.643
Yeah, who? The Mansons?

14:16.600 --> 14:17.601
Can I help you?

14:17.760 --> 14:21.287
Abraham Peterson? I'm James Morrison,
this is my associate, Ray Manzarek.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.171
We're your new case workers
with Child Protective Services.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.407
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.446
Thought you'd be, uh, you know,
a long beard, suspenders, big hat.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.891
We're not that kind of religious.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.521
Ah.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.405
SAM: <i>Mr. and Mrs. Peterson,</i>

14:40.640 --> 14:44.167
we're here because your previous
case worker, Olivia Sanchez,

14:44.480 --> 14:46.050
has passed away.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.131
What happened?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.169
We're not sure yet.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.091
Now, how often did she visit?

15:00.320 --> 15:01.651
Every few months.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.403
We liked her better
than the other one, that Beth.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.770
What was wrong with Beth?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.401
She hated us because of our faith.

15:12.240 --> 15:17.087
Olivia Sanchez was a papist,
but at least she believed in God.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.165
Do you know God, gentlemen?

15:21.480 --> 15:25.371
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're besties.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.447
ABRAHAM: <i>Oh, okay.</i>

15:32.840 --> 15:35.446
Um, I'm a little embarrassed to ask,

15:35.600 --> 15:38.843
but you think one of you boys
might help me with something?

16:11.240 --> 16:14.210
DEAN: What happens when, uh,
stuff like this goes wrong

16:14.360 --> 16:15.407
and no one's around to help you?

16:15.560 --> 16:16.721
Pray harder.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.406
See, I'm not good with all this.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.211
I was a computer programmer
till about five years ago.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.930
What made you move
out to the middle of nowhere?

16:24.280 --> 16:26.806
Oh... The world out there,

16:27.120 --> 16:28.804
it's all distractions,

16:29.040 --> 16:31.088
consumerism, corporations.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.126
And the people, if they're not shopping
or stuffing their face,

16:35.320 --> 16:37.288
they're sitting in front of some screen,

16:37.480 --> 16:39.721
watching fake people do fake things,

16:39.880 --> 16:43.043
while the real world
just gets more and more screwed up.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.005
Gail and I,
we didn't want that for our kids,

16:46.400 --> 16:47.606
so here we are.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.763
Sweating our butts off.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.764
The things you do for family.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.246
Hmm.

16:54.760 --> 16:55.761
It's ready.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.844
ABRAHAM: All right,
let's get this wheel on.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.447
On three. One, two, three...

17:03.880 --> 17:05.450
Good.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.248
We're out of coffee,
hope lemonade's all right.

17:19.480 --> 17:20.766
Oh, yeah, great, thank you.

17:20.960 --> 17:21.961
Welcome.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.646
- Happy family.
- No, they weren't.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.683
The father was working 80 hours a week
to barely pay the mortgage,

17:33.840 --> 17:37.322
and what little time he did spend at home,
he spent in a bottle.

17:37.480 --> 17:41.121
Children were on four different kinds
of behavior-enhancing medication,

17:41.280 --> 17:42.884
and barely spoke.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.244
Could text up a storm though.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.960
And the mother, she was the worst.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.445
She was so pill'd up,
she could barely think straight.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.284
So, what happened?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.447
God showed them a better way.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.720
I was in a car accident. Almost died.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.561
Nerves in the lower half of my body
are damaged.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.847
I saw doctors,
no one could stop the pain.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.529
Best they could do was give me drugs,
which helped for a while.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.522
But the more I took,
the more I needed,

18:20.680 --> 18:22.842
and when I didn't get them...

18:26.400 --> 18:29.688
And then, one night,
when things were at their worst,

18:29.840 --> 18:33.322
I was lying in a puddle of my own sick,

18:33.800 --> 18:35.370
I heard a voice.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.844
It was God's voice.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.689
<i>"And he said," Go, live a life
of simplicity and humility,</i>

18:42.840 --> 18:45.571
"and all your pain will be taken away."

18:45.760 --> 18:48.127
So, has the pain gone away?

18:49.560 --> 18:51.961
I get by, with His grace.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.043
Mrs. Peterson, um,

18:57.440 --> 19:00.364
what can you tell me about Ricky Copeland?

19:01.720 --> 19:03.722
- The delivery boy?
- Yeah.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.805
Comes by once a week,
brings us things we can't grow ourselves.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.047
Why?

19:12.200 --> 19:13.440
Well...

19:14.920 --> 19:16.410
He's dead, too.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.771
I see.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.361
You see?

19:28.240 --> 19:29.241
That's it?

19:29.760 --> 19:31.762
God has a plan for us all.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.607
So, what happened to your daughter,
was that God's plan?

19:40.680 --> 19:41.886
Yes.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.603
She didn't have to die.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.245
She was sick.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.443
- If you had taken her to a doctor...
- God does...

19:52.600 --> 19:54.967
God doesn't care
what kind of life you live.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.201
Trust me.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.444
And God didn't kill your daughter,
you did.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.651
ABRAHAM: <i>I think you boys should go.</i>

20:20.520 --> 20:23.649
All right, we clear
on what we got to do, right?

20:24.160 --> 20:26.527
- Yeah, definitely.
- What's that for?

20:26.760 --> 20:30.321
- To track down Magda's ghost. What's...
- Beth, the witch.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.165
- Dean, this isn't a witch.
- It's not a ghost.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.129
Those people let their daughter die.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.930
She's angry, and wants revenge.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.163
Yeah, but they're alive. Besides,
how'd she get around town, huh?

20:40.320 --> 20:43.130
- Ghosts are tied to one place.
- Or to a person, or to a thing.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.810
- You're reaching here.
- And you're not?

20:44.960 --> 20:46.644
Beth didn't even know the delivery boy.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.484
Maybe, maybe not. But I'm gonna find out.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.927
Look, you didn't spend alone time
with that woman, she is disturbed.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.043
The family's weird,
but they're good people.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.006
Beth wanted the better job,
she killed to get it. End of story.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.441
- You're wrong.
- Look, you got your ideas, I got mine.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.126
You wanna stay here and scan the farm
for EMF, you go right ahead.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.441
I'm on Beth.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.331
- Fine, we'll see who's right.
- Well, we'll see I'm right.

You killed them.

I have tried

But you let him out.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.810
You couldn't let it rest. And now...

23:37.280 --> 23:40.090
Now the devil is doing his work
through you.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.924
Confess your sins.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.406
What's wrong?

25:15.560 --> 25:17.164
Mom's with Magda.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.761
Your mother's doing God's work.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.931
She's hurting her.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.566
Son, the devil's a deceiver.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.764
Don't let him sow doubt in you.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.841
If anyone found out about Magda,
they'd come for her.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.810
And if that happened...

25:44.480 --> 25:46.209
<i>I love your sister,</i>

25:49.640 --> 25:51.483
but you know what she can do.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.326
Magda...

25:57.600 --> 25:59.602
Magda's our cross to bear.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.041
SAM: Come on.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.085
DEAN: Working late?

26:32.520 --> 26:35.683
Oh. Sorry, agent, you surprised me.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.451
No worries.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.525
Can I help you?

26:45.560 --> 26:47.847
How are you liking the new gig?

26:52.280 --> 26:53.441
I hate it.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.046
What?

26:58.320 --> 27:01.210
Yeah, you make more, but you work more.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.366
And if somebody screws up, that's on you.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.131
If somebody blows a deadline,
that's on you.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.240
<i>And if somebody's
photocopying their ass in the break room,</i>

27:10.440 --> 27:14.764
you have to adult, and act all mad,
even though it's kind of hilarious.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.327
Being the boss sucks.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.887
I don't know how Olivia did it.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.322
But I thought you wanted this job.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.727
No. Nobody wants this job.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.127
Oh.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.971
So, why are you here?

27:35.920 --> 27:37.365
Um...

27:56.520 --> 27:57.521
GAIL: Again.

27:57.680 --> 27:58.761
Again.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.487
- Hey.
- DEAN: <i>Beth is not a witch.</i>

28:19.800 --> 28:21.290
You were right about
the whole ghost thing.

28:21.440 --> 28:24.046
Listen, Magda is still alive.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.287
Wait, what?

28:25.480 --> 28:28.086
Yes, Magda's not dead, she's alive.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.806
Sam.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.646
Don't move.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.647
- Sammy.
- SAM: <i>Okay, listen to me.</i>

28:40.280 --> 28:42.567
I can help your sister, okay?

28:43.080 --> 28:45.321
I just need you to trust me here.

That's not my name.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.490
I'm not Magda, I'm the devil.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.688
No, no, you're not. You're really not.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.451
He's inside me.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.204
<i>I can hear him whispering.</i>

29:54.840 --> 29:57.650
He lets me hear what people are thinking.

He lets me do things.

What kind of things?

30:08.960 --> 30:10.644
<i>Magda, I'm here...</i>

30:11.520 --> 30:13.329
<i>I'm here to help you.</i>

30:14.440 --> 30:15.726
Show me.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.721
Please.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.400
They'll come for us, our children.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.922
We need to leave tonight.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.966
SAM: Magda...

31:00.400 --> 31:03.404
You're not the devil. You're just psychic.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.650
There are others out there like you,
like me.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.124
I had powers, too.

31:09.280 --> 31:14.286
I'd get these visions sometimes,
and I could move things with my mind.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.290
You can do that?

31:18.600 --> 31:20.443
Well, no, not anymore, I don't think.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.125
But that didn't make me the devil.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.487
It just made me who I am.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.050
Then you were evil.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.364
Mother says I'm evil

31:33.560 --> 31:35.449
because I hurt people.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.004
Who did you hurt?

31:39.240 --> 31:40.651
<i>I didn't mean it.</i>

31:41.400 --> 31:44.927
She was pretty, and she always smiled,

31:47.040 --> 31:49.122
and I thought that maybe
she could help me.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.568
MAGDA: <i>I couldn't talk to her,
I could hear her thoughts,</i>

32:00.000 --> 32:02.241
and I thought maybe
I could make her hear mine.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.365
<i>So, I prayed.</i>

32:15.680 --> 32:17.682
And I reached out to her.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.001
<i>But she never came.</i>

32:23.200 --> 32:26.044
Then I did it again with the delivery boy.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.208
Mother says I killed them.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.527
Magda, that wasn't your fault.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.847
You are not the devil, you're not evil.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.726
<i>And it's scary, I know it's scary.</i>

32:43.440 --> 32:45.761
<i>But you can learn how to control it.</i>

32:46.040 --> 32:49.203
You don't ever have to hurt anyone,
ever again.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.923
It's time for supper.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.245
Who's hungry?

33:18.400 --> 33:19.765
Abraham...

33:21.440 --> 33:23.249
Your daughter needs help.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.801
What do you think
we've been doing all these years?

33:26.600 --> 33:29.206
You talk about knowing God,
well, we know the devil.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.331
We've been wrestling with her for years.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.570
You have any idea what she's done?

33:35.800 --> 33:39.407
Those people, that wasn't her fault.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.285
<i>You think they're the first?</i>

33:42.520 --> 33:43.521
Tell him.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.480
Tell him.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.249
Before we came here,

33:55.040 --> 33:57.122
I wanted a new cell phone,

33:57.720 --> 33:59.529
but my mom wouldn't buy me one.

33:59.800 --> 34:03.407
We were driving home,
and she screamed at me to pull over,

34:04.760 --> 34:07.127
and I felt the devil at my hands.

34:08.639 --> 34:11.371
I yanked that wheel
right into oncoming traffic.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.364
<i>She did this to me.</i>

34:15.120 --> 34:16.884
She did this to us.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.324
She has taken lives.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.523
Don't you understand
that by keeping her here,

34:21.679 --> 34:22.806
we're protecting you.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.167
By doing what?
Beating the hell out of her?

34:25.320 --> 34:27.527
Pain purges sin.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.291
No, it doesn't. You're wrong.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.481
Abraham.

34:35.800 --> 34:36.801
It's time.

34:44.719 --> 34:46.848
We thank you for these bountiful gifts.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.929
May they nourish our body and soul.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.120
And look after each one of us,
now and unto our dying day.

34:54.679 --> 34:56.170
- Amen.
- Amen.

35:02.760 --> 35:03.921
Mmm.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.524
Dig in, everyone.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.520
Elijah.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.321
Dad.

35:21.640 --> 35:22.880
Abraham.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.042
- Dad.
- Shh.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.406
SAM: What did you do?

35:37.400 --> 35:38.447
Eat.

35:39.320 --> 35:40.685
What did you do?

35:40.880 --> 35:42.564
This is how we will stay together.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.247
We will enter Heaven as a family.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.726
Eat!

35:50.000 --> 35:51.365
Elijah, do not eat that.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.241
<i>Elijah!</i>

35:57.440 --> 35:58.930
- Mom?
- Eat

35:59.760 --> 36:01.842
Elijah, do not do it.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.241
GAIL: Eat!

36:09.320 --> 36:10.651
No!

36:13.080 --> 36:14.241
Devil.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.089
No!

36:30.920 --> 36:33.651
I'm not the devil, you are.

36:47.960 --> 36:50.088
Magda. Stop. You don't have to do this!

36:50.240 --> 36:51.446
<i>You can control it.</i>

36:51.640 --> 36:53.290
<i>Magda, nobody else has to die.</i>

36:53.800 --> 36:54.961
Please!

37:26.120 --> 37:27.645
She's the devil.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.008
The devil is among us!

37:32.640 --> 37:34.483
She must be cleansed!

37:35.560 --> 37:36.766
<i>She is the devil!</i>

37:38.000 --> 37:39.445
Pray for us.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.528
Sorry I missed all the psycho.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.525
And you thought our family was crazy.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.681
Hey, Magda.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.686
Are you holding up?

38:06.520 --> 38:08.966
Beth called my aunt in California.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.410
I'm gonna be staying with her.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.610
She has a ranch.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.763
Lots of wide open country.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.286
DEAN: <i>Well, that's great.</i>

38:19.520 --> 38:22.729
You know, sometimes, in order to
figure things out, a person needs space.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.085
Agent, can I talk to you?

38:29.720 --> 38:31.210
Yeah, sure.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.086
Magda, I know it doesn't feel like it
right now, but...

38:45.320 --> 38:46.890
You're gonna be all right.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.121
You can do this.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.010
<i>You will do this.</i>

38:51.400 --> 38:54.404
Just remember, that power,

38:55.320 --> 38:57.322
it doesn't control you.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.245
You control it.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.571
I know.

39:06.280 --> 39:09.045
<i>If you ever need anything, anything,</i>

39:09.800 --> 39:12.201
call me, okay? I'll be there.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.604
Think you made the right call back there
letting her go?

39:20.800 --> 39:21.881
I hope so.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.963
I mean,
Magda didn't know what she was doing,

39:24.120 --> 39:25.121
she had no idea.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.442
I think she deserves a second chance.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.444
What did Beth want?

39:29.800 --> 39:32.451
She gave me her number.
Her personal number.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.127
- You were gonna shoot her.
- Yeah, I know, kind of weird.

39:35.320 --> 39:37.163
Kind of hot.

39:37.680 --> 39:41.844
Hey, um, did you mean
what you said back there?

39:45.120 --> 39:46.326
Yeah, you were right.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.405
This whole Mom thing, it's...

39:49.600 --> 39:52.001
I mean, we get her back,
and then she leaves.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.607
I hate it, but I get it. I do.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.450
I guess I just... I'm still working
through some of that crap,

39:58.640 --> 40:00.085
so I'll try to be less of a dick about it.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.241
Deal.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.205
- What?
- Nothing.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.522
All right, bathrooms to the right,
soda machines to the left.

40:39.680 --> 40:43.082
You have 20 minutes, folks,
and we're off to Cali.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.241
MAN: <i>What's your status?</i>

41:47.440 --> 41:49.283
I cleaned up the Winchesters' mess.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.847
As suspected,
they couldn't finish the job.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.327
<i>Very well, thank you Mr. Ketch.</i>
