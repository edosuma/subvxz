33:23.305 --> 33:24.393
Ugh, this computer sucks.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.047
I'm gonna go use
the one at work.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.180
Where are you?I'm right here.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.707
COMPUTER VOICE: GPS call
trackers can be used to track

33:33.750 --> 33:36.188
a location of the phone.
You can also...Murphy.

33:36.231 --> 33:37.450
What?

33:37.493 --> 33:38.842
There's a cop here to see you,

33:38.886 --> 33:40.018
because of course there is.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.541
Really?

33:41.584 --> 33:43.369
And congratulations
on the promotion, by the way.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.197
It's nice to see
that there is zero nepotism

33:45.240 --> 33:46.720
at this company.
Okay.

33:46.763 --> 33:48.069
Um, hey, uh, Murphy,
it's me, Dean.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.418
We met the other day.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.985
Is this about Tyson?

33:51.029 --> 33:53.074
Oh, uh, no, sorry.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.685
Uh, I actually am here
with my daughter, Chloe.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.470
Chloe, this is Murphy.
Hi.

33:57.513 --> 33:58.558
Hi.

33:58.601 --> 34:00.647
Um, we were here
to look into

34:00.690 --> 34:02.388
possibly getting
a guide dog.

34:02.431 --> 34:04.738
Uh, that-that's my parents.
Their office is...

34:04.781 --> 34:06.261
Yep. I can show you
the way, actually.

34:06.305 --> 34:07.610
It's just right
over here, yeah.Oh.

34:07.654 --> 34:08.785
Sh-Should she come...No, no, no.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.091
There's a chair
right there.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.353
Come on, follow me.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.094
Here, right here. There you go.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.662
I will be right back.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.794
You guys can
get to know each other.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.796
Maybe you have
some things in common.

34:19.840 --> 34:23.539
What could we possibly
have in common?

34:23.583 --> 34:25.976
My dad is such
a dork sometimes.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.283
[laughs]And that guy

34:28.327 --> 34:29.589
just said,
"There's a chair right there,"

34:29.632 --> 34:31.678
as if I have any idea
where "right there" is.

34:31.721 --> 34:32.983
I know.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.725
That's Felix.
He's such a loser.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.336
He always says
stuff like that to me.

34:37.379 --> 34:39.947
So you're gonna
get a guide dog?

34:39.990 --> 34:42.123
Yeah, I'm kind of a loner.

34:42.167 --> 34:45.126
My dad thinks I need a friend.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.694
I'm kind of a loner, too.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.870
Most cool people are.

34:51.393 --> 34:54.048
You think I'm cool?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.615
I know you are.

34:57.704 --> 34:58.748
[chuckles]

34:58.792 --> 35:01.838
Thanks for talking to her.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.666
She's a really
sweet kid.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.192
Hey, um,
I wanted to ask,

35:07.235 --> 35:09.803
if it's okay,
just when your...

35:09.846 --> 35:12.632
how you lost
your, uh...

35:12.675 --> 35:15.809
Virginity? Um, it was
my 17th birthday.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.159
I had had a few too many
wine coolers...

35:18.203 --> 35:20.074
Yeah, that was not
what I was asking.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.642
Um, I have
retinitis pigmentosa,

35:22.685 --> 35:26.341
so I lost my vision
completely when I was 14.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.648
Whoa.
Yeah.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.171
I'm so sorry.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.738
Tell me you don't
do that to Chloe.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.654
What?The pitying thing.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.656
I'm not pitying you.No, your voice went down

35:36.699 --> 35:39.224
like three pitying octaves.
"I'm so sorry."

35:39.267 --> 35:42.705
Okay. All right. Sorry.

35:42.749 --> 35:46.709
Look, treat her
like any other kid.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.669
Get mad at her
and force her to do chores,

35:49.712 --> 35:52.193
stuff like that.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.674
Yeah, that's all I would have
wanted from my parents

35:54.717 --> 35:56.284
when I lost my sight.

35:56.328 --> 36:00.723
That's, um, maybe the best
advice anyone's given me.

36:00.767 --> 36:01.855
[chuckles]

36:04.205 --> 36:06.642
So have you heard anything
about my friend Tyson?

36:06.686 --> 36:10.472
Well... I'm sorry,
there wasn't a body.

36:10.516 --> 36:11.952
Yeah, somebody
obviously moved it.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.214
Can you track a phone?

36:13.258 --> 36:16.870
Murphy, I-I want to help you,

36:16.913 --> 36:19.612
but until there's some evidence

36:19.655 --> 36:21.222
that something happened
to this kid,

36:21.266 --> 36:25.357
then there's nothing
any of us can do.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.923
Yeah.

36:28.011 --> 36:29.448
Fine.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.232
JESS:
Ugh, this is insane.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.843
Is there anyone
working here?

36:33.887 --> 36:37.020
3:00, guy, nerdy.

36:37.064 --> 36:39.980
Okay, watch me. I'm gonna
wrap him around my finger, okay?

36:40.023 --> 36:41.503
[clears throat]Okay.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.770
[bumps desk]

36:47.814 --> 36:50.860
Hi. What can I do for you?Uh...

36:50.904 --> 36:55.909
I-I lost my phone, and, uh...
I can't find it because I'm...

36:55.952 --> 36:57.432
I'm actually blind.

36:57.476 --> 36:59.478
Uh, so I was wondering maybe
you could track it

36:59.521 --> 37:01.306
and help me figure out
where I lost it.

37:01.349 --> 37:03.960
Oh, I'm not supposed to do that.

37:04.004 --> 37:05.440
I'll let you buy me a drink.

37:05.484 --> 37:09.227
That's very nice of you,
but I don't drink.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.229
I'm-I'm only 19 years old.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.579
Okay, I'll give you,
like, 20 bucks.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.409
Okay, what's the number?

37:25.243 --> 37:27.245
Your name is Tyson Parker?

37:27.288 --> 37:30.204
Her dad loves
Mike Tyson,

37:30.248 --> 37:33.425
but before all the assaults
and ear-biting stuff.

37:33.468 --> 37:35.296
You guys know I could
get fired for this, right?

37:35.340 --> 37:36.863
Yeah, but, do you,
like, really care

37:36.906 --> 37:38.952
if you get fired
from this job?

37:38.995 --> 37:40.519
I'm not gonna
tell anyone.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.651
Okay.

37:42.695 --> 37:46.394
It's at 115th Street and King,
but it's not on the main street.

37:46.438 --> 37:47.961
It's near
the underpass.

37:48.004 --> 37:49.745
So it's-it's not in Madison?

37:49.789 --> 37:53.009
No.Uh, 115th and King?

37:53.053 --> 37:54.881
Got it. Thank you.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.839
Wait, where's my 20 bucks?

37:56.883 --> 37:59.015
JESS:
This is how we die.
This is how we die.

37:59.059 --> 38:02.280
MURPHY:
Shut up, Jess. We're not
gonna die. Just park, please.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.847
Come on. Come on.

38:12.377 --> 38:13.987
Okay, watch
your step.

38:21.168 --> 38:23.518
[cars passing overhead][gasps]

38:23.562 --> 38:24.911
Okay, are-are we
gonna find, like,

38:24.954 --> 38:25.955
a dead body
or something, Murphy?

38:25.999 --> 38:27.348
Because I'm not
prepared for that.

38:27.392 --> 38:28.915
I know, technically,
that I'm a doctor,

38:28.958 --> 38:30.264
but let's be honest,
I'm a vet.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.048
Just stop talking.Okay, sorry.

38:35.008 --> 38:35.965
[phone chimes]

38:36.009 --> 38:38.011
Call Tyson.

38:38.054 --> 38:40.143
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Calling Tyson.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.322
[phone ringing, buzzing]

38:51.372 --> 38:53.505
MURPHY:
Thanks for meeting me.

38:53.548 --> 38:57.204
Uh, you should know I've been
a lot nicer to my dog.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.556
See?

39:01.600 --> 39:03.819
Is that why you called me here?
Talk about your dog?

39:04.907 --> 39:07.693
So, someone was texting us
from Tyson's phone.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.085
Okay, I'm out.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.174
Look.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.046
I found this
last night.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.917
This phone was never in Madison.

39:14.961 --> 39:18.791
Wait, hold up.
His phone was never in Madison?

39:20.401 --> 39:23.361
Someone killed your cousin,
Darnell.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.928
And whoever it is, they are
really trying to cover it up.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.889
We have to go
to the police.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.674
Stay away from cops.

39:32.718 --> 39:34.546
Let me handle this, all right?

39:34.589 --> 39:37.766
All right?

39:37.810 --> 39:39.594
Okay.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.215
Where did you
get this?

39:52.259 --> 39:54.217
I have my ways.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.481
So?

39:56.524 --> 39:58.091
I'll, um, give it to Forensics,

39:58.134 --> 39:59.875
see if we can get anything
from the cloud.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.399
Thank you.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.618
Seriously, though,
how-how'd you find it?

40:08.231 --> 40:11.191
Uh, by the way,
took your advice.

40:11.234 --> 40:13.454
Gonna take Chloe to a Cubs game.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.935
I know she can't
see it, but, uh,

40:15.978 --> 40:18.154
I used to take her
all the time.

40:18.198 --> 40:20.243
I'm sure she's gonna love that.

40:21.767 --> 40:24.900
Listen, I know Tyson
meant a lot to you.

40:24.944 --> 40:28.382
I'll keep an eye out and see
if anything links back to him.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.818
If he really is dead...

40:29.862 --> 40:33.039
He is....or if he ran away,

40:33.082 --> 40:35.737
second I know anything,
I'll make sure I'm on the case.

40:35.781 --> 40:37.347
I know you're just
trying to be nice,

40:37.391 --> 40:38.914
but you're basically telling me
you're gonna wait

40:38.958 --> 40:41.351
and see what happens.

40:41.395 --> 40:42.657
[sighs]

40:44.746 --> 40:46.792
[sighs heavily]

40:58.673 --> 41:00.719
You want one?

41:07.377 --> 41:08.814
JESS:
Hey.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.468
Jess?

41:10.511 --> 41:12.121
How'd you know where to find me?

41:12.165 --> 41:13.732
It's not that hard.

41:13.775 --> 41:15.734
You go to the same
three places.

41:15.777 --> 41:16.952
It's true.

41:21.740 --> 41:25.744
Murph, I really think
you should get some rest.

41:25.787 --> 41:29.748
I can't just sit around
and do nothing.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.750
I have to find out
what happened to him.

41:31.793 --> 41:33.055
I know.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.362
You're gonna figure it out.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.409
You are the most stubborn
person I know,

41:39.453 --> 41:42.325
and in this case,
that's a good thing.

41:42.369 --> 41:45.198
Come on, it's freezing.
Let's get out of here.
