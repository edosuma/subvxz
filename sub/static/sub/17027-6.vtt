00:01.669 --> 00:05.139
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:05.173 --> 00:08.442
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.444
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.478 --> 00:11.912
and by the time I got here,

00:11.945 --> 00:16.184
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.886
I hid who I really was

00:18.919 --> 00:23.157
until one day,
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.194
To most people,
I'm a reporter
at Catco Worldwide Media.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.763
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.797 --> 00:31.665
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.699 --> 00:34.335
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.306
I am Supergirl.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.774
Previously on Supergirl...

00:40.808 --> 00:42.843
I want to do something good
for the world.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.145
You can make me a suit.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.146
I will help you.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.348
-I didn't know you were
into girls.
-I'm not.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.453
There's some truth
to what you said.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.854
ALEX: You were fired.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.423
So, does this mean
I don't need to get a job?

00:55.456 --> 00:57.225
-You still need to get a job.
-Right.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.527
I'm a member
of an organization
called Cadmus.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.667
Dr. Jones, there's something
you need to see.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.237
Has the permafrost thawing
accelerated?

01:09.270 --> 01:12.840
It's already melting
at a rate that'll put Helsinki
underwater in the next decade.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.609
Sir, we...
We don't know what this is.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.616
DR. JONES: A frozen wolf?

01:22.650 --> 01:26.254
We found a stone spearhead
in the body.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.821
It dates to around 3000 BC.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.891
So, Bronze Age Vikings
visited Svalbard.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.059
I mean...

01:32.092 --> 01:34.562
We're studying climate change,
not archeology, doctor.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.729
Touch it.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.736
This wolf has been
trapped in the ice
for over 5,000 years.

01:42.770 --> 01:43.771
Okay.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.780
It's not possible.
It's still warm.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.783
One hour out of the ice,

01:55.816 --> 01:57.318
the tissue is soft,

01:58.486 --> 02:00.521
and at a normal
body temperature.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.864
WOMAN: What the hell survives
5,000 years under ice?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.202
You mean, besides a disease?

02:19.907 --> 02:21.309
Hey!

02:21.342 --> 02:22.843
-Help me!
-(FLESH RIPPING)

02:22.876 --> 02:24.144
(SCREAMING)

02:28.716 --> 02:31.252
Aldebaran rum.
Deadly to humans,

02:31.285 --> 02:33.287
but a refreshing cocktail
for the two of you.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.955
Did you order this thing?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.190
Did I order this thing?

02:36.224 --> 02:38.292
No, it's from Giggles.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.361
Oh, she's blue.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.030
This is unbelievable.

02:43.063 --> 02:46.334
That's the fourth
round of drinks
some girl has sent over.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.935
Your friends are nice.

02:47.968 --> 02:52.940
Yeah, yeah. I'm lucky
to have them in my life.

02:52.973 --> 02:56.344
Makes being here on Earth
a little less lonely.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.479
Working here does that for me.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.947
I'm glad we found this place.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.782
I am, too.

03:04.918 --> 03:09.623
Hey, hello? Can you stop
flirt-drinking for one second?

03:09.657 --> 03:11.325
-Okay.
-You have been dodging
me for days.

03:11.359 --> 03:14.428
-You promised me
we would talk about a job.
-(GROANS)

03:14.462 --> 03:16.630
Even if it's not Catco,
you have to work.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.966
-I've found work. Mmm-hmm.
-That's great!

03:18.999 --> 03:20.568
-What is it?
-Um...

03:20.601 --> 03:23.904
Various things, and odds...
Odds and ends.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.873
At least, let me train you.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.008
You have all these powers
and you're not learning
how to control them.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.311
-I can control things.
-That's dangerous.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.581
-You have to know how to...
-(GLASS SHATTERS)

03:33.614 --> 03:35.816
-This was not
the prime example of that.
-Sure.

(SIGHS)

03:37.017 --> 03:38.051
I'll make a trade with you.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.289
You drink this drink,
and I will train with you.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.292
-I... I don't think so.
-You scared?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.898
-(SCOFFS) Oh, my God.
-(GROANS)

03:50.931 --> 03:53.534
That was very quick.
How do you feel?

03:55.636 --> 03:56.904
Floaty.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.842
-But I'm not floating.
-No, you're sitting.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.010
(BOTH LAUGHING)

04:05.879 --> 04:08.349
-Yes.
-And, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

04:08.382 --> 04:10.250
You have to train with me now!

04:10.751 --> 04:11.752
(GROANS)

04:11.785 --> 04:13.854
-Tomorrow.
-Anything you say.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.889
Whoa. That hits you fast.
(GASPS)

04:15.923 --> 04:17.425
I'm going to get us
two more drinks.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.992
I'm going to clean up
while you're gone.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.432
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.734
Hey!

04:26.767 --> 04:29.036
Hey, you look like my sister.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.504
Are you slurring your words?

04:31.071 --> 04:32.506
Am I?

04:33.741 --> 04:35.843
Chocolate.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.779
-Chocolate.
-Wow.

04:38.812 --> 04:42.483

That's... That's a first.

-Hey, have... Wow.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.587

04:48.422 --> 04:50.090
You... I'm driving you home.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.560
I'm not flying.
That's for sure. (CHUCKLES)

04:53.394 --> 04:56.096

04:56.129 --> 04:58.332
Yeah. Uh... Sorry.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.067
For what?

05:00.100 --> 05:03.804
Well, for coming in here
and dropping a bomb on you.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.940
That's not the first bomb
that's ever been
dropped on me.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.077
-How you doing with all that?
-(SIGHS)

05:10.110 --> 05:13.447
I just... I don't know
what to do now.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.549
You know, I mean,
I'm almost 30.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.552
(GIGGLES)
And I feel like a kid again.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.421
Well, everyone's experience
is different.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.122
I can only tell you
what I did.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.525
-Which was what?
-I came out to my family.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.828
-How did they take it?
-Well, uh...

05:27.861 --> 05:31.098
My dad isn't exactly known
for his open-mindedness,

05:31.131 --> 05:32.633
but he was pretty good.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.101
And, so was my mom.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.837
Maybe it's just a phase.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.639
You know, maybe it isn't real.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.642
No, it's real. You're real.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.745
And you deserve to have
a real, full, happy life.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.648
Okay? Tell your family.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.850
This is the biggest thing
that's ever happened to you,

05:49.883 --> 05:52.520
and you shouldn't have to
do it alone.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.855
-I have you.
-Yeah, you do.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.690
And I'm good for a drink
when you come out.

-You promise?
-Cross my heart.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.503

you know, I realize that...

12:24.878 --> 12:29.082
Maybe I've had
thoughts like this before.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.188

in high school?

-Vicki Donahue?
-Yeah, I remember Vicki.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.359
You guys had a really bad
falling out, right?

12:39.392 --> 12:43.196

12:49.903 --> 12:51.404

I think I felt something then,

13:00.447 --> 13:01.448
and it scared me.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.384
You know, because...
Because next thing I knew,

13:04.417 --> 13:08.488
I'm fighting with her
over something so stupid.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.223
And we just...

13:11.624 --> 13:13.861
We just drifted apart.

13:17.564 --> 13:22.269

-I don't know. I...

comes into contact with,

ALEX: He's a lobbyist for
climate-change deniers.

24:28.935 --> 24:31.504
He's also on the board of
National City University.

24:31.538 --> 24:32.739
He's been working
behind the scenes

24:32.772 --> 24:34.541
to oust Rudy Jones

Dr. Rudy Jones.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.119
You had me fired.

to get your job back,

24:48.821 --> 24:50.557

-No.

-Not before we drain him.

Well, I'm afraid Mr. O'Reilly
isn't on the menu tonight.

This planet doesn't take
to kindly to parasites.

Dr. Jones drained Kara

I don't know.
It might be one too many
alien DNAs in his system,

26:13.339 --> 26:14.473
but he's mutated.

26:14.506 --> 26:19.011
Okay, well, that's something
the DEO can handle, right?

26:21.347 --> 26:22.849

-He's lost a lot of blood.

seems to be targeting

-and that you would run
at the first sign of danger.
-Mmm.

My sister, she's the one
who believes in you.

29:08.815 --> 29:11.851

What can I do?
I'm not a doctor.

29:48.354 --> 29:52.291
He needs a blood transfusion.
From you.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.861
-My blood?
-The blood of a Green Martian.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.263

for squeamishness.

no because of custom,

38:37.148 --> 38:39.485
I'm buying, all night.
What are you having?

38:47.092 --> 38:48.694
Wow. (CHUCKLES)

38:48.727 --> 38:51.430
I've been wanting to do that.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.764
Yeah, I can tell.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.567
Was that not okay?

38:55.601 --> 38:57.503
You didn't do anything wrong.

38:59.004 --> 38:59.805
But something's wrong.

38:59.838 --> 39:04.042
Well, we're at
really different places.

39:05.544 --> 39:08.380
And everything
is changing for you.

39:08.414 --> 39:13.419
And everything
is going to feel
really heightened and shiny.

39:13.452 --> 39:17.689
And, um, you should
experience that for yourself.

39:17.723 --> 39:20.659
Not just to be with me.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.562
And I shouldn't get involved
with someone who's just
fresh off the boat.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.997
Those relationships
never really work out.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.032
Hmm.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.435
(SIGHS)

39:29.468 --> 39:32.771
I'm here for you,
but as a friend.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.574
Mmm-hmm.

39:37.476 --> 39:38.410
Are we cool?

39:38.444 --> 39:40.078
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

39:40.111 --> 39:41.713
Yeah. No, no, we're cool.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.482
Alex, don't go.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.883
I'll see you.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.489
KARA: (KNOCKING) Alex.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.491
Alex, ugh...
I can see you in there.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.159
Let me in please.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.694
Go away, Kara.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.499
(AIR WHOOSHING)

40:00.532 --> 40:02.200
What's going on?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.902
Nothing. Nothing is going on.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.671
You shouldn't have
come over here.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.739
Well, you didn't show up
for work, and that's
not like you,

40:07.773 --> 40:09.775
-so I got worried.
-You're right.

40:09.808 --> 40:12.177
-I should... I should go in.
-Wait, wait.

40:12.210 --> 40:15.947
-Something is clearly wrong.
-Everything is fine.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.550
-Is this about you coming out?
-No.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.019
And just forget I said
anything about it.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.187
Okay, forget it.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.523
Why? What does that mean?

40:24.556 --> 40:26.725
It means
that I made a mistake.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.594
Okay, I was wrong.

40:28.627 --> 40:29.895
And I shouldn't have
said anything.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.764
I should have just
kept my mouth shut.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.101
What happened?

40:40.038 --> 40:41.206
She doesn't like me.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.644
Like that.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.113
(SIGHS SADLY)

40:48.146 --> 40:50.115
(ALEX SOBBING)

40:52.183 --> 40:53.619
Come here.

40:56.021 --> 40:59.925
-(SOBBING)
It's so humiliating.
-No, no.

41:03.529 --> 41:04.563
(CRYING)

41:04.596 --> 41:06.197
I'm proud of you.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.670

41:20.078 --> 41:21.813
(MAN COUGHING)

41:26.585 --> 41:28.920
Hey, can I help you?

41:28.954 --> 41:31.557
I'm trying to be better,
so I'd love to help out.

41:31.590 --> 41:34.693
