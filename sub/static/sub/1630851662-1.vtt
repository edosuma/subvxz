-[television turns off]
-[Megan]<i> So,</i>

[Conner]
<i>It's time.</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:37.996
[Megan]<i> I guess it's time</i>
<i>I give this back.</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:40.915
[Conner]
<i>I hope not.</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:42.959
[Megan]<i> If you</i>
<i>don't trust me...</i>

00:43.042 --> 00:46.504
<i>if you can't</i>
<i>truly forgive me...</i>

00:46.588 --> 00:49.340
[Conner]
<i>I was hoping you'd trust</i>
<i>and forgive me.</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:53.762
<i>You made hard choices,</i>
<i>and I dredged up old wounds.</i>

00:53.845 --> 00:55.221
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:55.305 --> 00:58.016
<i>M'gann, I can't imagine</i>
<i>my life without you.</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:01.936
<i>So if you'll still have me--</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:16.826
[Megan]
<i>They fit!</i>

01:16.910 --> 01:18.286
<i>Now, quick, we have</i>
<i>to take them off again!</i>

01:18.369 --> 01:19.996
[Conner]
<i>For just a little while longer.</i>

01:20.079 --> 01:21.664
[Megan]
<i>I know, can you believe it?</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:23.458
<i>We're really gonna be married.</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:25.168
[Conner]
<i>Yeah. Twice.</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:27.212
[Megan]<i> Does that bother you?</i>
<i>You said it didn't bother you.</i>

01:27.295 --> 01:29.422
[Conner]<i> It doesn't.</i>
<i>I know it means a lot</i>

01:29.506 --> 01:30.715
<i>to your folks to have</i>

01:30.799 --> 01:32.175
<i>the religious ceremony</i>

01:32.258 --> 01:33.593
[Megan]<i> And then</i>
<i>it's right back here</i>

01:33.676 --> 01:35.094

<i>I promise.</i>

01:35.178 --> 01:36.679

-Have you tried?
-Not recently.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.526
Good morning, happy couple.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.027
-Morning.
-[Tara] So...

01:51.110 --> 01:52.195
today is the day?

01:52.278 --> 01:53.404
It is. [giggles]

01:53.488 --> 01:55.615
It just... Making
last minute preparations

01:55.698 --> 01:57.075
and waiting for Gar.

01:57.158 --> 02:00.370
I believe he was dealing
with some final logistics

02:00.453 --> 02:01.538
for the Outsiders.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.832
But he said he'd be here soon.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.209
Hey, Violet!

02:06.292 --> 02:08.920
-Good morning, Harper.
-[nervously] Good morning.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.296
Oh, hey.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.757
[giggles] Hello, Harper.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.009
Cullen, your book bag.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.219
Sorry.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.721
Your coffee, Mrs. Carr.

02:20.139 --> 02:22.559
Thank you, Mr. Carr.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.310
But if you
and all these kids plan

02:24.394 --> 02:26.771
to make it to school on time,
we'll need that spaceship moved

02:26.855 --> 02:27.814
to get our cars out.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.274
Bet that's something you never

02:29.357 --> 02:31.109
thought you'd say
before you married me.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.443
What are you grinning about?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.195
We live in a house
with a spaceship

02:34.279 --> 02:35.738

02:40.660 --> 02:42.245
You haven't told anyone, right?

02:42.328 --> 02:44.622
Please. I can keep a secret.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.875
Yeah, I guess you can.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.376
Hey, Cassie.

02:48.459 --> 02:49.752
Just checkin' you saw
the Outsiders' Flitter feed

02:49.836 --> 02:51.504
this morning.
There are two more legit

02:51.588 --> 02:53.464
requests for help there.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.426
Sorry, yeah, I know
you got this covered.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.428
Nah, trust me. I can let it go.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.179
I need the vay-cay, you know?

03:00.263 --> 03:01.472
I'm pretty fried.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.391
Right, yeah.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.476
You crush it, girl. Later.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.520
Uh, I'm so glad you're coming.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.730
Me too, sis.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.523
Kinda honored
to be invited, actually.

03:10.607 --> 03:14.277
And you're sure you don't mind
the month-long trip each way?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.195
Nah, I can use the sleep.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.822
I guess
you'll be missing Perdita.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.407
Oh, yeah, totally. But...

03:19.490 --> 03:21.576
we could probably both use
a breather.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.704
[growls]

03:26.372 --> 03:28.166
[moans]

03:28.249 --> 03:30.793
Well, someone'll
be missing someone.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.295
-[growls]
-[J'onn J'onzz] M'gann.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.880
All the necessary supplies

03:33.963 --> 03:36.925
and equipment are safely stowed
and ready for our journey.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.636
[Megan] Well, I guess this
is goodbye.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.930
We'll see you all back here
in three months

03:42.013 --> 03:43.139
for the wedding!

03:43.222 --> 03:44.891
Take care of Wolf
and Sphere for me.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.351
I promise.

-You don't mind if I drive,

03:51.898 --> 03:53.024
do you?

03:53.107 --> 03:54.567
I guess not.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.277
[whispering] Let's have
a little fun.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.238
[proclaiming] Engage
Engager-Mode!

04:03.701 --> 04:06.871
-That's new.
-[howls]

04:06.955 --> 04:08.957
Well, they're off to Mars.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.709
And, yes, that's another thing
I never thought I'd say.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.711
All right, everyone.
Time to get to school!

04:22.470 --> 04:24.555
[theme music playing]

04:59.966 --> 05:03.386
[Megan] Mmm. I don't know
why I'm so excited.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.556
Ten years ago, I couldn't wait
to leave this planet.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.057
Things are different now.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.767
[with mouth full] Or maybe
she's excited because

05:09.851 --> 05:11.060
you're sick of being cooped up

05:11.144 --> 05:12.353
on this ship for a month.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.105
Garfield, please don't talk

05:14.188 --> 05:15.940
with your mouth full
of toothpaste.

05:16.024 --> 05:16.899
It's gross.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.568
[with mouth full] Sorry.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.653
Bio-Ship, spittoon, please.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.366
Oh, yeah. Way less gross.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.244
S'all good. Bio-Ship likes
the minty freshness.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.996
Please tell me
you'll show better manners

05:30.079 --> 05:31.414
at my parents' home.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.500
Sorry, sorry.
I know I've been a little...

05:34.584 --> 05:35.835
cranky this trip.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.420
Huh. A little?

05:37.503 --> 05:39.047
Okay, okay, maybe a lot.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.257
I just can't sleep
back in those bunks.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.467
It's too quiet.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.969
But I'll behave. I promise.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.306
Hmm. It seems Bio-Ship would

05:48.389 --> 05:51.017
prefer to fly
the final distance herself.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.144
[Megan] She's excited
to be home too.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.359
[Megan] Bio-Ship says
a sandstorm's coming.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.444
[Superboy] Is that a problem?

06:01.527 --> 06:02.862
Mmm. Shouldn't be.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.739
We'll be underground
long before it catches up.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.784
Bio-Ship, take us directly
to the new Science Center

06:07.867 --> 06:09.327
in Ma'aleca'andra.

06:25.593 --> 06:30.139
Wow. I forgot
how big this place is.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.850
[J'onn J'onzz]
It is bigger than
when you were last here.

06:34.393 --> 06:38.064
Martians breed large families,
so like most of our cities,

06:38.147 --> 06:42.068
the capital Ma'aleca'andra
is constantly expanding.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.872
Gar, you better change too.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.750
Yeah, I wouldn't survive long,
even beneath the surface.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.085
Fortunately, I picked up

06:59.168 --> 07:02.004
a few tricks last time
we were here.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.925
And the Ma'arzuu Beast
is my favorite.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.970
It's tongue is so sensitive
I can taste the air.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.348
Mmm, rusty.

07:12.431 --> 07:13.724
Okay, I've already downloaded

07:13.808 --> 07:15.768
our telepathic language
to your brains,

07:15.852 --> 07:18.980
but that means you need
to watch your thoughts.

[M'gann telepathically]
<i>There's very little distance</i>

07:20.690 --> 07:23.276

<i>and saying it.</i>

07:24.610 --> 07:27.155

<i>Right.</i>

07:35.204 --> 07:36.873
<i>Um, never mind.</i>

07:36.956 --> 07:39.417
<i>You honor us</i>
<i>with this greeting.</i>

07:39.500 --> 07:42.712
<i>I am Conner Kent,</i>
<i>and this is Garfield Logan.</i>

07:42.795 --> 07:43.963
[Beast Boy]<i> Hey.</i>

07:44.046 --> 07:46.465
<i>I am</i>

<i>of the Science Center--</i>

07:48.134 --> 07:49.385
[M'gann]<i> W-wait.</i>
<i>You're the Chief Scientist?</i>

07:49.468 --> 07:51.012
<i>In charge of the Zeta project?</i>

07:51.095 --> 07:52.638
<i>Why wouldn't I be?</i>

07:53.514 --> 07:54.390
[Superboy clears throat]

07:54.473 --> 07:55.516
[M'gann]<i> Sorry.</i>

07:55.600 --> 07:57.059
<i>Conner, Garfield,</i>

07:57.143 --> 08:00.021
<i>this is my sister,</i>
<i>M'ree M'orzz.</i>

08:00.104 --> 08:03.691
<i>Actually, I go</i>
<i>by Em'ree J'onzz now.</i>

08:03.774 --> 08:05.818
<i>Hello, Uncle J'onn.</i>

08:05.902 --> 08:08.571
<i>Hello... um, Em'ree.</i>

08:08.654 --> 08:11.532
<i>I'll just get the rest</i>
<i>of the equipment.</i>

08:11.616 --> 08:13.618
<i>Does Dad know you</i>
<i>changed your name?</i>

08:13.701 --> 08:15.077
<i>He's fine with it.</i>

08:15.161 --> 08:17.371
<i>You know Dad.</i>
<i>Nothing gets to him.</i>

08:17.455 --> 08:19.790
[Superboy]<i> Uh, we've... heard</i>
<i>a lot about you.</i>

08:19.874 --> 08:21.626
<i>Good things, I hope?</i>

08:21.709 --> 08:24.587
<i>Totally. Your folks seemed</i>
<i>really proud of you.</i>

08:24.670 --> 08:28.216
[Em'ree]
<i>Ah, you heard about me</i>
<i>from our parents.</i>

08:28.299 --> 08:29.800
<i>That's nice.</i>

08:29.884 --> 08:32.595
<i>I'd like you both to feel</i>
<i>more comfortable here,</i>

08:32.678 --> 08:35.473
<i>so perhaps</i>
<i>if I changed forms...</i>

08:37.558 --> 08:40.144
<i>I believe this</i>
<i>is an Earth favorite.</i>

08:40.228 --> 08:42.104
[M'gann annoyed]
<i>She has six freckles, not four.</i>

08:42.188 --> 08:43.814
<i>You know that.</i>

08:43.898 --> 08:45.524
[Superboy]<i> It isn't necessary</i>
<i>to change your form for us.</i>

08:45.608 --> 08:47.026
<i>Especially if you're</i>
<i>gonna creep me out</i>

08:47.109 --> 08:48.778
<i>by looking like my mom.</i>

08:48.861 --> 08:50.905
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>That wasn't my intent.</i>

08:50.988 --> 08:55.201
<i>And I meant that to be</i>
<i>a private thought. Sorry.</i>

08:55.284 --> 08:56.202
<i>Not a problem.</i>

08:56.285 --> 08:57.536
<i>I always preferred,</i>

08:57.620 --> 09:00.206
Hello, Megan!'s
<i>Rita character anyway.</i>

09:00.289 --> 09:02.416
<i>Oh, yeah. That's much better.</i>

09:02.500 --> 09:05.002
[J'onn J'onzz]<i> I believe</i>
<i>this is everything.</i>

09:05.086 --> 09:08.047
[M'gann]<i> Okay, Bio-Ship,</i>
<i>you're free to go.</i>

09:08.130 --> 09:09.048
<i>Have fun!</i>

09:13.469 --> 09:15.096
[Superboy]<i> What do Bio-Ships</i>
<i>do for fun?</i>

09:15.179 --> 09:17.431
[J'onn J'onzz]<i> We could begin</i>
<i>construction now.</i>

09:17.515 --> 09:19.141
<i>It would be preferable</i>
<i>to complete</i>

09:19.225 --> 09:21.185
<i>the work before the nuptials.</i>

09:21.269 --> 09:22.645
<i>You guys don't have to stay.</i>

09:22.728 --> 09:24.522
<i>Mom and Dad are eager</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

09:24.605 --> 09:25.940
<i>I've arranged transportation.</i>

09:26.023 --> 09:27.650
[M'gann]<i> That won't</i>
<i>be necessary.</i>

09:27.733 --> 09:29.277
[Beast Boy]
<i>We wanna see the city!</i>

09:29.360 --> 09:30.987
[nervously]<i> But what kind</i>
<i>of host would I be--</i>

09:31.070 --> 09:32.488
-[Superboy]<i> We don't mind.</i>
-[Beast Boy]<i> Honest.</i>

09:32.572 --> 09:33.781
[M'gann]<i> But thank you</i>
<i>for the offer.</i>

09:44.000 --> 09:47.545
[indistinct telepathic chatter]

10:06.522 --> 10:08.399
[M'gann]<i> Whoa. So much sending.</i>

10:08.482 --> 10:11.527
<i>I'd forgotten how much</i>
<i>psychic noise</i>
<i>there is on M'arzz.</i>

10:11.610 --> 10:13.738
-[G'arrunn 1] Ma'al<i> Earthers.</i>
-[G'arrunn 2]<i> It's no surprise</i>

10:13.821 --> 10:15.197
<i>they're here</i>
<i>with that A'ashenn.</i>

10:15.281 --> 10:17.033
[M'gann]
<i>And not all of it pleasant.</i>

10:17.116 --> 10:18.576
[Beast Boy]<i> It's not all bad.</i>

10:18.659 --> 10:21.203
<i>Some of it's just... weird.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:22.955
<i>I mean... yikes!</i>

10:23.039 --> 10:24.790
<i>Well, Uncle J'onn</i>
<i>has been forwarding</i>

10:24.874 --> 10:28.044
<i>Earth television signals</i>
<i>to M'arzz since the 1960s.</i>

10:28.127 --> 10:29.962
<i>Those shows have a lot of fans.</i>

10:30.046 --> 10:33.883

13:16.378 --> 13:18.881

<i>I understand the basic</i>

<i>Martian caste system,</i>
<i>the red B'lahdenn Martians</i>

13:23.427 --> 13:25.429
<i>The G'arrunn</i>
<i>are the ethnic Majority.</i>

<i>And the A'ashenn</i>
<i>are the ethnic Minority.</i>

13:28.098 --> 13:30.809

13:30.893 --> 13:32.853
<i>Can a Martian be born Y'ellonn?</i>

13:32.937 --> 13:36.815
[M'aatt]<i> No, but any Martian,</i>
<i>B'lahdenn, G'arrunn,</i>
<i>or A'ashenn</i>

13:36.899 --> 13:39.652
<i>with a calling can become</i>
<i>a priest or priestess</i>

<i>by permanently morphing his,</i>
<i>her or their skin to Y'ellonn.</i>

13:43.739 --> 13:44.782
[M'gann]<i> But turning Y'ellonn</i>

13:44.865 --> 13:46.408

had stated publicly

were genetically identical,

[R'ohh K'arr]<i> You may proceed.</i>

21:04.513 --> 21:06.098
<i>The Queen approves.</i>

21:11.937 --> 21:13.230
[R'ess]<i> I come, My Queen,</i>

21:13.313 --> 21:15.732
<i>with a mindlink</i>
<i>one thousand strong,</i>

21:15.816 --> 21:20.737
<i>to stop the insanity that is</i>
<i>this Earther Zeta-Tube!</i>

21:20.821 --> 21:24.741
[Beast Boy in pain]
Ma'al, ma'al,
ma'al, ma'al, ma'al!

21:24.825 --> 21:26.076
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

21:26.159 --> 21:27.703
[M'gann]<i> A massive mindlink.</i>

21:27.786 --> 21:29.705
<i>I-I just put up another filter</i>
<i>for you both.</i>

21:29.788 --> 21:31.707
<i>Why wasn't it up</i>
<i>in the first damn place?</i>

21:31.790 --> 21:32.749
[Superboy]<i> Gar, chill!</i>

21:32.833 --> 21:34.042
<i>She's just trying to help.</i>

21:34.126 --> 21:37.170
<i>Yeah. Yeah, sorry, M'gann.</i>

21:37.254 --> 21:39.047
Superman. We are ready.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.382
<i>So are we, J'onn.</i>

21:40.465 --> 21:41.883
<i>We've temporarily moved</i>
<i>the Watchtower</i>

21:41.967 --> 21:43.385
<i>above Sardath's Zeta-Shield</i>

21:43.468 --> 21:45.429
<i>that guards Earth</i>
<i>from Zeta-Incursion.</i>

21:45.512 --> 21:46.346
<i>You're good to go.</i>

21:46.430 --> 21:47.931
<i>Listen, my people.</i>

21:48.015 --> 21:51.018
<i>Your strength and unity</i>
<i>is most impressive,</i>

21:51.101 --> 21:53.270
<i>but your cause is misguided.</i>

21:53.353 --> 21:56.982
<i>We must cooperate with Earth,</i>
<i>because our galaxy</i>

21:57.065 --> 21:59.401
<i>is full of dangers to M'arzz.</i>

21:59.484 --> 22:02.529
[R'ess]<i> Earth is a danger</i>
<i>to M'arzz!</i>

22:02.612 --> 22:05.073
[chanting]<i> Earth is a danger</i>
<i>to M'arzz.</i>

22:05.157 --> 22:07.367
<i>Earth is a danger to M'arzz.</i>

22:07.451 --> 22:09.411
[J'ann]<i> Must you leave,</i>
<i>big brother?</i>

22:09.494 --> 22:11.163
<i>You only just arrived.</i>

22:11.246 --> 22:12.914
<i>And the wedding...</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:16.001
<i>I will zeta to the Watchtower</i>
<i>and zeta right back here.</i>

22:16.084 --> 22:17.753
<i>It will be fine.</i>

22:17.836 --> 22:20.297
[J'arlia]<i> Not all of Earth</i>
<i>is dangerous.</i>

22:20.380 --> 22:22.507
<i>Only some of their meta-humans.</i>

22:22.591 --> 22:24.509
<i>We need</i>
<i>our sister planet's help</i>

22:24.593 --> 22:28.764
<i>to identify which ones are</i>
<i>being used by Apokolips.</i>

22:28.847 --> 22:29.723
[M'gann]<i> M'comm!</i>

We've got you, Ma'alefa'ak!

22:35.479 --> 22:37.773
<i>You're not</i>
<i>density-shifting away</i>
<i>this time!</i>

22:37.856 --> 22:39.775
[M'aatt]<i> M'comm?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

22:39.858 --> 22:41.985
[M'comm]<i> Very good, M'gann.</i>

22:42.069 --> 22:46.365
<i>No one else detected me,</i>
<i>save you, my sister.</i>

22:46.448 --> 22:48.325
<i>I'm her brother, not you!</i>

22:48.408 --> 22:50.786
<i>You don't deserve</i>
<i>to have M'gann for a sister!</i>

22:50.869 --> 22:52.454
[M'gann]<i> Gar, not now.</i>

22:52.537 --> 22:54.748
<i>R'ess E'dda is wrong.</i>

22:54.831 --> 22:56.958
<i>Earth is not the danger.</i>

22:57.042 --> 22:58.919
<i>Apokolips is the danger.</i>

22:59.002 --> 23:02.089
<i>You're ignoring the danger</i>
<i>to our culture,</i>

23:02.172 --> 23:03.507
<i>our way of life!</i>

23:03.590 --> 23:07.469
[J'onn J'onzz]
<i>My fellow Martians, hear me!</i>

23:07.552 --> 23:12.641
<i>Earth and its heroes will fight</i>
<i>to protect our culture!</i>

23:12.724 --> 23:15.519
<i>And what's best</i>
<i>about our way of life</i>

23:15.602 --> 23:18.730
<i>is not as fragile</i>
<i>as R'ess E'dda</i>

23:18.814 --> 23:20.357
<i>would have you believe!</i>

23:20.440 --> 23:23.110
[M'gann]<i> Manhunter,</i>
<i>I've checked M'comm's mind.</i>

23:23.193 --> 23:26.071
<i>He only just arrived and didn't</i>
<i>have time to do anything.</i>

23:26.154 --> 23:28.532
<i>It should be safe to test</i>
<i>the Zeta-Tube.</i>

23:28.615 --> 23:31.493
[J'arlia]<i> You all know</i>
<i>of J'onn J'onzz,</i>

23:31.576 --> 23:33.161
<i>our greatest M'hontrr.</i>

23:33.245 --> 23:36.164
<i>He has demonstrated</i>
<i>that Earth and M'arzz</i>

23:36.248 --> 23:38.458
<i>can be strong allies.</i>

23:38.542 --> 23:43.964
<i>In the final analysis,</i>
<i>do we not trust J'onn J'onzz?</i>

23:46.424 --> 23:48.844
[R'ess]<i> You fools, don't leave!</i>

23:48.927 --> 23:50.387
<i>J'onn J'onzz has brought</i>

23:50.470 --> 23:52.222
<i>the Earther corruption</i>
<i>to our world!</i>

23:52.305 --> 23:56.685
[J'arlia]<i> J'onn J'onzz has</i>
<i>brought honor to two worlds.</i>

23:56.768 --> 23:59.104

-[snoring]
-[Dinah]<i> As you know,</i>
<i>Black Lightning,</i>

24:36.308 --> 24:37.934
<i>Jefferson has put a priority</i>

24:38.018 --> 24:40.353
<i>He's asked M'gann and I</i>

<i>with every member</i>
<i>of the League,</i>

<i>Team, and Outsiders.</i>

24:43.565 --> 24:45.734
<i>So I'm checking in.</i>

24:45.817 --> 24:47.402
<i>How are you doing, Violet?</i>

24:47.485 --> 24:49.738
<i>I know it's been a year,</i>
<i>but how are you managing</i>

<i>your feelings about Brion?</i>

24:52.324 --> 24:56.411
[Violet]<i> I do not believe</i>
<i>I fully understand my feelings</i>

24:56.494 --> 24:58.580
<i>about Brion, even now.</i>

24:58.663 --> 25:02.500
<i>Truthfully, I am still</i>
<i>mystified by his choices.</i>

25:02.584 --> 25:04.544
<i>It makes me sad and</i>

25:04.628 --> 25:07.380
<i>it makes me consider</i>
<i>my own choices</i>

25:07.464 --> 25:10.926
<i>and how those choices</i>
<i>may inform my journey.</i>

25:11.009 --> 25:13.762
[Dinah]<i> What choices</i>
<i>are we talking about?</i>

25:13.845 --> 25:15.347
[Violet]<i> Islam, for one.</i>

25:15.430 --> 25:19.059
<i>Gabrielle's faith</i>
<i>was very important to her.</i>

25:19.142 --> 25:21.561
<i>So important,</i>
<i>I cannot bring myself</i>

25:21.645 --> 25:23.730
<i>to remove the hijab she wore.</i>

25:23.813 --> 25:25.398
<i>I think...</i>

25:25.482 --> 25:29.194
<i>I think I need to explore</i>
<i>whether or not Islam holds</i>

25:29.277 --> 25:32.614
<i>meaning for me,</i>
<i>as it did for her.</i>
