00:01.960 --> 00:04.740
- You are the reason
that I work on this show.

00:04.840 --> 00:06.540
- To hell with being a producer.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.380
You're the suitress.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.020
Is puzzle boy part of your bangathon?

00:11.120 --> 00:12.660
- Let's get this party started!

00:12.760 --> 00:14.780
- [Jay] A full on frat boy date raped her.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.380
- You just feel guilty we hooked up,

00:16.480 --> 00:17.860
because you're supposed
to on the show for Adam.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.100
- You cheated on the suitor?

00:19.200 --> 00:20.860
- He raped you, just say it you coward.

00:20.960 --> 00:21.700
- Rachel.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.100
- And I know what the show does to people,

00:23.200 --> 00:26.080
it's hard to tell what
is real and what's not.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.900
- The person who is really
taken with you is Noelle.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.180
- Really?
- I'd make a move.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.740
You need to expose him
for who he really is.

00:36.840 --> 00:37.580
If you leave now,

00:37.680 --> 00:39.940
everyone's gonna think
that you were lying.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.660
- [Carolyn] My water broke!

00:41.760 --> 00:43.660
- Three of our contestants
are helping deliver

00:43.760 --> 00:45.760
an actual women's baby.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.500
- God, she can barely stand up.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.180
- Come on Maya.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.020
- It's okay.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.120
- What the hell is going on?

00:52.800 --> 00:55.120
(screaming)

01:00.760 --> 01:03.360
(sombre music)

01:14.320 --> 01:17.340
- Well, little Chetty's asleep upstairs.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.940
I sent our attorney
with Maya to the station

01:20.040 --> 01:23.620
and I'm gonna go visit
Roger at the hospital,

01:23.720 --> 01:25.420
so you got to take this.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.720
- That limey prick better not say a word.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.880
- I got you, kiddo.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.340
- Dios mÃ­o, I can't believe
we delivered a baby,

01:35.440 --> 01:37.020
I mean, I'm not gonna sleep for a week.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.220
(all laugh)

01:38.320 --> 01:39.860
- It's one of life's
last true miracles, mate.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.820
- Hey, when are we supposed
to get the cigar bar?

01:41.920 --> 01:43.380
- Yeah, where are the others, Tommy?

01:43.480 --> 01:46.720
- They're in the next van,
probably right behind us,

01:47.720 --> 01:49.720
but we should be close.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.540
- Yeah, you know, we were all so focused

01:54.640 --> 01:56.660
on the surprise baby delivery,

01:56.760 --> 02:00.180
we had no idea that two of
our contestants went rogue.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.540
I mean, all I can think
is that maybe it was

02:02.640 --> 02:04.180
a lover's quarrel that got out of hand.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.740
- Lover's quarrel don't normally end

02:05.840 --> 02:07.100
in attempted castration.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.380
- Well, there's nothing normal
about a reality TV show.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.420
I mean, these contestants,
they lose it sometimes,

02:12.520 --> 02:14.780
which is why we have them
all sign liability waivers

02:14.880 --> 02:18.060
for just these types of
unfortunate incidents.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.740
- And we appreciate your discretion

02:19.840 --> 02:22.620
not putting it out on the
scanner for the press to pick up.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.180
I think we can agree that
all parties will benefit

02:25.280 --> 02:28.760
from as much privacy as possible.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.740
- You'll contact me when
the contestants get back?

02:35.840 --> 02:37.840
- Cross my heart.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.520
(tense music)

02:50.280 --> 02:53.040
(sirens wailing)

02:55.760 --> 02:59.000
(screaming and crying)

03:00.880 --> 03:03.240
- Hurry up and get in here,
we have to figure this out.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.140
- Okay, I want water
breaking and screaming.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.500
Lots and lots of screaming.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.580
- [Editor] What about the-
- What the hell is this?

03:13.680 --> 03:15.740
- I'm making the episode,
Baby Everlasting,

03:15.840 --> 03:17.260
the only thing getting sliced around here

03:17.360 --> 03:18.940
is the umbilical cord.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.260
- Wait, where's Maya and Roger,

03:20.360 --> 03:21.700
that's the best story we've every done.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.420
- Oh, you mean the story
where Roger got stabbed,

03:24.520 --> 03:27.100
and Noelle got raped and
you let it all happen.

03:27.200 --> 03:27.900
I don't think so.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.220
- There was no actual penetration,

03:29.320 --> 03:30.460
that was sexual assault at best.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.560
- So we're parsing rape now?

03:33.680 --> 03:34.460
Good to know.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.140
Devin, little Chet is asleep,

03:36.240 --> 03:37.940
let me know if he makes any noise,

03:38.040 --> 03:40.140
this is your only job for
the rest of the night.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.580
- Yeah, but-
- Go, now!

03:41.680 --> 03:44.660
- Alright, the contestants
are back at R Bar celebrating,

03:44.760 --> 03:47.660
since the cigar bar, you know
the one that never existed,

03:47.760 --> 03:49.620
burned down in a freak electrical fire.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.500
- No, they've celebrated enough,

03:51.600 --> 03:52.540
I want them camera ready,

03:52.640 --> 03:54.380
we're doing a choosing ceremony now.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.460
- Choosing? (scoffs)

03:55.560 --> 03:57.780
- We've had enough people
eliminated for the night,

03:57.880 --> 03:59.620
don't you think?

03:59.720 --> 04:03.060
I need everyone paired off
and in their rooms A.S.A.P,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.100
so that none of these dopes start talking.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.660
Jay's in the room with Noelle right now

04:06.760 --> 04:08.620
to make sure that she keeps her trap shut.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.500
- Wait, wait, wait, don't we
need to reveal the stabbing,

04:10.600 --> 04:12.820
get the reactions, build the story out?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.860
- As far as the outside world is concerned

04:14.960 --> 04:16.060
that never happened.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.620
- This is crazy, Maya stabbing her rapist

04:18.720 --> 04:20.460
to stop him from raping someone else

04:20.560 --> 04:22.700
is the kind of story gold
headlines are made for.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.220
- Using Noelle's sexual
assault exposes us in a way

04:26.320 --> 04:28.660
that will shut this show
down in a heart beat.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.700
Alright, I want that
footage under lock and key,

04:30.800 --> 04:33.520
that story is dead, meeting adjourned.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.700
- Busted your ass to make an amazing show,

04:37.800 --> 04:38.860
and it's not even gonna air.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.660
- Well, apparently some
people think a kid crowning

04:40.760 --> 04:42.900
is more compelling than an
actual attempted murder.

04:43.000 --> 04:43.900
- Quinn's a dinosaur.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.580
She and Chet just don't have the stomach

04:45.680 --> 04:46.860
to make the kinda noise we wanna make.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.900
- No kidding.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.900
- We can't just let this go,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.580
I mean, I get how the show

04:50.680 --> 04:53.820
and we personally could
be exposed here but,

04:53.920 --> 04:56.020
What?

04:56.120 --> 04:58.120
- Maybe there's a way around it.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.400
- Hey, thank you.
- Sure.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.860
- Noelle?

05:12.960 --> 05:14.580
- Hmm?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.680
- Hi.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.300
- What is this?

05:18.400 --> 05:21.320
- It's a hydration drip,
it'll help with the hangover.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.740
- Wait, what happened, I'm trying to...

05:27.840 --> 05:30.480
- Noelle, Roger assaulted you.

05:31.480 --> 05:34.320
You were barely conscious,
but he had his hands all over you.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.180
- Oh my god.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.700
Oh my god, and Maya and
the blood, is he dead?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.860
- No, he's at the hospital.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.340
Look, I'm supposed to be here,

05:44.440 --> 05:45.780
making sure that you keep quiet

05:45.880 --> 05:48.180
but I am not gonna do that, I can't.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.940
You need to go to the police
and you need to file a report.

05:51.040 --> 05:51.860
- What?
- Now.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.860
- Whoa, wait Jay, wait,
Jay, this is crazy.

05:53.960 --> 05:57.040
This is crazy.
- I know, listen to me-

05:58.560 --> 06:00.560
- Oh, hi.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.540
Just checking in to see
how everything's going.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.640
You up for the ceremony?

06:09.320 --> 06:11.600
We should get you dressed
and back on camera.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.300
You were pretty out of
it, okay, but don't worry,

06:19.400 --> 06:20.460
we are not going to air

06:20.560 --> 06:22.820
any embarrassing footage or anything.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.380
We're gonna protect you.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.300
- Yeah, actually Noelle and I-

06:26.400 --> 06:28.560
- No, Jay, hey, everything's fine.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.300
- Good.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.340
So Jay, I need you to get Sofia dressed,

06:35.440 --> 06:37.440
and twirling your moustache in 20.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
- Good.

06:45.760 --> 06:46.820
(door thuds)

06:46.920 --> 06:48.460
- No, no, can you just
push in tight on there.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.100
I really wanna go up
close on Noelle's face.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.900
I want to see that she's like passed out.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.780
- What the hell is this?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.260
I said no.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.400
- Whoa, wait, you told
me that Quinn signed off-

06:56.480 --> 06:58.140
- Come on, I can make this work.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
- Get out, right now!

07:02.280 --> 07:04.740
I am still your boss
and you do what I say.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.180
- Actually, no.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.040
Alright, I've moved beyond you,

07:07.120 --> 07:10.220
I have my own relationship
with Fiona and she trusts me.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.700
- Oh, really?
- Yeah,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.220
and I'm gonna give her a top three episode

07:13.320 --> 07:14.620
so why don't you just sit
back and take the wind

07:14.720 --> 07:16.860
like you've been doing all season, okay.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.460
(Quinn scoffs)

07:18.560 --> 07:20.460
- You know, I should've shut
this down from the beginning

07:20.560 --> 07:23.820
as soon as I saw that you were
bringing back Roger and Maya.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.740
- Please, you loved it.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.800
You knew exactly the kind of
ratings that it was gonna get.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.860
- You're way out of your league.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.660
You're going to bring
this whole show down.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.140
- No, I'm not.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.120
As long as Fiona doesn't find out

07:36.200 --> 07:38.800
that we knew what was going
on, we are in the clear.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.800
You got that, boss?

07:47.080 --> 07:49.080
- Somebody get me Jay, now.

07:52.080 --> 07:56.100
- Ah, you must be Chet, I'm
Gregor Fields, Roger's lawyer.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.420
- Ah, Chet, and I called the
ambulance you chased over here.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.580
- Roger's penis is irreparably damaged.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.260
We are gonna sue you, the
show, and the network.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.620
- I'm not so sure that Roger's parents

08:07.720 --> 08:09.940
are gonna be thrilled
about litigating a case

08:10.040 --> 08:13.620
once they find out what Roger
and his formerly intact penis

08:13.720 --> 08:15.700
were doing at the time of the stabbing.

08:15.800 --> 08:19.860
- Your trashy little show allowed
a sexual assault to occur.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.060
I'm sure it's not the first bad thing

08:21.160 --> 08:22.740
to happen on your watch, and personally,

08:22.840 --> 08:25.840
I can't wait to get into
your files and start digging.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.180
See you in court.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.840
(light music)

08:32.920 --> 08:34.380
- I will not stay on this

08:34.480 --> 08:36.900
vile excuse for a show another second.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.500
I have had enough,
Quinn, I'm done, I'm out.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.860
- How about you start
acting like a grown ass man

08:41.960 --> 08:45.020
and face the storm instead
of running away from it.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.180
(Jay sighs)

08:46.280 --> 08:47.700
Quitting is not going to do anything

08:47.800 --> 08:49.420
to help your precious little prom queen.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.220
- Yeah, you're right.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.020
You know what, I should just
go straight to the police

08:53.120 --> 08:54.180
and tell them everything.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.780
- When Noelle doesn't
even wanna talk about it.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.420
I mean, we are just now at a point

08:59.520 --> 09:03.560
where people might actually
listen to her, let alone you.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.020
- So what, Quinn, we just do nothing?

09:08.120 --> 09:12.380
- No, you go to the network.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.260
Be a whistleblower.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.340
Tell Fiona the truth.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.740
A rogue producer went
behind everyone's back

09:18.840 --> 09:20.500
and damn near brought the show down.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.220
- Why don't you just tell Fiona?

09:22.320 --> 09:23.860
- I can't know any of this.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.220
If the executive producer is implicated,

09:26.320 --> 09:28.220
they will shut down the show.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.420
260 people will lose their jobs,

09:31.520 --> 09:32.940
but if you do it,

09:33.040 --> 09:35.840
you can root out this
cancer once and for all.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.140
- Rachel.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.240
You're talking about Rachel.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.960
Your Rachel.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.300
- It's time.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.400
(suspenseful music)

09:55.160 --> 09:57.500
- Ugh, let's go, Graham,
let's get this over with.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.740
- Three, two, one, action.

09:59.840 --> 10:04.840
- Welcome contestants, to this,
our evening of explanations.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.420
Now, I'm sure all of you have noticed

10:06.520 --> 10:08.380
that two of your own are missing tonight.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.860
Seems that during the excitement
of the miracle of life,

10:11.960 --> 10:14.820
Maya and Roger had a minor accident.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.660
- What?
- What?

10:15.760 --> 10:16.520
- Are they okay?
- [Graham] They're fine.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.980
- What do you mean by accident, mate?

10:18.080 --> 10:20.100
- It's nothing, I'll explain
later, they're gonna be fine,

10:20.200 --> 10:23.420
but sadly, that means
they're off the show.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.940
- Mm, try not to look too sad, Sofia.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.140
- But what that does mean

10:27.240 --> 10:29.300
is that the guys outnumber the gals,

10:29.400 --> 10:30.500
So in order to keep an even number,

10:30.600 --> 10:32.620
we've decided here at Everlasting

10:32.720 --> 10:36.000
to bring back the last
contestant eliminated.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.340
The lovely Candy Coco. (applauds)

10:39.440 --> 10:41.980
- Seriously.
- What?

10:42.080 --> 10:43.780
This is so not fair.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.340
- I don't want to be
here either, you bitches.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.220
It's five A.M. and I'm
usually naked by now.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.180
- Finally, somebody with
some life left in them.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.140
- Look on the bright side,

10:51.240 --> 10:53.060
you're one step closer
to that million dollars.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.060
That is a whole lot of singles.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.460
- Yeah, try hundos, Graham.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.660
- Okay, well said.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.140
Well, there you have it America,

11:00.240 --> 11:01.700
your final six!

11:01.800 --> 11:04.560
(light applause)

11:06.040 --> 11:06.920
- Oh really, is that what
you want to do, Graham?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.620
Is that are you feel?

11:08.720 --> 11:10.140
Well, me too.
- Okay.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.580
Onto the choosing ceremony.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.020
Our ladies will select

11:14.120 --> 11:15.700
the guy that they want to
spend the night tonight.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.300
- God, Noelle's a wreck.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.620
- She'll be fine, please.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.380
- Starting of course
with the lovely Sofia.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.840
- Rodrigo, shall we
finish what we started?

11:26.200 --> 11:27.780
- Yeah.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.820
- Candy, your choice,
which one will it be?

11:29.920 --> 11:32.140
- August.
- Okay, yep, got it.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.020
- Can't get rid of me that easily, mate.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.700
- Welcome back. (Candy snickers)

11:35.800 --> 11:38.140
- Noelle, obviously you and Doctor Jack.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.780
There you have it, America,
the six have chosen,

11:40.880 --> 11:42.140
but you may wanna rest up,

11:42.240 --> 11:45.460
you see the road to a
million dollars, as in love,

11:45.560 --> 11:50.260
is filled with unexpected
twists and turns.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.180
- Okay, that's a cut.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.580
- Twists and turns?

11:52.680 --> 11:54.700
Dude, that's so vanilla,
who wrote that crap?

11:54.800 --> 11:55.500
- You did.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.140
- What the hell happened
with Maya and Roger.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.220
- Yeah, what the hell is going on here.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.860
I damn near had a police
escort back to this place.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.780
- Okay, this was exactly
what I didn't want.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.940
All of you get out there
and shut this down.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.580
I want them locked in their
rooms immediately, now, go.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.260
- You ready, we gotta move fast.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.500
- Sure, let's shut this down.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.340
(Rachel laughs)

12:13.440 --> 12:15.720
- That is very interesting,
do you have a name?

12:16.640 --> 12:18.380
Thank you.
- Was that about Roger?

12:18.480 --> 12:19.700
How'd it go, we good?

12:19.800 --> 12:22.420
- Oh, he knocked me back with a left hook

12:22.520 --> 12:23.740
but I got plenty of punches left.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.500
(baby screaming on monitor)

12:25.600 --> 12:26.860
- I think he's waking up.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.500
- You think?

12:28.600 --> 12:30.460
Get out of here!

12:30.560 --> 12:33.780
- Come on, I'll take
care of everything, okay.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.880
I got it.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.520
- Just give me a second here.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.640
Usually I have someone
else doing this for me.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.740
Listen, I'm just as in
the dark as you guys are.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.420
Did either of you see
anything weird last night?

12:50.520 --> 12:54.020
- Please, Maya has been
acting weird all season.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.620
- I don't know Rachel, this whole thing,

12:55.720 --> 12:56.620
it doesn't smell right.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.860
- I'm trying to find out what I can

12:57.960 --> 13:00.900
but Quinn is keeping everything
really close to the vest,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.060
and that's why I need your help.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.540
- Maya was like full
on obsessed with Roger.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.620
- Really?
- Yes, you heard her.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.500
Whatever she was saying

13:08.600 --> 13:10.540
about what happened between
them their first season.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.940
- Maya's a great girl,

13:12.040 --> 13:14.100
but she's had something
going on since she got here.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.700
Now with Roger, he seems
like a nice enough bloke,

13:16.800 --> 13:18.420
but there's something about
him that really got to her.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.060
- Please, that girl has been
a sad sack since day one.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.540
- And then last night,
she saw Noelle and Roger

13:24.640 --> 13:25.740
starting to hook up and

13:25.840 --> 13:27.580
she went all Fatal Attraction on them.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.820
Staring at them from across
the room, it was so creepy.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.180
- So Noelle was with Roger last night?

13:33.280 --> 13:36.460
- I'm so sorry, babe, I just
thought that you should know.

13:36.560 --> 13:40.920
- I know damaged girls, and
she is for sure one of them.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.860
- Maya was pissed.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.100
I'm surprised he didn't end up

13:45.200 --> 13:47.560
in little Tupperware
containers in her freezer.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.740
- Hey Jay, how's Noelle?

13:53.840 --> 13:55.820
- Please, like you give a shit.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.220
Noelle was sexually assaulted

13:57.320 --> 13:59.220
and Maya is in jail because of you.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.020
- Maya knew what she was signing up for.

14:01.120 --> 14:01.900
(Jay sighs)

14:02.000 --> 14:03.620
Okay, she came back here and she stayed,

14:03.720 --> 14:06.340
even after she saw Roger that first night.

14:06.440 --> 14:09.440
She stayed, and so did you Jay.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.140
- Yeah, that's right.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.200
And that's how I know exactly
what happened, Rachel.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.680
I'm gonna make sure it
never happens again.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.140
(door thuds)

14:29.240 --> 14:32.000
(dramatic music)

14:39.320 --> 14:41.460
- Quinn's had her eye off
the ball this whole season

14:41.560 --> 14:43.700
and now we're actually stabbing people,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.020
so unless you'd like to join me

14:45.120 --> 14:46.380
in my three hour meeting with legal-

14:46.480 --> 14:48.420
- No, I didn't come here
to talk about the stabbing,

14:48.520 --> 14:50.520
I came here to tell you about the rape.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.740
- Rape, what, Quinn didn't
say anything about that.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.740
- Quinn doesn't know anything about it.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.540
It's why Maya stabbed Roger,

14:58.640 --> 15:01.120
he was assaulting Noelle
and Maya stopped him.

15:03.760 --> 15:07.180
- Okay, I'm gonna need you to think

15:07.280 --> 15:10.060
very carefully about
the next thing you say,

15:10.160 --> 15:11.220
because if what you're saying happened.

15:11.320 --> 15:12.340
- Oh, it happened.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.440
Rachel Goldberg made it happen.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.320
She orchestrated the entire thing.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.340
- Spill.

15:20.440 --> 15:23.160
(elevator dings)

15:34.320 --> 15:37.000
(door knocking)

15:39.720 --> 15:40.620
- Mistress Carver.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.720
- Chet.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.180
I have a strict over 18 policy.

15:46.280 --> 15:51.280
- Oh, I wouldn't worry, he
can sleep through anything.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.320
(upbeat funky music)

15:59.480 --> 16:01.180
- Sorry, it's crazy
over here right now but

16:01.280 --> 16:03.380
I needed to warn you, Jay was here

16:03.480 --> 16:04.740
and he made a complaint to Fiona,

16:04.840 --> 16:07.380
like an official one about a rape.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.780
- What?

16:08.880 --> 16:09.740
Oh my god.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.460
- I know, like what is going on?

16:11.560 --> 16:15.660
How could this show
possibly have another R.

16:15.760 --> 16:16.980
Do you know anything about this?

16:17.080 --> 16:19.820
- No, no, I have no idea
what Jay's talking about.

16:19.920 --> 16:20.700
- [Fiona] Madison!

16:20.800 --> 16:23.580
- Shoot, I gotta go but
Fiona is on the war path

16:23.680 --> 16:25.100
and Rachel is going down

16:25.200 --> 16:26.620
so stay out of the firing line, okay.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.980
- You're saving my life, babe.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.260
I don't know what I'd do without you.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.980
(smooches)

16:33.080 --> 16:35.460
It's just not fun when it's this easy.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.640
- Alright, well, we're not done yet.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.740
Robin, hi, it's Rachel Goldberg.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.100
Listen, I don't have a lot of time

16:44.200 --> 16:47.500
and I'm putting my job on
the line even calling you.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.860
I just found out that
someone on Everlasting

16:49.960 --> 16:51.220
has lodged a complaint to the network

16:51.320 --> 16:52.900
about a rape on the show.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.860
I don't have any details,

16:53.960 --> 16:55.380
all I know is that the
network is trying to

16:55.480 --> 16:57.300
sweep it under the rug.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.420
Oh my god, thank you so much, Robin.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.820
Yeah, I just really think
the world needs to know.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.520
(Tommy scoffs)

17:09.480 --> 17:10.940
- [Chet] What's it called again?

17:11.040 --> 17:14.300
- Findom, financial dominatrix.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.140
Men give me vast sums of cash

17:16.240 --> 17:17.820
and I spend it on luxury items for myself

17:17.920 --> 17:19.180
and then I demand more.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.260
- And there's no sex?

17:20.360 --> 17:22.460
- Cash pigs get off on losing control.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.140
When I demand their money,
I remind them who's boss.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.380
It's a form of punishment.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.540
- I have an ex wife,

17:27.640 --> 17:29.740
I'm well acquainted with
that kind of punishment.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.540
Let me ask you something,

17:30.640 --> 17:33.500
how much would you say
our friend spent on you?

17:33.600 --> 17:36.220
- You know, I really can't talk specifics.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.420
It's not good business.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.300
- No, wouldn't want to violate the

17:39.400 --> 17:42.100
findom cash pig privilege.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.420
How about this?

17:43.520 --> 17:47.260
You give me the details,
I get you 10 new clients.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.360
I work in Hollywood.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.340
I know so many dirt bags
who would be so into this.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.500
- Do you really think I'm that stupid?

17:56.600 --> 17:58.760
- Well, gave it a shot, how about this?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.380
- Go into that diaper bag one more time,

18:10.480 --> 18:13.160
I'll give you something
that'll really blow your mind.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.380
- I mean, where'd we get this from?

18:15.480 --> 18:16.940
The set of Downtown
Abbey, give me a break.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.500
No, back up, go, go wider.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.500
Alright, come on people,

18:20.600 --> 18:24.060
this is the last piece of
Baby Everlasting story.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.820
Come on, let's go!

18:25.920 --> 18:27.540
- Well, I guess we can
finally break into that

18:27.640 --> 18:29.260
all important over 80 demo.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.500
- As long as it's not
another felony, I'm good.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.060
Dan, take the cheque, let's go.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.780
- Okay, 'scuse me, thank you.
- Yep.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.620
- Graham, where are you?

18:36.720 --> 18:37.460
- What, yeah, right here.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.860
- Come here, you're gonna
present this cheque to Carolyn.

18:39.960 --> 18:40.700
- Hold on a second.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.300
No one said I was gonna use a prop today.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.580
Come on, what is this, I mean,
I have my manicure this week.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.460
Really, great, fantastic.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.020
Make up, can you get me a nail
file or something, please.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.780
Okay, I want a nail file.
- No, okay, places people.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.060
(baby cooing)
Daddy loves you.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.020
- Hey Dan, get out of the shot.

18:54.120 --> 18:54.940
- Copy that.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.440
Contestants, can we have you
behind the cheque please.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.260
- No Dan,

18:57.360 --> 19:00.900
we're not going anywhere
until we get some answers.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.260
- I don't know what to tell you.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.620
- Oh, I don't know like who
was raped on Everlasting, yeah.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.860
- Oh shit.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.020
- It is all over Twitter.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.180
What the hell is going on here!

19:12.280 --> 19:13.340
- Give me that.
- Look at my phone.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.900
Hashtag rape, hashtag-
- Give me that.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.540
How the hell did Candy get a cell phone?

19:18.640 --> 19:19.380
- I have no idea.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.260
- [Candy] Who was raped?

19:20.360 --> 19:21.060
- [August] Was it Maya?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.320
- Yeah, is this what she
was talking about before

19:22.400 --> 19:23.180
or is this something new?

19:23.280 --> 19:24.820
- Yeah, is this the so-called accident

19:24.920 --> 19:26.540
Graham was rambling on about?

19:26.640 --> 19:27.780
- You must know something.

19:27.880 --> 19:28.700
- No, I don't.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.600
- [Rodrigo] You cannot
keep us in the dark.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.620
- Okay, let me just-

19:30.720 --> 19:31.480
- [Sofia] No, we demand to know the truth.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.340
- Let me, alright,
everybody just calm down.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.440
(suspenseful music)

19:39.200 --> 19:40.300
- Okay, everybody be quiet, okay,

19:40.400 --> 19:42.500
I don't have any information
for you guys right now.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.440
Alright, but the producers are meeting
so we should have some answers very soon.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.980
- Okay, so there's a rapist on set

19:48.080 --> 19:49.780
but you just can't tell us who.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.300
- Why don't I show you
some photos of my kids?

19:51.400 --> 19:52.900
- After everything that's
happened this season,

19:53.000 --> 19:53.780
we should all walk.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.700
- Yeah, you first.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.140
A million dollars up for grabs,

19:56.240 --> 19:58.460
that's more than a kindergarten
teacher makes in 100 years.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.860
- Oh, I know, honey.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.640
Nobody is going anywhere.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.660
- So now the press knows what happened.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.700
This is a disaster, Rachel.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.820
- No kidding, I mean how do you
think the network found out.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.920
We must have a mole.

20:13.520 --> 20:14.980
Where's Jay?
(Quinn sighs)

20:15.080 --> 20:15.820
- Okay, you know what,

20:15.920 --> 20:18.860
our only job is to get the
contestants under control

20:18.960 --> 20:20.900
so that we can finish
this godforsaken episode

20:21.000 --> 20:22.940
and have something to air.
- Okay.

20:23.040 --> 20:23.780
I'll go get them back-

20:23.880 --> 20:26.380
- No, you will do what
you're told, for once.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.780
Candy and August are the ringleaders,

20:27.880 --> 20:30.820
so I will talk to Candy
and get her back on board

20:30.920 --> 20:33.140
but do you think you can
handle your ex-boyfriend?

20:33.240 --> 20:34.860
- He's not my ex anymore.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.260
I know that is complicated but-

20:36.360 --> 20:37.100
- Okay, you know what,

20:37.200 --> 20:39.700
I don't have time for this
much bullshit, just go!

20:39.800 --> 20:42.360
Do your job before the
whole show implodes.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.220
(sighs)

20:45.320 --> 20:46.860
- Noelle, you do not seem like yourself,

20:46.960 --> 20:49.940
did something happen with Roger?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.580
I know you were with him.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.940
Did he do something to you?

20:53.040 --> 20:55.300
You know you can tell me, right.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.140
You can tell me anything,

20:56.240 --> 20:57.700
and I wouldn't be able to live with myself

20:57.800 --> 20:59.920
if anything like that
ever happened to you.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.260
Hey, oh, no, no.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.100
(Noelle crying)

21:05.200 --> 21:07.200
Hey, hey, hey.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.340
What?

21:09.440 --> 21:11.440
- It's just

21:12.840 --> 21:16.380
this is the first time you've
been nice to me all season.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.620
- I care about you.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.720
I do.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.940
- Rachel, I don't want
your spare me, okay.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.420
You need to tell me the truth, now.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.020
- Okay, I know but this
stays between us, okay?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.580
- Yes, okay, now.

21:28.680 --> 21:33.680
- Truth is, there was a rape
but it was three seasons ago.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.100
Roger raped Maya the first
time she was on the show.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.100
- What?
- Yes.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.740
So last night when she saw
Roger going off with Noelle,

21:43.840 --> 21:45.220
she completely snapped
and she stabbed him.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.500
- She stabbed...
- Yes.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
- She stabbed him?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.380
Oh my god, Rachel, is she okay?

21:51.480 --> 21:53.140
I mean, did anyone call the cops on this?

21:53.240 --> 21:53.980
- No, of course.
- You sure?

21:54.080 --> 21:56.080
- Yes, I've been there in the whole thing.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.180
August, this is all my fault.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.980
- What?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.420
- I mean, Maya wanted to come back here

22:05.520 --> 22:07.520
and confront Roger so badly.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.260
I mean, she literally begged
me to help her get closure.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.980
I should've just listen to
my instincts and said no.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.380
- Hey, hey, hey, listen.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.700
Hey, hey, Maya can use what Roger did

22:19.800 --> 22:21.780
in their last season as a defence, okay.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.960
- I mean, I'll testify for her.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.380
You know, anything to help Maya.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.700
- Yeah, I know.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.720
(light folk music)

22:31.960 --> 22:33.960
I'm sorry.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
I'm sorry.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.060
- Okay, Candy, listen,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.580
I am going to tell you
what really happened.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.960
- Wait, just let me get
out my B.S. detector.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.180
- There was no rape, right.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.900
It was a disgruntled employee

22:51.000 --> 22:53.100
who was looking for payout
after he was fired last-

22:53.200 --> 22:55.060
- Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.180
Oh, oh my gosh, looks like you broke it.

22:57.280 --> 23:01.860
- His faulty lighting rig
fell and hit Maya and Roger.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.220
There was minor head injuries

23:03.320 --> 23:05.140
but they were both too
shaken up to return.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.060
- Let's pretend I believe
you, which I don't,

23:07.160 --> 23:11.180
but even so, this place has
been one accident after another.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.300
First Luke and his pelvis,
and then Alexi's a cripple

23:14.400 --> 23:15.820
and now Maya and Roger

23:15.920 --> 23:17.660
get hit with like a light or whatever,

23:17.760 --> 23:19.300
if this is how you run your shows

23:19.400 --> 23:22.020
I want no part of Stripper Queens.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.200
(laughs)

23:26.800 --> 23:28.340
- You are right.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.720
You're so right, I don't
want any part of this either.

23:32.640 --> 23:37.060
I am so sick and tired of conning people

23:37.160 --> 23:39.920
and producing this utter crap,

23:41.080 --> 23:45.280
so how about we do Stripper
Queens as a scripted show,

23:46.720 --> 23:49.160
with you as the star.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.400
You know, we could do it
gritty, raw, FX style.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.980
- So I'm like an actress now?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.900
- I mean it worked for Channing Tatum.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.780
He started off shaking his junk

24:00.880 --> 24:04.580
and now he's a bonafide movie
star making 30 mil a pop.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.680
That could be you.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.620
- If what?

24:09.720 --> 24:12.120
- If you get the others back to work.

24:16.360 --> 24:21.220
- Okay, I will talk to the
others and see what I can do.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.320
- That's my girl.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.940
- Hey, Gregor, glad you could make it.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.380
- Mr. Wilton, you have a proposal for me?

24:31.480 --> 24:33.100
It will need to be significant.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.060
- Here's our proposal, we will
pay for Roger's mangled dick

24:37.160 --> 24:40.560
and your wife will never
find out about this.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.540
It's Betty, right?

24:42.640 --> 24:44.340
- [Mistress] And you're
gonna give me how much?

24:44.440 --> 24:47.180
- [Gregor] 10,000 Mistress. (snorts)

24:47.280 --> 24:49.280
- That's a good little piggy.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.780
- I'll draw up the papers.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.880
- That's a good little piggy.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.740
- Hey, can you go do final looks
on the contestants, please.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.220
Thank you.

24:59.320 --> 25:01.460
- [Noelle] Jay.
- Hey, what's up?

25:01.560 --> 25:03.760
- I think I'm ready to make a statement.

25:04.920 --> 25:05.660
I can't hide it anymore,

25:05.760 --> 25:08.000
I just want to tell the
truth about what happened.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.660
- Don't even get your coat,
let's just get you out of here.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.740
Okay, let's take you to my car.

25:12.840 --> 25:13.860
You okay?
- [Noelle] Yeah.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.540
- [Jay] Yeah?
- What the hell are you doing?

25:16.640 --> 25:18.420
- What you should've done
in the first place, Rachel,

25:18.520 --> 25:20.940
reporting that sexual
assaulting prick to the police

25:21.040 --> 25:21.820
and you know what, Rachel,

25:21.920 --> 25:24.660
if that spells the end
of this raging shit show,

25:24.760 --> 25:26.180
even better.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.460
- I mean, Noelle,

25:27.560 --> 25:30.380
I absolutely want you to
speak your truth, of course,

25:30.480 --> 25:31.980
but do you have any idea
what's going to happen to you

25:32.080 --> 25:32.820
if you come forward?

25:32.920 --> 25:34.820
- Rachel, I can't feel any
worse than I feel right now.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.500
- Trust me, you can.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.260
If you want any semblance
of a normal life,

25:38.360 --> 25:40.500
you need to turn around right now,

25:40.600 --> 25:42.700
plaster smile on that
beautiful face of yours

25:42.800 --> 25:43.780
and forget this ever happened.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.100
- Do not listen to her, Noelle.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.820
- Listen to me, the press is circling.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.100
Everything's changed.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.460
They are looking for a poster
child for victimisation,

25:50.560 --> 25:52.220
I mean, do you really want to be that girl

25:52.320 --> 25:54.860
who allowed herself to
get raped on national TV?

25:54.960 --> 25:56.020
- Allowed, are you kidding me!

25:56.120 --> 25:57.940
- Do you really want
that to be your legacy?

25:58.040 --> 26:00.180
- Oh my god, you are sick,
Rachel, you are sick.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.620
- Don't listen to him, he's not a woman,

26:01.720 --> 26:03.580
he has no idea what you're up against.

26:03.680 --> 26:04.820
- No, I can handle it.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.100
- Well, there's footage
of you falling down drunk,

26:07.200 --> 26:08.380
making out with Roger,

26:08.480 --> 26:09.900
and by the time his high-priced lawyers

26:10.000 --> 26:11.100
get finished with that,

26:11.200 --> 26:12.740
you're not gonna be America's sweetheart,

26:12.840 --> 26:14.540
you're gonna be the
slut who had it coming.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.580
- Noelle, there is a whole
world of people out there

26:17.680 --> 26:19.180
who are gonna believe you,
okay honey, I promise-

26:19.280 --> 26:21.340
- Oh please, America
doesn't want to believe you.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.540
I can count on one hand the
number of high powered men

26:23.640 --> 26:26.340
whose careers didn't rebound
within six months of scandal

26:26.440 --> 26:28.860
after laying low in some
bullshit Malibu rehab.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.180
Face it, you're playing a
rigged game with a losing hand

26:31.280 --> 26:33.420
and the only person who's
gonna get hurt in this,

26:33.520 --> 26:35.180
is you, again.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.180
(Noelle sobbing)

26:37.280 --> 26:38.380
Unless you trust me,

26:38.480 --> 26:41.260
I can make sure that
footage never gets out.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.940
Okay, I can do that for
you, that is a promise.

26:44.040 --> 26:47.340
- Rachel, we need to talk,

26:47.440 --> 26:48.340
right now.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.440
(suspenseful music)

26:55.200 --> 26:57.220
- Oh my god, I would never
do something like that.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.780
Hey Madison, you know my history,

26:58.880 --> 27:00.460
I would never put anyone else through

27:00.560 --> 27:01.460
what I went through, right.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.500
- I hope not.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.780
- This isn't about
whatever happened to you,

27:04.880 --> 27:07.740
this is about what happened
here last night on this show.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.060
- Okay, well, what happened last night

27:09.160 --> 27:11.060
was absolutely horrible but

27:11.160 --> 27:12.580
all of us from the floor producing,

27:12.680 --> 27:14.900
I mean, there was a literal
baby being born in the courtyard

27:15.000 --> 27:16.340
and the second that we heard the screams

27:16.440 --> 27:17.700
we all ran into the control room.

27:17.800 --> 27:18.740
- That's not even true.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.300
- I have the proof, Jay.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.580
Roger couldn't have been doing

27:21.680 --> 27:23.220
what he was doing for very long

27:23.320 --> 27:25.320
Come, look at the tape.

27:32.440 --> 27:33.500
- It's okay.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.380
(Noelle moaning)

27:36.480 --> 27:37.820
- Get off of her now!

27:37.920 --> 27:38.980
- You're crazy, what are you doing?

27:39.080 --> 27:40.700
(Maya screaming)

27:40.800 --> 27:42.060
- Rachel, what have you done?

27:42.160 --> 27:44.160
- You doctored the footage.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.400
- How do you know that?

27:52.280 --> 27:55.420
- We were all in the control
room, we saw everything.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.660
We came in and Roger was on top of Noelle,

27:57.760 --> 28:00.620
she was barely conscious and
Rachel was just watching,

28:00.720 --> 28:02.500
she was letting it all happen.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.340
- You were there,

28:03.440 --> 28:05.700
you knew about this and
did nothing to stop it.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.300
- I tried, okay,

28:07.400 --> 28:09.980
Jay ran into the room as soon
as we saw what was happening.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.540
- And then you send him
to lie to me about it

28:12.640 --> 28:14.700
and say you knew nothing.

28:14.800 --> 28:15.940
What the hell happened here, Quinn?

28:16.040 --> 28:17.620
You have completely lost control.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.120
- Oh, this is on me?
- You're damn right it is.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.400
I can't believe I'm saying this.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.140
We're going with the doctor tape.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.140
- You can't be serious.

28:27.240 --> 28:30.200
- If we don't, what
the hell are we saying?

28:35.720 --> 28:37.300
We need this cut in an
hour to make it to air.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.340
- You don't have to air that footage,

28:39.440 --> 28:42.100
we have more than enough
story with the birth footage.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.680
- The press knows something happened.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.700
They've already heard the word rape.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.540
Now we have to explain it,

28:48.640 --> 28:51.020
we have to give it to them
in a way that it makes sense

28:51.120 --> 28:53.620
but also doesn't leave us
with our asses hanging out.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.720
- I have just the thing.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.340
- Then get it done.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.800
(Jay sighs)

29:01.280 --> 29:04.700
- Oh, and can I get that
Baby Everlasting footage,

29:04.800 --> 29:06.580
I think it'd make a
great runner, you know,

29:06.680 --> 29:09.720
or exclusive web content
at the very least.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.040
(tense music)

29:17.160 --> 29:19.160
- Madison, you okay?

29:20.640 --> 29:22.380
- Just answer me honestly,

29:22.480 --> 29:24.760
were you in that room
watching with Rachel?

29:26.040 --> 29:27.180
- Oh my god, no.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.020
No, I was horrified when I heard about it.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.420
- Okay.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.620
Just be careful with Rachel.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.980
She sucks people in and she's dangerous.

29:38.080 --> 29:38.980
- Yeah, you're right.

29:39.080 --> 29:43.440
I've never met anyone like
her in my life and that's...

29:45.200 --> 29:47.200
It's terrifying.

29:51.160 --> 29:54.080
(upbeat pop music)

30:01.560 --> 30:03.100
- What is this place?

30:03.200 --> 30:05.100
- This is Rachel Goldberg's fan club.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.100
- Welcome, don't forget your cards.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.860
Winner gets their tab picked up

30:08.960 --> 30:11.620
and you have to drink everytime
Graham says Everlasting.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.420
(both laugh)
- Alright.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.620
- Have fun.

30:14.720 --> 30:15.540
- Amazing.

30:15.640 --> 30:19.220
There's August, and Anna, wow,
that dress is so impressive.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.260
Is that Mary?

30:21.360 --> 30:22.780
- Oh, I think it's dead Mary.

30:22.880 --> 30:23.620
- Holy shit.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.700
- Who do you guys think did it?

30:24.800 --> 30:26.700
- I don't know but they
better not jerk us around

30:26.800 --> 30:28.860
and not show us anything
or I will lose it.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.240
- Oh my god, the fans have demands.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.080
- This is all because of you.

30:34.840 --> 30:35.580
It's all you.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.420
- [Announcer] Due to the graphic
nature of this programme,

30:37.520 --> 30:38.940
viewer discretion is advised.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.700
(patrons cheer and applaud)

30:40.800 --> 30:42.780
- Tonight, on Everlasting.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.560
(patrons cheer)

30:47.160 --> 30:48.460
- You just feel guilty we hooked up

30:48.560 --> 30:49.880
because you were supposed
to be on the show for Adam.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.140
- You cheated on the suitor?
- No!

30:51.240 --> 30:52.940
(patrons boo)
- This is effed up.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.020
(sirens wailing)

30:54.120 --> 30:55.620
- [Roger] This feels like a witch hunt.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.660
(Maya and Roger screaming)

30:57.760 --> 30:58.940
Help me!

30:59.040 --> 30:59.780
(patrons cheer)

30:59.880 --> 31:01.100
- [Graham] It all happens tonight,

31:01.200 --> 31:03.940
on this very special
episode of Everlasting.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.820
(patrons cheer)

31:05.920 --> 31:08.100
- [Female Patron One] Drink up.

31:08.200 --> 31:12.300
- I know all of you
have heard the rumours,

31:12.400 --> 31:15.100
but tonight we're going to
tell you the real story.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.300
A story of love, lust, obsession,

31:17.400 --> 31:19.940
violent delights and violent ends,

31:20.040 --> 31:22.620
but first, let's take a look
back at where it all started.

31:22.720 --> 31:26.580
A little game we called
eggs marks the spot.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.940
Who does Roger think

31:28.040 --> 31:31.020
will wind up living alone with eight cats?

31:31.120 --> 31:31.900
- Maya.

31:32.000 --> 31:32.700
- [Jack] Maya.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.800
- The show's trending nationwide.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.460
Everybody wants to know
what happened, this is huge.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.380
- You see fun-loving, party boy Roger

31:39.480 --> 31:40.620
was introduced to us

31:40.720 --> 31:42.820
as the friend of then
suitor, Adam Cromwell,

31:42.920 --> 31:44.540
and Roger caught the attention

31:44.640 --> 31:46.640
of one lovely lady right away

31:47.280 --> 31:49.220
and the suitor couldn't compete.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.060
- To...
- Good company.

31:51.160 --> 31:51.860
(patrons cheer)

31:51.960 --> 31:53.740
- Maya came back to Everlasting All Stars

31:53.840 --> 31:55.660
looking for another chance at love

31:55.760 --> 31:57.300
with our roguish gentlemen

31:57.400 --> 31:59.820
but it was evident early
on that her interest in him

31:59.920 --> 32:03.140
was unhealthy to say the least.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.220
- She's had something going
on since she got here.

32:05.320 --> 32:09.140
And with Roger, something
about him really got to her.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.580
- But alas, Roger wished
to sow his wild oats.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.420
(patrons cheer)

32:12.520 --> 32:14.100
- [Female Patron Two] Hey Roger.

32:14.200 --> 32:14.940
(Rachel laughs)

32:15.040 --> 32:16.160
- [Graham] And this
rebuff seemed to only fuel

32:16.240 --> 32:17.940
Maya's dark passions further.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.380
- Maya was like full-on
obsessed with Roger.

32:20.480 --> 32:25.340
- I know damaged girls and
she is for sure one of them.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.540
- I'm surprised he didn't end up

32:26.640 --> 32:28.500
in little Tupperware
containers in her freezer.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.580
- And it was at this moment,
something inside Maya snapped.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.780
- Here we go.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.820
- And she decided to take
matters into our own hands.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.460
- Get off of her now!

32:37.560 --> 32:38.300
(patrons exclaim)

32:38.400 --> 32:40.980
- [Graham] She believed that
if she couldn't have him,

32:41.080 --> 32:42.620
then no one could.

32:42.720 --> 32:45.460
- Help me!
(patrons exclaim)

32:45.560 --> 32:47.300
- They love it.
- Yeah.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.580
- You see America, here at Everlasting,

32:49.680 --> 32:52.780
we do everything we can
to protect the safety

32:52.880 --> 32:55.060
and security of each
one of our contestants,

32:55.160 --> 32:57.160
but sometimes we are reminded

32:58.280 --> 33:00.360
that true evil does exist in this world,

33:01.840 --> 33:06.500
and sometimes sadly that evil wins.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.260
- Turn this crap off, will ya?

33:08.360 --> 33:10.140
- I can't.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.460
- Look, this is not on you.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.560
This is on Rachel.

33:22.840 --> 33:23.580
(shutter clicks)

33:23.680 --> 33:25.680
- We're doing Stripper Queens scripted.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.640
I want out.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.620
- [Female Patron Three]
Your life's over, bitch.

33:30.720 --> 33:31.980
- [Female Patron Four] Bye bye, Maya.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.860
- How did you get Maya's
perp walk on camera,

33:33.960 --> 33:36.340
I mean, Quinn completely barred
cameras from the driveway.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.440
- That's Linda in props.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.180
Dead ringer from the back, right.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.020
- Nice.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.360
- [Sofia] She saw Noelle and
Roger starting to hook up

33:42.440 --> 33:45.500
and she went all Fatal Attraction on them.

33:45.600 --> 33:49.300
- [Man] Oh my god. (all laughing)

33:49.400 --> 33:52.000
(sombre music)

33:54.760 --> 33:56.100
- Here comes your money shot.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.700
- Roger and I were having a great time,

33:57.800 --> 33:58.940
we were getting intimate

33:59.040 --> 34:01.940
and all of a sudden Maya
bursts in with a knife.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.580
It was so scary.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.740
I mean, I don't know, maybe she was angry

34:05.840 --> 34:07.660
that Roger wasn't into her anymore so

34:07.760 --> 34:09.820
she made up these insane rape allegations

34:09.920 --> 34:12.980
to excuse her actions, but I forgive her.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.760
(patrons cheer)

34:16.920 --> 34:18.920
- You're a genius.

34:19.680 --> 34:22.100
- I wanna put this whole
nasty mess behind me.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.940
I just hope Maya gets the
help she clearly needs.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.780
- In cell block D, mate.

34:26.880 --> 34:31.140
- [Patrons] Lock her up,
lock her up, lock her up,

34:31.240 --> 34:33.320
lock her up, lock her up.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.020
- I'm gonna be right back.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.140
I'll be right back.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.580
(door slams)

34:39.680 --> 34:43.000
(retching and coughing)

34:44.400 --> 34:46.880
(tense music)

35:08.520 --> 35:10.340
Hey.

35:10.440 --> 35:11.500
- All good?

35:11.600 --> 35:12.820
- Great.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.920
- Another round?
- Absolutely.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.080
(suspenseful music)

35:26.640 --> 35:28.800
- Hey, how you doing, you okay?

35:30.000 --> 35:31.340
- It will be, yeah.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.980
- Look, I know things have
been really messed up, Rach,

35:34.080 --> 35:36.420
but look everything, hey, hey, hey,

35:36.520 --> 35:39.500
everything's getting back to
normal with the contestants.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.600
Maya's gonna be okay.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.640
She's so lucky to have you, Rachel.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.060
- Thanks.

35:47.160 --> 35:50.080
(melancholy music)

35:54.480 --> 35:58.020
- Well, the overnights are in.

35:58.120 --> 36:01.900
Best numbers we've seen in
seven years, a 20 share.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.720
That's World Series numbers,
nobody does that anymore.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.780
Looks like the board is over the moon

36:07.880 --> 36:08.940
- And you have no problem

36:09.040 --> 36:10.940
with what Rachel did to make this happen.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.700
- I have a huge problem with that,

36:12.800 --> 36:14.540
but we sold some cars and lady razors

36:14.640 --> 36:15.980
and that's all the board cares about.

36:16.080 --> 36:19.140
Like it or not, Rachel
cleaned up this mess for you.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.780
- By taking a rape victim

36:20.880 --> 36:23.020
and turning her into a psychotic bitch.

36:23.120 --> 36:26.240
- (laughs) Oh my god, after
everything you've done?

36:27.960 --> 36:29.940
Quinn King is finally drawning a line.

36:30.040 --> 36:33.180
- Yes, I am, this is the line.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.780
Rachel is out of control and you know it.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.300
- So?

36:37.400 --> 36:39.100
Fire her.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.100
That's what this whole
thing's been about, right?

36:41.200 --> 36:43.460
You sending Jay to me so I do it for you,

36:43.560 --> 36:46.220
'cause you're too chicken shit
to pull the trigger yourself.

36:46.320 --> 36:49.420
She learned her bag of tricks from you.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.060
You created this.

36:51.160 --> 36:56.140
So, if you feel like she
crossed a line, fire her.

36:56.240 --> 36:59.240
(suspenseful music)

37:02.880 --> 37:04.880
Hmm.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.980
(Quinn sighs)

37:13.080 --> 37:14.340
- I thought this would be relaxing.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.020
- (laughs) Nah, you'll get there, mate.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.300
So come up.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.340
You know, yoga's more about
being centred and mindful,

37:21.440 --> 37:24.440
and I reckon we could all use
a bit of that after this week.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.160
- Truthfully I'd rather just leave.

37:29.000 --> 37:29.980
Be done with this whole thing,

37:30.080 --> 37:32.380
but Rachel thinks I should stick it out.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.020
- Yeah, she can be pretty
convincing, Rachel.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.120
- Yeah.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.260
Don't tell anyone but

37:40.360 --> 37:43.440
Rachel and I have been
having kind of a thing.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.140
She thinks I should play for the million,

37:46.240 --> 37:47.700
but I don't know,

37:47.800 --> 37:49.340
pretending to date someone on TV

37:49.440 --> 37:51.580
while your heart's with someone else,

37:51.680 --> 37:53.680
doesn't seem right, does it?

37:54.360 --> 37:57.200
- No, mate, no, that
doesn't seem right at all.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.700
- Hey Rachel, you got a minute?

38:01.800 --> 38:04.140
I wanna talk to you.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.240
- Yeah.

38:08.080 --> 38:11.060
- So, Noelle was with Roger.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.500
I thought something bad
happened, that he did something,

38:13.600 --> 38:16.100
but no, she just picked another man,

38:16.200 --> 38:18.720
so forget her, I want you.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.220
- Yeah, I have to work.

38:21.320 --> 38:24.100
- No, no, no.
- I'm sorry, so sorry.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.200
I'm sorry.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.880
(sombre music)

38:41.680 --> 38:43.680
- Hey, are you okay?

38:46.560 --> 38:48.260
- No.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.360
No, I really don't think I am.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.680
(light music)

39:09.680 --> 39:12.100
- You wanted to see me?
- Congratulations.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.540
- On what, the ratings?

39:13.640 --> 39:16.080
- No, on producing me.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.420
You wanted me to go to the
network or to get Jay to

39:20.520 --> 39:22.980
all so you could leak it to the press.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.300
- And?

39:24.400 --> 39:26.900
- All of this was to force my hand

39:27.000 --> 39:29.140
so that you could show the
footage and tell the story

39:29.240 --> 39:31.180
or whatever bastardised version

39:31.280 --> 39:32.620
you could actually cobble together.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.420
- Well, the only thing I didn't
know is if you would do it.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.740
I mean, if you were willing
to sacrifice me for the show.

39:38.840 --> 39:42.040
I got my answer.
- I was trying to save you.

39:44.200 --> 39:47.680
(sighs) This is not who you are, Rachel.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.820
All the terrible things that
have happened in your life.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.940
you can dye your hair any colour you want,

39:55.040 --> 39:56.860
but there is a conscience in there

39:56.960 --> 39:59.000
and you can not shove it down forever.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.240
(folk music)

40:21.840 --> 40:22.740
- You want to get out of here?

40:22.840 --> 40:24.820
Scout locations for the finale.

40:24.920 --> 40:26.920
I mean, we could take the weekend.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.420
- Yeah, I really wish I could,

40:30.520 --> 40:34.880
but I made plans with Madison already, so.

40:36.080 --> 40:36.780
- Oh really?

40:36.880 --> 40:39.360
Good for you, that sounds
like so much more fun.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
See you in five.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.280
- So

40:59.840 --> 41:02.020
scouting, huh.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.120
- Yeah.

41:08.720 --> 41:11.720
(intense pop music)

41:32.120 --> 41:34.600
(tense music)
