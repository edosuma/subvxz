00:01.871 --> 00:02.654
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:02.698 --> 00:03.916
I will raise the dark one.

00:03.960 --> 00:05.048
Yes.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.050
And then I will carve out
his heart.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.878
Here goes everything.

00:09.618 --> 00:10.836
Don't follow me.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.882
As if I'd leave you on your own.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.492
He is found with her.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.146
She returns to the crypt.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.237
Julius!

00:20.281 --> 00:22.283
Frankie!

00:22.326 --> 00:23.936
You wanna walk
to Renfield House?

00:23.980 --> 00:25.547
I've gotta be there for Vanessa
whether she wants me to or not.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.897
Only one can make it to the end.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.942
I make my own fate.

01:23.692 --> 01:32.875
Mohamad... my Mohamad.

01:34.746 --> 01:38.010
I found you.

01:50.371 --> 01:56.333
You're a part of me,
heart and soul.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.208
Bad dream?

02:56.263 --> 02:59.527
So there's no way you could
have prevented Caitlyn's death?

02:59.570 --> 03:00.919
No.

03:00.963 --> 03:03.357
The vampire bit her
before I could do anything.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.750
By the time I got my gun
it was too late.

03:05.794 --> 03:08.231
Why didn't you report it
straight away?

03:08.275 --> 03:09.580
It wasn't exactly a priority.

03:09.624 --> 03:12.714
The whole city was in chaos.

03:12.757 --> 03:16.413
I don't know.
Maybe I was scared.

03:16.457 --> 03:17.588
I got the hell out of there.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.503
I mean, I could have been
killed, too.

03:19.547 --> 03:24.029
You know what I can't work out?

03:24.073 --> 03:27.903
How this vampire got in here
in the first place.

03:27.946 --> 03:36.477
It's uh... it's odd,
don't you think?

03:39.306 --> 03:42.918
We lost a whole sector
of the city to vampires.

03:42.961 --> 03:47.618
If that can fail,
who knows what else?

03:47.662 --> 03:49.490
Hmm.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.671
No, I gotta give it to you.

03:56.714 --> 04:00.283
It's so effortless for you.

04:00.327 --> 04:06.463
Not even a hint of remorse
in your eyes.

04:06.507 --> 04:09.727
We didn't catch anything
on that CCTV in the hallway

04:09.771 --> 04:16.430
but we buried one in the wall.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.301
Caitlyn didn't trust you.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.868
She would have told you
that herself

04:19.911 --> 04:23.175
but you found this very unique
way of keeping her quiet.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.569
Ok, look, look. She was
blackmailing me, ok?

04:25.613 --> 04:26.831
You don't understand-

04:26.875 --> 04:29.660
Sit the 치*치치*치 down.

04:34.056 --> 04:37.277
All that matters now
is what we do with you.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.584
Ok.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.716
Just send me to Love Land.

04:41.759 --> 04:42.760
Love Land.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.329
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

04:46.373 --> 04:49.724
Unfortunately you're still
too valuable for me here.

04:49.767 --> 04:50.942
How?

04:50.986 --> 04:53.641
Well, we have this little
vampire problem,

04:53.684 --> 04:58.820
and since you are the supposed
expert you're gonna solve it.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.823
Assuming you ever wanna
see your girlfriend again.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.185
Vanessa...

05:17.665 --> 05:20.189
Vanessa...

05:22.626 --> 05:27.936
Vanessa Van Helsing, destiny...

05:27.979 --> 05:30.155
Turn around.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.723
Face me.

05:35.987 --> 05:41.602
I sense something so sweet,
yet sour.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.522
Love those eyes.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.890
I have a destiny.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.240
So do I.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.989
You have become stronger
than before.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.600
What have you become?

06:23.644 --> 06:26.298
The end of you.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.822
Perhaps.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.651
But what have you done
to become this?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.015
Nighty night.

06:59.375 --> 07:03.031
The darkness summoned you.

07:07.557 --> 07:15.217
But from two only one may be.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.392
Only one?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.394
One what?

07:18.438 --> 07:21.876
Liege to the dark one.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.052
An elder.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.489
Him, or...

07:26.533 --> 07:27.621
Me.

07:27.664 --> 07:32.364
Oh yes.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.410
You're not the fourth elder.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.499
So close.

07:36.543 --> 07:43.288
Close enough to see,
and yet still so blind.

07:43.332 --> 07:48.468
There is no fourth elder,
yet.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.991
But the prophecy.

07:50.034 --> 07:50.948
My mother...

07:50.992 --> 07:53.385
What's wrong?

07:53.429 --> 07:59.174
What truth they never told was
about the fourth.

07:59.217 --> 08:05.746
The fourth must be made.

08:34.252 --> 08:38.779
And now here you are.

08:42.565 --> 08:46.047
I don't believe you.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.617
In your heart you know
the truth,

08:50.660 --> 08:57.754
but you wish not to see
what you must see.

08:57.798 --> 09:04.631
See we shall, know we will.

09:53.680 --> 10:00.077
This compound of yours
is going to work, right?

10:00.121 --> 10:02.906
It's 20 times stronger
in concentration.

10:02.950 --> 10:06.910
You asked for a Hail Mary,
this is the best that I've got.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.653
Excuse me, I need
to check this.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.220
No, no, no.
You're coming with us.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.264
No, you don't understand.

10:13.308 --> 10:13.700
This is the work
I've been working-

10:13.743 --> 10:14.744
Now.

11:30.211 --> 11:34.345
I've been here before.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.391
But it was different.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.051
All will become clear.

11:44.094 --> 11:48.403
You will see and know
everything.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.448
I don't need clarity.

11:50.492 --> 11:53.060
The truth is clear now
more than ever.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.288
Tell me.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.595
Then tell me what must
be done.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.510
The totems.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.774
You have yours?

12:11.818 --> 12:18.389
All I have is this.

12:18.433 --> 12:21.566
Symbol of your pain.

12:21.610 --> 12:24.831
Your suffering.

12:24.874 --> 12:31.402
Made in darkness from darkness.

12:31.446 --> 12:34.710
Yes, this will do.

12:35.842 --> 12:39.019
And you.

12:39.062 --> 12:41.848
One from your kindred.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.938
But more.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.418
The ring of the B'ah.

12:47.462 --> 12:51.031
The bracelet of of Abaddon.

12:51.074 --> 12:58.081
Defeated them and stole theirs,
didn't you?

12:58.125 --> 13:02.390
Now all I need is Sam's,

13:02.433 --> 13:04.740
and his path to darkness ends.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.482
And what of yours?

13:07.525 --> 13:09.527
Crafted one, did you?

13:09.571 --> 13:11.138
This wasn't my path.

13:11.181 --> 13:15.272
Was always.

13:15.316 --> 13:23.150
And you have it now even if you
do not see it for what it is.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.284
Give that back.

13:27.328 --> 13:28.938
Precious.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.897
Special.

13:30.940 --> 13:35.858
A symbol of your pain,
as are they all.

13:35.902 --> 13:42.865
Offerings so beholden you
may become to the dark one.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.432
I'll never become an elder.

13:44.475 --> 13:49.785
This path you have always walked
towards your true purpose.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.875
Which begins and ends
with killing all of you.

13:52.919 --> 13:59.795
Blind still, and yet drawn
to this you are.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.580
Always were.

14:02.624 --> 14:07.455
All you need to do is embrace
your true nature.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.545
I'll never be like you.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.286
Or him.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.897
Still you choose blindness!

14:14.941 --> 14:17.987
All your life I have watched you
walk a path

14:18.031 --> 14:21.208
you didn't know you were on.

14:21.251 --> 14:26.256
Open your eyes!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.916
I'll never join you.

14:33.960 --> 14:38.965
If not you then him.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.531
One will.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.446
Yes.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.796
Let it be me.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.975
Let it be me!

14:49.018 --> 14:54.023
Then you know what must be done.

15:12.737 --> 15:15.479
So the security gate
wasn't breached.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.091
There's been no sign of vampires
for the last 48 hours

15:18.134 --> 15:22.225
so I think what makes most sense
is we hold fast.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.227
Wait for help to arrive.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.098
From where?

15:25.141 --> 15:26.534
We called in reinforcements.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.144
That's all you need to know.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.668
Reinfor- no, you don't get it.
We need to go in there now.

15:30.712 --> 15:31.843
That's too risky.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.410
Listen to me.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.064
On the other side of that fence
they're figuring out a way

15:35.108 --> 15:37.240
to get in here and
kill the rest of you.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.373
They don't have that
level of sophistication.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.374
They're ferals.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.853
No. Not ferals.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.420
Not anymore.
They're daywalkers.

15:43.464 --> 15:47.033
Smart, tactical, harder to kill,
and to top it off

15:47.076 --> 15:48.817
they're immune to the sun now.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.340
Oh shit.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.559
They walked right through
the UV lights in quarantine

15:51.602 --> 15:53.300
like they weren't even there.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.475
That's right.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.172
No, we have to take
the fight to them.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.608
That's all that matters.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.175
He's right.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.611
We wait and they can figure out
a way around our defences

16:00.655 --> 16:02.962
and then game over.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.180
Are you sure we're up to this?

16:04.224 --> 16:05.486
What if we don't have enough
fire power?

16:05.529 --> 16:07.053
We do now.

16:07.096 --> 16:11.927
Ammo tipped with concentrate
and aluminium silicate.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.102
The hell is that?

16:13.146 --> 16:14.669
A poison I engineered.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.366
It's made from the same base
chemical Black Tech

16:16.410 --> 16:18.325
was using in your repellant.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.501
Weaponized against vampires.

16:20.544 --> 16:23.504
So in theory a concentrated dose
of the chemical that repels them

16:23.547 --> 16:25.245
could also poison them.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.290
Maybe even kill them.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.683
In theory.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.685
Has any of this been tested?

16:30.728 --> 16:31.860
At all?

16:31.903 --> 16:33.601
You wanna wait while
we conduct trials?

16:33.644 --> 16:35.037
Yeah, go ahead.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.344
We'll all be dead by the time
the results come in.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.694
I'll take a squad of men
through the gate.

16:39.737 --> 16:42.523
Two other teams can enter
here and here.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.699
Any vampires in the area,
we open fire,

16:44.742 --> 16:46.396
kill as many as we can.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.224
Rescue any human survivors.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.878
We'll need volunteers.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.575
Three teams lead by me.

16:51.619 --> 16:52.794
I'll do it.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.014
What? Julius, you
don't have to do this.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.842
Yes I do. For Frankie.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.516
You sure about this?

17:19.560 --> 17:22.258
We missed something
the first time.

17:22.302 --> 17:24.391
I didn't miss anything.

17:24.434 --> 17:28.351
I also killed Captain Forehead
and uh... the Susan elder.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.353
Yeah?

17:30.397 --> 17:32.834
Where are the bodies?

17:32.877 --> 17:35.228
Uh, someone must have
taken them.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.360
Or some thing.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.929
Well, why is she still here?

17:40.972 --> 17:43.758
I don't think that psychic
vampire was trapped.

17:43.801 --> 17:46.369
I think it was sent to be
a guardian.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.849
By who?

17:47.892 --> 17:49.198
And to guard what? Lily?

17:49.242 --> 17:51.200
I don't know.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.898
Something brought her back here
all those years ago

17:53.942 --> 17:58.468
and it's brought Vanessa
back here, too.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.731
You think Vanessa's
here already?

18:00.775 --> 18:03.865
I don't think so, I know.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.649
The maze in the book.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.304
Whatever Jacob told her
on the island.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.132
See, now I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.873
There's a feeling in this place.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.049
A darkness.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.312
I think it called out to her.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.270
How would you know that?

18:17.313 --> 18:19.098
Because I feel it.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.361
But every part of me wants to
run and get the hell outta here.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.449
Well, trust your gut.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.104
No, I can't.

18:25.147 --> 18:29.108
I can't. I really I feel like
I'm meant to be here too.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.937
You can go.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.983
You don't have to stay.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.985
Really?

18:37.028 --> 18:39.466
And let the wonder twins
have all the fun?

18:39.509 --> 18:40.771
That's not gonna happen.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.208
You know the deal.

18:42.251 --> 18:44.558
It's you and me to the end,
babe.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.608
That cross.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.523
It's upside down.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.699
Oh shit.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.571
That can't be good.

18:58.354 --> 19:06.232
More steps on this path you
cannot take without this.

19:06.275 --> 19:09.931
There is no other way.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.019
Sam, don't.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.239
You could have stopped this!

19:13.282 --> 19:16.285
But you choose to reject
the gift I offer,

19:16.329 --> 19:21.029
and so it must be.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.727
Vanessa.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.080
Sam.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.478
You leave them alone.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.742
And offerings you have
brought me.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.004
You shouldn't have followed me.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.658
You left me.

19:41.702 --> 19:42.833
You need me.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.052
Scarlett.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.272
You need me to help
you fight the dark.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.839
It's what our mother
warned us about.

19:48.883 --> 19:53.148
Ah, sister of yours, she is.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.237
And this one?

19:55.281 --> 19:58.197
A handsome sacrifice.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.286
What the hell is this?

20:00.329 --> 20:02.810
A new beginning.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.855
Or the end.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.206
Both.

20:09.730 --> 20:14.735
Mohamad... Mohamad...

20:14.778 --> 20:16.519
Do as you must.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.869
Complete the prophecy.

20:18.913 --> 20:22.003
Purge the light from your heart.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.702
Mohamad!

20:25.746 --> 20:27.574
No-

20:30.185 --> 20:32.318
Mohamad.

20:32.361 --> 20:35.408
Mohamad.

20:35.451 --> 20:38.759
My Mohamad, you must stay.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.979
Stay with me.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.981
Wha- what is this?

20:44.025 --> 20:44.852
Where are we?

20:44.895 --> 20:47.246
Together.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.552
Like it was always meant to be.

20:49.596 --> 20:50.553
No.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.468
You turned me.

20:52.512 --> 20:56.907
You wanted me to be a monster
like you.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.605
I know.

20:58.648 --> 20:59.693
But I'm not.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.608
I know.

21:01.651 --> 21:07.091
You left me in a hole
to die.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.572
But I didn't die,
did I, Sam?

21:09.616 --> 21:10.704
I wouldn't.

21:10.747 --> 21:11.748
I know.

21:15.317 --> 21:19.713
But she- she saved me.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.803
She brought me back.

21:22.846 --> 21:26.937
She gave me another chance.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.939
I know.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.985
So you see, Sam.

21:31.028 --> 21:34.336
I don't belong to you.

21:34.380 --> 21:38.732
I belong to no one.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.432
Mohamad.

21:43.476 --> 21:49.743
Strong, good Mohamad.

21:49.786 --> 21:54.356
You taught me to see
who I truly was.

21:54.400 --> 22:02.712
To understand my true purpose.

22:02.756 --> 22:06.803
And to feel love.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.892
I do.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.984
I did.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.770
I hated you for that.

22:16.813 --> 22:20.687
For making me human.

22:25.169 --> 22:28.695
I feel your heart beating.

22:28.738 --> 22:32.176
My heart's beating, too.

22:32.220 --> 22:41.490
But not with pity or shame or...
or regret.

22:51.674 --> 22:55.243
Love is something I wasn't
meant to know.

22:55.286 --> 23:00.422
Love and light are not
my destiny.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.469
They are a lie.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.515
I hate you too, you lying
son of a bitch.

23:06.559 --> 23:13.217
I hope you die slowly,
painfully, and alone.

23:13.261 --> 23:16.264
And I wish I was the one
to do it.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.353
I know.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.487
But this is who I am.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.054
Who I've always been.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.709
In the shadow of darkness.

23:38.547 --> 23:42.290
You're not alone, Mohamad.

23:42.333 --> 23:45.206
You're not alone.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.904
You're not alone.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.950
You're not alone.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.913
You are not alone, Mohamad?

24:03.137 --> 24:05.313
Mohamad?

24:40.435 --> 24:47.398
I feel nothing now.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.361
Julius, listen to me.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.449
We need to get out of here.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.494
Now.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.844
Find Jolene, find Flesh,
and go.

24:57.887 --> 24:58.888
Not before I do this.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.456
You don't know what I did.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.502
They're gonna make me pay.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.981
So I just need to go back
to the lab,

25:05.025 --> 25:06.461
get the results from
my gene sequencer

25:06.505 --> 25:07.506
and get out of here, ok?

25:07.549 --> 25:08.550
Doc, this isn't about you.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.725
This is a suicide mission!

25:09.769 --> 25:11.205
Shhh!

25:11.248 --> 25:13.207
What're you gonna do?
Murder yourself?

25:13.250 --> 25:14.774
For Frankie?

25:14.817 --> 25:17.777
I don't know if she's even dead
or one of them now.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.823
Either way, it wasn't
your fault.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.085
Isn't it?

25:22.129 --> 25:22.912
No.

25:22.956 --> 25:23.957
I made Scab.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.567
I'm the one that turned him,

25:25.611 --> 25:29.353
and he couldn't have bit her
if it wasn't- no.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.486
I gotta make this right.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.705
You stubborn son of a bitch.

25:32.748 --> 25:33.575
Ok.

25:35.142 --> 25:35.969
Ok.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.972
But you come back alive, ok?

25:39.015 --> 25:40.016
Alive.

25:42.845 --> 25:45.326
What're you gonna do?

25:45.369 --> 25:47.720
Finish what I started.

25:59.775 --> 26:02.473
Stay sharp and in formation.

26:02.517 --> 26:05.520
Sweep the roads before we clear the buildings.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.043
First sign of trouble,
look to me.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.088
Understood?

26:23.190 --> 26:30.110
And so the light in you
is no more.

26:30.153 --> 26:34.114
You're heart is dark.

26:34.157 --> 26:36.029
Empty.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.509
Pure.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.034
It is nearly done.

26:41.077 --> 26:45.908
Unless Vanessa embraces
who she truly is.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.871
I'll kill you, Sam.

26:51.914 --> 26:54.308
I'll rip out your heart!

26:54.351 --> 26:55.526
Yes.

26:55.570 --> 26:56.527
Yes, good.

26:56.571 --> 26:57.485
Let in the darkness.

26:57.528 --> 26:58.355
Join us.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.574
Vanessa, don't!

26:59.618 --> 27:02.011
You won't win.

27:02.055 --> 27:06.799
I won't let you become elder,
even if I have to myself.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.148
Yes.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.279
Yes!

27:09.323 --> 27:11.151
No, Vanessa! Listen to me!

27:11.194 --> 27:12.761
You have to fight it.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.111
Fight the rage, ok?

27:15.155 --> 27:16.547
Like they taught you in China.

27:16.591 --> 27:19.159
You have to fight it.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.901
You can't become an elder.

27:21.944 --> 27:25.861
You won't defeat me

27:25.905 --> 27:33.826
because a light in your heart
still lives.

27:33.869 --> 27:37.394
Are you prepared to do
what I did?

27:37.438 --> 27:40.615
To snuff out the light
in your heart?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.573
Vanessa, you have to do it.

27:42.617 --> 27:44.053
It's the only way to stop him.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.707
To stop all of them.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.143
What?

27:51.974 --> 27:54.107
You knew back at the lighthouse

27:54.150 --> 27:56.892
that you were the only one
who could face this.

27:56.936 --> 28:00.853
It was your destiny, but what
we both didn't understand...

28:00.896 --> 28:03.769
I was made to make
that possible.

28:03.812 --> 28:07.250
I'm the only way
that you can stop him.

28:07.294 --> 28:08.774
That's my destiny.

28:08.817 --> 28:12.386
Scarlett, what the hell
are you talking about?

28:12.429 --> 28:14.736
I met someone who told me
that I had a purpose

28:14.780 --> 28:18.522
that I didn't understand.

28:18.566 --> 28:21.264
I understand it now.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.658
I wasn't meant to come here
to stop you from going dark.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.879
I was meant to give you
the strength to resist it.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.750
You don't have to do this alone.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.273
What're you talking about?

28:30.317 --> 28:31.884
This is insane.

28:31.927 --> 28:32.711
I won't.

28:32.754 --> 28:33.581
You will.

28:33.624 --> 28:34.408
No.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.802
We are born Van Helsing.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.673
This is what our mother did.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.545
Jacob told us that only
one of us is gonna survive,

28:41.589 --> 28:43.765
so either we are gonna be
the ones to walk the path

28:43.809 --> 28:49.249
and destroy them all with light
or we must be destroyed

28:49.292 --> 28:51.512
to make all that possible.

28:51.555 --> 28:52.861
No, no, no, both of
you just listen to me.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.298
Listen to me. 치*치치*치 listen to me!

28:55.342 --> 28:57.344
You don't have to do this.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.828
Don't do this.

29:02.871 --> 29:06.005
I wanna stay with you, Axel.

29:06.048 --> 29:06.701
Then stay.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.050
I can't.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.400
I was never gonna walk
out of here.

29:10.444 --> 29:11.445
What're you talking about?

29:11.488 --> 29:16.493
Either she goes dark
and kills us

29:16.537 --> 29:19.322
or I make the sacrifice
and give her the strength

29:19.366 --> 29:22.108
to do the right thing.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.152
Scarlett, listen to me...

29:23.196 --> 29:26.329
It's the only way.

29:26.373 --> 29:30.856
You have to let me go, Axel.

29:30.899 --> 29:31.770
I can't.

29:31.813 --> 29:35.034
You have to let me go.

29:35.077 --> 29:36.731
I'm sorry.

29:47.786 --> 29:48.787
I love you.

29:49.613 --> 29:50.658
I love you.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.229
There's gotta be another way.
Come on.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.275
No.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.587
Scarlett, don't.

30:06.630 --> 30:09.590
We have to do this.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.113
No Scarlett, not her.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.419
Don't do it.

30:12.462 --> 30:13.420
Look at me.

30:13.463 --> 30:15.248
Look at me!

30:15.291 --> 30:16.902
Kill me.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.425
Kill me!

30:18.468 --> 30:23.473
Not the light in her heart,
are you?

30:23.517 --> 30:26.346
But why you?

30:26.389 --> 30:28.957
Killing me will fuel the light
in her.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.873
And the light will win.

30:31.917 --> 30:38.227
You would do that for her?

30:38.271 --> 30:39.881
For everyone.

30:56.724 --> 30:59.770
Oh my god.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.122
So what're you saying?

31:03.165 --> 31:04.775
She can't be trusted.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.561
But she still has value
to the company.

31:07.604 --> 31:11.608
The work Caitlyn had her doing
was important.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.263
And what is that, exactly?

31:14.307 --> 31:17.658
Perfecting the repellant,
for one.

31:17.701 --> 31:21.227
Look, our work here is
too valuable to Black Tech

31:21.270 --> 31:24.404
to let her just walk away
from it no matter what she did.

31:24.447 --> 31:27.102
Walking away from a murder
is not something I can justify

31:27.146 --> 31:28.799
to the people in this city.

31:28.843 --> 31:31.280
That's why you're not gonna
tell them.

31:31.324 --> 31:33.804
That's not gonna wash.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.502
Caitlyn was one of mine.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.199
As far as anyone else
is concerned

31:37.243 --> 31:40.289
I shipped her out during
the chaos.

31:40.333 --> 31:46.426
And what if someone starts to
dig a little deeper into that?

31:46.469 --> 31:49.603
We still operate under the rule
of law, right?

31:49.646 --> 31:53.215
Denver is a free city
because Black Tech made it one.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.826
It's under your watch
that it's falling apart.

31:55.870 --> 31:58.568
Don't worry, the company still
has confidence

31:58.612 --> 32:02.137
in your ability
to set it all right.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.617
Don't make us question that.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.053
And what about her?

32:05.097 --> 32:06.446
The doctor?

32:06.489 --> 32:08.100
She knows the truth.

32:08.143 --> 32:11.277
Find her and bring her to me.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.410
Do you think you can
manage that?

32:17.196 --> 32:19.285
Yeah.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.909
You are our only hope.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.737
It has to be you.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.086
Scarlett, stop.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.261
I won't do it.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.393
Scarlett, don't do this.

32:40.436 --> 32:41.785
Don't do it.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.526
I didn't believe in you, ok?

32:43.570 --> 32:45.572
I thought you were a figment
of my imagination,

32:45.615 --> 32:47.574
just some false memory.

32:47.617 --> 32:50.751
But then we found each other.

32:50.794 --> 32:54.885
We figured out the truth
and we remembered who we are.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.757
Why we're here.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.368
It's for a reason.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.022
All of it.

33:02.763 --> 33:06.419
What're you doing, Scarlett?

33:06.462 --> 33:08.377
Don't do it.

33:08.421 --> 33:09.204
Scarlett.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.901
You.

33:10.945 --> 33:14.166
You will end the darkness.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.037
Please don't.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.038
Don't do it.

33:17.082 --> 33:20.128
You. You.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.261
Scarlett, no.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.393
Don't do it.

33:24.437 --> 33:25.829
Ahhhhhh!!!!!

33:25.873 --> 33:27.614
No!

33:28.267 --> 33:30.225
Scarlett, no!

33:36.405 --> 33:39.321
Noooo!!!!!!!!

33:44.239 --> 33:47.634
Noooooooo!!!!

33:52.595 --> 33:55.207
I gave you everything.

33:55.250 --> 33:58.862
I gave you everything I had
just to save you.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.734
Then you do this?

34:02.301 --> 34:04.694
You could have stopped her.

34:04.738 --> 34:08.568
You're the strong one!

34:08.611 --> 34:10.613
You can't fight the darkness.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.659
You are the darkness!

34:16.445 --> 34:19.013
Let me go you miserable
hag bitch!

34:30.111 --> 34:32.722
What have you done?

34:32.766 --> 34:34.768
You had to purge the light
in your heart,

34:34.811 --> 34:39.468
that is true, but that step
you took it already.

34:39.512 --> 34:43.777
The darkness already defeated
the light in your heart,

34:43.820 --> 34:45.561
you know.

34:45.605 --> 34:48.782
What're you talking about?

34:48.825 --> 34:51.132
Your little girl.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.655
Dylan.

34:54.657 --> 34:57.834
I- I tried to save her.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.923
But did you?

34:59.967 --> 35:02.709
You bit her.

35:02.752 --> 35:07.061
Turned her human again
and then she died.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.325
Because of you, she did.
You meant to...

35:10.369 --> 35:13.372
No, I did not sacrifice her.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.809
But you did!

35:15.852 --> 35:19.160
You could have stopped her
but you didn't.

35:19.204 --> 35:22.903
That's how deep
the darkness goes.

35:22.946 --> 35:29.214
The sister Scarlett,
she died for nothing.

35:29.257 --> 35:30.911
For nothing!

35:36.395 --> 35:38.832
If I ever see you again
I'll kill you.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.703
You hear me, Vanessa?

35:44.272 --> 35:46.144
I'll kill all of you.

35:52.193 --> 35:55.936
My sister's sacrifice won't be
for nothing.

35:55.979 --> 36:01.985
I will defeat the dark one
because I am the light.

36:04.162 --> 36:08.035
Such a gift you were offered.

36:08.078 --> 36:11.995
Such a disappointment
you have been.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.040
Pity.

37:15.233 --> 37:19.541
Elder now you have become.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.070
My destiny.

37:45.915 --> 37:46.742
Julius!

37:46.786 --> 37:48.396
Stay in formation!

37:56.839 --> 37:58.493
Whoever she is, you
can't help her now.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.713
But you can still help us.

38:00.756 --> 38:01.540
Over there.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.063
Survivors.

38:03.106 --> 38:05.370
We secure them,
escort them out.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.762
Let's move.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.547
Hold on. Wait a second.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.510
This doesn't look obvious
to you?

38:15.554 --> 38:17.164
What, that they're being
held hostage?

38:17.207 --> 38:18.339
That they're bait.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.689
We can't leave them.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.256
Listen to me.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.302
This is what we're gonna do.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.624
Scab!

38:42.668 --> 38:46.062
I know you're in here.

38:46.106 --> 38:49.196
It's me you want.

38:49.239 --> 38:52.460
What're you waiting for?

39:16.919 --> 39:19.400
Let 'em go.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.315
It's me you want.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.492
It's me you've always wanted.

39:24.536 --> 39:27.190
Why not both?

39:29.497 --> 39:33.545
I keep them, I kill you.

39:36.548 --> 39:37.679
Julius!

39:42.815 --> 39:44.207
Callie.

39:44.947 --> 39:46.384
Julius!

39:50.736 --> 39:54.348
Anointed by the dark one
so you are worthy.

39:54.392 --> 39:59.832
Destroy that which desires
to destroy us.

39:59.875 --> 40:00.702
Kill her!

40:04.358 --> 40:07.361
You are the light.

40:34.693 --> 40:38.392
There's one thing
in my heart now.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.307
Death.

41:04.418 --> 41:09.205
For me this is the beginning.

41:09.249 --> 41:16.343
But for you, and humankind,
you must accept this is the end.

41:16.386 --> 41:17.605
Never!

41:49.550 --> 41:50.290
Lily?

41:50.333 --> 41:51.770
Yes.

41:51.813 --> 41:53.467
How do you know me?

41:55.513 --> 41:57.602
And what is that hellish beast?

41:57.645 --> 41:59.212
The nightmare I have to kill.

41:59.255 --> 42:02.215
You can't.
Not alone.

42:02.258 --> 42:03.695
I have to.

42:03.738 --> 42:05.566
Or die trying.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.046
There's another way.

42:07.089 --> 42:08.264
Trust me.

42:08.308 --> 42:10.832
There is no other way.

42:10.876 --> 42:16.055
The Van Helsings end now.

42:17.447 --> 42:18.927
What other way?

42:18.971 --> 42:20.668
Together.
