39:15.776 --> 39:19.803
Whywas I burned?
Who did this to me? Come on,Jan.

39:19.880 --> 39:24.214
I need to know whatyou know.
Now would be the time to tell me.

39:25.486 --> 39:27.886
A lot of people...
wantyou dead.

39:27.955 --> 39:29.889
From old days.

39:29.957 --> 39:32.619
Nowyou're out.

39:32.693 --> 39:35.059
No one to protect--

39:35.129 --> 39:37.063
That's all.

39:37.131 --> 39:38.598
Whywas I burned?

39:38.665 --> 39:42.101
- I swear.
- Who did this to me? Jan.

39:42.169 --> 39:43.761

39:57.851 --> 40:00.615
[ Phone Beeps ]

40:00.687 --> 40:04.145
Sam. You know Toni's All American
Hot Dog down by the boardwalk?

40:04.224 --> 40:08.160
Of courseyou do. Getyour F.B.I. guys
over there right awaywith an ambulance.

40:08.228 --> 40:12.358
Ifthis doesn't get them offyour ass,
I don't know what will.

40:18.605 --> 40:20.539
[Banging]

40:55.108 --> 40:58.134
Sam, did the F..B.I. pick
Jan up last night?

40:58.212 --> 41:00.510
Yeah, I don't think these guys
get a lot of action.

41:00.581 --> 41:04.449
Theywere very excited to finally get their hands
on a former Soviet Bloc wet work guy.

41:04.518 --> 41:07.351
- Theywere like kids on Christmas.
- What did they get out ofhim?

41:07.421 --> 41:10.413
He tried to kill me.
I assume he's gonna try and finish the job.

41:10.491 --> 41:12.482
Yeah, about that.

41:12.559 --> 41:15.357
- I guess they never got a chance to talk to him.
- Why is that?

41:15.429 --> 41:19.422
I don't know the details. Some guys came by
in the middle ofthe night and took him away.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.491
- What guys?
- Nobody knows.

41:21.568 --> 41:23.536
Theywalked in with some
heavy-duty clearances...

41:23.604 --> 41:26.266
tookJan offthe F.B.I.'s
hands and, poof, theywere gone.

41:26.340 --> 41:29.798
Word is they found Jan
hanging from his shoelaces.

41:29.877 --> 41:33.040
I mean, who leaves a guy in a holding cell
with shoelaces, right?

41:33.113 --> 41:37.106
Anyway, they're calling it a suicide.

41:37.184 --> 41:39.118
Yeah.

41:39.186 --> 41:41.177
Doyou knowwhat's goin' on?

41:42.523 --> 41:45.651
Looks like whoever burned me
has something planned.

41:45.726 --> 41:50.288
They don't want me leaving Miami,
but they don'twant me dead either.

41:50.364 --> 41:53.527
- Doyou know why?
- Notyet.
