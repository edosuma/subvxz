WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.180
- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

00:06.223 --> 00:07.485
- I have Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.444
I'm gonna move back in
with my parents.

00:09.487 --> 00:10.445
In Idaho.

00:10.488 --> 00:13.187
- Maybe you can
move in with me.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.451
- What do you think
would happen

00:16.494 --> 00:17.713
if you stopped helping people?

00:17.756 --> 00:19.019
What would they see?

00:19.062 --> 00:22.022
- They would see
what a complete loser I am--

00:22.065 --> 00:25.112
corny, nerdy, fat.

00:25.155 --> 00:29.290
- San Francisco's sounding
really good right about now.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.769
Let's get out of here.

00:30.813 --> 00:33.816
- The pattern of your behavior
can actually be indicative

00:33.859 --> 00:36.558
of a more substantive
diagnosis per the DSM-5.

00:36.601 --> 00:37.602
- Such as?

00:37.646 --> 00:39.604
- Narcissistic Personality
Disorder?

00:39.648 --> 00:41.824
- Effective immediately,
you are stripped of your title

00:41.867 --> 00:43.347
as cochair of oncology,

00:43.391 --> 00:46.176
as well as your duties
as deputy medical director.

00:58.275 --> 01:02.149
- ♪ Computer, what's the point
in this? ♪

01:02.192 --> 01:04.281
♪ You do all the thinking

01:04.325 --> 01:05.848
♪ Where are we?

01:08.807 --> 01:11.462
♪ Just building shelters
in the snow ♪

01:11.506 --> 01:13.116
- At the center,
where they belong,

01:13.160 --> 01:14.204
so I am introducing

01:14.248 --> 01:16.119
a new initiative
to change that,

01:16.163 --> 01:18.382
one that reconnects
all of our doctors to our...

01:18.426 --> 01:20.515
- ♪ I know it's fallen down

01:23.387 --> 01:25.389
♪ Got my headphones on

01:25.433 --> 01:27.739
♪ And I won't hear a sound

01:35.791 --> 01:37.140
- Ligon did what?

01:37.184 --> 01:38.576
- I know.

01:38.620 --> 01:41.144
Who could've guessed
that having sex with my doctor

01:41.188 --> 01:43.886
and fellow drug addict
would turn out poorly?

01:43.929 --> 01:45.844
- Are you okay?

01:45.888 --> 01:47.411
- No, not really.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.587
But is it crazy to think
that this all happened

01:49.631 --> 01:52.373
at exactly the same time
I get a large chunk of money

01:52.416 --> 01:53.852
from my family's trust?

01:53.896 --> 01:56.290
- What, you think
the money's cursed?

01:56.333 --> 01:57.769
- I think bad things happen

01:57.813 --> 01:59.467
anytime my family does
anything,

01:59.510 --> 02:02.296
but especially
when there's money involved.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.862
- How much are we talking?

02:03.906 --> 02:05.386
- Whatever amount
is in your head,

02:05.429 --> 02:06.735
times it by ten,

02:06.778 --> 02:10.173
and then taint it with
toxic family relationships.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.393
- Well, just buy a house
in the Hamptons

02:12.436 --> 02:14.830
so we can grow old
and "Grey Gardens" together.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.398
- How are you holding up?

02:17.441 --> 02:19.313
- Great.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.446
It's good.
I've got so much time freed up.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.231
- Helen.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.623
- It's horrible.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.625
Honestly, I thought
that it would be easier,

02:27.669 --> 02:31.586
but I feel like I'm trespassing
in my own hospital.

02:31.629 --> 02:32.891
But I'm not gonna dwell on it.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.241
I'm just gonna keep
my head down

02:34.284 --> 02:36.678
and just focus on my patients.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.071
- Well, look,

02:39.115 --> 02:41.683
at least they still let you
monitor my drug tests.

02:41.726 --> 02:42.814
- Yes.

02:42.858 --> 02:45.208
Still allowed
to watch you pee.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.606
- Hey, missed you
at the department head meeting

02:51.649 --> 02:52.694
this morning.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.565
- Oh, I'm sure
it went swimmingly.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.219
How's my little munchkin
doing today?

02:56.263 --> 02:57.307
- I don't like you being
out of the loop.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.569
I didn't get to tell you
my big idea.

02:58.613 --> 02:59.614
- Is Luna going on rounds?

02:59.657 --> 03:00.963
Everyone loves seeing
baby boss.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.965
- Actually, it's time
for our six-month checkup,

03:03.008 --> 03:04.445
so we're headed
to the Ped's wing

03:04.488 --> 03:05.794
for some important vaccines.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.274
- Gosh.
Have fun.

03:07.317 --> 03:08.884
- Wait, I didn't get to
tell you my big idea.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.538
- No need.
- But I want to tell you.

03:10.581 --> 03:11.669
- I have patients.

03:11.713 --> 03:12.975
- Sounds like you have
zero patience,

03:13.018 --> 03:14.324
with a C.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.673
See what I did there?
It's a pun.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.198
- It's hilarious.
Gotta go, bye.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.895
Terrible.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.899
- Hi.
- Just one sec.

03:29.426 --> 03:31.341
I can take that.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.996
Welcome home.
- Thank you.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.650
That was beautiful.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.129
- Hot chai is ready.

03:37.173 --> 03:40.002
- Oh, thank you, I just--
I have to rush off to work.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.873
- Okay, then I'll quickly
show you my home.

03:41.917 --> 03:42.874
- Okay.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.746
- This is the kitchen.
- Yeah.

03:44.789 --> 03:48.271
- And this is the living room.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.403
- Kay.

03:49.446 --> 03:50.882
- That's my mandir.
- Mm-hmm.

03:52.362 --> 03:55.017
And this will be your room.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.803
- I-It--it appears
occupied.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.979
- Yes, this was Rohan's room.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.242
- You don't say.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.721
- When he first left home,

04:03.765 --> 04:06.463
his mother insisted that
we leave the room as it is,

04:06.507 --> 04:08.552
in case he needed to come back.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.294
We will squeeze you in.

04:11.338 --> 04:14.558
And this is his famous
posters wall.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.647
- Right.
- You cannot touch these.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.475
Come with me.
- Kay.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.738
- I have to show you something.

04:28.964 --> 04:32.620
And my wife's sewing room
is perfect for the baby.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.363
- Where will the crib go?
- Oh...

04:36.406 --> 04:38.800
No need to change much.

04:38.843 --> 04:39.975
Oh.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.546
What about here?

04:45.589 --> 04:47.809
- Uh, great.
- I'll show you

04:47.852 --> 04:49.680
the bathroom now.
- Kay.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.315
- Elandra Siefert,
33-year-old woman.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.360
Restrained driver in a MVA.
Multiple crush injuries.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.666
- What do you got?
- Hemothorax.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.711
I suspect a lacerated
pulmonary artery.

05:20.755 --> 05:22.104
She's losing blood by the pint.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.627
- When can we get her
to the OR?

05:23.671 --> 05:25.803
- Tying off an arterial pumper
now, then she's all yours.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.718
- Ma'am why don't you come with
me so the doctors can work?

05:27.762 --> 05:28.980
- No, she's my sister.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.591
- Floyd, this is gonna be
a long surgery.

05:30.634 --> 05:31.983
You sure you're up for it?

05:32.027 --> 05:33.811
- Wound's healed, I'll be fine.
What about you?

05:33.855 --> 05:35.335
- Wound's healed.
I'll be fine.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.120
- B/P 80/40 and dropping.
Tachy at 130 and rising.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.383
- Yo, we gotta go.
- Okay, I'm almost there.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.776
- Breathing pattern
ineffective.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.517
- Okay, she's all yours.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.345
- Is Elandra on
any medications,

05:45.388 --> 05:46.476
or has she had
any health scares?

05:46.520 --> 05:47.825
- No meds.
She was a Marine.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.958
She's crazy healthy.
Please help her!

05:50.001 --> 05:51.481
- Okay, all right, we're gonna
do everything we can.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.656
Let's go!
- Incoming!

05:52.700 --> 05:53.918
- Out of the way.
- Trey Masterson.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.833
18, with an anaphylactic
reaction.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.705
Epi Auto Injector times two
with no response.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.402
- High-dose Epi.

05:59.446 --> 06:02.753
- Original B/P 130 over 70,
down to 110 over 50.

06:02.797 --> 06:05.495
- Heart rate 148.
O2 sats 84 and dropping.

06:05.539 --> 06:06.888
- Okay, doubling dose.

06:06.931 --> 06:10.021
- Heart rate at 160.
- Okay, but O2's up to 90.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.546
- We got him.
- Trey?

06:12.589 --> 06:14.852
Trey, has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.027
- No.
- Okay.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.551
Any medical history
we should know about?

06:17.594 --> 06:20.510
- I had lymphoma.

06:20.554 --> 06:21.729
Four years ago.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.774
- Okay.
- Dr. Sharpe treated me.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.385
- Okay, okay,
we're gonna run some tests

06:25.428 --> 06:27.125
to figure out what caused
this allergic reaction,

06:27.169 --> 06:28.866
and let's page Sharpe.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.959
- Hey.
- Hi, Dr. Goodwin.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.571
I'll let Dr. Elder know
you're here.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.748
- Thanks.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.706
- Oh.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.456
- Is anyone--

06:53.500 --> 06:54.675
- Oh, sorry.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.112
- Thanks.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.809
- Are you gonna walk for me?

06:58.853 --> 07:00.942
Are we walking today?

07:02.944 --> 07:04.119
- How old is yours?

07:04.162 --> 07:05.642
- Six months.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.514
- Walking's right around
the corner.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.993
- Yeah, so I've heard.

07:09.037 --> 07:12.214
I keep putting her
on the treadmill, but no luck.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.825
- Well, this wobbly girl
is Bobbi.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.915
- Oh.
Hey there.

07:17.959 --> 07:21.179
This sweet girl is Luna.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.967
- You know, it's nice
that the adults

07:26.010 --> 07:27.142
don't have to put
the qualifiers

07:27.185 --> 07:28.752
before our names too.

07:28.796 --> 07:31.102
- Actually, I think we'd treat
each other better if we did.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.891
Hi, I'm "anxious in hospitals"
Alice.

07:37.979 --> 07:41.156
- I'm "hiding behind my smile"
Max.

07:46.248 --> 07:49.469
- Hey.
Have you heard Max's big idea?

07:49.512 --> 07:51.079
No screens?

07:51.122 --> 07:52.602
- That is a big idea.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.169
- No screens in patient rooms,

07:54.212 --> 07:56.127
no tablets, no computers.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.955
He's not serious, is he?

07:57.999 --> 07:59.914
- He's definitely serious.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.785
- But we don't actually
have to do it, do we?

08:01.829 --> 08:03.613
- You most certainly do,
and not only that,

08:03.657 --> 08:05.876
but as chair, it's your job
to share this new rule

08:05.920 --> 08:07.225
with your entire department.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.184
One down.
Good luck with the rest.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.883
- Dr. Sharpe.
- Dr. Baker.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.712
- Don't say my name nicely when
it's clear how furious I am.

08:15.756 --> 08:16.844
This is unacceptable.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.106
- I'm not sure
what you're referring to.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.107
- No screens?

08:19.150 --> 08:20.195
- I had nothing to do
with that.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.023
- Then veto it!
We need screens.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.503
This isn't the Stone Age.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.287
- As I'm certain you've heard,
I'm no longer management.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.984
I am just a doctor
like yourself,

08:27.028 --> 08:29.987
keeping my head down
and focusing on my patients.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.600
- Dr. Sharpe.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.776
No screens during any
patient encounters

08:35.819 --> 08:37.212
is, frankly, outlandish.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.300
- Dr. Eliraz, long time.

08:38.343 --> 08:39.823
I'm doing well.
Thank you for asking.

08:39.867 --> 08:40.955
- Dr. Sharpe.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.217
- Without looking
at a computer screen,

08:42.260 --> 08:44.001
I can't keep my patients' names
straight.

08:44.045 --> 08:45.002
- I suspect that's why

08:45.046 --> 08:46.569
Dr. Goodwin instated
the policy.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.528
More face-to-face
emotional engagement.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.573
- Since I was an intern,
I've always had a screen

08:50.617 --> 08:51.792
in my exam room.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.010
- We can't do our jobs
without our screens.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.185
- You have to make this
go away.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.622
- Enough!

08:55.665 --> 08:56.971
I am not the deputy
medical director,

08:57.014 --> 08:58.276
I am not a department chair,

08:58.320 --> 08:59.669
I am not anyone who is
in charge of anything,

08:59.713 --> 09:01.149
so my advice to all of you
is to suck it up,

09:01.192 --> 09:02.759
swallow your pride,
keep your head down,

09:02.803 --> 09:04.979
and do the one damn thing
that Max has asked of you,

09:05.022 --> 09:07.677
which is what I am
trying to do!

09:07.721 --> 09:09.113
And just for the record,

09:09.157 --> 09:11.333
you should bloody well know
your patients' names.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.033
- Hi, Luna.
Can you say hi?

09:16.077 --> 09:18.645
Say hola.
Shalom?

09:18.688 --> 09:21.082
- Bobbi, you wanna say hi
to Luna?

09:22.518 --> 09:23.650
She's totally thinking "hello."

09:23.693 --> 09:26.217
- Yeah, totally got that.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.523
What are you in for?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.351
- Bobbi keeps getting
these ear infections.

09:29.394 --> 09:30.657
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.049
They're scared they could
delay her speech,

09:32.093 --> 09:34.356
so an ENT's putting these tubes
in her ears.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.749
- Tympanostomy.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.012
- That's the word
I keep meaning to write down.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.579
Maybe you could toss them
on in,

09:39.622 --> 09:41.581
seeing as you're already
in scrubs.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.321
- Yeah, I'm not really
an ear guy,

09:43.365 --> 09:44.801
but if she had Ebola--

09:44.845 --> 09:46.716
- In that case, we'll stick
with the ear infections.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.588
- That's fair.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.198
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yep.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.330
- You can come on back now.
- Oh, great.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.202
Hope the doctor
gets to you soon.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.552
- Thanks.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.206
Nice to meet you.
- You too.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.294
- And Luna.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.209
- Yeah, she's totally
thinking "bye!"

10:01.252 --> 10:02.297
- Say "bye!"
- Bye!

10:02.340 --> 10:03.646
- Bye, Bobbi.
- Bye, Luna.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.563
- And on a scale of one to ten,
how bad is the pain?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.217
- Maybe a four,

10:09.260 --> 10:10.697
but it's nothing
compared to my knee.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.133
- So it's your knee as well.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.613
And what number would you give
your knee?

10:13.656 --> 10:15.527
- Well, if my foot is a nine,

10:15.571 --> 10:16.833
then I'd say my knee
is an eight.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.227
Shouldn't you be typing this
into a computer?

10:19.270 --> 10:20.707
- I've got it all right here,
okay?

10:20.750 --> 10:24.754
So, it is your shoulder,

10:24.798 --> 10:26.626
your knee, and your foot.

10:26.669 --> 10:27.627
And that is everything.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.672
- And my skin is very dry.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.282
- Huh, so that's not
everything.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.676
- I wasn't sure if you did
skin stuff.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.982
- Okay, Mr. Pembroke,

10:35.025 --> 10:36.853
why don't you just tell me
all of your concerns?

10:36.897 --> 10:39.073
- Well, the only other thing
I can think of

10:39.116 --> 10:40.814
is muscle aches...

10:40.857 --> 10:42.293
- Mm-hmm.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.600
- Blurred vision, exhaustion,

10:44.644 --> 10:47.081
headaches, constipation,

10:47.124 --> 10:48.778
oh, and I'm always freezing.

10:48.822 --> 10:49.823
- Okay, I'm gonna go

10:49.866 --> 10:51.302
and get this logged
into your chart

10:51.346 --> 10:53.435
before I forget, and then
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

10:53.478 --> 10:56.090
Okay, so you've got
shoulder pain,

10:56.133 --> 10:58.309
connected to the knee pain,
connected to the foot pain,

10:58.353 --> 11:01.835
dry skin, blurry vision,
muscle aches, exhaustion,

11:01.878 --> 11:04.751
constipation, and...

11:07.579 --> 11:09.146
Oh, no.

11:09.190 --> 11:12.584
- Making the incision between
the sixth and seventh rib.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.891
- Get me a pair of

11:14.935 --> 11:16.893
- Gonna need a saline flush.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.156
- Isolating pulmonary artery.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.506
- Polypropalyne sutures.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.770
Need a new carton
of lap pads.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.467
- Suture.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.556
- 500 milliliters .

11:27.599 --> 11:29.297
- That should do it.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.474
- Her heart rate's
still rising.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.867
- Should be slowing down.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.347
- And her blood pressure's
dropping.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.698
- I got all the bleeders.
- There must be something else.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.438
- Hypotensive, tachycardic--

11:41.526 --> 11:42.876
- And a lacy red rash.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.660
- That's a transfusion
reaction.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.880
Her body's rejecting the blood.
Disconnect it!

11:47.837 --> 11:50.405
And call hematology!
- Assess for DIC.

11:50.448 --> 11:51.928
- She's oozing blood
everywhere.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.583
- BP is still dropping.

11:54.626 --> 11:55.932
- Gauze.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.371
Come on, come on.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.766
-  Dr. Reynolds,
tell me what's happening.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.202
- Where's Sharpe?

12:05.246 --> 12:06.464
- If there's an issue
with the blood product,

12:06.508 --> 12:07.683
the chair of hematology
gets paged,

12:07.727 --> 12:08.945
and right now, that's me.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.338
- Sorry, just habit.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.774
- You suspect a transfusion
reaction?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.950
- Yeah, a big one.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.778
- Okay, I'm on it.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.608
-  down.
Get a new one.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.349
- Dr. Sharpe.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.437
Long time no see.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.439
- Hello, Trey.

12:24.482 --> 12:25.962
How are you feeling?

12:26.006 --> 12:27.747
- Like someone who was almost
murdered by crab cakes.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.400
They figure out
why it happened?

12:31.838 --> 12:34.536
What is it?

12:41.586 --> 12:43.632
- Trey, I have some bad news.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.725
The newfound allergies
that you have

12:49.769 --> 12:51.814
are from your lymphoma,

12:51.858 --> 12:53.903
which means that it's returned.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.344
- So, it's back to chemo?

13:00.388 --> 13:01.693
- The cancer has spread

13:01.737 --> 13:03.391
too aggressively
for chemotherapy.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.872
It's beyond anything
that we can treat.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.354
- But we beat it.

13:10.398 --> 13:11.616
You and me.
You said we beat it.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.532
- It's not fair,
and it doesn't make any sense,

13:14.576 --> 13:16.317
and I am so sorry.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.366
- How long?

13:22.410 --> 13:23.846
- Four months.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.935
Maybe six.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.244
Are your parents here?

13:30.287 --> 13:31.332
I'm gonna call them.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.855
- No, don't.
- Trey--

13:32.899 --> 13:34.596
- I don't want them to know.

14:05.670 --> 14:06.628
- Have you got a minute?

14:06.671 --> 14:07.716
- Oh, hi.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.849
Yeah, actually,
I'm glad you're here.

14:09.892 --> 14:10.850
Would you say that I have

14:10.893 --> 14:13.591
Narcissistic Personality
Disorder?

14:13.635 --> 14:16.420
Because the DSM says that
people who are narcissistic

14:16.464 --> 14:18.466
are typically quite haughty.

14:18.509 --> 14:19.989
Is that how you would
characterize me?

14:20.033 --> 14:21.948
Haughty?
Just give it to me straight.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.514
Am I haughty?

14:23.558 --> 14:25.516
- You know, I heard
a really good hypothetical

14:25.560 --> 14:26.735
to tell if you're a narcissist.

14:26.778 --> 14:27.954
- Good, what is it?

14:27.997 --> 14:29.085
- If a colleague shows up
at your office

14:29.129 --> 14:30.347
during the work day,

14:30.391 --> 14:31.740
do you assume they're there
for a reason,

14:31.783 --> 14:33.350
or just to hear you talk
nonsense?

14:37.572 --> 14:38.529
- Lay it on me.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.662
- His name's Trey.

14:40.705 --> 14:43.578
He's 18, and he wants
to die alone.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.625
- The mutiny is upon us.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.627
- Why does no one ever stop me
with good news?

14:49.671 --> 14:51.673
Honestly, I'm gonna start using
the air ducts.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.588
- The neurology
and neurosurgery departments

14:53.631 --> 14:54.806
are in open revolt.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.591
- So naturally, you come
to an oncologist.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.028
- Max's ban on screens
is completely impractical.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.595
Screens are vital

15:00.638 --> 15:03.511
even for the most basic
neurological patient encounter.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.556
- Do you know what's most
interesting about neurology?

15:05.600 --> 15:06.644
- What?
- I couldn't tell you.

15:06.688 --> 15:07.689
It's not my department.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.909
- My clinic is in chaos.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.345
You must help.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.694
- I can't.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.783
I don't have a position
of authority, Vijay.

15:14.826 --> 15:17.829
There's no reason for roving
gangs of rebel neurologists

15:17.873 --> 15:20.354
to listen to me.
- Max listens to you.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.704
It's not about your title.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.924
You have Max's ear.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.838
Please.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.579
For the patients.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.198
- Yeah.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.026
- Just so you know,
your big idea

15:40.069 --> 15:41.984
is going down
like a lead balloon.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.551
- Look there's something--

15:43.594 --> 15:45.727
there's something wrong
with Luna.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.772
- Max, what--do they know
what it is, or--

15:47.816 --> 15:50.514
- Not yet.
What do you need?

15:50.558 --> 15:52.081
- Nothing.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.865
I'll handle it.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.052
- A small bump, Dr. Goodwin.
Likely a lipoma.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.314
- Do you wanna biopsy it?

16:07.357 --> 16:08.663
- I don't want you to panic.

16:08.706 --> 16:11.100
- Well, I have--
had cancer.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.406
- Cancer is so unlikely.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.582
- Yeah, I know, I know,
but it could be,

16:14.625 --> 16:17.498
or it could be a hemangioma
or a Budd-Chiari malformation--

16:17.541 --> 16:18.847
- I highly doubt that.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.544
- I don't want to doubt, kay?
I'd like to know.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.633
I need to know.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.374
- I could biopsy it, but--
- Okay.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.507
- We could be opening up
ourselves to a false positive--

16:26.550 --> 16:29.379
- Do it.
Kay?

16:32.600 --> 16:33.905
Hey.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.516
- It has come to my attention

16:35.559 --> 16:38.736
that you have been brazenly
disregarding Max's directive.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.173
- Because it's crazy.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.696
- And yet, I'm fairly certain
it wasn't optional.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.741
- We need our screens
for consults.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.916
- And Max believes

16:44.960 --> 16:46.701
having your faces buried
in your tablet

16:46.744 --> 16:48.833
only alienates you
from your patients.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.531
Now, I've spoken with Max
directly

16:50.574 --> 16:51.880
and he would like you
to get this done,

16:51.923 --> 16:53.882
so tell me, how can I help?

16:53.925 --> 16:55.057
- Do you know
how much information

16:55.101 --> 16:56.754
we're expected to enter
for each patient?

16:56.798 --> 16:58.408
- 36 pages.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.367
- 2/3rds of which is insurance
coding and billing questions.

17:00.410 --> 17:01.542
- And we have no choice
but to do it

17:01.585 --> 17:02.891
during the consults.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.066
- Since it takes
about 15 minutes of scrolling

17:04.110 --> 17:05.285
to fill it all out.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.634
If we can't do it
during the patient visit,

17:06.677 --> 17:08.027
we'll have to do it after.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.550
- Which means each patient
will take twice as long,

17:09.593 --> 17:11.117
and we'll end up seeing
half as many patients.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.816
- And some of us
are not the fastest typists.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.209
- Okay.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.821
So, what if we were to hire,
say, medical scribes

17:19.864 --> 17:21.953
who could input the data
while you were consulting.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.694
Would that help?
- That would be incredible.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.000
- You can do that?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.654
- No, but Max can,
and if Max wants this done,

17:26.697 --> 17:27.872
then consider it done.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.439
Six new medical scribes
coming your way.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.746
- That's--thank you.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.488
Thank you!

17:34.531 --> 17:36.925
- See, I knew Max
would listen to you.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.538
- How about an indoor
rock climbing wall?

17:41.582 --> 17:43.975
- Okay, what part of
"this money is cursed"

17:44.019 --> 17:44.976
didn't you understand?

17:45.020 --> 17:46.500
- Sauna and hot tub?
- No.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.762
- Jet skis.
- Sure.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.590
- Really?
- No.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.809
Eli, Eli, Eli.
Okay.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.203
Now you, you nearly had me
stumped,

17:54.247 --> 17:55.683
what with your litany
of issues.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.511
I mean, the headaches,
the knee,

17:57.554 --> 18:00.079
the inability to regulate
your body temperature.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.081
I mean, I really had
to dig deep,

18:02.124 --> 18:05.084
and I searched far and wide.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.782
I mean, I even consulted
a dusty old medical text.

18:07.825 --> 18:10.741
But I have figured it out.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.134
I know what you have.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.093
It is called a low thyroid,

18:14.136 --> 18:18.053
and it explains
all of your symptoms.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.012
- Even the cut on my leg
that won't heal?

18:21.056 --> 18:22.797
- What cut on your leg
that won't heal?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.929
- Did I forget to mention
that one?

18:24.973 --> 18:28.107
- Yeah, must've slipped
your mind.

18:28.150 --> 18:31.545
- So, do I still have
a low thyroid, Dr. Bloom?

18:32.937 --> 18:35.766
- No.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.813
Okay, so,

18:38.856 --> 18:40.815
cut on your leg

18:40.858 --> 18:43.078
that won't heal...

18:45.820 --> 18:49.128
Constipation...

18:49.171 --> 18:51.173
headaches...

18:54.045 --> 18:55.221
- Dr. Sharpe.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.700
- Sandra Fall from billing.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.659
- Why did you requisition
six medical scribes?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.574
- I didn't.
That was Max.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.880
- Except the entire neurology
department said it was you.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.839
- Doesn't that sound
like something Max would do?

19:04.882 --> 19:05.883
- Unfortunately, yes.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.146
So, why didn't he sign
the paperwork?

19:07.189 --> 19:08.799
- You know, that also
sounds like something

19:08.843 --> 19:10.105
Max would forget to do.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.802
- I can't approve
the requisition of new staff

19:11.846 --> 19:13.630
without the medical director's
signature.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.676
- Okay, wait.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.068
Turn around.
- Why?

19:17.112 --> 19:19.201
- Plausible deniability.

19:22.248 --> 19:25.076
Okay, you can turn around now.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.862
That looks like Max signed it
to me.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.038
- That does seem like something
Max would do.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.697
- Have you ever heard
of magical thinking?

19:36.740 --> 19:37.698
No?

19:37.741 --> 19:40.570
It's the belief that

19:40.614 --> 19:43.138
our thoughts
can shape reality.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.922
The idea that
our deepest wishes

19:44.966 --> 19:48.143
can somehow shape
the physical world.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.884
Or sometimes, we hope

19:49.927 --> 19:52.060
that if we don't talk
about something,

19:52.103 --> 19:55.629
it won't happen.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.065
- You think I'm in
some weirdo headspace

19:57.108 --> 19:58.240
where if I don't tell
my parents,

19:58.284 --> 19:59.807
I think I won't die?

19:59.850 --> 20:02.026
- I think it's possible.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.115
- Okay, no.
That's not me at all.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.856
I'm fully clear
on my situation.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.556
- Okay.
- In six months, I'm toast.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.122
- Yeah.

20:13.690 --> 20:16.215
So, why not tell your parents?

20:16.258 --> 20:17.868
- Look, I'm 18,

20:17.912 --> 20:20.131
and three years of that was
spent sidelined with cancer,

20:20.175 --> 20:22.612
so experience-wise,
it's like I'm 15.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.919
I've got less than a year left,
and I want to go live.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.051
- That's great.
Why don't you tell them that?

20:27.095 --> 20:29.010
- If I did,
every time I leave the house,

20:29.053 --> 20:31.273
I'll have to deal
with their sad faces.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.883
That I'm choosing
to spend my last days

20:32.927 --> 20:34.581
with people that aren't them.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.147
- Okay, I get that, Trey,

20:36.191 --> 20:39.629
but you know there are physical
signs of cancer, right?

20:40.935 --> 20:43.764
Bottles of painkillers,
your body will be in decline.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.069
- So?

20:45.113 --> 20:46.767
- So your parents are bound
to notice that,

20:46.810 --> 20:48.943
don't you think?

20:48.986 --> 20:51.337
Terminal cancer's not really
something you can hide.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.341
- That's why I'm leaving.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.690
- Leaving?

20:56.733 --> 20:58.257
- I've been thinking about it
all morning.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.259
My buddy Jem is doing
a semester in Barcelona.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.261
I'm gonna take the semester off
and go crash with him,

21:02.304 --> 21:03.958
then after that,
I'll go wherever.

21:04.001 --> 21:08.223
Peru, climb the Andes,
hopefully lose my virginity.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.008
It's okay to laugh.
- I'm not laughing.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.143
- There's just so much
I haven't done.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.798
- So, your parents
are gonna hear about you dying

21:17.841 --> 21:19.887
on a mountain
thousands of miles away,

21:19.930 --> 21:21.280
all alone?

21:21.323 --> 21:22.890
- And it'll be awful for them.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.239
- Yeah.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.373
- But it's gonna be awful
for them no matter what.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.679
At least this way,
it won't be awful for me.

21:33.683 --> 21:34.815
- Yeah.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.864
Okay.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.084
I'm gonna go get
your discharge paperwork.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.833
- I know.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.835
I know, I know, I know.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.358
I know, I know, I know.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.360
I know.
- Everything okay?

21:58.404 --> 22:00.928
- They need to run some tests,
but--

22:00.971 --> 22:02.669
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.758
Sorry.
Can't seem to--

22:04.801 --> 22:06.673
- Don't worry about it.

22:06.716 --> 22:10.894
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:14.158 --> 22:17.858
My wife would have been
better at this.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.381
- Have you tried the Ss?

22:22.210 --> 22:24.212
Give it a try?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

22:24.255 --> 22:25.953
Hey, hey.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.869
Oh, hi.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.396
Hi.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.882
Raising a child by yourself
is hard.

22:41.925 --> 22:45.451
- Yeah.
Hoping it gets easier.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.409
- It won't.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.064
But you get better
at getting through it.

22:50.107 --> 22:51.892
Yeah.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.286
- Ms. Healy?

22:55.330 --> 22:57.724
The doctor will see you now.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.856
- There we go.
- Thanks.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.206
Hi.
Hi!

23:02.250 --> 23:03.904
Yeah, was that better?

23:08.038 --> 23:08.996
Good luck.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.780
- Thanks.
You too.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.438
- Hang another liter
of normal saline.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.570
- She has a positive ANA

23:17.613 --> 23:19.006
and double-stranded
DNA antibodies.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.007
- She has Lupus?

23:20.050 --> 23:21.443
- And it's making antibodies

23:21.487 --> 23:23.010
that are reacting to the
transfused red blood cells.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.533
- That's why she rejected it.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.274
- Any blood we give her needs
to be meticulously matched

23:26.317 --> 23:28.450
to dozens of proteins on the
surface of her red blood cells,

23:28.494 --> 23:29.756
or she'll react again.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.453
- Okay, so get it up here.
- We don't have any.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.281
But I'm gonna search
every hospital and blood bank

23:33.324 --> 23:34.848
until we find it.
- Well, you better hurry,

23:34.891 --> 23:37.285
or she's gonna bleed out
on the table.

23:47.121 --> 23:48.949
- Where's Bobbi?
- Still back there.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.341
- Oh.
- They let me watch

23:50.385 --> 23:52.822
as she went under, but then
said I had to wait here

23:52.866 --> 23:54.258
till after the procedure.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.825
- Yeah, that's typical.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.829
- Since my husband passed, I...

24:01.222 --> 24:03.354
I hate having her
out of my sight.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.444
I know she's okay, but--

24:05.487 --> 24:07.228
- I know, um...

24:09.056 --> 24:10.710
Come with me.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.417
- Are you sure we can be
back here?

24:22.461 --> 24:23.897
- I know a few people.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.986
You can leave that there
if you want.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.432
Chuck Turnbill's one of
the best ENTs in Manhattan.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.480
Now you get to see why.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.792
- Thank you.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.141
- Sure.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.842
- Dr. Goodwin,
we have Luna's results.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.887
- Excuse me.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.245
- We want medical
scribes too.

25:08.289 --> 25:09.508
- Oh, do you now?

25:09.551 --> 25:10.900
- We heard what you got
the neurosurgeons,

25:10.944 --> 25:12.293
and we want
the exact same thing.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.164
- Mm, but I distinctly recall
you telling me

25:14.208 --> 25:15.688
how much you love your screens,

25:15.731 --> 25:18.168
so hiring medical scribes
isn't gonna solve your problem.

25:18.212 --> 25:19.779
- So what are you gonna
give us?

25:19.822 --> 25:20.997
- Home visits.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.956
- Home visits?

25:22.999 --> 25:24.523
- To forge authentic
connections

25:24.566 --> 25:26.002
with the people that you treat,

25:26.046 --> 25:28.483
you need to do far more than
just set your screens aside.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.530
You need total immersion
in the lives of your patients.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.271
- Even if we wanted to do that,
which we don't,

25:34.315 --> 25:35.925
our schedules would never allow
for that.

25:35.969 --> 25:38.014
- I'm cancelling all
pulmonology clinic appointments

25:38.058 --> 25:39.538
for the next month.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.278
That should free up some time.
- Wait, you can't do that.

25:41.322 --> 25:42.845
- I'm not doing it, Max is.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.194
- You talked to him about us?

25:44.238 --> 25:46.022
- Yes, and he agreed
this is exactly what you need.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.458
You and your colleagues
are gonna start

25:47.502 --> 25:49.112
visiting your patients
in their home,

25:49.156 --> 25:51.071
and you are really gonna
get to know them.

25:51.114 --> 25:52.899
Max suggested
that you could start

25:52.942 --> 25:54.335
by learning their first names.

25:59.993 --> 26:00.994
- Eli.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.386
Okay.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.954
Now, I think I figured out
what is wrong with you,

26:04.998 --> 26:09.002
and this is the treatment.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.047
- It looks big.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.919
- Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

26:15.138 --> 26:18.228
So look, I went over
your landfill of symptoms

26:18.272 --> 26:21.188
a million times, and...

26:21.231 --> 26:23.799
the only diagnosis
I could come to

26:23.843 --> 26:25.366
was malnutrition.

26:27.368 --> 26:31.285
Now, Eli, are you
having trouble buying food?

26:31.328 --> 26:34.070
- My Social Security check
pays most of my rent,

26:34.114 --> 26:36.986
but to cover the rest of it,

26:37.030 --> 26:38.988
I sell my food stamps,

26:39.032 --> 26:42.557
and eat fast food
'cause it's cheap.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.168
- Okay.

26:45.212 --> 26:49.085
Well, look, you can't do that
anymore.

26:49.129 --> 26:50.391
- I knew I was cutting corners,

26:50.434 --> 26:53.133
I didn't know I was hurting
myself.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.961
- What about the shelter?

26:55.004 --> 26:57.354
I mean, they offer
three healthy meals a day.

26:57.398 --> 27:00.009
- I won't take food away

27:00.053 --> 27:02.055
from people who really need it!

27:02.098 --> 27:04.405
- You really need it.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.886
I mean, your body
is basically starving.

27:09.932 --> 27:13.240
Have you heard of something
called Meals for Seniors?

27:13.283 --> 27:15.851
I mean, it is a great program
that is designed to help

27:15.895 --> 27:17.374
with the nutritional needs
of the elderly.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.246
- I've been on a waitlist
since June.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.293
Of 2016.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.908
- I don't understand.
Why can't you find a match?

27:28.951 --> 27:30.039
- Your sister needs

27:30.083 --> 27:32.563
an extremely particular
blood product,

27:32.607 --> 27:35.958
and so far, no hospital
within 6 hours

27:36.002 --> 27:38.700
has it on hand.

27:38.744 --> 27:42.312
I'm so sorry, Justine.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.140
If there's any other
family members

27:44.184 --> 27:47.578
you wish to call,
now would be the time.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.581
- Elandra's a Marine.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.933
She did three tours
in Afghanistan,

27:53.976 --> 27:56.326
and now a commute to work
is going to kill her

27:56.370 --> 27:57.980
because you don't have blood?

28:03.594 --> 28:05.292
- You paged me?

28:05.335 --> 28:07.337
- Look, I know I'm stepping
over Castro,

28:07.381 --> 28:09.688
but my patient needs
all the help that she can get,

28:09.731 --> 28:11.298
and I'm not gonna let
chain of command

28:11.341 --> 28:14.170
get in the way
of saving her life.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.259
Will you help?

28:16.303 --> 28:18.435
- Ella.

28:18.479 --> 28:19.654
I have something for you.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.569
I realized mine
were a little old,

28:21.612 --> 28:23.223
so I thought maybe
these new ones

28:23.266 --> 28:25.399
will make you feel
more at home.

28:25.442 --> 28:28.532
- Vijay, I really appreciate
what you're doing.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.447
I just--

28:30.491 --> 28:31.448
your home?

28:31.492 --> 28:32.928
- You mean our home.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.277
- Yeah.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.236
There's so much
of your old life there,

28:36.279 --> 28:39.674
so much of everything,
really, and...

28:39.718 --> 28:41.284
I just--

28:41.328 --> 28:42.721
there's no space
for anyone else.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.070
There's no space for me.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.246
- Oh, we will move
Rohan's books.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.551
- It's not about the books.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.640
I just--

28:49.684 --> 28:51.251
feel like I picture myself
there,

28:51.294 --> 28:54.515
and I just--with my OCD,
and--

28:54.558 --> 28:56.952
I know that you are just
trying to be helpful,

28:56.996 --> 28:58.649
and that really means so much.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.651
I just--it's just not
gonna work for me.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.135
- I...

29:06.179 --> 29:08.355
I'm sorry I did not think of--

29:08.398 --> 29:10.531
- No, I'm sorry.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.533
I--

29:12.576 --> 29:14.100
you're being so great, and I--

29:14.143 --> 29:18.191
- You need to do what is best
for the baby, and--

29:18.234 --> 29:20.454
and for you.

29:20.497 --> 29:23.239
- I'll come by after my shift,
and I'll pick up my things.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.509
- Where will you go?

29:32.553 --> 29:35.425
- I'll go stay with a friend
till I figure it out.

29:40.517 --> 29:41.997
- Okay.

29:49.396 --> 29:50.484
- It's not cancer.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.399
It's not some obscure
infection.

29:52.442 --> 29:55.445
Luna has an epidermoid cyst,
a simple fold of tissue.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.708
A small injection of steroids
and she'll be fine.

29:59.536 --> 30:00.624
- That's great news.
Thank you.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.322
- But if I may, Dr. Goodwin,

30:02.365 --> 30:03.845
today you let
your parental fears

30:03.889 --> 30:06.717
override your medical judgment
and mine.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.545
- What do you mean?

30:08.589 --> 30:10.417
- From now on,
when Luna visits this office,

30:10.460 --> 30:12.375
I don't want her coming
with Dr. Goodwin.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.725
I want Luna coming
with her father.

30:17.337 --> 30:20.253
- Got it.

30:22.777 --> 30:25.127
- Okay.

30:25.171 --> 30:29.175
For your discharge,
my mountain-climbing friend.

30:29.218 --> 30:31.177
Here you go.
- Sweet, thank you.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.048
- So, listen, before you leave,
if you don't mind,

30:33.092 --> 30:36.051
I have one more shrink thought
for you.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.445
What do you say about making
a video for your parents?

30:40.403 --> 30:41.709
- What kind of video?

30:41.752 --> 30:43.406
- Well, when you leave,
and you say good-bye,

30:43.450 --> 30:44.625
your parents aren't going
to know

30:44.668 --> 30:47.062
that that's really good-bye,

30:47.106 --> 30:48.890
so why don't you give them
that gift?

30:48.934 --> 30:50.805
The real good-bye?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.676
And then when I receive word
that you've passed,

30:52.720 --> 30:55.418
I will make sure
that they get it.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.246
- Yeah.
Seems like a good idea.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.292
- Great, okay.
I'm gonna set this up.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.860
We'll get you off to Aconcagua
in no time, my friend.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.132
- What should I say?

31:13.175 --> 31:14.524
- I mean, that's up to you,
really,

31:14.568 --> 31:17.397
but try to remember that
when your parents see this,

31:17.440 --> 31:19.486
they're gonna be dealing
with the fact that you're gone.

31:19.529 --> 31:21.140
All right?
So--

31:21.183 --> 31:24.447
I don't know, maybe tell them
how you want to be remembered.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.319
Five most important memories.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.238
- Hi, Mom and Dad.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.501
Hi.

31:34.544 --> 31:37.417
When you see this,
I'll be gone,

31:37.460 --> 31:41.725
and I thought you'd like
to hear this message from me.

31:41.769 --> 31:43.814
Anyway,

31:43.858 --> 31:45.904
here are my five most important
memories.

31:51.561 --> 31:54.303
Okay.
Here's one.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.610
The day I got diagnosed
with cancer.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.177
We were driving home
from the hospital,

31:58.220 --> 32:00.440
and you offered to get me
ice cream.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.659
And I was 15, and trying to be
a tough guy or whatever,

32:02.703 --> 32:04.792
so I said no.

32:04.835 --> 32:07.447
But later that night,
you brought me some anyway.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.492
Rocky Road.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.799
And it had been years since I'd
asked you to get me ice cream,

32:11.842 --> 32:13.366
but you remembered
my favorite flavor,

32:13.409 --> 32:16.369
and that made me feel so good.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.330
Number two.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.464
Playing Toss the Trey
when I was little.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.553
Might be my first memory,
actually.

32:26.596 --> 32:27.858
Getting tossed up in the air,

32:27.902 --> 32:32.211
and not worrying
if you were gonna catch me.

32:32.254 --> 32:34.735
And...

32:39.696 --> 32:41.872
And...

32:41.916 --> 32:44.223
and Thanksgiving.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.964
When I tried to eat
Dad's stuffing after chemo,

32:46.007 --> 32:48.227
but I got sick, and I...

32:51.056 --> 32:54.537
And you had to help
clean me up.

32:54.581 --> 32:57.236
And I hated it, but I remember
having this thought of,

32:57.279 --> 32:59.934
"Jesus,

32:59.978 --> 33:02.284
what would I do if I didn't..."

33:07.986 --> 33:09.944
"If I didn't have you?"

33:18.866 --> 33:21.738
Could you--could you
press stop, please?

33:33.576 --> 33:35.796
- You hired unbudgeted
medical scribes?

33:35.839 --> 33:38.755
You cancelled clinics?
You forged Max's signature?

33:38.799 --> 33:40.453
Usually, I save my indignation
for Max,

33:40.496 --> 33:41.932
but this time,
you outdid even him.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.630
- Mm, it has been a busy day.

33:43.673 --> 33:44.805
- This isn't a game, Helen.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.546
You're on a branch
all by yourself,

33:46.589 --> 33:48.200
and if you don't want me
to run you

33:48.243 --> 33:50.289
out of this hospital for good,
you better start talking.

33:50.332 --> 33:51.551
- Do you mind walking
a bit faster?

33:51.594 --> 33:52.856
- I do mind.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.336
Did you learn nothing
from your recent demotion?

33:54.380 --> 33:55.903
- What I learned
is that sometimes

33:55.946 --> 33:57.644
we have to bend the rules
in order to help our patients,

33:57.687 --> 34:00.386
and it certainly helps that
I have no titles to stop me.

34:00.429 --> 34:01.517
- God, you sound just like him.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.302
- Good, because everything
I did today,

34:03.345 --> 34:04.738
Max would have done too.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.219
Patients are the most important
part of this hospital,

34:07.262 --> 34:08.829
the center of everything
that we do.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.222
- Believe it or not,

34:10.265 --> 34:12.659
emulating Max's reckless
and irresponsible behavior

34:12.702 --> 34:14.139
is not gonna win you
any points.

34:14.182 --> 34:17.316
And where the hell
are we even going?

34:22.364 --> 34:24.845
- Ma'am, inside this cooler,
you'll find the synthetic blood

34:24.888 --> 34:26.499
that you requested.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.501
- What's going on?
Who are you?

34:28.544 --> 34:30.894
- When the Marines found out
one of our own was down,

34:30.938 --> 34:31.982
we were determined to help.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.420
- Thank you, Colonel.

34:34.463 --> 34:35.551
You were saying?

34:35.595 --> 34:37.597
- That blood will help
Reynolds' patient?

34:37.640 --> 34:40.469
- It will.
- Then go!

34:40.513 --> 34:42.515
- Your call is very important.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.082
Please continue to hold,

34:44.125 --> 34:45.866
and the next available Meals
for Seniors representative

34:45.909 --> 34:46.867
will assist you.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.348
- Meals for Seniors.
This is Linda.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.698
- Hi, Linda,
this is Dr. Lauren Bloom

34:51.741 --> 34:53.003
over at New Amsterdam.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.397
I've got a patient
who is on your waitlist.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.660
- I'm sorry,
I know it's frustrating,

34:57.704 --> 34:59.445
but it can take years
for a client

34:59.488 --> 35:01.011
to work their way to the top.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.710
There's just too many
hungry elders.

35:03.753 --> 35:07.627
- Right.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.324
Well, look,
how much would it cost

35:09.368 --> 35:11.631
to wipe out the waitlist?

35:11.674 --> 35:12.936
- Are you trying to bribe me?

35:12.980 --> 35:14.416
- No.
No.

35:14.460 --> 35:15.896
I just wondered how much
it would cost

35:15.939 --> 35:18.638
to service everyone
who's been waiting?

35:18.681 --> 35:20.857
- That's a big number.

35:20.901 --> 35:22.685
- Try me.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.820
Oh, Eli.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.213
I called Meals for Seniors.

35:28.256 --> 35:29.823
Turns out they had an opening
after all.

35:35.524 --> 35:36.699
- Hey.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.005
- Hey!

35:38.048 --> 35:40.660
Bobbi just wanted to make sure
Luna was okay.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.358
- She is.
And Bobbi?

35:43.402 --> 35:45.534
- She is.
- Good.

35:45.578 --> 35:47.493
- That's my number.

35:47.536 --> 35:50.365
- Oh, I'm not really--

35:50.409 --> 35:51.888
- The number's for Luna.

35:51.932 --> 35:53.934
For a playdate.
- Playdate?

35:53.977 --> 35:55.544
- Yeah, you know,
babies on blankets,

35:55.588 --> 35:58.460
spilled Cheerios, toy battles.

35:58.504 --> 35:59.461
- Right.

35:59.505 --> 36:02.377
Playdate, yep.
Heard of those.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.293
- Yeah, welcome to the next
level of parenthood, Max.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.606
- You gave my sister
experimental blood.

36:13.649 --> 36:14.824
- Synthetic blood.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.783
It's used mainly
for battlefield injuries.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.785
- Which isn't actually blood
at all.

36:18.828 --> 36:21.570
Scientists take hemoglobin,

36:21.614 --> 36:22.963
the molecule
that carries oxygen,

36:23.006 --> 36:25.400
and they wrap it
in a polymer coating.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.402
Which means that
your sister's body

36:27.446 --> 36:28.708
gets the oxygen that it needs,

36:28.751 --> 36:31.537
but won't reject the blood
carrying it.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.539
- Elandra's responding well
to the treatment.

36:33.582 --> 36:37.282
She's gonna pull through.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.545
- I didn't know any of this
was an option.

36:39.588 --> 36:40.894
- It wasn't.

36:40.937 --> 36:43.636
But Dr. Sharpe
made it happen anyway.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.033
- Oh.

36:50.077 --> 36:51.078
- Thank you.

37:05.353 --> 37:06.963
- Floyd, you paged?

37:07.007 --> 37:08.487
- I don't know
how I'm gonna say this,

37:08.530 --> 37:12.491
so I'm gonna just say it.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.494
- Okay.

37:15.537 --> 37:18.845
- So Evie took this new job
in San Francisco,

37:18.888 --> 37:20.977
and it's everything
she's ever wanted,

37:21.021 --> 37:22.762
but it means it's gonna be
a lot of changes

37:22.805 --> 37:24.024
happening for us,

37:24.067 --> 37:25.504
and I just wanted to be
straight up with you

37:25.547 --> 37:28.420
about my future here.

37:28.463 --> 37:29.899
- Well, I think that's amazing.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.074
Yeah, I totally get it.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.554
And look, we'll make
whatever happens next

37:32.598 --> 37:34.426
as painless as possible.

37:34.469 --> 37:35.862
- I appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.037
- Thank you.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.995
- Sure.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.475
It's crazy.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.825
You and I have been linked
since my very first day here.

37:42.869 --> 37:43.870
You were my first hire.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.001
- Mm-hmm.
- You know that?

37:45.045 --> 37:46.176
- Mm-hmm.
- Best decision I ever made.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.482
- Oh, thanks.

37:47.526 --> 37:49.354
- Look, just know that
whatever you need from me,

37:49.397 --> 37:50.355
I got you.

37:50.398 --> 37:51.573
- I'm flattered, I really am,

37:51.617 --> 37:52.879
and I'm definitely gonna
take you up on that.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.576
- Good.
I know how brutal

37:54.620 --> 37:56.622
long distance
relationships can be.

37:56.665 --> 37:57.797
- Oh, no, no, I'm--

37:57.840 --> 37:59.364
- Just take a few weeks
and help Evie move

37:59.407 --> 38:00.495
and get settled and--

38:00.539 --> 38:01.757
- Max, that's very generous,
but that--

38:01.801 --> 38:03.063
- Yeah, well, good.
You deserve it.

38:03.106 --> 38:04.804
We'll make it work,
for both of you.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.762
Right? We got this.
All right?

38:06.806 --> 38:09.025
'Cause teamwork
makes the dream work!

38:09.069 --> 38:10.418
Right, buddy?

38:17.251 --> 38:20.080
- How did you get him
to change his mind?

38:20.123 --> 38:21.734
- I didn't.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.910
I think Trey just realized that

38:23.953 --> 38:27.392
he can't finish his story
without them.

40:40.742 --> 40:44.093
Turns out I was the one
who needed a little help.

40:45.225 --> 40:47.096
- Did you get it?

40:47.140 --> 40:48.228
- Yeah.

40:48.271 --> 40:50.230
Think so.

40:50.273 --> 40:52.928
Oh, and I heard my "no screens"
idea went down without a hitch.

40:52.972 --> 40:54.277
- Indeed.

40:54.321 --> 40:55.757
Smooth as silk.
- Good.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.325
Best ideas usually are.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.718
Good night.

41:03.939 --> 41:05.245
- I'm kidding!
It was a joke.

41:05.288 --> 41:06.551
It was a disaster.

41:06.594 --> 41:10.163
- I heard it was horrible.

41:10.206 --> 41:11.730
I know.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.732
I know everything that you did.

41:13.775 --> 41:17.213
I know that my ideas only work

41:17.257 --> 41:18.780
because of you,

41:18.824 --> 41:20.216
and so, I just wanted to say--

41:20.260 --> 41:21.217
- No.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.262
- No?
- No.

41:22.305 --> 41:24.220
You were gonna thank me,
right?

41:24.264 --> 41:27.267
- I was.
- Good, no.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.834
Because I'm gonna thank you.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.966
- Why?

41:31.010 --> 41:33.099
- I finally felt
what you must feel

41:33.142 --> 41:34.927
every time you turn
this hospital on its head,

41:34.970 --> 41:35.971
and it is quite the rush.

41:36.015 --> 41:38.017
It is thrilling!

41:38.060 --> 41:39.235
And I want more of it.

41:39.279 --> 41:41.063
I want it every day.

41:41.107 --> 41:43.283
But Max, I have been
your safety net for so long

41:43.326 --> 41:44.763
that if I go down this road,

41:44.806 --> 41:46.895
I am gonna need you
to start being mine.

41:50.769 --> 41:53.815
- How can I help?
