<i>Caleb: My name is Caleb Rivers.</i>

00:02.781 --> 00:04.671
<i>Last night I got on a bus to Ravenswood,</i>

00:04.689 --> 00:06.830
<i>thinking I was going there
to help my girlfriend Hannah.</i>

00:06.852 --> 00:09.068
<i>She's the one who asked me to
stay and take care of Miranda.</i>

00:09.070 --> 00:10.591
<i>Miranda: I came to Ravenswood</i>

00:10.684 --> 00:12.353
<i>to find my only living relative.</i>

00:12.355 --> 00:14.121
I'm Miranda. I'm your niece.

00:14.123 --> 00:15.690
<i>Caleb: I found a tombstone in that cemetery</i>

00:15.692 --> 00:18.392
<i>with my name and face on it.</i>

00:18.394 --> 00:21.696
<i>And there's a dead
Miranda buried there too.</i>

00:21.698 --> 00:22.897
What is he hiding?

00:22.899 --> 00:24.198
I want answers.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.035
This belonged to your mother.

00:28.037 --> 00:29.936
<i>Miranda: "My dearest Miranda,</i>

00:29.938 --> 00:32.271
<i>your father and I can't
wait for you to be born,</i>

00:32.273 --> 00:34.574
<i>to see your face, your eyes."</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:36.242
I heard your mom's back home.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.945
Yeah, she got back from
Afghanistan a couple days ago.

00:38.947 --> 00:41.314
I don't want you seeing
him anymore, period.

00:41.316 --> 00:42.949
Is this your relative?

00:42.951 --> 00:45.485
I found this picture.

00:45.487 --> 00:47.620
Luke: The cops need to
know about this, mom.

00:47.622 --> 00:49.555
What, because they've
been so helpful to us?

00:49.557 --> 00:51.257
Somebody killed dad

00:51.259 --> 00:53.226
and there's no one else
on their radar but mom.

00:53.228 --> 00:56.395
I get why you're sad.

00:56.397 --> 00:58.764
Why are you so damn mad?

00:58.766 --> 01:00.399
I think mom did it.

01:00.401 --> 01:02.400
I think she killed dad.

01:02.402 --> 01:04.369
(Applause, Olivia gasps)

01:05.804 --> 01:07.305
Look out!

01:07.307 --> 01:10.242
(Screaming)

01:11.444 --> 01:13.445
(Thunder)

01:16.815 --> 01:19.683

Cpr administered on scene, non-responsive.

01:34.098 --> 01:37.267
BP 90 over 50. Unresponsive to command.

01:37.269 --> 01:39.001
Not sure how long she was under the water.

01:39.003 --> 01:40.236
Coming through!

01:42.773 --> 01:44.940
(Indistinct announcement over pa system)

01:44.942 --> 01:46.809
- What happened?
- It wasn't my fault.

01:46.811 --> 01:48.444
Miranda grabbed the wheel.

01:48.446 --> 01:50.146
Luke: She could have killed us.

01:50.148 --> 01:51.781
What's wrong with her?

01:51.783 --> 01:53.482
There must have been something in the road.

01:53.484 --> 01:55.617
There was nothing in the
road, I would have seen it.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.854
Man: Let's go people!

01:58.856 --> 02:00.056
We may need to intubate.

02:01.858 --> 02:03.993
No. No.

02:03.995 --> 02:07.195
Man: Not sure how long she was under for.

(Raven shrieking, thunder)

02:50.771 --> 02:53.005
You're still shaking.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.774
I keep thinking about being in the water,

02:55.776 --> 02:57.675
not knowing which way was up.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.444
We're okay.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.346
Not all of us.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.181
She must have seen something in the road.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.750
The road was empty.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.052
- Something that you missed.
- Caleb, the road was clear.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.519
She grabbed the wheel
and the next thing I know

03:08.521 --> 03:10.054
my car is full of river.

03:12.624 --> 03:14.524
At least I thought it was clear.

03:14.526 --> 03:16.093
Man: Remy Beaumont?

03:16.095 --> 03:17.962
I'm going to draw a blood sample now, okay?

03:17.964 --> 03:19.429
Okay.

03:19.431 --> 03:20.898
I think you should wait

03:20.900 --> 03:22.900
until her parents get here and ask them.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.568
I don't mind.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.136
I do.

03:26.138 --> 03:28.071
All of these people, they
just need to back off.

03:28.073 --> 03:29.572
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, man.

03:29.574 --> 03:30.974
You take it easy.

03:30.976 --> 03:33.910
Look, all I do is draw the blood, okay?

03:33.912 --> 03:35.711
Well, right now what you're
gonna do is you're gonna take

03:35.713 --> 03:38.047
your tubes and your needles
and your little squeezy ball

03:38.049 --> 03:39.715
and you are gonna wait.

03:39.717 --> 03:42.050
Beddington: Why don't we all calm down?

03:42.052 --> 03:44.552
Let's not make this any
tougher than it already is.

03:47.456 --> 03:48.423
Who's your friend?

03:51.727 --> 03:54.062
I don't know this kid.

03:54.064 --> 03:55.563
- Remy: Dad!
- Remy.

03:55.565 --> 03:57.099
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

03:57.101 --> 03:58.800
The car's in the river.

03:58.802 --> 04:01.068
It's okay. You're safe now.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.373
You were in the car.

04:08.243 --> 04:10.744
I made it clear to Remy, now
I'll make it clear to you.

04:10.746 --> 04:14.080
I want you and your sister
to stay away from my daughter.

04:14.082 --> 04:15.615
Girl died in the accident, Simon.

04:15.617 --> 04:17.350
Remy was driving.

04:17.351 --> 04:18.750
Who was killed?

04:18.753 --> 04:20.921
My friend.

04:20.923 --> 04:22.789
How did it happen?

04:22.791 --> 04:24.357
That's what we're all trying to figure out.

04:24.359 --> 04:28.128
Let's avoid any unnecessary diversions.

04:28.130 --> 04:29.595
- Rochelle: Thank God.
- Olivia: Mom.

04:29.597 --> 04:31.130
They said there was an accident.

04:31.132 --> 04:33.332
- Oh, you all right?
- Yeah.

04:33.334 --> 04:36.035
Remy's car went in the river.

04:36.037 --> 04:37.102
One of them's dead.

04:37.104 --> 04:39.271
Were you driving?

04:39.273 --> 04:42.507
- Leave her alone, Rochelle.
- Was she driving?

04:42.509 --> 04:44.643
We're not gonna get into this right now.

04:44.645 --> 04:45.644
Why's the chief of police here?

04:45.646 --> 04:47.212
Doing my job, Mrs. Matheson.

04:47.214 --> 04:49.380
Which would be a lot easier
if you let me handle things.

04:49.382 --> 04:51.782
I have no desire to make your job easier.

04:51.784 --> 04:53.384
Why do you suppose that is?

05:06.164 --> 05:07.664
Something I can do for you?

05:07.666 --> 05:10.868
Um...

05:10.870 --> 05:13.971
Yeah, I'm... I'm looking
for someone, and...

05:13.973 --> 05:17.640
and I think they're... they're here.

05:17.642 --> 05:20.476
You were in the accident,
with the mayor's kids.

05:20.478 --> 05:21.543
The mayor's kids?

05:21.545 --> 05:23.145
Yeah, Luke and Olivia Matheson.

05:23.453 --> 05:26.321
Their dad was the mayor,
till somebody killed him.

05:26.323 --> 05:28.623
Is... is my friend here?

05:28.625 --> 05:30.325
Her body?

05:30.327 --> 05:34.062
They sent down a Jane Doe
about, oh, half an hour ago.

05:34.064 --> 05:36.197
She's not Jane Doe.

05:36.199 --> 05:38.399
Her name is Miranda Collins.

05:38.401 --> 05:41.468
Okay, Miranda... Collins.

05:41.470 --> 05:44.905
Take care of this right now.

05:57.851 --> 06:01.688
Uh, can I hang out here
for a couple of minutes?

06:01.690 --> 06:05.825
Well, uh... you're not supposed to.

06:06.007 --> 06:09.241
Right, but can I?

06:09.243 --> 06:11.410
Sure. Have a seat.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.112
Sorry about your friend.

06:13.114 --> 06:14.046
Thanks.

06:19.386 --> 06:24.022
Listen, you want half
a tuna salad sandwich?

06:24.024 --> 06:26.590
Yeah, yeah. That'd be great. Thanks.

06:26.592 --> 06:28.092
Lunch pail's in my locker.

06:28.094 --> 06:29.660
I'll be right back.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.850
(Rattling)

06:54.985 --> 06:57.753
(Radio turns on)

06:57.755 --> 07:00.689
(Static, country music plays)

07:07.331 --> 07:08.530
(Door opens)

08:38.082 --> 08:46.189
(*)

08:54.999 --> 08:56.967
Wait, now why was he in the car?

08:56.969 --> 08:58.635
We saw Olivia and Luke walking

08:58.637 --> 09:00.303
and we stopped for them.

09:00.305 --> 09:02.238
I told you... I told
you to stay clear of him.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.639
It was raining.

09:03.641 --> 09:05.007
And they were at the side of the road.

09:05.009 --> 09:06.409
I couldn't just leave them there.

09:06.411 --> 09:08.578
What about the other boy
and the girl who died?

09:08.580 --> 09:10.045
I met them in town for the parade.

09:10.047 --> 09:12.382
- Do you think I wanted this to happen?
- Simon.

09:12.384 --> 09:13.719
Leave it alone.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.528
No, somebody's gotta ask these questions.

09:15.530 --> 09:18.130
It doesn't have to be you
and it doesn't have to be now.

09:46.558 --> 09:49.726
I thought Marie shopped on Fridays.

09:49.933 --> 09:53.368
Marie doesn't come anymore.

09:53.370 --> 09:56.304
She quit. Remember?

09:58.941 --> 10:01.276
I'm sorry I haven't been much help...

10:01.278 --> 10:04.878
Since your father died. That's over.

10:04.880 --> 10:09.250
Okay, we're gonna get
through this, together.

10:09.252 --> 10:11.352
First off, I don't want
you talking to the police,

10:11.354 --> 10:13.287
and don't talk to Remy.

10:13.289 --> 10:16.357
Her dad's newspaper is in
Chief Beddington's back pocket.

10:18.059 --> 10:20.360
Olivia, I heard about what
happened at the parade.

10:20.362 --> 10:21.794
Are you all right?

10:21.866 --> 10:23.633
How did you hear about that?

10:23.635 --> 10:26.336
Tess called. She was worried.

10:26.338 --> 10:27.537
And she wanted me to tell you

10:27.539 --> 10:29.071
you were elected homecoming queen.

10:31.475 --> 10:32.809
What?

10:34.478 --> 10:36.278
(Laughs)

10:38.381 --> 10:40.615
It's my lucky day.

10:43.953 --> 10:46.488
(Crying)

10:46.490 --> 10:48.990
Don't cry.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.561
(Sniffling)

10:53.563 --> 10:54.962
It's gonna be okay.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.407
(Radio turns on, "The one that
got away" by Civil Wars plays)

11:06.409 --> 11:08.909
Is this supposed to be
a dream of something?

11:14.065 --> 11:16.033
Does it feel like a dream?

11:21.372 --> 11:22.505
No.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.742
Then it must be something else.

11:26.744 --> 11:29.111
I... I'm new at this.

11:29.113 --> 11:32.048
Listen, Caleb, what did you do with my bag?

11:33.283 --> 11:34.883
Your bag?

11:34.885 --> 11:37.786
You need stuff from my bag.

11:37.788 --> 11:40.589
Miranda, what happened?

11:44.827 --> 11:46.061
That happened.

11:46.063 --> 11:47.329
(Thunder)

11:48.664 --> 11:49.797
Oh!

11:49.799 --> 11:50.966
(Gasps)

11:50.968 --> 11:52.834
Are you all right?

11:52.836 --> 11:55.403
I must have been dreaming.

11:55.405 --> 11:59.239
Well, when we sleep, our minds
open to all manner of stimuli.

11:59.241 --> 12:02.809
Like I said... a dream.

12:02.811 --> 12:05.245
Or a thing we call "dream."

12:08.016 --> 12:10.817
You haven't tried to
call Hanna yet, have you?

12:10.819 --> 12:12.252
No, I haven't.

12:15.422 --> 12:18.291
Well, Hanna was here looking for Alison,

12:18.293 --> 12:19.993
but Alison's gone.

12:19.995 --> 12:21.894
And she's not coming back.

12:24.031 --> 12:26.032
Exactly what is it you do here?

12:26.034 --> 12:27.433
Exactly?

12:27.435 --> 12:29.334
I keep things in order.

12:29.336 --> 12:33.338
Help when help is required.

12:33.340 --> 12:37.476
Finish up your tea and
try to get a real rest.

12:41.647 --> 12:42.981
Where is he?

12:45.117 --> 12:46.484
He's working.

12:49.221 --> 12:50.654
On what?

12:50.656 --> 12:53.124
Don't worry. He's an artist.

12:53.126 --> 12:57.128
He will show her remains
the utmost respect.

12:59.131 --> 13:02.465
But Caleb, remember...

13:02.467 --> 13:05.402
her body is a shell now.

13:05.404 --> 13:09.406
Miranda is elsewhere.

13:09.408 --> 13:11.674
With all due respect,

13:11.676 --> 13:18.013
I don't believe in any of that
life-after-death soul crap.

13:18.015 --> 13:20.382
Well, fortunately...

13:20.384 --> 13:22.251
the existence of the soul

13:22.253 --> 13:27.889
isn't dependent on your limited experience.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.759
There's macaroons on the tray.

13:34.596 --> 13:35.796
(Door closes)

13:42.671 --> 13:44.872
Remy: "Laboratory accident kills five."

13:44.874 --> 13:47.341
(Sighs)

13:47.343 --> 13:48.509
"Explosion at school."

13:51.912 --> 13:55.848
(Muttering) "Laboratory
accident kills five."

13:55.850 --> 13:57.984
Five. Why is it always five?

14:00.388 --> 14:01.621
(Clattering)

14:03.924 --> 14:05.724
(Clattering continues)

14:18.238 --> 14:19.871
(No audible dialogue)

14:22.575 --> 14:25.510
(Crickets chirping)

14:31.718 --> 14:33.451
My dad doesn't want me talking to you.

14:33.453 --> 14:35.921
My mom doesn't want me talking to you.

14:35.923 --> 14:37.422
Well, at least there's
something they agree on.

14:37.424 --> 14:39.323
(Chuckles)

14:39.325 --> 14:40.891
What are we going to do about that, huh?

14:40.893 --> 14:42.226
I don't know.

14:47.298 --> 14:48.965
You threw pebbles at my window.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.634
(Both chuckle)

14:50.636 --> 14:54.804
Yeah, yeah. Well, my phone was wrecked.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.340
I figured yours was, too.

14:58.009 --> 15:00.010
That's how they did it in the old days.

15:00.012 --> 15:02.478
Well, you're a very romantic person.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.648
Don't tell anybody though,
'cause it'll ruin my image.

15:05.650 --> 15:07.350
(Laughs) Our secret.

15:21.664 --> 15:23.431
I almost lost you.

15:23.433 --> 15:24.683
She grabbed the wheel out of my hand,

15:24.685 --> 15:26.564
- there was nothing I could do...
- It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

15:26.568 --> 15:28.637
I saw the way your mom
looked at me at the hospital.

15:28.639 --> 15:29.771
Mm-mmm.

15:29.773 --> 15:31.373
(Chuckles) Mm-mmm.

15:35.277 --> 15:37.778
No more talking for the night, okay?

15:37.780 --> 15:39.079
Okay.

15:55.896 --> 15:59.165
(Metallic clanging)

16:24.356 --> 16:27.291
(Muffled whispering)

16:44.442 --> 16:46.743
Caleb: "Not I, not anyone else

16:46.745 --> 16:48.345
can travel that road for you.

16:48.347 --> 16:51.114
You must travel it yourself"

16:51.116 --> 16:53.716
(rattling)

16:57.754 --> 16:59.020
Caleb: "It is not far.

16:59.022 --> 17:00.522
It is within reach.

17:00.524 --> 17:01.890
Perhaps you have been on it

17:01.892 --> 17:03.024
since you were born, and did not know."

17:06.929 --> 17:08.929
(Rumbling)

17:08.931 --> 17:11.633
(Clattering)

17:18.973 --> 17:20.441
(Gasps)

17:20.443 --> 17:23.844
(Panting)

17:39.965 --> 17:42.099
Why are you giving me this now?

17:42.101 --> 17:44.001
Because we almost didn't
make it home alive last night.

17:44.003 --> 17:45.269
You have the right to know about that.

17:45.271 --> 17:48.139
She's downstairs, making breakfast.

17:48.141 --> 17:50.507
Can't you let things be
all right for one day?

17:50.509 --> 17:55.145
No. I can't because it's not all right.

17:55.147 --> 17:57.346
Dad wrote that letter to mom.

17:57.348 --> 18:01.851
Read where he says, "I'm afraid
of what's happening to us."

18:01.853 --> 18:03.452
Where did you get this?

18:03.454 --> 18:05.822
Just... read it.

18:12.796 --> 18:14.529
I think mom was cheating.

18:14.531 --> 18:16.364
- Stop.
- Read.

18:16.366 --> 18:17.833
"I can't explain this thing,

18:17.835 --> 18:19.701
but I know it's there
and we have to face it."

18:19.703 --> 18:21.036
That could mean anything.

18:21.038 --> 18:22.337
He was alone at the office,

18:22.339 --> 18:23.738
she was the last one to see him,

18:23.740 --> 18:26.174
she can't explain where she was after that

18:26.176 --> 18:29.678
and I have a feeling there was something
really bad going on between them.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.779
(Paper ripping)

18:37.687 --> 18:39.487
Yeah, we met her Uncle.

18:39.489 --> 18:41.422
He's a... piece of work.

18:41.424 --> 18:45.025
She's... she's go..

18:45.027 --> 18:49.596
she's, um... actually at her Uncle's house.

18:49.598 --> 18:50.997
It's really complicated, Hanna.

18:54.602 --> 18:56.169
Hey, I gotta go.

18:56.171 --> 18:58.904
I'll call you when I can, okay?

18:58.906 --> 19:00.072
All right. Don't worry.

19:00.074 --> 19:01.374
I love you.

19:01.376 --> 19:02.908
(Phone beeps)

19:02.910 --> 19:05.244
Remy.

19:05.246 --> 19:06.512
Hey.

19:06.514 --> 19:07.880
Hi.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.751
I don't know what that means anymore.

19:11.753 --> 19:13.985
Me neither.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.726
(Sighs)

19:20.728 --> 19:23.061
Listen, I need your help.

19:23.063 --> 19:25.964
Miranda's bag, it's in your car,

19:25.966 --> 19:27.699
I have to get it back.

19:27.701 --> 19:29.099
There are some things in it...

19:29.101 --> 19:31.201
some things that belonged to Miranda.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.970
Well, it's at Drexell's junkyard.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.905
I don't think the police
have even looked at it yet.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.774
Do you think we can get in there?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.042
I'm sure police are gonna wanna
take a look at the car first.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.078
There's nothing in it that the police want.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.213
What's in this bag that's so important?

19:43.215 --> 19:46.916
It's hard to explain.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.787
It'll have to be after school,

19:50.789 --> 19:52.154
after I finish work at the paper,

19:52.156 --> 19:53.590
but we can go later.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.124
Okay. Good.

19:55.126 --> 19:57.494
I'll meet you in town, at the coffee shop.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.929
Okay.

20:01.230 --> 20:02.264
Caleb.

20:06.068 --> 20:09.004
What I was telling you the other night...

20:12.275 --> 20:14.376
I think I might have found out more.

20:16.612 --> 20:21.248
(Indistinct chatter)

20:32.860 --> 20:35.161
One question.

20:35.163 --> 20:37.196
Did you dump that bucket
of crap on my sister?

20:37.198 --> 20:40.266
Don't you get tired of
cleaning up after your family?

20:40.268 --> 20:42.436
Was it you?

20:42.438 --> 20:44.504
Seriously, this is really pathetic.

20:44.506 --> 20:46.372
Aren't you embarrassed?

20:46.374 --> 20:49.207
Five seconds and I'm cramming
you in one of those lockers.

20:49.209 --> 20:51.644
You think I'm the only one
that you have to worry about?

20:51.646 --> 20:53.312
Guess again.

20:53.314 --> 20:57.215
People are wising up
to that family of yours.

20:57.217 --> 20:59.017
The cracks are showing.

20:59.019 --> 21:01.353
And I'm not the only
one with a sledgehammer.

21:01.355 --> 21:03.589
(Chuckles)

21:07.159 --> 21:09.193
(Whistle blows)

21:09.195 --> 21:10.895
I've been asking around.

21:10.897 --> 21:12.831
And I'm gonna find that creep
who threw the stuff at you

21:12.833 --> 21:13.965
at the parade and make him pay.

21:13.967 --> 21:15.834
It doesn't matter.

21:17.803 --> 21:19.303
I tried to visit you.

21:19.305 --> 21:21.171
Your mom said you were resting.

21:21.173 --> 21:22.105
I was.

21:24.576 --> 21:25.709
Are you okay?

21:25.711 --> 21:28.411
I will be now.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.484
Hey now, watch the
P.D.A.s on school property.

21:33.486 --> 21:36.752
I said I wasn't going
to cry when I saw you.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.054
Fat chance.

21:39.056 --> 21:40.857
It's all right.

21:40.859 --> 21:42.424
What's in the bag?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.393
Your replacement gown for the photo shoot.

21:44.395 --> 21:46.161
Your royal portrait.

21:46.163 --> 21:47.729
The one we didn't get
to take the other night.

21:47.731 --> 21:50.232
You do realize, people just felt sorry

21:50.234 --> 21:52.334
for me after what happened at the parade.

21:52.336 --> 21:53.702
That's why they voted for me.

21:53.704 --> 21:55.604
You're safe, that's worth

21:55.606 --> 21:57.672
celebrating with a dozen crowns.

22:10.919 --> 22:14.122
Our parents won't be happy if they
know we're talking to each other.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.455
Yeah, well, we go to the same school.

22:15.457 --> 22:17.224
They can't do much about that.

22:17.226 --> 22:19.226
Your dad dedicated that new lab.

22:19.228 --> 22:21.261
Yeah, it was a big deal for him.

22:21.263 --> 22:22.562
He was a student here
when the fire happened.

22:22.564 --> 22:24.231
Can you sneak out tonight?

22:24.233 --> 22:25.432
(Giggles)

22:25.434 --> 22:27.401
I have to take Caleb to Drexell's.

22:27.403 --> 22:28.468
He needs something out of my car.

22:28.470 --> 22:29.569
Don't do it.

22:29.571 --> 22:31.603
- I promised.
- Unpromise.

22:31.605 --> 22:33.406
Don't get messed up with that kid.

22:33.408 --> 22:34.940
Luke, his friend died.

22:34.942 --> 22:36.642
He's alone in town and he asked for help.

22:36.644 --> 22:38.077
The five of us were in that car together.

22:38.079 --> 22:41.213
Do you really expect
us to just cut him off?

22:41.215 --> 22:42.881
I'm sorry about his friend, I really am,

22:42.883 --> 22:44.216
but I'm more concerned about you.

22:44.218 --> 22:45.251
Just tell him you can't do it.

22:45.253 --> 22:48.453
(Bell rings)

22:48.455 --> 22:50.789
I have to go.

22:50.791 --> 22:52.558
Don't do it.

23:03.235 --> 23:04.735
Thanks.

23:09.441 --> 23:12.443
You looked like you could use a refill.

23:14.245 --> 23:15.546
How long did you know that girl?

23:17.849 --> 23:19.583
Not long.

23:19.585 --> 23:22.485
Long enough to know if she
had any emotional problems?

23:22.487 --> 23:25.017
Something that would make her want to drive

23:25.018 --> 23:26.602
into a river with a car full of people?

23:29.627 --> 23:32.762
Look, people at the hospital

23:32.764 --> 23:34.931
heard you talking to Remy Beaumont.

23:34.933 --> 23:36.364
Heard her say your friend grabbed the wheel

23:36.366 --> 23:38.366
and forced that car off the road.

23:38.368 --> 23:41.937
She wasn't trying to kill herself.

23:41.939 --> 23:44.439
You came in on that bus together

23:44.441 --> 23:46.108
but you didn't get on together.

23:46.110 --> 23:47.342
I checked.

23:47.344 --> 23:50.178
We met on the bus, so what?

23:50.180 --> 23:54.048
So, you knew her, what, a day and a half.

23:54.050 --> 23:57.785
That's not long.

23:57.787 --> 24:02.556
My guess is you only knew
what she wanted you to know.

24:02.558 --> 24:06.494
She was a runaway, did she tell you that?

24:06.496 --> 24:08.161
More checking?

24:08.163 --> 24:10.831
Let me tell you what I think:

24:10.833 --> 24:14.200
I think that girl had a lot of
problems you don't know about.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.671
I think you're lucky to be
sitting here drinking coffee.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.974
Chalk it up to experience
and head back to Rosewood.

24:27.147 --> 24:30.916
(Heaving breathing)

24:35.822 --> 24:37.857
(Exhales)

24:43.529 --> 24:44.529
Really funny...

24:44.531 --> 24:46.931
(Grunts)

24:50.369 --> 24:53.104
(Groaning)

24:54.406 --> 24:55.673
What are you doing here in the dark, man?

24:56.741 --> 24:58.275
(Grunts)

25:10.902 --> 25:13.003
(Water running)

25:15.239 --> 25:16.706
Is he still here?

25:16.708 --> 25:18.541
He went out early.

25:20.443 --> 25:22.945
Do you think he'll want to stay?

25:22.947 --> 25:24.647
It's a possibility.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.650
He has questions.

25:27.652 --> 25:31.453
Everybody his age has questions.

25:31.455 --> 25:34.156
When they get older, they
learn to stop asking them.

25:34.158 --> 25:36.291
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

25:36.293 --> 25:38.626
We leave all these questions around

25:38.628 --> 25:39.995
for children to trip over.

25:42.165 --> 25:46.968
Oh, is there something wrong with the soup?

25:46.970 --> 25:49.570
It has too much advice mixed in it.

26:01.416 --> 26:03.684
When you went to the hospital,

26:03.686 --> 26:07.353
how many bodies did you expect to find?

26:13.660 --> 26:15.261
I thought you said it would be open.

26:15.263 --> 26:16.996
It's supposed to be. The tow truck's gone.

26:16.998 --> 26:18.965
Mr. Drexell must have gotten a job.

26:18.967 --> 26:20.433
We can try tomorrow before school.

26:23.203 --> 26:24.136
Um...

26:40.685 --> 26:42.220
Simple.

26:42.222 --> 26:43.721
Come on.

26:43.723 --> 26:45.322
(Dogs barking) Oh!

26:46.491 --> 26:47.759
Caleb!

26:49.661 --> 26:50.762
Remy: Caleb, be careful!

27:01.205 --> 27:05.575
(Muffled barking)

27:13.383 --> 27:16.652
I told him to adjust the lights so
the rhinestones would stand out better.

27:16.654 --> 27:18.821
You ready to be immortalized?

27:18.823 --> 27:20.422
Not really.

27:20.424 --> 27:22.892
Well, smile anyway.

27:22.894 --> 27:25.426
I've been smiling all day.

27:25.428 --> 27:26.694
My face hurts from smiling.

27:28.998 --> 27:32.834
Tess, I don't think I
can do this. The photo...

27:32.836 --> 27:36.704
I've been trying to talk myself
into it all day, I... I can't.

27:36.706 --> 27:39.841
Livy, it is a good idea.

27:39.843 --> 27:41.208
It's a great idea.

27:41.210 --> 27:43.410
I mean, a lot of people voted for you.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.213
I'm tired of being the public
face for my whole family.

27:46.215 --> 27:50.050
I'm tired of smiling and being brave...

27:50.052 --> 27:53.854
pretending everything is okay.

27:53.856 --> 27:57.456
Sometimes pretending is
the only way to get through.

27:57.458 --> 28:01.260
How am I supposed to pretend
my father wasn't murdered?

28:01.262 --> 28:04.596
Or that half the town
thinks my mother killed him?

28:04.598 --> 28:07.700
I don't know, but you have to try.

28:07.702 --> 28:10.402
Do it for yourself, Livy.
I mean, you've been through

28:10.404 --> 28:12.104
more crap than anyone
else in this entire school.

28:12.106 --> 28:13.972
People care about you.

28:14.044 --> 28:17.545
Plus tomorrow might be half
an inch better than yesterday.

28:17.547 --> 28:20.382
So, one more smile. You're the queen.

28:20.384 --> 28:23.051
You can afford to be generous.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.054
I'll go see if he's ready.

28:31.393 --> 28:33.093
(Sighs)

28:36.497 --> 28:38.146
(Phone beeping)

28:44.184 --> 28:46.202
___

28:55.882 --> 28:57.583
Livy?

29:07.727 --> 29:09.661
Three wars, no soldiers die,

29:09.663 --> 29:11.228
but when the wars over
and the soldiers come home,

29:11.230 --> 29:13.364
something happens to five kids in town.

29:13.366 --> 29:14.599
Explain that.

29:14.601 --> 29:16.100
If you're right,

29:16.102 --> 29:18.937
shouldn't we all be dead
and not just Miranda?

29:18.939 --> 29:20.905
I guess so.

29:20.942 --> 29:25.711
Hey, you're alive, don't
sound so disappointed.

29:25.713 --> 29:28.213
Maybe we were all supposed
to die and we didn't.

29:28.215 --> 29:31.282
But why not?

29:31.284 --> 29:33.318
Well, maybe the universe blinked.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.420
Sometimes you get the
wrong pizza delivered,

29:35.422 --> 29:37.890
you don't think the cosmos
screws up every once in a while?

29:39.993 --> 29:42.292
Hey, I think I see your car.

29:42.294 --> 29:45.229
Oh, that's it. Poor Rhoda.

29:45.231 --> 29:47.398
Rhoda?

29:47.400 --> 29:49.567
Rhoda the road warrior.

29:49.569 --> 29:51.068
What, you don't name your cars?

29:51.070 --> 29:53.103
(Chuckles) Nope.

29:53.105 --> 29:55.940
I like to keep the
relationship strictly business.

30:07.685 --> 30:09.786
Um, I'm gonna go find something
to break the windshield.

30:09.788 --> 30:11.454
(Train whistle blows in distance)

30:11.456 --> 30:13.522
It's okay. She's not gonna feel any pain.

30:13.524 --> 30:15.123
(Chuckles)

30:27.370 --> 30:29.037
<i>- (Radio turns on)
- * now hear this *</i>

30:29.039 --> 30:31.372
<i>* which one of you is afraid to die *</i>

30:31.374 --> 30:32.974
<i>* just like those cowards... *</i>

30:32.976 --> 30:34.341
Help!

30:34.343 --> 30:35.810
Caleb!

30:47.358 --> 30:48.291
Caleb: Close your eyes, Remy.

30:49.526 --> 30:51.461
(Both grunting)

30:51.463 --> 30:52.728
I got you.

30:53.930 --> 30:55.097
(Dog barking)

30:55.099 --> 30:56.699
Oh, God.

31:05.041 --> 31:06.074
(Shouts)

31:07.410 --> 31:10.212
Remy! Stay back!

31:10.214 --> 31:11.646
Remy: Luke!

31:11.648 --> 31:13.014
What...

31:14.984 --> 31:17.084
Go!

31:35.169 --> 31:36.870
(Panting) Thanks...

31:37.939 --> 31:39.272
Whoa, guys.

31:39.274 --> 31:41.008
Guys! Guys!

31:41.010 --> 31:42.208
Stop it!

31:43.309 --> 31:44.410
Stop it!

31:46.279 --> 31:47.780
You trying to get my
girlfriend killed, too?

31:47.782 --> 31:48.781
Huh?!

31:50.517 --> 31:52.952
Here. That what you
want? Take it. Let's go.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.020
You shouldn't have said that
to him, about his girlfriend.

31:54.022 --> 31:55.154
He had nothing to do with...

31:55.156 --> 31:56.422
Two times you were with that guy,

31:56.424 --> 31:57.757
two times you almost died.

31:57.759 --> 31:59.024
I'm not taking any more chances.

31:59.026 --> 32:00.091
All right?

32:04.530 --> 32:06.364
(Engine starts)

32:06.366 --> 32:09.300
(Dog barking)

32:12.504 --> 32:14.638
Tess, he's on your phone kissing you.

32:14.640 --> 32:15.873
That was a mistake.

32:15.875 --> 32:17.775
Kissing him or putting it on your phone?

32:17.777 --> 32:19.509
If it wasn't on my phone,
you wouldn't have seen it.

32:19.511 --> 32:21.845
You still would have kissed him.

32:21.847 --> 32:24.214
Springer hates me. He
hates my whole family.

32:24.216 --> 32:26.283
I liked him before he started hating you.

32:26.285 --> 32:27.985
And I still like him, okay?

32:27.987 --> 32:29.853
He's no Dillon, but
he's a dependable B-plus.

32:29.855 --> 32:31.020
Is that all you care about?

32:31.022 --> 32:33.890
Where he is on the boyfriend pyramid?

32:33.892 --> 32:35.558
Don't be selfish, Livy.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.927
I got you that crown, let
me enjoy some of the spoils.

32:41.331 --> 32:43.132
Luke was right.

32:43.134 --> 32:44.366
About what?

32:44.368 --> 32:47.335
Here...

32:47.337 --> 32:48.837
It fits you better.

33:18.733 --> 33:19.866
What are doing here?

33:19.868 --> 33:22.201
That's a good question.

33:22.203 --> 33:23.937
You can't wander around.

33:23.939 --> 33:26.673
This is a place of business.

33:26.675 --> 33:30.543
There are dangerous chemicals
involved in the process.

33:30.545 --> 33:32.145
So I've noticed.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.587
When's the funeral?

33:42.589 --> 33:45.457
Day after tomorrow.

33:45.459 --> 33:47.960
I wanted to give her foster family a chance

33:47.962 --> 33:49.928
to change their minds about attending.

33:49.930 --> 33:51.629
Do you think they will?

33:51.731 --> 33:54.098
No.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.806
You can stay in the guest room.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.811
Till the service.

34:07.813 --> 34:08.945
If you want to.

34:11.715 --> 34:14.516
I will. Thanks.

34:26.062 --> 34:27.797
I'm sorry for your loss.

34:33.003 --> 34:34.703
Thank you.

34:47.116 --> 34:49.083
(Thunder)

34:49.085 --> 34:50.952
(Tires squealing)

34:50.954 --> 34:53.121
(Crashing)

34:53.123 --> 34:55.522
Woman: Remy!

34:55.524 --> 34:57.791
Remy!

34:57.793 --> 34:58.859
(Tires screech)

35:00.795 --> 35:02.429
Oh, God! Remy!

35:02.431 --> 35:03.630
Oh! Mom?

35:03.632 --> 35:04.932
- You're okay.
- Dad?

35:04.934 --> 35:05.966
Terry: You're okay.

35:05.968 --> 35:07.201
You were sleepwalking again.

35:07.203 --> 35:09.136
Oh, God.

35:13.907 --> 35:15.474
I'm sorry, sir. Everything okay?

35:35.859 --> 35:37.259
You're beautiful.

35:41.364 --> 35:43.698
The queen was getting her picture taken.

35:46.602 --> 35:49.470
I wish your father could see you.

35:49.472 --> 35:53.073
So do I.

36:07.354 --> 36:09.322
Mom, were you and dad
going to get a divorce?

36:09.324 --> 36:13.026
Who told you that?

36:13.028 --> 36:15.194
Is it true?

36:15.196 --> 36:19.197
Uh...

36:19.199 --> 36:22.902
I'm not gonna lie, we
were having a hard time.

36:22.904 --> 36:26.171
But, Olivia, we loved each other.

36:26.173 --> 36:28.407
Was there someone else?

36:32.411 --> 36:34.813
- What makes you...
- Was there?

36:37.883 --> 36:39.551
You need to go to bed.

36:39.553 --> 36:41.118
It's late.

36:56.668 --> 36:59.603
(Clock ticking)

37:24.527 --> 37:26.361
"The world can be a scary place

37:26.363 --> 37:28.730
and you have to be careful,

37:28.732 --> 37:32.767
but I don't want you to be afraid."

37:32.769 --> 37:35.970
"There are things you'll
like when you get here.

37:35.972 --> 37:39.106
Rain, the way apples crunch,

37:39.108 --> 37:40.975
come soon, Miranda.

37:40.977 --> 37:43.043
So I can start loving you even more.

37:45.914 --> 37:47.247
Your mom."

37:49.784 --> 37:51.718
Miranda: I need you to
stay really, really calm.

37:51.720 --> 37:53.486
No, no, no. It's okay.

37:56.323 --> 37:58.892
It worked.

37:58.894 --> 38:01.427
What worked?

38:01.429 --> 38:03.796
I heard you reading the letter.

38:03.798 --> 38:05.632
My mom's letter.

38:05.634 --> 38:07.733
I followed your voice.

38:07.735 --> 38:13.739
It was hard, then it was easy.

38:13.741 --> 38:15.841
Do the cops know?

38:15.843 --> 38:17.409
What about your Uncle?

38:17.411 --> 38:18.677
Know what?

38:18.679 --> 38:20.913
That you're back?

38:20.915 --> 38:26.918
Caleb, I'm not back.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.520
I'm dead.

38:29.522 --> 38:33.190
That's crazy.

38:33.192 --> 38:36.326
Yeah, well...

38:36.328 --> 38:38.262
I was sort of an atheist
before all of this,

38:38.264 --> 38:41.998
so imagine how I feel.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.801
What are you trying to tell me?

38:44.803 --> 38:47.270
I died in the water.

38:47.272 --> 38:49.420
Well, more specifically,
in the ambulance. But...

38:49.430 --> 38:52.475
No. They were working
on you in the hospital.

38:52.477 --> 38:55.411
I was long gone by then.

39:01.350 --> 39:02.751
How?

39:07.123 --> 39:10.626
Maybe it's this house.

39:10.628 --> 39:15.730
It's like, things can
move back and forth here.

39:15.732 --> 39:18.132
Miranda...

39:19.902 --> 39:25.406
If you're dead, why are you still here?

39:25.408 --> 39:28.208
I don't know.

39:28.210 --> 39:31.211
I'm sorry.

39:31.213 --> 39:33.080
About what?

39:33.082 --> 39:35.415
I couldn't save you.

39:43.524 --> 39:46.325
You tried.

39:46.327 --> 39:49.361
I appreciate that.

39:55.335 --> 39:59.671
Caleb, can I stay here with you?

39:59.673 --> 40:02.007
I'm stuck.

40:02.009 --> 40:03.742
Every time I try to go somewhere

40:03.744 --> 40:06.611
I always end up back in this house, and...

40:06.613 --> 40:09.514
it's scary out here.

40:09.516 --> 40:14.185
I hear things, see things.

40:14.187 --> 40:22.192
I think somebody's out here with me.

40:22.194 --> 40:24.728
Of course you can stay.

40:24.730 --> 40:27.031
Thank you.

40:30.535 --> 40:32.301
What does it feel like?

40:39.209 --> 40:42.645
Cold.

40:42.647 --> 40:47.116
Like, uh...

40:47.118 --> 40:50.118
like you're swimming... like
when you're swimming in the ocean

40:50.120 --> 40:54.455
and you swim into a cold current.

40:54.457 --> 40:57.959
It's like a wall.

40:57.961 --> 41:02.831
I try to touch things but I can't.

41:02.833 --> 41:07.334
The cold is between me and everything else.

41:07.336 --> 41:09.670
I had a dream about you.

41:09.672 --> 41:11.572
That wasn't a dream.

41:15.510 --> 41:17.978
Maybe there are no such thing as dreams.

41:17.980 --> 41:22.949
Maybe they're all just people like me.

41:22.951 --> 41:26.786
Trying to get back.

41:26.788 --> 41:31.124
Then that thing you
showed me on the bridge...

41:31.126 --> 41:33.793
what was that?

41:33.795 --> 41:37.696
I don't know.

41:37.698 --> 41:41.166
But it's real.

41:41.168 --> 41:44.002
And I think it's been waiting a long time.

41:44.004 --> 41:46.571
Waiting for what?

41:47.010 --> 41:48.352
Miranda: All of us.
