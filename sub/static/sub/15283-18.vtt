00:12.960 --> 00:15.372
South Boston,
MASSACHUSE'I'I'S

00:19.830 --> 00:21.286
-Mr. Hotchner?
-Yes.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.997
-Oh, please. He's been waiting.
-Thank you.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.459
You're the only person he's asked for.
You must be good friends.

00:30.460 --> 00:33.952
Actually, we worked together once,
about 10 years ago.

00:34.710 --> 00:37.110
He'll be lucky if he makes it
through the night.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.533
Anything you do to ease his pain
would be a blessing.

00:57.710 --> 00:59.075
Hi, Tom.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.416
You came.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.570
-Thank you.
-Of course, Tom.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.287
I don't know why you asked for me.

01:06.290 --> 01:07.496
The Reaper.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.208
I shut down the investigation
without an arrest.

01:12.210 --> 01:16.988
The killings stopped,
and I sent you away.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.819
You deserve to know why.

01:20.540 --> 01:21.825
Okay. Tell me.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.911
A deal with the devil.

01:37.540 --> 01:39.610
"If you stop hunting me,
I'll stop hunting them.

01:40.420 --> 01:43.241
For as long as we both shall live.
Till death do us part.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.957
If you agree to my terms,
take out a personal ad

01:45.960 --> 01:47.825
in The Michigan Post."

01:48.210 --> 01:51.168
-This is a contract.
-Which we both honored.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.377
You know we weren't close to catching him.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.951
If it didn't work,
I could have restarted the investigation.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.201
But it did. The killings stopped.

01:59.790 --> 02:03.829
I waited six weeks.
Six weeks before I sent you away.

02:06.380 --> 02:07.916
But, Tom,
how do you know he stopped?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.239
He could have just gone
someplace else.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.411
No. I've kept watch.

02:11.420 --> 02:13.376
I know he stopped.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.707
Sooner or later,
we would have caught a break.

02:18.710 --> 02:22.612
How many people would he have killed
before we caught that break, huh?

02:22.620 --> 02:25.248
Would all those lives be worth it?

02:25.250 --> 02:27.878
We don't get to make those decisions.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.577
We don't let them get away with it.

02:33.540 --> 02:36.282
Then you'll have to pay for my sin.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.746
How do you mean?

02:37.750 --> 02:40.207
The contract's about to expire.

02:42.380 --> 02:46.703
I've felt him watching me. He knows.
He's been waiting for this.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.496
You think
he's going to start killing again?

02:50.380 --> 02:52.701
I did it to save lives.

02:53.330 --> 02:56.618
Please tell the victims' families
that I'm sorry.

02:56.620 --> 03:00.579
Please. Tell them...
Tell them I had no choice.

03:02.460 --> 03:04.576
I'll tell them you're sorry.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.490
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

03:08.500 --> 03:12.413
Yes, that's right, Aaron Hotchner.
Sergeant O'Mara has the number.

03:12.420 --> 03:13.819
Thank you.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.992
-Come in.
-I think I found it.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.537
Michigan Post, March 7, 1998.

03:21.540 --> 03:22.825
Is that right?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.700
Yes.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.746
Because I found it,
do I get to know what it's about?

03:31.960 --> 03:34.997
-The Reaper.
-Like the Boston Reaper?

03:36.290 --> 03:38.918
I didn't even know the BAU
worked on that case.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.879
1998. It was my first case
with the BAU as lead profiler.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.417
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but we don't have a profile

03:45.420 --> 03:47.411
for the Reaper in our system, do we?

03:47.420 --> 03:50.571
That'll be all, Penelope.
You can go home now.

03:50.580 --> 03:53.572
-Okay. Good night, sir.
-Good night.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.615
This morning?

04:42.080 --> 04:45.664
Yes, it is a good thing that
he went quickly in the end.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.531
Well, I appreciate you calling me.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.371
Thank you very much.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.872
RTE 128, MASSACHUSE'ITS

05:03.380 --> 05:04.665
How bad is it?

05:05.250 --> 05:08.492
-We have two flats.
-How did we get two flats?

05:08.500 --> 05:11.492
_-I don't know_.
-All right, I'll call triple A.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.532
What if it was us

05:35.540 --> 05:38.919
-Hey, are you all right?
-Uh, no. I've got two flats.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.377
-I've only got one spare.
-Nina Hale.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.490
Route 128.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.707
Well, you want to try one of mine

05:45.710 --> 05:48.952
Oh, thanks,
but my girlfriend's on with triple A.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.418
Well, I could give you my address.
If it works, you can send me a cheque.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.615
I mean, if you want to stay out
here all night, that's up to you.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.111
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.997
You know what? Sure.

06:00.290 --> 06:03.032
-Let's give it a shot, right?
-You got it.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.822
Our car has two flat tires,
and we don't have a second spare.

06:08.290 --> 06:10.576
Yes. Just past Needham.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.667
-I really appreciate this.
-My pleasure.

06:31.580 --> 06:34.071
Evan

06:37.790 --> 06:40.953
-Give me your watch.
-Please.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.491
-Please don't hurt us.
-This won't hurt.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.070
Please, no.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.451
I'm not going to shoot you.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.878
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

07:06.670 --> 07:10.162
Oh, Nina. I hit my head.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.286
Nina's dead.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.416
Are you scared?

07:19.330 --> 07:20.706
You should be.

08:05.290 --> 08:08.874
_ "Fate is not satisfied
With Infllctlng one calamity."

08:09.420 --> 08:11.160
Roman author, Publilius Syrus.

08:11.170 --> 08:12.706
Goodbye.

08:13.790 --> 08:17.954
You wanted to know immediately
about any unusual Boston homicides?

08:25.670 --> 08:27.410
We're going to Boston.

08:27.420 --> 08:30.162
VVhat

08:30.170 --> 08:32.570
-We haven't been invited, sir.
-We will be.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.378
Well, looks like we're going to Boston.

08:41.290 --> 08:44.612
The Reaper is driven by a need
to dominate, control and manipulate.

08:44.620 --> 08:47.532
So then why would he offer a deal
that would stop him from doing that?

08:47.540 --> 08:48.871
Well, killing gave him power.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.246
But after so many,
the payoff began to diminish.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.787
So he decided to switch tactics.

08:53.790 --> 08:55.530
Offering the deal gave him
the ultimate power.

08:55.540 --> 08:56.871
Better even than killing.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.667
He manipulated the police
into voluntarily surrendering.

08:59.670 --> 09:03.117
-Even got it in writing.
-He won. Why start killing again?

09:03.120 --> 09:04.701
Well, because the only person
that knew he'd won,

09:04.710 --> 09:06.610
the person he made the deal with,
just died.

09:06.620 --> 09:10.374
Narcissistic killers need other people
to recognize their power.

09:10.380 --> 09:13.781
-That's why they contact the media.
-So, how did he stop for 10 years?

09:13.790 --> 09:16.076
In Night of the Reaper,the author suggests

09:16.080 --> 09:19.038
he had been arrested
for an unrelated crime or died.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.372
Perhaps he's trying to correct
that misconception.

09:21.380 --> 09:23.200
What has he been doing all this time?

09:23.210 --> 09:26.168
Planning what he would do
if he started killing again.

09:26.170 --> 09:29.708
So, from '95 to '98, he shoots,
stabs and bludgeons 21 victims.

09:29.710 --> 09:33.168
Men. Women. All ages. All types.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.378
No specific victimology or MO.
How did you build a profile from that?

09:36.380 --> 09:37.529
We didn't.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.532
Shaunessy sent us home
before we had a chance.

09:41.250 --> 09:44.287
BTK, the Zodiac and the Reaper
all have similarities.

09:44.290 --> 09:47.032
They are all highly intelligent,
disciplined, sadistic killers

09:47.040 --> 09:48.667
who named themselves in the press.

09:48.670 --> 09:51.116
Highly intelligent
may be a bit of an understatement.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.577
The Reaper and the Zodiac killer
have never been arrested,

09:53.580 --> 09:56.378
and the BTK killer was only caught
after 25 years

09:56.380 --> 09:59.201
because he went to the press
to counter a book that said he'd died,

09:59.210 --> 10:01.872
moved away, or been locked up.
Just like this one.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.371
Speaking of the media, when this
gets out, it's going to be a frenzy.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.668
If they get wind of this, they're going
to be all over the Boston Police.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.285
The longer we can float
the copycat story,

10:09.290 --> 10:11.076
the better chance
we'll have of catching him.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.957
Rossi, Prentiss and Morgan,
go to the field office,

10:12.960 --> 10:14.746
set up shop,
go through everything there.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.991
JJ and Reid,
we'll go to the crime scene.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.991
I worked the Reaper case
for 18 months.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.070
If there's any proof that this
horrible crime is anything

10:21.080 --> 10:24.789
more than a copycat,
I'll be the first one to let you know.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.669
Sorry I haven't called you back.
As you can see, I'm busy.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.820
It's not a copycat, Mike.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.822
-I wish it were, but it isn't.
-Yeah, no offense, you don't know that.

10:33.830 --> 10:36.742
-And I didn't invite you in.
-Shaunessy did.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.115
Want to invite us in?

10:48.460 --> 10:50.280
What was he thinking?

10:51.080 --> 10:53.992
-This could destroy the department.
-I know.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.576
This is SSA Jennifer Jareau,

10:56.580 --> 10:59.322
Dr. Spencer Reid,
Sergeant Mike O'Mara.

10:59.330 --> 11:01.912
We're setting up at the field office.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.286
Okay. I'm done here.

11:04.290 --> 11:07.282
-Give them anything they want.
-Thank you.

11:07.880 --> 11:11.498
Nina Hale, 19, and Evan Harvey, 23.

11:11.960 --> 11:16.033
Nina's throat was slashed.
She was stabbed 46 times.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.282
Evan was bludgeoned and then shot.
No shell casings were found.

11:19.290 --> 11:21.417
He preferred revolvers. 44 Magnum.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.071
The younger the female victim,
the more time he spends with them.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.377
Usually with a knife.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.668
Tan line on her wrist.
Probably wearing a watch of some sort.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.320
Do we have his wallet?

11:37.250 --> 11:39.662
The Reaper took items from each
victim and placed them on the next

11:39.670 --> 11:41.410
so as to make sure we knew it was him.

11:42.540 --> 11:45.418
-No corrective lens requirement.
-The glasses aren't his?

11:45.420 --> 11:47.741
He only took glasses
from one victim, the ninth.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.286
We should have found them
on the 10th and we didn't.

11:49.290 --> 11:50.917
-They were never found.
-What was so special

11:50.920 --> 11:53.241
-about the ninth victim?
-He surVIved.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.615
George Foyet, 28,

11:54.620 --> 11:57.111
was the ninth victim
and the only one to survwe the Reaper.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.747
Not for lack of trying.

11:58.750 --> 11:59.956
Amanda Bertrand, 19,

11:59.960 --> 12:02.030
his date for the evening,
was not as lucky.

12:02.040 --> 12:06.329
He likes to attack them inside
or near their cars at night

12:06.330 --> 12:08.912
on poorly lit, less populated roads.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.497
Foyet said he approached them
pretending to be a lost tourist.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.287
In the hospital,
we put Foyet with a sketch artist.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.747
The Reaper always uses
some sort of ruse to get close to

12:17.750 --> 12:19.240
and spend time with his victims.

12:19.250 --> 12:23.072
Uh, the eye as he depicts it
appears to be The Eye of Providence,

12:23.080 --> 12:24.911
a symbol adopted by
the US Government

12:24.920 --> 12:27.787
and incorporated
into the Great Seal in 1782

12:27.790 --> 12:30.918
with the words "annuit coeptis"inscribed beneath.

12:30.920 --> 12:35.323
That's Latin for, "Providence or fate
has favored our undertakings."

12:35.330 --> 12:38.743
Reaper seems to see himself
as the personification of fate.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.820
So, how did Foyet survive?

12:42.880 --> 12:45.075
911.
What's your emergency?

12:45.080 --> 12:47.116
I just murdered two more.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.248
Excuse me, sir.
Did you say you murdered someone?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.996
Victims eight and nine.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.743
By a silver Toyota on Riverton,
past the Tyson quarry.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.878
That call was made from a pay phone
about a mile from the crime scene.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.917
EMTs arrived fifteen minutes later.
Bertrand was DOA.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.285
Foyet barely breathing.

13:04.290 --> 13:07.032
So, the Reaper made one of these calls
after each of his killings,

13:07.040 --> 13:08.667
telling the police
where to find the bodies?

13:08.670 --> 13:10.035
Until this one, the ninth.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.827
If he hadn't made this call,
Foyet wouldn't have been found in time.

13:12.830 --> 13:14.115
The call saved him.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.372
So, the Reaper didn't make any
911 calls after this one?

13:17.960 --> 13:20.030
-Yeah?
-Looks like he learned his lesson.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.282
There's a reason he left Foyet's
glasses at the last crime scene.

13:23.290 --> 13:24.496
Foyet could be in danger.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.991
-We'll find him.
-Hotch, there's a reporter outside

13:27.000 --> 13:28.206
insisting on speaking with you.

13:28.210 --> 13:30.451
Roy Colson. He says he knows you.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.319
Roy.

13:35.330 --> 13:39.915
Agent Hotchner. So, if it's just
a copycat, what are you doing here?

13:39.920 --> 13:42.206
Helping the police catch him.

13:42.210 --> 13:44.417
Is that your story?
Come on, I wrote the book on this guy.

13:44.420 --> 13:47.662
I even sent you a signed copy.
I assume you got it.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.537
Officially, we have no reason to think
that he's anything but a copycat.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.201
Well, how about unofficially?

13:54.120 --> 13:58.204
What's more important to you, Roy

13:58.210 --> 14:01.202
I spent time with the families.

14:01.210 --> 14:02.825
I told the victims' stories.

14:02.830 --> 14:06.072
Now, you would know that
if you read my book.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.457
It's a good book, Roy.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.997
You treated the victims with
respect and you treated us fairly.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.570
Every dime it made went to the families.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.821
I know. That's why I came down.

14:15.540 --> 14:18.327
The minute I have something
that I can say, I'll call you.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.205
Thanks.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.827
Well, if it's him, it won't be long.

14:31.420 --> 14:33.035
I don't believe it.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.452
-Unbelievable.
-Honey, please don't.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.530
I'm not speeding. I'm not drunk.

14:51.830 --> 14:52.990
Good evening, Officer.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.958
License, registration
and proof of insurance.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.070
I'll be right back.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.417
He hasn't even told me
why he stopped us.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.991
Let's just get this over with.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.070
I'm going to let you off with a warning.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.820
A warning

15:16.830 --> 15:19.207
You were at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.700
Excuse me?

15:23.830 --> 15:26.162
And now I'm going to kill
your wife, Arthur.

15:30.580 --> 15:34.323
No! No!

15:44.420 --> 15:47.378
Another couple.
Much older this time.

15:47.790 --> 15:49.701
One shot. One stabbed.

15:49.710 --> 15:51.826
No reason to stop out here.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.208
_ _His license _
and registration are out of his wallet.

15:55.210 --> 15:56.871
Looks like he used a cop ruse.

15:56.880 --> 16:00.532
Good spot. Isolated. Few drivers.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.538
-He left Nina Hale's watch.
-Okay. So what'd he take?

16:08.330 --> 16:09.570
His wedding ring.

16:09.580 --> 16:14.608
Arthur and Diane Lanessa
of Weymouth. Married 32 years.

16:15.420 --> 16:19.618
They were coming home from the Elks
where they played bingo twice a week.

16:19.620 --> 16:23.078
-I've got to go make notification.
-You want company?

16:23.500 --> 16:24.910
I got it.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.280
Looks like
he went through her purse.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.207
Any idea what he was looking for?

16:55.330 --> 16:58.037
-The question mark is new.
-It's for us.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.741
He's saying it's not fate.
He's saying we had 10 years

17:01.750 --> 17:04.958
to save them
and that these latest ones are on us.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.076
You got all that from
one question mark.

17:07.080 --> 17:08.786
That's impressive.

17:08.790 --> 17:11.111
-I may know him better than I've let on.
-What does that mean?

17:11.120 --> 17:14.248
It means that there is a profile
on the Reaper.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.036
I thought we were called off
before we had one.

17:16.040 --> 17:19.578
We were. I had just started the profile
and then he stopped killing,

17:19.580 --> 17:22.788
so officially we were done.
But this case...

17:22.790 --> 17:24.200
It stuck with you.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.828
I kept coming back to it over
the years, and I worked on it alone.

17:27.830 --> 17:29.912
So, you never shared it with anyone?

17:29.920 --> 17:32.787
I know I'm always preaching
that profiling is a collaborative effort,

17:32.790 --> 17:34.667
but this one wasn't.

17:34.670 --> 17:37.116
I don't know, maybe if I was wrong,

17:37.120 --> 17:38.917
I was going to head us
in the wrong direction.

17:39.330 --> 17:40.911
But you think you're right?

17:40.920 --> 17:45.072
The more I see,
the more accurate I think it may be.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.286
Okay.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.280
Then we need to hear it.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.787
The Reaper fits a profile
we refer to as an Omnivore.

17:52.790 --> 17:55.668
Unlike most serial killers,
an Omnivore doesn't target

17:55.670 --> 17:57.661
a specific victim type.

17:57.670 --> 18:00.821
Although he tends to focus on his
younger female victims with his knife,

18:00.830 --> 18:03.321
he essentially is a predator
who will kill anyone.

18:03.330 --> 18:05.070
Why is he so democratic?

18:05.080 --> 18:06.877
Because his kills_ _
aren't just about his Victims.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.871
He needs recognition.
He needs us to know.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.031
The symbols, the placement of
prior victims' possessions

18:12.040 --> 18:14.747
on subsequent victims, it's all for us.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.911
-Why?
-Power.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.911
The Shaunessy letter is
the clearest example of this.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.707
He manipulated Tom Shaunessy
into literally surrendering to him.

18:21.710 --> 18:23.075
The burden
was too much to bear.

18:23.080 --> 18:28.165
In a very real sense, Tom Shaunessy
was the Reaper's 22nd victim.

18:28.170 --> 18:32.459
Like BTK killer Dennis Rader,
the Reaper is extremely disciplined.

18:32.460 --> 18:35.167
In his everyday life, this will
very likely make him so inflexible,

18:35.170 --> 18:38.537
he can't keep close relationships
or work closely with others.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.997
I believe our killer has another interest

18:41.000 --> 18:44.458
that may give us the best opportunity
to catch him.

18:44.460 --> 18:46.371
The Reaper's last victim
was an older woman.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.450
He killed her quickly with a single shot.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.576
The prior, younger victim,
he spent more time with

18:50.580 --> 18:53.708
-and stabbed 46 times.
-Why?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.821
He pays special attention to
his younger, female victims.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.570
And his weapon of choice
with them is the knife,

18:58.580 --> 19:01.287
a substitute instrument
for bodily penetration.

19:01.290 --> 19:04.874
And the younger the victim,
the more time and effort he spends.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.498
-I think our guy is a hebophile.
-Hebophile?

19:08.500 --> 19:13.278
Someone who's attracted to adolescent,
post-pubescent children, teenagers.

19:13.290 --> 19:14.996
Look for men with access and authority.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.740
High school teachers,
counselors, coaches,

19:16.750 --> 19:18.536
and anyone who's been charged
with sex crimes

19:18.540 --> 19:21.202
against teenage girls
in the last 10 years.

19:21.210 --> 19:22.666
That's all for now, thank you.

19:24.210 --> 19:27.373
I've got nothing, sir.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.200
What do you mean?
-He's gone.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.952
I mean, he's completely off the grid
and he's gone.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.245
How is that possible?

19:33.250 --> 19:35.206
Nine months after he was
released from the hospital,

19:35.210 --> 19:39.032
he quit his job, sold his car,
closed his bank accounts,

19:39.040 --> 19:42.828
canceled his credit cards,
cell phone, apartment, everything.

19:42.830 --> 19:44.570
He has no paper, thus he has no trail.

19:44.580 --> 19:45.956
And I can't find him because he's gone.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.166
You think it's intentional?

19:47.170 --> 19:50.412
It's more than that, even dead people
stay on the grid for decades.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.912
Take it from me, erasing yourself
like this, it's extremely difficult.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.706
It takes commitment.

19:55.710 --> 19:58.918
Well, you'd have to be willing
to cut every tie of everything

19:58.920 --> 20:01.536
and everyone you've ever
known in your entire life.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.747
It's like killing yourself.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.951
I've got to say, this is impressive.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.167
Well, after what the guy's
been through, can you blame him?

20:08.170 --> 20:10.161
I mean, Foyet's the only
living person who knows

20:10.170 --> 20:12.035
what the Reaper looks like,
and he's still out there.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.201
But it doesn't change
the fact that we still need to find him.

20:14.210 --> 20:15.370
I'll keep looking.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.372
-Garcia, we don't have much time.
-I know, sir.

20:18.380 --> 20:22.032
He would have to completely
isolate himself. He's totally alone.

20:22.040 --> 20:26.158
But how do you cut all ties

20:36.080 --> 20:39.117
-Colson.-Roy, Aaron Hotchner. I need a favor.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.036
How did Colson find this guy?

20:42.040 --> 20:43.951
He interviewed Foyet extensively
for his book.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.279
They kept in touch.

20:45.290 --> 20:46.826
-They're friends?
-Sort of.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.116
But Foyet wouldn't give him
his phone number.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.032
He gave him one of his aliases, though.

20:52.790 --> 20:53.870
That's him.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.569
George Foyet?

21:03.710 --> 21:06.110
It's okay, we're FBI.
This is Agent Rossi.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.281
I'm Agent Hotchner.
We met once before.

21:08.290 --> 21:11.032
-Do you remember?
-Yeah, I remember.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.320
Would you mind
if we get off the street, please?

21:15.330 --> 21:16.536
Yeah, sure.

21:26.330 --> 21:29.288
-How'd you guys find me?
-Roy Colson.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.666
Oh.

21:35.290 --> 21:39.112
Well, is this going to take long?
Because I really can't be late for work.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.576
What do you do?

21:40.580 --> 21:43.879
I'm a freelance computer specialist
for the city.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.202
We're sorry to bother you.
We'll make it as quick as possible.

21:47.210 --> 21:48.700
Are these yours?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.161
I knew it wasn't a copycat.

22:10.290 --> 22:11.746
Thank you.

22:14.460 --> 22:15.825
I'm sorry.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.953
I was going to propose to her that night.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.911
At the restaurant, but I got cold feet.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.570
The ring was still in my pocket
when he approached us.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.615
He said he was lost.

22:31.620 --> 22:32.746
Can I help you?

22:32.750 --> 22:34.661
He had one of those
sightseeing booklets.

22:34.670 --> 22:36.410
I was looking at it
when he stabbed me.

22:36.420 --> 22:39.036
Yeah, perfect...

22:39.420 --> 22:41.911
Mr. Foyet, you don't need
to go through this again.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.070
I couldn't move.

22:45.290 --> 22:49.989
I just sat there, bleeding.
I watched him kill Mandy.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.116
He stabbed her 67 times.

22:55.170 --> 22:58.116
Do you know how long it takes
to stab somebody 67 times?

23:00.500 --> 23:02.491
I never found the ring.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.496
He should have left _ _
your glasses on his next Victim.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.617
But he didn't.
He held onto them all this time.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.378
What, you think he's got some
special interest in me?

23:17.000 --> 23:21.118
I've been living with that possibility
for the past 11 years.

23:21.120 --> 23:25.329
Have you received
any strange letters or calls

23:25.330 --> 23:28.163
I keep residences
under different names.

23:28.620 --> 23:30.827
I move between them randomly.

23:31.210 --> 23:34.031
He likes to get you in a car,
so I take the bus.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.951
Believe me, I've gone through
great lengths to make sure

23:35.960 --> 23:38.702
that none of the things you
just mentioned ever happen.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.959
We'll need your other names
and residences so we can reach you.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.702
We can take you someplace safe
until this is over.

23:48.710 --> 23:50.109
No.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.746
Boston is my home.

23:53.210 --> 23:55.496
It's the one thing I promised
I would never let him take from me.

23:55.500 --> 23:59.573
-Then we'll protect you here.
-You can't protect me.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.496
Nobody can.

24:07.210 --> 24:09.417
Please be careful with this.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.279
Please.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.529
It's safe with us.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.667
He's just a man. Nothing more.

24:22.750 --> 24:24.490
Then why can't you catch him?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.240
We will.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.706
Thank you for your time.

24:34.380 --> 24:37.247
Hey, uh, this was dropped off
at my office.

24:42.460 --> 24:44.496
I'll get this to the lab.

24:45.460 --> 24:46.996
Are you going to run the story, Roy?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.457
Well, you know, if I don't,
he'll just give it to somebody else.

24:49.460 --> 24:51.530
Maybe, maybe not.

24:51.540 --> 24:55.032
To him, you're special.
He wants you to know why he stopped.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.747
-What do you mean?
-You wrote his biography, Roy.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.377
Believe me, over the last 10 years,

24:59.380 --> 25:01.280
he's read those words
thousands of times.

25:01.290 --> 25:03.076
Your book has sustained him.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.116
In his mind, nobody knows him
better than you do.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.031
Nobody cares for him like you.

25:08.790 --> 25:11.827
You remember what it was like
here 10 years ago on the street?

25:11.830 --> 25:13.115
The fear?

25:13.540 --> 25:14.916
And that's when
people trusted the police.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.491
Not this time.
Not if you tell them about Shaunessy.

25:21.460 --> 25:23.701
But it's a hell of a story, run with it.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.417
I mean, do you have any idea
what you're asking me to do?

25:27.420 --> 25:28.614
I'm not asking you to do anything.

25:28.620 --> 25:32.579
This is the biggest story of my life.
And it's mine. It's an exclusive.

25:32.580 --> 25:34.878
I can offer you full and exclusive access

25:34.880 --> 25:38.577
to the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit
after we catch him.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.572
-Right, if I hold the story.
-I didn't say that.

25:41.580 --> 25:44.959
-Full access to the entire unit?
-Nobody's ever had that.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.417
-Well, I know.
-But?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.992
But what if you can't catch him?

25:53.420 --> 25:54.876
Well, that's a risk
you're going to have to take.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.325
Hotchner.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.450
Who is this?

26:15.710 --> 26:18.918
If you stop hunting me,
I'll stop hunting them.

26:20.210 --> 26:23.748
-You think I'd take that?-It's a good deal.

26:27.170 --> 26:31.072
I've misjudged you.
I thought you were smarter than this.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.616
You should take it.

26:32.620 --> 26:37.375
-Then you've misjudged me.-This is your last chance.

26:38.750 --> 26:42.322
I don't make deals.
I'm the guy who hunts guys like you.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.036
There are no guys like me.

26:46.040 --> 26:50.204
-You all think that.-You'll regret this.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.575
I'll see you soon.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.707
Drive.

27:23.460 --> 27:28.079
Make a right at the next light.
I want your jewelry and your wallets.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.206
Pull over right here.

27:36.120 --> 27:39.203
Just take the money.
Nobody needs to get hurt.

27:39.210 --> 27:40.825
Actually, they do.

28:05.580 --> 28:08.208
Six bodies, not including the driver.

28:09.830 --> 28:11.570
He put them down with the gun.

28:11.580 --> 28:15.243
Or more likely, guns,
then finished them off with his knife.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.667
Arthur Lanessa's wedding ring.

28:21.460 --> 28:23.826
-What'd he take

28:32.250 --> 28:34.707
Hey. What's going on with you?

28:38.500 --> 28:41.287
He called me tonight at my hotel
and offered me the deal.

28:41.290 --> 28:43.781
-And what did you say?
-I hung up on him.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.701
And then he does this.

28:47.170 --> 28:49.491
So you think this is your fault?

28:53.710 --> 28:54.950
It is.

28:56.170 --> 28:58.786
Well, here, use mine.
You convinced me.

28:59.170 --> 29:02.412
No, no, you hung up on him.
You practically killed them yourself.

29:02.420 --> 29:03.956
Go ahead, get it over with.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.951
Don't worry about us,
we'll get this guy without you.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.281
Dave, I had 10 years to do
something about it.

29:08.290 --> 29:11.418
Shaunessy made the deal.
The killings stopped.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.991
He closed the case
and sent the BAU away.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.618
For 10 years, you worked on
other cases. Active cases.

29:17.620 --> 29:20.748
But I kept coming back to this one.
I kept coming back to this profile.

29:20.750 --> 29:22.160
Hey, I was retired.

29:22.170 --> 29:24.786
Should I blame myself for
every victim who got killed

29:24.790 --> 29:26.951
while I was on my book tour?

29:27.250 --> 29:30.287
Look, if you want to end up
like Shaunessy, like Gideon,

29:30.290 --> 29:33.453
blaming yourself for
everything, you go ahead.

29:34.250 --> 29:37.913
But that voice in your head,
it's not your conscience, it's your ego.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.825
This isn't about us, Aaron.

29:40.830 --> 29:44.573
It's about the bad guys.
That's why we profile them.

29:44.580 --> 29:48.619
It's their fault.
We're just guys doing a job.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.038
And when we stop doing it,
someone else will.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.241
Trust me. I know.

29:59.290 --> 30:02.703
-You can put that away.
-You're sure?

30:04.080 --> 30:06.378
Yeah, it's a little dramatic,
don't you think?

30:06.380 --> 30:08.780
My wife always said
I had a flair for the dramatic.

30:08.790 --> 30:10.917
-Which one?
-All of them.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.740
-Thanks.
-Any time.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.997
Go ahead and run your story.
It won't matter after this.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.321
I am, but I'm going to leave
the Shaunessy deal out.

30:23.330 --> 30:25.036
I don't think the families need to know.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.746
Not at least until you catch him.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.991
-I appreciate that.
-Foyet called.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.037
-He wants to see me.
-Is he mad that you gave him to us?

30:32.040 --> 30:33.826
I just think he doesn't have
anyone to talk to.

30:33.830 --> 30:37.209
I mean, the Reaper's killing him, too.
Only slower.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.450
He wouldn't be the first.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.200
He never used code before.
Why now?

30:41.210 --> 30:42.996
They're not part of a pattern
or equation.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.491
I mean, mathematically,
they're insigniﬁcant.

30:45.500 --> 30:48.537
Maybe so,
but I know I've seen them before.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.701
Foyet said he likes to attack people
in their cars.

30:50.710 --> 30:52.075
Tonight he hit a bus.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.708
Which is why Foyet only takes the bus.

30:54.710 --> 30:56.780
It was the number seven.

30:59.330 --> 31:01.457
And it stops right in front of
Foyet's apartment.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.667
-He knows where Foyet lives.
-And he wants us to know it.

31:03.670 --> 31:04.659
1439.

31:05.750 --> 31:09.663
The apartment you interviewed him
in today was 1439 Yarbrough.

31:12.790 --> 31:19.070
The other addresses he gave us.
201 South Brookline, 1488 Edenhurst.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.878
The numbers on the bus,
they're Foyet's addresses.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.245
We'll split up and cover each address.

32:00.830 --> 32:02.661
I'll take the back.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.951
There's no one here.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.206
-We've got nothing.
-Same thing here.

32:49.210 --> 32:50.450
Have you heard from Morgan?

33:09.540 --> 33:12.327
Wake up, Derek. It's time to die.

33:26.620 --> 33:30.408
If it's any consolation,
I don't think he knew what hit him.

33:30.880 --> 33:31.995
I'll call JJ.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.072
The Bureau's going to have
to make a statement.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.667
You all right?

33:52.830 --> 33:54.286
He took my credentials.

33:54.290 --> 33:56.918
The important thing is you're okay.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.747
He left me this.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.036
Power and manipulation.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.031
Don't let him get to you.

34:08.670 --> 34:10.160
Yeah, right.

34:12.460 --> 34:14.496
- Come on, man.
-Sorry.

34:16.620 --> 34:20.579
-Prentiss, he's telling me, "I had you."
-Morgan, you're alive.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.112
-You know why?
-It doesn't really matter.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.991
I'm sitting here
because I was knocked out cold.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.879
-He couldn't torture me.
-He likes to interact with his victims.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.747
To tell them he's going
to kill them before he does.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.116
Or by letting them know he could have.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.701
Hotch is right.

34:38.290 --> 34:40.611
He's just trying to get into your head.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.576
Right or wrong, he had me.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.951
O'Mara was clearly killed outside.
This was someone else.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.782
There's signs of a struggle
and a lot of blood.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.031
-But no body?
-Just the drag marks.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.110
The human body holds
5 quarts of blood.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.372
I'd say there's a little more
than half that here.

34:58.380 --> 35:02.111
Whoever the bleeder was,
they lost too much to survive.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.953
Foyet. It was his worst fear,

35:04.960 --> 35:07.702
that the Reaper would come back
and finish the job.

35:07.710 --> 35:10.827
We offered him protection. He refused.
It was his choice.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.490
Why is he so focused
on Foyet?

35:15.500 --> 35:16.910
What's so special about him?

35:16.920 --> 35:19.491
He was his only surviving victim.
The only one he couldn't defeat.

35:19.500 --> 35:22.207
But he's not a threat. Defeating him
would be no great accomplishment.

35:22.210 --> 35:24.246
There's something there
that we're missing.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.616
What about the girlfriend,
Amanda Bertrand?

35:26.620 --> 35:27.746
What do we know about her?

35:27.750 --> 35:31.038
Nineteen, a freshman. She came here
from Michigan to go to school.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.328
Foyet was a teacher's assistant
in one of Amanda's courses.

35:34.330 --> 35:37.959
Michigan. Where the Reaper had
Shaunessy post the personal ad.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.825
That can't be a coincidence.

35:39.830 --> 35:42.492
He told us she was the love of his life.
That he was going to propose.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.242
But she just got here from Michigan,
they only met when the class started.

35:45.250 --> 35:46.740
How long had she been in the class?

35:46.750 --> 35:47.876
Four weeks.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.246
So, it was either love at first sight
or what?

35:50.250 --> 35:51.376
Foyet was lying.

35:51.380 --> 35:54.167
He's a 28-year-old teacher's
assistant in freshman classes.

35:54.170 --> 35:57.037
That gives him plenty of access
to young girls.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.031
-Garcia?
-I'm here.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.110
Uh, what are Foyet's aliases?

36:01.120 --> 36:02.872
I want you to look up
in Boston city records

36:02.880 --> 36:05.531
a Kevin Baskin, Miles Holden,
and William Parker.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.997
Try the Department of Education.

36:08.620 --> 36:11.077
Well played, sir. They all work
for the Department of Education.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.163
They're all substitute teachers.
And they all teach computer science.

36:14.170 --> 36:15.876
-High school?—Yeah.

36:16.620 --> 36:17.996
Oops. Scratch that.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.536
They're not all working
for the Department of Education.

36:19.540 --> 36:21.201
-They're not?-No.

36:21.210 --> 36:23.531
William Parker was fired
for alleged inappropriate behavior

36:23.540 --> 36:25.667
with his female students.

36:25.670 --> 36:29.071
Do you know how long it takes
to stab somebody 67 times?

36:29.790 --> 36:31.109
Hotch?

36:32.750 --> 36:34.911
Why can't you catch him?

36:38.330 --> 36:40.070
Colson went to see Foyet.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.492
Garcia, I need you to locate
Roy Colson's cell phone.

36:42.500 --> 36:46.664
-George Foyet is the Reaper.
-Oh, God! Uh, okay, triangulating now.

36:47.290 --> 36:49.576
I got it, 2633 South Babylon.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.911
It must be an address
that Foyet didn't give us.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.116
-Hey, George.
-Hey.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.451
-Nice to see you.
-Come on in.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.451
-It's been a while.
-You brought your laptop.

37:03.460 --> 37:04.745
-Good.
-Yeah.

37:04.750 --> 37:07.742
-Just set it up over there on the table.
-Okay.

37:07.750 --> 37:11.322
He stabbed Amanda Bertrand to death,
he drove a mile, he called 911,

37:11.330 --> 37:13.491
he went back and he inflicted those
wounds on himself.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.287
He knew EMS would get there
in time to save him.

37:16.290 --> 37:18.167
Between the phone call
and the severity of his wounds,

37:18.170 --> 37:19.785
we never considered him as a suspect.

37:19.790 --> 37:21.030
Why would he do it?

37:21.040 --> 37:23.031
It put him at the core
of the investigation.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.372
Everything we had came from him.

37:25.790 --> 37:27.701
He left his own glasses
at the crime scene.

37:27.710 --> 37:31.453
He pointed us right back in his direction
and still we didn't see it.

37:34.580 --> 37:37.208
So, how are you

37:40.460 --> 37:41.916
Actually, uh...

37:43.420 --> 37:44.739
I'm kind of angry with you.

37:44.750 --> 37:47.662
Because I gave
your name to the FBI?

37:47.670 --> 37:49.114
Is that what this is about?

37:49.120 --> 37:50.246
No.

37:50.880 --> 37:53.701
No, it's not about what you gave them.

37:54.580 --> 37:56.377
It's what I gave you.

37:59.420 --> 38:01.786
Why didn't you break the story
I gave you about the deal

38:01.790 --> 38:02.950
I made with Shaunessy?

38:02.960 --> 38:05.417
-What?
-It was a gift.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.411
I gave it to you.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.667
Wait a minute. Wait. Stop.

38:17.670 --> 38:20.707
-All you had to do was print the story.
-No, this can't... This...

38:20.710 --> 38:22.610
I could have just disappeared again.

38:22.620 --> 38:24.110
This is not you, George.
There's no way this is you.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.576
Please stop! Stop, George!

38:30.540 --> 38:35.204
George, please! This can't be you.
This can't be you. I just don't...

38:35.210 --> 38:36.370
What do you want me to do?

38:36.380 --> 38:39.611
I want you to sit down and get it right.

38:40.210 --> 38:41.279
Okay.

38:47.330 --> 38:50.572
You wrote that I was
either dead or arrested.

38:51.210 --> 38:54.282
Well, now you know
that's not what happened.

38:56.250 --> 39:01.324
I won. I beat them.
And I want everybody to know that.

39:04.790 --> 39:07.167
-It's over.
-Stop.

39:08.620 --> 39:12.283
-I'll kill him.
-You need him to write your story.

39:12.290 --> 39:15.418
I'm taking him with me.
I'll let him go as soon as I'm safe.

39:15.420 --> 39:19.242
No, you're not.
-I said I'll kill him!

39:19.250 --> 39:21.320
You kill him, I kill you.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.820
You think I'm afraid to die?

39:24.830 --> 39:28.459
You're not afraid. _ _
You're greedy and narCI55istic.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.110
You want the recognition
that's going to come

39:31.120 --> 39:32.326
from the book that he's going to write.

39:32.330 --> 39:35.163
You want the fame that's going to come
from the media.

39:35.170 --> 39:39.322
-It's going to be like Bundy.
-I'm going to be bigger than Bundy.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.320
Well, you can't enjoy it if you're dead.

39:45.620 --> 39:48.578
If you know me so well, how come
so many had to die to bring you here?

39:48.580 --> 39:52.072
That's your choice, not mine.
You're the serial killer.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.167
That's right.

39:56.290 --> 39:57.780
Hello, Derek.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.410
Where's my badge?

40:08.920 --> 40:11.377
Where is it, you son of a bitch?

40:12.830 --> 40:16.038
I'm going to be more famous
than you even realize.

40:16.420 --> 40:18.069
Keep dreaming.

40:26.170 --> 40:28.035
-You okay?
-I'm okay.

40:28.540 --> 40:30.496
Yeah, I'm okay. You?

40:37.500 --> 40:39.991
"Men heap together
the mistakes of their lives

40:40.000 --> 40:42.992
and create a monster
they call destiny."

40:43.000 --> 40:44.410
John Hobbes.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.918
They didn't find your credentials
at any of the residences.

40:54.380 --> 40:56.450
The blood at the house was Foyet's.

40:56.460 --> 40:59.952
Reid guessed low.
The coroner said it was 4 quarts.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.825
Hotch, how is that possible?
He'd be dead.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.702
He's been planning his death
for a long time.

41:05.710 --> 41:08.076
So what? He took a little blood
at a time until he had enough

41:08.080 --> 41:11.538
to convince us he was dead
without finding his body?

41:17.460 --> 41:20.111
Morgan, you're going to have
to find a way to let it go.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.451
Could you?

41:23.540 --> 41:24.950
I'd have to.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.490
Foyet escaped.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.117
The guards found him in his cell
vomiting blood and convulsing.

42:31.120 --> 42:32.417
They rushed him to the prison hospital.

42:32.420 --> 42:35.162
-Get me the US. Marshal's office.
-I already called Don Reilly.

42:35.170 --> 42:38.037
I offered our assistance.
He said they'd call us if they needed it.

42:38.040 --> 42:41.248
Boston Field Office just identified
documents from Foyet's house.

42:41.250 --> 42:43.491
They're schematics for
the electrical, heating and water ducts

42:43.500 --> 42:45.161
at East Woburn Correctional Facility.

42:45.170 --> 42:46.956
-He had the schematics?
-And not just for Woburn,

42:46.960 --> 42:49.326
for every jail, prison
and courthouse in Massachusetts.

42:49.330 --> 42:53.494
-And 10 years to plan.
-They're going to find him, right?

42:56.460 --> 42:57.825
No, they're not.

42:59.880 --> 43:03.998
He said he'd be more famous
than we knew. And he was right.
