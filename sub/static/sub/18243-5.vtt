Well,
my dad lost his job

what do you think he wants?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.128
He wants to take

And the last time
we tried to stop him,

could have grabbed it

an environment

07:52.559 --> 07:54.648
where meals
could be shared slowly,

07:54.648 --> 07:56.301
and with loved ones.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.739
The best way to
enjoy our food
is to share it,

07:58.739 --> 08:02.786
family style.
Enjoy.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.875
That's a good idea.
I love to share.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.921

- Sorry.
- It's okay.

- Where are they?
- On the patio.

you can do to help,

I would really
appreciate it.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.585
Well, you know,
I'll call my boss
after lunch,

09:02.585 --> 09:04.979
see what he thinks,
but I can't think of a reason
why he wouldn't hire you.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.850
- Hire him.
- Yeah.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.896
I'm gonna see if I can
get Chuck an internship
at my office.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.246
I don't think that's
a good idea.

09:11.246 --> 09:14.554

nepotism and all.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.425
Nonsense, honey.

It's so nice to meet a kid
with such a good work ethic.

only take a second.

keep you company.

- Hey, Scott.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.143

09:39.143 --> 09:41.581
Darbie, you're with
the wrong dad.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.018
- Come on.
- And you're with
the wrong woman.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.282
What are you doing?

09:48.544 --> 09:49.980
I came by to
check on Buddy,

09:49.980 --> 09:51.591
and your dad
asked me to lunch.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.635
Is that a crime?

09:52.635 --> 09:53.941
Knowing you,
probably.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.333
What do you want?

09:55.333 --> 09:58.032
You haven't
figured that out yet?

09:58.032 --> 09:59.599
You're not as smart
as I thought.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.384
I said stay away
from my family.

10:02.384 --> 10:05.213
Too late, Kelly.
Better get used to
seeing me.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.824
Pretty soon, I'll be
part of the family.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.046
Oh.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.570
Looks like my
maple glazed French toast
has arrived.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.186
I think Chuck's trying to
get my dad fired from his job

10:22.186 --> 10:23.971
just like he did
to Mama P's father.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.190
Maybe,
but what can we do?

10:26.190 --> 10:28.628
Your dad really likes him.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.934
- You have to cook.
- Me?

10:30.934 --> 10:33.197
I have to stay here
and keep an eye on Chuck.

10:33.197 --> 10:36.810
Cooking magic spells
is not a one-woman job.

10:36.810 --> 10:37.941
I can't do it alone.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.290
Maybe you won't have to.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.816
We need something
that will allow Mr. Quinn

10:42.816 --> 10:44.513
to see through
Chuck's lies.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.080
And we don't have
a lot of time.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.995
I know exactly
what you need.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.348
Hannah:
Lemon Lie-m Mints.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.829
Oh, "lie-m,"
as in lie,

10:55.829 --> 10:57.700
as in lie detector test.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.136
Are you sure
this will work?

10:59.136 --> 11:01.138
Whose handwriting
do you think this is?

11:03.358 --> 11:04.794
Oh, you have
excellent cursive.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.361
Thank you.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.319

are what we say,

22:16.160 --> 22:18.206
That's okay.

22:18.206 --> 22:21.731
I think Kelly can probably
handle herself for one day.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.342
I'm with you, dude.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.299
[chuckles]

22:27.346 --> 22:28.303
[bell jingles]

22:29.957 --> 22:31.872
Did you forget something?

22:31.872 --> 22:35.528
I've been thinking about
your offer.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.007
While I don't really
want to work here,

22:37.007 --> 22:39.096
- and I still maintain--
- Oh.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.402
So you didn't get
the job.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.970
I didn't take the job.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.363
As despicable
as you can be,

22:44.363 --> 22:47.191
you've been fair.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.802
I can live with that.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.369
So you want your job back?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.371
- Yes.
- Great.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.850
The dishes
need to be stacked.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.417
Well, hold on.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.549
I have some terms.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.377
You want to negotiate?

23:02.206 --> 23:03.730
A contract?

23:03.730 --> 23:05.166
You think I'm gonna trust
a handshake?

23:05.166 --> 23:07.516
[sighs]
A 20 percent raise.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.779
Okay.

23:09.779 --> 23:13.479
Sharing tips.
Sure.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.524
Permission to sell
your own products.

23:15.524 --> 23:18.005
Fine.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.441
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.444
Yes, yes, yes.
No magic.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.098
Come on,
be reasonable.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.970
You want me
to come back here,
those are my conditions.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.016
We're gonna
bring this place back
the old fashioned way.

23:29.016 --> 23:31.192
No more spells, Mama P.
No magic.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.672
[sighs]

23:47.338 --> 23:49.079
And just to be clear,
we're not friends.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.430
I looked up to you.

23:54.302 --> 23:56.870
I hope I can
make it up to you someday.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.222
So do I.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.445
I guess my dad likes her

24:06.445 --> 24:08.229
even though she
doesn't like camping.

24:08.229 --> 24:11.885
Hey. You know what will
take your mind off of Amy?

24:11.885 --> 24:13.321
Check out what
we found today.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.414
Whoa.
What are these symbols?

24:19.414 --> 24:22.025
Mrs. Quinn:
Girls. Dinner.

24:22.025 --> 24:24.201
Finally, a meal that
doesn't stress me out.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.639
Mom made spaghetti.
Let's get some before
Buddy does.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.510
Ooh, I love spaghetti.
