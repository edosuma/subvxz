WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:11.212
Man on tape:
Low man scraped, yo.
He all the way down.

00:11.312 --> 00:14.048
But we goin' start fresh
on the latest tomorrow,

00:14.148 --> 00:16.050
down from up north...

00:16.149 --> 00:17.818
No problem.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.887
No problem?

00:19.987 --> 00:21.989
Yeah, yo's talkin' about
some guy named Lohman

00:22.090 --> 00:24.492
who is down with strep.
Like he's sick.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.061
And the last part?

00:27.161 --> 00:29.130
And the last part
is something about

00:29.230 --> 00:31.465
how he's gonna start up
a Fashion Lady or some shit.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.833
Fashion Lady?

00:32.933 --> 00:34.268
Hey, I'm fluent
in the Perkins Homes

00:34.368 --> 00:35.703
and Latrobe Tower dialects,

00:35.803 --> 00:38.272
but I haven't quite mastered
the Franklin Terrace.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.274
He's saying they're
sold out in the low-rises,

00:40.374 --> 00:42.610
so tomorrow they're
gonna start fresh with
a new package.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.113
- That's what you hear?
- Listen again.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.115
Low man scraped, yo.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.284
Low man,
meaning the low-rise pit.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.453
He all the way down.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.989
Is down to scraps
on the last package.

00:56.090 --> 00:59.760
But we goin' start fresh
on the latest tomorrow,
down from up north.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.296
Tomorrow, he's gonna start
fresh on the latest package.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.063
Damn, how y'all
hear it so good?

01:04.165 --> 01:06.467
"Gold Coast slave ship
bound for cotton fields,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.536
sold in a market
down in New Orleans."

01:08.636 --> 01:11.105
- The fuck is that?
- Rolling Stones.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.174
First two lines
to "Brown Sugar."

01:13.274 --> 01:15.276
I bet you've heard
that song 500 times,

01:15.376 --> 01:16.710
but you never knew,
right?

01:16.810 --> 01:19.247
I used to put my head
to the stereo speaker

01:19.347 --> 01:21.014
and play that record
over and over.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.284
That explains a lot,
actually.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.122
So, wait on black, yo?

01:28.222 --> 01:30.358
What's white
on black?

01:30.458 --> 01:33.894
Wait on black, right?
Even I heard that shit.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.629
Black's code
for Stinkum.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.098
We picked that up once
we got on his pager.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.201
Now there's gonna
be a re-up of four G-packs

01:40.301 --> 01:42.170
in the low-rise court.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.604
Stinkum is
on the re-up

01:43.704 --> 01:45.273
and it's gonna
go down around noon.

01:45.373 --> 01:48.409
You're sure
about all that?

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.056 --> 02:05.526
Turn it upside down.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.330
Four hash marks
in a row,

02:09.430 --> 02:11.031
one for each G-pack.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.700
"Lo" for low-rises.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.135
Herc:
12 for the time.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.305
"S" for Stinkum.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.209
How long
to figure that out?

02:21.309 --> 02:22.976
Four, five hours.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.812
You sit here looking
at beeper messages

02:24.912 --> 02:26.714
for five hours
at a time?

02:26.814 --> 02:30.518
I don't know, it's kinda fun
figuring shit out.

02:32.886 --> 02:36.890
( theme music playing )

02:38.692 --> 02:41.429
* If you walk
through the garden *

02:43.063 --> 02:46.166
* You better
watch your back *

02:46.267 --> 02:50.504
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

02:50.604 --> 02:52.906
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

02:54.642 --> 02:58.178
* If you walk
through Jesus *

02:58.279 --> 03:01.982
* He'll save your soul

03:02.082 --> 03:06.119
* You gotta
keep the devil *

03:06.220 --> 03:09.089
* Down in the hole

03:09.189 --> 03:12.560
* All the angels sing

03:12.660 --> 03:16.530
* About Jesus' mighty soul

03:16.630 --> 03:20.568
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

03:20.668 --> 03:24.305
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

03:24.405 --> 03:28.041
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

03:28.141 --> 03:32.079
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

03:32.179 --> 03:35.449
* You got to
keep the devil *

03:35.549 --> 03:39.487
* Way down in the hole

03:47.094 --> 03:50.264
* Way down in the hole

03:51.399 --> 03:53.434
* Way down in the hole

03:54.902 --> 03:58.906
* Way down in the hole

03:59.006 --> 04:01.809
* Way down in the hole.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.017
You're not helping me
out here, Sanny.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.251
Major, I--

04:11.352 --> 04:12.986
I ask you for
one fucking thing.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.322
I know, but I don't--

04:14.422 --> 04:15.923
All these months,
I'm carrying you.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.759
I'm sitting here
watching case after case
stack up, right?

04:18.858 --> 04:22.630
These are all yours
and they're all open, Sanny.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.865
Last year,
your clearance
rate was 40%.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.067
This year,
it's less than that.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.503
I caught
some tough ones.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.071
There's not a lot
of dunkers in there.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.874
Oh, Mike, you're good
on the dunkers.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.676
I'll give you that.
Shit, comes to dunkers,

04:35.776 --> 04:38.946
you solve probably six,
seven out of 10.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.448
But a stone
fucking whodunit.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.049
That's not a fair
assessment, Major.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.417
Fair?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.353
What the fuck
is fair?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.321
I got a detective
out there, unsupervised,

04:47.421 --> 04:48.756
running his own
special ops unit,

04:48.856 --> 04:50.991
burning me
every chance he gets.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.093
It's not my job
to fuck another cop.

04:53.193 --> 04:56.864
Oh, not your job.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.933
Tell you what,
Detective.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.803
I'm gonna be so fucking fair,
I'm gonna give you the choice.

05:02.903 --> 05:06.039
Either bring me
something on McNulty,

05:06.139 --> 05:08.376
or go out there
and do your job.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.678
Pick a file,
any file.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.647
- Major, c'mon.
- Pick a murder and solve it.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.950
Or bring me McNulty,
there's no third choice.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.923
( sirens blaring )

05:24.692 --> 05:26.427
Greggs:
Stinkum will have
a runner with him.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.261
The runner's gonna
be holding the package.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.297
When you get 'em,
ride the bumper.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.565
So, he knows
we're there?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.167
Right, lay on the blue
light if you need it.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.669
Now, the runner's
gonna bolt.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.438
I got the runner,
you stay with Stinkum.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.440
- No.
- I got the runner,
he takes Stink?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.842
No. You both
take the runner.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.277
- And Stink gets away?
- Nobody gets away.

05:44.378 --> 05:48.215
But we pull in Stink on a car
stop now, we got to give up PC,

05:48.315 --> 05:50.418
which means we got
to give up the wire.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.785
We didn't set
this whole thing up

05:51.885 --> 05:53.521
for two days worth
of coke vials, did we?

05:53.621 --> 05:55.255
You snatch the runner,
we stick a hook in him,

05:55.355 --> 05:56.924
and go back
to the fishing hole.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.992
And between the wiretap
and the runner bolting
from the truck,

05:59.092 --> 06:01.929
we got a charge on Stinkum
anytime we want it.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.735
We're also edging back
into old murders,

06:07.835 --> 06:09.603
pulling up
fresh witnesses.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.539
And there are assets
to be seized down the road,

06:11.639 --> 06:13.941
- stuff that fronts
for the drug money.
- Like what?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.544
A strip club, a couple
of Westside laundromats,

06:16.644 --> 06:18.579
a AAA rated
towing company,

06:18.679 --> 06:21.649
- a funeral parlor.
- A funeral parlor?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.784
He bought out Tompkin's over
on Gwynn Falls last year.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.586
The money's
going everywhere.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.287
And that's just what we know
from one of Avon's girls

06:27.387 --> 06:28.756
bragging to a friend
of hers.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.157
I mean, Christ knows
what else he's got

06:30.257 --> 06:31.592
that we aren't
even onto yet.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.193
Understand Barksdale's name
is on nothing.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.062
He's always a step
or two removed.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.498
It's a career case,
Your Honor.

06:37.598 --> 06:41.134
Look here, Jimmy.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.604
You misspelled
culpable.

06:43.704 --> 06:47.240
And you're confusing
then and than.

06:47.340 --> 06:52.179
T-H-E-N is an adverb used
to divide and measure time.

06:52.279 --> 06:56.316
Detective McNulty
makes a mess.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.052
And then he has
to clean it up.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.522
Thanks, teach, I mean,
it's great that you're going
through every word.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.592
Not to be confused
with T-H-A-N,

07:04.692 --> 07:06.694
which is most
commonly used

07:06.794 --> 07:08.796
after a comparative
adjective or adverb.

07:08.896 --> 07:13.000
As in, Rhonda is
smarter than Jimmy.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.003
Yeah?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.171
Look, there is more
than enough indication
of progress

07:18.271 --> 07:20.007
to justify
continued intercepts.

07:20.107 --> 07:24.044
I'll sign an order
for 30 more days on
all taps and clones.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.481
One copy to the court,
one to the state's attorney?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.884
Anything else
you need?

07:30.984 --> 07:32.886
What, from you?

07:36.990 --> 07:40.994
I think I'll go
see a man about a dog.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.664
It's always,

07:43.764 --> 07:46.667
always a pleasure,
Ms. Perlman.

07:46.767 --> 07:52.039
Your professional demeanor
and your overall competence

07:52.139 --> 07:56.176
stands in stark
contrast against the usual
municipal backdrop

07:56.276 --> 07:59.246
of mediocrity
and indifference.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.515
- Sarcasm, Judge?
- No.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.383
Another 10 years
of this nonsense

08:03.483 --> 08:05.418
and I see you
wearing the robes

08:05.519 --> 08:08.255
of the district court
for Baltimore City.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.060
That or
a straightjacket.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.268
Oh, Jesus.

08:21.368 --> 08:25.205
I would love to throw
a fuck into her.

08:25.305 --> 08:29.276
Ah, the red hair,
freckles.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.811
( chuckles )
Don't you think, Jimmy?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.580
As in all matters
before the court,

08:32.679 --> 08:35.048
I think whatever
the judge thinks.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.284
C'mon, Jimmy.

08:37.384 --> 08:41.288
Sit. Talk.

08:41.388 --> 08:45.025
( rap music playing )

08:55.202 --> 08:57.571
- 12-14.
- What's up?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.372
Eastbound on Preston.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.941
Stinkum and a young boy
riding shotgun.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.877
They're at the light
right now.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.892
Got 'em.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.010
See how he plays it.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.979
( siren blares )

09:41.314 --> 09:42.983
Fucking shit.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.020
( sirens blaring )

09:51.925 --> 09:54.294
He's gonna bail
any moment.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.099
Woman:
Jump out, jump out.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.201
Bail out on Druid Hill,
700 block.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.772
Suspect wearing grey sweats,
running into the court.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.707
Fuck me.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.943
( people shouting )

10:12.880 --> 10:15.649
Step, shorty.
Step, step.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.885
He ain't man
enough for you.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.854
Hello, Officer.

10:22.522 --> 10:26.626
Move, motherfucker.
White man walkin'.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.862
Yo, move, shorty
that's the re-up, yo.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.200
- Goddamn.
- He's coming back.

10:33.300 --> 10:38.005
- Give it up, son.
- Cut him off, cut him off.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.306
Yo, get him.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.675
I got the bag.
I got the bag.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.877
He's going right.
He's going right.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.512
Get the bag.
Get the bag.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.514
Yo, move, man.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.683
What's up, what's up,
what's up?

10:49.783 --> 10:52.352
Damn, motherfucker.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.890
Bet you don't do that
shit to a white man.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.026
All y'all get the fuck
away from him.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.161
That man ain't
bothering nobody.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.963
Four packs.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.732
Street-ready.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.000
Carver:
12-08.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.271
Need a wagon inside
the 800 block of Lex.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.973
Inside the court.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.175
Dispatcher:
10-4, 12-08.

11:16.643 --> 11:19.179
Anyone got a smoke?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.915
( laughing )

11:26.353 --> 11:28.388
How are you sitting
with your bosses?

11:28.488 --> 11:30.824
Rawls tried to close
this thing down last week.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.693
Blow the wiretap by charging
some weak-sister murders.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.396
- What stopped him?
- Daniels.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.932
- Daniels?
- I couldn't believe
it either.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.269
I'm ready to throw
in the fucking towel.
Daniels stepped up.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.904
Yeah?

11:44.004 --> 11:46.206
Why didn't
you come to me?

11:48.108 --> 11:49.977
You don't trust me
no more, Jimmy?

11:50.077 --> 11:53.113
Who dropped a dime
to that newspaper
reporter, Your Honor?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.882
Where you been?

11:54.982 --> 11:56.716
35 cents these days,

11:56.817 --> 11:59.119
before anybody'll
cough up a dial tone.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.155
No, it's 50.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.323
I got another week

12:03.423 --> 12:05.225
before my homicide shift
flips to night work.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.694
I'm not back with 'em,
Rawls sticks it to me.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.497
Well, you got
a friend here.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.801
Worse comes to worse,

12:13.901 --> 12:16.036
Pearlman goes
to her bosses.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.737
The state's
attorney's office

12:17.838 --> 12:19.172
still has some love
for you, Jimmy.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.041
All due respect,
I'm starting to worry

12:21.141 --> 12:22.542
more about the people
who claim to love me

12:22.642 --> 12:24.912
than the ones
that don't.

12:25.012 --> 12:28.148
( rap music playing )

13:02.215 --> 13:03.350
Now?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.785
Yeah, yeah.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.988
Somebody's hitting
Stringer Bell's pager

13:08.088 --> 13:09.857
from the number two
payphone in the tower court.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.192
- Now?
- Now.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.176
What's up?

13:58.005 --> 14:00.140
- Freamon.
- Visual on Stinkum.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.876
Stinkum:
Yo, we lost four
to Five-O.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.945
- What?
- We lost four.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.047
Yo, why the fuck
are you tellin' me this?

14:07.147 --> 14:09.449
I'll talk
to you later.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.030
( rap music playing )

14:33.941 --> 14:36.543
Does he think I can
just pull it out of my ass?

14:37.877 --> 14:40.480
( laughs )

14:40.580 --> 14:43.850
Can't go outside
and play till your
homework's done, huh?

14:43.951 --> 14:46.253
Can't do shit till I clear
this case for Rawls.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.923
- How old is it?
- Old and cold.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.625
Yours to begin with?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.427
( laughs )

14:54.527 --> 14:58.398
Well, then, my friend,
you are double-fucked.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.938
Motherfucker.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.641
Son of a bitch!

15:10.510 --> 15:12.345
Give me the card.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.651
You sick,
heartless bastard.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.021
C'mon, c'mon,
give me the card.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.995
Jay?

15:28.095 --> 15:30.897
* She was
a gypsy woman *

15:30.998 --> 15:34.401
* She was a gypsy woman.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.446
Madame Laurie?

15:46.546 --> 15:49.016
You scoff?

15:50.117 --> 15:53.153
Madame fucking
LaRue, Jay?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.622
Better men than you have
turned to this lucky lady

15:55.722 --> 15:57.724
in their dark night
of dead ends.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.394
You're not serious.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.764
I don't joke when
it comes to Madame LaRue.

16:04.864 --> 16:08.068
The woman, she has
an unexplainable gift

16:08.168 --> 16:10.203
in matters of
death investigation.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.739
She transcends
the rational.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.746
Give her a call.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.295
He's dropped here.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.497
So, the dumpsters
cover it from this side,

16:37.597 --> 16:41.468
but everyone over there
with a window had a view.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.247
Merit badge for
two good little scouts.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.217
Ma'am.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.453
You need some help
with that?

17:01.921 --> 17:03.256
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.558
Please,
it's our pleasure.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.103
Let me understand.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.970
Y'all hang
around the projects,

17:18.070 --> 17:19.705
white and black
together,

17:19.806 --> 17:21.273
ties and jackets on,

17:21.374 --> 17:23.810
lookin' to help ladies
with their shopping carts

17:23.910 --> 17:26.113
and whatever else?

17:26.213 --> 17:27.946
Police, right?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.416
Afraid so, ma'am.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.951
About the murder
awhile back, right?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.821
Maintenance man?

17:44.564 --> 17:47.667
The defendants
can take a seat.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.703
The judge will
be in shortly.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.774
- Here.
- Thank you.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.845
Excuse me,
ma'am?

18:14.494 --> 18:15.862
Hey.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.130
Detective.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.765
I need
to pull one out.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.433
Yeah, which one?

18:26.506 --> 18:27.974
Let's see.

18:28.074 --> 18:31.144
Dope, coke, dope,
theft, dope,

18:31.244 --> 18:33.213
loitering, coke,
attempted theft, dope,

18:33.313 --> 18:37.217
dope, theft, dope
and the charge du jour is...

18:37.317 --> 18:40.453
possession,
to wit, cocaine.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.922
- But you need him?
- I need him.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.258
Okay, he bounces
over to drug court,

18:45.358 --> 18:47.694
pleads to possession
and agrees to probation

18:47.794 --> 18:49.162
with ongoing treatment.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.798
- That's it?
- That's it.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.800
Okay.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.905
I'm with
your boy Bubs.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.507
You want out, right?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.841
Yeah.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.376
Plead guilty
to possession

19:03.476 --> 19:04.877
and convince
the drug court judge

19:04.977 --> 19:06.213
you wanna
get your shit clean.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.714
Drug court?

19:07.814 --> 19:10.116
Shake it off in treatment,
go to some meetings

19:10.217 --> 19:11.718
and pee when they
tell you to pee.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.853
- No jail?
- No jail.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.188
I'm out right now?

19:15.288 --> 19:17.490
Soon as
you're processed.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.296
Okay.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.707
Dead man was
coming this way

19:34.807 --> 19:37.244
and another man was
walking behind him.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.246
Must've said
something to him,

19:39.346 --> 19:42.215
'cause he turned around
before he got shot.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.616
Do you know
the man who did it?

19:43.716 --> 19:45.017
No, sir, uh-uh.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.586
- What'd he look like?
- Who?

19:46.686 --> 19:50.257
- The bad guy.
- Light-skin, medium height.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.360
Didn't have
no meat on him.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.396
- Young or old?
- He wasn't young.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.866
Okay, if you pretend
my partner here is the victim

19:59.966 --> 20:01.801
and I'm the guy
with the gun.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.505
This close?

20:05.605 --> 20:07.440
No.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.712
Uh-uh.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.584
Like that?

20:17.684 --> 20:20.653
Yeah,
that's about right.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.991
Do you think
if you saw this guy again--

20:25.091 --> 20:26.393
I...

20:26.493 --> 20:27.894
Ma'am, please,
don't be afraid.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.863
From where I was sitting,
his back was to me.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.668
It's alright,
you done good.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.004
You have any trouble
at all, you call us.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.812
( door closes )

20:49.148 --> 20:50.750
She can't
make a positive ID.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.319
My man Omar can.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.153
A stickup artist with
a half-dozen priors.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.555
That's your
eyeball witness?

20:55.655 --> 20:56.989
She corroborates him
on most of the details,

20:57.089 --> 20:59.225
right down
to the close range shot.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.961
Plus, we've got Omar
saying if we jack Bird,
we'll get the gun.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.563
Says he's too stupid
to throw it off.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.231
So, between
her and Omar,

21:05.332 --> 21:07.900
a match on the gun
gets us over.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.438
It happened
like you said.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.340
Like it was a plan.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.975
It was a plan.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.618
What's your address?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.920
734 Fayette.

21:28.020 --> 21:31.558
734 Fayette.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.060
What's the apartment?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.664
Hey, kid,
what apartment?

21:37.764 --> 21:41.133
C'mon, kid,
what's the apartment?

21:41.233 --> 21:42.502
11-M.

21:42.602 --> 21:46.706
Okay, 11-M,
was that so hard?

21:46.806 --> 21:49.008
What's your DOB?

21:49.108 --> 21:50.743
C'mon, kid.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.914
- Uh...
- What?

21:55.014 --> 21:57.049
It's him.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.486
Who?

22:22.742 --> 22:25.011
Kevin Johnson?

22:26.779 --> 22:30.383
You hungry?
Ham and cheese, tuna?

22:30.483 --> 22:32.151
I want
a Reesie's, yo.

22:32.251 --> 22:35.788
Peanut butter cup.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.023
Drink?

22:37.123 --> 22:38.891
Tea in a can.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.394
You got it.

22:44.163 --> 22:45.865
Go down
to the machines.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.935
Get a peanut butter cup
and a can of Lipton's Tea.

23:00.713 --> 23:04.350
Motherfucker can't
even look at me.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.152
What say we start
over on this?

23:06.252 --> 23:07.687
Start over?

23:07.787 --> 23:09.756
My lawyer said I got a case
against y'all for this shit.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.390
Fuck the lawyers.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.760
I'm tryin' to talk
about life here, Kevin.

23:15.294 --> 23:18.230
Game already
cost you, right?

23:18.330 --> 23:20.166
More than it should have,
I know.

23:20.266 --> 23:21.901
Whose fault is that?

23:23.269 --> 23:26.706
His. Ours.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.608
Mine, maybe.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.978
Thing is, I feel like
I owe you something here.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.280
So, I'm asking how
you want to carry this?

23:34.380 --> 23:36.549
You want
to get out?

23:36.649 --> 23:39.752
You wanna do something else
with the rest of your years,

23:39.852 --> 23:42.054
you come see me.

23:45.357 --> 23:48.094
Tea was sold out.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.966
Might be tomorrow,
might not be for a while.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.602
But when you think you ready
for something different,

23:55.702 --> 23:57.069
you give me
a call.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.805
I'll remember.

24:00.239 --> 24:04.210
Motherfucker thinkin' he can
pimp me over a candy bar.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.220
Mike:
I'm thinking it might
be a drug thing.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.188
Or maybe
straight-up robbery.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.859
You're Irish, no?

24:19.959 --> 24:21.427
Italian.

24:21.528 --> 24:22.829
Santangelo.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.931
Santangelo.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.766
Saint Angelo.

24:26.866 --> 24:30.236
Early martyr,
patron saint of
Licata, Italy.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.939
Prayed for his killer with
the knife still in him.

24:33.039 --> 24:36.375
But it's not
Saint Angelo calling.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.612
It's Saint Anthony
who wants to help you.

24:39.712 --> 24:44.584
- He does?
- Very much.

24:44.684 --> 24:47.920
Ain't he the guy you call
when you lose something?

25:04.370 --> 25:06.573
You sure that's Anthony?

25:06.673 --> 25:09.909
Go to the victim's grave,
bury the statue.

25:10.009 --> 25:13.479
Wait an hour,
a full hour, no shortcuts.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.147
Then dig it up.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.616
Go straight home.

25:16.716 --> 25:20.787
When you go to bed,
hold it to your ear.

25:20.887 --> 25:23.756
And he tells me
who did it?

25:27.960 --> 25:31.097
* And you're the reason
our kids are ugly *

25:31.197 --> 25:33.600
* Little darlin'...

25:33.700 --> 25:35.835
I think it was
my turn to pick.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.169
Uh-uh.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.437
Yeah,
definitely my turn.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.539
You had me down at
the B&O the other night.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.874
Night after,
you dragged me

25:41.974 --> 25:44.276
to the Sugar Hill
Tavern, remember?

25:44.376 --> 25:45.912
Naw.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.814
Hey, Turk.

25:51.618 --> 25:54.286
Hey, ah.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.259
Where's Nadine
this fine evening?

26:01.327 --> 26:02.762
Gainesville.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.998
Been down in Florida
at her sister's all
damn week.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.704
Shame to say, though,
lack of pussy will change

26:11.804 --> 26:14.540
even a good man's
demeanor.

26:14.641 --> 26:17.777
( mumbling )

26:35.161 --> 26:36.495
- Marla.
- Karen.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.730
Good to see you.

26:37.830 --> 26:38.931
You remember
my husband, Cedric.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.133
Yes, I do,
nice to see you.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.969
Marla's with me

26:43.069 --> 26:45.371
on the GBC's downtown
redevelopment committee.

26:45.471 --> 26:47.974
She's the one that prods me
awake at the meetings.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.909
Oh, that was
drastic stuff.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.443
Everybody was
nodding off.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.379
That last one
was so long.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.047
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.732
$500-a-plate fundraisers
for a police lieutenant.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.667
Even in this city

27:14.767 --> 27:18.204
that constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment.

27:18.304 --> 27:22.008
And which member
of the ticket has
so energized you?

27:22.108 --> 27:23.776
The mayor?

27:23.876 --> 27:25.845
Council president?

27:25.945 --> 27:28.114
The Register
of Wills, maybe?

27:28.214 --> 27:31.050
Well, the mayor, I might
recognize if I saw him.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.419
For the rest, I'd pretty
much need "B" of "I" photos.

27:33.519 --> 27:34.987
You're not wrong,
Lieutenant.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.122
In this state,

27:36.222 --> 27:39.425
it's a thin line
between campaign posters

27:39.525 --> 27:42.028
and photo arrays.

27:44.630 --> 27:47.266
( laughing )

27:50.069 --> 27:52.304
Pop quiz.

27:53.706 --> 27:57.276
Oh, city council?

27:57.376 --> 27:58.577
Eastside, maybe?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.579
State senator.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.548
Clay Davis from
the 39th District.

28:02.648 --> 28:05.684
Vice-chair on
the budget committee.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.354
You'll never make major
at this rate.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.658
( laughs )

28:12.759 --> 28:15.127
Excuse me, while I do
my duty and...

28:15.227 --> 28:18.931
kiss some
senatorial haunches.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.370
Clay, nice
to see you again.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.443
C'mon, let's roll.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.957
Ain't you gonna
sign it?

28:45.057 --> 28:47.693
No, you get that back
when the meeting's over.

28:47.794 --> 28:50.262
And if you don't stay,
we don't sign.

28:50.362 --> 28:53.032
That's how it works.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.774
C'mon, I wanna
see the show.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.044
Hey, Bubs.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.186
C'mon.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.460
I ain't seen some of
these faces in so long,

29:21.560 --> 29:23.395
thought they
were dead.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.564
Same thing,
ain't it?

29:25.664 --> 29:28.434
Having had a spiritual awakening
as the result of these steps,

29:28.534 --> 29:30.903
we tried to carry
this message to other addicts

29:31.003 --> 29:34.173
and practice these principles
in all our affairs.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.575
Today's speaker
is gonna be Walon,

29:36.675 --> 29:39.946
who, if you come
to these meetings,
you have to know.

29:46.018 --> 29:49.188
Well, hell, y'all know that
I'm Walon and I'm an addict.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.356
All:
Hey Walon.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.125
And the fact is that
I want to be clean today

29:53.225 --> 29:54.660
more than I want
to be high.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.528
I know that's right.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.031
It's good to be here.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.134
Hell, it's good
to be anywhere clean.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.571
Even Bawlmer.

30:05.671 --> 30:08.174
I been clean a few
24 hours now,

30:08.274 --> 30:11.310
and I'm still dead certain
that my disease wants me dead.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.846
Yeah, I'm in here
with y'all talkin' shit

30:13.946 --> 30:16.315
about how strong I am,
how strong I feel,

30:16.415 --> 30:18.450
but my disease is out there
in that parkin' lot

30:18.550 --> 30:21.387
doing push-ups on steroids,
waiting for the chance

30:21.487 --> 30:24.023
to kick my ass up and down
the street again.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.824
Woman:
Hear ya, hear ya.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.227
Scars on my hands,
on my feet.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.230
Two 'bouts of
endocarditis.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.400
Hep-C and whatnot
knockin' down walls

30:34.500 --> 30:37.636
and kickin' out windows
in my liver.

30:37.736 --> 30:40.739
I lost a good wife,

30:40.839 --> 30:44.243
a bad girlfriend,
and the respect of anyone

30:44.343 --> 30:47.146
that ever tried to loan me
money or do me a favor.

30:48.114 --> 30:51.750
Pawned my pickup,
my bike,

30:51.850 --> 30:54.353
my National
steel guitar

30:54.453 --> 30:57.789
and a stamp collection
that my granddad left me.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.692
And when it was
almost over for me,

31:00.792 --> 31:02.594
and I was out there
on them corners,

31:02.694 --> 31:06.065
not a pot to piss in and anyone
that ever knew me or loved me

31:06.165 --> 31:09.135
cussin' my name, you know
what I told myself?

31:09.235 --> 31:12.638
I said, "Walon,
you're doing good."

31:12.738 --> 31:14.473
( laughing )

31:14.573 --> 31:16.108
I surely did.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.010
I thought I was
God's own drug addict.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.711
And if God hadn't
meant for me to get high,

31:19.811 --> 31:23.249
he wouldn't have made bein'
high so much like perfect.

31:23.349 --> 31:27.186
Now, I know I got
one more high left in me,

31:27.286 --> 31:31.090
but I doubt very seriously
if I have one more recovery.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.858
So if there's
anybody out there

31:32.959 --> 31:35.561
that sees that bottom
comin' up at 'em,

31:35.661 --> 31:37.997
I'm here to talk sense.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.732
I don't care
who you are,

31:40.832 --> 31:42.668
what you done,

31:42.768 --> 31:44.570
or who you done it to.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.439
If you're here,
so am I.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.575
That's right.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.683
The Mustard Seed Group
gives out keychains

31:57.783 --> 31:59.218
for stretches of
clean time.

31:59.318 --> 32:02.288
So if you've earned it,
come on up and get it.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.324
Does anybody
have nine months?

32:07.893 --> 32:10.929
Does anyone
have six months?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.900
Does anyone
have three months?

32:15.001 --> 32:16.335
Yeah.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.111
Does anybody
have one month?

32:33.819 --> 32:36.222
And now, for the most
important person in this room.

32:36.322 --> 32:40.859
Does anybody have 24 hours
or a sincere desire to live?

32:40.959 --> 32:42.761
Yeah, all right.

32:42.861 --> 32:45.164
( cheering, applause )

33:08.987 --> 33:11.023
Yo, we shoved off
this morning.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.159
All:
God grant me
the serenity

33:13.259 --> 33:15.527
to accept the things
I cannot change

33:15.627 --> 33:17.563
and the courage
to change the things I can

33:17.663 --> 33:20.266
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

33:21.567 --> 33:25.337
( TV playing )

33:27.573 --> 33:29.308
What's the score?

33:29.408 --> 33:30.909
Orioles,
four to three.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.544
Bernie Williams just
doubled though.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.514
They always let the Yankees
back into it, always.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.450
No, they got
a bullpen this year.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.386
Who's pitching?

33:40.486 --> 33:42.454
Buddy Groom.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.723
Who you drivin' for?

33:44.823 --> 33:47.193
Marla Daniels.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.030
Unh, unh, unh, I love
to crack this here crib.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.733
- Unh.
- Yeah?

33:54.833 --> 33:57.903
Good day's work.
Good day's work.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.471
What about
the alarm system?

33:59.571 --> 34:02.308
Shit, I'd wire that weakass
thing back on itself,

34:02.408 --> 34:06.178
pull the truck up,
bust through those
French doors.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.647
- That'd work.
- Yes, indeed.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.616
Sell most of this good
shit around the way,

34:10.716 --> 34:12.551
but some of it,
like the art and all,

34:12.650 --> 34:14.753
I might have
to run it up New York.

34:14.853 --> 34:16.788
Name's Damien Price.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.590
But I mostly
go by Day-Day.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.592
Cedric Daniels.

34:21.927 --> 34:24.330
But I mostly
go by Lieutenant.

34:26.931 --> 34:29.501
Look, they're
bringing in Roberts.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.004
There you are.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.806
There's somebody
I need you to meet.

34:44.014 --> 34:46.452
( cheering, shouting )

34:48.853 --> 34:50.188
- Go on.
- Yeah.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.456
Take it all off.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.425
Rub 'em together
like that.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.328
See here,
motherfucker.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.697
You got to put
this Gant thing on Bird,

34:58.797 --> 35:00.866
and then you got
to do something with
that other case,

35:00.966 --> 35:02.134
the young girl.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.303
Diedre Kresson.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.538
You need to get
to a place where you can
charge both them murders

35:06.638 --> 35:08.540
and then you walk
that on up to Rawls.

35:08.640 --> 35:12.344
Now, you see, Jimmy,
here's the hard part

35:12.444 --> 35:14.280
for an asshole
like yourself,

35:14.380 --> 35:16.047
you just got
to give him them

35:16.148 --> 35:18.284
clearances like
a goddamn gift.

35:18.384 --> 35:21.320
And then you still
might have to kiss
his ass for about

35:21.420 --> 35:23.922
three, four
motherfucking months.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.824
You gonna
have to do it.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.826
Three or
four months, huh?

35:30.262 --> 35:31.663
Got to, Jimmy.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.965
Too fuckin' late
to do anything else.

35:34.065 --> 35:38.036
You gonna be one
ass kissin' white man.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.506
You know why I respect
you so much, Bunk?

35:40.606 --> 35:42.241
Uh-uh.

35:42.341 --> 35:45.477
It's not 'cause
you're a good police.

35:45.577 --> 35:48.214
'Cause, you know,
fuck that, right?

35:48.314 --> 35:50.182
Fuck that, yeah.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.717
It's not cause
when I came to homicide

35:51.817 --> 35:54.886
you taught me all kinds
cool shit about...

35:54.986 --> 35:57.155
well, I don't know,
whatever.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.291
Whatever.

35:59.391 --> 36:03.662
It's 'cause when it came
time for you to fuck me,

36:05.464 --> 36:07.866
you were very gentle.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.336
You're damn right.

36:10.436 --> 36:13.639
See, 'cause you could've
hauled me out of the garage

36:13.739 --> 36:17.276
and just bent me over
the hood of a radio car.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.779
But no, you were--

36:20.879 --> 36:22.814
you were very gentle.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.386
I knew it was
your first time.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.021
I wanted to make
that shit special.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.224
It was, man.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.893
It fucking was.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.701
Take your fucking
money back.

36:42.801 --> 36:43.969
No, no, this is mine.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.871
Take it back,
you old whore.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.639
Turk.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.875
Can I get one more?

37:02.954 --> 37:04.523
- What's up, O?
- Hey.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.192
- They up there, right?
- Yeah, they up there.

37:07.293 --> 37:10.028
Hey, Dee.

37:10.128 --> 37:12.698
You get a chance, man, let me
pull your coat to something.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.900
I got a little move
we might could do.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.702
So, get with me
after, okay?

37:16.802 --> 37:20.138
A'ight, mos def.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.042
Yo, the only reason
why I even called Bell
was because these niggas--

37:24.142 --> 37:27.313
You're not supposed
to talk shit on the phone
and you know that.

37:27.413 --> 37:28.947
( knocking )

37:33.952 --> 37:36.288
what's up, bro?

37:37.723 --> 37:39.391
Who snitchin'?

37:40.892 --> 37:43.562
- Nobody.
- Is you sure on that, man?

37:43.662 --> 37:46.532
You done had the stickup,
then the jumpout.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.967
- Now they runnin' up on Stink.
- My crew, we tight.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.502
A'ight?

37:50.602 --> 37:52.237
Now, ain't nobody
holdin' no extra money.

37:52.338 --> 37:53.505
I already
checked all that.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.173
So, maybe your ass
just ran a stop

37:55.273 --> 37:56.642
or had a taillight out
or some shit like--

37:56.742 --> 37:58.677
Nigga, you think
I'd run a stop with 4,000?

37:58.777 --> 38:00.846
- Fuck no.
- Nigga, I don't know.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.048
Well, something is up.

38:03.148 --> 38:05.016
So, go down
there today

38:05.116 --> 38:07.353
and tell them hoppers you got
workin' for you down there

38:07.453 --> 38:09.154
that this shit is
about to change.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.222
Stringer gonna
come down there,

38:11.323 --> 38:12.891
he gonna run
through the changes.

38:12.991 --> 38:16.362
Until this shit is straight,
the pit is dead.

38:25.771 --> 38:29.675
Thing is, why they
didn't pop Stink?

38:29.775 --> 38:32.344
Knockos took the boy
and the package,

38:32.444 --> 38:35.180
and they got Stink
by the tags on the truck.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.849
You took that down to the police
and filed a report, right?

38:37.949 --> 38:41.887
Truck, I ditched that shit
up off Coldspring Lane, man.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.956
You ain't heard nothin'
from the knockos yet, right?

38:45.056 --> 38:46.658
No.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.761
What the fuck?

38:49.861 --> 38:53.665
They catch four packs
poppin' out the truck.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.402
They don't even
get the plate?

38:58.203 --> 39:00.105
What's all this shit?

39:00.205 --> 39:02.541
Bell:
Something's up, man.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.943
Something is
definitely up.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.582
I got somewhere
I gotta be.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.552
Cover me with Daniels,
will ya?

39:16.922 --> 39:18.824
Asshole.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.027
Herc, Carver.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.030
- What?
- What?

39:25.130 --> 39:27.065
Come here.
Come here.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.044
Poot:
Them two is freaks, yo.

39:39.144 --> 39:42.648
Stash-findin'
motherfuckers popped
the package from nowhere.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.750
Cassandra:
Who you talkin'?

39:44.850 --> 39:47.519
Poot:
Skinny black motherfucker
and that ass-ugly knocko.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.387
The white boy
with the ball cap.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.656
Cassandra:
The ones who jumped Bodie?

39:50.756 --> 39:53.024
Poot:
Batman and Robin, yo.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.461
A'ight.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.766
- Bam.
- You got 'em baby.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.701
- I'm Batman.
- I don't think so.

40:02.801 --> 40:05.937
- Batman's white.
- And Robin's black?

40:08.940 --> 40:10.842
Batman!

40:10.942 --> 40:15.313
You heard the hopper,
you're the ass-ugly
white guy.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.916
Boy Wonder, why don't
you suck my bat-dick?

40:18.016 --> 40:19.951
Get the fuck
outta here.

40:24.623 --> 40:28.026
Why don't you sign
this for me there,
Mr. One-day man.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.867
God have mercy when
they piss you, boy.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.837
You mean the God
of my understanding?

40:38.937 --> 40:42.808
No, no, no, we gotta get you
some clean piss, you know,

40:42.908 --> 40:45.176
so you can take up
into your probation office.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.578
Yo, Bubs.

40:46.678 --> 40:49.080
Who the fuck we know
with clean piss?

40:59.424 --> 41:01.292
So, you're ready
to charge this one?

41:01.392 --> 41:03.128
If we luck
into the gun, yeah.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.096
And then
we tag-team Bird.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.232
If we get him with the gun,
we take it federal.

41:07.332 --> 41:11.236
Five years minimum,
and he's got prior felonies,
it's a lot more.

41:11.336 --> 41:13.071
We got an address
we want to hit?

41:14.573 --> 41:15.941
We're working
with informants.

41:16.041 --> 41:20.045
As soon as we get
something, we jump.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.313
Man on radio:
...into the warm air
for the afternoon,

41:22.413 --> 41:24.750
partly sunny, windy and warm
with a chance of thunderstorms,

41:24.850 --> 41:27.619
high up to 83
and then on Friday,

41:27.719 --> 41:29.220
clearing and windy
with a high near 70.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.758
Weather updated around
the clock on WTOP radio.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.727
I'm meteorologist Dave Lew
at the Weather Channel.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.997
This is the WTOP
Radio Network.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.201
Greggs:
You worried
about being seen?

41:43.301 --> 41:45.503
Well, if anybody
got a problem

41:45.604 --> 41:47.172
with me spendin' time
with y'all,

41:47.272 --> 41:51.042
I be much obliged to stick
my gun straight in they mouth.

41:51.142 --> 41:52.878
How that work?

41:57.048 --> 41:59.585
Omar:
Bird not up
in the mix today.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.486
Well, if you had more
than a street name,

42:01.587 --> 42:03.321
maybe we could come up
with an address.

42:03.421 --> 42:05.390
What can I say?

42:05.490 --> 42:07.258
Out here, Bird just Bird.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.461
So what up?
Y'all fixin' snatch him
from out here, or what?

42:10.562 --> 42:11.897
That's the plan.

42:11.997 --> 42:13.765
He don't pack down here,
none of 'em do.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.768
And that's the rule.
Now, if you want iron,

42:16.868 --> 42:18.737
you gotta go to one of
those kids up in the towers.

42:18.837 --> 42:20.906
- But we need the gun.
- Then y'all gotta problem.

42:21.006 --> 42:23.775
Without knowing his crib,
we definitely got a problem.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.911
Not unless y'all know
where Bird like to cop.

42:26.011 --> 42:28.780
- What, Bird gets high?
- Not in the towers he don't.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.515
Avon ain't having
his people using.

42:30.616 --> 42:31.817
That's another rule.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.920
Never get high
on your own supply.

42:36.722 --> 42:38.489
Now, if I was
hunting Mr. Bird,

42:38.590 --> 42:40.391
I would consider
the best package right now

42:40.491 --> 42:41.793
to be the red dilley.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.729
That's over there
in Carrollton.

42:43.829 --> 42:46.965
That's if I have to be
constabulatin' like y'all.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.000
Carrollton?

42:49.100 --> 42:52.203
I know one thing,
when y'all run up on him,
y'all best be more...

42:52.303 --> 42:54.372
careful that is.

42:54.472 --> 42:55.907
Why is that?

42:56.007 --> 42:59.077
Oh, Bird will throw down
without thinkin', for sure.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.253
Hey, yo, Poot.

43:08.353 --> 43:10.388
Where Wallace
been at, man?

43:10.488 --> 43:12.858
I don't know.

43:14.492 --> 43:16.828
He in the wind, yo.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.864
Wallace been
fucked up.

43:18.964 --> 43:21.633
Since they got that
stickup boy, you know?

43:21.733 --> 43:24.235
Put him on the car
like that.

43:24.335 --> 43:26.772
Wallace all quiet
and shit.

43:26.872 --> 43:30.075
Don't even come out
his room some days.

43:34.379 --> 43:36.815
Lookin' for Dee,
you seen him?

43:42.921 --> 43:46.057
Yo, Dee.
Chillin', huh?

43:46.157 --> 43:48.059
What's up?

43:49.360 --> 43:50.796
Watcha doin' down
in the 'jects?

43:50.896 --> 43:53.298
I got somethin' man.

43:53.398 --> 43:55.333
Somethin' right.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.304
C'mon over.

44:01.239 --> 44:03.208
Where the shop at?

44:03.308 --> 44:05.343
Nothin' today.

44:05.443 --> 44:07.078
Well, see,
that's the thing,

44:07.178 --> 44:09.247
'cause if you
need more of that,

44:09.347 --> 44:11.082
I got this connect.

44:12.283 --> 44:13.584
Yeah?

44:13.685 --> 44:15.721
This guy I know from
the club, he from DC.

44:15.821 --> 44:17.622
And he got this thing
straight to New Orleans.

44:17.723 --> 44:20.391
- These Jamaicans down there.
- New Orleans?

44:21.893 --> 44:24.129
They offerin'
weight, Dee.

44:26.898 --> 44:28.333
My uncle know about it?

44:28.433 --> 44:29.667
Naw, see,

44:29.768 --> 44:31.536
this thing
on the side for me.

44:31.636 --> 44:34.873
And like, I got--
I got enough to turn
a New York quarter on it,

44:34.973 --> 44:37.108
but, you know, I don't have
what you got right here

44:37.208 --> 44:39.878
with the distribution.
You see what I'm sayin'?

44:41.112 --> 44:42.547
Hmm.

44:42.647 --> 44:44.115
I'm sayin', Dee,

44:44.215 --> 44:46.451
I'd be takin' all the risk
with them peoples.

44:46.551 --> 44:48.787
And once I have the package,
I bring it down here to y'all

44:48.887 --> 44:50.188
and you put it out.

44:50.288 --> 44:52.924
We do an even split
on what comes back.

44:53.725 --> 44:55.160
Right?

44:56.762 --> 44:58.830
Yeah, let me think
on that, a'ight?

44:58.930 --> 45:00.398
Finally get
some ends for us.

45:00.498 --> 45:02.000
You see
what I'm saying?

45:02.100 --> 45:04.069
Yeah.

45:04.169 --> 45:06.137
Yeah, mos def.

45:08.106 --> 45:10.408
I'm out.

45:10.508 --> 45:12.010
Be good.

45:12.110 --> 45:13.378
Think on that.

45:17.382 --> 45:20.318
( dog barking )

45:46.477 --> 45:48.513
( sniffing )

46:09.267 --> 46:10.936
Five-dollar hats,
right here.

46:11.036 --> 46:12.938
Five dollars, baby,
five dollars.

46:13.038 --> 46:16.374
Five dollars, yeah.
Everybody, five dollar
hats right here.

46:16.474 --> 46:19.444
Herc:
Which door are
we watching again?

46:19.544 --> 46:21.847
The vacant
next to the store.

46:21.947 --> 46:24.049
That's the shooting
gallery.

46:24.149 --> 46:26.151
Is he still
in there?

46:26.251 --> 46:29.354
Greggs is on the back
and we're on the front,
so you tell me.

46:36.527 --> 46:37.628
Yeah.

46:37.728 --> 46:39.364
- That it?
- Mm-hm

46:50.275 --> 46:52.878
( chattering )

46:57.015 --> 46:58.616
Five dollars hats,
right here.

46:58.716 --> 47:00.585
Five dollars, baby,
five dollars.

47:00.685 --> 47:02.020
I got you, I got you,
right here.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.588
Keep you cool, cover up
that head of yours.

47:03.688 --> 47:05.423
You know
what I mean?

47:07.859 --> 47:09.327
Can't beat that, right?
Five dollars.

47:09.427 --> 47:11.963
Five, five dollar hats,
right here, dog.

47:12.063 --> 47:14.265
Five dollar hats.

47:16.067 --> 47:17.768
Five dollar hat

47:17.869 --> 47:19.537
Fuck you, man.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.642
( laughing )

47:24.742 --> 47:26.177
Take him.

47:26.277 --> 47:27.979
Hey, shorty!

47:28.079 --> 47:29.580
- ( bottle shatters )
- Ah!

47:29.680 --> 47:31.449
Where's it at?
Get your hands back.

47:31.549 --> 47:33.885
- Get your hands back.
- Get off me, man!

47:33.985 --> 47:36.387
I got him.

47:36.487 --> 47:38.623
Get off me, man.

47:39.724 --> 47:41.026
Get the fuck off me.

47:41.126 --> 47:42.860
I got the feet.
I got the feet.

47:42.961 --> 47:44.462
Bitch-ass cops!

47:47.432 --> 47:49.134
There we go.

47:49.234 --> 47:50.768
Fuck, man.

47:50.868 --> 47:54.872
Oh, yeah, look what
we have here.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.609
Ooh, baby, baby.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.778
Get the fuck off me.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.614
Ow, my hand!

48:03.714 --> 48:04.849
Fucking bitch.

48:04.950 --> 48:06.617
Herc:
Shut the fuck up!

48:06.717 --> 48:09.154
Shit is tight, man.

48:13.491 --> 48:15.893
We should leave the couch
right there, right?

48:15.994 --> 48:17.128
Yeah, leave that shit
right there.

48:17.228 --> 48:19.998
That's nice
and straight.

48:26.371 --> 48:27.738
So?

48:27.838 --> 48:29.907
What's the deal,
String?

48:30.008 --> 48:31.742
How often y'all
changin' the stash?

48:31.842 --> 48:34.112
Every night
since we got jacked.

48:34.212 --> 48:36.047
Anybody on the team
gettin' high?

48:36.147 --> 48:38.349
Naw, man,
just the ol' touts.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.551
And they ain't handling
no money, no vials.

48:40.651 --> 48:42.988
Y'all been goin' in and out
of the vacants, right?

48:43.088 --> 48:45.790
Makin' sure them knockos
don't set up in there?

48:45.890 --> 48:47.025
Yeah, for sure.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.626
Y'all got
no cell phones?

48:48.726 --> 48:49.995
No house phones
neither, right?

48:50.095 --> 48:52.297
Naw, man, nothin'
but these pagers.

48:52.397 --> 48:55.700
And them pay boxes,
over there, that's it.

49:00.538 --> 49:03.174
All right, tear them
motherfuckers out.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.576
What?

49:06.744 --> 49:08.313
Tear out them phones.

49:08.413 --> 49:10.781
From now on,
y'all need a payphone,

49:10.881 --> 49:12.483
you walk a few blocks,

49:12.583 --> 49:14.685
and you do not use
the same phone more
than once a day.

49:14.785 --> 49:17.022
You hear me?

49:17.122 --> 49:19.457
- You hear me, right?
- Done.

49:19.557 --> 49:21.292
All right, Bey, tear
them motherfuckers out.

49:21.392 --> 49:23.194
Come on, man.

49:34.039 --> 49:37.108
Man, c'mon,
get off the phone.

49:43.414 --> 49:45.383
( beeps )

49:59.664 --> 50:03.934
So we wanted to hang

50:04.035 --> 50:07.372
the velvet backdrop
with the Lexus

50:07.472 --> 50:11.309
and the pit bulls,
but it's still out at
the dry cleaners.

50:13.511 --> 50:16.981
But seriously, folks,
we really wanted to show
all the jurors

50:17.082 --> 50:19.784
that you left our little
interrogation here

50:19.884 --> 50:23.754
without any more scuff marks
than what you brought in.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.290
Fuck you, fat man.

50:25.390 --> 50:28.359
( laughs )
Fuck you, fat man.

50:28.459 --> 50:32.330
Fuck you, fat man.
I thought we were friends.

50:39.704 --> 50:43.040
That gun is downstairs now
in the ballistics lab.

50:43.141 --> 50:45.076
It comes back
on a dead state's witness

50:45.176 --> 50:47.145
and you're gonna
see death row.

50:47.245 --> 50:48.746
You up for that?

50:48.846 --> 50:51.849
Suck my dick,
dyke cunt.

50:51.949 --> 50:54.152
Where's my lawyer at?

50:54.252 --> 50:57.222
Freak, cunt eater.

50:58.756 --> 51:01.759
You got one chance,
you stupid motherfucker.

51:01.859 --> 51:04.495
You roll back up
on the people you killed
William Gant for,

51:04.595 --> 51:07.765
or you gonna
eat the whole meal.

51:07.865 --> 51:09.367
Tell you what.

51:09.467 --> 51:11.302
Gimme this hand back,
step to me,

51:11.402 --> 51:13.204
and I fuck you
in all three holes.

51:13.304 --> 51:15.340
Fucking charmer,
this one.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.907
Bitch.

51:17.007 --> 51:18.776
Be-atch.

51:18.876 --> 51:21.045
You ain't
got shit on me.

51:21.146 --> 51:22.980
One of you
should go in.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.049
- Is she in trouble?
- Kima?

51:25.150 --> 51:26.851
He keeps this up,
she'll cut his ass.

51:26.951 --> 51:28.753
You ain't shit.

51:28.853 --> 51:31.256
You ain't
got shit on me.

51:35.092 --> 51:38.863
So, you're my eyeball
witness, huh?

51:38.963 --> 51:41.732
So, why'd you
step up on this?

51:41.832 --> 51:43.934
Bird triflin'
basically.

51:44.034 --> 51:46.471
He killed an everyday
workin' man and all.

51:46.571 --> 51:48.706
I mean, don't get it twisted,
I do some dirt too,

51:48.806 --> 51:52.577
but I ain't never
put my gun on nobody
who wasn't in the game.

51:52.677 --> 51:56.447
A man must
have a code.

51:56.547 --> 51:58.616
No doubt.

52:04.189 --> 52:06.357
Hey, man, I know you
from somewhere.

52:06.457 --> 52:07.692
Yeah?

52:07.792 --> 52:10.795
I was in Southwestern
before I came to homicide,

52:10.895 --> 52:12.096
worked Frederick Road.

52:12.197 --> 52:15.266
No, I mean,
back in the day.

52:17.968 --> 52:21.071
You go to Edmondson,
right?

52:21.172 --> 52:22.840
Yeah, you was
ahead of me.

52:22.940 --> 52:25.310
I remember you was the first
brother I ever seen play

52:25.410 --> 52:28.145
that sport with a stick,
uh, what's it called?

52:28.246 --> 52:31.182
- Lacrosse, man.
- For sure.

52:31.282 --> 52:33.684
Yeah, I was
all-metro attack.

52:33.784 --> 52:35.686
Prep school boys
used to pee themselves

52:35.786 --> 52:38.623
when they see ol' Bunk
coming at 'em.

52:41.492 --> 52:46.597
Oh, man,
so look here, homey.

52:46.697 --> 52:48.766
Seein' as how you bein'
all charitable

52:48.866 --> 52:50.301
with your recollections,

52:50.401 --> 52:53.238
what else you got in
the way of open murders?

52:53.338 --> 52:54.905
Goin' to Barksdale?

52:55.005 --> 52:56.374
Goin' anywhere.

52:56.474 --> 52:57.808
How far back
do you want me to go?

52:57.908 --> 52:59.777
As far as you need.

52:59.877 --> 53:01.879
Murder stay murder.

53:09.887 --> 53:11.889
Thanks.

53:17.127 --> 53:18.929
Gun matches.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.266
You're done, Bird.

53:21.366 --> 53:23.067
Last chance to grab
a little something

53:23.167 --> 53:24.535
for yourself
on a deal.

53:24.635 --> 53:28.273
Eat my shit first,
you downtown white whore.

53:34.879 --> 53:36.080
Yeah, that's right.

53:36.180 --> 53:39.784
And take this ugly-ass
cunt-eater with you too.

53:52.430 --> 53:54.899
Yo, I'm cuffed, man.

53:58.436 --> 54:00.571
You gonna at least give me
a fair chance, right?

54:00.671 --> 54:04.375
Yo, c'mon, man,
don't do me like that, man.

54:04.475 --> 54:07.645
- ( punches landing )
- ( Bird grunting )

54:07.745 --> 54:10.281
You fat fuck!

54:15.353 --> 54:17.455
Fulton and Baker,
you say?

54:17.555 --> 54:20.991
Uh-huh, it happened last year,
couple days after Easter.

54:21.091 --> 54:22.259
Uh-huh.

54:22.360 --> 54:23.794
This girl by the name
of Nee-Cee.

54:23.894 --> 54:26.163
She about 30, 35.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.098
Denise Redding.

54:28.198 --> 54:30.435
Yeah, I got it.

54:30.535 --> 54:33.738
Huh, I'll be damned.

54:36.040 --> 54:39.444
Bird sure know how to bring it
out in people, don't he?

54:39.544 --> 54:43.314
( phone ringing )

54:45.583 --> 54:47.485
Hello.

54:51.956 --> 54:54.825
The Lindsey case, right?

54:56.126 --> 54:59.597
No, Lindsey,
Martin Lindsey.

55:04.502 --> 55:06.904
Who the fuck is
Denise Redding?

55:09.774 --> 55:12.377
( laughing )

55:20.518 --> 55:22.252
The fuck did you
do to him?

55:22.353 --> 55:24.922
Here's yours, Mike.

55:34.198 --> 55:35.833
I don't even fucking
remember this one.

55:35.933 --> 55:38.636
- I swear I don't.
- Well, it's down.

55:38.736 --> 55:40.405
Our boy gave us
a statement,

55:40.505 --> 55:44.341
two witnesses and an ID
of your shooter.

55:44.442 --> 55:47.545
Take it with
our compliments.

55:47.645 --> 55:48.879
Sanny.

55:48.979 --> 55:51.281
What are you doing downtown
this time of night?

55:51.382 --> 55:53.918
Madame fucking LaRue.

55:54.018 --> 55:57.254
I gotta thank you,
Jaybird, you saved
my fucking life here.

55:57.354 --> 55:58.956
Only thing
I can't figure

55:59.056 --> 56:01.592
is I asked for help
on the Lindsey case.
Not this one.

56:01.692 --> 56:05.663
Hey, Mike.
Fuck the gypsy shit.

56:05.763 --> 56:08.966
These are the guys that
saved your ass, right here.

56:14.038 --> 56:16.073
Thanks.

56:19.109 --> 56:21.145
Hey, Jimmy.

56:23.448 --> 56:27.017
We gotta talk, man.

56:27.117 --> 56:29.420
It's about Rawls.

56:37.628 --> 56:40.097
( doorbell rings )

56:50.340 --> 56:53.143
( doorbell rings )

57:06.724 --> 57:09.460
Hmm.

57:09.560 --> 57:12.196
What's the plan here?

57:12.296 --> 57:14.565
Drunken fuck
on a Tuesday night?

57:14.665 --> 57:17.034
Is it Wednesday
morning?

57:17.134 --> 57:19.203
I'm not drunk.

57:22.206 --> 57:24.441
It's Rawls.

57:24.542 --> 57:27.177
He's going
after my badge.

57:29.914 --> 57:31.482
What?

57:31.582 --> 57:35.853
They're gonna
do me, Ronnie.

57:35.953 --> 57:39.990
They're gonna do me.
I love this fucking job
and they're gonna do me.

57:47.798 --> 57:49.867
Come on.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.978
( theme music playing )
