01:44.666 --> 01:47.633
Oh, great. Here, just set
them down. Easy, real easy.

01:47.666 --> 01:49.400
Just set them
down there. Real easy.

01:50.566 --> 01:51.533
Thank you.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.233
Can I help you?

01:57.266 --> 01:59.733
Uh, no, um,
I was just wondering

01:59.766 --> 02:01.300
where do you keep your T‐shirts?

02:01.333 --> 02:03.366
Well, I keep them in my drawer.

02:06.266 --> 02:08.199
Where do I come up with them?

02:10.600 --> 02:13.266
No, okay. Eh, ahem.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.433
The T‐shirts are right here

02:14.466 --> 02:16.066
and I think this one
is in your size.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.133
Hey, hey! Don't hustle me.

02:20.100 --> 02:23.666
Okay. Uh, you look around first
and‐and then I'll hustle you.

02:27.133 --> 02:30.233
My marbles. My slingshot.

02:30.266 --> 02:32.700
Ah! A third‐grade test paper.

02:32.733 --> 02:35.600
‐ Look at that, I got an A.
‐ Oh!

02:35.633 --> 02:36.600
Minus.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.433
Well, I saved all
this stuff from childhood.

02:43.466 --> 02:45.066
My parents sent everything.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.633
Ah‐ah‐ah. That's not trash.

02:49.666 --> 02:51.300
Looks like garbage to me.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.533
What this? A crutch?

03:00.566 --> 03:01.566
No.

03:03.533 --> 03:06.266
No, that's‐that's not a crutch.
It's a pogo stick.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.766
Well, of course it is.
Don't be ridiculous.

03:10.733 --> 03:14.066
You got a pogo ball
in here, somewhere?

03:14.100 --> 03:16.766
Balki, here. Let me
show you how this works.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.566
This is the greatest
toy in the world.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.733
I spent half my childhood
on this thing.

03:20.766 --> 03:22.100
Ooh!

[clanking]

03:32.133 --> 03:33.500
What else does it do?

03:36.166 --> 03:38.100
Nothing else. That's it.

03:40.333 --> 03:41.333
Guess you had to be there.

03:44.366 --> 03:47.533
Right, fine.
Fine, forget it.

03:47.566 --> 03:49.666
Just trying to share
a little bit of my life.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.666
Oh, cousin, I'm...I'm sorry.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.800
‐ Did you pay money for this?
‐ No, forget it.

03:55.833 --> 03:58.500
Oh, oh. My bike.

03:58.533 --> 04:01.766
Black Beauty.
How are you, fella?

04:01.800 --> 04:04.333
Balki. This is
my bike, Black Beauty.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.266
Black Beauty and I
grew up together.

04:11.299 --> 04:13.533
We even did a wheelie once,
didn't we, fella? Whoo.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.999
Hey, if you're finished
talking to the bicycle

04:18.033 --> 04:19.099
can I buy this pen
and get out of here?

04:20.533 --> 04:23.666
That's a good choice,
a very good choice.

04:23.699 --> 04:26.566
You know, they're only 50 cents
and they write forever.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.266
‐ You're a very smart shopper.
‐ Yeah, yeah.

04:29.299 --> 04:33.433
And, uh, a very busy
one too. Hey, what's this?

04:33.466 --> 04:36.533
"A pocket calculator,
that runs 9.95."

04:36.566 --> 04:38.033
But you'll need
batteries for that.

04:38.066 --> 04:39.366
No.

04:40.366 --> 04:43.333
Balki, he was stealing.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.499
I wasn't gonna steal it.

04:45.533 --> 04:48.299
Oh, cousin, he, uh,
probably meant to pay for it

04:48.333 --> 04:50.566
and then he forgot.

04:50.599 --> 04:53.566
Yeah, that's it.
I forgot. Can I go now?

04:53.599 --> 04:56.633
No, you cannot go now.
I want your name and address.

04:56.666 --> 04:58.299
I am going to call your mother.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.333
No, you're not.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.599
Oh, wait a minute. You‐you
forgot your‐your notebook.

05:02.633 --> 05:03.666
"Eddie."

05:03.699 --> 05:05.333
Eddie. Uh‐huh.

05:06.999 --> 05:09.666
"Eddie Harris,
315 Lincoln Avenue."

05:09.699 --> 05:10.699
He lives in our building.

05:10.733 --> 05:13.299
Well, I'll be snookered.
So do we.

05:17.466 --> 05:20.266
Howdy, neighbor.

05:20.299 --> 05:22.066
Look, I don't want any trouble.

05:22.099 --> 05:24.566
I just moved in.
I'll make you a deal.

05:24.599 --> 05:26.566
You don't call my mom, and I
won't come in your store again.

05:26.599 --> 05:27.599
Okay?

05:27.633 --> 05:31.199
Cousin, he's sorry.
Why don't you let him go?

05:33.633 --> 05:35.333
Okay.

05:35.366 --> 05:37.099
But don't
let it happen again.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.633
Boy.

05:41.666 --> 05:45.266
There goes a tragedy you see
a thousand times in a big city.

05:45.299 --> 05:47.566
A kid starts off shoplifting..

05:47.599 --> 05:50.299
...pretty soon he's stealing
hubcaps, then the whole car.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.166
Ends up in and out of prison.

05:52.199 --> 05:53.966
Never has a shot
at a decent life.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.433
Oh, cousin, that's terrible.

05:55.466 --> 05:57.566
Yeah, it is.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.999
If only someone would take
the time to point him

06:00.033 --> 06:01.633
in the right direction.

06:01.666 --> 06:03.199
Maybe he'd have a chance.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.399
Well, I gotta get
this stuff upstairs.

06:08.499 --> 06:11.033
But, cousin, we have the time.

06:13.399 --> 06:17.633
Well, maybe we could
spend some time with him.

06:17.666 --> 06:18.566
I mean, I'm pretty good
with kids.

06:18.599 --> 06:21.166
I grew up with a lot
of brothers and sisters.

06:21.199 --> 06:23.566
Tomorrow's Saturday.
We could start helping him then.

06:23.599 --> 06:25.199
Or we can start right now.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.399
‐ Give me 25 cents.
‐ Okay. Why?

06:27.433 --> 06:31.066
Well, we gotta pay for the pen,
we let him walk out with.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.299
[instrumental music]

06:40.133 --> 06:42.699
That's right, Mrs. Harris,
your son, Eddie.

06:42.733 --> 06:45.399
Yeah, we‐we‐we really do want
to spend the day with him.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.399
Yes, I'll be sure to
keep my hand on my wallet.

06:52.233 --> 06:54.499
I understand that
it's my funeral

06:54.533 --> 06:55.933
but I'm willing to
take that chance.

06:57.699 --> 07:01.499
Yes, a‐a‐alright. Uh, well,
thank you for the warning.

07:01.533 --> 07:03.333
Yeah, bye‐bye.

07:06.766 --> 07:08.133
Interesting woman.

07:10.266 --> 07:13.066
I'm beginning to get some
insight into Eddie Harris

07:13.099 --> 07:16.199
or Fast Eddie, as his mother
affectionately calls him.

07:18.099 --> 07:19.699
Why she call him that?

07:19.733 --> 07:22.999
Well, probably because
he's growing up too fast.

07:23.033 --> 07:24.399
He's been arrested twice
for shoplifting

07:24.433 --> 07:26.333
and she didn't go into it

07:26.366 --> 07:28.366
but they can't
go back to Florida.

07:34.233 --> 07:36.499
Oh, cousin, that the
saddest story I ever hear.

07:36.533 --> 07:38.133
Hmm.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.266
Except for the woman I read
about in the checkout line

07:41.299 --> 07:43.266
who had feet
the size of watermelons.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.633
Well, we can't help her, can we?

07:49.666 --> 07:52.066
No, no.

07:52.099 --> 07:54.566
‐ But we can help Eddie.
‐ Yes.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.699
We'll use the three P's.

07:56.733 --> 08:00.466
Patience, perseverance
and pride.

08:00.499 --> 08:03.633
Well, cousin, I was thinking
maybe we could, eh

08:03.666 --> 08:05.399
play boochi tag with him.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.033
No, no. No boochi tag.

08:08.066 --> 08:09.633
We're not playing
any Mypos games.

08:09.666 --> 08:12.166
Oh, but cousin, it's fun,
and it's really easy to play.

08:12.199 --> 08:14.099
Balki, I said no.

08:22.666 --> 08:24.966
You're it.

08:31.399 --> 08:33.599
Balki, I told you,
I'm not playing.

08:33.633 --> 08:35.366
Yes, I know, but..

08:35.399 --> 08:39.999
...you have to
because you're it.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.499
Boochi, boochi, boochi.

08:47.566 --> 08:49.733
And, you know, once a game
of boochi tag starts

08:49.766 --> 08:52.399
you have to play it
until it's over.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.066
No, I don't have to.

08:56.099 --> 09:00.366
Well, okay, in that case,
you just have to be it forever.

09:05.033 --> 09:07.299
Boochi, boochi, boochi.

09:12.066 --> 09:17.033
Balki, I'm not playing
any childish game of tag.

‐ Hmm? Oh.

‐ You're it.
‐ No, I'm not.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.199
Yes, you are.
I just tagged you.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.333
Yes, I know but I'm not it.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.199
Why not?

11:11.233 --> 11:13.166
Because I'm holding the boochi.

11:19.366 --> 11:21.333
Did I mention that
Dimitri was the boochi?

11:23.366 --> 11:24.366
You made that up.

11:24.399 --> 11:25.399
Well, I guess you'll
just have to go

11:25.433 --> 11:26.466
to Mypos to find out.

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
[knock on door]

11:31.999 --> 11:33.333
‐ Eddie.
‐ Eddie.

11:37.999 --> 11:39.199
Hi, Eddie.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.566
My mom told me I had
to come here to have fun.

11:41.599 --> 11:44.399
So let's get this over with.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.199
Well, we're gonna
have a great time.

11:46.233 --> 11:47.999
How do you feel about pottery?

11:48.033 --> 11:49.399
What?

11:49.433 --> 11:51.433
I thought our first
stop will be the museum.

11:51.466 --> 11:52.466
Are you serious?

11:52.499 --> 11:54.166
Or we could go on a walking tour

11:54.199 --> 11:57.066
of the major architectural
sights downtown.

11:57.099 --> 11:58.566
‐ I'm out of here.
‐ Or..

11:58.599 --> 12:02.166
Or we could play video games
until our eyes fall out

12:02.199 --> 12:04.599
and then eat hot dogs
until we bust a gut.

12:05.566 --> 12:06.666
Now, that sounds better.

12:06.699 --> 12:08.099
Okay, let's go.

12:08.133 --> 12:10.199
[instrumental music]

12:18.366 --> 12:20.166
You know, Balki.

12:20.199 --> 12:23.066
I really had
a great time yesterday.

12:23.099 --> 12:25.299
Yeah, well, I‐I
think Eddie did too.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.333
I saw him smile twice.

12:29.699 --> 12:31.433
Did you notice after we
bought him the 12th hot dog

12:31.466 --> 12:32.666
he said thank you?

12:34.633 --> 12:37.333
You know, I think we have
a gift for working with kids.

12:39.733 --> 12:41.366
Yeah, I do too.

12:47.599 --> 12:48.599
Balki.

12:50.499 --> 12:52.099
What are you doing?

12:53.699 --> 12:56.133
Looking for those
Monster Man tattoos.

12:58.699 --> 13:01.333
Surprise. I already got them.

13:16.533 --> 13:17.966
Maybe we should
give those to Eddie.

13:17.999 --> 13:18.699
I don't think so.

13:21.433 --> 13:24.499
You know, he's
not such a bad kid.

13:24.533 --> 13:27.166
I don't know why his mother
gives him such a hard time.

13:27.199 --> 13:29.299
If she just had a
little faith in him.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.099
Just a little bit
of trust, you know

13:31.133 --> 13:32.433
that would be all it would..

13:37.733 --> 13:40.099
Balki, Balki.

13:40.133 --> 13:42.299
‐ What, what?
‐ Black Beauty is gone.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.599
That rotten kid stole my bike.

13:44.633 --> 13:46.366
[instrumental music]

13:57.299 --> 14:00.399
Let's go upstairs to Eddie's
apartment and get Black Beauty.

14:00.433 --> 14:02.333
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

14:02.366 --> 14:04.399
How can you be sure it
was Eddie who took the bicycle?

14:04.433 --> 14:05.433
Who else could it be?

14:05.466 --> 14:06.466
He's the only thief who lives

14:06.499 --> 14:08.233
in the building.

14:08.266 --> 14:10.233
Wait, wait.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.566
Maybe he did take it
but just to borrow.

14:12.599 --> 14:14.566
Oh, I'm sure you have
a perfectly logical

14:14.599 --> 14:16.533
explanation for
his borrowing my bike?

14:16.566 --> 14:19.233
Well, of course I do.
Don't be ridiculous.

14:21.366 --> 14:23.066
‐ What is it?
‐ I don't know.

14:23.099 --> 14:26.199
But, cousin
...if you want to help somebody

14:26.233 --> 14:28.166
you've got to give him
the benefit of the dou‐wet.

14:28.199 --> 14:29.133
‐ Dou‐wet?
‐ Dou‐wet.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.933
You have to trust him.

14:33.199 --> 14:35.566
Balki, his own
mother doesn't trust him.

14:35.599 --> 14:38.133
The entire state of Florida
doesn't trust him.

14:38.166 --> 14:40.966
Eleven million
people can't be wrong.

14:40.999 --> 14:42.333
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Wait.

14:44.299 --> 14:46.566
Now, cousin, Eddie is coming
down here in a minute.

14:46.599 --> 14:48.399
You have to promise
you'll give him a chance.

14:48.433 --> 14:50.299
Remember the three P's.

14:50.333 --> 14:53.399
Patience, perseverance
and pride.

14:53.433 --> 14:55.333
Balki, when it comes
to Eddie, the only three P's

14:55.366 --> 14:58.199
are police,
prosecution and prison.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.466
Cousin, this is America.

15:03.499 --> 15:06.466
And every man is innocent
until proven guilty.

15:06.499 --> 15:09.133
You haven't even heard
his side of the story yet.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.666
Now, you promise me,
that you will keep an open mind.

15:11.699 --> 15:13.433
No. I don't have
to promise anything.

15:22.099 --> 15:24.199
What are you doing?

15:24.233 --> 15:25.733
Promise you'll keep
an open mind.

15:25.766 --> 15:27.166
No.

15:36.199 --> 15:37.399
‐ Promise?
‐ No!

15:39.733 --> 15:41.066
Well, then I'll just
hold you here

15:41.099 --> 15:43.633
until your hair falls out.

15:43.666 --> 15:46.466
Alright, alright. I promise
I will keep an open mind.

15:46.499 --> 15:47.299
Okay.

15:49.266 --> 15:51.199
[knock on door]

15:54.566 --> 15:56.666
So are you guys ready to go?

15:56.699 --> 15:58.566
You're not going
anywhere, punk.

16:01.733 --> 16:03.299
Cousin.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.699
‐ Alright, alright.
‐ Hey, what's going on?

16:05.733 --> 16:07.699
I thought we were
going to the movies.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.566
Cousin Larry is a little upset
because his bike is missing.

16:10.599 --> 16:12.999
Hey, don't look at me, I don't
know anything about his bike.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.199
‐ You see?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

16:14.233 --> 16:16.699
Then what's he doing
with this?

16:16.733 --> 16:19.266
It's one of Black Beauty's
streamer strands.

16:22.066 --> 16:24.466
‐ I found it in the hall.
‐ Oh, yeah, tell me another.

16:24.499 --> 16:27.499
I want my bike back,
you freckle‐faced felon.

16:34.099 --> 16:37.233
This is very important, and I
want you to tell me the truth.

16:38.699 --> 16:40.399
Did you take
Cousin Larry's bike?

16:40.433 --> 16:43.699
No, I did not take his bike.

16:43.733 --> 16:45.466
Well, there you go.

16:45.499 --> 16:47.699
I knew you didn't do it.

16:47.733 --> 16:50.433
You just can't
accept it, can you?

16:50.466 --> 16:52.633
When are you gonna see this kid
for what he really is?

16:52.666 --> 16:54.633
Does he have to
steal your shoes?

16:54.666 --> 16:56.199
Eddie, do me a favor
when you take his wallet

16:56.233 --> 16:57.966
leave his driver's license.

16:57.999 --> 17:00.399
‐ It means a lot to him.
‐ I don't need this from you.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.233
I get enough of this
garbage at home.

17:08.999 --> 17:12.165
‐ I'm calling Eddie's mother.
‐ No. Why you do that?

17:12.199 --> 17:13.532
Because she can
get my bike back.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.266
But‐but cousin,
Eddie did not take the bike.

17:16.299 --> 17:18.199
And‐and you'll get him
into trouble.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.066
Don't worry about Eddie.
I'm sure he'll continue a life

17:20.098 --> 17:21.699
of crime and someday
write a best‐selling book.

17:23.499 --> 17:25.098
But, cousin, he told us

17:25.133 --> 17:26.499
he told us that he didn't
take the bike.

17:26.532 --> 17:28.366
Why you can't
trust and believe him?

17:28.398 --> 17:30.599
Oh, trust Eddie?
Believe Eddie? Fine.

17:33.699 --> 17:35.399
Yeah, why don't we just
invite him down here

17:35.433 --> 17:37.166
to steal whatever
his little heart desires?

17:37.199 --> 17:39.533
No, no. Why stop at Eddie?

17:39.566 --> 17:42.466
Why not invite every thief
in the city?

17:42.499 --> 17:46.066
Hey, everybody,
we've got a new stereo.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.066
Anybody wanna steal it?
Help yourself!

17:48.099 --> 17:51.599
It's bargain day at Larry
and Balki's Rip‐Off City!

17:51.633 --> 17:53.266
Oh, cousin.

17:53.299 --> 17:56.399
‐ Aah! Ow! Oh. Oh.
‐ Ooh! Ooh!

17:56.433 --> 17:58.366
‐ Got you.
‐ Oh!

18:03.133 --> 18:04.399
You seem troubled.

18:05.999 --> 18:08.233
Do you think so?

18:08.266 --> 18:10.033
Yes, I can tell because
that vein on your neck

18:10.066 --> 18:11.499
is popping out and..

18:11.533 --> 18:13.233
...your upper lip
has disappeared altogether.

18:15.266 --> 18:17.333
I'm calling Eddie's mother.

18:17.366 --> 18:18.999
No, no, cousin, cousin..

18:19.033 --> 18:20.266
[knock on door]

18:20.299 --> 18:21.399
Cousin..

18:21.433 --> 18:23.433
[knock on door]

18:23.466 --> 18:26.266
Hello, Mrs. Harris,
this is Larry Appleton.

18:26.299 --> 18:29.199
Huh! Cousin, it's your bike.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.633
‐ It's about Eddie.
‐ Cousin.

18:31.666 --> 18:34.233
I'll have to call
you back. Bye‐bye.

18:36.166 --> 18:39.133
Jennifer, Black Beauty.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.366
Oh, thank you.
I've been working on my tan.

18:47.366 --> 18:49.299
It seems okay.
No nicks, no dents.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.966
Where did you find it?

18:50.999 --> 18:52.466
I found it in the hallway.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.933
I hope you didn't mind
me borrowing it.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.366
You borrowed it?

19:03.399 --> 19:05.233
Well, yes,
my car was in the garage

19:05.266 --> 19:06.566
and I needed to go pick it up.

19:06.599 --> 19:10.166
It was early,
and I didn't wanna bother you.

19:10.199 --> 19:12.266
Oh, it's no bother.
I didn't miss it at all.

19:13.999 --> 19:15.466
Didn't miss it at all?

19:15.499 --> 19:18.233
You were threatening a child
and yelling out the window.

19:21.733 --> 19:23.366
Was that you?

19:26.033 --> 19:29.999
Well, it's my childhood bike.
I'm kind of attached to it.

19:30.033 --> 19:31.999
We better go, Jennifer.

19:32.033 --> 19:33.533
I think it's obvious
that Larry's suffering

19:33.566 --> 19:35.399
from severe separation anxiety

19:35.433 --> 19:37.966
caused by the temporary loss
of his childhood bicycle.

19:40.433 --> 19:43.366
Where do you learn
stuff like this?

19:43.399 --> 19:45.333
I watch Oprah.

19:48.333 --> 19:51.033
‐ Thanks again, Larry.
‐ Oh, anytime, Jennifer.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.333
‐ Bye.
‐ Bye.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.366
‐ Got my bike back.
‐ Mm‐hm.

20:31.399 --> 20:32.266
Mm‐hm.

20:36.399 --> 20:38.399
‐ It wasn't stolen.
‐ No, no, no.

20:42.399 --> 20:44.666
‐ I know what you're thinking.
‐ Oh..

20:48.399 --> 20:53.266
You're thinking that
I didn't give Eddie a chance.

20:55.599 --> 20:59.033
And‐and you're
disappointed in me

20:59.066 --> 21:02.166
because when
the going got tough..

21:02.199 --> 21:04.133
...I gave up on him.

21:05.199 --> 21:07.099
And..

21:07.133 --> 21:11.066
And I owe you an apology.

21:11.099 --> 21:13.199
Uh..
No.

21:13.233 --> 21:15.133
No?

21:15.166 --> 21:19.299
No, but I owe somebody
an apology, don't I?

21:23.199 --> 21:24.199
Come in.

21:25.599 --> 21:27.966
My mom said I had to come
down here. What do you want?

21:27.999 --> 21:29.366
You got your bike back.

21:29.399 --> 21:30.933
Did you dust it
for my fingerprints?

21:32.999 --> 21:35.299
Eddie, I know
you didn't take it.

21:35.333 --> 21:37.366
I'm the one who's guilty.

21:37.399 --> 21:39.133
You stole your own bike?

21:42.166 --> 21:43.699
What a lame‐o.

21:46.599 --> 21:50.266
I'm guilty of accusing
you falsely. I was wrong.

21:50.299 --> 21:53.299
And...I'm sorry.

21:58.133 --> 21:59.099
Can I go now?

22:00.499 --> 22:03.399
No, I wanna talk to you
about my bike.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.133
See, I have this problem.

22:05.166 --> 22:08.199
I don't have time to ride it,
and it's only gonna gather dust.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.366
So I thought I'd give it
to somebody who could use it.

22:12.233 --> 22:15.133
‐ Are you interested?
‐ You're giving me your bike?

22:15.166 --> 22:17.266
Yeah.

22:17.299 --> 22:19.633
I hope it gives you as many
nice memories as it gave me.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
I don't get this guy.

22:25.033 --> 22:28.199
Sometimes I don't either.
He's very complex.

22:29.733 --> 22:32.233
But inside that little man..

22:32.266 --> 22:35.633
...beats a heart
as big as a liver.

22:40.099 --> 22:41.566
I never had a bike before.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.566
Well, you do now. Ha.

22:43.599 --> 22:45.999
Ah, thanks.
I'll take good care of it.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.399
Could you do me
one favor, though?

22:49.166 --> 22:50.966
Could you tell my mom
you gave it to me

22:50.999 --> 22:52.333
so she doesn't think
I stole it?

22:54.233 --> 22:56.199
Sure thing.

22:56.233 --> 22:59.666
‐ What are you gonna call it?
‐ I'm gonna call it "my bike."

23:16.466 --> 23:18.233
That was a very
nice thing you did.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.633
Ah, big deal.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.099
I gave him a bike.

23:22.133 --> 23:24.933
I also called him a thief
and a freckle‐faced felon.

23:27.466 --> 23:29.066
I thought
I was good with kids

23:29.099 --> 23:31.166
but I, I really
messed up this one.

23:31.199 --> 23:32.699
That's not true.

23:32.733 --> 23:34.299
You made a very good
start with him

23:34.333 --> 23:36.399
and then something
bad happened.

23:36.433 --> 23:38.633
And then you lost your mind.

23:43.233 --> 23:44.966
Thanks for clearing
that up for me.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.599
Cousin, you pointed him
in the right direction.

23:49.633 --> 23:51.999
And if he follows
your example..

23:52.033 --> 23:54.999
...someday he'll be
as good a man as you are.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.233
Well, I think maybe
he should aim higher.

23:59.766 --> 24:02.033
This Mypiot thinks
it's pretty high.

24:04.299 --> 24:05.533
I know how to
cheer you up.

24:07.466 --> 24:08.966
We could play
a game of boochi tag.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.666
Oh..

24:10.699 --> 24:12.633
No, no, Balki.

24:12.666 --> 24:15.266
I don't want
to play boochi tag.

24:22.366 --> 24:24.699
Boochi, boochi, boochi.

24:31.066 --> 24:31.699
Aah!

24:38.433 --> 24:41.366
