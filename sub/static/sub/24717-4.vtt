00:00.267 --> 00:01.892
Strange, unnatural forces...

00:01.893 --> 00:05.396
This is when you experienced
the time vortex?

00:05.397 --> 00:06.398
That's when it started.

00:10.478 --> 00:13.229
Mysterious disappearances...

00:12.370 --> 00:14.079
They find tracks in the snow.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.123
The tracks stop
in the middle of the lake.

00:16.123 --> 00:18.125
He completely disappeared.

00:18.126 --> 00:19.752
Could black holes

00:19.753 --> 00:22.254
not only be found
in the universe,

00:22.255 --> 00:25.549
but also here on Earth?

00:25.550 --> 00:28.302
And if so, could
they be facilitating

00:28.303 --> 00:31.138
extraterrestrial visitation?

00:31.139 --> 00:36.644
Eventually, it rips the
fabric of space and time.

00:36.645 --> 00:39.647
And that's where
all hell breaks loose.

01:10.533 --> 01:12.701
Menlo Park, California.

01:12.702 --> 01:15.495
May 2017.

01:15.496 --> 01:18.165
Scientists working

01:18.166 --> 01:20.459
at the SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory

01:20.460 --> 01:23.962
fire the world's most
powerful x-ray laser

01:23.963 --> 01:25.797
at a molecule.

01:25.798 --> 01:28.217
They were looking
to see what would happen

01:28.218 --> 01:30.719
if you took an atom
with a lot of electrons

01:30.720 --> 01:32.971
and hit it
with a high-energy X ray.

01:32.972 --> 01:37.809
Could you knock the electrons
out of orbit around the atom

01:37.810 --> 01:41.063
and produce something
that had very few electrons?

01:41.064 --> 01:43.523
But the system behaved
very differently than expected.

01:43.524 --> 01:46.902
At first,
the experiment goes as planned.

01:46.903 --> 01:50.739
Electrons are knocked out
of their orbits like pinballs.

01:50.740 --> 01:54.159
But then, in one quadrillionth
of a second,

01:54.160 --> 01:58.121
a powerful force
sucks electrons into a void,

01:58.122 --> 02:02.751
and the molecule
dramatically explodes.

02:02.752 --> 02:05.963
It would suddenly start
sucking in all the electrons

02:05.964 --> 02:07.506
from the rest of the molecule

02:07.507 --> 02:11.176
in a manner that they just
had not anticipated.

02:11.177 --> 02:14.179
The electrons
were then compressed

02:14.180 --> 02:18.350
and then drew other electrons
into the process.

02:18.351 --> 02:21.896
And, by golly,
it looked like a black hole.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.941
A black hole?

02:25.942 --> 02:27.609
A region of space

02:27.610 --> 02:30.487
that exhibits such a strong
gravitational field

02:30.488 --> 02:35.659
that nothing, not even light,
can escape from it?

02:35.660 --> 02:37.786
Fundamentally,
they're just a lot of mass

02:37.787 --> 02:39.496
crammed into a very small space.

02:39.497 --> 02:41.999
What does that mean?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.544
That means there's a very strong
gravitational field around them.

02:45.545 --> 02:47.629
Light can't even escape.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.423
And that's where it gets
the name "black hole."

02:49.424 --> 02:52.843
When one puts in spin

02:52.844 --> 02:54.761
into the black hole equations,

02:54.762 --> 02:58.807
one gets a much more exotic
phenomenon.

02:58.808 --> 03:01.560
What happens then
is you get a vortex

03:01.561 --> 03:06.356
around the black hole, a
vortex of space-time.

03:06.357 --> 03:08.233
And here we actually saw

03:08.234 --> 03:10.402
something that resembled
a black hole,

03:10.403 --> 03:12.029
except it wasn't gravitational.

03:12.030 --> 03:14.323
It was electromagnetic.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.534
That is, it used the power
of laser beams.

03:17.535 --> 03:19.161
Now, how's that possible?

03:19.162 --> 03:22.748
Well, it turns out
that in Einstein's theory,

03:22.749 --> 03:25.375
not just gravity,
but any form of energy...

03:25.376 --> 03:27.127
If it's concentrated enough...

03:27.128 --> 03:30.547
Could become a black hole.

03:30.548 --> 03:34.259
For decades,
since their discovery,

03:34.260 --> 03:36.386
scientists have long believed

03:36.387 --> 03:40.182
that black holes could
only exist in outer space.

03:40.183 --> 03:41.683
But if that were true,

03:41.684 --> 03:43.685
how is it
that they can be simulated

03:43.686 --> 03:46.814
in an Earth-based laboratory?

03:48.858 --> 03:50.901
Normally,
when we think of black holes,

03:50.902 --> 03:54.571
we think of a collapsed star
and a great mass.

03:54.572 --> 03:57.032
But with these new experiments,
it's showing us

03:57.033 --> 03:59.785
that black holes can be created
in different ways,

03:59.786 --> 04:02.788
including
with electromagnetic energy

04:02.789 --> 04:06.041
or high-energy pulses
in a laboratory.

04:06.042 --> 04:08.543
And so, therefore,

04:08.544 --> 04:11.922
black holes
could be in any place.

04:11.923 --> 04:14.841
There's areas around the Earth

04:14.842 --> 04:16.551
that we don't understand,

04:16.552 --> 04:19.512
that have
unusual characteristics

04:19.514 --> 04:21.723
similar to a black hole,
and so it's possible

04:21.724 --> 04:25.852
that these places
are also black holes.

04:25.853 --> 04:29.481
If black holes
can exist here on Earth,

04:29.482 --> 04:31.983
could their presence
help to explain

04:31.984 --> 04:34.945
the numerous reports
of strange phenomena

04:34.946 --> 04:39.324
going back thousands of years?

04:39.325 --> 04:44.246
On Earth there have been stories
of people missing time

04:44.247 --> 04:49.126
or jumping a distance
at much faster speeds

04:49.127 --> 04:52.754
than what it would've taken
in their plane or in their boat.

04:52.755 --> 04:54.965
And that raises the question

04:54.966 --> 04:57.426
whether very strange things

04:57.427 --> 05:01.680
apply in the vicinity
of a black hole.

05:01.681 --> 05:03.348
Maybe a vortex opens.

05:03.349 --> 05:05.767
Maybe some type of passageway

05:05.768 --> 05:09.187
into the other realms
and dimensions

05:09.188 --> 05:11.273
which exist all around us.

05:11.274 --> 05:14.693
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

05:14.694 --> 05:18.447
that evidence of humans
taking incredible journeys

05:18.448 --> 05:21.158
through time-space portals
exists

05:21.159 --> 05:24.286
in ancient texts
from all over the world.

05:24.287 --> 05:26.246
One such example
can even be found

05:26.247 --> 05:28.498
in the Old Testament
of the Hebrew Bible

05:28.499 --> 05:33.463
and involves the story of Moses
on Mount Sinai.

05:36.591 --> 05:42.512
Something very bizarre
happened on Mount Sinai.

05:42.513 --> 05:45.557
There's an ancient legend
that states

05:45.558 --> 05:51.188
when God calls Moses to
heaven, a cloud descended.

05:51.189 --> 05:56.151
And then it curiously states
a door opened in the cloud,

05:56.152 --> 05:58.653
and Moses walked in.

05:58.654 --> 06:01.991
The door closed behind him,
and he ascended.

06:03.159 --> 06:05.160
According to the Bible,

06:05.161 --> 06:08.997
Moses ascends
for 40 days and 40 nights.

06:08.998 --> 06:11.666
Does not eat,
does not drink, does not sleep.

06:11.667 --> 06:15.212
40 days passed for us on Earth.

06:15.213 --> 06:18.924
How much time passed
for Moses in heaven?

06:18.925 --> 06:22.928
What was the opening
at Mount Sinai?

06:22.929 --> 06:26.139
It sounds like the cloud

06:26.140 --> 06:29.267
was some type
of a transportational device

06:29.268 --> 06:33.438
within the context
of an open vortex.

06:33.439 --> 06:36.525
The entire mountain

06:36.526 --> 06:41.696
seemed to have been subject
to some radical alteration

06:41.697 --> 06:45.534
of the normal physical laws
that govern us.

06:45.535 --> 06:49.746
If this has any kind of
a literal understanding to it,

06:49.747 --> 06:51.873
then a doorway to heaven

06:51.874 --> 06:54.251
would have been an alteration

06:54.252 --> 06:57.212
in the fabric of space
as we understand it today,

06:57.213 --> 06:59.714
possibly of time itself.

06:59.715 --> 07:02.759
In light of
our modern understandings,

07:02.760 --> 07:04.886
we need to reinvestigate

07:04.887 --> 07:07.389
what the Bible
is actually teaching us.

07:07.390 --> 07:12.185
If black holes
can and do exist here on Earth,

07:12.186 --> 07:15.438
what impact would they have?

07:15.439 --> 07:18.900
Could they open up gateways
that, if harnessed,

07:18.901 --> 07:21.778
would allow us
to quickly travel back and forth

07:21.779 --> 07:23.947
through space and time?

07:23.948 --> 07:28.451
And if so, have they been used
by extraterrestrials

07:28.452 --> 07:31.204
to visit Earth for centuries?

07:31.205 --> 07:34.082
Perhaps further clues
can be found

07:34.083 --> 07:38.044
by examining ancient knowledge
about powerful vortices

07:38.045 --> 07:40.715
carved in stone.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.958
Space.

07:45.959 --> 07:49.462
March 26, 2016.

07:49.463 --> 07:53.591
The Hitomi,
an x-ray astronomy satellite

07:53.592 --> 07:56.969
launched by the Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency

07:56.970 --> 07:59.013
just five weeks earlier,

07:59.014 --> 08:02.391
begins spinning uncontrollably.

08:02.392 --> 08:05.353
The on board
altitude control system

08:05.354 --> 08:07.772
is unable to slow down
the spinning,

08:07.773 --> 08:09.690
and over a period of hours,

08:09.691 --> 08:12.318
the satellite breaks
into ten fragments

08:12.319 --> 08:15.322
and is observed
tumbling out of orbit.

08:17.074 --> 08:19.867
In the ensuing investigation,

08:19.868 --> 08:22.912
a significant factor emerges:

08:22.913 --> 08:26.415
the satellite's
Star Tracker system,

08:26.416 --> 08:29.585
designed to keep it
properly oriented,

08:29.586 --> 08:31.254
experienced glitches

08:31.255 --> 08:33.130
whenever the satellite
passed through

08:33.131 --> 08:34.715
a field of high radiation

08:34.716 --> 08:38.678
known as
the South Atlantic Anomaly.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.179
The Earth's magnetic field

08:41.181 --> 08:44.559
is generated
deep in its interior

08:44.560 --> 08:49.355
by motions of liquid iron
and other substances,

08:49.356 --> 08:52.859
the thermal currents generated
by a radioactive decay

08:52.860 --> 08:54.318
in the core, etcetera.

08:54.319 --> 08:56.696
So it's a very complex
phenomenon.

08:56.697 --> 08:59.615
What we see on the surface

08:59.616 --> 09:02.910
looks like a magnetic field
of a bar magnet.

09:02.911 --> 09:06.247
But apparently, there's
some kind of imperfection in it

09:06.248 --> 09:08.541
that is very deep,

09:08.542 --> 09:11.919
and it creates
a very localized reversal

09:11.920 --> 09:13.838
of the Earth's magnetic field.

09:13.839 --> 09:16.799
This is called
the South Atlantic Anomaly.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.051
Astronauts flying
through this region...

09:19.052 --> 09:21.470
Or satellites... are exposed

09:21.471 --> 09:26.476
to a very brief
but intense field of radiation.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.397
Comprising the area
of the magnetosphere

09:31.398 --> 09:35.902
above much of South America
as well as the Atlantic Ocean,

09:35.903 --> 09:38.779
the South Atlantic Anomaly
has caused problems

09:38.780 --> 09:41.741
with spacecraft for decades.

09:41.742 --> 09:43.409
It is for this reason

09:43.410 --> 09:45.786
that the International
Space Station

09:45.787 --> 09:49.415
requires extra shielding
when passing by it

09:49.416 --> 09:53.753
and why NASA laptops have
crashed when the space shuttle

09:53.754 --> 09:56.924
flies through
its intense levels of radiation.

09:58.926 --> 10:02.011
When you go through
the South Atlantic Anomaly,

10:02.012 --> 10:03.804
strange things happen.

10:03.805 --> 10:07.183
There are flashes of light.
Electronics will malfunction.

10:07.184 --> 10:10.353
And even spacecraft
have to be specially shielded

10:10.354 --> 10:12.271
to go through this area.

10:12.272 --> 10:15.107
Although scientists understand

10:15.108 --> 10:17.401
the nature
of the South Atlantic Anomaly,

10:17.402 --> 10:20.780
there is disagreement
as to its effects.

10:20.781 --> 10:22.573
And there is an increased number

10:22.574 --> 10:25.117
who believe
it may also create vortexes

10:25.118 --> 10:29.121
that can alter
both time and space.

10:29.122 --> 10:34.293
Nature has found
thresholds and doorways

10:34.294 --> 10:36.837
that people
don't even know exist

10:36.838 --> 10:40.758
that can open under these
specific circumstances.

10:40.759 --> 10:44.512
If one can change the metric
of space-time directly

10:44.513 --> 10:49.058
with electromagnetic fields,
then nature itself,

10:49.059 --> 10:50.851
because of the enormous
electromagnetic fields

10:50.852 --> 10:52.937
it develops
in weather disturbances,

10:52.938 --> 10:56.857
for example,
could possibly create its own

10:56.858 --> 10:58.985
electrodynamic black hole

10:58.986 --> 11:02.321
or rotating
black hole solutions.

11:02.322 --> 11:05.074
Many ancient astronaut theorists

11:05.075 --> 11:07.576
support this claim and suggest

11:07.577 --> 11:10.454
that our ancestors
were so aware of it

11:10.455 --> 11:13.290
that they even carved
numerous representations of it

11:13.291 --> 11:17.087
in stone all over the world.

11:20.298 --> 11:23.592
Ingá, Brazil.

11:23.593 --> 11:26.012
Here stands
an ancient rock formation

11:26.013 --> 11:28.305
known as the Ingá Stone.

11:28.306 --> 11:31.934
The formation is covered
with carved symbols

11:31.935 --> 11:35.438
that are of unknown origin
and meaning.

11:35.439 --> 11:38.065
But some researchers claim

11:38.066 --> 11:41.736
to have at least partially
deciphered the carvings

11:41.737 --> 11:44.447
and suggest they reveal
that whoever made them

11:44.448 --> 11:49.118
had advanced knowledge
of both astronomy and physics.

11:49.119 --> 11:52.038
In the Ingá River in Brazil,
we find this incredible

11:52.039 --> 11:56.459
150-foot-long, 12-foot-tall
stone, the Ingá Stone.

11:56.460 --> 12:00.046
It's covered with the most
immaculate carvings,

12:00.047 --> 12:03.883
highly detailed
but totally mysterious.

12:03.884 --> 12:07.553
We don't know who exactly
created them for what purpose.

12:07.554 --> 12:10.389
They have
the most strange carvings

12:10.390 --> 12:13.392
on the rock, on the surface.

12:13.393 --> 12:16.103
There's also another petroglyphs
and geoglyphs

12:16.104 --> 12:18.314
around the Ingá Stone,

12:18.315 --> 12:21.901
and some of them
have to do with constellations:

12:21.902 --> 12:24.904
the Southern Cross, Milky Way,

12:24.905 --> 12:28.407
the Orion constellation,
and other constellation

12:28.408 --> 12:31.118
that were describing in area,
as well.

12:31.119 --> 12:34.371
Some people interpret
that the spirals around it

12:34.372 --> 12:36.791
have to do with energy,
vortex of energy.

12:36.792 --> 12:39.668
There is magnetic anomalies
on the Ingá Stone,

12:39.669 --> 12:41.921
that's for sure.

12:41.922 --> 12:44.256
We know that the Ingá Stone

12:44.257 --> 12:46.675
contains astronomical data.

12:46.676 --> 12:49.303
And what's interesting about
this is that the native peoples

12:49.304 --> 12:51.806
typically didn't make
astronomical depictions.

12:51.807 --> 12:55.059
They made depictions
of supernatural beings.

12:55.060 --> 12:57.645
So this kind of hints us
in the idea

12:57.646 --> 13:00.064
that maybe the origin
of this knowledge

13:00.065 --> 13:02.859
is indeed
extraterrestrial beings.

13:04.861 --> 13:07.822
Curiously, the Ingá Stone

13:07.823 --> 13:11.033
is located within
the exact same geographical area

13:11.034 --> 13:14.161
as the South Atlantic Anomaly.

13:14.162 --> 13:17.957
Is it possible that the stone's
enigmatic carvings

13:17.958 --> 13:21.502
were inspired by the arrival
of an ancient space traveler,

13:21.503 --> 13:25.422
one who had landed here
centuries ago?

13:25.423 --> 13:28.759
And if so, could
the South Atlantic Anomaly,

13:28.760 --> 13:32.471
while perhaps the largest
and best known of its kind,

13:32.472 --> 13:34.682
be one of many similar anomalies

13:34.683 --> 13:36.643
that exist here on Earth?

13:39.479 --> 13:42.231
The Bermuda Triangle.

13:42.232 --> 13:44.859
The Devil's Sea.

13:44.860 --> 13:47.444
Easter Island.

13:47.445 --> 13:50.322
The Indus Valley.

13:50.323 --> 13:53.576
These are just a few
of 12 triangular zones

13:53.577 --> 13:55.411
spaced evenly around the globe

13:55.412 --> 13:59.915
known for disappearances,
high energy,

13:59.916 --> 14:02.960
and other
unexplainable phenomena.

14:02.961 --> 14:04.753
Collectively,

14:04.754 --> 14:08.674
they have been referred to
as the vile vortices.

14:08.675 --> 14:13.637
The Scottish-born biologist
and cryptozoologist

14:13.638 --> 14:19.560
and writer Ivan T. Sanderson
came up with a theory

14:19.561 --> 14:22.146
to do with paranormal phenomena

14:22.147 --> 14:25.149
occurring at different parts
of the world.

14:25.150 --> 14:30.196
He believed that there
were 12 principal locations

14:30.197 --> 14:33.073
where this would actually
take place,

14:33.074 --> 14:37.787
and he referred to them
as the vile vortices.

14:41.041 --> 14:45.711
In other words, that they were
quite violent in their action.

14:45.712 --> 14:47.713
Sanderson was trying to find

14:47.714 --> 14:51.091
an explanation to all
of these disappearances.

14:51.092 --> 14:55.638
And it was this geometric
pattern on the Earth

14:55.639 --> 15:00.226
that he thought was a solution
to what was going on,

15:00.227 --> 15:03.938
and that certain spots on
the Earth were just anomalistic

15:03.939 --> 15:07.399
and had these strange
energy patterns.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.653
There is no question
that his work proves to me

15:10.654 --> 15:12.363
that there's a lot more

15:12.364 --> 15:14.531
that we don't understand
about this planet.

15:14.532 --> 15:17.284
Whether it's natural
or some kind

15:17.285 --> 15:19.787
of paranormal episode,
I don't know.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.831
But there's no question
this planet

15:22.832 --> 15:27.419
is very, very unusual when it
comes to these certain spots.

15:27.420 --> 15:30.297
If extraterrestrials
visited Earth

15:30.298 --> 15:33.801
in the distant past,
maybe they simply harnessed

15:33.802 --> 15:36.011
what was already present
in the Earth.

15:36.012 --> 15:39.515
And that they had a technology
to bring these places into

15:39.516 --> 15:41.850
a higher energetic state
where they could use them

15:41.851 --> 15:45.437
as black holes, or wormholes,
or for other purposes.

15:45.438 --> 15:50.025
Is it possible that
the so-called vile vortices,

15:50.026 --> 15:54.113
in addition to phenomena like
the South Atlantic Anomaly,

15:54.114 --> 15:57.449
could help explain
mysterious disappearances?

15:57.450 --> 15:59.660
And that there
are locations on Earth

15:59.661 --> 16:01.537
where conditions are optimal

16:01.538 --> 16:04.832
for the creation
of black holes or portals?

16:04.833 --> 16:08.335
Areas where humans could,
without warning,

16:08.336 --> 16:12.298
be suddenly thrust
into another space or time?

16:12.299 --> 16:14.300
If you look at
the bottom of a black hole,

16:14.301 --> 16:17.469
it could be a place where you
want to think of a hole,

16:17.470 --> 16:20.639
actually, in space and time,
that reconnects somewhere else.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.058
And so you can go through
the black hole, like a door,

16:23.059 --> 16:25.811
or a tunnel, and end up either
in another part of the universe,

16:25.812 --> 16:28.480
or in another actual universe.

16:28.481 --> 16:31.525
Could extraterrestrials

16:31.526 --> 16:33.694
have used these so-called,
"portals"

16:33.695 --> 16:37.323
to visit the Earth
in the distant past?

16:37.324 --> 16:41.410
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

16:41.411 --> 16:43.787
and suggest further clues
can be found

16:43.788 --> 16:46.582
by investigating
one of the places

16:46.583 --> 16:49.668
that in recent decades
has been the site

16:49.669 --> 16:52.755
of more curious disappearances
than any other:

16:52.756 --> 16:55.508
the Bermuda Triangle.

16:57.803 --> 17:00.722
Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

17:00.723 --> 17:05.351
December 5, 1945.

17:05.352 --> 17:09.063
Five Navy Avenger
torpedo bombers,

17:09.064 --> 17:11.733
collectively known as Flight 19,

17:11.733 --> 17:15.778
set out on a training mission
over the Bermuda Triangle.

17:15.779 --> 17:19.449
Without warning,
all five bombers

17:19.450 --> 17:22.911
experience malfunctions
with their on board instruments.

17:22.912 --> 17:25.288
They contact air control

17:25.289 --> 17:29.584
and report their mysterious
difficulties.

17:29.585 --> 17:33.922
All five of their compasses
were not working correctly.

17:33.923 --> 17:37.133
They had two navigational
instruments that they could use,

17:37.134 --> 17:39.218
and they were not
working properly, either.

17:39.219 --> 17:41.095
It caused total confusion.

17:41.096 --> 17:42.931
They didn't know their position,

17:42.932 --> 17:46.100
so they did what a lot of other
pilots have done in the past:

17:46.101 --> 17:47.894
they made a series of turns.

17:47.895 --> 17:51.689
And that's what causes pilots
to become confused.

17:51.690 --> 17:55.652
The planes disappeared
from radar,

17:55.653 --> 17:58.988
and their last communication
consisted of nothing

17:58.989 --> 18:00.991
but eerie static.

18:02.952 --> 18:05.995
The Navy immediately launched
two seaplanes

18:05.996 --> 18:08.331
to search
for the missing bombers.

18:08.332 --> 18:13.127
Just 20 minutes after takeoff,
they, too, vanished.

18:13.128 --> 18:18.299
The unusual thing is they
didn't find any parts.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.636
No life jackets or life rafts.

18:22.471 --> 18:26.099
Despite some claims
in more modern times

18:26.100 --> 18:28.643
that Grumman Avengers
have been discovered

18:28.644 --> 18:32.146
that might have been Flight 19,

18:32.147 --> 18:34.774
the actuality
of the case is that

18:34.775 --> 18:38.362
it is a mystery
of exactly what happened.

18:39.989 --> 18:42.907
The disappearance of Flight 19

18:42.908 --> 18:45.660
is one of many bizarre
and unexplainable events

18:45.661 --> 18:48.830
that have taken place in
the area that is now known

18:48.831 --> 18:51.666
as the Bermuda Triangle.

18:51.667 --> 18:56.546
The Bermuda Triangle is really
located off of-of Florida.

18:56.547 --> 19:00.967
The northern point of it
is the island of Bermuda.

19:00.968 --> 19:04.512
It then goes down to,
essentially, southern Florida,

19:04.513 --> 19:06.848
and then out into the Bahamas.

19:06.849 --> 19:09.642
And this is an area
that has historically

19:09.643 --> 19:11.186
had strange phenomenon.

19:13.897 --> 19:16.566
It is something that goes back

19:16.567 --> 19:20.361
all the way to the time
of Christopher Columbus

19:20.362 --> 19:24.198
as he passed through this area,
because he found

19:24.199 --> 19:27.869
that his compasses, strangely,
didn't work

19:27.870 --> 19:31.080
as he passed through what we now
know as the Bermuda Triangle.

19:31.081 --> 19:33.750
He also saw mysterious lights

19:33.751 --> 19:36.210
in the same area
just a few days later,

19:36.211 --> 19:39.756
after his compasses failed.

19:39.757 --> 19:43.301
<i>The famous Mary Celeste ship
was found</i>

19:43.302 --> 19:46.387
in the Bermuda Triangle without
any crew on it at all,

19:46.388 --> 19:49.057
and no one could explain it.

19:49.058 --> 19:51.893
What's very bizarre about some
of these instances

19:51.894 --> 19:56.314
is that these people vanished
in front of multiple witnesses,

19:56.315 --> 19:58.900
in circumstances that seemed
to be impossible.

19:58.901 --> 20:00.777
It's like these people were here

20:00.778 --> 20:02.904
and they suddenly
just blinked out,

20:02.905 --> 20:05.324
as if they walked off
the surface of the Earth.

20:07.284 --> 20:09.243
My guess is that you're dealing

20:09.244 --> 20:11.245
with something
that is dimensional.

20:11.246 --> 20:13.247
And when you go through it,

20:13.248 --> 20:16.168
there's that possibility
you may never come back.

20:17.753 --> 20:20.755
For decades,
scientists and researchers

20:20.756 --> 20:22.590
have struggled to find a cause

20:22.591 --> 20:24.926
for the mysterious
disappearances.

20:24.927 --> 20:28.596
They are equally puzzled
by the numerous reports

20:28.597 --> 20:30.973
of everything
from instrument failure

20:30.974 --> 20:33.643
to compasses that, strangely,
point to true north

20:33.644 --> 20:37.105
instead of magnetic north.

20:37.106 --> 20:40.608
Electromagnetic phenomenon
associated with thunderstorms,

20:40.609 --> 20:45.655
that can perhaps open up portals
in space-time

20:45.656 --> 20:48.449
that we never
would have thought possible.

20:48.450 --> 20:51.120
An analogy is that lightning...

20:52.621 --> 20:54.288
...is still poorly understood.

20:54.289 --> 20:56.999
Lightning typically carries
several million volts.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.962
This is not sufficient voltage
to jump from a cloud,

21:00.963 --> 21:04.799
miles above the ground,
to the ground or between clouds.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.843
Yet, nature does it.

21:06.844 --> 21:09.971
Combine that
with the strange location

21:09.972 --> 21:12.140
of the Bermuda Triangle,

21:12.141 --> 21:15.726
with the collision point of
these cold and warm currents...

21:15.727 --> 21:20.858
You can have a playground
for exotic physics, I believe.

21:22.526 --> 21:25.319
Might storm clouds,
lightning flashes

21:25.320 --> 21:27.155
and powerful ocean currents

21:27.156 --> 21:29.657
located within
the Bermuda Triangle

21:29.658 --> 21:33.995
have unexpected,
and otherworldly effects?

21:33.996 --> 21:37.165
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

21:37.166 --> 21:40.001
such an audacious theory
is possible,

21:40.002 --> 21:43.421
and point to the story
of pilot Bruce Gernon

21:43.422 --> 21:46.549
as the best evidence
that such incredible phenomena

21:46.550 --> 21:50.219
can and do exist.

21:50.220 --> 21:57.351
On December 4, 1970,
almost 25 years to the day

21:57.352 --> 22:00.856
after the disappearance
of Flight 19...

22:02.691 --> 22:06.736
...a pilot by the name
of Bruce Gernon

22:06.737 --> 22:09.363
was in an aircraft flying

22:09.364 --> 22:13.701
between Andros Island
and the island of Bimini,

22:13.702 --> 22:18.790
when he had an absolute
incredible experience.

22:23.587 --> 22:26.547
The controls on his plane
also went crazy.

22:26.548 --> 22:30.218
He felt, in the end,
that somehow he had been

22:30.219 --> 22:33.471
in the Bermuda Triangle
when it was activated.

22:33.472 --> 22:36.515
Since that time,
researchers have been trying

22:36.516 --> 22:40.312
to find out exactly what
happened during that flight.

22:47.319 --> 22:49.487
In March 2018,

22:49.488 --> 22:54.075
ancient astronaut theorist and
author David Childress traveled

22:54.076 --> 22:56.744
to an airfield
in West Palm Beach, Florida...

22:56.745 --> 22:58.746
- Hi.
- Hi. -...To meet face-to face

22:58.747 --> 23:00.456
with one of the very few men

23:00.457 --> 23:03.584
who experienced
the strange power

23:03.585 --> 23:06.879
of the Bermuda Triangle,
and survived.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.923
So what is our plan today?

23:08.924 --> 23:11.634
Well, we're gonna recreate
our flight

23:11.635 --> 23:14.428
that I had in, uh, 1970.

23:14.429 --> 23:16.138
And I can show you
on the chart here.

23:16.139 --> 23:18.474
We're gonna go direct
from Palm Beach

23:18.475 --> 23:20.101
right to this curved area

23:20.102 --> 23:22.436
of Andros Island
on the western shore.

23:22.437 --> 23:25.856
And we're gonna go down to a
thousand feet at this point.

23:25.857 --> 23:28.109
And that's where my experience
in 1970 began.

23:28.110 --> 23:30.278
I am the only living person

23:30.279 --> 23:32.446
that has flown through
the heart of it, and then exited

23:32.447 --> 23:35.825
what I call a time-tunnel vortex
and survived.

23:35.826 --> 23:38.119
So have you ever retraced
your flight?

23:38.120 --> 23:40.871
I've never been
on the exact flight path

23:40.872 --> 23:43.124
that I was
when I had this event.

23:43.125 --> 23:45.293
And that's what I'd like
to take you through today,

23:45.294 --> 23:46.627
the exact flight path.

23:46.628 --> 23:48.462
Into the Bermuda Triangle.

23:48.463 --> 23:50.840
And this isn't
a one-way flight, is it?

23:50.841 --> 23:52.383
No sir. We'll be back.

23:52.384 --> 23:54.720
Okay. I'm ready.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.088
At the North
Palm Beach County Airport,

23:59.089 --> 24:03.843
located 20 miles outside
of West Palm Beach, Florida,

24:03.844 --> 24:06.512
author and researcher
David Childress

24:06.513 --> 24:09.849
and professional pilot
Bruce Gernon are about

24:09.850 --> 24:12.893
to retrace the exact path
of a mysterious flight

24:12.894 --> 24:16.438
that Gernon made
nearly five decades ago.

24:16.439 --> 24:18.399
It was a flight over the region

24:18.400 --> 24:21.318
of the Atlantic Ocean known
as the Bermuda Triangle,

24:21.319 --> 24:23.112
during which Gernon claims

24:23.113 --> 24:27.534
to have experienced
an inexplicable shift in time.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.370
So, Bruce, uh, it was,

24:31.371 --> 24:34.748
it was 1970, and you were flying
out of Andros.

24:34.749 --> 24:36.417
Who-Who was with you
on this flight?

24:36.418 --> 24:39.545
Uh, my dad and our business
partner was with us,

24:39.546 --> 24:41.881
and it was a routine flight,
but, uh, this is the area

24:41.882 --> 24:45.926
where I, uh, took off
and started my ascent.

24:45.927 --> 24:47.889
I was at a thousand feet
just like we are right now.

24:48.889 --> 24:50.639
And I started climbing

24:50.640 --> 24:53.893
straight out over
that bank right there.

24:53.894 --> 24:57.271
- There it is.
- Is that it? Okay.

24:57.272 --> 24:58.857
I don't know,
it looks kinda eerie here.

25:00.901 --> 25:03.944
There's nothing much around,
is there?

25:03.945 --> 25:06.280
Very remote area
of the Bahama bank.

25:06.281 --> 25:07.740
Wow, what was that?

25:07.741 --> 25:09.325
Did you feel that?

25:09.326 --> 25:10.784
- Uh...
- There it is.

25:10.785 --> 25:13.412
Ah, that was the weirdest...
Can you catch that?

25:13.413 --> 25:14.747
Something we should maybe...

25:14.748 --> 25:17.124
Okay. It's out of control?

25:17.125 --> 25:19.460
It's okay, guys,
we just hit a rough spot.

25:19.461 --> 25:21.295
We've just got a little
turbulence here.

25:21.296 --> 25:23.088
It's turbulence.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.548
How about that? Yeah. Wow.

25:24.549 --> 25:26.133
I have to admit,
I'm actually glad

25:26.134 --> 25:27.927
that-that we didn't vanish.

25:27.928 --> 25:31.222
It's right
in this exact area here...

25:31.223 --> 25:32.806
where it did that.

25:32.807 --> 25:36.477
- Wow. Uh, a premonition, maybe.
- Kind of, yeah.

25:36.478 --> 25:38.562
All right, so you... did you
think that anything strange

25:38.563 --> 25:40.940
- was gonna happen to you that day?
- No, no.

25:40.941 --> 25:43.400
I had no premonitions,
but this strange cloud

25:43.401 --> 25:45.110
formed right in front of us,

25:45.111 --> 25:47.488
and it was like
a lenticular-shaped cloud.

25:47.489 --> 25:50.074
But it was just
sort of hovering there.

25:50.075 --> 25:52.619
And it did look
a little strange.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.747
As soon as I got over it,
it started expanding.

25:56.748 --> 26:01.126
And then before you know it,
I-I'm inside the cloud.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.504
And so now I can't see anything.

26:03.505 --> 26:06.507
Visibility was near zero.

26:06.508 --> 26:08.634
There was lightning in there.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.178
It was flashes of lightning.

26:11.179 --> 26:13.555
These flashes got more
and more intense

26:13.556 --> 26:15.140
the deeper we went in it.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.142
It got darker, too.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.395
It was almost like night
and day.

26:19.396 --> 26:22.356
My co-pilot, my dad, he said,

26:22.357 --> 26:25.442
uh, maybe we ought to turn
around and go back to Andros.

26:25.443 --> 26:28.153
I didn't want to turn around

26:28.154 --> 26:30.239
and go back through this cloud

26:30.240 --> 26:31.365
that was freaking me out,
you know?

26:31.366 --> 26:32.825
It would've been worse.

26:32.826 --> 26:34.868
There was no turning back,
you felt.

26:34.869 --> 26:38.038
I said to my dad,
"well, hold on, not yet."

26:38.039 --> 26:40.499
Rather than turning
back for land,

26:40.500 --> 26:42.501
Bruce decided to pull out
of the cloud

26:42.502 --> 26:44.211
that the plane
had become immersed in,

26:44.212 --> 26:47.715
and continued on
his flight path.

26:47.716 --> 26:50.634
But when he came out
of the cloud, he realized

26:50.635 --> 26:52.761
that the situation
was even more incredible

26:52.762 --> 26:54.471
than he first thought.

26:54.472 --> 26:57.141
His plane was surrounded
on all sides

26:57.142 --> 26:59.310
by a giant storm.

26:59.311 --> 27:01.979
And there appeared
to be no way out.

27:01.980 --> 27:05.691
I felt like we were trapped
inside this strange storm.

27:05.692 --> 27:08.902
And then I noticed a big tunnel

27:08.903 --> 27:13.615
about a mile wide
and ten miles long.

27:13.616 --> 27:15.784
So I said, "oh, well,
we'll go through that."

27:15.785 --> 27:17.202
My dad agreed.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.747
When we entered the tunnel,

27:19.748 --> 27:21.373
an incredible thing happened.

27:21.374 --> 27:25.878
A series of clouds
formed a swirling line

27:25.879 --> 27:28.380
that was slowly rotating
counterclockwise.

27:28.381 --> 27:30.424
It felt like we
were hydroplaning.

27:30.425 --> 27:32.676
Somehow we were at zero gravity.

27:32.677 --> 27:36.889
We were floating
and going forward somehow.

27:36.890 --> 27:40.559
And I came out of the tunnel,
I looked back behind

27:40.560 --> 27:42.687
and I watched
the tunnel collapse.

27:45.690 --> 27:48.192
The radar controller
comes back on the microphone,

27:48.193 --> 27:50.736
and he's-he's yelling
really loud.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.279
He's all excited. He says,

27:52.280 --> 27:54.782
"I got an airplane
directly over Miami Beach."

27:54.783 --> 27:56.992
So I look at my watch.

27:56.993 --> 27:59.995
"No, I got another 30 minutes
to go here.

27:59.996 --> 28:01.955
"Uh, I'm, uh,

28:01.956 --> 28:05.667
"at least 80 miles
east of you guys," I tell him.

28:05.668 --> 28:07.044
But then I look down,

28:07.045 --> 28:08.796
and there's Miami Beach
right below me.

28:08.797 --> 28:13.175
I traveled 100 miles
in only three minutes.

28:13.176 --> 28:16.053
100 miles?

28:16.054 --> 28:18.764
In three minutes?

28:18.765 --> 28:22.476
Bruce's plane would have
to have been traveling

28:22.477 --> 28:24.645
2,000 miles per hour

28:24.646 --> 28:28.774
to cross that distance
in such a short amount of time,

28:28.775 --> 28:31.276
a speed that his small plane

28:31.277 --> 28:34.947
was not even remotely
capable of.

28:34.948 --> 28:36.782
But the people on the plane,
they're...

28:36.783 --> 28:39.243
except for a little bit of mist
and fog around them, they're...

28:39.244 --> 28:41.537
they don't really notice
anything strange is happening.

28:41.538 --> 28:43.205
No, they didn't notice
anything strange.

28:43.206 --> 28:47.960
But, uh, all their watches
were set back 20 minutes.

28:47.961 --> 28:49.962
I believe now
that what was happening

28:49.963 --> 28:54.258
was I-I was seeing
the fabric of time.

28:54.259 --> 28:56.969
And I believe that is what

28:56.970 --> 28:59.931
creates the mystery
of the Bermuda Triangle.

29:01.099 --> 29:02.641
Could it be

29:02.642 --> 29:05.811
that the so-called tunnel
that Bruce describes

29:05.812 --> 29:09.314
was actually some type
of electromagnetic vortex,

29:09.315 --> 29:11.525
one that, like a black hole,

29:11.526 --> 29:14.528
could alter both time and space?

29:14.529 --> 29:17.322
For ancient astronaut theorists,

29:17.323 --> 29:21.326
the answer is a resounding
yes, and they argue

29:21.327 --> 29:23.495
that even more evidence
can be found

29:23.496 --> 29:26.081
by studying
ancient disappearances

29:26.082 --> 29:28.375
not only of individuals,

29:28.376 --> 29:32.130
but of an entire civilization.

29:35.553 --> 29:38.471
Easter Island.

29:38.472 --> 29:41.474
Located in the Pacific Ocean,

29:41.475 --> 29:45.311
over 2,000 miles
off the coast of Chile,

29:45.312 --> 29:49.315
this remote island was once home
to the Rapa Nui people,

29:49.316 --> 29:52.527
who, after flourishing
for hundreds of years,

29:52.528 --> 29:55.155
seemed to mysteriously disappear

29:55.156 --> 29:58.533
sometime in the 18th century.

29:58.534 --> 30:00.243
It seems, at some point,

30:00.244 --> 30:03.079
it may be as much
as 10,000 people

30:03.080 --> 30:04.664
lived there at its peak.

30:04.665 --> 30:07.333
But about 100 years later,

30:07.334 --> 30:10.587
when more Europeans started
showing up on a regular basis,

30:10.588 --> 30:14.090
it seemed to be down
to about 1,500 people.

30:14.091 --> 30:17.510
So something happened
at Easter Island

30:17.511 --> 30:20.598
to seriously decrease
their population.

30:22.558 --> 30:25.602
While mainstream
historians have long debated

30:25.603 --> 30:29.230
the cause of the mass
disappearance of the Rapa Nui,

30:29.231 --> 30:31.941
ancient astronaut theorists
believe

30:31.942 --> 30:35.695
it may have something to do
with Easter Island being located

30:35.696 --> 30:38.198
in one of the 12 areas
that were identified

30:38.199 --> 30:40.742
by cryptozoologist
Ivan T. Sanderson

30:40.743 --> 30:43.369
as "vile vortices,"

30:43.370 --> 30:47.457
places on Earth where
strange electromagnetic activity

30:47.458 --> 30:50.044
is more likely to occur.

30:52.421 --> 30:54.506
We know there are places
around the world

30:54.507 --> 30:57.592
that have an unknown energy.

30:57.593 --> 31:03.848
Easter Island, Egypt,
Indus Valley, Mexico.

31:03.849 --> 31:07.185
Also in Asia, in Tibet.

31:07.186 --> 31:09.896
All around the world
in these areas

31:09.897 --> 31:13.650
also there were built
megalithic structures.

31:13.651 --> 31:16.402
How we can explain that?

31:16.403 --> 31:20.448
The only possible explanation
is an ancient contact

31:20.449 --> 31:25.328
with sophisticated alien
civilizations around the world.

31:25.329 --> 31:29.165
The traditions of Rapa Nui are

31:29.166 --> 31:30.625
absolutely incredible,

31:30.626 --> 31:33.920
because their entire society
is based

31:33.921 --> 31:37.006
on this idea
that they were seeded

31:37.007 --> 31:40.593
by none other than the birdmen.

31:40.594 --> 31:43.513
So what were they describing?

31:43.514 --> 31:47.225
And so if you look at
this whole idea of the Rapa Nui,

31:47.226 --> 31:52.146
what if the stories
of the birdmen are nothing else

31:52.147 --> 31:54.691
but a description
of extraterrestrials

31:54.692 --> 31:57.944
that somehow were involved

31:57.945 --> 32:02.574
on the happenings that
were going on on Easter Island?

32:02.575 --> 32:07.453
Extraterrestrial groups
have been terraforming

32:07.454 --> 32:11.833
and harvesting genetic material
on this planet

32:11.834 --> 32:14.836
for more than 270 million years.

32:14.837 --> 32:18.047
Is that what Easter Island was,

32:18.048 --> 32:20.675
a genetic experiment?

32:20.676 --> 32:24.888
And maybe that's why
they were transferred out.

32:30.436 --> 32:33.187
Is it possible
that because Easter Island,

32:33.188 --> 32:36.441
like the Bermuda Triangle,
is located at a place

32:36.442 --> 32:39.235
of increased electromagnetic
activity

32:39.236 --> 32:44.490
that the area serves as a kind
of extraterrestrial portal,

32:44.491 --> 32:47.160
a gateway which, when opened,

32:47.161 --> 32:49.871
could allow alien beings
to come to Earth

32:49.872 --> 32:53.041
and humans
to travel back with them?

32:53.042 --> 32:56.502
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

32:56.503 --> 33:00.173
and suggest this phenomenon
might also happen

33:00.174 --> 33:03.302
in every country on Earth.

33:08.542 --> 33:14.547
Holland, Michigan,
February 18, 1978.

33:14.548 --> 33:19.135
Steven Kubacki,
a student at Hope College,

33:19.136 --> 33:22.847
tells his roommates he is going
out cross-country skiing.

33:22.848 --> 33:25.725
When Steven doesn't return
by nightfall,

33:25.726 --> 33:27.560
his roommates contact
the police,

33:27.561 --> 33:31.314
and a massive search and rescue
operation is launched.

33:35.527 --> 33:38.028
Two days later,
they find Steven's backpack

33:38.029 --> 33:40.489
and his skis
sitting on the beach

33:40.490 --> 33:42.742
to the Great Lakes.

33:42.743 --> 33:45.536
And they walk out
and they search the area,

33:45.537 --> 33:47.580
and they find tracks in the snow

33:47.581 --> 33:51.876
leading out onto the ice
towards the lake.

33:51.877 --> 33:54.920
The tracks appeared to stop
in the middle of the lake.

33:54.921 --> 33:57.006
There was no hole.
There was nothing.

33:57.007 --> 33:58.424
That was
just where they stopped.

33:58.425 --> 34:01.428
He completely disappeared.

34:04.639 --> 34:06.932
A little over a year later,

34:06.933 --> 34:09.185
Steven Kubacki awakens
in a field

34:09.186 --> 34:12.563
some 700 miles
from where he disappeared,

34:12.563 --> 34:16.317
certain it was the same day as
the one when he went missing.

34:16.318 --> 34:18.652
He had no memory of
where he had been,

34:18.652 --> 34:21.280
or how he had travelled
across the country.

34:21.281 --> 34:24.784
Where he was
for that one year and two months

34:24.784 --> 34:26.619
is a complete black hole.

34:26.620 --> 34:29.580
After months of investigation,

34:29.581 --> 34:32.917
there was no credible evidence
that Steven Kubacki had

34:32.918 --> 34:35.127
staged or faked
his disappearance.

34:35.128 --> 34:40.049
So how was it that a 23-year-old
skier suddenly vanished

34:40.050 --> 34:44.469
without a trace, only to return
just over a year later,

34:44.471 --> 34:48.058
and with no memory of where
he had gone or for how long?

34:50.018 --> 34:53.020
These are the questions
currently being answered

34:53.021 --> 34:54.813
by former police detective
turned missing persons

34:54.815 --> 34:59.151
investigator, Dave Paulides.

34:59.152 --> 35:01.237
This is Dave.

35:01.238 --> 35:03.072
For the past nine years,

35:03.073 --> 35:05.324
he has been investigating
the world's most baffling

35:05.325 --> 35:08.828
missing persons cases,
and has concluded

35:08.829 --> 35:10.538
that there are certain places
on Earth

35:10.539 --> 35:12.873
where unexplained
disappearances occur

35:12.874 --> 35:16.335
in astonishingly high numbers.

35:16.336 --> 35:17.753
I know a lot of people
throughout the world

35:17.754 --> 35:19.672
have heard of
the Bermuda Triangle...

35:19.673 --> 35:22.091
Missing ships and planes
over water.

35:22.092 --> 35:25.511
I don't think many people have
heard about the disappearances

35:25.512 --> 35:29.181
of people on land
that fit this exact profile

35:29.182 --> 35:30.683
that we've established.

35:30.684 --> 35:34.812
Certain profile points
replicate themselves

35:34.813 --> 35:36.856
time after time after time.

35:36.857 --> 35:38.691
When they bring in search dogs,
bloodhounds,

35:38.692 --> 35:41.068
they can't pick up a scent.

35:41.069 --> 35:43.237
They bring in
professional trackers.

35:43.238 --> 35:45.072
They can't track point to point.

35:45.073 --> 35:48.742
Many, many times, there's
a weather event in relationship

35:48.743 --> 35:50.203
to the disappearance.

35:52.205 --> 35:56.041
Other times, the person
disappears near a body of water,

35:56.042 --> 35:58.586
or is found near
a body of water.

35:58.587 --> 36:01.005
Other instances,
if the person is found,

36:01.006 --> 36:04.300
they're found in a location that
has been previously searched...

36:04.301 --> 36:07.177
Not just once,
maybe dozens of times.

36:07.178 --> 36:09.973
They leave the searchers
scratching their head.

36:12.726 --> 36:16.353
After examining thousands
of missing persons incidents,

36:16.354 --> 36:20.858
Dave Paulides has identified
59 so-called "hot spots"

36:20.859 --> 36:23.444
in the United States alone.

36:23.445 --> 36:26.405
Places where more people appear
to vanish...

36:26.406 --> 36:28.699
And without any signs
of foul play...

36:28.700 --> 36:31.493
Than anywhere else
in the country.

36:31.494 --> 36:33.245
In the work we do,
it-it's a rare event

36:33.246 --> 36:35.831
that you find somebody
who's alive.

36:35.832 --> 36:39.835
But in those instances, the
vast, vast majority of times,

36:39.836 --> 36:41.795
the victim doesn't remember
what happened.

36:41.796 --> 36:44.131
They don't know why
they got lost,

36:44.132 --> 36:45.633
they don't know where they went,

36:45.634 --> 36:46.942
they don't know where
they've been.

36:48.678 --> 36:51.847
I've been very fortunate to meet
some of the smartest people

36:51.848 --> 36:55.935
in the world
of theoretical physicists.

36:55.936 --> 36:58.771
And during those conversations,

36:58.772 --> 37:01.732
many times it's gone
towards portals.

37:01.733 --> 37:05.277
And the response coming back
from the physicists was

37:05.278 --> 37:08.740
these portals can be directed
and targeted.

37:11.326 --> 37:13.953
Is it possible that when
people go through

37:13.954 --> 37:16.288
these time-tunnel portals,

37:16.289 --> 37:19.792
and they have no memory
of what went on,

37:19.793 --> 37:23.170
it's because there's nothing
for them to have a memory of,

37:23.171 --> 37:26.006
because, for them, it was just
an instantaneous thing?

37:26.007 --> 37:27.967
So, I'm one of these people,

37:27.968 --> 37:31.178
as an investigator, that lives
in the world of facts.

37:31.179 --> 37:34.431
I don't hypothesize,
I don't theorize,

37:34.432 --> 37:37.017
and I'm very careful about
where I tread

37:37.018 --> 37:38.978
and who I talk to
about these things.

37:38.979 --> 37:42.356
And when you hear from
the scientist who's credible

37:42.357 --> 37:45.609
saying these things
could be occurring,

37:45.610 --> 37:47.361
it makes you uncomfortable,

37:47.362 --> 37:49.697
and it makes you wonder, really,
what might be going on.

37:49.698 --> 37:53.158
Could mankind be on the verge

37:53.159 --> 37:56.328
of an incredible breakthrough...

37:56.329 --> 37:59.415
One that acknowledges
that black holes exist

37:59.416 --> 38:04.336
not only in deep space,
but also here on Earth?

38:04.337 --> 38:07.756
For the answers,
ancient astronaut theorists

38:07.757 --> 38:10.009
point to additional research
being done,

38:10.010 --> 38:13.012
not out in space
or in a laboratory,

38:13.013 --> 38:16.474
but deep beneath
the Earth's oceans.

38:19.420 --> 38:22.756
September 3, 2013.

38:22.757 --> 38:27.135
Scientists from ETH Zurich
and the University of Miami

38:27.136 --> 38:30.430
publish an incredible report.

38:30.431 --> 38:33.308
According to their research,
they have discovered

38:33.309 --> 38:35.685
that many circular-shaped
ocean patterns,

38:35.686 --> 38:37.687
otherwise known as "eddies,"

38:37.688 --> 38:42.026
are the mathematical equivalent
of black holes in space.

38:43.820 --> 38:48.198
Mainstream scientists are now
forced to ask themselves...

38:48.199 --> 38:51.493
Have black holes been
on Earth all along,

38:51.494 --> 38:56.998
not only in the oceans,
but also on dry land?

38:56.999 --> 38:58.625
Some people will say,

38:58.626 --> 39:00.502
"Oh, we understand black holes
completely,"

39:00.503 --> 39:01.795
and that's nonsense.

39:01.796 --> 39:06.424
We're seeing in the universe
black hole candidates,

39:06.425 --> 39:08.969
and they're displaying
a range of behaviors

39:08.970 --> 39:12.305
which we hadn't anticipated.

39:12.306 --> 39:15.684
It turns out that when you look
at the mathematics of vortices,

39:15.685 --> 39:18.645
there's a certain universality...

39:18.646 --> 39:22.524
That we see them when you pull
the plug in your bathtub,

39:22.525 --> 39:26.194
you see them in hurricanes
and twisters.

39:26.195 --> 39:30.532
You see them as a universal
feature of nature.

39:30.533 --> 39:36.037
We are looking for solutions
to a unified

39:36.038 --> 39:38.039
electrodynamic space-time

39:38.040 --> 39:41.835
that will allow us
to open a portal...

39:41.836 --> 39:44.379
A vortex portal, perhaps...

39:44.380 --> 39:48.967
To another star system
that we can transit,

39:48.968 --> 39:52.387
and to do that with a far lower
threshold of energy

39:52.388 --> 39:56.224
than one would expect from
conventional black hole theory.

39:56.225 --> 40:01.187
But if, as scientists are now
beginning to discover,

40:01.188 --> 40:05.275
black holes can provide gateways
through time and distance

40:05.276 --> 40:09.404
not only in outer space,
but on our own planet,

40:09.405 --> 40:11.907
could they also be controlled?

40:11.908 --> 40:15.744
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

40:15.745 --> 40:19.414
the answer is a resounding yes.

40:19.415 --> 40:23.168
And they argue that Earth's
black holes have been controlled

40:23.169 --> 40:25.086
for thousands of years,

40:25.087 --> 40:28.382
and by beings that are not
of this world.

40:30.426 --> 40:34.930
We have to think of these vortex
areas around the Earth

40:34.931 --> 40:38.433
as something that is useful...

40:38.434 --> 40:40.393
That if extraterrestrials
and other people

40:40.394 --> 40:42.729
can manipulate
these vortex areas,

40:42.730 --> 40:45.607
that we could do that, too.

40:45.608 --> 40:47.442
Physicists are always
talking about

40:47.443 --> 40:50.111
our strange
and beautiful universe.

40:50.112 --> 40:53.156
But our Earth is pretty strange
and beautiful, too.

40:53.157 --> 40:57.452
And maybe these black holes on
Earth are going to be the key

40:57.453 --> 41:00.956
to open up the gateways
to the universe for us.

41:00.957 --> 41:03.249
This is the stuff
of science fiction.

41:03.250 --> 41:05.919
But it's actually the border
between science fact

41:05.920 --> 41:07.420
and science fiction.

41:07.421 --> 41:11.676
And these are things that cannot
be ruled out.

41:13.636 --> 41:15.136
Will the realization

41:15.137 --> 41:17.973
that black holes exist
here on Earth

41:17.974 --> 41:19.516
help to resolve
some of history's

41:19.517 --> 41:22.143
most unanswered questions...

41:22.144 --> 41:26.481
Questions concerning not only
mysterious disappearances,

41:26.482 --> 41:31.611
but also those involving
extraterrestrial visitation?

41:31.612 --> 41:34.739
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

41:34.740 --> 41:38.493
and suggest that mankind is
standing on the threshold

41:38.494 --> 41:40.912
of an exciting future.

41:40.913 --> 41:44.332
One where dreams of traveling
through time and space

41:44.333 --> 41:46.042
will become reality,

41:46.043 --> 41:50.296
and where contact with our
alien ancestors will unlock

41:50.297 --> 41:53.174
the mysteries about
our ancient past.
