00:28.029 --> 00:30.029
Christmas decorations
are getting

00:30.031 --> 00:33.532
More lifelike every year,
charlie brown.

00:36.003 --> 00:39.204
I thought your little brother,
rerun, was coming with you?

00:39.206 --> 00:42.541
Our mom decided to take him
with her on her bicycle

00:42.543 --> 00:45.310
To do some christmas shopping.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.046
Pedal hard, mom.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.481
Harder. That's the way.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.850
Look out for the lawn mower.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.153
Great, we're out of the garage.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.723
When it comes to riding
on the back of mom's bicycle

00:57.725 --> 01:01.493
I'm a white-knuckle flier.
Look out for the tree.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.529
Look out for the fence.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.998
 Jingle bells 

01:06.000 --> 01:07.232
Look out!

01:07.234 --> 01:08.500
 Jingle bells 

01:08.502 --> 01:10.202
Aah, look out!

01:10.204 --> 01:12.704
 Jingle all the way 

01:12.706 --> 01:16.175
Singing doesn't help at all.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.344
Those bike rides
always wipe me out.

01:19.346 --> 01:22.414
I've got to find
some way to relax.

01:26.087 --> 01:29.021
Could you ask your dog
to come out and play?

01:29.023 --> 01:30.689
He's resting.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.025
Go find something else to do.

01:33.027 --> 01:35.227
Go home and read a book.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.429
I can't do that.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.931
Well, that's too bad.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.034
Find something
you know how to do.

01:42.036 --> 01:45.270
Well,
I know how to play with a dog.

02:04.725 --> 02:08.594
Someone at school today asked me
if I had an older brother

02:08.596 --> 02:10.795
Who dragged a blanket around.

02:10.798 --> 02:14.066
"no," I replied.
"I'm an only child."

02:14.068 --> 02:17.936
Then someone said, "but don't
you have a weird older sister?"

02:17.938 --> 02:21.740
"no," I insisted.
"I'm an only child."

02:21.742 --> 02:24.409
And so I go, day after day,

02:24.411 --> 02:27.946
Dodging questions
from curious outsiders.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.648
What else did they say?

02:29.650 --> 02:32.151
Some of the guys
over at the playground

02:32.153 --> 02:34.753
Were discussing crabby sisters.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.989
Guess what, I won.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.258
They all agree that I have

02:39.260 --> 02:41.426
The crabbiest sister
in the neighborhood.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.929
I'm a celebrity.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.933
You think I'm crabby now?
Wait until I'm 40 or 50.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.335
What about when you're 90?

02:50.337 --> 02:53.105
Then I'll be real nice.

02:53.107 --> 02:56.108
The trouble with being
a little kid

02:56.110 --> 03:00.812
Is no one ever asks your opinion
about anything.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.682
Why don't you stop talking
and just go to bed?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.351
Are you asking for my opinion?

03:07.655 --> 03:09.688
What are you writing, rerun?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.124
This is how I have it figured.

03:12.126 --> 03:15.127
If there are three kids
in a family,

03:15.129 --> 03:18.330
Each kid has 33
and a third rights.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.165
Wrong, little brother.

03:20.167 --> 03:24.503
It's 90 percent for me
and 5 percent for you.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.972
And 5 percent for you.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.841
I better check
those figures again.

03:29.843 --> 03:34.179
We're a family. And in a family,
each person has a job.

03:34.181 --> 03:37.382
Here, write down what you think
your job could be.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.018
How do you spell "watching"?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.353
Watching?

03:41.355 --> 03:43.922
That'll be my job, watching tv.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.393
Remember, rerun,
having an older sister

03:48.395 --> 03:51.396
Is like having a compass
to guide you through life.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.165
Is that true?

03:53.167 --> 03:55.701
I'm not here.

03:55.703 --> 03:59.371
How can I be expected
to live in the same house

03:59.373 --> 04:02.708
With two brothers?

04:02.710 --> 04:05.677
What kind of question was that?

04:05.679 --> 04:09.915
Big sisters are the crabgrass
in the lawn of life.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.684
I'm your younger brother

04:12.686 --> 04:14.186
And I don't suck my thumb,

04:14.188 --> 04:17.522
And I don't cling to a blanket
for security.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.190
Hooray for you.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.026
As the years go by,

04:21.028 --> 04:25.364
You'll probably develop
a real resentment toward me.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.934
And you'll find different ways
to get even.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.538
What would you do
if I kicked those over?

04:33.540 --> 04:35.874
Probably nothing at the moment.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.577
But years from now,
after you're married,

04:38.579 --> 04:41.413
And you and your husband
want me to cosign a note

04:41.415 --> 04:45.384
So you can buy a new house,
I'll refuse.

04:47.054 --> 04:51.290
Younger brothers
learn to think fast.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.461
If you're the third child
in a family

04:56.463 --> 04:59.898
And your brother and sister
are really weird,

04:59.900 --> 05:02.768
I wonder if it's possible
for that third child

05:02.770 --> 05:04.436
To develop an immunity.

05:04.438 --> 05:08.273
An immunity to all the bad
things that happen in a family.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.643
To that innocent third child
who might...

05:14.948 --> 05:17.916
Rerun:
So much for immunity.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.991
Wow, what a project.

05:25.993 --> 05:30.462
Color these pictures,
cut and paste, draw those trees.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.764
More cutting, more pasting.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.766
What a learning experience.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.670
Yes, ma'am,
you've done it again.

05:40.607 --> 05:44.943
When she's happy, we're happy.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.180
What are those round things?

05:48.182 --> 05:50.015
People faces.

05:50.017 --> 05:55.620
I'm drawing a football stadium
filled with 60,000 fans.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.323
I only see 10.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.325
Parking was a problem.

06:00.327 --> 06:04.162
We're supposed to draw
each other's face.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.864
Well, turn your head.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.167
I can only draw
a side-view face.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.636
I'm trying to have an expression

06:11.638 --> 06:15.474
Of someone looking to the future
with hope.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.276
That's all right, I'm just
drawing your ear.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.649
I'm tired of all this
kindergarten stuff.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.352
Why don't we run away to paris?

06:27.354 --> 06:29.488
If we got on a plane
at midnight,

06:29.490 --> 06:31.723
We could be in paris tomorrow.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.825
Do you have any money?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.394
I have 50 cents.

06:35.396 --> 06:39.431
Maybe we can get upgraded
to business class.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.834
There's this cute little girl

06:42.836 --> 06:45.670
Who sits next to me
in kindergarten.

06:45.672 --> 06:49.674
I told her maybe she and I
can go to paris someday.

06:49.676 --> 06:53.245
I don't even know
where paris is.

06:56.717 --> 07:00.852
The teacher says that
the principal wants to see you.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.854
Me?

07:05.225 --> 07:08.593
Yes, ma'am. I was told
the principal wants to see me.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.364
Why me? I'm nobody.

07:12.366 --> 07:15.367
I don't even have a dog.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.238
Yes, sir, mr. Principal.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.544
Who? The little girl
with the braids?

07:25.546 --> 07:29.214
Sure. We're in the same
kindergarten class.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.385
Did I ask her to go to paris?

07:33.387 --> 07:37.722
Well, sure, but that was
just a joke. I mean, how...?

07:39.393 --> 07:41.226
Harassment?

07:47.768 --> 07:49.234
Lucy:
Who's there?

07:49.236 --> 07:51.570
It's only me. I'm home early.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.705
I've been fired.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.244
This little girl in my class
was sort of depressed.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.414
So I said, "why don't we
run away to paris?"

08:02.416 --> 08:03.982
It was a joke.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.584
She thought it was funny

08:05.586 --> 08:08.253
So she told her mother,
who told the teacher,

08:08.255 --> 08:11.156
Who told the principal,
and I got fired.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.658
Suspended.
I guess so.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.461
Harassment?
Stupidity.

08:16.463 --> 08:20.332
Thank goodness christmas
vacation starts tomorrow.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.509
Mom should really let us
have a dog.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.255
Having a dog could be fun.
Don't you think?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.358
What are you doing?

08:46.360 --> 08:48.860
I'm writing a letter
to santa claus.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.462
Forget it, rerun.

08:50.464 --> 08:53.031
He doesn't have time
to read all those letters.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.468
I mean, he stands on the corner
all day ringing that bell.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.470
When he gets home, he's tired.

08:58.472 --> 09:01.406
He doesn't want to read
a bunch of whiny letters.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.509
Tell him lucy says hi.

09:04.511 --> 09:08.146
Which should I ask for,
a bicycle or a dog?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.848
I think maybe a dog.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.484
You can't fall off a dog.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.386
When santa claus
brings me the dog

09:14.388 --> 09:18.356
Will he leave it on the front
porch or in the backyard?

09:18.358 --> 09:20.692
He wouldn't drop it down
the chimney, would he?

09:20.694 --> 09:23.828
There's something I sort of feel
I should tell you.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.531
Maybe he'll just leave me
a gift certificate.

09:26.533 --> 09:30.335
Listen to me. Mom doesn't want
you to have a dog, does she?

09:30.337 --> 09:32.904
No.
Do you really think santa claus

09:32.906 --> 09:36.007
Is going to bring you something
mom doesn't want you to have?

09:36.009 --> 09:40.245
Ooh, supreme court stuff.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.186
Yes, sir, my name is rerun.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.423
Did you know that santa claus
is gonna bring me a dog?

09:51.425 --> 09:55.193
So what I need is a leash
and a collar and a supper dish.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.096
And you can just put it
on my tab.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.035
Who am I kidding, snoopy?

10:04.037 --> 10:05.370
Lucy is right.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.239
Santa claus is never gonna bring
a dog to someone

10:08.241 --> 10:10.709
Whose mom doesn't want him
to have a dog.

10:10.711 --> 10:14.679
If I'm lucky, I'll get a pair
of socks and an orange.

10:19.419 --> 10:23.288
Mom put the sandbox
in the garage for a while.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.759
Okay, rerun, out.
But...

10:27.761 --> 10:29.794
Sally and I wanna play
in the sandbox.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.229
But...

10:31.231 --> 10:34.299
There's not room for all of us,
so you'll have to leave.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.267
But...
There's two of us

10:36.269 --> 10:38.637
And there's only one of you.

10:46.146 --> 10:50.482
Oh, no, it's b-of-the-b day.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.717
Oh, no.

10:54.655 --> 10:57.322
What is b-of-the-b day?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.591
It's back-of-the-bike day.

10:59.593 --> 11:02.894
Rerun has to ride
on the back of mom's bike.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.499
I like they way
your mom handles that bike.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.669
See how she went through that
hedge instead of the brick wall?

11:10.671 --> 11:14.673
Yes, I must admit her steering
is getting a little better.

11:14.675 --> 11:19.177
Yesterday, we only hit four
parked cars.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.981
 Over hill, over dale 

11:22.983 --> 11:25.950
Poor dale.

11:25.952 --> 11:29.688
Riding around all day on the
back of your mom's bicycle

11:29.690 --> 11:32.791
Gives you plenty of time
to think.

11:32.793 --> 11:36.861
It gives you time to think about
people and about life.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.464
And about what would happen

11:39.466 --> 11:43.301
If we ran into a tree.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.670
We're going to the cleaners.

11:45.672 --> 11:49.541
Mom always likes to return
the used coat hangers.

11:49.543 --> 11:53.311
She hates it when I do this.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.048
This is the part of the ride
that I hate.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.652
Every day,
this big stupid german shepherd

12:00.654 --> 12:04.055
Comes running out
and chases our bicycle.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.692
He doesn't quit
until I throw my shoe at him.

12:07.694 --> 12:11.663
I'm running out of shoes.

12:11.665 --> 12:15.400
Riding on the back of your
mother's bicycle in the winter

12:15.402 --> 12:17.902
Can be a real experience.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.139
We can't see where we're going,
and we slide all over.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.510
Now it's a shopping cart
in the supermarket.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.012
Now it's a stroller
through the mall.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.014
And then back on the bicycle.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.350
Sometimes I go a whole day

12:32.352 --> 12:35.420
Without ever touching
the ground.

12:43.697 --> 12:46.865
You know something, schroeder?
What?

12:46.867 --> 12:50.568
I liked you the very first time
I saw you.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.873
I disliked you the first time
I saw you.

12:54.875 --> 12:59.611
It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.882
I have a historical question
for you.

13:03.884 --> 13:07.385
Did beethoven ever have
any beautiful girls nearby

13:07.387 --> 13:09.587
While he was practicing
the piano?

13:09.589 --> 13:13.057
No, I don't think beethoven
had any crabby females

13:13.059 --> 13:14.559
Hanging on his piano

13:14.561 --> 13:16.728
While he was trying to practice.

13:16.730 --> 13:20.131
That isn't quite what I said.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.466
Here's something.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.401
"a piano can strike notes

13:23.403 --> 13:26.070
"through a range
of seven octaves.

13:26.072 --> 13:29.140
"in comparison,
a child's toy piano

13:29.142 --> 13:31.442
"has a range of only one octave

13:31.444 --> 13:33.478
"and is virtually useless

13:33.480 --> 13:36.281
As a musical instrument
because of that."

13:43.423 --> 13:45.256
What else does it say?

13:45.258 --> 13:48.059
Never fall in love
with a musician.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.797
What do you two want?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.733
Good grief.

14:19.326 --> 14:23.294
Why can't I have a normal dog
like everyone else?

14:23.296 --> 14:26.631
But you're lucky to have a dog,
charlie brown.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.800
Does snoopy have any sisters?

14:28.802 --> 14:31.636
He has a sister, belle,
who lives in kansas city.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.538
Does snoopy have any brothers?

14:33.540 --> 14:36.374
One day, one of his brothers
named marbles

14:36.376 --> 14:38.009
Showed up out of the blue.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.845
But he only stayed one day.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.313
Rerun:
<i>Why was that?</i>

14:42.315 --> 14:45.049
Charlie:
<i>Well,</i>
<i>he had kind of a wild ride.</i>

15:01.668 --> 15:03.067
Here.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.170
Rerun: Who are they?
Charlie: That's andy and olaf,

15:06.172 --> 15:08.072
Two more brothers of snoopy.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.845
Charlie:
<i>They showed up and spent</i>
<i>a few days with snoopy.</i>

15:23.390 --> 15:25.189
<i>And then snoopy suggested</i>

15:25.191 --> 15:28.593
<i>They go visit
his other brother, spike.</i>

15:30.230 --> 15:31.729
This is spike.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.699
He lives in the desert.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.268
So, what happened?

15:37.270 --> 15:40.872
Charlie:
<i>They got lost</i>
<i>and ended up in alaska</i>

15:40.874 --> 15:44.442
<i>As sled dogs for a while.</i>

15:44.444 --> 15:47.111
Snoopy has the greatest family.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.047
If not the strangest.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.916
I wish one of them
could be my dog,

15:51.918 --> 15:54.052
But my mom doesn't want one.

15:54.054 --> 15:58.056
But would it be okay
if I play with snoopy sometimes?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.391
If your mom doesn't mind, sure.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.962
That would make this
the best christmas ever.

16:12.572 --> 16:16.074
I guess I'll try to play
by myself.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.575
Here we go.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.345
Slam dunk.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.883
Lot's of slam, but no dunk.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.594
Could you ask your dog
if he wants to come out

16:36.596 --> 16:38.997
And shoot a few baskets?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.666
I'll see if I can find him.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.185
I couldn't find him.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.989
But I doubt if he would have
been interested.

17:04.991 --> 17:08.326
Can you ask your dog if he wants
to come out and play?

17:08.328 --> 17:09.827
And then afterwards,

17:09.829 --> 17:13.164
I'll give him a christmas cookie
with sprinkles.

17:19.638 --> 17:22.205
Happiness is a warm puppy.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.120
I guess dogs have to eat a lot.

17:42.028 --> 17:45.063
How does he do that?

17:45.065 --> 17:48.332
By the way,
when somebody walks by,

17:48.334 --> 17:52.270
How do you decide
if you should bark at him?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.011
This is how it works.

18:00.013 --> 18:03.681
I'll take my cards
and you'll take your cards

18:03.683 --> 18:06.851
And then we'll throw them
in the air.

18:06.853 --> 18:12.123
Whoever has the most cards
land face up wins.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.363
How do you do that?

18:21.201 --> 18:25.937
Can you ask your dog to come out
and play chase the stick?

18:28.875 --> 18:31.609
"thank you for your offer
to come out and play.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.212
"we are busy at this time,
however,

18:34.214 --> 18:36.414
"and cannot accept your offer.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.951
We hope you will be successful
elsewhere."

18:39.953 --> 18:43.955
Dogs have rejection slips?

18:47.727 --> 18:51.229
Ask your dog if he wants
to come out and frolic.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.799
Yesterday, you asked him if he
wanted to come out and play.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.235
We're upgrading
the neighborhood.

18:57.237 --> 19:01.572
So then ask your dog to come out
and romp in the snow.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.642
Romp?
To "romp" means to play

19:04.644 --> 19:08.513
Or to frolic in a lively way.

19:10.150 --> 19:15.586
He said no. "no" means to deny
or refuse or disagree.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.789
I know what it means.

19:18.791 --> 19:22.426
Gee, mom, dogs are so much fun.

19:22.428 --> 19:25.429
Can we please get one
for christmas?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.100
Why, mom?

19:41.814 --> 19:45.950
I was wondering if you'd be
willing to sell your dog.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.952
How much money do you have?

19:47.954 --> 19:52.456
Here, you tell me. I don't know
anything about money.

19:52.458 --> 19:56.827
Well, you have a dime,
a nickel and a penny.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.996
You have 16 cents.

19:58.998 --> 20:03.234
Is that enough?
No. You'd need $10 million.

20:05.004 --> 20:10.541
How would it be if I gave you
16 cents now and the rest later?

20:13.146 --> 20:15.513
There's only one thing
left to do.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.516
It's time to see santa claus.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.352
Hey, big sister, wait a minute.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.055
I need you to take me
to santa claus.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.323
Why?

20:25.325 --> 20:28.326
I have something really
important to ask him.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.329
I'm very busy today.
Maybe tomorrow.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.179
Did beethoven ever buy
his girlfriend

20:48.181 --> 20:50.014
Fuzzy mittens for christmas?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.382
I doubt it.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.685
Here's your chance
to do something he never did.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.922
I've already thought of
doing something he never did.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.165
Did beethoven ever play
"jingle bells"?

21:09.702 --> 21:13.504
He probably thought he was too
good to play "jingle bells."

22:12.832 --> 22:16.167
I have my list for christmas.

22:16.169 --> 22:19.170
Well, a bicycle would be nice.

22:19.172 --> 22:23.240
And maybe a new sled
and a pair of in-line skates.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.844
And maybe a new jump rope.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.357
How did things go
with santa claus?

22:39.359 --> 22:42.460
It's nice to tell him what you
want for christmas, isn't it?

22:42.462 --> 22:45.896
If you can get past
his secretary.

22:50.670 --> 22:54.038
Wait here a second.
I have to check out this santa.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.343
Okay.
If you're a real santa claus,

22:59.345 --> 23:01.812
Where are your reindeer, huh?

23:01.814 --> 23:04.815
How are you gonna land
on all those rooftops

23:04.817 --> 23:07.351
And go down all those chimneys?

23:07.353 --> 23:09.487
And after you go down a chimney,

23:09.489 --> 23:12.323
How are you gonna get back up,
huh?

23:12.325 --> 23:14.658
I'll give you
about three houses,

23:14.660 --> 23:18.229
And you'll be completely
exhausted.

23:22.735 --> 23:26.404
I thought you might like a snack
while you were working.

23:30.042 --> 23:34.245
Hey, look, ma, santa is eating
out of a dog dish.

23:34.247 --> 23:38.582
As your big sister, I feel
that it is my duty to tell you

23:38.584 --> 23:42.920
That who you are about to see
is not the real santa claus.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.855
I don't care who he is

23:44.857 --> 23:48.192
As long as he can give me
a dog for christmas.

23:48.194 --> 23:51.862
What you're looking at
is a dog in a santa claus suit.

23:51.864 --> 23:55.065
Now that I've told you,
how does it make you feel?

23:55.067 --> 23:57.868
I like him.

23:57.870 --> 24:01.939
Santa, all I want for christmas
is a puppy dog.

24:03.376 --> 24:05.376
What does he want?

24:05.378 --> 24:08.512
I think he wants a contribution
to his box there.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.253
What did he say?

24:16.255 --> 24:20.090
He said, "thank you, the money
is for a worthy cause."

24:20.092 --> 24:21.759
And "merry christmas."

24:21.761 --> 24:23.894
And "say hello to the stupid kid

24:23.896 --> 24:26.897
With the blanket
and his crabby sister."

24:26.899 --> 24:30.734
Just forget it. Mom will never
let you have a dog, anyway.

24:30.736 --> 24:33.737
Everybody in the world
has a dog.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.806
Why can't I have a dog?

24:35.808 --> 24:38.409
You wouldn't know
how to take care of a dog.

24:38.411 --> 24:41.312
You wouldn't even know
how to feed it.

24:42.748 --> 24:45.483
Dogs like cold cereal.

24:46.819 --> 24:51.589
I don't know if I can
count on santa for a dog.

24:51.591 --> 24:55.659
If I eat all my dinner,
can I have a dog for christmas?

24:57.430 --> 25:00.097
Everybody in the world
has a dog.

25:00.099 --> 25:03.167
Why won't mom let me have one?

25:03.169 --> 25:06.136
A lot of people in the world
don't have dogs.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.005
They can be a lot of trouble.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.840
What I think I'll do today

25:09.842 --> 25:13.344
Is take some money
out of my college trust fund

25:13.346 --> 25:14.979
And go buy a dog.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.615
You don't have
a college trust fund.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.951
I don't? Good grief.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.487
Please pass the grape jelly.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.489
We're all out of grape jelly.

25:25.491 --> 25:31.362
How could anyone not have a dog
or a trust fund or grape jelly?

25:31.364 --> 25:34.198
If you don't think dogs
are a lot of trouble

25:34.200 --> 25:38.135
Just ask charlie brown
about his stupid dog.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.972
My mom and sister say
that dogs are a lot of trouble.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.808
Owning a dog
is a big responsibility, rerun.

25:44.810 --> 25:47.878
They need lots of care.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.248
And they need
a lot of comforting.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.552
Maybe if I watch you and snoopy,

25:54.554 --> 25:56.854
I'll know how to take care
of a dog

25:56.856 --> 25:58.722
If I get one from santa.

26:10.670 --> 26:16.173
How can you tell
which boot goes on which foot?

26:16.175 --> 26:21.178
I hate zippers. Oh, how I hate
zippers and mittens.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.747
How can you tell
where the thumbs go?

26:23.749 --> 26:27.685
I wasn't made for winter.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.897
What's going on here?

26:39.899 --> 26:42.366
I'm going christmas shopping.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.269
This was the cheapest ticket
I could get.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.705
What's happening, charlie brown?

26:47.707 --> 26:49.940
I haven't the slightest idea.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.210
What kind of an airplane
is this?

26:53.212 --> 26:57.047
Where's the complimentary
orange juice?

26:57.049 --> 27:00.951
And isn't anyone
going to welcome me aboard?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.455
Blech!

27:04.457 --> 27:06.890
I'd rather have
the orange juice.

27:06.892 --> 27:10.894
It's been a smooth flight
so far, hasn't it?

27:10.896 --> 27:14.465
Almost like we're not
flying at all.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.135
Stupid pilot.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.905
What happens if there's a loss
of cabin pressure?

27:21.907 --> 27:27.378
Where are the oxygen masks
in case there's an emergency?

27:31.117 --> 27:36.987
Hey, I thought that passengers
were always served a nice lunch.

27:39.625 --> 27:42.660
What happens
when we get to the ocean?

27:42.662 --> 27:46.664
Do you have special equipment
for flying over water?

27:51.837 --> 27:56.006
Hey, I'm getting cold and wet.
Take me back home.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.148
So much for christmas shopping.

28:04.150 --> 28:09.119
Charlie brown, you have the
greatest dog in all the world.

28:09.121 --> 28:14.058
Now I've just got to find a way
to get me a dog for christmas.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.529
This letter came for you today.

28:24.704 --> 28:27.471
It's a letter to snoopy
from his brother, spike,

28:27.473 --> 28:29.640
The one who lives in the desert.

28:35.381 --> 28:39.316
Charlie:
<i>For my christmas tree,</i>
<i>I decorated a tumbleweed.</i>

28:39.318 --> 28:43.053
<i>It looked really beautiful.</i>

28:43.055 --> 28:45.222
<i>But then it left.</i>

29:03.175 --> 29:05.542
"we had some cold mornings here
in the desert.

29:05.544 --> 29:09.346
<i>Today, I actually had a fire
in my fireplace.</i>

29:09.348 --> 29:11.749
<i>It even started to snow.</i>

29:28.701 --> 29:32.302
Charlie:
<i>I had fun stringing</i>
<i>the christmas tree lights.</i>

29:36.242 --> 29:38.442
<i>Up to a point.</i>

29:41.046 --> 29:43.547
Does spike live all alone
in the desert?

29:43.549 --> 29:47.417
Yes, he does. It's probably
a very lonely life.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.253
Here's what I've been thinking.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.622
He could use a better home,
couldn't he?

29:51.624 --> 29:55.692
Sure he could.
So here's my idea...

29:57.563 --> 30:00.130
Can you send a letter for me?

30:05.404 --> 30:07.905
Please write to your brother
in the desert.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.240
Tell him he can be my dog.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.075
Tell him we'll be pals.

30:12.077 --> 30:17.080
He can chase sticks and pull me
in my wagon and learn tricks.

30:17.082 --> 30:19.650
And we'll celebrate christmas
together.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.925
Merry christmas, schroeder.
Thank you.

30:27.927 --> 30:30.594
I just noticed something
about this room.

30:30.596 --> 30:31.962
What's that?

30:31.964 --> 30:34.998
There's an appalling lack
of mistletoe.

30:41.607 --> 30:44.341
Beethoven was a bad influence.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.310
How can you say that?

30:46.312 --> 30:48.946
Lots of musicians
never get married

30:48.948 --> 30:51.648
Just because beethoven
never got married.

30:51.650 --> 30:55.185
That's what I call
a bad influence.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.790
Where's rerun?

30:59.792 --> 31:03.460
He's outside building a snowman
to greet spike.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.325
Please don't melt my snowman.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.227
Don't. Please don't.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.163
It's for my new dog, spike.

31:40.165 --> 31:44.401
Please. Please stop.
Don't do it.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.869
Rats.

31:45.871 --> 31:50.240
You can talk to the moon,
but the sun won't listen.

31:51.844 --> 31:56.680
Look, rerun. It's a postcard for
snoopy from his brother, spike.

31:56.682 --> 31:57.881
"dear snoopy.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.183
"my friend and I are making
a painful journey

32:00.185 --> 32:02.519
Across the country to see you."
oh, ha, ha!

32:02.521 --> 32:04.521
Painful?
Why would the trip be painful?

32:04.523 --> 32:07.057
And who's the friend
he's bringing?

32:11.196 --> 32:14.731
I'm so excited
that your brother's coming.

32:14.733 --> 32:18.235
This will be the best christmas
I've ever had.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.870
You're crazy, rerun.

32:19.872 --> 32:22.205
Mom will never let you
have a dog.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.107
Besides, how in the world

32:24.109 --> 32:26.209
Will he ever be able
to find you?

32:26.211 --> 32:28.211
Dogs are very smart.

32:28.213 --> 32:30.580
They can find their way
anyplace.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.116
They always know where they are.

32:37.957 --> 32:42.125
I don't believe it.
He actually found us.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.628
Look, there's spike, rerun.

32:51.603 --> 32:56.073
Spike, good grief.
You're as thin as a promise.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.442
This is the most
miserable-looking dog

32:58.444 --> 32:59.943
I've ever seen.

32:59.945 --> 33:03.146
I'm gonna take him home
and feed him.

33:05.751 --> 33:09.086
Hey, that's my blanket
he's wearing.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.487
Hospital robe.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.155
What's that?

33:12.157 --> 33:15.592
This is a milk shake for spike.
I'm fattening him up.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.494
I'm your brother.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.797
How come you never
make me a milk shake?

33:20.799 --> 33:25.502
When he's through,
you can lick the straw.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.338
You thought I couldn't do it,
didn't you?

33:28.340 --> 33:29.473
Do what?

33:29.475 --> 33:31.942
Well,
spike isn't skinny anymore.

33:31.944 --> 33:33.844
I got him back in shape.

33:33.846 --> 33:35.612
Come on out, spike.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.881
Show everybody
how great you look.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.488
How's rerun doing
with the fat spike?

33:44.490 --> 33:47.724
He's trying to teach him
some games.

33:50.996 --> 33:54.331
That looks like a good game.
What do you call it?

33:54.333 --> 33:56.833
Slobber ball.

33:56.835 --> 33:59.836
Okay. You put down a nine,

33:59.838 --> 34:03.573
So I'll put down a 10.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.214
Okay. You put down a jack,

34:11.216 --> 34:14.717
So I'll put down a queen.

34:20.859 --> 34:23.659
What kind of game
are you guys playing?

34:23.661 --> 34:27.063
We don't have
the slightest idea.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.536
Now what are you doing?

34:32.538 --> 34:34.404
It's a jigsaw puzzle.

34:34.406 --> 34:38.742
If the pieces don't fit,
we make them fit.

34:47.219 --> 34:50.687
A tooth.
I've lost another tooth.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.856
I must be getting old.

34:52.858 --> 34:56.860
Next, I'll start losing my hair.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.863
But I don't wanna go
on the bike.

34:59.865 --> 35:02.599
Mom wants you to help
pick out a christmas tree.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.702
But I don't wanna leave spike.

35:05.704 --> 35:09.573
Here you are, rerun.
Spike will keep you company.

35:12.077 --> 35:13.944
Look out for the tree.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.879
Look out for the truck.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.747
Look out for the fence.

35:19.218 --> 35:24.221
I hate looking at the world
through my fingers.

35:24.223 --> 35:28.425
Well, spike has lost
all that weight I put on him.

35:28.427 --> 35:31.061
It must have been the bike ride.

35:31.063 --> 35:34.731
Anyway, mom says we can't
keep spike anymore.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.233
She just felt sorry for him

35:36.235 --> 35:38.568
Because he looked so bad
when he got here.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.804
So, what's going to happen
to him?

35:40.806 --> 35:44.074
Don't worry, charlie brown
will find a nice home for him.

35:44.076 --> 35:47.611
You're asking our family
to adopt this dog?

35:47.613 --> 35:51.748
Why not? He's snoopy's
big brother. He's a good dog.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.950
He's a full-blooded beagle.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.952
That's what you say.

35:55.954 --> 35:59.656
I say he's part beagle
and part disaster.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.092
He's been living
just outside of needles

36:02.094 --> 36:03.960
With a bunch of coyotes.

36:03.962 --> 36:07.497
I think I'd rather have
one of the coyotes.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.006
Wouldn't you like to own
a good watchdog?

36:16.008 --> 36:19.109
Isn't this the sort of dog
you'd like to have with you

36:19.111 --> 36:21.444
If you had some place to go
at night?

36:21.446 --> 36:25.549
I sure wouldn't want to be seen
in the daylight with him.

36:28.020 --> 36:31.988
I'm sorry, charlie brown.
Beethoven never owned a dog.

36:31.990 --> 36:36.026
If beethoven never owned a dog,
I guess I shouldn't either.

36:37.196 --> 36:40.330
Beethoven would have liked
this dog.

36:40.332 --> 36:41.698
Well, spike,

36:41.700 --> 36:44.301
I'm sorry we couldn't find
a home for you here,

36:44.303 --> 36:46.636
But maybe you're better off
in the desert anyway.

37:00.185 --> 37:04.988
Goodbye, spike.
I'll really, really miss you.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.557
Don't forget to write.

37:12.164 --> 37:15.165
Rerun:
<i>I sure hope he gets a ride</i>
<i>this time.</i>

37:15.167 --> 37:17.567
Charlie:
<i>I hope so too.</i>

37:38.590 --> 37:43.260
Little brother, I realize how
upset you must be losing spike.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.395
So to make you forget about him,

37:45.397 --> 37:48.431
I've signed you up
to be in our christmas play.

37:48.433 --> 37:51.034
Here's the script.
Just memorize it.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.936
I can't memorize.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.105
Don't worry,
you only have one line.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.040
I'll help you.

37:57.042 --> 38:00.377
We are here to tell you
of a wondrous light.

38:00.379 --> 38:03.780
A wondrous light
that was a star.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.217
I wonder if there's any way
I can get out of here.

38:07.219 --> 38:11.454
<i>The wise men saw the star
and followed it from afar</i>

38:11.456 --> 38:12.789
psst, lucy.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.724
<i>They found the stable
in the night</i>

38:14.726 --> 38:17.394
<i>Beneath the star
so big and bright</i>

38:17.396 --> 38:18.795
What's the matter?

38:18.797 --> 38:21.564
I can't remember my line.

38:21.566 --> 38:24.567
<i>The wise men left
the presents there</i>

38:24.569 --> 38:28.138
<i>Gifts so precious and so rare</i>

38:28.140 --> 38:30.640
What do you mean,
you can't remember it?

38:30.642 --> 38:32.442
I can't remember.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.477
<i>Look up, look up</i>

38:34.479 --> 38:36.646
<i>The star still stands</i>

38:36.648 --> 38:40.150
<i>Seen by millions in the lands</i>

38:40.152 --> 38:43.253
You'd better remember it
right now, you blockhead,

38:43.255 --> 38:46.323
Or when I get home,
I'll slug you.

38:46.325 --> 38:49.125
<i>The star that shone at bethlehem</i>

38:49.127 --> 38:52.162
<i>Still shines for us today</i>

38:52.164 --> 38:54.130
Merry christmas.

38:54.132 --> 38:56.066
Thank you.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.936
I hope spike made it back home.

38:59.938 --> 39:04.307
I hope he got home in time
to celebrate christmas.

39:19.458 --> 39:23.660
I drew a picture of your dog.
Would you like to buy it?

39:23.662 --> 39:25.462
Are you a starving artist?

39:25.464 --> 39:28.198
If you were a starving artist,
I'd buy it.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.668
All I had for breakfast
was a waffle.

39:31.670 --> 39:34.704
Well, can you at least
ask snoopy to come out

39:34.706 --> 39:37.607
And pull me on my sled?

39:38.810 --> 39:40.510
Is he coming out?

39:40.512 --> 39:43.513
I don't know.
He can't stop laughing.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.148
Please ask him again.

39:45.150 --> 39:49.052
I just want him to pull me
a little ways.

39:50.188 --> 39:52.989
He wants to know
if you have a silver harness

39:52.991 --> 39:56.192
With golden bells
and fancy tassels.

39:56.194 --> 40:00.430
Hey, I'm lucky
that I even have a sled.

40:02.401 --> 40:05.068
Rerun really misses spike.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.270
Maybe you could help him
with the sled?

40:21.520 --> 40:25.121
Rerun:
Maybe a dog is too much trouble.

40:30.395 --> 40:33.229
Sometimes I lie awake at night

40:33.231 --> 40:37.567
And I ask,
"when will it all end?"

40:37.569 --> 40:40.570
Then a voice comes to me
that says,

40:40.572 --> 40:43.706
"right after the credits."

41:18.977 --> 41:20.410
Charlie:
Oh, boy.

41:20.412 --> 41:24.514
Only one more minute until
christmas vacation starts...

41:24.516 --> 41:28.751
And the teacher hasn't given
us any assignments over the
holidays.

41:31.356 --> 41:33.389
Oh, no.

41:37.696 --> 41:40.330
I can't believe it.

41:41.600 --> 41:46.336
I've just had my whole vacation
ruined, linus.

41:46.338 --> 41:50.507
We're supposed to read war and
peace by leo tolstoy...

41:50.509 --> 41:53.209
And then write a book report
about it.

41:53.211 --> 41:56.346
What a way to ruin a vacation.

42:38.323 --> 42:41.224
How are you doing with war and
peace, charlie brown?

42:41.226 --> 42:44.193
I just finished reading the dust
jacket.

42:44.195 --> 42:47.163
Many is the book report
that has been written...

42:47.165 --> 42:49.933
By just reading the dust jacket.

42:49.935 --> 42:54.103
But it's such a long book,
linus.

42:54.105 --> 42:59.876
Look, it's 1136 pages long.

42:59.878 --> 43:02.545
I bet it weighs more than I do.

43:02.547 --> 43:06.416
When leo tolstoy
was writing war and peace...

43:06.418 --> 43:11.220
His wife, sonya,
copied it for him seven times.

43:11.222 --> 43:16.459
And she did it by candlelight
and with a dip pen.

43:16.461 --> 43:21.097
And sometimes she had to use a
magnifying glass...

43:21.099 --> 43:23.366
To make out what he had written.

43:23.368 --> 43:24.801
Linus, I really...

43:24.803 --> 43:28.471
She had to do it after their
child had been put to bed...

43:28.473 --> 43:30.940
And the servants
had gone to their garrets...

43:30.942 --> 43:33.376
And it was quiet in the house.

43:33.378 --> 43:34.877
Just think, charlie brown...

43:34.879 --> 43:39.482
She wrote the book seven
times with a dip pen.

43:39.484 --> 43:42.919
And you're telling me
you can't even read it once?

43:50.962 --> 43:52.629
Hello?

43:52.631 --> 43:56.599
Hi, chuck. This is peppermint
patty.

43:56.601 --> 43:57.767
Oh, hi.

43:57.769 --> 43:59.302
Great news, chuck.

43:59.304 --> 44:02.505
Marcie and I are gonna throw
a new year's party.

44:02.507 --> 44:07.143
You know, ring out the old
and bring in the new?

44:07.145 --> 44:10.313
Well, I don't think I can...

44:10.315 --> 44:12.348
It's gonna be great, chuck.

44:12.350 --> 44:14.817
Games and dancing and
everything.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.653
But I don't dance.

44:16.655 --> 44:20.757
And besides,
I have to read war and peace.

44:20.759 --> 44:25.161
This is your chance to ask the
girl of your choice, chuck.

44:25.163 --> 44:30.867
And I guess we know who that
will be, huh, chuck, you sly
dog?

44:30.869 --> 44:32.602
But you don't understand.

44:32.604 --> 44:36.372
Like I said, I can't do anything
over vacation because...

44:36.374 --> 44:39.509
I know you're a little nervous,
chuck...

44:39.511 --> 44:42.345
Being it's your first real date.

44:42.347 --> 44:44.614
Call me later, chuck.

44:44.616 --> 44:46.783
Boy, we were just with marcie.

44:46.785 --> 44:49.452
There's gonna be
a great new year's party.

44:49.454 --> 44:51.387
It's boy-ask-girl.

44:51.389 --> 44:54.891
And I just know
my sweet baboo will ask me.

44:54.893 --> 44:57.493
I am not your sweet baboo!

44:57.495 --> 45:00.863
And I wouldn't invite you
to a chicken race.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.399
Isn't he the cutest thing?

45:03.401 --> 45:07.704
And I expect a certain piano
player to ask me.

45:07.706 --> 45:09.872
But I've got this book report to
do.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.642
I'm enrolling us in a dance
class.

45:12.644 --> 45:18.514
A new year's party is not a
party without lots of dancing.

45:18.516 --> 45:22.552
I'll never be able
to read that book, linus.

45:25.490 --> 45:28.825
What are you going to do,
charlie brown?

45:28.827 --> 45:32.195
Pardon me, but do you have a
comic book called war and peace?

45:33.498 --> 45:36.733
No?
Do you have a record of war and
peace?

45:37.736 --> 45:39.068
No?

45:39.070 --> 45:41.270
How about a tape or a cassette?

45:42.741 --> 45:43.940
No?

45:43.942 --> 45:46.743
Well, thanks, anyway.

45:46.745 --> 45:49.412
How about a computer game
about war and peace?

45:50.849 --> 45:52.048
No?

45:52.050 --> 45:53.082
Hmm.

45:55.420 --> 45:59.622
You didn't ask about filmstrips,
charlie brown.

46:06.598 --> 46:10.600
No, they don't have it
on filmstrips either.

46:24.249 --> 46:27.583
Charlie: "well, prince, genoa
and lucca are now no more...

46:27.585 --> 46:31.287
Than private estates
of the bonaparte family.

46:31.289 --> 46:36.993
No, I warn you that if you do
not tell me we are at war...

46:36.995 --> 46:44.995
If you again allow yourself
to palliate all the infamies and
atrocities...."

46:45.470 --> 46:48.805
Well, here I am reading war and
peace...

46:48.807 --> 46:52.241
And everybody else
is at dance class having fun.

46:52.243 --> 46:55.444
Maybe I should go over to the
class and just look in.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.680
See what they're all doing.

47:35.854 --> 47:39.522
Come on, chuck.
We're learning to foxtrot.

47:39.524 --> 47:41.757
But I have to read my book.

47:50.201 --> 47:54.203
Woman:
Slow, slow, quick, quick

47:54.205 --> 47:56.639
Move across the floor

47:56.641 --> 48:00.476
Slow, slow, quick, quick

48:00.478 --> 48:02.645
I'm only on page 5 of my book.

48:02.647 --> 48:05.648
Woman:
Shoulders back, stomach in

48:05.650 --> 48:08.551
Take a deep breath
now let's begin

48:08.553 --> 48:12.321
Again slow, slow, quick, quick

48:12.323 --> 48:14.390
It's really lots of fun

48:14.392 --> 48:18.160
Just follow the footprints on
the floor

48:18.162 --> 48:20.463
And you'll move as one

48:33.344 --> 48:36.612
Slow, slow, quick, quick

48:36.614 --> 48:39.415
Just think of fred astaire

48:39.417 --> 48:45.087
Once you get the feeling
you'll be flying through the air

48:45.089 --> 48:48.424
Now just relax glide along

48:48.426 --> 48:51.594
Keep the rhythm of the song

48:51.596 --> 48:54.463
Slow, slow, quick, quick

48:54.465 --> 48:57.099
Slow, slow, quick, quick

48:57.101 --> 49:00.469
Slow, slow, quick, quick
slow, slow, quick, quick

49:00.471 --> 49:02.772
Slow, slow, quick, quick
slow, slow

49:10.581 --> 49:12.815
Good grief.

49:15.787 --> 49:18.621
Charlie: "he spoke in that
elaborately choice french...

49:18.623 --> 49:22.491
In which our forefathers
not only spoke but thought.

49:22.493 --> 49:26.295
And with those slow
patronizing intonations...

49:26.297 --> 49:32.068
Peculiar to a man of
importance who has grown old in
court society...

49:32.070 --> 49:38.174
He went up to anna pavlovna,
kissed her hand, presenting her
with a..."

49:38.176 --> 49:43.346
I wonder when my sweet baboo
is going to ask me to the party.

49:43.348 --> 49:46.115
I am not your sweet baboo!

49:46.117 --> 49:49.652
And I wouldn't invite you
to a garage sale.

49:49.654 --> 49:52.855
Isn't he the cutest thing?

50:09.474 --> 50:13.275
Rerun, you must be doing
something wrong.

50:13.277 --> 50:17.279
Balloons are supposed to be
round, not square.

50:17.281 --> 50:22.118
You must be blowing air
into the wrong places.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.120
Here, try it again.

50:28.693 --> 50:31.927
You blow up a balloon this way.

50:34.532 --> 50:38.667
Okay, now let's see you do it.

50:38.669 --> 50:42.838
Try blowing slower.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.074
Now you're getting it.

50:48.813 --> 50:51.414
Here, I've got another type of
balloon.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.649
Watch.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.625
Now you try it.

51:18.276 --> 51:22.344
Well, are you taking me
to the party or not?

51:22.346 --> 51:24.780
Musicians don't dance.

51:24.782 --> 51:29.118
Anyway, I'll be playing the
piano at the party.

51:29.120 --> 51:34.290
I don't mind the rejection.
It's the smile that bugs me.

51:34.292 --> 51:39.595
If you don't ask me to the
party, I'll just go with someone
else.

51:39.597 --> 51:43.332
Good. Go with someone else.

51:45.103 --> 51:49.405
Charlie: "anna pavlovna's
drawing room gradually began to
fill.

51:49.407 --> 51:53.742
The people of the highest
distinction in petersburg were
there...

51:53.744 --> 51:56.779
People very different
in ages and characters."

52:05.990 --> 52:07.123
Hello?

52:07.125 --> 52:10.259
Hi, chuck. This is peppermint
patty.

52:10.261 --> 52:14.597
You thought any more about who
you're inviting to the party,
chuck?

52:14.599 --> 52:16.732
No, I haven't thought about
that.

52:16.734 --> 52:18.634
I'm reading war and peace.

52:18.636 --> 52:19.735
Uh-huh.

52:19.737 --> 52:21.270
I knew it would be me.

52:21.272 --> 52:25.508
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm only on page 5 of my book.

52:25.510 --> 52:30.646
Come on, chuck. Remember, you
have to invite somebody.

52:30.648 --> 52:33.315
Well, I suppose you're right.

52:33.317 --> 52:37.419
I wonder if that little
red-haired girl would go with
me.

52:37.421 --> 52:39.321
What?

52:39.323 --> 52:40.656
Do you think she would?

52:40.658 --> 52:43.893
So long forever, chuck.

52:45.196 --> 52:48.964
I've written an invitation
to the little red-haired girl.

52:48.966 --> 52:50.766
I was afraid to call her.

52:50.768 --> 52:54.503
It's too late to mail it, so I
thought I'd take it to her
house.

52:54.505 --> 52:55.938
But I'm worried.

52:55.940 --> 52:57.206
Why?

52:57.208 --> 53:01.844
All you have to do is slip the
letter into the mail slot...

53:01.846 --> 53:04.346
In the front door of the house.

53:04.348 --> 53:07.316
But what if my hand gets caught
in the mail slot?

53:07.318 --> 53:10.319
That's ridiculous, charlie
brown.

53:10.321 --> 53:14.356
Well, then, what if my hand
gets caught in the mail slot...

53:14.358 --> 53:17.326
And while I'm hanging there,
someone opens the door?

53:17.328 --> 53:23.132
Charlie brown, you worry about
the most impossible things.

53:33.878 --> 53:36.011
Hello? Hello?

53:36.013 --> 53:38.247
Heather, are you home?

53:38.249 --> 53:42.384
I've come to invite you
to a new year's party.

53:42.386 --> 53:46.855
I mean... I mean, if you don't
have anything else to do.

53:46.857 --> 53:50.159
Would you...? Would you like to
come?

53:50.161 --> 53:53.729
I could either pick you up
or... or meet you there...

53:53.731 --> 53:58.534
If I ever get my hand
out of this mailbox.

53:58.536 --> 54:00.402
I can't stand it.

54:00.404 --> 54:03.505
I just can't stand it.

54:29.767 --> 54:32.067
Charlie:
Tomorrow night's the party.

54:32.069 --> 54:37.106
The little red-haired girl
never answered my letter.

54:43.581 --> 54:46.582
What a way to start a new year.

54:46.584 --> 54:51.887
Tomorrow night, millions of
people will be going to parties
and dressing up.

54:51.889 --> 54:56.558
Some are even ready
a day ahead of time.

55:18.316 --> 55:22.251
It's too bad charles
couldn't come to the party, sir.

55:22.253 --> 55:25.321
I couldn't care less, marcie.

55:25.323 --> 55:28.490
It's too bad he had to write
that report.

55:28.492 --> 55:32.761
Okay, everybody, it's time to
play musical chairs.

55:32.763 --> 55:35.164
Hi. Can I come in?

55:35.166 --> 55:38.000
I thought you had to study.

55:38.002 --> 55:40.336
Well, I thought I could
read some of it here.

55:40.338 --> 55:44.506
Come on, chuck, admit it, you
sly dog.

55:44.508 --> 55:47.943
You wanted to start
the new year with me.

55:47.945 --> 55:49.778
Well...

55:49.780 --> 55:53.649
I was kind of hoping the
little red-haired girl would
show up.

55:53.651 --> 55:57.820
Chuck, you drive me crazy.

55:57.822 --> 55:59.188
Come on, sir.

55:59.190 --> 56:02.825
Everybody is ready for musical
chairs.

56:02.827 --> 56:05.794
Okay, okay. Let's get started.

56:05.796 --> 56:08.697
Can I play?

56:08.699 --> 56:12.534
Oh, I guess so, chuck. Come on.

56:17.141 --> 56:19.208
Patty: Hey, it's time
for musical chairs

56:19.210 --> 56:21.210
Come on, let's go

56:21.212 --> 56:24.046
Set up the chairs now
all in a row

56:24.048 --> 56:26.715
You run around the chairs
till the music stops

56:26.717 --> 56:29.718
And you have to find a seat
now, don't get caught

56:29.720 --> 56:32.688
'cause when the music stops

56:32.690 --> 56:37.192
You can't be standing there
if you wanna be a winner at
musical chairs

56:37.194 --> 56:40.195
Now we take away a chair
while you're runnin' around

56:40.197 --> 56:43.198
Don't let the kid in front of
you
get you down

56:43.200 --> 56:45.768
Just listen to the rhythm
now don't miss a beat

56:45.770 --> 56:48.937
'cause you don't wanna be the
only one
without a seat

56:48.939 --> 56:51.740
'cause when the music stops

56:51.742 --> 56:56.412
You can't be standing there
if you wanna be a winner at
musical chairs

56:56.414 --> 57:02.217
Now every time the music stops
you're gonna end up one chair
short

57:02.219 --> 57:05.587
And if you're boogalooing
when the music's gone

57:05.589 --> 57:07.923
Sorry, you gotta move on

57:07.925 --> 57:11.293
Now it's the moment of truth
it's getting down the wire

57:11.295 --> 57:14.296
You're burning up inside
with musical fire

57:14.298 --> 57:17.433
You hover around each corner
of the precious seat

57:17.435 --> 57:20.102
Waitin' for the moment
you can get off your feet

57:20.104 --> 57:23.238
'cause when the music stops

57:23.240 --> 57:27.276
You can't be standing there
if you wanna be a winner

57:27.278 --> 57:30.312
You've got to be a winner

57:30.314 --> 57:36.452
If you wanna be a winner
at musical chairs

57:36.454 --> 57:38.287
Yeah.

57:38.289 --> 57:40.889
Come on, charlie brown.
It's almost midnight.

57:40.891 --> 57:42.724
I'll pour you a root beer.

57:42.726 --> 57:44.326
Thank you, lucy.

57:44.328 --> 57:48.330
I've decided next year, I'm
going to be a changed person.

57:48.332 --> 57:50.766
Oh, be serious, charlie brown.

57:50.768 --> 57:52.234
No, I mean it.

57:52.236 --> 57:54.970
I'm going to be strong and firm.

57:54.972 --> 57:56.472
Forget it, charlie brown.

57:56.474 --> 57:59.341
You'll always be wishy-washy.

57:59.343 --> 58:02.010
Why can't I change just a little
bit?

58:02.012 --> 58:03.312
I've got it.

58:03.314 --> 58:06.582
I'll be wishy one day
and washy the next.

58:06.584 --> 58:09.585
Charlie brown, I have news for
you.

58:09.587 --> 58:10.686
You will never....

58:10.688 --> 58:13.121
You sniffed in my root beer.

58:13.123 --> 58:16.458
Your stupid beagle
sniffed in my root beer.

58:16.460 --> 58:20.629
Look at that.
I'll bet it's full of dog germs.

58:20.631 --> 58:24.700
Where are my binoculars?

58:24.702 --> 58:25.934
Ah-ha.

58:25.936 --> 58:28.337
I thought so.

58:28.339 --> 58:33.342
You see? It's filled with dog
germs.

58:33.344 --> 58:36.478
There's one thing you should
never do:

58:36.480 --> 58:40.115
Never sniff at someone's root
beer.

58:46.357 --> 58:49.358
Hey, chuck, wait for me.

58:55.032 --> 58:58.700
Hey, chuck, that was a sly move
on your part.

58:58.702 --> 59:02.638
You know, to get us out here
alone on new year's eve.

59:02.640 --> 59:03.872
Huh?

59:03.874 --> 59:08.677
Yep, we might end up ushering in
the new year together.

59:08.679 --> 59:14.082
-I bet you'd like that, eh,
chuck?
-Hmm.

59:14.084 --> 59:16.051
It's been a great year, chuck.

59:16.053 --> 59:18.654
You'll have to admit that.

59:18.656 --> 59:25.060
What do you think, chuck, would
be good rules for living in the
new year?

59:25.062 --> 59:27.062
Keep the ball low.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.364
Don't leave your crayons in the
sun.

59:29.366 --> 59:32.034
Use dental floss every day.

59:32.036 --> 59:34.102
Don't spill the shoe polish.

59:34.104 --> 59:36.505
Always knock before entering.

59:36.507 --> 59:39.107
Don't let the ants get in the
sugar.

59:39.109 --> 59:42.411
Never volunteer to be
a program chairman.

59:42.413 --> 59:44.780
Always get your first serve in.

59:44.782 --> 59:49.084
And feed your dog
whenever he's hungry.

59:49.086 --> 59:52.421
Will those rules
give me a better life, chuck?

59:52.423 --> 59:56.758
A better life and a fat dog.

59:58.262 --> 01:00:01.863
Have you made any new year's
resolutions, chuck?

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:03.198
Yes.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.901
You know how I always dread
the whole year?

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:10.939
Well, this time,
I'm only going to dread one day
at a time.

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:18.280
Hey, come on. It's almost
midnight.

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:21.183
Marcie:
Grab your partners, everybody.

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:27.222
You're weird, chuck.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:34.997
Charlie: "but alike in the set
in which they moved...

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:39.101
The daughter of prince
vassily, the beauty ellen...

01:00:39.103 --> 01:00:43.472
Came to fetch her father and
go with him to the ambassador's
fete.

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:48.176
She was wearing a balldress
with an imperial badge on it.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:51.446
The young princess bolkonsky
was there...

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:55.283
Celebrated as the most
seductive woman in petersburg.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:57.653
She had been married
the previous winter...

01:00:57.655 --> 01:01:00.489
And was not now going out
into the great world...

01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:04.426
On account
of her interesting condition...

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:08.163
But was still to be seen
at small parties.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:13.802
Prince ippolit, the son of
prince vassily, came too with
mortemart...

01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:16.338
Whom he introduced."

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.321
Oh, hi.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:37.025
You are heather, aren't you?
Please come in.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:41.329
Charlie brown told me
he had invited you to the party.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:44.499
I don't know where charlie brown
is right now.

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:47.035
But would you like to dance?

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:56.344
Chuck, where are you?

01:01:56.346 --> 01:02:00.215
It's just a few seconds before
midnight.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.451
Chuck, chuck.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.297
Chuck, how could you do this to
me?

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:54.770
When midnight came along,
I was the only one standing all
alone.

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:56.271
I, uh... I...

01:02:56.273 --> 01:03:01.543
Big brother, my sweet baboo
didn't dance with me at
midnight.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.245
And do you know why?

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:04.946
Well, uh, I, uh....

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:09.151
Because he danced with your
friend, the little red-haired
girl.

01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:11.953
He did what?

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:15.957
Gee, charlie brown,
I didn't know where you went.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:20.295
But, wow, your friend is sure a
good dancer.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:23.064
You mean she was here?

01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:28.970
The little red-haired girl was
here and I missed her?

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:44.252
Happy new year, charles.

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:57.699
Hurry up, charlie brown.
We'll be late for school.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:04.172
Did you finish war and peace,
charlie brown?

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:07.509
I finished at 3:00 this morning.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:10.212
How did you like it, charlie
brown?

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:13.415
I don't remember a thing.

01:04:14.618 --> 01:04:18.220
- Did you turn in your report?
- Yes.

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:20.956
What did the teacher say about
it?

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:22.824
What grade did you get?

01:04:22.826 --> 01:04:24.359
A d-minus.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.629
The lowest grade without
failing.

01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:30.799
Gee, I'm sorry, charlie brown.

01:04:30.801 --> 01:04:33.201
The teacher said it looked like
the sort of report...

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:38.974
That was written after
midnight on the last day of
christmas vacation.

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:40.575
What did you say?

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:42.577
What could I say?

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:47.749
I congratulated her
on her remarkable insight.

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:51.486
Did you see what our next
assignment is?

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:53.555
No. What is it?

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:59.227
To read crime and punishment
by dostoevsky.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:02.797
Happy new year, charlie brown.
