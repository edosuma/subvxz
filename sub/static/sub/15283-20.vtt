00:15.868 --> 00:18.133
How are you feeling today?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.133
You let me smoke.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.000
What more can I ask for?

00:29.033 --> 00:30.868
Most patients
Have a hard time

00:30.934 --> 00:32.467
Coping with
new surroundings.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.267
They probably believe
they'll be released.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.400
I'm not so naive.

00:36.467 --> 00:38.300
You don't believe
you'll be getting out?

00:38.367 --> 00:40.801
Would you let me out?

00:42.567 --> 00:45.033
I'd like to talk
about Adam.

00:46.701 --> 00:48.367
He's still missing.

00:49.868 --> 00:51.534
So I've heard.

00:51.601 --> 00:53.634
Will you help us find him?

00:53.701 --> 00:55.434
No.

00:55.501 --> 00:56.934
Why not?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.200
What more
do you need to hide?

00:59.267 --> 01:01.434
I'm not hiding anything.

01:01.501 --> 01:04.033
And I think the better
question would be,

01:04.099 --> 01:05.634
What are you looking for...

01:05.701 --> 01:07.701
Dr. Reid?

01:11.400 --> 01:13.634
I think you know
what I'm looking for.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.200
I want to hear you say it.

01:19.267 --> 01:22.334
I am looking for adam.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.367
Just because you caught me

01:24.434 --> 01:26.801
Doesn't mean you'll find him.

01:26.868 --> 01:29.434
You're not that smart.

01:29.501 --> 01:31.834
This isn't about
being smart.

01:31.901 --> 01:34.367
This is about
doing the right thing.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.267
I did the right thing.

01:43.033 --> 01:46.467
[crowd cheering, shouting]

01:48.033 --> 01:51.334
[song playing, indistinct]

02:13.801 --> 02:16.801
[laughter and loud chatter]

02:23.701 --> 02:26.300
[beeping]

02:34.868 --> 02:37.801
Chandler, looks like
I got the night off after all.

02:37.868 --> 02:41.801
Yeah, what she don't know
Only makes it that much better.

02:41.868 --> 02:43.701
[laughs]

02:43.767 --> 02:45.968
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.400
Right.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.300
I'm gonna change
And I'll, uh...

02:49.367 --> 02:50.701
I'll hit you back.

03:00.534 --> 03:03.567
Hey, I saw you earlier,
didn't i?

03:03.634 --> 03:06.133
My name's Dan.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.767
[song playing softly]

03:27.200 --> 03:32.200
[loud music playing]

03:36.167 --> 03:38.200
[muffled screaming]

03:41.934 --> 03:46.334
[screaming]

03:48.567 --> 03:50.734
[screaming]

03:59.033 --> 04:00.267
Adam.

04:01.934 --> 04:02.868
Adam!

04:08.033 --> 04:09.667
Where's madison?
I thought you were off.

04:09.734 --> 04:11.567
Oh, she wasn't feeling well,
so I sent her home.

04:11.634 --> 04:13.634
Listen, we had another
early checkout,

04:13.701 --> 04:15.801
So could you turn it over
before you clock out?

04:15.868 --> 04:17.300
What, I'm a cleaning lady now?

04:17.367 --> 04:18.934
I'm your boss, and you'll be-

04:19.000 --> 04:20.399
whatever I want you to be.

04:20.466 --> 04:21.868
Ok. What room?

04:21.934 --> 04:23.000
319.

04:29.868 --> 04:31.701
[heavy metal playing]

04:52.367 --> 04:53.934
[gasps]

04:57.367 --> 04:59.234
Daniel Keller, 21,

04:59.300 --> 05:01.934
A junior at benjamin
Franklin university.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.501
He was killed last night
while spring breaking

05:04.567 --> 05:06.300
In south Padre Island.

05:06.367 --> 05:07.801
C.O.D. Asphyxiation.

05:07.868 --> 05:10.934
He was the second victim to be 
murdered there in the past 3 nights.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.033
The first was william browder,
also on spring break,

05:14.100 --> 05:15.734
C.O.D. asphyxiation.

05:15.801 --> 05:18.234
They were both sexually
assaulted prior to death.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.567
Men being raped and murdered
on spring break?

05:20.634 --> 05:21.901
Well, that's a twist.

05:21.968 --> 05:24.434
So far the deaths have been
localized to one hotel.

05:24.501 --> 05:25.801
The Hudson Street Hotel.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.767
Initially, the hotel
was filled to capacity

05:27.834 --> 05:30.601
But lost 20% occupancy overnight.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.100
We should get a list
of everyone who works there.

05:32.167 --> 05:33.734
There's a good chance
one of them is the unsub,

05:33.801 --> 05:35.234
At the very least
has interacted with him.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.567
Yeah, Garcia's already on that.

05:36.634 --> 05:39.234
Both victims were discovered
by hotel staff,

05:39.300 --> 05:43.334
The last after online checkout 
indicated the room had been vacated.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.434
So he wanted the bodies discovered, 
and sooner rather than later.

05:46.501 --> 05:47.901
Reid: look at the way
they're posed--

05:47.968 --> 05:50.767
Naked, cowering
in the fetal position.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.434
He's sending a message. Something 
about this is important to him.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.801
We just need to figure out what.

05:55.868 --> 05:57.267
And we need to do it soon.

05:57.334 --> 05:59.601
The police suspect the unsub could 
be another vacationing student,

05:59.667 --> 06:01.501
Though I'm not willing
to rule out local involvement.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.868
Makes sense.
If the killer is a student,

06:03.934 --> 06:06.934
They could be halfway across the 
country by the time we're onto them.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.234
If he's a local,
we could lose him

06:08.300 --> 06:09.734
As soon as his
victim pool dries up.

06:09.801 --> 06:11.334
Either way, we're almost
out of time.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.334
South padre spring break
season ends this weekend.

06:18.267 --> 06:21.133
[muffled screaming]

06:55.334 --> 06:57.901
Reid: "Light thinks it travels
faster than anything.

06:57.968 --> 06:59.434
"But it is wrong.

06:59.501 --> 07:02.067
"No matter how fast
light travels,

07:02.133 --> 07:05.701
"it finds the darkness
has always gotten there first.

07:05.767 --> 07:07.567
And is waiting for it."

07:07.634 --> 07:09.767
Terry Pratchett.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.267
National media has picked up
on this story.

07:11.334 --> 07:13.467
We're gonna have to make
a statement when we land.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.067
We want to make people aware

07:15.133 --> 07:16.400
Without obviously
causing panic.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.100
Stress hypervigilance,
the whole buddy system,

07:18.167 --> 07:20.334
Yeah, I'm all over it. I just 
don't think anyone's gonna listen.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.767
What do you mean?

07:21.834 --> 07:24.267
Come on. Drunk college students
Don't exactly want to hear

07:24.334 --> 07:25.434
They shouldn't talk
To strangers.

07:25.501 --> 07:26.434
Right.

07:26.501 --> 07:28.601
Was there any dna
Left on the scene?

07:28.667 --> 07:30.601
Uh, yeah. Too much dna.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.167
This portion of the garcia show
Will be brought to you

07:32.234 --> 07:33.968
By the letter "i" for icky.

07:34.033 --> 07:36.400
The lab has recovered

07:36.467 --> 07:38.834
Over 100 different
Trace samples,

07:38.901 --> 07:41.367
As multiple guests
Create a cesspool of dna.

07:41.434 --> 07:44.467
Also, there is no way
To determine

07:44.534 --> 07:46.467
The exact time
Of "secretion"

07:46.534 --> 07:49.067
Or to eliminate anyone
Actually working at the hotel.

07:49.133 --> 07:50.467
Were you able to find
Any connection between

07:50.534 --> 07:51.667
The first two victims?

07:51.734 --> 07:53.267
No. They grew up
In different states,

07:53.334 --> 07:54.734
The went to colleges
On opposite coasts,

07:54.801 --> 07:56.234
I did the whole cross-reference
Credit card thing,

07:56.300 --> 07:57.367
Couldn't make it connect.

07:57.434 --> 07:59.400
So the hotel's
The only common denominator.

07:59.467 --> 08:01.601
Yeah. And it should be noted
That the first victim,
William browder,

08:01.667 --> 08:03.100
Wasn't exactly
A registered guest.

08:03.167 --> 08:04.300
Well, that's a popular
Thing to do.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.300
I mean, youngsters do it
All the time.

08:06.367 --> 08:09.701
They rent a room, they pack in
As many kids as possible
To save costs.

08:09.767 --> 08:11.968
We could be dealing with
Hundreds of unregistered guests.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.300
We need to check every
Guest, whether they were
On the books or not.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.601
Male raping male.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.968
So are we presuming our unsub
Or victims could be gay?

08:19.033 --> 08:20.567
That's not necessarily true.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.033
In male rape, sexual preference

08:22.100 --> 08:23.767
Typically has less to do
With the crime

08:23.834 --> 08:26.200
Than the power and dominance
The attacker feels
From the act itself.

08:26.267 --> 08:28.701
Still, it's a question
We should ask the families

08:28.767 --> 08:30.634
When we interview them.
It could help us

08:30.701 --> 08:32.299
Determine how
The unsub met the victims.

08:32.366 --> 08:33.868
We got a lot of work to do.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.967
Emily, jj, and I will go to
The local p.d.

08:36.033 --> 08:37.133
And start victimology.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.067
The rest of you,
There's your new home.

08:46.334 --> 08:48.834
You must be the fbi.

08:48.901 --> 08:49.968
David rossi.

08:50.033 --> 08:52.000
These are agents morgan
And reid.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.334
Julie riley.
I'm the manager.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.300
You were on duty when
The latest body was discovered?

08:55.367 --> 08:56.501
That's right.

08:56.567 --> 08:59.033
Did you happen to notice
Anyone out of the ordinary?

08:59.100 --> 09:00.367
I'm afraid not.

09:00.434 --> 09:02.100
You see so many faces
During the spring break,

09:02.167 --> 09:04.167
Pretty soon they all
Start to blur.

09:04.234 --> 09:06.167
We need to set up interviews
With the rest of your staff

09:06.234 --> 09:09.200
As soon as possible, also
Talk to the hotel guests.

09:09.267 --> 09:10.200
Of course.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.701
How many cameras do you
Have on the property?

09:14.767 --> 09:15.701
Not enough.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.767
We have all the main entrances

09:17.834 --> 09:19.200
And the garage covered.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.567
But the hallways
And the service tunnels
Aren't equipped.

09:21.634 --> 09:24.033
Can you show us the room
Where the last body was found?

09:30.667 --> 09:33.334
Um, I'll start rounding up
The rest of the staff

09:33.400 --> 09:34.767
For you to talk to.

09:34.834 --> 09:35.901
Thanks.

09:35.968 --> 09:38.901
No signs of struggle reported.

09:38.968 --> 09:41.300
Everything seemed normal
When housekeeping arrived.

09:41.367 --> 09:42.400
Look at this.

09:42.467 --> 09:45.267
Scratch marks
On the footboard.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.934
The victims were bound
Before the struggle began.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.701
Well,
That would make sense.

09:49.767 --> 09:50.968
Both victims were
In pretty good shape.

09:51.033 --> 09:53.300
Probably needed them tied up
In order to control them.

09:53.367 --> 09:55.968
The question is,
Was it consensual

09:56.033 --> 09:58.601
Or was it coerced?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.100
Reese evans.

10:04.167 --> 10:06.634
Agent hotchner.
These are agents
Prentiss and jareau.

10:06.701 --> 10:07.634
Hello.

10:07.701 --> 10:08.701
Well, thanks
For being here.

10:08.767 --> 10:10.467
If it's all right with you,

10:10.534 --> 10:12.434
We'd like to talk to the
Victim's friends and family
As soon as possible.

10:12.501 --> 10:13.767
Of course. Michael browder,

10:13.834 --> 10:15.334
The father
Of the first victim

10:15.400 --> 10:17.000
Has just arrived
To claim his son's body.

10:17.067 --> 10:19.000
And the second victim's
Girlfriend should be here
Within the hour.

10:19.067 --> 10:21.334
Does, uh, mr. Browder
Know the details

10:21.400 --> 10:22.601
Of his son's murder.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.300
Not everything. I mean,
There were certain matters

10:24.367 --> 10:25.868
I didn't want to bring up
On the phone.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.267
If you don't mind,
We'd like

10:27.334 --> 10:29.167
To handle that ourselves.
We're gonna have to ask him

10:29.234 --> 10:32.133
A few difficult questions
About his son.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.834
Honestly, I have been
Dreading it all day.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.267
I'll talk to the girlfriend.
Right this way.

10:36.334 --> 10:37.834
So if I'm the unsub
And it wasn't consensual,

10:37.901 --> 10:39.033
How does this work?

10:39.100 --> 10:40.601
You'd have to
Have a weapon.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.334
A gun to the face

10:47.400 --> 10:49.834
Means he doesn't scream out.

10:49.901 --> 10:51.200
Look at the distance

10:51.267 --> 10:52.968
Between where each
Of the arms were tied.

10:53.033 --> 10:55.567
There's no way
He could have tied
That second hand himself.

10:55.634 --> 10:57.901
Which means the unsub
Did it for him.

10:57.968 --> 11:00.167
Which would be risky,
Because if he knew
He was in danger

11:00.234 --> 11:02.934
And he saw the opportunity,
He would take it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.300
Then why not drug him
And then tie him up?

11:05.367 --> 11:06.467
Eliminate the risk.

11:06.534 --> 11:08.467
The tox screen came back
Negative.

11:08.534 --> 11:12.467
So it's either consensual
Or he has a partner.

11:12.534 --> 11:13.801
He's also learning fast.

11:13.868 --> 11:15.467
What do you mean?

11:20.033 --> 11:22.901
He hides the body
In the closet

11:22.968 --> 11:26.267
And then indicates
That the guest has checked out.

11:26.334 --> 11:28.501
Which means when the
Housekeeper gets here...

11:28.567 --> 11:32.000
Rossi: everything
Looks normal
And she starts cleaning,

11:32.067 --> 11:34.167
Wiping everything down.

11:34.234 --> 11:36.734
Erasing any fingerprints
Or dna which could have
Been left on the scene.

11:36.801 --> 11:39.567
We need to talk
To whoever
Cleaned this room.

11:39.634 --> 11:41.801
Maybe they saw something
That can tell us

11:41.868 --> 11:44.234
Who was in here
With dan keller.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.067
Mr. Browder, did your son
Have any history of drug abuse?

11:55.133 --> 11:57.501
Marijuana,
Methamphetamine, anything?

11:57.567 --> 12:01.434
None. He was an athlete
In high school and college.

12:01.501 --> 12:03.133
Tested regularly.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.634
Did he mention anything
About meeting someone here

12:05.701 --> 12:07.067
In south padre?

12:07.133 --> 12:08.501
Old acquaintances?

12:08.567 --> 12:11.501
He came down with some
Friends from his school.

12:11.567 --> 12:14.334
They wanted to blow off
Steam before finals.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.834
Mr. Browder,
Was your son gay?

12:16.901 --> 12:19.067
He had had sex with a man
Before he died.

12:19.133 --> 12:21.434
Knowing whether or not
It was consensual

12:21.501 --> 12:24.000
Will help us determine
How he was targeted.

12:27.634 --> 12:29.534
Adam jackson?

12:29.601 --> 12:32.167
Your manager said
We could find you up here.

12:32.234 --> 12:35.667
Uh--i--i get migraines.

12:35.734 --> 12:37.267
You discovered
The body last night?

12:37.334 --> 12:38.267
Yeah.

12:38.334 --> 12:39.334
Had you ever
Seen him before?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.734
Or noticed anyone
He may have been with?

12:41.801 --> 12:43.300
I've never seen him
Before in my life

12:43.367 --> 12:46.767
Until I opened the closet, and
I can't get him out of my head.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.634
Adam, what about the first
Victim, william browder?

12:50.701 --> 12:53.300
Have you ever seen him
Before?

12:53.367 --> 12:55.334
Never seen either of them.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.834
Let me ask you this--
Is there anything

12:56.901 --> 13:00.901
You remember about the room
Before you discovered
The body? Uh...

13:00.968 --> 13:02.801
It might not seem
Like much,
But the smallest detail

13:02.868 --> 13:04.167
Could really help us
A lot.

13:04.234 --> 13:05.934
It looked pretty normal.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.968
I mean, until I opened
The closet door.

13:10.033 --> 13:12.834
Did anything stand out
About the body?

13:12.901 --> 13:16.434
Or, uh, for that matter,
Anyone at the hotel
Last night?

13:16.501 --> 13:19.634
No, man. You seen
One drunk frat guy,
You seen 'em all.

13:19.701 --> 13:21.534
Adam, I thought you said
You didn't recognize him.

13:21.601 --> 13:22.567
I didn't.

13:22.634 --> 13:25.434
I just--i grew up
In corpus christi

13:25.501 --> 13:27.634
Across the bridge.
I know the type.

13:27.701 --> 13:29.267
They walk around like
They own the place,

13:29.334 --> 13:30.834
You know?
Think they can do
Whatever they want.

13:30.901 --> 13:32.601
Reid: how long
Have you worked here?

13:32.667 --> 13:35.067
6 months, I guess.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.801
Appreciate your time.

13:37.868 --> 13:39.300
Thank you.

13:39.367 --> 13:41.334
Can I ask you a question?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.000
Yeah.

13:44.267 --> 13:45.667
Uh...

13:45.734 --> 13:47.634
You've seen bad stuff,
Right?

13:49.067 --> 13:50.501
I have, yeah.

13:50.567 --> 13:54.200
How long before
You can close your eyes
Without it being there?

13:56.901 --> 13:58.467
I'm afraid
I still don't know.

14:04.868 --> 14:07.534
Morgan and reid
Are finishing the interview.

14:07.601 --> 14:09.234
What did you learn?

14:09.300 --> 14:10.634
It doesn't look like either
Of our victims was gay.

14:10.701 --> 14:12.367
Dan keller's girlfriend
Describes him

14:12.434 --> 14:15.000
As overtly sexual and
Aggressive towards women.

14:15.067 --> 14:18.033
It caused quite a few
Problems in their
Relationship.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.133
And his friends said
They were out partying
Prior to his death,

14:20.200 --> 14:21.467
And he was definitely
Willing to overlook

14:21.534 --> 14:23.000
The fact that he had
A girlfriend.

14:23.067 --> 14:25.000
Does that match with what
You found at the scene?

14:25.067 --> 14:26.534
Yes and no.

14:26.601 --> 14:27.767
What do you mean?

14:27.834 --> 14:29.267
The victims
Were both big guys,

14:29.334 --> 14:30.734
Yet there were no signs
Of a struggle.

14:30.801 --> 14:34.334
We profiled it as either
Being consensual or...

14:34.400 --> 14:36.100
The unsub had a partner.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.334
Sounds right.
What's your hesitation?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.300
What if it was both?

14:40.367 --> 14:42.000
How so?

14:42.067 --> 14:43.901
Well, even if he was
Confronted by two men,

14:43.968 --> 14:47.067
The first reaction
Of an alpha male
Would be to fight.

14:47.133 --> 14:49.033
But not if it were a woman.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.434
It's spring break.

14:50.501 --> 14:52.200
She lures the victim
To her hotel room,

14:52.267 --> 14:54.534
Ties him up, then
Once he's subdued...

14:54.601 --> 14:56.334
Her partner arrives.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.133
That could explain
The posing and the rape.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.434
The victims are alpha males
With aggressive sexual
Tendencies.

15:03.501 --> 15:07.400
The unsub treats his victims
The way they treat women.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.067
So we have a team.

15:09.133 --> 15:11.767
A woman who lures them
Back to their hotel room
And ties them up...

15:11.834 --> 15:14.400
And a man who rapes
And murders them.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.667
[music playing]

15:33.133 --> 15:34.601
Thanks, man.

15:49.634 --> 15:51.767
Oh, look at that.

15:51.834 --> 15:55.033
Whoa ho,
Where are you going?

15:55.100 --> 15:57.868
Don't worry about it.

16:30.234 --> 16:32.667
Your unsubs
Have changed hotels.

16:32.734 --> 16:34.267
What can you tell us?

16:34.334 --> 16:36.133
The vic's name is carl cade,
Another spring breaker.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.267
Any witnesses?

16:37.334 --> 16:38.801
His friends saw him last night
Leave a party

16:38.868 --> 16:41.100
With a brunette
In a green dress.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.133
Both had been drinking
For most of the day,

16:43.200 --> 16:46.100
And he only caught a glimpse
Of the girl before
They left the party.

16:46.167 --> 16:49.300
And he found the body posed
Just like the others.

16:51.634 --> 16:54.334
It sounds like our theory
About the partners was right.

16:55.968 --> 16:58.100
Woman lures the victim back,

16:58.167 --> 17:01.400
She offers up a little kink,
Then ties him up.

17:01.467 --> 17:03.934
Only this time the unsubs
Ventured outside of
Their comfort zone.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.334
They changed hotels.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.934
Ok, so what's he doing,
Getting bolder
Or smarter?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.601
Well, the local police
Are on alert,
The fbi is here.

17:10.666 --> 17:13.300
They probably changed pattern
To avoid getting caught.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.701
Or because they saw us
At the other hotel.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.968
We need to go back
To hudson street.

17:20.032 --> 17:21.934
We believe at least
One of our unsubs

17:22.000 --> 17:24.099
Is either a guest
At the hudson street hotel

17:24.166 --> 17:25.501
Or possibly an employee there.

17:25.567 --> 17:28.166
We have agents in uniforms
Recanvassing
The entire property.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.000
But we all know
Kids on spring break.

17:30.067 --> 17:32.167
They migrate
From place to place.

17:32.234 --> 17:34.868
We can't be sure
That the killer's
Still on site.

17:34.934 --> 17:37.400
Which is why we need you
To circulate this profile.

17:37.467 --> 17:39.767
Hotch: we believe we're looking
For a dominant/submissive team,

17:39.834 --> 17:42.067
A man and a woman
Probably in their 20s.

17:42.133 --> 17:44.200
We are looking for
A heterosexual male

17:44.267 --> 17:46.467
Who most likely
Is submissive

17:46.534 --> 17:47.968
In his everyday life,

17:48.033 --> 17:49.868
With everyone
Except his partner.

17:49.934 --> 17:52.000
To her he becomes dominant.

17:52.067 --> 17:53.634
Hotch: his submissive
Female partner

17:53.701 --> 17:56.234
Will be socially awkward,
Of average intelligence,

17:56.300 --> 17:58.033
And emotionally unstable.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.868
Look for women
Who are reclusive,

17:59.934 --> 18:02.100
Have a problem with authority,
And can't interact

18:02.167 --> 18:03.534
With dominant personalities.

18:03.601 --> 18:06.901
This form of male rape is
About power and dominance.

18:06.968 --> 18:09.200
It is not about
Sexual orientation.

18:09.267 --> 18:11.234
So victimology is key.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.400
This team targets
Alpha personality males

18:14.467 --> 18:17.467
Who think that women
Are their right.

18:17.534 --> 18:19.434
Add drugs or alcohol
To the equation

18:19.501 --> 18:21.200
And now we're dealing
With eager victims.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.868
Even with
The mention of rape,

18:22.934 --> 18:25.601
An alpha personality
Fueled by intoxication

18:25.667 --> 18:27.434
Believes that he can
Control the situation

18:27.501 --> 18:29.067
And eventually gain
The upper hand.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.400
We'll need to blanket
The beach with fliers,

18:31.467 --> 18:33.534
Talk to other hotels
And bartenders.

18:33.601 --> 18:36.567
We have got 2 days
Until the spring break
Season ends,

18:36.634 --> 18:37.901
So let's get to work.

18:37.968 --> 18:39.801
Hey, hotch, I think
We got something.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.968
Check this--
No report of male rape
Anywhere in the area.

18:43.033 --> 18:44.367
It's not surprising
Since it's like one of

18:44.434 --> 18:46.734
The least reported crimes
On the books.

18:46.801 --> 18:48.067
I also looked at
Video surveillance

18:48.133 --> 18:50.133
For the hudson street hotel
On the days

18:50.200 --> 18:51.601
Of both murders,
And zip.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.567
Tell me there is
A "but" coming.

18:53.634 --> 18:56.968
But, I also looked
At the days leading
Up to both murders,

18:57.033 --> 18:58.267
And, wouldn't you know it,

18:58.334 --> 19:00.601
Jackpot of jackpots,

19:00.667 --> 19:03.934
That would be william browder,
Aka victim number one.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.634
I would like
To call him jerkface,

19:05.701 --> 19:08.667
Seemingly making advances
At damsel in distress,

19:08.734 --> 19:11.634
Aka hotel employee
Madison cooke.

19:11.701 --> 19:14.467
See jerkface grab damsel,

19:14.534 --> 19:16.267
See adam jackson--

19:16.334 --> 19:17.868
Let's call him
White knight--intervene.

19:17.934 --> 19:20.734
See jerkface
Knock white knight down.

19:20.801 --> 19:23.400
See white knight pause.

19:23.467 --> 19:26.167
See white knight
Go postal.

19:26.234 --> 19:27.834
Didn't the maintenance man
Find the second victim?

19:27.901 --> 19:28.968
Yeah.

19:29.033 --> 19:30.234
And he told reid and morgan

19:30.300 --> 19:31.734
That he'd never met either
Of the first two victims?

19:31.801 --> 19:32.801
Uh-huh. So why lie?

19:32.868 --> 19:34.767
Garcia, I need
Everything you can find

19:34.834 --> 19:36.000
On adam jackson.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.267
I'm already on that.

19:37.334 --> 19:38.734
Dave, are you
Still at the scene?

19:38.801 --> 19:40.267
Good, we've got
A possible.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.634
Where's adam jackson?

19:47.701 --> 19:49.334
I don't know.
What's going on?

19:49.400 --> 19:50.767
The day before
The first murder,

19:50.834 --> 19:52.334
You had an altercation
With the victim.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.467
It's spring break.
It comes with the territory.

19:54.534 --> 19:56.367
Yeah.
Adam stepped in?

19:56.434 --> 19:58.701
He doesn't strike me
As the type to stand up
To a bully.

19:58.767 --> 20:00.767
The guy was being a jerk.
Adam happened to be there.

20:00.834 --> 20:02.400
And you didn't think
It was weird

20:02.467 --> 20:05.567
That the same kid
Ended up dead
The next night?

20:07.367 --> 20:08.667
It wasn't adam.

20:08.734 --> 20:10.434
Then why hide the fact
That he got into a fight

20:10.501 --> 20:11.501
With one of the victims?

20:11.567 --> 20:13.167
Julie told us not to.

20:13.234 --> 20:15.067
She was just trying
To protect us both.

20:15.133 --> 20:16.400
Where's adam?

20:16.467 --> 20:18.367
I don't know. Honestly.

20:18.434 --> 20:21.901
He's supposed to be on duty,
But he disappears sometimes.

20:21.968 --> 20:24.300
He might be on the roof.

20:26.033 --> 20:28.334
Morgan, check the roof.

20:32.067 --> 20:35.634
Adam jackson's life
Reads like a "how to
Make an unsub" manual.

20:35.701 --> 20:38.901
Born in corpus christi,
Biological mother
Rosemary jackson.

20:38.968 --> 20:43.000
In and out of hospitals--
Broken arm, broken rib,
Exhaustion.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.434
The polite way
Of saying spousal abuse.

20:45.501 --> 20:47.167
Garcia: exactly.
And then

20:47.234 --> 20:49.567
She died suddenly
When adam was 5.

20:49.634 --> 20:52.100
Father unknown.
Adam was left
In the custody

20:52.167 --> 20:54.767
Of his stepfather,
Mark harrison.

20:54.834 --> 20:58.701
Then it became adam
Who was in and out of
The emergency room.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.267
He was eventually
Foster-homed in dallas

21:00.334 --> 21:02.634
Until he was granted
Emancipation at the age of 16.

21:02.701 --> 21:05.133
I would bet you
If we could see
Mark harrison back then,

21:05.200 --> 21:08.067
He would bear
A striking resemblance
To our unsubs' victims.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.901
Good work, garcia.
Keep digging.

21:12.534 --> 21:14.033
Adam!

21:15.267 --> 21:17.067
Come here.
Come here.

21:17.133 --> 21:18.501
What's happening?

21:18.567 --> 21:19.667
You're coming with us.

21:19.734 --> 21:20.934
I--i don't understand.
What's going on?

21:21.000 --> 21:21.968
Let's go.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.133
He doesn't really look like
The dominant partner type,
Does he?

21:29.200 --> 21:30.167
No.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.434
He's our guy.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.667
What makes you so sure?

21:35.734 --> 21:37.467
It's a classic profile.

21:37.534 --> 21:38.968
He grows up with
An abusive stepfather,

21:39.033 --> 21:40.567
Somehow manages to escape.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.400
Suddenly he finds himself
Back in the exact same area

21:42.467 --> 21:43.767
Where his abuser lives.

21:43.834 --> 21:45.934
He's surrounded by
Nothing but a bunch
Of alpha males

21:46.000 --> 21:47.400
That mirror
That type of behavior.

21:47.467 --> 21:48.801
He snaps.

21:48.868 --> 21:50.968
Did he have a problem with
You as an authority figure

21:51.033 --> 21:52.300
When you interviewed him?

21:52.367 --> 21:54.234
He backed away as if
He was a little skittish.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.734
And reid?

21:55.801 --> 21:59.067
Reid was a little less
Imposing and he opened up
About his life.

22:00.801 --> 22:02.133
Where's julie?

22:02.200 --> 22:03.868
We're trying to find her.

22:03.934 --> 22:06.434
She's gonna go ballistic.

22:07.901 --> 22:09.934
You're in a lot
Of trouble, adam.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.133
But I think
You know that, right?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.934
The only thing
That I did wrong

22:17.000 --> 22:19.167
Was leave work
Without telling my boss.

22:24.167 --> 22:26.501
I--i need to talk to julie.

22:30.167 --> 22:31.434
[clears throat]

22:32.734 --> 22:34.767
Adam...

22:34.834 --> 22:38.400
Why don't you tell me
About the fight you had
With that first victim?

22:42.133 --> 22:43.868
I don't remember.

22:48.133 --> 22:49.634
You don't remember?

22:52.634 --> 22:53.634
Uh...

22:57.000 --> 22:58.701
No.

23:00.234 --> 23:03.100
Adam, I really want
To help you out,

23:03.167 --> 23:06.000
But you're gonna have to do
A lot better than that.

23:09.834 --> 23:12.767
Please...

23:12.834 --> 23:14.868
I just need to talk
To julie!

23:18.234 --> 23:20.067
Hotch.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.234
I just got off with garcia.

23:23.300 --> 23:26.534
So, adam jackson doesn't
Just work at the hotel.

23:26.601 --> 23:27.601
He lives there, too.

23:27.667 --> 23:28.601
What have we got?

23:28.667 --> 23:29.767
When adam
Was kicked out of school

23:29.834 --> 23:31.434
For bad grades,
Drug possession,

23:31.501 --> 23:34.267
And petty theft,
He started staying
At the hotel.

23:34.334 --> 23:35.767
Julie riley pays his bills.

23:35.834 --> 23:37.434
Yeah.
The manager?

23:37.501 --> 23:39.601
She's bailed him out of jail
Twice in the past 4 years.

23:39.667 --> 23:41.133
She's also the one
That told madison

23:41.200 --> 23:43.934
To cover up the fact
That adam had a fight
With the first victim.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.601
What's the connection
Between julie and adam?

23:45.667 --> 23:48.901
Uh, it turns out
When julie was in college

23:48.968 --> 23:50.968
She volunteered
At the foster care facility

23:51.033 --> 23:53.834
Adam used to reside in
Between homes.

23:53.901 --> 23:55.601
She befriended him

23:55.667 --> 23:58.567
And became the surrogate
For the absent mother.

23:58.634 --> 24:01.033
And now she's his boss.
He owes her everything.

24:01.100 --> 24:04.400
Adam's not the dominant,
Julie is.

24:04.467 --> 24:05.400
[line rings]

24:05.467 --> 24:06.734
Garcia.
Yes, sir.

24:06.801 --> 24:09.267
I need you to track
Any movement on julie riley.

24:09.334 --> 24:11.534
Cell phone, credit card,
Atm withdrawal.

24:11.601 --> 24:13.100
I need a last known
Location.

24:13.167 --> 24:15.901
Julie riley used her
Credit card 15 minutes ago.

24:15.968 --> 24:19.901
I'm tying the address
To your gps...now.

24:19.968 --> 24:21.501
Let's go.

24:21.567 --> 24:25.000
[music playing]

25:12.167 --> 25:16.634
Believe me, kid,
This is your lucky night.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.534
* sugar *

25:28.367 --> 25:31.334
Do you have any remorse
For what you've done?

25:31.400 --> 25:32.767
Why should i?

25:32.834 --> 25:35.100
They got what they deserved.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.534
What about adam?

25:36.601 --> 25:40.000
Did adam get
What he deserved?

25:40.067 --> 25:42.267
Adam was special.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.100
Well, if he's so special,

25:45.167 --> 25:48.200
Why don't you tell me
How to find him?

25:48.267 --> 25:49.801
Because...

25:49.868 --> 25:52.834
He's in a better place now.

25:52.901 --> 25:54.434
That's not for you
To decide.

25:54.501 --> 25:56.501
You met adam.
Tell me I'm wrong.

26:00.501 --> 26:03.067
Adam, let's talk about
The fight you had

26:03.133 --> 26:06.100
With the first victim,
William browder.

26:06.167 --> 26:07.767
There's nothing to tell.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.567
He grabbed madison,
I tried to stop him.

26:10.634 --> 26:13.234
That guy was pretty big.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.901
So?

26:14.968 --> 26:17.567
Adam, guys like you and i
Aren't, uh,

26:17.634 --> 26:19.567
We aren't exactly
The fighting type.

26:19.634 --> 26:21.234
Well, madison's
A good person.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.734
She didn't deserve
To be treated that way.

26:23.801 --> 26:26.400
You see, now I'm really
Confused,

26:26.467 --> 26:29.634
Because you just told me that
You don't remember the fight.

26:29.701 --> 26:30.934
I don't.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.133
I mean, i--i don't,
But i--i do.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.801
You don't, but you do.

26:36.868 --> 26:39.868
Can--can you explain to me
How that works?

26:39.934 --> 26:43.133
I remember he grabbed
At madison,

26:43.200 --> 26:44.968
I tried to stop him,

26:45.033 --> 26:48.534
The next thing I knew,
Julie was pulling me
Out of the pool.

26:53.467 --> 26:57.367
Why did you tell your employees
To lie to my agents?

26:57.434 --> 26:59.567
Adam has a record.

26:59.634 --> 27:01.067
He found one of the bodies.

27:01.133 --> 27:02.901
I didn't want you
To take the easy way out

27:02.968 --> 27:04.567
And pin the murders
On him.

27:04.634 --> 27:07.067
Why do you look out for him?
Why did you bail him
Out of jail,

27:07.133 --> 27:08.701
Pay his rent
And all of his bills?

27:08.767 --> 27:11.300
He's had a rough life.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.234
And do you take advantage
Of that?

27:13.300 --> 27:14.400
No.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.767
Safe to say
He'd kill for you?

27:16.834 --> 27:18.067
No!

27:18.133 --> 27:19.567
Then explain it to me.

27:20.634 --> 27:23.667
What exactly
Is the relationship?

27:26.801 --> 27:31.067
We've been friends
Since I was just a kid.

27:31.133 --> 27:32.100
Are you lovers?

27:32.167 --> 27:33.367
[scoffs] no.

27:34.634 --> 27:37.267
Well, then why does she
Pay for everything you have?

27:37.334 --> 27:38.667
It's not like it's a handout.

27:38.734 --> 27:41.834
I mean...I'm working
At the hotel
So I can pay her back.

27:41.901 --> 27:44.033
Does she pay for
The drugs also?

27:47.234 --> 27:49.667
I--i told you,
I get migraines.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.834
So, take a prescription.

27:58.334 --> 28:00.033
I thought you were different.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.434
What does that mean?

28:04.501 --> 28:06.300
Do you see something
In adam's past

28:06.367 --> 28:07.734
That reminds you of yourself?

28:07.801 --> 28:10.367
I don't know what you mean.

28:10.434 --> 28:14.167
In 2003, you reported
A sexual assault.

28:17.634 --> 28:19.634
And from the look
Of the file,

28:19.701 --> 28:23.133
The police didn't do
A very thorough job
Looking into it.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.734
I don't want to talk
About that.

28:24.801 --> 28:26.367
I'm gonna ask you
One more time,

28:26.434 --> 28:27.868
Would adam kill for you?

28:27.934 --> 28:29.300
No.

28:29.367 --> 28:30.534
Then prove it.

28:37.834 --> 28:40.601
You know a polygraph
Is not admissible.

28:40.667 --> 28:43.901
If we catch them in a lie,
It could help us
Get a confession.

28:43.968 --> 28:47.734
And we change interrogators
So they can't get into
A rhythm with their answers.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.200
State your name.

28:52.267 --> 28:54.033
Julie riley.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.534
Adam jackson.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.067
What color are your eyes?

28:57.133 --> 28:58.534
Blue.

28:58.601 --> 29:01.667
Where were you the night
Carl cade was killed?

29:01.734 --> 29:02.667
At work.

29:02.734 --> 29:04.167
At home.

29:04.234 --> 29:06.000
Who is the current president
Of the united states?

29:06.067 --> 29:07.501
Barack obama.

29:07.567 --> 29:09.234
Did you murder dan keller?

29:09.300 --> 29:11.000
Did you murder
William browder?

29:11.067 --> 29:12.300
No.

29:12.367 --> 29:13.701
No.

29:13.767 --> 29:15.601
What is 32 minus 19?

29:15.667 --> 29:17.267
Would you kill for julie?

29:17.334 --> 29:20.400
You lied about the altercation
With william browder.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.734
Is there anything else
You've lied about?

29:21.801 --> 29:22.767
No.

29:22.834 --> 29:23.868
No.

29:23.934 --> 29:24.901
Did you murder dan keller?

29:24.968 --> 29:25.901
What time
Did you leave work

29:25.968 --> 29:27.701
The night william browder
Was killed?

29:27.767 --> 29:29.067
I--i don't remember.

29:29.133 --> 29:31.367
Have you ever had
A sexual relationship
With julie riley?

29:31.434 --> 29:32.801
No.
Have you lied
About anything else?

29:32.868 --> 29:35.200
He's just a friend.
Did you murder
Carl cade?

29:35.267 --> 29:37.033
Using the formula
Y equals mx plus b,

29:37.100 --> 29:38.968
What does b represent?

29:39.033 --> 29:40.434
No.
Would adam kill for you?

29:40.501 --> 29:41.634
No.
Did you murder
Carl cade?

29:41.701 --> 29:43.100
Did you murder
William browder?
No.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.467
Absolutely not.
No.

29:44.534 --> 29:45.734
No.
Would you kill for julie?

29:45.801 --> 29:46.968
No.
No.

29:47.033 --> 29:48.801
No.
No.

29:52.868 --> 29:54.801
What are you looking at?

29:54.868 --> 29:56.133
I'm not sure.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.033
Well, they both passed.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.634
How is that possible?

29:59.701 --> 30:01.467
Not only that, they passed
With flying colors.

30:01.534 --> 30:03.968
The only spike
I got on adam
Was a control question

30:04.033 --> 30:06.601
Regarding geometric
Equations, but...

30:06.667 --> 30:08.834
Honestly, I think
I just flustered him.

30:08.901 --> 30:10.400
Either way,
We got nothing.

30:39.067 --> 30:41.868
Well, I think
My couch is calling.

30:41.934 --> 30:43.734
Sweet dreams.

30:43.801 --> 30:45.234
What about you?

30:45.300 --> 30:47.667
Clean the pool,
Change the a/c filter,

30:47.734 --> 30:49.667
Fix the heat lamps
By tonight.

30:49.734 --> 30:50.834
I got it.

30:50.901 --> 30:52.701
Yeah, thanks.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.701
So...where are we?

31:05.767 --> 31:07.467
Honestly? Nowhere.

31:07.534 --> 31:10.167
We just watched our two
Most viable suspects

31:10.234 --> 31:11.801
Walk out the door.

31:11.868 --> 31:13.467
If adam isn't our unsub,

31:13.534 --> 31:16.133
He has all the makings
To become one someday.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.534
Reid?

31:17.601 --> 31:19.434
Tell me the question
That he spiked under

31:19.501 --> 31:21.601
In the polygraph.

31:21.667 --> 31:24.167
It was a control question
To set the baseline.

31:24.234 --> 31:25.634
It was a geometric equation?

31:25.701 --> 31:28.167
Reid, I really think
He was just intimidated.

31:28.234 --> 31:31.367
He tried, he got it wrong,
But he wasn't supposed
To know the answer anyway.

31:31.434 --> 31:32.834
What if he lied?

31:32.901 --> 31:35.133
What if--what if
He knew the answer
To the question

31:35.200 --> 31:37.300
But intentionally
Got it wrong?

31:37.367 --> 31:38.701
I--i don't know.

31:38.767 --> 31:40.434
Why would he do that?

31:40.501 --> 31:43.033
Because he realized
That he wouldn't know
That answer.

31:43.100 --> 31:44.701
You're losing me, kid.

31:44.767 --> 31:46.334
Adam, are you in here?

31:46.400 --> 31:48.067
Reid: adam said he wasn't
Getting any rest.

31:48.133 --> 31:50.234
He takes midday naps
Because he's always exhausted.

31:50.300 --> 31:52.834
He has a history of blackouts,
Reclusive behavior,

31:52.901 --> 31:55.434
Prolonged repeated abuse
Suffered at the hands
Of a dominant male

31:55.501 --> 31:57.767
Who transferred abuse
From his female spouse

31:57.834 --> 31:59.868
To his prepubescent child.

31:59.934 --> 32:01.434
Where are you going with this?

32:01.501 --> 32:03.868
What if our unsub couple
Isn't a couple at all?

32:03.934 --> 32:06.934
Dissociative identity disorder.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.901
You think adam's
A multiple personality?

32:08.968 --> 32:10.234
Prentiss: well, it fits.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.968
Recurrent physical abuse,

32:12.033 --> 32:13.300
Knowledge he shouldn't have.

32:13.367 --> 32:14.534
We've seen this before.

32:14.601 --> 32:15.968
Look at this.

32:16.033 --> 32:17.300
All right?

32:17.367 --> 32:18.968
The first intervention
Is timid.

32:19.033 --> 32:20.467
It's apprehensive, right?

32:20.534 --> 32:23.267
But then he gets knocked down...

32:23.334 --> 32:24.801
There's a moment of calm,

32:24.868 --> 32:26.634
And then his entire
Body language changes.

32:26.701 --> 32:29.467
I saw this exact same
Transformation
When adam left the station,

32:29.534 --> 32:31.167
Only it wasn't rage,
It was, uh,

32:31.234 --> 32:34.300
Arrogance.
Like the alter ego
Wanted me to know.

32:34.367 --> 32:35.667
I don't know.
Why?

32:35.734 --> 32:37.000
Power, control.
All I know is the person

32:37.067 --> 32:38.501
That stared me down
Over there was not adam.

32:38.567 --> 32:39.701
He's not assertive
Like that.

32:39.767 --> 32:41.200
He doesn't make
Eye contact.

32:41.267 --> 32:43.167
So you think the stress
Of the interrogation

32:43.234 --> 32:46.100
Blurred the line between adam
And his alter personality?

32:46.167 --> 32:48.334
Reid: I think the unsub
Surfaced for just a moment.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.200
It knew the answer
To the question,

32:50.267 --> 32:53.000
Realized adam wouldn't,
And lied.

32:53.067 --> 32:55.934
So adam and the woman
In the green dress
Are the same person?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.501
We profiled the duo
Accurately,

32:57.567 --> 33:00.267
Only the dominant
Personalities and alter
Are inside of adam.

33:00.334 --> 33:02.434
And adam has no idea
He killed all those people.

33:02.501 --> 33:04.267
You could argue that adam
Didn't kill those people.

33:04.334 --> 33:06.701
A separate person
Inside of him did.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.467
I don't even know
What we do with this.

33:08.534 --> 33:10.567
We take him into custody,
We let the courts decide.

33:17.634 --> 33:19.033
I thought you were
Heading home.

33:21.701 --> 33:24.100
I found this in your room.

33:24.167 --> 33:25.801
You went in my room?

33:25.868 --> 33:27.133
What?
Yeah, i--

33:27.200 --> 33:29.334
You don't remember the fight
With william browder,

33:29.400 --> 33:31.300
You disappeared before
Dan keller was killed,

33:31.367 --> 33:32.801
And you won't tell me
Where you went.

33:32.868 --> 33:33.801
What are you saying?

33:33.868 --> 33:35.634
Why do you have this?

33:35.701 --> 33:37.501
It's not mine.

33:37.567 --> 33:39.501
It was hidden in your closet.

33:39.567 --> 33:41.300
Julie, this is crazy!

33:41.367 --> 33:42.334
Ju--ohh!

33:42.400 --> 33:44.534
Did--did a woman
Get you involved in this?

33:44.601 --> 33:46.133
No!

33:46.200 --> 33:48.000
If you turn her in,
Then I can help you.

33:48.067 --> 33:51.067
I didn't kill those people!

33:51.133 --> 33:52.868
I want to believe you, adam.

33:52.934 --> 33:54.501
[kicks] believe me!

33:57.634 --> 34:00.501
I think that we should
Go to the police together.

34:00.567 --> 34:01.934
[crying] no!

34:02.000 --> 34:04.767
I'll be right there with you.
We'll figure this out.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.767
Or I'll go by myself.

34:12.567 --> 34:14.801
[feminine voice]
I said no.

34:18.868 --> 34:21.701
Adam...what's going on?

34:26.333 --> 34:29.801
You shouldn't be up here.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.300
Adam...

34:31.367 --> 34:33.601
You're starting to scare me.

34:33.667 --> 34:36.601
My name is amanda.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.132
If you're in some kind
Of trouble, hon,

34:40.199 --> 34:41.967
I can help you.

34:42.033 --> 34:43.601
Adam doesn't need you
Anymore.

34:43.667 --> 34:44.734
Aah! Aah! Aah!

34:44.801 --> 34:46.634
No! No! No!

34:52.801 --> 34:55.801
[sirens]

35:03.801 --> 35:06.267
Reid and morgan,
Take the roof.

35:06.334 --> 35:07.767
We've got adam's room.

35:09.334 --> 35:12.367
Agent hotchner!
In the back!

35:12.434 --> 35:13.367
[gasping]

35:13.434 --> 35:14.767
Ok, guys, let's back up!
Back up!

35:14.834 --> 35:15.801
Excuse me.
Come on.

35:15.868 --> 35:17.701
Move, move!
[all talking at once]

35:17.767 --> 35:19.667
We've got a woman down
At the back of the hotel.

35:19.734 --> 35:22.000
Send medics as soon as possible.

35:22.067 --> 35:23.400
Julie? Julie,
Can you hear me?

35:23.467 --> 35:24.634
[gasping]

35:24.701 --> 35:25.634
Adam...

35:25.701 --> 35:26.634
Ok.

35:26.701 --> 35:27.968
Look, help is on the way.

35:28.033 --> 35:29.167
I need you not to move.

35:29.234 --> 35:32.467
It wasn't...him...
Strange...

35:32.534 --> 35:35.634
Julie, did he say
Where he was going?

35:35.701 --> 35:37.133
[gasping]
He called himself amanda.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.133
The alter personality.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.968
Reid, you were right.
Where would he go?

35:40.033 --> 35:41.434
Not he. She.

35:41.501 --> 35:44.133
Amanda, she panicked.
She knew we would
Connect this to her.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.167
Ok, ok, so she's feeling
The pressure.

35:46.234 --> 35:48.601
She obviously knows
She's running out of time.
Where would she go?

35:50.901 --> 35:51.868
[gasping]

35:54.133 --> 35:57.067
She's gonna go after the man
These victims represent.

35:57.133 --> 35:59.234
Garcia, please tell me
You know the whereabouts
Of mark harrison.

35:59.300 --> 36:01.501
The skeezy wife-beating,

36:01.567 --> 36:02.634
Child-abusing scumbag

36:02.701 --> 36:04.300
Never left corpus christi.

36:04.367 --> 36:07.400
Sending his address
To your pda.

36:07.467 --> 36:09.133
Go.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.501
[julie gasping]

36:10.567 --> 36:12.334
Medics!

36:12.400 --> 36:15.133
[sirens]

36:41.534 --> 36:43.667
Amanda.
Stay back.

36:43.734 --> 36:45.133
Put the knife down.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.033
Stand back or I'll kill him.

36:47.100 --> 36:48.400
You do not
Want to do that.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.334
You don't know what he did.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.501
When adam's mother died,
His stepfather needed

36:55.567 --> 36:57.901
A new outlet for his
Aggression, didn't he?

36:58.968 --> 37:01.501
He put adam in dresses.

37:01.567 --> 37:02.667
He beat him.

37:02.734 --> 37:04.000
He touched him.

37:04.067 --> 37:07.367
Adam was too weak
To go through
All of that alone.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.767
He was just
A little boy.

37:09.834 --> 37:11.434
He needed you

37:11.501 --> 37:13.133
To protect him.

37:14.334 --> 37:15.701
I could take it.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.934
I was stronger than he was.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.567
[labored breathing]

37:19.634 --> 37:22.133
He deserves to die.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.434
Amanda. Amanda.

37:23.501 --> 37:25.701
That's not for you
To decide.

37:25.767 --> 37:28.367
I swear to god,

37:28.434 --> 37:31.367
If you put him down
And you come with me,

37:31.434 --> 37:34.467
I will get you
And adam

37:34.534 --> 37:37.167
The help
That you guys need.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.467
Adam will be sentenced
For what I've done.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.300
No...

37:51.634 --> 37:52.968
I can't let that happen.

37:54.467 --> 37:56.901
Amanda.
If you kill yourself,

37:56.968 --> 37:58.100
You kill adam.

37:58.167 --> 37:59.834
I don't see how
That's protecting him.

37:59.901 --> 38:01.067
And you know what I know?

38:01.133 --> 38:03.601
I know that all
You want to do in this world

38:03.667 --> 38:05.467
It's all I've ever done.
Is protect adam.

38:05.534 --> 38:08.701
Then why don't you and i
Help him together.

38:08.767 --> 38:11.334
You can't help him.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.067
[gasping]

38:13.133 --> 38:14.601
I'm the only one.

38:16.667 --> 38:18.734
I know what I have to do.

38:19.834 --> 38:22.400
I will keep him safe forever.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.901
Unh!

38:27.801 --> 38:29.567
[gasping and coughing]

38:29.634 --> 38:30.834
Adam.

38:30.901 --> 38:32.100
Adam. Adam.

38:35.300 --> 38:36.801
Adam.

38:39.367 --> 38:42.434
Morgan: reid.
He's gone.

38:56.801 --> 38:58.667
It's time to go, kid.

39:00.634 --> 39:02.534
Reid.

39:03.601 --> 39:05.567
What's eatin' you, man?

39:07.300 --> 39:09.400
We've taken the victim
Into custody

39:09.467 --> 39:12.234
And let the abuser
Go free.

39:12.300 --> 39:13.601
I don't really--

39:13.667 --> 39:16.200
I don't see that
As much of a win.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.267
A lot of lives
Are gonna be saved

39:20.334 --> 39:22.400
Now that amanda's
Off the street.
You know that.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.501
Yeah, I just...

39:27.601 --> 39:30.601
I wish I could have
Noticed the signs
In time to save adam.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.601
Come on, don't do that
To yourself.

39:32.667 --> 39:34.434
None of us
Could have noticed.

39:34.501 --> 39:36.501
Our profile was right.
We just never considered

39:36.567 --> 39:39.667
That the team dynamic
Could be locked inside
One person's mind.

39:39.734 --> 39:41.334
I should have.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.968
Talk to me.

39:50.033 --> 39:51.467
What is this?

39:55.567 --> 39:57.434
Tobias hankel.

39:57.501 --> 40:01.200
Tobias hankel drugged
And tortured you for 2 days.

40:01.267 --> 40:02.634
He almost killed you.

40:02.701 --> 40:03.801
No, he didn't.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.968
The alter persona
Of his father

40:06.033 --> 40:07.467
Did those things to me.

40:07.534 --> 40:10.968
The real tobias hankel
Saved my life.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.234
He brought me back
From the dead.

40:13.300 --> 40:16.067
And you think because of tobias,
Somehow you owe adam?

40:18.601 --> 40:22.534
I just--i know that
He's still locked in
There somewhere.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.501
Kid.

40:32.567 --> 40:36.100
You're gonna have to
Accept the fact that sometimes

40:36.167 --> 40:38.501
We can't save everyone.

40:47.734 --> 40:49.934
Tell me, dr. Reid,

40:50.000 --> 40:53.033
How long will you keep
Visiting me in here?

40:54.534 --> 40:56.767
Until I find adam.

41:00.934 --> 41:03.434
Why do you care?

41:03.501 --> 41:05.300
He deserves a life.

41:05.367 --> 41:07.334
It's his.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.801
So you're trying to...

41:08.868 --> 41:11.100
Wear me down and release him?

41:11.167 --> 41:12.767
No.

41:12.834 --> 41:15.834
I'm just waiting for you
To do the right thing.

41:18.400 --> 41:21.868
Well, I'm afraid you'll be
Waiting for a very long time.
