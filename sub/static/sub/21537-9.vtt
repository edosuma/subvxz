- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:05.138 --> 00:06.406
- I AM SO GOOD,

00:06.439 --> 00:08.008
NOT ONLY THAT I BROUGHT YOU
YOUR FULL ASKING OFFER,

00:08.041 --> 00:10.310
BUT I BROUGHT TWO
FOR YOU TO CHOOSE FROM.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.745
NOW AM I A CHAMPION,

00:11.778 --> 00:12.846
OR AM I A [bleep] CHAMPION?

00:12.879 --> 00:14.714
- I'M PROUD.
- AHH!

00:14.748 --> 00:16.983
- I WANTED TO HAND-DELIVER
THE SIGNED AGREEMENT.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.118
- AWESOME.

00:18.151 --> 00:19.185
- YOU'RE GONNA HOLD THIS.

00:19.219 --> 00:20.387
- I MEAN, I--OKAY.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.622
OH, YOU STUPID
SON OF A BITCH!

00:22.655 --> 00:24.257
OH, YOU PUT THE CONTRACT
IN THE FLOUR!

00:24.290 --> 00:26.726
- WATCH OUT!
EVERYBODY, PADDLE!

00:30.163 --> 00:31.464
- WHEE!

00:31.498 --> 00:33.667
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,
BUT DON'T EVER COME

00:33.700 --> 00:35.902
TO ONE OF MY OPEN HOUSES AGAIN.

00:35.935 --> 00:39.105
[upbeat music]

00:39.139 --> 00:40.607
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:40.640 --> 00:44.477
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:44.511 --> 00:47.547
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:47.580 --> 00:49.449
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:49.482 --> 00:52.052
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.621
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:54.654 --> 00:55.955
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.390
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

00:57.424 --> 00:59.793
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

00:59.826 --> 01:01.061
- IT'S OVER!

01:01.094 --> 01:05.298

01:05.331 --> 01:09.102
[groovy music]

01:09.135 --> 01:11.104
[car horn tooting]

01:11.137 --> 01:12.572
- HI, ZACH.

01:12.605 --> 01:13.840
250 BOWERY, YEAH?

01:13.873 --> 01:15.742
AL, TAKE ME
TO BOWERY AND PRINCE.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.344
- OKAY.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.878
- AFTER I SOLD THE FIRST UNIT
IN MY LAST BUILDING,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.080
111 MERCER,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.182
THE OTHER UNITS SOLD
RIGHT AWAY,

01:22.215 --> 01:23.717
'CAUSE THE COMMS WERE SET
WITHIN THE BUILDING.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.085
CHING-CHING!

01:25.118 --> 01:28.755
AND TODAY, I HAVE YET ANOTHER
NEW DEVELOPMENT PITCH.

01:28.788 --> 01:31.791
250 BOWERY.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.494
THE BOWERY RIGHT NOW
IS LIKE A NEW MEATPACKING.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.296
THIS IS WHERE EVERYBODY WANTS
TO LIVE.

01:36.329 --> 01:37.530
ZACH?
- HEY, FRED.

01:37.564 --> 01:38.732
HOW ARE YOU?
[door shuts]

01:38.765 --> 01:40.133
- I'M SO EXCITED.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.936
I SUCCESSFULLY SOLD
TWO BUILDINGS FOR ZACH VELLA.

01:42.969 --> 01:44.304
- GOOD JOB.

01:44.337 --> 01:46.840
- AND NOW, MY NEW DEVELOPMENT
BUSINESS HAS EXPLODED.

01:46.873 --> 01:48.108
SO I'M, LIKE, THE GO-TO GUY.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.010
THIS IS IT? 250 BOWERY?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.878
BUT THIS BUILDING IS
TWICE THE SIZE

01:51.911 --> 01:53.913
OF ANY OTHER BUILDING
I'VE SOLD FOR ZACH.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.149
- TOTAL BUILDING IS
ABOUT 51,000 SQUARE FEET.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.784
I HAVE 24 UNITS.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.352
- OH, MY GOD.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.254
THIS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST
SUCCESS OF MY CAREER.

02:01.287 --> 02:05.658
CHING-CHING!

02:05.692 --> 02:07.127
WHOO-HOO!

02:07.160 --> 02:10.096
[laughs]

02:10.130 --> 02:11.531
WHY IS REAL ESTATE
SO MUCH FUN?

02:11.564 --> 02:14.067
ONE OF THE MOST IN-DEMAND
ARCHITECTS IN NEW YORK

02:14.067 --> 02:16.503
HAS DESIGNED THE BUILDING--
MORRIS ADJMI.

02:16.536 --> 02:18.905
HE DESIGNS THESE REALLY
INDUSTRIAL-INSPIRED

02:18.938 --> 02:20.807
SUPER-COOL BUILDINGS.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.643
IT'S LIKE AN OLD FACTORY ALMOST.
BEAUTIFUL.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.345
THIS IS ALL GONNA BE GLASS,
RIGHT?

02:25.378 --> 02:26.579
I LOVE IT.

02:26.613 --> 02:27.747
IN NEW YORK,
THE TREND RIGHT NOW IS

02:27.781 --> 02:29.816
FOR DEVELOPERS
TO DO MUCH LARGER,

02:29.849 --> 02:31.084
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE APARTMENTS

02:31.084 --> 02:32.352
THAT JUST CERTAIN PEOPLE
CAN AFFORD.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.920
THIS BUILDING IS UNIQUE,

02:33.953 --> 02:37.157
BECAUSE ZACH HAS DEVELOPED
SMALLER, EFFICIENT UNITS.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.491
THEREFORE,
THE ABSOLUTE PRICE POINT

02:38.525 --> 02:40.360
WOULD BE SOMEWHAT AFFORDABLE.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.862
AND THEN,
FOR THE BIG SPENDERS,

02:42.896 --> 02:46.366
250 BOWERY HAS FOUR
AMAZING TRIPLEX PENTHOUSES

02:46.399 --> 02:48.168
WITH PRIVATE OUTDOOR SPACE.

02:48.201 --> 02:50.203
IT'S AMAZING. CONGRATS.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.105
- OUR OFFERING PLAN
SHOULD BE READY

02:52.105 --> 02:53.840
IN ABOUT A MONTH,
MONTH AND A HALF.

02:53.873 --> 02:55.575
IN NEW DEVELOPMENT,

02:55.608 --> 02:57.243
WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL
AN "OFFERING PLAN."

02:57.277 --> 02:59.779
IT'S BASICALLY A PROMISE
TO THE BUYER

02:59.813 --> 03:01.414
THAT NEEDS TO BE APPROVED
BY THE GOVERNMENT.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.917
IF AN OFFERING PLAN
HASN'T BEEN APPROVED YET,

03:03.950 --> 03:05.452
THE PRICES IN THIS BUILDING
WON'T BE DECIDED FOR A WHILE.

03:05.485 --> 03:06.886
- TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
DIFFERENTLY

03:06.920 --> 03:08.188
WITH THIS BUILDING.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.823
- ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE
AN OFFERING PLAN APPROVED,

03:09.856 --> 03:11.057
SO I CAN'T LEGALLY SELL,

03:11.057 --> 03:13.493
I WOULD START LEAKING
RENDERINGS, PICTURES,

03:13.526 --> 03:16.563
AND PRELIMINARY PRICE RANGES.

03:16.596 --> 03:17.630
TO BUILD THE MOMENTUM.

03:17.664 --> 03:20.700
SO THE DAY THAT WE OPEN,
LIKE, BAM!

03:20.734 --> 03:23.803
BIG PARTY, AND SELL THE HELL
OUT OF THIS BUILDING.

03:23.837 --> 03:27.273
- ALL RIGHT.

03:27.307 --> 03:29.776
SO WE'VE HAD A GOOD RUN

03:29.809 --> 03:30.877
WITH THE LAST COUPLE
OF BUILDINGS

03:30.910 --> 03:31.878
THAT YOU MARKETED FOR US.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.913
- YOU MEAN THE BUILDINGS
THAT I SOLD OUT

03:33.947 --> 03:35.515
AT RECORD PRICES, YES.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.984
- I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT
YOUR FULL ATTENTION HERE.

03:38.084 --> 03:39.919
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE BEEN
MEETING WITH OTHER BROKERS.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.087
- WHAT?

03:41.121 --> 03:43.390
LET'S ASSUME
A $50-MILLION SELLOUT.

03:43.423 --> 03:44.457
RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.525
- WHATEVER THE MARKET IS,

03:45.558 --> 03:46.893
I'M GONNA GET YOU
5 MILLION MORE.

03:46.926 --> 03:49.162
HOW'S THAT?

03:49.195 --> 03:52.999
AND WHEN I SELL OUT THIS ONE
AT A RECORD PRICE,

03:53.099 --> 03:54.934
ALL YOUR NEXT BUILDINGS.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.703
YOU'LL NEVER SPEAK
TO ANY OTHER BROKERS.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.807
WE CEMENT THIS RELATIONSHIP
RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.576
- OKAY, FREDRIK, IT'S YOURS.

04:03.610 --> 04:04.711
- THANK YOU.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.912
ARE YOU EXCITED?
- OF COURSE.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.547
- IS YOUR HEART BEATING
LIKE MINE IS?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.749
THIS IS WHAT
I DREAM ABOUT--24 UNITS.

04:09.783 --> 04:13.286
ALTHOUGH I'M WEEKS FROM LEGALLY
BEING ABLE TO SELL,

04:13.319 --> 04:14.320
MY WORK STARTS TODAY.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.455
COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.523
LET'S SELL OUT
ANOTHER RECORD BUILDING.

04:16.556 --> 04:20.226
- OKAY.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.098
- WHAT TOOK US SO LONG
TO WORK TOGETHER?

04:25.131 --> 04:26.433
- EVER SINCE YOU CAME
TO KELLER WILLIAMS,

04:26.466 --> 04:28.635
I'VE BEEN THINKING
WE SHOULD COLLABORATE.

04:28.668 --> 04:30.770
- TODAY I'M PITCHING A LISTING
IN 220 RIVERSIDE BOULEVARD

04:30.804 --> 04:32.906
WITH MY COLLEAGUE
ANTONIA WATSON,

04:32.939 --> 04:34.741
WHO HAS ASKED ME
TO JOIN FORCES WITH HER,

04:34.774 --> 04:36.676
BECAUSE SHE HAS SEEN
THE AMOUNT OF PASSION

04:36.710 --> 04:38.378
THAT I PUT
INTO ALL OF MY WORK.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.413
SO TELL ME ABOUT THE SELLER?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.082
- SHE'S AN ACTRESS.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.818
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY
HER FAMILY'S APARTMENT.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.921
BUT HER PARENTS ARE, YOU KNOW--
THEY'RE OLDER.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.356
THEY WANT TO BE
IN MORE OF A WARM CLIMATE.

04:49.389 --> 04:50.523
- SO THEY'RE SERIOUS SELLERS.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.825
- THEY'RE SERIOUS.

04:51.858 --> 04:55.195
- 220 RIVERSIDE BOULEVARD IS
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.097
IT'S
A VERY PRESTIGIOUS LOCATION,

04:57.097 --> 04:58.298
BECAUSE IT'S VERY PRIVATE,

04:58.331 --> 05:00.700
AND IT ATTRACTS
VERY POWERFUL CELEBRITIES.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.335
- HELLO.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.636
- JEWEL, I'M ANTONIA.

05:03.670 --> 05:04.871
both: IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.573
- THIS IS LUIS.
- LUIS. NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:06.606 --> 05:07.741
- OH, LUIS, HI.

05:07.774 --> 05:08.908
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR HAVING US.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.477
- OH, COME ON IN.
- THANK YOU.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.313
- WOW.
- YES.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.715
- IN THIS APARTMENT
NO ONE CAN SEE.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.050
THAT IS THE WHOLE THING.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.486
SUPER, SUPER PRIVATE.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.054
WE HAVE SOME OSCAR AWARD-WINNERS
LIVING HERE.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.088
- REALLY?
- YES.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.290
- ARE YOU INCLUDED?
- ON THE WAY.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.060
I'M ON THE WAY.
[both laugh]

05:27.060 --> 05:29.129
- WE ALREADY HAVE
THREE EXPOSURES.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.332
IT'S A GOOD THING.

05:32.365 --> 05:33.433
I SAW THE MOLDINGS.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.735
EVERYTHING IS...
- ALL CUSTOMIZED.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.638
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.741
- SO YOUR PARENTS
BOUGHT THIS PLACE WHEN?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.610
- UM, ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.346
- YOU HAVE
A VERY LOVELY APARTMENT.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.647
SO WHAT PRICE
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

05:47.681 --> 05:53.319
- [stammers] YOU KNOW,
10 1/2 MILLION? 10 MILLION?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.355
- I THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE BIT AMBITIOUS.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.792
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
$3,400 A FOOT.

05:58.825 --> 06:00.026
- RIGHT.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.127
- THE AVERAGE
IN THIS BUILDING IS WHAT?

06:01.161 --> 06:03.129
IT'S ABOUT...
- 1,150.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.265
- WE CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT PRICE,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.866
- BUT THIS IS--

06:06.900 --> 06:08.301
THIS IS A DIFFERENT--

06:08.335 --> 06:09.669
IT'S
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY

06:09.703 --> 06:11.104
THAN ANY OTHER APARTMENT HERE.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.740
I WAS IN THE APARTMENT
THAT A-ROD BOUGHT.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.041
I DID NOT LIKE THE LAYOUT.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.377
AND I FELT LIKE
YOUR NEIGHBORS COULD SEE

06:17.410 --> 06:18.645
EVERY SINGLE THING
YOU WERE DOING.

06:18.678 --> 06:21.047
BUT IS IT WORTH
$2,000-A-FOOT MORE?

06:21.081 --> 06:24.084
- TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS THAT
AS A SITUATION,

06:24.117 --> 06:25.218
I THINK IT IS.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.220
- SO AT $3,400 A FOOT,

06:27.253 --> 06:30.557
YOU'RE STRETCHING YOURSELF
ALMOST $900 A FOOT ON TOP.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.092
- BUT I'M NOT STRETCHING MYSELF.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.060
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA STRETCH
YOURSELVES.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.795
YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
GREAT AT THIS.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.630
THEN LET'S, LIKE,
ACTUALLY CHALLENGE OURSELVES

06:37.664 --> 06:39.299
TO REALLY RAISE THE BAR.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.302
NOT, LIKE, PUSSYFOOT AROUND IT
AND BE LIGHTWEIGHTS.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.403
BUT, LIKE, REALLY DO IT.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.638
- HELLO, HELLO.
- SURE, SURE, YES.

06:45.672 --> 06:49.642
- OKAY, SO THE PRICE
THAT I HAVE IN MIND

06:49.676 --> 06:51.544
I THINK 7.4 MILLION
IS THE PRICE

06:51.578 --> 06:54.748
THAT WILL GET PEOPLE
IN THIS DOOR.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.486
- I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.722
I FEEL LIKE...THAT'S TOO LOW.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.625
- WHY DON'T WE TRY
THE MIDDLE GROUND?

07:05.658 --> 07:08.395
LET'S SAY ABOUT 9,250,000.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.498
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT?

07:11.531 --> 07:13.900
- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS IN REAL ESTATE,

07:13.933 --> 07:15.502
AND THIS I'VE LEARNED
THROUGH THE YEARS,

07:15.535 --> 07:17.804
IS TO BE ABLE TO SET
YOUR CLIENT'S EXPECTATIONS

07:17.837 --> 07:19.039
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.174
AND THE FACT THAT ANTONIA
IS SUGGESTING

07:21.207 --> 07:23.209
TO PRICE THIS UNIT
AT 9,250,000,

07:23.243 --> 07:24.411
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.712
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.614
- IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

07:27.647 --> 07:30.583
BUT I'M REALLY TRYING TO LISTEN
TO WHAT YOU GUYS ARE SAYING.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.853
SO I'D BE WILLING TO...

07:33.887 --> 07:35.088
GIVE IT A SHOT.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.190
- ALL RIGHT, JEWEL.
- WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.192
- THANK YOU, SUCH A PLEASURE.
- IT IS A PLEASURE.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.528
I CAN LET IT GO,
BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE

07:41.561 --> 07:43.229
THAT BROUGHT ME HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.597
BUT I CAN ALREADY FEEL

07:44.631 --> 07:46.299
THAT WE'RE ALREADY
SHOOTING OURSELVES IN THE FOOT.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.336
- WE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.208
- OH, HI.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.676
- THIS IS MY CLIENT, PASSION.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.111
PASSION CHO.
- HI, BEAUTIFUL.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.046
WE HAVE SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT
I WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.015
250 BOWER.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.216
SINCE I DON'T HAVE
AN OFFERING PLAN,

08:03.249 --> 08:05.585
I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU
VERY LIMITED INFORMATION.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.421
IS THERE A SPECIFIC LINE?
IS THERE A SPECIFIC SIZE?

08:08.455 --> 08:11.324
- I WANT ONE FOR ME
AND ONE FOR INVESTMENT.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.892
- OH, OKAY.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.094
GOOD CLIENT TO HAVE.
[both laugh]

08:14.127 --> 08:16.296
I'M NOT SHOWING 250 BOWERY

08:16.329 --> 08:18.865
BEFORE THE OFFERING PLAN
IS APPROVED.

08:18.898 --> 08:22.202
BUT I'VE BEEN WORKING LIKE CRAZY
AND MEETING A LOT OF BROKERS.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.737
- NICE.
- I LIKE THIS.

08:23.770 --> 08:24.838
- RIGHT?
- THIS IS GREAT.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.039
- LEAKING INFORMATION.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.508
OKAY, YEAH, FILE THAT
AMENDMENT, THANK YOU.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.744
MY GOAL IS TO HAVE THIS BUILDING
SO HYPED UP

08:30.777 --> 08:32.846
THAT WHEN THE OFFERING PLAN
IS APPROVED,

08:32.879 --> 08:34.914
I'LL HAVE HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS OF BUYERS.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.149
I NEED ALL OF YOUR HELP.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.384
- WHAT DO WE NEED?

08:37.417 --> 08:39.419
- SERIOUSLY,
START SENDING OUT NOTES NOW.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.187
YOU, I NEED AN AD.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.289
I ALSO WANT THE P.R. COMPANY
ALERTED ABOUT THIS.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.125
- DEFINITELY.
- GREAT.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.192
THANK YOU, GUYS.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.294
OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.069
- SO I'LL HAVE MY ASSISTANT
REACH OUT TO YOU VIA EMAIL.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.804
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU, MAN.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.773
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BYE.
[hangs up phone]

08:59.806 --> 09:00.907
- RYAN.
- HEY, MAN.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.610
JOHN AND I HAVE WORKED TOGETHER
MULTIPLE TIMES.

09:03.643 --> 09:06.212
HE'S BOUGHT A LOT
OF PROPERTIES IN THIS CITY

09:06.246 --> 09:07.681
AS INVESTMENTS.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.015
I MEAN, A LOT.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.151
SO I WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT I'M HIS BROKER

09:11.184 --> 09:13.186
ON EVERY TRANSACTION.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.388
THANKS FOR COMING BY.
- YEAH, NO WORRIES.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.123
- AND HE'S CURRENTLY LOOKING
FOR A ONE BEDROOM

09:17.157 --> 09:19.225
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF 750,000.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.561
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

09:21.594 --> 09:24.130
WE'RE BUSY. THE MARKET IS--
IT'S NUTSO.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.433
A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE SAW,
LIKE THAT THING ON ELIZABETH--

09:26.466 --> 09:28.134
IT'S GONE.
- REALLY.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.269
- IT WAS ON THE MARKET
FOR TWO DAYS.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.570
- TWO DAYS?
- YEAH.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.572
AND SO NOW WE KIND OF LOOK
AT NEW THINGS.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.207
BUT WE HAVE, YOU KNOW,
COMING UP,

09:34.240 --> 09:35.508
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER
FROM MY OFFICE HERE,

09:35.542 --> 09:36.876
IS 56 LEONARD.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.144
IT'LL BE
A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE,

09:38.178 --> 09:41.047
BUT I THINK THE APPRECIATION
IS DEFINITELY THERE.

09:41.047 --> 09:44.117
- WHAT ABOUT 250 BOWERY?

09:44.150 --> 09:45.285
- OH, GOD.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.820
THAT'S FREDRIK'S NEW BUILDING.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.222
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO BUILD
ALL THIS BUZZ RECENTLY

09:49.255 --> 09:51.658
BY RELEASING ALL OF THIS PRESS.

09:51.691 --> 09:55.495
AND EVERYBODY'S TALKING
ABOUT IT.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.529
- 250 BOWERY.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.064
- [man over speaker]
250 BOWERY?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.766
- THE PROBLEM IS

09:59.799 --> 10:03.103
IF I WERE TO GUESS,
JUST GUESS,

10:03.136 --> 10:05.672
I AM PROBABLY
THE LEAST LIKELY PERSON

10:05.705 --> 10:08.441
THAT FREDRIK WOULD WANT
TO DO BUSINESS WITH.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.909
- I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.144
I'VE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS
TALK ABOUT THE PLACE.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.379
- REALLY?
- AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.513
- IF YOU LIKE THAT AREA,

10:13.546 --> 10:14.748
ACTUALLY THERE'S
A REALLY COOL BUILDING

10:14.781 --> 10:16.049
ON RIDGE STREET.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.417
LIKE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO
LOWER EAST SIDE,

10:17.450 --> 10:18.985
WHERE EVERYONE-- LIKE,
KUSHNER'S BEEN GOING THERE.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.754
TRUMP. EVERYONE'S JUST BEEN
BUYING UP THE LOWER EAST SIDE.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.123
- I DON'T KNOW, I'M REALLY,
REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS AREA.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.958
I MEAN, IT'S DEFINITELY
AN UP-AND-COMING NEIGHBORHOOD.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.227
I THINK THAT THAT POCKET
IS A GREAT POCKET

10:27.260 --> 10:28.361
FOR INVESTMENT.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.764
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TO GET IN THERE?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.432
- UM, COOL.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.367
SO THAT ONE.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.735
I ACTUALLY--
I KNOW THE BROKER.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.570
WHO'S, YOU KNOW, BRINGING IT
TO THE MARKET.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.639
SO, SO, I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
TO GET US IN EARLY.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.675
- LET ME KNOW.
SOONER THE BETTER.

10:41.708 --> 10:42.842
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS, MAN.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.210
- APPRECIATE IT.
- SEE YOU.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.746
SHOOT ME.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.868
- OLIVIA, CAN YOU GIVE ME
FREDRIK'S NUMBER, PLEASE?

11:08.902 --> 11:10.337
- FREDRIK?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.871
- PLEASE, JUST GIVE ME HIS
NUMBER BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.374
DO I WANT TO IMPROVE
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH FREDRIK?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.409
NO.
I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.078
DON'T TELL ANY OTHER BROKERS
HERE I GAVE YOU MY CARD, THOUGH,

11:18.078 --> 11:19.412
BECAUSE--NOT AT THEIR PARTY.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.747
- I WANT YOU TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.115
- THIS IS [bleep] RIDICULOUS.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.516
BUT IT'S MY JOB
TO SELL APARTMENTS.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.085
THANK YOU.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.687
I WONDER HOW MANY
GAS STATION BATHROOMS

11:27.721 --> 11:29.255
THIS NUMBER IS WRITTEN ON.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.790
[line rings]
[clears throat]

11:30.824 --> 11:32.659
OH! I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS!

11:32.692 --> 11:35.895
[exhales]

11:35.929 --> 11:37.797
[whispering]
OH, MAN.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.300
[line rings]

11:40.333 --> 11:42.635
[whispering]
DON'T PICK UP, DON'T PICK UP...

11:42.669 --> 11:46.006
[line rings]

11:46.106 --> 11:48.842
- HEY, FREDRIK, IT'S RYAN
FROM NEST SEEKERS.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.244
HOW ARE YOU?

11:51.277 --> 11:54.714
HELLO?

12:00.186 --> 12:02.288
- OH, MY GOD.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.558
- YEE-AH.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.328
I HAVE A BUYER
WHO IS INTERESTED

12:08.361 --> 12:10.730
IN 250 BOWERY, AND, UM,

12:10.764 --> 12:14.668
I WANT TO MEET WITH YOU
ABOUT IT.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.317
I UNDERSTAND.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.819
I JUST WANT TO SEE
IF THERE'S SOME WAY

12:32.852 --> 12:33.853
THAT WE COULD WORK TOGETHER

12:33.887 --> 12:36.322
JUST AS TWO BROKERS.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.092
NOT TAKING ANYTHING ELSE
INTO CONSIDERATION.

12:45.131 --> 12:48.635
- OH, GOD!

12:48.668 --> 12:50.236
HATE THAT GUY!

12:50.270 --> 12:52.639
CAN YOU EMAIL HIM?
I DON'T WANNA EMAIL HIM.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.474
FREDRIK IS GONNA BE
A TOTAL DICK.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.709
AND IT'S GONNA SUCK.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.778
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO
SWALLOW MY PRIDE.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.247
BUT THAT IS THE ONLY THING
THAT I WILL SWALLOW.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.217
OH! OH, I FEEL GROSS.

13:11.858 --> 13:12.826
- SEÑORITA.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.160
- HELLO.
- HOW ARE YOU?

13:14.194 --> 13:16.396
YOU LOOK AMAZING
TO CONCENTRATE.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.832
- MY CO-LISTER ANTONIA
PRICED THIS APARTMENT TOO HIGH.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.800
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.102
MY JOB, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

13:22.135 --> 13:24.637
IS TO MAKE SURE
THE CLIENTS ARE PLEASED.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.573
AND SINCE JEWEL IS AN ACTRESS,

13:26.606 --> 13:28.608
I CAME UP WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.709
LET'S MAKE A MOVIE.

13:29.743 --> 13:32.178
ALL RIGHT!

13:32.212 --> 13:35.148
USUALLY BROKERS MAKE
VERY CHEESY LISTING VIDEO.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.851
BUT THIS APARTMENT IS
AN ULTRA LUXURY APARTMENT.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.086
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER
TO CREATE A REAL FILM

13:40.086 --> 13:41.287
WITH SUBSTANCE.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.455
SOMETHING SOPHISTICATED.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.890
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.291
BEFORE I GOT INTO REAL ESTATE,

13:45.325 --> 13:46.693
I CAME TO NEW YORK CITY
TO GO TO FILM SCHOOL.

13:46.726 --> 13:49.295
AND I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED
TO FIND A WAY

13:49.329 --> 13:51.998
TO COMBINE BOTH FILM
AND REAL ESTATE TOGETHER.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.200
FOLLOW ME FOR ONE S--
SO YOU'RE HERE.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.002
I NEED TO GET THE BROKERS
VERY EXCITED,

13:56.102 --> 14:00.306
AND THAT'S WHY I USED THEM
AS PART OF MY CAST.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.042
- YEAH, LET HER LEAD YOU.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.576
IF THEY'RE EXCITED,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.178
THEY'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT THIS ALL OVER TOWN.

14:05.211 --> 14:08.615
GUYS, THANK YOU--
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.050
I'M GONNA BE VERY BRIEF.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.886
THE IDEA IS EVERYBODY'S HERE
ON A HOUSEWARMING PARTY

14:12.919 --> 14:14.621
THAT THIS COUPLE,
JEWEL AND JACOB,

14:14.654 --> 14:16.156
THEY JUST BOUGHT THIS APARTMENT.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.558
AND THE IDEA IS TO ACTUALLY SHOW
THE HOUSE THAT WE'RE SELLING.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.593
[popular jazz music]

14:20.627 --> 14:23.063
CAN YOU GET ME SOME SPACE THERE,
NICOLE?

14:23.063 --> 14:24.097
AND ACTION.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.265
LOOK AT HER.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.466
YOU SEE HOW SHE LOOKS?
YOU SEE THAT FACE?

14:26.499 --> 14:27.500
OKAY, THERE YOU GO!

14:27.534 --> 14:28.568
I LOVE IT. CUT.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.769
THAT WAS AMAZING.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.571
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. ACTION!

14:31.604 --> 14:32.772
CUT. ALL RIGHT, CUT.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.674
CUT. AND ACTION.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.343
AND ACTION. ACTION.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.211
ACTION. CUT, CUT, CUT,
CUT, CUT.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.146
I'M SORRY, SORRY.
MY MISTAKE, MY MISTAKE.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.848
ONE MORE TIME, LET'S GO.
SAME THING, SAME THING.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.083
I'VE DECIDED TO BE
THE CAMERAMAN,

14:43.083 --> 14:44.918
THE PRODUCER, THE DIRECTOR,

14:44.951 --> 14:47.253
THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.
NO!

14:47.287 --> 14:49.456
I RAN OUT OF MEMORY.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.791
WOW! THAT WAS PERFECT! AMAZING.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.960
SO I HAVE TO WEAR
A HUNDRED THOUSAND HATS.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.730
[sighs]
AND THAT IS A LOT OF WORK.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.131
THAT IS A LOT OF WORK.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.366
MY BACK IS KILLING ME.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.700
[sighs]

15:00.734 --> 15:01.735
LET'S DO IT ONE MORE TIME.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.470
BUT "PASSION!"

15:03.503 --> 15:05.205
[all laugh]

15:05.238 --> 15:07.607
AND ACTION.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.848
[car horn tooting]

15:14.881 --> 15:15.949
IN THE PAST WEEK,

15:16.049 --> 15:17.217
I'VE GONE OVER
THE PRELIMINARY PRICING

15:17.250 --> 15:18.752
WITH ZACH.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.254
HI. I'M FREDRIK.
NICE TO MEET YOU. MWAH!

15:21.287 --> 15:22.288
AND EVER SINCE THEN,
I'VE MET

15:22.322 --> 15:23.923
WITH HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.425
HI, I'M FREDRIK.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.660
EVEN TODAY, I'M MEETING
MORE PEOPLE.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.696
INCLUDING RYAN.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.764
- HEY.
- HI, RYAN.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.065
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.900
FREDRIK HAS AGREED
TO MEET WITH ME.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.770
SO I'M GONNA GET ALL THE INFO
THAT I CAN FOR MY BUYERS.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.772
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, PRICES.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.874
AND I'M GONNA BE
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.842
- THANKS, ALL OF YOU,
FOR COMING.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.244
THIS IS THE BUILDING.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.446
BOWERY. 24 UNITS.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.148
ALL GLASS.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.417
- WHAT ARE THE SIZES
OF THE ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS?

15:50.450 --> 15:53.119
- THEY START ACTUALLY
AROUND 550 SQUARE FEET.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.988
- FOR A ONE-BEDROOM?
- CORRECT.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.589
- COULD YOU HAVE MADE
THE BEDROOM A LITTLE BIT BIGGER

15:56.623 --> 15:58.191
BY NOT HAVING SUCH A BIG CLOSET?

15:58.224 --> 16:00.794
- NO, BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SELL
THESE APARTMENTS

16:00.827 --> 16:01.828
ON ABSOLUTE PRICE POINT.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.163
- WHAT PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT
IS THAT?

16:03.196 --> 16:05.265
- I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU A PRICE
PER SQUARE FOOT

16:05.298 --> 16:06.800
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.501
WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFERING PLAN
APPROVED YET, RIGHT?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.570
SO I CAN'T LEGALLY SELL
ANYTHING TO YOU.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.805
- DO YOU HAVE A RANGE THOUGH?

16:11.838 --> 16:13.039
'CAUSE I'M JUST THINKING...

16:13.039 --> 16:15.875
- THEY'RE GONNA RANGE
FROM $700,000

16:15.909 --> 16:18.044
UP TO ABOUT 5 MILLION
OR 6 MILLION. RANGES.

16:18.044 --> 16:21.348
- THESE RANGES SURPRISING FIT IN
TO MOST OF MY CLIENTS' BUDGET.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.149
ESPECIALLY JOHN'S.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.486
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT HIGH
AT 1,300 A FOOT,

16:26.519 --> 16:29.322
WHEN MOST OF THE BOWERY IS
AT 1,100 A FOOT.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.391
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S DOABLE.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.525
HOW MANY OF YOU THINK
YOU HAVE BUYERS

16:32.559 --> 16:34.094
FOR THIS BUILDING ALREADY?

16:34.127 --> 16:36.196
- WE ALL DO.
- YOU ALL DO?

16:36.229 --> 16:37.797
- THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
- EVERYONE HAS A BUYER?

16:37.831 --> 16:38.832
- MM-HMM.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.268
- WELL, ON THAT NOTE, UM...

16:42.302 --> 16:44.337
IT'S A BIT OF AN UNCOMFORTABLE
SITUATION FOR ME,

16:44.371 --> 16:49.175
UM, BECAUSE WE HAVE 750 PEOPLE
ON A WAITING LIST.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.944
- 750 PEOPLE?

16:50.977 --> 16:53.513
750 PEOPLE?

16:53.546 --> 16:55.715
- AND WE ONLY HAVE 24 UNITS.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.484
IN MY TEN-YEAR CAREER, I'VE
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.486
I MEAN BOWERY'S VERY HOT,
THE ARCHITECT'S HOT.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.920
I'M GOOD.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.722
WHEN YOU'RE
THE DIRECTOR OF SALES

17:02.756 --> 17:04.724
FOR A WHOLE BUILDING,

17:04.758 --> 17:06.659
YOU'RE REALLY THE HIGHEST FORM
OF A BROKER.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.261
DING!

17:08.294 --> 17:10.597
BECAUSE YOU PICK WHO YOU'RE
GONNA SELL THESE UNITS TO.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.099
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE A DOORMAN
IN A REALLY HOT CLUB

17:13.133 --> 17:14.701
WITH A LONG LINE OF PEOPLE.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.504
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OKAY,
YOU, YOU, NOT YOU."

17:17.537 --> 17:18.938
- IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO

17:19.039 --> 17:21.875
TO MAKE OUR BUYERS
MORE ATTRACTIVE TO YOU

17:21.908 --> 17:23.643
THAN, SAY THE OTHER 700?

17:23.677 --> 17:25.045
- I LIKE THAT QUESTION.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.147
- YOU DON'T WANT ANY PRESENTS
OR ANYTHING?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.882
- [laughs]
- THAT'S AN INTERESTING THOUGHT.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.717
I MEAN, WE'VE HAD
OUR DIFFERENCES.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.421
IT'D BE INTERESTING TO SEE
HOW MUCH YOU WANT THE BUILDING.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.856
FREDRIK IS UNBELIEVABLE.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.427
HE'S GOING TO LORD THESE UNITS
OVER THESE AGENTS

17:40.460 --> 17:43.830
SO THAT WE BEG AND SQUIRM
TO GET ON HIS PRECIOUS LIST.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.498
ARE WE GOOD?
- THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.733
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

17:46.766 --> 17:47.801
- I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING
THIS DESPICABLE

17:47.834 --> 17:50.170
SINCE THE LAST THING
FREDRIK DID.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.638
- A PLEASURE
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.239
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, RYAN.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.442
- LOOKING FORWARD TO THE EMAIL.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.277
- COMING UP...
- LISTEN TO ME NOW.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.678
THERE'S ONE THING
THAT YOU COULD DO

17:58.712 --> 18:01.915
WHICH WILL MAKE ME CONSIDER
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

18:11.358 --> 18:14.127
- HEY, LUKE.
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.029
HEY, SARA, IT'S RYAN.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.798
HEY, STEFANO,
IT'S RYAN SERHANT.

18:18.832 --> 18:19.799
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
AN UPDATE

18:19.833 --> 18:21.835
ON 250 BOWERY.

18:21.868 --> 18:22.936
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

18:23.036 --> 18:24.304
AFTER MY MEETING
AT FREDRIK'S OFFICE,

18:24.337 --> 18:26.272
I SENT ALL OF MY CLIENTS
THE PRICING AND SPECS

18:26.306 --> 18:27.440
OF 250 BOWERY.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.643
THE RANGE OF PRICES
HAS BEEN SET ALREADY.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.946
AND, YOU KNOW, IT MAY CHANGE
A LITTLE BIT,

18:33.046 --> 18:34.447
JUST 'CAUSE THERE'S
SO MUCH INTEREST,

18:34.481 --> 18:36.049
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'LL ONLY
CHANGE, LIKE, A COUPLE PERCENT.

18:36.082 --> 18:39.052
AND I WANT TO MEET
WITH JOHN SPECIFICALLY,

18:39.085 --> 18:40.253
BECAUSE HE'S
A VERY IMPORTANT CLIENT FOR ME.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.822
- RYAN.
- HEY, MAN.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.592
BUT I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO HIM
THE CHALLENGES INVOLVED.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.260
WHICH ARE,
FREDRIK'S A COCKHOLE.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.962
I WANNA KICK HIM IN THE LEG.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.865
SO, UM, I JUST WANTED
TO TOUCH BASE WITH YOU BRIEFLY.

18:51.898 --> 18:55.068
TRYING TO GET YOU
INTO 250 BOWERY.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.237
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW--
IT'S GOING OKAY.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.673
FREDRIK THE BROKER...
- UH-HUH.

18:59.706 --> 19:05.445
- HAS A WAIT LIST
THAT'S OVER 700 PEOPLE.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.047
- I'M AN INVESTOR.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.783
NOW THAT YOU TELL ME THERE'S
OVER 700 PEOPLE LOOKING AT IT,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.818
I THINK THAT COULD BE
A GOOD THING, DON'T YOU THINK?

19:11.851 --> 19:14.020
THAT MEANS I'M GONNA MAKE
MY MONEY LATER ON,

19:14.054 --> 19:15.321
I CAN SELL IT AT ANY POINT.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.790
AND THERE'S STILL GONNA BE
A HIGH INTEREST.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.725
- RIGHT.
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.662
- UM, BUT THERE'S JUST
A LOT OF COMPETITION.

19:22.696 --> 19:24.230
- I THOUGHT YOU CAN ACTUALLY
GET THINGS DONE.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.632
WHAT--WHAT'S UP?

19:25.665 --> 19:26.766
I MEAN, SHOULD I JUST GO
TO FREDRIK?

19:26.800 --> 19:27.801
[stammers] I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.402
- [groans]

19:29.436 --> 19:30.870
THAT'S THE LAST THING I NEED.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.672
NO, BECAUSE HE HAS--
HE HAS

19:32.706 --> 19:35.141
A "WHO WOULD YOU BE"
TO THE OTHER 700 PEOPLE

19:35.175 --> 19:36.509
THAT HE HAS ON THE LIST?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.211
SO THE BEST WAY
TO GET IN THERE

19:38.244 --> 19:42.048
IS FOR ME LITERALLY
TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.550
SO THIS ISN'T--
IT'S NOT BAD NEWS.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.452
IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST A SPEED BUMP.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.586
I'LL GET YOU IN.
- YOU'RE SURE?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.054
- I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU--
YEAH, 100%

19:48.054 --> 19:49.356
I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN HIM
FOR A LONG TIME.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.658
WE HAVE--WE HAVE HISTORY.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.193
- THAT'S GOOD.
I LIKE IT.

19:53.226 --> 19:57.063
- OKAY.

20:03.103 --> 20:04.070
- DANIEL?

20:04.104 --> 20:05.171
- TELL ME.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.906
- CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH THE, UH,

20:06.940 --> 20:09.676
WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF THE OPEN HOUSE?

20:09.709 --> 20:10.810
- WHAT IS THAT?

20:10.844 --> 20:11.845
- THE MOVIE.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.213
AFTER I SHOT THE FILM,

20:13.246 --> 20:14.347
I CUT IT DOWN INTO A TRAILER,

20:14.381 --> 20:15.882
AND I SENT IT TO EVERYBODY,

20:15.915 --> 20:18.251
THOSE WHO WERE PART OF THE FILM
AND THOSE WHO WEREN'T.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.519
I'M ACTUALLY NERVOUS, MAN.
- WHY IS THAT?

20:19.552 --> 20:20.553
- I DON'T THINK I HAVE SHOWN

20:20.587 --> 20:23.023
A FILM IN--
SINCE, LIKE, 2006.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.358
AND TODAY, I AM DOING
AN OPEN HOUSE

20:25.392 --> 20:27.293
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PREMIERE
THE FILM

20:27.327 --> 20:28.762
THAT EVERYBODY
HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

20:28.795 --> 20:29.929
SHOULD WE PUT THIS HERE?

20:29.963 --> 20:32.165
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO WALK
THE RED CARPET,

20:32.198 --> 20:33.533
TAKE PICTURES.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.301
THERE'S GOING TO BE POPCORN,
GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.070
- LUIS!
- OH, MY GOD, OH.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.205
- HELLO!
- IDENTIFICATION, PLEASE.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.508
SO IT'LL CREATE AN AUTOMATIC
FEELING OF EXCITEMENT.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.176
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
THE PEOPLE

20:43.209 --> 20:45.645
IN YOUR OPEN HOUSE TO BE--
EXCITED.

20:45.679 --> 20:48.515
[swingy music]

20:48.548 --> 20:50.316
AMAZING, AMAZING.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.518
AMAZING.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.719
SO YOU SAY YOU HAD A BUYER
ALSO COMING TODAY?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.754
- YEAH, IF HE'S COMING.
- OKAY.

20:54.788 --> 20:55.955
ALL RIGHT, NOW, EVERYBODY,

20:55.989 --> 20:57.857
THANK YOU VERY,
VERY MUCH FOR COMING.

20:57.891 --> 20:59.726
YOU'RE ABOUT TO ACTUALLY SEE
A VERY GOOD MOVIE.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.894
THE IDEA IS FOR YOU GUYS

21:00.927 --> 21:02.328
TO PASS THIS ALONG
TO YOUR BUYERS,

21:02.362 --> 21:04.264
THOSE WHO CAN'T COME,
THE CHINESE INVESTORS

21:04.297 --> 21:05.565
WHO DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TRAVEL DOWN HERE.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.201
SO EVERYBODY HAS CHAMPAGNE.
LET'S PLAY IT.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.269
ALL RIGHT.
[laughter]

21:09.302 --> 21:12.072
[dramatic violin music]

21:12.105 --> 21:19.946
* *

21:50.110 --> 21:52.112
[applause]

21:56.182 --> 21:58.852
GRACIAS, EH?
I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER

21:58.885 --> 21:59.853
WITH EVERYBODY'S REACTION.

21:59.886 --> 22:00.920
EVERYBODY HAS ENJOYED IT.

22:00.954 --> 22:01.955
EVERYBODY WAS SMILING.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.189
SO BRING THIS TO YOUR BUYERS.

22:03.223 --> 22:04.391
LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THIS
IS ON THE MARKET,

22:04.424 --> 22:06.292
THAT THIS IS HOTTER
THAN A [bleep] PANCAKE,

22:06.326 --> 22:08.661
AND THE--
[laughs]

22:08.695 --> 22:10.463
LET ME SHOW YOU THE REST
OF THE APARTMENT.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.931
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.

22:14.501 --> 22:15.769
- YOU CAN EVEN SEE JUPITER.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.070
[laughter]
- JUPITER.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.805
- YOU CAN SEE ABSOLUTELY
EVERYTHING THERE IS TO SEE.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.073
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE PRICE?

22:20.073 --> 22:21.508
$9.25 MILLION,
YOU THINK IT'S FAIR?

22:21.541 --> 22:24.411
- UM, I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE HIGH.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.445
- I LOVE THE VIEWS.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.980
I LOVE THE APARTMENT.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.148
- OKAY.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.816
- I THINK THE PRICE IS
A LITTLE TOO HIGH.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.618
- OKAY, UNDERSTOOD.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.254
- BUT I DO FEEL THAT
WE CAN PUSH A LITTLE BIT,

22:34.287 --> 22:36.990
SINCE THIS IS
THE TOP FLOOR.

22:37.090 --> 22:38.591
- BESIDES THE FACT
THAT THE PREMIERE WAS GREAT,

22:38.625 --> 22:40.293
EVERYBODY KEPT ON AGREEING
ON THE SAME THING.

22:40.326 --> 22:42.328
THEY HATED THE PRICE.

22:44.698 --> 22:45.865
- I THINK SO TOO.

22:45.899 --> 22:48.635
- I KNEW THAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.638
[upbeat music]

22:51.671 --> 22:57.544
* *

22:57.577 --> 22:59.846
- MY CLIENTS WANT
250 BOWERY,

22:59.879 --> 23:02.882
AND FREDRIK IS
THE EXCLUSIVE AGENT,

23:02.916 --> 23:05.385
WHICH MEANS FREDRIK
HOLDS ALL THE CARDS.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.386
- HI.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.487
- HEY.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.655
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.056
SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN SOMEONE
IS HOLDING

23:10.090 --> 23:11.424
ALL THE CARDS?

23:11.458 --> 23:13.059
YOU PLAY NICE.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.961
YOU INFLATE THEIR EGO.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.730
IT'S ALL PART OF THE GAME.

23:16.763 --> 23:17.897
- DO YOU HAVE
GREEN TEA MATCHA?

23:17.931 --> 23:19.065
- [chuckles]

23:19.099 --> 23:20.500
I DON'T HAVE THAT
ON THE MENU, SIR.

23:20.533 --> 23:23.236
- IN THIS INDUSTRY,
YOU CAN'T DISCOUNT ANYONE.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.305
AND RIGHT NOW,
I HAPPEN TO HAVE SOMETHING

23:25.338 --> 23:26.439
THAT HE WANTS.

23:26.473 --> 23:28.775
BUT HE'S GOING TO HAVE
TO EARN IT.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.410
- SO I KNOW
YOU'RE VERY BUSY.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.878
- YEAH.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.482
- UM...

23:35.515 --> 23:36.816
UM...

23:36.850 --> 23:38.418
- YOU SEEM A LITTLE TENSE.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.954
- I WANT TO PUT EVERYTHING
ON THE TABLE,

23:40.987 --> 23:42.355
AND I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

23:42.389 --> 23:44.224
- APOLOGIZE?
- YEAH.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.359
FOR THE WAY THAT I'VE REACTED
AT YOUR OPEN HOUSES

23:46.393 --> 23:47.994
AND IF I'VE EMBARRASSED YOU.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.130
- IS THIS THE NEW
RYAN SERHANT

23:50.163 --> 23:51.731
THAT'S THE NICE ONE?

23:51.765 --> 23:53.166
- OH, NO, I'M ALWAYS NICE.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.467
I THINK I'M ALWAYS
JUST UNDER PRESSURE

23:54.501 --> 23:56.803
'CAUSE I TRY
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO...

23:56.836 --> 24:00.140
REACT AROUND BIGGER BROKERS
LIKE YOU.

24:00.173 --> 24:03.410
- YOU'RE CALLING ME
THE BIGGER BROKER.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.411
- YES.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.912
UGH!

24:05.945 --> 24:09.215
[gagging]

24:09.249 --> 24:11.551
- NOW, THIS I LIKE.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.819
SO--
- BUT YOU ARE.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.154
LOOK, I HAVE NO--
- RYAN, RYAN.

24:14.187 --> 24:15.255
- I HAVE NO--
- RYAN, LISTEN.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.123
NO OFFENSE TO YOU
TALKING RIGHT NOW,

24:17.157 --> 24:18.224
BUT WHAT IS THE POINT?

24:18.258 --> 24:20.593
- 250 BOWERY.
- OOH.

24:20.627 --> 24:23.329
- AND WHEN YOU'RE ABLE
TO START SELLING AT 250 BOWERY,

24:23.363 --> 24:25.565
I WANT TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE
CHANCE OF GETTING IN.

24:25.598 --> 24:29.402
- BUT, RYAN, SERIOUSLY,
WHY WOULD I DO THIS FOR YOU?

24:29.436 --> 24:32.105
YOU HATE ME.
WHY--THIS IS WEIRD.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.473
- I DON'T HATE YOU.
- NO?

24:33.506 --> 24:35.709
- I DON'T HATE YOU.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.913
HE'S DONE GAY PORN.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.147
- OH, MY GOD.

24:41.181 --> 24:42.349
NO, YOU HATE ME,

24:42.382 --> 24:43.683
BUT YOU LOVE THE COMMISSION

24:43.717 --> 24:44.984
THAT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
OFF OF ME.

24:45.085 --> 24:49.622
- NO, LOOK, I WANT TO MOVE
PAST ALL OF THAT.

24:49.656 --> 24:50.990
- LET'S PRETEND YOU AND I
ARE FRIENDS HERE.

24:51.091 --> 24:52.258
THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION.

24:52.292 --> 24:53.693
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU AND I
ARE GONNA SHAKE HANDS

24:53.727 --> 24:55.195
AND I'M GONNA NOW SAY
I'M SELLING YOU 250 BOWERY.

24:55.228 --> 24:57.530
I CANNOT LEGALLY DO THAT.
YOU KNOW THAT.

24:57.564 --> 24:58.665
- SO WHAT CAN YOU DO?

24:58.698 --> 25:00.433
- WHAT WE CAN LEAVE HERE IS,
YOU KNOW,

25:00.467 --> 25:01.468
TRY THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP.

25:01.501 --> 25:02.869
IT'S INTERESTING.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.171
AND THEN WE CAN SEE WHERE
IT'S GONNA LEAD US, SO...

25:05.205 --> 25:06.172
- SURE.

25:06.206 --> 25:09.876
- WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE
FOR ME?

25:09.909 --> 25:11.411
- I SUGGESTED LUNCH.
WE'RE HERE.

25:11.444 --> 25:12.946
LUNCH.

25:13.046 --> 25:16.316
- WHAT ABOUT...

25:16.349 --> 25:18.385
A DOUBLE DATE?

25:18.418 --> 25:19.652
THAT WOULD PROVE TO ME...
- NO.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.488
- THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.922
- YOU WANT TO GO
ON A DOUBLE DATE WITH ME?

25:22.956 --> 25:24.758
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO DO.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.593
RYAN HAS MADE AN EMBARRASSMENT
OF HIMSELF

25:26.626 --> 25:29.329
ON MANY OF MY OPEN HOUSES
AND EVENTS.

25:29.362 --> 25:32.499
SO BEFORE I BRING HIM
INTO BOWERY,

25:32.532 --> 25:33.633
I'M GOING TO TEST HIM OUT.

25:33.667 --> 25:34.768
IS HE SINCERE?

25:34.801 --> 25:35.769
YOU'RE ASKING ME
FOR BIG FAVORS.

25:35.802 --> 25:38.672
NOW LIVE UP TO IT.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.173
DO YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT?
YOU WANNA EMAIL ME?

25:40.206 --> 25:41.608
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.

25:41.641 --> 25:45.512
- OKAY.
LISTEN TO ME, NOW.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.947
THERE'S ONE THING
THAT YOU COULD DO RIGHT NOW

25:47.981 --> 25:51.184
WHICH WILL MAKE ME
CONSIDER...

25:51.217 --> 25:55.822
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.758
[upbeat music]

25:58.792 --> 26:00.493
[horns beeping]

26:00.527 --> 26:06.399
* *

26:06.433 --> 26:08.668
- MM.

26:08.702 --> 26:09.669
- HEY!

26:09.703 --> 26:11.771
- ANTONIA, HOW ARE YOU?

26:11.805 --> 26:12.906
- FANTASTIC.
- CAN'T GIVE YOU MY HANDS

26:12.939 --> 26:14.274
'CAUSE I GOT ORANGE--
MWAH!

26:14.307 --> 26:16.142
BUT I CAN GIVE YOU MY LIPS.

26:16.176 --> 26:17.811
- SO WE HAVE AN OFFER
FOR THE PENTHOUSE

26:17.844 --> 26:19.112
AT 220 RIVERSIDE.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.647

26:20.680 --> 26:22.582
ALL CASH,
TWO WEEKS CLOSING,

26:22.615 --> 26:25.085
$7 MILLION.

26:25.118 --> 26:27.454
- $7 MILLION IS
A PHENOMENAL OFFER

26:27.487 --> 26:29.456
FOR THIS APARTMENT,
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT

26:29.489 --> 26:31.891
I PREDICTED THIS APARTMENT
SHOULD BE LISTED AT.

26:31.925 --> 26:33.960
BUT JEWEL IS NOT GOING
TO BE HAPPY

26:34.060 --> 26:36.629
BECAUSE ANTONIA
GOT HER HOPES UP.

26:36.663 --> 26:39.065
[line ringing]

26:40.600 --> 26:43.269
- HOW IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
ACTRESS IN TOWN?

26:43.303 --> 26:46.239
[laughter]

26:46.272 --> 26:49.275
- SO NOW, SOMEHOW,
WE HAVE TO CONVINCE HER

26:49.309 --> 26:51.745
THAT THIS OFFER IS A VERY GOOD
GODDAMN OFFER.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.381
SO I'M HERE WITH ANTONIA,
AND WE'RE HERE IN THE OFFICE.

26:54.414 --> 26:56.282
SHE JUST BROKE
SOME GOOD NEWS TO ME.

26:56.316 --> 26:59.185
- SO, JEWEL,
AN ALL-CASH OFFER...

26:59.219 --> 27:00.353
- AND IT'S GOOD.

27:00.387 --> 27:02.355
- ABLE TO CLOSE
IN TWO WEEKS OR LESS,

27:02.389 --> 27:04.791

27:04.824 --> 27:07.560
- BOOM.

27:12.032 --> 27:15.135
- YOU'RE THAT EXCITED?

27:18.705 --> 27:20.707
- IT IS A GOOD OFFER, JEWEL.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.688
- MY HONEST BELIEF
IS THAT OFFERS LIKE THIS

27:34.721 --> 27:37.857
ARE NOT GONNA COME
THAT OFTEN.

27:37.891 --> 27:38.958
PEOPLE ARE GONNA FEEL
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY UNABLE

27:39.059 --> 27:39.959
TO SELL AT THE PRICE
WE'RE ASKING.

27:40.060 --> 27:41.294
- YES.
- THEY'RE GONNA COME IN

27:41.327 --> 27:42.729
AT 5.5 MILLION,
5.8 MILLION.

27:59.579 --> 28:01.147
- LISTEN TO ME, NOW.

28:01.181 --> 28:03.917
THERE'S ONE THING THAT YOU
COULD DO RIGHT NOW.

28:04.017 --> 28:06.720
- WHAT IS IT?

28:06.753 --> 28:08.054
- I WANT YOU TO HIGH-KICK.

28:08.088 --> 28:09.622
- WHAT?

28:09.656 --> 28:11.424
- I HIGH-KICK ALL THE TIME.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.559
- WHERE--
WHY WOULD YOU WANT ME--

28:12.592 --> 28:13.927
JUST TO SEE ME DO
A HIGH KICK?

28:14.027 --> 28:15.595
- WHY DO YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
WHY I'M ASKING YOU?

28:15.628 --> 28:17.831
IT WOULD JUST GIVE ME
IMMENSE PLEASURE

28:17.864 --> 28:20.333
TO SEE YOU HIGH-KICK.

28:20.367 --> 28:22.135
- OKAY. OKAY, SURE.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.838
I KNEW MEETING FREDRIK
WASN'T JUST GONNA BE

28:24.871 --> 28:27.273
A LITTLE LUNCH, GREAT,
HANDSHAKE, LET'S GO.

28:27.307 --> 28:28.375
- COME ON.
COME HERE.

28:28.408 --> 28:29.542
- OH, MY GOD.

28:29.576 --> 28:32.312
HE NEEDS TO TERRORIZE
AND TORTURE PEOPLE

28:32.345 --> 28:35.215
IN ORDER FOR HIM TO FEEL
POSITIVE ABOUT HIS DAY.

28:35.248 --> 28:36.950
- WHEE!

28:37.050 --> 28:40.720
THINK ABOUT THE COMMISSIONS
AT 250 BOWERY.

28:40.754 --> 28:42.055
- [clears throat]

28:42.088 --> 28:43.790
I DON'T THINK I CAN--

28:43.823 --> 28:45.225
- STRAIGHT TOE, STRAIGHT.
- STRAIGHT TOE?

28:45.258 --> 28:48.061
- STRAIGHT.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.063
- MM.

28:50.063 --> 28:51.831
- DON'T FORGET THE HANDS.
DINOSAUR HANDS.

28:51.865 --> 28:53.967

28:54.067 --> 28:55.802
- COMMISSION, 250 BOWERY.

28:58.304 --> 29:01.041
[tense music]

29:01.074 --> 29:02.876
* *

29:02.909 --> 29:03.877
- WHEE!

29:03.910 --> 29:06.146
- [cackling]

29:06.179 --> 29:07.614
- WAS IT GOOD?

29:07.647 --> 29:09.115
WAS IT THAT GOOD?

29:09.149 --> 29:11.017
- OH, MY GOD.

29:11.017 --> 29:12.852
THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
HILARIOUS MOMENTS.

29:12.886 --> 29:15.021
I'M JUST GONNA CLOSE MY EYES
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE

29:15.021 --> 29:18.024
AND SEE IT HAPPENING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

29:18.058 --> 29:22.028
- [roaring in slow motion]

29:22.028 --> 29:24.164
- I MEAN, HILARIOUS.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.466
THANK YOU FOR LUNCH.
I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE PAYING.

29:26.499 --> 29:27.667
- YEAH, NO, I GOT THIS.

29:27.701 --> 29:29.602
- YOU GOTTA PRACTICE
ON THAT KICK, THOUGH.

29:29.636 --> 29:30.804
- I WILL.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.739
- AM I GONNA SELL RYAN UNITS
AT 250 BOWERY?

29:32.772 --> 29:33.940
MAYBE.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.444
BUT WE'LL SEE HOW HE DOES
ON THE DATE.

29:37.477 --> 29:40.914
- I'M A WHORE.
I'M A WHORE.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.048
- COMING UP...

29:42.082 --> 29:43.383
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL
ANYTHING TO ME

29:43.416 --> 29:46.052
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.794
- SO WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE LUNCH?

29:54.828 --> 29:56.629
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEFORE WE HAVE LUNCH,

29:56.663 --> 29:59.766
I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU
A CLIENT'S APARTMENT.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.635
IT'S RIGHT HERE.
- OKAY.

30:02.669 --> 30:05.605
[techno music]

30:05.638 --> 30:07.340
* *

30:07.374 --> 30:08.808
- QUITE A BIG SPACE, NO?

30:08.842 --> 30:10.643
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
LOTS OF LIGHT.

30:10.677 --> 30:12.212
- I MEAN, IT'S BEING
RENOVATED NOW.

30:12.245 --> 30:14.447
YOU KNOW, THE FLOORS
ARE GONNA BE INCREDIBLE.

30:14.481 --> 30:15.682
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S NICE.

30:15.715 --> 30:16.683
[phone rings]

30:16.716 --> 30:19.819
- WAIT.

30:19.853 --> 30:24.624
FREDRIK EKLUND RESIDENCE.

30:24.657 --> 30:26.626
YES?

30:26.659 --> 30:28.728
OKAY.

30:28.762 --> 30:30.430
SO I HAVE--

30:30.463 --> 30:33.667
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

30:33.700 --> 30:36.269
WE LIVE HERE.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.271
- WHOA.
- [laughs]

30:38.304 --> 30:41.041
- IT'S NOT A JOKE?
- NO, I'M NOT JOKING.

30:41.074 --> 30:42.809
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S PERFECT.
I LOVE IT.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.277
- SO LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.613
- WOW, LET'S SEE THE BEDROOM.

30:46.646 --> 30:48.048
- CHING-CHING!

30:55.922 --> 30:57.323
- THE LOBBY,
WHICH IS GREAT

30:57.357 --> 30:58.558
BECAUSE WE'RE PUTTING
A LOT OF FOCUS

30:58.591 --> 30:59.959
ON THE 24-HOUR DOORMAN.

31:00.060 --> 31:01.361
WE'RE JUST DAYS AWAY
FROM HAVING

31:01.394 --> 31:04.064
THE OFFERING PLAN APPROVED
AT 250 BOWERY.

31:04.064 --> 31:05.665
I MEAN, PEOPLE THINK
THIS IS A PHOTO,

31:05.699 --> 31:07.100
BUT IT'S A COMPUTER RENDERING.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.735
- THAT'S GREAT.
- AND THE DAY IT DOES,

31:08.768 --> 31:11.338
I'M GONNA HAVE A BIG PARTY
VERY CLOSE TO THE BUILDING,

31:11.371 --> 31:14.207
WHERE I'M GOING TO RELEASE
THE FINAL PRICING.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.443
IN THE MEANTIME,
IT'S JUST WORK, WORK, WORK.

31:16.476 --> 31:19.579
- SO HOW ARE WE LOOKING
FOR THE PARTY?

31:19.612 --> 31:21.481
- I'M HOPING THAT I'M GONNA BE
ABLE TO BRING PEOPLE

31:21.514 --> 31:23.116
UP IN THE BUILDING
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.585
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
TRYING TO GET INTO THIS PARTY,

31:25.618 --> 31:26.953
AND IT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE BIT OF CHAOS.

31:26.986 --> 31:31.124
NOW WE HAVE 850 BUYERS
ON THIS INTEREST LIST.

31:31.157 --> 31:32.625
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

31:32.659 --> 31:34.227
- IF THERE'S 850 PEOPLE
ON A WAITING LIST,

31:34.260 --> 31:36.296
DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD START
WITH, UH,

31:36.329 --> 31:37.831
TRYING TO RAISE
THE PRICING A LITTLE BIT?

31:37.864 --> 31:41.267
- RAISE THE PRICE
ON THE BUILDING?

31:41.301 --> 31:42.502
[stammers]

31:42.535 --> 31:44.771
THIS IS THE MOST ANNOYING THING
ABOUT REAL ESTATE.

31:44.804 --> 31:45.905
I WORK TIRELESSLY,

31:45.939 --> 31:47.807
CREATE THIS AMAZING
INTEREST LIST,

31:47.841 --> 31:49.776
AND OF COURSE,
THEN A DEVELOPER SAYS,

31:49.809 --> 31:52.112
FREDRIK, WE GOTTA RAISE
THE PRICES.

31:52.145 --> 31:54.114
- CURRENT PRICING THAT WE HAVE,
DO YOU THINK THAT'S

31:54.114 --> 31:55.115
A PREMIUM
FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

31:55.148 --> 31:56.116
- WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,

31:56.149 --> 31:57.684
AT THE PRICING
THAT WE HAVE--

31:57.717 --> 32:00.053
THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING,
THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING,

32:00.053 --> 32:02.088
YOU KNOW, WE'RE LOOKING
AT A RANGE

32:02.122 --> 32:04.824
OF ONE-BEDROOMS STARTING
AROUND 700,000,

32:04.858 --> 32:07.694
THE PENTHOUSE STARTING
AROUND 3 MILLION.

32:07.727 --> 32:10.597
BLENDED AVERAGE OF $1,431
A FOOT.

32:10.630 --> 32:12.332
- ALL RIGHT, FREDRIK.

32:12.365 --> 32:13.633
- YEAH?
- THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

32:13.667 --> 32:16.870
I WANT TO HIT $2,000
A SQUARE FOOT ON THIS BUILDING.

32:16.903 --> 32:19.072
- OOH.
[inhales sharply]

32:19.072 --> 32:21.107
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO RAISE THE PRICES

32:21.141 --> 32:23.443
BY A THIRD,
33%, BASICALLY.

32:23.476 --> 32:24.544
- I THINK YOU CAN DO IT.

32:24.577 --> 32:25.612
- YOU KNOW THAT'S NEVER,
EVER BEEN DONE.

32:25.645 --> 32:28.181
LIKE, NO ONE'S EVER
EVEN GOTTEN

32:28.214 --> 32:29.182
CLOSE TO THAT.

32:29.215 --> 32:31.351
- RECORDS ARE BROKEN
EVERY DAY.

32:31.384 --> 32:34.320
- THIS IS VERY,
VERY STRESSFUL.

32:34.354 --> 32:36.656
- MAKE IT HAPPEN.
- RIGHT, MAKE IT HAPPEN.

32:36.690 --> 32:39.959
UM, GOD, I SHOULD'VE BECOME
A DEVELOPER INSTEAD.

32:51.171 --> 32:53.106
- SINCE THE OPEN HOUSE
AND RECEIVING THE INITIAL OFFER,

32:53.139 --> 32:56.276
I HAD NO CALLS,
NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER.

32:56.309 --> 32:58.378
BUT THEN, THIS MORNING...
HELLO, THIS IS LUIS.

32:58.411 --> 33:01.047
I RECEIVE ANOTHER OFFER,
MUCH LOWER THAN OUR FIRST OFFER,

33:01.081 --> 33:02.515
6.5 MILLION.

33:02.549 --> 33:04.250
THE ASKING PRICE
IS 9.25 MILLION.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.788
- HELLO.
-<i>HOLA, HOLA, HOLA.</i>

33:08.822 --> 33:09.956
HOW ARE YOU?

33:10.056 --> 33:12.892
SO MY PLAN
IS TO MEET JEWEL

33:12.926 --> 33:14.094
AND BRING HER
DOWN TO PLANET EARTH.

33:14.127 --> 33:16.363
OKAY, SO WE--
WE CAME HERE TO TALK TO YOU

33:16.396 --> 33:19.666
BECAUSE WE--WE JUST RECENTLY HAD
ANOTHER OFFER.

33:19.699 --> 33:20.667
- GREAT.

33:20.700 --> 33:23.536
- IT'S AT 6.5 MILLION.

33:23.570 --> 33:26.873
AT $7 MILLION,
WE'RE AT $2,460 A FOOT.

33:26.906 --> 33:28.208
- EVEN FOR--IN THE HEIGHT
OF THE MARKET,

33:28.241 --> 33:32.612
EXACTLY THE SAME PENTHOUSE
WAS SOLD AT 2,500 A FOOT.

33:32.645 --> 33:34.314
- I MEAN, THIS IS
A PHENOMENAL APARTMENT.

33:34.347 --> 33:35.582
BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE MARKET
IS NOT SPEAKING

33:35.615 --> 33:40.186
FOR MORE THAN THOSE NUMBERS.

33:40.220 --> 33:43.990
- I HAVE BROUGHT THE PRICE
DOWN A LOT, YOU KNOW.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.459
- IT WAS ALREADY TOO HIGH
TO BEGIN WITH.

33:46.493 --> 33:49.462
- MM, THAT'S DEBATABLE.

33:49.496 --> 33:51.965
- $7 MILLION
IS A PHENOMENAL OFFER.

33:51.998 --> 33:53.900
APPARENTLY, WE'RE SO HIGH UP
IN THIS APARTMENT,

33:53.933 --> 33:55.902
AND THE AIR IS SO THIN,

33:55.935 --> 33:57.604
JEWEL CANNOT THINK STRAIGHT.

33:57.637 --> 33:59.272
- I'VE LIVED IN NEW YORK,
AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS

33:59.305 --> 34:00.940
TO LIVE OVER HERE,
AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS

34:01.041 --> 34:02.108
TO LIVE IN THIS SPACE.

34:02.142 --> 34:04.344
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THINK
THEY WANT TO BE CLOSE

34:04.377 --> 34:05.512
TO CENTRAL PARK,

34:05.545 --> 34:07.881
WHICH IS MOBBED WITH PEOPLE
AND TRAFFIC

34:07.914 --> 34:11.418
AND SMELLS LIKE...
DOG STUFF.

34:11.451 --> 34:12.652
- AND--
- AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE--

34:12.686 --> 34:14.654
MAYBE IT'S NOT
THE RIGHT TIME, YOU KNOW.

34:14.688 --> 34:16.756
MAYBE IT'S--I HAVE TO LIVE HERE
FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS.

34:16.790 --> 34:19.926
- IS GETTING YOUR PRICE WORTH
FOR YOU TO STAY

34:19.959 --> 34:21.127
FIVE MORE YEARS HERE?

34:21.161 --> 34:22.328
I MEAN, LIKE, I JUST WANT
TO UNDERSTAND IF--

34:22.362 --> 34:23.563
- OR TEN?
- OR TEN?

34:23.596 --> 34:27.200
[tense music]

34:27.233 --> 34:30.470
- IT MIGHT BE WORTH
ME JUST, LIKE, WAITING.

34:30.503 --> 34:34.507
- SHE IS NOT READY TO SELL,
SO I'M ONLY WASTING MY TIME.

34:34.541 --> 34:37.177
AND, UM...

34:37.210 --> 34:38.578
WHAT THE [bleep]
AM I DOING HERE?

34:38.611 --> 34:40.947
UH, ALL RIGHT,
SO I GUESS WE'LL REVISIT

34:40.980 --> 34:43.350
TWO, THREE YEARS FROM NOW.

34:43.383 --> 34:45.518
- ALL RIGHT.

34:45.552 --> 34:47.454
- OKAY.

34:47.487 --> 34:48.688
THE CRAZIEST PART
ABOUT REAL ESTATE IS

34:48.722 --> 34:51.424
ONE DAY, YOU CAN MAKE
$100,000 IN COMMISSIONS

34:51.458 --> 34:52.726
AND THE OTHER DAY
LOSE AN APARTMENT...

34:52.759 --> 34:53.960
[snaps fingers]
JUST LIKE THAT.

34:53.993 --> 34:55.862
ALL RIGHT.
IT SUCKS.

34:55.895 --> 34:57.630
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:57.664 --> 35:00.600
I MOVE ON
AND CLOSE SOME MORE DEALS.

35:13.346 --> 35:15.548
- I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TONIGHT

35:15.582 --> 35:17.350
TO KEEP MY TEMPER IN CHECK.

35:17.384 --> 35:20.220
HI, WE HAVE A RESERVATION,
I THINK,

35:20.253 --> 35:21.821
WITH FREDRIK EKLUND--
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S HERE YET.

35:21.855 --> 35:23.089
- SURE, OF COURSE.
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.

35:23.123 --> 35:26.092
- BECAUSE I NEED UNITS
IN THIS BUILDING.

35:26.126 --> 35:27.093
- HI!

35:27.127 --> 35:28.695
- HELLO.

35:28.728 --> 35:30.563
FOCUS, RYAN.

35:30.597 --> 35:31.765
FOCUS.

35:31.798 --> 35:32.932
- HI, I'M KENDRA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

35:32.966 --> 35:34.334
- I'M FREDRIK.
NICE TO MEET YOU, HI.

35:34.367 --> 35:35.335
- RYAN, NICE TO FINALLY
MEET YOU.

35:35.368 --> 35:36.603
- DEREK, HEY,
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

35:36.636 --> 35:37.971
- THE OPENING PARTY
FOR 250 BOWERY

35:38.071 --> 35:39.105
IS COMING UP NEXT WEEK,

35:39.139 --> 35:42.142
AND I'VE INVITED
HUNDREDS OF BROKERS.

35:42.175 --> 35:44.144
I'M THINKING
OF INVITING RYAN,

35:44.177 --> 35:46.246
BUT HE ALWAYS RUINS
MY PARTIES.

35:46.279 --> 35:48.114
SO I NEED TO PUSH HIS BUTTONS
A LITTLE BIT

35:48.148 --> 35:50.283
TO SEE IF HE
CAN BEHAVE HIMSELF.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.551
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
EACH OTHER?

35:51.584 --> 35:53.353
- SINCE LAST NIGHT.
- LAST NIGHT?

35:53.386 --> 35:55.088
- YEAH, WE MET LAST NIGHT.
- YEAH.

35:55.088 --> 35:56.523
- YOU'RE NOT BOYFRIEND
AND GIRLFRIENDS?

35:56.556 --> 35:57.824
- BOYFRIEND, GIRLFRIEND?
DO YOU--

35:57.857 --> 35:59.092
DO YOU WANNA BE MY GIRLFRIEND?
- YEAH.

35:59.092 --> 36:00.260
- YEAH.

36:00.293 --> 36:01.795
- KENDRA, IF YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE ONLY KNOWN HIM

36:01.828 --> 36:03.630
FOR 24 HOURS,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO, LIKE,

36:03.663 --> 36:06.866
GET TO KNOW HIM
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.301
- CAN YOU GIVE US, LIKE,
TWO MORE MINUTES?

36:08.335 --> 36:09.436
I HAVEN'T EVEN LOOKED
AT THIS.

36:09.469 --> 36:11.171
THANK YOU.
- I-I'M READY TO ORDER.

36:11.204 --> 36:13.473
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.

36:13.506 --> 36:16.376
- FREDRIK GETS ENJOYMENT
OUT OF JUST [bleep] WITH PEOPLE.

36:16.409 --> 36:19.546
- SO, KENDRA,
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

36:19.579 --> 36:21.348
- FROM BOSTON, ORIGINALLY.
- AH, BOSTON.

36:21.381 --> 36:23.550
- YEAH, AND I'LL PROBABLY
GO BACK DURING BREAK

36:23.583 --> 36:24.551
AND EVERYTHING AND--

36:24.584 --> 36:27.053
- SHE'S GONNA GO WHAT?
- WHAT?

36:27.087 --> 36:28.254
- YEAH, SHE'S IN COLLEGE.

36:28.288 --> 36:30.590
[humorous music]

36:30.623 --> 36:32.759
SHE'S STUDYING FASH...ION.
FASHION?

36:32.792 --> 36:34.394
- YEAH.
- FASHION.

36:34.427 --> 36:35.762
- YOU'RE IN COLLEGE?
- YEAH.

36:35.795 --> 36:38.264
- OH.
- SHE'S 19.

36:38.298 --> 36:40.166
AND HOW OLD IS FREDRIK?
50?

36:40.200 --> 36:41.668
HE'S PROBABLY, LIKE,
15 YEARS OLDER THAN DEREK

36:41.701 --> 36:44.704
AND MET HIM
ON THE INTERNET.

36:50.744 --> 36:52.545
GOOD WINE.

36:52.579 --> 36:53.880
- [groans]
MORE, ONE MORE.

36:53.913 --> 36:55.382
- UH--

36:55.415 --> 36:58.818
- THANK YOU.

36:58.852 --> 37:02.155
- I'M REALLY GLAD
WE'RE DOING THIS.

37:02.188 --> 37:04.491
I HONESTLY
HAVE LOOKED UP TO YOU

37:04.524 --> 37:06.259
FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.460
- YOU CAN'T SAY THAT
WITHOUT SMILING.

37:07.494 --> 37:08.661
- I'M NOT SMILING.
- YOU'RE NOT--

37:08.695 --> 37:09.662
- AM I SMILING RIGHT NOW?

37:09.696 --> 37:10.663
I'M TRYING TO BE

37:10.697 --> 37:11.898
AS AUTHENTIC AS POSSIBLE.

37:11.931 --> 37:13.733
BUT I--YOU KNOW, THE--

37:13.767 --> 37:14.901
HOW YOU'VE MARKETED
CERTAIN LISTING,

37:14.934 --> 37:16.403
HOW YOU'VE MARKETED
CERTAIN BUILDINGS,

37:16.436 --> 37:17.537
I'VE FOLLOWED
YOUR WHOLE CAREER,

37:17.570 --> 37:21.775
FROM THE DAY THAT I GOT
INTO REAL ESTATE.

37:21.808 --> 37:23.343
- I HAVE THIS BUILDING.
- YEAH.

37:23.376 --> 37:24.911
- IT'S A HOT PROPERTY.

37:24.944 --> 37:27.047
IT'S GONNA SELL QUICKLY,
BUT RYAN HERE,

37:27.047 --> 37:29.249
HE'S REALLY MAKING AN EFFORT,
AS YOU CAN SEE--

37:29.282 --> 37:30.850
AS YOU BOTH CAN SEE--

37:30.884 --> 37:33.586
- ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT I HAVE
A FAIR CONSIDERATION.

37:33.620 --> 37:34.587
- DO I TRUST HIM?

37:34.621 --> 37:36.256
- I THINK SO.

37:36.289 --> 37:37.357
HE LOOKS PRETTY TRUSTWORTHY.

37:37.390 --> 37:38.858
- HE'S BEEN VERY MEAN
TO ME, AND--

37:38.892 --> 37:40.627
- MEAN TO YOU?

37:40.660 --> 37:43.229
- WHY DID YOU JUMP
IN THE POOL?

37:43.263 --> 37:44.531
- I--

37:44.564 --> 37:45.699
I'M IMMATURE.

37:45.732 --> 37:48.268
AND I'VE BEEN A TOTAL ASS
TO FREDRIK,

37:48.301 --> 37:51.071
AND I APOLOGIZE,
IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU.

37:58.945 --> 38:00.246
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL
ANYTHING TO ME

38:00.280 --> 38:02.115
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

38:02.148 --> 38:05.051
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

38:05.085 --> 38:06.252
- I GOTTA ADMIT,

38:06.286 --> 38:09.456
IT'S A LOT OF FUN
TO SEE RYAN TRY SO HARD.

38:09.489 --> 38:10.557
- THANK YOU.

38:10.590 --> 38:11.758
- OH, THAT'S VERY GOOD
OF YOU.

38:11.791 --> 38:13.093
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT,
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

38:13.126 --> 38:15.161
- NO.

38:15.195 --> 38:17.030
- I GOT IT.
I CAN PAY.

38:17.030 --> 38:19.399
- BETTER MAKE SURE
IT WORKS.

38:19.432 --> 38:21.034
- IT WORKS.
- YEAH.

38:21.067 --> 38:22.702
- DEREK--HE'S FUNNY.
I LIKE HIM.

38:22.736 --> 38:24.037
HE'S NOT FUNNY.

38:24.037 --> 38:25.071
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

38:25.105 --> 38:26.406
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

38:26.439 --> 38:28.675
- I'M NOT HAPPY FOR THEM.

38:28.708 --> 38:30.710
- THANK YOU FOR DINNER, RYAN.
IT WAS REALLY GREAT.

38:30.744 --> 38:32.145
I HAVE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT
FOR SHOWING UP

38:32.178 --> 38:33.680
AND SHOWING THIS NIGHT
WITH RESPECT.

38:33.713 --> 38:35.482
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU,
'CAUSE I WANTED TO SEE

38:35.515 --> 38:37.050
WHERE THE DINNER'S GOING,
BUT I CAN TELL YOU NOW.

38:37.083 --> 38:39.853
I WILL INVITE YOU
TO A PARTY I'M DOING

38:39.886 --> 38:41.054
FOR 250 BOWERY.

38:41.087 --> 38:42.288
- YOU'RE DOING
AN OPENING PARTY?

38:42.322 --> 38:43.490
- I'M DOING A PARTY.

38:43.523 --> 38:44.958
- WHAT KIND OF PRICES
ARE YOU GONNA HAVE?

38:45.058 --> 38:46.726
- WE'RE STILL DISCUSSING IT.

38:46.760 --> 38:50.163
WELL, WE'RE NOT REALLY
DISCUSSING IT.

38:50.196 --> 38:52.766
BUT RYAN DOESN'T GET
TO KNOW THAT...YET.

38:52.799 --> 38:54.334
IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD DEAL
FOR YOUR BUYERS.

38:54.367 --> 38:56.169
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

38:56.202 --> 38:57.971
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

38:58.071 --> 38:59.706
- THAT DATE WAS RIDICULOUS.

38:59.739 --> 39:02.075
BUT AT LEAST I GOT
INTO THE 250 BOWERY PARTY,

39:02.108 --> 39:03.743
WHICH IS ALL
I REALLY CARED ABOUT.

39:03.777 --> 39:05.178
SO NOW LET'S JUST DO
SOME DEALS

39:05.211 --> 39:07.213
AND GET THIS OVER WITH.

39:07.247 --> 39:08.348
I HATE THAT GUY.

39:08.381 --> 39:10.350
- [laughs]
HE'S KIND OF A DICK.

39:10.383 --> 39:11.618
- HE IS A DICK, RIGHT?

39:11.651 --> 39:13.920
- I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.
- I HATE THAT GUY.

39:14.020 --> 39:15.722
- COMING UP...

39:15.755 --> 39:17.557
- WE RAISED IT JUST A TAD.
- NO WAY.

39:17.590 --> 39:19.559
- WHAT CAN I DO?
900 PEOPLE ON A WAITING LIST.

39:19.592 --> 39:21.661
- THAT MOTHER-[bleep].

39:31.037 --> 39:32.038
- WHERE DO YOU WANT THESE?

39:32.072 --> 39:33.873
- YEAH, LIKE THAT.
MORE, MORE, MORE.

39:33.907 --> 39:35.942
THE DAY HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.311
THE OFFERING PLAN OF BOWERY
HAS BEEN APPROVED,

39:38.345 --> 39:40.447
SO NOW I'M GOING
TO RELEASE PRICES

39:40.480 --> 39:42.048
AND START SHOWING
THE BUILDING.

39:42.048 --> 39:44.050
SO MAYBE YOU WANT TO START,
LIKE, PRE-MIXING DRINKS,

39:44.050 --> 39:45.418
'CAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST GONNA
START COMING IN.

39:45.452 --> 39:47.854
THE TURNOUT TONIGHT
IS GONNA BE HUGE.

39:47.887 --> 39:49.055
FOUR MORE MINUTES.

39:49.089 --> 39:50.924
I HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE
ON THE WAITING LIST.

39:50.957 --> 39:54.361
* *

39:54.394 --> 39:56.262
OKAY, I NEED A DRINK.

39:56.296 --> 39:58.198
THERE ARE TWO DRINKS
ON THE MENU TONIGHT.

39:58.231 --> 39:59.332
CHEERS.<i>SKAL.</i>

39:59.366 --> 40:00.367
<i>- SKAL.</i>

40:00.400 --> 40:01.735
- THEY SYMBOLIZE
THE TWO BEST THINGS

40:01.768 --> 40:02.969
ABOUT NEW YORK REAL ESTATE--

40:03.003 --> 40:05.638
250 BOWERY
AND FREDRIK, NO?

40:05.672 --> 40:07.340
I THINK WE'RE READY.

40:07.374 --> 40:08.608
HI. OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE MY FIR--

40:08.641 --> 40:10.610
- MARTY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

40:10.643 --> 40:12.512
- HI, GUYS, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HOW YOU DOING?

40:12.545 --> 40:14.180
- I'M FREDRIK.
NICE TO MEET YOU. WELCOME.

40:14.214 --> 40:15.615
SO COME ON.
FOLLOW ME.

40:15.648 --> 40:16.950
SO I'M RUNNING AROUND,
TRYING TO MEET AS MANY PEOPLE

40:16.983 --> 40:18.151
AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

40:18.184 --> 40:20.253
OKAY, HAVE A DRINK.
HAVE A FREDRIK.

40:20.286 --> 40:22.522
SO 24 UNITS, ALL GLASS.

40:22.555 --> 40:24.858
THE ONE-BEDROOMS ARE AMAZING,
VERY EFFICIENT.

40:24.891 --> 40:26.092
CASEMENT WINDOWS.

40:26.126 --> 40:27.227
- THIS ONE WOULD BE FINE
FOR THEM.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.229
- OKAY, WELL, LET'S GO
TO THE BUILDING.

40:29.262 --> 40:30.397
- YEAH?
- I'M LEAVING IN A FEW MINUTES.

40:30.430 --> 40:32.665
YEAH.
OKAY, I'M READY.

40:32.699 --> 40:34.034
COME WITH ME
TO THE BUILDING.

40:34.067 --> 40:35.268
YOU WANT TO COME TOO?

40:35.301 --> 40:37.070
TO THE BUILDING.
COME ON, GUYS.

40:37.103 --> 40:38.171
I'M REALLY EXCITED.

40:38.204 --> 40:39.339
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
PEOPLE ARE GOING

40:39.372 --> 40:40.507
TO SEE THIS BUILDING.

40:40.540 --> 40:42.409
SO YOU'RE IN ONE
OF THE PENTHOUSES NOW,

40:42.442 --> 40:45.745
AND LOOK AT THIS
MASSIVE LIVING ROOM.

40:45.779 --> 40:47.414
THIS IS ONE
OF THE ABSOLUTELY LARGEST,

40:47.447 --> 40:50.450
SO IT'S AROUND 6 MILLION.

40:50.483 --> 40:53.219
AM I NERVOUS
ABOUT THE PRICING?

40:53.253 --> 40:54.220
YEAH.

40:54.254 --> 40:56.289
ZACH RAISED THEM A LOT.

40:56.322 --> 40:58.892
SO WE RAISED IT JUST SLIGHTLY,
LIKE 35%.

41:00.927 --> 41:02.062
- 6 MILLION IS NOTHING
IN NEW YORK.

41:02.062 --> 41:03.129
LOOK AT THIS, THIS VIEW.

41:03.163 --> 41:04.864
IT'S ACTUALLY
A $60 MILLION VIEW.

41:04.898 --> 41:07.400
I SHOULD RAISE THE PRICE.
[laughter]

41:07.434 --> 41:10.270
BUT I HAVE TO BELIEVE
IN THE BUILDING AND MYSELF

41:10.303 --> 41:12.839
AND SELL THE UNITS LIKE THOSE
WERE ALWAYS THE PRICES.

41:12.872 --> 41:13.940
BE QUICK,
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW

41:13.973 --> 41:15.241
HOW LONG
THIS IS GONNA LAST.

41:15.275 --> 41:16.710
- OKAY--
- AAH! I'M BURNING!

41:16.743 --> 41:17.777
THE PAPER IS HOT.

41:17.811 --> 41:19.145
[indistinct chatter]

41:19.179 --> 41:20.413
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

41:20.447 --> 41:21.848
I NEED TO GET
THIS DEAL DONE.

41:21.881 --> 41:23.083
I JUST WANT TO GET THIS
OVER WITH.

41:23.083 --> 41:25.118
LET'S BE HAPPY.
LET'S MOVE ON WITH LIFE.

41:25.151 --> 41:27.454
- DO YOU LIKE RUM?
THIS IS A GREAT DRINK.

41:27.487 --> 41:28.655
- I DO.

41:28.688 --> 41:31.091
I NEVER HAVE TO SEE FREDRIK
EVER AGAIN,

41:31.091 --> 41:33.193
AND I WILL BE OKAY.

41:33.226 --> 41:35.428
- HI, CAN I HAVE A FREDRIK?
- SURE.

41:35.462 --> 41:37.263
- A FREDRIK.

41:37.297 --> 41:39.366
- YES, YOU CAN.

41:39.399 --> 41:41.134
- DID HE HAVE
A FREDRIK TOO?

41:41.167 --> 41:42.836
- NO, THEY'RE MAKING ME
A 250 BOWERY.

41:42.869 --> 41:43.837
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
