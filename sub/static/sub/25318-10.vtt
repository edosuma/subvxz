00:22.489 --> 00:25.524
Sing unto me the rapturous love song.

00:25.769 --> 00:27.835
Burn to me perfume.

00:27.933 --> 00:30.519
Don't touch me. Don't... let go.

00:34.153 --> 00:36.420
<i> I'm not here to spill secrets.</i>

00:36.496 --> 00:38.464
I'm here to restore your friends faith.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.878
I love you. I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

00:46.518 --> 00:48.586
There is something I have to tell you.

00:50.691 --> 00:52.117
Am I a part of your workings?

00:52.170 --> 00:54.064
A man of will knows no boundaries.

00:54.150 --> 00:55.885
Stay the fuck away from me.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.407
- Don't...
- I want my wife back.

02:08.937 --> 02:10.839
I quit.

03:27.343 --> 03:29.344
About time you guys showed up.

03:31.163 --> 03:33.280
Before you get your
drawers in a twist...

03:35.036 --> 03:36.530
You knew.

03:36.589 --> 03:38.190
And you never said a word.

03:39.062 --> 03:40.156
What are you talking about?

03:40.181 --> 03:42.752
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

03:43.565 --> 03:45.066
Marisol.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.412
I tried to warn you.

03:48.872 --> 03:50.620
I told you she was shining you on.

03:50.645 --> 03:52.479
From that, I'm supposed to
deduce that she was put up

03:52.504 --> 03:54.981
to the whole thing by
that-that deranged group?

03:55.006 --> 03:57.028
They're not deranged.
They're the only reason

03:57.053 --> 03:58.776
any of this happened. It worked.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.737
- Now you really have lost it.
- Guys?

04:00.762 --> 04:02.273
You really think you
could've sold the project

04:02.311 --> 04:04.548
if she hadn't been boosting your ego?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.487
Guys?

04:06.512 --> 04:08.054
Can you see were in the
middle of something?

04:08.079 --> 04:10.108
- How'd you come up with it?
- Come up with what?

04:10.186 --> 04:11.755
Using asphalt as a fuel.

04:11.941 --> 04:14.132
That's what I was trying
to tell you guys.

04:14.432 --> 04:16.160
There was a fire on the
roof of my garage.

04:16.185 --> 04:18.130
When I went up there to
put it out, I saw...

04:20.596 --> 04:21.738
I saw...

04:24.174 --> 04:25.259
What?

04:25.284 --> 04:27.419
The tar had melted in the heat.

04:27.444 --> 04:30.022
And the answer just hit me,
kind of like Richard here.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.619
Asphalt could be
the answer to the paradox.

04:32.809 --> 04:36.112
It pours as a liquid but hardens
into a solid once it cools.

04:36.855 --> 04:39.323
The rocket I just tested
produced a constant thrust

04:39.348 --> 04:41.423
for an entire minute.

04:42.494 --> 04:44.367
If you don't believe me, just
run a test for yourself.

04:44.392 --> 04:46.717
- Why are you doing this?
- What? Saving the day?

04:46.742 --> 04:49.065
No. Trying to worm your
way back onto the team.

04:49.090 --> 04:50.285
You're the one who quit.

04:50.310 --> 04:52.244
Who says I want to come
back onto the team?

04:52.847 --> 04:55.170
If my solution works, use it.

05:01.003 --> 05:02.066
Now what?

05:02.091 --> 05:04.159
Guys, this could actually work.

05:05.182 --> 05:08.351
I just felt like a goddamn
jackass, giving it away.

05:08.503 --> 05:11.532
Your colleague needs to be
convinced he needs you,

05:11.557 --> 05:14.967
and the only person hell be
convinced by is himself.

05:15.157 --> 05:16.257
He better.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.383
This demonstration for the
military needs to work,

05:18.408 --> 05:20.452
and I need to be there when it happens.

05:20.543 --> 05:23.846
Just keep focused on your intention.

05:23.871 --> 05:25.404
Believe me, I am focused.

05:25.429 --> 05:27.797
I am like a goddamn razor blade.

05:27.924 --> 05:30.359
And still, you doubt?

05:30.599 --> 05:33.144
I don't doubt this. I doubt Richard.

05:33.503 --> 05:35.471
I doubt Caltech, I doubt the military.

05:35.496 --> 05:37.120
I doubt anyone who isn't one of us.

05:37.145 --> 05:38.946
At least you no longer have to include

05:38.971 --> 05:41.872
Mrs. Parsons on that list.

05:43.359 --> 05:45.595
I'd love to know what you did
to make her come around.

05:45.633 --> 05:48.174
- Ask her.
- You don't think I've tried?

05:48.297 --> 05:49.667
You know I can't divulge

05:49.692 --> 05:51.528
what transpires in these sessions.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.553
Even if she's my wife?

05:53.755 --> 05:58.527
Especially if she's your wife.

05:59.842 --> 06:01.702
It's quite a thing,

06:02.325 --> 06:05.027
to be the keeper of everyone's secrets.

06:08.342 --> 06:09.510
Yes?

06:09.818 --> 06:11.587
A letter came.

06:12.695 --> 06:14.565
It's not addressed to you.

06:15.524 --> 06:17.240
It's for him.

06:31.687 --> 06:35.146
For as it says in Romans 13,

06:35.384 --> 06:36.684
verse eight...

06:37.126 --> 06:40.399
"Owe..." oh, no, I said Romans 13.

06:41.244 --> 06:43.865
Y-You typed "12."

06:52.028 --> 06:53.537
For as it says

06:53.610 --> 06:56.012
in Romans 13, verse eight,

06:56.372 --> 07:00.271
"Owe no man any thing,
but to love one another: "

07:00.356 --> 07:03.493
"for he that loves another
hath fulfilled the law..."

07:08.136 --> 07:10.640
You getting all this, Susan?

07:13.042 --> 07:17.173
Uh... Could you repeat that last part?

07:19.433 --> 07:22.597
What is going on with you?

07:24.067 --> 07:25.714
Excuse me.

07:48.117 --> 07:49.754
Susan.

07:50.681 --> 07:52.194
Susan.

08:01.124 --> 08:02.650
Tell me what's wrong.

08:02.744 --> 08:03.804
Nothing.

08:03.848 --> 08:06.717
Well, I... I can see for
myself it's not nothing.

08:07.257 --> 08:09.692
You haven't been yourself for weeks.

08:10.839 --> 08:13.842
I feel much better. We
can get back to work.

09:27.722 --> 09:29.349
"Based on your dedication
to the workings"

09:29.412 --> 09:31.737
"and the illuminations contained
therein, I am writing"

09:31.762 --> 09:34.117
"to invite you to become Man
and Brother of the faith."

09:34.759 --> 09:36.807
He's inviting me to ascend
to the next degree.

09:36.832 --> 09:38.719
Can you believe that? Crowley himself.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.154
Uh-huh.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.284
I wonder how he even knew about me.

09:43.307 --> 09:44.908
And get this: "It is an honor"

09:44.933 --> 09:47.035
"to have a true man of
science in our midst.

09:47.068 --> 09:49.266
"One who can help legitimize the work.

09:50.092 --> 09:52.690
- Jack...
- "In aiming for the stars,"

09:53.270 --> 09:55.905
"You are helping to further
our cause here on Earth."

09:58.313 --> 09:59.728
You seem flattered.

09:59.861 --> 10:01.750
Shouldn't I be?

10:02.590 --> 10:04.660
So you're going to accept?

10:10.606 --> 10:12.172
I don't want to go any
deeper into this thing

10:12.197 --> 10:14.131
unless it's gonna be
something we do together.

10:15.659 --> 10:16.752
I've been going.

10:16.799 --> 10:19.334
Yeah, to the private purging sessions.

10:20.948 --> 10:23.268
But you haven't been participating
in the rest of it.

10:25.076 --> 10:26.942
Why is that important to you?

10:27.113 --> 10:30.212
I want this to be something
we share together,

10:30.379 --> 10:33.956
with no more misunderstandings,
or secrets between us.

10:42.499 --> 10:43.747
For the official demonstration,

10:43.772 --> 10:45.574
we will actuate the
triggering mechanism

10:45.599 --> 10:46.532
inside the cockpit.

10:46.557 --> 10:48.192
Once you flip the switch,

10:48.421 --> 10:51.637
the rocket motors will combust,
increasing acceleration

10:51.731 --> 10:53.399
and decreasing the length of runway

10:53.439 --> 10:55.074
required to reach take-off speed.

10:55.381 --> 10:57.202
Hear the Japs are working
on planes that can take off

10:57.227 --> 10:59.215
from a submarine, using
a dang catapult.

10:59.265 --> 11:01.368
Of course they are. They
are a devious people.

11:01.393 --> 11:03.701
Our solution is far more sophisticated.

11:03.811 --> 11:06.054
It's our first time testing the
JATOs attached to a plane,

11:06.079 --> 11:08.057
but they seem to be operational.

11:08.113 --> 11:09.181
Seem to be?

11:09.206 --> 11:11.492
What he means is, our most recent test

11:11.517 --> 11:14.835
with just the rocket motors
went off without any problems.

11:15.034 --> 11:17.150
Well, what about the tests before that?

11:18.604 --> 11:21.540
Guys, it's gonna be me up
there on demonstration day.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.798
Something goes wrong, it'll be
me paying the ultimate price.

11:23.823 --> 11:26.201
The fact of the matter is,
once we made the switch

11:26.246 --> 11:28.202
to an asphalt-based fuel,

11:28.375 --> 11:30.842
the previous issues wed been
experiencing went away.

11:30.911 --> 11:32.446
Well, so long as they're safe.

11:32.612 --> 11:35.116
That's what were here to demonstrate.

11:35.529 --> 11:36.996
On my count.

11:37.177 --> 11:42.236
Five, four, three, two, one.

12:00.285 --> 12:01.386
Wait!

12:01.411 --> 12:03.380
No goddamn way I'm flying
with those things

12:03.405 --> 12:05.039
strapped to my wings.

12:10.918 --> 12:12.404
Fuck.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.067
Hi.

12:23.907 --> 12:26.632
So this is where you've been living?

12:27.700 --> 12:30.409
I'm looking for the Magus. Is he in?

12:45.998 --> 12:48.068
Care to join me for a tipple?

12:54.367 --> 12:56.109
Or perhaps

12:56.871 --> 12:59.439
we could have a short stroll.

12:59.965 --> 13:01.901
Take advantage of this weather.

13:04.977 --> 13:06.212
<i>I was surprised myself.</i>

13:06.844 --> 13:10.159
It's not often the Master takes
such an interest in a minerval.

13:10.464 --> 13:12.094
How did he even know about him?

13:12.182 --> 13:14.001
Crowley has his ways.

13:14.148 --> 13:16.444
Well, Jack isn't going to
accept the invitation.

13:16.723 --> 13:17.884
Not unless I...

13:17.909 --> 13:19.209
Not unless you what?

13:20.498 --> 13:21.925
He wants Thelema to be something

13:21.950 --> 13:23.565
we can share fully.

13:24.551 --> 13:26.353
And what do you want?

13:27.030 --> 13:28.898
Workings are not to
be undertaken lightly

13:28.923 --> 13:30.333
or against your will.

13:30.456 --> 13:32.862
Workings. Ascension.

13:33.132 --> 13:35.301
For people so devoted to
uncovering the truth,

13:35.468 --> 13:37.361
why not call it by its actual name?

13:37.446 --> 13:40.683
What words would you prefer I use?
Sodomy?

13:40.948 --> 13:43.072
Fornication? Sin?

13:43.309 --> 13:45.187
Because these words do
not describe what we do.

13:45.212 --> 13:48.591
They are words used by those
who seek to limit and control.

13:48.662 --> 13:52.765
Words you learned to speak
in the confessional.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.693
It's not the words, it's the behavior.

13:54.801 --> 13:58.586
You're right. It is the
act, not the label.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.382
It's a method to know oneself,

14:01.407 --> 14:05.031
and by so doing, to know God.

14:07.239 --> 14:08.872
You believe in God?

14:09.001 --> 14:11.646
Not just God, but the Goddess.

14:11.711 --> 14:14.447
Nuit, the great mother,
the source of all things.

14:14.472 --> 14:16.708
Her power is within you,
waiting to be unleashed.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.782
You are on the precipice,

14:20.857 --> 14:24.876
but until you confront the
source of your shame...

14:26.332 --> 14:29.374
...you will remain a prisoner of it.

14:46.392 --> 14:47.610
All out!

14:47.699 --> 14:48.779
Oh, hurry up.

14:48.804 --> 14:49.936
Welcome to the Moon!

14:49.984 --> 14:52.016
Oh, its lovely.

14:52.075 --> 14:54.107
- You're lovely.
- Ooh!

14:54.312 --> 14:56.736
Come over here, everybody!

15:15.863 --> 15:18.123
With swift
decision, the R.A.F. replied to

15:18.148 --> 15:19.575
the Nazi raid on the Orkneys

15:19.600 --> 15:22.271
when the first civilian was
killed on British soil.

15:23.931 --> 15:25.434
A large number of R.A.F. bombers

15:25.459 --> 15:27.820
set out for the fortified
German island of Sylt

15:27.902 --> 15:30.372
and bombarded seaplane
bases, ammunition dumps

15:30.397 --> 15:31.990
and harbors up and down the island

15:32.015 --> 15:34.018
continuously for six hours.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.347
List, of which this is an
aerial photo, had its share,

15:40.456 --> 15:42.423
as well as the Hindenburgdamm.

15:42.756 --> 15:44.479
Britain has shown her determination

15:44.558 --> 15:46.326
to answer Nazi raids in a language

15:46.351 --> 15:48.453
the Boche understand.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.629
I just don't understand
why you're going.

15:50.710 --> 15:51.845
It's Easter.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.766
You know what I mean.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.696
You've found a new religion,
one that actually works.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.255
Careful, that credenza
was a wedding gift from my aunt.

15:59.293 --> 16:00.650
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, good, we caught you.

16:00.683 --> 16:02.351
- Carl, go get that box.
- Yeah.

16:02.784 --> 16:04.653
How are you two settling in?

16:04.726 --> 16:07.141
So far, so good. Though,
whoever lived here before

16:07.166 --> 16:08.701
sure made a mess of the place.

16:08.808 --> 16:10.004
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:10.029 --> 16:12.152
Well, you can't pick your neighbors.

16:13.186 --> 16:14.750
This got left behind

16:14.775 --> 16:18.885
and, uh, we weren't really
sure what to do with it.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.080
Well get it back to him.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.295
So you're still acquainted?

16:23.443 --> 16:25.313
We know where to find him.

16:25.413 --> 16:29.250
I should be going. Don't
want to be late for mass.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.698
Parsons residence.

17:10.542 --> 17:13.830
Congratulations. You win.

17:14.410 --> 17:16.131
What are you talking about?

17:17.465 --> 17:19.434
I need your help.

17:22.097 --> 17:23.270
<i> Before I called,</i>

17:23.310 --> 17:25.948
I'd pretty much decided
that we needed to cancel.

17:26.515 --> 17:28.016
I didn't see another way.

17:28.096 --> 17:29.811
With the demonstration so close,

17:29.859 --> 17:32.160
a workable solution
seeming so illusory...

17:32.344 --> 17:34.546
So what changed your mind?

17:34.989 --> 17:36.365
I was sitting in a movie theater

17:36.418 --> 17:40.016
watching a newsreel about
Britain dropping bombs

17:40.041 --> 17:41.868
on a Nazi seaplane base.

17:43.151 --> 17:45.436
This war is getting worse by the day.

17:47.041 --> 17:49.876
And everything just feels
so huge and important.

17:49.905 --> 17:51.540
And I just kept thinking to myself,

17:52.353 --> 17:53.440
we are so close.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.791
And not just to getting
funding or even legitimacy.

17:56.845 --> 17:59.009
We are so close to being a part of it,

17:59.479 --> 18:00.564
to mattering.

18:00.589 --> 18:01.643
Mm-hmm.

18:01.668 --> 18:03.838
And in the face of something that big,

18:03.863 --> 18:08.235
this grudge between us, it feels
kind of small, doesn't it?

18:08.958 --> 18:12.108
I agree. The only thing that matters

18:12.133 --> 18:14.303
is that were part of what's to come.

18:15.768 --> 18:16.969
Right.

18:18.933 --> 18:20.436
I'm glad.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.125
As you can see,

18:23.437 --> 18:25.758
four of the JATOs fired perfectly.

18:25.926 --> 18:28.463
However, the other two
failed spectacularly.

18:28.710 --> 18:31.267
One would've taken the
head off of the pilot,

18:31.292 --> 18:33.128
had he been in the plane.

18:33.367 --> 18:34.568
You must've done something wrong.

18:34.593 --> 18:35.827
Well, I realize that.

18:35.852 --> 18:37.563
And if we had more time, I am confident

18:37.588 --> 18:39.690
that our team could
figure out what, but...

18:41.419 --> 18:43.556
but with the presentation upon us,

18:43.581 --> 18:46.717
I-I am asking you if
you have any ideas.

18:47.424 --> 18:50.105
If I had to guess, the two
rockets that misfired

18:50.130 --> 18:51.740
were packed the day before the test,

18:51.765 --> 18:54.135
but the others were packed the day of.

18:56.172 --> 18:59.265
I know I'm not an actual
scientist like the rest of you,

18:59.290 --> 19:02.493
but I'm smart enough to know
it gets cold at night,

19:02.603 --> 19:04.438
especially out here.

19:05.174 --> 19:08.075
Must've been a good 30 degrees
hotter when you ran the test.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.301
Yeah, so?

19:09.458 --> 19:10.658
Yeah, so,

19:10.683 --> 19:12.025
the fluctuation in temperature

19:12.050 --> 19:14.325
would cause cracks to
form in the asphalt,

19:14.350 --> 19:15.718
which leads to uneven combustion.

19:15.783 --> 19:17.471
You thought of that just now?

19:17.613 --> 19:19.170
Of course not.

19:19.486 --> 19:21.721
I had the same issue when I
did my preliminary tests.

19:21.746 --> 19:24.015
Which you conveniently
failed to mention.

19:24.198 --> 19:25.510
Must've slipped my mind somewhere

19:25.535 --> 19:28.623
between getting punched in the
face and being called a liar.

19:29.923 --> 19:31.759
The good news is, there's a fix.

19:33.412 --> 19:35.631
We have to pack the JATOs
as close as possible

19:35.656 --> 19:37.291
to the demonstration itself.

19:37.619 --> 19:40.121
Wait, we?

19:41.004 --> 19:42.678
Yes, Richard, we.

19:43.050 --> 19:44.456
I can see now that it was a mistake

19:44.481 --> 19:46.021
to trust you guys with my breakthrough.

19:46.046 --> 19:47.837
Well, thanks to you leaving out

19:47.862 --> 19:49.788
a key piece of information,

19:50.891 --> 19:52.665
we scared off the test pilot.

19:54.522 --> 19:56.664
Do you have a quick fix for that?

20:11.767 --> 20:13.582
Hey.

20:14.001 --> 20:15.918
Sorry, I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

20:18.126 --> 20:19.960
What are you doing here?

20:20.054 --> 20:22.471
I came to give you back this.

20:23.151 --> 20:24.957
I know why you left it behind.

20:30.931 --> 20:32.601
Look, your declaration,

20:32.692 --> 20:34.943
or whatever it was...

20:37.204 --> 20:39.172
caught me off guard.

20:40.288 --> 20:42.631
I was just trying to
get a rise out of you.

20:43.085 --> 20:44.191
You were right.

20:44.216 --> 20:47.044
You are the only one who's gotten
me closer to what I want.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.388
That all?

20:57.345 --> 20:58.789
It's a lot.

20:59.734 --> 21:02.604
No. Is that all you came here for?

21:05.026 --> 21:07.028
Your prophecy came true.

21:07.594 --> 21:10.623
I did see the Great Beast,
and exactly like you said,

21:10.960 --> 21:13.296
he showed me my true path.

21:14.181 --> 21:16.540
But I can't walk it alone.

21:19.607 --> 21:22.866
We have a demonstration
tomorrow for the military.

21:23.211 --> 21:25.255
Bully for you.

21:26.220 --> 21:28.409
The thing is, the team
can't do it without me,

21:28.434 --> 21:30.936
and I can't do it without you.

21:32.406 --> 21:34.877
I don't know what to label it.

21:35.062 --> 21:38.973
Elemental opposite. Friend. Compatriot.

21:39.361 --> 21:41.335
All I know is that love is the law,

21:41.360 --> 21:43.029
whatever form it takes.

21:43.114 --> 21:44.416
And you have to heed it.

21:44.532 --> 21:45.667
What do you want from me?

21:45.919 --> 21:48.450
If the test is successful,
the military is offering us

21:48.501 --> 21:51.816
over $100,000 in funding.

21:52.107 --> 21:54.141
What do you want?

21:54.214 --> 21:56.563
Imagine the possibilities.

21:57.498 --> 21:59.813
With that kind of money,
everything would change.

21:59.969 --> 22:03.204
For me, for you, for the Agape.

22:03.899 --> 22:06.233
Maybe I'm done helping you.

22:09.359 --> 22:11.068
That'd be a shame.

22:13.325 --> 22:15.367
"The true magic of Horus requires"

22:15.392 --> 22:18.080
"the passionate union of opposites."

22:26.027 --> 22:28.529
What do you need me to do?

23:25.474 --> 23:27.308
<i>You shall not eat of the fruit!</i>

23:27.413 --> 23:28.900
Daddy, I wasn't!

23:28.931 --> 23:30.680
I don't want to hear your excuses.

23:30.798 --> 23:32.032
<i>You wish to taste it,</i>

23:32.057 --> 23:34.308
<i>then fill your damn mouth with it.</i>

23:34.754 --> 23:36.485
<i>See what you've become?</i>

23:36.958 --> 23:40.084
<i>I'm going to teach you about shame.</i>

23:42.717 --> 23:44.325
Susan?

23:44.559 --> 23:45.852
Dinners almost ready.

23:45.877 --> 23:48.448
Daddy wants us to come set the table.

24:03.636 --> 24:05.109
Sorry for stopping by without phoning,

24:05.134 --> 24:06.369
but it's important.

24:06.427 --> 24:08.095
Oh, dear.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.779
I was worried this day would come.

24:11.152 --> 24:12.579
At least you don't have children.

24:12.604 --> 24:15.373
- That would make it far harder.
- What are you talking about?

24:15.556 --> 24:17.569
Well, after Susans last visit,

24:17.594 --> 24:19.363
it's obvious you're not happy.

24:19.433 --> 24:21.369
No, mother, that's not it at all.

24:21.535 --> 24:23.071
We've never been happier together.

24:23.203 --> 24:26.111
Oh, well, that's wonderful to hear.

24:26.136 --> 24:27.724
I came by to tell you that tomorrow's

24:27.749 --> 24:30.429
the demonstration for the military.

24:32.546 --> 24:34.071
Take a good, long look.

24:34.504 --> 24:36.101
If everything goes according to plan,

24:36.126 --> 24:37.341
you'll never have to look at that house

24:37.366 --> 24:39.414
from the outside again.

24:42.016 --> 24:43.463
Oh, Jack.

24:43.564 --> 24:45.300
That's a promise.

25:14.048 --> 25:16.951
The choir was magnificent.

25:26.862 --> 25:29.108
What? Yeah. It was beautiful.

25:29.197 --> 25:30.247
Thank you, ma'am.

25:31.185 --> 25:33.188
Now, before we begin,

25:33.400 --> 25:35.675
I would like to thank
Father Shelby for coming.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.734
We are blessed by his presence.

25:38.814 --> 25:41.315
Blessed in more ways than one, hmm?

25:43.631 --> 25:47.188
It is truly a day of
miracles and new beginnings.

25:47.248 --> 25:50.451
And with that in mind, would you
do us the honor of saying grace?

25:50.618 --> 25:53.169
It would be a pleasure.
It's the least I can do

25:53.194 --> 25:55.857
for our parish's most
generous advocate.

25:55.956 --> 25:57.043
Let us pray.

25:57.068 --> 25:59.922
O Lord, the resurrection of your Son

25:59.962 --> 26:01.496
has renewed our spirit.

26:01.930 --> 26:03.284
Grant us the wisdom

26:03.338 --> 26:04.805
to know what we must do,

26:05.433 --> 26:07.254
the courage to undertake it,

26:07.338 --> 26:08.855
and the will to complete it.

26:08.936 --> 26:10.577
Bless these, Thy gifts,

26:10.645 --> 26:12.627
which we are about to
receive from Thy bounty.

26:12.668 --> 26:15.161
- Through Christ our Lord.
- Amen.

26:21.709 --> 26:24.211
Well, perhaps now would be a good time.

26:24.319 --> 26:26.954
Go on, your little
secret should be shared

26:26.979 --> 26:28.541
with those you are closest to.

26:28.629 --> 26:29.997
What little secret?

26:30.284 --> 26:33.052
Well, she's been calling
in sick a lot lately.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.309
Hmm? Barely able to keep food down.

26:35.462 --> 26:36.857
Mm, your mother was

26:36.882 --> 26:38.700
the exact same way with your sister.

26:38.725 --> 26:40.450
Congratulations, Susan.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.009
This is wonderful news.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.845
Yes, dear. Perhaps it'll be a boy.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.393
Well, I'm just sorry

26:46.418 --> 26:48.682
that Jack isn't here, because...

26:48.923 --> 26:50.959
well, he's finally done
something worth celebrating.

26:52.967 --> 26:54.187
But I'm not...

26:54.515 --> 26:56.594
- You're not...?
- What you think I am.

26:56.719 --> 26:57.819
What do you mean?

26:58.331 --> 27:00.400
I mean, I'm not expecting.

27:01.782 --> 27:03.029
Uh, well...

27:03.576 --> 27:06.662
course you are.

27:07.402 --> 27:09.039
Stop it, Patty.

27:11.233 --> 27:13.127
Oh, the look on your faces.

27:14.548 --> 27:16.316
I said, stop it.

27:18.038 --> 27:19.839
All right, well, if you
can't behave yourself,

27:19.864 --> 27:21.781
then you will just have to
spend the rest of the evening

27:21.806 --> 27:23.115
up in your room.

27:23.463 --> 27:24.863
No, come on.

27:25.005 --> 27:26.172
Let her go.

27:26.387 --> 27:28.121
What... Excuse me?

27:28.471 --> 27:30.381
I can't... anymore.

27:30.424 --> 27:33.070
- What the devil are you talking about?
- You know.

27:33.173 --> 27:36.878
I... Have both of you conspired
to humiliate me today?

27:37.011 --> 27:38.413
I...

27:38.758 --> 27:40.141
Tell them.

27:40.274 --> 27:42.108
I don't know what she's talking about.

27:42.563 --> 27:44.341
I'm going to teach you about shame,

27:44.366 --> 27:45.923
I'm going to teach you about shame,

27:45.948 --> 27:48.396
- I'm going to teach you about shame.
- This is my house,

27:48.421 --> 27:51.042
- And I am not gonna stand here...
- Why didn't you ever say anything?

27:51.211 --> 27:53.279
And what about you, Father?

27:53.601 --> 27:55.213
Did he confess his sins?

27:55.295 --> 27:57.289
And did you give him
some prayers as penance,

27:57.314 --> 27:59.859
as if that could ever wash him clean?!

28:02.836 --> 28:05.463
Patty?

28:12.347 --> 28:13.820
How could you do that her?

28:13.887 --> 28:15.260
Your own flesh and blood?

28:16.817 --> 28:18.652
Shut your vile mouth!

28:19.391 --> 28:21.183
I will cut you off.

28:22.009 --> 28:23.271
Do you understand?

28:23.880 --> 28:25.033
If you don't apologize

28:25.059 --> 28:27.928
and take back what you
said this instant!

28:28.475 --> 28:30.309
You'll lose your house!

28:30.905 --> 28:33.139
You'll be put out on the street!

28:49.036 --> 28:50.903
Can I come in?

28:58.411 --> 29:00.714
Jesus, its freezing.

29:01.561 --> 29:04.132
How long have you been
sitting in there?

29:07.227 --> 29:09.062
Here, let me warm it up for you.

29:23.797 --> 29:25.404
I'm ready.

29:27.535 --> 29:29.381
Anywhere its taking us,

29:29.670 --> 29:32.005
it's better than where I've been.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.661
Okay.

30:44.547 --> 30:47.148
Tap the side gently, okay?

30:47.954 --> 30:51.424
We want to get rid of
all the air bubbles.

30:57.965 --> 30:59.259
You ready?

31:00.345 --> 31:03.363
Even the slightest gap
can mean a disaster.

31:11.492 --> 31:13.459
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

31:13.834 --> 31:15.087
Good, good, good.

33:14.041 --> 33:16.294
What are you doing?

33:17.181 --> 33:20.000
I'm waiting on the moon.

33:20.434 --> 33:22.373
That thing is never
gonna get you there.

33:22.523 --> 33:25.292
I don't care how many puny
rockets you strap to the wing.

33:26.152 --> 33:28.378
It's just a stepping stone.

33:29.129 --> 33:31.765
Don't let them do that to you, son.

33:32.045 --> 33:33.715
Do what?

33:34.143 --> 33:36.618
Make you think the same way they do.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.985
Rise and shine.

34:18.797 --> 34:20.000
You came.

34:20.293 --> 34:22.295
I said I would.

34:28.034 --> 34:29.927
What are you doing out here?

34:31.496 --> 34:33.907
I saw the Great Beast again last night.

34:35.864 --> 34:37.431
He's inside me.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.681
I don't doubt it.

34:44.414 --> 34:45.600
Up and at 'em, boys!

34:45.995 --> 34:47.955
Our destiny awaits!

34:48.547 --> 34:50.616
The military already
sent someone to film.

34:50.991 --> 34:53.400
He's not here to film; he's
here to fly the damn plane.

34:53.426 --> 34:55.556
You claimed to have found
a suitable replacement.

34:55.621 --> 34:58.291
Ernest can fly with the best of
them... I know from experience.

34:58.351 --> 34:59.944
That's an Ercoupe 415-Charlie...

35:00.007 --> 35:02.074
A trained orangutan
could fly that thing.

35:08.187 --> 35:09.689
Jack.

35:10.094 --> 35:11.445
I don't have time to argue, Richard.

35:11.479 --> 35:13.180
This stuff doesn't come off easy.

35:13.258 --> 35:16.028
This is taking it too far... we
can't let him fly that plane.

35:16.383 --> 35:18.028
Ernest is a grown man.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.415
Okay? He's doing this
of his own free will.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.373
If today is anything like last time,

35:22.406 --> 35:23.836
he could get seriously hurt.

35:23.861 --> 35:26.494
- It won't be. It won't be.
- How do you know?

35:26.526 --> 35:28.128
- I just know.
- No. You don't.

35:28.678 --> 35:30.030
How far are you willing to go?

35:30.355 --> 35:32.903
- Do you want to matter, or don't you?
- Yes. But...

35:32.993 --> 35:34.770
No fuckin' excuses.

35:36.178 --> 35:39.039
You want to know the real reason
Marisol would never go for you?

35:39.703 --> 35:41.813
It's because you don't have any faith.

35:43.482 --> 35:45.686
Not even in yourself.

37:20.012 --> 37:22.849
Do you do this of your own true will?

37:26.692 --> 37:28.326
I do.

37:33.479 --> 37:36.632
Then let the rituals be
performed with beauty...

37:38.024 --> 37:39.859
and grace.

38:23.308 --> 38:24.635
General Braxton.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.123
Professors, welcome.

38:26.148 --> 38:27.115
Welcome, sir.

38:27.140 --> 38:28.495
- How are you?
- Big day, Mr. Onsted.

38:28.528 --> 38:29.827
Thank you.

38:30.030 --> 38:32.099
- Mr. Parsons.
- How are you, General?

38:32.313 --> 38:34.048
Mr. Parsons.

38:34.081 --> 38:35.770
I thought your participation

38:35.796 --> 38:37.865
in rocketry team had come to an end.

38:38.131 --> 38:41.237
It had until I got a last-minute
call from Richard here.

38:41.521 --> 38:42.956
He was in need of a little assistance.

38:43.189 --> 38:44.430
As you said before,

38:44.550 --> 38:45.927
takes two to have an argument.

38:45.959 --> 38:47.061
Yes, my boys.

38:47.213 --> 38:48.493
Please, make yourself comfortable.

38:48.574 --> 38:50.463
Well get started very
shortly, gentlemen.

38:50.544 --> 38:52.237
All right.

39:04.244 --> 39:06.352
- I'll take care of this.
- No, I will.

39:07.947 --> 39:10.684
The chosen apostle of
infinite space is the Beast

39:10.709 --> 39:12.678
and in his woman called
the Scarlet Woman

39:12.703 --> 39:14.953
is all power given.

39:21.673 --> 39:23.607
They shall bring the
chosen into their fold.

39:23.632 --> 39:25.241
They shall bring the
glory of the heavens

39:25.265 --> 39:26.666
into the hearts of men.

39:29.857 --> 39:35.194
Look within... and open yourself.

39:48.981 --> 39:50.614
What are you doing here?

39:51.434 --> 39:54.362
It wasn't all a lie.

39:54.573 --> 39:57.097
- Marisol, this is not the time.
- Just listen.

39:58.515 --> 40:01.968
I know it started one way,
maybe not the best way,

40:02.178 --> 40:07.626
but... how I feel about you is real.

40:08.212 --> 40:10.978
I came all the way out
here just to prove it.

40:14.014 --> 40:16.017
Did Jack send you?

40:16.261 --> 40:18.284
- Or that-that group?
- No, Richie.

40:18.461 --> 40:22.789
I swear. I'm not even part
of the Agape anymore.

40:22.979 --> 40:26.238
I got exactly what I
was looking for and...

40:27.254 --> 40:29.339
he's standing right in front of me.

40:35.202 --> 40:37.041
You see the ignition switch?

40:39.055 --> 40:40.112
Right there.

40:40.206 --> 40:42.510
So on my signal, you flip that

40:42.993 --> 40:46.012
and the JATOs are gonna carry
you straight into the heavens.

40:46.142 --> 40:47.775
You taking it all in?

40:48.495 --> 40:50.383
You've spent your whole
life wanting this.

40:51.774 --> 40:54.454
The moment when your
dreams could come true.

40:55.590 --> 40:56.923
It's all thanks to you.

40:57.817 --> 41:00.160
I'm just a cog in the Great Work.

41:00.355 --> 41:01.655
Like the master says,

41:01.680 --> 41:05.350
"Worship me in blood and fire."

41:06.792 --> 41:08.535
Be sort of fitting, don't you think?

41:08.980 --> 41:12.939
Going down in flames for
the sake of my elemental?

41:13.139 --> 41:15.405
Are you just trying to get
a rise out of me again?

41:15.596 --> 41:18.870
Nope. Meant what I said, Jack.
I'd do anything for you.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.222
Well, I'm not asking you to do that.

41:22.258 --> 41:23.420
Sure, Jack.

41:25.160 --> 41:27.521
You know what drew me to the Agape?

41:27.623 --> 41:31.525
It was this magical place where
people let their guards down,

41:31.722 --> 41:33.394
trusted one another.

41:33.497 --> 41:37.097
God help us if anyone ever got
in, tried to take advantage.

41:37.316 --> 41:39.233
Be like a wolf in a hen house.

41:40.812 --> 41:42.038
I don't understand what you're saying.

41:42.063 --> 41:44.169
Are you... do you want to
fly this plane or not?

41:47.653 --> 41:49.464
Do or die time.

41:49.937 --> 41:51.965
Tell me you're not gonna
do something crazy.

41:52.062 --> 41:53.163
Ernest.

41:53.227 --> 41:54.326
I can't hear you!

41:54.476 --> 41:55.915
Shit.

42:25.619 --> 42:29.602
Do what thou wilt shall
be the whole of the law.

42:36.151 --> 42:38.220
There is no law beyond

42:38.299 --> 42:40.301
<i>do what thou wilt.</i>

43:38.794 --> 43:43.154
Count down from the number 93.

43:45.407 --> 43:49.157
The value ascribed to love and will,

43:49.273 --> 43:52.695
the cornerstones of our faith.

43:53.354 --> 43:54.977
93...

43:56.270 --> 43:57.910
92...

43:59.177 --> 44:00.807
91...

44:00.832 --> 44:03.416
<i>Maleficium haereticum in nobis...</i>

44:03.541 --> 44:04.986
<i> 90...</i>

44:05.064 --> 44:06.773
<i>...eradicandum.</i>

44:08.260 --> 44:09.525
<i> 89...</i>

44:09.598 --> 44:12.233
This group that has poisoned her mind

44:12.269 --> 44:14.650
will have its reckoning.

44:18.199 --> 44:21.259
- 68...
- Focus on your intention.

44:21.377 --> 44:23.223
67...

44:23.304 --> 44:25.721
Whatever it is you wish to manifest.

44:25.955 --> 44:28.086
- 66...
- Whatever it is

44:28.138 --> 44:30.140
You desire.

44:33.285 --> 44:37.235
65... 64...

44:38.244 --> 44:40.534
63...

44:42.483 --> 44:44.619
<i> 62...</i>

44:45.772 --> 44:47.420
<i>61...</i>

44:48.977 --> 44:52.346
Let's get this show on the road.

44:55.263 --> 45:00.120
24... 23...

45:00.727 --> 45:02.470
22...

45:02.629 --> 45:03.868
Roll camera.

45:03.921 --> 45:05.478
<i>21...</i>

45:06.422 --> 45:08.757

45:08.816 --> 45:10.350

45:11.485 --> 45:12.899

45:12.946 --> 45:16.043

45:16.068 --> 45:18.536
16...

45:18.893 --> 45:22.507
<i>...15... 14...</i>

45:23.043 --> 45:26.076
<i>13... 12...</i>

45:26.734 --> 45:28.636
<i>11...</i>

45:28.717 --> 45:30.217
Ten...

45:51.747 --> 45:52.914
...one!

46:03.851 --> 46:05.019
Bravo!

46:07.941 --> 46:09.270
Yes!

46:25.865 --> 46:29.169
Wow. Oh, my God.
