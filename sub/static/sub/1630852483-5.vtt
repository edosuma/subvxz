too far when we were joking around.

belong to the government.

17:25.910 --> 17:28.240
If we did not suffer, then who did?

17:43.060 --> 17:44.630
One, two, three, four...

17:47.660 --> 17:48.930
Here, lie down.

17:51.430 --> 17:52.670
What is wrong?

17:52.730 --> 17:56.340
My dirty feet will soil the silk bedding.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.940
I am grateful,
but how could I sleep on that?

17:59.010 --> 18:01.380
I will just sleep on the floor.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.780
We will get spanked
if we step on the bedding.

18:09.350 --> 18:12.090
Gosh, this is nice.

18:13.750 --> 18:14.690
Hold on.

18:17.290 --> 18:18.890
Why is this so fluffy?

18:18.960 --> 18:20.630
Lord Cha Mal-jong

18:20.690 --> 18:22.530
hated hard pillows.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.830
So the pillows were made with cotton.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.430
I see.

18:26.630 --> 18:29.670
This is made
of that priceless cotton, is it?

18:29.740 --> 18:32.110
We changed the cotton every month.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.180
Just how valuable is this pillow?

18:38.910 --> 18:40.050
Here, take it.

18:40.850 --> 18:42.550
Here. You too.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.020
Let us have a pillow fight!

18:49.660 --> 18:53.530
-It is snowing!
-Snow!

19:04.370 --> 19:06.910
I am so happy!

19:06.970 --> 19:09.740
Can someone move?

19:10.310 --> 19:13.880
I have never felt something
so fluffy in my life.

19:14.010 --> 19:16.080
I feel like I am on the clouds.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.220
I will show you something fun.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.130
If I do this with my hands...

19:25.860 --> 19:28.460
Look. What does it look like?

19:29.330 --> 19:30.600
Flutter.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.000
It is pretty.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.400
Does it not look like a butterfly?
Can you all try it?

19:37.470 --> 19:39.010
-Yes.
-Yes.

19:39.070 --> 19:40.340
-I can make a bird.
-Me too!

19:40.440 --> 19:41.780
-I made a snail.
-A butterfly for me.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.710
-I am going to make a snail.
-I will make a deer.

19:43.780 --> 19:44.910
I made a toad.

19:46.180 --> 19:47.950
♫ Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad ♫

19:48.020 --> 19:51.920
♫ I will give you an old house,
so give me a new one ♫

19:51.990 --> 19:53.850
♫ -Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad
-Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad ♫

19:53.920 --> 19:55.860
♫ I will give you an awful shop ♫

19:55.920 --> 19:58.030
♫ So give me a good one ♫

19:58.090 --> 20:00.160
♫ -Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad
-Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad ♫

20:00.230 --> 20:02.060
♫ I will give you an empty bowl ♫

20:02.130 --> 20:04.230
♫ So give me a bowlful of rice ♫

20:04.300 --> 20:06.130
♫ -Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad
-Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad ♫

20:06.200 --> 20:08.000
♫ I will give you my tears ♫

20:08.070 --> 20:10.070
♫ So give me laughter ♫

20:10.270 --> 20:11.870
♫ -Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad

♫ -So give me a new one
-So give me a new one ♫

20:29.390 --> 20:31.190
Here comes...

20:31.730 --> 20:33.460
The secret royal inspector!

20:33.990 --> 20:35.800
The secret royal inspector!

20:37.330 --> 20:38.930
I went first.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.580
Gosh, investigating in secret
is not worth it.

20:53.750 --> 20:54.880
Move!

20:55.450 --> 20:58.150
That is our reality and fate.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.720
"He is my husband."

21:05.160 --> 21:07.490
"His Majesty is a real--"

21:08.960 --> 21:10.000
Stop it.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.770
Did I not tell you to stop?

21:16.400 --> 21:20.810
My lord, you kissed a lady
for the first time tonight.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.240
And in front of an audience at that too.

21:24.310 --> 21:26.180
What do we do?

21:27.480 --> 21:30.080
I look forward to the vigorous night
of an old bachelor.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.150
[Gwangbu: Old bachelor]

21:30.580 --> 21:32.650
An old bachelor? How dare you?

21:32.750 --> 21:35.460
Wait. We will solve this man to man.

21:35.660 --> 21:36.790
Would that not be more imposing?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.260
Give us room.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.570
These good-for-nothings.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.000
Stop it.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.010
It must have been tough,
tucking the kids into bed.

21:59.350 --> 22:00.610
It was not tough at all.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.150
By the way, do you really not know
someone called Bo-ri?

22:07.150 --> 22:08.920
Who on earth is this Bo-ri?

22:14.060 --> 22:16.730
She was a close friend of mine.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.860
Was?

22:19.430 --> 22:21.370
She passed away not too long ago.

22:24.270 --> 22:25.270
I see.

22:25.870 --> 22:28.340
That must be why you were shocked
when we first met.

22:29.340 --> 22:31.750
I heard there are people in the world

22:32.180 --> 22:34.550
with the same face.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.920
They say it is an invaluable fate
to the point you can only meet each other

22:39.090 --> 22:40.620
after crossing about 100 galaxies.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.590
That must be your fate.

22:47.390 --> 22:50.530
This is a destiny of its own,
so why not go to Ganghwa Island with us?

22:51.700 --> 22:53.230
As you may have heard earlier,

22:53.300 --> 22:55.740
anyone who wants to go will gather
and leave together.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.570
Let me know if you would like to.
Gwang-soon is going to leave too.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.270
I want to go too. I want to.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.410
I want to go with everyone!

23:02.480 --> 23:05.650
You do not even know where that is,
so how can you say that without thinking?

23:05.710 --> 23:07.380
It will not be an easy trip.

23:07.950 --> 23:10.720
I heard that is where women live
once they have returned after the war.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.820
That is enough reason for me to go.

23:12.890 --> 23:14.420
I knew it!

23:14.690 --> 23:16.120
It is as I expected!

23:16.690 --> 23:18.160
I have a good sense for such things.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.890
You are fine
with her coming with us, right?

23:20.190 --> 23:23.330
She is a fully grown woman, so why ask me?

23:23.760 --> 23:26.630
Well, it would be nice to have
a traveling companion.

23:26.870 --> 23:30.400
That reminds me, was it nice?

23:31.340 --> 23:32.310
What was?

23:32.370 --> 23:34.110
That kiss with Inspector Ra.

23:41.450 --> 23:44.920
My luggage! Right, my luggage...

23:44.990 --> 23:49.120
I left it in the kids' room. Yes, I did.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.130
I will be right back, so wait a second.

23:54.190 --> 23:56.230
Go to bed. You should go to bed first.

24:14.010 --> 24:15.550
Were you out here?

24:17.150 --> 24:18.150
I was.

24:19.190 --> 24:20.490
So were you.

24:31.630 --> 24:32.700
You must be exhausted.

24:32.770 --> 24:35.140
Why are you out here and not resting?

24:36.900 --> 24:38.000
Well...

24:39.070 --> 24:41.480
The Chinese trumpet vine
brought back old memories,

24:41.540 --> 24:42.740
so I opted for a walk.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.910
Do you know what that flower is?

24:50.180 --> 24:51.280
Of course.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.450
When I passed the state exam
with the top score,

24:54.520 --> 24:57.220
I wore a coronet
with these as embellishments.

25:08.540 --> 25:12.810
By the way, how did you know?

25:13.910 --> 25:16.110
That Cha Mal-jong's mother
called him Big Eyes.

25:17.810 --> 25:20.850
I saw that he was wearing
mismatched socks.

25:21.250 --> 25:24.750
One of them had "Big Eyes"
embroidered on it.

25:25.450 --> 25:28.290
When I was a young girl, my mother used to

25:28.420 --> 25:30.460
decorate my belongings
with embroidered butterflies.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.160
The fact that he was wearing the sock

25:35.300 --> 25:36.900
despite it being tattered

25:37.030 --> 25:39.400
made me realize
the longing he has for his mother.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.200
It is why I tried to use that against him.

25:43.070 --> 25:44.370
That was clever of you.

25:45.470 --> 25:47.940
You thought of that
even when your life was at stake.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.510
I have always been observant, you see.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.020
Right.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.320
So where will you go from here?

26:05.630 --> 26:07.560
I will be

26:08.160 --> 26:10.700
heading to Ganghwa Island
with the people here.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.730
That is a shame.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.640
I was hoping to keep you around

26:18.310 --> 26:20.970
since your wit seems to be quite useful.

26:22.740 --> 26:25.950
You showing up claiming to be my wife
saved us all.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.590
That is rich coming from someone
who did not want to be my husband.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.150
Are you now saying me being your wife

26:34.350 --> 26:35.920
saved us all?

26:37.120 --> 26:40.490
I apologize for
how I handled myself back then.

26:40.930 --> 26:42.530
But now that I think about it,

26:42.860 --> 26:46.000
pretending to be a married couple
is the perfect disguise--

26:46.070 --> 26:49.270
What will you do
if we are forced to kiss once again?

26:49.500 --> 26:52.340
As a divorcee,
I can kiss you as part of an act.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.910
However, you let us get caught
with your obvious discomfort.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.780
If it had not been my first time...

27:02.220 --> 27:05.090
Well, what I mean is that...

27:05.150 --> 27:06.620
I mean

27:06.820 --> 27:08.620
that it was my first time acting.

27:08.690 --> 27:11.990
I am not saying it was my first kiss.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.930
That is a relief.

27:17.430 --> 27:20.030
Anyway, I am not interested
in being your wife again,

27:20.100 --> 27:21.400
so look elsewhere.

27:21.470 --> 27:22.500
I will get going then.

27:22.570 --> 27:24.440
Sure, good night to you!

27:50.160 --> 27:51.530
Boys, it is time to hunt.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.070
-Yes, boss.
-Yes, boss.

28:02.480 --> 28:06.280
My lord, Soyang Guild has sent a message.

28:16.890 --> 28:18.160
You called for me, Dad?

28:18.560 --> 28:20.260
-What for?
-Tae-seo

28:20.590 --> 28:22.300
has been arrested
by a secret royal inspector.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.700
Really?

28:27.330 --> 28:28.640
He is in trouble then.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.340
Our people do not have control over
the Office of Special Justice

28:32.470 --> 28:35.940
which means we must stop him
from being transferred to Hanyang.

28:36.940 --> 28:38.180
I see.

28:39.310 --> 28:40.580
Dad,

28:41.880 --> 28:43.080
how about I get it done?

28:43.350 --> 28:44.720
It sounds like fun.

28:47.790 --> 28:51.390
[We must not let him reach
the Office of Special Justice.]

28:52.530 --> 28:53.930
If the transfer cannot be interrupted...

28:54.260 --> 28:56.230
If it cannot be interrupted,

28:57.230 --> 28:59.030
must I kill Tae-seo instead?

29:02.640 --> 29:05.840
Do-soo, Tae-seo still has

29:06.340 --> 29:08.380
a lot to do for us.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.980
Can I not just kill him?

29:12.250 --> 29:13.510
You silly boy!

29:18.150 --> 29:22.260
If you want to eliminate Tae-seo,
then you should have

29:22.590 --> 29:24.460
asked me more politely.

29:25.530 --> 29:29.260
Father, may I just eliminate him instead?

29:30.830 --> 29:33.900
Unless you want blood on your hands,
let him live.

29:34.170 --> 29:35.370
Do you understand?

29:37.140 --> 29:39.440
-Sure. I will get going then.
-Good.

29:40.140 --> 29:41.640
Do not skip your meals

29:41.910 --> 29:44.540
and try to have a balanced diet.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.410
Got it.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.150
My lord.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.980
The prisoners left for Hanyang.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.490
They threw a fit like a bunch of mad dogs.

30:26.550 --> 30:29.290
The men escorting them
almost had their arms bit off.

30:30.090 --> 30:31.220
Unbelievable.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.090
Anyway, what is all this?

30:35.130 --> 30:36.330
They are not for you.

30:39.230 --> 30:42.000
When will the ladies and children
leave for the dock?

30:43.040 --> 30:44.840
The boat leaving for Ganghwa Island

30:44.900 --> 30:47.340
will arrive at the dock in about an hour.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.140
So they will probably head out soon.

30:51.780 --> 30:53.080
About an hour?

30:54.850 --> 30:56.480
A farewell came by too soon.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.360
Here you go.

31:06.830 --> 31:08.830
Inspector Ra made the food himself.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.760
Please enjoy.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.100
Enjoy the food on the way to the dock.

31:14.230 --> 31:18.040
Here you go.
Inspector Ra's special meal box.

31:18.870 --> 31:20.010
Does it not look good?

31:23.380 --> 31:26.280
My lord, they have a lot to carry.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.620
May I escort them to the dock?

31:29.450 --> 31:30.580
Of course.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.650
-Goo-pal, you too.
-Yes, my lord.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.590
My lord, thank you for saving us.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.690
-Please be healthy.
-Thank you.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.000
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.900
-Thank you, my lord.
-Be well.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.130
Thank you.

32:07.450 --> 32:09.690
Thank you for everything.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.430
We should go. A long trip awaits us.

32:18.800 --> 32:19.700
Come on.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.770
Here. Let me carry that for you.

32:34.450 --> 32:35.920
Those who meet must part.

32:57.270 --> 32:58.370
My stomach hurts.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.440
Walk in silence.

33:00.510 --> 33:03.940
But... I cannot.

33:04.010 --> 33:06.750
Will a beating
make you come to your senses?

33:06.880 --> 33:10.620
You see, I have the most sensitive bowels.

33:10.750 --> 33:14.850
What can I do when I get the signal
out of the blue?

33:14.920 --> 33:17.160
You are asking for a beating...

33:20.790 --> 33:22.160
You sick piece of scum.

33:22.230 --> 33:24.360
I will do the deed
in my pants at this rate.

33:24.460 --> 33:27.170
Just get me out of these ropes!

33:27.630 --> 33:29.470
One has the right to take a dump

33:29.540 --> 33:31.240
even when he is being held prisoner.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.470
-Darn it.
-My stomach!

and sent me here to take a look.

49:18.180 --> 49:21.620
I do not know. I do not! I know nothing!

49:21.850 --> 49:25.220
My lord, I heard the head of the hideout

49:25.290 --> 49:27.760
is keeping their subordinates' families
as hostages

49:27.830 --> 49:30.460
to prevent information
about the hideout from getting out.

49:31.160 --> 49:33.100
Do you know anything about that place?

49:33.170 --> 49:35.000
I do not know the details,

49:35.070 --> 49:36.970
but on the birthday
of the head of the hideout,

49:37.140 --> 49:40.510
I went as far as the entrance
of the hideout with a theatrical troupe.

49:40.640 --> 49:41.770
With a theatrical troupe?

49:41.840 --> 49:44.210
Yes. From what I know,
a party is thrown every year

49:44.280 --> 49:47.910
on the head's birthday
with a theatrical troupe.

49:49.210 --> 49:50.980
Then guide me to that place.

49:51.220 --> 49:54.220
I do not mind doing so.

49:56.390 --> 50:00.290
but not even the military
can go up against them.

50:00.690 --> 50:02.860
They thoroughly check your identity,

50:02.930 --> 50:05.060
and you must be led inside
by the gatekeeper.

50:05.230 --> 50:08.670
Unless you come up with a good plan,
it is almost impossible to go in.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.740
My lord, how about

50:12.870 --> 50:15.970
asking for more soldiers from Hanyang
and attacking that place?

50:16.240 --> 50:17.580
We do not have that much time.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.050
We must attack before Park Tae-seo
and Cha Mal-jong's gang

50:20.110 --> 50:21.350
get rid of the evidence.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.020
For now, put him behind bars.

50:26.150 --> 50:27.150
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

50:27.220 --> 50:29.390
My lord, please.

50:30.290 --> 50:32.120
I must take a look
at that ledger you have.

50:34.930 --> 50:36.600
[Records of Chungcheong Provincial Office]

50:43.400 --> 50:44.570
How did this happen?

50:46.540 --> 50:49.610
I thought it was just something
she had left behind,

50:49.680 --> 50:50.740
so I was about to burn it.

50:51.710 --> 50:53.780
You threw this piece of evidence
into the fire?

50:53.950 --> 50:57.750
I did not know it was so important.

50:59.150 --> 51:01.090
We could have finished
this case in an instant

51:01.420 --> 51:03.090
if only the ledger
was in its original state.

51:03.220 --> 51:04.960
Why did you not tell me back then?

51:05.590 --> 51:09.130
Think about it. Is it normal

51:09.290 --> 51:12.530
to tell a man I have never met before,
who was wearing shabby clothes

51:12.600 --> 51:14.900
and begging for food
in someone else's house, about this?

51:14.970 --> 51:16.200
That is true.

51:21.070 --> 51:22.470
This is a tax receipt.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.610
[Josejamun: Tax receipt]

51:23.180 --> 51:25.880
No, it is not just a receipt.

51:26.310 --> 51:28.680
It is a list of those involved
in the tax embezzlement.

51:30.680 --> 51:32.250
Did you say your friend left this behind?

51:32.380 --> 51:34.390
Yes. It was one of Bo-ri's belongings.

51:36.150 --> 51:38.160
How did she come to have this?

51:40.990 --> 51:42.390
The child Bo-ri was carrying...

51:43.930 --> 51:45.700
was actually the child of the magistrate.

51:54.210 --> 51:55.310
My lord.

51:56.270 --> 51:57.910
What about the ledger?

51:59.710 --> 52:02.450
-Well...
-Tell me immediately!

52:02.510 --> 52:04.850
-I was unable to find it.
-What do you mean?

52:05.280 --> 52:07.190
Where can it be other than Gyehwa Valley?

52:07.320 --> 52:08.750
I searched every nook and cranny

52:08.820 --> 52:11.860
of the late magistrate's house, office,
the tavern of the magistrate's girl,

52:11.920 --> 52:15.290
and everywhere I could think of,
but it was nowhere to be found.

52:16.460 --> 52:18.830
But I did find this.

52:20.900 --> 52:22.000
Where is it?

52:25.370 --> 52:26.400
Here it is.

52:26.470 --> 52:27.570
Right.

52:28.140 --> 52:29.880
I found this.

52:32.710 --> 52:33.850
Is this not...

52:33.980 --> 52:36.250
I found it inside the furnace
of the tavern.

52:36.580 --> 52:37.980
The furnace?

52:38.220 --> 52:41.250
I think someone was burning
the deceased's belongings.

52:41.550 --> 52:43.320
Burning her belongings?

52:44.420 --> 52:45.490
Who would have done that?

52:45.760 --> 52:49.160
I have a hunch. A girl named Jo-yi.

52:49.290 --> 52:50.960
Then go find her!

52:51.130 --> 52:54.030
Of all things, she got a divorce
and left Gyehwa Valley.

52:54.100 --> 52:55.730
So her whereabouts are unknown.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.370
You moron!

52:57.670 --> 52:59.500
Are you seriously telling me
that is your excuse?

52:59.570 --> 53:00.770
Please spare me.

53:01.540 --> 53:05.410
If you want to live,
search all eight provinces if you have to

53:06.180 --> 53:07.880
and bring that wench called Jo-yi.

53:14.220 --> 53:16.820
The Chief Clerk of Marine Transportation,
Hong Seok-ki.

53:16.890 --> 53:18.690
[Hong Seok-ki]

53:18.860 --> 53:21.190
To think even the Chief Clerk
of Marine Transportation is involved.

53:21.990 --> 53:25.460
But why did the magistrate
of Gyehwa Valley

53:26.130 --> 53:29.030
hand the ledger over to Bo-ri

53:27.430 --> 53:30.240
[Records of Chungcheong Provincial Office]

53:29.100 --> 53:30.370
and not to Hong Seok-ki?

53:31.970 --> 53:34.940
Did Bo-ri say or do anything
out of the ordinary before she died?

53:35.340 --> 53:37.610
She said she was going to leave anyway,

53:38.110 --> 53:40.350
but I only considered it
as closing the tavern

53:40.410 --> 53:43.380
since she would probably move into
the magistrate's residence.

53:44.620 --> 53:46.180
She was going to leave anyway?

53:49.020 --> 53:50.460
Then something must have happened

53:50.790 --> 53:53.160
when she was paid a visit by someone

53:53.560 --> 53:56.230
who knew that the magistrate
left the ledger with her.

53:56.830 --> 54:00.070
Are you saying
that Bo-ri's death was not accidental

54:00.130 --> 54:01.730
and that she was murdered?

54:03.400 --> 54:04.600
It looks that way.

54:08.910 --> 54:11.440
Then, could it have been Hong Seok-ki

54:12.240 --> 54:13.480
who murdered the magistrate?

54:15.610 --> 54:17.620
[According to the mortician,
the executioner's arrow]

54:17.680 --> 54:19.720
was made of aconite root.

54:20.150 --> 54:21.220
Is aconite

54:22.420 --> 54:24.260
not medicinal herbs used in the palace?

54:24.360 --> 54:26.260
It is known as the best tonic.

54:26.660 --> 54:29.860
However, it can become
the best poison if abused.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.330
They are using aconite.

54:33.570 --> 54:35.730
What if it made its way to the palace?

54:36.870 --> 54:39.840
How deeply involved is the Chief Clerk
of Marine Transportation?

54:40.470 --> 54:42.840
Then let us find Hong Seok-ki

54:42.910 --> 54:44.740
and interrogate him first.

54:44.810 --> 54:46.310
It is not as simple as it seems.

54:46.580 --> 54:48.310
He might not lead us to the masterminds.

54:49.050 --> 54:52.480
How about we raid
the mountain hideout then?

54:52.950 --> 54:55.520
I am sure we will find
more evidence there.

54:55.790 --> 54:58.390
Besides, there are also those
that are being held captive.

54:58.460 --> 55:01.390
Like I said, going there
is not like a stroll in the park.

55:01.660 --> 55:04.430
Are you saying we should let
bad people get away with things

55:04.500 --> 55:06.360
just because it is hard to apprehend them?

55:06.600 --> 55:09.100
No, that is not what I mean.

55:10.770 --> 55:13.040
I can see you singing and dancing.

55:14.010 --> 55:15.240
Inspector Ra

55:15.340 --> 55:17.780
is having a blast
with a theatrical troupe.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.080
You--

55:21.310 --> 55:24.750
Forgive her, my lord.
Bi-ryeong sometimes gets visions.

55:24.820 --> 55:26.720
Come on, Bi-ryeong. It is all right.

55:28.490 --> 55:29.890
Did you say you saw the inspector

55:29.960 --> 55:31.760
singing and dancing
with a theatrical troupe?

55:38.530 --> 55:39.760
When did I say that?

55:41.330 --> 55:42.770
Goodness.

55:43.540 --> 55:46.300
And please watch your language.

55:46.370 --> 55:47.740
That is not how you should talk to him.

55:47.810 --> 55:50.140
Do you remember the birthday
of the head of the hideout?

55:50.740 --> 55:53.240
Well, Year of Byeongsul,

55:53.310 --> 55:56.310
Month of Gabo, Day of Imin...
Wait, it's the day after tomorrow.

55:57.180 --> 55:59.120
Gwang-soon is a reliable source.

55:59.180 --> 56:02.020
She is good with numbers
and has a good memory.

56:04.760 --> 56:06.260
-A theatrical troupe.
-A theatrical troupe.

56:08.860 --> 56:11.230
We will gain access to the hideout
as a theatrical troupe.

56:11.400 --> 56:12.830
I had the same idea.

56:12.900 --> 56:16.030
Then we will head to the market
and find a theatrical troupe.

56:17.970 --> 56:19.170
-Right now?
-Right now?

56:19.240 --> 56:20.240
-Come on.
-What?

56:21.740 --> 56:22.810
I see it!

56:26.680 --> 56:27.680
You are singing and dancing.

56:28.110 --> 56:30.580
-As if there is anything to see.
-Singing and dancing.

56:30.950 --> 56:31.980
Let's go.

56:37.860 --> 56:39.190
My lord.

56:39.690 --> 56:43.600
Your in-law's first cousin once removed
awaits you inside.

56:43.860 --> 56:46.530
-Who?
-He said you would know who he is.

56:47.070 --> 56:49.930
It seems like everyone
wants to take advantage of my status.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.070
Even though I said you were away,

56:52.140 --> 56:53.940
he insisted on waiting.

56:54.010 --> 56:56.370
When will they ever learn
to do things by themselves?

56:56.780 --> 56:58.410
Well, not this time.

57:04.050 --> 57:05.120
Scoundrels!

57:05.950 --> 57:07.990
How dare you impersonate a relative

57:08.150 --> 57:09.890
of a government official?

57:16.230 --> 57:17.900
A horse requisition tablet?

57:36.580 --> 57:38.220
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

57:38.520 --> 57:40.350
[Underage actors were managed with care.]

57:53.630 --> 57:55.400
[We thank Lee Jun-hyuk
for his special appearance.]

57:56.230 --> 57:58.640
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

57:59.040 --> 58:00.210
[Look at my shoulders.]

58:00.270 --> 58:02.140
[How can one not say they are broad?]

58:02.310 --> 58:05.110
[Jo-yi and the inspector
must have a deep connection.]

58:05.180 --> 58:06.850
[I will be the one to kill
the secret royal inspector.]

58:06.910 --> 58:08.250
[Is it because of the girl?]

58:08.510 --> 58:09.780
[It is gone.]

58:08.950 --> 58:09.910
[Distribution Receipts]

58:09.980 --> 58:13.590
[I wish to know
who is trying to cover up this crime.]

58:13.650 --> 58:15.520
[The Chief Clerk of Marine Transportation
must be dealt with first.]

58:15.590 --> 58:17.460
[He was looking for the ledger too.]

58:17.520 --> 58:19.690
The ledger?

58:19.890 --> 58:21.690
[I can do it myself, my lord.]

58:22.190 --> 58:24.530
[You are not to get injured.
That is an order.]

58:25.300 --> 58:26.300
[Let us go.]
