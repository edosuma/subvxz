WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:07.575
Previously on E.R.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.409
You did it.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.078
We have a baby.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.346
Will you be home late...
again tonight?

00:12.380 --> 00:13.581
RASGOTRA:
I've got the med list.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.315
CARTER:
Why didn't you have it before?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.416
Phenelzine?

00:15.449 --> 00:16.650
She'll be a star in Internal

00:16.684 --> 00:17.718
Medicine or research.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.120
You have to be more decisive.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.721
Should we try the
high-dose epi?

00:20.754 --> 00:22.256
I assessed it, I ordered it,

00:22.290 --> 00:23.191
I pushed it.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.258
I gave her the order.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.060
You falsified
the chart.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.428
CARTER:
That's a felony.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.197
Nothing I did
on this shift

00:29.230 --> 00:30.664
can convince me
or anyone else

00:30.698 --> 00:32.066
that I belong here.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.202
She's not ER doc.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.545 --> 00:45.813
We need more wipes.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.515
Where's your mom?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.183
She's late.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.818
Hey, nine ounces.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.453
Nice.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.687
( laughs )

00:53.721 --> 00:55.456
Can't say I
don't produce.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.557
( laughter )

00:56.590 --> 00:57.725
( doorbell rings )

00:57.758 --> 00:58.859
Better put on your shirt.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.461
She already thinks we're pervs.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.762
( laughs )
Come on, baby.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.564
You gonna be good
for your Grandma?

01:03.597 --> 01:05.699
Yeah, you're always a good boy,
aren't you?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.435
That's my baby.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.302
That's my baby.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.303
I'm sorry.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.604
My battery
was dead.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.141
I had to
get a jump.
That's all right.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.209
Hi, baby...

01:15.243 --> 01:16.810
Hands. Wait. Hands, hands.

01:16.844 --> 01:17.511
( muttering )

01:17.545 --> 01:19.147
Hi, Ma.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.282
Hi. Carlos is going
to buy me a new battery.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.816
Hmm. Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.318
What you need
is a new car, Ma.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.753
Yeah?
Preferably with
some air bags.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.321
Yes, well, you going
to buy it for me?

01:27.355 --> 01:28.389
Oh, yeah, right.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.690
My brother's a saint,

01:29.723 --> 01:31.492
'cause he's getting her
a new battery,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.327
but I got to pick up the tab
for a whole new car?

01:33.361 --> 01:34.895
Uh-huh.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.298
All right. He didn't sleep
very well last night, so

01:37.331 --> 01:39.233
Oh.
you might want
to put him down early

01:39.267 --> 01:40.268
for his morning nap.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.902
Ay, que lindo.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.673
Just like your mother,
only don't be so stubborn, okay?

01:45.706 --> 01:47.641
You ready to go, babe?

01:47.675 --> 01:48.709
Yeah.

01:48.742 --> 01:49.710
Say good-bye to Mama.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.911
Good-bye, boo.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.413
And Mommy, too.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.381
Say good-bye.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.882
( sighs )

01:54.915 --> 01:56.617
Bye, baby. Bye-bye.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.486
Come on, sweetie.
Okay.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.853
( baby crying )

01:59.887 --> 02:01.389
It's all right, papa.
Don't worry.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.490
We'll be back.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.824
Boy, your son's got a set

02:03.857 --> 02:05.493
of pipes on him, huh?

02:05.526 --> 02:07.561
Yeah? He gets that
from your side of the family.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.895
Oh, yeah?

02:08.929 --> 02:10.198
What are you
trying to say, hmm?

02:10.198 --> 02:11.465
( laughs )

02:11.499 --> 02:14.202
I got a big mouth?
( laughter )

02:14.235 --> 02:16.270
You want, uh, turkey
or peanut butter sandwich?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.705
Both.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.440
You want a turkey
with peanut butter sandwich?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.209
You used to make it
for me, remember?

02:21.209 --> 02:22.276
No, I didn't.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.345
Well, somebody did.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.280
Hey, what are sodomy laws?

02:26.314 --> 02:27.515
( knock at door )

02:27.548 --> 02:28.882
I'll get it.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.887
What are you
doing here?

02:33.921 --> 02:35.256
Just got off work.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.490
Thought I'd stop
by, say hello.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.758
Hey.

02:37.791 --> 02:41.629
Guess he misses
us or something.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.331
I have to be at work
in, like, 40 minutes,

02:43.364 --> 02:44.898
and he has to be
at school, like, now.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.867
ALEX:
You know, if he wants,
I could stay home.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.269
TAGGART:
Yeah, nice try.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.470
Come on. Gina got a ticket

02:49.503 --> 02:51.505
for double parking
last time. Go.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.873
Hey, when are
you going to stop
working night shifts?

02:52.906 --> 02:55.476
Soon.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.912
And-And what are
sodomy laws?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.748
Out.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.354
You know,

03:06.387 --> 03:09.323
I have a couple of minutes
before I have to leave.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.958
Really?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.760
Uh-huh.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.929
A lot can happen
in a few minutes.

03:15.963 --> 03:19.300
I'm sorry...

03:19.333 --> 03:20.868
It doesn't have
to be anything fancy.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.271
I'm really tired.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.475
How tired?

03:29.577 --> 03:32.280
Not that tired.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.784
LOCKHART:
How did you score?

03:36.817 --> 03:38.486
Hmm?

03:38.519 --> 03:39.620
On your boards.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.921
Don't know.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.823
I can't bring
myself to look.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.825
With any luck,
I failed.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.394
Well, that's
a positive attitude.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.628
I'm serious. Part
of me is afraid

03:47.661 --> 03:48.962
I'll actually be
given a license

03:48.996 --> 03:50.364
to practice
medicine one day.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.632
Isn't that kind of the point?

03:51.665 --> 03:52.766
When I was good
at it, yeah.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.368
Between annoying
attendings,

03:54.402 --> 03:55.969
butting heads with the nurses,
and of course,

03:56.003 --> 03:58.372
being responsible for the death
of a patient because I try

03:58.406 --> 03:59.973
to be aggressive...

04:00.007 --> 04:02.042
Oh. The writing's on the wall
for me, wouldn't you say?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.511
Well, you're not
a good doctor

04:03.544 --> 04:04.812
until you've
killed someone.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.847
Spoken like someone
who hasn't.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.749
So, how are you doing?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.484
Fine.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.620
Then I don't have much
of a poker face, do I?

04:12.653 --> 04:16.490
Abby, pilonidal cyst in Four,
Gallant shingles in Two,

04:16.524 --> 04:18.526
Neela vaginal bleeding in One.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.692
Get to work.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.060
Sorry I'm
late, Deb.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.363
I had to meet with
risk management.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.897
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.833
Uh, well, my feet are swollen,
my back is killing me,

04:25.866 --> 04:27.535
and apparently,
my waddle's too slow

04:27.568 --> 04:28.702
for some people.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.970
We got a long
day ahead of us.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.439
The sooner we start, the better.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.606
All right, we're
doing interviews

04:32.640 --> 04:33.907
on the phenelzine death.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.643
So, I'll need some time
off the floor.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.710
Are we being sued?

04:36.744 --> 04:37.945
MAN:
Not yet. Just need

04:37.978 --> 04:39.547
to clarify
the hospital's defense.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.782
All right, Gallant,
you're up last at 11:30.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.084
Actually, the attending's
up last since he's the one

04:44.117 --> 04:45.419
who'll be named in the suit.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.854
God knows Carter's got assets.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.456
That why he leave the country?

04:48.489 --> 04:49.890
All right, we'll start
at the bottom

04:49.923 --> 04:51.459
and work our way up.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.893
Neela, that's you.
What? The guy's

04:52.926 --> 04:54.428
medical records fell
through the cracks.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.496
It's not like

04:55.529 --> 04:57.064
anyone did anything wrong.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.883
What's the matter
with you, man?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.051
I'm telling you,
this chick is hot.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.019
A little overweight,
but in a good way.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.153
Look, I'm not interested, man.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.488
Mike, she's
your type.
I'm busy.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.589
You got Lieutenant James
on line one.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.790
Tell him I'll call back.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.058
Busy doing what,
playing soldier?

05:58.091 --> 05:59.126
Man, you need
to get a life.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.528
Dr. Gallant,
did you treat

06:00.561 --> 06:02.430
the immersion burn
in Exam Four?

06:02.463 --> 06:03.431
Yeah. There a problem?
Did I tell you she's
a college grad?

06:03.464 --> 06:04.865
No. Not at all. I thought

06:04.898 --> 06:06.634
you did an excellent job
with the debridement.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.901
Magna cum laude.
Ever consider switching
to surgery?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.470
It's never too late, you know.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.704
I think I'm pretty
well committed.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.005
Oh, well,
if you change your mind.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.541
The chick has legs
up to here.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.443
Dr. Pratt.
You're playing
games.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.844
Susan's with risk management
so you'll need to present to me.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.580
Yeah, okay.
You all right?
Yeah. Why?

06:19.613 --> 06:20.948
Well, how's your dad doing?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.082
Oh, he's much
better, thanks.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.717
Okay.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.152
We have a, uh,

06:25.185 --> 06:27.455
homeless John Doe,
approximately 70 years old,

06:27.455 --> 06:29.657
found in a makeshift tent
in Lincoln Park,

06:29.690 --> 06:31.091
cold and altered.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.660
His, uh, sugar's at 435,

06:32.693 --> 06:35.463
so I gave him eight units
of insulin subq.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.164
Yeah. How long has
he been outside?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.099
Rectal temp's 92.3.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.100
Overnight?

06:40.133 --> 06:41.502
( grunts )

06:41.535 --> 06:43.537
Diabetic ulcerations
on the feet.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.173
PRATT:
He also has high
blood pressure-- 180/95

06:46.206 --> 06:48.175
and evidence
of a prior MI on the EKG.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.810
Pretty bad cataracts, too.

06:49.843 --> 06:50.911
Sure he's homeless?

06:50.944 --> 06:53.046
Well, it fits the bill, right?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.181
Nails are groomed.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.616
Check missing persons.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.984
Maybe he's a wanderer.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.185
Sir. Sir...

06:58.218 --> 06:59.219
Oh.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.187
Great.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.622
( laughs )

07:01.655 --> 07:02.956
Here.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.859
Seems like
he's incontinent, too.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.528
CORDAY:
Kerry,

07:07.561 --> 07:08.896
my department's
in utter chaos.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.764
Since Robert,
there's been no leadership,

07:10.798 --> 07:12.500
scheduling's
a bloody nightmare

07:12.500 --> 07:13.834
and there's nobody
representing us

07:13.867 --> 07:15.035
at the bargaining table.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.504
Our salaries
have been cut back.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.838
I know.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.540
Well, what are you going
to do about it?

07:19.573 --> 07:20.974
Have the new Surgery
Department head

07:21.008 --> 07:23.043
assess the situation and
get back to me about it.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.545
You selected a chairman?

07:24.578 --> 07:25.913
Dr. Weaver,
Sandy on line two.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.715
Chairwoman. Can you
find out if it's urgent?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.650
Unless you prefer to
be gender-nonspecific

07:29.683 --> 07:31.084
and simply referred
to as Chair.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.185
It's only about dinner.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.654
You can call her back.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.755
Good. I'm late
for a medical

07:34.788 --> 07:35.923
executive committee meeting.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.090
I don't understand.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.559
When was this decided?

07:38.592 --> 07:39.760
Two months ago,
something like that.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.061
Still need
final approval,

07:41.094 --> 07:42.696
but that shouldn't
be an issue.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.264
Uh, well, that's fine,

07:44.297 --> 07:45.766
but it would've been nice
to have been asked.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.234
Three months maybe?
I-I don't know.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.002
Something like that.
You don't want it?

07:49.036 --> 07:50.538
Maybe. I don't know.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.005
Still, it-it would
have been nice

07:52.039 --> 07:53.974
to be given a choice
in the matter.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.176
How long has your back been
hurting, Mr. Halpern?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.578
Uh, couple
of days now.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.547
Did you fall
or strain yourself?

07:59.580 --> 08:01.949
I slipped on the stairs
about a week ago.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.717
Might have triggered
something.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.019
I... I had a slipped disk
a few years back.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.555
Did you have
surgery for it?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.622
No, no.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.223
I couldn't afford it.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.959
It-It just flares up once
in awhile.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.027
I usually just take Vicodin.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.596
Let me guess.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.598
You're allergic to Tylenol
and ibuprofen,

08:17.631 --> 08:19.667
and Vicodin is the only thing
that works.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.569
Yeah. I don't really
like the stuff, but

08:21.569 --> 08:23.604
you know, what am I going
to do, you know?

08:23.637 --> 08:24.938
Abby?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.607
T and L spine
and get some urine?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.742
Yup. We'll be
right back.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.613
Then run a tox screen,
check his records,

08:32.645 --> 08:33.881
make sure he's
not drug-seeking.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.182
You read my mind.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.017
So, you think you'll
match at County?

08:37.049 --> 08:38.184
( laughs )

08:38.217 --> 08:40.120
I don't know.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.089
So, you basically
let a desk clerk
get in the way

08:42.121 --> 08:43.890
of your getting
a medical history.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.192
I suppose I did.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.927
And did you inform
Dr. Gallant

08:46.960 --> 08:48.596
that you didn't have
Mr. Sanchez's current med list?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.030
Yes.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.298
And yet he gave the order
for Demerol?

08:51.331 --> 08:52.700
Yes.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.604
Do you have anything else?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.305
No, I'm good.

08:58.338 --> 09:02.009
LEWIS:
Okay. Thanks, Neela.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.176
Oh, by the way,
I have a friend

09:03.210 --> 09:04.778
who's doing a study

09:04.812 --> 09:06.079
on neuroprotective
agents in stroke.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.247
And they're looking
for students

09:07.280 --> 09:08.616
to work part-time in the lab.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.850
Research?

09:11.619 --> 09:13.020
Just check it out.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.158
CHEN:
This is crazy.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.727
If Susan knew she was going

09:19.760 --> 09:21.228
to be in some inquisition
all day,

09:21.261 --> 09:22.996
she should have scheduled
another attending.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.798
Abby, chest pain, scalp
lac, itchy groin rash.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.634
I've already got eight
on the board.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.268
And I've got twelve.
What's your point?

09:28.301 --> 09:30.037
Dr. Chen, old frozen guy's
waking up.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.238
He asked for some water.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.206
Oh, hey, uh, Kovac called.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.308
He said next time he's going
to have a triple latte first.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.309
Does that make sense?

09:36.343 --> 09:37.778
Yeah.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.012
Aren't you two
living together now?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.180
No.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.649
Well, for what's
it's worth,

09:41.649 --> 09:42.983
I think Luka's
a good guy.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.685
Uh, wait, you didn't...
Sleep with him? Nah.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.655
I went in a completely
different direction.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.023
Hi, I'm Dr. Chen.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.192
Can you tell me
your name, sir?

09:53.694 --> 09:55.228
Jones.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.897
First name is Bob.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.668
Is there any family
we can contact, Bob?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.035
No. No.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.671
I'm homeless.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.707
Mr. Jones,
your hemoglobin A1C suggests

10:06.740 --> 10:10.678
that your diabetes was
under control until recently.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.846
What happened?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.317
No missing persons report
that fits.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.019
( sighs )

10:19.052 --> 10:20.754
Well, we'll just have
to call social services,

10:20.788 --> 10:22.055
get him placed somewhere.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.323
Yes.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.093
I need somewhere to live.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.130
All right, recheck d-stick
and urine ketone...

10:30.163 --> 10:32.065
You know what?
Why am I doing this?

10:32.099 --> 10:33.934
He's Pratt's patient.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.705
So, the clonopin's working?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.206
Okay, no.
That's good.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.675
Just, uh, give me a call
if he gets agitated again.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.710
All right.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.011
What are you doing?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.412
I was talking
to your father's nurse.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.014
She tried to call,
but you were busy.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.415
Seems like he tried
to fry a steak

10:48.448 --> 10:49.783
while she was stripping his bed.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.084
What?

10:51.118 --> 10:52.820
Yeah. He set off all
the smoke alarms,

10:52.853 --> 10:54.254
scared himself up pretty good,
but he's okay now.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.889
Oh, my God.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.758
I gave her verbal orders
for P.R.N. clonopin.

10:57.791 --> 10:58.926
It has a long
half-life.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.260
But you might want

11:00.293 --> 11:01.962
to consider
restraints, though.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.430
Dr. Chen, Rescue 3-8
has, uh, two critical

11:03.463 --> 11:04.965
and six serious
from a structure
fire collapse.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.734
Okay, give it to me.
I'll call resp,

11:06.734 --> 11:08.401
make sure they have a couple
of vents ready.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.837
Page trauma and
burn fellows,

11:09.870 --> 11:11.271
set up the
rapid infusers

11:11.304 --> 11:13.874
and get Lewis out
of that damn meeting.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.744
She discovered that he once
had a bad reaction to morphine,

11:16.777 --> 11:18.011
and sought out an alternative.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.780
It was smart on her part.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.749
But she didn't tell you
what that alternative was?

11:21.749 --> 11:23.283
No. Not specifically.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.752
Did you hear
Dr. Gallant
give the order

11:24.785 --> 11:27.120
to push Demerol?

11:27.154 --> 11:29.056
No,

11:29.089 --> 11:31.024
but to be fair, I had stepped
out of the room briefly.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.025
What are you guys

11:32.059 --> 11:33.360
looking for exactly?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.128
The truth.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.097
Meaning you think
there's some sort of cover-up?

11:37.130 --> 11:38.331
( knock at door )

11:38.365 --> 11:39.900
Excuse me, Dr. Lewis.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.935
F.D.'s rolling up
with criticals.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.241
What have we got?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.944
Tommy Mason, 33,
full thickness burns

11:50.978 --> 11:52.780
to the face,
neck and chest.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.081
Unconscious
at the scene.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.383
BP's 90 palp,
tubed for agonal resps.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.085
Residential
fire?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.419
Abandoned warehouse.
Should've let it burn.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.420
Nobody inside to save.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.922
Sam, Gallant, you take

12:01.955 --> 12:04.057
the next one,
Pratt, you come with me.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.258
What happened?

12:05.292 --> 12:06.426
Industrial fire.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.828
17 got hit
pretty bad.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.329
How'd your meeting go?
Fine.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.065
Ah, watch it!

12:12.099 --> 12:13.801
Andy Fash, 22,
smoke inhalation.

12:13.834 --> 12:14.902
Passed out and
took a fall.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.303
Dislocated knee.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.938
BP's 132/80.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.372
Complains of
belly pain.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.908
Good pulse on the foot.
Pelvis is stable.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.242
It's okay, I'm cool.
How's Mason?

12:22.275 --> 12:24.011
We don't know yet.
I'll get the next one.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.079
This the second critical?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.247
Next rig.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.448
It took awhile
to fish her out.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.817
Abby, you
take this one.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.118
By myself?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.552
Yeah. Chen and Pratt
in the next door.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.287
Gallant, Neela,
you're with me.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.889
OLBES:
29-year-old female,
chest and pelvis crush.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.825
Injury on scene
with prolonged extrication.

12:37.858 --> 12:38.826
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.860
RASGOTRA:
Oh my God.

12:39.893 --> 12:40.961
It's Sandy.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.195
Hey, Doc.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.497
Got a flash. Wire.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.033
Sandy, you need
to stay still, okay.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.935
BP's 80 palp.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.870
Tell Gemmill to stop trying
to get a look at my boobs.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.371
Chest is up.
Multiple rib fractures.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.240
Pneumothorax. She
needs a chest tube.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.008
I was about to say that.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.844
( alarm beeping )
Pulse ox is down to 78.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.011
How about one of you doing it,
instead of talking about it?

12:58.045 --> 12:59.112
Ten blade.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.280
Tegaderm for the line.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.915
Sandy, how
are you doing?

13:01.949 --> 13:04.184
I've been better.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.285
I remember you.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.054
How's the baby?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.588
You have carbonaceous
material in both nares.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.024
We need to think about
securing your airway.

13:11.058 --> 13:14.294
You wanna shut me up by sticking
a tube down my throat, huh?

13:14.327 --> 13:15.963
We want to help you breathe
better.

13:15.996 --> 13:20.033
I want to...
I want to talk to Kerry first.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.971
You cut in the fifth intercostal
space, mid-axillary line.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.572
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.275
Free fluid in both
pericolic gutters.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.342
Sandy, you need the OR.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.378
We're going to have to intubate.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.914
( gasping ):
What's taking her so long?

13:33.947 --> 13:34.581
I paged her.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.316
Okay, I'm in.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.085
Please...

13:38.118 --> 13:40.453
Okay, okay.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.223
Put her on 100% non rebreather,

13:43.256 --> 13:45.192
but the minute she gets down
here, I'm going to intubate you.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.894
We need another
doc in here.
Go, Gallant.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.395
I have to sew in
the chest tube.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.130
No, they don't want a student,
they want a doc.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.965
Neela, have you ever done
a horizontal mattress?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.033
Yes.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.367
Dazzle me.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.203
What do you need?

13:56.236 --> 14:00.040
CHEN:
Glove up-- 60% surface area
burns with hypoxia.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.508
Guy needs an escharotomy.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.376
Wide prep. 10 blades for the
both of us.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.079
We'll open a square over the
entire chest down to the subq.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.048
BP's down to 70 palp.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.483
Gallant, check the ET for a
leak, may have to reintubate.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.219
Yes, ma'am.
Ready?

14:12.252 --> 14:13.520
Every time.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.990
Anterior axillary line,

14:17.024 --> 14:18.458
all the way down
to the tenth rib.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.260
Join the top and bottom

14:20.293 --> 14:21.628
transversely.
All right, Mike,

14:21.661 --> 14:24.231
you should be able
to bag him now.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.565
Nope. Sats are dropping.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.334
Hold up, 18 angiocath.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.235
What?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.236
Tracheal shift.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.370
Found a puncture wound,

14:30.403 --> 14:31.338
tension pneumo on the left.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.472
Gotta needle him.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.975
Hemostat and four-oh vicryl.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.044
Pulse is stronger,
sats coming up.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.645
Nice catch, Gallant.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.981
Hey, Abby needs some help in
here with a knee reduction.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.315
Pratt.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.616
I'm in the middle of
tying off a bleeder.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.953
Gallant can take over.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.023
GALLANT:
Sterile gloves.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.491
What's up?

14:51.524 --> 14:53.293
Lateral dislocation with
equivocal pedal pulses.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.462
Mild wheezing. Maybe has
some smoke inhalation.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.130
Is he hanging in there?

14:57.164 --> 14:58.498
His chest was burned so bad
he couldn't breathe.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.267
He's intubated and doing
a little bit better.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.701
MALIK:
Systolic's 120
with 50 on board.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.702
What about Lopez?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.204
We don't know yet.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.705
He's had 250 mikes
of Fentanyl.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.640
I told the old-timers
I'd race 'em to the top.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.276
All right, man,
this is gonna hurt.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.677
We have to pull
on your lower leg

15:10.710 --> 15:12.479
and move it back up
onto the knee.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.047
17 years on the job between 'em.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.315
I got eight months...

15:15.348 --> 15:16.616
Come on, stabilize
the distal femur.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.285
Let's get ready to pull.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.719
Tommy got up there first,
then Sandy...

15:19.752 --> 15:21.354
You got enough countertraction?

15:21.388 --> 15:22.622
I remember thinking
the old guy won...

15:22.655 --> 15:23.991
Yeah. You ready?

15:23.991 --> 15:26.059
Then I saw 'em both drop...

15:26.093 --> 15:27.627
One, two, three...

15:27.660 --> 15:29.997
( Fesh screaming )

15:32.199 --> 15:33.233
Where's Sandy?

15:33.266 --> 15:34.334
Trauma One.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.368
How bad is it?

15:35.402 --> 15:36.669
She's conscious.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.372
WEAVER:
Excuse me. Excuse me.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.142
Crit's 24
after two units.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.112
Sandy?

15:45.145 --> 15:46.279
Oh, God.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.680
Hey, baby...

15:47.714 --> 15:49.082
What'd you go
and do?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.383
Roof collapsed.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.519
Bilateral rib fractures,
pneumothorax,

15:52.552 --> 15:54.687
intra-abdominal bleed,
pubic rami fractures.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.456
We need to get her
to the OR.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.691
It's a good thing I pumped, huh?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.627
Chest tube output's
slowing down.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.162
Pulse ox 87...

16:02.195 --> 16:03.430
She's on a hundred percent?

16:03.463 --> 16:04.697
Yeah.
Why isn't she intubated?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.199
She refused it
till you got here.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.669
I only wanted to say hey.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.271
Type specific's here.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.206
It's gonna be okay.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.043
Sandy...
( alarm beeping )

16:16.076 --> 16:17.377
( snapping fingers )
Sandy.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.745
Sandy, you need to stay awake,
sweetie.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.380
You need to stay
awake, Sandy!

16:20.413 --> 16:22.349
20 of etomidate
and 120 of sux.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.084
Pressure's drifting down.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.052
Sandy, you need
to stay awake.
8-oh tube?

16:25.052 --> 16:26.386
And a number two mac.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.055
Sandy... Sandy!
I need to do this.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.322
Sats in the 70s--
we should be bagging.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.190
Uh, Kerry.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.691
Push the drugs.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.161
I need an end-tidal
CO2 detector.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.462
Etomidate first?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.164
Kerry, you need
to let us do this.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.466
No. Please... she's my wife.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.304
How long am I going
to be in this?

16:44.337 --> 16:47.607
When you dislocate, you tear up
a bunch of knee ligaments.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.442
Those heal, right?

16:49.476 --> 16:51.711
Even with surgery, still
could be some instability.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.583
I've wanted to do this
since I was a kid, you know?

16:56.616 --> 16:58.718
There are some new
artificial ligaments,

16:58.751 --> 17:01.654
but if it's really bad,
you may need knee replacement.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.623
Mason says it's a calling.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.627
So what happens
when you can't answer it?

17:09.628 --> 17:10.696
Good pulses, he's stable.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.098
Keep an eye on his airway.

17:12.132 --> 17:12.765
I'll see if they
need me next door.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.201
What happened?

17:14.233 --> 17:15.734
Must be a
cardiac injury.

17:15.768 --> 17:16.736
I lost the pulse.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.137
Start compressions.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.739
Thoracotomy tray
to Dr. Gallant.

17:19.771 --> 17:20.740
You're serious?

17:20.772 --> 17:21.741
Why not?

17:21.773 --> 17:23.210
He's earned it.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.611
10 blade then
Mayo scissors.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.747
Put up a screen.
They don't need to see this.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.117
Okay, rib spreader.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.225
Open the pericardium
with the metz.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.493
Stay anterior or you'll
cut the phrenic nerve.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.330
You do remember the anatomy
of the phrenic nerve?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.737
Edema and secretions...

17:50.770 --> 17:52.672
Tube's not advancing.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.773
You asked for an eight-oh.

17:53.806 --> 17:54.841
BP 108 over 68.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.276
Come on, come on, honey.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.877
Switch to a seven
and a half?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.146
Come on,
you can do this.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.680
Sats 83, 82...

18:00.713 --> 18:02.282
I'm switching to
fiberoptic scope.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.783
Suction
and crichoid.

18:03.816 --> 18:04.851
81, 80...

18:04.884 --> 18:05.852
Kerry?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.554
I see cords.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.555
Get her a tube.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.556
79, 78...

18:09.589 --> 18:10.623
I'm in.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.824
Bag her.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.863
Good yellow on
the CO2 monitor.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.565
Pressure's 120 palp.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.267
Another four of Ativan
and six of Pavulon.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.401
You okay, Dr. Weaver?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.802
Portable vent?

18:22.835 --> 18:24.404
Just keep
bagging her.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.208
Okay, Mr. Fesh,
we're going to
move you to...

18:28.241 --> 18:29.376
( gasping )
You all right?

18:29.409 --> 18:30.410
I can't breathe.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.212
I think I hear
stridor.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.748
Okay. Try continuous
albuterol at 20
per hour. Pratt?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.517
Pratt, I need you
in here.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.252
I think this in here needs
me a little bit more.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.553
I'll start
an atrial line.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.821
He needs four units now.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.523
Okay, we can
try a foley.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.657
He's diaphoretic.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.459
This guy's in respiratory
distress.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.894
He must have an upper
airway burn.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.262
Crank up the O2.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.597
Ventricle's starting to fill.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.731
Come on, crank it up.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.866
Abby, does he need intubation?

18:53.900 --> 18:56.603
PRATT:
Just bag him, I'll be
there in a few minutes.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.205
All right, ambu mask at 100%.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.672
What's happening?

18:59.706 --> 19:01.374
Okay, you need to try
to relax, all right?

19:01.408 --> 19:02.442
Just relax.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.244
No reading on the pulse ox.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.812
He's out.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.847
All right, try a jaw thrust.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.782
There's no chest excursion.

19:09.816 --> 19:10.850
I can't bag him.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.419
20cc's for the balloon.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.420
Extend his neck.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.554
We did.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.323
Good hemostasis with the foley.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.890
Another two units
and we just might save this guy.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.626
Okay, fine-- etomidate and sux.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.860
You got it.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.229
Push the drugs, Abby.
One of us

19:22.229 --> 19:23.863
will be
right there.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.332
Run of six.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.433
Heart's still empty.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.900
Where's he losing it?

19:27.934 --> 19:30.537
Abby, try a six-oh. Take a look.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.239
Okay, sponge stick
and more suction.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.241
Clamp the hilar vessels.
Abby, what do you see?

19:34.241 --> 19:35.742
Nothing!

19:35.775 --> 19:37.777
( quietly ):
Larynx is swollen shut.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.246
Sats are down to 72.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.613
This is ridiculous.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.881
I can't ventilate him.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.416
Just keep bagging.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.918
I'll be right there
in a second.

19:45.952 --> 19:49.622
All right, 11 blade
and a five shiley.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.424
What?
You heard me.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.459
All right.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.760
Okay, hilum's clamped.

19:53.793 --> 19:54.694
So's the aorta.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.928
V-tach.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.466
Internal paddles.
Charge to 30.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.901
Clear.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.771
Abby, how you
doing in there?
You okay?

20:04.804 --> 20:05.972
Yup.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.477
Tube and curved kelly.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.312
Ectopy on the monitor.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.916
You do this before?

20:16.949 --> 20:18.351
Nope.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.021
Charged.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.790
Clear.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.592
No change.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.559
Amp of epi.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.660
Sixty.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.928
Charged.
Never mind.

20:28.961 --> 20:29.929
What?
Clear.

20:29.962 --> 20:30.963
I criked him.

20:30.997 --> 20:31.998
By yourself?

20:32.031 --> 20:34.434
Sats are up,
he's fine.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.735
Now, that's
a med student.

20:35.768 --> 20:36.936
Going again.
100 of lidocaine.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.271
Charged.

20:38.305 --> 20:38.938
Clear.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.507
Still V-fib.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.675
Asystole.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.043
Okay, come on, five of epi.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.011
High dose could get us
a shockable rhythm.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.946
Stop compressions.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.316
Don't bother, man.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.983
12:27.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.019
Should we let
those guys in?

20:53.052 --> 20:55.288
After we close the chest.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.958
Oh silk on a needle driver.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.996
BP's only 82 over 60.
You want more blood?

21:04.030 --> 21:06.399
Another two units
and squeeze in the FFP.

21:06.433 --> 21:10.002
Fractured liver,
pelvis, ribs, humerus...

21:10.036 --> 21:11.604
God, what's not broken?

21:11.638 --> 21:13.673
Kerry, do you have
the C-spine film?

21:13.706 --> 21:15.375
It's Sandy.
What?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.344
Oh, God.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.381
Who's operating?

21:21.414 --> 21:25.852
Anspaugh hopefully,
and Dean.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.988
Ignacio's anesthesia,
Shirley's circulating.

21:29.021 --> 21:29.989
Good, that's good.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.358
Platelets are here.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.859
Do you want to stay with her?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.794
What?

21:34.827 --> 21:36.396
Would you like to observe?

21:36.429 --> 21:38.531
Yes. Yes, I would

21:38.565 --> 21:39.866
Right. Um...

21:39.899 --> 21:41.968
Chest tube on water seal.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.436
You got it.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.537
Really cool of you,
by the way.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.006
The O.R.'s ready.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.942
All right, let's go then.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.044
I'll say a prayer for you,
Dr. Weaver.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.782
Kerry, she'll pull through.
She's a fighter.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.552
I'm right here, Sandy.
I'm not going anywhere.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.488
Have the blood bank
send four units upstairs.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.655
SAM:
They're already
ahead six.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.391
HUTCH:
How is she?

22:04.391 --> 22:06.092
Her lung collapsed.
We were able to reinflate it.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.628
She's lacerated her liver,
which we need to repair
right away.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.863
Mija... oh, my God...

22:10.897 --> 22:13.032
What happened?
Where are you taking her?

22:13.065 --> 22:16.035
Try not to be scared.
She needs an operation.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.870
Sandy.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.739
Mija...

22:19.772 --> 22:21.107
¿me puedes oir?

22:21.140 --> 22:22.875
Mija?

22:22.909 --> 22:24.711
She's not
conscious, ma'am.

22:24.744 --> 22:25.712
Where's Henry?

22:25.745 --> 22:27.046
With my wife.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.681
Is Sandy going
to be all right?

22:28.715 --> 22:31.050
Yes. Uh, I will be with her
in the O.R.,

22:31.083 --> 22:32.985
but there's a waiting room
upstairs...

22:33.019 --> 22:35.522
and I'll call you the minute
that she gets out of surgery.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.156
Take care of her.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.825
We will.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.126
I'll take 'em up.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.061
WOMAN:
No...

22:42.094 --> 22:44.130
No... no...

22:44.163 --> 22:46.466
( sobbing ):
No!

22:52.439 --> 22:54.774
I can tell you
exactly what happened.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.443
We-we had a very recent
discharge summary

22:56.443 --> 22:59.812
documenting an adverse reaction
to morphine.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.648
The patient was in pain.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.150
I gave the order
to administer Demerol.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.486
I shouldn't have. End of story.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.187
Not exactly.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.523
LEVINE:
Luis Sanchez's chart
is incomplete.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.793
No attending note.
Any idea why that is?

23:13.826 --> 23:15.995
Well, maybe Dr. Carter
didn't have a chance to do it

23:16.028 --> 23:18.164
before it was sequestered
by legal.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.199
He was leaving for
Africa that night, so...

23:20.232 --> 23:22.835
So he was a little distracted
is what you're saying.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.604
No, I'm not saying that at all.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.640
Do you think he needed time
to get his facts straight?

23:27.674 --> 23:29.809
What? No. It w...
it was a busy night.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.812
We had a lot of patients.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.982
Is Dr. Carter typically
available to you?

23:37.149 --> 23:39.519
Of course he is.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.854
What are you doing?
I thought you were supposed
to help us here.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.857
I am... by preparing you
for the difficult questioning

23:44.891 --> 23:46.726
you may face
in a deposition.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.162
Do you feel supported
by Dr. Carter as an attending?

23:50.196 --> 23:53.165
( sighs ):
Yes. He's a great teacher.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.502
He's one of the finest
physicians I've worked with,

23:55.535 --> 23:57.870
and I respect his opinion
tremendously.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.172
So why didn't you present
to him?

24:00.206 --> 24:02.875
LEWIS:
It just doesn't
make sense,

24:02.909 --> 24:05.845
because he was
probably 30 feet
away the whole time.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.147
Was Dr. Carter informed
of the decisions

24:08.180 --> 24:10.016
you were making
in your treatment plan?

24:14.020 --> 24:17.524
No.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.893
I wanted to handle it myself.

24:20.927 --> 24:24.030
I thought I was better
at this job than I guess I am.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.798
I'm completely
responsible.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.534
Nobody else is.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.736
Will you state if deposed?

24:29.769 --> 24:32.872
Yes.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.808
When is that
supposed to take place?

24:35.842 --> 24:38.177
A deposition?
We're not sure.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.112
We haven't heard
from the family yet.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.684
I might not be able to do it
for awhile.

24:44.717 --> 24:45.985
Why is that?

24:46.953 --> 24:50.189
The Army called me up.

24:50.222 --> 24:53.192
I'm going to be deployed
to Iraq.

24:58.598 --> 25:02.068
Excuse me.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.070
Whatever, you know?
I got Chris Halpern's
medical records.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.938
Even just a half an hour--
be nice to see you.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.206
That's all
I was thinking.
Gallant?

25:07.239 --> 25:08.908
Oh, uh, Halpern, right.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.242
Refresh my memory.
Call me back.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.878
Desperately
seeking Vicodin.
Love you.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.580
Yeah...
Hey, did you
hear anything

25:13.613 --> 25:14.581
about Sandy Lopez?

25:14.581 --> 25:15.882
No. You?

25:15.915 --> 25:18.050
Puts it in perspective, huh?

25:18.084 --> 25:20.086
So, Mr. Halpern managed
to hit up

25:20.119 --> 25:22.589
every local hospital
for Vicodin this year.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.256
You want to know what
his tox screen showed?

25:24.290 --> 25:25.692
What, narcotics and benzos?

25:25.725 --> 25:26.926
Nope. Nothing.
He's clean.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.595
Aspirin and caffeine.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.262
Uh, excuse me.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.665
I'm wondering if you could
find out about my sister.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.101
The guys told me she was
in surgery and you might know.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.068
You're Sandy's brother.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.204
I'm one of 'em. She okay?

25:38.237 --> 25:40.740
Uh, let me make a call.
Thanks.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.242
Falciform ligament clamped.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.944
DEAN:
Systolic's in the 90's.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.113
SHIRLEY:
Two more units
going in.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.915
How long have you two
been together?

25:48.948 --> 25:50.249
Ready the cell saver.

25:50.282 --> 25:51.984
Three years.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.621
One of which included
a pregnancy.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.989
That gets you bonus time
in the equation.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.091
Okay, there's lots
of blood. Suction.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.793
Uh, looks venous.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.129
SHIRLEY:
Hemocue's 8.3.

26:07.299 --> 26:10.136
We met here.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.238
At the hospital?

26:14.106 --> 26:17.977
That's the last place
I expected to find anyone.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.378
Right, uh, the spleen

26:19.411 --> 26:22.815
looks good... but...

26:22.849 --> 26:25.918
there's a grade four
hepatic lac.

26:25.952 --> 26:26.919
Bovie.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.921
I miss Mark, too.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.323
Let's pack off the liver.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.260
Shirley, Shirley,
can you wipe my brow?

26:36.328 --> 26:38.898
Lap pads.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.900
I need lots of them.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.102
Neela, what's the
therapeutic range
of procainamide?

26:43.135 --> 26:46.038
Four to ten mikes per mil,
but you also have to measure
its active metabolite.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.307
Procain plus NAPA
should be under 40.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.342
Did you open that
envelope yet?

26:50.376 --> 26:53.012
Yes.
And let me guess:
you passed.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.981
Yes.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.016
And you're not
in the least bit
excited about that?

26:57.049 --> 26:59.018
I'm a little excited
about it, I suppose.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.020
Don't have to tell my parents
I flunked the boards.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.321
I don't know.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.724
I'm not sure
it means anything...

27:04.757 --> 27:07.860
but I suppose we should at least
go celebrate passing tonight.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.329
Well, I'm not much
in the mood myself.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.198
Yeah.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.336
Susan... what
are you doing?

27:17.369 --> 27:20.039
Please let these be
Braxton-Hicks.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.373
( beeping )
What's wrong?

27:21.407 --> 27:23.275
You need to isolate
the segmental veins.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.276
Trying...

27:24.310 --> 27:26.345
Kerry.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.214
How is she doing?

27:28.247 --> 27:30.082
SHIRLEY:
Systolic's down to 78.
She must have

27:30.116 --> 27:31.751
a retrohepatic
caval injury.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.085
Oh, God...

27:33.119 --> 27:34.854
Okay, clamp
the suprarenal I.V.C.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.023
ANSPAUGH:
All right,
I'll take over.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.192
Large angled Satinsky.

27:40.226 --> 27:43.229
Come on, baby... please don't
scare me like this.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.765
I.V.C. clamped.
Mark time.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.967
( alarm ringing )
C.V.P. dropped to zero.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.070
Uh, start an epi infusion.
Keep her temp up.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.373
All right, suprahepatic
cava clamped.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.743
You sure you should be
in here?

27:56.776 --> 27:58.477
She's fine.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.246
SHIRLEY:
Bradycardia.

28:00.279 --> 28:03.049
Oh... she's lost her
filling pressure.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.483
Can you unclamp?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.118
If we do, she'll
bleed out.
And if we don't,

28:06.152 --> 28:08.755
her heart stays
empty and she arrests.

28:08.755 --> 28:09.756
Oh, God.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.290
Systolic's only 60.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.060
Mig of atropine. Let's prep
the chest for a Schrock.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.094
Ten blade.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.896
Heart rate's down to 58.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.497
Sternal saw.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.432
Kerry, we have to put
in an atrio-caval shunt

28:20.466 --> 28:22.835
In order to do
that, we have to
open up the chest.

28:22.869 --> 28:26.072
It'll improve her
preload and get blood
back to the heart.

28:26.105 --> 28:26.505
Kerry.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.774
Do it.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.343
( sternal saw buzzing )

28:33.412 --> 28:35.782
Nicotine, coffee
and aspirin.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.017
Setting yourself up
for an ulcer.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.186
I don't drink coffee.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.021
Okay, soda then.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.191
Lot of caffeine
in your system.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.226
Over-the-counter
migraine tablets.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.028
They don't do
squat, though.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.163
Nothing works
but Imitrex.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.234
That's a pretty expensive
medication...

28:55.267 --> 28:58.037
especially for someone
who doesn't work much,

28:58.070 --> 28:59.371
not insured anywhere.

28:59.405 --> 29:03.242
Yeah, well, thanks
a lot, Uncle Sam.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.512
How long have you
had the headaches?

29:06.545 --> 29:11.183
Ever since I pulled sand duty
in the Gulf.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.819
What branch?

29:13.519 --> 29:14.987
Army.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.388
Yeah, me, too.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.993
Don't count on the benefits.

29:21.027 --> 29:23.963
I spend a year in the desert,
came home with migraines.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.232
The V.A. says
it's not service-related.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.234
Won't give me a dime.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.205
That why you
sell the Vicodin?

29:33.239 --> 29:36.208
Pay for the Imitrex?

29:37.576 --> 29:40.546
What unit?

29:40.579 --> 29:45.084
43rd Battalion,
Medical Corp.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.119
You going to turn me in?

29:48.020 --> 29:50.089
No.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.526
But I'm not going to give you
the Vicodin, either.

29:54.560 --> 29:58.297
That's fair enough.

29:58.330 --> 30:02.101
You stay low...
watch your back.

30:04.536 --> 30:08.540
You didn't say how
your meeting went.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.578
( sighs ):
It's going to be fine.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.982
Look, I'm... sorry

30:16.015 --> 30:19.518
I've been...
I don't know...

30:19.551 --> 30:22.922
bitchy about
this whole thing.

30:22.955 --> 30:25.491
It's just not
comfortable for me...

30:25.524 --> 30:29.028
lying and having
someone else cover
my mistakes,

30:29.061 --> 30:31.497
and... it just sort of
keeps on compounding,

30:31.530 --> 30:33.499
one on top of the other.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.339
( sighs )

30:40.372 --> 30:42.875
I'm being deployed to Iraq.

30:44.911 --> 30:49.015
I'm heading for Texas
tomorrow morning.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.517
You haven't finished
your residency.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.419
Yeah, I know.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.321
I'm going to finish up the last
few electives down there.

30:55.354 --> 30:59.025
They called you up,
just like that?

31:01.527 --> 31:02.929
Yeah.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.332
You're a coward.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.533
What? What?

31:07.566 --> 31:09.936
A coward and a liar.

31:09.969 --> 31:13.372
I never asked you to do this
for me, but you did,

31:13.405 --> 31:15.942
and now you're leaving,
and I'm supposed to live

31:15.942 --> 31:17.476
with the fact
that I killed a man

31:17.509 --> 31:20.412
and that you helped to lie
for me to cover it up?

31:20.446 --> 31:22.014
Listen, Neela...
Go, Michael.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.582
Go to bloody Iraq...

31:23.615 --> 31:26.085
and tell yourself
you've done something noble.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.955
I had to protect you
and Dr. Carter.

31:28.955 --> 31:32.959
No... you didn't.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.536
Well, at least
the contractions stopped.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.605
So the subq terb worked?

31:46.638 --> 31:50.076
Uh, she's still one centimeter
dilated and 50 percent effaced.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.111
You can sit up now.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.081
So, I should just,
uh... take it easy,

31:55.114 --> 31:56.983
cut back on
a few shifts?

31:56.983 --> 31:59.618
You were having
regular contractions.

31:59.651 --> 32:03.055
Your cervix has softened,
shortened and dilated.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.257
Bed rest, huh,
plain and simple.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.993
For how long?

32:06.993 --> 32:09.228
35-weekers do well,
full terms do better.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.163
Mm-hmm.

32:11.197 --> 32:14.700
No way. I can't stay in bed
for five weeks.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.635
You can and you will.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.604
Schedule an appointment
for an N.S.T.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.407
with my office in a week.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.012
( sighs ):
This blows.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.582
The whole day blows.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.585
Yeah...

32:33.619 --> 32:34.753
What else happened?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.123
Nothing.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.624
Oh, I failed my boards.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.159
What?

32:40.192 --> 32:43.295
Need a 182 to pass,
I got a 167.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.331
Oh, Abby.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.699
Oh...
I'm sorry.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.301
It's okay.

32:49.335 --> 32:50.469
Well, how were you
supposed to study?

32:50.502 --> 32:51.637
You were pulling
double shifts.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.205
It's fine.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.207
It's not like
a burning building

32:55.241 --> 32:56.742
collapsed
on me or anything.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.577
I'll just take
them again.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.579
ANSPAUGH:
Ah, atrium's oozing.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.648
Another 2-O, I can oversew
the purse-string.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.050
V-fib.

33:04.083 --> 33:07.386
ANSPAUGH:
Charge to 30.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.255
I love you so much.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.059
Come on.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.728
Clear.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.098
Clear.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.766
No change.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.235
CORDAY:
Okay, teflon
pledgets.

33:23.269 --> 33:24.736
ANSPAUGH:
Oh, God.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.672
There's blood pouring
out of her ET tube.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.307
D.I.C.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.441
CORDAY:
More platelets
and FFP.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.110
Clear.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.712
Asystole.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.215
Resume cardiac
massage.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.416
ANSPAUGH:
Elizabeth...

33:37.449 --> 33:38.650
CORDAY:
Mig of atropine.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.552
You can stop.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.654
She's gone.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.546
Kerry...

34:07.579 --> 34:10.581
Can you take it out?

34:10.616 --> 34:12.551
By law, we're not
supposed to...

34:12.583 --> 34:13.784
Please.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.722
Of course.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.760
I'm so sorry.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.232
We wanted more.

35:00.266 --> 35:05.171
I had to twist her arm
to have a baby, but...

35:05.171 --> 35:08.507
once Henry was here,
she said, "I can do this.

35:08.540 --> 35:12.611
Eight more
and we got a team."

35:12.644 --> 35:17.249
Sandy had a big family.

35:17.283 --> 35:20.652
I only had her.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.855
And Henry.

35:23.889 --> 35:28.427
What am I supposed to do now?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.435
Would you like me
to talk to the family?

35:36.468 --> 35:38.804
No...

35:38.837 --> 35:41.540
No, I'll go do it.

36:01.327 --> 36:04.496
Hey, you hiding out
or taking inventory?

36:04.530 --> 36:05.964
Oh, just looking
for Reglan.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.666
You leaving?

36:07.699 --> 36:09.235
I've been ordered

36:09.268 --> 36:11.337
to sit on my sofa
for five weeks.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.704
Sounds good to me.

36:12.738 --> 36:16.242
Yeah, I bet.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.710
Do people know?

36:18.744 --> 36:20.746
No, not really.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.981
You prefer it
that way?

36:23.014 --> 36:25.351
You know...

36:25.384 --> 36:27.286
Look, what you did
was stupid,

36:27.319 --> 36:29.421
but there were a lot
of circumstances

36:29.455 --> 36:31.923
that conspired to kill
Luis Sanchez.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.992
The nursing home should've
put a medic alert bracelet

36:34.025 --> 36:35.461
on him but they didn't.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.562
You should've gotten
a full med list,

36:36.595 --> 36:37.996
but you didn't.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.598
If it goes to court,

36:39.631 --> 36:41.600
the Army'll send me
back to testify.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.335
Nah, I doubt
it'll happen.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.271
The bottom line is,

36:45.271 --> 36:47.273
people don't sue
doctors they like,

36:47.273 --> 36:49.941
and for whatever reason,
Mrs. Sanchez liked you.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.449
Take care of yourself
over there, okay?

36:57.483 --> 36:59.285
Yeah.

36:59.285 --> 37:02.654
You have a healthy,
happy baby, Dr. Lewis.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.049
KOVAC:
Hey.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.485
You get called in early?

37:33.519 --> 37:36.054
No, my shift doesn't
start for an hour.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.324
I wanted to see you.

37:38.357 --> 37:40.792
Maybe we can get
a coffee or something.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.734
Sandy Lopez died today.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.602
Who?

37:50.636 --> 37:52.838
Weaver's Sandy.

37:54.540 --> 37:57.843
GALLANT:
Take care, of yourself,
Dr. Kovac. Sam.

38:00.446 --> 38:02.414
So how long
have you got?

38:02.448 --> 38:04.082
Here?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.084
About an hour.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.053
On your tour of duty.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.090
Year at least.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.525
Maybe longer.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.627
So you were just
going to sneak out

38:15.661 --> 38:17.062
under cover
of darkness?

38:17.095 --> 38:19.631
No hi, bye,
kiss my ass, nothing?

38:19.665 --> 38:21.700
You know, I'm not
much for send-offs.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.435
I don't care
what you call it.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.003
There's a war
going on.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.711
Going to miss having
you around, man.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.780
Yeah, right.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.114
No, I'm serious.

38:36.147 --> 38:39.385
You're an honorable guy.

38:39.385 --> 38:42.087
I'm not sure
I've ever met one.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.396
Don't go getting
yourself killed.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.149
( loud music plays )

39:11.182 --> 39:14.520
Alex? Alex?

39:14.553 --> 39:16.455
( sighs )

39:16.488 --> 39:18.524
Alex, get out here.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.595
Mom, guess what?

39:23.629 --> 39:25.163
Alex, turn it down, okay?

39:25.196 --> 39:27.833
I had a crappy day
and I got a major headache.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.001
You look good, though.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.805
Dad's here.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.603
Is there anything
I can do?

40:04.636 --> 40:07.439
You need me
to watch Henry,

40:07.473 --> 40:08.907
or do you need
a ride home?

40:08.940 --> 40:11.810
He's with Sandy's family.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.583
Dr. Weaver...

40:21.186 --> 40:22.954
It's okay.

40:22.988 --> 40:26.958
( sobbing )

40:26.992 --> 40:28.894
Dr. Weaver,
it's okay.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.134
It's okay.

40:36.167 --> 40:40.839
( sobbing continues )

40:48.847 --> 40:51.216
Shh, it's okay.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.557
Got anything else?

40:58.590 --> 40:59.791
No, that's
about it.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.628
NEELA:
You'll need this.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.664
Rabbit's foot.

41:05.697 --> 41:08.834
It's American
for good luck, isn't it?

41:13.304 --> 41:14.873
Thanks.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.779
You're welcome.

41:28.620 --> 41:29.788
You'd better
come back,

41:29.821 --> 41:31.557
you know that,
don't you?

41:34.192 --> 41:35.661
Yeah, I will.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.666
You just better be
a damn good doctor

41:40.699 --> 41:42.701
when I do.

41:51.076 --> 41:53.579
You ready?

41:55.346 --> 41:57.282
Bye, Michael.

42:46.197 --> 42:49.735
( doorbell chimes )

42:51.036 --> 42:52.671
Hi, Eduardo.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.372
I'm here to get Henry.
Is he awake?

42:54.405 --> 42:56.041
Listen, he's not here.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.809
I think he's with
my aunt or something.

42:57.843 --> 42:58.910
No, no, you...

42:58.944 --> 43:01.246
You told me that
Theresa...

43:01.279 --> 43:02.881
Look, it's nothing
personal, okay?

43:02.914 --> 43:04.382
I mean, I always
really liked you.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.151
Wait a minute.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.654
You said that Theresa
was taking care of him.

43:08.687 --> 43:10.155
We're his blood relatives.

43:10.188 --> 43:11.757
What are you
talking about?

43:11.790 --> 43:13.191
What's...
going on here?

43:13.224 --> 43:14.259
Where's Henry?

43:14.292 --> 43:15.761
I don't know.

43:15.794 --> 43:18.029
Where is my son?

43:18.063 --> 43:19.798
Sandy's son.

43:19.831 --> 43:23.769
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

43:23.802 --> 43:26.137
What... I don't understand
what you're talking about.

43:26.171 --> 43:27.706
Where is he?

43:29.675 --> 43:30.676
I hear him.
Let me in.

43:30.709 --> 43:31.810
No, no,
that's mine.

43:31.843 --> 43:34.880
( talking at once )

43:34.913 --> 43:37.683
No, Kerry,
he's not here.

43:37.683 --> 43:38.917
I know my own
son's voice!

43:38.950 --> 43:40.018
Let me inside.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.186
I'm really sorry.

43:41.219 --> 43:42.220
Please!
Please!

43:42.253 --> 43:43.254
No.

43:43.288 --> 43:45.056
Why are you doing this?

43:45.090 --> 43:47.058
Give me my boy.

43:49.695 --> 43:51.429
Why are you doing this?
Let me in.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.164
Damn it, let me in!

43:53.198 --> 43:54.332
Give me my son.

43:54.365 --> 43:56.134
Give me back my son.
