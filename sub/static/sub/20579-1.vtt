(sighs)

04:02.993 --> 04:04.666
Come on, Sandy.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.168
I promised Lang these pictures tomorrow.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.251
We'll be here all night
trying to get this thing finished.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.880
(Sandy) Keep your shirt on, buster.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.930
I'll keep my shirt on. You just take yours off.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.803
(Sandy) I've got to get the lines
out of my body.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.720
Ha! Don't worry, baby.
I'll get the lines out for ya.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.013
<i>- (Laughs)
- Comm'.</i>

04:27.684 --> 04:29.903
Do I have to pose with that ape again?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.525
Well, it's what Lang wants.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.154
Well, he knows he's gonna
have to pay me more for this job.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.362
- He knows.
- Well, I still don't like it.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.570
He knows that, too.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.791
(Laughs)

04:49.039 --> 04:51.007
She knows I mean it, huh, Harmon?

04:57.964 --> 05:00.888
Hey, them were some pretty good pictures
you made that day.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.890
Well, the best sellers we ever had.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.230
Sandra got a 100-buck bonus.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.899
Just remember you got one coming.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.732
One of these days,
I'm gonna spill the beans on this little deal.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.109
What beans?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.862
Pictures of you from every angle?

05:15.899 --> 05:19.574
Or maybe the pictures of Ajax here
whaling the tar out of you.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.034
I'll even give you some prints.
You can use them for evidence.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.449
You no good, rotten...

05:24.533 --> 05:26.251
Shut up, you!

05:26.326 --> 05:28.249
Come on, come on, let's get going.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.750
- Want me to help?
- No!

05:29.788 --> 05:32.086
- (Laughs)
- No, I can do it myself.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.462
OK, Ajax, come on. Help me move
that stuff back over there, will ya?

05:37.546 --> 05:39.219
And look out for the booze.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.687
(Harmon) OK, now, Sandy. Sit down.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.861
Let's make this nice and easy.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.440
Drape it over here.

05:57.107 --> 06:00.327
Bring it across the back.
I want you to bring your arms up.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.742
OK.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.827
OK, now, Sandy. Let's start off with, uh,

06:07.909 --> 06:10.958
you know, nice and easy,
with an art pose or two.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.041
Give me the hands behind your head.
That's right. Give me the hands behind.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.298
Straighten up your back, honey.
Pull your shoulders back.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.178
That's a girl. Come on, now.
Give me a nice smile.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.473
Come on, come on. That's it. Now hold it.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.842
(Camera clicks)

06:23.466 --> 06:25.560
Now, let's have, urn...

06:27.137 --> 06:29.606
Oh, how about "hands at the glory of sun" bit.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.984
Put your hands up.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.820
Up.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.820
Ajax, tilt that light up a little bit, will ya?

06:38.857 --> 06:40.609
Yeah, that's perfect.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.820
OK... Come on, Sandy.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.364
(Harmon) Let's cooperate a little, huh?

06:45.447 --> 06:48.496
Now you're really a beautiful girl,
so let's look that way.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.160
Come on, stretch a little.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.337
That's it. That's it.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.840
Harmon, you're really a great photographer.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.502
Why don't you give this up
and try and do something decent?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.384
Why don't you?

07:02.464 --> 07:04.466
(Sandy clears throat) You know why.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.431
I'm in this up to my...eyeballs.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.523
Yup. Me too, Sandy.

07:12.974 --> 07:16.774
You know, uh, I'm sorry what I said before.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.482
You know I like you, but...

07:21.191 --> 07:22.534
Oh, what the hell.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.319
Come on! Let's move!

07:25.236 --> 07:28.615
- Or I call Mr. Lang, huh?
- Drop dead, you creep.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.828
OK, Sandy. Come on.
Let's shoot something interesting.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.163
(Harmon) You know, the stuff that sells?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.377
More of those?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.751
Oh, for...

07:41.670 --> 07:42.967
All right. (signs)

07:43.046 --> 07:45.799
But remember, I'm not double-jointed.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.471
Yeah, but the...

07:47.550 --> 07:50.554
The high school kids who buy these pictures
think you are.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.063
Let's try anyway-

07:52.097 --> 07:54.725
Tell you what, why don't you try
a different angle?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.693
Yeah, that's a good angle.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.105
But I wanna see it from the other side.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.237
Ah, that's, uh...
that...that's beautiful.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.571
Now hold it.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.781
(Harmon) OK. Just one more. Anybody got any ideas?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.325
Say, now that's an idea.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.836
(Laughs) Wow!

08:14.911 --> 08:16.754
Wait till Lang sees this one.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.172
Keep that ape away from me!

08:22.877 --> 08:25.096
Harmon? Harmon!

08:25.171 --> 08:28.971
Oh, come on, Sandy. Just a cuddle.
You said you'd do it. Let's get it over with.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.594
No, not with him! He...

08:30.677 --> 08:33.520
(Ajax) He what that you don't know
plenty about already?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.769
- (Sandy) No! No!
- (Ajax laughs)

08:37.308 --> 08:38.650
(Sandy) Stop it. you gorilla!

08:38.727 --> 08:40.900
(Ajax) Ah, shut up. You know you love me.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.530
<i>'</i> (Sandy screaming)
- (Ajax laughs)

08:42.605 --> 08:44.983
- (Sandy) Stop it!
- (Ajax laughs)

08:45.066 --> 08:46.989
- (Sandy screams)
- (Ajax laughs)

08:47.068 --> 08:48.615
(Sandy grunting)

08:52.449 --> 08:54.167
(Sandy struggling)

08:55.869 --> 08:57.291
(Ajax laughs)

08:58.747 --> 08:59.964
(Sandy) Stop it!

09:00.832 --> 09:02.379
(Ajax laughs)

09:02.959 --> 09:05.678
Stop it! Stop it!

09:05.754 --> 09:07.677
Harmon! Stop him!

09:07.756 --> 09:09.554
Can't you see what he's doing?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.302
(I Dramatic music)

09:13.136 --> 09:14.388
I can see.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.567
All right, Harmon. Let's go to work.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.410
Print up 100 of this one.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.660
And this one.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.328
And this one.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.963
And get rid of the rest of 'em.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.077
What's the matter, Sandra?
You got a problem?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.750
Yes, the usual one.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.420
You've certainly seen enough of me by now.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.214
I'm about due for retirement.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.541
Well, let's see.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.226
Sandra, my clear, your, uh...

10:35.260 --> 10:39.265
your modeling has been fairly successful.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.898
Our payroll record shows that
including what you've received today,

10:43.977 --> 10:46.196
you have an income,

10:46.229 --> 10:50.860
and please, report it
to the Internal Revenue Department,

10:50.900 --> 10:53.403
of nearly $9,000 this year.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.367
Well, you ask Larry.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.750
He says my pictures are getting hard to sell.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.251
Yes, my dear.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.294
I tend to agree with that.

11:02.370 --> 11:06.591
Uh, I think Sandra is right, Mr. Lang.
We ought to let her get out.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.877
Well, well!

11:08.918 --> 11:14.015
I didn't know we had
a personal interest in this.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.808
Sandra, my dear,

11:15.884 --> 11:19.013
we've, uh, talked about this
many times before,

11:19.095 --> 11:22.474
and, uh, this time,
I think you've made your point.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.434
You mean I can get out?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.771
(Mr. Lang) Uh, as a model, yes.

11:27.854 --> 11:31.279
But you wouldn't wanna give up
all of this nice money, would you?

11:32.483 --> 11:36.784
Harmon, say hello
to our new recruiting agent.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.953
Yes, Sandra, my dear.

11:39.991 --> 11:44.622
Your new job will be to find us
new, fresh talent.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.289
Ajax will help you.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.800
Ajax has an eye for beauty.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.463
An eye isn't all he has. I want out.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.718
Let me finish, please.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.721
You'll be paid well for your new work.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.350
Our salesmen have been promised
a continuous flow of product.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.353
So, if you're unable
to find us new, fresh talent,

12:04.432 --> 12:07.026
you'll have to do the modeling yourself.

12:07.101 --> 12:10.025
During the recruitment period,

12:10.104 --> 12:11.981
it might prove helpful

12:12.065 --> 12:14.488
if you pose with the new girl.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.495
Sort of get her over her initial embarrassment.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.160
But understand this.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.168
If you don't secure us the new, fresh talent,

12:24.244 --> 12:28.374
we're going to have to have
a broader variety of poses

12:28.456 --> 12:30.584
if you're to do the modeling yourself.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.837
(I Orchestral music)

12:56.693 --> 12:59.287
I'll bring her up,
but you're gonna have to sell her.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.286
I can't do any more. She's a sweet kid.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.958
Yeah, yeah. She may be,

13:04.033 --> 13:08.880
but, uh, Ajax told Lang, and Lang told me,
and I'm telling you.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.879
This is the girl we want.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.760
Now I just do my job, you do yours.

13:14.877 --> 13:19.383
And remember this,
this is one way to keep Ajax away from you.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.202
Kim, this is Harmon.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.041
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.750
Yeah, she's a young beauty, all right.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.669
Harmon, Kim hasn't done
very much modeling before.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.299
I told her it didn't matter.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.255
No, no. That doesn't matter.

13:59.339 --> 14:04.015
We're just looking for a fresh, uh...
a fresh face.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.097
Well, I don't really know what this is all about.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.357
What kind of modeling is this?

14:09.432 --> 14:13.062
Well, you folks probably wanna talk
about this privately.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.821
- Kim, I'll wait in your house for you, all right?
- OK.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.862
(Harmon clicks tongue)

14:18.941 --> 14:20.909
(sighs)

14:20.943 --> 14:22.240
Well?

14:22.278 --> 14:23.996
Is there anything else?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.042
(Harmon) Mmm-hmm.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.119
You'll do just fine.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.631
Mr. Harmon,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.380
I really don't think I can do this.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.508
Oh, no. Now you let me decide that, huh?

14:39.587 --> 14:42.761
Uh, come around here. Let me see your legs.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.846
MY legs?

14:44.217 --> 14:47.141
You know, your legs, gams, stems.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.931
Your lower extremities? Legs.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.895
Nothing to be ashamed of.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.897
Even some of my best friends have legs.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.945
Look, I don't know if this is right.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.904
What's this all about?

15:01.275 --> 15:04.279
OK, OK. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.540
Look, here's the deal. I have this job to shoot.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.503
It's a glamour photograph of shoes
and legs are important.

15:12.328 --> 15:18.335
Now, this job should take, 0h,
about an hour, and it pays $50 in cash.

15:18.376 --> 15:22.847
Now may I please see
whether you have legs or two fence posts

15:22.922 --> 15:25.095
so I can tell whether
I even need you for the job?

15:25.675 --> 15:28.428
- $50?
- In cash.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.871
(Harmon) OK...

15:48.865 --> 15:50.538
Let's make pictures.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.045
OK, now, Kim, hold it.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.715
That's it. Don't smile. OK.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.087
(Camera clicks)

15:59.167 --> 16:00.885
That's it, Kim.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.464
OK, now. Let's have, uh...
let's see. Just one more.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.517
How about the leg up on the chair there?

16:07.550 --> 16:08.597
Put it up.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.678
- Like this?
- (Harmon) Yeah, that's right.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.643
Point your toes.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.769
OK.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.397
- Now hold it.
- (Camera clicks)

16:16.476 --> 16:17.819
That's the girl.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.734
Well, that's it for the night.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.530
You know, Kim?

16:24.567 --> 16:26.069
You're a very pretty girl.

16:27.236 --> 16:32.538
And for being so nice and a good girl,
here's your lollipop.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.499
You mean that's all there is? I'm through?

16:35.578 --> 16:37.171
That's all there is to it.

16:37.246 --> 16:41.251
- Unless maybe, uh...
- Unless what?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.090
Well, uh...

16:43.127 --> 16:44.629
Unless...

16:44.712 --> 16:46.965
No, no. You wouldn't...
wouldn't be interested in that.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.766
Sure I'm interested.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.891
I love working with you, Harmon.
You're so creative.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.852
And, gee, I do need the money.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.274
Yeah, that's what Sandra said.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.648
College or something like that, isn't it?

17:02.146 --> 17:04.865
Well, I'll tell ya about the shot.

17:04.941 --> 17:09.367
I, uh... I don't know if you'd be interested in it,
but it'll pay another $50.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.532
Of course I'm interested. Tell me.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.117
Well, it's, uh, just bathing suit stuff.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.165
Oh...

17:17.244 --> 17:19.292
On the beach? What?

17:19.704 --> 17:23.550
Uh, yeah. On the beach, uh...

17:23.626 --> 17:25.549
You know, in a studio...

17:27.046 --> 17:29.845
You know, glamour... glamour shots.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.426
It's, uh...

17:31.467 --> 17:34.311
It's for a guy who wants to make a, uh,

17:34.387 --> 17:36.139
a glamour calendar, that's all.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.141
I just don't know.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.444
My father wouldn't like it.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.356
Yeah, well, that's OK. Forget it.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.031
You know, there's plenty of girls around.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.735
It's not like you're leaving me
in a hole or anything.

17:49.986 --> 17:50.987
I'll do it.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.373
OK.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.458
Saturday, 10 o'clock.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.455
(I Soft orchestral music)

19:32.630 --> 19:35.133
Another $50?

19:35.257 --> 19:37.601
I'm sure proud of you, Kim.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.100
You're really salting it away.

19:40.179 --> 19:45.777
But what I can't understand is why they pay
you so much for merely modeling dresses.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.904
Oh, well, it's my size.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.941
There aren't many girls around
that wear this size.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.031
None that pretty, you can bet.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.703
Who's this fella Harmon?

19:55.778 --> 19:58.122
The photographer
you're always talking about?

19:58.781 --> 20:01.125
He's an absolute doll!

20:01.200 --> 20:05.626
It's hardly work at all
and he's a wonderful photographer.

20:06.080 --> 20:10.756
Maybe he is, but I'll never know.
I've never even heard of him.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.297
And where are these pictures
you promised me?

20:15.172 --> 20:19.803
Oh, Dad. I can't ask Harmon
to make prints specially for me.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.680
I said I'd pay for them.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.482
Are you sure you asked him at all?

20:25.558 --> 20:29.483
Have you told him about
the other man in your life? Me.

20:29.812 --> 20:33.487
Oh, Daddy, it's not that way at all.

20:34.358 --> 20:40.411
Well, at this rate, you'll have enough money
to go to college this fall.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.538
By the way, what is your next modeling job?

20:44.493 --> 20:46.040
I don't know.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.374
That money is for the job I did last week.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.171
And he hasn't called me lately.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.174
Are you sure he's satisfied with your work?

20:54.211 --> 20:56.964
Oh, I'm sure he is. It's just that...

20:57.006 --> 21:00.806
He isn't asking you to do anything
I wouldn't approve of, is he?

21:00.843 --> 21:04.598
(Gasps) Oh, no! Nothing like that!

21:04.680 --> 21:06.933
Don't you think I ought to meet
this fellow Harmon?

21:07.183 --> 21:11.359
Daddy, it's just a professional relationship.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.691
I guess I'm glad to hear that.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.155
I'm sure he'll call me again.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.241
I hope he does, Kim.

21:19.320 --> 21:24.201
If you're accepted at Craxton,
we will have to have the tuition money ready.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.086
Of course, you can always wait a year.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.913
A year?

21:28.996 --> 21:31.340
Let's not worry.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.717
He'll probably call.

21:33.751 --> 21:39.508
I wish I had enough money
so never to have to worry at all.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.768
You've always taken pretty good care of me.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.971
And you know I love you.

21:45.054 --> 21:48.058
Besides, you're the best father I've ever had.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.232
(Laughs)

21:56.774 --> 21:58.902
(sighs) Mr. Lang,

22:00.069 --> 22:04.666
we're gonna lose all our distributors
unless we get some new pictures.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.289
We just haven't got a thing to sell.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.041
The boy is right, Harmon.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.503
We've poured a lot of money
into this new girl. What's happening?

22:12.623 --> 22:15.672
Well, I haven't called her in a week.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.845
Guess we'll just have to outwait her.

22:17.920 --> 22:22.016
And then, when she gets edgy,
we'll just pull her into the net.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.725
- Poor kid.
- (Scoffs) Look, Harmon,

22:26.762 --> 22:30.062
I think you're on the wrong track
with this Kim anyway.

22:30.099 --> 22:35.276
Do you know that she's known all over school
as the biggest prude since Queen Victoria?

22:35.354 --> 22:39.109
(Lang) Larry, you stick
to the distribution end of the business.

22:39.608 --> 22:43.283
<i>"Cosi fan tutte as Mozart said.</i>

22:43.362 --> 22:44.579
What does that mean?

22:44.613 --> 22:48.584
- It means women are all alike.
- (Scoffs)

22:48.617 --> 22:51.996
Not this babe. (Scoffs) Take it from me.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.249
I tried that one myself.

22:54.290 --> 22:58.136
And, uh, if I couldn't make it with her,
then nobody can.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.553
(Harmon groans)

22:59.628 --> 23:03.678
Look, boys, our business is pleasure.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.680
Let's do it in front of the camera.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.979
(Scoffs) Well, I'm willing if she is.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.108
Harmon, I'll bet you a week's take

23:12.141 --> 23:15.315
that you couldn't take a picture
of the two of us that you can sell.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.399
Oh, Larry...

23:16.478 --> 23:19.573
It's OK. It's OK.
None of us are gentlemen anyway.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.117
- (Scoffs)
- Get out your money, big mouth.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.572
(I Dramatic music)

24:13.619 --> 24:17.214
Gee, uh, I'm sorry, Kim, but I just, uh,

24:17.289 --> 24:19.883
don't have any assignments
that fit you right now.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.179
Yeah, yeah. I know you need the work, but...

24:25.422 --> 24:29.222
Oh, now, come on, Kim.
Certainly you're a good model.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.261
Uh-huh.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.722
What?

24:32.805 --> 24:34.398
Oh, uh...

24:34.473 --> 24:38.023
Yes. Yes. I'm shooting some pictures.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.946
But I don't think you'd wanna pose for these.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.408
Look, Kim, I'll tell you what.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.911
Why don't you come down here,
we'll talk about it.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.866
Ooh, no, no, no. Not now, not now.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.119
Make it about 5 o'clock, OK?

24:55.244 --> 24:56.621
Good bye.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.968
Hey, while you're fiddling, Rome is burning.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.674
Your stick's getting cold.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.601
(Harmon) Don't worry. I'll put some more fire under it.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.435
Besides, it's well done anyway.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.646
Hello, loud mouth?

25:19.476 --> 25:22.776
Listen, pole vault down here about 5:30, huh?

25:22.813 --> 25:25.487
Yeah, yeah. Back door.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.319
Yeah, the old cloak and dagger stuff.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.196
OK.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.576
All right.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.709
More contributions
to the delinquency of a minor?

25:36.785 --> 25:42.337
Well, now, if she's, uh, anything like you,
contributions will be gladly accepted.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.217
I could never do that.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.799
Well, I told you you wouldn't do it.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.805
Haven't you anything else?

25:51.884 --> 25:57.106
Look, sweetie, this job will keep me
and whoever does the job tied up for weeks.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.982
It's a tremendous job.

25:59.058 --> 26:02.938
But why does your client
have to see me like that?

26:02.978 --> 26:07.859
I told you. This company,
uh, they make under things.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.909
And they wanna take a look at you.

26:09.985 --> 26:13.114
First, I got them to settle
forjust a photograph of ya,

26:13.155 --> 26:17.205
instead of a personal inspection.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.379
And then I got them to settle
for just the upper half.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.664
What if I pose in my bra?

26:22.748 --> 26:25.672
Look, you want me to lose the deal?

26:25.709 --> 26:28.383
Hey, I shouldn't even
be discussing this with you.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.591
Look, Kim.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.050
Do you trust me?

26:34.384 --> 26:36.557
I guess so.

26:36.637 --> 26:41.518
Did I tell you that this job
pays $500 for two weeks' work?

26:42.142 --> 26:45.567
- $500?
- Mmm-hmm.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.901
Well, I hate to have you pass up that money.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.908
Say, I tell you what.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.077
You pose for me

26:56.156 --> 26:59.035
and I'll take some shots of you
and then I'll show you the shots.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.541
If you don't like 'em, we won't submit 'em.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.873
Tear 'em up and forget the whole thing.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.333
Sound fair enough?

27:07.501 --> 27:08.878
(sighs)

27:08.919 --> 27:13.641
Look, kid, yes or no. You don't like the deal,
you can get up and leave.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.717
There's plenty of models around.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.020
I can't sit here all afternoon, you know?

27:24.935 --> 27:26.403
Where can I...

27:27.729 --> 27:29.197
Back in there.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.197
Just the upper half, you said.

27:36.238 --> 27:41.244
Oh, come on. What is this, a nursery school?
Yeah, yeah, sure. Just the upper half.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.044
(sighs)

27:58.468 --> 28:00.470
(I Soft orchestral music)

28:26.205 --> 28:28.128
(Harmon) Get up here, Kim,
would you please?

28:33.837 --> 28:35.760
Oh, come on, come on!

28:35.797 --> 28:38.141
I've done enough bathing suit shots of you

28:38.217 --> 28:40.595
to know that you won't be embarrassed
to give me that dress.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.816
Yeah.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.152
Give me the rarest thing every time.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.281
Now, as soon as I fix this light,
we'll get started.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.507
(Harmon) OK.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.510
Drop.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.015
Get some focus here.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.353
Move a bit to the left.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.310
OK, now let's make one.

29:25.347 --> 29:28.317
Uh, put your hair over your left shoulder.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.561
And give me the hands behind the neck.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.570
That's it. Now look
just to the right of that light there.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.243
Now, put your right shoulder back a little bit.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.537
Straighten up now.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.120
Come on. Come on, Kim, smile.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.623
That's it. OK, hold it.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.123
(Camera clicks)

29:53.875 --> 29:57.379
OK, Kim. Now that was fine.
Now turn to your right.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.348
That's the girl.

30:00.382 --> 30:03.477
OK, now for this shot, tell you what you do.

30:03.552 --> 30:06.772
Put your, uh...
put your hair back in your back then.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.146
Where it was before. That's the girl.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.647
OK, now put your arms upstretched.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.817
Arms upstretched. Come on, way upstretched.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.490
Come on, Kim.

30:17.566 --> 30:21.070
Pull your tummy in,
put your arms out further stretched.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.747
Like you're diving. Come on, come on.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.871
- Now smile. Hold it. There, that's good.
- (Camera clicks)

30:28.076 --> 30:32.582
Uh, I'll tell you what, Kim,
uh, let's do that again, huh?

30:32.622 --> 30:35.842
Uh, put your hair over your shoulder.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.009
Your left shoulder there.

30:37.085 --> 30:40.214
And then, you know, back the way you were,
arms outstretched.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.928
(Footsteps approaching)

30:42.424 --> 30:43.596
(Kim) Who's that walking?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.727
(Harmon) Uh, it's just me, uh, walking around.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.890
OK, now arms outstretched. That's it.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.105
- OK.
- (Larry) Hey, look this way.

30:52.142 --> 30:53.439
- (Camera clicks)
- (Gasps and screams)

30:53.477 --> 30:54.649
(Laughs)

30:55.354 --> 30:56.776
Thanks a lot!

30:57.022 --> 30:58.490
(Laughs)

30:58.565 --> 31:00.784
(Larry) Now that'll look good in my scrapbook.

31:01.610 --> 31:02.782
(Laughs)

31:02.861 --> 31:04.534
(Clears throat)

31:05.447 --> 31:06.869
Hey, Kim.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.622
When you're through with your hysterics,

31:10.410 --> 31:12.162
get dressed and get out here.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.457
We've got business to discuss.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.466
(Laughs)

31:18.960 --> 31:22.339
That'll be one bet that'll be a pleasure to lose.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.639
(Laughs)

31:24.966 --> 31:26.684
(Harmon) You know something?

31:26.802 --> 31:28.099
(sighs)

31:28.470 --> 31:32.520
There's only one other person in this world
more disgusting than you.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.894
(Larry) Who? Ajax?

31:37.145 --> 31:39.364
Mmm-mmm. Me.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.789
(I Orchestral music)

32:02.337 --> 32:03.964
(Sobbing)

32:04.005 --> 32:06.474
Kim! Kim, what's the matter?

32:06.508 --> 32:09.102
Oh, that awful boy, that Larry.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.350
He told me I'd have to pose.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.685
Pose without any clothes
or he'd show the pictures to my father.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.773
Oh, that little snake.

32:17.853 --> 32:21.483
Sandra, what'll I do? What'll I do?

32:21.523 --> 32:25.198
Well, first of all, honey, don't get hysterical.
It's not gonna help you.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.154
(Sobs) I'm better now.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.282
Sandra, what can I do?

32:30.365 --> 32:33.039
I can't let them show those pictures.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.712
What do they want them for?

32:35.787 --> 32:39.337
Why would Harmon do that?
I thought he liked me.

32:39.833 --> 32:43.053
You want my advice? Well, here it is.

32:43.086 --> 32:46.431
You're not going to like it, honey,
but hear me out, please?

32:46.506 --> 32:48.304
If you don't go along with these morons,

32:48.383 --> 32:51.728
they're gonna place your bosom
all over this town.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.274
Honey, my suggestion is this. Pose for them.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.068
(Sobbing)

33:04.024 --> 33:07.119
But... but I can't.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.413
Why would they do such a thing?

33:09.738 --> 33:13.083
Do you want them to show those pictures
all over town?

33:13.158 --> 33:15.502
Kim, you gotta do it.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.122
They probably won't even use film.

33:18.205 --> 33:20.754
All they want to do is take a good look.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.258
(Sobbing)

33:22.334 --> 33:26.089
That won't help, Kim.
You have to make up your mind.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.423
Snap out of it, honey.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.593
Haven't you ever
been looked at by a man before?

33:30.675 --> 33:34.270
You mean without... Of course not.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.398
I don't know what to do.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.809
(Sobs) You really think if I...

33:38.892 --> 33:42.271
It's the only way. I know these kids, honey.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.449
They send snapshots to your father
just to be mean.

33:46.274 --> 33:50.450
All you do is turn your head away
when they snap the picture. That's all.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.281
(crying)

33:55.450 --> 33:57.498
I guess you're right.

33:57.577 --> 34:01.377
It's my own fault for posing for Harmon
in the first place.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.964
I'll have to go through with it.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.637
But then I'm through with Harmon for good.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.599
Even if I can't go to college this fall.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.389
(I Dramatic music)

34:54.884 --> 34:56.181
She's hooked.

35:09.399 --> 35:12.744
(Ajax) Come on! Let's go! Off with the clothes.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.914
Come on, Ajax.
Quit acting like the ape you are, will ya?

35:18.116 --> 35:21.916
Look, Kim, I'm truly sorry about this. I gotta...

35:21.995 --> 35:25.545
He's right. We're not here to serve tea.

35:25.582 --> 35:26.959
You know the terms.

35:27.042 --> 35:30.342
No face shots and Ajax leaves the room.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.723
Look, little Miss Bright Eyes,

35:33.798 --> 35:37.018
you're in no position to dictate terms.

35:37.052 --> 35:41.808
You know, uh, you're pretty anxious
to show off your body to Harmon, yeah?

35:41.890 --> 35:43.938
Now it's our turn.

35:44.017 --> 35:46.111
If I wanna sell tickets, I'll do it.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.359
Yeah, and another thing, too.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.441
Ajax stays, see.

35:52.734 --> 35:54.657
You're just lucky there aren't a dozen of us.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.738
(Ajax and Larry laugh)

35:56.780 --> 36:00.284
And, uh, have you ever seen Ajax in action?

36:00.408 --> 36:01.580
(Laughing)

36:02.619 --> 36:04.496
He's like a mad bull.

36:04.579 --> 36:06.502
Now you give me a hard time
and I'll just correct...

36:06.581 --> 36:08.083
Listen, punk, one more word out of you

36:08.124 --> 36:10.422
- and I'll pick you up off the floor with a mop.
- (Sighs)

36:10.460 --> 36:13.339
Now, this conversation
was no part of the deal.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.766
Now, Ajax can stay,
but no more of this nonsense.

36:16.841 --> 36:20.436
(Scoffs) Ah, who wants her anyway?

36:20.470 --> 36:22.598
You mean I can go?

36:23.640 --> 36:26.484
Uh, no, Kim, I'm afraid not.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.778
Come on, come on.
Let's get started here, uh...

36:28.853 --> 36:32.073
Kim, you, uh, better go in the dressing room
and get ready, huh?

36:35.193 --> 36:36.365
Go ahead, Kim.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.321
(Ajax) Ah, let her undress here.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.662
You better get going.

36:51.292 --> 36:52.589
(Scoffs)

36:54.629 --> 36:56.381
OK, is everything ready?

36:57.882 --> 37:01.182
Say, how did I ever get mixed up
with you two characters anyway?

37:02.303 --> 37:05.477
You're mixed up all right. I'll tell you that.

37:05.515 --> 37:10.112
You try to get unmixed
and you're gonna lose your bankroll.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.694
And about ten years to boot.

37:12.772 --> 37:16.276
You know, you can always make those
license plate mug-shots at Leavenworth.

37:18.570 --> 37:22.575
If I do, punk, you'll be right there with me.

37:22.824 --> 37:26.829
Not me, Daddy-O, now, you forget I'm a minor.

37:27.746 --> 37:31.671
And the worst that can happen
to a juvenile offender is probation.

37:31.708 --> 37:33.927
Mr. Lang said so. (Chuckles)

37:34.002 --> 37:35.629
And I'll tell you the truth. It's, uh...

37:35.670 --> 37:38.514
It's worth it for the dough
that I'm making. (Chuckling)

37:41.176 --> 37:44.271
(Groans) You don't want me
in these shots, huh?

37:44.345 --> 37:46.723
Why, you moron.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.274
You wanna spoil everything?

37:48.349 --> 37:51.444
You know, she can still walk out
until we get these shots.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.897
That stuff we shot the other day
isn't even illegal.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.358
- (Chuckles)
- Yeah, he's right.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.944
Just, uh, just wait a couple of days.

37:59.027 --> 38:03.373
Now, today you can sit in a dark corner
and just, uh, just look,

38:03.448 --> 38:06.952
or, uh, ever else you wanna do, Ajax,

38:07.035 --> 38:09.538
because nobody's gonna be looking at you.

38:09.579 --> 38:13.709
OK, OK. I'll wait till she's ripe.
What's keepin' her now? Jeez.

38:16.920 --> 38:20.015
Come on, slowpoke, shake a leg, huh.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.300
Come on.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.431
Come on, Ajax. Cut that out. Come on.

38:24.511 --> 38:25.854
(Chuckles)

38:27.055 --> 38:30.730
I'm sorry, Kim,
but, uh, you better get out here.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.603
(Kim) I'm about ready.

38:33.686 --> 38:36.530
Could I keep my sweater on until I...

38:37.023 --> 38:40.072
Yes, yes, you can,
uh, leave your sweater on, Kim.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.619
Over here, Kim.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.792
(Larry) OK, OK, off with the sweater.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.966
Pease, give me just a moment.

38:59.045 --> 39:02.424
(Larry) Oh, what is it with this
red carpet treatment?

39:02.465 --> 39:05.389
Who does she thinks she is,
the Queen of Sheba?

39:05.426 --> 39:08.225
I said I'd do it and I'll do it-.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.685
You said you'd give me the prints

39:09.764 --> 39:12.643
and all the negatives from those pictures
we took the other day.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.398
Yes and here they are.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.906
- All the prints?
- All the prints.

39:18.940 --> 39:23.446
But I don't see why you'd want these when
the shots we're gonna take today, they're...

39:23.486 --> 39:25.329
I want them.

39:25.405 --> 39:29.751
Look, Kim, I'll give them to you
if I have your solemn word

39:29.826 --> 39:32.955
that when you get them,
you'll go through with today's poses.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.836
I said I'd do it, Harmon.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.384
Now, Kim, you've got to understand,

39:38.459 --> 39:42.089
if you refuse after I give you these pictures,

39:42.130 --> 39:46.510
I'll have the responsibility
of a smashed studio.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.312
Now, you know Ajax when he gets wound up.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.439
I understand.

39:51.472 --> 39:52.974
You have my word.

40:06.112 --> 40:09.616
(Larry) Come on, what's she doing?
When's the curtain going up?

40:10.700 --> 40:12.077
I'm ready.

40:21.711 --> 40:24.464
(Harmon) Soon as I adjust this light,
we're good to go.

40:32.555 --> 40:35.183
(Larry) on... Like, wow!

40:35.266 --> 40:36.609
(Larry moans)

40:36.684 --> 40:40.985
(Ajax) Wait till I get my hands on that.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.361
(Kim) Are you finished, Harmon?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.943
(Harmon) No, no, I'm still adjusting the lights.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.374
It'll just be, uh, just a few minutes, Kim.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.664
- (Kim) What was that?
- (Harmon) Uh, nothing, nothing, nothing.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.924
- (Kim) You took a picture.
- (Harmon) No, no, honey.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.594
I was just, uh, just testing the lamps.

41:04.337 --> 41:05.554
(Larry) Over here.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.383
You shot my face!

41:09.717 --> 41:11.890
- (Crying)
- (Larry) Get up-

41:11.928 --> 41:13.680
- <i>I</i> said get up!
- (Screaming)

41:14.681 --> 41:17.309
- You get away from her.
- (Sobbing)

41:17.392 --> 41:19.565
(Harmon) Come on, let's get up.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.322
(Harmon) That's enough, come on.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.866
(Ajax) Hey, give me that sweater.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.751
Boy trouble, gorgeous?

41:39.789 --> 41:43.259
No, Daddy. Everything's fine.

41:43.292 --> 41:46.136
You don't look like everything is fine.

41:46.212 --> 41:48.806
I'm just tired, I guess.

41:55.930 --> 41:59.184
Have you heard
from that photographer lately?

41:59.392 --> 42:01.144
Well, I...

42:01.227 --> 42:02.900
No. No, I haven't.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.524
I don't know why, honey,

42:05.606 --> 42:08.780
but I think that photographer
is what is the matter with you.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.407
Why do you think that?

42:11.654 --> 42:13.372
Now, honey.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.450
Have I touched the wrong nerve?

42:15.533 --> 42:18.787
Why doesn't everyone just leave me alone?

42:18.870 --> 42:20.167
(Door slams)

42:26.461 --> 42:27.883
(indistinct conversations)

42:40.183 --> 42:42.436
(Larry) You see this girl who just sat there?

42:42.477 --> 42:43.694
Her name's Kim.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.986
- (indistinct conversations)
- (Men exclaiming)

42:49.192 --> 42:51.069
(Man 1)That's her. Kim.

42:51.152 --> 42:52.870
(Man 2) Oh, my God. Look at this!

42:52.945 --> 42:55.289
(indistinct conversations)

43:16.677 --> 43:19.351
You're Kim, aren't you?

43:19.388 --> 43:24.815
Excuse me. I forgot that you're a lady
who doesn't speak to strangers.

43:24.852 --> 43:25.978
Ain't that right, fellas?

43:26.312 --> 43:31.034
Oh, I don't know if she's a lady but, ha-ha,
I got proof she sure ain't no gentleman.

43:31.067 --> 43:32.364
(All laughing)

43:36.197 --> 43:40.748
I'm a photographer and I need some
special pictures.

43:40.827 --> 43:42.875
I was referred to you.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.582
Larry. You know Larry, don't you?

43:45.665 --> 43:49.090
He said you'd be glad to pose.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.511
(Men chuckling)

43:52.380 --> 43:54.257
- (Ail laughing)
- (indistinct chattering)

44:02.390 --> 44:03.983
(Phone ringing)

44:16.571 --> 44:20.747
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, is this Miss She/wood?</i>

44:20.825 --> 44:23.203
<i>Miss Sherwood, are you there?</i>

44:23.244 --> 44:24.245
Yes.

44:24.328 --> 44:27.127
<i>Miss Sherwood, my name is Lang.</i>

44:27.915 --> 44:30.259
L-A-N-G.

44:30.293 --> 44:33.593
I wanna speak with you about something.
Are you free to talk?

44:34.088 --> 44:36.386
Yes. What is it?

44:36.591 --> 44:40.437
Miss Sherwood,
I understand you've had some difficulty.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.013
I want to help you.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.684
Miss Sherwood, do you hear me?

44:45.766 --> 44:46.938
I wanna help you.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.648
How can you help me?

44:48.936 --> 44:54.488
Well, now, my dear, this, uh, really isn't
the kind of thing we discuss on the phone.

44:54.567 --> 44:59.789
But if the names Larry and Harmon
mean anything to you,

44:59.864 --> 45:02.743
I suggest we spend
a few minutes in conversation.

45:04.285 --> 45:08.461
My dear, let me speak bluntly.
You're in trouble,

45:08.539 --> 45:11.292
and I'm the only one who can help you.

45:11.417 --> 45:15.047
Now, pull yourself together
and tell me that you understand that.

45:15.129 --> 45:17.131
<i>L... l understand.</i>

45:17.298 --> 45:19.642
Good, good.

45:19.675 --> 45:22.178
I'll have you picked up in 15 minutes.

45:22.261 --> 45:26.562
My office is downtown
and there'll be nothing improper.

45:26.641 --> 45:29.144
Don't worry about a thing,
I only wanna talk to you.

45:29.393 --> 45:30.690
(SObs)

45:30.770 --> 45:32.113
What do you mean?

45:32.563 --> 45:35.191
Just be ready in 15 minutes.

45:39.237 --> 45:40.489
Get her.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.214
(Laughing)

45:58.339 --> 46:00.762
Kim, would you please sit here?

46:05.179 --> 46:07.682
Sandra, you stay.

46:15.356 --> 46:16.573
Kim,

46:17.358 --> 46:21.534
uh, as I explained on the phone,
you're in trouble.

46:21.570 --> 46:24.039
And I'm the only one that can get you out.

46:30.288 --> 46:34.839
First of all, I want you to know
that I know everything.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.003
I know that you posed for Harmon.

46:38.546 --> 46:43.552
I know that certain pictures were taken of you
which, perhaps, didn't flatter you.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.767
I also know what Larry forced you to do,

46:48.973 --> 46:52.227
and that you want to go to Craxton
and you need money.

46:54.020 --> 46:57.524
You should understand
that if you do go to Craxton,

46:58.733 --> 47:02.454
this little episode in your life
will be completely over.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.075
You can forget about it.

47:04.113 --> 47:06.707
The pictures were of someone else.

47:06.741 --> 47:10.416
After four years in college,
it'll be a dead issue.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.543
But how can I go to Craxton?

47:13.581 --> 47:16.676
I can't pose for Harmon again.

47:16.751 --> 47:20.756
You can go to Craxton
and you can pose for Harmon again.

47:22.840 --> 47:26.435
Kim, you're in trouble.
You'd better listen to me.

47:27.470 --> 47:31.816
I won't pose again. I won't!
I don't care about Craxton!

47:31.932 --> 47:35.732
They can show their filthy pictures.
I don't care anymore!

47:35.770 --> 47:38.114
- Sit down!
- I'm leaving.

47:39.065 --> 47:42.239
Don't be a fool.
This is the only man who can help you.

47:42.276 --> 47:43.823
I'm getting out of here.

47:43.944 --> 47:48.290
Before you leave,
there's something you should hear.

47:48.324 --> 47:51.828
Larry, come in here through the front door.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.288
(Larry over intercom) Yeah, OK.

48:00.378 --> 48:02.881
Yes, Mr. Lang.

48:02.963 --> 48:04.510
(Scoffs)

48:04.590 --> 48:06.592
Well, well, well.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.980
If it ain't the Queen of Sheba.

48:11.013 --> 48:12.981
Or should I say Lady Godiva.

48:13.015 --> 48:15.689
All right, Larry, stop it.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.736
Now, listen and listen good.

48:17.812 --> 48:19.280
I'm issuing you an order.

48:20.147 --> 48:23.902
If I don't push that intercom
in exactly three minutes,

48:23.984 --> 48:28.785
I want you to make up 100 prints of Kim.
You got that?

48:30.658 --> 48:33.002
I got it, Mr. Lang.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.045
I'll work overtime on that.

48:35.121 --> 48:40.173
And the first print, the first print,
I want it to go to Mr. Sherwood.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.219
Kim's father. Have you got that?

48:43.212 --> 48:45.089
I got it, Mr. Lang.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.550
I'll make sure he gets two sets.

48:47.633 --> 48:49.260
All right, now get outta here.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.938
I said, get outta here.

48:58.185 --> 49:01.234
Now, Kim, you'd better sit down.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.701
We only have three minutes.

49:12.241 --> 49:15.290
It's time for straight talk, Kim.

49:18.080 --> 49:21.584
It's not my fault you posed for Harmon.

49:22.376 --> 49:27.348
It's not my fault
you posed for Larry in the nude.

49:27.381 --> 49:30.385
You did it. It's your problem.

49:30.468 --> 49:33.972
It's pretty late to act prissy and prim.

49:34.889 --> 49:38.018
All you kids make me sick.

49:38.058 --> 49:41.562
You act like Little Miss Muffet
and down inside you're dirty.

49:42.354 --> 49:45.403
Do you hear me? Dirty!

49:45.441 --> 49:50.572
You're greedy and self-centered
and think you can get away with anything!

49:51.405 --> 49:55.080
And you're no better than the girl
who sells herself to a man.

49:55.159 --> 49:58.504
You're worse because you're a hypocrite.

49:58.579 --> 50:04.336
And now, Little Miss Muffet is in trouble
and she's all outraged virtue.

50:04.960 --> 50:08.134
Well, you listen and you listen well!

50:08.214 --> 50:11.935
You're damaged merchandise
and this is a fire sale.

50:11.967 --> 50:17.019
And you walk out of here and your reputation
won't be worth 15 cents.

50:17.097 --> 50:21.273
You'll do as I tell you, do you hear?
You'll do as I tell you!

50:21.977 --> 50:23.399
(Lang sighs)

50:26.524 --> 50:27.901
I'm sorry.

50:27.942 --> 50:32.118
Sorry for the lecture, my dear,
but it was necessary.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.373
Now, listen well.

50:34.448 --> 50:36.200
There are two parts to this.

50:36.283 --> 50:40.379
Some of it you'll like,
some of it you may not like,

50:40.454 --> 50:43.207
but it won't hurt you, all right?

50:44.667 --> 50:48.888
All right.
Now, let's have the pleasant part first.

50:48.963 --> 50:52.433
You'll be given a paid-up,
one-year tuition to Craxton

50:52.466 --> 50:54.594
starting this fall.

50:58.264 --> 51:00.562
What's the unpleasant part?

51:00.891 --> 51:02.768
He didn't say unpleasant.

51:02.810 --> 51:06.235
He said you might not like it,
but it won't hurt you.

51:06.647 --> 51:08.490
I guarantee it won't.

51:09.692 --> 51:11.660
Here's what you do for the money.

51:13.571 --> 51:17.917
You'll pose for one day for Harmon.

51:18.826 --> 51:22.672
The shots will be nature studies

51:22.746 --> 51:27.343
with you, Sandra and another girl.

51:28.544 --> 51:32.048
If you do this graciously,

51:34.842 --> 51:38.437
I promise you this will be the end.

51:38.512 --> 51:44.019
Sandra has found some more willing models.

51:44.226 --> 51:46.194
You're in this?

51:46.270 --> 51:48.568
You're the one who got me to pose.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.237
Don't hate me, Kim.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.784
I was worse off than you.

51:55.863 --> 51:59.788
They've got shots of me with Ajax.

51:59.867 --> 52:01.790
'Max?

52:01.869 --> 52:05.089
These shots with you are my last.

52:05.164 --> 52:07.633
Mr. Lang is letting me get out.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.710
Kim, you're lucky.

52:09.793 --> 52:13.423
They don't have pictures of you, with a man.

52:14.006 --> 52:16.350
Let me make a point, my dear.

52:17.301 --> 52:21.898
Ajax... What's the word? Mmm, lusts.

52:22.014 --> 52:24.108
He lusts after you.

52:24.183 --> 52:26.732
He wants to be in pictures with you.

52:26.769 --> 52:31.741
I could've insisted that you do this,
but I'm a gentleman.

52:32.775 --> 52:35.324
Well, what's your answer?

52:35.653 --> 52:38.657
Let me ask you one question.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.748
Is Harmon in this with you?

52:44.370 --> 52:46.839
What do you think?

52:46.914 --> 52:49.133
Yes. What do you think?

52:51.585 --> 52:55.931
Mr. Lang, I've learned a lot
right here this afternoon.

52:57.091 --> 52:58.889
I guess I've grown up.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.431
I'll do what you say,

53:04.723 --> 53:09.354
but if this isn't the end,
I'll have to tell my father to call the police.

53:09.436 --> 53:12.861
Do you understand? I mean it.

53:12.940 --> 53:15.113
I know you do, my dear.

53:15.150 --> 53:16.902
And I respect your view.

53:19.530 --> 53:23.501
Larry, no prints of Miss Sherwood.

53:23.575 --> 53:26.124
You got that? No prints.

53:28.580 --> 53:31.459
And now, I think we can stand adjourned.

53:33.544 --> 53:35.546
(I Dramatic music)

53:40.634 --> 53:43.934
Marie, uh, you'd better be careful.

53:43.971 --> 53:46.269
I don't care anymore. I'm through.

53:46.306 --> 53:48.229
I'm going to the police.

53:48.308 --> 53:51.482
If I can turn chief evidence,
they can't do much to me.

53:52.479 --> 53:56.074
Don't worry, Sandra,
I won't tell about you or Harmon.

53:56.150 --> 54:00.326
But Larry, that Mr. Lang, and Ajax.

54:00.404 --> 54:02.657
They deserve what they're gonna get.

54:04.116 --> 54:05.663
If they find out?

54:05.743 --> 54:07.245
I don't care.

54:07.327 --> 54:09.830
By the time they do, they'll be under arrest.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.837
That Ajax shouldn't be allowed
to walk the streets.

54:14.084 --> 54:17.509
I'm gonna blow a whistle
on this operation once and for all.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.215
Marie, be careful.

54:25.679 --> 54:28.148
Too late for that now, baby.

54:30.517 --> 54:31.939
(Whistles) Ajax.

54:33.645 --> 54:35.318
(sighs)

54:35.355 --> 54:39.280
Ajax, Marie wants to leave us.

54:39.359 --> 54:42.454
I think you wanna persuade her to stay.

54:42.529 --> 54:45.578
(Laughs) I'm your boy.

54:48.494 --> 54:50.496
(I Orchestral music)

55:16.396 --> 55:17.693
(inaudible)

56:04.862 --> 56:07.365
One word and it's twice as hard on you.
We don't like quitters.

56:07.447 --> 56:10.291
Please! I wasn't gonna do anything, please.

56:10.576 --> 56:15.082
We was gonna give you a choice. Me or this.

56:15.122 --> 56:17.796
But now, I'm gonna give you a present. Both.

56:17.875 --> 56:19.127
(Shrieks) No.

56:19.209 --> 56:22.213
One more peep out of you and you get
twice <i>as</i> much, you understand?

56:22.296 --> 56:23.843
Let me go. Let me give what you want.

56:23.922 --> 56:26.141
Now, do you understand?

56:26.216 --> 56:27.388
Stand up.

56:28.176 --> 56:29.678
- Stand up!
- (Whimpers)

56:31.430 --> 56:33.103
(Struggling and screaming)

56:34.224 --> 56:35.726
Get onto that bed!

56:35.809 --> 56:37.982
- (Marie sobbing)
- (Laughing)

56:38.979 --> 56:40.981
(Belt snapping)

56:42.274 --> 56:44.322
(Marie continues crying)

56:44.359 --> 56:45.702
(Laughing)

56:51.491 --> 56:52.663
(Door closes)

57:29.404 --> 57:30.951
Get me the police.

57:39.414 --> 57:41.712
- (inaudible)
- (I Soft orchestral music)

58:34.052 --> 58:37.181
OK, Shirley, that's it.

58:37.264 --> 58:38.265
Have fun.

58:39.433 --> 58:41.777
You about ready for Ajax?

58:41.852 --> 58:45.902
Bring him on. I'm ready, willing and able.

58:49.609 --> 58:51.611
OK. Go ahead, Ajax.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.580
(Shirley giggling)

58:59.202 --> 59:01.375
OK, you guys can start anytime.

59:05.542 --> 59:06.794
(Ajax laughing)

59:08.420 --> 59:09.763
(Ajax) OOH...

59:09.796 --> 59:13.141
(Shirley) Whatever you can do, I can do better.

59:13.175 --> 59:16.679
- (Ajax) Oh, yeah?
- Now, don't look at the camera.

59:18.013 --> 59:19.185
(Shirley giggling)

59:31.443 --> 59:33.741
(Ajax and Shirley chuckling)

59:57.177 --> 59:58.724
Better her than me.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:01.853
Well, Sandra, is, uh, is Kim here with you?

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.559
Yeah, I let her in with my key.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:06.020
She's back in the dressing room
with the other girl.

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:09.782
Uh, OK, um, that's all. I ran out of film.

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.608
(Shirley moaning and giggling)

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.871
Come on, Ajax, cut that out.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.199
(Ajax) Aw, man. I was just getting started.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.457
I said cut it out!

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.119
(Shirley) You can finish it later, lover boy.

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.630
Eh, who wants to?

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.259
Say, stick around, will you, please, Shirley?

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.007
I have some other shots with another girl.

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:34.014
I'd like to get 'em out of the way
as quickly as possible.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:36.015
Sandy, would you go get Kim, please?

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:39.223
Don't bother. I'm here.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.514
- Well, Kim, I, um...
- Please don't.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.024
Where do I stand?

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:49.275
Over there.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.949
- (inaudible)
- (I Raunchy orchestral music)

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.332
Ajax, get out of there.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:14.416
You've made enough pictures already.
It's my turn now.

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:17.256
I said, get out of there.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:19.713
And I said it's my turn.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:22.181
Come on, lover. I'm ready.

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:23.850
Not you, baby.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:25.931
Her.

01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:30.390
The rest of you, scram! Beat it!

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.896
Ajax, I'm warning you. Stay away from her.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.561
I'm warning you, get away!

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.442
I've been watching. I want her!

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:39.319
(Kim sobbing)

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.776
(I Loud orchestral music)

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:48.749
(Screaming)

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.382
(I Soft orchestral music)

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.429
(Kim whimpering)

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:13.104
That, ladies and gentleman...

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.026
(Kim sobbing)

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.193
...is that.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.030
For all of us.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.192
All except you, Kim.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.908
Here, I got something for you.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:33.036
It's the negatives of all the shots
I've taken of you.

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:36.164
And here.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.626
As for today's award winners...

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:54.524
Now, listen, you...

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.562
You get out of here
and you weren't here tonight.

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:01.986
Remember, you weren't here tonight.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.408
(Continues sobbing)

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.237
(Breathing heavily)

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.773
You still say it was self-defense.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.900
We've heard that one before.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:42.652
Why did you hit him three times?

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:47.195
Well, you saw the size of that moose.
It took three times to get him down.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.951
I was only protecting myself. That's all.

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:53.283
Let's start all over again.
Maybe we can get the truth out of you.

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:57.705
He was trying to attack a girl,
I tried to stop him,

01:05:57.745 --> 01:06:00.544
he attacked me and I defended myself.

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.964
(Officer 1) And you just happened to have
a bat laying around?

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:07.263
It was for a photograph. It's just a prop.

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:09.887
(Officer 1) No more, it ain't.
It's evidence, now.

01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:11.726
What about this girl?

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.934
(Harmon) Well, she's a girl with blonde hair...

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:18.057
(Officer 2) What happened to this girl?

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.269
Well, she, uh, she ran.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:23.196
(Officer 2) I suppose she can verify this story.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.778
Yeah, yeah, if you can find her.

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.193
(Officer 1) What's her name?

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.737
Uh... I don't know.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.405
First time she ever posed for me.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:34.574
You don't expect us to swallow that?

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:38.082
I don't expect you to swallow anything.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.584
Look, friend, we knew this character.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.917
He was a bum,
and from his size and reputation,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.097
you'd have no trouble proving self-defense
if you can produce the girl.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:53.678
Why don't you save yourself a lot of trouble,
like a trip to the electric chair?

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.683
Now, where is she and what's her name?

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.937
I told you, I don't know where she is.

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:04.104
- (Sandra) Well, I do. She's right here.
- Well, Sandra...

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:05.939
Now, who's this?

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.451
Everything he says is true.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:12.033
That maniac tried to attack me.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.034
Harmon defended me.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:18.584
If you give me that baseball bat,
I'll give Ajax one more for the road.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:22.418
He was in this pornography ring
with a man named Lang.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:25.504
There's nothing like a nice feminine dame.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.132
Let's make a trip to see this fella Lang.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:31.715
How come this guy
would risk his life defending you?

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:36.019
Because... Because we're engaged.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:40.557
Yeah, just when did you two
become engaged?

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:46.946
Today.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.482
(I Dramatic music)

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:54.654
Are you sure?

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:56.949
All right, burn everything.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.742
Burn everything and then blow.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:03.042
Larry, get in here fast.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.012
(Door opens and closes)

01:08:12.964 --> 01:08:14.682
- ls something up, Mr. Lang?
- (Scoffs)

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:17.139
Ajax is dead. Harmon killed him.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:20.350
I don't know what's going on,
but it's every man for himself. Here.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.524
- You buy yourself a ticket to outer Mongolia.
- But, but...

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.194
Don't "but" your head against
this stone wall, my boy.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.897
A wise general knows when to retreat.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:31.108
Oh, wait. While you retreat, what'll I do?

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.443
Well, first you burn everything.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:36.200
And then you buy yourself
a huge supply of food

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:38.331
and you head for an all-night movie.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:43.461
That's about the only place I can think of
where the police might not look for you.

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:45.004
Wait a minute, is this all?

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.502
That's it. We're out of business, lad.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:50.589
Now, wait a minute.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:53.386
You mean, you're out of business, Mr. Lang.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:58.845
(Scoffs) But now I got a feeling
that you're gonna give me more money.

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:00.636
More money, like, now.

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:04.432
(Scoffs) You intuition is faulty, my lad.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.734
I (Larry) All right,
'ets Stop playing games, Lang.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:12.407
Either I get more loot
and I mean lots more loot,

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.325
or I buzz the fuzz,

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:18.496
which to squares like you
means I call the cops.

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:21.916
You forget, my boy, that if you call the police,

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:24.247
it'll do you a lot more harm than good.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.707
(Laughs) Oh, no.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:30.421
Don't you remember?
Well, you told me yourself.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.252
I'm a minor.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:36.093
The most I could get as a juvenile offender
is a year's probation.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:40.473
But you, Lang, you, you get five years.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:45.148
Well, that's five years of making
little bitty rocks out of great big ones.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.688
So, uh, do I get the money?

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:52.488
(Lang) In words of one syllable, kid, no!

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:56.864
All right, Mr. Lang. It's your funeral.

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:11.041
(Scoffs) No, no, my boy, it's your funeral.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:17.088
- (Larry) What, what... (Groans)
- (Gunshots)

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.288
(Door opens)

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.798
(Female operator) Operator, operator.
Trace <i>this</i> call.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.544
(I Dramatic music)

01:11:58.731 --> 01:11:59.732
(inaudible)

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:30.865
(Gunshot)

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.970
In a way, I'm sorry they're all dead.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.176
But I guess they got what they deserve.

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:50.684
Look, Kim, it's all over and done with.
Try and forget it.

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:53.267
Try and forget the whole sordid mess.

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:57.271
Just like it was a... Well, a bad, bad dream.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.398
You know, like it never really happened.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.024
I don't know if I ever really can.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.909
But I owe you and Sandy
an awful lot, Harmon,

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:09.032
for not getting me involved with the police.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:12.035
No, Kim, we owe you an awful lot.

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:16.540
Why, you turned us back into human beings
instead of a pair of animals.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:19.338
(Kim clicks tongue)

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:25.633
You know, Harmon, this is the first time
I've ever seen you wear a tie.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:30.012
What's that? (Laughs)
Well, I had to get dressed up.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.972
I'm going to a wedding.

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:34.474
- Oh... (Laughing)
- (Laughing) Goodbye, honey.

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:37.102
Good luck.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:38.433
(Car engine starts)

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:42.520
