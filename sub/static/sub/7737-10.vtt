00:06.307 --> 00:06.574
.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.208
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:08.376 --> 00:09.877
- I did some research,

00:09.910 --> 00:11.545
and there's all kinds
of specialized equipment

00:11.579 --> 00:13.581
at USC and up on Mount Wilson.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.549
- But it doesn't matter
because we're locked in here.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.185
- What if we aren't?

00:17.218 --> 00:18.986
- They found a tunnel
under an old DWP substation

00:19.019 --> 00:20.254
that leads right into downtown.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.755
- We can exploit this,

00:21.789 --> 00:24.024
set a trap for whoever's
using the tunnel.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.593
- I know what
you're going through.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.027
I have a daughter.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.363
She matters more to me
than anything.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.500
- This is a special book.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.435
It has all kinds
of secrets in it.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.870
- Your son Charlie is alive.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.906
- Those assholes were
close enough to take a picture

00:38.939 --> 00:40.874
of my son, and we still
don't have him home.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.611
- How long you been
spying on me, lying to me,

00:43.644 --> 00:46.414
selling me out to those killers
you work for?

00:46.447 --> 00:47.548
- I did it to protect you.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.250
- Bullshit!
You did it for you.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.918
- You could fight with us.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.886
We could fight together

00:52.920 --> 00:55.589
so that our kids
don't grow up in this.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.458
- Train is inbound.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.893
[explosion]

01:06.033 --> 01:07.868
- Eric?

01:17.711 --> 01:20.681
[tense music]

01:20.714 --> 01:28.722
*

01:38.499 --> 01:39.933
- Do you have any food?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.344
Please, I'm hungry.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.380
- I don't have anything.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.189
I said I don't have anything!

02:03.324 --> 02:04.492

02:04.525 --> 02:07.661
[chokes and gasps]

02:07.695 --> 02:11.432
[siren wailing]

02:11.465 --> 02:13.100
- Run!
Go!

02:13.201 --> 02:15.203
- Stop! Don't move!
- Get out of here!

02:15.203 --> 02:17.405
- Go left! Go left!
- Move it now!

02:17.438 --> 02:20.408
[dramatic music]

02:20.441 --> 02:27.981
*

02:28.015 --> 02:30.651

- Move! Come on!

02:30.684 --> 02:33.321
[sirens wailing]

02:33.354 --> 02:35.456
- Hey!
This way.

02:35.489 --> 02:39.327
*

02:39.360 --> 02:40.828
- Let's go!
Over here!

02:40.861 --> 02:42.496
[siren wailing]

02:42.530 --> 02:45.299
- Up ahead!
- Which way did they go?

02:45.333 --> 02:47.801
- I don't see 'em.
I've got no visual.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.037
- They're gone, sir.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.387
- Hey, Charlie.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.922
Check this out.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.259
- Cool.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.434
[gun clicks]

03:23.136 --> 03:24.705
Let's take this stuff
to Solomon,

03:24.738 --> 03:25.906
trade for some breakfast.

03:25.939 --> 03:33.947
*

03:38.452 --> 03:41.422

03:54.968 --> 03:57.971
[knock at door]

04:02.910 --> 04:04.912
- What?

04:07.114 --> 04:09.082
- Long night?

04:09.116 --> 04:11.652
- Yeah.
What's going on?

04:11.685 --> 04:15.523
- The Resistance
kidnapped a VIP.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.458
It's all hands on deck.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.933
I stopped by Beau's place
on the way over here.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.001
He was gone.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.670
I don't know why
I'm on the outside,

04:29.703 --> 04:33.073
but it's not cool
because when you screw up,

04:33.106 --> 04:34.942
it's gonna blow back on me.

04:34.975 --> 04:38.011
- You were on the outside
so it won't blow back on you.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.980
- [scoffs]

04:42.383 --> 04:45.353
[tense music]

04:45.386 --> 04:53.226
*

04:53.260 --> 04:55.262
- Good morning.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.797
My name is Helena Goldwyn.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.400
I am the chief of staff
for the Governor-General.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.703
Early this morning
a VIP coming into the bloc

05:02.736 --> 05:06.006
was attacked and abducted.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.377
- Who?

05:09.377 --> 05:11.379
- It was one of our Hosts.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.117
- Where's Snyder?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.387
- I will personally be running
this recovery operation.

05:19.387 --> 05:22.055
Everything now comes through me.

05:22.089 --> 05:25.493
You should know that this
is not a good situation.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.794
During the Arrival,

05:26.827 --> 05:29.630
two of our Hosts
were killed in Dallas.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.501
That city is now
a flat sheet of glass.

05:33.534 --> 05:38.506
We have a brief window
before they take action.

05:38.539 --> 05:42.543
Understood?

05:42.576 --> 05:47.415
Then go out there and find it
and whoever took it.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.418
[indistinct chatter]

05:50.418 --> 05:59.026
*

05:59.059 --> 06:01.328
- Think you used
enough dynamite there, Butch?

06:01.429 --> 06:03.063
- We're lucky you didn't bring
down the whole bloody tunnel.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.665
What happened?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.166
- I-I think I missed
an exponent when I did the calc.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.968
- You think?
- It worked.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.837
- It worked? You killed it.
- You sure it's dead?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.472
- Do I look like
an alien doctor?

06:11.505 --> 06:12.673
- It sure as shit ain't moving.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.908
- We need to dump it.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.109
- You're not serious.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.678
- Our target was a live human,

06:17.711 --> 06:19.680
one we could interrogate,
not a dead RAP.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.115
- Do you not understand
the value of this thing?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.084
We know literally nothing
about it.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.853
- What can we learn from it?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.288
- Tons of stuff like how it
breathes, how it communicates.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.857
- Whether it's
a carbon-based form of life.

06:29.890 --> 06:30.924
- Yeah. How it interfaces
with its environment.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.926
- Maybe it has a weapon too.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.796
- Every Redhat in the bloc is
about to come gunning for us.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.131
Are we ready to risk our lives
for that?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.870
- Yes.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.606
- We need to get out
of the tunnels.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.840
- Back to the loft.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.713
- We'll wrap it up
and carry it out.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.982
File formation,
bounding overwatch.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.318
Never be more than 20 yards away
from cover.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.687
- It might have a locator.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.622
- You're just telling us
this now?

07:01.655 --> 07:03.491
- If they can track it, why
aren't we surrounded by Redhats?

07:03.491 --> 07:05.759
- We're underground.
- B.B., you got the RF meter?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.795
- Yeah.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.134
[meter hums]

07:14.167 --> 07:21.074

07:21.108 --> 07:22.309
[meter buzzes]

07:22.342 --> 07:23.911
Shit.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.045
- We can block the signal.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.814
- How?
How do you do that?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.416
- A Faraday cage, right?
We just need to cover it, right?

07:29.517 --> 07:31.519
Anything metallic.

07:31.519 --> 07:39.527
*

07:45.265 --> 07:47.535
- What about this?
- Perfect.

07:47.535 --> 07:55.776
*

07:55.809 --> 07:57.811
- Wait, wait, wait.
Let's check it right here.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.580
Let's just check it.

07:59.613 --> 08:03.183
Put it down.
Okay, okay.

Nothing.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.362
- If you're wrong,
we're dead.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.998
Are you sure?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.433
*

08:20.467 --> 08:22.469
- Sure enough.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.341
- Let's go.

08:47.094 --> 08:47.327
.

08:47.360 --> 08:47.661
- I like soap.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.231
- That's not a cereal.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.466
- Maddie.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.468
- I know,
but you can't get any.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.605
- I like the other cereal
better.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.439
- What's the matter?

08:59.472 --> 09:00.874
- The Resistance
kidnapped a VIP.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.275
All hell's
about to break loose.

09:02.309 --> 09:06.213
We got to get the kids
somewhere safe.

09:06.246 --> 09:10.217
- I can get them
into the Green Zone.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.519
I've been working for the number
two in the political wing.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.989
He'll help me.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.725
I'll take care of it.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.159
- Good.
Okay, that's good.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.361
Go pack some things
and go now.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.530
- What about Katie?

09:23.631 --> 09:25.365
- You deal with the kids.
I'll deal with her.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.533
Okay, go.
- All right.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.475
- Hey, no school today.
- Why?

09:35.508 --> 09:37.244
- You're going up to
Green Zone with Aunt Maddie.

09:37.277 --> 09:41.048
- Why?
- The bloc's going on lockdown.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.550
Do you know where Mom is?

09:43.651 --> 09:47.154
- No.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.658
- What did she tell you?

09:50.658 --> 09:55.262
You know what she's been doing,
don't you?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.164
- I have an idea.

09:57.197 --> 10:01.234
- Where is she?
- I don't know where she is!

10:01.268 --> 10:03.003
I'm serious!

10:03.036 --> 10:04.772
- I know you think
we're on different sides here,

10:04.805 --> 10:06.539
but we're not.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.208
The difference is
I know what I'm doing,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.510
and your mom has no idea
how bad of a situation

10:10.543 --> 10:12.680
she's gotten herself into.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.581
She's in real danger, son.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.550
I can help her, but I need
to get to her right now.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.790
- She gave me a number.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.524
Let me come with you.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.026
I can help.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.728
- You can help me
by getting to the Green Zone

Gracie, and Hudson.

25:04.003 --> 25:08.307
*

25:08.340 --> 25:12.612
You know, trust is about a lot
more than just one-sided favors.

25:12.645 --> 25:20.653
*

25:22.354 --> 25:24.156
What's that?

25:24.190 --> 25:25.958
- Resistance code book.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.728
*

25:28.761 --> 25:29.796
- Holy shit.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.297
- What do you think it is?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.899
- I think it's a freaking
dead alien.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.466
- Body armor seems to be
some kind of alloy,

25:34.500 --> 25:37.804
but this fibrous mesh,
this is--this is pliable.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.506
- Mmm, check out this membrane
at the nape of the neck.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.974
- We need to cut it open.

25:42.008 --> 25:42.975
- We don't know
what's inside this thing.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.611
- Yeah, exactly.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.746
- What if the suit
isn't protecting it from us?

25:46.779 --> 25:48.447
What if it's protecting us
from it?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.150
- Are we seriously
debating theory right now?

25:51.183 --> 25:52.484
Do they know
what they're doing?

25:52.518 --> 25:54.754
- Science is rarely elegant.

25:54.787 --> 25:55.922
Cut it open.

25:55.955 --> 25:59.091
*

25:59.125 --> 26:02.629
- 47, 9, 9.

26:02.629 --> 26:05.497
*

26:05.531 --> 26:07.533
- "Engineer."

26:07.634 --> 26:09.268
- We got the message
off the woman

26:09.301 --> 26:11.370
Lagarza killed
in the market, right?

26:11.403 --> 26:13.405
Must have been what called her
to the meeting.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.775
The message mentions
a "special opportunity"

26:15.808 --> 26:17.243
with a "new engineer."

26:17.276 --> 26:19.411
- The kind of engineer

26:19.445 --> 26:22.882
who might be able
to block a tracking signal?

26:22.915 --> 26:24.083
- Do you have
the surveillance video?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.753
- Yeah.

26:26.786 --> 26:32.859
*

26:32.892 --> 26:35.862
[saw buzzing]

26:35.895 --> 26:39.431
*

26:39.465 --> 26:42.969
- Try again.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.671
- Okay.

26:44.671 --> 26:48.040
There they are walking
toward the woman who was killed.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.876
- Wait.
Right there.

26:49.909 --> 26:51.477
Broussard reacts to something.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.980
He starts to move away
from Quayle, then he speaks,

26:54.013 --> 26:55.948
but not to Quayle.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.684
Pull wide.

26:57.684 --> 27:01.120
There.
That guy.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.690
- Okay.
Let's find out who he is.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.693
[saw buzzing]

27:06.693 --> 27:15.567
*

27:15.601 --> 27:17.203
- It's Simon Eckhart,

27:17.236 --> 27:21.173
English expat, degree
in aeronautical engineering.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.475
Before the Arrival,
he was the founder and CEO

27:23.509 --> 27:26.746
of a startup
that was making micro drones.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.981
His home and business address

27:29.015 --> 27:33.519
are both listed
as a loft on Fairfax.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.988
*

27:36.022 --> 27:38.725
- I need a 20-minute
head start.

27:38.758 --> 27:42.862
You know why I'm asking.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.563
I'm the reason we got that guy.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.165
Just let me get her out.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.769
*

27:49.802 --> 27:53.239
- 20 minutes.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.742
- I owe you big.

28:04.751 --> 28:04.851
.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.321
- Alan.

28:09.956 --> 28:10.656
What can I do for you?

28:11.423 --> 28:12.058
- As I'm sure
you already know,

28:12.925 --> 28:16.295
my reign is coming
to a premature end.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.898
I want your boss
to replace me.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.232
- How's he gonna do that?

28:20.299 --> 28:22.001
- Helena needs
to convince our Hosts

28:22.068 --> 28:24.336
that this bloc
can be salvaged.

28:27.639 --> 28:30.342
This is the emergency protocol
that the Transitional Authority

28:30.409 --> 28:31.410
used in Seattle.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.079
They quelled an uprising

28:33.145 --> 28:37.383
with minimal population loss,
which pleased our Hosts.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.051
- How'd you get that?

28:39.118 --> 28:41.553
- The Governor-General
up there was a friend of mine.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.190
Your boss needs
to bring this plan to Helena

28:44.256 --> 28:47.493
and convince her that he's
the man to implement it.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.930
I guarantee
she'll be receptive.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.664
- And what's the price?

28:52.799 --> 28:56.602
- I want at least a level three
job in the Authority,

28:56.668 --> 28:58.938
and I want to keep one
of my houses.

29:03.609 --> 29:07.246
- I'll see what I can do.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.448
- "I'll see what I can do"?

29:09.515 --> 29:12.284
After all
that I've done for you?

29:12.351 --> 29:14.987
No, I'm sorry.
Nolan, that's not nearly enough.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.824
- Alan, it's just a big ask,
you know?

29:17.890 --> 29:20.927
And I don't know where all
the cards are gonna fall yet.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.930
But you have my word.
I'll do whatever I can.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.933
[tense music]

29:26.999 --> 29:34.974
*

29:37.977 --> 29:39.979
[gunfire and explosions]

29:40.046 --> 29:41.147
- They're starting again.

29:41.213 --> 29:44.516
- We don't have anything yet.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.853
- Let's just try this.
- Like that?

29:46.886 --> 29:49.021
- And then--hold on.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.623
- It's over, Eric.
We got to let this go.

29:51.690 --> 29:54.026
[saw buzzing]
- Faster.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.361
That good?
- All right.

29:55.427 --> 30:03.402
*

30:10.376 --> 30:12.644
- We've been
approaching this the wrong way.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.013
We're trying to brute force it,

30:14.080 --> 30:18.317
but this is tech,
not mechanical, so--

30:18.384 --> 30:21.387
[indistinct chatter]

30:26.325 --> 30:28.594
- This is so not rocket science.
- Let's try something.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.600
- Whoa, shit.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.834
- Oh, nice one.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.369
Do that again.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.105
[beeps]

30:39.171 --> 30:42.574
- Whoa.
- Hey.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.443
- Oh, look at that.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.345
- This must be
its communications protocol.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.846
- What does that mean?

30:47.914 --> 30:49.949
- It's how it interfaces
with its hardware.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.884
This is huge.
- That's great.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.953
- Yes, but we're going to need
both its male and female ports

30:54.020 --> 30:55.621
if we're going--
[banging on door]

30:55.687 --> 30:57.856
- Katie, open the damn door!

30:57.924 --> 30:59.525
- It's Will. That's Will.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.427
- Will? Who's Will?
- Her husband.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.628
- Katie!

31:02.694 --> 31:05.664
[bangs on door]

31:10.402 --> 31:12.704
I'm not here
to argue with you.

31:12.771 --> 31:16.108
All I want
is what you have in there.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.643
Is it alive?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.378
- I don't think so.
- Jesus Christ, Katie.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.180
- Who else is with you?
- I'm alone.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.815
I bought myself a head start,
but it won't last long.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.317
They're coming for all of you,

31:25.384 --> 31:28.620
and I'm not gonna
be able to stop them.

31:28.687 --> 31:29.721
Did you hear what I said?

31:29.788 --> 31:31.223
- Yes.

31:33.159 --> 31:34.493
- Give me the RAP.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.196
The rest of you left
before I got here.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.065
You already made your point.

31:39.131 --> 31:41.567
You can't win.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.135
- I know.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.370
- The whole city's
burning down out here.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.972
Is that what you wanted?

31:45.972 --> 31:47.539
- Never.
Never.

31:47.606 --> 31:48.807
- You have minutes.

31:48.874 --> 31:51.543
You have to get out now!

31:51.610 --> 31:52.644
- Let me talk to them.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.513
- Leave them!
I can get you out.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.984
Unlock the door.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.885
Katie!
Damn it!

31:59.986 --> 32:01.053
[pounds on door]

32:01.120 --> 32:02.754
Katie!

32:07.059 --> 32:08.995
- I want to know
what the hell is going on,

32:08.995 --> 32:10.896
and I want to know now.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.664
- My husband
works for the Occupation.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.400
- What?
- Is this a setup?

32:14.466 --> 32:15.567
Did you set us up?

32:15.634 --> 32:17.169
- Calm down.
It's not a setup.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.304
- Then how did he find us?

32:18.370 --> 32:19.771
- He's good at his job.

32:19.838 --> 32:21.407
- Will's an ally.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.242
He's been feeding us intel
on the Occupation.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.077
- That wasn't something you felt
like you needed to disclose?

32:25.144 --> 32:27.479
- He came here to warn us.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.682
Homeland is coming
with everything they have,

32:30.749 --> 32:32.784
and when they get here, we will
not be able to hold them back.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.620
- We need more time.
- You don't have it.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.188
They're right behind him.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.024
- Broussard, we're close.
- Ten minutes.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.625
- In ten minutes,
they will all be dead.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.027
We have something, Eric.

32:41.027 --> 32:43.095
Make the call.

32:43.162 --> 32:47.033
- Five minutes.

32:47.066 --> 32:50.036
This could be our only chance
to examine a RAP.

32:50.536 --> 32:51.603
*

32:51.670 --> 32:52.604
Shit.

- No!
Katie!

[machine beeps]

33:05.917 --> 33:07.953
- What are you doing?
They're gonna find us.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.588
- You broke containment?
Why?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.123
Why would you break containment?

33:11.190 --> 33:12.958
- Save your lives.
- Save us?

33:13.059 --> 33:16.062
They're gonna nuke us.
- Not if we leave right now.

[dramatic music]

33:19.131 --> 33:22.934
*

33:23.069 --> 33:23.969
- Let's go.

33:28.207 --> 33:35.714
*

33:35.781 --> 33:38.450
- Please go.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.088
- Nice work.

35:57.122 --> 36:00.759
Was anyone inside?

36:00.792 --> 36:03.462
- Just him.

36:03.495 --> 36:11.503
*

36:17.509 --> 36:19.245
- Thank you.

36:19.245 --> 36:24.250
You have no idea what you
prevented by finding our VIP.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.252
- Told you
I could find anybody.

36:26.252 --> 36:29.255
[helicopter whirring]

36:29.255 --> 36:31.990
- Here.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.793
This will get you through
the Santa Monica Gateway.

36:38.797 --> 36:42.268
Go find your son.

36:42.268 --> 36:44.936
That Transit Pass was authorized
under my authority,

36:44.970 --> 36:48.274
so if you're gonna use it,
I suggest you go now.

36:48.307 --> 36:53.779

36:53.812 --> 36:55.781
You're an honorable man, Will.

Don't let them take
that from you.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.453

at the chief of staff

37:36.187 --> 37:39.157
to the next proxy governor.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.959
- Oh, my God.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.994
- I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.631
- Oh, congratulations.

37:45.664 --> 37:49.468
- This is gonna be
so good for us.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.870
- Oh, my God!
No way!

37:51.903 --> 37:53.972
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, they can be loud.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.807
- That's okay. I like it.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.676
It makes the house
feel more alive,

37:57.709 --> 37:59.978
and I know why
they're so happy.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.914
I brought someone here to make
them feel more at home.

Come here.

Hey, guys.

What a nice surprise.

It's the wall.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.781
- I mean, it's amazing.
- Hands up!

39:09.815 --> 39:11.750
On your knees!
- Get down!

Freeze!
- Get on the ground!

39:13.652 --> 39:15.687
- Give me your hands!
- Go! Move!

39:15.721 --> 39:17.423
- Stay down!
- Come here, now.

["The Cold"
by Exitmusic]

39:21.760 --> 39:29.435
- * A cold arm

39:29.435 --> 39:31.102
* Returns the stolen

39:31.136 --> 39:32.137
- Sir.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.108
- I'm leaving.

39:37.142 --> 39:40.078
- * A new start

39:40.111 --> 39:41.880
- Just give me
a couple minutes.

39:41.913 --> 39:46.585
*

39:46.618 --> 39:49.254
- * A red light

39:49.287 --> 39:51.723
- I need you to come with me.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.059
*

39:54.092 --> 40:00.899
- * Hey, you

40:00.932 --> 40:10.408
* An early fall descended

40:10.442 --> 40:13.311
*

40:13.344 --> 40:19.150
* Hey

40:19.184 --> 40:26.257
* You are alone

40:26.291 --> 40:29.360
- Sir, the exclusion zone
is straight ahead.

40:29.394 --> 40:30.996
You and your vehicle
will both be scanned

40:31.029 --> 40:33.765
before you
can enter Santa Monica.

40:33.799 --> 40:39.938
- * You are alone

40:39.971 --> 40:44.009
*

40:44.042 --> 40:53.652
* I read it in the paper

40:53.685 --> 40:56.788
*

40:56.822 --> 41:02.528
* Hey

41:02.528 --> 41:08.066
* You are alone

41:08.099 --> 41:13.104
*

41:13.138 --> 41:17.442
* Other than this song

41:17.543 --> 41:21.312
* I've been silent

41:21.346 --> 41:23.982
* And stoic

41:24.015 --> 41:27.553
*

41:27.586 --> 41:35.093
* Crazy, I denied you so

41:35.126 --> 41:41.967
*

41:42.000 --> 41:47.906
* Sing another song

41:47.939 --> 41:56.314
* Ah

41:56.347 --> 41:59.250
*
