01:30.289 --> 01:32.280
Oh, my God. Stuart.

01:32.357 --> 01:35.485
- What is it?
- Tom's grades finally posted.

01:36.962 --> 01:40.398
- Look.

01:40.466 --> 01:43.401
- Not one "A. "
- No.

01:43.469 --> 01:45.437
- Or a " B."
- Mm-mmm.

01:45.504 --> 01:48.371
- Not even in Health.

01:49.908 --> 01:52.502
- What the--
- That was just a "D".

01:52.578 --> 01:54.705
- How are these changing?

02:00.085 --> 02:02.485
One word, and you're dead.

02:04.790 --> 02:08.089
Are you crazy?
If Dad catches you, he's gonna kill you.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.095
Dad's not gonna catch me.

02:11.163 --> 02:13.495
Mwah! I don't get it.
What do you see in that guy?

02:13.565 --> 02:15.658
Bye, babe!

02:15.734 --> 02:18.669
You mean, other than the fact
that he's good-looking, sweet...

02:18.737 --> 02:23.265
sensitive, romantic, funny
and ridiculously athletic?

02:23.342 --> 02:28.279
- Dad's coming, and he's mad.
- At who?

02:28.347 --> 02:30.577
- Tom.
- Tom!

02:34.319 --> 02:37.584
What? If you're smart enough
to hack into the school Web site...

02:37.656 --> 02:39.590
then you are smart enough to pass math.

02:39.658 --> 02:43.651
Do you think Bethany got accepted to Michigan
by screwing around all the time?

02:43.729 --> 02:47.187
Of course not.
She got in 'cause she's perfect.

02:47.266 --> 02:51.066
No. Your sister worked her tail off,
and that's exactly what I expect from you.

02:51.136 --> 02:53.127
Yeah. You're right, Dad.

02:53.205 --> 02:55.173
I-I-I don't deserve a family vacation.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.231
I should stay home tomorrow, learn my lesson.

02:57.309 --> 03:00.210
Oh, no, no. I am not taking that bait, kiddo.

03:00.279 --> 03:04.215
This isn't you. The bad attitude, the grades.
What is going on?

03:04.283 --> 03:06.808
Nothing.

03:06.885 --> 03:10.616
I blame all this
for coming between this right here.

03:10.689 --> 03:13.715
Some good old-fashioned no-tech--

03:13.792 --> 03:15.259
- Uh--

03:15.327 --> 03:18.421
family togetherness is exactly what we need.

03:19.698 --> 03:22.360
So get some sleep.
We're hitting the road at sunup.

03:22.434 --> 03:24.698
Oh, and you guys too.

03:44.389 --> 03:48.257
Hannah. Please, next time,
you ride the hump, okay?

03:48.327 --> 03:51.194
I barf in the middle. Remember?

04:09.881 --> 04:12.611
And that's the farm report.
In other news, it looks like...

04:12.684 --> 04:15.346
there will be more than just fireworks
in the sky tonight...

04:15.420 --> 04:18.856
as an unexpected meteor shower adds a little
excitement to our area this holiday weekend.

04:18.923 --> 04:22.826
- Very exciting. We're in for a little bit of a show.
- That'll be beautiful, guys.

04:22.894 --> 04:26.523
Better wear hats tonight.
We don't want our heads catching on fire.

04:32.638 --> 04:34.606
- Wow.

04:34.673 --> 04:36.732
- Hey.
- Your boy toy is a complete idiot.

04:36.808 --> 04:39.003
Ricky is not a boy toy.

04:39.077 --> 04:41.204
- We're in a mature, loving relationship.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.545
Why don't we talk in a few years
when you have a clue what dating's all about?

04:44.616 --> 04:49.076
Like Ricky has a clue? One more word
about Ricky, and I swear to God I'll kill you.

04:49.154 --> 04:52.590
Okay. That is enough.
Knock it off, you guys.

04:52.658 --> 04:54.649
We're almost there.

05:13.045 --> 05:15.377
And there's the pool. See ya!

05:15.447 --> 05:18.814
We beat Uncle Nate! Oh, yeah! Ha-ha!

05:19.918 --> 05:22.580
- Ah.
- I got it, Tom. Don't worry.

05:22.654 --> 05:25.088
- Nice, huh?
- Great, yes. I'll grab that.

05:25.157 --> 05:29.355
I hope there was a discount for booking us
into the most boring spot in the whole country.

05:29.428 --> 05:32.625
We're only a stone's throw away from
at least a half dozen top-notch fishing lakes.

05:32.698 --> 05:36.464
Are we near a time machine so we can go back
5 years to when I thought fishing was cool?

05:36.535 --> 05:40.801
Hey, I bought us all new Sidestab reels.
Anti-Reverse technology.

05:42.107 --> 05:43.768
Lame.

05:54.853 --> 05:56.787
So lame.

06:31.723 --> 06:33.714
- Nice landing, Nate.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.783
Told you I could fishtail this thing.

06:35.861 --> 06:38.523
Nice try, Nate, but you just missed my kids.

06:38.597 --> 06:41.760
But he did almost give
your mother a heart attack.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.858
- Again.
- Nana!

06:43.935 --> 06:45.869
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, hi, darling.

06:45.937 --> 06:48.929
- Nana!
- Yes, sweetheart!

06:49.007 --> 06:50.941
Ooh!

06:51.009 --> 06:52.977
- I got you a little treat.
- You did?

06:53.044 --> 06:55.877
Yes, I did. Here we go.

06:55.947 --> 06:57.881
- Thank you.

06:57.949 --> 07:01.214
- Oh, it's so good to see you. I missed you.
- Hey. We're here.

07:02.954 --> 07:06.355
Well, one of the Pearson brothers
came to party.

07:06.425 --> 07:10.054
- Are those even legal here?
- No.

07:10.128 --> 07:12.824
Here! Come on, Stu! Let's get him!

07:12.898 --> 07:15.833
- Nate, stop it! I'll tell Mom.
- Tickle him! Tickle your uncle!

07:15.901 --> 07:18.893
- Spin him faster, Nate!
- Get his shirt off!

07:21.473 --> 07:23.805
Aw, Stuey's crying for Mommy!

07:28.547 --> 07:30.674
Twins, in here.

07:30.749 --> 07:33.013
- Hey, guys.
- Put my bags on the bed.

07:33.084 --> 07:35.143
Sir, yes, sir.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.519
- Trying to be a wise guy?
- No. No. Definitely not. Don't provoke him.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.854
Good. Now, get these out of here.

07:40.926 --> 07:44.384
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
Why do you get the best room? I was here first.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.988
- I'm here now.
- I'm older.

07:47.065 --> 07:49.829
And I'm bigger.

07:49.901 --> 07:52.836
Did you... grow since Christmas?

07:52.904 --> 07:56.601
2 inches, cuz. I can tag a stop sign
without even having to jump.

07:56.675 --> 07:59.872
How's Mathletes?

07:59.945 --> 08:02.436
I don't do Mathletes anymore.

08:02.514 --> 08:05.677
- You tired of getting beat up?
- Tom!

08:05.750 --> 08:09.777
Get down here and help us unload! Now!

08:09.855 --> 08:11.846
Close my door on the way out.

08:28.840 --> 08:32.434
- Surprise, surprise, princess.
- Ricky, what are you doing here?

08:32.510 --> 08:34.479
Oh, I'm just stopping by for the afternoon...

08:34.546 --> 08:36.342
or maybe the night.

08:44.656 --> 08:47.090
- What's that?
- What's what?

08:47.158 --> 08:50.286
- Ricky!
- Hey! Mmm!

08:50.362 --> 08:52.592
- Whoa. Watch out for the car.
- I can't believe you're here.

08:52.664 --> 08:54.655
Well, you're my girl friend now...

08:54.733 --> 08:57.133
so there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

08:57.202 --> 08:59.466
- Now, give papa some sugar.

08:59.538 --> 09:02.268
Bethany. Please don't give papa sugar.

09:04.376 --> 09:06.469
Mr. and Mrs. P!

09:06.545 --> 09:09.343
- Ricky, wow!
- Hey, Ricky! What a surprise.

09:09.414 --> 09:12.008
- I got you a little housewarming gift.
- Oh, that is so sweet.

09:12.083 --> 09:15.018
- Isn't he sweet?
- Yes. They're beautiful.

09:15.086 --> 09:17.281
Those are gorgeous. Yeah.
Very patriotic too, huh?

09:17.355 --> 09:19.323
Let's stick the flags in some water,
see if they grow.

09:19.391 --> 09:21.951
We can do that.
Do you want anything to eat or drink?

09:22.027 --> 09:25.929
Oh, that is so sweet of you.
I really wish I could.

09:25.997 --> 09:27.589
But my parents have
a lake house in Oaks town...

09:27.666 --> 09:30.863
and I gotta get back before dark
in case my car breaks down again.

09:30.936 --> 09:34.770
- Uh-oh. Car trouble. Hmm.
- Dad, why don't you take a look at it for Ricky?

09:34.839 --> 09:37.672
Yeah, I don't mind getting my hands dirty.

09:37.742 --> 09:40.040
- Try it again, Ricky.

09:40.111 --> 09:42.341
It's gotta be something obvious, Dad.

09:42.414 --> 09:45.713
I got to be honest with you.
Automechanics isn't really my thing.

09:45.784 --> 09:48.981
Now, if this were a spreadsheet or a ledger,
I would be all over it, but--

09:49.054 --> 09:51.352
- I'll tell you what, Ricky. Stay here tonight...

09:51.423 --> 09:54.017
and then we'll take your car
to the shop in the morning.

09:54.092 --> 09:56.560
Mr. P, that's really considerate of you.

09:56.628 --> 09:58.323
- Well--
- Really? He can stay the night?

09:58.396 --> 10:00.887
- Yeah, in the den, on the couch.
- Of course.

10:00.966 --> 10:03.161
- No fooling around.
- Dad.

10:03.268 --> 10:05.828
What a gas pipe.

10:05.904 --> 10:08.372
I know. Why can't they see that?

10:08.440 --> 10:10.533
Well, dude, parents are wired differently.

10:10.609 --> 10:14.477
Their brains are old, mushy,
fried from bad '80s music.

10:14.546 --> 10:16.537
That's why it's up to you, Thomas.

10:16.615 --> 10:19.311
You gotta defend your family honor,
like a man.

10:20.085 --> 10:24.181
I call it the Punisher.

10:24.255 --> 10:26.951
- Your dad bought you this?
- Perks of divorce.

10:27.025 --> 10:29.858
Never underestimate the power
of a grown man's guilt.

10:29.928 --> 10:33.329
If we even mention Mom,
Nate drives us straight to the mall.

10:34.566 --> 10:37.729
She's all yours.
Don't be a wuss all your life.

10:37.802 --> 10:40.100
Uh-- I don't know, man.

10:43.341 --> 10:45.332
Take a look at that guy.

10:45.410 --> 10:49.744
- Do you really want Ricky as your brother-in-law?

10:52.851 --> 10:54.682
Heck, no.

10:54.753 --> 10:57.745
Then let's go prune the family tree.

10:59.224 --> 11:01.454
I had so much fun last night, Ricky.

11:01.526 --> 11:07.123
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
that's just the beginning.

11:07.198 --> 11:11.362
Man, the sun off the water and...
this lightweight cotton...

11:11.436 --> 11:16.100
is... so... constricting.

11:16.174 --> 11:18.438
I hate cotton.

11:18.510 --> 11:22.105
Mind helping me with the lotion, babe?

11:27.085 --> 11:30.612
I'm thinking shooting my sister's boyfriend
isn't the best idea.

11:30.689 --> 11:34.147
This isn't about ideas. This is about action.

11:34.225 --> 11:36.159
Don't think. Do.

11:36.227 --> 11:39.492
I can't believe I'm even listening to you.
You're dressed like a shrub.

11:40.899 --> 11:43.459
- Just a little on my chest.
- Target is on the move.

11:43.535 --> 11:47.096
- Take him out before he reaches 2nd base.
- Nah. I don't think that--

11:54.679 --> 11:57.113
- Why did you do that?
- Shut up. You'll compromise our position.

11:59.818 --> 12:02.252
Oh, my God. She saw us.
What do we do? What do we do?

12:02.320 --> 12:06.256
Camo mode. Hunker down and blend.

12:08.560 --> 12:12.018
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You shot my boyfriend.

12:12.097 --> 12:14.861
"Sorry" doesn't even touch that.
When, Tom?

12:14.933 --> 12:17.629
When are you gonna grow up
and stop being a total embarrassment?

12:18.837 --> 12:21.635
And that's why we use camo.

12:21.706 --> 12:23.765
Shut up, Jake.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.769
- Ooh!
- Are you gonna be okay?

12:27.846 --> 12:29.939
I don't know what you were thinking.
I really don't.

12:30.014 --> 12:32.005
- Yeah, I'm gonna be all right.
- A paintball gun.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.278
- This was a good idea though, Miss Smarty-Pants.
- That's a gateway gun.

12:34.352 --> 12:36.684
How about what's next?
B.B.? Pellet?

12:36.755 --> 12:40.885
Stun? What am I gonna do? What do you
think I should do? I don't know what to do.

12:40.959 --> 12:43.359
Can't you keep him in his room
for the rest of the week?

12:43.428 --> 12:47.057
- But it wasn't even me. Okay, you boys
are just lucky that Ricky wasn't badly hurt.

12:47.132 --> 12:49.999
It's okay, Mr. P.
I was a little kid once too.

12:50.068 --> 12:53.037
Oh, that's nice, Ricky.
Thank you. He's a good guy.

12:53.104 --> 12:56.096
He's a good guy.
But, no, I'm not okay with this.

12:56.174 --> 12:59.109
Look, we're up here to fish,
not to hunt your sister's boyfriend, all right?

12:59.177 --> 13:03.739
You could have put his eye out.
Would that have been funny? I don't think so.

13:05.150 --> 13:07.584
All right, let's start over with a clean slate.

13:07.652 --> 13:09.882
Tomorrow, we fish.

13:09.954 --> 13:11.649
- 7:00 a.m. sharp.
- 7:00?

13:11.723 --> 13:14.317
- You're kidding.
- Pass. Nate?

13:14.392 --> 13:17.759
Yeah, Stu. Don't you think that's a little early?
How about this?

13:17.829 --> 13:20.889
10:00 a.m., on the boat, no questions asked.

13:20.965 --> 13:23.991
Way to crack the whip, Nate.
Way to crack the whip.

13:31.075 --> 13:34.533
Oh, Stu. Stu.

13:34.612 --> 13:37.479
Natey, the TV's gone haywire.

13:37.549 --> 13:39.540
Stu, TV's gone haywire!

13:39.617 --> 13:43.451
- Mom. Mom, stop it. It's probably the dish.

13:43.521 --> 13:45.512
After the storm,
I'll climb up on the roof and fix it.

13:45.590 --> 13:48.457
Hey, wait a second, Mr. P.
Let me fix the dish, man.

13:48.526 --> 13:50.517
That's the least I can do for your hospitality.

13:50.595 --> 13:53.223
- No, Ricky. You're hurt.
- Oh, no. It was just a graze.

13:53.298 --> 13:55.391
Oh, no, honey. He's fine.

13:55.466 --> 13:57.957
Go ahead, Richard. Show some hustle.

13:58.036 --> 14:02.405
Yes, indeedy.
But I will be needing a helping hand.

14:02.473 --> 14:06.910
So what do you say, brother?
Give us a chance to bury the old hatchet.

14:09.714 --> 14:13.343
Make things right with Ricky,
or don't come off that roof.

14:23.194 --> 14:25.526
Uh, ladies first.

14:29.467 --> 14:32.402
Whoa.

14:32.470 --> 14:35.667
Whoa. Total creep show.

14:38.676 --> 14:40.837
All right. Here we go.

14:40.912 --> 14:43.472
Listen, about that paintball thing--

14:43.548 --> 14:46.949
Oh, hey. Don't even worry about it.

14:48.219 --> 14:50.449
Firecracker! Too slow.

14:50.521 --> 14:54.389
You know what? Thanks to your little,
uh, sharp shooting stunt...

14:54.459 --> 14:56.120
I racked up pity points with your parents...

14:56.194 --> 14:58.560
and big sis is just itching
to be my private nurse.

14:58.630 --> 15:03.158
So thanks a ton, ace.
That was a textbook wingman move.

15:03.234 --> 15:05.168
Come on. Quit stalling.

15:05.236 --> 15:07.932
Get your butt up there
and make me Nana's hero.

15:08.006 --> 15:10.600
But you told my dad you'd fix it.

15:10.675 --> 15:12.700
Aw, well, I told your dad a lot of things.

15:12.777 --> 15:16.440
Like my car broke down,
my parents own a lake house...

15:16.514 --> 15:18.641
I'm 18.

15:20.184 --> 15:22.675
You-You're not a senior?

15:22.754 --> 15:24.722
Not in high school.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.154
- Now go.

15:30.461 --> 15:32.520
Go.

15:32.597 --> 15:35.691
There you go.

16:20.278 --> 16:21.836
Hello?

16:32.190 --> 16:34.124
Hello?

16:39.630 --> 16:43.430
- Dude, you make it too easy.
- It's not funny.

16:43.501 --> 16:45.969
What the heck happened to the dish?

16:46.037 --> 16:48.062
I can't do a week here without TV.

16:48.139 --> 16:50.073
I can't do a week here, period.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.219
- Whoa.

17:03.287 --> 17:07.246
- Hello, hu-mans.

17:07.325 --> 17:10.886
- Please tell me you see that too.
- Not sure I want to.

17:10.962 --> 17:13.294
- But, yeah.
- We come from upstairs!

17:13.364 --> 17:16.663
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa.
I handle human contact.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.828
- Yes, sir. Noted. It's understood.
- Hello, humans.

17:19.904 --> 17:23.771
No need to notification army.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.809
- We come in pieces.
- In peace.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.310
- What?
- Say it with me. "Peace. "

17:27.377 --> 17:29.573
- What are you talking about?
- Read the book. Peace.

17:29.647 --> 17:32.275
Forget the book!
Attack the humans! Attack!

17:32.350 --> 17:36.081
- With pleasure.
- Humans, submit.

17:37.655 --> 17:40.488
- Hey, what is taking you girls so long?
- No, don't. No. No.

17:42.827 --> 17:45.625
- Ricky!

17:45.696 --> 17:49.097
- What's happening to him?
- Now the fun begins.

17:49.167 --> 17:53.399
- Testing. Testing. Testing.
- Testing. Testing. Testing.

17:53.471 --> 17:55.996
- Testing.

17:58.443 --> 18:02.470
Humanoid subjects,
we are the Zirkonian species.

18:02.547 --> 18:06.506
And we hereby claim your
luscious planet as our own.

18:06.584 --> 18:11.988
Wha- Wha...  You have
the choice of eternal enslavement or...

18:13.124 --> 18:15.024
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

18:15.093 --> 18:17.061
instantaneous death.

18:17.128 --> 18:19.187
- Run?
- I'm good with run.

18:19.263 --> 18:23.529
- You have chosen instantaneous death.

18:23.601 --> 18:25.535
The human grubs are escaping.

18:25.603 --> 18:28.037
- It's locked.
- Not from me.

18:31.943 --> 18:34.207
- We're trapped.
- Duck!

18:40.885 --> 18:43.251
- Unbelievable.

18:46.124 --> 18:48.524
- Razor, go!
- Yes, sir.

18:52.797 --> 18:56.324
- Hey, can I play too?
- Oh, Hannah, thank God. Open. Hurry.

18:58.069 --> 18:59.730
Hurry.

19:00.938 --> 19:02.997
Creepy-crawly!

19:03.074 --> 19:05.838
No, no, no, no. Come back. Come back!

19:05.910 --> 19:07.878
- Take them down!
- Look out!

19:07.945 --> 19:10.209
Hey, frog-face!

19:12.984 --> 19:15.248
What's with all the noise?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.254
- Open the window!
- Open it.

19:18.322 --> 19:20.256
- You open it.
- No, you open it.

19:20.324 --> 19:22.292
- Hurry! Get them!
- Help!

19:22.360 --> 19:24.590
Someone, open it!

19:24.662 --> 19:26.789
Come on. Right there.

19:26.864 --> 19:29.025
- Charge!
- Hurry up!

19:30.101 --> 19:32.126
Move, twin!

19:34.705 --> 19:37.139
Everybody, downstairs now!

19:37.208 --> 19:38.698
- Why?
-Just move!

19:43.447 --> 19:48.111
- Creepy-crawlies.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.552
- Creepy.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

19:50.621 --> 19:52.589
Get down! Down!

19:56.994 --> 20:00.987
- Pull! Pull! Pull!
- I am! Hurry!

20:05.236 --> 20:07.602
- Stupid remote control.
- Glorious commander, be careful.

20:07.672 --> 20:09.936
- What's wrong with it? Fix it.
- Be careful!

20:10.007 --> 20:13.272
- You a zombie?

20:13.344 --> 20:16.973
- No. You?
- No.

20:17.048 --> 20:18.675
Prove it.

20:18.749 --> 20:21.309
- What do you mean?
- I mean prove it!

20:21.385 --> 20:24.411
You-You wet the bed until you were 10.
A zombie wouldn't know that.

20:24.488 --> 20:26.615
- Here they come! Look out!
- Ugly humans, submit.

20:26.691 --> 20:30.491
Get the rope.

20:30.561 --> 20:33.189
- Tie it off!
- I'm trying. Push harder.

20:33.264 --> 20:35.323
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

20:35.399 --> 20:38.129
She scratched me with her claws!

20:38.202 --> 20:39.794
Sorry, sucker.

20:39.870 --> 20:42.339
Whoa. He cut off her nails.

20:42.406 --> 20:44.340
We gotta call 911.

20:52.116 --> 20:54.107
- I can't get a signal.
- Neither can I.

20:54.185 --> 20:57.882
Mine's dead too.

20:57.955 --> 21:00.480
- Those midget Martians must be jamming us.
- Never a good sign.

21:00.558 --> 21:03.459
- It's working!

21:05.062 --> 21:07.724
There's no buttons. What is this thing?

21:07.798 --> 21:11.461
It's a rotary phone. You spin it.

21:18.809 --> 21:21.869
What happened up there?
Was "get them" not clear enough?

21:21.946 --> 21:24.744
Someone was obviously distracted.

21:24.815 --> 21:27.079
I was following the plan.

21:27.151 --> 21:29.142
You were playing with your little toy.

21:29.220 --> 21:32.519
- This is a deadly weapon! It is.
- No. These are deadly weapons.

21:32.590 --> 21:36.822
Listen on yourselves. This is why
we lost success on our mission previous.

21:36.894 --> 21:39.692
Not looking to blame throw,
but that one was Razor's fault.

21:39.764 --> 21:44.360
What? You were the one... If we lose
success this time, I lose my command.

21:44.435 --> 21:46.426
Now, you're going to learn to work together...

21:46.504 --> 21:49.735
or we will together end up shoveling manure
back in Sector 7.

21:49.807 --> 21:51.798
We won't let you down, sir.

21:51.876 --> 21:54.310
Let's go enslave some humans!

21:54.378 --> 21:58.747
Actually, uh, about that,
I'm sure enslaving is plenty of fun.

21:58.816 --> 22:00.807
- But why the hu-mans?
- What?

22:00.885 --> 22:03.012
- They don't seem that bad.
- Aw. Rookie.

22:03.087 --> 22:05.317
Oh, "they don't seem that bad."

22:05.389 --> 22:08.916
- Funny. That's what our engineer previous said.
- Engineer previous?

22:08.993 --> 22:12.588
Right before the creature
that was "not that bad" ate him!

22:12.663 --> 22:15.131
- The humans are vicious.

22:15.199 --> 22:18.760
Peace is not an option.

22:22.206 --> 22:24.970
- Sheriff here.

22:25.042 --> 22:27.442
Uh, th-there's an alien invasion
at our rental house.

22:27.511 --> 22:31.072
- Knee-high beings. Very violent.
- Knee-high. Like a hobbit?

22:31.148 --> 22:33.241
No. Real. Look, I know this sounds crazy...

22:33.317 --> 22:36.252
- but you gotta understand--
- Okay, yeah, listen, son.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.381
You do know making a fraudulent complaint
is a federal offense. It's punishable--

22:40.458 --> 22:42.392
- Hello?

22:42.460 --> 22:44.587
- Hmm.

22:44.662 --> 22:47.756
Decent technique... for a female.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.461
- How's that technique?

22:50.534 --> 22:52.900
- Hello?

22:53.037 --> 22:55.471
- We gotta tell our parents.

23:20.598 --> 23:23.089
Think he's still an alien zombie?

23:28.172 --> 23:31.005
- You are useless.

23:31.075 --> 23:34.442
Why aren't the mind-control plugs working?
You're the engineer.

23:34.512 --> 23:36.707
Figure it out. Hurry up. Hurry up.

23:36.781 --> 23:38.772
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Fix it!

23:38.849 --> 23:41.317
- Fix it. Fix it now, you idiot.
- He's not talking to us, right?

23:41.385 --> 23:45.549
I think he's picking up their conversation.
They had, like, a Bluetooth.

23:45.623 --> 23:47.750
What do you mean their hormone levels
are too unstable?

23:47.825 --> 23:49.816
Are you telling me the plugs only work
on mature subjects?

23:49.894 --> 23:52.192
Why did we not plan for this?

23:52.263 --> 23:54.356
You have failed me, you incompetent piece of--

23:54.432 --> 23:56.992
- Deck.
- Translation not available.

23:57.067 --> 24:01.026
These humans will pay!

24:03.707 --> 24:05.971
- Did you hear that?

24:06.043 --> 24:08.068
Yeah. Sounds like Ricky landed on his face.

24:08.145 --> 24:11.876
No. Those things they shot at us,
they-re-they're mind-control plugs.

24:11.949 --> 24:15.578
They won't work on kids.
It's like you said. We're wired differently.

24:15.653 --> 24:18.087
Wha-What about Ricky?
It tagged him and he's Bethany's age.

24:18.155 --> 24:20.521
No. He lied. The tool's in college.

24:20.591 --> 24:22.525
So if their plugs don't work on kids--

24:22.593 --> 24:24.527
- That means we're safe.
- It means we can fight 'em.

24:24.595 --> 24:27.996
It means they'll go after our parents.
They're walking targets.

24:28.065 --> 24:30.090
We got to tell 'em. Now.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.533
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Think.

24:32.603 --> 24:36.164
If our parents even go near those things,
they'll get zapped and end up zombies.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.504
Our own parents will attack us.

24:38.576 --> 24:42.342
- We need the police and their hard-core firepower.
- Oh, armed zombies. Even better.

24:42.413 --> 24:47.180
We're done. Game over. Game over for the grown-ups.
But we can still fight back.

24:47.251 --> 24:50.015
So you expect us to stop
an alien invasion on our own?

24:50.087 --> 24:53.079
He's right. We're the only option.

24:53.157 --> 24:55.182
But we can't tell anyone.

24:55.259 --> 24:57.955
No police, no parents, no exceptions.

24:58.028 --> 25:00.223
- Got it?
- Hannah?

25:01.999 --> 25:04.968
They're up in the attic right now, little aliens.

25:05.035 --> 25:10.234
They're loud and scary and really mean.

25:10.307 --> 25:14.607
- Han, there's no such things as aliens.
- Yes, there is. I saw them.

25:14.678 --> 25:18.205
They smashed the skylight
and tried to break the attic stairs.

25:18.282 --> 25:22.150
Well, let's hope not for your sake.
We put a huge deposit on this place.

25:22.219 --> 25:24.483
So you boys better keep it in one piece.

25:24.555 --> 25:26.887
- You heard her, Tom. No more trouble.
- It was just a video game.

25:26.957 --> 25:30.552
- We shouldn't have let her watch. It's rated "T" for "Teen".  
- It's teen violence.

25:30.628 --> 25:34.462
Tommy, I'm scared.
I don't like the mean aliens.

25:34.532 --> 25:39.560
Don't worry, Han. Just pretend it's a big game,
a game that we're gonna win.

25:39.637 --> 25:43.232
-Just think about how little they are.
- Little and deadly.

25:43.307 --> 25:46.140
- What do we do now?
- We figure out their weakness.

25:46.210 --> 25:49.338
They flew here from another galaxy.
You really think they have a weakness?

25:49.413 --> 25:52.541
First rule of the warrior code--

25:52.616 --> 25:54.607
All enemies have a weakness.

25:54.685 --> 25:58.348
Sparks, why isn't my locator map
up and running?

25:58.422 --> 26:01.414
I told you. I need parts to repair it.
You're not helping--

26:06.564 --> 26:10.261
- Aha! Even on Earth, the male is dominant.
- Ah.

26:10.334 --> 26:12.768
Aha. Oh.

26:12.836 --> 26:15.828
- Wait.
- Ah. But the female always wins.

26:15.906 --> 26:18.033
What the--

26:18.108 --> 26:21.475
By the rings of Zirkon.

26:21.545 --> 26:23.775
Huh? That makes no sense.

26:23.847 --> 26:27.305
They were fighting.
Now their lips are hugging?

26:27.384 --> 26:29.318
- I would never.
- Never.

26:29.386 --> 26:31.684
- Ne-ver.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

26:31.755 --> 26:34.588
Can I get you anything?
A cold drink? Some snacks? Hmm?

26:34.658 --> 26:38.219
- Or would you rather help me invade a planet?

26:40.297 --> 26:43.858
All right, recon's my specialty.
I'm going up.

26:50.941 --> 26:54.900
- I'm coming with you.
- Tom, be careful.

26:58.682 --> 27:01.708
- Enemy... apprehended.

27:01.785 --> 27:05.812
- I'll interrogate.
- Ah!

27:11.662 --> 27:14.825
- Ah. Disgusting.
- What? Seriously, what?

27:14.898 --> 27:16.832
Locator activated, sir.

27:16.900 --> 27:19.300
Excellent. Target the objective.

27:19.370 --> 27:22.168
Zoom in. Zoom.

27:22.239 --> 27:26.266
Zoom. Zoom, zoom, zoom.

27:26.343 --> 27:31.440
- You don't have to keep saying "zoom. "
- Zoom. Zoom.

27:31.515 --> 27:33.449
And... rotate.

27:33.517 --> 27:36.008
I think they're after
something in the house.

27:36.086 --> 27:38.281
- Let me get a better look.
- Stop.

27:38.355 --> 27:43.190
- Rotate. Ah. The basement.

27:43.260 --> 27:46.024
- Tom, help me!
- Ah.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.997
- That must have hurt.

27:53.070 --> 27:55.732
Basement. We gotta get to the basement.

27:55.806 --> 27:57.706
Ricky?

27:57.775 --> 27:59.709
Ricky!

27:59.777 --> 28:03.269
Oh. Hey, guys, wait.
Have you guys seen Ricky?

28:03.347 --> 28:06.612
Uh, pretty sure he's still
hanging around here somewhere.

28:06.684 --> 28:09.118
- Actually, Beth, uh--
- He didn't leave, did he?

28:09.186 --> 28:12.314
No, no. He, um--
He told us he was heading back to the lake...

28:12.389 --> 28:15.290
uh, to, bronze up his rock-hard abs.

28:15.359 --> 28:17.554
- Yeah, he wants you to meet him there.
- Wait.

28:17.628 --> 28:20.256
What did you guys talk about on the roof?

28:20.330 --> 28:22.264
Did he say anything about me?

28:22.332 --> 28:25.324
No. No, no. He-- He talked about his car.

28:25.402 --> 28:29.236
And, um--
But pre-pretty much just his car.

28:29.306 --> 28:31.604
Um, but you should hit the lake so
he doesn't think you're blowing him off.

28:31.675 --> 28:34.667
- Yeah, the lake.
- Over there. It's probably good there.

28:38.782 --> 28:42.343
- I'm telling you, their map led down here.
- You positive?

28:42.419 --> 28:45.946
Shh. You hear that? Rice Krispies.

28:59.169 --> 29:01.933
- What is that?

29:06.009 --> 29:08.102
It's them.

29:10.948 --> 29:12.939
Something down here's setting it off.

29:24.294 --> 29:27.786
Well, whatever it is,
we can't let 'em get to it.

29:27.865 --> 29:30.356
Everyone, gear up. We move on my command.

29:30.434 --> 29:32.527
Now, just hold on.

29:32.603 --> 29:36.630
If we run up there with a bunch
of random junk, we're gonna get creamed.

29:36.707 --> 29:39.039
We can make something better.

29:39.109 --> 29:41.304
We're in the middle of a battle,
and you wanna play science fair?

29:41.378 --> 29:44.541
No way. We're going back in now...

29:44.615 --> 29:47.049
before our parents end up as alien zombies.

29:47.117 --> 29:49.483
You're not thinking. We need a plan.

29:49.553 --> 29:52.386
- I already have a great idea for a weapon.
- Really?

29:52.456 --> 29:54.822
Let's go.

29:54.892 --> 29:56.883
Now.

30:03.901 --> 30:05.562
Hannah, hand me that tape.

30:06.637 --> 30:08.571
- What's up, Nate?
- Hey, guys!

30:08.639 --> 30:10.573
- Hey, Nana!
- Who wants a treat?

30:10.641 --> 30:15.544
Whoo.
That's a lot of tools to try to fix the TV.

30:28.692 --> 30:31.525
They're busting through.
The warrior code says strike first.

30:31.595 --> 30:34.860
- Art, cover me.
- With the rake?

30:44.374 --> 30:47.969
How do you feel now? Suckers!

30:48.979 --> 30:51.072
Mission accomplished.

30:56.019 --> 30:58.715
Oh, God.

30:58.789 --> 31:00.051
- Oh--
- Crud.

31:02.326 --> 31:05.318
It's a dud.

31:07.364 --> 31:10.162
What the-- Whoa!

31:10.234 --> 31:12.395
- Whoa! What's happening?
- Why are we floating?

31:12.469 --> 31:15.597
They turned off the gravity,
like in Halo.

31:15.672 --> 31:19.768
This isn't Xbox, Lee.
It's real. Like Wii.

31:19.843 --> 31:23.745
- Now what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

31:23.814 --> 31:26.840
Stay behind me.

31:26.917 --> 31:30.318
- No! Don't! Don't!
- [Lee] There's no gravity.

31:34.691 --> 31:37.353
Hello, hu-mans.

31:37.427 --> 31:40.123
Enjoying the ride?

31:43.200 --> 31:45.134
They have gravity boots.

31:45.202 --> 31:47.830
- Why don't we have gravity boots?
- "They have gravity boots."

31:47.905 --> 31:51.204
The door! Stop 'em! Use your weapon, Tom!

31:51.275 --> 31:53.470
- Bring it, meat sack.
- Today!

31:55.545 --> 31:59.208
A potato gun? That's your big idea?

31:59.283 --> 32:03.117
- My plan is working.
- My plan. You mean my plan.

32:05.122 --> 32:07.056
Hurry, Tommy!

32:12.496 --> 32:14.555
Oh!

32:24.741 --> 32:26.072
- Ooh.

32:26.143 --> 32:29.635
- You okay?
- I'm fine. The door.

32:29.713 --> 32:31.647
On it.

32:31.715 --> 32:33.842
Jake, get the grenade!

32:36.553 --> 32:38.987
- Ah.
- Hurry!

32:42.726 --> 32:45.217
Quick! Toss it here!

32:48.465 --> 32:50.990
- What?
- Oh!

32:52.135 --> 32:55.764
Sock Monkey.

32:55.839 --> 32:58.330
Oh! Ha!

32:58.408 --> 33:00.433
You little--

33:00.510 --> 33:02.171
Quick! Get 'em!

33:02.245 --> 33:03.769
- Go!

33:03.847 --> 33:06.680
- Shoot him! Shoot him!
- Go, go, go!

33:06.817 --> 33:10.048
- Shoot him!
- Ouch! Ow! Ouch again!

33:10.120 --> 33:12.611
- Buttocks on fire!

33:14.124 --> 33:17.116
Whoa.
That's the thing they used to control Ricky.

33:17.194 --> 33:20.186
- Whoa!

33:20.263 --> 33:23.630
Oh, cool. Let me see it.
Oh, nice action on the toggles.

33:25.535 --> 33:28.629
Wait. What are these?
Give it back. Let me see.

33:28.705 --> 33:31.936
- I picked it up first.
- Give it back.

33:32.009 --> 33:34.409
- It's mine.
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. This is not a toy. It's real.

33:41.451 --> 33:43.612
- Ricky?
- Yep.

33:43.687 --> 33:45.780
Get him before somebody finds him.
I'll stand alien watch.

33:57.267 --> 33:59.895
- I'm sure that'll buff right out.

33:59.970 --> 34:02.268
Wonder where he went.

34:02.339 --> 34:05.172
- Oh, I'll find him.

34:07.844 --> 34:09.505
Whoa.

34:15.719 --> 34:21.179
Cool. So these move him.
And these... operate the arms.

34:26.063 --> 34:29.829
- Talk about the ultimate Game Boy.

34:31.701 --> 34:35.330
- What does that big button do?

34:40.444 --> 34:43.880
Whoa! What the--

34:43.947 --> 34:46.848
- My car!

34:46.917 --> 34:50.284
That would be the on-and-off button.

34:50.353 --> 34:52.821
- Press it again.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.719
Car!

34:54.791 --> 34:59.387
- Who did this to my car?
- You did, you giant idiot.

34:59.463 --> 35:01.055
Ricky!

35:03.533 --> 35:05.296
- Where have you been?

35:05.368 --> 35:08.462
Oh, shut up, you little b-- Bethany.

35:08.538 --> 35:10.836
- What?
- Ah!

35:10.907 --> 35:14.172
- Why are you hitting me?
- Why are you being such a jerk?

35:14.244 --> 35:16.678
- Huh?
- Revenge is so sweet.

35:16.746 --> 35:19.476
I just spent the last hour
walking around the lake. Where were you?

35:19.549 --> 35:22.985
- Uh-- I--
- That's what I thought.

35:23.053 --> 35:25.453
- No. I-I don't know.

35:25.522 --> 35:27.513
- Want me to bring him back?
- Babe, please don't be mad at me.

35:27.591 --> 35:30.059
- Did your brain fall out of your head?
- Let him suffer.

35:40.637 --> 35:44.038
Where's Ricky?
Taken prisoner by the aliens?

35:44.107 --> 35:47.543
No. Worse. My sister.

35:48.845 --> 35:51.075
Any action up here?

35:51.148 --> 35:54.584
It's been quiet. Too quiet.

35:54.651 --> 35:58.519
No talking in here. Got it?

36:01.324 --> 36:03.519
What are they doing in the vents?

36:03.593 --> 36:07.586
- Their map. That's how they'll get to the basement.
- What do we do?

36:13.803 --> 36:15.794
I hope this works, Einstein.

36:15.872 --> 36:19.865
I didn't get to thank you
for pulling me to safety back there...

36:19.943 --> 36:21.911
because I didn't need you to.

36:21.978 --> 36:24.378
- Uh, that doesn't make sense.
- I don't like you.

36:24.447 --> 36:26.438
- Shh. Stop talking.
- Good to know. Okay.

36:29.553 --> 36:32.021
Hmm?

36:32.088 --> 36:34.318
Hmm. Sweating?

36:36.193 --> 36:38.252
Hot! Ah!

36:38.328 --> 36:41.092
Hot! Hot! Hotter! Run!

36:43.300 --> 36:46.167
Fall back! Fall back! Ouch! Ouch!

36:48.238 --> 36:50.297
- Sounds like they're mad.

36:50.373 --> 36:52.933
Nice job. I think it's working.

36:53.009 --> 36:55.068
Kids, get down here right now!

36:58.148 --> 37:00.173
Who turned on the heat?

37:00.250 --> 37:02.343
I did. Um, we need that on.

37:02.419 --> 37:04.319
Are you crazy? It's July.

37:04.387 --> 37:07.413
- Yeah, but it's-- it's freezing in here.
- Ooh, yeah. Ooh, Arctic.

37:07.490 --> 37:09.822
Yeah. I think Hannah's
coming down with something.

37:12.229 --> 37:14.197
What's going on?

37:14.264 --> 37:18.030
We're fighting aliens.
I'm pretending it's pretend.

37:18.101 --> 37:20.433
I mean, it is pretend.

37:20.503 --> 37:24.701
Okay, but I'm not pretending,
so don't touch the thermostat.

37:24.774 --> 37:27.766
- Tom, I'm not playing around.
- Neither am I.

37:27.844 --> 37:30.972
Tom, I'm not kidding. You wanna spend
the rest of the week in your room?

37:31.047 --> 37:33.140
Why can't you at least trust
there's a reason I'm doing this?

37:33.216 --> 37:35.707
A reason why you're blasting the furnace
on summer vacation?

37:35.785 --> 37:37.616
Yes. A reason why you
shot your sister's boyfriend?

37:37.687 --> 37:40.520
Yes. A reason why you're
talking back, giving me attitude?

37:40.590 --> 37:44.549
- Failing your classes?
- So that's what this is about?

37:46.229 --> 37:48.527
I failed them on purpose.

37:48.598 --> 37:50.623
Yeah, I tanked my grades, okay?

37:50.700 --> 37:52.725
I'm tired of getting picked on
because I'm a brainiac.

37:52.802 --> 37:54.736
I was a brainiac. It worked for me.

37:54.804 --> 37:58.331
I don't wanna be like you. I wanna be cool.

38:03.813 --> 38:06.611
Don't touch the thermostat.

38:09.919 --> 38:13.719
Is that true?
You really fail on purpose?

38:13.790 --> 38:16.350
Nobody likes a mathlete.

38:16.426 --> 38:18.894
Man, we can't fight these things
with our parents around.

38:18.962 --> 38:21.328
We can't just get rid of 'em.

38:21.398 --> 38:25.357
Maybe we can. Here's what I want you to do.

38:31.041 --> 38:33.339
Send it.

38:34.878 --> 38:38.746
- I hate it when we fight.
- Aw, I can't fight someone as cute as you.

38:38.815 --> 38:40.715
Well, I'm glad we made up.

38:40.784 --> 38:43.617
Well, it's not an official make-up
without the make-up kiss.

38:43.687 --> 38:47.214
- Easy. My family's up there.
- And your family's crazy about me.

38:47.290 --> 38:49.918
- What about you?
- Well, you know I like you.

38:49.993 --> 38:52.359
And we have the whole summer
ahead of us.

38:52.429 --> 38:55.057
Maybe we don't have to go so fast.

38:55.131 --> 38:57.258
What? What?

39:04.107 --> 39:06.041
Is that a "no"?

39:06.109 --> 39:07.599
Ricky!

39:09.612 --> 39:11.842
Ricky!

39:13.650 --> 39:16.210
- Careful. Don't break him.
- Ricky!

39:16.286 --> 39:18.811
- Better grab his shirt.
- Ricky!

39:21.391 --> 39:23.382
Still no sign of 'em.

39:26.963 --> 39:30.262
- Where are they?
- 2 options.

39:30.333 --> 39:33.962
We're dealing with a retreat
or a surprise attack.

39:41.311 --> 39:43.939
- Surprise attack.

39:50.086 --> 39:53.021
Hey, where's Tom?
I thought he was gonna help you.

39:53.089 --> 39:55.819
- So did I.
- Bad news.

39:55.892 --> 39:58.190
The leasing office called.

39:58.261 --> 40:01.321
They need you to go back there
before they close for the holidays.

40:01.398 --> 40:04.367
- Really?
- Problem with the contract.

40:04.434 --> 40:06.766
They insisted.

40:06.836 --> 40:09.100
Ricky, are you okay?

40:09.172 --> 40:11.766
Oh, um-- Um--

40:11.841 --> 40:14.435
-Just allergies, Mr. P.
-Just allergies, Mr. P.

40:14.511 --> 40:17.173
But they did say it's urgent.

40:17.247 --> 40:20.683
- Urgent?
- Okay, I'll call and I'll sort this out.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.548
That's so weird.

40:26.189 --> 40:30.455
Oh, this is weird, Stu.
I think the phone's dead.

40:33.096 --> 40:35.189
Did they just cut off our power?

40:35.265 --> 40:37.665
Oh, they are gonna hear about it from me.

40:37.734 --> 40:40.703
Let's go.
We are going down there right now.

40:40.770 --> 40:43.238
Hey, guys, uh,
we can use some more beer, some chips.

40:43.306 --> 40:45.968
Why don't you run to the grocery store?
I'll fire up the grill.

40:46.042 --> 40:49.034
- And watch the kids?
- Okay, whatever.

40:49.112 --> 40:51.410
- No.
- No.

40:51.481 --> 40:54.746
I mean, you all have to go.

40:54.818 --> 40:58.015
- They said all your names are on the lease.

40:59.589 --> 41:01.887
- I'll look after the kids.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.

41:01.958 --> 41:04.586
- No. That'd be--
- Well, I-- I guess I could drive.

41:04.661 --> 41:06.686
Oh. Um-- Okay.

41:06.763 --> 41:09.391
- Okay.
- Oh, and, Mr. P...

41:09.466 --> 41:12.435
while you're out,
can you get me some adult diapers?

41:12.502 --> 41:15.027
- Mine are almost full.
- Mine are almost full.

41:16.940 --> 41:19.875
- That is a bad allergy.
- Oof.

41:19.943 --> 41:22.002
Super absorbent.

41:24.447 --> 41:28.440
Look. Alien death mist. Don't breathe.

41:28.518 --> 41:31.248
- Put him on "pause."

41:35.225 --> 41:38.160
Happy 4th of July, space maggots.

41:38.228 --> 41:40.196
Jake, there's smoke in the vents.

41:40.263 --> 41:43.232
It's me. We have unfriendlies on the move.
I tracked them down and held 'em off.

41:43.299 --> 41:44.698
- Nice.
- Parents?

41:44.767 --> 41:46.860
- Gone.
- Nice.

41:46.936 --> 41:48.927
Now we can take it up a notch.

41:54.944 --> 41:57.879
This could get ugly. Hannah, go hide.

41:57.947 --> 42:01.644
- Yeah. Seek safety.
- Not you.

42:04.954 --> 42:06.888
Incoming! Duck!

42:08.958 --> 42:10.926
Sayonara, suckers!

42:12.362 --> 42:14.455
- Oh--
- Crud.

42:18.434 --> 42:21.733
- My arm! My head!
- They got me!

42:21.871 --> 42:26.001
Go, go, go, go!

42:26.075 --> 42:30.444
I'm starting to see why the last engineer--

42:55.204 --> 42:57.695
I see you've booby-trapped your room.

42:57.774 --> 43:00.106
Got it. Got it. Ooh! Don't got it!

43:01.344 --> 43:05.041
Ingenious human snare.

43:09.919 --> 43:12.353
Ow.

43:15.959 --> 43:20.328
Oh, wow. I thought I was clumsy.

43:23.366 --> 43:26.062
- It's okay. Don't worry.
- I come in peace.

43:26.135 --> 43:28.933
It's okay. I'll help you.

43:31.874 --> 43:34.138
Don't worry. Trust me. It's okay.

43:36.546 --> 43:38.707
- Oh. Ow.
- Oh.

43:38.781 --> 43:40.908
You've got a boo-boo. Don't move.

43:47.991 --> 43:49.481
Oh.

43:49.559 --> 43:52.153
- Okay?
- Thank you.

43:53.763 --> 43:56.197
Tazer. Razor.

43:56.265 --> 43:59.132
Sparks. Sparks!

43:59.202 --> 44:02.501
He's critical to mission.

44:05.908 --> 44:08.468
- Nice sounds.
- It's music.

44:08.544 --> 44:12.241
Ooh, music. I try?

44:12.315 --> 44:14.749
Sure.

44:33.603 --> 44:35.264
Yeah!

44:40.109 --> 44:44.773
We've definitely slowed 'em down,
but those buggers adapt fast.

44:44.847 --> 44:47.645
We need to pull out the big guns.

44:49.619 --> 44:52.213
Black Cat Whistler or Fire Dragon?

44:53.623 --> 44:56.490
How about not burning down the house?

45:04.534 --> 45:06.593
He's armed! Enemy armed!

45:06.669 --> 45:09.263
Hannah, step away from the alien.

45:11.507 --> 45:14.806
No! Leave him alone! He's my friend.

45:14.877 --> 45:17.141
He was just holding a ray gun to your head.

45:17.213 --> 45:19.579
It's my bubble blower. He fixed it for me.

45:19.649 --> 45:23.346
He's not like the others. Look.

45:24.520 --> 45:27.284
First sign of aggression, I'm taking him out...

45:27.356 --> 45:28.948
with extreme prejudice.

45:29.025 --> 45:31.823
I don't have training for this.
No training.

45:31.894 --> 45:35.022
- It's okay, Mr. Snuggle Lump.
- Snuggle Lump?

45:35.098 --> 45:38.033
- Yeah, that's what I named him.
- My name Sparks.

45:38.101 --> 45:41.628
He's not your pet, Hannah.
He's a freakin' alien.

45:41.704 --> 45:44.172
He's my alien.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.606
Hi.

45:46.676 --> 45:48.303
Aw.

45:50.012 --> 45:52.173
I mean--

45:52.248 --> 45:53.840
Maybe she's right.

45:53.916 --> 45:57.682
I mean, look at his belt.
I think those are tools.

45:57.754 --> 46:02.453
Hey, it's okay, buddy.
We just want to talk to you.

46:02.525 --> 46:05.016
Come on, Snugs.

46:05.094 --> 46:06.891
Back up.

46:16.939 --> 46:19.499
Uh-- Oh.

46:24.313 --> 46:26.747
Watch.

46:33.723 --> 46:36.248
- Awesome.
- How does he do that?

46:55.845 --> 46:57.574
What the heck was that?

46:57.647 --> 47:00.377
Talking about feelings comes with the
territory when you have a girl friend.

47:00.449 --> 47:03.680
There is no loop hole for that one!

47:03.753 --> 47:05.744
Okay. Okay, I get it.

47:05.822 --> 47:10.088
You're not gonna talk when I'm yelling.
I'm sorry. It's not mature of me to shout.

47:11.894 --> 47:17.389
Look, I am so, so happy
being your girlfriend.

47:17.466 --> 47:21.129
But if you really care about me
the way that I care about you...

47:21.204 --> 47:24.264
then it shouldn't be a problem
to give me the time that I need.

47:26.175 --> 47:28.268
Maybe you need to think about it.

47:28.344 --> 47:33.281
And I can respect that. Okay?
Take all the time that you want.

47:33.349 --> 47:37.285
I'll be here, ready to talk.

47:40.431 --> 47:42.365
With you.

47:47.805 --> 47:49.739
So-So that's how it is?

47:49.807 --> 47:53.868
I'm getting the silent treatment?
Who is in high school now?

47:58.449 --> 48:01.043
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Why are you trying to kill us?

48:01.119 --> 48:03.553
- What's the invasion plan?
- What's your weakness?

48:03.621 --> 48:04.986
- Water?
- Earth germs?

48:05.056 --> 48:06.921
- Women?
- Are there more of you coming?

48:06.991 --> 48:09.152
- We need the information.
- I--

48:09.227 --> 48:11.127
Guys, don't be mean.

48:11.195 --> 48:13.095
Han, we have to interrogate him.

48:13.164 --> 48:15.564
Do you want the world to end? Do ya?

48:16.734 --> 48:18.565
No.

48:24.008 --> 48:25.805
Whoa.

48:25.877 --> 48:28.243
House here. Mission objective here.

48:28.312 --> 48:32.442
What you're after isn't in the basement.
It's under the basement.

48:32.517 --> 48:34.747
- Yes.
- What are you trying to steal from our planet?

48:34.819 --> 48:37.982
Who says it's from our planet?
Look at that thing. It looks alien to me.

48:38.056 --> 48:40.183
It must be from their planet.

48:40.258 --> 48:43.250
- Mmm. 
- Yeah. Planet Fruitcake.

48:43.327 --> 48:46.296
Whatever it is, it's huge.

48:53.304 --> 48:55.295
Almost done.

48:57.408 --> 48:59.603
- So, that's what's in the capsule?
- Ah.

48:59.677 --> 49:02.840
Some kind of giant machine?

49:02.914 --> 49:05.405
Oh, great. A giant alien death machine.

49:05.483 --> 49:08.680
- No one said anything about death.
- I doubt it's a photocopier.

49:08.753 --> 49:12.189
Come on! We can't trust this 4-armed freak.
He's one of them.

49:12.256 --> 49:14.554
He's not.

49:15.693 --> 49:18.685
This guy doesn't fit in with the others.

49:22.233 --> 49:25.669
He's... different.

49:25.737 --> 49:28.399
- Mmm.
- Great. A geek alien.

49:28.473 --> 49:31.499
Jake, he's not a geek.

49:31.576 --> 49:34.044
It's better than a killer alien.

49:51.662 --> 49:54.062
Mm-hmm.

49:57.769 --> 50:01.170
Buenas noches, wrinkles.

50:06.644 --> 50:09.238
Oh, this is ridiculous.

50:13.284 --> 50:15.718
Well, this sucks.

50:21.359 --> 50:24.123
- Modified.
- Whoa.

50:26.264 --> 50:27.697
Sweet.

50:28.933 --> 50:31.265
- Sweet.

50:33.805 --> 50:35.636
Sorry. Huh?

50:38.810 --> 50:41.540
- It's the po-po. Be cool.
- Be cool?

50:41.612 --> 50:42.943
Open up!

50:43.014 --> 50:45.574
Oh, crap. We forgot about Nana.

50:45.650 --> 50:48.448
- Open the door!
- Hold on. Hannah, quick. Hide your alien.

50:48.519 --> 50:50.612
- Open the door now!
- Snugs.

50:50.688 --> 50:53.054
Get in!

50:53.124 --> 50:54.989
Hold on a second.

50:55.059 --> 50:58.756
Children of my children, I request entry.

50:58.830 --> 51:01.355
I have candied sweets.

51:01.432 --> 51:03.992
Don't open it. That's not Nana.

51:04.068 --> 51:06.696
Are you sure?

51:10.007 --> 51:13.408
Yeah, I'm sure.

51:13.477 --> 51:17.777
Surrender Engineer Sparks now.

51:17.849 --> 51:20.477
- Nana-- Nana--
- Out of my way, Earth children!

51:20.551 --> 51:22.678
- Move!
- Nana, don't make me hurt you.

51:22.753 --> 51:24.584
Nana, uh--

51:29.827 --> 51:31.761
Ew!

51:31.829 --> 51:33.922
Return him to me.

51:33.998 --> 51:37.434
Tom, do something!

51:45.109 --> 51:48.272
Ew. Gross. Human

51:50.615 --> 51:52.139
Someone's gotta get the door.

51:52.216 --> 51:55.515
- We can't let the cops in here. It's too dangerous. 
- Here's Nana!

51:55.586 --> 51:58.646
- Hey! Leave my Nana alone!
- Silence, squeaky-voiced human child!

52:01.092 --> 52:03.026
I got Nana's controller!

52:04.228 --> 52:06.560
Free me! Free me, or face the consequence!

52:06.631 --> 52:10.965
- In here.
- You don't trap me! I trap you! Why, you--

52:12.770 --> 52:15.170
- Shake all you want. We own you.

52:16.574 --> 52:19.543
The suitcase! Go!

52:23.447 --> 52:25.005
Ha! You missed me.

52:25.082 --> 52:27.812
- Stand still, Earth burgers!

52:27.885 --> 52:29.546
Ha! Got him!

52:29.620 --> 52:32.316
Don't let 'em take Snuggle Lump!

52:32.390 --> 52:34.415
Art, wait!

52:34.492 --> 52:37.154
- Shoot him! Shoot the humans!
- Incoming!

52:37.228 --> 52:40.425
- Shoot 'em up!
- Hit the deck!

52:41.599 --> 52:45.091
- You lose.
- Zirkon forever!

52:47.438 --> 52:50.236
I'm sorry, Hannah. I'm sorry. They got him.

52:51.075 --> 52:53.771
- Sweet, huh?
- Very nice.

52:53.844 --> 52:56.244
This is the Creek Landing
Sheriff's Department.

52:56.314 --> 53:00.114
Open this door at once,
or I will begin forcible entry...

53:00.184 --> 53:02.118
in 10, 9...

53:02.186 --> 53:05.587
- 8, 7, 6... You guys get rid of the cop.
I'm going after the aliens.

53:05.656 --> 53:07.851
5, 4--

53:07.925 --> 53:10.894
- We can't leave him up here.
- 2, 1.

53:10.962 --> 53:14.489
I don't know how much you kids
know about penal codes...

53:14.565 --> 53:18.057
but making phone calls with the intent
to annoy or harass is a serious offense.

53:18.135 --> 53:21.935
It's called criminal mischief.
And it could mean 6 months in jail.

53:22.006 --> 53:24.998
911 is for emergency calls only.

53:25.076 --> 53:29.103
- Any misuse of this system compromises this county's... 
- Oh, weapons.

53:29.180 --> 53:32.377
only line of defense, and that's me.

53:32.450 --> 53:34.577
Around here, I am the law.

53:34.652 --> 53:38.144
Literally, I'm the only one.
My deputy's on maternity leave.

53:38.222 --> 53:41.487
Look, Sheriff, we told you we're sorry.
It won't happen again.

53:41.559 --> 53:43.493
So, really, you can leave now.
We'll be good.

53:43.561 --> 53:46.997
Oh, I can leave?
Okay, we got the whole problem solved.

53:50.201 --> 53:52.431
- Hey, what's that there?

53:52.503 --> 53:55.495
Squadron, come in. Come in.
Do you have Sparks?

53:55.573 --> 53:59.009
- No. - Is there any job
you two can't screw up?

53:59.076 --> 54:01.840
- Come in!

54:01.912 --> 54:04.346
I'm sorry. I apologize. That was uncalled for.

54:04.415 --> 54:08.283
- You're still trapped in that box, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

54:08.352 --> 54:11.412
- Step aside, young man.
- No need for that.

54:11.489 --> 54:16.085
It's just my sister's robot dog.
It's sound activated. Right, Han?

54:16.160 --> 54:18.822
Right. It's not an alien.

54:18.896 --> 54:21.091
Mm-hmm.

54:21.165 --> 54:25.158
You know what? I'm gonna take a look
inside that chest, so please step aside.

54:36.947 --> 54:40.610
It's the po-po. Be cool.

54:42.219 --> 54:45.279
One hour. We're gone one hour.
What happened? What'd you kids do?

54:45.356 --> 54:47.790
Hi. Nina Pearson. Are you kids okay?

54:47.858 --> 54:50.122
- Is everything okay?
- No, ma'am.

54:50.194 --> 54:54.961
I'd say making a fraudulent call to 911 about
an alien invasion is most definitely not okay.

54:55.032 --> 54:57.227
- You called 911?
- Come on, buddy.

54:57.301 --> 55:01.067
I'm sure you can let these kids off
with a warning. Look at 'em.

55:01.138 --> 55:03.572
1, not your buddy.

55:03.641 --> 55:07.202
2, notice that your vehicle
is missing a front license plate.

55:07.278 --> 55:10.543
- 3, how about I write you up a ticket?
- How about you don't?

55:10.614 --> 55:12.673
Nate, stop talking.

55:12.750 --> 55:15.776
You people usually leave your
children unsupervised like this?

55:15.853 --> 55:18.913
No. No, not at all.
We had to go into town to the leasing office.

55:18.989 --> 55:21.014
They shut our power off.

55:21.092 --> 55:23.356
Looks all right to me.

55:23.427 --> 55:26.453
Sheriff, I know this isn't
something to be taken lightly...

55:26.530 --> 55:28.589
but honestly, they are really good kids.

55:28.666 --> 55:31.829
Why don't you stay and see for yourself?
We're barbecuing.

55:31.902 --> 55:34.200
-Join us.
- Mom--

55:34.271 --> 55:36.501
Thank you, ma'am.
I'd like to, but I am on duty.

55:36.574 --> 55:40.874
Look. The kids made a big mistake.
And I assure you, Tom will be punished.

55:40.945 --> 55:43.880
But my wife is right. We got plenty
of great food. Why don't you stick around?

55:43.948 --> 55:47.543
I know you`¦re on the job, but there's no law
against a home-cooked meal.

55:47.618 --> 55:52.385
Got lots of hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks and--

55:52.456 --> 55:54.481
Hmm.

55:56.160 --> 55:57.821
Okay.

56:02.533 --> 56:04.398
I have to admit, it has been a while.

56:04.468 --> 56:06.800
- All right. Arm successfully twisted.
- Great.

56:06.871 --> 56:09.533
I guess an hour off won't kill anyone.

56:09.607 --> 56:11.768
- No.

56:11.842 --> 56:14.106
Gotcha.

56:14.178 --> 56:15.873
- Hey!
- Huh?

56:15.946 --> 56:18.312
Oh.

56:18.382 --> 56:20.282
What was that?

56:20.351 --> 56:22.819
- What was what?
- I don't know. I felt something.

56:22.887 --> 56:24.821
- Come on, everyone. Dinner.
- Let me help you with the bags.

56:24.889 --> 56:26.789
Inside. I've got the desserts.

56:32.363 --> 56:34.831
- You're going down, punk!
- You're going down, punk.

56:34.899 --> 56:36.833
- I just said that.
- I just said that.

56:36.901 --> 56:39.927
- Stop that.
- Stop that.

56:43.707 --> 56:45.607
- You've been punked.

56:48.312 --> 56:50.780
- Hail Zirkonia.
- Ow!

56:55.553 --> 56:59.512
Okay, now hold on, Mom.
I'm not following. Now, what happened?

56:59.590 --> 57:01.785
One moment I'm cleaning my chompers...

57:01.859 --> 57:05.056
and then the next thing
you know, I'm down here.

57:05.129 --> 57:07.996
You know, you're entitled
to a few senior moments at your age.

57:08.065 --> 57:10.363
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forgot.
Did you want cheese on your burger?

57:10.434 --> 57:14.871
No. I want to find whoever invented love
and hack him apart with a machete.

57:17.808 --> 57:20.606
- Boy trouble.
- That makes 2 of us.

57:20.678 --> 57:25.547
- I don't know what to do about this Tom situation.
- We have a guest. Happy face.

57:25.616 --> 57:28.983
- Hey, Nate, where's Jake?
- I have no idea.

57:29.053 --> 57:31.783
Well, dinner's almost ready.
How about you track him down?

57:31.855 --> 57:35.723
Jake's an adult.
If he wants to eat, he'll come down and get it.

57:35.793 --> 57:38.557
- Oh, sorry.
- That will raise welts.

57:38.629 --> 57:42.531
- Excuse us.
- No. Pardon me. Oops. Watch your head.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.329
Mmm-mmm-mm.

57:44.401 --> 57:47.131
I tell you, there's nothing more American
than a charred chunk of meat...

57:47.204 --> 57:49.138
hittin' your stomach.

57:49.206 --> 57:51.140
- I bought the pickles.
- Oh, really?

57:51.208 --> 57:55.167
If you think a dill spear is gonna get you
out of that ticket, it's a no-go, mister.

58:04.288 --> 58:06.552
Uh--

58:07.758 --> 58:09.692
My stomach. I'm starving.

58:09.760 --> 58:12.752
- Any word from Jake?
- Still no signal.

58:12.830 --> 58:14.991
- Where is he?
- Hey, boys. None of that at the table.

58:15.065 --> 58:18.728
Right, Nate?
They're playing with their phones.

58:18.802 --> 58:21.396
Oh, yeah. Slap it on.

58:25.342 --> 58:29.108
Hey, Hannah, did you eat all the hot dogs?

58:29.179 --> 58:31.340
- No.

58:31.415 --> 58:33.542
I mean, yes.

58:35.419 --> 58:39.355
Gotta tell ya, this sure beats
eating ramen noodles in my squad car...

58:39.423 --> 58:42.187
Everyday by myself

58:43.827 --> 58:46.125
Comfortable up there, Earth boy?

58:46.196 --> 58:48.596
- Hope so.
- Enjoy some dirt in your face.

58:48.666 --> 58:50.861
Help!

58:53.170 --> 58:55.934
Attention, all.
Resistance is futile. Give me what I need.

58:56.006 --> 58:58.770
Oh, baby. I knew you'd come back.

58:58.842 --> 59:00.742
Step aside, hormonal female.

59:00.811 --> 59:03.109
Wait. You're calling me hormonal?

59:03.180 --> 59:06.206
Back away.
You are irrelevant to my mission.

59:06.283 --> 59:07.944
Irrelevant?

59:08.018 --> 59:11.317
I don't care how old you are.
You can't talk to me like that!

59:11.388 --> 59:13.754
What is going on?

59:13.824 --> 59:15.416
Teen drama. I-I think.

59:15.492 --> 59:17.824
It is teen drama, right, Ricky?

59:17.895 --> 59:19.760
- Snuggles!
- Turn him off.

59:19.830 --> 59:22.560
- It's not me.
- Snuggles!

59:22.633 --> 59:25.761
- Let's move. Bring Nana.
- Whoa, whoa. Freeze.

59:27.538 --> 59:30.735
You kids have not been excused.

59:30.808 --> 59:33.140
Let them go!

59:33.210 --> 59:37.909
We're playin' a game, Uncle Stu-- I mean, Stu.

59:37.981 --> 59:42.008
We're on vacation. Am I aging backwards?

59:42.086 --> 59:46.648
Yeah, I don't think so. You really want
to deny me my time with the kids?

59:46.724 --> 59:50.319
Wow. Guilt never gets old. Well, go ahead.

59:54.098 --> 59:57.761
I think we oughta keep Mom
out of the pinot grigio.

01:00:15.386 --> 01:00:19.982
You have lost.
And now the invasion shall begin.

01:00:20.057 --> 01:00:22.491
Invasion? You mean there's
more of you guys coming?

01:00:22.559 --> 01:00:26.325
Many more. And we will crush you like bugs.

01:00:26.397 --> 01:00:30.128
- Not if we crush you first.
- I will not be beaten by children.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.137
Anymore signs of resistance,
and the one you call Jake will be eliminated.

01:00:36.306 --> 01:00:39.002
- I want Snuggle Lump back!
- That's it.

01:00:39.076 --> 01:00:41.010
Time to die.

01:00:42.079 --> 01:00:45.048
Richard?

01:00:45.115 --> 01:00:47.106
You remember Nana.

01:00:48.085 --> 01:00:49.677
Game on.

01:00:49.753 --> 01:00:51.846
Game over.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.925
Wow.

01:01:13.143 --> 01:01:17.443
- Whoa! What was that move?
- Double right-thumb click with a left-panel twist.

01:01:18.649 --> 01:01:20.412
Chinese get up!

01:01:24.688 --> 01:01:27.088
He's on the light! Send Nana after him!

01:01:29.159 --> 01:01:32.720
- Nana!
- Lee! Flying's your specialty.

01:01:54.184 --> 01:01:56.118
Ooh. Take him out, Lee.

01:01:56.186 --> 01:01:59.212
- Thumb cramp. Thumb cramp!
- Give it to me.

01:02:18.542 --> 01:02:20.976
- Ricky?
- What the--

01:02:24.581 --> 01:02:26.640
Nana?

01:02:35.993 --> 01:02:39.451
Yes, scream, human,
for your species ends tonight.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.266
What the heck was that thing?

01:02:45.335 --> 01:02:48.702
Space alien. Too much to explain.

01:02:48.772 --> 01:02:51.605
We think they're probably here
to destroy the world as we know it.

01:02:51.675 --> 01:02:54.542
If we don't get down there,
we're gonna be in real trouble.

01:02:54.611 --> 01:02:57.011
I'd say that's the
understatement of the century.

01:02:58.916 --> 01:03:01.043
Mom? Are you okay?

01:03:03.186 --> 01:03:08.146
What-- What happened?
How-- How did I get--

01:03:08.225 --> 01:03:10.853
- Oh, I need a glass of water.
- Uh--

01:03:10.928 --> 01:03:13.556
Okay. Somebody better start talking.

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:17.498
It looks like you guys
had a battle royal in here.

01:03:17.568 --> 01:03:20.002
- We did. Nana versus Ricky.
- Not now, Hannah.

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:23.164
- Dad, it's not what it looks like.
- All of you, upstairs, now.

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.004
- But, Uncle Stu, it wasn't our fault.
- Now.

01:03:29.646 --> 01:03:31.739
Get up.

01:03:31.815 --> 01:03:35.410
Okay, unless you wanna join them,
you better spill it.

01:03:35.485 --> 01:03:37.680
What the heck happened in here?

01:03:37.754 --> 01:03:39.847
I haven't got a clue as to what happened...

01:03:39.923 --> 01:03:43.415
but my back hasn't felt this good in ages.

01:03:45.128 --> 01:03:47.858
Mom? Mom? Where you goin'?

01:03:47.931 --> 01:03:50.024
Aliens.

01:03:58.842 --> 01:04:01.743
Build machine... now.

01:04:01.812 --> 01:04:03.939
No.

01:04:12.189 --> 01:04:14.419
I'm sorry, guys.

01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:17.626
It's over.

01:04:17.694 --> 01:04:20.185
Over? It better not be over.

01:04:20.263 --> 01:04:25.360
Ricky is down in the basement
with that... space rodent.

01:04:25.435 --> 01:04:28.802
You don't get it. An entire fleet
of those guys are about to invade.

01:04:28.872 --> 01:04:31.033
Well, man up and deal with it.

01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:33.770
I have been... all day.

01:04:33.844 --> 01:04:36.938
Well, if he¡¦s too scared,
maybe you guys can help me.

01:04:37.014 --> 01:04:40.609
- Not without Tom.
- Why?

01:04:40.684 --> 01:04:42.208
'Cause he's our leader.

01:04:44.321 --> 01:04:48.724
Come on. It's not just Ricky.
Jake needs your help too.

01:04:48.792 --> 01:04:50.783
And Snuggles.

01:04:50.861 --> 01:04:53.796
And, like, everyone on Earth,
including our parents.

01:05:03.573 --> 01:05:05.234
All right.

01:05:05.308 --> 01:05:07.936
Let's go save the planet.

01:05:08.879 --> 01:05:12.110
And your dumb old boyfriend.

01:05:41.712 --> 01:05:44.840
You want Monkey? He's good luck.

01:05:46.516 --> 01:05:48.507
I'm fine.

01:05:51.188 --> 01:05:53.452
Stay close.

01:05:53.523 --> 01:05:56.151
They could be anywhere.

01:06:32.763 --> 01:06:34.856
It's Jake!

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.897
Those Zirkonians--
They tied me up and dragged Snuggles outside.

01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.904
This vacation really sucks.

01:06:41.972 --> 01:06:44.839
- You see the machine?
- Yeah. You were right. It was sent here years ago.

01:06:44.908 --> 01:06:47.001
Some idiot built this place
smack on top of it.

01:06:47.077 --> 01:06:49.443
Guys? Guys, I found Ricky.

01:06:49.513 --> 01:06:51.913
- He's waking up.
- Where in the heck am I?

01:06:51.982 --> 01:06:55.042
Oh, baby, I'm so glad you¡¦re okay.

01:06:55.786 --> 01:06:58.254
Whoa! Don't touch me!

01:07:00.257 --> 01:07:01.884
- Stop.
- Okay, okay.

01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:06.418
I know it's been a really weird day,
but you have to let me explain.

01:07:06.496 --> 01:07:09.727
Okay. Okay.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.429
Explain to me why I keep blacking out,
why I'm bleeding...

01:07:13.503 --> 01:07:17.940
and why your grandma did
a flying ninja kick on my face down the stairs.

01:07:18.008 --> 01:07:20.101
Okay.

01:07:20.177 --> 01:07:23.271
We're fighting, um, space aliens.

01:07:23.346 --> 01:07:24.870
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:24.948 --> 01:07:28.782
Okay, they're small,
but dangerous and-- and really scary.

01:07:28.852 --> 01:07:31.286
Oh, no. Of course.
I believe you. Why wouldn't they be?

01:07:31.354 --> 01:07:35.415
Why do you want to waste our time
playing hide-and-seek and kill the aliens...

01:07:35.492 --> 01:07:37.960
with your stupid brother
and your dumb little cousins?

01:07:41.531 --> 01:07:43.624
Don't talk about my family like that.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:47.261
Well, you don't have to worry about it anymore
'cause we're done.

01:07:47.337 --> 01:07:50.932
I knew I should have stayed home
and hooked up with Annie Filkins.

01:07:51.007 --> 01:07:54.306
She's smokin' hot, and she doesn't like
talking about feelings all the time.

01:07:55.679 --> 01:07:57.772
I'm goin' straight to Annie's.

01:08:01.351 --> 01:08:03.285
Ow.

01:08:07.891 --> 01:08:10.291
I'm really sorry.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.193
Don't be. You were right all along.

01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:17.323
If it¡¦s any consolation,
he's not going straight to Annie's.

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:19.334
Or anywhere for a while.

01:08:19.402 --> 01:08:21.734
Wow.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:24.831
Guys? Enough of this sibling bonding.
We're at DEFCON 1 here.

01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:35.011
Go. Go! Rookie.

01:08:36.553 --> 01:08:40.319
Oh, my God. They're forcing him to build it.

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:43.359
Build what? How do you take over
the world with that thing?

01:08:43.426 --> 01:08:46.622
I really don't want to find out.
We gotta stop them before their fleet arrives.

01:08:46.696 --> 01:08:49.493
- Fleet?
- This is just the advance team.

01:08:49.566 --> 01:08:52.228
- We have to rescue Snuggle Lump.
- Snuggle what?

01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:55.362
Lump. The foreign fella. He's on our side.

01:08:55.438 --> 01:08:58.407
The other 3-- not so much.

01:08:58.475 --> 01:09:01.911
- This is so not happening.
- We gotta get out there. Let's move.

01:09:01.978 --> 01:09:06.915
Not so fast. I have a plan. Work with
me here. Did Nana give anyone Mentos?

01:09:06.983 --> 01:09:08.917
- Why?
- Hand 'em over!

01:09:08.984 --> 01:09:12.182
- What, we're gonna throw candy at them?
- No.

01:09:12.255 --> 01:09:14.553
My own little science project.

01:09:21.131 --> 01:09:23.258
Mentos bomb. You're a genius.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:25.163
You shouldn't do this.

01:09:25.234 --> 01:09:27.897
- Humans friendly. Whoa!
- Incoming!

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.930
In my eyes!

01:09:32.008 --> 01:09:33.532
- Let's get 'em!
- Move!

01:09:36.345 --> 01:09:39.372
- Snuggles!
- Traitor.

01:09:42.352 --> 01:09:45.947
- Release me.
- Never mess with a girl who just got dumped.

01:09:48.758 --> 01:09:51.591
He's out cold.

01:09:51.661 --> 01:09:54.220
- You!
- Get off my planet, you little green son of a--

01:10:09.813 --> 01:10:13.271
- How do you feel now?
- Weakness-- We found their weakness!

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:16.751
- It's their own death ray.
- Yes!

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:21.018
Bad. Not sweet. So not sweet.

01:10:26.029 --> 01:10:28.395
- Hey! Humans.
- Hey, listen.

01:10:28.465 --> 01:10:33.300
The machine molecule expands.
Machine make commander big.

01:10:38.308 --> 01:10:41.937
Who's little now, Earth maggots?

01:10:42.012 --> 01:10:46.005
- Pretty cool, huh?
- You're gonna need a bigger potato.

01:10:46.082 --> 01:10:48.550
It's over. I win.

01:10:48.618 --> 01:10:51.610
- Where's he going?
- Anywhere he wants.

01:10:51.688 --> 01:10:54.589
- What about Mommy and Daddy?
- Tom will figure it out.

01:11:06.503 --> 01:11:08.698
Everyone, listen. We don't have much time.

01:11:08.772 --> 01:11:11.332
- Sparks, can anything go on that machine?
- Theoretically.

01:11:11.408 --> 01:11:13.706
Good. Art, Lee, I'm gonna need a controller.

01:11:13.777 --> 01:11:16.109
- Bethany, I need you to keep the
other aliens on lockdown.   - Okay.

01:11:19.182 --> 01:11:21.116
Jake, come on.

01:11:21.184 --> 01:11:23.550
- This battle's not over yet.
- Awesome.

01:11:25.755 --> 01:11:27.655
There.

01:11:27.724 --> 01:11:30.158
Cool. He super-sized it.

01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:33.654
You are one ugly alien.

01:11:36.866 --> 01:11:39.494
He may be ugly, but he's mine.

01:11:39.569 --> 01:11:41.560
You don't know when to quit, do you?

01:11:44.607 --> 01:11:47.701
- We need a clean shot at his neck.
- I'm goin' up.

01:11:53.616 --> 01:11:58.019
- Ow! You broke my nail!
- I don't care.

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.357
Whoa!

01:12:09.566 --> 01:12:13.400
- Ah!
- Oh, my gosh. They're beacons.

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:15.370
He's calling the invasion.

01:12:17.307 --> 01:12:19.104
[Stuart]
Wow.

01:12:19.175 --> 01:12:21.700
- Unbelievable.
- Look at this.

01:12:21.778 --> 01:12:25.680
God bless America.
Now that's what I call a patriot act.

01:12:25.748 --> 01:12:28.876
It's not bad,
but it's nothin' compared to this.

01:12:28.952 --> 01:12:32.911
Whoa, whoa. Those are category-3
pyrotechnics you got there.

01:12:32.989 --> 01:12:35.014
I suppose that's another ticket.

01:12:37.193 --> 01:12:39.787
Light 'em up. Let's put that guy to shame.

01:12:42.599 --> 01:12:44.965
I got it! Tom! Tom, I found it.

01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:50.205
Get him to turn around!

01:12:50.273 --> 01:12:54.642
Hey! Down here, you prehistoric space scum!

01:13:00.049 --> 01:13:02.745
- Ooh.
- Nice one, Nate.

01:13:02.819 --> 01:13:07.984
That was awesome! Those things
only cost $1.99. Can you believe it?

01:13:08.057 --> 01:13:11.390
- I don't think that's you, Nate.
- What is that?

01:13:11.461 --> 01:13:15.955
It's them. They'll all be coming soon.

01:13:16.032 --> 01:13:18.592
Open your eyes, people.

01:13:18.668 --> 01:13:21.466
There's only one answer-- meteor shower.

01:13:21.538 --> 01:13:25.497
- Oh, that's right. I heard on the radio.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:13:29.913 --> 01:13:33.110
Is that all ya got?

01:13:33.183 --> 01:13:37.313
- Hey.
- Come on!

01:13:38.421 --> 01:13:40.981
Tom! Take the shot!

01:13:41.057 --> 01:13:44.823
- Shoot him!
- His collar's still in the way.

01:13:44.894 --> 01:13:48.421
Look out! The ugly one got big!

01:13:48.498 --> 01:13:52.559
- Hurry. Do it, Tom!
- 50 yards.

01:13:52.635 --> 01:13:56.833
Angle equals one-half arc sine of gravity
times distance over velocity squared.

01:13:56.906 --> 01:13:59.204
45 degrees.

01:13:59.275 --> 01:14:01.709
What was that?

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.940
You messed with the wrong mathlete.

01:14:16.092 --> 01:14:17.684
- Yes.
- Get him away from him.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.092
Commander. Hey, wait a second.

01:14:21.931 --> 01:14:24.399
Take that.

01:14:24.467 --> 01:14:27.459
- Puny humans, is that all you have?
- Whoa, he's good.

01:14:31.407 --> 01:14:33.398
No, you don't.

01:14:34.877 --> 01:14:36.742
You see that?

01:14:36.813 --> 01:14:39.839
Sparks! Reverse the machine.

01:14:50.627 --> 01:14:53.095
- Too easy.
- Uh--

01:14:55.431 --> 01:14:57.592
- Nothing's working.
- Give it to me.

01:15:01.337 --> 01:15:03.567
- Crude.
- But effective.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.540
That was awesome.

01:15:08.444 --> 01:15:11.208
- Reversed.
- Tommy, he's done.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.288
- You came back for me.
- Let's go.

01:15:26.362 --> 01:15:28.922
We can hug lips on Zirkon.

01:15:36.105 --> 01:15:37.902
Whoa!

01:15:39.242 --> 01:15:41.210
Bethany!

01:15:41.277 --> 01:15:42.767
- Hannah, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:42.845 --> 01:15:45.279
Over here.
Did you guys see that? Great job, Hannah.

01:15:45.348 --> 01:15:48.875
- Snugs was great. So were you guys.
- Tom, what about the others?

01:15:48.951 --> 01:15:51.886
There's so many.

01:15:58.127 --> 01:16:01.426
Retreat. Retreat. The machine is destroyed.

01:16:01.497 --> 01:16:05.092
We have been outsmarted by the humans.

01:16:05.168 --> 01:16:09.264
The invasion has failed.
Retreat to Zirkon right away.

01:16:09.339 --> 01:16:12.467
Retreat. Retreat.

01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:18.146
Whoa.

01:16:19.949 --> 01:16:22.782
He's gone.

01:16:22.852 --> 01:16:26.447
It's over. It's all over.

01:16:26.522 --> 01:16:28.456
We won.

01:16:30.626 --> 01:16:33.493
Thanks, Snugs, for everything.

01:16:33.563 --> 01:16:36.657
You're all right for a space maggot.
I'm gonna miss you.

01:16:36.733 --> 01:16:40.328
Miss him? He's staying here, with us.

01:16:41.571 --> 01:16:44.369
Please don't go.
You can be a part of our family.

01:16:57.186 --> 01:17:00.553
Han, I think he's already got a family.

01:17:02.959 --> 01:17:04.950
My family.

01:17:15.204 --> 01:17:17.729
Good-bye, Hannah.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.179
Hey.

01:18:06.255 --> 01:18:08.246
Hey.

01:18:10.993 --> 01:18:15.157
- Listen, about your grades--
- Dad, let me save you a lecture.

01:18:15.231 --> 01:18:18.064
You were right, and I was wrong.

01:18:18.134 --> 01:18:22.127
Turns out there are advantages
to being smart.

01:18:23.539 --> 01:18:25.530
I'm sorry.

01:18:27.376 --> 01:18:29.503
I had this really great lecture planned.

01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:32.707
Even rehearsed it in front of the mirror.

01:18:38.688 --> 01:18:40.622
Did you see the meteor shower?

01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:42.954
Yeah. Yeah, it was life-changing.

01:18:48.231 --> 01:18:51.223
- Nice cast, Nana.
- Hey.

01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:54.326
Whoa, whoa! Got a bite. Got a bite.

01:18:54.403 --> 01:18:56.928
Oh, yeah. Come on.

01:19:12.388 --> 01:19:16.324
You're out of this world, I'm sure

01:19:18.661 --> 01:19:22.028
- Annie!
- Ricky, I thought you were at your lake house.

01:19:22.098 --> 01:19:25.363
- Vacation ended early. These are for you.
- You're so sweet.

01:19:25.434 --> 01:19:27.493
Hey, you're my girlfriend now.

01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:30.869
So there is nothing I wouldn't do for you.
Now give papa some--

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:35.138
Hoo-hoo-hoo! Ladies.

01:19:35.211 --> 01:19:37.509
It's girls' night out.
But, hey, you should come--

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.744
- If you like dancing.
- Dancing?

01:19:41.817 --> 01:19:44.012
You ain't even seen dancing--

01:19:44.086 --> 01:19:47.146
Till you've seen funky Ricky.

01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.964
Wedgie time.

01:20:00.036 --> 01:20:01.663
Cannonball.

01:20:01.737 --> 01:20:03.466
I think he's hungry.

01:20:06.642 --> 01:20:08.940
Turn him off.

01:20:10.079 --> 01:20:12.673
Ricky, you're acting really weird.

01:20:12.748 --> 01:20:15.148
What are you talking about?

01:20:15.217 --> 01:20:17.082
Okay, now back on.

01:20:28.064 --> 01:20:29.895
I am so keeping this.

01:20:29.966 --> 01:20:33.231
Why?

01:20:33.302 --> 01:20:37.432
Hey, so strange
You switched in front of me

01:20:37.506 --> 01:20:41.704
<i>* Hey, you've changed
Not like you used to be</i>

01:20:41.777 --> 01:20:43.870
<i>* 'Cause you get in my head
and hold my heart</i>

01:20:43.946 --> 01:20:46.039
<i>* When I'm here, you're there
We're worlds apart</i>

01:20:46.115 --> 01:20:50.609
<i>* So reverse your words back to the start
and switch back to my world</i>

01:20:50.686 --> 01:20:54.884
<i>* Hey, you're just talking like a machine</i>

01:20:54.957 --> 01:20:59.155
<i>* Hey, I'm stuck on everyone in between</i>

01:20:59.228 --> 01:21:01.253
<i>* 'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart</i>

01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:03.423
<i>* When I'm here, you're there
We're worlds apart</i>

01:21:03.499 --> 01:21:08.664
<i>* So reverse your words back to the start
and switch back to my world</i>

01:21:10.439 --> 01:21:16.378
<i>* You're out of this world
I'm sure of it</i>

01:21:16.445 --> 01:21:18.811
<i>* A crazy intuition</i>

01:21:18.881 --> 01:21:22.715
<i>* You're off and on
You're here, then gone</i>

01:21:22.785 --> 01:21:25.219
<i>* Come back</i>

01:21:25.287 --> 01:21:27.414
<i>* A curious condition</i>

01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:30.755
<i>* And then you switch right over</i>

01:21:30.826 --> 01:21:32.760
<i>* It's weird
Yeah, I know</i>

01:21:32.828 --> 01:21:36.423
<i>* But just can't get a hold of myself</i>

01:21:36.499 --> 01:21:40.629
<i>* Hey, so strange
You switched in front of me</i>

01:21:40.703 --> 01:21:44.901
<i>* Hey, you've changed
Not like you used to be</i>

01:21:44.974 --> 01:21:47.067
<i>* 'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart</i>

01:21:47.143 --> 01:21:49.236

We're worlds apart</i>

01:21:49.311 --> 01:21:53.805

01:21:53.883 --> 01:21:58.081

01:22:13.703 --> 01:22:19.573
<i>* You're out of this world
I'm sure of it</i>

01:22:19.642 --> 01:22:22.076
<i>* A little more than different</i>

01:22:22.144 --> 01:22:26.774
<i>* And you keep lacking
lacking concern for it</i>

01:22:28.551 --> 01:22:30.781
<i>* It's you that I am missing</i>

01:22:30.853 --> 01:22:33.981
<i>* And then you switch right over</i>

01:22:34.056 --> 01:22:35.990
<i>* It's weird
Yeah, I know</i>

01:22:36.058 --> 01:22:39.585

01:22:39.662 --> 01:22:43.792

01:23:15.164 --> 01:23:19.328
<i>* Wonder where you are
How can I find you</i>

01:23:19.401 --> 01:23:23.565
<i>* Staring at the stars falling behind you</i>

01:23:23.639 --> 01:23:28.042
<i>* Across the universe
Hope you'll be back soon</i>

01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:31.546
<i>* I gotta find a planet for me
I'll rearrange it</i>

01:23:34.383 --> 01:23:38.342

you switched in front of me</i>

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:42.720

01:24:13.289 --> 01:24:16.053
- Here comes the magic.
- Take 2.

01:24:30.406 --> 01:24:33.534
Whoa, whoa! Crazy girl.

01:24:35.678 --> 01:24:39.114
You think Brittany--
You think Bethany got--

01:24:39.181 --> 01:24:42.378
To make a phone call
with the intent to annoy or harass...

01:24:42.451 --> 01:24:46.683
is a serious, serious, serious, serious--

01:24:54.096 --> 01:24:57.361
You mean other than the fact
that he's good-looking, sweet--

01:24:57.433 --> 01:24:59.424
Smart, sensitive-- Oh, gosh.

01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:03.460
Good-looking, smart, sensitive, romantic--
I said he was smart.

01:25:08.277 --> 01:25:11.246
Come on.
we're only a stone's away-- throw away--

01:25:13.883 --> 01:25:18.217
Hey, I bought us all new side-stab--
Anti-rapers--

01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:22.087
- Can't you get somebody else for this role?
- Action.

01:25:25.928 --> 01:25:29.864
You are floating.

01:25:31.567 --> 01:25:33.535
Duck!

01:25:33.602 --> 01:25:37.299
Cool it.
You could have poked my eye out.

01:25:37.373 --> 01:25:40.103
Liberty Lions, come on, come on!

01:25:40.175 --> 01:25:42.905
Ricky Dillman is a big moron!

01:25:42.978 --> 01:25:44.969
Whoo!
