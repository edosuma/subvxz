WEBVTT

00:07.684 --> 00:09.884
Thank you.

00:11.120 --> 00:14.489
You've got the police chief of
Rome and his people at 3:30.

00:14.491 --> 00:16.958
Make sure the espresso machine
is up and running.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.260
Good. Done.

00:19.262 --> 00:20.428
Pretty much.

00:20.430 --> 00:21.562
Let's have it.
Believe me,

00:21.564 --> 00:22.597
you don't want it.

00:22.599 --> 00:24.165
A group called
“Battle for Peace”

00:24.167 --> 00:25.600
is applying for a permit

00:25.602 --> 00:28.169
to demonstrate
at Veterans Memorial Plaza.

00:28.171 --> 00:29.804
Battle for Peace
is an oxymoron.

00:29.806 --> 00:31.439
Emphasis on “moron.”

00:31.441 --> 00:32.874
That goes to Community Affairs.

00:32.876 --> 00:35.309
It did. From the lieutenant

00:35.311 --> 00:37.311
to the captain,
to the C.O.,

00:37.313 --> 00:39.046
to the chief, to you.

00:39.048 --> 00:41.249
Demonstrations are being held
every day in this city.

00:41.251 --> 00:43.818
Now can I please have my coffee
and read my paper?

00:43.820 --> 00:48.489
Not demonstrations that involve
burning an American flag.

00:51.060 --> 00:53.294
All right.

00:53.296 --> 00:55.396
They're led by a kid
named David Gore--

00:55.398 --> 00:57.398
young but smart, media-savvy.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.100
You want me to contact legal?

00:59.102 --> 01:00.701
Maybe there's a way out of this.

01:00.703 --> 01:04.272
Supreme Court says flag-burning
is protected speech.

01:04.274 --> 01:08.276
Having said that,
I want a sit-down

01:08.278 --> 01:11.012
with this media-savvy whiz kid.

01:11.014 --> 01:12.346
You sure that's a good idea?

01:12.348 --> 01:14.815
No, but set it up.

01:20.256 --> 01:23.024
So, thank you for letting us
come talk to you guys today.

01:23.026 --> 01:26.093
And remember, if you need help,
that's what we're here for.

01:26.095 --> 01:28.863
(applause)

01:30.199 --> 01:31.999
Now, Officers Reagan
and Janko have agreed

01:32.001 --> 01:33.801
to answer some questions?
Yeah.

01:34.637 --> 01:35.670
Rita.

01:35.672 --> 01:37.872
Do you ever worry
about getting hurt?

01:37.874 --> 01:40.575
That's a risk that you take when
you become a police officer.

01:40.577 --> 01:42.276
But we try to be careful.

01:42.278 --> 01:43.411
JAMIE:
We're trained to handle

01:43.413 --> 01:44.712
all types of
situations, and you rely

01:44.714 --> 01:46.881
on your partner
to watch your back.

01:46.883 --> 01:48.950
Officer Janko?

01:48.952 --> 01:51.819
Aren't you kind of hot to be a cop?
(laughter)

01:51.821 --> 01:53.287
Tommy, that's
inappropriate.

01:53.289 --> 01:56.123
That's the reason that I ride
with Officer Reagan.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.659
It kind of balances things out
a little bit.

01:58.661 --> 02:01.095
(laughter)

02:02.031 --> 02:03.064
Lily.

02:03.066 --> 02:04.599
You said it's the NYPD's job

02:04.601 --> 02:05.800
to help people?

02:05.802 --> 02:07.468
That's right.

02:07.470 --> 02:09.437
Well, a cop killed my father.

02:09.439 --> 02:10.770
He didn't do anything wrong,

02:10.773 --> 02:13.774
but they shot him anyway.

02:15.311 --> 02:17.478
Cops are murderers.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.880
(students murmuring quietly)

02:23.219 --> 02:25.620
Got it. We're on our way.

02:25.622 --> 02:28.089
Port Authority cop
just detained our guy.

02:28.091 --> 02:29.890
Told you he'd try
to skip town.

02:29.892 --> 02:31.892
Must be your lucky day.
Yup.

02:32.829 --> 02:33.995
Detective Reagan?

02:33.997 --> 02:36.330
Yeah?
Anthony Abetemarco.

02:36.332 --> 02:38.132
I'm an investigator
for the D.A.'s office.

02:38.134 --> 02:39.934
Oh. Congratulations.

02:39.936 --> 02:41.769
Whatever it is
will have to wait.

02:41.771 --> 02:43.804
Yeah, you worked
the Marcus Donovan homicide

02:43.806 --> 02:44.905
with Detective Darryl Reid?

02:44.907 --> 02:46.507
Yeah, about a hundred
years ago. Why?

02:46.509 --> 02:47.875
What's this all about?

02:47.877 --> 02:50.211
There's evidence of serious
procedural irregularities

02:50.213 --> 02:51.879
by the NYPD.

02:52.849 --> 02:56.017
Detective Reid's already
jammed up.

02:56.019 --> 02:58.219
Now we want to talk to you.

03:00.523 --> 03:02.957
Right this way.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.693
ANTHONY:
You know you're under

03:05.695 --> 03:07.595
no obligation to speak
to me, Detective.

03:07.597 --> 03:10.665
Well, I got
nothing to hide.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.901
What was your relationship
with Detective Reid?

03:13.903 --> 03:16.270
Well, we weren't dating,
if that's what you mean.

03:16.272 --> 03:17.838
You think this is a joke?
Yeah, I do

03:17.840 --> 03:20.141
think it's a joke. In fact,
I think it's a bunch of crap.

03:20.143 --> 03:21.809
All right? I worked
with the guy

03:21.811 --> 03:23.377
for eight months seven years
ago. He was a good cop.

03:23.379 --> 03:24.445
Yeah, well, we have reason

03:24.447 --> 03:26.113
to believe
he planted blood evidence

03:26.115 --> 03:27.481
on the clothing

03:27.483 --> 03:29.417
of Marcus Donovan,
which led to his conviction.

03:29.419 --> 03:31.285
What led to his conviction
was the fact

03:31.287 --> 03:32.687
that he killed an elderly couple

03:32.689 --> 03:34.522
after they cashed
their Social Security check.

03:34.524 --> 03:35.956
There were no witnesses.

03:35.958 --> 03:37.892
The gun was never recovered.

03:37.894 --> 03:39.326
There's no witnesses

03:39.328 --> 03:41.762
because everybody's scared
to death of Marcus Donovan

03:41.764 --> 03:44.398
'cause he's a maniac.
The fact remains that Donovan was convicted

03:44.400 --> 03:46.934
because the victims' blood
was found on his shirt,

03:46.936 --> 03:48.769
and Reid put it there.

03:48.771 --> 03:50.271
The question is,

03:50.273 --> 03:52.006
did you know about it?

03:52.008 --> 03:53.908
You're joking, right?

03:53.910 --> 03:56.277
If you were part of this
in any way, Detective,

03:56.279 --> 03:57.745
now's the time to come clean.

03:57.747 --> 04:00.147
I mean, come on,
I ask that question of perps

04:00.149 --> 04:01.949
every single day myself,
all right?

04:03.119 --> 04:04.819
(knocking)

04:04.821 --> 04:06.587
We got a
time-sensitive matter

04:06.589 --> 04:08.255
related to an ongoing
investigation.

04:08.257 --> 04:09.990
What do you know? Got to go.

04:09.992 --> 04:11.692
I got more questions,
Detective.

04:11.694 --> 04:13.260
Have fun with that.

04:13.262 --> 04:15.229
What is he talking about
in there?

04:15.231 --> 04:17.130
Nothing. Bunch of hot air.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.166
You think they're trying to get
you to hang Reid out to dry?

04:20.168 --> 04:21.869
Reid is a good cop, okay?

04:21.870 --> 04:24.405
He would never have to plant
evidence to make a case,

04:24.407 --> 04:27.108
especially against a
rat like Marcus Donovan.

04:27.110 --> 04:28.809
Sounds like
they got him pretty good.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.444
Come on. He's a
decorated detective.

04:30.446 --> 04:32.480
Marcus Donovan's got
a rap sheet a mile long.

04:32.482 --> 04:35.282
Who would you believe? And
why'd you pull me out of there?

04:35.284 --> 04:36.650
What's so pressing?

04:38.721 --> 04:40.888
Close the door.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.093
What are you doing here?

04:46.095 --> 04:49.997
Violating about a dozen rules
of protocol, but we got to talk.

04:49.999 --> 04:53.067
Does this have anything to do
with, uh, your crony over here

04:53.069 --> 04:55.770
asking me questions about
a case from seven years ago?

04:55.772 --> 04:57.671
Yeah, and you didn't
hear it from me,

04:57.673 --> 05:00.341
but don't say another word
without an attorney present.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.109
Why the hell
do I need a lawyer?

05:02.111 --> 05:05.246
We've been investigating
Darryl Reid for two months.

05:05.248 --> 05:07.114
We have him dead
to rights on perjury

05:07.116 --> 05:08.816
and tampering
with physical evidence.

05:08.818 --> 05:10.951
I don't believe it.

05:10.953 --> 05:12.653
Yeah, well, you better.

05:13.923 --> 05:15.489
His career is in
serious jeopardy,

05:15.491 --> 05:17.057
and he's probably going to jail.

05:17.059 --> 05:21.128
And anyone complicit in
those crimes is going down, too.

05:51.342 --> 05:53.337
I'm really sorry
about Lily's outburst.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.597
That's okay. Do you know
what happened with her father?

05:56.133 --> 05:58.467
All I know is he was shot by a
police officer three years ago

05:58.469 --> 06:00.369
and Lily's been in a
downward spiral ever since.

06:00.371 --> 06:01.803
And she lives
with her mom now?

06:01.805 --> 06:04.206
Lily's mother has
substance abuse issues.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.141
Disappeared a few months
after the shooting.

06:06.143 --> 06:07.876
Lily lives with
her grandmother now.

06:07.878 --> 06:09.177
She's had her share
of heartache.

06:09.179 --> 06:10.612
Before the shooting, Lily
was an excellent student.

06:10.614 --> 06:13.015
Now she barely shows
up, and when she does,

06:13.017 --> 06:14.950
she's combative,
disrespectful.

06:14.952 --> 06:17.019
Has anyone tried to help her?

06:17.021 --> 06:18.854
A counselor or a shrink?

06:18.856 --> 06:20.589
All of the above. Lily
wants no part of it.

06:20.591 --> 06:21.924
Any trouble outside of school?

06:21.926 --> 06:23.926
Well, caught smoking pot,
drinking.

06:23.928 --> 06:25.928
The grandmother
can't control her?

06:25.930 --> 06:27.029
She's a nice lady,

06:27.031 --> 06:28.931
but she's in over
her head with Lily.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.365
Seems like
we all are.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.668
Is there anything
that we can do to help?

06:32.670 --> 06:34.703
(school bell rings)
(sighs)

06:34.705 --> 06:36.371
Lily's angry at the world.

06:36.373 --> 06:38.006
She doesn't
trust anyone.

06:38.008 --> 06:39.541
Unfortunately, that all started

06:39.543 --> 06:42.177
with someone
wearing a uniform like yours.

06:45.015 --> 06:47.215
(indistinct conversations)

06:51.221 --> 06:52.554
(laughs)

06:52.556 --> 06:54.923
There he is.

06:54.925 --> 06:56.592
Pride of the 5-4 squad.

06:56.594 --> 06:58.927
Darryl Reid.
How you doing?

06:58.929 --> 07:01.330
Ah. Depends on
who you ask.

07:01.332 --> 07:02.998
You look good, Danny.
Thank you.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.334
How's the family?
Eh, okay.

07:05.336 --> 07:07.736
How about you?
How's the wife?

07:07.738 --> 07:10.305
Actually,
we split up last year.

07:10.307 --> 07:11.707
I'm sorry.

07:11.709 --> 07:14.142
Ah, finally came to her senses.

07:14.144 --> 07:15.744
You know how it goes.

07:15.746 --> 07:17.245
Yes. (laughs)

07:17.247 --> 07:18.480
I'm starting to figure it out.

07:18.482 --> 07:23.085
Look, I, uh, got a visit
from the D.A.'s office

07:23.087 --> 07:25.220
about the Marcus Donovan case.

07:25.222 --> 07:27.155
They got nothing better
to do than dig up

07:27.157 --> 07:29.791
good collars and rip 'em apart.

07:29.793 --> 07:32.361
They say
you planted blood on Donovan.

07:32.363 --> 07:33.996
What'd you say?

07:33.998 --> 07:36.565
Said you're the best detective
I ever worked with.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.066
You're a stand-up guy, Danny.

07:38.068 --> 07:40.235
I told 'em you're the last guy
in the world

07:40.237 --> 07:41.670
who'd need to fix a case.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.107
I mean, that's true, isn't it?

07:45.109 --> 07:48.844
He slaughtered that couple
for 300 bucks.

07:48.846 --> 07:50.545
He got what he had coming.

07:50.547 --> 07:52.447
I agree.

07:52.449 --> 07:54.983
I'm also getting the feeling
you're gonna tell me something

07:54.985 --> 07:57.586
that I really don't want
to hear right now.

08:01.759 --> 08:03.825
The case stalled.

08:03.827 --> 08:05.127
We had nothing solid.

08:05.129 --> 08:06.828
It was going cold.

08:06.830 --> 08:10.399
ADA wasn't gonna charge Donovan.

08:10.401 --> 08:12.167
So you flake the guy?

08:16.940 --> 08:19.941
Where the hell did you even get
the blood to plant on him?

08:19.943 --> 08:23.311
I dropped by the M.E.'s office
where they autopsied the vics.

08:23.313 --> 08:25.947
You stole the blood
from the lab?

08:25.949 --> 08:27.616
He was gonna walk, Danny.

08:28.819 --> 08:32.287
Now, when the D.A.
reopened the case,

08:32.289 --> 08:34.322
forensics turns up lab chemicals

08:34.323 --> 08:36.558
in the blood
I put on Donovan's shirt.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.659
Well, it makes sense why
they're looking at me now.

08:38.662 --> 08:41.363
Relax. I told 'em you had
nothing to do with it.

08:41.365 --> 08:44.198
Well, I don't think your word
carries a lot of weight

08:44.201 --> 08:46.368
with them right now,
just saying.

08:46.370 --> 08:48.670
Sounds like
you're taking their side.

08:48.672 --> 08:51.206
I'm not taking their side,
but you did just tell me

08:51.208 --> 08:53.678
that you tampered with evidence
in a homicide.

08:53.679 --> 08:55.944
This animal would've taken more lives
if we didn't put him in a cage.

08:55.946 --> 08:57.179
You got a problem with that?

08:57.181 --> 08:59.414
I got a problem with you
not telling me what you did.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.383
I was your partner.
It was my case, too.

09:01.385 --> 09:02.517
I could have helped you.

09:02.519 --> 09:04.352
I was trying to protect you.

09:04.354 --> 09:05.787
Okay? Just in case

09:05.789 --> 09:08.390
something like this happened.

09:09.827 --> 09:12.761
Now I got to pay the price.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.834
I'm sorry
you got jammed up, Danny,

09:18.836 --> 09:21.837
but I could not
let that bastard skate,

09:21.839 --> 09:24.606
so I did what I had to do.

09:32.783 --> 09:34.349
(door opens)

09:34.351 --> 09:36.418
BAKER:
Excuse me.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.353
I have David Gore
for you, Commissioner.

09:39.757 --> 09:42.290
Well, let's have him.

09:44.428 --> 09:45.927
Thanks for coming in.

09:45.929 --> 09:47.896
May I call you David?
Of course.

09:47.898 --> 09:49.598
Please.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.267
It's good to meet you,
Commissioner.

09:52.269 --> 09:55.937
I've reviewed your application
to demonstrate.

09:55.939 --> 09:57.272
Is that standard procedure?

09:57.274 --> 09:59.274
It is not.

09:59.276 --> 10:01.243
But I have some questions.

10:01.245 --> 10:03.845
Chief among them if we intend
to burn the American flag?

10:03.847 --> 10:05.781
That would be one of them.

10:05.783 --> 10:07.115
We do.

10:09.052 --> 10:11.319
Well, of course,
that is your right.

10:11.321 --> 10:12.921
It is.
But you and I

10:12.923 --> 10:16.625
both know that that's gonna
make a lot of people very angry.

10:16.627 --> 10:18.460
“Peace demands
the most heroic labor

10:18.462 --> 10:19.895
and the most
difficult sacrifice.”

10:19.897 --> 10:21.163
Thomas Merton.

10:21.165 --> 10:23.198
I'm impressed.

10:23.200 --> 10:28.069
Look, David, you and I don't
agree on a whole hell of a lot,

10:28.071 --> 10:30.972
but whatever message
you're trying to send here--

10:30.974 --> 10:33.508
burning the flag
will drown it out.

10:33.510 --> 10:35.644
It is a polarizing act.

10:36.822 --> 10:39.235
But the pro-war forces
in this country have

10:39.236 --> 10:40.435
vastly superior resources,

10:40.437 --> 10:42.904
which forces us
to take radical action.

10:42.906 --> 10:44.773
At the Veterans Memorial.

10:44.775 --> 10:46.374
We respect the sacrifice
of veterans.

10:46.376 --> 10:49.711
Now, why dishonor them when your
argument is with the government?

10:49.713 --> 10:51.546
My father was a Marine.

10:53.283 --> 10:55.450
He died in Iraq in 1990.

10:56.853 --> 10:59.654
Then the memorial honors
his service.

10:59.656 --> 11:01.322
The only thing
his death accomplished

11:01.324 --> 11:02.924
was to strengthen
the war machine

11:02.926 --> 11:04.225
that runs this country.

11:04.227 --> 11:08.029
Sometimes you have to fight
for what you believe in.

11:08.832 --> 11:11.700
That's exactly why I'm here.

11:12.569 --> 11:15.403

11:51.241 --> 11:53.575
Linda said you
were working late.

11:53.577 --> 11:56.044
Well, I do have active cases.

11:56.046 --> 11:59.414
Unless, of course, you're here
to, uh, charge me, too.

11:59.416 --> 12:02.884
You've been cleared of any
wrongdoing in the Donovan case.

12:02.886 --> 12:04.219
Whoo-hoo!

12:04.221 --> 12:06.988
You don't seem
very relieved.

12:06.990 --> 12:08.690
Well, I didn't do
anything wrong.

12:08.692 --> 12:11.426
And, then, what's gonna happen
to Marcus Donovan now?

12:12.462 --> 12:15.096
Judge ordered a new trial
on the murder charges.

12:15.098 --> 12:17.432
So there's a chance
the son of a bitch

12:17.434 --> 12:19.000
could stay behind bars?

12:19.002 --> 12:21.436
Unfortunately, the case is thin,

12:21.438 --> 12:23.505
and in light of
Reid's actions,

12:23.507 --> 12:27.308
I think a conviction
is highly unlikely.

12:28.779 --> 12:31.980
Which means a murderer is free
to start killing all over again.

12:46.839 --> 12:48.705
Hey! Hey!

12:48.707 --> 12:52.576
(indistinct shouts,
crowd yelling)

12:55.481 --> 12:57.281
Those bastards
have no right!

12:57.283 --> 12:59.516
Unfortunately,
Sid, they do.

12:59.518 --> 13:01.487
And they know
how to get their message out.

13:01.488 --> 13:02.553
They're slapping the face
of everyone

13:02.555 --> 13:04.091
who ever wore the uniform.

13:04.092 --> 13:05.158
They don't see it that way.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.425
Well, what other way
is there?

13:06.427 --> 13:08.861
If this wasn't gonna make
the front page before,

13:08.863 --> 13:10.629
it sure will now.

13:10.631 --> 13:12.998
Yeah, well, you play with fire,
you get burned.

13:18.639 --> 13:19.805
DANNY:
Hey.

13:19.807 --> 13:21.340
Hey.
(groans) Let me guess.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.075
You're here
to investigate <i> us.</i>

13:23.077 --> 13:25.344
No. I don't hold a grudge.
Since when?

13:25.346 --> 13:27.980
Look, I need to talk to
you about Marcus Donovan.

13:27.982 --> 13:30.516
Start talking.
You guys are not seriously thinking

13:30.518 --> 13:32.051
about dropping
charges against him.

13:32.053 --> 13:34.520
Well, the D.A.
hasn't signed off on it,

13:34.522 --> 13:36.055
but it's headed that way.

13:36.057 --> 13:37.756
Come on, Erin,
you can't do that.

13:37.758 --> 13:38.824
Danny...

13:38.826 --> 13:41.126
He killed those people.
Okay, I believe you,

13:41.128 --> 13:44.196
but I still need <i> something</i>
to prove it in court.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.498
Reid falsified the evidence
because you guys

13:46.500 --> 13:48.467
didn't have enough
to nail Donovan.

13:48.469 --> 13:49.835
I know that!
Okay,

13:49.837 --> 13:52.137
so no physical evidence,
no witnesses...

13:52.139 --> 13:54.406
I know!
and after seven years,

13:54.408 --> 13:57.209
the chance of you building
a solid case is slim to none.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.411
I know that, too, okay?

13:59.413 --> 14:01.647
But Marcus Donovan doesn't.

14:04.285 --> 14:06.719
It's not gonna work, Danny.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.554
Look, we meet with him,
and you tell him

14:08.556 --> 14:11.156
you'll reduce his sentence
if he pleads guilty.

14:11.158 --> 14:12.992
He'd accept that why?
Because if he's found guilty

14:12.994 --> 14:16.228
in a new trial, he's gonna end
up right back where he started.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.964
Come on, it's worth a shot.

14:18.966 --> 14:20.566
It's a long shot, Danny.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.468
Donovan has
a smart enough lawyer

14:22.470 --> 14:24.770
to get his conviction
overturned.

14:26.707 --> 14:28.774
Listen.

14:28.776 --> 14:30.175
Reid screwed up.

14:30.177 --> 14:31.510
Okay? I know it.

14:31.512 --> 14:33.479
But I worked this case, too.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.080
If this guy
walks now,

14:35.082 --> 14:37.683
it's gonna be on me.

14:39.287 --> 14:41.587
Please.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.162
There she is.

14:50.164 --> 14:51.297
Hey, look,

14:51.299 --> 14:53.299
I know you're just trying
to help this girl.

14:53.301 --> 14:55.734
I-I'm just not sure this is
the right way to do it.

14:55.736 --> 14:57.636
She has a right
to know the truth.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.240
Come on.

15:06.013 --> 15:08.013
Hey, Lily.

15:08.015 --> 15:09.615
Remember us?

15:09.617 --> 15:11.717
Yeah. Screw you.

15:11.719 --> 15:12.918
Hey, watch

15:12.920 --> 15:16.155

You guys gonna shoot me, too?

to your father, Lily?

15:19.493 --> 15:21.160
(sighs)

15:21.162 --> 15:23.696
He was walking home
from the store one night,

15:23.698 --> 15:26.899
when a couple of cops
started hassling him.

15:26.901 --> 15:28.233
And when he tried

15:28.235 --> 15:30.836
to walk away, they shot him.

15:30.838 --> 15:31.937
Who told you that?

15:31.939 --> 15:35.140
My mom--
before she took off--

15:35.142 --> 15:36.742
and my grandmother.

15:36.744 --> 15:38.644
Yeah, well, that's
not exactly how it went down.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.678
How would you know?

15:39.680 --> 15:41.113
I read the police report.

15:41.115 --> 15:43.716
This may be really hard
for you to hear, but...

15:43.718 --> 15:46.285
your father was caught
selling drugs.

15:46.287 --> 15:48.253
That's a lie.
During the arrest,

15:48.255 --> 15:50.055
your father pulled a gun
out of his pocket,

15:50.057 --> 15:51.590
and that's when
the officers shot him.

15:51.592 --> 15:54.626
The cops made that stuff up so
they wouldn't lose their jobs.

15:54.628 --> 15:56.795
They recovered
the drugs and the gun, Lily.

15:56.797 --> 15:58.297
And there were witnesses.

15:58.299 --> 16:01.400
My father was a good guy...

16:01.402 --> 16:03.969
and you guys killed him.

16:03.971 --> 16:06.405
He probably was
a really good guy,

16:06.407 --> 16:07.840
but he made some mistakes,

16:07.842 --> 16:10.509
and it cost him his life.

16:11.779 --> 16:13.879
We don't want you
going down the same road.

16:13.881 --> 16:15.748

16:34.869 --> 16:36.668

16:36.670 --> 16:38.370
Mild concussion,

16:38.372 --> 16:40.205
a few stitches-- I'll live.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.976
Could have been a lot worse.

16:43.978 --> 16:46.145
And it didn't have to happen.

16:46.147 --> 16:47.246
I'm glad it did.

16:55.656 --> 16:57.222
weren't seriously injured.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.624
No thanks to your officers.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.592
The police assigned
to protect us

17:00.594 --> 17:02.861
intentionally failed to do so.

17:04.397 --> 17:07.299

for the kind that plants a bomb

to take some half-assed deal.

20:32.740 --> 20:34.206
Now who's the moron?

20:34.208 --> 20:36.608
Well, that would still be you.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.945
(chuckles softly)

20:42.049 --> 20:44.249
GUARD:
Let's go.

20:50.658 --> 20:53.625
He may be psychotic,
but he happens to be right--

20:53.627 --> 20:55.327
we have nothing.

20:55.329 --> 20:58.030
Come on, there's got to be
something you can do.

20:58.032 --> 21:00.766
I have an obligation
to advise the D.A.

21:00.768 --> 21:02.801
that we have
insufficient evidence

21:02.803 --> 21:04.603
to proceed with a new trial.

21:04.605 --> 21:06.738
I am sorry, Danny.

21:07.608 --> 21:09.775
(sighs)

21:22.039 --> 21:23.672
Push people too far,
they push back.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.267
That was one hell of a scene
there at Veterans Plaza.

21:26.269 --> 21:28.469
Why would anyone want
to burn the American flag?

21:28.471 --> 21:30.571
They do it all the time
in the Middle East.

21:30.573 --> 21:32.273
It's one thing when it
happens overseas, boys,

21:32.275 --> 21:36.077
but when an American lights
a match in our own backyard...

21:36.079 --> 21:37.578
Amen to that.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.480
Maybe a lot of people disagree
with our foreign policy.

21:39.482 --> 21:40.981
DANNY: Or maybe they're just
a bunch of ungrateful

21:40.983 --> 21:42.850
knuckleheads who
have no respect.

21:42.852 --> 21:45.119
They're entitled
to their point of view, Danny.

21:45.121 --> 21:46.587
That's all I'm saying.
The fact remains

21:46.589 --> 21:49.323
burning the flag is protected
under the First Amendment.

21:49.325 --> 21:50.958
No one disputes that.
DANNY: I do.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.827
I fought under that flag.
Just like Dad,

21:52.829 --> 21:54.662
just like Grandpa.
As far as I'm concerned,

21:54.664 --> 21:56.363
you want to burn it,
you don't love this country,

21:56.365 --> 21:58.065
get the hell out.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.366
It's not that simple, Danny.

21:59.368 --> 22:01.569
Oh, now we got to hear
from the golden boy

22:01.571 --> 22:03.704
who never even
wore a uniform?

22:03.706 --> 22:05.840
I wear one now, and no one
respects what the flag

22:05.842 --> 22:07.041
stands for more than I do.

22:07.043 --> 22:08.743
You know what, then
I'll tell you what.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.679
Hop on an airplane,
go to some godforsaken hellhole,

22:11.681 --> 22:13.781
and watch all your buddies
get blown away, then talk to us

22:13.783 --> 22:15.549
about what the flag stands for.
HENRY: Hey.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.918
Let's keep it civilized, okay?

22:17.920 --> 22:20.087
ERIN: Look, everyone at
this table respects

22:20.089 --> 22:22.289
your service,
but when you defend the flag,

22:22.291 --> 22:24.892
you defend all the rights
it stands for.

22:24.894 --> 22:26.727
Especially the rights of
the people you disagree with.

22:26.729 --> 22:28.095
FRANK: But just because you have
the right to do something

22:28.097 --> 22:30.564
doesn't mean
it's the right thing to do.

22:30.566 --> 22:31.966
HENRY: Especially when
you're dishonoring

22:31.968 --> 22:34.335
the people who died
for your freedom.

22:34.337 --> 22:35.636
Exactly.

22:35.638 --> 22:36.871
No one said it's right.

22:36.873 --> 22:38.272
ERIN: Well, you start
limiting freedoms

22:38.274 --> 22:40.908
so no one's offended,
and soon we won't have any.

22:40.910 --> 22:44.044
Burning the flag is shameful,
but it's legal.

22:44.046 --> 22:45.112
SEAN:
What do you do

22:45.114 --> 22:46.580
when it's both, Grandpa?

22:48.384 --> 22:51.585
Your job.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.826
DANNY:
<i>All right, guys.</i>

22:58.828 --> 23:01.796
Time to go. Come on.

23:02.932 --> 23:04.331
Actually, meet me
in the car, okay?

23:04.333 --> 23:05.966
All right.
Hey.

23:05.968 --> 23:06.934
Anything new

23:06.936 --> 23:08.402
on the Donovan case?
I presented

23:08.404 --> 23:09.970
the facts to the D.A.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.005
And?

23:11.007 --> 23:13.474
He told me to drop the charges.

23:13.476 --> 23:16.110
Come on. You can't do that.

23:16.112 --> 23:18.546
Danny, even if we go to trial,
we have no case.

23:18.548 --> 23:20.848
I'll make a case. Just
give me a little time.

23:20.850 --> 23:23.484
Donovan spent seven years
in jail

23:23.486 --> 23:25.452
because a cop broke the law.

23:25.454 --> 23:27.955
No. He spent seven years in jail

23:27.957 --> 23:31.158
because he murdered
Joe and Janet Campanella.

23:32.195 --> 23:34.128
Married 47 years.

23:34.130 --> 23:35.229
Four children.

23:35.231 --> 23:37.498
Seven grandchildren.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.800
You don't play fair.

23:39.802 --> 23:41.302
Just 48 hours.

23:41.304 --> 23:43.437
Can you give me 48 hours,
please?

23:43.439 --> 23:45.306
I will get you the
proof you need,

23:45.308 --> 23:48.876
and if I don't, you drop the
charges against Donovan, okay?

23:48.878 --> 23:52.079
48 hours.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.450
(sighs)

23:59.288 --> 24:01.088
She could be anywhere.

24:01.090 --> 24:02.723
Hopefully she stuck
around her neighborhood.

24:02.725 --> 24:04.658
Has Lily ever run away
before?

24:04.660 --> 24:06.694
Grandmother said
this is the first time.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.529
Guess that's on me.

24:08.531 --> 24:09.864
Jamie.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.298
Right there.

24:23.012 --> 24:24.812
Lily.

24:26.515 --> 24:28.048
Hey, what are you doing
out here?

24:29.919 --> 24:31.952
I'm fine, okay?

24:31.954 --> 24:34.822
Let us take you home.
No.

24:34.824 --> 24:37.124
This is where I want to be.

24:37.126 --> 24:38.826
Look, I'm sorry
that I said that stuff

24:38.828 --> 24:41.695
about your father, Lily.
I-I had no right.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.197
If I knew that...

24:43.199 --> 24:46.166
It's not like I haven't heard
bad stuff about him before.

24:46.168 --> 24:51.438
I guess it was just...
easier not to believe it.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.909
What he did, that's not
on you-- that's on him.

24:54.911 --> 24:58.512
He could be really sweet,
you know?

25:01.517 --> 25:04.752
He'd cook me breakfast.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.554
Then we'd watch TV.

25:07.556 --> 25:10.457
<i>The Three Stooges.</i>

25:10.459 --> 25:13.093
We'd laugh
until our stomachs hurt.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.696
It's good you have
those memories.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.400
I haven't been happy like that
since he died.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.039
Mostly, just...

25:25.041 --> 25:27.908
tired.

25:27.910 --> 25:30.611
Tired of being mad all the time.

25:34.917 --> 25:37.351
Tired of missing him.

25:39.922 --> 25:43.424
There's people who can help you,
Lily, if you let them.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.896
Can they bring my dad back?

25:50.633 --> 25:53.600
No. I wish they could.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.777
Come on.

26:16.759 --> 26:19.026
(rock music playing,
quiet chatter)

26:20.730 --> 26:22.396
Eddie.

26:23.766 --> 26:25.632
Shot for my pal.
I'm okay.

26:25.634 --> 26:30.704
Looks like the D.A.'s not gonna
get Marcus Donovan a new trial.

26:30.706 --> 26:32.539
Figures.

26:32.541 --> 26:35.009
I got two days to come up
with anything I can

26:35.011 --> 26:37.544
that'll keep that mutt
behind bars.

26:37.546 --> 26:39.413
I really need your help.

26:40.950 --> 26:42.416
You're on your own.

26:42.418 --> 26:44.752
Nobody knows this
case as good as you.

26:44.754 --> 26:48.422
Truth is I really don't care
if Donovan walks or not.

26:48.424 --> 26:50.124
You're still a cop.

26:50.126 --> 26:52.026
Actually, I'm not.

26:54.263 --> 26:57.564
They took my gun and my shield
this morning.

26:59.502 --> 27:01.335
(exhales)
I'm sorry.

27:01.337 --> 27:03.237
And I'm facing felony time.

27:05.174 --> 27:08.876
Donovan gets to walk out of the
jail the same time I walk in?

27:08.878 --> 27:11.278
(exhales)

27:11.280 --> 27:13.981
You could still do some good
right now.

27:13.983 --> 27:15.549
Do some good?

27:15.551 --> 27:17.951
I spent my entire career
doing good.

27:17.953 --> 27:20.454
I put my ass on the line
every day.

27:20.456 --> 27:21.922
And what do
I get for it?

27:21.924 --> 27:26.660
A “screw you” from
the department and a jail cell.

27:26.662 --> 27:29.471
You still got a choice
to make right now.

27:29.495 --> 27:30.031
Yeah.

27:30.032 --> 27:34.368
And now Donovan and every other
scumbag murderer in this city--

27:34.370 --> 27:36.670
it's no longer my problem.

27:37.506 --> 27:39.540
I'm done.

27:49.452 --> 27:51.318
GARRETT: The new Battle
for Peace rally

27:51.320 --> 27:53.020
is scheduled
for tomorrow at 2:00.

27:53.022 --> 27:54.054
Some people never learn.

27:54.056 --> 27:55.589
I want our manpower doubled.

27:55.591 --> 27:56.857
And after
what happened

27:56.859 --> 27:59.593
last time, the media
is gonna be all over this.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.495
David Gore
is on TV claiming

28:01.497 --> 28:04.031
the NYPD didn't protect
his people.

28:04.033 --> 28:05.699
Any truth to that?

28:05.701 --> 28:07.067
Spoke to the Borough
Inspections Unit.

28:07.069 --> 28:09.369
They got no evidence of our guys
sitting on their hands,

28:09.371 --> 28:11.171
though I sure as hell
wouldn't blame 'em.

28:11.173 --> 28:12.372
What about IAB?

28:12.374 --> 28:14.842
I didn't see any reason
to drag 'em into it.

28:14.844 --> 28:16.510
If there are officers
who stood down,

28:16.512 --> 28:17.845
I want them disciplined.

28:17.847 --> 28:19.580
And we sure as hell don't want
'em out there tomorrow.

28:19.582 --> 28:21.849
Make the notification to IAB.

28:21.851 --> 28:22.916
Yes, sir.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.351
I want the counterprotesters
contained.

28:24.353 --> 28:26.053
Put some undercovers
in their ranks.

28:26.055 --> 28:27.621
And you run the operation.

28:27.623 --> 28:30.624
I'll take a pass on that,
if it's okay.

28:34.396 --> 28:37.631
Boss, I lost a grandfather,
two uncles

28:37.633 --> 28:40.434
and more friends than
I can count serving that flag.

28:40.436 --> 28:42.469
I still carry
shrapnel in my hip.

28:42.471 --> 28:43.804
These people
deserve

28:43.806 --> 28:45.405
what they get, if you ask me.

28:45.407 --> 28:46.907
I didn't ask.

28:46.909 --> 28:48.308
It's not a request.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.110
I just can't stand by
and watch 'em

28:50.112 --> 28:52.446
torch the flag.
It's an order.

28:53.716 --> 28:56.750
Maybe we should take it down
a notch, guys.

29:07.463 --> 29:09.696
Really appreciate you coming
in here, Mr. Tavares.

29:09.698 --> 29:11.498
Sure. I just don't know
how I can help you.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.800
I think you can help me.
Why don't you take a seat.

29:15.171 --> 29:18.238
Now, you were working
security at the pharmacy

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
across the street from
where the Campanellas

29:20.242 --> 29:22.976
were shot and killed
seven years ago. Is that right?

29:22.978 --> 29:25.445
Yeah. But like I told
the detective back then,

29:25.447 --> 29:28.315
I didn't see those people
get shot.

29:28.317 --> 29:30.083
Yeah. I-I read your statement.

29:30.085 --> 29:32.753
See, here's the thing,
Mr. Tavares,

29:32.755 --> 29:34.521
is that the guy

29:34.523 --> 29:36.723
who killed those people,
who we put away

29:36.725 --> 29:38.792
for the rest of his life,
he's gonna be set free

29:38.794 --> 29:41.128
if we can't find someone
who can I.D. him as the shooter.

29:41.130 --> 29:42.563
So that's where you come in.

29:42.565 --> 29:45.098
I'm sorry to hear that.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.968
Really.
But I didn't see anything.

29:47.970 --> 29:50.604
Well, it's funny, 'cause I spoke
to all the other employees

29:50.606 --> 29:53.740
who were working that night,
and they said you were outside,

29:53.742 --> 29:57.477
in front of the pharmacy,
at the time of the shooting.

29:58.647 --> 30:00.647
So I think
you did see something.

30:02.484 --> 30:03.717
Hmm?

30:04.553 --> 30:06.553
Marcus Donovan...

30:06.555 --> 30:08.322
he's crazy.

30:08.324 --> 30:11.658
Him and his friends terrorized
that neighborhood for years.

30:11.660 --> 30:13.727
And they hurt a lot of people.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.495
That's why no one

30:15.497 --> 30:20.167
testified against him back then.

30:20.169 --> 30:23.303
And that's why no one's
gonna testify against him now.

30:23.305 --> 30:25.973
You're telling me
that you saw that animal

30:25.975 --> 30:27.774
shoot those people in cold blood

30:27.776 --> 30:29.576
and you don't have the stones
to come forward,

30:29.578 --> 30:31.912
even after all these years,
and do the right thing?

30:33.082 --> 30:36.917
I'm saying,
unless I'm under arrest,

30:36.919 --> 30:39.553
I'm going home.

30:54.610 --> 30:55.942
DANNY:
Come on, help me out.

30:55.944 --> 30:57.344
I'm on the clock
here, all right?

30:57.346 --> 30:58.612
Just run the physical
evidence again.

30:58.614 --> 31:01.314
I'm looking for fingerprints,
DNA, anything.

31:01.316 --> 31:02.782
Oh, you're too busy?

31:02.784 --> 31:05.051
Is that right?
Okay, I'll tell you what.

31:05.053 --> 31:06.586
When this murdering prick
gets out of the joint

31:06.588 --> 31:10.156
looking for a new victim, I'll
be sure he gets your address.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.892
You been here all night?

31:12.894 --> 31:15.195
A lot of good it's done.

31:15.197 --> 31:18.598
This is Reid's mess, Danny.
It's not yours.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.034
You can tell that
to his next victim's family.

31:21.036 --> 31:23.737
Detective Reegan?

31:23.739 --> 31:25.405
It's Reagan.

31:25.407 --> 31:27.974
And what do you want,
Mr. Tavares?

31:27.976 --> 31:29.609
I-I've been thinking,

31:29.611 --> 31:31.344
about the night
that couple got killed.

31:31.346 --> 31:34.648
Oh, I've been thinking
about it, too. Believe me.

31:36.985 --> 31:38.685
I'll testify.

31:44.893 --> 31:46.393
What did you say?

31:46.395 --> 31:48.328
I'll testify.

31:51.266 --> 31:53.633
Great.

31:53.635 --> 31:55.301
What made you change your mind?

31:56.605 --> 31:58.705
It's like you said, I...

31:58.707 --> 32:01.474
Sometimes you just
got to stand up and...

32:01.476 --> 32:03.743
do the right thing.

32:06.415 --> 32:09.349
Well, you're doing
the right thing.

32:09.351 --> 32:11.017
Would you take
his statement, please?

32:11.019 --> 32:12.952
Get it to me
in an envelope right away.

32:12.954 --> 32:14.554
Sure. Is everything okay?

32:14.556 --> 32:16.489
That's what I'm gonna find out.

32:16.491 --> 32:19.159
My partner will take
your statement, okay?

32:19.161 --> 32:21.327
Follow her.

32:27.803 --> 32:29.102
Sorry I'm late.

32:30.539 --> 32:32.439
Meeting with my lawyer.

32:32.441 --> 32:34.607
You remember Reuben Tavares?

32:34.609 --> 32:37.043
Hum a few bars.
He worked security

32:37.045 --> 32:39.913
across the street from where
the murders took place.

32:41.349 --> 32:42.482
Yeah, so?

32:42.484 --> 32:44.350
I re-interviewed him last night.

32:44.352 --> 32:46.152
Stuck to the
same old story.

32:46.154 --> 32:48.788
Says he didn't see anything
the night of the murders.

32:48.790 --> 32:51.057
This going somewhere, Danny?

32:51.059 --> 32:54.394
He just showed up
back at the squad an hour ago.

32:54.396 --> 32:55.862
Changing his whole tune.

32:55.864 --> 32:57.731
Talking about how he wants
to put his hand on the Bible

32:57.733 --> 33:01.401
and swear that he saw Marcus
Donovan murder that couple.

33:01.403 --> 33:04.137
Something you said
must've gotten to him.

33:04.139 --> 33:06.272
Well, see, I think something
somebody else said

33:06.274 --> 33:08.708
might have gotten to him.

33:08.710 --> 33:10.777
Either way, you make the case.

33:10.779 --> 33:12.679
Congrats.

33:12.681 --> 33:16.082
Guys like Tavares
do not get brave overnight.

33:19.020 --> 33:23.022
Do you believe Tavares
saw Donovan kill those people?

33:23.024 --> 33:24.991
Absolutely.

33:24.993 --> 33:26.760
Then take a yes, all right?

33:26.762 --> 33:28.695
You wanted Donovan,
you got him. Walk away.

33:28.697 --> 33:32.465
Did you threaten Tavares,
make him change his story?

33:32.467 --> 33:34.901
You came to me...

33:36.705 --> 33:37.837
...the day my career ended.

33:37.839 --> 33:39.372
Asked for my help
making this case.

33:39.374 --> 33:40.707
Now you want to point fingers?

33:40.709 --> 33:41.875
Tavares wouldn't testify

33:41.877 --> 33:43.510
because he was scared stiff
of Donovan.

33:43.512 --> 33:45.945
Now he wants to testify.
Why?

33:45.947 --> 33:48.481
Because he's scared stiff
of somebody else.

33:49.351 --> 33:51.384
Let's just say

33:51.386 --> 33:53.820
I gave Tavares a come-to-Jesus.

33:53.822 --> 33:55.388
And I'm not saying I did.

33:56.591 --> 33:58.491
You got no knowledge.

33:58.493 --> 34:00.660
Your hands are clean.

34:02.197 --> 34:05.999
Now, you got Marcus Donovan
by the throat, Danny.

34:06.001 --> 34:09.168
All you have to do now
is squeeze.

34:23.918 --> 34:25.552
Hi, Lily.

34:26.388 --> 34:28.288
Glad to see you
back in school.

34:28.290 --> 34:30.657
My grandmother was having
a nervous breakdown,

34:30.659 --> 34:32.559
so I came.

34:32.561 --> 34:34.527
But it's only temporary.

34:34.529 --> 34:36.663
Well, what does that mean?

34:36.665 --> 34:38.331
It means I'm out of here.

34:39.868 --> 34:41.868
Got some money stashed.

34:41.870 --> 34:45.371
Heading to Florida,
maybe California.

34:45.373 --> 34:47.774
You're 13, Lily.
If you take off,

34:47.775 --> 34:49.641
that makes you a runaway. The
authorities will track you down,

34:49.643 --> 34:50.877
bring you back.

34:50.879 --> 34:53.847
And I'll run away again.

34:53.849 --> 34:55.949
You can't run away
from your problems, Lily.

34:55.951 --> 34:58.451
Which is why you really need
to talk to someone.

34:58.453 --> 35:02.422
My whole life changed
the night my dad died.

35:03.558 --> 35:05.925
Who can I talk to about that?

35:19.975 --> 35:21.841
Hi, Lily. My name's Chris.

35:23.578 --> 35:26.279
Officer Chris Frye.
You-you know who I am?

35:28.083 --> 35:29.849
What the hell is this?

35:29.851 --> 35:32.085
Take it easy, Lily. He's got
something he wants to say.

35:32.087 --> 35:33.553
CHRIS: I've wanted
to reach out

35:33.555 --> 35:35.221
to you a thousand times,
but I knew that

35:35.223 --> 35:36.990
nothing I could say
would make a difference.

35:36.992 --> 35:38.658
You're right.

35:39.694 --> 35:41.394
You killed my dad.
You ruined my life.

35:41.396 --> 35:43.196
Lily.
Hear him out, Lily.

35:43.198 --> 35:45.832
Listen, I know
you must hate me.

35:45.834 --> 35:49.068
Even though I did my job,
I hated myself for a long time.

35:55.110 --> 35:57.644
So I'm supposed to feel
sorry for you?

35:57.646 --> 35:59.879
No.

35:59.881 --> 36:01.748
I've done enough of that myself.

36:03.451 --> 36:05.485
Listen, Lily...

36:05.487 --> 36:08.288
I lost something, too,
that night, okay?

36:11.092 --> 36:13.459
It's nothing
compared to what you lost.

36:13.461 --> 36:15.628
But it was enough...

36:17.265 --> 36:19.766
to make me
not want to live anymore.

36:21.536 --> 36:24.037
Chris got help, Lily.

36:24.039 --> 36:25.738
You can, too.

36:32.614 --> 36:34.614
I work at New Tomorrow
Youth Center now.

36:34.616 --> 36:38.718
People deal with problems
like this every day.

36:40.255 --> 36:42.956
If you let them,
I think they can help you, Lily.

36:56.938 --> 36:59.105
I'm sorry about your dad, Lily.

37:39.447 --> 37:41.114
(clears throat softly)

37:42.951 --> 37:45.284
47 hours and 36 minutes.

37:45.286 --> 37:47.687
You're cutting it
a little close, Detective.

37:47.689 --> 37:50.556
Tough case.
This is the motion

37:50.558 --> 37:53.960
to dismiss the murder charges
against Marcus Donovan.

37:53.962 --> 37:55.928
You have any reason
why I shouldn't file it?

37:55.930 --> 37:58.297
Yeah, 'cause
he's a murdering scumbag.

37:59.134 --> 38:01.634
Any reason I can use in court?

38:02.504 --> 38:04.404
(clears throat)

38:06.241 --> 38:08.408
(sighs)

38:10.211 --> 38:14.781
I keep...
I keep thinking about Reid

38:14.783 --> 38:17.550
planting that blood on Donovan.

38:18.420 --> 38:20.753
He broke the law, Danny.

38:21.589 --> 38:23.156
Yeah.

38:23.158 --> 38:25.658
But I know why he did.

38:27.495 --> 38:31.397
I mean, I've crossed the line
plenty of times myself.

38:31.399 --> 38:34.000
It's part of the job, you know?

38:35.703 --> 38:39.005
Yeah, but there's a line

38:39.007 --> 38:41.207
that you don't cross.

38:42.844 --> 38:44.410
(short chuckle)

38:45.980 --> 38:48.948
Reid must've thought
to himself,

38:48.950 --> 38:53.052
“Do I want a clear conscience,

38:53.054 --> 38:57.023
or do I want an innocent
victim's blood on my hands?”

38:57.892 --> 38:59.792
What's going on, Danny?

38:59.794 --> 39:01.961
(sighs)

39:09.737 --> 39:11.904
I came up empty.

39:16.945 --> 39:18.578
I'm sorry.

39:18.580 --> 39:20.813
I know this was
important to you.

39:20.815 --> 39:22.582
(soft chuckle)

39:22.584 --> 39:24.484
I cannot believe
that son of a bitch

39:24.486 --> 39:26.452
is gonna be out on the street.

39:26.454 --> 39:28.187
He's gonna screw up again.

39:28.189 --> 39:29.789
He's gonna be right back here.

39:29.791 --> 39:31.257
It's just a matter of time.

39:31.259 --> 39:34.727
Well, I hope no one has to die
because of it.

39:40.635 --> 39:43.236
There something
you're not telling me?

39:46.474 --> 39:48.841
Doesn't matter anymore.

39:51.513 --> 39:53.980
You okay?

39:53.982 --> 39:56.582
Sure, I am.

39:56.584 --> 39:59.385
You're a lousy liar.

39:59.387 --> 40:01.587
(soft chuckle)

40:03.191 --> 40:06.225
I could use a drink.
You?

40:09.297 --> 40:11.497
Yeah.

40:31.352 --> 40:33.753
Lieutenant Gormley
to see you, sir.

40:35.857 --> 40:37.557
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

40:39.327 --> 40:40.893
Really?

40:40.895 --> 40:42.862
We had the counterprotesters
under control.

40:42.864 --> 40:45.698
Battle for Peaceniks
had the place for themselves.

40:45.700 --> 40:46.899
And they walked away.

40:46.901 --> 40:48.901
They never even
lit the match.

40:48.903 --> 40:50.503
Sounds like a happy ending.

40:50.505 --> 40:51.804
Yeah.

40:51.806 --> 40:53.472
You know, but I keep
asking myself,

40:53.474 --> 40:55.308
why would they back down?

40:55.310 --> 40:57.977
Well, you'd have to ask them.
You changed the venue.

40:57.979 --> 41:00.413
You went from
the Veteran Memorial

41:00.415 --> 41:02.748
to the Oakdale
National Cemetery.

41:02.750 --> 41:04.450
Well, there were
security issues,

41:04.452 --> 41:05.818
traffic concerns.

41:05.820 --> 41:07.153
Sometimes you just get lucky.

41:07.155 --> 41:10.156
All due respect,
that's a load of crap.

41:11.292 --> 41:12.825
Sir.

41:14.329 --> 41:15.795
Well, not that I owe you

41:15.797 --> 41:17.830
an explanation, Lieutenant,

41:17.832 --> 41:19.832
but David Gore's father

41:19.834 --> 41:22.768
was KIA in Iraq.

41:22.770 --> 41:25.104
He's buried in Oakdale.

41:25.106 --> 41:27.807
Oh. And you knew the kid

41:27.809 --> 41:31.143
couldn't burn a flag
on his father's grave.

41:33.548 --> 41:35.948
That was my hope.

41:35.950 --> 41:38.517
Guess that's why you're on
that side of the desk.

41:38.519 --> 41:40.486
Just wanted you
to know--

41:40.488 --> 41:41.988
me fighting the assignment

41:41.990 --> 41:44.757
wasn't out of any
disrespect for you.

41:44.759 --> 41:46.692
I know that, Sid.

41:46.694 --> 41:48.728
You served proudly.

41:48.730 --> 41:51.998
Your family sacrificed
more than their share.

41:54.469 --> 41:56.669
But what we do here...

41:58.940 --> 42:01.140
...is no less sacred.
