GIVE YOU YOUNG PEOPLE

15:53.285 --> 15:54.369
A SENSE OF MATURITY,

15:54.536 --> 15:55.745
BUT IT WOULD BE
A FALSE MATURITY.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.538
AND THAT
WOULD BE WRONG.

THAT WAY, IT WILL
LEAVE A RING.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.070

YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.331
OH, KITTY, WHEN VALERIE
WENT OFF TO SCHOOL,

18:45.499 --> 18:46.415
I FELT THE SAME WAY.

18:46.583 --> 18:51.129
BUT THIS LITTLE BOOK
OF POEMS HELPED ME.

18:51.296 --> 18:55.174
IT'S CALLED
VERSES FROM AN EMPTY NEST.

18:55.342 --> 18:55.883

DON'T EVEN THINK IT.

19:31.670 --> 19:35.339
NOW, WHEN HE OPENS IT,
HE'LL SAY, "COOL"

19:35.507 --> 19:36.382
OR SOMETHING.

19:36.550 --> 19:42.430
AND THEN YOU GIVE HIM
A LOOK LIKE THIS...
