01:02.140 --> 01:03.410
Hello.

01:14.735 --> 01:16.735
Can you give me a minute?

01:17.100 --> 01:18.860
Yeah, all right.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.160
Have you brought me a prezzie?

01:28.900 --> 01:30.802
You look great.

01:30.828 --> 01:32.868
So do you. Well...

01:34.900 --> 01:37.530
Where did you get that
two-headed confidence monster?

01:37.580 --> 01:39.250
Oh, she's great, Anna.

01:39.501 --> 01:40.532
Is she?

01:40.558 --> 01:41.915
Rachel?

01:41.941 --> 01:43.529
Yeah.
- I thought so.

01:43.555 --> 01:48.051
Hi.
- I just called you. Janet's out on a shout in Hulme... a knifing.

01:48.077 --> 01:49.959
She said I should take you
down when you got in.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.735
She wasn't sure what time it'd be.

01:52.186 --> 01:54.186
Late night?

01:54.374 --> 01:56.044
Sorry, I'm sat here.

01:57.094 --> 01:59.034
I'll be back in minute.

02:00.838 --> 02:03.954
So, London. How was it?

02:10.900 --> 02:13.330
Yeah, it was great, you know?

02:13.380 --> 02:15.170
Hello, stranger.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.560
Put on weight? We need to get on.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.390
Nice to see you, too, Mary.

02:21.440 --> 02:24.350
We've got a Michael Edgerton in there. 24.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.310
He was opening up around 6:30,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.230
bloke comes out of nowhere

02:28.280 --> 02:30.061
attacks him... stabs him in the back.

02:30.087 --> 02:32.421
He died on the spot. His
girlfriend witnessed it.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.630
Would you mind getting her first account?

02:34.680 --> 02:35.950
Erm...

02:37.049 --> 02:39.169
Sure. Who's SIO?

02:39.558 --> 02:41.268
Gill wasn't replaced... cuts.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.590
So we get different SIO cover from
the other syndicates, case by case.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.190
Depends who's busy, and
this morning everyone was.

02:48.240 --> 02:53.560
So while they decide, we just do
what we do until someone says stop.

03:08.425 --> 03:10.135
It's my fault.

03:10.889 --> 03:13.159
Why would you think that, Wendy?

03:13.896 --> 03:16.236
We were arguing when it happened.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.680
OK.

03:19.634 --> 03:23.234
Wendy, what can you tell me
about the person that did this?

03:24.921 --> 03:27.231
When he came into the yard,

03:27.257 --> 03:29.607
I thought he'd come in
cos he'd heard us arguing.

03:29.633 --> 03:31.743
I thought he'd come in to help.

03:31.944 --> 03:33.572
But he just...

03:33.598 --> 03:36.468
he just walked straight
up behind Mikey...

03:38.208 --> 03:40.478
and stabbed him in the back.

03:40.555 --> 03:42.265
How would you describe him?

03:42.291 --> 03:44.517
Clothes? Height? Race?

03:45.040 --> 03:46.880
I couldn't see him.

03:48.047 --> 03:49.997
He had a black hoodie on and,

03:50.250 --> 03:52.450
like, a scarf across his face.

03:52.906 --> 03:55.376
And he was white. Taller than me.

03:55.970 --> 03:56.990
Good.

03:57.742 --> 03:59.710
Can you tell me anything about the hoodie?

03:59.736 --> 04:03.812
It had a bloke running on the
back. It was a black outline.

04:05.307 --> 04:07.227
Anything else?

04:08.640 --> 04:10.390
He was wearing blue gloves,

04:10.440 --> 04:12.640
like a nurse or a dinner lady.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.080
Did he say anything?

04:18.069 --> 04:21.629
He went to the gate and touched
the wall. I don't know why.

04:23.203 --> 04:25.073
Then he turned back to us.

04:25.570 --> 04:27.750
I thought he was coming back for me.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.176
But he didn't.

04:31.478 --> 04:34.238
He got his phone out and took a picture.

04:35.130 --> 04:38.360
I couldn't scream for help. I didn't
know what he was going to do next,

04:38.386 --> 04:40.386
or I would have screamed.

04:41.962 --> 04:44.032
He just stood

04:44.200 --> 04:46.540
and took a picture on his phone...

04:48.924 --> 04:51.284
watching Mikey die.

05:01.803 --> 05:03.713
Why come out here to take a photo?

05:04.182 --> 05:05.790
Why not be closer in?

05:05.932 --> 05:07.750
Getting distance for safety?

05:07.971 --> 05:11.411
No, he's getting a clear view and Wendy
could call for help at any moment.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.510
So he's taking photos for what?

05:13.872 --> 05:15.592
Evidence? Proof?

05:17.031 --> 05:18.358
Was this a professional hit?

05:18.400 --> 05:20.630
Ten minutes in Vice and
everyone's a Triad.

05:21.282 --> 05:22.550
Stiletto blade?

05:22.763 --> 05:26.403
Quick, clean, no blood
spatter, no trail...

05:27.340 --> 05:29.770
Saw a lot of it in Vice. Just saying.

05:29.820 --> 05:32.050
Can we make sure we get
some shots of this?

05:32.437 --> 05:34.427
I've just had an interesting statement.

05:34.453 --> 05:37.443
Suspicious man running, a few streets
away, at the time of the murder.

05:37.469 --> 05:40.839
Witness described him as wearing a black
hoodie with a running motif on the back.

05:40.865 --> 05:43.579
Said he got into a car. They could
only give us the colour of the car,

05:43.605 --> 05:45.490
but they did get a
partial number plate.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.490
And he remembers it was a left-hand drive.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.570
Did you get the witness's
name and address?

05:50.598 --> 05:51.642
He didn't want to give it.

05:51.668 --> 05:55.140
Get POLSA to check the road where
the witness saw the suspect.

05:56.207 --> 05:59.290
Yeah, and can you run the partial
number plates through the DVLA?

05:59.340 --> 06:01.210
Left-hand drive should narrow it down.

06:01.606 --> 06:02.656
Sure.

06:03.894 --> 06:05.585
Oh...

06:08.342 --> 06:12.980
You only popped out for a pint of milk and you
were gone for a year. Thought you'd forgotten us.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.314
No! I've missed you lot.

06:15.269 --> 06:16.690
And all of this.

06:16.940 --> 06:20.730
Though I've got our Alison and the
kids at the flat. Tony trouble.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.472
You should see the state of the place.

06:23.498 --> 06:26.594
Got weeping angels and
wooden ducks everywhere,

06:26.620 --> 06:28.960
which she's bought me as a thanks.

06:29.938 --> 06:32.530
The flat reeks of air freshener.
She's got six different stinks.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.930
Woke up the other day,
thought I'd been embalmed.

06:34.980 --> 06:37.130
So, when DID you get back?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.410
Er... Thursday.

06:45.724 --> 06:48.754
We've got a mother and son with a
website, wanting to talk to you.

06:48.780 --> 06:50.091
First nutters of the day?

06:50.117 --> 06:52.657
They're on a video link from Australia.

06:55.704 --> 06:57.774
He's seen this website.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.390
He was too scared to show it
me. It was on the darknet.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.179
He's not going to get into
trouble for looking at it, is he?

07:03.205 --> 07:06.675
It's not illegal to access the
darknet. What did you see, Maurice?

07:07.192 --> 07:09.752
I was messing a couple of weeks ago.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.870
I ended up at this page with a password,

07:13.650 --> 07:15.486
so I thought I'd see if
I could hack into it.

07:15.512 --> 07:18.022
It had this map of back home on it,

07:19.065 --> 07:23.230
with all these sick pictures and
videos... dead bodies and stuff.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.480
We're gonna need the password.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.310
I didn't know he was
doing any of it.

07:28.360 --> 07:33.200
One of his mate's Whatsapped him this morning 'cos
of a murder that happened near his old school.

07:34.991 --> 07:37.501
I saw him on the website.
- Michael Edgerton?

07:37.845 --> 07:40.755
Yeah, his murder was posted
a couple of hours ago.

07:40.914 --> 07:43.054
I watched him bleed to death.

07:44.182 --> 07:46.322
What was the website called?

07:48.247 --> 07:51.177
Taking Out The Trash.
- Charming.

07:51.419 --> 07:54.300
We'll have to ring Special
Branch to even use the password.

07:54.557 --> 07:58.779
Some 14-year-old on the other side of the world can
access it, but we have to ask if we're allowed.

07:58.805 --> 08:00.990
No, we don't. I've got
permissions already.

08:01.241 --> 08:04.490
I did the course on my secondment.
Got the software on here.

08:04.540 --> 08:07.080
You couldn't wire a plug 12 months ago.

08:07.352 --> 08:10.512
The software's shit slow because
it bounces info around the globe.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.874
It's how it keeps the
darknet users secret.

08:15.368 --> 08:17.088
Here we go.

08:21.744 --> 08:24.144
This is where we were this morning.

08:24.806 --> 08:26.636
That's Wendy.

08:26.749 --> 08:29.219
Jesus, he was filming Michael dying.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.513
We now believe Michael Edgerton's murder

08:37.539 --> 08:39.609
is linked to several other cases.

08:40.216 --> 08:42.808
As Syndicate 9 has no dedicated DCI,

08:42.835 --> 08:45.724
it makes sense to take
advantage of Rachel's return.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.318
Eh-up. If it ain't Mary Poppins!

08:50.424 --> 08:53.812
So we're appointing her as
Acting Detective Inspector

08:53.838 --> 08:56.425
for the initial stages
of the investigation.

08:56.621 --> 08:58.570
I hope you'll give her your full support.

08:59.119 --> 09:00.799
Thank you.

09:01.743 --> 09:03.893
Be ready to brief a
Gold meeting at 12:00.

09:04.060 --> 09:06.600
And... don't come dressed
like Little Mix.

09:11.247 --> 09:14.527
Nice entrance, you knobhead.
- I didn't know.

09:15.768 --> 09:18.246
Nice to see London hasn't
changed you, you chippy cow.

09:18.272 --> 09:20.290
You can't talk to her like
that, she's the boss.

09:20.340 --> 09:22.170
You could never talk to her like that.

09:22.220 --> 09:25.040
No, you couldn't. So wind
your neck in, chunky.

09:25.886 --> 09:28.461
Does Dodson know what she's
unleashed, leaving you in charge?

09:28.487 --> 09:30.508
Godzilla, the next generation.

09:31.094 --> 09:32.402
Godzuki.

09:33.879 --> 09:35.560
The bitch is back.

09:40.027 --> 09:43.784
OK, well, we'll do a full briefing later
on, but this is what we've got so far.

09:44.316 --> 09:47.930
We've got a web page, which people
are accessing via the darknet.

09:48.262 --> 09:50.810
You go on to the site and you
get a map of Greater Manchester.

09:50.860 --> 09:53.097
As you can see, it's
covered in these icons.

09:53.123 --> 09:55.592
Click on an icon and it
takes you to either an image

09:55.618 --> 09:59.592
or a video of a murder scene,
or a victim's home address.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.790
This is Michael Edgerton's home.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.180
He's not the only person on there.

10:10.003 --> 10:12.143
They're all unsolved murders.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.679
This is Richard Hazelmere.

10:16.705 --> 10:18.655
The drug addict we found in China Town?

10:18.767 --> 10:22.092
That would be five, six years ago.
- No, it was seven.

10:22.365 --> 10:24.870
Can you all be aware this
next clip is pretty full-on.

10:49.492 --> 10:51.452
Are we all OK?

10:51.717 --> 10:56.186
So, the perpetrator draws a
chalk star at the murder scene.

10:56.451 --> 11:00.438
This one, you'd mistake for graffiti.
That's if you noticed it at all.

11:01.298 --> 11:04.270
These chalk stars appear
at all of our crime scenes.

11:04.850 --> 11:07.256
It's just that we hadn't
spotted them previously.

11:07.980 --> 11:11.940
They also appear at all of
our victims' home addresses,

11:13.533 --> 11:15.723
this one being Michael Edgerton's.

11:16.321 --> 11:19.172
There's a discussion page on
the website, which is encrypted.

11:19.364 --> 11:23.394
I've got people over at SCAS going through
it to try and can get us more information.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.370
How many people are on the discussion page?
- We're not sure.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.770
Is there any connection
in our victims' profiles?

11:28.820 --> 11:33.010
None that we've found. Michael
Edgerton, no previous offences.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.770
Richard Hazelmere was a drug addict,

11:34.820 --> 11:36.890
but nothing else stands
out about his life.

11:36.940 --> 11:41.530
Mark Winstone was murdered at a
neo-Nazi rally three years ago.

11:41.942 --> 11:44.970
Danielle Hallows was a member
of a small-time girl gang.

11:45.020 --> 11:47.500
But nothing big. And the list goes on.

11:47.526 --> 11:50.760
It's a wide spread of
age, race, sex, occupation.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.510
How many murders are we talking?

11:52.690 --> 11:54.237
Ten so far that we've ID'd.

11:54.433 --> 11:57.250
Maybe 11. I know. It's huge.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.370
There are two home addresses on the website
that have no murders associated with them.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.925
And we have a star at an
unidentified stretch of canal,

12:04.951 --> 12:07.050
that we're treating as a
potential crime scene.

12:07.363 --> 12:10.161
That could mean there's an
undiscovered body in that water.

12:11.215 --> 12:13.161
That'd only explain one of the addresses.

12:13.187 --> 12:16.187
Which means that the other address
could be a potential victim.

12:16.632 --> 12:19.719
Someone still alive,
who is being targeted.

12:20.521 --> 12:22.521
Someone that we can save.

12:23.936 --> 12:26.806
Do you know what I hate about up here?
- Serial killers?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.491
No. If you're not wearing

12:28.517 --> 12:32.410
a 200-quid, shit blue suit, you're not dressed right.
- Mm.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.170
No, not yours. Yours is nice.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.130
Oh, and it only cost 180.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.890
I was looking at a lovely
beige one for the wedding.

12:38.940 --> 12:41.610
I don't fancy a wedding dress.
Can't dance at the disco.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.542
Me and Chris are thinking of getting
matching bride and groom suits.

12:44.808 --> 12:47.010
You still with him?
- No! We broke up in June.

12:47.206 --> 12:48.810
I thought so. You texted me.

12:48.860 --> 12:50.930
Oh, you got it, did you?
You didn't text back.

12:51.644 --> 12:53.644
Didn't I?
- No.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.650
Shit! Sorry. Are you all right?

12:56.848 --> 12:58.933
Yeah. Now.

13:00.260 --> 13:01.970
We had a lovely time. It was nice

13:02.020 --> 13:06.210
and then we'd done that,
and I got fed up of nice.

13:06.377 --> 13:10.297
Nice isn't knicker-ripping, is it?
- No, it's not.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.630
Oh, I've really missed you.

13:14.203 --> 13:15.310
Awww.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.598
She really has!

13:18.570 --> 13:19.570
Oh!

13:20.960 --> 13:22.445
A Gold meeting sounds exciting!

13:22.471 --> 13:26.670
Yeah. People being slaughtered in the
streets. Better than Blackpool.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.600
No, I just meant, it must be exciting for
someone of your rank to be invited to one.

13:31.512 --> 13:33.432
What you gonna wear?

13:38.744 --> 13:40.784
I'll get back to work.

13:45.339 --> 13:48.574
She's OK. You'll get to like her.
Well, you'll hate her for a bit,

13:48.600 --> 13:51.680
because I've said you'll like her.
Then you'll get to like her.

13:52.729 --> 13:54.869
I can't go dressed like this.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.020
Can I interest you in a shit blue suit?

14:24.320 --> 14:26.310
'It's come down from the top corridor.'

14:26.360 --> 14:30.153
As this is a potential critical incident for
Manchester Met, all days off are cancelled.

14:30.179 --> 14:33.029
We should expect to be working
overtime for the foreseeable future.

14:33.055 --> 14:35.280
I've got an important weekend comiing up.
I'll struggle to...

14:35.306 --> 14:36.214
You'll be here.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.444
It's his wife's...
- Unless you're about say funeral, you'll be here.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.416
OK, Lee. See what we can
find out about the stars.

14:42.442 --> 14:44.950
Any significance in the
patterns? Any symbolism?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.081
Have we accounted for
the two home addresses?

14:47.107 --> 14:49.440
Erm... One is a flat in Ardwick.

14:49.466 --> 14:52.699
We've got a Jenna Mawson, 18,
registered as living there.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.089
The DVLA sent her picture
from her provisional licence.

14:55.115 --> 14:57.829
And the other?
- Levenshulme, currently empty.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.485
And ther's no reports of a missing
person at either address.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.606
I want you to try and
trace the witness

15:02.632 --> 15:04.547
who gave you the statement
at the Edgerton murder.

15:04.573 --> 15:06.476
Do a photo-fit. Ask
around the local area.

15:06.502 --> 15:08.010
Could be crucial down the line.

15:08.036 --> 15:10.578
Have we located the structure
canal where the star is placed?

15:10.604 --> 15:11.967
We're sure it's the
Rochdale Canal.

15:11.993 --> 15:13.913
That canal is on its
fair share of deaths.

15:13.939 --> 15:17.976
No bodies recovered so far associated with
either the Levenshulme or Ardwick addresses.

15:18.002 --> 15:20.214
Go to Ardwick, check out Jenna Mawson.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.630
Anna, speak to the owner
of the Levenshulme flat.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.860
There's a good chance one
is dead and in that canal.

15:24.886 --> 15:26.974
Well we need to identify
which one is still alive

15:27.000 --> 15:29.540
and get to them before
the killer does.

15:30.623 --> 15:34.116
The people accessing this website
could be from all over the world,

15:34.142 --> 15:38.652
which means we might be liaising internationally,
working with Europol and Interpol, so

15:38.678 --> 15:42.348
I expect everyone to pull their fingers
out. No northern plod behaviour.

15:43.038 --> 15:45.070
And we all know each
other, so there's no need

15:45.096 --> 15:47.021
to call me ma'am or boss.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.147
I'd prefer it if you call me Rache.
- Or Godzuki.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.674
I swear, and I am being
absolutely serious,

15:53.700 --> 15:56.700
if I hear that Godzuki shit again,
I'll have you on a discipline.

15:57.728 --> 15:59.448
Are we clear?

16:11.942 --> 16:14.882
Love what you've done
with the place. How is it?

16:15.734 --> 16:18.494
It's like walking in a dead woman's heels,

16:19.060 --> 16:20.590
while she's still watching.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.830
We've got something. One of the matching
licence plates belongs to a Steve Dench.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.630
His car was picked up on the ANPR in
the vicinity of the Edgerton house

16:29.680 --> 16:32.870
on 3 occasions in the weeks
prior to Michael's murder.

16:33.391 --> 16:34.821
It's a left-hand drive

16:34.847 --> 16:37.934
and he's a recorded offence
as a juvenile for knife crime.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.830
Let's go pick him up.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.750
Pete, have we got an update?

16:50.800 --> 16:53.404
We've got a star. No sign of Jenna Mawson.

16:54.177 --> 16:56.510
The neighbours are about as
useful as a snorkel on a fish.

16:56.822 --> 17:00.029
Right. Look for a phone number so we
can zap it and find out where she is.

17:01.043 --> 17:04.042
Make sure you get a description out.
- Will do.

17:18.839 --> 17:22.540
I need to take this. It's Mum
and she's using the Bat Phone.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.990
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
murder. You do not have to say...

17:29.040 --> 17:30.990
What are they doing to Daddy?
- It's OK.

17:31.040 --> 17:35.985
<i>Hello?</i> I don't want to panic you,
love, but Taisie's been arrested.

17:37.821 --> 17:39.821
Drugs?

17:40.360 --> 17:44.360
I'm not worried. She was in a car
with boys. They had some Class Bs.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.950
She was with Sam, her boyfriend.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.150
Oh, I want to sew my own mouth
up every time I say that word.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.605
It's fine, she's growing up.

17:52.631 --> 17:56.862
He's five foot squeak with the
sexual threat of a castrated mole.

17:56.888 --> 17:59.070
Taisie said that she didn't
know the other lads.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.389
They were the ones with drugs.
So, I'm staying out of it.

18:02.553 --> 18:04.294
Mum can cope.

18:04.403 --> 18:08.830
If Taisie says that she didn't know
anything about it, I totally believe her.

18:08.856 --> 18:12.016
Yup. You certain? I know what
I was up to when I was 16.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.480
She still sleeps with her Furby.

18:14.506 --> 18:17.614
So unless she's using it
as a drugs mule, yeah, I am.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.710
Hey, have you noticed,

18:19.981 --> 18:21.937
He isn't in any of these pictures?

18:21.963 --> 18:23.590
Maybe it was Steve taking them?

18:23.640 --> 18:25.510
There's not one family shot.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.590
I've still got pictures up of Abe, and
I'd happily unblock a sink using his face.

18:31.930 --> 18:34.910
Two hoodies that might be of
interest. Same colour, same logo.

18:35.265 --> 18:36.374
Great.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.030
We need to get Wendy
to take a look at them.

18:39.394 --> 18:41.614
Mum's at the station picking up Taisie.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.670
She's asking if I want to pop down.

18:43.846 --> 18:45.494
Like it's mother-and-daughter day.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.310
Probably brought her selfie stick.

18:47.690 --> 18:50.600
Makes a nice change having your
family arrested instead of mine.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.166
He!

18:54.840 --> 18:57.380
So what are you gonna do?
- My job.

18:58.914 --> 19:00.470
Taisie's safe.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.920
There's people out there who
need me, like Jenna Mawson.

19:04.048 --> 19:06.398
Yeah. If she's still alive.

19:06.424 --> 19:09.935
Yeah, well, maybe Steve can
shed a bit of light on that.

19:16.219 --> 19:19.419
Before we start, my client
has prepared a statement.

19:20.920 --> 19:25.150
'I have no knowledge or involvement
in the murder of Michael Edgerton.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.870
At the time of his murder, I was at home.

19:27.982 --> 19:30.292
I left at 7:00am to drive to the gym.

19:30.694 --> 19:32.974
I feel that the manner
in which I was arrested,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.950
the level of intrusion and distress
caused to me and my family,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.830
has left me with no alternative

19:37.880 --> 19:40.920
but to refuse to give any
further co-operation.'

19:44.680 --> 19:48.520
Let's start with where you were
on the morning of January 18th.

19:49.359 --> 19:52.759
I'd like to direct you to my
client's written statement.

20:03.858 --> 20:05.701
Come and get your chips.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.349
Night.

20:08.066 --> 20:11.425
We've found the star on the canal.
Dredging starts at first light.

20:11.451 --> 20:15.681
And Michael Edgerton's girlfriend recognised
the logo on the hoodies from Steve's house.

20:15.978 --> 20:17.350
Where's Pete?

20:18.303 --> 20:19.910
Well, where are we at with Jenna Mawson?

20:19.960 --> 20:23.230
We know she's a foster
kid straight out of care.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.310
She was put into that flat six months ago.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.230
The flat search hasn't given us much.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.550
It was practically empty. We're stuck.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.105
We'll know more when we speak to
her case worker in the morning.

20:33.131 --> 20:36.941
Don't wait until morning. Wake her
up. What about Jenna's phone number?

20:37.104 --> 20:39.174
Not yet. Nobody has a number for her.

20:39.428 --> 20:41.418
Basics. It's just...

20:41.804 --> 20:43.284
it's basics.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.750
Do we at least know what network she's on?

20:45.800 --> 20:48.190
Did you check the flat for
a charger? Top-up cards?

20:48.240 --> 20:51.270
Have we looked for her on social
media? What's Pete been doing?

20:51.568 --> 20:55.341
Boss. Chief Superintendent
Dreyfus from Europol.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.750
Chief Dreyfus, Acting DI
Bailey of Syndicate 9.

21:03.800 --> 21:07.550
Good to speak to you, sir.
- <i>'Bonsoir, Madame.'</i>

21:07.600 --> 21:09.840
Bonsoir. How can I help you?

21:10.360 --> 21:12.150
'Listen very carefully.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.400
I shall say this only once...'

21:47.760 --> 21:50.710
Do you mind? That couch
is knackering my back.

21:50.987 --> 21:53.630
I looked like Quasimodo's
nan on my till today.

21:53.933 --> 21:56.203
Don't snore.
- I don't snore.

22:10.780 --> 22:12.450
How's work?

22:12.500 --> 22:15.380
Ah... Can we leave this till morning?

22:16.771 --> 22:18.532
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.210
Everyone's being a bit weird.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.516
Bastards.

22:32.946 --> 22:34.210
Why? What are you doing to' em?

22:34.260 --> 22:35.276
Me?

22:35.674 --> 22:37.744
No, it's them.

22:38.779 --> 22:40.719
They're just all stuck.

22:42.466 --> 22:44.666
Is Janet being funny with you?

22:45.500 --> 22:47.180
I dunno.

22:49.974 --> 22:52.314
Stop staring at me, you dickhead.

23:00.997 --> 23:04.357
If you're looking for your vibrators
they're on top of the wardrobe.

23:05.020 --> 23:07.290
I caught our Callum under the duvet

23:07.316 --> 23:10.256
using the glow-in-the-dark
one as a night light.

23:11.830 --> 23:15.130
Well... at least that's what
I told myself he was doing.

23:21.731 --> 23:25.241
Photo-fit of the witness Anna
spoke to after the Edgerton murder.

23:25.580 --> 23:27.610
I've attended a meeting
about Jenna this morning.

23:27.660 --> 23:30.629
Social Services might have some
idea as to where she might be.

23:30.655 --> 23:33.525
How we doing with Steve's alibi?
- His wife confirmed his story, and

23:33.551 --> 23:36.421
We've got him signing into the
gym on the morning of the murder.

23:36.447 --> 23:39.699
He owns identical hoodies to our suspect.
His car was spoted around there,

23:39.725 --> 23:41.850
and innocent people
don't refuse to speak, so

23:41.876 --> 23:43.626
When you get back from
MAPPA, I want you to try

23:43.652 --> 23:47.242
trace those whose signatures appear
before and after Steve's at the gym.

23:47.340 --> 23:49.330
See if they can narrow
down the time for us.

23:49.380 --> 23:53.312
Partial number plates throw up another
left-hand drive car, owned by Kenny Medford.

23:53.338 --> 23:57.130
One of his previous address was a couple of
streets away from Jenna Mawson's care home.

23:57.156 --> 23:59.321
We'd a few problems tracing him
because he moves around a bit.

23:59.347 --> 24:01.291
We managed to make contact
with his girlfriend.

24:01.317 --> 24:05.707
She was jumpy. Claimed she'd no knowledge of his
whereabouts, they'd been separated for months.

24:05.733 --> 24:08.763
But Uniform spotted Kenny's car
parked a couple of streets away.

24:08.789 --> 24:11.379
Speak to the neighbours. Get
a forensic lift on the car.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.230
Have we had forensics back on Steve's car yet?
- Clean.

24:14.780 --> 24:15.860
Shit.

24:18.071 --> 24:19.563
Can't find Kenny Medford.

24:19.589 --> 24:23.219
We've got Steve Dench, but his
car's spotless, computer's clean,

24:23.240 --> 24:26.270
no murder weapon, no motive.
Oh, and he's not talking.

24:26.520 --> 24:30.470
Got a teenage girl, hopefully still alive,
walking around with a target on her head.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.715
And the forensics are
back on Steve's hoodies?

24:32.741 --> 24:35.411
Never been worn. What d'you reckon?

24:36.089 --> 24:38.680
You've been back at work a
day. You've got a promotion.

24:38.706 --> 24:40.894
You'd a Gold meeting.  You blew up at

24:40.920 --> 24:44.082
the prime suspect in a serial killer
case. Going all right, I'd say.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.974
And if there are two unworn
hoodies in Steve's closet,

24:47.000 --> 24:50.400
who's to say there isn't a discarded
one somewhere covered in blood?

24:55.102 --> 24:57.242
Sorry I wasn't in touch more.

24:58.107 --> 25:00.377
It was just full on down there.

25:01.107 --> 25:04.207
Hadn't noticed. I was too
busy planning my wedding.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.830
Would you give Pete a kick up
the arse about Jenna Mawson?

25:11.880 --> 25:14.252
Rachel, Neil Simpson from Serious
Crime is on his way over.

25:14.278 --> 25:18.068
I can't, I'm on my way to oversee the canal search.
- Well get him to meet you there.

25:18.781 --> 25:20.861
All right.
- Janet...

25:22.384 --> 25:24.784
Taisie's not going to
get off with a caution.

25:24.810 --> 25:27.640
I can't tell you why, but
it's looking serious.

25:27.666 --> 25:30.006
I just wanted you to be prepared.

25:36.814 --> 25:38.644
Janet, have you seen my day book?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.750
Erm... No.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.246
No.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.430
Where are we at with the website?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.670
We're nowhere. We can't
trace the IP addresses.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.141
There's a double encryption
on the discussions page.

25:53.167 --> 25:56.510
I thought we could get past all that stuff now.
- Yeah?  Who told you that?

25:56.536 --> 25:59.990
I don't know. I read it.
- Maybe people can. They don't work for us.

26:00.787 --> 26:03.943
In terms of internet crime, police are like
your granny programming the video player.

26:03.969 --> 26:06.750
But we've done stuff like
that before, haven't we?

26:06.800 --> 26:09.333
Or how have we managed to
break online paedophile rings?

26:09.359 --> 26:11.802
We've got lucky, or we've
caught the stupid ones.

26:11.828 --> 26:14.576
They cracked Silk Road. That
was hidden by Tor, wasn't it?

26:14.602 --> 26:17.216
As fas as I know, Silk Road
was done with legwork.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.663
Looking for mistakes, someone
giving away a first name

26:19.689 --> 26:22.230
cross-referenced with
part of an email address.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.548
Same way you catch people every day, piece
evidence together and hope they get sloppy.

26:25.574 --> 26:28.350
Great. Do that.
- It took years.

26:28.696 --> 26:30.636
Then do something else.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.933
We hope to hack the Taking
Out The Trash site and get

26:34.959 --> 26:36.947
a piece of malware on there
in the next 24 hours.

26:36.973 --> 26:39.243
If we succeed without
anyone spotting us,

26:39.269 --> 26:41.379
we should be able to
trace anyone who uses it.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.870
Although we can't decrypt the
discussion page, the way it's laid out,

26:44.920 --> 26:47.510
we're pretty sure there's
only two users of the site.

26:47.560 --> 26:51.150
The metadata backs that up.
(<i>Found something</i>) - Which means?

26:51.480 --> 26:54.550
Well, for example, one person
posts an image of someone's house

26:54.600 --> 26:57.430
in one size and the crime
scene is a different size.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.150
Is it always one person who
posts the image of the house

27:00.200 --> 27:02.670
and the other the crime scene?
- No. They take turns.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.722
Because they're challenging each other?
- Could be.

27:05.748 --> 27:08.698
One person is posting
a target for the other

27:08.724 --> 27:11.194
and the other one commits the murder?

27:12.762 --> 27:14.702
They're playing a game.

27:25.920 --> 27:29.790
The body is Lukas Balusek, an overseas
student from the Czech Republic.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.790
We spoke to his landlady in Levenshulme.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.030
She thought he'd done a
runner, gone back home.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.790
He missed rent payments before
he went missing last year.

27:36.840 --> 27:41.106
OK. This is footage from around the
date our landlady noticed him missing.

27:41.731 --> 27:44.394
This leads to the stretch of
canal where we found his body.

27:46.301 --> 27:47.790
Just finished with Rae.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.602
She says that from a forensic
psychologist's perspective,

27:50.628 --> 27:52.870
your game theory makes sense to her.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.750
These people are thrill
seekers, evading the authorities,

27:55.800 --> 27:58.670
outsmarting us, makes
the game even more fun.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.790
Historically, they were
forced to act alone

28:00.840 --> 28:04.390
but modern technology means they can
find people with similar interests.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.110
These people don't have
to play alone any more.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.240
We reckon that this is
Balusek meeting his killer.

28:11.841 --> 28:15.790
They seem to know each other.
- Or they are happy to have just met.

28:15.940 --> 28:19.050
This part of the canal is a
well-known cruising ground.

28:19.100 --> 28:22.620
Have we got any footage of our suspect leaving?
- 20 minutes later.

28:23.140 --> 28:24.980
But none of Lukas.

28:26.300 --> 28:30.570
Confirmed. Steve Dench was in Edinburgh with
friends the night Lukas Balusek was murdered.

28:30.820 --> 28:34.010
Jenna's social worker couldn't
help us much. Jenna's a quiet girl,

28:34.060 --> 28:37.513
introverted, no friends to speak
of. No presence on social media.

28:37.539 --> 28:39.465
Still no phone number?
- No.

28:39.491 --> 28:40.690
But she signs on.

28:40.894 --> 28:42.839
But the job centre didn't
have a number for her.

28:42.865 --> 28:45.793
If she signs on, she's got a
bank account that they pay into.

28:45.819 --> 28:50.409
So we check to see if there are any payments
to a phone network for credit top-ups.

28:50.435 --> 28:53.635
And then we contact the
network, and get her number.

28:53.739 --> 28:55.689
Did Steve's gym alibi check out?

28:56.575 --> 29:00.310
A woman at the gym said
she knew Steve to nod to

29:00.360 --> 29:02.630
and remembers seeing him
there at around 8:00am

29:02.680 --> 29:04.564
on the morning Michael
Edgerton was killed.

29:04.590 --> 29:08.218
Which still doesn't help us. Come
on, we can do better than this.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.410
Steve's solicitor is
pushing for a release.

29:10.460 --> 29:14.311
Would it be better if we bail him, while
we get ourselves into a stronger position?

29:14.999 --> 29:17.029
Have we traced our other suspect?

29:17.342 --> 29:18.490
No luck yet.

29:18.540 --> 29:20.770
When did his girlfriend
say she last saw him?

29:20.820 --> 29:23.760
I've left my daybook in
the office. I'll check.

29:24.334 --> 29:27.481
Initial forensics have found traces of
blood in the driver seat of Kenny's car.

29:27.507 --> 29:29.850
It could be nothing more than a nosebleed.

29:29.876 --> 29:33.186
As far as this enquiry's concerned,
he's a bloke with a foreign car.

29:33.260 --> 29:35.090
I want him TI'd and move on.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.930
Look at those faces and tell me
you're happy with where we are?

29:38.980 --> 29:42.490
Look at Jenna Mawson's face and tell
me you're happy knowing she's out there

29:42.540 --> 29:46.300
and we are nowhere near getting to her
before she is the next victim in this game.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.090
I can't do this on my own.

29:49.234 --> 29:51.974
And I can't do the
thinking for all of you.

29:53.345 --> 29:55.385
Go home.

30:05.460 --> 30:08.130
Get your feet off my sofa.
- You've got yours on it.

30:08.180 --> 30:10.810
I paid for it. Shift 'em.
- Get your feet down.

30:11.108 --> 30:12.413
Slag!

30:12.874 --> 30:15.730
Don't let him speak to you like
that. He's learnt that from his dad.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.570
Yes, he bloody has.

30:18.092 --> 30:19.820
But he wasn't saying it to me.

30:21.300 --> 30:25.140
So what's wrong today? The
big kids still picking on you?

30:29.620 --> 30:33.130
I'm thinking of putting my flat on the market.
- And do what?

30:33.180 --> 30:36.050
Move back to London.
- Er... No, you're not.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.770
What would I do without
you? Don't be so selfish!

30:38.820 --> 30:41.900
I am selfish. I'm dead selfish.
And I love it that way.

30:43.391 --> 30:44.831
Rache...

30:45.088 --> 30:48.688
You're just bumping into bits at the
moment, because you're not used to them.

30:49.540 --> 30:52.130
You've got to let things get
comfy for once in your life.

30:52.343 --> 30:55.370
I know the thought of
settling down terrifies you.

30:55.420 --> 30:56.881
Why would I wanna settle?

30:57.350 --> 31:00.420
The Baileys aren't particularly
famous for great relationships.

31:01.380 --> 31:03.690
Hey, our Dom's going steady.

31:04.676 --> 31:05.684
What?

31:06.260 --> 31:08.090
Probably helps that they share a cell.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.300
But, just saying.

31:11.140 --> 31:14.240
If he can find happiness,
there's hope for us all.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.700
Right, I'm gonna give that
little shit a talking to.

31:35.140 --> 31:37.680
Is there anything you haven't told me?

31:55.140 --> 31:57.930
No significant DNA was found
on Michael Edgerton's body

31:57.980 --> 32:01.367
and the partial DNA found on Balusek
wasn't a match with Steve Dench.

32:01.393 --> 32:03.450
So we're releasing Steve on bail.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.770
Can I... Can I ask you a favour?

32:05.820 --> 32:07.652
Yeah. Sure.

32:07.678 --> 32:11.113
Oh, I... I want you to
try Kenny's girlfriend.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.610
God knows why he's playing hide-and-seek.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.527
Probably hasn't paid his TV licence.

32:15.553 --> 32:19.850
Just reassure her. Tell her
we're trying to eliminate him.

32:19.876 --> 32:25.216
Or we'll have to start doing a full number on him and
we haven't got the time or the resources for that.

32:25.263 --> 32:29.370
And take Anna. I could do without
her needy little eyes all over me.

32:29.689 --> 32:34.482
I couldn't even get into my own bastard
bathroom this morning. I hate kids.

32:37.616 --> 32:39.686
Sorry, what was the favour?

32:40.300 --> 32:42.370
I hate myself for asking. You can say no.

32:42.420 --> 32:45.957
You should say no. I'd say
no. But, erm... I have to ask.

32:46.820 --> 32:50.010
Dodson's told me that they're
taking Taisie's case further.

32:50.060 --> 32:52.321
And I need to know more.

32:53.236 --> 32:54.576
Morning.

33:15.808 --> 33:18.968
We've got Jenna's number. We've
zapped it. She's at Victoria.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.500
Rachel Bailey, DCI. Hi.

33:49.900 --> 33:51.730
I irritate her, don't I?

33:52.202 --> 33:55.055
I shouldn't worry. You're at
the bottom of a very long list.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.290
Go play upstairs Roxy.

34:13.710 --> 34:16.103
We're trying to eliminate
Kenny from our enquiries

34:16.129 --> 34:18.170
in relation to a series of violent crimes.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.690
So we'd really appreciate your help.

34:35.420 --> 34:37.690
When was the last time you saw Kenny?

34:38.012 --> 34:39.873
Must've been two, three weeks ago.

34:40.158 --> 34:43.358
Which? There's quite a difference
between two and three weeks.

34:43.824 --> 34:45.094
Three.

34:46.380 --> 34:49.330
And which day of the week?
- Thursday.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.370
Just before Anna writes that down.

34:51.420 --> 34:54.730
Are you certain? You weren't too
sure of how many weeks it's been,

34:54.780 --> 34:58.488
but you're rock solid on the day
of the week? Certain it's Thursday?

34:58.753 --> 35:00.269
Yes, I'm sure.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.820
He hasn't made any contact since?

35:04.610 --> 35:05.850
No.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.800
Jenna?

35:12.094 --> 35:13.774
Jenna Mawson?

35:26.893 --> 35:28.163
Jenna?

35:35.449 --> 35:36.729
Jenna!

35:39.100 --> 35:41.410
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Calm down. Calm down.

35:41.460 --> 35:42.731
We're just trying to help.

35:42.757 --> 35:44.750
Get off me, please!
- Calm down.

35:44.898 --> 35:46.370
We're just trying to help.

35:46.420 --> 35:49.520
We've got reason to believe
that you're in danger.

35:53.496 --> 35:55.610
Whose are the trainers in the hall?

35:56.333 --> 35:58.203
They're her grandad's.

35:59.504 --> 36:01.374
I'm going to play out.

36:01.400 --> 36:04.270
Just getting my coat.
- No. Come away, love.

36:06.075 --> 36:07.705
Oh, stop!

36:08.560 --> 36:12.200
Stop. I am arresting you for.
...what am I arresting him for?

36:12.611 --> 36:16.734
I am arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Michael Edgerton.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.625
You ready?
- Hm-hm.

36:32.762 --> 36:35.638
Indecent images of Taisie's boyfriend...
- Sam?

36:35.664 --> 36:39.083
have been found on her phone. A few
have made their way on to social media.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.255
What sort of images?

36:40.281 --> 36:41.630
No. Don't.

36:45.721 --> 36:47.641
OK. OK. Tell me.

36:50.020 --> 36:55.340
Explicit pictures... of him
naked and of his genitals...

36:56.263 --> 36:58.403
of him aroused.
- Stop.

36:58.845 --> 37:00.605
That's awful.

37:01.357 --> 37:04.382
So what? I-I mean... I don't mean...

37:04.408 --> 37:06.893
I don't mean 'so what?'

37:06.919 --> 37:10.205
But... they're only photos.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.242
They're going out together.
That's what kids do. Don't they?

37:13.268 --> 37:16.934
He's only 15.
- She's only 16. They're in the same year at school.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.759
Because Taisie is 16, the police
have to be seen to be complying

37:19.785 --> 37:23.730
to government guidelines, so the case
has been forwarded to Safeguarding.

37:23.756 --> 37:27.506
Once they've looked at it, then
it could... it won't. But it could

37:27.532 --> 37:30.642
be sent to the Serious Sexual Offences unit.
- This is mad.

37:30.668 --> 37:33.948
Possession and distribution of
indecent images of a child under 18.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.912
Common sense will kick in.

37:37.938 --> 37:41.438
Safeguarding will take one
look at this and throw it out.

37:43.874 --> 37:49.300
I hate to say this, but you can't repeat any
of this to Safeguarding, your mum or to Taisie.

37:51.949 --> 37:53.549
I...

38:00.232 --> 38:02.502
Rache, Dodson wants to see you.

38:07.340 --> 38:09.250
We've got a leak.

38:09.300 --> 38:12.860
A blog has posted details of the
murder website and our investigation.

38:13.954 --> 38:16.610
It means we can no longer
choose to withhold information.

38:17.024 --> 38:19.840
Everything that we know is
now in the public domain...

38:20.284 --> 38:23.170
including the password to the
Taking Out The Trash website,

38:23.196 --> 38:26.066
which has now been
accessed over 1,000 times.

38:27.180 --> 38:31.820
People have started posting their own stars,
their mates' pictures, home addresses.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.599
Any hopes of monitoring that site

38:34.997 --> 38:37.620
for future leads and
potential victims, have gone.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.410
The blog also posts
details of our suspects,

38:42.460 --> 38:45.524
Kenny Medford and Steve Dench,
just short of naming 'em.

38:46.164 --> 38:48.250
So, what are we talking?

38:49.186 --> 38:50.610
Bad practice? Human error?

38:50.660 --> 38:53.357
Corruption? I don't know.

38:54.660 --> 38:57.660
You can be certain that it won't
just be me asking those questions.

39:01.857 --> 39:05.030
Did you find your day book?
- Not yet. But I will.

39:05.115 --> 39:08.157
Unless someone's found it
already. Find it or fess up

39:08.183 --> 39:11.281
before Professional Standards
blame this leak on any one of us.

39:11.307 --> 39:15.834
Kenny's solicitor's just quit. Apparently,
it's not appropriate for her to represent him.

39:16.429 --> 39:17.810
Do you think he's confessed,

39:17.860 --> 39:20.660
but told her he's going
to plead not guilty?

39:25.480 --> 39:28.980
Kenny, I'm sure you'd be more
comfortable if you sat down.

39:30.816 --> 39:34.080
Can you say what's stopping
you from sitting down?

39:35.260 --> 39:37.860
I will not answer any of your questions.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.730
My name is Kenny Medford.

39:42.256 --> 39:44.856
I will not answer any of your questions.

39:47.900 --> 39:49.890
How is any of this a game?

39:50.312 --> 39:51.970
We've seen some mad shit.

39:52.020 --> 39:54.338
But the thought that this is
someone's idea of a jolly...

39:54.364 --> 39:56.624
I will not answer any of your questions.

39:56.650 --> 39:59.850
Last night I dreamt of these
hands all over my face.

40:00.700 --> 40:03.970
Give me loo-la's with a
basement full of bodies any day.

40:04.020 --> 40:06.960
You knew where you were with them.
- You did.

40:07.282 --> 40:09.312
It used to be them and us.

40:09.620 --> 40:12.730
Why is that, Kenny?
- It feels like they're everywhere.

40:12.780 --> 40:14.730
My name is Kenny...

40:14.780 --> 40:19.460
I sometimes think we should get all our phones and
computers and smash 'em up for all the good they do.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.420
I won't answer any of your questions.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.640
What have you told Jenna?

40:33.400 --> 40:36.270
As much as I had to and
as little as possible.

40:36.492 --> 40:38.870
Does she know why she might be targeted?

40:38.920 --> 40:43.030
She has no idea. She goes to
the train station every day.

40:43.201 --> 40:45.270
I just like disappearing into the crowds.

40:45.709 --> 40:48.400
The people and the noise,
they stop me thinking.

40:50.380 --> 40:52.060
I like it.

40:52.671 --> 40:55.490
Spends most of her time
trying to be invisible.

40:56.594 --> 40:58.365
She's a ghost.

40:58.888 --> 41:00.800
Makes her the perfect target.

41:01.006 --> 41:02.006
Yeah.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.240
What can we do for her?

41:05.180 --> 41:08.890
I don't know. I can't just kick her
out and say keep your eyes peeled.

41:09.354 --> 41:11.554
Can't we offer her protection?

41:11.580 --> 41:14.450
If we can, that won't be my
call and it won't be tonight.

41:14.985 --> 41:17.130
The best I could offer her
was a bed in the cells.

41:17.180 --> 41:19.580
There's no money for anything else.

41:22.860 --> 41:25.530
I need to go home and give
Taisie a good bollocking

41:25.580 --> 41:28.841
and then... give her the biggest cuddle.

41:30.348 --> 41:33.374
Imagine if all this madness had
happened when you weren't here.

41:33.844 --> 41:35.554
I would've been on the first train.

41:35.727 --> 41:36.844
Yeah.

41:38.275 --> 41:39.920
If you'd read the text.

41:49.117 --> 41:53.202
They've agreed to place an officer at
Jenna Mawson's flat for the next two weeks.

41:54.961 --> 41:56.954
Is erm...

41:57.264 --> 41:58.850
Is Janet busy this morning?

41:59.030 --> 42:00.730
No. Well, yeah.

42:00.780 --> 42:03.090
She's got a second interview
with Kenny Medford.

42:03.140 --> 42:06.646
But I can get someone else on it if you need her?
- How's her daughter?

42:07.210 --> 42:09.290
Yeah. Fine, I think.

42:09.380 --> 42:13.180
If you can spare her, you might
want to send Janet home early.

42:23.336 --> 42:25.176
Go home.
- Mm?

42:27.400 --> 42:30.840
Dodson thinks you should go
home and see Taisie straightaway.

42:39.486 --> 42:41.286
Hello.

42:41.468 --> 42:43.608
I think our Holly's pregnant.

42:46.190 --> 42:49.070
I found a test in the bathroom bin.
It's positive.

42:50.660 --> 42:54.380
It's mine. It's no big deal.
- 'Why didn't you tell me?'

42:55.893 --> 42:57.853
I've been here before.

42:58.154 --> 43:00.704
I wanna see if this one sticks
before I make any decisions.

43:00.920 --> 43:02.790
Oh, Rache, I'm so happy for you.

43:02.840 --> 43:06.640
It's fantastic...
- Look, I've gotta go. I'll see you tonight.

43:12.691 --> 43:15.371
I'm DI Hollister. This is DC Cotlow.

43:16.293 --> 43:19.853
We're from the Serious Sexual
Offences Unit. Can we come in?

43:24.720 --> 43:26.868
Taisie Scott. We are
arresting you...

43:26.894 --> 43:27.950
What?
- For the possession

43:28.000 --> 43:30.390
and distribution of...
- Mum. Mum, do something.

43:30.440 --> 43:33.350
You don't have to say anything...
- It's OK, love. This is madness.

43:33.400 --> 43:36.470
I haven't done anything!
Tell them to stop.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.630
This is crazy. Look at her.

43:38.680 --> 43:41.720
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence...

44:22.300 --> 44:25.800
We've just found the body of
a teenager in Victoria Park.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.772
Will Hudson. He's
registered disabled.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.510
He was nominated on the website.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.350
But with so many hoax
postings, we missed it.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.470
Then his death's our fault.

44:59.080 --> 45:03.910
We are doing everything within our powers to bring
these craven, spineless murderers to justice.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.710
Any other mother would be
round at Sam's mum's house.

45:06.760 --> 45:09.695
You don't get act like any
other mum because I'm a cop.

45:09.721 --> 45:12.959
If there's any chance that this leak isn't
down to you, then you'd better grab it!

45:12.985 --> 45:14.873
You're nobody's favourite
person right now.

45:14.899 --> 45:18.200
The rules are going out the window.
He's started picking his own victims.
