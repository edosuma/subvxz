Previously on The
Girlfriend Experience...

00:20.024 --> 00:21.790
You do this kind of stuff all the time?

00:23.957 --> 00:26.490
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

00:26.557 --> 00:27.957
It turns you on, getting paid.

00:28.024 --> 00:29.590
Who sent you that?

00:29.957 --> 00:30.957
Who sent it?

00:31.024 --> 00:31.957
Say it!

00:32.024 --> 00:32.957
It turns me on!

00:33.024 --> 00:34.090
You sent it.

00:34.857 --> 00:35.957
I didn't send that.

00:36.024 --> 00:37.124
Look!

00:37.957 --> 00:40.123
That's your fucking email!

00:40.190 --> 00:42.923
It didn't just go to me,
too. It went to everybody.

00:42.990 --> 00:45.423
It's all over for you.

00:45.490 --> 00:47.156
It turns you on getting paid.

00:47.224 --> 00:50.024
What... what's the matter?

00:50.090 --> 00:51.756
Someone needs to call 911.

00:52.857 --> 00:54.790
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:54.857 --> 00:57.390
Okay, okay.

01:05.990 --> 01:07.856
Try to breathe normally.

01:07.924 --> 01:10.224
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.123
Just breathe normally.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.223
That's good.

01:22.090 --> 01:23.623
Okay, show's over!

01:23.690 --> 01:25.156
Everybody back to work!

01:26.090 --> 01:27.490
I'm David Tellis.

01:27.557 --> 01:28.723
Managing Partner.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.023
Is Christine gonna be okay?

01:31.090 --> 01:33.623
Do you need to take her
to a more private room?

01:33.690 --> 01:34.790
Just tell me what you need.

01:34.857 --> 01:36.123
She'll be fine.

01:36.190 --> 01:37.590
Is there someone who can take her home?

01:37.657 --> 01:38.723
Yeah.

01:38.790 --> 01:39.856
Kayla...

01:39.924 --> 01:41.190
Can you call a cab and go with her?

01:41.257 --> 01:42.223
Yeah.

01:43.290 --> 01:45.890
Can you call now, please? Thank you.

01:46.724 --> 01:48.390
Everyone, back to work!

01:52.924 --> 01:54.857
Kayla'll take care of you, okay?

02:23.711 --> 02:26.923
Make sure you stay with her
until she gets into her home.

02:26.990 --> 02:28.923
Yeah. Thanks. Thank you.

02:28.990 --> 02:30.890
Go slow. Watch your step.

02:36.057 --> 02:38.623
Do you wanna stop and get something
before you get home?

02:38.690 --> 02:39.990
Is there anything you need?

02:40.057 --> 02:41.557
I'm fine.

02:41.624 --> 02:45.557
Are you hungry? Do you
want a hamburger or something?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.924
Maybe. That actually sounds kinda good.

02:48.224 --> 02:50.090
It does?

02:50.157 --> 02:52.290
Uh, can we stop at Max's on Adams?

03:11.456 --> 03:13.456
You have a nice apartment.

03:18.508 --> 03:21.441
Are you okay? Do you want me to stay?

03:21.508 --> 03:22.708
I'm good.

03:22.775 --> 03:24.241
Thanks.

03:26.375 --> 03:27.741
I'll see you.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.374
See you.

06:02.093 --> 06:03.226
I don't know how you feel about this,

06:03.293 --> 06:04.926
but I'd prefer to meet at my apartment,

06:04.993 --> 06:06.559
instead of at a hotel.

06:08.226 --> 06:12.092
I'd just be more
comfortable, if that's okay with you.

06:12.159 --> 06:14.559
I've been with other women who, um,

06:16.059 --> 06:19.159
I can give you their numbers if
you want to speak with them?

06:19.226 --> 06:21.626
No, you sound wonderful.

06:21.693 --> 06:24.493
That's very considerate of you though.

06:45.693 --> 06:48.126
O'Hare. American Airlines.

06:57.559 --> 06:59.092
Hey, Abby.

06:59.159 --> 07:02.192
We're worried sick. Why
haven't you returned my calls?

07:02.326 --> 07:04.059
I can't talk right now.

07:04.126 --> 07:06.426
What the fuck is going
on? You're scaring me.

07:06.493 --> 07:07.593
I'm fine.

07:07.659 --> 07:10.859
Mom is really upset. We all are.

07:10.926 --> 07:12.426
I can imagine.

07:12.493 --> 07:13.426
But I can't talk about it right now.

07:13.493 --> 07:14.659
I have to go into work.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.259
Wha... what was that
video? Why did you send it?

07:17.326 --> 07:18.792
I have to go.

07:26.359 --> 07:29.892
- Thank you.
- Passport please.

07:29.959 --> 07:31.492
What is the purpose of your visit?

07:31.559 --> 07:33.159
Visiting friends.

07:33.226 --> 07:34.526
Where are you staying?

07:34.593 --> 07:37.159
At the Essex on Richmond.

07:37.226 --> 07:39.792
- How long you staying?
- Three days.

07:43.326 --> 07:46.426
Hi, I have a room under Christine Reade.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.092
I have you down for three nights.

07:50.159 --> 07:51.359
Is the room quiet?

07:51.426 --> 07:53.192
- Yes, it's away from the elevators.
- Great.

07:53.259 --> 07:55.859
I'll need to see ID and a credit card.

08:00.726 --> 08:02.859
- How many keys?
- Just one.

08:19.359 --> 08:22.425
Just a second!

08:30.026 --> 08:32.991
- Hi, how long is this gonna take?
- It's an overnight service.

08:33.058 --> 08:34.379
You'll have them tomorrow by 8am.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.126
Great. Here.

08:36.193 --> 08:37.759
Thank you.

09:05.659 --> 09:07.459
I'm here to see Dennis Masterson.

09:07.526 --> 09:09.326
- And your name?
- Amanda Hayes.

09:09.392 --> 09:11.225
One moment.

09:16.126 --> 09:19.726
Mr. Masterson? Amanda Hayes
is here to see you.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.592
Certainly.

09:21.659 --> 09:23.392
- Penthouse Three.
- Thanks.

09:40.726 --> 09:42.192
Can I get you something to drink?

09:42.259 --> 09:43.725
No, thanks.

09:46.259 --> 09:47.759
This is for you.

09:47.826 --> 09:49.259
Wow.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.592
How was your flight?

09:58.659 --> 10:00.359
It was good.

10:00.426 --> 10:01.459
Thanks.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.392
It's just something small.

10:04.459 --> 10:07.459
It's from a little boutique. She
hand-makes all her jewelry.

10:07.526 --> 10:08.892
It's a bracelet.

10:09.659 --> 10:11.359
I hope you like it.

10:11.792 --> 10:12.958
It's beautiful.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.059
Would you...?

10:19.126 --> 10:20.926
- Help me?
- Sure.

10:26.926 --> 10:27.892
I love it.

10:28.459 --> 10:29.725
Really?

10:29.792 --> 10:31.458
They have others. If
you're in town for a few days,

10:31.526 --> 10:33.326
we can go together and
pick out another one.

10:33.392 --> 10:34.592
I like this one.

10:36.292 --> 10:38.092
Would you like to look around?

10:38.159 --> 10:40.592
Yes, um, I'm just
gonna call my driver and

10:40.659 --> 10:43.259
tell him it'll be a while, I
wasn't sure if you'd changed your mind.

10:43.326 --> 10:44.726
Sure.

11:02.826 --> 11:04.926
Hey, it's me.

11:04.992 --> 11:06.858
Yeah I'm gone I'm gonna be a while.

11:07.592 --> 11:08.825
Okay, great.

11:09.292 --> 11:10.525
Thanks.

11:12.192 --> 11:13.458
The view's amazing.

11:17.026 --> 11:18.459
You wanna see something fun?

11:18.526 --> 11:19.759
Sure.

11:26.359 --> 11:27.659
Wow!

11:33.592 --> 11:35.225
You can also adjust the temperature,

11:35.292 --> 11:37.525
lighting and the sound system.

11:39.726 --> 11:42.026
- Do you want to try?
- Sure.

11:42.992 --> 11:44.458
Here.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.625
Also controls the TV.

12:02.525 --> 12:03.991
That's amazing.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.391
Should we sit down?

12:12.791 --> 12:14.557
That feels good.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.758
I think it's best if you leave.

13:16.925 --> 13:18.458
Whatever you want.

13:49.491 --> 13:50.891
I had a really nice time.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.591
I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me.

13:55.725 --> 13:57.658
I can stay if you want to talk about it.

13:57.725 --> 13:59.658
No, you need to leave.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.225
Okay.

14:55.925 --> 14:58.491
- Got Stoli on the rocks?
- You bet.

15:02.524 --> 15:03.457
Start a tab.

15:03.524 --> 15:04.924
- Sure.
- Thanks.

15:12.991 --> 15:14.091
How's the food?

15:14.591 --> 15:15.624
Good.

15:17.424 --> 15:18.924
What are you having?

15:19.791 --> 15:20.924
The roasted chicken salad.

15:21.491 --> 15:22.791
Sounds good.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.890
So what... uh brings you to Toronto?

15:26.957 --> 15:28.357
- Work.
- Oh yeah?

15:28.424 --> 15:29.657
What do you do?

15:29.724 --> 15:31.457
I don't mean to be
rude, but I've had a long day

15:31.524 --> 15:34.290
and I just want to be alone.

15:34.357 --> 15:36.090
I was just making conversation.

15:36.724 --> 15:37.757
Understood.

15:42.924 --> 15:44.357
Hi, this is Amanda.

15:44.424 --> 15:45.724
Hi, Amanda.

15:45.791 --> 15:48.124
I saw your ad on Ceres Amore.

15:49.124 --> 15:51.790
- What's your name?
- Rick.

15:51.857 --> 15:54.890
I'm looking at your photos right now.

15:54.957 --> 15:56.523
I take it you like them?

15:56.591 --> 15:58.224
Yeah.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.291
What color are your eyes?

16:00.424 --> 16:01.824
They're green.

16:01.891 --> 16:04.357
What are you looking for?

16:04.424 --> 16:06.357
What does your face look like?

16:06.424 --> 16:07.952
I've been told I'm beautiful.

16:07.977 --> 16:09.848
I don't think you'll be disappointed.

16:09.891 --> 16:11.557
And when you cum?

16:13.424 --> 16:16.057
What does your pussy taste like, bitch?

16:37.924 --> 16:39.624
This is Amanda.

16:39.691 --> 16:42.724
Yeah, I saw your ad. Are
you still in Toronto?

16:42.791 --> 16:44.224
Yes.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.791
Are you available now?

16:45.857 --> 16:47.323
No, not until 6pm.

16:47.391 --> 16:48.991
How much an hour?

16:49.057 --> 16:51.590
A thousand an hour. Two-hour minimum.

16:51.657 --> 16:53.490
You're okay with other women?

16:53.557 --> 16:54.823
Yes.

16:55.991 --> 16:58.991
I'm staying at the Trump, Room 5501.

16:59.757 --> 17:00.857
What's your name?

17:00.924 --> 17:02.057
Gary.

17:02.124 --> 17:03.490
And your last name?

17:03.557 --> 17:04.490
Barber.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.857
Do you have any references?

17:05.924 --> 17:08.390
Yeah, they'll be here.
You want their numbers?

17:08.457 --> 17:09.890
Yes, please.

17:51.657 --> 17:53.023
- Amanda, right?
- Yeah.

17:53.091 --> 17:54.424
Dana?

17:54.491 --> 17:56.124
Monica. We spoke earlier.

17:56.924 --> 17:58.124
Thanks.

18:00.424 --> 18:01.757
Uh, do you party?

18:02.490 --> 18:03.990
No, I don't.

18:04.057 --> 18:05.490
But I'm fine with it.

18:05.557 --> 18:07.957
They do, just so you know.

18:18.524 --> 18:19.624
You're Amanda?

18:19.690 --> 18:21.456
Yes. Gary?

18:30.824 --> 18:32.124
That's Dana.

18:33.557 --> 18:35.890
Here. Sit down.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.557
Hi. Nice to meet you.

18:59.257 --> 19:00.490
Thanks.

19:05.624 --> 19:07.690
So, Amanda...

19:09.390 --> 19:12.156
Who are you and what's your story?

19:12.224 --> 19:15.324
Wow, that's a tough question, um...

19:15.390 --> 19:17.290
I was born in Philadelphia.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.157
I live in Chicago now.

19:19.224 --> 19:21.057
I'm on my second year of law school...

19:21.124 --> 19:22.824
Want something to drink?

19:23.424 --> 19:24.624
Sure.

19:50.524 --> 19:53.324
You two look like you'd like each other.

19:53.390 --> 19:55.190
You wanna kiss her?

19:59.424 --> 20:01.524
Yeah... She's hot.

20:22.124 --> 20:24.490
- You want a blow job?
- Maybe later.

20:28.757 --> 20:30.157
I wanna see your tits.

20:30.224 --> 20:32.557
Show me your tits right now.

20:53.824 --> 20:55.490
So when did you get here?

20:55.557 --> 20:57.557
About an hour or so ago.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.157
Around five.

20:59.224 --> 21:00.657
I got here at noon.

21:00.957 --> 21:02.323
I need some water.

21:03.357 --> 21:05.157
- You want anything?
- No thanks.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.589
I'm good.

21:11.990 --> 21:14.423
This is how it was the last time, too.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.223
How long have you known Gary?

21:17.290 --> 21:19.923
This is only my second time seeing him.

21:21.357 --> 21:22.857
So from you're Chicago?

21:22.923 --> 21:24.123
Yeah.

21:25.223 --> 21:27.023
And how long are you in town for?

21:27.090 --> 21:28.423
Just a few days.

21:29.223 --> 21:30.656
Do you work here often?

21:30.723 --> 21:31.923
No, it's my first time.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.090
It's... fun.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.289
It's almost nine.

21:40.357 --> 21:42.157
How long are you booked for?

21:42.223 --> 21:44.356
Three hours.

21:44.423 --> 21:46.289
I'm gonna go tell him I'm leaving.

22:11.257 --> 22:12.990
We're leaving.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.490
I don't want you to go.

22:18.023 --> 22:19.956
I want you both to stay.

22:23.757 --> 22:25.290
Are you staying?

22:25.357 --> 22:27.323
Yeah, overnight.

22:27.390 --> 22:30.223
How much am I paying
you? A thousand an hour?

22:30.290 --> 22:31.456
Fifteen hundred.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.190
Here's ten thousand.

22:57.290 --> 22:59.623
Here, count this to make sure.

23:50.990 --> 23:52.423
- Taxi?
- Yes.

23:54.357 --> 23:56.390
- How are you today?
- Good, thanks.

23:57.257 --> 23:58.390
Are you enjoying Toronto?

23:58.457 --> 23:59.957
Very much, thanks.

24:00.790 --> 24:02.456
Have a good day.

24:21.857 --> 24:24.257
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:25.357 --> 24:26.290
- Nice dress.
- Thanks.

24:26.357 --> 24:27.957
- Who is it?
- Halston.

24:28.857 --> 24:30.757
Something to drink?

24:30.823 --> 24:32.656
Ummm, I'm gonna wait.

24:32.723 --> 24:34.523
Did you get some sleep?

24:34.590 --> 24:36.223
- A few hours.
- Mmm.

24:36.290 --> 24:38.090
Wonder how Dana held up?

24:38.157 --> 24:39.990
She might still be there.

24:41.223 --> 24:43.656
Maybe I would be
too, if I liked to party.

24:43.723 --> 24:46.156
Are you solely cash-based?

24:46.223 --> 24:47.589
No, I set up a company

24:47.657 --> 24:49.423
and can take credit cards, but

24:49.490 --> 24:52.056
my clients rarely want to use them.

24:53.323 --> 24:54.723
So you're new at this?

24:54.790 --> 24:56.556
Eight to nine months.

24:56.623 --> 24:58.889
I'm looking to expand my client base.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.723
I'm trying to get rid of mine.

25:01.857 --> 25:04.457
I've been doing this for six years.

25:04.523 --> 25:07.656
It's just so easy. It's
like going to an ATM.

25:08.657 --> 25:11.457
But, what do you want to do?

25:11.523 --> 25:13.689
I don't know. Have kids.

25:15.190 --> 25:17.690
Oh, there they are.

25:19.757 --> 25:22.490
- Hey, Colin.
- Nice to see you.

25:22.557 --> 25:24.490
- You must be Amanda.
- Hi.

25:24.557 --> 25:27.723
I'm so sorry. Um, would you
just excuse me for a second?

25:27.790 --> 25:29.656
Sure. No problem.

25:32.371 --> 25:34.290
Hey Martin, I'm just in
the middle of something.

25:34.357 --> 25:35.457
Could I call you back?

25:35.523 --> 25:37.289
I need to speak to you now, if possible.

25:37.357 --> 25:38.657
Okay, hold on.

25:45.423 --> 25:46.489
Yes?

25:46.557 --> 25:47.523
I've been trying to get a hold of you.

25:47.590 --> 25:48.823
Are you okay?

25:48.890 --> 25:50.323
You got the email?

25:50.390 --> 25:52.723
Yes. Can you come in and meet?

25:52.790 --> 25:54.423
I'm out of town.

25:54.490 --> 25:56.290
Somebody sent the
tape to Chicago Lister.

25:56.357 --> 25:57.823
They just ran a story.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.323
Where are you?

25:59.390 --> 26:01.356
I'm just out of town. I
needed to get away for a while.

26:01.490 --> 26:03.024
We need to deal with this. When's

26:03.049 --> 26:04.447
the soonest you can get here?

26:04.490 --> 26:05.590
I don't know, I'll
have to check flights.

26:05.657 --> 26:07.223
Tomorrow morning?

26:07.290 --> 26:08.690
How bad is it?

26:08.757 --> 26:10.523
Why don't we talk about
it when you're here?

26:10.590 --> 26:13.123
Come by my office as soon as you get in.

26:27.090 --> 26:29.056
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

26:29.123 --> 26:31.589
- Yes.
- It turns you on, getting paid.

26:34.457 --> 26:35.523
Say it!

26:35.590 --> 26:37.223
It turns me on!

26:49.357 --> 26:50.790
Have you been to Aria yet?

26:50.857 --> 26:52.423
That's the one in the
Four Seasons, right?

26:52.490 --> 26:53.770
Yeah, it's actually really good.

26:53.790 --> 26:55.590
- I ordered you a white wine.
- Great.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.757
I was starting to worry you
were gonna bail on me.

26:58.423 --> 26:59.789
I'm sorry.

27:00.555 --> 27:02.688
You have my full attention.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.288
- You smell good.
- Thanks.

27:07.689 --> 27:09.489
You from Toronto?

27:09.555 --> 27:10.788
No...

27:11.622 --> 27:13.155
Originally uh,

27:13.222 --> 27:14.855
from the Midwest.
