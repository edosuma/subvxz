Thank you, sir.

01:11.416 --> 01:12.748
Sir!

01:13.456 --> 01:17.248
- You paid two zents less.
- Don't have change.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.124
Two zents!

01:20.456 --> 01:23.080
You dirty Korean!

01:23.416 --> 01:26.748
Two zents? Say it right,
two cents, moron!

01:29.292 --> 01:31.164
You owe me money!

01:31.500 --> 01:34.040
Get off me, you scum.

01:34.372 --> 01:37.372
This is Japan.
Go home if you don't like it.

01:37.708 --> 01:39.054
Go back to your damn country!

01:39.208 --> 01:40.663
Give me my money!

01:40.664 --> 01:41.664
Go back.

01:41.832 --> 01:43.580
Give me my fucking money.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.708
Be grateful that you can
make money in Japan.

01:56.832 --> 01:58.292
Fuck you!

<i>I'm only a damn dog.</i>

02:05.832 --> 02:08.708

I'm only a damn dog.</i>

02:29.208 --> 02:30.208
Hey.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.956
Who wrote this poem?

02:35.416 --> 02:36.872
<i>Damn Dog.</i>

02:43.664 --> 02:45.164
What are you doing?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.916
It says "I'm a damn dog".

02:49.080 --> 02:50.623
The Damn Dog must be the poet

02:50.624 --> 02:52.332
I'm serious.

02:53.416 --> 02:54.832
Park Yeol.

02:55.789 --> 02:58.687
He's the craziest Korean rebel in Japan.

02:59.414 --> 03:02.124
Parku... Yeoru?

03:02.164 --> 03:04.040
What? You just called him a fool.

03:04.164 --> 03:06.539
I didn't say that.

03:06.540 --> 03:09.292
Say it right. Park Yeol.

03:09.903 --> 03:11.027
Parku Yeoru.

03:11.764 --> 03:13.808
Getting close. Say it again.

03:13.932 --> 03:14.600
Parku Yeoru.

03:14.601 --> 03:17.224
- Almost there, one more time.
- Parku Yeoru!

03:18.180 --> 03:19.639
I got it right.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.724
Forget it. You never got closer.

03:22.724 --> 03:25.972
There comes the damn dog. Hey, Yeol!

03:30.472 --> 03:36.391
You are the craziest Korean rebel,

03:36.392 --> 03:40.600
Parku... Yol?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.263
Is she Japanese or Korean?

03:44.264 --> 03:46.100
Somewhere between.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.807
I'm Kaneko Fumiko.

03:48.808 --> 03:51.516
My Korean name is Mun-ja.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.680
Mun-ja?

03:53.392 --> 03:54.867
<i>Monthly Magazine
"Young Korean"</i>

03:54.892 --> 03:57.016
Oh, Damn Dog!

03:57.724 --> 03:59.516
How did you know?

04:00.224 --> 04:05.724
You're the 8th woman who
came to me after reading it.

04:06.892 --> 04:07.892
Wait!

04:09.100 --> 04:13.680
Do you have a spouse?

04:16.055 --> 04:17.724
I mean...

04:19.764 --> 04:22.971
If you have one,

04:22.972 --> 04:29.056
I don't mind just being your comrade.

04:30.140 --> 04:31.472
What do you think?

04:37.607 --> 04:41.939
Well, I'm single.

04:46.056 --> 04:47.808
Let's live together.

04:49.808 --> 04:51.556
I'm an anarchist, too.

04:53.848 --> 04:54.848
Let's go.

04:55.516 --> 04:56.516
Okay.

04:59.308 --> 05:02.724
How old are you?

05:04.224 --> 05:05.472
Twenty.

05:08.932 --> 05:12.100
Let me sit on it once in a while.

05:14.264 --> 05:16.640
Who is she?

05:17.348 --> 05:21.348
Why? Any hard feelings against Japanese?

05:22.140 --> 05:24.847
I'm against Japanese authorities,

05:24.848 --> 05:27.516
not the Japanese people.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.056
Fumiko.

06:07.972 --> 06:11.875
Nitric acid 75%, charcoal
15% and sulfur 10%.

06:14.132 --> 06:16.007
We followed the formula. What's wrong?

06:16.008 --> 06:20.300
Look at the color.
You put too much charcoal.

06:21.672 --> 06:25.424
Then, is charcoal 70% and sulfur 15%?

06:26.424 --> 06:30.216
This stupid bomb makes me explode.

06:30.508 --> 06:32.380
Any news from Shanghai?

06:33.380 --> 06:35.340
It will come soon.

06:35.924 --> 06:40.924
How can we get nitroglycerin?

06:55.092 --> 06:58.008
We know you stole the
campaign money from Russia.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.017
Who are you?

06:59.042 --> 07:00.042
We are...

07:04.756 --> 07:05.924
I mean we are...

07:08.300 --> 07:10.840
What's our group name again?

07:13.008 --> 07:14.008
Guys?

07:15.500 --> 07:18.371
<i>Patriots</i> until yesterday.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.540
From today, we're <i>Smashers.</i>

07:22.624 --> 07:26.872
You idiots. Do you know who I am?

07:27.164 --> 07:29.871
First chief editor
of Northeast Asia Daily,

07:29.872 --> 07:31.332
Kim Sung-cheol.

07:32.664 --> 07:35.664
Where's the campaign money?

07:36.832 --> 07:39.080
None of your business.

07:39.748 --> 07:43.664
Hey, smart ass. You think we're dumbheads?

07:44.416 --> 07:46.291
You think you're a big shot,

07:46.292 --> 07:50.040
just because you gave a
big independence speech?

07:50.065 --> 07:52.689
Is that why you're
treating us like idiots?

07:53.000 --> 07:58.664
You fools know nothing
about international politics

07:59.040 --> 08:03.039
Russian socialism
and Wilson's nationalism,

08:03.040 --> 08:04.011
After March 1st movement...

08:04.036 --> 08:05.580
Shut your fucking mouth.

08:05.792 --> 08:09.664
We can't even afford a damn bomb.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.623
You were gonna run away
with that money, right?

08:13.624 --> 08:17.080
You ignorant Koreans
have no idea...

08:19.080 --> 08:20.332
You son of a bitch.

08:21.208 --> 08:24.292
You're that smart to walk
away with that money?

08:29.080 --> 08:30.124
Let's do it.

08:35.539 --> 08:36.416
Move! Move!

08:36.539 --> 08:37.539
It's my turn.

08:43.832 --> 08:44.748
Table by the window.

08:44.749 --> 08:46.579
- Okay.
- Thanks.

08:46.580 --> 08:49.164
The food is coming.

08:51.332 --> 08:54.915
Here it is. Fishball soup.

08:54.916 --> 08:59.164
Sugimoto ran away, so that bomb is gone

09:00.872 --> 09:06.580
Kim was arrested, so the
Shanghai plan's screwed.

09:07.248 --> 09:11.708
We made it by ourselves,
but that didn't work

09:12.040 --> 09:13.208
I've got an idea.

09:13.664 --> 09:14.792
What's that?

09:16.332 --> 09:20.831
Each pharmacy sells 0.02
grams of explosives.

09:20.832 --> 09:26.916
Let's hit 100 pharmacies,
then we can make a real bomb.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.664
That's a brilliant idea.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.747
Do you even have money
to go around the city?

09:35.748 --> 09:37.999
Let's rob pro-japanese businessmen.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.832
And use that money on the road?

09:41.708 --> 09:43.791
Use your brain, dumb head.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.580
You just called me dumb? What the fuck!

09:49.248 --> 09:51.663
Hey hey, take it easy. Come down.

09:51.664 --> 09:53.292
Okay, okay.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.623
Fumiko, bring something for these pricks.

09:56.624 --> 09:57.624
Got it.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.248
Any news from Shanghai?

10:02.332 --> 10:04.872
I'll pick up the bomb when they're ready.

10:08.456 --> 10:13.248
Look at those commies, they're
up to something again.

10:13.580 --> 10:17.832
We should wipe out those rubbish Koreans.

10:18.164 --> 10:22.124
Please be quiet, we have customers.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.347
Who the fuck are you?

10:24.372 --> 10:26.055
Are you fucking Korean, too?

10:26.080 --> 10:29.956
Behave like a civilized citizen.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.832
Let go of me.

10:35.124 --> 10:36.332
Stop it.

10:37.055 --> 10:38.183
Give me a knife.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.292
Get off me.

10:43.872 --> 10:46.975
How dare you wield a sword!
You pathetic punks.

10:47.580 --> 10:51.291
Hot, right? Fuck off, you jerks.

10:51.292 --> 10:54.748
Still playing samurai, huh?

10:55.164 --> 10:57.708
You want me to cut off your topknot?

10:58.027 --> 10:59.691
You son of a bitch.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.416
Fuck off, you asshole.

11:05.792 --> 11:06.916
Scared now?

11:08.372 --> 11:11.332
You'll pay for this!

11:11.416 --> 11:12.708
Get 'em!

11:18.908 --> 11:21.864
That was our soup.

11:23.895 --> 11:25.683
This worked better for kicking out

11:25.708 --> 11:27.608
those dumb imperialists.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.332
It's called "Socialist
Fishball Soup" anyway.

11:34.559 --> 11:36.183
Will that be enough?

11:36.208 --> 11:39.579
Hey, why don't we throw Fumiko at them?

11:39.580 --> 11:43.624
Right, Fumiko. You'll be a fantastic bomb.

11:43.956 --> 11:44.624
Me?

11:44.664 --> 11:46.248
Come on, Ms. Bomb.

11:48.872 --> 11:54.956
Here's our secret weapon!
Kaneko Fumiko bomb!

11:58.443 --> 11:59.443
Hasuyo.

11:59.639 --> 12:02.223
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

12:02.248 --> 12:04.017
- Something happened?
- Come here.

12:04.042 --> 12:05.458
Fumiko bomb is useless.

12:07.766 --> 12:09.682
Park, have a good time!

12:10.456 --> 12:13.540
<i>"An Appeal to the Young"</i> - Kropotkin.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.161
Have you read this?

12:15.416 --> 12:18.475
Bourgeoisie go on honeymoons
to celebrate their wedding.

12:18.632 --> 12:21.424
Why don't we publish a book, instead?

12:21.664 --> 12:23.664
Kropotkin...

12:24.573 --> 12:25.821
Wait.

12:28.072 --> 12:30.947
I have <i>"The Conquest of Bread".</i>

12:30.948 --> 12:32.864
Why don't we translate it together?

12:33.156 --> 12:36.116
There's a translation for that already

12:36.492 --> 12:38.779
I don't wanna publish an existing book.

12:38.780 --> 12:42.200
Why don't we try writing our own?

12:53.700 --> 12:55.364
- Park!
- Yeah.

12:57.408 --> 12:59.572
- Come here - Why?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.240
What's that?

13:05.864 --> 13:08.031
<i>- Cohabitation agreement -</i>

13:08.032 --> 13:13.156
Do we really need this?
We can just live together.

13:13.908 --> 13:14.948
Stamp it.

13:16.780 --> 13:17.572
Are you sure?

13:17.572 --> 13:18.572
Yes.

13:24.072 --> 13:25.408
You won't regret?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.072
Never.

13:31.492 --> 13:33.072
Stop it.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.200
That's it.

13:40.364 --> 13:41.616
You stamp it too.

13:55.116 --> 13:57.991
A Japanese anarchist
sent some money to us.

13:57.992 --> 14:02.780
A Japanese anarchist sent some money to us.
<i>- Treason -</i>

14:07.364 --> 14:08.364
Read it.

14:11.556 --> 14:16.224
"I'm just a wanderer in
Korea, asking for bread.

14:16.740 --> 14:21.992
I'm sending small donation
to help your campaign.

14:22.593 --> 14:25.217
I hope this can be a little help".

14:25.572 --> 14:29.656
We have some ad revenues.

14:29.824 --> 14:31.615
Let's stop taking donation.

14:31.616 --> 14:33.700
Just say thank you, moron.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.280
The more, the better.

14:38.824 --> 14:39.908
Are you okay?

14:48.032 --> 14:50.324
OK, then let's take it.

14:51.608 --> 14:56.400
So, our topic of the day is...

14:56.608 --> 15:00.148
Should we beat up the journalist Jang

15:00.356 --> 15:02.608
who denounced socialists?

15:02.692 --> 15:05.023
What do you think?

15:05.024 --> 15:08.191
We know what to do. Who was...

15:08.192 --> 15:13.023
- Remember the guy the other day?
- The chief editor?

15:13.024 --> 15:16.272
We should beat him up like the last time.

15:16.856 --> 15:17.856
Hasuyo.

15:19.356 --> 15:21.524
Your boyfriend can beat him up.

15:23.608 --> 15:26.900
Leave it, Hasuyo. They're not fighting.

15:28.732 --> 15:32.316
How come you guys squabble all the time?

15:36.356 --> 15:40.400
I forgot what I was talking
about, you stupid morons.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.771
- Beating.
- Right, beating.

15:43.772 --> 15:45.856
So, you're all for beating?

15:48.192 --> 15:49.400
Wait.

15:51.356 --> 15:56.772
Do we really need to beat him
for denouncing socialists?

15:57.272 --> 16:00.980
We're not a reckless gang, are we?

16:04.440 --> 16:08.856
Anarchists should behave
according to their own will.

16:09.356 --> 16:10.356
Sure.

16:10.608 --> 16:13.440
Actions must be taken
according to individual will.

16:14.524 --> 16:15.979
I agree.

16:15.980 --> 16:21.148
Those of you who agree
can beat him up as you wish.

16:28.564 --> 16:29.564
Jung-han.

16:32.108 --> 16:34.524
Let's cancel the plan to Shanghai.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.980
Why? You told me to go.

16:37.192 --> 16:39.772
Do you hang with Hasuyo often?

16:43.980 --> 16:45.232
Once in a while. Why?

16:46.272 --> 16:48.399
Did you tell her you're going to Shanghai?

16:48.400 --> 16:51.732
What's she have to do
with me bringing bombs?

16:52.064 --> 16:54.608
Don't go. The plan is canceled.

16:58.608 --> 16:59.816
You don't trust me?

17:04.400 --> 17:06.271
Of course, I trust you.

17:06.771 --> 17:08.900
- It's just I wasn't cautious.
- Bullshit.

17:10.271 --> 17:11.856
You don't trust me.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.316
Jung-han...

17:13.340 --> 17:16.344
Park, what's wrong?

17:17.771 --> 17:19.647
- Hey.
- Hasuyo, let's go!

17:39.272 --> 17:40.316
Park.

17:43.816 --> 17:48.440
Why didn't you tell me about the bomb?

17:48.940 --> 17:51.732
I was going to tell you once I have it.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.732
You make all those plans
and leave me out of them?

17:57.356 --> 17:58.979
No, listen to me.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.900
Read that agreement again.

18:02.192 --> 18:05.980
If you don't count me as your comrade,

18:07.108 --> 18:09.108
I can't be with you.

18:09.980 --> 18:10.980
All right.

18:14.692 --> 18:16.816
Damn, it hurts.

18:34.016 --> 18:35.016
Stop right there.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.180
Don't eat it, it's for sale.

18:40.848 --> 18:43.140
This is for your own good too.

18:45.264 --> 18:47.100
What about your work?

18:47.348 --> 18:49.100
Why are you fooling around?

18:50.140 --> 18:52.764
I quit. I fought with a customer.

18:54.180 --> 18:57.392
Leftover newspapers?
I'll go sell them off.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.808
This one is strong. Cover the ginseng.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.808
Sir, are you all right?

19:58.140 --> 20:00.531
The new prime minister
hasn't been appointed.

20:00.556 --> 20:03.359
The Minister of Foreign Affairs
will chair the meeting

20:11.140 --> 20:14.392
11:59 a.m. today,

20:14.756 --> 20:23.256
an earthquake of magnitude 7.9
hit Kanto area including Tokyo.

20:23.600 --> 20:31.680
We reckon over 0.1 million died,
and 0.2 million lost their houses.

20:32.264 --> 20:37.516
And property loss will
cost up to 10 billion yen.

20:38.016 --> 20:39.516
Why is it so hot here?

20:40.972 --> 20:45.600
There's fire all over Tokyo.
It's 46°C outside.

20:47.016 --> 20:49.680
Army Chief, what's the recovery plan?

20:50.016 --> 20:55.432
The situation is grim, but
we'll do our very best.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.964
How long will it take?

20:58.840 --> 21:01.800
Sir, I am Army Chief

21:02.172 --> 21:06.048
I believe that can be answered
by the Interior Minister...

21:09.216 --> 21:12.132
Recovery isn't our priority.

21:12.548 --> 21:14.800
What's the priority then?

21:15.632 --> 21:20.672
We need countermeasures first.

21:25.256 --> 21:26.256
Fumiko!

21:29.340 --> 21:30.716
We're okay.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.632
Thank God

21:36.592 --> 21:38.008
I'm relieved.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.632
It's all crazy now.

21:42.132 --> 21:43.755
It's only an earthquake.

21:43.756 --> 21:46.048
Don't make a fuss.

21:46.592 --> 21:51.464
I mean people are at the Imperial Palace,

21:51.716 --> 21:54.464
demanding measures to be made.

21:54.548 --> 21:57.132
It might lead to a riot in a minute.

21:57.508 --> 22:01.716
Riot? How exciting!!

22:02.340 --> 22:05.508
They won't let a riot happen.

22:05.924 --> 22:06.924
Who?

22:08.216 --> 22:11.840
The emperor and his gangs.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.840
Once again, appointed
by his majesty the King

22:24.172 --> 22:26.464
as Prime Minister,

22:27.632 --> 22:30.092
Yamamoto Gonnohyoe.

22:34.132 --> 22:37.216
Minister of Interior, enlighten
us with your measures

22:38.880 --> 22:43.048
I've just been appointed today...

22:43.632 --> 22:48.008
How about hearing from the
former Minister of Interior?

23:00.924 --> 23:06.840
Hundreds of people were gathered around.

23:07.172 --> 23:10.300
Yasukuni Shrine and Ueno Park.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.755
Before they begin the riot,

23:13.756 --> 23:16.424
we need to impose martial law.

23:16.880 --> 23:23.632
Martial law can be imposed
only in wartime or civil war.

23:23.964 --> 23:26.924
Have you forgotten the
rice riot 5 years ago?

23:27.300 --> 23:31.424
Martial law without reason
might trigger a civil war.

23:32.132 --> 23:34.300
Of course, we have a reason.

23:36.008 --> 23:38.092
What do you mean?

23:40.940 --> 23:43.772
Koreans are poisoning the wells in town.

23:46.856 --> 23:49.856
What are you talking about?

23:51.480 --> 23:55.272
In this chaos, Koreans are poisoning wells

23:55.608 --> 23:59.108
and setting fire everywhere.

23:59.692 --> 24:03.856
Who told you that?

24:06.323 --> 24:08.363
Someone told me.

24:10.207 --> 24:12.831
You were bombed and dismissed

24:12.856 --> 24:15.816
after March 1st Movement in Korea, 1919.

24:16.564 --> 24:21.480
Aren't you saying those things

24:21.900 --> 24:27.272
out of personal anger and
hatred against Koreans?

24:30.356 --> 24:33.064
Does it really matter now?

24:33.900 --> 24:38.024
What matters is that they're
poisoning our wells.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.272
In the wake of the earthquake,
Koreans are setting fire,

24:44.608 --> 24:50.900
throwing bombs at major
facilities and officials.

24:51.638 --> 24:54.554
Minister of Justice,
what if a riot occurs?

24:54.772 --> 24:59.064
Will you take the blame?

25:01.892 --> 25:09.392
Who'll calm down the angry
crowds in front of the palace?

25:09.724 --> 25:12.972
Shouldn't we protect his majesty the King?

25:13.308 --> 25:14.516
Otherwise!

25:17.972 --> 25:20.972
We'll be the target.

25:29.892 --> 25:33.972
I appoint Army Chief Yamanashi

25:34.308 --> 25:37.056
as the martial law commander.

25:37.386 --> 25:38.386
Yes, sir!

25:38.764 --> 25:42.567
Former Interior Minister Mizuno,

25:43.556 --> 25:46.432
Emergency Chief, and Police Commissioner!

25:46.613 --> 25:53.180
You're in charge of relief
works and public order.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
Yes, sir!

25:56.264 --> 26:02.140
<i>Martial law is declared
as of 6 p.m., September 2nd.</i>

26:02.808 --> 26:08.931
<i>A number of Korean rebels
are mustering radicals.</i>

26:08.932 --> 26:17.348
<i>Veterans association, firefighters,
and young men's associations</i>

26:17.640 --> 26:22.348
<i>should stay vigilant and take
measures in contingencies.</i>

26:26.180 --> 26:28.056
Fifteen bucks, fifty cents.

26:28.640 --> 26:29.891
Say it.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.472
Don't be afraid.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.348
Say it.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.056
Fifteen bucks.

26:41.264 --> 26:42.556
Peept... buuk.

26:46.016 --> 26:47.224
Fifty cents.

26:47.972 --> 26:51.892
Peep...

26:52.724 --> 26:54.432
Dirty Korean!

26:55.224 --> 26:57.472
Stop, dirty Koreans!

26:58.764 --> 27:00.432
Help! Please!

27:01.754 --> 27:02.892
We're in big trouble.

27:03.432 --> 27:07.056
Jeong and Choi are arrested.

27:07.308 --> 27:10.472
Police is arresting every Korean they see.

27:10.556 --> 27:12.100
Sons of bitches.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.264
This is the den for socialist commies.

27:18.308 --> 27:19.724
Open up!

27:20.432 --> 27:22.535
<i>- Hey, open up!</i>
- Let's run to the back.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.308
<i>Open up now!</i>

27:25.016 --> 27:26.645
Come on, hurry up!

27:27.680 --> 27:29.224
I'll get arrested.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.600
What do you mean?

27:33.348 --> 27:36.600
It's safer to be locked
in the police station.

27:37.516 --> 27:40.724
The vigilantes are killing
our people anyway.

27:40.932 --> 27:45.264
You are saying it's better
to walk into the police?

27:45.348 --> 27:49.516
Tell every member to meet at
the Setagaya police station.

27:50.224 --> 27:51.472
Let me go with you.

27:53.348 --> 27:54.932
You're a Japanese.

27:57.724 --> 27:59.680
Kazuo, you stay too.

28:01.472 --> 28:02.600
Okay, let's go.

28:10.892 --> 28:13.472
Koreans Spray Poison into Waterworks

28:13.808 --> 28:19.308
300 Prisoners Escape and
Launch Riot with Koreans

28:19.556 --> 28:23.808
400 Korean Rebels Arrested

28:29.764 --> 28:32.972
Koreans are being slaughtered
indiscriminately.

28:33.264 --> 28:37.391
Is that so? I've never heard of it.

28:37.392 --> 28:41.263
If other countries find this
out, we'll be condemned.

28:41.264 --> 28:44.263
Are you going to announce it to the world?

28:44.264 --> 28:46.180
Do you think you can cover this up?

28:46.556 --> 28:50.639
This is a means of self-defense

28:50.640 --> 28:52.679
for the Japanese people.

28:52.680 --> 28:56.056
The Japanese Empire
isn't a barbaric nation.

28:56.585 --> 28:57.893
We have laws and orders...

28:57.918 --> 29:02.308
It's your job to protect
laws and orders

29:02.840 --> 29:07.508
I'll protect my country,
my people, and my emperor.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.048
Then...

29:10.256 --> 29:15.548
I'll resign from the Ministry of Justice.

29:29.964 --> 29:35.300
If this station collapses,
we'll all end up dead.

29:36.092 --> 29:39.880
I can't believe we just walked
into the police station.

29:39.964 --> 29:42.216
They say we poisoned the wells?

29:42.800 --> 29:44.340
Then, let's poison them!

29:44.880 --> 29:47.840
We set fire? Then, let us set fire!

29:48.464 --> 29:52.592
We're not against the Japanese people.

30:00.924 --> 30:04.671
Let me get inside! The
vigilantes are here.

30:04.672 --> 30:07.380
They're killing every
single Korean they see.

30:07.716 --> 30:08.592
What's police doing?

30:08.632 --> 30:10.092
They're ignoring us.

30:10.380 --> 30:12.840
Please, open up.

30:13.924 --> 30:16.508
Please help!

30:24.340 --> 30:26.424
All of you.

30:27.464 --> 30:29.340
You're Koreans, right?

30:30.380 --> 30:31.464
Am I right?

30:33.840 --> 30:36.008
Fifteen bucks, fifty cents.

30:37.132 --> 30:38.592
Say it.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.508
Hey, you.

30:48.592 --> 30:49.840
Say it.

30:53.092 --> 30:55.172
Fuck off! You fucking asshole.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.592
Yeah, I'm fucking Korean,
you motherfucker.

31:02.672 --> 31:04.840
Stop and get out now.

31:05.216 --> 31:07.423
Why are you protecting dirty Koreans?

31:07.424 --> 31:09.800
Get out, right now!

31:10.132 --> 31:12.355
We helped you get rid of the barbarians.

31:12.380 --> 31:17.256
It's for the good of our country.

31:26.464 --> 31:28.508
Things are getting serious.

31:28.800 --> 31:33.964
Thousands of Koreans have been arrested.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.507
We have no more facilities to keep them.

31:36.508 --> 31:40.880
What did I say? It's okay to kill them.

31:41.716 --> 31:45.048
The vigilantes have already
begun to slaughter them.

31:45.380 --> 31:49.508
Massacre is spreading to
Gunma and Saitama areas.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.840
<i>Koreans slaughtered in Gunma and Saitama.</i>

31:58.964 --> 32:02.300
This shouldn't be in papers.
Stop them run this headline!

32:02.424 --> 32:03.424
Yes, sir!

32:05.800 --> 32:08.716
<i>430 Koreans Massacred in Kanto</i>

32:09.258 --> 32:11.386
Is this number accurate?

32:11.712 --> 32:14.668
That's the official number now.

32:14.716 --> 32:18.172
The number's reaching
almost 6,000 nationwide.

32:22.256 --> 32:25.672
Six... thousand?

32:27.548 --> 32:29.839
It's quite a lot of number
within three days

32:29.840 --> 32:31.756
after the earthquake.

32:44.340 --> 32:47.508
Pick one from those locked in the station.

32:47.592 --> 32:49.048
Which one?

32:51.292 --> 32:53.123
One who is a hero to Koreans,

32:53.124 --> 32:56.208
and an enemy to us

32:59.832 --> 33:00.832
Jin-yu!

33:01.708 --> 33:02.708
Fumiko?

33:04.080 --> 33:05.580
How are you doing, guys?

33:05.872 --> 33:08.580
What are you doing here?

33:09.832 --> 33:11.416
I'm one of <i>The Revolt,</i> too.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.956
So, you voluntarily walked in?

33:14.624 --> 33:15.624
That's right.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.956
You're nuts.

33:25.124 --> 33:26.624
I'm here too.

33:35.164 --> 33:36.164
Park.

33:37.664 --> 33:38.664
Yeah?

33:40.416 --> 33:42.372
I can't find Hasuyo.

33:43.332 --> 33:44.664
How about Jung-han?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.832
He said he'd go back to Korea.

33:48.372 --> 33:50.208
Don't worry.

33:51.208 --> 33:54.872
They're both our members, too.

33:57.248 --> 34:02.080
The other day, she asked
me to quit <i>The Revolt.</i>

34:03.040 --> 34:05.372
She said it's all useless.

34:06.248 --> 34:10.540
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't say a word.

34:11.916 --> 34:13.916
I slapped her in the face.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.956
<i>Setagaya Police Station</i>

34:19.040 --> 34:23.792
<i>Who was your target?</i>

34:23.916 --> 34:25.331
Tell me.

34:36.956 --> 34:38.040
Give me the name.

34:55.208 --> 34:59.540
Old habits die hard, huh?

35:17.580 --> 35:21.164
When I bring a bomb from Shanghai,

35:22.372 --> 35:25.040
Park Yeol said he'd throw it.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.164
Are you happy now?

35:30.208 --> 35:33.080
For the revolution to happen,

35:35.080 --> 35:37.208
they said

35:38.637 --> 35:41.792
this autumn is perfect.

35:43.580 --> 35:44.832
Are you sure?

35:47.372 --> 35:48.664
All right.

35:53.527 --> 35:56.027
We've got detailed statements.

35:56.164 --> 35:58.872
They didn't torture him, did they?

36:01.248 --> 36:05.832
- They...
- No torture, right?

36:09.416 --> 36:12.039
They never laid hands on him.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.872
Good...

36:14.812 --> 36:16.144
So,

36:17.116 --> 36:19.199
A group called <i>The Revolt</i>

36:19.200 --> 36:22.864
tried to buy a bomb from Shanghai?

36:23.200 --> 36:26.200
Did they get it or not?

36:26.948 --> 36:29.072
It seems like they failed, sir.

36:30.572 --> 36:32.864
They might have obtained it.

36:34.616 --> 36:36.156
So...

36:37.364 --> 36:40.656
What was their target?

36:42.780 --> 36:45.700
They planned for this autumn.

36:48.492 --> 36:53.864
Do we have any event in the autumn?

36:55.780 --> 36:57.864
Who's the leader?

37:03.908 --> 37:05.408
Minister of Justice Hiranuma.

37:07.364 --> 37:11.364
We have a big project for you.

37:12.616 --> 37:14.992
Have you heard about <i>The Revolt?</i>

37:15.324 --> 37:21.908
Isn't that a group of socialist
Koreans living in Japan?

37:22.332 --> 37:27.780
We use the word "rebels"
to call unruly Koreans.

37:28.116 --> 37:32.200
Now, they named their
group after that word.

37:33.324 --> 37:36.824
They're clearly mocking us.

37:38.948 --> 37:42.864
I want you to take this case.

37:47.780 --> 37:50.032
I'll do my best, sir.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.863
Prosecute them and

37:52.864 --> 37:56.532
interrogate them with justice.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.324
Yes, sir.

37:59.908 --> 38:02.364
Make it reasonable,

38:02.793 --> 38:08.832
but the conclusion is decided.

38:12.032 --> 38:13.116
Excuse me?

38:14.200 --> 38:19.740
A conclusion that Korean
socialists erupted riots

38:20.072 --> 38:25.240
in the confusion following the earthquake.

38:30.864 --> 38:32.364
Setting me free already?

38:32.864 --> 38:34.364
You're going to the prison.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.740
For what crime?

38:38.364 --> 38:42.200
You are charged with a
violation of security law.

38:43.864 --> 38:45.532
Is that it?

38:47.324 --> 38:49.156
Get off me.

38:49.532 --> 38:51.448
I'll go by myself.

38:55.116 --> 38:58.116
Why do you take him alone? What about us?

38:58.448 --> 39:00.908
Don't know. I only follow orders.

39:03.616 --> 39:05.364
Don't tag along this time.

39:07.116 --> 39:08.448
Understood?

39:13.840 --> 39:18.340
Take me with him! I did it too!

39:20.256 --> 39:22.048
You did what?

39:22.450 --> 39:23.964
Whatever.

39:26.172 --> 39:28.172
Take me, too!

Korean Rebels Arrested

for Attempted Assassin of

40:13.132 --> 40:17.800
Government Official in Tokyo.

40:21.800 --> 40:29.300
Now that press control
of the massacre is lifted,

40:29.632 --> 40:32.964
The first news to come up is.

40:33.172 --> 40:36.172
"Arrest of the Secret Korean Organization."

40:39.400 --> 40:40.856
Mizuno!

40:42.400 --> 40:44.732
Was this your idea?

40:45.064 --> 40:47.440
I think Heaven helped us.

40:52.940 --> 40:56.024
We declared that Koreans started a riot,

40:57.648 --> 40:59.732
without any evidence.

41:02.192 --> 41:06.564
That could've caused us a problem, right?

41:07.524 --> 41:12.400
Now, here we have the evidence.

41:12.863 --> 41:20.130
They did plan to buy a bomb
to kill a government official.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.855
Welcome to Ichigaya prison,

41:28.856 --> 41:32.480
The door won't open until you die.

41:32.816 --> 41:37.480
The door will open soon.
Wanna bet on your emperor?

41:41.024 --> 41:43.271
What a lunatic.

41:43.272 --> 41:45.480
No, you're a lunatic.

41:45.692 --> 41:48.192
You think your emperor is God?

41:49.618 --> 41:50.618
What?

41:52.900 --> 41:58.400
He's only a human. He pees and poos.

41:58.732 --> 42:02.940
And he's fucking short like a dwarf.

42:08.980 --> 42:10.648
See?

42:10.980 --> 42:12.900
I told you it'll open.

42:17.907 --> 42:21.155
Isn't it nice here? We can eat and sleep.

42:21.272 --> 42:22.899
- Fumiko, see you later.
- Yes.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.349
- Count the stars to sleep.
- Okay.

42:27.316 --> 42:30.192
Fumiko, eat well.

42:38.232 --> 42:40.400
You must be crazier,

42:40.732 --> 42:44.608
to come here for that lunatic.

42:45.732 --> 42:46.856
My room?

43:05.272 --> 43:09.192
Don't be nervous. Have a seat

43:09.480 --> 43:13.064
I'm not nervous. Are you?

43:15.816 --> 43:17.272
This is my seat?

43:21.184 --> 43:24.932
Can you speak Japanese?

43:25.242 --> 43:29.410
I can, but I'll only speak Korean.

43:31.948 --> 43:36.156
This is a courtroom in Japan.
You have to talk in Japanese.

43:38.656 --> 43:41.032
Then I won't say a word.

43:45.492 --> 43:46.700
Sit.

43:51.864 --> 43:55.780
It could bring you some disadvantage.

43:56.492 --> 43:58.240
You know Korean.

44:00.908 --> 44:02.324
You understand my words.

44:04.448 --> 44:06.072
Actually,

44:06.532 --> 44:08.532
I've learned it for a while.

44:09.780 --> 44:13.364
I know only one reason why
you people learn Korean.

44:13.740 --> 44:20.072
To work in the poor colony and
climb the ladder of success here?

44:21.072 --> 44:23.656
Don't judge me like that.

44:25.992 --> 44:30.156
You can make this a lot
easier by talking in Korean.

44:36.032 --> 44:39.240
Then let's use our own language.

44:42.656 --> 44:43.992
How old are you?

44:44.310 --> 44:45.740
Why are you asking?

44:45.948 --> 44:47.448
Come on, tell me.

44:49.616 --> 44:51.700
Thirty-one.

44:53.908 --> 44:55.408
Older than me.

44:56.908 --> 45:00.740
Feel free to talk down to me.

45:04.780 --> 45:08.072
If you say so.

45:08.408 --> 45:10.408
What's my charge?

45:15.215 --> 45:20.883
You've been charged for
mustering anarchists

45:20.908 --> 45:23.739
and organizing a secret group

45:23.740 --> 45:26.992
for armed socialist movement.

45:27.324 --> 45:30.032
Fujishita!

45:30.408 --> 45:31.740
Fujishita!

45:32.780 --> 45:33.864
Fujishita!

45:35.616 --> 45:37.072
What?

45:37.656 --> 45:38.992
Got a pen and paper?

45:39.740 --> 45:41.616
Writing your will already?

45:44.448 --> 45:47.656
I guess I'll write a letter of apology.

45:47.992 --> 45:49.532
Apology?

45:49.700 --> 45:52.779
You regret doing crazy things

45:52.780 --> 45:54.364
with that Korean dog, huh?

45:54.948 --> 45:58.280
I'll give you every detail

45:58.616 --> 46:00.992
about what I did with him.

46:03.992 --> 46:05.364
Name.

46:06.740 --> 46:08.324
Park Jun-sik.

46:08.572 --> 46:10.700
People call me Park Yeol.

46:12.310 --> 46:13.850
Age?

46:14.532 --> 46:16.616
9 years younger than you.

46:20.780 --> 46:22.448
Twenty-two.

46:22.532 --> 46:24.072
Occupation?

46:28.532 --> 46:31.656
Let's call it a magazine publisher.

46:32.700 --> 46:34.572
You can write that down.

46:39.072 --> 46:40.571
Address?

46:40.572 --> 46:45.656
1474 Yoyogi-tomigaya,
Toyotama District, Tokyo.

46:46.017 --> 46:47.601
Place of birth?

46:50.324 --> 46:55.864
98 Ocheon-ri, Mungyeong,
Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea.

46:59.656 --> 47:02.408
Who are you living with?

47:05.913 --> 47:07.705
Kaneko Fumiko.

47:15.992 --> 47:18.948
Are you living with Park Yeol?

47:20.433 --> 47:21.225
Yes.

47:21.324 --> 47:23.408
Are you registered as his wife?

47:23.880 --> 47:25.256
No, I'm not.

47:25.656 --> 47:28.740
We both didn't want that.

47:29.072 --> 47:31.740
Why did you go to Korea?

47:32.116 --> 47:36.992
When I was 9, I went to my
grandma's to do housekeeping.

47:37.566 --> 47:39.814
Why was that?

47:44.780 --> 47:47.116
My parents abandoned me.

47:49.700 --> 47:54.492
When did you return to Japan?

47:55.200 --> 47:57.864
Right after March 1st Movement.

47:58.324 --> 48:00.324
How did you meet Park Yeol?

48:01.816 --> 48:03.272
<i>Damn Dog.</i>

48:03.816 --> 48:04.980
What's that?

48:08.648 --> 48:12.732
I read his poem <i>"Damn Dog"</i>

48:13.064 --> 48:15.400
and fell in love with him.

48:16.272 --> 48:20.440
<i>"Damn dog"</i> is the title of his poem?

48:20.816 --> 48:22.064
Right.

48:25.356 --> 48:26.356
All right.

48:27.608 --> 48:29.108
Damn dog.

48:33.772 --> 48:35.400
I was reciting the poem.

48:35.900 --> 48:37.856
Just answer my question.

48:38.816 --> 48:40.480
Okay, sir.

48:45.900 --> 48:49.232
You are the founder of <i>The Revolt?</i>

48:50.024 --> 48:51.024
That's right.

48:51.316 --> 48:55.272
<i>The Revolt</i> is a Korean socialist
group, is this correct?

48:56.108 --> 48:59.440
No, <i>The Revolt</i> is an anarchist group.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.024
And you're the leader of that group?

49:06.564 --> 49:07.648
That's correct.

49:12.524 --> 49:16.316
Were you leading the
plan to obtain a bomb?

49:26.064 --> 49:29.272
Bomb? What bomb?

49:30.816 --> 49:36.732
The bomb you asked Jung-han
to pick up from Shanghai.

49:41.192 --> 49:42.732
Let me ask you again.

49:42.980 --> 49:47.480
Did you set up the plan?

49:49.536 --> 49:53.856
Get me a lawyer, or
I won't say a single word.

49:57.856 --> 50:02.772
Were you aware of
Park's plan to get a bomb?

50:06.400 --> 50:07.772
Yes, I knew.

50:09.316 --> 50:10.564
Are you sure?

50:11.608 --> 50:16.108
Of course. We planned it together.

50:19.732 --> 50:23.648
Any specific venue or date?

50:26.064 --> 50:27.900
Just as Park said.

50:30.564 --> 50:33.148
He didn't say a word.

50:39.192 --> 50:40.316
Now...

50:48.648 --> 50:50.316
Get me a lawyer.

51:03.316 --> 51:05.732
Jung-han blew the bomb plan.

51:07.832 --> 51:08.956
I know.

51:12.064 --> 51:14.400
They'll frame us all.

51:15.108 --> 51:17.064
Someone needs to take the blame.

51:17.192 --> 51:19.024
- What?
- Someone?

51:19.732 --> 51:22.980
Are you saying you'll hold the bag?

51:23.108 --> 51:26.272
Jung-han mentioned only about me.

51:26.400 --> 51:32.524
None of you knew or heard
about the bomb, okay?

51:33.316 --> 51:36.564
What are you gonna do on your own?

51:38.608 --> 51:41.316
I'll be the hero as they planned.

51:49.564 --> 51:53.272
Shut the fuck up, dirty Koreans!

51:55.016 --> 51:57.308
From now on, I'll tell you everything.

51:58.556 --> 52:02.308
Who else was involved in the plan?

52:03.056 --> 52:05.432
Other members don't know about it.

52:06.848 --> 52:08.392
You planned it on your own?

52:09.600 --> 52:10.640
Correct.

52:15.100 --> 52:17.432
Who was the target?

52:19.392 --> 52:22.016
Your prince, Michinomiya.

52:24.056 --> 52:25.348
What did you say?

52:28.264 --> 52:35.848
Prince Hirohito's childhood name.
Ironically, "Michinomiya" means

52:36.016 --> 52:37.808
"crazy bitch" in Korean.

52:39.224 --> 52:44.180
Do you have any idea what
your statement means?

52:47.932 --> 52:53.264
I know for sure it'll be the
biggest case in your life.

52:54.224 --> 52:55.640
<i>Prime Minister,</i>

52:55.892 --> 52:57.892
an act of treason has occurred.

52:59.348 --> 53:00.348
What?

53:00.764 --> 53:02.867
Park Yeol, the leader of
the group <i>The Revolt,</i>

53:02.892 --> 53:06.180
planned to assassin Prince Hirohito.

53:06.516 --> 53:08.555
Is he alive?

53:08.556 --> 53:10.472
Yes, he's alive.

53:10.810 --> 53:14.100
How grateful! God protected our prince.

53:15.100 --> 53:17.348
Did the bullet miss him?

53:17.636 --> 53:19.823
It's not a bullet. It's a bomb.

53:19.848 --> 53:21.348
A bomb?

53:22.180 --> 53:24.016
It didn't go off?

53:24.041 --> 53:28.665
The d-day was the prince's wedding day.

53:29.016 --> 53:33.932
But the wedding was postponed
because of the earthquake.

53:34.224 --> 53:38.432
The earthquake saved the prince!

53:40.172 --> 53:45.172
So you're saying there
was only a conspiracy.

53:48.432 --> 53:51.556
If not the earthquake,
Park would have done it.

53:58.816 --> 54:03.272
Attempted assassin of the prince...

54:03.858 --> 54:05.274
This Korean...

54:06.100 --> 54:09.892
...actually tried to murder
the prince with a bomb.

54:10.224 --> 54:12.308
He's definitely a traitor!

54:17.048 --> 54:20.756
You have evidence and witnesses?

54:21.092 --> 54:23.880
We have his confession.

54:24.716 --> 54:30.672
Did you know Park was going to
throw a bomb at the prince?

54:33.508 --> 54:34.716
What did he say?

54:34.924 --> 54:38.840
- Answer the question.
- Answer me first.

54:40.964 --> 54:44.132
He said other members
didn't know about the plan.

54:47.048 --> 54:48.964
Any word about me?

54:57.763 --> 55:08.387
"My statement about Fumiko
might offend her feelings."

55:10.008 --> 55:13.380
"So I'll let her make
decisions on her own."

55:22.800 --> 55:23.840
Fumiko,

55:27.008 --> 55:32.840
I'm willing to help you as a Japanese.

55:33.256 --> 55:35.464
Did Park threaten you?

55:35.632 --> 55:38.716
Or, does he have something on you?

55:42.264 --> 55:44.888
I threatened him.

55:46.008 --> 55:47.172
What?

55:50.271 --> 55:54.592
I taught Park that we
don't need an emperor

55:54.924 --> 55:59.632
that we shouldn't have one
from the first place.

56:00.340 --> 56:02.132
In other words,

56:02.964 --> 56:04.592
I was his...

56:05.216 --> 56:07.508
private tutor.

56:09.308 --> 56:12.100
<i>Iron Fist, Smashers, Bloody Fists.</i>

56:12.424 --> 56:15.716
<i>Black Daggers, Black Comrades, The Revolt.</i>

56:17.424 --> 56:20.419
These are organizations
you've joined or made so far,

56:20.632 --> 56:22.132
right?

56:22.464 --> 56:25.964
Did I make that many?

56:26.092 --> 56:27.216
It seems to me,

56:27.424 --> 56:28.923
you're just eager to

56:28.924 --> 56:30.924
make yourself famous.

56:31.216 --> 56:32.548
Am I wrong?

56:36.172 --> 56:38.800
I only live for myself.

56:39.771 --> 56:41.300
What do you mean?

56:42.840 --> 56:46.924
I eat when I'm hungry.
I do it when I want it.

56:48.380 --> 56:49.840
Do it?

56:51.632 --> 56:52.840
Do what?

56:53.632 --> 56:55.424
Intercourse.

56:56.756 --> 56:57.964
Don't you know?

56:58.880 --> 57:02.132
To make love.

57:02.924 --> 57:05.424
Answer my questions seriously.

57:09.380 --> 57:11.132
Seriously?

57:16.548 --> 57:20.216
You wanna know why I tried
to kill the prince?

57:21.672 --> 57:26.508
Nation, people, monarch.

57:26.840 --> 57:30.756
These are only theoretical concepts.

57:31.092 --> 57:37.482
You gave power and holiness
to those mere concepts

57:37.592 --> 57:40.508
and created an emperor and prince.

57:44.916 --> 57:46.748
Humans,

57:47.164 --> 57:53.591
all of us are entitled to equal
rights as a human being.

57:53.664 --> 57:57.792
The very devils who destroy
the equal world are

57:58.124 --> 58:00.664
the Emperor and the Prince.

58:02.916 --> 58:04.248
Devils?

58:04.916 --> 58:07.164
Therefore,

58:08.416 --> 58:10.664
they shall be demolished.

58:12.792 --> 58:16.416
We're living with a parasite Emperor,

58:16.500 --> 58:20.792
who is harming the peace of mankind.

58:21.748 --> 58:23.164
Parasite?

58:23.580 --> 58:29.792
It's my dream to destroy not only Japan,

58:30.708 --> 58:32.916
but the whole fucking world.

58:46.792 --> 58:49.490
- What about Park?
- Why are we out?

58:51.956 --> 58:54.748
We're kicking you out, morons.

58:58.872 --> 59:01.580
Remember the attorney Huse?

59:02.248 --> 59:06.416
The pro bono lawyer
who defended us last time?

59:06.864 --> 59:08.784
Let's ask him one more time.

59:09.580 --> 59:10.624
Are you okay?

59:12.332 --> 59:15.708
This case will be much tougher than

59:16.040 --> 59:21.416
the previous laborer cases
like Choi and Baek.

59:22.411 --> 59:25.664
Please... we need your help, sir.

59:29.292 --> 59:33.124
They're likely to put them on a trial

59:33.456 --> 59:36.080
for a treason.

59:36.292 --> 59:39.956
Which means... a death penalty?

59:43.832 --> 59:47.040
We have to stop it from happening.

59:47.416 --> 59:49.208
Thank you very much.

59:57.248 --> 01:00:02.540
You must be busy defending labor workers.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.664
This case was clearly fabricated.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.208
I'll stop the prosecution.

01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:13.664
There's no need for it.
I've admitted my charge.

01:00:14.164 --> 01:00:16.748
Unlike political prisoners,

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.372
traitors are punished only by death.

01:00:20.332 --> 01:00:25.208
Death penalty can't shut my mouth up.

01:00:29.456 --> 01:00:32.000
If you go too close to the truth,

01:00:32.332 --> 01:00:34.292
you'll get closer to death.

01:00:41.956 --> 01:00:46.580
Please withdraw your advocacy.

01:00:48.832 --> 01:00:55.664
You'll be the first Korean
charged with treason.

01:00:59.332 --> 01:01:00.748
Treason?

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:04.872
It's treason to Japanese.

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:10.292
But if this is what I
should do as a Korean,

01:01:10.624 --> 01:01:12.000
I'll be more than glad

01:01:13.456 --> 01:01:15.580
to be a traitor.

01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:19.540
<i>Destroy! Destroy everything!</i>

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:22.624
<i>Set fire! Throw a bomb!</i>

01:01:22.832 --> 01:01:26.872
<i>Spread poison! Destroy the whole world.</i>

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:33.164
I will wash out the world

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:37.248
tainted by hideous mankind
in crimson blood.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.664
And I, too, will die in destruction.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500
What a fucking lunatic.

01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:48.624
They both seem deranged.

01:01:49.824 --> 01:01:52.864
They should undergo a psychiatric
test before the trial.

01:01:55.032 --> 01:01:56.656
Psychiatric test?

01:01:57.572 --> 01:02:00.199
In the West, they let the criminals

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.824
take the test before punishing them.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.992
What if the result says they're mad?

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:10.532
I don't give a shit about their brain.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.740
Just make them normal, no matter what!

01:02:20.156 --> 01:02:23.448
The prince has been shot.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.280
<i>Police Commissioner!</i>

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:27.992
Are you fucking out of your mind?

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.364
Where the fuck were you when
the prince was attacked?

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.280
Who shot him? A Korean? Who?

01:02:38.616 --> 01:02:43.492
It was Namba Diasuke, a son
of a house representative.

01:02:44.656 --> 01:02:47.824
Now even a lawmaker's son is a commie?

01:02:48.408 --> 01:02:51.824
Fucking commies are everywhere.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.864
It's my fault. I'll resign myself.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.324
<i>Namba Daisuke Fires a
Gun at Prince Hirohito.</i>

01:03:11.824 --> 01:03:14.824
Do you know the anarchist
called Namba Daisuke?

01:03:16.448 --> 01:03:20.072
I met him once at a protest on Labor Day.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.700
Did he shoot the prince?

01:03:22.992 --> 01:03:28.364
The shooter chanted "Revolution"
and fired at the prince's car.

01:03:31.023 --> 01:03:32.271
Was it successful?

01:03:34.216 --> 01:03:35.824
Failed.

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:41.908
He should have thrown a
bomb, not a stupid gun.

01:03:48.572 --> 01:03:50.824
At least he put it into action.

01:03:51.364 --> 01:03:55.908
You never had guts for it.

01:03:56.616 --> 01:03:59.116
You couldn't even get a bomb.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.116
Take a psychiatric test first.

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.407
Psychiatric test, my ass.

01:04:06.408 --> 01:04:08.492
And get a lawyer again.

01:04:08.572 --> 01:04:10.531
Charge me for treason!

01:04:10.532 --> 01:04:12.824
You don't fucking deserve it!

01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:30.115
As a result of the shooting,
Yamamoto Cabinet has resigned.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.215
And the next cabinet has been announced.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.864
Matsui as the Foreign Minister.

01:04:37.448 --> 01:04:40.448
Mizuno as the Interior Minister.

01:04:43.448 --> 01:04:45.780
Mizuno, this asshole.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.324
The murderer is in charge
of the internal affairs again.

01:04:52.636 --> 01:04:55.096
Is this the infamous socialist pub?

01:04:55.643 --> 01:04:56.767
Who are you?

01:04:57.732 --> 01:05:00.232
I'm a journalist from Korea.

01:05:05.024 --> 01:05:06.192
<i>Park Yeol and His Lover</i>

01:05:06.217 --> 01:05:08.692
Park's on the paper. I'm so proud of him.

01:05:08.732 --> 01:05:09.940
For what?

01:05:11.564 --> 01:05:13.024
He didn't achieve anything.

01:05:13.692 --> 01:05:16.024
He's just got a bad temper.

01:05:19.024 --> 01:05:20.316
Go on.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:24.648
Besides, I've heard rumors
about him and women.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.148
All these stories about
attracting women...

01:05:27.272 --> 01:05:28.272
What the fuck?

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.024
You're a spy, aren't you?

01:05:31.192 --> 01:05:33.108
Go on with that rubbish!

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.356
You're clearly speaking Korean

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:47.272
but to me, it sounds like Japanese.

01:05:50.732 --> 01:05:53.900
People back home have
high expectations for Park.

01:05:55.232 --> 01:05:58.356
But he's letting the Japanese
cabinet take advantage of him.

01:05:58.564 --> 01:06:01.608
He even seems like he's enjoying it.

01:06:06.356 --> 01:06:09.692
Can't you see this case was designed

01:06:10.356 --> 01:06:12.480
to cover the Korean massacre?

01:06:20.192 --> 01:06:23.524
He needs to prove his innocence,

01:06:24.024 --> 01:06:25.772
but he willingly testified.

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:29.024
Isn't he making a false confession?

01:06:29.608 --> 01:06:31.440
No, that's not true.

01:06:31.648 --> 01:06:33.940
You don't know anything.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:38.356
Park had a plan B to buy a bomb.

01:06:38.692 --> 01:06:39.692
What?

01:06:40.816 --> 01:06:42.064
Keep talking.

01:06:42.184 --> 01:06:46.016
A few days before the earthquake,

01:06:46.148 --> 01:06:49.648
we smuggled a bomb from Shanghai

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.064
and brought it here in Tokyo.

01:06:54.732 --> 01:06:57.732
- So, you did get a bomb.
- Yes.

01:06:58.024 --> 01:07:01.564
- How can you be sure?
- I'm the one who delivered it.

01:07:01.816 --> 01:07:03.816
If not the earthquake,

01:07:03.856 --> 01:07:08.772
we'd have done it before Namba did.

01:07:14.692 --> 01:07:19.272
I wonder why Park never told me that.

01:07:23.232 --> 01:07:25.524
Is there anything you
guys are hiding from me?

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:26.608
Hey.

01:07:27.148 --> 01:07:30.772
If I had a bomb, I'd
have thrown it already.

01:07:31.816 --> 01:07:32.816
And you?

01:07:35.272 --> 01:07:38.439
What are you guys talking about?

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.856
Nothing.

01:07:40.732 --> 01:07:43.732
What are you guys, anyway?

01:07:44.192 --> 01:07:45.480
Us?

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.316
<i>The Revolt!</i>

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.772
Please give her this.

01:08:01.648 --> 01:08:04.272
<i>Emperor and prince are only humans.</i>

01:08:04.772 --> 01:08:08.316
<i>Locked inside the castle

01:08:10.148 --> 01:08:15.356
<i>The Emperor and the prince are

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:19.356
<i>It's not a big deal to

01:08:20.524 --> 01:08:24.479
<i>The emperor is ill and will die soon.</i>

01:08:25.648 --> 01:08:27.564
<i>Our target is the prince.</i>

01:08:28.732 --> 01:08:31.316
<i>Once we get rid of the prince,</i>

01:08:31.856 --> 01:08:35.899
<i>the Japanese will be enlightened.</i>

01:08:41.108 --> 01:08:42.899
You scared me.

01:08:45.392 --> 01:08:46.392
Hey!

01:08:48.015 --> 01:08:50.432
Where's her reply?

01:08:50.764 --> 01:08:54.680
Letters that breach moral ethics

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.015
are censored and destroyed.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:05.015
It is the language that
unites me and Fumiko.

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:11.179
By assuring each other our
thoughts haven't changed,

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.848
we've completed our love.

01:09:13.308 --> 01:09:14.555
Listen.

01:09:15.264 --> 01:09:20.015
Countless commies gave
up their ideology here.

01:09:20.348 --> 01:09:22.892
You'll end up the same.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.848
You'll be grateful for His Majesty

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:34.055
to have granted you as his subject.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:41.392
If you trash the letters again,

01:09:42.264 --> 01:09:45.680
I'm going on a hunger strike.

01:09:47.555 --> 01:09:51.055
How's the apology letter going?

01:09:51.392 --> 01:09:58.556
Everyone here is talking
about the pretty new girl.

01:10:00.308 --> 01:10:02.016
Thanks for the compliment.

01:10:03.392 --> 01:10:11.724
Lustful prisoners are asking
for the key to your cell.

01:10:17.516 --> 01:10:19.971
Kneel down before the emperor

01:10:19.972 --> 01:10:23.972
before you get raped by the barbarians.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.016
You come in first.

01:10:35.224 --> 01:10:41.016
I wonder what people will say about

01:10:41.348 --> 01:10:44.180
a fervent imperialist raping a prisoner.

01:10:46.224 --> 01:10:47.307
Put your clothes on.

01:10:47.308 --> 01:10:48.892
Come on.

01:10:49.224 --> 01:10:52.640
I'll make you a symbol of the brutality

01:10:52.972 --> 01:10:56.848
along with the Japanese Empire.

01:10:57.392 --> 01:10:59.472
Crazy bitch.

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:25.034
Eat it.

<i>Park Yeol on Hunger Strike in Prison</i>

01:11:42.764 --> 01:11:46.615
Are you still banning letters?
I told you to permit it.

01:11:47.172 --> 01:11:49.632
It is my job to censor them.

01:11:49.964 --> 01:11:53.424
Those letters full of anti-imperialism

01:11:53.756 --> 01:11:56.216
<i>are driving me insane.</i>

01:11:57.424 --> 01:11:59.008
Hunger strike?

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.716
What does he want?

01:12:02.256 --> 01:12:04.672
Exchanging letters with Kaneko Fumiko.

01:12:05.924 --> 01:12:10.048
Let him have it, and
prosecute him for treason.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.256
Treason won't work, sir.

01:12:16.256 --> 01:12:18.880
We need to make him a traitor.

01:12:19.172 --> 01:12:21.132
Park is only a wild idealist.

01:12:21.716 --> 01:12:26.964
Are you his lawyer? Interrogate
him, not defend him.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.880
You might regret later.

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.671
What?

01:12:30.672 --> 01:12:34.840
I'm afraid he's planning something

01:12:35.172 --> 01:12:36.592
through the trial.

01:12:37.508 --> 01:12:42.171
Are you saying you're afraid of

01:12:42.172 --> 01:12:44.300
that 'wild idealist'?

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.340
I'll take the responsibility.

01:12:47.672 --> 01:12:51.216
Prosecute him for treason!

01:12:52.256 --> 01:12:54.548
I heard you're on a hunger strike.

01:12:54.924 --> 01:12:56.964
It's not a big deal.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.424
You'll be charged for treason, right?

01:13:01.132 --> 01:13:02.880
Mr. Lee,

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:10.008
can you help me make this trial
a headline news back home?

01:13:14.092 --> 01:13:19.840
The rumor says you're a wild idealist.

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.424
Ideals might seem wild at first.

01:13:24.172 --> 01:13:29.048
That's how Koreans have been
educated and brainwashed.

01:13:30.548 --> 01:13:37.008
I want to show something to
our people through this trial.

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.716
I'll try.

01:13:48.008 --> 01:13:50.464
Can you pass my message?

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.340
"I suggest cohabitation.

01:14:01.092 --> 01:14:05.132
First, we live together as comrades.

01:14:05.632 --> 01:14:12.672
Secondly, we're equals in
the anarchist movement.

01:14:13.464 --> 01:14:20.924
Thirdly, cohabitation ends when
either betrays or joins the power".

01:14:22.964 --> 01:14:24.340
You know what this is.

01:14:27.216 --> 01:14:32.339
It's the cohabitation
agreement he and I made

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.508
when we first met.

01:14:40.474 --> 01:14:45.716
"Though we are apart, I'm fully
aware of you by my side.

01:14:46.632 --> 01:14:50.840
I'm strictly abiding by the vow.

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:59.672
And I have no doubt
you're doing the same".

01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:04.208
A message from Park.

01:15:05.424 --> 01:15:10.340
Any words you have for him?

01:15:13.883 --> 01:15:17.427
That's my boy.

01:15:25.708 --> 01:15:27.415
Thank you for sending my letters

01:15:27.416 --> 01:15:28.792
and letting me eat.

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:33.080
Oh, Mizuno made this happen?

01:15:34.372 --> 01:15:37.580
Pass my gratitude to him.

01:15:38.622 --> 01:15:42.000
This is psychiatrist Sugita.

01:15:42.332 --> 01:15:44.208
Take a psychiatric test.

01:15:44.748 --> 01:15:46.416
What's wrong with my mind?

01:15:47.956 --> 01:15:53.500
Isn't it natural for us to
want to murder the prince?

01:15:54.372 --> 01:15:55.872
I'm normal!

01:15:58.208 --> 01:15:59.499
What's he saying?

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.872
Never mind. I'll make the decision.

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:15.663
You pretend to be fair and
conscientious as a lawyer.

01:16:15.664 --> 01:16:17.500
But that's a self-deception.

01:16:17.832 --> 01:16:19.208
Self-deception?

01:16:22.956 --> 01:16:26.624
You shouldn't have invaded Korea

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:29.708
and massacred our people
in the first place.

01:16:30.124 --> 01:16:32.456
Don't complain that to me.

01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:41.916
What will you do if I refuse the trial?

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.916
But test Fumiko by all means.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.580
I bet she's pretty crazy.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.832
Please cooperate with us.

01:17:00.832 --> 01:17:02.164
How does it work?

01:17:02.416 --> 01:17:08.372
Blood test, urine test,
and a few questions.

01:17:10.664 --> 01:17:13.372
What's the reward?

01:17:14.292 --> 01:17:16.500
We'll issue a certificate.

01:17:19.416 --> 01:17:21.956
No cookies or cake?

01:17:26.164 --> 01:17:29.624
- Do you have any?
- Well...

01:17:30.248 --> 01:17:31.292
You don't?

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.832
You are asking for my
blood and urine for free?

01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:47.372
I'd rather be tortured!

01:17:50.219 --> 01:17:51.595
Fuck off!

01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:59.580
Park says he'd refuse the trial.

01:18:00.292 --> 01:18:06.372
This case won't be closed without
having him in the court.

01:18:08.272 --> 01:18:10.980
Park went on a hunger strike again.

01:18:13.448 --> 01:18:16.116
What's the reason this time?

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.240
What's the problem?

01:18:26.032 --> 01:18:29.572
- I want more rice.
- What?

01:18:30.364 --> 01:18:34.948
Koreans eat more rice
than you Japanese do.

01:18:35.656 --> 01:18:39.992
Are you treating me like a Japanese?

01:18:41.992 --> 01:18:44.864
To me, this is very insulting.

01:18:47.448 --> 01:18:50.908
Okay. You'll get as much as you want.

01:18:51.408 --> 01:18:53.200
That's the right thing.

01:18:53.532 --> 01:18:54.992
Happy now?

01:18:56.156 --> 01:18:59.908
Sorry for making you
come and go so often.

01:19:02.948 --> 01:19:09.364
Since you're here, can
you do me another favor?

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.864
Now, what?

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.572
Get dressed.

01:19:24.532 --> 01:19:25.864
What is this?

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.448
Judge Tatematsu must be insane.

01:19:36.864 --> 01:19:37.908
How do I look?

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:55.740
Park.

01:20:03.908 --> 01:20:05.448
You haven't changed a bit.

01:20:08.532 --> 01:20:11.824
How do I look? Look handsome?

01:20:13.572 --> 01:20:15.532
Even in those new clothes,

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.656
you look shabby just like
the first time we met.

01:20:21.908 --> 01:20:23.656
But you fell for that?

01:20:24.218 --> 01:20:25.386
I did.

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:30.032
I should've worn Korean
traditional clothes.

01:20:30.948 --> 01:20:34.032
What's all this?

01:20:36.448 --> 01:20:40.740
I want to send a picture of
us to my mother in Korea.

01:20:42.992 --> 01:20:44.492
Your mother?

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.280
Look at the camera.

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:18.364
Here we go. One, two, three.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.700
Will you excuse us for a moment?

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.200
All right.

01:21:31.824 --> 01:21:33.992
Let's go, everyone.

01:21:36.116 --> 01:21:38.364
Let's go.

01:21:43.532 --> 01:21:44.532
Thank you.

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:46.072
Good day, sir.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.908
You'll regret this.

01:21:58.216 --> 01:22:02.548
It's the Sun that makes you
take off clothes, not the wind.

01:22:04.756 --> 01:22:08.924
It's obvious what they will do in there.

01:22:10.132 --> 01:22:16.340
Why do you always have to think that way?

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:21.339
Park wanted to send that
picture to his mother

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:24.132
as a good-bye present.

01:22:28.172 --> 01:22:29.964
Are you feeling sorry for them?

01:22:32.092 --> 01:22:34.232
When I think about Fumiko's childhood,

01:22:35.464 --> 01:22:38.256
I kind of understand why

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:42.464
she ended up cursing this world.

01:22:50.092 --> 01:22:55.508
Based on the statements
you made until today,

01:22:55.716 --> 01:23:01.631
You'll be charged with treason
in Article 73 of the Criminal Act.

01:23:01.632 --> 01:23:05.548
The next step will take place
at the Supreme Court.

01:23:07.132 --> 01:23:09.092
Treason, finally.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.208
Good job.

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:31.164
Are you sure about sending
this to your mother?

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:34.500
My mother is open-minded.

01:23:37.748 --> 01:23:39.416
I like this picture

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.208
I'll keep a copy.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.208
Is that a souvenir or a trophy?

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:53.164
This case gave me an opportunity
to investigate a traitor

01:23:53.248 --> 01:23:56.248
and show my loyalty to my country.

01:23:57.372 --> 01:24:01.456
This is the souvenir of my accomplishment.

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:09.372
It could be a souvenir to you,
but it will be a trophy to me.

01:24:11.624 --> 01:24:13.416
This is only a beginning.

01:24:14.792 --> 01:24:20.332
These attorneys will
defend you at the court.

01:24:22.248 --> 01:24:23.708
I have some conditions.

01:24:24.956 --> 01:24:30.580
First, I'm not standing in
the court as a defendant.

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:36.080
The judge at the court is on
behalf of the Japanese emperor

01:24:36.748 --> 01:24:40.748
I'll stand in the court on
behalf of the Korean people.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:42.332
Therefore,

01:24:42.456 --> 01:24:48.123
They shall allow me to wear traditional
Korean clothes at the court.

01:24:48.124 --> 01:24:49.791
That's our man, right?

01:24:49.792 --> 01:24:56.664
Secondly, I stand in the court
to condemn Japanese invasion,

01:24:56.792 --> 01:25:01.579
<i>Allow me to read the declaration
to express my thoughts.</i>

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.223
- Will they pass these conditions?
- Park will make it happen.

01:25:04.248 --> 01:25:05.248
Here you go.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.208
<i>Thirdly, hire an interpreter, for
I will speak Korean at the trial.</i>

01:25:10.372 --> 01:25:11.916
This is all I got.

01:25:12.124 --> 01:25:13.124
<i>Finally,</i>

01:25:13.664 --> 01:25:18.792
<i>let me sit as high as the judge's seat.</i>

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:21.540
This is nonsense.

01:25:21.872 --> 01:25:25.208
If you don't accept this,
he'll refuse the trial.

01:25:26.416 --> 01:25:31.624
You don't want to see
a traitor refuse the trial.

01:25:31.956 --> 01:25:37.956
The defendant will sit as high as my seat?

01:25:39.416 --> 01:25:41.372
I don't mind losing my face,

01:25:41.708 --> 01:25:46.580
but save the face of
Japanese supreme court

01:25:49.248 --> 01:25:53.164
I'll talk to him to give up one condition.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.908
Make him give up two.

01:26:01.364 --> 01:26:05.492
I'll withdraw the condition
to speak in Korean,

01:26:05.824 --> 01:26:10.116
to lessen the confusion at the court.

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.780
That's one.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:21.240
Can you give up the
condition about the seat?

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.656
Why?

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:31.116
The judges are afraid that people
will make fun of the situation.

01:26:37.532 --> 01:26:44.447
Okay, but get me Korean traditional
uniform for the d-day.

01:26:44.448 --> 01:26:47.156
Don't worry. I'll get it for you

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.780
I'll do it.

01:26:51.492 --> 01:26:55.656
I'll wear Korean clothes, too.

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:04.492
One more thing.

01:27:05.364 --> 01:27:11.448
Ask them to accept our
marriage registration.

01:27:13.616 --> 01:27:15.492
Marriage registration?

01:27:18.364 --> 01:27:20.324
We'll receive a death sentence.

01:27:26.448 --> 01:27:27.532
So?

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:39.072
Bodies can be collected only by family.

01:27:40.492 --> 01:27:45.116
If you become my legal wife,

01:27:46.072 --> 01:27:52.824
my family will collect your body, too.

01:28:01.992 --> 01:28:03.072
Then...?

01:28:08.156 --> 01:28:12.324
We'll be buried together

01:28:13.572 --> 01:28:15.992
in my hometown in Korea.

01:28:22.408 --> 01:28:26.116
<i>I wanted to learn how to write.</i>

01:28:29.408 --> 01:28:35.408
<i>My parents never taught
me a single letter.</i>

01:28:36.864 --> 01:28:41.824
<i>My father didn't care, and
my mother was illiterate.</i>

01:28:45.448 --> 01:28:48.616
<i>In Korea, I was often
kicked out on the road.</i>

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.148
<i>Famished, I staggered on the street</i>

01:28:55.299 --> 01:28:57.923
<i>and found a chunk of burnt rice,</i>

01:28:57.948 --> 01:29:01.364
<i>which I hurriedly put into my mouth.</i>

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:05.839
<i>My grandma told me,</i>

01:29:05.864 --> 01:29:08.240
<i>"You're a nobody."</i>

01:29:08.824 --> 01:29:14.448
<i>You were born, but you never existed.</i>

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.947
<i>"That's why you can't go to school"</i>

01:29:17.948 --> 01:29:22.324
<i>I will survive. That's right.</i>

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:28.272
<i>I will take revenge against
those who make us suffer.</i>

01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:33.148
<i>That's right. I shall live.</i>

01:29:36.024 --> 01:29:39.148
<i>I will sacrifice my life to fight for them,</i>

01:29:39.648 --> 01:29:44.400
<i>for isolated people like us.</i>

01:29:44.856 --> 01:29:48.816
<i>February 26th, 1926
First trial</i>

01:29:49.856 --> 01:29:51.108
Line up.

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:55.856
This does look like a trial for treason.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:01.192
Yes, 200 police officers and
30 military police officers.

01:30:02.772 --> 01:30:04.356
Please read this.

01:30:24.192 --> 01:30:26.108
Fumiko!

01:30:27.148 --> 01:30:28.856
You look pretty, Fumiko

01:30:32.232 --> 01:30:36.064
I'm getting a strange
feeling about this trial.

01:30:36.816 --> 01:30:38.856
Tell me about it.

01:31:00.608 --> 01:31:02.815
This is going to be an
extraordinary trial.

01:31:02.816 --> 01:31:04.192
Right, right.

01:31:05.272 --> 01:31:08.147
I'm not at a wedding, am I?

01:31:08.148 --> 01:31:13.692
Are we watching a bride and
groom walking in or what?

01:31:13.772 --> 01:31:18.024
Let's celebrate! Sing along, guys!

01:31:22.732 --> 01:31:26.480
- Now we only need a pastor.
- I know!

01:31:30.564 --> 01:31:32.608
All rise.

01:31:40.108 --> 01:31:41.648
Be seated.

01:31:48.232 --> 01:31:52.023
What the hell are they wearing?

01:31:52.024 --> 01:31:53.564
Shut up!

01:31:55.148 --> 01:31:58.148
Silence!

01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.940
Silence!

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.737
Be quiet or we'll ask you to leave.

01:32:03.772 --> 01:32:04.900
Don't be scared.

01:32:05.148 --> 01:32:06.400
Watch me,

01:32:06.772 --> 01:32:10.400
I'll be the most rebellious
defendant in history.

01:32:13.024 --> 01:32:14.356
Name.

01:32:17.064 --> 01:32:18.692
My name is Park Yeol.

01:32:20.764 --> 01:32:23.392
Are you speaking in Korean?

01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:26.892
Yes, I am.

01:32:39.056 --> 01:32:40.432
Name.

01:32:40.764 --> 01:32:42.932
My name is Park Mun-ja.

01:32:44.724 --> 01:32:48.764
- How dare you speak Korean?
- Hang them right away!

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:52.016
They don't deserve a trial!

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:09.472
In order to keep the
public order at the court,

01:33:09.808 --> 01:33:12.680
We ask you to leave the gallery at once.

01:33:13.284 --> 01:33:15.808
Leave the courthouse!

01:33:34.432 --> 01:33:36.100
Sir, what does this say?

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:43.392
This is the number of Koreans massacred
during the big earthquake in Kanto.

01:33:43.848 --> 01:33:45.224
Is this true?

01:33:46.848 --> 01:33:50.599
Yes. The actual number may be even higher

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.724
if you include unconfirmed deaths.

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:05.016
I believe that Japanese
Empire will collapse.

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:09.216
Once the false image of a deified Emperor

01:34:09.556 --> 01:34:14.972
is revealed to its people that

01:34:15.556 --> 01:34:18.848
he, too, is only a human being.

01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:23.348
- Shut your mouth!
- You dirty Korean!

01:34:29.472 --> 01:34:34.056
But the Japanese people
do not try to realize that.

01:34:34.432 --> 01:34:37.640
The Empire of Japan will be maintained

01:34:38.264 --> 01:34:44.556
only until you force your people
to believe in Emperor's holiness.

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:53.056
You managed to distract your people

01:34:53.892 --> 01:34:56.600
whenever you faced a crisis.

01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.847
But the time is near for
the fall of the empire.

01:35:02.848 --> 01:35:05.432
You're insane!

01:35:06.556 --> 01:35:08.600
Judge!

01:35:09.472 --> 01:35:15.432
The very devils that destroy
our equal world are

01:35:15.764 --> 01:35:18.472
The Japanese Emperor and the Prince.

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:25.763
- They demand our sacrifice for the nation...
- You dirty bitch!

01:35:25.764 --> 01:35:27.679
You betrayed Japan.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.892
Shut The Fuck Up!

01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:44.031
The ruling class demands patriotism

01:35:44.056 --> 01:35:47.224
and loyalty for their interest.

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:52.991
Their brutal desire is maintained

01:35:53.016 --> 01:35:56.224
by sacrificing people's lives.

01:35:58.909 --> 01:36:00.471
Therefore,

01:36:00.472 --> 01:36:03.516
I warn those who blindly
accept such concepts

01:36:03.892 --> 01:36:09.472
that you will be enslaved unless
you enlighten yourselves.

01:36:14.556 --> 01:36:17.724
Is it a speech contest, or what!?

01:36:18.348 --> 01:36:22.180
Well, I have no right to stop their speech!

01:36:25.348 --> 01:36:28.056
Keep off foreign journalists.

01:36:28.725 --> 01:36:30.517
Mizuno put pressure.

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:33.579
The second trial will be closed.

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.132
Closed trial...

01:36:37.592 --> 01:36:40.008
You went overboard at the first trial.

01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:42.784
You can't wear the Korean robes anymore.

01:36:44.216 --> 01:36:49.716
Doesn't matter. That will make more news.

01:36:50.216 --> 01:36:54.840
The Great Kanto Earthquake was followed by

01:36:55.164 --> 01:36:58.540
the tragic massacre of
innocent Korean people

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:05.548
I can't help but doubt that
this case was manipulated

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.132
to cover up the massacre of Korean people.

01:37:10.592 --> 01:37:15.172
On behalf of the highest
authority in Japan,

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:21.880
Supreme Court must make its
position clear to the entire world.

01:37:22.216 --> 01:37:28.840
Not only for these two, but to
save Japan from such doubts,

01:37:30.124 --> 01:37:34.372
I demand an answer.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.092
Answer from whom?

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:44.132
On behalf of Japan,
I ask you to answer it.

01:37:46.924 --> 01:37:48.672
Why should I?

01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:53.632
The emperor can't be summoned
as the witness, can he?

01:37:55.592 --> 01:38:00.132
Will you summon him, if I ask?

01:38:03.092 --> 01:38:04.756
Recess!

01:38:16.565 --> 01:38:17.924
Are you looking for...

01:38:18.924 --> 01:38:20.800
...this?

01:38:21.256 --> 01:38:23.964
How dare you read it
without my permission?

01:38:24.172 --> 01:38:26.756
Now I understand

01:38:27.048 --> 01:38:29.172
what made you different from us.

01:38:29.924 --> 01:38:31.839
Now you know how enlightened I am.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.672
I'm not a fool like you.

01:38:38.256 --> 01:38:41.440
I corrected some misspelling.

01:38:50.256 --> 01:38:53.464
Among the many emotions
held by Korean people

01:38:53.592 --> 01:38:58.756
their antipathy towards Japan
is deeply rooted in their hearts.

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:07.008
- What made me who I am now -

01:39:11.632 --> 01:39:18.256
In 1919, March 1st, I witnessed
Korean Independence Movement.

01:39:19.092 --> 01:39:24.592
On that day, I felt a strong
feeling of empathy to Koreans

01:39:25.672 --> 01:39:29.548
and a strong will to rebel against power

01:39:30.424 --> 01:39:32.340
erupted inside me.

01:39:34.622 --> 01:39:35.622
On that day,

01:39:36.832 --> 01:39:40.708
Japanese government cut off our tongues,

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.332
burned our people,

01:39:42.708 --> 01:39:46.956
and stabbed women's
genitals with steel skewers

01:39:47.872 --> 01:39:51.916
and they threatened us
never to mention about.

01:39:52.956 --> 01:39:55.624
March 1st Movement.

01:39:57.792 --> 01:40:05.332
I remember the massacre after
the earthquake in Kanto.

01:40:06.124 --> 01:40:09.372
Koreans were killed with
bamboo spears and swords,

01:40:09.832 --> 01:40:14.624
They were tied and thrown alive

01:40:15.208 --> 01:40:17.792
into the rivers and fire.

01:40:18.124 --> 01:40:27.540
They were tied to bikes and
dragged until they died.

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:34.456
And you're trying to conceal
the Korean massacre,

01:40:34.832 --> 01:40:39.164
just like March 1st Movement.

01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:42.000
However,

01:40:43.792 --> 01:40:45.832
I will not let that happen.

01:40:46.664 --> 01:40:49.372
The more you try to conceal it,

01:40:49.708 --> 01:40:53.956
the more it'll unveil to the world,

01:40:54.456 --> 01:40:56.248
and to the history.

01:40:58.748 --> 01:41:02.708
You call your country a civilized nation.

01:41:03.416 --> 01:41:07.500
Then conduct an investigation,

01:41:07.832 --> 01:41:11.000
gather witnesses' testimonies

01:41:11.748 --> 01:41:13.975
and dig out the bodies
of innocent Koreans.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.792
Get confessions from
the soldiers and vigilantes.

01:41:20.332 --> 01:41:26.580
If you still can't find the
truth, yes, I'm a lunatic.

01:41:27.416 --> 01:41:31.000
If you still can't find the truth,

01:41:31.378 --> 01:41:33.347
I'll convert to Japanese Imperialism

01:41:33.372 --> 01:41:37.792
and be a citizen under
your sacred Emperor!

01:41:43.758 --> 01:41:46.594
To protect your emperor,

01:41:46.956 --> 01:41:52.124
over 6,000 of us were
killed without a reason.

01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:55.124
Any objection?

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:57.372
Get that traitor!

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.080
Please calm down.

01:42:03.664 --> 01:42:06.080
His statement is not true.

01:42:07.208 --> 01:42:10.080
Yes.

01:42:11.956 --> 01:42:16.872
We can't simply believe
such traitor's words...

01:42:17.872 --> 01:42:21.832
This is Mizuno speaking.
Please tell the emperor,

01:42:22.164 --> 01:42:28.080
the cabinet will organize
an investigation committee.

01:42:28.416 --> 01:42:32.540
Tell him not to worry.

01:42:32.872 --> 01:42:34.456
Thank you.

01:42:34.872 --> 01:42:36.872
What investigation committee?

01:42:37.075 --> 01:42:38.535
Yes.

01:42:38.864 --> 01:42:41.532
Japan is a civilized country
with law and order.

01:42:41.864 --> 01:42:45.948
But the committee will be
dissolved after the time limit.

01:42:46.864 --> 01:42:50.572
If we don't give enough time,
there will be fierce criticism.

01:42:51.156 --> 01:42:52.908
I can tell you for sure.

01:42:53.948 --> 01:42:57.700
In a month, they'll want to stop.

01:42:58.156 --> 01:43:01.363
What if they find evidence
within that period?

01:43:01.364 --> 01:43:05.740
The military participated
in the massacre too.

01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:09.780
Holding the military responsible?

01:43:11.864 --> 01:43:14.864
That means blaming his majesty the King!

01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:18.532
So before things get uglier,

01:43:18.824 --> 01:43:24.032
you should end the trial.

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:28.072
That's why we should throw
Park onto the guillotine

01:43:28.408 --> 01:43:32.026
before the lunatic drives us all insane!!

01:43:34.116 --> 01:43:37.448
You have visitors.

01:43:38.356 --> 01:43:44.064
Novelist Nakanishi and Satomura.

01:43:44.948 --> 01:43:51.740
He was once jailed in Korea for
criticizing the Governor-general.

01:43:52.572 --> 01:43:54.156
How have you been?

01:43:54.492 --> 01:43:56.156
You know each other?

01:43:57.324 --> 01:44:06.364
We fought together against
the abuse of Korean miners.

01:44:07.364 --> 01:44:11.408
On behalf of Japan, I came
to deliver apologies.

01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:19.408
I promise I will make
Japan pay for its faults.

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:28.608
Please don't forget that
many of us admire you.

01:44:29.356 --> 01:44:35.940
Never give up on conscience
of Japanese people.

01:44:37.692 --> 01:44:41.940
We're Korean students.

01:44:42.232 --> 01:44:45.608
We'll follow your footsteps.

01:44:46.356 --> 01:44:47.524
Thank you.

01:44:48.608 --> 01:44:53.316
I can't run them on papers
anyway, let me get inside, now.

01:44:53.856 --> 01:44:54.804
You sons of bitches!

01:44:54.829 --> 01:44:58.316
<i>March 25th, 1926
The final trial</i>

01:45:00.692 --> 01:45:02.772
All rise.

01:45:12.108 --> 01:45:13.272
What?

01:45:15.232 --> 01:45:16.400
Be seated.

01:45:19.024 --> 01:45:22.692
Prosecutor, please deliver
the closing argument.

01:45:23.692 --> 01:45:27.816
Defendant Park Yeol.

01:45:28.856 --> 01:45:36.440
Having a deprived childhood, he
gradually developed a grudge.

01:45:36.772 --> 01:45:38.232
<i>We'll never forget!</i>

01:45:38.564 --> 01:45:42.608
<i>We'll reveal the truth!</i>

01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:48.192
We will never forget!

01:45:48.772 --> 01:45:50.692
<i>We'll never forget!</i>

01:45:52.564 --> 01:45:54.940
<i>We'll reveal the truth!</i>

01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:04.148
He became obsessed with narrow
political and social views.

01:46:06.232 --> 01:46:08.063
Kaneko Fumiko had tragic childhood

01:46:08.064 --> 01:46:12.856
and her parents abandoned her.

01:46:13.232 --> 01:46:16.856
She denied power and authority...

01:46:17.356 --> 01:46:19.108
<i>We'll never forget!</i>

01:46:21.732 --> 01:46:23.816
<i>We'll reveal the truth!</i>

01:46:27.863 --> 01:46:34.071
According to Article 238,
the two are found jointly guilty.

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.608
Henceforth, they will be prosecuted
according to the sentencing.

01:46:42.608 --> 01:46:45.148
Defendants, any last word?

01:46:45.816 --> 01:46:49.272
No. Good job.

01:46:53.772 --> 01:46:57.900
Kaneko Fumiko, any last word?

01:47:04.116 --> 01:47:11.908
I know Park's true nature.

01:47:13.692 --> 01:47:16.108
And I love him the way he is.

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:23.692
Despite all his shortcomings,
I embrace every single part of it.

01:47:25.316 --> 01:47:29.192
I truly love him as he is.

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:38.148
This is my request to the court.

01:47:41.192 --> 01:47:45.940
Throw us onto the guillotine together.

01:47:47.064 --> 01:47:51.856
I'll be happy as long as I die with him.

01:47:52.385 --> 01:47:54.925
Shut up! Close the trial!

01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.064
Lastly,

01:48:01.772 --> 01:48:03.524
my last word to Park.

01:48:05.856 --> 01:48:11.772
Even if the sentence separates us,

01:48:14.732 --> 01:48:16.108
I will

01:48:20.732 --> 01:48:22.108
never

01:48:24.148 --> 01:48:31.480
leave you to die alone.

01:48:45.732 --> 01:48:49.564
For treason in Article
73 of the Criminal Act

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:54.692
and for violating the
explosives regulation,

01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:59.524
I hereby announce the sentence.

01:49:00.613 --> 01:49:04.781
Park Yeol and Kaneko Fumiko

01:49:05.221 --> 01:49:07.345
are sentenced to death.

01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:14.564
Hey, Judge.

01:49:16.272 --> 01:49:17.732
Hey, Judge!

01:49:20.732 --> 01:49:24.192
You can do whatever you want with my body,

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:28.480
but you can do nothing to my spirit.

01:49:28.816 --> 01:49:30.480
Hurray!

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:34.856
Hurray!

01:49:35.564 --> 01:49:37.524
Hurray!

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.439
<i>Traitors Sentenced to Death.</i>

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.772
"Fumiko sadly lowered her head?"

01:49:54.064 --> 01:49:56.979
What's wrong with these articles?
This isn't true at all.

01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:01.064
<i>Park cursed and swore at the judge?</i>

01:50:02.816 --> 01:50:06.939
When did he curse at the judge?
This is insane.

01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:08.524
Sons of bitches.

01:50:09.651 --> 01:50:11.993
There's an article on a Korean Daily.

01:50:18.848 --> 01:50:22.079
Only Korean Daily told truth
about the hurraying.

01:50:22.104 --> 01:50:24.056
<i>Screams Hurray after
Hearing the Death Sentence.</i>

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:32.391
The parliament is against
the death sentence.

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:35.556
We held trials to cover up the massacre,

01:50:35.892 --> 01:50:41.100
and we finally sentenced them to death.

01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:45.640
If the imperial family
reduces the sentence now,

01:50:46.056 --> 01:50:53.224
that will make this trial
look like that rebel's circus.

01:50:54.056 --> 01:50:57.100
What do you think,
Governor-general of Korea?

01:50:58.224 --> 01:51:02.931
We suppressed the March 1st
Movement with great difficulty

01:51:02.932 --> 01:51:11.056
I'm afraid what will happen
in Korea when we execute him.

01:51:11.392 --> 01:51:15.892
Koreans are all fixing
their eyes on this trial.

01:51:16.308 --> 01:51:17.808
In that case,

01:51:17.972 --> 01:51:22.224
we have to make a political choice.

01:51:42.392 --> 01:51:47.180
Emperor reduced your sentence

01:51:48.764 --> 01:51:50.224

The supreme court's death
sentence was fair enough,

01:52:26.892 --> 01:52:38.516
Nevertheless, the imperial
family decided to show mercy.

01:52:38.724 --> 01:52:45.680
Accordingly, the death penalty
is reduced to life imprisonment.

with Deep Gratitude</i>

01:52:59.812 --> 01:53:03.489
You'll be transported
to the prison in Chiba.

01:53:06.749 --> 01:53:08.209
How about Fumiko?

01:53:08.556 --> 01:53:11.016
She'll be transported to Utsunomiya.

01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:14.516
A distant place from Chiba.

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.764
Please take care of these.

01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:34.472
Keep the sentences simple and candid.

01:53:34.909 --> 01:53:37.865
Don't worry too much about the grammar.

01:53:39.035 --> 01:53:42.743
I don't want poetic phrases
or fancy adjectives.

01:53:46.056 --> 01:53:47.348
Okay.

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:52.892
I promise you I will publish them.

01:54:01.196 --> 01:54:03.072
Pass my love to the members.

01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:26.848
<i>Family Register</i>

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:33.556
Head of family, Park Yeol.

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.932
<i>Chiba Prison</i>

01:55:17.142 --> 01:55:23.348
<i>To Live doesn't merely mean To Move.</i>

01:55:25.467 --> 01:55:28.343
<i>If I can move upon my will,</i>

01:55:31.716 --> 01:55:37.800
<i>even if the move itself
eventually leads to Death,</i>

01:55:39.964 --> 01:55:44.592
<i>It is not the denial of Life.</i>

01:55:45.548 --> 01:55:47.800
<i>It is an Affirmation.</i>

01:55:50.592 --> 01:55:54.340
<i>Only the last 3 years of my life with Park</i>

01:55:55.048 --> 01:56:00.800
<i>was the true life of my own.</i>

01:56:06.172 --> 01:56:08.340
Still on a hunger strike?

01:56:11.632 --> 01:56:17.216
Now I can see the door to the end.

01:56:19.048 --> 01:56:22.300
Please survive.

01:56:25.672 --> 01:56:28.380
How's Fumiko doing?

01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:33.300
You must survive.

01:56:38.092 --> 01:56:44.132
She promised to die with me.

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:51.132
She said she'd not let me go alone.

01:56:54.228 --> 01:56:56.144
How's Fumiko?

01:57:05.216 --> 01:57:09.592
Tell me. How's she doing?

01:57:14.351 --> 01:57:15.643
She's dead.

01:57:21.364 --> 01:57:22.988
Suicide?

01:57:24.091 --> 01:57:29.219
They won't tell me the cause of her
death, or let me collect her body.

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:37.256
I couldn't even talk with
the medical examiner.

01:57:41.508 --> 01:57:45.632
You must survive.

01:57:47.644 --> 01:57:49.312
Please bury her

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:54.756
in my hometown.

01:58:18.713 --> 01:58:25.213
Maybe they killed her
and faked it as suicide.

01:58:26.916 --> 01:58:31.956
She could've killed herself

01:58:33.938 --> 01:58:36.314
to show her resistance against power.

01:58:37.208 --> 01:58:40.664
She must be cold.

01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:53.624
She wrote 1,000 pages
for her autobiography.

01:58:53.832 --> 01:58:57.916
It's nonsense she killed
herself without a note.

01:59:17.124 --> 01:59:20.332
<i>The Asahi Daily</i>

01:59:20.748 --> 01:59:22.787
- You're a journalist, right?
- Yes.

01:59:22.872 --> 01:59:24.500
Have you seen this?

01:59:30.803 --> 01:59:33.931
The Prosecutor let them
use an interrogation room

01:59:33.956 --> 01:59:36.956
and allowed them to take
a picture like this?

01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:40.499
Rumors say Fumiko was murdered.

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.146
She had a sign of strangulation.

01:59:43.506 --> 01:59:44.747
Murder?

01:59:44.748 --> 01:59:47.371
If she had been pregnant,

01:59:47.372 --> 01:59:48.956
they can't let her live.

01:59:49.332 --> 01:59:52.208
They can't let her
give birth in the cell...

01:59:52.992 --> 01:59:57.532
She had a sign of strangulation.
Any evidence for murder?

01:59:57.557 --> 02:00:00.557
Evidence can be manipulated after death.

02:00:00.864 --> 02:00:04.780
This photo was sent to all
the publishing companies.

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:08.464
Shouldn't we print this first?

02:00:21.656 --> 02:00:24.572
Did you plan this too?

02:00:28.908 --> 02:00:31.280
What are you talking about?

02:00:32.032 --> 02:00:37.116
I couldn't even get a bomb and throw it

02:00:37.448 --> 02:00:40.324
I should do something bigger.

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:47.908
Keep mocking, but that
won't destroy Japan.

02:00:49.116 --> 02:00:54.032
Keep concealing, but that
won't hide the truth.

02:00:54.616 --> 02:01:01.324
Because you keep digging,
we're becoming more thorough.

02:01:04.408 --> 02:01:08.864
Right, you're thoroughly
making fabulous errors,

02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:15.032
one error after another, and another...

02:01:17.072 --> 02:01:19.240
Will you be able to handle them?

02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:33.032
Do you know why we reduced your sentence?

02:01:35.448 --> 02:01:40.656
To make you be forgotten
and be worthlessly alive.

02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:48.572
To make you live forever in prison.

02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:53.616
Live long, as long as possible,

02:01:55.072 --> 02:01:58.240
and finally make yourself famous for that!

02:02:04.324 --> 02:02:06.156
Of course I will!

02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:09.156
I'll live as long as I can,

02:02:09.492 --> 02:02:15.364
to reveal every single
thing you did to us!

02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:40.408
This could be our last photo.

02:02:40.864 --> 02:02:43.448
Shouldn't we make this special?

02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.324
Last photo?

02:02:54.864 --> 02:02:57.032
It shouldn't be ordinary.

02:02:57.419 --> 02:02:58.755
Of course, not.

02:02:58.780 --> 02:03:00.656
This picture will show them

02:03:00.908 --> 02:03:03.572
who we truly are.

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:15.031
<i>Park served 22 years and 2 months and
was released after Korean Independence.</i>

02:04:15.032 --> 02:04:18.991
<i>In 1946, he excavated the remains of those
who fought for Korean Independence,</i>

02:04:18.992 --> 02:04:21.655
<i>and buried them in Seoul.</i>

02:04:21.656 --> 02:04:30.032
<i>In 1989, Park was posthumously
honored a Presidential Medal.</i>

02:04:30.948 --> 02:04:34.907
<i>Kaneko Fumiko was buried in Korea
in 1931 as Park had wished.</i>

02:04:34.908 --> 02:04:38.699
<i>Kazuo published Fumiko's autobiography.</i>

02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:42.390
<i>Huse, who defended Park
and Fumiko was the first.</i>
