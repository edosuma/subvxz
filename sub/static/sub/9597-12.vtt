Cavanaugh brought us all in early.

01:00.083 --> 01:02.256
Me too. 
Can't be good news, right?

01:02.290 --> 01:04.730
Maybe Angelina Jolie is
playing a homicide cop

Yeah, that must be it.

01:07.912 --> 01:10.525
No coffee? What the hell?

01:10.559 --> 01:12.761
- What?
- Try some green tea.

01:12.796 --> 01:17.002
- Only 15 milligrams of caffeine.
- Anybody want fresh mint for their tea?

01:17.037 --> 01:20.313
- How nice. Thank you.
- No. We want caffeine.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.118
I'm not allowed to serve coffee today.

01:22.152 --> 01:24.797
- Said who?
- Morning.

01:24.832 --> 01:26.133
Him.

01:26.168 --> 01:28.872
Cavanaugh: I'm sure you're all
wondering why I asked you in early today.

01:28.906 --> 01:31.346
Actually, we were wondering
where the coffee is, sir.

01:31.380 --> 01:34.019
I'm glad you asked ...
'cause the homicide squad

01:34.054 --> 01:37.098

- Dr. Isles?

I'm happy to do whatever I
can to support this program.

01:42.275 --> 01:44.077
- Swell.
- And why is that?

01:44.112 --> 01:47.856
Is it because 70% of all medical
costs are related to smoking,

01:47.890 --> 01:51.400
physical inactivity, poor
food choices, and stress?

01:51.434 --> 01:54.239
Well, yes, which leads
to higher-than-average

01:54.240 --> 01:57.044
mortality rates for cancer,
suicide, and heart disease.

01:57.078 --> 01:59.016
Maybe because somebody
took their coffee away.

- Cavanaugh: She's right.

in physical-activity breaks.

02:40.343 --> 02:44.018
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?
I could have stopped at Boston Joe's!

02:44.052 --> 02:47.524
Oh, this aggressive behavior
proves you're a caffeine addict.

02:47.559 --> 02:49.194
Well, let's just take
a moment and celebrate the fact

02:49.228 --> 02:51.467
Lieutenant Cavanaugh
wants us to be Captains.

02:51.501 --> 02:53.506
He wants us to be hall monitors, Maura.

He killed my girlfriend, Katrina.

Right. The prep-school

03:18.087 --> 03:20.526

Quentin Morris lost his
last bid for a new trial.

03:22.629 --> 03:24.431
His final appeal was denied yesterday.

Really? It wasn't my case.
I hadn't been following it.

03:28.370 --> 03:31.305
At least Quentin Morris will
pay for what he did to her.

03:31.340 --> 03:34.378
I'm sorry. 
We're late for a crime scene.

03:34.413 --> 03:38.483
- Of course. But, please, take this.
- I can't accept anything.

03:38.517 --> 03:42.286
It's made out to the police

Quentin Morris would
get one more shot at it.

04:03.884 --> 04:06.753
- Why? You think he was innocent?
- Well, there was a lot of evidence

04:06.788 --> 04:08.491

to the rape and murder

Do you see hints of Dickens, too?

- Victim was a steampunker.
- A who?

04:44.228 --> 04:49.502

- You find a suicide note?
- Yeah.

The note was in the typewriter.

So, what's in the new manuscript?

05:21.963 --> 05:26.199
Wasn't here. Slater wrote his
books on this manual typewriter.

It's not an easy knot to tie.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.999
The ligature marks on his neck
are inconsistent with a suicide.

Are they consistent with a homicide?

Hmm.

Okay, I'll make it easy for you.

Glad to hear you're leading
everyone, Captain Rizzoli.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.144
Yes. Yes, sir.

11:57.145 --> 11:59.328
Yes. Everybody up!

11:59.362 --> 12:02.764
Stand up. On ...
on your feet!

12:02.799 --> 12:05.801
Because... we are...
jogging!

12:05.836 --> 12:09.205
We are jogging in place.
Doesn't that feel good?

12:09.240 --> 12:10.440
Detective Rizzoli?

12:10.474 --> 12:12.142
We are jogging.
Yes. Isn't ...

12:12.176 --> 12:14.043
- Janie!
- What? God.

12:14.078 --> 12:15.312
Brought in your suspect.

12:15.346 --> 12:17.815
When you've finished
with your calisthenics,

12:17.849 --> 12:19.284
maybe you want to talk to her.

12:19.319 --> 12:23.326
Thank you.
Oh, stop!

12:23.361 --> 12:27.461
I'm telling you, I don't
know where the manuscript is.

12:27.495 --> 12:29.929
You came to Boston to
get it, though, right?

12:29.964 --> 12:31.799
Ethan called me two days ago.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.405
Said that if I didn't
show up, he would burn it.

12:34.439 --> 12:36.309
Sounds like he was angry with you.

12:36.344 --> 12:39.478
It was mutual.
He was three months past his deadline.

12:39.512 --> 12:41.445
Were you romantically
involved with Ethan Slater?

12:41.480 --> 12:43.746
Not really.

12:44.347 --> 12:50.960
- "Not really"?
- Look, it was never... anything.

12:50.994 --> 12:52.495
We think you came to Boston

12:52.530 --> 12:54.831
to make sure that Ethan
didn't burn that manuscript.

12:54.866 --> 12:56.267
And then when he
wouldn't give it to you,

12:56.301 --> 12:58.203
you staged his murder
to look like a suicide.

12:58.239 --> 13:01.177
Suicide Boy finally does it.
Bet that would be good for sales.

13:01.211 --> 13:03.751
You're wrong.
I flew up early this morning,

13:03.785 --> 13:06.788
and I went straight to his apartment.

13:06.822 --> 13:09.392
He was dead when I got there.

13:09.427 --> 13:12.297
That's funny ...  your name
isn't on any flight manifest.

13:12.331 --> 13:14.132
I flew up on a private jet.

13:14.167 --> 13:18.997
- We'll need that tail number.
- Of course.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.105
Ethan was a brilliant writer.

13:24.140 --> 13:28.112
I really hope that his
manuscript wasn't lost.

13:28.146 --> 13:29.547
The tail number, Ms. Randall.

13:36.985 --> 13:38.119
[ knock on door ]

13:39.990 --> 13:44.227
- Detective Frost. Come in.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

13:44.261 --> 13:46.161
Would you like to join
me in a meditation?

13:47.866 --> 13:50.973
Actually, I was wondering
if you could take a look

13:51.007 --> 13:54.513
- at an old autopsy report.
- The prep-school murder.

13:54.547 --> 13:57.550
Jane mentioned that you
were concerned about it.

14:00.524 --> 14:04.096
Quentin Morris' DNA was found on the
murder victim, Katrina Livingston.

14:04.131 --> 14:06.233
An eyewitness testified
that he left her dorm room

14:06.267 --> 14:09.135
around the time she
was raped and murdered.

14:09.169 --> 14:11.339
You'd like me to review the autopsy?

14:11.373 --> 14:12.874
Yeah.

14:12.909 --> 14:14.945
I don't know why I'm
worrying about this now.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.449
Do you identify with Quentin?

14:17.484 --> 14:22.286
I was one of three black kids
at an elite, all-white prep school.

14:22.321 --> 14:25.022
I just keep thinking
that with so much evidence

14:25.057 --> 14:27.090
against one kid who didn't belong,

14:27.125 --> 14:29.792
maybe they didn't look any further.

14:30.927 --> 14:32.893
I'll look through this.

14:32.928 --> 14:35.928
Would you look at my
interrogation of Quentin, too?

14:35.963 --> 14:39.601
- What am I looking for?
- Something I'm not seeing.

14:42.505 --> 14:44.605
I haven't thought of
this case in two years.

14:44.639 --> 14:48.908
- Why am I sweating it now?
- It doesn't matter why, Frost.

14:48.942 --> 14:50.977
If there's something to find,
you and Maura need to find it.

14:51.011 --> 14:54.515
Could be nothing, but...
my gut's been jumping all day.

14:54.550 --> 14:56.616
Yeah. Mine, too.

14:56.650 --> 15:00.518
Maybe it's because of these
dried beefs. [ chuckles ]

15:00.553 --> 15:02.253
Yuck. Ugh. 
Have you tried this stuff?

15:02.287 --> 15:07.496
- It tastes like sweat and rotten celery.
- Stop drinking it.

15:07.530 --> 15:10.230
[ snickers ] And stop
drinking your own sweat, too.

15:10.264 --> 15:12.197
Jane?

15:12.232 --> 15:16.401
- Something's going on with Ma.
- Maybe she ate too many chia seeds.

15:16.435 --> 15:20.369
- Jane, she's growing herbs.
- Uh-oh.

15:20.404 --> 15:23.671
Did you spot cannabis between
the Basil and the Rosemary?

15:23.706 --> 15:25.305
She hasn't gardened since pop left.

15:25.340 --> 15:28.275
Oh, no. I hope she's not
enjoying her life again.

15:28.309 --> 15:30.580
Okay, she's suddenly
interested in lip balm,

15:30.614 --> 15:34.150
and she asked me if the pants
she was wearing made her look fat.

15:34.185 --> 15:36.983
That is bad. 
No, that's a bad sign.

15:37.017 --> 15:38.949
I told you.

15:40.150 --> 15:42.519
You can stop pretending
like you're working, Korsak.

15:42.553 --> 15:46.592
- You're screwing around with the book.
- Oh, yeah? Listen to this.

15:46.627 --> 15:48.525
"I met Sadie in a suicide chat room."

15:48.560 --> 15:50.691
What the hell is wrong
with kids these days?

15:50.725 --> 15:52.961
I'm waiting to hear the "working" part.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.166
"Sadie was into steampunk
and suicide, too.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.069
"We made a pact to end our lives.

15:58.103 --> 16:01.305
We said goodbye in the chat
room that brought us together."

16:01.339 --> 16:04.307
Slater tried to kill himself
as part of a suicide pact?

16:04.341 --> 16:06.975
Yeah. And according to his
book, Sadie was successful.

16:07.009 --> 16:11.779
Well, maybe somebody close to Sadie
blames "Suicide Boy" for her death.

16:22.572 --> 16:24.840
No record of any "Sadie"
committing suicide in Boston 

16:24.874 --> 16:26.174
in the last two years.

16:26.209 --> 16:28.043
Maybe Slater made her
up for dramatic effect.

16:28.077 --> 16:30.847
Yeah, like that guy on "Oprah"
that wrote that fake memoir.

16:32.151 --> 16:36.392
- "Oprah"?
- What, I can't have a sensitive side?

16:36.426 --> 16:39.162
Maybe Slater changed Sadie's
name so he wouldn't get sued.

16:39.196 --> 16:40.330
Oh, he did.

16:41.432 --> 16:44.337
"Names have been changed to
protect the not-so-innocent."

16:44.371 --> 16:47.479
Frost, look up Slater's 911 call for
his attempted suicide two years ago.

16:47.513 --> 16:49.049
See if it's still in the system.

16:51.119 --> 16:53.487
[ beeping ] 
Found it. February 12, 2010.

16:53.521 --> 16:56.024
<i>Dispatcher: 911. What's your emergency?</i>

16:56.059 --> 16:58.997
<i>Slater: I need an ambulance.
I slit my wrists. I'm bleeding!</i>

16:59.032 --> 17:00.300
Any other suicide calls that day?

17:03.274 --> 17:06.577
<i>Well, someone reported a
suicide ...  Kevin Baker.</i>

17:06.611 --> 17:09.578
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

17:09.613 --> 17:13.079
<i>Kevin: I'm at 5392 Stone Avenue.
Oh, my god!</i>

17:13.115 --> 17:16.049
<i>My sister ...  she ...
she slit her wrists.</i>

17:16.083 --> 17:18.354
<i>Tamara!
Oh, my god.</i>

17:18.387 --> 17:19.992
Korsak: Here's the police report.

17:20.026 --> 17:21.393
Tamara Baker, 19. 
Her brother found her body.

17:21.428 --> 17:25.499
She was a steampunker.
Maybe Tamara Baker was Sadie.

17:25.532 --> 17:28.334
Running Kevin Baker's name.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.905
Whoa.
Check out her brother's website.

17:31.939 --> 17:35.612
Jane: I'm thinking maybe her
brother Kevin blamed Ethan Slater.

17:35.647 --> 17:38.950
- Looks like Kevin holds a grudge.
- Frost, click on that video link.

17:39.484 --> 17:42.220
<i>Suicide is not something you ...</i>

17:42.254 --> 17:44.490
<i>you write about and make money off of.</i>

17:44.524 --> 17:47.360
<i>This sick, punk coward
took my sister from me.</i>

17:47.395 --> 17:50.531
<i>Here's what I think about
him and this piece of trash.</i>

17:50.565 --> 17:52.566
<i>I hope he burns just like it.</i>

17:54.603 --> 17:56.237
Only 40 views.

17:56.271 --> 17:58.973
Kevin didn't find much
of a sympathetic audience.

17:59.007 --> 18:00.308
[ cellphone vibrates ]
Jane: Must have pissed him off even more

18:00.342 --> 18:04.645
when "Suicide Boy" sold five
million copies. Let's bring him in.

18:05.581 --> 18:07.148
What? Maura's got something?

18:07.182 --> 18:11.387
- It can wait.
- Frost, go. We got this.

18:13.424 --> 18:16.458
<i>Frost: State police are
on their way, Quentin.</i>

18:16.491 --> 18:18.226
<i>You're looking at murder.</i>

18:18.260 --> 18:21.164
<i>Quentin: Murder?
Look, this is crazy, okay?</i>

18:21.198 --> 18:23.033
<i>I did not murder Katrina.</i>

18:23.067 --> 18:24.570
<i>Now, I don't know what
they're saying they found,</i>

18:24.604 --> 18:27.042
<i>and I get why Sudbury
academy thinks it's me,</i>

18:27.076 --> 18:28.510
<i>But I didn't do this!</i>

18:28.545 --> 18:30.513
Both of Quentin's upper
eyelids droop slightly,

18:30.547 --> 18:34.217
his eyes lose focus,
the corners of his lips pull down.

18:34.251 --> 18:36.252
Okay, so, what does that mean?

18:36.286 --> 18:39.090
Quentin's micro-expressions
indicate that he was under great duress.

18:39.124 --> 18:41.759
He was about to be 
charged with murder.

18:43.227 --> 18:48.765
It's not fear projected on his face.
That's anguish. Grief.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.072
<i>There's something you're
not telling me, Quentin.</i>

18:52.107 --> 18:57.313
<i>You got to believe me, detective,
 okay? I didn't do this.</i>

18:57.347 --> 18:59.716
<i>Then give me something
I can work with, Quentin.</i>

19:02.222 --> 19:04.492
<i>Me and Katrina were together.</i>

19:04.528 --> 19:07.467
<i>Okay, nobody knew but her homegirl Ann.</i>

19:07.501 --> 19:10.136
<i>All right, just ask Ann. Please.</i>

19:10.171 --> 19:11.204
Who is Ann?

19:11.239 --> 19:15.345
Katrina Livingston's best friend.
She lived across the hall.

19:15.379 --> 19:16.816
She was the Commonwealth's 
star witness.

19:16.850 --> 19:19.488
<i>Is the person you saw
exiting the victim's room</i>

19:19.524 --> 19:21.625
<i>in the courtroom?</i>

19:21.659 --> 19:25.394
<i>[ voice breaking ] 
Yes. That's him.</i>

19:25.429 --> 19:27.097
<i>Let the record show</i>

19:27.132 --> 19:29.135
<i>that the witness has
identified the defendant.</i>

19:29.169 --> 19:31.273
<i>Did Katrina ever tell you
 that she had</i>

19:31.307 --> 19:35.346
<i>an intimate relationship
with the defendant?</i>

19:35.380 --> 19:38.348
<i>She was going out with Bradley.</i>

19:38.383 --> 19:41.484
<i>And Quentin took her from Bradley,
from all of us.</i>

19:41.519 --> 19:45.659
She doesn't answer her question.

19:45.694 --> 19:48.261
You're right ... she dodges it.

19:48.295 --> 19:50.598
Her face also exhibits hot spots.

19:50.633 --> 19:53.571
She's attempting to
convey anger and disgust,

19:53.605 --> 19:55.876
but her raised, 
drawn-together eyebrows indicate 

19:55.910 --> 19:58.113
that she's masking deep fear.

19:58.147 --> 19:59.748
Quentin begged me to talk to Ann.

19:59.782 --> 20:04.487
She was probably terrified
by the time the state police got to her.

20:04.521 --> 20:08.426
Well, it wasn't your case, Frost.
It still isn't.

20:08.461 --> 20:11.031
What do I do, Dr. Isles?

20:14.805 --> 20:21.183
Pursue the truth.
Ann has more to say.

20:24.986 --> 20:27.222
I'm sorry about your sister's suicide.

20:27.256 --> 20:30.627
It wasn't a suicide.
Tamara was murdered.

20:30.661 --> 20:31.928
Korsak: The police report
says she slit her wrists.

20:31.963 --> 20:34.328
Are you saying she didn't do that?

20:34.363 --> 20:37.330
I'm saying Ethan Slater got in her head
and talked her into killing herself.

20:37.365 --> 20:40.501
She's bleeding out, he's
calling for help. That's murder.

20:40.535 --> 20:42.504
She dies. He lives and makes
a fortune writing about her.

20:42.538 --> 20:44.774
Jane: So you took justice
into your own hands.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.839
Your sister killed herself,
you killed Ethan Slater.

20:46.873 --> 20:50.175
No, I wish.

20:50.210 --> 20:53.513
I've fantasized about killing
that bastard a million times.

20:53.547 --> 20:56.449
Slashing that punk across his
stupid face ... I dream about it.

20:56.484 --> 20:58.317
Sounds pretty real to me, Kevin.

20:58.352 --> 21:02.786
I wish it had been me.
I wouldn't have let him go so easy.

21:02.820 --> 21:06.226
But I didn't do it.
 I got an alibi.

21:06.260 --> 21:08.497
Yeah? 
Where were you last night?

21:08.532 --> 21:11.532
30 stories in the air.
I'm a crane operator.

21:11.566 --> 21:15.766
I work the graveyard shift.
You can check it out.

21:23.579 --> 21:27.951
- Close your eyes.
- How much longer?

21:27.985 --> 21:29.854
[ sighs ] 
You're insufferable.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.756
[ mockingly ] 
Are we there yet?

21:31.791 --> 21:34.989
[ normal voice ] Just quiet
the chatter in the monkey mind.

21:35.023 --> 21:37.855
Inhale deeply through your nose.

21:37.889 --> 21:41.661
Exhale.
[ sighs ]

21:41.695 --> 21:43.764
<i>[ thud ]</i>

21:43.798 --> 21:46.801
- Did you hear that?
- Try not to attach to the ambient noise.

21:46.836 --> 21:50.570
No, it sounded like it was coming
from right outside the guest house.

21:50.604 --> 21:53.975
<i>Angela: Maura! Maura!</i>

21:55.378 --> 21:58.882
- Ma, what the hell's going on?
- He fell. Hurry, please!

22:00.418 --> 22:03.884
- Uh, no!
- Ma!

22:03.918 --> 22:08.523
- Sean! Sean.
- Oh, my god. Is that Cavanaugh?

22:08.557 --> 22:10.358
- Jane, call 911.
- Cavanaugh: No! No!

22:10.392 --> 22:12.460
- No?
- I said no.

22:12.495 --> 22:13.761
That's an order, Rizzoli.

22:13.795 --> 22:15.629
- Angela, get me a towel.
- Okay.

22:15.663 --> 22:18.731
And his pants, too, 
while you're at it.

22:24.657 --> 22:26.657
What the hell happened to me? 

22:26.692 --> 22:29.760
It appears you experienced
a vasovagal episode.

22:29.794 --> 22:32.629
I went out to ... 
I had to get some air.

22:32.663 --> 22:36.302
- You live in Dorchester.
- I got light-headed is all.

22:36.337 --> 22:39.771
- Is that how your pants fell off?
- Jane, don't embarrass him.

22:39.805 --> 22:42.575
Him? I've never
been so embarrassed in my life!

22:42.609 --> 22:44.746
Well, your dizziness could have
been caused by sexual arousal

22:44.780 --> 22:47.452
and the sudden rush of
blood to your genitals.

22:47.486 --> 22:48.619
Oh, my god.

22:48.653 --> 22:51.553
Angela: Okay, we weren't making love.
We were just making out.

22:51.588 --> 22:53.621
I'm gonna have a vasovagal
episode if you don't stop.

22:53.655 --> 22:55.322
Please. I beg you.

22:55.356 --> 22:57.793
- You should go to the hospital.
- No!

22:57.828 --> 23:00.868
Maybe you could just 
stitch his head up?

23:00.902 --> 23:02.438
Well, we need to know

When was the last time
you ate, lieutenant?

Well, he got his meals at the café.
Same as you two.

23:06.745 --> 23:10.347
I might have skipped lunch...
and dinner.

23:10.382 --> 23:12.884
You said my healthy food was
sensational and delicious.

and my boss been seeing each other?

23:28.702 --> 23:32.637
- We are not going there.
- You are in a slip, and my boss

is on my best
friend's couch in his underwear!

23:35.647 --> 23:38.085
What do you have to say for yourself?

23:42.488 --> 23:44.991
Well, I still think you
need to be seen in the E.R.

23:45.025 --> 23:49.563
No. Look, no one else can
know about this incident.

23:49.598 --> 23:52.600
You know what? I'm just gonna
get in my car and go home.

Do you think I'm building 
muscle mass?

Well, I'm sure it's not the
doughnuts I saw in your desk drawer.

24:19.103 --> 24:21.570
Oh, I saw you eating a
contraband doughnut this morning.

24:21.604 --> 24:23.505
You wellness snitch.

24:25.043 --> 24:29.916
- Nice jogging, Rizzoli.
- Thank you, sir.

- What happened to your head?
- Oh, I slipped and fell.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.594
So, where we at on the Slater case?

24:36.628 --> 24:41.803
Uh, well, both the suspects
have alibis. So nowhere, really.

24:41.837 --> 24:43.808
Slater used pseudonyms
for all the drug addicts

24:43.842 --> 24:46.444
and chat-room suicide
folks he wrote about.

24:46.479 --> 24:49.614
Okay, so run them down, people.

- Too many whole grains?

25:13.937 --> 25:18.609
Hmm. Maybe there was
something in his second book.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.646
Maybe he was gonna reveal
something that got him murdered.

Where did Slater go after he
was treated at mass general?

25:34.171 --> 25:36.707
Frost: After Slater was discharged,

25:36.742 --> 25:40.211
he did 90 days of rehab at the
Breyer mental health center.

25:40.246 --> 25:41.914
Maybe he met somebody there ...

25:41.948 --> 25:44.017
Somebody who didn't want
their story in his books.

Yeah, Frost. You don't
have to ask us. Go.

26:05.610 --> 26:07.711
Detective Frost, this is Ann Stephens.

Thank you so much for coming
in to talk to us about Katrina.

26:10.751 --> 26:12.854
I'm not really sure why I'm here.

26:12.888 --> 26:15.258
I already told the
jury everything I know.

We just wanted to ask
you a few questions

26:18.017 --> 26:19.832
about Katrina and Quentin Morris.

26:19.867 --> 26:22.570
He murdered her. I testified.

We think you're holding something back.

- Now's the time.
- I'm not.

26:40.194 --> 26:42.295
His attorney did this to me, too.

26:43.861 --> 26:48.898
Your body is giving you away.
There's something you're holding back.

26:50.301 --> 26:53.740
[ voice breaking ] 
I warned her.

26:53.774 --> 26:56.007
Katrina? 
You warned Katrina?

26:56.041 --> 27:00.807
But she wouldn't listen.
She'd already fallen for him.

27:00.842 --> 27:07.218
He wasn't really one of us. I told
her not to let him in her room.

27:07.252 --> 27:11.185
- You mean Quentin?
- Yes.

27:11.219 --> 27:14.389

- Yes.

27:14.423 --> 27:16.091
Why didn't you tell anyone that?

27:16.125 --> 27:18.761
Because then I'd be helping
him get away with it.

27:18.795 --> 27:21.859
- You mean Quentin?
- He beat my best friend to death.

27:21.893 --> 27:26.662
- What if he didn't?
- I saw Quentin leave her room.

27:26.696 --> 27:30.132
I went to the bathroom, 
came back, and found her body.

27:30.167 --> 27:35.236
He killed her. I mean,
who else could have, right?

Never got on the plane.

His assistant, Chad, was
the last person to see him.

I don't think Dr. Breyer

have been holding it.

double the national average.

can quiet the monkey-mind chatter

- Hmm.

evidence to support your theory.

Sharing is caring.

There's a sticky substance
on Dr. Breyer's right hand.

It could be the same
substance that you found

31:06.416 --> 31:09.152
on Ethan Slater's neck.
Have you gotten those results back yet?

31:09.186 --> 31:12.791
- Trace is still working on it.
- It must be from the killer's gloves.

31:12.826 --> 31:15.028
Maybe Breyer shook
hands with the killer.

31:15.431 --> 31:17.065
Call me when you find something, okay?

31:17.100 --> 31:18.700
All right.

31:20.039 --> 31:22.838
That little scrap of paper
we found near Breyer's hand

31:22.872 --> 31:24.373
was from the corner of a personal check.

31:24.407 --> 31:28.011
- Any idea what bank issued it?
- Not yet. Susie's working on it.

31:28.045 --> 31:30.146
I'm gonna guess that
somebody lured Dr. Breyer

31:30.181 --> 31:33.747
up to his new wing with
the promise of a big payoff.

31:33.781 --> 31:35.283
Huh.

31:35.317 --> 31:37.352
Well, Slater's murder was
staged to look like a suicide.

31:37.386 --> 31:43.025
- Then the killer steals his manuscript.
- Then kills Dr. Breyer? Why?

31:43.060 --> 31:46.028
Well, Breyer treated Slater in rehab.

31:46.062 --> 31:48.162
Maybe Dr. Breyer knew what
Ethan Slater was writing about.

31:48.196 --> 31:53.134
So the good doctor blackmails the killer
by offering to keep quiet for a price?

31:55.437 --> 31:57.171
Oh, I sent Frankie to Breyer's
center to get the records.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.440
Frankie: I found seven
patients who were hospitalized

31:59.475 --> 32:02.444
- at the same time as Slater.
- Nice, Frankie.

32:02.478 --> 32:06.852
- Okay, uh, rock-star drug addict.
- Died last year of a drug overdose.

32:06.886 --> 32:09.826
- Suicidal brahmin shipping heiress.
- Back in treatment.

32:09.860 --> 32:13.161
The other five are living healthy
lives in other parts of the country.

32:13.195 --> 32:18.000
You know, I bet if we find Slater's
manuscript, we'll find his killer.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.375
Frost, what's wrong?

32:21.409 --> 32:24.448
I went over the prep-school
murder case files again.

Thought I might discover
something after questioning Ann.

32:28.050 --> 32:31.923
No one but Quentin enters
or exits Katrina's dorm room.

32:31.957 --> 32:37.262
Maybe Ann was right.
Maybe Quentin did kill her.

32:37.296 --> 32:38.462
Why don't you take a
couple hours, Frost.

32:38.497 --> 32:42.268
- Drive out to Amherst.
- Yeah. Take a look at the crime scene.

32:42.302 --> 32:44.470
See if the state police
overlooked anything.

32:44.505 --> 32:47.476
Nah.
 Nah. I'm done.

32:47.511 --> 32:49.478

I don't think he's even had

Well, that explains some things. I...
Oh, I wish he had told me.

Wow. A typewriter. 
Makes me feel old.

34:11.161 --> 34:14.866
No, don't feel old. A very young
victim liked writing books on one.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.467
- It's an old Underwood.
- I used to have one.

34:17.502 --> 34:20.205
I used to type up plumbing
invoices for Frank Sr.

34:20.239 --> 34:24.947
Changing those typewriter
ribbons was such a mess.

My new C.I. may have just offered
up a breakthrough in the case.

A 1930s Underwood model 5.

34:44.129 --> 34:46.464
Jack Kerouac used to
use one just like it.

34:46.498 --> 34:49.034
How in the world do you know that?

34:49.070 --> 34:50.471
Well, I saw his typewriter on display

34:50.505 --> 34:52.371
at the Lowell national
historical park museum.

34:52.406 --> 34:53.974
We're in luck.

34:54.007 --> 34:55.377
Slater's typewriter uses
a single-pass carbon ribbon.

34:55.411 --> 34:57.279
That's good news.

34:57.314 --> 35:01.051
Yes, it's the most wonderful news
I've ever heard. Why do we care?

35:01.085 --> 35:04.452
Well, some older typewriters
use fabric ribbon,

35:04.486 --> 35:07.185
and those don't retain a
retrievable, legible text.

35:07.219 --> 35:09.955
But with a carbon ribbon,
each keystroke makes a mark.

35:09.989 --> 35:11.390
We write down the characters,

35:11.425 --> 35:12.959
then figure out where the
breaks go between the words.

35:12.993 --> 35:14.294
It'll take awhile.

35:14.329 --> 35:15.662
Susie: The trace results
on the sticky substance

35:15.696 --> 35:17.161
from both the victims
is back, Dr. Isles.

35:17.195 --> 35:20.199
Thank you, Susie.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.705
- What is it?
- Balsam fir sap.

35:23.740 --> 35:27.778
The same sap that was on Ethan
Slater's body and Dr. Breyer's body?

35:29.382 --> 35:31.250
All right, well, don't look so
surprised. We're looking for one killer.

35:31.284 --> 35:35.189
Yeah, but fragments of
Solidago Macrophylla.

35:35.223 --> 35:36.391
What? What is it?

35:36.425 --> 35:38.627
[ beeping ]

35:38.662 --> 35:41.362
These are the M.E. files that
Frost asked me to look at.

35:41.396 --> 35:43.797
- The prep-school murder?
- Yes, and they have

35:43.798 --> 35:47.101
the same balsam fir and
fragments of Solidago Macrophylla.

35:47.135 --> 35:49.171
Yeah, it was found in Katrina's closet.

35:49.205 --> 35:52.171
Yeah, but it wasn't considered significant
because Katrina was a rock climber.

35:52.206 --> 35:55.537
It still isn't. Balsam fir trees
are common all over the northeast.

35:55.571 --> 35:58.140
But Solidago Macrophylla isn't.

35:58.175 --> 36:01.211
It's unique to the summit of
Mount Greylock in the Berkshires.

36:01.245 --> 36:05.746
So whoever killed Katrina,
Ethan Slater, and Dr. Breyer

36:05.780 --> 36:09.614
would have to be a skilled climber
to get to the top of Mount Greylock.

36:15.690 --> 36:19.256
I'm glad I took your advice
and drove out to Amherst. 

36:19.290 --> 36:22.541
Okay, if that grappling hook
is for the wellness program,

36:22.542 --> 36:25.660
you can count me out.
I am not a fan of heights.

36:25.695 --> 36:28.963
Aww, I thought we'd take
Korsak and climb Everest.

36:28.997 --> 36:30.798
Okay, maybe Everest. 
[ chuckles ]

36:30.832 --> 36:32.599
I want to show you something I found

36:32.634 --> 36:34.162
when I was looking around
Katrina's old dorm room.

36:34.274 --> 36:36.736
- Okay.
- This is the building's exterior.

36:36.771 --> 36:38.402
You see those marks?

36:38.437 --> 36:40.937
Yeah. You think those
are from a grappling hook?

36:40.971 --> 36:44.343
Yeah, I do.
I think that's why no one saw him

36:44.377 --> 36:46.414
and why Quentin was the only
one on the hallway security tape.

36:46.448 --> 36:50.317
So Katrina's killer climbed the wall
and went in through her window.

36:50.352 --> 36:51.918
Now, check this out.

36:53.953 --> 36:56.791
Oh, that's the guy who stopped you
in the lobby with his father.

36:56.825 --> 36:59.929
- Bradley Palmer, right?
- Yeah, he was Katrina's boyfriend.

36:59.963 --> 37:03.435
They used to lead climbs together
in the White Mountain national forest.

37:03.469 --> 37:07.539
- You see that?
- Alpine butterfly bend.

37:07.574 --> 37:09.910
That's the same knot
used to hang Slater.

37:09.944 --> 37:11.514
I sent Frankie to Slater's building.

37:11.548 --> 37:13.484
He took some photos of
the building's exterior.

37:14.519 --> 37:17.488
Grappling marks.

37:17.522 --> 37:19.022
He got into Slater's
apartment the same way.

37:19.057 --> 37:20.791
But here's what doesn't
make any sense ...

37:20.825 --> 37:24.630
what is his connection
to Slater and Slater's rehab doctor?

37:24.664 --> 37:27.502
Dr. Breyer?  I have no idea.
[ cellphone vibrates ]

37:28.972 --> 37:31.474
It's Maura. She says we need
to get down to the crime lab.

37:32.977 --> 37:34.945
What's up?

37:34.979 --> 37:37.686
Slater was a terrible
typist with bad grammar.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.790
Look at this ... he uses
"who" instead of "whom,"

37:40.825 --> 37:43.959
- "which" instead of "that."
- Well, no wonder somebody killed him.

37:43.993 --> 37:45.693
[ laughs ]
Here's what's odd ...

37:45.727 --> 37:48.061
Ethan Slater started typing
the last page of his manuscript

37:48.096 --> 37:49.599
three months ago.

37:49.633 --> 37:51.771
So what was he typing
for the last three months?

37:51.805 --> 37:53.842
All kinds of things ...
letters, poems, essays.

37:53.876 --> 37:57.079
But not one word of this manuscript
until right before he was killed.

37:57.113 --> 37:58.681
Well, do you have that last page?

37:58.716 --> 38:01.121
We certainly do, thanks
to Sergeant Korsak.

38:01.205 --> 38:03.506
- No, no, thanks to you, Dr. Isles.
- Oh, please, Sergeant.

38:03.591 --> 38:05.056
I couldn't have done
it without your help.

38:05.091 --> 38:08.060
Okay, we'll throw you both
a parade later. What does it say?

38:08.095 --> 38:13.536
"He told me after a group session
while he ate a turkey sandwich

38:13.570 --> 38:17.504
that he'd beaten Katrina to death
because she cheated on him."

38:17.538 --> 38:19.770
Slater's talking about Bradley Palmer,

38:19.804 --> 38:22.307
- Katrina's boyfriend.
- Maura: Yes, he was.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.643
And this was the last
sentence that he typed.

38:24.677 --> 38:28.115
"Bradley Palmer showed
up the same day I did

38:28.150 --> 38:29.649
at Breyer mental health center,

38:29.683 --> 38:32.450
but I'd take my suicide
attempt over what he did.

38:32.484 --> 38:35.355
He killed his girlfriend."

38:35.389 --> 38:38.929
Damn. And Slater 
and Dr. Breyer to keep them quiet.

38:40.436 --> 38:43.405
But why now? 
Unless...

38:43.439 --> 38:47.173
Frost, did Quentin have any legal
proceedings three months ago?

38:47.207 --> 38:50.111
Yeah. His final appeal
hearing, but it was postponed.

38:50.145 --> 38:52.516
Till yesterday. 
That's why now.

38:52.550 --> 38:55.586
Slater must have hoped
Quentin would get a new trial.

38:56.421 --> 38:59.387
And when he didn't, Slater made
sure that book was ready to go

38:59.421 --> 39:01.621
if Bradley didn't come clean.

39:02.490 --> 39:06.098
Eric Palmer gave me this check.

39:11.505 --> 39:13.071
What do you think?

39:13.106 --> 39:15.609
It appears to be the
same stock and design.

39:29.727 --> 39:31.162
Nice.

39:31.196 --> 39:34.770
Detective Frost, oh, nice to see you.

39:34.804 --> 39:37.274
Bradley: Would you and your
friends like to try our wall?

39:37.308 --> 39:40.378
We had it set up for our
employees to build team skills.

39:40.413 --> 39:43.517
Ethan Slater told you that
if you didn't tell the truth,

39:43.552 --> 39:46.156
he would tell it for
you in his second book.

39:46.190 --> 39:48.892
- What's this about?
- Oh, I think you know, Mr. Palmer.

39:48.927 --> 39:50.326
That's why you hid your
son at a fancy rehab center

39:50.360 --> 39:53.397
- after he killed his girlfriend.
- That's ridiculous.

39:53.431 --> 39:56.168
Is it?
Is it also ridiculous that your son 

39:56.203 --> 39:58.404
climbed up the
side of his girlfriend's dorm,

39:58.438 --> 40:00.141
hid in her closet, 
and beat her to death

40:00.176 --> 40:01.509
after he caught her with Quentin?

40:01.543 --> 40:03.510
- Y-you can't prove anything.
- Bradley!

40:03.545 --> 40:06.513
- Quentin Morris was convicted.
- I think I'm just gonna call our lawyers.

40:06.548 --> 40:08.849
Do you pay your lawyers
with a personal check?

40:11.522 --> 40:13.492
Eric Palmer, you're under arrest
for accessory-after-the-fact

40:13.526 --> 40:14.794
in the murder of Katrina.

40:14.828 --> 40:16.729
Bradley: Dad, dad, you
got to do something.

40:16.764 --> 40:20.184
Bradley Palmer, you're
under arrest for the murders

40:20.185 --> 40:23.604
of Ethan Slater, Dr. George Breyer,
and Katrina Livingston.

40:30.345 --> 40:34.450
<i>Look at that. 
Quentin Morris' mother.</i>

40:34.484 --> 40:36.186
It's amazing.

40:36.221 --> 40:38.591
Her son was going to a prison
for a murder he didn't commit.

40:38.625 --> 40:39.860
Now he's coming home.

40:39.894 --> 40:42.326
How long until Quentin gets released?

40:42.360 --> 40:44.759
He should be home by
the end of the week.

40:44.794 --> 40:47.592
Bet your blood pressure's
a lot lower now, huh?

40:47.627 --> 40:50.430
I always thought the
greatest feeling in the world

40:50.465 --> 40:51.933
was putting away bad guys.

40:51.968 --> 40:53.601
- It's not?
- No.

40:53.636 --> 40:57.668
The greatest feeling in the world
is freeing an innocent man.

40:57.702 --> 40:59.634
Nicely done, Frost.

40:59.668 --> 41:02.671
All in all, a fine
day for the good guys.

41:02.705 --> 41:05.777
Clearing three murders ...
that's a whole lot of wellness, right?

41:05.811 --> 41:07.244
[ chuckles ]

41:07.278 --> 41:09.211
I wonder what happened
to the manuscript.

41:09.245 --> 41:12.512
I'm guessing it went to a shredder
at Palmer industries.

41:13.581 --> 41:16.518
I don't think anybody
ordered a red wine.

41:16.552 --> 41:18.654
[ clears throat ] 
Actually, I did.

41:18.688 --> 41:20.288
What?

41:21.323 --> 41:24.425
Well, it's like Maura's
always saying ...

41:24.460 --> 41:27.963
the resveratrol in red wine is
excellent for cardiac health.

41:27.997 --> 41:31.766
- You actually listen to me?
- Most of the time, yeah.

41:31.800 --> 41:34.267
Well, this deserves a toast.
 Salud!

41:34.301 --> 41:37.122
<i>All: Salud!</i>
