WEBVTT

01:03.565 --> 01:04.649
Not a single thing.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.651
- What do we do?
- Police line.

01:07.318 --> 01:08.653
No one goes in or out.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.530
But there are other entrances.

01:11.322 --> 01:12.532
Just make it look good.

01:30.008 --> 01:31.134
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:47.025 --> 01:48.735
How are you, Mrs. Denning?

01:52.822 --> 01:54.198
We haven't found him.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.828
Not him, not the others.

02:59.305 --> 03:01.599
<i>Our town has been dead for six years.</i>

03:03.434 --> 03:05.853
<i>At first, we blamed the closing of the mine,</i>

03:06.771 --> 03:08.231
<i>the lack of jobs,</i>

03:08.773 --> 03:10.108
<i>the lack of money,</i>

03:10.441 --> 03:11.943
<i>the lack of everything.</i>

03:12.777 --> 03:15.321
<i>But then, we had much worse to blame,</i>

03:15.405 --> 03:17.615
<i>for something had come to Cold Rock.</i>

03:17.824 --> 03:18.950
<i>Something bad</i>

03:19.367 --> 03:22.120
<i>that was destroying our town even more.</i>

03:22.704 --> 03:27.291
<i>That morning, nobody knew the Cold Rock</i>
<i>case was reaching its conclusion.</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:29.836
Don't drink out
in the street, Crawley.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.587
What street?

04:03.369 --> 04:04.537
Julia!

04:11.669 --> 04:13.713
Julia! Some help here, please!

04:17.507 --> 04:18.509
What happened?

04:18.593 --> 04:19.802
I don't know.
She just started screaming

04:19.844 --> 04:20.970
all of a sudden, out of nowhere.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.180
How long has she been like this?

04:22.221 --> 04:23.431
I don't know.

04:26.184 --> 04:27.810
Oh, my God!

04:27.852 --> 04:28.978
You didn't know?

04:30.271 --> 04:31.856
I'm not equipped for this, Tracy.

04:32.190 --> 04:35.067
Push! Yes. You're doing it. You're doing it.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.279
Good, good.
Now when the contraction comes again,

04:38.362 --> 04:39.822
push where you feel my fingers, okay?

04:39.864 --> 04:42.408
Push where my fingers are.
Down, push deep and down.

04:42.492 --> 04:43.659
Push.

04:44.035 --> 04:47.955
Good, push. Push.
You're doing it. You're doing it.

04:48.039 --> 04:50.041
You're doing it. Very good, very good.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.044
Now do it again.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.548
Come on. There you go.

04:57.590 --> 04:58.925
Here it comes, here it comes.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.468
Good girl. That's it.

05:02.637 --> 05:03.888
Okay.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.641
Okay, it's breech,
which means the feet are coming first,

05:06.724 --> 05:08.351
but it's fine. It's fine.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.520
- I just need you to push really, really hard.
- Yes, you can.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.021
- Really big push for me.
- Come on, let's go.

05:14.232 --> 05:16.484
Push. Push, Carol!

05:23.908 --> 05:27.745
You did it. There it is. There it is. You did it.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.291
Why is there no sound?

05:33.167 --> 05:36.003
The baby's fine. It's good. It's good.

05:36.087 --> 05:37.421
Take her out. Take her out!

05:38.798 --> 05:40.883
Good work.
Good work. That is my girl.

05:40.925 --> 05:42.301
You did such a good job.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.761
- But the baby...
- I know, honey...

05:43.803 --> 05:45.763
Julia is going to take
very good care of him.

05:45.805 --> 05:47.098
I promise you. I promise.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.517
Come on, baby. Come on, wake up.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.271
Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Come on.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.273
Take a breath. Take a breath.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.108
You can make it. You can make it.

06:02.697 --> 06:04.866
Come on. Breathe. Come on, now. Breathe.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.870
Breathe. Breathe for me. Come on.

06:08.953 --> 06:10.162
Come on.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.791
Okay. Come on.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.461
Breathe.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.130
Breathe.

06:20.089 --> 06:23.092
You can do this.
Come on, come on. You can make it.

06:23.843 --> 06:25.011
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.141
Okay.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.185
There you are. There you are.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.563
Hello.

06:50.661 --> 06:51.996
It's a big boy.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.333
No hospital, Julia.

06:56.334 --> 06:57.627
He needs monitoring, Tracy.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.171
No. No way.

07:13.309 --> 07:14.685
Steven.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.147
That bastard never made
a secret of the fact he likes my girls.

07:19.023 --> 07:21.692
He's always parading around
in front of them like a rooster,

07:21.776 --> 07:25.112
bare-chested and cocky
with those stupid cowboy boots.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.908
Always showing them
things and teaching them this and that

07:28.991 --> 07:31.369
and Carol falling for all of it.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.371
Did you realize?

07:34.664 --> 07:36.499
No! God, no.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.627
If I had, I would have shot him, bang-bang.
Goodbye, cowboy.

07:40.962 --> 07:42.046
Get rid of him.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.635
This is nobody else's business,
Julia, but ours.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.345
No hospital.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.681
They won't ask any questions.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.600
No, we won't go.
I won't put Carol through that shame.

07:55.434 --> 07:56.894
She's not even 18.

07:59.355 --> 08:01.732
We take care of our own problems, okay?

08:04.652 --> 08:05.945
<i>In Cold ROCK,</i>

08:06.028 --> 08:08.990
<i>sometimes children were born</i>
<i>when they were not wanted.</i>

08:10.908 --> 08:12.076
<i>People just managed,</i>

08:12.118 --> 08:14.745
<i>and they didn't go</i>
<i>hollering it from the rooftops.</i>

08:15.788 --> 08:18.916
<i>It may have been a bit sad,</i>
<i>but it was just good sense.</i>

08:19.917 --> 08:21.836
<i>Because a lot worse things were happening</i>

08:21.919 --> 08:24.088
<i>when it came to the children.</i>

08:25.047 --> 08:26.799
<i>Wanted or not,</i>

08:27.174 --> 08:30.428
<i>boys and girls,</i>
<i>some of them just disappeared.</i>

08:31.762 --> 08:35.515
<i>Something had come to Cold Rock</i>
<i>that was taking the children.</i>

08:36.267 --> 08:38.144
<i>Something so menacing,</i>

08:38.769 --> 08:40.270
<i>so terrifying,</i>

08:41.188 --> 08:43.441
<i>that the people finally gave it a name.</i>

08:49.321 --> 08:50.906
<i>She was in her room,</i>

08:51.282 --> 08:52.908
<i>a few minutes earlier</i>

08:53.284 --> 08:54.869
<i>and I came back and...</i>

08:54.952 --> 08:57.455
<i>And she was gone. She was just gone.</i>

08:59.665 --> 09:01.625
<i>There wasn't a sound.</i>
<i>There was no screaming.</i>

09:02.501 --> 09:04.795
<i>There was nothing. I just...</i>
<i>I went outside and he was gone.</i>

09:06.047 --> 09:08.883
<i>I just wish. ..</i>
<i>I just wish I could have been there.</i>

09:08.966 --> 09:10.968
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>
<i>I looked up and down the street.</i>

09:11.010 --> 09:12.845
<i>I couldn't see her anywhere. I panicked.</i>

09:13.763 --> 09:16.307
<i>And all I could think of was the Tall Man.</i>

09:16.390 --> 09:17.725
<i>I think he's the Devil.</i>

09:17.808 --> 09:19.518
<i>What kind of people take people's kids?</i>

09:19.602 --> 09:20.686
<i>You're talking about the Tall Man?</i>

09:20.770 --> 09:22.646
<i>No, that's a myth. There's no Tall Man.</i>

09:22.688 --> 09:23.731
<i>He exists.</i>

09:23.814 --> 09:25.274
<i>The only Tall Man</i>
<i>I've ever is seen is the one</i>

09:25.316 --> 09:26.692
<i>the kids built of that scarecrow over there.</i>

09:26.776 --> 09:29.820
<i>If this was a rich town, we'd have</i>
<i>the whole army here looking for those kids.</i>

09:30.196 --> 09:34.200
<i>I saw him two times,</i>
<i>going into the forest at night time.</i>

09:34.283 --> 09:37.411
<i>It was right there</i>
<i>like he was trying to avoid the bridge.</i>

09:37.495 --> 09:38.704
<i>It's such a big place.</i>

09:38.788 --> 09:41.499
<i>We've got so many places</i>
<i>for someone to hide.</i>

10:57.575 --> 10:59.994
What're you talking about?
What else could it be?

11:00.077 --> 11:01.954
Of course it's a child molester.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.206
The kind of asshole
who really hurts the kids, you know?

11:04.248 --> 11:05.499
All I'm saying is...

11:05.583 --> 11:07.334
Well, what you say is bullshit, Chestnut.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.545
It's not the bogeyman or the Devil

11:09.587 --> 11:11.505
or any of that old wives' tale crap.

11:11.589 --> 11:12.715
Tall man, my ass.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.426
The guy's got a name
and he'll shit himself like anyone else

11:15.509 --> 11:17.428
when we drag him to the chair.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.014
You know about a lot of things,
don't you, Douglas?

11:20.598 --> 11:22.266
Give me another hit there, Beth.

11:23.309 --> 11:25.769
I was sitting back there
listening to you tell us your...

11:25.811 --> 11:26.937
Your life story.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.772
Yeah, well, all I'm sayin' is,

11:28.814 --> 11:30.524
you aren't here to catch a ghost, right?

11:32.151 --> 11:33.319
Noted.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.196
I'm just making conversation.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.322
I hear that.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.616
Cheers. Cheers!

11:38.699 --> 11:39.783
Yeah.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.832
Ladies. Gents.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.629
The dark knight is back.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.757
Arrived this morning.
He's already on his fourth cup of coffee.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.091
Short black, no sugar.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.470
Well, he's got to sit up all night in his car.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.721
Hi, guys.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.097
- Hey.
- Hi, Julia.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.140
He's going to start messing about,

12:03.224 --> 12:05.434
making his bullshit rounds
and all that for what?

12:05.476 --> 12:06.602
You mean Dodd?

12:07.269 --> 12:08.395
I mean Sherlock Holmes.

12:08.479 --> 12:09.647
Yeah, like clockwork.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.565
The last kid disappeared
two months ago.

12:11.649 --> 12:13.651
Won't be long before the next one goes.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.694
Dodd's back on the trail.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.529
What difference will that make, huh, Julia?

12:17.613 --> 12:19.490
This town's already finished.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.200
Yeah, I guess everyone's feeling pretty down.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.077
Tell me about that.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.120
- Mrs. Johnson.
- She's gone.

12:25.496 --> 12:26.789
Oh, I haven't seen her in weeks.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.500
Sweet Jesus!
She looks even worse than before.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.544
She wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.713
She wouldn't mind a winning lottery ticket.

12:46.976 --> 12:49.019
For you, Mrs. Johnson, from Trish.

12:53.274 --> 12:54.483
Don't you want it?

12:55.776 --> 12:57.653
I think it might do you some good.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.414
Whoa!

13:08.497 --> 13:10.249
I know I might have blacked out last night

13:10.332 --> 13:12.918
celebrating the birth of my baby boy

13:13.002 --> 13:15.504
but I know I didn't order up no nurse.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.589
Good morning to you too, Steven.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.009
What the hell you doin' here?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.176
Just picking up the pieces.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.178
Really? And who do you think you are?

13:23.846 --> 13:25.222
I know who I am.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.683
And what the fuck that's supposed to mean?

13:27.725 --> 13:29.560
I'm talking to ya.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.354
What? What, do you want to hit me too?

13:32.396 --> 13:35.524
Stay out of our business.
I really care about Carol.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.235
I know. Like you care about your bike.

13:38.277 --> 13:40.654
I don't like your style.

13:40.738 --> 13:42.239
Now, may he rest in peace,

13:42.323 --> 13:44.742
your husband left behind
some pretty big shoes to fill.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.244
After all, he was a doctor,
you're just a nurse.

13:47.328 --> 13:49.204
Stick to changing diapers
and get off my back.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.837
- Hey, Tracy.
- Hey.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.630
- Come on in and take a seat.
- Thanks.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.550
So how is that sweet boy?

14:01.592 --> 14:04.887
Oh, it's okay actually.
I sent them away to my sister's in Seattle.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.973
She's got a big house and you know,
they're close to everything

14:08.432 --> 14:10.100
and they're just kind of better off.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.603
Carol's in no shape to travel, Tracy.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.605
Yeah, but they made it there fine.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.607
Okay, Julia, look, I still
got to make a living, okay?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.776
I got a job interview in Kaslo in 45 minutes.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.444
Good pay, good job, good tips.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.946
I can't be here all day to help Carol, okay?
You gotta understand me.

14:23.322 --> 14:24.490
Yeah, I get it.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.116
No, you know what? I gotta hold on, Julia.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.786
No, honestly.
Honestly, Trace, I understand.

14:31.163 --> 14:33.040
You want me to make you
some coffee or something?

14:33.707 --> 14:34.792
He's still here?

14:36.377 --> 14:39.129
Yeah. You got to give me
some time with that, okay?

14:39.338 --> 14:42.633
It's not so simple. He's...
He's kinda hard to handle.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.677
But trust me,
you just got to let me handle this.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.429
What about Jenny?

14:55.687 --> 14:56.772
Hey.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.609
Your mom went to Kaslo.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.616
Ta-da.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.003
You haven't been doing
your speech therapy, have you?

15:31.181 --> 15:32.516
Okay.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.518
I'm here now.

15:35.144 --> 15:37.146
So... Speak.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.907
Why are you always
hiding behind all this hair?

15:48.991 --> 15:50.659
You're so pretty.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.217
So, you believe it too?

16:21.565 --> 16:23.400
<i>It was like an ancient legend.</i>

16:24.401 --> 16:26.570
<i>Something from a book of fairy tales</i>

16:27.237 --> 16:28.864
<i>or an old song.</i>

16:30.532 --> 16:32.910
<i>Everyone talked about</i>
<i>the Tall Man all the time</i>

16:32.993 --> 16:34.745
<i>because everyone was afraid of him.</i>

16:36.079 --> 16:38.582
<i>People were always afraid he'd strike again</i>

16:39.583 --> 16:41.168
<i>and when he did,</i>

16:41.251 --> 16:44.421
<i>they'd thank their lucky stars</i>
<i>he took someone else's kid.</i>

16:45.422 --> 16:48.425
<i>Maybe they felt a little guilty</i>
<i>thinking that way,</i>

16:48.509 --> 16:50.594
<i>but that feeling didn't last long.</i>

16:51.220 --> 16:54.139
<i>For everyone's got</i>
<i>their problems to deal with.</i>

16:54.848 --> 16:56.642
<i>It's not just good or bad,</i>

16:57.392 --> 16:59.353
<i>it's just the way it is.</i>

17:36.765 --> 17:38.016
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.768
- Done for today?
- Yeah.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.771
- Oh, there's some more groceries in the car.
- Okay.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.022
Hey, is everything okay?

17:44.106 --> 17:46.066
Yeah, he's been looking forward
to you getting home.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.484
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.051
Yes?

18:17.556 --> 18:18.890
Hey, sweetheart.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.268
That's a beautiful song.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.352
Oh.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.859
So, Christine told me you missed me today.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.235
Uh-huh.

18:30.319 --> 18:31.820
Well, I missed you too.

18:32.863 --> 18:34.114
What did you do all day?

18:34.865 --> 18:36.950
We made a baking soda volcano.

18:37.034 --> 18:39.119
- And you made it erupt?
- Yeah.

18:39.202 --> 18:40.203
How did you do that?

18:40.245 --> 18:42.873
You put, um, baking soda
and then we put vinegar

18:42.956 --> 18:44.875
and then it exploded everywhere.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.793
Whoa!

18:46.877 --> 18:49.087
Oh, guess what
we're having for dinner tonight?

18:49.171 --> 18:50.922
- What?
- Brussels sprouts.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.507
Ew!

19:05.228 --> 19:07.189
Hey guys!
Dinner in half an hour.

19:07.773 --> 19:08.774
Okay.

19:08.857 --> 19:09.900
Whoo!

19:14.154 --> 19:15.322
Whoa, what's that?

19:15.781 --> 19:17.032
That's a gorilla.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.116
Where does he live?

19:18.200 --> 19:21.536
He lives in um... Australia.

19:21.578 --> 19:24.331
Think so?
Maybe he could live in the jungle somewhere.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.834
This fish can live in our moat
and he can patrol our waters.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.002
- Yeah.
- So no one can come by

19:29.086 --> 19:30.420
and he'll eat everybody.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.340
Bombs!

19:34.549 --> 19:36.051
Do the number trick. Number trick.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.594
I taught him a number trick. Watch.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.262
- Think of a number.
- Okay.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.347
Double it.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.807
Wait, wait, wait. That's too fast.

19:42.474 --> 19:43.892
Okay, think of a number.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.936
- Double it.
- Okay.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.104
Add on six.

19:47.479 --> 19:48.563
Okay.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.732
Halve it. That means cut it into half.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.652
Take away the first number you thought of.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.112
And your answer is three.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.155
I know! I know!

19:57.906 --> 19:59.783
- It works every time.
- Yeah.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.246
Okay, buddy.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.290
There you go.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.960
Do you still have to go to work tomorrow?

20:10.377 --> 20:11.461
Yeah.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.714
But I'll try not to finish too late.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.466
Can we play together again
when you get home?

20:17.134 --> 20:18.468
I promise.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.770
Good night, David.

20:30.772 --> 20:31.815
So, what did you guys do today?

20:31.898 --> 20:34.192
Oh, it's not what we did, it's what he asked.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.361
What did he ask?

20:36.445 --> 20:37.988
- Brought up the "T" word.
- Oh.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.781
- Television.
- Yeah.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.116
What did you say?

20:41.158 --> 20:43.702
Well, I said it was an evil brainwashing tool

20:43.785 --> 20:46.329
used by big corporations
to corrupt the peoples.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.206
- Good one.
- Thanks.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.417
He did ask me to buy one to watch cartoons.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.169
And how'd you respond?

20:53.170 --> 20:54.713
I chose to ignore
the question.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.047
Right. Of course.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.383
I saw Tracy today.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.011
The baby?

21:01.178 --> 21:02.846
Shipped off to Seattle.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.098
- Typical.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:05.474 --> 21:06.850
I saw Steven too.

21:06.892 --> 21:10.937
He informed me
how shitty I was compared to my husband.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.230
Yeah. Figures.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.191
It's just weird. They just... They... They...

21:14.274 --> 21:16.943
They just feel like
they own a part of him or something.

21:17.027 --> 21:19.529
That's what he meant
to this town, right? He...

21:19.821 --> 21:21.698
- Helped them.
- Well, he tried.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.700
He was a friggin' saint.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.537
I'm just tired of talking about it.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.873
I know I bring it up all the time. I'm sorry.

21:32.626 --> 21:33.710
Ta-da.

21:34.211 --> 21:35.545
Oh, dear Lord.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.256
Oh, you know you love it.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.884
Ah, I don't know. I don't...

21:42.886 --> 21:44.054
How much? How much? Tell me when.

21:44.095 --> 21:45.514
Just. When.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.558
This is going to give me such a headache.

21:48.642 --> 21:50.727
Just drink it. Make it go away.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.230
I don't think I can drink that. This really...

21:59.820 --> 22:02.906
I'm okay. I know I am.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.911
All right, you little devil.

22:09.246 --> 22:10.872
Where are you?

22:51.246 --> 22:53.164
<i>All men have sinned</i>

22:53.248 --> 22:55.876
<i>and fallen short of the glory of God.</i>

22:56.126 --> 22:57.586
<i>We're damned.</i>

22:57.627 --> 22:59.629
<i>We're all going to Hell.</i>

22:59.671 --> 23:01.798
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

23:01.882 --> 23:05.176
<i>The only salvation that is possible for you</i>

23:05.260 --> 23:06.970
<i>is the blood of the Lamb.</i>

23:07.429 --> 23:08.638
Christine?

23:08.722 --> 23:10.140
<i>The Lord Savior, Jesus Christ.</i>

23:10.223 --> 23:13.351
<i>You know, last week I was sitting on a plane</i>

23:13.435 --> 23:16.271
<i>from Memphis to Orlando</i>

23:16.313 --> 23:18.899
<i>and a gentleman sitting next to me,</i>
<i>a very kind man,</i>

23:18.982 --> 23:20.901
<i>he looked at me and he said,</i>

23:20.984 --> 23:24.154
<i>"Pastor, I do good works.</i>

23:24.237 --> 23:26.072
<i>"I take care of my family.</i>

23:26.489 --> 23:28.992
<i>"I look after my friends."</i>

23:29.075 --> 23:30.952
<i>I looked him square in the eye and said,</i>

23:30.994 --> 23:31.995
<i>"That's marvelous.</i>

23:32.078 --> 23:33.663
<i>"Tell the Devil that,</i>

23:33.747 --> 23:35.498
<i>"because you're going to Hell!"</i>

24:12.702 --> 24:14.537
Oh, my God! Christine!

24:18.792 --> 24:21.211
Tell me. Tell me, tell me, tell me.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.730
David! David!

24:44.484 --> 24:45.652
David!

24:48.071 --> 24:49.239
David!

24:52.075 --> 24:53.243
David!

25:01.334 --> 25:02.419
Okay.

25:07.215 --> 25:09.009
Tell me. Tell me.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.326
David!

25:43.668 --> 25:44.836
David!

26:19.871 --> 26:20.997
Stop!

27:02.789 --> 27:04.124
David. David

29:04.327 --> 29:08.623
<i>...difficulties right here</i>

29:09.165 --> 29:11.960
<i>When a child goes missing without a trace,</i>

29:12.168 --> 29:13.336
<i>there's no closure.</i>

29:13.378 --> 29:15.964

<i>You would think that some...</i>

Mrs. Denning?

37:42.636 --> 37:44.513
Shit!

37:44.555 --> 37:46.015
Mrs. Denning!

37:48.893 --> 37:50.770
Here. Here. Let me help you.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.856
Okay? Can you stand?

37:59.195 --> 38:01.155
<i>Lieutenant, request received.</i>

38:01.197 --> 38:03.574
<i>Central is sending reinforcements. Two cars.</i>

38:03.657 --> 38:05.534
<i>They're leaving Seattle right now.</i>

38:05.576 --> 38:08.788
<i>ETA two hours. Repeat, ETA two hours.</i>

38:12.917 --> 38:15.711
<i>Dodd, I'm on my way.</i>
<i>I'm on the highway already.</i>

38:17.505 --> 38:19.507
This is the guy we're looking for, right?

38:20.633 --> 38:21.967
<i>I'm on my way too, Lieutenant.</i>

38:22.051 --> 38:23.677
<i>Going as fast as I can.</i>

38:27.264 --> 38:29.892
We're going to get that son of a bitch.

38:53.165 --> 38:55.459
Come on. You're going to be okay.

38:58.921 --> 38:59.964
You're going to be just fine.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.591
Damn!

39:07.805 --> 39:09.807
- We got an emergency here.
- Oh, my God!

39:10.641 --> 39:13.435
Julia! What happened to you?

39:13.519 --> 39:14.812
I found her on the road.

39:14.895 --> 39:17.189
The asshole who did this is still out there.

39:17.273 --> 39:18.774
Here, take her.

39:19.984 --> 39:21.068
You want me to go with you?

39:21.527 --> 39:24.613
No, you stay here.
Get an ambulance. Take care of her.

39:25.614 --> 39:26.907
You sure?

39:28.117 --> 39:29.118
Everything will be all right.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.412
Yeah.

39:33.163 --> 39:34.290
Okay.

39:39.962 --> 39:42.464
Hey! Give it a rest.

39:43.799 --> 39:44.967
Yeah. Give her some space, huh?

39:48.762 --> 39:50.306
You're hurt, sweetie.

39:50.347 --> 39:51.348
What happened, Julia?

39:59.690 --> 40:01.191
Oh, it's okay.

40:03.527 --> 40:04.862
It's okay.

40:06.238 --> 40:08.824
Now, you wait right here.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.327
I'll be right back.

40:45.945 --> 40:47.321
Go get cleaned up.

40:48.364 --> 40:51.200
I left a towel and
some clean clothes in my office.

40:51.825 --> 40:54.912
And when you're done,
maybe you can tell me what's going on.

40:59.541 --> 41:00.960
Thank you.

41:31.949 --> 41:33.867
I don't know, Douglas.

41:33.909 --> 41:35.244
Think carefully, Sheriff.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.538
Think about your pension.

41:37.579 --> 41:40.290
How far are you away from retirement?
Eight months?

41:40.374 --> 41:41.959
We've got to warn
the department in Pittsville.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.585
Yeah, and the army too, while you're at it.

41:43.627 --> 41:45.254
It wasn't
supposed to happen like this.

41:45.295 --> 41:46.755
And that's why you
have to go to the mine.

41:46.797 --> 41:48.215
I want to know what she's up to.

41:48.257 --> 41:49.466
Jesus Christ!

41:49.550 --> 41:50.718
We're on the same boat, brother.

41:50.759 --> 41:52.803
Don't "brother" me, you prick.

41:52.886 --> 41:54.346
I have to think. Let me think!

41:54.430 --> 41:56.306
Yeah, you do that.

43:09.505 --> 43:11.256
She's looking at the kid's picture.

43:12.883 --> 43:14.343
She suspects something, I could tell you.

43:14.676 --> 43:15.844
What'll we do?

43:17.554 --> 43:19.181
I'll go get her.

43:19.223 --> 43:20.349
Don't move.

43:22.434 --> 43:23.435
Take a seat.

44:00.848 --> 44:01.849
Shit!

44:04.226 --> 44:05.602
She's left!

44:06.436 --> 44:07.896
That bitch is in the forest!

44:09.106 --> 44:10.107
Come on.

44:11.150 --> 44:12.568
Grab what you need out of your trucks.

44:14.570 --> 44:17.865
Steven! I need you to take that group,
take them into the forest.

44:17.906 --> 44:19.491
If you find her, you bring her to me.

44:19.575 --> 44:20.909
I'll find her.

44:20.993 --> 44:23.787
Don't do anything stupid!
You find her, you hang on to her.

44:23.871 --> 44:25.289
Then leave her to me.

44:25.372 --> 44:27.040
Let's get round the back of the building!

44:28.750 --> 44:30.210
If I get a chance,
I'm gonna kill her!

44:32.462 --> 44:34.798
You still need to think, big boy?

44:36.133 --> 44:38.260
Come on. All of us. Let's go!

44:38.343 --> 44:41.138
She's not gonna go far. Let's stop her now.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.110
<i>Sheriff, this is Campbell.</i>

44:55.194 --> 44:58.488
<i>Uh, we just received a call</i>
<i>from the Feds in Seattle.</i>

44:58.572 --> 45:00.324
<i>They're sending reinforcements.</i>

45:00.407 --> 45:02.284
<i>It sounds like Dodd is chasing our guy.</i>

45:03.785 --> 45:05.621
<i>Are you aware of this?</i>

45:19.968 --> 45:21.386
<i>Sheriff, did you get that?</i>

45:22.012 --> 45:23.555
<i>Do you copy, Sheriff?</i>

45:24.556 --> 45:26.683
- Uh, Sheriff?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm copying.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.060
Asshole.

45:28.143 --> 45:29.561
How am I supposed to do this job?

45:29.645 --> 45:31.730
I got two lousy cars, I got a useless deputy,

45:31.939 --> 45:34.066
Feds all over my back...

46:15.399 --> 46:17.401
No, no, no. She's not at home.

46:17.484 --> 46:19.194
She's hiding in the forest.

46:19.278 --> 46:21.780
They'll get her. You stay put. I'll call.

47:23.133 --> 47:25.052
<i>That's a little inappropriate.</i>

47:25.093 --> 47:27.596
<i>I have to stick to lighter reading.</i>

47:29.765 --> 47:32.642
<i>Hold your retrorockets. I'm coming.</i>

47:36.813 --> 47:39.483
<i>I wonder who that could be.</i>

47:40.442 --> 47:42.861
<i>Hi, Poinsy, Merry Christ...</i>

47:44.446 --> 47:45.822
<i>Why, Mr. Felix!</i>

47:48.825 --> 47:52.329
<i>What are you</i>
<i>doing outside on a day like today?</i>

47:52.788 --> 47:54.456
<i>Stand still.</i>

47:57.501 --> 47:59.920
<i>I can't understand you, Mr. Felix.</i>

47:59.961 --> 48:01.588
<i>Let's go inside.</i>

48:02.464 --> 48:05.425
<i>I'll put you somewhere to thaw out.</i>

49:44.441 --> 49:46.943
David. Oh.

49:47.736 --> 49:49.362
David.

50:41.790 --> 50:42.958
Mommy!

50:44.834 --> 50:47.420
It's all over, angel.

50:48.213 --> 50:49.798
Everything's okay.

50:50.966 --> 50:52.384
She scares me.

50:54.219 --> 50:55.971
It's all over, baby.

50:56.596 --> 50:57.973
It's all over.

51:39.306 --> 51:42.017
It took me an hour to calm him down.

51:42.976 --> 51:45.186
Just to get him to recognize me.

51:46.229 --> 51:50.275
Do you know how a mother feels
when her child does not recognize her?

51:51.693 --> 51:53.403
He'd been brainwashed.

51:54.362 --> 51:56.239
You told him I was gone.

51:58.074 --> 52:00.535
What the fuck are you up to?

52:05.874 --> 52:06.916
Last night,

52:08.335 --> 52:11.338
<i>like almost every night, I went into the woods</i>

52:11.379 --> 52:14.090
<i>to try to find the bastard that took my son.</i>

52:16.009 --> 52:17.218
The Tall Man.

52:17.802 --> 52:20.930
Old lady Ashcroft said
she'd seen him twice at nightfall,

52:21.723 --> 52:23.016
so I'd walk.

52:23.933 --> 52:25.060
I walked...

52:26.061 --> 52:27.145
And I walked.

52:29.064 --> 52:31.608
<i>And then, by chance, I came to your house.</i>

52:35.487 --> 52:37.906
<i>Chance or intuition, call it what you like.</i>

52:42.077 --> 52:43.787
<i>And he was there.</i>

52:44.454 --> 52:46.122
<i>I couldn't believe that he was there.</i>

52:48.083 --> 52:51.378
<i>It went around and around</i>
<i>and around in my head,</i>

52:51.419 --> 52:53.129
<i>trying to make sense of it.</i>

52:54.089 --> 52:55.590
<i>Did I dream that?</i>

52:57.926 --> 52:59.719
<i>My mind turned to Trish.</i>

53:01.304 --> 53:04.724
<i>She made an altar for him,</i>
<i>like she did for all the others.</i>

53:05.266 --> 53:07.977
<i>Four candles and prayers for his return.</i>

53:08.561 --> 53:10.897
<i>When you talk to Trish, she listens.</i>

53:13.024 --> 53:14.984
<i>She never saw me as a freak.</i>

53:19.239 --> 53:21.282
<i>She wasn't the first one I saw.</i>

53:23.576 --> 53:25.704
<i>When I looked into your eyes, I knew.</i>

53:26.329 --> 53:27.789
<i>I wasn't mad.</i>

53:29.624 --> 53:31.876
<i>It wasn't enough for you to see me like that?</i>

53:32.127 --> 53:34.504
<i>You had to offer me your God damned coffee?</i>

53:35.130 --> 53:36.464
<i>With your innocent air,</i>

53:36.548 --> 53:37.966
<i>and your angel face, right?</i>

53:38.883 --> 53:40.093
<i>Were you worried?</i>

53:40.719 --> 53:41.803
<i>Did you feel guilty?</i>

53:43.179 --> 53:46.099
Or are you just
the most cynical bitch the world has ever seen

53:46.141 --> 53:49.519
that you offer a coffee
to a woman whose child you kidnapped?

53:53.815 --> 53:55.150
<i>I waited for you to leave.</i>

53:56.651 --> 53:58.486
<i>I waited for the diner to empty.</i>

53:59.571 --> 54:01.531
<i>At first, Trish didn't believe me.</i>

54:02.031 --> 54:04.993
<i>People around here</i>
<i>all trust you, Julia Denning.</i>

54:05.034 --> 54:06.161
<i>But I talked,</i>

54:06.202 --> 54:08.204
<i>and I talked, and I talked</i>

54:08.830 --> 54:10.957
<i>until she started to have doubts.</i>

54:11.833 --> 54:14.544
And when they were
big enough, just big enough,

54:14.794 --> 54:17.255
<i>I told her I was going to get my kid back,</i>

54:17.338 --> 54:19.382
<i>and she said,</i>
<i>"You're going to break into Julia's house?”</i>

54:19.466 --> 54:20.633
<i>And I said,</i>

54:20.675 --> 54:23.344
<i>"if he's not there,</i>
<i>you can drive me to the loony bin yourself."</i>

54:24.012 --> 54:26.473
<i>She decided to keep the diner open all night.</i>

54:27.307 --> 54:29.976
<i>Waiting up for my news</i>
<i>with some of the other regulars.</i>

54:31.186 --> 54:32.854
<i>But it's not me they saw arriving.</i>

54:38.568 --> 54:40.361
When I saw you at the window with my son,

54:40.403 --> 54:42.155
I thought about calling the cops,

54:42.781 --> 54:43.948
but I don't trust them.

54:44.699 --> 54:47.243
All they've ever done for me is
kick me out of my house.

54:47.702 --> 54:48.995
They don't care.

54:49.996 --> 54:52.373
Look where they forced me
to live with my son.

54:55.210 --> 54:58.880
You took my baby away,
and the other children, too.

55:00.381 --> 55:01.549
Where are they?

55:01.841 --> 55:03.551
Where are the other kids?

55:04.969 --> 55:07.972
Julia, you tell me
what you've done with the other children,

55:08.056 --> 55:10.058
or I swear you'll die.

55:12.393 --> 55:14.312
I gave them to the Tall Man.

55:16.481 --> 55:17.732
Who is he?

55:18.900 --> 55:20.360
Don't you know?

55:21.569 --> 55:23.112
The whole town is talking about him.

55:27.367 --> 55:30.119
Don't mess with me, Julia. Who is he?

55:33.248 --> 55:35.041
He's the one everyone's talking about.

55:46.427 --> 55:47.846
Mommy?

55:53.560 --> 55:54.936
Come here, angel.

55:58.022 --> 55:59.899
She won't hurt you anymore.

56:01.901 --> 56:03.611
Look, at my son, Julia,

56:04.028 --> 56:05.530
and tell him you lied.

56:05.864 --> 56:07.448
Tell him you're nothing to him.

56:08.324 --> 56:09.617
He has to hear it from you.

56:48.698 --> 56:50.366
David!

57:08.343 --> 57:09.969
David!

58:22.083 --> 58:23.251
DAVID; No!

58:27.171 --> 58:28.756
Let go! No!

58:50.236 --> 58:51.529
Where'd you learn to do that?

59:00.580 --> 59:02.957
<i>Residents may</i>
<i>know answers this evening.</i>

59:03.041 --> 59:05.543
<i>Police scanners are very busy indeed.</i>

59:05.626 --> 59:07.837
<i>We have noticed a lot of increased traffic.</i>

59:07.920 --> 59:11.466
<i>FBI presence in town, and our news reporter,</i>
<i>Amy Wilkinson is there.</i>

59:12.800 --> 59:14.135
<i>Amy, can you hear me?</i>

59:14.427 --> 59:16.637
<i>Yes, yes, David. Hello. Hi.</i>

59:16.721 --> 59:21.017
<i>Yes, it seems that things</i>
<i>are actually finally starting to happen here...</i>

59:36.741 --> 59:38.076
You did it.

59:38.159 --> 59:40.328
- He's never going back there.
- What happened?

59:41.370 --> 59:42.538
We don't have any time.

59:43.664 --> 59:44.791
The whole town will be here soon.

59:46.501 --> 59:47.668
It's over.

59:58.096 --> 59:59.388
Go home, Jenny.

01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:02.225
Just go home,
and don't say anything to anyone.

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:18.282
Hey.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:32.171
Remember that number trick
that you showed us at dinner?

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.799
You take a number,
multiply it by something,

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:38.177
add six, and it always ends in three?

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:44.934
You don't know what you're talking about.

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:48.062
It's a really good trick. It always worked,

01:00:48.146 --> 01:00:49.480
it's just, I don't remember what you did.

01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:51.357
How does it go again?

01:01:01.951 --> 01:01:03.494
Please don't ask me to do that.

01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:06.038
You couldn't bear it, believe me.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.086
When we were eating
the Brussels sprouts, remember?

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:14.630
It doesn't matter what number you take.

01:01:17.967 --> 01:01:19.302
It's always three.

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:26.184
Jenny knows.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:28.728
She knows.
She's been watching me for weeks.

01:01:28.769 --> 01:01:29.770
That's impossible.

01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:33.608
No, we got comfortable. We got sloppy.

01:01:33.774 --> 01:01:35.443
How much does she know?

01:01:36.527 --> 01:01:37.987
She wants to see him.

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:44.452
You take him down, and we go.

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:06.682
Look, you do it, and we leave, right?

01:02:12.313 --> 01:02:14.315
Tell me you're not gonna stay here.

01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:18.945
No!

01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:17.712
Of course, you're still here.

01:03:22.425 --> 01:03:25.344
I gave him your name, where you live.
Perhaps he'll come.

01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:33.644
But if you say anything to anyone,
he'll come for sure,

01:03:33.728 --> 01:03:35.438
but not in the way that you want.

01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:41.736
Because he'll do things to you
that you can't even imagine.

01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:47.491
Get out of here.

01:04:39.752 --> 01:04:41.295
Julia!

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.089
Bitch! Open up!

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.340
Shut up and let me do the talking!

01:04:44.423 --> 01:04:46.842
Julia! Open the God damned door!

01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:48.636
We're not going to break through.

01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:50.096
Okay, the cops are coming.

01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:51.639
You're dead, bitch!

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.058
You'll be dealing
with them, you understand?

01:04:54.141 --> 01:04:55.643
Open up the door!

01:04:56.811 --> 01:04:59.688
Everything's going to be fine.
Now, you just come out.

01:04:59.814 --> 01:05:01.857
The bitch is
frightened to come outside!

01:05:03.234 --> 01:05:04.944
Check the back door!

01:05:04.985 --> 01:05:07.029
Everyone around, we're gonna haul Julia out!

01:05:07.113 --> 01:05:08.406
MAN 21 Julia!

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:19.119
Come down, you bitch!

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:26.460
Are you all right?

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:27.795
For God's sake, Campbell!

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:29.129
I told you to keep her away from the window.

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:30.965
- Sorry, Sheriff.
- Get her away from the damn window.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:32.299
They want to tear her apart.

01:07:32.383 --> 01:07:33.425
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:35.469
Lieutenant, there's too many.

01:07:37.263 --> 01:07:38.639
We're not waiting.

01:07:39.807 --> 01:07:41.725
Just keep your look straight ahead.

01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:43.435
Deputy, you're on the right.

01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:44.937
- And when we get out that door...
- In here.

01:07:44.979 --> 01:07:46.981
I want you to head straight for that...

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:52.236
Shit!

01:07:52.528 --> 01:07:53.988
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:55.489 --> 01:07:58.200
Keep your head down.
Look at the ground in front of you.

01:07:58.284 --> 01:08:01.829
Do not engage.
We're headed straight for the car.

01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:03.914
Don't say a word. Don't talk back.

01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:04.999
Look straight down. Come on, let's go!

01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:08.335
You're gonna die!

01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:14.508
You killed my baby!

01:08:21.348 --> 01:08:23.850
You took my baby!

01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:27.187
Let's go. Go, go, go, 90!

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:49.585
Keep your
head down, Mrs. Denning.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:50.919
Down!

01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:54.006
Is team number one
on the second floor?

01:09:20.658 --> 01:09:23.993
Well, nice little workshop.

01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:31.710
Hey.

01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:46.475
A well shaft.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.810
Oh, mercy.

01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:57.653
Did you know this house
was built over this shaft?

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.280
There's holes everywhere here.

01:10:00.322 --> 01:10:02.700
More than 40 square miles of them.

01:10:02.783 --> 01:10:04.576
It's going to be a pain in the ass.

01:10:04.618 --> 01:10:06.537
Too bad for us, Chestnut.

01:10:07.079 --> 01:10:09.498
Whole region's
sitting on this same Swiss cheese.

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:10.749
Uh-huh.

01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:15.921
Well, if the children are down here,

01:10:16.588 --> 01:10:21.927
it could take us 100 men and 20 years
to find them, if they're down here.

01:10:21.969 --> 01:10:25.973
Who's to say she didn't
use this as a passageway out into the woods?

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:32.104
Nah, we're going to need everybody.
Get them outside.

01:10:32.146 --> 01:10:33.731
Going to need lights.

01:10:57.004 --> 01:10:59.047
- Not a single thing.
- Well, what do we do?

01:10:59.548 --> 01:11:02.009
Police line. No one goes in or out!

01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:32.956
How are you, Mrs. Denning?

01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:38.462
We haven't found him.

01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:40.881
Not him, not the others.

01:11:45.469 --> 01:11:46.887
Don't tell me.

01:11:49.056 --> 01:11:51.934
Don't tell me that's
what I'll have to tell the parents.

01:12:05.948 --> 01:12:07.616
Naw, keep going-

01:12:07.699 --> 01:12:09.743
You got this covered?

01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:13.956
Now,

01:12:14.957 --> 01:12:17.000
I'm given to understand that your husband

01:12:17.084 --> 01:12:20.420
was a well-respected man
around here, Mrs. Denning.

01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:24.424
Yes, he was.

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:30.013
Now, there was a large age difference
between you, isn't that right?

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:37.271
- Yes.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:40.858
He was a doctor in Cold Rock

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:43.902
from 1992 until when?

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:51.285
Until the end.

01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:56.123
His... His end.

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:02.337
And how would you describe
his relationship to the people around here?

01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:06.592
He kept this community together.

01:13:08.552 --> 01:13:10.596
Cold Rock was dignified then.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.976
He helped to create that dignity.

01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:19.605
Yes.

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:23.317
And then, the mine shut down...

01:13:23.984 --> 01:13:27.404
And morale declined.

01:13:29.031 --> 01:13:32.492
And he was gone
when the children were paying the price.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:35.287
The children?

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:37.706
They were suffering so much.

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:41.627
I had to do something.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.672
Could you explain that for me, Mrs. Denning?

01:13:48.008 --> 01:13:51.261
Did you keep them in a room,
one after the other?

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:57.142
In a real children's room with books

01:13:58.185 --> 01:13:59.853
and toys, and music.

01:13:59.895 --> 01:14:02.022
It's filled with beautiful things.

01:14:04.983 --> 01:14:06.568
And Christine.

01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:10.155
She looked after the children
when you were away?

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:14.618
Yes.

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:18.413
But apparently, you told David's mother

01:14:18.705 --> 01:14:21.083
that you delivered the children
to someone you called

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.709
the Tall Man.

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:27.255
All of Cold Rock chose that name.

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:31.885
Mrs. Denning, is there a man,
whatever his name,

01:14:32.052 --> 01:14:34.179
to whom you delivered the children?

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.812
No.

01:14:43.981 --> 01:14:45.190
You acted alone?

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:47.693
Yes.

01:14:50.946 --> 01:14:53.407
Now, you yourself, Mrs. Denning,

01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:56.243
you were never able to
bear children, were you?

01:14:59.121 --> 01:15:01.123
We couldn't have children.

01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:11.216
<i>Mrs. Denning,</i>

01:15:12.426 --> 01:15:15.595
<i>did you kidnap</i>
<i>the children of Pittsville County?</i>

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:24.563
<i>Yes.</i>

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:27.816
<i>Did you make those children disappear?</i>

01:15:32.696 --> 01:15:33.989
Mrs. Denning,

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:36.616
are those children dead?

01:15:43.123 --> 01:15:44.541
Did you kill them?

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.965
Did you kill them, Mrs. Denning?

01:15:57.471 --> 01:15:58.930
Mrs. Denning?

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:12.486
<i>Cold ROCK, USA,</i>

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.780
<i>Pittsville County,</i>

01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:17.199
<i>Washington State.</i>

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:20.660
<i>Shut down mine,</i>

01:16:21.328 --> 01:16:25.999
<i>no school, miles of forest</i>
<i>and a labyrinth of tunnels.</i>

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:32.005
<i>Possibly the worst place ever to</i>
<i>search for traces of 18 missing children.</i>

01:16:33.173 --> 01:16:37.094
<i>Last victim's name, David Johnson.</i>

01:17:14.965 --> 01:17:16.299
Well...

01:17:16.383 --> 01:17:18.468
How are you managing, Mrs. Johnson?

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:21.555
- I'm holding on.
- Good.

01:17:22.222 --> 01:17:24.057
Okay, you want to come in?

01:17:25.016 --> 01:17:26.309
Have a seat.

01:17:27.394 --> 01:17:28.728
We need you

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:30.564
to avoid confrontation.

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:33.650
We need you to appeal to her as a mother.

01:17:34.067 --> 01:17:35.402
Do you understand?

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:37.487
I understand.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:43.034
Now, if any single remark or question
shuts her down, we get nothing.

01:17:43.535 --> 01:17:45.912
We have found no trace of the kids,

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:47.873
and she doesn't talk to us anymore.

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:51.501
Mrs. Johnson,

01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:58.091
if you feel that you cannot go through with
this right now, you need to let me know.

01:17:59.926 --> 01:18:01.428
No, I'm ready.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.600
Try not to focus on anything too specific.

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:08.977
You just talk to her, you listen to her.

01:18:09.477 --> 01:18:11.438
You try to get her to open up.

01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:14.774
If we get anything,
it will be because she didn't realize it.

01:18:15.192 --> 01:18:16.443
You understand?

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:18.672
<i>I know why you're here.</i>

01:19:21.258 --> 01:19:23.176
<i>You want answers.</i>

01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:25.178
<i>Yes.</i>

01:19:27.681 --> 01:19:31.226
<i>But there's nothing I can say</i>
<i>that's going to give you any comfort.</i>

01:19:33.186 --> 01:19:34.604
<i>Julia,</i>

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:38.191
<i>I can't live.</i>

01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:42.362
<i>I keep turning things around in my mind,</i>

01:19:43.238 --> 01:19:44.948
and I miss him, you know.

01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:50.245
It's unbearable, the missing him.

01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:55.041
<i>Thinking about him all the time,</i>
<i>wondering where he is.</i>

01:19:57.711 --> 01:19:58.920
<i>I know.</i>

01:19:59.254 --> 01:20:01.131
I don't think you do, Julia.

01:20:02.716 --> 01:20:04.551
But I do know.

01:20:05.218 --> 01:20:07.887
I was a mother to each and every one of them.

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:13.143
<i>They had everything</i>
<i>they could ever possibly need.</i>

01:20:17.522 --> 01:20:20.025
<i>Julia, I know I live in a dump</i>
<i>J</i>

01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:22.027
<i>I don't have a job, and life for me is hard,</i>

01:20:22.068 --> 01:20:23.945
<i>but I would still die for him, you know?</i>

01:20:27.407 --> 01:20:29.826
<i>It's just the same everywhere.</i>

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:34.331
<i>The defeat</i>

01:20:34.748 --> 01:20:36.249
and the pain,

01:20:37.292 --> 01:20:38.585
it's a cycle.

01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:41.588
<i>A Cycle?</i>

01:20:43.757 --> 01:20:45.633
<i>You shouldn't have come here.</i>

01:21:01.066 --> 01:21:02.776
<i>What cycle?</i>

01:21:06.905 --> 01:21:08.448
<i>The system is broken.</i>

01:21:09.949 --> 01:21:11.493
<i>It doesn't work.</i>

01:21:13.328 --> 01:21:15.622
<i>There's nowhere to turn. There's no support.</i>

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:19.209
<i>I've seen it all over the world.</i>

01:21:19.292 --> 01:21:20.960
<i>It's just easier to give up.</i>

01:21:23.171 --> 01:21:29.010
I'm not any better than you, Mrs. Johnson
I've just seen more.

01:21:30.053 --> 01:21:33.348
<i>It's not a matter of being a good person</i>
<i>or being a bad person.</i>

01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:35.058
<i>It's about how you cope.</i>

01:21:36.267 --> 01:21:37.894
We're so limited.

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:46.778
<i>But the eyes of every child</i>
<i>are filled with potential and hope,</i>

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:50.949
<i>and we should embrace</i>
<i>and nourish that potential, but we don't.</i>

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:52.992
<i>We continue to make the same mistakes.</i>

01:21:53.076 --> 01:21:56.496
<i>We continue to let</i>
<i>the children grow up broken and lost,</i>

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.164
<i>just like their parents.</i>

01:21:58.248 --> 01:21:59.874
<i>We have to break the cycle.</i>

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.460
<i>It has to be a priority, but it's not.</i>

01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:06.005
<i>That's what I've been trying to do.</i>
<i>That's what I've done everywhere.</i>

01:22:06.047 --> 01:22:07.841
<i>And what did I change?</i>

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:08.925
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:22:10.218 --> 01:22:13.304
<i>Yes, I cared, I helped, I cuddled,</i>

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:17.684
<i>thinking I was bringing change,</i>
<i>thinking I was making a difference,</i>

01:22:17.725 --> 01:22:20.103
<i>but when we asked for real change,</i>

01:22:20.186 --> 01:22:22.730
<i>all these bureaucrats said,</i>
<i>"No, you can't do that.</i>

01:22:22.814 --> 01:22:24.023
<i>"There's a process."</i>

01:22:24.107 --> 01:22:26.526
<i>Every time we questioned the politicians,</i>

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:30.697
<i>and the system that makes</i>
<i>poor people poorer, and the children suffer,</i>

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.074
<i>they said,</i>
<i>"No, you can't do that. There's a process."</i>

01:22:33.158 --> 01:22:37.245
<i>So the cycle goes on,</i>
<i>and goes on and goes on,</i>

01:22:37.328 --> 01:22:39.122
<i>and the children continue to suffer,</i>

01:22:39.205 --> 01:22:42.834
<i>and no one does anything about it,</i>
<i>and the world will never change.</i>

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:48.006
God, I'm just torturing you.

01:22:57.765 --> 01:23:00.393
If you're done,

01:23:01.728 --> 01:23:04.189
<i>can you answer two simple questions?</i>

01:23:07.233 --> 01:23:10.320
<i>The parents of Cold Rock need to know,</i>

01:23:12.947 --> 01:23:15.074
<i>are the children dead?</i>

01:23:24.918 --> 01:23:26.294
No.

01:23:31.174 --> 01:23:33.218
<i>I couldn't keep them all.</i>

01:23:37.138 --> 01:23:38.681
<i>Where are they?</i>

01:23:39.516 --> 01:23:40.975
They're in the forest,

01:23:42.769 --> 01:23:44.437
in the tunnels,

01:23:47.482 --> 01:23:48.691
<i>everywhere.</i>

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.498
Hello, baby killer. That's right.

01:24:47.792 --> 01:24:49.377
I'll kill you, bitch!

01:24:50.795 --> 01:24:52.422
You're mine, bitch!

01:25:15.945 --> 01:25:18.364
Read my lips, honey.

01:25:18.448 --> 01:25:19.866
I'm not bringing her back!

01:25:19.907 --> 01:25:22.702
Neither you
or your fucking sister has no say!

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:24.621
- Okay?
- No.

01:25:25.371 --> 01:25:26.664
What do you mean, no?

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:28.082
No, my sister and I agreed.

01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:30.877
I don't care what
your fucking sister said!

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.337
Carol needs to come back!

01:25:32.378 --> 01:25:34.631
Steven, you bring your voice down.
You're going to wake Jenny!

01:25:34.714 --> 01:25:36.466
I'm not going to bring my fucking voice down!

01:25:36.549 --> 01:25:39.844
Oh, you are drunk!
We are going to talk about this tomorrow.

01:25:39.886 --> 01:25:43.097
No! No, we're not going to talk tomorrow.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.393
You are going to call your fucking sister!
Carol is going to come back!

01:25:47.435 --> 01:25:49.395
Oh, is that what you want?
You want to talk tough?

01:25:49.437 --> 01:25:54.609
You want me to get tough? Huh?
You really want tough?

01:25:54.692 --> 01:25:56.861
You don't know when to

01:25:56.903 --> 01:25:58.905
- God damn shut your mouth!
- Mom! Dad!

01:25:59.906 --> 01:26:00.907
Get off!

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:02.408
You want to get hit?

01:26:05.536 --> 01:26:07.372
Oh, baby, baby.

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:11.584
Get off me, you little runt.

01:26:18.925 --> 01:26:20.093
Son of a bitch!

01:26:20.927 --> 01:26:23.388
Baby, baby. Come here. Come here.

01:26:36.067 --> 01:26:37.318
Don't you touch her!

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:39.946
Don't you ever touch her!

01:26:42.949 --> 01:26:45.618
You didn't miss me this time, honey.

01:26:45.785 --> 01:26:48.121
Nice shot.

01:26:48.746 --> 01:26:51.457
You bastard.

01:27:20.194 --> 01:27:22.613
You want to play rough?
I'll get rough.

01:27:22.655 --> 01:27:24.991
- Don't you push me.
- Then do it, do it.

01:27:29.412 --> 01:27:31.414
Don't ever
lay a hand on the kid again.

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:33.833
Don't you ever strike my daughter!

01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:36.794
The kid overreacts!

01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:55.021
Jenny!

01:27:55.188 --> 01:27:57.440
Jenny, where are you, honey?

01:28:00.693 --> 01:28:03.529
Come back, everything's okay. I'm okay.

01:32:42.016 --> 01:32:44.643
I'm probably not what you were dreaming of,

01:32:45.603 --> 01:32:47.480
but you're not a baby yourself, dear.

01:32:49.982 --> 01:32:51.984
Can you wait here for a moment?

01:33:00.826 --> 01:33:03.370
Yes, I think it Will be all right.

01:33:03.662 --> 01:33:05.164
It has to be.

01:33:06.165 --> 01:33:08.918
As far as we are concerned,
Jenny Weaver is dead.

01:33:09.418 --> 01:33:11.837
Please meet Vera Parker-Leigh.

01:33:13.964 --> 01:33:15.716
Watch over her carefully.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.803
Our field officer was unable
to give her a proper transition.

01:33:18.844 --> 01:33:21.430
Be extremely careful the first few weeks.

01:33:21.514 --> 01:33:24.433
Her behavior could still
be deemed suspicious and give us away.

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:32.233
- No, ma'am.
- Please, I insist.

01:33:35.069 --> 01:33:37.530
I don't want your money.

01:33:40.658 --> 01:33:43.327
The women who saved this girl
paid a high price.

01:33:43.869 --> 01:33:48.332
One of them is dead, and the other will
never again see the light of day.

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:51.001
I know. I saw her on the news.

01:33:51.544 --> 01:33:53.546
Your money is an insult to her sacrifice.

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:57.091
Will Jenny be
the last one being taken care of?

01:33:57.174 --> 01:33:58.884
The last one from that division.

01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:01.554
Mrs. Parker-Leigh.

01:34:02.847 --> 01:34:04.557
So, there are more of you?

01:35:29.975 --> 01:35:31.477
How are you, Tracy?

01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:34.313
I wasn't expecting you.

01:35:38.442 --> 01:35:40.486
We haven't found Jenny yet.

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.115
I guess Chestnut's doing what he can, right?

01:35:45.449 --> 01:35:46.450
Uh...

01:35:47.493 --> 01:35:49.495
I put one of my men on the case.

01:35:49.578 --> 01:35:50.829
Thanks.

01:35:52.456 --> 01:35:53.874
What about Julia?

01:35:54.667 --> 01:35:59.088
Well, the prosecution's asking
for the death penalty this afternoon,

01:35:59.171 --> 01:36:01.715
but I don't think they're going to grant it.

01:36:03.509 --> 01:36:06.595
In case she decides to tell them
where the other kids are buried.

01:36:08.305 --> 01:36:10.432
We know that she's not the one
that took my Jenny.

01:36:11.392 --> 01:36:13.477
Your Jenny ran away,

01:36:13.978 --> 01:36:15.646
and I'm going to find her.

01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:18.357
Okay.

01:36:20.025 --> 01:36:21.777
Hang in there, Tracy.

01:36:22.695 --> 01:36:24.613
Yeah, I've been doing that for 25 years.

01:36:25.698 --> 01:36:28.242
Yeah, I hear ya.

01:36:57.313 --> 01:37:00.190
<i>My first mother was a good woman.</i>

01:37:00.232 --> 01:37:04.403
<i>Hardworking, generous, affectionate.</i>

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:09.533
<i>We talked, we shared, we laughed,</i>

01:37:11.076 --> 01:37:12.703
<i>but then it stopped.</i>

01:37:13.245 --> 01:37:17.499
<i>She couldn't talk to us anymore about men,</i>

01:37:17.583 --> 01:37:20.961
<i>about her dreams, about her pain.</i>

01:37:21.879 --> 01:37:25.716
<i>My first mother loved me,</i>
<i>and I loved my first mother.</i>

01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:30.054
Watch your back.

01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:33.349
INMATE 21 You're mine!

01:37:33.766 --> 01:37:36.769
<i>My second mother only</i>
<i>mothered me for a short time.</i>

01:37:36.852 --> 01:37:38.312
You're dead, you rat!

01:37:38.395 --> 01:37:40.522
<i>I often think about her.</i>

01:37:41.398 --> 01:37:45.277
<i>I try to imagine the moment</i>
<i>she had in the tunnel,</i>

01:37:45.361 --> 01:37:47.946
<i>giving one last kid to her husband.</i>

01:37:48.322 --> 01:37:49.782
Bitch! You're dead.

01:37:49.823 --> 01:37:52.284
<i>Did he implore her</i>
<i>to run away with him?</i>

01:37:52.451 --> 01:37:55.788
<i>Or did they both know someone had to stay,</i>

01:37:55.829 --> 01:38:00.793
<i>be the monster, pay the price,</i>
<i>and protect their secret?</i>

01:38:02.836 --> 01:38:07.466
<i>Whether she was a good person or not,</i>
<i>I'm still not sure,</i>

01:38:07.508 --> 01:38:12.096
<i>but my second mother loved me,</i>
<i>and I loved my second mother.</i>

01:38:19.186 --> 01:38:22.564
<i>My third mother is</i>
<i>teaching me about the bigger world.</i>

01:38:23.482 --> 01:38:28.946
<i>She says knowledge is the key</i>
<i>to open all my doors, so I stay focused.</i>

01:38:29.488 --> 01:38:32.366
<i>I observe, and I work hard.</i>

01:38:32.699 --> 01:38:34.159
Vera, sweetheart.

01:38:34.243 --> 01:38:36.328
<i>I listen to what she says</i>

01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:37.996
<i>I want to please her.</i>

01:38:38.247 --> 01:38:42.501
<i>My third mother loves me,</i>
<i>and I love my third mother.</i>

01:38:42.543 --> 01:38:44.628
You're going to be late for art class.

01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:46.296
I'll be right there.

01:38:58.267 --> 01:39:00.519
<i>My world has changed.</i>

01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:03.605
<i>I try to follow its rules.</i>

01:39:04.898 --> 01:39:07.484
<i>It's a beautiful world, my new mother says.</i>

01:39:09.069 --> 01:39:12.865
<i>She tells me to hang on, that I'm doing well,</i>

01:39:14.408 --> 01:39:16.201
<i>that I'll get used to it with time.</i>

01:39:21.665 --> 01:39:23.041
Jeffrey.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.419
Jeffrey, come on.

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.465
Come on, honey.

01:39:30.007 --> 01:39:31.216
We're going to be late.

01:39:33.218 --> 01:39:35.554
<i>I'm not like the others.</i>

01:39:36.555 --> 01:39:38.390
<i>I guess they've forgotten.</i>

01:39:40.434 --> 01:39:41.810
<i>I can't</i>

01:39:48.775 --> 01:39:51.236
<i>Every morning,</i>
<i>I wake up to the same thought of</i>

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.655
<i>giving it all up and running back home,</i>

01:39:54.364 --> 01:39:57.409
<i>but I remind myself I wanted this life.</i>

01:39:58.076 --> 01:40:01.079
<i>I wanted it. I made it happen.</i>

01:40:03.624 --> 01:40:06.001
<i>I guess it's better this way, right?</i>

01:40:07.586 --> 01:40:08.754
<i>Right?</i>

01:40:10.714 --> 01:40:11.882
<i>Right?</i>
