WEBVTT

00:09.042 --> 00:10.532
What's got Daphne all worked up now?

00:11.211 --> 00:12.479
It wasn't Daphne.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.014
It was Maris.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.248
She's gotten involved

00:15.248 --> 00:17.250
with some Argentine polo player.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.047
It turns out he's a gold digger

00:19.219 --> 00:21.050
with a violent temper to boot.

00:21.254 --> 00:22.355
Dr. Crane? Yes?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.050
I'm Esteban di Rojo.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.061
I tell you, Maris will
never come between us again.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.362
MAN: And now, news headlines.

00:29.362 --> 00:33.033
Police have just arrested
Seattle socialite Maris Crane

00:33.033 --> 00:36.730
for the murder of her lover,
polo star Esteban di Rojo.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.140
Oh, come in.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.630
Niles. What have you heard?

00:42.108 --> 00:43.598
Not much. The TV news
is still pretty sketchy.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.111
Dad, did you find anything out?

00:45.111 --> 00:47.113
I called some buddies at the station.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.114
They'll call back when
they know something.

00:48.114 --> 00:50.116
DAPHNE: It's just so freaky.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.618
I can't believe that man is dead.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.609
He was standing right where
you are just a few hours ago.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.121
How you holding up, son?

00:55.121 --> 00:57.624
As well as can be expected.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.626
I meant your brother.

00:59.626 --> 01:02.128
Oh, well, I'm-I'm stunned, of course.

01:02.128 --> 01:05.632
The idea that-that Maris
actually killed someone...

01:05.632 --> 01:08.624
Well, we've all seen her murder
many a lively dinner party.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.570
That's terrible. Frasier.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.572
Oh, come on. I'm joking,

01:12.572 --> 01:14.563
and haven't I earned a
right to my gallows humor?

01:15.275 --> 01:17.277
After all, are you forgetting
that just this afternoon

01:17.277 --> 01:21.145
I was punched in the
face by a man now dead?

01:23.450 --> 01:24.678
Thank you.

01:25.118 --> 01:25.482
Here, drink this.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.187
Oh, thanks.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.189
(phone ringing)

01:29.189 --> 01:30.178
NILES: Hello.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.492
This is he.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.494
Yes, of course.

01:34.494 --> 01:37.197
Uh, I'll be there shortly.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.465
It's the police.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.200
They want to talk to me.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.201
My God, why? They don't suspect you

01:41.201 --> 01:42.502
of anything, do they?

01:42.502 --> 01:43.503
I don't think so.

01:43.503 --> 01:44.504
I don't think they could.

01:44.504 --> 01:46.206
They couldn't, could
they? Dad ? . Calm down.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.507
You had lunch with her today.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.142
They just want to know
what you talked about.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.443
What did we talk about?
What did we talk about?

01:50.443 --> 01:52.206
Uh, let's see. Well...

01:52.445 --> 01:54.504
We-we discussed the upcoming
women's arts festival

01:55.215 --> 01:56.204
and their tableaux vivant.

01:56.516 --> 01:59.212
They're going to be re-enactin
Schmitt's painting of

01:59.519 --> 02:02.215
"The Martyrdom of St.
Ursula by Attila the Hun. "

02:02.522 --> 02:05.225
Naturally, Maris will pose as the Hun.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.419
Ah.

02:06.693 --> 02:07.794
A tad dramatic for my taste,

02:07.794 --> 02:09.795
but nonetheless, I told her I'd help out

02:09.795 --> 02:11.297
by lending her my antique crossbow

02:11.297 --> 02:13.231
to help complete the
tragic scene on the Rhone.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.701
Of course, talk of the Rhone

02:14.701 --> 02:16.669
inevitably led to
that wonderful anecdote

02:17.170 --> 02:19.672
about the Nazarene painters
of Biddlespock Palace.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.674
(guffaws) : Those beer-loving rascals.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.176
Tell it, Niles.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.165
No!

02:26.179 --> 02:28.170
What did she say about the polo guy?

02:28.548 --> 02:30.350
Well, I-I told you,
she-she mentioned

02:30.350 --> 02:31.351
she felt unsafe around him

02:31.351 --> 02:33.353
and that she thought he only wanted her

02:33.353 --> 02:35.622
for her money, and I urged
her to end the relationship.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.624
 Well, that's pretty tame stuff

02:37.624 --> 02:39.319
It'll take more than a little lunch

02:39.626 --> 02:41.227
to tie you into a murder.

02:41.227 --> 02:44.631
Oh, dear. Niles, they're in
front of Maris' house now.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.467
...startling new development
in the society murder case.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.836
Sources say alleged murderer

02:49.836 --> 02:53.239
Maris Crane killed her polo
- playing lover, Esteban di Rojo,

02:53.239 --> 02:54.638
with an antique crossbow.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.217
You gave her the murder weapon.

03:04.217 --> 03:07.209
(telephone ringing)

03:11.224 --> 03:12.725
Hello?

03:12.725 --> 03:14.227
It's a reporter.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.728
I'm not here.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.230
 I'm sorry, he's not here

03:17.230 --> 03:20.233
and I don't know when he's coming back.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.403
I'd rather not say.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.538
I'd rather not say!

03:25.538 --> 03:28.241
Oh, thank you. Manchester, actually.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.230
Hang up.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.410
Good-bye.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.678
NILES: I don't believe this.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.446
It's an unlisted number.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.448
They must think I'm involved somehow.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.450
Th-they're actually
trying to imply that...

03:37.450 --> 03:39.953
(gasping)

03:39.953 --> 03:42.956
No, no, no, I'm not going to panic.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.356
The only way to get through
this is to remain calm.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.584
Right. Now, let's go
on down to the station

03:48.294 --> 03:49.596
and get this all sorted out.

03:49.596 --> 03:50.597
I'm coming, too.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.298
No. You have to rest up

03:52.298 --> 03:54.300
for our doctor's
appointment tomorrow morning.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.289
I'll stay with Daphne.

03:55.602 --> 03:56.603
NILES: Don't worry.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.305
Everything is going to be fine.

03:59.305 --> 04:01.296
(telephone ringing)

04:05.612 --> 04:07.247
You know, that's going
to go on all night.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.236
You want to just stay at my place?

04:08.414 --> 04:10.984
Thanks, but if I let them
drive me out of me own home,

04:10.984 --> 04:11.985
then they've won.

04:11.985 --> 04:12.986
(phone ringing)

04:12.986 --> 04:15.488
Allow me.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.890
Hello?

04:17.890 --> 04:19.791
I see.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.461
Yes, I'll tell her.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.326
Your mother heard the
news. She's on her way over.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:33.273 --> 04:34.440
Well, we survived.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.942
The kid held up.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.443
What took you all night?

04:37.443 --> 04:38.945
Oh, there was a lot of waiting.

04:38.945 --> 04:39.946
Here, let me take your jacket.

04:39.946 --> 04:40.935
Thank you.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.450
Fortunately, we found
a nice, cold metal bench

04:44.450 --> 04:46.452
between two drunk bikers

04:46.452 --> 04:49.444
and a pimp who called me Peaches.

04:49.889 --> 04:50.957
Yeah, and the interesting thing

04:50.957 --> 04:52.458
happened when we were leaving.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.449
We ran into Maris'
lawyer on the way out.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.462
And he told us the whole story.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.965
Apparently Maris and
Esteban had a fight,

04:58.965 --> 05:00.466
and Maris kicked him out.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.969
She was trying to calm
herself by practicing

05:02.969 --> 05:04.470
her tableaux vivant pose

05:04.470 --> 05:05.972
with the... with the crossbow,

05:05.972 --> 05:07.974
which she needs all the
practice she can get.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.475
She has terribly weak triceps.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.979
Well, all of a sudden,
Esteban burst back in

05:12.979 --> 05:15.481
through the balcony window.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.483
Maris was-was startled to death

05:17.483 --> 05:19.485
and pulled the trigger in self-defense.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.976
He was dead before he hit the parquet.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.048
So where is she now?

05:25.525 --> 05:27.015
They're holding her as a flight risk.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.528
Can you imagine?

05:28.528 --> 05:30.996
Well, it didn't help
that when they found her

05:31.497 --> 05:33.466
she had a passport, a wig
and $ 10, 000 in her purse.

05:33.466 --> 05:37.036
Maris always has those
things in her purse.

05:37.036 --> 05:39.038
Well, you've got to admit, Niles,

05:39.038 --> 05:40.471
it doesn't look very good.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.098
I can't believe she
could have planned this.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.098
You do learn something about a woman

05:44.610 --> 05:46.601
when you've slept in the room
next to hers for 1 5 years.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.616
(thump)

05:50.616 --> 05:52.385
Oh, that must be the paper.

05:52.385 --> 05:53.545
So she just happened

05:53.953 --> 05:55.521
to be posing with a loaded crossbow

05:55.521 --> 05:57.523
the exact moment he burst in on her?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.525
And don't you just know the prosecutor

05:59.525 --> 06:01.928
is going to try to twist
that into something sinister?

06:01.928 --> 06:04.430
FRASIER: Oh, dear.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.419
It's on the front page.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.867
They don't mention Niles, do they?

06:07.867 --> 06:08.868
Let me see...

06:08.868 --> 06:09.732
Ah, here we are, yes, uh,

06:10.136 --> 06:11.404
"Maris Crane is believed

06:11.404 --> 06:13.406
"to have gotten the
crossbow from her ex-husband,

06:13.406 --> 06:14.707
"Dr. Niles Crane, with whom she lunched

06:14.707 --> 06:16.937
on the day of the murder. "

06:17.176 --> 06:19.445
Is that you and Maris on your honeymoon?

06:19.445 --> 06:23.750
Uh, that is the experimental
liposuction center in Gestaad.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.445
So, yes.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.555
"According to sources,
Crane divorced the accused

06:29.555 --> 06:31.546
"some years ago to
marry her plastic surgeon

06:32.058 --> 06:36.051
"whom he left in order
to marry... " Oh, dear.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.566
"To marry Daphne Moon, a housekeeper. "

06:40.566 --> 06:42.068
Oh, that's just lovely.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.069
Now, now, now, now.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.571
The press is notorious
for getting things wrong.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.073
(chuckling) : Yes. Niles is right.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.574
For-for example, look.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.077
Further on here, it-it says, (chuckles)

06:51.077 --> 06:54.080
"Dr. Crane is the brother
of local deejay Frazer--

06:54.080 --> 06:55.515
with a 'Z'--
Crane. "

06:55.515 --> 06:58.084
You just have to laugh these things off.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.952
(laughing)

06:59.952 --> 07:01.621
Well, I can't laugh.

07:01.621 --> 07:02.610
That horrible woman has managed

07:02.922 --> 07:04.924
to slither her way back into our lives.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.626
No, she is not back in our life.

07:06.626 --> 07:07.923
This whole thing is going
to blow over in no time.

07:08.628 --> 07:09.629
How can you be so calm?

07:09.629 --> 07:11.664
Well, in situations such as this,

07:11.664 --> 07:12.653
there are only two ways to react.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.634
Either you go to
pieces or you stay calm,

07:14.634 --> 07:16.202
and I've chosen to do the latter.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.794
Bravo, Niles. That's very healthy.

07:18.504 --> 07:19.806
Yeah. Well, better go home, son.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.501
Get some sleep. You've had a long night.

07:21.741 --> 07:22.537
That is a good idea.

07:22.809 --> 07:23.503
 I'll call you later.

07:23.810 --> 07:24.811
All right. Thank you.

07:24.811 --> 07:28.514
Oh. We have your doctor'
s appointment this morning.

07:28.514 --> 07:29.674
Oh, don't worry, you don't have to come.

07:30.049 --> 07:32.118
Oh? And miss hearing
my baby's heartbeat?

07:32.118 --> 07:33.119
I don't think so.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.620
Besides, I'll be fine.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.611
Plenty of time to sleep
after the baby's born.

07:43.729 --> 07:44.664
ROZ: How you holding up?

07:44.664 --> 07:47.133
Apart from the lack of
sleep, I'm all right,

07:47.133 --> 07:49.135
although, now that it's in the news

07:49.135 --> 07:51.137
that I provided the
crossbow, I can't go anywhere

07:51.137 --> 07:53.128
without people whispering and pointing.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.640
(phone ringing)

07:54.640 --> 07:56.130
Oh, excuse me.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.644
Hello?

07:58.644 --> 07:59.633
Hello, Maris.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.015
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry.

08:03.015 --> 08:04.517
Yes, that's awful.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.019
can. I'll-I'll-I'll
do what I

08:07.019 --> 08:08.020
Yes, all right.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.022
Oh, that was Maris.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.513
Poor thing lost her shoes.

08:14.527 --> 08:19.031
She put them outside her
cell to be polished, and...

08:19.031 --> 08:22.023
someone named Big Judy is
holding them for ransom.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.036
FRASIER: Well, I...

08:24.036 --> 08:26.038
how often does she call you?

08:26.038 --> 08:28.040
Uh, more often than
you'd think she could,

08:28.040 --> 08:30.543
being in jail.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.544
Hasn't she made your life hard enough?

08:32.544 --> 08:34.547
Oh, I can't turn my
back on her now, Roz.

08:34.547 --> 08:36.549
She's literally fighting for her life.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.039
Oh, wonderful.

08:38.551 --> 08:39.552
More news vans.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.543
Maybe it's time I made a statement.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.043
Absolutely not, Niles.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.057
That is the worst possible
thing you could do.

08:45.057 --> 08:47.548
It would only fan the
flames. I'll tell you what.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.562
, Why don't you slip out the back way

08:49.562 --> 08:51.063
and I will talk to them for you.

08:51.063 --> 08:53.065
 Oh, that's... there's no need, Frasier

08:53.065 --> 08:54.567
No, Niles, I insist.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.569
I'm used to dealing
with these media jackals.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.059
You have no idea how
they can twist your words

08:58.571 --> 09:00.072
with editing tricks and such. All right.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.073
Off you go.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.074
Thank you, Frasier.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.076
Is Niles Crane in here?

09:04.076 --> 09:05.077
He is not.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.579
I will be speaking on his behalf.

09:06.579 --> 09:08.570
Gentlemen, you may roll tape.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.087
Good afternoon, Seattle.

09:15.087 --> 09:18.955
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
spokesman for the Crane family.

09:19.158 --> 09:22.728
Recent events involving
my brother, Niles Crane,

09:22.728 --> 09:24.730
and his ex-wife are tragic...

09:24.730 --> 09:28.734
almost as tragic as the
rampant media speculation

09:28.734 --> 09:31.237
concerning his involvement.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.674
If there is any justice in the world,

09:34.674 --> 09:37.666
Maris Crane and Niles
Crane will soon be executed.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.667
Thank you. That is all I have to say.

09:42.682 --> 09:43.683
I said no such thing.

09:43.683 --> 09:44.684
I did? I did?

09:44.684 --> 09:46.675
Excuse me. Excuse me. Come back.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.092
FRASIER (over TV): Maris
Crane and Niles Crane

09:53.092 --> 09:55.060
will soon be executed.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.921
That's four times in one newscast.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.732
Must be some kind of record.

09:59.732 --> 10:02.792
They know I meant exonerated. (groans)

10:03.903 --> 10:05.605
FRASIER: Oh, Daphne, Niles!

10:05.605 --> 10:09.609
Listen, I'm, I'm so sorry
about today's little gaffe

10:09.609 --> 10:10.876
You know what I meant.

10:10.876 --> 10:11.877
Oh, don't worry.

10:11.877 --> 10:12.878
Anyone can make a little slip.

10:12.878 --> 10:15.369
We know you were only
trying to ruin our lives.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.371
I mean, help.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.387
Niles, once again, I'm so sorry.

10:21.387 --> 10:22.888
No, no, Frasier, please, it's all right.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.290
I should have talked to them myself.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.780
I hope it'll be all right

10:26.092 --> 10:27.787
if we stay with you for a while.

10:28.094 --> 10:28.992
Why? What happened?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.863
Well, since Frasier's
little press conference,

10:30.863 --> 10:32.365
the media frenzy's only increased.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.367
It's become a nuisance
for our neighbors.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.870
TV crews and news helicopters,
plus the entire press corps

10:37.870 --> 10:40.873
from Esteban's hometown in Argentina.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.876
Last night some cheeky bloke
from the Buenos Aires Herald

10:43.876 --> 10:45.878
climbed a tree and took a picture

10:45.878 --> 10:47.869
of old Mrs Gotschalk in her sitz bath.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.784
Apparently, the readership of the Herald

10:51.784 --> 10:54.275
is mostly lonely gauchos.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.186
FRASIER: You know, Niles,

10:56.756 --> 10:58.824
your good cheer in spite of everything

10:58.824 --> 11:00.026
is just remarkable.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.194
Well, I've chosen not
to let it get to me,

11:02.194 --> 11:03.696
and it hasn't.

11:03.696 --> 11:05.698
Of course, much of the
credit goes to my Daphne.

11:05.698 --> 11:11.203
I-I'm so truly blessed to have
such a loving and supportive wife.

11:11.203 --> 11:14.707
She is at once my
huggle-bunny and my rock.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.209
I think I might throw up.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.211
Huggle-bunny was a bit much.

11:19.211 --> 11:21.080
No, no, my stomach, it's upset.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.415
Well, Daphne, can I get you something?

11:22.415 --> 11:23.416
Oh, thank you, Frasier.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.418
I wouldn't mind ten years in prison.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.908
Oh, I meant crackers.

11:34.427 --> 11:38.964
Well, I-I guess I deserve
that, but, uh, may I remind you,

11:38.964 --> 11:42.268
 I'm a bit of a victim myself..

11:42.268 --> 11:47.773
as just yesterday I was
punched in the face by a man...

11:47.773 --> 11:49.001
now dead.

11:51.310 --> 11:51.901
Thank you.

11:53.979 --> 11:55.037
(phone rings)

11:59.719 --> 12:00.481
Hello.

12:00.986 --> 12:03.477
Hello... Mmm.

12:05.991 --> 12:06.980
No, no, I haven't forgotten.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.929
Yes, I'll try to get
the re tomorrow morning.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.420
All right, good-bye, Mmm...

12:15.935 --> 12:17.937
That was Maris, wasn't it?

12:17.937 --> 12:19.302
Where will you be tomorrow morning?

12:21.107 --> 12:23.803
The jail. I-I-I said
I'd try to visit her.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.045
Have you lost your bloody mind?!

12:26.045 --> 12:27.813
I have tried to be patient,

12:27.813 --> 12:29.110
but this is too much!

12:29.815 --> 12:31.817
You promised me that woman
would be out of our lives.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.119
, Now she's calling every minute

12:33.119 --> 12:35.110
the papers report as though
you two are still married,

12:35.821 --> 12:37.823
and I can't even sleep in my own bed!

12:37.823 --> 12:39.125
I know, darling, b-but
you can't blame me

12:39.125 --> 12:40.359
for everything that's happened

12:40.359 --> 12:41.519
The hell I can't!

12:41.861 --> 12:43.886
If you hadn't snuck off
to have lunch with her,

12:43.929 --> 12:45.998
we never would have
been dragged into this,

12:45.998 --> 12:48.501
and you wouldn't be sleeping
alone on the couch tonight.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.366
But you did, and we were, so you are!

12:52.304 --> 12:53.794
I hate that kind of cracker!

12:57.843 --> 12:58.901
That was kind of harsh.

12:59.211 --> 13:00.007
FRASIER: I'll say.

13:00.379 --> 13:01.937
These are imported from Belgium.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.417
Poor thing.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.920
She's overtired and a little hormonal.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.412
I'll, I'll go try to talk
her into choosing to be calm.

13:13.425 --> 13:14.892
Boy, he's really holding up well.

13:15.194 --> 13:16.252
A little too well.

13:16.929 --> 13:17.930
I'm starting to fear

13:17.930 --> 13:19.932
he's not dealing with
his emotions at all.

13:19.932 --> 13:20.921
Right.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.936
That's the whole secret to holding up.

13:23.936 --> 13:27.940
Dad, it's called "repression
, "and it is not healthy.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.942
The man is a walking pressure cooker.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.239
It's his senior year

13:31.944 --> 13:32.933
all over again.

13:34.947 --> 13:35.936
What are you talking about?

13:36.248 --> 13:38.250
Oh, that's right.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.252
He swore me to secrecy.

13:40.252 --> 13:41.241
Well...

13:45.257 --> 13:46.959
Niles got mono.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.829
He missed four weeks of class, right?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.130
So, he was studying around the clock,

13:51.130 --> 13:52.825
trying to catch up.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.862
Just before finals, his
girlfriend dumped him

13:57.136 --> 13:58.037
for his roommate.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.972
Niles insisted he was just fine

13:59.972 --> 14:01.941
right up until the very moment

14:01.941 --> 14:03.475
when they found him in
the all-night grocery,

14:03.475 --> 14:05.978
sitting in a freezer bin,

14:05.978 --> 14:08.469
talking to a bag of frozen corn...

14:08.981 --> 14:12.974
whispering, "Why so cold, my love?"

14:16.021 --> 14:17.613
All calm.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.086
Want me to help you make up the couch?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.099
No, no. I can manage.

14:27.099 --> 14:30.091
 Okay. Well, I think
I'll hit the rack, too

14:31.604 --> 14:33.105
Sherry, Niles?

14:33.105 --> 14:34.607
Oh, how lovely.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.471
Thank you.

14:35.975 --> 14:36.339
Mmm.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.043
To the balcony?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.340
Mm, after you.

14:42.348 --> 14:47.353
Niles, while I admire
your initial fortitude,

14:47.353 --> 14:49.355
I can't help thinking
you may have taken things

14:49.355 --> 14:52.057
to extremes.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.060
As you know, it can be dangerous
to repress one's emotions.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.363
Ah, true, but there is no way

14:57.363 --> 14:59.064
of weathering a situation like this

14:59.064 --> 15:00.366
without a certain degree of detachment.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.167
Are you sure you're not too detached?

15:02.167 --> 15:03.168
Oh, nonsense.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.170
Everything's under control.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.171
Oh, look at that.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.674
What in the hell?!

15:08.674 --> 15:10.676
Just a news chopper!

15:10.676 --> 15:12.177
Pay it no mind!

15:12.177 --> 15:13.679
(shouting): That doesn't bother you?!

15:13.679 --> 15:15.670
You get used to it!

15:16.181 --> 15:18.183
Oh, for heaven's sake!

15:18.183 --> 15:19.548
Get inside!

15:22.354 --> 15:24.390
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

15:24.390 --> 15:28.087
You know perfectly well
I meant "exonerated"!

15:32.498 --> 15:33.499
Hello, Roz.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.000
Hi, Niles.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.991
A cappuccino, please. And one for him.

15:37.503 --> 15:38.470
You don't look so good.

15:38.470 --> 15:41.006
I didn't get much sleep last nightagain.

15:41.006 --> 15:44.009
I'm surprised you're
here after yesterday.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.011
I refuse to be cowed
into changing my routine.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.000
Let me get this.

15:47.479 --> 15:48.981
I have my coffee, I go to work.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.973
Of course, all my patients
want to talk about is Maris.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.475
Esteban's crazed brother
left me a message,

15:54.987 --> 15:57.489
saying I owe some sort of blood debt.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.980
Some days it just doesn't
pay to get off the sofa.

16:01.994 --> 16:03.985
You've had it pretty rough.

16:04.496 --> 16:05.497
What are my choices?

16:05.497 --> 16:07.499
I can go to pieces, or I can bear up

16:07.499 --> 16:08.488
and live my normal life.

16:09.001 --> 16:09.990
Can I get a straw, please?

16:10.402 --> 16:12.495
Oh, sorry, sir, that was the last one.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.438
I see.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.136
The last straw.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.453
Gosh, is it warm in here?

16:27.453 --> 16:30.155
 It is. It is. It's warm in here.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.457
Oh, it's suffocating.

16:31.457 --> 16:32.458
That's better.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.159
I'll get you a straw, Niles.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.160
Do you need a straw?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.161
No, no, no. You heard her.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.463
There are no more straws.

16:37.463 --> 16:42.162
Oh, that feels so much better.

16:42.334 --> 16:47.072
Oh, everything was just
so tight before. Aah!

16:47.072 --> 16:49.575
(straining): Yes! Oh!

16:49.575 --> 16:53.278
Coffee shop without straws?

16:53.278 --> 16:54.313
(giggling)

16:54.313 --> 16:56.304
It makes no sense.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.019
You can borrow my straw, see?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.021
Oh, this is great.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.322
I was being smothered.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.323
Oh, I can breathe!

17:04.323 --> 17:06.018
I don't know how you stand it.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.029
Hello, Frasier? It's me.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.327
How close are you to the cafe?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.034
All right, well, hurry up and park,

17:15.034 --> 17:17.332
because Niles is almost completely...

17:20.039 --> 17:22.337
Niles is completely naked.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.343
Oh... Niles.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.351
I'm calling the cops.

17:32.351 --> 17:33.215
The hell you are.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.554
This man's tips alone have probably paid

17:35.554 --> 17:37.456
for all the pot you'll ever smoke.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.491
Just back off, cowboy.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.482
And that goes for the rest of you, too.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.405
Hello, Niles.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.396
Hey.

17:56.108 --> 17:58.269
What's going on?

17:58.644 --> 18:01.380
Heat wave in Texas.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.116
Well, Niles, maybe you should, uh,

18:04.116 --> 18:06.418
put some clothes on.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.407
Ah...

18:07.820 --> 18:08.912
nah.

18:10.355 --> 18:11.356
No. No, too much. Too much on me.

18:11.356 --> 18:12.858
I'm feeling very constricted.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.849
me. I'm fine now . Don't touch

18:16.295 --> 18:18.163
Niles,

18:18.163 --> 18:20.132
Iook at yourself.

18:20.132 --> 18:22.794
Hello.

18:25.571 --> 18:28.904
I think I'm having that dream
where I'm naked in Nervosa.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.141
I think a lot of people
are having that dream.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.148
We have to go now, Niles.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.638
Oh. But...

18:38.150 --> 18:39.549
you're not getting in my car like that.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.421
Is he okay?

18:42.421 --> 18:44.123
It's just a-a panic attack.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.424
It's happened before,

18:45.424 --> 18:48.127
but he's never been quite this close

18:48.127 --> 18:49.424
to butterfly-net territory.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.433
May I have your apron, please?

18:54.433 --> 18:56.435
And-and yours?

18:56.435 --> 18:59.438
All right, Niles, I'm
going to wrap you up

18:59.438 --> 19:02.141
Iike a big, green Christmas present.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.442
You like Christmas, don't you?

19:03.442 --> 19:04.443
There we are.

19:04.443 --> 19:05.444
Oh.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.433
(chuckling)

19:07.146 --> 19:08.135
ROZ: Okay, listen up.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.150
Me and my friends are
going to back out of here,

19:11.150 --> 19:12.451
nice and easy.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.146
As far as any of you are concerned,

19:14.453 --> 19:15.454
this never happened.

19:15.454 --> 19:18.157
And if any of you decide to be a hero

19:18.157 --> 19:22.457
and call the police,
trust me, I will find you.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.430
Oh, Roz, that was persuasive.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.432
Well, there's nothing
worse than waking up naked

19:27.432 --> 19:28.421
with a bunch of cops standing around.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.834
I bet.

19:31.803 --> 19:33.805
Well, there he is!

19:33.805 --> 19:35.807
Rise and shine, lazybones.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.309
I'm surprised it's still light out.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.311
I thought it would be dark by now.

19:39.311 --> 19:40.312
Well, it was already.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.802
You've been asleep for 20 hours.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.816
Oh, well, I guess I needed it.

19:44.816 --> 19:45.805
So how are you feeling?

19:46.318 --> 19:47.319
Oh, much better.

19:47.319 --> 19:50.322
Frasier, I'm so sorry I embarrassed you.

19:50.322 --> 19:52.256
Niles, you didn't embarrass me one bit.

19:52.591 --> 19:55.260
Well, maybe... maybe just a little.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.562
On our way to the car,

19:56.562 --> 19:58.257
a breeze from a passing school bus

19:58.564 --> 20:02.267
turned your apron into a cape and...

20:02.267 --> 20:03.564
(phone rings)

20:05.504 --> 20:08.407
Hello?

20:08.407 --> 20:09.704
 It's Maris.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.643
You don't have to take this.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.372
No, I really should.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.417
Hello, Maris.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.418
Yes, yes, listen,

20:19.418 --> 20:21.486
there's something I-I want to say...

20:21.486 --> 20:23.388
Yes, but...

20:23.388 --> 20:25.224
Well, of course, you're alone!

20:25.224 --> 20:27.215
You're alone because you
killed your boyfriend!

20:30.329 --> 20:33.365
Now, I am on your side,
but there is a limit

20:33.365 --> 20:35.367
because I have a
wonderful, pregnant wife.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.369
And as far as my attention is concerned,

20:37.369 --> 20:39.871
she comes first, always.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.873
I will help you through this,

20:41.873 --> 20:44.364
but now you have to help
me by saying good-bye.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.343
No. No. No. What do you have to say?

20:46.778 --> 20:48.370
Yes, good-bye.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.817
Now there's the Niles that's
been missing in action.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.519
Thanks for what you said about me.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.521
Though I haven't been
completely wonderful.

20:56.521 --> 20:58.955
No, you've been irritable and
you made me sleep on a couch.

21:00.993 --> 21:01.994
That's the stuff, Niles.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.484
Doesn't it feel good to
get it off your chest?

21:03.795 --> 21:06.525
Oh, stuff it, Mr. Malaprop.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.091
Family spokesman.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.934
The Manson family should
have a spokesman like you.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.731
He's really getting the
hang of this, isn't he?

21:16.375 --> 21:17.672
And you.

21:18.377 --> 21:19.678
I'd have been home from
that jail an hour earlier

21:19.678 --> 21:21.509
if you hadn't convince d your buddies

21:22.014 --> 21:23.504
to let you squeeze off a
few rounds into a Dumpster.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.517
You kept him waiting

21:25.517 --> 21:27.519
while I was at home worried sick?

21:27.519 --> 21:29.021
I was doing him a favor.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.856
Keeping him away from
you and your hormones.

21:30.856 --> 21:31.857
Oh, some favor.

21:31.857 --> 21:32.858
Making me stay with Frasier.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.359
He made me do housework.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.849
I'd forgotten that until this moment.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.360
You made her do housework?!

21:38.664 --> 21:39.898
A pregnant woman? That's pretty low.

21:39.898 --> 21:43.035
Oh, fine! Fine!

21:43.035 --> 21:46.004
Turn your anger on me!

21:46.004 --> 21:48.006
It's almost as if you'd forgotten

21:48.006 --> 21:49.997
that not three days ago,

21:52.411 --> 21:55.903
I was punched in the
face by a man now dead.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.654
Thank you.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.019
Now who wants pancakes?

22:05.305 --> 22:11.231
