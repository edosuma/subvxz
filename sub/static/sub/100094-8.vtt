03:00.555 --> 03:03.725
Your son's abilities are symbiotic
with the flora and fauna

03:03.808 --> 03:06.895
recovered from Iceland
after the aurora event.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.064
Considering Mark's intense interest
in that event,

03:10.815 --> 03:13.526
we suspect he was experiencing
anomalies himself,

03:13.610 --> 03:16.196
and it appears
that he passed them along to Dion.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.364
After Iceland, we began seeing

03:18.448 --> 03:21.034
these erratic micro storms
all over the globe.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.537
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration flagged them, too.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.831
They appear and disappear quickly,

03:27.248 --> 03:28.875

03:31.127 --> 03:32.962
[Suzanne] One of these
was outside your house.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.882
Another was near your lake cabin.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.344
I don't think that's a coincidence.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.555
I think the storms are drawn to your son.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.563
-So what do you want?
-To study Dion.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.775
We need to understand
why this is happening

03:54.150 --> 03:55.276
and what he's capable of.

03:55.693 --> 03:56.527
No.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.905
Oh, I wasn't asking for permission.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.075
The CDC has him on a 72-hour hold,

04:02.450 --> 04:04.786
and that period
can be extended indefinitely

04:04.869 --> 04:06.746
if he's deemed a danger to the public.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.540
-But he's not a danger--
-There again, I wasn't asking.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.418

to keep him quarantined...

04:13.628 --> 04:14.629

Changes to his DNA.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.920
And he kept in contact with people
who experienced the event.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.297
In exchange,

04:57.839 --> 05:00.133
you let me take Dion home now.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.971
Also, I want all of this stuff.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.225
where they happened,
and if they will happen again.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.320
-The farmer, Walter.
-Mm-hmm.

12:18.404 --> 12:22.032
[inhales] He, uh, got his abilities
at the same time as me and Mark.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.701
His son did, too. Brayden.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.744
[inhales]

12:24.827 --> 12:27.747
Which means he's second generation,
like Dion.

12:30.082 --> 12:30.916
Well...

12:31.709 --> 12:35.337
at least he still has his father
to help him understand things, you know.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.672
Storm took him.

12:37.047 --> 12:37.882
[Nicole] What?

12:39.258 --> 12:43.220
[stammering] When? He was alive
when Dion went to BIONA's labs.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.222
Well, he didn't stay alive very long.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.021
I can't let Dion leave this apartment.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.648
I have to go to work,
and he has to go to school.

12:54.732 --> 12:55.775
I can stay with him.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.694
-What, forever?
-Well, let's just get through today.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.196

13:12.291 --> 13:13.125
[Nicole] Hey.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.043
[Pat] Hey.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.297
Uh, I didn't get a call, so I'm here,

13:18.380 --> 13:22.468
just barreling through our awkward stage
to take Dion to school.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.513
I mean,
I'm not sure if he's going to school,

13:25.596 --> 13:29.558
uh, after the night he's had,
but I... I wanted to check on him.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.187
Yeah, a lot's happened since the hospital.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.104
Yeah, I know.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.022
Um...

13:35.314 --> 13:38.067
Suzanne, uh, called me in late last night,

13:38.150 --> 13:41.612
asked me to look over the data
that you gave her, the--

13:41.695 --> 13:42.988
Mark's data.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.407
So she knows you've been in on it now?

13:45.491 --> 13:47.076
Yeah. Um...

13:47.910 --> 13:51.038
What did she offer you in exchange?
Besides Dion.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.415
Uh, just maps of the storm,

13:53.499 --> 13:56.418
and, uh, her assurances
that she's on our side.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.297
Well, for what it's worth,
I actually think she is.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.424
Or at least she's not <i>not</i> on your side.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.761
The aurora event
caused some sort of extreme damage,

14:05.845 --> 14:08.681
and the land up there is literally dying.

14:08.764 --> 14:12.101
Huge crevices have opened up,
and it's spreading, so she's just...

14:12.184 --> 14:13.018
[inhales]

14:13.102 --> 14:15.145
She's trying to figure out how to stop it.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.231
Right, and she thinks
Dion can help with that.

14:17.898 --> 14:18.816
I mean, he...

14:19.108 --> 14:21.110
he reversed the disease in the fox.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.363
Maybe he can reverse
the necrosis in Iceland, I...

14:24.446 --> 14:25.489
[laughs]

14:25.573 --> 14:27.408
-You know?
-Does she really think that?

14:27.491 --> 14:29.118
[Pat] Uh, she's following the science.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.829
You know, everything that was changed
by that event,

14:32.329 --> 14:35.624
Dion, the plants, the ground, uh, Mark,

14:35.708 --> 14:36.542
it's all...

14:36.625 --> 14:38.836
all pieces of the puzzle.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.255
-And she still hates me.
-Yeah.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.214
[laughs] Yep.

14:42.298 --> 14:46.385
But, for now, I'll-- I'll be there
to watch her for you.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.596
-You don't have to do that.
-Yeah, I do.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.472
Remember, we're--

14:51.098 --> 14:52.099
Nothing's changed.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.102

15:02.484 --> 15:03.611
Oh!

15:03.694 --> 15:06.697
They put me in a science room like E.T.,
but I'm okay now.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.909
-That is awesome.
-So, taking me to school today?

15:10.367 --> 15:11.869
You know what? One second, honey.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.163
Um, I need to talk to him for a minute.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.164
[Pat] Yeah. Yeah.

Why not?

15:33.724 --> 15:35.517
Honey, because it's too dangerous.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.728
I have to work on my science project.

15:37.811 --> 15:40.731
-Well, some things are more important.
-Than science?

15:41.148 --> 15:42.691

-What?

15:43.275 --> 15:44.234
Yes!

15:44.318 --> 15:47.029
I'll go with him.
I'll... I'll hang with Dion all day.

No.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.491

Okay.

15:58.832 --> 15:59.708
But what if...

15:59.792 --> 16:02.419
It'll be fine.
I'll be with him every minute.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.046
Not in the bathroom.

16:06.924 --> 16:07.967
Everything's okay.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.343
Okay.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.845

-Who's that?

Mr. Campbell. He tried to suspend me.

-[Charlotte] Why?
-Mom said he grew up with some bad ideas.

Who people are

that you could make the presentation,

33:05.942 --> 33:07.819
He did! Show him.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.905
It's dumb. I didn't know what to do.

33:18.788 --> 33:19.789
What's the hose for?

33:20.206 --> 33:21.708
Uh, you know, the, uh...

33:21.791 --> 33:23.876
-Um...
-Cold air...

33:23.960 --> 33:25.795
from a liquid nitrogen canister.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.714
[stammers] Yeah, the cold air stuff.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.841
-It, uh...
-[Dion groans]

33:29.924 --> 33:33.177
Changes the temperature of the storm
and takes away its power.

33:33.803 --> 33:34.637
Okay.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.889
Wait. You... you made this?

33:37.181 --> 33:38.016
Yeah.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.851
-And the rubber straps?
-[Jonathan] Well...

33:42.103 --> 33:44.480
I figured if there's a storm,
there's gonna be some lightning,

33:44.564 --> 33:47.567
and rubber stops lightning, I think.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.027
[Mr. Fry laughs]

33:49.110 --> 33:51.195
It's a little more complicated than that.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.906
No, but keep doing research.

33:53.990 --> 33:54.949
Good thinking, though.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.117
When will it be finished?

33:56.200 --> 33:58.411
Today, after school. Promise.

33:58.661 --> 33:59.495
Okay.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.665
You've got until tomorrow, okay?

34:02.749 --> 34:04.625
[school bell rings]

34:07.962 --> 34:10.673
-I can't come over after school today.
-You don't need to.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.593
Jonathan and I are gonna play Zelda
after school anyway.

34:14.469 --> 34:15.303
What?

34:16.054 --> 34:17.889
We'll finish
his part of the project first.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.308
-You're playing Zelda?
-[Esperanza] Yeah.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.935
I would've invited you,
but you hate Zelda.

34:23.019 --> 34:24.979
I don't hate Zelda.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.231
Hey, Jonathan. Come here.

34:29.609 --> 34:30.860
[Esperanza] What do they want?

34:30.943 --> 34:33.780
They're so mean to him.
I don't even know why he talks to them.

34:33.863 --> 34:34.781
They're his friends.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.908
Uh, not really.
They're being nice to him one day,

34:36.991 --> 34:38.743
but then, the next,
they're making fun of him.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.162
Where he lives, his dad...

34:41.662 --> 34:42.997
Hey, what's up, guys?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.957
Uh, I'm gonna go to the skate park
with the guys.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.086
But we promised
we would finish the Storm Killer!

34:48.169 --> 34:51.005
-You coming or not?
-I'm not waiting.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.842
What about the project?

34:55.676 --> 34:57.929
You do your part. Don't worry about mine.

34:58.012 --> 35:00.014
Hey, it's due tomorrow.
It's our project, too.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.266
-It's okay, I'll do it.
-[Dion] What?

35:02.475 --> 35:03.643
-[Jonathan] Hey.
-[Dion grunts]

35:03.726 --> 35:05.103
She'll do it better anyway.

35:09.107 --> 35:09.941
Hey.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.275
Come with me.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.654
Forget about Jonathan.
I wanna show you something fun.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.280
Quick.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.664
[electricity crackles]

35:24.747 --> 35:25.748
What are you doing?

35:26.165 --> 35:27.250
Shh.

35:28.668 --> 35:29.669
What are you doing?

35:30.419 --> 35:31.921
Who needs skateboards when...

35:32.630 --> 35:34.006
you can fly?

35:34.674 --> 35:37.051
Dion, put me down!

35:37.844 --> 35:39.971
I used to only be able to lift
Froot Loops.

35:40.346 --> 35:41.931
Put me down!

35:42.014 --> 35:44.642
Wait! Here comes the best part.
You're gonna miss it.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.397
Wait. What are you doing with my legs?

35:49.772 --> 35:50.898
Put me down!

35:51.691 --> 35:52.692
Dion!

35:59.448 --> 36:00.616
Why did you do that?

36:01.033 --> 36:03.161
-Why are you mad?
-You took me out of my chair.

36:03.244 --> 36:06.497
You lifted me out of my chair.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.624
Why would you do that?

36:09.167 --> 36:10.793
-I wanted you to--
-Walk?

36:11.711 --> 36:12.962
Yes.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.009
Open the door.

36:21.762 --> 36:22.763
Thank you.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.441
Hey. What are you doing here?

36:35.401 --> 36:36.319
Uh...

36:37.737 --> 36:39.655
[voice breaking]
I told myself, you know...

36:41.199 --> 36:43.159
if you let something go
and it's meant to be,

36:43.242 --> 36:44.744
it'll come back to you.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.455
I'm so stupid.

36:49.123 --> 36:49.957
Um...

36:50.917 --> 36:52.835
Pat, I don't really know
what's going on with you,

36:52.919 --> 36:56.464
but I'm running late to the printer,
so can we just talk about this later?

36:56.839 --> 36:58.633
-Um, no.
-[Nicole] No?

36:59.759 --> 37:00.593
No.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.346
I'm, uh... I'm so tired of this.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.848
Whenever you need me, I'm there.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.684
To take Dion to school, for... for pizza.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.854
You ask and I drop everything for you,

37:11.938 --> 37:14.232
and I'm there
with a big old smile on my face.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.443
Why are you doing this now?

37:18.819 --> 37:22.114
Uh, I think you are
taking advantage of me.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.325
Because you know that I...

37:27.870 --> 37:30.164
Because you know
that I have feelings for you.

37:38.714 --> 37:39.799
I'm sorry, I...

37:41.467 --> 37:42.468
I never meant to--

37:43.261 --> 37:44.095
But...

37:44.762 --> 37:46.472
you're right. I, um...

37:47.765 --> 37:50.226
I shouldn't have continued
to lean on you like that.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.853
So, are you...
are you, uh, seeing that guy?

37:56.482 --> 37:57.358
Excuse me?

37:58.943 --> 37:59.944
[deep breath]

38:00.486 --> 38:04.490
This morning when I picked Dion up,
there was an extra plate at the table.

38:04.573 --> 38:06.492
Was it him? Or, like...

38:11.664 --> 38:14.166
That's none of your business.

38:14.583 --> 38:15.459
Really?

38:15.543 --> 38:16.752
-[Nicole] Yes.
-Hmm.

38:17.878 --> 38:21.340
And I appreciate everything
that you've done for me and Dion, but...

38:22.591 --> 38:24.593
who I have breakfast with,

38:25.136 --> 38:27.888
who I whatever with,
it's... it's none of your business.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.766
Well, but see, the thing is Nicole,
you are my business.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.519
Okay? I've been keeping your secrets.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.771
I've been risking my job for you.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.315
And you... you... [upset laugh]

38:37.398 --> 38:39.817
[sniffs] You let me think
I had a shot, I guess,

38:39.900 --> 38:41.193
so I could just keep on being

38:41.277 --> 38:43.321
-your pathetic little errand boy.
-Okay, um...

38:43.821 --> 38:44.947
This conversation's over.

38:45.031 --> 38:48.034
Actually, um...
I have to get back to work.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.077
Oh, all right.
Well, we'll finish it tonight

38:50.161 --> 38:51.912
when I bring Dion home.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.291
You know what? You don't have to,
because I have it taken care of.

38:55.750 --> 38:56.584
What?

38:56.667 --> 38:59.628
And you know,  I think maybe
we should just... take a break.

38:59.712 --> 39:00.546
[scoffs]

39:01.005 --> 39:02.214
Take a break. From what?

39:02.298 --> 39:04.759
From you spending time with Dion, with me.

39:09.597 --> 39:10.431
Well...

39:10.514 --> 39:11.349
[scoffs]

39:11.849 --> 39:13.768
You're not keeping me from Dion.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.812
-Excuse me?
-[Pat] He loves me.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.856
Hell, I spend more time with him than you.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.361
This conversation is so over.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.197
You stay away from me,
and you stay away from Dion.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.661
[students chattering indistinctly]

39:38.417 --> 39:41.504
I don't get it. Why is Esperanza so mad?

39:41.587 --> 39:42.421
Oh.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.840
Let us get out of this place,

39:45.091 --> 39:47.885
away from all these people,

39:47.968 --> 39:51.764
and then we will discuss
your disaster with Esperanza.

39:51.847 --> 39:53.265
[cell phone beeping]

39:53.682 --> 39:55.643
-Hey.
-Hey, is Dion with you?

39:55.726 --> 39:57.061
Yes, I just picked him up.

39:57.144 --> 40:01.524
Okay, don't tell him, but Pat and I
just got into the weirdest fight.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.734
[Charlotte] <i>Uh, want me to do a thing?</i>

40:03.818 --> 40:05.861
One zap and he'll never pee right again.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.321
No... [sighs] It's fine.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.658
-He just needs to stay away and cool off.
-[Charlotte] <i>Well, we're on our way home.</i>

40:10.741 --> 40:12.701
-[Dion] <i>Can you take me to Esperanza's?</i>
-No.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.328
No. Hey, are you okay?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.496
[Nicole] <i>No, I'm mad!</i>

40:15.579 --> 40:18.040
He acted like he was entitled
to something from me

40:18.124 --> 40:20.000
and accused me of seeing someone
behind his back.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.837
<i>Is his back even relevant?</i>
<i>His back has nothing to do with me.</i>

40:22.920 --> 40:25.589
Look, you know,
you're getting a little lost in this.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.092
Look, I tried to be honest with him.
I tried, at least,

40:28.175 --> 40:31.220
and he still came away from it
expecting something from me.

40:31.303 --> 40:34.640
I really need to get out of here.
Can we talk about this later?

40:35.182 --> 40:38.894
Just don't let Pat talk to him, okay?
And... and I'll see you guys at home.

40:39.728 --> 40:40.729
[disconnects call]

40:44.442 --> 40:45.776
[Dion] It wasn't that bad.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.945
[Charlotte] I was there. It was bad.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.197
If I were in a wheelchair,
I would want to fly.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.283
Well, you are not Esperanza.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.118
Everybody wants to fly.

40:54.201 --> 40:56.620
I think you've just proven
that that is not true.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.539
[Charlotte sighs]

40:58.831 --> 41:00.207
What do you know about her?

41:01.625 --> 41:03.127
Well, why is she in the chair?

41:03.794 --> 41:06.547
How long has she been in the chair?
Has she ever walked?

41:08.674 --> 41:10.342
Dude, you've been friends with her
how long?

41:10.426 --> 41:13.304
And you've never talked about it?
You've never even asked?

41:14.430 --> 41:16.265
I don't think about it. It's just--

41:16.891 --> 41:18.267
It's Esperanza.

41:19.852 --> 41:23.272
Now, that, I think she would want
to hear you say.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.151
[man coughing]

41:27.902 --> 41:29.987
[coughing continues]

41:31.572 --> 41:33.199
-[coughing]
-[Charlotte] Um...

41:33.282 --> 41:35.534
Why don't you go inside,  and...

41:36.160 --> 41:38.037
I will join you in a few minutes.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.248
-[Dion] Can I FaceTime with Esperanza?
-[Charlotte] Absolutely.

41:42.374 --> 41:43.250
[exhales]

41:48.255 --> 41:49.215
[exhales]

41:49.507 --> 41:50.341
[sniffs]

41:50.591 --> 41:52.134
-Excuse me.
-Pat, right?

41:53.594 --> 41:54.845
I'm a friend of Nicole's.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.641
Oh. Hi, I'm just gonna go say hi
to to Dion.

41:58.724 --> 42:01.727
Actually, uh,
Dion's had a really long day.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.771
He's... he's really not up for company.

42:04.230 --> 42:08.067
-Well, he'll wanna see me.
-Nicole asked me not to let you see him.

42:08.150 --> 42:09.109
[scoffs]

42:09.401 --> 42:10.277
What?

42:10.694 --> 42:12.321
She doesn't want you to see him.

42:12.905 --> 42:13.822
I'm sorry.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.324
That's ridiculous. [exhales]

42:15.407 --> 42:16.617
Well, it's her choice.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.577
Okay, uh, you know what?
I want to talk to Dion.

42:18.661 --> 42:21.247
You know, why don't you just go home
and take some time?

42:21.330 --> 42:24.833
[groans in pain] You know what?
I don't have time. Okay.

42:25.584 --> 42:28.337
Nicole and I just had
a small disagreement, okay?

42:28.420 --> 42:31.757
-I'm practically the kid's father.
-Whoa. You are entitled.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.050
She called me entitled?

42:33.926 --> 42:36.595
Well, you know what? Yeah, actually,
I am entitled to see my godson,

42:36.679 --> 42:38.180
so get the hell out of my way.

42:38.430 --> 42:39.265
I...

42:39.932 --> 42:40.808
said...

42:41.225 --> 42:42.810
-[electricity crackles]
-no.

42:45.854 --> 42:46.689
[scoffing]

42:47.356 --> 42:49.358
I should have killed you in New Orleans.

42:49.775 --> 42:51.277
[electricity crackling]

42:57.491 --> 42:59.034
[electricity crackling loudly]

43:00.536 --> 43:01.370
No.

43:03.872 --> 43:05.332
[lightning crackling]

43:05.416 --> 43:06.542
[cell phone rings]

43:06.625 --> 43:07.501
Hello?

43:07.585 --> 43:08.836
-[Suzanne] <i>Where are you?</i>
-Why?

43:08.919 --> 43:11.171
There's a micro storm forming right now
at your building.

43:11.255 --> 43:14.592
-Come to BIONA. We can protect you here.
-No, no, Dion is at home.

43:16.510 --> 43:17.511
Jesus.

43:17.595 --> 43:18.679
[thunder rumbles]

43:18.762 --> 43:20.848
Come on, come on. Pick up, pick up.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.057
[thunder rumbles]

43:24.727 --> 43:25.894
[Charlotte screams]

43:30.065 --> 43:35.529
You can't have Dion!

43:35.863 --> 43:37.197
[groaning]

43:42.328 --> 43:44.455
[Charlotte groaning]

43:45.205 --> 43:46.081
[grunts]

43:46.832 --> 43:48.584
[Charlotte grunting]

43:52.254 --> 43:53.130
[Charlotte] No!

43:53.213 --> 43:56.759
[Charlotte screaming]

43:56.842 --> 43:57.676
No!

43:59.762 --> 44:02.056
[dramatic music playing]
