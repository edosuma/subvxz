As you know, detective,

21:25.134 --> 21:26.667
witnesses involved
in motor vehicle accidents

21:26.669 --> 21:28.835

21:28.837 --> 21:31.538

dramatically different

21:31.540 --> 21:33.373

than the evidence suggests.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.042
Look, I know what
you're thinking here,

21:35.044 --> 21:36.843
but I was there,
and I'm telling you--

21:36.845 --> 21:40.647
Ballistics came back
from the FBI lab.

21:40.649 --> 21:43.217
It was your weapon,
detective.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.752
[foreboding music]

21:45.754 --> 21:48.188
We believe the crash vehicle
was one of Dominic's men

21:48.190 --> 21:50.324
attempting to spring him
from custody.

21:50.326 --> 21:52.059
Dominic stole
a guard's weapon,

21:52.061 --> 21:56.663
and when he tried to escape,
you shot him.

21:56.665 --> 21:58.165
That's not how
I remembered it--

21:58.167 --> 22:00.834

Ten Most Wanted

22:00.836 --> 22:03.437
from fleeing the scene.

22:03.439 --> 22:06.340
And when he turned on you,
it became self-defense.

22:06.342 --> 22:10.110
You're a hero, detective.

22:10.112 --> 22:12.246
- Let me take a look at that.
- Sorry.

This is a federal case now.

for commendation.
