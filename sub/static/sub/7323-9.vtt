18:17.096 --> 18:20.099
YEAH. MORE LIKE MORONIC. I HAVE
NO IDEA HOW TO GET THEM APART

18:20.099 --> 18:23.273
WITHOUT TAKING OFF
HALF THEIR SKIN.
TRY ACETONE.

18:23.273 --> 18:26.406

COVER ALL YOUR BASES

CALLING HIM,

19:11.481 --> 19:15.325

MY MOST PROMISING RESIDENT
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN,

27:38.688 --> 27:41.330
IS MIXING IRISH CAR BOMBS
FOR A BACHELOR PARTY

27:41.330 --> 27:43.162
OVER AT JOE'S BAR.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.264
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA MENTION

27:45.264 --> 27:49.298
THAT SHE'S LETTING THE BACHELORS
FEEL HER UP AT WILL,

27:49.298 --> 27:51.701
'CAUSE THAT
JUST ADDS INSULT TO INJURY.

27:51.701 --> 27:54.303
CRAP. I'M--I'MREALLYDRUNK.

27:54.303 --> 27:56.445
PICTURES ARE UP.

27:58.047 --> 28:01.050
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
THAT REDHEAD MISSED OUT.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.953
(laughs)
IF JOE'S
WERE A LESBIAN BAR,

28:03.953 --> 28:06.716
YOU'D HAVE BEEN
UP TO YOUR EARS IN--
PLEASE DON'T SAY VAGINA.

28:06.716 --> 28:08.788
WELL, NOW I DON'T HAVE TO.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.790
(laughs) GOD.
OOH.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.361
I HATE BEING DRUNK.

28:12.361 --> 28:14.794
(sighs) YOU THINK IT'S GONNA
MAKE YOU FEEL AWESOME AND HAPPY,

28:14.794 --> 28:17.366
BUT IT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL
TIRED AND GROSS.

28:17.366 --> 28:19.698
WELL, YANG LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS HAVING FUN TONIGHT.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.700
WHAT, THE CRAZY
PARTY GIRL THING?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.733
THAT'S CRAP.

28:23.733 --> 28:25.735
EVERY GIRL
WHO CLIMBS UP ON A TABLE

28:25.735 --> 28:28.307
THINKS SHE'S THE HOTTEST GIRL
IN THE ROOM, BUT...

28:28.307 --> 28:31.440
REALLY,
SHE'S JUST DANCING ALONE.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.282
YOU OKAY?

28:33.282 --> 28:35.945
YEAH. (exhales deeply)

28:35.945 --> 28:38.717
I JUST... I NEED TO SLEEP.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.850
I NEED TO SLEEP.

28:40.850 --> 28:41.851
(groans)

28:41.851 --> 28:43.923
ALL RIGHT.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.255
(exhales) OH, YEAH.

28:46.255 --> 28:48.157

28:48.157 --> 28:50.860

28:50.860 --> 28:53.732
(laughs)

28:53.732 --> 28:55.805
MM.

28:55.805 --> 28:58.007
DREW'S GOT
A PERFORATED ULCER.

28:58.007 --> 29:00.840
AND CRISTINA'S WORKING
AT JOE'S.
WHAT?

29:00.840 --> 29:02.471
FORGET IT. IT'S BLEEDING,

29:02.471 --> 29:05.144
AND IT MUST BE FROM
THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES.
WAIT. WH-WHAT ABOUT CRISTINA?

29:05.144 --> 29:07.016
SHE'S A BARTENDER NOW.

29:07.016 --> 29:10.049
I CALLED STARK IN
AND NO ANSWER.
WELL, BIG SURPRISE.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.421
THIS KID NEEDS SURGERY.
I KNOW.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.257
(Meredith) MRS. McNEIL.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.530
THIS IS ALEX KAREV. HE'LL BE
CONSULTING ON YOUR SON'S CASE.

29:21.530 --> 29:24.233
THE C.T. SCAN REVEALED THAT
YOUR SON HAS A PERFORATED ULCER.

29:24.233 --> 29:26.435
THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING
HIS PAIN.

29:26.435 --> 29:28.838
SO DOES HE NEED SURGERY?
YES.

29:28.838 --> 29:31.440
AND WE'VE CALLED DR. STARK,
AND HE'S ON HIS WAY.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.402
WE CAN START PREPPING HIM
IMMEDIATELY.

29:33.402 --> 29:35.404
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.180
OKAY, SO HOLD ON.
ARE WE REALLY

29:41.180 --> 29:43.913
GONNA CALL IN A WHOLE O.R. TEAM
WITHOUT AN ATTENDING?

29:43.913 --> 29:46.215
I MEAN, WHAT IF STARK
DOESN'T ANSWER THE PAGE?

29:46.215 --> 29:49.919
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T
COME IN ON TIME?
WHAT IF THE KID DIES WHILE
WE'RE WAITING TO FIND OUT?

29:49.919 --> 29:51.921
LOOK, I'M TAKING THIS KID
TO THE O.R.

29:51.921 --> 29:53.893
WHETHER STARK COMES OR NOT.
LIKE THE CHIEF SAID.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.795
THIS IS HOW YOU
GET THINGS DONE AT NIGHT.
WHAT IF WE HAVE TO DO
A TRUNCAL VAGATOMY

29:56.795 --> 29:59.969
OR A PYLOROPLASTY? HAVE YOU
EVER DONE THOSE ON YOUR OWN?

29:59.969 --> 30:03.132
NOT ONLY CAN I DO IT.
I CAN DO IT BETTER THAN STARK.

30:03.132 --> 30:04.834
ARE YOU IN OR OUT?

30:04.834 --> 30:07.937
WELL, LIKE HELL IF I'M GONNA
LET YOU DO IT WITHOUT ME.

30:07.937 --> 30:09.979
I'M IN.

30:20.149 --> 30:22.151
OKAY. IS HE UNDER?

30:22.151 --> 30:24.153
IS HE TALKING?
YEAH. HE'S UNDER.

30:24.153 --> 30:26.555
NO WORD FROM STARK YET?

30:26.555 --> 30:29.959
NO.
CALL HIM EVERY FIVE MINUTES
UNTIL HE ANSWERS.

30:29.959 --> 30:31.961
(Alex) AND PAGE DR. BAILEY.
BAILEY'S NOT ON CALL TONIGHT.

30:31.961 --> 30:35.504
JUST KEEP CALLING HER.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU COULD
DO THIS BETTER THAN STARK.

30:35.504 --> 30:37.166
