WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:05.505
- Honey?
- Hmm. A little higher.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.840
A little to the left.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.877
Whoa, not Ted Kennedy left.

00:10.912 --> 00:12.879
Oh.
Split the difference.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.347
- How's that?
- Uh, a little more towards Ted.

00:15.382 --> 00:18.151
- You know what?
- Honey, honey, we were so close.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.654
Yeah, we've been close for like 15
minutes. My back's killing me, you know?

00:21.689 --> 00:24.791
Plus, I don't get it. I thought we
were gonna put it on this wall here.

00:25.225 --> 00:28.360
No, that wall needs to stay clear
so when Dad gets his inheritance,

00:28.395 --> 00:31.898
we can buy the apartment next door, and
we can push it and make this room bigger.

00:32.432 --> 00:34.399
I don't want to spend money
we don't have.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.401
We're spending money like crazy.
We talked about this.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.406
This would be a natural TV area.
You have more room to breathe here.

00:39.441 --> 00:41.442
This can become like your
dining room area.

00:41.477 --> 00:43.408
You can put a dining table
in there, whatever.

00:43.443 --> 00:46.012
If we can still afford it.
I mean, I don't get this stuff.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.581
We've got bird cages-- That's
good, that's good. Yeah?

00:48.616 --> 00:50.450
all over the place,
but no birds, and balloons.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.784
I mean, if they lit up,
they'd make sense.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.754
But who has balloons in
Brooklyn? Ah, that's nice.

00:54.789 --> 00:56.756
Oh, that's--
that's good.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.226
Yeah? Oh, oh.
You know, so I--

01:00.593 --> 01:02.595
Where are you going?

01:02.630 --> 01:04.896
What?

01:04.931 --> 01:07.600
Honey, the kids.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.209
Yo, Gavin.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.145
Caught a body down in Chinatown.
You want to work it with me?

01:19.180 --> 01:21.481
No, I'm actually kind of
involved over here.

01:21.981 --> 01:25.034
Yeah, I see that. I never knew
you were a fan of the open water.

01:25.069 --> 01:28.053
I'm a fan of anyplace where
people ain't shooting at my ass.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.458
Your stepmother croaks, you just put
in your papers and expect to cash in.

01:31.758 --> 01:35.628
Hey, I've been making inquiries,
jerk-off. I spoke to the estate lawyer.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.664
He says we got
a sizable payout coming.

01:37.964 --> 01:42.502
Shit, Dad and those 28 mangy
cats-- that's all the old slope had.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.838
Oh, lucky lady.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.107
Yeah, have fun
with your stiff.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:56.683 --> 01:58.650
Oh, my God.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.820
This is amazing.

02:00.855 --> 02:02.921
Yeah, I know.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.493
Oh. Baby, I don't just mean
the sex. I mean everything.

02:06.528 --> 02:08.929
You, me, the kids,
this apartment--

02:08.964 --> 02:11.331
It's like we never
skipped a beat.

02:11.831 --> 02:15.602
I know. It's like magic. Whew!

02:15.835 --> 02:18.636
We should renew our vows.

02:18.671 --> 02:22.373
Huh? You know, have
like a little ceremony.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.878
Invite our friends and family,
let the whole world know...

02:25.378 --> 02:27.714
that we're still devoted
to one another.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.350
Well, that sounds like
a lot of work, honey.

02:30.385 --> 02:32.519
Can't we just get
some tattoos or something?

02:34.821 --> 02:38.825
Tommy, it'll be
a fresh start.

02:38.860 --> 02:42.829
Everything else--
all in the past.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.834
Everything?

02:47.869 --> 02:50.354
Yeah.

02:50.389 --> 02:52.839
Deal?

02:58.845 --> 03:00.847
All right. Deal.

03:02.048 --> 03:03.883
The ring maker will be here
in 10 minutes.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.890
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The ring maker? Hon?

03:17.430 --> 03:20.565
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

03:20.600 --> 03:23.670
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

03:23.705 --> 03:26.471
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

03:26.506 --> 03:29.809
Things were good
when we were young

03:30.243 --> 03:33.413
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

03:33.448 --> 03:36.583
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

03:36.618 --> 03:40.018
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

03:40.053 --> 03:42.855
Things were good
when we were young

03:43.256 --> 03:46.224
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

03:46.259 --> 03:49.495
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

03:49.762 --> 03:52.932
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

03:52.967 --> 03:56.102
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

04:00.540 --> 04:04.227
The pearl symbolizes
faithfulness and humility.

04:04.262 --> 04:07.914
The ruby symbolizes
beauty, happiness, love...

04:07.949 --> 04:09.881
and passion.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.785
And the emerald symbolizes
rebirth,

04:13.286 --> 04:15.121
hope, and peace.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.041
Oh, I like all that stuff.
Yeah.

04:19.076 --> 04:21.127
Which one of these is--
is the most,

04:21.161 --> 04:24.464
you know, special.

04:24.964 --> 04:26.864
You mean price-wise?

04:26.899 --> 04:28.766
I didn't say anything
about prices.

04:28.801 --> 04:31.804
I'm talking, you know,
what's the most rare?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.307
Oh, well,
that would be the ruby,

04:34.807 --> 04:36.609
then the emerald,
then the pearl...

04:36.809 --> 04:38.843
and then the--
Onyx. Got you.

04:38.878 --> 04:42.882
You know, what would, like, one ring
look like with all four of the stones?

04:42.917 --> 04:45.885
Well, we can design it
in any formation you desire.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.887
Uh-huh.
I like that.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.355
Yeah, yeah.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.893
Um, what's this--
this brown one here?

04:54.327 --> 04:56.729
What is that?

04:56.996 --> 04:58.965
That's an agate.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.334
Right, and that
symbolizes what?

05:01.369 --> 05:06.738
Dirt, soil,
the outdoors.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.542
Uh-huh, and-- and how
rare would that one be?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.310
Not very.

05:12.345 --> 05:15.313
Right. That could be an
interesting thing, you know?

05:15.348 --> 05:18.217
It's kind of like common
people. Like back to our roots.

05:18.685 --> 05:22.689
You know, back to the, uh--
to the earth. You know? Dirt?

05:22.724 --> 05:25.458
Well, no, earth.
Back to the earth.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.228
Back to the earth, honey,

05:29.263 --> 05:31.264
from whence we came?

05:31.299 --> 05:33.733
Hon?

05:34.233 --> 05:36.202
Asshole, you don't have
any cubic zirconias here?

05:36.669 --> 05:39.038
Tommy?
- Coming.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.508
You can't help me out
a little bit?

05:46.446 --> 05:48.348
You don't like
the whole earth thing?

05:49.749 --> 05:51.217
The flowers and the roots--

05:51.751 --> 05:53.851
- You should be dead.
- Uh, what?

05:53.886 --> 05:57.190
9/11, the Harlem Tenement fires in '88,

05:57.557 --> 05:59.125
that fall that you took
three weeks ago.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.261
Tommy, how many second chances
do you think you're gonna get?

06:04.664 --> 06:07.533
Look, most of the couples that we
went to school with who got married--

06:08.034 --> 06:11.037
almost all of them are either dead
or divorced, just like we almost were.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.707
Baby, this isn't
about the money.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.144
This is about what
little time we have left.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.050
Oh, shit!

06:26.085 --> 06:29.053
Jesus, you scared me, Jeannie.

06:29.088 --> 06:32.056
It's okay.
It's just a little nick.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.527
Go ahead downstairs.
Rose has got breakfast going.

06:34.562 --> 06:38.331
Go ahead.
Go ahead, honey.

06:38.366 --> 06:40.633
I'm okay.
Go ahead.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.921
Come on, bro. Finish up. We're
gonna be late. I got problems, dude.

07:02.121 --> 07:03.689
No shit. But we can't
get into that right now.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.959
I don't want to miss the 40 minutes
of commercials they show before--

07:06.994 --> 07:09.662
No, no, no. I mean, I
got serious problems.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.464
I felt a--

07:11.964 --> 07:13.466
a lump on--

07:13.966 --> 07:15.733
on my testicle.

07:15.768 --> 07:19.272
You felt a what on your what?
My nut, a lump on my nut.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.140
No, no. Come on.
It's probably nothing.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.007
You think?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.977
Think of your marble bag
like it's a chick's purse.

07:25.478 --> 07:26.979
There's all kinds of shit
you don't know about.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.280
Go nosing around, you find
something you don't like.

07:29.315 --> 07:33.953
No, I know my balls pretty good, and this
definitely feels like a new addition to the party.

07:33.988 --> 07:37.323
No, I think you're flipping out
over nothing. Come on. Let's go.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.328
All right, let's see.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.597
Put your leg up. It's not a
wart. You can't look at it.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.500
So pop the hood.
Come on. Put your leg up.

07:47.535 --> 07:50.001
If I'm gonna do this,
turn your head, okay?

07:50.036 --> 07:52.505
I don't want to make any
eye contact with you at all.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.681
All right now, cough.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.868
He does it. Such a tool.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.985
Which one is it?
The left.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.990
Yeah? Mine or yours? Mine.
Can you hurry this up please?

08:11.025 --> 08:12.992
Yeah, all right, you know
what? Just to compare,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.995
I should probably just
feel mine, you know?

08:17.196 --> 08:19.265
Oh, whoa.
Yeah, I feel something.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.733
Me or you?
It's you.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.369
It's a lump or something,
Whatever it is, it's weird.

08:23.404 --> 08:26.205
Hi, Laura. What's up?

08:27.173 --> 08:29.609
You tell me.

08:36.515 --> 08:40.051
Uh, you know what, bro?

08:40.086 --> 08:42.587
I think we should rain-check
on the movie, because I gotta--

08:42.623 --> 08:44.590
There's some stuff that
I gotta take care of.

08:45.057 --> 08:47.059
But really,
get it checked out.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.531
Hey, Laura, wait up.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.068
Hey, Franco, I'm kind of in a hurry
right now. Hey, what's the rush?

08:56.536 --> 08:59.572
You know, I just gotta go home
and just wash this place off of me.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.839
Yeah, well, I can help you
out with that, you know?

09:01.874 --> 09:05.478
Light a few candles, pop a bottle of
vino, maybe run you a bath or something?

09:05.513 --> 09:07.847
Franco, we had
this conversation.

09:07.882 --> 09:10.147
We're done, over,
finis,no mas.

09:10.182 --> 09:13.386
Listen, baby, okay? You didn't give
me a chance to explain, all right?

09:13.421 --> 09:16.088
Now, look, what happened last
week-- us seeing other people...

09:16.389 --> 09:17.957
and rubbing each other's
nose in it--

09:18.457 --> 09:21.727
Yeah, it was pretty shitty. But I have never
been more sure that we should be together.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.729
Franco, I wasn't--
There is no better way...

09:24.764 --> 09:28.501
to measure how much you love someone
than by how far you'll go to hurt them.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.970
What? Do you really
believe that?

09:31.404 --> 09:34.438
Listen, when my dad first went to propose
to my mom, she turned him down cold.

09:34.473 --> 09:38.311
She didn't want anything to do with him. Her
brother had her convinced he was bad news.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.578
So you know what he did?
My dad?

09:40.613 --> 09:44.083
He goes to her brother's house, whups
his ass within an inch of his life.

09:44.118 --> 09:46.519
Just leaves his grill
laying all over the street.

09:46.554 --> 09:49.320
She was moved,
and who wouldn't be, huh?

09:49.355 --> 09:52.758
They were at city hall the next
day getting their blood tests taken.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.361
They've been married
ever since.

09:55.396 --> 09:57.363
So, how about that bath?

09:59.865 --> 10:01.766
Sean and Probie
are in the locker room.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.337
I bet they're just dying
to take a bath with you.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.950
Excuse me. Hey, do you know how
much longer it's going to be?

10:17.985 --> 10:20.820
- I'll go back and check for you.
- Thank you.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.599
The doctor will see you now.

10:35.501 --> 10:39.005
I'm telling you, Doc. She totally
undressed me with her eyes.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.475
I'm surprised that's all
she did. What do you mean?

10:42.842 --> 10:46.846
Well, I tell you this in confidence
since you're a friend of the family's.

10:46.881 --> 10:49.415
Diana's got a rep for sleeping
with her patients.

10:49.450 --> 10:51.317
That's why we call her
"Dirty Diana."

10:51.684 --> 10:53.686
No way.
So I got a shot?

10:54.153 --> 10:57.123
Anyone with a penis and a pulse
has got a shot with Dirty Diana.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.358
And on that note, would you
stand up for me, please?

11:01.193 --> 11:04.530
Now just relax a minute. I need
to apply this gel to the testicles.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.633
Oh, is, uh--
is that really necessary?

11:07.867 --> 11:10.236
Well, it allows us to get a good
reading from the ultrasound.

11:10.271 --> 11:12.538
Sorry, you know,
I'm just a little--

11:14.874 --> 11:16.876
It's okay.
Just take a deep breath.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.381
Dirty Diana.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.885
She's probably had sex
in every room in this hospital,

11:25.920 --> 11:28.187
including this one.

11:28.387 --> 11:30.356
You being a firefighter,

11:30.690 --> 11:34.760
I'd say you got a damn good shot
at getting a piece of that.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.602
Um, everything okay?

11:44.370 --> 11:47.840
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Don't worry about it.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.710
It's okay.

11:52.078 --> 11:55.581
That's right. Get all that
hoity-toity furniture out of here.

11:56.082 --> 11:59.585
You know what we need? We need
row on row of deluxe La-Z-Boys.

11:59.620 --> 12:01.954
And LCD's on the wall.
Big as you got.

12:02.254 --> 12:05.324
Line the walls. That way we can watch
every game ever played at any given moment.

12:05.825 --> 12:08.961
- Good idea.
- Consider it done.

12:09.428 --> 12:12.229
Hey. The renovations are
already under way, huh?

12:12.264 --> 12:14.467
- Well, Jenny would've wanted it that way.
- Oh, yeah.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.334
Where'd the pussy go? Been asking
that question since high school.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.740
Well, we put all the cats in a separate
wing at the end of the apartment.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.676
Jeffrey looks after them,
pretty much keeps to himself.

12:23.711 --> 12:25.711
Yeah. Out of sight,
out of mind, huh?

12:26.078 --> 12:28.114
Yeah. Dad, I got
a little surprise for you.

12:28.149 --> 12:31.817
This is my lucky week.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.153
Hey, Daddy.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.022
What, no hug?

12:37.256 --> 12:41.827
I haven't seen you in many years,
Peggy Sue. I hardly recognized you.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.263
I hate that name.
Why you gotta call me that name?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.031
My name's Maggie.
I don't like that name.

12:46.298 --> 12:48.834
It's the name your mother
and I gave you.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.770
I don't care.
It's a stupid name.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.270
Just because you and mom
were a Buddy Holly fan...

12:53.305 --> 12:56.308
doesn't mean I gotta be stuck with
that name for the rest of my life.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.645
Can I get a drink, please? Vodka. Right.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.614
Vodka it is.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.316
Is the SWAT team gonna descend
on me if I light up in here?

13:04.351 --> 13:07.852
No, it's fine.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, Mags.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.421
-Here you go.
- Hey, thanks. So how you been, Dad?

13:10.456 --> 13:14.326
- Like you don't know.
-Your old man's old lady passed away.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.027
Yeah, I know.
Mom, she died last year.

13:17.062 --> 13:20.032
- No, no. His new old lady, Mrs. "Nig."
- You married a black chick?

13:20.466 --> 13:25.871
Her name was Mrs. Ng,
Jenny Ng. And she was Korean.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.140
Oh, a Chink broad,
real step up.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.644
So I presume, uh, you're here
to get a slice of the pie.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.079
What are you talking about?
I came here to see my family.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.847
Why, was she, uh--
Was she rich?

13:36.882 --> 13:39.018
You think I bought all this
on my fireman's pension?

13:39.351 --> 13:41.687
Mikey, Mikey,
take it easy on the girl.

13:41.987 --> 13:45.057
She never even had the decency to
come to her own mother's funeral.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.027
Yet here she is trying
to put her hand in my pockets,

13:48.062 --> 13:49.962
which ain't gonna
happen never!

13:50.362 --> 13:51.931
How dare you!

13:52.431 --> 13:54.867
It's not my fault I got locked
up the night before her funeral.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.702
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You got locked up?

13:57.036 --> 14:00.539
It was a bar fight. She had it
coming to her, the stupid cooz.

14:00.574 --> 14:03.810
You picking up
this odor, Teddy?

14:03.845 --> 14:07.046
It's the smell
of, uh, horseshit,

14:07.546 --> 14:11.016
compliments of my beautiful
daughter, Peggy Sue.

14:11.383 --> 14:14.351
It's Maggie,
you stupid old fart.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.388
To hell with you,
and to hell with this,

14:16.889 --> 14:20.392
and to hell with your stupid
hoity-toity Park Avenue apartment.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.896
And to hell with your
stupid, dead Chink wife.

14:23.931 --> 14:27.366
Tommy, will you take
me to the hotel? Sure.

14:29.735 --> 14:32.304
Well, she's mellowed.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.779
Hey.
Oh. Hey, Jerry.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.782
I'm sorry. I thought you
were working a double.

14:43.817 --> 14:46.684
No, I got out of it.
You okay?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.186
Yeah, I'm a bit worn out.
I'll bet.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.590
Do you, uh, want me to
put a plate in the oven?

14:51.625 --> 14:54.260
No, no.
I'm not hungry.

14:54.295 --> 14:56.861
So, uh, how's my girl?

14:56.896 --> 15:00.197
She's had some
good moments today.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.002
But she kept talking about
a little girl-- Sherri, Shari?

15:04.303 --> 15:06.272
- Shelly?
- You know her?

15:08.641 --> 15:10.576
No. Uh, some nonsense,
I guess.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.511
Well, look at
the bright side.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.947
All your mistakes today
will be forgotten tomorrow.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.351
Oh, you're
a good husband, Jerry.

15:19.618 --> 15:22.588
And a good man.
You'll get through this.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.895
I should go look in on her.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.665
Okay.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.469
Hey.

15:38.504 --> 15:41.440
What are you doing up here?
You should be asleep by now.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.313
I was dreaming about Shelly.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.518
Jeannie, Shelly is--
She was all grown up.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.818
She was beautiful.

15:54.853 --> 15:58.622
And we had grandbabies.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.527
A whole bunch of them
crawling all over the house.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.864
And you were picking them up
and kissing their little bellies.

16:05.899 --> 16:08.100
And they were laughing.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.303
We were all laughing.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.708
Sweetie,
that was just a dream.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.111
Shelly died a long time ago,
when she was just a baby herself.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.513
I know,

16:22.548 --> 16:26.552
but I don't mind
dreaming about her.

16:26.587 --> 16:28.420
It means I remember.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.225
And if I can remember her
after all these years,

16:33.260 --> 16:35.444
never mentioning her name,

16:35.479 --> 16:37.629
it means
I'll remember you...

16:37.997 --> 16:41.000
and Peter,

16:41.367 --> 16:43.769
and I can take you
with me when I go.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.037
Go? You're not
going anywhere.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.408
I'm so sorry for
what I've put you through.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.211
I've been such an
embarrassment. Hey, hey, hey.

16:52.246 --> 16:54.680
Uh-uh.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.050
You don't ever have to
apologize to me for anything.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.886
Things may be muddled
most of the time,

17:02.921 --> 17:06.224
but I'm clear in mind when
I tell you now that I love you.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.330
I love you despite all
the things I hate about you,

17:12.564 --> 17:17.536
all the lousy, unspeakable
things you've done.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.040
All your terrible flaws
are forgiven.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.978
Did you hear me,
you old fool?

17:27.378 --> 17:29.181
I love you.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.453
Oh, I love you too, babe.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.594
I love you too.

17:45.931 --> 17:47.499
Want a refill?

17:53.639 --> 17:57.107
So,

17:57.142 --> 17:59.109
why'd you come back?

17:59.144 --> 18:02.579
Not you too.
I'm just saying, Mags.

18:02.614 --> 18:06.118
Yeah. I figured you and me were always close,
had a special bond, backed each other up.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.585
I know. I know.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.587
I figure the only reason
why you like me is...

18:10.622 --> 18:12.591
I'm the one person the family
hates worse than you.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.260
There might be a sliver
of truth to that,

18:16.295 --> 18:20.833
but you know I love you, Mags,
and Johnny likes you.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.002
Don't pump sunshine
up my ass, Tommy.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.805
Johnny's scared shitless
of me, always was.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.807
Uncle Teddy tolerates me, and,

18:29.308 --> 18:31.143
well, it's obvious
how Daddy feels.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.981
Hey, you know,
I know I'm no saint.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.901
I'm spiteful, angry,
untrustworthy,

18:38.936 --> 18:41.320
hateful and dishonest,
just like Dad.

18:41.355 --> 18:43.655
But I'm trying
to get better.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.622
Me too.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.160
Yeah? I can tell.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.462
Who decorated this place,
Elton John?

18:50.662 --> 18:53.832
No, I-- I kind of left that all
up to Janet this time around.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.967
Well, it looks like your birds
flew the coop. Well, those are--

18:57.002 --> 19:00.439
We never really had birds. They're,
um, what's the word? Decorative.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.276
Mm, they're queer. And that
means they're expensive.

19:05.677 --> 19:08.145
Well, you know,

19:08.180 --> 19:10.048
Mrs. "Nig" was loaded,

19:10.349 --> 19:12.382
and, uh, you know, Dad's
the sole beneficiary, so--

19:12.417 --> 19:15.385
Jesus, Tommy, I thought you might
have brightened up over the years.

19:15.420 --> 19:19.358
I mean, did you ever consider if that money
doesn't come down? Did you ever consider that?

19:19.393 --> 19:23.362
Yeah, I've considered it, but, you
know, I mean, Janet's in this new kick.

19:23.397 --> 19:25.864
It's like, she wants
to live in the now.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.200
You know, be in the now.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.786
Then do that.
Live in the now.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.038
Be in the now.
That's how I live.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.110
Thank you.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.347
Oh, thank you.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.853
Perfect.
Thank you very much.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.155
Thank you.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.689
Come on. I'm having a hard time
believing this isn't helping.

19:52.724 --> 19:56.444
- You gone blind or something?
- I'm in love with Laura, Sean. Can't you see that?

19:56.479 --> 20:00.165
Yes, yes, I can. But what I can't see,
is you limiting yourself to one girl, bro.

20:00.566 --> 20:02.599
Like, I don't-- I don't
think you got it in you.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.637
A'ight. Fair enough. Maybe you're
right. But I'll tell you this Sean-O--

20:05.672 --> 20:08.106
I've climbed every mountain,
I've been to every valley,

20:08.141 --> 20:10.040
and still, I haven't found
what I'm looking for.

20:10.075 --> 20:13.545
Wow. Have you checked where
the streets have no name, Bono?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.512
You know what
I'm talking about, asshole.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.015
Yes. For once in my life, I do.
And you know what?

20:18.050 --> 20:21.820
If you ask me, I think she's standing over
there in stiletto heels and a mesh thong. Hi!

20:21.855 --> 20:25.591
He'll never change.
You don't know that.

20:25.626 --> 20:27.859
Oh, Laura, come on.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.078
If you didn't work together,
you might at least...

20:30.113 --> 20:32.062
be able to kid yourself
into believing he could,

20:32.097 --> 20:35.100
but, I mean, you're right
on top of each other like that.

20:35.135 --> 20:37.936
There's not even room for lies.
It's just unhealthy.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.771
Take what happened when
you came with me to N.A.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.407
You came along, but you weren't
really there to support me.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.374
You were there for
yourself. That's not true.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.746
And that is okay. All right, I admit,
there was wall-to-wall pussy there.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.449
You had every right, you had
every reason, to go trolling.

20:50.484 --> 20:52.918
I pulled the same thing
on you a dozen times.

20:52.953 --> 20:54.885
Really? When?

20:54.920 --> 20:57.389
Remember your cousin's
graduation party-- the hot one?

20:57.756 --> 21:00.125
You banged
my sweet cousin Angie?

21:00.160 --> 21:02.926
No.
Oh, Jesus.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.630
I banged your sister.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.097
Missy?

21:07.132 --> 21:09.401
Franco, she was like 17.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.036
I know. I waited a year.

21:13.071 --> 21:16.675
You okay?
Uh, yeah. I guess.

21:16.975 --> 21:21.813
He's got under my skin 'cause I see
that he's trying to change and to grow.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.483
And he just keeps
getting in his own way.

21:24.518 --> 21:27.084
You know, maybe that's
why I love him.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.122
Oh, God. Sorry. No, you
don't. You don't love him.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.991
You love what you hope he'll
be, but he'll never be that.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.411
He's not gonna change.

21:35.446 --> 21:37.761
No, you don't know that.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.149
See? This is what I'm talking about.
Most guys don't even have a conscience.

21:41.184 --> 21:44.411
That's why we need a good woman around
to balance out the nasty shit you do.

21:44.446 --> 21:47.639
That's why I'm in love with Laura. She
was there for me, through everything.

21:47.674 --> 21:51.108
Through my injury,
Keela's accident, my rehab.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.578
There was nothing in it
for her but making me happy.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.783
- Huh.
- I'll see you tomorrow, man.

21:58.016 --> 22:01.453
Hey, wait, Franco. Will you, uh,
slip me a couple hundred bucks?

22:01.488 --> 22:04.890
A couple hundred clams? For what?
This cute blonde over there--

22:04.925 --> 22:06.992
She does this thing
with her feet. It's like--

22:07.027 --> 22:08.827
All right, man.

22:15.367 --> 22:18.402
It's-- I mean, it's not like I
meant to get a hard-on, you know?

22:18.437 --> 22:21.239
He's telling me this sexy story while
he was touching my junk, you know?

22:21.274 --> 22:24.308
Okay, okay, I get the picture.
Yeah, it was really awkward.

22:24.343 --> 22:28.046
He's even kind of friends with my dad. He
asked me to have dinner with him next week.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.183
- What? He what? What did you say?
- I'm not really sure.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.519
I was so confused and embarrassed. It
was like he seduced me or something.

22:34.554 --> 22:38.223
Well, tell me
you said no, Mike, please.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.525
- Mike?
- I felt like I owed him something.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.429
Okay, you know what? Now you've entered the
final frontier. Congratulations, Gaylord.

22:45.464 --> 22:49.334
Come on. I'm in a real bind with this doctor.
Not to mention the fact I might have ball cancer.

22:49.735 --> 22:53.505
Chief's gonna give me an hour off to go back
and get my test results. What should I do?

22:53.739 --> 22:56.208
Uh, bring flowers.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.180
Careful. Hey, hey, hey. What the hell?

23:02.414 --> 23:05.417
- What the hell is this shit?
- Just a few pieces. Franco put it on the card. You said.

23:05.951 --> 23:08.053
- You're good for it, right?
- I told you guys to frame it up,

23:08.088 --> 23:10.088
not go and raid Bally's
for Christ's sake.

23:10.422 --> 23:11.888
Hey.
Hi.

23:11.923 --> 23:13.390
What's going on?
Hey, Janet.

23:13.425 --> 23:16.928
Hi. Building a gym, huh? Yeah. I was
just telling these guys what you told me.

23:16.963 --> 23:19.363
The time we have left--
let's make the most of it.

23:19.398 --> 23:23.001
Where's the, uh-- the rowing machines and
the treadmills I told you to get, Garrity?

23:23.036 --> 23:24.903
Uh, we ordered them right? Yeah.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.773
Oh, okay. I just brought a few
wedding invitation samples to look at.

23:28.306 --> 23:31.810
Honey, I think I told you, just look at the
most expensive ones, the prettiest ones--

23:31.845 --> 23:34.112
Wait a second. Wedding?
Is Colleen getting married?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.947
She's a little young for that,
don't you think?

23:36.448 --> 23:38.917
You're a piece of work. No, Tommy
and me. We're renewing our vows.

23:39.284 --> 23:41.184
Oh, wow. I didn't realize
you had to do that.

23:41.219 --> 23:44.122
You don't have to do it.
We, you know, want to do it.

23:44.157 --> 23:46.542
Yeah, but, honey,
you didn't tell them?

23:46.577 --> 23:48.927
I was gonna surprise them.
Surprise.

23:49.127 --> 23:51.596
Congratulations.
It's a surprise.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.097
Go in the kitchen. We can get
some privacy. That's great.

23:54.132 --> 23:57.135
Garrity, order those free weights.
I want those here tomorrow.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.336
Yeah, you got it.
Free weights.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.339
He just said he wanted us
to save money.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.176
Where the hell am I
gonna get free weights?

24:09.314 --> 24:11.683
Michael Silletti?

24:13.552 --> 24:15.520
Michael Silletti?

24:17.489 --> 24:19.456
Hi. I'm Michael.

24:19.491 --> 24:23.895
I'm seeing here there were some
irregularities with the equipment yesterday.

24:23.930 --> 24:27.399
My equipment?
The medical equipment.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.734
Oh. We're gonna have to
repeat the examination.

24:30.235 --> 24:34.239
What? No. I'm not doin' it. It won't take long.
They'll have your diagnosis within the hour.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.042
You know what? Take the nut.
One's plenty for me.

24:37.077 --> 24:39.744
Um, I'm not sure
I understand.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.714
You can tell Dr. Levy I'm not
doing the examination again.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.716
Well, Dr. Levy was called
away on an emergency,

24:45.150 --> 24:47.219
so Dr. Newman
will be doing the honors.

24:47.719 --> 24:49.688
Hello, Michael.
Are we all set?

24:49.723 --> 24:51.656
Yeah.
Right this way.

24:54.659 --> 24:59.598
These are for you. Thanks.
I'll put them back in the vase.

24:59.633 --> 25:01.998
Hey.
Hey, what's up man?

25:02.033 --> 25:06.605
Listen, I, uh-- I've been thinking, uh, about
your nuts. And I think it's gonna be okay.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.840
Look what happened to Lance
Armstrong. He turned out well.

25:09.207 --> 25:11.610
Yeah, but was that before
or after he landed on the moon?

25:11.877 --> 25:16.414
No,LanceArmstrong-- the guy that won the
Tour de France, like, 26 times in a row.

25:17.382 --> 25:19.384
Whoa. Holy shit, bro.

25:19.885 --> 25:22.854
You don't even know what the Tour De France
is, do you? I want to say, wine tasting?

25:22.889 --> 25:24.890
Jesus Christ, Mike.
It's a bike race, you know?

25:25.390 --> 25:27.759
The bike race that he won after they
de-balled him. Don't you watch ESPN?

25:27.794 --> 25:30.026
Yeah, but I don't pay attention
to bike races.

25:30.061 --> 25:32.697
Well, maybe you should, seeing as
your bike may be losing a wheel.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.000
You know what I mean?
I'm not losing a wheel.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.434
You're not?
No.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.571
Really? You got cleared?
Uh, it's just a hydrocele.

25:39.606 --> 25:42.439
Oh, what's that?
It's like, um, this little--

25:42.474 --> 25:46.643
You have no idea, do you? No,
but I get to keep the kids.

25:46.678 --> 25:50.048
Hey, there you go. That's good. No, I
didn't want to say anything, you know?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.951
I mean, getting one of your balls
lopped off-- that's like a freak show.

25:53.418 --> 25:55.887
Hey, what's going on with the other
thing? You let that guy down easy?

25:56.254 --> 25:58.290
Yeah, he wasn't there.
But you know the hot doctor?

25:58.325 --> 26:00.793
The one that he used
to seduce me with?

26:00.828 --> 26:03.261
Yeah. She gave me another examination.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.096
Nice. What happened? It's more
like whatdidn't happen, you know?

26:06.131 --> 26:09.134
Let's just say I didn't respond the
way I did the last time with him.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.969
Yikes. Whoa.
Yeah.

26:11.269 --> 26:14.339
Sean?
Huh?

26:14.773 --> 26:16.908
You think I'm gay, dude?

26:17.409 --> 26:20.612
Uh, no, no, no. You're just-- You were probably
just nervous. Well, yeah. I was nervous.

26:21.112 --> 26:24.049
Plus, I rubbed one out beforehand, so
I didn't have a round in the chamber.

26:24.084 --> 26:26.383
Oh, smart move. You know,
works every time. Yeah.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.921
No, man, we bust your balls about being
gay 'cause you hang out with a lot of fags,

26:29.956 --> 26:32.875
and you work out with them,
and you go dancing,

26:32.910 --> 26:35.759
and, you know, quite
frankly, look at your shirt.

26:35.794 --> 26:39.598
But you're a real guy's guy. You're a
pussy hound if you really think about it.

26:40.065 --> 26:42.766
Red river! Red river!
Red river!

26:42.801 --> 26:46.736
Ladies and gentlemen!

26:46.771 --> 26:48.773
Yeah! What do you think? You like that?

26:49.140 --> 26:52.310
I knew it was gonna be funny. When you
said that thing about not getting a hard-on?

26:52.345 --> 26:54.646
Come on. That's, like,
hilarious. You are such a homo.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.582
- We figured, if you
were gonna be the catcher,

26:57.949 --> 27:00.585
-we'd get the wig-- make it a little easier
for the probie. - Whose idea was this?

27:00.952 --> 27:02.971
Oh, you didn't think
that was just gonna go away?

27:03.006 --> 27:04.990
What do you think about
having a gay firefighter?

27:05.025 --> 27:07.859
Hey, Chief.
Telephone call.

27:10.662 --> 27:13.129
That thing kinda
looks like you.

27:13.164 --> 27:17.502
Yeah, what do you got? She's
locked herself in the bathroom.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.136
How long?
An hour.

27:20.171 --> 27:23.440
You can't get her
out yourself?

27:23.475 --> 27:25.477
I don't know what else to do.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.846
All right. I'll be
there as soon as I can.

27:34.686 --> 27:39.524
Those tuna steaks look so yummy.
Yeah. How do you like yours?

27:39.559 --> 27:41.493
I like them pink, very pink.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.534
Will you get this, T?

27:50.068 --> 27:53.505
- "T"?
- What?

27:53.705 --> 27:55.623
You called me T.

27:55.658 --> 27:57.542
Oh.

27:58.043 --> 27:59.809
I am sorry.
I didn't mean to.

27:59.844 --> 28:03.114
- You think it's funny?
- No, I think it's a slip of the tongue.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.051
Well, you're a damn riot.
You're goddamn hysterical.

28:06.086 --> 28:07.951
Please, you're overreacting.

28:07.986 --> 28:12.891
You know what's funny is that I
think I'm allergic to carrots now.

28:13.224 --> 28:16.227
It's like when I eat
them, I-- What the hell?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.697
Why don't you invite Tommy
over? He can give us some tips,

28:19.064 --> 28:21.232
because it's so hard
for me to satisfy you.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.401
Don't. Maybe we could
take him to bed with us.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.970
Stop it! Huh? Every
guy's fantasy, right?

28:26.404 --> 28:28.673
Cut it out. Well, you're
just full of piss and vinegar.

28:28.907 --> 28:30.825
I said cut the shit!

28:30.860 --> 28:32.744
Move! Get off!
Bitch.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.027
Why don't we call Tommy up,
you stupid little bitch? Huh?

28:51.062 --> 28:54.766
Maybe I could watch you suck him
off, huh? Would you like that?

29:03.908 --> 29:06.211
Maybe you could watch me
get it from behind.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.012
You'd like that, huh?

29:09.948 --> 29:12.417
Get off me!
Get off me!

29:17.956 --> 29:20.825
You bitch.

29:21.126 --> 29:25.463
Don't say a goddamn word.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.307
I got a package here
for a Sheila Keefe.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.610
I'll sign for it.

29:39.878 --> 29:42.078
Working out, huh?

29:42.113 --> 29:44.816
Oh, yeah.

29:49.788 --> 29:53.658
Oh, look. The new gardening
set you ordered just came in.

29:53.693 --> 29:58.496
Fine.

30:28.526 --> 30:30.528
Rose?

30:33.031 --> 30:34.998
Jeannie?

30:35.033 --> 30:37.068
Anybody down here?

30:38.036 --> 30:40.038
Rose?

30:41.039 --> 30:43.439
Hey, Rose.

30:43.474 --> 30:46.844
Big emergency,
I can't get in touch.

30:46.879 --> 30:50.215
Rose, didn't you hear me
calling you?

30:50.250 --> 30:52.083
Rose.

30:52.383 --> 30:57.455
My husband, toward the end of his life,
said a lot of ugly horrible things to me.

30:57.490 --> 31:00.458
You knew it didn't mean anything,
you knew it came out of nowhere,

31:00.493 --> 31:04.012
but some of the time,
it still stung you.

31:04.047 --> 31:07.532
On his worst day,
nothing ever like that.

31:07.899 --> 31:10.468
What are you talking about?
What did she say to you?

31:10.503 --> 31:12.302
Jeannie?
Jeannie.

31:12.337 --> 31:16.241
Jeannie, sweetie, come on.
Please, open the door.

31:16.276 --> 31:18.509
Jeannie, come on.
Open the door now!

31:18.710 --> 31:21.195
- Jerry!
- Open the door!

31:21.230 --> 31:23.681
- Jerry!
- What? Ah, shit!

31:26.885 --> 31:30.138
Oh, Christ! Call 911!

31:30.173 --> 31:32.783
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

31:32.818 --> 31:35.256
Oh, Jeannie! Easy!

31:35.291 --> 31:37.695
Come on! Hurry!

31:37.929 --> 31:40.930
Oh, baby, come on.
Hold on.

31:40.965 --> 31:44.936
Stay with me, sweetie.
Stay with me. Come on.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.438
Hold in there.
Hold in there.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.440
Rose!

31:54.445 --> 31:56.748
You know, I think Colleen
wants to major...

31:57.248 --> 31:59.215
in African-American studies.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.718
I think it's
an interesting choice.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.255
Bowling Green supposedly
has a great program.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.759
And when the other two leave for college,
it will just be the two of us again,

32:07.794 --> 32:09.726
like it was
in the beginning.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.263
and we can do all the things that
we dreamed of, like traveling.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.230
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

32:14.265 --> 32:16.733
You can retire early,
and we'll use your pension...

32:16.768 --> 32:21.522
to go to all of the places we've
never been-- Africa, Egypt, Japan.

32:21.557 --> 32:26.277
Oh, and I talked to Lorraine about
buying a house down the shore.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.244
Nothing expensive.

32:28.279 --> 32:31.783
Just someplace that we can get away
from the city every now and then.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.287
Tommy?

32:39.057 --> 32:41.392
What do you think?

32:50.501 --> 32:53.469
Hey, kids!
Hey, Dad. Hey.

32:53.504 --> 32:57.008
What's going on? What the
hell is she doing here?

32:57.043 --> 32:59.475
Okay, okay.
Now listen to me, okay?

32:59.510 --> 33:02.513
She's changed, all right? Nobody
changes, Tommy. You know that.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.480
I changed.
I quit drinking.

33:04.515 --> 33:07.018
That doesn't mean you've changed.
That means you're a pussy.

33:07.518 --> 33:10.388
Great. Just talk to her,
please, all right? Come on, Mags.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.724
I don't know what you expect
to get out of this.

33:14.692 --> 33:18.696
No expectations, Daddy. I just--
I just need to be back in the fold.

33:19.197 --> 33:22.900
You know, your stepmother
was a real bitch.

33:22.935 --> 33:25.301
You remind me of her.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.673
The Chink?
Yeah, the Chink.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.542
Now come on over here.

33:37.548 --> 33:42.020
You know, I don't like
getting so rough with you.

33:42.520 --> 33:46.024
It's just, you get me
so angry sometimes.

33:46.524 --> 33:51.279
I feel like I have to live
up to that asshole, Tommy.

33:51.314 --> 33:55.425
I mean, what did he ever do
that was so great, you know?

33:55.460 --> 33:59.537
All he ever did was abandon
you when you needed him most,

33:59.572 --> 34:02.540
and all you do is talk
about how wonderful he is.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.045
But that's no excuse.

34:10.547 --> 34:14.052
Here.
Does that feel better?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.525
Good girl.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.563
I'll get the ice.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.737
Hey.
Hey.

34:34.772 --> 34:38.775
Come on in. I was just
finishing up some stuff.

34:38.811 --> 34:40.745
You want a beer?

34:41.079 --> 34:45.149
No, I'm good. What
happened? You hurt yourself?

34:45.184 --> 34:47.485
No, I'm fine.
Well, tell me.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.286
Let me see.

34:55.326 --> 34:57.829
Jesus Christ.
F-Bomb?

34:58.262 --> 34:59.797
It's my fault.

35:00.331 --> 35:02.700
I pressed him about
letting me go. He got upset.

35:02.967 --> 35:06.471
You know, I would really, really,
really like to talk to this guy.

35:06.938 --> 35:10.608
He'll kill you, Kenny.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.981
$26,340, okay?

35:19.016 --> 35:21.284
It's all about money with
these scumbags? There.

35:21.319 --> 35:24.021
- Where did you get this?
- I told you, I had it lying around.

35:24.056 --> 35:26.724
This is everything you have.
No, you know what?

35:26.958 --> 35:30.528
You take it, you give it to
him, he let's you go, okay?

35:30.563 --> 35:33.131
And then it's just
you and me, together.

35:37.835 --> 35:40.338
Thank you.

35:44.008 --> 35:48.513
Looks like everybody is finally here,
so let's get right into it, shall we?

35:48.548 --> 35:50.813
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:50.848 --> 35:54.886
Mrs. Ng has left a sizable account
here in Michael Gavin's name.

35:54.921 --> 35:57.787
All right.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.790
The remainder of her cash and
liquidated assets will be spent...

36:00.825 --> 36:04.162
seeing that her beloved cats live the
rest of their lives in the utmost comfort.

36:04.197 --> 36:08.332
She's leaving money to
the cats? What a fruitcake!

36:08.699 --> 36:11.734
A substantial piece of that
will be donated...

36:11.769 --> 36:15.540
to a cause we all know was close
to Jenny's heart-- cat cancer.

36:15.575 --> 36:19.644
Uh, don't keep us in
suspense, pal. How much?

36:21.412 --> 36:23.514
- $50,000.
- For the cats.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.685
The bulk of the estate
goes to the cats.

36:28.052 --> 36:29.587
50,000 is your share.
Whoa. Whoa.

36:30.087 --> 36:33.925
Hold on a second here, pal. You told me
that Dad was getting a sizable payout.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.661
To most people,
50,000 is exactly that.

36:37.061 --> 36:38.995
We're still cutting up
that 50 grand though, right?

36:39.030 --> 36:45.002
You mean to tell me, she's leaving
$60 million to the goddamn cats?

36:45.037 --> 36:47.071
And the cancer foundation.

36:47.106 --> 36:49.106
- I got cancer.
- You do?

36:49.407 --> 36:51.842
- I'm pretty sure.
- Cat cancer.

36:53.110 --> 36:54.877
And that's it?
Uh, not quite.

36:54.912 --> 36:59.984
Jeffrey has compiled a list of charges you've
accrued over the days since Jenny's passing.

37:00.019 --> 37:04.021
You owe the estate
just over $20,000.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.457
We can work out
an installment plan.

37:06.492 --> 37:08.891
I'm outta here.

37:08.926 --> 37:11.645
I'll kill you,
you little shit!

37:11.680 --> 37:14.365
$50,000?
That's my money! No!

37:14.732 --> 37:16.750
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy,
leave it alone.

37:16.785 --> 37:18.769
I'll kill you and all your cats! Teddy!

37:22.773 --> 37:24.740
You want to see
my new trick, Dad?

37:24.775 --> 37:28.679
I'd love to see your new trick, but what
did I tell you about putting the helmet on?

37:28.714 --> 37:30.046
Okay.
Okay?

37:30.081 --> 37:32.048
Okay.
All right.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.086
Go in the house, grab your
helmet, all right? Okay.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.975
You all pumped for this wedding,
or what? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:41.010 --> 37:43.861
Yeah, pretty pumped.
It's gonna be nice, right?

37:43.896 --> 37:46.030
I don't know, man.

37:47.431 --> 37:48.933
Sometimes she starts
talking about stuff...

37:49.433 --> 37:52.303
like she's got a blueprint
for the next 20 or 30 years.

37:52.637 --> 37:54.670
And it just seems
so far away to me, man.

37:54.705 --> 37:57.975
And it's not-- It's like two different
mind-sets, you know what I mean?

37:58.276 --> 38:01.345
Thinking a week ahead is hard
for me, you know what I mean?

38:01.380 --> 38:05.116
Especially feeling happy
about stuff.

38:07.485 --> 38:11.989
Like the other day, man, at this wedding
shop we went to, she came out in this dress.

38:12.024 --> 38:15.259
It's-- Man!

38:17.028 --> 38:20.364
As soon as I see her
in that thing, I'm lost.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.199
She's a gorgeous girl.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.172
You know what I mean?

38:43.854 --> 38:47.858
Hey, big boy. Hey, did you
pass Connor on your way out?

38:47.893 --> 38:49.794
No, I thought he was
out here with you.

38:50.194 --> 38:52.663
Connor?

38:55.066 --> 38:57.034
Connor?

39:00.371 --> 39:03.040
Connor?

39:17.688 --> 39:19.989
Get in the truck.
Tommy?

39:20.024 --> 39:23.394
- Get in the truck! Get in the truck, now!
- What happened?

39:23.429 --> 39:25.663
Oh, my God.
Open the door.

39:25.698 --> 39:27.863
He's fine.
He's fine, okay?

39:27.898 --> 39:30.150
He doesn't look fine.
Oh, my God!

39:30.185 --> 39:32.403
He's okay. Put this on. Oh, my God!

39:32.438 --> 39:34.972
Calm down.
Watch your legs.

39:37.408 --> 39:41.412
Tommy, he's not breathing.
He's fine!

39:41.447 --> 39:45.448
Open the door!
God!

39:45.483 --> 39:49.353
Just stay calm, okay?
Just stay calm.

40:30.594 --> 40:34.632
All the wild horses

40:39.703 --> 40:43.107
All the wild horses

40:48.446 --> 40:52.917
Tethered with tears
in their eyes

40:59.390 --> 41:05.663
May no man's touch
ever tame them

41:07.164 --> 41:12.603
May no man's reins
ever chain them

41:14.505 --> 41:18.509
And may no man's weight

41:18.544 --> 41:22.513
Ever defrayed your soul

41:26.817 --> 41:30.321
And as for the clouds

41:34.325 --> 41:39.330
Just let them roll

41:44.001 --> 41:46.303
Roll away

41:47.605 --> 41:51.108
Roll away

41:55.045 --> 41:58.516
As for the clouds

42:02.520 --> 42:06.991
Just let them roll

42:12.029 --> 42:14.782
Roll

42:14.817 --> 42:17.535
Away

42:19.537 --> 42:22.406
Roll

42:22.740 --> 42:25.309
Away

44:20.357 --> 44:21.759
Cloudland.
