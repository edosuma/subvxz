JERRY:
Oh, my god. No. No.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.175
- I told you.
- Hold on.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.177
Will you please...

00:11.261 --> 00:12.970
not marry me?
I chose Veronica.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.222
- What?!
- Yes!

00:14.306 --> 00:16.224
- Hold it.
- Why would he chose Veronica?

00:16.308 --> 00:17.892
Because he loves her?

00:17.976 --> 00:19.310
Well, if it's any
consolation, Summer,

00:19.395 --> 00:21.145
none of it mattered
and the entire show was stupid.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.605
Okay, I've got an idea, Rick.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.607
You show us your concept
of good TV,

00:24.692 --> 00:26.526
and we'll crap all over that.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.195
Thought you'd never ask.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.446
Hey.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.448
Oh, cool. ls that
crystallized xanthanite?

It conducts electrons
across dimensions.

00:36.412 --> 00:37.829
The important thing being,

00:37.913 --> 00:39.789
I just upgraded
our cable package

00:39.873 --> 00:42.041
with programing from every
conceivable reality.

00:42.126 --> 00:43.626
Wait. Does that mean
we get Showtime Extreme?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.420
How about Showtime Extreme
in a world

00:45.504 --> 00:47.088
where man evolved from corn?

00:47.172 --> 00:49.132
We're not so different.
We're both corn of action.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.134
Yeah, but one of us
is dead corn!

Boring.

Summer [burps] you just
spent [burps] three months

choose a fake wife.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.477
So, what, it'd be better
if the people were corn?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.101

Jerry, you don't get it.

This is infinite TV

01:03.439 --> 01:05.148
Look.
- This shit is delicious.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.192
A movie about a guy eating shit.

A violent antique show.

It's a pleasure to have you.

No, the other thing!
Go back.

- All right, Jerry.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.463
When you're right, you're right.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.839
Now I'm hooked.

And there's so many TVs,
microwaves, radios, I think.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.687
I can't... I'm not 100% sure
what we have here in stock

aren't too low.

anything, either.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.455
Did I mention that?

04:07.539 --> 04:10.041
But that's not as catchy as
having ants in your eyes,

04:10.125 --> 04:12.668
so that always goes, you know,
off by the wayside.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.837

It's a very rare disease.

a different timeline.

achieved our dreams,

there's a chance
you weren't even born.

you bothered to have me.

makes a sneeze noise.

Huh, seems like TV
from other dimensions

05:48.557 --> 05:50.391
has a somewhat looser
feel to it.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.227
Yeah, it's got an almost
improvisational tone.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.855

Two brothers in a van,

as they could

06:04.031 --> 06:05.865
And then a giant tornado came.

And that's when things got
knocked into 12th gear.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.460

from t-tomatoes.

Old women are coming,
and they're also in the movie.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.444
And they're gonna come

06:43.528 --> 06:45.988
and cross attack
these two brothers.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.573
But let's get back
to the brothers,

06:47.657 --> 06:50.576
because they're...
they have a strong bond.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.869
You don't want to know
about it here,

06:51.953 --> 06:53.537
but I'll tell you one thing.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.790
The moon... it comes crashing
into Earth.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.750
And what do you do then?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.544
It's two brothers and...
and they're gonna...

07:00.629 --> 07:02.546
It's called "Two Brothers."
"Two Brothers."

[ laughing ] It's just called
"Two Brothers."

07:09.221 --> 07:10.846
I'm taming a lion.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.973
No, wait.
There are film cameras.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.601
I might be a lion tamer
in a movie.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.311
You get the idea.
I work with lions.

Ohh, we're not playing Yahtzee!

07:21.983 --> 07:24.193
We're playing
Chutes and Ladders.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.904
Seems like when I exist,
life gets a little more...

07:26.988 --> 07:28.572
I don't know... predictable?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.616
When two people create
a life together,

07:30.700 --> 07:33.619
they set aside their previous
lives as individuals.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.246
Give me a break.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.998
We're not heroes for having
unprotected sex on prom night.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.333
Oh, I get it.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.502
Now that you know
you could have had it better,

07:41.586 --> 07:43.921
you resent me
for holding you back.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.507
Well, now that we know you think
the tables are turning,

07:46.591 --> 07:48.431
we know you thought
there were unturned tables.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.386
What are you talking about?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.054
All this time, you've been
thinking, "what if that loser,

07:52.139 --> 07:54.348
Jerry, hadn't talked me out
of the abortion?"

07:54.432 --> 07:56.433
- Um...
- Well, now you know.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.560
You'd be a doctor.
Whoop-DE-do.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.228
You'd also be drinking wine
alone

07:59.312 --> 08:01.480
in a house full of exotic birds.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.316
And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht,
banging Kristen Stewart.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.735
You thought about
getting an abortion?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.195
Everyone thinks about it.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.280
Obviously, I'm the version of me
that didn't do it,

08:10.282 --> 08:13.284
so you're welcome.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.952
Yeah, thank you guys so much.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.662
It's a real treat to be
raised by parents

08:16.746 --> 08:18.414
that forced themselves
to be together

08:18.498 --> 08:20.124
instead of being happy.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.293
Hey, do we have any
wafer cookies?

08:22.377 --> 08:23.627
Mmm!

08:23.712 --> 08:24.795
Oh, boy.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.297
Looks like you guys have been
checking out alternate lives

08:26.381 --> 08:28.141
and realizing you don't
have it as good, huh?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.383
That's too bad.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.107
You know, me and Morty
are having a blast.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.720
We just discovered a show
called "Ball Fondlers."

08:32.804 --> 08:34.680
I mean, I don't want to rub it
in or anything,

08:34.764 --> 08:37.683
but you guys clearly backed
the wrong conceptual horse.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.562
[ metal music plays]

08:50.697 --> 08:53.115
- I'm in heaven right now.
- The best day of my life.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.867
So, now what do we do?

08:54.951 --> 08:57.071
That show "Ball Fondlers"
sounded kind of interesting.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.704
- Dad!
- What?!

08:58.788 --> 09:00.998
They're having fun in there.
What do you guys want from me?

09:01.082 --> 09:03.000
Every family on this block
has to wonder

09:03.084 --> 09:04.710
if they're together by choice.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.587
Our family just has
interdimensional goggles

09:06.671 --> 09:09.006
to show us for a fact
that we're not.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.675
- Well, I'm leaving.
- You can't leave. You're 17.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.260
Yeah, and I'm not pregnant.

09:13.345 --> 09:16.222
I'm gonna have better judgment
than you guys had at my age.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.682
I'm gonna move
to the southwest and...

09:18.767 --> 09:21.852
I don't know, do something
with turquoise.

09:21.937 --> 09:25.856
It's "Saturday Night Live,"

09:25.941 --> 09:28.525
starring a piece of toast,

09:28.610 --> 09:30.861
two guys with handlebar
mustaches,

09:30.946 --> 09:33.781
a man painted silver
who makes robot noises,

09:33.865 --> 09:35.616
Gar Ma Nar Nar,

09:35.700 --> 09:38.327
three, um, um, um...

09:38.411 --> 09:40.162
I'll get back to that one,

09:40.247 --> 09:41.872
a hole in the wall

09:41.957 --> 09:44.041
where the men can see it all,

09:44.125 --> 09:48.337
and, returning for his
25th consecutive year,

09:48.421 --> 09:51.757
Bobby Moynihan!

09:51.841 --> 09:53.300
Interesting fun fact...

09:53.385 --> 09:55.886
Moynihan and a piece of toast
hate each other.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.889
Apparently, they've got some
real creative differences.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.307
Hey, are you tired of real doors

10:00.392 --> 10:01.976
cluttering up your house,

10:02.060 --> 10:03.644
where you open them and you
actually go somewhere,

10:03.728 --> 10:05.020
and you go into another room?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.606
Get on down
to Real Fake Doors. That's us.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.066
Fill a whole room up with them.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.317
See, watch.
Check this out.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.443

10:11.528 --> 10:12.569
[ grunts ] Won't open.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.904
[ grunts ] Not this one.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.072
[ grunts ] Not this one.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.156
None of them open.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.866
Fakedoors.com is our website,

10:17.951 --> 10:20.869
so check it out for a lot of
really great deals

10:20.954 --> 10:24.164

10:30.380 --> 10:32.172
Hey, wait a minute, Rick.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.632
I thought this was a commercial.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.342
What's going on?
- Relax, Morty.

10:35.427 --> 10:39.096
Don't... don't worry about it.
Let's just see where this goes.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.223
Step on it!
We all got places to be!

10:41.308 --> 10:43.642
[ honks horn ] Son of a bitch.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.271
Oh, that must be where he lives.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.689
Okay.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.318
RICK:
Huh. He's making himself a sandwich now.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.864
Hey, everybody.
So, this is my house.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.199
Just made a sandwich...
peanut butter and jelly.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.118
Still here, still selling
fake doors.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.244
MORTY:
What?

11:02.329 --> 11:04.288
Oh, my god.
It's still the commercial.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.290
We have fake doors
like you wouldn't believe.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.667
What are you worried about?
Come get fake doors.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.961
Call us up and order
some fake doors today.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.838
Don't even hesitate,
don't even worry,

11:12.922 --> 11:13.922
and don't even...

11:13.965 --> 11:15.090
All right, I'm bored.
Change it.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.925
Wait, wait, Rick.
Hold on, hold on.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.135
That's our slogan.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.429
See it on the bottom
of the screen below our name.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.556
Here's another slogan
right below that one.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.142
What are you worried about?
Come get fake doors.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.144
Get in here quick, get out quicker

11:27.228 --> 11:28.937
with an arm of fake doors in your arms.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.440
Okay, okay, you can change it.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.984
[ yawns]
I hate Mamumanums-days,

11:34.069 --> 11:36.487
and I really could go
for some enchiladas.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.906
MORTY:
Hey, Rick, that's pretty cool.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.825
It's just like Garfield, only
instead it's Gazorpazorpfield.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.536
Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where
those sex robots came from?

11:44.621 --> 11:46.580
Remember that whole thing?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.582
Yeah. Hey, that's a pretty...
pretty...

11:48.666 --> 11:50.125
That's true.
That's right.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.795
Yeah. Let's watch some more
Gazorpazorpfield.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.797
Hey, John.
It's me, Gazorpazorpfield.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.632
Boy fuck you, John,

11:56.716 --> 11:59.385
you fuckin' dumb, stupid idiot.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.388
Come on, Gazorpazorpfield.
Go easy on me, huh?

12:02.472 --> 12:05.182
You dumb, stupid, weak,

12:05.266 --> 12:08.310
pathetic, white, white,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.646
uh... guilt...

12:10.730 --> 12:13.065

12:13.149 --> 12:15.109
piece of human garbage.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.473
Geez, Gazorpazorpfield,
that's...

12:16.528 --> 12:18.070
you know, you're
pretty mean to me,

12:18.154 --> 12:19.321
but that takes the cake.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.989
I don't give a fuck.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.283
I'm Gazorpazorp-fuckin'-field, bitch.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.619
Now give me my
fucking enchiladas.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.913
Hey, Rick, you know, did they
use Bill Murray for this?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.456
Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.916
No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.584
In this reality,
he's still alive.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.420
Oh, okay.
Was his name "Lorenzo Music"?

12:34.504 --> 12:35.963
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.923
He also did the voice of that
one guy from "Ghostbusters,"

12:38.007 --> 12:40.050
which is really strange
because it's the same character

12:40.135 --> 12:41.260
Bill Murray played in the movie.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.719
But then, when they
made the movie,

12:42.804 --> 12:44.847
Bill Murray did the voice
of Gazorpazorp...

12:44.931 --> 12:46.891
- or Garfield, I mean.
- That's pretty cool, Rick.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.767
So all that happened
in this reality, too?

12:48.852 --> 12:49.935
I don't know.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.478
Just making conversation
with you, Morty.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.938
What, you think
I'm a... I'm...

12:53.022 --> 12:55.065
I know everything about
everything?

12:55.150 --> 12:57.234
Did you really talk me
out of the abortion?

12:57.318 --> 13:00.487
Well, we... we blew a tire
on the way to the clinic.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.866
I think, in my head, I was
doing it all for the kids.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.369
And now the first kid is going
to do something with turquoise.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.496
[ sighs ] Which is either
code for crystal meth

13:09.581 --> 13:11.373
or a gateway to it.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.500
So we didn't do
the kids any favors.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.378
So we should stay together
for each other and ourselves,

13:16.463 --> 13:18.255
or...

13:18.339 --> 13:20.174
Or...

13:21.468 --> 13:24.595
Man, woman, and now Trunkman?

13:24.679 --> 13:26.513
We know science has created
men that have a trunk

13:26.598 --> 13:28.140
that allows them
to have sex with both

13:28.224 --> 13:30.225
male and female partners.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.519
But we don't like the idea of
these people getting married.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.314
Put a line in the sand,
everybody.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.107
Vote "no" on proposition XW2.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.526
The act that says trunkpeople
can get married.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.903
Who needs it?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.404
Not on my watch.

13:42.489 --> 13:46.283
Paid for by Michael Denny
and The Denny Singers.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.410
Hi. I'm a trunkperson,
and I want...

13:48.495 --> 13:51.163
I feel love in my heart, too,
just like you.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.998
I wanna be able
to express that love

13:53.082 --> 13:54.791
with both a man and a woman.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.293
And I won't be able to

13:56.377 --> 13:58.629
if Denny and The Denny Singers
get their way.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.131
Hey, let the trunkpeople have
sex and get married, huh?

14:01.216 --> 14:03.842
Paid for by trunkpeople.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.011
Oh, I love me
strawberry sniggles.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.138
Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets
my hands on me

14:08.223 --> 14:11.433
and tries to steal
my strawberry smiggles.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.918
I'm gonna eat every last
one of them,

14:12.977 --> 14:14.895
because... and then
they'll be in my stomach,

14:14.979 --> 14:16.980
and nobody will ever be
able to eat them.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.441
Except for me, because they'll
be all inside my stomach.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.820
Um, my name is
Mr. Tophat Jones,

14:23.905 --> 14:25.656
and God forbid anyone ever
take my sner...

14:25.740 --> 14:27.449
little-people snibbles.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.951
I'm keeping them all for me.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.994
Mmm. Mmm.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.038
Last bite.
Mmm.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.040
Oh, now they're all resting
comfortably in my stomach.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.583
Ooh, am I feeling good.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.877
No! Get away from me!
Get away from me!

14:38.962 --> 14:40.879
There's no more strawberry
snibbles... no!

14:40.964 --> 14:42.548
[ chokes, sputters]

14:42.632 --> 14:44.466
Jesus Christ!

14:44.551 --> 14:46.134
Jesus Christ! It hurts!

14:46.219 --> 14:47.636
My entrails are out!

14:47.720 --> 14:49.179
Why would you even want
to eat these?

14:49.264 --> 14:51.348
They're soaked
with my stomach acid.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.600
Oh, Jesus Christ, lord, savior,

14:53.685 --> 14:55.477
and spirit, save me.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.187
Take me to the light.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.939
Oh, my god. I see demons.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.482
I see demons are coming!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.192
Geez, Rick.
Oh, my god.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.637
That's some pretty
hard-core stuff,

15:03.653 --> 15:05.571
you know, for a cereal
commercial.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.156
Well, Morty... I mean, you
wanna sell boxes of cereal,

15:08.241 --> 15:09.950
you gotta pump the gas a little.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.660
Pedal to the metal, Morty.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.080
In a world where muscular
Mannies are coming,

15:15.164 --> 15:16.748
and they're coming strong,

15:16.833 --> 15:20.377
there's only three
unmuscular Michaels.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.629
Get down. Hurry. Run.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.172
[ screeching]

15:24.257 --> 15:28.385
And that's when real
Turbulent Juice is coming,

15:28.469 --> 15:31.096
and you got to take care of it.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.515
With Turbulent Juice,
turbulent tables,

15:33.600 --> 15:37.269
no room is safe
from the turbulent power

15:37.353 --> 15:39.396
of Turbulent Juice.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.398
- What in the hell?
- Sex sells, Morty.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.400
Sex sells what?

15:43.484 --> 15:45.986
Was that a movie or, like,
does it clean stuff?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.487
- [ sighs ]
- Hey, Dad.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.989
- God.
- What's going on?

15:49.073 --> 15:50.833
Well, your mother and I
are gonna be spending

15:50.867 --> 15:52.409
some time apart, Morty.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.411
And your sister found out
she was an unwanted pregnancy.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.247
- What?
- Speaking of [burps] what,

15:57.332 --> 16:00.626
Morty, [burps]
what should we watch next?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.461
What about this?

16:02.545 --> 16:04.421
Babylegs, you're a good
detective.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.965
But not good enough,
because of your baby legs.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.967
So I'm partnering you up
with Regularlegs.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.427
Hey, there.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.429
Detective, I'm...
this is upsetting to me

16:12.513 --> 16:15.265
because I feel like I don't
need no regular-leg partner.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.059
Babylegs, don't talk back to me.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.560
Good luck, you two.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.604
There's a criminal to kill.
[ slurps]

16:20.688 --> 16:22.648
Wow, you sure found
this guy quick.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.650
Uh, yeah, because I'm a good
detective.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.443
Look, Babylegs.
It's the criminal.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.195
Oh, fuck it. I'm the killer.
I'm running.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.279
I'm running real quick.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.281
Babylegs, here we go!

16:31.366 --> 16:33.158
[trilling ]

16:33.242 --> 16:35.827
That's the sound I make
when I'm trying to run fast.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.621
[trilling ]

16:37.705 --> 16:39.456
All right, I'm not
gonna get him.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.458
I just learned a real
valuable lesson.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.168
I'm coming, Babylegs.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.045
I'm... Regularlegs.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.672
[ grunts ] We got him.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.340
Hey, that was good teamwork.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.217
Babylegs and Regularlegs,

16:50.301 --> 16:52.219
I'm proud of you two
for working together.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.221
And, Babylegs, I know
it was hard for you

16:54.305 --> 16:56.682
to come to the conclusion
that you need a partner,

16:56.766 --> 16:58.266
