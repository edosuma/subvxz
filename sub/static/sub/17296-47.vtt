00:24.825 --> 00:26.260
That's Beastie's scream.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.428
And it's coming
from the bathroom.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.401
What is it?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.369
Shh. There'll be
a man up in here.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.106
Looks at 'im. Looking
at me all like a creep.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.273
You be creepy, yo.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.608
That's your reflection.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.111
I ain't gots time
to think about my life.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.712
That fool won't stop
looking at me.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.080
No, Beast Boy.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.648
You are looking in the mirror.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.387
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.855
You guys must think
I am a weirdo.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.157
Uh, maybe a little.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.692
Super weird.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.129
Also, the weird "A's," weird "E's," weird
"I's," weird "U's," and weird sometimes "Y's."

01:02.730 --> 01:05.099
Crime alert! We can talk about
how weird Beast Boy is later.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.300
Titans, go!

01:09.603 --> 01:10.738
Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:10.771 --> 01:15.576
Soon, I will have all of
Jump City's precious pizza.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.610
Robin!

01:19.313 --> 01:21.782
How's you get over there
when you was over here?

01:21.815 --> 01:23.651
The shame be upon you, Robin.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.654
Surely, you do not need
all the pizzas for yourself?

01:26.687 --> 01:27.388
That's not me.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.323
Obviously, that's an impostor.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.758
How can you be so sure?

01:32.693 --> 01:33.727
Nice try.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.762
Titans, go!

01:34.795 --> 01:36.464
I say, Titans, go!

01:36.497 --> 01:38.332
No, I say, Titans, go!

01:38.366 --> 01:40.468
How's we gonna figure out
which is which?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.870
We can ask them something
only the real Robin would know.

01:42.903 --> 01:46.340
Oh, the real Robin would know
my favorite of the colors.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.742
Yes. I know this. I uh...

01:48.776 --> 01:52.346
I-it's, uh...
Purple?

01:52.380 --> 01:55.383
The real Robin would know
I do not have the favorite

01:55.416 --> 01:57.785
because all the colors
are full of the beauty!

01:57.818 --> 01:59.353
The impostor!

02:00.254 --> 02:03.191
Stop! Stop!

02:03.224 --> 02:04.492
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.194
Only the real Robin
would cry like that.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.497
I'd recognize
those sobs anywhere.

02:11.432 --> 02:14.768
Stop! Stop!

02:14.802 --> 02:16.737
Reveal yourself.

02:18.872 --> 02:23.411
It seems I am too clever
for the Teen Titans, no?

02:23.444 --> 02:26.680
A shape-shifting Madame Rouge.
I should've known.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.449
Release the pizzas.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.519
Never! Pizza is an abomination.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.655
I will destroy the Earth's
pizza supply,

02:34.688 --> 02:38.259
and replace it with
pierogi and borscht.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.793
Ew!

02:39.827 --> 02:41.295
We won't let that happen.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.496
Titans, go!

02:58.646 --> 03:02.283
You cannot stop me, Titans.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.826
We have to find Madame Rouge
before she strikes again.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.296
I'll get it.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.499
What is it this time?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.334
Probably another mirror.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.969
Who is you?

03:22.002 --> 03:23.271
I is me.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.572
How come you looks like me?

03:24.605 --> 03:26.807
How come you looks like me?

03:26.840 --> 03:27.975
I asked you first.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.577
I asked you second.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.579
And two is more than one.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.846
I think.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.482
What is the happening?

03:34.515 --> 03:37.251
I don't know, but that's
a lot of bad grammar.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.720
Wait a second.
Is I you?

03:39.753 --> 03:40.888
Is you me?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.391
I so confused!

03:43.424 --> 03:45.826
Okay. Don't hurt yourselves,
brainiacs.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.328
This is Beast Boy.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.330
Who is you... Uh, who are you?

03:49.363 --> 03:51.565
I'm Beast Girl!

03:51.599 --> 03:53.334
Did you tracks me down

03:53.367 --> 03:55.369
'cause we're some of them
good old, long-lost relatives?

03:55.403 --> 03:56.737
No, pooh.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.839
I was just out minding
my own, doing my business

03:58.872 --> 04:01.008
in the bathroom and then...

04:01.041 --> 04:04.912
I sees this creepy green lady
looking at me. I freaked out!

04:04.945 --> 04:06.614
And ran, and ended up here.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.516
Looks like you got
a double, Beastie.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.884
Wow. A girl version of me.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.520
This is blowing my minds!

04:12.553 --> 04:14.388
Is this blowing your minds?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.490
'Cause it's blowing my mind!

04:16.924 --> 04:17.925
Oh, my God.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.560
My head is so blown.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.563
Wait. Hold up. What if...

04:22.596 --> 04:25.032
Aah! It's Madame Rouge!

04:25.065 --> 04:26.667
Who? Where?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.503
You, girl. You's Madame Rouge. I knows it.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.539
I don't think that's her.

04:31.572 --> 04:35.743
You are being the weird A, E, I, O, U,
and sometimes Y again, Beast Boy.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.345
Oh, my bad.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.912
Phew! I's was scared.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.449
The real Madame Rouge
is still on the loose.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.484
Titans, back to your stations.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.720
You all's mind if I go hang out with
Beast Girl for a minute instead?

04:46.754 --> 04:48.789
Sure, you don't really
contribute much.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.923
Cool. Thanks, Robin.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.427
So, girl...

04:53.461 --> 04:54.728
Tell me about your story.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.631
Sweet! Let's takes
a little stroll.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.532
Where to?

04:58.566 --> 05:00.368
Down them memory lane, son.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.869
Way back in the day,

05:01.902 --> 05:03.704
I was born in a jungle.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.973
Me too, yo.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.576
And my parents was scientists.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.910
Mine's too.

05:09.943 --> 05:13.013
Then I got bit
by this crazy green monkey.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.483
No way! I gots
bit by a green monkey, too.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.550
Nuh-uh, bro.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.851
Ya-huh, yo.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.053
Then I gots real sick

05:20.087 --> 05:23.056
and my moms and pops gave me this
green serum to save my life.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.025
I gots better, but I turned...

05:25.058 --> 05:26.560
Green.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.561
And I could turn into...

05:27.595 --> 05:28.762
Animals!

05:30.030 --> 05:33.701
Wow girl! We's got so much
in common, yo.

05:33.734 --> 05:37.070
Then I bet you know what
I wants to do right now.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.539
You knows, I do.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.737
You know, Beast Boy, you's
the first person in a long time

06:09.770 --> 06:11.805
that don't make me
feel like a weirdo.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.408
Me too, yo.
That's what's up.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.709
That's what's up.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.513
What up, Titans?

06:19.547 --> 06:20.714
Greetings, dear friends.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.015
What up, mind blowers?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.150
Yeah, yeah, how you doing?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.618
Oh, you again.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.787
They kind of reminds me
of my friends, yo.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.489
You's got friends, too?

06:28.522 --> 06:29.723
We's so much alike.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.492
I got friends
and you got friends.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.461
We get it. You're alike!

06:33.494 --> 06:35.763
Now, if you don't mind, we're
trying to find Madame Rouge.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.131
Who's this Madame Rouge
ya'll keep talking about?

06:38.165 --> 06:40.901
She's a super villain who can
disguise herself as anyone.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.202
Wait. Anyone?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.171
Anyone at any time.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.606
That means...

06:46.139 --> 06:47.475
She could be me!

06:47.508 --> 06:49.510
I mean, I could be her!

06:49.543 --> 06:51.178
No way, girl.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.747
We's too much alike for you to
be anybody besides yourself.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.650
But check it. Madame Rouge
is a girl, right?

06:56.684 --> 06:58.486
I is a girl, too!

06:58.519 --> 07:02.122
Plus, my astronautical chart
has all these pictures that says

07:02.155 --> 07:03.824
I's gonna make a change.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.728
Horoscopes always say
vague stuff like that.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.097
Also, I love me some pierogis.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.668
Enjoying dumplings doesn't
really mean anything.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.838
But I gots here at the same time
that she disappeared.

07:17.871 --> 07:21.842
That's can only mean...
I is her!

07:22.943 --> 07:26.647
Wow, okay. You two
have a lot in common.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.516
You fools don't believe me?

07:28.549 --> 07:29.817
I is Madame Rouge.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.218
And I'll proves it.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.226
Whoa, what you doing, fool?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.861
Capturizing you, fool.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.497
'Cause I is the evil
Madame Rouge.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.232
Bu-but I thought we was friends.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.134
Me too.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.036
But I guess that was all part of
my evilness to try and trick you.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.105
Bu-but, you was like
my sister to me.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.075
Beast Boy, you
got to get through to her.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.245
Listen, yo.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.047
I don't know where all this evilness
is coming from, but it ain't you.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.415
How do you know?

08:02.449 --> 08:05.118
'Cause, you's the only person who
makes me feel normal, Beast Girl.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.154
There ain't nothing
evil about that.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.822
You's right, Beast Bro.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.125
Sorry, guys.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.762
I guess I'm not Madame Rouge.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.930
You most certainly are not.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.302
You were here the whole time?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.538
Hiding right under
your backsides.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.839
Ew!

08:38.151 --> 08:41.321
By this time tomorrow, all of
world's pizza will be replaced

08:41.354 --> 08:43.023
by my pierogi and borscht.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.558
You won't get away with this.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.759
But of course I will.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.628
There is no one left to stop me.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.236
Let them go,
you evil British lady!

08:56.269 --> 09:01.208
Not a chance.
These Titans could not stop me.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.910
And neither will you.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.845
We'll sees about that, boo!

09:04.878 --> 09:06.947
Opposite gender Titans, go!

09:15.823 --> 09:16.957
Such strength!

09:19.326 --> 09:20.661
Such agility.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.964
Such... normal sized hands.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.600
My guy is cool.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.205
The boy me is quite formidable.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.809
Hence the handsome.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.277
Yeah, that's my girl
right there.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.317
That's what's up!

09:44.351 --> 09:48.121
Opposite Gender Titans,
you were the amazing.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.657
Especially, the you.

09:50.824 --> 09:51.959
Great, thanks for all the help.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.226
Hope to repay the favor
some day.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.665
I's really glad we met, yo.

09:57.698 --> 10:01.334
Me toos. Now, I know I ain't
such a weirdo after all.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.836
That's what's up.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.838
That's what's up.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.240
Wait. I just
realized something.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.242
If I ain't Madame Rouge,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.178
maybe you is.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.279
Oh! Is I?

10:12.312 --> 10:13.681
Is you?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.983
Maybe I is.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.819
Now, I gots to defeat you
in my evilness, yo.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.755
Yo, you was like
a brother to me.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.292
Weirdos.
