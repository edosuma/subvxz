Hey, Peter.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.414
<i>Hey, Lee, how are you?</i>

02:43.873 --> 02:44.707
What's up?

02:44.999 --> 02:46.834
<i>Have you ever heard of a group called</i>

02:47.042 --> 02:49.962
<i>The Western Appreciation
and Preservation Guild?</i>

02:51.130 --> 02:52.214
No.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.300
<i>Well, I just got a call from them,</i>

02:54.967 --> 02:57.636
<i>they want to give you
a Lifetime Achievement Award.</i>

02:58.804 --> 02:59.638
Okay.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.059
Lifetime, huh?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.186
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:07.646 --> 03:08.814
Is there anything else?

03:09.648 --> 03:12.154
<i>I don't know, there's some
sort of award ceremony.</i>

03:12.234 --> 03:16.158
I figured that. I mean,
is there anything else? Like...

03:16.238 --> 03:18.699
Uh, I don't know. A job offer? A script?

03:20.284 --> 03:21.452
<i>Not at the moment.</i>

03:23.078 --> 03:25.164
<i>But we're expecting
some things soon, Lee.</i>

03:27.625 --> 03:28.667
Right.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.430
Lee. Sorry to keep you waiting.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.473
It's fine.

04:31.105 --> 04:34.858
I know we were all hoping to get
good news about this biopsy.

04:35.693 --> 04:38.862
But... I'm afraid I don't have good news.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.518
Shit.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.438
Goddammit.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.118
Lee.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.496
Shit. You trying to
give me a heart attack?

08:15.704 --> 08:17.748
I'm trying to get you to open
the god damn door.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.041
That was a cop-knock.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.878
You know, like you're a cop knocking.
That's how cops knock.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.548
You wanna smoke some joints?

08:26.715 --> 08:27.758
Yeah.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.520
Are you okay?

08:42.731 --> 08:44.024
You seem a little...

08:44.525 --> 08:45.442
off.

08:47.736 --> 08:48.946
The thing is...

08:52.241 --> 08:53.367
I got some news.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.703
What news?

08:56.954 --> 08:59.331
<i>♪ Baby, baby, why, oh, why ♪</i>

09:00.082 --> 09:02.376
<i>♪ Why did you leave me ♪</i>

09:02.834 --> 09:05.212
<i>♪ For another guy... ♪</i>

09:06.713 --> 09:07.756
I wanna make a movie.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.676
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.557
I had this dream last night...

09:13.637 --> 09:15.097
Mm... stop right there.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.810
Why?

09:16.890 --> 09:17.975
Question?

09:19.309 --> 09:21.186
Do you like hearing
about other people's dreams?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.193
I don't know.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.190
Sure.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.401
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.738
Because for me hearing about
other people's dreams is...

09:33.699 --> 09:35.367
You telling me you don't
wanna hear about my dream?

09:37.286 --> 09:38.166
Yeah.

09:38.246 --> 09:39.329
Fuck you.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.665
It just doesn't interest me, man.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.793
Think about it, I mean, it's your dream.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.378
What about movies?

09:47.170 --> 09:48.130
Do they interest you?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.591
Yeah. I love movies.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.801
Movies are other people's dreams.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.055
So...

09:57.639 --> 09:59.349
You got an ounce of this shit, or what?

10:00.058 --> 10:00.892
I need it.

10:01.727 --> 10:02.728
An ounce?

10:02.894 --> 10:03.729
Yeah.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.523
One ounce of the devil's lettuce.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.401
That's gonna clean me out, man.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.573
I don't why you just can't go to
the store like everybody else.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.617
I like coming here.

10:17.951 --> 10:18.994
Yeah?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.789
You are a creature of habit,
if ever there was one.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.917
It's called Platinum Cookies.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.253
It's a blend, it's real good shit.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.006
Platinum Cookies.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.178
Platinum Cookies, the real good shit.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.117

You're staring at me.

12:53.064 --> 12:53.940
Sorry.

12:55.484 --> 12:59.279
I didn't say I had a problem with it,
I was just simply pointing it out.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.073
I like trying to figure people out.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.621
I think you can figure out a lot
about a person by just looking at them.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.249
Okay.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.712
So, what'd you figure out about me?

13:17.047 --> 13:17.881
Not a thing.

13:25.889 --> 13:26.932
How do I know you?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.769
I know you from something.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.396
If you say so.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.982
Are you an actor?

13:37.901 --> 13:38.985
Yeah.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.198
All the actors I know are
self-centered and insane.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.327
Sounds about right.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.627
You're staring at me now?

13:56.878 --> 13:57.921
Yeah.

13:59.089 --> 14:02.425
Seeing if I can... figure you out.

14:03.927 --> 14:04.761
Can you?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.098
You seem sad.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.352
There you go.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.312
Thanks.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.274
It's all here, but... count it.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.068
Don't drink too much with these.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.070
Thanks.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.951
Jesus! Get some sun, man.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.412
Nice to meet you, um...

14:32.497 --> 14:33.915
Sorry, I forgot your name.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.710
- Lee.
- Right. Lee.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.297
They say that memory
is the second thing to go.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.717
And what's the first?

14:44.134 --> 14:45.218
I can't remember.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.389
How do you two know each other?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.767
We were on a TV show together.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.561
Nothing you've ever heard of.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.814
<i>It's called Cattle Drive.
It ran for 13 episodes.</i>

14:58.565 --> 14:59.524
Lee was the lead.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.613
Ben Horn, a gun slinger.

15:01.693 --> 15:02.527
Whoa.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.655
I was a cocky kid who stole
the wrong man's horse.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.116
- You mean you had a real job once?
- Yeah.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.744
Had a wife too. So did he.

15:11.703 --> 15:12.954
Now, we just have each other.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.415
Well.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.127
Nice to meet you, Lee.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.250
This one, and this one.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.718
What a nice surprise.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.137
A nice surprise?

16:17.811 --> 16:18.728
Good to see you, Val.

16:19.104 --> 16:19.938
Sure it is.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.243
You getting ready for another show?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.578
Yes, at the end of the month.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.386
Have you seen Lucy recently?

16:52.721 --> 16:56.016
Yes, she came over for dinner,
we watched some TV on Sunday.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.313
What'd you watch?

17:04.107 --> 17:06.108
You wanna know what
we watched on television?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.569
I haven't seen Lucy in a long time.

17:08.862 --> 17:09.695
Call her.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.740
She doesn't want me to call her.

17:12.115 --> 17:12.949
Don't do that.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.452
I don't blame her.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.960
You should call her.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.400
I've got something I wanna tell you.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.577
I'm gonna make a movie.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.086
<i>Peter Cohen's office.</i>

18:06.461 --> 18:08.383
Hey, Chelsea, it's Lee, for Peter.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.299
<i>- Hi, Lee, let me see if I have him.
- Thanks.</i>

18:14.928 --> 18:16.179
<i>Lee, what's up?</i>

18:16.513 --> 18:18.681
When did you say that thing was again?

18:19.182 --> 18:21.351
<i>- The Western award?
- Yeah.</i>

18:47.710 --> 18:48.753
Dad.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.630
You look good out there.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.260
Remember when we used to play?

18:58.346 --> 18:59.389
What are you doing here?

19:02.392 --> 19:03.810
I mean, how did you know I was here?

19:04.769 --> 19:05.687
Your mother told me.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.065
I was in the neighborhood, and I just...

19:12.902 --> 19:13.862
How's work going?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.739
Still waiting tables at that steakhouse?

19:17.740 --> 19:18.700
I liked that place.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.954
I work for Google.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.373
Oh.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.792
Yeah, I sell advertising space for them.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.003
Wow.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.214
Yeah.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.592
What's up?

19:37.594 --> 19:38.761
Oh.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.518
I guess it's been a while, huh?

19:41.598 --> 19:42.724
Yeah.

19:44.934 --> 19:45.935
You look the same though.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.396
That's good, I guess.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.778
I was thinking, uh...

19:59.449 --> 20:02.702
I'm getting this lifetime
achievement award thing, and uh...

20:03.620 --> 20:05.455
it's no big deal but,

20:08.374 --> 20:12.086
I was thinking maybe you'd like
to go with me to the ceremony.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.008
When is it?

20:17.675 --> 20:18.593
Sunday.

20:19.844 --> 20:20.678
This Sunday?

20:21.930 --> 20:24.140
I'm going to Palm Springs
with Jake. I can't cancel.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.434
Right.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.020
Okay.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.315
How about dinner when you get back?

20:34.192 --> 20:37.737
My treat. You pick the place,
time, whatever.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.203
I'm free Tuesday.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.998
Yeah. Yeah, that'll be great.

20:52.794 --> 20:53.711
I got to get back.

<i>- Can I call you back?
- Yeah, that's fine.</i>

24:29.677 --> 24:31.262
Best tacos in L.A., right?

24:31.888 --> 24:32.972
Yeah.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.099
You live around here?

24:35.516 --> 24:36.476
No.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.645
Stalking you.

24:40.313 --> 24:41.397
Yeah.

24:44.358 --> 24:45.276
Charlotte, right?

24:46.903 --> 24:48.446
Got a good memory for an old pot-head.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.823
A sad old pot-head.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.576
Why did you say that anyway?

24:54.911 --> 24:58.247
Um, because you're old
and you smoke a lot of weed.

24:59.207 --> 25:00.833
I mean, the part about me being sad.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.129
I don't know.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.340
Are you?

25:10.927 --> 25:12.178
Nothing wrong with that.

25:20.978 --> 25:21.896
Are you married?

25:23.606 --> 25:26.234
Divorced. Have been for a long time.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.532
So are you gonna ask for my number?

25:35.535 --> 25:36.577
You want me to?

25:39.747 --> 25:40.790
Yeah.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.585
What? You got a thing for
sad old guys or something?

25:45.294 --> 25:47.046
No.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.339
Just old guys.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.226
You doing anything on Sunday night?

26:21.414 --> 26:22.582
Cheers.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.126
To achieving things in a lifetime.

26:25.543 --> 26:26.711
Sure.

26:28.754 --> 26:32.842
<i>♪ You keep on moving in and out, girl ♪</i>

26:33.134 --> 26:35.261
<i>♪ You keep on moving ♪</i>

26:39.432 --> 26:40.808
What's that?

26:42.435 --> 26:43.811
Fairy powder.

26:44.312 --> 26:45.563
Uh-huh.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.483
It's something that
will make you feel great.

26:51.402 --> 26:52.945
I'm feeling pretty good right now.

26:54.697 --> 26:55.906
Oh, yeah?

26:58.034 --> 27:01.037
<i>♪ You keep on moving... ♪</i>

27:05.041 --> 27:08.794
It won't kill you, I promise.
But no peer pressure.

27:11.797 --> 27:12.882
Give me that stuff.

27:20.348 --> 27:23.309
You really like burning the candle
at both ends, don't you?

27:24.185 --> 27:25.728
It seems like you do too.

27:34.695 --> 27:35.696
You know who came up with that?

27:37.323 --> 27:38.574
"Burning the candle at both ends"?

27:39.950 --> 27:40.785
Who's that?

27:42.078 --> 27:43.663
Edna St. Vincent Millay.

27:49.710 --> 27:53.756
"My candle burns at both ends,
it will not last the night,

27:55.007 --> 27:57.510
"But, ah, my foes, and oh, my friends,

27:57.718 --> 27:59.679
It gives a lovely light!"

28:02.223 --> 28:03.307
Isn't it great?

28:04.558 --> 28:05.851
<i>It's called First Fig.</i>

28:14.276 --> 28:15.319
What?

28:18.072 --> 28:19.281
I'm thinking.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.992
What are you thinking?

28:23.494 --> 28:26.372
That if you were maybe
20 years older, I'd probably kiss you.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.125
I got to wait 20 years?

28:29.834 --> 28:31.085
You'll be dead in 20 years.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.547
Don't remind me.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.345
So, you're ready for tonight?

28:44.473 --> 28:45.558
Not really.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.186
Are you gonna give a speech?

28:52.148 --> 28:53.524
They'll be expecting that.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.277
Just talk about all your
lifetime achievements.

28:59.113 --> 29:00.906
I did one film that I'm proud of.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.534
That was 40 years ago.

29:04.452 --> 29:07.121
Since then, I've stayed busy,
but I wouldn't say I've been...

29:09.373 --> 29:10.291
achieving.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.839
It's kinda weird being remembered
for one part for so many years.

29:17.882 --> 29:18.924
Yeah?

29:21.385 --> 29:24.180
But it's about as close to immortality
as any person can get.

29:25.639 --> 29:26.807
You haven't even seen it.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.726
I don't need to see it.

29:30.186 --> 29:31.479
I've got you right here.

29:33.355 --> 29:34.607
Got the man himself.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.277
The Hero.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.532
Okay.

29:54.835 --> 29:58.172
<i>♪ If you love somebody enough ♪</i>

29:59.507 --> 30:02.551
<i>♪ You'll follow wherever they go ♪</i>

30:03.135 --> 30:05.429
So, when is this
fairy powder going to kick in?

30:06.013 --> 30:06.931
Pretty soon.

30:07.389 --> 30:10.392
And then this is going to seem like
the greatest party of all time.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.061
It better.

30:12.603 --> 30:13.729
Mr. Hayden.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.106
- Please, call me Lee.
- Gary.

30:16.524 --> 30:19.318
Gary Babcock, I'm the...
the president of the...

30:19.860 --> 30:21.862
the Western Appreciation
and Preservation Guild.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.656
We're... we're so honored
to have you here.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.157
I'm honored to be here, Gary.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.409
- This is...
- Hi, I'm Cathy Lee.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.494
Cathy Lee.

30:31.956 --> 30:33.374
- Funny.
- Isn't it?

30:33.541 --> 30:36.836
When I met him I thought,
this must be meant to be.

30:38.128 --> 30:38.963
Uh-huh.

30:39.839 --> 30:43.425
This is such a cool event,
such a... diverse crowd.

30:43.968 --> 30:46.804
Uh, yeah. Sure.

30:48.138 --> 30:52.104
Well, would you mind stepping over?
We'd like to get a few pictures.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.060
Sure.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.812
- You too, Cathy Lee.
- You bet.

30:58.983 --> 31:00.442
- Oh.
- Woah. Pardon me, darlin'.

31:00.693 --> 31:01.735
No, I'm...

31:03.112 --> 31:06.782
I mean, you can bump
into me anytime you want, Mr. Hayden.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.952
Well, there you go.

31:11.829 --> 31:12.872
I'm Betsy.

31:13.122 --> 31:14.164
How do you do, Betsy?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.876
I'm such a huge fan.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.419
Well, thank you.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.255
Would you mind signing something for me?

31:21.505 --> 31:23.883
- I'll be happy to.
- Really appreciate it.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.135
Here.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.597
To Betsy.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.602
My bumpin' buddy.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.022
I love that.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.734
Thank you.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.739
- Here you go, Betsy.
- Thank you so much.

31:43.819 --> 31:47.323
- You're so welcome.
- And I just love your mustache.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.241
Well...

31:50.534 --> 31:51.911
It loves you too.

31:52.828 --> 31:53.871
Mr. Hayden.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.373
Would you mind stepping over here?

31:59.209 --> 32:01.128
Yep, I feel it too.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.213
You all know this year's recipient.

33:26.839 --> 33:31.802
His... his unmistakable voice,
his iconic mustache,

33:32.219 --> 33:35.639
made him one of most popular
actors in the 1970s and 80s.

33:36.140 --> 33:40.144
His turn as "The Hero"
in the film by the same name is... is

33:41.103 --> 33:42.604
widely considered one of the...

33:43.313 --> 33:45.858
one of the greatest western
performances of all time.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.193
Let's take a look.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.487
The one, the only, Lee Hayden.

34:04.877 --> 34:08.464
Hold it right there, friend.
We been lookin' for you.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.257
Is that right?

34:52.299 --> 34:58.680
Ladies and gentlemen, the Western Icon
Lifetime Achievement Award recipient

34:59.515 --> 35:01.934
for this year, Mr. Lee Hayden.

35:29.044 --> 35:29.878
Thank you.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.215
Wow.

35:35.175 --> 35:36.468
I don't know what to say.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.432
Awards are a strange thing.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.936
I mean, what does it say about you?

35:48.605 --> 35:52.484
Before I came here tonight, I looked up
"achievement" in the dictionary.

35:53.735 --> 35:55.070
It's not a difficult word.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.156
We all know what it means.

35:59.283 --> 36:00.534
But I looked it up anyway.

36:01.618 --> 36:02.995
Looked it up on my phone.

36:05.539 --> 36:10.961
And it said, "the result of hard work."

36:14.006 --> 36:17.259
Well, I certainly have worked hard.

36:21.221 --> 36:22.389
But the thing is...

36:24.933 --> 36:27.102
I know there are a lot
of others out there who

36:29.104 --> 36:31.607
are more deserving
than I am of this award.

36:32.482 --> 36:35.319
And so, I'm not sure why I'm
standing up here right now.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.156
Not sure I deserve this.

36:41.450 --> 36:42.534
Any of this.

36:45.412 --> 36:46.330
We love you, Lee.

36:48.332 --> 36:49.499
I love you too.

36:52.586 --> 36:55.631
I do. I feel that love.

36:58.675 --> 36:59.635
Deeply.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.389
I'm nothing without all of you.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.643
Just a grain of sand.

37:10.354 --> 37:15.150
And that's the thing,
we're all just grains of sand.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.112
We're just people.

37:19.947 --> 37:22.449
People working hard and
trying to do our best.

37:23.951 --> 37:24.785
Aren't we?

37:25.202 --> 37:26.828
- Yeah.
- Yes.

37:27.454 --> 37:31.083
I'm no better than you
and you're no better than me.

37:32.793 --> 37:36.797
Everyone in this room
is as deserving as I am of this award.

37:43.345 --> 37:44.429
Like you, Miss.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.600
Yes, ma'am, you.

37:49.184 --> 37:53.188
Come here. It's okay, come on up.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.440
Come on up.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.206
What's your name, darlin'?

38:11.748 --> 38:12.791
Diane.

38:13.542 --> 38:14.584
Diane.

38:16.253 --> 38:20.257
Wow, this jacket you've got on sure is...

38:21.925 --> 38:23.093
soft.

38:25.429 --> 38:26.847
Tell you what, Diane,

38:28.515 --> 38:29.683
you are my...

38:30.767 --> 38:33.770

38:34.813 --> 38:37.399
Here you go. Diane, everybody.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.197
Diane is my hero.

38:45.824 --> 38:46.992
Let's hear it for Diane.

38:48.285 --> 38:50.454
She is a fucking icon.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.461
Diane! Diane!

38:58.754 --> 39:01.465
Diane! Diane! Diane! Diane!

39:45.759 --> 39:47.469
Hold it right there, friend.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.603
We've been looking for you.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.733
- That right?
- Not just us.

40:02.984 --> 40:05.278
Got to be at least
eight bounties on your head.

40:06.405 --> 40:08.365
We intend to collect on all of 'em.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.076
What?

40:11.410 --> 40:13.995
Do you think you can keep
running like this forever?

40:16.873 --> 40:19.751
You can't outrun destiny, amigo.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.506
And they call you "The Hero."

40:26.174 --> 40:28.009
But we know who you really are.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.071
<i>And that's a cut.</i>

40:48.822 --> 40:49.906
<i>Everybody take five.</i>

40:50.407 --> 40:51.495
Thanks, Lee.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.437
Hey, Dad.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.355
How was the procedure?

41:22.939 --> 41:24.274
You know what I always said?

41:24.858 --> 41:26.276
I'm not going anywhere.

42:16.493 --> 42:17.577
Hi.

42:20.163 --> 42:22.499
Morning. Coffee?

42:23.333 --> 42:24.167
Yes.

42:35.095 --> 42:36.096
Thanks.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.267
Did we, uh...

42:43.186 --> 42:44.271
No.

42:45.272 --> 42:46.898
Molly usually isn't good
for that sort of thing.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.360
We did other stuff though.

42:51.570 --> 42:52.654
Other stuff?

42:53.321 --> 42:55.657
Yeah, we went out. After the ceremony.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.118
We went out?

42:58.660 --> 42:59.536
Yeah.

43:00.328 --> 43:02.289
To a few bars, and a club.

43:03.123 --> 43:06.751
You, um... danced. A lot.

43:17.387 --> 43:18.388
How old are you?

43:21.433 --> 43:22.392
How old are you?

43:22.642 --> 43:23.476
Seventy...

43:24.352 --> 43:25.312
One.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.397
Why do you wanna know how old I am?

43:28.440 --> 43:29.899
Because this seems a little odd.

43:30.150 --> 43:31.818
- Does it?
- Yeah.

43:32.569 --> 43:35.238
I mean you look like you could be my
daughter's age for Christ's sake.

43:35.405 --> 43:37.782
Jesus. Don't make it weird.

43:38.199 --> 43:39.284
It is a little weird.

43:42.037 --> 43:43.204
How old's your daughter?

43:45.624 --> 43:46.541
Thirty four.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.460
Cool, well... I'm older than her.

43:49.127 --> 43:50.128
Still.

43:52.756 --> 43:56.092
Look, I'm just a little...
confused right now.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.721
I don't understand why you're here.

44:01.473 --> 44:02.724
You asked me out, right?

44:03.600 --> 44:04.688
Yeah.

44:04.768 --> 44:05.602
So, what the fuck, man.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.771
I'm not busting your balls
because you're older than my dad.

44:08.938 --> 44:09.773
But whatever.

44:11.441 --> 44:12.859
If you've got a problem with it, I'll go.

44:13.276 --> 44:14.653
No, I don't want you to go.

44:14.903 --> 44:17.113
Okay so, what do you want?

44:20.742 --> 44:21.785
I don't know.

44:23.662 --> 44:25.163
Don't think so hard about it, man.

44:26.122 --> 44:27.666
You're thinking
about it instead of just...

44:32.629 --> 44:34.089
Can I have some milk in my coffee?

44:35.298 --> 44:36.508
I'm sorry.

44:46.726 --> 44:48.561
I'm here because I wanna be here.

44:50.522 --> 44:52.440
Trust me,
I got plenty of places I could be.

44:53.566 --> 44:55.527
But I'm here with you.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.364
But if you don't want me here, I can go.

45:01.574 --> 45:05.203
After I drink my coffee.
'Cause this coffee's pretty good.

45:06.663 --> 45:07.872
That's Folgers.

45:22.887 --> 45:23.972
I don't want you to go.

47:11.454 --> 47:12.497
Can't find my phone.

47:14.082 --> 47:14.999
You got to call somebody?

47:17.001 --> 47:18.503
I like to check in once in a while.

47:25.385 --> 47:26.723
Lee, oh, my God!

47:26.803 --> 47:27.846
What?

47:28.847 --> 47:29.931
You're trending on Twitter.

47:31.432 --> 47:33.518
Your speech last night...
I got a text from Jeremy.

47:35.061 --> 47:36.688
Oh, my God, it went viral, dude.

47:37.355 --> 47:39.399
TMZ, Entertainment Weekly,

47:39.941 --> 47:42.902
Jezebel... Holy shit!
You went viral, dude.

47:43.319 --> 47:44.449
What're you talking about?

47:44.529 --> 47:47.699
Your speech. When you
brought that lady up on stage...

47:48.700 --> 47:49.826
Okay, yeah.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.452
People are going nuts over it.

47:52.370 --> 47:53.454
Oh, my God!

47:53.955 --> 47:56.291
Diane! They interviewed Diane!

47:58.668 --> 48:00.545
Man, we really got to find your phone.

48:02.422 --> 48:03.840
I'm not sure I want to know.

48:06.759 --> 48:08.094
Let's forget about the phone.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.825
You have a job to go to or what?

48:32.493 --> 48:33.870
What do you do anyway?

48:39.459 --> 48:43.254
So you wanna like...
get to know me or something?

48:45.048 --> 48:46.215
Yeah, I do.

48:50.553 --> 48:51.638
I'm a comedian.

48:54.098 --> 48:57.810
- A comedian?
- Yeah, I do stand-up.

49:01.064 --> 49:02.273
I have a show tonight actually.

49:03.733 --> 49:05.193
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:15.078 --> 49:16.204
Wanna come?

49:17.747 --> 49:18.790
You want me to?

49:22.418 --> 49:23.753
Yeah, sure.

49:25.463 --> 49:28.049
Hotel Cafe, eight o'clock.

49:30.343 --> 49:31.427
I'll let you know.

49:37.433 --> 49:40.019
Are you gonna tell me
how old you are or what?

49:53.032 --> 49:55.243
<i>Diane, my hero.</i>

49:55.910 --> 49:56.995
Let's hear it for Diane.

49:58.454 --> 50:02.208
<i>She's a fucking icon!</i>

50:06.421 --> 50:09.841
You've got almost
two million views in less than 24 hours.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.472
- And that's a good thing?
- Fuck yeah, man.

50:12.552 --> 50:15.179
Everybody's talking about you today.
They love you.

50:15.805 --> 50:17.015
Check this out.

50:18.725 --> 50:19.559
Hey, wait a minute, what...

50:20.560 --> 50:21.644
What is this thing here?

50:22.854 --> 50:24.188
You don't know about the iceberg?

50:24.856 --> 50:25.815
No.

50:26.733 --> 50:29.777
Success is just the tip
of the iceberg, man.

50:30.903 --> 50:32.030
But underneath...

50:32.905 --> 50:35.658
is all your experiences
that made that iceberg.

50:36.617 --> 50:39.412
And you're the only one
who knows what's really down there.

50:43.249 --> 50:44.333
It's a metaphor.

50:45.376 --> 50:47.587
People look at you and
they only see the success.

50:52.133 --> 50:54.555
It's like a figurative
representation, like poetry...

50:54.635 --> 50:55.678
Yeah, I see. I get it.

50:57.138 --> 50:59.557
What I don't get is why this
is on your computer.

51:01.768 --> 51:02.894
'Cause it's true.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.237
<i>- Hey, Peter.
- Lee.</i>

51:13.404 --> 51:14.947
<i>I've been trying to reach you all day.</i>

51:15.615 --> 51:16.657
Yeah, what's up?

51:16.949 --> 51:18.367
<i>What did you get into last night?</i>

51:18.826 --> 51:20.119
I don't know.

51:20.828 --> 51:23.790
<i>Well, the phone has not stopped ringing
for you all day.</i>

51:24.832 --> 51:25.792
For what?

51:26.709 --> 51:27.668
<i>For work.</i>

51:28.628 --> 51:31.631
<i>I got offers, I got scripts,
more commercial work.</i>

51:33.341 --> 51:35.093
<i>I just got a call and
they wanna bring you in</i>

51:35.426 --> 51:38.137
<i>for this massive new
movie called Galactic.</i>

51:38.596 --> 51:39.889
Are you serious?

51:40.389 --> 51:41.394
<i>Yeah.</i>

51:41.474 --> 51:44.143
<i>It's this fantasy thing,
based on a young adult novel</i>

51:44.435 --> 51:46.145
<i>and there's a great role in it for you.</i>

51:46.729 --> 51:49.232
<i>This guy is the ultimate cowboy.</i>

51:49.732 --> 51:50.817
So, there's an offer?

51:52.151 --> 51:53.903
<i>You just need to come in and audition.</i>

51:54.529 --> 51:57.323
I haven't auditioned in
40 fucking years, Peter.

51:57.573 --> 51:58.995
<i>They want you to come in tomorrow.</i>

51:59.075 --> 52:00.118
Tomorrow?

52:01.160 --> 52:02.620
<i>You can't say no to this, Lee.</i>

52:03.079 --> 52:04.413
<i>You just can't.</i>

52:08.126 --> 52:09.502
Look, the thing is, I got some...

52:14.715 --> 52:15.758
All right.

52:16.259 --> 52:17.510
Fax over the pages.

52:20.179 --> 52:21.264
Wow.

52:23.099 --> 52:24.350
You still fax?

52:43.786 --> 52:45.079
You seem a little tense.

52:46.622 --> 52:48.124
I'm just trying to focus here, man.

52:48.457 --> 52:49.500
This helps me focus.

52:51.169 --> 52:53.007
Helps me come off the mountain, man.

52:53.087 --> 52:55.173
What fucking mountain
are you talking about?

53:16.903 --> 53:18.404
Thought you were already making a movie.

53:19.071 --> 53:20.156
It was a pipe dream.

53:22.200 --> 53:23.159
This is real.

53:26.329 --> 53:27.330
Okay.

53:39.884 --> 53:42.637
Jesus Christ. You're making me crazy
with all that moving around.

53:43.596 --> 53:44.597
Sorry.

53:53.773 --> 53:54.857
You wanna run lines?

53:59.695 --> 54:00.696
Who are you?

54:01.739 --> 54:02.823
They call me Turner.

54:04.408 --> 54:05.243
Turner?

54:05.534 --> 54:06.410
That's right.

54:07.245 --> 54:08.329
And I'm here to help you.

54:09.247 --> 54:10.498
But why?

54:11.249 --> 54:13.292
Because you're my daughter.

54:15.670 --> 54:16.963
I've come to save you.

54:18.589 --> 54:21.467
And I need you to come with me. Now.

54:22.051 --> 54:22.885
My father?

54:23.928 --> 54:25.263
You're not my father.

54:25.513 --> 54:26.681
Listen to me.

54:27.515 --> 54:30.062
If we don't go now,
we're as good as dead.

54:30.142 --> 54:32.603
My father is dead.
He died a long time ago.

54:32.937 --> 54:33.941
It's me.

54:34.021 --> 54:35.273
You don't even look like him!

54:35.606 --> 54:37.858
I had to change the way I look
to protect you.

54:39.235 --> 54:40.319
I did die.

54:42.113 --> 54:44.323
In some ways,
I've been dead for a long time.

54:46.200 --> 54:47.368
I had to leave you.

54:48.828 --> 54:50.079
But I did that to save you.

54:51.998 --> 54:53.708
You were better off thinking I was dead.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.796
When I heard the council
was coming after you...

55:00.506 --> 55:01.507
well...

55:03.467 --> 55:05.177
let's just say I'm not dead anymore.

55:07.763 --> 55:08.806
I'm your father.

55:10.308 --> 55:11.559
And I'm here to help you.

55:14.103 --> 55:15.146
I love you.

55:16.856 --> 55:18.149
And you have to come with me.

55:19.859 --> 55:21.944
You have to come
with me now, or we'll both die.

55:27.533 --> 55:29.452
You remember what
I always used to call you?

55:32.163 --> 55:33.622
Buttercup.

55:36.125 --> 55:37.543
It's me, Buttercup.

55:42.173 --> 55:43.758
I've been gone for a long time.

55:46.344 --> 55:47.887
And I may not look the same.

55:49.889 --> 55:50.806
But it's me.

55:53.392 --> 55:54.518
I'm here now.

55:56.771 --> 55:59.732
I'm here now, and that's...
That's all that matters.

56:10.284 --> 56:11.327
Fuck yeah, man.

56:18.876 --> 56:19.710
I think you're good.

56:42.733 --> 56:44.113
<i>A lot of people, when they get married</i>

56:44.193 --> 56:48.697
<i>they register at some bullshit place,
like Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel...</i>

56:49.281 --> 56:51.662
<i>I had a friend who
works for a non-profit.</i>

56:51.742 --> 56:54.912
<i>She registered for asparagus peelers.</i>

56:57.540 --> 56:58.874
<i>Bitch, you don't have a bed frame.</i>

57:00.709 --> 57:02.586
<i>You can't afford asparagus,</i>

57:03.504 --> 57:05.381
<i>the gay uncle of broccoli.</i>

57:10.302 --> 57:13.347
<i>My husband and I, when we registered,
we registered somewhere practical.</i>

57:14.390 --> 57:15.766
<i>Kaiser Permanente.</i>

57:17.351 --> 57:19.228
<i>We got IVF treatments and pap smears.</i>

57:22.231 --> 57:23.357
Hey, what can I get you?

57:23.649 --> 57:25.401
- Can I have a Michter's, neat, please?
- Yeah.

57:25.734 --> 57:26.735
Say...

57:27.236 --> 57:28.195
Make it a beer.

57:28.571 --> 57:30.698
- Whatever's on tap.
- Okay. Be right back.

57:30.990 --> 57:34.080
<i>Last dude I dated, his little brother
worked at an ice cream truck</i>

57:34.160 --> 57:36.245
right outside of my house in New York.

57:36.787 --> 57:39.707
And every day he would
give me free ice cream.

57:40.416 --> 57:43.711
And one day he pops his head
out of the truck and he was like, "Ali,

57:44.587 --> 57:46.213
have you seen my brother?

57:47.256 --> 57:50.593
Oh, my God, you don't know this,
but he's bi-polar.

57:50.926 --> 57:52.887
And he's gone missing."

57:53.971 --> 57:56.477
And I was like, "Oh, my God."

58:00.853 --> 58:03.439
"Do I still get free ice cream?"

58:04.774 --> 58:06.567
All right, I've been Ali Wong.
Have a good night, everybody.

58:10.779 --> 58:12.239
Give it up for Ali Wong!

58:18.329 --> 58:22.082
<i>Ali just got married,
I also just got married.</i>

58:27.505 --> 58:28.801
I loved your speech, by the way.

58:28.881 --> 58:30.886
<i>Obviously... I married a woman.</i>

58:30.966 --> 58:31.884
Thanks.

58:32.551 --> 58:33.677
You have eyes on your face.

58:34.303 --> 58:36.430
This is not the haircut of a woman
who sleeps with men.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.934
You guys, we're gonna
keep the show right on rolling.

58:40.476 --> 58:43.395
If you loved Ali, you'll love this next
comic. I have known her forever.

58:43.562 --> 58:44.855
She is hilarious.

58:45.356 --> 58:47.441
Let's hear it now for Charlotte Dillon.
Give it up for her.

58:47.775 --> 58:49.568
Come on!

58:52.321 --> 58:57.284
All right, keep it going for Cameron
Esposito, our awesome host.

58:59.245 --> 59:00.079
So...

59:01.121 --> 59:02.414
I want to tell you
about my day, I had... I had...

59:03.249 --> 59:04.333
an extremely productive day.

59:05.251 --> 59:07.002
My parents would be very proud of me.

59:08.587 --> 59:11.382
Um, I met a guy, and then I fucked him.

59:11.840 --> 59:12.883
Yeah.

59:13.217 --> 59:14.385
But it's not...
but it's not what you think.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.346
I met him through someone
who's really trustworthy:

59:18.097 --> 59:18.931
my drug dealer.

59:20.724 --> 59:21.559
Oh, my God.

59:22.226 --> 59:23.727
Young guys, right?

59:24.019 --> 59:25.563
Young guys, I'm over you guys.

59:25.980 --> 59:29.775
I'm over it. The guy that
I'm fucking right now, older.

59:30.818 --> 59:34.363
Older. And I'm not talking like,
forty seven or something.

59:35.072 --> 59:38.158
I'm talking 70 plus, bitches.

59:39.034 --> 59:40.786
Oh, yeah! Oh-hoh!

59:41.453 --> 59:43.959
Full on senior citizen. Like...

59:44.039 --> 59:47.251
Allowed to withdraw
from a Roth IRA with no penalty.

59:48.335 --> 59:50.462
Remembers when TV was like
black and white and shit.

59:51.922 --> 59:53.340
But here's the thing... Older guys,

59:54.091 --> 59:55.009
they're awesome.

59:55.759 --> 59:57.970
They're awesome, they're experienced...

59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.222
you know, they know how to treat a lady.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.099
They go slow.

01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:04.393
Because they have to.

01:00:06.562 --> 01:00:10.691
But okay, can we can we just talk
about the balls for a second?

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:13.986
Right? Let's just,
we're gonna talk about it.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:15.282
I feel like we know each other now.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.865
These balls have dropped.

01:00:18.324 --> 01:00:21.035
Golf balls sitting at the bottom
of a tube sock.

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:25.122
It was actually kinda hot.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:26.957
But you know what's even hotter?

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.084
Keeping his heart rate steady.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:30.919
Serious.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.756
I mean, what's naughtier than fucking
someone who could die any second?

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.216
You know?

01:00:37.176 --> 01:00:38.010
It's like...

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:42.931
So, yesterday...

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.476
Right? Let's talk about yesterday.
Enough about today.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.652
In some ways
I've been dead for a long time.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.824
I had to... I had to change
the way I look to protect you.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:44.868
I did die.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.246
I had to go.

01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:49.336
I'm leaving.

01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:50.416
I'm your father.

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:53.502
And I'm here to...

01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:55.629
I'm your father.

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:09.852
Mr. Hayden.

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:11.770
We're ready for you.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.693
Hey! There he is.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:20.404
Good to see you, buddy.

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:22.451
Thanks for coming
in on such short notice.

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:23.615
Thanks for having me.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.076
All right.

01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:28.162
I'm sorry about all the bother.

01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:31.206
It's just that everybody's
reading for this movie.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:33.083
No matter how big.

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:35.294
It's just the way this studio wants it.

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:36.712
I hope you understand.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.798
No bother at all. I'm happy to do it.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:44.803
Great. Okay, well...
shall we just jump in?

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:45.846
Sure.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.391
- Uh, you need sides, or...
- Nope.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.059
Ready to go.

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:53.437
Yeah? Okay.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:56.440
Um, you'll be reading with Linda.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:59.943
And, uh... let's begin.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:07.201
Who are you?

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:10.370
My name's Turner.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:12.539
Turner?

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.250
That's right.

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:19.630
I'm here to help you.

01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:21.256
Why?

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:23.509
Because I'm your father.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:29.473
I'm here to help you.

01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:31.725
Why?

01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:33.769
Because you're my daughter.

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:48.659
My father? You're not my father.

01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:56.500
I'm sorry.

01:03:57.543 --> 01:03:58.836
Could I get the sides actually?

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Of course, you can.

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:03.465
Here. Here you go, buddy.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.180
I'm so sorry, I had this down.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.219
I'm so sorry.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.221
Take your time, it's totally fine.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:10.769
Thank you.

01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:12.140
Yeah, don't worry about it, Lee.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.895
You just... Just take your time.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:26.488
Listen to me, if we don't go now
we're as good as dead.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.241
But you're not my father.

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:32.035
My father is dead.
He died a long time ago.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:38.083
It's me.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.044
You don't even look like him.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:42.963
I had to change the way I look.

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:45.507
To protect you.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:51.972
I did die.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:07.529
I did die.

01:05:17.748 --> 01:05:18.916
Shit.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.793
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh...

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:26.423
- I'm so sorry.
- No, Lee, it's okay.

01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:30.472
It's okay. Look, we'll go back.
Let's, let's go back.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:31.473
Let's go back to...

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:32.763
God damn it!

01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:34.306
I'm so sorry.

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:36.934
I apologize. I wasted your time.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.525
Hey, hey. Mr. Hayden.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.570
Lee Hayden. How's it going, buddy?

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:49.659
Not now, man.

01:05:49.739 --> 01:05:52.616
We all saw that video of your speech, man.
It was absolutely amazing.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.952
Just happy, out of control.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.870
- Not now.
- Listen...

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:58.750
Are you here for another western?

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.332
You're going to be
doing another western, aren't ya?

01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:02.376
It's gonna be great.
We'd love to see you on it.

01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:03.506
How did the audition go?

01:06:03.586 --> 01:06:05.215
Get the fuck out of my face!

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:06.925
Jesus Christ! Relax, man.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:08.006
Just get the fuck away from me.

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.895
<i>Hi, this is Lucy. Leave a message.</i>

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:35.607
I had to do that act, Lee.

01:10:38.485 --> 01:10:41.404
I had to do it to try to make
sense of whatever this is.

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:46.534
You know I don't actually feel that way.

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:54.834
But you can't help who you like.

01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:59.297
I'm feeling really sorry
that I hurt you because I didn't...

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:04.678
I do like you.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:08.139
So, I'm sorry.

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:13.937
Nothing I said up there
changes how I feel about you.

01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:30.662
I'm dying.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.835
I got cancer and I'm fucking dying.

01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:03.069
Cancer's not a death sentence anymore.

01:12:04.195 --> 01:12:05.196
Just so you know.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.621
Apparently, the one I have
is one of the worst you can hope for.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.757
What does your oncologist say?

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:27.594
Like surgery?

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:32.557
Radiation, or chemo?

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:39.189
Is it untreatable?

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.320
There's a procedure.

01:12:49.074 --> 01:12:50.158
Not a cure.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.538
It can buy a few more years.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.545
I just don't know if it's worth it.

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:08.885
Worth it?

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:13.515
Buying time.

01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:22.107
Jesus Christ, Lee. You're dying.
It's all about buying time.

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:27.404
Yeah.

01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:33.076
I just haven't figured what I wanna do.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:38.832
What does your family say?

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:42.627
I haven't told my family.

01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:46.381
Are you serious?

01:13:49.134 --> 01:13:50.427
I haven't told anyone.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:53.596
Just you.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.194
You need to tell your family.

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:14.033
And you need to get that procedure.

01:14:17.162 --> 01:14:17.996
Okay?

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:23.668
Tell me you're gonna do it.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:28.965
I will.

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:33.678
You need to promise me.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.771
I promise.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:51.237
Okay.

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:03.333
I almost forgot...

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:06.252
I got you something.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:08.087
You got me something?

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:09.547
Why?

01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:12.091
It was the fucking reason
I came over here, man.

01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:13.593
My ruse.

01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:22.018
I don't know what to say.

01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:23.811
Maybe "thanks."

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:26.272
Open it.

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:43.915
Thank you.

01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.565
<i>Hi, this is Lucy. Leave a message.</i>

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:12.068
Hey, Lucy, it's Lee.

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:13.403
It's your dad.

01:16:15.113 --> 01:16:16.239
Look, I know you're upset.

01:16:16.531 --> 01:16:18.116
And you have every right to be.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:20.285
I screwed up.

01:16:21.703 --> 01:16:22.912
But I guess you're used to that.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:26.958
Listen...

01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:30.253
please call me back.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:35.633
I need to talk to you.
I have something I want to tell you.

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:16.591
These are very you.

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:19.552
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:23.806
Is Lucy here?

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:25.933
She was earlier.

01:17:28.728 --> 01:17:29.979
Did she tell you what happened?

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:35.902
I fucked up, Val.

01:17:42.909 --> 01:17:44.243
I've got something I wanna tell you.

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:54.379
I've... um...

01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:05.908
Hello?

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:24.135
How sick are you?

01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:27.889
I guess it's pretty bad.

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:37.857
Were you ever gonna tell me?

01:19:41.319 --> 01:19:42.445
How long have you known?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.003
I don't know why you go out
of your way to be so difficult.

01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:06.302
You know that, right?
You know how selfish you can be?

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:11.057
You were always away.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.854
And even when you weren't
I was always very aware

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:18.940
that you were in the process of leaving.

01:20:22.902 --> 01:20:24.028
And what are you doing now?

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:31.914
And the only reason we're even talking
is because you wanna die

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.329
on good terms or something.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:34.834
Is there something wrong with that?

01:20:34.914 --> 01:20:36.958
You don't deserve it, Lee.

01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:42.630
You can't just decide to fix things.

01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:47.343
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:50.346
Just die and that's it?

01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:51.722
Over and done?

01:20:53.808 --> 01:20:54.725
Would you prefer that?

01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:01.524
I wanna get past this.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.531
I wanna get to the next thing.

01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:15.705
So, what is the next thing, Lee?

01:21:17.582 --> 01:21:18.457
I don't know.

01:21:21.294 --> 01:21:23.379
I just know there's got to be another...

01:21:28.259 --> 01:21:29.802
Will you just give me a chance?

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.892
Give me a chance to
write another chapter.

01:21:45.776 --> 01:21:48.070
I remember holding hands
with you on this beach.

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.160
I held up our hands and I said,

01:21:56.662 --> 01:22:00.333
"Your hand is old, and it has wrinkles."

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:05.466
Then I turned our hands over and I said,

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:07.506
"My hand is new and doesn't
have any wrinkles."

01:22:15.765 --> 01:22:17.683
I thought you left because
I hurt your feelings.

01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:27.735
And I believed that for years.

01:22:34.784 --> 01:22:35.743
I'm so sorry.

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.547
It really is beautiful out here.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:57.223
Yes, it is.

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.084
<i>Dr. Friedburg's office.</i>

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:28.541
I'd like to make an appointment.

01:25:28.999 --> 01:25:30.000
<i>Please hold.</i>

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.015
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:28.517
<i>You said you'd like to make
an appointment, is that right?</i>

01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:32.275
This is all you need?

01:26:32.355 --> 01:26:33.731
That's it.

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:38.652
Hey, I got the Ultimate
Buster Keaton on Blu-ray.

01:26:39.403 --> 01:26:40.446
Wanna stick around?

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.449
We could order some Chinese chicken salads.

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:46.702
Yeah, I've got some
stuff I'm working on.

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:48.329
Next time, though.

01:26:48.746 --> 01:26:49.622
Yeah.

01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:52.124
How've you been feeling?

01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:58.255
Oh, I meant to tell you.

01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:02.596
<i>I found some episodes of Cattle Drive
online last night.</i>

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:03.848
I watched a bunch of them.

01:27:03.928 --> 01:27:04.970
How were they?

01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:06.096
Amazing.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.098
You remember that scene we had?

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:12.311
You catch me stealing a horse, and
you're about to beat the shit out of me,

01:27:12.645 --> 01:27:15.397
and I tell you I'm an orphan,
and you take pity on me.

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:19.526
Then in the next episode,
they fucking hang me,

01:27:20.069 --> 01:27:22.321
and that sends you on
a revenge killing spree.

01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:26.367
My death was the whole
reason for that show, man.

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:44.718
Hey there.

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:46.762
Hey.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.555
How's it going?

01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:54.478
Happy birthday.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:00.985
I got you something.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:03.445
Hold on.

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:13.080
Yeah.

01:28:14.707 --> 01:28:15.708
Did you ever read it?

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.043
'Cause it was under the bed.

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:24.008
You know, I used to wanna be a poet.

01:28:25.676 --> 01:28:29.805
Like, that was what I wanted to be more
than anything in the world.

01:28:32.308 --> 01:28:34.852
You sit down, because you're
gonna listen to this poem.

01:28:46.113 --> 01:28:49.575
"Dirge Without Music,"
by Edna St. Vincent Millay.

01:28:53.412 --> 01:28:56.040
"I am not resigned to the shutting away

01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:58.375
"of loving hearts in the hard ground.

01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:04.173
"So it is, and so it will be,
for so it has been,

01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:06.175
"time out of mind:

01:29:09.303 --> 01:29:10.512
"into the darkness they go,

01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:13.390
"the wise and the lovely.

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:16.685
"Crowned with lilies and laurel they go;

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:19.480
"but I am not resigned.

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.901
"Lovers and thinkers,
into the earth with you.

01:29:24.193 --> 01:29:28.072
"Be one with the dull,
the indiscriminate dust.

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:33.869
"A fragment of what you felt,
of what you knew,

01:29:35.913 --> 01:29:39.795
"a formula, a phrase remains...
but the best is lost.

01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:45.089
"The answers quick and keen,
the honest look,

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:47.758
"the laughter, the love...

01:29:49.259 --> 01:29:50.386
"They are gone.

01:29:51.804 --> 01:29:53.305
"They are gone to feed the roses.

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:56.475
Elegant and curled is the blossom.

01:29:57.309 --> 01:29:59.478
"Fragrant is the blossom. I know.

01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:01.313
"But I do not approve.

01:30:03.399 --> 01:30:06.693
"More precious was the light in your eyes
than all the roses in the world.

01:30:09.363 --> 01:30:12.491
"Down, down, down into
the darkness of the grave,

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:18.622
"Gently they go, the beautiful,
the tender, the kind;

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.376
"Quietly they go, the intelligent,

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:24.753
"the witty, and the brave.

01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:26.130
"I know.

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:30.717
But I do not approve.
And I am not resigned."

01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:15.220
The new sweet and spicy
Lonestar Barbecue sauce,

01:31:15.888 --> 01:31:18.515
the perfect partner for your ribs.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:25.105
The new sweet and spicy
Lonestar Barbecue sauce,

01:31:26.023 --> 01:31:28.817
the perfect partner for your ribs.

01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:31.737
That was great, Lee.
