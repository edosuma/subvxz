WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:06.076
There. Just a tiny splinter.

00:06.160 --> 00:09.152
It's funny. I can't stop thinking
about Aesop's Fables.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.755
You know the one where the lion's
always hassling the little mouse?

00:12.840 --> 00:15.035
Then the mouse
pulls a thorn from his paw?

00:15.120 --> 00:17.953
Right, and the lion
kills him anyway. Yeah.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.838
- No, he doesn't.
- Trust me.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.469
- Sandy, let's start work.
- Sandy isn't necessarily a girl's name.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.039
- Short for Sandra.
- Clear.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.792
Hello, Perry.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.395
- Oh, God, the ex-wife.
- Jordan. What a coincidence!

00:31.480 --> 00:33.835
You were in my dream.
I can't say for certain,

00:33.920 --> 00:37.708
but I was having the flesh torn from
my bones by a cross-eyed water snake.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.916
- You, right?
- Yes. Yeah.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.072
Let's play a game. I'll throw out
an adjective describing

00:44.160 --> 00:47.197
how one of you is in bed,
and you guess who it is.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.396
Remember, I had no idea
she was your ex.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.311
- OK. Clumsy.
- Don't answer that.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.233
No worries.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.639
Goodbye, Jordan.

00:55.720 --> 00:56.994
Sandy.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.673
- Good job, DJ.
- You know, it's JD.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.752
At least I remember the names
of all my sexual partners.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.833
I'm sure that girl from high school and
your bunkmate from Camp Morning Wood

01:07.920 --> 01:10.480
are both extremely grateful. Yeah.

01:11.840 --> 01:16.072
Camp Meadow Wood.
I made a lanyard.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.080 --> 01:42.958
It sounds insensitive,
but hospitals can be boring.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.396
If a policeman gets into an accident
with a bad guy he's chasing,

01:46.480 --> 01:47.629
it pumps you up.

01:47.720 --> 01:50.951
OK, move it along, fellas,
there's nothing to see here.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.871
I'll be over here.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.872
Officer Berson,
shortness of breath and chest pain.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.997
Think anyone else gets
this excited over a car accident?

02:04.680 --> 02:06.193
Maybe Hank.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.271
We weren't the only ones
psyched to be in the game.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.999
The doctor is in.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.992
Bad guy, this is why
you don't run from the police.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.877
Baby, are you ready to rock?

02:16.960 --> 02:20.077
Right. Another cocky resident
that wants to start surgery

02:20.160 --> 02:22.116
before the attending shows up.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.397
I just figured that
if we finished here quick enough,

02:25.480 --> 02:28.278
we might have time
to pull the stick out of your ass.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.316
What do you say?

02:31.240 --> 02:34.437
- Perry!
- Beelze-Bob.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.397
- Lackey!
- Hey, Dr Cox.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.278
I'm being honoured tonight
by the board of trustees.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.920
- They asked me to say a few words.
- Yawn.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.709
Anyway, I'd like you
to be the one who introduces me.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.828
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.832
- Not interested.
- I didn't ask if you were interested.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.354
I deeply dislike you.
It keeps me up at night.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.557
Then use that passion.
Put that rage on the page.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.950
Here's an idea.
Why not use Big Chief Flop Sweat here?

03:01.280 --> 03:03.953
Ted's not an impressive man.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.429
- Hey, that... He's right.
- You're OK.

03:08.520 --> 03:12.957
You have a slight arrhythmia, so Dr
Dorian and I will monitor you closely.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.871
But don't worry.
We're on top of it.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.555
There's nothing like that feeling
of taking charge of a situation.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.835
Mary, Rhoda, chart, please.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.676
What, I stutter? Give me the chart.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.515
Attagirl. Oh, man.
I don't like his O2 cells.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.113
Get me a doughnut, will you?

03:30.200 --> 03:32.509
You mean like a...
a blood pressure thingy?

03:32.600 --> 03:35.717
I mean a glazed thingy.
And I like sprinkles on half of it.

03:35.800 --> 03:41.318
If you can't find a half-sprinkle, get
all-sprinkles and pick half of 'em off.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.675
You know, that was kind of demeaning.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.638
You're right. Would you apologise to her
while you get me some coffee?

03:48.720 --> 03:53.191
And be quick or I'll have the manager
send over a different waitress. Go.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.236
You're done now. Yeah.

03:56.360 --> 04:00.353
The frustrating thing was down in OR,
Turk was probably running the show.

04:00.880 --> 04:05.715
Steady, Dr Turk,
only about two more hours.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.995
Can you just scratch my nose, please?

04:08.080 --> 04:11.959
No, I can scratch my nose.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.912
Oh, that feels good.

04:23.520 --> 04:28.150
Miss Sullivan, I want to thank you and
the rest of the board for this award.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.834
The fact your first choice
passed away last week,

04:30.920 --> 04:32.876
in no way makes it
any less special.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.155
Are you sure?
Cos it seems like it does.

04:35.240 --> 04:40.712
Bob, as far as the intro thing goes,
I've given it a great deal of thought,

04:40.800 --> 04:45.237
but I'm afraid I'm gonna politely have
to tell you to blow it out your ass.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.675
I think we both understand
how this works.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.911
It's like when my dog Baxter
goes winkle on the carpet.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.912
He always heads straight away
from the tool shed,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.072
but we both know
that's where he's gonna spend the night.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.230
- Charming story.
- Yeah.

04:59.320 --> 05:03.279
The fact is I make it a rule
never to get in bed with people

05:03.360 --> 05:06.272
that I have nothing but contempt for.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.393
- That feels good, JD.
- What?

05:14.320 --> 05:18.279
- You'll now pay for that.
- God, I hope so.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.635
We're residents now. We're supposed
to have more responsibility.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.349
I scratched my nose
with Bad Guy's toe.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.750
Accept the fact we're the most
underappreciated people here.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.115
- Bambi, I really feel for you.
- Thank you.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.997
She doesn't.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.310
I spend my time getting orders
barked at me

05:36.400 --> 05:40.075
by people who take credit for my work
and blame me for their mistakes.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.628
And I'm expected
to hold the doctor's hand.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.871
You should try trading places
with me for one day.

05:47.640 --> 05:52.589
It's actually not that bad. And the lace
feels soft against my package.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.039
Nah.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.908
I'm glad we finally
had a chance to talk.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.151
You and me both.
I haven't had anyone to talk to lately.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.073
- Well, OK.
- But, boy, you sure talk fast.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.195
Bye-bye.

06:06.280 --> 06:10.034
Next time we talk,
maybe I could finish a sentence or two.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.954
You still like her.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.112
Why? Because we had
a conversation in an empty room?

06:19.200 --> 06:21.077
That room's not empty.

06:24.240 --> 06:28.233
Listen, girlfriend, I don't want to hear
your misguided romantic notions.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.710
Cos you see, for me,
sex is a sport, like racquetball.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.995
Play hard for half an hour,
work up a sweat,

06:34.080 --> 06:37.675
- and hope you don't get hit in the eye.
- I know you care about her.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.594
In fact, I bet that after you two
are done playing racquetball or talking

06:41.680 --> 06:43.875
or whatever you crazy kids
are calling it,

06:43.960 --> 06:48.238
you'd like nothing better than to
just lie there and watch her sleep.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.074
It's impossible to actually lie
next to Jordan seeing as she sleeps

06:52.160 --> 06:56.915
hanging upside down from the ceiling
wrapped in a cocoon of her own wings.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.275
That's nice.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.238
I thought about what you said
and you're right, I owe you.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.197
So I got you a date tonight.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.430
- Who?
- Tim.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.314
- I'm not gay.
- What?

07:12.400 --> 07:16.359
Oh, OK, I get it. Neither's Tim.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.871
Unfortunately, I'm on call tonight.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.635
As weird as this place is during
the day, it's even worse at night.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.836
That's when
all the weirdos come out.

07:26.920 --> 07:31.630
Like the ER doctor who likes to work
nights cos he says he 's up anyway.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.517
Hey, bro'.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.509
Or the nurse who everyone agrees
is just a little bit off.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.114
Or if there 's a full moon...

07:41.200 --> 07:45.193
Hey. This is my band. We all work in
different departments in the hospital.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.918
You told me last time we...

07:47.000 --> 07:48.319
- Legal
- Accounting

07:48.400 --> 07:49.719
Shipping and receiving

07:49.800 --> 07:52.758
On-site property management,
including pest control

07:52.840 --> 07:55.832
Night-time security,
non-arboreal gardening services

07:55.920 --> 07:58.878
And tenant-related easements and liens

07:58.960 --> 08:01.235
- You got promoted.
- It's about time

08:01.320 --> 08:04.392
He's been busting his hump
around here for six years

08:05.880 --> 08:08.030
Dr Kelso lets us practise
here at night.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.475
Oh, yeah, I remember.
Cartoon theme songs.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.269
No, no, no. That was lame.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.999
We do prime-time now.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.439
What attendings
are stuck here on call tonight?

09:06.520 --> 09:09.353
- Everyone's at that Kelso thing.
- I think Dr Cox is on.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.318
He went home,
but said that Carol could cover for him.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.960
Is Carol the one
with the really firm butt?

09:15.040 --> 09:16.792
Well, I'm Carol, so yes.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.678
It's disturbing how obsessed
you are with your butt.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.672
You're missing the point.
No one is here tonight but us.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.433
- We are running this hospital.
- This is our house.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.398
- We're in charge.
- I love my butt.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.439
It's amazing how, one moment, you
think you know exactly what you want.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.278
Oh, God. Come on.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.396
The next moment
everyhing changes.

09:38.480 --> 09:42.598
OK, Elliot, the ER doctor
knows there's no attending up here

09:42.680 --> 09:47.276
so instead of treating he's admitting
everyone. You've got 1 2 so far.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.592
Turk, oncology, cardiology
and paediatrics all need consults.

09:51.680 --> 09:55.195
That phone's for you. It's the clinic.
They know you're on your own

09:55.280 --> 09:57.748
so they're patching
all night-calls through.

09:57.840 --> 10:02.038
And Bambi, room 201 needs an art line,
room 202 needs reintubation,

10:02.120 --> 10:04.190
plus, Carol, you're needed in lCU

10:04.280 --> 10:07.033
to place a femoral swan
under fluro on Mr Freed.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.078
Never actually done
one of these unsupervised before.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.037
You'll be fine.

10:12.960 --> 10:18.034
That's when I realised, tonight we
really were alone. Running the hospital.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.639
Luckily, someone
had the guts to take charge.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.349
You've all been on call before.
So you don't have a safety net.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.512
Most of the time
you don't need one anyway, right?

10:48.600 --> 10:52.718
Fine, I'll tell your patients they're on
their own because you're too scared.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.872
No, Carla, I'm a doctor.
I should tell them.

10:55.960 --> 10:59.589
Come on, peeps,
let's go kick some sick patient ass.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.151
That, my friends,
is one nerdy honky.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.475
That's two.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.718
- My back hurts.
- Oh, yeah?

11:13.800 --> 11:15.677
Well, my front hurts, so touché.

11:15.760 --> 11:19.309
Always a charmer. Hi.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.791
Hi. I'm gonna go and get you
a big ice-cold glass of water.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.598
What do you think of that?

11:25.680 --> 11:30.117
Oh, sweet mother of mercy, Carla,
you were right, you were so right.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.953
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Duck.

11:33.040 --> 11:37.352
Who paged me cos a patient thinks
their tongue is too spongy? Who?

11:37.440 --> 11:40.318
Under no circumstances
tell any of them that I'm here.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.676
Yeah, look. Just go home
and tell Jordan how you feel.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.911
- Tell a woman how I feel?
- Well, I guess you could... Duck.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.152
This is ridiculous. He admitted him
to cardiology because he has heartburn.

11:51.240 --> 11:55.199
- I hate ER docs.
- You don't understand my relationship.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.679
Duck.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.952
Now that's just not funny.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.518
I don't know why I was scared
of placing a femoral swan.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.275
I guess I couldn't stop wishing
there was someone over my shoulder.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.113
I was even starting to see things.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.556
OK, Mr Freed, I think I can do this.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.756
I'm gonna need a C-arm in here.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.958
- Want me to knock him out?
- What are you doing in here?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.075
Helping you out.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.835
This isn't like being a janitor.
It's not something everybody can do.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.798
Oh, so you can do my stuff,
but I can't do yours?

12:29.880 --> 12:31.233
Yes!

12:31.320 --> 12:35.313
OK, hotshot, what would you use to get
a coffee stain off a tiled floor?

12:36.040 --> 12:39.032
I don't know.
The rough side of a sponge?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.911
Damn it.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.436
Officer Berson's spiralling a bit.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.990
Pulmonary edema seems secondary
to acute mitral regurgitation.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.435
If it is a flail leaflet,
he'll need surgery.

12:54.520 --> 12:58.433
His vitals are so weak, I wouldn't
be confident taking him to the OR.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.318
The classic Catch-22
between medical and surgical.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.591
Somebody needs to be decisive.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.389
- OK, here's the plan. We do nothing.
- Sounds good.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.675
- I'm in.
- That's inspiring.

13:09.760 --> 13:12.911
Meet in a few hours to see
if his vitals have improved.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.871
Yeah, this ends now.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.191
Turk should've known that
the worst mistake a doctor can make

13:21.280 --> 13:24.590
is setting foot in the hospital's
free clinic, at night.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.070
I don't care if you shave down there.
That's not a medical issue.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.469
But it sure is pretty.

13:30.560 --> 13:35.190
Ma'am, you don't have mono.
But you do have halitosis. Mint?

13:35.280 --> 13:39.193
Ma'am, three baby Tylenol is actually
an underdose for a woman your size.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.433
Yes, congratulations,
you are double-jointed.

13:45.720 --> 13:51.238
You can see we don't have any more beds
and we can't handle any more patients.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.630
OK, you talk way too fast.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.713
If you could just keep one person
downstairs, we'd throw a parade for you.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.710
She needs you to give her a break.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.713
Oh, well, tell her
we're really swamped.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.836
- She can understand you.
- Yeah.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.198
Well, then, understand this.
Chill out, bitty.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.268
Didn't you go to get water,
like, an hour ago?

14:20.360 --> 14:24.672
More or less. Jordan, there's something
I really want to say to you.

14:24.760 --> 14:28.036
Say it while I'm drinking water.
Because I'm dying of thirst.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.997
I like you... again.

14:30.640 --> 14:34.679
There. You win. You can do your
victory dance or slaughter a goat,

14:34.760 --> 14:36.990
or whatever it is you do
when you're happy.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.399
You don't like me.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.392
- I watch you sleep.
- That gives me the heebie-jeebies.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.995
I can't stop thinking
about putting up with you.

14:45.080 --> 14:49.198
Look, this is pointless,
angry, shallow sex.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.748
Why would you go and ruin
something like that?

14:51.840 --> 14:55.071
I'm real sorry,
but that's not enough for me anymore.

14:55.160 --> 15:00.871
Sweetie, I have feelings for you too,
but, unlike you, I have some balls,

15:00.960 --> 15:03.349
so you don't hear me
whining about it.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.518
Look, Perry,
I can't let you back into my life,

15:08.600 --> 15:11.876
and watch you personally
and professionally sabotage

15:11.960 --> 15:14.030
every single chance that you get.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.792
It's too hard. I can't do it.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.110
But I have changed. I have.

15:18.200 --> 15:23.320
I see a shrink now. I actually see two,
to tell you the truth.

15:23.400 --> 15:28.030
Good God, what do you want me to do
to prove that I'm not that guy anymore?

15:31.960 --> 15:35.669
There you are.
Had to make me sweat, didn't you?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.751
Good for you, buckaroo.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.037
I took the liberty
of writing out my introduction.

15:41.120 --> 15:45.113
"Bob Kelso is the love of my life."

15:45.200 --> 15:47.270
My wife was going to do it.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.636
She doesn't even seem to be here.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.711
What are you gonna do?

15:52.560 --> 15:53.788
Lovely.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.717
You rang?

15:58.800 --> 15:59.949
Lurch.

16:00.040 --> 16:04.318
My stethoscope is stuck up there
and I need you to get it down for me.

16:05.560 --> 16:09.439
- You put it up there.
- That's really neither here nor there.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.273
- Fine. Right. We're even.
- Oh, thank God.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.557
You could've just asked me
to stop hassling you for a year.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.518
- OK, I want that, then.
- It's too late.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.840
But I use those for listening.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.308
They want you upstairs in room...

16:29.560 --> 16:31.790
...208.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.231
His vitals are the same. There's got
to be one attending in this hospital.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.869
- You guys are unbelievable.
- Thank you, baby.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.837
- Not the good kind.
- I know.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.115
You claim
you want more responsibility,

16:46.200 --> 16:49.590
but you're being outsmarted by a doctor
with scrubs made of hemp.

16:49.680 --> 16:53.275
You're afraid to stand up to a
volunteer who's answering the phones.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.510
And did you ever
place that femoral swan?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.272
It's on my to-do list.

16:57.360 --> 17:00.909
I know you were hoping Officer Berson's
vitals would go up or down

17:01.000 --> 17:06.869
and this decision would be made for you,
but nothing's changed. So it's on you.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.952
We all knew what we had to do.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.190
Surgery.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.838
Sometimes just making
a decision is half the battle.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.350
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
We have the T echnology.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.635
We can make him better
than he was before.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.109
Better, stronger, faster.

17:44.400 --> 17:48.598
Your shinunununununs could be louder.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.716
You guys were fine.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.719
Good evening, everybody.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.276
Bob Kelso is...

18:00.040 --> 18:04.477
In moments of truth,
we always reveal who we really are.

18:05.680 --> 18:09.389
Bob Kelso is an awful, awful man.

18:17.800 --> 18:23.670
I'm not joking. He's the devil.
What's wrong with you people? This is...

18:23.760 --> 18:27.753
Great stuff, Perry, great stuff.
Is this guy a hoot or what?

18:28.400 --> 18:31.472
- I'll get your ass for this.
- Jordan.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.439
Thank you.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.554
Sometimes
we're our own worst enemy.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.236
And sometimes we rise to the occasion.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.039
Everything went really well.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.709
Even though we know
that tomorrow morning,

18:51.800 --> 18:55.349
the three of us will go back to being
the most unappreciated people

18:55.440 --> 18:58.159
in the whole damn hospital.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.118
What you doing here?
I thought you were off last night.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.397
I switched shifts to help some friends.
Have a good one.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.596
Guys, wait up.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.755
Shut the hell up,
Ted, it's morning.
