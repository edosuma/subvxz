09:32.753 --> 09:35.170
I, uh, ran into Harry.

09:35.543 --> 09:36.776
Wow.

09:38.157 --> 09:40.121
- I didn't see that coming.
- Yeah.

09:40.146 --> 09:43.215
They were leaving as I was walking in.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.287
- "They"?
- Mm-hmm.

09:45.312 --> 09:48.782
It was him and some woman.

09:52.047 --> 09:53.337
Good for him.

09:53.674 --> 09:55.009
You're not bothered?

09:55.059 --> 09:57.392
- Not bothered.
- [Chuckles]

09:58.971 --> 10:01.273
All right. Mm. [Smooches]

10:03.165 --> 10:04.783
And your night?

10:06.581 --> 10:08.381
It was good, actually.

10:09.821 --> 10:11.412
I had an epiphany.

10:11.437 --> 10:13.941
Yeah? About what?

10:15.583 --> 10:17.117
[Doorbell rings]

10:17.142 --> 10:18.400
[Sighs]

10:19.781 --> 10:20.878
April!

10:20.903 --> 10:24.124
Hi, Samantha. I'm so sorry
to show up unannounced.

10:24.149 --> 10:25.282
Oh, not at all.

10:25.307 --> 10:26.440
I'm just headed out for a seaweed wrap.

10:26.465 --> 10:27.477
Can we walk and talk?

10:28.226 --> 10:29.440
Sure.

10:29.465 --> 10:30.532
Great.

10:31.452 --> 10:33.723
There's no easy way to say it.

10:34.416 --> 10:37.688
It was so kind of you to
offer this purse to Lucy.

10:37.713 --> 10:41.516
But we really can't accept
it. I hope you understand.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.677
Oh, God. I knew it. I am so sorry.

10:44.702 --> 10:46.169
I was cleaning out my closet,

10:46.194 --> 10:48.329
and Lucy just lit up when she saw it.

10:48.354 --> 10:49.787
Will you accept my apology?

10:50.023 --> 10:52.990
Oh, of course. I'm just
glad you understand.

10:53.015 --> 10:54.482
Oh, please.

10:54.507 --> 10:56.735
Half the time I don't
know if I'm spoiling Peyton

10:56.760 --> 10:58.026
or not giving her enough.

10:58.277 --> 11:00.312
It seems like she hates me either way.

11:00.384 --> 11:02.734
I bet sweet Lucy is not like that with you.

11:02.847 --> 11:05.147
- Only every day.
- [Laughs]

11:05.172 --> 11:08.973
Oh, I'm just so glad our
girls are becoming friends.

11:08.998 --> 11:10.832
We should make an effort to hang out more.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.803
You're right. We should.

11:13.828 --> 11:14.961
What are you doing tonight?

11:15.134 --> 11:16.601
Uh, tonight, I don't know.

11:16.626 --> 11:18.305
My boyfriend is getting back in town.

11:18.330 --> 11:19.656
The artist?

11:20.109 --> 11:21.411
Daniel. Yeah.

11:21.436 --> 11:24.904
Lucy showed me his website.
His work is just gorgeous.

11:24.929 --> 11:26.320
Why don't you bring him over for dinner?

11:26.345 --> 11:27.812
It'll be just the four of us.

11:27.837 --> 11:29.456
Oh, I don't want to put you out.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.715
It's no bother!

11:30.754 --> 11:33.053
Our girls are gonna be
spending so much time together,

11:33.082 --> 11:35.207
we should be getting to
know each other too, right?

11:35.575 --> 11:38.368
You know what? I'd love to.

11:38.424 --> 11:40.185
[Chuckles] Great. I'll see you tonight.

11:40.210 --> 11:41.210
Okay.

11:42.221 --> 11:43.628
Dom: Savi.

11:43.857 --> 11:45.972
Savi, come on.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.794
I could see it on your
face. You hate the idea.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.776
I don't hate the idea at all.

11:51.801 --> 11:52.888
Look, I...

11:53.025 --> 11:54.926
[Sighs] I don't know if I'm ready.

11:54.951 --> 11:56.395
You were ready before.

11:56.439 --> 11:58.839
Yeah, of course I was on board before.

11:58.864 --> 12:00.557
Y-you were already pregnant!

12:00.703 --> 12:02.169
You know, it... it was happening.

12:02.194 --> 12:04.355
It... It was real.

12:04.842 --> 12:07.124
But you have to admit, it
wasn't exactly a dream scenario.

12:07.245 --> 12:08.289
Okay.

12:08.314 --> 12:10.182
Then what is the dream scenario?

12:10.346 --> 12:12.639
Well, that we move in together.

12:13.889 --> 12:15.690
Not your place or mine, but

12:16.154 --> 12:19.432
a new place that we both love.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.240
And then we would get married.

12:24.388 --> 12:27.809
And we'd take at least one
incredibly extravagant trip

12:27.834 --> 12:29.868
that we couldn't take with kids.

12:30.402 --> 12:35.208
And then we would come
home to start our family.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.661
When did you come up with this plan?

12:41.686 --> 12:44.488
During our first case
that we were on together.

12:45.649 --> 12:48.162
Kept having these crazy
thoughts like, uh...

12:48.843 --> 12:51.606
"Wouldn't it be amazing

12:52.505 --> 12:54.439
to have a life with that woman?"

12:55.893 --> 12:57.208
And here we are.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.683
I'm finally where I want to be, you know?

13:00.708 --> 13:03.111
In my career, with you.

13:03.889 --> 13:04.952
I don't know, I just...

13:04.977 --> 13:08.473
I feel like the plan is
finally falling into place.

13:09.811 --> 13:11.278
Make sense?

13:12.140 --> 13:13.630
Perfect sense.

13:25.119 --> 13:27.780
Um, you're, like, glowing.

13:29.089 --> 13:30.611
What's happening with you?

13:31.194 --> 13:32.633
[Gulps] What do you mean?

13:32.658 --> 13:34.463
You're looser and shinier.

13:34.488 --> 13:36.347
Something's going on.
Are you dating someone?

13:36.372 --> 13:37.439
No!

13:38.013 --> 13:40.555
I have a new face cream.
It does a dewy thing.

13:40.580 --> 13:41.594
Mm-hmm.

13:41.619 --> 13:44.373
Daniel missed his flight. He
won't be back until tomorrow.

13:44.398 --> 13:47.006
I'm sure you can live
without him for one more day.

13:47.031 --> 13:48.053
It's not that.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.245
But now I have to cancel
dinner with Peyton's parents.

13:50.434 --> 13:53.310
- Why?
- I am not showing up alone.

13:53.382 --> 13:56.028
Have you forgotten that I went
on a date with Peyton's father?

13:56.053 --> 13:57.132
[Chuckles]

13:57.584 --> 13:59.409
[Laughing] No, of course not!

13:59.582 --> 14:02.017
I literally told a
hundred people that story.

14:02.151 --> 14:03.339
- You...
- What? I'm kidding!

14:03.364 --> 14:05.332
- [Laughs]
- Sort of. What?

14:05.357 --> 14:07.734
Honey, it's gonna be awkward
if Daniel shows up or not.

14:07.796 --> 14:09.247
You just got to push through the pain.

14:09.272 --> 14:10.806
[Laughs] Yeah. I'm canceling.

14:10.831 --> 14:12.798
I hate to side with Joss as a rule,

14:12.823 --> 14:14.682
but I think she's right about this.

14:14.707 --> 14:17.562
[Scoffs] She thinks I should
have let Lucy keep the Gucci!

14:17.587 --> 14:20.532
Hey, I never said that. I said that
you should keep it and give it to me.

14:20.557 --> 14:22.052
I think Lucy's very aware

14:22.077 --> 14:24.379
of where you're making an
effort and where you're not.

14:24.404 --> 14:26.407
Her best friend's parents
asked you over for dinner.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.931
You should go for her sake.

14:29.483 --> 14:31.866
We all agree it's gonna be horrible, right?

14:31.891 --> 14:33.625
- Absolutely.
- Worst night ever.

14:33.650 --> 14:35.350
Thank you. I hate you both.

14:40.561 --> 14:42.546
Oh. Hey. Sorry, I didn't
know you were here.

14:42.571 --> 14:44.235
- I would have knocked.
- Kate: No worries.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.793
Harry's just gone to get a taco

14:45.818 --> 14:47.426
that will apparently change my life.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.730
- Oh, yeah?
- Although I don't really think

14:48.755 --> 14:50.233
a taco could do that to a person.

14:50.258 --> 14:51.525
Oh, no, no. This one can. Trust me.

14:51.550 --> 14:52.984
I turned him on to them.

14:53.469 --> 14:55.102
So, I'm just gonna drop some stuff off

14:55.127 --> 14:58.185
for him to take a look at...
just ideas for our next gig.

14:59.546 --> 15:01.635
Actually, it's probably our last gig, huh?

15:01.926 --> 15:03.773
[Sighs] I can't believe that he's leaving.

15:03.798 --> 15:06.099
Yeah. He said you guys
really had a good thing going.

15:06.215 --> 15:07.582
Oh, we did.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.238
But you know what? It sounds like this...

15:09.282 --> 15:11.249
this restaurant back home
is an incredible opportunity.

15:11.274 --> 15:12.216
So what are you gonna do?

15:12.274 --> 15:13.626
Yeah, it's cool, I guess.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.665
[Chuckles] What do you mean, you guess?

15:16.014 --> 15:17.982
Well, I wouldn't say it's incredible.

15:18.165 --> 15:19.264
It's cute. It's fun.

15:19.338 --> 15:21.936
It's burgers and shrimp,
bare feet on the beach.

15:21.981 --> 15:23.221
But it's not like he'll be doing

15:23.246 --> 15:25.244
any of his cavendish quail anymore.

15:25.338 --> 15:27.870
Kind of sounds like a waste of
his talent then, don't you think?

15:27.978 --> 15:28.986
Maybe.

15:29.499 --> 15:32.000
But it's super low stress,
and he won't have to deal

15:32.025 --> 15:35.150
with any of this L.A. drama anymore.

15:35.175 --> 15:36.237
Oh.

15:36.616 --> 15:38.683
And he'll be home with
people who really love him.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.442
Plenty of people love him here, by the way.

15:41.353 --> 15:43.005
Not like we do.

15:43.589 --> 15:44.710
Really?

15:44.735 --> 15:48.964
Look, Joss, Harry was happy
when he was back in Australia.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.630
He had a good and comfortable life

15:50.655 --> 15:52.701
until your bitch of a sister... I'm sorry.

15:52.726 --> 15:54.620
- Okay.
- Sorry, but that's how I feel.

15:54.847 --> 15:56.898
Ripped him away from
everything that he loved

15:56.923 --> 15:58.522
to bring him here and transplant him

15:58.547 --> 16:00.198
- and dump him for someone new.
- Whoa, whoa, okay.

16:00.223 --> 16:01.638
That's not fair, Kate.

16:01.663 --> 16:04.229
He has no reason to stay in L.A. anymore.

16:05.210 --> 16:07.355
He has nothing to show for his time here

16:07.380 --> 16:09.296
except for a bunch of failed dreams.

16:09.321 --> 16:12.412
- Failed dreams?
- His words, nof mine.

16:15.172 --> 16:18.808
And I told him, "buddy,
I'm a black belt in karate.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.101
You really don't want to mess with me."

16:21.232 --> 16:22.566
And he still made a move.

16:22.591 --> 16:25.107
So I... whacked him right in the eardrums

16:25.132 --> 16:27.594
to mess up his balance,
and then I blocked his punch

16:27.619 --> 16:29.659
and gave him a quick jab to the jaw,

16:29.684 --> 16:32.052
but I finished it with an
elbow right to the temple.

16:32.077 --> 16:34.078
Bam! Out!

16:34.365 --> 16:36.112
Hey, I warned him.

16:37.467 --> 16:38.614
So...

16:39.376 --> 16:42.023
Rebecca, what happens now?

16:42.349 --> 16:45.711
She tells you to get lost
'cause she happens to be my wife.

16:45.894 --> 16:49.383
Wife? Uh, look, buddy, I-I had no idea.

16:49.537 --> 16:52.005
Babe, sorry I'm late. 405 was a nightmare.

16:52.548 --> 16:53.712
You look stunning.

16:53.737 --> 16:55.871
What are you doing here?
I was hoping to find you.

16:56.190 --> 16:57.945
So, what do you say we
go to the restaurant,

16:57.970 --> 16:59.871
we grab a bite, talk about our day?

16:59.972 --> 17:02.018
I'm sure Francois has a table for us.

17:03.213 --> 17:06.068
I'm all talked out. Let's get to bed.

17:22.512 --> 17:25.012
[Doorbell rings]

17:26.339 --> 17:28.141
[Intercom beeps] Samantha: Come on in!

17:34.711 --> 17:35.890
Hello?

17:36.554 --> 17:37.688
April?

17:37.713 --> 17:39.408
In the kitchen! In here!

17:41.186 --> 17:43.461
Walk straight, turn left!

17:46.265 --> 17:48.040
- Hi!
- Samantha: Hi!

17:48.637 --> 17:50.712
Your house is beautiful.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.187
Oh, I'm sorry you had to let yourself in.

17:53.212 --> 17:55.679
Consuela has the night off,
which is why I'm cooking.

17:56.311 --> 17:57.945
Attempting to cook.

17:57.979 --> 18:00.065
- Can I help?
- Oh, please. You're my guest.

18:00.090 --> 18:01.797
[Clears throat] Chop the peppers?

18:01.822 --> 18:02.848
[Both laugh]

18:03.578 --> 18:05.712
You look gorgeous. Oh, I should go change.

18:05.737 --> 18:07.705
No, no, no. I overdressed.

18:07.730 --> 18:09.364
Well, I thought I would go cas,

18:09.389 --> 18:10.855
since it's just you and me tonight.

18:12.267 --> 18:13.393
Just you and me?

18:13.427 --> 18:15.075
Didn't you get my text?

18:15.412 --> 18:17.380
Oh, when I got your message
Daniel wasn't coming,

18:17.405 --> 18:19.572
I sent Steve off to play poker.

18:19.597 --> 18:21.854
It's better with just
us girls anyway, right?

18:21.879 --> 18:24.046
Sure. Great.

18:36.970 --> 18:38.805
[Zipper opens]

18:42.022 --> 18:43.155
[Rumbling]

18:43.190 --> 18:45.624
Aah! Earthquake! Earthquake!

18:46.513 --> 18:47.860
Oh!

18:50.139 --> 18:51.772
[Rumbling stops]

18:51.797 --> 18:53.110
Is it over?

18:56.022 --> 18:57.735
What are the chances that we can pretend

18:57.760 --> 18:59.616
I didn't just squeal like a little girl?

19:00.024 --> 19:01.824
[Both laugh]

19:01.922 --> 19:04.398
You did whisk me into the doorway.

19:04.423 --> 19:07.056
Well, I was using you as cover, obviously.

19:07.416 --> 19:08.550
[Laughs]

19:08.575 --> 19:12.378
[Sighs] I need a drink.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.439
- You're reading my mind.
- Okay.

19:14.464 --> 19:16.332
[Laughs]

19:25.876 --> 19:27.632
[Both laugh]

19:28.784 --> 19:30.284
[Glasses clink]

19:37.332 --> 19:38.546
My God.

19:39.334 --> 19:41.769
I don't think there's any way
you could be more beautiful.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.853
I don't know what to think anymore.

19:55.878 --> 19:57.425
The whole thing is driving me crazy.

19:57.551 --> 20:00.189
I mean, my point is, I
don't know who to trust.

20:00.554 --> 20:02.855
Harry says he's doing it
because it's a childhood dream.

20:02.890 --> 20:05.358
Kate says it's because he
has absolutely nothing here,

20:05.393 --> 20:07.193
which is a bald-faced lie.

20:07.228 --> 20:08.694
God, she's so irritating.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.130
Do you realize that an earthquake

20:10.164 --> 20:11.697
has come and gone since
you've been talking?

20:11.732 --> 20:14.392
Harry could totally have the
career that I think he wants

20:14.417 --> 20:15.767
if he would just stick it out, you know.

20:15.792 --> 20:16.912
What... What am I supposed to do?

20:16.937 --> 20:18.037
Let him go back to Australia

20:18.071 --> 20:19.439
because the thing that brought him here,

20:19.473 --> 20:21.106
uh, slept with a co-worker,
got pregnant with his baby,

20:21.141 --> 20:23.499
nearly died, and then,
what, chose the other guy?

20:23.524 --> 20:25.491
Or... or am I supposed to be a real friend

20:25.516 --> 20:27.983
and say something to him
that he's lying to himself

20:28.008 --> 20:29.609
about what he's going back to and...

20:29.668 --> 20:31.909
Well, it sort of sounds
like Harry's just trying

20:31.934 --> 20:33.264
to find something that makes him happy

20:33.299 --> 20:34.791
after all the crap he's
been through, you know?

20:34.816 --> 20:37.714
Will it work? Who knows?

20:37.739 --> 20:38.985
"Who knows?"

20:39.678 --> 20:41.755
No, I-I find no comfort in "who knows?"

20:41.780 --> 20:44.142
You know, working at some
little shack on the beach.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.211
Do you think that's gonna cut
it for Harry? Probably not.

20:46.236 --> 20:47.788
He owned one of the
hottest restaurants in L.A.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.506
- for two years, right?
- Mm-hmm.

20:49.531 --> 20:50.531
He's a rock-star chef.

20:50.556 --> 20:52.706
That's not a feeling a man forgets easily.

20:53.637 --> 20:54.974
- That's true.
- Yeah.

20:57.031 --> 20:58.557
Messenger just dropped this for you.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.874
Oh. Great. Thanks.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.081
You need anything else?

21:01.106 --> 21:03.607
No. I'm good, Molly. Thank you.

21:11.454 --> 21:13.922
_

21:23.696 --> 21:25.723
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:25.748 --> 21:27.588
You ready to go? We're the last ones here.

21:27.613 --> 21:29.612
Yeah, I got another hour to wrap this up.

21:29.637 --> 21:31.960
Ooh. Okay. I'll see you later, then.

21:31.985 --> 21:33.019
Uh, your place?

21:33.112 --> 21:35.302
- No, I'll come to yours.
- Perfect.

21:37.661 --> 21:39.868
I just had a crazy déjÃ  vu.

21:39.893 --> 21:41.573
Yeah? What?

21:41.598 --> 21:45.229
Last year when we would work late nights

21:45.254 --> 21:47.423
and everything was so loaded and tense.

21:47.704 --> 21:48.851
[Both chuckle]

21:48.876 --> 21:50.510
And now look at us.

21:50.535 --> 21:52.003
We're saying "your place or mine?"

21:52.028 --> 21:53.828
Like it's the most
normal thing in the world.

21:53.853 --> 21:55.187
It's nice, isn't it?

21:55.279 --> 21:56.521
It is.

21:57.981 --> 22:01.537
But if someone would have
told me last year this time

22:01.562 --> 22:03.863
this is how things would end up,

22:03.888 --> 22:05.922
I would have laughed in their faces.

22:05.947 --> 22:07.415
So, what are you saying?

22:07.440 --> 22:09.875
I'm saying that things change.

22:10.593 --> 22:12.855
Plans change.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.348
The old me would never admit that.

22:15.373 --> 22:20.050
But if everything had gone
as I had intended it to go...

22:22.487 --> 22:25.088
I wouldn't be here with you right now.

22:25.940 --> 22:29.546
So maybe it's good to let go of plans.

22:29.838 --> 22:34.046
Just... make room for
amazing things to happen.

22:34.327 --> 22:35.486
[Chuckles]

22:36.619 --> 22:40.054
Wouldn't want to miss
out on something amazing.

22:43.158 --> 22:45.358
- See you later.
- Mm-hmm.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.406
[Laughs]
- Ahh.

22:53.431 --> 22:54.735
Please make it stop.

22:54.769 --> 22:56.903
You have to have just one.

22:56.938 --> 22:58.147
Your body can certainly stand it.

22:58.172 --> 22:59.639
Not a single ounce of fat.

22:59.664 --> 23:01.298
Oh, that is not true.

23:01.323 --> 23:02.923
[Cellphone ringing] Oh, excuse me.

23:03.092 --> 23:05.393
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to
take this. It's my mother.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.887
I would ignore it, but
she just got a neck lift.

23:07.912 --> 23:10.848
Hi, mom. How's the swelling?

23:12.365 --> 23:13.803
Oh, good.

23:17.257 --> 23:19.891
If you're gonna eat that,
you got to do it right.

23:20.293 --> 23:23.076
- Oh. Steven. Hmm.
- Hmm.

23:23.482 --> 23:25.815
Oh, I lost big tonight.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.476
Mm. Don't tell Sam, but we
don't have a Tesla anymore.

23:29.501 --> 23:30.841
[Chuckles]

23:31.621 --> 23:32.921
Here, let me do that for you

23:32.946 --> 23:36.054
the way it's, uh, supposed to be done.

23:36.201 --> 23:38.136
Thank you. That's enough.

23:39.857 --> 23:41.634
Here. A little bit. Look at that.

23:41.659 --> 23:43.359
What the hell are you doing?!

23:43.384 --> 23:44.584
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

23:44.609 --> 23:45.843
You are disgusting!

23:45.868 --> 23:47.101
April, just wait. She...

23:47.126 --> 23:48.259
Tell your wife dinner was lovely,

23:48.284 --> 23:50.585
but I am suddenly feeling sick.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.808
Oh, come...

24:06.278 --> 24:07.278
[Door closes]

24:07.313 --> 24:09.593
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

24:09.742 --> 24:11.409
Nice bed head. Did I wake you?

24:12.643 --> 24:14.946
Do we have a meeting
that I've forgotten about?

24:14.980 --> 24:17.081
No. Where's Kate?

24:17.115 --> 24:19.517
Kate is hiking, I think.

24:19.552 --> 24:22.354
Good. Great. Come here. We need to talk.

24:22.388 --> 24:24.356
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:24.390 --> 24:26.858
Come here. Pull up a seat.

24:26.892 --> 24:28.225
[Chuckles]

24:29.395 --> 24:33.020
Oh... What... what... what is this?

24:33.045 --> 24:35.680
This is your life, Harry Davis.

24:35.705 --> 24:37.822
Oh, no. Joss, I've not even had coffee yet.

24:37.847 --> 24:39.641
Ah, ah, ah. Coffee can wait.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.021
[Chuckles]

24:46.578 --> 24:50.381
Look at how adorable and excited you were.

24:50.415 --> 24:52.883
Savi said you were so nervous opening night

24:52.917 --> 24:55.218
that you puked four times
and you barely slept.

24:55.253 --> 24:56.512
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.720
[Chuckles] But then look.

24:58.745 --> 25:00.206
First night was a wild success.

25:00.231 --> 25:02.465
Look at us celebrating
with burgers and champagne.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.094
And then the next week,

25:04.128 --> 25:06.162
<i>you got a rave review in L.A. magazine.</i>

25:06.197 --> 25:09.665
And I quote, "L.A. has
a hot, new aussie chef,

25:09.700 --> 25:11.042
"and his name is Harry Davis.

25:11.067 --> 25:12.678
"His American contemporary cuisine is,

25:12.703 --> 25:15.005
in a word, intoxicating."

25:15.039 --> 25:16.378
Did you make this?

25:16.403 --> 25:18.538
No. I don't scrapbook. What? Are you crazy?

25:18.563 --> 25:21.820
[Chuckles] OCD crafting
is... is Savi's thing.

25:21.845 --> 25:24.402
She's been collecting this
stuff for years, Harry.

25:25.089 --> 25:26.557
[Scoffs]

25:26.717 --> 25:28.518
Why didn't she ever show me?

25:28.645 --> 25:30.079
Mm, you know her.

25:30.104 --> 25:31.872
Everything's always
a work-in-progress.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.733
She believed in you.

25:36.233 --> 25:37.793
I believe in you.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.310
When did you stop
believing in yourself, huh?

25:39.335 --> 25:41.404
- Okay, Joss, look...
- No, no, sit, Harry. Sit down.

25:41.429 --> 25:42.591
Just listen to me.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.700
[Inhales deeply] Maybe I didn't know you

25:45.735 --> 25:47.202
when you were the little surfer dude

25:47.237 --> 25:49.871
growing up in Australia
wanting to be like the guy

25:49.906 --> 25:52.195
who owned the crab shack on
the beach that you adored.

25:52.309 --> 25:54.503
But I know you now.

25:55.311 --> 25:56.303
I do.

25:56.396 --> 25:59.406
And I am damn sure that you've
surpassed all of those dreams.

25:59.431 --> 26:00.951
Joss, you're gonna find another chef...

26:00.976 --> 26:04.570
No, this isn't about me,
stupid. This is about you.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.588
T-t-this isn't about
our partnership.

26:06.622 --> 26:07.891
This is about the guy that you became

26:07.916 --> 26:09.183
when you were dragged here

26:09.208 --> 26:10.975
to this desperate, God-awful place.

26:11.382 --> 26:13.145
Because I'm pretty sure
that you like that guy.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.549
That guy right here...

26:14.574 --> 26:16.420
this guy is a force to be reckoned with,

26:16.445 --> 26:18.248
working a job that he loves.

26:20.235 --> 26:21.868
Hey, I just...

26:22.404 --> 26:24.530
I just wanted to make sure
you remembered that guy...

26:25.907 --> 26:27.675
Before you left him behind, huh?

26:46.894 --> 26:48.866
Well, good morning, there, sleepyhead.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.931
Oh. Hey.

26:51.966 --> 26:53.066
I made you some coffee.

26:53.634 --> 26:55.035
I thought you left.

26:55.069 --> 26:58.045
Without saying goodbye? Not a chance.

26:58.091 --> 26:59.224
Milk, one sugar?

26:59.249 --> 27:01.395
Black, but who cares?

27:02.173 --> 27:03.607
Thank you.

27:07.407 --> 27:10.075
I can't remember the last
time I woke up next to someone.

27:10.250 --> 27:12.251
Me neither.

27:14.755 --> 27:17.885
When was the last time you
woke up next to someone?

27:19.539 --> 27:21.406
You don't have to tell
me if you don't want to.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.765
No, no, I do want to.

27:23.130 --> 27:27.366
Though I'm not sure it counts
because I paid her to stay.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.435
You paid her?

27:29.469 --> 27:31.103
Well, I paid her for the night,

27:31.138 --> 27:33.939
and then I paid a little extra

27:33.973 --> 27:35.685
for her to stay until morning.

27:37.476 --> 27:39.210
I hate waking up alone.

27:41.623 --> 27:43.590
I come to this hotel a lot.

27:43.750 --> 27:46.384
I have a few drinks, hook up with someone.

27:46.419 --> 27:49.454
It's... It's a bit of a habit, really.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.570
So, how about you?

27:54.927 --> 27:56.385
He was married.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.285
But I didn't care because I was in love.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.098
And I'd never been happier.

28:03.936 --> 28:05.585
And then he died.

28:06.715 --> 28:08.205
I'm sorry.

28:08.239 --> 28:11.020
That... must have been incredibly hard.

28:11.443 --> 28:13.243
I can't help but think of his death

28:13.278 --> 28:14.912
as some sort of punishment.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.011
For what?

28:19.718 --> 28:23.287
Well, let's hope that's
not how the universe works.

28:25.223 --> 28:26.658
You can't help who you love.

28:29.026 --> 28:31.393
Damn it. I have to get to the office.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.630
I really want to see you again.

28:34.365 --> 28:35.665
Ben, you don't need to...

28:35.700 --> 28:39.970
I-I want to take you out
on a proper date, okay?

28:40.004 --> 28:41.638
I really like talking to you.

28:41.672 --> 28:43.139
Here's my number.

28:44.308 --> 28:45.808
I really hope you call me.

28:47.343 --> 28:48.777
Bye, Rebecca.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.855
[Door opens]

28:55.652 --> 28:57.015
[Door closes]

28:57.654 --> 28:58.988
[Chuckles]

29:02.758 --> 29:04.559
I am so sorry, Samantha.

29:04.594 --> 29:06.060
I know I should have told you earlier.

29:06.095 --> 29:07.895
I just... I didn't know how.

29:07.930 --> 29:10.232
I never would have had coffee
with him in the first place

29:10.266 --> 29:12.620
- had I known he was married.
- Honey, it's okay.

29:12.645 --> 29:15.246
I know you didn't know.
You don't think that way.

29:15.771 --> 29:18.572
And as for last night,
well, I knew something

29:18.607 --> 29:20.842
must have happened for you
to leave in such a hurry.

29:21.233 --> 29:23.845
You're taking this so well.

29:23.870 --> 29:25.571
It's not the first time it's happened.

29:25.781 --> 29:28.571
Oh, it doesn't mean that
you're not special or anything.

29:28.596 --> 29:30.530
I mean, God knows you're stunning.

29:30.555 --> 29:32.700
But there are a lot of
pretty moms at the school.

29:32.725 --> 29:34.660
And most of the time, they say yes.

29:35.279 --> 29:37.278
Steve can be a real charmer.

29:37.513 --> 29:39.949
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand.

29:40.489 --> 29:42.057
Oh, uh...

29:42.531 --> 29:44.731
We have an open marriage.

29:46.067 --> 29:49.203
Well, surely this isn't the
first time you've heard of one.

29:49.237 --> 29:54.007
I mean, I just never met anyone
who admits to it so openly.

29:55.504 --> 29:58.043
So you see other men?

29:58.182 --> 30:00.317
No. I don't need to do that.

30:00.342 --> 30:03.903
But if he needs another woman
every now and then, well...

30:05.137 --> 30:07.438
And Steve and I both know
that you have a boyfriend,

30:07.463 --> 30:10.098
but if you are interested...

30:10.123 --> 30:11.390
Ooh, no, please!

30:11.930 --> 30:13.806
I mean, no judgment.

30:13.831 --> 30:15.372
- It's just...
- No judgment?

30:15.397 --> 30:16.397
No!

30:16.422 --> 30:18.056
'Cause you look pretty offended.

30:18.081 --> 30:19.181
No, not offended. Just...

30:19.206 --> 30:21.607
You think you're better than me, don't you?

30:21.632 --> 30:23.433
- Of course I don't.
- With your cute, little shop

30:23.458 --> 30:24.980
and your plucky single-mom thing.

30:25.005 --> 30:26.752
I think we need to stop now.

30:26.777 --> 30:28.405
But at the end of the day, April,

30:28.430 --> 30:30.929
<i>your daughter is at my
house five nights a week.</i>

30:31.011 --> 30:32.812
<i>She wants what's in my closet.</i>

30:32.846 --> 30:35.566
<i>She looks up to my kid,
not the other way around.</i>

30:38.640 --> 30:41.520
Thank you for the latte.
Really hit the spot.

31:16.672 --> 31:18.456
We'll give you a moment.

Peyton and Chloe were
really mean to Patty today.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.864
They told every girl in the classroom

33:33.889 --> 33:35.590
to ignore her until she cried.

33:37.151 --> 33:39.098
And then they passed around a mean poem

33:39.132 --> 33:41.100

33:42.596 --> 33:44.297

33:45.146 --> 33:47.272

33:47.307 --> 33:49.875

33:58.616 --> 33:59.917
I wish you hadn't done that,

33:59.942 --> 34:03.077

when all of your friends

34:03.102 --> 34:04.903
are doing something and you want to fit in.

34:04.928 --> 34:06.595
Sometimes you do things you shouldn't.

That's because you're a good person.

But there are times in your life

34:14.299 --> 34:16.467
when you're gonna have
to make hard decisions.

34:16.502 --> 34:19.571
And figuring out who your real friends are

34:19.605 --> 34:21.406
is one of those times.

34:21.440 --> 34:25.076
But Peyton's so nice to me.
And her whole life is so...

Awesome? [Chuckles]

34:28.013 --> 34:30.648

34:30.681 --> 34:32.525
You know, when I was your age,

34:32.550 --> 34:34.985
Stacey Datnow was my Peyton.

34:35.353 --> 34:37.199
She was the coolest.

34:37.523 --> 34:40.525
I would do anything she wanted
just so she would like me,

34:40.551 --> 34:42.418
but there were times
when she just ignored me.

34:42.793 --> 34:45.011
Peyton did that to me once.

34:45.176 --> 34:46.643
Well, guess what.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.786
One of those days, I met Savi,

34:50.569 --> 34:52.786
and we clicked right away.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.674
Then I realized that
Stacey wasn't all that.

34:56.074 --> 34:59.477
And Savi and I have been
best friends ever since.

34:59.677 --> 35:01.644
So, are you saying

35:01.679 --> 35:03.380
that I shouldn't be friends with Peyton?

35:03.432 --> 35:04.685
No.

35:05.336 --> 35:09.973
All I'm saying is... You
have to choose carefully,

35:09.998 --> 35:11.865
because the friends you have now

35:11.890 --> 35:13.691
could be your friends for life.

35:13.924 --> 35:15.558
When we first started hanging out,

35:15.593 --> 35:17.326
I literally thought Peyton

35:17.360 --> 35:18.987
was the nicest person on the planet.

35:19.012 --> 35:22.462
Well, sometimes the things
that are shiny on the outside

35:22.487 --> 35:25.786
aren't so shiny and pretty on the inside.

inside and out like you.

35:56.499 --> 35:58.014

Because divorce is like a death.

your feelings for Harry.
