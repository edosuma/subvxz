Well, hello, everybody, and welcome
to the afternoon "One Dollar Movie".

00:19.290 --> 00:23.480
I'm your host, Bob Downs.
But, of course, you know that. Ha!

00:23.580 --> 00:25.980
And today we have
a cinema classic for you.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.320
"The Return of the Killer Tomatoes"

00:29.420 --> 00:31.450
Sounds like a real winner, doesn't it?

00:31.550 --> 00:34.530
Now, some lucky viewer today,
if they know the secret word,

00:34.630 --> 00:39.580
will have a chance to win
our "Pot o' Gold" jackpot

00:39.680 --> 00:42.680
which, today, is up to...

00:47.560 --> 00:51.130
...9 dollars and 22 cents.

00:51.230 --> 00:57.970
Wow! And all you have to do to win
is know our secret word when I call.

00:58.070 --> 01:02.850
It's a common household word.
One used all the time.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.620
And our secret word today is...

01:06.830 --> 01:12.340
..."the". OK now, on with "the" show.

01:14.010 --> 01:16.780
OK, let's all get comfy now.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.090
Are you comfy? Good. Roll them, Sid.

01:31.610 --> 01:34.840
# It's a big chill life
when you're out of school

01:34.940 --> 01:38.100
# You don't have to dress up
and it's OK for you to drool

01:38.200 --> 01:41.350
# Gonna jump in my woody,
gonna play my guitar

01:41.450 --> 01:43.620
# And take my socks off

01:44.750 --> 01:48.070
# Like poetry in motion
Like a perfect wave

01:48.170 --> 01:51.360
# Gonna ride with the wind
Spend the money I save

01:51.460 --> 01:54.280
# 'Cause summer's here
and I got nothing to do

01:54.380 --> 01:56.470
# But get my rocks off

01:57.380 --> 02:03.540
# When those big-breasted girls
go to the beach #

02:03.640 --> 02:05.330
'Hey, Sid, is this the right flick?

02:05.430 --> 02:07.500
'We're supposed to be
showing something called

02:07.600 --> 02:10.000
"'Return of the Killer Tomatoes".'

02:10.100 --> 02:11.960
'Yeah, but I like this one better.'

02:12.060 --> 02:13.630
'Yeah, me too.

02:13.730 --> 02:16.430
'But we showed it three times last week.'

02:16.530 --> 02:18.100
'OK.'

02:55.940 --> 02:57.560

03:48.450 --> 03:50.530
Quarter!

03:52.120 --> 03:53.200
Quarter.

04:34.290 --> 04:39.970
Success! This time we shall not fail!

04:56.100 --> 05:00.196
# Return of the killer tomatoes

05:03.009 --> 05:07.197
# Return of the killer tomatoes

05:10.370 --> 05:13.940
# The theme song still remains the same
The plot itself has hardly changed

05:14.040 --> 05:17.360
# A guaranteed bet for fortune and fame!

05:17.460 --> 05:19.380
# Tomatoes! Tomatoes!

05:29.470 --> 05:33.060
# Remember Herman Farbage

05:36.390 --> 05:40.350
# Who was taking out the garbage

05:43.690 --> 05:45.470
# It seems he wasn't killed at all

05:45.570 --> 05:47.180
# He fought tomatoes to a stall

05:47.280 --> 05:49.700
# His TV show premieres this fall

05:49.870 --> 05:52.160
# Tomatoes! Tomatoes! Tomatoes!

06:02.800 --> 06:06.640
# We have no mighty shoguns

06:09.800 --> 06:13.300
# No flying spaceships or explosions

06:17.060 --> 06:20.550
# No James Bond cars or Top Gun jets
Or real expensive fancy sets

06:20.650 --> 06:23.050
# But a deal we've cut for vid-cassettes

06:23.150 --> 06:26.820
# Oh, we made an offer he couldn't refuse.

06:43.130 --> 06:47.050
# Sit back as now the show starts

06:50.130 --> 06:54.050
# Part two of only two parts

06:57.470 --> 07:01.130
# But if this film does well, you see
We're sure you know predictably

07:01.230 --> 07:05.150
# It won't be long until part three #

07:40.230 --> 07:43.110
Hi, Tara, I brought your pizza.

07:44.610 --> 07:52.320
One pepperoni, extra cheese
and boysenberry sauce.

07:55.370 --> 07:58.960
Well... enjoy.

08:07.790 --> 08:14.540
Say, what do you and the professor
do up here, if you don't mind me asking.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.870
The professor continues his research
in gene-splicing,

08:17.970 --> 08:19.670
just as he did at the university.

08:21.480 --> 08:25.170
So, do you ever come to town?
I never see you. Or him.

08:25.270 --> 08:27.690
But especially, I never see you.

08:28.900 --> 08:35.140
You know. Well, um, so, I guess then,
you are doing research too.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.200
Are you his daughter? Or what?

08:39.409 --> 08:42.120
I'm his lover. I also cook and clean.

08:51.300 --> 08:55.550
They are gardeners and carpenters.
They are not tomato-men.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.640
OK, well, um...

09:02.020 --> 09:06.960
...just remember, Finletters,
for all your pizza needs.

smuggling is at its highest level

the years since the Great Tomato War,

of the potential danger involved.

'It is a danger I remember well...'

09:46.350 --> 09:48.090
Turn the damn channel, will you?

09:48.190 --> 09:50.510
There's got to be
something better than this.

09:50.610 --> 09:53.780
- Want me to change the channel?
- Yeah.

We let them sneak in now and,
who knows what it'll lead to.

10:45.910 --> 10:49.610
- Not again.
- Back so soon? Strike out already?

10:49.710 --> 10:52.400
I can barely get anything out of her
besides her name.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.210
Would you believe
that she's old Gangreen's girlfriend?

10:55.340 --> 10:57.700
That old looney tune's got a girlfriend?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.830
What? Chad, you got a girlfriend?

10:59.930 --> 11:02.700
No, not me, Uncle Wilbur.
Gangreen, that nut on the hill.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.970
Oh, Gangreen. Bad apple.
Never did trust that fella.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.670
You know, a lot of people thought
he must have had more to do

11:10.770 --> 11:13.840
with the Great Tomato uprising
that never came out.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.670
Nothing ever proven though.

11:15.770 --> 11:19.400
But that was a long time ago, boys.
Things were different then.

11:19.700 --> 11:22.220
Tomatoes were legal.
You could find them everywhere.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.930
Hey, Chad, there he goes again.

11:24.030 --> 11:26.600
Sometimes I sure miss
pizza with tomato sauce.

11:26.700 --> 11:30.310
All right, one medium coconut
with anchovies and strawberry jam.

11:30.410 --> 11:32.860
Right here. On you.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.190
I remember that first day
they moved into the fields.

11:36.290 --> 11:40.320
Nobody really took it seriously then,
but before long they were in the suburbs,

11:40.420 --> 11:42.830
then into the inner-cities.

11:42.930 --> 11:47.120
Television stations began to cover,
the media made a big deal.

11:47.220 --> 11:50.540
At first people ignored it,
then they got scared.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.290
You should have seen it.

11:52.390 --> 11:54.550
But some of us were there.
We held the line.

of old scenes together to save money.

- 'Wrong number.'

Who would have thought
that one horrible song

14:15.620 --> 14:19.780
would shrink those giant tomatoes
I worked so hard to create.

This time, music will be our victory.
Not our defeat.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

14:32.180 --> 14:33.580
Idiot!

what it is to love or be loved.

Emotions are for people, not vegetables.

Sir, it is my pleasure to respond
to your immediate needs.

- I'd just like to say that I...
- Listen to me, pretty boy.

14:59.080 --> 15:03.240
I know you're hanging around until
something opens up in the TV news field.

15:03.340 --> 15:07.910
But it just does not look right
for a noted misanthrope of my stature

15:08.010 --> 15:10.490
to have a servant who looks like you.

15:10.590 --> 15:12.620
I'm sorry, sir, I mean, master.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.370
I realise I'm somewhat
of a disappointment to you.

15:15.470 --> 15:17.760
How's this?

15:18.100 --> 15:20.230
Oh, come on.

Igor!

15:37.040 --> 15:39.170
Oh, cut that out!

15:46.340 --> 15:49.950
Mutant! No telling how it could affect
the transformation process.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.220
- Get rid of it.
- OK.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.960
So long, sponge-face.

16:06.980 --> 16:09.180
Oh, he is so sexy.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.990
- Can you believe it?
- I know.

16:13.150 --> 16:16.350
Can you prove to me that you're 18?

16:16.450 --> 16:19.250
No, I don't want you... Thank you.

16:22.910 --> 16:25.980
- I had a heck of a time finding you here.
- I told you I'd be at the shoe store.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.860
OK, ladies, now what we need is your name,

16:28.960 --> 16:31.700
your phone number,
your address and a picture.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.620
Please, do not forget the picture.
Thank you.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.410
What the hell are you doing?

16:36.510 --> 16:39.160
- You want to blow my science project?
- What science project?

16:39.260 --> 16:41.880
Running a scam contest?

16:46.270 --> 16:49.550
What are these girls gonna do
when they find out there's no winner?

16:49.650 --> 16:52.510
Oh, no problem. You see,
I graciously invite them out to dinner

16:52.610 --> 16:55.510
and then I present them
with the second place price.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.270
- It's me.
- Spare me. I give up.

16:57.370 --> 16:59.680
Listen, Uncle Wilbur
wants us to work tonight.

16:59.780 --> 17:02.350
Yeah... er, no,
can't do it tonight. Listen!

17:02.450 --> 17:05.270
See that's Nancy over there,
and she's looking to bribe the judge.

17:05.369 --> 17:06.980
- You?
- Yeah, that's me.

17:07.079 --> 17:10.240
- I figured. Thanks a lot, pal.
- You think your buddy, your pal,

17:10.339 --> 17:11.950
- your roommate here...
- Schmuck.

17:12.050 --> 17:14.410
- Think I'll leave you out in the cold?
- Yes.

17:14.510 --> 17:19.369
No, all right. Well, how about, see
those over there? That's Tiffany.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.079
- Room for another judge.
- No thanks.

17:21.180 --> 17:25.260
- If I want a girl I don't need your help.
- OK. All right, suit yourself.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.340
Ladies, did I mention
the Playboy centrefold opportunity?

18:04.310 --> 18:07.420
Don't worry, little brother,
I'll protect you.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.610
I don't mind that you're a fuzzy tomato.

18:10.480 --> 18:17.780
Fuzzy tomato. FT.
That will be your name. FT.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.750
Chad Finletter, Zen master
of the fine art of pizza building,

18:45.850 --> 18:48.790
will attempt the ultimate pizza.

18:48.890 --> 18:53.020
He calls upon the muses
for inspiration. And begins...

18:53.940 --> 18:56.990
Anchovies, yes. Of course.

18:57.570 --> 19:01.410
Raisinettes. Gummy bears, why not.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.270
Kiwi.

19:04.370 --> 19:09.520
They laughed at me in Vienna,
but now, the final master stroke...

19:09.620 --> 19:11.410
...a dab of peanut butter.

19:13.460 --> 19:16.510
I wonder what these things
tasted like with tomato sauce?

19:17.670 --> 19:21.980
Ah! Of course, marshmellows.

19:27.310 --> 19:29.540
I was just fooling...

19:29.640 --> 19:31.600
You surprised me.

19:32.650 --> 19:36.150
- Do you want to make love?
- Do I want to?

19:38.860 --> 19:42.410
Just a minute. I'm a little thirsty.

19:51.330 --> 19:53.740
- What did you say?
- Do you want to make love?

19:55.080 --> 19:57.660
Maybe you'd better sit down.

19:59.630 --> 20:03.910
Here, just have a seat.
You look a little tired?

20:04.010 --> 20:08.830
- Would you rather I cleaned up?
- No, that's fine. I'll do that later.

20:08.930 --> 20:12.710
- You see, I work here.
- You wish sex now?

20:12.810 --> 20:17.070
Yes... No. Let me get you a towel.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.517
Quiet, FT.

20:27.450 --> 20:32.120
Here we go. Before you get a chill.
I'll let you do that.

20:33.040 --> 20:36.780
So... did you maybe fall down...

20:36.880 --> 20:39.860
...and bump your head, hard?

20:39.960 --> 20:44.530
You know, maybe did your mother drop
you when you were a baby?

20:44.630 --> 20:47.750
- You speak much English?
- I speak perfect English.

20:47.850 --> 20:50.830
I also cook 815 international dishes,

20:50.930 --> 20:55.420
perform 637 sexual acts,
and use all the popular home appliances.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.010
- Shall I cook you something?
- No, thank you.

20:59.110 --> 21:00.930
How about a blow job.
Maybe iron your pants?

21:01.030 --> 21:02.950
No!

21:04.990 --> 21:06.930
Let's talk about something else.

21:07.030 --> 21:10.140
The weather. How's the weather?

21:11.240 --> 21:14.070
Wet, I guess.

21:14.960 --> 21:21.010
Rain and all that. Not exactly
a primo night for a stroll.

21:21.750 --> 21:24.870
You know what I mean? So why are you here?

21:24.970 --> 21:28.470
I ran away. You're the only person
I know, so I came here.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.290
Ran away? Why, did he hurt you?

21:31.390 --> 21:33.520
Tired. Cold.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.050
Is this your place of dwelling?

21:37.150 --> 21:39.980
Dwelling? You mean, house?

21:40.730 --> 21:44.640
Here? No, I don't live here.
It's a pizza place.

21:44.740 --> 21:46.890
I have an apartment.

21:46.990 --> 21:50.370
Good. Then we'll go there. Take me.

21:51.620 --> 21:55.250
Take me... Yes.

21:59.540 --> 22:03.000
You're very assertive, you know.
But I like that.

22:06.130 --> 22:08.830
I don't know how I'm going
to explain this to Matt.

22:08.930 --> 22:13.120
# Oh Susannah, well, don't you cry for me

22:13.220 --> 22:17.010
# 'Cause I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee

22:17.890 --> 22:21.420
# I do not know the rest
of the words to the song

22:21.520 --> 22:23.970
# I think I'll make them up

22:24.070 --> 22:27.780
# I'm going to my place
and wake my best friend up #

22:28.820 --> 22:31.480
Buddy, I'm home.

22:33.410 --> 22:35.810
Chad, buddy,
you should have seen me last night.

22:35.910 --> 22:37.560
I was incredible.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.610
I've got to tell you.
This girl, she's nice and everything,

22:40.710 --> 22:42.940
but kind of a weird duck, you know.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.280
She's studying to be a flight attendant.
I mean, come on,

22:46.380 --> 22:49.380
it's like studying to be a meter maid.
You just are.

22:51.590 --> 22:53.590
Towel, please.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.890
Chad!

23:04.230 --> 23:09.310
Buddy, listen, now talk fast, because
I know that's not your mother out there.

23:11.990 --> 23:17.940
Never put bananas and raisinettes
on the same pizza.

23:20.920 --> 23:25.950
You would not believe
the weird dream I had last night.

23:26.050 --> 23:28.950
If it's got anything to do
with the babe in the bathroom,

23:29.050 --> 23:31.990
who's going into the kitchen
right now, I haven't the slightest...

23:32.090 --> 23:34.340
What, she's real? She's here?

23:38.470 --> 23:41.040
- Who is she?
- Don't ask me. I ate right last night.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.670
- What do I do?
- That depends on what you've done.

23:43.770 --> 23:46.760
- So think. What happened last night?
- I went to the pizza place.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.140
I made a pizza. It started to rain.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.220
Tara showed up and wanted to make love...

23:51.320 --> 23:53.810
- The girl from the professor's, right?
- That's her?

23:53.910 --> 23:56.140
That's Tara? That's great! That's...

23:56.240 --> 23:59.230
You see what's happening?
Part of me is rubbing off on you.

23:59.330 --> 24:03.230
- Introduce me to your girlfriend.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

24:03.330 --> 24:06.740
You can't pretend that she doesn't exist.
You should have thought of that before.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.450
It's the hazards of the trade.

24:08.550 --> 24:10.780
You never go home
with someone in the dark,

24:10.880 --> 24:13.030
that you don't want to see in the light.

24:13.130 --> 24:15.700
It's OK, because she looks good.
She looks very good. Yes.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.330
No, that's not what I mean.
There's something strange about her.

24:19.430 --> 24:24.600
- She doesn't seem quite all there.
- I saw nothing missing.

24:28.230 --> 24:33.220
Hi. I'm Matt Stevens. I'm pleased
to make your acquaintance, Miss Tara.

24:33.320 --> 24:37.180
Greetings, Matt Stevens.
Shall I cook you breakfast?

24:37.280 --> 24:40.320
Breakfast, that would be great.

24:42.370 --> 24:44.940
- Good morning.
- Greetings, Chad.

24:45.040 --> 24:49.150
- Would you like breakfast, as well?
- Sure.

24:49.250 --> 24:52.330
Did you enjoy the sex?

24:54.130 --> 24:56.740
- Sure.
- It was my pleasure.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.960
I wish to know more
about your pizza business.

24:59.060 --> 25:02.500
Using extensive marketing surveys
and cost ratio analysis

25:02.600 --> 25:05.420
it is possible to significantly
improve the productivity

25:05.520 --> 25:10.010
and therefore increase the profit margin.
Shall we discuss this at breakfast?

25:10.110 --> 25:11.470
- Sure.
- Good.

25:11.570 --> 25:15.740
Then I'll cook toast, eggs,
bacon, toast, waffles and toast.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.530
Hey, swell.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.860
See what I mean?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.780
I see a beautiful woman
making us breakfast.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.070
- We should be this lucky every day.
- Yeah, but I...

25:32.170 --> 25:38.240
Chad... she's sexy, she's smart,
she cooks, she cleans.

25:38.340 --> 25:41.580
- I think you found the perfect woman.
- Yeah?

25:41.680 --> 25:45.590
- So why don't you get dressed.
- OK.

25:59.370 --> 26:01.580
Shh, quiet!

26:10.430 --> 26:12.530
Oh, FT!

26:12.630 --> 26:14.510
Oh, no.

26:23.510 --> 26:26.830
I'm telling you,
she's a real cloud jockey.

26:26.930 --> 26:28.930
If I were you I'd...

26:29.440 --> 26:31.880
Laughing? Let me show you something.

26:31.980 --> 26:33.180
OK.

26:42.030 --> 26:44.150
So she's a little organic.

26:54.750 --> 26:58.410
Tara! Where is that woman?

26:58.510 --> 27:00.651
Tara!

27:05.170 --> 27:06.790
Tara!

27:08.810 --> 27:10.920
Igor!

27:11.020 --> 27:13.050
The crash left a grisly carnage of bodies

27:13.150 --> 27:17.800
strewn throughout the neighbourhood,
hanging in trees, blood dripping.

27:17.900 --> 27:19.720
Sir, do you recognise any of the victims?

27:19.820 --> 27:22.330
- Mummy.
- Tough break, kid.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.140
- Stop clowning around.
- Sorry, sir, we were just practising.

27:26.240 --> 27:32.530
Tara is missing. I have worked
for days, weeks, months, years,

27:32.630 --> 27:36.200
minutes, seconds,
to create the perfect woman.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.970
I cannot afford to have my work fall
into the wrong hands.

27:40.090 --> 27:44.170
Nobody cooks toast like that girl.
Go! Find her.

27:44.350 --> 27:47.670
Missing. Is this from a reliable source?

27:47.770 --> 27:51.540
Of course it's from a reliable source.
You blonde-headed boob.

27:51.640 --> 27:55.630
- Now, go, get the truck.
- You mean the KIGR news van?

27:55.730 --> 27:58.810
- I don't care what you call it. Go!
- No problem.

28:00.190 --> 28:02.430
And don't forget
my regular pickup of formula.

28:02.530 --> 28:04.310
I need it for my experiments.

28:04.410 --> 28:07.580
Experiments will continue.
Formula at 11:00.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.880
Will you be my friend?

28:20.720 --> 28:22.800
# Call the police

28:25.180 --> 28:28.140
# Call the FBI

28:30.520 --> 28:32.980
# Your love has disappeared

28:35.230 --> 28:40.150
# And I don't know why
I can't feel it in your kiss

28:42.650 --> 28:46.110
# I can't see it in your eyes

28:47.780 --> 28:50.320
# I just got to know the truth

28:52.710 --> 28:56.880
# So don't tell me any lies

28:57.790 --> 28:59.860
# Who did it?

28:59.960 --> 29:01.420
# Who did it? #

29:02.130 --> 29:04.250
- Business?
- Regular trash pickup.

29:04.970 --> 29:05.580
OK.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.790
# It's a crime in the first degree

29:07.890 --> 29:12.690
# Who did it?

29:13.350 --> 29:15.480
# Got to solve the mystery

29:15.850 --> 29:18.510
# Got to know who could it be

29:18.610 --> 29:20.150
# Who did it? #

29:47.010 --> 29:48.910
Ah!

29:49.010 --> 29:51.660
Aargh!

29:51.760 --> 29:53.930
Show a little respect.

29:55.770 --> 29:57.380
Is everything set?

29:57.480 --> 30:01.800
The teleprompter's cued
and the cameras are white balanced.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.220
What?

30:04.320 --> 30:06.720
The teleprompter's cued
and the cameras are white balanced.

30:06.820 --> 30:09.470
I know what you said. What do you mean?

30:09.570 --> 30:13.350
'The Poindexter party
to the first tee, please.

30:13.450 --> 30:15.940
'Poindexter to the first tee.'

30:16.040 --> 30:20.190
What I mean is, we'll be here
Thursday night as planned.

30:20.290 --> 30:22.150
Thursday?

30:22.250 --> 30:23.360
Thursday.

30:23.460 --> 30:26.490
Perfect! Ha-ha!

30:26.590 --> 30:28.720
They'll never stop us this time.

30:33.430 --> 30:35.480
This is domestic.

30:43.110 --> 30:45.280
# Here we are

30:47.610 --> 30:52.070
# The two of us together all alone

30:54.740 --> 31:02.740
# It doesn't matter
whether you and I were meant to be

31:03.920 --> 31:06.470
# Just we two

31:08.840 --> 31:11.580
# We come from different worlds

31:11.680 --> 31:21.270
# And yet our love has grown,
a love that the world has yet to taste

31:23.400 --> 31:30.530
# Boy, am I glad you're not tomato paste

31:31.660 --> 31:35.120
# So touch me there

31:37.240 --> 31:42.280
# You know I like it
when you touch me there

31:45.790 --> 31:51.950
# Who would ever think that
in this big crazy world

31:52.050 --> 31:56.760
# You'd ever fall in love with me

32:01.270 --> 32:04.360
# Tenderly

32:06.440 --> 32:10.490
# Like a child without a care

32:13.860 --> 32:16.860
# Touch me there #

32:21.080 --> 32:23.070
- Wait, where are we going?
- I don't know.

32:23.170 --> 32:26.650
- I had to get you out of there.
- But why? Sex is good. Sex is normal.

32:26.750 --> 32:30.570
- But whips and handcuffs are kinky.
- Kinky? What's kinky?

32:30.670 --> 32:32.830
That's kinky. Did you see that thing...?

32:32.930 --> 32:36.810
- Look, a store!
- Oh, please, no more toasters...

32:40.310 --> 32:42.710
Slow down.

32:42.810 --> 32:46.550
I noticed your house plants
seemed a bit undernourished.

32:46.650 --> 32:49.300
- Oh, these are yummy.
- Yummy?

32:49.400 --> 32:51.140
For plants.

32:51.240 --> 32:54.180
Wait, hold on.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.970
...check this new stuff out.

32:57.070 --> 32:59.860
It's better than last week's stuff
you showed me?

33:00.870 --> 33:04.520
This is the best. Revolutionary.

33:04.620 --> 33:06.930
Are you sure this is the good stuff?

33:08.090 --> 33:09.650
Trust me.

33:09.750 --> 33:13.870
Don't give me
no "Joe Carcione" routine here.

33:13.970 --> 33:19.140
This is some of the finest. Acapulco red.

33:20.220 --> 33:22.220
Check it out.

33:27.020 --> 33:28.930
Allow me.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.830
OK, I'll take it.

33:39.530 --> 33:43.490
Hey, pleasure doing business with you.

33:54.050 --> 33:57.080
Tomatoes! Did you see that?
That guy's a smuggler!

33:57.180 --> 34:00.000
We've got to call the police
or the FBI or somebody.

34:00.100 --> 34:03.040
- Over a few tomatoes?
- They're illegal.

34:03.140 --> 34:04.960
If this keeps up
we'll all be up to our necks...

34:05.060 --> 34:06.590
- Valerian root powder.
- What?

34:06.690 --> 34:09.170
Valerian root powder.

34:09.270 --> 34:12.760
War stories. What do you
really know about tomatoes anyway?

34:12.860 --> 34:15.639
How would you feel
if you'd been raised to be eaten?

34:15.739 --> 34:17.850
Wouldn't you rebel
at the first opportunity?

34:17.949 --> 34:19.429
What are you talking about?

34:19.530 --> 34:22.780
Honey, you can't possibly
be defending those monsters.

34:22.949 --> 34:25.860
They nearly destroyed my uncle
and everything else in this country.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.880
No way I'm gonna defend tomatoes.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.300
Cheap talk from a carnivore.

34:51.650 --> 34:53.820
Let go!

34:59.530 --> 35:03.060
Look, I'm sorry I spouted off at you.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.230
I guess Uncle Wilbur
has been getting to me.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.900
You've got to reject
the older generation thinking, Chad.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.400
New ideas for a new generation.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.780
You can't keep fighting the wars
over and over for them.

35:13.880 --> 35:18.410
Welcome to Le Restaurant,
the finest in nouvelle California cuisine.

35:18.510 --> 35:21.910
We offer three specials today
for your dining enjoyment.

35:22.010 --> 35:26.420
First, baby peas
in a piquant white wine sauce.

35:26.520 --> 35:30.090
We also feature a broiled oyster
in a bed of wild oats.

35:30.190 --> 35:35.990
Thirdly, a succulent cut of the finest
organically mountain-grown turnips

35:36.280 --> 35:38.180
with fresh sprigs of parsley,

35:38.280 --> 35:41.990
delicately seasoned
with sea salt and bean sprouts.

35:42.160 --> 35:46.060
Fine. Two turnips.

35:46.160 --> 35:49.480
Don't you have any red meat?
I don't eat vegetables.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.770
How about a chili dog?

35:51.870 --> 35:54.400
- Fine.
- Very good, ma'am.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.650
May I suggest something
from the bar while you're waiting.

35:57.750 --> 36:01.740
I recommend the diet celery juice cooler.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.670
Whatever. Great.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.830
Think about what I said, Chad.

36:09.930 --> 36:14.130
Don't let someone else
tell you what to fear, or what to feel.

36:14.230 --> 36:19.910
Look, there's not a person in here
who would have acted any differently.

36:20.650 --> 36:26.850
Tomatoes are evil. A good tomato
is a squashed tomato.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.540
Period.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.250
Great. Beautiful.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.570
What is with you?

36:56.230 --> 36:57.280
No!

36:59.280 --> 37:00.840
A tomato!

37:00.940 --> 37:03.074
A tomato!

37:43.740 --> 37:46.010
What's going on?

37:46.110 --> 37:48.530
- Fire drill?
- Oh.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.000
Well, come on, let's go.

38:06.630 --> 38:09.580
She was screaming
something about tomatoes.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.390
Yeah?

38:12.180 --> 38:13.810
The red convertible.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.170
The garbage truck.

38:17.270 --> 38:20.880
Mrs Williams, please be calm.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

38:20.980 --> 38:23.550
OK, let's go ahead
and turn on the light there, Jerry.

38:23.650 --> 38:26.800
Ma'am, this will just take a second.
Here we go. Are you ready?

38:26.900 --> 38:30.430
Please bear with us.
In three, two... and one.

38:30.530 --> 38:33.350
Ma'am, just calm down
and tell us what you saw in there?

38:33.450 --> 38:37.270
Well, I was eating dinner.
It was terrible.

38:37.370 --> 38:41.070
Let's save the restaurant review, lady,
just tell us about the tomato.

38:41.170 --> 38:43.360
I was sitting there by myself and this...

38:43.460 --> 38:46.070
Wait, wait a minute. You were alone?

38:46.170 --> 38:48.030
- What? Yes.
- What's the matter?

38:48.130 --> 38:51.080
You couldn't get a date?
What about your husband?

38:51.180 --> 38:54.160
- He... He's dead.
- What was it, suicide maybe?

38:54.260 --> 38:56.580
No, he was killed in the Great Tomato War!

38:56.680 --> 38:58.290
Ma'am, that's ancient history.

38:58.390 --> 39:00.210
You should have found somebody by now.

39:00.310 --> 39:03.630
- I can't see what this had to do with...
- You can't see your feet.

39:03.730 --> 39:05.720
Do the words "fat cow"
mean anything to you?

39:05.820 --> 39:07.600
Get away from me! Get away.

39:07.700 --> 39:11.680
This woman is obviously too distraught
to talk to our television camera.

39:11.780 --> 39:14.240
I will attempt to find someone else.

39:14.410 --> 39:17.690
Hey, you with the big nose.
That's right, you?

39:17.790 --> 39:21.400
How would you like to be on television
with Charles White?

39:21.500 --> 39:24.710
Someday that'll be me.

39:27.710 --> 39:29.750
Have a nice evening.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.790
That's not mine!

39:49.280 --> 39:53.020
Hey, lady, has there been
a chase scene in this movie yet?

39:53.120 --> 39:56.600
No. And it's already 25 minutes old.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.200
Good.

40:05.630 --> 40:08.700
Well, that's the shortest chase
I've ever seen.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.550
Low budget movie.

40:12.130 --> 40:15.700
'It's 7:45 and time
for this morning's farm report,

40:15.800 --> 40:17.870
'brought to you by Kimco.

40:17.970 --> 40:21.760
'Remember, it's Kimco
for all your agricultural needs.

40:21.980 --> 40:27.130
'First, a quick look
at the commodities' board shows...'

40:27.230 --> 40:29.340
What did you want to talk to me about?

40:29.440 --> 40:31.430
Listen, buddy, it's about your girlfriend.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.260
It's cool that she's staying here
and all that, but...

40:34.360 --> 40:35.810
But what?

40:35.910 --> 40:39.140
You see... Give me that! You see that?

40:39.240 --> 40:42.020
That's a 2,000 dollar stereo system.
She won't let me use it.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.190
She hates music.
She hates all kinds of music.

40:44.290 --> 40:47.610
She hates Mozart and Sinatra
and The Grateful Dead.

40:47.710 --> 40:49.780
Now come on, who hates The Grateful Dead?

40:49.880 --> 40:51.660
She loves the farm report.

40:51.760 --> 40:55.790
She tapes the farm report.
She plays it again and again and again.

40:55.890 --> 40:58.100
OK, I'll talk to her.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.830
'...hailstorms being the major culprit.

41:00.930 --> 41:04.880
'Coupled with reports that the Soviet
crop looks unusually good this year...'

41:04.980 --> 41:07.710
635 sexual positions?

41:07.810 --> 41:09.600
That's what she says anyway.

41:09.820 --> 41:12.930
Well, it's definitely
a learning experience.

41:13.030 --> 41:16.100
Last night she brought in...
a lawn chair...

41:16.200 --> 41:19.430
six milk bottles, a tuning fork, and...

41:19.530 --> 41:21.150
FT!

41:23.500 --> 41:26.440
'Dr Heinrich Gerhard
contends that California is ideal

41:26.540 --> 41:28.120
'for all kinds of nuts and fruits.'

41:28.750 --> 41:32.040
FT! FT!

41:33.220 --> 41:34.840
Wait!

42:42.580 --> 42:44.710
Tomato!

42:46.450 --> 42:48.660
Tomato! Kill it!

43:04.720 --> 43:08.250
- Tomato lover!
- Get those tomato lovers!

43:08.350 --> 43:12.920
Stripteasers, topless dancers,
nude beaches, women taking showers.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.630
Good or bad?

43:14.730 --> 43:17.430
We begin a 15-part investigative report

43:17.530 --> 43:19.970
starting next Monday here on Channel 6.

43:20.070 --> 43:22.480
And let me tell you, the store...

43:23.950 --> 43:26.440
What the heck?
Let's get some shots of this.

43:46.100 --> 43:50.340
Hey, wait up! Where are they?

43:50.440 --> 43:52.300
- Who cares.
- I care. What is that?

43:52.400 --> 43:54.010
- FT.
- FT? What's that?

43:54.110 --> 43:57.820
- It's red. It's a gerbil.
- It's not a gerbil.

44:09.370 --> 44:13.490
The eyes! Eyes!

44:14.210 --> 44:16.590
Why can't I get the eyes right?

44:18.130 --> 44:23.120
Every time the ears are perfect.
The mouth perfect.

44:23.220 --> 44:25.080
The eyes are never right!

44:25.180 --> 44:26.790
- Professor Gangreen...
- What?

44:26.890 --> 44:29.370
Sorry to interrupt, sir, but I found Tara.

44:29.470 --> 44:31.290
What? Are you sure it was she?

44:31.390 --> 44:34.960
Yes, sir. Corner of Fifth and Evergreen.
I was there live at the scene.

44:35.060 --> 44:37.470
You know, if I had my own mini-cam,
I could really...

44:37.570 --> 44:41.260
Shut up! Follow her.
Find out where she's living.

44:41.360 --> 44:45.640
We must get her back.
We cannot afford to attract attention.

44:45.740 --> 44:47.500
Be discreet.

44:48.700 --> 44:51.360
So let it be written. So let it be done.

44:53.870 --> 44:58.200
I wonder if I can remember
how to do those brain transplants.

44:59.050 --> 45:01.030
Wait, are you nuts? That's a tomato!

45:01.130 --> 45:04.030
He's not a tomato.
It's just a fuzzy little dog.

45:04.130 --> 45:07.580
Dog? That's no dog!
What dog has red fur and only two legs?

45:07.680 --> 45:10.170
Well, what tomato
has red fur and any legs at all?

45:10.270 --> 45:15.300
Cut it! Cut it! Save the film,
strike the broads, kill the babies!

45:15.400 --> 45:20.130
My friends, I am sorry, but it looks like
we are out of money for this picture.

45:20.880 --> 45:25.010
If we don't raise some bucks fast
this film is history. I'm sorry about that.

45:25.110 --> 45:28.020
I turned down a pilot for this.
Isn't there something we can do?

45:28.120 --> 45:30.100
Don't talk to me, ask the genius producer.

45:30.200 --> 45:32.810
He's probably in Tahiti by now.

45:32.910 --> 45:34.980
Can't we raise money,
cut corners somewhere?

45:35.080 --> 45:38.490
Cut corners? Have you been
watching the last two weeks?

45:38.590 --> 45:42.820
I've got five actors playing ten parts.
Heck, I'm playing three parts myself.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.790
Have you seen these special effects.
Show him the special effects.

45:46.930 --> 45:53.170
Gentlemen, ladies... we've been
avoiding it, but it's the '80s.

45:53.270 --> 45:55.840
I think it's time...
for product placement.

45:55.940 --> 45:59.840
Give me that beer.
This generic stuff, you know, generic?

45:59.940 --> 46:01.680
It's not going to cut it.

46:01.780 --> 46:04.970
I say product placement. It'll work.
I think you should trust me on this.

46:05.070 --> 46:08.260
- Hey, that's a great idea, J.D.
- Brand names.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.730
- Product...
- Product placement.

46:10.830 --> 46:14.480
All right, look,
trust don't pay the Actors Guild.

46:14.580 --> 46:17.130
- I don't have a choice right now.
- Who cares about the Actors Guild?

46:17.250 --> 46:20.530
Folks, we're going to make the movie.
We're going back into it.

46:20.630 --> 46:23.320
We're going to see what we can do.
Product placement.

46:23.420 --> 46:26.830
- Move back behind the camera.
- Hold it! Hold it!

46:26.930 --> 46:31.870
- Who are you?
- I am from the Screen Actors Guild.

46:31.970 --> 46:37.250
And according to Section 7.3,
sub-paragraph 4, line 5,

46:37.350 --> 46:39.880
anybody who speaks on film gets paid.

46:39.980 --> 46:43.550
- He just spoke on film, so 400 dollars.
- He's not in the movie.

46:43.650 --> 46:46.850
- I did not tell him to be in the movie.
- It doesn't matter. He spoke on film.

46:46.950 --> 46:50.930
- I'm speaking on film. I get paid.
- No, no, no.

46:51.030 --> 46:54.850
- No, no, no.
- Anybody else talks, 400 dollars.

46:54.950 --> 46:57.610
Nobody else say a word!

46:57.710 --> 46:59.540
OK.

47:00.710 --> 47:02.320
Roll 'em.

47:02.420 --> 47:07.320
And "Return of the Killer Tomatoes",
Scene 32, dash 1, take 5. Marker.

47:07.420 --> 47:09.740
And, action.

47:09.840 --> 47:11.410
- How are you doing?
- Just fine.

47:11.510 --> 47:13.500
- What can I get for you.
- I'm kind of thirsty.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.580
I wonder
if you got something I could drink.

47:15.680 --> 47:19.790
Tell you what. When I'm thirsty.
I go out and get myself a Pepsi Cola.

47:19.890 --> 47:21.460
- Wow!
- A Pepsi Cola!

47:21.560 --> 47:23.590
It's the choice of a new generation.

47:23.690 --> 47:26.050
Groovy. But I'm a little hungry, too.

47:26.150 --> 47:29.220
Kind of hungry, I'll tell you.
Well, when I get a little hungry,

47:29.320 --> 47:33.600
I go out, I pick myself up
a Nestlé's Crunch Bar.

47:33.700 --> 47:35.890
Yes, it scrunches when it crunches.

47:35.990 --> 47:38.980
I'd heard that. But I'm also dry.

47:39.080 --> 47:40.980
- You're dry?
- Yeah. Parched?

47:41.080 --> 47:42.900
- You need a beer?
- I could use a beer.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.740
- How about a Moosehead?
- A Moosehead.

47:45.840 --> 47:47.240
- Moosehead.
- From the North.

47:47.340 --> 47:50.330
From the North. Or a Foster's.

47:50.430 --> 47:53.830
- Foster's. From the South.
- Down under. G'day, mate.

47:53.930 --> 47:55.910
- Hey ho, sir.
- Hey, Matt.

47:56.010 --> 47:58.670
Hey, Chad. How about a Crest?

47:58.770 --> 48:01.380
Yeah, I gotta talk to you now.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.400
Here, you need this.

48:04.860 --> 48:06.940
Crest, with tartar control.

48:08.070 --> 48:12.010
Listen, Matt,
I've got a real problem with Tara.

48:12.110 --> 48:15.230
I'd say that's the ugliest
little red dog I've ever seen.

48:15.330 --> 48:18.100
What I mean is, she's acting strange.

48:18.200 --> 48:20.310
Buddy, she likes you.

48:20.410 --> 48:22.330
You're no help at all.

48:27.340 --> 48:30.490
Listen, there's something
she isn't telling me about Gangreen

48:30.590 --> 48:34.850
and what happened up there.
I gotta find out what's going on.

48:40.180 --> 48:43.380
Good afternoon, sir. Have you any falafel?

48:43.480 --> 48:46.940
My God! It's Muammar Gaddafi!

48:47.900 --> 48:49.680
You lunatic!

48:49.780 --> 48:51.890
Where's the fight at?

49:26.520 --> 49:28.270
All right!

49:28.440 --> 49:31.490
All right, that's it! Everybody out!

49:32.280 --> 49:34.910
Ah man! Party pooper.

49:36.360 --> 49:37.770
You son of a...

49:37.870 --> 49:39.120
Uncle Wilbur!

49:45.040 --> 49:46.820
God, knock it off.

49:46.920 --> 49:49.320
It isn't Gaddafi. It's Sam Smith.

49:49.420 --> 49:53.630
Wilbur, it's me, your old buddy, Sam.
From the war.

49:54.300 --> 49:59.120
Sam! Still the master of disguise.
Sure had us fooled, huh, boys?

49:59.220 --> 50:01.710
It's amazing.
You remember him in "Beatlemania"?

50:01.810 --> 50:03.980
That was you? That was great.

50:04.980 --> 50:08.000
What brings you out this way?
I heard you still work for the government.

50:08.100 --> 50:13.180
Sure do. FVI.
Federal Vegetable Investigation.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.600
Federal Vegetable Investigation.

50:15.700 --> 50:18.470
We had a report
of tomato activity in this sector.

50:18.570 --> 50:20.850
You fellas know anything about this?

50:20.950 --> 50:24.620
Tomatoes? No, I've never
seen a tomato in my life.

50:25.040 --> 50:27.480
Officer, tomatoes are illegal.

50:27.580 --> 50:30.230
We wouldn't know about
anything illegal, right, Chad?

50:30.330 --> 50:31.320
Shut up, Matt.

50:31.420 --> 50:34.240
- No, sir.
- You can believe these boys, Sam.

50:34.340 --> 50:36.450
They know what
tomato activity can lead to.

50:36.550 --> 50:38.740
- Tell me what you've got.
- Telephone calls.

50:38.840 --> 50:43.540
This restaurant. This woman
was actually turned into a tomato.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.140
A woman tomato.

50:47.850 --> 50:49.460
- I knew it.
- What?

50:49.560 --> 50:51.760
- See that garbage truck?
- Yeah, what about it?

50:51.860 --> 50:53.470
I know I've seen it before.

50:53.570 --> 50:56.720
I saw it when we found
that thing Tara was chasing.

50:56.820 --> 50:59.450
The driver's following us. Or her.

50:59.570 --> 51:02.560
- I think you're imagining things.
- I don't imagine garbage trucks.

51:02.660 --> 51:05.960
Besides, there's got to be some kind
of reason why Tara left that place.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.440
Maybe this truck
has something to do with it.

51:08.540 --> 51:09.770
Let's follow it.

51:09.870 --> 51:14.580
You follow your own delusions.
I'm staying here. Have a Goobers.

51:19.220 --> 51:20.810
From the front of Finletter's Pizza,

51:20.930 --> 51:23.330
just down the street from H and L Block...

51:23.430 --> 51:24.620
The tax people.

51:24.720 --> 51:28.420
This is Igor speaking to you from
the Amalgamated cellular truck phone.

51:28.520 --> 51:32.050
- Amalgamated, we're number one.
- 'From the other end of your paycheck

51:32.150 --> 51:35.430
this is your boss, you weenie.
What have you found out?

51:35.530 --> 51:38.360
'I have the alleged boy spotted,
but Tara's not with him.'

51:38.490 --> 51:43.330
Good. Follow him home
after the pizza parlour closes tonight.

51:44.410 --> 51:47.770
Right now I need more solution
for the tomato transformation process.

51:47.870 --> 51:49.960
- 'Immediately! '
- Roger. That's a big 1040.

51:53.670 --> 51:56.297
I'll be right back
after this brief interruption.

54:53.760 --> 54:56.140
'Igor! '

55:06.860 --> 55:11.190
- Good, good. Put it down.
- OK.

55:33.510 --> 55:36.420
'Good afternoon and welcome
to the smorgasbord of sports.

55:41.150 --> 55:43.210
'Now let's take a look
at some of the taped highlights

55:43.310 --> 55:45.880
'of this morning's competition.

55:45.980 --> 55:48.220
'Today's action pits the United States

55:48.320 --> 55:50.640
'against mighty Holland. Look out!

55:50.740 --> 55:52.970
'There's a broadside
that just missed the mainland.

55:53.070 --> 55:58.770
'The American boat opens up full side.
Score one for the good old USA.

55:58.870 --> 56:00.820
'The Dutch boat is taking water...'

56:00.920 --> 56:07.410
Matt, toxic waste, Gangreen,
tomatoes, music, people!

56:07.510 --> 56:11.280
Slow down there, buddy.
Get a hold of yourself.

56:11.380 --> 56:16.330
I followed that truck.
Some sort of flunky for Gangreen,

56:16.430 --> 56:20.710
using toxic waste on tomatoes.
It was horrible.

56:20.810 --> 56:23.150
We've got to do something. What can...?

56:23.400 --> 56:25.460
Tara! I have to tell Tara!

56:25.560 --> 56:29.600
She should hear this.
No wonder she ran away.

56:30.780 --> 56:31.990
Honey...

56:52.130 --> 56:54.910
'Holland will literally sink
to the bottom of the standings.'

56:58.140 --> 57:00.230
Get out!

57:01.930 --> 57:04.140
I'm sorry, Chad!

57:19.160 --> 57:20.980
'Another broadside for the American boat.

57:21.080 --> 57:23.980
'I'm trying to see
the results through the smoke.

57:24.080 --> 57:28.030
'I got to tell you. This is what
real sports action is all about.

57:28.130 --> 57:33.280
'Just a cup, a sail, and a couple
of sidewinder missiles.'

57:34.880 --> 57:36.740
'Charlie, I couldn't agree with you more.

57:36.840 --> 57:39.080
'Ron Maxwell,
calling the action from dockside.

57:39.180 --> 57:40.580
'Those were highlights...'

57:40.680 --> 57:42.590
I can't believe she's a...

57:43.430 --> 57:44.630
tomato.

57:44.730 --> 57:47.050
Boy, I'll say she's a tomato.
She's got the best set of...

57:47.150 --> 57:50.970
Knock it off, will you?
I mean she's really a tomato.

57:51.070 --> 57:54.950
Ketchup makings. The real thing.

57:56.160 --> 57:59.980
The girl of my dreams is a vegetable.

58:00.080 --> 58:01.940
Buddy, come on, pizza man.

58:02.040 --> 58:06.520
Tomatoes, they're little red round things,
you know. There's a real woman.

58:06.620 --> 58:09.150
Don't you realise
what I've been trying to tell you?

58:09.250 --> 58:11.410
What I saw at Gangreen's lab?

58:12.510 --> 58:17.660
I discovered it. The key
to the whole thing. Don't you see?

58:17.760 --> 58:21.180
The secret is... music!

58:22.180 --> 58:26.090
We've got to find her
before she accidentally changes form.

58:26.190 --> 58:30.710
If she becomes a tomato
and is spotted by a crowd...

58:30.810 --> 58:33.100
- Come on...
- OK.

58:36.400 --> 58:38.110
Tara!

58:58.180 --> 59:00.580
Chad, come here! Come here! Look at this.

59:00.680 --> 59:02.770
I think this could be, look.

59:04.460 --> 59:06.640
No? I took a shot.

59:13.400 --> 59:15.630
All right. Come on.
Where do you think she's gone?

59:15.730 --> 59:17.720
I don't know... There!

59:17.820 --> 59:20.180
There, she's been there before.

59:21.660 --> 59:23.830
Music! She'll change back.

59:29.120 --> 59:30.910
Hey, Tara!

59:31.250 --> 59:33.210
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

59:38.130 --> 59:42.750
Tara? Honey, I know you're here
somewhere. Say something.

59:42.850 --> 59:44.560
Give me a sign.

59:46.520 --> 59:49.460
What are you guys doing?
Get out of my store.

59:49.560 --> 59:53.820
- It's a fraternity initiation. Alpha Beta...
- Out of here, now!

59:56.030 --> 59:58.340
- I think we've got to get out of here.
- Hey!

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.010
Now move it or lose it!

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:04.310
Right here, over here.
I got something to show you.

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.390
I'll be right back. And when I do,
you guys had better be gone.

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:09.980
Out of here!

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.740
Tara, where are you?
I'm sorry, please speak to me.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.530
Buddy, we ought to get out of here.

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:20.430
I'm not leaving without her.
I know she's here somewhere.

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:26.290
All right, look, just for the sake of
argument, let's suppose she's a tomato.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:29.040
Let's go so far as
to suppose that she's here.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.130
How do you tell one tomato from another?

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:33.090
Are we going to check the stems?

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:35.980
Then I guess we'll just have
to take them all, won't we?

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:40.760
I'll get a cart.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.020
'50 bucks? That's too much.
And this one is deformed.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.090
'It's a hairy.'

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.940
FT? Tara?

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:59.470
Oh, come on, baby.
You're safe with me now.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:14.380
'We'll return to our movie thriller
"Frankenstein's Mummy"...'

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:23.560
I know music is what makes you change.
So why is nothing working?

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:32.500
At least speak to me. Say something.

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:40.760
I'm sorry I reacted that way.
It was a shock.

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:48.750
We can work this out.
I just need some time.

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:52.120
I love you as much as ever, darling.
Please believe me.

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:58.670
'And now, the exciting conclusion
of "Frankenstein's Mummy".'

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:06.140
'At last I have perfected the equipment

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.100
'that will allow me to transform
my creation into human form.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:17.570
'And it's all right here,
in my own secret laboratory. Ha-ha!

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:21.610
'Yes, right here in my secret lab

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:27.340
'I can transform this creature
into a human being!

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.630
'I said, transform...

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:38.380
'into human being.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.590
'My secret laboratory.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.090
'La-bo-ra-to-ry

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:43.560
'I mentioned.'

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:50.060
Of course. That's it! The professor's lab.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.690
We can use his equipment
to change her back to human form.

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:55.520
Matt!

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.990
'It's about time.'

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:01.530
Matt, buddy, get up.
The professor's lab, come on.

01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:04.110
We'll use his equipment.
I've watched him work it.

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:07.210
We can transform her back to human form.

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.330
- Are you Rob Lowe?
- You're not Matt.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:15.330
No, buddy, no. My girl, OK? My girl.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:20.050
Now, listen, you want to find your girl?
You go to the produce department. OK?

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:23.050
But Matt, I figured it out.
We can bust into his lab.

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:25.010
We'll use his equipment.

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:30.160
Here, hold this. I got one thing
to say to you, the Women of Mensa.

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:35.600
- Hey, I need you.
- Come on, I need her.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.650
Matt, I'm your best friend.
I saved your life.

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.110
- One time.
- Twice.

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:42.590
Two times. And it was...

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.130
Two, yeah... I'll be right back.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:06.180
I'll take my quadrunner.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.930
Well, if you take your quadrunner
from Hondo of San Diego,

01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.050
I'll take my quadrunner.

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:14.480
We will each take a Honda quadrunner
from Honda of San Diego.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.480
They have excellent acceleration
and superb ridability.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.560
And aren't they number one in sales, Matt?

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:23.230
That's right, Chad. Not to mention
great gas mileage and did you know...?

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:26.750
Do we have enough money
to finish this turkey yet?

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.510
Yeah, sure, give them hell, guys.

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.630
Thank you.

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:54.970
- Stay close.
- This close?

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:57.150
- No, let go of me.
- Hold on.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.130
Help me open the window.

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:26.340
Get in.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.780
Shh, come on, get in here!

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:42.120
Let go of me.

01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:46.820
OK, now where?

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.510
I don't know. I just looked through
that hole in the wall.

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:53.040
The lab can't be too hard to find.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.370
Green comes downstairs,
there's the Hardy Boys.

01:05:57.470 --> 01:06:02.100
What are we supposed to do?
Look for a sign that says laboratory?

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.860
I can read.

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:18.350
Hey, Matt, this looks like the place.
Now if you'll just let go of me.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.520
Now we're in business.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.100
Look at this stuff!

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:28.280
Wait, you know what you're doing here?

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:31.720
Yeah, I watched him do it.
It's a piece of cake.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.420
Now, put a glove on.

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.830
All right, switch.

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.920
You said you knew what you were doing.

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.020
They all look alike.

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:55.920
See. Now, you take Tara...

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.970
...carefully,

01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:01.110
and put her in that container
of green liquid.

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:04.000
OK.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.610
Hurry up.

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:11.530
And Matt, be very careful when
you're putting her in. That's toxic waste.

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:15.340
- Toxic waste.
- You're soaking in it.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.200
That should do it.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.720
Now, put her in that cylinder.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.600
Perfect.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:38.100
Now, watch this.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.870
Who's that?

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.160
Carmen Miranda.

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.470
- That's what I thought.
- Something is very wrong.

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:18.990
Hey, Pope.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.830
- I say we stop right here.
- No, it's not her!

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:51.470
And it never will be.

01:08:54.939 --> 01:08:56.939
I'm a happy camper.

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:17.050
I don't know what plans you had
for this tomato, but...

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.359
...they're over.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.779
No!

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.790
Enough of this foolishness.

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:34.750
Since you seem so intent
on visiting my humble abode,

01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:36.930
I should make you feel welcome.

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:42.109
Igor, show them to the, er... guest room.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:45.810
We don't have a guest room, sir.
All we've got is a dungeon.

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:49.270
"Guest room" is a euphemism
for dungeon, chowderhead!

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:52.850
- Must I always be literal?
- Move it, boys.

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:54.270
Go...

01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:55.990
Now, go!

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:59.420
Wait, wait, come here!
Come here. See that?

01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:01.860
Now how many girls
can you make with that thing?

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.780
You know, like twins with big...

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.210
Move it, twerp.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.260
Let's go.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.020
Uh-oh.

01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:14.170
Oh! Nice digs. Who does your decorating?

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:15.250
- Inside.
- Hey, wait...

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:18.670
- He mushed my girl.
- Yeah.

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:20.390
Great!

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:23.530
All right, this is just great.

01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:27.970
Can't you think of anything
but your own comfort?

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.610
You saw what that freak did to Tara.

01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:38.280
I'm sorry, buddy, I wasn't thinking.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:42.420
All right, let's find a way
to get out of here.

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:44.070
OK.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:48.180
- What's that noise?
- Mice?

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.140
Big mouse.

01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:55.460
No, it's horrible creatures,

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.920
it's giant zucchini
and man-eating artichokes!

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.150
Shut up! I'll handle this, all right.

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:07.900
Yo! Zucchini...

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.400
Tara?

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.230
Chad...

01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.070
Tara...

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:22.400
I thought you never wanted
to see me again.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.580
I thought you were ketchup.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.930
I'm so sorry I deceived you.

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:32.410
- I'm the one who's sorry.
- Look, look... excuse me.

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:36.170
I'm glad you're alive.
I hate to break up a love scene,

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.250
but I just thought that I would point out

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:40.670
that instead of two of us
being stuck in here,

01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:43.320
it's now three of us stuck in here.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.300
Good point.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.530
Hello... Hello?

01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:50.530
FT! FT!

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.890
FT! FT, is that you?

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:00.170
It's him.

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:04.530
FT, you have to tell Uncle Wilbur
where we are.

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:06.780
- He can get us out of here.
- It's never going to work.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.450
- He won't understand him.
- Well, we could write a note.

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:14.370
Swell. Where we going
to get paper to write a note?

01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:16.340
- Use a page from my script.
- Perfect.

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:18.980
Got a pen? Great.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.920
FT, listen. You have to take
this note to Wilbur Finletter.

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.340
You remember Wilbur Finletter? Good.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.550
Hurry, FT.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:33.770
You have to run as fast
as your little feet will take you.

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:35.700
Hurry! Go! Go!

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:40.780
I hope he makes it out before July.

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.300
Tomato!

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.740
A bit deformed,
but it's a tomato all right.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.550
Freeze! Don't move!

01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:58.850
I got you!

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.520
All right, now talk!

01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:08.440
What's this?

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:12.260
I don't know how you got this,
but it's Chad's handwriting all right.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.520
"Uncle Wilbur.
Please do not harm this tomato.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.390
"I'm a prisoner of Professor Gangreen."

01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:20.810
Prisoner? Where's Matt?

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:24.820
"Matt is here also. This tomato
can show you where we are."

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.280
He knows I don't trust tomatoes.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:31.320
"Now I know you don't trust tomatoes,
but trust this one for once.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.160
"Signed, your nephew, Chad."

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.890
All right, you red scum.
This better be for real,

01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:43.890
or it's the blender for you.
Can't do it alone. I'll need help.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.260
'This American team is
a fired up bunch of patriots.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.840
'After crushing the Portuguese fleet
yesterday afternoon.'

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.470
- Hello.
- 'Sam! Get over here.'

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:54.930
Gonna need your help
fighting the red menace again.

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:58.240
- Communists, huh?
- Worse. Tomatoes.

01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:00.660
Tomatoes? I'll be right there!

01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.330
Come on, Greg. Let's go.

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:54.070
Welcome, men. Glad you could make it.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:58.030
This is our objective. Gangreen's place.

01:14:58.130 --> 01:15:00.630
He won't slip through
some legal loophole this time.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.880
We're behind you all the way.

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:05.750
And this is our insurance.

01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:07.270
Grab him, Sam.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:23.360
World domination, boys. World domination.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.740
I will be satisfied with nothing less.

01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:38.000
You'll never get away with this,
you slime. Crime doesn't pay.

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.380
Yeah, ditto.

01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:46.580
Really boys, save the melodramatics
for your acting classes.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.680
Of course crime pays. This is real life!

01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:51.940
This isn't some game!

01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:57.010
We're on to you, Gangreen.
We know all about your tomato people.

01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:58.450
You're finished.

01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:04.230
Don't make me laugh. Your feeble plan
to stop me has failed, Finletter.

01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:07.080
You think this is all there is?

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:13.330
No, no, no, my dear boy.
There is much, much more.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:20.040
As you've seen, my tomatoes
can be made to resemble anyone.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.910
The chief of police. A congressman.

01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:26.170
The President himself!

01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:29.130
With my scientific genius

01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:37.190
and Jim Richardson's political savvy,
we will not fail again!

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.340
Come, Igor.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.220
We must get to the prison on time.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.180
If the garbage truck
doesn't make its regular schedule,

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.890
it will arouse suspicion.

01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:49.560
Now you have placed
the tomatoes on the truck?

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.480
We're loaded, ready to roll, Professor.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.160
Good, good, good. So long, boys.

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:56.650
Wait, what about Tara?

01:16:56.750 --> 01:17:00.870
You forget. She is my creation.

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:04.970
I made her for my needs
and it is my needs that she serves!

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.840
You wouldn't believe what she can do
with six milk bottles and a tuning fork.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.800
You rat!

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.330
Calm down, Mr Finletter.

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:24.450
In just ten minutes you'll be a tomato.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:29.560
Don't worry about it. It's not so bad.

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.790
After all, you could have been a rutabaga.

01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:37.010
No, no. I'll do the laughing,
if you please.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:41.040
See you in a salsa.

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:51.590
To the prison, Igor.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.760
Oh, my God.

01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:21.720
- Guards! Damn!
- We need a distraction.

01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:26.250
- That little fink.
- Oops.

01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:35.550
There's our diversion.

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.880
What do you know about that?

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.380
A regular Tonto.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.060
Let's go.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.910
So, where are they?

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:15.380
This place must have 50 rooms. It's big.

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.130
We'll have to spread out.

01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:18.540
If you hear anything,

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.880
anything at all,

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:22.220
use the secret call.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.700
The secret call. Yeah.

01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:33.910
Mummy... Mummy...

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:36.440
Mummy... Mummy...

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.540
Mummy... Mummy...

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:44.180
Will you be my friend? Help, help!

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:50.220
Murder, murder. Wait, stop!

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.120
Stop. Danger.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.320
He's dead. He's dead...

01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:31.910
The secret's out. Hi ho Silver! Away!

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.850
Uncle!

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.270
The timer!

01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:44.730
The timer! The timer!

01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:47.080
The timer!

01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:53.200
Get up!

01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:01.940
Get up!

01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:10.680
Time out! Time out!

01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:22.230
- Nice move.
- Thank you.

01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:25.940
Now hurry up, Uncle Wilbur.
We only have a few seconds left.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.570
That was our last time out.

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:48.970
Let go of me!

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:53.050
Hang on, Wilbur. We're coming.

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:54.720
Ah!

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.950
Ghost! Wilbur?

01:22:57.570 --> 01:22:59.320
- Get the door!
- Get the door!

01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:01.370
You got the door!

01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:09.110
Tara! We have to get to the prison
and save Tara. Come on. Let's go!

01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:14.510
Let's go! Let's go!

01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:16.530
Matt?

01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:20.210
- Come on, Matt.
- But the blonde there...

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.160
No!

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:25.970
I'm so alone, I'll be back!

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.430
Follow me, men. To the prison!

01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:43.280
Got to get to the prison!
Come on, everybody!

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.750
One, two, one, two...

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:49.620
Get up!

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.300
Let's go! Fire 'em up!

01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:59.720
FT? Where's FT? Come on, buddy, let's go!

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:02.450
FT!

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:05.890
Hang on, fuzzball.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.900
Here, here!

01:24:19.530 --> 01:24:21.530
No!

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.380
All right. Right here.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.690
Right here. Hurry! Hurry!

01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:34.200
No!

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.040
Quickly, go!

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.420
Don't lose them.

01:24:57.690 --> 01:25:00.970
Open the door!

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:11.250
- Sam, get the gate! Open it up!
- OK.

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:16.830
Hurry, Sam.

01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:02.160
OK, FT, you stay here and guard
the bikes. Matt, you come with me.

01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:04.240
- I'll guard the bikes.
- FT's guarding the bikes.

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.540
- I don't like FT.
- You're coming with me.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.020
- I'll go with you.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:24.570
Come on.
I'll guard the flank, you go ahead.

01:26:33.330 --> 01:26:35.130
Ready.

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.170
Aim.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.420
No!

01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:51.770
Fire!

01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:05.940
Tomatoes.

01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:14.960
Charge!

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:20.370
Let's get 'em!

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.760
Tara!

01:27:46.690 --> 01:27:51.520
I will not be mocked any longer.
I was a star in the first film...

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:54.390
You give me two lousy lines
in this picture.

01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:57.200
I want my agent. I want my publicist...

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.760
Please!

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.660
I'm really bad.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.260
- Yeah.
- Let's go, men!

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.800
Tara!

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:25.150
Don't move, or she gets it!

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.800
It'll take more than that to scare me.

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.000
How about this hand grenade?

01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:36.270
That'll do it.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:54.580
Hello? No, I don't know
the secret word for today.

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.330
You have ten seconds.

01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:59.540
I said I don't know the...

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:30.340
You notice how everything we set up
in the first reel pays off in the last?

01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:33.390
- Pretty swift, huh?
- Not everything.

01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.630
Everything.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.810
A grenade!

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:17.790
Tara!

01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:20.410
No, come on, nobody can survive that gas.

01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:22.080
Listen to me.

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:23.890
There's nothing you can do.

01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:02.430
Sorry, buddy.

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.530
Tara!

01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:15.680
I don't understand.
How could you have survived?

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.430
You forget, I'm not human.

01:31:17.530 --> 01:31:21.060
I don't care what you are,
as long as we're together.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.140
Then you'd better get used
to her on your salads.

01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:30.110
OK, wait. You're supposed
to be a tomato. What happened?

01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:32.440
Zounds! Should have known it.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:35.990
Once you've been gassed,
you'll never be a real tomato again.

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.680
You mean I'm human permanently?

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:44.370
FVI . Take these men away.

01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:49.100
No prison on earth can hold me, Tara.
Tomorrow is another day.

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:52.010
Does this mean
we'll be on the news tonight?

01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:53.990
Oh, cut that out.

01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:58.610
Ding dong, the witch is dead. Yeah.

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:01.870
- Right there, guys.
- Yes!

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.160
Where's FT?

01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:12.360
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen a vegetable do.

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:13.440
Yeah.

01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:16.870
Maybe tomatoes can be
of some good after all.

01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:42.730
FT's all right.

01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:46.020
FT's alive!

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.980
He's all right! Hey, guys, it's the press!

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:53.280
It's all right.
Hey, all right, I was not alone.

01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:56.150
The people I want to thank...
It was mostly me, but...

01:32:56.250 --> 01:32:58.950
Wait, come on, look,
I jumped in this window and I was...

01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:02.910
- Major Finletter, what happened here?
- How did you stop this terrible plan?

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:04.850
Is it true you wear women's underwear?

01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:07.040
Wrong man! Wrong man.

01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:09.790
There's your hero.
That's the little fella that saved the day.

01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:11.760
Right here. Right there...

01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:39.760
Isn't he the cutest thing, Daddy?

01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:44.790
Daddy, buy me an FT doll! Please, Daddy!

01:33:44.890 --> 01:33:48.460
Why, of course, dear. Who wouldn't
want one of these cute little dolls?

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.920
They're the perfect gift
for any boy or girl

01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:53.170
and they're on sale
in the lobby of this theatre.

01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:56.420
If not, ask at your favourite toy
or department store.

01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.430
Don't let your child be left out.
Christmas isn't very far away.

01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:02.570
I love you, FT.

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.540
- I want an FT!
- I want an FT!

01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:21.620
FT! FT!

01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:26.420
FT! FT!

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:03.280
- A fine couple.
- Yeah.

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.780
Have you seen Matt?

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.950
He said he was going back to destroy
that transformation equipment.

01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:10.620
- Good idea. He's a fine boy, too.
- Yeah.

01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:20.340
# Like poetry in motion
Like a perfect wave

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:23.470
# Gonna ride with the winds
Spend the money and save

01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:26.640
# 'Cause summer's here
and I got nothing to do

01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.390
# But get my rocks off

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:36.170
# When those big-breasted tomatoes
go to the beach #

01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:40.400
Hold it right there!
Where do you think you're going?

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:45.910
My son and a lot of other people
have worked hard on this movie.

01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:49.990
You sit right there
and watch these credits!

01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:51.960
# And take their tops off

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.460
# Those California girls
that just love the best

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.920
# They got an even tan
all over their chests

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:03.090
# I'll be California dreaming
till the sun goes down

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:06.300
# I get around, round,
get around, I get around

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.680
# Those southern girls how they hypnotise

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:12.970
# Got the cutest way of talking
And I like their eyes

01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:16.100
# But those New York girls
You got to see them drivin'

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.940
# With their tops down

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.170
# When those big-breasted girls
go to the beach

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.930
# And take their tops off

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:35.220
# Those big-breasted girls go to the beach

01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:41.610
# And I love to see her swaying

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:47.690
# She got a rhythm of her own

01:36:50.150 --> 01:36:56.600
# Someday soon if I keep praying, praying

01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:00.440
# She might see how big I've grown

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:04.800
# And won't it be fine

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.740
# Now summer's gone but she's on my mind

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.910
# After one night's kiss
I had to leave her behind

01:37:12.010 --> 01:37:16.500
# So it's back to school
If only I can get me through it #

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.370
'Well, what did you think
of that one, Sid?'

01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:21.750
'That had to be one
of the worst movies I ever saw.'

01:37:21.850 --> 01:37:24.420
'But it's all part of the business,
running turkeys like that.'

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.596
'Listen, Bob, when can we show
"big-breasted women

01:37:26.696 --> 01:37:28.620
go to the beach
and take their tops off" again?

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.930
- I'd like that.
- Let's do that tomorrow.

01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:33.760
All right. Who let those carrots in here?

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.860
Hey, you carrots, get off the stage!

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.984
Hey, wait a minute.
You guys can't come in here.
