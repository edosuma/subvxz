01:05.899 --> 01:06.800
Okay, everybody.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.437
It's time for the weekly
Bundy baby progress report.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.508
Well, I can sense your excitement.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.311
So even though one of us is missing,
I think we should still begin.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.747
Let's start with the reading of the
minutes from our last meeting. Kelly?

01:26.186 --> 01:27.654
"At the beginning of the last meeting...

01:27.855 --> 01:30.257
...I suggested we have
no more meetings.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.927
It was seconded by Bud, my brother...

01:34.127 --> 01:35.762
...and Dad, my daddy.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.866
We stared dully at Mom
and then were forced...

01:39.066 --> 01:41.468
...into a chorus of
'We Love the Baby.'

01:41.668 --> 01:42.836
Then Mom left to pee...

01:43.036 --> 01:45.639
...and Dad suggested
that we play a gleeful round...

01:45.839 --> 01:47.708
...of 'How Fat is She? '

01:50.444 --> 01:52.846
Dad guessed 415 pounds.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.782
We all laughed, and Dad said:

01:55.983 --> 01:57.951
'Don't write this down, Pumpkin."'

01:59.186 --> 02:01.054
That concludes my report.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.225
Let the record show
your father is a weenie.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.062
And now, can we have a report
from the treasury?

02:16.403 --> 02:19.873
Let the record show your father
has nothing in his pants.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.485
Oh, my God. Baby meeting!

02:31.885 --> 02:34.288
Get back here, young man!

02:34.688 --> 02:37.591
Yeah, pay your respect to the fetus
just like the rest of us.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.800
Most glorious
inhabitant of the womb...

02:48.335 --> 02:51.004
...please accept the blessing
of this unworthy one.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.607
I love you more than I love myself.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.209
Hail baby.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.315
The baby is pleased.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.683
You may sit.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.785
Listen, I have great news.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.855
As the only intelligent
living male Bundy...

03:08.689 --> 03:10.657
...I'm proud to announce
I've gotten a scholarship...

03:10.858 --> 03:12.359
...and I'm going to junior college.

03:12.759 --> 03:15.395
And just how does that
pertain to the baby?

03:16.096 --> 03:16.930
Thank you.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.866
So I decided to start college
across town...

03:19.199 --> 03:21.168
...instead of this neighbourhood,
where I'm accused...

03:21.368 --> 03:22.936
...of being a total social failure.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.105
Don't be so hard on yourself, Bud.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.473
I'm sure lots of cool guys...

03:26.673 --> 03:28.809
...spend their Friday nights
watching Star Trek reruns...

03:28.976 --> 03:32.045
...hoping to catch a glimpse
of Klingon cleavage.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.952
Let the record show that I was
wetting the screen with my tongue...

03:39.152 --> 03:40.354
...to clean it.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.060
To continue...

03:47.294 --> 03:48.562
Chicks love new blood.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.697
So I'm assuming
a whole new identity.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.866
As of now, my story is
I'm a bad-boy rapper...

03:53.066 --> 03:54.701
...from the streets of New York.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.905
Goodbye, Bud Bundy.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.440
Hello, Grandmaster B.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.711
What does the B stand for?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.280
"Brother of an idiot."

04:10.184 --> 04:11.418
Anyhow, if anyone asks...

04:11.618 --> 04:13.387
...my parents sent me here
to clean up my act...

04:13.587 --> 04:16.490
...because I either killed a guy
or spray-painted a tree or something.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.160
Excuse me, but isn't that the plot
for The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.996
Well, that's an NBC show,
so who would know that?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.839
So if anyone asks,
I'm not related to any of you.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.107
And I'm coolly dangerous.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.011
I am not going
to be dateless this year.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.747
- Now, if you've finished, Bud...
- B.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.599
And just yesterday he was in diapers.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.667
Literally.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.637
I killed a man in New York, you know.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.273
Forgive me, Ghostbuster B.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.409
It's Grandmaster B.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.744
Of course, honey.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.779
Now, let's get back
to the baby meeting.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.048
Given the fact, and I would like
this to go on record...

05:15.249 --> 05:17.017
...that your father earns nothing...

05:17.217 --> 05:19.219
...it seems that we'll be
a little pressed for room...

05:19.419 --> 05:20.921
...when the blessed event comes.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.689
- Hail baby.
- Hail baby.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.394
Who is loved more than all babies
that came before him.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.129
Now, since we have limited space...

05:29.329 --> 05:32.099
...I would like to move that the baby
share a room with Daddy and me.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.301
We'll just put a crib
at the foot of the bed.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.572
I would like the record to show...

05:38.805 --> 05:41.441
...that I would rather sleep
in a bunk bed under Oprah.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.481
I would rather engage
in a frolicking threesome...

05:47.681 --> 05:49.716
...with Roseanne
and her cool husband.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.188
I would rather play naked Twister...

05:54.354 --> 05:56.823
...with every one
of the Golden Girls...

05:57.925 --> 06:01.461
...than have that little screaming
doodie geyser at the foot of my bed.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.465
I've said my piece. Thank you.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.436
Hail baby.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.005
All right then, let's have a vote.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.676
All those in favour of the baby sharing
a room with Mommy and Daddy?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.045
- Opposed?
- I must use my veto power.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.248
- Motion is carried.
- Veto! Veto, I say!

06:21.582 --> 06:24.017
All right, everybody, I'll see you
at the next baby meeting.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.720
But for now, Mommy
must use the bathroom.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.789
Al, if you would be so kind...

06:29.056 --> 06:29.890
I'm warning you, Peg.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.758
You will not make a mockery
of my veto power.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.428
I am the man of the house,
and my will is law!

06:39.933 --> 06:43.036
For the record,
she's now up to 500 pounds.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.076
This is my temporary crib, babe.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.914
Thanks for carrying my books.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.818
Anything to help keep
your gun hand free...

06:58.018 --> 06:59.386
...Mixmaster B.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.523
That's Grandmaster B.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.525
And I don't carry a gun anymore.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.260
Because I have a new life
here in Bel-Air...

07:06.460 --> 07:08.095
I mean, Chicago.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.331
Have I shown you my scar?

07:12.032 --> 07:14.835
You scare and excite me
when you talk like that.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.837
Take me.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.440
First, do it for me, B.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.043
Give me your rap.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.212
All right.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.177
And now...

07:58.111 --> 07:59.246
You may take me.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.614
Thank you.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.949
No problem.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.988
Well, look.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.758
My little man
is getting his first kiss.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.196
You're the coolest, Grandma B.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.100
That's Grandmaster B.

08:21.101 --> 08:21.902
Look, babe...

08:22.102 --> 08:24.471
...I think I'm going to have to rap
my way out of the rent now.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.973
You go on home
and wait by the phone.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.076
If I call and you're not there,
you go to the bottom of the list.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.582
What did I tell you two?!

08:37.417 --> 08:38.619
I am Grandmaster B.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.554
Grand. Master. B.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.457
Mom, I'm cool. You're
ruining it for me! I'm cool.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.594
Gee, I'm really sorry,
Grand Marshal B.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.832
No, Mom, I think it's Bed-Wetter B.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.169
Are you sure? I thought
it was Court Jester B.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.938
Peg! Peg!

08:58.338 --> 08:59.873
Guess what I found in the attic?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.609
It's something of my father's
that served him well for 20 years.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.712
And now, will serve me
for the rest of my life.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.414
A pair of socks?

09:08.382 --> 09:10.317
Bud, what do you think I found?

09:10.517 --> 09:12.886
If it's a rubber woman, Dad,
I can explain.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.023
You send away
for one Archie comic...

09:16.223 --> 09:18.225
...the next thing you know,
they put you on a list...

09:21.328 --> 09:22.496
Pumpkin?

09:23.163 --> 09:24.865
You found a pumpkin, Daddy?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.435
Well, I guess I'll tell you all...

09:28.635 --> 09:30.938
...since none of you
singly deserve to know.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.441
I found my father's hammer.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.913
This hammer has been
in my family for generations.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.350
With this, my father hit
the now-famous Bundy nail.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.185
And upon that nail,
he did hang his hat.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.891
My dad had one great dream...

09:51.091 --> 09:52.659
...and that dream was handed down...

09:52.860 --> 09:55.062
...from generation to generation
of male Bundys:

09:55.262 --> 09:56.396
To build their own room...

09:56.597 --> 09:58.765
...and live separately from their wives.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.668
Sadly, they all failed.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.271
No, genetically they all failed.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.607
Well, not me! I'm going to do it!

10:07.174 --> 10:09.409
Look, Dad. I've got your hammer.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.912
Your little boy's
gonna build his own room.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.681
Mom, who is he talking to?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.517
Grandpa.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.918
Hi, Grandpa.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.995
Look, Dad, I'm building my own room.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.598
I'll dedicate the first nail to you.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.771
Damn cheap Sheetrock!

10:39.740 --> 10:42.209
I can't believe you're gonna let
that moron move out of your room.

10:42.576 --> 10:45.712
Marcie, you're assuming
he can actually do this.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.047
You know the Bundy legacy:

10:47.247 --> 10:50.651
What they don't finish in 30 seconds,
they never finish.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.487
Besides, you know, it's important...

10:53.687 --> 10:55.556
...to let your man fail
in front of your eyes.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.491
It's a great thing to see.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.160
You know the fun we have
watching them fail at sex.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.428
Do I ever.

11:01.628 --> 11:02.996
Like when you say:

11:03.197 --> 11:04.698
"It's okay, honey.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.167
I'm sure it happens to all men.

11:08.902 --> 11:12.673
It doesn't mean there's anything
wrong with you, does it?"

11:15.242 --> 11:16.810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Or when you say:

11:17.010 --> 11:19.146
"It's okay, honey.
You're probably just tired...

11:19.346 --> 11:21.348
...and unsure of your manhood."

11:21.548 --> 11:23.317
Or, " It's okay.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.919
We can just lay here
and hold each other.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.021
That's just as good."

11:29.022 --> 11:31.358
Then when they lay their head
on you like a child, trembling...

11:31.558 --> 11:34.461
...it is just as good.
God, you just want to laugh.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.334
Well, believe me when I tell you, it is
just as much fun to watch them fail...

11:40.534 --> 11:42.269
...with their clothes on.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.004
Watch.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.140
I can't get the nails
to go in straight.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.410
Gee, honey, it's probably just
because you're tired...

11:50.611 --> 11:52.346
...and unsure of your manhood.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.048
I did not fail.
I'll build that room! I will, it's just...

11:55.449 --> 11:57.684
I've got a lot on my mind right now.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.694
Mom, do you think he's actually
doing something in there?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.397
Honey, must I remind you
of his family tree?

12:10.597 --> 12:12.499
Do we not remember Amadeus Bundy?

12:12.699 --> 12:14.868
Who, when Alexander Graham Bell
patented the telephone...

12:15.068 --> 12:18.138
...tried to patent shouting
as a cheaper alternative?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.073
Or how about Wrong-Way Bundy...

12:20.274 --> 12:21.808
...the original inventor of the shotgun.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.912
Only he never quite perfected
which way to point it.

12:25.379 --> 12:27.447
We later called him Headless Bundy.

12:28.549 --> 12:30.717
But, Mom, Dad's not like the others.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.452
He sells shoes.

12:34.788 --> 12:35.989
It's done!

12:36.190 --> 12:38.892
Now, come in and take your
first and last look.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.528
All right now, kids. Daddy has
worked very, very hard at this.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.063
And it means a lot to him.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.399
So nobody laugh until I do.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.014
Wow, Al. You did all this
with just a hammer?

13:01.215 --> 13:02.916
Not just a hammer, Peg.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.118
Dad's hammer.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.726
Al, you're not really thinking
about moving away...

13:12.926 --> 13:14.027
...from me and the baby.

13:14.228 --> 13:15.796
Thinking of it? I've done it!

13:18.165 --> 13:19.933
Be gone, jackals!

13:20.667 --> 13:22.069
But, Al...

13:35.215 --> 13:36.483
At last...

13:36.717 --> 13:40.087
...I can do what every
male Bundy wants to do.

13:48.529 --> 13:49.730
Well, they're out of sight.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.266
I wonder how long it'll take
till they're out of mind.

13:53.634 --> 13:54.835
Done.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.805
Well, that must be that life I ordered.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.179
Hi, Al.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.949
Please, Al, let me stay with you.

14:09.183 --> 14:12.753
I'm afraid of Marcie.
She wants sex all the time.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.888
I mean, having sex
with your pregnant wife...

14:15.088 --> 14:17.224
...it's like putting gas
in the tank of a car...

14:17.391 --> 14:19.193
...you've already wrecked.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.299
Thank God mine pulls
into self-service.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.937
Al? Al, I'm begging you.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.606
I mean, you remember what it was
like when you first got married?

14:32.806 --> 14:35.609
Sex wasn't enough.
They also want, God help me...

14:35.809 --> 14:36.944
...foreplay.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.813
There, now, now, now. Al's here.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.449
Take it easy, now, big fella.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.651
Save me.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.221
All right, but just one night.
And on one condition:

14:47.421 --> 14:49.189
- What?
- It's just you and me...

14:49.389 --> 14:51.458
...and you don't tell
one single guy about this place.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.926
I swear.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.795
Hey, Bobby, throw me that.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.364
Tater storm.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.835
Maybe I wasn't being clear
when I said tell no one.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.838
Come on, Al. It's okay. We're
just having some good, clean...

15:05.038 --> 15:06.707
...normal, guy fun.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.675
Come on, pull my finger.

15:14.448 --> 15:16.083
Hey, Al, it's my arm.

15:16.884 --> 15:19.086
And I thought I ran with
a cool pack in high school.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.755
Do you mind if we turn out the lights
and tell some scary stories?

15:21.955 --> 15:23.790
Gee, I thought we'd strip
down to our underwear...

15:23.991 --> 15:26.226
...and sing "Puff the Magic Dragon."

15:27.761 --> 15:29.696
My underwear's got a hole in it.

15:30.164 --> 15:31.765
Well, then maybe you
can play the guitar.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.434
What's wrong with you idiots?

15:34.635 --> 15:37.437
Any second, the women are going
to come pouring through that door.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.840
Don't you know they can sense
a man smiling a mile away?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.408
Al, don't worry about it.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.044
I had all the guys promise that
they wouldn't tell anyone. Right?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.279
- We swear!
- We swear!

15:45.913 --> 15:48.782
And so I move that this room
shall be our clubhouse...

15:49.016 --> 15:51.418
...for our newly formed
ladies group W.O.M. B...

15:51.618 --> 15:55.455
...which stands for
"Women Owe Men Bubkes."

15:56.223 --> 15:58.025
- All in favour?
- Aye!

15:58.225 --> 16:00.127
- Opposed?
- Veto.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.629
Motion carried.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.233
Now, ladies, are there any complaints
that we'd like to share?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.001
I got hemorrhoids.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.205
I've got varicose veins.

16:11.405 --> 16:14.274
Well, I've got an itch
my husband refuses to scratch.

16:16.410 --> 16:17.544
Excuse me...

16:17.778 --> 16:19.813
...where do we go when
we're feeling emotional?

16:21.014 --> 16:22.683
We can use Al's bathroom.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.355
Thou shalt not insult my bowl
with pregnant heinies.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.159
Where are you going, Al?

16:32.359 --> 16:34.528
Ladies, and by that
I mean you guys...

16:36.597 --> 16:38.065
...I'm going to tear this room asunder.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.634
It is evil. It has been tainted,
woman-ed!

16:41.268 --> 16:43.136
It must be destroyed.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.676
Keep the gates open, Dad!

16:49.910 --> 16:51.879
I got a busload coming for you!

16:53.213 --> 16:55.115
Go for it, son.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.761
Well, for this special baby meeting...

17:07.961 --> 17:09.762
...we'd like to welcome Daddy back.

17:09.963 --> 17:12.733
A man who kept his garage up
for five hours.

17:12.933 --> 17:15.669
Just four hours longer than he
could keep his zipper up.

17:16.637 --> 17:17.871
Let the record show...

17:18.070 --> 17:20.339
...that the chairperson
shares not only the wit...

17:20.540 --> 17:22.742
...but also the body
of Buddy Hackett.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.012
Duly noted.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.413
Let it further show...

17:26.646 --> 17:29.149
...that Daddy also discovered
an important thing today.

17:29.650 --> 17:33.153
The true legacy of Dad's hammer
is failure.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.355
Dad failed with it, I failed with it...

17:35.556 --> 17:37.825
...and every male Bundy
who comes after me will fail with it.

17:38.025 --> 17:40.661
And speaking of failure,
where's the other male Bundy?

17:41.995 --> 17:43.831
You mean the Bushwhacker?

17:44.798 --> 17:46.500
No, it's the Burgermeister.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.170
No, it's the Buckminster.
What is the difference?

17:50.537 --> 17:51.505
Where is the little boil?

17:53.774 --> 17:55.108
Where'd you get this scar?

17:55.309 --> 17:56.910
Was it in Desert Storm?

17:58.078 --> 18:00.214
Well, I had my own little
Desert Storm, baby...

18:00.414 --> 18:02.015
...in the streets of New York.

18:02.216 --> 18:05.185
Yep. We're the warriors that
don't get the ticker-tape parades.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.020
Oh, Grandflasher.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.057
That's Grandmaster.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.093
Now, kiss me before I do.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.172
Dustbuster?
Dustbuster, are you okay?

18:26.073 --> 18:28.208
Shut up. I'm dying, you buffoon!

18:28.842 --> 18:31.645
Mommy! Mommy!

18:32.305 --> 18:38.833
