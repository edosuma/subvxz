00:31.320 --> 00:34.200
Major Carter, Dr Jackson, Teal'c.
Glad you could make it.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.480
Agent Barrett.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.920
- How's Colonel O'Neill?
- Still recovering. Taking some time off.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.560
We're still putting the details together.
Follow me. I'll explain.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.640
- What is this place?
- An abandoned industrial complex.

00:45.720 --> 00:49.840
It was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell
we've been trying to locate for over a year.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.560
- Still haven't got them all?
- Not by a long shot.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.440
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources.

00:56.520 --> 01:00.040
- What were they doing here?
- We're not exactly sure yet.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.920
What happened?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.200
At approximately 0800 hours this morning,
we intercepted a 911 call.

01:06.280 --> 01:10.520
We moved in just after local authorities
arrived and have been in lockdown mode.

01:10.600 --> 01:15.800
Somebody from a top-secret, not to
mention illegal, NID operation called 911?

01:15.880 --> 01:18.320
It got real ugly. Come on.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.560
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from the cleaning staff.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.640
The call was cut short.

01:28.760 --> 01:34.360
We've counted 32 casualties, which
includes a six-man security contingent.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.960
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?

01:38.040 --> 01:40.120
We know who did it. As for why...

01:40.200 --> 01:42.960
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.640
Open it.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.360
It was her.

03:21.120 --> 03:26.200
At first we thought she was a survivor,
and then we found this.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.440
We found her in a corner. She seemed
terrified, no memory of what happened.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.600
- You put her in the cell?
- She said that's where they kept her.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.720
We locked her up
after we found the security tapes.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.640
- Who is she?
- We're not sure yet. She's been printed.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.440
- I'm running her through the system.
- Other survivors?

03:55.520 --> 03:59.760
A scientist, Keffler. We're holding him
upstairs. He hasn't been very talkative.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.320
Come on, let me show you
why I called you guys down here.

04:20.519 --> 04:23.080
Wow.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.520
Recognise anything?

04:25.600 --> 04:28.280
Nothing I've catalogued
as coming through the SGC.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.560
- This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
- Who was that?

04:34.640 --> 04:37.600
A Goa'uld
who at one time was loyal to Ra.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.760
She was a powerful ally of his.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.600
He would dispatch her
to rule planets in his stead.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.760
Quell rebellions, oversee executions.
All the fun stuff.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.840
What happened to her?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.520
She was exiled for plotting against Ra.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.520
We also believe she lived here
for most of his dynasty.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.840
I didn't realise this had been recovered.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.600
- It may have come from the Germans.
- The Germans?

04:59.680 --> 05:03.680
The background on Keffler says
that he's the son of a Nazi war criminal.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.160
- We shouldn't be that surprised.
- Rogue NID have no limits, do they?

05:10.640 --> 05:14.520
See if there's anything else
you can tell me about this stuff.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.440
I'm going to go back at Keffler again.
Want to join me?

05:18.520 --> 05:20.120
Sure.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.440
Thought you might want to watch
a master of interrogation at work.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.640
You call in someone special?

05:32.880 --> 05:36.600
Dr Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.640
Of the Stargate programme.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.720
That's right.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.680
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?

05:49.680 --> 05:53.520
Doctor, do I really need to explain
the nature of your situation?

05:53.600 --> 05:56.160
Please do. It amuses me.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.080
This was an off-the-books NID operation,

05:59.160 --> 06:03.840
which means you technically don't exist,
which means no phone calls, no lawyers.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.040
I don't even
have to read you your rights.

06:06.120 --> 06:11.080
To make matters worse for you, the
people behind this operation are all in jail.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.160
Nobody to bail you out.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.080
What kind of work was being done here,
Doctor?

06:18.160 --> 06:22.000
You're a smart girl. You'll figure it out.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.400
Do you think
we'll let you walk away from this?

06:25.480 --> 06:29.360
- 32 people are dead.
- Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.

06:29.440 --> 06:34.040
Some of them were
not quite as incompetent as the others.

06:34.120 --> 06:39.640
Unfortunately the bad ones
always ruin it for everyone, don't they?

06:45.000 --> 06:50.160
- What's this?
- That unlocks my car.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.920
Don't think you're safe.

06:58.680 --> 07:03.560
Read the papers, Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.320
My pills.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.200
Now, now.

07:22.200 --> 07:27.160
You wouldn't want your only witness
to die on you, would you?

07:34.400 --> 07:38.560
It's nitro. Says he has a bad heart. I'd say
an X-ray would confirm a total absence.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.440
- I think he's starting to crack.
- He was colder than Hannibal Lecter.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.760
Still, obviously no match
for a master interrogator.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.840
- You didn't get all Clarice Starling on him.
- I didn't want to step on your toes.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.120
- One more thing to show you.
- There's more?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.720
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.920
- This isn't at all creepy.
- It gets better.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.040
They look like
partially developed foetuses.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.440
They don't look human to me.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.960
- Failed experiments of some kind?
- "What kind?" is the question.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.240
Well, there's one way to find out.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.240
No. Forget it.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.120
We've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.

08:45.200 --> 08:49.600
- I've requested a data retrieval team.
- Present and accounted for.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.680
Right. Of course.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.040
- So, how have you been?
- Busy. You?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.200
Busy.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.000
You know, I never properly thanked you
for that memo on Woolsey.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.400
Maybe we could
go out for dinner sometime.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.560
- I'm seeing someone right now.
- Really? You?

09:13.600 --> 09:17.000
- Hm.
- Well, you asked me out.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.440
Yeah. Right. Sorry.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.880
I'm going to go check in
with Dr Jackson and Teal'c.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.760
Most of the artefacts
are related in some way to Sekhmet.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.960
I'm guessing they were found on Earth,
possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt.

09:36.040 --> 09:42.280
- Nothing of note?
- No, it's interesting stuff, but not really.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.880
- What's this?
- It would appear to be an ark.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.200
Ordained in the gold motif of Ra,
the sun god. Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.680
- What's in it?
- We haven't been able to open it.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.120
But these turn.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.720
- Some sort of combination lock?
- So it would seem.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.320
- Any luck with the scientist?
- No, not exactly.

10:04.400 --> 10:08.520
The girl may be on tape killing everybody,
but I'm sure that guy is not innocent.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.920
What about that girl?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.880
She hasn't said anything
since we locked her up.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.520
I was kind of hoping
that you'd give it a try.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.360
Me?

10:19.440 --> 10:23.040
Heard you got a knack
for this type of thing.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.800
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.120
You're Anna, right?

11:02.440 --> 11:04.920
You know, when I first saw you,

11:06.800 --> 11:11.440
I didn't believe that you could do
the things they said you did.

11:11.520 --> 11:15.240
And even after I saw it for myself,
I still don't believe it.

11:18.560 --> 11:23.800
Look, I know you don't know me
and you have no reason to trust me, but...

11:23.880 --> 11:25.480
I want to help you.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.280
Before I do that,
I need to know a few things first.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.440
I need to know who you are.

11:34.120 --> 11:37.480
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.080
Do you even understand me?

11:43.160 --> 11:47.920
- I didn't kill those people.
- There's some overwhelming evidence.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.160
It wasn't me.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.000
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.720
Turn it off. Turn it off!

12:12.760 --> 12:14.760
Sorry.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.200
I couldn't do those things.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.520
- It looks like you did.
- It's not me.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.120
- Then who is it?
- I don't know.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.360
OK, where were you
when this was happening?

12:33.440 --> 12:36.000
If the person on the tape isn't you,
where were you?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.080
I don't remember.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.640
Who is Dr Keffler?

12:55.840 --> 12:58.000
He is the one who made me.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.800
- She says Keffler made her.
- What does that mean?

13:03.880 --> 13:07.960
- Some sort of genetic research?
- No, she's over 20 years old.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.520
The Asgard can rapidly grow
a human clone, but...

13:10.600 --> 13:14.440
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld
nanite technology from the planet Argos.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.920
It can rapidly grow a human
with the ability to learn very quickly,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.520
and the rogue NID
would have had access to that.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.800
She says Keffler is responsible
for everything that happened.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.280
- How?
- I don't know.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.920
- Do you think she's telling the truth?
- I don't know what to think.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.480
She believes she didn't do it.
Says the girl on the tape isn't her.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.160
How can that be possible?

13:35.240 --> 13:37.640
The NID have cloned
a Goa'uld symbiote before.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.560
- She could be a clone.
- There could be more than one of her.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.240
- How well did you search the facility?
- Top to bottom.

13:43.320 --> 13:47.000
I better put an APB out to local authorities.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.480
Anna, how long have you lived here?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.520
Since I remember.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.960
Yeah? How long is that, exactly?

14:07.040 --> 14:09.280
I don't know.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.800
Have you ever had a birthday?

14:14.640 --> 14:16.440
You know, a birthday.

14:16.520 --> 14:21.920
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin
the tail on the donkey, that kind of thing.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.600
He gave me this paper
and some new charcoal.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.680
Who, Dr Keffler?

14:29.280 --> 14:34.240
He always gave me paper,
but once he said it was my birthday.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.440
Just once?

14:38.880 --> 14:42.240
Have you ever seen anything
outside of this room?

14:42.320 --> 14:44.800
Just pictures.

14:44.880 --> 14:49.440
I've read a lot of books
which describe the world outside.

14:49.520 --> 14:54.040
The mountains, oceans. The sun.

14:54.120 --> 14:58.120
But you've never
experienced them first-hand?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.160
What about these?

15:08.720 --> 15:12.400
Those are the things I see in my dreams.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.000
Flashes.

15:17.080 --> 15:20.800
- They just come to me.
- Do they mean anything to you?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.840
Just that they scare me.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.720
If they scare you so much,
why do you hang them up everywhere?

15:27.800 --> 15:30.360
I don't want them there.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.520
He hurts me if I take them down.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.680
They are important to him.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.880
Do you have any more
with one of those on it? Maybe on an ark?

15:59.280 --> 16:01.560
I got it. It's one of Anna's sketches.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.880
I think it's a combination
to open the ark.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.480
- Did we just do that?
- I do not believe so.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.160
It was activated some time ago.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.320
I got a picture out to local authorities.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.120
If there's a girl that looks like her,
we'll find her.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.920
- I'm in. I have complete access.
- Nice work.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.360
The files seem to document recent work
going back over three years.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.040
Recent work?

16:54.120 --> 16:58.360
The artefacts go back to Napoleon.
The Nazis eventually recovered them.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.920
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.240
They found a Canopic jar.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.680
It's a vessel
containing a preserved symbiote.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.119
Keffler spliced human ovum
with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.800
- She is a human-Goa'uld hybrid.
- Goa'uld pass on knowledge genetically.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.839
They tried to create a human who
could tell them all a Goa'uld would know.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.880
- They didn't want to wait.
- Nanite technology from Area 51.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.960
So they could make her grow up quickly.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.760
It took them 45 failures
before they finally got it right.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.440
- You can call off that APB.
- There's only one of her.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.720
According to this.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.000
The previous attempts
either didn't blend properly

17:38.080 --> 17:40.200
or they grew too fast and died.

17:40.880 --> 17:44.280
The technology had to be modified
so the human could slowly learn

17:44.360 --> 17:49.160
to gain access to the genetic knowledge
buried in her DNA.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.040
My God. They tortured the poor girl.

17:52.920 --> 17:55.160
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.040
- Major Carter. Agent Barrett.
- She's not a clone.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.880
There's only one of her and she's got
Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.400
That could explain her behaviour.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.080
- The ark is a bomb.
- What?

18:08.160 --> 18:11.680
- The ark is a Goa'uld explosive device.
- And it's been activated.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.640
- How much time do we have?
- Approximately 16 hours.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.800
How interesting.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.160
Wipe that smarmy smile off your face
and tell me what's going on here!

18:32.240 --> 18:34.920
- You're hurting me.
- Nothing could make up for what you did.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.680
- Agent Barrett.
- Listen to her, Agent Barrett.

18:37.760 --> 18:42.400
You are gonna tell me everything I want
to know or I'm gonna beat you senseless.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.200
What do you want to know?

18:50.480 --> 18:53.520
For starters,
do you know how to deactivate the bomb?

18:54.160 --> 18:56.240
I didn't know it was a bomb.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.040
So this girl breaks out of her cell,
kills 32 people,

18:59.120 --> 19:01.320
sets a bomb and then sticks around?

19:01.400 --> 19:04.920
- How does that make sense?
- Your problem, Agent Barrett,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.640
one among many, I must point out,
is that you see her as a girl.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.240
If you're gonna give us
moral justification...

19:11.320 --> 19:15.720
Please, Major. I know you have helped to
orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.

19:15.800 --> 19:19.720
Assassinated them in cold blood without
regard for the life of the human host.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.120
- I didn't create the problem.
- Neither did I.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.400
I am merely trying to help solve it.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.120
The Goa'uld
are a terrible threat to us all.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.600
Anna is a conduit to the knowledge
that could level the playing field.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.920
And I think we all agree
that if killing one person

19:36.000 --> 19:39.960
could save millions,
billions of innocent lives,

19:40.040 --> 19:42.560
you would have no choice.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.680
You would do it.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.800
- Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.080
Why set the bomb and stick around?

19:53.120 --> 19:55.240
Anna did not set that bomb.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.040
- Then who did?
- The Goa'uld.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.560
Sekhmet.

20:00.640 --> 20:05.280
But wait a minute. She doesn't have
a snake inside of her, right?

20:05.360 --> 20:08.320
It's something we didn't expect.

20:09.680 --> 20:14.120
A separate and distinct personality.

20:14.920 --> 20:20.240
Anna's mind has created a personality
that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?

20:20.320 --> 20:26.400
Yes, but I don't know if she is incapable
of dealing with the darkness within her,

20:26.480 --> 20:31.840
or if that knowledge is so powerful that
it is capable of manifesting itself as such.

20:31.920 --> 20:36.200
I only know that it emerges
and speaks as a unique entity.

20:36.280 --> 20:40.400
We have witnessed it with a growing
frequency. Anna has no awareness.

20:40.480 --> 20:44.560
To her, it is as if she has blacked out.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.600
The Goa'uld personality comes out,
goes on a rampage, sets the bomb...

20:48.680 --> 20:51.680
But can't stay in control of the body
long enough.

20:51.760 --> 20:55.920
Her breakthroughs are sporadic
and seem somewhat uncontrolled.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.800
- Still, why set the bomb?
- Leverage.

20:58.880 --> 20:59.880
Against what?

20:59.960 --> 21:03.120
Sekhmet has conscious control
of the body for short periods.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.160
She wants more.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.720
She was gonna blackmail you
with the bomb.

21:09.360 --> 21:13.000
The psyche is so simple, isn't it?

21:13.080 --> 21:16.440
So single-minded.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.560
It's truly fascinating to behold.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.400
She thinks
you can give her that full control.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.560
Can you?

21:28.720 --> 21:32.160
She is the experiment.
I am the observer.

21:32.240 --> 21:36.120
The Goa'uld personality didn't
go do something like this on a whim.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.840
You led her to believe that you have
the power to give her control of her life,

21:40.920 --> 21:44.680
and I'll bet you did it so she would
tell you what you want to know.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.400
How to save us all, Major.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.560
I'm not the only one who wants to know.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.720
I don't remember anything.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.880
I know this must be hard for you.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.360
How can you know
what this is like for me?

22:04.440 --> 22:07.880
Cos I knew a boy once
and he was like you.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.480
- There are more like me?
- Not exactly.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.600
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.480
They call a child like that a Harsesis.

22:19.560 --> 22:24.520
- What happened to him?
- He was saved by a very powerful being.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.800
He ascended
to a higher plane of existence

22:27.880 --> 22:30.680
and, when he did,
he gained great power himself.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.920
He used it to show me
that the knowledge and memories

22:34.000 --> 22:38.400
passed on to him by the Goa'uld
genetically came with a terrible burden,

22:39.160 --> 22:43.080
and how it was wrong
to seek it for any reason.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.840
Can I be saved like him?

22:47.880 --> 22:49.480
Maybe.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.760
Honestly, I don't know.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.880
Will you help us shut this bomb off?

22:58.720 --> 23:01.560
- I don't know how.
- You do.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.920
You knew how to open the ark.
It was in your drawings.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.600
I don't remember turning it on.

23:10.680 --> 23:17.480
I know, but somewhere inside your mind
is the answer, and I can help you find it.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.560
<i>(beeping)</i>

23:26.000 --> 23:30.760
According to these readings, there's a
ten-pound block of naqahdah in this thing.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.240
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It would be very bad if it went off.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.800
It's a bomb. Usually
it's not a good thing when they go off.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.280
Can we move this?

23:39.360 --> 23:42.960
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry,
that would be unwise.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.240
It may have a sensor.

23:45.320 --> 23:51.520
Yeah, I don't even want to go there.
Let's... Let's see if we can disarm it here.

23:51.600 --> 23:54.720
I'll get the local authorities
to evacuate the area.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.440
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- How many miles are we talking about?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.440
I don't know. How big is Orange County?

24:05.160 --> 24:07.400
You're kidding, right?

24:07.480 --> 24:10.320
Do I look like a practical joker to you?

24:15.800 --> 24:18.400
Images just come to me.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.520
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.080
Just relax and think about it.

24:25.080 --> 24:28.480
When you look at this,
what comes to mind?

24:29.800 --> 24:33.880
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.880
Do you trust me?

24:37.960 --> 24:40.200
Do you trust me?

24:40.280 --> 24:43.760
I want to help you.
I don't want to hurt you.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.920
After I help you?

24:47.560 --> 24:51.120
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.

24:54.480 --> 24:59.080
- How many birthdays have you had?
- That's not important right now.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.120
You sound just like him.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.600
I heard you were in here.
What are you doing?

25:13.680 --> 25:16.280
I noticed most of the tapes
were labelled "Anna".

25:16.360 --> 25:20.280
It's not just security footage.
It's documentation of the research.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.880
- Anything useful?
- No.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.960
Just something she said when we were
talking, that I reminded her of Keffler.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.320
Figured I needed to learn
about how he dealt with her.

25:30.400 --> 25:34.880
What are the chances you'll find out how
to deactivate the bomb from her in time?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.560
I don't know.

25:36.640 --> 25:40.840
We're trying to evacuate the area.
We don't know how big the blast will be.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.720
No pressure. I'll leave now.

25:52.680 --> 25:56.120
I'd feel better if you were down there
working on the bomb.

25:56.200 --> 26:00.760
Dr Lee is the best we've got and Teal'c
knows more about Goa'uld weapons.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.840
I wanted to see if there was anything more
in the research notes that might help.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.120
Like what?

26:06.200 --> 26:11.320
If we can offer Anna a cure for her
condition, she might be willing to help us.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.440
She's been horribly mistreated

26:13.520 --> 26:16.640
and without intervention
she'd have little hope of survival.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.560
At the time they made her, they had
no idea what her life span was gonna be.

26:20.640 --> 26:25.600
Based on her current rate of growth, l
estimate it can't be more than three years.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.720
- Can you help her?
- Possibly.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.040
We should be able to halt
the rapid-growth effects of the nanites.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.760
I doubt we can unmarry
the Goa'uld DNA from hers,

26:35.840 --> 26:39.040
but we may be able to block
the knowledge from her conscious mind.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.200
Stop it from possessing her.

26:41.280 --> 26:44.360
We've had some luck with certain drugs
in similar situations.

26:44.440 --> 26:50.640
I suppose the fact that you've had similar
situations shouldn't come as a shock.

26:50.720 --> 26:53.880
- Anything on your end?
- Keffler. He wants to chat.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.400
<i>(Anna screams)</i>

27:16.480 --> 27:18.480
<i>There is a cure, Anna.</i>

27:18.560 --> 27:21.840
<i>You can be a normal girl,
live a normal life.</i>

27:21.920 --> 27:25.320
<i>You can be free,
or you can continue to suffer.</i>

27:25.400 --> 27:26.400
<i>(screams)</i>

27:26.480 --> 27:30.640
<i>I don't know anything. Please stop.</i>

27:33.600 --> 27:37.360
<i>- (Sekhmet) Stop this at once.
- Now we're getting somewhere.</i>

27:37.440 --> 27:41.360
<i>- Let me out of here.
- In due time, freedom can be yours.</i>

27:41.960 --> 27:45.120
<i>Do you think I will just tell you
the secrets of the Goa'uld?</i>

27:45.200 --> 27:48.800
<i>- If you want to live.
- You will not kill me.</i>

27:48.880 --> 27:51.440
<i>I can make another
as easily as I made you.</i>

27:51.520 --> 27:54.800
<i>If it were up to me, given the chance</i>

27:54.880 --> 27:59.160
<i>I would rip the beating heart
from your chest and feed it to you.</i>

28:00.080 --> 28:02.280
<i>Such colourful language.</i>

28:02.360 --> 28:05.040
<i>Let's focus on the issue at hand,
shall we?</i>

28:07.760 --> 28:09.760
Son of a bitch.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.400
We have the same goal.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.280
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.640
Look... I know her.

28:20.720 --> 28:24.480
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.560
Yeah, I've read about your methods.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.440
I will only talk to her.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.000
You are welcome to be present
the entire time.

28:34.080 --> 28:38.120
What do you want? I can't believe you'd
be doing this solely for the greater good.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.320
My freedom.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.680
Not a chance.

28:43.760 --> 28:47.800
I am guilty of nothing more
than trying to save this world.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.040
Just like you. We are at war.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.520
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.680
I've heard that defence.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.440
What choice do you have?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.960
How many people will die
if that bomb goes off?

29:03.600 --> 29:07.160
Let's consider this. Do you have
the authority to offer him immunity?

29:07.240 --> 29:12.200
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do,
no court is ever gonna hear about this.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.840
Daniel?

29:17.880 --> 29:21.400
- You let her out, didn't you?
- You must be Daniel Jackson.

29:21.480 --> 29:22.880
What's going on?

29:22.960 --> 29:26.200
He can control when the Goa'uld
comes out. It's not just random.

29:26.280 --> 29:31.400
- He's got himself a little remote control.
- This?

29:31.480 --> 29:34.400
Yeah. He uses it to shock her.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.960
He can make the Goa'uld personality
appear, or kill her with it.

29:38.040 --> 29:42.200
Why? Other scientists gonna shut down
your research, report your experiment?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.680
You have no proof.

29:43.760 --> 29:47.800
You brought out the Goa'uld personality,
then let her out. You murdered 32 people.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.040
Speculation.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.440
You can control her with that.

29:52.520 --> 29:55.920
If you didn't want the scientists dead,
why didn't you stop her?

30:13.040 --> 30:15.040
Careful.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.600
OK.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.000
Just because
the cover wasn't booby-trapped

30:21.080 --> 30:24.200
doesn't mean the crystals themselves
are safe to touch.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.280
That is correct.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.960
There's no energy signatures.

30:30.040 --> 30:34.440
I don't think there's any force fields
or sensors protecting the compartment.

30:34.520 --> 30:38.240
I am unsure which of these crystals
would control detonation.

30:38.320 --> 30:42.400
- Blue is typically for power regulation.
- Indeed.

30:42.480 --> 30:45.560
If we remove the power regulation
for the control board...

30:45.640 --> 30:47.560
The device could explode.

30:51.480 --> 30:55.120
Yeah. I suppose. It's not like
I was gonna pull the yellow one.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.400
Obviously letting Keffler
anywhere near the girl is out.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.320
And if we're gonna get
the bomb deactivation code from Anna,

31:04.400 --> 31:06.400
you're gonna have to do it.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Right.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.800
This red crystal
seems to control the timer.

31:19.880 --> 31:26.680
Now, I should be able to interface with it
and hopefully reprogram it.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.120
<i>- (whirring)
- Anything happening?</i>

31:34.200 --> 31:37.720
- The countdown is increasing in speed.
- What?

31:37.800 --> 31:39.800
Did that stop it?

31:42.080 --> 31:45.400
- Yes. However...
- Hey, how's it coming?

31:46.120 --> 31:48.280
Not well, I take it?

31:48.360 --> 31:51.800
- No, we just had a little setback.
- What?

31:52.280 --> 31:55.200
I was trying to interface
with a control crystal...

31:55.280 --> 31:59.880
The time until detonation
is now less than two hours.

31:59.960 --> 32:04.680
OK. Let's hope that Dr Jackson
is having better luck.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.960
They're trying to evacuate people,

32:12.040 --> 32:17.040
but if that bomb goes off,
people are still gonna die.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.920
Including us?

32:19.000 --> 32:23.760
We have a helicopter standing by to get us
to a safe distance if it comes to that.

32:23.840 --> 32:28.680
I'm hoping it doesn't, because
a lot of others won't have that luxury.

32:28.760 --> 32:32.040
I've been trying. I can't see anything.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.800
You know, not so long ago,
I had my memories erased.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.520
How?

32:42.600 --> 32:48.240
It's a long story, but I was able to access
certain lost memories by meditating.

32:48.320 --> 32:52.200
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
I think that can help you.

32:52.280 --> 32:56.120
What I see scares me so much.

32:56.200 --> 32:59.840
I know. And for good reason.

33:01.160 --> 33:05.120
Ultimately it's up to you.
I can't force you to do this and I won't.

33:05.200 --> 33:09.040
And I promise, either way
we're gonna try and help you,

33:09.120 --> 33:11.120
make it so you can live a normal life.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.800
He always said he could do that.

33:19.400 --> 33:22.760
The truth is, I'm not sure if we can,

33:22.840 --> 33:26.240
but we're going to try
anything and everything in our power.

33:26.320 --> 33:31.280
OK, good. 42 minutes 15 seconds
and counting. I'll check back. Thanks.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.960
We've got ten blocks in each direction
evacuated.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.080
- That's nowhere near enough.
- I know.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.320
I finished going through the files
on the computer.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.760
Even if we halt
the nanites' rapid-growth effect,

33:41.840 --> 33:45.080
you didn't isolate the gene
with the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.160
We didn't have time
to sequence the entire strand.

33:48.240 --> 33:52.960
The goal was to get the intelligence,
not to create a viable living organism.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.640
- I don't understand.
- The way he blended the DNA.

33:56.720 --> 34:00.080
There's nothing we can do
to stop the Goa'uld DNA taking over.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.880
It will overwrite the human
and nothing I know of will stop it.

34:03.960 --> 34:07.880
- What's going to happen to her?
- She'll die. A horrible, painful death.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.000
There's no cure, no way to save her.
That was just another lie.

34:11.080 --> 34:15.360
I placed a capsule of biotoxin
at the base of her brain.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.600
The remote device will activate it.

34:17.679 --> 34:22.719
I did this to prevent any undue suffering
when the time came.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.679
How humane of you.

34:29.800 --> 34:35.320
- What do I do?
- Just relax and try thinking of nothing.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.760
Nothing?

34:38.840 --> 34:41.000
Try an empty room.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.520
You see a doorway.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.679
Go to that door and open it.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.520
Go through.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.840
You're inside of a stone room.

34:58.840 --> 35:02.600
The floor is made of polished marble.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.000
You're inside of a great pyramid.

35:05.080 --> 35:09.400
Ornate carvings of giant snakes
flank a beautiful golden throne.

35:09.480 --> 35:13.120
You see a window
and you walk towards it.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.800
Outside there are thousands of people.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.480
Slaves who worship you as a god.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.520
You have great power over them.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.240
The power to decide
who lives and who dies.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.760
No!

35:29.960 --> 35:32.880
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna!

35:44.600 --> 35:46.600
Anna, stop!

35:59.800 --> 36:01.400
No!

36:04.720 --> 36:06.240
Fire!

36:06.320 --> 36:08.880
Fire! Hurry! Come on!

36:11.800 --> 36:14.200
Hurry!

36:30.880 --> 36:32.880
Daniel. You OK?

36:32.960 --> 36:36.400
- Where is she?
- She won't get far.

36:36.480 --> 36:41.800
This is Agent Barrett. The female prisoner
is unaccounted for. Secure all exits.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.800
<i>Secure entire perimeter
and begin a full sweep.</i>

36:44.880 --> 36:48.600
<i>Target is armed and dangerous.
Use extreme caution.</i>

37:06.560 --> 37:08.280
Ugh!

37:25.520 --> 37:29.240
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.320
Daniel!

37:43.560 --> 37:47.640
I just, uh... need a drink of water.

37:48.640 --> 37:51.360
Please, I'm...

37:51.440 --> 37:54.920
I'm not feeling one hundred per cent.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.640
Agh... My pills.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.800
Ugh!

38:08.480 --> 38:11.480
I think it's the deactivation code.

38:18.080 --> 38:22.840
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter.
Come in. What's your location?

38:22.920 --> 38:24.920
Agent Barrett?

38:40.600 --> 38:43.440
This is Carter.
Agent Barrett needs medical attention.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.600
We are in the northeast corridor,
level one.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.480
That's it. It's off.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.880
I mean, the lights turned off.
That means it's off, right?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.960
Indeed.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.560
Well, hey...

39:27.680 --> 39:29.800
Drop the gun.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.760
- Anna...
- Drop it!

39:41.960 --> 39:47.040
Come with me... now... to the lab.

39:48.240 --> 39:52.200
- I will help you.
- You can't help me.

39:53.320 --> 39:57.360
- Whatever they've told you...
- It doesn't matter.

39:57.440 --> 40:00.000
I never believed you.

40:00.080 --> 40:04.480
Anna, I did it to help people.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.880
All the evil I have seen in my mind,

40:09.040 --> 40:14.400
nothing you put inside me
compares to what I see in you.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.200
<i>(running footsteps)</i>

40:18.280 --> 40:20.160
<i>(machine-gun fire)</i>

40:20.240 --> 40:22.240
Anna!

40:33.680 --> 40:35.680
What did you do?

40:38.840 --> 40:41.000
You couldn't help me.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.120
I'm so sorry.

40:44.305 --> 40:50.288
