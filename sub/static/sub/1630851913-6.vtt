a live one this morning.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.030
I've got him in back.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.784
Arellanos got rich kids crossing coke now.

17:16.785 --> 17:20.456
Customs sees him driving a nice car?
Waves him right through.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.917
[Walt] Well, how much was he holding?

17:24.001 --> 17:27.796
No powder. But he had 14,000 in cash,
a 9mm in the glovebox.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.549
-That's something.
-It's his brother that's interesting.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.594
Who is his brother?

17:34.261 --> 17:36.555
Right-hand dipshit to Ramón Arellano.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.807
Kid gets us his brother,
his brother gets us Ramón.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.434
Now you're catching up. Come on.

17:43.854 --> 17:47.024
[door opens and closes]

17:47.858 --> 17:48.692
[Walt] Good morning.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.444
You speak English?

17:50.527 --> 17:52.112
Do you speak Spanish?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.030
[Walt] Smart.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.532
You're in a lot
of fucking trouble here, Alex.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.077
-[paper rustles]
-Fourteen thousand in cash?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.411
Parents gave it to me.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.706
It's my allowance.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.167
That 9mm. Mom give you that, too?

18:06.335 --> 18:07.628
The serial number's filed off.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.880
Which means you're fucked, Alex.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.550
We got this thing up here
called minimum sentencing guidelines.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.930
File the serial number on a firearm,
it's five years federal time.

18:19.890 --> 18:20.808
He's right, Alex.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.895
Or we can forget this even happened.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.523
You help us out, cooperate…

18:28.107 --> 18:30.359
I imagine you know
something about the Arellanos.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.693
Felipe Ruiz.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.906
The car is registered in his name.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.787
He works for my dad and he
lent me his car. Mine is in the shop.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.916
Where did you say you found that gun?

18:47.835 --> 18:48.961
[in Spanish] In the glovebox?

18:49.044 --> 18:50.420
[intense music playing]

18:50.504 --> 18:52.631
[in English] Sorry,
how do you say that in English?

18:54.049 --> 18:56.760
-Glovebox.
-Glovebox.

18:57.886 --> 18:58.762
Well…

19:00.305 --> 19:03.183
Wish I knew something
so dangerous was in the glovebox.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.395
Guess it was locked.

19:07.938 --> 19:11.984
Sometimes I watch
this TV show, <i>Law &amp; Order.</i>

19:14.069 --> 19:16.780
You know what else they talk about
besides minimum sentencing?

19:16.864 --> 19:18.532
I have no idea.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.160
Warrants.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.496
Like how you need one.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.422
I'm also pretty sure
this isn't the police station.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.591
So, what is this?

19:37.885 --> 19:40.220
You might want to let me go
before I call my lawyer.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.641
[Jack breathing heavily]

19:46.393 --> 19:47.352
[Walt] All right, Alex.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.814
If you wake up one day and realize

19:50.898 --> 19:54.193
the amount of shit
that you're caught up in, call me.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.449
[Jack] Kid's smarter than he looks.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.367
You know, I could hold him
for another 12 hours.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.036
[door closes]

20:04.661 --> 20:07.331
Nah, cut him loose.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.248
[Jack] You sure?

20:08.332 --> 20:11.043
[clears throat] Yep, call him a cab.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.295
[Enedina] <i>Cali's walking away…</i>

20:14.296 --> 20:16.131
<i>That's bad for both of us, Amado.</i>

20:17.716 --> 20:18.926
I'm listening.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.679
We use it as an opportunity…

20:22.763 --> 20:24.932
<i>find a new supplier.</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:30.771
Negotiate as one, drive the price down.

20:33.565 --> 20:37.611
My family's willing to look past
the Cali deal you made without us.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.491
Heard Benjamín's taking some time away.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.910
Temporary.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.038
You interested?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.834
Is this what your brothers want?

20:54.795 --> 20:56.129
It's what we all want.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.674
<i>You talking to FARC?</i>

20:58.757 --> 21:00.008
[dramatic music playing]

21:00.092 --> 21:02.386
Working on it. You?

21:03.220 --> 21:05.514
Waiting to hear back
from the North Valley.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.141
<i>Henao's hard to pin down.</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:10.018
Any luck?

21:12.771 --> 21:15.524
We won't need luck if we play this right.

21:16.650 --> 21:17.943
I'll think about it.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.278
We'll keep in touch.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.612
[cell phone beeps]

21:32.874 --> 21:33.917
We're ready to go.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.475
[people clamoring]

22:02.195 --> 22:04.197
[car radio playing indistinctly]

22:44.112 --> 22:45.030
[in Spanish] Andréa Nuñez,

22:45.113 --> 22:47.365
I've left three messages. [sighs]

22:47.449 --> 22:48.533
Bye.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.121
[Isaac in Spanish] Andréa,

22:53.997 --> 22:55.832
don't you have that thing?
The Colosio rally?

22:55.916 --> 22:56.958
No.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.044
[dramatic music playing]

23:00.128 --> 23:01.046
Thanks.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.720
[news announcer in Spanish]
<i>We have a breaking news bulletin.</i>

23:08.804 --> 23:12.974
<i>Police have confirmed</i>
<i>that shortly after concluding a speech,</i>

23:13.058 --> 23:16.186
<i>Luis Donaldo Colosio,</i>
<i>PRI candidate for president,</i>

23:16.269 --> 23:18.688
<i>was shot at a campaign rally</i>
<i>outside Tijuana…</i>

23:18.772 --> 23:22.400
[Isabella] <i>Everyone has a different</i>
<i>memory of what happened that day.</i>

23:22.484 --> 23:25.821
<i>But on March 23rd, 1994,</i>
<i>Luis Donaldo Colosio</i>

23:25.904 --> 23:29.074
<i>was assassinated</i>
<i>at a campaign rally in Tijuana.</i>

23:29.157 --> 23:32.494
<i>Questions of who killed him</i>
<i>and why would linger.</i>

23:32.577 --> 23:34.746
<i>Mexico's own version of JFK.</i>

23:34.830 --> 23:37.666
While in Mexico today, shock and outrage

23:37.749 --> 23:39.334
over the assassination of the man widely

23:39.417 --> 23:42.212
expected to become
the country's next president.

23:42.295 --> 23:46.174
[in Spanish] A special prosecutor
has been assigned

23:46.258 --> 23:48.927
to lead an investigation of this crime.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.179
[Isabella] <i>We were used to being lied to,</i>

23:51.263 --> 23:54.391
<i>but the death of a presidential</i>
<i>candidate made the lies bigger.</i>

23:54.474 --> 23:55.976
<i>More dangerous.</i>

23:56.059 --> 23:58.186
<i>That disconnect between us and the truth,</i>

23:58.270 --> 24:01.982
<i>no matter what you thought</i>
<i>of Colosio as a politician,</i>

24:02.065 --> 24:04.151
<i>would shape everything that came after.</i>

24:04.234 --> 24:05.277
[reporter 1 in Spanish] Diana Laura!

24:05.360 --> 24:06.528
How are you, Diana Laura?

24:06.611 --> 24:08.321
-[in Spanish] Make way, please.
-[reporter 2] Who is the killer?

24:08.405 --> 24:10.115
-[reporter 1] Diana Laura!
-[reporter 2] Who's the killer?

24:10.198 --> 24:11.408
[reporter 1] Who had him killed?

24:11.491 --> 24:13.493
[reporters clamoring]

24:30.677 --> 24:32.179
[Karen in Spanish]
You're from "La Voz," right?

24:34.181 --> 24:35.682
Please, not right now.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.938
Can I borrow your lighter?

24:58.246 --> 24:59.664
Trying to quit.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.669
Me, too.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.557
[indistinct chatter]

25:30.820 --> 25:32.030
I'm sorry.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.416
They killed him.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.587
He was going to change things.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.509
So they fucking murdered him.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.847
Who did?

26:00.809 --> 26:02.227
The PRI wanted him dead.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.813
[Salgado] A lot of people did, Andréa.

26:05.647 --> 26:08.483
No one had more reason
than the party's old guard.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.156
He threatened everything they built.

26:17.867 --> 26:18.785
Come.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.372
Hank Gonzalez?

26:24.207 --> 26:27.085
Where are you on his casino,
the money-laundering story?

26:27.168 --> 26:28.336
Nothing.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.754
No one'll talk.

26:30.797 --> 26:36.344
Same with the plane being held, Taesa.
They're both dead ends.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.264
We can't get within
ten steps of this fucking guy.

26:40.974 --> 26:41.933
They're all lying!

26:42.767 --> 26:44.436
Of course they're lying, Andréa.

26:45.895 --> 26:48.732
-Colosio. You have any proof?
-Not yet.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.569
Secret Service led him through the crowd,

26:52.652 --> 26:55.113
but no one notified
his team of the change.

26:55.196 --> 26:57.615
This woman you spoke to…

26:57.699 --> 26:59.784
Karen. Karen Rodríguez,
his political aide.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.161
She willing to go on the record?

27:03.705 --> 27:05.332
I need more time.

27:06.791 --> 27:10.170
What you know is true doesn't matter,
only what you can prove.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.089
See where it goes.

27:13.673 --> 27:14.591
Carefully.

28:02.138 --> 28:03.681
No fuckin' way.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.903
[line ringing]

28:16.986 --> 28:18.154
[man in Spanish] <i>Special unit.</i>

28:18.238 --> 28:19.447
This is Breslin.

28:19.531 --> 28:23.868

I got eyes on a kid named Alfredo Padova.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.328
One of Ramón's guys.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.207
[Victor] Good afternoon, Mrs. Barragan.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.210
You see…

28:33.086 --> 28:34.587
Apparently there's…

28:35.213 --> 28:37.424
a body that fits the…

28:38.091 --> 28:39.426
description…

28:41.136 --> 28:42.512
And…

28:43.138 --> 28:44.264

29:05.702 --> 29:06.911
[Mrs. Barragan in Spanish] No. Please.

29:07.495 --> 29:08.329
No.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.128
No, God, it can't be.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.800
No! Not my little girl.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.345
No! Please…

29:25.638 --> 29:27.140
God, no…

29:27.223 --> 29:29.559
Please. No, no, no…

29:29.642 --> 29:32.604
Not my baby girl…

29:37.734 --> 29:39.736
[sighs] There was blood…

29:40.862 --> 29:41.946
under her nails.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.990
Yeah.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.325
She fought.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.496
Scratched up
whoever killed her pretty good.

29:50.413 --> 29:51.831
You do something with it?

29:53.875 --> 29:58.797
The blood. There's tests
and shit for that. DNA, whatever.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.175
DNA?

30:04.594 --> 30:06.429
What do you think this is?

30:07.180 --> 30:09.766
Gotta go to the other side for that shit.
Across the river.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.578
Thank you, beautiful.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.833
But local attractions
do have their appeal.

30:36.334 --> 30:40.505
So, I heard they gave you a new name.

30:41.297 --> 30:42.715
"Lord of the Heavens."

30:43.758 --> 30:45.343
[sighs] "Skies."

30:45.969 --> 30:47.637
Only one Lord.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.808
The Rodríguez brothers want to retire.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.144
Take it that doesn't sit well with you.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.230
Rumors.

30:57.897 --> 31:01.734
Rumors or not. I need product.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.821
Four tons a week.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.990
Can the North Valley
put together that kind of package?

31:07.740 --> 31:09.826
Sure we could arrange something.

31:10.493 --> 31:13.621
Same terms I had with Cali. Nonnegotiable.

31:15.665 --> 31:19.377
I'm meeting the FARC this afternoon,
Bolivians after that.

31:20.753 --> 31:24.173
If you aren't interested in getting rich,
I'm sure they will be.

31:25.258 --> 31:28.052
No need to look elsewhere.

31:29.137 --> 31:32.891
The North Valley would be
happy to accommodate you.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.684
This arrangement… it's <i>exclusive.</i>

31:35.476 --> 31:37.353
You only supply me.

31:38.646 --> 31:39.480
Understood?

31:40.189 --> 31:41.357
I see…

31:42.275 --> 31:44.861
Plan on starving the Arellanos?

31:44.944 --> 31:46.613
They've reached out to me.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.699

33:01.896 --> 33:03.898
[clicks tongue] Not long.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.283

come through town once a year.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.201

My father.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.057
-Your father?
-Hmm.

33:38.141 --> 33:42.895
Taught me guitar, piano… everything.
