00:09.983 --> 00:11.755
Previously on "Greenleaf"...

00:11.757 --> 00:13.666
Why didn't you tell me we have a son?

00:13.690 --> 00:15.366
I knew if you knew that I was pregnant,

00:15.390 --> 00:17.300
you'd want to keep it.

00:17.324 --> 00:19.532
Bishop, I could get into a lot of trouble

00:19.556 --> 00:20.800
for putting that out for you,

00:20.824 --> 00:22.555
so you can't tell anyone
where you got it.

00:22.557 --> 00:25.155
This is not the way that we're
gonna win back this church,

00:25.157 --> 00:27.788
not by blaming and shaming.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.788
By my will.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.921
I know the team is giving
you a little stipend,

00:32.923 --> 00:34.421
but I figure a little something extra

00:34.423 --> 00:35.700
couldn't hurt your pockets.

00:35.724 --> 00:37.532
And I can't have you reporting
back to management

00:37.556 --> 00:40.155
every time I feel like blowing
ten racks up in the club.

00:40.157 --> 00:42.532
If you were to be my, say,

00:42.556 --> 00:44.600
eyes and ears among the greenleafs,

00:44.624 --> 00:46.622
I'd definitely make you A.P.

00:46.624 --> 00:48.521
Are you asking me to spy?

00:48.523 --> 00:50.166
You like it?

00:50.190 --> 00:51.799
Where would we get
the money to pay for this?

00:51.823 --> 00:52.933
We can sell the land.

00:52.957 --> 00:54.533
I don't want to sell it.

00:54.557 --> 00:57.090
Jacob, I want out of this house.

00:57.857 --> 00:59.133
Hello?

00:59.157 --> 01:01.048
Hi. This is A.J.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.421
Are you there?

01:03.423 --> 01:05.421
Yeah, A.J.

01:05.423 --> 01:07.933
So are you gonna help me out or what?

01:07.957 --> 01:10.355
Yeah, I can help.

01:49.357 --> 01:50.932
Yeah?

01:50.956 --> 01:53.555
Uh, hi. My name is Grace Greenleaf,

01:53.557 --> 01:55.288
I'm here to see A.J. Dellahay.

01:55.290 --> 01:56.821
I'm...

01:56.823 --> 01:57.799
I'm his mother.

01:57.823 --> 02:00.300
Visiting hours end at 5:00.

02:00.324 --> 02:02.032
I know. My flight was delayed.

02:02.056 --> 02:04.022
Is he expecting you?

02:10.556 --> 02:13.222
Your, um, mother's here to see you.

02:15.224 --> 02:17.090
He'll be down in a sec,

02:18.156 --> 02:19.488
you can wait out there.

02:21.424 --> 02:23.048
Thank you.

02:47.023 --> 02:48.673
What are you doing here?

02:49.357 --> 02:50.566
I wanted to see you.

02:50.590 --> 02:52.055
I thought you were just
gonna send the money.

02:52.057 --> 02:53.622
That was the deal.

02:56.024 --> 02:57.631
Hi.

02:58.890 --> 03:02.732
Yeah, I know this must be real
emotional for you right now.

03:02.756 --> 03:05.732
But I'm not your science experiment.

03:05.756 --> 03:07.500
You can't leave me
in a drawer my whole life

03:07.524 --> 03:09.100
and then take me out whenever you want

03:09.124 --> 03:10.632
and have all the feels.

03:10.656 --> 03:12.688
I'm sorry. This is just...

03:12.690 --> 03:15.732
this is really hard seeing you.

03:15.756 --> 03:17.965
- Not to...
- all I want from you...

03:19.056 --> 03:21.166
Is some cash to get on my feet,

03:21.190 --> 03:22.899
unless you're here to deliver a check,

03:22.923 --> 03:24.590
then get out of here.

03:26.390 --> 03:27.988
Can we just sit and talk for a minute?

03:27.990 --> 03:29.099
There's nothing else to say!

03:29.123 --> 03:30.632
There are things I want to say.

03:30.656 --> 03:31.923
Listen...

03:32.590 --> 03:35.099
You didn't want me when you had me.

03:35.123 --> 03:37.166
You didn't want me
when I came looking for you

03:37.190 --> 03:38.721
the first time.

03:38.723 --> 03:40.088
You don't get to have me now

03:40.090 --> 03:42.988
just to make yourself feel better.

03:45.190 --> 03:46.366
It's not that I didn't want you.

03:46.390 --> 03:47.954
Just give me the money or go!

03:47.956 --> 03:50.000
I don't want to just hand you some money

03:50.024 --> 03:51.933
and watch you disappear back into the...

03:51.957 --> 03:55.466
back into the dark where you
used to wish I'd stay in?

03:55.490 --> 03:56.821
Oh.

03:56.823 --> 03:59.399
Too bad.

03:59.423 --> 04:01.555
Are you gonna help me out or not?

04:05.723 --> 04:07.621
Don't let her in here again.

04:12.423 --> 04:14.332

05:15.657 --> 05:16.933
Where's Gigi?

05:16.957 --> 05:19.332
I saw Maricel and her crew up there,

05:19.356 --> 05:20.599
deep cleaning.

05:20.623 --> 05:22.066
Well, she took a flight to Phoenix

05:22.090 --> 05:23.755
to hash out some things with Ray.

05:23.757 --> 05:27.106
Well, I am out of here, to pay for this.

05:28.923 --> 05:30.673
I'll see you.

05:31.224 --> 05:33.221
James?

05:33.223 --> 05:34.599
A moment, if you will.

05:34.623 --> 05:35.755
Oh, please.

05:35.757 --> 05:39.466
I'll take any excuse
to avoid that rowing machine.

05:39.490 --> 05:41.000
The Lord gave me a dream.

05:41.024 --> 05:43.322
Wow. That... that's exciting.

05:43.324 --> 05:45.673
I was walking in a museum,

05:46.324 --> 05:49.588
and then there was screams,
and the guard ran out.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.922
I followed behind him into this gallery

05:51.924 --> 05:55.066
where people were standing
in front of this painting

05:55.090 --> 05:58.888
that had been ripped
right down the middle...

05:58.890 --> 06:02.090
a painting of Christ.

06:02.923 --> 06:05.366
You were standing next to it

06:05.390 --> 06:08.855
with a knife with blood on the blade.

06:08.857 --> 06:10.032
Me?

06:10.056 --> 06:11.700
And then you dropped the blade,

06:11.724 --> 06:14.422
you looked at your hands,
and then you looked at me.

06:17.890 --> 06:19.881
And you said you were sorry.

06:21.357 --> 06:23.155
And then I woke up.

06:23.157 --> 06:25.965
And what do you think that means?

06:26.890 --> 06:29.840
You have to apologize, James.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.688
To who, for what?

06:31.690 --> 06:33.866
To the church, for everything.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.033
You want to talk about that again?

06:35.057 --> 06:37.732
I am convinced more than ever

06:37.756 --> 06:39.799
that the key to getting this church back

06:39.823 --> 06:43.355
is as much in your hands
as it is Grace's.

06:43.357 --> 06:46.921
I'll tell you what...
if the Lord gives me a dream

06:46.923 --> 06:49.400
I'll, uh... I'll give that some thought,

06:49.424 --> 06:52.199
but until such a time as that happens,

06:52.223 --> 06:55.621
I'm gonna tell you
like Reuben told Joseph...

06:55.623 --> 06:58.555
keep your dreams to yourself.

07:02.757 --> 07:04.588
At 1:00 you have the new members,

07:04.590 --> 07:07.666
2:30 ushers, and your
meeting with Dante at 4:00.

07:07.690 --> 07:09.821
At 4:00.

07:09.823 --> 07:11.132
Can you remind him?

07:11.156 --> 07:14.055
'Cause time and that boy
have a complex relationship.

07:14.057 --> 07:16.788
- I'll text him right now.
- Thank you.

07:16.790 --> 07:18.421
Good morning, Mrs. Greenleaf.

07:18.423 --> 07:19.666
Good morning.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.133
We're so thrilled to
have Pastor Jacob back.

07:21.157 --> 07:22.754
Oh, it's wonderful, isn't it?

07:22.756 --> 07:24.755
Yes, ma'am.

07:24.757 --> 07:26.732
She's sweet. Hey, baby.

07:26.756 --> 07:29.666
- Mwah!
- Why aren't you at work?

07:29.690 --> 07:34.122
Someone wants to buy the land.

07:34.124 --> 07:35.699
The land I don't want to sell?

07:35.723 --> 07:37.633
You asked for a week to pray about it.

07:37.657 --> 07:38.921
That week ended yesterday.

07:38.923 --> 07:40.522
So you just put the land on the market

07:40.524 --> 07:42.054
without even asking me first?

07:42.056 --> 07:45.288
No, no, I just asked Nadine
to put out some feelers.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.755
And it's my land, too.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.400
Can you please stop saying that?

07:48.424 --> 07:50.133
Well, if you would stop acting
like everything we do

07:50.157 --> 07:52.465
is up to you, yeah.

07:52.957 --> 07:54.355
Who wants to buy it?

07:54.357 --> 07:56.715
A commercial developer.

07:57.357 --> 08:00.466
Don't you want to know
how much they offered?

08:00.490 --> 08:03.221
More than we paid for it!

08:03.223 --> 08:06.866
Ooh! Now, if that is not
an answer to your prayers,

08:06.890 --> 08:10.756
it definitely is an answer to mine.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.800
Mwah!

♪ Come beneath the Shepherd of souls ♪

08:23.357 --> 08:30.600

08:30.624 --> 08:33.600
♪ In Harmony and Hope ♪

08:33.624 --> 08:35.288
I hate this song worse than sin.

08:35.289 --> 08:36.466
Yeah, I do, too.

08:36.490 --> 08:37.698
But apparently they sing it

08:37.722 --> 08:39.765
at every H-and-H church every Sunday.

08:39.789 --> 08:40.799
Ooh! So?

08:40.823 --> 08:42.087
Yeah, yeah.

08:42.090 --> 08:43.332
Mm.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.088
It is, but Judy wants us
to sing it next Sunday.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.488
Bob is coming, and so is she.

08:47.490 --> 08:50.288
But this is the whitest
piece of ear trash

08:50.290 --> 08:51.866
I've ever heard in my life.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.488
I'm just the messenger, Charity.

08:53.490 --> 08:57.088
And what is this part about
"he comforts with his rod"?

08:57.090 --> 08:58.532
Oh, it's from 23rd psalm.

08:58.556 --> 09:02.088
Yeah, but if you put it at
the end of the line like that,

09:02.090 --> 09:03.300
it's questionable.

09:03.324 --> 09:04.300
Hmm.

09:04.324 --> 09:05.499
What's this woman's e-mail?

09:05.523 --> 09:07.332
I'm about to send her
a Charity Greenleaf special.

09:07.356 --> 09:11.266
Um, Grace told me that
I'm to talk to her first

09:11.290 --> 09:13.440
before ever bothering Judy.

09:13.957 --> 09:16.188
Ugh! Don't get me in trouble.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.422
Fine. I'll talk to Grace.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.788
This is a hot mess.

know where Grace is?

09:41.690 --> 09:43.555
Pastor Greenleaf is out of town.

09:43.557 --> 09:45.755
Is there anything I can do to help?

09:45.757 --> 09:48.222
Uh, if Grace is not here, I don't know.

09:48.224 --> 09:50.421
Um, she... ugh.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.666
We had an appointment for tomorrow night,

09:52.690 --> 09:55.199
did she say when she was
planning on returning?

09:55.223 --> 09:56.954
Let me see if I can try her by phone.

09:56.956 --> 09:58.599
Okay.

09:58.623 --> 10:00.355
Mrs. Williams, nice to see you.

10:00.357 --> 10:03.133
Oh. Hello, Pastor Demars.

10:03.157 --> 10:04.755
Is there something wrong?

10:04.757 --> 10:07.021
Uh, no. Yes.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.666
I mean, I'm... I'm not sure.

10:08.690 --> 10:10.932
I wanted to see Pastor Greenleaf.

10:10.956 --> 10:12.255
I was just about to call her.

10:12.257 --> 10:14.366
Well, I don't think
it's necessary to bother her.

10:14.390 --> 10:16.622
- I'm sure she's busy.
- But she said to call...

10:16.624 --> 10:18.133
why don't you join me
in my office, sister?

10:18.157 --> 10:20.421
I'd love to help if I can.

10:20.423 --> 10:23.000
You look like you're in a state.

10:23.024 --> 10:25.488
Yes, I suppose I am.

10:25.490 --> 10:27.466
Hold my calls.

10:27.490 --> 10:29.655
"Hold my calls."

10:32.423 --> 10:35.266
Call Lady Mae home.

10:38.090 --> 10:39.955
Oh.

10:44.490 --> 10:45.522
Hello?

10:45.524 --> 10:47.233
I'm sorry to bother you, Pastor.

10:47.257 --> 10:48.988
Oh, it's no bother.

10:48.990 --> 10:52.055
And, Karine, thank you
so much for persisting

10:52.057 --> 10:53.499
with the title.

10:53.523 --> 10:56.633
Even in this time of exile,
it's deeply appreciated.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.466
Misty Williams just
showed up here very upset

10:59.490 --> 11:00.433
looking for Grace.

11:00.457 --> 11:02.566
- Upset about what?
- She wouldn't say.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.188
She just said that she and Grace

11:04.190 --> 11:05.855
had an appointment tomorrow night,

11:05.857 --> 11:07.521
but there's nothing on her calendar,

11:07.523 --> 11:11.921
and Phil just took her away
and said to hold his calls.

11:11.923 --> 11:13.506
Phil.

11:14.324 --> 11:16.289
Thank you for letting me know.

11:23.290 --> 11:25.200
What time does he have to sign in?

11:25.224 --> 11:27.922
Noon, then 5:00 is curfew.

11:35.156 --> 11:36.421
You came back?

11:36.423 --> 11:37.555
- A.J...
- Go home.

11:37.557 --> 11:38.732
I'll give you the money,

11:38.756 --> 11:40.288
I'm on a plane back to Memphis tonight.

11:40.290 --> 11:42.422
Just give me a chance to explain.

11:45.624 --> 11:46.999
Please.

11:56.556 --> 11:58.332
Who wants to buy it?

11:58.356 --> 12:00.288
Something-something, LLC.

12:00.290 --> 12:02.288
They got a website full of projects.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.421
And what are their plans for it...

12:06.423 --> 12:10.088
that little piece of paradise
you so boldly acquired

12:10.090 --> 12:13.066
in your rage against me and your mother?

12:13.090 --> 12:15.355
I don't know, really,
but, uh, it'll make money.

12:15.357 --> 12:17.888
At least that's what
the realtor tells Kerissa.

12:17.890 --> 12:19.800
It's a good deal.

12:19.824 --> 12:22.155
That's the realtor's job
to tell her that.

12:22.157 --> 12:23.900
Preaching to the choir, pop.

12:23.924 --> 12:26.155
Just tell Kerissa no. Just say no.

12:26.157 --> 12:29.006
Pops, she really wants this house.

12:29.757 --> 12:31.488
Where?

12:31.490 --> 12:33.066
Germantown.

12:33.090 --> 12:35.400
And we have no cash.

12:35.424 --> 12:36.633
You just moved back home.

12:36.657 --> 12:39.166
I know. It's not my idea.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.721
Have you seen this dream home?

12:40.723 --> 12:42.888
No, but I know as soon as I get in there,

12:42.890 --> 12:45.132
I'm just gonna say yes to make her happy,

12:45.156 --> 12:47.355
or at least less mad.

12:51.256 --> 12:52.881
You know what I think?

12:55.224 --> 12:57.821
As foolish as it was to buy that land,

12:57.823 --> 13:00.566
you own it now. It's yours.

13:00.590 --> 13:02.121
And whatever they're willing to pay,

13:02.123 --> 13:05.721
someone else will be willing
to pay more 50 years from now.

13:05.723 --> 13:11.069
Land is the closest thing to
Faith a man can have in this life,

13:11.071 --> 13:14.132
as far as a firm place to stand.

13:14.156 --> 13:16.021
That's how the rich stay rich.

13:16.023 --> 13:17.715
They don't sell.

13:18.623 --> 13:21.732
And as much as you feel like
indulging Kerissa

13:21.756 --> 13:24.088
will bring you peace...

13:24.090 --> 13:25.955
It won't.

13:25.957 --> 13:28.488
Yeah, but it might at least
get me some quiet.

13:28.490 --> 13:31.298
Pop, at this point
I'd... I'd settle for quiet.

13:32.057 --> 13:34.631
She doesn't want that house, Jacob.

13:35.590 --> 13:39.033
She wants to know that
she has a home with you.

13:39.057 --> 13:41.566
She's still stinging
from that three-act farce

13:41.590 --> 13:43.788
you played out with Tasha.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.600
That's all this is about.

13:46.624 --> 13:49.466
It's not about land or houses.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.222
It's not even about the money.

13:54.824 --> 13:58.155
Love her more and let her know.

14:01.956 --> 14:03.988
And don't sell.

14:07.190 --> 14:09.532
I know I didn't do the right thing.

14:09.556 --> 14:13.588
I couldn't figure out how
to put it all together...

14:13.590 --> 14:18.606
you... and me and Sophia.

14:19.557 --> 14:22.554
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

14:22.556 --> 14:24.066
I want to do better.

14:24.090 --> 14:27.099
You think you made the right
decision the first time?

14:27.123 --> 14:28.255
First time?

14:28.257 --> 14:31.006
When you had me and let me go?

14:36.690 --> 14:38.488
I don't know.

14:42.904 --> 14:44.788
You know, whether you're willing
to walk down this road

14:44.790 --> 14:47.840
with me a little or not at all,

14:48.157 --> 14:51.821
you're gonna need someone to
cosign on that apartment, A.J.

14:51.823 --> 14:53.632
Yo, those mine?

14:53.656 --> 14:57.322
I said come in my room
and I'll put hands on you.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.821
Hey, break it up. Break it up!

15:00.823 --> 15:02.755
Break it up!

15:02.757 --> 15:03.866
Move.

15:03.890 --> 15:05.465
Get back!

15:06.824 --> 15:08.699
Could we go check out a place?

15:08.723 --> 15:09.854
You have somewhere in mind?

15:09.856 --> 15:11.921
Yeah, it's got a pool.

15:11.923 --> 15:13.322
Let's go take a look.

15:16.157 --> 15:17.522
Zora?

15:19.423 --> 15:21.266
You here for Low Saints?

15:21.290 --> 15:23.399
No, I'm here for the eye candy.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.732
You know Dante Saunders?

15:24.756 --> 15:27.033
Well, dad's having a meeting
with him here this afternoon.

15:27.057 --> 15:28.955
And Jacob's letting you join?

15:30.123 --> 15:31.532
No.

15:31.556 --> 15:34.333
Actually, he's doing everything
he can to ice me out.

15:34.357 --> 15:37.399
But... I won't have it.

15:37.423 --> 15:40.355
Get yours, girl.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.255
Thank you. I will.

15:44.157 --> 15:45.688
Hey, where's my sister at?

15:45.690 --> 15:46.733
Phoenix.

15:46.757 --> 15:48.021
Phoenix, Arizona?

15:48.023 --> 15:49.421
Yeah, that one.

15:49.423 --> 15:50.855
Visiting Harmony and Hope?

15:50.857 --> 15:52.300
I don't know. She didn't say.

15:52.324 --> 15:53.921
Would you like me to call her?

15:53.923 --> 15:57.233
No, that's okay, um, is Pastor Phil in?

15:57.257 --> 15:59.465
He's meeting with Misty Williams.

16:00.824 --> 16:02.021
Hmm.

16:02.023 --> 16:03.533
Is there something I can help you with?

16:03.557 --> 16:07.000
No. Um, that's all right.

16:07.024 --> 16:08.522
As you were.

16:16.256 --> 16:17.255
Hey.

16:17.257 --> 16:18.600
Where are you off to

16:18.624 --> 16:20.332
looking like the girl I married?

16:20.356 --> 16:22.521
Fred and Misty's.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.700
- Hmm.
- What's the matter?

16:24.724 --> 16:27.233
All I know is Misty
came looking for Grace

16:27.257 --> 16:31.122
and ended up spending two hours
crying with Phil Demars.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.888
What are you doing here?

16:34.890 --> 16:36.955
- Oh, just came to talk to pop.
- Yeah.

16:36.957 --> 16:38.488
Get back to church.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.022
I was just about to, actually.

16:40.024 --> 16:41.622
I'll come with you.

16:41.624 --> 16:43.221
I'll handle it.

16:43.223 --> 16:45.821
Mae, just because I don't
change my whole life

16:45.823 --> 16:47.488
every time you have a dream doesn't mean

16:47.490 --> 16:49.600
I can't be of service in some situations.

16:49.624 --> 16:52.066
Fine. Just don't take long.

16:52.090 --> 16:53.822
I'll just grab my coat.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.588
That's what he says, then it's 15 minutes

16:58.590 --> 17:01.577
and he comes out looking
like Billy Dee Williams.

17:02.841 --> 17:06.555
And ministry is not work
that you can do remotely, son.

17:06.557 --> 17:08.820
Please get back to church.

17:08.823 --> 17:10.422
Yes, ma'am.

17:18.890 --> 17:24.555
So you find the rod to
be a comfort, sister Judy?

17:27.356 --> 17:29.590
Let's see how you like this one.

17:46.090 --> 17:47.840
So, what do you think?

17:48.556 --> 17:50.155
What do you think?

17:50.157 --> 17:52.566
It's your money.

17:52.590 --> 17:54.922
I don't have to live here, though.

18:01.423 --> 18:03.066
You okay?

18:03.090 --> 18:05.199
Yeah, I just...

18:05.223 --> 18:08.455
Haven't been alone in a long time.

18:08.457 --> 18:12.131
I used to dream about it... being alone.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.506
It's gonna be whack.

18:15.490 --> 18:18.488
Well, I spoke to the owner.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.021
Normally he'd be okay with a cosign,

18:20.023 --> 18:21.755
but because your son is a...

18:24.690 --> 18:25.755
...you know.

18:31.157 --> 18:33.266
May I please speak with the owner?

18:33.290 --> 18:35.255
The answer is no.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.923
We'll look at more places tomorrow.

18:50.823 --> 18:53.090
I thought you were flying tonight.

18:53.824 --> 18:55.755
That was the plan, but...

18:58.357 --> 19:00.506
...I want to figure this out.

19:01.257 --> 19:03.798
It's just gonna be more of the same.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.465
Maybe.

19:07.623 --> 19:09.421
But then we'll keep looking the next day.

19:09.423 --> 19:11.688
And the day after that

19:11.690 --> 19:13.888
until we find the right answer, okay?

19:23.856 --> 19:25.100
Yo, what's up?

19:25.124 --> 19:27.122
You here to see my man Pastor G?

19:27.124 --> 19:28.233
What'd you do wrong?

19:28.257 --> 19:30.133
Nothing. I'm his daughter. I'm Zora.

19:30.157 --> 19:32.266
Oh, word? Ah, you family then.

19:32.290 --> 19:33.400
Yeah, I'm Dante.

19:33.424 --> 19:34.488
I know you are.

19:34.490 --> 19:36.622
Come on, little Z, bring it in.

19:41.557 --> 19:44.733
- Hey.
- This is Nikki, the abominable.

19:44.757 --> 19:46.266
What up?

19:46.290 --> 19:48.400
Where's the holy man at?

19:48.424 --> 19:49.721
He is on his way.

19:49.723 --> 19:50.766
He should be here in like 10 minutes.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.255
Y'all got any coffee?

19:52.257 --> 19:54.133
I thought I smelled java walking in.

19:54.157 --> 19:55.733
Yeah, there's a spot down the hall.

19:55.757 --> 19:58.422
Bet. Let's head down there then.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.566
Imma need me a lavender latte.

20:04.590 --> 20:06.137
- Lavender?
- Yeah,

20:06.139 --> 20:08.021
Nikki put me on to it.

20:08.023 --> 20:11.066
They be hitting for real, like, poetic.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.633
Sounds like a real experience.

20:12.657 --> 20:13.901
Yeah.

20:13.925 --> 20:15.954
Nikki always knows what's
gonna be on the shade room

20:15.956 --> 20:17.199
before they post it,

20:17.223 --> 20:19.133
and I'm like, how you do that?

20:19.157 --> 20:21.715
She got the juice and the sauce,
you feel me?

20:22.623 --> 20:25.298
Yeah, yeah, I feel you...

20:25.823 --> 20:27.388
Supremely.

20:32.157 --> 20:34.466
You're not the first person
to get out of prison

20:34.490 --> 20:36.155
and start a new life.

20:39.024 --> 20:41.155
Yeah, but the history books
aren't exactly filled

20:41.157 --> 20:44.006
with people who made it
once they got out, either.

20:44.757 --> 20:46.423
No.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.455
But they're in there.

20:51.590 --> 20:53.590
I'm not what you think.

20:54.057 --> 20:56.255
What do you think I think you are?

20:59.690 --> 21:01.488
I... I don't know.

21:01.490 --> 21:04.355
I just, like...

21:07.090 --> 21:09.266
...broke into a house
looking for something to sell

21:09.290 --> 21:11.222
so I could eat.

21:13.890 --> 21:18.355
I did five years for being
hungry and falling asleep.

21:18.357 --> 21:20.066
Falling asleep how?

21:20.090 --> 21:23.700
The last house I did,
I knew they were on vacation.

21:23.724 --> 21:26.090
It was the middle of the night.

21:27.623 --> 21:29.355
I fell asleep.

21:29.357 --> 21:33.256
It was just nice to be
somewhere cool for a while...

21:33.490 --> 21:35.255
And quiet...

21:37.356 --> 21:38.923
...safe.

21:50.090 --> 21:52.788
I'm not gonna leave until
we find you someplace to stay.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.255
And it'll be cool...

22:01.156 --> 22:03.288
...and quiet...

22:04.890 --> 22:06.888
...and safe.

22:12.057 --> 22:14.022
I promise.

22:17.757 --> 22:19.381
We'll see.

22:21.857 --> 22:24.122
I just bought this condo downtown,

22:24.124 --> 22:26.788
and it's, like, top floor
of a skyscraper.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.899
Nikki's gonna do it.

22:28.923 --> 22:31.521
Yeah, she's gonna make it all, um...

22:31.523 --> 22:33.833
- What's that word, baby?
- Ma.

22:33.857 --> 22:36.832
Yeah, it's gonna have major Ma.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.766
Ma.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.121
It's japanese for "open space."

22:40.123 --> 22:41.988
Brother Saunders.

22:41.990 --> 22:44.166
How you doing? All right.

22:44.190 --> 22:46.332
See you met my lovely daughter.

22:46.356 --> 22:47.522
Hi, sweetie.

22:47.524 --> 22:48.855
Sorry I'm late.

22:48.857 --> 22:50.321
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No doubt.

22:50.323 --> 22:52.455
She was just keeping us company
while we waited, you know.

22:52.457 --> 22:54.381
Yeah, I bet.

22:55.224 --> 22:56.366
Let me talk to you for a minute.

22:56.390 --> 22:59.548
- Okay. Be back in a minute baby.
- All right.

23:05.024 --> 23:07.088
So, what... I'm guessing
you still live at home?

23:07.090 --> 23:08.732
Uh, yeah, kind of.

23:08.756 --> 23:11.221
I live in a cabin on the
estate my grandparents own.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.500
Estate? Let's go check it out.

23:13.524 --> 23:15.188
Without Dante?

23:15.190 --> 23:17.100
Girl, he'll be fine. I'll just text him.

23:17.124 --> 23:18.455
It's all good.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.532
Are you coming?

23:24.556 --> 23:26.155
Yeah.

23:28.357 --> 23:30.555
I'm sorry you came all this way.

23:30.557 --> 23:32.254
Paster Demars took care of me.

23:32.256 --> 23:34.833
He really is a wonderful presence.

23:34.857 --> 23:36.800
Well, what was the problem?

23:36.824 --> 23:38.166
I mean, I know that James and I

23:38.190 --> 23:40.999
are no longer officially a resource,

23:41.023 --> 23:42.866
but you would be sorely mistaken

23:42.890 --> 23:46.400
if you thought we don't both
hold you in our hearts

23:46.424 --> 23:47.500
and look to lift you up.

23:47.524 --> 23:49.488
I appreciate you saying that.

23:49.490 --> 23:52.832
Misty, tell us what's going on.

23:52.856 --> 23:56.066
If it's okay with you both,
I'd really rather not rehash it.

23:56.090 --> 23:58.155
I feel so bad that Karine called you

23:58.157 --> 24:00.800
and got you both so worried.

24:00.824 --> 24:02.732
James, would you mind

24:02.756 --> 24:05.032
giving Misty and I a moment alone?

24:05.056 --> 24:06.888
Where would you propose I go?

24:06.890 --> 24:10.088
Well, perhaps you could go
and turn the car around

24:10.090 --> 24:12.066
and warm it up before I get in.

24:12.090 --> 24:14.866
It's so chilly today.

24:19.090 --> 24:21.633
- Just...
- of course.

24:21.657 --> 24:23.421
I can do that.

24:23.423 --> 24:25.088
Misty.

24:29.557 --> 24:32.866
A lot of people like to use
toothbrushes, brushes.

24:32.890 --> 24:34.400
I use the rat-tail comb

24:34.424 --> 24:36.655
'cause it gives you more definition.

24:38.690 --> 24:40.500
And then you can use the tail

24:40.524 --> 24:43.090
to just give yourself a little swoop.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.522
And then you should be good.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.048
Ooh

24:52.072 --> 24:54.421
girl, you are talented.

24:54.423 --> 24:55.755
You need to teach a class.

24:55.757 --> 24:57.300
Who would come?

24:57.324 --> 24:59.500
Um, I would.

24:59.524 --> 25:01.488
Lay them edges 101.

25:01.490 --> 25:04.066
Highlight and contouring 205.

25:04.090 --> 25:06.488
Twist-outs that last a week 511.

25:08.156 --> 25:09.888
What? You don't believe me?

25:09.890 --> 25:11.999
No, not really.

25:12.023 --> 25:13.399
What's the matter with you?

25:13.423 --> 25:15.488
I don't know. Nothing.

25:15.490 --> 25:18.299
Girl, you are a boss.

25:18.323 --> 25:20.090
Don't you know that?

25:21.424 --> 25:24.088
I guess it's just been a while

25:24.090 --> 25:26.488
since I've got, like, a real compliment.

25:26.490 --> 25:29.066
I was with this guy for a while.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.048
He got you doubting yourself?

25:31.823 --> 25:33.298
Yeah.

25:33.890 --> 25:36.021
I mean, you're past that now, so...

25:36.023 --> 25:38.588
Yeah, but old habits, you know.

25:38.590 --> 25:41.166
No, I don't.

25:41.190 --> 25:43.600
You're in your own place.

25:43.624 --> 25:45.021
You left that boy in the dust,

25:45.023 --> 25:47.288
and hopefully he was asthmatic.

25:48.890 --> 25:50.933
Yeah, buried.

25:50.957 --> 25:52.422
Are you happy now?

25:52.424 --> 25:54.455
Well, happier, at least?

25:56.190 --> 25:57.721
I'm getting there.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.506
I want you to be there now.

26:00.490 --> 26:05.266
♪ Whatever they got,
there's no better change ♪

26:07.156 --> 26:09.954
So y'all just sitting up in here
with the door unlocked?

26:09.956 --> 26:11.599
Very unsafe, ladies.

26:11.623 --> 26:13.600
I told you he'd catch up.

26:13.624 --> 26:15.633
I've come to collect my queen.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.548
I even had to pass through a major gate.

26:19.156 --> 26:21.155
She's all yours, your highness.

26:21.157 --> 26:23.255
I like your style, moneybags.

26:23.257 --> 26:26.266
Yeah, the feng shui is lit.
You be smoking?

26:26.290 --> 26:27.999
- What?
- I'm playing.

26:28.023 --> 26:29.533
Let me know if you want
that loud, though.

26:29.557 --> 26:31.132
Just don't tell your pops.

26:31.156 --> 26:32.666
I'll catch you later, Z.

26:32.690 --> 26:33.955
Okay.

26:33.957 --> 26:35.955
Or not.

26:46.590 --> 26:48.133
What are you up to, Mae?

26:48.157 --> 26:52.381
I just wanted you to know
that as a woman,

26:52.824 --> 26:55.932
you can still continue to lean on me,

26:55.956 --> 26:58.500
just like I said on a day with Lady Mae.

26:58.524 --> 26:59.933
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to stop you

26:59.957 --> 27:01.755
before you embarrass us both.

27:01.757 --> 27:04.766
Excuse me? Embarrass us how?

27:04.790 --> 27:07.532
Grace was to accompany me tomorrow night

27:07.556 --> 27:10.866
to an intervention Fred and I
were doing with Denise.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.488
She's back on the pills again?

27:12.490 --> 27:13.932
- Yes, and worse.
- Oh.

27:13.956 --> 27:16.421
And when I went by the church today,

27:16.423 --> 27:19.532
I was hoping to touch
and agree with Grace

27:19.556 --> 27:21.332
in preparation for that meeting,

27:21.356 --> 27:23.322
I'm so sorry that happened.

27:23.324 --> 27:25.855
Don't be. It all worked out.

27:25.857 --> 27:28.466
Pastor Demars will be joining us instead.

27:28.490 --> 27:30.381
Phil Demars?

27:30.890 --> 27:34.299
- Misty.
- Well, if Grace doesn't even care enough

27:34.323 --> 27:37.921
to contact me and let me know
when she's out of town...

27:37.923 --> 27:39.388
that is unconscionable.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.388
And where is she, anyway?

27:41.390 --> 27:43.966
I mean, I didn't want to make
my daughter a public figure,

27:43.990 --> 27:46.321
but I have a mind to go to the deacons

27:46.323 --> 27:48.332
and tell them about this behavior.

27:48.356 --> 27:51.299
No, no, Misty, please,
if you would just reconsider,

27:51.323 --> 27:54.321
I would very much like to go with you.

27:54.323 --> 27:56.054
No, thank you.

27:56.056 --> 27:59.322
In the absence of Grace,
we prefer Pastor Demars.

28:00.756 --> 28:02.340
To me?

28:02.923 --> 28:05.233
There's something you need to know,

28:05.257 --> 28:07.466
and this is what I meant when I said,

28:07.490 --> 28:09.881
"don't embarrass us both."

28:11.290 --> 28:15.200
When Fred and I voted
to join Harmony and Hope,

28:15.224 --> 28:17.621
it wasn't because we wanted Bishop out.

28:17.623 --> 28:19.688
Then what on earth inspired such a...

28:19.690 --> 28:22.466
it was you we wanted gone.

28:22.490 --> 28:24.066
Now, I'm sorry to put it so plainly, Mae,

28:24.090 --> 28:27.340
but you seem to need to hear it.

28:28.790 --> 28:32.021
But what have I ever done but serve?

28:32.023 --> 28:33.432
There's a perception

28:33.456 --> 28:35.566
that your claim that you knew nothing

28:35.590 --> 28:39.155
about Mac abusing those girls
and that you knew nothing

28:39.157 --> 28:41.621
about him using your scholarship fund

28:41.623 --> 28:43.332
to keep them all quiet...

28:43.356 --> 28:45.555
But I actually didn't know.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.933
We know that's what you say,

28:47.957 --> 28:51.133
but it just doesn't seem possible.

29:13.156 --> 29:15.266
Where you able to get to the bottom of it

29:15.290 --> 29:19.022
without my muddying the waters
with my distasteful presence?

29:21.557 --> 29:23.722
I don't want to talk about it.

29:43.290 --> 29:44.866
Yeah, mama, what's up?

29:44.890 --> 29:47.032
When are you getting back here?

29:47.056 --> 29:48.888
Friday, hopefully. Why?

29:48.890 --> 29:50.600
Hopefully?!

29:50.624 --> 29:53.155
Probably Friday. Why?

29:53.157 --> 29:55.600
Grace, did you not remember
that you were supposed to

29:55.624 --> 30:00.488
go with Misty Williams to
an intervention for Denise?

30:00.490 --> 30:02.132
I'm sorry. I meant to call her.

30:02.156 --> 30:03.400
You're sorry?

30:03.424 --> 30:05.332
Your brother is always off somewhere.

30:05.356 --> 30:08.621
Phil Demars is playing
Pastor to the deacons,

30:08.623 --> 30:12.866
aside from Karine,
nobody is minding the store!

30:12.890 --> 30:15.599
Mama, I'll be back
as soon as I can, okay?

30:15.623 --> 30:17.088
What are you doing in Phoenix?

30:17.090 --> 30:19.355
I told you, I'm dealing with Ray.

30:19.357 --> 30:21.155
Ray is a dead letter.

30:21.157 --> 30:24.088
I want you back here tomorrow.

30:24.090 --> 30:27.400
Phil Demars is one wrinkly-eyed smile

30:27.424 --> 30:30.066
away from taking over
this church... my church...

30:30.090 --> 30:33.400
and I will not accept no for an answer.

30:45.856 --> 30:48.033
Come in.

30:48.057 --> 30:50.632
Judy Whitmore just called me.

30:50.656 --> 30:52.432
About that stanko song of hers?

30:52.456 --> 30:54.888
No, about you.

30:54.890 --> 30:56.332
You e-mailed her.

30:56.356 --> 30:59.000
Yeah, I told her we're
not singing that song,

30:59.024 --> 31:01.688
no way, no how, unh-unh.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.755
Charity, you can't do that.

31:03.757 --> 31:06.088
- Have you heard it?
- A million times.

31:06.090 --> 31:08.888
It sounds like it came
straight from Satan.

31:08.890 --> 31:11.533
Judy is Bob's daughter,

31:11.557 --> 31:13.066
and that song, whatever you think,

31:13.090 --> 31:15.922
is sung every Sunday
at every H-and-H church.

31:15.924 --> 31:18.455
Well, it's not exactly Calvary.

31:18.457 --> 31:21.499
Well, Calvary isn't exactly
Calvary anymore, either.

31:21.523 --> 31:23.988
It's Calvary fellowship
world ministries...

31:23.990 --> 31:26.933
a Harmony and Hope church.

31:26.957 --> 31:28.100
Got it?

31:28.124 --> 31:30.090
Sing the song.

31:30.690 --> 31:33.215
Sorry I made you so mad.

31:33.956 --> 31:36.381
Do you want to be A.P. Or not?

31:37.756 --> 31:38.833
Yeah.

31:38.857 --> 31:41.500
Then grow up.

31:41.524 --> 31:44.121
Well, boss, before you go...

31:44.123 --> 31:46.866
- What?
- Why is Grace in Phoenix?

31:46.890 --> 31:49.722
- Grace is in Phoenix?
- Mm-hmm.

31:49.724 --> 31:52.090
And you didn't know that?

31:52.723 --> 31:54.821
What is she doing in Phoenix?

31:54.823 --> 31:58.631
Well, that's what I was wondering.

31:59.223 --> 32:01.455
Now do you feel bad about
how you came in here

32:01.457 --> 32:03.522
and went off on me like that?

32:06.357 --> 32:08.488
Thank you for telling me.

32:17.090 --> 32:18.923
Hey, you got a minute?

32:20.424 --> 32:23.488
I gave some more thought
to your dream, Mae,

32:23.490 --> 32:26.955
and maybe I was wrong.

32:26.957 --> 32:28.881
No.

32:29.624 --> 32:31.036
You weren't wrong.

32:31.038 --> 32:32.953
Well, at the very least, I should have

32:33.757 --> 32:36.688
asked for some time to take it in,

32:36.690 --> 32:40.488
to pray and see if it resonated.

32:40.490 --> 32:43.215
The dream was for me, James,

32:44.156 --> 32:47.715
and I was wrong to
come after you with it.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.178
It was for me. It was a warning.

32:55.157 --> 32:57.506
What are you up to with all that?

32:58.090 --> 32:59.965
I don't know.

33:00.823 --> 33:02.481
Is that Faith?

33:04.970 --> 33:06.256
Yes.

33:07.057 --> 33:08.388
Mm.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.715
Do you think I knew?

33:14.923 --> 33:16.322
Knew what?

33:19.123 --> 33:22.366
What Mac was doing, you know, with Faith

33:22.390 --> 33:25.932
and the other girls and the money and...

33:25.956 --> 33:27.351
Of course not.

33:27.375 --> 33:28.541
Hmm.

33:28.565 --> 33:30.055
Ah.

33:30.057 --> 33:32.600
Is that what Misty said to you
to make you so upset?

33:32.624 --> 33:35.600
- Huh?
- They all think I knew.

33:35.624 --> 33:38.132
And I am just trying to picture the woman

33:38.156 --> 33:41.332
that they think I am,
and she's a monster.

33:41.356 --> 33:44.866
I mean, I wouldn't want her
standing up smiling at me

33:44.890 --> 33:47.933
from pulpit every Sunday.
I just would not want that.

33:47.957 --> 33:49.500
You didn't know!

33:49.524 --> 33:51.423
But maybe...

33:52.090 --> 33:53.798
I did.

33:54.323 --> 33:56.700
And I didn't.

33:56.724 --> 33:58.548
Maybe...

33:59.190 --> 34:01.266
Is that possible?

34:01.290 --> 34:04.355
Can you just fool yourself so completely

34:04.357 --> 34:07.400
that you're just living a dream?

34:07.424 --> 34:10.255
- I don't know!
- You didn't know.

34:13.422 --> 34:18.199
I keep thinking that we're past it,

34:18.224 --> 34:22.054
and it just keeps
coming back, but my baby...

34:24.623 --> 34:27.340
...she's just so gone.

34:27.924 --> 34:31.500
She's all gone... a sweet little...

34:31.524 --> 34:34.733
oh, oh, James.

34:34.757 --> 34:36.222
Okay, okay.

34:40.290 --> 34:43.088
- Hey, what's going on?
- What's up, bro?

34:43.090 --> 34:44.755
I'll check you later.

34:45.356 --> 34:47.487
Hey, uh, I need to talk
to you about something.

34:47.489 --> 34:49.132
I think I found a cool place.

34:49.157 --> 34:50.333
Yeah?

34:50.357 --> 34:51.621
But the landlord's
out of town till tomorrow,

34:51.623 --> 34:54.154
so I thought we could
pick up some sheets,

34:54.156 --> 34:56.688
a blow-up mattress,
maybe, you know, the basics.

34:56.690 --> 34:57.922
A.J., listen, so...

34:57.924 --> 34:59.188
I'll pay you back once I'm working,

34:59.190 --> 35:00.232
for the sheets and stuff.

35:00.256 --> 35:02.131
Honey, it's not about that.

35:02.923 --> 35:04.122
What?

35:04.124 --> 35:07.288
I have to fly home tonight,
just for a few days

35:07.290 --> 35:08.732
to get some things straightened
out with the church.

35:08.756 --> 35:10.488
But I'll leave you with some cash

35:10.490 --> 35:11.821
just for the meantime.

35:11.823 --> 35:13.715
No, you know what?

35:14.690 --> 35:16.548
That's okay.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.266
A.J., I'm really sorry.

35:19.290 --> 35:22.888
No, just go. Really, it's cool.

35:22.890 --> 35:23.988
I'll be back as soon as I can.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.521
No, don't!

35:25.523 --> 35:27.266
I mean it. Don't.

35:27.290 --> 35:28.488
Would you listen to what I'm saying?

35:28.490 --> 35:30.166
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm coming back.

35:30.190 --> 35:33.381
I don't want you to, okay?

35:33.957 --> 35:38.533
I'm sorry I called and bothered you.

35:38.557 --> 35:40.488
I'm sorry...

35:40.490 --> 35:42.655
I exist.

35:46.957 --> 35:48.247
Can I go in there?

35:48.271 --> 35:50.321
No.

36:01.090 --> 36:03.688
- For you.
- Oh.

36:03.690 --> 36:04.888
What'd you do now?

36:06.090 --> 36:09.048
Nothing, and, uh...

36:09.557 --> 36:11.673
I think that's the problem.

36:12.390 --> 36:13.566
I'm listening.

36:13.590 --> 36:15.566
I don't think about making you feel loved

36:15.590 --> 36:18.321
like it's something
I gotta get done every day,

36:18.323 --> 36:20.423
you know, like everything else.

36:20.790 --> 36:23.855
But it is. I gotta do it.

36:23.857 --> 36:25.300
Oh.

36:25.324 --> 36:29.666
So, from now on, I'm gonna do just that.

36:29.690 --> 36:32.488
I'm gonna make you
my number-one priority.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.423
Oh, thank you.

36:34.823 --> 36:36.355
That is so sweet.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.388
Mm.

36:43.324 --> 36:45.721
But I gotta say something.

36:45.723 --> 36:47.666
You should quit while you're ahead.

36:51.290 --> 36:54.266
I... I don't want to
sell the land, all right?

36:54.290 --> 36:55.600
Just leave it alone for a little while.

36:55.624 --> 36:59.131
It's just a piece of land,
and I'm your wife.

37:01.990 --> 37:03.965
What's it gonna be?

37:14.756 --> 37:16.422
Hello?

37:18.490 --> 37:20.965
All right, yes, ma'am.
We'll be right down.

37:21.924 --> 37:23.921
Hey, Christy, it's Phil Demars.

37:23.923 --> 37:26.465
Hey, sorry to call so late.

37:26.756 --> 37:28.955
Oh, good. Hey, I'm just curious...

37:28.957 --> 37:31.866
has, uh, Grace Greenleaf been by

37:31.890 --> 37:34.173
to see Bob anytime lately?

37:34.623 --> 37:37.256
Grace Greenleaf of Calvary?

37:38.090 --> 37:39.800
No?

37:39.824 --> 37:41.755
Okay, well, thank you.

37:41.757 --> 37:45.666
Oh, no reason. Thanks again.

37:45.690 --> 37:46.888
Mm-hmm, bye.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.922
Gigi, is that you?

38:00.290 --> 38:02.288
Yeah, mama, I'm back.

38:02.290 --> 38:04.866
We're in the family room.

38:12.356 --> 38:15.173
Do you remember this?

38:15.823 --> 38:19.088
We took you to Sears
to take your first pictures,

38:19.090 --> 38:21.088
and you sat there like a little lady.

38:21.090 --> 38:24.488
You didn't cry or anything.

38:24.490 --> 38:26.266
- Oh.
- You sure that was Charity?

38:26.290 --> 38:28.066
- Oh.
- Daddy!

38:29.224 --> 38:30.466
What are you all doing up so late?

38:30.490 --> 38:33.133
Oh, your mother...
she broke out the slides.

38:33.157 --> 38:34.421
Can I join?

38:34.423 --> 38:37.088
Yes, that's why I hollered. Come on.

38:37.090 --> 38:39.388
How was Phoenix?

38:39.390 --> 38:41.855
It was unclear.

38:41.857 --> 38:44.755
Ray giving you trouble again, Gigi?

38:44.757 --> 38:45.854
Not exactly, Daddy.

38:45.856 --> 38:47.333
How 'bout Bob?

38:47.357 --> 38:48.494
Bob who?

38:48.518 --> 38:51.332
Bob Whitmore, duh.

38:51.356 --> 38:54.021
I didn't see Bob Whitmore.
Why would I see Bob Whitmore?

38:54.023 --> 38:56.766
Oh, Jacob, thank you for coming down.

38:56.790 --> 38:57.988
Yes, ma'am.

38:57.990 --> 39:00.300
Do you remember how this thing works?

39:00.324 --> 39:01.700
I think your father broke it.

39:01.724 --> 39:04.322
I didn't break it!

39:04.324 --> 39:06.466
Just look it over, would you?

39:06.490 --> 39:08.355
- All right.
- Yes, ma'am.

39:08.357 --> 39:11.021
Come on pop. I got it.
I'll take a look at it.

39:11.023 --> 39:12.166
Go ahead.

39:12.190 --> 39:13.732
Give me a second. I'll figure it out.

39:13.756 --> 39:16.055
Take a break.

39:16.057 --> 39:18.488
Thank you for coming home.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.932
Sure. No problem.

39:20.956 --> 39:25.000
Hmm. Listen, if there's anything going on

39:25.024 --> 39:26.988
that I should know, tell me.

39:30.690 --> 39:32.422
There's nothing going on.

39:34.690 --> 39:36.132
Okay.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.800
- Pop.
- Yeah?

39:37.824 --> 39:40.288
You forgot to plug it in.

39:43.224 --> 39:44.666
I told you I didn't break it.

39:44.690 --> 39:46.788
- All right!
- All right.

39:46.790 --> 39:48.332
Y'all ready to get this party cracking?

39:48.356 --> 39:50.955
- All right.
- Yes. Show time.

39:50.957 --> 39:53.599
I haven't seen these in so long.

39:53.623 --> 39:55.423
All right.

39:56.624 --> 39:58.633
Oh, that's Faith. I'm sorry, mama.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.222
I didn't realize
that was the first slide.

40:00.224 --> 40:01.755
No, leave it.

40:01.757 --> 40:03.555
Please leave it.

40:06.756 --> 40:09.488
Gigi, come sit.

40:11.257 --> 40:13.821
Come sit beside me.

40:33.490 --> 40:35.200
Move to the next slide?

40:35.224 --> 40:37.381
Not yet, son.

40:38.690 --> 40:40.715
Not just yet.

40:41.924 --> 40:44.984
It just feels so nice to...

40:47.856 --> 40:50.266
...to be together.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.788
So nice.

41:22.557 --> 41:23.755
Hello?

41:23.757 --> 41:27.132
Hi. Uh, is A.J. Available?

41:27.156 --> 41:29.800
Let me check. Hang on a moment.

41:39.490 --> 41:41.755
Hello. This is A.J. Who is this?

41:41.757 --> 41:45.288
A.J., hi. It's me... Grace.

41:45.290 --> 41:46.922
What do you want?

41:50.090 --> 41:52.066
I want you to come home.
