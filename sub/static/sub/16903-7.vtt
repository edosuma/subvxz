There's a lot of history in studio 4C.

00:03.542 --> 00:06.097
<i>To catch a predator,</i>
<i>the XFL halftime show,</i>

00:06.132 --> 00:07.805
Storage for broken copier equipment,

00:07.874 --> 00:10.409
And now...
<i>Dealbreakers.</i>

00:10.476 --> 00:14.276
Liz Lemon's got her very own talk show!

00:15.484 --> 00:17.295
♪ I'm a star ♪

00:17.363 --> 00:18.727
♪ I'm on top ♪

00:18.795 --> 00:24.145
♪ somebody bring me some ham ♪

00:24.212 --> 00:25.477
I used to sing that when I was a kid.

00:25.544 --> 00:27.880
Yes, well, it's really happening for you,
Lemon.

00:27.948 --> 00:32.022
Between <i>TGS</i> and this, You're
like a swarthy, big-hipped Kelly Ripa.

00:32.088 --> 00:34.088
I know.
I mean, if this works,

00:34.158 --> 00:36.725
my life will be totally different.

00:39.762 --> 00:44.734
♪ ♪

00:47.468 --> 00:51.270
I have to go back into space, Liz.
I hope you enjoyed the kissing,

00:51.339 --> 00:54.673
followed by my genuine interest
in that TV dance competition.

00:54.741 --> 00:57.538
Bye, astronaut Mike Dexter.

01:00.975 --> 01:02.610
Liz! Snap out of it!

01:02.677 --> 01:04.177
Jenna's locked herself
in her dressing room!

01:04.245 --> 01:06.778
What? No, go away.
This is my fantasy, Pete!

01:06.846 --> 01:08.814
I knew it.
You're blonde in your fantasies.

01:08.881 --> 01:10.249
It looks terrible.

01:10.317 --> 01:11.717
Oh!

01:15.756 --> 01:17.156
Jenna, what's wrong?

01:17.224 --> 01:20.258
My niece drew a picture of me,
and I look so fat!

01:20.325 --> 01:23.092
Well, I really like your hair today.

01:23.159 --> 01:27.028
Thank you! But you don't know what it
looks like, because of the door!

01:27.094 --> 01:28.729
Wow, she finally figured that out.

01:28.796 --> 01:30.263
Okay, Jenna, you win.

01:30.331 --> 01:32.766
If you're really not feeling
up to doing the show this week,

01:32.834 --> 01:35.436
I know that Jenny McCarthy is in town.

01:35.505 --> 01:37.271
My nemesis?
Never!

01:37.338 --> 01:41.241
Oh, my god.
I bet she put Charlotte up to this.

01:41.309 --> 01:44.545
Lemon, that is why <i>Dealbreakers</i>
is going to work,

01:44.613 --> 01:47.748
because your star is a crazy person,
and my star is you.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.051
And I am not crazy,
because unlike Jenna,

01:50.118 --> 01:52.087
My mother never used
my beauty pageant winnings

01:52.154 --> 01:54.123
to buy her married boyfriend
a motorcycle.

01:54.190 --> 01:55.123
Exactly.

01:55.192 --> 01:57.225
Boy, if this thing works,
it could be my ticket out.

01:57.294 --> 01:59.462
This job is starting to get to me.

01:59.497 --> 02:02.664
Lately, I've been shoplifting
just to feel in control.

02:02.732 --> 02:07.599
'cause no one knows I took the candy bar.
No one but Peter.

02:10.634 --> 02:13.970
- Liz Lemon, I need to talk to you.
- What's up, Tray?

02:14.039 --> 02:15.472
Come over here and check out my corner.

02:15.541 --> 02:17.408
- No trap.
- What?

02:17.475 --> 02:20.143
Come over here, I said...
In my normal tone of voice.

02:21.812 --> 02:25.747
Liz Lemon, recently I realized
that I have a hole in my heart,

02:25.816 --> 02:27.582
and not the one I got
from eating batteries.

02:27.651 --> 02:29.352
It's 'cause I don't have a daughter.

02:29.418 --> 02:33.155
- Well, that's actually sweet.
- I want a baby girl, Liz Lemon.

02:33.222 --> 02:36.725
I mean, havin' a daughter's Like
goin' to the nba all-star weekend.

02:36.792 --> 02:40.461
It changes you. Makes you want to
take your wife to the doctor.

02:40.529 --> 02:43.896
- Well, I think that's great, Tray.
- I'm glad you feel that way,

02:43.964 --> 02:47.000
Because Angie's on her way up,
and I want you to tell her for me.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.269
- Oh, no. I'm not doin' that.
- Oh, yes, you are. Click.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.106
I said "click" to distract you
from the sound of the handcuffs.

02:53.174 --> 02:57.445
- What?
- Uh-uh!

02:57.514 --> 03:01.047
Why are you handcuffed to the bookshelf
I built for my husband?

03:01.115 --> 03:03.983
Tracy did this to make me tell you
that he wants to have a baby girl.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.618
- You did good.
- Really? Have you lost your mind?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.653
I'm not gonna raise
another child by myself.

03:09.721 --> 03:12.891
What are you implying?
I'm a very attentive father.

03:12.958 --> 03:14.058
Oh, please, tracy.

03:14.126 --> 03:16.961
Where were you last week during
Tracy, Jr. 's birthday party?

03:17.029 --> 03:19.364
There was a better kid's
birthday party up the street!

03:19.431 --> 03:21.499
I cannot believe you made me
come here for this.

03:21.566 --> 03:24.201
Now I won't have enough time
to shop for Christmas presents

03:24.271 --> 03:26.637
- and still get my hair did.
- Your hair did?

03:26.704 --> 03:30.073
You just got your hair did!
You have to get your hair did again?

03:30.142 --> 03:33.711
- It needs to be did every week!
- Maybe we could un-did these handcuffs.

03:33.777 --> 03:35.544
- Oh, cracker!
- Racist!

03:35.612 --> 03:37.913
You know what?
Keep your hair appointment.

03:37.981 --> 03:41.317
I'll do the Christmas shopping this year
to prove to you I can be reliable

03:41.384 --> 03:44.218
and that I can finish everything that I-

03:50.091 --> 03:54.096
No. Come back!
Ah!

03:57.131 --> 03:59.907
Season 4 Episode 7
Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

04:13.613 --> 04:14.880
Listen up, dummies,

04:14.947 --> 04:17.249
I'm gonna be gone this week
doing my talk show,

04:17.315 --> 04:19.786
so I need to leave someone
responsible in charge.

04:19.853 --> 04:23.956
Now, it's not about who I like the most
or who's the funniest, so it's Toofer.

04:24.024 --> 04:25.190
Oh, thank you.

04:25.258 --> 04:27.759
As Tennyson wrote,
"I mete and dole unequal-"

04:27.827 --> 04:30.896
No, never mind.
Lutz, you want it?

04:30.963 --> 04:35.600
Mm-hmm.
Oh, okay.

04:35.668 --> 04:38.436
Too much pressure.
Writers who never talk,

04:38.505 --> 04:40.471
Anyone want a promotion?

04:40.539 --> 04:43.241
Great! Frank, congratulations.
You are the new boss.

04:43.308 --> 04:45.876
Awesome.
A cool person in charge for once.

04:45.944 --> 04:47.811
My first act as leader,

04:47.880 --> 04:50.215
I'm telling them to take down
the Internet firewall.

04:50.282 --> 04:51.683
We can surf porn again.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.251
- Wonderful, porn!
- I like porn.

04:55.655 --> 04:58.590
Sir?
A Mr. Adouche is on the phone.

04:58.658 --> 05:02.760
- I.M. Adouche?
- I am a douche?

05:04.229 --> 05:05.296
Banks!

05:06.832 --> 05:07.931
What do you want?

05:07.999 --> 05:09.966
- Did you say it?
- No, I knew right away.

05:10.034 --> 05:13.404
Aw, sure, you did.
Well, D.C.'s great.

05:13.471 --> 05:15.438
So many men in uniform down here.

05:15.506 --> 05:17.708
If you're calling to check in
on your bailout money,

05:17.775 --> 05:19.009
just read the budgets we sent.

05:19.078 --> 05:20.610
We're getting more efficient every day.

05:20.678 --> 05:23.382
Our health care costs are way down
since we started putting something

05:23.417 --> 05:25.116
in the coffee to keep women
from getting pregnant.

05:25.185 --> 05:27.685
It's funny, I have been
reading the budgets,

05:27.753 --> 05:30.154
and I couldn't help but notice
that you're doing a talk show

05:30.221 --> 05:32.790
- with your four-eyed little friend.
- That is a business decision.

05:32.858 --> 05:35.293
- She wrote a very popular book.
- It doesn't matter.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.496
Do you know how bad that could look?
Worse than me in capri pants...

05:38.564 --> 05:40.331
Which you'd think I'd be able
to pull off 'cause I'm tall.

05:40.399 --> 05:41.531
What are you saying, banks?

05:41.599 --> 05:46.504
If this Liz Lemon project loses one penny,
I am gonna publicly flog you like...

05:46.570 --> 05:48.805
Well, like me at the
provincetown flogging festival.

05:48.873 --> 05:51.606
In other words,
it had better work.

05:51.674 --> 05:53.041
But don't worry.

05:53.109 --> 05:55.877
She's just a writer
with zero performing experience.

05:55.945 --> 05:58.513
It'll work.
I'll make it work.

05:58.582 --> 06:00.283
- Moron says what?
- What?

06:02.152 --> 06:04.620
What does he say?
<i>What?</i>

06:05.234 --> 06:07.295
I need a special gift for my wife,

06:07.330 --> 06:09.092
something that says I'm responsible.

06:09.159 --> 06:12.662
- Something simple, classy.
- I get it-elegance.

06:12.728 --> 06:15.996
That's why people come to
Yakov's Nubian Bling Explosion.

06:16.063 --> 06:17.531
Yeah, it's perfect.

06:17.598 --> 06:21.067
What's that? I want it!
I forgot why I originally came in here!

06:21.135 --> 06:23.604
Oh, that belonged
to Philip Michael Thomas,

06:23.671 --> 06:25.871
The actor who played
Tubbs on <i>Miami Vice.</i>

06:25.940 --> 06:30.211
Sure. I know him from the
secret black people meetings.

06:30.277 --> 06:32.445
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
He's not invited.

06:32.512 --> 06:35.215
- But who's "EGOT"?
- "EGOT" is not a person, T.J.

06:35.283 --> 06:39.753
It's a goal. It stands for Emmy,
Grammy, Oscar, and Tony,

06:39.821 --> 06:43.023
Four awards that Thomas planned
on winning in his career.

06:43.091 --> 06:46.593
That's a good goal for
a talented crazy person.

06:46.662 --> 06:48.662
Anyway, you wanted something
special for your wife.

06:48.730 --> 06:50.830
Nah, that was earlier.
I want this.

06:50.899 --> 06:52.499
So how you feelin'?
Feelin' good? Ready to go?

06:52.566 --> 06:55.695
With <i>dealbreakers</i> ? Yeah.
The set looks great, I'm ready.

06:55.730 --> 06:56.734
We just need an audience.

06:56.802 --> 06:58.237
I just want to make sure
we're not forgetting anything,

06:58.304 --> 06:59.504
because this has to work.

06:59.571 --> 07:01.908
Has to work?
It's gonna work, right?

07:01.974 --> 07:06.246
Yes, because it has to.
And because we've thought of everything.

07:06.314 --> 07:10.150
- What if you didn't wear your glasses?
- What? You think it's not a good look?

07:10.218 --> 07:11.317
Well, I don't know.
Are you married?

07:11.352 --> 07:14.954
- I'm just saying.
- Well, I can lose the glasses.

07:15.022 --> 07:16.856
I just might not be able
to read the teleprompter,

07:16.924 --> 07:20.527
and I can't wear contacts 'cause the
doctor says my eyeballs are too pointy.

07:20.595 --> 07:22.685
What about Lasik?
The show'll pay for it.

07:22.820 --> 07:26.565
- Okay, if you think it's a good idea.
- Great. Now we're perfect.

07:26.634 --> 07:28.734
What if we change your name
to Veronica St. Pierre?

07:28.801 --> 07:30.436
No, that's too much.

07:30.504 --> 07:32.972
Your hair...

07:33.339 --> 07:34.106
Is fine.

07:41.315 --> 07:42.682
- Marco!
- Both: Polo!

07:42.750 --> 07:43.787
Ha!

07:44.122 --> 07:44.884
Marco!

07:44.951 --> 07:48.253
Tracy, put that sword down
and help me take these gifts to the car.

07:48.322 --> 07:51.859
No need. I got something better than
presents for you and the kids.

07:51.925 --> 07:54.593
I got us all this "EGOT" necklace for me.

07:54.662 --> 07:56.628
That's exactly what I was talkin' about.

07:56.695 --> 08:00.576
I send you out for gifts, and you go and
buy that dumb necklace for yourself.

08:00.611 --> 08:04.300
It's not dumb. It's smart.
This necklace is a life goal.

08:04.368 --> 08:08.204
I'm gonna win me a Emmy,
a Grammy, a Oscar, and a Tony.

08:08.371 --> 08:09.238
What?

08:09.307 --> 08:12.042
Tracy, you've never finished
a damn thing in your life.

08:12.110 --> 08:15.613
I am gonna "EGOT,"
for us, for the family,

08:15.680 --> 08:18.414
and especially for little
Chewbaquina Jordan.

08:19.482 --> 08:23.488
Okay, Tray. You go out and
win every one of those awards

08:23.554 --> 08:26.957
and prove how responsible you are,
and I'll give you a daughter.

08:27.025 --> 08:30.659
But until then, I don't want to hear
another word about your baby girl.

08:30.728 --> 08:32.861
Great.
I'll be in touch.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.030
- You still using your Hotmail account?
- Mm.

08:37.666 --> 08:40.102
One more...

08:40.169 --> 08:42.701
And done-zies.

08:43.164 --> 08:44.907
- Did it work?
- Oh, I'm sure it did.

08:44.974 --> 08:48.111
This machine is a genuine...
"Lasig"?

08:48.177 --> 08:52.181
Hmm, curious.
Here.

08:52.249 --> 08:54.483
Can you read the top line over there?

08:54.551 --> 08:58.487
"Dear, Dr. Spaceman,
thank you for your submission.

08:58.556 --> 09:03.292
"<i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>
does not publish X-rated cartoons. "

09:03.359 --> 09:04.860
Well, why not?

09:04.928 --> 09:09.866
It's so frustrating.
But at least I heard it from a friend.

09:09.933 --> 09:12.601
So while we're here,
what else do you want to do?

09:12.669 --> 09:14.603
Face burn?
Bone morph?

09:14.671 --> 09:17.007
- Mouth peel?
- No, thank you. I can't.

09:17.074 --> 09:18.975
I'm gonna be on TV this week.

09:19.042 --> 09:22.210
- Really? I think you mean radio.
- No, I don't.

09:22.278 --> 09:23.378
What is-what-

09:23.446 --> 09:25.112
Why do people keep saying
stuff like that?

09:25.180 --> 09:27.549
You seem nervous.
I could give you something for that.

09:27.616 --> 09:29.249
But you know what?

09:29.317 --> 09:32.185
I'm not supposed to have
sex with my patients.

09:33.388 --> 09:35.355
Your hair is...

09:35.424 --> 09:36.423
Fine.

09:43.294 --> 09:45.327
Hey, we're all going
to Chuck E. Cheese's.

09:45.395 --> 09:46.963
It's divorced Hispanic mom night.

09:47.030 --> 09:48.265
I can't.

09:48.332 --> 09:49.799
I've gotta proof
all these sketches,

09:49.867 --> 09:51.601
Figure out the rundown,
then meet with props in...

09:51.668 --> 09:52.635
Ten minutes!

09:52.702 --> 09:53.703
Okay.

09:53.770 --> 09:55.304
Have a good night, Liz.

09:55.371 --> 09:56.538
Very funny.

09:56.606 --> 09:58.474
I'm not Liz!

10:00.309 --> 10:02.544
Ooh, ham.

10:02.612 --> 10:04.013
Mmm!

10:04.079 --> 10:05.445
That's good.

10:07.015 --> 10:11.254
I'd first like to thank my creative team
For coming here on such short notice,

10:11.320 --> 10:13.288
And I'm sorry
I'm four hours late.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.390
Dotcom, research update.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.959
I googled a complete list
of all past "EGOT" winners.

10:18.027 --> 10:18.993
Listen to this.

10:19.062 --> 10:20.761
"Composer Richard Rodgers,

10:20.828 --> 10:22.563
"Composer Jonathan Tunick,

10:22.631 --> 10:24.497
Composer Marvin Hamlisch. "

10:24.565 --> 10:25.865
That's good raw data.

10:25.933 --> 10:28.202
Now turn it over to Grizz for analysis.

10:30.537 --> 10:31.971
They're all composers.

10:32.038 --> 10:34.707
Kenneth, synthesize Grizz's analysis.

10:34.774 --> 10:38.076
Mr. Jordan, you need
to write one great song,

10:38.144 --> 10:41.413
A song whose success will
get it featured on a TV show,

10:41.481 --> 10:43.750
and then a movie based on that TV show.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.851
and then a broadway play
based on that movie.

10:45.919 --> 10:48.554
This is how I'm gonna get my baby girl!

10:48.621 --> 10:53.459
All I have to do is create
the most popular song of all time.

10:53.526 --> 10:56.460
♪ I've started already ♪

10:56.529 --> 10:58.405
That's great, Tray.
- It's all happening!

11:00.242 --> 11:02.467
It's all happening!

11:02.535 --> 11:03.701
Hi.

11:03.771 --> 11:06.439
You got a haircut.
Oh, actually, I got three haircuts.

11:06.506 --> 11:09.007
The first two made me look nuts.

11:09.076 --> 11:11.377
Hey, do I say the word "camer-ah" weird?

11:11.443 --> 11:15.146
Camer-ah.

11:18.284 --> 11:22.285
I need to talk to you.
I have an actress problem.

11:22.354 --> 11:24.991
Okay. Don't try to
move the body yourself.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.294
No. It's Liz.
I need <i>dealbreakers</i> to work.

11:29.361 --> 11:32.731
And yesterday, I told her that
she shouldn't wear her glasses.

11:32.797 --> 11:35.566
Oh, no!
Why did you do that?

11:35.634 --> 11:38.701
Jack, you don't know what
it's like to be on camer-ah.

11:38.770 --> 11:41.605
You're vulnerable.
You're exposed.

11:41.673 --> 11:43.674
It doesn't take a lot
to send you over the edge.

11:43.741 --> 11:47.110
- This is Lemon.
- Not anymore. You've created two lizzes,

11:47.177 --> 11:51.078
Regular Liz and performer Liz.
You've got to lie to her,

11:51.146 --> 11:53.547
Coddle her, protect her
from the real world.

11:53.617 --> 11:54.648
I get it.

11:54.718 --> 11:57.585
Treat her like <i>The New York Times</i>
treats its readers.

11:58.820 --> 12:02.655
Guys, standards is saying no
to the rubik's pube thing.

12:03.758 --> 12:04.991
What?

12:05.059 --> 12:08.165
- You look exactly like Liz.
- What? Shut up.

12:08.230 --> 12:09.996
You've just never seen
my reading glasses before,

12:10.066 --> 12:11.865
which I have to wear
to read your dumb sketches.

12:11.933 --> 12:15.968
And I lost my hat after I threw it
at a bus that wouldn't stop for me,

12:16.035 --> 12:17.436
Even though the guy
could see me running.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.639
- What about the purse and sweater?
- This is a bag

12:20.707 --> 12:22.508
For all the scripts
I now have to carry,

12:22.575 --> 12:24.609
And I'm wearing a sweater
'cause the studio's cold.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.714
You know what?
I don't have to explain myself.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.583
You dummies have no idea
what it's like to be in charge.

12:31.653 --> 12:36.554
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be in
my office trying to have it all!

12:44.096 --> 12:46.364
What is happening to me?

12:47.465 --> 12:51.102
<i>Dealbreakers</i> main titles,
Take number 510.

12:51.169 --> 12:52.236
Okay, here we go.

12:52.303 --> 12:53.471
One more!
This is the one!

12:53.539 --> 12:55.138
And action!

12:55.205 --> 12:57.674
Great, and smile.

12:58.942 --> 13:00.076
With your mouth.

13:01.311 --> 13:02.478
And raise the roof!

13:02.545 --> 13:05.048
Yeah, you look-
boy, you can do it!

13:05.115 --> 13:07.183
Good!
Oh, my god.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.752
Break it down,
break it down.

13:09.821 --> 13:12.553
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Sassy. Sass it up.

13:12.621 --> 13:14.790
Wave to a friend.
Wave like a human being.

13:14.857 --> 13:16.792
You remember waving?

13:16.860 --> 13:17.860
And blow a kiss.

13:17.926 --> 13:20.461
No, with your hands!

13:22.598 --> 13:23.931
And, uh...

13:24.000 --> 13:26.868
A little cleavage.

13:26.935 --> 13:27.935
Nope!

13:28.003 --> 13:30.805
And just have fun.

13:30.873 --> 13:32.406
Are you spinning a basketball?

13:32.474 --> 13:33.608
This is great.

13:33.675 --> 13:36.777
You look really relaxed.
I'd watch this show.

13:36.844 --> 13:38.980
- Okay.
- What's happening to her?

13:39.047 --> 13:40.849
Okay, Lemon, step in front
of the high-def camera.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.150
Let's see what that looks like.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.820
No! No high-def,
Uh, because of the camera.

13:46.889 --> 13:50.457
The, uh, gobos are really moraying,
right, pete?

13:50.523 --> 13:51.623
Please step away!

13:51.691 --> 13:55.428
- I have a delivery for miss Lemon.
- Oh, an opening night bouquet.

13:55.495 --> 13:58.663
- I wonder who sent that?
- They're from devin banks.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.465
- Oh!
- Banks?

14:00.532 --> 14:05.103
"F.E.M.A. Paid for these flowers because
your show is going to be a disaster. "

14:05.171 --> 14:07.272
- Jack, what is this?
- Oh, god!

14:07.340 --> 14:09.508
I got a tattoo that
says "freedom" in Chinese,

14:09.576 --> 14:11.409
And for what?

14:14.680 --> 14:16.847
May I have a moment alone
with Lemon, please?

14:20.586 --> 14:22.819
Okay, here's the honest truth.

14:22.887 --> 14:24.421
You're better at this than Oprah.

14:26.857 --> 14:28.125
I need a minute.

Mr. Jordan, I'm not sure
you've thought this through.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.681
Oh, yeah, ken?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.851
What do you know about
the pressures of "EGOT"- ing?

15:18.917 --> 15:21.651
I need to speak
to someone who's been there,

15:21.719 --> 15:22.885
A fellow "EGOT"- er.

15:23.675 --> 15:25.489
Tracy, what are you doing?

15:25.556 --> 15:28.292
You're supposed to be in a fitting.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.860
Nerds!

15:31.563 --> 15:34.231
Is it me, or is Liz Lemon getting hotter?

15:40.205 --> 15:42.473
- Lemon, it's Jack.
- Don't even bother!

15:42.541 --> 15:44.509
I've been on the other side
of that door, Jack.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.111
You can't outsmart me.
I know all the tricks.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.315
- It's like that movie, <i>The Negotiator</i>.
- I didn't see that.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.051
In the end, the police chief
turns out to be the bad guy.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.785
I didn't say I wasn't going to see it.

15:54.853 --> 15:57.888
Lemon, what is it going to take to get
you out of there? What do you want?

15:57.955 --> 16:00.491
I don't want to do this show anymore!
Shut it down!

16:00.558 --> 16:02.925
I can't do that.
If this thing loses money,

16:02.993 --> 16:06.328
I may as well let banks play out one of
his gay home invasion fantasies on me.

16:06.396 --> 16:09.364
Then I guess it's a standoff!

16:09.432 --> 16:12.734
And I want pizzas for
all the hungry people in here!

16:12.802 --> 16:16.238
- So you tryin' to "EGOT," huh?
- I gotta "EGOT," Whoopi.

16:16.307 --> 16:18.173
See, I made this deal with my wife.

16:18.241 --> 16:20.275
If I don't "EGOT,"
then I can't have another kid.

16:20.342 --> 16:23.045
You know, I got my "EGOT" on a bet too.

16:23.111 --> 16:25.379
That's why Arlen Specter
had to change parties.

16:25.447 --> 16:27.748
You created the supermajority?

16:27.817 --> 16:29.049
Mm.

16:29.117 --> 16:30.817
I don't get it.
Why is it so hard?

16:30.886 --> 16:34.255
I paid all these people to create the
most popular song in the world for me.

16:34.322 --> 16:35.722
That's the problem right there.

16:35.791 --> 16:38.057
You cannot fake your way
to a "EGOT," fool.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.626
You know,
all these awards I got,

16:40.695 --> 16:42.896
I got for projects I believed in.

16:42.963 --> 16:47.566
- Wait! Is that a daytime Emmy?
- It still counts. Girl's gotta eat.

16:47.635 --> 16:49.468
Listen, my point really is,

16:49.536 --> 16:52.738
it's gotta come from the heart,
and then the awards will follow.

16:52.807 --> 16:55.674
- That's good advice, Whoopi.
- Mm-hmm.

16:55.741 --> 16:57.008
Say...

16:57.075 --> 16:59.110
Can I have a glass of water
before I leave?

16:59.177 --> 17:02.380
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thank you.

17:07.354 --> 17:11.490
Colored man, put it back.
Put it down.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.294
Lemon, come out.

17:16.361 --> 17:19.731
Jack, I just got your business sext.
What have you done?

17:19.799 --> 17:21.165
This is no time to play the blame game.

17:21.233 --> 17:23.300
Of course not.
I'm not wearing my outfit.

17:23.367 --> 17:26.269
Jenna, you're the only one who knows
what Lemon is going through right now.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.371
Help me.

17:27.438 --> 17:29.907
Well...
I hate to even tell you this,

17:29.974 --> 17:32.809
but I've always wondered why you guys
don't take the door off its hinges.

17:32.876 --> 17:35.645
<i>That's not gonna work!</i>

17:35.713 --> 17:39.649
- This changes nothing!
- Lemon, I am hemorrhaging money right now.

17:39.717 --> 17:41.384
Your audience has spent the last hour

17:41.453 --> 17:44.400
listening to Kenneth tell cleaned-up
versions of Garrison Keillor stories.

17:44.435 --> 17:47.593
Now, I understand
performer Liz is freaking out,

17:47.660 --> 17:49.260
So I need regular Liz's help.

17:49.328 --> 17:52.897
- I don't know that she's here right now.
- Lemon, I need regular Liz

17:52.965 --> 17:54.865
to tell that crazy bitch,
performer Liz,

17:54.934 --> 17:56.467
to get out on the stage
and give me something

17:56.535 --> 17:59.137
I can try to make money off of.
Please.

18:03.344 --> 18:08.880
Hey, buddy, your hair looks nice.
Don't try those tricks on me!

18:08.948 --> 18:12.650
- Oh, boy.
- Okay, I know that it's been a hard day.

I agree.
I'm sorry that I ruined-

20:06.566 --> 20:09.067
You didn't.
I sold the opening titles.

20:09.136 --> 20:10.761
- Really? To who?
- "Whom?"

20:10.796 --> 20:13.265
And from now on,
whenever a television is on

20:13.300 --> 20:15.842
in the background of a
Sheinhardt-Universal soap opera,

20:15.910 --> 20:20.145
- You will be on it.
- I'm gonna be on TV on TV!

20:21.415 --> 20:23.582
You're back!
Thank god.

20:23.650 --> 20:28.087

Don't ever leave me again!

Hey, fancy face.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.919
You scared me.
I thought I was gonna lose you.

20:43.986 --> 20:48.089
- You can't get rid of me that easily.
- That's me.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.761
- My wedding ring.
- I found it on the beach.

20:53.831 --> 20:54.996
That's me again.

21:00.069 --> 21:02.002
