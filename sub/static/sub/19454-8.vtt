00:00.000 --> 00:03.035
Previously on

00:03.037 --> 00:04.503
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

00:04.505 --> 00:06.905
<i>I am launching my first-ever</i>

00:06.907 --> 00:09.475
<i>makeup line, and I need you</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:10.642
<i>to market it.</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:16.515
<i>You'll be working in pairs.</i>
<i> We're too busy painting</i>
<i>our own faces instead of theirs.</i>

00:16.517 --> 00:21.453
<i> A sickening sweep of blush</i>
<i>helps distract from</i>
<i>unsightly scars.</i>

00:21.455 --> 00:27.259
<i> Ben de LA, we're hiding</i>
<i>behind another costume.</i>
<i>I have no idea who you are.</i>

00:27.261 --> 00:30.796
<i>Laganja, the crotch</i>
<i>is a little low.</i>
<i>Your hair is uneven.</i>

00:30.798 --> 00:34.299
<i>It's flopping.</i>
<i> We've got, like,</i>
<i>a little sister vibe going.</i>

00:34.301 --> 00:36.668
<i>She's the little sister.</i>
<i> I'm the low-rent version</i>
<i>of Courtney.</i>

00:36.670 --> 00:41.640
<i> I may have used that term</i>
<i>once.</i>
<i> Adore and Laganja, you're the</i>

00:41.642 --> 00:47.312
<i>winner of this week's challenge.</i>
<i> Darienne Lake, shante,</i>
<i>you stay.</i>

00:47.314 --> 00:51.984
<i>Ben de LA creme,</i>
<i>your time here</i>
<i>is not over.</i>

00:51.986 --> 00:55.387
<i>Shante, you stay.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> Whoo-oo!</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:57.456
<i>[Applause]</i>

00:57.458 --> 01:04.263
<i> Oh, whew.</i>

01:04.265 --> 01:05.130
<i> Well, that was something.</i>

01:05.132 --> 01:05.864
<i>I'm glad we didn't have</i>

01:05.866 --> 01:06.665
<i>to go home.</i>

01:06.667 --> 01:08.767
<i> Me too.</i>

01:08.769 --> 01:10.135
<i>I have no words.</i>

01:10.137 --> 01:11.203
<i>[Laughs]</i>

01:11.205 --> 01:13.972
<i>I'm so scared that I came that</i>

01:13.974 --> 01:18.544
<i>close to leaving so soon.</i>

01:18.546 --> 01:20.112
<i>[Sighs]</i>

01:20.114 --> 01:25.684
<i>Well, I thank everyone who</i>
<i>gasped in the background</i>
<i>when I didn't look</i>

01:25.686 --> 01:29.655
<i>like I was staying.</i>
<i>Appreciated that.</i>
<i> I was gonna cause a riot</i>

01:29.657 --> 01:34.193
<i>if she sent you home.</i>
<i>I was like, "no, you've made</i>
<i>the wrong decision."</i>

01:34.195 --> 01:36.628
<i>[Record scratches]</i>

01:36.630 --> 01:43.969
<i> Are you not gonna</i>
<i>congratulate Adore and I?</i>
<i>Do you think that we didn't</i>

01:43.971 --> 01:48.273
<i>deserve to win as a team?</i>
<i> I didn't think that</i>
<i>you should have won.</i>

01:48.275 --> 01:49.274
<i> I'm sure many of my</i>

01:49.276 --> 01:50.442
<i>competitors felt that Adore</i>

01:50.444 --> 01:52.211
<i>carried me for this win, but at</i>

01:52.213 --> 01:53.345
<i>the end of the day, she's</i>

01:53.347 --> 01:54.546
<i>standing in an 80s sweater and</i>

01:54.548 --> 01:56.949
<i>a skirt from forever 21, and I</i>

01:56.951 --> 01:59.017
<i>spent a lot of time on my look.</i>

01:59.019 --> 02:06.391
<i> Joslyn, I mean,</i>
<i>you're being very quiet.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

02:06.393 --> 02:10.929
<i> Tonight in the silver lounge,</i>
<i>Courtney read my look.</i>
<i> I just think that your drag</i>

02:10.931 --> 02:16.902
<i>isn't as polished as the other</i>
<i>drag in the competition</i>
<i>right now.</i>

02:16.904 --> 02:19.238
<i> Do you guys really feel like</i>
<i>i shouldn't be here?</i>
<i> No, no, no, not at all.</i>

02:19.240 --> 02:21.974
<i> I think you deserve</i>
<i>to be here.</i>
<i> I do feel that the look</i>

02:21.976 --> 02:28.947
<i>tonight wasn't executed as well</i>
<i>as the vision in your head,</i>
<i>but if you want anything, I got</i>

02:28.949 --> 02:35.954
<i>a whole box full of shit.</i>
<i> I've got a whole rack</i>
<i>of things.</i>

02:35.956 --> 02:38.090
<i> I've been doing drag for 13</i>

02:38.092 --> 02:40.225
<i>years, and I'm not being mean.</i>

02:40.227 --> 02:42.094
<i>I'm just being factual.</i>

02:42.096 --> 02:43.662
<i>But I didn't mean it in any way</i>

02:43.664 --> 02:45.197
<i>to hurt her feelings.</i>

02:45.199 --> 02:49.134
<i>I don't want you to think that</i>
<i>i was saying that you weren't</i>
<i>deserving of being</i>

02:49.136 --> 02:53.438
<i>in the competition.</i>
<i> I think because I have such</i>
<i>a big respect for you, it makes</i>

02:53.440 --> 02:58.944
<i>me feel bad about myself.</i>
<i>Like, I need you to understand,</i>
<i>like, that hurt me really bad.</i>

02:58.946 --> 03:02.981
<i>Nothing else has hurt me since</i>
<i>I've been in this competition</i>
<i>than when you told me that</i>

03:02.983 --> 03:08.053
<i>i looked unpolished.</i>
<i> If you need any help or</i>
<i>anything, I'm just trying to</i>

03:08.055 --> 03:13.358
<i>offer a hand because I would</i>
<i>like to see you do even better.</i>
<i> No, and I appreciate you</i>

03:13.360 --> 03:17.129
<i>offering me help, but I just--</i>
<i>i can't help but take it</i>
<i>as patronizing almost.</i>

03:17.131 --> 03:20.732
<i> Well, I mean, I guess it is</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

03:20.734 --> 03:21.833
<i> At this point, I don't know</i>

03:21.835 --> 03:22.634
<i>if I look up to Courtney</i>

03:22.636 --> 03:23.569
<i>as much.</i>

03:23.571 --> 03:27.873
<i>This is not about making</i>
<i>friends.</i>
<i>Now it's game on.</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:34.813
<i> </i> <i>RuPaul Drag Race</i>
the winner of <i>RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i> receives

03:34.815 --> 03:41.220
a sickening supply of
Colorevolution cosmetics
and a cash prize of $100,000.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.957
With extra special guest judges
Bruce vilanch
and jaime pressly.

03:44.959 --> 03:49.895
<i>RuPaul Drag Race</i>
may the best woman
best woman win

03:49.897 --> 03:57.169
come on, cloud nine realness.
Yeah.
I'm still here.

03:57.171 --> 04:02.341
Yay!
I am really excited for a new
day, a new challenge, a new

04:02.343 --> 04:06.945
chance to prove myself.
And then there were eight.
Again.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.882
[Harshly lilting] Okay.
You can roll your eyes, mama.
Okay, you know what?

04:10.884 --> 04:15.187
I'm not your mama.
My name is Bianca.
Laganja's feeling her fantasy.

04:15.189 --> 04:15.954
"Yes, fierce.

04:15.956 --> 04:16.622
Yes, mama.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.289
Blah, blah, blah."

04:17.291 --> 04:18.290
No, I'm over it.

04:18.292 --> 04:18.957
[Shemail alert wails]

04:18.959 --> 04:20.959
Ooh!
Thank you, Jesus.
[Laughter]

04:20.961 --> 04:26.632
Let's roll, mama.
You've got shemail.
Hey, you crazy characters.

04:26.634 --> 04:32.938
Now, to become America's next
drag superstar, just do you,
but be careful,

04:32.940 --> 04:40.812
because if you do you too often,
you might just go blind.
It's not funny!

04:40.814 --> 04:45.684
This one's got me stumped.
Hello, hello, hello.
All: Hi.

04:45.686 --> 04:51.523
Hi.
Now, America's next drag
superstar has to look sickening

04:51.525 --> 04:57.362
from every angle.
So for today's mini challenge,
you'll be lip-synching upside

04:57.364 --> 05:02.134
down and lying on your back...
Oh, God.
Which I'm sure

05:02.136 --> 05:04.970
you've all done before.
[Laughter]
Okay.

05:04.972 --> 05:09.775
[In singsong voice] Oh,
scruff pit crew.
[Contestants grunting

05:09.777 --> 05:14.613
rhythmically]
Where are they?
Oh, they're only 20 feet away

05:14.615 --> 05:17.549
from my current location.
[Laughter]
Oh.

05:17.551 --> 05:22.521
All: Oh.
Well, hello.
Using the materials provided,

05:22.523 --> 05:25.657
you'll need to drag up
your chin...
Ah!

05:25.659 --> 05:28.827
Like it's your face.
Yay.
[Laughs]

05:28.829 --> 05:37.202
Ready, set, go.
[Pop music]

05:37.204 --> 05:42.607
First, Bianca Del Rio.
[Applause]
Chin up, Bianca.

05:42.609 --> 05:45.977
[Laughs]
Hit it.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.079
I'm fed up

05:47.081 --> 05:47.813
with a stupid world

05:47.815 --> 05:49.881
[laughing]

05:49.883 --> 05:51.249
Where's my dummy gun

05:51.251 --> 05:52.184
shoot 'em up

05:52.186 --> 05:53.318
bang, bang, bang

05:53.320 --> 05:57.289
I say we forget the noise

05:57.291 --> 05:58.056
take 'em one by one

05:58.058 --> 05:58.724
[laughter]

05:58.726 --> 05:59.691
Get it done

05:59.693 --> 06:01.093
hey, hey, hey

06:01.095 --> 06:02.461
high society

06:02.463 --> 06:03.161
better when

06:03.163 --> 06:04.663
we're left alone

06:04.665 --> 06:06.131
the hypocrisy

06:06.133 --> 06:07.299
saying that you will

06:07.301 --> 06:08.600
but you won't

06:08.602 --> 06:09.868
the audacity

06:09.870 --> 06:10.602
tell us that

06:10.604 --> 06:12.204
our love is wrong

06:12.206 --> 06:13.538
get your rebel on

06:13.540 --> 06:14.906
oh, oh, oh

06:14.908 --> 06:16.341
so stand up

06:16.343 --> 06:17.509
Trinity's chin looks like

06:17.511 --> 06:18.510
Vivacious.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.678
It's so funny.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.512
[Laughs]

06:20.514 --> 06:22.247
How you want to love

06:22.249 --> 06:23.982
and raise your voices

06:23.984 --> 06:25.851
sing a battle song

06:25.853 --> 06:27.619
a revolution

06:27.621 --> 06:28.787
get your rebel on

06:28.789 --> 06:33.291
[laughing]

06:33.293 --> 06:39.598
One of you stood out by
the hair piece on your
chin-y chin chin.

06:39.600 --> 06:45.370
Joslyn Fox.
[Applause]
Condragulations,

06:45.372 --> 06:47.572
the fox that rocks.
Thank you, Ru.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.641
Now, ladies, for today's main

06:49.643 --> 06:51.977
challenge, you'll be performing

06:51.979 --> 06:53.712
a good old-fashioned

06:53.714 --> 06:55.781
comedy show,

06:55.783 --> 06:58.784
#dragqueensofcomedy.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.685
Each of you needs to write and

07:00.687 --> 07:03.355
perform a stand-up comedy.

07:03.357 --> 07:09.060
Hurricane Bianca's in town.
No one is safe.
Now, joslyn, since you won

07:09.062 --> 07:15.500
the mini challenge, you get to
pick the order of the lineup.
Now, I want you to use your

07:15.502 --> 07:22.541
charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and
talent to tickle my funny bone.
It's right here where my rib

07:22.543 --> 07:26.178
used to be.
[Laughter]
So, gentlemen,

07:26.180 --> 07:31.950
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
All right, let's do this,

07:31.952 --> 07:34.019
ladies.

07:34.021 --> 07:42.194
All right.
"Courtney is an asshole."
Oh, my God, now, that's

07:42.196 --> 07:45.130
a guaranteed laugh.
[Laughs]
Are there two "r"s

07:45.132 --> 07:47.499
in your name?
Why, are you making jokes
about me?

07:47.501 --> 07:50.735
No, I'm just making a list of
all the girls so I can think
about the order

07:50.737 --> 07:53.338
I'ma put you all in.
So here's what you do,
joslyn.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.842
You put Bianca on first, and
then whoever you want to throw
under the bus you put second.

07:56.844 --> 08:00.879
[Laughs]
Then you put me second last
and you last.

08:00.881 --> 08:04.749
That's just shady.
Yesterday you were suggesting
that her drag was ugly.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.352
Today you're telling her
how to do a lineup.
Yeah, isn't that funny?

08:07.354 --> 08:11.456
You are a shady cunt.
Love you, joslyn.

08:11.458 --> 08:31.676
[Quirky music]
[Mouthing words]

08:31.678 --> 08:35.180
De LA's really freaking
me out right now.
This bitch is talking

08:35.182 --> 08:37.482
I was like, "bitch, I thought I

08:37.484 --> 08:39.818
was the crazy one up in here."

08:39.820 --> 08:44.456
What do you have,
Ben de LA?
I think that I'm gonna go

08:44.458 --> 08:47.792
with something that's sort of
more a blanket personal
narrative.

08:47.794 --> 08:54.299
[Laughing]
Knee-slapper.

08:54.301 --> 08:58.370
I get to decide the order

08:58.372 --> 08:59.971
the girls perform in.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.674
First up, opening the show...

09:02.676 --> 09:06.578
[Laughs]

09:06.580 --> 09:15.420
[Laughs]
Today we're getting ready for
our stand-up comedy routine

09:15.422 --> 09:19.424
this is definitely one of the

09:19.426 --> 09:20.592
hardest challenges of the

09:20.594 --> 09:22.127
competition so far.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.797
Adore, are you gonna write
material, or are you just gonna
write a card for guidelines

09:25.799 --> 09:30.268
saying "cool, awesome, chola,
my mom, libra?"
"Party."

09:30.270 --> 09:32.571
"Party."
[Laughs]
Fuck off.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.639
Fuck all the way off.

09:34.641 --> 09:42.314
Shit.
So what are you
gonna do, jos?

09:42.316 --> 09:45.917
Have you got any ideas?
When I wait tables, like,
that's, like, my opportunity to

09:45.919 --> 09:49.421
be a stand-up comedian,
so I'm always cracking jokes.
If somebody orders a jumbo

09:49.423 --> 09:53.191
shrimp cocktail, I'll say,
"I hope you're not allergic."
And they'll say, "to what?"

09:53.193 --> 09:59.698
And I'll say, "to an oxymoron."
Jumbo shrimp.
Pregnant pause.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.900
Pregnant pause.
[Laughs]

10:01.902 --> 10:03.335
I know that stand-up comedy

10:03.337 --> 10:06.237
is not my cup of soup--

10:06.239 --> 10:06.938
cup of tea--

10:06.940 --> 10:08.506
cup of bowl of what?

10:08.508 --> 10:12.444
Cup of tea.
This is not my cup of tea.
[Laughs]

10:12.446 --> 10:15.580
Where did--
where did Laganja go?
I don't know.

10:15.582 --> 10:21.720
Laganja, are you here?
Oh, oh, well.
Yes, girl.

10:21.722 --> 10:27.125
Okay.
I love it.
She's under the table.

10:27.127 --> 10:32.731
How y'all doing?
Oh, let me get more attention
like the big no-smoking sign

10:32.733 --> 10:34.933
on my head.
Let me get under a table.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.434
Really, queen?

10:36.436 --> 10:42.474
My name is miss Laganja
Estranja, but you can call me
miss Mary Jane, little miss 420,

10:42.476 --> 10:45.844
or for my Latin folk in the
audience, LA marijuana.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.245
I think in this competition

10:47.247 --> 10:48.813
you have to stand out

10:48.815 --> 10:50.115
and be a bold character.

10:50.117 --> 10:54.753
This is the perfect challenge
to showcase Laganja.
Honey, I am gonna give you

10:54.755 --> 11:00.825
stoner realness.
Now, girl, if it ain't green,
well, girl, I'm not interested.

11:00.827 --> 11:05.430
I need a transition.
The judges say that
I'm hiding behind a character,

11:05.432 --> 11:11.569
but I think Laganja is maybe
the person who's actually afraid
to be exposed right now.

11:11.571 --> 11:15.173
How you doing, de LA?
Oh, I'm plugging away.
How are you?

11:15.175 --> 11:19.744
Girl, I'm just trying to,
you know, remember what it was
like to be in a tent and just,

11:19.746 --> 11:23.148
you know, really channel
that inner child.
Okay.

11:23.150 --> 11:27.786
This person is not the
Laganja that I know, and it's
freaking me the hell out.

11:27.788 --> 11:33.658
Okay?
Hello, hello, hello.
All: Hi.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.429
How are my drag queens
of comedy?
Hilarious.

11:37.431 --> 11:41.766
Yuck-a, yuck-a, yuck.
[Laughs]
Hey, de LA.

11:41.768 --> 11:45.070
Hi, Ru.
Now, last week you were
in the bottom two.

11:45.072 --> 11:48.339
Yes, I was.
Do you feel a lot of pressure
to bounce back from all that?

11:48.341 --> 11:53.411
I definitely do.
Yeah, I was really devastated
to be down there.

11:53.413 --> 11:59.050
What are you the most
nervous about?
I, you know, don't have

11:59.052 --> 12:02.554
zingy one-liners.
I consider my humor
to be very character-based.

12:02.556 --> 12:07.592
You know, there was the note
from Michelle that she didn't
know who you are,

12:07.594 --> 12:10.495
because you do a character.
Yeah.
But on an emotional level,

12:10.497 --> 12:14.199
that that wasn't coming through.
But I also feel like this is
the perfect challenge for me to

12:14.201 --> 12:17.969
have the opportunity to do that.
Well, I look forward to it.
Get back to work.

12:17.971 --> 12:22.273
Thank you, Ru.
All right.
Well, hello, miss Bianca.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.877
Hi.
Everyone's looking to you
to be the standout

12:25.879 --> 12:29.748
in this challenge.
Does that make you nervous?
Concerned, yeah.

12:29.750 --> 12:33.318
But you're very funny.
But for me, it's more
observations and in the moment,

12:33.320 --> 12:37.155
and I don't do well with
sitting down and writing,
"here is a joke."

12:37.157 --> 12:40.825
Now, in the past, you've
actually helped a lot of queens
in this competition.

12:40.827 --> 12:43.828
Yeah.
Who's helping you out?
Well, they're all helping me

12:43.830 --> 12:46.664
out by being horrible
and making me look better.
[Laughs]

12:46.666 --> 12:48.967
And I'm not just a nasty
fuck.
I will help them pack

12:48.969 --> 12:52.437
to go home.
[Laughter]
I mean, you don't even got to

12:52.439 --> 12:55.640
fold some of the shit
they're wearing.
You just ball it up.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.409
"Put that in bag number five,
bitch.
Get to stepping."

12:58.411 --> 13:01.479
All right, see you out there.
Thank you.
This challenge is really

13:01.481 --> 13:06.251
a shit-or-get-off-the-pot
moment, so let's hope
I can deliver a nice, big turd.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.687
Trinity K. Bonet,
hey, mama.
Hi.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.290
Have you ever done stand-up
before?
No.

13:12.292 --> 13:19.130
Do you know any jokes?
I can't tell you exactly what
it's gonna be right now,

13:19.132 --> 13:22.767
but when I feel like I have
a magnifying glass over me
or something,

13:22.769 --> 13:28.173
that's when it gets hard.
I know what
you're capable of.

13:28.175 --> 13:33.244
In the last challenge,
your comedy came out, but it's
interesting that almost by habit

13:33.246 --> 13:36.281
you shut down.
I don't know.
It's just almost something

13:36.283 --> 13:39.884
I can't control.
You just--you are who you are.
I know that there's

13:39.886 --> 13:44.389
a block there,
and so that's for you to unlock.
Don't let the moment

13:44.391 --> 13:48.326
pass you by.
All right, Trinity,
I'm counting on you.

13:48.328 --> 13:53.498
Ru is counting on me to
deliver something that he know
damn well I can't do.

13:53.500 --> 14:01.139
All right, ladies,
gather round.
To prove that your comedy has

14:01.141 --> 14:07.712
a broad appeal, I've invited
a senior citizens group
to join us.

14:07.714 --> 14:13.818
Yes, they will be sitting
front and center.
I told you it was gonna be

14:13.820 --> 14:19.924
an old-fashioned comedy show.
Make 'em laugh.
Anyone close to me knows that

14:19.926 --> 14:24.062
cock, bitch, fuck, damn,
shit, and ass
are my favorite words to use.

14:24.064 --> 14:29.367
[Laughs]
I'm fucked.
Gentlemen,

14:29.369 --> 14:34.172
start your engines...
[In slurred, aged voice]
And may the best woman win.

14:34.174 --> 14:45.516
So is anyone curious as to
the order I've put us all in?
Ooh, yes.

14:45.518 --> 14:49.053
Oh, God.
Because I won the mini
challenge today, I get to decide

14:49.055 --> 14:56.227
the order that the girls perform
in for the comedy show.
Okay, now, first up, we will

14:56.229 --> 15:01.666
be opening the show with
none other than the incomparable
Darienne Lake.

15:01.668 --> 15:06.504
All: Yay.
[Applause]
Following Darienne is

15:06.506 --> 15:10.642
joslyn is a shady

15:10.644 --> 15:11.676
little character.

15:11.678 --> 15:15.980
[Chuckles]
She's dumb like a fox, but
because I'm following Darienne,

15:15.982 --> 15:19.350
I have to make sure that
I'm very funny.
And Courtney will be

15:19.352 --> 15:23.788
introducing our third performer,
Adore.
Yes.

15:23.790 --> 15:27.458
Following Adore will be
miss Ben de LA creme.
All right.

15:27.460 --> 15:32.230
And then in our fifth slot,
it's Laganja Estranja.
Ooh.

15:32.232 --> 15:36.734
After Laganja will be
miss Trinity K. Bonet.
Following Trinity will be the

15:36.736 --> 15:40.772
funniest girl of the whole bit,
Ms. joslyn f--
oh, that's me.

15:40.774 --> 15:44.509
[Laughter]
And then closing the show
will be the oldest

15:44.511 --> 15:47.712
of all the queens...
[Laughs]
Miss Bianca Del Rio.

15:47.714 --> 15:52.150
Yeah.
Let's hope I can stay awake
till I go on.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.252
[Cheers and applause]

15:54.254 --> 15:55.386
I know we got some old people

15:55.388 --> 15:57.288
here in the audience tonight.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.656
Yeah, did you guys all

15:58.658 --> 16:00.725
come together on the ark?

16:00.727 --> 16:04.629
[Laughs]

16:04.631 --> 16:08.466
[Laughs]

16:08.468 --> 16:14.038
I am sparkle toss.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.240
It's comedy.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.108
Today we have to do

16:17.110 --> 16:18.476
a stand-up routine in front of

16:18.478 --> 16:19.444
a live audience.

16:19.446 --> 16:23.881
I've never done one, let alone
in front of the elderly.
For me, this is the type of

16:23.883 --> 16:28.686
challenge that's probably--
it's gonna be rough.
So josy Jo-sticks,

16:28.688 --> 16:32.557
do you have any old people
that you relate to?
I'm very close with my

16:32.559 --> 16:36.327
grandparents, and they've always
been very supportive of me.
Oh, that's cool.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.897
And my grandfather was,
you know, always my biggest fan.
Aw.

16:39.899 --> 16:45.470
And I remember, he had read
about a Broadway star.
She was up for her first Tony.

16:45.472 --> 16:50.508
Then she overheard some of the
other nominees saying how big of
a joke she was and that she

16:50.510 --> 16:53.611
didn't deserve to be nominated,
and there's no way she was going
to win.

16:53.613 --> 16:57.782
And she said she got really down
on herself and went back out
there completely feeling

16:57.784 --> 17:02.587
defeated, and then she won
the Tony.
I remember him bringing me

17:02.589 --> 17:06.257
that article and saying,
"you can be that same person.
You have what it takes."

17:06.259 --> 17:12.163
This is kind of like my f.U.
To all the people who thought
I couldn't succeed in it.

17:12.165 --> 17:17.702
And I just--I can't wait to hear
what he has to say, 'cause
I know he'll be prouder

17:17.704 --> 17:20.705
than anyone else.
Oh, that's nice.

17:20.707 --> 17:26.711
Bianca, you have any worries
at all?
I don't fucking

17:26.713 --> 17:29.647
know, you know.
What's your worst nightmare
of going out there?

17:29.649 --> 17:32.984
My worst nightmare is sitting
next to you like we are now.
[Gasps]

17:32.986 --> 17:37.021
[Laughter]
You're, like, evil nice.
Like, what's with that?

17:37.023 --> 17:40.825
Like, you can't hate you 'cause
you're helpful, and you're
sweet, but you're truthful.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.661
But you're a dick.
Now, if you'd said this
on day one, I would have been

17:43.663 --> 17:47.065
your friend.
It's amazing we get this close,
and you're leaving today.

17:47.067 --> 17:52.070
What?
[Laughs]
I fucking hate you.

17:52.072 --> 18:04.215
[Pop music]
[Laughing]

18:04.217 --> 18:11.122
Cover girl
put the bass in your walk

18:11.124 --> 18:17.929
head to toe
let your whole body talk
and what?

18:17.931 --> 18:23.034
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's chuckle hut.
[Laughter]

18:23.036 --> 18:25.369
L.O.L., it's Michelle Visage.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.672
The fierce flower is clearly

18:27.674 --> 18:28.873
in bloom tonight.

18:28.875 --> 18:29.941
[Laughs]

18:29.943 --> 18:31.876
My favorite straight man,

18:31.878 --> 18:33.177
Santino Rice.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.212
[Laughs]

18:34.214 --> 18:36.047
Blooming gorgeous, Ru.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.516
Comedy legend, Bruce vilanch.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.350
I'm gonna come over

18:39.352 --> 18:40.384
and pollinate you.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.019
[Laughter]

18:42.021 --> 18:43.488
I thought you'd never ask.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.089
And jaime pressly.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.023
Hello.

18:46.025 --> 18:48.159
How can one person be so

18:48.161 --> 18:51.095
beautiful and so funny?

18:51.097 --> 18:54.332
I'm talking about myself.
Clearly.
[Laughter]

18:54.334 --> 18:58.369
J.K., miss thing.
We are so happy
to have you here.

18:58.371 --> 19:03.374
This week we challenged
our queens to put on a good
old-fashioned comedy show,

19:03.376 --> 19:09.413
and boy, are my arms tired.
[Laughter]
Gentlemen, start your engines,

19:09.415 --> 19:18.923
and may the best woman win.
The drag queens of comedy.
[Cheers and applause]

19:18.925 --> 19:27.064
Hey.
My name is miss Darienne Lake.
I like to say miss 'cause it

19:27.066 --> 19:31.869
lets the boys know I'm single,
you know.
Of course, my 14 cats

19:31.871 --> 19:36.807
and my appearance on
<i>hoarders: Buried alive</i> might
also let them know I'm single.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.311
I asked my mother--I'm like,
"mom, how did I end up
so twisted?

19:40.313 --> 19:43.814
Like, did you, like, drop me on
my head when I was a baby?"
She was like,

19:43.816 --> 19:50.121
"honey, you have to be
held to be dropped."
[Laughter]

19:50.123 --> 19:56.127
Well, I am here representing
all the big and curvy girls.
Hey.

19:56.129 --> 19:59.830
I'm trying to get in shape.
I mean--well, round is a shape,
you know.

19:59.832 --> 20:05.770
[Laughter]
At the gym, I'm like a ninja.
You will never see me there.

20:05.772 --> 20:11.275
[Laughter]
I know we got some old people
here in the audience tonight.

20:11.277 --> 20:14.412
Yes, how y'all doing?
[Cheers and applause]
Yeah, did you guys all come

20:14.414 --> 20:17.815
together
on the ark?
[Laughter]

20:17.817 --> 20:26.691
Tell Noah I said hello.
As you may have all gathered
from my accent, I am from Idaho.

20:26.693 --> 20:31.128
[Laughter]
I'm kidding.
I'm from Australia, land of

20:31.130 --> 20:36.367
kangaroos, land of Olivia Newton
John, and throwing all the
shrimp on the Barbie.

20:36.369 --> 20:40.037
Yeah.
Well, what if I don't want
shrimp thrown on me?

20:40.039 --> 20:43.541
[Laughter]
I want to look fishy,
not smell fishy.

20:43.543 --> 20:51.182
[Laughter]
So I moved to America recently.
I moved to west Hollywood, and

20:51.184 --> 20:54.852
I've written a little bit of a
song about some of the people
that I've met there, and I'd

20:54.854 --> 21:00.925
like to sing it for you now.
They'll take you down
with just one look

21:00.927 --> 21:05.863
they hunt in packs
they don't read books
injectable tans

21:05.865 --> 21:11.936
and no tattoos
too young for Botox
got nothing to lose

21:11.938 --> 21:16.707
they're the mean gays
they live in west Hollywood
they're the mean gays

21:16.709 --> 21:19.877
well, they would
if they could
I'm a mean gay

21:19.879 --> 21:22.546
well, you would
if you could
I might look nice

21:22.548 --> 21:26.951
but do think twice
before you take me on
[Cheers and applause]

21:26.953 --> 21:32.823
Thank you.
Hi, you're probably wondering
why I look like a Mexican Katy

21:32.825 --> 21:36.427
Perry right now, aren't you?
My mother is a chola.
Do you guys know what

21:36.429 --> 21:40.231
a chola is?
Can I get a show of hands?
Yeah, we're in L.A.,

21:40.233 --> 21:44.935
motherfucker.
[Laughter]
Yeah, my mom's a chola,

21:44.937 --> 21:50.708
and she likes big cocks.
Okay, no, yeah, I was really
scared when I heard that senior

21:50.710 --> 21:55.646
citizens were gonna be in the
fucking audience tonight, okay?
Just blame my fucking grandma

21:55.648 --> 21:58.716
because she likes to go to
t.J. And get work done, so I
never grasped the concept

21:58.718 --> 22:03.120
to respect my elders.
The bitch never ages.
She has a fake ass and a fake

22:03.122 --> 22:06.824
hip, and I'm pretty sure the ass
came first and broke the hip,
so I don't know what the hell

22:06.826 --> 22:09.794
she's doing.
But anyways, my grandma's
a whore.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.263
No?
Cool.
It's my first time, people.

22:12.265 --> 22:16.767
[Laughs]
You guys having fun?
[Cheers and applause]

22:16.769 --> 22:22.740
I'll mow your lawns later.
My name is Ben de LA creme.
Hold for applause.

22:22.742 --> 22:28.045
'Kay.
And I'm delighted to be
here with a live audience.

22:28.047 --> 22:31.849
I love it when there's people
just right in front of me,
and I can feel like I can just

22:31.851 --> 22:34.352
reach right out and touch you
if I wanted to.
I don't want to.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.788
Don't worry about that.
But I feel like I could if I
wanted to, which is a great

22:37.790 --> 22:42.760
option to have.
I'm far away from my home town
of Seattle, Washington.

22:42.762 --> 22:47.498
It's the city that never dries,
but, you know, it's--
rain is not so bad.

22:47.500 --> 22:52.636
It is a moist area,
but it's my moist area.
And I love it.

22:52.638 --> 22:56.374
A lot of people come there.
You just need to wear the right
protection, you know.

22:56.376 --> 23:01.412
There's a lot of stereotypes
about Seattle-ites, but they're
really just regular folk,

23:01.414 --> 23:06.517
extremely regular folk.
You know, caffeine--all in
line for the restroom.

23:06.519 --> 23:12.289
We love a good rest, but, um--
I digress.
The point is, I feel like I've

23:12.291 --> 23:18.529
learned to sort of weave a
story, bring somebody on an arc
that really ends somewhere where

23:18.531 --> 23:23.868
they feel like the whole thing's
been meaningful, and they're
gonna wind up with something

23:23.870 --> 23:28.539
that made the whole thing
worthwhile.
So tell us a joke.

23:28.541 --> 23:34.178
[Audience murmuring]
Um, good night, everybody.
[Scattered applause]

23:34.180 --> 23:36.247
Wow.

23:36.249 --> 23:46.724
[Laughs]
[Cheers and applause]
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

23:46.726 --> 23:52.296
put your lighters up.
Ganja's in the house.
Yeah.

23:52.298 --> 23:57.435
As you could tell from my
accent, I am from Dallas,
Tex-ass, and it was not very

23:57.437 --> 24:03.007
easy growing up looking like
this, whether I was playing in
my grandma's clothes or putting

24:03.009 --> 24:07.111
on a show for my well-organized,
alphabetically-ordered
beanie babies.

24:07.113 --> 24:14.084
I was ga-ga-ga-gay, okay?
But it wasn't until I moved
to Los Angeles that

24:14.086 --> 24:19.323
I discovered marijuana.
I mean, I like to smoke.
Y'all, I am just flying as high

24:19.325 --> 24:24.128
as your receding hairline, okay?
[Audience grumbling]
Marijuana really does help me

24:24.130 --> 24:28.132
calm down.
So, y'all, I went to valencia
where they film

24:28.134 --> 24:32.770
the TV show <i>weeds.</i>
<i>Now, y'all, it's very dry.</i>
<i>It's almost kind of like</i>

24:32.772 --> 24:37.208
<i>your vagina.</i>
<i>[Audience grumbling]</i>
<i>can I get a amen?</i>

24:37.210 --> 24:45.416
<i>Now, y'all, I am a tree hugger</i>
<i>because if it ain't green, ha,</i>
<i>I'm not interested, okay?</i>

24:45.418 --> 24:48.052
<i>[Scattered applause]</i>

24:48.054 --> 24:54.391
<i> Get up and show me some love.</i>
<i>Come on, get up.</i>
<i>Show me some love.</i>

24:54.393 --> 24:57.428
<i>Get up.</i>
<i>I got on all this shit,</i>
<i>all this drag.</i>

24:57.430 --> 25:00.130
<i>This stuff is hot.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:00.132 --> 25:02.433
<i>This ain't easy.</i>
<i>I'm not a comedian.</i>
<i>So--go on, sit down.</i>

25:02.435 --> 25:05.169
<i>Sit down. Sit down.</i>
<i>Sit down shit shit.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

25:05.171 --> 25:09.306
<i>Sit down.</i>
<i>So if you all have not already</i>
<i>noticed, I am black,</i>

25:09.308 --> 25:11.876
<i>but don't be worried, you know,</i>
<i>you don't have to hold on to</i>
<i>your purses and your wallets.</i>

25:11.878 --> 25:15.746
<i>I already got 'em.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>growing up for me was</i>

25:15.748 --> 25:18.916
<i>really hard because we were</i>
<i>really poor.</i>
<i>We were, like,</i> <i>good times</i> poor.

25:18.918 --> 25:23.187
[Laughs]
It was really, really bad.
And the only way we had the

25:23.189 --> 25:27.224
opportunity to eat was,
my mother would read us recipes
from a cookbook.

25:27.226 --> 25:33.964
[Laughter]
And, oh, how I got full many
nights off of the roast beef

25:33.966 --> 25:38.168
on page 27.
[Laughter]
But a really unfortunate

25:38.170 --> 25:40.404
thing happened.
My sister caught a
ear infection, so she

25:40.406 --> 25:45.009
starved to death.
[Laughter]
I really grew up a lot

25:45.011 --> 25:47.745
with my grandmother.
I stayed at my grandmother's
house, one, because she was

25:47.747 --> 25:51.282
just a sweet lady, and two,
because she had food.
[Laughter]

25:51.284 --> 25:56.687
But she had this really crazy
obsession with her bills,
and it was the light bill

25:56.689 --> 25:59.356
in particular.
Everything involved
the light bill.

25:59.358 --> 26:02.026
[Strained, aged voice] "Stop
running around my house
like that.

26:02.028 --> 26:06.030
You gonna run my light bill up."
[Laughter]
"Stop flushing that toilet

26:06.032 --> 26:09.567
so much.
You gonna run my damn
light bill up.

26:09.569 --> 26:15.039
Stop breathing so much.
You gonna run my light bill up."
I just feel like I can be myself

26:15.041 --> 26:18.943
and just let my hair down
with all of you people.
Yeah.

26:18.945 --> 26:22.446
Oh!
[Laughter]
Good times. It's a party.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.783
It's a party.
Yes.
[Cheers and applause]

26:25.785 --> 26:30.654
You know, I've suffered
from adhd all of my life.
It's a constant struggle

26:30.656 --> 26:32.990
every day.
Aw.
[Laughs]

26:32.992 --> 26:36.827
Ooh, look, a rhinestone.
[Laughter]
But I'm always getting shit,

26:36.829 --> 26:39.930
you know.
"Oh, you're so skinny.
Why don't you just eat

26:39.932 --> 26:44.068
something,"
or, "eat a cheeseburger,
you skinny bitch."

26:44.070 --> 26:49.039
And all I want to say is, "well,
then give me something to eat.
I'm fucking starving.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.842
So I've got a little
theory going here.
Ever since I've come to the show

26:51.844 --> 26:55.913
and I met RuPaul, I have
a little theory here.
I'm gonna run it by you.

26:55.915 --> 27:00.918
I've seen RuPaul in the workroom
out of drag.
I see RuPaul here on the runway

27:00.920 --> 27:04.755
as a drag queen.
Never in the same room
at the same time.

27:04.757 --> 27:11.095
[Laughter]
Both rupauls--same person.
Pretty sure I cracked the code.

27:11.097 --> 27:15.933
Just saying.
[Cheers and applause]
I am so excited to see

27:15.935 --> 27:19.903
the cast of <i>cocoon</i> is here.
[Laughter]
You look fabulous.

27:19.905 --> 27:24.475
Miss, I'm over here.
Bring both eyes.
I'm right here.

27:24.477 --> 27:29.713
Damn, pearl harbor must have
did you in.
[Laughter]

27:29.715 --> 27:33.817
On a lighter note, I'd like to
let you know about my family.
My mother is from Cuba, and my

27:33.819 --> 27:37.287
dad is from Honduras, which
basically means I have
a large dick, no credit,

27:37.289 --> 27:42.226
and a tendency to take things
that don't belong to me.
[Laughter]

27:42.228 --> 27:49.500
My mother insisted that we stay
true to our Spanish heritage,
so my first words were,

27:49.502 --> 27:55.172
"housekeeping."
[Laughter]
I like the gentlemen in the back

27:55.174 --> 27:59.276
who's sleeping.
Makes me feel right at home.
Can you wake that bitch up?

27:59.278 --> 28:02.646
Yeah, the one right there
with the horizontal stripes.
Not a good look in your third

28:02.648 --> 28:07.451
trimester, sir, all right?
[Laughter]
All I've ever heard from the

28:07.453 --> 28:12.122
judges was that we need to see
more versatility.
You know what I got to say to

28:12.124 --> 28:16.760
y'all is that I will show you
versatility when Santino wins
a sewing competition and visage

28:16.762 --> 28:21.398
wears a fucking turtleneck,
you hear me?
[Laughter]

28:21.400 --> 28:26.870
Ain't gonna happen.
Well, I got to say, I hope you
guys had a lot of fun, and

28:26.872 --> 28:31.709
because I'm feeling extra
special, I'm gonna put fresh
tennis balls on every Walker

28:31.711 --> 28:35.746
in the place.
[Laughter]
Jell-o all around.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.248
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Muah.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.317
[Cheers and applause]

28:40.319 --> 28:43.654
I got zero funny from you.

28:43.656 --> 28:44.988
I just didn't think anything

28:44.990 --> 28:46.557
was really developed.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.392
That's the nightclub, girl.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.393
What we're telling you

28:49.395 --> 28:50.694
is what it takes.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.496
[Sniffles]

28:52.498 --> 28:54.565
[Laughs]

28:54.567 --> 29:01.572
[Laughs]
Welcome, ladies.
It's time for the judges'

29:01.574 --> 29:08.946
critiques.
First up, Darienne Lake.
You came out to the driest,

29:08.948 --> 29:13.517
coldest house imaginable.
You got them laughing.
You're amazing.

29:13.519 --> 29:17.855
Like, literally, my note
says, "killed it."
Thank you so much, Darienne.

29:17.857 --> 29:22.693
Next up, Courtney Act.
I thought you did okay,
but if you're gonna use a shtick

29:22.695 --> 29:26.797
like a song, that shit
had better be the funniest song
I've ever heard.

29:26.799 --> 29:30.467
Mm-hmm.
And it wasn't.
But you're not a stand-up

29:30.469 --> 29:35.672
comic, so I thought it was very
cleverly calculated to play
to your strengths.

29:35.674 --> 29:39.810
All right, next up,
Adore Delano.
I love the character.

29:39.812 --> 29:44.915
You had some funny jokes, but
don't just throw f-bombs around
Willy-nilly when they're not

29:44.917 --> 29:49.653
adding to the party.
You're relying a lot on
your charm and personality,

29:49.655 --> 29:55.759
which concerns me.
[Sniffles]
I'm really, really trying.

29:55.761 --> 30:02.065
I want to know that, like,
I'm here
because I deserve it.

30:02.067 --> 30:07.104
[Sniffles]
Adore, the charming thing is
a great plus, but you've got to

30:07.106 --> 30:12.509
have faith in your talent.
Thanks.
All right, let's move on.

30:12.511 --> 30:15.746
I'm kind of getting bored

30:15.748 --> 30:17.514
with these old showgirl looks.

30:17.516 --> 30:21.985
I actually chose this because
Michelle was saying that she'd
like to sort of see more me.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.755
I actually--
but it's got nothing to do
with your clothes, baby.

30:24.757 --> 30:29.126
It's stepping out of that
character and showing us
who you are inside.

30:29.128 --> 30:34.631
While you have intelligent
jokes, you didn't stop long
enough to let your crowd laugh

30:34.633 --> 30:40.470
or hear the joke.
Next up, Laganja Estranja.
Hey, hey, hey.

30:40.472 --> 30:46.844
I got zero funny from you.
You do this thing--this
[Harshly lilting] "okay, okay."

30:46.846 --> 30:52.783
I want you to strip down that
affected facade that is there,
and the few times that I've seen

30:52.785 --> 30:56.520
you not do that, I've started to
warm up to you.
Once you go into that...

30:56.522 --> 31:02.025
[Babbling]
Then we lose you.
Tonight wasn't a character,

31:02.027 --> 31:05.596
and I do--I do talk like that,
and I'm sorry you--
no, no, you talk like this.

31:05.598 --> 31:11.501
This is how you talk.
[Sighs]
I am trying tooth and nail

31:11.503 --> 31:14.605
to impress you guys.
You won the challenge
last week.

31:14.607 --> 31:17.274
But you know what?
It didn't feel like a win, Ru,
because all I could hear was,

31:17.276 --> 31:21.411
my crotch is too low,
my hair is off.
And I feel like an amateur up

31:21.413 --> 31:26.516
here, and I feel like I can
never do anything to please you.
And I do love myself, and I do

31:26.518 --> 31:30.254
believe I'm a superstar,
and I am fighting so hard
to prove that to you.

31:30.256 --> 31:34.091
And I've given up everything in
my life to be a drag queen,
and I'm--

31:34.093 --> 31:38.829
breathe, breathe.
We all do that ki ki voice.
It's a funny voice, but you

31:38.831 --> 31:41.698
can't do that all the time.
It's the same note we had for
Ben de LA creme.

31:41.700 --> 31:45.802
It separates you
from being human.
You know, in the real world,

31:45.804 --> 31:49.806
people love me, and they think
I'm such a performer, and they
love to come and see me.

31:49.808 --> 31:53.010
And I get so built up, and I--
that's the nightclub, girl.
You came in this competition

31:53.012 --> 31:57.114
to go to the next level.
What we're telling you is what
it takes, and I'm not gonna

31:57.116 --> 32:03.086
fucking steer you wrong, not
for no goddamn TV show.
You're here because I saw

32:03.088 --> 32:09.493
something in you, but you have
got to learn how to
own your stardom.

32:09.495 --> 32:16.333
All right, so let's move on.
Trinity K. Bonet.
Girl, you did us proud

32:16.335 --> 32:22.739
tonight.
[Applause]
So, Trinity, I'ma try to say

32:22.741 --> 32:28.445
this without getting emotional.
I'm so proud of you.
Based on what you've done in

32:28.447 --> 32:33.250
this competition before, there
seems to be a certain defeated
energy that I've seen,

32:33.252 --> 32:37.721
and I do the same thing myself,
and I have to...
[Sighs deeply]

32:37.723 --> 32:43.160
I have to talk myself off
that ledge.
What you've done is you have

32:43.162 --> 32:48.498
overcome your saboteur,
and I'm so proud to see it.
I'm so proud to see it.

32:48.500 --> 32:54.705
[Applause]
Thank you for believing
in me, because I know

32:54.707 --> 32:58.608
you saw something in me,
and I appreciate it.
Thank you.

32:58.610 --> 33:04.481
Let's move on.
Joslyn Fox.
Knowing that Bianca Del Rio

33:04.483 --> 33:09.186
is a comic, why would you put
yourself before her?
I thought she'd be

33:09.188 --> 33:13.090
a great way to close the show.
She is a great closer, but
what it does is it puts the

33:13.092 --> 33:18.595
person before her in
a really precarious situation
if you're not as strong.

33:18.597 --> 33:22.566
The funniest thing was
the a.D.D. Thing.
That's a character.

33:22.568 --> 33:26.470
The rest of the routine
could be that girl.
You started out strong,

33:26.472 --> 33:31.141
but then you just flatlined.
You're like a comedy terrorist.
You can fly the plane,

33:31.143 --> 33:37.514
but you can't land it.
All right, Bianca Del Rio.
I think you're amazing.

33:37.516 --> 33:41.685
You're so quick, but you know
exactly how to land a joke
and when to wait.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.555
You killed it.
Thanks.
So, so, so, so, so funny.

33:45.557 --> 33:48.959
I thought it was absolutely
astonishing.
I mean, you're the real deal.

33:48.961 --> 33:53.830
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck in the

33:53.832 --> 34:01.071
form decor lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.
Just between us girls,

34:01.073 --> 34:05.575
what do you think?
Let's start with Darienne Lake.
She was comfortable

34:05.577 --> 34:07.744
in her own skin.
She knows who she is.
She has heart.

34:07.746 --> 34:10.914
She played to the audience.
I thought she was great.
I loved her.

34:10.916 --> 34:14.217
Courtney Act.
I thought her routine
was average.

34:14.219 --> 34:18.288
I think she was smart to play
to her strength, which is
her voice and singing.

34:18.290 --> 34:23.026
But it's not exactly
what you asked for.
Next up, Adore Delano.

34:23.028 --> 34:26.663
She's such an interesting
presence on stage.
If she really got rid of

34:26.665 --> 34:31.501
all that doubt,
she would be unstoppable.
Think of yourself at that

34:31.503 --> 34:33.770
age, you know.
[Laughing] Oh.
Try to pull you out of

34:33.772 --> 34:37.007
the backseat of cars
to tell you--
[Laughter]

34:37.009 --> 34:41.311
Just slap the dick
out of your hand and say,
"Michelle, listen."

34:41.313 --> 34:45.248
All right, let's move on
to Ben de LA creme.
Her comedy was intelligent.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.351
She just doesn't understand
comic timing.
The smartest thing she did

34:48.353 --> 34:53.790
was, when the heckler happened,
she got off.
Laganja Estranja.

34:53.792 --> 34:57.994
I just don't quite get
that whole character who smokes
dope all the time,

34:57.996 --> 35:01.631
and yet can speak faster
than the bullet train.
When you get into a business

35:01.633 --> 35:04.968
like this, you have to build
thick skin.
You need to be able to handle

35:04.970 --> 35:07.337
the criticism.
Nobody's saying you're not
trying, girl.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.806
I'm saying it needs
to be better.
Yeah.

35:09.808 --> 35:15.846
Trinity K. Bonet.
I loved that she laughed at
herself and her life and allowed

35:15.848 --> 35:21.451
us to do that with her.
She followed Laganja,
and she made them stand up.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.054
She changed the energy
in the room.
Yeah.

35:24.056 --> 35:31.027
Joslyn Fox.
She started out very strong,
and then it just got less funny.

35:31.029 --> 35:33.530
"Oh, wow, a rhinestone."
Done.
[Laughs]

35:33.532 --> 35:38.368
It's a wrap.
And then there was Bianca.
The smart thing about her is,

35:38.370 --> 35:41.938
she makes fun of herself.
Now she can make fun of you.
Yes.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.708
I wanted her to come after
me, and I was sitting here,
like, "do me.

35:44.710 --> 35:48.178
Do me."
When you want somebody to rip
on you, that's a talent.

35:48.180 --> 35:55.485
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my funny girls.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.554
[Laughs]

35:57.556 --> 36:08.098
[Laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

36:08.100 --> 36:18.909
Darienne Lake,
you're safe.
Holy Trinity K. Bonet,

36:18.911 --> 36:20.977
you are safe.

36:20.979 --> 36:33.590
Bianca Del Rio,
tonight you didn't just kill it.
You were a mass murderer.

36:33.592 --> 36:40.730
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge,
and you've won a one-of-a-kind

36:40.732 --> 36:47.103
custom gown by Marco Marco.
Fabulous.
You may join the other girls.

36:47.105 --> 36:57.514
Courtney,
you're safe.
Thank you.

36:57.516 --> 37:05.222
Laganja Estranja,
you aimed high, but your routine
was a buzzkill.

37:05.224 --> 37:12.862
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Adore Delano,

37:12.864 --> 37:21.104
you're safe.
Thank you.
Ben de LA creme, you are

37:21.106 --> 37:30.614
a smart cookie, but tonight
your comedy routine crumbled.
Joslyn Fox, you are a lovable

37:30.616 --> 37:35.785
queen, but--
and it's quite an impressive
butt--

37:35.787 --> 37:39.089
your punch lines flatlined.

37:39.091 --> 37:47.330
Ben de LA creme,
you're safe.
Thank you.

37:47.332 --> 37:54.571
Thank you all.
Joslyn, my dear, I am sorry,
but you are up for elimination.

37:54.573 --> 38:04.547
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself

38:04.549 --> 38:11.855
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch

38:11.857 --> 38:21.831
[echoing] For your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.867
Stupid girls

38:23.869 --> 38:26.303
stupid girls

38:26.305 --> 38:28.772
maybe if I act like that

38:28.774 --> 38:34.477
flipping my blonde hair back
push out my bra like that
I don't want to be

38:34.479 --> 38:39.049
a stupid girl

Thank you, Ru, for this
incredible experience.
I know that in my heart of

40:08.173 --> 40:15.011
hearts, I stayed true to who I
was, and I will be the first
queen to actually chasse away.

40:23.955 --> 40:28.558
I came here to win, and it
didn't work out in my favor,
but this was definitely

a journey for me.
It's been filled with many ups
and many downs.

40:32.164 --> 40:37.033
I'm happy I made it this far,
and I can't wait to see what
the future holds.

Now, remember, if you can't love

40:47.045 --> 40:51.281
yourself, how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?

40:51.283 --> 40:54.284
All: Amen.
