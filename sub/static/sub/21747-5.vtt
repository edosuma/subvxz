00:01.280 --> 00:03.590
- Oh, my God.
- It was Jamie's idea.

00:03.640 --> 00:05.430
Why has he put it online?

00:05.480 --> 00:08.390
Oh, my God. George beats you.
Nikki, you have to leave him.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.310
- Have you decided I'm your charitable cause?
- I care about you.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.030
- Don't attack me. I'm not the
one with the problem. - I am.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.670
I have to live with you.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.390
We re-structure the company,
reduce your share to a third

00:18.440 --> 00:20.270
and I become an equal partner.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.990
Might I move in with you for a bit?

00:22.040 --> 00:24.990
It's a bit awkward at Adam and
Tina's since the whole porn thing.

00:25.040 --> 00:25.770
Oi!

00:26.700 --> 00:27.870
We're collateral damage.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.630
You didn't tell me you saw him
before we moved in together.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.270
- I didn't tell him.
- No, Sarah did.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.910
Adam, how do you know Jamie's wife?

00:33.960 --> 00:35.640
- Come on.
- I'll come when I'm ready.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.320
You're being an arsehole.

You can be sometimes, you know?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.480
- You sent me packing.
- I came home, didn't I?

01:02.800 --> 01:06.230
- You should've trusted me to see Jamie.
- I do. It's him I don't trust.

01:06.280 --> 01:10.000
- Can't you see he's trying to come between us?
- Can't you see he is?

He used to convene a family
meeting to discuss pocket money.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.590
Well, it taught the

Student bar.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.910
Studying-wise.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.550
You know, there's geography.

- You like geography.
- I hate geography. - Oh.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.830
- English? - There's no jobs at the end
of that. - There's a music faculty.

03:39.880 --> 03:43.550
You stand more chance of getting an
actual job with an English degree.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.910
- Obviously.
- You wanted the lad to come.

03:45.960 --> 03:46.550
Yeah?

03:47.800 --> 03:50.720
OK. Music faculty it is.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.150
- Karen?
- Mm?

like this, what do you think?

04:05.040 --> 04:07.030

04:07.080 --> 04:09.070
"How long's he gonna stay this time?"

04:09.120 --> 04:11.350
No, I'm going to a client's barbecue.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.030
New money, lots of it.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.070
I just didn't know what image to project.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.920
Is the theme Gilbert and Sullivan?

04:18.519 --> 04:20.519
Oh.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.430
- David.
- Nikki.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.760
- (How are you?)
- I'm, er... I'm fine.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.510
Oh. I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.440
I wasn't quite sure what the, er...

04:54.040 --> 04:56.910
- .. appropriate garb should be.
- Well, you got there in the end.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.990
It was a toss-up between
this and my T-shirt

04:59.040 --> 05:01.340
- from when The Smiths
played the Hacienda. - Oh.

05:01.860 --> 05:02.990
You were at that gig?

05:03.040 --> 05:04.630
Yeah, the famous one in '83.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.670
Well, don't look so surprised.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.200
- You know, I wasn't born middle-aged.
- No, but you suit it.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.470
- I was there too.
- No, you're not old enough.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.510
I was 17 with a fake ID, so who knows?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.590
I might've spilled beer on you.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.630
- Well, everyone else did.
- Oi! Oi!

05:21.680 --> 05:24.280
Nik, put David down and go
and get the lamp. Chop chop.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.990
"Chop chop". Do you get it?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.630
Chop chop, lamb, eh?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.110
Doesn't he know meat is murder?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.470
Come on! I'm waiting.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.760
(Oh, Heaven knows I'm miserable now.)

05:35.880 --> 05:37.590
David, come over here.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.470
There's someone I want you to meet.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.110
Meat! Ha!

05:41.160 --> 05:43.510
This reprobate here is Todd.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.150
Todd, this is David, my money man.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.190
- Pleased to meet you, David.
- How do you do?

05:47.240 --> 05:50.270
- Finally putting your house in
order, George? - Houses, plural.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.470
David is -- the whole portfolio.
He knows what he's doing.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.150
Oh, God.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.430
An A and two B's? Might be pushing it.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.750
Well, you'd be surprised what kids
can achieve when they're motivated.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.270
I hope so. I think he'd get
a lot out of going to uni.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.430
- Would that be based on your
experience, would it? - Shut up!

06:06.480 --> 06:08.480
- Taking the piss?
- I'm sorry?

06:09.680 --> 06:11.270
I didn't go to university.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.790
No, secretarial college, me.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.440
My husband went.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.160
Looks like he might be
tempted to re-enrol.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.400
We, er, take mature students.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.640
What makes you think he's mature?

06:27.640 --> 06:30.550
Seriously, can anyone apply?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.590
I mean, what about the
A and two B's thing?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.630
Different criteria for older applicants.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.750
It's more about whether
your cheque clears.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.800
Do you do business courses?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.910
Right, come on, Ringo (!)

06:47.960 --> 06:49.830
Give one of the other kids a chance.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.790
Well, come on! Thought we'd look
at the business faculty next.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.910
- Business?
- Yeah, yeah. It's only next door.

06:54.960 --> 06:59.440
Anyway, you might find it's
just what you're looking for.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.910
You didn't tell me you were
having to go away for the weekend.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.870
Well, we haven't exactly been speaking.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.510
Besides, I only found
out yesterday. Watch.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.870
Well, that doesn't give
you much time, does it?

07:13.920 --> 07:17.750
Well, to be fair, they did send out a company
e-mail, but I never read those things.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.150
I reckon, if there's
something important in them,

07:20.200 --> 07:23.000
then someone will tell me,
which they did, ultimately.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.030
You haven't said whether you're in or out.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.350
- We need to know for numbers.
- Yes. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.390
What are we talking about?

07:31.440 --> 07:33.470
- The team-building weekend.
- Ah, yes.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.800
- You're in?
- Team building? No.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.270
Hang on. Erm, a weekend you say?

07:42.320 --> 07:44.510
- Well, just the one night.
- It's not compulsory.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.000
Some people don't want to spend the
time away from their loved ones.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.670
OK. I'm in.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.510
You know, it's optional,

07:56.560 --> 07:59.760
but it's not a good look if the old
man doesn't show willing, you know?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.400
Jamie's wife going?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.320
Sarah? I don't know.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.070
Why, would that be a problem?

08:08.120 --> 08:11.070
It's just, I don't understand
why you didn't tell me about it.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.710
I suppose, er...

08:13.760 --> 08:16.710
I thought you might not like
it, you know, us being friends.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.750
- I'm not sure I do.
- Well, there you are, then.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.070
I like it even less that
you didn't tell me about it.

08:21.120 --> 08:24.400
Well, not much I can do about that now.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.110
So, is she going?

08:29.160 --> 08:31.150
What do you want me to do, Tina?

08:31.200 --> 08:33.710
Phone her and find out if
she is? Cancel then, huh?

08:33.760 --> 08:37.150
- You've got her phone number?
- I was being flippant. It's one night only.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.200
Frankly, the break might do us good.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.830
I didn't know you were coming.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.750
Didn't know you were.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.430
So, how are things?

08:54.480 --> 08:56.430
At home?

08:56.480 --> 09:00.350
Well, put it this way, I'm
not that sorry I'm here.

Would you like me to get you a tutor?

- No. I'd hate that.
- You've got exams coming up.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.030

- Maybe I'm just thick.

- Well, or don't care how well I do.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.830
- You've got to do your best.
- Isn't it more important that she's happy?

09:41.880 --> 09:44.950
- She won't be happy, will she, if
she can't get a job? - I'll be fine.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.990
If I'm not, I'll find
some man to live off.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.710
- Oh, my God! Give me strength.
- She's joking, Mum.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.830
God, you are so uptight.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.510
I just want you to make the
most of yourselves, that's all.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.510
- You could let us live our own lives.
- Then she'd have nothing to do.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.990
- I don't interfere.
- You are always telling us what to do.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.830
- "Eat your breakfast!" - "Don't
wear that!" - "Get an abortion!"

10:04.880 --> 10:06.470
What? Olivia!

10:06.520 --> 10:08.710
That was your choice.
That's what you decided.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.870
- That's what you wanted.
- You pushed me into it.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.990
- No, I didn't. I would've supported
you either way. - As if (!).

10:14.040 --> 10:16.910
You'd have been happy, her
going to school all pregnant?

10:16.960 --> 10:19.430
- Well, not happy, no, but --
- Dress it up how you like.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.280
You just want to control us!

10:22.400 --> 10:25.000
I just wondered if you
wanted a tutor, that was all.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.550
They don't mean it. They're
teenagers. Mean and ungrateful.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.390
Well, they don't take it out on David.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.040
Just save it all up for me.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.120
Change!

10:42.280 --> 10:43.870
Same with Pete.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.510
Kids bloody love him.

Yeah, well, it's hard not to, isn't it?

10:47.640 --> 10:49.640
I can manage.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.790
We're not seeing eye-to-eye at the minute.

10:52.840 --> 10:56.230
What you mean is he's not seeing
things the way you want him to.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.830
I do my best, it's the
ingratitude that really gets me.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.870
Ungrateful. Ungrateful.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.120
Ungrateful. Ungrateful. Ungrateful!

11:08.320 --> 11:10.110
I think I might have sprained my wrist.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.310
- You weren't punching that hard.
- No, but you were.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.470
- Oh, sorry.
- Ooh! Ow!

11:15.520 --> 11:18.270
Hey! Did Tina mention us going out?

11:18.320 --> 11:20.390
Yeah. I think I'll give that a miss, Jen.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.550
Oh, go on. We thought
we'd let our hair down.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.190
That's why I'm gonna give it a miss.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.990
I've got loads of work to do, anyway.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.760
Right, this is me.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.950
- To reveal the joker...
- Pete, thanks for the tip-off.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.110
- Am I too late?
- She's still with her mum.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.160
Oh, no, no, no. Hang on.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.150
David. This is a coincidence.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.470
Hey. A little bird told me you were here.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.840
Ah, you mean a stool pigeon?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.680
Have you got time for
a very weak cup of tea?

11:51.280 --> 11:53.070
Do you think we look out of place here?

11:53.120 --> 11:54.420
I bloody well hope so.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.550
- I enjoyed your do.
- Mm. Me too.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.710
Usually I'm stuck with the
wives who never crack a smile.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.550
Well, with all that... you
know, they probably can't.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.030
George thinks I should
zhuzh myself up a bit.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.110
Eh, there's beauty in a face of character.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.550
Oh, is that a polite way
of saying I'm looking old?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.190
No.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.910
Really!

12:16.960 --> 12:20.200
Shall we just stay here
and grow old together?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.310
Nikki, you have to leave George.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.680
If nothing else, it's only a matter
of time before he hits you again.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.510
I can recommend a good divorce lawyer.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.350
It's my ex-wife.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.390
I speak from painful experience.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.030
You know I've got no money of my own

12:40.080 --> 12:42.310
and it'll take months to
hammer out a settlement,

12:42.360 --> 12:44.150
so what will I live on in the meantime?

12:44.200 --> 12:46.390
I know George's finances
better than he does.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.070
I might be able to help.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.840
Just give me the word.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.150
My knight in shining Armani.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.910
Hugo Boss, actually.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.670
Is this your lady friend?

12:56.720 --> 12:58.510
The one you were telling me about?

12:58.560 --> 13:00.910
- My name's Vera.
- Nikki.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.310
You could do a lot worse
than this one, you know?

13:03.360 --> 13:05.350
He's a wonderful dancer.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.390
Which, in my experience, means
they're good in other departments too.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.040
Oh?

13:12.760 --> 13:14.830
Completely batty. Never seen her before.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.880
Goodbye, David.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.110
- Your card and your room key, sir.
- Thank you.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.790
What room are you in?

13:22.840 --> 13:24.630
That's very forward of you.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.790
Oh, God, no. It wasn't meant to be. 122.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.510
- I'm next door to you.
- I wonder who did the room allocation.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.630
I wonder whether there's
a connecting door.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.960
- That's very forward of you.
- Wasn't meant to be.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.290
- Whoa!
- Trust your partners!

13:41.340 --> 13:42.970
- Just let go.
- See? Easy.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.730
- Come on.
- That wasn't easy.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.770
Brilliant. OK, really good work here.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.810
Just keep going forward.

13:49.860 --> 13:52.010
Fantastic.

13:52.060 --> 13:55.170
- No, I've got to, er, go to something.
- Come on, come on.

13:55.220 --> 13:57.650
- Taxi.
- OK, work together.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.330
Tie in a knot.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.370
Come on. Yeah, you can do it.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.010
Good work.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.660
Brilliant.

14:13.260 --> 14:15.010
- David Marsden.
- It's Nikki.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.770
Can you hear me? I'm in a phone box.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.410
Nikki, are you all right?

14:18.460 --> 14:20.130
- George hasn't...?
- No, no.

14:20.180 --> 14:23.530
- I'm fine. I just didn't want this
to show up on my bill. - Right.

14:23.580 --> 14:26.690
I would've called sooner, but it's
taken forever to find a call box.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.040
Uh-huh. I'm glad they
still have a handful left.

14:30.460 --> 14:33.850
I was just wondering if your
offer to help me still stands?

14:33.900 --> 14:36.290
Yes. Of course it does. I'd be delighted.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.250
She's not here, Karen.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.810
- Er, she's gone out with Tina.
- Oh, I forgot that. Sorry, Pete.

14:41.860 --> 14:44.490
- I was just phoning for a chat, really.
- Well, I can do that.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.380
Probably not as well as Jen, but...

14:48.820 --> 14:50.410
.. I'll give it a go.

14:51.460 --> 14:52.050
So...

14:52.500 --> 14:55.250
- How are you? - Well, I've
been better to be honest, Pete.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.570
How about yourself?

14:57.620 --> 14:59.690
I've been worse.

15:01.420 --> 15:03.650
- Is that a beer?
- Ooh, you've got good hearing.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.290
Yeah, I just fancy one.

15:05.340 --> 15:06.930
Oh.

15:06.980 --> 15:08.570
I'm sorry.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.610
Please, don't be.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.660
- It's not your fault.
- I'll tell you what, I'll have a cup of tea.

15:14.820 --> 15:17.220
Yeah, I will as well. I'm
gonna have a builder's.

15:18.420 --> 15:20.010
Rosehip.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.450
So, why'd you say you've
been better, then?

15:22.500 --> 15:24.100
Is work getting you down?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.490
I tell you, Jen, I'm
glad to be getting out.

15:29.540 --> 15:31.570
I didn't fancy sitting
in front of the telly.

15:31.620 --> 15:34.810
- What's Matt doing? - He asked can
he have a couple of friends over.

15:35.860 --> 15:37.250
Heyyyyy!

15:37.300 --> 15:40.730
- Well, come in. - Hey. - Nice.

15:40.780 --> 15:42.570
Your Adam might be one of them.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.370
Nah. He's going to some party or other.

15:45.420 --> 15:48.330
- Yeah.
- All right?

15:48.380 --> 15:50.930
- You managed to get here.
- Yeah, yeah. - Nice, nice, nice.

15:50.980 --> 15:53.340
Just through there. Through here.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.330
Come on! Whoa!

15:59.380 --> 16:01.370
Whoa!

16:04.940 --> 16:07.770
- Go, go, go.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.250
Don't tell me, you grew up playing this.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.490
When this lot's parents
were in their nappies.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.330
OK, the top three go
through, led by Dadam.

16:19.820 --> 16:20.330
Dadam?

16:21.800 --> 16:22.330
Didn't you know?

16:22.380 --> 16:25.610
- That's your nickname.
- Dadam! Dadam! - Dadam?

16:26.260 --> 16:27.850
They like you enough to give you one.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.690
Contestants for the next heat.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.690
Right, I'm up. Any tips?

16:31.740 --> 16:34.090
Yeah. Drink and drive.

16:35.780 --> 16:38.690
A couple of weeks ago, we were
talking about starting a family.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.490
Now we're hardly talking at all.

16:40.540 --> 16:42.540
Oh! Me and Pete have had words too.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.810
He thinks I've been trying to get
Adam round to my way of thinking.

16:47.860 --> 16:50.090
- Our-Our Adam. - Oh, right. - Our Adam.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.890
Yeah, anyway, he's right and it's working.

16:52.940 --> 16:56.850
Last night, I caught Adam
looking at uni courses.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.170
Boom!

16:58.220 --> 17:00.250
Oh, Adam barely looked at me this morning.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.930
He just packed his bag and
buggered off for the weekend.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.650
Oh, God, if I thought there was
a chance of Pete doing that,

17:05.700 --> 17:07.290
I'd pack his bag for him.

17:07.339 --> 17:10.250
Oh, Jen, I just want to get
back to when we had fun.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.210
Mm, when you've been
together as long as we have,

17:13.260 --> 17:16.329
fun's not really an option.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.010
Oh, sod this.

17:18.060 --> 17:21.490
- I'm getting another drink. Hey, excuse me.
- I'm gonna get two.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.609
I haven't been this chuffed about winning

17:23.660 --> 17:26.530
since I got my Blue Peter badge
for sending in milk bottle tops.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.580
To more innocent times.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.460
Mm.

17:34.500 --> 17:38.020
I'm sorry for all the grief
that Jamie's caused you.

17:39.740 --> 17:41.420
We'll get beyond it.

17:44.140 --> 17:46.260
You don't want to hear about my problems.

17:49.340 --> 17:51.340
If you want to tell me...

18:05.940 --> 18:07.810
From the men at the bar.

18:07.860 --> 18:11.690
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh! Nice to know we've still got it.

18:11.740 --> 18:13.730
Mm.

18:13.780 --> 18:17.130
- Come on. - What? You're not going
over there to talk to them, are you?

18:17.680 --> 18:20.730
No. No, time to go somewhere else.

18:20.780 --> 18:22.780
♪ Let us Groove

18:32.140 --> 18:33.930
Hello?

18:33.980 --> 18:36.530
Er, yeah, can you come and pick us up?

18:36.580 --> 18:38.170
What, now?

18:38.220 --> 18:39.810
Can't you get an Uber?

18:39.860 --> 18:42.170
I don't think any would take us.

18:47.180 --> 18:49.250
I can't take it. I'm turning in.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.780
Yeah. Grown-ups' bedtime, eh?

18:58.940 --> 19:00.940
Ellie?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.890
- Adam?
- Shit.

19:12.940 --> 19:15.540
- Have you seen Ellie and
Olivia anywhere? - Er, upstairs.

19:17.220 --> 19:19.380
Oh, Liv, keep your hair out the sick.

19:22.340 --> 19:24.340
Ellie? Olivia?

19:54.420 --> 19:56.420
Would you like a night cap?

19:59.340 --> 20:01.740
Yeah. One can't do any harm.

20:07.660 --> 20:09.650
You should be looking out for each other.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.690
She needed to let her hair down.

20:11.740 --> 20:14.650
All she's had is people giving
her grief. You, most of all.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.500
For God's sake, Mum.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.100
Excuse me, guys.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.890
Oi! What you think you're doing?

20:22.940 --> 20:24.930
I can hear this half way down the street!

20:24.980 --> 20:27.370
Matt, who are all these people?

20:27.420 --> 20:29.210
A few more turned up.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.850
- Oh, hi, Jen. - Hi. - You
need to turn that music off!

20:31.900 --> 20:34.210
Liv, what's wrong?

20:34.260 --> 20:37.930
- Is she all right? - Yes, she's
fine, thank you very much, Matthew.

20:37.980 --> 20:39.650
Olivia...

20:39.700 --> 20:41.500
Call me in the morning, yeah?

20:44.140 --> 20:47.770
- Oh, all right, Mum. - Come
on. - I'm fine. - Kids, eh?

20:47.820 --> 20:50.530
Trouble is, they don't know
when they've had enough.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.580
- No, they don't, Jen.
- No.

20:53.980 --> 20:55.980
I can't get hold of Adam.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.490
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes, my lad.

21:07.340 --> 21:10.010
I feel like I wasted the last 12 months.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.380
Longer, if you include the time I
didn't know he was cheating on me.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.090
Three years, then.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.420
Which, at my age, I can't afford.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.490
You're early-on still, aren't you?

21:22.540 --> 21:26.370
You can't be older than,
what? 35? Four? Three?

21:26.420 --> 21:28.740
Should've gone to Specsavers.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.620
No, I've missed the boat.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.730
You'll meet someone.

21:34.780 --> 21:36.490
Where?

21:36.540 --> 21:39.370
Not work. Our colleagues are embryos.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.730
There's the internet.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.620
Where all the losers mingle?

21:46.900 --> 21:50.060
Anyway, after Jamie, I
don't have the confidence.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.780
No, why would you (?)

21:54.220 --> 21:55.810
I mean, you're not a looker (?)

21:55.860 --> 21:57.900
You're sort of plain-looking (!)

21:58.940 --> 22:00.620
Your personality is, erm...

22:01.860 --> 22:03.170
.. shite (!)

22:03.220 --> 22:06.140
And, er, apparently,
you're no spring chicken (!)

22:09.200 --> 22:11.250
Ha-ha! I was joking. I'm joking.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.930
It's the brandy, makes me maudlin.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.580
Maudlin.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.820
(Don't leave.)

23:07.800 --> 23:09.400
- Morning.
- Yes.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.000
(Shit, shit, shit.)

23:16.920 --> 23:18.920
(Shit.)

23:25.320 --> 23:27.120
Hiya.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.070
Ah!

23:31.120 --> 23:33.110
I'm so sorry, you know.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.670
Your phone was going
to voicemail all night.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.510
Ah, yeah, but no signal.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.550
You know, deepest Cheshire.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.790
- Oh, God. You'd think in this day
and age, wouldn't you? - Yeah, yeah.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.150
Still, um, you all right?

23:45.200 --> 23:47.550
I'm fine. A bit hungover, like.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.750
He just said it was
gonna be a few friends.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.400
Well, he was speaking teenager.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.120
Anyway...

23:56.640 --> 23:59.790
I feel guilty for leaving you
to deal with it all, you know?

23:59.840 --> 24:01.480
Thank you.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.190
So, how was it?

24:04.240 --> 24:06.430
- Your bondage session?
- What?

24:06.480 --> 24:08.470
Oh, er, bonding? Yeah.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.870
Er, the kids call me "Dadam".

24:10.920 --> 24:13.030
- Hm.
- It's a pet name, apparently.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.750
Hm. So, you made a few friends?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.390
Yeah.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.710
And, I got to, er, know people better.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.160
Mm. Does that include Sarah?

24:25.080 --> 24:26.790
Yeah.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.840
Let's not talk about her.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.310
Let's not talk about any of it, eh?

24:32.360 --> 24:34.360
I'd really like that.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.550
Well, I think it could be very successful.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.590
The story of a female elephant
who becomes leader of the herd.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.710
After poachers kill all the males.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.630
It's a story of female empowerment

24:46.680 --> 24:49.590
with a strong conservationist
message, beautifully written.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.320
It's perfect for teenage girls.

24:53.720 --> 24:54.510
I'm so sorry.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.760
Could you just, er, excuse
me a minute, please?

25:04.520 --> 25:07.630
- How are you feeling? - I just had
a bit too much to drink, that's all.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.270
- Is it because of Matt?
- No.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.000
Why would it be?

25:13.240 --> 25:15.950
I just know you've been under
a lot of pressure recently.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.190
But getting pissed won't solve anything.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.350
I do not need another
lecture from you, OK.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.790
OK.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.560
God!

25:26.640 --> 25:28.320
OK.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.070
Where were we?

25:35.120 --> 25:37.310
- Discussing Leader Of The Herd.
- Oh, yes.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.710
Well, I can't support buying this book.

25:39.760 --> 25:43.390
I'm sorry to hear that, Benjamin, but
I can't say I'm altogether surprised.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.150
Still, two votes to one.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.790
- I agree with Ben.
- What?

25:46.840 --> 25:49.390
- Sorry, I just don't get it.
- Why are you calling him Ben?

25:49.440 --> 25:53.070
- We can't see its appeal.
- Of course you can't, you're middle-aged men.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.870
- There's no need to be sexist.
- What, me?

25:54.920 --> 25:57.270
- Or hysterical.
- Ben, no, look, no. I'll handle this.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.950
Can you stop calling him Ben?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.350
Karen, we understand that
you want to publish books

26:01.400 --> 26:03.670
which have strong and
positive roles for women,

26:03.720 --> 26:05.950
- but this book just hates men.
- No, it doesn't.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.710
Well, they all wind up dead.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.630
- And the herd's better off without them.
- Well, I'm sorry, but --

26:10.680 --> 26:13.990
There's an enormous market at the
moment for psychological thrillers.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.790
You know, Gone Girl, Girl On
The Train, that sort of thing.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.030
- Would you like to publish something like that?
- All the women are mad.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.590
- Those books are very popular.
- Especially among women.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.070
Look, this is an important book.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.790
- About female elephants.
- Yeah, and I am asking you to support me.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.030
No, my responsibility
is to the shareholders.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.950
David, that is the three of us.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.100
And that involves sometimes making
decisions that are not universally popular.

26:39.780 --> 26:40.780
Hiya.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.670
- Hello, love.
- Hi.

26:45.720 --> 26:48.760
Have you done that application?
It needs to be in soon.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.280
Not if I'm not going, it doesn't.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.160
- I'll let Dad explain.
- Sit.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.870
He's decided uni's not for him.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
I didn't realise how expensive it is.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.390
This is your doing. You've
talked him out of it, haven't you?

27:08.440 --> 27:10.310
No, you talked him into it.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.150
I've just offered another opinion.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.840
I want to be a muso,
Mum. That's my ambition.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.310
Your Dad and me need to have a quiet word.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.560
Go somewhere that you
can't hear me shouting.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.920
This is about you.

27:32.080 --> 27:36.470
You wanted to be Keith Moon
playing Madison Square Garden.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.910
Instead, you only got as far
as your Dad's garden shed.

27:39.960 --> 27:43.230
- It's John Bonham. - What?
- Led Zeppelin. - Whatever.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.670
You're using our son
to fulfil your dreams.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.310
- It's pathetic.
- Yeah, they're his dreams too.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.640
Not like uni, where you wish you'd gone.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.040
Damn right, I do.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.310
And I'm not gonna stand by

28:01.360 --> 28:04.520
and see Adam fail to
fulfil his potential...

28:05.560 --> 28:07.560
.. like I have.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.400
Hi.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.110
OK.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.230
Maybe you didn't see
what you thought you saw.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.350
Maybe she was upset and
he was comforting her.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.430
- He had his tongue halfway down her throat.
- Doesn't sound like Matt.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.070
Well, he is your son.

28:34.120 --> 28:37.220
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Come on. You've always been a flirt.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.070
Any woman who's remotely attractive,

28:40.120 --> 28:42.190
you've gotta feel like you stand a chance.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.990
- Is that how you see me?
- Yes. Vanity, pure and simple.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.630
All perfectly harmless,
until you take it too far.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.110
It just got out of hand.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.870
It wasn't planned.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.560
Did Matt tell you about it?

28:54.920 --> 28:57.310
Oh, I imagine that's what happened.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.350
Adam, two weeks ago,

28:59.400 --> 29:01.190
Olivia was pregnant with Matt's child.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.830
He needs to recognise that,

29:02.880 --> 29:06.350
not go around like some sweaty
teenager governed by his hormones.

29:06.400 --> 29:09.230
- In his defence, he --
- No. Olivia deserves better.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.830
And I, for one cannot handle her
grief if she finds out, so please,

29:12.880 --> 29:16.230
you need to sit Matt down and give
him a talk about responsibility.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.480
- OK, OK. - OK. - Karen. Karen...

29:28.240 --> 29:30.240
- See you, Dad.
- Oi!

29:33.240 --> 29:35.240
Sit.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.990
- I'm sorry that the party got out of hand.
- Not worried about that.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.720
- Can I have another?
- No.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.080
How are things between you and Olivia?

29:50.960 --> 29:52.560
Fine.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.190
Yeah. Good.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.840
Wait.

30:00.560 --> 30:03.190
- So, you weren't snogging
another girl? - Oh.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.670
Matt and I are just, erm,
having a father-son chat.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.920
Oh. Is everything all right?

30:14.840 --> 30:16.830
I kissed another girl at my party.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.270
Oh, Matt, you cheated on Olivia?

30:19.320 --> 30:20.910
No.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.150
It was just a kiss.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.790
Matt, that's cheating.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.840
But, it's just...

30:30.240 --> 30:32.350
She's just so down at the moment.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.190
She's got good reason.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.910
I know.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.360
But it's like we don't
have any fun anymore.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.640
It's like we've forgotten how to.

30:43.800 --> 30:48.470
Son, all relationships
go through ups and downs.

30:48.520 --> 30:50.310
Yeah, at the first sign of trouble,

30:50.360 --> 30:52.950
you don't go running off into
the arms of somebody else.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.200
- That would be...
- Cowardly.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.150
Selfish.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.800
Yeah.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.280
Don't be that person, son.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.160
Thanks.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.950
So, if you sign on page five...

31:19.000 --> 31:21.830
Doesn't putting the assets in Nikki's name

31:21.880 --> 31:23.550
give her control over them?

31:23.600 --> 31:25.390
Well, technically, yes.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.630
Yeah, well, I like to be on top of
our affairs. Keeps things simple.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.200
Well, as a twice-divorced
man, I empathise.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.510
And anticipating your apprehension,

31:35.560 --> 31:38.230
I've taken the precaution of drawing up

31:38.280 --> 31:41.320
this Power of Attorney,
which you also sign, Nikki.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.790
- What does this mean for me?
- Nothing, love.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.230
The tax man thinks the
assets are in your name,

31:47.280 --> 31:48.950
but you don't really control them.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.440
- Is that right?
- Well, put simply, yes.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.760
Oh, looks like it's that
time of the month again.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.750
Sarah?

32:09.800 --> 32:13.230
Listen, I've, er, I've been waiting
for a chance to get you on your own.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.750
- Oh, tiger.
- No, no.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.430
Er, not like that.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.150
Erm...

32:19.200 --> 32:22.790
Listen, what happened, it shouldn't have.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.640
It was... it was a terrible mistake.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.280
- Terrible? - No, not terrible
but-but it was a mistake.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.960
Can we just pretend it never occurred?

32:36.920 --> 32:38.640
Is that what you want to do?

32:41.240 --> 32:43.240
Yes, I'm sorry.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.480
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.950
- You can't. - I want to revisit
the terms of our agreement.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.710
- Not every time things don't go your way.
- This is my company!

33:13.760 --> 33:15.390
It's mine.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.750
Fuck.

33:17.800 --> 33:18.630
Fuck.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.760
- For God's sake.
- Mum?

33:30.440 --> 33:32.040
Mum?

33:33.920 --> 33:36.000
- Come on.
- Mum?

33:39.640 --> 33:41.630
Er, what time will dinner be?

33:41.680 --> 33:44.350
- What? - I'm meeting Matt later.
- No, you're not seeing him.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.150
Stop trying to control me like
one of your precious authors.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.590
Mum, I told you this
shouldn't go in the dryer.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.150
It cost me 50 quid in a sale, so
it's not like I can replace it.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.870
- Matt's the only one who cares for me.
- I have nothing to wear, thanks to you.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.710
Are you gonna buy it for me?

33:58.760 --> 34:01.160
- He's the only one who cares for me.
- For God's sake!

34:07.960 --> 34:10.750
- Your Dad's just popped to see
a man about a dog. - A dog?

34:10.800 --> 34:13.989
- Yeah, can I give him a message?
- Er, yes. Mum's gone AWOL.

34:14.040 --> 34:16.590
- What? Say that again?
- She just walked out the house,

34:16.639 --> 34:19.230
left the front door open, her
phone on the kitchen table

34:19.280 --> 34:22.150
- and a pan of water boiling on the hob.
- And how long ago was this?

34:22.199 --> 34:24.750
Did you tell them to turn
the pan of water off?

34:24.800 --> 34:26.429
Oh, Jen, it was two hours ago.

34:26.480 --> 34:29.320
The Fire Brigade would be there
if they hadn't. Oh, hang on.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.150
Have you spoken to Karen lately?

34:32.199 --> 34:34.510
Yes, she rang me earlier.
Sounded in a foul mood.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.550
Oh, why? What did she say?

34:36.600 --> 34:38.750
Judas!

34:38.800 --> 34:42.429
That was it. One word. I could
tell she wasn't happy. Same again?

34:42.480 --> 34:44.670
Er, yeah. Er...

34:44.719 --> 34:46.429
You need to call Ellie.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.270
Jen, I'm really worried about her.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.590
OK, well, let's just keep calm.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.350
She's probably just gone for a walk.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.429
I spoke to her a couple of nights
ago. She wasn't happy then either.

34:55.480 --> 34:58.580
I don't know, Pete. Sometimes, I
just find it all so overwhelming.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.280
I just wish I could walk away from it all.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.230
You'll manage to cope, Karen.

35:06.280 --> 35:08.000
You always do.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.470
Yeah, I do.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.110
I do.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.760
I do, Pete.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.870
Right. Well, let's think.
Where would she have gone?

35:19.920 --> 35:22.950
- Well, I don't know, do I?
- Oh, hang on, I might.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.470
I've always fancied staying here.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.270
- It's too expensive though, isn't it?
- We get a discount.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.210
I'll e-mail you the code.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.950
- Look, it's not far. I'm going.
- Take David with you.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.800
I think he's part of the problem.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.550
David, I don't think there's
anything to worry about,

35:39.600 --> 35:42.080
but I think you should
get home to the girls.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.480
I think I should get home to the girls.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.030
I think you've got a Karen
Marsden staying with you.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.110
Can you tell me what room number she's in?

37:01.160 --> 37:04.520
- We don't give out that information,
but I can call the room. - Please.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.720
- She could be out or in the shower.
- Or not answering.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.350
Please, can you tell me the room?

37:15.400 --> 37:16.990
Or-Or maybe what floor she's on?

37:17.640 --> 37:22.110
Look, the thing is, she's my
wife. She's already checked in.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.110
She's told me what room she's in,
but I've forgotten the number.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.990
We're playing a little game, you see.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.590
She leaves the door on the
latch, I walk in unannounced,

37:29.640 --> 37:32.190
she, well, she pretends that
she doesn't know who I am.

37:32.240 --> 37:35.270
It-It's more romantic
than it sounds, but...

37:35.320 --> 37:37.630
Please, can you...? I'm late already.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.080
- Perhaps if I give the
room another try? - Oh, yeah.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.110
Was that last digit a four?

37:46.160 --> 37:47.840
Thanks.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.310
Karen?

38:02.360 --> 38:04.070
Karen? Karen, it's Pete.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.920
Karen, please open the door.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.560
Karen.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.870
- Pete.
- Come here.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.510
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.030
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.480
- Hiya.
- In here.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.190
Oh, get you.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.520
When you said you'd do dinner,
I had visions of a ready meal.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.480
Matt has a late rehearsal.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.840
How late?

38:52.880 --> 38:57.200
Well, he said he'd be back after nine.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.720
Thank you.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.230
Will this keep?

39:09.280 --> 39:11.360
- Haven't done the vegetables yet. - Hm.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.560
And the candles won't burn down.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.640
And to be honest, I'm not much
of a cook, so it doesn't matter.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.390
What would happen if you drank it?

39:41.440 --> 39:44.190
I'd have emptied the mini-bar,

39:44.240 --> 39:47.120
broke into next door, started on theirs.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.240
Game over, Pete.

39:53.800 --> 39:54.790
Christ.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.830
When I was younger,

39:56.880 --> 40:01.150
- I thought, when I grow up, that I'd
have everything worked out. - Yeah.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.990
I grew up and I thought everyone
else had been given the manual

40:05.040 --> 40:07.480
on how to do life except me.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.360
Now, I realise, well...

40:11.840 --> 40:14.240
- .. we just make it
up as we go along. - Mm.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.990
Some people are better at
hiding it than others, though.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.910
Well, you don't do too badly.

40:21.960 --> 40:25.600
Respected business
woman, perfect mother...

40:27.160 --> 40:28.790
.. bit of a babe.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.030
Well, I can't vouch for
the parenting skills,

40:33.080 --> 40:35.360
but, um, the rest, well, yeah.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.750
Do you ever worry that you might relapse?

40:41.800 --> 40:43.480
Into depression?

40:47.640 --> 40:50.240
God, it's always at the back of my mind.

40:53.240 --> 40:56.360
And I wonder, you know, if
Jen were ever to leave me...

40:57.840 --> 40:59.630
.. that would be enough to tip me back.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.430
Yeah, but she never would though.
She'd be lost without you.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.550
Oh, you should hear
what she says sometimes.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.830
Yeah, but she doesn't mean it. She just says
whatever comes into her head, doesn't she?

41:08.880 --> 41:10.680
I'll look out for you.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.200
I mean, you've got enough
responsibility as it is.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.550
You know what?

41:18.600 --> 41:20.600
I'll do the same for you.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.960
You already did.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.230

There's a degree in music business.

Look. It covers rights,
distribution, touring, all of it.

42:31.440 --> 42:35.040
I could still be in the
band, but manage it as well.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.670

breakfast together.

we appreciate everything you do.

And, as for me, I wanted to apologise.

Pete spoke to you, didn't he?

43:32.840 --> 43:34.430
What did he say?

43:34.480 --> 43:37.240
Oh, very little, despite
my efforts to draw him out.

43:42.280 --> 43:44.150

44:09.520 --> 44:11.590
Er, got a takeaway.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.630
- What about you?
- Same.
