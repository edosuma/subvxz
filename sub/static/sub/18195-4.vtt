00:40.760 --> 00:41.795
Oooh...

00:41.880 --> 00:43.074
I can't wait...

00:43.160 --> 00:44.752
to get into bed.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.719
Oh! Isn't that lovely?
- Thank you!

01:48.880 --> 01:52.475
So, you'd like a loan of 4,000 pounds.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.710
May I ask what for?

01:57.280 --> 01:58.474
A baby.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.358
This doesn't involve
Romanian orphanages, does it?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.232
No. No!

02:05.320 --> 02:07.197
No, we're having treatment.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.840
We've already had one shot, as it were.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.353
And it didn't work out.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.476
And we'd like to give it another go.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.039
I see.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.829
Your account is not with this
bank, Mr Williams?

02:18.920 --> 02:19.955
No.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.950
So, why haven't you approached them first?

02:24.240 --> 02:25.593
With my debts?

02:30.720 --> 02:31.914
Joking.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.195
My account's been here for years.

02:34.280 --> 02:39.991
And besides, your advertising says you're
in the business of making dreams come true.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.755
Yes. It's funny how many people
take that at face value.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.230
And it's your dream to have a baby, is it?

02:47.320 --> 02:49.754
Isn't it every woman's dream?

02:55.280 --> 02:56.474
Excuse me.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.592
If we wanted to buy a Honda Civic, would
we have to justify ourselves like this still?

03:02.680 --> 03:05.797
I mean, it's not like we're doing
something illegal, like...

03:05.880 --> 03:08.792
financing a drug deal or hiring a hit man.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.678
Surely the most important thing is
that we're...

03:12.960 --> 03:14.712
..able to pay the money back?

03:16.560 --> 03:17.959
We can.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.752
So, are you going to lend us the money?

03:23.400 --> 03:26.517
So the petition's now up to 700 signatures.
- Great.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.798
Admittedly, they're not all real. Mickey
Mouse has signed on 15 separate occasions.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.316
As long as no-one from the council looks
too closely, it shouldn't matter.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.312
But actually, should we send it
to the council or the developers?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.709
David?
- Hmm?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.951
The petition. Shall we send it to
the council or to the developers?

03:44.040 --> 03:47.828
Well, I think we should try to get
to 1000 signatures first. Is that possible?

03:47.920 --> 03:51.708
Yeah, I'm sure we can get a few more. There
must be some Donald Ducks we've missed.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.233
Right.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.595
One, we present it to the council...

03:55.680 --> 03:56.908
Karen!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.035
Hi.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.951
Hello, Jessica. How are you?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.996
Fine, fine. Thank you.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.832
Goodness me. What on earth is that?

04:05.200 --> 04:08.590
Do you want to phone a friend
or ask the audience?

04:10.160 --> 04:12.230
Josh's school's on holiday.

04:12.320 --> 04:16.279
Someone had to look after the rabbit
and you volunteered, didn't you, darling?

04:16.360 --> 04:18.430
Won't be for long.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.351
Hare today, gone tomorrow.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.037
How are you getting on?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.715
Oh, we're making progress.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.556
Right, well, we'll leave you to it.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.791
Come on, darling,
let's go and get him some lettuce.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.279
Where were we?

04:49.800 --> 04:51.119
David?

04:52.440 --> 04:55.352
The developers want to set up a meeting.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.113
Well, I think we should send
our best people along.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.156
Well, that would be you and me, then.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.272
<i>...a windy day. Rain clearing to the west.
Sunny spells and showers...</i>

05:28.560 --> 05:30.073
Hello, Tiger!

05:31.720 --> 05:33.711
God! Ooh!

05:33.800 --> 05:35.950
Right. My God, I can smell you from here!

05:36.040 --> 05:38.315
Come on. It's time for your bath.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.630
Do you want a hand?
- Er...

05:40.720 --> 05:44.554
No, we'll be all right, won't we? You stay
and watch the telly. It's your favourite.

05:44.640 --> 05:48.110
That's Robert's favourite!
- Huh? The weather?

05:48.200 --> 05:53.194
What? McManaman's past it. He'd never get
into an English team. That's why he plays in Spain.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.159
Yeah, but for a team
that beat Manchester United! Ha!

05:57.240 --> 05:59.276
Hey, that's a bit of a high tackle.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.318
So er...what do you fancy doing tonight?

06:02.400 --> 06:06.029
Oh, do you want to take me out, hmm?
Show me a good time?

06:06.120 --> 06:07.758
Well, I'll take you out.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.912
Hang on a sec, love. - Sorry, I didn't
know you were on the phone.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.433
It's OK, it's only Ramona.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.509
Ha!

06:13.600 --> 06:16.910
I was wanting to ask you something,
only it's a bit delicate.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.911
If it's about the rent, I get
paid on Friday.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.513
Oh, no, no, it's not the rent, no.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.478
I was wondering
if you were doing anything tonight.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.949
Yeah, he's taking me out. Hello!

06:26.040 --> 06:28.793
My five-a-side team,
we've got a tournament tonight.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.190
Only, our goalie's let us down.
I was wondering if you fancied filling in?

06:32.280 --> 06:33.759
Why is that a delicate question?

06:33.840 --> 06:35.558
Well, um...

06:35.640 --> 06:37.392
All the teams are gay.

06:39.320 --> 06:43.711
Do you know, I'd love to,
but I promised I'd take Ramona out tonight.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.268
OK. No worries. It was just if you
were free.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.437
Sorry about that, love. So...

06:50.520 --> 06:52.670
What do you fancy doing?
- You'll let me choose?

06:52.760 --> 06:55.228
Your wish is my command.
- Good.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.198
Cos I want to watch you play gay football.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.069
I'm having lunch with Jenny tomorrow.
Gonna come?

07:02.160 --> 07:04.276
There's post for you on the side there.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.918
Oh, right.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.877
So, are you gonna come?

07:07.960 --> 07:09.837
Absolutely.
- Robert will be there.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.798
Oh, no, that's right. I'm painting my nails.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.599
You know, you could at least
try and get to know him.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.477
Why?

07:17.560 --> 07:19.278
For Jenny.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.952
If I bump into him, I'll be civil.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.918
But for Pete's sake,
we're never going to be friends.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.672
Very mature of you.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.239
Grazie.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.039
We got the money.
The bank's approved the loan.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.395
Woo-hoo!

07:33.800 --> 07:35.552
Whew!
- Excellent.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.595
Hmm.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.672
Are you sure you want to do this?
- It's a lot of money.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.398
I'm not talking about the money.

07:41.480 --> 07:45.155
Yeah, but it is a lot of money.
It's four grand, plus the interest.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.993
And there's still only
a one-in-five chance of it working.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.992
I'm not talking about the money.
- What if we fail again?

07:51.080 --> 07:53.719
How many times do we go through it?
Three times? Four times?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.473
Providing they'll give us that much.

07:56.560 --> 08:01.634
Then what are we? Childless and broke.
That's a great future to look forward to, isn't it?

08:01.720 --> 08:04.359
We'll stop now if that's what you'd rather,
go on holiday.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.873
No.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.513
No.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.796
I'm not ready to give up yet, are you?

08:15.280 --> 08:17.748
Mmm, St Lucia would have been nice.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.195
I'd rather go to Skegness with our kid.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.632
Cor! Skeggy!

08:22.720 --> 08:23.755
Mm-hm.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.755
Do you think we should name the baby
after the bank?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.751
Nat West Williams?
- Or Bradley.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.558
Or Bradley.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.631
That's a conversation we haven't had.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.870
And shall be having.

08:39.320 --> 08:43.154
These don't fit. They're too big. My fingers...
- You'll be fine. Just relax.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.754
Pete! Look! Someone's coming! The ball!

08:47.440 --> 08:49.590
Oh, you let them catch you! Come on!

08:49.680 --> 08:51.716
Ref, what's the matter? Open your eyes!

08:53.280 --> 08:55.555
Come on, Reds! Come on now, Reds!

08:57.760 --> 08:59.432
Look to your left! Look to your left!

09:01.640 --> 09:03.835
No! No!

09:07.760 --> 09:09.159
You are blind!

09:10.120 --> 09:11.439
Get up, you soft git!

09:11.520 --> 09:13.829
You're having a laugh! Come on!

09:13.920 --> 09:15.512
You blind! You crazy!

09:15.600 --> 09:16.999
Oh, no!

09:17.080 --> 09:19.799
<i>Baby, you were right.
That was not your fault.</i>

09:19.880 --> 09:21.438
What a stupid man!

09:21.520 --> 09:22.555
Oi!

09:38.840 --> 09:40.319
Yeah!

09:49.640 --> 09:51.756
You saved the day! My hero!

09:58.480 --> 10:01.119
<i>The photographs of Antarctica
are just astonishlng,</i>

10:01.200 --> 10:02.838
<i>some of my favourltes in the book.</i>

10:02.920 --> 10:06.595
<i>When you're taking a picture of somewhere
like that, what are you looking for?</i>

10:06.680 --> 10:07.954
<i>Penguins.</i>

10:08.040 --> 10:11.794
<i>Don't know, really. You need something
to give you a sense of scale,</i>

10:11.880 --> 10:16.908
<i>to convey the smallness of a human being
in relation to that landscape.</i>

10:17.000 --> 10:20.072
<i>It was in the Antarctic
that you developed frostbite.</i>

10:20.160 --> 10:23.470
<i>Yes, foolish, really.
It does creep up on you.</i>

10:23.560 --> 10:26.552
<i>I only took my gloves off for a
couple of seconds to change lenses.</i>

10:26.640 --> 10:30.519
<i>And your hands get cold
and they just never warm up.</i>

10:30.600 --> 10:33.512
<i>The pain is excruciating.</i>

10:33.600 --> 10:38.071
<i>I can't think of anything worse, frankly.
- You wanna try giving birth to twins, mate.</i>

10:38.160 --> 10:41.516
<i>Well, childbirth, maybe.
But I'll have to take your word for that.</i>

10:41.600 --> 10:44.558
<i>OK, well, we're going
to go to the phones now.</i>

10:44.640 --> 10:48.110
<i>My guest tonight is explorer
and photographer Miles Brodle.</i>

10:48.200 --> 10:50.270
<i>If you'd like to put a question to Miles...</i>

10:50.360 --> 10:52.749
<i>Brodie? - ..about his adventures
in the Antarctic</i>

10:52.840 --> 10:56.389
<i>or any other of the countless fascinating
places he's been, give us a call.</i>

10:57.520 --> 11:00.398
<i>08081 570980.</i>

11:00.480 --> 11:03.358
<i>That's 08081 570980.</i>

11:03.440 --> 11:06.398
<i>...570980!
- What is your favourite country?</i>

11:06.480 --> 11:11.315
OK, I'd like to thank Peter for stepping in
at such short notice and playing a blinder.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.118
Well done, Peter.
- Thanks a lot.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.191
Where is Ian, anyway?
- Injured.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.554
Broke a fingernail.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.438
Occupational hazard, goalkeeping.
Should wear gloves.

11:19.520 --> 11:22.080
He doesn't believe in protection!
- Look, listen up.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.958
This is serious, right? This is the final.

11:25.040 --> 11:29.113
Now, the Queen's Shilling are a good team,
especially their number nine. Watch out for him.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.873
Let's just try and stay with it, shall we?

11:31.960 --> 11:35.555
Cos if we can take this through to penalties,
Peter just might win it for us.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.313
Now, come on. All for one!
- And one for all!

11:38.400 --> 11:40.675
Yay!

11:43.880 --> 11:46.838
Hey. So, are you going to hang about
for another game?

11:46.920 --> 11:48.478
Yeah.
- Yeah?

11:48.560 --> 11:52.314
Yeah, but listen. You watch out for number five.
Because I've seen his last game.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.472
The minute a goalie comes anywhere near him,
he dive!

11:55.560 --> 11:56.675
Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.159
So, er...

11:58.240 --> 12:00.037
how about a kiss for good luck?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.473
Yeah.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.790
Um...how about a proper one?

12:06.400 --> 12:07.435
Hmm.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.116
All right, mate?

12:22.960 --> 12:25.554
Cheers.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.197
Captain.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.508
Goalie.

12:39.880 --> 12:44.510
It's been alleged that you're cheating.
- How can that be? We haven't kicked off yet.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.238
You are a ringer!

12:46.320 --> 12:47.514
What's that?

12:48.400 --> 12:50.152
You're not gay.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.038
This tournament's
for gay teams only.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.634
And I saw you kissing your girlfriend.

12:55.720 --> 12:59.429
She's not my girlfriend, right?
Er...that was just for luck.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.318
With tongues?
- Excuse me, you!

13:02.400 --> 13:06.473
He is bisexual, OK?
- No! No, I'm not! Give over!

13:06.560 --> 13:09.199
Yes! Yes, I am. Yes.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.511
But I'm just having trouble
coming to terms with it, that's all.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.310
Positive discrimination.

13:18.400 --> 13:22.109
<i>Karen, you'll hear the programme over the
phone. Speak when Barbara speaks to you.</i>

13:22.200 --> 13:24.998
<i>OK, you're on next.
- Karen from Manchester.</i>

13:25.080 --> 13:28.197
<i>Karen, what's your question for Miles?
- Hello, Miles.</i>

13:28.280 --> 13:29.554
<i>Hi.</i>

13:29.640 --> 13:35.317
My question is this - what is the effect
on a dog of inhaling helium?

13:35.400 --> 13:38.597
<i>I'm sorry?
- Inhaling helium.</i>

13:38.680 --> 13:41.035
What does it do to a dog?

13:43.840 --> 13:45.990
<i>Karen...Reece?</i>

13:46.080 --> 13:48.833
Well, it's Marsden now, actually.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.878
<i>Oh, my God! I don't believe it!</i>

13:51.960 --> 13:53.632
Hello, Brodie.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.073
<i>How are you?</i>

13:55.160 --> 13:57.116
I'm very well, thank you. How are you?

13:57.200 --> 14:00.158
Well, apart from the frostbite.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.196
So, are you going to er...

14:02.280 --> 14:04.077
come in for coffee?

14:06.400 --> 14:09.631
If you don't want David and Karen to see,
we can go straight to my room.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.798
I'm not sure, Ramona.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.189
What? You don't drink coffee
at this time of night?

14:16.280 --> 14:18.430
No, no, it's not that. It's just...

14:18.520 --> 14:20.670
Oh. Ah!

14:20.760 --> 14:22.796
So, you really mean it about the coffee?

14:22.880 --> 14:24.518
Well, we can...

14:24.600 --> 14:26.591
start with coffee.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.075
Hmm?

14:29.880 --> 14:31.552
Yeah, OK.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.478
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:38.560 --> 14:40.437
Missed a bit.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.750
Really? Oh...no!

14:42.840 --> 14:44.876
No, no! Come on!

14:44.960 --> 14:47.349
Soap?
- Ah! Right, that is enough!

14:47.440 --> 14:49.112
Argh! No!

14:49.200 --> 14:51.634
Naughty, naughty, naughty!
- No, not the cloth.

14:51.720 --> 14:55.508
Naughty, naughty head
with a dishcloth or a nice hat.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.036
How about I stay the night?

15:02.120 --> 15:03.838
Oh!

15:05.720 --> 15:08.314
Look, Jen, it's a simple concept,
really, OK?

15:08.400 --> 15:11.073
Me. Here. Overnight.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.719
I don't know.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.155
OK, let's try it again.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.674
Robert. Jenny's house.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.193
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.352
No, I get the concept.
It's just complicated, you know.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.796
It's not complicated, Jen. Adam knows
about us. He's not stupid, you know.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.839
Yeah, but there's a difference between being
Mummy's friend and his new dad.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.674
Hey, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I'm just saying
stay the night, not file for adoption.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.910
I just don't want him getting used to you

15:37.000 --> 15:39.719
and then we have a bloody great big row,

15:39.800 --> 15:41.995
you bugger off and he doesn't know
where he is.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.154
Look...

15:50.280 --> 15:52.635
..I'm not going anywhere, OK?

15:53.840 --> 15:55.159
So shut it.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.639
Let me stay.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.437
You're not going anywhere?

16:02.600 --> 16:03.589
Well...

16:04.560 --> 16:07.597
..just upstairs, if you'll let me.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.878
I might.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.598
I might not.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.033
I might.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.391
I might not.
- Mm-hm?

16:17.480 --> 16:19.755
Oh, bugger it.
- Come on.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.154
Jen.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.229
Mmm...

16:41.160 --> 16:42.149
Hey!

16:42.240 --> 16:45.994
Hey! Hello, Tiger!

16:46.080 --> 16:47.672
Um...

16:47.760 --> 16:50.149
Robert didn't go home last night.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.878
Did you? No.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.474
You've probably already worked that out.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.715
Breakfast, anyone?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.916
So there was this huge Alsatian, right?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.956
Yapping like a Chihuahua.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.630
God, it was funny!

17:07.720 --> 17:10.393
I guess you had to be there.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.868
He didn't sound like he'd changed at all,
you know.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.352
Let's hope he's grown up a little.

17:15.440 --> 17:20.036
They said they'd give me his number while
he's in London. Thought I might give him a ring.

17:20.119 --> 17:21.189
Mm-hm.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.515
Hey, by the way, I don't think
Hector's a boy.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.309
Hector?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.674
The rabbit.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.352
How can you tell?

17:32.440 --> 17:36.149
Because, my darling, he gave birth
during the night. Six times, actually.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.198
I don't think he's finished yet.
- Oh, terrific!

17:42.840 --> 17:44.319
<i>Er...no, Josh.</i>

17:44.400 --> 17:48.154
Not that, thank you very much, darling.
Give it to me. Come on. Not that.

17:48.240 --> 17:52.791
<i>Give it to Mummy. Thank you.
- We have to look after all of them?</i>

17:52.880 --> 17:54.711
Yeah, just until the end of the holiday.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.514
Then I suppose the school will
find them homes.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.192
Well...

18:01.280 --> 18:03.350
all but one of them.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.237
David, I promised.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.719
<i>Karen...</i>

18:11.560 --> 18:13.278
<i>Ramona!</i>

18:13.360 --> 18:15.874
I need you to help me look after the twins.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.673
Morning, Pete. Come and have some breakfast.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.154
Pete's here.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.593
I didn't hear the doorbell.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.756
Hey! Early visit.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.876
Aren't you going to work today?
- Yeah.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.234
So, what's this?

18:47.320 --> 18:49.038
Dress-down Thursday, is it?

18:49.120 --> 18:50.678
Ha, ha.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.115
Here. Have some coffee.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.869
Thanks.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.155
Help yourself to cereal.
- Cheers.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.189
Ramona!

19:05.120 --> 19:07.953
Pete! I think she had someone
in her room last night.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.157
I hope it wasn't the bloke from
the fishmonger's who sniffs round her.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.310
I don't like the look of him or the smell.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.118
Oh, I oversleep.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.997
Argh! You're still here?

19:17.080 --> 19:18.195
Still?

19:18.280 --> 19:20.236
He's only just arrived...

19:23.160 --> 19:25.230
Pete? With Ramona?

19:25.320 --> 19:29.108
Well, they were together at your party.
- Yes, together. But not shagging.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.872
What happened?

19:30.960 --> 19:33.394
She just caught me as I was
jumping the wire.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.074
Do you want some cereal?
There's hardly any left, though.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.230
The Frosties are Josh's.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.470
Well, this is all very embarrassing.
- Why?

19:40.560 --> 19:45.111
Because it crosses the line
between upstairs and downstairs.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.634
I mean, next,
she'll be wanting to join us at table!

19:48.720 --> 19:51.234
Would you excuse me, please?

19:58.400 --> 20:00.356
I could put some toast on, if you like.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.435
No, I'm fine. How about...

20:03.520 --> 20:05.750
No, no. I'll make some later.
- OK.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.590
Bold as brass at breakfast!

20:17.680 --> 20:19.477
Having spent the night...

20:19.560 --> 20:21.232
in her...

20:22.360 --> 20:23.588
<i>...room.</i>

20:24.640 --> 20:26.119
Holy shite!

20:29.720 --> 20:31.278
Do you think they actually did it?

20:36.560 --> 20:38.278
You and your bollocks!

20:38.360 --> 20:41.193
I knew you were seeing her.
I didn't know you were wah-hah!

20:41.280 --> 20:44.511
Thanks. So, I suppose Karen told you.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.068
No, David.
- Then Karen told Rachel.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.435
No, I did. But Rachel told Jenny.

20:49.520 --> 20:52.273
Oh, really? What was her reaction?

20:52.360 --> 20:55.318
Well, shocked, I think.
Followed by feigned indifference.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.958
Feigned?
- That was my take on it.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.996
Not that I was there, of course.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.073
So...
- What?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.713
How was it?
- What?

21:06.880 --> 21:08.632
You know!
- What?

21:15.240 --> 21:18.232
Can you possibly conceive
that nothing actually happened?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.709
In bed with Ramona? Hmm, interesting.

21:27.840 --> 21:28.989
No.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.433
Well, it didn't.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.238
Nothing happened!

21:33.800 --> 21:34.949
Ha ha!

21:40.160 --> 21:42.230
Condoms! I told you to carry condoms!

21:42.320 --> 21:43.719
That wasn't it!

21:43.800 --> 21:46.473
No, no, Ramona would have them, yeah.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.159
So, what was it?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.673
Well, nothing went wrong, it just
went...different.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.035
What do you mean, different?

22:05.160 --> 22:07.469
Ramona, you're a very attractive woman.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.630
Oh, God. This doesn't sound very good.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.999
It's just that I...

22:12.080 --> 22:13.877
I don't feel I'm ready for this.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.269
OK.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.832
Do you want to talk about it some?

22:20.960 --> 22:22.279
So we did.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.873
You talked some?

22:24.720 --> 22:26.358
All night.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.317
All night?
- We had a lot to discuss!

22:28.400 --> 22:31.631
You know what you need, don't you?
- That came up in the conversation.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.950
And Ramona's right up for it.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.069
Well...

22:44.120 --> 22:46.315
This is a gay bar.
- Yeah. It's all right, innit?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.394
Peter!
- Hey!

22:48.480 --> 22:49.879
Two nights running!

22:49.960 --> 22:53.236
Getting in touch with your
dark side, are you?

22:53.320 --> 22:55.072
I left my credit card behind the bar.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.118
His hands are legendary round these parts.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.156
I'm Max.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.831
Adam.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.480
Ooh! The strong, silent type.
- Hmm!

23:07.880 --> 23:09.711
Just tell him you're not gay.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.276
I'm not gay.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.271
Ooh! Deja vu!

23:15.360 --> 23:17.396
It's what my last three boyfriends said.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.394
Hey! Have you phoned number nine yet?

23:21.480 --> 23:23.550
Phoned him? I've had him!

23:27.280 --> 23:30.158
Hi. He's in bed. Will you read him a story?

23:30.240 --> 23:31.878
Can't you do it?

23:31.960 --> 23:35.316
Yeah, yeah, I can, but he's asked for you.

23:36.520 --> 23:40.274
But this is about e-commerce.
I've got to watch this.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.515
Right.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.794
Good.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.358
Hey, what are you doing?
- Robert...

23:49.440 --> 23:51.670
You can't have it both ways.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.034
What do you mean?

23:53.120 --> 23:56.510
You know, there are responsibilities
when you're dealing with a kid.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.318
Hey, lighten up, Jen, I'm not his dad.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.437
No, no, you're not. You're his
best friend, which is much better.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.035
You get to buy him presents. You don't have
to tell him off. Great. Lucky you.

24:05.120 --> 24:09.318
I mean, I've taken a bit of a risk,
letting you get your feet under our table.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.437
And I don't mind getting hurt.
Whatever, I'll live with it. But...

24:12.520 --> 24:14.750
I'm telling you, if you betray
his trust, God!

24:14.840 --> 24:17.559
It's just there's a little boy
up there, you know,

24:17.640 --> 24:19.949
and he's investing in you.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.434
OK.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.755
Postman Pat, here I come.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.312
It's Thomas The Tank Engine.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.079
Great guys.
I wouldn't mind playing football with them.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.354
No.
- Cos they're gay?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.271
Cos they're my friends.
- What?

24:44.360 --> 24:46.157
You've always done this!

24:46.240 --> 24:49.073
When we were at school, I made friends.
You took them away.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.197
I had a hobby. You always did it
better than me.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.111
I'm not even gonna start on Jenny.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.556
Pete, what...? - No! The way you
behaved in there, flirting,

24:57.640 --> 24:59.870
was absolutely outrageous.
- I was not!

24:59.960 --> 25:02.679
That Simon bloke thought
you were making eyes at him.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.716
What? Simon the architect?

25:05.600 --> 25:07.397
God, you're such a tart!

25:13.600 --> 25:16.273
Sure, you know I'd never cheat on you.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.639
Piss off.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.953
Tell you what, though,
that Simon does have lovely eyes.

25:31.120 --> 25:34.908
So, how come he's disappeared
off the radar all these years?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.797
Well, he's been travelling, I suppose.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.836
That's what travel photographers do.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.956
Oh, Karen. Nice job!
- I know.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.032
What exotic location is he
off to next, then?

25:44.120 --> 25:45.553
Manchester.

25:45.640 --> 25:50.270
Apparently, he's got some business up here.
Said he'd look me up, show me his portfolio.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.878
Is that like the modern equivalent
of etchings?

25:55.080 --> 25:58.470
Is he an old flame, then?
- No. Not really.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.630
We were just friends at university.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.790
Shared similar interests.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.753
Out! Out! Out!

26:07.120 --> 26:08.519
Out! Out! Out!

26:08.600 --> 26:11.194
Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Out! Out! Out!

26:17.800 --> 26:20.837
<i>You were a member
of the Socialist Workers'Party?</i>

26:20.920 --> 26:21.955
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:22.040 --> 26:23.598
Local treasurer.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.355
Not that we ever had much money.
It was just a phase I went through, really.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.874
I'd given up trying to smash the system
when I met you.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.110
Too right. You were working for
an ad agency!

26:32.200 --> 26:34.953
I know.
- So you weren't ever, you know, together?

26:35.040 --> 26:37.838
Oh, yeah. We were often together.

26:44.360 --> 26:47.318
There's nothing like a good riot
to make you horny!

26:47.400 --> 26:49.675
We were just never an item.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.149
Being in a couple was boring, wasn't it?

26:52.240 --> 26:56.836
That was what middle-aged people did.
Get married, settle down, have three kids.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.640
Right. Right, who are we seeing?

27:01.720 --> 27:03.312
Paul Colgate and Maureen Banks.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.472
He's director, she's in charge
of the supermarket development.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.915
Excuse me, David.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.558
A question, if I may.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.437
Is it quick?

27:12.520 --> 27:14.511
Well, it's like this.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.752
I really don't mind shutting the wool shop
for an hour or two.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.549
And Winifred Sullivan said
she might be able to pop in later on

27:22.640 --> 27:25.518
after she's been for the check-up
on her artificial hip.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.511
Yes, yes, what's your point, exactly?

27:27.600 --> 27:30.273
Well, why am I here?

27:30.360 --> 27:32.555
To provide a psychological edge.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.232
Oh, dear.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.993
It's in a book I read on
management techniques.

27:37.080 --> 27:41.039
The opposition send two people to the meeting,
we send three for a numerical advantage.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.076
I see.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.869
And...what do I have to say, exactly?

27:46.960 --> 27:50.077
Nothing. On no account are you
to say a word.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.550
In fact, pretend you're mute.

27:53.640 --> 27:56.871
And Maureen's setting up this
particular project.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.155
Ooh, what a lovely view!

27:59.240 --> 28:01.879
I wonder if you can see my shop.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.393
Eleanor,

28:03.480 --> 28:05.755
perhaps you'd like to come
and sit next to me?

28:14.560 --> 28:19.873
Ah, and this is the rest of our team.
There's Alan Hewitt and Rebecca Sanders.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.272
Damn!
They must have read the same book.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.079
<i>Barry Kemp for Dr Grover!</i>

28:39.960 --> 28:42.599
Well, this is the place to come to
if you want to get sick.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.996
What does she want to see us for, anyway?

28:47.080 --> 28:49.036
I don't know. Just called us in.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.630
At least while we're here, we can set up
the next round of turkey basting.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.435
Sorry.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.391
Do you remember when you were young?

29:04.480 --> 29:08.632
In doctors' waiting rooms, there always used
to be a kid with a saucepan stuck on his head.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.358
On telly.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.998
You don't see that any more.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.031
Non-stick pans, I suppose.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.636
Rachel Bradley and Adam Williams.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.549
Hiya. Come to pick Adam up?

29:36.560 --> 29:38.869
Right. Well, I'll just see if he's ready.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.518
Hiya! How are you?

29:48.600 --> 29:51.114
What's he doing here?
- What are you talking about?

29:51.200 --> 29:53.316
Moved in yet, has he?
- Don't be daft!

29:53.400 --> 29:55.356
Then, why are you playing happy families?

29:55.440 --> 29:58.238
Hello, Pete! My life!

29:58.320 --> 30:01.278
Hello! My life! My son!
Calling him Daddy yet, is he?

30:01.360 --> 30:04.670
No! He's calling him Robert,
cos that's his name!

30:04.760 --> 30:09.231
He's being a damn sight more grown-up than
you. Anyway, I hear you're shagging Ramona!

30:09.320 --> 30:10.912
So what if I am?

30:12.600 --> 30:16.388
Um... You all right, love?
Right, be good for Daddy. Love you.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.719
Come on, then.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.793
<i>Cor! Look at you, eh?
You'll be playing for England next!</i>

30:23.880 --> 30:25.996
That must have set Mummy back a bit.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.638
<i>Robert buyed it.</i>

30:27.720 --> 30:28.835
Ah.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.151
I wanted to see you together
because this affects you both.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.440
Before you embarked on the course of ICSI,

30:39.520 --> 30:41.715
we didn't perform any tests on Rachel.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.030
Well, we didn't need to.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.076
It's because of me we're here.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.355
Yeah. We know I can get pregnant.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.429
Yes.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.193
It's always best to check these
things, though.

30:52.280 --> 30:56.319
Which is why,
after we knew the ICSI had failed, we did.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.272
I'm afraid there's a problem.

31:01.400 --> 31:05.518
You're suffering from a condition
known as partial Asherman's.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.953
Sorry?

31:08.040 --> 31:09.792
Well, it's extremely rare.

31:09.880 --> 31:14.635
But sometimes, during the curettage stage
of the D and C following a termination,

31:14.720 --> 31:17.314
the lining of the womb can be damaged.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.756
As a result, little adhesions can develop,

31:20.840 --> 31:24.310
which cause the walls of the uterus
to stick together.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.311
If this happens,

31:26.400 --> 31:30.234
then the chances of conceiving again
are extremely remote.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.313
Well, um...

31:35.160 --> 31:36.639
Can't it be cured?

31:36.720 --> 31:38.870
There is a procedure.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.190
But I'm afraid there's no guarantee
of success.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.919
In fact, I would be misleading you

31:46.000 --> 31:49.788
if I were to give you any cause to think
that this condition can be overcome.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.359
<i>So, um...</i>

31:51.440 --> 31:53.237
Wait, wait.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.311
What about the ICSI?

31:55.400 --> 31:59.916
Can the egg not be fertilised outside
and put back into Rachel?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.309
<i>The sperm you banked
is healthy, yes.</i>

32:02.400 --> 32:07.235
But the apparatus to sustain pregnancy
just does not exist.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.390
I'm sorry, Rachel.
This should have been spotted before.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.837
I can't have children?

32:18.360 --> 32:20.316
It would be most unlikely.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.469
Do you want to go somewhere
and talk about this?

32:39.760 --> 32:41.716
I should be getting back to work.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.554
Me, too.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.316
OK, well, tonight.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.629
Yeah.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.591
The research speaks for itself.

33:17.680 --> 33:23.655
78% of those polled support better shopping
facilities in this part of Altrincham.

33:24.880 --> 33:28.475
I'm sorry, Mr Marsden,
but the people are behind us,

33:28.560 --> 33:29.879
not you.

33:32.200 --> 33:35.988
Hmm. Let's look at this research
a little closer.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.037
The opinion poll...
- Conducted by an independent company.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.633
Paid by you.

33:41.720 --> 33:46.510
..posed the question, ''Would you support
better shopping facilities in Altrincham?''

33:46.600 --> 33:48.750
Well, I mean, who wouldn't?

33:48.840 --> 33:52.071
<i>I'm surprised that only 78% said yes.</i>

33:52.960 --> 33:55.030
Nowhere is it mentioned

33:55.120 --> 33:58.396
that in order to provide these so-called
''better shopping facilities,''

33:58.480 --> 34:01.597
a children's playground
would have to be bulldozed.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.479
Did you tell them about that?

34:06.680 --> 34:08.830
As a measure of public opinion,

34:08.920 --> 34:10.956
this document is worthless.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.311
Whereas this petition...

34:14.400 --> 34:18.029
truly represents the views of
the local residents.

34:18.120 --> 34:21.795
1134 individual names and addresses.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.188
This is the will of the people, Mr Colgate.

34:24.280 --> 34:27.158
And your company ignores it at its peril.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.071
Peril is the word!

34:31.719 --> 34:36.032
Because the people are not about
to fall silent on this issue.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.190
If you press ahead with these plans,

34:38.280 --> 34:40.998
you will meet opposition at every turn.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.311
When you arrive for work,
there will be pickets outside this building.

34:44.400 --> 34:49.393
Local residents will occupy the playgrounds
and lie down in front of your bulldozers.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.233
Children will padlock themselves
to the climbing frames.

34:52.320 --> 34:57.030
You'll need wire-cutters to release them.
- Bet you'd like that on the six o'clock news!

34:57.120 --> 35:01.511
Our MP will lobby the Secretary of State
and we will seek a judicial review.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.672
Oh, and we shall write
to each and every one of your shareholders.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.513
I believe that your next AGM
is at the end of July.

35:07.600 --> 35:11.639
Well, it's amazing what a bit of bad
publicity can do to your share price.

35:11.720 --> 35:15.429
And when the stocks are falling,
who will be the first victim?

35:16.440 --> 35:20.194
The British Empire
underestimated Mahatma Gandhi.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.430
Don't make the same mistake.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.751
We are a problem you do not need.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.232
You were magnificent!
- You were masterful!

35:36.320 --> 35:38.390
And you, Eleanor, played it just right.

35:38.480 --> 35:41.392
I didn't do anything!
- That's right. You were perfect.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.118
Let's go and celebrate.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.476
Taxi!
- I ought to be getting back to the shop.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.915
Oh. Fair enough. Well done!

35:49.000 --> 35:50.638
Well done!

36:13.360 --> 36:15.396
No! I can't go through with this!

36:16.480 --> 36:18.675
Yes, you can! Yes, you can!
- No!

36:18.760 --> 36:20.716
Take us to a hotel!
- No!

36:21.720 --> 36:24.473
I've never... I've never been
unfaithful to Karen.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.078
<i>Put me down here, will you?</i>

36:31.480 --> 36:33.436
I'm sorry.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.838
Well, that's that, then.
- Yes.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.229
The battle is over. The war is won.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.788
We've got no reason to keep
seeing each other.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.718
Unless you'd consider joining
the Labour Party.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.793
You know, I don't think
the Labour Party is quite me.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.438
Right.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.389
Well...

37:04.480 --> 37:06.436
Goodbye, then.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.108
Lunch.

37:12.200 --> 37:15.476
I mean...no harm in lunch, is there?

37:15.560 --> 37:16.754
No, no.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.831
Yeah, I'd like that.

37:18.920 --> 37:22.959
Well, you've got my card. Call me.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.078
<i>Philip.</i>

37:54.000 --> 37:55.956
Don't mention Jenny.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.429
Don't think of Jenny.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.231
Jenny is in the past.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.433
Jenny...

38:03.520 --> 38:05.192
no longer...

38:05.280 --> 38:06.998
exists.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.758
That'll be Jenny...er, Ramona.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.035
That'll be Ramona. Yes.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.112
Do you ever wonder
how your life might be different?

38:22.040 --> 38:23.632
What do you mean?

38:23.720 --> 38:27.110
Well, you know, if you'd made
different choices in your life.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.156
The road less travelled.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.913
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.189
Well, say we hadn't met.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.953
We did meet.
- Yeah, but say we hadn't.

38:42.280 --> 38:45.158
I was quite a different person
before you came along.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.038
Yeah, your hippy-dippy phase.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.236
All kaftans and Jethro Tull.

38:53.880 --> 38:57.429
I've never done much with my life.
Never travelled.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.875
We went skiing last year.

38:59.960 --> 39:03.157
David, skiing's not travelling.
I'm talking about the Himalayas, K2.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.037
That sort of thing.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.948
You?

39:09.720 --> 39:11.915
I might have done if I was with Brodie.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.956
<i>Oh, yeah, I can see that!</i>

39:18.720 --> 39:21.075
<i>Where's my lip balm?</i>

39:21.160 --> 39:22.388
What?

39:22.480 --> 39:25.950
My strawberry lip balm! Where is it?

39:26.840 --> 39:28.114
Oh, piss off!

39:29.440 --> 39:30.589
<i>Hi!</i>

39:31.520 --> 39:33.715
<i>Hi, Ramona. Have a nice evening?</i>

39:33.800 --> 39:35.233
Yeah.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.799
I see Pete.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.633
Oh, yeah?
- How was it?

39:41.040 --> 39:42.109
Well...

39:51.080 --> 39:53.674
I don't think this is... this is
working, no?

39:53.760 --> 39:55.432
No, no, no. It will.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.795
Just give it time.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.189
Pete, I'm sorry, but I can't
do this any more!

40:00.280 --> 40:02.077
This?
- Yeah, this.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.799
You know, this threesome.
- What?

40:04.880 --> 40:06.359
You, me, Jenny.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.949
<i>No, Pete and I,
we decided to call it a night.</i>

40:11.040 --> 40:14.669
No. You've called it a day.
- I'm sorry, Ramona.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.232
Ah, don't worry about it.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.470
Anyway, good night.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.672
At least that saves any further
embarrassment over breakfast.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.278
God Almighty!

40:29.360 --> 40:32.796
To think I once wanted
to smash the class system.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.154
Is there no chance she can get pregnant?

40:38.960 --> 40:41.076
Not unless you believe in miracles.

40:41.160 --> 40:44.118
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.553
Mmm.

40:46.480 --> 40:50.598
I wouldn't even dump this on you
but you know what Pete's like.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.114
So, how's it going with the UVF?

40:55.240 --> 40:59.074
IVF. I'm borderline impotent,
not a member of the loyalist paramilitaries.

40:59.160 --> 41:02.516
Oh-ho! The trivia machine's free.
Come on, 20 pound jackpot.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.511
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

41:05.280 --> 41:06.952
Well, I'm listening.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.678
How's Rachel?

41:12.520 --> 41:13.748
Rachel!

41:20.840 --> 41:23.195
We're not talking at the moment.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.157
I think you should talk about it.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.676
We did, last night.
That's why we're not talking at the moment.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.432
Do you blame me?

41:33.160 --> 41:34.878
Blame you?

41:36.640 --> 41:38.278
No, I don't blame you.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.039
All the same,

41:44.120 --> 41:46.076
it makes you think.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.194
What?

41:57.480 --> 41:58.879
Well, you know...

42:01.320 --> 42:02.548
Say it.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.474
Say it!

42:15.320 --> 42:16.992
<i>Do you blame her?</i>

42:17.920 --> 42:20.195
She was pregnant, maybe with my baby.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.510
She had an abortion.
Now we can't have children.

42:23.520 --> 42:26.114
Don't you think I've got reason
to blame her?

42:27.200 --> 42:29.714
It's enough to make you believe there's a God.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.950
Yeah. Certainly a Catholic one.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.830
It's the school bunny.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.997
There are so many of them.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.638
Yeah, I know.

42:45.720 --> 42:47.278
They breed like rabbits.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.749
Rachel, I'm so sorry.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.796
Do you want me to put them outside?

43:06.440 --> 43:08.032
The thing is...

43:09.080 --> 43:11.753
..I can live with destroying my own life.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.876
But destroying Adam's?

43:15.080 --> 43:17.958
You are not destroying Adam's life.

43:19.080 --> 43:20.752
I so wanted to be a father.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.996
I wanted to be a daddy.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.313
<i>The first Williams to play for Man United.</i>

43:29.160 --> 43:31.037
Carlisle United would have done.

43:32.760 --> 43:35.957
Now, your man there is the closest I'll get
to handing my name down.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.351
I had lunch with Brodie today.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.078
How was it?

43:44.760 --> 43:46.113
Interesting.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.190
I was really worried before we met.

43:49.280 --> 43:52.397
I was frlghtened I'd be
resentful of my life,

43:52.480 --> 43:54.118
jealous of his.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.509
Been to Mongolia?
- Um...

43:56.600 --> 43:58.079
No.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.071
I think I'd remember if I had.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.390
Fabulous country. You should go.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.789
With three children under the age of four?

44:04.880 --> 44:07.348
<i>And are you?
- You look fantastic.</i>

44:07.440 --> 44:10.637
<i>No. Our lives are different, that's all.</i>

44:10.720 --> 44:12.915
He gets to travel the world.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.231
Never spends more than a week in one place.

44:17.480 --> 44:18.913
But he hasn't got a home.

44:22.440 --> 44:24.431
I suppose what I'm saying is,

44:24.520 --> 44:28.115
there's no point in regretting
the choices you made in your life.

44:29.080 --> 44:32.390
Because at the time you made them,
they seemed like the only option.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.630
You can't control what follows.

44:38.280 --> 44:39.554
I've got to go.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.033
I need to see Adam.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.712
Shit!

44:47.800 --> 44:49.791
I think I've just killed a rabbit.

44:51.120 --> 44:54.112
You know, it's crossed my mind
to leave her, walk away.

44:54.880 --> 44:59.271
Maybe there's someone else out there I could
fall in love with. Maybe we could have children.

44:59.360 --> 45:02.796
That's not what a nice person does.
A nice person doesn't do that.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.075
You're bound to think that. Everyone would.

45:05.160 --> 45:08.755
They didn't have any Leerdammer,
so I got Emmenthal instead.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.990
Can I five minutes?

45:13.200 --> 45:15.236
Do you want to come and give me a hand?

45:15.320 --> 45:16.435
<i>Yeah?</i>

45:17.240 --> 45:18.832
Come on.

45:18.920 --> 45:22.071
I have got some chocolate ice cream for you.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.793
He's got a key?

45:29.800 --> 45:33.110
Not all the time.
- Ah, jeez, Jenny!

45:33.200 --> 45:37.079
When did we all start making
such a bollocks of our lives?

45:38.560 --> 45:40.232
Don't know.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.231
Weren't concentrating
and it just caught up with us, I think.

45:45.360 --> 45:46.395
No.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.436
We did it to ourselves.

46:43.960 --> 46:45.234
Hey you.

46:49.480 --> 46:52.392
I don't think it's right that
I stop you from having a family.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.391
I think we should split up.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.316
Marry me.
