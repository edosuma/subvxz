WEBVTT

00:01.944 --> 00:03.319
Get out!

00:03.990 --> 00:05.075
What the hell's happened?

00:05.137 --> 00:08.177
Girl says she's been held in a cellar
and assaulted for the last four days.

00:08.266 --> 00:09.625
I'm arresting you on suspicion

00:09.626 --> 00:11.705
of abduction
and demanding money with menaces.

00:11.706 --> 00:14.105
Have you done a deal?
I want to know...

00:14.106 --> 00:15.905
if you've sold us down the river.

00:15.906 --> 00:19.345
Tommy Lee Royce is still
on his toes and so is Lewis Whippey.

00:19.346 --> 00:22.225
We will get him, Catherine.

00:22.226 --> 00:24.785
It's your birthday next week.
D'you fancy doing something?

00:24.786 --> 00:26.225
No, not really.

00:26.226 --> 00:30.145
What you've got to understand
is that granny's... still poorly.

00:30.146 --> 00:31.945
'What kind of life is that?

00:31.946 --> 00:35.265
'Living with an old woman
and no dad? That's no life.'

00:35.266 --> 00:37.306
Not for a lad.

01:47.466 --> 01:49.266
I'll wait in the car.

01:50.346 --> 01:51.386
Yeah.

01:56.906 --> 01:59.505
Nevison? Sorry to disturb,
but I thought you'd want to know.

01:59.506 --> 02:01.666
Sergeant Cawood's here,
she's asking to see you.

02:03.626 --> 02:05.025
Catherine!

02:05.026 --> 02:07.945
Hello. Sorry, are you busy?

02:07.946 --> 02:09.905
No. Er, I can wait...

02:09.906 --> 02:12.625
No! No, I'm never too busy.

02:12.626 --> 02:15.585
Fellas, can we do this later?

02:15.586 --> 02:17.185
How are you?

02:17.186 --> 02:19.065
Oh, I'm... I'm...

02:19.066 --> 02:22.065
We were wanting to come
and see you in the hospital, but...

02:22.066 --> 02:23.785
Wasn't worth looking at.

02:23.786 --> 02:25.425
D'you want to...? Sure.

02:25.426 --> 02:28.225
Would you like some tea, or...?

02:28.226 --> 02:30.546
Er, tea, yeah. Thank you.

02:34.706 --> 02:36.665
So...

02:36.666 --> 02:38.545
you got my message?

02:38.546 --> 02:40.785
Sorry, which?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.505
I spoke to Clare.

02:42.506 --> 02:47.665
I wanted you to know, if ever there
is anything I can do for you...

02:47.666 --> 02:49.825
Ever. Anything.

02:49.826 --> 02:52.865
She suggested paying off
your mortgage. How much do you owe?

02:52.866 --> 02:54.985
You're not paying me mortgage off,
don't be silly.

02:54.986 --> 02:57.705
You can't begin to understand
how much pleasure it would give us

02:57.706 --> 02:59.305
to be able to do something like that.

02:59.306 --> 03:01.945
Oh, she was... she was joking.
I don't think she was.

03:01.946 --> 03:04.985
I was doing me job.
I don't... I don't think it'd be...

03:04.986 --> 03:07.265
What? You know, ethical, appropriate.

03:07.266 --> 03:09.185
Not that I'm not grateful, but...

03:09.186 --> 03:11.705
I'd like to do something.

03:11.706 --> 03:13.626
Sure, but that isn't why I'm here.

03:18.346 --> 03:20.865
Ann came to see me. In hospital.

03:20.866 --> 03:23.505
Ann did? I thought...

03:23.506 --> 03:25.385
No, she got in. I wasn't...

03:25.386 --> 03:28.505
seeing people, but she got in.

03:28.506 --> 03:31.345
I didn't mind, I was pleased
to see her.

03:31.346 --> 03:33.346
But then she told me something.

03:36.986 --> 03:38.505
Something that was difficult.

03:38.506 --> 03:41.505
Something that she wanted, erm...

03:41.506 --> 03:44.385
But she couldn't face
telling you herself,

03:44.386 --> 03:45.946
so... she asked me to.

03:47.466 --> 03:49.106
So, erm...

03:53.826 --> 03:54.866
She was raped.

03:57.986 --> 04:01.265
One of them, Tommy Lee Royce,

04:01.266 --> 04:02.466
he raped her.

04:03.986 --> 04:08.105
When it goes to trial,
and it will, we will get him.

04:08.106 --> 04:10.225
When it goes to trial,
you'll need to know that.

04:10.226 --> 04:14.145
Because you don't want to be hearing
it for the first time in court.

04:14.146 --> 04:16.144
So...

04:16.146 --> 04:19.305
she doesn't want her mum to know.
Because...

04:21.426 --> 04:24.425
..Helen might never need to know.
Might she?

04:24.426 --> 04:25.666
No.

04:26.946 --> 04:28.666
But you do need to know.

04:30.586 --> 04:33.666
So she asked me to tell you that,
because she couldn't.

04:35.186 --> 04:37.785
She's tough, she's clever,
she's dealing with it.

04:37.786 --> 04:41.786
But the hardest part for her now
was not knowing how to tell you.

06:18.866 --> 06:19.906
Cheers.

06:24.626 --> 06:25.945
Where are they?

06:25.946 --> 06:27.025
Who?

06:27.026 --> 06:29.585
I thought they had you
"under observation" at all times?

06:29.586 --> 06:32.186
Sh!! I don't know,
they'll be somewhere.

06:42.186 --> 06:43.545
What you doing?!

06:43.546 --> 06:45.906
Get off me, bastard! You bastard!

06:47.346 --> 06:50.346
Nothing... to do... with me! Stop it!

07:47.866 --> 07:49.226
You wanted to see me?

07:52.786 --> 07:54.505
Put your seat belt on.

07:54.506 --> 07:56.145
Where're you living?

07:56.146 --> 07:57.346
Is that my son?

07:58.746 --> 08:00.465
That's my lad.

08:00.466 --> 08:01.785
Nothing to do with you.

08:01.786 --> 08:03.785
You know me and your Becky
had a thing going on?

08:03.786 --> 08:05.425
You twisted little bastard!

08:05.426 --> 08:07.986
I know what you did to her
because she told me.

08:09.466 --> 08:12.385
Hey! You're my son, I'm your dad!

08:12.386 --> 08:14.105
You're my son, Ryan!

08:14.106 --> 08:15.705
Ryan!

08:15.706 --> 08:18.665
I knew your mum!

08:18.666 --> 08:21.545
"I knew something
wonderful was going to happen,"

08:21.546 --> 08:24.865
said Bobbie, "but I didn't think
it was going to be this.

08:24.866 --> 08:28.065
"Oh, my daddy, my daddy!

08:28.066 --> 08:31.065
"Then didn't Mother get my letter?"
Father asked.

08:31.066 --> 08:33.424
"There weren't any letters
this morning.

08:33.426 --> 08:36.985
"Oh, Daddy! It is really you,
isn't it?"

08:36.986 --> 08:41.346
The clasp of a hand she had not
forgotten assured her that it was.

08:42.426 --> 08:44.505
"They've caught the man who did it.

08:44.506 --> 08:47.106
"Everyone knows now
that it wasn't your daddy."

08:48.586 --> 08:51.746
"I always knew it wasn't,"
said Bobbie.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.306
Hiya.

09:38.266 --> 09:39.985
How's things?

09:39.986 --> 09:41.906
Not so bad. Better than they were.

09:43.066 --> 09:44.745
Is she all right?

09:44.746 --> 09:46.425
Well, we're getting there.

09:46.426 --> 09:48.826
Slowly, I think.

09:50.106 --> 09:53.505
It'll help when they've tracked down
Tommy bloody Lee Royce.

09:53.506 --> 09:56.745
That's why I want to talk to you,
actually.

09:56.746 --> 09:59.266
Er, just a cup of tea. Thank you.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.905
Yeah, it's her birthday next week.

10:02.906 --> 10:06.425
You know what she's like,
but I've persuaded her...

10:06.426 --> 10:07.825
Given that...

10:07.826 --> 10:09.265
You see, it's the Gallaghers,

10:09.266 --> 10:11.385
they're just so desperate
to say thank you.

10:11.386 --> 10:16.425
So, just us, just family,
and Ann, Helen and Nevison.

10:16.426 --> 10:18.465
Great.

10:18.466 --> 10:20.586
Blimey, Nevison Gallagher!

10:21.906 --> 10:24.305
So, you and Lucy...? Yeah!

10:24.306 --> 10:26.465
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

10:26.466 --> 10:28.545
I know it's been difficult
in the past, but...

10:28.546 --> 10:31.305
We've talked a lot, me and Lucy.

10:31.306 --> 10:35.065
And when the baby's born,
we want everything to be right.

10:35.066 --> 10:37.985
For the baby's sake.
Well, for everybody's sake.

10:37.986 --> 10:39.306
They will be.

10:41.026 --> 10:44.186
I really... didn't want her to die.

10:45.706 --> 10:46.825
In hospital.

10:46.826 --> 10:49.745
I know, love, I was there.

10:49.746 --> 10:52.785
She'll be a good grandmother.
I know that.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.905
So...

10:54.906 --> 10:56.985
OK, this is the thing...

10:56.986 --> 10:59.265
Should I invite your dad and Ros?

10:59.266 --> 11:02.465
Erm, yeah, why not?
If Mum's good with that.

11:02.466 --> 11:04.265
Yeah.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.545
OK, thing is...

11:06.546 --> 11:09.465
I will do... I can do, obviously.

11:09.466 --> 11:11.386
Only... What?

11:14.066 --> 11:16.226
She's been seeing him again,
your dad.

11:17.986 --> 11:20.106
Seeing...? As in...

11:21.546 --> 11:23.226
..sex? Yeah.

11:29.066 --> 11:31.666
So it... It's just a bit...

11:33.186 --> 11:35.505
I hate arranging parties.

11:35.506 --> 11:38.505
I just thought she could do
with a tonic.

11:38.506 --> 11:40.345
I mean, God, you know,
she nearly died.

11:40.346 --> 11:42.225
And she saved someone's life.

11:42.226 --> 11:45.985
So, thing is,
I can't invite him and not Ros.

11:45.986 --> 11:47.905
Invite who you like.

11:47.906 --> 11:49.105
I was asking for an opinion.

11:49.106 --> 11:50.865
Clearly I'm not party
to the ins and outs.

11:50.866 --> 11:52.905
No, I know, but...

11:52.906 --> 11:57.065
No, you can't invite me dad
and not Ros.

11:57.066 --> 11:58.585
But why invite either of 'em if...?

11:58.586 --> 12:02.705
Well, they were very good wi' Ryan
when Catherine were in hospital.

12:02.706 --> 12:04.185
Ryan?

12:04.186 --> 12:05.466
Yeah.

12:07.986 --> 12:11.385
Why's me dad seeing her again?
Is he stupid?

12:11.386 --> 12:12.946
It was before all this.

12:14.226 --> 12:17.105
It... It was after he found out
he was losing his job.

12:17.106 --> 12:18.266
At t'Gazette.

12:20.546 --> 12:22.065
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:22.066 --> 12:24.346
I've put me bloody foot in it,
haven't I?

12:58.146 --> 13:01.385
Go! DC 9224,
urgent assistance required.

13:01.386 --> 13:04.065
We've got a shooting on the A629.

13:04.066 --> 13:06.305
Ambulance requested,
helicopter requested.

13:06.306 --> 13:09.265
Shit! There's two suspects
on a motorbike,

13:09.266 --> 13:12.706
heading along the A629 Halifax Road
towards Huddersfield.

13:41.186 --> 13:43.025
We've got to go t'Nisa. Why?

13:43.026 --> 13:45.625
Just a few bits and pieces
for tonight

13:45.626 --> 13:48.026
that Clare's gone and forgotten.

13:49.346 --> 13:51.345
Can I have some sweets?

13:51.346 --> 13:53.545
You been good? Yeah.

13:53.546 --> 13:55.186
All day? Yes.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.346
Can I stay up late?

14:07.346 --> 14:08.386
For a bit. If you behave.

14:09.506 --> 14:11.745
Is me Grandad coming?

14:11.746 --> 14:14.705
Yep. Is Ros coming?

14:14.706 --> 14:16.506
Yeah. I like Ros.

14:38.626 --> 14:41.185
When WAS this?
Last week. She came to see me.

14:41.186 --> 14:43.425
Yes, but when did you stop
his salary?

14:43.426 --> 14:45.265
As soon as they arrested him.

14:45.266 --> 14:47.545
Is that legal?

14:47.546 --> 14:49.065
But surely she's right?

14:49.066 --> 14:51.905
We don't know how culpable he was.
Or wasn't.

14:51.906 --> 14:55.745
Well, if she wants it,
she can take legal action.

14:55.746 --> 14:58.185
She uses a wheelchair.

14:58.186 --> 15:00.385
None of it was her doing, was it?

15:00.386 --> 15:03.025
Her or the children. No.

15:03.026 --> 15:05.545
But, as I explained to her,

15:05.546 --> 15:10.305
actions - his actions -
have consequences.

15:10.306 --> 15:12.505
That'll be them.

15:12.506 --> 15:15.145
In the mouth? Shot in the mouth?

15:15.146 --> 15:16.546
I didn't see the...

15:17.626 --> 15:18.705
..body meself.

15:18.706 --> 15:20.665
I mean, we attended,
but by that time,

15:20.666 --> 15:23.825
you know, it's all cordoned off
so we don't go nowhere near.

15:23.826 --> 15:25.746
But that wasn't on the news,
the mouth thing.

15:31.546 --> 15:32.945
Or... Oh, yeah.

15:32.946 --> 15:34.865
..it can be a thing. A what?

15:34.866 --> 15:36.105
You're a journalist.

15:36.106 --> 15:39.225
No longer, Joyce!
As of last week, redundant.

15:39.226 --> 15:41.745
What "thing"? Like... a message.

15:41.746 --> 15:43.785
To anyone else.

15:43.786 --> 15:45.905
If you grass, if you talk...

15:45.906 --> 15:47.785
..this is what happens.
Good grief.

15:47.786 --> 15:48.945
My God!

15:48.946 --> 15:51.585
Do people...? Does that really...?
Yeah!

15:51.586 --> 15:52.625
So, who did it?

15:52.626 --> 15:55.425
Colonel Mustard and Professor Plum.

15:55.426 --> 15:57.626
On a Honda!
With the lead pipe!

15:59.426 --> 16:00.745
If they knew who did it,

16:00.746 --> 16:03.826
then they would've arrested 'em,
wouldn't they? Duh!

16:06.386 --> 16:08.025
He's in here.

16:08.026 --> 16:12.385
Erm, Helen, Ann and Nevison are here.

16:12.386 --> 16:14.585
Hi... Evening. Evening.

16:14.586 --> 16:17.145
Catherine's just through there,
if you wanted to...

16:17.146 --> 16:18.466
Ah, this is my wife.

16:21.506 --> 16:22.586
Hi.

16:24.626 --> 16:25.666
Hello.

16:32.146 --> 16:34.065
How are you all?

16:34.066 --> 16:35.546
Alive.

16:38.426 --> 16:39.946
Hello, Catherine.

16:51.466 --> 16:54.905
Your son looks young,
you must have had him late.

16:54.906 --> 16:58.105
Ryan? He's not me son,
he's me grandson.

16:58.106 --> 17:01.145
Daniel's me son.
The one who's drinking too much.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.786
Oh, I thought he was like me -
a late arrival.

17:04.866 --> 17:08.385
She couldn't get pregnant for long
enough, so she had IVF in her 40s.

17:08.386 --> 17:11.865
Hence me looking like
I hang around with my grandparents.

17:11.866 --> 17:14.746
I was a long-anticipated
disappointment.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.506
Why are you a disappointment?

17:19.465 --> 17:22.944
Hundreds of millions of pounds
spent on my education,

17:22.945 --> 17:25.626
and here I am,
unnecessary and unemployed.

17:26.986 --> 17:29.705
I graduated from the Royal Northern
last year with a 2:1,

17:29.706 --> 17:31.346
which qualifies me for nothing.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.345
Unless I want to teach,
which, frankly,

17:34.346 --> 17:36.185
I'd rather stick hot pins in me eyes.

17:36.186 --> 17:37.945
And get gang-raped.

17:37.946 --> 17:39.625
I speak from experience.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.226
Well, not gang rape, but...

17:42.386 --> 17:43.426
..you know.

17:46.386 --> 17:47.705
How're you coping?

17:47.706 --> 17:48.946
I'm coping.

17:50.426 --> 17:53.105
I have to, for my mother's sake.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.346
Which is good.

17:55.706 --> 17:59.266
What happened says more about him
than it'll ever say about me.

18:01.066 --> 18:04.545
And I'm not pregnant
and I haven't got AIDS, so...

18:04.546 --> 18:05.786
It's a good attitude.

18:07.666 --> 18:09.345
Women so often blame themselves.

18:09.346 --> 18:13.105
God knows why... but they do.
It's ridiculous.

18:13.106 --> 18:15.106
In almost every circumstance.

18:18.186 --> 18:19.426
You're very rare.

18:20.786 --> 18:22.466
I just want them to catch him.

18:24.066 --> 18:25.426
We will.

18:42.946 --> 18:44.946
Are you all right, lad?

18:46.466 --> 18:50.105
I'm assuming Ros doesn't know you've
been at it again with me mother.

18:50.106 --> 18:51.226
What makes you...?

18:52.266 --> 18:54.265
Where've you got that from?

18:54.266 --> 18:57.665
So you're all happy little families
with Ryan now, are you?

18:57.666 --> 19:00.825
We've... been helping out,
while your mum's been poorly.

19:00.826 --> 19:02.106
Liar.

19:03.546 --> 19:06.585
I thought you got it, but... Jesus.

19:06.586 --> 19:09.105
Got what? The damage.

19:09.106 --> 19:13.065
The damage done when she decided
to take on that... thing.

19:13.066 --> 19:14.545
Daniel, you've had a lot to drink.

19:14.546 --> 19:16.625
You're talking louder than
you might realise.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.465
You're as warped as she is.

19:18.466 --> 19:20.425
I'm lost. You've lost me.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.705
I don't know what's going on,
can you start at the beginning?

19:23.706 --> 19:26.505
What's the matter?
Have you forgotten?

19:26.506 --> 19:28.665
That thing she said to me?

19:28.666 --> 19:31.545
No. No, I haven't forgotten, Daniel,
but...

19:31.546 --> 19:34.985
Oh, hello. Here he is,
the thing that shouldn't exist.

19:34.986 --> 19:36.025
Eh?

19:36.026 --> 19:37.945
Why don't you and me
go and get some fresh air?

19:37.946 --> 19:40.465
Don't. Hey, you can sod off!

19:40.466 --> 19:43.225
Shit. Now look what you've done.

19:43.226 --> 19:46.025
You know, I couldn't believe it
when she told me.

19:46.026 --> 19:47.185
When Clare told me.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.985
I thought of all the people
who understood, you did.

19:50.986 --> 19:52.985
And then you just get back
into bed with her.

19:52.986 --> 19:55.425
What's going on?
He's got glass everywhere.

19:55.426 --> 19:57.625
- What's the matter?
- What's going on?

19:57.626 --> 19:59.305
Daniel's...

19:59.306 --> 20:02.665
He's had a bit to drink. Why don't
you take Ryan upstairs, Catherine?

20:02.666 --> 20:04.385
Why, what's up, Daniel?
Yeah, go on,

20:04.386 --> 20:06.505
sod off to bed, you little twat!

20:06.506 --> 20:08.785
And you can piss off an' all,
you old bitch.

20:08.786 --> 20:12.385
Do you want to take Ryan upstairs
and I'll, er, deal with this?

20:12.386 --> 20:13.985
Oh, you'll "deal with this"?!

20:13.986 --> 20:16.825
Come on, lovey. Do you think?

20:16.826 --> 20:18.945
D'you want to calm down?

20:18.946 --> 20:22.025
You know, I wasn't talking to you.
I stopped talking to you years ago.

20:22.026 --> 20:23.625
I know, but you've smashed
a bottle...

20:23.626 --> 20:25.385
Oh, you know?
You've had a bit to drink...

20:25.386 --> 20:28.185
You know sod all! I don't want you
hurting yourself or anyone else.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.625
Don't talk to me like some numpty

20:29.626 --> 20:31.665
that you've just picked up
off the street

20:31.666 --> 20:34.625
for being off their head
in a gutter! Daniel!

20:34.626 --> 20:37.105
Sorry about this, we're just
having a bit of a domestic.

20:37.106 --> 20:38.466
What's going on?

20:40.066 --> 20:42.585
Oh, you can shut yourself in there
with that lot, you can.

20:42.586 --> 20:46.145
It's not even you I'm interested in,
I wrote you off years ago.

20:46.146 --> 20:49.465
It's him I'm disappointed about.
Mm, why?

20:49.466 --> 20:51.385
You're going to start believing
all this

20:51.386 --> 20:54.385
Holy Saint Becky of Assisi shit
next, Dad. Same as her.

20:54.386 --> 20:57.265
He's upset because we've had Ryan
round at our house.

20:57.266 --> 20:58.905
It's not about him.

20:58.906 --> 21:00.625
It's about you.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.986
I thought you got it. All of it!

21:04.226 --> 21:06.185
Becky was a loser.

21:06.186 --> 21:07.905
She ran rings round you!

21:07.906 --> 21:11.425
She hung around with wasters
and pill-heads and bloody idiots

21:11.426 --> 21:12.866
and she was asking for it!

21:14.186 --> 21:17.145
Shouldn't say that in front of
your mother, she doesn't like it.

21:17.146 --> 21:19.905
We wouldn't want her to stop
believing her own shit, would we?

21:19.906 --> 21:21.986
She was asking for it, Mother!

21:23.306 --> 21:25.665
She liked him. She told me.

21:25.666 --> 21:27.146
She were that stupid.

21:28.426 --> 21:29.705
What's going on?

21:29.706 --> 21:31.185
All my...

21:31.186 --> 21:34.745
What's going on is, all my life,
I behave.

21:34.746 --> 21:36.625
I do well in school, well enough.

21:36.626 --> 21:39.665
I keep me head down, never give you
a minute's bother, either of you.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.346
And what thanks do I get?

21:43.186 --> 21:46.745
I get, "Why didn't YOU die, Daniel?

21:46.746 --> 21:48.306
"Why wasn't it YOU?"

21:58.626 --> 22:01.105
If I ever said that, I...
"If"?!

22:01.106 --> 22:03.905
There's no "if".
He knows, he were there.

22:03.906 --> 22:07.105
Or perhaps you want to rewrite
that bit now as well, now, Dad? Eh?

22:07.106 --> 22:10.065
If I ever said that,
I've already apologised.

22:10.066 --> 22:12.585
And no-one believes all this
bereavement crap.

22:12.586 --> 22:14.985
Nobody that matters.
We know, we were there.

22:14.986 --> 22:17.345
We know it's not sorrow.

22:17.346 --> 22:20.425
It's guilt.
And you couldn't stop her.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.425
Becky was off the rails,
she were driving you up the wall,

22:23.426 --> 22:25.305
and there was nothing you could do!

22:25.306 --> 22:27.905
So stop trying to convince yourself
and everyone else

22:27.906 --> 22:29.625
that she was something she wasn't.

22:29.626 --> 22:32.266
She was a stupid, selfish
little bitch!

22:33.386 --> 22:35.905
Do you think
she gave a toss about you?

22:35.906 --> 22:38.465
Have some respect for those of us
who were there,

22:38.466 --> 22:39.866
and who knew the truth.

22:43.706 --> 22:45.026
Right.

22:51.906 --> 22:52.946
We're leaving.

22:54.346 --> 22:55.866
I've had it with these two.

22:57.706 --> 22:59.346
Both as mental as each other.

23:04.946 --> 23:08.705
I'm really sorry. But, you know,

23:08.706 --> 23:11.385
that wasn't a great thing
to say to someone.

23:11.386 --> 23:13.265
She'd just died, I was off me head,

23:13.266 --> 23:15.146
I don't even remember saying it.

23:22.906 --> 23:24.826
Bye. Bye.

23:38.026 --> 23:40.106
You all right? Our Daniel...

23:41.626 --> 23:44.306
How the hell could he know
about me and Richard?

23:46.466 --> 23:48.465
OK.

23:48.466 --> 23:49.906
Thing is...

23:56.306 --> 23:57.706
..it might have been me.

23:58.986 --> 24:00.066
It was me.

24:01.346 --> 24:02.426
What do you mean?

24:04.786 --> 24:07.825
OK, because I didn't know whether
you'd want me to invite Ros,

24:07.826 --> 24:10.145
and Richard.
And we were chatting, and...

24:10.146 --> 24:12.545
But you know our Daniel
can't stand me.

24:12.546 --> 24:14.105
No, Catherine, that's not true.

24:14.106 --> 24:17.105
It's a miracle he didn't yell it out
in front of Ros!

24:17.106 --> 24:19.265
About me and Richard!
Bloody hell, Clare!

24:19.266 --> 24:22.225
Catherine, when you were in that
operating theatre all them hours,

24:22.226 --> 24:24.945
he was really, really upset.
And so what if I did say that?

24:24.946 --> 24:27.025
It's true. Don't say that!

24:27.026 --> 24:28.905
Oh, he was always
so jealous of her. Who?

24:28.906 --> 24:31.225
BECKY! Oh, wh...

24:31.226 --> 24:32.785
You shouldn't say things like that!

24:32.786 --> 24:34.185
Oh, what do you know?

24:34.186 --> 24:36.385
Well... well, to be fair,
he might have been jealous

24:36.386 --> 24:38.505
of the fact that she always hogged
the limelight.

24:38.506 --> 24:41.705
Especially where you were concerned.
I don't know why I ever listen

24:41.706 --> 24:42.905
to a single word you say!

24:42.906 --> 24:45.425
I SAID I didn't want
a sodding party!

24:45.426 --> 24:46.785
Fine, all right. I'm sorry.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.105
I just wanted to do something
for you, I just...

24:49.106 --> 24:50.386
I'm going to bed.

25:00.306 --> 25:02.905
You know, you really ought to
start thinking about

25:02.906 --> 25:04.706
finding your own place to live.

25:58.026 --> 25:59.706
Morning. Morning.

26:06.306 --> 26:09.745
Ryan's been asking if he can start
coming home by himself.

26:09.746 --> 26:11.265
Not by myself!

26:11.266 --> 26:13.866
With Cesco, on us bikes.

26:17.226 --> 26:19.145
You'll have to remember
to wear your helmet

26:19.146 --> 26:21.865
and not just leave it somewhere.
But I'll look like a geek!

26:21.866 --> 26:23.905
And a fluorescent jacket.

26:23.906 --> 26:27.145
And you use the same route
we always use home.

26:27.146 --> 26:29.305
That's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

26:29.306 --> 26:30.945
Tch!

26:30.946 --> 26:33.146
Going to go up and brush your teeth,
love?

26:44.546 --> 26:46.065
You look very smart.

26:46.066 --> 26:48.185
Yeah, well, I've got
a return-to-work interview

26:48.186 --> 26:50.666
and the District Commander's
popping in to see me, so...

26:53.706 --> 26:56.825
'Preparations are under way
at St William's High School

26:56.826 --> 27:00.305
'where staff and pupils are
competing in a choir competition.

27:00.306 --> 27:02.265
'Ten schools in the local area

27:02.266 --> 27:05.866
'are competing for the coveted title
of Regional Choir of the Year...'

27:13.706 --> 27:15.905
'..so make sure you tune in
for that.

27:15.906 --> 27:17.346
'Now for your weather.'

27:22.186 --> 27:23.665
How are you?

27:23.666 --> 27:25.345
Very well, sir, thank you.

27:25.346 --> 27:26.626
Good! Sit down.

27:30.826 --> 27:32.545
Why haven't you caught
Tommy Lee Royce

27:32.546 --> 27:33.905
and that other little scrote?

27:33.906 --> 27:36.425
We're doing everything we can,
Catherine. You know that.

27:36.426 --> 27:40.345
Is Lynn Dewhurst being followed?
Who? Tommy Lee Royce's mother.

27:40.346 --> 27:43.425
Well, yes, as far as I understand,
everything is being done.

27:43.426 --> 27:44.866
I will ask about that.

27:46.346 --> 27:47.945
I'll look into it personally.

27:47.946 --> 27:49.945
Has anyone tried to identify
who his father is?

27:49.946 --> 27:52.425
He could be holed up with him.
Yes. That's... I'm sure...

27:52.426 --> 27:54.025
Well, actually, no, sir,

27:54.026 --> 27:56.305
I don't think anybody does know
who his father is.

27:56.306 --> 27:58.785
Have we interviewed his old
cellmate from Wakefield,

27:58.786 --> 28:01.745
in case he's talked about family
and friends we're not aware of?

28:01.746 --> 28:04.465
I will raise that, very happy to.
I can't imagine it has...

28:04.466 --> 28:06.985
Have any senior officers attended
the PACT meeting

28:06.986 --> 28:08.465
and asked the community for help?

28:08.466 --> 28:11.345
Yes. That's definitely happened,
I've done that myself.

28:11.346 --> 28:14.825
Have we collected CCTV from all
the Chinese takeaways in the valley?

28:14.826 --> 28:16.665
Sorry, Catherine,
why would we do that?

28:16.666 --> 28:18.265
Well, we know Tommy Lee Royce

28:18.266 --> 28:21.065
liked the Chinese takeaway
on Milton Avenue, so...

28:21.066 --> 28:22.865
That's... that's too random,
Catherine.

28:22.866 --> 28:24.305
Is it?

28:24.306 --> 28:26.865
I think it'd be good detective work,
meself, personally.

28:26.866 --> 28:28.626
Are you not writing that one down,
sir?

28:30.506 --> 28:32.065
I'll raise it.

28:32.066 --> 28:33.266
Anyway...

28:34.506 --> 28:35.906
..welcome back, Catherine!

28:47.266 --> 28:50.346
Catherine, I think you should
come and listen to this.

28:53.186 --> 28:55.025
Morning.

28:55.026 --> 28:57.185
I've been delivering post
all this week

28:57.186 --> 28:59.025
to them big tower blocks on here,

28:59.026 --> 29:01.945
and there's one flat on t'fourth
floor, flat number 20...

29:01.946 --> 29:05.025
There's a smell when you open
t'letter box.

29:05.026 --> 29:06.545
It... it's not good.

29:06.546 --> 29:08.265
And there's all flies, like.

29:08.266 --> 29:11.226
So, I'm wondering
if there's a dead dog in there.

29:15.386 --> 29:17.826
Oh!

29:19.906 --> 29:22.145
There's definitely
something in there

29:22.146 --> 29:24.305
shuffled off its mortal coil, Sarge.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.585
Can you get in?
We've knocked on a few doors.

29:26.586 --> 29:28.785
The lad that lives here is called
Brett McKendrick,

29:28.786 --> 29:30.545
but nobody seems to know
much about him.

29:30.546 --> 29:32.385
We need a key. What about any family?

29:32.386 --> 29:34.345
What about a girlfriend
or his mother?

29:34.346 --> 29:36.186
Have you not got anything on t'box?

29:37.346 --> 29:39.265
Did house-to-house there
four weeks ago...

29:39.266 --> 29:41.225
Nobody's seen him lately, either.

29:41.226 --> 29:44.745
Oh, yeah, nobody's seen him
around here lately, either.

29:44.746 --> 29:47.066
OK. Have you got an Ovenden
door key in your car?

29:51.466 --> 29:52.506
Jesus.

30:09.786 --> 30:11.746
'Talk to me, Twiggy.'

30:24.386 --> 30:27.385
Ryan. Hello.

30:27.386 --> 30:29.545
D'you remember me?

30:29.546 --> 30:31.506
I'm... I'm your dad.

30:34.866 --> 30:37.185
D'you remember? Yeah...?

30:37.186 --> 30:40.625
You've probably heard
loads of bad stuff about me.

30:40.626 --> 30:43.785
But, er... not all of it's true.

30:43.786 --> 30:46.226
Me granny said you were
off your head on drugs.

30:47.786 --> 30:49.386
I'm not off my head on drugs.

30:52.506 --> 30:55.066
I am your dad, Ryan.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.146
Only, er...

31:02.026 --> 31:03.426
Only she don't like me.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.705
That's why she doesn't want me
to have anything to do with you.

31:07.706 --> 31:09.066
What's your name?

31:17.986 --> 31:20.185
Er... you can call me Dad.

31:20.186 --> 31:21.786
I mean your real name.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.506
OK. Well...

31:28.786 --> 31:29.906
..it's Tommy.

31:31.866 --> 31:33.346
I've never had a dad.

31:35.826 --> 31:37.226
I'm your dad.

31:38.226 --> 31:41.145
I am your dad.
I've been watching you for weeks.

31:41.146 --> 31:43.305
When you leave school.

31:43.306 --> 31:46.065
I wanted to say hello,
but there were never a good time.

31:46.066 --> 31:47.825
There's always someone wi' you.

31:47.826 --> 31:49.546
Not today, there isn't.

31:53.426 --> 31:55.746
How's things? Not so bad.

31:56.786 --> 31:58.026
How long have you got?

31:59.106 --> 32:01.185
I'm not supposed to talk to
strangers.

32:01.186 --> 32:04.665
No, no. But I'm not...
I'm not a stranger, I'm your dad.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.665
And the thing is...

32:06.666 --> 32:09.585
Well, I just wanted you to know
who I am.

32:09.586 --> 32:12.505
So if people tell you
bad stuff about me,

32:12.506 --> 32:14.225
well, you'll know
it ain't always true.

32:14.226 --> 32:15.546
What bad stuff?

32:17.546 --> 32:19.865
I, er... I just...

32:19.866 --> 32:22.265
Er, I made some mistakes, that's all.

32:22.266 --> 32:24.946
I got into this thing.
I didn't start it, but...

32:26.586 --> 32:28.666
..but, er, I'm the one
who's in t'most bother.

32:29.666 --> 32:32.385
That happens to me. Does it?

32:32.386 --> 32:35.705
Today, Max Higgins pulls
all the paper towels

32:35.706 --> 32:37.785
out of the machine in the toilets,

32:37.786 --> 32:41.025
and when Miss Mukherjee comes
and goes, "It was Ryan Cawood!"

32:41.026 --> 32:42.866
I'm the one who gets done.

32:43.906 --> 32:45.385
Yeah.

32:45.386 --> 32:46.466
Yeah, exactly.

32:47.586 --> 32:49.066
Exactly!

32:50.626 --> 32:51.826
Where you living?

32:55.826 --> 32:57.786
Can we go for a ride?

32:58.946 --> 33:02.065
We could. Only I'm a bit low
on petrol at the minute.

33:02.066 --> 33:05.425
How long have you lived here?

33:05.426 --> 33:08.145
It's not mine. I just... borrow it.

33:08.146 --> 33:09.545
Can I have a cigarette?

33:09.546 --> 33:11.865
No. Why?

33:11.866 --> 33:13.386
It's bad for you. You do.

33:16.626 --> 33:17.826
One drag.

33:21.266 --> 33:24.345
Me granny says you shouldn't smoke,
but she does.

33:24.346 --> 33:25.466
I've seen her.

33:34.786 --> 33:36.465
Tell me about your mum.

33:36.466 --> 33:39.985
We go see her sometimes
up in Heptonstall.

33:39.986 --> 33:41.386
How d'you mean?

33:42.426 --> 33:43.786
That's where she's buried.

33:45.026 --> 33:48.065
When did she die?
When I was born.

33:48.066 --> 33:50.065
How did she die? I don't know.

33:50.066 --> 33:53.266
But I've got me granny
and me Auntie Clare, so...

33:54.746 --> 33:56.065
Where were you?

33:56.066 --> 33:58.626
Oh, er, I was away.

34:00.866 --> 34:02.825
But nobody thought to tell me.

34:02.826 --> 34:03.906
That she'd died.

34:05.466 --> 34:08.505
But I, er, did love her, your mum.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.505
If anyone ever
tries to tell you different...

34:11.946 --> 34:14.225
I was thinking. Yeah?

34:14.226 --> 34:15.745
Maybe we should tell my granny

34:15.746 --> 34:18.386
that you're not off your head
on drugs and that you are my dad.

34:20.386 --> 34:21.425
That's, er...

34:21.426 --> 34:24.625
Thing is, you-you know I said
I'm in trouble?

34:24.626 --> 34:26.745
And it's not my fault,
I didn't start it?

34:26.746 --> 34:27.985
Yeah.

34:27.985 --> 34:30.824
Well she's a police officer,
isn't she?

34:30.826 --> 34:33.864
And, if they know where I am,
they'll come and get me

34:33.866 --> 34:34.985
and put me in prison.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.905
Why?

34:36.906 --> 34:39.425
Well, I told you I done stuff.

34:39.426 --> 34:42.465
So you can't tell her anything.
But if it wasn't your fault...

34:42.466 --> 34:44.145
They'd never believe me.

34:44.146 --> 34:45.465
Never.

34:45.466 --> 34:47.706
They... They never do.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.985
So promise me you won't say owt,
even to her.

34:53.985 --> 34:55.666
Especially to her.

34:57.746 --> 34:58.866
I do promise.

35:00.626 --> 35:04.345
If you did get some petrol,
could we go for a ride?

35:04.346 --> 35:06.105
Er...

35:06.106 --> 35:07.185
That's, er...

35:07.186 --> 35:08.506
Just you and me?

35:12.426 --> 35:14.706
Yeah, we'll see. Maybe.

35:18.146 --> 35:19.345
You better be getting on.

35:19.346 --> 35:22.026
Before they start wondering
where you are.

35:24.146 --> 35:25.745
Can I come again tomorrow?

35:25.746 --> 35:27.546
Will you bring me some milk?

35:28.546 --> 35:30.385
See ya.

35:30.386 --> 35:32.745
You look after yersen. Yeah.

35:32.746 --> 35:35.066
And you mustn't say anything.
To anyone.

36:02.826 --> 36:04.985
This morning,
just before half past nine,

36:04.986 --> 36:08.306
we found two bodies
in a flat in Sowerby Bridge.

36:10.226 --> 36:12.505
One of them was Lewis Whippey.

36:12.506 --> 36:15.825
The other was a lad
called Brett McKendrick.

36:15.826 --> 36:19.106
The pathologist thinks they'd been
there between three and four weeks.

36:21.906 --> 36:24.505
There was a lot of blood,
not surprisingly, in the kitchen,

36:24.506 --> 36:27.505
which the senior investigating
officer from the murder team

36:27.506 --> 36:28.905
fast-tracked down the lab,

36:28.906 --> 36:31.745
and it turns out this blood
isn't Lewis Whippey's

36:31.746 --> 36:33.826
or Brett McKendrick's. It's, um...

36:36.626 --> 36:37.986
It's Tommy Lee Royce's.

36:39.706 --> 36:40.786
So...

36:42.106 --> 36:44.026
..that's where they were hiding.

36:47.826 --> 36:50.145
The flat was covered
in the house-to-house, but...

36:50.146 --> 36:52.505
He can't have got far.
It's unlikely.

36:52.506 --> 36:54.505
And he must have sustained
a serious injury.

36:54.506 --> 36:57.786
We're talking between
two and three pints of blood, so...

36:59.226 --> 37:01.665
Injury, septicaemia.

37:01.666 --> 37:02.825
Could he be dead?

37:02.826 --> 37:05.545
Yeah, it's a possibility.

37:05.546 --> 37:06.985
You know they questioned me

37:06.986 --> 37:09.585
over that bastard that got shot,
Ashley Cowgill?

37:09.586 --> 37:11.026
Have they caught anyone?

37:12.906 --> 37:14.706
I doubt they ever will. Er...

37:15.786 --> 37:18.946
Ashley Cowgill was a drugs dealer.
He was part of, um...

37:20.626 --> 37:22.705
You've got to understand
how these people work.

37:22.706 --> 37:24.305
They're organised, seriously.

37:24.306 --> 37:27.785
The reason he was let out on bail
was because, apparently,

37:27.786 --> 37:30.425
he gave information to the police.
This was a big deal for him.

37:30.426 --> 37:34.505
His family were going to have to go into
hiding once the arrests were made, but...

37:34.506 --> 37:36.705
It looks like someone, somewhere,

37:36.706 --> 37:39.146
told people higher up the chain
what he'd done, so...

37:40.546 --> 37:42.026
They're untouchable.

37:43.506 --> 37:46.545
Every day, we have to deal with kids
off their heads

37:46.546 --> 37:49.305
on whatever rubbish they can find
to inject themselves with.

37:49.306 --> 37:50.706
And it never stops.

37:55.306 --> 37:56.466
It just never stops.

38:00.586 --> 38:04.345
'One of the two bodies found
today in a flat in West Yorkshire

38:04.346 --> 38:07.065
'has been confirmed
as that of Lewis Whippey,

38:07.066 --> 38:10.305
'one of the men wanted in connection
with the murder two months ago

38:10.306 --> 38:13.305
'of PC Kirsten McAskill.

38:13.306 --> 38:15.825
'It's also now known
that Tommy Lee Royce -

38:15.826 --> 38:19.825
'also wanted in connection with the
murder of the 24-year-old police officer -

38:19.826 --> 38:22.186
'had been at the same flat
in Sowerby Bridge.'

38:24.266 --> 38:27.145
'Detectives believe Tommy Lee Royce
is still in the area

38:27.146 --> 38:30.025
'and have asked members of the
public to be extra vigilant.

38:30.026 --> 38:34.906
'They've also reiterated that
he may be armed, and is dangerous.'

39:02.466 --> 39:05.226
Thank you for coming.
Oh, it's a pleasure!

39:06.906 --> 39:11.065
Jenny said the reason you're
illegally withholding my wages

39:11.066 --> 39:14.825
is I have to understand that
my actions have consequences

39:14.826 --> 39:16.226
for people other than myself.

39:18.626 --> 39:21.785
You think it's my fault
your daughter was raped...

39:21.786 --> 39:23.106
and humiliated.

39:26.306 --> 39:27.585
I asked you for a rise

39:27.586 --> 39:30.305
so I could send one of my daughters
to a better school.

39:30.306 --> 39:35.465
Considering how comprehensively
you ripped my father off,

39:35.466 --> 39:38.146
I would've thought
that wasn't too much to ask.

39:41.346 --> 39:42.785
It would have never occurred to me

39:42.786 --> 39:46.226
to suggest kidnapping your daughter
to those animals...

39:47.506 --> 39:49.466
..if you'd just said yes...

39:50.826 --> 39:52.665
..when I asked.

39:52.666 --> 39:53.746
So...

39:54.986 --> 39:56.586
..you're right, Nevison.

39:58.266 --> 40:02.226
Your actions have had consequences
for people other than yourself.

40:07.386 --> 40:08.426
You bastard.

40:10.986 --> 40:12.186
You can go now.

40:22.226 --> 40:23.346
It's this one.

40:26.346 --> 40:28.946
Dad! Dad! It's me.

40:34.386 --> 40:35.425
Who's that?

40:35.426 --> 40:37.945
Cesco. He's me friend.

40:37.946 --> 40:40.226
He didn't believe me
when I told him I had a dad.

40:41.426 --> 40:44.146
Can we come in?
I brought you some milk.

40:55.546 --> 40:57.865
So how fast does it go?

40:57.866 --> 40:59.025
It don't. Yet.

40:59.026 --> 41:00.665
But it will.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.665
We're going to get some petrol,
aren't we, Dad?

41:02.666 --> 41:05.505
Can I see the steering wheel?
There isn't one.

41:05.506 --> 41:06.945
Well, how d'you steer it, then?

41:06.946 --> 41:08.985
There's a pole. Can I show him?

41:08.986 --> 41:10.066
No, not just now.

41:11.266 --> 41:12.625
Why don't you light t'fire?

41:12.626 --> 41:14.185
It's not cold enough.

41:14.186 --> 41:15.785
It's freezing!

41:15.786 --> 41:17.946
You could come with us.
Couldn't he, Dad?

41:19.626 --> 41:23.505
You could've, but it's just
going to be me and my dad.

41:23.506 --> 41:26.426
Ain't it? When we get some petrol?

41:27.906 --> 41:28.946
Yeah.

41:30.226 --> 41:31.666
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

41:36.506 --> 41:38.225
They're going to eat me alive!

41:38.226 --> 41:39.625
'So what's the basic problem?'

41:39.626 --> 41:42.066
The basic problem is that
he's distressing the toddlers.

41:44.026 --> 41:45.865
Sounds to me like
they're distressing him.

41:45.866 --> 41:48.625
Jamie! Jamie, lad, listen to me.

41:48.626 --> 41:51.185
There's no crocodiles
in this country,

41:51.186 --> 41:52.705
we don't have crocodiles here!

41:52.706 --> 41:55.825
That's... It's...
It's Australia, it's down under.

41:55.826 --> 41:58.145
They're evil! Dislocating
their slimy bastard jaws

41:58.146 --> 41:59.665
just so they can swallow you!

41:59.666 --> 42:03.065
'What's that film wi' that
tick-tock, tick-tock crocodile...?

42:03.066 --> 42:04.385
'Who?'

42:04.386 --> 42:05.425
Peter Pan.

42:05.426 --> 42:06.465
'Yeah, whatever,'

42:06.466 --> 42:07.905
I think he's been watching that

42:07.906 --> 42:09.426
and smoking skunk
at the same time.

42:11.066 --> 42:14.385
No! Don't you step in there!
They'll have you!

42:14.386 --> 42:17.505
Can you keep her with you, please,
love?

42:17.506 --> 42:19.305
Some of them are even thinking!

42:19.306 --> 42:20.585
Shaf?

42:20.586 --> 42:23.105
Shaf, is anyone's life
actually in danger?

42:23.106 --> 42:26.306
'No. Tarzan might graze his knee
if he falls off his swing...'

42:43.826 --> 42:46.065
Did Mr Badal do all those things
he said he'd do?

42:46.066 --> 42:48.065
All those things
he wrote on that Post-it note?

42:48.066 --> 42:49.825
Well, yes,
I imagine he would've done.

42:49.826 --> 42:51.425
You imagine? Have you asked him?

42:51.426 --> 42:53.705
Catherine, I can't check up
on the District...

42:53.706 --> 42:55.865
He didn't just toss it in the bin
as I left the room?

42:55.866 --> 42:57.505
No, he didn't.

42:57.506 --> 42:58.705
He put it in his pocket

42:58.706 --> 43:01.065
and I had the impression
he was going to follow it all up.

43:01.066 --> 43:02.905
Yeah, but you would say that,
wouldn't you?

43:02.906 --> 43:05.105
Cos you all piss in the same pot
as each other.

43:05.106 --> 43:07.745
I'm sorry? Like that nonsense
with Marcus Gascoigne.

43:07.746 --> 43:11.145
Shall we have this conversation
in my office, Sergeant?

43:11.146 --> 43:12.945
Have they checked
if any of the hospitals

43:12.946 --> 43:14.865
have reported any gunshot
or stab wounds?

43:14.866 --> 43:16.385
Get into my office. Have they?

43:16.386 --> 43:18.145
What about Roger Elgood? Who?

43:18.146 --> 43:20.105
Roger Elgood.
He was a GP, lives on Ripponden.

43:20.106 --> 43:22.705
Got struck off months since
for signing blank prescriptions.

43:22.706 --> 43:24.465
Don't you know what goes on
on your patch?

43:24.466 --> 43:26.545
Why would Royce know
to go to Roger Elgood?

43:26.546 --> 43:27.945
Why wouldn't he? Catherine.

43:27.946 --> 43:30.385
I'm wondering, do you think
you've come back too soon?

43:30.386 --> 43:32.785
Yeah, probably.
But what alternative have I got?

43:32.786 --> 43:34.505
Who else is even looking
for this bloke?

43:34.506 --> 43:36.905
Catherine, if this was anyone
else... I'm going home.

43:36.906 --> 43:39.225
No! I need to talk to you
in my office!

43:39.226 --> 43:41.265
I'm fed up of working
with trained monkeys.

43:41.266 --> 43:42.905
You're not going to get away
with that.

43:42.906 --> 43:44.665
I know you've not been well...
Piss off!

43:44.666 --> 43:48.185
I'll have your stripes, lady, if you don't
button it. Please go into my office!

43:48.186 --> 43:49.346
You can have 'em.

43:52.106 --> 43:54.705
You can shove 'em your arse.
There you go.

43:54.706 --> 43:55.985
Pick 'em up.

43:55.986 --> 43:57.945
You're in trouble, Catherine.

43:57.946 --> 43:59.786
Yeah, whatever. Bye.

44:07.386 --> 44:09.665
Have you not brought
your little friend wi' you today?

44:09.666 --> 44:10.905
Nah, he didn't want to come.

44:10.906 --> 44:13.545
He didn't think
you were very nice to him.

44:13.546 --> 44:15.146
Oh? Neither did I.

44:27.466 --> 44:28.945
Was I not?

44:28.946 --> 44:30.425
What's up?

44:30.426 --> 44:32.385
I thought I said not to tell anyone.

44:32.386 --> 44:34.145
I thought you meant grown-ups.

44:34.146 --> 44:36.345
No, I meant anyone.

44:36.346 --> 44:37.586
Sorry.

44:40.146 --> 44:41.586
S'all right.

44:43.786 --> 44:46.305
D'you want to go through there?
I've got summat for you.

44:46.306 --> 44:48.546
What? It's a surprise.

44:50.586 --> 44:53.386
Go on! There's nowt
to be frightened of.

44:55.386 --> 44:57.945
You're not frightened of me,
are you?

44:57.946 --> 44:59.066
No.

45:07.586 --> 45:08.786
Sit yersen down.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.385
Hello?

45:36.386 --> 45:38.345
It's me. Where the hell
are you?

45:38.346 --> 45:41.305
Why? I rang the nick.
Nobody'd tell me where you were.

45:41.306 --> 45:42.545
What's up?

45:42.546 --> 45:45.385
I told our Ryan to be in by five,
and he wasn't.

45:45.386 --> 45:48.705
And when it got to 20 past, I rang
to see if he was round at Cesco's,

45:48.706 --> 45:50.305
and guess what Cesco's mum told me?

45:50.306 --> 45:52.385
That Cesco had told her...

45:52.386 --> 45:54.665
that our Ryan had been visiting
his dad

45:54.666 --> 45:56.746
'on his boat down at the canal.

45:58.026 --> 46:00.866
'Where are you?' H-h-how does...?

46:01.986 --> 46:04.585
How does Cesco know that?
He went with him yesterday.

46:04.586 --> 46:08.065
All right. All right, I'm coming.
I'm, um...

46:08.066 --> 46:09.745
Right, ring Cesco back.

46:09.746 --> 46:12.385
And ask him carefully...
I ain't got their number on me.

46:12.386 --> 46:15.345
Ask him carefully where exactly
this boat is, what it's called,

46:15.346 --> 46:18.785
what colour it is,
anything that can identify it.

46:18.786 --> 46:20.105
Shaf! Thank God.

46:20.106 --> 46:22.985
I've rung the Inspector's office,
but nobody's answering, as per.

46:22.986 --> 46:24.225
Listen to me very carefully.

46:24.226 --> 46:26.865
You know you're in, like,
37 different types of trouble? Yeah,

46:26.866 --> 46:28.105
just listen. I think...

46:28.106 --> 46:30.185
I THINK Tommy Lee Royce
is on a narrow boat

46:30.186 --> 46:31.825
down on the canal at Hebden Bridge.

46:31.826 --> 46:33.465
I want you to inform Force Comms -

46:33.466 --> 46:35.945
we need an helicopter up,
we need firearms, we need OSU,

46:35.946 --> 46:38.665
we need a dog.
Catherine, are you sure?

46:38.666 --> 46:41.225
Go and knock on the DCI's door!
Now! Right now!

46:41.226 --> 46:43.625
I know you're frightened of him,
but now is not the time.

46:43.626 --> 46:46.025
Tell him what's going on.
I need people there... fast.

46:46.026 --> 46:47.305
And...

46:47.306 --> 46:49.505
'What?'

46:49.506 --> 46:51.665
I think he's got our Ryan with him.

46:51.666 --> 46:53.066
'I'm on it.'

46:57.026 --> 46:59.825
'Sergeant Cawood,
do you have a rendezvous point?'

46:59.826 --> 47:01.185
Not yet.

47:01.186 --> 47:03.145
'Are you available
to keep obs on the boat?'

47:03.146 --> 47:04.346
I will be.

47:05.466 --> 47:07.425
'Please await arrival of
reinforcements

47:07.426 --> 47:09.305
'before making any sort of
approach.'

47:09.306 --> 47:10.946
Yeah, whatever.

47:16.146 --> 47:17.665
I do have to go now.

47:17.666 --> 47:19.826
Dad. Call me Dad again.

47:21.146 --> 47:23.065
I do have to go now, Dad.

47:23.066 --> 47:25.265
I liked it when you called me Dad
yesterday.

47:25.266 --> 47:28.345
But I were a bit surprised,
I have to be honest wi' you,

47:28.346 --> 47:30.865
when you turned up wi'
your little buddy.

47:30.866 --> 47:33.546
I only brought him
cos he didn't believe me.

47:37.706 --> 47:39.745
I should have been home by now.

47:39.746 --> 47:42.025
I did say not to tell anyone.

47:42.026 --> 47:44.585
It'll be reight.

47:44.586 --> 47:46.385
You think?

47:46.386 --> 47:48.225
Yeah.

47:48.226 --> 47:51.185
I think...

47:51.186 --> 47:55.065
..you might have sold me
down t'river, Ryan, lad.

47:55.066 --> 47:56.706
What does that mean?

48:00.146 --> 48:01.266
I think...

48:02.666 --> 48:05.786
..the time has come
when I have to...

48:07.826 --> 48:09.506
Yep.

48:10.506 --> 48:11.665
..move on.

48:11.666 --> 48:13.465
Not because I told him?

48:13.466 --> 48:16.105
Yeah. Exactly because of that.

48:16.106 --> 48:18.026
I won't tell no-one else.

48:23.146 --> 48:24.626
D'you want another?

48:25.626 --> 48:28.146
I've not drank this one yet.

48:38.226 --> 48:40.425
I found some petrol.

48:40.426 --> 48:42.585
I thought what might be nice...

48:42.586 --> 48:45.185
is if I took you with me.

48:45.186 --> 48:47.425
Like you wanted.

48:47.426 --> 48:51.666
Cos I... I really don't want
to leave you here with your granny.

48:58.866 --> 49:01.505
Wait! He said wait. Be careful!

49:01.506 --> 49:03.505
Oh, shit.

49:03.506 --> 49:05.905
Shit! Ah, shit!

49:05.906 --> 49:08.225
Catherine! Catherine, listen to me.

49:08.226 --> 49:12.025
You can't just wade in there.
You don't know what he might have.

49:12.026 --> 49:14.145
He might have a knife.
He might have... anything!

49:14.146 --> 49:16.785
And, if Ryan's... Ryan's
been coming here for days,

49:16.786 --> 49:19.225
he's been coming home
safely for days as well.

49:19.226 --> 49:21.985
He's his SON!
Get off me!

49:21.986 --> 49:23.905
Will you...?! Argh!

49:23.906 --> 49:25.225
Will you listen to me?!

49:25.226 --> 49:27.825
He's been coming home
at five o'clock every day this week,

49:27.826 --> 49:29.585
like I asked him to.

49:29.586 --> 49:32.505
Let's find which boat it is and
wait for your lot to turn up.

49:32.506 --> 49:35.025
Cos chances are he's just
going to walk off the boat

49:35.026 --> 49:37.145
and he's going to be fine.

49:37.146 --> 49:38.226
Yeah?

49:39.586 --> 49:41.825
Why weren't you at work?

49:41.826 --> 49:44.345
Cos I've resigned.
What you talking about?

49:44.346 --> 49:45.386
I just said.

49:46.786 --> 49:48.626
Where were you?

49:50.306 --> 49:51.546
Nowhere.

49:55.786 --> 49:58.466
What's happened?
I've had enough, that's all.

50:06.626 --> 50:09.586
We're going to wait.
We're going to wait, aren't we?

50:14.466 --> 50:17.585
If I am coming with you,
I'd better tell me granny,

50:17.586 --> 50:20.545
otherwise she'll be worrying
about where I am.

50:20.546 --> 50:22.465
Nah, I doubt it.

50:22.466 --> 50:24.025
No, she will.

50:24.026 --> 50:26.025
She doesn't love you, you know.

50:26.026 --> 50:28.585
She thinks you're
a friggin' nuisance.

50:28.586 --> 50:30.026
No, she doesn't.

50:35.226 --> 50:37.425
There are a couple of things...

50:37.426 --> 50:39.226
I haven't told you, Ryan.

50:41.586 --> 50:45.066
This... journey we're going on,
it's...

50:46.906 --> 50:49.185
It might not be what
you were expecting.

50:49.186 --> 50:52.505
It's a... different
sort of kind of journey.

50:52.506 --> 50:54.625
I don't want to go any more.

50:54.626 --> 50:55.706
No...

50:59.666 --> 51:00.706
I think...

51:01.946 --> 51:04.985
I think it would be good
to take you with me.

51:04.986 --> 51:08.866
I think we're always going to be
misfits, you and me.

51:10.146 --> 51:13.265
And I don't want you
to have to go through

51:13.266 --> 51:15.066
all the shit I've been through.

51:17.106 --> 51:18.266
And you will.

51:46.306 --> 51:48.425
Help!

51:48.426 --> 51:50.505
Granny!

51:50.506 --> 51:52.146
Just... Oh.

51:56.106 --> 51:58.865
Just let him go.
Yeah, yeah, that's happening!

51:58.866 --> 52:01.145
It's me you want, not him.

52:01.146 --> 52:03.065
I couldn't give a toss about you.

52:03.066 --> 52:05.626
In fact, I'll tell you
what I would like.

52:06.786 --> 52:10.265
Is for you to live a long,
long time, in agony.

52:10.266 --> 52:13.665
So I'll tell you what I'd like you
to remember, bitch.

52:13.666 --> 52:16.785
Is that you've brought
all this on yourself.

52:16.786 --> 52:20.865
It's all your fault.
All of it, everything.

52:20.866 --> 52:24.586
Oh, and, er, you didn't find me.

52:26.346 --> 52:28.106
I found you.

52:30.346 --> 52:31.705
Ugh! Get out!

52:31.706 --> 52:34.145
What about you? Out! Now!

52:34.146 --> 52:35.426
Urgh!

52:46.946 --> 52:48.186
Guess what.

52:49.226 --> 52:51.825
You're going to have to get someone
to wipe your arse for you.

52:51.826 --> 52:53.505
Kill me! Yeah?

52:53.506 --> 52:55.266
Give me the lighter!

52:57.146 --> 52:58.785
Why would I want to do that?

52:58.786 --> 53:00.146
Kill me!

53:06.626 --> 53:07.866
Kill me.

53:14.266 --> 53:15.426
No.

53:16.666 --> 53:17.746
Kill me!

53:19.306 --> 53:20.625
Argh!

53:20.626 --> 53:23.466
Bitch! Bitch!

53:24.506 --> 53:27.225
Fucking bitch!

53:27.226 --> 53:29.626
Bitch! Fuckin'...!

53:31.346 --> 53:32.786
Sarge!

53:59.906 --> 54:01.466
Catherine.

54:06.666 --> 54:09.585
Inspector Taylor'd like you to take
another three weeks off work

54:09.586 --> 54:12.385
and if he sees you inside
Norland Road nick during that time,

54:12.386 --> 54:14.146
he'll kick your arse
down the stairs.

54:20.346 --> 54:21.666
Right.

54:38.906 --> 54:39.986
You got him.

54:42.266 --> 54:43.386
Yep.

55:14.706 --> 55:15.866
Thanks for ringing.

55:17.906 --> 55:20.386
D'you want some, um...?
Sure.

55:26.786 --> 55:27.906
Thanks for coming.

55:29.946 --> 55:31.146
I'm sorry...

55:32.426 --> 55:34.185
..that I spoilt your birthday.

55:34.186 --> 55:35.906
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I, um...

55:40.786 --> 55:43.345
When your baby's born, you'll know.

55:43.346 --> 55:44.506
You'll get it.

55:46.226 --> 55:47.746
Losing a child, it's just, it's...

55:53.586 --> 55:57.265
The only way you can cope with it,
I suspect, is to go a little bit mad.

55:57.266 --> 55:59.545
And it's never fair
on other children,

55:59.546 --> 56:00.905
your other children,

56:00.906 --> 56:02.105
to see a parent like that

56:02.106 --> 56:04.345
and to have to put up
with the things that are said.

56:04.346 --> 56:06.745
And I'm sorry that happened to you.

56:06.746 --> 56:08.146
I'm sorry I let it.

56:10.746 --> 56:12.306
I know she wasn't perfect.

56:13.386 --> 56:14.906
I do know that.

56:20.586 --> 56:22.906
I wish I could show you
how much I love you.

56:24.346 --> 56:25.386
Mum...

56:26.586 --> 56:28.266
I'm so proud of you.

56:31.666 --> 56:34.505
What about you and Dad... and Ros?

56:34.506 --> 56:35.626
Oh, that's...

56:37.706 --> 56:39.065
You see that...

56:39.066 --> 56:42.146
Me and your dad probably
would never have split up if...

56:44.306 --> 56:46.586
But we did. So...

56:48.946 --> 56:51.705
And Ryan, every day, I don't know,
he'll do something,

56:51.706 --> 56:53.785
he'll be in trouble,
he'll drive me up the wall

56:53.786 --> 56:55.785
and I don't know
that I made the right decision,

56:55.786 --> 56:58.345
but I genuinely don't know
what else I could've done.

56:58.346 --> 56:59.625
I know. I know.

56:59.626 --> 57:01.905
Had him put in care? No.

57:01.906 --> 57:03.665
Even though you all hated me for it.

57:03.666 --> 57:04.906
Mum...

57:06.346 --> 57:07.506
..nobody hates you.
