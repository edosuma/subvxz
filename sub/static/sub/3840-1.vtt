03:58.989 --> 04:00.707
<i>So you were raised in a zoo?</i>

04:00.866 --> 04:02.083
<i>Born and raised.</i>

04:02.242 --> 04:05.712
<i>In Pondicherry, in what was
the French part of India.</i>

04:05.871 --> 04:07.748
<i>My father owned the zoo...</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:11.214
<i>and I was delivered on short
notice by a herpetologist...</i>

04:11.376 --> 04:14.880
<i>who was there to check
on the Bengal monitor lizard.</i>

04:15.464 --> 04:17.432
<i>Mother and I
were both healthy...</i>

04:17.591 --> 04:19.218
<i>but the poor lizard escaped...</i>

04:19.384 --> 04:22.433
<i>and was trampled
by a frightened cassowary.</i>

04:24.681 --> 04:26.900
The way of karma, huh?

04:27.392 --> 04:29.440
The way of God.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.151
That's quite a story.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.028
I had assumed your father was a

04:34.149 --> 04:35.526
mathematician
because of your name.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.787
Far from it, I was named
after a swimming pool.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.786
There is a swimming pool named "Pi"?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.202
You see,
my uncle Francis was born

04:45.327 --> 04:47.455
with too much
water in his lungs.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.882
They say the doctors
swung Francis around

04:49.998 --> 04:52.092
by the ankles to
clear the water out...

04:52.250 --> 04:54.924
and that's what gave him the
huge chest and skinny legs...

04:55.086 --> 04:57.384
that made him
such a great swimmer.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.016
Is Francis actually your uncle?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.885
He said he was
friends with your father.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.056
He's my honorary uncle,
I call him Mamaji.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.975
My father's best friend,
my swimming guru.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.733
<i>I trained with him three
times a week at the ashram.</i>

05:11.895 --> 05:14.944
<i>His lessons would save my
life in the end.</i>

05:15.607 --> 05:20.113
A mouthful of water will not
harm you, but panic will.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.620
Remember to breathe now,
don't hold your breath.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.459
Good boy.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.631
I hope you don't
mind vegetarian.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.134
No, no. Not at all.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.260
And your name?
Huh?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.423
You were going to tell me how
you got your name, I think.

05:39.589 --> 05:43.594
Oh, yes. I got it from something
Mamaji once told my father.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.478
You see, most travelers collect

05:45.554 --> 05:47.181
postcards or teacups
on their journeys...

05:47.347 --> 05:48.348
but not Mamaji.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.609
Mamaji collects swimming pools.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.486
He swims in every
pool he comes upon.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.493
<i>One day, Mamaji
said to my father that,</i>

06:03.613 --> 06:05.456
<i>of all the pools
in the world...</i>

06:05.615 --> 06:08.960
<i>the most beautiful was
a public pool in Paris.</i>

06:09.119 --> 06:10.712
<i>That the water
there was so clear,</i>

06:10.787 --> 06:13.006
<i>you could make your
morning coffee with it.</i>

06:13.164 --> 06:16.509
<i>That a single swim
there changed his life.</i>

06:30.307 --> 06:32.150
<i>Before I was born, he said...</i>

06:32.309 --> 06:34.903
<i>"If you want your son
to have a clean soul...</i>

06:35.061 --> 06:39.487
<i>you must take him one day to
swim in the Piscine Molitor."</i>

06:39.649 --> 06:43.495
<i>I never understood why my father
took this so much to heart.</i>

06:44.154 --> 06:49.160
But he did, and I was named
"Piscine Molitor Patel."

06:49.993 --> 06:52.371
<i>Imagine me trying
to explain that name.</i>

06:52.537 --> 06:55.211
<i>I barely made it to
the age of 11 before...</i>

06:55.373 --> 06:57.421
Hey, Piscine!

06:58.335 --> 07:01.214
Are you pissing right now?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.385
Look at him, he's pissing!

07:03.548 --> 07:07.724
<i>With one word, my name went from
an elegant French swimming pool...</i>

07:07.886 --> 07:09.684
<i>to a stinking Indian latrine.</i>

07:09.763 --> 07:11.686
<i>I was "Pissing" everywhere.</i>

07:11.848 --> 07:14.522
No Pissing in the schoolyard!

07:15.894 --> 07:17.692
<i>Even the teachers
started doing it.</i>

07:17.854 --> 07:19.197
<i>Not deliberately, of course.</i>

07:19.356 --> 07:23.236
So, then, what might occur
if we release gas too quickly?

07:23.401 --> 07:24.527
Pissing?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.246
He said "Pissing."

07:32.702 --> 07:35.546
That's enough!
Order! Order!

07:36.039 --> 07:38.792
<i>When we returned the next
year for our first day of school,</i>

07:38.875 --> 07:40.092
<i>I was prepared.</i>

07:40.251 --> 07:41.548
Present, sir.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.139
Piscine Patel.

07:49.552 --> 07:53.056
Good morning.
I am Piscine Molitor Patel.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.233
Known to all as...

07:56.559 --> 07:59.733
Pi, the sixteenth letter
of the Greek alphabet...

07:59.896 --> 08:03.571
which is also used in mathematics
to represent the ratio...

08:03.733 --> 08:07.237
of any circle's circumference
to its diameter.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.452
An irrational number
of infinite length,

08:09.572 --> 08:11.666
usually rounded
to three digits...

08:11.825 --> 08:12.369
as 3.14.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.082
Pi.

08:20.083 --> 08:24.589
Very impressive, Pi.
Now, sit down.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.767
<i>And from then on,
you were "Pi"?</i>

08:30.343 --> 08:32.471
<i>Well, no, not quite.</i>

08:32.846 --> 08:34.688
Nice try, Pissing.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.686
<i>But I still had the whole
day ahead of me.</i>

08:38.852 --> 08:40.445
<i>French class was next.</i>

08:40.729 --> 08:42.777
<i>Je m'appelle</i>
Piscine Molitor Patel.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.616
<i>Dit Pi.</i>

08:46.818 --> 08:48.320
<i>Then, geography.</i>

08:48.486 --> 08:52.116
These are the first
20 decimal places of pi.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.286
<i>My last class of the
day was mathematics.</i>

08:55.827 --> 08:59.877
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

09:04.377 --> 09:11.306
Three.
Seven. Five. Eight. Nine.

09:11.468 --> 09:16.144
Eight. Five. Eight. Nine.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.150
It's right.
He's really doing this.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.734
Pi! Pi! Pi!

09:22.896 --> 09:27.823
<i>By the end of that day,
I was Pi Patel, school legend.</i>

09:29.027 --> 09:32.577
Um, Mamaji tells me you're a
legend among sailors, too.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.872
Out there, all alone.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.205
Oh, I don't even know
how to sail.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.496
And I wasn't alone out there.
Richard Parker was with me.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.374
Richard Parker?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.042
Mamaji didn't tell me
everything.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.053
He just said I should look you
up when I got back to Montreal.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.055
So, what were you
doing in Pondicherry?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.346
Writing a novel.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.352
By the way,
I enjoyed your first book.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.018
So, this new one,
is it set in India?

09:57.180 --> 10:00.684
No, Portugal, actually. But
it's cheaper living in India.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.442
Ah, well, I look
forward to reading it.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.569
You can't.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.950
I threw it out.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.950
Two years trying to bring
this thing to life...

10:11.027 --> 10:14.952
and then one day, it
sputtered, coughed and died.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.618
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.957
Uh, I was sitting in this coffee
house in Pondicherry one afternoon,

10:23.039 --> 10:24.165
mourning my loss...

10:24.249 --> 10:28.095
when this old man at the table next
to me struck up a conversation.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.929
Yeah, Mamaji, he does that.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.088
When I told him about my
abandoned book, he said...

10:32.090 --> 10:34.309
"So, a
Canadian who's come to French India

10:34.384 --> 10:36.057
in search of a story."

10:36.219 --> 10:39.268
"Well, my friend, I know an
Indian in French Canada...

10:39.430 --> 10:42.229
with the most
incredible story to tell."

10:42.392 --> 10:46.568
"It must be fate that the
two of you should meet."

10:49.732 --> 10:53.111
Well, I haven't spoken about
Richard Parker in so many years.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.906
So, what has
Mamaji already told you?

10:56.072 --> 10:59.667
He said you had a story that
would make me believe in God.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.251
He would
say that about a nice meal.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.258
As for God, I can only
tell you my story.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.095
You will decide for yourself
what you believe.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.927
Fair enough.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.017
Let's see, then.
Where to begin?

11:17.010 --> 11:21.311
Pondicherry is the
French Riviera of India.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.399
<i>In the streets
closest to the ocean,</i>

11:27.478 --> 11:30.197
<i>you might think you were
in the south of France.</i>

11:32.984 --> 11:35.783
<i>A few blocks inland,
there's a canal.</i>

11:35.945 --> 11:38.289
<i>Just beyond that
is Indian Pondicherry.</i>

11:39.282 --> 11:42.832
<i>And the Muslim quarter
is just to the west.</i>

11:42.994 --> 11:46.464
When the French handed Pondicherry
back to us in 1954...

11:46.623 --> 11:50.127
the town decided that some sort
of commemoration was in order.

11:50.501 --> 11:54.131
<i>My father, who was a clever
businessman, came up with one.</i>

11:54.297 --> 11:57.722
<i>He ran a hotel, and he got
the idea to open a zoo...</i>

11:57.884 --> 12:00.683
<i>in the local
botanical gardens instead.</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:07.022
<i>As it also happened, my mother
was a botanist in the gardens.</i>

12:07.185 --> 12:11.907
<i>They met, married, and a year
later my brother Ravi was born.</i>

12:12.065 --> 12:14.238
<i>I came two years after that.</i>

12:14.984 --> 12:18.409
It sounds magical,
growing up in...

12:24.160 --> 12:25.537
Amen.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.172
Yeah, let's eat.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.171
I didn't know
Hindus said "amen."

12:30.333 --> 12:31.676
Catholic Hindus do.

12:31.834 --> 12:32.926
Catholic Hindus?

12:33.002 --> 12:37.007
We get to feel guilty before hundreds
of gods, instead of just one.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.427
But you're a Hindu first?

12:40.593 --> 12:43.563
None of us knows God
until someone introduces us.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.520
I was first introduced
to God as a Hindu.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.277
There are 33 million gods
in the Hindu religion.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.529
How can I not come to
know a few of them?

12:53.273 --> 12:56.277
<i>I met Krishna first.</i>

12:58.236 --> 13:00.238
Yashoda once accused
baby Krishna of eating dirt.

13:01.030 --> 13:05.080
"Tut, tut you naughty boy -
you shouldn't do that."

13:05.493 --> 13:08.292
But he didn't!

13:09.372 --> 13:10.840
That's what he told her.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.925
"I didn't eat dirt."

13:13.626 --> 13:16.721
Yashoda said,
"No? Well then..."

13:16.921 --> 13:19.049
"Open your mouth."

13:19.215 --> 13:21.968
So Krishna opened his mouth.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.137
And what do you think
Yashoda saw?

13:24.220 --> 13:25.437
What?

13:26.222 --> 13:33.822
She saw in Krishna's mouth
the whole entire universe.

14:01.090 --> 14:04.139
<i>The gods were my
superheroes growing up.</i>

14:04.302 --> 14:06.600
<i>Hanuman, the monkey god...</i>

14:06.763 --> 14:10.609
<i>lifting an entire mountain
to save his friend Lakshman.</i>

14:10.767 --> 14:13.111
<i>Ganesh, the elephant-headed...</i>

14:13.269 --> 14:17.524
<i>risking his life to defend the
honor of his mother, Parvati.</i>

14:17.774 --> 14:22.780
<i>Vishnu, the supreme soul,
the source of all things.</i>

14:23.363 --> 14:26.867
<i>Vishnu sleeps, floating on the
shoreless cosmic ocean...</i>

14:27.033 --> 14:29.957
<i>and we are
the stuff of his dreaming.</i>

14:31.454 --> 14:33.331
Spectacle.

14:33.790 --> 14:37.795
Don't let these stories and
pretty lights fool you, boys.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.056
<i>Religion is darkness.</i>

14:44.384 --> 14:47.854
<i>My dear appa believed
himself part of the new India.</i>

14:48.679 --> 14:50.977
<i>As a child, he had had polio.</i>

14:51.140 --> 14:55.361
<i>He used to lie in bed racked with
pain, wondering where God was.</i>

14:56.187 --> 15:00.363
<i>In the end, God didn't save
him, Western medicine did.</i>

15:03.653 --> 15:05.155
<i>My amma went to college...</i>

15:05.321 --> 15:08.165
<i>and thought her family was part
of the new India as well...</i>

15:08.324 --> 15:09.997
<i>until her parents
cut her off...</i>

15:10.159 --> 15:12.537
<i>because they thought
she was marrying beneath her.</i>

15:13.663 --> 15:17.418
<i>Her religion was the only
link she had to her past.</i>

15:27.051 --> 15:30.726
<i>I met Christ in the
mountains when I was 12.</i>

15:30.888 --> 15:34.609
<i>We were visiting relatives,
tea growers in Munnar.</i>

15:34.767 --> 15:39.022
<i>It was our third day there.
Ravi and I were terribly bored.</i>

15:39.188 --> 15:42.112
Challenge.
I'll give you two rupees.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.449
Run in to that church
and drink the holy water.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.202
You must be thirsty.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.453
Here.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.414
I brought you this.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.470
Why would a god do that?

16:51.636 --> 16:53.764
Why would
He send His own son...

16:53.930 --> 16:57.309
to suffer for the sins
of ordinary people?

16:57.475 --> 16:59.443
Because He loves us.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.814
God made Himself
approachable to us,

17:02.939 --> 17:05.613
human,
so we could understand Him.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.368
We can't understand God
in all His perfection.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.122
But we can understand God's son

17:11.280 --> 17:13.874
and His suffering
as we would a brother's.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.335
That made no sense.

17:16.493 --> 17:20.964
Sacrificing the innocent to atone
for the sins of the guilty...

17:21.123 --> 17:23.125
What kind of love is that?

17:25.795 --> 17:27.637
<i>But this son...</i>

17:27.797 --> 17:29.299
<i>I couldn't get
him out of my head.</i>

17:32.468 --> 17:35.472
<i>If God is so
perfect and we are not...</i>

17:35.888 --> 17:38.687
why would He want
to create all this?

17:38.849 --> 17:41.227
Why does He need us at all?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.523
All you have to know
is that He loves us.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.905
God so loved this world
that He gave His only son.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.035
<i>The longer
I listened to the priest...</i>

17:50.194 --> 17:53.198
<i>the more I came to like
this son of God.</i>

17:53.364 --> 17:57.335
Thank you, Vishnu,
for introducing me to Christ.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.128
<i>I came to faith
through Hinduism</i>

18:07.253 --> 18:09.506
<i>and I found God's
love through Christ.</i>

18:09.672 --> 18:12.175
<i>But God wasn't
finished with me yet.</i>

18:22.268 --> 18:24.862
<i>God works in mysterious ways.</i>

18:25.021 --> 18:27.524
<i>And so it was,
He introduced Himself again.</i>

18:27.857 --> 18:30.406
<i>This time by the name of Allah.</i>

18:46.083 --> 18:47.710
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

18:50.254 --> 18:52.552
<i>My Arabic
was never very good...</i>

18:52.715 --> 18:56.390
<i>but the sound and feel of the
words brought me closer to God.</i>

18:56.552 --> 18:57.769
<i>In performing Salah...</i>

18:57.928 --> 19:00.101
<i>the ground I touched
became holy ground...</i>

19:00.264 --> 19:03.734
<i>and I found a feeling
of serenity and brotherhood.</i>

19:13.444 --> 19:16.072
This lamb is exquisite.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.791
It's the best
dish on the table.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.959
You're all missing out.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.585
You only need to convert to three
more religions, Piscine...

19:25.748 --> 19:28.922
and you will spend your life on holiday.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.422
Are you going to Mecca
this year, Swami Jesus?

19:32.588 --> 19:35.842
Or to Rome for your
coronation as Pope Pi-us?

19:36.092 --> 19:37.765
You stay out of this, Ravi.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.021
Just as you like cricket,
Pi has his own interests.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.432
No, Gita, Ravi has a point.

19:42.807 --> 19:47.153
You cannot follow three different
religions at the same time, Piscine.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.608
Why not?

19:48.771 --> 19:52.366
Because believing in
everything at the same time...

19:52.525 --> 19:55.779
is the same as not believing
in anything at all.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.119
He's young, Santosh.
He's still finding his way.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.706
And how can he find his way
if he does not choose a path?

20:03.452 --> 20:07.832
Listen, instead of leaping from
one religion to the next...

20:07.998 --> 20:10.000
why not start with reason?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.007
In a few hundred years...

20:12.169 --> 20:14.888
science has taken us farther in
understanding the universe...

20:15.047 --> 20:17.800
than religion has in 10,000.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.350
That is true.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.809
Your father is right.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.518
Science can teach us more
about what is out there...

20:26.684 --> 20:28.482
but not what is in here.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.194
Some eat meat,
some eat vegetable.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.700
I do not expect us all
to agree about everything...

20:34.859 --> 20:36.702
but I would much
rather have you

20:36.777 --> 20:38.529
believe in something
I don't agree with...

20:38.696 --> 20:41.495
than to accept
everything blindly.

20:41.657 --> 20:45.503
And that begins
with thinking rationally.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.669
Do you understand?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.551
Good.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.430
I would like to be baptized.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.435
So, you're a Christian
and a Muslim?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.024
And a Hindu, of course.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.359
And a Jew, I suppose.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.525
Well, I do teach a course on the
Kabbalah at the university.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.365
And why not? Faith is a
house with many rooms.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.120
But no room for doubt?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.952
Oh, plenty.
On every floor.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.536
Doubt is useful.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.747
It keeps faith a living thing.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.083
After all, you cannot know
the strength of your faith

21:28.162 --> 21:29.379
until it's been tested.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.212
Where's Selvam? We shouldn't
be in here without him.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.880
Stop worrying.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.392
I have seen him
do this a thousand times.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.766
I want to meet our new tiger.

21:48.766 --> 21:49.813
Pi!

21:49.892 --> 21:52.566
Hello? Richard Parker?

21:52.937 --> 21:55.941
A tiger? Richard
Parker was a tiger?

21:56.106 --> 21:58.950
Yeah, he got his name
through a clerical error.

21:59.109 --> 22:02.113
A hunter caught him drinking from
a stream when he was a cub...

22:02.279 --> 22:04.077
and named him Thirsty.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.244
When Thirsty got too big, the
hunter sold him to our zoo...

22:07.409 --> 22:10.253
but the names got switched on
the paperwork.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.873
The hunter was listed
as Thirsty,

22:12.957 --> 22:14.834
and the tiger
was called Richard Parker.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.637
We laughed about it,
and the name stuck.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.506
Let's go...

22:21.257 --> 22:23.476
before we get into trouble.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.477
I want to see him close up.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.104
You're not a zookeeper.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.106
Come on!

22:47.449 --> 22:49.622
That's it, Richard Parker.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.503
It's for you.

23:20.983 --> 23:21.984
No!

23:23.193 --> 23:25.321
What are you thinking?

23:25.821 --> 23:27.164
Are you out of your mind?

23:27.323 --> 23:29.371
Who gave you permission
to come back here?

23:29.533 --> 23:32.912
You have just ignored everything
I've ever taught you.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.256
I just wanted to
say hello to him.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.505
You think that tiger
is your friend?

23:38.667 --> 23:41.011
He's an animal, not a playmate.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.344
Animals have souls.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.850
I have seen it in their eyes.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.097
Find Selvam.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.777
You're sure, Sir?
Pi's just a boy.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.862
Do it. Go ahead!

24:07.863 --> 24:10.537
Animals do not think
like we do.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.543
People who forget that
get themselves killed.

24:13.702 --> 24:17.878
That tiger is not your friend.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.542
When you look into his eyes...

24:19.708 --> 24:23.133
you are seeing your own
emotions reflected back at you.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.047
Nothing else.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.141
Don't be stupid.
Say you're sorry.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.761
What have you done, Piscine?

24:30.928 --> 24:33.226
You know what your father
said about coming back here.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.234
I am sorry. I was...

24:37.726 --> 24:39.148
What are you thinking?

24:39.311 --> 24:41.063
This is between
a father and his sons.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.317
He said he's sorry.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.951
You want to scar them for life?

24:46.110 --> 24:49.080
Scar them?
That boy almost lost his arm.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.581
But he's still a boy.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.457
He will be a man
sooner than you think.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.586
And this is a lesson I do not
want them ever to forget.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.750
Selvam!

25:45.836 --> 25:48.756
<i>...and so has placed
the country in a state of emergency.</i>

25:48.839 --> 25:52.139
<i>Under the directive, the states
of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu...</i>

25:52.301 --> 25:55.350
<i>will be placed under the direct
authority of the central government.</i>

25:55.512 --> 25:57.230
<i>Police will be granted powers...</i>

25:57.389 --> 25:59.733
<i>to arrest and indefinitely
detain citizens</i>

25:59.808 --> 26:01.526
<i>responsible for the uprising.</i>

26:06.065 --> 26:09.820
<i>Things changed after
the day of Appa's lesson.</i>

26:09.985 --> 26:12.659
<i>The world had lost
some of its enchantment.</i>

26:13.155 --> 26:16.830
<i>School was a bore. Nothing but
facts, fractions and French.</i>

26:17.367 --> 26:21.417
<i>Words and patterns that went
on and on, without end.</i>

26:21.580 --> 26:24.083
<i>Just like
my irrational nickname.</i>

26:29.004 --> 26:31.553
<i>I grew restless
searching for something</i>

26:31.673 --> 26:34.267
<i>that might bring meaning
back into my life.</i>

26:35.427 --> 26:38.101
<i>And then, I met Anandi.</i>

26:47.064 --> 26:48.862
<i>Mother made me study music.</i>

26:49.024 --> 26:51.447
<i>And one day, my teacher
came down with the flu.</i>

26:52.027 --> 26:53.745
<i>He asked if
I could take his place,</i>

26:53.821 --> 26:55.619
<i>playing rhythms
for a dance class.</i>

27:11.880 --> 27:13.097
No.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.217
If you do not concentrate...

27:15.384 --> 27:18.763
you cannot express your
love of God through dance.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.057
Feel the ground
beneath your feet.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.726
Open your gaze out
onto the horizon.

27:23.892 --> 27:28.443
Let that spiritual energy pulse
through you and out into the world.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.570
Through <i>abhinaya</i>.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.827
Anandi, come to the front.
Lead them.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.616
Why are you following me?

28:20.782 --> 28:21.874
What?

28:22.284 --> 28:24.662
You were following me.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.133
What does this mean?

28:30.500 --> 28:33.219
In the dance,
you went from pataka...

28:33.795 --> 28:35.843
which means the forest.

28:36.006 --> 28:38.805
And then you did...

28:40.010 --> 28:41.353
<i>samputa...</i>

28:41.511 --> 28:44.185
which means
something that is hidden.

28:44.348 --> 28:45.975
And after that, you did this.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.195
And then you did <i>chatura.</i>

28:50.354 --> 28:53.904
But at the very end,
you did this.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.323
None of the other
dancers did that.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.656
What did you mean? The god of
love is hiding in the forest?

29:00.822 --> 29:03.666
No, that also means
the lotus flower.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.499
Lotus flower
is hiding in the forest?

29:07.663 --> 29:10.416
Why would a lotus flower
hide in the forest?

29:18.340 --> 29:20.434
And this is Richard Parker.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.807
He is the most
magnificent creature

29:22.886 --> 29:24.513
we've ever had here.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.691
Look at the way
he's turning his head.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.900
Showing off. Like a dancer.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.361
No, he heard something.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.329
He's listening, you see?

29:49.871 --> 29:51.873
We have talked
about it for some time.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.213
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

29:54.376 --> 29:55.719
Pi?

29:56.962 --> 29:58.714
Sorry, you've been...

29:58.880 --> 30:00.427
Worried.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.388
For my family.

30:02.551 --> 30:05.555
Our animals are worth far more
abroad than here in India.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.723
And if the town council
stops supporting us...

30:07.889 --> 30:09.732
I don't know where we will be.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.269
So, it is what we have to do.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.151
Do you understand?

30:17.232 --> 30:19.234
I'm sorry,
what are we talking about?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.820
We are leaving India.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.657
What?

30:26.575 --> 30:28.248
We are selling the zoo.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.123
The zoo was never ours to sell.
The land belongs to the town.

30:32.289 --> 30:34.417
But the animals are ours
and if we sell them...

30:34.583 --> 30:36.677
we will have enough
to start a new life.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.089
But where would we go?
Our life is here, <i>Appa.</i>

30:40.255 --> 30:41.256
Canada.

30:41.423 --> 30:44.097
I have some opportunities
for work in Winnipeg.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.263
I'll be shipping most of the
animals for sale in North America.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.978
We can get freighter passage
for the whole family.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.600
So...

30:51.767 --> 30:53.360
It is settled.

30:53.518 --> 30:56.271
We will sail like Columbus.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.529
But Columbus
was looking for India.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.869
<i>It takes
a lot of work to sell a zoo.</i>

31:11.620 --> 31:12.712
<i>Before we left...</i>

31:12.788 --> 31:16.509
<i>Anandi and I had time enough
to break each other's hearts.</i>

31:16.958 --> 31:20.337
<i>Of course, I promised
I would come back one day.</i>

31:21.171 --> 31:22.673
<i>It's funny.</i>

31:22.839 --> 31:25.968
<i>I remember everything else
about our last day.</i>

31:26.134 --> 31:29.229
<i>But I don't remember
saying goodbye.</i>

31:37.646 --> 31:41.196
Pi? They're
serving dinner below.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.002
Piscine...

31:56.164 --> 31:58.667
you have a whole life
ahead of you.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.012
We are doing this
for you and Ravi.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.384
Come inside
and have some dinner.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.690
Vegetarian, please.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.899
Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians.
Do you have anything...

32:22.065 --> 32:25.194
No, no, no.
Not more gravy.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.112
You don't want gravy?
No.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.240
No, I want something
vegetarian.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.576
Oh.

32:34.494 --> 32:35.711
<i>Pas de problème.</i>

32:37.539 --> 32:41.260
She asked if you have
something vegetarian.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.056
The cow that produced
this liver was vegetarian,

32:46.214 --> 32:49.138
the pigs that went into
these sausages were vegetarian.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.594
Very funny.

32:51.219 --> 32:54.063
But my wife doesn't eat liver.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.523
<i>Pas de problème.</i>

32:58.894 --> 33:02.489
Then she can eat the sausage,
the rice, and the gravy.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.983
Or you can cook your own food.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.820
Haw dare you talk
to my wife like that?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.285
Here's your rice.

33:11.948 --> 33:14.076
I cook for sailors...

33:14.159 --> 33:15.752
not curry-eaters.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.412
What did you say?

33:17.621 --> 33:18.463
Let go of me!

33:18.538 --> 33:22.133
Who do you think you are?
You're nothing but a servant!

33:22.209 --> 33:24.758
I feed people!
You feed monkeys!

33:33.428 --> 33:34.930
Hello.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.643
I am happy Buddhist.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.600
So, I eat rice

33:38.683 --> 33:40.606
next to gravy.

33:40.936 --> 33:44.315
On ship, gravy is not meat.

33:44.481 --> 33:45.653
Is taste.

33:46.358 --> 33:47.701
You try?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.384
Don't worry.

34:12.551 --> 34:17.681
We will have plenty of fresh
supplies after we stop in Manila.

34:19.516 --> 34:23.146
Why give Orange Juice
tranquilizers?

34:23.311 --> 34:26.235
She's not going to
cause any trouble.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.368
The stress of traveling
is not good for the animals...

34:29.525 --> 34:32.324
and it helps
with the seasickness.

34:33.487 --> 34:39.666
We don't want to be cleaning up
after a seasick orangutan...

34:40.245 --> 34:41.496
do we?

34:47.918 --> 34:50.047
<i>My father was a businessman.</i>

34:50.130 --> 34:52.553
<i>He had never tended
the animals himself.</i>

34:54.384 --> 34:55.431
I realized...

34:55.594 --> 34:59.565
leaving India must have been
harder for him than it was for me.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.780
So...

35:07.230 --> 35:09.403
Have I forgotten anything?

35:09.566 --> 35:10.726
I think you've set the stage.

35:10.859 --> 35:14.238
So far, we have an Indian boy named
after a French swimming pool...

35:14.404 --> 35:17.704
on a Japanese ship full of
animals, heading to Canada.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.118
Yes.

35:19.284 --> 35:23.039
Now, we have to send our boy into
the middle of the Pacific and...

35:23.204 --> 35:26.208
And make me believe in God.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.086
Yeah.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.129
We'll get there.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.766
It was four days
out of Manila...

35:38.928 --> 35:42.057
above the Mariana Trench,
the deepest spot on Earth.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.697
<i>Our ship,
The Tsimtsum, pushed on,</i>

35:48.813 --> 35:51.817
<i>bullishly indifferent
to its surroundings.</i>

35:52.776 --> 35:57.156
<i>It moved with the slow, massive
confidence of a continent.</i>

36:33.608 --> 36:34.825
Ravi?

36:35.610 --> 36:36.953
Did you hear that, Ravi?

36:37.112 --> 36:38.329
I'm sleeping.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.490
It's a thunderstorm.
Let's go watch.

36:40.657 --> 36:41.954
Are you crazy?

36:42.367 --> 36:44.210
We will get hit by lightning.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.296
No, we won't. It will
hit the bridge first.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.168
Don't tempt a storm, Pi.

37:04.639 --> 37:05.936
Whoa.

37:19.529 --> 37:20.655
Oh!

37:55.106 --> 37:58.952
More rain! More rain!

38:01.488 --> 38:03.957
Lord of Storms!

38:04.240 --> 38:05.583
Whoa!

38:06.451 --> 38:07.998
Lightning!

38:26.054 --> 38:27.055
Ah!

38:47.617 --> 38:49.085
<i>Amma!</i>

38:50.411 --> 38:51.503
<i>Appa!</i>

38:53.081 --> 38:56.802
Ravi! Get out! Get out!

39:34.455 --> 39:36.423
Help me!

39:41.629 --> 39:42.972
Help!

39:45.174 --> 39:46.471
Get in the boat!

39:46.634 --> 39:48.636
Please! Save my family!

39:48.803 --> 39:50.601
Don't scare, okay?
Wait, stay here!

39:50.763 --> 39:52.356
You have to help them!
Please!

39:52.515 --> 39:53.812
Put this on.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.398
No, no, my family!
Please!

39:58.730 --> 40:00.152
We have to help them!

40:00.315 --> 40:02.613
We don't have time.
My family's back there!

40:02.775 --> 40:05.028
We help!
You must go!

40:05.194 --> 40:06.366
Who let all the animals out?

40:06.529 --> 40:07.781
You have to go now!

40:07.947 --> 40:10.245
No, wait, my father!
He can't swim!

40:10.325 --> 40:11.372
Go!

40:14.287 --> 40:17.257
Hang on to the boat!
Hold, hold!

40:18.499 --> 40:20.092
Bring it down!

40:28.009 --> 40:31.013
Hey! You!
What are you doing?

40:32.639 --> 40:33.686
Jump!

40:34.057 --> 40:36.059
Hey, hey!

41:39.038 --> 41:43.464
Hey! Over here!
Over here!

42:18.119 --> 42:19.837
Richard Parker?

42:19.996 --> 42:21.669
No! No!

42:22.582 --> 42:25.756
No! Go away! Go away!

44:14.735 --> 44:16.237
Agh!

44:34.839 --> 44:37.718
<i>Amma!</i>

44:37.884 --> 44:41.855
<i>Appa!</i> Ravi.

44:43.389 --> 44:46.233
I'm sorry.

44:48.436 --> 44:51.861
I'm sorry!

46:35.209 --> 46:36.301
Hari?

47:11.787 --> 47:14.836
Looks as though your drugs
haven't worn off yet.

47:29.138 --> 47:33.860
Orange Juice!
Orange Juice!

47:47.239 --> 47:49.367
Welcome to Pi's Ark.

48:14.266 --> 48:16.485
Where is your boy,
Orange Juice?

48:26.529 --> 48:30.909
Don't worry, I bet mother
and father found him.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.877
They'll all be here soon.

48:44.755 --> 48:47.224
Hello!

48:50.344 --> 48:53.018
Hello!

48:55.057 --> 48:58.106
Anybody!

50:01.332 --> 50:02.584
No!

50:02.958 --> 50:07.964
Stop it! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

50:10.966 --> 50:11.466
No! No!

51:01.016 --> 51:02.563
I'm sorry, Orange Juice.

51:02.726 --> 51:05.900
I don't have any seasickness
medicine for you.

51:07.022 --> 51:10.117
Supplies.
Oh, supplies!

52:17.551 --> 52:20.100
Yes! Yes!

52:30.064 --> 52:31.737
No! No!

52:32.900 --> 52:34.573
No! No!

52:54.755 --> 52:57.133
Come on! Come on!

52:57.591 --> 52:59.013
Come on!

54:46.450 --> 54:47.451
Mmm.

57:41.792 --> 57:44.215
<i>My name is Pi Patel.</i>

57:44.711 --> 57:47.214
<i>I have been in a shipwreck.</i>

57:47.881 --> 57:50.555
<i>I am on a lifeboat alone...</i>

57:52.803 --> 57:54.055
<i>with a tiger.</i>

57:56.056 --> 57:58.058
<i>Please send help.</i>

59:45.540 --> 59:49.886
God, I give myself to you.

59:50.420 --> 59:52.923
I am your vessel.

59:54.674 --> 59:58.554
Whatever comes, I want to know.

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.357
Show me.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.737
There are no lines.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:23.037
<i>Set your house in order and
dig in for the battle to survive.</i>

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.839
<i>Establish a strict
schedule for eating,</i>

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.379
<i>keeping watch and getting rest.</i>

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:32.296
<i>Do not drink
urine or sea water.</i>

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:38.390
<i>Keep busy but avoid
unnecessary exertion.</i>

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:43.728
<i>The mind can be kept occupied
by playing card games...</i>

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:47.228
<i>Twenty Questions, or! Spy.</i>

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:54.072
<i>Community singing is another
surefire way to lift the spirits.</i>

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:59.827
<i>Telling stories
is highly recommended.</i>

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:06.959
<i>Above all, don't lose hope.</i>

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:19.180
<i>Few things can sap the spirit
faster than seasickness.</i>

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:25.191
<i>Waves are most strongly felt when a
boat turns sideways to the current.</i>

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:29.979
<i>A sea anchor is used as a drag to
keep the boat's head to the wind.</i>

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.819
<i>Proper use of them
can increase control</i>

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:35.613
<i>and reduce seasickness
during rough seas.</i>

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:39.742
<i>For castaways who must share
their lifeboats with large,</i>

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:41.198
<i>dangerous carnivores...</i>

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:44.660
<i>it's advisable to establish
a territory as your own.</i>

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.328
<i>Try this method.</i>

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:47.586
<i>Step one.</i>

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:50.791
<i>Choose a day when waves are
moderate, but regular.</i>

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:54.170
<i>Step two. With the lifeboat
facing into the waves...</i>

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:58.800
<i>making the ride as comfortable as
possible, blow your whistle soothingly.</i>

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:02.511
<i>Step three. Turn the lifeboat
sideways to the waves...</i>

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:05.856
<i>accompanied by harsh,
aggressive use of the whistle.</i>

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:07.641
<i>With sufficient repetition...</i>

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.935
<i>the animal will associate
the sound of the whistle...</i>

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:12.567
<i>with the discomfort
of seasickness.</i>

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:16.404
<i>Similar methods have long been
used by circus trainers...</i>

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.661
<i>though they generally lack
access to rough seas.</i>

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:22.827
Let the trumpets blare!

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:26.744
Let the drum rolls begin!

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:30.171
Prepare to be amazed!

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:34.551
Here it is, for your
enjoyment and instruction!

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:39.514
The show you've been waiting
for all your life...

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.643
will soon begin!

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.267
Are you ready for
the miracle of it?

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.434
Well, then, I give to you...

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.026
the astounding Bengal tiger!

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:10.379
Hello, Richard Parker.
Sorry about the choppy ride.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:49.285
Mine! You understand?
Yours, mine!

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.422
You understand?

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:03.424
Ew!

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:08.095
<i>Step four.</i>

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.856
<i>Disregard steps
one through three.</i>

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:43.968
Here, Richard Parker.
I got some water for you.

01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:02.317
<i>In the zoo, we fed our tigers an
average of five kilos of meat a day.</i>

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:06.028
<i>Richard Parker
will be getting hungry soon.</i>

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:11.575
<i>Tigers are powerful swimmers,
and if he gets hungry enough...</i>

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:13.752
<i>I'm afraid the little
bit of water between us</i>

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.875
<i>won't be any protection.</i>

01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:18.540
<i>I need to find a way
to feed him.</i>

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:22.256
<i>I can eat the biscuits but God
made tigers carnivores...</i>

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:24.508
<i>so I must learn to catch fish.</i>

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.390
<i>If I don't,
I'm afraid his last meal</i>

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.684
<i>will be a skinny,
vegetarian boy.</i>

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:41.567
Patience!

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.654
What am I doing?

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:10.216
Wait! I'm thinking.

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:42.808
Thirty-two cartons
of biscuits.

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.608
Ninety-three cans of water.

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:01.345
I'm sorry.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.678
I'm sorry.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:10.601
Thank you, Lord Vishnu.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:14.897
Thank you for coming in the form
of a fish and saving our lives.

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:17.695
Thank you.

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:28.405
<i>Of course, I brought all
the biscuits and water</i>

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:31.081
<i>on the raft with me
to keep them safe.</i>

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.496
<i>Idiot.</i>

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:38.256
<i>Hunger can
change everything you</i>

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:40.584
<i>ever thought you
knew about yourself.</i>

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:32.764
Here, it's yours!

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:48.318
Oh! Ah!

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.172
Mine! Mine!

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:50.815
<i>I can't risk my life every time</i>

01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:53.697
<i>I have to climb
onto the boat for supplies.</i>

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.032
<i>It's time to settle this.</i>

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.076
<i>If we're going
to live together,</i>

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.704
<i>we have to learn
to communicate.</i>

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:03.494
<i>Maybe Richard Parker
can't be tamed,</i>

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:06.376
<i>but with God's will,
he can be trained.</i>

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:17.364
No!

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:27.791
Good.

01:19:46.699 --> 01:19:49.953
Go, Richard Parker. Go.

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:52.918
Go on home,
I'll leave you alone.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.050
I'll respect that, I promise.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:02.715
Go. Come on.

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.391
Yes!

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:49.019
<i>I never thought
a small piece of shade</i>

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.813
<i>could bring me
so much happiness.</i>

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:57.275
<i>That a pile of tools,
a bucket, a knife, a pencil...</i>

01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.484
<i>might become my
greatest treasures.</i>

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:03.784
<i>Or that knowing Richard Parker was
here might ever bring me peace.</i>

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.286
<i>In times like these...</i>

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.698
<i>I remember that he has
as little experience</i>

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:11.330
<i>with the real world as I do.</i>

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:14.837
<i>We were both raised in a zoo
by the same master.</i>

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:19.967
<i>Now we've been orphaned, left to
face our ultimate master together.</i>

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:23.675
<i>Without Richard Parker,
I would have died by now.</i>

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:26.181
<i>My fear of him keeps me alert.</i>

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.640
<i>Tending to his needs
gives my life purpose.</i>

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.062
Dolphins.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.353
Hey, Richard Parker!

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:57.413
Hey!

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:53.720
<i>Above all, don't lose hope.</i>

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:29.634
Eight, five, five,
zero, three, six, six...

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:32.304
zero, eight, zero, one...

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:37.267
three, six, zero, four,
six, six, eight...

01:23:45.103 --> 01:23:47.481
What are you looking at?

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.029
Talk to me.

01:23:57.658 --> 01:23:59.877
Tell me what you see.

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:10.090
<i>Words are all I have
left to hang on to.</i>

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:14.011
<i>Everything mixed up.
Fragmented.</i>

01:26:14.586 --> 01:26:19.763
<i>Can't tell daydreams, night
dreams, from reality anymo...</i>

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.945
Storm, Richard Parker.

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:08.815
No!

01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:15.564
No!

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:42.386
Praise be to God!

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.059
Lord of all worlds!

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:48.848
The compassionate,
the merciful!

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.227
Ah!

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:57.189
Come out.

01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:02.866
Richard Parker! Come out,
you have to see this!

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.864
It's beautiful!

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:21.051
Don't hide yourself!
He's come to us!

01:28:21.213 --> 01:28:22.886
It's a miracle!

01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:40.073
Come out and see God,
Richard Parker!

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:56.082
Why are you scaring him?

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:57.249
Oh, God!

01:28:57.415 --> 01:29:02.091
I've lost my family!
I've lost everything!

01:29:02.254 --> 01:29:06.680
I surrender!
What more do you want?

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:32.334
I'm sorry, Richard Parker.

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:42.934
We're dying, Richard Parker.

01:32:46.644 --> 01:32:49.147
I'm sorry.

01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:25.855
<i>Amma, Appa,</i> Ravi...

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:31.194
I'm happy I'm going
to see you soon.

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:42.994
Can you feel the rain?

01:34:01.511 --> 01:34:06.392
God, thank you for
giving me my life.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.562
I'm ready now.

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:43.770
Richard Parker?

01:35:32.018 --> 01:35:33.691
Mmm.

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:24.199
Excuse me.

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:26.664
Move.

01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:29.868
Move. Excuse me.

01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:44.469
Hey! Hey!

01:38:45.336 --> 01:38:46.838
Hey, come on!

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:50.842
Hey.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:55.268
Hey, get away.
This is my bed.

01:41:03.474 --> 01:41:05.897
<i>It was a human tooth?</i>

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:09.155
Don't you see? The
island was carnivorous.

01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:12.157
Carnivorous?
Like a Venus Flytrap?

01:41:12.316 --> 01:41:15.160
Yes, the whole island.

01:41:15.319 --> 01:41:19.790
The plants, the water in those
pools, the very ground itself.

01:41:20.491 --> 01:41:23.461
During the day, those
pools held fresh water.

01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:25.747
But at night,
some chemical process

01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:28.834
turned the water
in those pools into acid...

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:32.011
acid that dissolved
those fish...

01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:34.672
that sent the meerkats
scurrying into the trees,

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:36.974
and Richard Parker
running to the boat.

01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:39.135
But where did
the tooth come from?

01:41:39.302 --> 01:41:42.101
Years ago, some poor fellow,
just like me...

01:41:42.263 --> 01:41:45.016
must have found himself
stranded on that island...

01:41:45.182 --> 01:41:48.527
and, like me, thought he
might stay there forever.

01:41:48.686 --> 01:41:53.533
But all that the island gave him by
day, it took away again by night.

01:41:55.026 --> 01:42:00.203
To think, how many hours spent
with only meerkats for company.

01:42:00.364 --> 01:42:02.787
How much loneliness taken on.

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:05.378
All I know is that
eventually he died

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:07.455
and the island digested him...

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:10.375
leaving behind only his teeth.

01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:15.179
I saw how my life would end
if I stayed on that island.

01:42:15.338 --> 01:42:17.056
Alone and forgotten.

01:42:17.882 --> 01:42:22.558
I had to get back to the
world, or die trying.

01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:29.189
<i>I spent the next day
preparing the boat.</i>

01:42:29.352 --> 01:42:31.400
<i>I filled my stores
with fresh water...</i>

01:42:31.646 --> 01:42:34.240
<i>ate seaweed until my stomach
could take no more...</i>

01:42:34.398 --> 01:42:36.742
<i>and brought as many
meerkats as I could fit</i>

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:39.912
<i>into the storage locker
for Richard Parker.</i>

01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:43.166
<i>I couldn't leave
without him, of course.</i>

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:45.167
<i>It would mean killing him.</i>

01:42:46.911 --> 01:42:49.881
<i>And so,
I waited for his return.</i>

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.922
<i>I knew he wouldn't be late.</i>

01:42:54.085 --> 01:42:57.589
Richard Parker!

01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:12.437
<i>No one has seen that
floating island since.</i>

01:43:12.603 --> 01:43:15.903
<i>And you won't read about those
trees in any nature book.</i>

01:43:16.065 --> 01:43:20.115
<i>And yet, if I hadn't found those
shores, I would have died.</i>

01:43:20.277 --> 01:43:22.621
<i>If I hadn't
discovered that tooth,</i>

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:25.792
<i>I would have been lost,
alone forever.</i>

01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:28.453
<i>Even when God seemed
to have abandoned me...</i>

01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:30.121
<i>He was watching.</i>

01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:33.086
<i>Even when He seemed indifferent
to my suffering...</i>

01:43:33.249 --> 01:43:34.717
<i>He was watching.</i>

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:38.721
<i>And when I was beyond all hope
of saving, He gave me rest...</i>

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:41.974
<i>then gave me a sign
to continue my journey.</i>

01:43:54.812 --> 01:43:57.361
<i>By the time we reached
the Mexican shore,</i>

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.239
<i>I was afraid to
let go of the boat.</i>

01:44:00.776 --> 01:44:04.155
<i>My strength was gone.
I was so weak.</i>

01:44:04.321 --> 01:44:08.121
<i>I was afraid that in two feet of
water, so close to deliverance...</i>

01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:10.332
<i>I would drown.</i>

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:23.592
<i>I struggled to shore
and fell upon the sand.</i>

01:44:23.758 --> 01:44:25.510
<i>It was warm and soft...</i>

01:44:25.676 --> 01:44:28.976
<i>like pressing my face
against the cheek of God.</i>

01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:34.353
<i>And somewhere, two eyes were
smiling at having me there.</i>

01:44:38.355 --> 01:44:42.110
<i>I was so spent,
I could hardly move.</i>

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:51.289
<i>And so, Richard Parker
went ahead of me.</i>

01:44:52.661 --> 01:44:56.711
<i>He stretched his legs
and walked along the shore.</i>

01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:03.715
<i>At the edge of the jungle,
he stopped.</i>

01:45:03.881 --> 01:45:06.350
<i>I was certain he was going
to look back at me...</i>

01:45:06.634 --> 01:45:09.729
<i>flatten his ears
to his head, growl.</i>

01:45:09.887 --> 01:45:13.983
<i>That he would bring our
relationship to an end in some way.</i>

01:45:15.893 --> 01:45:19.067
<i>But he just stared ahead
into the jungle.</i>

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:25.244
And then, Richard Parker,
my fierce companion...

01:45:25.402 --> 01:45:28.076
the terrible one
who kept me alive...

01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:34.496
disappeared
forever from my life.

01:45:40.501 --> 01:45:44.005
<i>After a few hours, a member
of my own species found me.</i>

01:45:44.505 --> 01:45:47.600
<i>He left and returned with a
group who carried me away.</i>

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.058
<i>I wept like a child.</i>

01:45:52.221 --> 01:45:56.567
<i>Not because I was overwhelmed at
having survived, although I was.</i>

01:45:57.434 --> 01:46:03.612
<i>I was weeping because Richard
Parker left me so unceremoniously.</i>

01:46:05.067 --> 01:46:07.616
<i>It broke my heart.</i>

01:46:13.075 --> 01:46:15.954
You know, my father was right.

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.873
Richard Parker never
saw me as his friend.

01:46:19.456 --> 01:46:23.381
After all we had been through,
he didn't even look back.

01:46:24.545 --> 01:46:26.545
But I have to believe there
was more in his eyes...

01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:29.593
than my own reflection
staring back at me.

01:46:29.758 --> 01:46:32.056
I know it.
I felt it.

01:46:32.928 --> 01:46:35.147
Even if I can't prove it.

01:46:40.436 --> 01:46:41.938
You know,
I've left so much behind.

01:46:42.104 --> 01:46:45.483
My family, the zoo,
India, Anandi.

01:46:45.816 --> 01:46:49.912
I suppose, in the end, the whole of
life becomes an act of letting go.

01:46:50.654 --> 01:46:53.498
But what always
hurts the most...

01:46:53.657 --> 01:46:57.287
is not taking a moment
to say goodbye.

01:46:58.996 --> 01:47:03.172
I was never able to thank my
father for all I learned from him.

01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:06.338
To tell him,
without his lessons...

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:09.174
I would never have survived.

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.975
I know Richard Parker is a
tiger, but I wish I had said...

01:47:15.137 --> 01:47:17.811
"It's over.
We survived."

01:47:17.973 --> 01:47:21.773
"Thank you for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker."

01:47:21.936 --> 01:47:24.655
"You will always
be with me."

01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:28.534
"May God be with you."

01:47:35.699 --> 01:47:38.043
I don't know what to say.

01:47:44.375 --> 01:47:46.969
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

01:47:49.964 --> 01:47:52.183
It is a lot to take in.

01:47:52.549 --> 01:47:55.302
To figure out
what it all means.

01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:56.641
If it happened, it happened.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.314
Why should it have
to mean anything?

01:48:00.849 --> 01:48:03.819
Some of it is
pretty incredible.

01:48:03.978 --> 01:48:06.322
See, I was the only one
who survived the shipwreck.

01:48:06.897 --> 01:48:10.071
So the Japanese shipping company
sent two men to talk to me...

01:48:10.234 --> 01:48:13.078
in the Mexican hospital
where I was recovering.

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:17.078
I still have a copy
of their report.

01:48:19.243 --> 01:48:22.338
They had insurance claims
to settle...

01:48:22.496 --> 01:48:25.420
and they wanted to find out
why the ship sank.

01:48:26.417 --> 01:48:27.885
They didn't believe me, either.

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:34.846
Thousands of meerkats on a
floating carnivorous island...

01:48:35.009 --> 01:48:36.932
and no one has ever seen it?

01:48:37.094 --> 01:48:39.893
Yes, just like I told you.

01:48:40.055 --> 01:48:41.773
Bananas don't float.

01:48:41.932 --> 01:48:43.434
Why are you
talking about bananas?

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.274
You said the orangutan floated
to you on a bundle of bananas.

01:48:46.437 --> 01:48:48.280
But bananas don't float.

01:48:48.439 --> 01:48:49.782
Are you sure about that?

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.443
Of course they do.
Try it for yourself.

01:48:53.402 --> 01:48:57.578
In any case, we are not here to
talk about bananas or meerkats.

01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:01.085
Look, I’ve just told you along
story and I'm very tired.

01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:06.124
We are here because a Japanese
cargo ship sank in the Pacific.

01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:08.759
Something I never forget.

01:49:09.918 --> 01:49:12.387
I lost my whole family.

01:49:17.134 --> 01:49:18.807
Get him some water.

01:49:21.263 --> 01:49:23.482
We don't mean to push you.

01:49:24.558 --> 01:49:27.437
And you have our
deepest sympathies.

01:49:27.603 --> 01:49:29.605
But we have come a long way...

01:49:29.772 --> 01:49:32.946
and we are no closer to
understanding why the ship sank.

01:49:33.108 --> 01:49:35.236
Because I don't know.

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:36.949
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.

01:49:37.112 --> 01:49:39.661
It could have been an
explosion, I can't be sure.

01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:41.746
And then the ship sank.

01:49:42.284 --> 01:49:43.957
What else do you want from me?

01:49:44.119 --> 01:49:46.417
A story that won't make us
look like fools.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.584
We need a simpler story
for our report.

01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:51.923
One our company can understand.

01:49:52.169 --> 01:49:54.672
A story we can all believe.

01:49:57.508 --> 01:50:00.512
So, a story without things
you've never seen before.

01:50:01.011 --> 01:50:02.354
That's right.

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:06.689
Without surprises. Without
animals or islands.

01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:09.524
Yes. The truth.

01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:20.869
So, what did you do?

01:50:25.035 --> 01:50:27.379
I told them another story.

01:50:28.205 --> 01:50:29.377
Four of us survived.

01:50:30.249 --> 01:50:32.798
The cook and the sailor
were already aboard.

01:50:33.085 --> 01:50:34.928
The cook threw me a lifebuoy
and pulled me aboard...

01:50:35.087 --> 01:50:38.637
and Mother held on to some bananas
and made it to the lifeboat.

01:50:40.217 --> 01:50:43.221
The cook was a disgusting man.

01:50:43.387 --> 01:50:45.606
He ate a rat.

01:50:45.764 --> 01:50:48.893
We had food enough for weeks, but he
found the rat in the first few days...

01:50:49.059 --> 01:50:52.734
and he killed it, dried
it in the sun and ate it.

01:50:52.896 --> 01:50:55.115
He was such a brute, that man.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:59.244
But he was resourceful.

01:50:59.945 --> 01:51:03.575
It was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish.

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:06.960
We would have died in those
first few days without him.

01:51:09.246 --> 01:51:13.752
The sailor was the same man who
brought rice and gravy, the Buddhist.

01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:17.296
We didn't understand much of what he
said, only that he was suffering.

01:51:17.754 --> 01:51:19.927
He had broken his leg
horribly in the fall.

01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:23.185
We tried to set it as best we could,
but the leg became infected...

01:51:23.594 --> 01:51:28.100
and the cook said that we had
to do something or he'd die.

01:51:28.599 --> 01:51:29.646
The cook said he'd do it,

01:51:29.766 --> 01:51:32.110
but Mother and I had
to hold the man down.

01:51:32.186 --> 01:51:34.780
And I believed him,
we needed to do it.

01:51:35.439 --> 01:51:37.282
So...

01:51:38.942 --> 01:51:42.037
I kept saying,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

01:51:42.196 --> 01:51:46.042
And he just kept looking at me.
His eyes were so...

01:51:49.203 --> 01:51:52.673
I'll never understand the point
of that man's suffering.

01:51:53.832 --> 01:51:56.051
I can still hear him.

01:51:56.793 --> 01:52:00.468
The happy Buddhist,
he only ate rice and gravy.

01:52:05.677 --> 01:52:07.725
We didn't save him, of course.

01:52:07.888 --> 01:52:09.310
He died.

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:12.510
The morning after, the cook
caught his first dorado...

01:52:12.643 --> 01:52:15.692
and I didn't understand what he had
done at first, but Mother did...

01:52:15.854 --> 01:52:18.824
and I had never seen
Mother so angry.

01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:21.573
"Stop whining and
be happy," he said.

01:52:21.735 --> 01:52:24.579
"We need more food or we'll die.
That was the whole point."

01:52:24.738 --> 01:52:26.661
"What was the whole point?"
Mother asked.

01:52:26.823 --> 01:52:30.919
"You let that poor boy die in
order to get bait, you monster!"

01:52:32.412 --> 01:52:33.584
The cook got furious.

01:52:33.664 --> 01:52:35.666
He started towards her
with his fist raised...

01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:38.881
and Mother slapped him hard,
right across the face.

01:52:39.044 --> 01:52:40.921
I was stunned.

01:52:41.088 --> 01:52:43.557
I thought he was going
to kill her right then.

01:52:44.883 --> 01:52:46.760
But he didn't.

01:52:48.679 --> 01:52:51.398
The cook didn't stop
at bait either, no.

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:54.192
The sailor...

01:52:55.936 --> 01:52:58.280
He went the same
way the rat went.

01:53:01.024 --> 01:53:03.527
The cook was a resourceful man.

01:53:07.698 --> 01:53:09.871
It was a week later that he...

01:53:11.576 --> 01:53:13.749
Because of me.

01:53:13.912 --> 01:53:16.882
Because I couldn't
hold on to a stupid turtle.

01:53:17.416 --> 01:53:19.919
It slipped out of my hands
and swam away.

01:53:20.085 --> 01:53:22.429
And the cook came up and he punched
me on the side of my head...

01:53:22.587 --> 01:53:24.806
and my teeth clacked
and I saw stars.

01:53:24.965 --> 01:53:26.137
I thought he was
going to hit me again...

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:28.340
but Mother started pounding
on him with her fists...

01:53:28.427 --> 01:53:30.225
screaming,
"Monster, monster!"

01:53:30.387 --> 01:53:31.855
She yelled at me
to go to the raft.

01:53:33.765 --> 01:53:36.564
I thought she was coming with
me, or I'd never have...

01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:42.107
I don't know why I didn't
make her go first.

01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:46.453
I think about that every day.

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:56.167
I jumped over and turned back
just as the knife came out.

01:54:00.083 --> 01:54:02.586
There wasn't anything
I could do.

01:54:04.421 --> 01:54:06.423
I couldn't look away.

01:54:10.635 --> 01:54:13.104
He threw her body overboard.

01:54:14.765 --> 01:54:18.611
And then the sharks came.
And I saw what they...

01:54:23.315 --> 01:54:24.942
I saw.

01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:33.625
The next day, I killed him.

01:54:34.785 --> 01:54:37.629
He didn't even fight back. He
knew he had gone too far...

01:54:37.788 --> 01:54:39.961
even by his own standards.

01:54:41.833 --> 01:54:43.380
He'd left the knife
out on the bench,

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:46.634
and I did to him what
he did to the sailor.

01:54:49.383 --> 01:54:52.637
He was such an evil man,
but worse still, he...

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:57.353
He brought the evil out in me.

01:54:58.809 --> 01:55:01.187
And I have to live with that.

01:55:07.901 --> 01:55:10.654
I was alone in a lifeboat...

01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:14.374
drifting across
the Pacific Ocean.

01:55:15.075 --> 01:55:16.918
And I survived.

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:25.340
After that, they
had no more questions.

01:55:25.502 --> 01:55:29.177
The investigators didn't seem
to like the story, exactly.

01:55:30.006 --> 01:55:34.512
But they thanked me, they
wished me well, and they left.

01:55:41.184 --> 01:55:43.357
So the stories...

01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:48.400
both the zebra
and the sailor...

01:55:48.859 --> 01:55:50.782
broke their leg.

01:55:51.194 --> 01:55:54.414
And the hyena killed the
zebra and the orangutan.

01:55:54.865 --> 01:55:58.870
So... the hyena is the cook.

01:55:59.202 --> 01:56:01.546
The sailor is the zebra.

01:56:01.872 --> 01:56:04.591
Your mother is the orangutan.

01:56:04.916 --> 01:56:08.045
And you are...

01:56:08.879 --> 01:56:11.302
the tiger.

01:56:15.302 --> 01:56:17.100
Can I ask you something?

01:56:18.597 --> 01:56:20.440
Of course.

01:56:20.599 --> 01:56:24.445
I've told you two stories about
what happened out on the ocean.

01:56:24.603 --> 01:56:27.903
Neither explains what caused
the sinking of the ship...

01:56:28.064 --> 01:56:32.240
and no one can prove which story
is true and which is not.

01:56:32.402 --> 01:56:35.747
In both stories,
the ship sinks...

01:56:35.906 --> 01:56:38.830
my family dies and I suffer.

01:56:39.284 --> 01:56:40.752
True.

01:56:43.288 --> 01:56:45.586
So, which story do you prefer?

01:56:53.089 --> 01:56:55.262
The one with the tiger.

01:56:56.259 --> 01:56:58.512
That's the better story.

01:57:01.848 --> 01:57:03.600
Thank you.

01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:06.607
And so it goes with God.

01:57:18.323 --> 01:57:20.166
Mamaji was right.

01:57:21.159 --> 01:57:23.457
It's an amazing story.

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:26.794
Will you really
let me write it?

01:57:26.957 --> 01:57:28.379
Of course.

01:57:28.542 --> 01:57:31.796
Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?

01:57:35.799 --> 01:57:37.392
My wife is here.

01:57:37.551 --> 01:57:39.792
Do you want to stay for dinner?
She's an incredible cook.

01:57:39.803 --> 01:57:40.975
I didn't know you had a wife.

01:57:41.137 --> 01:57:43.356
And a cat and two children.

01:57:43.974 --> 01:57:46.352
So, your story does
have a happy ending.

01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:49.484
Well, that's up to you.

01:57:49.813 --> 01:57:52.157
The story is yours now.

01:58:07.497 --> 01:58:08.544
Hmm.

01:58:09.541 --> 01:58:13.762
"Mr. Patel's is an astounding
story of courage and endurance...

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.890
unparalleled in the
history of shipwrecks."

01:58:17.048 --> 01:58:21.349
"Very few castaways can claim to
have survived so long at sea...

01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:24.060
and none in the company...

01:58:24.222 --> 01:58:26.896
of an adult Bengal tiger."

01:58:29.352 --> 01:58:30.649
Hi, Dad.

01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:33.740
We have a guest.
Let me introduce you.

01:58:34.608 --> 01:58:35.734
Hi.
Hi.

01:58:36.026 --> 01:58:37.278
Nice to meet you.

01:58:37.444 --> 01:58:38.696
Adita.

01:58:39.696 --> 01:58:40.913
Ravi.
