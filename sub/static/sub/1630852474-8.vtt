00:02.000 --> 00:04.440
I'll see you all back here no later
than one o'clock, Christmas Eve.

00:04.440 --> 00:05.520
Yeah.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.880
Someone tried to kill you? Yes.No!

00:07.880 --> 00:10.440
It was a misunderstanding.
He's actually an old friend.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.040
I'll sort it out when I get back.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.520
Man to man.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.680
Mr Bellamy, that is
a court warrant for debt.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.640
Reports exaggerate.
All alive. They're alive!

00:19.640 --> 00:21.440
And heading for New York!

00:21.440 --> 00:22.760
CHEERING

00:22.760 --> 00:24.080
You are very loyal to this man.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.680
Every time I saw Bellamy at the
Reform Club, he was humiliating you!

00:27.680 --> 00:30.320
I can't take a Winchester
into the Reform Club, can I?

00:30.320 --> 00:31.880
Can I?

00:31.880 --> 00:34.320
Where did this come from, Grayson?
There's no postmark.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.240
Abandoning Estella like that is
the thing that I'm most ashamed of

00:37.240 --> 00:38.680
and that I most regret.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.640
She travelled and lived her life,
and I never saw her again.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.800
I did nothing with my life.
That's not true.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.600

01:14.800 --> 01:16.920
Well...
Oddly exhilarating, actually.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.320
Loved your new piece on India,
Miss Fix.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.680
None of us at the paper have ever
read anything quite like it.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.120
Thank you.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.400
What next? I understand you once
said you need a man like

01:34.520 --> 01:36.440
And you, Passepartout?

01:36.440 --> 01:39.200
I am a rolling stone, monsieur.
I will roll.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.560
You really...?

01:40.560 --> 01:43.360
Is it true that everyone in
the city knows I'm here?

01:43.360 --> 01:46.080
There's not a man or woman on the
island of Manhattan who doesn't know

01:46.080 --> 01:49.360
that the great Phileas Fogg is going
to be in this very station today.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.520
Now, we'd love to stand here talking
with you all day,

Why wouldn't it be?

02:48.160 --> 02:51.800
There she is. The Henrietta.
We've almost made it.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.320
Don't look back, monsieur.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.360
Let's go home.
Safe travels, folks.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.240
Good morning, ladies and gentleman.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.040
Welcome aboard Henrietta,
to our grand ballroom.

03:14.040 --> 03:18.160
Well, this is pretty spectacular!
I suppose it will have to do.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.560

Mr Fogg?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.600

it's all getting a bit much for him.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.080
I think you might be right,
Passepartout.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.360
Well, someone will achieve this.
Well, it won't be you.

and that I most regret,

04:19.160 --> 04:22.400
and I've never felt that same close
bond with anyone again.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.840
There's some who are born
to adventure

04:24.840 --> 04:28.240
and others, frankly, are not.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.400
I'll see you all back here, no later

has no purpose.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.720
You will do whatever it takes to
hold on to it, and if you do not,

04:45.720 --> 04:48.120
then, THEN you're a coward.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.760
You've changed your mind, excellent!

04:57.760 --> 04:59.640
May I recommend this Darjeeling tea?

04:59.640 --> 05:01.360
I'm going ashore.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.360
Ashore?
But it's nearly time to set sail.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.800
You are so close, monsieur.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.840
If I'm not back in time,
just leave without me.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.120
Mr Fogg? What's happening?
Where's he going?

05:10.120 --> 05:13.920
Where do you think? To stand under
a clock and wait for a woman.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.800
BELL CHIMES

06:36.280 --> 06:38.120
I can't believe it.

06:43.120 --> 06:46.520
to be this close
and to throw it all away.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.800
He'll make it back,
I know he will.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.520
Mr Fogg won't let us down.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.360
Mr Fogg lets everyone down.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.400
Come on, that's not fair.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.720
He's not the same man we started out
with, you know that as well as I.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.960
You mean the man who sat
in the same chair

07:02.960 --> 07:05.600
waiting for something
to happen for 20 years?

How dare you leave me on that ship

08:25.520 --> 08:28.400
without so much as
a word or a backward glance!

08:31.680 --> 08:33.560
You broke my heart.

08:35.160 --> 08:37.760
I know what I did,
Estella, I ruined your life.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.720
I won't ask for your forgiveness
because what I did was unforgivable.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.160
But if it's any consolation,
I ruined mine at the same time.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.720
Do you have time for me to tell you
how terrible my life has been?

08:53.280 --> 08:55.360
All the time in the world.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.720
SHIP'S HORN BLARES

09:03.760 --> 09:05.440
Go inside. He's not coming.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.440
What if this was how it was meant
to end for Mr Fogg?

09:10.440 --> 09:14.760
Not back in the Reform Club,
but in the arms of his lover?

09:14.760 --> 09:16.280
His lover?

09:16.280 --> 09:17.640
A woman he left on a ship

09:17.640 --> 09:19.760
because he didn't have the courage
to be with her.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.720
What if this is simply
the most gigantic,

09:23.720 --> 09:26.040
astonishing love story?

09:26.040 --> 09:28.720
It's just not the story we thought
it was.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.640
And what if he's using this
as an excuse?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.080
A fear of winning,

09:34.080 --> 09:36.480
a fear of facing that man
waiting for him in London?

09:36.480 --> 09:39.680
You forget how he looked at me in
India when he thought I was Estella.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.440
That was no excuse.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.520
I hope one day a man will look at me
like that.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.520
You've changed your melody.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.200
Tune.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.800
I've let my experiences influence
and modify what I believe.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.240
You should try it. Oh!

09:56.240 --> 09:58.160
I'm sure your father will arrange

09:58.160 --> 10:00.920
everything exactly the way
you want it.

10:00.920 --> 10:05.200
Uh, what do you mean by that?
Nothing. Forget I said anything.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.600
Come on, this journey
is nearly over,

10:07.600 --> 10:09.720
you might as well
say what you think.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.480
When you were asked at the station,
"What will you do next?"

10:12.480 --> 10:14.040
I had to smile to myself.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.080
Did you? And what was the source
of this hilarity?

10:16.080 --> 10:18.040
Your future is already waiting
for you.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.000
Your father will let you write
some articles,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.120
then you will meet some man
with a lot of money,

10:23.120 --> 10:24.720
lovely house, servants, babies...

10:24.720 --> 10:26.760
After all this time,
all we've been through,

10:26.760 --> 10:29.480
you actually know nothing about me,
do you? Not a single thing.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.240
It has nothing to do with me.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.720
But I know something about you,
Monsieur Passepartout.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.720
I know that deep,
deep down you want a home,

10:36.720 --> 10:39.480
you want somewhere to belong,
you want people to love

10:39.480 --> 10:41.280
and you want people
to love you back.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.840
Don't hold your breath, Miss Fix.
Me?

10:43.840 --> 10:46.520
I want nothing to do
with your squalid little life.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.920
What extraordinary vanity
to think that I might.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.200
Well, then we're both happy!
Delirious. Yes!

10:53.520 --> 10:56.160
Once it became clear that you
weren't going to follow me,

10:56.160 --> 10:59.400
I just travelled,
like we always said we would.

10:59.400 --> 11:03.640
I saw the world. It's a rather
beautiful world, Phileas.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.120
Yes, it is. I know that now.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.680
And then I ended up here in
New York, pretty much penniless,

11:10.680 --> 11:14.600
so I started working in the kitchens
of an Italian restaurant...

11:14.600 --> 11:19.840
..where I met the owner's son,
Fabio Rossi. He made me laugh again.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.720
One day, he asked me to marry him
and I said yes.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.240
You're married. I'm glad.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.440
Fabio died four months ago.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.840
Estella, I'm so sorry.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.120
Please tell me about him.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.840
Fabio was charming.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.360
He was funny, passionate,
infuriating.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.720
Always the light and soul
of any room he'd ever walk into.

11:45.720 --> 11:49.400
I didn't know what he was going to
do or say from one hour to another.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.760
He was a wonderful father.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.680
And the most beautiful husband,
and...I loved him.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.680
You've had a good life?
Oh, I've had a life.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.040
Some of it was astonishing,
some of it was sad.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.480
But day and night, sun and rain,
it all makes up a life.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.880
And you, Phileas,
what have you done with yours?

12:16.880 --> 12:19.560
Nothing. Nothing?

12:19.560 --> 12:22.040
After my act of cowardice at
Dover that morning...

12:22.040 --> 12:24.680
Enough of that.
..I went to the Reform Club,

12:24.680 --> 12:27.080
I sat in my usual chair,
talked to my usual friends,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.720
had lunch at my usual table

12:28.720 --> 12:31.520
and read about the cricket scores
in the Telegraph.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.480
You were seeing the world and
falling in love and having a family,

12:34.480 --> 12:37.280
and I was reading about
a sticky wicket at the Oval.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.280
For 20 years.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.800
I knew it!

12:46.920 --> 12:50.920
The day we buried my husband,
this man who had loved life so much

12:50.920 --> 12:53.520
and who had shared it with me,
I thought about you, Phileas.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.480
A very different sort of man.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.280
Potentially brilliant...

12:57.280 --> 12:58.680
..but frightened of life.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So I sent you a postcard.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.520
You really should get
on board, miss.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.040
I'm waiting for a friend.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.320
He's got 20 minutes.
The Henrietta waits for no-one.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.920
You were under a lot of pressure,
I knew that,

13:24.920 --> 13:27.480
especially from your
so-called friends.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.680
My friends? I suspect Fortescue
was terribly fair.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.840
"On the one hand, on the other
hand..."Yes, he was, yes.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.040
But your delightful Bellamy
less so.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.840
Bellamy. You remember him?

13:38.840 --> 13:40.880
Of course I do.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.960
The night before we were to leave
for France, he came to see me.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.240
He told me what an utterly useless
man you were

13:46.240 --> 13:49.280
and how you'd never have the courage
to come on the journey with me,

13:49.280 --> 13:51.520
and that I should cut my losses
while I still could.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.560
I told him he was just
jealous of you

13:53.560 --> 13:56.440
and you were a thousand times
the man he'd ever be.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.200
But he was right and you were wrong.
I don't believe that.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.960
I didn't believe it then
and I don't believe it now.

14:07.240 --> 14:10.280
Oh, you must go,
you'll...miss your sailing.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.680
What sort of a life...

14:15.680 --> 14:18.440
..do you think that we
would have had together

14:18.440 --> 14:20.680
if I'd had the courage
to get back on that ship?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.960
I think we would have had
a wonderful life.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.720
I always thought we'd travel
the world together

14:28.720 --> 14:31.560
and then we'd settle down in
a little cottage somewhere in Devon,

14:31.560 --> 14:33.640
away from London
and all your friends.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.320
Really? You thought that?

14:38.880 --> 14:42.600
And you...think that we might
have had children?

14:42.600 --> 14:45.200
Oh, of course. We'd
have had brilliant children.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.720
And you would have been
a brilliant father.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.640
Phileas...

14:52.640 --> 14:54.240
Phileas.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.600
One tiny step, one shard of courage,

14:57.600 --> 15:00.080
and we would have had
a life together.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.240
It's not too late, Phileas.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.920
Well, it's too late for you and I,
obviously, though.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.240
That ship sailed years ago
from Dover.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.040
Yes, obviously.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.920
But it's not too late for you,
Phileas.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.400
You are an extraordinary man

15:14.400 --> 15:17.840
who was put on this Earth
to do extraordinary things.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.680
That's what you said when we met.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.360
You've only just begun,
you haven't finished yet.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.640
The biggest obstacle
is still waiting for you.

15:28.640 --> 15:32.120
Just one more sailing to Liverpool,
one last train journey.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.560
That's nothing to me now. Oh...

15:34.560 --> 15:36.720
Boats and trains are all that,

15:36.720 --> 15:41.360
but the likes of men like Bellamy,
well, it's a different story.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.160
He will try and bring you down,

15:44.160 --> 15:46.520
he will try and humiliate you,

15:46.520 --> 15:49.720
pin you to that wretched armchair
for the rest of your life.

15:49.720 --> 15:53.880
If you let him win,
he wins for ever.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.520
Do you understand?

15:59.320 --> 16:01.680
He was wrong and you were right.
Exactly!

16:04.240 --> 16:06.400
I loved you, Estella.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.640
Never, never doubt that.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.800
I never have.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.160
Forgive me!

16:34.920 --> 16:37.200
Final call for the Henrietta.

16:42.680 --> 16:47.760
I'm sorry. I was upset about Mr Fogg
leaving us and I took it out on you.

16:49.640 --> 16:53.560
Because you really want us to finish
this together, don't you?

16:53.560 --> 16:56.920
I've let my experiences influence
and change what I believe.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.560
I didn't want it to end like this.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.960
Not the story you were hoping
to write.

17:13.560 --> 17:17.000
You sat there in front of me,
sir, in that very chair,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.960
and assured me that this
bank's loan to you would be covered

17:19.960 --> 17:23.840
by you coming into a considerable
amount of money this Christmas Eve.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.400
That is correct.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.480
A wager?! A bet?!

17:27.480 --> 17:32.040
What is all investment banking,
Mr Hughes, if not a form of betting?

17:32.040 --> 17:34.400
Now, if there's nothing else...

17:34.400 --> 17:38.600
You sound very confident that your
friend will fail in this endeavour.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.800
Supremely confident.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.680
Cab!

17:47.360 --> 17:48.760
Cab?

17:48.760 --> 17:51.080
I already got a lady in the back,
mister.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.280
Cab? Cab? Sorry, my friend, no.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.320
He's not going to make it.
He's still got time.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.040
MAN SHOUTS

18:13.280 --> 18:14.600
Agh!

18:14.600 --> 18:16.760
Get off me! I have a boat to catch!
No, you don't.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.160
Your journey ends here.
Get in there.What are you doing?!

18:20.160 --> 18:21.960
It's Bellamy, isn't it?

18:21.960 --> 18:23.920
Is this so he can win
a stupid wager?

18:23.920 --> 18:26.840
A bit more than that, I'm afraid.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.920
The man's bankrupt.Bankrupt?

18:31.840 --> 18:35.560
Maybe he said to slow me down.
Not this. He's my friend.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.520
What's happening over here?

18:37.520 --> 18:39.960
This is our bit of town.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.520
What are you doing
with the rich man?

18:43.520 --> 18:46.240
This is private business, boys,
on your way.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.320
I said, on your way, child.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.680
It's Christmas. You've got to share.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.960
Come on. Let's leave the elves
to their play.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.480
"Phileas Fogg's epic adventure
ended in a New York warehouse."

19:08.480 --> 19:11.120
Sounds rather glamorous.
It's not, though.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.560
Hey, Scrooges!

19:12.560 --> 19:15.120
HE CHUCKLES

19:15.120 --> 19:17.280
You silly, silly boys.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.600
Give us the man's wallet
and you can go.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.720
That's not going to happen.

19:25.400 --> 19:29.560
Keep the rich one out the way till
we're finish with his friend.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.480
This way, sir.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.760
Hold him!

19:46.240 --> 19:48.000
Oh! Agh!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.400
You think you're tough?!

19:50.400 --> 19:53.560
Have you ever spent even a term

19:53.560 --> 19:56.120
at an English public school?!

19:56.120 --> 19:58.240
THEY GROAN

20:06.120 --> 20:08.160
I said 80 days

20:08.160 --> 20:10.560
and I meant 80 days!

20:20.200 --> 20:22.800
GANG MEMBERS GROAN

20:30.000 --> 20:33.320
Yes. Let's go, boys.
Yes! Run home to your mothers!

20:33.320 --> 20:37.040
Come on, let's go.
I am Phileas Fogg!

20:37.040 --> 20:39.480
Go, lads!Ha!

20:45.080 --> 20:47.760
I'll get a doctor.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.560
It's too late for me.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.240
HE GROANS

20:56.520 --> 20:58.480
What's this?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.560
HE EXHALES SOFTLY

21:08.200 --> 21:10.920
SHIP'S HORN BLARES

21:10.920 --> 21:14.000
You either get on now
or stay here, miss.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.400
And so it ends.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.240
Come, Miss Fix.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.720
What on earth are you doing
hanging around here?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.680
Mr Fogg! What happened to you?

21:28.680 --> 21:31.880
I met a woman under a clock.
I'm sorry if I alarmed you both.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.280
We started this together,
we will finish it together.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.640
Home?

21:35.640 --> 21:37.280
Home. Home.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.000
Fogg!

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
May the best man win!

22:30.000 --> 22:31.960
HE LAUGHS

22:43.920 --> 22:46.480
Everyone downstairs
is willing him on, sir.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.480
Oh, thank you, Roberts.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.960
No telegrams for me? No, sir.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.280
Getting a bit jittery there,
Bellamy?

22:57.280 --> 22:59.320
Not in the slightest.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.760
Phileas Fogg against the world.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.600
There was only ever going to be
one winner.

23:09.600 --> 23:12.640
And it's not Fogg.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.600
Well, you'd better hope not.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.080
£20,000.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.720
Full steam ahead!

24:01.360 --> 24:05.000
I hope you're not writing
about Mr Fogg's liaison?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.680
How can you even suggest
such a thing?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.520
How many Ts in Estella?

24:09.520 --> 24:12.120
Garcon. More ice over here.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.640
Uh, I think monsieur may have
mistaken me for a waiter,

24:17.640 --> 24:19.760
when I am in fact
a fellow traveller.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.160
HE SCOFFS

24:19.760 --> 24:22.160
But this is first class.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.880
He has a first-class ticket,
you imbecile.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.200
Don't call my fiance an imbecile.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.880
You are the one who's letting
the side down.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.160
If you're going to be in
first class with us,

24:32.160 --> 24:34.880
you'd better scrub that dirt
off your skin.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.040
Ignore them, Passepartout.
It's just ignorance.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.760
I know what it is, Miss Fix.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.280
And, uh, don't tell me how
to deal with it.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.920
I've been dealing
with it all my life.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

25:00.760 --> 25:03.720
Would you care to dance with me,
Miss Fix?

25:09.880 --> 25:13.040
I've had enough of this.
Ah-ah! Leave it.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.600
They're not worth it.

Ah...!

26:11.480 --> 26:15.000
Go to bed. I don't want to
look at it any more.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.760
Agatha.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.520
Not tonight.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.800
They can't change tonight.

SHIP'S HORN BLOWS

28:11.240 --> 28:14.840
Welcome to Liverpool,
ladies and gentlemen...

28:14.840 --> 28:17.640
There's a direct train
to St Pancras Station

28:17.640 --> 28:20.560
that's due to get into
London at 11.30am.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.120
If we jump in a cab there,
we'll be back at the Reform Club

28:23.120 --> 28:25.800
and trailing clouds of glory and
still have half an hour to spare.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.600
You're in a good mood, monsieur.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.000
We're in England,
I can smell the finishing line.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
One more train, and victory is ours.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.320
Aha!

28:33.320 --> 28:35.920
Good day to you, sir. Phileas Fogg,
you may have heard of me.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.240
In something of a hurry.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.560
Papers.Yes.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.240
We have travelled around
the world in

28:45.240 --> 28:47.240
very nearly 80 days,

28:47.240 --> 28:49.520
and the train to London
is our last leg.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.960
It leaves within the hour.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.760
Passepartout.
You're free to go through.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.000
Miss Abigail Fortescue.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.880
Welcome home, Miss Fortescue.
Thank you.

29:02.960 --> 29:06.480
Fogg. Phileas.
That's you, sir, is it?

29:06.480 --> 29:08.600
It is, yes.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.960
Yes. If you could just let us get
on, I'd be incredibly obliged...

29:11.960 --> 29:15.640
It says here, sir, there's an
outstanding warrant for your arrest.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.560
For my arr...?
That's pr-preposterous.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.840
An arrest warrant from where?
Hong Kong.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.600
That was a misunderstanding.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.800
I'm sure it was, miss.
Still, there it is.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.720
An outstanding warrant of arrest.
Yes. Yes. Send a telegram to

29:27.720 --> 29:30.600
the governor's office in Hong Kong,
they'll explain everything.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.640
It's not my job to send telegrams.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.360
This is ridiculous. I have
circumnavigated the world and...

29:35.360 --> 29:37.400
Who does send the telegrams,
Officer?

29:37.400 --> 29:40.200
Barry.
And where might we find Barry?

29:40.200 --> 29:41.800
In his bed, I should think.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.000
When does he start work? 8am.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.800
That's too late. We'd miss
the train, we'd lose the wager.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.240
You should have thought about that

29:48.240 --> 29:50.080
before you got yourself arrested,
sir.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.000
What is wrong with this stupid
country?! This man is a hero.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.160
This stupid country will happily
deport you, sir,

29:55.160 --> 29:57.480
if you don't calm down. Next!

29:57.480 --> 29:59.880
My father is the editor
of the Daily Telegraph.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.320
That's nice for him, miss.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.680
Stand aside, sir,

30:02.680 --> 30:05.160
you're making these people late
for their connections.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.480
We are on the cusp of history,
Officer.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.560
You could be a small
but glorious part of it.

30:10.560 --> 30:13.400
Lucky old me, sir. Stand aside.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.400
No. I will not fail.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.840
Next!

30:20.840 --> 30:22.320
Mr Fogg!

30:36.920 --> 30:38.400
Get off him!

30:38.400 --> 30:39.840
80 days...

30:39.840 --> 30:41.880
Calm down. Get him up.80 days...
Come on.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.800
In you go, sir.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.440
DOOR LOCKS

31:00.640 --> 31:03.560
Yeah, I'll be gone by five,
so that's three hours this week.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.360
Thanks for noting that, sir.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.480
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

31:07.480 --> 31:10.680
Before you ask, nothing has changed
since the last time you asked me.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.640
Why is our friend still
incarcerated? It's outrageous.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.800
Barry says the line
to Hong Kong is still down.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.240
When the line is up,
Barry will make his enquiries.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.840
When will that be?
All in good time.

31:22.840 --> 31:26.160
We don't have time.
That is what we keep telling you.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.240
If you two don't stop harassing me,
you'll both have your own cells -

31:29.240 --> 31:32.160
and that's no way
to spend Christmas.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.240
It's nearly over.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.680
We've failed.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.160
WATCH SNAPS SHUT

32:16.440 --> 32:19.160
MEN CHATTER

32:24.720 --> 32:27.320
Poor Mr Fogg.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.120
This will devastate him.

32:30.160 --> 32:34.160
Merry Christmas,
British bureaucracy.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.600
Where will you spend Christmas?

32:40.640 --> 32:43.360
You don't have to worry about me
any more.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.760
What if I want to worry about you?

32:47.440 --> 32:50.200
Your life is waiting for you,
Miss Fix.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.120
Your father, an important career.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.960
Are you saying that if you were
to stay in London,

33:03.960 --> 33:06.760
our friendship would be some sort
of brake on my career,

33:06.760 --> 33:08.600
my happiness?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.880
So on you'll roll,
the great Passepartout,

33:10.880 --> 33:12.960
nobly leaving me behind to my fate?

33:12.960 --> 33:15.400
What if this courageous, selfless,
noble act of yours

33:15.400 --> 33:17.280
isn't courageous at all?

33:17.280 --> 33:19.480
What if it's cowardice?

33:19.480 --> 33:21.520
What if you're frightened of
caring for someone

33:21.520 --> 33:24.280
because if you care for someone,
you might just get hurt?

33:25.480 --> 33:29.560
I think that what we had can only
truly make sense

33:29.560 --> 33:32.560
in the middle of
this great adventure.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.040
Then we must find another adventure.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.800
I don't know what
the future holds, nobody does.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.200
Promise me one thing, Passepartout.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.240
Don't try and be noble.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.560
Don't slip away and think you'll be
making my life easier.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.120
Promise me that.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.480
Passepartout?

33:57.520 --> 33:59.120
I promise.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.280
# And all the bells on Earth
shall ring

34:08.280 --> 34:11.680
# On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day

34:11.680 --> 34:15.120
# And all the bells on Earth
shall ring

34:15.120 --> 34:18.400
# On Christmas Day

34:18.400 --> 34:27.960
# In the morning... #

34:27.960 --> 34:30.440
Sorry about the delay, sir.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.280
It wasn't Barry's fault.
The line to Hong Kong was down.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.040
Mm. You're free to go.

34:36.040 --> 34:42.040
# ..I saw three ships
come sailing in

34:42.040 --> 34:46.520
# On Christmas Day in the morning. #

34:46.520 --> 34:49.880
I did know who you were,
Mr Fogg, but I have a job to do,

34:49.880 --> 34:52.360
I'm sure you understand.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.840
It was always going to end this way.

34:56.280 --> 34:59.360
Foolish to think otherwise.
Merry Christmas.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.320
Merry Christmas, sir.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.240
How are you, monsieur?

35:23.240 --> 35:24.840
Looking forward to getting home.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.120
It wasn't your fault. It was...
No.

35:27.120 --> 35:31.040
I'd rather not talk about it,
Miss Fix, if you don't mind.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.240
I think this time
we are finally finished.

35:36.680 --> 35:40.040
You... You nearly made it.
No-one could have done more.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.720
He's not right about much,
but he's right about this.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.640
It was the most astonishing attempt.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.880
You're both very kind.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.440
I wonder if there's
a dining car on the train.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.400
DOORBELL RINGS

36:02.920 --> 36:04.440
RINGING CONTINUES

36:04.440 --> 36:06.960
I'm coming, I'm coming.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.600
Mr Fogg!

36:14.600 --> 36:18.400
Sorry, Grayson,
lost my key somewhere over Italy.

36:18.400 --> 36:22.000
You're home! Come in, come in!

36:23.400 --> 36:26.920
Hello, Grayson.You know Miss Fix.
And Passepartout. Bonjour, Grayson.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.440
Yes, of course.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.920
We've read all about your adventures
in the Telegraph.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.160
We're all very proud of you here,
sir.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.120
Thank you, Grayson.

36:39.200 --> 36:44.080
I don't know about anyone else,
but I'm ready for a glass of sherry.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.440
Aren't you cutting it a bit fine,
sir?

36:48.440 --> 36:50.320
Cutting what a bit fine?

36:50.320 --> 36:52.960
Well, if you're to win the wager,
you have to be

36:52.960 --> 36:54.720
at the Reform Club...

36:56.720 --> 36:58.600
..in 15 minutes.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.840
My dear fellow,
we have lost the wager.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.640
We had to be back in London
by one o'clock on Christmas Eve.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.200
Today is Christmas Day.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.200
GRAYSON SCOFFS

37:08.200 --> 37:12.840
I'm sorry, sir, but today
is not Christmas Day.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.920
How about that glass of sherry?
There's a good chap.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.200
I think I can see what's happened,
it's an easy mistake to make.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.240
You were travelling constantly
eastwards,

37:22.240 --> 37:25.360
which means you were constantly
travelling towards the sun,

37:25.360 --> 37:29.200
and the days were therefore
diminished by four minutes.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.120
The circumference of the Earth
is 360 degrees.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.720
Those 360 degrees multiplied
by four minutes

37:37.720 --> 37:41.400
gives precisely 24 hours.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.080
In other words, Grayson,
while we, travelling eastward,

37:44.080 --> 37:46.640
saw the sun pass
the meridian 80 times,

37:46.640 --> 37:51.520
you here in London only saw it
pass the meridian...

37:53.200 --> 37:55.000
..79 times?

37:56.880 --> 37:58.400
Precisely, sir.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.680
It's Christmas Eve.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.880
CHATTER

38:29.880 --> 38:34.160
Well, I hate to say I told you so,
Fortescue,

38:34.160 --> 38:36.920
but I told you so.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.680
He still has time.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.680
HE CHUCKLES

38:48.360 --> 38:51.440
It's Mr Fogg, sir. He's coming!
He's coming! He's coming!

38:51.440 --> 38:53.840
Come on, Phileas! Come on!

38:57.800 --> 38:59.960

39:03.480 --> 39:07.000
Where is he, then? He's stopped.
Stopped?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.080
But why has he stopped?

39:11.280 --> 39:13.600
SHOUTING AND CHEERING

39:16.120 --> 39:17.720
Mr Fogg!

39:27.240 --> 39:31.120
If he wins, you lose, Phileas,
for ever.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.640
That's what Estella said.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.960
And she was right.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.840
She was right all along.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.800
CROWD CHEERS

39:42.720 --> 39:44.760
He's on his way! Here he is!

39:48.160 --> 39:49.960

39:51.040 --> 39:52.920
..eight...

39:54.800 --> 39:56.360

39:58.360 --> 39:59.640

40:52.480 --> 40:54.360
You did it, Phileas.

40:54.360 --> 40:57.280
You actually did it.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.760
Never in doubt, Bernard.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.080
Not with your remarkable daughter
at my side.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.760
Abigail.

41:13.560 --> 41:16.440
I am so proud of you.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.480
Like I used to be proud of you,
Father.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.040
You foolish, foolish man.

41:32.440 --> 41:35.320
Jolly good show, old boy.
Welcome back.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.720
Father, there's someone I'd like you
to meet.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.920
Passepartout?

41:50.400 --> 41:52.200
Passepartout?

42:14.280 --> 42:18.960
Well done, Foggy. The best man won.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.560
Let's see the colour
of your money, Bellamy.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.440
LAUGHTER

42:23.440 --> 42:25.400
Shall we tell them now, old fellow?

42:25.400 --> 42:27.360
Tell us what?

42:27.360 --> 42:30.640
We were never doing it
for the money.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.640
We're not vulgarians.

42:32.640 --> 42:35.480
We just said that to rile
all you fellows up,

42:35.480 --> 42:37.640
and it seems it works,
you've swallowed it all

42:37.640 --> 42:40.320
hook, line and sinker,
haven't they, Phileas?

42:42.040 --> 42:44.320
Agree with me or I'll destroy you.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.800
Is this true, Phileas?
Was there never any money involved?

42:51.440 --> 42:53.680
I knew I was ill-equipped
to make this journey.

42:53.680 --> 42:55.560
You made that quite clear, Bellamy.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.000
Oh, that was just fun. Just banter!

42:58.000 --> 43:01.440
I even knew there was a chance
I wouldn't come back at all.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.000
The thought of Bellamy not getting

43:03.000 --> 43:05.240
the money that he won
fair and square,

43:05.240 --> 43:06.880
I couldn't abide it.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.800
So the day I left for France,
I ordered my man Grayson

43:09.800 --> 43:12.120
to bring a cheque to the club.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.920
So there was a bet for money?

43:13.920 --> 43:15.960
I think Mr Fogg is mistaken -

43:15.960 --> 43:19.080
unless he is trying to manipulate
the situation

43:19.080 --> 43:23.880
for his own financial gain,
which I, for one, refuse to believe.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.600
Mr Roberts, if you please.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.840
Sir?

43:26.840 --> 43:29.400
Tell the gentlemen what happened
that night.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.480
The night Mr Fogg left,

43:31.480 --> 43:34.960
his servant came to the club
and gave me this.

43:38.360 --> 43:43.760
It's...it's a cheque, made
payable to Bellamy for £20,000.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.200
MEN MURMUR

43:45.200 --> 43:47.600
He said I was to keep it until
Christmas Eve,

43:47.600 --> 43:49.120
and if Mr Fogg wasn't back by then,

43:49.120 --> 43:51.400
I was to give the cheque
to Mr Bellamy.

43:51.400 --> 43:54.880
This is the most outrageous
accusation. I have a mind to...

43:56.680 --> 43:58.560
This will cover your bankruptcy.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.000
Bankrupt?!

44:00.000 --> 44:03.600
You made a wager without
having the funds to cover it?

44:03.600 --> 44:07.720
He can't accept it,
Phileas, or he'll lose all honour.

44:07.720 --> 44:10.280
He can't lose what he never had.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
MEN MURMUR

44:20.000 --> 44:24.080
You really are the most tremendous
fellow, Foggy.

44:24.080 --> 44:27.120
For God's sake, go, Bellamy.

44:27.120 --> 44:29.240
You shame us all.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.600
Merry Christmas, gentlemen.

44:36.240 --> 44:39.440
Your final bar bill, Mr Bellamy.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.400
HE CHUCKLES

MEN SHOUT

44:47.840 --> 44:49.360
Get out.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.800
Miss Fix, in here.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.840
Passepartout. I can't find him.

45:10.840 --> 45:13.160
Passepartout?
He was here but...

45:13.160 --> 45:15.400
He promised me he wouldn't
run away.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.360
He's right there, beside you.

45:18.880 --> 45:22.480
I think it's time for
a little tipple.

45:22.480 --> 45:24.640
Miss Fix.

45:26.040 --> 45:28.760
You were beside me all the time?

45:30.360 --> 45:32.520
Always, Abigail.

45:34.040 --> 45:36.120
KNOCKING ON DOOR

45:38.800 --> 45:42.680
What shall we have, Abigail? Jean?

45:42.680 --> 45:45.520
Brandy? Why not? Perfect.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.840
KNOCKING CONTINUES

45:49.840 --> 45:52.640
Come on! Open the door, old chap!

45:55.320 --> 45:57.120
Thank you.Oh...

46:00.440 --> 46:01.960
Allow me, sir.

46:01.960 --> 46:03.400
SHE LAUGHS

46:03.400 --> 46:05.640
Very good, sir. Thank you.

46:05.640 --> 46:07.040
To friendship.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.120
To friendship. To friendship.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.280
I can't believe I mislaid
an entire day.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.200
Open the door!

46:26.320 --> 46:29.320
I'll never forget you,
either of you.

46:29.320 --> 46:32.000
It was a great adventure, monsieur.
The greatest.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.120
The greatest.

46:34.120 --> 46:37.600
CHANTING: Fogg! Fogg! Fogg! Fogg!
Fogg!

46:37.600 --> 46:40.080
Look, something has been
attacking shipping

46:40.080 --> 46:41.920
and causing all sorts of bother.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.640
The British think it might be
a giant narwhal.What nonsense.

46:44.640 --> 46:46.520
A narwhal's a porpoise,
for goodness' sake.

46:46.520 --> 46:48.160
That couldn't sink a pint of beer.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.000
The Americans think
it's a giant squid.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.120
Ha! And the French think it's some
sort of mechanical war machine.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.680
Then that is what it will be.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.160
No government could build
a submarine that powerful

46:57.160 --> 46:59.560
without every other government
in the world knowing.

46:59.560 --> 47:01.120
It sounds interesting, though.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.040
Where's this supposed to be
happening?

47:03.040 --> 47:06.600
MEN OUTSIDE:
# For he's a jolly good fellow

47:06.600 --> 47:09.840
# For he's a jolly good fellow

47:09.840 --> 47:12.560
# And so say all of us! #

47:12.560 --> 47:15.120
Here, here! Where is he?

47:17.680 --> 47:19.040
Abigail!

47:20.480 --> 47:23.720
THEY LAUGH
