00:04.035 --> 00:05.121
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

00:05.170 --> 00:06.363
- Bailey.
- Jason.

00:06.412 --> 00:08.260
- I'm John Nolan. And you are?
- Her husband.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.480
I'm trying to protect this city.

00:09.529 --> 00:11.689
So you think putting
a 16-year-old into juvie

00:11.738 --> 00:13.759
is gonna turn the tide
in the war on drugs?

00:13.807 --> 00:16.295
I am in a good place. James is great.

00:16.343 --> 00:17.853
- What did you find out?
- Jason Wyler

00:17.902 --> 00:19.564
is the most charming man on the planet.

00:19.613 --> 00:21.233
<i>He whispers in all the right ears,</i>

00:21.281 --> 00:22.092
and whoever is his enemy,

00:22.140 --> 00:23.769
ends up on the wrong end of a shank.

00:23.817 --> 00:25.437
What is happening? Why am I...

00:25.485 --> 00:26.705
He's framing me.

00:26.754 --> 00:28.033
Hearing that she's finally

00:28.081 --> 00:29.261
facing some consequences,

00:29.310 --> 00:31.275
- it does well for my spirit.
- I know who you are now.

00:31.324 --> 00:32.982
And I'm coming for you.

00:33.598 --> 00:34.878
Let's talk about what's next.

00:34.926 --> 00:36.513
Well, it's pretty straightforward.

00:36.561 --> 00:38.548
You can go to trial, fight the charges,

00:38.596 --> 00:40.293
or take a plea.

00:40.342 --> 00:41.910
And if I fight and lose?

00:41.959 --> 00:43.900
Most likely, you'll do prison time.

00:44.757 --> 00:46.570
And if I take a plea?

00:46.686 --> 00:47.842
I feel confident,

00:47.890 --> 00:48.691
that we could get

00:48.739 --> 00:51.327
a mandatory treatment program
and probation.

00:51.375 --> 00:54.230
But I would still have
a drug charge on my record,

00:54.278 --> 00:55.567
and at minimum,

00:55.615 --> 00:57.066
I would be out of the Army Reserve

00:57.114 --> 01:00.637
and I'd probably be fired
from the LAFD.

01:01.210 --> 01:03.478
I would lose everything
that matters to me.

01:03.527 --> 01:05.251
Except for you.

01:06.345 --> 01:07.479
What?

01:07.528 --> 01:08.796
It's nothing.

01:08.942 --> 01:10.479
It's not nothing.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.020
And I can't take another round

01:12.068 --> 01:13.387
- of gaslighting right now.
- Okay, so,

01:13.435 --> 01:15.942
the Department frowns

01:16.100 --> 01:19.055
on officers fraternizing
with convicted felons.

01:19.103 --> 01:21.239
They can frown all they want.

01:21.288 --> 01:22.346
They can't fire me.

01:22.395 --> 01:24.694
Everyone who's important
knows you're innocent.

01:24.742 --> 01:27.544
But just dating me would hold you back.

01:28.846 --> 01:30.082
I gotta give it to Jason...

01:30.131 --> 01:32.199
he really planned this perfectly.

01:32.567 --> 01:34.759
You know, there is still
a third option.

01:35.364 --> 01:38.366
We prove your innocence
and we take him down.

01:42.738 --> 01:44.264
Morning.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.901
Um...

01:47.524 --> 01:48.985
What were you doing up all night?

01:49.033 --> 01:50.627
Legal research.

01:50.705 --> 01:52.057
Researching what?

01:52.155 --> 01:53.205
Do you remember that, uh,

01:53.253 --> 01:54.891
kid I was telling you about... Tyler?

01:54.939 --> 01:56.579
- Oh, the one who robbed the liquor store...
- Yes.

01:56.627 --> 01:58.728
and then gave the store owner
a heart attack,

01:58.846 --> 02:01.264
and the clown from the DA's
office blamed you for it?

02:01.460 --> 02:03.699
No, I don't remember that.

02:06.580 --> 02:07.870
Anyway, good news...

02:07.918 --> 02:09.638
um, the store owner
was released from the hospital.

02:09.686 --> 02:11.007
She's gonna be fine.

02:11.055 --> 02:13.176
Amazing. I bet Tyler's relieved.

02:13.224 --> 02:14.767
Yeah, but he's not
out of the woods yet.

02:14.816 --> 02:15.963
I have been up all night

02:16.012 --> 02:17.049
trying to research ways that

02:17.097 --> 02:18.681
the state can show him leniency.

02:18.729 --> 02:20.634
I've just got to convince that clown

02:20.898 --> 02:22.251
to charge him as a minor.

02:22.299 --> 02:24.775
Well, Tyler's lucky he
has you looking out for him.

02:24.824 --> 02:26.089
- Aww.
- I knew I was.

02:26.137 --> 02:27.457
Oh.

02:27.505 --> 02:28.622
I mean, not that long ago,

02:28.671 --> 02:30.642
I was on the streets,
as desperate as he was,

02:30.691 --> 02:33.748
and then I did the smartest
thing I think I've ever done...

02:33.796 --> 02:34.948
Steal your car.

02:34.997 --> 02:36.747
Okay. Agree to disagree.

02:36.796 --> 02:39.384
No, seriously. Crime totally pays.

02:39.483 --> 02:41.294
And Tyler's lucky to have you.

02:42.004 --> 02:43.093
You're cute!

02:43.142 --> 02:44.208
This is nice.

02:44.257 --> 02:46.780
Actually spending the night together.

02:46.951 --> 02:49.469
Doing couple things
in the morning before work.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.018
Yeah, who knew we had
to share custody schedules

02:52.067 --> 02:53.354
before we hooked up?

02:53.403 --> 02:55.716
I actually should get going though,
I gotta...

02:55.765 --> 02:56.872
I gotta do a thing.

02:56.951 --> 02:58.200
That sounds ominous.

02:58.414 --> 03:00.167
No, it's fine. I just have to have a,

03:00.216 --> 03:01.817
a talk with Curtis Jones.

03:01.912 --> 03:03.432
About Tyler.

03:03.512 --> 03:06.200
Wait. Is he still leaning
on Tyler's family for money?

03:06.303 --> 03:08.591
Yeah, and I-I need to convince Curtis

03:08.639 --> 03:10.626
to cut his losses and let it go.

03:10.674 --> 03:12.261
Okay, well, I'm coming with you.

03:12.309 --> 03:14.797
- No.
- Yes, I'm...

03:14.845 --> 03:16.099
Nyla, no.

03:16.294 --> 03:17.755
No, you can't be there. Look, if,

03:17.803 --> 03:19.247
if word gets out that a cop

03:19.295 --> 03:20.884
is hovering on my shoulder,

03:21.119 --> 03:22.973
they'll stop trusting me.

03:23.997 --> 03:26.068
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but you're dating a cop,

03:26.116 --> 03:27.253
so that's gonna get around.

03:27.302 --> 03:30.112
I know, which means
I have to work extra hard

03:30.161 --> 03:31.907
to stay independent.

03:32.119 --> 03:34.117
Look, if I lose the trust
with the community,

03:34.165 --> 03:35.761
I'll never get it back.

03:36.267 --> 03:37.863
I hear you, but I don't like it.

03:37.912 --> 03:40.625
And Curtis is a dangerous guy, and...

03:40.838 --> 03:41.958
If anything were to happen to you,

03:42.006 --> 03:45.189
I'd be sad for, like,
at least a couple days.

03:46.541 --> 03:47.694
Funny. Funny.

03:47.845 --> 03:49.732
But I can handle myself.

03:49.990 --> 03:51.510
Alright?

03:52.202 --> 03:53.977
I'll call you after.

03:54.757 --> 03:57.231
I wish we could open an official
investigation on this.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.663
No, sir, I get it, there's not even

03:58.711 --> 04:00.686
circumstantial evidence
connecting Jason

04:00.749 --> 04:02.044
to planting those drugs.

04:02.093 --> 04:04.647
Thank you, again, for authorizing my...

04:04.999 --> 04:06.649
- "vacation."
- Of course.

04:06.697 --> 04:08.429
Take as much time as you need.

04:08.966 --> 04:10.119
So, what's your plan?

04:10.167 --> 04:11.379
Find the money.

04:11.514 --> 04:13.935
I mean, those drugs cost upwards
of 10 grand,

04:14.038 --> 04:16.218
but according to my skip tracer,
Jason's broke.

04:16.285 --> 04:17.505
He had to pay restitution

04:17.562 --> 04:18.786
for his embezzlement conviction,

04:18.834 --> 04:20.403
and he's been working
a minimum-wage job

04:20.452 --> 04:21.664
ever since his release.

04:21.712 --> 04:24.030
So chances are, he's mixed up
in something illegal

04:24.079 --> 04:26.666
that gives him access
to money or drugs or both.

04:26.715 --> 04:29.003
And I'm gonna follow him till
I find out exactly what it is.

04:29.153 --> 04:30.964
Call me as soon as you have
something actionable,

04:31.013 --> 04:34.030
even if it's a simple parole violation.

04:34.165 --> 04:36.279
Once he's in custody,
he's more likely to crack.

04:38.936 --> 04:40.786
I gotta go. Caught a homicide.

04:40.835 --> 04:42.772
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thank you.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.487
Say, listen, Nolan,

04:44.535 --> 04:46.414
there's something
you need to think about.

04:47.116 --> 04:49.327
If Bailey assumes fault
for the drugs...

04:49.405 --> 04:51.961
I know, if I can't prove
Jason planted those drugs,

04:52.009 --> 04:53.529
I'll have to choose between my career

04:53.577 --> 04:55.237
and the woman I love.

04:55.846 --> 04:57.355
No biggie.

04:57.581 --> 04:58.827
Thanks.

04:59.890 --> 05:01.505
ADA Sanford.

05:01.991 --> 05:03.090
Officer Chen.

05:03.139 --> 05:04.628
Did you hear the news?

05:04.677 --> 05:07.376
The store owner from
Tyler's case pulled through.

05:07.424 --> 05:08.843
- I heard.
- Mm-hmm.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.327
I'm as relieved as you are.

05:10.998 --> 05:12.356
Great. So,

05:12.404 --> 05:13.960
let's continue, with the positivity.

05:14.008 --> 05:16.037
Charge Tyler as a minor.

05:16.170 --> 05:17.890
He committed a crime with a gun.

05:17.939 --> 05:19.322
It was unloaded.

05:19.370 --> 05:22.058
Look, I'm not saying that
there shouldn't be consequences,

05:22.106 --> 05:23.693
but he's 16.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.702
He's not old enough to drink,
vote, join the military,

05:26.750 --> 05:27.874
and you want to lock him up

05:27.922 --> 05:29.475
with a bunch of grown men?

05:29.620 --> 05:31.296
- Look, studies show that...
- No, please,

05:31.344 --> 05:32.601
don't quote studies at me.

05:32.650 --> 05:34.403
And definitely don't start lecturing me

05:34.451 --> 05:36.072
about the science
of stilldeveloping brains

05:36.120 --> 05:37.671
in men under 21.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.108
I wasn't gonna do that.

05:40.724 --> 05:43.246
Look, if Tyler becomes a CI
against his crew,

05:43.294 --> 05:45.081
I can definitely give him a break.

05:45.129 --> 05:46.179
Uh...

05:46.228 --> 05:47.757
Wait, s-sorry. Let me...

05:47.805 --> 05:48.851
Let me just get this clear.

05:48.899 --> 05:50.620
So, instead of risking his life
in prison,

05:50.668 --> 05:52.521
you want to risk his life
on the streets?

05:52.569 --> 05:53.827
Do you understand that he is

05:53.875 --> 05:55.224
a low-level drug runner?

05:55.272 --> 05:57.339
He is the bottom of the food chain.

05:57.708 --> 05:59.635
Nobody in his crew is
gonna even trust him,

05:59.684 --> 06:00.848
with any real intel.

06:00.936 --> 06:02.700
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

06:02.749 --> 06:04.973
Mr., uh, Rookie ADA here

06:05.022 --> 06:07.203
was telling me
how he was gonna make his bones

06:07.251 --> 06:09.939
- by ending a kid's life.
- Okay.

06:09.987 --> 06:12.441
You're clearly feeling a
little dramatic this morning,

06:12.489 --> 06:14.289
and I have to go to court.

06:17.261 --> 06:19.708
I will be following up with you!

06:20.331 --> 06:21.633
Can you believe the nerve of that guy,

06:21.681 --> 06:23.119
calling <i>me</i> dramatic?

06:23.167 --> 06:25.121
I mean... Um, do not start.

06:25.169 --> 06:26.571
Exactly how many cups of coffee

06:26.620 --> 06:28.025
did you have this morning?

06:28.516 --> 06:30.305
I'm just going to apologize
to you right now.

06:30.354 --> 06:32.626
Um, it's gonna be a really
long day for you, and...

06:32.675 --> 06:34.230
And I'm sorry.

06:34.418 --> 06:36.680
- Aaron.
- Mom, what are you doing here?

06:36.915 --> 06:38.467
Hi, baby. Mwah.

06:38.515 --> 06:40.469
Look at you in this uniform.

06:40.517 --> 06:42.471
How handsome.

06:42.657 --> 06:45.241
Look, I said no yesterday,
and I meant it, okay?

06:45.290 --> 06:46.842
- Uh-huh.
- So please stop asking.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.227
But you're not thinking it through.

06:48.276 --> 06:50.326
- The hell I'm not.
- Whoa, what's the problem?

06:50.374 --> 06:52.790
Nothing, just having a
conversation with my mother.

06:53.398 --> 06:54.656
Now I know you did not just speak

06:54.704 --> 06:56.563
to your mother in that tone.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.231
Ma'am, I am Nyla Harper,

06:58.279 --> 06:59.711
Aaron's training officer,

06:59.844 --> 07:02.291
and he is going to apologize
to you right now,

07:02.339 --> 07:04.282
or I will write him up, for conduct

07:04.330 --> 07:06.196
unbecoming of an officer.

07:09.857 --> 07:11.210
I'm sorry.

07:11.461 --> 07:12.624
Thank you.

07:12.688 --> 07:13.803
And thank you, Nyla.

07:13.851 --> 07:14.930
Of course, Mrs. Thorsen.

07:14.978 --> 07:17.132
- It's Yvonne.
- Yvonne.

07:18.001 --> 07:19.255
See you in the shop.

07:19.304 --> 07:20.360
Oh.

07:20.409 --> 07:21.412
I like her.

07:21.461 --> 07:23.145
- Look, Mom...
- I like her.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.602
I'm sorry for going off, okay?

07:24.651 --> 07:26.505
But I don't want to be a part
of this reality TV show.

07:26.554 --> 07:28.445
Sweetie, it's only gonna help you.

07:28.494 --> 07:29.555
How?

07:29.797 --> 07:31.954
By disrespecting the memory of Patrick?

07:32.002 --> 07:33.712
By trivializing the time
I've spent in prison

07:33.761 --> 07:34.881
for a crime I didn't commit?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.648
Not if we control the narrative.

07:36.697 --> 07:37.850
Mom,

07:37.975 --> 07:39.162
I love you, okay?

07:39.211 --> 07:40.969
You've been on my side
through everything, but,

07:41.018 --> 07:42.198
the answer's no.

07:42.550 --> 07:43.950
Now I have to go.

07:52.182 --> 07:54.789
I think this may be
our strangest date yet.

07:54.838 --> 07:57.337
Really? Stranger than
fighting a Russian spy?

07:57.386 --> 08:00.585
We're surveilling your
excon current husband

08:00.634 --> 08:02.344
who has framed you for a drug crime.

08:02.433 --> 08:05.469
<i>Estranged</i> ex-con current husband.

08:05.562 --> 08:07.183
Oh, good.

08:07.271 --> 08:09.592
- Hey, Randy.
<i>- Skip Tracer Randy here!</i>

08:09.640 --> 08:11.392
Yes. I know, Randy.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.492
I said your name.

08:12.541 --> 08:14.631
<i>Oh, well, maybe you know
12 Randys, I don't know.</i>

08:14.680 --> 08:15.898
<i>Would you like to know what I found,</i>

08:15.946 --> 08:17.345
<i>or do you want to keep</i>
<i>making me feel bad</i>

08:17.400 --> 08:18.937
<i>about how I put myself out</i>
<i>in the world?</i>

08:18.986 --> 08:20.668
No. No, Randy, you're right.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.405
I'm sorry. What did you get?

08:22.453 --> 08:25.441
<i>Jason listed an SRO downtown
as his current address,</i>

08:25.489 --> 08:26.909
<i>but the man at the front desk says</i>

08:26.957 --> 08:28.537
<i>he's only seen him once or twice.</i>

08:28.586 --> 08:30.117
So he could be staying somewhere else.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.486
That could be a
violation of his parole.

08:31.534 --> 08:32.732
Mm-hmm.
- <i>That is correct.</i>

08:32.782 --> 08:34.678
<i>I'll call back if I find anything else.</i>

08:34.727 --> 08:35.857
Thank you, Randy.

08:35.907 --> 08:37.186
Well, that makes sense.

08:37.234 --> 08:39.008
Jason is a total snob.

08:40.899 --> 08:42.366
Is this really the best we can do?

08:42.414 --> 08:44.322
Just spy on him until he hopefully

08:44.370 --> 08:46.002
does something overtly criminal?

08:46.051 --> 08:47.210
Welcome to police work.

08:47.259 --> 08:49.431
We're never gonna catch him
by being reactive.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.551
He's too smart.

08:50.599 --> 08:52.012
We have to get in his head.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.994
If that's, really,

08:54.042 --> 08:55.336
what you want to do,

08:55.385 --> 08:57.623
I know who to talk to, but it would

08:57.671 --> 08:59.517
officially cement this as

08:59.565 --> 09:02.367
1,000% the strangest date yet.

09:02.462 --> 09:03.986
Well, when you put it that way...

09:06.369 --> 09:08.976
At this point, you should
probably deputize me.

09:11.541 --> 09:12.601
<i>Hello.</i>

09:12.650 --> 09:14.032
Who did you bring for me, John?

09:14.080 --> 09:15.494
Oscar, this is Lieutenant Nune.

09:15.543 --> 09:16.582
Bailey.

09:16.631 --> 09:18.462
I'm Jason Wyler's...

09:18.510 --> 09:20.252
- Wife.
- Well, I'd salute you,

09:20.300 --> 09:22.207
but I can't get my
arm over my shoulder.

09:22.925 --> 09:24.543
I'm told you're an expert,

09:24.591 --> 09:26.529
in narcissist psychopaths.

09:26.578 --> 09:28.032
Guilty as charged.

09:28.689 --> 09:29.781
Literally.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.716
We need your help
to get inside his head,

09:31.764 --> 09:33.251
figure out what he's gonna do next.

09:33.299 --> 09:34.886
And I would love to do that.

09:35.287 --> 09:37.326
I just need to figure out
what I get out of it.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.602
Oscar.

09:38.651 --> 09:40.130
I wrote a letter,

09:40.326 --> 09:41.688
to get you transferred out of here.

09:41.737 --> 09:43.291
And that's what I got yesterday.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.927
Let's discuss what I get today.

09:44.976 --> 09:46.463
Today, I go to the Warden's office

09:46.512 --> 09:48.018
and rip up yesterday's letter.

09:48.066 --> 09:49.455
- You're bluffing.
- Let's go.

09:49.568 --> 09:51.155
Okay, fine. I'll help you.

09:51.751 --> 09:53.377
Um, alright, where do we stand?

09:53.456 --> 09:55.929
Jason and I were married for a year,

09:55.978 --> 09:57.149
before he went to prison.

09:57.198 --> 10:00.153
During that time,
he was psychologically abusive,

10:00.202 --> 10:03.462
he tore me down constantly,
and terrorized me,

10:03.510 --> 10:04.902
when I asked for a divorce.

10:04.951 --> 10:07.259
Two weeks ago, he got out of jail and,

10:07.307 --> 10:09.521
set out to ruin my life.

10:09.569 --> 10:11.627
He planted drugs in her car
and got her arrested.

10:11.676 --> 10:13.127
Okay, so...

10:13.302 --> 10:14.692
He's highly intelligent,

10:14.741 --> 10:17.462
he's very good at getting
inside people's heads,

10:17.510 --> 10:19.488
and pitting people against one another.

10:19.562 --> 10:21.483
<i>He's also deeply insecure.</i>

10:21.532 --> 10:23.689
That's why he's constantly
pounding you down,

10:23.738 --> 10:24.877
making you small.

10:24.926 --> 10:26.908
It's the only way
he can make himself big.

10:27.028 --> 10:28.911
How do we use that against him?

10:29.922 --> 10:32.605
Well, best way to throw
him off of his game is...

10:32.939 --> 10:34.475
Demean him.

10:34.961 --> 10:36.648
Make him feel stupid.

10:36.783 --> 10:38.149
Belittle him.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.969
Of course, he's gonna retaliate,
like, ten-fold.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.524
How did he get his hands on those drugs

10:42.573 --> 10:46.017
- in the first place?
- Probably a contact in prison.

10:46.137 --> 10:47.547
Whoever it was he was paying

10:47.595 --> 10:48.946
for protection on the inside.

10:48.995 --> 10:51.216
But he wouldn't have gotten
the drugs for free.

10:51.265 --> 10:52.692
Well, it's not hard to get money,

10:52.782 --> 10:54.403
I mean,
if you're willing to con someone.

10:54.452 --> 10:55.900
In fact, there's an entire network

10:55.948 --> 10:57.228
of nightingales out there

10:57.277 --> 10:59.392
<i>that are just waiting
to help rehabilitate</i>

10:59.441 --> 11:01.664
some poor, misunderstood man.

11:01.799 --> 11:03.420
Speaking from experience?

11:03.523 --> 11:05.885
I get a little money in
my commissary account.

11:06.114 --> 11:08.917
They get a romantic fantasy.

11:09.195 --> 11:10.589
I mean...

11:11.238 --> 11:12.951
Everybody wins.

11:13.142 --> 11:15.474
Now, your boy, though,
he's playing the long game.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.396
<i>He's probably targeted
a dozen or so women</i>

11:18.445 --> 11:19.983
just to find the right one.

11:20.205 --> 11:22.159
The warden will have
copies of all of Jason's mail.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.344
- We can start there.
- Yeah.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.735
Alright. Thank you.

11:38.057 --> 11:39.330
Thanks.

11:39.378 --> 11:40.492
You called us?

11:40.541 --> 11:43.181
Yeah, a jogger found a
female DB under the overpass.

11:43.229 --> 11:45.517
<i>Blunt force trauma to the head.
Dump job.</i>

11:45.566 --> 11:47.994
<i>Looks like she's been here
about 24 hours.</i>

11:48.043 --> 11:50.808
<i>Found an ID on her.
Rebecca Price, 18 years old.</i>

11:50.887 --> 11:52.107
Sounds like you got it handled.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.778
What do you need a sergeant for?

11:53.966 --> 11:55.886
I don't. I need Lucy.

11:56.364 --> 11:57.994
Do you know her?

11:58.117 --> 12:00.003
No. Uh, why?

12:00.855 --> 12:02.599
Your roommate does.

12:11.819 --> 12:13.673
Alright, how do you want
to handle this?

12:13.990 --> 12:15.122
I don't know. I've...

12:15.170 --> 12:16.662
I've never delivered
a death notification

12:16.710 --> 12:18.200
to someone I care about.

12:21.178 --> 12:22.498
I know what to do as a cop,

12:22.546 --> 12:24.717
and I know how to do it as a roommate,
but, you know,

12:24.765 --> 12:26.654
those are different approaches.

12:26.739 --> 12:28.170
Just be a friend.

12:28.304 --> 12:30.472
And if you need a cop, tag me in.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.670
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

12:32.870 --> 12:34.224
Come in.

12:35.859 --> 12:37.111
Forget something?

12:38.295 --> 12:39.690
No.

12:42.691 --> 12:46.093
They found a body, this morning.

12:48.272 --> 12:51.026
It was your friend. Becca.

12:51.807 --> 12:52.967
What?

12:53.099 --> 12:54.295
No.

12:54.401 --> 12:55.754
I'm sorry.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.262
No, no, no.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.467
No, i-it can't be her.

12:58.515 --> 12:59.615
It wasn't Becca.

12:59.663 --> 13:01.295
- I'll call her.
- I'm sorry.

13:01.343 --> 13:03.456
It definitely was her.

13:04.157 --> 13:06.611
There was a photo of the
two of you on her phone.

13:09.689 --> 13:10.914
Oh, look.

13:10.962 --> 13:12.115
Here's one of mine.

13:12.164 --> 13:14.423
A desperate plea
to respond to my lawyer.

13:14.549 --> 13:15.936
Fun memento.

13:16.093 --> 13:18.469
Here's one from Jason
to an Evelyn Reed.

13:18.518 --> 13:20.623
"When we met, I was so broken."

13:20.671 --> 13:21.950
"You healed me."

13:22.221 --> 13:25.195
Oh, he's still using
the same material he used on me.

13:25.355 --> 13:26.858
I can't believe I was this stupid.

13:26.941 --> 13:28.703
No, you weren't stupid.
You were just...

13:28.751 --> 13:30.138
Trusting.

13:30.187 --> 13:32.174
Here's one from Evelyn back to Jason.

13:32.493 --> 13:33.615
"Dear Jason,"

13:33.663 --> 13:35.858
"I must have read your
last letter a thousand times."

13:35.907 --> 13:38.146
"Though steel bars may
separate our bodies,"

13:38.268 --> 13:40.155
"they can't separate our souls."

13:40.204 --> 13:41.324
Barf.

13:41.373 --> 13:42.734
But that does sound like someone

13:42.788 --> 13:44.359
who would do anything for him.

13:44.411 --> 13:45.714
What's her address?

13:45.834 --> 13:48.564
Did Becca ever mention
someone she was scared of?

13:48.743 --> 13:50.313
No.

13:51.112 --> 13:53.266
But we haven't talked in a while.

13:53.522 --> 13:55.236
Almost three months.

13:55.816 --> 13:57.409
With school and

13:57.457 --> 13:59.564
moving in here, I just lost track.

13:59.616 --> 14:02.271
Okay, any idea where she was crashing?

14:04.458 --> 14:06.297
She mostly lived on the street.

14:06.594 --> 14:09.816
There was a shelter
that sometimes had room.

14:09.951 --> 14:12.675
And a couple of kids
who had families who'd

14:12.723 --> 14:15.388
let you sleep on the
floor every once in a while.

14:15.861 --> 14:17.514
And if you were desperate enough,

14:17.563 --> 14:19.377
there was always swiping.

14:20.976 --> 14:22.743
What's that?

14:24.404 --> 14:26.100
You go on ClipTalk,

14:26.148 --> 14:29.471
and just swipe until you
find someone to hook up with.

14:29.717 --> 14:31.415
And if you're lucky,

14:31.507 --> 14:34.943
you might get a warm shower and a meal,

14:35.279 --> 14:36.686
when it's all over.

14:36.771 --> 14:38.391
<i>Okay, if she was still
doing that,</i>

14:38.440 --> 14:40.287
we need a list of the guys
she met up with.

14:40.364 --> 14:41.814
I'll reach out to the tech department,

14:41.862 --> 14:43.182
see if they can get into her account.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.818
No. I bet I can guess her password.

14:45.966 --> 14:47.366
<i>So,
what's the deal with your mom?</i>

14:47.414 --> 14:49.874
That is a long
and boring story.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.209
Which, stakeouts are made for.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.767
Oh, is that what we're doing here?

14:53.815 --> 14:56.284
- Who are we staking out?
- We're just keeping an eye on a friend.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.420
<i>Is it one of those guys?</i>

14:57.468 --> 14:58.823
<i>Stop trying to change the subject.</i>

14:58.872 --> 15:00.870
- You and your mom.
- Look, it's complicated.

15:00.991 --> 15:02.631
You're gonna have to threaten me with a
blue page,

15:02.679 --> 15:03.803
if you want me to say any more.

15:03.852 --> 15:05.090
Alright. Fair enough.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.006
Oh, now it makes sense.

15:09.055 --> 15:10.175
<i>Why didn't you just say we was here</i>

15:10.224 --> 15:12.264
- <i>to watch your boyfriend's back?
- Look, James is looking out</i>

15:12.312 --> 15:13.246
<i>for a neighborhood kid.</i>

15:13.295 --> 15:15.031
<i>He's pushing back
against a local dealer,</i>

15:15.080 --> 15:17.600
so we are here in case
anything goes sideways.

15:17.841 --> 15:20.529
Look, I heard you're still
trying to collect Tyler's debt

15:20.578 --> 15:22.022
from some of his family members.

15:22.071 --> 15:23.391
The kid owes me.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.113
Curtis, he-he's in jail

15:25.162 --> 15:26.502
'cause he tried to get your money.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.604
It's not my fault he can't
stick up a liquor store.

15:31.420 --> 15:33.553
Uh, Harper.

15:33.602 --> 15:35.007
You have got to be kidding me.

15:35.056 --> 15:36.610
<i>I assume we should stop him, yeah?</i>

15:38.834 --> 15:40.178
7-Adam-19,

15:40.226 --> 15:41.795
Code 6 on a 459.

15:41.844 --> 15:45.333
Suspect is a Hispanic male,
blue jeans, grey jacket.

15:47.506 --> 15:49.543
Hey! Stop right there!

15:49.794 --> 15:51.145
Stop! Hey!

16:11.728 --> 16:13.177
Hey. You okay?

16:13.232 --> 16:14.283
You alright?

16:14.331 --> 16:15.484
You okay? You okay?

16:16.789 --> 16:19.143
- Oh, that's deep.
- You're gonna need stitches.

16:19.192 --> 16:20.951
Yeah, and couple's therapy.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.474
I don't follow.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.477
I promised James
I'd mind my own business.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.902
Yeah, you're definitely busted.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.391
7-Adam-19.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.103
I need additional units
to follow our 459 suspect,

16:30.152 --> 16:32.439
last seen at Grant and Lennox.

16:32.488 --> 16:35.185
I also need an RA
for an injured officer.

16:36.118 --> 16:39.173
Alright, Lopez sent a PDF
of Becca's ClipTalk account.

16:39.222 --> 16:40.870
It looks like
she was routinely hooking up

16:40.919 --> 16:42.473
with four different guys.

16:42.607 --> 16:44.482
No DMs indicating that they made plans

16:44.530 --> 16:45.881
to meet up in the past week.

16:45.929 --> 16:47.489
Yeah, well, Lopez should
look into all of them.

16:47.537 --> 16:50.076
ClipTalk might not be
the only way they communicate.

16:51.162 --> 16:52.588
You okay?

16:52.826 --> 16:54.209
Yeah, Tamara knew about the whole

16:54.257 --> 16:56.667
swiping thing, like, right away.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.505
Did you get the impression that maybe

16:58.553 --> 17:00.062
she used to do it herself?

17:00.895 --> 17:02.576
She ever mention it to you?

17:02.716 --> 17:04.123
As close as we are, there's a lot

17:04.171 --> 17:05.334
she won't talk about.

17:05.382 --> 17:06.473
Don't take it personally.

17:06.522 --> 17:09.111
She might just have a hard time
opening up to you.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.929
But I'm sure Tamara will
share when she's ready to.

17:15.319 --> 17:16.525
Who are you?

17:16.574 --> 17:18.201
- I'm Jason's wife.
- Right.

17:18.306 --> 17:19.900
The bitch who won't give him a divorce

17:19.964 --> 17:21.134
'cause she's obsessed, and you're

17:21.182 --> 17:22.297
the crooked cop boyfriend.

17:22.346 --> 17:23.698
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

17:23.747 --> 17:25.920
Ma'am, none of that is true.

17:25.969 --> 17:27.960
- May we come in and talk?
- Hell no.

17:28.064 --> 17:30.330
Ms. Reed, Jason is a dangerous

17:30.378 --> 17:32.291
and manipulative man
who may be involved

17:32.339 --> 17:33.472
in illegal activities.

17:33.521 --> 17:35.881
- Lies.
- Okay, how about this?

17:36.330 --> 17:37.617
Is Jason living here?

17:37.666 --> 17:39.463
Because if he is, he has not reported

17:39.511 --> 17:40.703
this address to his PO,

17:40.751 --> 17:42.088
which means I can report the violation

17:42.136 --> 17:43.681
of his parole in one phone call.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.107
If you've aided in any of the crimes

17:45.155 --> 17:46.406
he's committed in any way,

17:46.455 --> 17:48.651
you can be charged as an accessory.

17:48.862 --> 17:50.173
Or...

17:50.221 --> 17:52.418
How about we just talk?

17:54.499 --> 17:57.154
Jason said that you
might try to get me to

17:57.412 --> 17:59.182
turn on him.

17:59.770 --> 18:01.642
It isn't gonna work, so,

18:01.690 --> 18:03.818
come in and say
whatever you have to say,

18:03.867 --> 18:05.395
and then go.

18:06.568 --> 18:08.621
He told you about his mother, right?

18:08.670 --> 18:09.841
How close they were?

18:09.890 --> 18:11.844
How broken he was when she died?

18:12.150 --> 18:14.231
- May I sit?
- Uh-huh.

18:15.719 --> 18:19.644
That was what first drew me to him.

18:19.857 --> 18:21.811
That depth of feeling.

18:21.859 --> 18:24.357
When we first met,
my father had just died,

18:24.405 --> 18:26.061
and I was a wreck.

18:26.169 --> 18:29.521
Jason was the only person
who understood.

18:29.831 --> 18:32.334
He didn't try to fix me.
He just listened.

18:32.383 --> 18:35.672
He held my hand,
made me his entire world.

18:35.873 --> 18:38.019
So I made him mine.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.492
I had no one else but him.

18:41.928 --> 18:44.893
And he started chipping away at me.

18:45.185 --> 18:47.495
I wasn't smart enough,

18:47.885 --> 18:50.003
thin enough, pretty enough.

18:50.071 --> 18:52.620
But I was lucky to have him...

18:54.179 --> 18:56.800
because who else could ever want me?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.187
I wanted to die.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.910
I was even planning how I would do it.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.763
That was when I finally woke up.

19:14.076 --> 19:15.341
I'm sorry.

19:19.498 --> 19:20.904
Forgive me for asking.

19:20.953 --> 19:23.541
- Is Jason's car in your name?
- Yeah.

19:23.590 --> 19:26.353
Because he's an ex-con, so he said it

19:26.401 --> 19:27.914
would be hard for him to get a loan.

19:27.963 --> 19:29.459
Has he ever asked you to make large

19:29.507 --> 19:31.501
- cash deposits?
- Yes.

19:31.549 --> 19:33.082
And where do you think
that money comes from?

19:33.179 --> 19:34.537
I didn't ask.

19:34.638 --> 19:36.796
Has he ever asked you to buy a gun?

19:37.434 --> 19:38.921
Am I in trouble?

19:40.226 --> 19:41.799
Not if you help us.

19:43.701 --> 19:45.263
So sorry to keep you waiting.

19:45.349 --> 19:47.582
Yeah, uh, I'm all stitched
and ready to go,

19:47.631 --> 19:49.184
so why did I have to hang around?

19:49.232 --> 19:50.753
Your lab work came back,

19:50.801 --> 19:52.921
and I wanted to talk to you about it.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.701
What? Am I...

19:54.749 --> 19:56.947
- Am I sick or something?
- No.

19:57.650 --> 19:59.684
You're six weeks pregnant.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.923
There you go.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.119
- It's all yours.
- Thank you.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.377
- We really appreciate this.
- I'm just...

20:10.425 --> 20:12.884
I'm glad I found out the
truth before it was too late.

20:13.106 --> 20:14.930
Oh, there's one more thing.

20:15.158 --> 20:16.679
Alright,
you think there's something in here

20:16.727 --> 20:17.822
we can use against him?

20:18.033 --> 20:20.367
Well, Jason is good,
but he's far from perfect.

20:20.432 --> 20:21.758
He's gonna mess up at some point.

20:21.807 --> 20:23.461
We just need to be there when he does.

20:23.510 --> 20:24.908
Hey. I'm home

20:24.957 --> 20:26.577
and I'm starving.

20:30.108 --> 20:31.927
What the hell are you doing here?

20:32.392 --> 20:34.179
Th-this is harassment, alright?

20:34.228 --> 20:35.999
Uh, you-you both need to leave.

20:36.629 --> 20:37.783
You okay, babe?

20:37.832 --> 20:39.232
You don't have to listen to
them, you know?

20:39.280 --> 20:41.453
- You have rights.
- I know.

20:44.359 --> 20:45.409
Get out.

20:45.457 --> 20:47.197
What? Oh, come on.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.271
I-I told you,
they're trying to frame me.

20:49.845 --> 20:51.361
Now, you are too smart to fall for

20:51.409 --> 20:52.969
whatever it is that
they're trying to tell you.

20:53.017 --> 20:54.493
Bailey told me everything.

20:54.542 --> 20:57.698
You used all the same lies on
her that you used on me.

20:57.747 --> 21:01.484
Bailey is a very sick woman,

21:01.624 --> 21:03.252
a drug addict, paranoid, delusional...

21:03.301 --> 21:05.021
No, I need you to leave now.

21:05.070 --> 21:06.773
This is my house,

21:06.875 --> 21:08.247
and I want you to leave.

21:08.296 --> 21:09.712
And don't bother coming back.

21:09.783 --> 21:11.783
A restraining order will be
filed before you hit the street.

21:11.994 --> 21:13.814
Well, I look forward
to having your badge

21:13.863 --> 21:16.093
after I win my lawsuit
against the LAPD.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.263
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:18.363 --> 21:19.877
- That stays here.
- That's mine.

21:19.926 --> 21:21.394
No, it's <i>mine.</i>

21:22.327 --> 21:24.672
I paid for this.
I paid for all of that.

21:24.758 --> 21:26.110
Fine.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.107
Oh! Want me to light them up?

21:40.666 --> 21:41.844
What?

21:41.965 --> 21:43.658
That green car
just made an illegal turn.

21:43.764 --> 21:45.397
Oh, uh...

21:45.561 --> 21:46.865
No.

21:48.110 --> 21:49.631
Are you okay?

21:49.818 --> 21:51.099
I mean, you've been pretty quiet since

21:51.147 --> 21:52.777
we left the hospital.

21:53.042 --> 21:54.645
Nah, it's just, uh...

21:56.127 --> 21:57.561
Uh, I'm pregnant.

21:59.004 --> 22:00.193
Oh!

22:01.093 --> 22:02.486
Congratulations?

22:02.674 --> 22:04.689
Yeah, I mean, uh, they just

22:04.738 --> 22:06.592
told me at the hospital.

22:06.713 --> 22:08.158
And it was unexpected, huh?

22:10.776 --> 22:12.533
Uh, after Lila,

22:12.581 --> 22:14.599
I had some serious complications,

22:14.647 --> 22:16.369
and I was told that

22:16.753 --> 22:18.493
I couldn't get pregnant.

22:20.033 --> 22:22.518
Clearly, I should have
followed up with a specialist.

22:22.722 --> 22:25.056
Are you worried about how James
is gonna take the news?

22:25.464 --> 22:27.745
James is amazing.

22:28.724 --> 22:30.933
But we've only been together
a few months, and I...

22:30.997 --> 22:33.084
- We never thought that...
- Yeah.

22:34.057 --> 22:35.920
That sounds like a lot to process.

22:35.968 --> 22:37.255
Yeah.

22:37.303 --> 22:38.936
So, what are you gonna do?

22:39.405 --> 22:42.736
Avoid dealing with it
until absolutely necessary.

22:42.797 --> 22:44.685
Yeah.

22:45.372 --> 22:47.595
I use that method a lot.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.233
What the hell
am I doing here?

22:49.281 --> 22:52.158
Martin, are you familiar with
a girl named Becca Price?

22:52.284 --> 22:53.905
Uh, yeah.

22:54.599 --> 22:56.465
- We're friends.
- Friends?

22:56.637 --> 22:58.020
With an 18-year-old?

22:58.091 --> 22:59.143
<i>How about she found you</i>

22:59.191 --> 23:01.279
looking for sex on ClipTalk
a few months ago,

23:01.327 --> 23:03.381
and you've been hooking up
every now and then

23:03.429 --> 23:05.495
in exchange for letting her
sleep in your bed.

23:05.544 --> 23:06.718
Look, what is she saying?

23:06.766 --> 23:08.768
<i>'Cause I don't know if you know,</i>
but that girl is homeless,

23:08.816 --> 23:09.914
<i>unstable.</i>

23:09.963 --> 23:11.483
She's probably on drugs or something.

23:11.532 --> 23:12.623
She's dead.

23:12.671 --> 23:14.039
What?

23:14.436 --> 23:15.555
I didn't...

23:16.060 --> 23:17.128
That wasn't me.

23:17.176 --> 23:18.563
Where were you last night?

23:18.611 --> 23:20.041
At home.

23:21.732 --> 23:23.743
Look, Becca did come over,

23:24.414 --> 23:25.800
but only for a few minutes.

23:25.951 --> 23:27.138
I swear.

23:27.186 --> 23:28.639
- What time?
- Eight-ish.

23:28.687 --> 23:30.241
It was definitely before 9:00.

23:30.564 --> 23:32.010
That's when my girlfriend got home.

23:32.834 --> 23:33.967
Your girlfriend?

23:34.016 --> 23:35.439
Yeah, she travels.

23:35.662 --> 23:37.631
- I get lonely.
- What did Becca want?

23:37.692 --> 23:40.057
A place to sleep, a shower.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.115
<i>I told her my girlfriend
was on her way.</i>

23:42.234 --> 23:43.624
Look, Becca threatened to tell on me

23:43.672 --> 23:44.940
if I didn't give her money.

23:44.989 --> 23:46.442
All I had was a 20.

23:46.830 --> 23:48.050
After she left,

23:48.099 --> 23:50.328
I realized she stole my Cerus watch.

23:50.376 --> 23:51.519
<i>Cost me 10 grand.</i>

23:51.568 --> 23:53.620
<i>And you couldn't file a police report</i>

23:53.669 --> 23:56.054
because you would have to
explain what happened

23:56.103 --> 23:57.570
to your girlfriend.

23:58.918 --> 24:00.950
Okay. Sit tight.

24:01.837 --> 24:04.005
Please, I didn't hurt that girl.

24:04.890 --> 24:06.511
You have to believe me.

24:07.724 --> 24:09.514
There was no watch on Becca's body.

24:09.562 --> 24:11.049
Whoever killed her probably took it.

24:11.097 --> 24:12.331
Or maybe she sold it.

24:12.379 --> 24:13.618
Tamara might know where.

24:13.666 --> 24:14.677
Good news.

24:14.725 --> 24:16.687
They got inside Jason's laptop

24:16.735 --> 24:19.524
and found a very intricate
money-laundering operation.

24:19.572 --> 24:21.526
That's great. Who's he working for?

24:21.574 --> 24:22.731
They can't tell yet.

24:22.780 --> 24:25.196
Jason works a pretty
skilled shell game.

24:25.366 --> 24:28.199
<i>But, Financial Crimes
are monitoring the accounts,</i>

24:28.247 --> 24:29.591
and if he tries to move any money,

24:29.639 --> 24:30.817
- they'll track it.
- He won't.

24:30.865 --> 24:32.206
He knows we have his laptop.

24:32.255 --> 24:33.404
He'll assume you're watching.

24:33.452 --> 24:35.012
Well, he'll have to move
the money eventually.

24:35.060 --> 24:36.908
Whoever he's working for
is gonna expect results.

24:37.035 --> 24:38.427
So, what's his next move?

24:38.591 --> 24:39.831
I don't know.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.045
Yet.

24:42.177 --> 24:43.236
Uh-oh.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.751
Looks like your avoidance plan
just hit a speed bump.

24:46.765 --> 24:48.599
Okay, our first official fight.

24:48.747 --> 24:50.989
So, I'll lay out
the way I handle conflict,

24:51.106 --> 24:52.156
which is to go right at it.

24:52.204 --> 24:55.068
I asked you to let me handle
the Curtis situation

24:55.116 --> 24:56.700
by myself, but you...

24:56.748 --> 24:58.224
- you didn't listen.
- I...

24:58.272 --> 25:00.072
Yeah, you were only there
in case something happened.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.013
I get it, sure.

25:01.061 --> 25:03.764
But that's not the point,
I expressed my desire,

25:03.812 --> 25:05.825
and you ignored it,
and that pisses me off.

25:05.874 --> 25:07.160
I mean, if you don't trust me

25:07.208 --> 25:09.708
when I tell you that I
got something handled,

25:09.771 --> 25:12.165
then that's something that
we gotta work out, because,

25:12.213 --> 25:14.550
- if we can't trust each other
- I'm pregnant.

25:19.153 --> 25:21.452
I-I-I can't tell if you're joking.

25:22.070 --> 25:23.560
I'm not.

25:25.137 --> 25:26.524
I just found out.

25:26.966 --> 25:28.870
Harper. Uh, we need to go.

25:28.919 --> 25:30.261
My mom just sent a 911 text,

25:30.309 --> 25:31.950
and she's not answering her phone.

25:33.523 --> 25:34.783
Alright.

25:35.018 --> 25:36.512
What's up?

25:42.153 --> 25:43.940
I'll call you after my shift.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.922
Becca talked about you all the time.

25:50.653 --> 25:51.729
Really?

25:51.857 --> 25:54.237
She was always wondering
what you were up to.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.363
She was so proud.

25:58.044 --> 25:59.724
It was kind of annoying, actually.

25:59.911 --> 26:02.396
I was like, "Damn, why you
so obsessed with Tamara?

26:02.508 --> 26:03.715
Stop."

26:06.178 --> 26:07.465
But for real.

26:08.223 --> 26:09.823
We're all proud.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.303
I should've stayed in better touch.

26:12.351 --> 26:13.848
I-I'm sorry.

26:20.717 --> 26:23.194
- Look out.
- No. It's okay.

26:23.562 --> 26:24.996
They're cool.

26:27.270 --> 26:28.601
Hey.

26:29.868 --> 26:31.255
How are you holding up?

26:31.510 --> 26:32.951
It's just a lot.

26:33.402 --> 26:34.911
Being back here.

26:35.934 --> 26:37.817
- Did you find out anything?
- Yes, uh...

26:37.865 --> 26:39.583
Lopez interviewed all of the men

26:39.631 --> 26:40.748
that Becca was swiping with.

26:40.797 --> 26:42.227
They all have solid alibis.

26:42.276 --> 26:44.116
We did find out that Becca stole a watch
from one of them,

26:44.164 --> 26:45.161
right before she died,

26:45.209 --> 26:46.769
so if we can trace her back there,

26:46.818 --> 26:48.505
we might be able to find out
what happened to her.

26:48.554 --> 26:50.310
Do you have any idea
what Becca would have done

26:50.358 --> 26:51.933
with a stolen watch?

26:53.251 --> 26:54.396
Tamara, hey.

26:54.444 --> 26:56.106
Uh, it's okay.

26:56.201 --> 26:57.621
There's no judgment here.

26:58.583 --> 26:59.985
Um...

27:00.768 --> 27:03.523
there's a pawn shop we used to go to.

27:04.138 --> 27:05.458
Harvey's.

27:05.567 --> 27:07.355
It's just two blocks.

27:07.413 --> 27:09.200
Okay, yeah. We'll check it out.

27:10.636 --> 27:12.301
- Are you okay here?
- Yeah.

27:12.350 --> 27:13.996
Yeah. I'm good.

27:14.045 --> 27:15.266
<i>Okay.</i>

27:15.747 --> 27:16.841
<i>Alright.</i>

27:22.304 --> 27:24.583
Do you still hear the lambs, Clarice?

27:24.677 --> 27:26.264
Oh, Oscar, you're no Hannibal Lecter.

27:26.313 --> 27:27.766
You're more "Ernest Goes to Jail."

27:27.815 --> 27:30.303
Well, you still need my help so, hit me.

27:31.013 --> 27:33.068
Jason was laundering money.
We shut it down.

27:33.117 --> 27:34.255
The arrest warrant's ready to go.

27:34.303 --> 27:35.584
- We just need to find him.
- Well, okay.

27:35.632 --> 27:37.210
Well, let me think about that.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.520
I'm Jason. Right?

27:40.638 --> 27:42.592
My back is against the wall.

27:42.976 --> 27:45.591
The people that I launder money
for are pissed...

27:45.693 --> 27:46.768
Right?

27:46.817 --> 27:48.475
Probably want me dead.

27:48.642 --> 27:50.629
And the police are moving in.

27:50.747 --> 27:51.849
So...

27:52.123 --> 27:53.865
What do I do?

27:56.543 --> 27:57.971
Honestly?

27:58.019 --> 27:59.198
It's really simple.

27:59.660 --> 28:01.119
I just turn myself in.

28:01.408 --> 28:04.036
<i>Flip on my employers</i>
<i>and cut a sweet deal.</i>

28:04.965 --> 28:06.185
<i>John?</i>

28:15.678 --> 28:17.966
Well, you tell Ye that I want in,

28:18.014 --> 28:19.630
so he should call me back.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.412
Hey.

28:22.461 --> 28:23.686
I tried calling you. What's wrong?

28:23.735 --> 28:25.358
Oh, nothing, I...

28:25.555 --> 28:28.295
I just have somebody
I would love for you to meet.

28:28.546 --> 28:29.781
Aaron.

28:29.829 --> 28:30.833
I'm Morris Mackey.

28:30.881 --> 28:32.368
I'm the reality TV producer here.

28:32.416 --> 28:34.125
It's nice to finally meet you.

28:34.618 --> 28:35.671
You are?

28:35.851 --> 28:37.038
Annoyed.

28:37.097 --> 28:38.147
Right.

28:38.195 --> 28:39.609
Uh, I'll make this quick.

28:39.733 --> 28:41.460
I want to change your image.

28:41.530 --> 28:42.842
You've been the villain before,

28:42.890 --> 28:44.085
you've been the victim,

28:44.381 --> 28:45.748
but you've never been the hero.

28:45.904 --> 28:48.647
Let me make you the
hero of your own story.

28:48.799 --> 28:50.924
- That's it.
- Think about it, baby.

28:53.740 --> 28:54.980
So, all parties here are in agreement

28:55.028 --> 28:56.058
on the terms of the deal...

28:56.106 --> 28:57.404
you, Jason Wyler,

28:57.452 --> 28:59.028
admit to residing in an address

28:59.077 --> 29:00.763
not registered
with your parole officer.

29:00.811 --> 29:02.598
<i>You admit to the crime</i>
<i>of laundering money</i>

29:02.646 --> 29:04.801
for the Southern Front
criminal organization.

29:04.850 --> 29:07.051
And you admit to the
crime of planting cocaine

29:07.100 --> 29:09.038
in a vehicle owned by Bailey Nune.

29:10.130 --> 29:11.440
He does.

29:11.971 --> 29:14.763
And, I regret all of it.

29:14.882 --> 29:16.169
Oh, come on.

29:16.233 --> 29:17.880
<i>In exchange for your cooperation</i>

29:17.928 --> 29:19.649
with an investigation
into Southern Front,

29:19.788 --> 29:20.980
we are prepared to offer you

29:21.029 --> 29:22.451
a reduced sentence of 18 months.

29:22.592 --> 29:23.864
18 months?

29:23.977 --> 29:26.232
He nearly ruined my life,
and that's all he gets?

29:26.281 --> 29:27.834
I know. It sucks.

29:28.022 --> 29:29.609
But putting a dent in an organization

29:29.673 --> 29:31.068
as evil as the Southern Front

29:31.116 --> 29:32.895
is just far too...

29:33.197 --> 29:35.164
compelling for the DA's office.

29:35.212 --> 29:36.599
This isn't gonna stop.

29:36.647 --> 29:38.734
The second he gets out,
he'll find me again.

29:38.782 --> 29:40.169
And we'll be ready for him.

29:40.217 --> 29:42.305
<i>I'm gonna be
very clear, Mr. Wyler,</i>

29:42.353 --> 29:43.827
so there's no confusion.

29:44.647 --> 29:47.176
If you try to pull anything
during the operation,

29:47.224 --> 29:50.646
this deal and any sentiment of leniency

29:50.694 --> 29:52.484
we may be feeling toward you

29:52.532 --> 29:54.016
is off the table.

29:58.202 --> 29:59.989
Do you understand?

30:00.249 --> 30:01.636
I understand, sir.

30:01.819 --> 30:04.071
And I promise you, you won't see

30:04.119 --> 30:05.716
any tricks from me.

30:09.758 --> 30:11.164
<i>Nyla's pregnant?</i>

30:11.338 --> 30:12.610
Yeah.

30:12.722 --> 30:14.568
Congratulations.

30:14.678 --> 30:16.217
You guys didn't waste any time.

30:17.561 --> 30:18.719
Oh.

30:18.767 --> 30:19.980
It wasn't planned.

30:20.029 --> 30:21.842
- Not at all.
- Mm.

30:21.944 --> 30:23.537
But. But i-it's great.

30:23.625 --> 30:24.845
Uh-huh.

30:24.963 --> 30:26.397
You don't sound very convincing.

30:26.446 --> 30:27.834
It's just, she told me

30:27.882 --> 30:29.210
in the middle of a fight.

30:29.259 --> 30:30.247
Oh.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.318
Yeah, an argument bomb.

30:31.367 --> 30:33.054
Angela's dropped a few of those on me.

30:33.103 --> 30:34.253
So, how did you respond?

30:35.379 --> 30:36.965
I didn't.

30:38.024 --> 30:39.401
She told you she was pregnant,

30:39.449 --> 30:40.535
and you didn't say anything?

30:40.584 --> 30:41.737
At all?

30:44.078 --> 30:45.632
Okay, so, w-w-what should I do?

30:45.728 --> 30:47.044
It's big gesture time.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.303
You're gonna have to max your
credit card out on this one.

30:49.495 --> 30:51.971
Man.

30:52.134 --> 30:53.874
<i>If you're just joining us...</i>

30:55.654 --> 30:57.217
Oh, hello, Officers.

30:57.265 --> 30:58.759
Shopping around?

30:59.284 --> 31:01.295
Let me guess. A Rams fan, am I right?

31:01.467 --> 31:02.951
Hey, I've got a signed copy

31:02.999 --> 31:04.640
- of Cooper Kupp's...
- We're looking for a stolen

31:04.688 --> 31:06.787
Ceres watch, worth about 10 grand.

31:07.464 --> 31:09.436
So, you come into my shop, accusing me?

31:09.503 --> 31:12.217
Of purchasing stolen
property from homeless teenagers?

31:12.266 --> 31:14.138
We are accusing you of exactly that.

31:14.187 --> 31:16.308
Oh. So I'm the bad guy?

31:16.446 --> 31:18.489
These kids got nobody
looking out for them.

31:18.538 --> 31:20.209
So what if something falls into their
hands

31:20.257 --> 31:21.839
that whoever owned it won't miss?

31:21.888 --> 31:23.419
They're just trying to survive.

31:23.542 --> 31:25.448
I'm a lifeline to these kids.

31:25.756 --> 31:27.361
Were you a lifeline to her?

31:27.410 --> 31:28.830
Oh, man.

31:29.647 --> 31:31.442
- Is she dead?
- Yes.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.461
And the watch could be the reason why.

31:38.115 --> 31:39.631
It was brought in yesterday.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.139
The serial number matches.
Becca was here.

31:46.326 --> 31:47.475
No.

31:47.523 --> 31:49.399
I bought this off Declan.

31:51.388 --> 31:53.058
Isn't that Tamara's friend?

31:54.696 --> 31:56.922
- Are you okay?
- No.

31:57.733 --> 31:59.129
I miss her, too,

31:59.234 --> 32:02.741
and I'm so sorry I haven't been around.

32:05.842 --> 32:07.577
She showed me the watch.

32:07.810 --> 32:09.630
Said that she was gonna
pawn it in the morning

32:09.678 --> 32:11.987
and use the cash to go back to school.

32:13.482 --> 32:15.229
Be like you, she said.

32:15.924 --> 32:17.144
Believe that?

32:18.920 --> 32:20.893
She was gonna leave me, too.

32:21.438 --> 32:24.467
So, she went to sleep, and...

32:25.139 --> 32:27.149
I tried to sneak the watch out, but,

32:27.469 --> 32:29.317
<i>she woke up, and,</i>

32:29.365 --> 32:30.631
she totally freaked on me,

32:30.680 --> 32:32.279
so I-I pushed her and...

32:32.327 --> 32:33.721
And she hit her head,

32:33.770 --> 32:35.125
<i>and there was so much blood.</i>

32:35.174 --> 32:36.498
It-It was an accident.

32:36.546 --> 32:38.589
I swear that I didn't...
- <i>Declan,</i>

32:38.637 --> 32:40.299
show us your hands right now.

32:41.421 --> 32:42.563
Turn around.

32:42.611 --> 32:44.455
<i>Interlace your fingers
behind your head.</i>

32:46.108 --> 32:48.217
7-Adam-100.

32:48.283 --> 32:49.546
Show us Code 4.

32:49.594 --> 32:51.018
Suspect in custody.

32:51.634 --> 32:54.197
- Hey, are you okay?
- No.

32:59.883 --> 33:02.118
<i>So, we have to check
your mic levels.</i>

33:02.167 --> 33:03.654
Can you speak normally for me?

33:04.026 --> 33:06.455
This must be killing you.

33:07.446 --> 33:09.250
Levels are fine.

33:09.728 --> 33:11.428
You talk to Officer Nolan again,

33:11.477 --> 33:13.377
I'll pull your deal. Understood?

33:13.935 --> 33:15.356
Yes, sir.

33:15.477 --> 33:18.493
Now, shall we go over the plan
one last time, Mr. Wyler?

33:19.173 --> 33:20.967
I get them to turn over the money,

33:21.016 --> 33:22.830
confirm turnaround
to the usual accounts,

33:22.878 --> 33:24.832
and you guys swoop in.

33:25.006 --> 33:26.577
In addition to hearing every word,

33:26.626 --> 33:28.148
we've set up a surveillance camera

33:28.197 --> 33:29.603
at the exchange point.

33:29.651 --> 33:30.947
Anything goes wrong, we'll be in there

33:30.995 --> 33:32.173
quick, fast, and in a hurry.

33:32.306 --> 33:34.092
I have no doubt, Sergeant.

33:34.184 --> 33:35.768
Thank you for this.

33:49.782 --> 33:51.392
You know you don't
have to be here for this.

33:51.573 --> 33:52.924
Yes, sir.

33:53.227 --> 33:54.704
Thank you. But I do.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.975
Friendly moving into position.

34:00.115 --> 34:01.869
<i>7-Adam-19, copy.</i>

34:04.112 --> 34:06.373
Okay, you need to get
your head in the game.

34:06.421 --> 34:08.400
Look at me, I just found out
I am pregnant,

34:08.449 --> 34:09.909
and yet, I am focused

34:09.956 --> 34:11.181
and ready to go.

34:11.434 --> 34:13.063
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

34:14.658 --> 34:16.250
You gonna do the show?

34:17.650 --> 34:18.871
I don't know.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.002
I-I just feel like it would cheapen
everything I went through.

34:21.050 --> 34:23.127
Then why are you still struggling?

34:23.719 --> 34:26.427
Because I feel like
I'm letting my mom down.

34:26.902 --> 34:28.070
And?

34:28.119 --> 34:30.514
Because if the show's done right,
then I can

34:30.562 --> 34:32.447
finally control the way people see me.

34:32.496 --> 34:33.897
Hmm.

34:39.088 --> 34:40.241
Not a good time, Oscar.

34:40.289 --> 34:41.541
Oh, well, then I'll be fast.

34:41.687 --> 34:43.563
Two words... You're welcome.

34:43.612 --> 34:44.974
What am I supposed to be
thanking you for?

34:45.022 --> 34:47.081
<i>Well, after doing a little</i>
<i>digging on your boy Jason,</i>

34:47.129 --> 34:48.619
<i>I found out he has a side hustle</i>

34:48.668 --> 34:50.208
working with the Southern Front.

34:50.299 --> 34:52.085
The same group of fine young folks

34:52.134 --> 34:53.681
that want your pal Oscar dead.

34:53.742 --> 34:55.547
Officer Nolan, the target has arrived.

34:55.596 --> 34:56.893
Sir, we may have a problem.

34:56.943 --> 34:58.692
Oscar, cut to the chase.
What did you do?

34:58.799 --> 35:00.355
Oh, fine. Ruin my story.

35:00.404 --> 35:01.556
Okay, upshot is,

35:01.604 --> 35:03.577
I think I found a solution
to both of our problems.

35:03.728 --> 35:04.877
<i>A few minutes ago,</i>

35:04.925 --> 35:06.922
<i>I had a little talk with a
Southern Front contact.</i>

35:06.971 --> 35:08.322
<i>I told them your boy Jason</i>

35:08.371 --> 35:09.533
was working with the cops

35:09.581 --> 35:11.218
<i>to rat them out, and in exchange,</i>

35:11.266 --> 35:12.637
<i>they lifted the hit on me,</i>

35:12.689 --> 35:13.974
<i>put one out on him.</i>

35:14.209 --> 35:15.324
Two birds,

35:15.372 --> 35:17.144
one shiv, huh?

35:18.299 --> 35:19.780
All units, the friendly's been made.

35:19.828 --> 35:21.148
Move in.

35:28.103 --> 35:29.420
How much we looking at?

35:30.087 --> 35:31.361
About two mil.

35:31.452 --> 35:33.039
Same accounts as last time?

35:39.648 --> 35:40.701
What?

35:44.139 --> 35:45.402
Is there a problem?

35:45.450 --> 35:47.247
Yeah. Apparently, it's you.

35:47.322 --> 35:48.787
- Okay.
- Police!

35:57.493 --> 35:59.345
Drop your weapons! Now!

36:01.027 --> 36:02.481
Cover me.

36:17.783 --> 36:19.248
Put it down!

36:19.358 --> 36:20.529
On the ground! Right now!

36:20.577 --> 36:21.979
Get down!

36:22.028 --> 36:23.682
<i>Get down, right now! On the ground!</i>

36:23.815 --> 36:25.235
Down!

37:03.298 --> 37:04.760
Let's go.

37:04.875 --> 37:06.696
You really don't wanna do this.

37:06.745 --> 37:07.998
Screw that.

37:08.047 --> 37:09.442
If I'm going back,

37:09.514 --> 37:11.746
I want to add "kicking your ass"
to the list of charges.

37:15.711 --> 37:17.298
You were saying?

37:20.899 --> 37:22.690
Hey.

37:22.739 --> 37:24.315
- I was hoping I'd catch you.
- You know what?

37:24.363 --> 37:25.803
It's been a really long day,
and I'm not sure

37:25.851 --> 37:27.548
how much more bad
news I can handle right now.

37:27.596 --> 37:30.246
- What if it's good news?
- Is this a joke?

37:30.295 --> 37:32.813
I convinced my boss
to a cut good deal for Tyler.

37:32.862 --> 37:34.086
Really?

37:34.135 --> 37:35.940
He won't be charged as an adult.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.052
He'll serve six months in juvie,

37:38.100 --> 37:39.720
then probation till he turns 18.

37:39.768 --> 37:41.255
That's a good deal.

37:41.303 --> 37:42.471
I know you think I'm a rookie,

37:42.519 --> 37:44.135
who doesn't
have the experience to do the job,

37:44.184 --> 37:45.637
but you should maybe give me a break.

37:45.784 --> 37:47.905
I actually think we're working
toward the same goal.

37:48.110 --> 37:50.120
Just coming at it
from different angles.

37:50.423 --> 37:52.967
Well, um, I appreciate
you making this happen.

37:53.074 --> 37:54.761
I appreciate you convincing me.

37:57.061 --> 37:58.548
Good night.

38:02.051 --> 38:03.621
So, I've been, uh...

38:03.669 --> 38:05.053
I've been thinking about your offer

38:05.101 --> 38:06.362
to do the show with me.

38:06.462 --> 38:08.583
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:08.916 --> 38:10.418
Look, if you can promise me

38:10.466 --> 38:11.628
that I'll have full control

38:11.676 --> 38:13.914
over the pieces of my
life that we expose, then...

38:14.215 --> 38:15.590
Yeah. I'll do it.

38:16.222 --> 38:17.322
Cut.

38:17.552 --> 38:19.506
- What's the problem?
- It sounds fake.

38:19.554 --> 38:21.028
- What does?
- You.

38:21.076 --> 38:22.885
Listen, if you want people
to watch this show,

38:22.934 --> 38:24.465
you gotta sound real.

38:24.513 --> 38:26.968
- You gotta be real.
- Yeah, listen to her, Aaron.

38:27.269 --> 38:28.436
Your mama's the queen of "real."

38:28.708 --> 38:30.205
Can I get a touch-up?!

38:30.419 --> 38:31.934
Let's get a touch-up.

38:35.983 --> 38:37.642
<i>You sure I can't
make you something?</i>

38:39.328 --> 38:40.982
I'm not really hungry.

38:42.952 --> 38:45.449
- Today sucked.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

38:45.598 --> 38:47.385
Big time.

38:48.247 --> 38:52.340
♪ I'm with you by your side ♪

38:52.526 --> 38:54.313
- ♪ By your side ♪
- Thank you.

38:54.510 --> 38:56.920
- For...?
- Everything.

38:57.606 --> 38:59.123
For all your help.

38:59.516 --> 39:01.310
For this bed.

39:02.478 --> 39:04.733
For getting justice for Becca.

39:05.434 --> 39:06.974
You did that.

39:09.658 --> 39:12.075
And thanks for helping me
leave it all behind,

39:12.247 --> 39:13.536
because if it weren't for you,

39:13.585 --> 39:16.540
I probably would have ended
up like Becca eventually.

39:17.023 --> 39:19.939
Well, you don't have to
worry about that anymore.

39:20.736 --> 39:22.396
You're safe.

39:24.958 --> 39:27.027
Do you wanna talk about
what you went through

39:27.076 --> 39:28.678
when you were living on the street?

39:28.811 --> 39:31.499
Um, not now, if that's okay.

39:31.547 --> 39:33.105
Yeah, we don't have
to talk about it now.

39:33.154 --> 39:34.989
You don't have to
talk about it with me.

39:35.084 --> 39:36.388
You know, but at some point,

39:36.444 --> 39:39.448
you might wanna talk to someone...

39:40.170 --> 39:41.876
Before it sneaks up on you.

39:44.093 --> 39:45.647
I will.

39:46.391 --> 39:47.651
I promise.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.711
Okay.

39:50.412 --> 39:51.852
Good night.

39:52.310 --> 39:53.967
Do you want this open or closed?

39:54.236 --> 39:56.003
Closed, please.

39:56.052 --> 39:58.940
- ♪ I'm with you by your side ♪
- Sweet dreams.

40:04.580 --> 40:05.967
You wanted to talk?

40:06.015 --> 40:07.592
Um, actually,

40:07.641 --> 40:09.135
I-I was hoping for

40:09.811 --> 40:12.219
more of a do-over. Um...

40:12.796 --> 40:15.064
I don't like how I handled it

40:15.113 --> 40:16.978
when you told me you were pregnant.

40:17.076 --> 40:18.576
Yeah, you didn't handle it.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.117
You didn't do anything, you just...

40:20.372 --> 40:22.483
- You just stood there.
- I know.

40:22.532 --> 40:25.068
Um, I can only plead

40:25.280 --> 40:26.919
temporary stupidity

40:26.968 --> 40:31.909
and throw myself at your mercy.

40:33.609 --> 40:34.895
Forgive me.

40:35.201 --> 40:36.597
Get up.

40:37.553 --> 40:40.248
- So, am I forgiven?
- Yes.

40:40.296 --> 40:41.402
Yes, get up.

40:43.116 --> 40:44.628
Look, look, um,

40:44.676 --> 40:46.007
I'm here, okay?

40:46.055 --> 40:48.507
I-I'm ready to listen.
I-I'm ready to talk.

40:49.105 --> 40:51.459
I'm ready to do
whatever it is you need.

40:51.553 --> 40:53.650
I need you to understand something.

40:54.265 --> 40:55.685
I made my peace,

40:55.898 --> 40:59.186
with not being able to
get pregnant again, and so,

40:59.234 --> 41:02.590
I never even allowed
myself to fantasize...

41:07.803 --> 41:09.588
I'm gonna have this baby.

41:13.649 --> 41:15.333
Well, then, um...

41:15.666 --> 41:20.116
you and I are going to
make a kick-ass team

41:20.901 --> 41:22.752
because we're gonna fight every day

41:22.801 --> 41:24.194
to make sure that this baby

41:24.243 --> 41:26.235
gets to live in a much better world

41:26.284 --> 41:27.737
than the one that exists right now.

41:28.534 --> 41:30.051
That's a good answer.

41:38.066 --> 41:39.252
There we go.

41:39.301 --> 41:41.128
The sommelier recommended this red.

41:41.410 --> 41:42.754
Sounds fancy.

41:42.803 --> 41:43.988
Yeah. Full disclosure,

41:44.036 --> 41:45.224
it was the guy at the liquor store.

41:45.273 --> 41:46.873
But he just said
everyone's buying this bottle.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.135
Thanks.

41:48.184 --> 41:49.403
A toast.

41:49.512 --> 41:51.667
To finally being able to exhale.

41:51.715 --> 41:53.769
Mm. Can we?

41:53.817 --> 41:55.137
Yes.

41:55.894 --> 41:59.374
Jason is behind bars for eight years,

41:59.422 --> 42:01.212
you have a divorce hearing
set for next month,

42:01.261 --> 42:03.335
and when your future
ex-husband finally gets out,

42:03.384 --> 42:05.418
- we'll get a restraining order.
- Mm.

42:05.467 --> 42:08.182
I really appreciate you
helping me through this mess.

42:08.577 --> 42:09.924
Anytime.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.394
Though, I confess, I,

42:12.442 --> 42:14.778
do find myself
wondering if there isn't yet,

42:14.826 --> 42:16.908
another crazed lunatic of a husband

42:16.957 --> 42:19.127
from your checkered past
lurking around out there.

42:19.175 --> 42:20.395
There isn't.

42:20.443 --> 42:22.231
What a relief. Evil twin?

42:22.279 --> 42:23.699
Triplets. Is that a problem?

42:24.612 --> 42:25.734
Triplets I can work with.
