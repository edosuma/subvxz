WEBVTT

00:34.451 --> 00:35.660
I think
I made a mistake.

00:35.701 --> 00:36.827
Why do you
have to finish it?

00:36.869 --> 00:38.245
You answer me please.

00:39.121 --> 00:39.997
Just answer me.

00:40.039 --> 00:40.832
Why do you have to finish it?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.335
You can't come to your...

00:43.375 --> 00:44.210
To your...

00:46.128 --> 00:47.756
Jess, I
love you most, okay?

02:19.222 --> 02:20.724
Please, someone.

02:21.724 --> 02:26.186
Anyone, if you know anything
about her disappearance.

03:14.818 --> 03:16.236
What's up, minions?

03:16.278 --> 03:18.740
DropTheMike here at the
Pasadena suicide bridge.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.450
How awesome is this?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.377
In 1913, the bridge
was built and since then,

03:31.419 --> 03:34.673
100 people have leapt
to their deaths,

03:34.713 --> 03:36.841
the most famous of
which is Myrtle Ward.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.552
Myrtle Ward is famous for
having tossed her infant

03:39.593 --> 03:43.347
off this bridge and
jumping shortly thereafter

03:43.389 --> 03:46.350
so that they could spend the
afterlife together forever.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.310
Isn't that sweet?

03:47.352 --> 03:49.896
In a remarkable twist
of fate, thick branches

03:49.937 --> 03:52.022
slowed the infant's
fall to the ground

03:52.064 --> 03:53.733
and it landed mostly unharmed.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.528
Myrtle wasn't so lucky
though and people say

03:56.568 --> 03:58.947
that you can still hear
her ghost wandering

03:58.987 --> 04:00.448
beneath the bridge at night,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.826
searching for her newborn child.

04:04.326 --> 04:05.286
All right, guys.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.579
That's it for this installation.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.248
I am DropTheMike,

04:09.081 --> 04:10.500
subscribe to my channel.

04:10.542 --> 04:14.753
I post sick and twisted
new videos every other...

04:21.636 --> 04:22.595
What's up, minions?

04:22.637 --> 04:24.055
It's DropTheMike here.

04:24.096 --> 04:26.390
Some of you sick bastards
have been asking me

04:26.432 --> 04:28.058
for special behind
the scenes extras.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.353
Well follow me this way,

04:30.394 --> 04:31.937
if you dare.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.480
This is my little baby.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.941
Little J Dahmer.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.278
Hey, hey, do your impersonation
of a strangulation victim.

04:40.362 --> 04:41.488
Mwah.

04:41.531 --> 04:45.576
And right over here is my always
effervescent fiance, Jess.

04:45.617 --> 04:48.579
Say hi to the multitudes, baby.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.789
All right as you can see,
Jess is an incredibly talented

04:50.831 --> 04:51.915
artist right over here.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.878
She's also a nurse on the
west side of Los Angeles.

04:54.918 --> 04:57.046
A truly noble career path
if I do say so myself,

04:57.088 --> 04:58.131
unlike yours truly.

04:58.173 --> 05:02.052
Hey, so my followers have
a few questions for you.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.093
Wanna answer them?

05:03.136 --> 05:03.927
Yes, you do.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.763
Yes, you do.

05:04.803 --> 05:05.596
Oh, come on, come on,

05:05.637 --> 05:07.097
don't do this to me.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.308
Loosecanon99 wants to know

05:10.476 --> 05:13.020
do you approve of
what Mike does?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.481
Ugh,

05:15.523 --> 05:16.775
no.

05:16.815 --> 05:18.942
I haven't seen one of
his films in a while.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.072
They're just unsettling
for my taste, you know?

05:22.112 --> 05:26.492
But he loves what he does and
it keeps him off drugs, so.

05:26.533 --> 05:27.326
So she thinks.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.161
Okay, get out of here.

05:28.202 --> 05:28.994
I got work to do.

05:29.036 --> 05:30.454
Ow!

05:30.497 --> 05:31.538
Ladies and gentlemen and
everything in between,

05:31.581 --> 05:32.956
this is my inner sanctum.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.377
This is where my wicked
brew is concocted

05:35.418 --> 05:37.795
and the witch stirring
the visual pot

05:37.836 --> 05:40.339
is none other than my editor
and occasional cohort,

05:40.382 --> 05:41.507
the amazing Nic.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.387
Say hi to the minions, Nic.

05:46.553 --> 05:48.013
She loves me.

05:48.055 --> 05:50.974
After each shoot, the DP and
I unload all of our video

05:51.016 --> 05:53.478
and sound cards to her
and she has carte blanche

05:53.519 --> 05:54.478
to edit them as she sees fit.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.855
And of course, last but
not deceased,

05:56.898 --> 05:59.401
is my DP, which is
Director of Photography

05:59.442 --> 06:01.694
for your idiots out there,
and very best friend.

06:01.735 --> 06:03.153
The one and only Christopher.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.781
Hey, Chris, turn the
camera around and show them

06:04.822 --> 06:06.490
your ugly mug, okay?

06:08.867 --> 06:09.827
Gotcha, didn't I?

06:09.869 --> 06:11.788
No, this is not Christopher.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.831
This is Fred the Head.

06:13.872 --> 06:15.082
He's great, isn't he?

06:15.125 --> 06:15.959
Okay, Chris, we
can show you now.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.420
Okay give me the camera, good.

06:16.999 --> 06:18.461
We can introduce you.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.670
Separated at birth?

06:19.713 --> 06:20.672
I think so.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.839
You're such a dick.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.632
Stop!

06:23.675 --> 06:24.634
Talk about good head,

06:24.675 --> 06:25.509
right, friend?

06:25.552 --> 06:26.343
Stop, Nic!

06:26.386 --> 06:27.429
God, will you guys
get out of here?

06:27.470 --> 06:28.430
Oh, Jesus Christ.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.680
I'm gonna cut...

06:36.562 --> 06:37.896
What's up, minions?

06:37.939 --> 06:40.191
Okay, really, all
joking aside, I just had

06:40.233 --> 06:42.485
an incredible phone call
with the super popular

06:42.526 --> 06:43.610
clothing store, Haute Gothic.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.865
They just told me that if I
can get 50,000 subscribers

06:46.906 --> 06:49.199
by the end of Halloween weekend,
they're gonna sponsor me

06:49.242 --> 06:51.076
a whopping $250,000.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.831
That is 250 grand, people!

06:54.872 --> 06:56.040
It's incredible.

06:56.081 --> 06:57.459
Okay, so this is
where you come in.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.502
I need you to comment
below and tell me

06:59.543 --> 07:01.503
what horrifying locations
you think I should do

07:01.545 --> 07:04.007
a super scary Halloween
edition vlog, okay?

07:04.048 --> 07:05.632
It's gonna be sick.

07:06.634 --> 07:10.555
If you don't do it, Fred
the Head will be so sad.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.431
Love you guys and
I'll see you later.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.058
DropTheMike out.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.609
What's up, minions?

07:23.651 --> 07:25.069
Bet you're wondering
what I'm doing

07:25.110 --> 07:27.488
in this seemingly peaceful
middle class street.

07:27.529 --> 07:28.655
Sweet costume, dude.

07:28.697 --> 07:30.532
Uh, excuse me,
I'm Michael Myers.

07:30.574 --> 07:33.495
I may look like a troll
doll, but I'm Michael Myers.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.913
Many people don't know
this, but real life

07:35.954 --> 07:38.165
serial killer David
Olmos dumped one

07:38.208 --> 07:41.252
of this many victims' dead
bodies in this street.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.837
It was in this exact spot
that the neighbors found

07:43.879 --> 07:47.257
her dismembered body in a
trash can the next morning.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.593
Oh my God, Chris.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.760
Chris.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.178
She's still here.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.971
Oh, it was too soon.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.598
She was so innocent, it's so...

07:54.641 --> 07:56.518
oh, that feels real good.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.603
Oh, this wig is real itchy.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.730
Anyways, two weeks ago, I
asked you guys to tell me

08:01.773 --> 08:03.608
where you thought
that I should shoot

08:03.649 --> 08:06.735
my Halloween vlog coming up,
sponsored by Haute Gothic.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.237
Shhh.

08:08.278 --> 08:10.197
The response was overwhelming
I couldn't believe

08:10.240 --> 08:13.576
how much you guys wanted to
see me at the winning location,

08:13.617 --> 08:15.954
which is the Lenox Hotel.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.790
Per your requests, I'm gonna
be spending the entirety

08:18.831 --> 08:20.541
of Halloween weekend
there with my crew.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.128
The hotel happens to be where
Night Crawler, David Olmos,

08:23.168 --> 08:25.963
lived and is also where
a tourist, Meghan Kim,

08:26.005 --> 08:28.757
famous for her elevator
video recently met

08:28.800 --> 08:30.259
her untimely demise.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.135
We're shooting the
entirety of the vlog there.

08:32.177 --> 08:34.221
And we have an expert
here to tell us more

08:34.264 --> 08:36.015
about this petrifying place.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.975
That person is.

08:38.018 --> 08:42.105
My friend and haunted hotel
historian, Wallace Fleischer,

08:42.147 --> 08:45.525
author of the book "The
Many Curses of Hotel Lenox."

08:45.567 --> 08:47.652
Please join me in
welcoming the one and only,

08:47.693 --> 08:50.863
the singular sensation,
Wallace Fleischer.

08:50.904 --> 08:52.031
Good evening, sire.

08:52.072 --> 08:53.198
Thank you very much.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.534
I'm not gonna kiss your hand,
you're not wearing a ring.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.327
But Wallace, thank you
very much for having us

08:57.370 --> 08:59.038
into your home today,
we appreciate it.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.331
You're more than
welcome, Mike.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.542
Hi, Chris.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.500
Hi, Wallace.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.671
So why did you write
about Hotel Lenox?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.798
I began to understand
why it was so frightening

09:08.840 --> 09:12.677
after I learned more
about its sordid history.

09:13.595 --> 09:17.307
The Hotel Lenox is
downtown LA near where

09:17.349 --> 09:18.767
Skid Row area is.

09:18.807 --> 09:20.851
They changed the name
of the hotel many times

09:20.894 --> 09:24.188
over the years because of
its very bad reputation,

09:24.230 --> 09:26.858
especially what happened
a few months ago

09:26.899 --> 09:29.860
with the hotel, which
I'll go into in a moment.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.863
It was built in 1927,

09:31.904 --> 09:33.072
there were 123

09:35.240 --> 09:38.870
people who were either
murdered or killed themselves

09:38.912 --> 09:40.080
in this hotel.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.126
Now, the infamous David Olmos.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.378
Ah, yes.

09:46.418 --> 09:47.879
- The Night Crawler.
- The Night Crawler.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.633
He stayed on the
14th floor in 1985.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.093
Managed to murder 14 people.

09:54.134 --> 09:58.306
He lured people into his
room, mostly prostitutes,

09:59.014 --> 10:01.393
which then he would dismember.

10:01.433 --> 10:04.395
But not before he had completely
stripped their bodies,

10:04.437 --> 10:08.774
tortured them, and had sex
with their dead bodies.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.903
The neighbors, they'd heard
this humming sound at night

10:12.946 --> 10:15.699
of the electric hacksaw
but they didn't know

10:15.740 --> 10:18.243
what it was for so no
one ever said anything.

10:18.283 --> 10:19.119
Wow!

10:20.370 --> 10:21.870
A devil worshiper.

10:21.913 --> 10:22.831
How cliche.

10:24.289 --> 10:29.169
Yes, that's a
satanic symbol of Babylon.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.338
Follow Satan, you will.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.049
So all joking aside,

10:35.134 --> 10:36.427
could you tell us what happened

10:36.469 --> 10:38.138
to David Olmos?

10:38.178 --> 10:40.973
Well, he cut his
throat in jail.

10:42.182 --> 10:44.686
Wow, I think this sets
the stage beautifully.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.937
I wanna thank Wallace
Fleischer for enlightening us

10:46.980 --> 10:48.188
on the hotel's history.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.316
Thank you very much
for your time, Wallace.

10:50.357 --> 10:53.360
And be sure to keep
track of us as we gear up

10:53.403 --> 10:55.113
for our three nights
at the Hotel Lenox,

10:55.154 --> 10:56.113
we'll be posting

10:56.155 --> 10:57.072
- our vlogs beforehand...
- Wait.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.451
You're not staying there?

10:59.491 --> 11:01.452
You're not
gonna listen to a thing

11:01.494 --> 11:02.870
Wallace has to say, are you?

11:02.912 --> 11:05.123
About not staying
at the hotel?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.081
Are you kidding me?

11:06.124 --> 11:08.793
Dude, it's ooga booga nonsense.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.795
You know, there's no
such thing as spirits,

11:10.836 --> 11:12.129
and ghosts, and blah blah blah.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.673
You do a
vlog about spirits,

11:14.716 --> 11:15.924
and ghosts, and blah blah blah.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.468
Yeah, I also
watch horror movies.

11:17.509 --> 11:18.970
That doesn't mean that
I believe in everything

11:19.011 --> 11:21.055
that I see in them.

11:21.096 --> 11:23.140
I don't know, man.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.059
I don't think we
should do this one.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.144
Seriously?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.312
Are you kidding me?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.980
Give me the camera.

11:29.022 --> 11:29.855
God.

11:31.231 --> 11:32.817
What a pussy.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.069
Look at yourself.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.071
I mean, we have been to
so many different places

11:36.111 --> 11:37.447
where terrible
things have happened.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.824
Are you seriously
gonna ditch the vlog

11:39.865 --> 11:40.908
over one hotel?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.243
This is different.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.161
How?

11:44.203 --> 11:48.707
The other places we shot
outside, we never went in them.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.125
What?

11:50.168 --> 11:52.044
Inside, outside, what
difference does that even make?

11:52.086 --> 11:53.129
I'm look, sorry.

11:53.171 --> 11:53.963
I'm sorry, okay?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.215
No, this is great.

11:55.255 --> 11:57.257
This is exactly why
I keep you around

11:57.299 --> 12:00.511
for this Catholic-y,
pope-y nonsense

12:00.552 --> 12:02.514
that you were raised on.

12:02.554 --> 12:03.931
It's a nice, new perspective.

12:03.972 --> 12:06.392
But seriously, okay,
you were brainwashed

12:06.433 --> 12:09.062
by some pastor, or
priest, or whatever

12:09.104 --> 12:11.022
who had dressed up in their
nice, little robe costume,

12:11.063 --> 12:13.065
preaching these ideas
to you so that they...

12:13.107 --> 12:14.733
It's not made up!

12:15.818 --> 12:17.236
I've seen ghosts.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.740
I've seen evil spirits.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.081
Seriously, chill out, I...

12:28.123 --> 12:29.499
I wanna know, okay?

12:29.541 --> 12:31.292
Just talk to me, man.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.879
I was 10 years old.

12:39.591 --> 12:42.220
I looked in the bathroom
and there's this

12:42.261 --> 12:44.763
kid standing in the doorway.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.807
His right hand,

12:47.433 --> 12:49.852
he's holding this tabby cat

12:51.937 --> 12:52.938
from a noose.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.571
He drops this cat and
it starts running at me

12:59.611 --> 13:00.904
and it's like, scratching

13:00.947 --> 13:02.865
and clawing at my face.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
I was blinded but I,

13:08.120 --> 13:10.331
I finally reached
the light switch

13:10.373 --> 13:15.253
and by the time I turned
it on, they were both gone.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.048
I called my mom the next
day and I told her to come

13:18.089 --> 13:21.009
pick me up and get
me out of there.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.806
Wow, dude, that's terrible.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.560
That's the most terrible
fucking story I've ever heard

13:31.602 --> 13:32.978
in my entire life.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.813
I mean, a fucking
tabby cat in a noose

13:34.855 --> 13:38.025
ran at you and attacked
you in the face?

13:38.067 --> 13:38.985
Are you kidding me?

13:39.027 --> 13:40.110
I mean, come on.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.363
Think about this, okay?

13:41.403 --> 13:43.990
It is always when people
are falling asleep,

13:44.032 --> 13:46.076
halfway between
awake and sleeping,

13:46.116 --> 13:48.535
they are ramping into
REM cycle and their mind

13:48.577 --> 13:49.953
plays tricks on them...

13:49.995 --> 13:50.913
What about the
scratches on my face?

13:50.955 --> 13:51.956
Dude, your own fingernails.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.458
Come on, Einstein.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.958
You know, it's nice to
know that the only two people

13:55.999 --> 13:56.627
I've ever told this
to, you and my mother,

13:56.669 --> 13:58.879
don't believe me.

13:58.922 --> 13:59.964
Dude, seriously.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.800
That cat and
that kid were real.

14:02.841 --> 14:03.634
Yeah, okay.

14:03.677 --> 14:04.635
Sure, whatever.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.932
I'm not doing Hotel
Lenox, man, there's no way.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.184
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

14:11.225 --> 14:12.184
Yes,

14:12.226 --> 14:14.645
you are, all right?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.064
Tune in next week to find
out if pussy Christopher here

14:17.106 --> 14:18.149
grew a pair of testicles.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.984
Shut up, Michael!

14:23.697 --> 14:25.322
Okay, guys.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.866
So pussy Christopher threw a
wrench in the works last night.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.662
Now, I could hire a new DP
for Halloween weekend but

14:30.703 --> 14:33.038
he and I know each others'
work rhythms and we've been

14:33.081 --> 14:34.499
working together
since high school.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.375
So...

14:36.543 --> 14:39.294
so, I'm gonna try
a different tactic.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.007
Danni, that you?

14:43.091 --> 14:43.883
Mike?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.509
The one and only.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.469
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:46.510 --> 14:48.012
Do you got a second?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.514
Oh gentle, gentle, Jesus.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.349
Oh God, that thing
does not work well, does it?

14:51.390 --> 14:52.516
Yeah.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.101
Okay, I gotcha,
I gotcha, I gotcha.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.352
Wow, looking good.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.478
So what are you
doing down there?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.397
You know the sound makes
when you drive a car, that

14:59.274 --> 15:00.482
Uh, sure.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.942
I was recording it
for a friend's short.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.028
- Okay, I see, yeah.
- Don't ask.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.030
Hey, look, I need
you Halloween weekend.

15:06.072 --> 15:06.947
Can you turn that off?

15:06.990 --> 15:07.865
No, I'm a vlogger.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.492
Look, I just need you
to do third camera,

15:09.533 --> 15:11.119
some backup sound.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.037
Okay, what's the hitch?

15:13.078 --> 15:13.912
What are
you talking about?

15:13.955 --> 15:15.165
There's always a
hitch with you, Mike.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.959
Okay, it's in a hotel
that the unenlightened claims

15:18.999 --> 15:19.001
is mildly haunted.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.336
And?

15:20.378 --> 15:21.629
And I need
you to get Christopher

15:21.671 --> 15:22.629
to do the shoot with us.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.630
Oh.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.466
Yeah, no, that's...

15:24.506 --> 15:25.299
Look, look.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.216
Christopher likes you.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.969
Okay, he more than likes you.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.553
Thank you for that.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.722
So you wanna capitalize on our
friendship and his feelings.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.639
That's just great.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.060
Just three
days and three nights.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.687
Okay, I'll give
you scale plus 200.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.439
That means 200 a day.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.648
Okay, send me the details.

15:40.690 --> 15:41.566
Yes!

15:41.607 --> 15:42.399
And a contract.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.234
Of course, always.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.485
Only the best for you.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.653
That's why you're my favorite.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.762
So I just got off the phone
with the Hotel Lenox's manager.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.264
She said we absolutely
cannot shoot there

16:13.306 --> 16:14.557
under any conditions.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.434
The hotel's gotten
a lot of bad press

16:16.475 --> 16:18.186
since the Meghan
Kim elevator video

16:18.227 --> 16:20.270
and Meghan Kim's family
is now suing them.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.316
So I don't know, I guess
I just gotta give up.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.109
Just kidding, fuck it.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.194
As you can see, we've decided
to shoot at the hotel anyways.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.115
So we're packing all of
our gear into suitcases

16:30.155 --> 16:31.115
to disguise ourselves
as tourists.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.783
We're also gonna be wearing
hats and other things

16:32.826 --> 16:34.661
so that people
can't recognize us.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.371
And what's special
about this vlog is,

16:37.413 --> 16:39.790
we're gonna have Nic
on set editing live.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.418
How you feeling about that, Nic?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.627
Oh you know,
absolute thrilled.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.628
Yes, you are.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.506
She's going to be
posting videos throughout

16:46.548 --> 16:47.673
Halloween night so
you've gotta make sure

16:47.716 --> 16:51.010
that you see them before the
hotel yanks 'em, all right?

16:51.052 --> 16:55.348
And we are so excited
to have Danni on board.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.807
Yay!

16:56.850 --> 16:57.850
Hey, Danni, do you really
think that there are

16:57.892 --> 17:00.270
evil spirits waiting in
the hotel, ready to pounce?

17:00.311 --> 17:01.604
Pretty sure the only
thing waiting to pounce

17:01.645 --> 17:02.563
is bed bugs, Mike.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.480
That's disgusting.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.026
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and

17:06.067 --> 17:07.652
we're welcoming
back into the fold

17:07.693 --> 17:09.111
the one and only Christ-opher.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.030
The only reason I'm
doing this is because

17:11.070 --> 17:13.073
I'm $500 shy on rent.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.701
Yeah, uh-huh, sure.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.662
So Chris, why don't
you tell our sycophants

17:17.703 --> 17:20.830
about some of the amazing gear
that you've brought with us?

17:20.874 --> 17:22.709
We've got a couple
of security cams here,

17:22.750 --> 17:26.337
spy cam, set up with
a button, and hat cam.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.338
Oh, that's sick.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.590
Where's the lens?

17:28.631 --> 17:31.176
The lens is the left
eye of the smiley face.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.178
Oh, that's sick.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.471
If that's not cool enough,
we got a drone packed up

17:35.512 --> 17:36.305
and ready to go.

17:36.347 --> 17:37.222
Oh, no way.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.725
That's so millennial of us.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.727
Hey, Chris, can I borrow
that for my next sex tape?

17:40.769 --> 17:42.519
I heard that.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.271
Everybody, will you
please just be careful?

17:44.314 --> 17:47.484
I don't want any of you ending
up in the ER, all right?

17:47.525 --> 17:48.692
Kiss her!

17:48.734 --> 17:49.693
Shush!

17:49.736 --> 17:50.987
All right, come on.

17:51.028 --> 17:51.820
Oh hey, hey, one
more for camera.

17:51.863 --> 17:52.864
One more for camera.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.822
Come on, come on.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.075
There it is.

17:55.115 --> 17:55.950
Get.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.163
That was a little taste
for those of you out there

18:00.204 --> 18:02.539
who can't get any action,
which is most of you.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.502
Anyways, we're headed
to downtown Los Angeles.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.377
Ooh.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.464
This is your co-pilot, Michael.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.717
We are now entering the first
layer of Dante's Inferno,

18:12.759 --> 18:15.553
please make sure that your
seats are in their full upright

18:15.595 --> 18:17.639
and missionary position.

18:17.681 --> 18:18.890
Hey,

18:18.932 --> 18:22.727
grab my phone charger
out of there, will you?

18:22.769 --> 18:23.560
What the...

18:24.561 --> 18:25.562
Yes!

18:25.605 --> 18:26.397
Motherfu...

18:26.439 --> 18:27.565
I spring loaded it.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.608
Yeah,
tricked the trickster.

18:29.651 --> 18:30.735
Well played, Slim Shady.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.278
But just so you know,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.572
payback's a bitch.

18:52.632 --> 18:57.262
The nice part of downtown's
just two blocks away.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.264
It's feast or famine down here.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.267
Check this guy out.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.144
Nic, give him $50 and
maybe he'll do a backflip.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.519
Jesus!

19:05.561 --> 19:07.271
Ow.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.691
Does anybody know
why they put those gargoyles

19:09.732 --> 19:11.275
on the side of
buildings like that?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.153
It's to ward off evil.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.447
Actually, they are there
to prevent the rainwater

19:16.489 --> 19:18.950
from falling down
the masonary walls.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.326
Wow, Nic.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.538
Throwing out
knowledge sans Google.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.624
I'm telling you,
it's to ward off evil.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.336
I think I'm gonna go with
Nic on this one, buddy.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.461
Sorry.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.587
There she is.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.299
Can you feel the
love, Christopher?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.634
No, it
looks creepy already.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.471
I don't see
any gargoyles up there.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.932
Hmm, not cool.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.309
Hey, do you
guys see that boy there?

19:50.022 --> 19:50.939
Oh!
What the...

19:50.981 --> 19:52.649
Okay.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.859
Hey, dude.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.028
I don't need my
windshield cleaned.

19:55.069 --> 19:55.861
It's fine.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.279
You have change?

19:57.321 --> 19:58.364
I don't have
any change on me.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.365
We don't have any money
in here, I'm sorry, dude.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.616
A dollar's fine.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.742
Dude, you
need to just leave.

20:01.785 --> 20:02.826
I don't have
anything, I'm sorry.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.660
You don't have to be
an asshole about it.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.495
Whoa.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.372
You're the asshole, dude.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.373
I hope you die!

20:07.915 --> 20:11.586
Did that homeless dude
just tell me to die?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.003
Alrighty, my minions.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.840
From here on out,
we are rolling 24/7.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.509
We take a dump, it
better be on camera.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.510
Great.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.969
My ass can end up as a meme.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.388
Whoa!

20:23.347 --> 20:24.348
What's up, dude?

20:24.391 --> 20:26.267
Weird deja vu moment.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.685
Glitch in the matrix?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.561
Yeah.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.875
All right, the same elevator
Meghan Kim was last seen in

20:51.917 --> 20:53.752
before she disappeared.

20:53.795 --> 20:54.754
Creepsville.

20:54.796 --> 20:55.922
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.923
These are the buttons
she pushed, too.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.592
Hey, why are we
going up to 14?

21:00.634 --> 21:01.760
You'll see.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.307
Here we are.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.893
It's not as
horrible as I thought.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.936
Only the finest for
my fine, fine crew.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.355
Oh, please.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.398
The receptionist
said some of the floors

21:14.441 --> 21:15.442
are nicer than others.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.442
The rest of them...

21:16.483 --> 21:18.068
Rat-infested hell holes.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.403
Yeah, pretty much.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.237
For like low income locals

21:20.279 --> 21:22.031
and backpackers
and such, anyways.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.783
All right, so Nic.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.785
You are in room 1426.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.414
Guys,

21:30.457 --> 21:31.750
give her peace.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.958
She needs to edit.

21:33.999 --> 21:34.418
Break legs, guys.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.295
Literally.

21:36.962 --> 21:37.922
And us.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.049
Guys, we're in room 1428.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.596
Why is he so
excited about this?

21:44.636 --> 21:46.388
This does not
bode well for us.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.350
Well I told you guys
I had a surprise, right?

21:48.391 --> 21:49.726
This is your present.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.394
This is the room where,

21:52.979 --> 21:55.315
where David Olmos lived when
he murdered those 14 people.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.316
You're kidding?

21:56.357 --> 21:57.274
Really?

21:57.317 --> 21:58.442
Dude, there's no way
I'm staying in there.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.693
Yes, you are.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.072
No, I'm not staying in
David's death dungeon.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.615
Dude, that was
like, 30 years ago.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.450
Stop being such a pussy.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.909
I resent that pussy comment.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.411
Why is it guys always
say that when someone's

22:08.452 --> 22:09.620
not being brave enough?

22:09.662 --> 22:10.997
It's not a
question of being brave.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.414
Yes, it is.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.417
As in, they're
female-like, meaning

22:14.459 --> 22:15.710
they're less than
they should be.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.086
It's not a question
of bravery here,

22:17.127 --> 22:19.129
it's a question of
being stupid or not.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.382
Okay, look it.

22:20.423 --> 22:21.965
It's a room, all right?

22:22.008 --> 22:25.095
There is no scientific
data that evil spirits lurk

22:25.135 --> 22:26.261
in physical spaces, all right?

22:26.304 --> 22:29.474
It's what you bring into it
psychologically that matters

22:29.516 --> 22:31.058
so let's go.

22:31.101 --> 22:32.268
Thank you.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.979
Okay, I want to retract my
previous demeaning statement

22:35.020 --> 22:36.397
about the female gender.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.566
Chris, you need to amp
up the pussy power.

22:38.607 --> 22:39.567
Right.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.901
Yeah!

22:40.943 --> 22:42.111
Dude, come on.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.364
Hello?

22:52.705 --> 22:53.997
Nic, can
I stay with you?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.500
I'll set my cot
up in the corner.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.002
Come on.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.004
Come on.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.131
Come on, it's amazing.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.133
All right, I claim this bed.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.843
You can sleep with
your boyfriend, Mike.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.969
Mm, perfect.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.680
We're gonna snuggle so much.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.432
Hey Chris, can I get
like, an interview shot

23:11.473 --> 23:13.100
of you with the
bathroom really quickly.

23:13.143 --> 23:14.602
'Cause you're a piece of shit.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.104
Ha ha.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.397
Okay, Chris,
how does it feel to stand

23:18.440 --> 23:20.066
in the bathroom where
David Olmos dismembered

23:20.107 --> 23:21.900
all those bodies?

23:21.942 --> 23:23.153
Awesome.

23:23.193 --> 23:25.946
I can take a poop
in peace later.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.490
Thanks, that's all I wanted.

23:29.701 --> 23:30.660
Hey, actually, will
you grab me a water

23:30.701 --> 23:32.412
from the mini bar?

23:37.083 --> 23:37.875
Amazing.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.543
Jerk!

23:39.586 --> 23:42.422
You got me with Fred the Head.

23:42.463 --> 23:43.464
Wait, wait, wait.

23:43.506 --> 23:44.716
Wait.

23:44.758 --> 23:47.969
He's gonna be our
own little gargoyle.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.471
He'll ward off the
evil spirits, you know?

23:50.512 --> 23:52.557
Oh yeah, if anything,
he'll tow them

23:52.598 --> 23:54.516
right to our room like the
Death Star's tractor beam.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.976
You're
such a fucking nerd.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.979
Okay, guys, we
gotta get geared up.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.938
We're losing light so we
wanna get some more exteriors

23:59.980 --> 24:00.773
before that happens.

24:00.815 --> 24:01.982
All right?

24:02.025 --> 24:02.817
Over and
out the door, guys.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.526
What's up, minions.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.738
DropTheMike here behind the
creepy deepy Hotel Lenox.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.239
We are in one of its
many back alleys.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.656
Watch out for the
street juice, Chris,

24:09.699 --> 24:11.076
it's pretty disgusting.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.161
Right here is the
dumpster where David Olmos

24:13.202 --> 24:15.120
would dump his
dismembered bodies.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.163
Sweet, baby!

24:17.582 --> 24:18.625
Oh!

24:19.625 --> 24:20.668
Excuse me, miss.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.671
Would you mind if I interview
you for my documentary?

24:22.711 --> 24:24.213
Mind if I ask your name?

24:24.255 --> 24:25.131
Hey, guys.

24:25.173 --> 24:28.550
Check out our
neighborhood drug dealer.

24:28.593 --> 24:29.635
Oh, shit.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.638
Guys?

24:31.680 --> 24:32.555
Guys.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.431
Oh, okay.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.264
What are you
fucking recording?

24:34.307 --> 24:35.557
Get back here!

24:38.811 --> 24:39.603
Hey who
was that, Danni?

24:39.645 --> 24:40.771
One of your exes?

24:40.814 --> 24:41.730
So funny, I thought
it was your pimp.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.524
Not funny, guys.

24:43.566 --> 24:44.358
Welcome back, kids.

24:44.401 --> 24:46.611
Once again, we're
in the Hotel Lenox.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.278
And right now, I'm
walking down the hallway

24:48.320 --> 24:50.072
where serial killer David Olmos

24:50.115 --> 24:53.076
would sneak to this
very fire escape.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.827
Am I
following you on this?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.161
Yeah, of course
you're following me.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.248
Why are we friends
with this guy?

24:58.288 --> 24:59.081
Are you coming?

24:59.124 --> 24:59.915
Yeah.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.750
Come on.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.169
It's here that David
Olmos would perform

25:04.211 --> 25:07.089
his satanic rituals before
heading out into the city

25:07.132 --> 25:08.258
to find his next victim.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.720
How unbelievably
awesome is that.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.928
Whoa.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.596
Mike, check out this poor guy.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.682
Oh, somebody is not
having a good day.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.976
Toto, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

25:19.019 --> 25:20.269
Bad omen, dude.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.146
Hey, did
you pack the drone?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.273
It's in the pack.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.775
All right, let's unload
the cards from tonight.

25:25.817 --> 25:28.611
Nic'll take care of it
then we can rig our room

25:28.653 --> 25:30.654
with night cams and then
get a good night's sleep

25:30.696 --> 25:32.031
and start fresh in the morning.

25:32.073 --> 25:33.324
A good night's
sleep in this place.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.242
Are you high?

25:35.285 --> 25:36.119
Nut attack.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:21.623 --> 26:25.125
So this, my friends,
is a 45nm blacklight

26:25.167 --> 26:26.377
that I got for like $100 online.

26:26.419 --> 26:29.631
It's gonna pick up any bad
energy that might be in the room.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.384
Meghan Kim's coming for ya.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.051
All right.

26:34.094 --> 26:37.889
I think though there's
any blood in here either.

26:37.931 --> 26:40.725
What we need is one
of those ghostbuster lights.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.602
Oh man, look at that
creepy little vent

26:42.644 --> 26:43.435
above the sink.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.230
I bet this is where
they could smell

26:45.270 --> 26:47.648
Meghan Kim's body burning.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.027
Maybe I should shove some
shish kabobs in there.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.028
Oh wait,
hold on a second.

26:52.069 --> 26:53.237
What?

26:54.446 --> 26:56.699
Did you hear that?

27:07.751 --> 27:09.753
Christopher,
I'm coming to get you.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.088
I'm crawling up the vent.

27:11.131 --> 27:12.298
Shut up, Mike!

27:12.339 --> 27:13.257
Dude, there's
nothing in there.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.091
Come on.

27:14.968 --> 27:15.969
How's it going, Nicolai?

27:16.010 --> 27:16.970
Buzz off.

27:17.011 --> 27:17.803
I'm working.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.263
That's my girl.

27:20.265 --> 27:22.392
You know this is gonna
be like trying to sleep

27:22.433 --> 27:24.351
in a graveyard.

27:24.394 --> 27:26.270
Would cuddling
make you feel bett...

27:26.311 --> 27:27.271
Hey!

27:27.313 --> 27:28.440
- Don't touch.
- Fuck, dude.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.273
I thought you were
gonna punch me.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.316
Save room or Jesus.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.860
Danni.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.946
I think little Chrissy
Wissy needs a lullaby.

27:34.988 --> 27:36.322
Know any?

27:36.364 --> 27:37.699
Pwease, Danni?

27:40.492 --> 27:41.785
Yeah!

27:41.827 --> 27:44.204
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

27:44.247 --> 27:48.293
♪ Rock a bye baby
in the tree tops ♪

27:48.335 --> 27:52.087
♪ And down will come
baby cradle and all ♪

27:52.130 --> 27:54.257
Down will come
baby, cradle and all?

27:54.298 --> 27:55.466
That's supposed to comfort me?

27:55.508 --> 27:58.260
Dude, children's
stories are fucked up.

27:58.303 --> 27:59.304
Wait, that
is really terrifying.

27:59.346 --> 28:01.388
I never thought about that.

28:01.431 --> 28:03.350
Hey, whatcha got there?

28:05.477 --> 28:06.311
Anxiety.

28:07.479 --> 28:10.148
Are you
still on those?

28:10.190 --> 28:11.231
Yep.

28:11.273 --> 28:16.028
I've actually got my
little ambies right here.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.490
This shit fucks you up.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.200
Man, you
guys are a mess.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.201
Fuck you.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.495
Uh, guys.

28:24.537 --> 28:28.333
I know I joke around a lot and
shit but I just wanted to say

28:28.375 --> 28:29.750
barricade!

28:31.336 --> 28:33.505
This is why I
wanted my own bed!

28:33.546 --> 28:34.963
Come to me, my children!

28:35.006 --> 28:36.257
I'm gonna fart,
I'm gonna fart.

28:36.298 --> 28:37.133
- Don't fart!
- I will squash you

28:37.174 --> 28:38.134
with the pillow.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.426
I shall squash you.

28:39.469 --> 28:41.846
Oh, I farted so
bad right on Chris.

28:42.888 --> 28:43.681
Did you set an alarm?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.515
Yeah.

28:44.557 --> 28:45.642
Okay.

28:45.683 --> 28:46.475
Night, guys.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.812
Goodnight.

28:53.441 --> 28:57.528
Mike, get your
hand off of my butt!

28:57.569 --> 28:59.196
Did you guys hear that?

28:59.239 --> 29:00.155
That's not funny.

29:00.198 --> 29:01.865
No, seriously.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.826
Oh fuck, Fred fell.

29:03.867 --> 29:04.868
Oh no.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.663
Hang on, I got it.

29:06.704 --> 29:07.496
That's creepy.

29:07.538 --> 29:10.125
How did you fall, dude?

30:17.858 --> 30:20.110
We're heading down to the
basement where Meghan Kim's

30:20.153 --> 30:22.447
dead body was found in
the back boiler room.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.033
And if that's not sick enough,

30:26.076 --> 30:28.995
we're gonna try out
the drone down there.

30:29.037 --> 30:30.872
Whoa.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.875
Weird deja vu moment again.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.293
You guys didn't get that?

30:36.336 --> 30:37.127
No.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.880
Oh get this, get this.

30:38.922 --> 30:39.963
No trespassing.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.054
Crap, oh seriously?

30:47.096 --> 30:48.889
Oh, dude we need bolt cutters.

30:48.932 --> 30:50.141
Dude, you can't
get through that.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.893
I can figure it out.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.602
Here, take this and set up
the camera over there, okay?

30:53.644 --> 30:55.855
You don't have super powers
by any chance, do you?

30:55.896 --> 30:57.564
I got pussy power.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.653
You're not as funny
as you think you are.

31:02.695 --> 31:03.487
Whoa.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.905
Oh, hey there we go.

31:04.948 --> 31:05.990
I think that I can
fit it through.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.117
You boys struggling
to make something fit?

31:08.159 --> 31:08.951
Ha.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.412
I love you, Danni.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.663
Okay.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.288
You got the picture up.

31:13.330 --> 31:14.164
Yeah.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.002
It's gonna be so cool.

31:20.672 --> 31:22.257
Okay, here we go.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.509
Ooh, that is creepy.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.551
Look at that.

31:25.593 --> 31:28.138
I think I found a new
dream home for me and Jess.

31:28.179 --> 31:30.890
This
hallway on the left?

31:30.932 --> 31:33.351
Wait, go the other way first.

31:35.353 --> 31:36.312
Do you see those?

31:36.354 --> 31:38.565
Oh, that's random.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.650
Huh, it's a cheap
date for Christopher.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.070
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

31:44.112 --> 31:44.903
Check that out.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.363
Is that a person?

31:50.117 --> 31:52.369
Nah, it's just
another creepy mannequin.

31:52.412 --> 31:55.539
Okay, go back to the hallway.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.000
You're really good at this.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.167
Your fingers are quite magic.

31:58.209 --> 31:59.044
I know.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.337
Those stairs?

32:01.378 --> 32:02.379
Mm-hmm.

32:02.422 --> 32:03.423
Can you go down them?

32:03.464 --> 32:04.298
Descend.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.134
Descend into the dark...

32:09.261 --> 32:10.221
Whoa.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.680
Where is it?
What happened to the feed?

32:11.722 --> 32:12.765
What happened?

32:12.807 --> 32:13.599
Dude, what did you do?

32:13.641 --> 32:14.642
Mike, will you stop?

32:14.683 --> 32:16.101
We have to find this
thing, I have to return it.

32:16.144 --> 32:16.935
Can I help you?

32:16.978 --> 32:18.480
Oh, busted.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.107
I know what you guys
are doing down here.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.194
Listen, I'm a huge
fan of your vlog.

32:25.236 --> 32:26.988
You're DropTheMike
and shit, right?

32:27.029 --> 32:28.030
Yeah, dude.

32:28.073 --> 32:29.157
Nice to meet you.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.240
Wow, thank you for watching.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.700
Yeah, of course.

32:31.742 --> 32:32.576
I love it but, you know,

32:32.618 --> 32:35.579
I still can't let you
in there with all,

32:35.622 --> 32:36.748
you know, all the
electrical boxes and shit.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.249
What's your name, man?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.125
- Tony.
- Tony, nice to meet you.

32:39.166 --> 32:39.958
Mike.

32:40.999 --> 32:41.336
Do you wanna...

32:41.377 --> 32:42.169
why don't you come down here
and say hi to my followers?

32:42.211 --> 32:43.212
What's up, guys?

32:43.253 --> 32:45.089
Tony, you like movies?

32:45.131 --> 32:46.341
Yeah, who doesn't?

32:46.383 --> 32:48.509
Could you ever see
yourself working security

32:48.550 --> 32:50.220
on a big studio lot?

32:50.260 --> 32:51.596
Holy shit, that'd be awesome.

32:51.637 --> 32:52.721
Yeah?

32:52.763 --> 32:55.099
Management, she has a
meeting like, tomorrow night.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.477
I might be able to
snag you a key then.

32:57.519 --> 32:59.144
You can just, I
don't know, like

32:59.186 --> 33:01.230
stick the key in an envelope
and put it through my door.

33:01.271 --> 33:02.106
Yeah, absolutely.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.357
Amazing.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.110
Hey, do you have any
like insider knowledge

33:05.151 --> 33:08.113
about the Meghan Kim thing?

33:08.153 --> 33:10.490
You guys know about The
Elevator Ritual, right?

33:10.531 --> 33:13.158
No, I do not know about
The Elevator Ritual.

33:13.201 --> 33:16.037
Look up The Elevator
Ritual online,

33:16.078 --> 33:19.124
then rewatch the Meghan
Kim elevator footage.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.084
It'll get you
closer to the truth.

33:21.125 --> 33:24.295
Okay, so apparently, there
is a popular Korean game

33:24.336 --> 33:25.504
called The Elevator Ritual.

33:25.547 --> 33:26.631
What is that?

33:26.673 --> 33:28.549
So first, you have to have
a hotel that is at least

33:28.590 --> 33:30.300
10 floors, which lucky for us,

33:30.343 --> 33:31.594
Lenox has more than 10 floors.

33:31.635 --> 33:32.721
Mmm, of course.

33:32.761 --> 33:36.765
Then you enter the elevator
on the first floor alone.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.144
You then go to the following
floors in this precise order.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.104
You go to the fourth,
second, sixth,

33:41.145 --> 33:42.813
second, 10th, and then fifth.

33:42.855 --> 33:43.690
This is fascinating.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.692
Okay, it gets more
interesting, okay?

33:45.733 --> 33:48.653
When you reach the
fifth floor, a woman

33:48.694 --> 33:49.528
is supposed to enter.

33:49.570 --> 33:50.779
Ooh, a woman.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.031
And then you have
mad, crazy sex.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.324
No,

33:53.365 --> 33:55.160
you're not supposed to look
at her or speak to her.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.370
Then you press the
first floor button.

33:57.412 --> 33:59.456
If the elevator
descends to the lobby,

33:59.497 --> 34:01.207
you exit quickly
without looking back.

34:01.249 --> 34:03.293
But, if instead of
going to the lobby,

34:03.335 --> 34:05.127
the elevator goes
to the 10th floor,

34:05.170 --> 34:07.130
you exit and the
woman's going to ask,

34:07.172 --> 34:08.547
"Where are you going?"

34:08.590 --> 34:10.800
You are not supposed to answer
her or even look at her.

34:10.842 --> 34:12.594
What happens next?

34:12.635 --> 34:14.137
Apparently, you enter

34:14.179 --> 34:15.304
the other world.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.056
And what is that
supposed to be?

34:18.099 --> 34:19.059
I don't know but

34:19.099 --> 34:22.228
check out Meghan Kim's video.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.438
See that?

34:23.480 --> 34:25.148
Wait, what
is she pressing?

34:25.190 --> 34:27.858
Okay, so the buttons
she pressed were one,

34:27.900 --> 34:31.277
five, 10, two, six, two, four.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.529
That's not the order
you said, though.

34:32.572 --> 34:33.489
No.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.699
It is the order, just reversed.

34:35.742 --> 34:39.371
My guess is that Meghan Kim
played The Elevator Ritual

34:39.411 --> 34:41.871
the night before and the
night that she disappeared,

34:41.914 --> 34:44.583
she was trying to undo it by
pressing the buttons backwards.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.127
I'm gonna do it so you don't
need to get your panties

34:46.168 --> 34:47.628
in a bunch, you don't
have to go with me

34:47.670 --> 34:50.089
'cause it does say that you
have to do it alone, so.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.216
I hope I come back, guys.

34:53.467 --> 34:54.426
This is wrong, Mike.

34:54.469 --> 34:55.594
Dude, relax.

34:55.637 --> 34:56.804
Yeah, I'm with her.

34:56.846 --> 34:57.639
All right, let's get ready.

34:57.681 --> 34:58.722
Let's do it.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.558
Okay, mighty minions,
it's just after midnight.

35:01.601 --> 35:03.394
I'm all rigged up for
The Elevator Ritual.

35:03.436 --> 35:05.771
I got my fancy little
button cam, a handheld

35:05.813 --> 35:07.856
so we got multiple
angles for you guys,

35:07.898 --> 35:10.109
and in the words of
cinematic thespian,

35:10.150 --> 35:12.903
Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger,

35:12.945 --> 35:14.447
I'll be back.

35:14.489 --> 35:16.657
Don't wait up, kids.

35:16.699 --> 35:18.451
Be careful.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.288
Okay, minions.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.331
We're about to embark
on The Elevator Ritual,

35:24.373 --> 35:25.541
starting on the first floor.

35:25.583 --> 35:28.128
Tony the security guard
totally hooked me up

35:28.168 --> 35:30.129
and shut off the security
camera in the elevator

35:30.170 --> 35:31.714
for 10 whole minutes.

35:31.755 --> 35:34.174
Tell Jess I love her.

35:34.217 --> 35:36.177
Okay, so as the rules mandate,

35:36.219 --> 35:39.389
we're going to the
fourth floor first.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.893
Fourth floor.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.144
Going down.

35:45.186 --> 35:46.896
That wasn't so bad.

35:46.938 --> 35:49.148
Now we head down to two.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.193
I feel like the
world's slowest yo-yo.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.278
Second floor.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.155
Going up.

35:55.947 --> 35:57.657
Number six is next.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.661
Sixth floor.

36:01.702 --> 36:02.661
Going down.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.461
Man, this game is crazy.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.221
Second floor.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.307
Huh, this seems familiar.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.934
Going up.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.186
Whoa.

36:39.949 --> 36:42.994
10th floor.

36:43.036 --> 36:45.663
Okay, so some faulty wiring.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.500
But so far, all is good.

36:48.541 --> 36:50.418
All right, final floor.

36:51.503 --> 36:53.838
Going down.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.715
My heart's pounding
for some reason.

37:16.068 --> 37:18.779
Fifth floor.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.038
All right.

37:27.079 --> 37:27.913
Debunked.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.458
Let's head back down to one.

37:31.501 --> 37:32.335
What?

37:40.592 --> 37:41.927
Let's head on home.

37:45.931 --> 37:46.849
Oh.

37:46.891 --> 37:47.684
You lost, son?

37:47.726 --> 37:48.559
No, no, I'm fine.

37:48.601 --> 37:49.394
Thank you so much.

37:49.436 --> 37:50.269
Okay.

37:58.402 --> 37:59.528
Okay, guys.

37:59.570 --> 38:00.739
Looks like the
Korean elevator game

38:00.780 --> 38:02.574
is indeed a big hoax.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.409
I knew it from the get-go.

38:16.963 --> 38:19.591
Where are you going?

38:48.161 --> 38:50.413
Right there, right there.

38:52.164 --> 38:52.998
What?

38:53.041 --> 38:54.417
Is that the fifth floor?

38:54.458 --> 38:55.376
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:55.418 --> 38:57.378
Okay, right there.

38:57.420 --> 38:58.463
What?

38:59.713 --> 39:01.465
What, that's Meghan Kim, dude.

39:01.507 --> 39:02.966
You didn't say anything
to her, did you?

39:03.009 --> 39:04.427
No, no, no, of course I
didn't say anything to her.

39:04.469 --> 39:05.720
- What?
- I was terrified.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.472
My heart has never
beat that fast before.

39:07.514 --> 39:08.640
It was crazy, I've
never been that scared.

39:08.681 --> 39:09.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:09.516 --> 39:10.474
You hired a look-alike.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.684
No, no, I swear.

39:11.726 --> 39:13.103
I swear I did not hire
a look-alike, okay?

39:13.143 --> 39:13.936
Dude, are you

39:13.978 --> 39:15.063
- messing around?
- Was this you guys?

39:15.105 --> 39:15.896
No, it wasn't us!

39:15.938 --> 39:16.815
It wasn't you guys?

39:16.856 --> 39:17.941
'Cause if it was, please fess up

39:17.981 --> 39:19.692
'cause I will worship the
ground that you walk on.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.485
Seriously, okay?

39:21.527 --> 39:22.528
Dude, this isn't a joke!

39:22.570 --> 39:23.530
Are you kidding me?

39:23.570 --> 39:25.364
Look at the video, that's her.

39:25.407 --> 39:27.075
You know what this means?

39:27.117 --> 39:28.410
It means we're gone.
That's her.

39:28.451 --> 39:29.661
No, no, no.

39:29.702 --> 39:30.704
Dude, this was one
of my fucking fans!

39:30.744 --> 39:31.913
- No, Mike.
- No.

39:31.954 --> 39:33.831
One of my followers
dressed up as Meghan Kim

39:33.873 --> 39:35.458
and came to the hotel
just to scare me.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.001
- Oh, that's amazing.
- No, you're wrong!

39:37.043 --> 39:37.961
I love you guys.

39:38.003 --> 39:38.878
Ugh!

39:38.920 --> 39:39.838
Dude, look at the picture.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.130
That is her.

39:41.172 --> 39:42.757
You're messing with
your life, Michael.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.634
She doesn't look
like Meghan Kim, okay?

39:44.675 --> 39:46.719
Look, we will go compare
it to the footage

39:46.760 --> 39:48.179
from the actual elevator video.

39:48.221 --> 39:49.179
She looks nothing
like Meghan Kim, okay?

39:49.222 --> 39:50.807
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

39:50.849 --> 39:51.682
God, I'm sweating so much.

39:51.724 --> 39:52.641
Okay, come on.

39:52.684 --> 39:55.437
Come on, come on, come on.

39:55.478 --> 39:56.688
Dude,
that's the same girl.

39:56.730 --> 39:59.733
That is not the
same person at all.

39:59.773 --> 40:02.152
I could
go either way, guys.

40:02.193 --> 40:03.194
Come on, Danni.

40:05.530 --> 40:06.948
Who's that?

40:06.989 --> 40:08.490
Did you hear that?

40:09.576 --> 40:11.036
What's going on?

40:11.077 --> 40:12.037
Who's out there?

40:12.077 --> 40:13.954
There's nobody out here.

40:13.996 --> 40:15.205
Come here.

40:15.248 --> 40:16.041
Mike,
they just knocked.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.375
They couldn't have
hid that quick.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.208
I don't see
anybody, dude, okay?

40:18.251 --> 40:19.711
It's not like a...

40:21.128 --> 40:22.422
Is anybody out here?

40:22.463 --> 40:23.547
No,
there's nobody here.

40:23.590 --> 40:24.423
Weird.

40:26.092 --> 40:27.177
I don't know.

40:33.349 --> 40:34.141
Who was it?

40:34.184 --> 40:36.603
They ran away again.

40:36.643 --> 40:37.436
I don't know.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.480
Nothing?

40:41.023 --> 40:41.940
What is this?

40:41.983 --> 40:42.901
Another earthquake, Mike?

40:42.942 --> 40:44.152
Dude.

40:44.193 --> 40:45.695
They couldn't
have hid that fast.

40:45.737 --> 40:46.905
It's probably
just Nic messing with us.

40:46.945 --> 40:47.739
I can't believe
I'm locking in myself

40:47.780 --> 40:49.074
in David Olmos's room.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.908
They're really good
at this, it's amazing.

40:52.409 --> 40:53.202
Guys, guys, guys, chill.

40:53.244 --> 40:54.454
It's just,

40:54.496 --> 40:56.498
it's my text messages, okay?

40:56.539 --> 40:58.792
It's Jess, she wants
to Skype with me.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.585
Just, you guys
have a few minutes.

41:00.626 --> 41:01.753
Just relax, I'm
sorry it scared you.

41:01.795 --> 41:03.213
Just chill, okay?

41:14.556 --> 41:16.100
Hey, babe.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.726
How's everything going, hun?

41:17.768 --> 41:19.478
It's good.

41:19.521 --> 41:21.523
Going awesome, how are you?

41:21.563 --> 41:23.107
Yeah, it's really
busy right now.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.650
They asked me to work a double,

41:24.693 --> 41:28.655
lots of injuries, bunch
of drunks and such,

41:28.697 --> 41:31.950
just typical
Halloween Eve stuff.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.242
I can imagine.

41:33.284 --> 41:37.414
Just careful around
those drunk idiots, okay?

41:37.454 --> 41:38.248
I'll let you get back to work.

41:38.289 --> 41:39.791
Wait.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.126
What's up?

41:41.166 --> 41:44.211
I wanted to wait
until you got home

41:44.253 --> 41:46.547
for me to tell you this but

41:46.588 --> 41:48.132
the administration
asked the entire staff

41:48.173 --> 41:49.342
to take a blood test last week,

41:49.384 --> 41:53.762
just usual drug testing stuff,
but they said that they found

41:53.804 --> 41:56.181
something unusual in my blood.

41:57.349 --> 41:58.684
Unusual?

41:58.726 --> 42:02.021
Yeah, it's called
chorionic gonadotropin.

42:02.063 --> 42:03.565
Jesus, what is that?

42:03.606 --> 42:05.525
More accurately,
it's referred to

42:05.567 --> 42:08.068
as human chorionic gonadotropin.

42:08.110 --> 42:08.902
Well what is it?

42:08.945 --> 42:09.738
Is it a disease?

42:09.778 --> 42:10.780
I mean...

42:10.822 --> 42:12.532
I'm pregnant, Michael.

42:12.574 --> 42:14.075
You're pregnant?

42:15.159 --> 42:16.702
Did Chris put you up to this?

42:16.744 --> 42:17.828
No.

42:17.871 --> 42:19.039
I'm completely serious.

42:19.079 --> 42:20.581
I mean, they already
confirmed it.

42:20.623 --> 42:23.876
Babe, we're gonna have a baby.

42:23.918 --> 42:25.628
We're gonna have a baby.

42:25.670 --> 42:26.796
Oh, man.

42:26.838 --> 42:28.131
How does that make you feel?

42:28.172 --> 42:29.715
Uh, my mind is

42:31.592 --> 42:33.594
completely blown, but...

42:35.221 --> 42:37.014
This is fantastic news.

42:37.056 --> 42:37.890
I mean,

42:39.224 --> 42:41.853
I mean, God, it's
unexpected as shit, but...

42:41.894 --> 42:43.188
Are we getting this right now?

42:43.228 --> 42:44.688
Yeah.

42:44.731 --> 42:47.901
Listen, I gotta
go back to work, but

42:47.942 --> 42:50.737
we'll celebrate
when you get home?

42:50.778 --> 42:52.989
Yeah, no, we'll celebrate when

42:53.030 --> 42:54.990
we get home, absolutely.

42:55.909 --> 42:56.785
Love you.

42:58.661 --> 43:00.163
I love you more.

43:01.164 --> 43:02.082
Okay.

43:02.123 --> 43:03.041
Okay.

43:03.083 --> 43:03.916
Yeah.

43:08.295 --> 43:09.838
Say what?

43:09.880 --> 43:11.590
Oh my God!

43:11.632 --> 43:12.675
That's massive!

43:14.302 --> 43:15.135
Oh my God.

43:20.307 --> 43:21.141
Okay.

43:22.811 --> 43:24.813
You heard it here first.

43:29.192 --> 43:31.110
Wat are you guys
talking about?

43:31.152 --> 43:34.030
- Don't worry about it.
- Nothing.

43:34.072 --> 43:35.323
Oh, that's so...

43:37.242 --> 43:39.661
Danni, are you getting that?

43:39.702 --> 43:40.619
The noise?

43:40.661 --> 43:41.954
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

43:41.996 --> 43:43.748
What is that?

43:43.789 --> 43:45.083
I don't know, dude.

43:45.125 --> 43:46.668
Just chill out, please.

43:46.710 --> 43:49.003
The hotel's like 90
years old, come on.

43:49.045 --> 43:50.672
Trust me, my 90
year-old grandmother

43:50.713 --> 43:53.340
made a lot worse
noises than that.

43:54.634 --> 43:55.427
What is going on?

43:55.467 --> 43:56.594
Danni, did you pick that up?

43:56.635 --> 43:57.429
Yeah.

43:57.469 --> 43:59.054
It sounds like it's Nic's room.

43:59.097 --> 44:01.932
Dude, can you go check on her?

44:01.974 --> 44:02.891
Dude, just...

44:02.934 --> 44:04.102
Please just go over there.

44:04.143 --> 44:05.102
Yeah, camera?

44:05.144 --> 44:06.730
Always.

44:11.693 --> 44:13.028
Hey, Nic?

44:13.068 --> 44:16.322
Hey, do you have that
overnight footage ready yet?

44:16.364 --> 44:18.867
I wanna see how it turned out.

44:31.295 --> 44:32.129
Nic?

44:35.717 --> 44:37.135
Christopher!

44:37.177 --> 44:40.387
I have six new video
cards to download and cut.

44:40.429 --> 44:42.014
I don't have time
for you to be playing

44:42.056 --> 44:43.807
your stupid junior
high school games.

44:43.849 --> 44:45.184
Now will you please

44:45.226 --> 44:46.227
just shut up

44:47.519 --> 44:49.313
and close the door?

44:49.356 --> 44:50.273
Jesus, Nic.

44:50.315 --> 44:51.148
Your nose.

44:53.735 --> 44:54.986
Shit, I'm fine.

44:55.027 --> 44:56.195
I am fine.

44:56.237 --> 44:57.780
Now just give me
some freaking space!

44:57.822 --> 45:00.200
Okay, jeez, jeez.

45:06.206 --> 45:07.374
Ugh, now what?

45:10.793 --> 45:12.336
Hello?

45:18.259 --> 45:19.719
You okay, dude?

45:23.264 --> 45:24.432
Too much wine?

45:29.019 --> 45:30.188
Mike!

45:30.230 --> 45:32.315
Mike, Mike, Mike!

45:32.356 --> 45:33.315
Mike, Mike!

45:33.358 --> 45:34.442
Jesus, dude, what is it?

45:34.483 --> 45:37.444
This guy at the
end of the hallway, his head!

45:37.487 --> 45:38.363
What about his head?

45:38.405 --> 45:40.740
It bent
backwards all unnatural.

45:40.782 --> 45:41.740
What?

45:41.782 --> 45:42.616
Yeah, yeah.

45:42.659 --> 45:43.451
Just completely un-human.

45:43.492 --> 45:44.284
Wait, where?

45:44.327 --> 45:45.120
There's nobody here, dude.

45:45.161 --> 45:46.788
Where did he go?

45:46.829 --> 45:47.706
He was right there.

45:47.746 --> 45:50.500
You think he went
out the fire escape?

45:50.541 --> 45:51.750
It's open.

45:52.835 --> 45:54.086
Are you sure you saw someone?

45:54.128 --> 45:55.797
Yes, I'm
sure I saw someone.

45:55.838 --> 45:57.047
There's nobody up here, okay?

45:57.090 --> 45:58.173
Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

45:58.215 --> 45:59.384
What's that?

45:59.425 --> 46:00.844
Oh, what?

46:00.885 --> 46:02.554
What is that?

46:02.594 --> 46:03.679
It's right on top of...

46:03.722 --> 46:04.514
Oh!

46:04.556 --> 46:06.307
A satanic symbol.

46:06.349 --> 46:08.393
Oh, it's just like the
one that David Olmos

46:08.434 --> 46:09.601
has on his hand.

46:09.643 --> 46:10.894
Wait, isn't this
right where our room is, guys?

46:10.936 --> 46:12.021
Oh, man.

46:13.398 --> 46:14.774
But there's
not even room service

46:14.815 --> 46:15.817
in this hotel, is there?

46:15.858 --> 46:16.692
No, not for decades.

46:16.735 --> 46:17.527
Mike, don't touch it.

46:17.568 --> 46:18.527
Don't touch it.

46:18.570 --> 46:19.571
It's warm.

46:19.612 --> 46:20.447
Mike.

46:21.905 --> 46:22.907
Oh!

46:23.867 --> 46:25.744
Oh, that is so gross.

46:25.784 --> 46:26.577
Oh, that's disgusting.

46:26.619 --> 46:27.579
Oh my God, it smells.

46:27.619 --> 46:28.579
I can't.

46:28.621 --> 46:29.414
There's something...

46:29.456 --> 46:30.248
What is that?

46:30.289 --> 46:31.416
I think it's a tongue?

46:31.458 --> 46:32.834
It's a tongue.

46:34.293 --> 46:35.085
Don't.

46:35.128 --> 46:35.961
Please don't touch it.

46:36.003 --> 46:36.920
I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna do it.

46:36.963 --> 46:37.756
I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna do it.

46:37.797 --> 46:38.590
I can't.

46:43.469 --> 46:45.596
Guys, chill, it's not human.

46:45.637 --> 46:46.972
How do you know that?

46:47.014 --> 46:48.849
Because it's
way too big, okay?

46:48.891 --> 46:50.309
They would have had
to gut Gene Simmons.

46:50.351 --> 46:53.145
Mike, I actually don't
feel comfortable with this.

46:53.188 --> 46:55.273
We should talk
to hotel management.

46:55.315 --> 46:56.398
Call the cops, man.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.150
No, they'll kick us out
and we'll lose the shoot.

46:58.193 --> 46:59.444
Look, this isn't about

46:59.485 --> 47:01.945
ghastly spirits, they
don't exist, okay?

47:01.987 --> 47:05.282
I'm sorry that like, you're
concerned right now but...

47:05.324 --> 47:08.285
Look, don't tell me that
I'm overreacting, okay?

47:08.327 --> 47:09.496
- Dude, Christopher.
- Chris, Chris.

47:09.536 --> 47:10.954
And don't
tell me that I'm losing

47:10.996 --> 47:11.955
some type of control.

47:11.998 --> 47:13.375
Stop, stop.

47:13.416 --> 47:14.459
Watch your step, watch
your step, watch your step.

47:14.501 --> 47:16.086
All right, you've got to
admit it's pretty awesome

47:16.126 --> 47:17.711
that the vlog is
getting interactive.

47:17.753 --> 47:18.545
Interactive?

47:18.588 --> 47:19.381
Yeah.

47:19.422 --> 47:20.632
No, this is demonic.

47:20.673 --> 47:23.300
Dude, if dastardly
demons were real,

47:23.342 --> 47:24.927
then nobody would be
staying in this hotel.

47:24.969 --> 47:26.471
That's what you
don't get, Mike.

47:26.512 --> 47:27.931
It's not about them being real,

47:27.972 --> 47:29.599
it's about you provoking them.

47:29.641 --> 47:30.642
Okay, you need to relax.

47:30.684 --> 47:32.185
Here.

47:32.226 --> 47:33.478
Mama's little helper.

47:33.519 --> 47:35.438
It's way better than
that anxiety bullcrap

47:35.480 --> 47:36.648
you've been taking.

47:36.690 --> 47:37.648
You'll get better dreams, too.

47:37.690 --> 47:39.192
I would advise against that.

47:39.233 --> 47:40.985
Hey, not helpful.

47:41.027 --> 47:42.153
There you go.

47:42.195 --> 47:43.153
Thatta boy.

47:43.195 --> 47:46.074
Seriously, dude,
it's gonna help.

47:46.115 --> 47:47.449
All right, guys.

47:48.534 --> 47:51.453
I mean, that's
hardcore but let's...

47:51.496 --> 47:53.664
Let's head downstairs
and we'll set a trap

47:53.706 --> 47:55.165
for whoever's been
knocking on the door

47:55.208 --> 47:56.418
in the morning, okay?

47:56.458 --> 47:58.210
It's probably the same
DropTheMike follower

47:58.253 --> 48:00.505
as whoever did
this, so, all right?

48:00.547 --> 48:03.382
Yes, can we go?

48:03.425 --> 48:04.259
Agreed.

48:14.686 --> 48:17.271
Hey, Christopher said
your nose was bleeding.

48:17.313 --> 48:18.398
Are you okay?

48:22.027 --> 48:23.110
Are you okay?

48:33.579 --> 48:34.413
Nic.

48:55.018 --> 48:57.061
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:57.103 --> 48:58.563
Talk to me, what's wrong?

48:58.605 --> 48:59.646
What's wrong?

48:59.688 --> 49:00.565
Fuck.

49:00.606 --> 49:03.233
Oh God, you're recording
this, aren't you?

49:03.275 --> 49:04.234
No, no, no, no.

49:04.277 --> 49:05.320
It's just a force of habit.

49:05.362 --> 49:06.488
You'll edit it out later, okay?

49:06.528 --> 49:07.947
Okay, please edit it out.

49:07.989 --> 49:09.157
My God.

49:09.199 --> 49:10.575
Hey, hey, come on.

49:10.617 --> 49:12.035
No, no, no, I just...

49:12.077 --> 49:13.286
Just seems like a

49:14.161 --> 49:15.663
lot of

49:15.704 --> 49:18.958
energies are boiling up
inside of me this weekend.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.585
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:20.626 --> 49:22.753
Hey listen, just
do me a favor.

49:22.795 --> 49:25.172
I want you to get
some sleep tonight

49:25.215 --> 49:26.591
and stop editing
for a little bit.

49:26.632 --> 49:27.966
You can worry about
it in the morning.

49:28.009 --> 49:30.010
No, there's gonna
be too much to finish.

49:30.052 --> 49:32.262
No, no, no, there isn't, okay?

49:32.304 --> 49:34.098
Look, look, everybody knows
we're on a time crunch.

49:34.139 --> 49:35.974
You don't need to make
things as flawless

49:36.016 --> 49:37.018
as you normally do.

49:37.059 --> 49:38.686
I'm sorry, I'm so embarrassed.

49:38.728 --> 49:40.105
No, no, no, no.

49:40.146 --> 49:42.981
Don't be sorry, don't be sorry.

49:44.150 --> 49:46.735
All right, you're gonna
get some sleep, right?

49:46.777 --> 49:47.736
Okay.

49:47.778 --> 49:48.612
All right.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.427
I need way more
subscribers, guys.

50:10.467 --> 50:11.301
Come on.

50:12.429 --> 50:15.139
You've gotta help me out here.

50:18.184 --> 50:19.019
Okay.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.649
Danni, you awake?

50:25.692 --> 50:27.235
Are you sleeping?

50:27.277 --> 50:29.112
Far from it.

50:30.655 --> 50:34.451
You watch Chris's
footage of the headless guy?

50:34.492 --> 50:35.618
Yeah.

50:35.659 --> 50:38.328
That was freaky as hell.

50:42.166 --> 50:43.625
You want?

50:47.130 --> 50:49.048
Everybody's
doing it, right?

50:49.090 --> 50:49.923
Right on.

52:01.161 --> 52:02.621
Hey, guys, so

52:02.664 --> 52:05.875
we're waiting for my
super fan or whoever it is

52:05.916 --> 52:08.210
that's been trolling us
and knocking on the door so

52:08.253 --> 52:10.838
we're just doing a little
stakeout right now.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.258
It's been super interesting
so far so I thought I'd

52:13.298 --> 52:14.259
clue you guys in.

52:14.300 --> 52:15.135
Anyways.

52:20.931 --> 52:22.641
Is that a good idea?

52:22.684 --> 52:26.146
They're just walking
away, it's fine.

52:27.271 --> 52:28.273
Hey, Chris.

52:28.313 --> 52:29.440
Want floor on your food.

52:29.481 --> 52:30.442
No!

52:30.483 --> 52:31.526
What is that?

52:32.985 --> 52:33.777
Stop, man.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.196
You guys are like,
awkwardly close.

52:35.237 --> 52:36.196
You know that, right?

52:36.239 --> 52:37.240
Eh.

52:37.282 --> 52:38.658
Wait.

52:38.699 --> 52:42.244
I don't think I actually
know how you guys met.

52:42.286 --> 52:44.204
Let's see, elementary school.

52:44.246 --> 52:45.205
No.

52:45.248 --> 52:46.331
No, it was...

52:49.001 --> 52:52.212
We met at the
psychiatrist's office.

52:53.547 --> 52:54.506
Yep, we were in the...

52:54.548 --> 52:55.717
No, you're messing with me.

52:55.759 --> 52:56.717
No, yeah.

52:56.760 --> 52:57.969
We were in the waiting room.

52:58.010 --> 53:01.264
I knew you guys were
totally screwed up.

53:01.306 --> 53:02.432
All right, boys.

53:03.266 --> 53:05.226
What were you in for?

53:05.934 --> 53:07.228
I don't know.

53:07.269 --> 53:08.646
Parent shit.

53:08.688 --> 53:10.481
I'll be right back.

53:10.523 --> 53:11.983
Where you going?

53:12.025 --> 53:16.863
I'm gonna give my pee ration
at the urination station.

53:18.864 --> 53:20.657
You know, for a guy who
really likes the sound

53:20.699 --> 53:22.284
of his own voice,
that was pretty weird.

53:22.327 --> 53:24.454
Well, get down to the
good stuff and he bolts.

53:29.041 --> 53:30.668
This would be like, a
really good time to tell me

53:30.710 --> 53:34.255
why you stopped calling
me over the summer.

53:34.297 --> 53:35.423
Are you not gonna tell me?

53:35.465 --> 53:36.257
No.

53:36.298 --> 53:37.300
No?

53:38.717 --> 53:39.677
Tell me.

53:39.719 --> 53:40.804
Okay, okay.

53:43.222 --> 53:46.393
The pain started to
outweigh the pleasure.

53:46.434 --> 53:48.353
Mike, is that you?

53:48.394 --> 53:49.813
What is
that supposed to mean?

53:49.853 --> 53:50.771
Mike, I can't see you, buddy.

53:50.813 --> 53:51.730
You gotta...

53:51.773 --> 53:54.317
I can't see you, it's too dark.

53:54.358 --> 53:55.485
I loved you.

53:55.527 --> 54:00.240
Mike, man, I am so sorry
about everything that happened.

54:00.280 --> 54:03.784
Yo, have you been in
contact with Chris or Danni?

54:03.827 --> 54:04.828
And I knew

54:08.748 --> 54:11.001
that you didn't
feel the same way.

54:11.041 --> 54:13.752
I don't know, I sound like
a Hallmark card right now.

54:13.795 --> 54:15.338
Like a little.

54:16.047 --> 54:17.257
Chris,

54:20.385 --> 54:22.303
you know that you've
always been like,

54:22.344 --> 54:24.263
a brother to me, right?

54:25.597 --> 54:26.432
Mm-hmm.

54:28.434 --> 54:30.353
I mean, when you
stopped calling me, it was

54:30.394 --> 54:32.355
kind of a void for me too.

54:33.815 --> 54:37.735
I don't know, it's a
two-way street, I guess.

54:37.777 --> 54:38.820
Woo!

54:40.070 --> 54:42.656
I just expelled a
foul demon out my ass.

54:42.699 --> 54:44.075
TMI, dude.

54:44.117 --> 54:45.827
So what were
you guys talking about?

54:45.869 --> 54:47.077
Nothing, Mike.

54:47.119 --> 54:49.038
Okay, whatever dude.

54:49.079 --> 54:52.041
Hey, so I was thinking we
can finish up lunch soon.

54:52.083 --> 54:54.043
I don't think anybody's
gonna show up right now

54:54.085 --> 54:55.295
so we might as well.

54:55.336 --> 54:56.170
What the...

54:58.630 --> 55:01.884
I think I know that
kid from somewhere.

55:03.762 --> 55:05.347
You know him?

55:05.387 --> 55:06.472
Hey, kid!

55:06.514 --> 55:07.474
I'll be right back.

55:07.514 --> 55:08.599
Kid, wait up.

55:08.641 --> 55:09.476
Mike,
where are you going?

55:09.516 --> 55:10.351
What do you mean you know him?

55:10.393 --> 55:11.436
Mike?

55:12.519 --> 55:13.355
Mike!

55:16.483 --> 55:18.318
I'm gonna go find him.

55:19.485 --> 55:20.319
Mike?

55:21.487 --> 55:22.321
Mike!

55:24.157 --> 55:26.326
Where'd he go?

55:26.367 --> 55:27.284
Do you see him?

55:27.327 --> 55:28.119
He's gone.

55:32.498 --> 55:34.375
Hey kid, wait.

55:34.416 --> 55:36.670
He's not here.

55:36.710 --> 55:38.545
Dude, I don't know.

55:38.588 --> 55:40.006
We should check on Nic.

55:40.047 --> 55:41.465
No, no, no, no.

55:41.507 --> 55:43.759
Leave her alone, she
was upset earlier.

55:43.802 --> 55:44.803
Is that...

55:46.387 --> 55:47.429
Does that...

55:47.472 --> 55:49.474
What?

55:49.516 --> 55:50.392
Chris?

55:50.432 --> 55:51.434
Danni?

55:51.476 --> 55:52.811
Chris?

55:52.851 --> 55:54.895
Chris, turn on
your camera light.

55:54.938 --> 55:56.106
Chris!

55:57.856 --> 55:59.567
Danni, run!

56:00.610 --> 56:01.820
Danni, open the door!

56:01.860 --> 56:03.070
Do you have the key?

56:03.112 --> 56:04.697
No, I
don't have a key.

56:04.739 --> 56:05.782
Fuck, fuck.

56:05.824 --> 56:07.409
Danni, open the door.

56:07.449 --> 56:08.534
Okay, okay.

56:09.369 --> 56:11.371
- Wait, wait.
- Do you hear that?

56:11.413 --> 56:12.414
Wait.

56:17.835 --> 56:18.877
Hey, kid.

56:18.920 --> 56:19.753
Hey.

56:20.713 --> 56:22.965
Where do I know you from?

56:36.730 --> 56:37.896
Hey.

56:48.449 --> 56:50.076
Fold up the tripod.

56:50.117 --> 56:51.744
Fold up the tripod.

56:53.246 --> 56:54.456
Get behind me.

56:54.496 --> 56:55.456
Get behind me.

56:57.000 --> 56:57.916
Whoa, oh my God.

56:57.958 --> 56:59.210
- Oh my God.
- Mike?

56:59.251 --> 57:00.128
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

57:00.170 --> 57:01.046
What are you doing here?

57:01.086 --> 57:02.630
We thought you were
gone chasing that kid.

57:02.672 --> 57:03.757
How did you...

57:03.797 --> 57:04.757
Did you see Olmas?

57:04.798 --> 57:06.425
What are you talking about?

57:06.467 --> 57:07.301
There was a guy out
there who looked like him.

57:07.344 --> 57:09.929
I was just knocking
on room 440, okay?

57:09.971 --> 57:10.764
Stop messing with us, Mike!

57:10.804 --> 57:11.931
We saw him out there!

57:11.972 --> 57:12.931
Jesus, Chris!

57:12.974 --> 57:14.601
I am not messing with you, okay?

57:14.641 --> 57:16.018
I was knocking on room 440

57:16.061 --> 57:17.644
and you guys answered the door.

57:17.686 --> 57:20.522
I don't know what's
happening, okay?

57:20.565 --> 57:23.985
Check my footage if
you don't believe me.

57:25.570 --> 57:26.738
What happened?

57:33.619 --> 57:35.454
What is this?

57:35.496 --> 57:37.248
I don't know, dude,
leftover drone footage.

57:37.289 --> 57:38.123
No, it's not!

57:38.166 --> 57:39.250
I remember shooting
that drone footage...

57:39.291 --> 57:41.126
Chris, stop yelling at me!

57:41.168 --> 57:43.754
Okay, boys, sit down!

57:43.797 --> 57:46.590
Did you not just see that
guy outside with the hacksaw?

57:46.632 --> 57:48.926
What guy with
the hacksaw, okay?

57:48.967 --> 57:49.885
We got it on video, listen...

57:49.927 --> 57:50.929
I don't care, Danni.

57:50.969 --> 57:52.179
The hallway was empty.

57:52.222 --> 57:54.599
I was just knocking on a
door on the fourth floor

57:54.641 --> 57:56.059
and I don't know what happened.

57:56.101 --> 57:57.268
What were you
doing at room 440?

57:57.309 --> 57:59.144
I was chasing that kid, okay?

57:59.186 --> 58:00.270
God.

58:00.313 --> 58:02.523
Mike, what's in your hand?

58:02.565 --> 58:03.483
Oh my God, what?

58:03.525 --> 58:04.651
Oh my God.

58:12.992 --> 58:13.952
Oh my God.

58:13.992 --> 58:15.661
What is...
Oh my God.

58:16.579 --> 58:18.748
Oh, that's disgusting.

58:18.789 --> 58:20.625
Can we
please call the police?

58:20.666 --> 58:21.625
Dude.

58:21.668 --> 58:22.961
Dude, chill, okay?

58:23.003 --> 58:24.629
It's probably just...

58:24.670 --> 58:25.587
Give me a second.

58:25.630 --> 58:26.673
It's probably just from the...

58:26.715 --> 58:28.173
from the same animal

58:28.215 --> 58:29.925
that the tongue and the
entrails came from, okay?

58:29.967 --> 58:32.594
Mike, what kind of kid
carries an eyeball around?

58:32.637 --> 58:33.972
Go down and confront them.

58:34.014 --> 58:35.640
I'm not going to confront
a bunch of maniacs.

58:35.681 --> 58:37.683
If we have both
cameras pointed on them,

58:37.726 --> 58:38.893
they're not gonna do anything.

58:38.934 --> 58:41.145
Uh, yes, they could
take our cameras,

58:41.186 --> 58:43.230
kill us, and then
God knows what.

58:43.273 --> 58:44.106
Fine.

58:45.025 --> 58:46.276
I'll call Tony, okay?

58:46.317 --> 58:48.652
And he can help us.

58:48.695 --> 58:50.697
God, this is disgusting.

58:51.530 --> 58:52.322
This is where he led you?

58:52.364 --> 58:53.198
Yeah.

58:59.748 --> 59:00.581
Oh my.

59:01.750 --> 59:02.958
What do you want?

59:03.001 --> 59:04.544
Sorry to
disturb you, ma'am.

59:04.585 --> 59:07.004
Is there a young boy
staying with you?

59:07.047 --> 59:07.963
No.

59:08.005 --> 59:09.632
Are you making a movie?

59:09.673 --> 59:11.092
I love movies.

59:11.134 --> 59:12.635
No, we're making
a documentary.

59:12.677 --> 59:14.679
Has anything strange
happened in your room

59:14.721 --> 59:15.972
since you two
started staying here?

59:16.014 --> 59:17.682
No.

59:17.724 --> 59:19.351
Should there have?

59:19.391 --> 59:21.185
Sorry for
the inconvenience.

59:21.226 --> 59:23.062
No problem.

59:23.103 --> 59:25.314
Have a blessed day.

59:25.356 --> 59:26.648
Joyce!

59:26.690 --> 59:28.275
Shut the darn door!

59:30.362 --> 59:31.695
I don't know, man.

59:31.737 --> 59:33.030
I swear the boy led me here.

59:33.072 --> 59:34.324
I don't...

59:34.365 --> 59:35.617
Hey,
Tony, clean up the mess.

59:35.657 --> 59:36.534
Coming.

59:36.576 --> 59:37.369
Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

59:37.409 --> 59:38.286
Do you have the basement key?

59:38.327 --> 59:39.329
I'll get it to you tonight.

59:39.371 --> 59:40.579
Thank you.

59:41.914 --> 59:43.208
I don't know, guys.

59:43.248 --> 59:44.333
I don't know.

59:44.376 --> 59:45.835
Michael,

59:45.876 --> 59:47.670
is everything okay?

59:47.711 --> 59:49.172
Yeah, yeah,
Wallace, we're fine.

59:49.213 --> 59:52.049
Listen, has anything bad
ever happened in room 440

59:52.092 --> 59:53.218
in the Lenox?

59:54.427 --> 59:55.804
Absolutely.

59:55.844 --> 59:57.596
Kay, what was it?

59:58.931 --> 01:00:00.599
In the early
nineties, a detective

01:00:00.641 --> 01:00:02.768
was called in to
investigate a crime there.

01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:05.855
He had a spotless 10 year record

01:00:05.896 --> 01:00:07.940
and in the investigation,

01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:12.653
he was trying to find
out the reasoning behind

01:00:12.695 --> 01:00:15.406
a French couple that was
bludgeoned to death in that room.

01:00:15.447 --> 01:00:17.908
He decided to stay in the room,

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:20.744
hoping to lure back the killer,

01:00:22.329 --> 01:00:24.833
but he left after three weeks
and returned to his home

01:00:24.873 --> 01:00:27.251
in Culver City, where he
proceeded to put a knife

01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:28.795
through his wife's
heart three times

01:00:28.836 --> 01:00:31.088
while she was asleep and then

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:32.798
gouged her eyes out.

01:00:34.384 --> 01:00:35.969
After that,

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:37.262
he drove the kids...

01:00:37.302 --> 01:00:38.262
He had kids?

01:00:38.304 --> 01:00:39.264
Yeah.

01:00:39.304 --> 01:00:40.639
He had two boys.

01:00:40.681 --> 01:00:41.765
How old were they?

01:00:41.807 --> 01:00:43.643
Do you have a picture of them?

01:00:43.684 --> 01:00:46.645
I do but it's in my book.

01:00:46.688 --> 01:00:47.689
I'll go get it.

01:00:49.815 --> 01:00:52.735
I'm gonna use the bathroom
while he's looking for that.

01:00:52.777 --> 01:00:55.822
Yeah, I'll
keep an eye on him.

01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:59.701
Well.

01:01:05.248 --> 01:01:06.249
Holy shit.

01:01:07.708 --> 01:01:09.793
Do you know what
happened to them?

01:01:09.835 --> 01:01:12.796
What happened to the boys?

01:01:12.838 --> 01:01:14.423
Well,

01:01:14.465 --> 01:01:16.884
he took them to the room, 440

01:01:18.719 --> 01:01:19.846
and proceeded to

01:01:21.347 --> 01:01:23.849
put a knife through his
seven year-old's heart

01:01:23.891 --> 01:01:27.770
and gouge his eyes out,
just like his mother.

01:01:27.811 --> 01:01:30.731
What happened to
the younger one?

01:01:30.773 --> 01:01:32.817
He took off down the stairs,
down to the boiler room.

01:01:32.858 --> 01:01:35.362
The father, the
detective chased him.

01:01:35.402 --> 01:01:38.739
When he go to the boiler room,

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:42.035
a maintenance man had
been working down there.

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:44.704
And before the detective
could get his son,

01:01:44.746 --> 01:01:48.083
the maintenance man bashed
his head in and killed him

01:01:48.123 --> 01:01:49.875
with a pipe wrench.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.795
Didn't you know this story?

01:01:52.836 --> 01:01:53.838
It's a

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.423
Hotel Lenox classic.

01:01:57.884 --> 01:01:59.344
Thank you, Wallace.

01:01:59.385 --> 01:02:00.219
Mike,

01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:03.139
is everything all right?

01:02:03.181 --> 01:02:04.224
I gotta go.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.106
I need a minute.

01:02:12.148 --> 01:02:13.024
Mike, you okay?

01:02:13.065 --> 01:02:14.149
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:16.193 --> 01:02:19.197
Stuff like that
shouldn't happen to kids.

01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:20.782
Just give me a sec.

01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:32.085
Chris?

01:02:33.545 --> 01:02:34.378
Chris?

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.880
Whatever you do,
keep the lens up, okay?

01:02:36.922 --> 01:02:39.133
Chris, open up!
Chris!

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.052
Chris, Chris?

01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:42.052
- Christopher!
- Chris.

01:02:42.094 --> 01:02:43.053
Danni, the door's locked.

01:02:43.096 --> 01:02:44.389
Chris, open the door.

01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:45.432
Open the door, Chris.

01:02:45.472 --> 01:02:46.891
Christopher, can you open it?

01:02:46.932 --> 01:02:47.809
Open it, open it, open it.

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:48.809
Chris?

01:02:50.103 --> 01:02:51.563
Are you okay?

01:02:51.603 --> 01:02:53.063
Breathe, hey, hey, hey, breathe.

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:54.065
Breathe, buddy.

01:02:54.106 --> 01:02:54.898
Chris, Chris, look at me.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:55.817
Look me in the eye.

01:02:55.858 --> 01:02:56.900
Chris, look me in the eye.

01:02:56.943 --> 01:02:58.028
You are okay.

01:02:58.068 --> 01:02:59.195
Chris, what
happened to your face?

01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:01.322
It was the cat.

01:03:01.364 --> 01:03:02.240
What do you...
Chris?

01:03:02.282 --> 01:03:03.908
There's no cat in there.

01:03:03.949 --> 01:03:06.994
- Chris!
- No, come back.

01:03:07.036 --> 01:03:07.870
Chris!

01:03:08.996 --> 01:03:10.414
Chris, come back.

01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:13.335
Dude,
where are you going?

01:03:13.376 --> 01:03:14.169
Please?

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:15.420
I'm done.

01:03:15.461 --> 01:03:16.628
I'll give
you another $300...

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:17.463
This has nothing to
do with your money!

01:03:17.505 --> 01:03:18.715
Get your hand off me!

01:03:18.757 --> 01:03:19.548
Chris, it's just one more day.

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:21.425
Danni, I am done, no!

01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:22.634
Chris!

01:03:22.677 --> 01:03:23.803
Danni, you've got to
help me keep him here, okay?

01:03:23.844 --> 01:03:24.721
I'm trying.

01:03:24.762 --> 01:03:26.806
Mike, can you put the
camera down please!

01:03:26.847 --> 01:03:27.891
Shit.

01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:28.891
Chris?

01:03:28.932 --> 01:03:30.976
Chris, please come back.

01:03:31.018 --> 01:03:32.394
Come on, come on.

01:03:36.148 --> 01:03:40.069
Christopher,
where are you going?

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:41.403
I'm done, Danni.

01:03:41.445 --> 01:03:42.947
I'm done.

01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:43.947
I can't no more.

01:03:43.989 --> 01:03:44.948
Chris, please.

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:46.951
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:03:46.992 --> 01:03:50.079
You can't bail on me, Chris.

01:03:50.121 --> 01:03:51.247
You can't on Mike either.

01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:54.125
Do you know what
just happened up there?

01:03:54.166 --> 01:03:56.460
I can not do this anymore.

01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:57.461
Are you sure just didn't like

01:03:57.503 --> 01:03:58.630
scratch yourself by accident?

01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:00.548
Are you kidding me?

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:02.175
Are you kidding me?

01:04:02.217 --> 01:04:03.009
Stop!

01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:04.259
Christopher!

01:04:04.302 --> 01:04:05.929
I was dragged in
there by something!

01:04:05.969 --> 01:04:06.971
There is a reasonable
explanation for it.

01:04:07.012 --> 01:04:08.056
Literally everything.

01:04:08.097 --> 01:04:09.056
- Reasonable?
- Yes!

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:10.307
You're kidding me, Danni.

01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:11.558
No!

01:04:11.601 --> 01:04:13.061
Maybe Mike, maybe he
gave you something,

01:04:13.103 --> 01:04:14.854
maybe it was those
sleeping pills

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:15.939
and all that stuff
he keeps giving you.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.065
- Maybe it's a hallucinogen...
- This place is wrong,

01:04:17.106 --> 01:04:18.565
this place is evil.

01:04:18.608 --> 01:04:21.611
And if he's fucking around
with us, then he's evil, too.

01:04:21.652 --> 01:04:23.362
I'm done with him!

01:04:25.197 --> 01:04:26.907
Come with me.

01:04:26.949 --> 01:04:27.826
I can't.

01:04:27.867 --> 01:04:29.077
Come with me, I'm
leaving in one minute.

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:30.662
I cannot stay here anymore.

01:04:30.704 --> 01:04:33.331
I can't walk out on
my responsibilities.

01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:35.583
I can't just leave Mike and
Nic just hanging like that.

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:36.458
Danni.

01:04:37.376 --> 01:04:38.628
Something happened.

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.547
Please come with me.

01:04:42.715 --> 01:04:44.134
I can't, Chris.

01:04:46.135 --> 01:04:47.137
Christopher.

01:04:54.393 --> 01:04:57.563
Mike, are you serious right now?

01:04:57.605 --> 01:04:59.565
Mike, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:01.025
Danni, come on, please?

01:05:01.067 --> 01:05:02.527
No, Chris is out
there freaking out.

01:05:02.568 --> 01:05:03.987
Like we should really...

01:05:04.028 --> 01:05:04.945
we should pack our
stuff, we should go.

01:05:04.987 --> 01:05:05.989
Danni, Danni please

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.199
just stop for a second.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.576
We can't leave.

01:05:09.617 --> 01:05:10.577
What was that?

01:05:10.617 --> 01:05:12.036
What just happened?

01:05:12.077 --> 01:05:13.954
I don't know, he had
a nervous breakdown.

01:05:13.996 --> 01:05:16.665
I am just as freaked
out by it as you are!

01:05:16.708 --> 01:05:19.586
Then why can't
we just go, okay?

01:05:19.626 --> 01:05:21.378
Did you see what
happened to Chris?

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.005
We have to go, Mike.

01:05:23.047 --> 01:05:24.381
Yes, I saw what
happened to him!

01:05:24.423 --> 01:05:26.717
But we can't leave, Danni!

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.552
I'm sorry.

01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:31.014
Jess is making the
bulk of our income.

01:05:31.056 --> 01:05:34.934
I make very little money off
my ad revenues for the vlog.

01:05:34.976 --> 01:05:37.936
And now we have a
baby on the way.

01:05:37.978 --> 01:05:40.731
Do you know how
terrifying that is?

01:05:40.773 --> 01:05:43.400
I need this sponsorship,
you don't understand.

01:05:43.443 --> 01:05:46.028
I need it because if I
can't provide for her,

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:46.945
she's going to leave me.

01:05:46.987 --> 01:05:49.239
Maybe not in a week,
maybe not in a month,

01:05:49.282 --> 01:05:52.577
but eventually, she's going
to realize that I am useless.

01:05:52.619 --> 01:05:57.082
And then she's going to
leave and I cannot lose her.

01:05:58.875 --> 01:05:59.708
I can't...

01:06:03.253 --> 01:06:05.714
Mike, I really
wanna be here for you

01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:07.675
as a friend right now, okay?

01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:09.969
But I am not comfortable.

01:06:11.596 --> 01:06:13.264
I know, I'm sorry.

01:06:16.684 --> 01:06:17.518
Why?

01:06:18.519 --> 01:06:19.353
Why this?

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.648
Why do we have to be here?

01:06:25.025 --> 01:06:27.319
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.614
Mike.

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:32.157
Mike, look at me.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:43.168
It's confusing, okay?

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:44.044
I just...

01:06:45.463 --> 01:06:49.134
Things that other people
find disgusting and

01:06:49.842 --> 01:06:51.135
terrifying,

01:06:53.221 --> 01:06:54.139
there's a disconnect.

01:06:54.179 --> 01:06:56.515
It doesn't affect me that way.

01:06:57.516 --> 01:06:59.810
It feels good for me to
see those things, okay?

01:06:59.853 --> 01:07:01.604
And I know that sounds

01:07:01.646 --> 01:07:02.564
twisted but

01:07:04.315 --> 01:07:05.733
that's just always how it's been

01:07:05.775 --> 01:07:07.152
and even when my
parents adopted me,

01:07:07.193 --> 01:07:08.278
they were terrified about it.

01:07:08.318 --> 01:07:10.112
You were adopted?

01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:13.742
Mike, I didn't even know that.

01:07:16.661 --> 01:07:17.746
Apparently,

01:07:19.706 --> 01:07:21.791
when I was living
with my birth mom,

01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:24.543
I saw something
really disturbing

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:28.088
and I don't know what it was.

01:07:29.715 --> 01:07:33.177
I feel terrible
about it but look,

01:07:33.219 --> 01:07:35.554
we are so close to finishing.

01:07:35.597 --> 01:07:37.182
Okay, we just...

01:07:37.222 --> 01:07:40.684
My followers just are expecting
us to go to the basement.

01:07:40.726 --> 01:07:42.853
That's the only thing that
we need to shoot, that's it.

01:07:42.896 --> 01:07:43.730
Okay?

01:07:49.402 --> 01:07:50.235
Please?

01:07:53.864 --> 01:07:55.074
Okay.

01:07:55.909 --> 01:07:57.744
Thank you so much.

01:07:58.702 --> 01:07:59.579
Thank you.

01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:01.122
I'm sorry.

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:02.374
Let's try to get
ahold of Chris.

01:08:02.414 --> 01:08:03.248
Yeah.

01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:08.755
It's crazy to think
how many people just

01:08:08.797 --> 01:08:10.590
look across the street,
walk by everyday without

01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:14.260
knowing all the shit
that went down here.

01:08:16.261 --> 01:08:17.720
Yeah, it's freaky.

01:08:20.307 --> 01:08:23.353
Hey, I'm really sorry
you got so scared.

01:08:23.395 --> 01:08:25.188
What happened was not cool.

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:26.897
It's okay, it's...

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:28.148
I mean,

01:08:28.942 --> 01:08:32.153
there's a reason for
everything, right?

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.407
We just gotta figure
out what it was.

01:08:36.698 --> 01:08:38.242
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:38.283 --> 01:08:41.871
Looks like somebody's
a big fan of you.

01:08:41.912 --> 01:08:43.747
Dude, get out of here!

01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:45.792
Dude, bye.

01:08:49.962 --> 01:08:51.505
Wow, linger much.

01:08:53.966 --> 01:08:57.761
Christopher still
not texting you back?

01:08:57.804 --> 01:08:58.930
No.

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:00.264
Danni, camera.

01:09:00.305 --> 01:09:02.140
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:04.935
Mike.

01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:09.189
Is that the old lady
from the room we went to?

01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:10.108
Oh my God.

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:11.774
Her friend must have
jumped or something.

01:09:11.818 --> 01:09:12.652
Oh my God.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.822
Why would she do this?

01:09:17.198 --> 01:09:19.283
This is different, I...

01:09:20.702 --> 01:09:22.703
Different how?

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:27.834
It's not removed.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:29.210
It's not like it
is in a picture.

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:33.381
I don't know, it's
just different, okay?

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:36.966
Mike,
Mike, we should go.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:37.801
Why?

01:09:37.844 --> 01:09:38.636
Just, come on.

01:09:38.676 --> 01:09:40.305
Just walk.

01:09:40.345 --> 01:09:42.849
Guys, get your
camera out of here.

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:44.099
Don't look
back, don't look back,

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:44.934
don't look back.

01:09:44.975 --> 01:09:46.518
Please.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.810
Who's following us?

01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:51.524
I don't
know, I don't know.

01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:53.399
I don't see anybody.

01:09:54.444 --> 01:09:55.528
Shit, shit.

01:09:55.569 --> 01:09:56.820
Come on, come on, come on!

01:10:01.242 --> 01:10:02.327
Come on, come on,
come on, Danni.

01:10:10.001 --> 01:10:11.836
Who was that?

01:10:11.877 --> 01:10:12.753
What are you doing?

01:10:12.796 --> 01:10:15.298
Throwing him off.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.007
Mike, hurry.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:20.220
There's
the other elevator.

01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:24.682
Shit!

01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:27.560
Why are we running?

01:10:27.601 --> 01:10:29.520
Because he's
clearly after us, Mike.

01:10:29.561 --> 01:10:30.979
I think he
just wants to scare us.

01:10:31.021 --> 01:10:32.023
Oh fine, if you
wanna hang back and chit chat,

01:10:32.064 --> 01:10:34.317
just be my guest.

01:10:34.359 --> 01:10:35.527
Where are we?

01:10:35.568 --> 01:10:37.237
These are
the low income floors.

01:10:37.278 --> 01:10:38.195
Which way do we go?

01:10:38.238 --> 01:10:39.030
I don't know.

01:10:39.072 --> 01:10:39.989
That way, that way.

01:10:42.408 --> 01:10:44.536
They made me do this.

01:10:47.454 --> 01:10:48.414
Wait, are you okay?

01:10:48.456 --> 01:10:49.416
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:10:49.457 --> 01:10:50.250
Keep going.

01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:51.292
Mike, come on!

01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:54.295
How do we get out of here?

01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:56.256
I don't know.

01:10:58.048 --> 01:11:00.551
Danni, Danni, Danni, the door.

01:11:01.677 --> 01:11:02.554
Did you see that?

01:11:02.595 --> 01:11:03.387
See what?

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:04.847
Mike, come on.

01:11:04.889 --> 01:11:05.765
Okay.

01:11:05.806 --> 01:11:08.393
Going down.

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:09.978
Oh shit.

01:11:15.315 --> 01:11:16.568
Where's the stairs?

01:11:16.609 --> 01:11:17.652
It's gotta be
somewhere around here.

01:11:24.074 --> 01:11:26.036
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:11:26.077 --> 01:11:27.619
Move, move!

01:11:32.876 --> 01:11:34.085
Mike, where's the key?

01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:35.337
I dropped the
key, I dropped the key.

01:11:35.377 --> 01:11:36.420
Please go get it.

01:11:38.797 --> 01:11:39.715
Thank you.

01:11:39.757 --> 01:11:40.966
No, no, no, no.

01:11:41.885 --> 01:11:43.595
Please, please.

01:11:43.636 --> 01:11:44.888
Where's the key?

01:11:44.929 --> 01:11:46.431
Please.

01:11:46.472 --> 01:11:47.431
Christopher!

01:11:54.855 --> 01:11:57.399
Holy shit, was
that the guy from the alley?

01:11:57.442 --> 01:11:58.443
The drug dealer?

01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:00.653
Oh, Chris.

01:12:02.447 --> 01:12:04.615
I wanna go home please.

01:12:06.408 --> 01:12:07.451
Chris,
thank you so much.

01:12:07.493 --> 01:12:09.411
Hey, no one came back for you.

01:12:09.453 --> 01:12:10.954
He ran down the fire escape.

01:12:10.997 --> 01:12:12.957
You guys okay?

01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:15.793
No, far from it.

01:12:15.835 --> 01:12:17.545
I'll walk you out.

01:12:17.587 --> 01:12:18.505
You coming?

01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:22.133
Mike, come with us.

01:12:22.175 --> 01:12:23.009
Please come...

01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:24.886
I can't, I can't.
Nic's here and the equipment.

01:12:24.927 --> 01:12:25.720
I can't leave.

01:12:25.761 --> 01:12:26.679
Guys, guys.

01:12:31.016 --> 01:12:32.519
Fuck.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.062
God damnit.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.859
Nic?

01:12:40.902 --> 01:12:42.654
Nic, Nic, oh my God.

01:12:42.695 --> 01:12:44.488
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:45.657
Nic, come on.

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:49.327
Nic, Nic, Nic, come on.

01:12:49.368 --> 01:12:50.161
Come on, come on.

01:12:50.203 --> 01:12:51.287
Come on.

01:12:51.328 --> 01:12:52.121
Oh my God, Nic.

01:12:52.162 --> 01:12:53.163
What's wrong?

01:12:53.206 --> 01:12:53.998
What's wrong?

01:12:54.039 --> 01:12:55.125
Look at me please?

01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:56.376
Bad thoughts.

01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:03.841
Okay, okay.

01:13:03.882 --> 01:13:04.675
Come here.

01:13:04.717 --> 01:13:05.510
Come here.

01:13:05.551 --> 01:13:06.385
No, no, no, no.

01:13:11.181 --> 01:13:12.891
Ms. Eply?

01:13:12.934 --> 01:13:14.394
It's about Nic.

01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:17.396
Jesus, what happened?

01:13:18.981 --> 01:13:21.984
Hi, Mrs. Eply, thank
you so much for coming.

01:13:22.027 --> 01:13:23.485
I'm sorry, okay?

01:13:23.528 --> 01:13:24.487
I don't know what
happened to her.

01:13:24.529 --> 01:13:26.031
Honey, honey, what's wrong?

01:13:26.072 --> 01:13:27.574
Please talk to us.

01:13:29.492 --> 01:13:30.284
Will you drive please?

01:13:30.326 --> 01:13:31.953
I wanna sit in
the back with her.

01:13:31.994 --> 01:13:33.121
I'm so sorry.

01:13:33.162 --> 01:13:35.539
I'm gonna be calling you!

01:13:35.582 --> 01:13:38.418
Thanks for bringing her down.

01:14:09.783 --> 01:14:10.700
Hi.

01:14:10.742 --> 01:14:11.576
Jess.

01:14:13.787 --> 01:14:15.538
Are you okay?

01:14:15.579 --> 01:14:17.582
Jess, why are you crying?

01:14:17.623 --> 01:14:20.001
'Cause I had a dream.

01:14:20.042 --> 01:14:21.627
It was a bad dream.

01:14:23.796 --> 01:14:26.048
I feel like you're in
danger and I need you

01:14:26.091 --> 01:14:27.676
to come home, okay?

01:14:28.885 --> 01:14:29.802
Jess, I'm sorry.

01:14:29.844 --> 01:14:30.804
I can't come home yet.

01:14:30.845 --> 01:14:31.637
Okay?

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.847
I just...

01:14:32.889 --> 01:14:33.931
There are things that
I have to do here.

01:14:33.972 --> 01:14:35.766
What do you have to do?

01:14:35.809 --> 01:14:38.269
I need you here with me.

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:39.895
And I...

01:14:39.938 --> 01:14:40.855
I'm scared.

01:14:42.106 --> 01:14:43.942
Jess, come on, okay?

01:14:43.983 --> 01:14:45.193
Please.

01:14:45.234 --> 01:14:46.152
You know we need the
money and I can't.

01:14:46.194 --> 01:14:49.030
I can work overtime
until I can't anymore.

01:14:49.072 --> 01:14:51.533
I just need you to come home.

01:14:51.573 --> 01:14:52.408
Stop!

01:14:53.326 --> 01:14:56.496
Jess, you should never ever
have to work overtime again

01:14:56.537 --> 01:14:59.832
and I can finish here, I just...

01:14:59.873 --> 01:15:02.126
Mike, are you kidding?

01:15:02.167 --> 01:15:05.963
This is dangerous and I
know that you know it too

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:08.717
so can you just come home?

01:15:08.757 --> 01:15:10.010
I don't know.

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:14.681
I think I made a mistake
and I have to finish.

01:15:14.722 --> 01:15:18.309
Okay, and then I'll
be home for you, okay?

01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:19.309
I swear.

01:15:19.351 --> 01:15:21.604
But I can't leave yet.

01:15:21.645 --> 01:15:23.063
Why?

01:15:23.105 --> 01:15:24.273
Jess.

01:15:24.314 --> 01:15:25.399
Come on.

01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:26.234
Why do you have to finish it?

01:15:26.275 --> 01:15:27.234
You answer me please.

01:15:27.277 --> 01:15:28.194
I can't...

01:15:28.235 --> 01:15:29.820
Just answer me, why do
you have to finish it?

01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:32.323
You can't come home to your...

01:15:32.364 --> 01:15:34.617
To your baby, are you kidding?

01:15:34.658 --> 01:15:36.536
Jess, I love you most, okay?

01:15:36.578 --> 01:15:37.704
No, Mike.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.127
Okay, everybody.

01:17:49.168 --> 01:17:50.795
Live feed time.

01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:52.881
Making the final descent.

01:17:54.966 --> 01:17:56.468
I hope you can
see the feed okay.

01:17:56.509 --> 01:17:57.676
It's spotty.

01:18:00.262 --> 01:18:03.432
Keep going, Mike, keep going.

01:18:03.475 --> 01:18:05.769
Just 330 more subscribers.

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.270
Just 330 more subscribers.

01:18:11.899 --> 01:18:12.692
Wallace?

01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:13.526
Michael.

01:18:13.568 --> 01:18:14.360
Oh God, Michael.

01:18:14.402 --> 01:18:15.487
Where are you now?

01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:18.365
I'm heading towards
the hotel basement, why?

01:18:18.405 --> 01:18:20.699
I beg
you, please get out of there.

01:18:20.742 --> 01:18:23.119
I found out what happened
to the little boy

01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:24.871
who escaped his
father, the detective.

01:18:24.912 --> 01:18:27.748
He's the one
behind all this, isn't he?

01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:29.793
Behind scaring us
the last few nights.

01:18:29.833 --> 01:18:31.126
No!

01:18:31.168 --> 01:18:31.961
No, Michael.

01:18:32.002 --> 01:18:33.170
What?

01:18:33.212 --> 01:18:34.421
The boy was you.

01:18:34.463 --> 01:18:35.590
Wallace,
what did you say?

01:18:35.631 --> 01:18:38.342
The little
was you.

01:18:45.391 --> 01:18:48.478
Only 330
more subscribers.

01:19:04.034 --> 01:19:06.787
All right, this looks familiar.

01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:20.844
Get in there.

01:19:22.177 --> 01:19:23.012
Got it.

01:19:29.853 --> 01:19:33.523
Part of me was hoping
that wouldn't work.

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:54.501
This does not smell good.

01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:03.385
Oh, there are the mannequins
that we saw on the drone.

01:20:08.099 --> 01:20:08.932
Okay.

01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:13.188
Guess we're going this way.

01:20:17.984 --> 01:20:19.486
What was that?

01:20:19.527 --> 01:20:22.489
Oh, there's nothing
in there, okay.

01:20:31.956 --> 01:20:32.832
Okay, okay.

01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:36.168
All right.

01:20:47.971 --> 01:20:48.889
What the hell?

01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:51.266
Keep going, Mike.

01:20:51.309 --> 01:20:54.186
Keep going, keep
going, keep going.

01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:56.980
What is that?

01:21:00.694 --> 01:21:04.114
Oh man, the smell is
way worse down here.

01:21:06.615 --> 01:21:07.533
The boiler.

01:21:10.369 --> 01:21:11.203
Okay.

01:21:13.664 --> 01:21:15.625
Here, kitty kitty.

01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:17.377
Here, kitty kitty.

01:21:18.293 --> 01:21:19.336
What?

01:21:19.378 --> 01:21:20.963
No way.

01:21:21.006 --> 01:21:22.048
No way.

01:21:23.048 --> 01:21:24.341
Is that our drone?

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:27.345
What the hell?

01:21:27.386 --> 01:21:29.389
Oh, it's right...

01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:32.016
It's right above the vent
where Meghan Kim was.

01:21:34.728 --> 01:21:35.895
Who's there?

01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:37.980
Who's there?

01:21:46.948 --> 01:21:47.949
Hello?

01:21:53.203 --> 01:21:54.956
Oh my God, oh God.

01:21:54.997 --> 01:21:56.206
Oh God.

01:21:58.376 --> 01:21:59.543
Who is that?

01:22:01.421 --> 01:22:02.255
Hello?

01:22:05.132 --> 01:22:08.470
Who turned that light on?
What was that?

01:22:14.184 --> 01:22:16.269
Who turned that light on?

01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:35.622
If this is some sick prank,
you're doing a great job.

01:22:39.751 --> 01:22:41.127
What the fuck?

01:22:45.547 --> 01:22:46.382
Hey!

01:22:48.259 --> 01:22:49.386
I know somebody's here!

01:22:49.426 --> 01:22:50.469
Who did this?

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.773
Shit.

01:23:02.815 --> 01:23:04.108
Shit, shit.

01:23:08.488 --> 01:23:09.447
No way.

01:23:09.488 --> 01:23:10.781
No way, no way, no way.

01:23:13.409 --> 01:23:15.036
Who's watching me?

01:23:17.079 --> 01:23:18.122
Is that?

01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:22.168
Is that Tony's notebook?

01:23:24.128 --> 01:23:26.131
Why is this page marked?

01:23:27.841 --> 01:23:30.176
Oh, what the fuck?

01:23:30.217 --> 01:23:31.051
No way.

01:23:31.094 --> 01:23:32.177
No, no, no, no.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:33.471
No way.

01:23:33.512 --> 01:23:35.765
No, this can't be right.

01:23:38.184 --> 01:23:39.019
Oh, God!

01:23:40.353 --> 01:23:42.021
Who's there?

01:23:42.063 --> 01:23:43.230
What the fuck?

01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:46.192
Who is that?

01:23:53.198 --> 01:23:54.033
Hey!

01:23:55.159 --> 01:23:56.077
Who's there?

01:23:56.118 --> 01:23:57.619
God damnit.

01:23:57.662 --> 01:23:59.079
Oh, God.

01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:01.082
Okay, okay, okay.

01:24:01.123 --> 01:24:02.751
I'm not afraid of you!

01:24:04.586 --> 01:24:05.753
Come out here!

01:24:12.676 --> 01:24:13.594
Shit, shit.

01:24:18.766 --> 01:24:19.600
Okay.

01:24:37.702 --> 01:24:39.119
Oh God, oh God.

01:24:53.051 --> 01:24:53.843
I'm sorry!

01:24:53.885 --> 01:24:55.220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

01:24:55.261 --> 01:24:57.222
Please leave me alone.

01:25:06.271 --> 01:25:07.731
Get out of the way!

01:25:07.774 --> 01:25:09.275
No
one's allowed in here.

01:25:09.317 --> 01:25:10.150
Hey!

01:25:51.484 --> 01:25:52.485
Hey, guys.

01:25:53.987 --> 01:25:54.820
Mike here.

01:25:56.905 --> 01:25:59.908
I'm sorry about the late post.

01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:03.788
I know some of you have
been worried about me.

01:26:06.207 --> 01:26:10.628
I'm streaming this live so I
can answer your questions but

01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:14.673
before I get to that, I
wanted to show you this.

01:26:16.967 --> 01:26:19.804
It seems I broke my hand.

01:26:19.845 --> 01:26:21.180
In three places.

01:26:24.559 --> 01:26:27.896
The police were
questioning me for hours

01:26:28.854 --> 01:26:29.688
about

01:26:31.608 --> 01:26:33.943
the body in the boiler room.

01:26:44.412 --> 01:26:46.831
I reached 50,000 subscribers,

01:26:47.957 --> 01:26:49.959
which I really, really

01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:52.212
appreciate you guys for.

01:26:56.256 --> 01:26:59.510
I've been trying to reach Chris,

01:26:59.551 --> 01:27:01.261
and Nic, and Danni

01:27:02.764 --> 01:27:04.682
but they don't respond.

01:27:06.768 --> 01:27:08.395
I don't blame them.

01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:12.606
I just, I hope they're okay.

01:27:15.359 --> 01:27:18.362
And I haven't talked
to Jess either, but

01:27:18.404 --> 01:27:19.405
I just, I...

01:27:23.283 --> 01:27:26.704
I just don't know what
to say to her and...

01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:32.793
I had a lot of time to think.

01:27:33.670 --> 01:27:34.837
A lot of time.

01:27:38.632 --> 01:27:40.551
And I think the best
decision right now

01:27:40.592 --> 01:27:43.304
is to take a sabbatical
from the vlog.

01:27:43.345 --> 01:27:44.805
I'm trying to

01:27:44.847 --> 01:27:47.641
put this weekend behind me,

01:27:47.684 --> 01:27:49.269
think about things.

01:27:52.104 --> 01:27:52.938
I've

01:27:57.569 --> 01:28:00.363
cut together some stuff from

01:28:00.404 --> 01:28:02.032
our trip this weekend.

01:28:06.536 --> 01:28:08.288
When I was in that basement,

01:28:08.328 --> 01:28:09.371
I was

01:28:10.414 --> 01:28:13.335
so alone and scared and I
just kept thinking about

01:28:13.376 --> 01:28:17.838
how alone and scared
Meghan Kim must have been.

01:28:17.881 --> 01:28:19.507
I'm sorry, this footage is crap.

01:28:19.548 --> 01:28:23.094
Nic would have done a much
better job editing it.

01:28:23.136 --> 01:28:24.346
But I...

01:28:26.389 --> 01:28:29.893
I decided to do a short
documentary like this

01:28:29.934 --> 01:28:33.396
on the homeless
issue in downtown.

01:28:33.438 --> 01:28:35.023
Just, I need to try

01:28:36.065 --> 01:28:40.987
and put something positive out
into the world for a change.

01:28:43.655 --> 01:28:44.698
I need to try

01:28:46.408 --> 01:28:50.871
to come to terms with what I
know about my birth father.

01:28:53.457 --> 01:28:56.835
Which means I might
lose the sponsorship.

01:28:59.171 --> 01:29:01.006
But if I do, I mean,

01:29:03.134 --> 01:29:03.967
so be it.

01:29:07.846 --> 01:29:08.889
Come on, turn on.

01:29:08.931 --> 01:29:10.349
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:29:13.395 --> 01:29:15.146
Oh fuck, fuck.

01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:19.150
Jess!

01:29:19.192 --> 01:29:19.984
Jess, is that you?

01:29:58.814 --> 01:30:00.399
Yo, bitches.

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:01.568
Terrible Tyler here.

01:30:01.609 --> 01:30:04.112
And today, I am stoked to find

01:30:05.238 --> 01:30:07.407
DropTheMike's actual crib,

01:30:09.158 --> 01:30:11.994
where his fiance
was decapitated.

01:30:12.037 --> 01:30:13.204
Sick!

01:30:13.246 --> 01:30:16.791
And what's even sicker is that
DropTheMike totally bolted.

01:30:16.832 --> 01:30:19.043
Cops can't find him anywhere.

01:30:19.085 --> 01:30:20.127
How epic is that?

01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:23.465
Dude,
it says do not cross.

01:30:23.506 --> 01:30:24.341
Dude.

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.967
Not anymore.

01:30:28.595 --> 01:30:30.555
Tune in tonight where
I try to find out

01:30:30.596 --> 01:30:33.182
what happened to DropTheMic and

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:38.479
I'll show you how I got
this awesome artifact.

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.230
Like, comment,

01:30:40.273 --> 01:30:42.025
and subscribe to my
channel, bitches.

01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:44.778
I post new videos every Monday.

01:30:44.819 --> 01:30:45.653
Peace!
