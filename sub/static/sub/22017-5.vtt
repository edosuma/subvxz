00:00.151 --> 00:02.860
<i>- Previously on</i> Star...
<i>- Ladies, I was up all night last night,</i>

00:02.862 --> 00:04.617
<i>working on a new track, and
I'm telling you right now,</i>

00:04.620 --> 00:06.135
<i>- it is hype.
- Nice ice.</i>

00:06.137 --> 00:07.117
<i>- That new?
- No.</i>

00:07.123 --> 00:08.789
<i>My mom got this for
me a while ago.</i>

00:08.825 --> 00:10.936
You know, you and I are just
doing the same thing right now,

00:10.960 --> 00:13.661
trying to impress Charles Floyd,
but I guess Daddy's not coming?

00:13.696 --> 00:15.029
Get the hell out of my party.

00:15.064 --> 00:16.597
Yo, Pops thinks I'm no good.

00:16.632 --> 00:19.133
Well, that's because he
thinks you're like me.

00:19.168 --> 00:21.313
You got to live with the choices
you made five months ago,

00:21.337 --> 00:22.748
so if you want to
drop a track on them,

00:22.772 --> 00:23.782
you got to come through me.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.206
I just need a shot here, Lottie.

00:25.441 --> 00:27.007
You're not my father.
I don't know you.

00:27.043 --> 00:28.209
You're a stranger.

00:28.244 --> 00:29.377
No one in the music industry

00:29.412 --> 00:31.946
- wants to touch me or my music.
- Why not? It's dope.

00:31.981 --> 00:34.181
But it ain't mine.
It's your cousin's.

00:34.217 --> 00:36.784
<i>Maybe you're right. Maybe I
do pull stunts for attention.</i>

00:36.819 --> 00:39.019
<i>Game recognize game.</i>

00:41.324 --> 00:42.701
- Derek? Derek?
- Don't come over here.

00:42.725 --> 00:44.703
- Stay away! Stay away.
- Stop! What are you doing? Stop.

00:44.727 --> 00:47.106
- This is unnecessary.
- Hey! Move! Get out of my face, girl!

00:47.130 --> 00:51.432
I should've known your ass would
not stop lying. You can't.

00:53.569 --> 00:55.881
First, you lie about your mama being dead.
Now about our baby?

00:55.905 --> 00:58.739
- Oh, no.
- It's time for your ass to go.

00:58.775 --> 01:01.175
- I... I said I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too, okay?

01:01.210 --> 01:03.878
I'm sorry I fell in love
with your fake ass.

01:03.913 --> 01:06.447
There isn't anything fake about
me trying to protect you, Derek.

01:06.482 --> 01:09.250
I ain't no charity case.

01:09.355 --> 01:10.955
Get out my house!

01:10.990 --> 01:12.623
- We done!
- Good!

01:12.658 --> 01:14.191
Good, Derek, 'cause I'm sick

01:14.227 --> 01:16.327
of rolling your ass around
that wheelchair anyway!

01:21.434 --> 01:23.701
Come back, little Sheba.
Where is your mind?

01:23.736 --> 01:26.136
I said take <i> all</i> the trash out.

01:26.172 --> 01:29.473
- I'm sorry.
- You gonna be sorry when you get off work.

01:29.508 --> 01:32.877
Come help me close this shop up.

01:33.252 --> 01:36.220
Crazy ass.

01:36.255 --> 01:39.189
Just as foolish as
she know how to be.

01:47.466 --> 01:48.832
Is it locked?

01:48.867 --> 01:50.300
- It is locked.
- You sure?

01:50.336 --> 01:52.536
I am positive.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.870
How you doing?

01:53.906 --> 01:55.739

02:16.495 --> 02:19.029
- At least I got a bed.
- It's not gonna happen.

02:19.064 --> 02:21.398
Oh, come on. We been
at this for a week.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.467
Aren't you tired of
covering up cameras

02:23.502 --> 02:25.013

backseat of my car?

02:25.037 --> 02:27.004

02:29.275 --> 02:31.575
You know you really want this.
Just sex.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.810
I don't have time for this
conversation right now.

02:33.846 --> 02:35.812
I don't need distractions
before the show.

03:24.296 --> 03:26.530
Stop asking questions.

03:26.565 --> 03:28.098
Move!

03:33.572 --> 03:35.472
Keep your hands off her.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.641
You can't touch her like that.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.343
Leave her alone! No.

03:39.378 --> 03:42.646
Where are you taking her?!

03:47.920 --> 03:51.421
I've been catching flies
with this new barber chair.

03:51.457 --> 03:54.124
Bruce, I done told you,
don't date the customers.

03:54.159 --> 03:56.159
I ain't dating 'em, sister.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.196
Ugh! You so nasty.

03:59.231 --> 04:00.731
Ugh, child.

04:00.766 --> 04:02.199
What you doing here so early?

04:02.234 --> 04:04.068
Well, "morning" to
everybody, too.

04:04.103 --> 04:05.103
- Good morning.
- What up, girl?

04:05.104 --> 04:06.800
I couldn't sleep. At all.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.338
Yo, they took her.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.474
They took Karen.
What did you do?

04:10.509 --> 04:12.109
I didn't do nothing.

04:12.144 --> 04:14.184
Maybe they got their own
rules about missing curfew.

04:14.273 --> 04:16.250
No, it's 'cause you don't
like her, that's why.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.225
I don't like that you
went AWOL with her.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.394
Don't forget I'm still trying
to get you out of there.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.807
Simone, you should
be surprised that

04:21.831 --> 04:23.297
they're still letting
<i> you</i> sign out.

04:23.332 --> 04:24.765
You don't even know her, okay?

04:24.800 --> 04:26.400
I'm gonna let Simone
check her feelings

04:26.435 --> 04:29.269
while we talk about this
performance tomorrow night.

04:31.173 --> 04:34.108
- What do you want?
- I'm hungry.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.876
What is there to talk about?

04:35.911 --> 04:37.611
It's a club gig.

04:37.646 --> 04:39.113
We can do this in our sleep.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.759
Yeah, and Ayanna should be
cool with us right now.

04:40.783 --> 04:42.516
We just helped her
sign GiGi Nixon.

04:42.551 --> 04:44.296
No, you don't get it. Tomorrow's
not just about Ayanna.

04:44.320 --> 04:47.821
The A&R execs are gonna be
scoring your performance.

04:47.857 --> 04:50.991
So you score high with them,
she can't come for us.

04:51.027 --> 04:52.637
She gonna have to put
y'all in that showcase,

04:52.661 --> 04:54.506
so this could be <i> the</i> performance
that gets us there.

04:54.530 --> 04:56.330
All right, well, if it's
that big of a deal,

04:56.365 --> 04:58.310
maybe we should come up with our
new name and announce it there.

04:58.334 --> 05:00.801
New name? I kind of
liked the old one.

05:00.836 --> 05:04.705
Anyway... I think we
should do "Bad Bish."

05:04.740 --> 05:07.541
Nah. I think the bridge still
needs work on that one.

05:07.576 --> 05:09.610
I want you to do "Time."

05:09.645 --> 05:12.312
- "Time" is so slow.
- I know it's slow,

05:12.348 --> 05:14.481
- but the hook on that is so dope.
- Oh, you know...

05:14.517 --> 05:16.784
- And you can show off your vocals...
- Hey, you could

05:16.819 --> 05:19.119
flip the melody in that last
verse in the other song.

05:19.155 --> 05:21.355
Hey, y'all got something
to eat in here?

05:21.390 --> 05:24.158
Jahil, I told you we don't
need no backseat managers.

05:24.193 --> 05:26.326
And are you gonna put some
food in my refrigerator?

05:26.362 --> 05:27.861
Old habits, my bad.

05:27.897 --> 05:29.997
Look, I'm not trying to step
on anybody's toes here.

05:30.032 --> 05:31.832
I'm in the producing
game now, anyway.

05:31.867 --> 05:33.834
- Oh.
- Ayanna, she, uh...

05:33.869 --> 05:35.814
she's all hip to my new sound,
right, so we got a meeting

05:35.838 --> 05:38.138
to talk about the next steps.
Look,

05:38.174 --> 05:39.606
soon as them hits
start coming in,

05:39.642 --> 05:41.542
y'all be banging on my front door.
Watch.

05:41.577 --> 05:44.611
Yeah, before it gets
ticketed and towed.

05:44.647 --> 05:46.914
Good one.

05:51.921 --> 05:54.388
So this is where
my money is going.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.957
Hmm.

05:59.261 --> 06:01.795
Well, I like what you've
done with the place.

06:01.831 --> 06:04.298
But?

06:04.333 --> 06:06.066
Well, I also liked what

06:06.102 --> 06:09.336
Andre Harrell did back at
Motown back in the day.

06:09.371 --> 06:12.372
Before he was fired for
all his lavish spending.

06:12.408 --> 06:16.710
What's important is
your label's talent.

06:16.745 --> 06:18.356
If you'd come to my launch
event, as you promised,

06:18.380 --> 06:20.581
- you would have seen for yourself.
- Oh.

06:20.616 --> 06:22.449
Don't get sensitive on me, YaYa.

06:22.485 --> 06:24.251
I signed GiGi Nixon.

06:24.286 --> 06:26.987
I know how much you
regretted losing her.

06:27.022 --> 06:29.656
You know that you'll never get
credit for GiGi's career.

06:29.692 --> 06:32.759
I found her. I
cultivated her talent.

06:32.795 --> 06:34.382
If you want props
in this business,

06:34.390 --> 06:35.990
you're gonna have to
find your own GiGi.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.921
I assume that this is what
the showcase is about.

06:38.956 --> 06:40.389
It is.

06:40.424 --> 06:41.824
My artists are good.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.325
I ride them hard.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.184
And I'm taking a page
out of your playbook.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.030
Hmm.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.131
I'm having an old school A&R
roundup tomorrow night.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.534
And also creating more
pressure for yourself.

06:52.570 --> 06:54.837
You always said pressure
makes diamonds.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.672
It worked.

06:56.707 --> 07:01.810
Just look at how successful
your siblings have become.

07:01.846 --> 07:04.513
YaYa...

07:05.916 --> 07:08.350
I hope this label

07:08.386 --> 07:11.086
is a win for all the
things you wanted.

<i>Just calm down. I
need the money.</i>

07:23.601 --> 07:27.503
But it's gonna take a while,
but that's what I have to do.

07:27.631 --> 07:30.599
No. It's not that easy.

07:30.668 --> 07:33.069
I tried that.

07:33.804 --> 07:37.539
Yeah. Yeah, of course I
know what we discussed.

07:37.575 --> 07:39.274
There's a way in.

07:39.310 --> 07:41.877
I just need to find it.

07:41.912 --> 07:44.246
You need to relax.

07:50.521 --> 07:52.488
<i>Jahil?</i>

07:52.523 --> 07:54.223
Jahil. Like, you know,
like a high eel.

07:54.258 --> 07:55.557
Like...

07:55.593 --> 07:57.292
- You feel me?
- I don't feel you.

07:57.328 --> 07:58.905
That's the corniest thing I ever heard.
Miss Floyd?

07:58.929 --> 08:01.497
- It's all right.
- Um, a Jahil is here.

08:01.532 --> 08:04.399
You didn't waste any time
getting on my books.

08:04.435 --> 08:06.335
You can't afford to wait.

08:06.370 --> 08:09.104
That cocky charm is not going
to help you in this office.

08:09.139 --> 08:11.206
I want a shot at
producing my tracks

08:11.242 --> 08:12.908
with some of your artists.

08:12.943 --> 08:15.544
All of my artists are currently
working with producers.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.446
Proven and dependable talent.

08:17.481 --> 08:20.282
But you want me to
take a chance on you?

08:20.317 --> 08:22.651
A chance on the sound.

08:22.686 --> 08:25.521
At the moment, I don't have any
artist for you to work with.

08:25.556 --> 08:29.024
But I will buy your beats.

08:29.059 --> 08:30.959
What's your price?

08:30.995 --> 08:32.693
No sale.

08:32.730 --> 08:35.163
Get out. Bye, Jahil.

08:35.198 --> 08:36.765
Come on, my man.

08:40.304 --> 08:42.437
I see you.

08:42.472 --> 08:44.339
Excuse me?

08:44.375 --> 08:46.542
You're just like me.

08:46.577 --> 08:48.510
I mean, maybe you sit
behind that big-ass desk,

08:48.546 --> 08:50.913
but you just as hungry,
and you getting old.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.549
You're the only member of your
family who ain't got a trophy

08:53.584 --> 08:55.228
up on the mantelpiece;
that's 'cause you ain't

08:55.252 --> 08:56.852
doing nothing different.

08:56.887 --> 08:58.854
This is your last stop
before people start saying,

08:58.889 --> 09:00.556
"You know what? She
ain't got it."

09:00.591 --> 09:02.991
You know what I can give you
is hot, and we both know

09:03.027 --> 09:04.226
you want it.

09:04.295 --> 09:06.728
Bye, Jahil.

09:17.471 --> 09:19.037
Hey. Hey, yo.

09:19.072 --> 09:21.940
How's my sexy little white girl?

09:21.975 --> 09:23.775
What's up, mama?

09:23.811 --> 09:26.178
What'd I say about
keeping it on the low?

09:26.213 --> 09:27.679
How low you want to get?

09:27.714 --> 09:29.325
I don't want my name in
anybody's mouth unless

09:29.349 --> 09:31.583
it's about me and my music.
That's how low.

09:31.618 --> 09:35.086
Okay. My bad. I be good.

09:35.122 --> 09:36.488
I've been through this before.

09:36.523 --> 09:37.989
- Yeah, I bet you have.
- Yeah.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.625
You know what?

09:40.661 --> 09:43.128
♪ When them killers at
your front door... ♪

09:43.163 --> 09:45.664
- Who's this? You know him?
- Oh, that's my boy, Lucky.

09:45.699 --> 09:47.499
I see you got the full
package on the whip.

09:47.534 --> 09:50.335
- I used your credit to get it.
- That's good credit 'cause

09:50.370 --> 09:52.048
- you got it the same day.
- Good to see you, baby.

09:52.072 --> 09:55.574
Good to see you, man. Yo, Lucky,
this is, um, this is Star.

09:55.609 --> 09:57.576
- What's up?
- How you doing?

09:57.611 --> 10:00.378
This the girl you
be talking about?

10:00.414 --> 10:01.913
You got some black in you?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.560
Come on, man. What you doing?
You can't say...

10:03.584 --> 10:05.695
No, this is not the girl that
he's been talking about.

10:05.719 --> 10:08.954
- We just talked about this.
- Hey, don't trip. He's good.

10:08.989 --> 10:10.500
- This is good people. This is my family.
- All right.

10:10.524 --> 10:11.524
Nice to meet you, Lucky.

10:11.558 --> 10:13.291
It's nice to meet you too, Star.

10:13.327 --> 10:14.559
You stupid, boy.

10:14.595 --> 10:17.162
Stop stalking me,
especially at work.

10:17.697 --> 10:20.765
I'm actually here to see Simone.

10:20.801 --> 10:23.702
Give me a second. I'm sorry.

10:23.737 --> 10:26.071
It's not gonna happen.

10:26.106 --> 10:29.741
You know how hard it was
for me to get sober?

10:29.776 --> 10:31.810
I'm doing everything
I can, Star.

10:31.845 --> 10:34.946
- I know I missed a lot.
- Uh, what?

10:34.982 --> 10:36.548
Mama killing herself?

10:36.583 --> 10:39.317
Or were you referring to
Simone <i>trying</i> to kill herself?

10:39.353 --> 10:41.197
Or Simone smoking herself
into a juvie facility,

10:41.221 --> 10:43.555
where she still is now?

10:43.590 --> 10:46.524
You're too late, bro.
Just move on.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.526
Your mom's death weighs
on me every day.

10:48.562 --> 10:50.729
You got to know that.

10:50.764 --> 10:52.564
I came here to check
in on Simone,

10:52.599 --> 10:54.466
do right by all of you for once.

10:54.501 --> 10:56.301
We are family.

10:56.336 --> 10:59.437
No. We're not family.

11:03.243 --> 11:05.844
You good?

11:05.879 --> 11:08.346
So good.

11:08.382 --> 11:10.982
Okay.

11:12.819 --> 11:15.987
If you got him, you
got me, a'ight?

11:18.425 --> 11:19.991
Appreciate you.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.826
Of course.

11:21.895 --> 11:24.329
I will see you later.

11:24.364 --> 11:26.998
- Not in public.
- Yeah, private.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.034
Stop looking at me, Noah.

11:29.102 --> 11:30.835
I'm not looking at you.

11:30.871 --> 11:32.971
I'm looking at you.

11:33.006 --> 11:35.240
- Stop looking at her. Look at the car.
- Really?

11:35.275 --> 11:37.242
Got to keep your eyes on the car.
Show me the car.

11:37.277 --> 11:38.655
I don't see what the problem...
All right, bro.

11:38.679 --> 11:40.657
Come on, check it out. Yeah,
check it out, check it out.

11:40.681 --> 11:43.381
You had to. You had
to go this crazy.

11:44.785 --> 11:46.451
Hey!

11:46.486 --> 11:48.920
What you want?

11:48.956 --> 11:50.322
I need to talk to you.

11:50.357 --> 11:51.456
Ayanna send you?

11:51.491 --> 11:53.591
First of all, Ayanna
don't send me nowhere.

11:53.627 --> 11:56.227
Man, ain't you, like, her
glorified assistant...

11:56.263 --> 11:58.563
Don't worry about all that.

11:58.598 --> 12:02.233
I saw the way you handled her,
so I want to help you out.

12:02.269 --> 12:04.402
I know the artist she's been
sleeping on at Midtown.

12:04.438 --> 12:05.770
Well, who is it?

12:05.806 --> 12:07.150
I thought all of
Midtown's artists

12:07.174 --> 12:08.518
were already paired
with a producer.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.008
Nah, he's not signed yet.

12:10.043 --> 12:11.977
He's free and clear. He's
a free agent right now.

12:12.012 --> 12:14.045
- You?
- Yeah, me.

12:14.081 --> 12:17.048
Who's corny now?

12:17.084 --> 12:18.783
Hey. Hey, listen, man.

12:18.819 --> 12:20.452
I'm serious.

12:20.487 --> 12:23.254
I hear every piece of music
that comes in that office.

12:23.290 --> 12:25.657
And you got it. You
got the sound.

12:25.692 --> 12:27.392
I want it.

12:27.427 --> 12:29.127
All right.

What's the matter?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.846
Nothing.

13:21.882 --> 13:23.915
Brody showed up again
trying to see you.

13:25.018 --> 13:26.251
I kicked his ass out.

13:26.286 --> 13:27.952
What?

13:27.988 --> 13:30.522
So, you just sent him away
without even checking with me?

13:30.557 --> 13:32.223
Yeah, we talked about this.

13:32.259 --> 13:33.958
We're not gonna let him play us.

13:33.994 --> 13:36.061
Yeah, you should let
me speak for myself.

13:36.096 --> 13:37.762
Stop acting like a
child about it.

13:37.798 --> 13:40.598
I ain't a child.

13:40.634 --> 13:42.634
You know what? Y'all can
rehearse on your own.

13:42.669 --> 13:44.769
I got therapy.

13:44.805 --> 13:46.549
It's not like you pay
attention to me anyways.

13:46.573 --> 13:49.007
- Come on, Simone.
- Bye.

13:49.042 --> 13:51.443
I'm gonna go to the studio

13:51.478 --> 13:54.446
while they work out
whatever that is... again.

13:54.481 --> 13:56.148
And what you gonna work out?

13:57.283 --> 14:00.384
You know, everything ain't
got to be about them.

14:02.773 --> 14:04.205
How you and Derek doing?

14:04.241 --> 14:07.375
I'm good, Miss Carlotta.

14:12.716 --> 14:14.516
Yo, why do you watch
this stuff, bro?

14:14.551 --> 14:16.918
That is funny. What
you talking about?

14:16.987 --> 14:18.020
- Huh.
- Man, it's good to...

14:18.021 --> 14:19.065
Man, it's good to
have you back, bro.

14:19.089 --> 14:21.222
- It's good to be back.
- For real. Man.

14:21.258 --> 14:22.802
Get out of here. I don't
even want that, anyway.

14:22.826 --> 14:23.826
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

14:25.629 --> 14:28.129
Boy, you crazy, boy. Man.

14:29.533 --> 14:31.266
- Give me a minute, man.
- Uh-huh.

14:31.301 --> 14:33.234
I already know.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.648
- Don't go too far, bro.
- A'ight, a'ight. For sure, for sure.

14:35.672 --> 14:37.072
What's up?

14:37.107 --> 14:38.707
Okay, so...

14:41.211 --> 14:42.844
I'm looking for an
evolved Noah Brooks,

14:42.879 --> 14:45.513
not the black Bieber
you used to be.

14:45.549 --> 14:46.748
Yo, Bieber the homie.

14:46.783 --> 14:48.683
Elevate your vocals.

14:48.719 --> 14:50.496
A faster tempo wouldn't hurt,
and get rid of that boy.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.520
He's a convicted felon;
that's a problem for you

14:52.556 --> 14:53.788
and your deal.

14:53.824 --> 14:55.523
Get him off the premises.

14:55.559 --> 14:57.236
First of all, I'm not
getting rid of nobody.

14:57.260 --> 14:59.260
And Lucky's my family.

14:59.296 --> 15:01.129
Get that through
your head, sister.

15:01.164 --> 15:02.530
This is business.

15:02.566 --> 15:04.432
And, Noah...

15:06.570 --> 15:09.738
you have one more time
to call me "sister."

15:12.776 --> 15:15.276
Don't worry.

15:15.312 --> 15:18.680
I'll be on point tomorrow night...
boss.

15:33.363 --> 15:35.030
- Something like that?
- You're right in the pocket, bro.

15:35.031 --> 15:36.031
Let me just, uh...

15:36.166 --> 15:38.366
Let me, let me tweak this
chorus a little bit, though.

15:38.402 --> 15:41.002
Okay, tweak it, man. Do
what you got to do, man.

15:41.038 --> 15:42.871
You got it. Your sound is

15:42.906 --> 15:44.884
the exact thing we've been
looking for at Midtown, man.

15:44.908 --> 15:47.509
What you mean "his sound"?

15:47.544 --> 15:49.177
Hey, Angel.

15:49.212 --> 15:51.813
Hey, listen, man, I was
gonna send for you.

15:51.848 --> 15:53.782
My dad told me you was
a broke-ass hustler,

15:53.817 --> 15:55.817
but I looked up to you, Unc.

15:55.852 --> 15:57.018
- Wait, Unc?
- Yeah.

15:57.054 --> 15:58.520
And that's my music.

15:58.555 --> 16:00.955
- That's your nephew?
- Uh, yeah.

16:00.991 --> 16:03.491
And you're definitely not
gonna take that away from me.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.660
Angel, listen. Hey.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.007
I can't see nothing
but your teeth.

16:15.146 --> 16:17.024
Your black ass is the only
one that can get away

16:17.048 --> 16:18.347
with that joke.

16:18.383 --> 16:21.250
What's wrong?

16:21.286 --> 16:24.120
Life.

16:24.188 --> 16:25.821
I'll figure it out.

16:25.857 --> 16:28.424
I mean, let me help.

16:31.229 --> 16:32.862
Uh, no.

16:32.897 --> 16:34.764
And you can back up a bit.

16:34.799 --> 16:37.133
I have a man at home,
and I'm very happy.

16:37.168 --> 16:38.467
Okay?

16:38.503 --> 16:40.636
I... I know. I...

16:40.672 --> 16:42.905
You're sitting in
the dark all alone.

16:42.941 --> 16:45.841
If you want to talk about
whatever, I'm... I'm here.

16:45.877 --> 16:48.010
And I'm not trying
to hit on you.

16:50.381 --> 16:52.014
I... I'm fine.

17:05.730 --> 17:08.731
Hey.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.665
Thought I'd come see you.

17:10.702 --> 17:12.034
Brought you some food.

17:12.069 --> 17:14.170
You want to sit?

17:20.912 --> 17:22.877
I'm sorry you're in here.

17:22.914 --> 17:25.548
I mean, it ain't your fault.

17:25.583 --> 17:28.017
It's not like you're my
real dad or anything.

17:29.921 --> 17:32.188
Where you been all these years?

17:32.223 --> 17:33.689
Simone, I'm sorry.

17:33.725 --> 17:35.491
I was so screwed up back then.

17:35.526 --> 17:38.160
What I did was wrong.

17:38.196 --> 17:40.596
You were always like
my daughter to me.

17:40.631 --> 17:44.000
Is that why you left?

17:44.035 --> 17:46.535
I was selfish. I was in
and out of the house...

17:46.571 --> 17:48.604
You left 'cause of me.

17:48.639 --> 17:50.539
No.

17:50.575 --> 17:52.775
Me and Mary were
never gonna make it.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.344
It had nothing to do
with you, Simone.

17:55.380 --> 17:58.914
I was an idiot for not sticking
around for you and Star.

17:58.950 --> 18:01.751
That's for sure.

18:01.786 --> 18:04.186
I'm here now, though.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.987
_

18:09.761 --> 18:12.395
Simone, come on.
Stop being stupid.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.897
I know this ain't about that
girl that's in there with you.

18:14.932 --> 18:17.633
- Ain't that your girl?
- Just call me back.

18:17.668 --> 18:19.735
You know you got me worried.

18:19.771 --> 18:21.670
- Hey.
- I'll see you later at the party.

18:21.706 --> 18:23.706
Hey.

18:24.041 --> 18:26.509
What happened earlier?
With your pops.

18:26.544 --> 18:28.611
I saw you had a little heat.
What'd he do?

18:28.646 --> 18:31.347
He's not my dad.

18:31.382 --> 18:34.383
- And nothing for you to worry about.
- I'm not.

18:34.419 --> 18:37.653
I just know that family
pop-ups ain't exactly...

18:37.688 --> 18:40.056
It's not exactly fun times.

18:40.091 --> 18:44.060
I mean, if my dad popped
up, we'd be fighting.

18:44.095 --> 18:46.996
I don't have time for a
heart-to-heart right now.

18:47.031 --> 18:49.298
I got stuff to do.

19:03.681 --> 19:06.816
You remember that night
when you said I had issues?

19:08.719 --> 19:10.753
He's why.

19:17.728 --> 19:20.729
I appreciate you pulling
all this for me.

19:20.765 --> 19:23.165
Uh, is Angela here?

19:23.201 --> 19:25.334
I wanted to help you personally.

19:25.369 --> 19:28.204
Oh, that's sweet.

19:28.239 --> 19:31.941
Do you happen to have any
jewelry I can look at

19:31.976 --> 19:34.810
- that would go with this?
- We do.

19:34.846 --> 19:38.814
But that bracelet you stole
would probably look best.

19:38.850 --> 19:41.584
Excuse me?

19:41.619 --> 19:45.187
We have you on
camera, Miss Crane.

19:48.559 --> 19:50.826
Angel, look. Neph, would
you just come on in?

19:50.862 --> 19:53.629
Please, just come on in. Come
on in and sit down, okay?

19:53.664 --> 19:55.564
You're right. I lied to you.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.567
But I... Listen, I got real
interest at a good label,

19:58.603 --> 19:59.913
and paired with
that dude's voice?

19:59.937 --> 20:02.338
I mean, we... we can go all
the way with this, man.

20:02.373 --> 20:03.506
- "We"?
- Yeah, "we."

20:03.541 --> 20:05.341
We share the publishing,
you and me.

20:05.376 --> 20:08.377
You want 50% of something
or 100% of nothing?

20:08.412 --> 20:09.745
Think about it.

20:09.780 --> 20:11.714
It's up to you.

20:11.749 --> 20:13.582
Huh?

20:13.618 --> 20:16.685
Well, let's get that guy back in
here because I like his voice.

20:16.721 --> 20:18.954
He's got to hit that
chorus differently.

22:02.726 --> 22:05.628
I had an abortion.

22:08.499 --> 22:11.900
The doctor said he wasn't
ever gonna walk again,

22:11.936 --> 22:15.037
so I didn't want to put
any more pressure on him.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.373

24:32.797 --> 24:34.174
we should've done
this different song.

24:34.198 --> 24:36.299
- A different song?

shot or something?

28:02.914 --> 28:05.615
- I told you to leave us alone.
- I invited him.

28:05.650 --> 28:09.185
And I told you, no matter
what she said she wanted,

28:09.220 --> 28:10.453
to stay away from her.

28:10.488 --> 28:12.455

see what you doing?

- I got room.
- Why, Simone?

28:22.767 --> 28:24.500
Huh? Why are you letting
him do this to you?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.769
'Cause I lost somebody
already, Star,

28:26.805 --> 28:28.449
and I don't want to lose
somebody else again.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.940

28:37.148 --> 28:39.916
He did this to both of us,

28:39.951 --> 28:41.684
and some things you
cannot come back from.

28:41.719 --> 28:44.754
Maybe he deserves
a second chance.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.367

You know, you don't
