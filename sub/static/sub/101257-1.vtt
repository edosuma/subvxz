14:18.131 --> 14:18.758
I'm sorry.

14:18.883 --> 14:20.385
Where are my manners?

14:20.553 --> 14:21.889
I'm Sam Turner.

14:22.056 --> 14:23.935
It's a pleasure, man.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.688
Hey.

14:25.855 --> 14:26.397
What do you say?

14:29.738 --> 14:31.282
I'm sure we can get it out.

14:31.407 --> 14:32.911
Really?

14:33.078 --> 14:33.704
Yes!

14:33.871 --> 14:34.539
You're amazing.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.708
Thank you.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.752
Robin, get in and
give it gas when I say.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.388
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

14:46.522 --> 14:47.565
Now!

14:47.732 --> 14:50.738
[engine revving]

14:53.076 --> 14:54.245
Ha!

14:54.412 --> 14:55.038
Yes!

14:58.169 --> 15:01.050
[cheering]

15:01.175 --> 15:01.885
Oh my gosh!

15:02.011 --> 15:04.473
I cannot thank you folks enough.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.520
Truly.

15:06.603 --> 15:09.860
So what‐‐ what brings
you guys out here anyway?

15:09.943 --> 15:11.237
Uh, fishing.

15:11.404 --> 15:13.199
We just heard they salted
the stream up the way.

15:15.538 --> 15:17.082
I know these woods like
the back of my hands,

15:17.249 --> 15:19.128
and that dream is not
worth swimming in.

15:19.253 --> 15:20.965
Someone sent you
to the wrong spot.

15:21.090 --> 15:24.598
I, kind of, figured that
when we didn't catch anything.

15:24.765 --> 15:27.562
Well, look, I heard
they were dumping fish

15:27.645 --> 15:28.731
a little further up that way.

15:28.898 --> 15:30.359
I can show you where it's at.

15:30.526 --> 15:31.402
Right?

15:31.695 --> 15:32.446
I mean, you helped
me with my truck.

15:32.614 --> 15:34.868
Make us even.

15:34.993 --> 15:35.745
ROBIN: Our gear's back in.

15:35.912 --> 15:37.081
I don't know.

15:37.247 --> 15:39.920
I think we're just gonna
walk back to the camp.

15:40.003 --> 15:41.089
Just hold up.

15:41.214 --> 15:42.675
Just give us a second.

15:42.801 --> 15:43.385
Yeah.

15:46.474 --> 15:47.685
(WHISPERING) He seems nice.

15:47.852 --> 15:49.564
(WHISPERING) You
think everyone's nice.

15:49.689 --> 15:50.942
Have you seen the guy's car?

15:51.109 --> 15:52.277
It looks like he's living in it.

15:52.361 --> 15:54.825
Honey, please don't
let me go empty‐handed.

15:54.991 --> 15:56.537
Your dad will never
let me live it down.

15:56.662 --> 16:00.460
Look, I don't want to butt in,
but it's my own secret fishing

16:00.586 --> 16:01.462
spot.

16:01.672 --> 16:03.007
It's only a couple
of miles away.

16:03.133 --> 16:04.886
The other day, I caught a
trout bigger than she is.

16:10.565 --> 16:10.940
OK.

16:11.023 --> 16:11.692
‐ Yeah!
‐ Yeah!

16:11.817 --> 16:12.652
Let's do it.

16:12.819 --> 16:14.029
All right, hop in.

16:14.321 --> 16:14.948
I'll bring you back to your
car, and you can follow me

16:15.115 --> 16:15.783
from there.

16:15.950 --> 16:16.827
Boop‐boop!

16:16.952 --> 16:20.167
[chuckles]

16:20.292 --> 16:23.465
[car radio plays music]

16:37.493 --> 16:39.038
JAVIER: Like the back
of his hand, huh?

16:39.163 --> 16:42.127
It feels like we've been
driving around in circles.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.298
ROBIN: Don't be like that.

16:44.465 --> 16:45.927
How would you even
know where we are?

16:46.052 --> 16:48.473
The woods look exactly
the same everywhere.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.770
JAVIER: I'm pretty sure I've
seen that turn‐off, like, twice

16:50.895 --> 16:51.897
already.

16:52.022 --> 16:52.815
ROBIN: Come on, Javy.

16:52.941 --> 16:54.068
Be nice.

17:07.177 --> 17:10.685
[radio music stops]

17:12.564 --> 17:14.066
I must have been
daydreaming, man!

17:14.233 --> 17:15.360
I feel silly!

17:15.485 --> 17:18.241
I took a wrong turn
back at the fork!

17:18.408 --> 17:20.621
That's about two miles back!

17:20.746 --> 17:21.582
Yeah.

17:21.748 --> 17:22.332
Yeah.

17:27.719 --> 17:29.514
[sighs]

17:29.639 --> 17:31.518
So what should we do?

17:31.685 --> 17:34.189
Well, uh, we could
camp here for the night.

17:36.737 --> 17:38.448
I think we should head back.

17:38.616 --> 17:40.870
But it's getting dark, and
we already decided to camp

17:40.995 --> 17:42.289
out anyways.

17:42.540 --> 17:45.128
Yeah, we'll wake up bright
and early, catch those fish!

17:45.253 --> 17:46.422
We could get lost.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.761
And we don't want el
cuco to get us, right?

17:51.850 --> 17:53.019
OK!

17:53.144 --> 17:54.939
I guess we're
camping here tonight.

17:55.106 --> 17:55.941
Whoo!

17:56.067 --> 17:56.735
I love you.

18:00.826 --> 18:04.584
Javy, Javy, look, look, a deer!

18:04.751 --> 18:05.711
So beautiful!

18:05.836 --> 18:07.214
What are you doing?

18:07.339 --> 18:08.801
Bagging myself a deer!

18:08.926 --> 18:11.013
You wanna come?

18:11.138 --> 18:13.017
What do you think Dad's going
to think about your deer tacos?

18:13.142 --> 18:14.353
I don't know!

18:14.478 --> 18:17.150
He'll be too busy
eating my fish tacos!

18:17.317 --> 18:18.654

you saw the gun go off?

19:02.533 --> 19:03.744
Then what happened?

19:03.869 --> 19:07.042
[robin screaming, crying]

19:07.209 --> 19:11.885
Robin, you saw it, I
just handed him the gun.

19:12.010 --> 19:15.935
[robin sobbing]

19:27.207 --> 19:27.875
No.

19:30.088 --> 19:32.552
Robin, Robin,
Robin, Robin, Robin!

19:32.718 --> 19:34.137
Get back here!

get lost out there!

to get lost out there!

20:05.366 --> 20:07.788
You're going to get
hard out here, Robin!

20:07.914 --> 20:10.961
[grunting] Robin!

20:11.086 --> 20:12.255
It was an accident!

20:12.422 --> 20:13.550
You saw it was an accident!

20:13.717 --> 20:14.886
Hey!

20:15.053 --> 20:17.057
You need to calm down!

20:17.223 --> 20:18.267
OK?

20:18.392 --> 20:19.227
We have to get out of here!

20:19.394 --> 20:21.065
We have to go get help!

20:21.231 --> 20:23.444
OK?

20:23.570 --> 20:28.120
I was so upset,
I just took off.

20:28.245 --> 20:29.414
I got us lost.

20:35.719 --> 20:40.186
If Sam hadn't been there,
I don't think it‐‐ no, I‐‐

20:40.311 --> 20:44.988
I know I would have never found
my way out of those woods.

20:50.331 --> 20:51.876
Sam saved my life.

21:02.108 --> 21:03.805
CELESTE: It's orange?

21:03.972 --> 21:06.559
OK, OK, no tears.

21:06.685 --> 21:07.771
I've got this.

21:07.896 --> 21:09.274
I will send my
stylist Lucy over,

21:09.399 --> 21:12.154
and she will have you back
to blonde before you can say,

21:12.280 --> 21:12.655
I do.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.325
I promise.

21:14.450 --> 21:15.494
Perfect.

21:15.745 --> 21:18.500
And let me know how it
goes, and I will see you

21:18.667 --> 21:23.343
and the groom the day after
tomorrow for the cake tasting.

21:23.427 --> 21:25.389
OK.

21:25.556 --> 21:27.643
Mm!

21:31.109 --> 21:31.484
Hello?

21:35.034 --> 21:36.161
Yes, this is she.

21:39.667 --> 21:40.336
An accident?

21:43.675 --> 21:45.471
Javier?

21:45.596 --> 21:46.348
Oh my god!

Mom!

Oh!

21:53.528 --> 21:53.653
Oh!

Oh!

21:54.572 --> 21:55.032
It's awful!

21:55.199 --> 21:56.618
I just want to die, too.

Oh!

Mrs. Johnson.

21:58.705 --> 22:00.542
What's going on here?

22:00.709 --> 22:01.879
My son‐in‐law is dead?

22:02.046 --> 22:03.590
Why is my daughter being held?

22:03.758 --> 22:04.802
Ma'am, please, if
you'll come with me,

22:04.927 --> 22:06.679
I'll explain everything.

22:06.806 --> 22:07.974
Do I need to call a lawyer?

22:08.100 --> 22:10.897
SHERIFF WATKINS: Robin
is not under arrest.

22:11.106 --> 22:12.984
Why don't you come
on back to my office?

22:13.110 --> 22:14.863
No, no, no, no, no, Mom.

22:14.988 --> 22:15.865
Please, please.

22:16.032 --> 22:16.449
Don't leave me.
Please.

22:16.574 --> 22:17.368
No, no!

22:17.576 --> 22:18.620
Honey, I'm not going anywhere.

22:18.746 --> 22:19.705
Look, I'm just going
right over there.

22:19.832 --> 22:21.752
Look, you can see me.

22:21.877 --> 22:24.006
I promise.

22:24.132 --> 22:26.136
I am not leaving without you.

22:32.858 --> 22:35.905
[sam coughing]

22:41.750 --> 22:42.710
Javier was shot.

22:45.299 --> 22:48.388
It appears to be a
hunting accident for now,

22:48.472 --> 22:51.519
but until we complete
a proper investigation

22:51.644 --> 22:54.609
and autopsy, we're not
going to know a whole lot.

22:54.692 --> 22:55.904
Hunting accident?

22:56.070 --> 22:57.364
But with whose gun?

22:57.490 --> 23:00.412
Neither Javier nor my
daughter owned one.

23:00.537 --> 23:05.380
The gun belonged to
that man, Mr. Turner.

23:05.506 --> 23:06.090
But‐‐

23:08.595 --> 23:12.812
Apparently, when Mr. Turner
handed your son‐in‐law his gun,

23:12.979 --> 23:15.400
it accidentally went off.

23:15.567 --> 23:16.694
Robin said that‐‐

23:16.820 --> 23:19.617
Robin saw it happened?

23:19.785 --> 23:21.538
Oh!

23:21.704 --> 23:22.791
My poor baby.

23:22.999 --> 23:25.922
Oh my god, have you
called Javier's parents?

23:26.047 --> 23:27.299
Oh, I can't even imagine.

23:27.424 --> 23:29.972
They're going to be devastated.

23:30.097 --> 23:31.224
Where is he?

23:31.349 --> 23:33.270
His remains are
still out there.

23:33.395 --> 23:35.315
It'll be too dark for us
to do anything tonight,

23:35.482 --> 23:39.323
but believe me, we will
be out there first light.

23:39.490 --> 23:42.246
His remains?

23:42.413 --> 23:43.456
Oh my god.

23:43.582 --> 23:44.584
Look, take a breath.

23:46.922 --> 23:50.470
Let things settle,
and take Robin home.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.157
[sam coughs]

24:00.282 --> 24:02.036
She said I can
take you home now.

24:02.202 --> 24:03.330
No, Mom, please.

24:03.413 --> 24:05.083
Just bring me back
to your house.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.212
Shh, of course.

24:07.379 --> 24:08.340
That's what I meant.

24:08.883 --> 24:09.843
[sam coughs]

24:09.968 --> 24:14.477
Hey, Robin, uh, I'm‐‐

24:14.602 --> 24:18.944
I just wanna say I'm
sorry for everything.

24:19.070 --> 24:23.829
Um, Mom, this is Sam.

24:23.954 --> 24:27.796
Without him, I would have
never made it out of the woods.

24:27.879 --> 24:29.883
Sam Turner, Ma'am.

24:30.008 --> 24:30.802
[coughing]

24:30.968 --> 24:32.680
Thank you, Mr. Turner.

24:32.847 --> 24:36.187
For bringing Robin home safe.

24:36.312 --> 24:37.731
Of course.

24:37.899 --> 24:42.449
Hey, Robin, I just want you
to remember what I promised.

24:42.574 --> 24:45.580
I'm always going to be around,
no matter what happens.

24:45.748 --> 24:51.426
I'm keeping an eye
on you and your mom.

24:51.551 --> 24:52.887
Bye, Sam.

24:52.971 --> 24:55.726
[coughing continues]

24:58.273 --> 24:59.400
SHERIFF WATKINS:
All right, we're

24:59.567 --> 25:00.903
going to put you up
in a motel tonight,

25:01.028 --> 25:02.824
and I'll have the doc swing
by and check you out there.

25:02.949 --> 25:05.370
And then, tomorrow, we're going
to go back in those woods,

25:05.537 --> 25:08.209
and you're going to show
me what the heck happened.

25:08.334 --> 25:10.840
And let's just hope the
animals don't get to the body

25:10.965 --> 25:12.092
before we do.

25:12.259 --> 25:15.767
[coughing]

25:23.114 --> 25:24.658

25:24.785 --> 25:26.537
Why don't you lie
down for a little bit,

25:26.621 --> 25:29.001
and I will bring you
a cup of noodle soup?

25:29.126 --> 25:29.668
Mom!

25:29.795 --> 25:30.337
No!

25:30.504 --> 25:31.214
I'll be right back, baby.

25:31.339 --> 25:32.508
I'll be right back.

25:32.633 --> 25:33.928
Let me just get the phone.

25:34.053 --> 25:34.637
I'll be right back.

25:34.763 --> 25:35.305
I promise you.

25:35.472 --> 25:36.557
I promise you.

25:39.815 --> 25:40.775
Hello?

25:40.900 --> 25:45.743
Oh, I'm so, so sorry!

25:45.910 --> 25:49.083
Why don't‐‐ why don't
both of you come over?

25:49.250 --> 25:50.252
SAM: Robin.

25:50.377 --> 25:52.714
CELESTE: Yeah, Robin's here now.

25:52.841 --> 25:54.343
Great.

25:54.468 --> 25:55.679
I'll see you soon.

25:59.728 --> 26:01.315
That was Ana.

26:01.482 --> 26:03.570
She and Emiliano are
on their way over.

26:03.653 --> 26:04.363
No, no!

26:04.488 --> 26:05.908
I don't want to see them!

26:06.033 --> 26:07.703
Are you sure?

26:07.871 --> 26:08.496
What did I just say?

26:08.663 --> 26:10.125
I don't want to see them!

26:10.250 --> 26:11.419
All right, all right.

26:11.544 --> 26:16.679
I‐‐ I'll tell them
you're not up to it yet.

26:16.847 --> 26:19.310
I don't know
what to tell them.

26:19.476 --> 26:21.314
It's my fault he died!

26:21.480 --> 26:23.735
I don't know what to do
to make them feel better!

26:23.903 --> 26:24.236
I‐‐

26:24.361 --> 26:25.196
No, no, Robin!

26:25.363 --> 26:26.742
No one is blaming you.

26:26.867 --> 26:31.208
This was a tragic accident,
and everyone is struggling

26:31.375 --> 26:33.756
to come to terms with it.

26:33.881 --> 26:36.469
Now, Baby, I am here for
you, and I will help you

26:36.636 --> 26:37.805
in any way I can.

26:41.062 --> 26:42.064
Thanks, Mom.

26:42.189 --> 26:43.608
OK, uh, I'm sorry.

26:43.691 --> 26:45.988
I just need to see if
I can get a hold of Ana

26:46.155 --> 26:46.823
before she leaves.

26:57.094 --> 26:57.971
Stop it.

26:58.096 --> 26:59.306
Stop it.

26:59.390 --> 27:00.308
Just stop it.

27:00.433 --> 27:01.018
Stop it!

27:01.143 --> 27:01.644
Stop it!

27:01.770 --> 27:02.729
Stop it!

27:09.243 --> 27:11.873
SAM: (PANTING) Robin!

27:12.040 --> 27:12.332
Robin!

27:12.499 --> 27:13.251
Robin, get up!

27:13.418 --> 27:14.044
They're coming!

27:14.169 --> 27:15.338
They're coming!

27:15.547 --> 27:17.050
Robin!

27:17.175 --> 27:19.973
Come on, they're going to come,
and they're gonna kill us both!

27:20.098 --> 27:23.772
[panting]

28:15.542 --> 28:16.544
Good morning, sweetheart.

28:16.669 --> 28:17.337
How are you feeling?

28:17.462 --> 28:18.005
Hungry?

28:20.845 --> 28:23.349
Mom, it wasn't
a dream, was it?

28:23.474 --> 28:26.230
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.192
You're grieving.

28:28.317 --> 28:31.365
Take as long as you need.

28:31.490 --> 28:33.745
There is no time
limit when it comes

28:33.829 --> 28:36.375
to losing someone you love.

28:36.500 --> 28:40.633
Oh, that is so beautiful.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.435
Javy gave it to me.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.731
It was his grandmother's.

28:47.857 --> 28:50.236
I miss him so much.

28:50.361 --> 28:52.365
I know you do.

28:52.490 --> 28:54.620
What am I going to do?

28:54.746 --> 28:57.835
You're strong, Robin, much
stronger than you think.

28:58.002 --> 29:01.133
You're going to
get through this.

29:01.258 --> 29:05.475
And I'm going to be right
here with you the whole way.

29:05.642 --> 29:07.187
Thanks, Mom.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.817
Why don't you go take a bath
while I make us some breakfast,

29:10.026 --> 29:10.276
OK?

29:14.243 --> 29:14.953
SAM: It was an accident!

29:15.078 --> 29:16.957
You know it was an accident!

29:19.503 --> 29:20.798
(WHISPERING) Stop it.

29:20.965 --> 29:23.386
SAM: You're such a sweet girl.

29:23.511 --> 29:23.887
Stop it.

29:24.012 --> 29:24.471
Stop it.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.139
Stop it.

29:25.265 --> 29:25.598
Stop it.

29:25.682 --> 29:26.475
Stop it!

29:26.558 --> 29:29.523
Stop it!

29:29.690 --> 29:31.987
It's OK.

29:32.153 --> 29:32.822
Let it out.

29:32.989 --> 29:34.491
Cry, scream, whatever you want.

29:34.658 --> 29:35.535
Talk to me.

29:38.541 --> 29:42.967
It's all foggy
in my head, but I

29:43.092 --> 29:44.303
don't think it was an accident.

29:47.517 --> 29:52.820
I think‐‐ I think Sam
killed Javier on purpose.

30:09.478 --> 30:10.981
[Sam coughs]

30:11.148 --> 30:12.525
SHERIFF WATKINS:
What's your name?

30:12.692 --> 30:13.736
SAM: Sam Turner.

30:13.904 --> 30:15.531
SHERIFF WATKINS:
Where do you live?

30:15.741 --> 30:17.160
SAM: Here and there.

30:17.285 --> 30:19.081
SHERIFF WATKINS:
What do you mean?

30:19.247 --> 30:23.005
SAM: Well, I'm between
places at the moment.

30:23.130 --> 30:24.549
SHERIFF WATKINS: All right,
you got the baseline?

30:24.674 --> 30:25.761
We're good to do this?

30:25.928 --> 30:26.553
MAN: Yeah.

30:26.763 --> 30:27.597
Pretty good.

30:27.765 --> 30:28.892
All right.

30:29.059 --> 30:31.063
Let's get the hard
one out of the way.

30:31.230 --> 30:34.528
Did you shoot Javier Rivera?

30:34.611 --> 30:36.950
Yes.

30:37.075 --> 30:38.995
It was an accident.

30:39.121 --> 30:41.208
I would never hurt anyone.

30:41.375 --> 30:43.880
In your statement,
you said that you

30:44.047 --> 30:45.633
forgot to put the safety on.

30:45.759 --> 30:46.635
Is that correct?

30:46.803 --> 30:48.431
Yes.

30:48.597 --> 30:54.944
Um, I handed the gun to Javier,
but honestly, I was, kind of,

30:55.111 --> 30:57.657
distracted when I did it.

30:57.783 --> 31:00.621
Robin was, kind of,
flirting with me,

31:00.747 --> 31:01.958
making me uncomfortable.

31:02.125 --> 31:05.590
What exactly was
Mrs. Rivera doing?

31:05.757 --> 31:07.260
I don't‐‐

31:07.427 --> 31:08.429
I don't know.

31:08.596 --> 31:14.775
She‐‐ I could just tell
she liked me, you know.

31:14.984 --> 31:16.863
[coughing]

31:16.988 --> 31:20.119
So just to be
clear here, you're

31:20.286 --> 31:23.501
saying that Mrs. Rivera
flirted with you,

31:23.667 --> 31:27.300
and this distraction is what
made you shoot her husband?

31:27.467 --> 31:28.093
No.

31:28.302 --> 31:32.560
No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

31:32.685 --> 31:36.568
It's my fault. You know,
distracted or not, I should

31:36.693 --> 31:38.280
have checked the damn safety.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.117
SHERIFF WATKINS: After
Mr. Rivera was shot,

31:40.243 --> 31:41.871
did you move the body?

31:41.996 --> 31:42.831
Lord, no.

31:42.998 --> 31:44.251
No, I didn't touch him.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.045
Robin did.

31:48.171 --> 31:49.935
Robin did that?

31:50.061 --> 31:51.355
Yeah.

31:51.522 --> 31:53.860
Look, I don't want to
talk badly about Robin.

31:54.028 --> 31:55.697
She's a nice kid.

31:55.822 --> 32:00.290
But after the
accident, I thought she

32:00.290 --> 32:03.922
was a little out of control.

32:04.048 --> 32:08.452
So you think that a woman
being emotional after she's

32:08.620 --> 32:13.546
just watched her husband
die is out of control?

32:13.713 --> 32:17.512
I'm just telling you what I
saw and how it made me feel.

32:23.149 --> 32:26.573
Is everything you've
told me today the truth?

32:26.698 --> 32:28.075
Yes, ma'am.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.579
Honest truth, I swear it.

32:29.745 --> 32:32.292
[coughs]

32:35.831 --> 32:37.042
All right.

32:37.168 --> 32:38.378
[sam coughs]

32:38.503 --> 32:40.257
Thank you for your
cooperation, Mr. Turner.

32:40.382 --> 32:41.801
It's greatly appreciated.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.573
Where is she?

32:52.740 --> 32:54.953
I demand to speak
with the sheriff!

32:55.120 --> 32:56.916
Mrs. Johnson.

32:57.082 --> 32:59.712
Javier's death
was not an accident.

32:59.837 --> 33:01.174
Sheriff, I am so sorry.

33:01.341 --> 33:03.094
She just barged
in, all worked up.

33:03.220 --> 33:04.973
What did you do?

33:05.098 --> 33:06.768
That man is responsible!

33:06.894 --> 33:07.686
Mrs. Johnson‐‐

33:07.854 --> 33:09.315
What did you do,
you son of a bitch?

33:09.440 --> 33:11.653
Mrs. Johnson, the
middle of the station

33:11.820 --> 33:13.824
is not the place
to discuss this.

33:14.033 --> 33:14.367
What did you do?

33:14.492 --> 33:17.248
Mrs. Johnson!

33:17.414 --> 33:19.752
I don't know what
she's talking about.

33:19.878 --> 33:21.714
Robin, tell her I didn't
do anything wrong.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.266
Mr. Turner, you're free to go.

33:26.391 --> 33:27.518
CELESTE: Free to go?

33:27.685 --> 33:29.105
Did you hear what I just said?

33:29.230 --> 33:30.399
This man‐‐

33:30.524 --> 33:35.117
Mrs. Johnson, Robin,
in my office right now.

33:47.391 --> 33:48.853
You are letting that man go!

33:48.936 --> 33:52.526
Look, I know that this
is a traumatic time for you

33:52.693 --> 33:55.532
both, that it is not
easy to lose a loved one.

33:55.741 --> 33:59.540
However, you need to
calm the heck down.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.419
I can't have you
causing a ruckus

34:01.586 --> 34:02.838
and threatening witnesses.

34:02.964 --> 34:04.342
Oh, he's no witness.

34:04.425 --> 34:05.802
You need to arrest the man.

34:05.929 --> 34:07.097
Arrest him for what?

34:07.222 --> 34:09.644
You don't just point at
someone and I put them in jail.

34:09.769 --> 34:11.941
That is not how the law works.

34:12.066 --> 34:14.695
You need to tell the sheriff
exactly what you told me.

34:14.820 --> 34:18.536
She needs to know what kind
of man she's dealing with.

34:18.703 --> 34:21.209
He murdered Javier!

34:21.376 --> 34:22.461
Just‐‐ Mom, I just‐‐

34:22.586 --> 34:24.215
I just‐‐ I just
want to go home, OK?

34:24.382 --> 34:27.221
Please, tell her, baby.

34:27.388 --> 34:28.682
It's really important.

34:28.807 --> 34:30.560
It's all just flashes
of memory in my head.

34:30.727 --> 34:31.939
I don't remember!

34:32.106 --> 34:33.233
OK?

34:33.566 --> 34:35.989
It's just‐‐ it's all
blurry, but I think Sam‐‐

34:36.155 --> 34:38.911
Sam kidnapped me, held
me hostage in the woods.

34:39.036 --> 34:39.913
Hostage?

34:40.122 --> 34:42.751
Javier, my husband,
after he got shot,

34:42.877 --> 34:46.050
Sam kept me in the woods
for a really long time.

34:50.350 --> 34:51.895
OK.

34:52.021 --> 34:53.732
Robin, I need you to
tell me something,

34:53.941 --> 34:56.821
because I'm in the dark here.

34:56.989 --> 34:59.618
Now, I thought that
this happened yesterday,

34:59.785 --> 35:01.999
when you and Mr. Turner
came into the station.

35:02.124 --> 35:05.464
But you're telling me
that's not the case?

35:05.589 --> 35:08.011
When exactly did Javier die?

35:10.640 --> 35:12.770
On the second day, Monday.

35:12.937 --> 35:16.444
And then, Sam just took me
really deep into the woods,

35:16.611 --> 35:18.656
and I was just lost.

35:18.782 --> 35:20.619
I didn't know where I was, and‐‐

35:20.827 --> 35:23.500
I thought we were going
to be there forever.

35:23.666 --> 35:25.170
That's five days ago.

35:25.337 --> 35:28.844
You were in the woods
with this man for five days?

35:28.969 --> 35:30.138
I don't know!

35:30.305 --> 35:31.140
OK?

35:31.349 --> 35:32.726
I don't know what
happened to me!

35:32.852 --> 35:35.398
I don't know what‐‐

35:35.524 --> 35:36.317
I don't know!

35:44.333 --> 35:44.750
SAM: Come on.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.631
Come on.

35:47.714 --> 35:51.180
Javy said people die out here.

35:51.305 --> 35:53.309
Even if it's just Sunday hikes.

35:53.434 --> 35:54.645
Yeah, I reckon.

35:54.812 --> 35:55.814
You know, there's lots
of places to get lost,

35:55.940 --> 35:57.317
and no one would
ever find your body.

36:03.371 --> 36:03.830
(CRYING) I just‐‐

36:03.998 --> 36:06.752
I can't stop shaking.

36:06.879 --> 36:08.924
I'm really thirsty.

36:09.049 --> 36:12.347
I guess you should've
thought of that before you ran.

36:12.514 --> 36:13.391
That came out wrong.

36:13.516 --> 36:15.020
I have a canteen in my pack.

36:17.316 --> 36:18.818
OK, well, I guess this
is as good a place as any

36:18.986 --> 36:21.574
to stop for the night.

36:21.741 --> 36:23.996
Have you ever made camp before?

36:24.121 --> 36:26.125
OK, well, let's
get some firewood,

36:26.292 --> 36:27.962
and I'll get a fire going.

36:31.594 --> 36:32.679
I said, let's get some wood.

36:32.763 --> 36:33.640
(CRYING) I'm just‐‐

36:33.723 --> 36:34.851
I'm just really tired.

36:34.976 --> 36:36.187
I just want to stay here.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.538
Hey.

36:45.705 --> 36:48.086
It's not safe out here.

36:48.253 --> 36:50.131
We have to stick
together, Robin.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.390
If you don't do what I
say, you're going to die.

37:01.529 --> 37:02.698
Good girl.

37:02.823 --> 37:05.245
I‐‐I'll go with you.

37:05.412 --> 37:08.376
You do what I say, and uh,
listen to me when I talk.

37:08.501 --> 37:10.213
I appreciate that.

37:10.297 --> 37:12.134
Hey, uh, I know you
probably don't know,

37:12.301 --> 37:14.555
but I'm a lot more
important than you realize.

37:14.722 --> 37:17.436
I do something special, and I'm
not supposed to talk about it.

37:17.602 --> 37:20.567
It's the kind of thing you
get on the need‐to‐know basis,

37:20.692 --> 37:24.993
but I figured I could tell you.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.082
You know, that's why you
have to do everything I say.

37:28.207 --> 37:29.961
It's like we're on
a secret mission.

37:32.215 --> 37:35.597
I'm your commanding officer.

37:35.764 --> 37:39.229
(SHOUTING) Attention, soldier!

37:39.355 --> 37:40.523
Stop!

37:40.648 --> 37:42.486
Stop!

37:42.611 --> 37:43.780
Come back!

37:43.947 --> 37:45.784
I was just fooling!

37:45.951 --> 37:48.456
(CRYING) Please!

37:48.623 --> 37:52.089
Please let me go!

37:52.255 --> 37:54.385
Please just leave me alone!

37:54.510 --> 37:55.136
Robin!

38:01.065 --> 38:02.985
I told you not to run.

38:03.152 --> 38:05.657
You should just let‐‐

38:05.824 --> 38:06.700
leave me alone.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.287
You just leave me here.

38:08.413 --> 38:10.083
I'll just‐‐ I'll
just slow you down.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.212
[sound of helicopter overhead]

38:12.337 --> 38:14.716
Look, if, I left you
here, you wouldn't be alive.

38:14.843 --> 38:15.886
OK?

38:16.053 --> 38:17.013
I told you, I'm
a special person.

38:17.139 --> 38:18.599
My name's not Sam.

38:18.724 --> 38:20.103
It's Kent.

38:20.228 --> 38:22.441
I work for a secret
government agency.

38:22.607 --> 38:24.194
It's called The Organization.

38:24.319 --> 38:24.820
That helicopter?

38:24.988 --> 38:26.782
That's them.

38:26.950 --> 38:29.413
They're trying to track me.

38:29.538 --> 38:32.335
They're the reason I had
to kill your husband.

38:34.798 --> 38:37.679
He figured out what I was, and
he couldn't be allowed to live.

38:37.847 --> 38:39.600
OK?

38:39.683 --> 38:40.435
OK, let's go.

38:43.399 --> 38:49.369
He said that The
Organization made him do it.

38:49.495 --> 38:53.544
That's‐‐ that's
all I can remember.

38:53.711 --> 38:56.050
OK, Robin.

38:56.217 --> 38:58.346
Is everything you've
told me today true?

39:02.187 --> 39:03.397
You need to say the word.

39:06.863 --> 39:07.531
Yes.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.749
That's enough for now.

39:12.875 --> 39:14.378
Thank you, Robin.

39:14.503 --> 39:16.674
I know this wasn't easy for you,
and I appreciate you doing it.

39:16.799 --> 39:17.300
[knocking on door]

39:17.425 --> 39:17.676
MAVIS: Sheriff?

39:20.640 --> 39:22.644
Ah.

39:22.727 --> 39:26.026
Hey, reach out to Russell
Stafford at the Justice

39:26.193 --> 39:26.987
Department.

39:27.112 --> 39:28.406
He owes me a favor.

39:28.573 --> 39:32.372
Ask about a government agency
called The Organization.

39:32.539 --> 39:34.543
And send Mrs. Johnson in here.

39:34.668 --> 39:35.086
All right?

39:41.056 --> 39:44.313
[ominous music]

39:46.400 --> 39:47.611
Your mother's here, Robin.

39:51.243 --> 39:53.874
CELESTE: You OK, baby?

39:54.041 --> 39:56.503
So, you gonna arrest
the son of a bitch?

39:56.629 --> 40:00.553
Well, right now, we have zero
proof that Sam Turner committed

40:00.678 --> 40:04.394
a crime, which means we have
no grounds to arrest him.

40:04.519 --> 40:06.231
You've got to be kidding me.

40:06.398 --> 40:08.277
Did you not hear what my
daughter just told you?

40:08.444 --> 40:10.198
You just took a
polygraph, for god's sake!

40:10.323 --> 40:14.665
We have no physical evidence
that Mr. Turner committed

40:14.831 --> 40:15.918
a crime.

40:16.251 --> 40:20.928
It's Robin's word against
his, and Mr. Turner,

40:21.095 --> 40:23.099
he passed his polygraph.

40:23.265 --> 40:24.643
But he‐‐ he‐‐

40:24.810 --> 40:27.565
he killed Javier on purpose.

40:27.691 --> 40:28.150
Robin.

40:31.240 --> 40:35.248
You suffered a tremendous shock.

40:35.331 --> 40:36.625
And maybe because
of it, your memory

40:36.792 --> 40:39.172
is playing tricks on you.

40:39.297 --> 40:43.013
But what I told
you was the truth.

40:43.180 --> 40:47.564
Hey, baby, will you go
get me a cup of coffee?

40:47.689 --> 40:49.609
I want to talk to the
sheriff for a minute.

40:56.665 --> 40:58.794
Look, Mrs. Johnson,
there's something else

40:58.920 --> 41:00.089
I need to talk to you about.

41:00.214 --> 41:02.093
CELESTE: I believe my daughter.

41:02.218 --> 41:06.351
If she says this is what
happened, it happened.

41:06.477 --> 41:09.984
I believe Robin believes
it's what happened,

41:10.151 --> 41:14.367
and the human brain is real
good at playing tricks on us.

41:14.493 --> 41:19.127
It comes up with ways
to avoid painful truths

41:19.252 --> 41:21.298
and makes up all
kinds of stories

41:21.507 --> 41:23.970
to help us cope
with our guilt. It

41:24.137 --> 41:28.562
can make us believe things
that just aren't true.

41:28.687 --> 41:32.195
Right now, I strongly
suggest that you

41:32.362 --> 41:36.245
get Robin some counseling.

41:36.370 --> 41:38.499
Explain the missing days.

41:38.624 --> 41:40.002
What were they
doing all that time?

41:40.169 --> 41:43.885
Makes no sense, unless you
know that man is a murderer

41:44.010 --> 41:46.557
and he was holding my
daughter against her will.

41:46.682 --> 41:48.644
We won't know
anything for sure

41:48.769 --> 41:52.277
until we get the autopsy
report for time of death.

41:52.443 --> 41:55.741
Mrs. Johnson, I am
looking into this,

41:55.868 --> 41:58.372
but the best thing
you can do for Robin

41:58.539 --> 42:00.001
is to get her some help.

42:00.167 --> 42:02.463
Oh, I can't believe
that you believe

42:02.630 --> 42:05.136
the word of some stranger
who wanders around

42:05.303 --> 42:06.848
in the woods over my daughter!

42:07.015 --> 42:09.019
Robin failed her polygraph.

42:20.082 --> 42:20.666
Yeah.

43:00.287 --> 43:00.872
Robin?

43:09.389 --> 43:10.433
Robin, what's going on?

43:10.599 --> 43:11.518
Do you see that?

43:11.685 --> 43:12.520
I think they're following us.

43:12.645 --> 43:13.522
Keep driving, Mom, please.

43:13.647 --> 43:15.192
Don't‐‐ don't‐‐ don't stop.

43:15.317 --> 43:15.944
I‐‐

43:19.617 --> 43:20.912
Oh, it's The Organization.

43:21.038 --> 43:24.002
They‐‐ they found me, just
like Sam said they would.

43:24.127 --> 43:26.381
CELESTE: Robin, what
are you talking about?

43:26.506 --> 43:27.341
ROBIN: They know where we live.

43:27.467 --> 43:28.552
They're going to kill me!

43:28.677 --> 43:29.429
CELESTE: No one's
going to kill you.

43:29.554 --> 43:30.181
ROBIN: You weren't there!

43:30.347 --> 43:31.058
You don't know!

43:31.141 --> 43:31.433
Mom, please!

43:31.600 --> 43:32.310
Don't stop!

43:32.477 --> 43:33.520
Don't pull in!

43:33.645 --> 43:34.189
They're right behind
us, Mom, please!

43:34.355 --> 43:35.316
CELESTE: Baby!

43:35.483 --> 43:36.401
ROBIN: Please don't, Mom!

43:36.526 --> 43:37.695
Please!

43:37.820 --> 43:40.284
CELESTE: You're not
making any sense.

43:40.451 --> 43:43.791
Calm down, Robin.

43:43.875 --> 43:45.044
Mom, get back in the car!

43:45.169 --> 43:48.550
Robin, what is
happening with you?

43:48.675 --> 43:51.181
That's just Mrs. Daniels, Robin.

43:51.348 --> 43:52.725
Hi!

43:52.851 --> 43:55.272
MRS. DANIELS: Hello,
Celeste, Robin!

43:55.356 --> 43:57.986
Hello, Mrs. Daniels.

44:03.205 --> 44:08.090
I‐‐ I thought I thought
they were following us.

44:08.215 --> 44:09.969
Oh, baby!

44:12.515 --> 44:13.809
It is what happened, OK?

44:13.935 --> 44:16.690
Just‐‐ parts that
I can remember‐‐

44:16.815 --> 44:17.525
Of course it is.

44:17.692 --> 44:18.987
I believe you.

44:19.195 --> 44:21.283
I don't care what that stupid
lie detector test said.

44:24.038 --> 44:26.501
Do you think I'm
losing my mind?

44:26.668 --> 44:28.672
Of course not.

44:28.839 --> 44:32.096
Whatever happened
out in those woods,

44:32.221 --> 44:34.309
that man is never going
to touch you again.

44:34.475 --> 44:35.937
Do you hear me?

44:36.104 --> 44:39.694
Over my dead body is anyone
ever going to hurt you again.

44:39.819 --> 44:42.408
Now come on.

44:42.533 --> 44:47.961
And I am going to be right
here if you need anything.

44:48.086 --> 44:49.005
DONNY (ON THE
PHONE): Sheriff, this

44:49.130 --> 44:50.633
is Donny from the state police.

44:50.716 --> 44:52.178
Check your inbox.

44:52.303 --> 44:54.349
Just sent you some information
on that Sam Turner fellow.

44:58.523 --> 45:00.819
I'll be.

45:00.946 --> 45:02.866
Look at that record.

45:05.120 --> 45:09.837
Looks like Sam Turner isn't
such a nice guy after all.

45:10.005 --> 45:12.009
ROBIN: Feels like
half of my heart's

45:12.093 --> 45:15.474
been ripped out of me, Mom.

45:15.599 --> 45:21.111
CELESTE: When your dad passed,
I didn't know what to do.

45:21.278 --> 45:26.288
I couldn't accept that
this was the new normal.

45:26.413 --> 45:31.381
It was like a world that used
to be in color went all gray.

45:31.506 --> 45:33.970
And after a while, you
forget what color even is.

45:34.095 --> 45:37.226
You're just living in that
dark place all the time.

45:37.351 --> 45:40.816
One day, I heard his
voice in my head,

45:40.984 --> 45:46.036
and, ha, it was
not a happy sound.

45:46.202 --> 45:50.879
He said, Celeste,
I love you, girl,

45:51.004 --> 45:53.926
but you're screwing this up.

45:54.093 --> 45:56.097
That sounds like Dad.

45:56.264 --> 45:59.270
He said I needed to stop
feeling sorry for myself,

45:59.437 --> 46:02.443
that the cancer might have
gotten him, but he wasn't gone,

46:02.610 --> 46:07.996
and he wasn't going to watch me
be a sad sack for the next 40

46:08.121 --> 46:09.457
years.

46:09.582 --> 46:11.628
Really?

46:11.753 --> 46:13.298
Hand to god.

46:13.465 --> 46:17.765
And I know Javy doesn't
want to watch you give up

46:17.933 --> 46:19.685
on your life, baby.

46:19.811 --> 46:21.941
It's different.

46:22.066 --> 46:26.449
Dad was sick, and Javy was shot.

46:26.616 --> 46:31.126
Sam Turner's walking around,
and my husband's dead.

46:31.292 --> 46:34.842
How can I live my life
when he stole Javier's?

46:35.008 --> 46:37.096
You just do it, baby.

46:37.221 --> 46:40.394
Because if you don't,
then that man wins.

46:40.519 --> 46:44.777
Instead of taking one
life, he'll have taken two.

46:44.903 --> 46:45.821
I don't want him to win.

46:45.989 --> 46:47.825
Then don't let him.

46:47.993 --> 46:50.789
I need to see
Javier's parents.

46:50.915 --> 46:51.959
Tell them what happened.

46:52.084 --> 46:54.797
They'll believe me.

46:54.965 --> 46:56.217
They've been through a lot.

46:56.342 --> 46:58.013
I'm not sure telling them
all the things you think

46:58.180 --> 47:00.058
happened is a good idea.

47:00.184 --> 47:02.271
But they deserve to know.

47:02.438 --> 47:04.358
Well, they're grieving, baby.

47:08.910 --> 47:10.287
You don't believe me.

47:10.412 --> 47:12.750
You say you do, but you don't.

47:12.918 --> 47:14.587
That's not true.

47:14.712 --> 47:15.380
Then call them.

47:20.098 --> 47:23.396
[knocking on door]

47:25.484 --> 47:27.488
I'm not sure this
is such a good idea.

47:34.835 --> 47:35.671
Emi, please.

47:35.754 --> 47:36.589
Please be nice.

47:36.714 --> 47:37.884
Not a good idea?

47:38.218 --> 47:42.059
My son, mi corazon, is dead,
and your daughter was there.

47:42.184 --> 47:43.854
I want to see her.

47:44.021 --> 47:45.607
Please, don't do this.

47:45.732 --> 47:46.986
Don't do what?

47:47.278 --> 47:48.990
Demand to know the truth of
what happened to our son?

47:49.115 --> 47:50.701
The sheriff says
it was an accident,

47:50.784 --> 47:52.998
but Robin says it was murder.

47:53.164 --> 47:54.584
I need to see my
daughter‐in‐law.

47:54.750 --> 47:56.629
OK.

47:56.754 --> 47:57.464
She's upstairs.

48:03.518 --> 48:06.608
Honey, Ana and
Emiliano are here.

48:12.453 --> 48:13.288
Papa Rivera?

48:21.262 --> 48:23.808
You gave her this?

48:23.934 --> 48:26.064
Javier asked to have it.

48:26.230 --> 48:28.234
It was for Robin.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.614
For their anniversary.

48:30.781 --> 48:33.078
I didn't‐‐

48:33.203 --> 48:41.177
I mean‐‐ here, you
should have it.

48:41.260 --> 48:42.680
No, this was a mistake.

48:42.763 --> 48:45.227
We should go.

48:45.352 --> 48:49.903
Tell me how my son died.

48:50.070 --> 48:52.157
The truth.

48:52.282 --> 48:54.955
He was‐‐ he was murdered.

49:01.801 --> 49:03.513
How?

49:03.680 --> 49:07.981
I thought it was an
accident, and I don't know why.

49:08.148 --> 49:12.030
I just‐‐ I don't remember.

49:12.156 --> 49:12.991
But he was shot.

49:18.835 --> 49:24.305
This‐‐ this is your fault.

49:24.472 --> 49:34.450
It's all my fault.
All my fault. Ana.

49:37.164 --> 49:38.708
No, no, no, no, no, no.

49:38.876 --> 49:39.376
Please.

49:56.995 --> 50:00.293
EMILIANO: Javier was born after
we were told Ana would have

50:00.418 --> 50:02.631
no more children.

50:02.714 --> 50:06.806
My son, I know you
are with your maker.

50:06.974 --> 50:10.940
You were the best of
us, the best of me.

50:33.610 --> 50:38.954
Robin, Celeste, I took
a look at Sam's record.

50:39.079 --> 50:39.830
He's a bad guy.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.127
He is a convicted
felon and a liar,

50:42.252 --> 50:45.050
and yesterday, my contact
at the Justice Department

50:45.216 --> 50:49.350
confirmed that there is no
secret government entity called

50:49.475 --> 50:51.145
The Organization.

50:51.312 --> 50:53.024
I am not surprised.

50:53.107 --> 50:57.574
Look, I don't care what
the lie detector says.

50:57.741 --> 51:00.538
I believe that Sam
murdered Javier.

51:03.169 --> 51:05.215
OK.

51:05.382 --> 51:06.717
I need to see him locked up.

51:06.843 --> 51:07.929
Good.

51:08.179 --> 51:09.765
I want that, too, but I'm
going to need your help.

51:09.933 --> 51:12.062
Now, there's somebody that
I want you to talk to.

51:12.229 --> 51:16.612
He's agreed, as a favor to me,
to speak with you at no charge.

51:26.087 --> 51:29.093
DR. DEVLIN: I want you
to clear your mind.

51:29.261 --> 51:34.187
Now, imagine you're in an
elevator on the 10th floor.

51:34.313 --> 51:37.861
And with each floor you pass
on your way to the bottom,

51:38.028 --> 51:41.994
you'll find yourself getting
more and more relaxed.

51:42.162 --> 51:47.172
Feel the elevator vibrating
as it starts its descent.

51:47.297 --> 51:53.559
Look, there's the ninth
floor, and the eighth floor,

51:53.726 --> 51:56.398
and finally, the first floor.

51:56.565 --> 51:59.028
The door is open.

51:59.196 --> 52:04.664
You're in a safe place,
where no one can hurt you.

52:04.831 --> 52:06.000
Do you understand?

52:08.672 --> 52:14.393
Now, let's go back to the
day your husband Javier died.

52:14.518 --> 52:15.770
Tell me what you saw.

52:15.895 --> 52:16.855
SAM: Robin, you saw it.

52:16.939 --> 52:17.690
I just handed him the gun‐‐

52:17.816 --> 52:18.692
[robin sobbing]

52:18.859 --> 52:21.573
I saw Javier get shot.

52:21.782 --> 52:30.842
I‐‐ Wait, wait,
that's not right.

52:30.967 --> 52:32.470
I was too far behind.

52:32.637 --> 52:34.182
I didn't see Sam shoot Javy.

52:37.522 --> 52:40.445
Take your clothes off.

52:40.611 --> 52:41.321
What is it, Robin?

52:44.828 --> 52:46.080
What are you remembering?

52:50.046 --> 52:52.092
ROBIN: I saw other
people, but he

52:52.177 --> 52:54.806
made it impossible to get away.

52:54.931 --> 52:58.397
I'm a trained marksman
for The Organization.

52:58.564 --> 53:01.445
I could shoot those hikers
right where they're standing.

53:01.570 --> 53:06.037
I've killed a lot of people,
a couple more won't matter.

53:06.163 --> 53:07.749
DR. DEVLIN: Go on, Robin.

53:07.874 --> 53:10.963
Tell me what you remember.

53:11.047 --> 53:15.473
You know, I'm a crack shot.

53:15.598 --> 53:20.775
So I would think really
hard before trying to run.

53:20.900 --> 53:23.531
We were never lost, were we?

53:26.787 --> 53:28.999
That first night, or even now.

53:29.124 --> 53:30.586
You knew exactly where we were.

53:34.469 --> 53:37.015
Everything that you
said has been a lie.

53:39.854 --> 53:41.275
Go clean that
blood off yourself.

53:56.012 --> 53:59.853
[ominous music]

54:00.061 --> 54:03.611
[sam breathing heavily]

54:12.085 --> 54:12.628
Come here.

54:17.011 --> 54:20.226
No.

54:20.393 --> 54:21.896
Take your clothes off.

54:22.021 --> 54:25.236
(CRYING) Please
don't make me do this.

54:25.403 --> 54:26.155
Take your clothes off.

54:34.296 --> 54:34.881
Yeah.

54:59.554 --> 55:00.097
Ah.

55:18.300 --> 55:21.766
Baby, I'm so‐‐

55:21.933 --> 55:23.895
I'm so glad you're here with me.

55:27.820 --> 55:29.155
That you want to
be here with me.

55:48.319 --> 55:52.327
ROBIN: That was‐‐ that was
the first time he raped me.

55:52.493 --> 55:53.078
DR. DEVLIN: Go on.

55:53.203 --> 55:53.705
It's safe here.

55:53.872 --> 55:55.792
No one can hurt you.

55:55.917 --> 55:59.257
He took me to the
middle of nowhere.

55:59.341 --> 56:02.848
It was filthy, with
garbage everywhere.

56:02.973 --> 56:07.858
(CRYING) He made me
do horrible things.

56:07.983 --> 56:11.073
Things that I've never
done with Javier.

56:11.198 --> 56:18.504
And he made me do it over, and
over, and over again, for days.

56:18.713 --> 56:20.717
He wanted me.

56:20.842 --> 56:24.265
That's why Javier
died, because of me.

56:24.349 --> 56:27.731
He wanted to leave,
but I made him stay.

56:27.898 --> 56:30.569
How could I let him
do those things to me?

56:30.737 --> 56:34.285
This was not
your fault, Robin.

56:34.452 --> 56:38.878
You didn't do anything
to make this happen.

56:39.003 --> 56:41.216
There are evil
people in the world.

56:41.383 --> 56:44.305
You just had the misfortune
of meeting one of them.

56:51.194 --> 56:53.950
Javier, I just had
the strangest dream.

57:03.636 --> 57:06.057
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

57:06.183 --> 57:12.988
We're, uh, all alone in
these big, dark woods.

57:13.113 --> 57:18.248
Me and you, miles and miles.

57:18.373 --> 57:20.252
Me and you, alone in
the woods forever.

57:22.799 --> 57:28.853
And if you ran into those woods,
they'll just gobble you up.

57:28.937 --> 57:33.738
"He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures."

57:33.905 --> 57:36.326
I used to be religious myself.

57:36.451 --> 57:38.580
But god gave up on
me a long time ago.

57:41.002 --> 57:42.463
I don't think that's true.

57:42.588 --> 57:46.889
I've killed too many people
for god to look kindly on me.

57:46.973 --> 57:50.855
Killing people is all
I was trained to do.

57:51.022 --> 57:53.485
You can still change.

57:53.653 --> 57:55.531
There's always time.

57:55.699 --> 57:58.495
Why are you crying?

57:58.663 --> 57:59.330
I miss my husband.

58:03.088 --> 58:06.011
I don't wanna hear about that.

58:06.136 --> 58:08.223
You should be getting
over that by now.

58:11.313 --> 58:18.327
You know, there are little
doors in the human mind.

58:18.493 --> 58:23.587
And you can open them and
close them whenever you want.

58:23.755 --> 58:28.597
One day, all the doors are
going to open in my mind,

58:28.723 --> 58:29.515
and I'm going to go crazy.

58:32.313 --> 58:36.071
I really hope you're not
there when it happens, Robin.

58:36.237 --> 58:37.531
You're such a sweet girl.

58:41.957 --> 58:43.753
Come here.

58:43.878 --> 58:45.130
You're shivering.

58:54.357 --> 58:57.196
I was trapped in the
woods with a mad men.

59:04.016 --> 59:08.024
DR. DEVLIN: It's a classic
case of brainwashing.

59:08.232 --> 59:09.026
Brainwashing?

59:09.151 --> 59:11.072
As in, what?

59:11.238 --> 59:12.115
KGB?

59:12.240 --> 59:13.201
Chinese military?

59:13.368 --> 59:14.703
Secret ops?

59:14.828 --> 59:16.540
DR. DEVLIN: No, actually,
I think I misspoke.

59:16.707 --> 59:23.554
The term, Stockholm Syndrome, is
more appropriate in this case.

59:23.680 --> 59:26.644
For her own survival,
Robin Rivera

59:26.769 --> 59:30.443
began to identify with
her husband's killer

59:30.610 --> 59:33.658
to the point where she
was so in his thrall

59:33.783 --> 59:37.457
that he was able to implant
false memories in her brain.

59:37.624 --> 59:40.213
Which is why she
failed the lie detector.

59:40.338 --> 59:42.509
I should have put that together.

59:42.634 --> 59:44.847
Well, at the time, you
couldn't understand the extent

59:44.973 --> 59:45.515
of his reach.

59:48.271 --> 59:51.903
Once they got to
the campsite, Robin,

59:52.070 --> 59:55.911
having been emotionally,
physically, and sexually

59:56.120 --> 1:00:00.378
abused by her captor, was
totally open to any suggestion

1:00:00.462 --> 1:00:02.967
Sam Turner put in her brain.

1:00:03.134 --> 1:00:05.764
Especially because she
couldn't bear the reality

1:00:05.931 --> 1:00:10.983
that Sam killed Javier
in order to possess her.

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:18.414
And then, finally, he offered
her the promise of a reward.

1:00:18.581 --> 1:00:21.295
And what kind of
reward would that be?

1:00:21.462 --> 1:00:24.301
The most basic
reward there is.

1:00:24.468 --> 1:00:25.136
Her life.

1:00:27.850 --> 1:00:29.979
Ugh.

1:00:30.105 --> 1:00:35.950
So I have a witness who heard
her husband being shot to death

1:00:36.075 --> 1:00:39.123
but who was brainwashed
somehow by the murderer

1:00:39.289 --> 1:00:42.546
into saying it was an accident.

1:00:42.671 --> 1:00:44.716
I got bupkis so
far on forensics,

1:00:44.842 --> 1:00:46.637
although the state crime
lab is taking a look

1:00:46.762 --> 1:00:49.601
at the gun and some tissue
samples from Javier.

1:00:49.768 --> 1:00:52.816
And to top it all
off, my suspect

1:00:52.984 --> 1:00:57.075
is a drifter with no known
address who's out in the wind.

1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:59.288
Sounds like you've got
your work cut out for you.

1:00:59.413 --> 1:01:01.500
Yes, I do.

1:01:01.584 --> 1:01:02.920
But we got the
truth on our side,

1:01:03.045 --> 1:01:05.885
and that's always
worth fighting for.

1:01:06.051 --> 1:01:08.055
I just got to find
a way to prove it.

1:01:08.222 --> 1:01:13.065
But I think if Robin
is willing to testify,

1:01:13.191 --> 1:01:14.026
we're off to the races.

1:01:18.075 --> 1:01:21.832
And now, I have the harder
job of calling Celeste Johnson

1:01:21.958 --> 1:01:25.423
and telling her what really
happened to her daughter.

1:01:25.548 --> 1:01:27.719
It's what Robin wanted.

1:01:27.844 --> 1:01:30.350
I don't think she can face
talking with her mother

1:01:30.516 --> 1:01:31.352
quite yet.

1:01:38.658 --> 1:01:41.372
CELESTE: Yes.

1:01:41.580 --> 1:01:44.921
Yes, I‐‐ I understand.

1:01:45.088 --> 1:01:48.052
I'll give her some space and
let her come to me when she's

1:01:48.177 --> 1:01:48.761
ready.

1:02:32.557 --> 1:02:35.188
If she wants to testify, I'll‐‐

1:02:35.313 --> 1:02:38.319
I'll support her.

1:02:38.444 --> 1:02:41.241
[phone ringing]

1:02:44.623 --> 1:02:45.833
Hey.

1:02:45.959 --> 1:02:47.880
I heard you folks
were looking for me.

1:02:48.047 --> 1:02:50.426
Ma'am, this is my
lawyer, Ed Hargrove.

1:02:50.551 --> 1:02:52.013
I'm sure you've heard of him.

1:02:52.138 --> 1:02:54.142
My client and I would like
a word with Sheriff Watkins,

1:02:54.309 --> 1:02:54.852
please.

1:02:58.234 --> 1:03:02.910
MAVIS: Sheriff, Sam Turner and
his lawyer are here to see you.

1:03:03.077 --> 1:03:05.498
SHERIFF WATKINS: He wants
to talk, let's talk.

1:03:05.623 --> 1:03:06.625
Follow me.

1:03:06.750 --> 1:03:07.836
ED HARGROVE: Interrogation room?

1:03:08.003 --> 1:03:08.712
Really?

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:10.341
What are we doing in here?

1:03:10.466 --> 1:03:12.095
SHERIFF WATKINS: Oh, I thought
we'd have more privacy in here.

1:03:12.220 --> 1:03:14.307
I can leave the door open
if it makes you feel better.

1:03:21.321 --> 1:03:25.037
Now, it's come to
my client's attention

1:03:25.163 --> 1:03:26.748
that Robin Rivera
is slandering him

1:03:26.875 --> 1:03:28.335
in the court of public opinion.

1:03:28.502 --> 1:03:29.964
I don't think that's so.

1:03:30.047 --> 1:03:31.926
Has she not been telling
people that my client kidnapped

1:03:32.051 --> 1:03:34.306
her, held her hostage,
murdered her husband?

1:03:34.431 --> 1:03:38.564
If that's not slander,
then what do you call it?

1:03:38.689 --> 1:03:41.946
Listen, my friends in town are
telling me people are talking.

1:03:42.113 --> 1:03:43.491
Just like I said
to Mr. Hargrove,

1:03:43.616 --> 1:03:46.998
I just want to clear this up
before things get out of hand.

1:03:47.165 --> 1:03:49.753
I don't know what
Robin's playing at,

1:03:49.879 --> 1:03:52.008
but she saw the whole thing.

1:03:52.175 --> 1:03:54.387
She knows it's an accident.

1:03:54.554 --> 1:03:59.356
Sheriff Watkins, are you aware
that my client and Mrs. Rivera

1:03:59.523 --> 1:04:02.153
had sexual relations?

1:04:02.278 --> 1:04:05.076
Look, I believe she regrets
what happened and has concocted

1:04:05.201 --> 1:04:07.664
this whole story so that she
looks like the victim instead

1:04:07.830 --> 1:04:08.959
of a liar.

1:04:09.125 --> 1:04:11.171
If you're saying
that Robin had comfort

1:04:11.338 --> 1:04:16.014
sex with your client hours
after her husband was killed,

1:04:16.098 --> 1:04:18.143
well, that's just horseshit.

1:04:18.269 --> 1:04:20.648
How dare you walk in
here and speak this way

1:04:20.773 --> 1:04:25.867
about a young woman who your
client tortured and abused?

1:04:26.034 --> 1:04:28.539
Robin Rivera recanted her story.

1:04:28.706 --> 1:04:34.676
She says your client killed
her husband in cold blood.

1:04:34.801 --> 1:04:36.221
And I believe her.

1:04:40.229 --> 1:04:44.070
Sheriff Watkins,
please, listen to me.

1:04:47.744 --> 1:04:51.043
I did not murder Javier.

1:04:51.168 --> 1:04:53.797
Robin was upset, and she
ran off into the woods,

1:04:53.923 --> 1:04:55.635
and I went after her.

1:04:55.760 --> 1:04:57.639
We got lost.

1:04:57.805 --> 1:05:00.394
One thing led to another, and‐‐

1:05:00.478 --> 1:05:04.569
and things just
happened between us.

1:05:04.736 --> 1:05:07.825
So that's why you kept
her in the woods for days

1:05:07.951 --> 1:05:10.916
with her dead husband's body?

1:05:11.041 --> 1:05:14.339
I passed the lie
detector test, ma'am.

1:05:14.464 --> 1:05:16.593
What else am I supposed to
do to prove my innocence?

1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:20.267
And speaking of lie detector
tests, did I hear right?

1:05:20.434 --> 1:05:22.814
That your witness failed hers?

1:05:40.887 --> 1:05:44.686
Mom, no, I need
to do this alone.

1:06:14.955 --> 1:06:17.001
JAVIER: Leave it to
my wife to burn water.

1:06:17.167 --> 1:06:18.044
Who burns water?

1:06:39.003 --> 1:06:40.590
Hey, babe, can
you hand me those?

1:06:54.409 --> 1:06:57.247
[suspenseful music]

1:07:09.230 --> 1:07:10.525
Oh, my god.

1:07:10.650 --> 1:07:13.279
[knocking on door]

1:07:13.447 --> 1:07:14.866
Robin?

1:07:15.033 --> 1:07:16.285
I got worried.

1:07:16.453 --> 1:07:17.246
Everything OK?

1:07:30.773 --> 1:07:32.485
He was here.

1:07:32.569 --> 1:07:35.240
Sam was outside.

1:07:35.366 --> 1:07:36.743
Did you see him?

1:07:36.869 --> 1:07:37.327
No.

1:07:40.668 --> 1:07:41.920
We have to tell the sheriff.

1:07:45.010 --> 1:07:50.688
Do you‐‐ do you think
that I'm a bad person?

1:07:50.771 --> 1:07:51.982
A bad person?

1:07:52.107 --> 1:07:56.783
Oh, Robin, how could
I ever think that?

1:07:56.909 --> 1:07:58.119
You're a good person.

1:08:01.627 --> 1:08:05.927
He raped me, Mom, and
I couldn't stop him.

1:08:06.052 --> 1:08:09.141
I should have
tried to fight him.

1:08:09.266 --> 1:08:12.899
I should have tried to
run away, but I couldn't.

1:08:13.066 --> 1:08:15.863
I know.

1:08:15.947 --> 1:08:17.909
I know.

1:08:18.034 --> 1:08:20.038
I'm a terrible person.

1:08:20.205 --> 1:08:22.167
You are not a terrible person.

1:08:22.334 --> 1:08:25.591
You did nothing
wrong, do you hear me?

1:08:25.675 --> 1:08:29.432
If you'd fought him, he
would have killed you.

1:08:29.599 --> 1:08:36.112
When someone violates you like
that, it is never your fault.

1:08:36.195 --> 1:08:37.699
But I should have
done something.

1:08:37.865 --> 1:08:40.120
You did.

1:08:40.203 --> 1:08:41.122
You survived.

1:08:49.973 --> 1:08:52.437
I can't testify, Mom.

1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:55.818
I want to, for
Javier and for me,

1:08:55.985 --> 1:09:01.037
but I just can't
face him in court.

1:09:01.203 --> 1:09:03.291
But you told the sheriff.

1:09:03.417 --> 1:09:03.917
I know.

1:09:04.001 --> 1:09:06.339
But I just can't.

1:09:06.506 --> 1:09:07.925
I can't.

1:09:08.092 --> 1:09:10.765
He's dangerous, Mom.

1:09:10.848 --> 1:09:16.777
He'll kill me, and I'm
scared he'll kill you, too.

1:09:26.922 --> 1:09:28.216
Celeste called.

1:09:28.384 --> 1:09:31.390
She claims Robin saw
Sam at her apartment.

1:09:31.515 --> 1:09:33.184
Well, did Celeste see him?

1:09:33.352 --> 1:09:36.148
No, but you're going
to want to see this.

1:09:36.315 --> 1:09:37.819
It's from the state crime lab.

1:09:50.886 --> 1:09:52.348
Celeste.

1:09:52.515 --> 1:09:55.855
[clears throat] We've got
the forensics and the autopsy

1:09:55.938 --> 1:09:57.525
back on Javier.

1:09:57.734 --> 1:10:00.531
Sam Turner is a liar,
and we can prove it.

1:10:00.698 --> 1:10:03.537
There were no powder
burns on the victim,

1:10:03.620 --> 1:10:07.837
so there was no way in heck that
he was standing next to Javier

1:10:07.962 --> 1:10:10.593
handing him the rifle
when it discharged.

1:10:13.390 --> 1:10:15.394
We're issuing a warrant, and
we're going to arrest him.

1:10:15.519 --> 1:10:18.149
And with this new evidence
and Robin's testimony,

1:10:18.316 --> 1:10:20.488
we're going to put him
away on the murder charge.

1:10:24.621 --> 1:10:26.332
Wait.

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:30.382
What do you mean Robin's
decided not to testify?

1:10:34.474 --> 1:10:37.647
[upbeat music playing faintly]

1:10:42.072 --> 1:10:43.032
Oh, my god.

1:10:46.832 --> 1:10:48.502
Oh, come on.

1:10:48.669 --> 1:10:51.716
You've always liked
a nice picnic.

1:10:51.842 --> 1:10:55.975
I got you all your favorites,
including marshmallows.

1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:02.780
So have you given any more
thought to what you want to do?

1:11:02.905 --> 1:11:04.157
I don't know.

1:11:04.283 --> 1:11:10.462
Robin, it's been three months,
and no sign of Sam Turner.

1:11:10.629 --> 1:11:12.340
You don't understand.

1:11:12.466 --> 1:11:14.554
How can they not
find him by now?

1:11:14.679 --> 1:11:19.355
He could be in Timbuktu
for all I know by now.

1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:20.816
School semester
is starting soon,

1:11:20.941 --> 1:11:23.947
and I bet if you called Mike
at the convenience store,

1:11:24.156 --> 1:11:25.576
he'd give you your old job back.

1:11:25.659 --> 1:11:26.661
Mom.

1:11:26.828 --> 1:11:27.329
Please.

1:11:27.455 --> 1:11:28.874
Something's got to give.

1:11:28.999 --> 1:11:31.170
You are young, and you have
your whole life ahead of you.

1:11:31.295 --> 1:11:34.301
You can't just hide.

1:11:34.427 --> 1:11:36.640
Well, actually,
I've been thinking,

1:11:36.765 --> 1:11:38.936
and I can't really
afford my apartment,

1:11:39.019 --> 1:11:42.818
so I thought it'd be
good for me to stay here

1:11:42.985 --> 1:11:44.071
with you for a while.

1:11:44.196 --> 1:11:45.491
Oh!

1:11:45.658 --> 1:11:47.453
And I already talked
to Mike at Thrifty Mart.

1:11:47.620 --> 1:11:50.249
He's getting me an
afternoon shift tomorrow.

1:11:50.333 --> 1:11:51.251
Oh!

1:11:51.419 --> 1:11:53.548
That's wonderful!

1:11:53.674 --> 1:11:56.261
Now, about school.

1:11:56.346 --> 1:11:57.305
All right, all right.

1:11:57.431 --> 1:11:58.850
I'll get a catalog of courses.

1:12:01.523 --> 1:12:03.735
I happen to have
a copy right here.

1:12:03.902 --> 1:12:04.779
You're the worst.

1:12:04.862 --> 1:12:06.031
Yeah, I know.

1:12:06.198 --> 1:12:07.158
That's why you love me.

1:12:11.376 --> 1:12:13.880
[robin chuckles]

1:12:14.047 --> 1:12:15.592
What's so funny?

1:12:15.718 --> 1:12:17.680
I could have
opened to any page,

1:12:17.847 --> 1:12:23.024
but this is the course Javier
wanted me to sign up for.

1:12:23.190 --> 1:12:23.734
Nursing?

1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:27.700
You're going to
make a great nurse.

1:12:43.482 --> 1:12:45.318
SAM: Oh, finally alone together.

1:12:47.907 --> 1:12:48.408
No.

1:12:48.575 --> 1:12:51.080
Hey, I'm your friend.

1:12:51.205 --> 1:12:52.666
I'm here to help.

1:12:52.792 --> 1:12:55.714
You know, if we want, we can
just make this all go away.

1:12:55.881 --> 1:12:56.841
No.

1:12:56.925 --> 1:12:58.094
You did those things to me.

1:12:58.219 --> 1:12:59.430
I remember.

1:12:59.597 --> 1:13:03.062
No, I didn't do
anything to you.

1:13:03.187 --> 1:13:04.231
I saved your life.

1:13:04.357 --> 1:13:05.859
You killed Javy.

1:13:06.026 --> 1:13:07.780
Oh, that.

1:13:07.905 --> 1:13:09.909
That was an accident.

1:13:10.076 --> 1:13:11.704
You saw it.

1:13:11.913 --> 1:13:15.086
I handed him the
gun, and it went off.

1:13:15.253 --> 1:13:16.213
No!

1:13:16.381 --> 1:13:18.050
SAM: Yes.

1:13:18.175 --> 1:13:21.140
And you raped me.

1:13:21.306 --> 1:13:23.562
No, I didn't.

1:13:23.687 --> 1:13:28.989
You were upset, and I
tried to comfort you.

1:13:29.156 --> 1:13:34.082
And things happened between us,
because we have a connection.

1:13:34.249 --> 1:13:34.834
Do you hear me?

1:13:34.959 --> 1:13:37.297
We have a connection!

1:13:37.464 --> 1:13:39.468
You're lying.

1:13:39.594 --> 1:13:41.180
You sure about that, Robin?

1:13:41.305 --> 1:13:44.979
I mean, I'm the one that
passed the lie detector test.

1:13:45.104 --> 1:13:45.522
Help!

1:13:45.606 --> 1:13:46.190
Help!

1:13:46.273 --> 1:13:48.987
[sam laughs]

1:13:50.991 --> 1:13:53.413
[sighs]

1:13:53.622 --> 1:13:54.582
SHERIFF WATKINS:
Bastard's stalking her.

1:13:54.707 --> 1:13:58.255
We got to get Robin
to a safe place.

1:13:58.465 --> 1:14:00.344
How could we have missed him?

1:14:00.510 --> 1:14:03.265
He's been here the whole time.

1:14:03.475 --> 1:14:05.186
What do you want to do, Chief?

1:14:05.354 --> 1:14:08.067
All right, we have
to protect Robin.

1:14:08.150 --> 1:14:08.818
Come on.

1:14:11.991 --> 1:14:13.620
ROBIN: Why can't I
just stay at the house?

1:14:13.828 --> 1:14:15.499
CELESTE: No one knows
we're here, Robin.

1:14:15.666 --> 1:14:17.126
The chief said it
would be safer.

1:14:17.252 --> 1:14:19.130
[knocking on door]

1:14:19.214 --> 1:14:20.341
SHERIFF WATKINS: It's not right.

1:14:20.467 --> 1:14:23.055
We can't let him intimidate her.

1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:26.228
I'm going to have deputies
watching this room 24/7.

1:14:26.311 --> 1:14:28.650
He is not going to
get anywhere near you.

1:14:28.817 --> 1:14:30.862
CELESTE: How long will
we have to stay here?

1:14:30.988 --> 1:14:33.451
At least until we
nail the son of a bitch.

1:14:33.660 --> 1:14:35.372
And if he goes to
trial and is acquitted?

1:14:35.497 --> 1:14:38.335
SHERIFF WATKINS: Well,
we'll cross that bridge

1:14:38.503 --> 1:14:39.964
if we come to it.

1:14:40.172 --> 1:14:43.555
Look, I am absolutely
convinced that Sam Turner is

1:14:43.722 --> 1:14:45.266
a merciless killer,
but we're going

1:14:45.434 --> 1:14:48.314
to just have to hope that the
state sees that he's guilty,

1:14:48.481 --> 1:14:49.358
too.

1:14:49.483 --> 1:14:50.652
Of course he is guilty.

1:14:50.861 --> 1:14:55.620
I'm just‐‐ I'm so tired of
everyone questioning it.

1:14:55.746 --> 1:14:57.081
It's the truth.

1:14:57.206 --> 1:14:59.754
This isn't about the truth.

1:14:59.879 --> 1:15:02.634
It's about what a
judge and jury believe.

1:15:02.718 --> 1:15:04.347
And without you‐‐

1:15:04.513 --> 1:15:07.018
Testifying?

1:15:07.185 --> 1:15:07.519
No.

1:15:07.644 --> 1:15:09.064
I can't do that.

1:15:09.189 --> 1:15:12.320
He'll kill me, he'll
kill my mom, and‐‐

1:15:12.529 --> 1:15:18.541
then he'll just be out there,
in his filthy shed by the river.

1:15:18.666 --> 1:15:20.294
SHERIFF WATKINS: Filthy shed?

1:15:20.420 --> 1:15:22.466
OK, wait a minute,
I got a hunch.

1:15:22.591 --> 1:15:24.512
Call Fish and Game about
decommissioned depots

1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:25.639
by the river.

1:15:25.806 --> 1:15:29.563
The two you just sit tight, OK?

1:15:29.730 --> 1:15:30.690
We need to go search the woods.

1:15:30.816 --> 1:15:32.694
Crack of dawn,
we're on the hunt.

1:15:32.778 --> 1:15:33.530
SAM: I'm freezing.

1:15:36.411 --> 1:15:37.621
Do I feel hot?

1:15:41.546 --> 1:15:42.589
Oh, you're burning up.

1:15:42.756 --> 1:15:44.385
Oh, I'm sick.

1:15:44.468 --> 1:15:46.722
I'm sick, aren't I?

1:15:46.806 --> 1:15:48.142
I'm gonna die.

1:15:48.308 --> 1:15:50.229
Oh my god, I'm going to die.

1:15:50.397 --> 1:15:53.110
Not if we go to town and
get you some medical help.

1:15:53.277 --> 1:15:54.195
No!

1:15:54.530 --> 1:15:56.701
No, no, they'll lock me
up and throw away the key.

1:15:56.868 --> 1:15:59.457
No.

1:15:59.582 --> 1:16:02.629
We'll do what we can here.

1:16:02.796 --> 1:16:03.338
You're shivering.

1:16:03.465 --> 1:16:04.048
So‐‐

1:16:09.935 --> 1:16:13.776
You're such a
good person, Robin.

1:16:13.902 --> 1:16:17.826
You're too good for all this.

1:16:17.951 --> 1:16:20.957
You're a good man.

1:16:21.082 --> 1:16:23.421
You've taken care
of me, kept me safe.

1:16:23.546 --> 1:16:25.759
Yeah.

1:16:25.884 --> 1:16:28.640
That's true.

1:16:28.765 --> 1:16:30.184
You would've died without me.

1:16:33.148 --> 1:16:35.236
I would have died in
these woods without you.

1:16:42.250 --> 1:16:45.256
[screaming] I promise
you, I promise you!

1:16:45.465 --> 1:16:47.427
I don't remember it, but
killing Javier was an accident,

1:16:47.636 --> 1:16:49.264
I swear!

1:16:49.390 --> 1:16:51.686
You have to believe me.

1:16:51.811 --> 1:16:52.771
OK?

1:16:52.896 --> 1:16:54.692
I'm dying!

1:16:54.817 --> 1:16:55.902
OK?

1:16:55.986 --> 1:16:58.366
A dying man has
to tell the truth.

1:16:58.533 --> 1:16:59.410
Really?

1:16:59.493 --> 1:17:00.119
Yeah.

1:17:03.543 --> 1:17:07.174
When we get back, I'll tell
the sheriff the truth, that‐‐

1:17:07.341 --> 1:17:09.178
that it was an accident.

1:17:09.346 --> 1:17:11.601
That you didn't mean it.

1:17:11.726 --> 1:17:13.605
You'd do that for me?

1:17:13.771 --> 1:17:14.607
Of course.

1:17:14.773 --> 1:17:16.444
Like you said, it was‐‐

1:17:16.611 --> 1:17:18.113
An accident.

1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:20.452
It was a terrible,
terrible accident.

1:17:20.619 --> 1:17:22.204
ROBIN: An accident
no one could help.

1:17:22.372 --> 1:17:27.298
Because I know you would never
try to hurt me or Javier.

1:17:27.466 --> 1:17:29.845
No, never.

1:17:30.012 --> 1:17:31.807
You're my friend.

1:17:32.016 --> 1:17:34.521
You're‐‐ you like
me, and I like you.

1:17:37.861 --> 1:17:40.492
You saved my life.

1:17:40.617 --> 1:17:42.161
SAM: Robin, can
you say it again?

1:17:42.286 --> 1:17:43.623
I like hearing you say it.

1:17:43.706 --> 1:17:45.000
[coughs]

1:17:45.125 --> 1:17:47.881
It was an accident,
everything that happened

1:17:48.048 --> 1:17:49.843
to Javier getting killed.

1:17:50.010 --> 1:17:50.845
Gun just went off.

1:17:51.054 --> 1:17:52.808
It just went off.

1:17:52.974 --> 1:17:53.810
You were standing right there.

1:17:53.976 --> 1:17:55.020
You saw it all.

1:17:55.187 --> 1:17:58.444
I would never hurt
you or Javier.

1:17:58.528 --> 1:18:01.659
You heard the gunshot,
then you screamed.

1:18:01.742 --> 1:18:06.167
And then, Javier, but there was
nothing either of us could do.

1:18:06.292 --> 1:18:09.215
I screamed, I
heard thee gunshot.

1:18:09.340 --> 1:18:13.306
It was‐‐ it was a terrible,
terrible accident.

1:18:16.062 --> 1:18:17.231
Now we just have to
get back to the city

1:18:17.399 --> 1:18:20.195
and tell the sheriff
what you saw.

1:18:26.209 --> 1:18:29.007
Why am I such a coward?

1:18:29.174 --> 1:18:30.802
Javier would be ashamed of me.

1:18:30.927 --> 1:18:33.307
Being afraid doesn't
make you a coward.

1:18:35.562 --> 1:18:40.363
Robin, you have no control over
what happens in that courtroom.

1:18:40.530 --> 1:18:45.247
But if you decide to testify,
your only job is to go in there

1:18:45.373 --> 1:18:48.212
and tell the truth, your truth.

1:18:48.295 --> 1:18:50.132
That's all you have to do.

1:18:50.299 --> 1:18:51.928
Take your power back, baby.

1:18:58.273 --> 1:19:00.529
[music playing]

1:19:22.489 --> 1:19:25.077
SHERIFF WATKINS: Sam Turner!

1:19:25.202 --> 1:19:27.791
Stay away from the rifle.

1:19:27.916 --> 1:19:30.755
You're under arrest for the
murder of Javier Rivera.

1:19:36.141 --> 1:19:38.438
You know, I'm
going to sue you!

1:19:38.563 --> 1:19:42.905
For false arrest,
brutality, slander.

1:19:45.619 --> 1:19:49.125
My lawyer's going to
throw the book at you.

1:19:49.250 --> 1:19:52.799
You got nothin' on me, Sheriff.

1:19:52.966 --> 1:19:53.635
Turn around.

1:20:02.819 --> 1:20:05.533
You know, I'll be
out in a few weeks.

1:20:05.659 --> 1:20:07.161
You can't protect Robin forever.

1:20:13.340 --> 1:20:14.551
Come on.

1:20:17.724 --> 1:20:18.810
SHERIFF WATKINS: Look at this.

1:20:23.193 --> 1:20:24.405
All right, curtain it off!

1:20:24.530 --> 1:20:26.492
I want forensics up here now!

1:20:41.021 --> 1:20:43.316
Hi, baby.

1:20:43.401 --> 1:20:44.235
I miss you so much.

1:20:47.033 --> 1:20:52.544
I‐‐ I wish you were here so
I could talk to you for real.

1:20:52.711 --> 1:20:56.427
You always knew the
right thing to do.

1:20:56.552 --> 1:21:00.560
I want people to see that
Sam Turner is a liar.

1:21:00.727 --> 1:21:02.814
But I'm just so scared, Javy.

1:21:06.864 --> 1:21:10.622
He thought that I was
weak, that I was a victim,

1:21:10.789 --> 1:21:15.548
and he could do whatever
he wanted to me.

1:21:15.673 --> 1:21:18.429
But that was a mistake.

1:21:18.554 --> 1:21:20.350
I survived for a reason.

1:21:20.558 --> 1:21:24.023
For me, for you.

1:21:24.107 --> 1:21:25.944
And the life we never
got to have together.

1:21:30.202 --> 1:21:32.874
But I‐‐ I want to fight.

1:21:39.388 --> 1:21:40.013
I was wrong.

1:21:45.650 --> 1:21:49.908
You will always have a
place in my family, Robin.

1:21:50.075 --> 1:21:52.789
Forgive me.

1:21:52.956 --> 1:21:55.920
There's nothing to forgive.

1:21:56.129 --> 1:21:56.672
I loved Javier.

1:22:01.765 --> 1:22:04.270
I need to make sure
the man who hurt him‐‐

1:22:04.438 --> 1:22:05.022
pays.

1:22:25.396 --> 1:22:26.941
What's going on?

1:22:27.024 --> 1:22:29.320
I wanted to let you know I've
decided to testify at the trial

1:22:29.488 --> 1:22:30.113
today.

1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:31.032
[sam laughs]

1:22:31.157 --> 1:22:33.788
Hey, how are you
going to do that?

1:22:33.996 --> 1:22:37.545
Poor little Robin, you can't
get your story straight.

1:22:37.671 --> 1:22:39.633
ROBIN: That's
where you're wrong.

1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:41.512
I've got my story straight.

1:22:41.637 --> 1:22:43.306
And you know what?

1:22:43.474 --> 1:22:44.935
It was a happy ending.

1:22:45.018 --> 1:22:47.273
Because it puts you in jail
for the rest of your life.

1:22:57.836 --> 1:23:02.929
I am so proud of you!

1:23:03.013 --> 1:23:03.305
Yes!

1:23:07.355 --> 1:23:09.693
Are you OK?

1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:12.574
I'm more than OK, Mom.

1:23:12.699 --> 1:23:13.951
I'm ready to live life.

1:23:18.711 --> 1:23:23.971

1:23:46.433 --> 1:23:48.186
NARRATOR: The testimony
in the Stockholm Syndrome

1:23:48.354 --> 1:23:52.946
case on brainwashing was a
landmark in legal precedent.

1:23:53.071 --> 1:23:55.410
Conduct to cover up a
crime is evidence of guilt.

1:23:55.576 --> 1:23:59.876
And in this instance, the
evidence that was covered up

1:24:00.001 --> 1:24:01.170
was a woman's memory.
