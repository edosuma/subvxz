00:10.233 --> 00:12.566
You finished up
choring the other day.

00:12.900 --> 00:13.900
Fucking...

00:15.133 --> 00:17.166
Great day for hay.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.966
Wanna know
the worst part
about doing hay,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.700
is all the dust and debris
what gets up your beak.

00:22.566 --> 00:23.966
(BLOWING)

00:24.000 --> 00:26.833
Well, that's definitely
the top three worst
parts to doing hay, yeah.

00:26.866 --> 00:28.566
Fuck sakes, Dan,
clean it up.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.900
That's what I was
doing, Ms. Katys.

00:29.933 --> 00:31.433
Don't blow your nose
on your sleeve.

00:31.466 --> 00:34.566
Well, how hard actually
works if you never
blown your nose on your shirt.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.033
KATY: Why are you
taking your boots off, Dary?

00:36.066 --> 00:38.100
Is this the degen convention,
or what's the scoop?

00:38.133 --> 00:39.400
Well how hard've you
actually worked

00:39.433 --> 00:41.866
if you don't kick
your boots off
the second you're through?

00:41.900 --> 00:43.733
Keep those flippers
away from me.

00:43.766 --> 00:46.100
What? Don't wanna
my feet marinate
in my sweaty boots.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.033
I suggest you don't let
that one marinate.

00:48.066 --> 00:49.866
So you might get
toe‐nail fungus.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.266
on account of it's
so moist in there.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.666
That'll be the last time
I hear that word
coming out of your mouth.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.733
What, fungus?

00:54.766 --> 00:55.900
No.
Marinate?

00:55.933 --> 00:57.533
No.
Oh.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.366
MEN: Moist.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.800
Don't tell that
to the good folks
of Moist Jaw, Saskatchewan.

01:00.833 --> 01:05.100
Or the good folks
at Mira‐moisti where
they love shucking moysters.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.866
Don't forget about
Moistness Tennessees.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.000

a great river.

01:08.033 --> 01:09.033
You've ever been to Moisti‐Gras?

01:09.066 --> 01:11.000
No, but I've been to
the rocky Moisten‐range

01:11.033 --> 01:12.533
in the United States
of Amoistica.

01:12.566 --> 01:13.466
I will fight you.

01:30.266 --> 01:31.933
Or a Captain Moist‐gan's
and Coke.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.533
We should get her
a Moister Energy Drink ,

01:33.566 --> 01:35.100
and then we should
all go race Moisto‐cross.

01:35.133 --> 01:36.700
Race some moister trucks.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.166
I asked you first.

Not drinking at 11:00 a. m.

supposed to call you then?

from the gym, or...

a hundred years back.

bear a while back

and we got her
at a friendly price.

in your ring of honor,

saying it.

but you said it.

Fag got cut in the '80s,

05:02.833 --> 05:03.966
and may have
cleared waivers,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.800
but we all made
a gentlemen's agreement
not to sign it

detrimental to the league.

wanna bang us,
you fucking liars?

Come crash my crease,
show stopper.

05:45.766 --> 05:48.166
Two minutes for rough
and give me ten.
I'll get rougher.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.700
Fuck the blue line.
Nothin's offside
over here. Try it.

05:50.733 --> 05:53.166
I'll bulge your twine.
Just try and stop me.
You're gonna love it.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.666
Sauce me a stretch pass,
I'll sauce you a stretch ass.

a howitzer, boys.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.700

a stick on it.

Their names are
Shyla and Shania.

06:08.033 --> 06:09.966
The two newest strays
on the Rez.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.600
They stole Axe
and Slash from me.

06:11.633 --> 06:12.766
And I'm pretty sure
they're banging them,

06:12.800 --> 06:14.633
'cause they're fucking
banging everyone. Skanks!

06:14.666 --> 06:16.033
They're selling
cigarettes to kids.

06:16.066 --> 06:18.233
Yeah, well, kids are shit heads,
like the resilient ones.

06:18.266 --> 06:19.633
They'd have found the darts
one way or another, fuck.

06:19.666 --> 06:22.833
Excuse me, but I earned
the right to sell smokes
in Letterkenny,

06:22.866 --> 06:25.166
and I never sold to anyone
under high school age.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.233
I fucking checked IDs.

06:26.266 --> 06:28.200
They called me a skank.
Game on!

06:28.233 --> 06:30.600
I really miss
Axe and Slash.

06:30.633 --> 06:32.133
I'm disappointed in them.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.200
They're like
my buddies, you know.

06:33.233 --> 06:35.200
So I find them
and beat the shit
out of them?

06:35.233 --> 06:37.300
Well, I was starting to wonder
when the next scrap was coming.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.766
Was starting to think
it was never gonna come.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.300
And I'm not so sures
it's beating the shits
out of Axe and Slash

06:41.333 --> 06:43.166
is gonna makes them
come backs to you, Tanis.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.166
No, no, they need
their asses kicked.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.133
Fucking done.
Every woman knows

06:47.166 --> 06:49.066
the way to a man's heart
ain't through his zipper.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.133
Can confirm.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.200
It's through his stomach.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.766
MEN: Can confirm.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.533
And there is
a big cookout
on the Rez today,

06:55.566 --> 06:57.633
and I am the cookout Queen.

06:57.666 --> 06:58.933
Everyone comes my way.

06:58.966 --> 07:01.900
So if Axe and Slash
don't come running,
I'm a fucking chimp.

07:01.933 --> 07:03.100
What are you cooking?
What are you cooking?

07:03.133 --> 07:04.166
Everything.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.666
Bison burgers,
Walleye nuggets,
trout fillets,

07:07.700 --> 07:10.100
Venison steaks, bannock,
fried bread...

07:10.133 --> 07:12.300
and my famous Indian taco.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.000
You'll have to roll me
out of there, Tanis.

07:14.033 --> 07:15.833
Yeah, they got forklifts
on the Rez there Tanis?

07:15.866 --> 07:17.300
Then she's bought
and paid for.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.666
We cruise on in there,
eat like kings,

07:19.700 --> 07:21.100
beat the shit out
of those dudes,

07:21.133 --> 07:23.900
snatch up Axe and Slash,
and away we go.

07:23.933 --> 07:25.200
Don't say that word.
What?

07:25.233 --> 07:27.533
Oh.
MEN: Snatch.

07:27.566 --> 07:28.666
You're gonna bring up
all those rich meats,

07:28.700 --> 07:30.666
and now you don't wanna
talk about snatch‐erated fats?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.166
What you never had
a Cabbage Snatch Kid growing up?

07:32.200 --> 07:34.200
What'd you never had
a snatch‐and‐sniff sticker
when you were a kid?

07:34.233 --> 07:35.700
Everyone loves
snatch‐and‐win bingo.

07:35.733 --> 07:36.866
Fuck off.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.533
How about that Robin Williams
movie, <i>Snatch Adams?</i>

07:39.566 --> 07:41.100

heart‐strings.

of the <i>Simpsons</i> was
the <i>Itchy and Snatchy Show.</i>

07:43.066 --> 07:44.766
What, you never see
Snathural Born Killers?

07:44.800 --> 07:46.900
Margaret Snatcher was
the Prime Minister
of Great Britain.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.666
Wonder if she ever met
Benedict Cumbersnatch.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.833
He's from over there too, right?

07:49.866 --> 07:51.300
Who wrote that song
Snatch My Bitch Up?

07:51.333 --> 07:52.933
Definitely not Snatchbox 20.

07:52.966 --> 07:54.633
Or Snatching Pumpkins.
What's the problem?

07:54.666 --> 07:58.633
Shyla and Shania have a bunch
of guys with them so you
might wanna call in a favor.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.900
(MUSIC ON STEREO)

08:04.033 --> 08:06.133
I'll holler one instead. Hey!

08:07.866 --> 08:09.833
Remember when we backed
yous up on the Rez?

08:09.866 --> 08:11.700
Yeah, that time
we didn't have
the Native Flu?

08:11.733 --> 08:12.966
Payback time.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.100
Good. Because we
definitely didn't have
the Native Flu.

08:15.133 --> 08:17.300
DARYL: Snatchurally.
Scooby snatch.
What's the problem?

08:17.333 --> 08:19.033
To the Rez, pink dicks.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.700
(FINGERS SNAPPING)

08:24.800 --> 08:26.933
The hour is upon us,
Bible thumper.

08:26.966 --> 08:28.100
How'd you know, heathen?

08:28.133 --> 08:29.933
You don't even
wear a watch.

08:29.966 --> 08:31.733
What happened to
he who cast
the first stone?

08:31.766 --> 08:33.566
A broken window likely.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.733
And hopefully no one
seriously injured.

08:35.766 --> 08:38.600
Tell me, preacher,

08:38.633 --> 08:42.566
if your God found himself
in a comparable
turf war contingency,

08:42.600 --> 08:44.266
what would
Jesus do?

08:44.300 --> 08:49.033
Jesus would advocate
for empathy,
acceptance and grace.

08:49.066 --> 08:52.866
Jesus might advise you
to take a whack
at his way of life.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.200
Very well.
What?

08:54.233 --> 08:55.800
Fuck it.

08:55.833 --> 08:58.566
We will sample his style,
for the day.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.133
Oh.
Under the condition

09:01.033 --> 09:02.966
that you sample ours.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.600
I don't know, Stewart,
I'm hesitant.

09:05.633 --> 09:08.800
What happened to,
"For the Spirit God gave us
does not make us timid"?

09:08.833 --> 09:10.733
Second Timothy 1:7.

09:10.766 --> 09:15.033
Oh, you are
proving yourself
exalted, Roald.

09:15.066 --> 09:16.066
Alors?

09:18.733 --> 09:20.766
D'accord.
Allons‐y.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.800
But first,

09:22.933 --> 09:25.266
our wardrobes
crave alteration.

09:33.833 --> 09:36.600
You're just gonna let
this chicken
sit uncovered, or...

09:36.633 --> 09:38.966
Put the grill up to 500.
You wanna turn that down
a bit, or...

09:39.000 --> 09:41.033
DAN: Montreal steak spice
would help that Bison meat.

09:41.066 --> 09:42.866
So you gonna sprinkle
some on there or...

09:42.900 --> 09:46.833
Sure you wanna put those
fish and veggies on
at the same time, or...

09:46.866 --> 09:49.066
Yous wanna stop questioning
Auntie Tanis' cooking?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.566
Still you're gonna squirt
a little marinate on there,
or...

09:51.600 --> 09:52.933
Don't say that word.
What, marinate?

09:52.966 --> 09:54.900
No.
Oh.

09:54.933 --> 09:56.400
MEN: Squirt.

09:56.433 --> 09:58.900
What the fuck, Tanis,
you love Wu‐Tang Clan.
No love for Old Squirty Bastard.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.133
BOTH: Squirt McGirt.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.566
Katy, you love
Odd Future.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.100
You got no love
for Earl Sweatsquirt?

10:03.133 --> 10:04.833
What about Rush drummer
Neil Squirt?

10:04.866 --> 10:06.300
Or Squirton Cummings
of The Guess Whos?

10:06.333 --> 10:08.133
Squirtis Mayfield.
Squirt Cobain.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.900
BOTH: Too far.
Rosie loves reading
Squirt Vonnegut literature.

10:10.933 --> 10:13.066
Didn't you ever watch
that show when you were
a kid, Squirt and Ernie?

10:13.100 --> 10:15.200
Katy was watching
Squirty Dancing
just yesterday.

10:15.233 --> 10:18.166
Okay, that's a lie. I was
watching Squirty Dancing.
It's a great movie.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.900
I think it's about time
we revisit the Squirty Harry
film series.

10:20.933 --> 10:23.033
Didn't Kathryn Bigelow
direct that movie,
The Squirt Locker?

10:23.066 --> 10:25.833
We squirtnear forgot about
Jamie Lee Squrtis.
Fuck!

10:25.866 --> 10:26.800
Squirtnear.

10:26.833 --> 10:28.266
I don't want the squirt
the issue here boys,

10:28.300 --> 10:30.300
but I'm a real sucker
for pencil squirts.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.866
Mini‐squirts, boys.

10:31.900 --> 10:33.666
Fuck, Tanis, you got
a half a dozen squirt steaks

10:33.700 --> 10:34.900
on the grill right now.
What's the problem?

10:39.566 --> 10:42.133
Really though, are you
gonna squirt a little
marinade on there, or...

10:42.166 --> 10:43.300
Fuck sake.

10:43.333 --> 10:46.933
Allow me to begin
my three step tutorial
on preachin'.

10:46.966 --> 10:48.033
So here's how you start.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.833
Step one, guilt blasting'.

10:51.633 --> 10:53.266
Take to the pulpit,

10:53.300 --> 10:55.066
present yourself
to the congregation

10:55.100 --> 10:56.700
and you really
just let 'em have it.

10:56.733 --> 10:58.700
Goes something like this.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.333
You're all guilty.
You're all sinners.

11:00.366 --> 11:04.533
You're all guilty of sin.
You're all guilty
of not asking for forgiveness.

11:04.566 --> 11:06.633
Oh, I know, I know,
I know. Here we go.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.533
We skip into doopa‐doopa‐doo,

11:08.566 --> 11:10.866
acting like he isn't even there,
he doesn't even matter.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.233
Who cares about Jesus.

11:12.266 --> 11:15.033
'Till somethin' goes wrong.
Till you're served the lemons.

11:15.066 --> 11:17.233
And then suddenly it's,
"Oh, Jesus, help me.
I need you now.

11:17.266 --> 11:19.600
"I can't remember
how to make lemonade.

11:19.633 --> 11:22.033
I need your help, Jesus.
I've been bad and I'm scared
and I'm afraid.

11:22.066 --> 11:23.600
"Where's my Jesus?
Help me Jesus."

11:23.633 --> 11:26.200
Kind of mean.
Enticing. Step two?

11:26.233 --> 11:29.066
Step two. Guilt blastin'
through prayer.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.133
Five star.

11:31.166 --> 11:34.200
So, this one, you wanna dig
a little bit deeper,

11:34.233 --> 11:36.033
maybe crank everything up
to a eleven. Something...

11:36.066 --> 11:37.866
Something a little like this.
See if you can follow.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.033
Oh, Lord,

11:39.733 --> 11:41.266
it's us again.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.200
Stinky little sinners.
Human sacks of garbage!

11:44.233 --> 11:46.066
Probably already
half way to hell.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.733
You know the drill, Lord.

11:47.766 --> 11:52.533
When everything's going bad,
we come running. When
everything's good, poof!

11:52.566 --> 11:55.133
We act like your grace
is our birthright.

11:55.166 --> 11:57.133
Which it is not!

11:57.166 --> 12:00.100
Oh, I'm sure you're tired.
Lord, you must be exhausted!

12:00.133 --> 12:02.966
You already went ahead
and died for our sins.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.766
Then you went and brought
yourself back from the dead.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.966
I'm tired
just thinking about it.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.266
So you rest for a bit, Lord.
You rest.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.666
And we, we'll just
keep doing
what we do best.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.300
Paving our
own roads to hell.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.566
You know the drill. Amen!

12:17.600 --> 12:18.800
Bewitching.

12:18.833 --> 12:19.933
Oh, what's step three?

12:19.966 --> 12:22.233
Step three,
is the collection plate.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.433
Wondrous.

12:23.466 --> 12:27.000
Well, that's uh, pretty much
all sure about preachin'.

12:27.033 --> 12:29.166
So, uh, what are
your three steps?

12:31.833 --> 12:33.233
STEWART: Take this.
ROALD: Press play.

12:34.800 --> 12:38.600
BOTH: And dance.

12:38.933 --> 12:41.300
Are you meaning to do
the Bison medium well, or...

12:41.333 --> 12:44.300
Sure you want that raw chicken
so close to the veggies, or...

12:44.333 --> 12:45.266
BOTH GIRLS: Shut up!

12:45.300 --> 12:47.400
TANIS: hey! Don't talk
to them like that.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.000
Or what?
Or whatever the fuck
I want!

12:50.033 --> 12:51.866
We hear you like
to bark.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.100
But do you even bite?

12:53.133 --> 12:57.000
Maybe if you spent less
time on your backs,
yous would know.

12:57.033 --> 12:59.066
Or maybe if you
spent less time

12:59.100 --> 13:02.033
selling cigarettes
to kids, you'd know.

13:02.066 --> 13:03.533
TANIS: Uh hmm.

13:03.566 --> 13:05.533
This ain't gonna last.
Yous ain't foolin' anyone.

13:05.566 --> 13:08.066
Yes, it will.
(STAMMERS) Yeah, it will.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.333
Start thinking
with your big brain
not your little brain.

13:10.366 --> 13:12.000
They don't need you, Tanis.

13:12.033 --> 13:14.466
Nobody does.
We've got them now.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.300
There's a bit of char
on your grill, you gonna
scrape that off, or...

13:17.333 --> 13:18.833
You gonna bump
that heat down or...

13:18.866 --> 13:22.166
What's that?
Is that a little
trouble in paradise?

13:22.200 --> 13:25.133
You never complained about
Auntie Tanis's cooking.
Just sayin'.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.200
BOTH: Enough!
You tarts can't handle

13:27.233 --> 13:29.833
a barbeque, let alone
handle your scandal.

13:29.866 --> 13:31.500
I can see your
clammy hands
from here.

13:31.533 --> 13:32.966
Do not say that word.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.433
I hate that word.

13:34.466 --> 13:36.066
Which one?
DAN: Oh...

13:36.100 --> 13:37.700
ALL: Clammy!

13:37.733 --> 13:40.333
Let's just pump the brakes
and quick fuckin' sec here
your friends in clamellia.

the clam‐meat
and potatoes of it.

13:42.233 --> 13:43.900
What'd, you never listen
to Clammy Davis Junior?
What's up?

13:43.933 --> 13:47.533
Clammy Hagar's the superior
Val Halen vocalist. I don't
care what anyone else says.

13:47.566 --> 13:49.933
Clammy Sosa use to hit
them big dingers.

13:49.966 --> 13:51.933
What, you never listen
to Clammy Wynette?
What's the problem?

13:51.966 --> 13:53.333
Shut up!
Nuff talkin'.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.533
Nuff chin waggin'.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.066
Which one of yous
called my sister
a skank?

14:00.133 --> 14:04.066
Oh, there's not much
I can do about
this one, kiddo.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.400
It's all right, boo.
I got her.

14:06.433 --> 14:07.733
Fuck sake.
When's the next
scrap comin'?

14:07.766 --> 14:10.033
Starting to think
it's never gonna
fuckin' come, fuck.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.000
AXE: You gonna give
those nuggets
a flip soon, or...

14:12.033 --> 14:13.433
Want me to do it, or...

Hi, Katy‐Kat.

Pete and repeat. Ola.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.066
So, uh, we were just,
we were just wondering...

15:24.100 --> 15:26.066
Like we're partners.
Kind of.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.900
Um, and we work
well really together

15:28.933 --> 15:30.266
So like, we were
wondering if...

15:30.300 --> 15:32.300
If I would date both
of you again.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.700
REILLY: Actually, yes.
Yeah.

15:33.733 --> 15:38.266
The truth is, guys,
I don't really want
to date either of you.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.533
It's just not really
the right time.

15:40.566 --> 15:41.900
BOTH BOYS: Oh.

15:41.933 --> 15:44.466
And now it's just
you guys, so,

15:44.500 --> 15:45.966

Big city slams.

boys!

you still prefer pussy
over a meal made
by Auntie Tanis?

BOTH: They don't
need you, anymore.

16:02.933 --> 16:04.466
You know what I heard.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.900
You guys aren't the only ones
in there. Better watch out
for that yeast.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.833
Do not say that word.

16:09.866 --> 16:10.933
Which one, pussy?
No.

it's a great movie.

You look more suited
to the Witches of Yeastwick.

Or the Yeast Enders.
Done it.

is Give Yeast a Chance.

has the rips.

Yes?

Did any of those rips
survive?

17:11.166 --> 17:13.300
Oh, sure. All of them.
I didn't touch it.

But how did you...

compels me, Stewart.

You're foolin' us.
No.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.000
I tricked you.

not a sin.

Didn't kill you, did it?
No.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.233
As it turns out,
God is actually

17:32.533 --> 17:34.300
pretty metal.
Well, of course he's metal.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.033
Ain't you never heard
of P. O. D.?

17:36.066 --> 17:38.100
We concede, Glen.
Oh.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.266
You have
electrified us
here today.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.400
Oh.
We agree to cut
the pie.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.466
Divvy it up?
Yes.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.433
We can share
the Dollar Store
parking lot.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.133
Hurray!

17:49.166 --> 17:51.033
But you're gonna be
on your way now.

17:51.066 --> 17:55.033
GLEN: Woo!

17:55.066 --> 17:57.366
I'm... I'm done
with this Indian Taco.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.866
I'd invite yous over
but you're too busy
fuckin' up, so...

18:00.900 --> 18:02.533
BOTH: They don't need
you anymore.

18:02.566 --> 18:03.566
Chicken's dry.

18:04.533 --> 18:06.133
What?
Nothing.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.166
No. What did you say?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.333
Chicken's dry.
I can hardly
swallow it.

18:10.366 --> 18:11.900
You want it
to be a bit moist.

18:11.933 --> 18:14.066
Argh. Don't say that word.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.900
What word?
Oh.

18:16.566 --> 18:17.700
ALL: Moist.

18:17.733 --> 18:19.933
What? You've never watched
<i>Mickey and Minnie Moist</i>

18:19.966 --> 18:21.600
growing up? You outta
your fuckin' mind?

18:21.633 --> 18:23.233
Ronald Moist Donald.

18:23.266 --> 18:25.333
Seein' my buddy Ben
on Moisture Chefs Canadas?

18:25.366 --> 18:27.566
No. But I'm all caught up
on How to Moist a Murder.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.866
Fuck those Avery's really
put their foots in it now, eh?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.900
My favorite show
is America's Moist Wanted.

18:31.933 --> 18:34.600
You gotta respect
athleticisms,
Connor Moist‐Gregor,

18:34.633 --> 18:36.600
Conner Moist‐David,
Floyd Moist‐Weather.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.366
Boy, they're all
at the top of their classes.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.833
They're all driving
Moist‐eradis, that's
all I know.

18:40.866 --> 18:44.033
May even a Rolls Moist.
Or maybe a Moist‐cedes Benz.

18:44.066 --> 18:46.600
No Moist‐subishis
eclipses in this bunch.

18:46.633 --> 18:48.866
They're not using
Capital One Moister‐Cards.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.466
Nope. They got
Amex Black likely.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.433
Moist money,
moist problems.
You're bum scum, bud.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.233
Sled Ted?

19:05.233 --> 19:06.233
Rat Ass?

19:07.966 --> 19:09.466
Jivin' fuckin' Pete.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.833
They've assembled
the Degen All‐Stars.

19:13.866 --> 19:16.066
Their organization
is baffling.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.400
The fuck's your name
anyway, bud?

19:17.433 --> 19:21.466
Alistair Orson Westwood Yates.
Baffling.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.400
My name is...
Shut the fuck up.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.566
Let's see you back
it up now, bitch.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.000
Tanis!

19:30.033 --> 19:31.533
We're gonna get
our asses kicked.

19:31.566 --> 19:33.966
KATY: Not our pig,
not our farm, boys.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.200
Yous don't need me
anymore, remember?

19:36.233 --> 19:39.433
I, uh, have kind of been
wondering when the next
scrap is coming. Oh, fuck.

19:40.433 --> 19:41.433
Wait for it.

19:48.433 --> 19:51.200
We're so sorry, Auntie.
We wanna come back.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.466
We miss you, Tanis.
You took care of us.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.200
We promise, we'll never get
blinded by the pussy again.

19:56.233 --> 19:58.600
We'll swear off
the pussy
for two weeks.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.566
See what happened here
today, ladies.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.800
The way to a man's heart
ain' through his zipper.

20:05.566 --> 20:07.066
Tanis.
Hmm?

20:08.633 --> 20:09.900
Let's have a scrap.

20:09.933 --> 20:12.233
About fuckin' time.
I started to think
it was never gonna come.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

21:55.533 --> 21:57.733
Hmm, this is ever good
there, Auntie.

21:57.766 --> 21:59.066
I know.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.500
Thanks, Tanis.

22:00.533 --> 22:04.200
Auntie Tanis
always takes care
of her cubs, way‐hey!

22:04.233 --> 22:06.200
I was a bit worried
when we were cooking
the raw chicken

22:06.233 --> 22:08.466
so close to the veg, but...
WAYNE: Axe!

22:10.200 --> 22:12.200
I fuckin' hate that word.

22:12.233 --> 22:13.700
DARYL: What word?
Oh.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.266
BOTH GIRLS: Veg.
Let me talk you of
the vedge, big brother.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.266
I guess we're not gonna
vedge allegiance to
the flag then, eh?

22:18.300 --> 22:20.500
Have a dart?
Have a Benson and Vedges.

22:20.533 --> 22:23.066
Oh, you don't like
Peter Gabriel? That
fucker wrote Vedge‐Hammer.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.800
Stevie Nicks.
Vedge of Seventeen.

22:24.833 --> 22:26.366
Stevie Nicks
is a fuckin' vegendary.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.666
Aerosmith,
Living on the Vedge.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.700
Heath Vedger.
JONESY: Vegendary.

22:29.733 --> 22:33.033
You didn't like Edie Vedge‐Wick?
That fucker married Kevin Bacon.

22:33.066 --> 22:34.466
No, no, no, no, no.
That was Keira Vedgewick.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.366
Edie Vedge‐Wick
was Warhol's girl.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.500
Well, I happen to know
for a fact that Dan has

22:38.533 --> 22:41.233
a full vedge boner
for any Vedge‐wick.

22:41.266 --> 22:42.733
Avegedly.
Vegitimately.

22:42.766 --> 22:46.266
Vedge of Tomorrow
starring Tom Cruise
and Emily Blunt.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.866
Amazing movie.
TANIS: Uh‐huh.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.066
Well, I don't think you're
going to get a word
in here, vegde‐wish good buddy.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.600
Prepare the Vegiment.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.666
Take them veg or alive.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.266
Vegiment!

22:59.600 --> 23:00.700
Fire!
