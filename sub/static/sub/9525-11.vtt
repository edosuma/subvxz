08:46.400 --> 08:47.877
[Whispering] Yeah.
Ders, go order a pizza.

08:48.002 --> 08:49.579
[Whispering]
They don't serve pizza here.

08:49.704 --> 08:50.906
It's a sandwich place.

08:51.172 --> 08:53.315
Do you think
they'll deliver pizza here,

08:53.440 --> 08:55.160
like, if we order from a pizza place?

08:55.326 --> 08:58.914
Do you have a punch card?
[Kazoo humming]

08:59.080 --> 09:00.779
You punched this yourself,
didn't you?

09:00.904 --> 09:01.708
[Kazoo hums]

09:01.874 --> 09:03.835
All right, you know what?
Get out. We're done.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.462
Beat it.
[Kazoo hums]

09:05.628 --> 09:07.422
Don't take that sandwich!
I will call the cops!

09:07.588 --> 09:09.331
Hey, hang on a second,
hang on a second.

09:09.456 --> 09:11.867
I'll pay for his food.
Look, he's...

09:11.992 --> 09:15.430
He's my dad, so I'm very embarrassed.

09:15.662 --> 09:18.517
I'm sure your dad's embarrassed
you from time to time.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.677
No, he hasn't.
He's... he has great judgment.

09:21.802 --> 09:23.605
He would never do
something like this.

09:23.771 --> 09:27.049
You've been following me all day?

09:27.174 --> 09:29.528
Eh, since, like, 9:00 a.m.

09:29.744 --> 09:31.029
So you saw me...?

09:31.195 --> 09:33.073
Mm-hmm.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.624
Yes. You've gotta teach me
how to do that.

09:34.749 --> 09:36.926
Believe me, you don't
wanna go down that road.

09:37.051 --> 09:38.293
It's the only road I want to go down.

09:38.418 --> 09:39.913
Anyway, look,

09:40.079 --> 09:41.230
we're just looking for dirt on you,

09:41.355 --> 09:43.332
so we can beat Montez at roasting.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.434
I hate this stupid roast.
I already know I'm a loser.

09:45.559 --> 09:47.379
I don't need the whole office
telling me so.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.090
- You got a bunch of...
- Montez is ruthless.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.883
- I don't even want to go.
- Whoa, whoa, okay.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.476
That means we don't get to roast.

09:54.601 --> 09:56.378
Bill, what you're forgetting
here is that...

09:56.503 --> 09:58.118
You're the guest of honor, right?

09:58.243 --> 10:00.086
- Yeah.
- So you get the last word.

10:00.211 --> 10:01.450
We can take Montez down together.

10:01.575 --> 10:02.477
Yep.

10:02.709 --> 10:05.755
What about that dickhead Jet Set?

10:05.880 --> 10:08.658
You teach me how to...

10:08.783 --> 10:10.159
[Choking]

10:10.284 --> 10:13.572
Myself, and we've got a deal.

10:13.788 --> 10:15.365
Well, you gotta be big.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.666
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:16.791 --> 10:17.826
Holy Moly.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.206

10:29.445 --> 10:33.425
[Cheers and applause]

10:33.591 --> 10:37.846
And I'm out.
Have fun roasting this bald pig.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.431
Great job, Bradley!

10:39.597 --> 10:41.850
Who's Bradley?
I'm Tony Clifton, you asshole.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.227
Wake up!
All: Oh!

10:44.393 --> 10:47.362
Bill treat his nose
like the hometown buffet!

10:47.487 --> 10:48.798
What's the worst job in the world?

10:48.923 --> 10:50.232
Being Bill's pants, 'cause you know

10:50.357 --> 10:51.818
you're gonna get dookied on!
[Laughter]

10:51.984 --> 10:54.336
He has a booger pasta bar,
a booger dessert bar,

10:54.461 --> 10:55.989
a booger serving station...

10:56.155 --> 10:59.868
Yes, Bill, you look like
a goddamn child molester.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.812
Bill be picking his boogers
like he Orville Redenbacher.

11:02.937 --> 11:04.814
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!
[Laughter]

11:04.939 --> 11:06.949
I got three words for you, brother.

11:07.074 --> 11:10.686
Wash your stinkin' ass!

11:10.811 --> 11:12.888
[Laughter]

11:13.013 --> 11:16.927
Okay, our next roasters wanted
to do it as a threesome.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.472
And they also wanted
to perform together.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.264
All right, let's give it up
for Adam, Anders, and Blake!

11:22.389 --> 11:24.601
- Whoo!
- Shagadelic!

11:24.825 --> 11:27.896
Do I make you Randy, baby?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.805
Shwing!
[Laughs]

11:29.930 --> 11:34.877
Tickle, tickle, break the pickle.

11:35.002 --> 11:36.445
Excellent.

11:36.570 --> 11:37.656
[British accent]
We were listening out there,

11:37.872 --> 11:39.407
you know, and you guys were

11:39.573 --> 11:41.784
roasting Bill pretty hard.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.352
And he's my mate,

11:43.477 --> 11:47.013
so I'm here to tell you
to behave, baby, yeah!

11:47.540 --> 11:48.657
All right.

11:48.782 --> 11:52.694
We're not worthy
of such a great co-worker.

11:52.819 --> 11:56.007
We're not worthy!
We're not worthy!

11:56.223 --> 11:57.843
[All boo]

11:58.092 --> 12:00.669
I got it.

12:00.794 --> 12:03.025
[Indian accent]
Mariska Hargitay.

12:05.732 --> 12:09.078
Mari-ska Hargitay!

12:09.203 --> 12:10.980
[Crowd booing loudly]

12:11.105 --> 12:12.399
- [Siren wails]
- Y'all stop!

12:12.565 --> 12:14.250
Tickle, tickle, break the pickle.

12:14.375 --> 12:15.360
You already did this.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.653
- Hey, come on.
- Ow!

12:16.877 --> 12:18.238
That hurt my ankle.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.906
Have you guys really not seen
<i>Love Guru?</i>

12:20.072 --> 12:21.950
It's a funny, funny movie.

12:22.482 --> 12:23.993
- Mike Myers is in it.
- Yeah, <i>Wayne's World One.</i>

12:24.118 --> 12:25.861
It's, like,
one of the biggest comedies

12:25.986 --> 12:26.997
- of, like, the early mid-2000s.
- All right, all right, look.

12:27.254 --> 12:28.463
We're sorry you don't like

12:28.588 --> 12:29.958
our characters, but we're funny guys.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.733
And we followed Bill this weekend.

12:31.858 --> 12:33.128
And guess what he does
on the weekend?

12:33.294 --> 12:34.921
He paints himself silver like a robot

12:35.087 --> 12:37.674
and goes on the street
and begs for money.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.719
And then... and then we also
caught him stealing a sandwich,

12:40.885 --> 12:44.055
because he's that poor, guys.
[Laughter]

12:44.221 --> 12:45.948
This isn't what we planned.
What are you doing?

12:46.073 --> 12:48.217
It's all true. It's all true.
We followed him.

12:48.342 --> 12:49.785
And guess what we saw?

12:49.910 --> 12:52.439
We saw this broke-ass fool
suck his own dick!

12:52.605 --> 12:54.399
What?
[Laughter]

12:54.565 --> 12:56.610
- He's good at it.
- That's hilarious.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.361
Enough!

12:59.053 --> 13:01.031
You guys said you were on my side!

13:01.288 --> 13:03.033
- Sure, whatever, man.
- They love it, man.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.301
You're right.
My life is a joke.

13:05.426 --> 13:06.828
But I have news for you!
[Gun cocks]

13:07.061 --> 13:09.247

13:27.640 --> 13:29.692
I don't want anyone ruining
my big day!

13:29.817 --> 13:31.060
Hey, Bill, what are you doing?

13:31.185 --> 13:33.061
Okay, please, just put the gun down.

13:33.186 --> 13:34.522
You heard the lady.
Put it down.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.648
Or what?

13:35.956 --> 13:38.151
You're making a big mistake, man.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.236
Don't do something
you're gonna regret, man.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.038
Something I regret?
I regret my entire life!

13:43.163 --> 13:44.240
What?

13:44.406 --> 13:45.641
A good-looking guy like yourself?

13:45.766 --> 13:47.142
No, no, no!
Please don't kill me!

13:47.267 --> 13:48.510
I wish this was all a dream!

13:48.635 --> 13:50.713
Doodle-ooh, doodle-ooh, doodle-ooh.

13:50.838 --> 13:53.382
Stop, stop, I got this.
Look, okay...

13:53.507 --> 13:55.877
Bill, if anyone knows what it's
like to be picked on, it's me.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.004
My father was
a relentlessly self-improving

13:58.170 --> 14:00.622
boulangerie owner from Belgium
with low-grade narcolepsy

14:00.747 --> 14:02.759
and a penchant for buggery.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.469
Shut up and help me
lock this place down,

14:04.635 --> 14:05.678
- Mr. Powers.
- Okay, all right.

14:05.844 --> 14:08.640
Okay, his back's turned.
Let's do this.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.899
- Do what?
- Roll on him!

14:11.024 --> 14:13.019
Grab the gun
and bring him to justice.

14:13.185 --> 14:16.472
Get my reward.

14:16.597 --> 14:19.842
Don't... oh, don't be stupid.

14:19.967 --> 14:24.279
Too late.

14:24.404 --> 14:27.182
Welcome to staples center...
Bitch.

14:27.307 --> 14:28.326
Aah!

14:28.542 --> 14:32.122
[All shouting]

14:34.206 --> 14:36.543
- Oh, gosh!
- Come with me!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.211
Now!

14:43.390 --> 14:45.333
Good-bye...

14:45.458 --> 14:46.802
Forever.

14:46.927 --> 14:51.224
Adam.

14:51.390 --> 14:57.272
Turn around!

14:57.504 --> 15:00.066
[Both laughing]

15:00.306 --> 15:02.384
- They bought it, right?
- Oh, totally!

15:02.509 --> 15:04.085
Oh, I'm sorry I did
the stapler thing.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.864
I just felt... I really felt like
that was in the moment,

15:06.030 --> 15:07.022
- you know?
- No, no, that was good.

15:07.147 --> 15:08.323
It sold it.
It was hilarious.

15:08.448 --> 15:09.792
- It did sell it, right?
- Yeah!

15:09.917 --> 15:11.059
I was feeling it!
It was incredible.

15:11.184 --> 15:12.428
Ders and Blake did a good job too.

15:12.553 --> 15:13.762
Like, we can't forget about them.

15:13.887 --> 15:14.789
You did great!

15:15.121 --> 15:16.499
Okay, so what's next?

15:16.665 --> 15:18.199
All right, everybody just be calm.

15:18.324 --> 15:21.069
Adam's probably in there
telling Bill to turn himself in.

15:21.194 --> 15:24.007
It's gonna be over soon.
[Gunshots]

15:28.927 --> 15:30.263
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.182
What have you done?

15:32.405 --> 15:33.683
Anyone else wanna be a hero?

15:33.849 --> 15:37.562
You need help, man.
Bill, let us help you.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.158
- You want to help me?
- Yes, Bill.

15:40.283 --> 15:41.790
Maybe you should have thought of that

15:41.915 --> 15:44.027
before you said I ate my boogers!

15:44.193 --> 15:45.627
Bill, I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

15:45.752 --> 15:48.823
- It was a roast.
- Then show me you're sorry.

15:48.989 --> 15:53.502
I want you to pick
every nose here and eat it,

15:53.627 --> 15:54.913
one by one!

15:55.079 --> 15:57.439
What?
Come on, Bill.

15:57.564 --> 15:59.542
Dude, eat their boogers!

15:59.708 --> 16:01.503
He's not messing around.
He just killed Adam.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.412
Bill, sir,
if Montez does what you say,

16:04.537 --> 16:05.914
will you let us all live?

16:06.039 --> 16:08.218
He eats every booger,
and I'll consider it.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.469
Okay.

16:09.710 --> 16:11.520
Why don't you start with Waymond?

16:11.645 --> 16:12.889
He looks a little stuffy.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.891
Come on, Bill.
Put the gun down, Bill.

16:15.057 --> 16:19.361
Montez, save a life.
Eat a booger.

16:19.486 --> 16:20.772
I'm sorry, Waymond.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.696
I can't... ugh.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.615
Oh.
[Chuckles]

16:30.781 --> 16:33.701
Oh, God, he's eating it.

16:33.867 --> 16:37.413
- [All groan]
- Oh, I can't...

16:37.579 --> 16:40.048
you know what would
make this perfect?

16:40.173 --> 16:42.794
If Jet shits his pants...

16:42.960 --> 16:44.686
- Hell, no!
- While you're digging for gold.

16:44.811 --> 16:47.173
Everybody wins!

16:47.339 --> 16:48.724
Bill, no!
Don't make him do it.

16:48.849 --> 16:50.552
Never question my authority,

16:50.718 --> 16:52.887
unless you want everyone to die.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.141
Let me do it for him.
I'll shit my pants right now!

16:56.515 --> 16:58.123
- Whoa, uh, no, J-Jillian...
- Okay.

16:58.248 --> 16:59.811
Just let him handle his thing.
Thank you, though.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.994
- No, I have it in me right now.
- You're very brave.

17:02.119 --> 17:04.107
Think about what you doing
right now, Bill.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.650
Stop this.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.151
I am thinking!
Do it!

17:07.317 --> 17:11.155
Oh, God.
[Operatic music]

17:11.320 --> 17:15.272
[All gagging]

17:15.397 --> 17:18.538
- [All groaning]
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

17:19.869 --> 17:22.814
[Blake laughing]

17:22.939 --> 17:25.717
Eat it!

17:25.842 --> 17:28.486
[All groan]

17:28.611 --> 17:32.635
I can't. I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't. I can't.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.221
[Farts]

17:35.387 --> 17:36.639
[All reacting]

17:36.805 --> 17:41.166
Okay, everyone,
I have an announcement!

17:41.291 --> 17:44.147
- This whole thing...
- Bill, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.804
Uh, before you make
that announcement,

17:45.929 --> 17:48.735
you had something else
you wanted to say, remember?

17:48.902 --> 17:50.945
You wanted Ders here

17:51.111 --> 17:53.612
to admit that <i>Wayne's World</i>
is a better movie

17:53.737 --> 17:55.825
than <i>Austin Powers,</i>
or he'll kill him!

17:55.991 --> 17:58.536
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.952
Okay, sure, uh...

18:00.077 --> 18:01.386
Say what Blake said,
or I'll kill you!

18:01.511 --> 18:04.289
Yeah.

18:04.414 --> 18:06.191
Well, then I guess
you're gonna have to kill me,

18:06.316 --> 18:09.595
because that's a goddamn lie,
and I don't lie.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.397
I will admit that it blows
<i>Love Guru</i> out of the water.

18:12.522 --> 18:13.865
<i>Wayne's World</i>
is better than <i>Love Guru.</i>

18:13.990 --> 18:15.233
- I'll say that.
- Well, obviously.

18:15.358 --> 18:17.168
That's really not saying
anything, okay?

18:17.293 --> 18:20.558
Because <i>Wayne's World</i>
is better than <i>Austin Powers</i>

18:20.724 --> 18:21.893
- and <i>Love Guru</i> combined.
- Oh-ho!

18:22.060 --> 18:23.811
- It has the funniest lines!
- You know what?

18:23.977 --> 18:26.064
I feel like I'm surrounded
by freakin' idiots.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.713
- No way. Way!
- Shh! Shh!

18:27.838 --> 18:29.192
- No way. Way!
- Shh!

18:29.359 --> 18:31.316
Camera one, camera two.
Camera one, camera two.

18:31.441 --> 18:33.905
- Stop! Sto...
- Praise Buddha.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.699
I am reincarnated.

18:36.865 --> 18:42.830
I am once again the <i>Love Guru!</i>

18:42.996 --> 18:44.999
What in the fuck?

18:45.165 --> 18:47.001
I can't believe you would talk
trash on another man's comedy

18:47.167 --> 18:50.755
when he's not even in the room...
very Wayne move of you.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.590
- Bill, shoot Wayne in the face.
- I wouldn't even call your

18:52.756 --> 18:53.758
movie a comedy, really.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.406
- Justin Timberlake?
- Oh, my God.

18:55.531 --> 18:57.109
That man is a quadruple threat.

18:57.234 --> 18:58.810
- He's a singer.
- He is so... so many threats.

18:58.935 --> 19:00.311
He's not a comedic actor.
He's a dancer.

19:00.436 --> 19:01.849
I'm threatened by so many...

19:02.015 --> 19:04.616
- on the floor, now!
- Oh, my God! Oh!

19:04.741 --> 19:06.229
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

19:06.396 --> 19:08.189
- It was a mistake!
- It was a joke! It was a joke!

19:14.778 --> 19:16.364
{pub}- Don't move!
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

19:16.530 --> 19:18.854
This is all just a misunderstanding.
Alright?

19:18.979 --> 19:20.606
We're just trying to be funny,
but guys,

19:20.731 --> 19:22.317
this one was not as funny
as we thought it was.

19:22.442 --> 19:25.453
That's right.
It wasn't very at all.

19:26.506 --> 19:27.830
But this is...

19:29.376 --> 19:31.337
It was a joke, you bitch!

19:33.130 --> 19:34.232
What the fug?

19:34.357 --> 19:36.759
These guys are my SWAT army.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.832
Thanks guys, worked like a charm.

19:38.957 --> 19:40.269
Good luck on your book, B-rad.

19:40.394 --> 19:41.807
Sounds like some real gritty stuff.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.195
I know, I'm running it!

19:46.407 --> 19:47.728
Bill called me last night

19:47.894 --> 19:50.606
to make sure your little performance
didn't get him into any trouble.

19:50.772 --> 19:51.941
I'm sorry.

19:52.554 --> 19:54.217
- You're such a loser.
- Wow, OK Bill.

19:54.342 --> 19:55.954
And you know what's weird?

19:56.079 --> 19:59.866
As I seem to remember someone saying:
"Chicks aren't funny".

20:00.609 --> 20:02.159
God, I love you.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.537
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

20:04.845 --> 20:06.983
None of this was funny at all.

20:07.896 --> 20:11.090
You'd have me eat Jet Set's boogers.
Now, is that anything?

20:11.215 --> 20:13.340
And this poor bastard got dookie
in his pants.

20:14.902 --> 20:16.064
I don't mind.

20:16.189 --> 20:18.676
Plus, this was a good cause.
Congratulations, Bill.

20:19.488 --> 20:22.176
I gotta go.
Can't stand all that mess on me.

20:23.926 --> 20:25.576
Good night, my dudes.

20:25.701 --> 20:27.310
Good night, babe.

20:34.076 --> 20:35.650
Come to papa!

20:53.782 --> 20:54.587
My back!

20:54.753 --> 20:58.591
