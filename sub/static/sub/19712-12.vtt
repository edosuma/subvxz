Claudia: The man you
photographed Evgheniya with

00:27.576 --> 00:30.244
is an SIS-1 officer.

00:30.245 --> 00:32.937
The Centre will probably want
her back in Moscow with him

00:32.962 --> 00:35.053
so they can use the affair against him.

00:35.054 --> 00:37.798
There's these kids at
school. Real assholes.

00:37.823 --> 00:39.290
If I got in with them...

00:39.315 --> 00:41.868
they could make things
really bad for pasha.

00:41.893 --> 00:44.959
Bad enough that his mother will
want to take him home to Moscow?

00:44.960 --> 00:47.990
When you're walking in the
dark you don't know the answer,

00:47.996 --> 00:51.732
but you have an instinct
for how to move forward.

00:51.733 --> 00:54.802
We're all machines.

00:54.803 --> 00:56.603
I want to get out of here.

00:56.605 --> 00:58.571
We should just go.

01:00.772 --> 01:02.407
I mean it.

01:07.581 --> 01:09.481
Pastor Tim: So, who's going
to the pantry with Mary?

01:09.484 --> 01:10.674
- I'm going.
- I'm going.

01:10.699 --> 01:12.349
- I'm going, too.
- Yeah? You guys have rides home?

01:12.354 --> 01:13.354
- Yeah.
- Yep.

01:13.355 --> 01:14.785
- Yeah.
- All right, okay.

01:14.789 --> 01:16.119
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

01:16.124 --> 01:18.094
You guys did a great
job. See you Thursday.

01:18.095 --> 01:19.960
- See ya. Shotgun!
- Bye.

01:19.961 --> 01:21.734
Young woman: Bye. Thank you.

01:22.164 --> 01:25.008
(Engine starts)

01:25.033 --> 01:28.726
Hey, how's that college list coming?

01:28.751 --> 01:32.500
Oh, uhm... I-I know I should
be thinking about it, but...

01:32.507 --> 01:34.078
Oh. You've got a lot on your mind.

01:34.103 --> 01:36.046
Yeah. I was thinking
about George Washington,

01:36.047 --> 01:37.511
but... I don't know.

01:37.512 --> 01:40.322
Well, I'm sure you'll
have lots of choices.

01:40.323 --> 01:43.469
So, listen, I need
to tell you something.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.378
I have been offered a job

01:45.387 --> 01:47.827
with the World Council of
Churches in Buenos Aires,

01:47.852 --> 01:51.211
running their interfaith mission.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.547
Buenos Aires?

01:53.572 --> 01:55.635
The offer just came out of the blue,

01:55.636 --> 01:58.666
and we're going to take it.

01:59.733 --> 02:01.471
- Wow. I...
- (Chuckles)

02:02.871 --> 02:05.229
- (Sighs) Wow.
- I know.

02:06.006 --> 02:07.940
We're going to miss you, Paige.

02:11.345 --> 02:15.229
You and Alice have been really...

02:16.073 --> 02:17.712
really good to me.

02:17.719 --> 02:20.549
Meeting you changed everything for me.

02:20.555 --> 02:23.090
Well, we're going to keep in touch.

02:23.091 --> 02:26.291
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

02:28.696 --> 02:30.799
Who's going to... um,
who'll be the pastor?

02:30.824 --> 02:32.935
I-I just told the board last night.

02:32.936 --> 02:34.364
There will be a hiring committee.

02:34.369 --> 02:36.565
It's two months before I leave.

02:38.112 --> 02:41.172
We love our life here, the congregation.

02:41.176 --> 02:44.945
But we just started
talking about Claire Louise,

02:44.946 --> 02:47.581
growing up seeing more of the world,

02:47.582 --> 02:49.869
speaking Spanish...

02:50.366 --> 02:54.033
I was down there after
college, in Ecuador.

02:55.056 --> 02:57.625
Being bilingual would be great for her.

02:57.626 --> 02:58.979
I know.

03:00.028 --> 03:01.858
I just hope Claire Louise grows up

03:01.863 --> 03:03.877
to have as big a heart as you.

03:11.416 --> 03:13.016
Philip: Hello?

03:13.041 --> 03:14.901
Hey.

03:14.909 --> 03:17.369
(Utensils clanking)

03:28.360 --> 03:32.579
So... Pastor Tim is leaving.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.991
He took a job in Argentina.

03:36.998 --> 03:39.558
At the World Council of Churches.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.335
That's great.

03:42.191 --> 03:43.804
Yeah.

03:43.805 --> 03:46.988
It's good when things
can work out for everyone.

03:48.175 --> 03:53.180
I think it's almost more
about Claire Louise than them.

03:53.181 --> 03:55.925
They want her to see more of the world.

03:56.550 --> 04:00.478
That's nice. Thinking
about her speaking Spanish.

04:00.503 --> 04:05.183
Yeah. That's... that's what he said.

04:07.094 --> 04:12.253
How... exactly did you get him this job?

04:13.434 --> 04:17.303
The Soviet Union has
worked hard for peace.

04:17.305 --> 04:18.704
It has a lot of friends

04:18.707 --> 04:21.107
in a lot of organizations
all around the world.

04:21.108 --> 04:23.009
Religious organizations?

04:23.011 --> 04:25.341
Well, some of them fight for justice,

04:25.347 --> 04:28.187
which is good enough for us.

04:38.710 --> 04:40.140
(Sighs)

04:55.209 --> 04:56.637
Philip: Paige.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.301
(Rustling)

05:14.695 --> 05:17.271
You have to wear it until he's gone.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.994

11:09.662 --> 11:12.092

good. (Clears throat)

12:02.252 --> 12:04.791
- Okay...
- Only to say...

12:04.799 --> 12:08.095
that I... that I
understand what is going on.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.354
And I am not political.

12:11.379 --> 12:13.081
And...

12:13.792 --> 12:16.792
Your country, my country...

12:16.796 --> 12:18.486
for me, important, you know,

12:18.511 --> 12:22.834
both sides try to
understand and get along.

12:22.835 --> 12:25.904
No war. I hate war.

12:25.905 --> 12:27.805
- Yeah.
- Okay...

12:27.807 --> 12:31.750
So, Ilia will be my son now.

12:31.775 --> 12:34.345
And Sofia will be my wife.

12:34.370 --> 12:38.659
And my most desire is that
they are happy and... and safe

12:38.684 --> 12:41.314
and there is no trouble for them...

12:41.320 --> 12:42.687
Stan: Uh-huh.

12:42.712 --> 12:46.901
... and you helped people I really love.

12:46.926 --> 12:50.695
And we are on the same side, it means.

12:50.696 --> 12:53.264
I just want you to know

12:53.265 --> 12:55.865
that there is nothing
to worry about from me.

12:55.868 --> 12:59.468
I-I come today because
I want you to know that.

12:59.471 --> 13:00.921
Sofia: Mm-hmm.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.937
Aderholt: All right. Great.

13:05.674 --> 13:07.214
That's it?

13:08.313 --> 13:10.309
Gennadi: Just one question.

13:10.334 --> 13:13.312
Sofia say you pay her

13:13.319 --> 13:16.685
five hundred dollars every month.

13:17.823 --> 13:19.762
That's right.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.818
She is shy to ask,

13:21.843 --> 13:24.673
but... it's dangerous what she's doing.

13:24.697 --> 13:28.566
Maybe she should get more, yes?

13:28.567 --> 13:31.537
Seven hundred dollars, at least.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.301
Think about it.

13:35.326 --> 13:37.204
If it makes everything better,

13:37.209 --> 13:39.895
I could be big help for you.

13:41.294 --> 13:43.142
I am a courier, so...

13:43.148 --> 13:47.786
Maybe we can work together too.

13:49.088 --> 13:52.557
(Laughs) I am sorry
that I'm so businessman.

13:52.558 --> 13:56.053
I just really want good things for my...

13:56.085 --> 13:57.786

14:03.902 --> 14:07.194
Pastor Tim took the job in Argentina.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.780
When does he leave?

14:09.781 --> 14:11.354
Two months.

14:12.011 --> 14:14.236
Paige feels good about it.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.604
Good.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.785
We've been talking about
whether it's time...

14:27.810 --> 14:30.157
for us to end our tour here.

14:42.473 --> 14:44.417
I understand.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.320
I've found when officers start
to think seriously about it,

14:52.321 --> 14:54.294
it's usually time.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.927
When you're ready, I'll have the Centre

14:58.928 --> 15:01.411
start putting things in place.

15:03.561 --> 15:05.730
Thank you.

15:05.731 --> 15:08.800
It takes two or three
years to really adjust.

15:08.801 --> 15:10.401
Longer for the kids, of course.

15:10.402 --> 15:15.702
But people don't usually
regret coming home.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.855
What about the kids?

15:24.880 --> 15:27.820
They have very interesting lives.

15:30.021 --> 15:31.661
I don't know what you're thinking.

15:31.662 --> 15:35.579
But I wouldn't tell
Henry until you're there.

15:46.511 --> 15:48.280

15:48.281 --> 15:50.749

17:58.043 --> 17:59.817
What is this?

18:02.067 --> 18:03.410
Oh, it's for your dryer.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.846
So your clothes don't...
stick to each other.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.851
Clothes don't stick to each other.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.588
(Both chuckle)

18:10.589 --> 18:12.481
Well, a little bit.

18:13.058 --> 18:14.825
(Laughing)

18:16.129 --> 18:18.043
Pashenka! (Gasps)

18:22.670 --> 18:24.082
Pashenka!

18:46.392 --> 18:47.926
Someone hit him.

(Sighs)

18:50.575 --> 18:52.153
Oh, Dee,

18:52.965 --> 18:55.195
things are so bad at school.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.936
He's not telling me, but I know.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.934
Yesterday, he cry.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.806
Have you talked to the teachers?

19:01.831 --> 19:04.801
Yes. They say he need talk to them.

19:04.826 --> 19:07.012
But he no talk to them.

19:08.559 --> 19:10.950
Alexei say it will get better.

19:11.278 --> 19:14.147
No. It not get better.

19:14.172 --> 19:16.075
It get worse.

19:17.919 --> 19:20.652
You know, it's so hard raising boys,

19:20.677 --> 19:23.537
especially when you're somewhere new.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.347
And they need their fathers.

19:25.349 --> 19:27.749
But the fathers... don't
always know what's right.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.081
They think they do,

19:29.086 --> 19:32.816
but sometimes we have to
tell them what our boys need.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.992
I tell him. I beg him.

19:35.993 --> 19:38.393
I say this place no good for Pasha.

19:38.395 --> 19:40.263
This life no good.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.497
But Alexei don't hear.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.448
When Brad gets like that... I don't cry.

19:46.473 --> 19:48.203
- I don't beg.
- (Sniffles)

19:48.205 --> 19:49.905
I tell him how it's going to be.

19:49.907 --> 19:51.737
And he knows, if he doesn't listen,

19:51.742 --> 19:53.942
there's gonna be trouble.
Because you know what?

19:53.944 --> 19:57.630
Ninety-nine percent of the
time, he does get his way.

19:58.380 --> 20:01.950
Alexei try to listen, but...

20:02.352 --> 20:05.137
he has to be right. To come here.

20:06.390 --> 20:09.536
So he don't believe in anything else.

20:10.231 --> 20:12.942
Say Pashenka must learn.

20:14.177 --> 20:16.302
(Crying) Nothing I can do.

20:23.579 --> 20:26.779
I go see if Pasha need...

20:39.871 --> 20:41.693
Hello?

20:41.718 --> 20:43.648
Tuan: In here!

20:49.795 --> 20:51.594
This country...

20:53.903 --> 20:55.735
I know.

20:58.095 --> 21:00.225
Some kids kicked Pasha's ass today.

21:00.250 --> 21:04.575
I heard. Did you see him?
With his big black eye?

21:06.115 --> 21:10.294
When this is all over, I gotta
teach that kid how to fight.

21:11.954 --> 21:14.294
If my son came home like
that, I'd do something.

21:14.295 --> 21:17.059
But Evgheniya...

21:20.129 --> 21:22.359
Alexei's not going to take him back home

21:22.366 --> 21:25.126
and Evgheniya can't change his mind.

21:25.135 --> 21:28.600
And it doesn't look like she's
going back without her husband.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.040
Okay.

21:32.042 --> 21:34.285
We need to rethink this.

21:43.686 --> 21:45.259
You have kids?

21:50.960 --> 21:52.557
Yeah.

21:52.582 --> 21:54.509
How's that?

21:56.699 --> 21:58.729
It's good.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.345
I mean...

22:01.171 --> 22:04.525
It's hard with this job, but...

22:05.814 --> 22:07.603
it's good.

22:14.991 --> 22:17.166
We'll figure out Pasha.

22:17.191 --> 22:19.185
We can get them there.

22:27.410 --> 22:28.729
It honestly sounded like

22:28.732 --> 22:31.056
the class we had on dangles at Quantico.

22:31.081 --> 22:32.588
Half the shit he said.

22:32.613 --> 22:34.385
You don't think they've raised
their game in the twenty years

22:34.410 --> 22:35.932
since those scripts were written?

22:35.957 --> 22:38.157
Maybe, maybe not.

22:38.159 --> 22:39.693
What about her?

22:39.694 --> 22:40.894
If she's a part of this,

22:40.919 --> 22:43.707
she's the best long-game
player I've ever seen.

22:43.732 --> 22:47.699
Honestly, we're worried about her.

22:47.724 --> 22:51.316
If she's already blown,
and they're using her...

22:51.371 --> 22:54.203
- My god...
- Slow down. Take a breath.

22:55.217 --> 22:58.625
We don't know anything. Just
like every other operation.

22:58.650 --> 23:00.427
You've done it before.

23:00.452 --> 23:03.366
The plan all along was to go
way outside the Rezidentura

23:03.391 --> 23:05.154
and see if we get something.

23:05.155 --> 23:07.539
Maybe it's working, maybe it's not.

23:07.564 --> 23:09.334
We'll find out.

24:58.832 --> 25:00.952
(Laughs)

25:00.977 --> 25:02.362
A compass.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.340
Wouldn't want you getting lost again.

25:04.341 --> 25:05.710
Thanks.

25:06.835 --> 25:08.389
It's great.

25:09.739 --> 25:12.669
You've meant a lot to our family...

25:16.724 --> 25:18.805
It's been quite a road.

25:19.494 --> 25:21.562
Um, before you go...

25:21.563 --> 25:23.731
I'm not leaving just yet.

25:23.732 --> 25:25.766
I know. Um...

25:26.668 --> 25:30.303
but we wanted to get your
advice on a family thing.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.735
Do you think that...

25:32.760 --> 25:36.195
we could ever take Paige and Henry...

25:36.912 --> 25:40.219
back... home?

25:42.091 --> 25:43.421
To...

25:46.805 --> 25:48.626
(Chuckles softly)

25:48.651 --> 25:50.344
To live.

25:52.144 --> 25:55.180
Is this something you want to do?

25:57.064 --> 25:58.464
We're thinking about it.

25:58.467 --> 26:00.634
We don't know if...

26:01.195 --> 26:03.515
they would ever really
adjust to life there...

26:03.540 --> 26:07.367
But with the situation
here, and everything...

26:07.392 --> 26:08.575
most of which you know about,

26:08.577 --> 26:11.487
and, really, everything
that goes along with it...

26:11.488 --> 26:15.980
um, it's not much better either...

26:18.219 --> 26:20.302
Does Henry know anything?

26:26.160 --> 26:28.052
(Sighs)

26:28.824 --> 26:31.387
I think you'll have trouble either way.

26:33.434 --> 26:37.634
It's hard to imagine all the
problems that two American kids

26:37.639 --> 26:39.763
will have adjusting to life over there.

26:39.788 --> 26:42.669
But there's a lot about life
here that's not so great...

26:45.479 --> 26:49.109
You can't predict what
a person's life will be.

26:49.117 --> 26:53.683
And you can't deny them the
challenges that will shape them.

26:57.591 --> 26:59.970
Does Paige know you're
thinking about this?

26:59.995 --> 27:01.885
- Not yet.
- No.

27:02.431 --> 27:04.964
We will talk to her soon.

27:05.779 --> 27:08.651
We're just...

27:11.339 --> 27:14.499
The temptation is to put
off making hard decisions,

27:14.509 --> 27:18.721
but then that becomes
its own sort of decision.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.054
Paige and Henry are teenagers.

27:22.055 --> 27:25.619
At this age, the transition

27:25.620 --> 27:29.338
would be a very
difficult one for them...

27:30.625 --> 27:32.059
but in a few years,

27:32.060 --> 27:34.650
it won't be your
decision to make anymore.

27:40.501 --> 27:43.471
I wish I could tell
you what you should do,

27:43.472 --> 27:45.560
but I don't know.

27:55.647 --> 27:57.280
(Door opens)

27:57.616 --> 27:59.784
Surprise!

28:01.050 --> 28:02.561
What's this?

28:02.586 --> 28:05.396
Well, I made you dinner.

28:05.983 --> 28:07.467
You? Made dinner?

28:07.492 --> 28:09.584
- Well, we. Chris helped me.
- Hi.

28:09.608 --> 28:10.614
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:10.639 --> 28:13.270
So, we have meatloaf. Pasta salad.

28:13.295 --> 28:15.635
Mashed potatoes and gravy and asparagus.

28:15.636 --> 28:18.202
- You hate asparagus.
- Yeah, but you like it.

28:18.203 --> 28:20.800
(Both chuckle)

28:20.803 --> 28:23.264
Oh. Sorry. We didn't
have a chance to clean up.

28:23.289 --> 28:25.756
I'm... I'm gonna clean
everything. Don't worry.

28:25.806 --> 28:26.906
What prompted this?

28:26.907 --> 28:29.247
Well, you saying I
can go to St. Edwards.

28:29.248 --> 28:31.872
- If I get in.
- You'll get in.

28:32.818 --> 28:36.106
Look. I know this was all kind
of a surprise for you guys.

28:36.131 --> 28:40.478
But you've been really
cool about it, and...

28:40.503 --> 28:42.137
Thank you.

28:42.162 --> 28:45.176
Chris: It's a great school.
Henry's gonna love it.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.763
Paige: Is the feast ready yet?

28:46.788 --> 28:48.823
It looks delicious.

28:48.824 --> 28:51.295
- So, let's eat.
- Oh, I can't stay.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.893
My dad's on his way to pick me up.

28:52.894 --> 28:54.576
We're having dinner at my
grandma's house tonight.

28:54.601 --> 28:56.171
Oh.

29:01.502 --> 29:03.320
Paige: I had nothing to do with this.

29:03.345 --> 29:06.242
I offered to help, and he
wouldn't let me near it.

29:07.258 --> 29:09.375
It's so great that
you're letting him go.

29:11.262 --> 29:12.495
What?

29:12.498 --> 29:14.128
(Henry and Chris conversing)

29:14.132 --> 29:16.823
Nothing. Everything's fine.

29:16.848 --> 29:19.247
Good night, Mr. and Mrs.
Jennings. I hope you enjoy it.

29:19.272 --> 29:21.280
I'm sure we will.

29:21.305 --> 29:24.275
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah. I'll call you later.

29:31.649 --> 29:34.652
(Machinery rumbling, steam hissing)

29:34.653 --> 29:36.613
(Indistinct shouting in distance)

30:46.305 --> 30:49.860
Hey. Henry got a ride
to school with Chris.

30:49.861 --> 30:51.398
Is she his girlfriend?

30:51.423 --> 30:53.063
She's definitely something.

30:55.199 --> 30:57.139
I slept through the night yesterday

30:57.140 --> 31:00.414
for the first time in like... forever.

31:00.439 --> 31:02.782
- That's great.
- Philip: Yeah.

31:04.475 --> 31:07.188
I'm glad about Pastor Tim.

31:07.745 --> 31:09.145
That I won't have to hang out with them

31:09.147 --> 31:12.047
at the church all the time and...

31:12.050 --> 31:14.616
That sounds mean. But
I just... I keep...

31:14.641 --> 31:18.288
picturing him gone, and... it's better.

31:18.290 --> 31:19.990
Philip: Yeah.

31:23.553 --> 31:26.564
It's amazing that you could do that.

31:28.432 --> 31:32.332
Sometimes you want to
be able to do things.

31:33.304 --> 31:37.134
We'd never do anything like
that lightly. Obviously.

31:45.349 --> 31:47.574
Where did our name come from?

31:48.953 --> 31:50.691
Paige: Jennings.

31:50.716 --> 31:54.101
Um, well, before we got here,

31:54.126 --> 31:56.356
our people worked it out.

32:01.964 --> 32:05.302
What happens in these
cases is you need a new name

32:05.303 --> 32:07.163
to fit in, where you're going.

32:07.172 --> 32:11.736
So they look for the
name of someone who died.

32:11.761 --> 32:14.745
They're... they're not using it anymore.

32:15.614 --> 32:19.753
So... that's where it comes from.

32:23.020 --> 32:27.992
Philip and Elizabeth
Jennings are dead people?

32:27.993 --> 32:31.323
Well, Philip Jennings is. Was.

32:31.329 --> 32:34.948
And Elizabeth Korman, who married him.

32:36.534 --> 32:38.164
Do you know anything about them?

32:38.170 --> 32:39.659
Who they were?

32:41.659 --> 32:45.878
Uh, when they were born.
Where they're from. Same as us.

32:47.912 --> 32:50.842
So... do you feel like

32:50.849 --> 32:54.847
those names are your real names now?

32:56.457 --> 32:58.065
Yes.

32:58.824 --> 33:00.354
Yeah.

33:01.948 --> 33:04.923
But I miss my old name, too.
