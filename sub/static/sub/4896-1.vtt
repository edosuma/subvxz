<i>You know, there's nothing like the experience...</i>

00:43.323 --> 00:46.258
<i>of raising your first dog.</i>

00:46.326 --> 00:50.422
<i>Simplejoy of walking side by side
with your buddy out in the fresh air...</i>

00:50.497 --> 00:52.522
<i>throwin'a stick.</i>

00:52.599 --> 00:56.228
<i>Spending some quiet time-
just you and your very best friend.</i>

01:02.709 --> 01:05.610
<i>Of course, that wasn't my experience.</i>

01:05.679 --> 01:08.204
<i>That kid's not even me.</i>

01:12.386 --> 01:16.117
<i>That's me, and that crazy hound
I'm chasing is Marley...</i>

01:16.189 --> 01:19.352
<i>- the world's worst dog-
- Sorry!</i>

01:19.426 --> 01:21.360
<i>- Or so I thought.
- Marley!</i>

01:21.428 --> 01:23.794
<i>But our story begins
before Marley was born-</i>

01:23.864 --> 01:26.765
<i>Four years before,
on my wedding day-</i>

01:26.833 --> 01:29.961
<i>which also happened to be the day
of the worst freak spring blizzard...</i>

01:30.036 --> 01:31.970
<i>in the history of southern Michigan.</i>

01:32.038 --> 01:35.303
<i>Same day our car broke down.
We didn't care.</i>

01:35.375 --> 01:37.741
Ooh. God, that feels so good.

01:39.346 --> 01:41.439
Ohh!

01:41.515 --> 01:43.449
Wow. So, what do you think-

01:43.517 --> 01:45.951
What do you think that means-
a blizzard on your wedding day?

01:46.019 --> 01:48.214
Is that good luck?
Is that bad luck?

01:48.288 --> 01:50.688
I think- I think it's good luck.

01:52.993 --> 01:55.655
- How did I get you?
- What?

01:55.729 --> 01:59.324
No, honestly. How did I-
How did I get that lucky?

01:59.399 --> 02:01.993
Well, you know...

02:02.068 --> 02:04.195
I get asked that question all the time.

02:04.271 --> 02:07.138
Come on.

02:07.207 --> 02:09.835
Are you kidding, honey?

02:09.910 --> 02:11.844
You're part of the plan.

02:11.912 --> 02:15.541
- The plan?
- Mm-hmm. My plan. Step one-

02:15.615 --> 02:20.985
Meet an incredibly sweet,
smart, sexy man.

02:21.054 --> 02:23.488
Done. Step two?

02:23.557 --> 02:25.991
Marry you instead.

02:26.059 --> 02:29.119
Oh, now-And step three-

02:29.196 --> 02:32.029
- No, I don't think I can take any more steps.
- You don't wanna hear step three?

02:32.098 --> 02:34.032
- Yeah. What's step three?
- It's easy.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.069
- Be gentle.
- Move someplace warmer.

02:37.137 --> 02:39.002
I knew you were gonna say that.

03:02.829 --> 03:06.731
<i>Shiny, happy people laughing</i>

03:10.804 --> 03:14.535
<i>Meet me in the crowd</i>

03:14.608 --> 03:18.442
<i>People, people</i>

03:18.512 --> 03:21.709
<i>Throw your love around</i>

03:21.781 --> 03:26.115
<i>Love me, love me</i>

03:26.186 --> 03:29.747
<i>Take it into town</i>

03:29.823 --> 03:33.657
<i>Happy, happy</i>

03:33.727 --> 03:36.753
<i>Put it in the ground</i>

03:36.830 --> 03:41.665
<i>Where the flowers grow</i>

03:43.570 --> 03:48.940
<i>Gold and silver shine</i>

03:52.913 --> 03:56.679
<i>Shiny, happy people
holding hands</i>

03:56.750 --> 03:59.878
<i>Shiny, happy people</i>

03:59.953 --> 04:02.786
- Thank you.
- All right, you know you got this, right?

04:02.856 --> 04:06.451
- Oh, yeah. I got it.
- Who are you?

04:06.526 --> 04:09.393
- I'm John Grogan?
- No, you'reJohn friggin' Grogan...

04:09.462 --> 04:11.430
who's about to get
a job as a reporter...

04:11.498 --> 04:14.956
for a major metropolitan newspaper.

04:15.035 --> 04:18.027
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Good. Good. But now I don't feel like getting out of the car.

04:18.103 --> 04:20.298
- You have to. No, baby.
- Maybe we'll just drive around the block.

04:20.373 --> 04:22.739
Come on, get out of the car. Get out.

04:24.744 --> 04:27.975
- Now, who am I again?
- Oh, please.

04:28.048 --> 04:31.176
<i>Sebastian says you won some kind of award.</i>

04:31.251 --> 04:34.186
Mitchie. I have a Mitchie.

04:34.254 --> 04:37.155
It's like a Pulitzer,
but from western Michigan.

04:37.223 --> 04:39.885
A Mitchie.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.485
So, tell me-What made you
leave the estimable...

04:42.562 --> 04:45.122
Kalamazoo Gazette?

04:45.198 --> 04:48.531
Well, as you know, Sebastian
and I were in college together...

04:48.602 --> 04:51.469
And he w- He was-

04:51.538 --> 04:54.006
He was always saying
how great south Florida is...

04:54.074 --> 04:58.511
and that maybe my wife and I might enjoy it
here, so we decided to come down here.

04:58.578 --> 05:01.206
- Are you a comedian too?
- Excuse me?

05:01.281 --> 05:03.715
Like your friend over here.

05:03.783 --> 05:07.048
- No.
- He's walking a very thin line.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.281
It's a good thing he knows how to write.

05:09.356 --> 05:11.950
So your wife is Jenny Havens?

05:12.025 --> 05:15.791
Yes. Jenny Grogan-
'Cause we're married. She took my name.

05:15.862 --> 05:18.956
<i>- She get the job at the Post?
- Yes, she did.</i>

05:19.032 --> 05:22.001
<i>- Why didn't they want you over there?
- Well, I didn't apply.</i>

05:22.068 --> 05:24.002
<i>Jenny's more of a feature writer...</i>

05:24.070 --> 05:26.004
and I'm more of
a straight news writer.

05:26.072 --> 05:28.563
- I thought this would be a better fit for that.
- You think you're better...

05:28.642 --> 05:32.544
than the six journalism school graduates
that came here looking for work this morning?

05:32.612 --> 05:34.546
I don't know if I'm better. L-

05:34.614 --> 05:37.674
What I do know is that I have
a tendency to surprise myself.

05:37.751 --> 05:41.278
Ten years ago I was doing bong hits
and playing Donkey Kong.

05:41.354 --> 05:44.016
I never dreamed
I'd get into college, but I did...

05:44.090 --> 05:46.888
<i>and I graduated with honors.</i>

05:46.960 --> 05:49.690
And I never thought I'd get a job
at a real newspaper, but I did.

05:49.763 --> 05:51.731
<i>And I certainly never thought
I'd get a girl...</i>

05:51.798 --> 05:54.323
<i>likeJenny Havens
to marry me, but I did.</i>

05:58.138 --> 06:01.437
- So?
- They've already got a guy on the metro desk.

06:01.508 --> 06:03.442
Yeah.

06:03.510 --> 06:05.944
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Mmm. So they're putting me on a little thing...

06:06.012 --> 06:08.742
they like to call Desert Storm.

06:08.815 --> 06:10.908
- You got the job?
- I got the job.

06:10.984 --> 06:13.282
You got the job, baby! Ooh!

06:13.353 --> 06:15.184
<i>John Grogan, I knew it!</i>

06:15.255 --> 06:17.689
I just knew it! Okay, Look.

06:17.757 --> 06:19.918
Watch this. Look.
See what happens?

06:19.993 --> 06:21.927
"Job. Done. "

06:21.995 --> 06:24.463
- Okay, so what's next? Lunch?
- House.

06:24.531 --> 06:25.964
- House.
- House.

06:45.719 --> 06:48.483
<i>...planes that can
transmit remote television pictures...</i>

06:48.555 --> 06:51.023
<i>of Iraqi ships and other targets.</i>

06:51.091 --> 06:54.583
Did- Did you get to the quote
about the speed bumps yet?

06:54.661 --> 06:58.028
- "'Lf they save even one life"'-
- "'... it would be worth it. '

06:58.098 --> 07:01.431
And with that, Jan Dickerson's eyes
filled with tears. "

07:01.501 --> 07:03.435
- Filled with tears.
- You like that?

07:03.503 --> 07:05.437
- Or is it too corny?
- Yeah. No.

07:05.505 --> 07:08.565
Is it a little over the top?

07:08.641 --> 07:11.439
Hey, honey, what happened
to the, uh- the Desert Storm piece?

07:11.511 --> 07:15.277
<i>- That's it. The injured girl's dad's in Kuwait.
- Oh.</i>

07:15.348 --> 07:17.282
- Is that not in there?
- Uh-

07:17.350 --> 07:19.978
Uh-uh. I think they cut that.

07:20.053 --> 07:22.487
They-They spelled your name wrong.

07:22.555 --> 07:26.150
- "John Gorgon. "
- You're kidding. Let me see that.

07:26.226 --> 07:27.488
- Forget it.
- Are you joking?

07:27.560 --> 07:29.585
Forget it. You know what?
It's good. It's really good.

07:29.662 --> 07:31.823
It's got the facts.
It's got color.

07:31.898 --> 07:33.991
- It's a really solid piece.
- Thanks.

07:34.067 --> 07:37.730
Well, I mean, I tried to breathe
some life into it, you know-

07:37.804 --> 07:41.672
- Yes.
- I like this article. I'm almost done with yours.

07:41.741 --> 07:44.608
This idea of voting machines
sounds really efficient.

07:44.677 --> 07:46.702
Well, when you get
to the next page, you'll see...

07:46.780 --> 07:50.682
<i>- that I talk about what could happen.
- Hey, it- Oh, okay. I see.</i>

07:50.750 --> 07:53.514
<i>- It continues.
- Yeah.</i>

07:55.522 --> 07:57.456
But actually, the rest of it...

07:57.524 --> 07:59.458
is really just okay.

07:59.526 --> 08:01.756
- It's actually kind of boring.
- No, no. L- It's-

08:01.828 --> 08:03.819
- I'm enjoying this.
- Mmm.

08:05.098 --> 08:08.829
Wow. They really gave you
a lot of space.

08:11.738 --> 08:14.730
Oh, damn. Killed another one.

08:14.808 --> 08:19.040
How am I ever supposed to take care of
a kid if I can't even keep a plant alive?

08:19.112 --> 08:21.706
<i>Well, what'd you expect, man?</i>

08:21.781 --> 08:24.443
You bought a house-
A house with a spare room.

08:24.517 --> 08:26.451
What's the matter with a spare room?

08:26.519 --> 08:29.545
It's empty, John, that's what's wrong
with it. You know what else is empty?

08:29.622 --> 08:31.556
Her womb.

08:31.624 --> 08:33.854
- I'm just worried thatJenny's at, like, step seven.
- What?

08:33.927 --> 08:36.725
She's got her whole life
organized and planned out...

08:36.796 --> 08:38.821
- according to these steps.
- Okay, that's scary.

08:38.898 --> 08:42.765
Unbelievable.
You want my advice? Get her, like, a bird.

08:42.836 --> 08:44.770
Or a puppy or something.

08:44.838 --> 08:48.069
- A parakeet or something?
- Something other than you that she has to take care of.

08:48.141 --> 08:50.871
You got a kid, you're a dad.
You're not you anymore.

08:50.944 --> 08:53.936
- You got a dog, you're a-
- Master.

08:54.013 --> 08:55.947
- You're still a guy.
- Still got a life.

08:56.015 --> 08:58.142
- Exactly.
- And a dog.

08:58.218 --> 09:00.709
Yeah, but you've stopped
her clock for a few years.

09:00.787 --> 09:03.449
- I've never had a dog.
- There's nothin' to it. You feed 'em.

09:03.523 --> 09:05.548
You walk 'em. You let 'em out
every now and again.

09:05.625 --> 09:09.083
But it doesn't really matter. You're not
the one that's gonna take care of it, Jenny is.

09:09.162 --> 09:10.891
<i>- Sebastian!
- Yo.</i>

09:10.964 --> 09:13.023
Your travel's been approved.
Hit the road.

09:13.099 --> 09:15.727
<i>- Where you goin'?
- I'm going to Colombia.</i>

09:15.802 --> 09:20.171
I got a guy down there says he can
put me next to Pablo Escobar.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.174
I'm doin' a piece-

09:22.242 --> 09:25.803
I follow a single coca leaf from
the jungle to the streets of Miami.

09:25.879 --> 09:28.746
That sounds like a good idea.
You gotta be careful down there-

09:28.815 --> 09:31.784
- Gorman!
- G-Grogan.

09:31.851 --> 09:34.615
Groden. There's a fire
in the county dump-

09:34.687 --> 09:36.985
<i>- Methane leak.
- Methane?</i>

09:37.056 --> 09:39.149
Yeah. I want two paragraphs
for the Blotter.

09:41.794 --> 09:45.560
Methane. Woodward
and Bernstein, eat your heart out.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.760
What kind of dog?

09:49.836 --> 09:52.498
- You remember Caroline?
- The nurse?

09:52.572 --> 09:54.699
She was a nursery school teacher.
I don't know.

09:54.774 --> 09:58.266
Anyway, she had
this great dog- Daisy.

09:58.344 --> 10:00.335
It was a Labradoodle.

10:00.413 --> 10:03.780
Labradoodle? You mean a Labrador.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.977
All right. Get her a Labrador.

10:06.052 --> 10:08.680
<i>Supposed to bejust like kids,
only easier to train.</i>

10:09.889 --> 10:12.915
Labradoodle? Come on.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.434
This does not smell like an I HOP.

10:22.502 --> 10:24.970
I know. We got a little surprise first.

10:25.038 --> 10:29.236
- Here we go. Now, I want you to walk right here, my dear.
- Okay.

10:29.309 --> 10:31.539
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

10:31.611 --> 10:33.545
Okay.

10:33.613 --> 10:35.604
- You Grogan?
- Yes.

10:35.682 --> 10:37.946
- Expected you an hour ago.
- You're gonna like this.

10:38.017 --> 10:40.212
<i>Okay, step up. Sorry.</i>

10:40.286 --> 10:42.220
Sorry about the mess-

10:42.288 --> 10:46.054
- And the noise and the smell.
- What's happening?

10:46.125 --> 10:48.525
Come on.

10:48.594 --> 10:50.528
- Can I look?
- No, no. Just-Almost. Almost.

10:50.596 --> 10:52.587
- Okay. Okay. Ready?
- Really?

10:52.665 --> 10:56.499
One, two, three. Go.
Happy birthday.

10:56.569 --> 10:58.560
<i>What?</i>

10:58.638 --> 11:00.572
God, they're adorable.

11:02.241 --> 11:04.573
Oh, my- My birthday's
not for a month.

11:04.644 --> 11:07.204
<i>That's okay. They can't leave
for three weeks anyway.</i>

11:09.282 --> 11:13.048
- We didn't discuss this.
- I know, but it's a surprise. You can't.

11:13.119 --> 11:15.952
<i>- Hi, guys.
- Just adopted the mom last month.</i>

11:16.022 --> 11:19.355
Family that gave her up didn't
even know she was pregnant.

11:19.425 --> 11:22.826
<i>- Are you sure we're ready for this?
- Well, like I told you...</i>

11:22.895 --> 11:25.420
you gotta wait three weeks for them to
be weaned before you can bring 'em home.

11:25.498 --> 11:27.227
- I'm not even gonna be here.
- Why?

11:27.300 --> 11:30.098
- I'll be in Gainesville, covering that trial.
- Oh, that's right.

11:30.169 --> 11:32.137
That's okay. It'll give me
a chance to bond with him...

11:32.205 --> 11:33.934
- and get a head start on training 'im-
- That's true.

11:34.007 --> 11:37.340
- Get 'im squared away before you get home.
- That's true.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.776
<i>- Well, how are we gonna pick one?
- Girls are 300.</i>

11:39.846 --> 11:42.747
Boys are 275.

11:42.815 --> 11:47.013
Except for that little guy there.
Him you could have for 200 even.

11:47.086 --> 11:51.284
This one? You're so sweet.
You're like a little clearance puppy.

11:51.357 --> 11:53.757
- Hello, puppy.
- This one likes you.

11:53.826 --> 11:56.192
Clearance Puppy likes you.

11:56.262 --> 11:59.425
<i>- Well, that's your guy.
- Aw.</i>

11:59.499 --> 12:01.433
I was gonna pick you anyway.

12:01.501 --> 12:03.765
Don't tell anybody.
Don't tell the others.

12:07.073 --> 12:11.339
<i>We gotta double-time itjust a little here, honey.</i>

12:11.411 --> 12:13.641
- Really wish I didn't have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

12:13.713 --> 12:15.977
It's gonna be great.
You spent eight months on this trial.

12:16.049 --> 12:17.983
- Honestly, I'm jealous.
- Really?

12:18.051 --> 12:19.985
Tax evasion? That's what
makes you jealous?

12:20.053 --> 12:22.112
Well, it's sexier than speed bumps.

12:22.188 --> 12:24.622
- Okay, you call me the minute you get him home.
- Okay. Okay.

12:24.690 --> 12:28.217
- We also have to come up with a name for him.
- Yes. Let's brainstorm it.

12:28.294 --> 12:30.819
I'll just call him Clearance Puppy
till you get back.

12:30.897 --> 12:33.695
- Are you gonna be okay?
- You're worried about me with a puppy?

12:33.766 --> 12:34.994
<i>- I am.
- Me, John friggin' Grogan?</i>

12:35.068 --> 12:37.400
- I know.
- Good-bye. I love you. You look pretty.

12:37.470 --> 12:39.131
- Thank you. I love you. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

12:44.911 --> 12:47.209
How ya doin' there, buddy?

12:47.280 --> 12:49.840
Kind of a big day for you.

12:50.917 --> 12:53.613
Let's listen to the radio.

12:53.686 --> 12:56.120
Awkward silences.

12:56.189 --> 13:00.023
- One love
- You like that? You like Bob Marley?

13:00.093 --> 13:04.154
<i>- Let's get together and
- Bob. That be a good name?</i>

13:04.230 --> 13:08.166
<i>- Feel all right
- Bob. Bob. Come here, Bob. Or Robert?</i>

13:08.234 --> 13:10.498
When you got older.
More dignified.

13:10.570 --> 13:12.697
<i>- The children cryin'
- Marley?</i>

13:12.772 --> 13:14.763
<i>- Sayin'give thanks and praise
- You like that.</i>

13:14.841 --> 13:16.536
That has a nice ring to it.

13:16.609 --> 13:18.804
<i>- Feel all right
- Okay. Whoa.</i>

13:18.878 --> 13:21.142
It's better if you ride shotgun.

13:21.214 --> 13:24.308
<i>- Because we don't wanna have a car crash-
- And feel all right</i>

13:24.383 --> 13:26.715
our first real day together.

13:26.786 --> 13:29.220
<i>Let them all pass all their</i>

13:29.288 --> 13:31.222
<i>Dirty remarks</i>

13:31.290 --> 13:34.282
<i>- Okay, come here. Come here.
- There is one question</i>

13:34.360 --> 13:37.158
It's a big day. You can ride over here.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.664
<i>Maybe it's okay today.
Just this one time.</i>

13:42.602 --> 13:44.900
<i>We get pulled over, we explain-</i>

13:44.971 --> 13:47.872
We explain what
the circumstances are.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.170
<i>To save his own beliefs</i>

13:51.310 --> 13:53.244
<i>One love-</i>

13:55.615 --> 13:58.482
- What happened?
- The Millers got robbed.

13:58.551 --> 14:01.918
Again? Good thing I got a watchdog.

14:01.988 --> 14:04.149
Hey, buddy. He's got some teeth.

14:04.223 --> 14:06.157
Oh, yeah.

14:06.225 --> 14:08.159
I'll get him some water.

14:08.227 --> 14:10.388
You're not gonna keep him
in the backyard, are you?

14:10.463 --> 14:13.364
I'm gonna keep him in the garage
till I get him house trained.

14:13.432 --> 14:17.232
- Hmm.
- No, Marley, Marley, Marley. No, no.

14:18.571 --> 14:20.436
No, no, no, no.

14:20.506 --> 14:23.498
<i>You've had enough food, Marley.
You've had two bowls ofkibble.</i>

14:23.576 --> 14:27.307
You had half a seat belt in the car.

14:28.881 --> 14:33.341
Huh. H-How are you still eating?

14:36.489 --> 14:39.458
<i>I don't understand where
you can put it.</i>

14:39.525 --> 14:44.019
Here's the little box where
Marley's gonna bunk down.

14:44.096 --> 14:46.030
Pretty cozy.

14:46.098 --> 14:49.465
<i>All right. Good night.</i>

14:51.671 --> 14:53.764
You're gonna be okay.

14:53.839 --> 14:55.807
I'm just right inside.

14:56.809 --> 14:58.743
Sleep tight.

15:26.672 --> 15:29.106
<i>All right.</i>

15:30.876 --> 15:32.810
Come on, Marley.

15:32.878 --> 15:35.210
You're killin' me, you know that?

15:50.997 --> 15:54.956
Oh, we got some cleanin' up
to do before the missus gets back.

15:56.669 --> 15:57.465
All right.

15:57.536 --> 15:59.561
I'm off to the airport...

15:59.639 --> 16:03.200
and you're gonna ride out
the rain right in your little box.

16:05.845 --> 16:09.372
It's just a little thunder.
Back in a flash.

16:35.675 --> 16:38.235
<i>- Get in. Here.
- Oh, my God!</i>

16:38.311 --> 16:41.542
- Oh!
- Aaah.

16:41.614 --> 16:43.673
- Hi.
- How are you?

16:43.749 --> 16:45.683
- How's my puppy?
- I'm okay.

16:45.751 --> 16:48.845
A little tired, but trying to stay dry.

16:48.921 --> 16:51.754
- No, really. How is he?
- Waiting for you.

17:05.070 --> 17:09.007
Do you hear that?
Is that- I think that's Marley.

17:16.682 --> 17:18.547
Oh, my God.

17:18.617 --> 17:20.517
Oh, my God. Look at this!

17:20.586 --> 17:23.180
<i>This is not how I left it.</i>

17:23.255 --> 17:25.348
<i>- How long did you leave him?
- I left him for maybe an hour.</i>

17:25.424 --> 17:27.517
Tops. Did he eat the drywall?

17:29.028 --> 17:31.121
- Oh, that's not right.
- Wow.

17:31.197 --> 17:33.358
That's one little dog did that.

17:33.432 --> 17:36.094
Oh, honey, you're shaking.

17:36.168 --> 17:39.535
Does thunder scare you, mister?

17:39.605 --> 17:42.369
<i>Oh, ho. Sweet boy.</i>

17:42.441 --> 17:44.773
Oh, look at us.

17:46.946 --> 17:50.438
So I'm in this cave and-
and I can feel the machine guns.

17:50.516 --> 17:52.416
There's, like, nine of them around me.

17:52.485 --> 17:55.079
<i>- What, like AK-47 s?
- Kalashnikov.</i>

17:55.154 --> 17:57.384
- And then Escobar comes in and says-
- Escobar?

17:57.456 --> 18:02.052
El Padrino-Yeah. He says,
"I read your piece on Gadhafi...

18:02.128 --> 18:05.325
and I think you captured
his narcissism perfectly. "

18:06.399 --> 18:09.061
<i>- Can you believe that?
- Some of it.</i>

18:09.135 --> 18:11.000
Man, I wish you
could have been there.

18:11.070 --> 18:14.767
But then who's gonna cover the power
struggle down at the Rotary Club in Delray?

18:14.840 --> 18:17.240
Oh, it's been just crazy.

18:17.309 --> 18:21.006
- Your time will come, amigo.
- I'll drink to that.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.981
That was crazy. Oh, my God.

18:24.049 --> 18:26.643
- Oh, my God!
- That is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

18:26.719 --> 18:28.744
<i>- Hey.
- Say hello, Marley.</i>

18:28.821 --> 18:30.311
- Hey, little Marley.
- Can I hold him?

18:30.389 --> 18:31.822
Of course. Here you go.

18:31.891 --> 18:33.984
<i>- He's so cute.
- Oh, I love their puppy breath.</i>

18:34.059 --> 18:38.189
Oh. Have you guys met my buddy Sebastian?

18:38.264 --> 18:40.425
Sebastian. Viviana.
Nice to meet you.

18:40.499 --> 18:42.990
- Hi. I'm Shannon.
- Hey, he's a beauty, isn't he?

18:43.068 --> 18:47.164
<i>- He's adorable.
- I think the "puppy instead of a baby" idea is working.</i>

18:47.239 --> 18:50.436
- Yeah, it's certainly working for me.
- Can I take him home with me?

18:50.509 --> 18:52.340
You're so cute. Yes, you are.

18:52.411 --> 18:56.006
I can't let you have the puppy, but
you might have a shot with the big dog.

18:56.081 --> 18:58.049
- I'm easy.
- Oh, you're easy.

18:58.117 --> 19:00.017
<i>And I do tricks.
I'm paper trained.</i>

19:04.256 --> 19:06.281
Marley! Marley!

19:06.358 --> 19:09.327
<i>- Come back, puppy.
- Marley! Marley!</i>

19:16.569 --> 19:18.537
Marley!

19:18.604 --> 19:21.129
Marley. Marley!

19:27.279 --> 19:30.373
- Marley!
- Puppy!

19:37.756 --> 19:39.986
- Got him. Thanks.
- You have got to be more careful, man.

19:40.059 --> 19:43.927
It's our first week together,
so we're still working out the kinks.

19:43.996 --> 19:47.090
You really shouldn't bring a dog
down to the dog beach until he's trained.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.929
Okay, can I get the dog back?

19:49.001 --> 19:51.731
Never let him off leash
unless you have complete confidence.

19:51.804 --> 19:53.635
- Okay.
- This is the only beach in two counties...

19:53.706 --> 19:55.537
- where dogs aren't banned.
- All right.

19:55.608 --> 19:58.668
Cops see anybody peeing or pooping
down by the water, they'll shut us down.

19:58.744 --> 20:02.111
Why is that funny to you?

20:03.182 --> 20:05.446
I'm just very immature.

20:05.518 --> 20:07.611
Calvin!

20:09.922 --> 20:12.015
See? Aren't you glad
you're not Calvin?

20:12.091 --> 20:14.457
See how easy you got it?

20:17.663 --> 20:19.631
<i>Marley, stop!</i>

20:19.698 --> 20:22.132
<i>Marley. Marley.</i>

20:22.201 --> 20:24.726
Honey, the dog's got my-

20:24.803 --> 20:27.533
<i>Marley, no.</i>

20:27.606 --> 20:29.597
Marley, you can't go
through a screen door.

20:33.345 --> 20:36.178
<i>We're rockin'the suburbs</i>

20:36.248 --> 20:39.081
<i>Around the block
just one more time</i>

20:39.151 --> 20:41.483
<i>We're rockin'the suburbs</i>

20:41.554 --> 20:44.318
<i>- We part the shades and face some facts
- Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

20:44.390 --> 20:45.721
<i>- You too.
- They got better looking fescue</i>

20:45.791 --> 20:48.385
Marley!

20:49.628 --> 20:52.119
It just seems like
that there's other guys.

20:52.197 --> 20:55.564
- Like, I don't understand why you thought of me.
- I'm in a bind.

20:55.634 --> 20:57.465
Yeah, but I'm a reporter.
I'm not a columnist.

20:57.536 --> 20:59.766
<i>John, you get better pay...</i>

20:59.838 --> 21:02.898
you can pick your own hours
and choose your own topics.

21:02.975 --> 21:05.739
<i>- Why are you hesitating?
- No, I'm thinking.</i>

21:05.811 --> 21:09.338
No, you're hesitating. I'm offering you
a promotion, and you're hesitating.

21:09.415 --> 21:10.973
I never saw myself as a columnist.

21:11.050 --> 21:14.349
Well, think of it as one of those times
when you surprise yourself.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.821
<i>- Okay.
- John, it's only a couple of times a week...</i>

21:17.890 --> 21:19.824
till I get a replacement forJerry.

21:19.892 --> 21:22.588
Then you can go back to doing
whatever the hell it was you were doing.

21:22.661 --> 21:26.495
<i>- What were you doing?
- Obituaries, methane leaks.</i>

21:26.565 --> 21:28.226
- Are you okay with this?
- Yes.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.097
- You don't seem very thrilled.
- No, it's a promotion.

21:30.169 --> 21:34.629
- We could take away the raise in pay if you like.
- No, no. I'm-Thank you.

21:34.707 --> 21:37.107
All right. Now you're talking.
Go on. Get to work.

21:37.176 --> 21:40.668
Oh! Marley. I think
he dislocated my shoulder.

21:40.746 --> 21:43.306
God. He doesn't even heel.

21:43.382 --> 21:46.283
He doesn't walk.
He just sprints.

21:46.352 --> 21:48.820
<i>Marley- God.</i>

21:48.887 --> 21:51.117
<i>Marley, stop.</i>

21:52.691 --> 21:54.852
<i>I had to pull him
off three dogs today.</i>

21:54.927 --> 21:57.418
- Poodles?
- Among others.

21:57.496 --> 21:59.487
I say we give him away to a farm.

21:59.565 --> 22:03.092
Isn't that usually what you do
with dogs that are out of control?

22:03.168 --> 22:06.604
<i>Well, usually you-
Usually you train them.</i>

22:06.672 --> 22:09.266
Or you train 'em.
Come on. Down. Go on.

22:09.341 --> 22:12.037
What are you doing?

22:12.111 --> 22:14.545
Arnie gave me a column.

22:14.613 --> 22:17.548
Are you kidding?
Baby, that's great.

22:17.616 --> 22:19.550
Oh, yeah. It's a big honor.

22:19.618 --> 22:21.552
I get to write about zoning laws...

22:21.620 --> 22:23.588
and give my opinion on yard sales.

22:23.656 --> 22:26.591
Whoa. Down, boy.
Easy with the enthusiasm.

22:26.659 --> 22:30.390
<i>Well, no, it's just, I don't even read
this crap when other people write it.</i>

22:30.462 --> 22:34.899
Now I'm supposed to, you know,
write two columns a week?

22:34.967 --> 22:37.231
<i>And you got nothin'for Tuesday.</i>

22:37.302 --> 22:39.736
<i>No. I got nothin' for Tuesday.</i>

22:39.805 --> 22:41.966
I bet you're gonna
think of something.

22:43.776 --> 22:47.234
Now, see, this gives me a little
inspiration, but it's not for a column.

22:47.312 --> 22:48.370
It's more like-

22:48.580 --> 22:51.014
Look at Marley.
Now he's eating the floor.

22:51.083 --> 22:53.984
Marley, stop.

22:54.053 --> 22:56.044
Marley, you're incorrigible.

22:56.121 --> 22:58.817
<i>Incorrigible? I don't believe in that word.</i>

22:58.891 --> 23:00.859
Every dog wants to learn.

23:00.926 --> 23:03.087
Hey, come here, baby.

23:03.162 --> 23:05.756
Yes, you're a good girl.
You're a good girl.

23:05.831 --> 23:07.765
Yes, you are.

23:07.833 --> 23:10.427
'Course, they can't learn
if their parents are weak-willed.

23:10.502 --> 23:13.027
Yeah. Well, I'm pretty
strong-willed, but-

23:13.105 --> 23:16.541
- Marley-
- Say hello to Marley.

23:16.608 --> 23:18.974
So which of you is gonna be the trainer?

23:19.044 --> 23:22.411
Well, we both thought we would, 'cause
we'd like him to listen to both of us at home.

23:22.481 --> 23:25.041
- We're married too. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

23:25.117 --> 23:27.051
A dog can only have one master.

23:27.119 --> 23:30.816
Which one of you has the most natural
authority in your own relationship?

23:32.357 --> 23:34.587
Well, maybe I'll stand
over there for the beginning.

23:34.660 --> 23:36.753
I thought so. Shall we?

23:38.731 --> 23:42.167
- Geez!
- All right, sit.

23:42.234 --> 23:44.600
Sit. Sit.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.661
<i>Sit. Marley.</i>

23:46.739 --> 23:49.105
Okay. Marley- Marley, sit.

23:49.174 --> 23:53.110
This, class, is a classic example of a dog...

23:53.178 --> 23:56.147
who has foolishly been
allowed to believe...

23:56.215 --> 23:59.810
<i>he is the alpha male of the pack...</i>

23:59.885 --> 24:02.911
and therefore, he can never be a happy animal.

24:02.988 --> 24:05.422
Yeah. He looks pretty miserable.

24:05.491 --> 24:09.484
You, joker, rotate in.

24:09.561 --> 24:11.825
<i>And lose the sunglasses.</i>

24:11.897 --> 24:13.922
Dog likes to be
looked at in the eye.

24:13.999 --> 24:16.559
<i>- Jawohl.
- I got it.</i>

24:16.635 --> 24:17.863
- Okay.
- Okay. You got him?

24:17.936 --> 24:18.868
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:18.937 --> 24:21.201
So. Collar your dogs.

24:22.875 --> 24:25.139
<i>Good boy.</i>

24:26.411 --> 24:28.845
<i>All right, dogs on the left.</i>

24:28.914 --> 24:31.212
<i>On the count of three.</i>

24:31.283 --> 24:34.309
One, two, three. Let's go.

24:36.188 --> 24:38.952
Very nice. Very good.

24:40.759 --> 24:42.852
Good.

24:42.928 --> 24:44.862
<i>- Hey!
- Correct him!</i>

24:44.930 --> 24:46.955
- Whoa!
- Rein in that dog.

24:47.032 --> 24:49.125
All right. All right, class.

24:49.201 --> 24:51.135
Come on. Let's line up again.

24:51.203 --> 24:54.639
Class, it's a simple question
of having confidence...

24:54.706 --> 24:56.833
in your own authority.

24:56.909 --> 24:59.878
I shall now demonstrate a simple walk.

24:59.945 --> 25:02.038
All right?

25:02.114 --> 25:04.048
Mr. Grogan?

25:04.116 --> 25:06.141
- Sorry.
- May I?

25:06.218 --> 25:08.652
<i>All right, even an unruly dog...</i>

25:08.720 --> 25:11.245
likes to obey his leader.

25:11.323 --> 25:14.724
Marley, heel.

25:17.296 --> 25:18.763
Yeah.

25:18.831 --> 25:21.061
Marley. Marley!

25:21.133 --> 25:24.933
<i>Marley! Marley!</i>

25:26.471 --> 25:29.065
Marley.

25:34.446 --> 25:36.744
<i>Careful. Marley, no!</i>

25:36.815 --> 25:38.840
<i>Marley!</i>

25:43.789 --> 25:46.883
Aaah! That's it. He is out.

25:46.959 --> 25:49.018
Sorry. Usually he does this with poodles.

25:49.094 --> 25:52.086
That dog is a bad influence on the others.

25:53.165 --> 25:55.793
<i>Now, leg humping is like a virus.</i>

25:55.868 --> 25:58.860
Once it takes hold of the group- No.

25:58.937 --> 26:01.405
<i>- Okay.
- He has got to go.</i>

26:01.473 --> 26:04.601
It was maybe your hair.

26:04.676 --> 26:08.009
- Reminded him of a poodle.
- Never bring him back.

26:09.514 --> 26:12.210
<i>Right from the beginning
she had me in her sights.</i>

26:12.284 --> 26:14.980
- I know. She really did.
- Marley wouldn't take any of her crap.

26:15.053 --> 26:17.180
That's why he got kicked out.

26:17.256 --> 26:20.419
You are now the world's worst dog.

26:20.492 --> 26:22.653
You've been kicked out
of obedience school.

26:22.728 --> 26:25.663
You know, there is
something else that we could do.

26:25.731 --> 26:28.393
No, I know. We just-We get a-

26:30.469 --> 26:35.497
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm smiling, but I'm serious. No.

26:37.075 --> 26:39.509
It's not gonna be so bad, buddy.

26:39.578 --> 26:42.069
You'll see. Sex is overrated.

26:43.348 --> 26:47.341
Aw, I can't tell you that,
'cause you know it's a lie.

26:47.419 --> 26:49.649
Poor son of a bitch.

26:49.721 --> 26:53.157
Okay. You wanna come up?
Yeah. That's the least I can do.

26:53.225 --> 26:55.455
<i>- Marley!
- Get a little fresh air.</i>

26:55.527 --> 26:59.429
Oh, gosh. It's like he's
walking the plank.

26:59.498 --> 27:01.728
I mean, that's what
breaks my heart, is he's so happy.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.030
- He doesn't know what's coming.
- Honey, he's gonna be fine.

27:05.671 --> 27:08.162
- Oh, no, no, no. That makes me nervous.
- He's okay.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.037
He's just getting a little air.

27:14.513 --> 27:17.038
<i>It's like Of Mice and Men.</i>

27:17.115 --> 27:19.675
- No, Marley-
- Oh, John, please-

27:21.219 --> 27:23.380
- Oh, my God.
- He's makin' a break for it.

27:23.455 --> 27:26.117
He's onto our evil plan.

27:26.191 --> 27:29.058
- Pull over.
- I can't stop here. I can't.

27:29.127 --> 27:32.494
- Honey, pull over.
- I'm trying to. There's a ton of traffic.

27:35.734 --> 27:38.635
- Pull over!
- All right, all right. All right.

27:40.372 --> 27:44.001
- Jesus.
- I need a little help here.

27:44.076 --> 27:45.634
Hey, get a leash.

27:45.711 --> 27:49.670
<i>- Shut up.
- He's losing his balls today. Cut him some slack.</i>

27:49.748 --> 27:51.773
You got him? Careful. Careful.

27:58.256 --> 28:01.225
This is a rough draft, 'cause I'd like
to take another pass at it.

28:05.630 --> 28:07.825
You know, the beginning,
I think I might want-

28:07.899 --> 28:10.595
I think we can maybe lose that,
'cause I think it gets a little bit "jokey. "

28:13.605 --> 28:16.438
I just reread it, and I didn't think
it really worked at all. I'm sorry.

28:16.508 --> 28:18.908
- I'm gonna go back and do the zoning piece.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

28:18.977 --> 28:21.104
What are you apologizing for?
This stuff is hysterical.

28:21.179 --> 28:24.376
<i>- Really?
- I'm laughing my head off at this.</i>

28:24.449 --> 28:26.940
The-The getting kicked out
of obedience school...

28:27.019 --> 28:28.953
the humping, the great escape-

28:29.021 --> 28:31.683
That's really funny stuff.
I'm laughing my ass off.

28:31.757 --> 28:33.691
<i>It's hysterical stuff.</i>

28:33.759 --> 28:35.590
Run it- the way it is.

28:37.529 --> 28:39.724
Thanks.

28:39.798 --> 28:42.892
Listen. You know what makes it work?

28:42.968 --> 28:46.404
What makes it work is that
you put yourself into it. I like that.

28:46.471 --> 28:49.304
<i>- Good.
- Look, I know you're a reporter and all...</i>

28:49.374 --> 28:51.604
but could you do
a few more things like this?

28:51.676 --> 28:53.109
<i>- Sure.
- Great.</i>

28:53.178 --> 28:56.739
- Okay, great.
- And tell your dog not to feel too bad.

28:56.815 --> 28:59.875
Sooner or later,
we all lose our balls.

28:59.951 --> 29:01.919
Hey, good to know.

29:23.909 --> 29:25.604

32:19.184 --> 32:21.152
Why don't you just
let him off the leash?

32:21.219 --> 32:24.416
Because although I love him,
I don't trust him.

32:24.489 --> 32:26.423
<i>Honey, it's been two years.
He's never had an accident.</i>

32:26.491 --> 32:28.425
I know, 'cause I never
let him off the leash.

32:28.493 --> 32:31.724
We're not gonna be the guys who get
Dog Beach shut down, are we, Marley?

32:31.796 --> 32:33.923
Nope.

32:33.999 --> 32:37.435
Okay. So what's next?

32:37.502 --> 32:39.663
Um, ice cream?

32:39.738 --> 32:41.672
No. I mean on your list.

32:41.740 --> 32:43.401
- My list?
- Jen, the list-

32:43.475 --> 32:46.501
Your little play list that you had when
we got married that had the game plan.

32:46.578 --> 32:48.876
- It was basically my marching orders.
- My plan?

32:48.947 --> 32:52.713
Your plan. I wanna know
what's next. Scare me.

32:52.784 --> 32:55.116
- You really wanna know?
- Hit me.

32:55.186 --> 32:59.953
- Well, it's a toss-up between the new roof-
- Very practical.

33:01.026 --> 33:03.961
And, uh- and a baby.

33:11.436 --> 33:13.700
I could live with a few leaks.

33:14.906 --> 33:17.136
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple.

33:17.208 --> 33:20.006
But you know, a couple leaks
turn into maybe one big leak...

33:20.078 --> 33:23.377
and then that big leak becomes
a very big responsibility.

33:23.448 --> 33:26.645
- That's true.
- We may want to think about fixing a lot of things...

33:26.718 --> 33:29.118
- before we start-
- Well, honey, we already fixed Marley.

33:29.187 --> 33:32.884
If we fix too many more things, then
I think this conversation becomes moot.

33:32.957 --> 33:35.824
<i>John, are you serious?</i>

33:35.894 --> 33:38.055
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

33:38.129 --> 33:40.689
<i>- You realize we're not talking about an actual roof here.
- Yes.</i>

33:40.765 --> 33:43.131
I got that. About halfway
through I picked it up.

33:43.201 --> 33:45.169
Good metaphor though.

33:45.236 --> 33:48.933
And you're not just saying this 'cause
you think it'll lead to some funny columns?

33:49.007 --> 33:51.669
Honey, come on. I mean,
if I get some funny columns...

33:51.743 --> 33:54.405
that's collateral damage
I think we can live with.

33:54.479 --> 33:57.573
I mean, I'm ready... if you are.

33:57.649 --> 33:59.879
Well, instead of trying
to have a baby...

33:59.951 --> 34:04.251
why don't just stop
trying not to have one?

34:04.322 --> 34:07.291
- Okay, if I'm following you
correctly, and I think I am- - Uh-huh.

34:07.359 --> 34:10.692
This is the part-We head back,
we take it off, we get it on.

34:10.762 --> 34:13.322
Yes, but you'll- It'll have a little
more romance than that.

34:13.398 --> 34:17.766
- Yeah, we'll get some candles, some Sade of course.
- Sade?

34:23.975 --> 34:25.101
- Honey?
- Yeah?

34:25.176 --> 34:27.371
Did you have kibble today?

34:27.445 --> 34:29.811
Marley, come on. Marley, go.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.815
Honey, he's a dog.
He won't know what he's looking at.

34:31.882 --> 34:34.511
No, no, trust me. He knows,
and he resents the hell out of me.

34:34.585 --> 34:37.646
- Go on, Marley. You have to go.
- Oh, baby, please focus. Focus.

34:37.722 --> 34:39.690
- Okay. All right.
- Mm-hmm.

34:44.329 --> 34:47.730
<i>Good. Good. It's even better
than the last one.</i>

34:47.799 --> 34:49.891
<i>- Thank you.
- You're very good, Grogan.</i>

34:49.967 --> 34:52.994
I like that piece you did
in Boca last week on the woman.

34:53.071 --> 34:55.505
<i>- What'd you call her?
- "Boca-hantas. "</i>

34:55.572 --> 34:58.633
- Is that true- She had her boobs done four times?
- That's what she said.

34:58.710 --> 35:02.043
Hysterical. And is that true
about you and your wife?

35:02.113 --> 35:05.640
- You're trying to have a kid?
- Well, you know, we're not really trying...

35:05.717 --> 35:07.685
<i>- 'cause we don't wanna-
- How does that work?</i>

35:07.752 --> 35:10.220
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, you having sex?

35:10.288 --> 35:12.483
<i>- Yeah.
- Did you pull the goalie?</i>

35:12.557 --> 35:14.286
<i>- Yeah.
- Then you're trying.</i>

35:14.359 --> 35:17.157
Congratulations. Good work.

35:17.228 --> 35:19.423
"Not trying" trying?

35:19.497 --> 35:22.432
Oh, yeah. 'Course, you'd know that
if you ever read my column.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.663
Hey, all due respect, but does
anybody ever read your column?

35:25.737 --> 35:28.365
Come on. I bring Marley out here
to help you run your game...

35:28.440 --> 35:31.273
on these poor girls,
and this is the thanks we get.

35:31.342 --> 35:34.607
- How long you been at it?
- A few months.

35:34.679 --> 35:37.341
- What changed your mind?
- Well, here's the thing.

35:37.415 --> 35:39.713
I'm actually married to someone...

35:39.784 --> 35:42.344
and I care about what she wants.

35:42.420 --> 35:44.354
<i>Well, is it what you want?</i>

35:44.422 --> 35:46.185
Yeah.

35:46.257 --> 35:50.284
- I guess that answers my other question.
- Yeah?

35:50.361 --> 35:52.295
I'm about to do a piece
on the growth...

35:52.363 --> 35:54.729
<i>of the domestic drug trade
for the Times magazine.</i>

35:54.799 --> 35:57.495
<i>- You're freelancing for the New York Times?
- Yeah.</i>

35:57.569 --> 35:59.833
Yeah, but it's a big story.

35:59.904 --> 36:03.169
Too big for one guy and, uh, I was
hoping you'd write it with me.

36:04.809 --> 36:06.800
Are you kidding me?

36:06.878 --> 36:10.041
- Be a chance for us to work together.
- Yeah, I would love that.

36:10.114 --> 36:12.810
Of course, it will be
a lot of work, a lot of travel.

36:12.884 --> 36:15.250
I would hope so.

36:15.320 --> 36:18.517
Maybe not the best job for, uh,
somebody with a kid on the way.

36:18.590 --> 36:22.993
Well, that's not necessarily
happening right this very second.

36:23.061 --> 36:25.962
<i>Let me talk it-There she is.</i>

36:27.432 --> 36:29.900
- Honey, how are you?
- Hi.

36:29.968 --> 36:33.870
I'm just calling to let you know that
there's a naked woman in your bed.

36:33.938 --> 36:37.601
Why don't the two of you get started,
and I'll be there as soon as I can?

36:37.675 --> 36:40.439
Oh, very funny.

36:40.512 --> 36:42.537
But seriously,
can you come home now?

36:46.150 --> 36:49.244
Hey. We're home.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.312
<i>Hi.</i>

36:52.390 --> 36:56.520
You know the baby thing? I've been
thinking, maybe we should take a break.

36:58.363 --> 37:03.562
You know? Obviously it's not working,
and maybe it's nature's way...

37:03.635 --> 37:05.933
of saying now's
not the right timing.

37:07.505 --> 37:12.101
I mean, maybe it's a sign that we're
not quite ready for this, that-

37:12.176 --> 37:14.041
- I mean, have we really thought this-
- John.

37:15.046 --> 37:17.412
I'm pregnant.

37:18.516 --> 37:20.450
<i>- Great.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

37:20.518 --> 37:24.079
Wow. Great. Really?

37:24.155 --> 37:25.213
<i>- Yeah.
- Yes.</i>

37:25.290 --> 37:27.224
You were-You were just saying-

37:27.292 --> 37:29.317
No, don't worry.
That was, like-

37:29.394 --> 37:31.453
It sounds so awkward now,
like I just have this, like...

37:31.529 --> 37:35.556
very, you know, idiotic
soliloquy that doesn't apply...

37:35.633 --> 37:37.624
and I'm really excited.

37:37.702 --> 37:39.761
<i>- Do you want to start over?
- I would love to.</i>

37:39.837 --> 37:41.270
<i>- That would be great. Can we?
- By all means.</i>

37:41.339 --> 37:44.172
Good.

37:45.843 --> 37:49.939
- I'm pregnant.
- What? No!

37:50.014 --> 37:52.244
Yes!

37:52.317 --> 37:54.842
<i>Listen. Don't make
the same mistake I did.</i>

37:54.919 --> 37:57.683
- What?
- There's gonna come a time very soon...

37:57.755 --> 38:01.384
- where her ankles are gonna swell up.
- No, I'm ready for that.

38:01.459 --> 38:03.723
- She's gonna have blotches all over her face.
- Yeah.

38:03.795 --> 38:05.729
She'll be 40 pounds overweight.

38:05.797 --> 38:08.322
<i>- She'll be throwing up all the time.
- I'm not ready for that.</i>

38:08.399 --> 38:10.333
She's gonna look at you
and she's gonna say...

38:10.401 --> 38:12.767
"You bastard. You did this to me. "

38:12.837 --> 38:15.704
What-What happened to the glow?
The-You know, the-

38:15.773 --> 38:18.298
There's no glow. Get her a gift.

38:18.376 --> 38:20.708
That'll dissipate some of the anger.

38:20.778 --> 38:22.769
Uh, earrings, uh, bracelet-

38:22.847 --> 38:24.781
That's thoughtful.
It's a good idea.

38:24.849 --> 38:28.012
- Maybe I'll get on it right now.
- There's a jewelry store on the corner.

38:28.086 --> 38:29.314
- All right.
- Mention my name.

38:31.923 --> 38:34.016
Oh, John.

38:34.092 --> 38:36.856
It's just beautiful.

38:36.928 --> 38:39.795
It's just... beautiful.

38:39.864 --> 38:41.798
Honey, thank you.

38:41.866 --> 38:43.993
You're welcome. I was just
walking by this-Thinking of you-

38:44.068 --> 38:46.036
- Yeah?
- And I saw that in the window and I go...

38:46.104 --> 38:48.800
- "I'm getting this. "
- That's so sweet.

38:48.873 --> 38:51.637
- Yeah, well- Do you like it?
- I love it.

38:51.709 --> 38:54.769
Yeah, well, put it on. Or let me put it on.
I think it's better luck.

38:54.846 --> 38:56.541
- Where'd it go?
- What'd you do with it?

38:56.614 --> 38:58.377
- You just set it down, I thought.
- I just had it.

38:58.449 --> 39:00.007
- Did you drop it?
- No, I put it right here.

39:00.084 --> 39:02.211
It didn't just disappear.

39:02.286 --> 39:04.220
Oh, God.

39:06.791 --> 39:09.487
- Marley. No- Marley, spit it out.
- No, no.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.824
Go to the kitchen. Go to the kitchen.

39:11.896 --> 39:13.830
<i>Marley, I have a treat.</i>

39:13.898 --> 39:16.492
Come here.

39:16.567 --> 39:19.400
<i>Stay. Marley, stay.</i>

39:19.470 --> 39:22.837
<i>Good boy. Yeah.</i>

39:25.309 --> 39:29.405
Marley!

39:32.250 --> 39:34.775
Marley!

39:34.852 --> 39:37.116
<i>Come here, Marley.</i>

39:38.756 --> 39:40.951
Geez.

39:44.262 --> 39:46.662
- Marley, drop it.
- Marley.

39:46.731 --> 39:50.189
- Marley.
- Is it there? Oh, honey, I don't see it.

39:53.137 --> 39:56.436
Marley, you gotta
lay off the mangoes.

39:57.675 --> 40:00.166
You know, years ago,
when I imagined my life...

40:00.244 --> 40:02.735
somehow standing in the backyard...

40:02.814 --> 40:06.648
<i>hosing down your crap, looking
for my wife's swallowed, recycled...</i>

40:06.718 --> 40:09.949
ass-kissing gift
never jumped to mind.

40:10.021 --> 40:11.955
Which shows you gotta dream big...

40:12.023 --> 40:14.116
<i>'cause- Oh. Jackpot.</i>

40:14.392 --> 40:19.125
My, that's a lovely necklace. So shiny.

40:19.197 --> 40:23.463
- Yes, it is.
- And how's that crazy dog of yours?

40:23.534 --> 40:25.832
I read your columns every week.

40:25.903 --> 40:27.928
- Oh.
- Oh. So you're the one.

40:28.005 --> 40:31.634
I think you'll get a kick out of next week's column.

40:31.709 --> 40:34.439
The heartbeat'll be very fast-
Like a little train. That's normal.

40:34.512 --> 40:36.639
Is it- Is it too early
to tell the sex?

40:36.714 --> 40:38.511
L- Not that I care.

40:38.583 --> 40:42.110
Can be male, female-
Whatever sex he wants.

40:42.186 --> 40:44.586
<i>Unambiguous genitalia...</i>

40:44.655 --> 40:47.453
- if I had my druthers, but-
- Shh. Hang on.

40:50.495 --> 40:52.725
Sometimes you can't hear it, depending
on how the baby's lying.

40:52.797 --> 40:55.163
- You're 10 weeks, right?
- Monday I'll be 10 weeks.

40:55.233 --> 40:58.600
Hmm. Well, might be
a little too early for that.

40:58.669 --> 41:01.331
Let's go right to the sonogram.
Did you bring your blank tape?

41:01.405 --> 41:03.930
- Oh, yes.
- Yes. Yes.

41:04.008 --> 41:06.442
- That's warm.
- Mm-hmm.

41:06.511 --> 41:08.945
- Let's get a good picture for you first, huh?
- Okay.

41:09.013 --> 41:12.107
It'll be right up
on the monitor here.

41:19.056 --> 41:21.490
Excuse me. I'll be just a minute.

41:32.436 --> 41:34.370
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

41:34.438 --> 41:37.635
Let's take a look
at your baby, shall we?

41:39.677 --> 41:41.645
All right.

41:48.519 --> 41:50.487
Is there anything in there?

41:53.724 --> 41:56.318
Not what you would expect
to see at 10 weeks.

41:56.394 --> 41:58.385
I'm not- I'm not quite 10 weeks.

41:58.462 --> 42:01.761
At Monday it's still,
I guess, nine weeks.

42:01.833 --> 42:04.563
Nine weeks.

42:04.635 --> 42:07.126
There's no heartbeat, Jen.

42:09.407 --> 42:12.137
I'm very, very sorry.

42:12.210 --> 42:14.940
These things-They happen sometimes.
We don't know why.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.014
<i>You're young. You have your health.</i>

42:18.082 --> 42:20.812
<i>Couple months,
you guys can try again.</i>

42:20.885 --> 42:23.786
I'm sorry. All right, I'm gonna-

42:23.855 --> 42:26.847
<i>I'll leave you guys alone for a moment
and we'll talk some more.</i>

42:26.924 --> 42:29.017
I'm very sorry.

42:49.847 --> 42:52.839
Well, in a couple months
we can try again, okay?

43:18.209 --> 43:20.200
You want some tea?

43:23.714 --> 43:27.309
You know what I was thinking-
That we, uh-

43:27.385 --> 43:29.512
We still have those tickets
from your parents...

43:29.587 --> 43:32.613
for the honeymoon in Ireland.

43:32.690 --> 43:36.592
We could finally do that.
Maybe take some time off.

43:38.129 --> 43:40.222
<i>Jenny?</i>

44:23.975 --> 44:27.536
- Oh, he's... big.
- Oh, yeah. He's a hundred pounds.

44:27.611 --> 44:30.205
- Now, he just wants to say hello here.
- Yeah.

44:30.281 --> 44:32.749
<i>- He loves people.
- Just be calm. You just stay still.</i>

44:32.817 --> 44:34.682
And you're a dog person, right?

44:34.752 --> 44:37.243
- Actually, I'm-
- Ready? Here we go.

44:37.321 --> 44:38.720
Go on, you can say hello.

44:38.789 --> 44:40.814
No, no, don't let him do that.
Sorry. Sorry.

44:40.891 --> 44:42.916
All you have to do is-
You just knee him if he does that.

44:42.994 --> 44:44.586
<i>That shouldn't happen all the time.
Just when you walk through the door.</i>

44:44.662 --> 44:48.029
<i>But here, read this. This'll tell you
everything you need to know.</i>

44:48.099 --> 44:50.158
- I've got the bags here.
- Have you got everything?

44:50.234 --> 44:53.169
- Thank you. Come on, honey.
- Can you get that door?

44:53.237 --> 44:55.432
<i>- I got it.
- Okay. Here we are.</i>

44:55.506 --> 44:57.201
<i>- Honey, we're really late.
- Oh! Marley. Marley.</i>

44:57.274 --> 44:59.868
<i>Debby, welcome to our home.</i>

44:59.944 --> 45:03.107
<i>Marley is a spirited dog
who loves interaction.</i>

45:03.180 --> 45:05.876
<i>We've never left him before,
but we are sure he'll behave...</i>

45:05.950 --> 45:07.884
<i>just as he does when we're at home.</i>

45:11.288 --> 45:14.121
<i>There arejust a few things about
Marley you're gonna need to know.</i>

45:14.191 --> 45:16.557
<i>He eats three times a day.</i>

45:17.828 --> 45:20.262
<i>Lfhe looks starved, feed him again.</i>

45:21.999 --> 45:24.866
<i>Now, of course, all of this food
is gonna have to go somewhere...</i>

45:24.935 --> 45:28.871
<i>so use the blue pooper scooper,
and watch your step.</i>

45:28.939 --> 45:31.737
<i>Don't worry about the color.
He likes mangoes.</i>

45:31.809 --> 45:34.039
<i>Marley is not allowed
to drink out of the toilet...</i>

45:34.111 --> 45:36.545
<i>so be sure to keep the lid closed...</i>

45:36.614 --> 45:38.548
<i>and the brick on the lid.</i>

45:38.616 --> 45:40.550
<i>You know, actually,
you might want...</i>

45:40.618 --> 45:42.552
<i>tojust keep the bathroom door
shut in general.</i>

45:42.620 --> 45:45.282
<i>Like most dogs, Marley
needs a lot of exercise...</i>

45:45.356 --> 45:50.293
<i>so try to take him for a walk or a run
every morning and every evening.</i>

45:50.361 --> 45:52.659
Marley, let go!

45:52.730 --> 45:55.130
Let go. Let go. Let go.
Aaah! Marley, no!

45:55.199 --> 45:58.566
<i>And be sure to lock the doors
and windows before you go to sleep.</i>

45:58.636 --> 46:00.001
Shoo! Shoo!

46:00.071 --> 46:02.562
<i>But don't worry.
Marley is an excellent watchdog.</i>

46:04.642 --> 46:07.634
<i>You can rest easy at night
knowing he's on thejob.</i>

46:07.711 --> 46:09.975
<i>Thunderstorms are his weak point.</i>

46:10.047 --> 46:12.675
<i>You can give him sedatives
if you think a storm is arriving.</i>

46:12.750 --> 46:16.277
Okay. Here you go. Marley.
Marley, come back here.

46:16.353 --> 46:19.789
<i>He doesn't like them, so push them
down his throat as far as they go.</i>

46:19.857 --> 46:23.088
Welcome. Welcome.
I'm Mrs. Butterly.

46:23.160 --> 46:27.620
<i>Now finally, we do not allow Marley
to get up on any piece of furniture...</i>

46:27.698 --> 46:29.825
<i>chew on anything except his toys.</i>

46:31.535 --> 46:35.301
<i>Other than that, enjoy him.
Love, Jenny and John.</i>

46:35.506 --> 46:40.102
We serve tea every day at 4:00,
and dinner at 6:00 sharp.

46:40.177 --> 46:44.307
<i>Oh, and these blankets are woolen.
Good heat in 'em.</i>

46:44.381 --> 46:47.441
- So-So they're electric?
- Oh, not in this house.

46:47.518 --> 46:51.181
My brother died in a fire,
God rest his soul.

46:51.255 --> 46:54.952
In this room, actually.

46:55.025 --> 46:57.721
<i>Oh, not to worry.
It's been re-papered.</i>

46:57.795 --> 47:00.229
Well, good night to ya both.

47:00.297 --> 47:02.231
- And God bless you.
- God bless.

47:02.299 --> 47:04.631
Thank you. You- Bless you.

47:08.472 --> 47:11.305
<i>That was just weird.</i>

47:15.079 --> 47:16.740
<i>Oh, gosh.</i>

47:16.814 --> 47:21.114
Honey, I- I know that we
haven't had sex since-You know.

47:21.185 --> 47:25.053
But I don't think we're breaking
that streak tonight.

47:25.122 --> 47:27.056
No, no. I don't-

47:27.124 --> 47:29.058
I don't want to break
the streak here.

47:29.126 --> 47:31.754
<i>This doesn't feel-
I mean, I think I could...</i>

47:31.829 --> 47:36.198
you know, handle God watching,
and his mother, but-

47:36.267 --> 47:40.260
But not- not this little
porcelain pontiff right here.

47:40.337 --> 47:43.738
It's July, and I think I can see my breath.

47:43.807 --> 47:46.708
<i>- Honey, I can't feel my toes.
- That's not good.</i>

47:46.777 --> 47:49.337
I wanna check on that.

47:51.415 --> 47:53.747
<i>Oh, good God, shush.</i>

47:53.817 --> 47:58.447
It's not the bed. It's the shrieks
of oversexed souls in hell.

48:01.692 --> 48:03.819
Don't you want to join them?

48:05.729 --> 48:07.663
Really?

48:07.731 --> 48:09.926
Mm-hmm.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.991
We don't have to.

48:12.069 --> 48:16.267
I know, but the idea that it hasn't
happened here in 50 years is just-

48:16.340 --> 48:18.968
It's kind of turning me on.

48:23.347 --> 48:25.713
Honey, I missed you.

48:51.976 --> 48:53.910
Marley! Hi, honey.

48:53.978 --> 48:55.912
- Marley.
- Ohh.

48:55.980 --> 48:57.914
Come here.

48:57.982 --> 48:59.347
<i>- We missed you so much.
- Hey, Debby.</i>

48:59.416 --> 49:01.850
There were 11 thunderstorms
while you were gone.

49:01.919 --> 49:05.685
<i>Eleven. And you were right.
He doesn't like thunderstorms.</i>

49:05.756 --> 49:08.418
Wow. Okay. Yeah. Eleven.
That's a lot of thunderstorms.

49:08.492 --> 49:11.359
Oh, and just so you know, I am
a dog person, but that's not a dog.

49:11.428 --> 49:15.694
That is evil with a dog face that is
humping my leg and peeing on your carpet.

49:15.766 --> 49:19.133
- Marley.
- Marley, stop that.

49:25.743 --> 49:29.179
Marley, come on.
It's just thunder. No barking.

49:33.284 --> 49:36.447
Marley, come on.
It's just thunder.

49:38.222 --> 49:40.190
Marley, come on.

49:40.257 --> 49:41.519
Jenny?

49:41.592 --> 49:44.527
Can you help me out here?

49:44.595 --> 49:48.292
I got 20 minutes
to file this column, and I gotta-

49:48.365 --> 49:50.697
<i>Jenny?</i>

49:50.768 --> 49:53.896
- Ah, the luck of the Irish.
- What?

50:44.355 --> 50:46.289
Mmm.

50:59.002 --> 51:01.027
Whoa.

51:01.105 --> 51:04.734
Wow. Whoo.

51:04.808 --> 51:07.242
Aah. Ooh. Oh, God.

51:07.311 --> 51:09.939
<i>John? Honey. John.
John, wake up.</i>

51:10.013 --> 51:11.947
- Yeah?
- It's time.

51:12.015 --> 51:14.745
...comfortable.

51:14.818 --> 51:16.752
Okay, but- Ooh.

51:16.820 --> 51:18.947
- God!
- You all right? You all right?

51:19.022 --> 51:20.011
You okay?

51:20.090 --> 51:21.614
No, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt her.

51:21.692 --> 51:23.751
Try not to scream,
'cause I don't want him to kill me.

51:23.827 --> 51:25.954
You remembered to install
the car seat this weekend?

51:26.029 --> 51:28.589
- They won't let us take the baby home-
- Right. I wouldn't forget that.

51:28.665 --> 51:30.758
- I know that. I'm sorry.
- You got that?

51:30.834 --> 51:31.926
I got it. I got it.

51:35.639 --> 51:38.301
Yeah, come on, Marley.
Help me out here.

51:38.375 --> 51:43.005
You can chew through drywall, Marley.
This is nothing for you.

51:43.080 --> 51:45.674
Good. Yeah.

51:47.885 --> 51:49.819
You're gonna stay here.

51:49.887 --> 51:51.878
This bone will keep you busy now.

51:51.955 --> 51:55.254
Hopefully, no thunderstorms.
And I'm off like-

52:17.114 --> 52:19.309
Who's your daddy? Come here.

52:29.660 --> 52:31.594
Here's the thing.

52:31.662 --> 52:34.688
In about two minutes
we're gonna bring home the baby...

52:34.765 --> 52:38.826
and you'd be doing me a really
big favor if you didn't freak out.

52:40.404 --> 52:42.736
And I'm gonna try to do the same.

52:47.010 --> 52:49.911
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Yes.

52:49.980 --> 52:51.914
<i>Hi. Come here.</i>

52:51.982 --> 52:54.041
Hi, baby. Oh, hi. Hi, sweetie.

52:54.117 --> 52:57.484
Hi, Marley. Oh, come on.

52:57.554 --> 52:59.988
Come here. Okay.

53:00.057 --> 53:04.357
- Marley.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. It would be a bummer if you ate the baby.

53:05.996 --> 53:08.726
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Shh.

53:08.799 --> 53:12.929
- Just, uh-
- Marley, this is Patrick.

53:14.671 --> 53:17.196
Not to be confused with a chew toy.

53:17.274 --> 53:19.242
Although it may look like one.

53:19.309 --> 53:21.834
Say hi. See, honey?
He's not eating the baby.

53:21.912 --> 53:24.437
Very good.

53:34.491 --> 53:36.789
<i>Yeah. No, I have a quote for it right here.</i>

53:36.860 --> 53:40.125
Well, have Legal call them again
and get a release for it.

53:40.197 --> 53:42.427
They told me it was on the record.

53:42.499 --> 53:45.468
I don't- Patrick?
Honey, be careful with those toys.

53:45.536 --> 53:48.061
You know Marley gets-
No, Carla, I'm not talking to you.

53:48.138 --> 53:50.470
Will you just call them
and get a release?

53:50.541 --> 53:52.475
L- I- I'll call you right back.
Call you right back.

54:12.863 --> 54:15.798
Those days are over for us, amigo.

54:15.866 --> 54:18.130
We had a good run though.

54:43.527 --> 54:44.824
Come on, Marley.

54:45.729 --> 54:47.458
<i>I know this is gonna sound crazy...</i>

54:47.531 --> 54:50.728
but what's that thing called
when you owe money on a house?

54:50.801 --> 54:52.735
- It starts with an "M."
- Mortgage.

54:52.803 --> 54:54.737
Mortgage.

54:54.805 --> 54:57.603
Wow. Is it possible
to be this tired?

54:57.674 --> 55:00.643
You know what?
I'm gonna get up with him tonight.

55:00.711 --> 55:04.010
No, you won't.
You don't hear him.

55:04.081 --> 55:07.778
- Yeah. You're right.
- I don't know... why.

55:07.851 --> 55:09.978
I'm just a blessedly sound sleeper.

55:10.053 --> 55:12.283
Honey, I do have to go
into the office tomorrow though.

55:12.356 --> 55:14.324
Will you watch him then for me?

55:14.391 --> 55:16.552
It'll be my pleasure.

55:16.627 --> 55:21.030
- How long are we talking about?
- I don't know.

55:21.098 --> 55:23.862
It's not quite what
you expected, huh?

55:23.934 --> 55:26.232
I don't know what I expected.

55:26.303 --> 55:29.704
- I never thought Marley would seem like the easy one.
- I know.

55:29.773 --> 55:31.707
I know, but you know what?

55:31.775 --> 55:36.212
We adjusted to him,
and we'll adjust to the baby.

55:36.279 --> 55:40.010
I'm just trying
to remember us from before.

55:40.083 --> 55:42.517
You mean those, uh-
Those younger-

55:42.586 --> 55:45.919
- Yeah.
- Sexier, better-looking people?

55:45.989 --> 55:48.617
- Yeah.
- I remember them. I remember them vaguely.

55:48.692 --> 55:50.683
I miss them.

55:50.761 --> 55:52.695
Mmm. They're here.

55:52.763 --> 55:54.856
They're here. They're just really tired.

55:54.931 --> 55:57.263
Mmm?

55:57.334 --> 56:01.600
What? Now you're jealous?

56:05.409 --> 56:08.242
Stay here.

56:08.311 --> 56:10.245
- Call the police.
- Okay.

56:21.692 --> 56:24.627
Hey, hey, hey. Are you all right?
What happened?

56:24.695 --> 56:28.688
He told me not to scream
or he'd stab me, but I screamed.

56:28.765 --> 56:30.995
- But I screamed-
- Okay, now, just sit down. Just sit down.

56:31.068 --> 56:34.128
- And he stabbed me.
- It's all right. That's okay. Hold on.

56:34.204 --> 56:36.195
- Where's your mother?
- At work.

56:36.273 --> 56:38.264
It's okay. It's not that bad.

56:38.341 --> 56:40.536
Keep your hand placed right here.

56:40.610 --> 56:43.773
Okay. Now, I called the police.

56:43.847 --> 56:47.146
Everything's gonna be okay.

56:47.217 --> 56:50.050
You know, in all the time I've lived here,
I've never gotten your name.

56:50.120 --> 56:52.714
- Lisa.
- Okay-

56:52.789 --> 56:54.723
I'm gonna sit right here, Lisa.

56:54.791 --> 56:57.123
You're gonna keep
your hands placed there...

56:57.194 --> 57:00.288
and we're gonna wait
for the police to get here.

57:00.363 --> 57:02.354
And they're gonna take care of this.

57:02.432 --> 57:05.128
All right? Okay?

57:05.202 --> 57:07.670
Look at me. It's all right.

57:07.738 --> 57:09.137
It's all right.

57:09.339 --> 57:10.806
<i>Safest neighborhood?</i>

57:10.874 --> 57:13.741
- In terms of crime, I'd say you're lookin' at Boca.
- Boca?

57:13.810 --> 57:16.108
- Mmm.
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.

57:16.179 --> 57:19.740
<i>- That's the way it is, John.
- Okay. Thanks.</i>

57:21.418 --> 57:23.352
<i>Boca. Not so bad.</i>

57:23.420 --> 57:25.411
<i>You got kids playin'in the street.
I don't know.</i>

57:25.489 --> 57:29.118
What do you guys think? We might
live here one day... if we can afford it.

57:29.192 --> 57:31.126
<i>Here we go.</i>

57:31.194 --> 57:33.560
I got you right there.

57:35.699 --> 57:38.463
Stay. Marley, no.

57:38.535 --> 57:40.730
Marley. Marley.

57:40.804 --> 57:44.399
<i>And don't you love this kitchen?
And look at the state-of-the-art appliances.</i>

57:44.474 --> 57:47.443
<i>My favorite part- the pool. It's-</i>

57:50.380 --> 57:53.543
<i>- Um, why don't we look over here?
- Can I get a brochure?</i>

57:53.617 --> 57:56.051
- Uh, sure.
- Looks nice.

57:57.888 --> 57:59.879
Whose dog is that?

58:02.592 --> 58:04.583
<i>Jenny?</i>

58:06.830 --> 58:08.821
Honey?

58:08.899 --> 58:10.958
<i>Jen?</i>

58:13.036 --> 58:16.802
<i>- Hey, you okay? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. No,
I'm good. Where have you guys been?</i>

58:16.873 --> 58:18.807
- I wanna show you something.
- What?

58:18.875 --> 58:22.504
It's a house. Now, it's a little pricey...

58:22.579 --> 58:24.877
<i>but I think we can do it.</i>

58:24.948 --> 58:26.882
<i>- Boca?
- I know, I know.</i>

58:26.950 --> 58:30.078
But I talked to Frank Bennett on the Metro
desk and he says it's the safest neighborhood.

58:30.153 --> 58:32.417
<i>John, I'm just not sure now
is the right time.</i>

58:32.489 --> 58:35.981
<i>Jen, when do you think is the right time,
after one of us gets stabbed in the driveway?</i>

58:36.059 --> 58:38.823
<i>- John.
- Honey, it's cramped in here.</i>

58:38.895 --> 58:41.090
Remember, this was supposed
to be a three-year house.

58:41.164 --> 58:45.157
I know. I know that. I just don't think
we can afford to buy a new one.

58:45.235 --> 58:48.671
- I know, but, honey, we can. With both
our salaries- - Honey, I'm pregnant.

58:48.738 --> 58:50.501
Really?

58:52.008 --> 58:56.001
- Are you sure?
- Come here.

59:04.154 --> 59:06.588
Pretty sure.

59:06.656 --> 59:08.851
<i>Four for four. Wow.</i>

59:08.925 --> 59:10.859
- Hold on.
- That's great.

59:10.927 --> 59:12.861
- Mm-hmm.
- Congratulations.

59:12.929 --> 59:14.863
<i>- Uh-huh. Come here.
- I mean, to both of us.</i>

59:14.931 --> 59:17.024
Oh.

59:17.100 --> 59:19.364
Oh, yes. Oh, you're such a good boy.

59:19.436 --> 59:21.802
Another baby.

59:21.872 --> 59:26.309
I know. Honey, I think
I have to quit my job.

59:26.376 --> 59:28.469
You don't have to do that.
We can get some help.

59:28.545 --> 59:31.241
<i>I don't want any help.
I really don't.</i>

59:31.314 --> 59:33.248
I just don't-Will you hand me
that pacifier?

59:33.316 --> 59:36.479
- Yeah.
- I just- I don't want to be one of those people...

59:36.553 --> 59:39.989
that sees their child
for an hour at night.

59:40.056 --> 59:42.581
<i>- I don't.
- I know, but you love your work and-</i>

59:42.659 --> 59:44.889
I love my work, honey.
But this is killing me.

59:44.961 --> 59:48.658
<i>When I'm at the office,
I just wanna be here.</i>

59:48.732 --> 59:52.065
And when I'm here,
I am constantly thinking about work.

59:52.135 --> 59:54.968
And I just know that
I'm doing both jobs half- halfway.

59:55.038 --> 59:57.268
Well, you're not doing them halfway.

59:57.340 --> 59:59.399
<i>If I have to give up something...</i>

59:59.476 --> 01:00:02.741
I do not- I do not
want to give up this.

01:00:02.812 --> 01:00:05.610
<i>Why should I give you a raise?
Give me one good reason.</i>

01:00:05.682 --> 01:00:08.082
'Cause I'm doing a good job.

01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:10.142
- Is that a question?
- No.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.688
Since I took over the column,
the readership's doubled.

01:00:12.756 --> 01:00:14.815
So you are doing a good job.

01:00:14.891 --> 01:00:18.418
- Yes, if you go by circulation and popularity.
- Okay.

01:00:18.495 --> 01:00:22.693
- Why not make it permanent?
- What do you mean, like forever?

01:00:22.766 --> 01:00:25.530
Yeah, that's what permanent means.

01:00:25.602 --> 01:00:29.197
<i>John, every bozo out there
would like to have their own column.</i>

01:00:29.272 --> 01:00:31.297
Everybody in that entire room.

01:00:31.374 --> 01:00:34.832
And you've taken the column and
you've turned it into something fresh.

01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:38.642
I know you don't want to hear it,
but you're a really good columnist.

01:00:38.715 --> 01:00:41.707
<i>Why you hesitating?</i>

01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:44.811
I just have this idea about myself,
you know, as a reporter.

01:00:44.888 --> 01:00:48.688
Well, sometimes life comes up
with a better idea. I'll tell you what.

01:00:48.758 --> 01:00:52.216
You take on a daily column,
I will double your salary.

01:00:57.867 --> 01:01:00.495
<i>I'm so happy</i>

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:04.973
<i>'Cause today I found my friends</i>

01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:07.441
<i>They're in my head</i>

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:09.535
<i>I'm so ugly</i>

01:01:09.612 --> 01:01:13.378
<i>That's okay 'cause so are you</i>

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:15.918
<i>Broke our mirrors</i>

01:01:15.986 --> 01:01:18.011
<i>Sunday morning</i>

01:01:18.088 --> 01:01:22.582
<i>Is every day for all I care</i>

01:01:22.659 --> 01:01:26.720
<i>And I'm not scared
Light my candles</i>

01:01:26.796 --> 01:01:31.597
<i>In a daze 'cause I found God</i>

01:01:35.638 --> 01:01:39.631
I'll start you off with some corn flakes.
Most important meal-

01:01:39.709 --> 01:01:41.643
No. Marley.

01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:44.009
Most important meal of the day.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.014
There. Take a little-

01:01:46.082 --> 01:01:50.485
<i>John, please, just take him for a second.
I gotta shower. I gotta go.</i>

01:01:50.553 --> 01:01:54.990
- It happens every time.
- Well, you gotta spend more time with them.

01:01:55.058 --> 01:01:58.255
Down! Marley.

01:02:01.464 --> 01:02:04.092
Here we go. Oh, oh, oh.

01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:06.567
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
- No, no, I got it. It's fine.

01:02:06.636 --> 01:02:08.627
You say spend more time
with him, and I do it...

01:02:08.705 --> 01:02:11.299
and then you wanna take over
'cause you say I'm not doing it right.

01:02:11.374 --> 01:02:14.741
- I don't want you changing him when you're mad.
- I'm not mad! I'm-

01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:16.745
<i>Thank you. Come on.</i>

01:02:16.813 --> 01:02:18.906
Hi, baby. Hang on, honey.

01:02:18.982 --> 01:02:22.418
I know, baby. I know. I know.

01:02:22.485 --> 01:02:26.012
Oh, dear. Come on.
Come on. What?

01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:28.580
What's the matter?
What do you need, baby? What is it?

01:02:28.658 --> 01:02:32.116
Do you want some food? Food? Yeah?

01:02:32.195 --> 01:02:37.360
- No. Okay.
- He's just colicky, Jen. He'll grow out of it.

01:02:37.434 --> 01:02:42.804
Here's an idea. Why don't you stay home
and I'll go to work while he grows out of it.

01:02:42.872 --> 01:02:45.568
<i>Sorry. I'm tired.
Just go. Just go.</i>

01:02:45.642 --> 01:02:48.873
It's postpartum depression.
Their hormones go on tilt...

01:02:48.945 --> 01:02:50.913
and they get depressed.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.108
<i>I remember after my fourth kid was born,
I'd wake up in the middle of the night sometimes...</i>

01:02:54.184 --> 01:02:57.585
my wife would be there
staring at me...

01:02:57.654 --> 01:03:00.316
with a meat cleaver in her hand.

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:03.291
I thought she was gonna kill me.

01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:05.384
I still do.

01:03:05.462 --> 01:03:07.589
Did you get her the gift?

01:03:07.664 --> 01:03:11.464
<i>- Yeah.
- That usually works.</i>

01:03:11.534 --> 01:03:14.162
<i>Okay, Janice, make him look pretty.</i>

01:03:14.237 --> 01:03:17.263
He's gonna have this picture next
to his byline for the next 20 years.

01:03:58.781 --> 01:04:02.148
Patrick, honey, please stop doing that.
You're gonna make him sick.

01:04:02.218 --> 01:04:04.311
- Just eat it, okay?
- Careful, Patrick.

01:04:04.387 --> 01:04:07.379
Remember what we did
to Marley when he didn't listen.

01:04:07.457 --> 01:04:10.290
Honey, you know what else?
We really have to pick out a color fabric...

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.624
for the curtains in the boys' room.

01:04:12.695 --> 01:04:17.189
Okay, well, whatever you want. And then-

01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:20.430
I'd really like your help deciding.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.208
No. Let me get him.

01:04:26.276 --> 01:04:28.267
Thank you.

01:04:35.451 --> 01:04:38.045
Marley, just-

01:04:38.121 --> 01:04:42.251
<i>Marley, bad dog!
Marley! Marley, stop it!</i>

01:04:42.325 --> 01:04:45.226
Marley, let go! Let go.

01:04:45.295 --> 01:04:47.354
Marley. Marley.

01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:50.263
Marley! Marley, get back here!
Get back here!

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:52.563
Marley, bad dog!

01:04:52.635 --> 01:04:55.195
<i>Marley, get back here! Marley!</i>

01:04:55.271 --> 01:04:58.832
See, we were supposed to return these,
and now we have to pay for them.

01:04:58.908 --> 01:05:01.172
- That's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

01:05:01.244 --> 01:05:04.543
How many times have I told you not to
leave anything edible where he can get it?

01:05:04.614 --> 01:05:08.277
<i>- I know, but you wouldn't exactly say this is edible.
- John, you know what I mean.</i>

01:05:08.351 --> 01:05:12.651
You also said you would get up early and walk
him. He chews things when he gets restless.

01:05:12.722 --> 01:05:15.748
- I am gonna walk him. I just woke up.
- You know what? Forget it!

01:05:15.825 --> 01:05:18.123
- I'm gonna do it myself. Forget it!
- You don't have to.

01:05:18.194 --> 01:05:20.355
<i>Yes, I'm doing it myself.</i>

01:05:22.298 --> 01:05:24.858
You don't get it.
She's gonna kill you.

01:05:24.934 --> 01:05:29.769
You've got to take it easy.
We're both hanging by a thread.

01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:33.605
<i>- So who gets the dog if you guys split up?
- We're not splitting up.</i>

01:05:33.676 --> 01:05:36.076
- Out of the realm of possibility?
- Completely.

01:05:36.145 --> 01:05:40.980
There's nothing she can do? No tantrum
too big? No depression too deep?

01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:44.508
No failure to perform wifely duties
that would push you over the edge?

01:05:44.587 --> 01:05:48.819
Why do you jump right to splitting up?
Come on, buddy. Mend it, don't end it.

01:05:48.891 --> 01:05:52.327
- So life is better with Jenny than without her?
- Yes. What is-

01:05:52.395 --> 01:05:55.262
<i>Are you wearing a wire?
Jen, are you- She's listening to this.</i>

01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:58.459
<i>Jenny, yes, we had a fight,
but I still love you.</i>

01:05:58.534 --> 01:06:03.028
Come on, buddy. I had a fight
with my wife. Let me just sulk.

01:06:03.106 --> 01:06:05.506
I just wanna know
if you're really happy.

01:06:05.575 --> 01:06:08.100
Oh, wait. There she is.

01:06:08.177 --> 01:06:10.873
<i>- Who?
- Give me the kid.</i>

01:06:10.947 --> 01:06:13.814
No, I can't be a party to this.
That's-That's shameless.

01:06:13.883 --> 01:06:16.113
This is gonna be
even better than the puppy.

01:06:16.185 --> 01:06:18.278
No, not my son.

01:06:56.326 --> 01:06:58.920
Marley, no. Please, please, Marley.

01:06:58.995 --> 01:07:01.759
<i>Please.</i>

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:20.343
Marley! Marley, what are you-

01:07:22.518 --> 01:07:26.181
Marley, God, look at-
Stop it! Why do you do this?

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:28.780
Why do you ruin everything? Go on!

01:07:30.593 --> 01:07:34.051
Patrick! Are you okay? I'm sorry.

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:36.860
<i>Get that dog out of here.</i>

01:07:36.933 --> 01:07:39.561
- I want that dog out of here right now.
- I'll take him for a walk.

01:07:39.635 --> 01:07:41.694
I'm not kidding.
No, you take him to that farm.

01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:44.501
<i>All right, buddy, looks like
we're going to the farm again.</i>

01:07:44.574 --> 01:07:47.600
I'm serious. I'm not kidding. I want-
I can't take this anymore.

01:07:47.677 --> 01:07:49.907
- What did he do?
- Everything! What hasn't he done?

01:07:49.979 --> 01:07:52.277
He's just a horrible,
horrible animal.

01:07:52.348 --> 01:07:55.476
<i>- Well, that's a little unfair.
- No, what's unfair...</i>

01:07:55.551 --> 01:07:58.850
is that Conor hasn't slept in two weeks
because of that dog's barking...

01:07:58.921 --> 01:08:01.321
that Patrick gets
knocked down twice a day...

01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:03.325
<i>that I can't even think straight.</i>

01:08:03.393 --> 01:08:05.384
God forbid there's
a hint of thunder.

01:08:05.461 --> 01:08:07.395
- Just don't!
- Just calm down for a second.

01:08:07.463 --> 01:08:10.489
I know that it's been a rough couple of
months with the new baby and everything.

01:08:10.566 --> 01:08:13.763
I understand that.
But I was talking with Arnie.

01:08:13.836 --> 01:08:15.770
- And postpartum dep-
- Don't you dare.

01:08:15.838 --> 01:08:19.671
I am not depressed.
I am exhausted.

01:08:19.742 --> 01:08:22.267
<i>I'm not angry because of some condition.</i>

01:08:22.345 --> 01:08:24.939
I can't even go out
for an hour without the kids...

01:08:25.014 --> 01:08:27.983
because every babysitter in this
neighborhood is terrified of Marley.

01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:31.349
I know that, but you were the one that
said you didn't wanna work anymore.

01:08:31.421 --> 01:08:33.389
<i>- We can get help-
- I don't need any help!</i>

01:08:33.456 --> 01:08:35.390
- That makes it hard.
- Just get rid of the dog!

01:08:35.457 --> 01:08:37.653
- That's not gonna happen obviously.
- Please keep your voice down.

01:08:37.727 --> 01:08:40.752
- Me keep my voice down?
- Just do it. Just get rid of the dog!

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:42.798
Everybody gets rid of their dogs.
It's just a dog.

01:08:42.865 --> 01:08:46.028
And I'm just a husband. You gonna
get rid of me when I misbehave?

01:08:46.102 --> 01:08:48.036
- I've thought about it.
- Well, that makes two of us.

01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:50.504
- What do you have to complain about?
- What do I-

01:08:50.573 --> 01:08:53.599
- Because you're such a joy to be around?
- You're such a jerk.

01:08:53.676 --> 01:08:56.542
So nice to walk in the door,
feel like you're joining a chain gang.

01:08:56.612 --> 01:08:58.102
<i>Just a jerk!</i>

01:09:01.617 --> 01:09:04.881
Stop it! It's your fault.

01:09:04.953 --> 01:09:08.082
- You gotta be kidding me?
- Nope.

01:09:08.157 --> 01:09:11.490
<i>Just for a couple of days
till things cool down at home.</i>

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:15.898
A couple days will be all right.

01:09:15.965 --> 01:09:18.399
You guys know each other.
You'll be comfortable.

01:09:18.468 --> 01:09:22.700
- Want a beer?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks. Are you moving?

01:09:22.772 --> 01:09:25.434
<i>- Yeah.
- Where?</i>

01:09:25.508 --> 01:09:27.499
New York.

01:09:27.577 --> 01:09:31.411
<i>The Gray Lady came a-courtin'.</i>

01:09:31.481 --> 01:09:34.381
<i>The Times offered you
a permanent job?</i>

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:37.180
I gave Arnie my notice last week.

01:09:37.252 --> 01:09:40.381
<i>- You didn't say anything.
- I know. I'm sorry.</i>

01:09:40.456 --> 01:09:46.053
I just- It all happened so fast,
I'm not even used to the idea yet.

01:09:46.127 --> 01:09:49.894
<i>That's great. The New York Times.</i>

01:09:49.966 --> 01:09:52.696
It's what we always dreamed of.

01:09:56.138 --> 01:10:00.074
Well, congratulations.
I mean, you deserve it.

01:10:00.142 --> 01:10:03.600
- Yeah.
- Thanks for looking after Marley.

01:10:03.679 --> 01:10:06.045
- Yeah.
- He's eating your briefcase right now.

01:10:06.115 --> 01:10:08.777
<i>- Shit!
- Marley. Marley, no.</i>

01:10:08.851 --> 01:10:12.685
- Two days, John. I'm serious.
- Sorry.

01:10:16.359 --> 01:10:19.192
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

01:10:19.262 --> 01:10:21.127
I wasn't, uh, sleeping.

01:10:23.866 --> 01:10:27.802
<i>- Where's Marley?
- Sebastian's gonna watch him for a few days.</i>

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:30.634
Mm-hmm. I'd love to see that.

01:10:30.706 --> 01:10:35.905
<i>Just until I can find
a more permanent home.</i>

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.041
- This is his permanent home, John.
- Mmm.

01:10:41.117 --> 01:10:43.108
<i>Marley's not going anywhere.
Honey, I'm sorry.</i>

01:10:43.185 --> 01:10:45.881
I just got overwhelmed.

01:10:45.955 --> 01:10:50.824
<i>- No one tells you how hard this is all gonna be.
- Which part?</i>

01:10:50.893 --> 01:10:53.987
All of it:

01:10:54.063 --> 01:10:57.226
Marriage, being a parent.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:01.100
<i>It's the hardestjob in the world
and nobody prepares you for that.</i>

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:04.139
Nobody tells you how much
you have to give up.

01:11:04.206 --> 01:11:08.836
I feel like they do tell you,
but you don't listen...

01:11:08.911 --> 01:11:12.074
or you think, "Ah, they're just miserable. "

01:11:16.752 --> 01:11:20.313
I've given up so much
of what made me who I am.

01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:23.659
But I can't say that because...

01:11:23.726 --> 01:11:26.559
I'm a very bad person if I say that.

01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:31.022
But I feel it. I really do.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:35.560
I feel it sometimes. I just-

01:11:35.638 --> 01:11:37.833
I just want you to know that.

01:11:37.907 --> 01:11:41.775
I do know that.
And you can say it. I say it.

01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:44.972
But I did make a choice.

01:11:45.047 --> 01:11:49.848
I made a choice, and even
if it's harder than I thought...

01:11:49.919 --> 01:11:51.944
I don't regret it.

01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:54.148
- Are you sure?
- I am very sure.

01:11:54.223 --> 01:11:57.852
'Cause it kinda has like a
"there's no place like home" feeling to it.

01:11:57.927 --> 01:12:01.920
I just think these things are gonna happen
and we're gonna get through them.

01:12:01.998 --> 01:12:05.991
- And we'll just do it together.
- Together.

01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:14.041
- Getting rid of Marley is not gonna fix anything.
- No.

01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:18.638
And getting rid of you
isn't gonna fix anything either.

01:12:18.714 --> 01:12:20.648
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yes.

01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:23.378
No more kids for a while.

01:12:23.452 --> 01:12:26.250
Absolutely. Deal.

01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:34.422
Hi, guys.

01:12:34.497 --> 01:12:36.988
All right, say hello to Colleen.

01:12:37.066 --> 01:12:39.591
- Daddy says her name is Whoops.
- No, I-

01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:42.502
<i>- Patrick said that.
- What?</i>

01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:45.267
- Why did you say that?
- I was just kidding around.

01:12:45.341 --> 01:12:47.605
- It was kind of a secret, guys.
- Over here.

01:12:53.816 --> 01:12:56.910
The old pro moves back.
He looks for a little separation.

01:12:56.986 --> 01:12:59.250
Gets an assist from Colleen.

01:12:59.321 --> 01:13:01.949
Nice shot, Dad!

01:13:02.024 --> 01:13:04.515
Nice shot? Come on. Conor?

01:13:04.593 --> 01:13:07.187
- Extraordinary.
- Yeah. Again.

01:13:07.263 --> 01:13:10.255
<i>Wait. Let me get this. I'll be back.</i>

01:13:10.332 --> 01:13:13.859
<i>- All right.
- The knees are shot.</i>

01:13:15.371 --> 01:13:17.430
- Hello?
- John Grogan?

01:13:17.506 --> 01:13:19.497
Yes, it is.

01:13:19.575 --> 01:13:23.477
<i>- Gil Lawford from the Philadelphia Inquirer.
- Uh, yeah, yeah.</i>

01:13:25.514 --> 01:13:27.948
Hi. How are you?
Thanks for getting back to me.

01:13:29.051 --> 01:13:32.817
Oh! Hey, who was that on the phone?

01:13:32.888 --> 01:13:34.788
<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer.</i>

01:13:34.857 --> 01:13:38.588
I sent the editor some clips
a while back and he wants to meet.

01:13:38.661 --> 01:13:43.098
- What's a while back?
- He was down here on vacation a month ago.

01:13:43.165 --> 01:13:46.328
And he read my stuff.
And we kind of had lunch.

01:13:46.402 --> 01:13:50.065
<i>- How do you kind of have lunch?
- I didn't think anything was gonna come of it.</i>

01:13:50.139 --> 01:13:51.970
<i>Okay.</i>

01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:54.976
<i>- But?
- They offered me a job.</i>

01:13:55.044 --> 01:13:57.740
I mean, I have an interview.

01:13:57.813 --> 01:14:01.078
- As, like, a columnist or-
- As a reporter.

01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:03.641
<i>As a reporter?
Well, what did you say?</i>

01:14:03.719 --> 01:14:07.450
<i>I said, "Thank you very much,
but I'm happy here. "</i>

01:14:07.523 --> 01:14:11.323
<i>"Never have I heard someone
piss and moan as much as John Grogan.</i>

01:14:11.393 --> 01:14:13.486
If he doesn't like it here,
he should move. "

01:14:13.562 --> 01:14:16.190
That's part of my job
is to get a response.

01:14:16.265 --> 01:14:19.291
- I'm glad to see a little blood flowing from these people.
- No.

01:14:19.368 --> 01:14:23.270
- There's a recurring theme here.
- Recurring theme is we got a lot of cranks in Broward County.

01:14:23.339 --> 01:14:26.103
- That's what I'm up against.
- But what I'm trying to say, with all due respect...

01:14:26.175 --> 01:14:28.109
is that you are one of them!

01:14:28.177 --> 01:14:30.771
I'm a commentator.
Everyone wants me to act...

01:14:30.846 --> 01:14:32.871
<i>like everything's great,
when there are issues.</i>

01:14:32.948 --> 01:14:36.975
<i>There's overcrowding, there's crime,
there's racial tensions.</i>

01:14:37.052 --> 01:14:40.647
Every time you turn around there's a new
sky rise going up even uglier than the one-

01:14:40.723 --> 01:14:44.386
That goes on all over the world.
It's not Florida. It's you. What's wrong?

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:49.488
Nothing's wrong. Everyone wants to think,
"Oh, he's turning 40. He's become a curmudgeon. "

01:14:49.565 --> 01:14:52.728
That's not it. Maybe-

01:14:52.802 --> 01:14:56.568
I don't know. Maybe I'm sick of my column.

01:14:56.639 --> 01:15:00.473
I don't- I don't find the things
I'm saying that interesting.

01:15:00.543 --> 01:15:03.910
<i>John. John, you're the comic voice
of south Florida.</i>

01:15:03.979 --> 01:15:06.038
You're a national treasure,
for God's sakes.

01:15:06.115 --> 01:15:10.017
- Maybe a regional treasure.
- Well, a municipal treasure for sure.

01:15:10.085 --> 01:15:12.952
<i>- Thank you.
- Listen. Take a vacation. Go away for a couple weeks.</i>

01:15:13.022 --> 01:15:15.684
- Take a month off.
- Go where?

01:15:15.758 --> 01:15:19.694
- I don't know.
- I live in a vacation spot.

01:15:19.762 --> 01:15:23.493
Then go to someplace where it's painful and sad.

01:15:33.309 --> 01:15:38.212
Oh, 40's gonna be tough, buddy.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:15:40.082 --> 01:15:42.016
But we knew that.

01:15:42.084 --> 01:15:45.485
We knew this was when
Father Time was gonna make his move.

01:15:45.554 --> 01:15:48.717
Try to take us down a dark alley
and beat the hell out of us.

01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:52.557
You got a little more
white around the temple...

01:15:52.628 --> 01:15:56.394
but makes you look
more distinguished, I think.

01:15:56.465 --> 01:15:58.433
We both lost a step.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:01.230
I know.

01:16:01.303 --> 01:16:04.568
How does it feel to have
your best years behind you?

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.541
You do everything you wanted to?

01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.976
No, me neither.

01:16:12.248 --> 01:16:16.480
All right. You hot?
You wanna cool off? Let's do it.

01:16:21.223 --> 01:16:24.886
<i>You know what? Not today.</i>

01:16:26.262 --> 01:16:29.390
You've been on a leash
a little too long.

01:16:29.465 --> 01:16:32.127
Go! Go!

01:16:37.306 --> 01:16:39.638
I think he got a little bit
of a second wind.

01:16:50.419 --> 01:16:52.614
Go get it!

01:16:55.257 --> 01:16:58.420
<i>Happiness more or less</i>

01:16:58.494 --> 01:17:01.986
<i>It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty</i>

01:17:02.064 --> 01:17:06.433
<i>Oh, my, my</i>

01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:10.364
<i>Happiness, coming and going</i>

01:17:10.439 --> 01:17:13.840
<i>I watch you look at me
Watch my fever growing</i>

01:17:13.909 --> 01:17:18.141
<i>I knowjust where I am</i>

01:17:19.415 --> 01:17:24.944
<i>Well, I'm a lucky man</i>

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.147
<i>With fire in my hands</i>

01:17:27.222 --> 01:17:29.952
- Hey, get your dog!
- What?

01:17:36.565 --> 01:17:38.795
No! No! Please, God, no!

01:17:38.867 --> 01:17:42.894
<i>No! No! No! No.</i>

01:17:45.908 --> 01:17:48.468
Come on!

01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:51.536
Come here. Come here. That's okay.

01:17:51.613 --> 01:17:55.572
Dude, that was not cool.

01:17:55.651 --> 01:17:58.711
Come on, girl. Let's go.

01:18:02.891 --> 01:18:04.688
Great.

01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:09.891
Let's go.

01:18:12.968 --> 01:18:16.995
Man, you are the world's worst dog.

01:18:17.072 --> 01:18:19.131
You know that? Right?

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:21.642
You were top five
going into the day...

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:24.975
and with this little stunt,
you moved into number one.

01:18:25.047 --> 01:18:27.845
And I take my hat off to you.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.087
Surprise!

01:18:50.606 --> 01:18:54.007
Happy birthday to you

01:18:54.076 --> 01:18:59.480
Happy birthday, dearJohn

01:18:59.548 --> 01:19:04.679
Happy birthday to you

01:19:04.753 --> 01:19:08.120
Happy birthday.

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:13.628
You can help me. Hold on.
Hold on. On three. One, two, three.

01:19:21.303 --> 01:19:23.965
But don't beg, Marley.

01:19:24.039 --> 01:19:27.668
It's not good. 'Cause we don't have to.

01:19:29.611 --> 01:19:32.944
Tell me the truth.
Were you surprised?

01:19:33.015 --> 01:19:35.848
- Completely. Yes. Thank you.
- Really?

01:19:35.918 --> 01:19:40.082
- I was. You guys got me.
- We got you!

01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:42.589
Are you ready for
your birthday present?

01:19:42.658 --> 01:19:45.559
There's more? I don't need
any other presents.

01:19:50.232 --> 01:19:53.292
- Happy birthday.
- What was that?

01:19:53.368 --> 01:19:57.464
That was my blessing
to take that job in Philadelphia.

01:19:57.539 --> 01:20:00.633
That was months ago.
I'm not thinking about that.

01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:02.677
Well, then any other job.

01:20:02.744 --> 01:20:05.508
- We'll follow you wherever you wanna go.
- I understand.

01:20:05.581 --> 01:20:08.072
But I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna uproot us.

01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:10.983
We got our friends.
The kids enjoy school.

01:20:11.053 --> 01:20:13.146
And I got my poker game.
I couldn't possibly-

01:20:13.222 --> 01:20:17.158
First of all, it's just an interview.
You don't have the job yet.

01:20:17.226 --> 01:20:20.389
And second of all, honey,
you don't have any friends.

01:20:20.462 --> 01:20:24.193
That's right. I was wondering,
who were all those strangers tonight?

01:20:24.266 --> 01:20:26.530
<i>- I hired them.
- What I'm trying to say...</i>

01:20:26.602 --> 01:20:28.832
is our life is here
and I'm okay with that.

01:20:28.904 --> 01:20:31.964
<i>Our life is wherever
we are. That's it.</i>

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.974
<i>- And you're not happy here.
- That's not true.</i>

01:20:34.042 --> 01:20:37.500
You're not happy doing that column.
You're restless and I can feel it.

01:20:37.579 --> 01:20:41.310
<i>- I'm not- I'm not. - I feel it every
day that you read Sebastian's articles.</i>

01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:45.683
I feel it every time you sit an extra five
minutes in the driveway before you come in.

01:20:45.754 --> 01:20:47.688
<i>- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.</i>

01:20:47.756 --> 01:20:49.519
I'm checking on things in the car.

01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:53.550
- I just think it's time for a change.
- I'm 40,Jen.

01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:57.121
Maybe at 39, but I'm too- I don't know.

01:20:57.199 --> 01:21:00.726
- It feels a little late to be making big changes.
- No. No, no, no, no.

01:21:00.802 --> 01:21:03.236
- Uh-uh-uh-uh. No.
- What are you doing?

01:21:03.305 --> 01:21:06.069
We're not old, John.

01:21:09.912 --> 01:21:12.904
We can still surprise ourselves.

01:21:16.818 --> 01:21:21.585
See, most girls would do a swan dive, but
you know a cannonball is so much sexier.

01:21:24.993 --> 01:21:27.587
So you ready for your other
birthday present or what?

01:21:27.663 --> 01:21:29.688
Yes.

01:21:29.765 --> 01:21:33.861
It's like an embarrassment
of riches, this birthday.

01:21:33.936 --> 01:21:36.700
They just keep coming.
It's like Hanukkah.

01:21:44.546 --> 01:21:46.844
See, we're not old.

01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:57.281
<i>Grogan!</i>

01:22:05.834 --> 01:22:07.961
<i>Just wanna wish you
good luck up there.</i>

01:22:08.036 --> 01:22:13.736
Thanks. Yeah. It'll be good. I'm gonna
miss everybody. I'm gonna miss your laugh.

01:22:13.809 --> 01:22:18.303
Yeah. There was a good chance that every
piece of advice I ever gave you was a lot of crap.

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:22.817
- No, no, no. I appreciate it just the same.
- Well, at this point...

01:22:22.884 --> 01:22:27.844
a mushy guy would tell you he's proud of you,
give you a hug and send you on your way.

01:22:29.524 --> 01:22:32.960
Well, I'm glad you're not that guy, sir.

01:22:34.429 --> 01:22:36.420
All right. Okay.

01:22:38.267 --> 01:22:41.668
Grogan, just for the record,
you surprised the hell out of me.

01:22:41.737 --> 01:22:45.036
That's my specialty.

01:22:45.107 --> 01:22:47.405
<i>Walking down</i>

01:22:47.476 --> 01:22:51.913
<i>By the river</i>

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.778
<i>Water running</i>

01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:59.287
<i>Through my knees</i>

01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:02.255
<i>Oh, mighty river</i>

01:23:02.324 --> 01:23:05.919
<i>I would love to be like you</i>

01:23:05.994 --> 01:23:07.928
- Are we here yet?
- No.

01:23:07.996 --> 01:23:10.396
- Now?
- We got a couple hours to go.

01:23:10.465 --> 01:23:12.592
- Now?
- Soak it up.

01:23:12.668 --> 01:23:14.727
- Now? Are we here yet?
- Must be near it.

01:23:14.803 --> 01:23:17.169
Are we getting hot or cold?

01:23:17.239 --> 01:23:19.571
- Why are we turning into here?
- We're living here.

01:23:19.641 --> 01:23:24.374
- Whoa!
- I want a moment of silence just to take this in.

01:23:24.446 --> 01:23:28.940
Okay? Before the pandemonium.
Look at this.

01:23:29.017 --> 01:23:32.680
- Here we go.
- Come on. We're here.

01:23:39.761 --> 01:23:43.925
Marley! Marley, no!
Marley! Marley! Marley!

01:23:43.999 --> 01:23:46.331
- Oh, nice.
- And we're home.

01:23:53.108 --> 01:23:56.509
Hey, Andy Rooney, if you're knocking off soon,
I'll walk with you to the train.

01:23:56.578 --> 01:24:00.207
Okay, I'm ready.
Put an exclamation point here.

01:24:00.282 --> 01:24:04.343
Mark Twain said not to use exclamation points
'cause it's like laughing at your own joke...

01:24:04.419 --> 01:24:07.946
but sometimes you gotta laugh
at your own joke 'cause it's funny.

01:24:08.023 --> 01:24:12.460
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

01:24:12.527 --> 01:24:16.623
- It's here! Come on. Come on!
- Over here!

01:24:16.698 --> 01:24:19.132
It's here! It's here!
Come on! Marley!

01:24:19.201 --> 01:24:23.137
Come on. Look it!

01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:41.212
Whoa!

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:45.787
No, Marley!

01:24:45.861 --> 01:24:50.821
Remember, angels can fly,
so you gotta get the wings up high.

01:24:50.899 --> 01:24:53.629
Yeah. Now that one's coming.

01:24:53.702 --> 01:24:56.500
<i>- Lunch is ready!
- Okay!</i>

01:24:56.571 --> 01:24:59.734
- Heading in. Let's go.
- Take that!

01:24:59.808 --> 01:25:01.400
- Marley!
- Come on, guys.

01:25:01.476 --> 01:25:03.444
Marley, come on. Marley.

01:25:03.512 --> 01:25:07.312
You know what, honey?
Let him be. He's happy.

01:25:10.719 --> 01:25:12.653
Thank you.

01:25:32.908 --> 01:25:37.811
What are you doing in
here? You going for the bunk bed tonight?

01:25:37.879 --> 01:25:39.870
Pretty good day.

01:25:39.948 --> 01:25:42.542
<i>I mean, the snow. Come on.</i>

01:25:42.617 --> 01:25:45.450
All right. Sleep tight.

01:25:52.828 --> 01:25:54.955
<i>- Too much color?
- Yeah.</i>

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:59.433
I mean, don't get me wrong. It's a good
piece, but you're reporting now, John.

01:25:59.501 --> 01:26:01.992
I want you to tell the story.
I don't want you to be in the story.

01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:06.131
- I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself in there-
- The point is...

01:26:06.208 --> 01:26:08.142
I still feel you in there.

01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:10.838
And all I'm saying
is less you and more facts.

01:26:10.912 --> 01:26:14.006
Got it.

01:26:16.685 --> 01:26:19.313
- Door's always open.
- Thanks.

01:26:19.387 --> 01:26:21.378
Hut!

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:28.925
Uh-oh. Here comes the old pro.

01:26:28.997 --> 01:26:31.261
He shows up for the fourth quarter.

01:26:31.333 --> 01:26:34.427
Yeah. Oh, yes!

01:26:34.503 --> 01:26:37.836
He catches it. He fends off one guy.

01:26:37.906 --> 01:26:41.672
He's running through.
He's shaking tackles left and right.

01:26:41.743 --> 01:26:45.736
They can't take him down.
He's got too much- Oh!

01:26:45.814 --> 01:26:49.750
Grogan goes down!
Down goes Grogan.

01:26:49.818 --> 01:26:52.048
- You're home early.
- That's right.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.420
I had to come home and teach these kids
how to play football the right way.

01:26:56.491 --> 01:26:58.356
Okay.

01:26:58.426 --> 01:27:02.021
- Okay, guys, seriously, dinner's in an hour.
- Okay.

01:27:02.097 --> 01:27:05.464
I want you to finish your homework and
take off those shoes before you come in.

01:27:05.534 --> 01:27:07.525
<i>- Yeah, take off your shoes!
- Okay.</i>

01:27:07.602 --> 01:27:11.129
Got him down. Got him down.
Got him down. Got him down.

01:27:11.907 --> 01:27:13.875
Ow.

01:27:15.277 --> 01:27:17.472
My God.

01:27:17.546 --> 01:27:21.038
I come home and
it's like I got mugged.

01:27:21.116 --> 01:27:23.311
Okay.

01:27:25.153 --> 01:27:28.645
<i>- Come on.
- What's wrong with him, Dad?</i>

01:27:28.723 --> 01:27:32.386
Nothing's wrong.
He's just... tired. Right, Dad?

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:35.918
Yeah. The football
took it out of him.

01:27:37.365 --> 01:27:39.230
Let's go.

01:27:39.467 --> 01:27:41.799
I don't know. I just don't understand.

01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:45.135
Ayear ago, you couldn't wait
to be done with your column.

01:27:45.206 --> 01:27:50.303
I know. But now I got this guy going through
every sentence with a fine-tooth comb.

01:27:50.378 --> 01:27:53.347
<i>I gotta admit, sometimes I miss
the freedom where I couldjust-</i>

01:27:53.415 --> 01:27:57.784
- What?
- It's just- It's exhausting sometimes, John.

01:27:57.852 --> 01:28:01.618
<i>You always wanting something
that you don't have.</i>

01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:04.352
Are you happy?

01:28:04.426 --> 01:28:06.860
I mean, none of this
was part of the plan.

01:28:06.928 --> 01:28:10.659
No. No, it wasn't part of the plan.

01:28:10.732 --> 01:28:13.599
<i>But it's so much better.</i>

01:28:13.668 --> 01:28:17.297
I'm just sort of done making plans.

01:28:17.372 --> 01:28:20.705
Marley! Oh, gross.

01:28:20.775 --> 01:28:24.336
Hmm, seems like somebody
needs to go out. Whoo!

01:28:24.412 --> 01:28:26.642
All right. Marley.

01:28:26.715 --> 01:28:29.377
<i>Come on. Come on, boy.</i>

01:28:31.252 --> 01:28:33.311
Oh, come on.

01:28:33.388 --> 01:28:36.289
Now it's really coming down.

01:28:41.396 --> 01:28:44.832
Marley? Marley?

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.959
Where'd he go? Marley?

01:28:49.838 --> 01:28:51.806
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:28:51.873 --> 01:28:55.604
- He's not coming back.
- Marley?

01:28:55.677 --> 01:28:58.771
Well, he couldn't have gone far. Marley?

01:28:59.781 --> 01:29:02.045
I'll come with you. Hold on.

01:29:03.385 --> 01:29:06.354
- Marley? I don't know where he could have gone.
- Marley?

01:29:06.421 --> 01:29:10.323
Well, maybe he went
next door again in the barn.

01:29:10.392 --> 01:29:14.488
- I'll check in the woodshed.
- Okay.

01:29:14.562 --> 01:29:16.553
Marley?

01:29:21.970 --> 01:29:24.768
Marley?

01:29:24.839 --> 01:29:28.935
Marley? Oh, Marley.

01:29:30.512 --> 01:29:33.106
- Did you see anything?
- No, nothing.

01:29:38.319 --> 01:29:42.187
- I gotta go talk to them.
- Okay.

01:29:43.892 --> 01:29:46.122
Wow, it's pouring out there.

01:29:46.194 --> 01:29:48.685
- Did you find him?
- You know what?

01:29:48.763 --> 01:29:53.791
He's out exploring.
You know how he loves the woods.

01:29:56.871 --> 01:30:01.604
Bobby says dogs, when they're
gonna die, they go away to do it.

01:30:01.676 --> 01:30:03.701
That's what his beagle did.

01:30:03.778 --> 01:30:07.578
Mmm. Well, you know,
that's true for beagles.

01:30:07.649 --> 01:30:10.743
But, uh, not Labs like Marley.

01:30:10.819 --> 01:30:14.311
<i>He's just out causing trouble.
Don't worry.</i>

01:30:14.389 --> 01:30:17.051
Okay, now, you finished
with your homework?

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:18.717
- Yep.
- Nope.

01:30:18.793 --> 01:30:21.489
<i>Nope? Well, let's make that a "yep. "</i>

01:30:21.563 --> 01:30:24.293
Come on now.

01:30:28.503 --> 01:30:32.098
Marley! Marley!

01:30:33.908 --> 01:30:37.571
Marley!

01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:44.481
<i>Marley.</i>

01:30:46.054 --> 01:30:50.150
Marley. Ah, Marley. You okay?

01:30:53.661 --> 01:30:56.926
Stay there.

01:30:56.998 --> 01:31:01.867
Why did his stomach twist? We don't
exactly know why this happens.

01:31:01.936 --> 01:31:06.600
Most likely he ate or drank something
quickly and his stomach just flipped.

01:31:06.674 --> 01:31:09.939
<i>I did manage to get a tube
down there to relieve some of the gas.</i>

01:31:10.011 --> 01:31:13.469
<i>- I think I untwisted it.
- He seems okay.</i>

01:31:13.548 --> 01:31:16.540
For now, he's good.

01:31:16.618 --> 01:31:20.145
The problem is that once this happens,
it almost always happens again.

01:31:20.221 --> 01:31:23.622
<i>And if it does, I don't know what
I'm gonna be able to do for him.</i>

01:31:23.691 --> 01:31:27.787
He's an older dog. I honestly don't think
he would survive the surgery.

01:31:27.862 --> 01:31:30.729
Well, we have to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

01:31:30.799 --> 01:31:33.859
Well, most likely,
it is gonna happen again.

01:31:33.935 --> 01:31:37.996
Well, we also talked about that maybe
he ate too fast or drank too quickly.

01:31:38.072 --> 01:31:41.166
- Right.
- So maybe it doesn't have to happen again.

01:31:41.242 --> 01:31:43.574
We'll monitor that.

01:31:43.645 --> 01:31:47.513
I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourself
that he may not make it through the night.

01:31:50.118 --> 01:31:53.918
Maybe 10%% of dogs
survive this kind of a thing.

01:31:53.988 --> 01:31:57.389
What-What is that number based on?

01:31:57.458 --> 01:32:00.859
- What is it based on?
- Yeah, the reason why I ask...

01:32:00.929 --> 01:32:03.955
is I bet that number's
based on regular dogs.

01:32:04.032 --> 01:32:07.900
- Regular dogs?
- Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs.

01:32:07.969 --> 01:32:10.870
<i>I know people probably say that
all the time, but to be honest...</i>

01:32:10.939 --> 01:32:13.203
I'm not sure he really is a dog.

01:32:13.274 --> 01:32:16.243
<i>He once ate an answering machine.
Just polished it off.</i>

01:32:16.311 --> 01:32:20.714
He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested
it. Then went and had the phone for dessert.

01:32:20.782 --> 01:32:24.912
<i>Another time, my son had colic and
this guy sat up all night, didn't move...</i>

01:32:24.986 --> 01:32:28.513
just stayed right there for nine hours
just keeping an eye on Conor.

01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:33.050
So I think maybe that
the number applies to regular dogs.

01:32:33.127 --> 01:32:36.494
<i>- But not to him.
- Well, you got a fighter here.</i>

01:32:36.564 --> 01:32:38.555
Let's hope for the best.

01:32:38.633 --> 01:32:41.158
I know he's gonna be okay.

01:32:41.236 --> 01:32:44.399
I'll see you in the morning.

01:33:04.225 --> 01:33:06.989
<i>- Oh, hi.
- Hey.</i>

01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:09.529
They're gonna-They're gonna
keep him overnight.

01:33:09.597 --> 01:33:12.327
But he seemed better when I left.

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:15.665
The vet really seemed on top of it.

01:33:17.939 --> 01:33:21.875
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. What are you reading?

01:33:21.943 --> 01:33:24.275
I'm reading your old columns.

01:33:27.148 --> 01:33:29.548
Marley's in so many of them.

01:33:29.617 --> 01:33:31.710
You still look at those?

01:33:31.786 --> 01:33:33.811
Yeah, I do sometimes.

01:33:35.957 --> 01:33:38.926
Even on the crappiest days-

01:33:38.993 --> 01:33:44.056
the kids are driving me nuts,
laundry's not done...

01:33:44.132 --> 01:33:46.896
and a hundred other things are wrong-

01:33:46.968 --> 01:33:49.562
I always know that I have this.

01:33:51.539 --> 01:33:54.702
It's five minutes of you.

01:33:54.776 --> 01:33:59.907
Sometimes they're sad
and sometimes they're really funny...

01:33:59.981 --> 01:34:04.213
silly or whatever,
but- but they're all you.

01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:08.488
And for those five minutes...

01:34:08.556 --> 01:34:11.024
you make me feel better.

01:34:24.739 --> 01:34:27.765
You should read them.
They're pretty great.

01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:31.874
Might even make a nice book.

01:34:31.946 --> 01:34:35.279
- A book?
- Something.

01:34:50.665 --> 01:34:52.656
Hello?

01:34:54.469 --> 01:34:57.199
All right. Thank you.

01:34:58.673 --> 01:35:01.107
He's coming home.

01:35:11.786 --> 01:35:13.811
Is he there?

01:35:13.888 --> 01:35:17.085
Of course he's there.
He's always there.

01:35:17.158 --> 01:35:22.061
- How does he know we're coming?
- I don't know. He just knows.

01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:24.257
Dogs know stuff like that.

01:35:24.332 --> 01:35:27.199
- All dogs?
- All good dogs.

01:35:27.268 --> 01:35:30.897
<i>- Look, there he is! There he is! Marley.
- Yeah.</i>

01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:37.735
Hi, Marley.

01:35:37.812 --> 01:35:39.746
- Marley.
- How you doin', Marley.

01:35:39.814 --> 01:35:42.977
- I missed you at school.
- I'll race you to the house.

01:35:43.051 --> 01:35:45.383
- Okay.
- Go!

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:55.393
<i>- Eagles?
- Yeah, the Eagles are going all the way.</i>

01:35:55.463 --> 01:35:57.590
I guarantee you.
What are you, a Dolphins fan?

01:35:57.665 --> 01:35:59.929
- No.
- John Grogan!

01:36:00.001 --> 01:36:02.970
- Hey. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, dude. See you tomorrow.

01:36:03.037 --> 01:36:06.234
<i>I said to myself, "That sorry
son of a bitch looks likeJohn Grogan. "</i>

01:36:06.307 --> 01:36:11.574
- What are you doing here? - Ah, story.
D.A.'s showing off the new field office and-

01:36:11.646 --> 01:36:14.706
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Man, it is good to see you.

01:36:14.782 --> 01:36:17.080
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:20.177
- So you living in the city somewhere?
- I live just outside of town.

01:36:20.254 --> 01:36:22.984
- More space for the kids.
- What do you got, like five now?

01:36:23.057 --> 01:36:27.323
Three. Here. Show you a little
snapshot of the Grogan brood.

01:36:28.663 --> 01:36:31.359
- Wow, Jen's holding up.
- Yeah.

01:36:31.432 --> 01:36:33.832
Thanks, I think.

01:36:33.901 --> 01:36:36.028
I see you-you finally
got a little girl, huh?

01:36:36.104 --> 01:36:39.130
<i>Colleen. She arrived after you left.</i>

01:36:39.207 --> 01:36:43.234
- What's with the ladybug getup?
- That was for her school play in preschool.

01:36:43.311 --> 01:36:46.940
And then we couldn't get her out of
her costume for, like, a month afterwards.

01:36:47.014 --> 01:36:49.847
And the reason why Marley
looks like he's biting her head...

01:36:49.917 --> 01:36:52.545
<i>is because the antennas on it-
he went ballistic.</i>

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:55.817
- Things don't change.
- That's right.

01:36:58.192 --> 01:37:02.458
- I wish I didn't have this interview.
- That's okay. I gotta get home.

01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:04.725
Conor's got a soccer game.

01:37:04.799 --> 01:37:07.233
All right. Well, one of these days
we gotta catch up.

01:37:07.301 --> 01:37:10.293
Yeah, let's do that.
We'll catch up one of these days.

01:37:10.371 --> 01:37:13.932
- Well, it was, uh, good to see you.
- Come here. Good to see you.

01:37:14.008 --> 01:37:16.806
- GiveJenny my best, okay?
- I will.

01:37:16.878 --> 01:37:18.971
- Oh, uh, here. Here.
- Oh, yeah.

01:37:19.046 --> 01:37:22.482
That's, uh-That's a great picture, John.

01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:25.644
- You did okay.
- Thanks.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.816
- You did okay too. I'll see ya.
- I'll see ya.

01:37:29.891 --> 01:37:32.451
I think you'll like the next one better.

01:37:32.527 --> 01:37:34.586
<i>Really?</i>

01:37:34.662 --> 01:37:38.758
Don't do it to yourself. We're in Philly.
Let's get a cheesesteak. Hi.

01:37:38.833 --> 01:37:42.200
<i>- Sebastian. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

01:37:45.907 --> 01:37:47.898
Hello?

01:37:53.014 --> 01:37:54.948
Is anybody home?

01:38:00.054 --> 01:38:03.421
Marley. Hey, Marley.
Marley. Marley.

01:38:03.491 --> 01:38:06.756
Hey. Hey. Marley. Marley.

01:38:06.827 --> 01:38:09.591
Marley.

01:38:09.664 --> 01:38:11.757
You didn't hear me, did you?

01:38:11.832 --> 01:38:15.632
I just caught you
in a senior moment there, Marley.

01:38:15.703 --> 01:38:19.935
All right, let's go for a walk.
Come on. Let's go.

01:38:31.852 --> 01:38:34.878
Come on. Come on.

01:38:34.956 --> 01:38:37.015
You're almost to the top.

01:38:37.091 --> 01:38:39.082
You know what? Come here.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.594
This is a good spot right here.

01:38:50.605 --> 01:38:55.099
I know you're a strong boy,
but you're gonna let me know, right?

01:38:55.176 --> 01:38:58.009
You know, when it's time.

01:38:58.079 --> 01:39:01.276
I don't wanna make
that decision on my own.

01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:05.783
You let me know
when you're ready, okay?

01:39:10.191 --> 01:39:12.125
All right.

01:39:21.002 --> 01:39:22.936
<i>Marley?</i>

01:39:24.605 --> 01:39:27.165
There he is.

01:39:27.241 --> 01:39:30.039
Marley.

01:39:30.111 --> 01:39:33.171
Ah, honey, what are you
doing down here?

01:39:33.247 --> 01:39:37.343
It's time to head upstairs.
You don't sleep down here.

01:39:37.418 --> 01:39:41.320
Come on. Can you make it upstairs?

01:39:43.758 --> 01:39:46.659
I think he's pretty
comfortable down here.

01:39:48.129 --> 01:39:51.223
- I'll get him a blanket.
- You all right?

01:39:56.771 --> 01:40:00.207
Lay down here for a second.

01:40:00.274 --> 01:40:02.765
Take a load off.

01:40:04.712 --> 01:40:09.206
Yeah. It's actually nice down here.

01:40:09.283 --> 01:40:11.376
This might be better.

01:40:15.389 --> 01:40:17.789
- It'd be twice a week, 600 words.
- And what's the subject?

01:40:17.858 --> 01:40:21.453
You know, everyday stuff.
The stuff we all go through, but funnier.

01:40:21.529 --> 01:40:24.362
I don't get it, John. I thought
you came here to be a reporter.

01:40:24.432 --> 01:40:26.662
I know I did, but I think
we both know that isn't me.

01:40:26.734 --> 01:40:29.726
<i>- I'm a columnist- a good one.
- Excuse me, John.</i>

01:40:29.804 --> 01:40:33.535
- Your wife's on the phone. She said it's important.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

01:40:33.607 --> 01:40:36.371
Think about it. Possible?

01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:39.345
- Thanks. Hello?
- You're welcome.

01:40:39.413 --> 01:40:41.847
I can't get him to come back inside.

01:40:41.916 --> 01:40:46.683
<i>He's just laying out there
in the cold and he won't move.</i>

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.728
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

01:41:01.802 --> 01:41:04.270
Patrick came home.
We got him here.

01:41:04.338 --> 01:41:09.901
Dr. Platt said that if he's comfortable,
leave him for a while and see, but...

01:41:09.977 --> 01:41:12.741
he's just not getting better.

01:41:15.883 --> 01:41:18.113
All right, I'm gonna take him in.

01:41:19.754 --> 01:41:22.882
<i>- Is he sick again?
- Yeah, he is, honey.</i>

01:41:22.957 --> 01:41:25.084
He doesn't feel too good.

01:41:25.159 --> 01:41:28.151
But I'm gonna take him into the doctor
and they're gonna try to make him feel better.

01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:30.561
It's all right, Marley.
You're gonna be okay.

01:41:36.036 --> 01:41:41.064
You could take Lamby,
but don't chew her other ear off.

01:41:41.142 --> 01:41:43.633
<i>That's sweet, honey.</i>

01:41:43.711 --> 01:41:45.770
Here, I'll take it.

01:41:49.049 --> 01:41:51.074
Good-bye.

01:42:34.862 --> 01:42:36.955
Okay.

01:43:00.054 --> 01:43:03.990
I've tried everything I did last time
that worked, but I'm not having any luck.

01:43:04.058 --> 01:43:07.152
Not able to get the tube down there.

01:43:07.228 --> 01:43:11.062
The stomach is still twisted.
There's still surgery, but-

01:43:11.131 --> 01:43:14.362
He's not strong enough.

01:43:23.344 --> 01:43:26.472
- I like this one the best.
- Which one?

01:43:26.547 --> 01:43:28.879
Oh, the mangoes. Yeah.

01:43:28.949 --> 01:43:32.441
Hello?

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.681
Hey, it's me.

01:43:34.755 --> 01:43:37.451
So, it's his stomach again.

01:43:37.525 --> 01:43:41.791
- And they could do surgery, but-
- I know.

01:43:41.862 --> 01:43:46.731
Do you want me to come down there?

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:49.701
No, no, I think it's a good idea
to stay with the kids...

01:43:49.770 --> 01:43:52.068
and be with them.

01:43:52.139 --> 01:43:56.633
I'm just gonna-

01:44:03.651 --> 01:44:05.619
I love you, John.

01:44:06.987 --> 01:44:08.978
I love you.

01:44:14.061 --> 01:44:16.894
- All right.
- I'm gonna give you some time.

01:44:16.964 --> 01:44:19.194
- Okay.
- And I'll be right outside if you need me.

01:44:19.266 --> 01:44:21.257
All right. Thanks.

01:44:23.237 --> 01:44:27.401
Look what I got for you.
Remember this?

01:44:27.474 --> 01:44:32.878
What did Colleen say to you?
You remember that?

01:44:32.947 --> 01:44:36.348
You remember chewing up that ear?

01:44:36.417 --> 01:44:40.581
Well, it's tough to remember
all the things you've chewed up, isn't it?

01:44:40.654 --> 01:44:43.350
It all starts to kind of run together.

01:45:17.558 --> 01:45:20.391
It's okay. You don't have to do anything.

01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:25.824
You don't have your usual energy.

01:45:25.899 --> 01:45:29.858
You remember how we were
always saying what a pain you are-

01:45:29.937 --> 01:45:32.428
that you're the world's worst dog?

01:45:34.108 --> 01:45:36.133
Don't believe it.

01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:38.542
Don't believe any
of it for a minute.

01:45:38.612 --> 01:45:42.070
'Cause you know
we couldn't find a better dog.

01:45:44.885 --> 01:45:48.048
You know what made you
such a... great dog-

01:45:48.122 --> 01:45:52.115
is you loved us every day,
no matter what.

01:45:52.192 --> 01:45:54.217
That's an amazing thing.

01:45:54.294 --> 01:45:57.730
You know how much we love you?

01:45:57.798 --> 01:45:59.993
We love you so much.

01:46:03.804 --> 01:46:06.295
I love you more than anything.

01:46:07.708 --> 01:46:12.771
I don't know exactly
where we go from here...

01:46:12.846 --> 01:46:16.577
but I want you to remember
you're a great dog, Marley.

01:46:16.650 --> 01:46:19.642
You're a great dog.

01:46:31.298 --> 01:46:33.892
<i>He won't feel this. He'll just slip away.</i>

01:46:33.967 --> 01:46:35.958
You ready?

01:46:38.605 --> 01:46:40.698
<i>- Yeah, we're ready.
- Okay.</i>

01:48:44.531 --> 01:48:47.557
Okay. Get down.

01:48:53.073 --> 01:48:56.770
<i>- He's wrapped in his blanket.
- So he can stay warm.</i>

01:48:56.844 --> 01:48:59.904
Do you guys wanna read
what you wrote?

01:49:01.782 --> 01:49:03.807
Mine's a picture of me and Marley...

01:49:03.884 --> 01:49:06.512
grasshoppers and ice cream.

01:49:06.587 --> 01:49:08.578
Mommy wrote what I said.

01:49:08.655 --> 01:49:14.059
<i>"Dear Marley, I will
never forget you forever. Colleen. "</i>

01:49:14.127 --> 01:49:16.891
And these are kisses.

01:49:16.964 --> 01:49:19.592
<i>- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.</i>

01:49:19.666 --> 01:49:22.533
You wanna put it in?
He'll like that.

01:49:22.603 --> 01:49:24.867
<i>Set it down.</i>

01:49:26.273 --> 01:49:28.207
Good.

01:49:28.275 --> 01:49:32.143
That's a great picture.
Conor, do you wanna-

01:49:35.582 --> 01:49:38.449
"Dear Marley, I loved you all my life.

01:49:38.518 --> 01:49:41.783
"I hope you like heaven
and that there's lots to chew on.

01:49:41.855 --> 01:49:45.313
<i>Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan. "</i>

01:49:48.862 --> 01:49:51.626
<i>That was a good letter.</i>

01:49:51.698 --> 01:49:54.895
Patrick, do you wanna say something?

01:49:56.203 --> 01:49:59.138
He knows.

01:50:02.242 --> 01:50:04.904
I'd like to give him something.

01:50:11.218 --> 01:50:13.209
This necklace.

01:50:15.055 --> 01:50:17.922
It's been on quite a journey.

01:50:24.131 --> 01:50:27.692
Your dad gave it to me...

01:50:27.768 --> 01:50:31.101
to celebrate the beginning
of our family.

01:50:31.171 --> 01:50:34.038
But, you know-

01:50:34.107 --> 01:50:36.871
Our family had really already begun.

01:50:43.617 --> 01:50:45.710
Bye, Clearance Puppy.

01:51:13.113 --> 01:51:15.274
<i>A dog has no use for fancy cars...</i>

01:51:15.349 --> 01:51:18.546
<i>or big homes or designer clothes.</i>

01:51:18.618 --> 01:51:22.054
<i>A waterlogged stick
will dojust fine.</i>

01:51:22.122 --> 01:51:24.784
<i>A dog doesn't care
if you're rich or poor...</i>

01:51:24.858 --> 01:51:28.259
<i>clever or dull, smart or dumb.</i>

01:51:28.328 --> 01:51:31.661
<i>Give 'em your heart
and he'll give you his.</i>

01:51:37.738 --> 01:51:40.673
<i>How many people
can you say that about?</i>

01:51:40.741 --> 01:51:45.508
<i>How many people can make you
feel rare and pure and special?</i>

01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:55.515
<i>How many people can
make you feel... extraordinary?</i>
