00:25.458 --> 00:26.686
The man is dead.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.489
Don't know much about
this business, do you?

00:28.561 --> 00:30.722
Had to have at least
450 horsepower.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.766
What keeps us from being
Grebs' next accident?

00:33.833 --> 00:35.824
You've hired a brand new
head of security.

00:39.005 --> 00:42.805
By forcing Grebs' hand, we have
placed ourselves in a state of war.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.504
This isn't business anymore.
This is personal.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.325
Knight Rider...

01:06.399 --> 01:09.857
a shadowy flight into the
dangerous world of a man...

01:10.370 --> 01:11.962
who does not exist.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.078
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.148 --> 01:24.673
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.751 --> 01:26.810
the helpless, the powerless...

01:26.886 --> 01:30.287
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:59.479 --> 03:00.844
What the... Hey!

03:32.912 --> 03:34.379
What are you doing?

03:42.155 --> 03:43.520
Don't!

04:34.207 --> 04:37.870
It's done. I'll be stopping by
for payment in the morning.

04:57.764 --> 05:00.631
All right!
You call that all right?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.725
That player on the bottom
may never get up.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.599
Hey, KITT, come on,
give me a break.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.901
It's the first hockey game
you've ever seen in your life.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.807
The similarity of hockey and a war
between various caveman tribes...

05:10.877 --> 05:13.903
on a frozen lake
bears a very close parallel.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.111
Are you sure you're
not becoming a bit of a snob?

05:19.585 --> 05:21.985
Snob? Who are you
calling a snob?

05:22.121 --> 05:24.055
Good morning, Devon.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.422
Do you know where
that word "snob" comes from?

05:27.493 --> 05:30.155
Yes, I do. And if I were a
snob, I would not allow you to...

05:30.229 --> 05:33.960
watch sports contests on
state-of-the-art Foundation equipment.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.091
Good morning.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.332
I'm on my way in.
Good.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.805
You've been rather difficult to
reach lately, particularly last night.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.137
I got a weakness
for dancers.

05:45.278 --> 05:49.738
Dancers pirouette on their toes to
the strains of violins and flutes.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.080
They do not gesticulate wildly
to the throbbing beat...

05:53.152 --> 05:54.949
of bongo drums and saxophones.

05:55.388 --> 05:59.654
Devon, they are innocent girls
working their way through college.

06:02.261 --> 06:04.491
Besides, every once in a
while, I gotta get away...

06:04.564 --> 06:05.826
Away from whom?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.667
I just gotta get away, period.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.670
This subject is closed,
for now.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.897
Michael, do you feel the need
to get away from me?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.566
No, KITT, no, I...

06:17.076 --> 06:20.842
What I meant was, I just gotta get
away, you know, the human condition...

06:20.913 --> 06:23.108
I gotta take a break,
get away from life.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.416
You and me, we're partners,
aren't we? Thank you, Michael.

06:26.486 --> 06:27.510
You're welcome.

06:38.998 --> 06:42.559
Two accidents with a connection
is one thing, but three in a row...

06:42.635 --> 06:45.069
lead me to believe that there's
a great deal more involved...

06:45.138 --> 06:46.264
than mere coincidence.

06:46.773 --> 06:47.899
What about the police?

06:48.007 --> 06:51.340
Incidents occurred in three different
jurisdictions in two different states.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.276
There's no reason
for them to make a connection.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.643
But you made a connection.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.580
They were all successfully
involved in the garment industry.

06:57.717 --> 07:00.618
Okay, so that's the pattern.
What's the motive?

07:00.686 --> 07:01.744
Extortion.

07:01.854 --> 07:04.186
I see you haven't lost
your street instincts.

07:04.390 --> 07:05.982
I have some evidence...

07:06.058 --> 07:08.219
and a great deal more
speculative information that...

07:08.294 --> 07:09.386
that's exactly what it is.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.089
Any speculation
on who's behind it?

07:11.164 --> 07:12.927
Yes, D.G. Grebs.

07:13.332 --> 07:15.926
Enormously well-organized
and absolutely deadly.

07:17.637 --> 07:18.934
There he is.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.830
He buys his muscle men
at group rates.

07:21.941 --> 07:25.069
He uses the garment industry
to clean up his money.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.044
He's got
a legitimate cash flow.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.013
At Harvard, they call it
vertical integrity.

07:29.081 --> 07:31.140
On the street, they
call it monopoly. Really?

07:31.517 --> 07:34.418
Total control through force.
That's Grebs' game.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.751
KITT has it all, including
a list of the businesses...

07:36.823 --> 07:39.087
Grebs already has
under control.

07:39.158 --> 07:42.150
I'm gonna make sure
we really do have a murderer.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.036
Another accident,
another statistic.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.638
Homicide goes about its business
and the Traffic Detail gets the heat.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.907
You know something? In New York,
anything darker than pale was a tan.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.374
But out here, you have to cook yourself
for a couple of hours each day...

08:04.450 --> 08:06.543
otherwise, you look like
an outpatient.

08:08.387 --> 08:09.820
You did a good job.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.580
Let's have a drink on it.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.852
No, thank you.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.997
To your health and your tan.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.140
You know where
to reach me in the future.

08:34.212 --> 08:36.078
The future? I need you now.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.284
Sorry, I have an appointment
in New Orleans, a new client.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.482
I'll buy it.
Put a number on it.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.320
There is no price
on my reputation.

08:44.557 --> 08:48.015
So what's it gonna cost me for
a delay, $20,000? You got it.

08:48.628 --> 08:52.758
Call it holding money for the next job,
not part of your regular fee, how's that?

08:54.267 --> 08:57.703
Okay, I can arrange that,
but for one week only.

08:58.404 --> 08:59.530
Good. Good.

09:00.506 --> 09:03.532
That should just about tie
this whole thing up for me.

09:03.743 --> 09:07.736
I got everything covered, from
trucking to fabric supply...

09:08.080 --> 09:10.275
right on down to the buttons.

09:10.349 --> 09:14.251
All I need now is a few successful
fashion houses in the sportswear business.

09:14.854 --> 09:16.981
They run the largest
cash flow.

09:17.056 --> 09:21.618
You seem to have everything under control.
You could be wasting your money on me.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.126
Money? That's easy.

09:24.964 --> 09:29.799
All I do is raise the interest on the
money they borrow to make their fall line.

09:30.002 --> 09:30.991
Yeah...

09:31.070 --> 09:34.471
I'm also the largest factor
in this area. Loan shark.

09:35.808 --> 09:39.767
Factor. It's legitimate.
I even pay some taxes.

09:43.115 --> 09:46.676
I'll be in touch.
For $20,000, you'd better.

09:48.955 --> 09:52.891
I have an offer out to O & M
Fashions, some guy named O'Malley.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.290
If he says yes,
go to New Orleans.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.724
If he says no, be in touch.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.411
What's taking so long, KITT?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.740
It's definitely
two different sets of tires.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.010
The second set
overlapping the first.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.775
Sam Dennis was
forced off the road.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.988
I need more.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.824
What can you tell me
about the other car?

10:27.560 --> 10:30.586
Considering the weight of the
sports car and its trajectory...

10:30.663 --> 10:33.291
I would say it exceeded
100 miles per hour...

10:33.366 --> 10:36.130
and had to have at least
450 horsepower.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.066
It overcame an excellent
braking system...

10:38.137 --> 10:40.469
in order to shove
the sports car off the cliff.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.575
Then this M.O. fits
the other accidents.

10:44.543 --> 10:48.536
What we have here is a series of
murders, cleverly disguised murders.

10:49.081 --> 10:52.881
All right, tap into your data banks.
We've got to narrow down the field.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.551
KITT, give me a list of all
the companies and owners...

11:03.629 --> 11:05.790
coming out
with a new fall line.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.922
It's rather extensive,
I'm afraid.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.797
There are hundreds
of companies involved.

11:09.869 --> 11:13.430
Okay, now eliminate the ones
in business over two years.

11:15.775 --> 11:19.541
All right, now scratch out the ones
with a Triple-A Dun and Bradstreet.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.705
Can't touch people
with money like that.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.544
Anything else?
How many left?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.550
81, not counting jobbers.

11:25.618 --> 11:29.315
All right, lose them, too, just give
me the ones in high-risk fashion.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.117
That's sportswear.
Just the hot ones.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.118
We're down to nine.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.491
Okay, key their owners
with the DMV...

11:36.562 --> 11:40.123
and crosscheck job accidents
on the police band.

11:40.199 --> 11:44.727
Then give me the top two. That'll
make our potential victims list.

11:51.944 --> 11:54.242
Which one?
They're both prime.

11:54.580 --> 11:58.038
All right, then I'll pick.
DebJo Fashions?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.276
You got it.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.557
Be good.

12:13.632 --> 12:16.795
Be serious. I'm always good,
Michael. You know that.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.029
I know that.

12:22.274 --> 12:26.040
Move over. No, no, contrast,
darling. I need contrast.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.013
Yes! That's it,
it's perfect, here.

12:29.348 --> 12:33.409
Hop up on the car, and give me a
little profile and a lot of leg.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.516
Good.

12:44.096 --> 12:48.157
It's coughing. It? "He,"
darling. So he has a cold.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.370
Now hold it. Good.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.142
That's not "holding it."

13:07.353 --> 13:09.480
It sneezed.
It?

13:09.588 --> 13:13.115
I told you, he probably has a cold.
Now will you get back up on the hood...

13:13.192 --> 13:15.626
play deaf
and be beautiful for me.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.855
Good.

13:41.854 --> 13:45.585
I'm sorry, we're not open to the public.
That's all right. I'm not the public.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.821
We see salesmen first thing in the
morning and I know you're not a buyer...

13:48.894 --> 13:50.759
My name is Michael Knight.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.697
The only thing I'm here
to sell you is some help.

13:53.933 --> 13:54.957
Oh!

13:55.034 --> 13:58.868
Okay, I've heard that sales pitch
before. How are you going to help me?

13:58.938 --> 14:02.032
I'm going to help you
kick Grebs off your back.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.676
I don't know what you're
talking about. I think you do.

14:06.879 --> 14:08.904
He's pushing you
a little bit too hard.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.886
Who are you? What do you know
about my business with Grebs?

14:14.954 --> 14:16.114
Money.

14:16.355 --> 14:20.883
He's got it and you need it. But once
he gets in, he'll never let you out.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.995
You're wasting my time.

14:25.130 --> 14:29.760
No, I'm not. You see, you need about
$50,000 to get fabrics for your fall line.

14:30.603 --> 14:34.539
You've got hot designs, accounts
receivable, more than enough to cover.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.777
But you got no cash. Grebs has
got that. He's trouble, I'm not.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.175
Debra.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.316
Which one of these wools
falls better over the hips?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.651
Well, that's not
important now.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.589
Joan, I'd like you
to meet Michael Knight.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.524
In shining armor
with a leather jacket...

14:55.594 --> 14:57.027
and a blank check,
or so he says.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.154
Wait a minute...

14:58.230 --> 15:00.960
talking East Coast. Remember,
I'm from the Midwest.

15:01.166 --> 15:05.193
I can't give you a blank check, but
I can give you some straight talk.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.796
You girls have got
a great business going here.

15:07.873 --> 15:11.400
You deal with Grebs long enough and
he'll pick you apart, piece by piece.

15:15.614 --> 15:20.244
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say.
You're not supposed to say anything.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.617
Just think about it, huh?
Don't take too long.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.951
Well, we'll have to talk it over.
Great. That's how to get ahold of me.

15:28.027 --> 15:31.360
Oh, yeah, can you tell me
how to get to O & M Fashions?

15:31.430 --> 15:34.399
O'Malley? Yeah, he's in
the same boat you are.

15:36.568 --> 15:39.059
Maybe, but he's got
a loaded paddle.

15:39.138 --> 15:41.072
You, get out of here.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.805
Go back to Grebs and tell him I can
take care of myself and my business.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.345
And to stay away
from both of them.

15:47.413 --> 15:51.713
Relax, Tom. He's not one of
Grebs' people, I know them all.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.183
Besides, the gun's
not loaded.

15:53.252 --> 15:57.279
Yeah, put that thing away. It's the
unloaded ones that do all the damage.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.753
So he's not from Grebs. So
he ain't Santa Claus either.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.024
Point is,
he ain't one of us.

16:05.030 --> 16:08.659
You, get out of here and take your
conversation back to the gutter.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.726
Why don't you let him
talk first? Not to me.

16:14.206 --> 16:17.642
Bet that guy has got a lot of
friends. Yeah, I'm one of them.

16:18.544 --> 16:23.038
He's a good man. Forgets that he's not a
kid anymore, but we all like to do that.

16:23.115 --> 16:27.313
You got a place here, too? They're
all mine, one time or another.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.753
When cash gets tough, I front them
money on their accounts receivable.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.850
A factor. Well, then you're
in competition with Grebs, huh?

16:35.527 --> 16:36.858
Could be a little dangerous.

16:37.963 --> 16:41.592
If I can keep people in business, I
can deal with them again and again.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.635
I'm a legitimate part
of this industry.

16:44.803 --> 16:45.895
I believe you.

16:45.971 --> 16:50.374
Then also believe you should wait a
few days before you talk to Tom again.

17:04.490 --> 17:08.290
I'm glad we're leaving.
We'll be back.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.852
Two down, seven to go.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.796
Michael, I'd prefer you
park me in a lot next time.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.699
The people one comes
in contact with here...

19:20.058 --> 19:23.585
You'll love our next stop,
Michael. Muriel's Menswear.

19:23.662 --> 19:27.223
Can't be worse than the first
two. I'm talking dead ends.

19:27.299 --> 19:31.235
You think they were tough? Muriel's
been 52 years in the garment business.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.431
Born in Brooklyn in
ought-nine. Ought-nine?

19:35.140 --> 19:37.836
Wonder if she ever saw
the Brooklyn Dodgers play.

19:37.910 --> 19:41.744
Michael, one of our keyed license
plates just flashed on police band.

19:41.813 --> 19:45.374
An automobile-train collision
three miles north of here.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.987
I'm afraid it's Tom O'Malley.

19:55.727 --> 19:58.787
A witness placed a second car
leaving the scene westbound.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.059
A red and white custom sedan.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.064
Speak of the devil.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.535
Let's get him before he causes
any more accidents.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.901
He'll be hard
to catch, Michael.

20:06.972 --> 20:09.532
We'll have to plot a course
doubling back against traffic.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.371
Don't say it, do it.

20:20.018 --> 20:23.545
Did you get a make on him? I'm
afraid not. Contact was too brief.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.504
There he is, Michael.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.235
All right, we nail him.

21:22.714 --> 21:26.275
You in a rush? Not anymore.
I'll take this through myself.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.216
That's against the rules.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.684
Be my guest.
Use all the soap you want.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.776
How could we lose him?

21:55.847 --> 21:58.042
My calculations placed
our contact point...

21:58.116 --> 21:59.344
right at this corner.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.007
What'd he do, go airborne?

22:29.448 --> 22:31.848
No, Michael, but somehow
he just seemed to vanish.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.385
There isn't a car like it
within four blocks.

22:53.472 --> 22:56.464
I told you, I'm not the type.
I'm not buying it, Lewis.

22:56.641 --> 23:00.099
O'Malley was your friend.
Hell of a pinochle player.

23:00.379 --> 23:04.213
Every day over lunch, for years,
we played. The man is dead.

23:04.616 --> 23:07.676
The man is dead. Help
me do something about it.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.618
You don't know much about
this business, do you?

23:09.688 --> 23:12.657
Innocent people are dropping like
flies. How much do I need to know?

23:14.459 --> 23:18.293
Back on the Lower East Side of New
York, this used to happen a lot.

23:18.363 --> 23:19.853
I buried
some good friends.

23:19.931 --> 23:23.059
Great, so you want to watch it
happen all over again?

23:23.135 --> 23:26.571
Grebs decides to make the trade his
own backyard and everybody rolls over.

23:26.638 --> 23:28.401
What can I do alone, huh?

23:28.874 --> 23:31.775
You get a crowd together,
I might get brave.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.501
You know, I'm not that young
and I'm not a hero. You are.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.207
You are not alone. Crowds
start with one or two people.

23:37.282 --> 23:38.840
Believe me,
I get this thing rolling...

23:38.917 --> 23:40.544
we'll attract
plenty of attention.

23:40.619 --> 23:42.450
Help me, please.

23:45.223 --> 23:48.624
I'm listening. I'm crazy,
but I'm listening.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.755
That's none of your business!

23:50.829 --> 23:53.798
Come on, you're not shy.
How much do you owe Grebs?

23:54.933 --> 23:56.423
Why do you want to know?

23:56.501 --> 23:59.937
Because Mr. Lewis here wants
to take over your factor.

24:00.238 --> 24:02.399
He wants to buy out
Grebs' debt.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.165
Obviously,
you don't know Grebs.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.005
That's not very
smart business.

24:06.144 --> 24:09.204
For us, maybe not.
For you, it's brilliant.

24:09.648 --> 24:12.549
What's his rate?
20 points, 25?

24:13.218 --> 24:16.278
I'll take over your whole figure
for one point over prime rate.

24:16.354 --> 24:17.412
What?

24:17.489 --> 24:21.186
Why are you doing this? I can't
even get a car loan that cheap.

24:21.259 --> 24:25.127
I got my reasons. Grebs killed
Tom O'Malley this morning.

24:26.331 --> 24:28.322
I heard that was
an accident.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.335
Yeah, right, just like
Sam Dennis was an accident.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.404
Here's the draft.

24:34.239 --> 24:37.003
Fill in the amount. Add a
little cushion if you like.

24:38.643 --> 24:43.342
The money is fine. What keeps us
from being Grebs' next accident?

24:44.049 --> 24:46.040
I will. I now own...

24:48.453 --> 24:51.786
one share of common stock
in DebJo Fashions.

24:52.824 --> 24:56.055
We don't have any stock.
This is a partnership.

24:56.461 --> 24:58.952
Well, when you do, consider me
in on the ground floor.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.397
Right now, you've hired
a brand new head of security.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.330
Partners?

25:07.506 --> 25:08.803
Partners.

25:12.577 --> 25:14.010
Michael, I sent you out...

25:14.079 --> 25:16.479
to stop the deaths,
not cause more.

25:16.548 --> 25:18.277
Jeopardizing your own life
is one thing...

25:18.350 --> 25:20.614
but drawing three innocent
people in is quite another.

25:20.685 --> 25:24.121
Don't worry, I'll protect
them. As you protected O'Malley?

25:25.824 --> 25:28.258
Oh, sorry, Michael. Sorry.
That's all right.

25:28.393 --> 25:29.951
You're right, Devon.

25:30.028 --> 25:33.293
I'm telling you, these garment
people are a close, tight-knit group.

25:33.398 --> 25:36.060
I wasn't getting anywhere
ringing doorbells.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.670
So you decided
to go to the opposite extreme.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.706
Michael, I wish you had
checked with me first.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.435
Right, and by the time we get
through discussing procedure here...

25:44.509 --> 25:46.568
another one bites the dust.

25:47.946 --> 25:49.470
Devon, look...

25:49.548 --> 25:52.415
I'm sorry. I respect
what you do. I really do.

25:52.484 --> 25:55.885
While I was out there spinning
my wheels, I saw another man die.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.319
I had to do something.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.955
I assume you have
some plan in mind?

26:01.026 --> 26:03.688
I'll let Grebs know there's
another competitor on the block.

26:03.762 --> 26:05.855
One that won't go belly up
when he snaps his fingers.

26:05.931 --> 26:06.955
And then?

26:07.032 --> 26:08.192
If I shake him hard enough...

26:08.266 --> 26:10.757
I'm convinced I'll be the next
target for his mobile assassin.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.769
Only I've got an ace in the hole. KITT?

26:12.871 --> 26:14.031
Exactly.

26:14.105 --> 26:17.632
Now once I get his driver nailed and
he faces murder charges all alone...

26:17.809 --> 26:21.643
ten to one he turns on Grebs and supplies
us with all the ammunition we need.

26:21.713 --> 26:25.012
Right. Michael,
good luck, old boy.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.712
$20,000 cash.

26:31.122 --> 26:34.091
I just paid off the debt
from DebJo Fashions.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.020
I'd like the note.

26:36.328 --> 26:39.559
Who are you, their guardian angel?
It's a very good way of putting it.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.260
The note?

26:43.301 --> 26:46.099
Those girls must be doing
better than I thought.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.765
I'll have to look into it.

26:49.841 --> 26:52.969
The girls are doing fine. They just
found a better way to deal than you.

26:53.044 --> 26:54.568
Is that so?
Yeah, that is so.

26:54.646 --> 26:57.740
You see, I'm a new partner
in DebJo Fashions.

26:57.816 --> 27:01.445
Oh, don't tell me, let me
guess. You're into dresses.

27:01.586 --> 27:04.885
No, I'm into money,
and muscle where it's needed.

27:05.724 --> 27:06.884
The note please.

27:06.958 --> 27:11.122
You know something? I've seen boys
like you come and go around here.

27:12.130 --> 27:16.396
The sportswear business is a rough
trade. The girls will be back to me.

27:16.768 --> 27:18.258
I don't think so.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.566
And if I were you,
I'd plan to lose some more.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.972
You see, I'm going to move in
on every one of your accounts.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.977
Get out of here before I
move you out the window.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.742
Pleasure doing business
with you.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.090
KITT, monitor Grebs' phones.
I want to see who he calls.

27:40.358 --> 27:41.950
Very well, but, Michael...

27:42.027 --> 27:43.995
you have an emergency call
from Joan.

27:44.062 --> 27:45.359
She has to see you.
At DebJo?

27:45.430 --> 27:46.727
No, she was afraid
to go there.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.629
She's waiting for you
on top of the building.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.759
The elevator's on your right.
I'm on my way.

28:22.233 --> 28:24.064
KITT, I need you up here
right away.

29:30.068 --> 29:32.127
Michael, Michael,
can you hear me?

29:34.339 --> 29:35.670
Yeah, KITT.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.777
My preliminary med-scan doesn't
indicate any serious injury.

29:39.844 --> 29:41.141
That's easy for you to say.

29:42.647 --> 29:44.376
I can call a paramedic unit.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.542
No, I'll take a rain check.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.115
Where's that killer car?
Long gone, I'm afraid.

29:52.257 --> 29:55.920
Gone, but not forgotten.
Not by a long shot.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.791
Come on, we got work to do.

30:14.412 --> 30:15.504
Michael...

30:15.580 --> 30:17.844
how could you put yourself
in a spot like this?

30:17.916 --> 30:20.009
It wasn't easy,
believe me.

30:20.084 --> 30:22.416
If it weren't for KITT,
I wouldn't be here now.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.614
Well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

30:24.689 --> 30:26.589
I didn't like this plan
from the very beginning.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.717
Don't rub it in.
He's rubbing it in.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.693
It's his way of
showing you he cares.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.731
I intensely dislike being
talked about in the third person.

30:33.798 --> 30:37.757
And I don't need anyone to interpret
my statements, thank you very much.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.272
What happened? I went to
meet Joan. She wasn't there.

30:41.739 --> 30:43.798
Instead, I found
the killer car.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.809
I assume there's
a reasonable explanation...

30:45.877 --> 30:47.208
as to why she wasn't there.

30:47.278 --> 30:50.577
Well, she said she saw me leaving
the parking structure and...

30:50.648 --> 30:52.878
There, there, you see now?

30:53.718 --> 30:57.779
By forcing Grebs' hand, we have
placed ourselves in a state of war.

30:58.122 --> 31:01.455
Now your friends are vulnerable,
and we're obliged to protect them.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.185
I guess you feel
pretty strongly about that.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.664
I have never felt so strongly
about anything.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.498
And no sacrifice
would be too great.

31:11.836 --> 31:14.396
That's right, none, none.
None whatsoever. Good.

31:14.472 --> 31:15.564
Bonnie.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.675
Okay, gang.

31:19.911 --> 31:23.108
Introducing the temporary home
of DebJo Fashions.

31:26.484 --> 31:27.974
What is this?

31:32.357 --> 31:35.019
You mind if I use the
phone, Michael? Go ahead.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.757
It's not bad
for off the rack.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.896
I run a tight operation.

31:49.274 --> 31:51.799
Not like some of these guys
who move to Miami...

31:51.876 --> 31:55.141
and do their business
on a phone under a palm tree.

31:55.847 --> 31:59.044
Now, all of a sudden,
I'm not in control any more.

31:59.284 --> 32:01.184
People are defying me.

32:01.452 --> 32:03.386
And you, the guy
who never misses...

32:03.454 --> 32:05.649
suddenly, out of the blue,
you miss.

32:05.723 --> 32:08.157
I hit him, he's hurt.
Not enough.

32:08.459 --> 32:10.689
You know what your trouble is?
You're too perfect.

32:11.729 --> 32:14.459
Maybe if you took a drink out of
a dirty glass once in a while...

32:14.532 --> 32:15.556
you wouldn't blow
the big ones.

32:15.633 --> 32:18.101
You've said enough, Grebs.
Now don't push it.

32:18.303 --> 32:20.237
You're not behind
the wheel of a car now.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.440
Like I said...

32:24.042 --> 32:26.670
we get a couple of people
who refuse to go along...

32:26.744 --> 32:28.541
and if we let them
keep breathing...

32:28.613 --> 32:31.844
before you know it, there's four
or five of them, or maybe a dozen...

32:31.916 --> 32:33.281
and so on, and so on.

32:35.520 --> 32:39.684
None of this would be happening if
it wasn't for that Knight character.

32:42.126 --> 32:45.095
I want him gone, Flood.
I want him gone.

32:46.497 --> 32:48.158
I double your fee.

32:52.870 --> 32:56.499
Keep your bonus money.
This isn't business anymore.

32:57.175 --> 33:00.508
This is personal.
This one is on me.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.945
Feeling any better?
Oh, I don't know, I guess so.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.383
Listen, you really
didn't have to drive me back.

33:11.456 --> 33:15.984
Call me a little bit paranoid. I don't
want to take any chances right now.

33:17.862 --> 33:19.295
Any regrets?

33:20.031 --> 33:22.329
You mean about
standing up to Grebs?

33:23.768 --> 33:25.827
As a matter of fact, yeah.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.401
I'm scared and I don't like
being scared.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.202
You kidding? Nobody does.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.868
Some people handle it better
than others. You, for instance.

33:37.281 --> 33:39.044
Occupational hazard.

33:41.552 --> 33:45.989
He's going to win, isn't he?
Grebs. In the end, he'll win.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.419
Not if I can help it.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.189
Michael, what are we gonna do? We're
trapped. He can just wait us out.

33:52.263 --> 33:56.256
Unless I miss my guess, I don't think
waiting is one of Grebs' strengths.

33:56.334 --> 34:00.828
Besides, I've got something in mind that
I think is really going to stir up the pot.

34:08.913 --> 34:11.438
Michael, please don't leave me
on this dreadful street.

34:11.516 --> 34:12.676
Relax, buddy.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.184
I don't like people
sitting on me.

34:23.995 --> 34:28.694
Oh, it's back, perfect. Black on
black, a single strand of pearls!

34:33.004 --> 34:34.494
Not you again.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.166
It talks!
Who cares, most drivers do.

34:37.375 --> 34:40.036
Listen, I'm doing print here.
I don't pay S.A.G.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.773
So just kind of drape yourself
over the fender.

34:42.847 --> 34:45.371
Good. Perfect.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.275
It's none of my business, but
your F-stop should be opened...

34:49.353 --> 34:50.945
and your
shutter speed reduced.

34:51.022 --> 34:54.014
This is ridiculous!
No, he may have a point there.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.356
Would you say F-8 or 11?

34:57.995 --> 35:00.293
You're talking
to an empty car!

35:00.364 --> 35:03.765
Given present light
conditions, eight. Got you.

35:08.906 --> 35:12.171
Hey, is this a "take" or
a "leave"? It's a "take."

35:15.680 --> 35:17.978
You okay?
Sure.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.547
No, you're not.
What's wrong?

35:25.056 --> 35:29.686
I was just remembering what it was like
when Joan and I first moved in here.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.861
We had such high hopes.

35:32.330 --> 35:35.891
We worked nights, weekends.
Nothing was going to stop us.

35:36.667 --> 35:40.125
Now I just have this awful feeling that
I'm never going to see this place again.

35:40.204 --> 35:42.695
I got a great feeling
that you are.

35:43.107 --> 35:45.905
You don't know Grebs.
You don't know me.

35:50.114 --> 35:52.344
I got some good news for you.

35:52.416 --> 35:53.849
I'm listening.

35:53.918 --> 35:57.217
I called in an old marker
from an old friend.

35:58.189 --> 36:00.521
So I got
inside information now.

36:02.793 --> 36:06.729
From now on, we'll know everything
we need to know about Michael Knight.

36:06.864 --> 36:11.665
What he's planning,
where he is, where he'll be.

36:46.704 --> 36:50.140
Just cleaning up some of
the mess here for Tom's wife.

36:50.608 --> 36:53.042
His kids are all grown.
They have a life.

36:53.277 --> 36:54.869
But Annie is all alone.

36:56.314 --> 36:59.511
Don't you think we owe her
a little something more?

36:59.984 --> 37:02.782
Like what? She's got
enough money from insurance.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.354
Like Grebs' scalp.

37:05.590 --> 37:08.320
I know this is the West, but
there's no more cowboys and Indians.

37:08.392 --> 37:09.791
It's the same difference,
you know.

37:09.860 --> 37:12.055
We're just a bunch of
small-time operators here...

37:12.129 --> 37:14.927
fighting the big, bad wolf,
you know? The cattle baron.

37:15.132 --> 37:17.259
And none of us can fight
this guy alone.

37:17.335 --> 37:21.738
We need to get a group of our
own people together, a posse.

37:21.806 --> 37:24.570
That car must have hit you
too hard. How's your head?

37:24.642 --> 37:27.076
Lewis, I'm serious.

37:27.678 --> 37:30.010
Now how many of the owners
can you really trust?

37:31.349 --> 37:32.475
Tom's gone.

37:34.318 --> 37:37.719
I don't know. Maybe six or seven
more. You do business with all of them?

37:38.322 --> 37:40.756
Used to.
Grebs has them now.

37:40.825 --> 37:44.022
Those are exactly the ones I
want. Now, can you round them up?

37:44.095 --> 37:45.824
You try and put together
a meeting like that...

37:45.896 --> 37:48.865
and Grebs will know about it
before anybody even sits down.

37:49.667 --> 37:51.692
I made my move. I put my money
where my mouth is.

37:51.769 --> 37:54.966
Maybe it's time for me to shut up.
Maybe it's time you visit Tom's grave...

37:55.039 --> 37:57.371
and put some nice flowers
out there. Oh, I got it:

37:57.441 --> 37:59.238
Teach his wife
how to play pinochle.

37:59.310 --> 38:01.710
Sit around and tell a few
stories about good old Tom.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.714
Maybe you're not too big to be
sitting on the floor, looking up at me.

38:04.782 --> 38:08.013
Now, it's about time you got mad. So
get mad at the right guy, will you?

38:08.085 --> 38:09.484
Get mad at Grebs.

38:15.993 --> 38:17.585
The word is "enough."

38:19.230 --> 38:20.720
You've given enough.

38:21.532 --> 38:23.659
You've taken enough,
enough of fear.

38:23.734 --> 38:25.998
Come on, you people have
worked too hard all your life...

38:26.070 --> 38:28.231
to give away everything
you've attained.

38:28.439 --> 38:30.566
Lewis, what is it
with this guy?

38:30.741 --> 38:33.301
He's selling T-shirts
with targets on the back.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.775
Maybe you ought to
listen to him. I did.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.775
You guys know I'm not the easiest
person in the world to con.

38:38.916 --> 38:42.215
So what do we do, buy guns,
circle the wagons?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.983
No, you cut off Grebs supply of
money. You kill his cash flow.

38:47.558 --> 38:49.890
I've been poor before
and I know what broke is.

38:50.628 --> 38:55.327
Forget all the poetry written about it.
It's not fun. I don't want to do it again.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.831
I can't do it again.
Why not?

39:00.037 --> 39:02.972
Why not? When I first met you, you
were a cutter on the third floor.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.942
I backed you the first two years.
You were a good man and a hard worker.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.502
You pay Grebs off
and I'll back you again.

39:10.348 --> 39:15.081
You, Joe, you were doing cuffs
in a denim factory 12 years ago.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.882
You had guts and a talent
and I bet on it.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.681
I'll bet on it again.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.725
You have any idea
how much we owe Grebs?

39:28.799 --> 39:32.735
To the penny. I've been around
too long not to know.

39:33.738 --> 39:36.366
I'm willing to back
every person in this room.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.008
Then we really got nothing
to lose.

39:39.076 --> 39:41.340
You're the only one
who can take a bath.

39:41.912 --> 39:43.743
I've been broke before,
you know.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.743
Wasn't so bad.

39:49.820 --> 39:53.779
Whether you like it
or not, you're a hero.

39:54.525 --> 39:55.514
Yeah, yeah.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.754
They're down there
at a meeting right now.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.991
Michael Knight is trying to get
the whole group of them together.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.434
And I can give you
every name.

40:06.604 --> 40:09.129
So do it.
I will, but...

40:10.408 --> 40:12.842
I have to know what's going
to happen on my end of it.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.538
I set you up with that
Debra Sands, didn't I?

40:16.247 --> 40:18.807
I helped make your line
the hottest in town.

40:19.350 --> 40:23.286
What else do you want?
I want to run O & M Fashions.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.419
I've struggled for 10 years.

40:26.490 --> 40:29.288
I've even put up with Debra
playing showroom chic...

40:29.360 --> 40:31.624
while I sweated it out
in the back rooms.

40:32.997 --> 40:36.398
I want O & M for me!
It's mine.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.330
That's why I pushed on it.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.796
That's why O'Malley
and the others are dead.

40:43.474 --> 40:45.499
You're a piece
of equipment...

40:45.576 --> 40:47.976
a piece of rented equipment.
You understand that?

40:48.045 --> 40:51.913
I push the buttons. I turn
you on and I turn you off.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.844
You got that?

40:54.819 --> 40:56.684
It's not just for me.

40:57.154 --> 41:00.590
I can run that operation
successfully. You know I can.

41:00.691 --> 41:04.718
The names, the names. There's
Lewis, the factor, and there's...

41:04.795 --> 41:07.889
The meeting could go on for hours.
You want Michael Knight or not?

41:08.065 --> 41:10.795
You know I do, unless he's
too tough for you.

41:11.268 --> 41:15.398
Don't push your luck, Grebs.
Accidents can happen to anyone.

41:32.256 --> 41:34.121
Well, Michael, you've done it.

41:34.391 --> 41:37.224
Yeah, maybe not by the book,
but I think it will work.

41:37.294 --> 41:38.955
I certainly hope so. If not...

41:39.029 --> 41:42.795
perhaps we both should get one of
those T-shirts with bull's-eyes on them.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.199
What is this? You were
listening in, huh?

41:45.302 --> 41:47.964
If I'm going to be a target,
I'd like to know about it.

41:48.038 --> 41:50.199
At least you'll be
a moving target.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.265
Anything yet?

42:24.174 --> 42:26.005
Nothing out of the ordinary.

42:48.365 --> 42:51.926
I think we've got company.
Affirmative, Michael.

43:16.126 --> 43:18.617
We've got a sharp curve
1000 meters ahead.

43:20.364 --> 43:23.697
Okay, pal, it's time to give
him a taste of his own medicine.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.897
All right, I need everything
you can give me.

43:54.999 --> 43:57.490
All right, KITT,
let's give him a push.

44:01.171 --> 44:03.071
Three hundred meters
to the curve.

44:13.484 --> 44:16.351
He'll never make it past the
curve. You have to slow down.

44:28.565 --> 44:30.430
All right. You and I are
going to talk...

44:30.501 --> 44:32.935
about a couple of murders
and a man named Grebs.

44:36.073 --> 44:39.042
Wise guy, huh? KITT, you
want to do the honors?

44:47.851 --> 44:50.581
Okay, okay!
Thank you, KITT.

44:51.121 --> 44:54.488
Okay, what do you want to
know? Pop in the cassette, KITT.

44:59.663 --> 45:00.789
Michael...

45:04.034 --> 45:07.629
Oh, thank God you got here.
He wouldn't let me go.

45:08.338 --> 45:11.535
Really? That's not
what Mr. Flood said.

45:12.109 --> 45:15.340
You know, once this guy started
talking, he had an awful lot to say.

45:17.948 --> 45:20.314
Cuff them, both of them.

45:21.218 --> 45:24.210
What are you doing?
Why don't you shut your mouth?

46:00.991 --> 46:04.119
Fits like a glove. It's
supposed to fit like a jacket.

46:04.895 --> 46:07.090
I haven't heard that line
since I left New York.

46:07.164 --> 46:09.394
Well, it was time.
Thank you.

46:10.234 --> 46:12.498
Thank me?
Michael, you're crazy.

46:12.703 --> 46:16.139
If it weren't for you, I'd be back
modeling rags on Eighth Avenue.

46:16.206 --> 46:19.073
You probably would
look terrific doing it, too.

46:19.143 --> 46:22.203
I'll see you in the
magazines. Not so fast.

46:28.152 --> 46:30.245
Now you can go.
Bye.

46:34.591 --> 46:35.683
He'll be back.

46:59.149 --> 47:02.744
Is this your car?
The last time I looked. Why?

47:03.120 --> 47:05.384
You ought to teach it
better manners.

47:07.491 --> 47:11.587
Darling, this could be your best layout.
This one could make you. Come back.

47:11.695 --> 47:12.719
KITT...

47:13.297 --> 47:14.457
what did you say to her?

47:14.531 --> 47:16.260
Nothing of
consequence, Michael.

47:16.333 --> 47:17.322
Yeah, right.

47:17.401 --> 47:21.531
I merely computed her exact
weight and advised her of it.

47:21.605 --> 47:24.699
Did I commit a faux pas,
as the French would say?

47:24.775 --> 47:27.608
Yeah, as the French would say,
but as we say...

47:27.678 --> 47:30.909
you made a big mistake.
Oh.
