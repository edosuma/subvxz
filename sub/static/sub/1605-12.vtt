02:00.094 --> 02:01.220
Did you get in trouble, too?

02:02.847 --> 02:03.931
(SCOFFS)

02:04.516 --> 02:08.561
Sometimes the feelings inside
me get messy like dirt.

02:08.812 --> 02:10.312
And I like to clean things.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.607
Pretend the dirt
is the feelings.

02:13.566 --> 02:15.485
This floor is my mind.

02:16.110 --> 02:19.155
That is called coping.

02:20.906 --> 02:22.200
And the COs don't care

02:22.283 --> 02:23.993
'cause they like things clean.

02:24.076 --> 02:25.077
(SCOFFS)

02:25.203 --> 02:28.414
And that is called symbiosis.

02:29.624 --> 02:31.376
Suzanne, listen.

02:33.586 --> 02:37.048
Those things that
Larry said on the radio?

02:37.882 --> 02:40.259
They sounded a lot worse
than they really were.

02:40.385 --> 02:43.805
And when I said those things to
him, it was before I knew you.

02:44.972 --> 02:47.392
Before I knew what
a nice person you are.

02:50.019 --> 02:52.139
And you have to admit that
you come on a little strong.

02:52.397 --> 02:55.899
It's okay, dandelion.
You know why?

02:56.401 --> 02:58.403
I used to spend
a lot of time thinking

02:58.528 --> 03:00.071
how I could make you love me.

03:00.196 --> 03:02.782
Like, if I had
long pretty hair,

03:02.906 --> 03:05.410
or if I made a chocolate
cake with frosting,

03:05.535 --> 03:07.662
or if I had a green bicycle.

03:07.746 --> 03:11.708
No! You are great
the way that you are.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.376
I know.

03:13.459 --> 03:17.088
Because the answer is,
you're not a nice person.

03:20.675 --> 03:22.468
You're a mean person.

03:22.844 --> 03:26.890
And I used to think you
was a yellow dandelion

03:28.182 --> 03:31.060
but you're all dried up
with the puff blown off.

03:31.143 --> 03:32.937
And it's not your fault.

03:33.062 --> 03:37.066
You are who you are,
like, I am who I am.

03:38.443 --> 03:39.444
I'm not mean.

03:42.363 --> 03:44.741
I didn't mean
to be mean to you.

03:46.576 --> 03:48.870
You gotta start
from the inside out

03:48.953 --> 03:50.955
or else you'll
step on the clean.

04:08.306 --> 04:09.432
Hey.

04:10.099 --> 04:11.976
Look at you,

04:12.059 --> 04:14.604
waking up for crack
of dawn I-told-you-so.

04:14.687 --> 04:15.980
That's dedication.

04:16.648 --> 04:18.149
I have to pee.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.858
But as long as I'm here,

04:19.983 --> 04:22.987
how's that, uh, spontaneous
confession treating you? (CHUCKLES)

04:23.154 --> 04:25.657
Shittier than I thought,
which is impressive,

04:25.740 --> 04:28.159
considering I'm literally
scrubbing toilets.

04:28.367 --> 04:31.078
You're sucking all of the
joy out of my gloat.

04:32.622 --> 04:34.332
You gonna tell me what
happened with the fiance?

04:34.415 --> 04:35.917
Oh, you know,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.545
I accused him of feeding
on my misfortune

04:39.671 --> 04:41.297
with the sensitivity
of a vampire squid,

04:41.422 --> 04:44.509
and then he accused
me of betraying him

04:44.592 --> 04:46.928
in a disgusting, yet totally
predictable manner.

04:47.011 --> 04:48.888
So, we're in a good place.
(SIGHS)

04:49.889 --> 04:51.182
I'm sorry, Pipes.

04:51.599 --> 04:56.521
And that was before
he told me that his father,

04:56.813 --> 05:00.024
AKA my lawyer,
looked at the records

05:00.441 --> 05:06.739
and found out that it was you
who ratted me out to the Feds.

05:11.953 --> 05:13.162
(GATE BUZZES)

05:14.288 --> 05:15.289
Fuck.

05:15.414 --> 05:18.042
Don't worry about it. I
mean, fool me once, right?

05:19.126 --> 05:21.045
Okay, listen...
Alex.

05:22.254 --> 05:24.716
I'm over it. Really.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.928
It's fine.

05:35.393 --> 05:36.686
(INMATES CHATTING)

05:37.186 --> 05:38.187
You got mine?

05:38.646 --> 05:39.939
Caputo's special!

05:52.368 --> 05:54.808
You know, you're not supposed to
take food out of here, Sister.

05:54.871 --> 05:56.915
SISTER INGALLS: Maybe we
can bend that rule a bit.

05:56.998 --> 05:59.625
At my age you, you've got to
keep your blood sugar steady.

05:59.751 --> 06:01.126
I dip at around 10:00.

06:02.587 --> 06:03.922
Don't worry about it.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.345
Oatmeal and cheese
sandwich, no crusts.

06:13.681 --> 06:15.307
You should eat something.

06:17.142 --> 06:18.394
He's coming.

06:23.232 --> 06:26.485
(STUTTERS) I like the
shape of your ears.

06:29.864 --> 06:31.490
What else do you
like the shape of?

06:33.284 --> 06:34.410
(SHUSHES)

06:37.830 --> 06:39.331
You know what I miss?

06:39.457 --> 06:40.792
Mimosas.

06:42.376 --> 06:45.128
I'm gonna need your help
with something.

06:47.090 --> 06:49.508
(MAN SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY OVER PA)

06:50.133 --> 06:51.970
You missed breakfast.

06:52.135 --> 06:54.305
I needed to sleep
more than I needed eggs.

06:56.641 --> 06:58.643
Miss Claudette,

06:58.768 --> 07:01.144
I want to apologize to you for
everything that Larry said.

07:01.270 --> 07:02.480
I had no idea it was gonna...

07:02.605 --> 07:05.149
I know the stories they
say about me, Chapman.

07:05.232 --> 07:07.352
I wish you'd thought enough
of me to ask for the truth.

07:08.820 --> 07:09.988
(SNIFFLES)

07:11.948 --> 07:14.158
If you're getting sick,

07:14.241 --> 07:15.326
please keep your hands clean

07:15.451 --> 07:17.202
and stay on your side
of the room.

07:17.954 --> 07:20.999
Tomorrow is a big day for me
and I won't have you ruin it.

07:21.124 --> 07:22.667
That seems to be
a talent of yours.

07:26.963 --> 07:28.324
You ain't said
nothin' all morning.

07:29.548 --> 07:31.592
There ain't nothing
worth saying.

07:32.217 --> 07:34.018
And they say there's no
such thing as miracles.

07:36.014 --> 07:38.182
Yikes.
No scrappy rejoinder?

07:39.308 --> 07:40.909
They must have put
you on the scary meds.

07:41.519 --> 07:42.880
Why ain't you
throwing back at her?

07:43.021 --> 07:44.563
'Cause there ain't no
point, Leanne, all right?

07:44.689 --> 07:46.231
I got beat.

07:46.357 --> 07:48.651
Ain't nobody up there
looking out for me no more.

07:49.234 --> 07:50.528
I'm looking out for you.

07:50.945 --> 07:52.279
You know,
he finally come to me,

07:52.363 --> 07:54.283
after all this time that
I've been following him.

07:54.323 --> 07:56.450
I finally heard him talk to me,

07:56.534 --> 07:59.537
him saying how I was
his girl, I was.

08:00.788 --> 08:01.956
Turns out it weren't him.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.541
No, it was Chapman,

08:04.042 --> 08:05.751
the bitch devil of Litchfield.

08:06.418 --> 08:08.838
Well, you missed her
boyfriend's crazy radio show.

08:09.005 --> 08:11.132
Hey. Chapman put
her ass on the line

08:11.215 --> 08:13.342
to get you out
of Psych, you know?

08:13.509 --> 08:14.909
She's cleaning toilets
every morning

08:14.927 --> 08:16.261
like Private
"fucking" Benjamin.

08:17.471 --> 08:20.558
Look, I ain't looking
for revenge, okay?

08:22.309 --> 08:24.395
She'd probably
kick my ass anyway.

08:24.562 --> 08:28.273
No way, Tucky. You're
small but you got spit.

08:28.399 --> 08:29.692
Man, do you know what it means,

08:29.775 --> 08:32.528
when there ain't nobody up
there punishing the evildoers?

08:32.904 --> 08:36.032
It means there ain't nobody giving out
prizes for the good ones, neither.

08:36.741 --> 08:39.952
'Cause there ain't no judge,
there ain't no justice.

08:40.078 --> 08:44.749
We just crawl around this Earth
like ants and then we die.

You don't gotta kill it.

I'm just thinking
about you, is all.

08:57.428 --> 08:58.637
(SCOFFS) I mean, you
show 'em a baby,

08:58.763 --> 09:00.283
you get good money
from the government.

09:00.389 --> 09:01.557
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:04.309 --> 09:06.854
All kinds of things
in them packages you get.

09:06.938 --> 09:09.690
Cheese, peanut butter.

09:11.109 --> 09:12.276
Baby food.

09:13.527 --> 09:16.072
Hell, you can make a good
casserole out of baby food.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.783
Sprinkle some Fritos
on top, tuna.

09:19.575 --> 09:23.996
Tasty as hell, and baby
food is vegetables.

09:24.205 --> 09:25.806
Well, if you're eating
all the baby food,

09:25.915 --> 09:27.708
what's the baby supposed to eat?
(CHUCKLES)

09:30.128 --> 09:31.629
Suit yourself.

09:31.921 --> 09:33.131
I'm not keeping it, Arlen.

09:35.591 --> 09:37.301
You never keep it.

09:37.927 --> 09:39.011
(SIGHS)

09:39.511 --> 09:43.682
Look, my cousin, Sierra, she had a
baby down at County last summer,

09:43.933 --> 09:45.226
and after they drug tested her,

09:45.309 --> 09:46.811
they took the baby boy away

09:46.894 --> 09:50.689
and they arrested her for
endangering a minor, okay?

09:51.523 --> 09:53.818
So, I think babies
are cute and all

09:53.901 --> 09:56.612
but I ain't going
to jail for this fucker.

09:58.156 --> 09:59.991
Well, another idea is,

10:03.077 --> 10:04.495
you could stop doing drugs.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.417
(BOTH SNIGGERING)

(COUGHING)

10:20.970 --> 10:24.056
For real, though, I need a
ride tomorrow to the clinic.

10:26.058 --> 10:29.937
Hell, tomorrow I gotta do
the thing with the hammers.

10:34.150 --> 10:35.526
(URINATING)

10:41.991 --> 10:43.117
Jesus!

10:43.201 --> 10:44.285
Hey.

You know what's overrated?

Toast.

10:55.671 --> 10:56.839
Wanna fuck in the pantry?

10:56.964 --> 10:58.883
Hey!
Get out of here.

10:59.008 --> 11:00.218
You're gonna get us shot.

11:00.592 --> 11:02.011
I'm serious.

11:03.679 --> 11:05.520
I was so afraid about you
finding out the truth,

11:05.597 --> 11:07.225
but now it's out,
and it's okay.

11:07.683 --> 11:09.268
It's kind of a rush.

11:10.228 --> 11:12.104
Cool thing about sex
in an industrial kitchen

11:12.230 --> 11:13.438
is there's a ton
of margarine in here.

11:13.689 --> 11:14.690
Stop it, Alex.

11:14.773 --> 11:15.774
Come on, babe.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.651
Let's celebrate how totally
fine you are with everything.

11:17.776 --> 11:18.861
You're freaking me out.

11:18.944 --> 11:19.987
You ain't seen nothing yet.

11:20.154 --> 11:21.488
I said stop it.
What?

11:21.572 --> 11:23.866
Can't a girl be totally overcome
with desire for someone

11:23.949 --> 11:25.034
who's being so cool,

11:25.117 --> 11:26.160
and so forgiving?

11:26.244 --> 11:27.828
We're not okay!

11:30.413 --> 11:31.665
This is not fine!

11:31.749 --> 11:34.252
Good. Now we could
talk about it.

11:34.417 --> 11:35.457
It that what this is about?

11:35.586 --> 11:37.420
Yeah. That's what this is about.

11:38.089 --> 11:41.259
You find out that I personally
got you thrown in here

11:41.384 --> 11:44.136
at the exact moment your manicured
fingers were like closing

11:44.262 --> 11:45.346
on the yuppie brass ring,

11:45.428 --> 11:47.639
and somehow you don't
have a problem with it?

11:47.765 --> 11:48.933
You are so full of shit.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.393
Fuck you.

11:51.434 --> 11:52.937
Fuck you, Alex.

11:53.562 --> 11:54.855
You want me to be angry?

11:54.939 --> 11:58.109
Well, guess what, I'm really fucking
angry, because I love you, Alex.

11:59.777 --> 12:02.863
I love you
and I fucking hate you.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.284
I have really been trying
to keep my shit together,

12:06.409 --> 12:09.828
but if you really need to see
me Hulk out over this...

12:12.706 --> 12:14.250
Larry left you, didn't he?

12:17.795 --> 12:21.299
And that's why you're
fake-fine with me.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.302
Right now you're willing to
overlook pretty much anything

12:24.427 --> 12:28.055
because ultimately you are
just terrified of being alone.

12:30.849 --> 12:32.851
Is that what I am to you?

12:33.185 --> 12:38.149
A fucking binky for you to
suck on until you feel better?

12:41.193 --> 12:42.361
Look at me.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.034
Why did you do it?

12:49.201 --> 12:51.078
They were offering less time.

12:51.829 --> 12:53.789
A lot less time, depending
on how much I gave them.

12:54.706 --> 12:58.336
I hadn't seen or heard
from you in eight years.

12:58.501 --> 13:02.047
You weren't even real anymore,
which made it easier.

13:03.799 --> 13:06.802
And I was pretty sure one of the
other guys would give you up anyway.

13:06.927 --> 13:10.097
And if I'm being really honest,

13:10.181 --> 13:11.765
I was still pissed at you.

13:13.017 --> 13:14.435
For leaving.

13:15.769 --> 13:16.937
For my mom.

13:18.189 --> 13:22.360
So, yeah, at that moment
I probably was just, like,

13:22.485 --> 13:24.403
"Fuck you," you know?

13:26.905 --> 13:28.366
I'm not proud of myself.

13:28.491 --> 13:30.034
You lied to me.

13:31.202 --> 13:32.953
When I first got here
you could've given me

13:33.037 --> 13:34.288
this whole speech right then.

13:35.706 --> 13:37.708
I wanted you to like me.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.711
I still do.

13:41.504 --> 13:44.882
Maybe you should've thought
that all the way through.

13:57.061 --> 13:58.062
Ugh.

13:58.145 --> 13:59.646
This isn't even
remotely coffee.

14:00.356 --> 14:01.940
No, it's dandelions.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.193
Which are loaded
with potassium, man.

14:04.276 --> 14:06.653
Everyone thinks potassium
is all about the bananas,

14:06.737 --> 14:08.613
but that is
banana-lobby bullshit.

14:12.243 --> 14:13.827
She does have a point
about the radio thing,

14:13.911 --> 14:15.538
I'll cop to that.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.415
She's the most interesting
thing about me right now,

14:17.498 --> 14:19.917
and I used that.
Mmm.

14:20.334 --> 14:22.711
And I guess it was a dick move.

14:22.794 --> 14:25.130
But that doesn't make it
okay that she cheated on me.

14:25.339 --> 14:27.466
No, cheating
is a strong word, pal.

14:28.092 --> 14:30.094
Sorry, is there
another word for

14:30.177 --> 14:32.263
"fucking someone other than
the person you promised,

14:32.346 --> 14:34.223
"in the very recent past,

14:34.306 --> 14:36.016
"to fuck exclusively forever"?

14:36.267 --> 14:38.387
Uh, no. I'm just saying that
this "someone" was a girl,

14:38.436 --> 14:39.603
which isn't really cheating.

14:40.687 --> 14:43.607
Like, you and Piper
play squash together.

14:43.732 --> 14:46.944
And if in her downtime she
joins a softball team, then...

14:47.111 --> 14:49.280
That's the bigger problem
with this whole thing.

14:49.405 --> 14:51.115
She fucked a woman.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.242
So what, is she gay now?

14:54.243 --> 14:59.164
I don't know about "now." I just
think that she is what she is, man.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.000
Which is what exactly?

15:02.167 --> 15:04.336
I'm gonna go ahead and guess
that one of the issues here

15:04.462 --> 15:07.923
is your need to say that a
person is exactly anything.

15:13.304 --> 15:15.306
I think it might be over.

15:20.519 --> 15:21.937
Uh...
No offense, Bloomer,

15:22.020 --> 15:24.773
but it's super weird
that I'm in the middle here.

15:26.024 --> 15:27.304
You know,
one of the main reasons

15:27.318 --> 15:29.278
that I live 110 miles
from civilization

15:29.361 --> 15:31.863
is I'm kind of allergic
to other people's drama.

15:31.989 --> 15:35.033
Including, and sometimes especially
when it involves my sister.

15:35.159 --> 15:37.035
That's kind of the whole point,

15:37.161 --> 15:38.496
you know what I'm saying?

15:39.163 --> 15:42.207
Yeah. I know. Uh...
You want me to take off?

15:42.541 --> 15:45.169
No, man. Absolutely chill
here for a few days

15:45.252 --> 15:46.504
if it helps you out.

15:46.629 --> 15:48.255
I would just really
enjoy not being involved

15:48.339 --> 15:51.300
in any kind
of decision-making process.

15:51.383 --> 15:54.064
And respect the limitations of the septic system.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

15:54.136 --> 15:55.887
It's touch-and-go
as it is.

16:00.934 --> 16:01.935
Holy shit.

16:03.687 --> 16:05.022
(YELLING)

16:07.191 --> 16:09.109
Everything okay?
Dude, I'm engaged!

16:27.169 --> 16:29.630
Mr. Caputo, I gotta
make a complaint

16:29.713 --> 16:31.674
about the fungus in
the Spanish showers.

16:31.756 --> 16:32.757
Talk to a CO about that.

16:32.883 --> 16:34.163
I did. They told
me to come to you

16:34.218 --> 16:36.637
because you were the only one that
could deal with this from high up.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.721
(SIGHS)
I bet they did.

16:37.804 --> 16:42.393
I got a serious case
underneath my big toenail.

16:43.018 --> 16:47.398
It is all squishy
and green under there.

16:47.481 --> 16:48.566
As a matter of fact,
let me show you.

16:48.691 --> 16:51.527
No. That will absolutely
not be necessary.

16:51.735 --> 16:54.446
Well, could you at least get Crazy
Eyes over to the light brown side?

16:54.572 --> 16:56.990
I mean, she's keeping the ghetto
cleaner than a nun's chocha, mira.

16:57.074 --> 16:59.743
And another thing,
between my pinkie toe

16:59.826 --> 17:02.413
and my ring toe, it is
bad news, bad news!

17:02.538 --> 17:04.415
So when I go to medical
call and I show them,

17:04.498 --> 17:06.250
they write that shit down,

17:06.333 --> 17:08.877
I gotta let them know
that I told you guys.

17:09.086 --> 17:10.671
What happened
to your shower shoes?

17:10.878 --> 17:12.130
So I just passed out
sitting there like that,

17:12.256 --> 17:14.136
and then when I woke up
my zoris, they were gone,

17:14.174 --> 17:15.217
right off my feet.
(VOCALIZES)

17:15.300 --> 17:19.512
Which reminds me, stealing, that's
another problem we've been having.

17:22.391 --> 17:23.752
Well, what are you
gonna do, right?

17:23.767 --> 17:25.269
At least we got our sanity.

17:26.936 --> 17:29.064
Oh, look at that.
Ten of jack.

17:29.398 --> 17:33.611
Mr. Caputo, I think I heard somebody
crying in the utility closet.

17:33.736 --> 17:34.945
Oh, well, we can't have that.

17:35.028 --> 17:37.072
I'm just saying
'cause we had that suicide

17:37.155 --> 17:38.657
and you know
how these girls are.

17:38.782 --> 17:41.410
They get an idea in their heads
and if you don't watch out

17:41.493 --> 17:44.288
they start offing themselves every
time they get their period.

17:44.371 --> 17:46.665
I know you guys wrote a really
encouraging memo about it,

17:46.790 --> 17:47.874
but truth be told,

17:47.958 --> 17:50.544
I'm not sure
everybody here can read.

17:50.628 --> 17:52.630
I mean, I would
look into it myself

17:52.755 --> 17:54.590
but I got too much empathy.

17:54.715 --> 17:55.924
Lays me low.

17:56.091 --> 17:57.842
If I am not home
in my massage chair

17:57.968 --> 18:00.387
holding a glass of Wild
Turkey in 25 minutes,

18:00.471 --> 18:02.431
I am holding you
personally responsible.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.685
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

18:07.561 --> 18:10.981
Yeah. That's it, baby. Faster.

18:12.816 --> 18:14.526

You seem very chipper
this morning.

18:34.755 --> 18:37.675
My lawyer thinks the judge
is leaning our way.

18:37.758 --> 18:40.051
We find out this afternoon.

18:41.679 --> 18:43.305
Oh, I have something for you.

18:45.516 --> 18:47.058
Well, honestly,
I got it for myself,

18:47.184 --> 18:48.852
but I figured you could use it.

18:50.270 --> 18:51.396
For your special day.

18:51.522 --> 18:53.273
I don't know
if that is my color.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.317
Hold out your hand.

18:58.529 --> 18:59.697
(SIGHS)

19:06.578 --> 19:08.955
You have any big plans
if this all works out?

19:09.414 --> 19:11.416
There is someone
waiting for me.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.377
That is plan enough.

19:13.627 --> 19:16.921
And I'm going to eat
dinner at dinner time.

19:18.131 --> 19:21.343
At 7:00,
like a person.

19:22.636 --> 19:23.637
What do you think?

19:24.888 --> 19:26.390
Pretty.
Hmm.

19:48.161 --> 19:49.287
FIG: Fuck me running.

19:49.413 --> 19:52.249
Are you trying to kill the
warden, Joe, is that it?

19:52.332 --> 19:53.834
Are you trying to lay him
out flat with a stroke?

19:53.917 --> 19:56.086
Because hired fucking assassins

19:56.169 --> 19:57.337
could not be doing
a better job on him

19:57.421 --> 19:59.005
than you are right now.

19:59.381 --> 20:00.674
It was an isolated incident.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.134
Oh, right. Like the
hanging two weeks ago.

20:03.260 --> 20:05.429
Or the maple syrup situation
before that. (SIGHS)

20:05.554 --> 20:07.634

I swear to God.

20:08.766 --> 20:10.601
I can't be everywhere.

20:11.309 --> 20:14.438
You can't blame me
for this scumbag deciding

20:14.563 --> 20:17.107
last night was his go time
to start raping people.

20:17.190 --> 20:19.735
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We are not
talking about a rape here.

20:20.444 --> 20:22.446
We're not using the "R" word.

20:22.529 --> 20:25.699
A CO fucks an inmate
against her will...

20:25.908 --> 20:28.827
Did she scream?
Was she crying?

20:28.952 --> 20:31.371
These girls throwing
themselves at COs

20:31.455 --> 20:32.497
thinking they can
get out of here

20:32.623 --> 20:33.783
and snag a government pension.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.041
Read the rules, Fig.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.127
The girl can't give consent
even if she wants to.

20:37.294 --> 20:42.299
Listen to me. We are not putting
rape on the record right now.

20:43.967 --> 20:47.429
Mendez is gonna take a
little leave without pay.

20:48.639 --> 20:51.809
Uh, the stress of the job is
getting to him, etcetera.

20:52.267 --> 20:55.312
Frankly, we could use the money,
the budget is shot to hell.

20:55.437 --> 20:59.650
I am going to sell this
to the warden as a plus.

21:02.903 --> 21:05.989
It's getting a little old
cleaning up your messes, Joe.

21:18.126 --> 21:19.336
What the hell happened last night?
You okay?

21:19.461 --> 21:20.462
Should you be working?

21:20.545 --> 21:21.588
I'm fine.

Daya, if he hurt you...

21:23.006 --> 21:25.968
Bennett, I'm fine.
And now you're fine, too.

21:27.970 --> 21:29.012
What?

21:29.095 --> 21:31.014
Now, when they find out
I got a baby in me,

21:31.139 --> 21:33.016
it ain't gonna
come down on you.

21:35.519 --> 21:36.603
Oh, my God.

21:37.604 --> 21:39.397
Don't be mad.
You did it on purpose?

21:39.523 --> 21:41.608
Because I love you.
I did it for us.

21:41.775 --> 21:43.777
For us, you fucked Mendez?

21:44.528 --> 21:46.697
And you lied? You got him
suspended without pay.

21:46.864 --> 21:48.239
Suspended?

21:48.365 --> 21:51.284
They ain't fired that fucknut?
He raped me.

21:51.451 --> 21:52.995
He didn't rape you,
you framed him.

21:53.077 --> 21:54.579
Yeah, but as far as they know.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.416
Anyway, it don't matter.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.168
Everything's gonna be okay now.

22:21.690 --> 22:24.401
(SCOFFS) Yeah.
She's probably right.

22:24.526 --> 22:26.846
I'm still getting out from under
the meds that they gave me.

22:27.278 --> 22:28.405
Why?

22:28.530 --> 22:31.073
'Cause you so much as even
squawk about God in here,

22:31.199 --> 22:32.951
and you get thrown in

are everywhere.

wrong, you know?

About what?

22:38.623 --> 22:40.375
Oh, this girl, Chapman?

22:41.585 --> 22:44.629
She made me believe that he'd chose me.
He didn't.

22:44.755 --> 22:47.549
They all disrespecting me,
he didn't do nothing.

22:48.383 --> 22:49.593
He let 'em laugh at me.

22:49.676 --> 22:52.637
Conclusion being that I don't
think he exists at all.

22:52.763 --> 22:55.891

23:10.321 --> 23:12.407
He hasn't abandoned you,

Maybe he just wants you to
notice someone who needs him.

23:15.243 --> 23:16.286
She don't need him, okay?

23:16.369 --> 23:20.457
All she needs is her own self and her
sasquatch of a girlfriend, okay?

23:20.624 --> 23:23.293

because they're unhappy.

23:24.044 --> 23:25.964
Because they feel guilty
over things they've done

and they have no one
to forgive them.

You might as well
tell me to turn into a duck.

23:30.592 --> 23:31.718
'Cause I ain't forgiving her.

23:31.802 --> 23:35.137
I mean, I have to confess that to
you right now, I'm not that big.

23:36.306 --> 23:38.100
God wants you to be that big.

23:38.182 --> 23:40.685
He chose you to be a hero.

25:09.816 --> 25:11.233
I can imagine.

to put an officer on ice,

If you want,
I can help you out.

26:45.662 --> 26:48.832
Be a mentor or something.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.920
You think it would help
if I use a deeper voice?

26:51.001 --> 26:52.585
"Move along, Sister."

26:53.086 --> 26:54.336
It could, sure.

26:54.420 --> 26:57.799
Also, it helps if you
don't use their names.

26:58.216 --> 27:01.970
Just say, "inmate," like
they're all the same to you.

27:02.053 --> 27:04.346
It reminds them
they're not really people.

27:04.973 --> 27:06.016
They are people.

27:07.100 --> 27:08.518
(MUSIC PLAYING)

27:09.186 --> 27:10.228
(SIGHS)

27:11.521 --> 27:14.858
You can't think that way.
They are sheep.

27:15.525 --> 27:19.361
We feed them, we herd them
from one room to the next.

27:21.865 --> 27:23.200
They're not like you.

27:25.243 --> 27:26.328
You're a woman.

27:29.039 --> 27:30.540
And I'm a man.

27:33.793 --> 27:35.545
All right. Got the
bread crumbs, right?

27:35.670 --> 27:37.379
Come back for that.
Take that in.

28:10.663 --> 28:11.915
(CAL LAUGHING)

28:12.374 --> 28:13.624
What the fuck is this?

28:13.750 --> 28:15.085
Oh, don't start with me.

28:15.168 --> 28:17.754
We are done with
factory meat, babe.

28:17.879 --> 28:19.756
There's no reason why
we can't responsibly

28:19.839 --> 28:21.799
hunt all the animal
protein we need.

28:21.925 --> 28:23.009
Yeah, I was hungry.

28:23.176 --> 28:25.178
Is this some
kind of game to you?

28:25.262 --> 28:28.806
I can't even put this in the compost
pile, it'll make the worms sick.

28:28.932 --> 28:31.517
We're 100% on the same page
philosophically, babe,

28:31.601 --> 28:35.605
but I think we really need to
calibrate the intensity factor.

28:35.730 --> 28:37.565
Oh, you think I'm intense? Yeah.

28:37.690 --> 28:38.942
Okay, guess what?
Without me,

28:39.025 --> 28:40.818
all you're doing is
smoking pot in the forest

28:40.944 --> 28:42.653
in a flannel shirt
and a hipster beard,

28:42.779 --> 28:44.488
like a fat Bon Iver,

28:44.614 --> 28:46.908
the fucking Jack
Johnson of Wisconsin.

28:46.991 --> 28:48.618
Whoa! This is exactly
the kind of black-and-white

28:48.701 --> 28:50.287
Holstein shit that
I'm talking about.

28:50.370 --> 28:52.580
Oh, okay. You know
what the problem is?

28:52.663 --> 28:55.083
We are just funda-fucking-mentally
different people,

28:55.166 --> 28:57.252
at a DNA level!

28:57.419 --> 28:59.754
What? Your father is a
financial systems analyst!

28:59.921 --> 29:02.548
Okay, are you fully committed
to living an authentic life,

29:02.632 --> 29:04.301
or are you just acting out some

29:04.426 --> 29:06.010
Hank-Thoreau-at-Walden-Pond
fantasy shit

29:06.136 --> 29:07.637
from seventh grade English?

29:07.804 --> 29:09.806
Why does it matter?
I can't talk to you!

29:14.185 --> 29:15.228
(SIGHS)

29:17.480 --> 29:18.773
Well, that was awkward.

29:20.733 --> 29:21.901
What, awkward how?

29:23.153 --> 29:27.073
It's just tough to watch you
hit the rocks like that, man.

29:28.074 --> 29:31.453
No. That was
foreplay, Bloomer.

29:31.535 --> 29:33.079
Yeah, that's, that's
how we relate.

29:33.246 --> 29:34.705
It seems a little aggressive.

29:34.998 --> 29:38.084
Think about how baby Cal
grew up, all right?

29:38.168 --> 29:40.753
Everyone pretended
everything was chill.

29:40.837 --> 29:44.174
Dad fucked two different
women named Linda,

29:44.257 --> 29:48.552
Mom lived on gin and cottage
cheese from '91 to about '98

29:48.678 --> 29:52.349
and everyone knew and nobody
ever said anything about it.

29:52.432 --> 29:55.893
But with Neri, we put
everything out there, man.

29:56.019 --> 29:57.479
It's safe.

29:57.561 --> 30:00.815
You know, we scream and throw
shit and it's like, electric,

30:00.898 --> 30:03.901
you know what I'm saying?
It's erotic, no joke.

30:04.027 --> 30:06.237
I mean, you get it.
You're a Jew.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.866
All right,
I just got to say it, man.

30:10.574 --> 30:13.786
You guys have known each other
what, nine weeks, tops?

30:14.287 --> 30:15.913
Isn't the whole
thing a little fast?

30:16.164 --> 30:17.581
Oh, okay.

30:18.582 --> 30:20.210
(CLEARS THROAT) Maybe it
doesn't look like what

30:20.293 --> 30:21.894
everyone else thinks
it should look like,

30:21.919 --> 30:23.421
but who cares?

30:24.214 --> 30:27.884
We're crazy,
but we are in this.

30:39.979 --> 30:41.731
They said the video
machine got unhooked.

30:42.440 --> 30:45.568
There's this, uh,
Guatemalan grandma

30:45.693 --> 30:49.489
who's been teaching herself
English watching Turner and Hooch

30:49.572 --> 30:53.743
about six times a day. I'm
guessing someone got tired of it.

30:55.912 --> 30:57.372
I came by yoga today.

30:58.789 --> 30:59.790
Oh.

31:00.624 --> 31:03.086
Well, I'm taking
a little break.

31:03.753 --> 31:05.296
I thought yoga
was a little break.

31:05.755 --> 31:06.964
It was.

31:07.924 --> 31:09.217
Then I hit you.

31:10.343 --> 31:12.512
You can only take so
much Zen, you know?

31:12.595 --> 31:15.973
Sometimes you
wanna feel something.

31:18.476 --> 31:20.186
You gotta talk
about it sometime.

31:25.983 --> 31:31.281
I used to grow marijuana out in
California, Humboldt County.

31:31.406 --> 31:33.283
One acre, nothing crazy.

31:33.408 --> 31:35.410
Just enough to keep me going.

31:35.952 --> 31:37.120
Goin', like, baked?

31:37.203 --> 31:38.662
Like, pay the rent.

31:39.247 --> 31:41.791
I mean, I smoked it
once in a while.

31:41.874 --> 31:46.837
But mostly I was just a
good old-fashioned drunk,

31:46.963 --> 31:49.090
like my parents
raised me to be.

31:50.091 --> 31:51.509
So the Feds shut you down.

31:51.675 --> 31:53.595
Actually, it was the deer.

31:54.471 --> 31:55.513
The who, now?

31:56.847 --> 31:59.058
Oh, yeah, deer love weed.
(CHUCKLES)

31:59.142 --> 32:00.184
Fucks them right up, too.

32:00.310 --> 32:03.771
They start jumping around
all over the place.

32:03.854 --> 32:05.815
Then they come back for more.

32:05.940 --> 32:08.151
And the kicker is,
you can't keep them out.

32:08.234 --> 32:13.197
I tried everything.
Soap shavings, fox pee,

32:13.323 --> 32:16.826
which they sell at the Home
Depot for $120 a gallon.

32:16.951 --> 32:18.828
Seems like you could
have just built a fence.

32:18.953 --> 32:22.706
No, a deer can jump an
eight-foot barb wire fence

32:22.832 --> 32:26.169
with a smile on its face,
like Donald O'Connor.

32:26.877 --> 32:28.254
Get to the meat already.

32:31.215 --> 32:36.513
I got a hunting rifle
and stayed up all night,

32:36.638 --> 32:39.307
four, five times a week.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.267
And finally, one night

32:41.351 --> 32:46.856
I see them rustling around
the edge of my property,

32:46.981 --> 32:50.360
where I was growing
the quality shit,

32:50.443 --> 32:53.737
this hybrid
plant called AK-47,

32:53.863 --> 32:56.866
which the fake
prescription people

32:56.991 --> 32:59.410
eat up like peanuts.
I was pissed.

32:59.577 --> 33:00.578
And drunk?

33:00.703 --> 33:02.372
Oh, honey, that goes
without saying.

33:03.164 --> 33:04.332
So what happened?

33:06.668 --> 33:08.002
I shot him.

33:10.296 --> 33:11.339
And?

33:12.798 --> 33:14.592
And it wasn't a deer.

33:17.637 --> 33:21.724
It was an eight-year-old kid

33:23.059 --> 33:27.104
from the farm next door who
was running away from home

33:27.230 --> 33:31.568
because his dad
took away his Nintendo.

33:34.445 --> 33:35.446
(SIGHS)

33:35.572 --> 33:37.073
A kid.

33:39.367 --> 33:40.451
Shit.

33:40.910 --> 33:47.500
And they buried him on
their property, in a box.

33:47.584 --> 33:48.585
(CHUCKLES)

33:51.128 --> 33:55.174
Work hours means no socializing
whatsoever, inmates.

33:55.341 --> 33:57.134
It was a mistake.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.802
Oh, no.

34:00.263 --> 34:01.514
We're having a moment here.

34:01.723 --> 34:04.434
Shit. I'm sorry.
Carry on.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.400
POUSSEY: I don't even
know what Kwanzaa is.

34:13.484 --> 34:14.527
I mean, except
that you're supposed

34:14.610 --> 34:16.612
to wear dashikis and
eat corn and stuff.

34:16.737 --> 34:18.572
BLACK CINDY: Nobody
knows what it is, girl.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.283
But they're taking
Fed money up in here,

34:20.408 --> 34:23.286
so they gotta give all the
traditions equal time.

34:23.411 --> 34:24.704
Hey, you know what?

34:24.786 --> 34:27.290
I think I'm gonna be needin' a
traditional week off from work.

34:27.373 --> 34:30.083
Hey! To honor my African
roots, you feel me?

34:30.208 --> 34:33.379
Uh, huh. Joyous Kwanzaa,
my Nubian sister.

34:33.463 --> 34:35.380
(VOCALIZING)
(LAUGHING)

34:35.465 --> 34:38.676
May the Kwanzaa
Elf smile upon ya!

34:41.094 --> 34:42.304
And pull it through the loop.

34:42.388 --> 34:44.599
And you got
a single crochet stitch.

34:44.681 --> 34:45.808
Ah, ha, ha, ha!
Look at that!

34:45.933 --> 34:47.476
Ninety-five thousand
more of those

34:47.601 --> 34:49.395
and you'll have a lovely throw.
(CHUCKLES)

34:49.603 --> 34:52.482
Hey, college,
I got words for you.

35:03.951 --> 35:06.454
All right, I'm just gonna give
it to you straight, college,

35:06.537 --> 35:10.833
I've been harboring some really
bad hate in my heart for you.

35:12.084 --> 35:13.670
But I saved you. I got
you out of Psych.

35:13.836 --> 35:16.255
You saved me from some
shit you got me into.

35:17.340 --> 35:18.882
Don't be surprised
if there's not

35:19.008 --> 35:20.677
a national holiday
declared in your name.

35:20.802 --> 35:22.553
You got me
thrown into the SHU...

35:22.679 --> 35:24.096
Who's talkin' right now?

35:27.684 --> 35:29.977
Do you realize that
you almost ruined my life?

35:30.060 --> 35:31.895
I mean, do you?

35:32.021 --> 35:34.691
You made the Almighty God
into a joke,

35:34.774 --> 35:36.984
and a joke ain't nothing to me.

35:37.151 --> 35:40.488
A joke didn't write
me letters up in here,

35:40.571 --> 35:45.159
and a joke didn't give me hope
so I could do my time

35:45.242 --> 35:47.495
and make something out of it.

35:49.539 --> 35:51.290
What do you believe in?

35:55.044 --> 35:57.963
Well, I've always thought that
agnostic was sort of a cop-out.

35:58.047 --> 36:00.216
But you know,
if I had to label it,

36:00.299 --> 36:02.009
I'd say that I'm
a secular humanist.

36:02.092 --> 36:03.177
Which is not to say
I'm not spiritual...

36:03.260 --> 36:05.471
You're not religious, okay?
Just stop.

36:06.848 --> 36:08.098
Stop.

36:08.932 --> 36:10.643
You believe in Hussein Obama?

36:11.561 --> 36:13.855
Electric cars and
Shakespeare books

36:13.937 --> 36:16.065
and do you go out to
eat at restaurants?

36:18.234 --> 36:21.654
I don't have any of that, okay?
All I have is him.

36:22.321 --> 36:23.489
I'm sorry.

36:23.573 --> 36:26.701
Don't ask for my forgiveness. You
should ask for His forgiveness.

36:26.784 --> 36:28.745
You need to get right with him,

36:28.828 --> 36:32.289
and then we'll see that all
this was part of His plan.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.333
And then, we don't
have to fight anymore.

36:34.417 --> 36:36.419
I wasn't planning on fighting with you.
Well, then, just do it.

36:36.544 --> 36:37.587
Right now? Yeah, right
here, right now.

36:37.712 --> 36:38.755
Got somewhere to be?

36:45.386 --> 36:46.429
Dear Jesus...

36:46.554 --> 36:48.138
That's awfully
familiar for somebody

36:48.264 --> 36:50.140
that doesn't give
him the time of day.

36:50.433 --> 36:51.434
Um...

36:52.351 --> 36:55.563
Dear Mr. Christ?

37:00.067 --> 37:01.694
Dear Mr. Christ,

37:02.612 --> 37:07.491
I know that I've done
some things recently

37:07.658 --> 37:12.455
that have not been, have
been up to your standards.

37:13.456 --> 37:16.667
And I feel pretty ashamed.

37:20.129 --> 37:22.214
It's really easy
to point fingers.

37:23.507 --> 37:27.386
And I've done some things lately
I feel pretty lousy about.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.558
And I'm wondering if maybe you could
make things right between us?

37:32.642 --> 37:33.976
Meaning forgiveness?

37:36.353 --> 37:39.816
If I could be forgiven,
that would be really...

37:41.024 --> 37:42.025
Um...

37:44.153 --> 37:46.322
That would be
really comforting.

37:47.448 --> 37:48.699
Amen.

37:53.329 --> 37:54.413
How was that?

37:55.205 --> 37:58.125
I think you took a step
on the right road.

37:59.084 --> 38:00.127
Okay.

38:01.086 --> 38:02.087
(LAUGHING)

38:05.215 --> 38:06.884
Now we just gotta
get you baptized.

38:10.262 --> 38:13.891
I would've looped in the Blessed
Virgin to cover my bases.

38:14.016 --> 38:15.058
But that's me.

38:18.855 --> 38:20.356
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

38:20.481 --> 38:21.774
MAN: Let's try again.

38:26.028 --> 38:27.488
Thanks for coming.

38:28.030 --> 38:29.323
What do you want?

38:29.782 --> 38:33.035
Wow, way to harsh on a dude
when he's down, bro, fuck!

38:33.202 --> 38:36.163
You put your dick in Diaz!

38:36.246 --> 38:40.042
It's not what it sounds like, man.
She wanted me to do it.

38:42.419 --> 38:47.049
Hey, Benny, I think
we're in love.

38:49.385 --> 38:51.387
(EXHALES)
You poor fucker.

38:51.470 --> 38:52.930
Yep.

38:53.681 --> 38:57.894
That's okay. I mean,
if we have to spend

38:57.977 --> 38:59.896
a little bit of time apart,
I can handle that.

39:02.398 --> 39:04.400
I gotta get her a message.

39:06.652 --> 39:07.778
Will you take it?

39:07.904 --> 39:10.364
I could get in
deep shit for that.

39:10.447 --> 39:13.534
Plus, it's not good for you, man.
It's not healthy.

39:14.410 --> 39:16.787
You need a girl who you
can actually be with.

39:18.748 --> 39:20.249
I'm gonna help you out, Benny.

39:21.375 --> 39:22.543
Perfect.

39:22.626 --> 39:25.170
We've got a shipment
coming in tomorrow

39:25.254 --> 39:28.591
from this vendor
called Neptune's Produce.

39:29.008 --> 39:32.135
Stop the truck, get into
it before they unload it.

39:32.261 --> 39:34.137
Look for a box with a
check mark on the side.

39:34.263 --> 39:35.765
Look, I don't wanna be
involved in anything weird.

39:35.848 --> 39:36.933
It's not weird, it's drugs.

39:39.810 --> 39:43.272
Sputnik in the kitchen
is dealing to the inmates,

39:43.355 --> 39:45.524
turning them into addicts.
It's wrong.

39:46.650 --> 39:51.154
You get that box, bring it to
Caputo, he's gonna be grateful.

39:51.280 --> 39:54.992
Butter him up, he'll probably give
you a raise right on the spot.

39:55.117 --> 39:58.746
We could all use a little
extra cash, am I right?

40:02.332 --> 40:06.420
I was gonna be the hero, but I'm
gonna give you my win, man.

40:08.005 --> 40:09.506
It's your win now.

40:10.466 --> 40:11.508
Why?

40:13.719 --> 40:14.971
Satisfaction.

40:19.809 --> 40:21.435
And this.

40:24.647 --> 40:26.398
I'm not saying yes.

40:28.985 --> 40:32.237
But you will, because
you're my brother.

40:47.252 --> 40:48.420
Fuck.

40:50.380 --> 40:51.882
PIPER: You were right.

40:53.634 --> 40:55.094
About Larry, you were right.

40:58.430 --> 41:00.975
I think that I've lost him.
Can I?

41:04.061 --> 41:06.147
(MAN ANNOUNCING OVER PA)

41:06.981 --> 41:08.149
(SIGHS)

41:08.440 --> 41:10.985
So all of my cards
are on the table.

41:13.029 --> 41:14.363
Everything.

41:15.322 --> 41:17.658
I'm an emotionally
manipulative narcissist

41:17.741 --> 41:20.327
who bailed on you
when your mother died.

41:22.204 --> 41:25.833
And I'm a ruthless pragmatist who
sold you out and then lied about it.

41:29.045 --> 41:30.462
We suck.
(CHUCKLES)

41:32.006 --> 41:33.567
It's kind of a relief,
though, isn't it?

41:34.884 --> 41:37.553
Oh, my God, Piper!
I'm getting whiplash here.

41:37.887 --> 41:39.722
I'm not fucking with you.

41:41.431 --> 41:45.561
I've ruined my life now,
twice, over you.

41:47.563 --> 41:50.816
So, what's the end game here?

41:50.900 --> 41:53.402
When we get out of
prison what's the plan?

41:54.570 --> 41:57.614
Are we gonna move to Vermont and open
a pottery studio and wear Tevas?

41:57.781 --> 41:59.421
(CHUCKLES) That sounds
more like Santa Fe.

41:59.491 --> 42:02.244
I'm being serious.
Are you gonna get a job?

42:02.327 --> 42:03.328
Hmm...

42:03.412 --> 42:05.122
Like a regular person?

42:05.247 --> 42:07.708
I mean, I can't even imagine
what that would look like.

42:07.875 --> 42:09.251
Me neither.

42:10.878 --> 42:13.797
I'm good at moving
large amounts of heroin.

42:14.256 --> 42:16.926
Like, really fucking
brilliant at it.

42:17.801 --> 42:19.720
Other than that, I don't know.

42:21.013 --> 42:22.253
One thing that I
do know is that

42:22.305 --> 42:24.892
I am never, ever
coming back to prison.

42:25.809 --> 42:29.646
Listen, I am not planning on going
back to doing illegal shit.

42:29.772 --> 42:32.024
I'm not planning anything.

42:32.108 --> 42:35.152
I don't know
what's gonna happen,

42:35.277 --> 42:36.904
and that's the point
of being with me.

42:37.613 --> 42:40.323
If you wanna have babies
and remodel your bathroom,

42:40.449 --> 42:43.827
then, please go.
Do. Nest.

42:46.122 --> 42:48.290
If you wanna do X on
a beach in Cambodia

42:48.415 --> 42:50.542
with three strangers in drag...

42:52.461 --> 42:57.883
I'm not saying it's gonna
happen, but it could.

43:03.013 --> 43:04.473
I love Cambodia.

43:05.891 --> 43:07.309
Me too.

43:15.985 --> 43:18.862
Chapman, you blinked.
Vause wins.

43:18.988 --> 43:20.447
Yo, you seen her yet?

43:20.530 --> 43:21.573
Who?

43:21.949 --> 43:24.660
Princess Stephanie of Monaco.
Your roommate.

43:25.744 --> 43:28.330
Lorna drove her back up,
you haven't heard?

43:28.413 --> 43:32.251
Her appeal went kaput. Better sleep
with both eyes open tonight.

43:34.544 --> 43:36.005
Oh, shit.

43:42.928 --> 43:46.389
Inmate, where's your badge?
Inmate, I'm talking to you.

43:46.515 --> 43:49.977
That nail polish is non-regulation, too.
Where did you get that?

43:50.060 --> 43:53.230
I said, where did you get that?

43:55.107 --> 43:56.525
(GASPING)

44:01.071 --> 44:02.447
Take your hands
off her, Pelage.

44:06.285 --> 44:07.619
You're headed to Max, inmate.

44:08.704 --> 44:09.705
Doesn't matter.

Come on, you.

44:28.390 --> 44:29.391
What we lookin' at?

44:29.558 --> 44:30.726
Taystee?

44:42.863 --> 44:45.490
You ain't got to
be alone no more.

44:47.326 --> 44:48.409
What is this?

44:48.535 --> 44:51.038
This is me never having
to make mac and cheese

44:51.121 --> 44:52.873
in the common room
microwave again.

44:52.956 --> 44:54.396
It smells like
a salmon farted in it.

44:54.541 --> 44:56.461
You don't know when Miss
Claudette is coming back.

44:56.501 --> 45:00.463
You put your hand on a guard, you
go to Max, you don't come back.

45:00.589 --> 45:02.216
Everybody know that.

45:02.591 --> 45:05.969
We goin' to my bunk, where
Book of Eli never happened.

45:09.181 --> 45:10.349
Hey!

45:11.641 --> 45:12.851
Hey, I get the blanket.

45:13.018 --> 45:14.603
Well, look at you, Miss Thing.

45:16.605 --> 45:21.610
I was her roommate. I took her
shit and I listened to her snore.

45:22.611 --> 45:24.947
The blanket is mine.

45:25.614 --> 45:26.698
I've got three of them.

45:27.408 --> 45:30.202
Kill, Little Boo, kill!

45:33.372 --> 45:35.165
We're working on it.

45:37.251 --> 45:38.585
Good girl.

46:08.407 --> 46:09.574
You wanna talk about it?

46:10.491 --> 46:11.701
Not really.

46:12.702 --> 46:14.063
I have to give
you a titty-twister,

46:14.079 --> 46:15.559
you'll be feelin'
that shit next week.

46:17.166 --> 46:19.168
What they don't tell
you when you get out?

46:19.293 --> 46:21.462
They gonna be up
your ass like the KGB.

46:21.544 --> 46:24.923
Curfew every night, piss in
a cup whenever they say,

46:25.007 --> 46:28.677
you gotta do three job interviews in
a week for jobs you never gonna get.

46:29.219 --> 46:32.014

every minute, checkin' up.

46:32.473 --> 46:34.766
Man, at least in jail
you get dinner.

46:37.978 --> 46:39.355
Ow, man!
What the fuck?

46:39.438 --> 46:41.198
Man, where do you
think you at, Paris Hilton?

46:42.232 --> 46:44.525
Yo, it's bitches in
here doing 15 years

46:44.609 --> 46:46.649
for lettin' their boyfriends
do deals in the kitchen

46:46.695 --> 46:49.781
'cause they was afraid of
getting beat if they said no.

46:49.865 --> 46:52.345
And there's bitches ain't seen
their kids since they was babies,

46:52.368 --> 46:54.370
and them kids got
they own babies now,

46:54.495 --> 46:56.815
or they're runnin' around the
street carryin' guns and shit,

46:56.872 --> 46:58.915
no one watching over 'em.

46:59.124 --> 47:04.004
Yo, I been in here two years
and I got four more.

47:04.880 --> 47:07.383
Eight months ago when
I was waxin' fuckin'

47:07.466 --> 47:10.635
floors in the cafeteria,
my moms passed.

47:12.179 --> 47:13.930
And I wasn't there to say
the shit you supposed to say

47:14.056 --> 47:15.556
to your mom before she gone.

47:15.891 --> 47:18.519
So I know you ain't tellin'
me in my face right now

47:18.601 --> 47:20.145
that you walked
back in this place

47:20.229 --> 47:22.563
'cause freedom was
inconvenient for you?

47:22.689 --> 47:26.235
It ain't like that, P. Minimum
wage is some kinda joke.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.070
I got part-time
workin' at Pizza Hut,

47:28.153 --> 47:31.240
and I still owe the prison
$900 in fees I gotta pay back.

47:32.074 --> 47:34.243
I ain't got no place to stay.

47:34.575 --> 47:39.122
I was sleepin' on the floor in my
second cousin apartment like a dog,

47:39.580 --> 47:42.501
and she still got six
people in two rooms.

47:42.583 --> 47:46.255
One of the bitches stole my check.
I got lice.

47:46.380 --> 47:50.591
Everyone I know is poor,
in jail, or gone.

47:52.010 --> 47:54.804
Don't nobody ask
about how my day went.

47:54.930 --> 47:57.598
Man, I got fucked up
in the head, you know?

48:00.436 --> 48:02.396
I know how to play it here.

48:02.479 --> 48:05.941
Where to be, and what
rules to follow.

48:07.817 --> 48:09.361
I got a bed.

48:10.779 --> 48:12.655
And I got you.

48:14.324 --> 48:15.534
I really missed you.

48:20.621 --> 48:22.874
I didn't mean to let you down.

48:31.300 --> 48:34.886
So what did you do to land
yourself back in here?

48:35.304 --> 48:40.850
(CHUCKLES) Well, first, I got a can
of Rockstar and 100 paper clips.

48:41.143 --> 48:42.478
(BOTH LAUGHING)

48:45.814 --> 48:48.275
I found it in the shed
behind Electrical.

48:49.109 --> 48:51.987
If they see us with that, we
both go straight to the SHU.

48:52.404 --> 48:54.406
So don't let them see us.

48:55.616 --> 48:57.658
What kind of voltage are
we talking about here?

48:58.076 --> 49:00.954
No idea. That's what
makes it exciting.

49:02.372 --> 49:04.916
You don't wanna
do it, that's cool.

49:05.041 --> 49:07.628
We just go back to our
regular, prison lives.

49:08.378 --> 49:11.507
Work, sleep, count.

49:22.683 --> 49:23.684
(GRUNTS)

49:24.019 --> 49:26.938
Shit. Oh, my God!
Wait, come on, Jones.

49:33.612 --> 49:39.242
Oh, man! I didn't think it was like that.
Shit. I'm sorry.

49:40.952 --> 49:42.745
No, it's cool.

49:44.039 --> 49:48.084
I feel good.
I feel better.

49:50.629 --> 49:51.880
You're serious?

49:53.215 --> 49:54.550
I kind of needed that.

49:59.388 --> 50:01.640
Here, you gonna go?

50:06.311 --> 50:10.357
You ready to get dunked? I got
towels so don't worry about that.

50:10.815 --> 50:15.278
Oh, God, the baptism thing.
You were serious.

50:15.612 --> 50:18.615
What about me makes you think
I wouldn't be serious?

50:19.115 --> 50:21.076
Good point. Uh...

50:21.368 --> 50:23.412
I have visitation today.
It's Larry's day.

50:23.537 --> 50:26.039
Or was. We haven't talked but I'm
really hoping he'll be there.

50:26.122 --> 50:28.917
So just go after.
This takes a few minutes.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.878
And that's not a lot of time to get
your ticket to the Kingdom of Heaven,

50:31.961 --> 50:36.049
which is forever
and ever, amen.

50:39.302 --> 50:41.054
Wow. (CHUCKLES)

50:41.137 --> 50:44.933
That was a sign. I think
he's back on my side.

50:46.851 --> 50:48.562
How did you sleep, Tiffany?

50:48.645 --> 50:49.770
Who's askin'?

50:49.896 --> 50:51.147
I'm your lawyer.

50:51.273 --> 50:53.873
You ain't my lawyer. My lawyer is
fat and his name is Wesley Weeks.

50:53.900 --> 50:55.902
Wesley Weeks is a
C-minus public defender

50:55.985 --> 50:58.280
who will plead you out without
even looking at your file.

50:58.363 --> 51:00.990
I think you'll find that the Christian
firm of Turro, Payne and Whorton

51:01.116 --> 51:02.596
will serve your
interests much better.

51:04.453 --> 51:05.693
You're gonna get
me out of jail?

51:05.704 --> 51:07.956
Well, if you shoot somebody in
broad daylight, with witnesses,

51:08.081 --> 51:09.666
you're gonna do some
time, that's a fact.

51:09.790 --> 51:12.961
But, I will see
that you do less time.

51:13.420 --> 51:14.963
Couple of
procedural challenges,

51:15.046 --> 51:16.465
plus we're gonna
argue that you did

51:16.548 --> 51:18.300
what you did based on
the moral conviction

51:18.425 --> 51:20.218
that you were saving lives.

51:20.302 --> 51:23.639
Defenseless, innocent lives.
I didn't...

51:23.764 --> 51:24.973
(SHUSHING)

51:25.098 --> 51:26.767
I can't afford a fancy lawyer.

51:26.933 --> 51:28.560
My fees have
already been settled.

51:28.644 --> 51:31.146
And there's a small monthly
stipend going to your family,

51:31.271 --> 51:33.191
to help them while their
daughter serves her time.

51:34.608 --> 51:35.816
How's this being paid for?

51:36.693 --> 51:38.445
By the grace of God.

51:39.195 --> 51:42.157
And also, all your friends.

order in this courtroom!

All of you, sit down!

52:08.684 --> 52:10.851
Look, I understand that
this is important to you,

52:10.977 --> 52:12.688
but I don't think...
College?

52:14.356 --> 52:15.732
Don't let me down.

52:17.858 --> 52:20.487
Okay, fine.
Fine, I have 10 minutes.

52:21.196 --> 52:22.238
Perfect.

needed this, Bennett.

52:27.952 --> 52:29.037
Just doing my job, sir.

52:29.162 --> 52:31.373
This is the kind of
thing I remember when

52:31.498 --> 52:33.834
it's time to move
somebody up the ladder.

52:33.916 --> 52:38.505
That kitchen Commie cunt
is finally going down.

52:40.674 --> 52:41.924
Oh, man!

52:43.301 --> 52:44.344
Beautiful!

52:47.389 --> 52:48.390
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

52:48.473 --> 52:50.058
I have a whole life
in front of me.

52:50.225 --> 52:54.187
I don't want to spend it
watching "Storage Wars"

52:54.855 --> 52:57.357
She's bored. You should
take her out more.

52:57.524 --> 52:59.526
Well, maybe I would take her out more
if she didn't flirt with other men.

52:59.609 --> 53:00.569
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

53:00.694 --> 53:02.571
Have you been
acting like a slut?

53:03.279 --> 53:04.823
I have a body!

53:04.947 --> 53:07.450
I can't help it if people look.

53:07.659 --> 53:10.245
She says it's not her fault
if other people look at her.

53:10.370 --> 53:11.705
Maybe you're too jealous.

53:12.121 --> 53:14.165
All I want is a nice quiet
life, is that so much to ask?

53:14.249 --> 53:15.250
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

53:15.375 --> 53:17.335
He wants peace and quiet.

53:19.045 --> 53:21.798
He's got a
government job, dummy.

53:22.048 --> 53:23.633
It could be much worse.

53:27.429 --> 53:30.265
His toenails scratch me in bed.

53:31.600 --> 53:33.435
Okay, you have to
get a pedicure.

53:33.560 --> 53:35.520
The long toenails are a problem.

Caputo wants to see you.

53:38.857 --> 53:41.276
I'm busy. I'd go
now if I were you.

53:45.363 --> 53:47.407
That little bitch Mendez.

53:49.284 --> 53:51.327
Couldn't go down like a man.

53:51.494 --> 53:52.995
I'm confused here.

53:56.040 --> 53:59.335
If it goes bad,
take care of my girls.

54:01.212 --> 54:02.963
Bennett, explain
this immediately.

54:05.300 --> 54:06.340
Bennett!
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

54:06.426 --> 54:09.262
I need to talk about
grocery money.

54:12.808 --> 54:13.934
Behold!
(CHEERING)

54:14.058 --> 54:17.771
I bring the lost
sheep back to the 99.

54:18.146 --> 54:21.232
All right, as you know, we don't
have a river to dunk you in,

54:21.316 --> 54:23.109
but we cleaned
out the muck sink.

54:23.192 --> 54:25.528
And yeah, you might just
wanna take off your shirt.

54:25.695 --> 54:27.906
Okay! Nope, see,
I can't do this.

54:27.988 --> 54:29.240
I'm sorry.

54:29.324 --> 54:31.242
I really want us to get
along, I do, but I can't

54:31.326 --> 54:32.702
pretend to believe
in something I don't.

54:32.828 --> 54:34.454
And I don't.

54:34.621 --> 54:36.748
Chapman, we've all
had our doubts.

54:36.915 --> 54:38.999
No, see, this isn't doubts.

54:39.626 --> 54:43.505
I believe in science,
I believe in evolution.

54:43.672 --> 54:44.798
I believe in Nate Silver

54:44.881 --> 54:46.842
and Neil deGrasse Tyson
and Christopher Hitchens,

54:46.925 --> 54:49.009
although I do admit, he could
be kind of an asshole.

54:50.470 --> 54:52.054
I cannot get behind
some supreme being

54:52.180 --> 54:53.556
who weighs in on
the Tony Awards

54:53.682 --> 54:55.562
while a million people
get wacked with machetes.

54:55.642 --> 54:57.644
I don't believe a billion
Indians are going to hell,

54:57.727 --> 55:00.020
I don't think we get cancer
to learn life lessons,

55:00.146 --> 55:01.747
and I don't believe
that people die young

55:01.773 --> 55:03.191
because God
needs another angel.

55:03.316 --> 55:06.152
I think it's just bullshit, and on
some level, I think we all know that.

55:06.235 --> 55:07.529
I mean, don't you?

55:08.738 --> 55:11.157
The angel thing does
seem kind of desperate.

55:11.908 --> 55:13.068
I thought you was a Christian.

55:14.202 --> 55:17.205
I am, but I got some questions.

55:20.166 --> 55:23.252
PIPER: Look, I understand
that religion makes it easier

55:23.378 --> 55:27.047
to deal with all of the random
shitty things that happen to us.

55:28.299 --> 55:32.345
And I wish I could get on that
ride, I'm sure I would be happier.

55:34.806 --> 55:35.891
But I can't.

55:37.183 --> 55:40.896
Feelings aren't enough.
I need it to be real.

55:41.646 --> 55:43.023
I gotta go.

55:43.272 --> 55:45.107
I tried to be your friend.

55:46.150 --> 55:48.444
I hope he makes you very happy.

55:50.279 --> 55:51.573
Excuse me.

55:52.741 --> 55:53.909
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

55:53.992 --> 55:55.075
Hello?

55:55.201 --> 55:56.703
ANDREW: I'm looking for
Natalie Figueroa.

55:56.786 --> 55:57.913
You found her.

55:58.038 --> 55:59.414
Ms. Figueroa,
this is Andrew Nance

55:59.497 --> 56:01.750
calling from The City Post,
online edition.

56:01.875 --> 56:05.085
I recently caught a public radio
interview with Larry Bloom.

56:05.169 --> 56:08.590
He's engaged to a Litchfield
inmate named Piper Chapman?

56:08.757 --> 56:10.842
I'm sorry, I've never
heard of this person.

56:10.926 --> 56:12.594
Oh. Well in his interview,

56:12.677 --> 56:14.971
Mr. Bloom mentioned some cutbacks
at Litchfield this year.

56:15.095 --> 56:17.974
The closing of the track, for instance,
the GED program shutting down,

56:18.098 --> 56:20.602
medications switched to generics,
those kinds of things.

56:20.727 --> 56:23.448
All of which seem to have been
attributed to budgetary considerations?

56:23.563 --> 56:25.941
Well, we do the best
with what we've got,

56:26.066 --> 56:28.359
but there's always a bottom
line to consider, obviously.

56:28.526 --> 56:30.319
I understand that, obviously.

56:30.445 --> 56:33.281
But, I did some digging into the
budget allocation for New York

56:33.406 --> 56:35.617
and as it turns out, Litchfield
actually got an increase

56:35.700 --> 56:39.161
over the last five
years of $2.3 million.

56:40.622 --> 56:43.750
So, what I'm wondering is,
where did all that money go?

56:46.335 --> 56:48.128
I'll have to look into that.

56:48.337 --> 56:49.737
As I understand it,
you're in charge

56:49.798 --> 56:51.131
of day-to-day
operations at the prison...

56:51.257 --> 56:53.217
I said I'd look into it.

57:06.314 --> 57:08.148
I'm really glad
that you're here.

57:13.321 --> 57:15.531
Listen, neither of us understood
how crazy this was gonna be.

57:15.657 --> 57:17.575
We thought, "Sure,
we'll get married after."

57:17.659 --> 57:19.619
Like, we were just gonna
pick up where we left off.

57:21.830 --> 57:26.250
But, Piper, this, this is
changing you, it's changing me.

57:28.544 --> 57:29.963
You didn't ask for any of this.

57:30.212 --> 57:33.133
No. But we're here.

57:35.343 --> 57:37.470
It's messy and weird

57:38.554 --> 57:42.558
and we're gonna do stupid and
lonely and embarrassing shit.

57:42.684 --> 57:45.854
And either we
can do it together,

57:45.937 --> 57:48.356
get married, now,
in this room, possibly,

57:48.439 --> 57:49.879
as soon as we can
file the paperwork,

57:49.899 --> 57:53.235
and do it as
husband and wife or...

58:00.035 --> 58:01.119
Or we have to break up.

58:01.202 --> 58:03.705
Because this thing that we're
doing now, this in-between?

58:05.498 --> 58:06.541
I can't.

58:09.752 --> 58:10.962
So,

58:14.549 --> 58:16.300
what do you say?

58:21.263 --> 58:23.058
PENNSATUCKY:
You know what I got to do.

58:23.141 --> 58:24.600
Hmm? Hmm?

58:24.726 --> 58:26.186
She disrespected me.

58:26.435 --> 58:28.354
ALL: Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

58:28.980 --> 58:30.398
Now,

58:31.440 --> 58:33.735
I'm gonna have to kill her.
