19:23.204 --> 19:26.582
By any chance did they
also call Steve

19:26.582 --> 19:28.041
"The Boob Grazer?"

19:28.041 --> 19:29.668
No. Why?

19:29.668 --> 19:32.003
Just curious.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.516
Hey,paisan!
It's good to see you.

19:44.516 --> 19:49.145
Oh, how's your mother?
You give her my regards, okay?

19:49.145 --> 19:53.275
Oh, this two,
always with this two.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.945
Ah. Good people.
Good.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.780
Can I get you
something to drink?

19:58.780 --> 20:01.908
Yeah. Chianti for me
and the little lady.

20:01.908 --> 20:03.994
We don't have that.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.162
Oh!

20:07.080 --> 20:09.165
Coffee, thanks.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.586
Okay, enough, huh?
Stop acting like that.

20:12.586 --> 20:17.216
Acting like what? She's busting
my balls over here.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.593
Like that!

20:19.593 --> 20:20.386
Look, I went out with you

20:20.386 --> 20:22.012
because I thought
you were different

20:22.012 --> 20:24.223
from all the other goons
I've dated.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.100
The mouth on this one.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.353
Russell, if I wanted
a guy like this,

20:29.353 --> 20:31.480
I'd go for the real thing,
okay?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.358
Not some pathetic
tracksuit wannabe.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.734
Hey, show some respect.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.444
The name is "Two Calls."

20:37.444 --> 20:40.155
Should've been
"Dropped Call."

20:41.615 --> 20:44.326
I'll see ya, loser.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.912
Oh!

20:49.456 --> 20:51.708
Oh.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.423
Grilled cheese
and a pickle.
