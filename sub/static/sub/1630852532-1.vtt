00:02.302 --> 00:05.004
[Bindi] It's crazy, crazy,
crazy hot!

00:05.638 --> 00:07.673
I love you.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.009
- [Chandler] Hello!
- Hi, dada!

00:10.011 --> 00:11.543
Oh, you're very sleepy,
aren't you?

00:11.545 --> 00:14.580
- Hi, Dada!
- So sleepy.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.715
[Bindi] Shall we go out
for a walk?

00:16.717 --> 00:21.653
<i>Motherhood has been the
greatest adventure of my entire life.</i>

00:24.157 --> 00:26.725
<i>Grace is now three months old.</i>

00:26.727 --> 00:29.795
And she is... amazing.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.264
What does this bit do?

00:32.266 --> 00:34.033
No, it's her antenna.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.468
- It's stylish.
- She's like, "No. don't touch that."

00:36.470 --> 00:39.238
- What do you think of the world?
- Wow.

00:39.240 --> 00:44.276
She's so cute because she
smiles with her whole body.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.178
Guys, smile.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.281
- Yay!
- Look at that smile!

00:51.584 --> 00:54.219
<i>[Bindi] I love that everyday
brings a new</i>

00:54.221 --> 00:56.422
<i>happy moment, a new challenge.</i>

00:56.424 --> 00:58.190
Look, Grace.

00:58.192 --> 01:01.026
- It's Africa.
- [Bindi] Do you see the rhinos out there?

01:01.028 --> 01:02.294
- Wow.
- They've spotted you.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.029
This could be the ultimate
<i>Lion King.</i>

01:04.031 --> 01:06.098
- I-It actually would.
- Actually could be pretty awesome.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.399
[Terri] Let's go to Pride Rock.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.635
I've never worried so much
in my life...

01:09.637 --> 01:11.670
Okay, there's a buggy coming.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.439
She's so sleepy.

01:13.441 --> 01:17.943
<i>[Bindi] ...because I want her to be
absolutely healthy and, and happy.</i>

01:17.945 --> 01:18.844
<i>A 100% of the time.</i>

01:18.846 --> 01:21.213
Who's that? Who's that?

01:21.815 --> 01:23.182
Ooh!

01:23.184 --> 01:24.917
Hello!

01:24.919 --> 01:27.586
- Hi.
<i>- [Bindi] But I am also happier than ever</i>

01:27.588 --> 01:31.156
just being with my family
and enjoying time together.

01:31.158 --> 01:34.526
- I'm trying to teach Bindi to be a Wildlife Warrior.
- Yeah.

01:34.528 --> 01:38.163
- And love all wildlife. Do you love all ants?
- Yep.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.965
- Are they your friends?
- Yep.

01:39.967 --> 01:44.369
<i>[Bindi] Dad definitely passed
on his passion for wildlife.</i>

01:44.371 --> 01:48.474
<i>And for me and Robert,
it means so much to us</i>

01:48.476 --> 01:51.577
<i>to be able to carry on
dad's legacy.</i>

01:51.579 --> 01:54.012
[Steve] You tell the camera
about the elk.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.815
How many is there?

01:59.419 --> 02:03.188
Wow, you're a good little
documentary cameraman, aren't you?

02:03.190 --> 02:08.160
And I hope to, someday, be
able to inspire Grace as well.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.696
<i>I have a feeling she's gonna
take on the world.</i>

02:10.698 --> 02:13.832
<i>She's gonna be our own
little hurricane. [laughs]</i>

02:16.035 --> 02:17.703
I love you.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.186
- Are you ready?
- [man] Yep.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.590
They're gonna be on. [grunts]

02:41.094 --> 02:44.062
- All right. Here we go.
- [alligator growls]

02:44.064 --> 02:47.166
<i>[Robert] Today, we're doing
one of the biggest jobs at the zoo.</i>

02:47.168 --> 02:49.268
Here you go. You get that one.
Good gators.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.969
<i>Feeding our massive alligators.</i>

02:50.971 --> 02:52.704
[man] Keep calling them out
that way.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.941
[chuckling] You can see
straightaway, there's a lot of gators here.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.712
Go for him, yep. Okay, I'm
gonna go for that fat one.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.251
We got 43 gators, and when
they're on, they're really on.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.153
- [man] Just back up.
- [Robert] You keep coming.

03:08.155 --> 03:12.558
<i>So, this is the last feed for these
gators because we're about to embark</i>

03:12.560 --> 03:16.795
on the biggest crocodilian
move in Australia Zoo history.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.564
The one on your right...
left.

03:20.466 --> 03:25.604
We're actually gonna be taking the
ten biggest alligators out of this lagoon,

03:25.606 --> 03:29.708
to another facility, about
a day's drive from here.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.476
Be nice.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.146
Here's a good gator.

03:34.213 --> 03:38.150
The reason why we're moving them is
just because of how big they're getting.

03:38.152 --> 03:41.086
And they're just starting
to outgrow this area in here.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.289
You got me cornered here, mate.

03:44.324 --> 03:48.227
It's just getting a little bit much.
There's so many in here vying for position,

03:48.229 --> 03:52.297
and it takes the whole entire
reptile team to feed these gators.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.132
And we do this once a week.

03:54.134 --> 03:57.569
<i>Unlike crocodiles, alligators,
they're a lot more social.</i>

03:57.571 --> 03:59.805
<i>So, when they move
to their new facility,</i>

03:59.807 --> 04:02.241
<i>they'll be able to adapt
to their new home</i>

04:02.243 --> 04:03.642
<i>with no stress.</i>

04:03.644 --> 04:07.045
<i>They'll live a really nice,
happy life with plenty of space.</i>

04:07.047 --> 04:11.250
<i>And then, at Australia Zoo, our
very crowded gator lagoon is gonna be</i>

04:11.252 --> 04:14.486
just that little bit safer
and easier for everyone.

04:16.489 --> 04:20.092
Now, alligators, once they get
to a big size,

04:20.094 --> 04:23.028
like this guy here,
Beau, the biggest of the lot.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.230
It is physically impossible

04:25.232 --> 04:28.333
to try and overpower these
guys. You're not gonna do it.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.935
[Steve] Let's get it!

04:29.937 --> 04:33.438
<i>[Robert] My mom and dad were
on a gator about 10 foot long,</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:37.542
<i>five people on this gator, and it
walked them back into the water.</i>

04:37.544 --> 04:40.879
He's dragging us back
into the gooey ooze.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.249
<i>[Robert] And we've got gators
that are so much bigger than that.</i>

04:44.251 --> 04:47.452
<i>There's just simply no way we're
gonna keep them in one spot.</i>

04:47.454 --> 04:49.655
Have a look at that high walk.
Isn't that incredible?

04:49.657 --> 04:53.258
Gators like Beau can get
themselves up off the ground

04:53.260 --> 04:54.926
because they're so strong.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.229
They've got those massive
big legs here,

04:57.231 --> 04:58.764
big, strong forearms,

04:58.766 --> 05:03.402
so, jumping on an alligator
is futile.

05:03.404 --> 05:07.105
<i>We're not gonna overpower them, we're
gonna have to get them out of the water</i>

05:07.107 --> 05:11.276
<i>lasso them, and try our best
with everyone's might,</i>

05:11.278 --> 05:12.611
to get them into the boxes.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.214
Ooh. Ooh, he's on.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.250
[laughs]

05:19.152 --> 05:21.553
How cool is that?
So, unlike crocs...

05:23.556 --> 05:27.292
these guys are a little bit more mild
mannered. I would not be doing this

05:27.294 --> 05:29.828
with a big salty.
No way at all.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.497
I would no longer have a hand.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.867
-Uh, but you're able to take a
little bit more liberty -[growls]

05:35.869 --> 05:37.669
with getting just a little bit
closer to them,

05:37.671 --> 05:41.006
'cause they have a fairly
sweet nature, actually.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.942
They're pretty nice. When
they're in this food mode--

05:45.211 --> 05:46.211
Got the bucket.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.848
See you, bucket.
Goodbye, bucket.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.484
Oh, I'm so sorry, mate.

05:52.486 --> 05:55.020
This just shows you why
you have to be so switched on.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.923
The minute they grab,
literally, anything,

05:57.925 --> 06:02.227
if that was your hand, they'll crush
it to about this big in an instant.

06:02.229 --> 06:07.432
And you can see how incredibly
protective, and, um...

06:07.434 --> 06:10.168
proud they get over
what they've caught.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.937
So, you don't want that
to be you.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.642
- No sudden movements.
- Nice, nice.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.078
When I do something stupid,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.714
the reptile team, luckily,
is very forgiving.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.384
And they'll never bring it up
again, I'll never get teased about it,

06:25.386 --> 06:28.053
and they'll, they'll never
talk about it, isn't that right?

06:28.055 --> 06:30.088
- It'll never come up. Never.
- Yeah, nah. You'll be all right.

06:30.090 --> 06:34.192
No, this is gonna be...
the rest of my life now.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.061
I'm never gonna hear
the end of that, am I?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.496
I'm never gonna hear
the end of that.

06:39.365 --> 06:42.567
That's just a little tiny
taste of what's to come.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.403
It's, it's just gonna be nuts.

06:46.372 --> 06:51.209
<i>Moving ten of the largest
alligators in about a weeks' time,</i>

06:51.211 --> 06:53.345
<i>it's gonna be a mammoth task.</i>

06:53.347 --> 06:55.947
And it's gonna take
everyone's effort.

06:55.949 --> 06:59.818
Oh, this has never been done
in the history of Australia Zoo.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.956
This is gonna be fun. This
is gonna be fun. [chuckles]

07:13.032 --> 07:15.467
So, the main thing we try and do when
we feed them, even though we're with them,

07:15.469 --> 07:17.302
- is just giving this much space.
- Sure.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.905
- I'm like that with dinner myself.
- [laughs]

07:19.907 --> 07:22.507
"Back off.
Back off the pizza."

07:24.076 --> 07:26.178
Today, I'm really lucky to get
to spend time

07:26.180 --> 07:29.548
with our four beautiful
Sumatran Elephants.

07:29.550 --> 07:33.084
<i>They've been here for almost
a year and a half now.</i>

07:33.719 --> 07:36.822
<i>They've settled in perfectly.</i>

07:36.824 --> 07:40.826
And it's time for them
to learn the next step.

07:40.828 --> 07:44.963
For years and years, Steve
wanted to help elephants in the wild.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.065
Aren't they just gorgeous?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.234
Absolutely beautiful.

07:50.837 --> 07:55.340
There's elephants all around. Snorkeling,
they're communicating with each other.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.676
I can't believe it.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.479
<i>[Terri] After spending time
in Sumatra,</i>

08:00.481 --> 08:05.116
<i>we discovered that the Sumatran
Elephants were so critically endangered.</i>

08:05.118 --> 08:08.353
<i>With less than 2500 left
in the wild,</i>

08:08.355 --> 08:11.556
<i>we knew our elephant ambassadors</i>

08:11.558 --> 08:14.359
had to be from this
beautiful place.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.963
[elephant trumpets]

08:18.698 --> 08:21.233
<i>[Terri] Our whole point
of sharing</i>

08:21.235 --> 08:25.270
<i>beautiful wildlife at Australia
Zoo is inspiring people</i>

08:25.272 --> 08:27.572
<i>to wanna protect them
in the wild.</i>

08:27.574 --> 08:32.377
<i>So, how do I encourage people to
wanna help our Sumatran Elephants?</i>

08:32.379 --> 08:33.778
Meet an elephant.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.048
So, our four beautiful
Sumatran Elephants

08:37.050 --> 08:40.986
<i>will be able to meet all of our
guests who come into Australia Zoo</i>

08:40.988 --> 08:43.088
<i>and they'll get to
watch the girls</i>

08:43.090 --> 08:46.558
<i>in a big, beautiful habitat area</i>

08:46.560 --> 08:50.128
<i>as they enjoy enrichment,
go swimming,</i>

08:50.130 --> 08:53.465
<i>wreck stuff, [laughing]
whatever they wanna do.</i>

08:53.467 --> 08:57.168
But to get them there,
means building a pathway.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.538
[indistinct]

08:59.540 --> 09:03.041
<i>Because it's more
than half a mile</i>

09:03.043 --> 09:07.145
<i>between their off-display
sanctuary area,</i>

09:07.147 --> 09:09.848
<i>and the place they're going
to meet our guests</i>

09:09.850 --> 09:12.083
<i>in their on-display habitat.</i>

09:12.085 --> 09:15.287
So, therefore, we are
building up walkway

09:15.289 --> 09:17.822
for ease of moving them
back and forth.

09:21.027 --> 09:24.963
<i>Not only is it going to be
good for them physically,</i>

09:24.965 --> 09:28.133
<i>to be able to walk through
this corridor everyday,</i>

09:28.135 --> 09:31.536
<i>but it's also gonna be
so awesome psychologically,</i>

09:31.538 --> 09:35.574
<i>because with all the different
people, the different stimulation</i>

09:35.576 --> 09:36.942
<i>that they're gonna get,</i>

09:36.944 --> 09:40.211
<i>it's just the best possible
life for an elephant.</i>

09:40.213 --> 09:43.815
<i>I don't know anywhere else
in a zoological facility,</i>

09:43.817 --> 09:48.420
where the elephants get to walk miles
every single day. It's pretty special.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.025
<i>The biggest challenge is</i>

09:54.027 --> 09:57.996
<i>making sure that they know that
this corridor is a safe space for them.</i>

09:58.998 --> 10:03.001
<i>Surprisingly, the world's
largest land animal</i>

10:03.003 --> 10:07.472
is also one of the most
nervous of little things.

10:07.474 --> 10:11.409
<i>And because the corridor
is out in nature,</i>

10:11.411 --> 10:13.812
they're particularly
nervous of birds.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.815
So, anything like
scrub turkeys, kookaburras,

10:16.817 --> 10:21.286
<i>anything flying in suddenly
might make them feel nervous.</i>

10:21.288 --> 10:26.024
<i>If they have a bad experience, it
could set everything back a long time.</i>

10:26.026 --> 10:28.860
So, what Steve and the team
are gonna do

10:28.862 --> 10:31.696
is start introducing them
to the walkway

10:31.698 --> 10:33.064
as it's being built.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.802
<i>The wildcard is gonna
be Raflesia.</i>

10:37.804 --> 10:41.306
<i>All of the older girls
are very protective of her,</i>

10:41.308 --> 10:45.243
<i>so I really need her to be
cool, calm and collected.</i>

10:45.245 --> 10:48.813
<i>If she spooks,
everyone will follow suit.</i>

10:57.089 --> 10:59.824
It's baby season here
at Australia Zoo.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.726
But not just for me.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.996
- [Kirsten] We have a joey.
- [gasps] Oh my gosh.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.433
Oh, my word. Look at that,
you can totally see.

11:08.435 --> 11:12.037
- [gasps] Oh, my gosh, Ruby, you're a mama.
- Wow.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.738
[Bindi] Holy cow!

11:13.740 --> 11:17.175
<i>Our gorgeous Koalas are all
having joeys at the moment.</i>

11:17.177 --> 11:18.910
- You could swap stories.
- Yeah, it's true.

11:18.912 --> 11:22.681
My birth was a lot more
difficult than yours.

11:22.683 --> 11:26.251
- [Kirsten] This is joey number 10.
- Congratulations, sweetheart.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.723
Every koala breeding season
here at the zoo is important.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.992
<i>Each year we manage
to breed around 10.</i>

11:33.994 --> 11:36.594
<i>And it's been so successful
over the years.</i>

11:37.697 --> 11:39.431
[Bindi] Hi, love.
How are you doing?

11:39.433 --> 11:41.900
You are so beautiful.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.636
<i>[Kirsten] Cedar's one of our
older koalas here at the zoo.</i>

11:44.638 --> 11:46.237
<i>She's nearly 13 years old.</i>

11:46.239 --> 11:49.541
<i>She was rescued from the wild
because she'd been attacked by a dog.</i>

11:49.543 --> 11:50.942
So, she came over here
to the zoo

11:50.944 --> 11:53.611
where she's been living
quite happily ever since.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.781
- [Bindi] Shall we have a little pouch check?
- Yeah, let's do it.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.917
- All right. Let's do it. No worries.
- Exciting.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.620
<i>[Kirsten] Two seasons ago, she was
fortunate enough to give birth to twins,</i>

12:02.622 --> 12:05.023
<i>which is extremely rare.</i>

12:05.025 --> 12:07.926
[Bindi] Twins, a set a twins
in one season.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.495
- Good girl. You did so good.
- You did so good.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.164
And one of them,
is of course, Bert,

12:13.166 --> 12:16.000
<i>who is doing so well
in our population here.</i>

12:16.535 --> 12:17.569
Good job.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.040
She hasn't had a joey
this season.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.642
- Oh, we've checked her pouch. But she wasn't successful.
- Yeah.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.345
- [Bindi] Maybe next time. There's always next year.
- Yep.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.680
[Bindi] We're so proud of you.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.349
- It's so important that we continue to do this...
- [Kirsten] Yeah.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.552
And for the species as well.
I mean, you look at everything

12:34.554 --> 12:36.287
that koalas have gone through.

12:36.289 --> 12:40.125
Their species is hanging
on the edge.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.194
So, it's up to us
to be able to do our part

12:43.196 --> 12:45.764
in ensuring their future
on the planet.

12:45.766 --> 12:49.200
The fact that we're able to have
such a stable breeding program,

12:49.202 --> 12:52.137
- thanks to you and your amazing guidance...
- [laughs]

12:52.139 --> 12:54.139
it's, um, it's really,
really special.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.310
For the first six months
of a koala joey's life,

12:59.312 --> 13:02.981
<i>they are pretty much
just in mama's pouch.</i>

13:02.983 --> 13:06.017
Hi, guys! How's it going?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.952
Everyone's looking very relaxed.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.489
<i>So, our team is
constantly monitoring</i>

13:11.491 --> 13:15.727
to make sure that both koala mum
and joey are putting on enough weight.

13:15.729 --> 13:18.696
The mums in here are a
lot further along. They're...

13:18.698 --> 13:21.132
around five to six months.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.536
<i>[Bindi] In about a month,
the koala joeys in this habitat</i>

13:24.538 --> 13:26.938
<i>that are currently five
months old,</i>

13:26.940 --> 13:29.808
<i>will be exploring outside
their mum's pouch.</i>

13:29.810 --> 13:32.377
<i>But we need to make sure
they've developed enough,</i>

13:32.379 --> 13:36.481
to be able to handle the colder
temperatures of the winter months.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.050
There's a couple in particular
that we're watching quite closely.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.853
- Sure.
- Uh, Stella being one of them.

13:41.855 --> 13:45.256
- Her weight hasn't increased at the rate we would expect.
- [Bindi] Okay.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.025
[Kirsten] Fit to be carrying
a young.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.228
<i>Over the last few weeks,
Stella's weight hasn't moved.</i>

13:50.230 --> 13:53.598
And it, it should be. She's carrying
a joey and that joey is developing.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.133
Is it her weight?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.502
Is it the joey's weight?
Is she...

13:57.504 --> 14:00.405
feeding the joey well? Are they
both progressing well together?

14:00.407 --> 14:02.106
There you go.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.909
- I wonder if she'll let me...
- Have a look?

14:04.911 --> 14:06.945
[Kirsten] Oh, there's a--
A foot.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.814
- [Bindi] Yeah.
- It's definitely moving around in there.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.583
- Oh, there's a hand.
- [Bindi] Mm-hmm.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.351
So, it's, it's
definitely caught.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.387
Quite active in there
and moving around.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.290
But it doesn't look like
it has developed. So...

14:22.027 --> 14:25.864
Right now, I'm not convinced
that the joey's thriving in there.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.599
[Bindi] It's a worry.

14:27.601 --> 14:31.202
I think if there's no further
increase over the next few days,

14:31.204 --> 14:33.805
then I probably recommend
to step in

14:33.807 --> 14:36.074
and take over the feeding
of the joey.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.042
Regardless of size,

14:38.044 --> 14:41.045
uh, I feel that should be,
have more fur on it.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.948
I think if it did come out of the
pouch in the condition that it's in,

14:43.950 --> 14:46.150
it could cause the joey
a fair bit of stress.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.152
Not to mention physical trauma.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.487
Good work.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.155
You did so good, love.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.091
We're gonna see how
things progress.

14:53.093 --> 14:57.996
<i>Ideally, this little joey will come
out of mum's pouch unassisted,</i>

14:57.998 --> 15:00.398
<i>but if this joey
is underdeveloped,</i>

15:00.400 --> 15:02.333
we will need to intervene.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.281
[Robert] Good day,
everyone. Um...

15:16.283 --> 15:18.750
Today's gonna be
pretty exciting. It's gonna be

15:18.752 --> 15:22.320
the first time that we've done
anything to this scale with gators.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.924
<i>Today we're embarking on
one of the largest animal moves</i>

15:25.926 --> 15:27.992
in the history of Australia Zoo.

15:29.828 --> 15:33.564
<i>Moving ten gators
from a massive gator lake</i>

15:33.566 --> 15:36.167
out to another facility.

15:36.169 --> 15:40.038
<i>We've assembled the entire
reptile crew, because it's vital</i>

15:40.040 --> 15:42.373
<i>that we keep the upper hand
with these gators.</i>

15:42.375 --> 15:44.475
<i>And that we're ready
for anything.</i>

15:44.477 --> 15:46.311
What we'll probably do,

15:46.313 --> 15:48.546
we're gonna go one at a time
with the gators.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.848
<i>The choice of gators
that we capture</i>

15:50.850 --> 15:53.751
<i>is gonna be a first come,
first serve situation.</i>

15:53.753 --> 15:56.220
<i>We'll try our best to be
selective, but just have to assess</i>

15:56.222 --> 15:58.690
how the gators go
in that first wave.

15:58.692 --> 16:02.226
Because as soon as the
first one gets a rope on it,

16:02.228 --> 16:04.095
<i>they are gonna be on board.</i>

16:04.097 --> 16:05.596
<i>They'll know what's happening.</i>

16:05.598 --> 16:08.633
And they are not gonna be
happy with being caught.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.501
<i>So, time will be of the essence.</i>

16:10.503 --> 16:13.237
<i>Because the truck needs
to leave by midday,</i>

16:13.239 --> 16:16.007
<i>to make it to the other
facility in reasonable time.</i>

16:16.009 --> 16:19.510
And then, it's just gonna be
really crucial on communication,

16:19.512 --> 16:24.482
because safety is the
priority, for them and for us.

16:24.484 --> 16:28.186
They're alligators, they're
not crocs, but treat it

16:28.188 --> 16:30.321
just exactly the same.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.223
We all happy? Let's do this.

16:36.295 --> 16:40.398
My concern is that
first wave when we get in

16:40.400 --> 16:42.467
- because-- - All bloody
40 of them will come over.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.102
We're just gonna have
to roll with the punches

16:44.104 --> 16:45.937
- and just see what happens and...
- Yep.

16:45.939 --> 16:50.408
<i>[Robert] As soon as they see us, they
see buckets, they see the khaki uniforms,</i>

16:50.410 --> 16:54.479
<i>we're gonna have about 40
gators, this massive tsunami,</i>

16:54.481 --> 16:56.614
this wall of gators, that are
all gonna be chasing us down.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.917
Truck's in.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.286
<i>I'm feeling incredibly excited,</i>

17:02.288 --> 17:06.424
<i>nervous, it's just, it's a huge
pump of adrenaline at this point.</i>

17:06.426 --> 17:10.294
<i>Because we're working with one of the
most unpredictable animals in the world.</i>

17:10.296 --> 17:12.964
<i>And in an incredibly
dangerous situation.</i>

17:13.832 --> 17:15.533
Watch your backs as well.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.735
It's gonna be mayhem.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.205
Hello, gators.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.042
<i>I'm watching these gators,</i>

17:24.044 --> 17:26.310
and they've just gone aground.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.479
They're not even coming out
of the water.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.448
Come on, boys.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.683
They're a little bit smarter
than we thought. [laughs]

17:32.685 --> 17:35.153
Come on, gators.
Come on, guys.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.655
<i>They're an incredibly
intelligent animal.</i>

17:37.657 --> 17:40.992
<i>Somehow they know that
we're in here to catch them.</i>

17:40.994 --> 17:43.394
<i>They've seen the ropes
in our hands,</i>

17:43.396 --> 17:46.230
<i>they've seen everyone,
they've seen the truck,</i>

17:46.232 --> 17:48.866
and they don't want
a part of it.

17:51.670 --> 17:55.239
<i>And so, it's gonna be
a lot more difficult.</i>

17:55.241 --> 17:56.774
Come on, guys! Come on.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.645
This is the biggest
spanner in the works,

18:00.647 --> 18:03.181
<i>that no one saw coming.</i>

18:16.495 --> 18:19.831
<i>[Kirsten] Just had a call from
one of my staff who've reported that</i>

18:19.833 --> 18:21.766
<i>Stella's joey has
finally come out.</i>

18:22.301 --> 18:24.268
So, finally.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.370
Well spotted, team.

18:26.372 --> 18:29.507
We finally got Stella's
joey out of the pouch,

18:29.509 --> 18:31.409
and look at the size of it.

18:31.411 --> 18:35.012
We've, um, determined
that it is a boy.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.614
So, that's pretty cool.

18:36.616 --> 18:41.152
The, the conditions inside the
pouch are so unique, are so dark,

18:41.154 --> 18:44.222
uh, they-- they're warm, so this
is probably bit of a... [chuckles]

18:44.224 --> 18:47.458
A rude awakening
for the little guy, so...

18:47.460 --> 18:49.127
The quicker we get this
weight on him,

18:49.129 --> 18:50.962
the quicker he can dive back
to where he feels

18:50.964 --> 18:52.230
a bit more comfortable.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.599
And, um, we'll be able to see

18:54.601 --> 18:57.168
if he's hydrated.
I can already see

18:57.170 --> 19:00.371
some of the skin's
a little bit wrinkly.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.974
This is an opportunity
to get an individual weight

19:02.976 --> 19:04.575
<i>of mum and joey.</i>

19:04.577 --> 19:08.112
This will give us a really good indication
of whether the joey is developing.

19:08.114 --> 19:11.616
He just... [chuckles] dimension
wise, he looks really small.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.751
So, together...

19:14.686 --> 19:16.387
6.28.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.991
Physically, I feel like he doesn't
have a lot of muscle development,

19:19.993 --> 19:21.859
even in his forearms there.

19:21.861 --> 19:25.530
So, until I get a weight
separate on mum...

19:25.532 --> 19:27.665
I know it's rude, isn't it?

19:30.269 --> 19:32.370
6.12.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.739
So, the next step is to do
some maths in my head,

19:34.741 --> 19:36.641
which I'm not that great at.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.776
Ruby, 160.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.846
160? [scoffs]

19:42.381 --> 19:43.447
That's small.

19:43.982 --> 19:45.449
That is very small.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.152
<i>Stella's joey is five
and a half ounces.</i>

19:48.154 --> 19:51.355
The average should be
around ten.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.525
Zoo vet, copy, zoo vet?

19:57.930 --> 19:59.096
[beep]

19:59.164 --> 20:03.067
Hi, Sam, I've just got
Stella's joey out of the pouch.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.204
It's tiny.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.407
<i>If Stella's joey's not putting
on weight, it could mean</i>

20:09.409 --> 20:11.309
<i>Stella's not producing
enough milk,</i>

20:11.311 --> 20:15.346
<i>and we might have to step in and
take over the feeding of the joey.</i>

20:15.348 --> 20:18.149
That's going to involve
removing the joey from mum,

20:18.151 --> 20:20.318
that's always the last resort.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.687
-[koala squeaks] -It's
all right. He's just here.

20:25.657 --> 20:30.561
So, there's the tiny, tiny little
squeaks coming from, from the joey.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.297
Mum can hear it. She's
just checking if he's okay.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.099
She comes in.

20:36.201 --> 20:37.535
He's finally come out.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.538
I haven't had one
this small before.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.206
Uh, I'm not worried about
the size actually,

20:42.208 --> 20:43.908
I think his condition's not
too bad really.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.209
It's the right body condition.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.044
He's just a really small joey.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.113
But otherwise,
he's nice and active.

20:49.115 --> 20:52.883
His condition's quite good and he's got--
He's definitely got food in his belly.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.685
<i>So, just a tiny bit dehydrated.</i>

20:54.687 --> 20:58.222
<i>We'll just give him some fluids to
get him through the next 24 hours.</i>

20:59.091 --> 21:01.425
Good, bubby. You're being
very brave.

21:03.362 --> 21:06.097
<i>[Kirsten] This is the best
outcome for Stella and the joey.</i>

21:06.099 --> 21:08.432
The joey can go straight back
to its mum.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.435
[joey squeaking]

21:11.937 --> 21:13.304
We're in.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.806
<i>It can stay with mum,
it's feeding from mum.</i>

21:15.808 --> 21:17.608
Perfect, thank you.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.412
<i>I'll take Stella up
to the headquarters,</i>

21:21.414 --> 21:23.848
because the weather's really
cooling down at night now,

21:23.850 --> 21:26.150
so if the joey does come
out again,

21:26.152 --> 21:29.353
perhaps he doesn't have great
deal of strength, if he has a fall,

21:29.355 --> 21:32.523
or very long, cold night
for him, uh, which...

21:32.525 --> 21:34.825
could prove a very nasty
ending for him.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.129
We will go here.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.064
<i>Stella's joey's still not
out of the woods.</i>

21:40.066 --> 21:42.667
We'll be monitoring this one
really, really closely,

21:42.669 --> 21:45.803
and hoping that we can see
some very small increases

21:45.805 --> 21:47.838
in weight over the coming weeks.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.808
Good night, little joey.
Feed well.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.450
[Robert] Come on, guys.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.385
- If one comes over...
- [man] Yeah.

22:01.387 --> 22:05.122
Between the two of us, we'll just
take som-- take every chance we get.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.591
<i>We've been here half an hour,
and it's already going</i>

22:07.593 --> 22:09.093
<i>very different
to what we'd planned.</i>

22:09.095 --> 22:11.962
We thought they'd be a
little wary, this is next level.

22:11.964 --> 22:15.132
I mean, they don't want
a part of this.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.734
Come on, guys. Come on.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.803
<i>What we're gonna have
to do is be opportunistic.</i>

22:18.805 --> 22:20.338
<i>We just gotta go for
who we can get.</i>

22:20.340 --> 22:22.440
Come on, gators.
Come on, guys!

22:29.181 --> 22:30.948
All right, we got a rope
on the first one.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.284
<i>This is great.
They're so tough.</i>

22:33.286 --> 22:36.020
<i>You can tug on it as hard
as you want,</i>

22:36.022 --> 22:38.089
<i>and they'll barely feel a thing.</i>

22:38.091 --> 22:39.857
- Small box.
- [grunts]

22:41.193 --> 22:43.594
<i>[Robert] So now, we'll take
a microchip number,</i>

22:43.596 --> 22:45.363
so we know exactly who it is.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.230
It's Flavor Flav.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.167
Let's go. Box to him, there.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.536
And pull!

22:56.408 --> 22:58.209
- You happy, Tobs?
- Yeah, man.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.745
[alligator growling]

23:00.747 --> 23:04.382
[Robert] One down, nine to go. That
was nice, smaller one to start off with.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.450
Uh, and next, got some big ones.

23:08.487 --> 23:09.687
Hey, good boy.

23:15.093 --> 23:16.761
- It will walk up, mate. It will walk up.
- Awesome.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.596
- Elwood.
- Elwood.

23:18.598 --> 23:19.964
Okay, pull.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.636
Love it.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.806
[Robert chuckles] <i>Two down of the
ten, we've got Flavor Flav and Elwood.</i>

23:29.441 --> 23:30.775
[indistinct]

23:33.912 --> 23:35.513
- Herbie.
- [man] That's it.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.214
And he's fully loaded.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.851
Starting to really get
into a good groove.

23:40.853 --> 23:44.021
The next step, I think we're
going to try get one of the big boys.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.727
- [growling]
- [splashing]

23:51.496 --> 23:53.364
[indistinct]

23:53.366 --> 23:55.466
- What size, Tobs?
- [Toby] One, two, three, pull!

23:55.468 --> 23:57.334
Big, definitely, big box.

23:57.336 --> 24:01.405
- [woman] They're all starting to look huge.
- [alligator growls]

24:01.407 --> 24:03.941
- Oh, that's a big one.
- [man] We're gonna need more people, right?

24:04.810 --> 24:06.844
<i>[Robert] The gators are
so strong.</i>

24:07.579 --> 24:08.879
Gotta tie it off.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.817
Just the amount of force that
they have, the amount of power.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.519
<i>They just set themselves,
dig their heels in.</i>

24:17.289 --> 24:20.591
<i>We've gotta tap into some
big power reserves here.</i>

24:20.593 --> 24:23.060
Holy man. Holy man.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.595
This is the one
we've been waitin' for.

24:25.430 --> 24:27.865
- Who is it?
- Beau. Beau.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.266
Big, bad Beau.

24:29.268 --> 24:32.069
- [Beau growls]
- He is a big boy.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.205
And he knows
he's really powerful.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.940
Okay, pull!

24:39.211 --> 24:41.445
Okay. Well, he's a monster.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.614
- [panting] That is a massive gator.
- [drill whirring]

24:44.316 --> 24:47.051
Good workout, mate. All right.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.386
Come on big boy.
Come on, gators. Come on.

24:49.388 --> 24:51.088
Paunch, Donkey.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.656
Come on, gators.

24:52.658 --> 24:57.094
<i>We've passed halfway, which is
great. It's all gone fairly smoothly.</i>

24:57.096 --> 24:58.996
Come on, big boy.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.465
- Got a hook on?
- [man] No, he just bit the rope.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.333
[Robert] Okay.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.635
<i>But now, it's getting hard.</i>

25:04.637 --> 25:07.171
<i>All of these gators know
what's going on.</i>

25:07.173 --> 25:09.940
The jig's up. They've seen
all their friends getting caught,

25:09.942 --> 25:12.843
and they don't want anything
to do with us.

25:12.845 --> 25:13.644
Come on, then.

25:14.579 --> 25:16.847
There we-- come on, come on.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.117
<i>[Terri] It's getting warmer, the
sun's starting to come out a bit,</i>

25:20.119 --> 25:23.287
<i>and at some point, we're
gonna have to hit the road.</i>

25:23.289 --> 25:26.524
Because they're reptiles,
alligators can't thermoregulate.

25:26.526 --> 25:30.494
<i>So, we're battling keeping
them cool, we're battling, uh,</i>

25:30.496 --> 25:33.631
<i>timeline for when the truck
has to leave.</i>

25:33.633 --> 25:36.033
So, it's getting a little dicey.

25:46.344 --> 25:51.248
Our koala breeding program has
been extremely successful this season.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.485
<i>Everyday I'm in awe
of our amazing mothers.</i>

25:57.322 --> 26:01.725
<i>However, koalas are susceptible
to all kinds of problems.</i>

26:01.727 --> 26:04.628
<i>Sometimes, they'll be looking
fine and healthy,</i>

26:04.630 --> 26:06.964
and then the next minute,
things go downhill.

26:10.835 --> 26:13.404
Hey, guys. I just got the call
about Cedar.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.372
I'll be there as fast as I can.

26:16.975 --> 26:20.044
<i>Cedar, one of our older
breeding, female koalas,</i>

26:20.046 --> 26:22.313
<i>has been rushed
to the wildlife hospital</i>

26:22.315 --> 26:24.148
<i>needing emergency care.</i>

26:33.091 --> 26:34.692
[beeping]

26:34.694 --> 26:38.829
Let's go with
the 2.5% glucose.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.131
<i>[Kirsten] This afternoon,
we went in to check Cedar.</i>

26:41.133 --> 26:43.434
<i>We found her weight
had dropped considerably.</i>

26:43.436 --> 26:47.938
Around half kilogram, so 500
grams she's dropped in two weeks.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.840
Which is... huge.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.712
She was eating this morning,
definitely.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.982
I had lunch. And by the time
I come back, she was...

26:57.984 --> 27:00.517
- [Sam] Yep.
- Dangling. Trying to hold herself up.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.486
That's happened in the space
of an hour.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.254
Is she breathing on her own,
or are you...

27:09.227 --> 27:12.262
- Hey, guys. How's it going?
- Hi, Bindi.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.598
- [Sam] Not so good.
- Not, uh...

27:14.600 --> 27:17.101
Not so great for Cedar
at the minute, no.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.336
Let me show you her mouth.

27:19.338 --> 27:22.039
So, these teeth have worn
right down to gum level.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.674
This tooth's about to come out.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.275
- Oh, that's loose.
- Um...

27:26.211 --> 27:29.079
She's got quite significant
gum recession.

27:29.081 --> 27:32.216
<i>[Sam] Cedar's mouth
is looking in quite bad shape.</i>

27:32.218 --> 27:34.485
<i>She's got quite extensive
tooth wear,</i>

27:34.487 --> 27:38.355
<i>but this is actually normal for her age
and we'd been monitoring this very closely.</i>

27:38.357 --> 27:42.092
And it certainly had not been
causing her any problems until recently.

27:42.094 --> 27:45.162
On her soft palate here,
ooh, she's got

27:45.164 --> 27:48.899
quite significant swelling,
inflammation and an ulcer.

27:48.901 --> 27:52.670
<i>It appears that very recently
she's had some gum recession.</i>

27:52.672 --> 27:56.140
<i>And this has allowed bacteria
to seed under her gums,</i>

27:56.142 --> 28:00.511
and affect her tooth roots. And then
potentially seed into her bloodstream.

28:00.513 --> 28:03.247
- So, not necessarily a pressure or contact...
- [Sam] No, no...

28:03.249 --> 28:05.049
- It's more systemic. Right.
- [Sam] Yeah.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.584
<i>[Sam] So, bacteria getting
into the bloodstream,</i>

28:07.586 --> 28:10.954
<i>particularly for koalas who have
quite a compromised immune system</i>

28:10.956 --> 28:12.356
<i>as a species already,</i>

28:12.358 --> 28:15.359
can be fatal, and it can
be quite rapidly fatal.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.729
- Oh my goodness me.
- She's got some ulcers along,

28:18.731 --> 28:21.632
- on her tongue there. Yeah.
- [Bindi] Oh, Sam. That's horrible.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.508
<i>[Kirsten] I'm just shocked,
actually at the moment.</i>

28:32.243 --> 28:33.777
Just didn't see this one coming.

28:37.115 --> 28:40.417
I don't think we can deal
with her oral pathology

28:40.419 --> 28:42.386
well enough to make
her comfortable.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.823
And like you said, Kirsten,
she is losing dramatic weight.

28:47.692 --> 28:50.094
Which she won't put back on
if she can't eat.

28:50.595 --> 28:51.995
[beeping]

28:52.097 --> 28:54.331
- You mean, she's in pain.
- We need to make that decision for her now.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.433
I just don't think it's fair
to wake her up and...

28:56.435 --> 28:57.835
I just don't agree.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.570
- Yeah.
- No.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.773
- All right.
- We love you so much, sweetheart.

29:05.210 --> 29:09.446
<i>Dr. Sam's just made the
recommendation to euthanize Cedar.</i>

29:09.448 --> 29:12.349
She's clearly...
in a very poor way.

29:12.351 --> 29:16.420
Best thing for her is
gonna be to... to let her go.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.088
Yep, okay.

29:20.024 --> 29:23.293
<i>It's the hardest decision, it's
the best decision for Cedar.</i>

29:23.295 --> 29:25.095
<i>We know deep down.</i>

29:25.097 --> 29:27.231
<i>But just the hardest decision
to make.</i>

29:40.678 --> 29:44.448
- I'm so sorry, love.
- [sniffles]

29:45.250 --> 29:46.650
Oh, Cedar.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.586
[Kirsten sniffling] Yep.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.459
I'm so thankful
she's not in pain anymore.

29:57.428 --> 29:59.329
I'm so sorry, love.

29:59.331 --> 30:02.232
Yeah... [sighs wearily]
Okay.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.101
[Bindi] I'm so sorry, Kirsten.

30:05.036 --> 30:06.703
Oh, my gosh.

30:08.406 --> 30:10.574
[sobbing]

30:10.576 --> 30:13.410
How the hell did that
just happen?

30:13.412 --> 30:16.880
<i>I've known Cedar since
I came to the zoo.</i>

30:16.882 --> 30:20.150
<i>We've certainly watched her go through
a lot and she had a real personality.</i>

30:22.020 --> 30:23.821
She was special
to a lot of the keepers.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.991
Like, it's so important
to focus on the good. But...

30:32.463 --> 30:34.364
Yep, it's so good.

30:34.899 --> 30:36.200
Yeah.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.402
I'm gonna go hug my daughter.

30:38.404 --> 30:41.104
And um... Yeah.
Thanks for the call.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.675
Ah, I'm so sorry.

30:46.377 --> 30:48.612
Yeah, it's so true.

30:52.350 --> 30:56.086
<i>[Kirsten] Koalas like Cedar,
who's... come from the wild,</i>

30:56.088 --> 30:58.388
<i>they're so important
to breeding programs.</i>

30:58.390 --> 31:02.659
<i>And fortunately, Cedar's had
the opportunity to contribute to that.</i>

31:02.661 --> 31:05.095
<i>Out in the wild,
she wouldn't have that.</i>

31:05.097 --> 31:07.931
<i>She was attacked
by a dog. So...</i>

31:07.933 --> 31:12.102
<i>giving her that opportunity,
having those genetics represented</i>

31:12.104 --> 31:14.538
in captivity for years to come,

31:14.540 --> 31:16.740
that's, that's Cedar's legacy.

31:26.684 --> 31:28.685
[Robert] Holy. Look at
the size of that.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.654
- [man] That's Larry.
- That's Larry for sure.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.826
- Three more to go.
- Yeah. Pull him up.

31:35.828 --> 31:41.465
We're in the midst of the biggest
alligator move ever at Australia Zoo.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.033
Yeah, that other one.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.269
- [man] Jam Master Jay.
- [Robert] Jam Master Jay!

31:45.271 --> 31:46.904
Jeez, we've got some
good names in here.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.138
Okay, pull.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.174
<i>We've now caught eight
of the ten big gators.</i>

31:52.443 --> 31:54.845
- How good.
- Woo hoo!

31:54.847 --> 31:59.049
It's hot. It's physically and it's
mentally just... an exhausting process.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.451
Because you think about it,
every gator that we get,

32:01.453 --> 32:04.488
it's 100%, it's got
all of its energy.

32:04.490 --> 32:07.557
So it's hard yakka.
Hard yakka.

32:08.526 --> 32:09.626
Come on, guys.

32:10.828 --> 32:12.396
[groans]

32:12.398 --> 32:15.933
<i>We're continuously changing our
plans to kind of stay one step ahead</i>

32:15.935 --> 32:18.168
<i>of these very, very
cunning gators.</i>

32:19.637 --> 32:22.439
No. No.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.308
They just bit the rope off.

32:24.310 --> 32:29.046
But these last two are proving
extremely difficult.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.081
Cheeky bloody gator.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.516
Cheeky little gators.

32:33.318 --> 32:35.018
<i>Time is catching up to us.</i>

32:35.020 --> 32:37.120
<i>We've got eight gators
on the truck,</i>

32:37.122 --> 32:39.489
<i>and we really need
to hit the road.</i>

32:39.491 --> 32:42.592
Wonder whether it's worse just going
around to that Cypress pine corner.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.995
Go for it, mate.

32:44.997 --> 32:47.197
<i>[Robert] We're gonna
divide and conquer.</i>

32:47.199 --> 32:51.268
<i>Hopefully, if we all spread
ourselves out a little more,</i>

32:51.270 --> 32:53.236
<i>we'll be able to have
better luck.</i>

32:53.938 --> 32:55.539
Come on, guys. Come on.

32:55.541 --> 32:56.707
Come on.

32:56.709 --> 33:00.110
<i>However, if one of us gets
a good rope</i>

33:00.112 --> 33:03.046
<i>on a big gator still
in the water,</i>

33:03.048 --> 33:06.049
<i>and we can't get to that
other person in time,</i>

33:06.051 --> 33:07.384
<i>there's a chance</i>

33:07.386 --> 33:09.653
<i>they're gonna end up in
the drink with the gator.</i>

33:09.655 --> 33:11.989
Which is not fun. [chuckles]

33:12.690 --> 33:15.058
[loud splashing]

33:15.060 --> 33:16.493
- [Robert] Is he on?
- [man] Yeah.

33:18.463 --> 33:21.932
<i>[Robert] It is all stations go.</i>

33:21.934 --> 33:26.136
<i>Because this gator is already
pulling the boys back into the water.</i>

33:27.105 --> 33:29.172
- You guys good?
- Yeah, we're good.

33:30.408 --> 33:31.341
Okay, pull.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.111
Hold.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.279
So this is Mo in the box now.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.181
Number nine, second to last.

33:38.183 --> 33:41.051
- One more gator to go.
- [drilling]

33:41.053 --> 33:43.186
The last one's definitely
gonna be the most challenging,

33:43.188 --> 33:45.989
'cause he's watched all of his
buddies getting caught.

33:45.991 --> 33:48.158
So, they're gonna know
the jig is up.

33:48.493 --> 33:50.193
Come on.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.561
Come on, gators, come on.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.497
Come on, gator.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.666
They won't say it, but it's
getting a little bit competitive now.

33:56.668 --> 34:00.303
[laughs] Oh... It's
We're all working together.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.172
Come on, boys. Come on.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.608
Who will catch
the last one? Who...

34:04.610 --> 34:06.543
will be the alligator hero?

34:06.545 --> 34:09.579
Nah, whoever gets it is all
good. Just as long as it's not Nick.

34:10.281 --> 34:11.348
Or Toby.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.855
- Get away.
- Woo-hoo!

34:19.957 --> 34:23.226
Toby, Dalai Lama of gators,
has done it.

34:23.228 --> 34:27.164
- Nugget! Nugget. Walk up.
- [Toby] Oh, good size.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.832
[Robert] Yep. Okay, pull.

34:31.669 --> 34:33.537
[all laugh]

34:33.539 --> 34:35.505
- Woo!
- Yes.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.841
As they say, ten out of ten.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.243
[Robert] Aw, yeah.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.711
Last one in.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.547
- Good work.
- [Toby] Nice job.

34:43.549 --> 34:48.552
Guys, guys, guys. Congratulations.
That is such a good job.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.321
- I think nothing but a hug will do.
- Oh, mate.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.390
That's just sweat and blood.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.825
- Of joy.
- And tears.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.627
- Oh.
- Mm...

34:57.629 --> 35:00.464
- [Robert] That's pretty gross.
- [man] Even the pocket imprint.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.965
[Robert] Oh, that's disgusting.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.834
And now we're doing fist bumps.

35:03.836 --> 35:06.403
Good job, everyone. Thank you.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.574
[Robert] Now we got a big trip.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.376
- Gee, getting them out is gonna be fun.
- Yep.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.946
It's gonna be all you, buddy.

35:15.948 --> 35:19.850
<i>[Robert] The truck's completely
sealed, secured, and air conditioned.</i>

35:19.852 --> 35:22.385
<i>So they'll be in perfect
comfort for the whole trip.</i>

35:23.321 --> 35:24.588
See you, boys!

35:25.456 --> 35:27.090
<i>We're only halfway there.</i>

35:27.092 --> 35:30.093
<i>Nick and I still have to head
all the way down south,</i>

35:30.095 --> 35:33.363
and meet these gators
at their awesome new home.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.933
<i>And then, big mission of
actually releasing these gators.</i>

35:36.935 --> 35:40.537
Now, the release is easily
just as dangerous

35:40.539 --> 35:43.073
and just as difficult
as the catch.

35:54.685 --> 35:56.353
[Terri] Touch. Touch.

35:57.388 --> 35:59.289
Touch.

35:59.291 --> 36:04.294
<i>Our construction team had completed
the first path of an elephant walkway</i>

36:04.296 --> 36:07.931
to go from their off-display
sanctuary,

36:07.933 --> 36:11.101
to their habitat for guests
to get to see them.

36:12.503 --> 36:16.907
So, now is the time,
as we stage the build,

36:16.909 --> 36:22.345
to introduce the elephants to
their corridor for the first time.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.248
So, today we're gonna be walking
maybe 30-40 meters southward.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.716
- And let them relax.
- [Terri] Yeah...

36:26.718 --> 36:29.986
If they wanna come back, they
come back. It's also their choice as well.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.556
Do you mind taking those?
Don't wanna hurt your knees.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.225
- And we will come down this way.
- Cool.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.794
<i>The main thing is that they know</i>

36:37.796 --> 36:40.730
<i>this corridor is a safe space
for them.</i>

36:40.732 --> 36:45.135
<i>It's making sure there's some of
their favorite snacks along the way.</i>

36:45.202 --> 36:47.337
This does look delicious.

36:47.339 --> 36:49.673
[Steve] It's, it's one of their
favorite things in the world.

36:49.675 --> 36:52.709
So, what we're trying to do, we're
trying to make this appealing to

36:52.711 --> 36:54.244
- Raflesia, our youngest one.
- Right.

36:54.246 --> 36:57.514
[Steve] Because even though
we have a matriarch, Raf,

36:57.516 --> 36:59.983
if she gets worked up
and wants to run around,

36:59.985 --> 37:02.285
everyone else follows her.
So if we keep her calm,

37:02.287 --> 37:05.121
- we keep the group calm.
- Great.

37:05.123 --> 37:07.557
All right, so let's start bringing the
elephants across and bring them down.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.695
[Terri] All right.
This is the first time ever.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.330
Let's see how they go.

37:15.032 --> 37:16.666
[Steve] Right.
Doing all right there, Kat?

37:18.336 --> 37:19.369
I'm watching her very carefully.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.737
We've done a lot
of conditioning with them.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.139
We've been playing audio
of different animal sounds.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.108
To try and get them used
to as much as we can.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.811
[elephants trumpeting]

37:27.813 --> 37:29.946
I mean, they, they are, even
though they do get scared by things,

37:29.948 --> 37:32.249
- they're also naturally inquisitive as well.
- Yeah.

37:32.251 --> 37:35.252
[Steve] And so, this is them, they're just
now trying to work out what's going on.

37:35.254 --> 37:37.087
- [Terri] Yeah.
- [Steve] And where this leads to.

37:38.689 --> 37:40.557
So, how's Raflesia doing?

37:40.559 --> 37:42.359
Ah, look. She's so relaxed
right now.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.127
All her body language
is just nice and calm.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.529
- Yeah.
- And she's keeping the whole group nice and calm as well.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.098
- So that's nice.
- Right.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.300
- Uh, Megawati next to her.
- Mm-hmm.

37:50.302 --> 37:53.436
She's her big protector. So that
gives her a sense of security as well.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.439
[Terri] So, I know they're feeling
comfortable and confident with you.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.308
But what are you watching for?

37:58.310 --> 38:00.477
- [Steve] Anything that has, like, loud noises.
- [Terri] Oh!

38:00.479 --> 38:01.845
It could be
a kookaburra flying over.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.613
And some days, they may not
worry about it, but other days,

38:03.615 --> 38:06.182
they might.
Like, Megawati is 2,600 kilos.

38:06.184 --> 38:07.684
- And... yeah.
- [Terri] Oh, my word.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.287
She could be scared of something
small that runs past from the ground.

38:10.289 --> 38:14.457
[Terri] So that's 5,750 pounds.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.526
Math. Stay in school.

38:18.262 --> 38:21.197
[Steve] Okay, Raf's just going
for a bit of an explore right now.

38:21.199 --> 38:25.001
[Terri] Oh wow.
She's so brave.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.704
- [Raflesia grunts] - See, guys,
Raflesia's on the move, okay?

38:27.706 --> 38:30.373
<i>[Terri] So, Raflesia's being
very bold and she's taking</i>

38:30.375 --> 38:33.343
<i>her snack further down
the walkway.</i>

38:33.345 --> 38:36.012
<i>And the other elephants
are following suit.</i>

38:36.014 --> 38:39.416
So, Steve's exactly right. As
long as Raflesia's feeling cool,

38:39.418 --> 38:42.986
everyone else is, like, the
baby's good, everything's fine.

38:42.988 --> 38:46.089
- [Steve] We're on the way, we're on the move.
- Okay, we're on the move.

38:46.091 --> 38:49.292
Initially, we were only gonna
go a few hundred feet.

38:49.294 --> 38:51.328
But they wanted
to explore further.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.029
- Yeah.
- This is so awesome.

38:53.898 --> 38:55.265
[elephant exhales]

38:55.333 --> 38:57.834
[Steve] So, now we gotta encourage
them to walk back down this way.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.170
- Towards an area that they know. Yeah.
- [Terri] Great.

39:00.172 --> 39:03.940
<i>[Terri] Today was step one
and it was very successful.</i>

39:03.942 --> 39:06.943
Megawati, you're doing so good.

39:06.945 --> 39:10.513
But what we have to do is
a whole lot of step one.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.250
Until it becomes a routine.

39:14.252 --> 39:16.586
[Steve] All right. So, we're gonna
take them back to the other yard now.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.988
That could not have gone
any better.

39:18.990 --> 39:22.492
[Terri] But how fun for the elephants.
They'll get to go for a big walk

39:22.494 --> 39:25.195
<i>every single day
and all kinds of weather.</i>

39:25.197 --> 39:27.364
<i>See new things,
smell new things,</i>

39:27.366 --> 39:29.632
it's gonna be nothing
but adventure for them.

39:29.634 --> 39:33.737
I can guarantee they'll be here, once
we get down there, every single day.

39:33.739 --> 39:34.637
- Yes.
- Yeah.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.005
Well, congratulations.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.408
- Thank you. Done.
- Day one. Tick.

39:40.010 --> 39:43.446
<i>When we finally get
our beautiful girls to</i>

39:43.448 --> 39:46.683
<i>comfortably walk to their
on-display habitat,</i>

39:46.685 --> 39:48.752
I think we're gonna
have a big party.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.954
I think it'll be coconuts
for everyone.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.756
[elephant trumpets]

39:58.095 --> 40:02.031
<i>[Robert] I've done almost
600-mile journey.</i>

40:02.033 --> 40:05.001
<i>We've arrived at
the Australian Reptile Park,</i>

40:05.003 --> 40:07.837
<i>which is the gators'
brand new home.</i>

40:07.839 --> 40:11.241
<i>And now comes the most
challenging and exciting part,</i>

40:11.243 --> 40:13.843
releasing the gators
into this brand new place.

40:16.213 --> 40:19.182
- Morning team. How are we?
- Hey, guys. How are you?

40:19.184 --> 40:21.618
Good, good. How was the trip?

40:21.620 --> 40:23.520
- Travel was perfect.
- Great! Well...

40:23.522 --> 40:25.321
It's not something we do
everyday, is it?

40:25.323 --> 40:27.657
[laughs] What a way to spend
a day. Ten big gators.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.559
[Robert] Oh, it's gonna be nuts.

40:29.561 --> 40:32.896
So, the Australian Reptile Park
is a facility that Australia Zoo

40:32.898 --> 40:35.598
has had a long
standing relationship with.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.035
These guys love reptiles
as much as we do. So...

40:39.037 --> 40:43.706
We're really happy that the
gators are going to a great home.

40:43.708 --> 40:46.443
This is kind of uncharted
territory for us,

40:46.445 --> 40:49.212
in terms of, you know, this is
your enclosure, your gators,

40:49.214 --> 40:51.514
you know what
their demeanor's like. So...

40:51.516 --> 40:53.049
we'll be guided by you.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.419
Yeah, we've got some 350 kilo boys
that don't mind chasing you around.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.222
So, um, I certainly don't want
one of them grabbing on one of us.

40:59.224 --> 41:02.058
<i>So, we'll have a couple of
guys on sticks to push them back,</i>

41:02.060 --> 41:03.993
<i>but for any reason,
if one comes charging,</i>

41:03.995 --> 41:06.563
we'll all be out, we've all worked
with big gators before, so...

41:06.565 --> 41:09.065
- But, I mean, no bites, hey?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.700
- It's gonna be good.
- Let's get into it, eh?

41:10.702 --> 41:12.569
- Sounds good, let's do it.
- All right.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.705
Okay. You guys good?

41:15.707 --> 41:19.075
- So, we've got Tyler here.
- [man] Yep, yep.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.412
<i>[Robert] This lagoon that they're
going into is bigger than the lagoon</i>

41:22.414 --> 41:24.047
<i>that we have back at home.</i>

41:24.049 --> 41:26.182
<i>There's 30 gators in here,</i>

41:26.184 --> 41:27.650
and there's actually
a few females.

41:30.054 --> 41:31.888
<i>Now, in the gator world,</i>

41:31.890 --> 41:35.258
<i>girls are a lot more feisty
than the males.</i>

41:36.460 --> 41:39.162
<i>They're territorial.
They wanna defend their home.</i>

41:39.164 --> 41:41.231
<i>You know, they all have
their little hierarchy.</i>

41:41.233 --> 41:43.566
That's gonna be the big
thing that we contend with,

41:43.568 --> 41:44.968
trying to release these gators.

41:46.403 --> 41:48.571
Just watch that
big boy's up, yeah?

41:48.573 --> 41:50.540
[Robert] Oh, jeez.
That's a unit.

41:50.542 --> 41:54.077
Jeez, some big gators
in there. Hoo.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.681
- [drilling]
- One upcoming, yeah. Okay.

41:58.683 --> 42:02.752
<i>When the gators go into the water,
we really don't know what to expect.</i>

42:02.754 --> 42:04.954
Are the animals that are
already in the enclosure

42:04.956 --> 42:07.223
going to be
aggressive immediately?

42:07.225 --> 42:10.860
<i>Because there will be some
form of hierarchy established</i>

42:10.862 --> 42:12.629
<i>in that pond as it is.</i>

42:12.631 --> 42:16.733
<i>And ten new animals going
in will significantly disrupt that.</i>

42:16.735 --> 42:19.002
<i>So, we just need to be sure
that they're not going</i>

42:19.004 --> 42:21.804
<i>straight into
a volatile situation.</i>

42:21.806 --> 42:24.073
And that they settle in
really well.

42:24.075 --> 42:25.975
- You got it, Zac?
- Yeah.

42:25.977 --> 42:29.045
- [Robert] Are we happy?
- Should be everything off now, mate.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.947
- Yep, we're good?
- We're good.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.549
- Two. Okay, yeah. Ready?
- Yeah.

42:33.584 --> 42:36.052
[Robert] Hello, Flavor Flav.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.754
- All right. He's coming out.
- [Robert] Yep.

42:38.522 --> 42:41.491
Good boy.
Good boy, Flavor Flav.

42:41.493 --> 42:44.294
- [man] Is his head out a little bit?
- Yeah, head's out.

42:44.296 --> 42:47.230
- You wanna scalp a little bit?
- Yeah. Yeah a little bit.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.065
[growls]

42:49.067 --> 42:53.236
- You all right now. You all right.
- [roaring and growling]

42:53.238 --> 42:56.005
- He's one fired up boy, hey?
- Back up. He is a bit.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.206
You all right.

42:58.208 --> 42:59.809
There you go.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.811
- That is a gorgeous gator.
- [man] That's a stunning gator.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.346
Look at those heads
all popping out.

43:03.348 --> 43:04.681
[Robert] Yeah.

43:06.817 --> 43:09.419
So, changes that social
dynamic a little bit.

43:12.723 --> 43:15.024
But hopefully, he should
integrate in really well. But...

43:15.026 --> 43:17.360
now, that, that went good.
You always wanna see...

43:17.362 --> 43:21.531
alligators that are firing on all pistons,
that's what you want. That's good.

43:21.533 --> 43:23.132
Jeez, first one.
If this sets the dive

43:23.134 --> 43:24.968
for the rest of them,
this is gonna be interesting.

43:24.970 --> 43:26.602
Hey. [laughs]

43:39.316 --> 43:44.187
<i>[Bindi] Today, I really wanna see
that Stella's joey has put on weight.</i>

43:44.189 --> 43:46.856
<i>Last time, Kirsten was quite
worried about him.</i>

43:46.858 --> 43:49.459
[Kirsten] Stella's joey,
it's five and a half ounces.

43:49.461 --> 43:51.027
That's small.

43:51.562 --> 43:53.162
That is very small.

43:53.230 --> 43:56.766
<i>[Bindi] So, I'm hoping that he's
doing really well and growing properly.</i>

43:57.868 --> 44:01.437
- Oh, hey, guys. How's it going?
- Hello.

44:01.439 --> 44:05.108
- It's doing really well.
- [Bindi] Oh, my very word.

44:05.110 --> 44:08.111
- Honey, you look so good.
- [Kirsten] Very well.

44:08.113 --> 44:10.546
It looks a little bit scruffy.
I think he just got up.

44:10.548 --> 44:12.448
He's... [laughs]
I look the same way.

44:12.450 --> 44:15.051
You don't even wanna
see me in the mornings, jeez.

44:15.053 --> 44:17.453
[Kirsten] We were really,
really quite concerned.

44:17.455 --> 44:19.722
- And look, he's still very small.
- Yeah.

44:19.724 --> 44:21.591
[Kirsten] But I think
he's just small statured.

44:21.593 --> 44:25.194
And he has almost doubled
his weight.

44:25.196 --> 44:27.630
- Oh, my word.
- He was only five and a bit ounces

44:27.632 --> 44:30.266
<i>when we first weighed him,
now to be over 12.</i>

44:30.268 --> 44:31.968
That's significant.

44:35.072 --> 44:38.474
I'm so relieved that
this little guy is doing well.

44:39.109 --> 44:41.711
He's got his fluff now.

44:41.713 --> 44:43.479
He's gaining weight.

44:43.481 --> 44:45.948
And just look at how bright
his eyes are.

44:45.950 --> 44:48.851
Oh my word, you are the
cutest little munchkin in the world.

44:48.853 --> 44:52.388
Can I ask,
have we named him yet?

44:52.390 --> 44:56.459
- We have not.
- You haven't yet? Oh, my word.

44:56.461 --> 45:01.330
Do you think it would be okay
if we named him Edward?

45:01.332 --> 45:03.399
[Kirsten] That is
a beautiful name.

45:03.401 --> 45:07.837
What do you think? And your
mama needs to go now. [laughs]

45:09.206 --> 45:11.474
You are an amazing mom, Stella.

45:11.476 --> 45:15.545
Holy dooley. I wanna be like
you when I grow up. [laughs]

45:15.846 --> 45:17.013
All right.

45:19.116 --> 45:21.417
It's so joyful
to have moments like this.

45:21.419 --> 45:25.221
- Especially after last year was such a...
- The challenge.

45:25.223 --> 45:28.157
We've come through it, we're at
the other side now. And we have

45:28.159 --> 45:30.359
ten amazing joeys.

45:30.361 --> 45:32.829
To, to get us through
the next 12 months.

45:32.831 --> 45:35.732
And the joy that we'll have
watching them develop

45:35.734 --> 45:39.602
is just so exciting and
such a relief. We really...

45:39.604 --> 45:41.971
As a species, I think
they needed it,

45:41.973 --> 45:45.041
- but as keepers as well, we needed it.
- Yeah.

45:45.043 --> 45:48.077
We needed this success, this...

45:48.079 --> 45:51.347
positive outlook, this hope for
the future, and that's what they are.

45:51.349 --> 45:53.683
- I agree.
- [Kirsten] And it never gets old.

45:54.918 --> 45:58.287
<i>[Bindi] I'm so proud
of our koala breeding program</i>

45:58.289 --> 46:02.558
<i>that will continue on
years into the future.</i>

46:02.560 --> 46:06.229
And as long as I live, I will
do my very best to make sure

46:06.231 --> 46:08.498
koalas are protected
on the planet.

46:14.004 --> 46:15.438
Ready?

46:17.174 --> 46:20.443
- Jeez.
- Oh!

46:22.479 --> 46:24.647
[Robert] He's coming right off.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.084
- Hey.
- He wasn't messing around, no.

46:29.987 --> 46:31.754
[all laugh]

46:32.322 --> 46:33.756
[man] Ready, set, go.

46:33.758 --> 46:37.059
- Hey, big fellow.
- I think he's a little apprehensive.

46:38.128 --> 46:39.562
Knows what's in that lagoon.

46:39.564 --> 46:41.531
- The girls. He's scared.
- Yeah, yeah.

46:41.533 --> 46:42.965
The girls you ought to be
afraid of.

46:44.067 --> 46:46.836
<i>So far, we've released
eight of the gators.</i>

46:46.838 --> 46:49.338
- Anyone else...
- [all laugh]

46:49.340 --> 46:51.440
- Just you, mate.
- [Robert] We got the biggest left.

46:51.442 --> 46:53.209
You're gonna need
to get your reserves going.

46:53.211 --> 46:56.179
- I don't usually work this hard.
- [all laugh]

46:56.181 --> 46:57.847
- [man] We know.
- [all laugh]

46:59.183 --> 47:02.351
We're covered in mud,
we're sweating, we're sore.

47:02.353 --> 47:05.454
But we've saved the most
challenging for last.

47:05.456 --> 47:06.889
This one's got some weight, hey?

47:06.891 --> 47:09.425
<i>[Robert] There's two big boxes
left on the truck</i>

47:09.427 --> 47:11.494
<i>with the really big boy gators.</i>

47:12.229 --> 47:13.663
This guy here is Clive.

47:13.665 --> 47:16.165
- There's still rope on him there.
- [man] I know.

47:16.167 --> 47:18.668
- All right. I'll try and get this rope off.
- [man] Yep.

47:18.670 --> 47:20.736
- He's big.
- [roars]

47:22.573 --> 47:24.807
Last bit. Ah, perfect.

47:24.809 --> 47:26.609
- Nice work, mate.
- He'll flow down.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.044
Watch him swinging on you...

47:28.712 --> 47:30.980
Oh, get some. Woo!

47:32.149 --> 47:34.550
All right. Well, that's second
to last.

47:34.552 --> 47:36.853
Now, we've got the big boy.

47:40.257 --> 47:43.392
Big, bad Beau is the last one
to come out.

47:44.361 --> 47:46.362
Have a go at the size of him.

47:46.364 --> 47:47.997
His girth is like, that.

47:47.999 --> 47:51.200
He is gonna be a weapon.

47:51.202 --> 47:55.004
That monster gator who's waiting
in there, building up all of his energy.

47:55.006 --> 47:57.373
[indistinct chatter]

47:57.375 --> 47:59.208
- All right.
- [sighs]

47:59.210 --> 48:00.476
[Robert] Hey, Beau-Beau.

48:01.612 --> 48:04.347
- [drilling] - He's got that
crazy look in his eyes.

48:05.082 --> 48:06.515
Interesting.

48:07.618 --> 48:09.552
Okay. Good to go. Ready?

48:09.554 --> 48:11.287
- Okay, you guys all good?
- Yeah, we're good.

48:13.390 --> 48:15.658
- [man] Okay. One, two, three.
- [Robert] Three, good.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.493
He's coming out.
He's coming out.

48:17.495 --> 48:19.495
- Little bit more.
- Little bit more.

48:19.497 --> 48:21.230
Now, I reckon we try the shimmy?

48:21.232 --> 48:23.766
- Ready? One, two, three.
- [growling]

48:24.701 --> 48:26.302
You're all right, big boy.

48:26.304 --> 48:29.405
- One, two, three, watch that side swing.
- [man] Yep, yep.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.607
One more. He's good.
He's good. He's coming.

48:31.609 --> 48:33.175
Good boy, yeah.

48:33.177 --> 48:34.744
Good boy, Dinosaur.

48:35.212 --> 48:36.812
All right.

48:37.648 --> 48:38.781
Good boy.

48:39.983 --> 48:41.517
Look at the size of him.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.520
Have a good life, Beau.

48:45.355 --> 48:46.555
Good boy.

48:47.658 --> 48:49.125
What a weapon.

48:49.493 --> 48:50.826
Last gator in!

48:50.828 --> 48:53.296
- [man] Great work.
- Crikey, that was a bit of work.

48:53.298 --> 48:54.263
Well done, guys.

48:54.265 --> 48:55.398
- [splashing]
- Oh, he's off.

48:55.400 --> 48:57.099
- There he goes.
- Nice little kick to round it out.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.936
- Good try.
- Good on you as well.

48:59.938 --> 49:03.105
Oh, how good was that?
That just went perfectly.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.408
They're gonna be some
really happy gators in there.

49:05.410 --> 49:08.344
- Beautiful girls to mix with.
- [man] Sure we're getting lots of eggs this year.

49:08.346 --> 49:11.314
- [all laughing] - There'll be
lots of breeding, lots of eggs.

49:11.316 --> 49:14.016
- Oh, yeah. Hopefully, not too many fights.
- No.

49:15.052 --> 49:17.820
<i>This has been an insane
24 hours.</i>

49:17.822 --> 49:20.923
- And pull.
<i>- The biggest move in Australia Zoo's history.</i>

49:20.925 --> 49:23.859
<i>The biggest move in the
Australian Reptile Park's history.</i>

49:25.095 --> 49:26.028
You're all right, mate.

49:26.030 --> 49:28.197
And I think that
for me, personally,

49:28.199 --> 49:30.566
<i>I think back to watching
all the old footage</i>

49:30.568 --> 49:32.802
<i>of my mum and dad
in the mud, moving gators...</i>

49:35.005 --> 49:36.806
<i>And now I get to do
the exact same thing.</i>

49:36.808 --> 49:38.074
Oh, big man.

49:38.076 --> 49:40.109
And not just be part of it,
but lead it.

49:41.712 --> 49:44.413
<i>And fill those boots,
it's big boots to fill</i>

49:44.415 --> 49:46.582
<i>but it's a huge honor.</i>

49:46.584 --> 49:49.085
And I reckon
he'd be pretty stoked.

49:49.087 --> 49:50.152
Whoo!

49:50.154 --> 49:52.221
Biggest gator move
in the Zoo history.

49:52.223 --> 49:55.124
Bigger than anything that
even he did, so... [sighs]

49:55.126 --> 49:57.159
What a day. What a day.
