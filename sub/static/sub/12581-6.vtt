00:32.594 --> 00:33.583
BOBBY:
I got it.

00:34.028 --> 00:34.926
I got it.

00:36.331 --> 00:38.094
HANK:
Oh, dang it, Bobby

00:38.132 --> 00:40.464
football tryouts are
in two days.

00:40.501 --> 00:41.468
So?

00:41.502 --> 00:43.026
I'll just be
running back.

00:43.071 --> 00:44.766
That was your
position, right?

00:44.806 --> 00:45.966
They have to
give it to me.

00:46.007 --> 00:48.066
Son, you don't get
to be running back

00:48.109 --> 00:49.633
just because your dad was.

00:49.677 --> 00:52.942
We fought a whole war
with England over that.

00:52.981 --> 00:54.039
(sighs)

00:54.082 --> 00:56.050
Maybe you should go out
for center.

00:56.084 --> 00:58.552
It'll allow you
to put your God-given immobility

00:58.586 --> 00:59.553
to good use.

00:59.587 --> 01:02.784
Oy.

01:02.824 --> 01:07.693
Ready, set, hike!

01:07.729 --> 01:08.696
Bobby?

01:08.730 --> 01:09.697
Snap the ball.
Uh

01:09.731 --> 01:12.894
this ball's the only thing
holding me up right now.

01:12.934 --> 01:16.165
I know
what you're going through, Hank.

01:16.204 --> 01:18.570
Joseph doesn’t want
to follow in my footsteps

01:18.606 --> 01:19.698
as towel manager.

01:19.741 --> 01:22.539
He wants to be quarterback.

01:22.577 --> 01:24.568
Maybe Bobby could
be towel manager.

01:24.612 --> 01:27.103
I want Bobby to compete
for a spot on the team.

01:27.148 --> 01:29.048
I don’t want him
just handed it.

01:29.083 --> 01:30.050
Handed it?!

01:30.084 --> 01:31.210
Towel tryouts are brutal.

01:31.252 --> 01:33.220
And word down
at the Laundromat is

01:33.254 --> 01:34.812
there's this girl, Kathleen.

01:34.856 --> 01:36.380
She's the one to beat.

01:36.424 --> 01:38.517
Spent the last three summers
folding linens

01:38.559 --> 01:40.891
at Bed, Bath and Beyond.

01:40.928 --> 01:42.896
Well, at least
you'd be part of the team

01:42.930 --> 01:45.956
and you'd get to hear
the coach's pep talk.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.092
Yeah, this might work.

01:47.135 --> 01:48.329
Sounds good
to me.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.303
I love towels.

01:50.338 --> 01:51.464
I'll be just like that bear

01:51.506 --> 01:53.872
in the fabric softener
commercial.

01:53.908 --> 01:55.341
Oh.

01:55.376 --> 01:59.142
(grunts)

02:01.883 --> 02:10.051
Nice, Gribble.

02:10.091 --> 02:12.321
(blowing whistle)

02:12.360 --> 02:17.127
I take a lot of baths.

02:17.165 --> 02:18.655
So, I finally
got up the guts

02:18.700 --> 02:19.667
to ask Nancy

02:19.701 --> 02:21.259
for a raise in
my allowance.

02:21.302 --> 02:24.237
It did not
go well.

02:24.272 --> 02:25.933
BOBBY:
I did it, Dad.

02:25.973 --> 02:27.634
I'm the new towel manager.

02:27.675 --> 02:29.700
Though I couldn't have
done it without Joseph.

02:29.744 --> 02:33.111
He worked up quite a
sweat making quarterback.

02:33.147 --> 02:34.114
All right.

02:34.148 --> 02:35.410
That's good.
Way to go.

02:35.450 --> 02:36.417
All right,
Bobby.

02:36.451 --> 02:38.419
My boy is on a team.

02:38.453 --> 02:40.045
Not a squad,
not a club.

02:40.088 --> 02:45.025
A team.

02:45.059 --> 02:47.493
Yeah.

02:47.528 --> 02:52.556
Yeah, eah!

02:52.600 --> 02:54.568
Dale, what are
you cheering for?

02:54.602 --> 02:56.570
Joseph just
threw an
interception.

02:56.604 --> 02:57.571
Huh?

02:57.605 --> 02:59.573
Bobby just handed
off the fresh towels

02:59.607 --> 03:01.040
put the dirties
in the hamper

03:01.075 --> 03:02.235
and didn't fumble once.

03:02.276 --> 03:03.937
That's the hat trick.

03:03.978 --> 03:04.945
Really?

03:04.979 --> 03:05.946
(soft chuckle)

03:05.980 --> 03:06.947
Well, all right.

03:06.981 --> 03:07.948
Go, Bobby!

03:07.982 --> 03:09.847
Show that hamper
who's boss.

03:09.884 --> 03:11.442
(whistle blowing)

03:11.486 --> 03:12.646
Good practice, boys.

03:12.687 --> 03:13.984
Whattaburgers on me.

03:14.021 --> 03:16.216
Hill, you ain't going anywhere

03:16.257 --> 03:19.658
till every jockstrap is
as clean as a surgeon's mask.

03:23.965 --> 03:25.091
Hey, Towel Manager.

03:25.133 --> 03:27.397
Got a little time
for an old running back?

03:27.435 --> 03:29.164
Oh, this stinks.

03:29.203 --> 03:31.899
All I do is get towel-snapped
by the players

03:31.939 --> 03:33.770
and yelled at by Coach.

03:33.808 --> 03:34.832
He yelled at you?

03:34.876 --> 03:35.843
Really? What did he say?

03:35.877 --> 03:37.367
He said, "Hill..."

03:37.412 --> 03:38.970
He knows your name?

03:39.013 --> 03:42.608
Well, that means
you're really part of the team.

03:42.650 --> 03:43.617
Well

03:43.651 --> 03:48.611
looks like you've got some
hard work ahead of you.

03:48.656 --> 03:51.557
Enjoy it,
because you've earned it.

03:51.592 --> 03:54.755
(sighs)

03:55.596 --> 03:58.087
(sniffing)

03:58.132 --> 04:01.226
Mm.

04:01.269 --> 04:02.236
MINH:
Bobby Hill

04:02.270 --> 04:04.830
those roses not squirt water
if that's what you looking for.

04:04.872 --> 04:07.636
They're lovely.

04:07.675 --> 04:08.903
I started growing roses

04:08.943 --> 04:12.242
after the doctor cut off
my Xanax.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.145
Very relaxing
to have total control

04:14.182 --> 04:16.343
of another living thing.

04:16.384 --> 04:17.577
Mind if I try?

04:17.618 --> 04:21.076
Okay, but just one.

04:21.122 --> 04:24.285
Oh, this is kind of nice.

04:24.325 --> 04:28.284
And they smell so much
better than jock straps.

04:28.329 --> 04:30.297
Hmm, maybe to you.

04:30.331 --> 04:31.320
(sniffing)

04:31.365 --> 04:32.389
PEGGY:
Bobby

04:32.433 --> 04:38.235
are you sniffing glue
or feeding a wounded bird?

04:38.272 --> 04:43.642
Either way, I will not have it
at my dinner table.

04:43.678 --> 04:45.111
It's a flower

04:45.146 --> 04:47.114
from Mrs. Souphanousinphone's
garden.

04:47.148 --> 04:49.582
Mom, you ever think
about growing roses?

04:49.617 --> 04:50.948
Of course not.

04:50.985 --> 04:53.545
Do you think I want my house
to look like a grave?

04:53.588 --> 04:54.612
Now, hold on here.

04:54.655 --> 04:56.680
I don’t want to hear
about any roses

04:56.724 --> 04:58.692
unless we're talking
about the Rose Bowl.

04:58.726 --> 05:01.354
Hey, maybe you could
towel manage that someday.

05:01.395 --> 05:03.192
I'm not sure I...

05:03.231 --> 05:04.198
Good point.

05:04.232 --> 05:05.199
You've got to hone your skills.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.861
The game this week will
be a real test.

05:07.902 --> 05:11.030
It'll be your first time folding
in front of a crowd.

05:11.072 --> 05:13.870
Quick son, show me
what you've got.

05:13.908 --> 05:16.035
(sighs)

05:16.077 --> 05:20.514
Can I help you?

05:20.548 --> 05:23.540
Which one of these sticks is
going to turn into roses?

05:23.584 --> 05:27.042
That one... maybe.

05:27.088 --> 05:28.055
I don't know.

05:28.089 --> 05:29.989
I just got transferred
from fabrics.

05:30.024 --> 05:31.491
It says roses.

05:31.526 --> 05:32.754
Yeah, I told you.

05:32.793 --> 05:34.852
Okay, the tag says

05:34.896 --> 05:38.889
they need food and water
and sun and dirt and love.

05:38.933 --> 05:41.060
Can I substitute
extra love for sun?

05:41.102 --> 05:44.299
I kind of have to hide
these in my bedroom closet.

05:44.338 --> 05:45.305
No way, man.

05:45.339 --> 05:49.173
That'd be going
against the tag unless...

05:49.210 --> 05:51.542
Okay, I know someone
who can help you

05:51.579 --> 05:54.173
but the problem is
that he's at another store

05:54.215 --> 05:56.183
and, like, you're at this store.

05:56.217 --> 05:57.309
I have a bike.

05:57.351 --> 06:01.412
Oh, that changes everything.

06:09.997 --> 06:11.430
Can I help you?
Yes.

06:11.465 --> 06:14.434
Uh, Ricky
at the Mega Lo Mart told me

06:14.468 --> 06:16.993
to see you
about growing stuff indoors.

06:17.038 --> 06:18.437
Don’t say anything.

06:18.472 --> 06:21.407
He told me to tell you I'm cool.

06:21.442 --> 06:23.069
He's cool.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.169
So, uh, what kind
of herbage you growing?

06:25.212 --> 06:26.645
They're roses.

06:26.681 --> 06:28.672
Oh. Well, those are legal now.

06:28.716 --> 06:30.206
You can grow them outside.

06:30.251 --> 06:33.948
My dad doesn't like me outside
unless I'm on a football field.

06:33.988 --> 06:36.582
He only wants me to do stuff
that you can win.

06:36.624 --> 06:39.787
You tell your dad
that Lao Tzu said

06:39.827 --> 06:42.557
"The wise stay behind
and go ahead.

06:42.597 --> 06:44.895
They want nothing
and have everything."

06:44.932 --> 06:46.456
Yeah.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.024
Huh?

06:48.069 --> 06:49.036
It means competing

06:49.070 --> 06:51.903
against others is not
the way to happiness.

06:51.939 --> 06:53.907
You want to know more,
check this out.

06:53.941 --> 06:55.704
"Chinese philosophy."

06:55.743 --> 07:00.305
Huh. Is that why
you guys seem so happy?

07:00.348 --> 07:02.748
(laughter)

07:04.585 --> 07:06.109
(click, buzzing)

07:06.153 --> 07:08.144
"One cannot cause growth;

07:08.189 --> 07:13.149
one can only let growth."

07:13.194 --> 07:14.923
Huh.

07:14.962 --> 07:16.361
We're getting
skunked.

07:16.397 --> 07:20.060
How is this
happening?

07:20.101 --> 07:21.033
Oh, my God.

07:21.068 --> 07:22.660
Where's Bobby?

07:22.703 --> 07:23.397
(screams)

07:23.437 --> 07:24.301
Blue 32.

07:24.338 --> 07:25.464
Blue 32.

07:25.506 --> 07:29.169
Yikes.

07:34.382 --> 07:36.714
No! He's going the wrong way!

07:36.751 --> 07:37.945
I've seen this before.

07:37.985 --> 07:40.146
It's total towel chaos.

07:40.187 --> 07:41.279
The team needs me!

07:41.322 --> 07:43.085
I'm coming, Joseph!

07:43.124 --> 07:45.957
I'm coming to wipe you!

07:47.495 --> 07:49.292
Bobby!

07:58.339 --> 08:00.307
I don't know
what I'm going to do

08:00.341 --> 08:01.308
when I see him.

08:01.342 --> 08:02.309
I might kill him.

08:02.343 --> 08:03.310
HANK:
Bobby

08:03.344 --> 08:07.371
if you're going
to hide from me

08:07.415 --> 08:08.382
at least have
the guts

08:08.416 --> 08:09.678
to do it without
a night light.

08:09.717 --> 08:11.776
Hey, Dad.

08:11.819 --> 08:12.786
What's going?

08:12.820 --> 08:13.787
(gasps)

08:13.821 --> 08:14.788
The game!

08:14.822 --> 08:17.655
It was disaster.

08:17.692 --> 08:19.660
There was sweat and mud
everywhere.

08:19.694 --> 08:21.559
Oh, God, the slipping.

08:21.595 --> 08:23.563
The horrible slipping!

08:23.597 --> 08:25.462
You got cut from the team.

08:25.499 --> 08:27.967
Kathleen Barnes is the new
towel manager.

08:28.002 --> 08:29.094
DALE:
Thanks to you

08:29.136 --> 08:31.604
a girl is doing our team’s
laundry.

08:31.639 --> 08:35.769
Now get out of my sight!

08:35.809 --> 08:39.746
This house is going
to be TP'd tonight.

08:39.780 --> 08:40.871
That's a given.

08:40.914 --> 08:43.042
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

08:43.083 --> 08:44.142
Well, I guess

08:44.184 --> 08:46.710
towel manager wasn’t
in my cosmic path.

08:46.754 --> 08:48.153
I wish Kathleen

08:48.189 --> 08:50.521
all the best of karma.

08:50.558 --> 08:52.492
The best of what?

08:52.526 --> 08:54.494
What were you doing
in that closet?

08:54.528 --> 08:55.495
Nothing.

08:55.529 --> 08:56.621
Sticks

08:56.664 --> 09:00.100
and lights?

09:00.134 --> 09:02.261
Is this some kind
of puppet theater?

09:02.303 --> 09:05.067
They're roses, Dad.

09:05.106 --> 09:07.404
(sighs)

09:07.441 --> 09:08.601
Roses.

09:08.642 --> 09:09.734
I'm trying to teach the boy

09:09.777 --> 09:11.745
how to compete
in the real world

09:11.779 --> 09:13.747
build up his confidence a little

09:13.781 --> 09:15.749
and all he wants
to do is sniff flowers.

09:15.783 --> 09:16.750
Oh, Hank

09:16.784 --> 09:17.751
what's the big deal?

09:17.785 --> 09:19.753
Well, now I know
where Bobby gets his

09:19.787 --> 09:21.414
"what's the big deal"
attitude.

09:21.455 --> 09:23.423
Well, if it's so
important to you

09:23.457 --> 09:25.652
take him to go see a
rose growing competition.

09:25.693 --> 09:26.887
Rose competition?

09:26.927 --> 09:29.157
Come on, Peggy,
there's no such thing.

09:29.196 --> 09:30.220
Oh, yes, there is.

09:30.264 --> 09:32.232
Minh goes all the time.

09:32.266 --> 09:33.290
It's probably because

09:33.334 --> 09:35.564
she's very unhappy
in her marriage.

09:35.603 --> 09:37.935
So? What, I pretend
it's a sport and...

09:37.972 --> 09:38.939
And he'll pay
attention

09:38.973 --> 09:40.964
because it's
something he loves.

09:41.008 --> 09:42.976
It's like when I try
to get through to you

09:43.010 --> 09:44.341
I mention propane.

09:44.378 --> 09:45.345
Huh.

09:45.379 --> 09:46.346
Bobby, I've got some good news

09:46.380 --> 09:48.905
but I want you to promise

09:48.949 --> 09:53.409
you're not going to squeal
like a girl.

09:53.454 --> 09:55.649
I've decided
to let you grow your roses.

09:55.689 --> 09:58.249
(high-pitched squeal)

09:58.292 --> 09:59.259
Ugh.

09:59.293 --> 10:00.851
And the best part is

10:00.895 --> 10:03.921
I'm entering you
into a rose contest.

10:03.964 --> 10:06.558
You get to compete
against the top, uh...

10:06.600 --> 10:10.001
old women, I imagine,
in the county.

10:10.037 --> 10:11.004
Compete?

10:11.038 --> 10:13.905
But Lao Tzu says
the way of the sage is to act

10:13.941 --> 10:15.636
but not to compete.

10:15.676 --> 10:17.644
There... that thing
you just said...

10:17.678 --> 10:19.270
that's what I'm trying to fix.

10:19.313 --> 10:20.280
Son

10:20.314 --> 10:22.043
you've got to try at something

10:22.082 --> 10:24.175
and give it your best shot.

10:24.218 --> 10:25.185
You like flowers?

10:25.219 --> 10:26.777
Well, make us proud

10:26.821 --> 10:29.813
and be the best
damn rose grower in town.

10:29.857 --> 10:31.825
Now, what do you say,
tough guy?

10:31.859 --> 10:34.453
Are you ready to grow the hell
out of those roses?

10:34.495 --> 10:35.826
You bet I am!

10:35.863 --> 10:37.888
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

10:37.932 --> 10:38.899
Outside.

10:38.933 --> 10:41.163
Now that you're okay with them,
I might as well

10:41.202 --> 10:44.171
put these thirsty little piggies
in the ground.

10:44.205 --> 10:46.765
Now, where did I put
that floppy gardening hat?

10:46.807 --> 10:48.206
You can't grow them outside.

10:48.242 --> 10:49.368
People will see you

10:49.410 --> 10:52.106
and, uh...
steal your gardening secrets.

10:52.146 --> 10:54.944
You'd better stay in
the closet until you win.

10:54.982 --> 10:57.041
Then you can plant
them in the front yard

10:57.084 --> 10:59.052
and if anybody
gives you any guff

10:59.086 --> 11:00.053
you can show 'em
your trophy.

11:00.087 --> 11:02.021
Or sash.

11:02.056 --> 11:03.421
Or sash.

11:10.464 --> 11:13.160
MAN:
Check out
that engine.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.130
It hauls so much ass
I can drive it to work.

11:16.170 --> 11:18.138
Yeah, she's a monster.

11:23.043 --> 11:24.010
Oh, I'll get it.

11:24.044 --> 11:28.276
Yeah, uh, hello ladies.

11:28.315 --> 11:30.112
Uh, I'm here to, um

11:30.150 --> 11:34.587
sign for that, uh,
big rose-off you got going on.

11:34.622 --> 11:38.251
Are you that guy
who just moved in from Portland?

11:38.292 --> 11:41.784
Grew the Madame Plantier
that won Mini Princess of Show?

11:41.829 --> 11:45.526
Well, I understood that one
word, "grew," but I do know

11:45.566 --> 11:48.535
I am not the Mini Princess
of anything.

11:48.569 --> 11:49.536
Why not?

11:49.570 --> 11:51.037
Forget to prune your side buds?

11:51.071 --> 11:52.038
(laughter)

11:52.072 --> 11:54.040
Here's a sign-up sheet
for the show.

11:54.074 --> 11:57.669
Don't let 'em get to you.

11:57.711 --> 11:58.678
They treat anybody

11:58.712 --> 12:00.680
who wasn't sponsored
by Miracle Gro

12:00.714 --> 12:01.840
lower than fertilizer.

12:01.882 --> 12:03.179
Excuse my language.

12:03.217 --> 12:04.684
Oh, no problem.

12:04.718 --> 12:06.686
So, how many pounds
was the rose

12:06.720 --> 12:07.687
that won last year?

12:07.721 --> 12:09.655
Pounds? Is that a joke?

12:09.690 --> 12:12.488
No. I mean, I saw that
pumpkin on the news

12:12.526 --> 12:14.960
they had to carry
out on a forklift.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.963
Bigger is better at
these things, right?

12:16.997 --> 12:19.488
Size is only ten percent
of your score.

12:19.533 --> 12:23.128
There's Form, Color, Substance,
Stem and Foliage

12:23.170 --> 12:25.161
Balance and Proportion.

12:25.205 --> 12:26.229
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

12:26.273 --> 12:29.936
Cultivating roses isn't some
moron hobby like lawn growing.

12:29.977 --> 12:30.944
It's science

12:30.978 --> 12:31.945
and art.

12:31.979 --> 12:33.947
You think you can just
wake up one morning

12:33.981 --> 12:35.949
flip on a pair
of gardening clogs

12:35.983 --> 12:36.950
and play with the big boys?

12:36.984 --> 12:38.008
No, sir.

12:38.052 --> 12:40.145
Hey, no reason to
get excited here.

12:40.187 --> 12:42.917
My wife and I are just trying
to get our son involved

12:42.957 --> 12:45.289
in something easy
to give him a little confidence.

12:45.326 --> 12:46.725
Your son?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.955
A little boy should be
collecting baseball cards

12:48.996 --> 12:50.429
and catching fireflies.

12:50.464 --> 12:52.125
Not spending sleepless nights

12:52.166 --> 12:54.430
trying to urge the perfect
rose bud to blossom.

12:54.468 --> 12:56.368
How dare you steal that boy's
innocence!

12:56.403 --> 12:58.371
Now get out
of this gardening section.

12:58.405 --> 13:00.373
You make me sick.

13:07.514 --> 13:09.379
BOBBY:
♪ I am your sunshine ♪

13:09.416 --> 13:11.441
(Hank inhales sharply)

13:11.485 --> 13:12.747
♪ Your only sunshine ♪

13:12.786 --> 13:14.253
Am I in? Am I in?!

13:14.288 --> 13:16.483
You're in, all right... tiger.

13:16.523 --> 13:18.457
This is so great!

13:18.492 --> 13:20.653
I don't know if it's
the stem massage or my singing

13:20.694 --> 13:23.663
but these babies are really
responding to something.

13:23.697 --> 13:26.666
MORGAN:
You think you can just wake up
one morning

13:26.700 --> 13:28.668
flip on a pair
of gardening clogs

13:28.702 --> 13:29.930
and play with the big boys?

13:29.970 --> 13:34.236
Uh... you know, this closet
is bigger than it looks.

13:34.274 --> 13:36.640
Mind if I sit in and help a bit?

13:36.677 --> 13:38.235
You mean it? Sure!

13:38.278 --> 13:40.644
That whoopee cushion
doesn’t work

13:40.748 --> 13:42.272
but you can still use it
as a cushion.

13:43.183 --> 13:44.980
(sound of wind breaking)

13:45.085 --> 13:46.450
Hey, you fixed it!

13:52.493 --> 13:55.428
Wait, am I supposed
to cut above the bud
or under the bud?

13:55.462 --> 14:01.401
Well, Lao Tzu would say
that you must let
the cut make itself.

14:01.435 --> 14:06.634
Yeah. Uh, I'm going to
check the American Rose
Association rule book.

14:06.673 --> 14:10.006
Oh, my god, listen to
all these reasons we
can be disqualified.

14:10.044 --> 14:14.071
Misnaming, misclassing,
unlabeled, mislabeled...

14:14.114 --> 14:15.342
stem on stem?

14:15.382 --> 14:17.043
Are we stem on stemming?

14:17.084 --> 14:18.608
Dad, you got to relax.

14:18.652 --> 14:20.677
Roses can pick up
on your vibe.

14:20.721 --> 14:21.688
Dang it, Bobby

14:21.722 --> 14:23.155
cut the Benihana talk.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.658
Okay, don't panic.

14:25.692 --> 14:31.062
They can pick up
on that, too.

14:35.235 --> 14:37.499
Huh, I guess this must be

14:37.538 --> 14:41.235
some kind of rose-growing store
for kids.

14:41.275 --> 14:42.242
Excuse me, sir.

14:42.276 --> 14:44.710
I need to replace
this grow light.

14:44.745 --> 14:47.043
Is that so, officer?

14:47.081 --> 14:48.446
It's okay, guys.

14:48.482 --> 14:51.474
He's cool.

14:51.518 --> 14:54.351
Aw, come on, man, that lamp
is for high school kids.

14:54.388 --> 14:57.152
Step up to the Phototrons...
they rock.

14:57.191 --> 14:58.317
They'll force your buds

14:58.358 --> 15:01.020
increase your yield
and your potency.

15:01.061 --> 15:03.962
Just call me from outer space
and tell me it ain't true.

15:03.997 --> 15:07.489
Wow, how'd you like to see that
in our closet, Bobby?

15:07.534 --> 15:08.501
Would I?!

15:08.535 --> 15:11.527
We're going to grow
the best roses ever!

15:11.572 --> 15:13.972
Okay, this setup will
cost you about two grand.

15:14.007 --> 15:15.235
Two grand?

15:15.275 --> 15:16.242
You got a job, right?

15:16.276 --> 15:17.971
I have a great job.

15:18.011 --> 15:19.638
But still...

15:19.680 --> 15:21.307
Dang it.

15:21.348 --> 15:24.010
No wonder all those other
rose growers have sponsors.

15:24.051 --> 15:25.814
Hey, what would
you fellows say

15:25.853 --> 15:28.378
to sponsoring us
in our rose competition?

15:28.422 --> 15:30.890
Whoa, man, competition
ain't really our buzz.

15:30.924 --> 15:36.863
Lao Tzu says: "To be
better than someone is
to be worse than all."

15:36.897 --> 15:38.865
Wrap your mind
around that one, dude.

15:38.899 --> 15:40.867
Well, wrap your minds
around this:

15:40.901 --> 15:42.869
We'll wear Stems
'N Seeds T-shirts

15:42.903 --> 15:44.871
and you could put
the roses in those vases.

15:44.905 --> 15:45.872
(snickering)

15:45.906 --> 15:46.964
Come on, fellas

15:47.007 --> 15:48.304
this is important.

15:48.342 --> 15:49.775
You see, our great country...

15:49.810 --> 15:52.404
(voice echoing)
...positive values
like competition.

15:52.446 --> 15:53.913
The American way...

15:53.947 --> 15:55.414
...parts and minds...

15:55.449 --> 15:57.917
...Texas Propane
and Gas Association

15:57.951 --> 15:59.475
Commissioner Murray Hogarth.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.956
All if Stems 'N Seeds
would just sponsor us.

16:02.990 --> 16:05.550
What do you say, guys?

16:05.592 --> 16:07.753
We need more of this weed
and more of this dude.

16:07.794 --> 16:10.729
We'll do it.

16:13.133 --> 16:17.001
♪ I am your sunshine ♪

16:17.037 --> 16:19.471
♪ Your only sunshine ♪

16:19.506 --> 16:20.370
Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing?

16:20.407 --> 16:23.171
Sloppy side bud removal
requires penalization.

16:23.210 --> 16:28.807
Here, let me.

16:31.351 --> 16:33.012
All right, Bobby.

16:33.053 --> 16:34.452
Game day is tomorrow.

16:34.488 --> 16:36.012
You're in the single
vase category

16:36.056 --> 16:38.183
so you got to pick
one player to send in.

16:38.225 --> 16:39.419
This one's pretty.

16:39.459 --> 16:41.484
Not according to the book.

16:41.528 --> 16:44.361
If you go by the checklist,
this one's perfect.

16:44.398 --> 16:46.798
But I like how mine's
a little off center.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.301
It's got Wabi-Sabi.

16:49.336 --> 16:51.930
You can’t win an argument
by making up words.

16:51.972 --> 16:54.839
Wabi-Sabi is an Eastern
tradition, Dad.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.639
It's celebrating the beauty
in what's flawed...

16:57.678 --> 16:59.942
like the crack
in the Liberty Bell

16:59.980 --> 17:02.972
or the mole
on Cindy Crawford's face.

17:03.016 --> 17:04.449
The Liberty Bell is great

17:04.483 --> 17:06.452
but come on,
if it was in a contest

17:06.486 --> 17:09.079
with a bunch of bells without
cracks, it would lose.

17:09.122 --> 17:11.646
But sometimes
it's the small imperfections

17:11.692 --> 17:13.717
that make you love something
even more.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.719
So what if this rose is a little
too short and a little too wide.

17:17.763 --> 17:21.358
It's got more personality
than those other ones.

17:21.435 --> 17:24.131
Uh-huh.
But we're out to win.

17:35.782 --> 17:37.613
Ah, Morgan, my former student.

17:37.651 --> 17:40.085
Your flower looks like an anus
with a stem.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.088
What do you call it?

17:42.122 --> 17:43.453
Hello, Monroe.

17:43.490 --> 17:46.584
I crossed an Oakington Ruby
with a Dainty Bess.

17:46.627 --> 17:49.596
I call it a Ruby My Dear,
but I might as well call it

17:49.630 --> 17:52.565
"sending you home
crying to your mama."

17:52.599 --> 17:54.066
(chuckles)

17:54.101 --> 17:55.068
Yes!

17:55.102 --> 18:01.063
Dude, all these roses

18:03.377 --> 18:07.040
remind me of my mom's tattoo,
but they don't smell like arm.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.049
You'd better let
me do that, son.

18:12.586 --> 18:14.850
Nice, dude, nice.

18:14.888 --> 18:18.346
Okay. I'm just going to give it
a final mist so it'll look

18:18.392 --> 18:21.623
like morning dew is dripping off
its velvet petals.

18:21.662 --> 18:23.653
I must say...

18:23.697 --> 18:25.665
nicely spiraled center.

18:25.699 --> 18:26.893
Hmm, good work, kid.

18:26.933 --> 18:28.730
You hear that, Bobby?

18:28.769 --> 18:30.293
You could win this thing.

18:30.337 --> 18:32.498
Dude, that million
dollars is ours.

18:32.539 --> 18:34.336
There's no cash prize.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.501
It’s just for
honor, dude.

18:36.543 --> 18:39.979
Dude, that honor
is ours.

18:40.013 --> 18:42.709
Dad, why don’t we turn it
a little to the side

18:42.749 --> 18:46.515
so this leaf looks like
it's waving to the judge.

18:46.553 --> 18:49.283
Well, all the pictures in the
book are from this angle.

18:49.323 --> 18:52.087
But if it's turned away just
a little, it's more coy

18:52.125 --> 18:55.526
like, "Have we been properly
introduced?"

18:55.562 --> 18:57.393
Here, like this.

18:57.431 --> 18:58.398
Hands off!

18:58.432 --> 18:59.399
You're queering the spiral.

18:59.433 --> 19:01.697
Come on, it's my!

19:01.735 --> 19:03.965
(gasps)

19:04.004 --> 19:06.234
(all gasping)

19:06.273 --> 19:07.900
Oh, dang it, Bobby!

19:07.941 --> 19:09.602
It's bruised.

19:09.643 --> 19:11.611
Oh, you tweaked
our rose!

19:11.645 --> 19:17.140
Oh, god, I'm going to have
to remove interior petals.

19:17.184 --> 19:29.619
Get me my deckle-edged shears
and my stamp tongs.

19:29.663 --> 19:31.528
Shears down.

19:31.565 --> 19:32.827
Nice stature.

19:32.866 --> 19:36.165
Quite voluptuous
for a floribunda.

19:36.203 --> 19:39.730
Arrow-straight stem,
fine balance and proportion.

19:39.773 --> 19:41.707
What is that?

19:41.742 --> 19:42.709
That?

19:42.743 --> 19:44.040
That's nothing.

19:44.077 --> 19:45.544
You pulled a petal, didn’t you?

19:45.579 --> 19:47.774
You pulled
an interior petal.

19:47.814 --> 19:48.781
Uh... yes.

19:48.815 --> 19:49.782
Mm...

19:49.816 --> 19:51.340
That's too bad.

19:51.385 --> 19:53.353
Otherwise the rose
is truly flawless.

19:53.387 --> 19:54.649
No, no, wait.

19:54.688 --> 19:59.057
Uh... haven't you ever heard
of that oriental deal that says

19:59.092 --> 20:01.560
that something can be wrong
with something

20:01.595 --> 20:03.495
but it just makes
it better?

20:03.530 --> 20:05.122
Yeah, dude, Wabi-Sabi.

20:05.165 --> 20:06.393
Right. That.

20:06.433 --> 20:08.833
It's like that model with
the wart on her face.

20:08.869 --> 20:09.836
Isn't she pretty?

20:09.870 --> 20:12.839
Mm...

20:13.774 --> 20:16.766
Sorry, it's flawed. You lose.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.072
You're a loser.

20:18.111 --> 20:21.877
Which means I'm a loser,
which means my dad was right.

20:21.915 --> 20:23.212
You blew it, man!

20:23.250 --> 20:25.684
Oh, I wish I had
my Tibetan prayer beads.

20:25.719 --> 20:27.311
I'd hog-tie you
and leave you to rot.

20:27.354 --> 20:30.414
But what about Lao Tzu?

20:30.457 --> 20:35.019
Lao Tzu lived in a hut
and ate straw.

20:39.666 --> 20:41.463
And Queen of Show to...

20:41.501 --> 20:45.335
Ruby My Dear.

20:51.378 --> 20:53.778
Dad, no!

20:53.814 --> 20:56.146
Don't bury my roses!

20:56.183 --> 20:58.174
It was my fault,
not theirs.

20:58.218 --> 21:00.015
I'm planting
them, Bobby.

21:00.053 --> 21:02.351
But I didn’t win.

21:02.389 --> 21:03.356
Well, that's okay.

21:03.390 --> 21:06.985
The Cowboys don't win every
year, but I'm still a big fan

21:07.027 --> 21:09.552
and they have gun
and drug problems.

21:09.596 --> 21:10.893
I was thinking about it

21:10.931 --> 21:13.229
and my singing didn't really
help the roses.

21:13.266 --> 21:15.564
My voice just isn't that good.

21:15.602 --> 21:16.694
But check this out.

21:16.736 --> 21:19.671
(playing world music)

21:19.706 --> 21:20.968
Uh... son?

21:21.007 --> 21:22.941
Yeah, Dad?

21:22.976 --> 21:24.273
(sighs)

21:24.311 --> 21:26.643
You've got a lot
of Wabi-Sabi.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.672
(chuckles)
