00:01.502 --> 00:03.420
-[Umma] No.

00:03.462 --> 00:06.047
So, I said,

Oh, excuse me.

05:51.434 --> 05:55.396
I love watching people

05:51.434 --> 05:55.396
fish endlessly for that

05:51.434 --> 05:55.396
elusive morsel of chicken.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.398
I just need someone to sign.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
Yeah, I sign.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
Thank you.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.986
[Mr. Mehta] They literally

05:59.442 --> 06:00.986
spend ten minutes

06:01.028 --> 06:04.156
fishing, dipping...

06:01.028 --> 06:04.156
I want to scream,

06:01.028 --> 06:04.156
"It's just not there."

06:04.198 --> 06:06.992
Umma, I have a whole plan.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.076
Have you seen his flyer?

06:08.118 --> 06:09.786
Parts of it

06:08.118 --> 06:09.786
are very convincing.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.413
But I just buy

06:09.828 --> 06:12.413
this one and it's here.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.250
But I can get one

06:12.455 --> 06:15.250
for cheaper, huh?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.544
Save $200.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.839
Hmm, buy you nice dress,

06:17.585 --> 06:20.839
fancy shoes

06:20.881 --> 06:22.757
or just save $200!

06:24.467 --> 06:29.388
Fine, but I want new,

06:24.467 --> 06:29.388
working dishwasher

06:24.467 --> 06:29.388
this week, promise?

06:29.931 --> 06:31.390
I promise.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.437
Like the promise

06:33.476 --> 06:36.437
of a meat-filled curry

06:33.476 --> 06:36.437
for $3.99.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.190
It's just not possible.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.570
[Ms. Murray]

06:42.485 --> 06:43.570
Branding is everything.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.531
Let's take a look

06:43.611 --> 06:46.531
at Dree's website.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.116
Boldly original,

06:48.158 --> 06:51.036
a true reflection

06:48.158 --> 06:51.036
of the artist.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.164
[whispering] I bet

06:51.078 --> 06:54.164
she paid someone

06:51.078 --> 06:54.164
a lot of money to make that

06:54.206 --> 06:56.833
It's, uh, already paid for

06:54.206 --> 06:56.833
from the work I've gotten.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.877
So great.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.380
[Ms. Murray] Let's take a look

06:58.919 --> 07:01.380
at another website.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.465
-Oh, you can look at mine.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.465
-Great.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.719
Janet Kim, photography.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.473
Oh, Janet,

07:09.512 --> 07:12.473
this is beautiful.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.268
That's not mine.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.810
Well, kudos

07:14.309 --> 07:15.810
to this Janet Kim.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.605
Just go back to the searches,

07:15.852 --> 07:18.605
it should be the next one.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.442
Janet Kim Cam,

07:20.523 --> 07:22.442
that's cute.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.485
-Also not me.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.485
-It's a common name.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.030
There it is,

07:24.527 --> 07:27.030
photography by Janet Kim.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.448
Nope, can you try

07:27.072 --> 07:28.448
the next page.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.119
This is a good lesson

07:30.158 --> 07:32.119
in accessibility.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.246
If I had any interest

07:32.160 --> 07:34.246
in Janet's work,

07:34.288 --> 07:35.997
I would have lost it

07:34.288 --> 07:35.997
by now.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.420
-Wow, what a beaut!

07:38.541 --> 07:41.420
-[Appa] Yeah.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.923
And for $200

07:41.461 --> 07:44.923
less than this one.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.008
So you swindle

07:44.965 --> 07:47.008
an honest appliance store.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.677
No, I trick them

07:47.050 --> 07:49.677
into price match.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.972
Their policy,

07:49.719 --> 07:51.972
their problem.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.974
Hi, Frank,

07:52.013 --> 07:53.974
what's happening?

07:54.015 --> 07:56.393
-Fraud mostly.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.393
-No.

07:56.435 --> 07:59.938
I get the same dishwasher

07:56.435 --> 07:59.938
for so much less.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.522
-Price match.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.522
-Good.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.318
So, now,

08:01.564 --> 08:04.318
Frank stole my cheap one

08:04.359 --> 08:06.194
and I return

08:04.359 --> 08:06.194
the overpriced one.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.654
Okay.

08:07.695 --> 08:11.491
Uh, I think you mean,

08:07.695 --> 08:11.491
"Thank you,

08:07.695 --> 08:11.491
my handsome husband.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.826
You're just so very smart

08:12.867 --> 08:14.995
and save us

08:12.867 --> 08:14.995
so much money."

08:15.036 --> 08:17.122
I thank you

08:15.036 --> 08:17.122
when the dishwasher

08:15.036 --> 08:17.122
is working.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.540
-It's going

08:17.164 --> 08:19.540
to be working soon.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.540
-Then I thank you soon.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.461
-And the kitchen is...

08:19.582 --> 08:22.461
-Upstairs.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.545
Oh, dear. I charge

08:22.502 --> 08:24.545
$8 a stair,

08:24.587 --> 08:26.923
unless it's a 10-inch stair,

08:24.587 --> 08:26.923
then that's $8.50.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.343
And if there's a ladder,

08:26.965 --> 08:29.343
it's 10 bucks a round.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.551
No ladder.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.679
Still, gonna need

08:30.593 --> 08:32.679
my back girdle.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.516
And, uh, somewhere to change.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.235
Can I help you?

08:47.277 --> 08:49.570
No, I'm just here

08:47.277 --> 08:49.570
to see Kimchee.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.571
I used to work here.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.615
Well, not here

08:50.613 --> 08:52.615
but the old location.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.326
Okay.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.619
Dude! You made it!

08:54.368 --> 08:56.619
Let me get my jacket

08:54.368 --> 08:56.619
and we can jet.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.913
Yeah, totally.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.749
...I thought I lost

08:58.955 --> 09:01.749
my mind. [laughs]

09:02.834 --> 09:04.336
Long story short, Omar,

09:04.378 --> 09:06.171
I and the woman

09:04.378 --> 09:06.171
whose phone you found

09:06.213 --> 09:09.090
both think

09:06.213 --> 09:09.090
you are "Omar-zing."

09:09.132 --> 09:11.176
-[both laugh]

09:09.132 --> 09:11.176
-Well, happy to help.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.011
I came up with

09:11.218 --> 09:13.011
"Omar-zing" by the way.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.429
Yeah, I figured.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.975
-Hey.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.975
-Hey!

09:19.017 --> 09:21.144
Hope you're not here

09:19.017 --> 09:21.144
to spy on us.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.272
"Alert, hide your secrets.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.272
Competitor in the building."

09:24.314 --> 09:25.815
I'm just here

09:24.314 --> 09:25.815
to grab some lunch.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.527
Oh, I don't know

09:25.857 --> 09:28.527
if that's a great idea--

09:28.568 --> 09:31.446
-With Kimchee.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.446
-Oh, right. Good.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.033
So, how are things

09:32.655 --> 09:35.033
with, uh...

09:35.075 --> 09:38.912
-Alejandro? Good, yeah.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.912
-I was talking about your cats.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.955
Oh, they're great.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.625
Crazy as always,

09:40.997 --> 09:44.625
and don't let them

09:40.997 --> 09:44.625
near the tuna water.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.586
Cool.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.882
Grand.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.510
Oh, here's something.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.803
There's this guy

09:53.552 --> 09:55.803
at Comfy Car Rental, Dave.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.639
Nice guy,

09:55.845 --> 09:58.639
but he's looking

09:55.845 --> 09:58.639
for a change.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.017
-Okay.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.017
-Yeah, he's, uh...

10:01.059 --> 10:03.686
He's smart,

10:01.059 --> 10:03.686
pretty good-looking,

10:01.059 --> 10:03.686
takes care of himself,

10:03.728 --> 10:05.688
but he just doesn't

10:03.728 --> 10:05.688
really fit in over there.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.898
Oh, like a Terence.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.402
No! I mean... no.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.488
Um, anyway, he's made

10:10.444 --> 10:13.488
some mistakes

10:13.530 --> 10:15.449
but he's looking

10:13.530 --> 10:15.449
to start fresh,

10:15.490 --> 10:17.658
if that's something

10:15.490 --> 10:17.658
you're open to?

10:17.700 --> 10:21.788
Well, we're kind of

10:17.700 --> 10:21.788
fully staffed right now

10:17.700 --> 10:21.788
since the merge, but...

10:21.829 --> 10:25.333
forward me his resume

10:21.829 --> 10:25.333
and I will definitely

10:21.829 --> 10:25.333
think about it.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.793
Great, I love that.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.002
That for Dave.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.631
[camera shutter clicks]

10:33.800 --> 10:34.842
[Appa sighs]

10:36.177 --> 10:37.678
Oh, look good.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.722
Maybe one day

10:37.720 --> 10:39.722
could be you.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.682
Then that day is today.

10:41.724 --> 10:42.767
What you talking?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.520
This website is belong

10:42.809 --> 10:45.520
to Kim Eiu Kyung.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.938
Yeah, me.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.441
You are Kim "Janet."

10:49.483 --> 10:50.691
That's my English name.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.111
This is my new

10:50.733 --> 10:53.111
unique Korean name.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.821
It means justice treasure.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.656
-Who gave to you this name?

10:54.862 --> 10:56.656
-I did.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.992
I needed to stand out

10:59.033 --> 11:02.703
'cause my parents gave me

10:59.033 --> 11:02.703
a super boring English name.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.706
Don't blame me.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.706
I wanted to call you Hae Sun,

11:05.748 --> 11:08.084
but big fight with Umma.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.295
She wanted

11:08.126 --> 11:10.295
to call you "Su-Young."

11:10.337 --> 11:12.422
So much yelling,

11:10.337 --> 11:12.422
couldn't agree.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.048
So you settled on Janet?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.926
Just to be safe

11:14.090 --> 11:16.926
for we not give you a name

11:14.090 --> 11:16.926
people make fun of.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.720
"Dumb dumb Jung,

11:16.968 --> 11:19.720
"Ping Pong Jung

11:19.762 --> 11:21.556
Donkey Kong Jung."

11:21.598 --> 11:23.391
We tease him so much.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.391
[blows raspberry]

11:23.433 --> 11:26.478
Well, now I'm Eiu Kyung,

11:23.433 --> 11:26.478
so, tease away.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.563
-Eiu Kyung.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.563
-Yeah, Eiu Kyung.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.939
-Eiu.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.359
Eiu! Sound like

11:29.981 --> 11:32.359
you're Jewish.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.734
Or creative.

11:33.776 --> 11:37.280
Anyway, my professional name

11:33.776 --> 11:37.280
is now, Eiu Kyung.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.739
Eiu Kyung?

11:38.781 --> 11:41.075
Yeah! Her! Me! Us!

11:41.117 --> 11:43.744
Yeah, okay, I go

11:41.117 --> 11:43.744
to return dishwasher.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.745
-[grunts]

11:43.786 --> 11:44.745
-But you just bought it.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.788
Don't ask

11:44.787 --> 11:45.788
so many questions.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.790
-How was that a question?

11:45.830 --> 11:47.790
-See? Like that.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.709
-Oi!

11:48.749 --> 11:50.709
-Yeah?

11:57.758 --> 11:59.344
[cell phone vibrating]

12:07.810 --> 12:08.769
Hey!

12:08.811 --> 12:10.813
Hi-ya! Is this

12:08.811 --> 12:10.813
a good time?

12:10.855 --> 12:12.773
It's Shannon, by the way.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.067
Yeah, hey, what's up?

12:14.108 --> 12:18.363
Well, I've been

12:14.108 --> 12:18.363
thinking about... Dave.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.824
-Really?

12:18.405 --> 12:21.824
<i>-Yeah, and we are</i>

12:18.405 --> 12:21.824
<i>swamp city over here,</i>

12:21.866 --> 12:24.494
and you're right.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.494
People deserve

12:21.866 --> 12:24.494
a second chance.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.953
Absolutely.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.789
<i>So, theoretically,</i>

12:25.995 --> 12:28.789
<i>when do you think</i>

12:25.995 --> 12:28.789
<i>Dave can start?</i>

12:28.831 --> 12:30.417
[exhales heavily]

12:28.831 --> 12:30.417
Right away.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.793
Great! Then why don't you

12:30.458 --> 12:32.793
tell him to come on in

12:30.458 --> 12:32.793
for a meeting,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.379
and we'll see

12:32.835 --> 12:34.379
what we can do.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.339
-Sure thing.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.339
<i>-Ah, but he should know</i>

12:36.381 --> 12:38.757
we're going to give him

12:36.381 --> 12:38.757
a bit of a ribbing

12:38.799 --> 12:40.385
for working

12:38.799 --> 12:40.385
for the competition.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.429
<i>Yeah, I get that,</i>

12:40.427 --> 12:42.429
<i>he probably deserves it.</i>

12:42.470 --> 12:44.805
Thank, Shannon. Bye.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.184
Yes!

12:50.395 --> 12:51.563
Next!

12:54.857 --> 12:57.569
Hi. My name is Mr. Kim.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.821
I come from South Korea

12:57.611 --> 13:00.821
to Canada a long time ago.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.408
My wife and me,

13:00.863 --> 13:03.408
we just struggle everyday--

13:03.450 --> 13:05.159
-You wanna return this?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.159
-Yeah.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.036
Okay.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.787
Can you just

13:07.078 --> 13:08.787
open that for me, please.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.292
[beeps]

13:12.333 --> 13:15.169
Oh, serial number

13:12.333 --> 13:15.169
is not coming up.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.837
Are you sure

13:15.211 --> 13:16.837
you bought it here?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.715
Yeah, my wife

13:16.879 --> 13:18.715
buy from here.

13:18.757 --> 13:19.840
Well, according

13:18.757 --> 13:19.840
to our records,

13:19.882 --> 13:21.593
we never

13:19.882 --> 13:21.593
stocked this unit.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.595
So, I'm afraid

13:21.635 --> 13:23.595
we can't take it back.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.846
What?

13:25.888 --> 13:29.183
This dishwasher

13:25.888 --> 13:29.183
was not bought

13:25.888 --> 13:29.183
at this store.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.603
Sorry. Next!

13:35.106 --> 13:36.190
Hey, Stacie.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.858
Can you call

13:36.232 --> 13:37.858
the Parkdale branch

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
and have them send over

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
as many mid-sized sedans

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
as they can spare.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.862
-Do you want me

13:39.902 --> 13:41.862
to do that right now?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.862
-Yes, now.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.741
We are giving away

13:41.904 --> 13:44.741
full sized sedans

13:41.904 --> 13:44.741
at mid-size prices.

13:44.783 --> 13:45.866
It is a bloodbath.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.661
[Jung] Hey Shannon.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.121
New guy's here.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.121
Ready to crack some skulls.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.872
Great, where's Dave?

13:51.914 --> 13:53.832
[Jung] Where is he, indeed.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.671
Reporting for duty,

13:56.127 --> 13:57.671
Captain.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.880
What?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.467
-I'm Dave.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.467
-How are you Dave?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.885
-We were talking in code.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.885
-What code?

14:04.927 --> 14:06.887
The one where

14:04.927 --> 14:06.887
Dave meant me.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.887
I thought you got that.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.556
I did not get that.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.433
Oh!

14:10.475 --> 14:12.393
Can I talk to you

14:10.475 --> 14:12.393
in my office, please?

14:12.435 --> 14:15.271
-Should I come? Can I come?

14:12.435 --> 14:15.271
-No! Call the other branch.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
Here you go,

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
clean snack.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.903
-No egg on fork.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.903
-Oh, yeah.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.905
See? Everything work out.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.908
Frank even give us

14:24.947 --> 14:27.908
a discount on the last

14:24.947 --> 14:27.908
four steps

14:27.950 --> 14:29.410
because he tripped.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.495
Oh, where you going?

14:30.537 --> 14:31.912
Just a couple

14:30.537 --> 14:31.912
of things to do.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.665
Also, sneak attack Janet.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.250
Maybe today is the day

14:33.707 --> 14:36.250
I catch her doing

14:33.707 --> 14:36.250
something very bad.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.752
Okay, have fun.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.045
And take your time.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.893
[grunting]

14:57.188 --> 14:58.857
[sighs]

14:58.898 --> 15:00.941
It's kinda funny.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.237
It's not funny.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.237
They never hired you

15:00.983 --> 15:04.237
so you've been...

15:04.278 --> 15:07.323
Working from home.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.323
Well, not my home,

15:04.278 --> 15:07.323
my sister's home.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.658
Keepin' the muscles loose.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.451
There's no TV,

15:08.700 --> 15:10.451
so you can get

15:08.700 --> 15:10.451
a lot done.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.871
I thought you didn't

15:10.493 --> 15:12.871
want to work here

15:10.493 --> 15:12.871
because there was no room

15:12.912 --> 15:15.749
for the... advancement

15:12.912 --> 15:15.749
you were looking for,

15:15.790 --> 15:17.876
-which hasn't changed.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.876
-I know.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.921
And I'm not looking

15:17.917 --> 15:21.921
for advancement now.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.340
I'm looking for work.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.469
Okay.

15:28.511 --> 15:32.682
I see how maybe I gave you

15:28.511 --> 15:32.682
the idea that there could be

15:28.511 --> 15:32.682
some... advancement,

15:32.724 --> 15:37.854
and maybe I liked

15:32.724 --> 15:37.854
that you showed interest

15:32.724 --> 15:37.854
in filling that position.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.398
So, if by position

15:38.813 --> 15:40.398
you mean--

15:40.440 --> 15:42.108
Oh, I don't.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.108
No more kissing the boss.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.317
Right. Right.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.736
And if you can

15:43.359 --> 15:44.736
live with that,

15:44.778 --> 15:46.613
then maybe

15:44.778 --> 15:46.613
there is a position

15:44.778 --> 15:46.613
that would be good

15:46.654 --> 15:49.990
for the both of us.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.990
Uh... job position.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.744
[sighs]

15:52.786 --> 15:55.955
Thank you.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.955
That would be "Ama-zing."

15:57.164 --> 15:59.959
[cell phone vibrates]

16:00.000 --> 16:02.044
-That's weird.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.044
-Hope it's not a better offer.

16:02.754 --> 16:03.963
It's my dad.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.228
[Janet] Should you

16:17.310 --> 16:19.228
be eating those?

16:19.270 --> 16:21.105
It's just so good.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.650
-Ciao, Dree.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.650
-Bye.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.026
Oh, and this is

16:23.691 --> 16:26.026
Gerald Tremblay.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.196
And... [whispers]

16:26.068 --> 16:29.196
Janet, I think you're

16:26.068 --> 16:29.196
at the wrong booth.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.198
No, just a bit

16:29.238 --> 16:31.198
of re-branding.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.034
I'm Eiu Kyung.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.034
It's my Korean name.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.370
-It means buried treasure.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.370
-Justice treasure.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.123
You can see

16:36.412 --> 16:39.123
the full collection

16:36.412 --> 16:39.123
on my website.

16:39.165 --> 16:42.042
Very cool, Eiu Kyung.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.670
Yeah, this looks great, Eiu.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.005
It's pronounced

16:43.711 --> 16:46.005
Eiu with an "o."

16:46.631 --> 16:48.257
It's spelt like this.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.551
Oh!

16:50.593 --> 16:53.554
But it's pronounced Eiu.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.056
No, I mean,

16:53.596 --> 16:56.056
"Oh, the card is different

16:53.596 --> 16:56.056
from the poster."

16:56.098 --> 16:58.058
And they're

16:56.098 --> 16:58.058
both different

16:56.098 --> 16:58.058
than the website.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.226
[chuckles awkwardly]

17:00.186 --> 17:02.605
The website

17:00.186 --> 17:02.605
is the right one.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.190
Such a unique name!

17:04.231 --> 17:06.651
And... so hard to remember.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.864
-Are those cookies?

17:08.277 --> 17:10.864
-Yes, but they're mine.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.873
-Appa.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.873
-Huh?

17:19.914 --> 17:22.834
-Jung.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.834
-I, uh, got your text.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.711
-Obviously.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.711
-Good.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.086
I have a job for you.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.881
Look, I don't know

17:26.128 --> 17:27.881
what Janet told you

17:27.922 --> 17:29.883
but it was just

17:27.922 --> 17:29.883
a little blip, okay?

17:29.924 --> 17:31.634
I got my job back.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.634
Things are good.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.845
-You lose your job?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.845
-No!

17:33.887 --> 17:36.472
Working at Handy... still.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.058
-Why did you text me?

17:36.514 --> 17:39.058
-Have a surprise for Umma.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.062
Am I coming with you?

17:51.946 --> 17:53.072
[Umma] Hi, Janet.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.324
Umma, what are you

17:54.156 --> 17:55.324
doing here?

17:55.366 --> 17:56.743
What is this white powder?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.912
It's sweetener

17:56.784 --> 17:58.912
from Bulk Boutique.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.121
Oh. Have a nice day.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.374
-Can you please call

18:01.163 --> 18:03.374
before you come over?

18:01.163 --> 18:03.374
-No.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.126
Eiu Kyung.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.713
-Her work is not very good.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.713
-They're mine.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.339
Then why is it Eiu Kyung?

18:10.381 --> 18:13.384
Because there's a million

18:10.381 --> 18:13.384
"Janet Kims" out there.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.053
My name sucks.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.471
What are you talking?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.471
Janet is a beautiful name.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.932
I choose.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.141
Well, I wish you chose

18:18.973 --> 18:21.141
something more interesting.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.645
Janet... we choose

18:21.183 --> 18:24.645
your name for special reason.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.315
When we first starting store,

18:28.357 --> 18:30.526
there was old lady,

18:28.357 --> 18:30.526
regular customer.

18:30.568 --> 18:35.031
She help me with English,

18:30.568 --> 18:35.031
babysit Jung and always

18:30.568 --> 18:35.031
bring banana bread.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.365
Maybe too much.

18:36.407 --> 18:37.700
And I always think,

18:37.742 --> 18:42.162
"Oh, she is an angel

18:37.742 --> 18:42.162
God sent to us, to help."

18:42.204 --> 18:44.123
And that's why

18:42.204 --> 18:44.123
we name you Janet.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.459
So, was her name Janet?

18:46.500 --> 18:49.169
-Yeah. I didn't say that?

18:46.500 --> 18:49.169
-No.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.588
Oh, her name,

18:49.211 --> 18:50.588
it was Janet

18:50.630 --> 18:52.506
and that's why

18:50.630 --> 18:52.506
we name you Janet.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.467
That's kinda sweet.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.177
-Thanks, Umma.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.177
-Aw.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.139
Yeah, she was

18:57.219 --> 19:00.139
very kind lady,

19:00.180 --> 19:03.101
and her kind spirit

19:00.180 --> 19:03.101
live in you.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.687
-She died?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.687
-Yeah. I didn't say that?

19:06.729 --> 19:08.230
-No.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.230
-Aw, yeah.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.900
Still, very nice story.

19:10.942 --> 19:14.194
All right,

19:10.942 --> 19:14.194
all right, all right.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.196
Watch finger.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.196
Watch finger!

19:16.238 --> 19:17.949
Ah!

19:17.991 --> 19:20.159
Okay. Good. Good.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.244
Okay, so now we just...

19:22.286 --> 19:24.122
Wait, is that

19:22.286 --> 19:24.122
the same dishwasher?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.206
Okay, what happened is

19:26.248 --> 19:28.208
Umma buy that one. Hmm.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.962
But I make a fake ad

19:28.250 --> 19:30.962
for doing price match.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.839
And it work.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.839
Can you believe?

19:32.880 --> 19:35.215
But then Frank,

19:32.880 --> 19:35.215
he made a big mix-up.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.593
And I take wrong one

19:35.257 --> 19:37.593
to right store.

19:37.635 --> 19:42.056
They check serial number

19:37.635 --> 19:42.056
on the door but it's not

19:37.635 --> 19:42.056
from that store.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.642
So, now we take

19:42.098 --> 19:44.642
this dishwasher out,

19:44.684 --> 19:46.226
put this one in,

19:46.268 --> 19:47.895
take the right one

19:46.268 --> 19:47.895
back to store.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.439
They scan,

19:47.937 --> 19:50.439
full refund.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.439
Genius.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.900
Okay.

19:52.942 --> 19:56.070
Or we could just switch

19:52.942 --> 19:56.070
the dishwasher doors.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.905
Then you still get

19:56.112 --> 19:57.905
a full refund.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.240
Mmm, yeah.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.035
That's a good idea, too.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.203
All right, let's get

20:02.076 --> 20:04.203
to work.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.550
-What you doing?

20:15.422 --> 20:17.550
-Oh!

20:17.591 --> 20:18.801
You back already.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.260
Why is there two dishwasher

20:20.302 --> 20:21.971
and their both doors

20:20.302 --> 20:21.971
broken off?

20:22.013 --> 20:24.306
That would be my idea.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.306
Found it.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.432
-Jung?

20:24.348 --> 20:25.432
-[Appa] Yeah.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.018
He is helping me.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.268
Yeah, Appa wanted

20:27.060 --> 20:28.268
to surprise you

20:28.310 --> 20:29.603
by installing

20:28.310 --> 20:29.603
the cheaper dishwasher.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.271
And Jung come over

20:29.645 --> 20:31.271
and help move.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.439
Yeah, Appa did

20:31.313 --> 20:32.439
most of the lifting.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.234
But then Jung come up

20:32.481 --> 20:35.234
with the best idea.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.904
Switch the doors

20:35.275 --> 20:37.904
so you can return

20:35.275 --> 20:37.904
the more expensive one.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.030
That's where

20:37.945 --> 20:39.030
the barcode is.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.698
But before we know,

20:40.740 --> 20:42.992
so many wires

20:40.740 --> 20:42.992
all over and, uh...

20:43.034 --> 20:45.327
who would've thought

20:43.034 --> 20:45.327
the door was the brains

20:43.034 --> 20:45.327
of the operation.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.667
So, both dishwasher

20:47.496 --> 20:51.667
is broken now?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.462
But we are

20:53.669 --> 20:55.462
working together,

20:55.504 --> 20:57.048
father and the son.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.092
Mmm.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.012
Are those happy tears

21:00.259 --> 21:03.012
or sad tears?

21:03.054 --> 21:05.305
[sobbing] I don't know.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.225
I want our family together...

21:08.851 --> 21:11.771
but I also want

21:08.851 --> 21:11.771
a working dishwasher.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.358
But if you

21:14.523 --> 21:16.358
have to choose...

21:18.402 --> 21:21.321
[Umma] Oh! Oh!

21:21.363 --> 21:23.323
