[Hank sighs deeply]

00:40.858 --> 00:42.120
Bobby.

00:42.660 --> 00:43.854
Bobby.

00:45.029 --> 00:46.121
[Peggy shushing]

00:46.230 --> 00:49.393
Bobby is in, what I hope,
is not his deathbed.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.936
BOBBY: More juice, crazier straw.
PEGGY: Roger that.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.131
[Coughing]

01:09.487 --> 01:10.852
Hey, Son, are you sick?

01:10.955 --> 01:15.187
Don't kiss me, Dad. I could be contagious.

01:23.467 --> 01:27.233
- Looks normal.
- Put that on my headstone, will you?

01:32.243 --> 01:35.178
You know, it frightens me to think that
we raised Bobby for 12 years...

01:35.279 --> 01:36.371
without the Internet.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.347
Parents without the Internet
should have their children taken away.

01:39.450 --> 01:40.474
What's it say?

01:40.584 --> 01:45.351
He has cedar fever, or a sinus infection,
or he may be allergic to something else.

01:45.456 --> 01:46.548
I do not know.

01:46.657 --> 01:48.022
We have to take him to the doctor.

01:48.125 --> 01:51.754
How do you know it isn't just
a runny nose? His temperature's normal.

01:51.862 --> 01:56.424
You know, when I was his age, I painted
the living room with a separated shoulder.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.094
I am searching the Web as fast as I can.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.434
Apparently, there is a local rock band
named Cedar Fever...

02:02.540 --> 02:04.201
and it's complicating my research.

02:05.910 --> 02:07.070
[Telephone ringing]

02:07.878 --> 02:09.937
Strickland Propane.
Taste the meat, not the...

02:10.047 --> 02:11.344
PEGGY: Okay. There's no time for that.

02:11.448 --> 02:13.848
Hank, I am over at the doctor's office
with Bobby.

02:13.951 --> 02:16.317
There is something
you will want to know right away.

02:16.420 --> 02:17.444
Is something wrong with...

02:17.555 --> 02:18.544
[Bobby screams]

02:18.656 --> 02:19.884
Get over here!

02:25.930 --> 02:27.591
Bobby, thank God! What happened?

02:27.698 --> 02:30.633
They were pricking my back with pins!

02:31.535 --> 02:33.867
You were getting an allergy test.

02:34.805 --> 02:36.705
You still want that Merlin tattoo?

02:36.807 --> 02:40.573
Hank, it's not good. And it's about Bobby.

02:45.649 --> 02:47.708
Bobby's having an allergic reaction
to dander.

02:47.818 --> 02:49.911
Your wife tells me you have a dog.

02:50.354 --> 02:52.322
Slow down there, Charlie.

02:52.456 --> 02:55.289
Now, what does a dog
have to do with anything?

02:55.392 --> 02:57.019
Bobby's allergic to the dog.

02:57.127 --> 03:00.927
You said "dander." How do you know
that Peggy doesn't have the dander?

03:02.833 --> 03:07.463
Well, you're in that school
with kids from all over. She got lice once.

03:07.571 --> 03:10.597
Hank, the test was specifically
for dog dander.

03:10.975 --> 03:13.967
And you once came home from Mexico
with a butt worm!

03:14.078 --> 03:18.777
Allergies can come and go suddenly
and mysteriously. It's a fascinating field.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.711
You could try bathing Ladybird
three times a week, then vacuuming her.

03:22.820 --> 03:24.515
I already do that.

03:24.622 --> 03:27.386
Hank, that dog is going out of the house.

03:27.491 --> 03:30.392
Look, if you want a dog inside,
it says right here...

03:30.494 --> 03:35.397
that there are several hypoallergenic
breeds of dog, such as poodles or hairless.

03:36.033 --> 03:37.022
A poodle?

03:37.134 --> 03:41.230
Why not go all the way and just get me
a cat and a sex change operation?

03:41.338 --> 03:43.465
Can't we just give Bobby something?

03:43.574 --> 03:46.702
You could give him daily shots.
But Bobby...

03:47.111 --> 03:49.306
We had enough trouble with the pinpricks.

03:49.413 --> 03:51.176
There are pills, but they don't often work.

03:51.281 --> 03:54.546
And their side effects include drowsiness,
hives and rectal bleeding.

03:54.652 --> 03:58.144
And most people find it much simpler
just to get rid of the dog.

03:58.255 --> 03:59.950
We'll try the pills.

04:01.425 --> 04:05.191
You just say the word
and Ladybird will die a mysterious death.

04:05.295 --> 04:09.163
I know several poisons
that have the meaty taste dogs love.

04:09.266 --> 04:11.826
You know, Hank, I could take in Ladybird.

04:11.935 --> 04:15.029
She sniffed me once
and did not look displeased.

04:15.139 --> 04:18.438
Thanks, Bill,
but Ladybird deserves better than that.

04:18.541 --> 04:19.839
Oh, I know.

04:19.942 --> 04:24.778
When I was growing up, we had a dog that
we kept outside in its own little house.

04:24.915 --> 04:27.281
Hank doesn't want your old dog!

04:27.384 --> 04:32.014
No. Bill's right.
I could build Ladybird a doghouse.

04:32.456 --> 04:34.549
I was gonna build her one
when she was a puppy.

04:34.658 --> 04:38.321
But then Bobby came along
and I got sidetracked making a crib.

04:38.796 --> 04:41.788
Maybe this is the second chance
I've been waiting for.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.443
Now, if you have any suggestions
for improvements...

04:58.549 --> 05:01.040
make them now before I file the permits.

05:01.151 --> 05:04.518
- It looks too small.
- It's a model, Dale.

05:04.655 --> 05:06.850
In that case, it's just right.

05:10.694 --> 05:13.026
PEGGY: Hank, Bobby's only breathing
through his mouth.

05:13.130 --> 05:14.757
I'm afraid to bring him lunch.

05:14.865 --> 05:16.264
Give Bobby some more pills.

05:16.366 --> 05:20.393
I still have to put in the baseboards
and bolt the walls to the foundation.

05:20.504 --> 05:21.528
Gee, Hank...

05:21.638 --> 05:24.072
I would love to give our son
another handful of pills...

05:24.174 --> 05:26.301
but he's been asleep for 18 hours.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.777
Look, I'm as concerned as you are, Peggy,
but I need more time.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.577
I can't have a dog in there
licking at exposed wiring.

05:37.721 --> 05:41.179
- The floor is warm.
- That's the radiant sub floor heating.

05:41.291 --> 05:45.227
You know, 80% of a dog's heat loss
is through its pads.

05:46.330 --> 05:49.026
Okay, that figure came
from the radiant-floor people...

05:49.133 --> 05:51.158
so it may be a little high.

05:51.568 --> 05:55.299
"Although we move you
into Barkingham Palace today...

05:55.839 --> 06:00.173
"we will always leave
a doggy door open into our hearts.

06:00.344 --> 06:04.974
"And we hope we have made your home
as wonderful as you have made ours...

06:05.082 --> 06:06.515
"these past 13 years."

06:06.617 --> 06:09.017
Okay, Luanne, the champagne.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.126
Forgive me.

06:26.170 --> 06:27.194
DALE: Push her in!

06:27.304 --> 06:30.068
We all came to see
the opening of a doghouse!

06:37.214 --> 06:38.647
This can't be easy.

06:38.749 --> 06:42.116
She's slept at the foot of our bed
for 13 years.

06:42.219 --> 06:45.552
- Don't blame Ladybird, blame me.
- Of course I blame you!

06:45.656 --> 06:50.355
I made the architect's first mistake.
I designed it for me, not the client.

06:50.894 --> 06:53.124
I can do this fast, I promise.

06:53.230 --> 06:57.530
Okay, grand reopening in 36 hours.
This time, no gifts.

06:58.202 --> 07:00.500
[Majestic band music playing]

07:00.671 --> 07:03.504
Bill! Not today! Abort!

07:05.976 --> 07:08.774
HANK: I've got the backscratcher
close to the food dispenser...

07:08.879 --> 07:12.645
in case Ladybird wants to scratch
and eat at the same time.

07:15.385 --> 07:18.718
Hank, I can give her a good home.

07:18.822 --> 07:21.120
Ladybird won't go in her doghouse.

07:21.225 --> 07:24.388
And her doghouse is already better
than your house.

07:37.241 --> 07:40.642
Maybe instead of three,
you could take six or seven.

07:40.744 --> 07:42.234
Whatever.

07:43.947 --> 07:47.508
They're not doing much for the dog hair,
but watch this.

07:53.757 --> 07:56.055
Bobby, that cannot be good for you.

07:56.159 --> 07:59.617
Hank, it is only fair to warn you
that tomorrow I am shaving the dog.

07:59.730 --> 08:03.632
She is going out in the morning.
Just give her one last night.

08:03.734 --> 08:06.498
You know, the allergies won't clear up
right away.

08:06.603 --> 08:08.935
Ladybird's dander is all over the house.

08:09.039 --> 08:13.203
We're gonna have to steam-clean
the furniture, probably replace the carpets.

08:13.310 --> 08:17.508
We'll have to wash, or dry-clean,
all of our clothes...

08:17.614 --> 08:19.445
then vacuum all over.

08:22.953 --> 08:25.387
You know,
Ladybird hasn't gone in the doghouse...

08:25.489 --> 08:27.582
so there's no dander in there.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.985
And the air filter would work better
in a small room.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.756
And for less than the cost
of cleaning the house...

08:33.864 --> 08:37.027
we could pay to have a second TV set
hooked up to the cable.

08:37.134 --> 08:39.534
Hank, the dog is not getting a television.

08:39.635 --> 08:41.126
No. Peggy, don't be silly.

08:41.238 --> 08:45.265
What I was thinking was,
Bobby could live in the doghouse.

08:46.543 --> 08:50.639
Yeah, that'll work. Bobby's only 13.
He's young. It'll be fun for him.

08:50.747 --> 08:54.683
But Ladybird's 13.
She doesn't have much time left...

08:54.785 --> 08:58.619
and she's set in her ways.
Yep, that works all around.

08:58.722 --> 09:02.590
Ladybird! Daddy's got your din-din!

09:06.463 --> 09:08.863
It'll be like Tom Sawyer, Bobby.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.730
But instead of a raft,
you'll have a doghouse.

09:11.835 --> 09:14.497
Okay, Bobby.
You've indulged your father long enough.

09:14.604 --> 09:16.469
Now, get out. Get...

09:17.207 --> 09:19.675
He's not getting out.
He must be stuck. Hank!

09:19.776 --> 09:20.936
I'll take it!

09:21.044 --> 09:23.569
Bobby, honey, I do not know
what your father told you...

09:23.680 --> 09:26.308
but he has to love you
whether you move in or not!

09:26.416 --> 09:29.385
Mom, this is a perfect starter home.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.783
I like the neighborhood...

09:30.887 --> 09:34.721
I won't have to change schools,
and it's Connie-adjacent.

09:35.092 --> 09:38.391
Bobby's a big boy, Peggy.
Can't hang on forever.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.292
Time to move on, Mom.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.092
[Peggy and Connie laughing]

09:44.634 --> 09:47.330
The courtesy of an invitation.
That's all I ask.

09:47.437 --> 09:49.803
Peggy, we couldn't even fit in the door.

09:52.776 --> 09:57.179
Tony's Pizza will do nicely
until Dad installs my kitchen grill.

09:57.447 --> 09:59.642
I stole a bottle of Chianti from my dad.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.742
I poured out the wine
so we can put a candle in it.

10:08.325 --> 10:11.886
- You can't beat that view of the alley.
- Yeah.

10:22.672 --> 10:24.469
MINH: Hey, Peggy Hill!

10:24.574 --> 10:26.804
Connie want to have
your Bobby over to play.

10:26.910 --> 10:28.639
You had him fixed, right?

10:29.513 --> 10:32.311
I'm glad you find my son's sickness
so amusing.

10:32.416 --> 10:36.250
If he were living in a plastic bubble,
I would be having lunch with Elton John.

10:36.353 --> 10:38.480
But because he is in a doghouse...

10:39.389 --> 10:40.447
Big laugh.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.958
You know what would be really funny?

10:45.028 --> 10:46.893
If Connie broke her leg!

10:55.405 --> 10:57.373
Oh, look. We got a letter from Bobby.

10:57.474 --> 11:01.001
Apparently, he can't make it to
the Gribbles' anniversary party. That's...

11:01.111 --> 11:03.011
Hank, people are starting to talk.

11:03.113 --> 11:06.605
Well, let them talk.
I say this is good for Bobby.

11:06.716 --> 11:10.675
He's learning a little bit about
the real world out there in the doghouse.

11:10.787 --> 11:14.279
And look at you
with the spiffiest new office in town.

11:14.391 --> 11:17.053
Yes. It is everything
I have always deserved.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.391
But I have turned our son into a stranger.

11:20.497 --> 11:22.590
I am moving back into the closet.

11:22.699 --> 11:25.361
Well, if that's what you think is best...

11:25.469 --> 11:28.302
I guess I'll set up Ladybird
in Bobby's room, then.

11:28.438 --> 11:32.966
Don't let Ladybird...
LB in the room until I'm finished.

11:33.076 --> 11:34.839
I want it to be a surprise.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.043
We got some of your mail here.

11:42.452 --> 11:46.855
Suddenly everybody wants to sell
Bobby Hill a security system.

11:47.190 --> 11:49.852
So, your mother was wanting to see you.

11:50.260 --> 11:52.888
How does dinner on Thursday sound?

11:52.996 --> 11:54.486
Thursday's poker night.

11:54.598 --> 11:56.725
The stripper comes over at 9:00.

11:57.534 --> 11:59.866
I'm just yanking your chain.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.597
She's over at 8:00.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.267
Little help?

12:10.981 --> 12:14.712
BOBBY: If I get one more Frisbee,
I'm opening a store.

12:21.558 --> 12:23.992
REPORTER: Mayor Bridgewater said
a financial feasibility study...

12:24.094 --> 12:26.289
You gonna hog all of that pillow?

12:27.964 --> 12:30.524
Bobby, it's covered with Ladybird's hair.

12:30.634 --> 12:33.535
Oh, thank God!
I thought I was losing mine.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.472
You're not sneezing
or hacking up something gross.

12:41.578 --> 12:43.068
Maybe it's the pills.

12:43.180 --> 12:46.274
I started taking two of the yellows
with half a red.

12:46.383 --> 12:50.376
My heart stopped beating funny
and I didn't cry as much at school.

12:50.654 --> 12:52.884
So, your allergies are under control?

12:53.823 --> 12:55.290
Yeah. How about that?

12:55.392 --> 12:59.089
But my dislike for local news continues.

12:59.663 --> 13:02.757
I guess that means
you'll be moving back into the house.

13:03.099 --> 13:05.363
I may be well, but I'm not stupid.

13:05.468 --> 13:08.767
I am not giving up this doghouse.
You got that?

13:09.673 --> 13:12.972
Connie, look at me. You got that?

13:14.811 --> 13:16.039
Say it.

13:16.279 --> 13:18.543
- I got that.
- Good.

13:18.648 --> 13:19.740
[Toaster clinks]

13:19.849 --> 13:22.317
That would be our toaster pastries.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.481
I own my own house.

13:29.059 --> 13:33.189
Hey, everybody, look what
the gun club made for our anniversary.

13:34.164 --> 13:38.430
After dessert, they're going to fire
15 bullets into our hearts...

13:38.535 --> 13:41.663
one for every year of conjugal bliss.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.463
[All exclaiming softly]

13:44.608 --> 13:47.941
Okay, now,
everyone get into single file for dessert.

[Rifle clicking]

13:49.779 --> 13:51.110
Single file.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.885
I'm sorry Bobby isn't here.

13:55.986 --> 13:57.920
I'm sure he would have loved the desserts.

13:58.021 --> 14:02.424
Say, what if I give you one to take home
for him in a doggy bag?

14:05.061 --> 14:08.030
My son does not eat leftovers.

14:08.131 --> 14:09.291
Oh, that's right.

14:09.399 --> 14:13.028
Once you get them on the table scraps,
they won't eat their kibble.

14:16.139 --> 14:17.504
Doghouse.

14:33.490 --> 14:35.822
Come on, Ladybird, don't make me beg.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.726
Please, Ladybird, be a good dog.

14:47.904 --> 14:51.237
It's my fault, Peggy.
I raised her in a real house.

14:53.043 --> 14:54.908
Well, I have no choice.

14:58.548 --> 15:00.880
You'll have to walk her
when it's time to go.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.283
- She won't go in her own yard.
- I'm the same way.

15:04.387 --> 15:06.719
Yeah, and when you change her water...

15:06.823 --> 15:10.623
mix in two tablespoons of red wine
for her heart.

15:11.094 --> 15:12.584
Let's be honest.

15:12.962 --> 15:16.022
Neither one of us is any good
at saying goodbyes.

15:17.133 --> 15:20.000
I'll, uh, see you when I see you.

15:26.343 --> 15:30.439
All right, get yourself washed up.
We don't eat with dirty fingernails.

15:30.547 --> 15:34.005
You go ahead without me.
I'm just gonna order a pizza.

15:34.117 --> 15:36.984
- We're having chicken and broccoli.
- Okay.

15:37.087 --> 15:39.920
You can have some of my pizza
if you want.

15:40.023 --> 15:43.220
The only pizza you'll be having
is chicken and broccoli pizza...

15:43.326 --> 15:45.726
without the crust and the pizza sauce.

15:45.829 --> 15:49.390
But plenty of cheese, because
that's the way your mother makes it.

15:59.909 --> 16:02.571
Delicious chicken and broccoli, Mother.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.805
No! I've been down this road...

16:09.686 --> 16:10.846
Before!

16:10.954 --> 16:13.889
Oh, my goodness!
Bobby, honey, are you okay?

16:15.158 --> 16:17.718
Has Ladybird been in the house?

16:17.827 --> 16:19.522
- Hank?
- No.

16:20.530 --> 16:24.057
Well, Bill brought her by the alley.
She gave me her paw. But...

16:24.667 --> 16:25.929
What am I supposed to do?

16:26.035 --> 16:28.560
Leave her hanging?
That would have been rude.

16:29.272 --> 16:30.330
Rude.

16:30.774 --> 16:33.436
Hank, you could have dragged dander
into this house.

16:33.543 --> 16:34.840
Don't panic.

16:34.944 --> 16:39.074
There's no need to send me
back out to the doghouse yet.

17:02.639 --> 17:04.903
Hello. This is Bobby Hill.

17:05.008 --> 17:07.909
I'd like to order a large pizza
with everything.

17:10.914 --> 17:12.108
Ladybird?

17:13.348 --> 17:16.647
I'm sorry,
but she won't go in her own yard.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.653
[Hank sniffs sadly]

17:26.429 --> 17:27.828
[Vacuum cleaner humming]

17:27.931 --> 17:32.095
Peggy, it's like I told you, the crawl space
under the house is spotless.

17:32.202 --> 17:36.696
I shouldn't have cleaned this book first.
It's too engaging. I can't put it down.

17:39.909 --> 17:41.570
Peggy, there's nothing in here.

17:41.678 --> 17:44.146
We've already gone
through the house twice.

17:47.383 --> 17:49.283
Hank, give me a boost.

17:49.385 --> 17:53.048
I bet those light fixtures
are the perfect dander magnet.

17:58.027 --> 18:00.427
I can't see it, but I know it's in there.

18:00.530 --> 18:03.966
Pack your bags, you flaky bastards!
Dust mop!

18:08.004 --> 18:11.269
I can't believe I didn't eat this last night.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.449
- What are you doing?
- I thought I'd clean up a bit.

18:20.550 --> 18:25.283
I like it the way it is.
That is why it is the way it is.

18:26.256 --> 18:29.225
You used to have the best-looking
doghouse in the neighborhood!

18:29.325 --> 18:31.885
Now I bet it isn't even in the top 10!

18:31.995 --> 18:33.622
Why don't you move back in?

18:33.730 --> 18:36.858
Every night your dad has to watch
another man brush his dog.

18:36.966 --> 18:40.834
Every time Ladybird wags her tail,
your father dies a little.

18:41.738 --> 18:45.139
It was my dad's idea to move me
in here in the first place...

18:45.241 --> 18:49.177
so just relax. We got a good thing going.

18:49.479 --> 18:54.041
As long as I keep sneezing,
the lady next door can't say boo.

18:54.150 --> 18:55.276
[Dog barking]

18:55.385 --> 18:57.444
No pop-ins! Get out of here!

18:59.622 --> 19:00.850
Out, out!

19:04.894 --> 19:06.088
Out!

19:14.404 --> 19:16.201
Bill is gonna get it!

19:16.306 --> 19:17.864
[Bill chuckling]

19:17.974 --> 19:19.942
That's so cute.

19:20.043 --> 19:24.605
I made that game up.
That's our game. I wanna play.

19:25.648 --> 19:29.311
Those two look more alike after a week
than you did after 10 years.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.616
I've never dang old seen that little dog
so happy, man.

19:32.722 --> 19:36.624
Talking about that little dog's life,
you know, Bill's best friend, man.

19:37.293 --> 19:38.783
You want a beer, man?

19:39.762 --> 19:42.731
I don't wanna associate beer
with this kind of pain.

19:46.669 --> 19:49.160
Bobby, I brought you an air freshener.

19:50.173 --> 19:51.231
[Gasps]

19:51.941 --> 19:54.671
Peggy: [Whistling] Bobby!
Come on, Bobby Hill!

20:03.820 --> 20:05.287
BOBBY: Were we robbed?

20:06.589 --> 20:08.386
They took the carpeting.

20:08.491 --> 20:13.121
Robbers wouldn't do this good of a job
sanding and triple-varnishing the floors.

20:13.262 --> 20:15.730
We cleaned this house top to bottom
for you, Bobby.

20:15.832 --> 20:18.357
It is clean enough
to make computer chips in.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.265
Don't be afraid to breathe, Bobby.

20:20.370 --> 20:23.828
It's the only way we can find out
if we got all the dander.

20:29.912 --> 20:31.209
[Sneezing]

20:31.447 --> 20:32.539
Damn it.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.911
I knew we should have
steam-cleaned the ceiling...

20:37.020 --> 20:39.318
but that guy was so damn smug.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.922
[Peggy sighs dejectedly]

20:42.425 --> 20:44.484
Boy, the place sure feels empty.

20:44.594 --> 20:48.428
You know, no carpet, no dog, no son.

20:49.766 --> 20:51.996
Maybe I'll just go over to Bill's house.

20:52.101 --> 20:56.800
Hank, remember what I told the doctor.
You should not even touch Ladybird.

21:05.381 --> 21:07.781
Okay, Hank, you got five minutes.

21:08.651 --> 21:11.518
I won't say her name
because then she'll just get all excited...

21:11.621 --> 21:14.715
and jump up on me. I can't have that.

21:16.325 --> 21:19.852
No. She's starting to wag.
Dale, quick. Tape her tail to her leg.

21:20.263 --> 21:21.423
I'm on it.

21:22.131 --> 21:24.725
[Ladybird barking]

21:27.737 --> 21:29.534
Ladybird? No! Get out!

21:29.639 --> 21:31.766
Dad, look. I'm cured.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.934
I found a combination of pills that work.
See?

21:36.279 --> 21:39.680
Hey, girl, welcome home. You, too, boy.

21:39.782 --> 21:41.272
Thank you, Dad.

21:50.193 --> 21:51.717
HANK: You're ready?

21:54.430 --> 21:55.863
All right.

22:00.536 --> 22:05.098
I have a client in here I am trying to tutor,
so cool it down!

22:07.443 --> 22:10.071
Okay. Water.

22:11.047 --> 22:12.947
- Agua.
- Perfect.

22:16.719 --> 22:18.050
Good boy.

22:19.489 --> 22:19.622
DALE: We all came to see
the opening of a doghouse!

22:19.622 --> 22:22.216
DALE: We all came to see
the opening of a doghouse!
