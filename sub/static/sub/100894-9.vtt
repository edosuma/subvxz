[birds chirping]

01:17.202 --> 01:18.161
[door opens]

01:18.244 --> 01:21.498
Nerd, up and out!
I'm leaving for school early with CeCe.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.458
Come on. Mom's gotta work

01:23.541 --> 01:25.251
and Aunt Helen wants us
to be there on time.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.128
Kyle.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.421
If you wanna run with the big dogs,

01:28.505 --> 01:30.131
you can't be lying under the porch.
Let's go.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.054
Come on. Mock trial's counting on you,
man. Let's go. Today's the big day.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.182
All right.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.851
Better see you there... teammate.

01:47.023 --> 01:47.857
Hey.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.237
I let you skip church yesterday

01:52.320 --> 01:54.572
because I thought you were exhausted
from the play,

01:54.656 --> 01:56.366
but are you coming down with something?

01:57.408 --> 01:58.493
No, I don't think so.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.412
All right.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.625
Well, if you need a little extra time,
I can call Trotter, have him cover,

02:05.708 --> 02:07.460
and I can take you
to the courthouse myself.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.671
It's okay, Mom,
I can get to school on time.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.589
The walk will wake me up.

02:12.799 --> 02:13.716
All right.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.774
You feel good about the mock trial?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.945
We got this.
The kids are really... prepared,

02:34.654 --> 02:37.198
and I will be back by three,

02:37.782 --> 02:40.160
so we can do an early happy hour here.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.329
-Just us two.
-I really gotta get out to the farm.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.915
Jeremy's already chomping at the bit
to get this thing in motion.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.833
Mmm.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.001
As am I.

02:48.585 --> 02:52.130
I believe we can correct
the supply chain issue,

02:52.755 --> 02:56.718
and...
maximize the co-op's use of the land.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.011
I know you can.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.305
Jeremy and Davidson meeting's
only the first step.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.348
You see,
I have so much more to do before I...

03:03.141 --> 03:04.392
You have to leave again?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.352
I know.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.063
But you're here now
and that's all that matters.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.734
Do I selfishly want good old farmer Jeremy

03:12.817 --> 03:15.320
to be a hard case and drag his feet,

03:15.403 --> 03:18.990
and stall, and keep you here in town
for one more year?

03:19.073 --> 03:23.328
Of course I do, but this project
will be good for Serenity.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.830
So, sooner is better, I guess.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.959
We have a chance
of getting some fall crops in.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.712
It's too late for summer,
but we could spend those months

03:32.795 --> 03:34.756
figuring out crop rotation,

03:34.839 --> 03:38.927
maybe plant some high biomass vegetation
to improve the soil structure.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.303
[Helen moans]

03:42.430 --> 03:43.264
[Ryan] Mmm.

03:43.348 --> 03:48.019
Smart is so, so sexy on you. Mmm.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.604
We make a good team

03:50.480 --> 03:53.566
in everything we do, don't we?

03:54.984 --> 03:56.778
I could seriously get used to this.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.532
Me too.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.828
[Helen laughs]

04:06.454 --> 04:07.580
[Ryan chuckles]

04:09.123 --> 04:10.792
[Dana Sue] Okay, now don't be nervous.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.044
I'm not. I only have, like, two lines.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.171
Kyle is the one
who's doing the heavy lifting.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.673
I wish I could be there.

04:16.756 --> 04:19.050
You sure you don't want me
to cancel my appointment at the farm?

04:19.133 --> 04:22.262
No. Ryan wouldn't have set this up
if it wasn't important.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.223
-I gotta run.
-All right, okay. Break a leg!

04:25.848 --> 04:27.684
Hey, get someone to tape it for me, hear?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.228
New century, who's tape?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.063
[chuckles]

05:29.329 --> 05:30.246
Ah.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.706
There's no reception.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.208
You want a cell tower to spoil this view?

05:34.292 --> 05:37.378
Well, I was hoping to text Annie
one more time and wish her luck.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.756
Well, I think the three times
you texted her before we left

05:39.839 --> 05:42.383
-will have to see her through.
-Hey, you texted Helen!

05:42.467 --> 05:43.801
I texted her twice.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.511
I'm playing it cool.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.098
-Aren't these fields beautiful?
-Man,

05:49.766 --> 05:51.559
I haven't been out here in an age.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.644
And you haven't bought
from the co-op in a while?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.980
Uh, a little bit here and there.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.024
I mean,
Benji's produce was always top-notch,

05:58.107 --> 06:00.777
but sporadic, so with the exception
of his strawberries,

06:00.860 --> 06:02.737
as the restaurant grew, I found it better

06:02.820 --> 06:05.031
to focus on commercial farming
that brings me everything.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.158
Jeremy and I'll find out
how to fix the supply issue.

06:07.241 --> 06:11.537
Well, if you can get Benji's tomatoes
back in my kitchen, I'm all in.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.998
No, wait. Who's this Jeremy?

06:14.082 --> 06:15.875
Unofficial new head of the co-op.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.961
His family's been leasing from Benji
for decades.

06:20.546 --> 06:25.927
Yeah, you gotta admire people
that... stay somewhere, you know,

06:26.010 --> 06:27.512
and put down roots.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.598
Can we please stay on topic?

06:30.681 --> 06:33.142
Can you please stick around? For Helen?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.061
So if we get more chefs like you on board,

06:35.144 --> 06:38.106
we can entice more farmers to lease,
so I need your opinion of the produce

06:38.189 --> 06:39.982
and an estimate
of what they'll need to produce

06:40.066 --> 06:41.484
to get you to commit to exclusivity.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.195
Uh, no,
don't talk to me about exclusivity.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.822
I haven't even met the old man yet.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.281
The who?

06:48.324 --> 06:49.951
The... [stammers] ...Jeremy.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.161
Ah. Um...

06:52.745 --> 06:55.748
Ah. Here's the old man now. Jeremy!

06:57.750 --> 06:58.751
Oh. [chuckles]

06:59.168 --> 07:00.044
Hey, buddy.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.716
[Cal] Did you hear from Kyle?
We need to go.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.011
His phone's either off or dead.
It's going straight to voicemail.

07:09.929 --> 07:10.888
This isn't like him.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.934
He was in the shower when I left.
I thought he was right behind me.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.478
Don't worry, Ty, he probably is.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.523
[sighs] And we have a schedule to keep.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.567
[Tyler] He always gets a little mopey
after a show,

07:22.650 --> 07:24.193
but he's really down this time.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.572
I guess it's harder
when you've been the star.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.286
[sighs] So, Maddie says that he's probably
walking slowly so he can run lines

07:33.369 --> 07:34.829
and we should go on ahead.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.582
She says she'll scoop him up
and meet us at the courthouse.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.625
Hey.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.837
If she's not worried,
we shouldn't be either.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.422
[bus engine starting]

07:47.133 --> 07:49.051
Trotter. Could you please--

07:49.135 --> 07:52.096
Cover the front desk while you do
whatever it is you need to do? I sure can.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.598
[sighs] Thank you.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.308
What would I do without you?

07:55.391 --> 07:57.226
I don't plan to let you figure it out.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.821
[Gabe] Bulldogs on trial! [barks]

08:08.905 --> 08:10.907
Gabe, I don't think
that's what you're meant to say.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.367
Get in there.
Annie, let me talk to you for one second.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.578
-Yeah?
-Sweetheart, we still can't find Kyle.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.997
-That's not good. Where could he be?
-Don't worry about it.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.125
Aunt Maddie's gonna try and find him,
but I need to ask a favor of you.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.210
Of course. Anything.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.213
If Kyle doesn't come here in time,
I need you to fill in for him.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.716
-Aunt Helen, no, I can't.
-You're the only one who can double up.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.218
You're first called to the witness stand,

08:30.301 --> 08:32.845
so that gives you enough time
to switch over to Kyle's part.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.805
But I play a female medical expert.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.307
His part is a high school boy.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.934
So we'll put your hair up in a ponytail,

08:38.017 --> 08:40.186
put a little eyeliner
across your upper lip, you'll be fine.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.146
-Gross!
-You were the one practicing with him.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.856
You know what he was planning to say.
Listen, Annie,

08:43.940 --> 08:46.776
I need you to do this for the team. Yes?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.238
-Fine.
-There you go.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.783
-But what about--
-Miss Helen, am I rocking the lawyer look?

08:53.866 --> 08:54.951
You are perfection.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.119
Yes, you look better than I did
my first day in court.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.287
-Really?
-Yeah. Annie,

08:58.371 --> 09:00.248
Annie, you got this. You got this.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.832
Come on, bright eyes. Bright eyes.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.585
[chuckles] CeCe, I want you to have these.

09:07.004 --> 09:07.838
Are you sure?

09:08.839 --> 09:10.633
Yeah, it's my gift.

09:11.759 --> 09:12.593
Thanks.

09:13.719 --> 09:14.845
[Helen] Let's go get 'em.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.392
Hey, Mr. Daniel.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.311
You haven't seen Kyle this morning
by chance, have you?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.604
Shouldn't he be in school?

09:24.647 --> 09:25.731
[sighs]

09:25.815 --> 09:28.401
-I'll certainly keep an eye out.
-Thank you so much.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.695
-And have him call me, okay?
-I will do that.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.122
-He's not at the hospital.
-Thank God.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.125
I checked the movie theaters,
the tennis courts, the gazebo.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.293
Just no sign of him.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.422
Sheriff Bolden said
he'd send out a cruiser or two, so...

09:50.673 --> 09:52.341
Just... I don't know what I missed.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.845
He was a little off this weekend,
but I thought he needed rest.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.514
When was the last time
you talked to him? The play?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.099
No, I didn't talk to him at the play.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.019
I got called away before it started.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.438
So the garage?

10:05.980 --> 10:06.814
Great.

10:06.897 --> 10:07.773
[scoffs]

10:08.149 --> 10:10.067
Wait, you trying to blame this on me?

10:11.485 --> 10:12.361
All right, look.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.448
The garage was a mistake, okay?

10:15.531 --> 10:19.410
And I shouldn't have been on call
the night of the play, all right?

10:19.493 --> 10:21.746
-I'm sorry.
-Well, maybe Noreen would know.

10:22.079 --> 10:25.082
I mean, she and Kyle
have been pretty simpatico lately.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.500
No.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.586
Well, did you ask her?

10:30.504 --> 10:32.006
Noreen left me, Maddie.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.054
Well, call her anyways.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.805
I'm not sure she'd answer.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.849
Bill, call her.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.771
I'm gonna take the candy shop.
You take the library.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.733
Maybe start with an apology.

10:52.568 --> 10:53.527
Just a suggestion.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.620
[judge] Today, we're considering the case

11:02.703 --> 11:05.289
of <i>Mayford v Langley Sheep</i>
<i>and Cattle Company,</i>

11:05.748 --> 11:07.083
a wrongful death lawsuit.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.086
I invite the prosecution
to address the jury

11:10.169 --> 11:11.379
with opening statements.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.094
On July 8th, 2016,

11:18.177 --> 11:19.845
a group of Langley high school students

11:19.929 --> 11:22.390
hiked to a spot near Coakley Creek
and went tubing in the pond.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.600
Two days later, three students became ill

11:24.684 --> 11:27.645
from what our experts determined
was cryptosporidiosis

11:27.728 --> 11:29.605
caused by bacteria in the pond.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.148
Christopher Mayford died of his illness.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.567
We will show that Langley Sheep
and Cattle Company knew

11:33.651 --> 11:37.238
or should have known that the creek
was polluted with animal waste runoff

11:37.321 --> 11:38.489
produced by their herds.

11:38.572 --> 11:42.034
They did not take reasonable
or required steps to address this issue.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.161
Thank you.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.084
Would the defense like to address the jury
with opening statements?

12:01.053 --> 12:01.929
Good morning.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.099
[Jeremy]
We've got about 200 workable acres

12:05.182 --> 12:08.102
and two sizable greenhouses
for the winter months.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.895
I'd love to build a third, but...

12:09.979 --> 12:11.522
Need more tenants first.

12:11.605 --> 12:14.859
The right kind of tenants.
I refuse to give up on organic practices.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.944
See, organic is more delicious
on my plate,

12:17.027 --> 12:18.487
but it takes more out of your pocket.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.948
-[chuckles]
-With enough demand from area restaurants,

12:21.031 --> 12:23.492
we could potentially lower
the leasing cost structure.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.162
It's just a matter
of, uh, putting the pieces together.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.914
Which, I suppose,
is where you come in, ma'am.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.584
Oh, no. [chuckles]

12:31.667 --> 12:33.669
No, you did not just "ma'am" me.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.171
[laughs]

12:38.215 --> 12:41.844
Oh, Jeremy. Jeremy,
don't you play with my heart this way.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.179
Are these Mortgage Lifters?

12:43.262 --> 12:45.473
Couldn't think of anything
more fitting to plant.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.641
Oh, Lord. This takes me back.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.852
When I was ordering everything from Benji,

12:49.935 --> 12:54.231
my tomato salad would sell out
in the first hour of service every night.

12:55.649 --> 12:56.734
Thank you.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.195
Uh-oh.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.404
[laughs]

13:01.113 --> 13:02.656
-Um...
-Thank you.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.704
See, you do not get that complex tang

13:08.788 --> 13:11.332
and the terrific mouthfeel

13:11.916 --> 13:13.375
from a commercial crop.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.502
You don't.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.836
[laughs]

13:15.920 --> 13:18.589
[Ryan clears throat]
Once the new greenhouse is built,

13:18.672 --> 13:22.843
we'll... They'll be able to keep
these beauties in rotation year-round.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.513
Well,
then you'll have all my business again.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.348
So long as I get first choice.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.810
See, I intend to remain
the best restaurant in Low Country.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.562
Your wish is my command, not ma'am.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.980
[laughs]

13:35.064 --> 13:35.898
Thank you.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.983
So I think we could do
something really amazing here.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.694
-Should we head back, talk numbers?
-Not until I've wrapped my lips

13:40.778 --> 13:43.030
around one
of these Fort Laramie strawberries.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.990
You can taste anything here you'd like.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.452
Okay.

13:49.078 --> 13:52.206
[Simon] Doctor,
what exactly is cryptosporidiosis?

13:52.623 --> 13:56.168
Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrheal disease
caused by microscopic parasites.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.754
Over the last two decades, crypto,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.673
as it is known, has become recognized

14:00.756 --> 14:03.092
as one of the most common causes
of waterborne disease

14:03.175 --> 14:04.844
in humans in the US.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.428
And in your professional opinion,

14:06.512 --> 14:08.305
how was Christopher infected
with these parasites?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.642
The infected creature
sheds cryptosporidia in its stool.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.062
The victim comes in contact
with this bacteria

14:15.145 --> 14:16.313
and is in turn infected.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.024
So animal waste byproducts
from Langley Sheep and Cattle

14:19.108 --> 14:20.818
could have been the cause
of Mr. Mayford's illness

14:20.901 --> 14:21.986
and subsequent death?

14:22.069 --> 14:23.779
In my professional opinion, yes.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.283
There's no other explanation
for the presence of these parasites

14:27.366 --> 14:28.576
in Coakley Creek.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.660
Thank you, Doctor.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.161
No further questions, Your Honor.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.331
[judge] Defense. Cross examination?

14:37.334 --> 14:38.919
No cross from the defense, Your Honor.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.090
[judge] Well, in that case,

14:43.173 --> 14:45.009
we'll take a brief break
for those that need it.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.385
We're back in ten.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.511
[judge bangs gavel]

14:51.056 --> 14:52.516
I'm gonna go try Maddie again.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.061
Let the transformation begin.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.522
We're rocking this. [laughs]

14:59.523 --> 15:01.567
Hey, you can wear this for authenticity.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.444
High school jock, right?

15:03.527 --> 15:04.695
-Thanks!
-Yeah.

15:05.446 --> 15:09.450
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna kick Kyle's butt
for putting you in this position.

15:21.003 --> 15:21.837
Nothing.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.340
He's still not at the hospital.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.550
Or the comic book store,

15:26.634 --> 15:29.219
the new book store,
or the used book store.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.139
[both sigh]

15:32.222 --> 15:34.808
Hey, Maddie.
The boy's just having a moment, okay?

15:34.892 --> 15:37.561
He'll turn up.
All of Serenity's on high alert now.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.438
Yeah, no, I know. I know.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.441
[sobs] I just... I feel like something...

15:43.776 --> 15:46.946
Hey, you remember
when Kyle lost himself in the attic

15:47.029 --> 15:49.031
for nearly half a day
because he was all riled up?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.074
[chuckles]

15:50.950 --> 15:54.495
Because I didn't make him a Superman cape
because I thought he liked Batman better.

15:55.996 --> 15:56.956
Well,

15:57.414 --> 16:00.459
you spotted a trail of Goldfish crackers
and found him,

16:01.210 --> 16:03.712
but you just watched him
and let him pout it out.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.881
You're gonna find him again.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.719
Hey, you're a wonderful mother.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.012
Yeah.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.222
[phone vibrates]

16:13.806 --> 16:14.723
Oh, this is Cal.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.602
He's at the courthouse with the kids.
Maybe he knows something.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.981
-Hello.
-[Cal] <i>Hey, any word from Kyle?</i>

16:22.064 --> 16:22.982
No.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.900
But there are no accident reports either,
so...

16:24.984 --> 16:25.985
So that's good news.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.988
-Want me to come be with you?
-No. No, no, no.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.074
You stay there with Helen and the kids.
Maybe he'll show up there.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.033
Maybe.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.995
I can leave. Helen's got this.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.830
No, it's okay. Bill's here.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.289
<i>Hey, listen.</i>

16:40.499 --> 16:42.626
<i>Will you tell Ty that I hope he does well?</i>

16:43.335 --> 16:44.503
Uh, yeah. Will do.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.338
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.348
-Not at the courthouse.
-No.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.144
Maybe I'll go home.

17:00.769 --> 17:01.603
[chuckles]

17:01.687 --> 17:03.814
See if he's in the attic
with his Goldfish.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.067
Hey, stay at the house.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.611
All right, have your mom
pick up Katie from school,

17:09.695 --> 17:11.363
and I'll drive out
towards the creek, okay?

17:11.447 --> 17:12.448
Okay.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.005
[Dana Sue] Soil stewardship.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.549
I haven't heard the term,
but I like the concept.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.926
Taking care of the land
starts with taking care of the soil.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.636
And in a regenerative way.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.556
[Ryan] We'll have heartier plants
that last longer and thrive.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.349
We're gonna make a good team.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.772
-[Ryan] Dana Sue?
-Okay, knock me down and steal my teeth!

17:45.147 --> 17:47.691
Is this a Skylark?

17:48.025 --> 17:49.693
-It sure is.
-[Dana Sue laughs]

17:51.153 --> 17:53.363
Oh, wow.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.909
My daddy and I restored a Skylark
when I was in high school.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.036
I mean, not to this level, but...

17:59.119 --> 18:00.829
-What happened to that one?
-[Dana Sue] Well,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.539
yeah, long story.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.125
Best told over an old-fashioned
made with local bitters.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.418
You ever had one?

18:06.502 --> 18:07.503
Sign me up.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.799
So she ride as good as she looks?

18:11.882 --> 18:13.467
Wanna find out? [taps door]

18:14.885 --> 18:16.303
I would love that.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.347
How about we gather up
in a couple of hours?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.140
Sign me up.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.562
[CeCe] Georgie, I'm sorry
for the loss of your friend Christopher.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.064
Thank you.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.024
Do you swim in Coakley Creek often?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.567
Few times a month in the summer.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.905
Please confirm there was a sign
that clearly read "do not swim."

18:34.988 --> 18:35.823
You've seen it?

18:35.906 --> 18:37.533
That sign's been there for years.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.910
-Way before the cattle ranch--
-A yes or no will suffice.

18:39.993 --> 18:43.747
Did you see a sign
that clearly stated "do not swim"?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.166
Yes,

18:46.750 --> 18:49.211
and we ignored it. Like we always have.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.508
So you make it a habit
to ignore the rules...

18:57.010 --> 18:58.345
and do whatever you want?

19:05.978 --> 19:06.895
Georgie.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.733
That's not what I'm saying at all.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.320
I'm saying that nobody died
until the cattle ra--

19:15.404 --> 19:18.782
No, nobody died
until you decided to ignore caution.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.367
Do you break a lot of rules?

19:23.662 --> 19:26.081
-No, I follow them
-You're under oath.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.001
I follow them. Most of the time.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.837
But you broke them that day,
and look what happened.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.716
It's your fault Chris is dead.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.303
Everything that happened is your fault.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.470
I wasn't the only one!

19:40.554 --> 19:42.806
[CeCe]
You knew it was wrong and did it anyway.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.767
You have nobody to blame but yourself.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.270
Objection! Badgering the witness.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.730
Overruled.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.609
No further questions, Your Honor.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.305
It's good to see you, Kyle.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.474
Missed you yesterday.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.936
[chuckles]

20:32.314 --> 20:33.398
[June sighs]

20:34.107 --> 20:37.444
You were an outstanding Puck.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.403
[chuckles]

20:38.820 --> 20:41.615
Must have taken a lot out of you
to play that part, huh?

20:49.748 --> 20:52.793
Do any of your grown-ups know
you're here and not in school?

20:55.671 --> 20:56.797
I just couldn't go today.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.798
Mmm.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.092
I know the feeling.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.721
Some days, the biggest leap of faith
I make is getting out of bed.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.894
-Is-- Is it okay that I'm in here?
-Always!

21:15.440 --> 21:17.943
I just couldn't find anywhere to go
where I felt...

21:20.404 --> 21:21.238
I don't know.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.449
Sugar, you don't have to know.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.954
Sometimes your heart just tells you
where to go when you're searching.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.208
Sit a spell.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.127
Be still.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.047
You don't have to talk to me.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.968
You can talk to Him if you'd rather.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.223
I think so.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.976
I am gonna have to call your mama

21:51.727 --> 21:54.271
and let her know you're okay, but...

21:55.355 --> 21:57.858
I can ask her to give you
and Jesus a little more time.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.364
I'll be right out in the narthex
if you'd like me to join in.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.033
you are never alone...

22:08.285 --> 22:09.286
And remember...

22:10.037 --> 22:11.413
you are never alone...

22:12.080 --> 22:13.623
especially in the house of the Lord.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.134
Mm, no. Nope. There you are.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.679
Yes, still looking fabulous.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.265
[chuckles]

22:30.349 --> 22:31.350
[gasps]

22:31.933 --> 22:34.936
Aw. Look at my beautiful baby.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.229
[chuckles]

22:41.234 --> 22:42.444
[sighs]

22:47.616 --> 22:48.909
Yes!

22:50.827 --> 22:51.912
Let's hit the road.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.588
Love is patient and is kind.

23:02.172 --> 23:05.300
Even when love needs to take
a deep breath first.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.053
[both breathe deep]

23:22.859 --> 23:23.819
I'm sorry, Mom.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.490
Oh, Lord.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.702
Do you know how much
everybody was worried about you?

23:33.745 --> 23:36.289
Your father and I
looked everywhere for you.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.876
Dad was looking for me too?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.253
Of course he was.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.297
He had every eyeball
in the sheriff's department

23:44.381 --> 23:45.841
looking for you too.

23:48.927 --> 23:49.845
What happened?

23:52.222 --> 23:53.723
I just needed some time to think.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.851
To think? [chuckles]

23:56.518 --> 24:00.439
Did you think about how this escapade
affected dozens of other people?

24:01.731 --> 24:02.566
Me,

24:03.066 --> 24:04.276
your dad, Nana,

24:05.152 --> 24:06.778
Aunt Helen and mock trial?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.908
Honestly,
I didn't think anyone would really notice.

24:13.493 --> 24:14.536
Or care.

24:16.746 --> 24:17.789
[tearing up]

24:19.666 --> 24:20.834
My sweet boy.

24:22.669 --> 24:23.712
[inhales]

24:25.672 --> 24:28.341
I'm sorry I didn't see the pain
that you were in.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.636
And I...

24:32.053 --> 24:35.474
[sniffs] I didn't realize
how much she meant to you.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.393
What'd she say to you?

24:38.977 --> 24:39.853
Nothing.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.481
Your dad told me that she left.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.109
Yeah.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.320
Noreen...

24:49.738 --> 24:50.655
she was...

24:53.241 --> 24:54.284
[sighs]

24:54.367 --> 24:55.368
Hey,

24:55.952 --> 24:58.663
you do not have to be protective
of my feelings.

25:00.081 --> 25:03.585
She was good to you,
and I'm grateful to her for that.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.673
[sighs] Oh, Lord.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.219
I have been surrounded
by so many squeaky wheels lately, I...

25:14.513 --> 25:17.015
I didn't think I had any grease left.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.852
And you have always been so independent.

on a scholarship, if you ask me.

35:49.689 --> 35:53.734
Ty said you were great.
Wish I'd have been there to encourage you.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.320
I wouldn't have needed encouragement
if you'd been there.

35:58.197 --> 35:59.240
Right.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.994
Anyway, being grounded alone sucks,

36:03.077 --> 36:05.663

to have some company.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.930
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.850

a little time off her sentence.

Thank you, Madam Defense Attorney.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.606
-I will take that under advisement.
-Mmm.

36:32.315 --> 36:35.651
And are we taking the sexy farmer
under advisement as well?

36:35.735 --> 36:38.571
-What? What sexy farmer?
-Shh.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.656
Dana Sue,
you better pour it out right now.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.158
I don't know what she's talking about.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.202
-She does!
-We're fighting.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.579
[Dana Sue] All right, listen.

Farmer Jeremy took me on a drive today
and that is all.

36:50.958 --> 36:51.918
[Maddie] What?

36:52.376 --> 36:53.628
The little old farmer?

36:53.711 --> 36:57.006
-Oh, he's not little, and he is not old.
-No, no. Oh, no.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.300
He's beautiful.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.259
What?

37:00.718 --> 37:03.054
His arms and his chest and...

37:03.804 --> 37:05.681
-Oh, dear.
-[Helen] Mmm!

37:05.765 --> 37:07.767
But I would have skipped it all
to help you find Kyle

37:07.850 --> 37:09.185
if the damn text had come through.

37:09.268 --> 37:12.104
Well, you were busy.
You both were, and I had it handled.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.899
Although I do think
that we owe Trotter a raise.

37:14.982 --> 37:17.235
-Oh, bless his heart.
-Bless him.

37:17.693 --> 37:18.694
[Dana Sue chuckles]

37:18.778 --> 37:20.529
Yeah, and you know, and hand to God,

37:21.489 --> 37:22.615
Bill stepped up today.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.200
Like a good dad.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.162
While I haven't been a very good mom.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.539
What? Do not talk nonsense.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.876
I didn't even see Kyle falling apart
right under my nose.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.920
These kids don't always
make it easy to see.

37:36.003 --> 37:39.465
But honestly,
Bill played a really important role today,

37:39.548 --> 37:41.133
even though I didn't think
he had it in him.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.053
Well, it's easier to step up in a crisis.

37:44.136 --> 37:45.930
Well, maybe I haven't allowed him.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.350
Maybe it's... time I let him try?

37:49.433 --> 37:51.936
[laughs] Yeah? And what will
Mistress Noreen think about that?

37:54.313 --> 37:55.147
She left him.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.108
-You're lying!
-What?

37:57.191 --> 37:58.943
I am serious. [chuckles]

37:59.360 --> 38:03.239
Look, I don't know the details,
but Bill doesn't think she's coming back.

38:03.322 --> 38:07.702
Oh! That woman is having his baby.
There is no way she is <i>gone </i>gone.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.954
Well, nevertheless, bye-bye.

[indistinct background chatter]

38:17.295 --> 38:18.963
[Dana Sue]
Yeah, we really love that about you.

38:19.046 --> 38:20.506
That's why we keep you around.

38:23.009 --> 38:23.926
Kyle...

38:25.928 --> 38:27.221
the whole deal today,

38:27.305 --> 38:29.807
it didn't have anything to do
with you and me, right?

38:30.224 --> 38:31.684
No. No, no. We're good.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.228
I mean, if you say we're good,
then we're good.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.314
-I think we're good.
-Good.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.399
-Stop saying good.
-That would be good.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.818
[Tyler] Later, prisoners.

38:40.901 --> 38:43.821
I am a law-abiding citizen,
so I am going to Gabe's!

38:44.238 --> 38:45.114
[Maddie] Bye!

38:45.948 --> 38:47.033
[door opens]

38:48.409 --> 38:49.243
[door closes]

38:49.327 --> 38:52.079
Ty thinks he's going to get away
with not going to prom with CeCe.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.956
[chuckles] Foolish boy.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.124
[laughs]

38:57.793 --> 39:00.713
Hey, maybe our moms will let us
be grounded together on prom night.

39:00.796 --> 39:02.798
Maybe watch a movie for good behavior.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.050
It's a date.

39:04.717 --> 39:05.760
I mean, you know, it's a--

39:05.843 --> 39:07.678
It's a movie. Gotcha.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.763
[chuckles]

39:15.853 --> 39:17.355
Thanks for the ride to school.

39:18.064 --> 39:21.192
Yeah, I thought we might be able
to have a little chat this way.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.529
I'm sorry that I worried you yesterday.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.949
Mom says
you were all out searching all day.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.370
Well, I was. A lot of people were.

39:35.081 --> 39:37.249
I know, sir, and I'm sorry.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.544
-I just--
-Kyle,

39:40.628 --> 39:44.090
did you talk to Noreen
before she left the other night?

39:46.425 --> 39:47.259
Yeah.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.011
[sighs]

39:50.805 --> 39:52.807
Yeah, it's not easy to understand,

39:53.432 --> 39:54.558
let alone deal with.

39:55.726 --> 39:56.685
It isn't...

39:58.020 --> 39:59.772
and I'm trying, but--

39:59.855 --> 40:02.024
Did she explain to you why she left?

40:06.612 --> 40:07.613
You suck.

40:07.696 --> 40:08.823
Excuse me?

40:08.906 --> 40:10.783
I hate that she left,
but I don't blame her.

40:10.866 --> 40:12.743
I mean, did you ever really even see her?

40:12.827 --> 40:15.746
You sure as heck never see me,
but now you wanna talk?

40:16.372 --> 40:17.331
No, sir.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.751
Well, wait just a damn minute now.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.211
I'll walk to school.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.807
We make a good team,

40:35.641 --> 40:36.559
you and me.

40:37.351 --> 40:38.561
And the Magnolias

40:39.145 --> 40:40.312
and the farmers.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.315
You know,
when I began this redevelopment plan,

40:43.399 --> 40:47.445
it was all about leaving a legacy
here in Serenity

40:48.028 --> 40:49.071
and here you are.

40:49.738 --> 40:50.614
Home.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.992
Like a missing puzzle piece.

40:56.745 --> 40:59.081
You know, there is no one

40:59.165 --> 41:01.333
that I would rather share a dream with.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.585
[kisses]

41:02.668 --> 41:04.086
I love you so much.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.754
[chuckles] I love you too!

41:06.422 --> 41:07.298
Mmm.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.009
The future's, like, limitless.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.595
Can you imagine
what Serenity's gonna look like

41:12.678 --> 41:14.930
when our kids are our age?

41:19.143 --> 41:20.436
You said "our kids"?

41:22.062 --> 41:23.647
W-- Where did that come from?

41:25.316 --> 41:28.277
-[chuckles] Ry...
-I mean, you know how I feel about this.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.279
We spoke about it in San Francisco.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.907
Yeah, but that was a long time ago.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.576
A lot has... A lot has changed since then.

41:35.659 --> 41:36.619
Not that.

41:42.249 --> 41:43.584
Do we have a problem?

41:54.428 --> 41:56.430
