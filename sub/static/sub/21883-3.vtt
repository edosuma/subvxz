NIGHTCLUB DISTRICT

00:28.862 --> 00:29.988
Three with everything.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.199
Hey!

00:33.825 --> 00:35.076
-I'll wash it for you.
-No.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.787
Come on! And I'll vacuum
the interior at no extra cost.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.373
Come on, sir, they know me here.
Right, Don Juan?

00:40.457 --> 00:42.667
-Yes, sir.
-Give me a chance.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.752
OK. Wash it.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.253
-I'll wash it.
-Quickly.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.212
Extra quick.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.377
Why have you not visited me?

01:26.461 --> 01:27.962
I was on vacation.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.509
I was with my dad
in Tamazula, doing business.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.968
We've got him.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.721
El Chapo is in Tamazula.

01:47.857 --> 01:52.070
<i>I feel the warmth from</i>
<i>my boiling blood</i>

01:52.153 --> 01:56.783
<i>I feel the fear, sweat dripping away</i>

01:56.866 --> 02:01.079
<i>There's a stillness that</i>
<i>nothing transmits</i>

02:01.204 --> 02:07.418
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

02:07.627 --> 02:11.923
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

02:12.006 --> 02:16.052
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:20.265
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

02:20.765 --> 02:25.436
<i>To unleash my return</i>

02:29.440 --> 02:33.653
<i>I have the dust that</i>
<i>protects the road</i>

02:33.736 --> 02:38.158
<i>I have the branches</i>
<i>of a leafless tree</i>

02:38.283 --> 02:42.537
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

02:42.620 --> 02:49.043
<i>There are silhouettes</i>
<i>that come to meet me</i>

02:49.168 --> 02:53.423
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

02:53.506 --> 02:57.010
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

02:57.510 --> 03:01.306
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

03:02.223 --> 03:06.686
<i>To unleash my return</i>

03:09.230 --> 03:12.358
TAMAZULA MOUNTAINS
DURANGO, MEXICO

03:24.287 --> 03:25.538
Tell the boss they are coming up.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.956
Hey, boss!

03:33.212 --> 03:34.672
Hey! What's up?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.467
What's up, bud.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.469
Hello, Chapo!

03:39.552 --> 03:40.720
How was your trip?

03:41.888 --> 03:42.889
Too many fucking scorpions.

03:46.851 --> 03:47.894
How are you?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.520
Let's go get Ramón, then.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.981
I just have to bring one to Don Sol.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.776
We'll get rid of the other one.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.862
Ramón is pure brawn.
We'll kick him out of Tijuana easily.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.240
Not that easy, man.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.034
The Avendaños have learned
their lesson well.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.620
They know if they stay on their turf,
they're safe.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.206
We can hit them through Carlillos.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.003
Carlillos is their trusted man.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.964
Didn't he work for you?

04:17.131 --> 04:18.007
A long time ago.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.094
And he's been very loyal,
since his childhood.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.726
Well, then he'll have to switch loyalties.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.691
Hello?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.150
Hello, Carlillos.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.738
<i>Don't even think of hanging up.</i>
<i>You'll just make it worse.</i>

04:40.822 --> 04:43.283
Silvia, I am at work.
I can't talk to you right now.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.837
Answer that shit!

04:57.338 --> 04:59.590
<i>Ramón is around, isn't he?</i>

04:59.674 --> 05:00.883
Yeah, what do you want?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.260
You've been missed, bastard.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.639
We want to have you working with us again.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.391
Our thing is over with, Silvia.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.268
<i>Don't be pathetic.</i>

05:12.145 --> 05:15.064
You know if word gets out about
this call, you're a dead man, huh?

05:16.190 --> 05:18.026
<i>You know Ramón well...</i>

05:18.109 --> 05:20.528
<i>You know he shoots first, and asks later.</i>

05:21.988 --> 05:24.449
We want your boss,
and you're going to help us, Carlillos.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.453
<i>And if you want to keep living,</i>
<i>don't you dare tell him.</i>

05:28.995 --> 05:29.954
Wait for instructions.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.713
Stop it. We're done, Silvia.
Don't call me again.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.093
Excuse me, boss.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.970
Silvia doesn't understand.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.431
She wants me to leave my wife!

05:51.225 --> 05:53.352
Oh, look at this guy!

05:56.230 --> 05:58.441
We have a stud in Tijuana!

06:00.777 --> 06:02.945
<i>Ismael has scared Carlillos.</i>

06:03.946 --> 06:07.408
<i>Now it's our tun to force him</i>
<i>to forget his loyalty and help us.</i>

06:09.160 --> 06:10.119
Wife...

06:11.329 --> 06:12.163
or children?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.082
Whomever you find.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.385
They found us!

06:41.943 --> 06:43.111
<i>Go in, go in!</i>

06:59.252 --> 07:00.503
Attack on my signal!

08:12.575 --> 08:14.619
Jaguar, they got away, bastard!

09:06.379 --> 09:08.464
We have to wait till dusk.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.883
Till they stop patrolling.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.723
Do you recognize their uniforms?

09:17.807 --> 09:18.933
No.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.476
These are no regular soldiers.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.521
They're special forces.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.633
Do you still drink Scotch on the rocks?

11:20.388 --> 11:22.056
It's been a long time since we spoke...

11:34.443 --> 11:35.653
I was busy.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.030
But now I have more time to spare.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.116
I voted for you for congress.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.038
At this time, my political career
depends on a drug lord.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.584
There's nothing I can do now, but wait.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.003
You've never been
too good at waiting, huh?

11:54.922 --> 11:56.340
I'm still not good at it.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.107
Same rate?

12:36.755 --> 12:39.341
ALMOLOYA PRISON
MEXICO

12:49.518 --> 12:51.896
The lawyer is working
on your defense, uncle.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.982
Our relative says to just be patient, OK?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.862
You... How's school going?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.739
Fine.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.324
But I want to get in on the cultivation.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.700
Fucking kid...

13:05.409 --> 13:07.661
They have told you
to finish school first...

13:07.745 --> 13:09.705
I can do both things, can't I?

13:10.372 --> 13:12.791
-I'm not like this one.
-Hey, bitch!

13:20.758 --> 13:22.510
You've got to get out soon, uncle.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.723
So you can give me a hand
to convince our relative...

13:33.312 --> 13:34.772
We can stay here for a few days.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.273
SAFE HOUSE
MAZATLÁN, MEXICO

13:36.357 --> 13:38.400
No one else knows we're here.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.327
You figure out how the fuck
they found us in Tamazula?

13:48.410 --> 13:50.246
The satellite phone is encrypted.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.789
So that wasn't the way.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.916
The few who knew the location

13:54.166 --> 13:57.545
were all warned not to give away
anything over the phone.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.462
What, then?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.674
They might have set up bugs.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.425
Send messages to all the houses.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.219
<i>Have them check everything.</i>

14:06.011 --> 14:07.763
<i>We can't be caught off guard again.</i>

14:14.228 --> 14:15.104
Anything?

14:16.981 --> 14:17.815
Nothing.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.510
-Hey!
-I'll wash it for you.

14:46.969 --> 14:47.803
Boss.

14:52.683 --> 14:53.809
This was in your car.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.773
Fucking idiots!

15:07.156 --> 15:08.073
One?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.075
We lost contact.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.294
We've found Carlillos' weakness.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.505
-His wife?
-No.

15:23.589 --> 15:27.509
She is living somewhere in the U.S.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.719
This is his sister.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.266
That bastard knows
how to protect his family.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.435
She's here, in Mazatlán.

15:44.818 --> 15:45.861
You know what to do.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.252
Aracely!

16:03.420 --> 16:05.005
Don't you remember me?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.174
It's Toño!

16:07.257 --> 16:10.177
A friend of your brother Carlillos.
We were Jr. High classmates.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.389
Sorry, but... my brother
always had lots of friends.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.601
Can I give you my phone number
so he can call me?

16:17.685 --> 16:20.187
I'll be in town a few days,
and I'd like to catch up.

16:22.773 --> 16:23.816
Go ahead.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.541
BENJAMIN AVENDAÑO'S RESIDENCE
TIJUANA, MÉXICO

16:43.669 --> 16:46.296
Charalito?
Take the kids to the club.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.507
And wait for them until they're finished.

16:48.590 --> 16:49.717
And stop at the dry cleaners.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.885
Tell them I lost the ticket,
but it's under my name.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.266
Are you sending them with just Charalito?

16:57.349 --> 16:59.226
We're in Tijuana, Ramón.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.021
Alambre!

17:02.938 --> 17:04.023
You go with them.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.570
Hello?

17:09.653 --> 17:13.657
<i>Your sister Aracely says "hi"...</i>

17:39.058 --> 17:40.100
Carlillos...

17:42.102 --> 17:45.481
If you collaborate,
nothing bad will happen to you.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.691
Nor to her...

17:52.071 --> 17:54.156
If I turn Ramón in, will you kill us both?

17:56.575 --> 17:57.993
If you do what I want...

17:59.161 --> 18:00.829
you and your sister will be free,

18:00.913 --> 18:03.040
with enough money to go far away.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.169
The other option is...

18:07.252 --> 18:09.838
that neither of you make it
out of here alive.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.309
How do you want to do it?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.372
Where are you, bastard?

18:44.039 --> 18:47.709
<i>I'm sorry, boss, I had to come to</i>
<i>Mazatlán for a family emergency.</i>

18:47.793 --> 18:49.586
<i>But I have good news for you.</i>

18:51.130 --> 18:54.133
I was told Don Ismael is coming
to the Carnival in Mazatlán.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.302
He never misses it,
since it's in his turf...

18:58.053 --> 19:01.014
He feels safe.
Almost no one's with him.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.559
Is this information reliable?

19:04.768 --> 19:06.812
I've told Carlillos to wait there for me.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.983
Well, then just take him and Alambre

19:11.108 --> 19:12.734
so you won't catch much attention.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.611
Brother.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.992
Finish off that son of a bitch off.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.331
The police told me that...

19:26.456 --> 19:28.750
Ismael will be downtown in a few hours.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.796
They say he likes to go by foot.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.673
He has just two men with him.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.970
We'll go by car,
so they don't recognize us.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.139
We'll walk the last leg.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.850
I've studied the route.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.060
You follow us.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.353
No.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.356
I'll go with Alambre.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.775
You'll go ahead...

19:53.859 --> 19:54.776
paving our way.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.363
If things go sideways,
you'll cover our retreat.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.781
As you order, boss.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.038
Look...

20:08.207 --> 20:09.374
It's eager to shoot.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.901
Boss!

22:21.089 --> 22:22.507
Conrado?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.519
Ramón Avendaño just died in Mazatlán.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.650
I'm coming for the next one.

<i>I'm sorry, boss,</i>
<i>your brother is dead.</i>

23:23.110 --> 23:24.528
Son of a bitch.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.826
Motherfuckers!

23:30.951 --> 23:32.744
Come, sit here.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.579
No!

23:34.663 --> 23:36.665
Fucking bastards, no!

23:36.957 --> 23:38.416
With the president, please.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.460
This is Conrado Sol.

23:41.461 --> 23:44.965
No, this is confidential information,
I need to speak to him directly.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.802
Transfer him.

23:52.055 --> 23:56.017
I want to inform you first-hand that Ramón
Avendaño was just killed in Mazatlán.

23:56.768 --> 23:57.602
How do you know?

23:58.478 --> 24:00.355
I've told you I know how to do my job.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.440
<i>I'll give you an update on Bejamín soon.</i>

24:09.447 --> 24:13.618
Find out if Ramón Avendaño
has died in Mazatlán.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.120
I'll investigate now.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.167
If the news is confirmed,

24:20.250 --> 24:22.878
say it was a police operation.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.314
Ramón was killed.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.244
Good. Come back in ten days.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.672
"Chapito" is starting
to deliver on his promise.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.466
If they take out Benjamín,

25:09.549 --> 25:11.301
are we joining his association?

25:18.475 --> 25:20.143
Come in, Charalito.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.232
We're going to the Puebla house.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.695
Only you and the boys
can know we're going there.

25:33.740 --> 25:38.411
Tell Turco and Flaco not to come back
until they have killed that asshole.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.791

MEXICO

25:42.874 --> 25:44.459
We know you saw him.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.087
Tell us, or you're fucking dead.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.297
He was here a few days ago
to see his sister.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.101
Hello?

26:01.768 --> 26:03.520
It's good to hear you, Chapo.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.232
If we can find your number,
we can find you.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.693
Let's see who finds whom.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.664
Those bastards are getting on my nerves.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.084
Use your army contacts
to find out who they are.

26:39.139 --> 26:43.101
<i>By the way you're describing them,</i>
<i>they are special ops. Elite.</i>

26:43.643 --> 26:44.477
<i>Well-trained men.</i>

26:44.811 --> 26:47.063
-Captain.
-Antonio.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.108
-Take a seat.
<i>-Those are tight units.</i>

26:50.191 --> 26:52.819
Maximum ten men.
Impossible to break.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.448
I need their identities.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.452
Your request is not easy.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.831
If anyone can hunt the hunters, it's you.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.958
Get me their information.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.252
You know that when they feel thankful,

27:09.336 --> 27:11.963
my employers are very generous.

27:15.675 --> 27:18.845
BENJAMIN AVENDAÑO'S SAFE HOUSE
PUEBLA, MEXICO

29:07.287 --> 29:08.329
It's me.

29:19.799 --> 29:22.844
We're leaving on the next bus.
There are the tickets.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.147
Hey! Don't stand there!

29:35.064 --> 29:36.149
Don't stand there!

29:41.446 --> 29:43.156
You were followed. Go!

29:44.741 --> 29:46.201
Go!

30:29.911 --> 30:32.372
Sir... Ramón has been avenged.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.702
Easy.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.996
I just want to talk.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.672
You've got a beautiful family, Manuel.

31:26.676 --> 31:30.013
I was surprised to learn the pittance
they pay you for risking your life.

31:31.472 --> 31:32.473
If you die,

31:33.474 --> 31:35.602
your widow will get
a really shitty pension.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.814
That's not fair for your son, man.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.316
Neither is your low salary...

31:42.150 --> 31:45.612
Nor that you could die any given day,
leaving them helpless.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.282
Or am I wrong, ma'am?

31:51.659 --> 31:53.536
When you almost caught me in Tamazula,

31:54.120 --> 31:56.122
I wanted to shoot you in the head myself.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.376
But I acknowledge brave men.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.353
Ten thousand dollars a month.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.314
Against the fifteen hundred
the army pays you.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.274
Your job is the same,

32:23.441 --> 32:25.109
chasing the drug lords I tell you to.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.196
Not much different from
what you're doing now.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.616
The government has friends and enemies.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.619
And it only sends you after its enemies.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.622
You know that, right?

32:38.206 --> 32:40.667
If you convince your team,
I'll pay you double.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.795
Triple.

32:49.425 --> 32:50.677
What do you say, Manuel?

32:52.804 --> 32:55.390
Don't tell me your wife
has more balls than you.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.980
If what he said is true.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.733
We chase the current enemy,

33:05.817 --> 33:07.402
but the one they don't want us to touch...

33:08.194 --> 33:10.029
is given a blind eye.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.990
Let's just think about it...

33:13.324 --> 33:15.994
If they kill us,
our bosses won't give a shit.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.580
And our families will be left destitute.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.500
My loyalty is with my family.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.044
Not with the fucking bosses.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.005
I can't do it.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.009
My old man roll over in his grave
if they caught me.

33:32.218 --> 33:35.555
Go on with no problems, you're my
brothers, I'd never snitch on you.

33:36.639 --> 33:39.350
I only risk my life with you and for you.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.187
And I don't give a damn who the boss is.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.235
What do we have to do?

33:49.318 --> 33:50.945
Watch his back.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.906
And locate Benjamín Avendaño.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.202
<i>I received information that there is a man</i>

33:58.870 --> 34:00.872
<i>who runs Benjamín's errands.</i>

34:00.955 --> 34:02.498
<i>His nickname is Charalito.</i>

34:08.588 --> 34:12.175
Through money transactions,
we know he is in Puebla.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.349
We've got him.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.068
I have located Benjamín.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.196
You know my terms.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.825
The government must stop chasing me.

36:00.908 --> 36:03.619
But it must also stop
my extradition process.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.419
I kept my word once.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.046
And I'll keep it again.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.132
Don't let me down, Conrado.

36:22.263 --> 36:25.516
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE
MEXICO CITY

36:28.394 --> 36:31.564
I have the location to capture
Benjamín Avendaño.

36:31.981 --> 36:35.902
His capture would restore your office's
image after Chapo's escape.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.946
Are you sure it's from a reliable source?

36:39.197 --> 36:42.116
As much as the news of
Ramón Avendaño's assassination,

36:42.533 --> 36:46.495
which I reported directly to the President
before any of you found out.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.543
You want to get back your job in exchange.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.128
No.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.839
I want to be Operations Director
of Federal law enforcement.

36:58.424 --> 37:01.177
That position means I'll have
complete control.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.055
Without middlemen.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.309
I want...

37:09.227 --> 37:11.229
the name of your informant.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.232
In due time, Mr. President.

37:29.664 --> 37:33.084
-Welcome to the team.
-Thank you very much.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.297
A prompt statement by Santiago
to inform about my new office

37:38.381 --> 37:39.423
would be wise.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.176
So I can take over the operation.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.520
<i>First, let me clarify that this</i>

37:52.603 --> 37:54.605
<i>is no routine raid.</i>

37:55.022 --> 37:57.024
<i>We're facing the possibility</i>
<i>of capturing</i>

37:57.108 --> 37:59.944
<i>one of the most important</i>
<i>drug lords and criminals</i>

38:00.027 --> 38:02.029
<i>our nation has been chasing for years,</i>

38:02.571 --> 38:04.031
Benjamín Avendaño.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.450
We know about his hideout.

38:07.159 --> 38:10.371
<i>We are planning 11 strategic checkpoints</i>

38:10.454 --> 38:12.957
<i>so no one can leave the area.</i>

38:13.040 --> 38:15.710
<i>We don't how many hitmen</i>
<i>are protecting him,</i>

38:15.793 --> 38:17.503
<i>but the orders are clear,</i>

38:18.212 --> 38:19.505
capture him alive.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.219
<i>Today we have a new victory.</i>

39:07.303 --> 39:09.388
<i>After Ramón Avendaño's death</i>

39:09.472 --> 39:10.348
<i>a few days ago,</i>

39:13.809 --> 39:17.646
we have captured Benjamín Avendaño,
leader of the Tijuana cartel.

39:19.065 --> 39:22.151
The Operations Director
of the Federal Police,

39:22.234 --> 39:25.112
Mr. Conrado Sol, will give us details
of the apprehension.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.037
<i>Thanks to the intelligence work</i>
<i>of the Federal Police</i>

39:33.120 --> 39:35.081
<i>and the Army,</i>

39:35.164 --> 39:37.792
without a single shot fired,

39:37.875 --> 39:40.836
we've captured the head
of the Tijuana cartel.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.506
Now, we'll show you the capture.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.462
Thank you...

40:24.880 --> 40:26.841
Fucking Chapo.

40:36.934 --> 40:37.893
Hello?

40:38.519 --> 40:42.314
Joaquín.
You're just about a free man now.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.485
<i>The government will no longer chase you.</i>

40:46.569 --> 40:48.529
<i>And the extradition process</i>
<i>has been shelved.</i>

40:49.655 --> 40:51.282
The only thing I ask...

40:52.783 --> 40:55.244
is to toss me a treat
every now and then,

40:55.327 --> 40:56.370
for the media.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.499
<i>A shipment, or someone to capture.</i>

41:01.333 --> 41:04.545
We have to maintain the image
that we're still after you.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.088
<i>You got it.</i>

41:06.881 --> 41:08.090
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

41:09.967 --> 41:11.135
Toño...

41:14.013 --> 41:15.306
It's time to go back home.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.225
Yes, sir.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.170
Now that the Avendaños are finished,

41:46.921 --> 41:48.255
Don Joaquín wants your blessing.

41:49.256 --> 41:51.300
So that he and his partners
may work at ease.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.929
Control and profit, like the old times.

42:05.564 --> 42:08.025
ARTURO BERNAL LEYDA'S RESIDENCE
CULIACÁN, SINALOA

42:14.782 --> 42:17.076
-Did everyone come?
-Almost everyone.

42:24.458 --> 42:25.626
I kept my word.

42:27.086 --> 42:29.255
I took the Avendaños down.

42:29.797 --> 42:32.925
And now we have the Mexican government
and the DEA on our side.

42:34.426 --> 42:36.595
It's time to create the federation.
Cheers!

42:37.346 --> 42:38.389
Cheers!

42:45.479 --> 42:47.022
Those who are not with us,

42:47.898 --> 42:49.316
are against us.

42:51.235 --> 42:53.612
We cannot tolerate contempt.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.908
And that is what Raciel
showed by not showing up.

42:59.159 --> 43:02.288
That is why our first team operation
will be to destroy him...

43:03.872 --> 43:05.124
and his organization.
