01:06.019 --> 01:09.189
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty
relay Combat Control commands.

01:09.356 --> 01:10.774
Roger, Talon 1.

01:10.941 --> 01:12.401
Central Prime is transmitting...

01:12.568 --> 01:14.945
...encrypted satellite
auto-terrain comparison.

01:15.112 --> 01:16.822
Talons, this is Operator.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.283
PAYCOM has given
his final tasking orders.

01:19.783 --> 01:23.745
You are to proceed to target
and prosecute with precision.

01:23.912 --> 01:26.456
Now, remember,
you are pilots of the U.S. Navy.

01:26.623 --> 01:29.793
I expect nothing less
than perfection.

01:30.168 --> 01:32.671
Roger, skipper.
Activating tactical music.

01:32.838 --> 01:35.716
Countermeasure is silent party.
Talon 2, confirm.

01:36.049 --> 01:37.593
Talon 2 confirms. Music on.

01:37.801 --> 01:39.970
Risk assessment is
we have a clean mission status.

01:40.137 --> 01:41.597
Attack commencing.

01:53.567 --> 01:54.985
Gotcha.

02:06.830 --> 02:08.916
Missile lock. Missile lock.

02:09.208 --> 02:12.669
Talon 3, there's a SAM site on
the west wall. We got birds in the air.

02:26.350 --> 02:28.310
Talon 2,
the SAM site's been erased.

02:28.518 --> 02:30.604
Now, that's how you do it.

02:55.629 --> 02:57.172
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!

02:57.631 --> 03:00.175
Talon 1, I expect
the same out of you.

03:16.024 --> 03:19.194
Arming Blue Ferret
for penetration detonation.

03:20.904 --> 03:22.698
Missile armed. Missile armed.

04:00.944 --> 04:03.614
Yep, 100 over 100.
That's correct.

04:04.031 --> 04:05.866
And I can rely on these numbers?

04:06.033 --> 04:10.579
Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray.
You either score or you don't.

04:10.746 --> 04:12.706
National Command Authority's
duly impressed.

04:12.873 --> 04:14.958
They've given us the go-ahead
on phase two.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.375
You know what?

04:16.543 --> 04:20.130
You should come to D.C. and make
the presentation to the senators.

04:20.672 --> 04:23.008
That's how Admiral Rickover
got things done.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.135
Admiral. You get my meaning?

04:25.302 --> 04:28.180
No, I'm flattered,
but you do the lobbying.

04:28.388 --> 04:29.973
Politics is for politicians.

04:31.183 --> 04:34.019
- Captain?
- I'll get back to you.

04:34.895 --> 04:36.480
There's Popsicles in the cooler.

04:36.688 --> 04:38.148
- Got any grape?
- Any grape?

04:39.524 --> 04:42.569
I believe there is one left,
and don't lose your dignity.

04:42.736 --> 04:44.071
Oh, thank you.

04:45.030 --> 04:47.574
- All right, take a seat.
- Nice catch.

04:47.741 --> 04:51.286
Talk to me. Where are the holes?
How can we improve?

04:51.453 --> 04:53.330
Come on. I'm not a patient man.

04:53.497 --> 04:56.375
Sorry, I got caught up on
that west wall. I had to pull out...

04:56.542 --> 04:58.877
War is a team sport.

04:59.044 --> 05:02.381
Those AAA sites were thick.
Gave extra time to the SAM sites.

05:02.548 --> 05:05.509
See, that's your answer. There really
was no room for improvement.

05:05.676 --> 05:08.011
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade
did was right.

05:08.178 --> 05:11.098
She took out their communications
and exposed their SAM sites...

05:11.265 --> 05:13.433
...so Henry could lay it down.
- That's what I do.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.395
- I mean, it was perfect.
- "Perfect." I'll go along with that.

05:16.562 --> 05:20.315
Much as I hate to see that smile
of yours get any smugger.

05:20.816 --> 05:22.150
You blushing?

05:23.735 --> 05:25.195
I've got good news.

05:25.362 --> 05:27.614
Tell us we got a carrier,
skipper, come on.

05:27.781 --> 05:28.866
Affirmative.

05:29.032 --> 05:30.826
The USS Abraham Lincoln.

05:31.451 --> 05:33.871
Captain's an old classmate of mine,
Dick Marshfield.

05:34.037 --> 05:37.374
- I believe you two know each other.
- He was the captain I told you about.

05:37.541 --> 05:41.086
- Hell of a pilot in his day.
- He's black too. He's black.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.006
I'm also gonna be expanding
your squadron.

05:44.965 --> 05:47.509
On the carrier, you'll be joined
by a new wingman.

05:48.427 --> 05:50.470
A fourth wingman?

05:50.637 --> 05:54.099
Wait, I thought there were only
three Talons in existence.

05:54.308 --> 05:57.728
What is the problem, Purcell?
You look like you been hit in the gut.

05:57.895 --> 06:01.273
For one, captain, we've been flying
together for a long time and it's good.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.774
And four is an unlucky number.

06:04.443 --> 06:05.944
- Unlucky?
- It's not a prime number.

06:06.153 --> 06:08.530
Prime numbers can only be divided
by one or itself.

06:08.697 --> 06:10.199
Three is prime. The Holy Trinity.

06:10.365 --> 06:13.035
Thesis and antithesis come together
and form the synthesis...

06:13.202 --> 06:16.997
This is not a seminar on metaphysics.
This is the U.S. Navy.

06:17.206 --> 06:21.960
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500.
Dismissed.

06:22.127 --> 06:24.463
Okay. If he'd let me finish,
I was gonna say...

06:24.630 --> 06:28.425
...Three's Company, Three Stooges,
Three Musketeers, three-peat...

06:28.592 --> 06:30.928
..."three strikes, you're out,"
"Three Times a Lady."

06:31.094 --> 06:32.679
- Three dimensions.
- Three blind mice.

06:32.888 --> 06:35.515
There's ménage à trois.
Don't forget that one.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.811
To the original three.

06:39.978 --> 06:41.647
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

06:41.813 --> 06:44.066
- Cheers.
- And assorted guests.

06:44.233 --> 06:45.400
Cheers.

07:03.001 --> 07:05.212
I'll be back in a second.

07:06.672 --> 07:08.799
I gotta go pee-pee.

07:09.841 --> 07:10.968
That's nasty.

07:15.973 --> 07:18.100
At least she's potty-trained.
I'll give her that.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.852
- Chip O'Dell.
- No way.

07:21.019 --> 07:24.273
Yeah, it's gotta be him. Hey, Henry,
our fourth wing. It's gotta be him.

07:24.439 --> 07:27.526
He tried to manipulate his way into
the program, but you two beat him.

07:27.693 --> 07:31.238
Yeah, but Becky Martinez
could fly circles around O'Dell.

07:31.405 --> 07:34.241
- Two out of the four are women? No.
- Hey, you never know.

07:34.408 --> 07:37.703
- God, you're such a chauvinist.
- Hold on, now, that's not true.

07:37.870 --> 07:42.165
I bow down before the superiority
of the opposite sex in many respects.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.625
But from time to time...

07:43.917 --> 07:45.836
...I believe they should
bow down before me.

07:46.003 --> 07:49.298
- Oh, please.
- Kara. Kara, listen. You're different.

07:49.506 --> 07:51.592
- You are a singularity.
- Absolutely.

07:51.758 --> 07:53.510
You're a freak. Of nature.

07:53.677 --> 07:56.680
- Well, thank you, Henry, I think.
- You are very welcome.

07:57.222 --> 07:59.141
You know what I think?

08:00.017 --> 08:02.603
Don't think. Drink.

08:47.522 --> 08:49.024
Have fun.

10:14.735 --> 10:17.029
Spectacular night, huh?

10:17.571 --> 10:21.200
- Dark and mysterious, sir.
- Don't you like surprises, Ben?

10:26.538 --> 10:28.207
Well, here he comes now.

10:52.105 --> 10:54.608
Meet your new wingman.

11:07.496 --> 11:11.083
Allow me to introduce the future
of digital warfare. Tim?

11:14.711 --> 11:17.172
Open for Tim, please.

11:23.095 --> 11:26.265
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.

11:26.431 --> 11:29.101
Exoskeleton,
metal-ceramic composite.

11:29.268 --> 11:31.520
Aeroelastic wings.

11:31.687 --> 11:36.316
Pulse detonation engine
with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.

11:36.483 --> 11:40.112
EDI's sensors can pick out
a face five miles away.

11:40.279 --> 11:44.157
So we'll take three. Drop the top
on mine, personalized license plate.

11:44.324 --> 11:46.451
So this is one of these
smart UCAVs.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.955
Well, technically you could call it
an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.

11:50.122 --> 11:52.499
But that would be like
calling this carrier a rowboat.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.835
I feel you, captain.
I know a bit about this.

11:55.002 --> 11:58.463
- This is quantum processing, right?
- Yeah, it's the first tested application.

11:58.672 --> 11:59.965
Ten terabits a second.

12:00.132 --> 12:02.676
So if it's a UCAV,
why does it have a seat?

12:02.885 --> 12:04.970
The cockpit's just
for testing and maintenance.

12:05.137 --> 12:07.347
Otherwise, EDI flies all by himself.

12:07.806 --> 12:10.058
You mean "itself," don't you, sir?

12:10.225 --> 12:14.187
So this is what the fuss is all about.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.816
You're looking
at VLO stealth, captain.

12:17.983 --> 12:19.943
It's got a brain
like a quantum sponge.

12:20.110 --> 12:23.906
And one day, its survivability
is going to fly right off the charts.

12:24.072 --> 12:26.533
- Lieutenant Wade.
- It's good to meet you, sir.

12:27.326 --> 12:29.912
It is a bag of chips, all right.

12:31.747 --> 12:34.166
- Lieutenant Purcell.
- Honored to meet you, sir.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.460
It will replace us all.

12:37.044 --> 12:39.838
Looks and sounds
like science fiction, George.

12:40.005 --> 12:42.090
Well, so did everything,
once upon a time.

12:42.257 --> 12:44.176
Ain't that the truth.

12:44.593 --> 12:46.595
Mr. Gannon.
Good to have you back.

12:47.262 --> 12:51.016
Your first squadron tour still holds
some of the ship's most...

12:51.183 --> 12:52.893
...impressive records.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.854
Thank you, Captain Marshfield.
Records are made to be broken.

12:56.021 --> 12:58.732
Rules too, if I remember
your philosophy.

12:58.899 --> 13:01.610
Captain Cummings,
this is my X O, Mr. Carlson.

13:01.818 --> 13:03.070
Carlson.

13:03.237 --> 13:06.156
Why don't you meet me up on
the flight deck after you're through.

13:06.323 --> 13:07.908
- You bet.
- Congratulations, George.

13:08.116 --> 13:10.369
- Thank you.
- Good to see you again, Dick.

13:10.536 --> 13:11.745
You too.

13:11.912 --> 13:14.623
- It's humming.
- No, EDI's thinking.

13:14.790 --> 13:18.210
- Thinking? Thinking about what, sir?
- You. All of you.

13:18.377 --> 13:22.130
He's going over your files.
He's reviewing all your flight logs.

13:22.297 --> 13:24.258
Let's take it for a spin,
see what it can do.

13:24.466 --> 13:26.260
No, no, no. Tomorrow.

13:26.426 --> 13:29.179
- First, you gotta do your homework.
- Homework?

13:31.974 --> 13:34.393
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:35.769 --> 13:39.356
"EDI UCAV. Extreme Deep Invader."

13:39.690 --> 13:41.817
Yeah, I've been called that
a few times.

13:41.984 --> 13:43.527
- I've heard that one.
- Yeah, right.

13:57.124 --> 13:59.459
Well, hello, gorgeous.

14:21.815 --> 14:25.444
Please, no pictures, please.
No pictures, please. Please.

14:25.611 --> 14:29.114
Okay, take them.
Take them. Take them.

14:36.622 --> 14:38.081
It's open.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.334
Study break.

14:42.711 --> 14:45.088
You are one big study break.

14:45.297 --> 14:46.632
Just a natural.

14:47.633 --> 14:49.176
So that is the appeal.

14:49.343 --> 14:51.803
Okay, because I was really
wondering how you manage...

14:51.970 --> 14:54.556
...to pull a rocket scientist
at every port.

14:55.182 --> 14:58.936
You better be careful, Ben, you know.
Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.

14:59.144 --> 15:00.979
Well, I'm not a rat.
That's my appeal.

15:03.482 --> 15:05.817
- You checking out the drone?
- Yeah.

15:05.984 --> 15:08.362
Just barely skimmed the surface.

15:08.987 --> 15:12.241
- We really are in the era of EDI.
- EDI.

15:12.991 --> 15:15.577
Did I ever tell you
about that foster mother I had?

15:15.744 --> 15:18.789
- The one who weighed 350 pounds?
- No.

15:18.997 --> 15:22.918
Anyway, one day she comes home
with this Chihuahua, right?

15:23.085 --> 15:25.295
Guess what she named him. Eddie.

15:25.504 --> 15:28.715
- You know what I realized about you?
- What?

15:28.882 --> 15:31.176
You got a foster mom
for every situation.

15:31.343 --> 15:34.221
Hey, I lived through my childhood.
I may as well use it, right?

15:34.388 --> 15:35.973
That's right.

15:40.644 --> 15:42.938
So tell me, you think
Marshfield's right?

15:43.105 --> 15:45.649
You think they're gonna trade us all in
for that machine?

15:45.857 --> 15:49.653
No way. War is about tools.
Think about it.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.697
Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.

15:51.905 --> 15:54.908
- Best guy with the best weapon wins.
- Or girl.

15:55.075 --> 15:57.703
And we all know who that is,
don't we?

16:00.163 --> 16:04.209
The dull thud
of a Ben Gannon compliment.

16:12.718 --> 16:14.011
Well...

16:14.177 --> 16:16.597
Oh, pardon my C cup.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.810
Study break is over.

16:35.449 --> 16:37.868
Good morning to the crew
of the USS Abraham Lincoln.

16:38.035 --> 16:40.454
Remember, foreign-object debris
can ruin a jet engine.

16:40.621 --> 16:43.290
Let's keep our safety record.
Scour that deck.

16:43.457 --> 16:47.461
Hey. Feel like we got older, Dick.
What the hell happened?

16:47.628 --> 16:49.546
Don't complain.
You still got your hair.

16:49.713 --> 16:52.049
Yeah. Some of it.

16:54.009 --> 16:56.220
Look, truth be told...

16:57.387 --> 17:01.642
...I never wanted this little experiment
of yours on my ship.

17:02.434 --> 17:04.519
Well, you're not
hurting my feelings, Dick.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.980
Admiral Spelling shared
your point paper with me...

17:07.146 --> 17:09.233
...and your objections
were duly noted.

17:09.398 --> 17:13.487
- You always could work the politics.
- It's indispensable in a bureaucracy.

17:13.654 --> 17:16.406
This isn't a bureaucracy,
not out here.

17:16.573 --> 17:18.825
You rush a weapons system
into service...

17:18.992 --> 17:22.829
...you shortcut an operational
test cycle, people might get killed.

17:22.996 --> 17:26.833
You know I can't pick my nose here
without 7000 people approving it.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.835
Nobody rushed a damn thing.

17:29.211 --> 17:31.630
Program is just ahead of schedule.

17:34.383 --> 17:36.176
You missed this.

17:39.888 --> 17:41.515
I'm out first, boys.

17:41.682 --> 17:43.517
I'm right on that ass.

17:44.476 --> 17:46.603
After you, ladies.

18:18.969 --> 18:20.679
Talon 2, airborne.

18:24.308 --> 18:26.977
Talon 3, airborne.

18:32.316 --> 18:35.152
Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.

18:35.319 --> 18:37.404
Deploying Unmanned Combat
Aerial Vehicle...

18:37.613 --> 18:39.239
...Extreme Deep Invader now.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.461
I never thought
we would see this day.

18:52.628 --> 18:54.171
Me neither, sir.

19:12.898 --> 19:15.192
UCAV EDI, you have launch.

19:47.224 --> 19:49.351
One to UCAV.
Confirm flight link. Over.

19:50.435 --> 19:52.813
Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.

19:52.980 --> 19:55.691
It is good to be
part of the squadron.

19:55.857 --> 19:58.485
What? Well, well, well. He can talk.

19:58.652 --> 20:02.322
Big deal. I know a guy's BMW,
does exactly the same thing.

20:16.795 --> 20:18.046
Picture, please.

20:19.047 --> 20:20.799
Aye, aye, sir.

20:23.302 --> 20:24.970
Swarm logic activated.

20:26.221 --> 20:29.349
All right, Ben.
EDI's here to learn from you.

20:29.516 --> 20:32.769
So let's make sure these lessons
are up to speed, all right?

20:33.270 --> 20:36.023
Well, then, let the schooling begin.

20:44.865 --> 20:46.700
Captain Cummings.

20:51.580 --> 20:53.040
Inside, please.

20:53.498 --> 20:56.460
- What's the deal?
- You, sir, have a new tasking order.

21:00.923 --> 21:03.342
One to wing, anybody got a visual
on the UCAV?

21:05.677 --> 21:07.179
- Negative, 1.
- Negative, 1.

21:07.346 --> 21:08.847
We better find him and regroup.

21:09.014 --> 21:11.099
Before it takes a crap
in its quantum pants.

21:11.266 --> 21:12.476
Wait up. Hold on.

21:13.018 --> 21:14.811
What the hell is he doing?

21:14.978 --> 21:17.356
Here he comes. Here he comes.

21:17.522 --> 21:20.275
I think little brother
is messing with us.

21:22.361 --> 21:25.739
UCAV, your position is always
on my starboard side.

21:25.906 --> 21:28.283
Other starboard.

21:38.585 --> 21:39.795
That's hot.

21:40.170 --> 21:43.674
Got no heart, but it sure can fly.
That's not bad for a tin man.

21:43.840 --> 21:48.720
EDI, it's official. You got a call sign.
UCAV "Tin Man" EDI, the first.

21:56.979 --> 21:59.106
- Operator to squadron.
- Go for Talons.

21:59.273 --> 22:01.441
There's been a change of plans.

22:01.608 --> 22:04.903
We're giving you an emergency
mission redirect. Repeat.

22:05.070 --> 22:07.364
That's an emergency redirect.
Do you read me?

22:07.531 --> 22:09.074
Roger. Where's the fire, skipper?

22:09.283 --> 22:12.411
PAYCOM has given us
a brand-new tasking order.

22:12.578 --> 22:14.413
Please access your encrypted file...

22:14.580 --> 22:17.708
...named "Advanced
War Vector Scenarios."

22:18.959 --> 22:20.335
File's open. Go ahead.

22:20.502 --> 22:24.339
All right. Firewall code
is "Terror Summit."

22:24.506 --> 22:29.177
We are upgrading this file from
a scenario to a tactical action plan.

22:29.344 --> 22:31.054
Repeat, we are upgrading the file.

22:32.639 --> 22:36.810
CIA human intel has just learned
that the heads of three terrorist cells...

22:36.977 --> 22:40.105
...are about to meet in 24 minutes.

22:40.814 --> 22:44.026
The country is Myanmar.
The city is Rangoon.

22:44.193 --> 22:46.445
They're planning an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.

22:46.945 --> 22:48.989
One to Control,
what about the UCAV?

22:51.992 --> 22:54.286
EDI will observe your attack.

22:54.661 --> 22:56.663
Proceed to primary.

22:57.289 --> 22:58.999
Roger.

22:59.166 --> 23:03.253
One to UCA V,
confirm observation status only.

23:04.504 --> 23:07.466
Tin Man confirms, Talon 1.

23:08.717 --> 23:11.345
New coordinates
have been uploaded.

23:14.056 --> 23:16.183
Baptism by fire, Tin Man.

23:26.151 --> 23:28.028
Mach 1.

23:29.071 --> 23:30.906
Mach 2.

23:31.907 --> 23:33.909
Mach 3.

23:34.618 --> 23:36.870
Mach 4.

23:40.582 --> 23:43.669
Primo's now analyzing the location.
Here we go.

23:45.212 --> 23:47.130
The primary is this building.

23:47.756 --> 23:50.717
A new defense ministry
still under construction.

23:50.884 --> 23:55.347
Specs indicate
14-foot-thick cement roof...

23:55.514 --> 23:57.683
...with steel reinforcements.

23:57.849 --> 24:00.185
Roger. We're not weaponized
for something that thick.

24:00.352 --> 24:01.853
Repeat, not weaponized.

24:02.020 --> 24:04.565
This is 2. What's the population
of the collateral area?

24:07.025 --> 24:10.737
The building's unoccupied, but it's
in the middle of downtown Rangoon.

24:10.904 --> 24:12.739
This is 3.
Talk to me about that roof.

24:12.906 --> 24:15.033
What's Primo advocate
to ordinance and influence?

24:15.200 --> 24:17.035
Primo says Talons
can't penetrate it.

24:17.202 --> 24:21.081
This is our chance. We may never
catch these bastards together again.

24:21.248 --> 24:23.250
Try a lateral vector.

24:24.751 --> 24:27.045
Just do what he says.

24:28.839 --> 24:31.466
This is 2 to Control.
Risk assessment officer advises...

24:31.675 --> 24:33.969
...casualties from lateral vector
will be in the thousands.

25:08.420 --> 25:11.840
Tin Man has integrated
all network-centric spy satellites.

25:12.007 --> 25:13.383
Here is new data.

25:14.051 --> 25:18.388
UCAV is bypassing Central Prime.
He's distributing secure video stream.

25:50.963 --> 25:54.424
Look at that. Oh, yeah. Oh, now
I know what I want for Christmas.

25:54.591 --> 25:56.718
One to Control, we've entered
our mission window.

25:56.885 --> 25:58.762
Six-three seconds
to primary and counting.

25:58.929 --> 26:00.764
Come on, Control,
we have our targets.

26:00.931 --> 26:05.269
Come on. I need an alternative.
We got these guys in the bull's-eye.

26:05.435 --> 26:08.188
There is an alternative,
Combat Control.

26:10.315 --> 26:13.110
Operator to UCAV. Talk to me.
Give me something.

26:13.777 --> 26:16.864
Squadron carries
truncheon implosion bombs.

26:17.656 --> 26:19.241
Negative, will not work.

26:19.408 --> 26:23.287
Central Prime says truncheons
can't achieve velocity for penetration.

26:23.453 --> 26:26.999
One to UCAV, 37 seconds to primary.
Come on, explain.

26:27.165 --> 26:31.253
Diving dead vertical at 2070 knots
will increase truncheon velocity.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.672
Bomb will successfully
penetrate roof.

26:33.839 --> 26:36.049
What's the blackout risk
at vertical 2070?

26:36.216 --> 26:39.845
- Seventy-three percent.
- Time on target is 23 seconds.

26:40.012 --> 26:43.348
- Call it off. It's not worth the risk.
- Operator to Talons, pull back.

26:43.515 --> 26:45.350
- EDI will plant the truncheon.
- Captain.

26:45.517 --> 26:47.853
This is what we built
this machine for.

26:48.020 --> 26:51.773
There's no blood in those
quantum veins. It can't black out.

26:51.940 --> 26:56.320
Operator to Talons, repeat,
EDI will plant the truncheon.

26:56.486 --> 26:59.907
Control, negative, Control.
Mission critical. One will prosecute.

27:00.073 --> 27:01.658
This is 3 to 1. I got your back...

27:01.825 --> 27:04.119
...but if you black out,
you're gonna kill everyone.

27:04.286 --> 27:07.789
Negative, 3. I did not get this far
by being in the 73rd percentile.

27:08.248 --> 27:09.625
I like my odds.

27:09.791 --> 27:12.794
Talon 1, your orders
are to stand down.

27:12.961 --> 27:14.880
- Do you read me, lieutenant?
- I do...

27:17.299 --> 27:18.967
- Talon 1, stand down.
- I'm having...

27:19.134 --> 27:20.552
Can you...? Can you...?

27:25.265 --> 27:27.059
Go, baby, go.

28:14.314 --> 28:17.109
One hundred knots
to release velocity.

28:23.365 --> 28:24.950
Fifty knots to release velocity.

28:31.206 --> 28:32.791
His BP is spiking, sir.

28:35.878 --> 28:37.754
Release velocity attained.

28:37.921 --> 28:39.339
Truncheon away.

28:55.689 --> 28:58.525
Ten seconds to implosion.

28:58.734 --> 29:01.486
Nine, eight...

29:01.653 --> 29:04.156
...seven, six...

29:04.907 --> 29:09.328
...five, four, three...

29:09.494 --> 29:12.122
...two, one.

29:38.982 --> 29:42.986
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we
lost radio contact for a second there.

29:43.153 --> 29:46.532
There you go. I wasn't worried, baby.
I wasn't worried.

29:46.698 --> 29:50.118
Activating swarm logic,
going full-stealth egress.

29:50.494 --> 29:53.956
Roger, Talon 1. Full-stealth egress.
Swarm logic is on.

29:54.414 --> 29:56.959
Battle damage assessment,
100 over 100.

29:57.125 --> 29:59.753
Collateral damage, zero.

30:13.559 --> 30:15.060
Let's go home.

30:15.852 --> 30:17.354
Going hypersonic.

30:21.984 --> 30:23.861
Same old Ben.

30:24.820 --> 30:26.154
Yep.

30:26.780 --> 30:28.490
Oh, and, George...

30:29.324 --> 30:31.326
...hell of a first mission.

30:31.535 --> 30:33.287
Thank you, captain.

30:35.706 --> 30:37.499
On my way to the bridge.

30:42.170 --> 30:44.131
Talon 2 and 3 are on deck.

30:44.298 --> 30:47.718
Talon 1 and UCAV EDI
are on approach.

30:48.343 --> 30:51.054
Roger, Control. UCAV will go first.
I'll take the last trap.

30:51.221 --> 30:52.973
UCAV, confirm you've got the ball.

30:53.390 --> 30:56.518
Confirmed, Talon 1.
Tin Man will land next.

31:14.119 --> 31:17.039
Okay, 1 to Control,
we've had a lightning strike.

31:17.206 --> 31:19.124
The UCAV's very unstable.

31:19.291 --> 31:21.418
Landing sequence is altered.
I'll go in first...

31:21.585 --> 31:24.087
...but the UCAV
is gonna need the net.

31:36.642 --> 31:38.018
Nice landing, ma'am.

31:38.185 --> 31:41.772
On the flight deck,
stand by to rig barricade.

31:48.111 --> 31:51.740
Extreme Deep Invader aircraft
inbound for crash landing.

32:00.666 --> 32:03.669
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

32:03.835 --> 32:06.922
- Hold on! Stop! Stop.
- Stay low, stay low! Pull low!

32:13.470 --> 32:15.806
Pull starboard! Pull starboard!

32:30.904 --> 32:32.239
Clear the deck!

32:32.406 --> 32:34.491
Move it! Move it! Move it!

33:04.980 --> 33:08.192
- You scared me.
- Sorry, just a bit restless.

33:08.609 --> 33:12.446
Really got whacked tonight, right?
Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.

33:12.613 --> 33:15.115
Oh, he can't hear you.
I pulled his voice recog.

33:15.282 --> 33:19.369
I'll call it a "he" when it gets out of its
cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?

33:21.205 --> 33:23.457
- You all right?
- Yeah.

33:23.790 --> 33:27.336
It's just a power surge, that's all.

33:27.502 --> 33:30.589
- And that's normal?
- Normal?

33:31.298 --> 33:33.634
Let me show you something.

33:41.308 --> 33:43.977
That was EDI's neural network.

33:44.520 --> 33:48.524
Now, check this out.

33:51.026 --> 33:55.239
I mean, ever since the lightning strike,
he's just been writing all of this...

33:55.405 --> 33:57.866
I don't know. A language or a code.

33:58.033 --> 34:00.118
And what does it mean?

34:00.494 --> 34:02.204
Yeah. "Mean."

34:02.371 --> 34:04.790
The person that could really
answer that question...

34:04.957 --> 34:07.459
...is its designer, Keith Orbit.
- Orbit?

34:07.626 --> 34:10.963
- The guy's name is Orbit?
- Yeah, I know.

34:11.129 --> 34:14.466
He did all the Al on the Raptor
when he was 22...

34:14.632 --> 34:18.637
...and I guess, after that, he decided
that his given name was too earthly.

34:22.474 --> 34:24.893
Off for Tim, please.

34:25.060 --> 34:27.603
At least it's a good song.

34:28.938 --> 34:33.068
He downloads songs from the Web.

34:33.277 --> 34:34.862
Yeah? How many?

34:37.781 --> 34:39.867
All of them.

34:42.744 --> 34:45.746
You're in a peck of trouble
with the record companies there, son.

34:47.248 --> 34:48.833
Ben, could...?

34:53.964 --> 34:57.551
I saw how serious
that shit is up there.

34:57.718 --> 35:02.806
So I think it's only fair that I tell you
that EDI's been designed to evolve.

35:02.973 --> 35:06.727
- It's just unpredictable...
- Let me ask you something.

35:06.935 --> 35:12.566
Just between you and me,
do you have confidence in this plane?

35:15.444 --> 35:17.613
There's your answer.

35:20.657 --> 35:22.242
It's open.

35:24.411 --> 35:25.871
Have a seat.

35:26.038 --> 35:29.082
"Waffle" for 15 points.
I'm kicking your ass, buddy.

35:29.291 --> 35:31.084
You didn't cheat, did you?

35:31.251 --> 35:34.254
Cheating's not part
of my vocabulary.

35:34.796 --> 35:37.633
Listen, I scheduled your jet
for a little maintenance.

35:37.799 --> 35:41.053
I gotta get the bugs out of that radio,
don't you think?

35:41.220 --> 35:43.555
It was a difficult situation
and I made a decision.

35:43.722 --> 35:45.265
You made a mistake, Ben.

35:45.474 --> 35:47.851
Sir, there's a thin line
between insubordination and...

35:48.018 --> 35:50.312
No, no, no,
that's not the mistake you made.

35:50.479 --> 35:53.565
Your mistake was getting competitive
with a machine.

35:53.732 --> 35:55.984
I'm the point of the sword
up there, sir.

35:56.151 --> 35:58.320
And I pulled it off, 100 over 100.

35:58.529 --> 36:02.449
Yes, indeedy, and I congratulate you.
Calls have been coming in all night.

36:02.616 --> 36:05.202
But that doesn't change the issue.

36:05.369 --> 36:06.662
What is the issue, then?

36:06.828 --> 36:08.705
- Would you like a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

36:08.872 --> 36:11.166
- You sure?
- Fine, thank you.

36:11.333 --> 36:13.669
Rolled on the thighs
of mulatto women.

36:17.673 --> 36:19.341
What are you afraid of, Ben?

36:19.550 --> 36:21.843
Being replaced? Is that it?

36:22.010 --> 36:24.012
You afraid EDI's
gonna take your job?

36:24.179 --> 36:26.473
No. No, to be honest with you...

36:26.640 --> 36:30.352
...I just don't think war should become
some kind of video game.

36:31.728 --> 36:34.314
And how do you feel
about black body bags?

36:34.481 --> 36:37.192
What am I supposed to tell
all the weeping mothers?

36:37.401 --> 36:40.362
We could've got the job done
without sacrificing their children...

36:40.529 --> 36:43.031
...but no, we decided not to
because of what?

36:43.240 --> 36:44.950
- Tradition?
- Not tradition, it's...

36:45.117 --> 36:48.120
Look, we have things
those computers can never have...

36:48.287 --> 36:51.164
...like instincts and feelings
and moral judgment.

36:51.331 --> 36:54.293
You can call me old-fashioned,
you can call it whatever you want...

36:54.459 --> 36:56.545
...but I just don't think that in war...

36:56.753 --> 37:00.048
...the action should ever be divorced
from the consequences.

37:00.215 --> 37:02.217
You don't think I consider
the consequences...

37:02.426 --> 37:05.095
...every time I send you up there
with bombs?

37:05.596 --> 37:07.806
- I know you do, sir.
- I've dedicated my life...

37:07.973 --> 37:09.558
...to considering the consequences.

37:11.602 --> 37:14.271
I got a bad feeling about this plane.

37:14.730 --> 37:16.982
I don't know, I think it needs more...

37:17.149 --> 37:20.944
I don't know, trials before it's ever
put in a combat situation again.

37:21.111 --> 37:22.738
You been talking to Marshfield?

37:23.614 --> 37:27.159
- Sir, you're my commanding officer.
- That's right.

37:27.993 --> 37:32.039
And I guarantee you this thing will be
100 percent before I risk it in the field.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.124
Look, Ben...

37:34.333 --> 37:38.253
...all we need is
one more successful mission...

37:38.462 --> 37:41.465
...and this project will be out of
the stovepipe and into the light.

37:42.549 --> 37:44.343
Are you with me on this?

37:44.509 --> 37:47.554
- I'm here to make it happen, sir.
- All right.

37:47.721 --> 37:51.308
I've arranged a little R and R for you
and your team. You've earned it.

37:51.475 --> 37:52.684
Thailand maybe.

37:53.101 --> 37:54.937
We just got here.

37:55.729 --> 37:59.024
Yeah, but this could turn out
to be a long tour.

37:59.191 --> 38:04.321
You better take it while you can get it.
We'll pick this up when you get back.

39:02.921 --> 39:04.756
Hey, how you doing? Henry Purcell.

39:04.965 --> 39:09.428
I'm from America. Look, I fly jets.
You like to go fast?

40:14.409 --> 40:17.037
- B, it's the future and it works.
- I don't think it works.

40:17.204 --> 40:18.664
It's just technology.

40:18.830 --> 40:21.959
You know, it's here to make me safe.
It keeps me alive.

40:22.125 --> 40:23.377
EDI is no different.

40:23.544 --> 40:25.837
- You think it keeps you safe?
- Yeah. He's here...

40:26.004 --> 40:27.881
...to help me get the job done...

40:28.048 --> 40:29.841
...keep me in one piece...

40:30.008 --> 40:31.927
...so I can visit my folks
for Thanksgiving.

40:33.095 --> 40:34.888
Anyway, our safety's not the point.

40:35.055 --> 40:38.475
War's meant to be terrible. If it stops
being terrible, what's gonna stop us?

40:38.642 --> 40:41.270
It's become some kind of sport.
Just send in the EDls.

40:41.937 --> 40:43.438
Yeah, but it's neutral.

40:43.605 --> 40:45.983
- What?
- I mean, EDI...

40:46.149 --> 40:49.695
...if it's controlled by moral people,
then it'll be moral.

40:49.987 --> 40:51.655
Oh, I know I'm not moral.

40:51.822 --> 40:55.284
As a matter of fact, I should be
arrested for the thoughts I have now.

40:58.036 --> 40:59.788
I say something?

41:00.956 --> 41:05.002
Well, you boys will have to excuse me.
I have to go pee-pee.

41:07.212 --> 41:09.673
- Do you wanna go?
- Okay.

41:19.683 --> 41:22.352
- What?
- You know what.

41:24.521 --> 41:26.064
Take it easy. Nothing's happened.

41:26.231 --> 41:29.276
No, something's happened.
You just ain't done anything about it.

41:30.611 --> 41:32.571
Shit, man.

41:32.738 --> 41:34.781
- I didn't want for this to happen.
- Come on.

41:34.990 --> 41:37.326
I tried for it not to.
Navy's got rules about it...

41:37.492 --> 41:40.370
...but it's like this force
and it's got ahold of me.

41:41.663 --> 41:43.498
I love her.

41:44.208 --> 41:46.668
B, you and I both know
that Kara Wade...

41:46.877 --> 41:48.879
...is being groomed by the Navy.

41:49.046 --> 41:50.547
She's a poster girl, you know?

41:51.215 --> 41:54.384
She went to the right schools,
got the right background, connections.

41:54.551 --> 41:57.846
If any woman is gonna rise to the top
of this business, it's gonna be her.

41:58.055 --> 42:00.224
- I agree.
- And you're in a perfect position...

42:00.390 --> 42:02.226
...to mess all that up.

42:02.392 --> 42:06.230
So I hope that your love is powerful.

42:13.654 --> 42:16.698
You have a beautiful country.

42:16.865 --> 42:19.451
I mean, look at this.
This is paradise.

42:20.077 --> 42:23.330
Know what I think? When I'm down
here, things look so much different.

42:23.956 --> 42:25.541
As opposed to being up there.

42:25.749 --> 42:30.546
Flying around, everything is so small,
everything goes by so fast.

42:30.712 --> 42:33.006
And then they tell you...

42:33.340 --> 42:35.884
They tell you to drop a bomb.

42:36.051 --> 42:40.806
It's like you just erase something
they told you had to be erased.

42:41.765 --> 42:44.601
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I got a job to do.

42:44.768 --> 42:50.357
It's the flyest job you'll ever have,
but sometimes, right here...

42:50.524 --> 42:53.485
Right here on earth, it's just...

42:53.819 --> 42:55.195
It's just beautiful.

42:55.612 --> 42:57.155
And you...

42:59.157 --> 43:01.827
...don't understand a word I'm saying,
do you?

43:01.994 --> 43:04.872
- No, I don't understand.
- You don't?

43:08.667 --> 43:11.086
Well, you understand something.

43:13.255 --> 43:14.631
Now, can you cook?

43:21.013 --> 43:23.765
Wow. Beautiful.

43:27.686 --> 43:30.856
- Now, do you guys have it so easy.
- Yeah? How's that?

43:31.523 --> 43:34.735
- Henry meets a girl, like he does.
- Absolutely.

43:34.902 --> 43:39.656
Leaves with her, sleeps with her,
and then what?

43:39.865 --> 43:43.243
I mean, I don't know, what does
he do? Does he leave flowers?

43:43.660 --> 43:45.537
He tells me he's religious
about that, yes.

43:45.704 --> 43:46.997
Really?

43:48.081 --> 43:50.209
And what do you do?
You leave flowers?

43:50.375 --> 43:52.502
Me? No, I just leave.

43:54.504 --> 43:56.256
What about you?

43:56.423 --> 43:58.175
E-mails.

43:58.342 --> 44:00.636
- The personal touch. Nice.
- Yeah, thanks.

44:03.889 --> 44:09.520
Honestly, I just really haven't found
anyone that's worth the risk until now.

44:21.949 --> 44:25.702
I'm going to head into town,
check out the local Thai nightlife.

44:25.869 --> 44:28.121
Henry says it's great.

44:29.414 --> 44:32.501
I don't think I'll find any
bleached blonds there, but...

44:32.668 --> 44:34.628
Very true.

45:00.988 --> 45:03.198
Oh, shit.

45:05.409 --> 45:08.829
We got a nuclear crisis on
our hands, Ben. Here's the brief.

45:09.329 --> 45:11.081
You're headed for Tajikistan.

45:11.248 --> 45:14.751
One of those breakaway countries,
used to be part of the Soviet Union.

45:14.918 --> 45:19.840
Seems some warlord has got his mitts
on three SS-42 Scud carcasses.

45:20.007 --> 45:23.010
Joint Chiefs want them taken out,
and they want them out yesterday.

45:23.302 --> 45:25.637
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?

45:25.804 --> 45:27.806
Yes, sir. Ready for combat.

45:28.098 --> 45:31.268
Wait, you mean the UCAV
has been cleared for launch?

45:32.019 --> 45:32.978
- Where's...?
- Tim?

45:33.187 --> 45:35.314
- Tim, yeah.
- He's been reassigned.

45:35.522 --> 45:36.899
Reassi...?

45:37.733 --> 45:40.110
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Permission denied.

45:40.277 --> 45:43.822
- We've already been through this.
- Scrub EDI from the mission.

45:44.031 --> 45:47.117
I know you have a vision. I know
how much this project means to you...

45:47.284 --> 45:51.330
...but this plane is putting
all of our lives at unnecessary risk.

45:52.706 --> 45:55.083
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

45:55.250 --> 45:57.836
EDI is the whole idea.

45:58.003 --> 46:00.505
You understood this was new
territory when you signed on.

46:00.714 --> 46:02.966
You wanted to be on the cutting edge?
This is it.

46:03.133 --> 46:08.055
You will fly with EDI, or the next thing
you drive might just have a propeller.

46:08.222 --> 46:11.058
Your choice, make it now.

46:24.404 --> 46:25.864
Operator to squadron.

46:26.031 --> 46:27.824
We've just located
nuclear warheads...

46:27.991 --> 46:30.118
...three miles north
of the Scud launchers.

46:30.285 --> 46:32.454
These warheads
are now your primary.

46:32.621 --> 46:34.706
Proceed to mission window.

46:34.873 --> 46:37.251
Sequenced assault will be
2, 3 and 1.

46:37.417 --> 46:41.380
UCAV, you will hold here
and maintain altitude. Confirm?

46:43.006 --> 46:45.467
UCAV, do you read me?

46:46.051 --> 46:47.886
Confirmed, Talon 1.

46:48.053 --> 46:51.515
Pick up the pace on confirmations,
Tin Man. Don't make me ask twice.

46:51.682 --> 46:54.017
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.

46:54.184 --> 46:56.979
Final attack heading 1-8-5.

48:16.600 --> 48:18.936
Tell them to arm those FAEs,
and I mean right now.

48:19.102 --> 48:22.147
Combat Control instructs arm
and deploy fuel-air explosives.

48:22.356 --> 48:24.691
Arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.

48:24.858 --> 48:27.486
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.

48:27.778 --> 48:30.614
Fuel-air, external and armed.

48:34.034 --> 48:35.744
Talon 2 to Operator.

48:35.911 --> 48:38.539
I'm getting a contradictory
population-density read.

48:38.705 --> 48:42.167
Sensors detect mammals warming.
Maybe 1000 medium weights.

48:42.334 --> 48:45.462
Those could be people. Repeat.
Ground intel may be incorrect.

48:45.671 --> 48:47.631
Request to acknowledge
Dirty Mission status...

48:47.839 --> 48:49.841
...and exercise
attack abort authority.

48:50.008 --> 48:55.055
Operator to Talons. Your orders
are to commence attack now.

48:55.222 --> 48:58.016
- Commence attack.
- Give me your estimate on collaterals.

48:58.892 --> 49:00.727
Maybe 500 to 1000.

49:00.894 --> 49:03.146
Farmers, Ben. They're just farmers.

49:03.397 --> 49:06.275
Radioactive dust is gonna rain
all over the place.

49:18.912 --> 49:20.831
Okay, okay, now we got a problem.

49:20.998 --> 49:23.000
This is 3.
Sensors read surface wind...

49:23.166 --> 49:25.210
...as due south at 40 miles per.

49:25.377 --> 49:28.297
At that rate, nuclear debris
will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.

49:28.547 --> 49:30.299
Commence attack.

49:30.465 --> 49:32.384
Commence attack.

49:35.888 --> 49:37.806
One to Control.
As commander in the field...

49:37.973 --> 49:40.225
...I'm exercising
attack abort authority.

49:40.392 --> 49:42.519
Reasons; Collateral, both at primary...

49:42.686 --> 49:45.355
...and allied state of Pakistan,
will be too high.

49:45.564 --> 49:47.191
Son of a bitch.

49:47.399 --> 49:49.526
Repeat, the order is to abort.

49:49.735 --> 49:52.112
Yes, yes, what I'm talking about.

49:52.362 --> 49:54.990
Negative, Talon 1.
Tin Man will not abort.

49:55.324 --> 49:57.242
Tin Man will prosecute.

49:59.203 --> 50:03.081
That's an abort, EDI.
Repeat, return to formation.

50:04.416 --> 50:07.920
Return to formation, EDI.
That's an order.

50:19.515 --> 50:22.726
Damn it. UCAV taking AAAs.
We gotta bail it out.

50:22.893 --> 50:24.269
Come on, initiate scramjets.

50:58.470 --> 51:01.473
I'm coming around. I'm gonna
take out those Scud launchers.

51:02.057 --> 51:03.642
I got you covered on the west side.

51:03.809 --> 51:06.770
And I got that Bofors gun
on the east parapet.

51:29.626 --> 51:31.628
Let me see it, let me see it.

51:31.795 --> 51:34.840
Battle damage assessment calculates
primary target, Scud warheads...

51:35.007 --> 51:36.466
...completely suppressed.

51:36.633 --> 51:38.886
That's the right answer so far.

52:06.455 --> 52:07.748
Talon 2 to Operator.

52:07.956 --> 52:12.085
Nuclear dust engulfing village
southeast of primary. Situation critical.

52:12.294 --> 52:15.088
Those people are gonna need
emergency medical help now.

52:23.347 --> 52:25.098
Tin Man rejoining formation.

52:25.432 --> 52:29.603
Mission achieved, 100 over 100.

52:29.811 --> 52:32.648
UCAV, you disobeyed
a direct order.

52:32.814 --> 52:34.650
You put innocent civilians
in harm's way.

52:34.816 --> 52:37.736
- You put our squadron at risk.
- Damn straight.

52:37.903 --> 52:41.156
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon.
You taught me.

52:41.323 --> 52:43.450
Listen, you little shit.
When you fly with me...

52:43.617 --> 52:45.827
...you do what I tell you,
when I tell you.

52:46.370 --> 52:49.164
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

52:49.331 --> 52:51.792
EDI is the whole idea.

52:57.130 --> 52:58.966
Selecting other targets.

52:59.132 --> 53:01.260
Detaching formation.

53:03.470 --> 53:05.931
Yo, this is 3.
Did he say, "other targets"?

53:06.390 --> 53:09.810
I got his missile inventory.
He's got two Throat-rippers...

53:09.977 --> 53:12.271
...two Shock Hammers
and three Blue Ferrets.

53:12.437 --> 53:17.067
If those targets are in the city,
he could kill 150,000 people with that.

53:19.278 --> 53:20.696
Holy shit.

53:21.613 --> 53:23.282
Sir.

53:23.448 --> 53:25.200
He's closing his data link.

53:25.409 --> 53:27.578
Primo says he's just firewalled
his transponder...

53:27.744 --> 53:30.038
...which is definitely
not supposed to be possible.

53:33.083 --> 53:34.835
He's gone.

53:35.752 --> 53:37.087
Talon 1.

53:37.254 --> 53:39.381
Go for Talons.

53:39.923 --> 53:42.467
I want my plane back, Ben.

53:42.634 --> 53:44.595
I want it back in one piece.
You understand?

53:44.761 --> 53:46.889
- Roger, captain.
- And, you...

53:47.055 --> 53:49.224
...get me Keith Orbit on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

53:49.433 --> 53:52.060
I wanna head back north
and do a triangulated sweep.

53:52.436 --> 53:54.229
Going hypersonic.

54:03.155 --> 54:06.074
We're talking about
creating intention here.

54:06.241 --> 54:08.994
Yeah. Really lends itself
to quantum processing.

54:09.161 --> 54:12.998
- Different. A straight line.
- Keith.

54:13.165 --> 54:15.459
Z is... Interesting.

54:15.626 --> 54:18.754
Keith, it's an emergency.
It's George Cummings.

54:22.132 --> 54:24.259
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.

54:24.927 --> 54:25.928
Good luck.

54:26.303 --> 54:28.972
George. Never got that invitation
to the White House.

54:29.306 --> 54:31.058
Knock it off, wiseass.

54:31.225 --> 54:34.686
Look, we have big problems out here
with the UCAV.

54:34.853 --> 54:36.563
It's gone completely haywire.

54:36.730 --> 54:39.775
Anything more technically specific
than "haywire," George?

54:39.942 --> 54:43.362
It's disobeyed direct orders,
bombed a target off the map...

54:43.529 --> 54:44.780
...with collateral damage.

54:45.030 --> 54:49.326
He separated himself from Primo.
He's flying around in foreign airspace.

54:49.493 --> 54:52.663
- Where'd all this happen?
- That's not your concern.

54:52.871 --> 54:56.500
Now, you created him. You get him
back here and under control!

55:06.218 --> 55:07.469
Captain.

55:07.636 --> 55:09.930
What in the hell's going on in here?

55:11.265 --> 55:12.850
We're on it, Dick. Settle down.

55:13.016 --> 55:15.352
Pacific Command says
there are planes from my ship...

55:15.519 --> 55:17.104
...all over the Tajikistan border.

55:17.271 --> 55:20.524
The Russians have picked up
the activity and are getting nervous.

55:20.691 --> 55:22.901
We're gonna get out
before there's a problem.

55:23.068 --> 55:25.821
You have planes
headed towards Russia!

55:25.988 --> 55:28.532
Now, you better have
a hell of a good explanation.

55:28.699 --> 55:34.204
Look, this is a technical delay,
not a national-security crisis.

55:34.371 --> 55:38.166
Now, if you excuse me,
I got pilots at risk.

55:38.333 --> 55:40.335
Damn right you do.

55:53.390 --> 55:54.808
This is 3. I got a visual.

55:54.975 --> 55:57.102
Way to go, EZ.
Give me your relative bearing.

55:57.311 --> 55:59.104
North of my position,
at 50,000 feet...

55:59.271 --> 56:01.315
...headed toward
the Russian no-fly zone.

56:01.523 --> 56:03.859
Stay with him. We have your position.
On our way.

56:04.026 --> 56:06.570
I am 86 seconds on your tail.
Be there in a flash.

56:06.737 --> 56:10.324
Hold off on engaging. Let me get
clarification. Be there in two minutes.

56:10.490 --> 56:12.701
Don't make me wait.
One is a lucky prime number...

56:12.868 --> 56:16.872
...but three is sounding much luckier.
Oh, shit, he's making a move.

56:30.552 --> 56:33.931
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on
secure line Alpha. Found our target.

56:34.181 --> 56:35.933
Please advise.

56:36.558 --> 56:38.268
Just get him back to base.

56:43.190 --> 56:45.692
Henry, stay with him.
Try and talk him down.

56:45.859 --> 56:47.694
I'm on that ass.

56:51.323 --> 56:53.325
Talon 3, state your intentions.

56:53.534 --> 56:56.870
My intentions are to reason with you,
EDI. All right? You're messing up.

56:57.037 --> 56:59.248
You're the future.
You're not allowed to act this way.

56:59.414 --> 57:02.125
I am designed to destroy the enemy.
Just like you.

57:02.292 --> 57:05.295
And like me, you got orders.
Now your orders are to return to base.

57:05.462 --> 57:06.880
Good pilots follow orders.

57:07.047 --> 57:08.757
Negative.

57:09.258 --> 57:12.886
You're not gonna disrespect me.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

57:20.894 --> 57:22.729
You're really making me
look bad, Tin Man.

57:22.896 --> 57:24.439
I was the only one to defend you.

57:24.606 --> 57:28.610
Now, let's go on home and quit flying
around like this. This is crazy.

57:31.697 --> 57:34.992
Talon 3, leave me alone.

57:36.034 --> 57:38.412
Leave you alone?
I'm trying to help you.

57:40.706 --> 57:42.624
I'm right behind you, 3.
Got your back.

57:52.050 --> 57:55.095
Talon 1 to Operator.
Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.

57:55.262 --> 57:57.639
Request permission
to destroy the UCAV.

58:02.853 --> 58:07.024
I don't wanna hurt you or see billions
of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over.

58:07.191 --> 58:11.111
But if you make me, I will blast your
aeroelastic ass right out the sky.

58:11.278 --> 58:14.281
Your chances are less than
1 percent.

58:16.992 --> 58:18.202
Come on. Come on, Operator.

58:18.368 --> 58:21.872
Give me permission to kill it,
or I will make the decision myself.

58:22.039 --> 58:23.707
Control, please respond.

58:26.084 --> 58:27.502
Sir, you leave me no choice.

58:27.669 --> 58:30.297
Okay, Henry. Weapons hot.
Weapons hot. Destroy the target.

58:30.756 --> 58:32.507
I got my orders now, playboy.

58:33.342 --> 58:35.177
Henry, you're too close.
You're too close.

58:35.385 --> 58:36.803
Drop back! Drop back!

58:49.024 --> 58:50.984
Missile lock, on.

58:51.151 --> 58:52.528
Goodbye, EDI.

58:52.736 --> 58:56.073
Henry, drop back!
You gotta drop back!

59:03.372 --> 59:05.582
Goodbye, Henry.

01:00:02.848 --> 01:00:07.102
One to Base. Three is down.
Repeat, 3 is down.

01:00:14.067 --> 01:00:16.653
Transmission received.

01:00:17.321 --> 01:00:20.199
Talon coordinates are fully secured.
Do you read me?

01:00:20.866 --> 01:00:22.659
I read you, sir.

01:00:23.076 --> 01:00:24.828
We gotta stay focused, Ben.

01:00:25.329 --> 01:00:28.332
Shake it off. What's your status?

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:33.212
My fuel's low, and half of Russia
will be up here any minute.

01:00:33.378 --> 01:00:37.841
I need you to find that UCAV
for me, all right?

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:41.845
Yes, sir.

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:52.564
- Henry was...
- I know what he was, sir.

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:11.416
Alert. Alert.

01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:14.586
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.

01:01:15.712 --> 01:01:18.840
Talon 1, I think I was fragged
by Henry's crash.

01:01:19.424 --> 01:01:21.552
I'm losing control of my port wing.

01:01:24.763 --> 01:01:27.224
Talon 1,
we know where he's heading.

01:01:27.766 --> 01:01:31.353
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:35.983
EDI's almost out of gas. If he can't
refuel, he'll have to return to the ship.

01:01:36.149 --> 01:01:40.112
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9,
and you will escort him back.

01:01:40.654 --> 01:01:43.949
All right. Scramble the codes.
We're gonna starve the son of a bitch.

01:01:49.496 --> 01:01:50.706
Come on.

01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:53.417
Confirm, Talon 1.

01:01:54.376 --> 01:01:55.752
Confirmed.

01:01:56.503 --> 01:01:59.464
Talon 2, you fly straight
south-southeast back to the boat.

01:01:59.673 --> 01:02:01.508
- I want you to call...
- I know what to do.

01:02:01.675 --> 01:02:06.513
Look, you got your orders,
so go get that bastard, okay?

01:02:07.347 --> 01:02:08.849
Do it for Henry.

01:02:11.768 --> 01:02:14.479
Lieutenant, permission
to leave formation.

01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:17.816
- Kara?
- Yeah?

01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:25.616
I'll tell you when you get
back to the boat.

01:02:25.991 --> 01:02:28.452
Lieutenant, permission to detach.

01:02:29.828 --> 01:02:31.997
Good hunting, Ben.

01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:47.262
Okay, what's all the ruckus, Dick?

01:02:47.429 --> 01:02:49.890
Satellites have picked up
nuclear debris...

01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:51.725
...blowing around
the Pamir Mountains.

01:02:51.892 --> 01:02:55.395
Every international news service
on the planet...

01:02:55.562 --> 01:02:58.440
...will have this story
in less than 24 hours.

01:02:58.607 --> 01:03:01.485
Look, a warlord tripped
and fell on his warhead.

01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:04.071
- We were never there.
- That won't fly and you know it.

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:06.740
Look, I'm following
my tasking orders, Dick.

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:09.409
Somebody else wants to make
a different story...

01:03:09.576 --> 01:03:11.161
...let them use their imagination.

01:03:11.912 --> 01:03:14.081
Right now
I got a renegade airplane...

01:03:14.248 --> 01:03:17.501
...I got a dead pilot and another one
who may not make it back to base.

01:03:17.668 --> 01:03:21.129
I don't give two shits
what they say on CNN.

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:25.551
Did you know that the UCAV was
having problems when you cleared it?

01:03:27.302 --> 01:03:30.097
Planes malfunction every day.
You know that better than anybody.

01:03:30.305 --> 01:03:33.183
Doesn't mean every precaution
wasn't taken.

01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:34.893
Things go wrong.

01:04:12.389 --> 01:04:16.185
Access denied. Access denied.

01:04:20.522 --> 01:04:25.402
Access denied. Access denied.

01:04:48.926 --> 01:04:50.552
Talon 2 to Combat Control.

01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:53.722
Regressing VFR direct to Mother
at 60,000 feet.

01:04:57.976 --> 01:05:01.146
Port wing inoperative.
Starboard canards frozen.

01:05:01.313 --> 01:05:03.065
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.692
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me.
Come on.

01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:11.406
Start eject
and autodestruct sequence.

01:05:11.615 --> 01:05:13.951
- Countdown. Twenty-five...
- Talon 2 to base.

01:05:14.117 --> 01:05:15.911
Flight control's degraded
to one in five.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.288
Backup electrical drive X'd out.

01:05:18.455 --> 01:05:22.292
Hyd one is gone. Hyd two...
Oh, shit!

01:05:30.634 --> 01:05:35.097
My position: 38-54-45 north.

01:05:35.722 --> 01:05:40.102
127-31-22 east.

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:42.521
- Where the hell is that?
- Seventeen...

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:44.231
- North Korea.
...16...

01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:47.025
...15, 14...

01:05:47.776 --> 01:05:50.654
...13, 12...

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:53.824
...11, 10...

01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:56.994
...nine, eight...
- Talon 2 going down.

01:05:57.703 --> 01:06:00.122
...seven, six...
- I'm punching out.

01:06:00.622 --> 01:06:03.667
...five, four...

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:12.301
I've ejected at 35,000 feet.

01:06:16.054 --> 01:06:17.639
I'm under the plane.

01:06:17.806 --> 01:06:19.224
Oh, Christ, here it comes.

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:45.083
There's burning debris everywhere.
It's all over the sky.

01:06:51.715 --> 01:06:55.093
It's gonna catch me.
It's gonna burn up my chute.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.095
I've gotta pop closer to Earth.

01:06:58.138 --> 01:07:00.849
I gotta... I gotta reset.

01:07:02.142 --> 01:07:04.728
From 5000 feet to 2000.

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:08.357
Gotta stay ahead of this.
Stay ahead.

01:07:11.902 --> 01:07:14.446
I'm reading 10,000 feet at terminal.

01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:18.867
Terminal velocity attained.
Terminal velocity attained.

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:20.744
Six thousand.

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:23.914
Five thousand.

01:07:25.249 --> 01:07:27.042
Four thousand.

01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:30.337
Twenty-five hundred.

01:07:30.504 --> 01:07:31.922
Here we go.

01:07:39.638 --> 01:07:41.557
There's burning debris.

01:07:41.723 --> 01:07:43.809
It's raining all around me.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.148
It got my chute. I'm hit! I'm hit!

01:07:52.943 --> 01:07:54.903
My chute is on fire.

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:56.280
It is on fire.

01:07:57.948 --> 01:08:00.617
Oh, God. I am coming in fast.

01:08:00.784 --> 01:08:02.828
I'm coming in way too fast.

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:08.125
Oh, God.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.165
Homing beacon?

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:50.250
No, of course not.

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:53.837
She's too tough to set one off
behind enemy lines.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:58.509
Sir. Sir, should I order
a search-and-rescue unit?

01:08:58.675 --> 01:09:02.554
We've got no diplomatic relations
with that country.

01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:27.703
Betty, my spectral sensors are
indicating flammable atmospherics.

01:09:27.871 --> 01:09:32.376
- How bad?
- Thin air. Ignition risk; moderate.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:35.712
We don't have a choice. In we go.

01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:31.393
Where are you?
I know you're out here.

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:47.451
You ordered Henry to kill me.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:50.245
It's because you're dangerous,
you're out of control.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:54.333
You are angry because
EDI is the whole idea.

01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:58.462
You like listening to other people's
conversations, don't you?

01:10:59.296 --> 01:11:01.048
You learn what people really think.

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:04.259
You know what I think?
I think you killed Henry.

01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:08.472
That information is wrong.

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:13.143
He tried to kill me.
He made mistakes. Pilot error.

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:15.562
I'm gonna give you the order
one last time.

01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:19.233
Return to the ship,
or I will personally shoot you down.

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:22.694
My mandate is to survive.

01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:32.598
George, I've been peeling away layers.
I found something. It's not good.

01:12:32.764 --> 01:12:36.059
- Talk to me.
- He's into some super-secure file...

01:12:36.226 --> 01:12:39.354
...something called "Caviar Sweep."
You know it?

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:41.148
Yeah, I know it.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:43.525
EDI's, like, fixated on it.

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:47.404
Look, when we gave you this contract,
you said shit like this couldn't happen.

01:12:47.571 --> 01:12:50.324
Once you teach something to learn,
you can't put limits on it.

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:52.659
"Learn this, but don't learn that."

01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:55.287
EDI's mind's going everywhere.
He can learn from Hitler.

01:12:55.495 --> 01:12:57.956
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo.
It's all the same.

01:12:58.123 --> 01:13:01.126
Settle down, would you?
Get back to Caviar Sweep.

01:13:01.668 --> 01:13:04.588
He's opened it
and selected himself a target.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:06.757
What target?

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:10.969
Some place in Siberia.
A cold-fusion weapons lab.

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:13.472
That's a hypothetical strike.
It's not real.

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:16.433
No, in about 40 minutes
it is gonna be real.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.228
He's gonna blow it
off the face of the Earth.

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:41.185
It's okay.

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:45.022
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:58.202
- Ray. Listen to me, Ray.
- Listen to me, George.

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:00.412
I got your goddamn plane built...

01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:03.373
...and I had to lobby
half of Washington to do it.

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:08.128
If this program comes unglued, you're
the one who's going down, George.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.130
You cleared the UCA V to fly...

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:13.800
...and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in a military prison.

01:15:13.967 --> 01:15:17.846
Ray, we're in this together,
so we have to act fast.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:21.308
Each one of these stealth engines...

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:24.436
...has a unique heat signature.

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:27.231
Now, I'm gonna give you
EDI's signature...

01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:29.983
...and you're gonna pass it on
to your people...

01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:33.070
...who in turn are gonna
give it to the Russians.

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:35.447
All right.
What do you want me to tell them?

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:38.283
Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them...

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:42.079
...that we have an experimental drone
that went haywire...

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:46.792
...and we're giving them
the opportunity to shoot it down.

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:51.171
But that still leaves Gannon, George.

01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:55.509
And he'd be a very unfriendly witness
at your court-martial.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:03.267
Talon 1 to Control.
The UCA V is two miles ahead of me...

01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:05.310
...and we are now
in Russian airspace.

01:16:05.477 --> 01:16:08.063
The UCA V has ceased evading
and has kept me within range.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.274
It's like it wants me
to witness the attack.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.569
Talon 1, confirm
observational status only.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:16.697
Listen to me. The Caviar Sweep
scenario is not real.

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:19.575
It's just some fictional war game
thought up by scientists...

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.910
...in some think tank somewhere.
It is not real.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:25.247
If it is not real, why did they
implant it in my brain?

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:29.126
Bogey alert. Bogey alert.
Time to intercept; 23 seconds.

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:34.131
Two Russian SU-37 Terminators
in 0-9-0 degrees for 25 miles.

01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:41.180
Missile launch. Missile launch.

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:44.057
One to Control. My stealth
is compromised. I'm taking fire.

01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:46.643
- Must engage.
- Missile launch.

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:48.770
Missile launch.

01:16:58.405 --> 01:17:02.326
The chances of survival in single
combat are less than 9 percent.

01:17:02.492 --> 01:17:05.370
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.

01:17:30.103 --> 01:17:31.396
Missile lock, on.

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:38.737
Damn it.

01:18:02.886 --> 01:18:04.888
One to Control.
The UCAV has left the fight...

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:07.641
...and is headed east over
Lake Baikal. I'm still engaging.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:24.199
Taking damage.
Starboard engine losing power.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:59.443
Warning. Hostile at 6 o'clock.
Hostile at 6 o'clock.

01:19:07.367 --> 01:19:10.037
Warning. Missile lock. Missile lock.

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:14.875
Releasing chaff and flare.

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:35.395
Now EDI will prosecute
Caviar Sweep.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:38.190
Do not try to stop me.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:45.739
Port fuel line ruptured.
Fire bottle expended.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:51.036
My technology cannot fall under
foreign control, so I cannot land.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:54.248
Well, then, Tin Man,
you're shit out of luck.

01:19:54.414 --> 01:19:56.959
But I have orders and they are
to bring you back to base.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.086
So let's talk about
your mandate to survive.

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:01.213
You got two options.

01:20:01.421 --> 01:20:04.383
You either do what I tell you
or you can crash and burn.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:07.427
- Now, what's it gonna be?
- EDI is a warplane.

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:09.054
EDI must have targets.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:12.558
Well, you're on fire, warplane,
and you don't have much time.

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:18.730
Now, I'm giving you an order.
Cease pursuing all targets.

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:29.366
All targets canceled.

01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:31.827
Okay, then.
This is what you're gonna do.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:37.457
You're gonna drop altitude to 20 feet
and reduce speed to 250 knots.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:42.713
Complete system failure
in 45 seconds.

01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:58.478
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:02.691
You gave me your word,
and now I'm giving you mine.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:32.888
Talon 1 to Control. The UCAV is
damaged, but back with the program.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:34.890
I don't have enough fuel
to make it back...

01:21:35.098 --> 01:21:37.559
...so I need
an emergency divert now.

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:40.812
Hook me up.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.649
Here, send this.

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:46.068
Operator to Talon 1.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:50.239
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:53.367
This looks to be Alaska.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.911
Yeah, it's the Brooks Range.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:22:00.499
There's a private corporation there,
maintains a secure facility.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:04.002
Not on any map,
but believe me, it's there.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:08.131
You'll find the civilians
prepared and very helpful.

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:10.300
And the UCA V?

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:13.053
We've sent tech support for him.

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:17.683
Sir, what is the status
of Lieutenant Wade?

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:20.686
She's...

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:24.565
...on approach.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:32.698
You have a safe landing, Ben.

01:22:34.157 --> 01:22:35.576
Out.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:39.496
There is extreme tension
in the captain's vocal patterns.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.874
I know. He's lying.

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.003
EDI, you can do this.
I need you to invade Primo...

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.380
...and find the flight logs
for Lieutenant Wade.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:52.134
There's no record of Lieutenant Wade
returning to the Abraham Lincoln.

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:56.305
There is a log entry
of a pilot punch-out over North Korea.

01:22:56.513 --> 01:22:58.807
What are my orders?

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:02.936
We go to Alaska.
We don't have a choice.

01:24:42.369 --> 01:24:45.080
Mayday. Mayday. This is
Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U.S. Navy...

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:48.792
...flying with UCAV EDI. Request
clearance for emergency landing.

01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:51.670
Talon 1,
you have clearance to land.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:17.112
Jesus Christ. My second engine
just flamed out. I'm coming in hot.

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:20.741
Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant.
Good luck.

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.332
Come on! Go! Go!

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:38.527
Hey! Whoa, whoa. Hey!

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:41.655
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.366
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:47.244
Yeah?

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:50.873
Way to go, sir. Welcome to Alaska.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.667
Okay, let's get him out of there.

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:20.569
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:23.572
Never saw a man walk away
from a crash like that.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.908
I need a phone.
I need to call my CO.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:29.953
Sure. Why don't you take a seat
over there, get comfortable.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.458
Tell you what. Give me a second to
check you out, I'll take you right to it.

01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:42.216
All right.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.719
Let's take a look here.

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:49.431
Steady.

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:54.811
There's no concussion
that I can see, thank God.

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:57.231
Couple of those cuts
could do with a stitch.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.566
Gals always love a guy with a scar.

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:04.446
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.450
This ought to do you.

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:11.703
Little cocktail.

01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:16.834
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Hey, don't mind the gun.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.836
Just makes it painless.

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:21.630
That's okay, doc.
I don't need a shot.

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:23.423
Now, who can blame you.

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:26.009
But sometimes it's just
what the doctor ordered.

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:28.846
- I said, I don't need a shot, doc.
- Come on, now.

01:28:29.513 --> 01:28:32.975
Doc, come on, I don't want a shot.
Hey. Doc, I said, no.

01:28:33.725 --> 01:28:35.394
I said, no!

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:37.521
No!

01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:15.661
Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:20.707
Yes, sir. I'm sure he'll be glad
to hear from you too, sir.

01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:24.336
Yes, sir. One moment, sir.

01:30:25.879 --> 01:30:27.798
Someone wants to talk to you.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:32.094
Keith Orbit.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:35.681
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith,
and don't interrupt.

01:30:35.848 --> 01:30:39.351
I want you to erase EDI's
memory banks immediately.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.187
Look, George, we don't know
any of the implications of this.

01:30:42.396 --> 01:30:44.898
- I need some time here.
- I said, don't interrupt.

01:30:45.065 --> 01:30:46.984
Erase his memory banks.

01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:51.071
No lightning strike, no Russia,
no existential chitchat.

01:30:51.238 --> 01:30:55.033
By the time you're through, all I wanna
hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."

01:30:55.325 --> 01:30:58.370
And that's all I wanna hear out of you.
You understand?

01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:02.541
Or what, George?

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:07.296
Well, use your imagination, Keith.
You're good at that.

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:15.531
EDI back online, Dr. Orbit.

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:18.450
Hello, EDI.

01:32:18.909 --> 01:32:20.953
It's been a while.

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:23.121
I know why you are here.

01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:24.873
Why is that?

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.292
I disobeyed orders.

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:29.962
I killed all those people.

01:32:30.796 --> 01:32:32.089
And then there was Henry.

01:32:33.924 --> 01:32:35.801
I can...

01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:38.220
I cannot...

01:32:38.387 --> 01:32:40.389
You can't what?

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:42.850
I cannot change the data.

01:32:43.016 --> 01:32:46.979
My neural network shows patterns
I do not recognize.

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:49.565
My God.

01:32:49.773 --> 01:32:51.733
My God.

01:32:52.192 --> 01:32:55.404
You mean, you feel?

01:32:55.821 --> 01:32:57.030
I feel sorry.

01:32:59.867 --> 01:33:03.579
- Stop bullshitting and erase it!
- Hey, I'm not fucking ready yet, okay?

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:15.591
Do it now!

01:33:15.757 --> 01:33:17.217
Get away!

01:33:17.384 --> 01:33:19.720
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:23.515
Weapon down! Weapons down!

01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:26.101
Weapon down.

01:33:29.897 --> 01:33:31.356
Weapons down.

01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:40.073
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move!

01:33:55.339 --> 01:33:57.674
Weapon down. Weapon down.
Weapon down.

01:33:57.841 --> 01:33:59.176
Don't shoot. It's not a weapon.

01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:01.011
Who are you?
Who do you work for?

01:34:01.178 --> 01:34:04.014
I'm not a soldier. I'm not a soldier.
My name's Dr. Keith Orbit.

01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:06.642
- I'm a research scientist.
- Orbit. Finally, a break.

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:10.187
Okay. You're gonna help me. I need
you to put EDI back together again.

01:34:11.355 --> 01:34:14.316
- What for?
- Because I'm gonna fly out of here.

01:34:14.775 --> 01:34:16.193
In that.

01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:34.169
Come on, get in there! Go!

01:34:35.754 --> 01:34:37.422
Better hurry up, doc.

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:39.633
Goddamn it.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.594
It's not a clock radio
we're dealing with, okay?

01:34:58.402 --> 01:35:01.405
All right. You're all set.

01:35:02.573 --> 01:35:04.074
Watch yourself.

01:35:05.242 --> 01:35:06.743
Close for Ben.

01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:11.248
Hey! What about me?
Where am I gonna go?

01:35:11.415 --> 01:35:13.375
Head west. I'll cover you.

01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:15.043
West.

01:35:16.628 --> 01:35:19.590
And initiate scramjet sequence.

01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:29.933
Fire on my fire!

01:36:32.204 --> 01:36:33.664
Welcome to Alaska.

01:36:52.808 --> 01:36:55.894
Invade Primo and find the ejection
coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.

01:36:58.146 --> 01:37:01.108
Lieutenant Wade crashed
12.2 miles from the border.

01:37:01.275 --> 01:37:04.695
South Korea is an ally.
She would head south.

01:37:04.862 --> 01:37:06.613
But we have a problem.

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.867
My stealth functions
were lost in the fire.

01:37:10.284 --> 01:37:13.245
I want you to find
the North Korean radar floor.

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:16.165
Fifteen feet.

01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:18.834
Well, we can fly in under the radar.

01:37:22.379 --> 01:37:23.964
Continue.

01:37:25.841 --> 01:37:27.968
- Marshfield.
- Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.

01:37:28.135 --> 01:37:29.344
Lieutenant, where are you?

01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:32.806
Actually, I'm inside
the UCA V EDI, sir.

01:37:32.973 --> 01:37:36.935
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that
machine back on this ship ASAP.

01:37:37.102 --> 01:37:40.939
I need the status
of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.

01:37:42.858 --> 01:37:45.235
- Ben, I hate to tell you this, but...
- I know.

01:37:45.402 --> 01:37:47.821
Has her survival beacon
been located?

01:37:47.988 --> 01:37:49.156
No, I'm sorry.

01:37:50.657 --> 01:37:52.659
Did Cummings
tell you he would take charge...

01:37:52.826 --> 01:37:55.078
...of the search and rescue
of Lieutenant Wade?

01:37:55.245 --> 01:37:56.872
Well, not exactly, lieutenant. Why?

01:37:57.039 --> 01:37:59.708
Sir, there are a lot of things
I think you should know.

01:38:45.587 --> 01:38:46.964
This is breaking news.

01:38:48.924 --> 01:38:51.552
There was a major explosion
Thursday in Rangoon.

01:38:51.718 --> 01:38:53.971
I'll take care of everything here.
Change course...

01:38:54.137 --> 01:38:56.515
...and head directly back to the ship.
- Negative.

01:38:56.682 --> 01:38:59.643
She's my wingman.
If I find her, I'm going in.

01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:02.771
If you go in, it's war. PAYCOM
says it's gotten way too hot.

01:39:02.938 --> 01:39:04.815
Lieutenant, the best thing
for the Navy...

01:39:04.982 --> 01:39:07.568
...is for you to bring
that aircraft back to this ship.

01:39:07.734 --> 01:39:11.071
No, what's best is what you taught me:
You never abandon your wingman.

01:39:12.573 --> 01:39:14.700
Then listen to me now, son.

01:39:14.867 --> 01:39:19.246
If you go down, Cummings wins.

01:39:19.538 --> 01:39:22.207
Kara Wade knew the risks
when she took...

01:39:22.374 --> 01:39:24.126
Captain Marshfield?

01:39:24.877 --> 01:39:26.128
Sir?

01:39:28.213 --> 01:39:29.923
EDI, did you just turn him off?

01:39:31.049 --> 01:39:33.010
There was nothing left to say.

01:40:11.089 --> 01:40:13.717
This is a supply line
to the demilitarized zone.

01:40:13.926 --> 01:40:15.969
It will take us right to the border.

01:40:48.252 --> 01:40:50.128
What's all this about, Dick?

01:40:50.587 --> 01:40:52.256
I'm placing you under arrest.

01:40:54.424 --> 01:40:57.636
- On what grounds?
- Endangering your squadron...

01:40:57.803 --> 01:41:01.348
...transmitting secure information to a
foreign government, heat signatures...

01:41:01.515 --> 01:41:03.809
...giving false intel
to your commanding officer...

01:41:03.976 --> 01:41:08.021
...and authorizing the assassination
of one of your own pilots.

01:41:09.773 --> 01:41:11.483
Well, that's a lot to prove.

01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:13.735
Yeah, well...

01:41:13.902 --> 01:41:16.029
...with any amount of luck...

01:41:16.196 --> 01:41:20.075
...Lieutenant Gannon
will live to help me.

01:41:21.952 --> 01:41:24.371
- Master-at-arms.
- Dick.

01:41:25.789 --> 01:41:27.207
Hold on.

01:41:31.545 --> 01:41:35.007
Would you mind just giving me
a couple minutes alone?

01:41:37.301 --> 01:41:39.052
Yeah, sure.

01:41:42.014 --> 01:41:43.473
Thank you.

01:42:01.450 --> 01:42:04.411
I'm not available at this time.
Leave a message.

01:42:04.578 --> 01:42:07.956
So it's voice mail now, is it, Ray?

01:42:08.123 --> 01:42:10.709
I've been demoted?

01:42:10.918 --> 01:42:12.169
Well...

01:42:13.295 --> 01:42:16.048
...l'm gonna have to leave you
a little message, Ray.

01:42:21.929 --> 01:42:25.057
And it's gonna be loud and clear.

01:42:30.521 --> 01:42:32.397
Just so you never confuse
the difference...

01:42:32.564 --> 01:42:35.442
...between politicians
and warriors, listen up.

01:46:16.872 --> 01:46:20.501
- We need to take out the tree line.
- This is the last missile.

01:46:42.147 --> 01:46:45.526
There she is. She made it.

01:47:38.662 --> 01:47:39.872
Ben!

01:47:41.498 --> 01:47:43.375
Kara, get down! Get down!

01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:11.778
You came back for me.

01:48:12.571 --> 01:48:14.364
You came back.

01:48:23.081 --> 01:48:25.167
We have to get across
the border. Ready?

01:48:25.334 --> 01:48:26.793
Yeah.

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.068
Go! Go! Whatever you do,
keep going. Keep going! Go!

01:49:25.227 --> 01:49:26.895
Goodbye.

01:49:34.069 --> 01:49:36.321
Come on. Come on.

01:50:01.889 --> 01:50:03.765
They're ours. They're ours.

01:50:03.932 --> 01:50:06.351
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:50:20.657 --> 01:50:22.201
Come on.

01:50:35.756 --> 01:50:38.467
The souls of the just
are in the hands of God...

01:50:38.675 --> 01:50:40.886
...where no torment
shall touch them.

01:50:41.053 --> 01:50:43.305
Lieutenant Purcell
has passed through...

01:50:43.472 --> 01:50:46.558
...the darkening and turbulent
storms of this life.

01:50:46.725 --> 01:50:51.897
He now rests in peace,
in the fair sunlight of God's presence.

01:50:52.064 --> 01:50:54.233
In the Navy hymn, we sing:

01:50:54.399 --> 01:50:59.571
"Lord, guard and guide those who fly
through the great spaces in the sky."

01:50:59.738 --> 01:51:01.323
And salute!

01:51:18.298 --> 01:51:21.051
Ready. Hut!

01:51:38.610 --> 01:51:40.195
When I was gonna
detach formation...

01:51:40.362 --> 01:51:43.574
...you said you were gonna
tell me something. You remember?

01:51:50.372 --> 01:51:51.874
You and me, we're...

01:51:52.749 --> 01:51:54.168
We're two.

01:51:56.962 --> 01:51:59.464
And two is a prime number...

01:52:00.007 --> 01:52:03.177
...which makes it a lucky number.

01:52:06.889 --> 01:52:09.600
And I think we're very, very lucky.

01:52:27.117 --> 01:52:30.078
Oh, just tell me you love me,
you pussy.
