WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:06.230
I'm here, my darling! Get
your fucking hands off him!

00:06.280 --> 00:07.990
This is fucking child abuse!

00:08.039 --> 00:09.470
We need to look at Wolf's teeth.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.590
There's nothing wrong with his teeth!

00:11.640 --> 00:13.550
What is this?! Fucking Guantanamo?!

00:13.600 --> 00:15.190
No-one is going to hurt him,

00:15.240 --> 00:19.240
we just need to encourage
Wolf to open his mouth.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.910
All right, good boy.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.790
Open your mouth. Good boy.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.990
Mr Kavanagh.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.230
Let me look...

00:28.280 --> 00:30.670
Oh, wow.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.710
OK. That's not ideal.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.510
Ooh!

00:34.560 --> 00:37.830
Fuck!

00:37.880 --> 00:41.880
It was seeing those little children
suffering that really got to me.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.270
And that's when I turned the
documentary off and I decided,

00:45.320 --> 00:49.320
there and then, that I would give
up my stupid job in the stupid bank,

00:49.720 --> 00:52.630
and retrain as a social worker.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.150
And I did.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.710
Sorry, Mimi. I think I
might've just about given you

00:56.760 --> 01:00.030
- my entire life story there.
- Sorry, what?

01:00.080 --> 01:02.830
Oh. When did you pop those in?

01:02.880 --> 01:06.880
As soon as we got on the bus.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.510
Everyone. Everyone.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.030
This is Limahl, my foster son.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.230
You ain't my fucking mumu!

01:15.280 --> 01:16.990
OK, bro. It's not cool to cuss in here.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.470
- Go fuck yourself, wanker.
- OK, that's really not cool, is it?

01:19.520 --> 01:22.790
My mum was fit, beautiful. She wasn't
some old nanfest, like this one.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.590
Well, I don't claim to be a fashion model.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.230
Everyone stared at my mum.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.150
So my dad thrashed her. Still
be alive if she looked like you.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.710
Yes, point taken. Anyway, Limahl
is with me today because...

01:32.760 --> 01:34.030
I'm on Level 5, man.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.510
- Been excluded.
- That's nothing to be proud of, is it?

01:36.560 --> 01:39.830
He's helping me today, and he's just
made everyone a lovely cup of tea.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.590
- So if you'd like to take...
- Fuck that.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.430
- Why one's your computer?
- Oh, that one.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.590
- Tea for me, please.
- There you go, Martin.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.630
Thank you.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.190
Thank you. Oh, there you go. Thank you.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.150
I'll just grab one for Denise as well.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.350
- Two for you. - OK now, Ingrid, you
really shouldn't have brought him in.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.950
Well, what else was I supposed to do?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.270
He's been excluded, and
he's under a child curfew.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.510
OK, but we're going to
visit the Mehmets, Ingrid.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.790
I've had a tip-off that they're PKK.

02:06.840 --> 02:10.840
We can't have Stormzy here tagging
along, looking for a fight.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.630
Oh, Jesus...!

02:12.680 --> 02:14.550
- Poo!
- What?

02:14.600 --> 02:17.150
Did Limahl make this?! Because
it's classic knob-hand!

02:17.200 --> 02:18.630
He's had his hand on his crotch!

02:18.680 --> 02:20.190
This cup smells of knob!

02:20.240 --> 02:22.670
Actually, I made it.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.720
OK, that's kind of worse.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.670
Carol. Fancy a cuppa?

02:29.720 --> 02:33.720
Lovely, thanks.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.870
Someone's nicked those files.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.110
I first noticed that data had
gone missing the day Mimi arrived.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.230
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.510
So you think that Mimi hacked
into the server and then

02:45.560 --> 02:49.510
- deleted random sets of case notes?
- It was all meant to be digitised.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.310
But what if it wasn't? And what if
the files are just hanging around in

02:52.360 --> 02:53.790
boxes and she nabbed them?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.030
And what possible motive
would she have for stealing

02:56.080 --> 02:58.070
a load of case notes from the late '80s?

02:58.120 --> 03:00.750
She could simply find the missing
files and get all the credit?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.710
How would she have got
them off the premises?

03:02.760 --> 03:04.670
Never heard of drug mules, Martin?

03:04.720 --> 03:08.190
They stick it up their...

03:08.240 --> 03:09.710
(.. arses.)

03:09.760 --> 03:13.760
There would have been enough data
to fill several large box files.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.670
OK, maybe she typed it all up,
chucked the original files,

03:17.720 --> 03:19.830
and downloaded it on to a memory stick?

03:19.880 --> 03:22.110
Which she then stuck up her arse.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.190
You should be very careful
with this theory, Nat.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.240
Because you could end up
looking absolutely ridiculous!

03:32.120 --> 03:34.470
That's better.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.520
Now, honestly, think it through!

03:39.920 --> 03:43.920
Charlie, we literally dropped
you at school 15 minutes ago.

03:44.680 --> 03:48.350
No, you're wrong, that is the
correct use of the word "literally".

03:48.400 --> 03:51.510
But how can you have already lost
your dinner money, your house keys,

03:51.560 --> 03:53.390
and your ID card?

03:53.440 --> 03:55.790
Bet some kids flushed
them down the blog again.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.430
Someone's flushed them down the
bog? Will they have to fish them out?

03:58.480 --> 04:00.150
Bet there's sick in the bog.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.870
There's sick in the bog?

04:01.920 --> 04:05.230
Well, just tell your form tutor.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.670
All right, I'll send
Dad in to sort it out.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.470
What?! Don't drag me into it!

04:09.520 --> 04:11.870
I've got to go home and
walk that fucking puppy!

04:11.920 --> 04:13.830
All right, love. Bye.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.950
Well, you bought the fucking puppy.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.990
Anyway, don't worry, you're off
the hook with your daughter.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.430
Well, you just LITERALLY told
her I was going in the school.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.150
Yeah, and when I told her you were
coming in, she said, If he comes in,

04:26.200 --> 04:29.190
I'll literally kill myself.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.240
Actually, Rose. Can I come
up and use your crapper?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.750
Use the one on second floor, all right?

04:35.800 --> 04:38.350
There's a wanky firm
of architects up there.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.400
They can enjoy your rancid wafts.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.670
Do I have to take her?

04:44.720 --> 04:46.750
She's a dead weight.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.830
But it was bad enough when Ingrid was
claiming disability for being neutered.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.630
Now she's getting paid twice.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.190
Once here, and then once at
some private fostering agency.

04:55.240 --> 04:58.590
And on top of that, now she's
dragging that evil kid in

04:58.640 --> 05:01.630
- for us to sort out.
- Neutered?

05:01.680 --> 05:03.070
She's an underperforming,

05:03.120 --> 05:06.630
stoopy senior resource who is going
to accompany you on a client visit,

05:06.680 --> 05:09.030
not a domestic pet.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.990
And never describe a child as evil.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.710
But this one actually is.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.510
You might want to lock
your handbag in a drawer.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.590
Can Rose not come with me instead?

05:18.640 --> 05:22.150
No. Rose will divert it into a
Tesco's trip, or a late break,

05:22.200 --> 05:24.430
and I'm not giving her that opportunity.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.510
She can stay here and handle Limahl.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.560
I just... er... I just want
to say that I... sympathise...

05:31.160 --> 05:32.710
.. with you.

05:32.760 --> 05:36.630
Because it must be challenging with
Rose and your brother kind of...

05:36.680 --> 05:38.030
You know.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.470
I just, I would not want
to mix work and family.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.750
The thought of my brother
telling everyone about me

05:42.800 --> 05:46.390
wetting the bed is a nightmare. Not
that, that's a made-up example.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.070
Because A, I've never
wet the bed in my life.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.150
It's elly weird but
I've never wet the bed.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.070
B, Right?

05:53.120 --> 05:57.120
Just for the record, Dennis has not
told Rose about you wetting the bed.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.910
What he did tell her about, though,

05:58.960 --> 06:02.710
was the... You know, the...

06:02.760 --> 06:06.760
It wasn't in... There
were no details. But...

06:07.280 --> 06:09.510
The other thing! You know?

06:09.560 --> 06:13.560
- No, I don't know.
- Nor do I.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.510
Now, Nitin. Go and find out why the
Mehmet family has stopped sending their

06:18.560 --> 06:21.830
child to school before she ends
up on the at-risk register.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.790
Yes, ma'am.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.910
And Nitin. Wash your hands.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.510
This cup of tea you've given
me smells like testes.

06:31.560 --> 06:35.560
Can you tell me what time
is Danger Mouse on today?

06:35.880 --> 06:39.880
Do you know, we're not really a service
for giving schedules on television.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.750
You can find the Radio Times
or some other publication.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.800
- You're fucking useless.
- Bye, thank you!

06:49.000 --> 06:55.074

06:57.400 --> 06:59.590
Morning, Al, nice of you to show up.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.550
I've been at the dentist.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.350
Yes, well, strictly speaking,

07:03.400 --> 07:07.390
- you should be doing that at a
time which doesn't impinge upon
your working hours. - Really? Well,

07:07.440 --> 07:11.230
I'm sure the child that needs to
have eight extractions would agree.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.510
Eight teeth out?

07:12.560 --> 07:15.750
- I've only got about eight left.
How old's the kid? - He's six.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.550
Abject apologies, Al. I steamed in
there without all the information.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.910
Cardinal sin for a social worker.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.750
- Facts first.
- Actually, Martin,

07:23.800 --> 07:27.750
current thinking is that sometimes
you have to effect an AFFL.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.950
- Beg your puddingworth?
- Act first, facts later.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.590
The oil change post Sharon Shoesmith.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.110
Sharon Whosmith?

07:35.160 --> 07:37.830
Oh, my God, that's like, route
one social worker stuff.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.270
Baby P, Haringey Council 2007.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.630
Ed Bulls hung her out to dry on live TV.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.190
Yes, it was a little joke, Mimi.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.790
I know who she is.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.390
How could we forget?

07:48.440 --> 07:51.430
We all had Shoesmith and Balls
shoved down our throats.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.470
Well, that's a pretty sick
joke, it's inappropriate.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.110
- No wonder this place is failing.
- I stand corrected.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.630
Team, we can all learn a lot
from young Mimi's attitude.

08:01.680 --> 08:05.680
Her moral compass is bang on.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.790
Ajay, now would you say
you were early or late?

08:09.840 --> 08:11.470
- Late.
- Yes, you're late.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.390
- Do you have an excuse?
- My cat died.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.310
Your cat died six months ago.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.190
Do you think it's time you moved on?

08:17.240 --> 08:19.030
- I suppose, sir.
- All right, cut along.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.350
- She's living with
him, you know? - What?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.350
Yep. Moved in,

08:23.400 --> 08:27.350
got kicked out of her feminist housing
association collective commune or

08:27.400 --> 08:31.310
wherever she was probably living, and
now she's freeloading off Martin.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.150
Hey Al, should I take out a
family file for the Wolf kid?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.669
There's a wolf kid?!

08:35.720 --> 08:37.110
Oh, my God!

08:37.159 --> 08:40.309
Wolf is the child's name.
The dentist's refusing.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.669
- I knew that. - There won't be
any core assessments on record.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.390
The kid's not in school.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.750
The mother is a traveller. I hope.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.470
I did a dissertation about the
semiotics of women in the traveller

08:50.520 --> 08:51.950
community.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.470
Oi!

08:58.520 --> 09:02.520
Oi!

09:02.960 --> 09:04.150
Hiya. Darren, is it?

09:04.200 --> 09:05.830
- Yeah.
- Can't let you in.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.950
I told you before, everyone says
you've got to go to the police.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.510
No, no. Because the police
said to come back here.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.670
- I want to help.
- OK, then...

09:14.720 --> 09:18.720
Who's that? I think I
remember them, what's the name?

09:19.760 --> 09:23.670
She was carrying a plant.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.590
- Darren, there's no-one behind me.
- Oh, come on...

09:26.640 --> 09:29.030
Yeah, I know that face.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.350
- I can't... I've got to shut the door now.
- Why are you doing that?

09:31.400 --> 09:32.870
I've got to.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.970
AHHH!

09:36.320 --> 09:38.270
Why are you doing that?!

09:38.320 --> 09:40.430
Why you...

09:40.480 --> 09:42.270
Doing that?!

09:42.320 --> 09:43.870
I'm going to be back!

09:43.920 --> 09:46.350
And I'll get justice, yeah?!

09:46.400 --> 09:50.390
Watch!

09:50.440 --> 09:53.870
There's no plants in here.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.990
Rose, Rose!

09:56.040 --> 09:58.590
Come on! Thank you very much.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.470
Thank you. Your fucking
car's has been nicked.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.110
Very good morning to you too, Lee.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.590
Just popped into use the bog,
I came out and it had gone!

10:06.640 --> 10:08.830
Oh for God's sake.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.030
Well don't blame me! I
didn't fucking nick it!

10:11.080 --> 10:13.390
All right, what's the tail plate?

10:13.440 --> 10:14.830
The registration number?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.910
Well, they can't have gone far.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.870
I mean, how long were you
in the bog? A few minutes?

10:18.920 --> 10:20.910
No, it was a bit longer than that.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.390
You know, quite a stubborn... bowel, shit.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.470
- Good, good. - How does someone
manage to get the car started?

10:26.520 --> 10:27.870
Must've hot-wired it. I'm on it.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.670
Or they could've found a spare
key under the sun visor?

10:30.720 --> 10:33.430
Why would you put the spare key there?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.710
So it's easy to find. It's
there with the house key.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.760
So whoever nicked my car can
now get into our house as well?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.590
- Tremendous!
- Calm down!

10:41.640 --> 10:44.350
It's not as if I wrote the
address on the key ring!

10:44.400 --> 10:46.430
Don't fucking tell me to calm down.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.190
Our home address is programmed
into the satnav, you twazzock!

10:50.240 --> 10:52.870
- What's happened?
- Someone's nicked my fucking car!

10:52.920 --> 10:54.950
I'll phone the cops, all right?!

10:55.000 --> 10:56.430
I've done it. The lads are onto it.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.910
Rose, I'll personally make sure
whoever did this gets banged up.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.150
Has anyone seen Limahl?

11:01.200 --> 11:03.310
Oh.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.590
What, what? Oh, no, no, no!

11:06.640 --> 11:08.750
No! He wouldn't do a thing like that!

11:08.800 --> 11:09.990
He's 14! He's a baby!

11:10.040 --> 11:11.750
He threw all your
furniture out the window!

11:11.800 --> 11:12.950
And he wanked into that cake!

11:13.000 --> 11:15.430
Yes, but this would be
totally out of character!

11:15.480 --> 11:17.670
Limahl, Limahl!

11:17.720 --> 11:21.720
Please, please, please,
please, not my Limahl!

11:22.440 --> 11:25.500
Limahl! Limahl!

11:25.820 --> 11:29.550
- Fucking Lee.
- Cut the ties. Divorce him.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.950
He's like an albatross in
Primark trackie bottoms.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.350
How's this happened to my life?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.190
How's this happened to any of us?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.950
I was supposed to be a
famous author by now.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.030
A place in the South of
France, Booker shortlist.

11:41.080 --> 11:44.110
Groupies desperate for you to
write a haiku on their knockers?

11:44.160 --> 11:46.510
Yes! Exactly that.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.910
So, did Dennis confirm his
sister's sexual fluidity?

11:49.960 --> 11:53.030
Oh, don't put Denise's fluids in my head.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.070
No, Denise has moved on.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.230
Hazel, her ex-girlfriend,

11:57.280 --> 12:01.280
and who also worked for the
council in bulky waste...

12:03.200 --> 12:05.070
Oh, is that an actual thing?

12:05.120 --> 12:07.030
- It is real.
- Bulky waste?

12:07.080 --> 12:09.310
Yes. It should be the name of a shop where

12:09.360 --> 12:11.990
I buy my clothes, as well, really.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.630
But Hazel, she won't leave Denise alone.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.190
Sexually obsessed, apparently.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.710
Oh, sweet. Like Fred and Rose West.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.870
Right. Yep.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.590
OK, yeah. Great, thank you.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.110
The lads have got Limahl
down at the station. He's OK.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.830
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.910
Let's hope nobody wants to press charges.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.750
You're lucky. Could've been carnage.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.030
I grew up with boys like him.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.990
They can smell your fear.
You need to get a grip.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.950
- Teach him who's in charge.
- Right. - Otherwise...

12:43.000 --> 12:44.390
I'll be around at your flat.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.390
I was hoping to be invited because
you've been missing for days.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.070
You'll be on the floor,

12:49.120 --> 12:52.630
shank in your neck,
dead. Blood everywhere.

12:52.680 --> 12:56.680
I've seen it before.
Well, not exactly that.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.550
Same thing with this Mehmet family.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.430
Don't let them smell you.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.480
Your fear, not you.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.270
Just... man up.

13:08.320 --> 13:12.320
- Or woman up.
- OK.

13:16.320 --> 13:20.320
- Hello, fellas.
- Gentlemen. - Nice pipes.

13:20.720 --> 13:24.590
Are either of you Mr Mehmet?

13:24.640 --> 13:28.640
He's inside, I think.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.990
Good day for it.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.150
Mr Mehmet?

13:39.200 --> 13:43.200
I'm Nitin Palavan from
Children's Services.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.270
- Oh, oh!
- Careful, Nitin.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.470
Just get out of here!

13:47.520 --> 13:50.110
- Just get out of here.
- Erm... Er...

13:50.160 --> 13:53.950
Come on!

13:54.000 --> 13:57.310
- Ingrid! - Now, I'm... I'm
sure you've all got a very

13:57.360 --> 13:59.950
good reason for trying to
intimidate myself and my colleague.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.150
Perhaps you've been persecuted,
or you've got very small penises.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.750
I, I, all I care about is, is that child,

14:05.800 --> 14:09.800
and why she isn't at school.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.990
Yes, we do want to press charges!

14:14.040 --> 14:15.590
That car's my livelihood!

14:15.640 --> 14:18.510
And I'm going to lose a whole day's
fares, if you don't get this sorted.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.870
How much damage is there?

14:19.920 --> 14:23.670
Oh, not much to the car, but he
totalled two council wheelie bins.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.390
Drove into a recycling bank.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.710
Can't your lads just give him
a good copper's bollocking,

14:27.760 --> 14:30.710
and then we all move on? No?

14:30.760 --> 14:34.550
There is something else that
you might find a bit, erm...

14:34.600 --> 14:36.670
- .. upsetting.
- Oh, God.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.150
A dead body in the back?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.310
- Worse. - You know, I'm
wondering if we need to have...

14:40.360 --> 14:43.070
I don't know how it got there,
but when we opened the boot,

14:43.120 --> 14:47.120
we found nine large,
plastic bottles of urine,

14:47.680 --> 14:51.680
and, roughly, eight Tupperware boxes of...

14:52.560 --> 14:54.430
.. human faecal shit.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.480
- That's quite an unusual
packed lunch, isn't it? - Mm.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.230
All right, don't, don't
worry. I won't tell Denise

15:02.280 --> 15:04.030
and everyone that you ran away.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.830
I didn't. It was a tactical move.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.030
I was running away to get help,

15:08.080 --> 15:10.630
but, for the record, you should probably

15:10.680 --> 15:13.510
- give me the lowdown on
what you saw in there. - OK.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.030
Narcotics, shooters,
butterfly knives, drones?

15:17.080 --> 15:19.070
- No.
- Hi-tech ammunition?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.790
Just, er, some women

15:21.840 --> 15:24.270
and babies, and the little girl.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.110
She's a selective mute,

15:26.160 --> 15:27.630
so, she's not been talking,

15:27.680 --> 15:29.910
and that's why the Mehmets
have taken her out of school.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.270
They were definitely up to
something. We should keep them

15:32.320 --> 15:34.790
on high alert. By the way, when
did you learn to speak Turkish?

15:34.840 --> 15:37.350
- Oh, gap year.
- You, you went on a gap year?

15:37.400 --> 15:39.590
No. No, no, I just
worked in Gap for a year.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.990
- Oh, makes sense.
- Yeah, for a Turkish manager.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.030
I didn't, didn't really need
to learn Turkish, because,

15:45.080 --> 15:49.080
- mainly, we just spoke the
international language of sex. - What?

15:55.360 --> 15:57.550
Hi, Nat. Martin had to
go off to a meeting,

15:57.600 --> 15:59.430
but he told me to come
and give you a hand.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.480
I'm fine, and I prefer to be called
Natalie by people I don't know.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.590
We've met before, but,
erm, I actually wanted

16:07.640 --> 16:08.950
to give you some advice.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.910
I was just wondering if you'd ever
thought about recording the meetings

16:11.960 --> 16:14.670
and doing a digital transcript, instead?

16:14.720 --> 16:16.710
It was just a suggestion,
because you, you always

16:16.760 --> 16:19.790
look like you're struggling with
the notes. I'm not criticising.

16:19.840 --> 16:23.470
I couldn't do it. My nan told
me, "Never learn to touch types,

16:23.520 --> 16:25.590
"so that nobody can
make you be a secretary."

16:25.640 --> 16:29.640
I am not a secretary. I am
the executive assistant.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.350
Have I upset you? Is it to do with Martin?

16:33.400 --> 16:35.870
You've, you've got a bit
of a soft spot for him.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.350
- MFY...
- Sorry?

16:38.400 --> 16:42.400
- MFYOB.
- I don't know what that means.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.510
Mind your own...

16:44.560 --> 16:47.670
Look, you could get Martin
struck off if Denise finds out

16:47.720 --> 16:51.030
- you're living at his flat.
- It's platonic, and it's temporary.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.430
It's not right.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.990
Nothing's been right in this
department since you turned up.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.470
Oh, dear, did I just say that out loud?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.270
- Let's not do this.
- Do what?

16:58.320 --> 16:59.710
You feel threatened by me.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.790
Not your fault. Denise
should be across this.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.710
Female rivalry is so fuelled
by workplace culture.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.589
We're set up to compete.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.790
You're right. Let's not compete.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.550
Looked you up on Facebook, and I've got

17:12.599 --> 17:16.599
loads more friends than you.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.630
I don't get any time for a toilet break!

17:19.680 --> 17:21.510
So, you made an executive decision

17:21.560 --> 17:23.150
to dump in my Tupperware?

17:23.200 --> 17:25.470
I'm trying to picture the charming scene.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.829
Right, sir, we'd better get
you down to the station

17:27.880 --> 17:29.750
to pick up those car keys...

17:29.800 --> 17:31.430
.. and the excrement.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.390
What would I want with that?

17:33.440 --> 17:35.910
Well, don't think we want it either, mate!

17:35.960 --> 17:39.750
Where are we with that
child with dental issues?

17:39.800 --> 17:42.710
He's stopped eating. His
teeth are too painful.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.670
So, dentist fears malnutrition,
needs to extract under a general.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.790
Well, look, I have some really
fun therapies with sock puppets

17:49.840 --> 17:52.230
that we could try, it might
get him flossing, at least.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.390
Why were his teeth allowed to decay?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.110
Because they've never seen a toothbrush.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.710
He's from a traveller community.
His mum doesn't believe in it.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.870
- Oh, they're manky, them crusties.
- Oh, here we go.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.990
I actually have mates in
the traveller community.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.150
Well, we really want a
traveller site, right?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.350
I found this bloke smashed
off his tits drinking milk

18:07.400 --> 18:09.830
- straight from a cow's udder.
- Wow! - Why is that weird?

18:09.880 --> 18:11.270
It's probably better for you.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.230
Excuse me? Wolf's got holes in
his teeth down to the jawbone.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.150
All right, court order.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.270
Make a note, please,
for the legals, Natalie.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.990
I'm not writing it down
today. I'm recording it!

18:22.040 --> 18:24.470
- On your phone?
- Yeah. I'll transcribe it later.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.950
That is not at all appropriate.
It could end up on the Cloud.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.270
- Please delete it.
- I haven't got anything else with me.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.830
I haven't got my laptop.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.630
- Shall I take written notes?
- Yes.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.680
Ingrid, how was the client visit
to the Mehmet household? Ingrid?

18:40.560 --> 18:43.270
Don't tell me she's cried off
again with some gynae bollocks.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.550
- No, she's had to...
- Oh, no, Ingrid... Ingrid had to

18:45.600 --> 18:48.990
- go down to the...
- To go to the police station...

18:49.040 --> 18:51.190
To collect Limahl...

18:51.240 --> 18:53.950
- Who's her foster-son... - Who's her
foster son... - .. and she had...

18:54.000 --> 18:56.470
- .. and she had to go...
- .. that's why she's not at the meeting.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.520
- .. out of the meeting.
- Oh, God! We'll have to get Nitin in.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.640
Nitin!

19:08.720 --> 19:10.830
- Sorry.
- All right, Nitin.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.350
Can you talk us through today?

19:12.400 --> 19:14.710
- Why, what have you heard?
- Nothing.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.950
Jesus, calm down. We're not
going to water board you.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.470
- I know that Mehmet geezer. Psycho.
- You cannot say '"psycho'.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.270
He was sectioned. So, aye, I can.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.510
- You still can't.
- Can.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.390
We're going to find an
interpreter for the little girl,

19:27.440 --> 19:30.030
and, er, liaise with the school
to ensure regular attendance.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.310
Where are we with that parent that
you found drunk in the supermarket?

19:33.360 --> 19:35.710
Zach Stott. Yeah, I found

19:35.760 --> 19:38.790
a substance resembling a
class A drug at his house,

19:38.840 --> 19:40.350
and the baby could easily ingest it,

19:40.400 --> 19:42.670
so I sent it to my mate in forensics.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.710
Forensics? Are we in Line Of Duty?

19:44.760 --> 19:46.910
- Just dip your finger in it.
- We didn't all live through

19:46.960 --> 19:48.430
the heady 1980s, Al,

19:48.480 --> 19:50.670
and sending it to forensics is protocol.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.430
And it did turn out to be cocaine,

19:52.480 --> 19:54.630
so there are safeguarding issues.

19:54.680 --> 19:58.470
Oh, great news. So, litigious
posh twat is back on the books.

19:58.520 --> 20:01.510
Right, well, can we wrap
up this session, please?

20:01.560 --> 20:05.030
Actually, no. Got a case of historic abuse

20:05.080 --> 20:06.830
against a local football coach.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.950
Elm Heath Strollers?
Yeah, I know this case.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.270
The complainant is saying
he reported it at the time,

20:12.320 --> 20:14.910
- but it was not followed up.
- No, I was a junior here at the time,

20:14.960 --> 20:16.750
and I can assure you, if it was reported,

20:16.800 --> 20:18.790
it would most definitely
have been followed up.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.790
It was reported by the boy, now
an adult, but not followed up.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.990
- Check your files.
- Darin. He came in today.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.270
Right. Natalie, call up the
relevant data, psychologist reports,

20:27.320 --> 20:28.830
educational, medical records...

20:28.880 --> 20:31.710
I bloody can't. That's what I've
been trying to tell you. I can't!

20:31.760 --> 20:35.760
- Calm down, Nat.
- No, you calm down, Miss know-it-all Face!

20:35.880 --> 20:38.350
A load of data from the
late 80s has gone missing.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.400
It wasn't digitised,
and there are no files.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.190
Right. Well, thank you for
alerting us, PC Harris.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.950
- We will get back to you.
- Hey, hey, hey!

20:47.000 --> 20:50.030
Not good enough. The
ball's back in your court,

20:50.080 --> 20:52.430
and I'm ticking it off me list.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.150
- Yes! - Well, Natalie will keep
searching through the hard copy,

20:55.200 --> 20:58.190
- as well as finding...
- I will not be humping data or lifting

20:58.240 --> 21:00.110
heavy box files, and
I'm not doing it because

21:00.160 --> 21:04.160
I'm having a B-A-B-B-Y-A-Y...

21:04.240 --> 21:08.240
- A babbyay?
- A fucking baby!

21:12.840 --> 21:16.840
Very annoying. I was on the
verge of letting her go.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.270
Here you go, a nice minty tea.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.990
Here's a cushion for under your feet.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.870
Oh, my God, don't treat her like
an invalid. She's just pregnant.

21:24.920 --> 21:28.070
- I'm enjoying the fuss.
- And it's wonderful news.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.910
Didn't know you had a gentleman caller.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.910
- Who's the lucky chap?
- I can't really say.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.750
Oh, it's a multiple partner situation?

21:36.800 --> 21:40.800
Look, I'm in a stable, committed
relationship with a man.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.790
We're very happy,

21:42.840 --> 21:46.190
but we're keeping it quiet for now...

21:46.240 --> 21:50.240
.. cos he hasn't quite told his wife yet.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.710
To what do I owe this pleasure?

21:58.760 --> 22:02.760
Well, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry about today.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.720
All right, but don't be
such a twat in the future.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.430
What happened to that hundred
weight of shit in the boot?

22:14.480 --> 22:16.990
Oh, down the bog. It took hours,

22:17.040 --> 22:19.990
but, after which, I put all of
the Tupperware in the dishwasher,

22:20.040 --> 22:23.190
and I made loads of frozen
meals for you and the kids.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.870
You put food in those containers?

22:24.920 --> 22:27.950
Yes. I thought that would
put a smile on your face.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
Pull over, will you?

22:33.680 --> 22:34.950
Where the hell's this?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.090
What?

22:39.140 --> 22:41.110
Out! You fuckwit!

22:41.160 --> 22:42.670
Go on, piss off. Out!

22:42.720 --> 22:44.590
For goodness' sake,
you're such a drama queen!

22:44.640 --> 22:45.790
You useless piece of crap.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.350
- I haven't done anything, apart
from clear up... - Oh, bollocks!

22:49.400 --> 22:53.400
- .. make food, try and make
things all right! - Fuck off!

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
Thanks, Mum.
