00:10.240 --> 00:11.080
Where are you?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.720
Hello!

01:22.360 --> 01:26.440
THE DAY BEFORE

01:29.120 --> 01:31.880
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:36.560 --> 01:37.840
Aureliano?

01:40.400 --> 01:41.840
They haven't found him.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.080
Piece of shit's been hiding for two days.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.560
I'll be right there.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.080
-Coffee's ready.
-No, I'm in a hurry.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.040
Shall I bring it in here?

01:57.120 --> 01:59.440
I said I'm in a hurry, go back there.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.880
I'm not going back there.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.520
I've been waiting for an answer
since yesterday.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.320
I want an answer, Alberto.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.040
You want an answer?

02:13.560 --> 02:14.640
See ya.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.320
I got stuff to do, I'll be back late.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.680
What a surprise.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.160
I haven't seen you for two days.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.360
Isabel, please, don't you start.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.920
I got a lot of shit going on.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.880
I was really fucking dumb
to move in with you.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.320
What's going on?

02:53.880 --> 02:55.240
Ask your sister.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.720
What the fuck did my sister do?

02:58.040 --> 02:59.120
Nothing.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.720
She came here and told me the truth.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.760
That you're like your father,
that you like black hookers,

03:07.200 --> 03:10.760
you set them up in an apartment,
but in the end they're still hookers.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.640
And you believed her?

03:20.840 --> 03:22.360
Know what I think?

03:22.440 --> 03:25.720
That you brought me here just
to piss off your sister,

03:26.960 --> 03:30.480
but I'm not anybody's plaything,
least of all yours.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.480
Look at me.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.040
Look at me.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.720
I just want you to be all right.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.960
I'll take care of Livia, okay?

04:00.120 --> 04:01.600
You've got a problem, Livia,

04:02.200 --> 04:03.520
your brother.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.600
He's sticking his nose into things
that don't concern him.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.160
My plans for Ostia.

04:12.360 --> 04:17.680
Not only for your land,
but the Vatican land, too.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.959
And I'll give you some more bad news,

04:20.399 --> 04:23.320
he's doing it with
that other dickhead Alberto Anacleti.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.240
-What are you talking about?
-You heard me.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.120
They've teamed up,
your brother and Spadino.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.640
I haven't got time to waste,
either you take care of it or I will,

04:34.720 --> 04:36.240
let me know what you decide.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.640
Remember I had a deal with your father.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.320
Another death.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.600
Is that enough for you now?

05:12.640 --> 05:15.920
ROME CITY HALL MANAGER KILLS HIMSELF

05:37.040 --> 05:39.080
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.280
Okay.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.440
-Okay...
-Go with Mommy.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.400
-Speak to you later.
-Bye, Vittoria. Bye, Fabrizio.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.400
Did you hear about Finucci?

05:51.920 --> 05:53.560
Yes, what about it?

05:54.400 --> 05:57.760
-You came all this way to say that?
-Finucci had a clean record.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.760
He only had to plea bargain,

05:59.840 --> 06:02.200
and he wouldn't have done
a single day in jail.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.520
-He had no reason to kill himself.
-Sometimes shame is enough.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.520
What shame? People like Finucci
don't even know what shame is.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.320
The situation's getting too risky,
you're not made for this.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.720
Look, Finucci killed himself
because of personal shit.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.160
Be careful, can't you see what's going on?
Get out while you can.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.680
I appreciate that you're so worried
about me, but there's no need.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.480
Hi.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.880
All good.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.280
Have you come to tell me
why the fuck you're dicking around

06:54.360 --> 06:56.440
with gypsies on our turf?

07:00.200 --> 07:03.000
No, I don't have to explain anything
to you.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.960
You're right, it's best not to waste time
with explanations,

07:07.040 --> 07:09.640
so just cut out this bullshit.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.080
Now.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.440
And come back here to your family
and look after our business.

07:16.440 --> 07:20.280
There's no room for both of us here,
look how many are already here.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.280
Right, he's got better things to do
with that black slut.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.480
Listen, Livia, come here...

07:29.600 --> 07:32.120
Don't you dare set foot
in my house ever again.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.000
Keep your nose out of my business,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.680
because I didn't even take orders
from my father,

07:40.720 --> 07:43.280
so imagine how much
I give a shit about what you say.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.840
And remember this:
for as long as I breathe,

07:51.200 --> 07:54.520
Samurai can't look at our land,
not even from a distance.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.280
Bye, Livia.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.760
Get the fuck outta my way.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.760
The change of title.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.720
The land is yours.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.720
Praise where praise is due,

08:30.800 --> 08:32.559
you fought right to the end.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.679
Unfortunately for you,
you took on the wrong guy.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.120
I took on someone who's prepared to kill.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.360
You want to kill me too, after Finucci?

08:48.080 --> 08:50.880
Women shouldn't be hit,
not even with a flower.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.080
Livia, you need to make up your mind.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.080
-What are you talking about?
-About Aureliano.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.200
You need to be done with him.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.520
I'm not talking about sibling rivalry,
I'm talking about business.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.480
I'm talking about what your father built

09:29.560 --> 09:32.040
and what your brother tries
to destroy every day.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.440
He's in business with an Anacleti.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.120
When are you going to stop him?

09:38.200 --> 09:39.680
Explain it to me.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.360
What do you think I should do?

09:47.040 --> 09:49.000
-I don't know.
-There you go.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.040
All I know is that he can't be
a problem for you,

09:52.120 --> 09:54.200
you need to be free to do what you want

09:54.280 --> 09:56.920
and not spend every day fixing
the mess he makes.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.200
So?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.400
So, what?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.040
Keep out of it,

10:22.800 --> 10:24.800
this is our business.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.720
What do you want, Cinaglia?
I'm sick of all this talking.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.520
Time's running out.
I don't want to hear any more excuses.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.200
It's not that simple.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.400
-Now there's a dead man.
-That doesn't concern you.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.280
The deal's clear,

11:02.040 --> 11:04.000
and now all I want is results.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.120
How did Finucci die?

11:09.280 --> 11:13.040
-He didn't commit suicide...
-Well, you ought to know.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.600
You came to tell me
that Finucci spoke to Monaschi.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.040
Don't be naive,

11:20.400 --> 11:24.040
what happened to Finucci,
we did it together, you and me.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.360
We're accomplices

11:27.080 --> 11:28.760
and business partners.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.080
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.800
You're hiding like a rat.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.560
Nice try.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.920
Go that way.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.320
He's not here.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.440
I'm sorry, Spadino, I'm so sorry.

13:22.080 --> 13:22.920
Lele?

13:25.040 --> 13:26.280
Don't do anything stupid.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.120
Give me the gun.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.280
Keep away.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.040
I said stay away.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.000
You don't understand,
I didn't have a choice.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.920
-You're not capable of killing anyone.
-Stay the fuck away!

13:39.000 --> 13:41.480
-Shoot him in the face.
-Shut up!

13:51.320 --> 13:52.320
Look, Lele...

14:01.800 --> 14:04.080
We're friends, right? Gimme the gun.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.280
Give it to me.

14:11.880 --> 14:15.360
Piece of shit!

14:17.840 --> 14:19.480
Fuck!

14:30.080 --> 14:32.640
What's Livia doing?
Sending me an emissary?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.400
I'm here to solve a problem
that concerns you too.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.600
And what's that?

14:41.240 --> 14:42.440
Aureliano.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.280
I gave everything to Samurai.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.280
They're looking for you.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.680
I don't care.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.320
"I'm downstairs. I need to talk to you."

15:31.040 --> 15:32.520
End it.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.720
Then I'll do it!

15:59.080 --> 16:03.560
I've come to tell you that your affair
with my wife is over,

16:03.640 --> 16:05.760
and she gave the Vatican land to Samurai.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.240
Our dealings end here

16:09.400 --> 16:10.840
and yours too, I think.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.360
You're young,

16:17.440 --> 16:20.200
find a girl your own age who loves you,

16:21.280 --> 16:22.880
who doesn't want too much.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.920
Sara will never give you
what you're looking for.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.400
She's not capable of it.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.280
Trust me.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.079
I want to go to Africa.

17:21.359 --> 17:23.440
I want to make enough money
to stay there,

17:23.520 --> 17:25.800
because there,
no one calls me a filthy black whore

17:25.880 --> 17:27.360
like your bitch of a sister did.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.200
My sister's not a problem anymore.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.720
She understands she needs
to stay in her place.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.680
I don't want to live without you,

17:44.680 --> 17:46.320
trust me a little.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.360
Then, I promise I'll take you to Africa.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.320
I'll take you to Kenya,
to the best resort.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.720
But I'm not from Kenya.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.920
Whatever, it's all the same,
because we'll come back here anyway.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.680
To our home.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.920
Where's your brother?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.160
What's my brother got to do with anything?

18:11.440 --> 18:13.840
If you want to expand
and can't control your brother,

18:13.920 --> 18:15.200
you're off to a bad start.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.760
Be clear.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.400
Spadino's in business
with Aureliano Adami.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.880
They're plotting about
the Ostia land I'm interested in.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.880
What the fuck are you saying?
With that scum?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.640
What business? How long?

18:31.040 --> 18:35.240
Manfredi, I can't explain stuff to you
that you can't figure out on your own.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.480
There's only one solution,

18:38.680 --> 18:40.520
go get Aureliano Adami.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.880
I'll tell you where and when.

18:45.920 --> 18:49.400
Citrus is very fashionable right now.
You've picked an excellent scent.

18:49.480 --> 18:52.680
-Thanks. Bye, see you next time.
-Bye, thank you.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.640
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.840
What is it?

19:05.480 --> 19:07.040
I'm sorry about this morning.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.720
I didn't know Gabriella was coming by.

19:10.280 --> 19:14.000
She's your ex-wife. It's only normal
you have stuff to say to each other.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.400
Unless there's something else between you.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.880
-No, there isn't.
-So?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.920
You didn't come by just for this...

19:30.640 --> 19:32.720
Look, I read the papers too,

19:33.440 --> 19:35.040
Giacomo Finucci...

19:35.480 --> 19:37.160
He's the guy who worked with you.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.840
Are you afraid of something?

19:46.120 --> 19:47.840
It's difficult to explain.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.640
You don't have to explain it to me.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.160
I want to know if you're afraid.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.600
No, I'm not afraid.

19:54.680 --> 19:55.760
Good.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.720
Well, I want to tell you something.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.760
You've always been a good politician,

20:06.080 --> 20:07.480
a good man,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.440
but that wasn't enough for you
to get what you wanted.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.760
I don't want
to see you frustrated anymore,

20:17.080 --> 20:18.640
I want you to be happy.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.040
For me and for your kids,
this is the only thing that matters.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.320
So, do what you have to do,

20:34.240 --> 20:36.000
whatever it takes.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.040
I've got to work.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.360
I love you.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.120
-Hello.
-Hello.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.440
We'd like to try some jasmine essence...

21:22.000 --> 21:25.200
-Where are you going? Come here.
-What the fuck are you doing?

21:25.280 --> 21:28.240
Don't you dare do anything
with Aureliano Adami again.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.600
He killed your cousin Boris.
I can't forgive him or you for that.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.520
So?

21:44.240 --> 21:46.280
Say it!

21:47.080 --> 21:48.480
Look at yourself.

21:48.560 --> 21:51.440
You're not good at controlling
your brother, let alone running things.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.760
-What's in your head?
-To do what the fuck I want.

21:57.040 --> 22:00.280
Without having to answer to you
and this fucking family.

22:04.160 --> 22:08.160
From today, I'm a free man, and I decide
what to do with my life, got that?

22:11.240 --> 22:14.360
So long, everybody, Spadino's outta here.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.800
You need to be strong, Lele.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.800
This is a lousy job,

22:52.360 --> 22:54.280
don't do it, take it from me.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.480
Forget your father's dreams.

22:59.320 --> 23:02.120
Go get some rest.
Want me to take you home?

23:03.360 --> 23:04.600
No.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.320
It's okay.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.960
Lele.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.680
Hi.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.200
This is the stuff your father kept
in his office.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.240
You'll need to wait for the rest.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.880
They're emptying out the locker
but they need more time,

23:45.960 --> 23:47.880
because they have to log everything.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.840
Okay.

23:50.440 --> 23:51.640
You want a coffee?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.080
No.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.160
Were you at my house?

24:15.320 --> 24:18.040
I saw your scarf there.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.520
Were you and my father together?

24:24.920 --> 24:25.880
Yes.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.280
For how long?

24:33.360 --> 24:34.560
Over ten years.

24:37.720 --> 24:38.720
He never told me.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.000
Because it was never the right moment.

24:46.640 --> 24:49.000
After what you went through
when your mother left,

24:49.080 --> 24:52.080
Franco didn't want to risk
making you suffer again.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.160
He was the one
who didn't want me to see her.

24:56.240 --> 25:01.200
No, Lele,
that's what he wanted you to think.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.800
You don't know how many times
he tried to convince her

25:03.880 --> 25:05.080
to see you at least once.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.080
I'm sorry.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.600
Franco loved you more
than anything else in the world.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.720
You heard anything?

25:47.080 --> 25:50.520
-That rat's hiding.
-Don't worry, we'll find him.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.960
We'll find him.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.160
The fuck's so funny?

25:54.800 --> 25:59.120
I got a weight off my back,
I told my brother to fuck off.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.480
Who cares?!
We killed a cop, and Lele fucked us.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.320
We need to eliminate him.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.440
What the fuck do you care?

26:06.520 --> 26:09.840
We're in business with Sara Monaschi.
We're going to get the Ostia land

26:09.920 --> 26:11.520
and make it big time.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.880
And fuck my brother,
fuck your sister and Lele, too.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.000
Yeah, calm down, it's not a done deal.

26:19.040 --> 26:22.200
Maybe Monaschi is in cahoots with Lele,

26:22.280 --> 26:23.960
nothing to be happy about.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.080
Turn that fucking music down!

26:26.160 --> 26:28.800
Turn it down? We need to turn it up!

26:28.880 --> 26:30.240
Turn it up!

26:31.560 --> 26:32.600
Come on, Spadino.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.400
Come on, we're about to hit the big time!

26:38.480 --> 26:42.000
We'll take all of Ostia
and turn it into Las Vegas.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.120
-It's me and you.
-You can do it on your own.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.440
No, we're stronger together.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.640
The fuck are you doing?

26:54.600 --> 26:56.080
I was playing.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.720
And what game is that?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.600
Fuckin' fag, what game is that?

27:21.280 --> 27:23.120
You changed my life, Aureliano.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.680
The fuck are you talking about?

27:34.360 --> 27:36.600
People like you make me sick.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.800
Don't touch me.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.680
Soon I'll get something I really want.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.520
I'm happy for you.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.000
You should do it too.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.600
And do what?

29:15.840 --> 29:17.760
I haven't even got a husband anymore.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.840
Spadino will be back, I guarantee it.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.960
For anything you need,
you're part of the family now.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.520
You should have a baby.
It's important for a woman.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.800
It'll happen soon. You'll see.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.840
I would have given you fifty kids.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.480
You want your keys back?

30:21.680 --> 30:22.880
Here.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.680
I heard about your father.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.720
You're taking a big risk.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.360
Your husband's really pissed.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.640
I just wanted to give you a hug.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.120
Since he died, everyone wants to hug me.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.080
I always treated him like shit...

31:09.960 --> 31:11.920
but the real piece of shit was me.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.600
I never listened to him,

31:18.320 --> 31:20.800
and now it's too late
to tell him I'm sorry.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.160
A father doesn't want an apology
from his son.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.360
Garlic, oil and chili.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.960
-Don't you like it?
-Yeah.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.880
You don't know what you're missing.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.560
What are you thinking about?

32:09.800 --> 32:11.840
A friend who pissed me off.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.880
-Were you right?
-Of course.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.680
If you're still thinking about it,
you're not so sure.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.120
Quirino, what the fuck do you want?

32:37.160 --> 32:38.320
All right.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.880
My sister's boyfriend says Livia's waiting
at the gym.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.480
I won't be long.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.600
Give me a kiss.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.800
-What do you want?
-To talk.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.040
-We've already said everything.
-I don't think so.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.760
I'm busy, Cinaglia, hurry up.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.320
You said once I was in,

33:46.200 --> 33:48.040
I couldn't turn back.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.120
And I'm not turning back,
on the contrary,

33:51.440 --> 33:52.960
I'm going to go all the way.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.480
If you're going to do something,
do it properly, right?

33:58.040 --> 33:59.320
What do you want?

33:59.800 --> 34:02.160
I want to talk to the guys behind you,

34:03.760 --> 34:05.280
I want to meet the Mafia.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.719
And what do you want to say to them?

34:12.239 --> 34:15.320
That I want to be
their point person in City Hall.

34:26.639 --> 34:29.760
Put the other shoes back on,
these don't suit you.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.920
I've got Taccon in the palm of my hand,

34:38.679 --> 34:40.400
and he still hasn't signed.

34:41.639 --> 34:43.159
You blackmailing me?

34:43.760 --> 34:45.199
You call it blackmail,

34:46.120 --> 34:48.080
I call it business partners.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.640
And what are you doing here?

34:58.920 --> 35:01.720
-Where are you going?
-I need to talk to my brother.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.760
He just went out
to go meet you at the gym.

35:04.840 --> 35:07.200
-What are you talking about?
-Quirino called.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.640
Isn't he your boyfriend?

35:08.720 --> 35:10.760
-How long ago?
-Not long.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.920
Where are you?

35:40.960 --> 35:43.960
Aureliano, you're not even
going to offer us a coffee?

35:46.840 --> 35:48.240
Go that way.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.080
Don't shoot!

36:09.280 --> 36:10.520
Bring it, gypsy scum!

36:13.040 --> 36:14.440
I've got him!

37:41.800 --> 37:42.880
Aureliano!

37:44.160 --> 37:45.400
Aureliano!

38:26.600 --> 38:28.640
One thing you weren't to do in my house...

38:29.520 --> 38:31.120
touch a hair on my brother's head.

38:31.680 --> 38:35.360
I know, but I did it for us.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.080
I loved you, Livia.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.640
A lot.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.240
I'm only sorry I didn't realize I was
in this by myself.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.520
You're born alone. You die alone.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.600
You should know that.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.840
