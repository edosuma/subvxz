I'm gonna go pick up
my colorblind glasses from USC.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.252

Now, these glasses allow

to see color.

commissioned a new negligee,
custom-made

to get me into that.

I get it enough from Jess's dad.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.549

I almost asked her at the park,

02:55.131 --> 02:57.002
but a squirrel
ran off with our ring.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.700
Don't worry,
I got the ring back, but let me

02:58.743 --> 03:00.702
just say this, the squirrel
will never do that again.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.660
And then I got us on
the kiss cam at Dodger Stadium.

the old guy next to me.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.571
No.

08:04.614 --> 08:09.097
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.664
What do you dislike strongly?

08:10.707 --> 08:12.230
Is this guy rocking
a jean jacket?

08:12.274 --> 08:13.754
Unfortunately, yes.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.320
I don't hate that!

08:15.364 --> 08:16.321
-[knock on door]
-Oh, my God.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.627
She's here. She's here.

08:17.671 --> 08:18.976
I feel ready. I feel ready.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.588
-Why are you acting so weird?
-I'm not acting weird.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.154
Winston, will you come with me?

08:23.198 --> 08:25.809
I'd love to be the first person
to show you a raincoat.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.681
I knew something was going on
with raincoats.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.987
-Hmm.
-Watch out. Excuse me, baby.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.599
What's wrong, Schmidt?
You look green. Is it green?

08:32.642 --> 08:34.775
Cece wants
to get pregnant again.

08:34.818 --> 08:35.732
Oh.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.997
[whimpers softly]

08:40.041 --> 08:41.477
Ms. Day, Mr. Miller.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.914
I'm hoping
the second time's the charm.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.003
I'd like to introduce Mario.

08:46.047 --> 08:49.790
-Mario. -You're squeezing
real hard, Jess.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.182
Your pictures
don't do you justice.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.794
-[chuckles]
-Will you excuse me a minute?

08:53.837 --> 08:55.752
-[laughs]
-Very excited.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.062
[muffled screaming]

09:03.891 --> 09:06.850
Cece wants to get pregnant?
Isn't that good news?

09:06.894 --> 09:08.373
Don't you want, like,
a hundred kids?

09:08.417 --> 09:10.027
Yes, I do. I just...

09:10.071 --> 09:13.465
How can I survive another
nine months of pregnant Cece?

09:13.509 --> 09:15.598
She was so mean to me.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.819
I got your wings, my love.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.952
I wanted all flats, no drumlets!

09:21.996 --> 09:23.954
-Do they look flat to you?!
-[muffled grunting]

09:23.998 --> 09:25.434
Do they look flat to you?!

09:25.477 --> 09:27.784
She tried to jam
the business end of a drumlet

09:27.828 --> 09:29.307
straight up my tuchus.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.005
And then things got worse.

09:31.048 --> 09:33.747
I can only describe
what I experienced next as...

09:33.790 --> 09:35.400
anti-Semitic.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.011
Hey, gefilte face!

09:37.054 --> 09:38.229
Quit playing
"Where's My Foreskin?"

09:38.273 --> 09:39.883
and get in here and rub my feet

09:39.927 --> 09:43.104
before I divorce your
Yentl-loving, Ashkenazi ass!

09:43.147 --> 09:44.758
[sighs]

09:44.801 --> 09:46.542
I knew this day
would come, but...

09:46.586 --> 09:48.196
just thought I had more time.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.414
Schmidt,
you're being crazy, man.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.894
Just go talk to your wife
about this.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.548
I can't do that.
My only option is

09:52.592 --> 09:54.463
to knock her up and then
disappear into the night.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.856
I'm gonna need you and Nick

09:55.899 --> 09:57.684
to take care of my family
while I'm in hiding.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.120
Hey, be honest with her.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.774
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:00.817 --> 10:03.777
I'm off to stare at my tongue
in the mirror.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.909
So, as you can see,
we have lots of toys

10:05.953 --> 10:07.519
-for Mario to play with.
-[toy squeaking]

10:07.563 --> 10:11.045
And it looks like
he's found one he enjoys.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.221
Look at that. [sniffles]

10:13.264 --> 10:15.310
-Good for him.
-Can I just say,

10:15.353 --> 10:18.226
I had some serious doubts
about you getting a dog from us

10:18.269 --> 10:19.662
after what happened last time.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.273
You had a real
Of Mice and Menvibe.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.493
Did I? [laughs]

10:24.536 --> 10:27.061
I mean, who gets emotional

10:27.104 --> 10:30.151
-over how cute a dog is, right?
[laughs] -Oh.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.675
People with something missing
inside of them?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.416
[both laugh]

10:36.940 --> 10:39.160
Will you excuse me a minute?

10:39.203 --> 10:41.728
Mm-hmm.

10:41.771 --> 10:44.687
-Hi, cutie. [chuckles]
-[Mario whimpers]

10:44.731 --> 10:45.949
Annabelle,
you got to help me out.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.603
Mr. Miller, in 30 minutes,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.257
I'll have a barstool
and a high chair.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.259
I might be able to get you
a table, but I can't guarantee

10:51.302 --> 10:52.826
that your mariachi band
is gonna hang around.-[beep]

10:52.869 --> 10:53.740
I'm so sorry.
Can you please hold?

10:53.783 --> 10:55.045
Come on, Miller.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.786
Bob, I don't have time for this.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.483
-Clock's ticking, bub!
-I know.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.964
But the hostess just offered me
a barstool and a high chair,

11:01.008 --> 11:03.750
-and I think I have to take it.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.882
Let me talk to her.
Merge me. Merge me.

11:05.926 --> 11:09.146
You asked for it.
Here's Annabelle.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.713
Nobody say a word.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.194
Hey. I'm not doing anything.

11:13.237 --> 11:15.718
-What are you doing? -I have
to get this out of my system.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.199
[high-pitched]: Mmm!
You want to cuddle with Mommy?

11:18.242 --> 11:21.593
You want to cuddle
with Mommy?

11:21.637 --> 11:22.812
What's your name?

11:22.856 --> 11:24.814
Oh, widdle baby tired.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.338
He-wo. He-wo.
What's your name?

11:27.382 --> 11:28.862
Is it Mario?

11:28.905 --> 11:31.560
Yes, it is. Yes, it is!

11:31.603 --> 11:33.649
Okay. Okay.
I got that out of my system.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.346
Now we have to go
sign some paperwork.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.218
Paperwork for a dog?
What, are we buying or leasing?

11:37.261 --> 11:39.873
-Just get there fast, okay?
-We can do fast. I like this.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.788
We got this.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.572
[exhales]

11:43.615 --> 11:45.748
Fast, fast, fast.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.619
You guys still on the phone?

11:47.663 --> 11:48.969
Mr. Miller, I did not realize

11:49.012 --> 11:50.797
you were taking care
of a sick relative.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.799
If you can get here
in the next 30 minutes,

11:52.842 --> 11:54.757
I can squeeze you in
to a normal table.

11:54.801 --> 11:55.932
Thank you. 30 minutes.
Thank you.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.326
BOB:
Nick, go! Hey, Annabelle.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.807
Tell me, uh...
you do a nice rib eye?

12:00.850 --> 12:02.896
Oh, no. Between me and you,
it's trash.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.419
That's enough.

12:04.462 --> 12:07.030
-Cannot drink it, so I'm gonna
pour it. -[chuckles]

12:07.074 --> 12:08.466
CECE: Hey, Schmidt.
It's getting a little late.

12:08.510 --> 12:11.556
Maybe we should, you know, move
along to that second location.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.210
[sighs] Cecilia...

12:13.254 --> 12:15.430
I have something
I need to say to you.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.953
Okay.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.957
Um... first, let me say

12:21.001 --> 12:23.830
what an amazing mother and woman

12:23.873 --> 12:25.962
and partner you are.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.659
And deep down, I truly do...

12:27.703 --> 12:30.488
I truly do believe
that you are a good person.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.534
A good person who likes Jews.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.886
-You like Jews just fine.
-Schmidt?

12:36.930 --> 12:38.801
I'm nervous about us
getting pregnant again.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.021
You are?

12:41.064 --> 12:43.023
Why?

12:43.066 --> 12:44.807
Because your temperament
while pregnant

12:44.851 --> 12:47.897
is, um...

12:47.941 --> 12:49.943
Wish I had the words.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.379
-Winnie.
-Hmm?

12:51.422 --> 12:53.860
-He have the words for you?
-The words he used were

12:53.903 --> 12:55.949
-"constant terror."
-Why would you repeat that?

12:55.992 --> 12:57.689
Well, 'cause you know
I'm scared of Cece.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.474
Well, I'm sorry.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.519
I'm sorry if I was
a little bit moody

13:01.563 --> 13:04.044
while I was creating life
with my body.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.046
Aly, can you believe this?

13:06.089 --> 13:08.613
-Well...
-Well?

13:08.657 --> 13:11.878
Okay, d-don't be mad,
but I have never, ever seen

13:11.921 --> 13:14.750
anyone be pregnant the way
that you were pregnant.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.230
So much so that, for evidence,

13:16.273 --> 13:18.493
I decided to capture it
on my phone.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.277
CECE [on phone]: What genius
got us a Jolly Jumper?

13:20.321 --> 13:23.846
Who got us the Jol... Okay,
Vandana Auntie, way to go.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.109
You see, we already
have a Jolly Jumper.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.851
So put the tuna salad down.
Put it down!

13:28.895 --> 13:30.461
Tuna salad

13:30.505 --> 13:33.725
is for people
who use theregistry.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.641
Boo! Everybody boo.

13:36.685 --> 13:37.773
-Why are you not booing?!
-I honestly don't

13:37.817 --> 13:40.689
remember that.
Oh, it's okay, Cecilia.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.865
Also, thanks for
having my back, Aly.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.911
Whoa. I do not have your back.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.913
Yeah, I've also never
seen someone pregnant

13:46.956 --> 13:48.479
the way youwere pregnant.

13:48.523 --> 13:51.004
You were a coddling,
blubbering mess.

13:51.047 --> 13:54.007
Aly, come closer, I want you
to capture the luminescence

13:54.050 --> 13:56.009
-of Cece's hair.
-Shut up and keep brushing.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.880
You are a lifemaker.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.361
You have the jewel of life
inside of you.

14:00.404 --> 14:03.016
Cece, what do you need? I'll get you anything you need.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.931
You'll never
have to move again.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.715
That was hard for me to watch.

14:06.758 --> 14:10.023
-Uh, I was unbearable.
-Yeah, we both were.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.938
[chuckles] Hate to see
if you had any videos of me

14:11.981 --> 14:13.722
-in that phone,
which you don't... -I do.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.724
Mountie costume!

14:17.204 --> 14:18.727
JUDITH: Since this is
a fourth-floor loft,

14:18.770 --> 14:21.034
will you be creating
a fire plan with Mario?

14:21.077 --> 14:23.471
We'd love his input.

14:23.514 --> 14:26.082
She means yes. Man, you got
a lot of questions, Judith.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.954
And if you were on a walk
with Mario

14:27.997 --> 14:30.130
and you encountered a coyote,
what would you do?

14:30.173 --> 14:32.175
I'd run away. [chuckles]

14:32.219 --> 14:34.569
-He's joking.
-No. I mean, what I would do is

14:34.612 --> 14:36.614
I'd pick up Mario,
and thenI'd run away.

14:36.658 --> 14:40.140
And who would take Mario if
your relationship were to end?

14:40.183 --> 14:41.706
Oh, thank God. That's an
easy one. I would take him.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.187
-If we break up, I'd take him.
-What?!

14:44.231 --> 14:46.929
-You think we're gonna break up?
-I didn't say... No, no, no, no.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.149
JUDITH: You know what? I
actually... I missed a question.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.194
How do you feel about pee pads?

14:53.196 --> 14:54.981
JESS:
So in your vision of the future,

14:55.024 --> 14:57.026
we break up,
you get to take Mario,

14:57.070 --> 14:58.941
and I'm left alone
with some poop bags?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.116
-What are poop bags?
-They're the bags

15:00.160 --> 15:01.596
that you put the dog's poop in.

15:01.639 --> 15:04.381
Why would you put dog poo
in bags, Jess?

15:04.425 --> 15:05.992
It was a hypothetical question.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.950
But you answered it so quickly.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.083
Because I thought
we were trying to rush Judith.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.998
We were. I just didn't think
you'd be able

15:12.041 --> 15:13.434
to answer that question
so easily.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.305
I mean, do you see us
breaking up?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.351
No, I don't want
to break up ever. I just...

15:17.394 --> 15:19.092
-[phone ringing]
-Hold on. Sorry. -Who is that?

15:19.135 --> 15:20.963
It's just the restaurant we're
having dinner tonight, okay?

15:21.007 --> 15:23.139
-It's no big deal.
-Look, I know this might not be

15:23.183 --> 15:24.662
the most convenient time
to talk about this,

15:24.706 --> 15:26.229
but we're about
to become parents to a dog,

15:26.273 --> 15:28.579
-and I need to know we're on
the same page. -We areon

15:28.623 --> 15:30.799
the same page. I'm really sorry.
I have to answer this one.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.106
You need to take a phone call
when I'm telling you

15:33.149 --> 15:34.237
how I feel about
our relationship?

15:34.281 --> 15:36.109
You know what?
Let me take that phone call.

15:36.152 --> 15:39.068
Hello? Annabelle from Beso.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.114
Well, we're not coming.
Okay. Bye.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.812
Where were we?

15:43.855 --> 15:45.205
-You know what's crazy?
-Mm.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.771
Even after seeing
all those videos,

15:46.815 --> 15:48.860
I still want to have
another baby with you

15:48.904 --> 15:51.124
more than anything else
in the whole wide world.

15:51.167 --> 15:54.040
Me, too, more than anything.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.133
Things are gonna be
so different this time.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.222
I'm gonna give you
so much space.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.224
I'm gonna be so pro-Semitic,
that little beanie you wear

16:04.267 --> 16:05.616
on the top of your head
is gonna spin.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.054
Feels like a rough start,
but I appreciate the effort.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.838
-Let's go to the hotel.
-We're never gonna

16:09.881 --> 16:11.796
make it there and back in time
to relieve the babysitter.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.799
You know what?
I know someplace on the way.

16:14.843 --> 16:17.411
There's no way
that they're home.

16:17.454 --> 16:20.153
Nick is keeping those dinner
reservations, I guarantee it.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.503
I didn't know when and
I didn't know why, but I knew

16:22.546 --> 16:24.896
that one day I'd be having sex
in this loft again.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.943
I hope Winston's room still has
that exercise bike in it.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.076
-I have an idea.
-Mm.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.386
You wouldn't think

16:36.430 --> 16:39.128
that woman would have a urinal
in her bathroom.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.695
No, I can't go out
looking like this.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.218
-I can't stay in
looking like this. -Uh...

16:42.262 --> 16:44.438
What?! No!

16:44.481 --> 16:46.092
You seeing this?!

16:46.135 --> 16:48.224
I ain't got no sense of fashion.
You weren't gonna tell me?

16:48.268 --> 16:51.053
-I did, many times.
-Then why didn't you leave me?!

16:51.097 --> 16:53.186
I did, when you bought those
banana-yellow bird pants,

16:53.229 --> 16:55.101
but I came back
because I love you

16:55.144 --> 16:57.886
just a little more
than I hate those pants.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.889
[chuckles]

17:00.932 --> 17:02.064
Why-why are you taking them off?

17:02.108 --> 17:04.719
I just missed seeing your face
with my own eyes.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.329
Look, I know there's a lot

17:06.373 --> 17:08.331
of beautiful things
that I have not seen,

17:08.375 --> 17:10.855
but nothing in this world

17:10.899 --> 17:13.945
will make me
take my eyes off of you.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.426
Why are you so...
sweet to me?

17:16.470 --> 17:18.211
-[Winston chuckles]
-Mm.

17:18.254 --> 17:21.214
But we only have these for
a few more hours, and I want you

17:21.257 --> 17:23.738
to see as much as you can, babe.
All right, what's next?

17:23.781 --> 17:25.696
I want to see
some classic movies in color:

17:25.740 --> 17:27.655
Citizen Kane,
Schindler's List...

17:27.698 --> 17:30.353
Ooh, I got bad news for you.
[chuckles]

17:30.397 --> 17:32.486
This is a surprise.

17:32.529 --> 17:35.358
A real slobber goblin
tonight, huh?

17:35.402 --> 17:37.230
What are you talking about?

17:37.273 --> 17:39.797
-Cece?
-What?

17:51.331 --> 17:53.942
That terrier attacked
my sensitive area!

17:53.985 --> 17:56.249
Okay, how do you think I feel?
You confused me for a dog.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.772
I've never seen
a naked man before.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.469
Oh, what are
you guys doing here?

17:59.513 --> 18:01.254
-Who are these people?
-We're trying for another baby.

18:01.297 --> 18:04.735
Oh, my God. Congratulations!
We're adopting a dog!

18:04.779 --> 18:07.390
No, you're not. I've had enough.
I'm taking Mario.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.914
Wait! Don't take that dog.

18:09.958 --> 18:13.179
Jess deserves Mario.
This woman is amazing.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.789
She's gonna love that dog
so much

18:14.832 --> 18:17.139
that she's gonna pick up
its poop and keep it in bags.

18:50.477 --> 18:53.741
Oh, my God. You got him.

18:53.784 --> 18:56.396
That was heroic.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.658
I mean, it was so stupid,

18:57.701 --> 19:00.356
but it really... it was heroic.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.619
-Yeah.
-Mario.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.579
I am so mad at you,
but I love you.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.581
I mean, first you're
running away from us,

19:07.624 --> 19:09.322
now you're happy to see us.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.107
You are all over the map,
Mario Day-Miller.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.370
-[phone ringing]
-I got to grab that.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.330
Is that my dad?

19:17.373 --> 19:18.853
Yes, yeah, your dad...
He, uh...

19:18.896 --> 19:21.682
he calls me every time he...
he meets somebody from Chicago.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.553
I mean, he'll ask me, he'll go,

19:23.597 --> 19:25.425
"Do you know Tim from Chicago?
'Cause he doesn't know you."

19:25.468 --> 19:28.689
And then I just say "No,"
and then, yeah.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.431
That doesn't make any sense.
My dad doesn't even like you.

19:31.474 --> 19:34.782
-Well, that's what happens...
Whatever. Who cares? -Wait.

19:34.825 --> 19:38.307
Beso's where we went
on our first date.

19:38.351 --> 19:41.571
Did we? I'm restaurant blind.
I don't remember restaurants.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.921
Okay, now, we got to
get Mario back home

19:43.965 --> 19:45.488

she wants to take him back.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.447
Let's go! Let's go!

Nick, this dinner--

19:59.546 --> 20:01.417
were you gonna...?

20:01.461 --> 20:05.421
Jess, I had been planning this
for so long.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.817
I just wanted everything
to be perfect.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.819
But it is perfect.
I mean, it's us,

20:11.862 --> 20:14.300
so this is as perfect
as it gets.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.913
Okay.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.264
[gasps]
Is he about to...?

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

20:24.353 --> 20:25.746
All right.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.707
He's been keeping the engagement
ring in a plastic bag.

20:30.751 --> 20:34.450
It's not even a Ziploc bag.
It's just a generic plastic bag.

the rest of my life with you.

20:46.723 --> 20:49.509
I want to raise this dog
with you,

and eat good food and laugh

20:53.034 --> 20:54.905
and take care of each other.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.343
