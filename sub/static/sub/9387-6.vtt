WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:04.963
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.047 --> 00:08.091
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.175 --> 00:11.803
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.887 --> 00:14.932
On which we used to rely?

00:15.057 --> 00:18.185
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.310 --> 00:21.605
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.688 --> 00:23.148
All the things that make us

00:23.232 --> 00:24.900
Laugh and cry

00:24.983 --> 00:29.988
He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy!

00:34.284 --> 00:36.537
(over TV:)We now return
to Rodney King of Queens.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.455
Rodney, did you
take out the trash?

00:38.580 --> 00:40.666
Um, I forgot.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.125
(grunting)

00:42.292 --> 00:44.545
Oh, no she di-in't.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.171
(doorbell rings)

00:46.338 --> 00:47.881
Pizza for Adam West.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.718
No. You gave me Canadian bacon
instead of bacon?

00:51.844 --> 00:54.429
This misdeed cannot go
unpunished.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.683
Pizza delivery man,
prepare to meet your maker

00:57.808 --> 01:00.269
at the hands
of my cat launcher.

01:01.645 --> 01:02.896
(screaming)

01:04.690 --> 01:07.985
(cats yowling)

01:19.329 --> 01:20.789
Hey, look, somebody
tried to break

01:20.873 --> 01:22.833
into the dirty
movie store.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.586
Quick, grab as many as you can
before someone sees us.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.839
Damn, I lost him.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.716
All right, cats,
back in the bag.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.885
Come on, Fluffy.
Come on, Mittens.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.428
Come on, Paul.

01:34.511 --> 01:38.223
(laughing):
What a ridiculous name for a cat.

01:38.307 --> 01:41.685
Paul!
That's a person's name.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.896
A person's name.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.106
(laughing)

01:46.190 --> 01:47.733
Oh, Paul.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.738
Oh, man, this is
going to be great.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.072
Oh, are we watching
a movie?

01:54.198 --> 01:55.490
The lab results are back.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.993
You've tested positive
for nymphomania.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.995
Oh, no, what
should I do?

02:00.078 --> 02:02.456
Take two of these and
call us in the morning.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.790
(zippers whizzing)

02:03.916 --> 02:05.834
Oh, now that's not going
to help her nymphomania.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.045
It's only going
to exacerbate it.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.756
Oh, my God, what are
you kids doing?

02:10.839 --> 02:11.965
Out. Everybody out.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.217
(all groaning)

02:13.300 --> 02:14.551
STEWIE:
That's bogus.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.220
Chris, what is this?

02:16.345 --> 02:17.846
Genital Hospital.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.557
Yes, and it's inappropriate
for someone your age.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.059
Now, if you're curious
about sex,

02:22.142 --> 02:23.644
you should talk
to your sex ed teacher.

02:23.727 --> 02:24.895
We don't have one.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.564
The principal cut sex ed class
to save money.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.858
What? Well, that's crazy.

02:29.942 --> 02:33.445
Without sex ed, kids can
wind up sexually confused.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.155
Just look at
Michael Jackson.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.115
The kid in me likes
the frosted side...

02:37.282 --> 02:40.077
but the grown-up in me
likes the kid in me.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.703
Peter, do you know

02:41.787 --> 02:44.039
they're not teaching sex ed
at Chris' school?

02:44.122 --> 02:46.166
Eh, let them figure it
out the way I had to--

02:46.250 --> 02:48.085
with a can of Crisco
and a shot glass.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.670
That's the natural
way, Lois.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.088
That's the natural way.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.965
Well, somebody's got
to step in.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.967
Tomorrow, I'm going down
to James Woods High

02:55.050 --> 02:56.677
and offer to teach
the class myself.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.970
Hey, you could really
make a difference.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.847
Like I did when I taught
money management

02:59.930 --> 03:01.181
to those drug addicts.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.433
There's a lot of ways
for you guys to save money.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.185
For example, you're
all shooting up,

03:05.269 --> 03:06.395
why not share needles?

03:06.478 --> 03:07.771
That's a no-brainer.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.065
More money in your wallet,
more drugs in your veins.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.443
My second piece of advice:
have as many kids as you can,

03:13.569 --> 03:14.987
'cause that makes it
more likely

03:15.070 --> 03:18.866
that one of those kids'll grow
up and make it big in Hollywood.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.201
Then who's paying
the bills, eh?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.120
Hollywood kid.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.621
Class dismissed.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.626
Good morning, everyone.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.629
I'm Mrs. Griffin, your new
sex ed teacher.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.798
Now, you've probably heard
all those rumors

03:34.882 --> 03:37.134
that condoms make sex
less pleasurable.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.387
While that is a fact,
they also make sex safer.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.597
Sorry I'm late, Lois.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.140
Peter, what are
you doing here?

03:43.265 --> 03:45.267
Lois, do you think I'm going
to miss a chance to share

03:45.350 --> 03:47.144
my knowledge with these
fresh young minds?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.605
Forget it, I've missed
too many other opportunities.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.106
There he is.
Took you long enough.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.482
Just what we need.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.651
PETER'S VOICE:
Hey, guys, I'm coming in.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.111
(pieces groaning)

03:56.195 --> 03:57.988
Oh, God. Oh, boy.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.781
I am not going
to hear the end of this.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.200
You jackass.
Now you've done it.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.326
Idiot.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.660
I know I don't
fit here,

04:03.744 --> 04:05.329
but I'm just going
to settle right in.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.122
All right, Peter,
you can stay,

04:07.206 --> 04:09.041
but remember,
this is my class.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.168
Now, there are
a number of natural ways

04:11.251 --> 04:12.753
that males and females
interact, and...

04:12.836 --> 04:14.755
That's right--
allow me to demonstrate.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.381
Hey, Rainbow Brite.

04:16.465 --> 04:17.883
Hello, Shakespeare.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.636
I am all done writing
plays for the day,

04:20.719 --> 04:23.180
perhaps we could have
sexual intercourse?

04:23.388 --> 04:24.681
Count me in.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.898
I say, look at this.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.900
This toy has small parts.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.486
Why the devil would they
include small parts?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.780
Unless...
I'm supposed to eat them.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.406
Of course, it all adds up!

04:41.490 --> 04:42.699
Ow!

04:42.783 --> 04:45.118
Oh, dear God, I've lost a tooth.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.328
Dude, you're lucky.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.121
If you put that
under your pillow,

04:48.205 --> 04:50.249
the Tooth Fairy will come
and give you a dollar.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.168
What? Did you say
the Tooth Fairy comes here?

04:53.252 --> 04:54.253
To our house?

04:54.336 --> 04:56.296
She just breaks in
like some hood?

04:56.380 --> 04:58.006
Yeah, she creeps into
your house at night

04:58.090 --> 04:59.925
and comes into your
room while you sleep.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.093
Oh, my God!

05:01.176 --> 05:02.761
And sometimes, just
for the hell of it,

05:02.845 --> 05:04.930
she cuts off a piece
of her armpit hair

05:05.013 --> 05:07.140
and places it gently
on your tongue.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.976
Oh, oh, God! Oh, God,
I got to get out of here!

05:09.059 --> 05:10.978
I got to get out of here!
Stewie, calm down.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.104
Get a hold of yourself.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.647
Here, Brian, let
me handle this.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.732
Calm down. Everything's
going to be all right.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.068
Chris, you're wanted
on the phone.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.320
Everything's going
to be all right.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.239
(Stewie wailing)

05:28.161 --> 05:30.163
Hey, Lois, I wanted to
get some K-Y Jelly

05:30.247 --> 05:31.456
for the class today,

05:31.540 --> 05:33.333
but they were all out
so I got Smucker's.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.210
Peter, I don't know what
you think you're doing,

05:35.294 --> 05:36.837
but you ruined
my sex ed class.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.422
There's on way you're
coming with me again.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.966
Fine, but without my advice,
those kids are going to be

05:41.049 --> 05:42.342
as hopeless as Liam Neeson

05:42.426 --> 05:44.344
when he tries to play
an American cowboy.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.014
But, Montana,
when will you be back?

05:47.097 --> 05:48.557
(dryly): That's none of
your concern.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.726
You got to take care
of the offspring.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.103
Gonna take a fortnight at
least to get this herd down

05:53.187 --> 05:55.063
to St. Louis
on Mississippi.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.191
This glen's gonna be
tough to traverse,

05:57.274 --> 06:00.194
and that river's got to
be 50, 60 meters wide.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.362
And God knows
how many fathoms.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.198
To hell with
parliamentary procedure.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.116
We've got to wrangle
up some cattles.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.579
What is going on here?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.539
We're all protesting
the sex ed class

06:12.623 --> 06:13.957
that's being taught
to our children.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.043
Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this,

06:16.126 --> 06:19.379
but the school board has voted
to cancel your sex ed class.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.631
Look, Principal Shepherd,

06:20.714 --> 06:22.758
I know my husband
acted inappropriately...

06:22.841 --> 06:24.384
Oh, it's not because
of your husband.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.304
It's because you're teaching
those kids about condoms.

06:27.513 --> 06:28.514
What?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.390
That's ridiculous.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.435
These students have the right
to information about safe sex.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.896
Well, these parents
don't think so.

06:35.979 --> 06:36.980
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.357
You're fired.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.609
Fired?! Oh, no.

06:40.692 --> 06:44.279
(Knight Rider pre-commercial
theme playing)

06:48.408 --> 06:49.660
I can't believe
they fired you.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.869
Can't you go down
the school

06:50.953 --> 06:52.037
and try to reason
with them?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.248
No, I'm banned from
school property.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.542
The PTA doesn't want me
around their children.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.293
Well, Lois, I think
you did the right thing

06:58.377 --> 07:00.420
by trying to inform
these kids about safe sex.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.881
And if the parents don't
like it, that's their loss.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.383
That's the problem, though.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.760
It isn't their loss,
it's the kids' loss.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.304
I just hope they're getting
the information they need.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.058
All right, students, we have
a special speaker today

07:13.141 --> 07:14.935
who's going to educate you
about sex.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.771
Please welcome from
the First Evangelical Church,

07:17.938 --> 07:20.858
the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood
and the Opal Ring Crusade.

07:20.983 --> 07:24.111
Hey, kids, put your Walkmans
down and listen up.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.530
'Cause we're going to talk
about sex.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.116
(deep voice over speaker):
Sex? Hang on there, Jerry.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.493
God, what are you doing here?

07:31.577 --> 07:35.163
GOD:I was just passing through
on my way to see The Matrix.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.666
-(laughing): We can relate to that.
-No fake.

07:37.749 --> 07:41.211
Well, God, I am here
to talk to these kids about sex.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.713
GOD:
Uh-oh.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.840
And why they shouldn't
be having it.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.008
That is boss.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.385
Hey, you kids like Mad TV?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.762
Well, we've got something
almost as good.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.765
Here they are--
The Opal Ring Players.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.560
Boy, I sure had fun at the pizza parlor
tonight, Debbie.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.438
Yeah, Matthew, that
pizza pie was delicious.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.231
Hey, watch out,
crazy driver.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.400
That joker must have been
from Jefferson High.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.194
(laughing):
They're our rivals.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.988
Well, here we are
at the make-out point.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.948
Yeah. You want
to go all the way?

08:10.032 --> 08:11.033
Freeze!

08:11.116 --> 08:13.952
Now, who can tell me what
Matthew just did wrong?

08:14.036 --> 08:17.247
I mean, besides not running over
that yahoo from Jefferson High.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.041
(laughing):
They're our rivals.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.877
He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex
and he's not married.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.961
Bingo.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.421
Wow, you're pretty smart.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.006
Thanks. My name's Doug.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.090
I'm Meg.

08:27.299 --> 08:30.844
(romantic music swells)

08:31.929 --> 08:34.181
Now, look, let's rap
for a second.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.682
He's sitting informally
like us.

08:35.766 --> 08:36.934
Let's hear what he has to say.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.143
Jefferson High
is our rival.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.188
Sure, sex is fun,
but you can't have it

08:41.271 --> 08:44.066
before you're married,
even if you use a condom.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.319
Because not only to condoms fail
100% of the time,

08:47.402 --> 08:49.571
they're also majorly unsafe.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.490
Hey, you wouldn't put
a plastic bag

08:51.573 --> 08:53.408
over your grandmother's head,
would you?

08:53.492 --> 08:54.535
ALL:
No.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.827
And that's why we're gonna be

08:55.911 --> 08:57.579
handing out these opal rings.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.415
These rings are a symbol of your
commitment to refrain from sex

09:00.499 --> 09:02.000
until you're married.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.085
So what do you say?

09:03.168 --> 09:04.169
Who wants to be joyful?

09:04.253 --> 09:05.504
Who wants to be pure?

09:05.671 --> 09:08.048
Who wants to be... abstinent?

09:08.131 --> 09:10.175
(cheering)

09:10.259 --> 09:12.261
Wow, he makes
so much sense.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.304
I know, he's a visionary,

09:14.429 --> 09:17.015
like Gandhi or Mozart
or Picasso.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.601
Ladies and gentlemen,
my newest work.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.270
Now, I know this person
looks a little mixed up,

09:21.353 --> 09:22.646
but, watch carefully.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.316
If I move this down here,
and this over here

09:26.400 --> 09:30.237
and this part here...
anyone tell who it is yet?

09:30.320 --> 09:35.075
No? Okay, well, what if I move
this here and this here...

09:35.158 --> 09:36.702
Then it's Dianne Wiest.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.373
All right, men,
your mission tonight

09:41.456 --> 09:43.917
is to stave off the invading
forces of the Tooth Fairy.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.627
SpongeBob, you watch the East.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.504
StarScream, you take the West.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.631
And Man-E-Faces,
you take center patrol

09:49.715 --> 09:51.341
since you have many faces.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.472
(gasps)

09:57.556 --> 09:58.557
(screaming)

09:58.640 --> 09:59.725
Hey, hey, hey,
it's okay.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.185
It's morning.
Is it?

10:01.310 --> 10:02.394
Ha! I knew it!

10:02.477 --> 10:03.520
I scared her off.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.814
Uh, you might want to check
under your pillow.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.107
(Stewie gasps)

10:07.191 --> 10:08.192
How did she get in?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.276
She must have been quieter

10:09.359 --> 10:10.986
than Britney Spears'
dietician.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.989
(wimpish): Ea-Easy
on those trans fats.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.242
N-Not everything
needs gravy.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.496
You know, there's some carrots
down at the other end.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.918
That-that cheesecake
was for everyone.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.961
Her hand was right
beneath my pillow.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.922
She could have snapped my
neck if she had a mind to.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.006
Don't worry about it.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.008
I'm sure it will be a while
before you lose another tooth.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.092
I can't wait for that.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.136
I have to lure her back
on my terms

10:36.220 --> 10:37.554
and kill her myself!

10:37.638 --> 10:41.225
But to catch a fairy,
I have to think like a fairy.

10:41.517 --> 10:42.976
ANNOUNCER:
If you want Brian to say,

10:43.060 --> 10:46.647
Well, that'll be a stretch"
text-message FAMGUY1.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.023
If you want Brian to say,

10:48.106 --> 10:51.568
"I'm not touching that one,"
text FAMGUY2.

10:51.652 --> 10:52.986
If you want Brian to say,

10:53.070 --> 10:57.157
"Arriba!" and dance around
a sombrero, text FAMGUY3.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.408
Enter now.

10:58.492 --> 11:01.411
(soft music playing)

11:01.495 --> 11:02.621
Thanks for voting.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.623
Arriba!

11:04.706 --> 11:08.001
(Latin music playing)

11:08.085 --> 11:10.170
(over TV):
We now return to Laguna Beach.

11:10.254 --> 11:11.839
Like, right?
I know.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.715
Whatever, because-- duh!
I know, right?

11:13.799 --> 11:16.176
Whatever, because I mean,
like, totally full out.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.636
Full on.
Right?

11:17.719 --> 11:20.097
I guess it's not easy
growing up anywhere.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.307
Hey, Dad, check out
my abstinence ring.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.268
It means I made a
pledge not to have sex.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.103
That's crazy!
You can't give up sex.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.604
You've got a responsibility.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.440
You see, Meg, you're what
they call a "practice girl."

11:30.566 --> 11:32.860
Dad, look at the
facts about sex.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.946
"If you have sex,
your penis will fall off

11:36.029 --> 11:39.533
"and land in another dimension
populated entirely by dogs

11:39.616 --> 11:40.993
who will eat it."

11:41.076 --> 11:42.953
Well, that's something
I'd like to avoid.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.371
Well, this changes everything.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.832
From now on,
I, too, will be obstinate.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.458
Abstinent.
Absinthe.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.877
Abstinent.
You're grounded.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.381
All right, getting a tooth
to lure that damn fairy back

11:54.464 --> 11:56.008
shouldn't be too difficult.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.260
(snoring)

12:06.560 --> 12:10.814
I'd love to dance,
Fred Savage. Mm...

12:15.485 --> 12:17.321
Gosh, Meg,
I really wish

12:17.404 --> 12:18.989
we could take our relationship
to the next level.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.908
I know, I feel
the same way,

12:20.991 --> 12:23.118
but we made a decision
to be abstinent.

12:23.202 --> 12:26.622
Of course, there are ways
we could keep our pledge

12:26.705 --> 12:28.749
and still do
other things.

12:28.832 --> 12:29.833
You're right.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.710
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.003
Uh-huh.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.172
Oh, there it is.
I see it.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.256
You know, Roy,

12:36.340 --> 12:38.383
I hope you play squash
better than you pass.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.177
Well, we'll find out
this Saturday.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.678
(both laugh)

12:44.932 --> 12:46.183
LOIS:
All right, Peter,

12:46.266 --> 12:48.060
you ready for
role-playing night?

12:48.143 --> 12:50.187
Here comes, Grimace,

12:50.270 --> 12:52.648
You got some burgers
I can steal, huh?

12:52.773 --> 12:54.983
Lois, the Hamburglar
steals hamburgers.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.361
Grimace is Ronald McDonald's
autistic friend.

12:57.444 --> 13:01.323
Oh, come on, you love the
dirty-talking Grimace.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.575
You... Peter, what
the hell is this?

13:03.659 --> 13:04.868
My chastity belt.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.370
A chastity belt?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.038
What in God's name
is that for?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.498
I'm abstinent, Lois.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.667
It's all in these pamphlets
Meg brought home from school.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.503
Sex turns straight people gay
and turn gays into Mexicans.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.754
Everyone goes down
a notch.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.464
(scoffs)
This is nonsense.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.383
You can't force
abstinence on kids.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.094
Lois, what possible
harm can abstinence do?

13:22.219 --> 13:23.929
Meg Griffin,
we need to have a talk.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.055
(gasps)

13:25.138 --> 13:26.348
Mom!

13:26.682 --> 13:29.309
Oh, my God!

13:29.476 --> 13:32.521
You kids were doing it...
in the ear!

13:32.646 --> 13:33.772
Hey, my sandwich
tastes funny.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.274
Is there something
wrong with the Smucker's?

13:35.357 --> 13:36.900
PETER:
Yeah, it's been on my crotch.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.906
Meg, I still cannot believe

13:42.990 --> 13:44.616
what you and Doug did
last night.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.201
Mom, you don't understand.

13:46.285 --> 13:47.786
Doug and I are abstinent,

13:47.870 --> 13:50.247
but if we have sex in the ear,
it doesn't count.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.708
We're still pure
in the eyes of the Lord.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.086
Meg, when I was your age,
my parents tried to feed me

13:56.170 --> 13:58.380
the same nonsense
about premarital sex.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.756
You're lying to yourself.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.216
Well, I don't care
what you think!

14:01.341 --> 14:03.594
Doug and I are part of
the Opal Ring Crusade,

14:03.677 --> 14:05.637
and this is how we choose
to express our love.

14:05.721 --> 14:09.057
Look, Meg, A:
ear sex is just unnatural,

14:09.141 --> 14:11.560
and B...
how do I say this?

14:11.643 --> 14:16.940
Vaginal intercourse is...
it's just tops.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.193
It's the bee's knees, Meg.

14:19.276 --> 14:23.822
Oh, when you rattle it around
just right-- oh, my God!

14:23.906 --> 14:26.867
I mean, you remember when we had
that old car with the bad shocks

14:26.992 --> 14:29.578
and I used to take
the old dirt road on purpose?

14:29.661 --> 14:31.622
Meg... Meg?

14:32.497 --> 14:33.624
I love you.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.213
In local news,
a sexy new trend

14:39.296 --> 14:41.048
has emerged
at James Woods High.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.132
That's right, Tom.

14:42.216 --> 14:44.927
It appears that students
have taken to having ear sex

14:45.010 --> 14:46.720
in lieu of traditional
intercourse.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.890
Over 200 reports of ear sex
have been confirmed so far,

14:49.973 --> 14:51.350
prompting a new slogan:

14:51.433 --> 14:53.769
"Once you go black,
you go deaf."

14:54.061 --> 14:55.354
Brian,
I'll be right back.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.939
I'm going to use
the little girl's room.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.023
All right, baby.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.152
(groans) An entire week
and still no teeth.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.695
And it turns out
these teeth I got

15:03.779 --> 15:05.405
from the old man
are phony.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.908
Brian, Brian, look,
I'm Gary Busey.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.660
I'm frequently aggressive

15:09.743 --> 15:11.870
in situations
that don't call for it.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.580
(girl vomiting)

15:13.872 --> 15:14.873
What the hell is that?

15:14.957 --> 15:15.999
Ah, it's Jillian.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.794
She's, uh... she has
this eating disorder.

15:18.877 --> 15:19.878
She's bulimic.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.296
My God, that's horrible!

15:21.380 --> 15:22.381
I know, it really is.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.091
I mean, her hair
is falling out.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.634
Last week she
lost a tooth.

15:25.717 --> 15:26.718
Really?

15:26.802 --> 15:28.345
But man, I'll tell ya,
all that purging

15:28.428 --> 15:31.265
just makes her body
look fantastic.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.308
I mean, that's what
the supermodels do.

15:33.392 --> 15:36.353
And so many of them
just look so great.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.105
(vomiting continues)

15:38.605 --> 15:39.898
Karen Carpenter
overdid it,

15:39.982 --> 15:42.067
but I think Jillian's
found a good balance.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.823
I'm really surprised you invited me out
for dinner, Stevie.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.950
Oh, well, you know,
I just wanted to touch base,

15:50.033 --> 15:51.618
see how everything's...
It's "Stewie," by the way.

15:51.702 --> 15:53.787
Just to check in, make sure
everything's going well

15:53.871 --> 15:55.080
with you and Brian.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.665
It's going kickass!

15:56.748 --> 15:58.500
Well, you look
fantastic.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.711
Got some meat on your bones,
which is great.

16:00.794 --> 16:01.795
What?

16:01.879 --> 16:02.880
Just saying
you look jolly,

16:02.963 --> 16:05.924
like Ruben Studdard
or John Goodman or Santa.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.760
Oh, my God. Are
you saying I'm fat?

16:08.844 --> 16:10.053
No, I'm saying
Santa's thin.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.597
-Get in there and throw up!
-(gasps)

16:13.265 --> 16:16.059
Excellent. Now I'm prepared
to fight the Tooth Fairy

16:16.143 --> 16:19.354
just like Gerri fought comedy
on The Facts of Life.

16:19.438 --> 16:21.398
Hey, Blair, did you find
a purse at the mall?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.275
Actually, I
found seven.

16:23.442 --> 16:24.776
(audience laughs)

16:24.860 --> 16:27.279
One for every day
of the week.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.239
(audience groans)

16:32.618 --> 16:34.786
I'm wide awake, Peter.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.288
You want to
mess around?

16:36.371 --> 16:38.165
Lois, you know
I'm abstinent.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.291
(scoffs)
Come on.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.919
Can't you break your stupid
pledge for one night?

16:42.002 --> 16:44.630
Well, I guess we
do both have needs.

16:44.713 --> 16:45.964
(both cooing)

16:46.048 --> 16:47.633
Oh, Peter.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.052
(Lois laughs)

16:50.135 --> 16:51.261
Wh-What are you doing?

16:51.345 --> 16:53.055
What? Peter, what are
you doing to my ear?!

16:53.138 --> 16:54.306
Get off of me!

16:54.389 --> 16:56.350
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

16:56.433 --> 16:58.393
This is all I can do,
Lois; I'm abstinent.

16:58.477 --> 16:59.520
That is it.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.355
I am going to have
regular sex with you

17:01.438 --> 17:03.190
whether you like it or not.
No!

17:03.273 --> 17:05.734
I wasn't asking
your permission.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.155
No, no, no!
I'm abstinent!

17:10.239 --> 17:11.823
This is an affront
to the Lord!

17:11.907 --> 17:13.575
No! No!

17:13.659 --> 17:16.161
(weeping)

17:16.286 --> 17:18.747
No!

17:18.830 --> 17:20.624
Oh, I see what
you're driving at.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.628
Oh, that was fantastic.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.797
Hey, when'd you get that tattoo
on your lower back?

17:26.880 --> 17:27.881
I don't know, Peter.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.341
-Meth is a hell of a drug.
-What?

17:29.424 --> 17:31.593
I'm just glad to have
you back on my side.

17:31.677 --> 17:34.680
I only wish I could convince Meg and her
classmates, too.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.181
We'll show 'em somehow, Lois.

17:36.265 --> 17:38.016
I'll be more convincing
than Mel Gibson

17:38.100 --> 17:39.768
when he apologized to the Jews.

17:39.852 --> 17:43.355
I'm really, really sorry
about your big noses.

17:43.564 --> 17:46.400
I'm really sorry
about how greedy you are.

17:46.650 --> 17:49.194
But most of all,
I'm really sorry

17:49.278 --> 17:52.531
about your dirty, underhanded,
backstabbing ways.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.784
Your number-one dirty Jew fan,
Mel Gibson.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.080
(low humming)

18:00.163 --> 18:03.917
All right, Tooth Whore,
do your worst.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.461
(alarm ringing)
Aha!

18:06.962 --> 18:08.797
Stewie, what the hell?
Get me down from here.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.299
No, way, man! How
do I know you're

18:10.382 --> 18:11.633
not the Tooth Fairy
in disguise?

18:11.717 --> 18:13.177
Your middle name
is Gilligan. Not good enough!

18:13.260 --> 18:14.511
You think my girlfriend's
a moron.

18:14.595 --> 18:15.637
So does everyone!

18:15.721 --> 18:17.264
You have a picture
of Chris Noth in your wallet.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.348
Okay.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.267
Stewie, this is ridiculous.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.810
There's something
I have to tell you.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.812
The Tooth Fairy
isn't real.

18:23.896 --> 18:24.897
What?!

18:24.980 --> 18:26.398
Look, I didn't want
to burst your bubble

18:26.481 --> 18:27.816
since you're just a kid,

18:27.941 --> 18:29.693
but, yeah, she's all smoke
and mirrors

18:29.818 --> 18:31.111
just like Harry Houdini.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.404
But I don't want
to play bridge

18:32.487 --> 18:33.822
with the Petersons
tonight.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.366
Harry, we agreed weeks ago,
and we're going.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.493
All right, fine,
let me get my coat.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.955
Oh, wait a second!

18:42.164 --> 18:45.209
Damn it! I am not going
by myself!

18:45.417 --> 18:46.585
Ah, you bitch.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.128
Oh, very well then.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.172
I suppose that bile-
spewing skirt of yours

18:50.255 --> 18:51.840
can have her tooth back.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.678
What? It's gone!

18:56.803 --> 18:58.680
Whoa, I wonder
what happened to it?

19:04.728 --> 19:06.605
(sniffing)

19:07.439 --> 19:09.691
Ah...

19:10.192 --> 19:11.902
(bleep) yeah!

19:16.448 --> 19:18.700
Peter, how are we going
to get past the guard?

19:18.784 --> 19:22.287
Lois, I think I
just got an idea.

19:24.373 --> 19:25.749
You see that guy
with the overcoat?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.668
He's tall enough for us to sneak
in behind him.

19:27.751 --> 19:28.752
Come on!

19:28.836 --> 19:32.339
So remember, sex is bad,
immoral, and wrong.

19:32.464 --> 19:33.882
And if you have sex,

19:33.966 --> 19:36.009
you're automatically
in Al Qaeda.

19:36.093 --> 19:38.470
Kids, do not listen to this man.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.348
He is wrong--
he is feeding you lies.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.808
Now, look, it's true.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.686
You shouldn't have sex
until you're ready.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.896
You should wait
until you're in love.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.899
But I mean, hey,
we're all human, huh?

19:50.983 --> 19:54.403
We have urges,
and they are perfectly natural.

19:54.695 --> 19:57.447
And if you do make the choice
to act on them,

19:57.531 --> 20:00.033
make sure you protect
yourselves,

20:00.325 --> 20:01.660
use a condom.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.329
I'm going to
use condoms.

20:04.413 --> 20:05.414
Me, too!

20:05.539 --> 20:07.332
Maybe I'll use two
condoms at the same time.

20:07.416 --> 20:08.542
Why would you do that?

20:08.625 --> 20:09.918
Oh, I mean, just
one, just one.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.753
Doug, my mom's right.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.881
If we really care
about each other,

20:13.964 --> 20:15.257
it's okay to have sex.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.425
We'll be safe.

20:16.508 --> 20:19.469
We'll use a condom,
and it'll be wonderful.

20:19.553 --> 20:21.805
Wow! Does this mean
I'll see you naked?

20:21.889 --> 20:22.890
Yeah.

20:22.973 --> 20:24.183
Oh, boy, I can't wait.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.393
I'm sorry Doug
dumped you, honey.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.478
It's all your fault!

20:29.771 --> 20:31.190
I'm proud of you,
sweetheart.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.316
Me, too, Lois.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.525
You stood up
for what you believe in.

20:33.609 --> 20:34.610
I just wish
I could have been there

20:34.693 --> 20:36.111
to hear the speech you made.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.696
You think you could
give me a little taste?

20:37.779 --> 20:41.408

speech, text-message FAMGUY1.
