WEBVTT

00:02.306 --> 00:03.655
Scrambled eggs
with English muffin

00:03.742 --> 00:05.483
and cottage cheese
with one sliced peach.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.224
No, man, the cottage
cheese is mine.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.704
Oh, my bad.

00:08.791 --> 00:10.706
I was confused because
he's usually the one

00:10.793 --> 00:14.492
who gets the plate
of fat man baby food.

00:14.579 --> 00:15.972
But I guess,
no matter who orders it

00:16.059 --> 00:17.408
I'm the one
that takes crap for it.

00:17.495 --> 00:20.629
That appears to be the case.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.152
Can you please
just order pancakes

00:22.239 --> 00:23.153
so I don't have
to go through this?

00:23.240 --> 00:24.807
Can't, I want to keep it light

00:24.894 --> 00:26.200
'cause Christina's makin'
a special dinner for me.

00:27.592 --> 00:30.421
Oh...oh, man,
how do you eat this stuff?

00:30.508 --> 00:33.381
It's not really milk,
it's not really cheese.

00:33.468 --> 00:36.601
It's like sour cream
and oatmeal had an ugly baby.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.603
Just pretend it's something
else, that's what I do.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.475
Right now, I'm pretendin'
these plain scrambled eggs

00:40.562 --> 00:42.259
are a delightful Denver omelet.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.957
This dive we're sittin' in
is a quaint New Orleans bistro

00:45.045 --> 00:47.438
and I'm Turner
and you're Hooch.

00:47.525 --> 00:48.700
Really?

00:48.787 --> 00:50.137
See, I always
go to "Lethal Weapon."

00:50.224 --> 00:51.486
I'm Danny Glover
and you're Mel Gibson

00:51.573 --> 00:54.228
with a thyroid condition.

00:54.315 --> 00:57.753
Just eat your curds.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.494
Well, sounds like things
are going pretty good

00:59.581 --> 01:00.538
with you and Christina.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.192
I am truly smitten.

01:02.279 --> 01:03.976
I mean when she talks,
I'm actually listenin' to her

01:04.064 --> 01:05.456
and not just noddin'
my head and imaginin'

01:05.543 --> 01:07.415
what she looks like naked
on a see-saw.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.332
So, is there
a chance that tonight

01:11.419 --> 01:13.116
there's gonna be more
than food on the menu?

01:13.203 --> 01:15.553
The sexual aspect
of our relationship is moot

01:15.640 --> 01:17.947
'cause we've already connected
on a soulful, spiritual level.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.514
And that's why you got
a clean pair of undies

01:19.601 --> 01:22.560
and a toothbrush
in your glove box.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.432
As well as a three-pack of
flavored love jellies

01:24.519 --> 01:25.607
and a strip of condoms
long enough

01:25.694 --> 01:27.652
to choke a World War II
machine gun.

You can paint and pluck
in the back of the RV.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.427
I thought you were gettin'
a room at the casino.

02:03.514 --> 02:06.300
Not just a room, my friend,
the presidential suite.

02:06.387 --> 02:09.955
That's three beds, a wet bar,
and two and a half crappers.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.698
Then why you rentin'
the mobile home?

02:13.785 --> 02:16.440
Well, the casino is right on
the Illinois-Indiana border

02:16.527 --> 02:19.051
and I have some business
that requires wheels

am I talkin' to Mike the cop

02:30.715 --> 02:34.197
or Mike, the lovable lump
who can keep a secret?

02:34.284 --> 02:35.764

How are you not a detective?

02:48.559 --> 02:51.823
Well, the written test
really thins the herd.

02:51.910 --> 02:55.262
I got a connection who gets 'em
directly from Shanghai.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.702
I knew he'd know.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.705
And we were doing
a little kissin'

10:18.792 --> 10:20.707
on the couch,
and it was hot.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.274
You know, like when you just
become one big tongue?

10:23.361 --> 10:25.276
Yeah, yeah, I get the gist.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.365
Don't look at me,
you're the one that let him in.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.892
And then she said, "Why don't we
take this into the bedroom?"

10:31.979 --> 10:33.371
And the next thing I know

10:33.458 --> 10:35.939
I was drivin' in my car
to a liquor store

10:36.026 --> 10:38.986
and sittin' outside
of your house gettin' drunk.

10:39.073 --> 10:41.336
Well, you're done driving
for the night.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.816
Make up the couch for him.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.426
I'm gonna put on a pot of coffee

10:44.513 --> 10:46.428
and call Christina
and tell her you're not dead.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.690
Don't tell her that yet.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.519
Oh, don't be that way!

10:50.606 --> 10:53.217
I love you, man.

10:53.304 --> 10:56.046
Whoa, is this silk?

10:56.133 --> 10:58.788
You're like a king-size
waterbed in a fancy hotel.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.879
I will never forgive
you for this.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.794
[instrumental music]

11:08.189 --> 11:08.972
[instrumental music]

11:12.280 --> 11:14.543
Remind me, I got your silk
pajama top in my locker.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.197
And you'll be happy to
know grandma was able

11:16.284 --> 11:18.199
to get all my
vomit out of it.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.201
You know what?
Why don't you keep it?

11:20.288 --> 11:22.072
Oh, great, now I'm stuck
with a silk car cover

11:22.159 --> 11:24.727
with a puke stain on it.

11:24.814 --> 11:25.728
[cell phone ringing]

11:31.168 --> 11:33.040
How come you're not taking
Christina's calls?

11:33.127 --> 11:35.520
I can't just drop everything
to talk to her. We're on duty.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.088
I see, but you took 20 minutes
to call into Sports Talk

11:38.175 --> 11:39.960
to bitch about the Bears'
throwback uniforms.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.613
Hey, those jerseys
are old timey ugly

11:41.701 --> 11:42.963
and they make
a mockery of the sport.

11:43.050 --> 11:46.140
You made that very clear,
Bob from Waukegan.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.445
So, what's going on?

11:47.532 --> 11:49.186
You never gonna talk
to her again?

11:49.273 --> 11:51.275
Just stay out of it, okay?
It's none of your business.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.147
Hey, when you prevent me
from having sex

11:53.234 --> 11:55.889
with my girlfriend,
it becomes my business.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.499
Now, if you're interested,
I have a little theory

11:57.586 --> 11:58.805
about why you
couldn't close the deal.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.241
I don't wanna hear your theory.

12:00.328 --> 12:03.723
Good, makes it more fun for me.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.290
Now, your usual
go-to girl typically has

12:06.377 --> 12:07.988
fake boobs,
a fake name and pimp.

12:08.075 --> 12:11.469
- Now, just make your point.
- In a moment.

12:11.556 --> 12:14.516
Then along comes a strong,
beautiful woman like Christina.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.126
She's foreign to you.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.433
You get little intimidated,
and bing, bang, boom.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.566
You can't bing, bang, boom.

12:21.653 --> 12:22.698
Excuse me?

12:22.785 --> 12:24.395
Well, that had
to be humiliating

12:24.482 --> 12:26.310
especially for
a big blowhard like you.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.269
Hey, she was willin'
and I was able.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.880
As able as a guy can be when
he's shootin' pool with a rope.

12:33.622 --> 12:37.452
- I am done talkin' to you.
- Oh, don't be that way.

12:37.539 --> 12:40.542
Just tryin' to get
a rise out of you.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.631
You get it?

12:44.328 --> 12:46.069
[instrumental music]

12:48.898 --> 12:53.033
You know, I hear those little
blue pills really work wonders.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.209
Hey, I can get
an erection right now

12:55.296 --> 12:57.994
that you could do chin-ups on.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.822
Not you, but a guy
who could actually do a chin up.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.433
Ah..

13:02.520 --> 13:04.827
- Carl?
- Christina.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.655
[Mike]
Hey, Christina.

13:06.742 --> 13:07.743
I'm gonna order lunch.
Can I get you anything?

13:07.830 --> 13:09.223
Get him a spine.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.747
It appears he was
born without one.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.009
One spine comin' up.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.055
I'm gonna have a grilled cheese.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.060
- So, listen--
- No, you listen.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.626
You run out of my house
with no explanation

13:21.713 --> 13:23.367
and then don't return my calls.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.891
- What kind of man are you?
- I was gonna call you.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.370
- I've just been a little busy.
- Oh, really?

13:26.457 --> 13:28.764
And when you called
what were you gonna tell me?

13:28.851 --> 13:30.113
That's why I haven't called yet.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.421
I'm just a little blurry
on the wording.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.466
Yeah, well, I'm not.

13:35.553 --> 13:38.121
You and me, are done.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.959
This is tragic.
Poor Carl.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.222
Yeah, it's too bad.
She was a good one.

13:52.309 --> 13:55.008
Yes, she was.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.923
So how long should I wait
before askin' her out?

14:05.018 --> 14:07.542
Carlton, what are
you doin' home?

14:07.629 --> 14:08.630
Just hangin' out,
watchin' some football.

14:08.717 --> 14:09.936
No, you ain't.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.589
Brother Heywood's
on his way over here

14:11.676 --> 14:13.765
with a deck of cards
and a bottle of Tawny port.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.682
Don't worry, I won't interfere
with your card game.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.771
Ain't nobody
playing cards, fool.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.471
That's why I need
your narrow butt

14:23.558 --> 14:25.473
off the couch
and out of my house.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.562
I'll just go to my room
and put my headphones on.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.912
Brother Heywood's been out
of town for six weeks.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.741
You need to go to the garage
and turn on the leaf blower.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.746
Why don't you go spend
some time with Christina?

14:39.748 --> 14:41.837
I don't think that's
an option anymore, grandma.

14:41.924 --> 14:45.101
Oh, no, what kind of nasty,
freaky perversion

14:45.188 --> 14:47.756
you try and talk that sweet,
innocent girl into?

14:47.843 --> 14:49.540
It's not about that.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.151
She wanted me to spend the night
with her, but I couldn't do it.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.283
I told you if you kept
playin' with yourself

14:53.370 --> 14:56.634
you wouldn't be able
to play with others.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.375
Hey, my equipment is fine.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.769
It's just, I don't
need to be gettin' involved

15:00.856 --> 15:02.249
with some woman
who's already got a kid.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.642
Why? 'Cause you think
you can do better than her?

15:04.729 --> 15:06.340
No, because I think
she can do better than me.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.821
Oh, baby, of course she can.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.475
But if she ain't
sayin' it out loud

15:11.562 --> 15:15.262
don't you be
puttin' it in her head.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.090
I mean, what do I know about
being somebody's daddy?

15:17.177 --> 15:18.352
I mean,
I never knew my own father

15:18.439 --> 15:19.875
and I barely remember my mom.

15:19.962 --> 15:23.313
Hold on, is she askin' you
to be this boy's daddy?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.749
No, but..

15:26.447 --> 15:27.752
Stop thinkin'.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.016
You ain't good at it,
so don't even try.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.193
But if..

15:35.021 --> 15:36.848
What did I just say to you?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.720
Grandma, the woman's got
plenty to deal with.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.375
Raising a six-year-old son
without me complicatin' things.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.768
Well, I sure know
what that's like.

15:43.855 --> 15:46.858
You were about that age when
you came here to live with me.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.166
Lord, you were a sullen,
moody child.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.559
The only time
you ever smiled was

15:51.646 --> 15:53.865
on those rare occasions
when your mama called.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.432
I don't recollect any of that.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.565
Well, ain't for lack of memory,
because, shoot..

15:57.652 --> 15:59.523
you used to be able
to recite every episode

15:59.610 --> 16:01.525
of "Dukes Of Hazzard"
and Dr. King's

16:01.612 --> 16:04.267
"I Have A Dream" speech.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.616
Oh, yeah,
I remember doing that.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.184
I loved seein' you
emulate the good doctor.

16:08.271 --> 16:11.057
But that other mess was
just hillbilly gibberish.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.976
Maybe some things are less
painful to remember.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.890
I suppose so.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.155
But I sure am thankful
for the way things played out.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.244
'Cause if you hadn't
come here to live with me

16:24.331 --> 16:26.202
I'd have missed
out on some of my..

16:29.901 --> 16:31.903
...my most precious memories.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.256
Thank you, grandma.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.608
Now, as much as I love

16:40.695 --> 16:42.610
havin' you in my life..

16:42.697 --> 16:44.960
...I need you to get out
of my house.

16:47.528 --> 16:48.485
Right.

16:50.139 --> 16:53.099
"Five score years ago,
a great American

16:53.186 --> 16:55.797
"in whose symbolic shadow
we stand today

16:55.884 --> 16:58.060
signed the emancipation
proclamation."

16:58.147 --> 17:01.107
Time and place, boy,
time and place.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.587
- Goodnight, grandma.
- 'Mm-hmm.'

17:03.674 --> 17:05.546
[instrumental music]

17:11.682 --> 17:13.597
[knocks on door]

17:18.211 --> 17:19.473
What are you doing here, Carl?

17:19.560 --> 17:21.170
Look, I understand
if you don't wanna talk

17:21.257 --> 17:22.650
but I need a chance
to explain myself.

17:22.737 --> 17:25.435
- Not interested.
- Please, just give me a minute.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.746
You got one minute.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.617
Ok, first of all,
I'm sorry I ran off.

17:33.704 --> 17:35.054
That was a stupid thing to do.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.404
No me answering
this door was stupid.

17:37.491 --> 17:40.494
What you did was selfish,
inconsiderate and cowardly.

17:40.581 --> 17:41.930
No argument.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.410
Quick question,
when you talk

17:43.497 --> 17:46.413
is that time
taken out of my minute?

17:46.500 --> 17:49.024
Thirty seconds.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.070
When I was six years old
my mom ran off and left me

17:51.157 --> 17:53.028
with my grandma which may have
caused abandonment issues

17:53.115 --> 17:54.682
which have not been
dealt with properly

17:54.769 --> 17:56.640
at all really and then
when I saw you singin'

17:56.727 --> 17:58.990
to your little boy,
like an angel, might I add

17:59.078 --> 18:00.731
it brought up those
aforementioned issues

18:00.818 --> 18:03.082
and I'm afraid I reacted poorly.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.824
You still got five seconds.

18:06.911 --> 18:10.524
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.961
So, you're telling me
a 35-year-old man

18:13.048 --> 18:16.530
never been married, lives
with his grandma, has issues?

18:16.617 --> 18:17.879
You see right
through me, don't you?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.750
From day one.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.752
And I still stuck around.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.972
So you're clearly
not the only one

18:24.059 --> 18:26.931
on this porch with problems.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.977
You know, problems
have been known to go away

18:29.064 --> 18:30.979
over a glass of wine.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.416
Yeah, I've heard that.

18:33.503 --> 18:37.116
But my son's here now,
so I can't ask you in.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.770
I understand.
Maybe some other time?

18:39.857 --> 18:42.469
Maybe, I already gone
a year a half

18:42.556 --> 18:44.688
so I'm in no rush.

18:44.775 --> 18:47.430
A year and a half? Damn.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.997
Damn is right.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.477
You'd still be trying
to put your eyeballs

18:50.564 --> 18:52.131
back in your head.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.873
Well, you're killin' me, girl.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.397
That's the idea.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.191
[instrumental music]

19:26.208 --> 19:27.905
Alright, we got about
three more hours

19:27.992 --> 19:29.385
before they come back
from Indiana.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.779
God willing.

19:31.866 --> 19:35.043
Should we start here,
work our way up

19:35.130 --> 19:36.523
or start upstairs
and work our way down?

19:36.610 --> 19:41.049
Ooh! We could do it in
my sister's beanbag chair.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.746
No, it makes weird
enough noises when

19:42.833 --> 19:46.315
you sit on it
wearin' pants.

19:46.402 --> 19:49.275
Got a crazy idea.
How about our bed?

19:49.362 --> 19:52.060
- You're a dirty girl.
- Hey..

19:52.147 --> 19:53.366
[doorbell rings]

19:53.453 --> 19:57.848
Oh! Are you kidding?

19:57.935 --> 19:59.546
I know you were worried,
so I wanted to come by

19:59.633 --> 20:01.504
and tell you everything
is fine and we talked..

20:03.854 --> 20:05.334
'Should I wait out here
till you're done?'

20:05.421 --> 20:07.293
- No!
- No!
