03:49.950 --> 03:52.750
Somebody's pullin' me close to the ground.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.450
I can sense, but I can't see.

03:58.050 --> 04:00.850
I ain't panicked. I been here before.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.950
Same as when I got popped
on 104th Street.

04:05.350 --> 04:07.949
Don't take me to no hospital, please.

04:08.049 --> 04:10.749
Fuckin' emergency rooms
don't save nobody.

04:11.149 --> 04:13.549
Son of a bitches always pop you
at midnight...

04:13.749 --> 04:17.249
...when all they got is a Chinese intern
with a dull spoon.

04:18.449 --> 04:23.149
Look at these suckers scramblin' around.
What for?

04:23.849 --> 04:27.449
My Puerto Rican ass ain't supposed
to have made it this far.

04:28.149 --> 04:31.249
Most of my crew got washed
a long time ago.

04:36.349 --> 04:40.648
Don't worry. My heart, it don't ever quit.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.048
I ain't ready to check out.

04:54.148 --> 04:56.748
Seems like I just got out of the joint.

04:57.148 --> 05:01.148
Stood up in front of that judge,
and told him what was who.

05:04.148 --> 05:07.448
Now I ain't sayin' that my way
would have been different...

05:07.548 --> 05:11.947
...had my mother been alive when I was
a kid, 'cause that's all you hear in the joint.

05:12.047 --> 05:15.947
"I didn't have a chance." No. Bullshit.

05:16.347 --> 05:21.447
I was already a mean little bastard
while my mother was alive, and I know it.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.347
But I learned about women from her.

05:23.447 --> 05:27.247
Mr. Brigante, there are 56 cases
on the court's docket for this morning.

05:27.347 --> 05:28.847
Why am I listening to this?

05:28.947 --> 05:31.647
Your Honor, Mr. Brigante
is understandably excited...

05:31.747 --> 05:34.747
...having been vindicated
after five years of incarceration.

05:34.747 --> 05:36.647
There's no vindication here, counselor.

05:36.747 --> 05:39.447
Or absolution, or benediction,
or anything...

05:39.747 --> 05:42.347
...other than an incredible
convergence of circumstances...

05:42.447 --> 05:44.846
...which you've exploited
to your client's benefit.

05:44.946 --> 05:47.446
Your Honor, these circumstances
that you speak of...

05:47.546 --> 05:50.346
...include illegal wiretaps
and tainted evidence.

05:50.446 --> 05:53.546
This is a classic
"fruit of the poisoned tree" situation.

05:53.646 --> 05:56.246
I think after five years
of unjust incarceration...

05:56.346 --> 06:00.346
...it's reasonable to request Mr. Brigante
be indulged his right to speak.

06:00.446 --> 06:02.646
Okay, Mr. Brigante, I'm all ears.

06:03.746 --> 06:05.046
Your Honor...

06:05.646 --> 06:07.446
...with all due respect...

06:08.146 --> 06:11.246
...past and present,
and without further to-do.

06:12.846 --> 06:17.545
Let me assure this court that
I am through walkin' on the wild side.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.645
That's all I've been tryin' to tell you.

06:20.745 --> 06:25.345
I have been sick with the social ills
known in the ghetto...

06:25.845 --> 06:30.545
...but my time in the sterling
correctional facilities...

06:31.045 --> 06:35.445
...of Green Haven and Sing Sing
has not been in vain. I've been cured!

06:36.345 --> 06:38.845
Born again, like the Watergaters.

06:39.045 --> 06:42.545
I know you heard this rap before.
Your Honor, I mean it.

06:42.845 --> 06:45.045
This is the truth. I changed.

06:45.745 --> 06:48.844
I changed and it didn't take no 30 years...

06:48.944 --> 06:52.244
...like Your Honor thought, but only five.

06:52.844 --> 06:55.544
That's right, sir. Five years.

06:55.944 --> 06:59.044
And look at me. Completely rehabilitated...

06:59.544 --> 07:05.144
...reinvigorated, reassimilated,
and finally gonna be relocated.

07:05.344 --> 07:07.644
And I want to thank
a lot of people for that.

07:07.744 --> 07:10.444
I look over there and I see
that man there, Mr. Norwalk.

07:10.744 --> 07:14.644
I want to thank you, sir,
for making the tapes in an illegal fashion.

07:15.544 --> 07:21.043
I would like to thank the Court of Appeals
for reversing you, Your Honor.

07:21.543 --> 07:23.243
And I want to thank...

07:23.343 --> 07:27.643
...AImighty God, without whom
no case gets tossed.

07:28.043 --> 07:31.743
- I can't believe this.
- I must have forgot. How could I forget...

07:32.243 --> 07:35.343
...my dear, close friend and lawyer...

07:36.143 --> 07:40.943
...David Kleinfeld,
who never gave up on me...

07:41.343 --> 07:43.243
...through everything, thick and thin.

07:43.343 --> 07:46.143
- Why don't you just stand up?
- I'm sorry.

07:46.543 --> 07:49.143
- Mr. Brigante!
- Davey Kleinfeld.

07:49.443 --> 07:51.643
You're not accepting an award.

07:53.343 --> 07:54.942
Court of Appeals' decision...

07:56.342 --> 08:00.442
...and the District Attorney's
unfortunate investigative techniques...

08:01.842 --> 08:05.542
...now devolve upon me the painful duty
of unleashing upon society...

08:05.642 --> 08:09.042
...a reputed assassin
and convicted purveyor of narcotics.

08:09.242 --> 08:12.242
No. Never convicted on no dope.

08:13.342 --> 08:17.142
The indictment is dismissed.
Prisoner is discharged. Call the next case.

08:17.842 --> 08:20.042
- I'm indebted to you.
- Okay.

08:20.642 --> 08:21.942
I feel like I won.

08:22.042 --> 08:24.042
Excuse me. Congratulations.

08:27.141 --> 08:30.441
- No hard feelings, right?
- I'll be seeing you, Brigante.

08:34.841 --> 08:37.241
That was some line of crap
you handed him in there.

08:37.341 --> 08:40.941
That was no line of crap, man.
I meant every word I said.

08:41.841 --> 08:44.341
You don't understand. You don't get it.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.341
I'm a free man,
and I don't mean just out of jail.

08:47.441 --> 08:51.341
"I am free at last, free at last...

08:51.941 --> 08:57.241
- "...thank God Almighty, I am free at last!"
- I gotta work here. Save your energy.

08:57.341 --> 08:59.840
Wait till you see what I got
lined up for tonight.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.440
So what are you gonna do for money?
Hook up with Rolando again?

09:14.540 --> 09:17.540
I told you, I ain't goin' back to the street.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.740
Twenty-five years I worked that sucker.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.340
What do I got to show for it? Squat.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.040
You dancing with me
or you dancing with him?

09:27.340 --> 09:30.040
What does that mean,
"I ain't goin' back on the street"?

09:30.140 --> 09:32.339
What else do you know how to do?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.839
- I got plans, baby.
- Talk to me.

09:37.239 --> 09:40.439
'Cause you can dance
with him if you wanna.

09:41.339 --> 09:44.439
I know Dave since he was
just out of law school.

09:45.139 --> 09:48.239
He was workin' as a clerk
for a big mob lawyer.

09:48.839 --> 09:53.039
Kept a tire iron under the seat of his car,
tried like hell not to look scared...

09:53.139 --> 09:55.239
...by all his wise guy clients.

09:55.939 --> 09:59.139
But Davey Kleinfeld,
he ain't scared no more.

10:02.439 --> 10:04.038
So look at you.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.438
You really made something of your life.

10:07.538 --> 10:10.838
You put me in business.
All my first clients came through you.

10:11.038 --> 10:13.338
As I say, you know, top drawer.

10:13.638 --> 10:15.638
You're top drawer, Davey.

10:16.238 --> 10:17.538
Man.

10:18.338 --> 10:22.138
Listen, I got something for you.
You remember Saso?

10:22.638 --> 10:24.138
Saso. Yeah.

10:24.238 --> 10:26.438
Fat guy, had the Argentine place
on Madison.

10:26.638 --> 10:29.638
He bought the lease on this bankrupt disco.
Beautiful place.

10:29.738 --> 10:31.938
I got some investors together
and we backed him.

10:32.038 --> 10:33.938
I got $50,000 in the place.

10:34.038 --> 10:37.537
Problem is Saso. He's been shakin' the till,
payin' off gambling debts.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.737
He says he doesn't get $25,000,
he's gonna lose his lease.

10:40.837 --> 10:43.337
I like the place. I go there sometimes.

10:43.437 --> 10:46.037
The money's no big deal.
I don't mind puttin' it in...

10:46.137 --> 10:50.337
...as long as I know there's someone there
who's gonna run the place straight, clean.

10:50.637 --> 10:51.637
Me?

10:52.637 --> 10:55.037
I owned clubs. I never ran 'em.

10:55.637 --> 10:58.337
What's the big deal?
You step in, straighten things out...

10:58.437 --> 11:01.237
...you take a salary, a chunk of the profits.
- Please.

11:03.137 --> 11:05.537
You've done enough already for me.

11:05.737 --> 11:07.937
You call it a favor between friends.

11:08.137 --> 11:09.936
No favor. I owe you.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.936
Favor gonna kill you faster than a bullet.

11:23.236 --> 11:24.836
You saved my life.

11:27.236 --> 11:28.836
You saved my life, Dave.

11:29.636 --> 11:31.836
Thirty years. You know what that is?

11:32.636 --> 11:36.636
I was dead. I was buried.
I was under the ground.

11:38.136 --> 11:39.436
You dug me up.

11:44.235 --> 11:46.435
I don't know what to say to you.

11:47.735 --> 11:49.535
I just don't know what to say.

11:49.735 --> 11:51.135
Say you love me.

11:51.835 --> 11:53.035
I love you.

11:54.135 --> 11:57.035
If you was a broad, I'd marry you.

11:58.035 --> 12:00.135
- My boy.
- I bet you would.

12:00.335 --> 12:02.835
Who's that? Well, you know...

12:03.435 --> 12:06.735
Look, we're going to the ladies' room.

12:07.535 --> 12:08.635
Goodbye, you two.

12:08.735 --> 12:11.035
- Well, somebody's got to.
- Bye-bye.

12:20.034 --> 12:22.034
So, what are these plans?

12:23.034 --> 12:25.334
What's the big goddamn secret?

12:31.934 --> 12:34.434
You remember a guy named Clyde Bassie?

12:34.834 --> 12:37.034
Got out of the joint a couple of years ago.

12:37.834 --> 12:41.634
He went down to the Bahamas,
Paradise Island...

12:43.134 --> 12:45.534
...and he got this car rental place.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.233
He used to talk about it
all the time in the can.

12:48.433 --> 12:51.333
He got out, he went down there,
put it together.

12:51.433 --> 12:54.533
And it's doin' good. Real good.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.433
I mean, like, it's makin' money.

12:58.533 --> 13:02.233
Couple of months ago
he wrote me and he said...

13:02.833 --> 13:06.433
...I could buy in any time
I got $75,000 together.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.333
You're gonna rent cars.

13:23.132 --> 13:24.732
What are you laughing at?

13:28.432 --> 13:31.632
- You're gonna rent cars.
- That's right. I know a lot about cars.

13:31.932 --> 13:34.432
I've been stealing 'em since I was 14.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.832
Look at him laugh.

13:43.332 --> 13:45.032
I'll tell you something.

13:45.832 --> 13:48.732
Car rental guys don't get killed that much.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.031
And where are you gonna get the $75,000?

13:54.931 --> 13:58.331
I don't know. Maybe some rich relative
dies and leaves it to me.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.231
It's a dream, Dave. You gotta dream, baby.

14:04.631 --> 14:07.331
You got it all worked out, Carlito.
Here's to you.

14:10.231 --> 14:12.231
So here's me back on the street.

14:13.031 --> 14:15.831
Third Sunday in August.
Old Timer's Day in the barrio.

14:15.931 --> 14:18.731
- When did you get out, papi?
- A couple of days ago.

14:19.031 --> 14:20.331
Nothin' left.

14:20.531 --> 14:24.630
Like them old cowboy movies,
but instead of tumbleweed and cow dung...

14:25.030 --> 14:27.830
...we got stripped car wrecks and dog shit.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.030
A lot of new faces?

14:30.730 --> 14:33.530
These young guys, I don't recognize 'em.

14:36.030 --> 14:38.130
Mi barrio ya no existe.

14:39.130 --> 14:41.930
Carlito, man, Death Valley out here, man.

14:42.330 --> 14:46.330
Mira, you know me, I take to the street
with any of these motherfuckers, man.

14:46.630 --> 14:50.230
But these new kids nowadays, man,
they got no respect for human life.

14:50.230 --> 14:53.030
They shotgun you,
just to see you fly up in the air.

14:53.130 --> 14:55.230
'Chacho, you're better off in jail.

14:55.330 --> 14:57.529
I don't even go
up to black Harlem no more.

14:57.529 --> 15:00.329
They're fuckin' crazy up there.
Remember Victor?

15:00.829 --> 15:04.029
- Victor, with the beard.
- He got shot right in front of the High.

15:04.129 --> 15:06.729
Right in front of fuckin' Patrick Henry High.

15:07.029 --> 15:09.929
- Y Lalin, you know him.
- Lalin Miasso. What happened to him?

15:10.029 --> 15:13.729
Lalin's doin' thirty years in Attica, man.
Thirty years!

15:17.129 --> 15:19.929
Walberto! Check it out. Mira who's here.

15:20.029 --> 15:22.029
- Mira, eso. Oye.
- Hey, Wally.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.929
- Heavy-duty.
- Good to see you.

15:25.429 --> 15:28.028
I've been looking all over for you.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.428
Should have figured
I'd find you walking around up here...

15:31.528 --> 15:35.028
...doing a little "memory lane."
- While I still got one.

15:35.128 --> 15:39.128
- Mira, Rolando wants to talk to you.
- Carlito, I gotta get back to the game.

15:39.228 --> 15:42.028
You need anything, bodyguard,
anything, call me, okay?

15:42.128 --> 15:44.828
- You call me. Take care.
- Pachanga. Good to see you.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.528
- Rolando?
- Sí. He's around the corner.

15:49.728 --> 15:52.328
Guajiro, wait here for me.

15:52.428 --> 15:55.128
- In about five minutes, I'll be back.
- Sure, Carlito.

15:55.528 --> 15:57.628
Who is that? New back-up man?

15:57.828 --> 16:00.527
He's my little cousin.
I gotta visit my aunt later.

16:02.327 --> 16:03.927
Carlito, mi socio.

16:04.627 --> 16:06.027
¡Qué chévere!

16:08.727 --> 16:11.327
I said a prayer for you
while you were inside...

16:11.527 --> 16:14.127
...that harm will come
to him who harmed you.

16:14.427 --> 16:16.727
- Thank you.
- Siéntate. Sit down.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.827
- You are well?
- Well enough.

16:23.427 --> 16:25.627
You look like you're doing good
for yourself.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.127
Why not? Business is good.

16:28.827 --> 16:31.727
- Smack.
- The coca business.

16:32.527 --> 16:35.026
That's all there is. Heroin is dead.

16:35.726 --> 16:38.926
- But you know all of this, right?
- No, I didn't know that.

16:49.226 --> 16:51.626
Let's speak the truth between us.

16:52.626 --> 16:55.526
You did five years
and never once mentioned my name.

16:56.126 --> 16:59.326
I know that you could have given me up...

16:59.726 --> 17:03.026
...and made things easier for yourself,
but you didn't.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.525
Muy bien hecho. Good for you.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.925
But you see I got rich
while you were inside.

17:10.325 --> 17:12.724
Maybe you think I owe you?

17:14.125 --> 17:16.224
I don't want anything from you.

17:16.525 --> 17:20.025
- Who are you working with?
- I ain't working with nobody.

17:20.425 --> 17:23.025
- Nobody?
- I'm retired.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.425
- Retired?
- That's right.

17:25.724 --> 17:27.025
Retired?

17:30.325 --> 17:31.425
You're serious?

17:31.525 --> 17:34.325
I'm serious. That's right. I'm out. I quit.

17:35.025 --> 17:39.824
So, Carlito Brigante got religion, right?

17:41.124 --> 17:43.724
That's right. I'm studying to be a priest.

17:49.124 --> 17:50.924
So what are you doing these days?

17:51.024 --> 17:54.024
Nothing much. I'm still in school.

17:54.724 --> 17:56.624
I got a job though.

17:56.724 --> 17:58.524
No kidding. Doing what?

17:58.624 --> 18:01.724
Just a little legwork
for Señor Pablo Cabrales.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.824
- Cabrales.
- Yeah.

18:04.024 --> 18:07.024
What do you want to do that shit for?
That's not good.

18:07.224 --> 18:10.124
Come on, Carlito.
I'm not making a career out of it.

18:10.224 --> 18:12.423
I'm a delivery boy, that's all.

18:12.723 --> 18:14.223
Check this out.

18:15.923 --> 18:17.523
That's $30,000.

18:25.523 --> 18:27.623
Can I ask you for a favor?

18:28.623 --> 18:29.823
What's that?

18:30.023 --> 18:33.523
I gotta go down the block for this pickup.
Can you come with me?

18:34.723 --> 18:38.223
Come on. Don't get me involved
with that stuff.

18:38.323 --> 18:41.023
Come on. I know these guys.
They're friends.

18:41.123 --> 18:42.723
I just wanna walk in with you.

18:42.822 --> 18:46.122
They see my back-up
and they'll shit in their pants.

18:46.522 --> 18:49.022
- They ain't gonna know me.
- You?

18:49.022 --> 18:51.122
You're a fuckin' legend.

18:52.022 --> 18:53.022
Come on.

18:55.622 --> 18:59.222
All right. 10 minutes. I promised
your mother we'd be there for dinner.

18:59.322 --> 19:01.922
That's no problem.
These guys, they're real pros.

19:02.022 --> 19:03.522
Boom, boom, in and out.

19:27.121 --> 19:29.821
So the kid's walkin' in there with $30,000.

19:30.021 --> 19:33.721
And the legend, me,
I'm walkin' right in with him.

19:33.821 --> 19:36.321
Five minutes from now
we'll be on the streets...

19:36.421 --> 19:39.221
...with $30,000 worth of very sweet candy...

19:39.321 --> 19:42.921
...more than enough to put me
right back where I just come from.

19:43.121 --> 19:46.721
- ¿Cómo está?
- Oye, Quisqueya. ¿Qué pasa?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.920
Coño, Guajiro. Who's this?

19:51.020 --> 19:54.420
This is my cousin, man.
Primo mío, Carlito Brigante.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.720
You heard of Carlito, right?

19:57.120 --> 19:59.120
What you need him for?

19:59.220 --> 20:03.120
Tranquilo, tranquilo.
I just come along for the ride, man.

20:03.220 --> 20:05.820
Come on, Quisqueya, man.
You know Carlito, right?

20:05.920 --> 20:07.920
I got nothing here.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.920
He just got out of Lewisburg, man.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.920
He used to be partners with Rolando Rivas.

20:15.320 --> 20:19.020
Carlito. I heard of you, man.

20:19.420 --> 20:22.619
You used to run smack
with Rolando, right?

20:24.219 --> 20:25.619
Little bit.

20:25.819 --> 20:28.419
Little bit? Little bit, that's a good one.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.519
I heard you guys were the fucking kings.

20:34.019 --> 20:35.719
Lo siento, Carlito.

20:36.219 --> 20:39.019
Hermanos, take care of Carlito.

20:40.019 --> 20:42.119
We gotta do some business.

20:46.619 --> 20:48.019
Hermanito.

20:49.919 --> 20:52.519
- ¿Quierejugar?
- No, I'll watch.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.918
- We're playing eight ball.
- Good game.

21:00.418 --> 21:03.718
- You don't mind if I count it, right?
- It's all there, man.

21:04.118 --> 21:05.918
I'll count it anyway.

21:06.418 --> 21:09.018
- Maybe you'll lose a game.
- Right.

21:09.618 --> 21:13.418
- You like that shot I did, right?
- That shot ain't nothin'.

21:13.718 --> 21:15.018
Come on.

21:15.118 --> 21:17.818
What're you in a rush for?
I'll beat you again.

21:20.418 --> 21:22.318
- Damn it!
- What's the matter?

21:23.418 --> 21:26.817
- That's your bathroom there?
- That's the bathroom.

21:27.317 --> 21:28.517
Don't work.

21:30.617 --> 21:32.317
The toilet's backed up.

21:33.217 --> 21:34.617
Sorry, man.

21:35.217 --> 21:37.517
- Don't work?
- No, don't work.

21:38.417 --> 21:40.417
I can wait another week.

21:41.417 --> 21:44.317
Come back then, we'll have it fixed for you.

21:46.517 --> 21:48.817
Turn it up! I love that song!

21:57.716 --> 21:59.816
Mira, you wanna play or what?

22:00.216 --> 22:03.816
Be cool. I'm rackin', man. Shit.

22:13.116 --> 22:15.416
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.

22:22.116 --> 22:24.116
- You're playin' eight ball, right?
- Yeah.

22:24.216 --> 22:27.216
I can't resist this.
I gotta show you people a shot.

22:27.416 --> 22:30.915
- We're in the middle of a game here!
- You're playin' eight ball.

22:31.015 --> 22:34.815
Right before you rack. It's nothin'.
It ain't gonna bother your game.

22:35.315 --> 22:38.115
You ain't gonna believe this.
Gonna line 'em up like this.

22:38.315 --> 22:42.315
- You gonna show us a trick shot?
- No trick shot. This is magic time.

22:43.715 --> 22:47.715
After you see this shot,
you're gonna give up your religious beliefs.

22:49.215 --> 22:51.115
Quisqueya, you gotta check this out.

22:51.215 --> 22:54.315
- Carlito's doin' one of his trick shots.
- Guajiro.

22:54.815 --> 22:56.915
I ain't done counting yet.

23:00.715 --> 23:03.014
You want a cold beer, hermano?

23:04.814 --> 23:06.514
Help yourself, man.

23:06.714 --> 23:09.214
- Took me six months to learn this shot.
- Six months?

23:09.314 --> 23:11.514
- You gotta help me though.
- Sure.

23:13.114 --> 23:14.114
See this?

23:14.214 --> 23:15.614
- Over the 12.
- Okay.

23:15.814 --> 23:19.614
- So how's your boss?
- He's good. I saw him this morning.

23:22.314 --> 23:26.814
Put your finger right here,
right on top of the 12, to hold it there, see?

23:27.114 --> 23:29.914
- Like that?
- You gotta get it even with that.

23:37.713 --> 23:40.213
- So you didn't hear the news?
- What news?

23:40.513 --> 23:42.713
There's no beer down here, man.

23:42.913 --> 23:45.013
Sure, way down in the bottom.

23:46.513 --> 23:49.213
Me and Clyde Bassie were working on this.

23:49.313 --> 23:52.313
You lookin' at that nine?
Let me have your cue.

23:53.313 --> 23:54.413
Line 'em up.

23:55.913 --> 23:58.313
- They even?
- They look even to me.

23:59.513 --> 24:02.113
Come on, Quisqueya. What news?

24:07.413 --> 24:09.512
Your boss is dead and so are you.

25:01.511 --> 25:03.011
I'm reloaded!

25:06.711 --> 25:09.111
Come on in here, motherfuckers!

25:11.311 --> 25:13.610
Come on, I'm waitin' for ya!

25:21.010 --> 25:22.510
You ain't comin' in?

25:24.410 --> 25:25.910
I'm comin' out!

25:28.110 --> 25:30.910
You're up against it now, motherfuckers!

25:31.710 --> 25:34.410
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out!

25:36.510 --> 25:38.610
You think you're big time?

25:39.510 --> 25:42.010
You're gonna fuckin' die big time!

25:47.409 --> 25:48.809
You ready?

25:52.709 --> 25:54.409
Here comes the pain!

26:25.008 --> 26:26.308
Oh, Jesus.

26:27.108 --> 26:29.208
Jesus Christ, look at you.

26:32.108 --> 26:34.708
You said they were friends, Guajiro...

26:35.908 --> 26:39.108
...but there ain't no friends
in this shit business.

27:01.007 --> 27:02.507
Adiós, primo.

27:07.607 --> 27:09.507
All right, what happened?

27:18.207 --> 27:20.407
Ain't no more rackets out here...

27:20.507 --> 27:23.506
...just a bunch of cowboys
ripping each other off.

27:30.506 --> 27:34.106
I don't invite this shit. It just comes to me.

27:35.406 --> 27:37.606
I run, it runs after me.

27:39.306 --> 27:41.406
Gotta be somewhere to hide.

27:43.006 --> 27:47.806
So I took a look at this, Saso's place.
It's good. It's a nice location.

27:48.306 --> 27:51.406
Somebody ran it right,
it could do good business.

27:52.006 --> 27:54.406
Great. I'll advance you $25,000.

27:55.105 --> 27:57.505
No, I'm gonna put my own money in.

27:58.105 --> 28:00.705
Your own money? What money is that?

28:00.805 --> 28:04.805
I ran into Rolando.
He owed me from an old thing, $25,000...

28:05.205 --> 28:08.305
...so, that's the only way
I'm gonna do it, Dave.

28:10.505 --> 28:12.105
You got it. Terrific.

28:12.805 --> 28:15.405
So you'll call Saso,
tell him I'll see him tonight.

28:15.505 --> 28:20.205
Done. I want to talk to you
about something. I need a little favor.

28:20.305 --> 28:23.805
It's no big deal, but I need a bodyguard.
Somebody good.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.204
Who's bothering you? I know 'em?

28:28.404 --> 28:30.904
It's no big deal.
Just a little misunderstanding.

28:31.004 --> 28:33.704
If it's no big deal,
what do you need a bodyguard for?

28:34.004 --> 28:36.504
Will you trust me on this?
It's just temporary.

28:36.604 --> 28:40.304
I'll get someone of my own later,
but I want someone right away.

28:41.004 --> 28:45.604
There's Pachanga,
one of the old barrio crowd. He's good.

28:46.904 --> 28:48.004
Great.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.504
You okay?

28:54.604 --> 28:56.504
I got a good feeling about this club.

28:56.604 --> 28:59.104
I think we're gonna make
some real money.

29:00.603 --> 29:02.803
I got a good feeling about it too...

29:03.003 --> 29:05.103
...but as soon as I make my $75,000...

29:06.203 --> 29:07.703
...I'm splittin'.

29:08.203 --> 29:09.703
That's right.

29:10.103 --> 29:13.403
You're gonna rent Ford Pintos
to tourists in Paradise.

29:13.503 --> 29:16.503
That's right,
with a big smile on my face, too.

30:17.001 --> 30:18.701
Times have changed.

30:19.101 --> 30:21.201
What happened to the miniskirts?

30:21.301 --> 30:23.401
Where's all that marijuana?

30:23.701 --> 30:28.501
Now everything is platforms, cocaine,
and dances I don't dance.

30:29.301 --> 30:32.501
What a man gotta come to
when he loses five years.

30:33.501 --> 30:36.801
But some shit never changes, like Saso.

30:37.300 --> 30:41.200
Charlie, my friend! Charlie Brigante!
How you doing?

30:41.400 --> 30:42.700
Hey, Saso.

30:42.900 --> 30:46.100
No, no more Saso.
Now everybody calls me Ron.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.100
- Ron?
- Ron from Reinaldo.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.100
Okay, Ron, let's get to the point.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.100
I hear you're doing good business
with this place.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.600
- Very good.
- So how come you need money?

30:58.900 --> 31:01.100
- Me?
- You gamblin' again, right?

31:01.200 --> 31:02.700
How much you owe?

31:04.900 --> 31:07.700
I don't know, maybe $50,000 or $60,000.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.099
That means about $100,000.
Who you owe the money to?

31:11.199 --> 31:13.399
You know, Charles, some of the boys.

31:13.499 --> 31:18.399
$25,000 will quiet them for now,
and you'll come in for a quarter of my end.

31:18.999 --> 31:22.699
Okay, I'm gonna give you
$25,000 cash tomorrow.

31:22.999 --> 31:25.099
I'm gonna come in for half your end.

31:26.799 --> 31:28.699
What are you trying to do to me?

31:28.799 --> 31:33.299
What I'm trying to do, Saso,
I mean Ron, is save your ass.

31:34.299 --> 31:38.399
Right, because it's either Fat Anthony
or Scooze you owe the money to, right?

31:38.499 --> 31:41.399
Either way, you're gonna end up
in the trunk of a car...

31:41.499 --> 31:43.798
...somewhere on the Belt Parkway
before long.

31:43.898 --> 31:47.098
May be weeks before they find you.
Like DeeDee.

31:47.198 --> 31:49.498
Remember? They open her up.

31:49.998 --> 31:52.498
That's some kind of stink
you're gonna make.

31:53.198 --> 31:56.398
"What's that smell?" Saso, man.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.298
That's Saso. Used to be Ron.

32:00.098 --> 32:02.398
Okay, okay. What time tomorrow?

32:05.098 --> 32:09.098
So here's me in the club
playing Humphrey Bogart.

32:09.498 --> 32:13.898
Things can get very sticky after hours,
so I bring in Pachanga...

32:14.398 --> 32:16.097
...little extra back-up.

32:16.197 --> 32:18.397
He thinks I'm gonna make him rich...

32:18.597 --> 32:21.797
...so he's worried I'm gonna get killed
before he scores.

32:21.897 --> 32:24.697
I heard about that shit with your cousin.

32:24.697 --> 32:27.297
Why didn't you call me
so I could watch your ass?

32:27.397 --> 32:30.097
That happened a month ago.
You just found out?

32:30.197 --> 32:33.697
You got me chasin' Kleinberg
in the daytime and then you got me here...

32:33.797 --> 32:37.897
Kleinfeld! I hope you're doin' a better job
with him than you are with me.

32:38.197 --> 32:39.697
The guy got a lot of money.

32:39.797 --> 32:43.197
He got a safe in the office
with stacks of hundreds just waitin'...

32:43.297 --> 32:46.297
Kleinfeld is my brother. Look at me.

32:47.396 --> 32:48.996
He is my brother.

32:49.296 --> 32:51.196
Pachanga's only fuckin' around.

32:51.296 --> 32:53.496
Don't fuck around.
Just keep your eyes open.

32:53.596 --> 32:55.396
Watch the bar. They're stealin' money.

32:55.496 --> 32:58.796
I wanna try, but it's so dark in here.
What do you want me to do?

32:59.496 --> 33:02.496
The guy over there says
he don't have to pay.

33:02.896 --> 33:05.996
- What guy is that?
- The guy in the red over there.

33:10.296 --> 33:11.496
What are you doin'?

33:11.596 --> 33:14.096
- Shut up and kiss me.
- Excuse me.

33:14.696 --> 33:18.296
- Something wrong with the check?
- Yeah, there's something wrong with it.

33:18.396 --> 33:20.495
- Baby, come on...
- Mira!

33:21.395 --> 33:23.295
- Benny!
- What, man?

33:23.695 --> 33:27.995
Shit. Fuck. Shit, man.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brigante.

33:28.095 --> 33:30.095
I'm sorry. I got no problem.

33:30.195 --> 33:34.095
See, Fat Man Saso there owes me money
and he's a little slow in paying me.

33:34.195 --> 33:37.695
So I'm just working it off for him.
We haven't been formally introduced.

33:37.795 --> 33:41.195
- My name is Benny Blanco from the Bronx.
- You know me?

33:41.195 --> 33:44.695
I know you. You're Carlito Brigante,
motherfucker-to-the-max.

33:45.095 --> 33:49.095
I don't know you.
So I don't owe you. Saso does.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.795
My place now, new rules.

33:52.294 --> 33:54.594
Everybody pays. Okay?

33:55.494 --> 33:57.294
Okay. That's cool, that's groovy.

33:57.294 --> 34:01.294
What's the matter with you?
Pay the fuckin' goddamn check, bitch.

34:01.394 --> 34:03.894
- To the waiter.
- To the waiter, you dumb fuck!

34:03.994 --> 34:06.894
And get us some champagne,
some of that French shit.

34:07.694 --> 34:08.893
Have a glass, man.

34:09.094 --> 34:11.393
- No, thank you...
- I wanna pick your brain.

34:11.494 --> 34:13.293
Get him a chair. The man is standing!

34:13.393 --> 34:16.094
Get him a chair.
Get the stupid look off your face.

34:16.194 --> 34:18.393
You know who this man is?

34:18.694 --> 34:22.694
This man here, he's the fuckin' J.P. Morgan
of the smack business.

34:23.293 --> 34:24.893
First time I ever heard that.

34:24.993 --> 34:28.893
Come on, man. You had 90, 100 guys
on the street. Right?

34:28.993 --> 34:31.793
- Something like that.
- I'm starting out small.

34:31.793 --> 34:33.592
I'm just building my organization.

34:33.693 --> 34:36.293
I'm refining it
and maximizing my potentialities.

34:36.393 --> 34:38.993
I got my finger on some shit
that's about to explode.

34:39.092 --> 34:40.793
If you can just give me two minutes...

34:40.893 --> 34:44.092
- Maybe next time. All the best to ya.
- Two minutes of your time.

34:44.193 --> 34:45.693
I'll talk to you again.

34:47.493 --> 34:50.293
Just two minutes. That's all.

34:51.193 --> 34:52.693
Fucking kids.

34:52.893 --> 34:56.493
Move a couple of ounces,
think they're a big shot.

34:57.192 --> 35:00.492
Make a few bucks while I'm in the joint,
I gotta respect 'em.

35:00.692 --> 35:02.892
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck that shit.

35:05.992 --> 35:07.592
Talk to me about this.

35:21.892 --> 35:25.792
Carlito, I see you was talkin'
to Benny Blanco before.

35:31.991 --> 35:33.691
Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

35:33.991 --> 35:36.591
- They say he's comin' up in the world.
- Do they?

35:37.091 --> 35:38.491
He's got a big future...

35:38.991 --> 35:40.991
...if he can live past next week.

35:43.791 --> 35:46.791
How come a good-lookin' dude like you...

35:47.291 --> 35:48.891
...doesn't have a woman?

35:48.991 --> 35:52.091
Well, I guess I'm a workaholic.

35:54.591 --> 35:56.291
What's the matter?

35:56.391 --> 35:58.891
Don't you ever see nobody
you like in here?

36:01.491 --> 36:03.290
Nobody but you, Stef.

36:08.690 --> 36:10.790
Jesus, she looks like Gail.

36:11.390 --> 36:14.190
Same color hair. The way she dances.

36:15.490 --> 36:18.590
I met Gail a year before
I went into thejoint.

36:19.090 --> 36:22.190
She was this dancer,
this artistic ballet-type...

36:22.590 --> 36:24.890
...was gonna be a big Broadway star.

36:25.290 --> 36:27.290
I guess she fell in love.

36:27.590 --> 36:32.590
Me too. I swore I'd never break her heart,
but, you know, things happen.

36:34.689 --> 36:36.389
I miss you, Gail.

37:16.188 --> 37:19.488
When you're in thejoint
you spend all your time...

37:19.688 --> 37:23.288
...dopin' out who you're gonna see
the first day you're out.

37:23.488 --> 37:25.788
The second day. The third.

37:26.688 --> 37:31.188
But then you get out, everybody's got
a different face than you remember.

37:32.288 --> 37:33.988
Maybe you do too.

37:34.288 --> 37:37.188
You pray for one face that didn't change.

37:39.187 --> 37:41.387
One face that still knows you...

37:42.787 --> 37:45.587
...looks at you the same way it always did.

39:38.484 --> 39:42.084
I couldn't figure it out.
I couldn't get that thing to save my life.

39:42.984 --> 39:44.884
- Bye, Gail.
- See you next week.

39:44.884 --> 39:46.884
- I know you, lady.
- Buzz off.

39:47.584 --> 39:49.983
Sure, you used to go out with that guy.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.483
What's his name? That good-looking guy.

39:53.183 --> 39:56.683
Yeah, Carlito Brigante. That's right.

40:02.083 --> 40:03.483
Hello, Gail.

40:14.083 --> 40:18.783
I was in the road company
of this show called Songbird last year.

40:18.883 --> 40:21.383
I played the Governor's daughter.

40:21.582 --> 40:24.482
It wasn't the lead, but it was a great part.

40:25.182 --> 40:28.982
And I did this musical book show
last year in Vegas.

40:29.982 --> 40:33.282
I hated the weather. You ever been there?

40:33.982 --> 40:37.082
Vegas? Yeah.
So are you in something now?

40:37.282 --> 40:39.382
I can come downtown and see you.

40:39.682 --> 40:44.682
I'm just, you know, doing club dates
right now, mostly one-nighters though.

40:45.782 --> 40:49.582
But I'm up for this play that goes this fall...

40:49.982 --> 40:51.182
That's great.

40:51.482 --> 40:54.381
You're livin' what
you always dreamed about.

40:57.281 --> 40:58.781
I'm getting close.

40:58.881 --> 41:02.481
I am getting close.
I'm not there yet, but it's okay.

41:09.481 --> 41:11.481
What was it like inside?

41:13.581 --> 41:15.081
No big thing.

41:16.681 --> 41:20.081
A lot of push-ups. A lot of wasted time.

41:21.581 --> 41:25.181
- You're out now.
- Yeah. Here I am.

41:30.480 --> 41:34.880
Am I outta line? Just poppin' up like this
after all these years?

41:36.380 --> 41:38.380
You still pissed at me?

41:41.980 --> 41:43.680
What do you think?

41:46.180 --> 41:48.380
You dumped me hard, Charlie.

41:52.180 --> 41:54.780
Now you want to tell me
it was for my own good, right?

41:54.880 --> 41:59.079
No, it was for mine. It was for mine.

41:59.279 --> 42:01.979
It was for my own good.
I was doin' thirty years.

42:02.079 --> 42:05.679
What was I supposed to do? I knew
you were gonna try and wait for me.

42:05.779 --> 42:09.179
You were gonna visit me,
make me think about you all the time.

42:09.279 --> 42:13.079
Now what was I supposed to do?
There I am sittin' in jail...

42:13.879 --> 42:16.679
...wonderin' all the time where you are...

42:16.679 --> 42:19.179
...what you're doin', who you're with.

42:19.379 --> 42:21.479
That'd have drove me crazy.

42:21.779 --> 42:24.079
It'd have killed me. Believe me.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.979
Best to just cut it clean, you know?

42:32.278 --> 42:34.478
Do my time with a clear head.

42:36.078 --> 42:38.478
So, now what?

42:43.778 --> 42:48.178
Now what? I don't know.
I'm here. I'm out.

42:49.378 --> 42:51.378
For whatever that's worth.

42:53.378 --> 42:55.678
What about this club of yours?

42:56.078 --> 42:59.978
It's not my club, you know.
I just got a piece of it.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.978
Just trying to make enough money...

43:06.777 --> 43:08.977
With my luck,
somebody's gonna get shot...

43:09.077 --> 43:12.477
...the cops are gonna come
and close it down, you know.

43:15.777 --> 43:17.877
That doesn't sound like you.

43:18.977 --> 43:20.977
It doesn't? Really?

43:21.977 --> 43:24.177
You never talked like this before.

43:24.277 --> 43:26.377
Never felt like this before.

43:28.177 --> 43:29.877
It's a funny thing.

43:30.277 --> 43:33.777
This guy, this counselor at Lewisburg...

43:33.877 --> 43:36.276
...Mr. Seawald, once said to me:

43:37.276 --> 43:40.476
"Charlie, you run out of steam.

43:41.676 --> 43:45.276
"You can't sprint all the way.
You gotta stop sometime.

43:46.276 --> 43:49.476
"You can't buck it forever.
It catches up to you.

43:50.276 --> 43:51.676
"It gets you.

43:54.676 --> 43:56.576
"You don't get reformed...

43:58.276 --> 44:00.276
"...you just run out of wind."

44:13.975 --> 44:15.475
I'd better go.

44:18.975 --> 44:20.975
Can I call you sometime?

44:23.075 --> 44:25.375
Why don't you let me call you?

44:29.175 --> 44:32.075
- You know where to find me, right?
- Yeah.

44:51.174 --> 44:53.674
You said you wouldn't break my heart.

44:57.674 --> 44:59.974
I know. I'm sorry.

45:04.974 --> 45:06.274
I'm sorry.

45:13.474 --> 45:14.873
Good night.

45:56.272 --> 45:58.772
Mr. Taglialucci to see his lawyer,
Mr. Kleinfeld.

45:58.972 --> 46:00.272
Go ahead.

46:02.272 --> 46:04.072
Tony, how are you?

46:05.172 --> 46:08.572
- Okay, Jackson, beat it.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Taglialucci.

46:11.672 --> 46:13.172
You look good.

46:13.672 --> 46:17.672
Don't make me do it, Kleinfeld.
Just write this down, all right?

46:18.771 --> 46:22.571
It's 555-5888.

46:23.671 --> 46:25.871
That's my kid Frankie's
home phone number...

46:25.971 --> 46:28.071
...and I'll tell you why in a minute.

46:30.471 --> 46:31.771
Shut up!

46:40.171 --> 46:43.771
I never liked you, Kleinfeld.
Not 'cause you're a Jew.

46:44.271 --> 46:47.571
I know plenty of Jews.
It's 'cause you're a lyin' piece of shit.

46:47.771 --> 46:52.270
Now, I give you a million bucks to make
a simple payoff and nothin' happens.

46:52.270 --> 46:55.070
Look, I told your son
I gave Nicky the money personally.

46:55.170 --> 46:58.270
If he decides to betray that
and testify against you anyway...

46:58.370 --> 47:01.170
...I can hardly be...
- You look at my hands.

47:01.470 --> 47:06.070
Now, you make me raise my voice
and I'll snap your neck like a bread stick.

47:06.970 --> 47:09.570
You fuckin' phony.
What do you take me for?

47:09.870 --> 47:12.270
Nicky never saw dollar one of my money.

47:12.370 --> 47:15.470
My million bucks went straight
into your pockets.

47:15.870 --> 47:19.670
- I personally...
- Don't fuckin' lie to me, you scumbag.

47:19.770 --> 47:23.470
You lie to me again,
you're gonna end up in that river out there.

47:23.969 --> 47:27.269
You think about this when you go out,
and you'll take a look down...

47:27.469 --> 47:29.469
...and imagine what it'll feel like...

47:29.469 --> 47:34.369
...slidin' around down the bottom with eels
and crabs crawlin' outta your eyeballs.

47:40.769 --> 47:42.269
What do you want from me?

47:43.569 --> 47:47.569
- I understand you got a boat.
- Yeah.

47:48.869 --> 47:52.369
- You're gonna get me outta here.
- I'm doing every...

47:52.669 --> 47:55.369
My entire office is devoted
to your appeal right now.

47:55.469 --> 47:59.068
- I talked to the judge this morning.
- I ain't talkin' about no appeal.

47:59.168 --> 48:01.668
I'm talkin' about you bustin' me outta here.

48:07.468 --> 48:08.468
I'm a lawyer.

48:08.568 --> 48:12.468
Listen, you lawyer-fuck,
I got a million-dollar credit with you.

48:13.268 --> 48:16.168
My kid Frankie'll go with you
and keep an eye on you...

48:16.268 --> 48:18.068
...make sure everything goes right.

48:18.068 --> 48:20.968
You see that guard
that brought me in here?

48:21.268 --> 48:25.368
He's been taken care of, and he's gonna
set it up to get me into the water.

48:25.768 --> 48:30.167
All you gotta do is be there
with the boat to pick me up.

48:33.767 --> 48:35.767
This is not exactly the kind of...

48:35.867 --> 48:37.967
The contract's already down on you, pal.

48:38.467 --> 48:41.767
The guys, the guns,
the lime pit's already dug.

48:41.867 --> 48:46.167
You understand?
And from in here, just one button I push.

49:25.666 --> 49:26.266
What?

49:26.366 --> 49:28.766
Mr. Norwalk from
the District Attorney's office.

49:29.866 --> 49:31.566
I said no calls!

49:31.666 --> 49:33.166
No, he's here.

49:40.465 --> 49:42.065
Mr. Kleinfeld?

49:42.465 --> 49:44.265
Give me a second, please.

49:51.365 --> 49:54.465
- Mr. Kleinfeld, are you there?
- Send him in.

50:03.465 --> 50:05.065
How are you?

50:05.665 --> 50:09.364
- Good to see you. Have a seat.
- Hope you don't mind. I was in the area.

50:09.464 --> 50:12.864
Not at all. As a matter of fact,
I was about to call you.

50:16.864 --> 50:19.364
Your problems aren't just
going to go away.

50:39.463 --> 50:42.563
Here's me in the club countin' every dollar.

50:43.563 --> 50:48.063
On top of the $25,000 I put in,
I already pulled out another $14,000.

50:49.863 --> 50:54.063
$35,000 or $40,000 more,
and I'm gone, daddy, gone.

50:54.663 --> 50:56.563
Two, maybe three months.

50:58.163 --> 51:00.163
Just gotta mark time now...

51:00.463 --> 51:02.763
...lie low, keep outta trouble...

51:03.463 --> 51:05.463
...and off people's minds.

51:08.763 --> 51:10.862
Lalin is here. In the office.

51:10.962 --> 51:13.462
- Lalin?
- You wanna see him?

51:13.962 --> 51:17.562
- You told me he was doin' thirty years.
- I guess he got out.

51:18.762 --> 51:21.962
- How's he doin'?
- Not as good as you, but, you know...

51:22.062 --> 51:23.862
I don't know what that means.

51:25.862 --> 51:30.062
Lalin was a neighborhood guy,
real good-lookin' son of a bitch.

51:30.162 --> 51:33.862
He used to work in
this private gamblingjoint on West 87th.

51:34.162 --> 51:38.362
He was kind of a greeter for the place,
set guys up with broads.

51:39.362 --> 51:41.862
Now anybody ask me about Lalin...

51:42.662 --> 51:45.661
...I have to say, he's a stand-up guy.

51:55.661 --> 51:58.461
- Look at you, man, look at you.
- Hey, hermano.

51:58.561 --> 52:00.961
How you doin', man? What a place.

52:01.061 --> 52:02.861
What happened to you?

52:03.561 --> 52:05.661
What do you mean? You didn't hear?

52:06.361 --> 52:08.361
I took a few in the back.

52:09.161 --> 52:12.461
When the street's really mad at you,
she don't put you in a box...

52:12.561 --> 52:14.661
...she puts you in one of these things.

52:16.360 --> 52:19.760
- ¿ Tu quieres?
- No. I'm workin'.

52:19.860 --> 52:23.360
- How about a drink? You want one?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

52:27.260 --> 52:29.860
Pachanga, tell me what's goin' on up there.

52:30.060 --> 52:31.660
Come on, man, tell me.

52:34.060 --> 52:35.560
Take care, all right?

52:38.360 --> 52:41.360
I seen that chick
you used to go around with.

52:43.460 --> 52:44.960
The one from the Bahamas.

52:45.060 --> 52:47.860
You know, la rubia.
The one that looks like my sister.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.159
That's Gail.

52:49.959 --> 52:52.959
I seen her in this show
on 48th and Broadway.

52:53.659 --> 52:55.159
When was this?

52:56.059 --> 52:58.859
Two weeks ago.
She was in this fantastic show.

52:58.959 --> 53:04.459
I mean, like artistic, you know,
but a lot of talent.

53:05.259 --> 53:07.359
That girl's got a lot of talent.

53:08.459 --> 53:09.859
48th and Broadway?

53:13.359 --> 53:15.359
Let me get another drink.

53:16.759 --> 53:20.459
So, you back in business?

53:21.058 --> 53:25.458
I'm retired, Lalin. Told you that.
No more business for me.

53:27.258 --> 53:31.558
Come on. All them people in Lewisburg
and you're telling me you didn't connect?

53:31.958 --> 53:36.158
I did a lot of reading.
Worked on my appeal, that kind of thing.

53:37.358 --> 53:39.458
What about you? What is this?

53:39.758 --> 53:42.258
Pachanga told me
you was doin' thirty years.

53:43.458 --> 53:45.158
Yeah. Beat it.

53:45.758 --> 53:47.958
You beat it? How'd you do that?

53:50.058 --> 53:52.558
You know, like you, I did a lot of reading...

53:52.558 --> 53:56.257
...and I worked with some guys,
some smart guys in the joint...

53:56.757 --> 53:58.857
...and just beat it, that's all.

53:59.157 --> 54:01.357
No shit. That's good.

54:02.557 --> 54:03.757
Here's to you.

54:04.757 --> 54:06.557
To you. "Free at last."

54:11.857 --> 54:16.857
Listen, I'm in with some new people now.
Unos italianos, tú sabes.

54:16.957 --> 54:19.557
They trust you.
They think you're a fuckin' guinea.

54:19.657 --> 54:22.757
- Where are they from? Pleasant Avenue?
- Downtown.

54:22.957 --> 54:26.056
Anyway, they got the money.
They got a lot of money.

54:26.056 --> 54:30.356
Some heavy paper. They go up to $25,000
for a key, if it's good shit, you know.

54:30.456 --> 54:35.556
They want regular street people,
gente del barrio. Old school all the way.

54:35.556 --> 54:39.456
- Stand-up guys like us, right, Lalin?
- Old school, baby.

54:39.556 --> 54:42.656
So what you say? You and me,
just like old times.

54:42.756 --> 54:44.956
You bring the people you're with now.

54:45.056 --> 54:49.956
I ain't with nobody. I told you that.
I ain't connected no more.

54:50.556 --> 54:54.156
Come on, man!
You forget who you're talking to?

55:10.455 --> 55:12.055
- Look at this.
- Wait a minute.

55:12.155 --> 55:15.555
This how you beat your thirty years,
you piece of shit?

55:15.655 --> 55:18.955
- Let me explain.
- I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

55:19.255 --> 55:23.355
- Fuckin' push you in the fuckin' river!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

55:23.455 --> 55:26.255
Wait a minute. Wait a fuckin' second!

55:26.355 --> 55:31.554
You a fuckin' chivo, man?
You a fuckin' rat? I'll fuckin' kill him!

55:31.654 --> 55:33.654
Let me kill him for you!

55:33.754 --> 55:36.254
Let him fuckin' kill me! Fuck you!

55:36.454 --> 55:39.054
Kill me, you motherfucker!
Look what I got!

55:39.554 --> 55:43.254
I mean, look at me! You got everything!

55:43.754 --> 55:45.354
I mean, come on!

55:46.154 --> 55:50.054
Look what I gotta fucking go around with:
Fucking diapers!

55:50.654 --> 55:53.254
I got fucking diapers!
I shit in my pants every day!

55:53.354 --> 55:55.454
I can't walk, I can't hump.

55:57.354 --> 56:00.054
Go ahead and kill me, you cocksucker!

56:06.953 --> 56:10.253
They made me do it, or they send me back.

56:10.353 --> 56:13.453
I'm no good in the joint.
I'm in a fucking wheelchair.

56:19.253 --> 56:22.553
- It wasn't even turned on.
- Who sent you? Listen to me now.

56:23.053 --> 56:24.553
Who sent you?

56:25.753 --> 56:28.453
- Who sent you, motherfucker?
- The D.A.

56:28.553 --> 56:29.753
Norwalk?

56:31.553 --> 56:35.652
- Norwalk?
- He got a hard-on for you, man.

56:35.752 --> 56:38.152
Got a tip you were dealing again, big time.

56:38.252 --> 56:40.852
I was dealing? Who told him that?

56:40.952 --> 56:44.552
I been clean. I haven't made
one fuckin' move. Who told him that?

56:44.652 --> 56:46.552
- I don't know.
- Who told him that?

56:46.652 --> 56:49.152
Man, I swear to God, I don't know!

56:53.152 --> 56:56.652
I would never give you up.
I would never do that.

56:56.752 --> 56:58.452
I was gonna give you a signal.

56:58.552 --> 57:02.352
It wasn't even turned on.
It's something else, man!

57:03.052 --> 57:04.552
Look, let me...

57:06.952 --> 57:09.651
Just do it, man! Just fuckin' kill me.

57:10.751 --> 57:12.651
I ain't gonna kill you.

57:16.551 --> 57:18.951
I ain't even gonna hurt you.

57:22.651 --> 57:23.951
I ask you...

57:25.451 --> 57:29.451
...how can you fuck the only people
who ever cared for you?

57:30.451 --> 57:32.751
How do you do that?

57:34.551 --> 57:36.451
You lost, motherfucker.

57:38.751 --> 57:41.050
I'm gonna get somebody to wheel you out.

57:41.150 --> 57:42.750
Déjame explicar...

57:47.350 --> 57:50.550
Some fuck told Norwalk
I was dealin' again.

57:53.750 --> 57:54.950
Come in.

57:58.150 --> 58:00.150
Do you know who it was?

58:02.750 --> 58:06.750
All I know is he sent somebody
to talk to me wearin' a wire.

58:06.950 --> 58:08.650
That son of a bitch.

58:09.250 --> 58:11.550
He's been leaning on me too,
about other shit.

58:11.650 --> 58:16.049
I ain't dealin'. I ain't goin'
back to prison no matter what!

58:16.549 --> 58:20.849
Relax. You're not dealing,
so he can't have anything on you.

58:21.049 --> 58:24.849
This is the way this guy is.
He's on a goddamn fishing expedition.

58:24.949 --> 58:27.749
I'll take care of it. All right? Come on.

58:30.649 --> 58:32.449
Fuckin' Lalin, man.

58:34.149 --> 58:35.449
He has nobody.

58:36.849 --> 58:38.349
He has nobody left.

58:55.348 --> 58:58.048
How about you, sir? Check it out, man.

58:58.648 --> 59:01.348
What's up, man? Check it out.
What's happenin', man?

59:01.448 --> 59:03.848
Cool, man. Take that.

01:01:01.844 --> 01:01:03.244
This is a surprise.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:05.544
Big surprise.

01:01:06.244 --> 01:01:07.744
Diet Pepsi.

01:01:12.244 --> 01:01:15.944
You were really terrific.

01:01:16.144 --> 01:01:18.244
- I mean, really...
- Thanks.

01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:21.244
...very, how do I say...

01:01:23.044 --> 01:01:24.244
Sexy?

01:01:24.944 --> 01:01:28.043
- Exactly.
- That is the desired effect.

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:33.643
- Miss, that was just wonderful!
- Really, really wonderful!

01:01:33.643 --> 01:01:36.643
- Thank you very much.
- Really, really wonderful.

01:01:36.643 --> 01:01:38.143
Thanks a lot.

01:01:42.043 --> 01:01:43.143
Fans.

01:01:50.643 --> 01:01:52.243
What's the matter?

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:56.643
Nothin'. No, I was just...

01:01:59.943 --> 01:02:02.042
This situation, I think, maybe is...

01:02:02.142 --> 01:02:04.642
Situation?

01:02:04.842 --> 01:02:09.442
I didn't expect this kind of thing.
That's all.

01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:13.842
I mean, you told me you was
in a musical of some sort.

01:02:14.542 --> 01:02:16.842
I thought you was doin' a Broadway show.

01:02:16.842 --> 01:02:19.942
You told me the Governor's daughter,
whatever you were playing.

01:02:20.042 --> 01:02:21.942
And I come here and see this.

01:02:22.842 --> 01:02:25.142
Not that there's anything wrong with this.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:27.642
Wait a second. I work hard here.

01:02:28.142 --> 01:02:33.641
I dance. I get well-paid for it.
I don't fuck anybody.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:36.641
I didn't say that. Now, please.

01:02:36.741 --> 01:02:39.241
You're sitting there judging me.

01:02:39.341 --> 01:02:42.341
I'm not judgin' you. Please don't say that.

01:02:42.641 --> 01:02:47.241
I don't judge you.
What do you do that's so wonderful?

01:02:47.541 --> 01:02:49.841
You ever kill anybody, Charlie?

01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:02.141
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:06.440
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
just busted in like this.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.540
My fault. I apologize.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.840
I better go now.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.040
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go home.

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.140
When am I gonna see you again?

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.040
Why don't you surprise me another time?

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.140
- Like when?
- I can't tell you that.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:32.540
- Why not?
- 'Cause it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

01:03:39.739 --> 01:03:42.139
You know I want to feel your ass.

01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:44.239
You already know my ass.

01:03:51.739 --> 01:03:52.939
Come with me.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.439
What the fuck are you lookin' at me for?

01:04:05.539 --> 01:04:07.139
- Benny!
- How ya doin'?

01:04:10.838 --> 01:04:14.138
- Benny Blanco from the Bronx!
- Hey, fat man.

01:04:14.338 --> 01:04:15.938
The fattest man.

01:04:16.738 --> 01:04:18.838
- Where's my money?
- What money?

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:21.938
My money, man! You play pussy,
you gonna get fucked!

01:04:22.138 --> 01:04:23.538
Are you kidding?

01:04:25.438 --> 01:04:27.038
- Where's Steffie?
- Steffie?

01:04:27.038 --> 01:04:29.438
Get me Steffie, man. I'm lonely.

01:04:29.738 --> 01:04:32.038
- Sí. Dígame.
- ¿Dónde está Steffie?

01:04:32.238 --> 01:04:34.938
- Yo la vi por ahí.
- Vete a buscarla ya.

01:04:36.238 --> 01:04:37.438
Muy bien.

01:05:03.737 --> 01:05:05.237
¡Madre de Dios!

01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:09.137
After that, she got six fucking kids.

01:05:09.837 --> 01:05:13.337
There is a problem with Mr. Kleinfeld.

01:05:13.737 --> 01:05:17.436
- What kind of problem?
- He's in the bathroom fucking Steffie.

01:05:18.536 --> 01:05:21.636
So, what's the problem? Good for him.

01:05:21.836 --> 01:05:24.436
But she belongs to Benny Blanco now.

01:05:24.836 --> 01:05:25.536
Who?

01:05:25.836 --> 01:05:28.136
You remember Benny Blanco
from the Bronx?

01:05:28.236 --> 01:05:32.136
- That little piece of shit from the other day.
- Not that guy. Fuck him.

01:05:32.236 --> 01:05:35.536
He's here, and he's gonna make trouble.

01:05:35.636 --> 01:05:37.536
- Where is he?
- Over there.

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:45.136
Fuck him! Don't worry
about Benny Blanco. Go ahead, it's okay.

01:05:46.436 --> 01:05:48.835
What do I do when they tell me that?

01:05:53.235 --> 01:05:55.435
You gotta learn to live with it.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:58.835
Where've you been hiding this man?
This is one sexy man.

01:05:58.935 --> 01:06:03.135
- He's an animal. You know that?
- Faster than a speeding bullet.

01:06:07.135 --> 01:06:10.935
Yeah, but he got himself
a Mercedes and a yacht, all of that.

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:15.435
Mr. Benny Blanco says it's gonna be okay.

01:06:16.235 --> 01:06:18.735
He wants to send
a bottle of champagne over...

01:06:18.835 --> 01:06:22.034
...and he wants you to send Steffie over,
when you're ready.

01:06:24.334 --> 01:06:28.434
- Carlito, what should I do?
- No problem. Steffie's with Dave now.

01:06:29.134 --> 01:06:30.734
But Benny said...

01:06:31.534 --> 01:06:32.734
Fuck Benny!

01:06:37.634 --> 01:06:39.434
This is from Benny Blanco.

01:06:39.534 --> 01:06:40.634
Send it back!

01:06:41.634 --> 01:06:42.834
¡Vete! ¡Vete!

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.934
Please, you can't do this.

01:06:47.234 --> 01:06:51.234
- Benny spends a lot of money here.
- He's a nickel-bagger. Come on.

01:06:51.534 --> 01:06:55.233
What happened to you?
What are you acting like this for?

01:06:55.433 --> 01:06:59.833
It doesn't make sense you should hate
this guy. This guy is you 20 years ago.

01:07:00.133 --> 01:07:01.433
Never me.

01:07:06.933 --> 01:07:10.033
This is the second time
you turned me down for a drink.

01:07:10.133 --> 01:07:13.133
- You don't like my champagne?
- It could be.

01:07:14.733 --> 01:07:17.033
Maybe there's a mis-fucking-understanding.

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:20.433
- Maybe you don't remember me.
- Maybe I don't give a shit.

01:07:21.133 --> 01:07:24.433
Maybe I don't remember the last time
I blew my nose either.

01:07:24.433 --> 01:07:27.232
Who the fuck are you,
I should remember you?

01:07:27.732 --> 01:07:30.032
What, you think you're like me?

01:07:30.432 --> 01:07:33.432
You ain't like me, motherfucker.
You're a punk.

01:07:33.732 --> 01:07:36.732
I've been with made people,
connected people.

01:07:37.132 --> 01:07:38.832
Who you been with?

01:07:39.832 --> 01:07:44.032
Chain-snatchin', jive-ass,
maricón motherfuckers.

01:07:45.232 --> 01:07:49.132
Why don't you get lost? Go ahead,
snatch a purse. Take a fuckin' walk.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:52.832
The only problem here is that
Steffie doesn't know where she belongs.

01:07:52.832 --> 01:07:57.231
- Steffie belongs here.
- I think Steffie's makin' a big mistake!

01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:01.831
I'll blow your fucking head off.

01:08:05.931 --> 01:08:09.531
- I'll blow this cocksucker's head off.
- Put that fuckin' gun away!

01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:12.031
- How does it feel?
- Go! Go!

01:08:12.031 --> 01:08:13.731
How does it feel?

01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:19.131
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.331
What the fuck is this?

01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:27.831
Watch the floor!

01:08:28.831 --> 01:08:32.029
We've got a mis-fuckin'-communication
here, man!

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:37.529
Hold it! Stop him here.

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:42.330
Okay, Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:45.430
The chick Steffie belongs to the club.

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:51.229
If I ever see you here again...

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:53.330
...you die, just like that.

01:08:58.529 --> 01:09:02.229
You're over, man.
You're fuckin' in the history books.

01:09:02.328 --> 01:09:06.629
So you might as well kill me now, 'cause if
I ever see you again, I'm gonna kill you.

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:19.029
Get him out. Take him out the back.

01:09:23.929 --> 01:09:25.429
Take him in the alley.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:29.129
Dumb move, man. Dumb move.

01:09:29.629 --> 01:09:32.328
But it's like them old reflexes comin' back.

01:09:33.929 --> 01:09:36.428
I know what's supposed to happen now.

01:09:36.528 --> 01:09:38.127
Benny's gotta go down.

01:09:39.127 --> 01:09:41.828
And if I don't do it, they're gonna say:

01:09:42.127 --> 01:09:46.028
"Carlito, he's flaky, man. Slacked-out.

01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:50.528
"A used-to-be bad guy.
Joint got to Carlito."

01:09:51.627 --> 01:09:56.428
The street is watchin'.
She is watchin' all the time.

01:09:56.728 --> 01:09:58.428
Hold it, hold it!

01:10:02.528 --> 01:10:05.728
Let's put him in the trunk of the car
and drive him off the pier.

01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:09.427
- Fuck you, man.
- It ain't that far. Down the block.

01:10:10.727 --> 01:10:13.027
It'd be like the old days. Be fun.

01:10:16.827 --> 01:10:18.827
- Let him go.
- What?

01:10:19.127 --> 01:10:20.727
Let him go. Get him outta here.

01:10:20.827 --> 01:10:24.627
Any other time, that punk would die,
but I can't do that shit no more.

01:10:24.827 --> 01:10:27.927
Don't want to burn nobody,
even when I know I should.

01:10:28.027 --> 01:10:32.827
That ain't me now. All I want
is to get my $75,000 and get out.

01:10:33.327 --> 01:10:34.727
Just do it!

01:10:37.027 --> 01:10:40.126
Tell me he's in a fuckin' coffin.
What happened?

01:10:40.426 --> 01:10:44.426
Somethin' that shouldn't have happened.
Give me your piece, Dave.

01:10:45.026 --> 01:10:45.926
What?

01:10:46.026 --> 01:10:48.826
Give me the fuckin' gun.
Since when are you a tough guy?

01:10:49.926 --> 01:10:51.726
Get yourself killed.

01:10:53.726 --> 01:10:55.626
I can take care of myself.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:59.526
You think I'm some law school schmuck,
I never saw a bad guy before?

01:11:01.026 --> 01:11:04.626
You are gonna wave that thing
at the wrong guy...

01:11:04.726 --> 01:11:08.426
...he's gonna take it from you
and bury it up your ass, guaranteed.

01:11:08.826 --> 01:11:10.926
Now give me the gun. Come on.

01:11:20.225 --> 01:11:23.025
I know you love me, kid,
but you gotta lighten up.

01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:27.825
Listen...

01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:32.125
...I'm throwin' a big party
out at my summer house Saturday.

01:11:32.225 --> 01:11:35.125
I want you to come.
Something I wanna talk to you about.

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:39.225
Why can't you talk to me about it here?

01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:42.925
I'll tell you Saturday. I need visual aids.

01:12:25.023 --> 01:12:28.023
What's the matter with you,
pushing this guy in the pool...

01:12:28.123 --> 01:12:31.323
...your fucking friends knocking down
my rented tables?

01:12:58.922 --> 01:13:02.122
What you doing out here by yourself?

01:13:04.122 --> 01:13:04.922
Sittin'.

01:13:05.822 --> 01:13:07.722
You sure are weird, baby.

01:13:08.222 --> 01:13:10.522
How come you never try to fuck me?

01:13:10.622 --> 01:13:14.622
You got into a big beef for me,
and you ain't never laid a glove on me.

01:13:14.722 --> 01:13:18.722
- You're Dave's girl now.
- He can't fuck me, all the coke he's doin'.

01:13:19.922 --> 01:13:23.121
- What are you two talking about?
- Fucking.

01:13:23.421 --> 01:13:26.421
Speaking of fucking,
look at those fucking friends of yours.

01:13:26.421 --> 01:13:28.221
They're a fucking embarrassment.

01:13:28.221 --> 01:13:30.821
- Do something. Be a hostess.
- Fuck you, asshole!

01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:32.521
Yeah, fuck me.

01:13:33.021 --> 01:13:37.421
Your fuckin' chick's giving you
a hand-job in front of everybody!

01:13:37.521 --> 01:13:40.521
I got guests here, for Christ's sake!
People are eating!

01:13:40.821 --> 01:13:44.521
- Take it easy, Dave!
- You take it easy! Got any manners?

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:49.021
You wanna fuck her, fuck like a normal
human being! Take her to the bedroom!

01:13:51.721 --> 01:13:52.921
People!

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.620
Okay, Dave, what's up?

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.720
- I need you to do something for me.
- What is it?

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:14.320
You gotta help me spring Tony Taglialucci
from the prison barge at Rikers.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.020
Are you crazy?

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.820
He thinks I stole a million dollars from him.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.519
This is a dying man. He's nuts.
He's totally fucking paranoid.

01:14:36.119 --> 01:14:38.819
Do you realize what you just said to me?

01:14:39.819 --> 01:14:43.519
If I don't do it, he's going
to have me killed. It's that simple.

01:14:47.119 --> 01:14:50.119
So that means you're gonna
have to bust into prison?

01:14:51.319 --> 01:14:53.219
What do you think, I'm crazy?

01:14:54.419 --> 01:14:56.719
He's gonna swim off the island.

01:14:57.819 --> 01:14:59.618
- Gonna swim?
- Yeah.

01:15:01.218 --> 01:15:02.518
He's gonna drown.

01:15:05.218 --> 01:15:07.618
Not if you and I pick him up...

01:15:09.618 --> 01:15:10.618
...in that.

01:15:11.818 --> 01:15:14.818
Tony's got a guy on the inside
who'll get him in the water.

01:15:14.918 --> 01:15:17.918
I know these channels
like the back of my hand.

01:15:18.218 --> 01:15:22.018
We cross Little Neck Bay
into the north corner to pick him up.

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:25.518
There's a buoy about 100 yards offshore.
That's where he's gonna be.

01:15:25.618 --> 01:15:28.118
This is in and out, half hour tops.

01:15:29.518 --> 01:15:31.917
He's gonna jump off a barge...

01:15:32.817 --> 01:15:34.717
...swim 100 yards...

01:15:35.717 --> 01:15:38.017
...to a buoy in the East River?

01:15:38.517 --> 01:15:41.317
Impossible. It's too rough.
He's going to die.

01:15:41.417 --> 01:15:44.917
That's his fucking problem.
There's no point in arguing.

01:15:45.017 --> 01:15:49.317
I have to do this. I'm asking for your help.

01:15:52.117 --> 01:15:56.217
You're a lawyer, man.
What the fuck is happenin' to you?

01:16:00.917 --> 01:16:02.417
I don't know.

01:16:05.316 --> 01:16:09.616
I am so fucking shook up,
I cannot see straight.

01:16:10.616 --> 01:16:13.516
I'm in an impossible fucking situation here.

01:16:16.716 --> 01:16:19.016
Once I get Tony on the shore...

01:16:20.416 --> 01:16:24.316
...there is a distinct possibility
that he and his goombah son...

01:16:24.516 --> 01:16:26.616
...have got some plans for me.

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:31.116
What do you mean, "plans"?
What kind of plans?

01:16:33.216 --> 01:16:36.915
How do I know he's not gonna kill me?
This guy hates my guts.

01:16:40.215 --> 01:16:43.915
I'm in trouble. I am in fuckin' trouble here.

01:16:44.415 --> 01:16:47.415
You are the only fucking person on earth...

01:16:48.715 --> 01:16:50.315
...that I can trust.

01:16:55.115 --> 01:16:57.815
And I'll give you $50,000 to go along.

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.815
If I go along, it ain't for the money.

01:17:05.915 --> 01:17:07.315
Are you in?

01:17:10.214 --> 01:17:11.314
When is this...

01:17:11.314 --> 01:17:14.414
I don't know! His son's gonna call me.
Are you in?

01:17:20.914 --> 01:17:22.614
All right, I'm in.

01:17:26.414 --> 01:17:27.714
Thank you.

01:17:55.813 --> 01:17:56.913
Surprise.

01:18:00.313 --> 01:18:02.013
I was asleep.

01:18:06.413 --> 01:18:10.713
Can I come in?
I bought you some cheesecake.

01:18:13.013 --> 01:18:14.912
I don't like cheesecake.

01:18:15.712 --> 01:18:19.512
You wouldn't have buzzed me up,
if you wasn't gonna let me in.

01:18:22.312 --> 01:18:24.212
I'm saying no, Charlie.

01:18:29.712 --> 01:18:31.212
What can I do?

01:18:33.312 --> 01:18:35.212
What are you gonna do?

01:18:38.512 --> 01:18:40.112
Are you gonna...

01:18:41.512 --> 01:18:43.112
...bust the chain?

01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:48.311
Chase me around the apartment?

01:18:53.011 --> 01:18:54.511
Get me naked?

01:18:56.511 --> 01:18:58.411
Take me on the floor?

01:19:02.711 --> 01:19:06.011
- I'm too old for that.
- That's too bad.

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.811
If you can't get in...

01:19:14.011 --> 01:19:15.611
...you don't get in.

01:20:31.608 --> 01:20:33.508
Where's my cheesecake?

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:57.307
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:20:58.507 --> 01:20:59.807
Anything.

01:21:04.507 --> 01:21:06.507
Did you ever kill anybody?

01:21:11.707 --> 01:21:13.107
I'm sorry.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:22.407
Well, it's just not a simple question.

01:21:23.607 --> 01:21:26.307
- I just can't answer it like...
- That's all right.

01:21:26.407 --> 01:21:28.707
- You don't have to...
...there it is.

01:21:28.707 --> 01:21:30.706
You don't have to answer.

01:21:35.706 --> 01:21:38.106
When I was a kid in East Harlem...

01:21:40.206 --> 01:21:41.806
...the wops said...

01:21:43.006 --> 01:21:45.706
...no spics could go east of Park Avenue.

01:21:47.206 --> 01:21:50.606
Spooks said: "No 'Ricans
west of Fifth Avenue."

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:54.606
That don't leave you
much room to maneuver.

01:21:54.606 --> 01:21:58.806
Say you want to go to Central Park, play
with the ducks. You're shit outta luck.

01:21:59.006 --> 01:22:01.405
So what do you do? You go anyway.

01:22:02.005 --> 01:22:05.205
I'm up on 106th Street,
Central Park, near the lake.

01:22:06.205 --> 01:22:09.705
I get caught by these Copiens. Right?
They surround me.

01:22:10.205 --> 01:22:12.705
So I get my blood up, pull out my blade.

01:22:12.705 --> 01:22:15.505
I said: "Come on!
I'll take any one of you mothers!"

01:22:15.605 --> 01:22:20.205
They say: "No, man. We're gonna kill
your ass." Out come the zip guns.

01:22:21.605 --> 01:22:22.905
Homemade gun.

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:27.405
You pull the hook back,
catch that bullet square, ping.

01:22:27.605 --> 01:22:30.805
Hit you in the head, man,
you got serious problems.

01:22:31.305 --> 01:22:34.004
That was the last chase on me like that...

01:22:34.304 --> 01:22:37.104
...because from then on
I carried my own piece.

01:22:38.904 --> 01:22:42.704
Guys went down, yeah, but it ain't like,
you know, you just...

01:22:43.204 --> 01:22:45.904
...decide one day, and then that's it. No.

01:22:47.304 --> 01:22:50.904
You just do what you gotta do to survive.

01:22:51.904 --> 01:22:56.304
Somehow, you know,
you just end up where you are.

01:23:00.304 --> 01:23:02.804
That's how everybody ends up
where they are.

01:23:03.204 --> 01:23:04.504
Everybody.

01:23:06.603 --> 01:23:09.703
Only I'm gettin' out. I'm gonna rent cars.

01:23:12.803 --> 01:23:14.403
What're you laughing at?

01:23:14.803 --> 01:23:17.703
Everybody laughs at that. That's a dream.

01:23:18.103 --> 01:23:19.803
I know, I'm sorry.

01:23:20.003 --> 01:23:22.203
Didn't you ever have a dream?

01:23:22.403 --> 01:23:24.003
Of course I did.

01:23:25.803 --> 01:23:29.703
The Diamond Room isn't exactly
the end of my rainbow, you know.

01:23:29.903 --> 01:23:31.103
It's just...

01:23:33.203 --> 01:23:34.203
I don't know.

01:23:40.502 --> 01:23:42.902
Just sometimes I hear myself talk...

01:23:46.502 --> 01:23:52.102
...about new agents and auditions,
and I'm trying to be so optimistic.

01:23:57.002 --> 01:23:58.502
Then I think...

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:01.702
...why should I be so optimistic?

01:24:13.701 --> 01:24:15.501
Yeah, I had a dream...

01:24:18.201 --> 01:24:19.901
...but now I'm awake...

01:24:23.301 --> 01:24:25.101
...and I hate my dream.

01:24:36.001 --> 01:24:39.601
Maybe it's time I started thinking
about doing something else.

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.700
Maybe someplace else too.

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:58.200
Seems like every day I'm finding
something new I like about Gail.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.700
I keep workin' my points
about us gettin' out of New York...

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.000
...going to live in the Bahamas together,
permanent.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.200
She ain't sayin' much, but...

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.900
...I can tell the idea is growin' on her.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.499
Money's comin' in steady now. It won't
be much longer till I got what I need.

01:25:18.699 --> 01:25:21.899
This dream of mine, it's so close...

01:25:22.599 --> 01:25:24.199
...I can touch it.

01:25:27.599 --> 01:25:30.799
- Where you going? Wait, no.
- I'm tired.

01:25:31.199 --> 01:25:34.299
- I'm an old man. I need a rockin' chair.
- Come on! Please!

01:25:34.399 --> 01:25:37.499
Let me watch you.
I love to watch you. Go ahead.

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:39.199
There it is.

01:25:43.999 --> 01:25:45.299
I'm sorry!

01:25:47.699 --> 01:25:49.198
Look at that!

01:25:52.998 --> 01:25:55.298
Here's a bunch of us at the Copa.

01:25:55.898 --> 01:25:58.598
Everybody dancin', drinkin' Dom Perignon.

01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:02.298
Everything paid for by Kleinfeld.

01:26:03.498 --> 01:26:06.398
Won't even let you
put your hand in your pocket.

01:26:06.398 --> 01:26:08.898
Always sneakin' off, payin' the waiter.

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:13.498
But he has that bad drinker face.

01:26:14.798 --> 01:26:17.698
His eyes are gettin' beadier
and beadier these days.

01:26:18.498 --> 01:26:20.298
Should have seen it coming.

01:26:20.398 --> 01:26:22.997
Don't stop. Please don't stop.
Look at that move.

01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:37.397
You're gonna let this fuckin' goombah
paw your woman like that?

01:26:38.397 --> 01:26:40.097
They're just dancin'.

01:26:41.397 --> 01:26:44.397
Don't you appreciate that,
the movement, the rhythm?

01:26:44.397 --> 01:26:47.897
What I don't appreciate,
he's got his fucking hands all over her ass.

01:26:48.797 --> 01:26:51.097
He don't have his hands over her ass.

01:26:51.297 --> 01:26:53.497
I believe those are her hips.

01:26:55.796 --> 01:26:57.296
Look at the shithead.

01:26:58.196 --> 01:27:00.596
These wise guys think
they're so hard-assed.

01:27:00.796 --> 01:27:03.996
I am so sick of hoods like that...

01:27:04.796 --> 01:27:07.196
...coming into my office, my office...

01:27:08.096 --> 01:27:10.496
...thinkin' they can push me around.

01:27:13.596 --> 01:27:17.596
You should tell him what you think.
Why hold somethin' like that inside?

01:27:18.896 --> 01:27:21.196
Why not get something like that
off your chest?

01:27:21.296 --> 01:27:23.796
- It's a terrible thing to carry around.
- I will.

01:27:23.896 --> 01:27:25.796
- I think you should.
- I will.

01:27:26.395 --> 01:27:29.795
See how interested
he's gonna be in your comments.

01:27:35.095 --> 01:27:36.295
What're you doin'?

01:27:36.395 --> 01:27:38.595
- Are you outta your mind?
- What's that?

01:27:38.695 --> 01:27:42.295
- Yeah, you, wop.
- Me?

01:27:42.495 --> 01:27:44.795
- You, spaghetti-dick.
- Wait. Okay, okay.

01:27:44.995 --> 01:27:47.795
- I'm talking to you. Yeah, you.
- You're talkin' to me?

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:50.995
- Just ignore him. He's drunk.
- What'd he say?

01:27:52.295 --> 01:27:53.595
Sit down!

01:27:55.595 --> 01:27:57.895
- Who does he think he is?
- No problem.

01:27:57.895 --> 01:28:01.294
Come on. Let's have a drink.
Come on, everybody.

01:28:01.794 --> 01:28:05.194
- Can you believe this loser?
- Let's go back to the table.

01:28:05.394 --> 01:28:08.294
- People have no sense of humor.
- Let's go.

01:28:08.694 --> 01:28:12.194
I was just fooling around.
I'd never let anything happen.

01:28:12.294 --> 01:28:15.794
Carlito and me, we take care of each other.
He knows. Right, kid?

01:28:15.894 --> 01:28:17.094
Come on.

01:28:18.694 --> 01:28:20.694
You're a beautiful woman.

01:28:22.994 --> 01:28:25.994
You don't get seasick on boats, do you?

01:28:29.394 --> 01:28:31.193
- No, I don't.
- Good.

01:28:32.993 --> 01:28:35.893
Just asking 'cause of our little boat trip
tomorrow night.

01:28:35.993 --> 01:28:37.193
Just drop it.

01:28:37.293 --> 01:28:41.293
Just tryin' to cover all the bases.
It's comin' up, you know.

01:28:45.993 --> 01:28:47.993
You two going somewhere?

01:28:49.693 --> 01:28:51.693
No big deal. Just a little boat ride.

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:55.293
Why don't you just let it go?
It's dull what you're doin'.

01:28:55.393 --> 01:28:57.693
- What's the problem?
- It's just fuckin' dull.

01:28:57.693 --> 01:29:01.093
I'm just askin' a simple question.
What's the matter?

01:29:01.293 --> 01:29:02.993
You're actin' like an asshole.

01:29:02.993 --> 01:29:07.592
If a guy's goin' on a boat, you wanna know
if he gets seasick. It could be important.

01:29:07.692 --> 01:29:09.092
What boat?

01:29:12.392 --> 01:29:14.792
What boat are you talking about?

01:29:21.592 --> 01:29:23.392
What boat, Charlie?

01:29:38.191 --> 01:29:42.791
If you ever talk that shit again
in front of her, I'm gonna kill you.

01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:50.291
What's the matter with him?

01:29:53.391 --> 01:29:55.091
I don't like him.

01:29:55.691 --> 01:29:59.691
- Didn't like him the minute I met him.
- You're just not listenin' to me.

01:30:02.391 --> 01:30:03.691
All right.

01:30:04.991 --> 01:30:07.391
So what is this boat thing then?

01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:11.690
What is that asshole
manipulating you into? Tell me.

01:30:11.690 --> 01:30:15.090
Just helpin' him out with something,
that's all. I owe him.

01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:16.690
You owe him?

01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:19.790
He's a fucking cokehead!

01:30:21.090 --> 01:30:23.890
I can't believe you hang around
with that guy.

01:30:25.190 --> 01:30:26.190
He's sick.

01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:29.590
He's gonna get you killed,
or sent back to prison.

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.490
He saved my life!

01:30:33.190 --> 01:30:35.690
So now you have to pay him with it?

01:30:37.690 --> 01:30:41.089
Jesus Christ, Charlie,
you give me this whole song and dance...

01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:44.389
...about how you're out of that shit,
but you're not.

01:30:44.589 --> 01:30:47.389
Song and dance? What does that mean,
"song and dance"?

01:30:48.089 --> 01:30:49.489
You're not.

01:30:50.289 --> 01:30:52.689
Where'd you get that? From what?

01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:58.589
- Why'd you drag me into this?
- Drag you into what?

01:30:58.789 --> 01:31:02.289
Why'd you make me believe all the crap
about Bahamas and paradise?

01:31:04.489 --> 01:31:06.189
I feel ridiculous!

01:31:07.589 --> 01:31:09.289
'Cause you haven't changed!

01:31:09.989 --> 01:31:11.889
You haven't changed a bit!

01:31:17.088 --> 01:31:19.788
What the fuck are you tryin' to tell me?

01:31:19.888 --> 01:31:24.088
That my gettin' out is just some bullshit
fantasy trip I'm layin' on you?

01:31:24.388 --> 01:31:26.988
Is that what you're sayin'?
How could you say that?

01:31:27.088 --> 01:31:30.388
How can you say that
when you know how close I am?

01:31:31.288 --> 01:31:33.988
How could you say those words to me?

01:31:35.188 --> 01:31:38.588
I gotta do this, just this one thing,
and then I'm out.

01:31:38.688 --> 01:31:41.288
- I owe Dave.
- You don't owe him shit!

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:43.988
You think you do. That's the problem.

01:31:43.988 --> 01:31:47.387
- That's why nobody like you gets out.
- You're not listening.

01:31:47.587 --> 01:31:51.187
Everything you learned
in the neighborhood...

01:31:51.287 --> 01:31:53.487
...won't do anything but get you killed!

01:31:53.987 --> 01:31:56.987
How do you know what I learned
in my neighborhood?

01:31:57.487 --> 01:31:59.387
This is stupid what you say.

01:31:59.587 --> 01:32:01.687
I know how this dream ends.

01:32:03.387 --> 01:32:05.187
It isn't in paradise.

01:32:06.987 --> 01:32:11.687
It ends with me carrying you
into Sutton Emergency Room...

01:32:12.487 --> 01:32:14.487
...at 3:00 a.m.

01:32:17.087 --> 01:32:18.886
And standing there...

01:32:19.886 --> 01:32:21.686
...crying like an idiot...

01:32:24.286 --> 01:32:27.186
...while your shoes fill with blood
and you die.

01:32:27.286 --> 01:32:31.986
- You won't listen to me...
- 'Cause you're bullshitting me!

01:32:32.386 --> 01:32:34.986
You're not listening to me!

01:32:47.986 --> 01:32:50.186
Dave is my friend.

01:32:52.485 --> 01:32:53.785
I owe him.

01:32:55.185 --> 01:32:56.185
That's...

01:32:57.685 --> 01:32:58.985
...who I am.

01:33:00.385 --> 01:33:02.885
That's what I am, right or wrong.

01:33:05.585 --> 01:33:07.385
I can't change that!

01:33:20.085 --> 01:33:22.185
Whatever he wants you to do...

01:33:24.784 --> 01:33:26.184
...don't do it.

01:33:27.884 --> 01:33:29.984
For me, please, don't do it.

01:33:32.084 --> 01:33:33.284
Please.

01:33:33.984 --> 01:33:36.484
Just don't do it.

01:33:42.484 --> 01:33:45.284
That's the last time I wipe up your blood!

01:33:49.584 --> 01:33:52.884
Came the big night,
and right away I didn't like it.

01:33:53.284 --> 01:33:55.783
Kleinfeld was coked out of his mind...

01:33:56.583 --> 01:33:59.383
...the flaps of his nose, all red and swollen.

01:34:00.283 --> 01:34:01.883
Bad start, Jack.

01:34:05.183 --> 01:34:09.183
- What's with the extra guy?
- This is one of Tony's sons, Frankie.

01:34:09.183 --> 01:34:10.683
- It's Frank.
- Whatever.

01:34:10.683 --> 01:34:14.083
- What is with the extra guy?
- Excuse me, is this your boat?

01:34:14.383 --> 01:34:17.483
Then shut the fuck up.
I thought I needed help, I brought help.

01:34:17.583 --> 01:34:19.983
We'll take the La Guardia side
through the Sound.

01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:24.183
Take the wheel when we pick up Tony.
Carlito, you help me fish him out.

01:34:24.283 --> 01:34:26.883
- It's Frank.
- Whatever. Cast her off.

01:34:28.082 --> 01:34:31.582
- What's that?
- Untie the fuckin' rope, spic! Come on!

01:34:47.382 --> 01:34:49.482
This guy a friend of yours?

01:34:51.182 --> 01:34:53.082
Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

01:34:53.182 --> 01:34:55.182
He's a fucking cockroach.

01:35:14.681 --> 01:35:16.881
All right now, take it easy.

01:35:17.681 --> 01:35:18.881
I see the buoy.

01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:21.581
You see it? Where?

01:35:24.381 --> 01:35:26.881
Slow. I can't see a fuckin' thing.

01:35:27.381 --> 01:35:30.381
- It's right there.
- Did you hear what I just said?

01:35:30.481 --> 01:35:33.080
Would you slow down?
You're gonna run him over.

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:38.380
Where you goin'?

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:42.580
Jesus, fuck, you passed him! You idiot!

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.180
Frankie boy, hold on.
You come up on the fly deck with me.

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.180
We can't back it up from down here.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:49.580
Up here! Come on!

01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:52.080
Come on, follow me. This way.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.080
Help!

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:00.680
Come here! Come back!

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:06.579
Get outta the fuckin' way!
I can't see a goddamn thing.

01:36:12.879 --> 01:36:14.179
Over here!

01:36:16.679 --> 01:36:18.779
You missed me! Over here!

01:36:30.079 --> 01:36:32.279
You see that light right there?

01:36:33.279 --> 01:36:34.679
Yeah, the light.

01:36:34.779 --> 01:36:37.479
Just keep the bow pointed
straight at that light.

01:36:37.579 --> 01:36:40.278
- Can you manage that?
- I got the light.

01:36:44.478 --> 01:36:45.678
Here!

01:36:46.378 --> 01:36:48.278
- Come on.
- Over here.

01:36:50.078 --> 01:36:51.078
Help!

01:36:53.878 --> 01:36:56.078
Okay, got him! Stop it!

01:36:56.478 --> 01:36:58.178
I got him! Stop it!

01:36:59.678 --> 01:37:01.478
- Hurry up!
- Okay, come on.

01:37:03.878 --> 01:37:04.678
Help me!

01:37:04.778 --> 01:37:06.878
- You got him?
- I got him.

01:37:07.278 --> 01:37:11.577
Take the wheel. We're starting to turn.
I got him. Tony, grab a rail!

01:37:14.177 --> 01:37:15.477
Help me!

01:37:17.377 --> 01:37:18.677
Help me.

01:37:21.177 --> 01:37:23.377
You tell me how it feels...

01:37:23.477 --> 01:37:27.377
...with the fuckin' eels
and the fuckin' crabs...

01:37:27.577 --> 01:37:30.177
...comin' outta your fuckin' eyes!

01:37:32.677 --> 01:37:34.677
What the fuck you doin'?

01:37:38.677 --> 01:37:42.177
- Now, drown, you guinea bastard!
- Get the fuck off!

01:37:43.076 --> 01:37:44.476
Help me get Frankie.

01:37:45.076 --> 01:37:47.576
You killed us, Dave. You killed us.

01:37:49.776 --> 01:37:50.976
My God.

01:37:59.576 --> 01:38:01.176
Come on, Frankie.

01:38:03.176 --> 01:38:05.676
Your daddy's waitin' for ya.

01:38:08.376 --> 01:38:09.376
Come on!

01:38:09.876 --> 01:38:12.976
Take an end, for Christ's sake.
We're fallin' out of position.

01:38:13.676 --> 01:38:16.575
We're gonna stand you up
and say good night.

01:38:20.975 --> 01:38:22.475
Get him on the other side.

01:38:22.675 --> 01:38:26.275
One, two, three.

01:38:42.575 --> 01:38:46.075
There's a line you cross
you don't never come back from.

01:38:47.874 --> 01:38:49.574
Point of no return.

01:38:50.674 --> 01:38:54.574
Dave crossed it. I'm here with him.

01:38:55.374 --> 01:38:58.974
That means I'm goin' along for the ride,
the whole ride...

01:38:59.274 --> 01:39:02.674
...all the way to the end of the line,
wherever that is.

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:09.774
I had to do it.
He never would've let me live.

01:39:11.174 --> 01:39:14.274
I know, you're pissed.
I'm gonna throw in another $10,000.

01:39:14.274 --> 01:39:18.174
I'm gonna send over the whole $60,000
in cash tomorrow. All right?

01:39:18.874 --> 01:39:23.373
It's gonna look like the kid tried to spring
the old man, boat flipped, they drowned.

01:39:23.373 --> 01:39:27.873
Maybe they got their heads split
by a scow or barge just for good measure.

01:39:28.073 --> 01:39:30.773
This is never gonna come back to us.
Trust me.

01:39:30.973 --> 01:39:33.273
- You ripped him off, didn't you?
- Who?

01:39:33.673 --> 01:39:37.173
Tony T. You did take the million dollars,
didn't you?

01:39:43.073 --> 01:39:44.273
Yeah.

01:39:49.673 --> 01:39:53.172
You ain't a lawyer no more, Dave.
You're a gangster now.

01:39:54.072 --> 01:39:57.272
You're on the other side.
Whole new ball game.

01:39:59.072 --> 01:40:03.972
You can't learn about it in school,
and you can't have a late start.

01:40:05.372 --> 01:40:07.172
Don't worry about me.

01:40:07.772 --> 01:40:09.372
One more thing.

01:40:10.972 --> 01:40:12.372
We're even.

01:40:14.272 --> 01:40:15.872
- Let's get a drink.
- Say it!

01:40:18.972 --> 01:40:20.372
We're even.

01:40:23.472 --> 01:40:24.772
We're even.

01:40:32.771 --> 01:40:35.071
We ain't never gonna sell these tickets...

01:40:35.971 --> 01:40:38.071
...whackin' a boss and his kid.

01:40:40.871 --> 01:40:43.771
These Italians, I work with 'em, I know 'em.

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:47.471
They will read this one
with their eyes closed.

01:40:48.771 --> 01:40:50.571
I gotta keep movin'.

01:41:33.869 --> 01:41:35.369
Most people will.

01:41:42.069 --> 01:41:43.369
You get old enough...

01:41:43.469 --> 01:41:46.769
...you remember a reason
why everybody wants to whack you.

01:41:46.969 --> 01:41:48.769
You believe 'em all...

01:41:50.269 --> 01:41:52.969
...but you know somebody's gotta be lyin'.

01:41:54.569 --> 01:41:56.769
Or maybe they're all lyin'.

01:41:58.769 --> 01:42:03.268
When you can't see the angles no more,
you're in trouble, baby.

01:42:04.468 --> 01:42:05.668
You're in trouble.

01:42:11.268 --> 01:42:14.068
There's a Patrolman Williams on the line.

01:42:15.668 --> 01:42:17.068
Put him on.

01:42:18.668 --> 01:42:23.268
Mr. Kleinfeld? This is Patrolman Williams.
We're down here at your garage.

01:42:24.068 --> 01:42:26.668
Your license plate is DK 777?

01:42:26.968 --> 01:42:28.768
Yeah. Is there a problem?

01:42:28.868 --> 01:42:32.668
Somebody tried to steal your Mercedes.
There was an accident.

01:42:32.968 --> 01:42:34.968
- There was an accident?
- Yeah.

01:42:35.067 --> 01:42:37.767
- Is it badly damaged?
- I'm afraid so.

01:42:37.767 --> 01:42:39.667
I'll be right down.

01:42:48.967 --> 01:42:51.167
I'll be ten minutes. Come on.

01:44:07.565 --> 01:44:10.265
Mr. Taglialucci says to hold that for him!

01:44:25.764 --> 01:44:26.964
Wait up.

01:44:27.764 --> 01:44:30.464
I can't talk. I have an appointment.

01:44:31.364 --> 01:44:35.464
You were right about Kleinfeld.
He's a bad guy.

01:44:36.064 --> 01:44:40.064
- Me and him are finished.
- I can't talk. I'll call you, okay?

01:44:40.064 --> 01:44:42.064
Slow down. What is it?

01:44:42.964 --> 01:44:45.663
- Am I on the outs with you? Is that it?
- Yeah.

01:44:45.763 --> 01:44:48.063
That's crazy. What's wrong with you?

01:44:48.163 --> 01:44:50.863
I have a lot on my mind.
Can we please talk later?

01:44:51.063 --> 01:44:54.663
I just wanted you to know
you were right about Kleinfeld.

01:44:55.163 --> 01:44:57.963
- I'm sorry if you're upset.
- I gotta go.

01:44:58.063 --> 01:44:59.663
I have a doctor's appointment.

01:44:59.763 --> 01:45:02.763
- What's the matter? You sick?
- No, I'm late.

01:45:03.463 --> 01:45:08.363
- We'll take a cab. What's wrong?
- No, Charlie, I'm late! I'm late!

01:45:11.263 --> 01:45:13.963
- You mean you...
- Not for long, okay?

01:45:15.863 --> 01:45:17.362
What does that mean?

01:45:17.462 --> 01:45:20.362
I'm not gonna have a kid
who's not gonna have a father.

01:45:21.162 --> 01:45:23.162
We gotta talk about this.

01:45:25.262 --> 01:45:27.962
- Mr. Brigante, my name is Duncan.
- Oh, my God.

01:45:28.062 --> 01:45:31.862
I'm here to escort you to Mr. Norwalk
in the District Attorney's office.

01:45:32.362 --> 01:45:35.562
I got nothin' to say to him
unless I'm under arrest.

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:38.962
Mr. Norwalk has a tape
he'd like to play for you.

01:45:39.962 --> 01:45:44.662
Unless I'm under arrest, I ain't goin'
anywhere, especially without my lawyer.

01:45:45.562 --> 01:45:49.362
Mr. Kleinfeld took a knife in the chest
at 2:00 this afternoon.

01:45:52.561 --> 01:45:54.761
I advise you to come with us.

01:45:55.561 --> 01:45:58.161
We may be the only friends you've got.

01:46:00.161 --> 01:46:01.661
I'm going, too.

01:46:02.861 --> 01:46:05.061
Kleinfeld's lucky to be alive.

01:46:05.861 --> 01:46:07.961
We're holding him at East Side Hospital.

01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:10.961
We want his ass healthy
when we send it upstate.

01:46:11.561 --> 01:46:14.361
You're sendin' him upstate? What for?

01:46:16.261 --> 01:46:19.961
David Kleinfeld became a very big fish
while you were gone.

01:46:21.461 --> 01:46:23.460
Even bigger than you. He's dirty.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:28.160
Money laundering, jury tampering, bribery.
We've been after him for some time now.

01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:31.760
I don't know nothin' about that, so...

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.360
There's a lot you don't know.

01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:40.660
Bill, you got no case here.
You know it and I know it.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.960
Chances are, you won't even
get an indictment.

01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:44.860
Wanna try your luck?

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:49.960
Look, let's not both waste our time.
You said maybe I could help myself.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:54.060
- You're not taping this, are you?
- Gimme a little credit.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:57.259
All right. I thought of something
you might want.

01:46:58.259 --> 01:47:01.659
You get off me, I'll help you put
Carlito Brigante back inside.

01:47:01.759 --> 01:47:03.659
Brigante? For what?

01:47:04.959 --> 01:47:09.759
After he got out, he started coming to
my office and making a lot of phone calls.

01:47:09.859 --> 01:47:14.759
I found out he was back with Rolando
Rivas, his old partner, dealin' coke.

01:47:15.759 --> 01:47:17.659
And I'm talkin' serious numbers.

01:47:18.359 --> 01:47:20.359
Would you testify to that?

01:47:21.359 --> 01:47:22.759
Absolutely.

01:47:27.758 --> 01:47:29.258
We don't believe him.

01:47:32.658 --> 01:47:37.458
Word on the street is you've been clean
since you came out of prison.

01:47:38.558 --> 01:47:40.658
Kleinfeld's the one we're after.

01:47:41.258 --> 01:47:45.258
He was right. I'd never get
an indictment with what I had.

01:47:45.958 --> 01:47:47.958
But now, with your help...

01:47:48.958 --> 01:47:51.858
...we can put this filth away
for a long time.

01:47:56.258 --> 01:47:57.258
Hermano...

01:47:59.058 --> 01:48:01.157
...we know about Tony T.

01:48:01.857 --> 01:48:03.357
Who's Tony T.?

01:48:03.957 --> 01:48:05.357
Yeah, right.

01:48:06.157 --> 01:48:10.657
His body popped up in the East River
yesterday, and his kid, Frankie's.

01:48:11.657 --> 01:48:14.657
Somebody was trying
to bust Tony outta prison.

01:48:15.357 --> 01:48:19.057
I don't know these people you mentioned.
I don't know them.

01:48:20.657 --> 01:48:23.957
Tony T. Had another son
besides Frankie, Vincent.

01:48:24.957 --> 01:48:27.757
Seems Vincent went crazy
after those bodies popped up.

01:48:27.957 --> 01:48:31.557
Let it out all over the street
that Kleinfeld set up that prison break...

01:48:31.657 --> 01:48:33.956
...then killed his father and his brother.

01:48:34.656 --> 01:48:37.056
We aren't saying you were
on that boat too.

01:48:38.056 --> 01:48:42.056
But knowing your relationship
with Kleinfeld, that's a good possibility.

01:48:42.156 --> 01:48:44.256
Don't you think, hermano?

01:48:45.356 --> 01:48:47.056
I don't like boats.

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:51.856
All right, here's the deal.

01:48:52.156 --> 01:48:55.256
If you were on that boat,
and I know goddamn well you were...

01:48:55.856 --> 01:48:59.056
...testify against Kleinfeld
for first-degree murder.

01:49:01.056 --> 01:49:04.955
You'll receive complete immunity and
a couple airline tickets to the Bahamas.

01:49:04.955 --> 01:49:08.555
You wanna get even with Kleinfeld?
Here it is on a silver platter.

01:49:09.355 --> 01:49:13.555
I would love to help you, but I can't.
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:49:13.655 --> 01:49:16.755
I don't know these people.
I don't know what you're sayin'...

01:49:17.055 --> 01:49:20.555
Let me tell you somethin',
Mr. Convicted Dope Peddler...

01:49:20.655 --> 01:49:24.555
...if we can guess you were on that boat,
how long before the Italians do, too?

01:49:24.655 --> 01:49:27.455
What if they get to Kleinfeld?
They can twist his arm.

01:49:27.555 --> 01:49:29.855
You think he won't give you up?
Think again!

01:49:29.955 --> 01:49:32.755
You don't owe Kleinfeld nothing.

01:49:33.155 --> 01:49:36.755
The shyster tried to set you up.
Bury you, Jack.

01:49:42.554 --> 01:49:43.854
That it?

01:49:49.754 --> 01:49:52.254
I wanna hear from you by noon tomorrow.

01:49:52.354 --> 01:49:56.054
You think you're gonna sail off
into the sunset, asshole?

01:49:56.754 --> 01:49:58.154
Think again.

01:50:03.654 --> 01:50:07.854
You gotta do it.
They're giving you no choice.

01:50:08.754 --> 01:50:10.653
You want out, go ahead.

01:50:10.753 --> 01:50:13.653
You can turn around,
walk away, never look back.

01:50:13.753 --> 01:50:16.453
I would understand. But I got a plan.

01:50:17.053 --> 01:50:20.053
I got a way outta this.
Pull over here, please.

01:50:20.453 --> 01:50:23.353
- What's going on?
- Just wait five minutes.

01:50:25.753 --> 01:50:28.853
- Where are you going?
- Wait here five minutes.

01:51:23.451 --> 01:51:24.951
What is that?

01:51:25.151 --> 01:51:28.351
Tickets on an overnight train to Miami.

01:51:29.651 --> 01:51:31.851
Nobody's gonna look for us on the train.

01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:35.151
We hit Miami, we catch a plane to Nassau.

01:51:36.751 --> 01:51:39.351
- What about the club? Your money?
- Fuck the club.

01:51:39.451 --> 01:51:44.351
I already got $70,000 in a safe. My friend
in the islands can float us the rest.

01:51:45.051 --> 01:51:48.450
Let's do it. Let's get outta here.

01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:51.050
All three of us.

01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:55.750
We're runnin' out of time, babe.

01:51:56.050 --> 01:52:00.250
The dream don't come no closer by itself.
We gotta run after it now.

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:08.050
I know, it's not the way I planned it either,
but it is how it is.

01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:13.450
I'm gonna go to the club, get my money,
and I'm goin' straight to Grand Central.

01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:17.650
Train leaves 11:30 for Miami.
You're gonna be there, Gail?

01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:21.049
- You'll be there?
- I'll be there.

01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:23.049
I love you.

01:52:26.449 --> 01:52:29.449
- Just make sure you're there.
- I'll see you later.

01:52:33.249 --> 01:52:37.149
Train leaves in five hours,
and I'm angling like crazy in my head.

01:52:37.649 --> 01:52:42.849
Norwalk'll blow over. He won't come out
of the country if he can't bust me here.

01:52:43.549 --> 01:52:45.749
But he ain't my only problem.

01:52:46.249 --> 01:52:49.049
Five hours left. Can I think of everything?

01:52:49.149 --> 01:52:52.048
Cover everybody. Tie all the shoelaces.

01:52:54.348 --> 01:52:56.248
Gotta listen to my instincts...

01:52:56.348 --> 01:53:00.148
...like the one tellin' me that face
and that uniform don't go together.

01:53:03.348 --> 01:53:07.248
Just one last piece of business.
Gotta look in Kleinfeld's eyes.

01:53:07.748 --> 01:53:09.548
Gotta know for sure.

01:53:18.248 --> 01:53:19.548
Who are you?

01:53:19.648 --> 01:53:22.848
- Kleinfeld is my lawyer.
- Hands on the wall.

01:53:29.347 --> 01:53:30.547
Go ahead.

01:53:37.847 --> 01:53:38.847
Relax.

01:53:40.447 --> 01:53:41.947
It's your pal.

01:53:43.547 --> 01:53:45.547
Scared the hell out of me.

01:53:46.647 --> 01:53:50.647
Cop's not supposed to let anybody in.
It's you, it's okay, but...

01:53:50.947 --> 01:53:53.147
Cops ain't gonna protect you.

01:53:54.347 --> 01:53:56.247
The mob is looking for you.

01:53:57.246 --> 01:53:59.746
I know. Where the fuck have you been?

01:53:59.746 --> 01:54:01.346
What do you got here?

01:54:05.746 --> 01:54:07.846
- Where you been?
- How do you feel?

01:54:07.846 --> 01:54:11.346
I'm not feeling very well.
Where the fuck have you been?

01:54:17.046 --> 01:54:19.046
I've been to Norwalk's office.

01:54:20.346 --> 01:54:21.646
I heard the tape.

01:54:23.946 --> 01:54:25.146
That pig.

01:54:26.546 --> 01:54:29.445
Never give up your friends,
no matter what.

01:54:31.145 --> 01:54:34.245
They doctor these things,
play 'em outta context.

01:54:34.545 --> 01:54:36.245
I can't believe you are such a...

01:54:36.545 --> 01:54:38.645
Don't fuckin' do that! Fuck you!

01:54:40.245 --> 01:54:42.345
What the fuck are you doing?

01:54:43.545 --> 01:54:46.345
Would you fuckin' put that away?
It's loaded!

01:54:50.645 --> 01:54:54.945
Fuck you and your self-righteous code
of the goddamned street.

01:54:56.445 --> 01:55:00.845
Did it pull you out of a thirty-year stint
in five years? Did it? No, I did.

01:55:02.144 --> 01:55:05.544
Did it get you acquitted four fucking times?
No, it didn't. I did.

01:55:05.644 --> 01:55:08.944
So fuck you, fuck the street.
Your whole goddamn world's this big...

01:55:09.044 --> 01:55:12.044
...and there's only one rule:
You save your own ass.

01:55:18.044 --> 01:55:19.744
Save your own ass.

01:55:21.044 --> 01:55:25.344
- Save your own ass.
- See this? It belongs here.

01:55:25.944 --> 01:55:29.544
Not behind a pillow.
This way you can reach for it quick.

01:55:30.344 --> 01:55:32.644
They come in, you ready for 'em.

01:55:34.843 --> 01:55:38.343
So long. You got a beautiful future.

01:56:16.842 --> 01:56:18.342
Quittin' time.

01:56:18.442 --> 01:56:21.542
- You're early.
- A few minutes. Finish your paper?

01:56:21.642 --> 01:56:23.642
- It's all yours.
- Thanks.

01:56:25.042 --> 01:56:26.242
Be good.

01:56:41.441 --> 01:56:43.941
There's a delivery for you, Mr. Kleinfeld.

01:56:44.641 --> 01:56:47.541
- From who?
- From my father...

01:56:48.541 --> 01:56:50.041
...and my brother.

01:56:53.341 --> 01:56:54.941
Adiós, counselor.

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:16.240
Where the hell you been?
You know somebody tried to kill Kleinfeld?

01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:20.640
I heard about it. Listen, me and Gail
are goin' out of town for a couple days.

01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:23.540
- You're gonna get married.
- Listen to me.

01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:28.140
I want you to go to Gail's house,
pick her up, drive her to Grand Central.

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:31.040
I want you to wait with her there for me.

01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:35.240
Train leaves 11:30 sharp.
We can't miss this train, understand?

01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:37.440
You got me? Go ahead.

01:57:58.839 --> 01:58:00.739
It's me, Pete Amadesso.

01:58:00.839 --> 01:58:04.239
- Remember me?
- How ya doin'?

01:58:04.839 --> 01:58:06.739
- Good.
- What're you doin' here?

01:58:06.939 --> 01:58:10.839
We heard this was your joint.
Nice! Come by to say "hello."

01:58:10.939 --> 01:58:13.339
Good to see you. How you doin'?

01:58:13.439 --> 01:58:15.939
- Good to see you. Yeah, long time.
- Long time.

01:58:16.039 --> 01:58:17.838
Sit down. Have a drink with us.

01:58:17.938 --> 01:58:20.138
Come on. Sit down.

01:58:22.638 --> 01:58:26.438
I said: "Shit, I ain't seen Carlito
in what, fifteen years?"

01:58:26.938 --> 01:58:28.938
Fifteen. Yeah, gotta be. Sure.

01:58:28.938 --> 01:58:30.938
- Long time.
- Long fuckin' time.

01:58:31.238 --> 01:58:34.438
- Sorry. Joe Battaglia.
- My pleasure. Good to see you.

01:58:34.538 --> 01:58:36.038
Sonny Manzanero.

01:58:36.538 --> 01:58:38.538
- How ya doin'?
- Carlito Brigante.

01:58:39.938 --> 01:58:43.538
Me and Carlito used to push
a little skag back in '57, '58.

01:58:43.838 --> 01:58:45.538
Couple of fuckin' kids.

01:58:46.038 --> 01:58:49.037
First time I saw this guy,
I thought he was Italian!

01:58:50.637 --> 01:58:51.637
Look at him!

01:58:51.737 --> 01:58:53.137
Shit!

01:58:54.037 --> 01:58:57.237
Pete Amadesso walks into my club
just like that.

01:58:57.837 --> 01:58:58.937
Bullshit.

01:58:59.037 --> 01:59:01.837
There's an angle here. Pete's a made guy.

01:59:01.937 --> 01:59:04.937
His uncle's a heavy hitter
with the Pleasant Avenue bunch.

01:59:05.037 --> 01:59:08.837
What's he doin' here?
Probably Tony T.'s people sent him.

01:59:10.237 --> 01:59:13.237
Maybe he's watchin' me, seein' if I break.

01:59:14.537 --> 01:59:16.537
Waitin' for me to panic.

01:59:18.237 --> 01:59:21.237
They still don't know for sure
if I was on that boat.

01:59:21.337 --> 01:59:23.736
They think, but they don't know.

01:59:24.636 --> 01:59:28.136
'Cause if they knew, I'd already be dead.

01:59:29.636 --> 01:59:33.036
Right now, they just watchin' me.

01:59:33.536 --> 01:59:37.236
He was always one of us.
That was a guy. That's who he is.

01:59:37.736 --> 01:59:39.436
And we gotta know that.

01:59:39.936 --> 01:59:41.936
So anyway, so I says to the guy:

01:59:42.736 --> 01:59:46.736
"Tommy, Carlito ain't no fuckin' nigger.
Look at the way he dances!"

01:59:49.136 --> 01:59:51.236
He dances like an Italian!

01:59:52.436 --> 01:59:57.035
You should see him do the tarantella!
Waiter, get over here.

01:59:58.135 --> 02:00:01.635
Bring these guys the best champagne
we got on the house.

02:00:02.035 --> 02:00:04.835
- Where you goin'? Stay with us.
- I'm a workin' man.

02:00:04.935 --> 02:00:07.535
Let me do what I gotta do.
I'll be right back.

02:00:07.635 --> 02:00:08.635
Okay, buddy.

02:00:46.434 --> 02:00:47.634
Motherfucker!

02:00:51.634 --> 02:00:52.634
Fuck.

02:01:03.633 --> 02:01:04.933
You seen the guy?

02:01:08.133 --> 02:01:09.233
Saso.

02:01:52.332 --> 02:01:54.632
- Where's my money?
- What're you talking about?

02:01:54.732 --> 02:01:56.232
- Where's my money?
- I don't know.

02:01:56.232 --> 02:01:59.832
You heard Kleinfeld got whacked,
so you figured I was dead, too!

02:02:00.032 --> 02:02:03.432
- You thought you inherited my money?
- I swear...

02:02:03.532 --> 02:02:06.531
Where's my money?
I'll cut your fuckin' liver out!

02:02:06.731 --> 02:02:08.031
Okay. Okay.

02:02:08.731 --> 02:02:12.331
It's in the box, under the register.
I was gonna tell you.

02:02:19.631 --> 02:02:21.931
I want you to meet a good friend of mine.

02:02:27.431 --> 02:02:30.431
You ever hear of Vinnie's father,
Tony Taglialucci?

02:02:32.231 --> 02:02:35.131
Tony T. Yeah, he passed away recently.
Sorry about that.

02:02:35.631 --> 02:02:38.230
I hear your Jew lawyer
met with an accident.

02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:41.030
I haven't seen him lately. What is this?

02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:45.530
I told you bring the best out,
you bring me this cheap shit?

02:02:45.530 --> 02:02:46.830
Come on. Excuse me.

02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:52.330
- Vinnie, slow down.
- "Ain't seen him lately!" The lyin' fuck!

02:02:52.330 --> 02:02:56.130
- Seen him in the hospital!
- We'll take him outside. Sit down.

02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:05.630
Relax, we'll get him.

02:03:42.828 --> 02:03:44.728
Where the hell is he?

02:03:55.328 --> 02:03:58.828
- The little fuckin' spic bastard!
- Where you going, man?

02:03:59.028 --> 02:04:03.028
- Nobody gets back here!
- Damn it, get the fuck out of here!

02:04:09.628 --> 02:04:12.328
Come on, let's go. We'll get him outside.

02:04:22.627 --> 02:04:24.527
There he is! Come on!

02:05:46.325 --> 02:05:47.925
What do you want me to do?

02:05:50.725 --> 02:05:52.424
I can't do nothin'.

02:06:14.124 --> 02:06:15.824

02:09:41.617 --> 02:09:45.317

Which way I go for that?

02:09:45.517 --> 02:09:48.217

02:10:11.416 --> 02:10:12.916
There he is!

Vinnie, wait up.

02:11:03.915 --> 02:11:06.715
He ain't up here. Let's go down. Come on.

Remember me?

02:14:56.608 --> 02:14:58.708
Benny Blanco from the Bronx?

02:15:16.107 --> 02:15:19.707
No hard feelings.
But I got to think about my future, too.

02:15:21.007 --> 02:15:24.507
You know, it is that way sometimes, papi.
Come on, let's go.

02:15:25.107 --> 02:15:26.307
No, you stay here.

02:15:33.107 --> 02:15:34.607
Don't try to talk.

02:15:35.307 --> 02:15:38.706
We're gonna get you to a hospital.
You're gonna be okay.

02:15:38.806 --> 02:15:41.606
Just hold on, baby. Just hold on.

02:15:43.206 --> 02:15:46.106
Hold on, baby. Please, hold on.

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:49.406
Take this.

02:15:55.306 --> 02:15:58.006
Take it and get out.

02:16:27.605 --> 02:16:28.905

Please don't leave me.

02:16:45.603 --> 02:16:46.804
Don't go.

02:16:50.504 --> 02:16:52.504
You can't do this to me.

02:16:54.704 --> 02:16:57.004
Oh, God. Don't leave me.

02:17:44.003 --> 02:17:45.402
Sorry, boys...

02:17:46.602 --> 02:17:50.201
...all the stitches in the world
can't sew me together again.

02:17:51.602 --> 02:17:55.402
Lay down. Lay down.

02:17:55.902 --> 02:17:59.602
Gonna stretch me out
in Fernandez Funeral Home on 109th St.

02:18:01.002 --> 02:18:03.502
Always knew I'd make a stop there...

02:18:04.402 --> 02:18:07.602
...but a lot later
than a whole gang of people thought.

02:18:08.701 --> 02:18:10.502
Last of the Mo-Ricans.

02:18:11.902 --> 02:18:13.902
Well, maybe not the last.

02:18:16.502 --> 02:18:18.601
Gail's gonna be a good mom.

02:18:19.501 --> 02:18:22.501
New, improved Carlito Brigante.

02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:27.101
Hope she uses the money to get out.

02:18:27.601 --> 02:18:30.700
No room in this city
for big hearts like hers.

02:18:31.501 --> 02:18:32.800
Sorry, baby.

02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:38.300
I tried the best I could. Honest.

02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:42.501
Can't come with me on this trip, though.

02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:46.101
Gettin' the shakes now.

02:18:46.901 --> 02:18:50.600
Last call for drinks. Bar's closin' down.

02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:53.600
Sun's out.

02:18:54.299 --> 02:18:56.200
Where we goin' for breakfast?

02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:59.400
Don't wanna go far.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.400
Rough night.

02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.000
Tired baby...

02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:07.700
...tired.
