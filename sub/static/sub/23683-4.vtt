00:01.002 --> 00:02.337
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.420 --> 00:05.423
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm bipolar.

00:05.507 --> 00:08.510
And my drug protocol
is fucked up.

00:08.593 --> 00:11.846
Apparently, I've
developed a lithium tolerance.

00:11.930 --> 00:13.390
Dr. Meyer told you this?

00:13.473 --> 00:15.183
Basically, she wants me to...

00:15.266 --> 00:18.645
sedate myself into a coma
to break the manic cycle.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.065
Okay, stop.
This is far enough. Stop.

00:22.148 --> 00:24.984
Hello. I'm looking
for Brett O'Keefe.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.404
Must be a slow week
in Washington

00:27.487 --> 00:29.072
if the president
sends her new

00:29.155 --> 00:30.990
national security advisor
down here.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.701
Saul!

00:32.784 --> 00:34.619
Get out of there! Run!

00:34.703 --> 00:36.121
Run!

00:36.204 --> 00:38.540
There's no need
for this to end badly.

00:38.623 --> 00:40.250
Well, it won't be
without a fight,

00:40.333 --> 00:42.335
I can tell you that.

00:42.419 --> 00:46.047
I ran down that photo
you sent me. Simone Martin.

00:46.131 --> 00:47.465
Met David Wellington
in Budapest four years ago.

00:47.549 --> 00:49.175
They've been involved
on and off ever since.

00:49.259 --> 00:51.845
<i>A vehicle registered
to this woman was issued</i>

00:51.928 --> 00:53.596
<i>a parking ticket
in Hazelton, West Virginia,</i>

00:53.680 --> 00:55.807
<i>where General McClendon
was sentenced to spend</i>

00:55.890 --> 00:57.434
<i>the rest of his life.</i>

00:57.517 --> 01:00.019
It's also
the day before he died.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.440
We have
a time-sensitive matter

01:03.523 --> 01:04.691
we need to bring
to your attention.

01:04.774 --> 01:07.694
We have fresh intel that Assad
is mounting an offensive

01:07.777 --> 01:09.195
against the Free Syrian Army.

01:09.279 --> 01:12.782
Excuse me, General, this is the
same briefing I got last week.

01:12.866 --> 01:16.119
What makes you think
I've changed my position?

01:16.202 --> 01:18.705
That arms shipment
to the Assad regime?

01:18.788 --> 01:20.790
The window's still open
for an air strike.

01:20.874 --> 01:23.460
I am not gonna blow up
a convoy in Syria

01:23.543 --> 01:25.295
in order to control
the news cycle.

01:25.378 --> 01:27.130
Rossen here.

01:27.213 --> 01:29.799
<i>General,
it's David Wellington.</i>

01:29.883 --> 01:31.634
The president's come around.

01:31.718 --> 01:33.470
She just approved
the Syrian mission.

01:33.553 --> 01:36.598
You say the president
authorized the strike.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.183
You have my word.

01:46.441 --> 01:48.985
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:49.068 --> 01:50.612
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:50.695 --> 01:55.033
<i>What was his name?</i>

01:55.116 --> 01:58.536
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

01:58.620 --> 02:01.289
<i>But you don't have
my condition.</i>

02:01.372 --> 02:03.750
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

02:03.833 --> 02:05.251
<i>since I was 22.</i>

02:06.920 --> 02:10.465
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

02:10.548 --> 02:13.426
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

02:13.510 --> 02:17.138
<i>Civil... War.</i>

02:17.222 --> 02:19.265
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:19.349 --> 02:22.268
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:22.352 --> 02:25.021
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:25.104 --> 02:26.439
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:26.523 --> 02:30.860
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:33.613 --> 02:36.991
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:37.075 --> 02:40.745
<i>We're talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:40.829 --> 02:44.040
<i>Our country
is under attack.</i>

02:45.458 --> 02:49.087
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:50.421 --> 02:53.716
<i>I swore an oath
to protect it.</i>

02:55.927 --> 02:57.887
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

02:57.971 --> 03:03.643
<i>a beacon steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

03:22.120 --> 03:25.290
Fuck.

03:31.963 --> 03:34.215
- Madam President.
- Wait here, please.

03:34.299 --> 03:36.009
Close it.

03:39.679 --> 03:41.472
You heard?

03:41.556 --> 03:43.975
I heard. I was waiting
for you to call.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.603
So all the intelligence services
listening in could hear

03:46.686 --> 03:48.855
that my presidency's
just been hijacked?

03:48.938 --> 03:50.607
I don't think so.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.609
Those fucking generals
sat there

03:52.692 --> 03:54.193
<i>with their stars
on their shoulders,</i>

03:54.277 --> 03:56.613
<i>nodding their heads like
they were actually listening.</i>

03:56.696 --> 03:59.324
Then went ahead and did
whatever the hell they wanted.

03:59.407 --> 04:03.411
It wasn't the generals,
Elizabeth. It was me.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.081
- What?
<i>- It was me.</i>

04:07.165 --> 04:10.209
<i>I authorized the air strike
in your name.</i>

04:10.293 --> 04:12.378
I tried telling you
last night,

04:12.462 --> 04:15.256
you're on track to be the first
president since Harrison

04:15.340 --> 04:18.676
not to make it through
a hundred days.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.387
We needed to put one up
in the win column.

04:21.471 --> 04:24.015
The win column?

04:24.098 --> 04:26.351
Are you out of your mind?

04:26.434 --> 04:27.435
Have you seen what
they're saying about you

04:27.518 --> 04:28.895
- on the morning shows?
- I don't care

04:28.978 --> 04:31.022
- what they're saying.
- Well, you should. It's all

04:31.105 --> 04:32.523
about how you
just announced yourself

04:32.607 --> 04:35.693
on the world stage,
how you're learning on the job.

04:35.777 --> 04:38.696
Between this
and releasing the 200,

04:38.780 --> 04:40.865
I think we finally
turned a corner.

04:40.949 --> 04:44.535
So I should be grateful that
a mission I said "no" to

04:44.619 --> 04:47.664
gets a thumbs up from
the morning talk show crowd?!

04:47.747 --> 04:49.374
<i>You should be
grateful you get to</i>

04:49.457 --> 04:51.376
<i>wipe the slate
and start over.</i>

04:51.459 --> 04:55.088
Very few presidents
are so lucky.

04:55.171 --> 04:58.841
I should have you arrested.

05:03.388 --> 05:05.431
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

05:07.141 --> 05:09.185
A long time ago,

05:09.268 --> 05:12.230
you asked me to run your first
campaign for state office.

05:12.313 --> 05:16.067
<i>I was doing national races
at the time, but I said "yes"</i>

05:16.150 --> 05:18.236
<i>because I had this feeling</i>

05:18.319 --> 05:20.697
we'd be here someday
in the White House.

05:21.656 --> 05:24.033
You want my resignation,
I'll resign.

05:24.117 --> 05:26.536
You want me in jail?
I'll go.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.038
But all I care about,
all I care about is

05:29.122 --> 05:34.043
you having a chance to show them
you can be a great president,

05:34.127 --> 05:37.630
a great president,
and you have that in you,

05:37.714 --> 05:40.925
and I've known it
from the beginning.

05:52.979 --> 05:54.230
Carrie?

06:02.905 --> 06:05.158
You're not gonna believe
what just happened.

06:05.241 --> 06:06.534
- What?
- Wellington and Keane.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.994
She was just lambasting him
in his house,

06:08.077 --> 06:09.704
'cause the air strike
in Syria? She said no way.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.581
- He authorized it anyway.
- What?

06:11.664 --> 06:13.124
He authorized it.
That's what he said.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.459
And then he got all weird,
how she's got it in her

06:14.542 --> 06:15.752
to become this great president.

06:15.835 --> 06:18.713
I mean, it's crazy town.
Anything is possible.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.506
So if we were wondering
if that guy's capable

06:20.590 --> 06:23.301
of taking out McClendon,
I'd say it's a big fucking yes.

06:31.684 --> 06:33.853
- We've gotta tell Dante.
- Forget it.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.064
- He needs to know.
- There's no way you'd know

06:36.147 --> 06:37.940
what you just told me
without the surveillance,

06:38.024 --> 06:41.652
and the surveillance leads
right back to me.

06:41.736 --> 06:43.613
- Fine.
- No one can know.

06:43.696 --> 06:46.407
- That was the deal.
- I said fine.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.746
So you said you had something
you want me to look at.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.707
Yeah.
Not as mind-blowing as that.

06:54.791 --> 06:58.044
But I did get a download
from his girlfriend's computer.

06:58.127 --> 07:00.379
She was up in Hazelton,
where McClendon died,

07:00.463 --> 07:01.672
just hours before
it happened.

07:01.756 --> 07:04.092
- And you know this how?
- Dante.

07:04.175 --> 07:07.512
The guy you don't trust
to tell about the surveillance?

07:07.595 --> 07:10.223
He found a parking ticket
she got while she was there.

07:10.306 --> 07:13.017
I'll take a look.

07:14.936 --> 07:17.271
What are you doing?

07:17.355 --> 07:18.648
While you're unlocking
her e-mails,

07:18.731 --> 07:20.024
I'm gonna go to Hazelton.

07:20.108 --> 07:23.820
Maybe I can figure out
what she was doing there.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.989
I thought you were grounded.

07:30.409 --> 07:33.162
So you can rest.

07:33.246 --> 07:35.081
I need to borrow your car.

07:46.843 --> 07:48.553
Could use some help out here!

08:16.622 --> 08:18.583
Got it.

08:37.602 --> 08:39.520
That's a lot of firepower.

08:39.604 --> 08:41.689
Better safe than sorry.

08:43.274 --> 08:46.110
I didn't know
it was gonna get to this.

08:46.194 --> 08:48.863
I'm glad that somebody does.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.907
You probably
think twice now,

08:50.990 --> 08:52.700
a stranger asks
to spend the night.

08:52.783 --> 08:55.077
Someone should've told me
what you all were planning.

08:55.161 --> 08:58.706
Wasn't really a plan, ma'am.
More like a Hail Mary.

08:58.789 --> 09:01.042
You should've said. I could've
gotten the children out.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.627
So the Feds can use them
against us?

09:02.710 --> 09:04.253
- They're not safe here.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

09:04.337 --> 09:06.672
I know this situation
I have dragged you into

09:06.756 --> 09:09.425
is less than ideal,
but I want you to know,

09:09.508 --> 09:13.137
before any of you good people
comes close to getting hurt,

09:13.221 --> 09:14.472
especially the children,

09:14.555 --> 09:16.724
I will be walking down
that driveway

09:16.807 --> 09:19.852
and handing myself over
to the federales.

09:19.936 --> 09:21.187
Okay?

09:23.105 --> 09:25.608
In the meantime, though,
the way I see it,

09:25.691 --> 09:27.610
we hold all the cards.

09:29.237 --> 09:31.864
- What cards?
- Me. They don't want a fight.

09:31.948 --> 09:34.158
They just want me.
So if you're willing,

09:34.242 --> 09:37.662
how 'bout we just leave
their whole big,

09:37.745 --> 09:41.374
ugly battalion
out there a while?

09:41.457 --> 09:44.168
So the whole world can see.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.717
There we go.

10:02.561 --> 10:03.938
Yeah!

10:06.774 --> 10:08.943
Get the kids to the barn.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.572
Killed my drone. Son of a...

10:13.656 --> 10:16.117
Back it up.
Back it up. I wanna see.

10:17.285 --> 10:19.704
Yeah. There, there,
there, there.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.497
All right, tell me what
I'm lookin' at here,

10:21.580 --> 10:23.791
the guy with the gun.

10:23.874 --> 10:27.086
- His name's Andy Burke,
sir. A local survivalist.
- Uh-huh.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.212
There. Who are they?

10:28.296 --> 10:30.006
Uh, that's
Bo and Mary Elkins.

10:30.089 --> 10:31.424
They own the place
with the Van Dusens.

10:31.507 --> 10:32.842
And that's Brett O'Keefe.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.176
Yeah. Yeah, him I know.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.304
All right, so we got, uh,
40 people,

10:36.387 --> 10:39.390
six vehicles loaded
with food, weapons.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.725
I can't even count all the ammo.

10:40.808 --> 10:44.186
This is what you got us,
playing peacemaker?

10:44.270 --> 10:46.897
All right, we still need
to know what they're up to.

10:46.981 --> 10:49.191
- Go get me eyes
on these clowns, huh?
- Yes, sir.

12:28.457 --> 12:33.003
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I sure hope so.

12:33.087 --> 12:34.922
Um, this woman was in here
four days ago.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.341
Mid-afternoon, around 3:00 p.m.

12:37.425 --> 12:40.302
Let me guess. She wasn't here
for a payroll advance,

12:40.386 --> 12:42.138
was she... Carl?

12:42.221 --> 12:44.014
I can't talk about
our clients, ma'am.

12:44.098 --> 12:45.433
Well, not normally.
Of course not.

12:45.516 --> 12:48.811
But in this case,
your client is my sister.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.771
Doesn't matter.

12:50.855 --> 12:52.606
Yeah, well,
there we disagree.

12:52.690 --> 12:55.109
She's bipolar.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.653
- Do you know what that is?
- Not really.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.572
It's a form of crazy.

12:59.655 --> 13:01.198
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

13:01.282 --> 13:05.202
So if I seem a little agitated,
which I probably do, that's why.

13:08.456 --> 13:10.541
My sister lives with me
in my house,

13:10.624 --> 13:14.378
where she's not only driven my
entire family totally insane,

13:14.462 --> 13:18.132
she's managed to run up
debts of nearly $100,000

13:18.215 --> 13:21.135
that she cannot begin
to repay.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.679
I had her declared
incompetent.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.223
Like bad at things?

13:26.307 --> 13:29.185
It means she's not responsible
for her actions, Carl.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.354
I-I am. I am responsible.

13:32.438 --> 13:35.858
And I have legally enjoined
any access to funds for her.

13:35.941 --> 13:39.320
Any access. You see
where I'm going here?

13:39.403 --> 13:42.615
Okay, here's--
here's the thing, and I--

13:42.698 --> 13:45.534
and I apologize in advance
for having to put it this way,

13:45.618 --> 13:50.080
but if-if Dash Cash or-or
Cash Dash or whatever

13:50.164 --> 13:51.415
you call yourselves,
has been doing

13:51.499 --> 13:55.211
some kind of end run, has been
funneling money to her

13:55.294 --> 13:58.005
around the legal barriers
I have put in place,

13:58.088 --> 14:00.799
I have no choice
but to sue your asses,

14:00.883 --> 14:04.345
starting right here
with you.

14:04.428 --> 14:07.181
Hello?
Carl, you getting this?

14:08.307 --> 14:11.352
You might wanna find
yourself a lawyer.

14:15.356 --> 14:17.024
It wasn't-it wasn't
any $100,000.

14:17.107 --> 14:21.362
Uh, it's just one transfer.

14:21.445 --> 14:25.157
$9,950.

14:25.241 --> 14:28.244
I've never seen her before.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.999
Where are we supposed
to put these?

14:34.083 --> 14:36.877
Take these to the barn.

14:36.961 --> 14:38.254
Let's go.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.424
<i>As temperatures
are starting to warm up</i>

14:42.508 --> 14:45.261
<i>all across West Virginia
and Pennsylvania,</i>

14:45.344 --> 14:47.179
<i>let's take a look at...</i>

14:47.263 --> 14:49.932
<i>...highs in the upper 70s,
Monday and Tuesday...</i>

14:50.015 --> 14:52.935
Hey, don't point that here.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.395
Not unless you intended
to use it.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.146
<i>In a full compound</i>

14:56.230 --> 14:57.690
<i>in Lucasville, Virginia,</i>

14:57.773 --> 14:58.899
<i>where sources believe...</i>

14:58.983 --> 15:00.651
What the fuck is it now?

15:00.734 --> 15:02.528
<i>...may be hiding.</i>

15:02.611 --> 15:04.863
Where's J.J.?

15:04.947 --> 15:08.784
Bruno! Get back here! Bruno!

15:13.122 --> 15:15.916
Bruno!

15:16.000 --> 15:18.043
Bruno!

15:27.720 --> 15:29.555
You killed my dog!

15:33.517 --> 15:34.685
What'd you do?!

15:38.314 --> 15:40.691
Can you hear me, son?

15:40.774 --> 15:41.859
Can you hear me?

15:41.942 --> 15:44.069
Call the medics!
We need help here!

15:47.531 --> 15:49.074
Put your weapons down!

15:53.537 --> 15:56.582
Oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna be okay.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.085
- How is he?
- It's bad.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.587
Get him back to the house.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.422
Need-need some help.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.597
- Move, move.
- I heard shots.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.098
- Quiet.
<i>- One civilian casualty,</i>

16:13.182 --> 16:15.017
<i>teenage boy,
9-millimeter to the abdomen.</i>

16:15.100 --> 16:18.062
<i>- Also Special Agent Goodman,
now hostage.</i>
- Fuck!

16:21.982 --> 16:24.401
Let's get some help!

16:24.485 --> 16:27.696
Need some help. Need some help!

16:27.780 --> 16:30.199
Need some help in here!
Need some help!

16:32.076 --> 16:35.037
- Oh, my God!
- He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be all right.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.501
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.211
Bo! Bo!

16:42.294 --> 16:43.712
Bo!

16:43.796 --> 16:46.090
Everybody,
take a deep fucking breath!

16:46.173 --> 16:48.509
Bo, listen to me!
Listen to me!

16:48.592 --> 16:51.762
He's worth more
to us alive! Bo!

16:51.845 --> 16:54.515
Bo. Come on.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.031
$9,950.

17:11.115 --> 17:13.242
Just under the reporting limit.

17:13.325 --> 17:16.078
No sender name,
nothing but a reference number.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.080
<i>- Untraceable.</i>
- Basically.

17:18.163 --> 17:20.207
She tells them the number,
they hand her the cash,

17:20.290 --> 17:23.377
just hours before McClendon
eats it a half-mile away.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.712
So what are you thinking?

17:24.795 --> 17:27.214
The obvious. The money
was used for a payoff.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.465
To get McClendon killed?

17:28.549 --> 17:32.678
No, Max. So he'd have
a nicer room.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.222
I just meant that
$9,900 for a hit

17:35.305 --> 17:37.808
on a celebrity prisoner
in a federal supermax

17:37.891 --> 17:39.393
- seems kind of low.
<i>- Agreed.</i>

17:39.476 --> 17:42.187
So what I'm wondering
is where she went next.

17:42.271 --> 17:44.189
She must've gotten
more money somewhere.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.358
- Did you get into her e-mails?
- Yeah.

17:46.442 --> 17:47.818
There's nothing there so far.
She's supposedly

17:47.901 --> 17:51.155
the director of fund-raising
for a pro-Democracy NGO.

17:51.238 --> 17:54.158
<i>- And?</i>
- Looks like she actually is.

17:54.241 --> 17:57.453
I'm looking at a bunch
of photos of her.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.872
She's like
a professional partygoer.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.331
Send them to me.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.625
- Huh?
<i>- Send them.</i>

18:03.709 --> 18:08.213
Uh... Okay. Only, um...
where are you?

18:08.297 --> 18:10.591
Hazelton. Where do you think?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.677
Driving. You said
you had to be back

18:13.761 --> 18:15.721
by the time Franny got home.
You should've left there

18:15.804 --> 18:19.308
<i>- an hour ago.</i>
- Oh, shit.

18:21.018 --> 18:25.522
You shot... a kid.

18:25.606 --> 18:29.985
- A 16-year-old boy and his dog.
- How is he?

18:30.068 --> 18:33.697
He is bleeding. His whole
stomach's bright red.

18:33.781 --> 18:35.824
There's a hospital less than
20 minutes from here.

18:35.908 --> 18:37.201
I wanna move him.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.289
You there?

18:43.957 --> 18:47.252
I-I'll tell them that.
I don't know if they'll listen.

18:47.336 --> 18:48.754
Well, make 'em.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.840
I'm not in control here.

18:51.924 --> 18:53.383
Tell me about it.

18:53.467 --> 18:56.094
<i>You deal with it on your end,</i>

18:56.178 --> 18:58.347
I'll deal with it on mine.

18:59.890 --> 19:01.892
Who was that?

19:01.975 --> 19:05.354
O'Keefe. We're arranging to
move the kid to a hospital.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.147
No. Not until
I get my man back.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.357
Kid's bleeding out.
Your man shot him.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.485
- Raised a weapon.
- 16-year-old. They shot him.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.695
Do not fuck with me on this.
You will not like where it ends.

19:13.779 --> 19:16.406
Respectfully, you have
no chain of command here.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.742
Take it up with the Director.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.919
Saul, I-I'm heading

19:29.002 --> 19:31.213
into a meeting.
I gotta call you back.

19:31.296 --> 19:34.049
No, no, no, no, don't hang up.
Kid's been shot here by the FBI.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.551
Agent's been taken hostage.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.511
<i>FBI commander won't allow him</i>

19:37.594 --> 19:39.179
<i>to be transported
to a hospital.</i>

19:39.263 --> 19:40.597
<i>Not until he gets
his man back.</i>

19:40.681 --> 19:43.267
That's not gonna happen
before the kid bleeds out.

19:44.768 --> 19:47.646
I need the president
to intervene.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.692
David, did you hear me?

19:51.775 --> 19:54.611
Um, yeah, I-I'm not sure
that my relationship

19:54.695 --> 19:58.866
with the president can stand
more bad news today.

19:58.949 --> 20:02.244
What are you talking about?

20:02.327 --> 20:04.454
Kid is dying.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.290
Yeah, fine. Fine.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.208
I gotta call you back.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.841
Hey, Marcy,
I got an emergency.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.721
- Excuse me, Madam President.
- What is it?

20:20.804 --> 20:24.182
Saul Berenson called.
The FBI just shot a kid.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.476
Come in.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.446
It's the president
of the United States.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.885
Whew. You made it.

21:41.969 --> 21:44.513
Yeah.

21:44.596 --> 21:47.057
I'm Maggie. Carrie's sister.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.017
Ah. I'm Max.

21:49.101 --> 21:51.520
- Hi, Max.
- H-hi, Franny.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.605
So what are you doing?

21:53.689 --> 21:56.441
Uh, just software updates
for Carrie.

21:56.525 --> 21:59.861
Where is she, anyway?

21:59.945 --> 22:01.029
Downstairs?

22:01.113 --> 22:02.698
Not really.

22:02.781 --> 22:04.574
Uh...

22:04.658 --> 22:07.285
Do you wanna tell me?

22:07.369 --> 22:09.788
Max, hey.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.373
Hello, you!

22:11.456 --> 22:13.917
I-I gotta go.

22:14.001 --> 22:17.379
Uh, I'll walk you out.

22:20.090 --> 22:21.675
Bye, Max.

22:23.135 --> 22:26.013
I have no idea what happened
after she picked up the money

22:26.096 --> 22:27.723
from the place
you found up there,

22:27.806 --> 22:30.434
but before, she got off
the turnpike four times

22:30.517 --> 22:31.768
on her way there.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.228
Each stop was about
ten minutes long,

22:33.311 --> 22:34.730
and there's a cash place
at each exit.

22:34.813 --> 22:37.024
- How'd you find that out?
- You'll see. I sent it to you.

22:37.107 --> 22:39.860
So four along the turnpike,
plus Hazelton.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.863
- That's five pickups total.
- Yeah, in theory.

22:42.946 --> 22:45.282
Five times $9,900--
that's almost $50,000.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.742
That's enough to get
something done.

22:46.825 --> 22:50.871
Thank you. Thank you.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.122
Hey!

22:55.292 --> 22:57.002
How was your day?

22:57.085 --> 22:59.379
- Great.
- It was? It was great?

22:59.463 --> 23:02.007
Mwah. Mwah.

23:21.777 --> 23:25.447
Out! Hands where I can see 'em!

23:31.620 --> 23:32.913
Check him out.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.603
Search it.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.908
Hey, hey, w-we're only here
for the boy, all right?

24:11.827 --> 24:13.912
All right, lock it up.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.253
Staying on 'em.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.227
Where's the patient?

24:37.310 --> 24:39.980
Here.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.189
Great. Can you put
that on the wall there?

24:41.273 --> 24:42.858
- What's his name?
- J.J.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.902
Hey, J.J.? J.J., I'm Nate.
Mind if I take a look?

24:48.238 --> 24:51.074
There's no exit wound.

24:51.158 --> 24:53.410
- His pressure's low.
- What does that mean?

24:53.493 --> 24:54.870
It just means he's lost
a lot of blood.

24:54.953 --> 24:56.955
He could be going into shock, so
we wanna get some fluids in him.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.874
Here. Hold this.

24:58.957 --> 25:02.002
I'd like to check on him.

25:02.085 --> 25:06.089
Can you hold the bag
with the line?

25:06.173 --> 25:07.340
Go.

25:07.424 --> 25:10.343
Okay, listen here, J.J.
I just wanna see if I...

25:10.427 --> 25:14.097
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

25:16.183 --> 25:17.726
Let me put something on that.

25:17.809 --> 25:20.353
I need you to step back,
put your hand in my coat.

25:20.437 --> 25:23.940
- How's the boy?
- Gonna be okay.

25:24.024 --> 25:29.112
Be very careful. Sir,
can you stand on the left side?

25:29.196 --> 25:30.405
All right, everyone,
we're gonna lift him

25:30.488 --> 25:32.115
on three, okay?

25:35.952 --> 25:37.954
Gonna need some help.

25:38.038 --> 25:40.874
- You need water?
- Okay, enough.

25:40.957 --> 25:43.543
Hey, could use a hand in here.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.296
We're gonna move him, okay?

25:46.379 --> 25:48.048
You wanna grab right there.
You grab right there, okay?

25:48.131 --> 25:49.966
We're gonna get him up
on three, all right?

25:51.092 --> 25:52.761
- Thank you.
- Okay, everyone.

25:52.844 --> 25:57.474
One, two, three, lift.
All right. Easy.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.309
All right, J.J.,
you're doing good there.

26:02.646 --> 26:04.147
What is that?

26:07.025 --> 26:09.277
<i>First shots were fired today</i>

26:09.361 --> 26:12.405
<i>- in the war against America.</i>
- He's at it again.

26:12.489 --> 26:16.701
<i>...and the victim
was a 16-year-old boy</i>

26:16.785 --> 26:20.413
<i>shot in cold blood
by federal agents under</i>

26:20.497 --> 26:25.210
<i>a "shoot to kill" order issued
directly from the White House</i>

26:25.293 --> 26:28.421
<i>from the desk
of Elizabeth Keane.</i>

26:28.505 --> 26:30.215
What did I tell you?

26:30.298 --> 26:32.175
You make concessions to these
people, they piss on you.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.844
<i>It doesn't matter
if you're a three-star general</i>

26:34.928 --> 26:37.722
or a kid or a canine,
you are fair game.

26:37.806 --> 26:40.558
We all are
because here they come--

26:40.642 --> 26:42.769
Keane's trained assassins,

26:42.852 --> 26:45.146
her murderers, frothing thugs...

26:45.230 --> 26:47.274
Stop!

26:47.357 --> 26:49.985
What was that?

26:51.194 --> 26:53.154
Just stop.

26:57.409 --> 27:00.036
This is Brett O'Keefe

27:00.120 --> 27:03.290
coming to you from free America,

27:03.373 --> 27:05.709
fighting for our lives.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.946
Don't even bother.

27:36.865 --> 27:40.368
Light was still on.
I thought you were sleeping.

27:41.453 --> 27:44.122
Mm. Not tired.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.501
Not surprised.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.754
I am confused, though.

27:52.088 --> 27:56.134
After everything you said,
how scared you are,

27:56.217 --> 27:58.303
if you don't get this thing
under control,

27:58.386 --> 28:00.555
- what will happen to you...
- Okay.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.016
to Franny.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.851
You know where this ends.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.358
Are you even taking
your meds?

28:11.441 --> 28:13.401
Yes.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.153
I don't mean the lithium
we know isn't working.

28:15.236 --> 28:19.115
I mean the Seroquel that
will quiet you down enough

28:19.199 --> 28:22.035
so that you can reset
and start over.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.205
Yes.

28:25.288 --> 28:27.374
Yes, what?

28:27.457 --> 28:30.919
- I'm taking it.
- Really? You expect me

28:31.002 --> 28:32.379
to believe that when
you're the only one still up.

28:32.462 --> 28:36.716
- I'm taking it, okay?
- I'm taking it.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.594
Seroquel, see?

29:03.868 --> 29:06.496
Swallow it.

29:26.975 --> 29:29.394
<i>Trauma surgeon's
arriving from Richmond.</i>

29:29.477 --> 29:31.438
<i>They're prepping J.J.
as we speak.</i>

29:31.521 --> 29:33.648
- Took long enough.
<i>- Factor that in</i>

29:33.731 --> 29:35.150
next time you pick a family

29:35.233 --> 29:36.818
in the middle of nowhere
to drop in this shit.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.737
Hey, I'm not the one
shot the kid.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.614
<i>No. You're the one</i>

29:41.698 --> 29:43.950
who snuck in an armed militia
and put everyone in harm's way.

29:44.033 --> 29:45.702
That's better.

29:45.785 --> 29:48.246
<i>Know what
I'm lookin' at here?</i>

29:48.329 --> 29:50.290
An army.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.041
What do you got there?

29:52.125 --> 29:54.335
All high
on your toxic bullshit.

29:54.419 --> 29:56.337
<i>Same thing.</i>

29:56.421 --> 29:59.716
This seem like a stable
situation to you?

29:59.799 --> 30:01.801
So leave.

30:05.722 --> 30:07.932
Waco.

30:08.016 --> 30:10.101
Ruby Ridge.

30:11.144 --> 30:13.521
<i>They didn't start
as firefights.</i>

30:13.605 --> 30:17.192
They ended up there.

30:17.275 --> 30:20.528
'Cause with all these guns,
it's inevitable.

30:20.612 --> 30:22.530
Negotiators lose control.

30:22.614 --> 30:25.867
- What negotiators?
<i>- You and me.
You and me, O'Keefe,</i>

30:25.950 --> 30:27.368
we're the negotiators.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.037
We're the fucking grownups
in the room here,

30:29.120 --> 30:30.538
ones who don't want
any more casualties,

30:30.622 --> 30:32.957
let alone a shooting war.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.503
Am I wrong about that?

30:36.586 --> 30:38.838
You're not wrong.

30:38.922 --> 30:41.174
<i>Wanna end this, you can.</i>

30:41.257 --> 30:42.509
How?

30:42.592 --> 30:45.136
Give yourself up.

30:45.220 --> 30:48.515
Oh, I give myself up.
You call that negotiating?

30:48.598 --> 30:51.601
Fine. Stay put.
Then don't act surprised

30:51.684 --> 30:53.353
when the next person
gets shot.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.564
<i>What about the other kids?</i>

30:58.441 --> 30:59.526
What about 'em?

30:59.609 --> 31:01.194
Kids and their mothers.
We get 'em out of there.

31:01.277 --> 31:04.364
So the Feds can arrest 'em?

31:04.447 --> 31:06.908
None of them will be arrested.
You have my word.

31:08.785 --> 31:10.370
For fuck's safe.

31:10.453 --> 31:12.372
<i>Forget how you
leverage this for yourself.</i>

31:12.455 --> 31:15.875
Do something decent
for once in your life.

31:15.959 --> 31:19.295
You don't even get it.
It's not me.

31:19.379 --> 31:21.673
These guys
are bringing it on

31:21.756 --> 31:25.051
like it's
their own private Alamo.

31:25.134 --> 31:27.220
Well, remind them
how that ended.

31:28.763 --> 31:31.140
I'll get back to you.

31:35.270 --> 31:36.854
How's he doing?

31:36.938 --> 31:38.439
How old is the kid?
Can't comment.
Sorry.

31:38.523 --> 31:41.234
What does the doctor
say? Is he going to make it?

31:41.317 --> 31:44.237
Can you confirm the boy's name?
Is he one of the Elkins family?

31:44.320 --> 31:48.157
How many times was he shot?

31:48.241 --> 31:49.701
We have no comment.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.530
Heart rate 122...

33:09.614 --> 33:11.532
Yeah,
it's at the nurses station.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.369
Pupils are
equal and reactive...

33:14.452 --> 33:15.995
Doing a great job, okay?

33:16.079 --> 33:17.413
...are looking better. I'm
gonna listen to his lung sounds.

33:17.497 --> 33:19.082
He's got
a good radial pulse.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.667
They're clear and equal.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.211
We'll hold off on...

33:25.630 --> 33:27.173
Pressure's coming up.
See if we can get a little

33:27.256 --> 33:30.468
bit more fluid on board
to slow down his heart rate.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.347
I think it's just isolated
to the front quadrant.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.015
Checking the level.

33:38.518 --> 33:41.604
Let's keep prepping him.
Get him ready for surgery.

33:41.688 --> 33:43.690
Let me know when
they're good to go.

33:46.317 --> 33:49.028
- Enzymes are looking better.
- Relax. You're all right.

33:49.112 --> 33:50.405
Pupils are active...

33:50.488 --> 33:53.533
No sign of
neurological disability.

34:20.977 --> 34:23.354
Are you here?

34:23.438 --> 34:25.231
<i>Yeah. Almost.</i>

34:25.314 --> 34:26.983
<i>You sound strange.
Something wrong?</i>

34:27.066 --> 34:29.694
Yeah. My sister.

34:29.777 --> 34:32.989
- I'll be right down.
<i>- Okay.</i>

34:57.764 --> 35:00.850
Jesus.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.602
Just drive.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.662
<i>All teams stand down.</i>

35:21.746 --> 35:24.540
<i>We're bringing out
the kids now.</i>

35:33.925 --> 35:37.053
Your ride's here.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.305
There'll be cameras waiting.

35:39.388 --> 35:40.723
- I know.
- The media.

35:40.807 --> 35:43.643
You said already. Are you
trying to make me nervous?

35:43.726 --> 35:48.105
No, absolutely not.
They're expecting some nut job.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.817
You know that, right?
Bible in one hand,

35:50.900 --> 35:55.029
bottle of Oxy in the other.

35:55.112 --> 35:57.532
When they see
who you really are,

35:57.615 --> 36:00.201
I predict it knocks
their socks off.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.456
Be <i>our</i> ambassador.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.875
You tell them what
we're fighting for.

36:07.959 --> 36:11.671
I'm doing this for my boys.

36:11.754 --> 36:15.258
You said you'd hand yourself
over before anyone got hurt.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.718
But you're still here.

36:27.854 --> 36:29.647
First things first.

36:29.730 --> 36:31.858
Methylphenidate.

36:31.941 --> 36:34.235
This is a Ritalin knockoff
I get from Mumbai.

36:34.318 --> 36:37.238
Take a couple now.
Sublingual.

36:37.321 --> 36:41.033
Next... Straterol.

36:41.117 --> 36:43.119
Potentiates the Methyl,
lets you spread out your doses,

36:43.202 --> 36:45.746
which is something you are
definitely going to want to do.

36:45.830 --> 36:49.083
Finally, Magnesium.
Over-the-counter.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.710
Helps with
the teeth clenching.

36:52.420 --> 36:55.673
600 bucks of meds there.
Yours for 120.

36:55.756 --> 36:56.674
Thank God for India.

36:56.757 --> 36:57.884
Is it safe?

36:57.967 --> 37:01.053
That depends on you.
She's gonna be surfing.

37:01.137 --> 37:02.471
Up, down.

37:02.555 --> 37:05.182
The Seroquel that
the doctors are pushing?

37:05.266 --> 37:08.060
Avoid it, except when
she's too crazy.

37:08.144 --> 37:10.271
And these are for when
she's too down,

37:10.354 --> 37:13.858
drooling like some zombie.
That sort of thing.

37:13.941 --> 37:16.277
You gotta watch me,
tell me when to medicate.

37:16.360 --> 37:21.407
- What, you won't know yourself?
- That's the scary part. No.

37:23.618 --> 37:28.122
- Thanks, Josh.
- Yeah. Anytime.

37:28.205 --> 37:30.124
We miss you.

37:30.207 --> 37:31.667
You know that, right?

37:37.590 --> 37:40.593
If you-if you're not up
for this, I totally understand.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.845
Surfing?

37:42.929 --> 37:44.347
Yeah and, um...

37:44.430 --> 37:47.600
there's something else.

37:47.683 --> 37:49.518
You know that parking ticket
you found?

37:49.602 --> 37:51.020
That Wellington's
girlfriend got?

37:51.103 --> 37:52.939
- In Hazelton.
- Right.

37:53.022 --> 37:55.608
Well, it turns out
that's just the end

37:55.691 --> 37:58.277
of a very strange trip
she took to get there.

37:58.361 --> 38:00.404
Strange how?

38:00.488 --> 38:02.448
She exited the turnpike
four times

38:02.531 --> 38:04.700
along the way from D.C.
to collect cash,

38:04.784 --> 38:07.495
just under ten grand
each time.

38:07.578 --> 38:09.246
Her final pickup,
number five,

38:09.330 --> 38:11.165
is where she got that
parking ticket.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.584
That's almost
$50,000 altogether,

38:13.668 --> 38:15.378
which she arrives with
in Hazelton

38:15.461 --> 38:18.798
just a few hours before
McClendon dies there.

38:18.881 --> 38:20.341
So you're saying
she's a bag man.

38:27.181 --> 38:29.684
So do I bring her in?

38:29.767 --> 38:31.352
Say what? I broke into
her apartment

38:31.435 --> 38:32.895
and found some stuff
on her computer?

38:32.979 --> 38:35.898
Maybe I could get a warrant
after the fact.

38:35.982 --> 38:37.858
Even if you could,
she's not our target.

38:37.942 --> 38:41.737
We've gotta connect her
and the money to Wellington.

38:43.823 --> 38:45.950
How?

38:46.033 --> 38:48.703
Well, I've got a thought
about that,

38:48.786 --> 38:50.538
which will be
completely illegal.

38:50.621 --> 38:52.957
Yeah, like you rifling through
her apartment wasn't.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.458
That was me.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.919
This will be us.

38:57.003 --> 38:59.005
An operation, kind of thing
we used to in Kabul.

38:59.088 --> 39:01.799
If things fuck up,
the badge won't save you.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.472
So?

39:10.224 --> 39:12.977
It's a big ask, all this,
I know. If-if it's too much...

39:15.271 --> 39:17.398
I'm in.

39:54.477 --> 39:56.062
Okay, I've got
the eyes on 'em.

39:57.772 --> 39:59.690
Hey, I got three women
and ten kids

39:59.774 --> 40:01.859
heading for the van.
We'll do a health check,

40:01.942 --> 40:04.195
- then debrief.
- On the way to the hospital.

40:14.997 --> 40:16.332
Right this way, ma'am.

40:16.415 --> 40:17.750
The kids need to be off
to the side, please.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.460
<i>...who was shot
in the armed standoff</i>

40:19.543 --> 40:22.922
<i>with federal agents
at his family's farm has died</i>

40:23.005 --> 40:25.341
<i>- in a Lucasville hospital.</i>
- Sir, you better look at this.

40:25.424 --> 40:26.967
<i>The</i> Richmond Gazette

40:27.051 --> 40:28.844
<i>was the first to report
the story, along with an image</i>

40:28.928 --> 40:31.097
<i>of what appears to be the boy,
who has been identified</i>

40:31.180 --> 40:33.349
- Oh, Christ.
<i>- by law enforcement officials</i>

40:33.432 --> 40:35.101
<i>as J.J. Elkins,

40:37.686 --> 40:39.438
<i>Photo has been circulating
on social media.</i>

40:39.522 --> 40:41.649
- What the fuck is this?
- No, no, no, no.
This is bullshit.

40:41.732 --> 40:42.900
I just
talked to the hospital.

40:42.983 --> 40:44.693
The kid's in recovery.
He's fine.

40:44.777 --> 40:45.945
- Family doesn't know that.
- I'm telling you, he's fine.

40:46.028 --> 40:47.863
Please spread your legs.

40:52.451 --> 40:54.495
- Yeah.
- Saul Berenson.

40:54.578 --> 40:58.999
- They're walking to you now.
- I'm not calling about the kids.
There's a news report about J.J.

40:59.083 --> 41:00.292
What happened to him?

41:00.376 --> 41:01.710
<i>Nothing happened to him.
That's the point.</i>

41:01.794 --> 41:04.880
There's a rumor circulating,
false, that he died.

41:04.964 --> 41:07.800
- What?
- Bo! Get in here now.

41:07.883 --> 41:10.010
- You gotta see this.
<i>- ...federal agents</i>

41:10.094 --> 41:12.513
<i>on what he referred to
as a "kill order."</i>

41:12.596 --> 41:14.056
O'Keefe, listen to me.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.725
<i>Nothing happened!
He's fine!</i>

41:16.809 --> 41:18.894
<i>...informed us that the boy
was wounded after...</i>

41:18.978 --> 41:22.523
J.J. is fine. Tell them
it's not true. J.J.'s fine.

41:22.606 --> 41:24.859
- We'll put him on the phone.
- What is this?

41:24.942 --> 41:26.360
Call the hospital.
Get a news cam in there.

41:26.443 --> 41:27.653
<i>Put the kid on the phone.</i>

41:27.736 --> 41:29.864
Tell 'em it is not true.

41:29.947 --> 41:32.908
<i>- Just tell 'em it's fine!
- Shocking...</i>

41:32.992 --> 41:34.118
He's fine!

41:34.201 --> 41:36.412
- How do you know?
<i>- Yeah, fuck you, asshole!</i>

41:36.495 --> 41:38.122
Just tell 'em it's not true.

41:38.205 --> 41:39.999
Fucking government. I knew it.

41:40.082 --> 41:41.876
He's fine!

41:41.959 --> 41:44.086
<i>O'Keefe, do you hear me?</i>

41:47.256 --> 41:48.340
What's going on?

41:55.514 --> 41:58.642
- What happened?
- Fuck.

41:58.726 --> 42:00.227
Grab the kids.
Don't let 'em leave.

42:00.311 --> 42:03.105
- Run! Run, run, run, run!
- Get in! Get in! Get in!

42:03.189 --> 42:05.232
Move, move, move!

42:05.316 --> 42:08.569
What happened?
Tell me what just happened!

42:08.652 --> 42:11.363
He shot my guy!
We're going in!

42:11.447 --> 42:12.448
- Get down!
- Positions!

42:12.531 --> 42:13.866
- Take cover!
- Run!

42:13.949 --> 42:16.035
Move, move, move!

42:16.118 --> 42:18.704
All units proceed.
Take them down.

42:18.787 --> 42:20.206
Wait, don't do this.

42:20.289 --> 42:21.207
Aah!

42:31.217 --> 42:32.509
Go, go, go, go!

42:32.593 --> 42:34.345
Go, go, go!

43:07.086 --> 43:10.256
This is Brett O'Keefe,
coming to you from free America.

43:10.339 --> 43:13.384
We've been betrayed!
Elizabeth Keane has broken

43:13.467 --> 43:15.636
<i>the truce, sending tanks
and machine guns...</i>

43:15.719 --> 43:17.346
How is he still on?
Kill the towers.

43:17.429 --> 43:19.848
- Then we can't talk to 'em.
- Shut 'em down! All of it!

43:19.932 --> 43:23.060
- Let's go! Everything!
- ...patriots to take up arms

43:23.143 --> 43:24.520
against tyranny...

43:24.603 --> 43:26.105
Coming through.

43:27.356 --> 43:30.693
Lucasville. The FBI's gone in,
a full-on assault.

43:30.776 --> 43:32.778
Get Saul Berenson.

43:32.861 --> 43:35.698
- Madam President.
- You have to stop this.

43:35.781 --> 43:36.865
<i>I can't.</i>

43:36.949 --> 43:40.911
Wounded boy's father
executed the hostage.

43:40.995 --> 43:42.997
FBI commander ordered
everyone in.

43:43.080 --> 43:48.002
- Give him to me.
- Too late. It's done.

43:52.756 --> 43:55.509
I'm sorry.

44:05.602 --> 44:07.646
...tyranny of...

44:07.730 --> 44:10.274
Aah! Aah!

44:25.414 --> 44:28.292
Target secured.
