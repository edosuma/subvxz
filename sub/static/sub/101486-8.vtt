WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:09.675
<i> CHALMERS:</i>
<i> Next item on the agenda.</i>

00:09.826 --> 00:10.992
Principal Duggins.

00:11.053 --> 00:13.661
Well, I see that not one
of your students

00:13.723 --> 00:16.590
was able to meet
the national fitness standards:

00:16.684 --> 00:17.999
a light jog.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.576
-(moans softly)
-Come on, Duggins.

00:19.636 --> 00:21.928
You got to be a role model
for those lazy kids.

00:22.081 --> 00:24.931
Tell them you put in
two hours a day stretching...

00:25.084 --> 00:27.751
your lap band.
(laughs)

00:27.853 --> 00:29.253
(munching)

00:29.271 --> 00:30.754
(imitates stomach stretching
and popping)

00:30.856 --> 00:32.814
(all laughing)

00:34.093 --> 00:36.777
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you, Principal Finch.

00:36.871 --> 00:40.597
Well, I guess we can cross
"hilarious joke" off the agenda.

00:40.657 --> 00:42.616
Oh, I-I've also got
a funny thing.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.769
(chuckles)
Duggins' wife was unfaithful.

00:45.829 --> 00:47.212
(chuckles)

00:47.405 --> 00:50.865
Skinner,
learn how to read a room.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.943
-Sorry, Duggins.
-Screw you.

00:53.003 --> 00:56.613
Indeed. Now, as you all know,
this weekend in Cincinnati

00:56.673 --> 00:59.783
is the national
administrator's convention,

00:59.843 --> 01:01.226
or EDU-CON.

01:01.419 --> 01:04.121
And, uh, well,
I have been invited

01:04.223 --> 01:06.123
to give the keynote address.

01:06.141 --> 01:08.716
-(excited chatter)
-Oh, well.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.569
Yes. Uh, Sunday.
(chuckles)

01:10.762 --> 01:12.145
Main auditorium.

01:12.239 --> 01:16.033
The Proctor & Gamble Room?
Crushed it!

01:17.078 --> 01:19.152
(Skinner inhales, grunts)

01:19.246 --> 01:21.638
Well, that couldn't
have gone worse.

01:21.698 --> 01:22.823
I agree.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.083
Yes, well, as you all know,

01:24.276 --> 01:26.901
the budget
allows for a plus-one,

01:26.921 --> 01:28.587
and I was thinking I would bring

01:28.756 --> 01:31.832
the principal
with the highest test scores,

01:31.926 --> 01:34.284
-Finch.
-Well, that's not fair.

01:34.378 --> 01:36.762
Finch runs the magnet school
for gifted test takers.

01:36.955 --> 01:39.914
Uh, sorry, Seymour,
but I have made my decision.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.326
If it makes you feel any better,
you were never in the running.

01:42.436 --> 01:46.087
Hey, we are gonna
light Cincinnati up.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.515
I got a buddy who used to be the
long snapper for the Bengals.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.851
He co-owns
this amazing poké place.

01:51.003 --> 01:52.669
Seaweed, furikake,

01:52.729 --> 01:54.020
soakin' in ponzu!

01:54.115 --> 01:57.032
My God, you're cool.

01:59.769 --> 02:02.604
Okay, this is
for all the marbles.

02:02.665 --> 02:04.531
(grunts)

02:04.683 --> 02:08.018
(laughs) No wonder Chalmers
is taking Finch to Cincinnati.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.519
How'd you hear about that?

02:09.621 --> 02:11.355
It's all over the playground.

02:11.415 --> 02:12.856
♪<i> Chalmers went to Cincy</i> ♪

02:12.875 --> 02:14.449

02:17.471 --> 02:19.805
♪<i> One, two, three, four, five.</i> ♪

02:19.956 --> 02:21.381
Well, as usual,

02:21.475 --> 02:23.867
the double Dutchers
have zeroed in on my pain.

02:23.886 --> 02:25.385
(sighs)

02:25.479 --> 02:27.663
Look, Seymour, are you ready
for some tough love?

02:27.690 --> 02:28.722
Is there any other kind?

02:28.858 --> 02:30.390
Being around you sucks.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.651
No one's ever gonna invite you
to anything.

02:32.802 --> 02:34.302
If there's a party
you want to go to,

02:34.321 --> 02:35.562
you got to crash it,

02:35.656 --> 02:37.381
or you'll spend
the rest of your life

02:37.441 --> 02:40.492
sitting around with your hand
stuck in a pelvis.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.888
It's too late.
The plus-one has been invoked.

02:44.948 --> 02:46.981
Dude, you're Seymour Skinner.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.334
No matter how badly
you're treated,

02:49.527 --> 02:50.560
you keep coming back for more.

02:50.621 --> 02:52.987
That's your superpower. Use it!

02:53.090 --> 02:55.632
You're right. I will.

02:57.252 --> 03:00.304
Aw, look at you,
grazing the thumb.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.017
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.518
(phone rings)

03:06.687 --> 03:08.094
Finch, where are you?

03:08.189 --> 03:09.671
We're going to miss our flight.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.172
<i> Can't make it, Gary.</i>

03:11.192 --> 03:12.507
<i> I ate some pre-trip poké</i>
<i> last night,</i>

03:12.643 --> 03:14.418
<i> and it's blitzkrieging</i>
<i> my intestines.</i>

03:14.519 --> 03:17.087
<i> I'm firing salmon eggs</i>
<i> from both ends.</i>

03:17.105 --> 03:18.755
But you're my ride
to the airport.

03:18.815 --> 03:21.591
My car's in the shop
being winterized.

03:21.610 --> 03:23.760
<i> Sorry, dude. Yeah? Cool.</i>

03:23.820 --> 03:25.595
(groans)

03:25.614 --> 03:28.207
Hop in, sir. We still have time
to make our flight.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.210
Skinner?
W-What are you doing here?

03:31.403 --> 03:33.528
Well, I saw
on Finch's InstaSnap story

03:33.547 --> 03:35.439
that he's firing salmon eggs
from both ends.

03:35.499 --> 03:37.624
So I rushed over here at once.

03:37.776 --> 03:39.885
You want to come with me
to Cincinnat-- No. Thank you.

03:40.078 --> 03:42.629
Very thoughtful, Seymour,
but I-I wouldn't want to...

03:42.723 --> 03:44.723
You wouldn't want
the school board to find out

03:44.892 --> 03:47.226
you wasted the transferrable
but not refundable

03:47.419 --> 03:50.878
$65 plus-one registration fee?

03:50.940 --> 03:53.565
(sighs)
No, I would not.

03:53.758 --> 03:56.151
Oh, boy.

03:58.130 --> 04:00.146
(grunting)

04:00.241 --> 04:03.133
Ah,<i> Game Night.</i>
(chuckles)

04:03.193 --> 04:04.892
Jason Bateman,
your boyish charisma

04:04.954 --> 04:07.637
was made
for the low-res seatback screen.

04:07.698 --> 04:08.730
(whimpers)

04:08.791 --> 04:10.156
Sir, are you all right?

04:10.309 --> 04:11.566
Uh, if you must know,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.735
flying makes me
just a little bit nervous.

04:13.796 --> 04:15.312
Where'd you put my carry-on?

04:15.372 --> 04:17.497
I'm going to pop
an antianxiety pill.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.983
Oh, I gate-checked your bag.
It's free,

04:20.043 --> 04:22.486
and you don't have to fight
for precious overhead space.

04:22.504 --> 04:24.671
Another classic
Skinner travel hack.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.266
My pills were in that bag,
you idiot!

04:27.417 --> 04:30.385
You-- Okay. Okay.
(chuckles) I can do this.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.163
(exhales) It's just
a short domestic flight.

04:33.223 --> 04:35.440
I'm completely safe, right?

04:35.592 --> 04:37.350
Sure. And if you're stressed,
you can take comfort

04:37.444 --> 04:40.094
in the passengers'
many emotional support animals.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.597
CHALMERS:
Ugh. Aah!

04:42.658 --> 04:43.448
-(oinks)
-Pig?

04:43.600 --> 04:45.191
-(gobbles)
-Aah!

04:45.286 --> 04:47.027
I'm going to die
in a flying zoo.

04:47.179 --> 04:48.770
(laughs)

04:48.831 --> 04:51.698
(groaning nervously)

04:51.792 --> 04:53.883
<i> (laughs)</i>

04:53.952 --> 04:58.422
<i> Everyone around you</i>
<i> is taking their shoes off.</i>

05:00.467 --> 05:02.375
Okay, no one is safe.
No one's sa--

05:02.469 --> 05:04.694
That-that phone
is not in airplane mode.

05:04.755 --> 05:07.455
The pilot
dresses like an alcoholic!

05:07.474 --> 05:09.699
Somebody's yelling!
Who is yelling?!

05:09.760 --> 05:12.552
Where in the name of God
is the air marshal?!

05:12.646 --> 05:14.646
(muffled shouting)

05:17.392 --> 05:18.800
(grunts)

05:18.861 --> 05:22.729
You're banned
from Air Cincinnati forever.

05:23.681 --> 05:25.824
Well, we've got to get
another flight.

05:25.975 --> 05:27.717
Uh, we can't, sir.

05:27.819 --> 05:30.737
Uh, Air Cincinnati's the only
airline that flies to Cincinnati

05:30.831 --> 05:33.239
since the demise
of Cincin-Air-Y.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.816
Well, that's just great.
That's great!

05:34.918 --> 05:36.726
In 36 hours, I have to give

05:36.745 --> 05:38.653
the most important speech
of my life.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.155
Now, how in the name
of Satan's jockstrap

05:41.258 --> 05:43.592
am I supposed to get there?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.253
Please, sir.
If you give me one last chance,

05:47.348 --> 05:49.014
I will think of nothing else
but getting you

05:49.165 --> 05:51.257
to that keynote speech on time.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.561
Nah, I'll just drive myself.

05:55.713 --> 05:57.263
(screeching)

05:57.358 --> 05:59.749
All right, where is your car?

05:59.851 --> 06:01.418
It, too, is being winterized.

06:01.478 --> 06:03.420
But I know where to get one.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.013
Oh, no.
You're not borrowing my Buick.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.033
I just had it winterized.

06:08.226 --> 06:10.685
But, Mother,
this road trip is my last chance

06:10.788 --> 06:13.763
to become friends with the man
I admire most in the world.

06:13.824 --> 06:14.856
Please.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.709
Well, you did do such a nice job

06:17.902 --> 06:19.786
re-beading my eyeglass chain.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.507

of preparing chili?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.405
You don't say, huh?

07:04.466 --> 07:06.091
-Four different ways.
-The two-way,

-chili with spaghetti.
-How about that.

07:38.074 --> 07:40.684
In the style of Shakespeare?
That seems impossible.

07:40.785 --> 07:43.110
Methinks this noble lord
doth doubt our wit.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.206
We must perform

-No, no,

-Cupholders.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.381
To grasp a cup
would seem a great ordeal.

07:55.476 --> 07:58.885
When one must keep both hands
upon the wheel.

07:59.021 --> 08:02.964
The pentameter checks out.
Your parents must be so proud.

Don't worry, Officer.

08:35.131 --> 08:36.848
It's, uh, minor damage.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.433
Nothing serious.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.188
Alas, poor Buick.
I knew it well.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.565
Oh!

Dear Lord. Our car,

08:55.527 --> 08:57.184
But the keynote. Your speech.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.778
It's all on the cards
right here.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.040

when some backwoods judge

09:02.191 --> 09:03.691

09:03.794 --> 09:08.004
All rise for the Honorable
Judge J.T. Winchester.

09:09.699 --> 09:12.125
Who dragged me in here

09:12.219 --> 09:14.127
in the middle
of my Lifetime movies?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.446
I'm missing my Lifetimes!

09:16.506 --> 09:19.874

by my very existence.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.710
Don't worry, sir. I got this.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.229
Your Honor,
permission to observe

09:24.422 --> 09:27.732
that your poor cuticles
are raw and torn.

09:27.884 --> 09:29.292
Thanks to my idiot son.

09:29.352 --> 09:32.128
He made my manicure appointment
with Tanya P.

09:32.147 --> 09:33.646
instead of Tanya G.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.816
Oh, well, that boy's

09:36.952 --> 09:38.243
Now, Mother...
