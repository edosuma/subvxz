01:07.204 --> 01:09.403
Get outta the Pride Lands,
Kiburi.

01:09.490 --> 01:13.245
It's only the Pride Lands 'cause
we haven't taken it over...

01:13.424 --> 01:14.827
Yet.

01:16.788 --> 01:19.631
You're not going
anywhere, Kiburi.

01:19.718 --> 01:21.701
Except back to the Outlands!

01:21.788 --> 01:24.276
And that goes
for your whole float!

01:29.975 --> 01:31.074
Hey, wait!

01:31.161 --> 01:32.217
Huh?

01:32.304 --> 01:34.354
Okay, I'm ready.
Bring it!

01:34.441 --> 01:35.898
Hee-yaa!

01:35.985 --> 01:37.327
Ow!

01:40.005 --> 01:41.965
Honey badger on a stick!

01:42.052 --> 01:43.622
That's hilarious!

01:43.709 --> 01:46.762
Cheezi! Quit laughin'
and start fightin'!

01:53.632 --> 01:55.950
Uhh, that's enough
for one day!

01:56.037 --> 01:57.466
Let's get outta here, fellas!

01:57.553 --> 01:59.973
Janja! Wait for us!

02:00.060 --> 02:02.085
Crocs, we're leaving.

02:02.172 --> 02:05.031
But don't worry.
We'll be back.

02:07.107 --> 02:08.277
Everyone okay?

02:08.365 --> 02:09.869
- All good.
- Affirmative.

02:09.955 --> 02:10.995
Yep.

02:11.101 --> 02:12.349
Where's Bunga?

02:12.436 --> 02:13.748
I'm here!

02:13.835 --> 02:15.782
Never felt better.

02:16.039 --> 02:17.419
What happened,
Little B?

02:17.506 --> 02:21.080
I've been, uh, working
on one of Rafiki's moves.

02:21.304 --> 02:22.557
And how did that go?

02:22.644 --> 02:23.760
Uh, great.

02:23.847 --> 02:25.783
See, I was facing off
with Cheezi...

02:25.870 --> 02:29.805
And then I did this crazy
cool move I saw Rafiki do.

02:29.892 --> 02:31.026
Hee-yaa!

02:32.537 --> 02:34.966
Well, almost did it.

02:35.425 --> 02:37.372
You sure you're okay,
Little B?

02:37.459 --> 02:39.008
Sure I'm sure.

02:39.095 --> 02:40.428
I don't know, Bunga.

02:40.515 --> 02:41.842
Looks like it hurts.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.574
Maybe you should ask Rafiki
to take a look at your back.

02:44.661 --> 02:47.347
Or give you some tips
on how to swing a stick.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.566
I'm fine. I'll just
walk it off in no time.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.603
I'm pretty sure
being able to walk

02:53.690 --> 02:56.972
is a crucial part of
the "walking it off" process.

03:00.539 --> 03:02.150
I'll save you, Kion.

03:02.237 --> 03:04.590
Easy, Bunga. It's just Jasiri.

03:05.755 --> 03:07.366
Scared you?
You wish.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.138
So, Kion. Is that how
you start every morning?

03:10.225 --> 03:13.128
Taking on crocs and hyenas
at the same time?

03:13.824 --> 03:16.020
It's starting to feel
like every morning.

03:16.107 --> 03:17.614
And every afternoon.

03:17.701 --> 03:19.444
At least there weren't
any jackals today.

03:19.531 --> 03:20.639
I've noticed.

03:20.726 --> 03:22.919
The hyenas, crocs,
jackals, vultures.

03:23.006 --> 03:25.315
They all seem to be
working together lately.

03:25.402 --> 03:26.731
What's going on, Kion?

03:26.818 --> 03:28.191
Oh, of course.

03:28.262 --> 03:29.919
You don't know about Scar!

03:29.987 --> 03:31.021
Scar?

03:32.281 --> 03:34.871
I know all about
the legend of Scar.

03:34.958 --> 03:37.495
I am a hyena after all.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.777
It's not just
a legend, Jasiri.

03:39.864 --> 03:40.942
Not anymore.

03:41.029 --> 03:42.223
Scar's back.

03:42.310 --> 03:45.249
He appears to Janja and the
others inside the volcano.

03:45.336 --> 03:47.100
He's behind these attacks.

03:47.187 --> 03:48.920
Sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

03:49.007 --> 03:51.287
Don't be. I know now.

03:51.374 --> 03:53.346
But I'll need to warn
my clan.

03:53.763 --> 03:55.025
If you want,

03:55.112 --> 03:57.819
I could ask for your clan to
stay here in the Pride Lands.

03:57.906 --> 03:59.442
Until we defeat Scar.

03:59.529 --> 04:01.587
<i>Asante,</i> Kion.
Thank you.

04:01.677 --> 04:03.572
But we can't
abandon our home.

04:03.659 --> 04:04.845
You sure?

04:04.932 --> 04:07.813
Nobody's safe in the Outlands
now that Scar's back.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.985
I think we can hold our own.

04:10.091 --> 04:13.016
Besides, I have a better idea.

04:13.247 --> 04:15.271
Scar has returned.

04:15.772 --> 04:16.851
- Oh, no!
- No.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.122
But the Lion Guard
is working to stop him.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.002
And I have a way
for us to help.

04:21.089 --> 04:23.424
Scar may know about me
and the little ones.

04:23.511 --> 04:25.527
But he doesn't know
about all of us.

04:25.614 --> 04:27.763
While the Guard is protecting
the Pride Lands,

04:27.850 --> 04:29.707
we can ruin Scar's plans here.

04:29.794 --> 04:31.020
In the Outlands.

04:31.107 --> 04:33.806
Together, we can be
a Hyena Resistance!

04:33.893 --> 04:36.124
Us? A Hyena Resistance?

04:36.211 --> 04:37.996
We can't take on Scar.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.996
I know it sounds scary.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.463
But this is our home.

04:41.550 --> 04:43.188
And we need to defend it.

04:43.275 --> 04:45.024

A hyena resistance
in the Outlands.

06:43.473 --> 06:45.777
I just hope Jasiri knows
what she's doing.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.173
You kidding, Fuli?

06:47.260 --> 06:49.792
She's un-Bunga-lieva...
Ow!

06:49.879 --> 06:52.121
Bunga, are you sure
you're okay?

06:52.817 --> 06:55.718
Who? Me?
Of course! I'm fine.

06:56.918 --> 06:59.484
Okay, okay.
I'll go see Rafiki.

06:59.571 --> 07:02.169
But only to ask him
how to swing this stick.

07:03.479 --> 07:04.812
Ow!

07:05.054 --> 07:07.591
Yes.
You do have a problem.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.239
That's what I said.

07:09.326 --> 07:11.544
Every time I swing the thing,

07:11.631 --> 07:13.675
I hit my face and fall over.

07:13.762 --> 07:16.239
You have much spirit,
honey badger.

07:16.326 --> 07:17.479
Thanks, Rafiki.

07:17.566 --> 07:19.640
But, your form
is horrible.

07:19.727 --> 07:21.437
My form?

07:21.614 --> 07:24.083
Ooh! That's better.

07:25.855 --> 07:28.687
Hey, does this mean
my form's better too?

07:29.148 --> 07:30.189
No, no.

07:30.276 --> 07:33.202
Form cannot be
so easily fixed.

07:33.289 --> 07:35.185
You must learn balance,

07:35.272 --> 07:36.701
and technique.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.670
Come. And watch closely.

07:44.434 --> 07:46.393
Backward Baboon Bend.

07:46.461 --> 07:47.518
Go!

07:58.148 --> 08:00.927
No! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

08:02.152 --> 08:03.982
Spinning Scorpion Sweep.

08:04.069 --> 08:05.966
One of my favorites.

08:12.182 --> 08:14.356
Prancing Porcupine Pose.

08:14.443 --> 08:15.497
Go!

08:18.327 --> 08:19.400
Yes!

08:19.487 --> 08:21.474
Prance, honey badger! Prance!

08:24.099 --> 08:26.029
Hey! I'm good at this one.

08:26.311 --> 08:27.568
Woah!

08:28.619 --> 08:30.288
You know what Rafiki?

08:30.375 --> 08:33.553
I better go see
if the Guard needs me.

08:34.484 --> 08:36.438
Remember, young honey badger.

08:36.525 --> 08:37.647
Practice.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.615
The key to good form
is to stick with it.

08:40.729 --> 08:44.553
Yeah, yeah. Okay Rafiki.
I'll stick with it.

08:45.322 --> 08:47.210
Oh, I get it.

08:47.297 --> 08:48.611
Stick with it.

08:48.698 --> 08:50.795
'Cause I've got a stick.

08:51.385 --> 08:52.385
Ow!

08:52.795 --> 08:54.223
Listen up, fur brains.

08:54.310 --> 08:57.817
I just got Scar's new plan to take
over more of the Pride Lands.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.264
This time it's Mizimu Grove.

09:00.361 --> 09:03.160
He wants us to attack
from three sides.

09:03.247 --> 09:05.108
The jackals will take
the left side,

09:05.195 --> 09:06.833
and the crocodiles, the right.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.127
And, as Scar's favorites,

09:09.337 --> 09:11.381
we will take the middle.

09:11.971 --> 09:13.634
A three sided attack?

09:13.721 --> 09:16.490
The Hyena Resistance
will see about that.

09:18.306 --> 09:19.861
Go warn the Lion Guard, Madoa.

09:19.948 --> 09:21.374
I'll get everyone ready here.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.420
I'll be back
before you know it.

09:23.674 --> 09:24.928
All right, everyone.

09:25.015 --> 09:27.450
Our first mission
as Hyena Resistance.

09:27.537 --> 09:30.834
We're going to stop Janja's clan
before they reach Mizimu Grove.

09:30.921 --> 09:32.787
And here's how we'll do it.

09:33.724 --> 09:35.469
I've really got it this time.

09:35.556 --> 09:37.818
Backward Baboon Bend.

09:38.456 --> 09:40.218
Lion Guard! Lion Guard!

09:43.494 --> 09:44.555
Madoa.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.351
News from the Resistance?

09:46.438 --> 09:48.825
Yeah! Jasiri overheard
Janja talking.

09:48.912 --> 09:52.212
Scar's sending a three sided
attack to Mizimu Grove.

09:52.299 --> 09:54.272
He must be planning
to take it over.

09:54.359 --> 09:55.679
Just like Kilio Valley.

09:55.766 --> 09:57.556
But Jasiri has her own plan.

09:57.643 --> 09:59.564
We're going
to stop Janja's clan

09:59.651 --> 10:01.649
before they ever
leave the Outlands.

10:01.736 --> 10:04.461
That still leaves, one...

10:04.548 --> 10:06.210
And two sides for us.

10:06.297 --> 10:07.866
I was gettin' there.

10:07.953 --> 10:09.525
Two sides for us.

10:09.612 --> 10:11.691
Right.
The jackals and the crocs.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.408
Okay. Thanks, Madoa.

10:13.476 --> 10:14.494
No problem.

10:14.562 --> 10:16.546
Now I should get back
to help Jasiri.

10:16.633 --> 10:17.781
Good luck.

10:19.547 --> 10:20.882
Come on, boys.

10:20.969 --> 10:25.928
We'll show those jackals and crocs
how us hyenas get things done.

10:48.404 --> 10:50.075
Uh, Janja?

10:50.162 --> 10:53.212
Is this how us hyenas
get things done?

10:53.693 --> 10:55.059
No, fur brains.

10:55.146 --> 10:58.521
This is how hyenas
don't get things done.

10:58.608 --> 10:59.985
Now, come on.

11:01.818 --> 11:05.056
Actually, it's how good hyenas
get things done.

11:05.255 --> 11:07.329
Ono? Any sign of them yet?

11:07.603 --> 11:08.927
Not yet.

11:09.094 --> 11:10.159
Wait!

11:11.367 --> 11:13.346
I see Reirei
and the jackals.

11:13.433 --> 11:14.842
And Kiburi's float.

11:14.929 --> 11:16.841
It's just like Madoa said.

11:16.928 --> 11:19.028
Okay. Bunga and Beshte,

11:19.115 --> 11:20.450
you take the jackals.

11:20.537 --> 11:22.458
Fuli, Ono, you're with me.

11:22.545 --> 11:24.059
Till the Pride Lands end...

11:24.146 --> 11:26.219
Lion Guard defend!

11:30.045 --> 11:31.716
Stop right there, crocs.

11:32.810 --> 11:35.637
You keep forgetting where
the Outlands end, Kiburi.

11:35.724 --> 11:37.140
Just you wait, cub.

11:37.227 --> 11:41.476
Soon the Outlands will stretch
all the way to Pride Rock.

11:52.361 --> 11:53.509
Hey, Goigoi.

11:53.596 --> 11:55.827
I've got something for you.

11:55.914 --> 11:57.483
For me? What is it?

11:57.570 --> 12:00.691
Prancing Porcupine Pose.

12:02.886 --> 12:04.140
Wow!

12:04.227 --> 12:06.141
Teach me. Teach me.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.372
Goigoi. What're you doing?

12:08.459 --> 12:09.469
Get 'em!

12:09.537 --> 12:11.223
You got it, pumpkin paws.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.474
I don't think so.

12:12.561 --> 12:14.291
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

12:18.582 --> 12:20.972
The Lion Guard
is too much for us.

12:21.059 --> 12:23.518
This was supposed to be
a three sided attack.

12:23.605 --> 12:27.937
Yes. We need to tell Scar Janja
and his hyenas never showed.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.619
Come on, boys.

12:37.921 --> 12:39.963
Back so soon, Janja?

12:40.279 --> 12:44.739
Am I to assume that's because you've
defeated the Lion Guard easily?

12:44.826 --> 12:45.942
Not exactly.

12:46.029 --> 12:49.472
We, uh, didn't make it
to the Pride Lands.

12:49.559 --> 12:53.517
We were on our way,
but there was a rock slide.

12:53.636 --> 12:55.142
A rock slide?

12:55.524 --> 13:00.464
You let a measly
rock slide stop you?

13:00.551 --> 13:03.283
It was a pretty big
rock slide?

13:07.529 --> 13:12.830
I do hope you have
better news than Janja.

13:12.967 --> 13:15.203
Without the hyenas,
the plan was ruined.

13:15.290 --> 13:19.074
The Guard forced us out before
we even got to Mizimu Grove

13:19.161 --> 13:23.044
And here I thought
crocs were the best fighters.

13:23.131 --> 13:25.435
We crocs can fight just fine.

13:25.522 --> 13:28.463
But when things don't go
according to plan...

13:30.040 --> 13:33.595
It was just a bit
of bad luck, Scar. Really!

13:33.810 --> 13:37.850
Very well. We will try again.

13:38.264 --> 13:39.591
But this time,

13:39.678 --> 13:42.630
Kiburi and his float
will take the lead.

13:42.717 --> 13:46.392
Attacking Big Springs.

13:47.757 --> 13:50.286
Scar wants us to try again.

13:50.373 --> 13:51.674
But this time,

13:51.761 --> 13:54.363
we crocodiles
will take the lead.

13:54.450 --> 13:55.935
So, who's ready?

13:56.084 --> 13:57.888
Yeah!

13:58.865 --> 14:02.330
Then the Hyena Resistance
will be ready, too.

14:09.177 --> 14:10.488
You hear that?

14:16.630 --> 14:20.256
You let the Lion Guard
stop you again?

14:21.124 --> 14:22.424
Reirei.

14:22.582 --> 14:26.764
I trust the jackals
can do better.

14:28.483 --> 14:29.799
Listen up everyone.

14:29.886 --> 14:31.205
Scar ain't happy.

14:31.292 --> 14:34.397
Both Kiburi and Janja
have messed up his plans.

14:34.484 --> 14:37.264
But now it's our turn
to take the lead.

14:39.042 --> 14:41.181
We're gonna to take over
Ukuni Woods.

14:41.268 --> 14:43.316
And ain't nothing
gonna stop us.

14:47.607 --> 14:48.937
What?

14:57.227 --> 15:00.037
And this time, stay out!

15:00.635 --> 15:01.811
Oh!

15:05.503 --> 15:06.807
Jasiri.

15:07.417 --> 15:10.200
Looks like the Hyena
Resistance is a success.

15:10.287 --> 15:12.744
Yes. I can't thank you enough.

15:12.831 --> 15:14.490
No need to thank us, Kion.

15:14.577 --> 15:16.357
We're all in this
together now.

15:16.444 --> 15:19.627
Actually, it's kinda fun
messing up Scar's plans.

15:23.654 --> 15:24.899
Skinks!

15:24.986 --> 15:27.068
What news do you have?

15:27.155 --> 15:29.928
It's that hyena. Jasiri.

15:30.073 --> 15:33.209
She and her whole clan have been
working with the Lion Guard.

15:33.296 --> 15:35.328
They've been
messin' up your attacks.

15:35.415 --> 15:38.512
They call it
the Hyena Resistance.

15:39.965 --> 15:41.253
Janja?

15:41.596 --> 15:45.436
I thought you said
you took care of that hyena.

15:45.729 --> 15:49.030
Yeah, I might have not
told you the whole story.

15:49.117 --> 15:54.319
As I recall, you said she and
some cubs fell in a steam vent.

15:54.484 --> 15:56.303
Was there more?

15:56.440 --> 15:57.569
Oh, uh,

15:57.672 --> 15:59.322
did I forget
to mention the part

15:59.409 --> 16:01.726
where the Lion Guard
showed up and saved 'em?

16:01.813 --> 16:03.009
Yes.

16:03.096 --> 16:07.842
You did forget to mention
that little detail.

16:08.909 --> 16:10.260
Oh.

16:10.471 --> 16:12.951
But now you can
make up for it.

16:13.469 --> 16:16.877
Take care of her and her clan.

16:16.964 --> 16:18.873
Oh, uh, sure, sure.

16:19.455 --> 16:21.055
How were you thinking I...

16:21.142 --> 16:22.748
By playing her own game!

16:22.964 --> 16:28.392
Go tell your clan that the plan
is to attack Mizimu Grove again.

16:28.479 --> 16:31.642
Then, while the Guard
is waiting in Mizimu Grove,

16:31.729 --> 16:35.022
you'll surround Jasiri's clan.

16:35.370 --> 16:40.181
But how're we gonna surround
Jasiri if we were in Mizimu Grove?

16:40.268 --> 16:43.986
You won't be in Mizimu Grove.

16:44.073 --> 16:48.030
The plan is to make
the Hyena Resistance think

16:48.203 --> 16:51.525
you're going to be
in Mizimu Grove.

16:51.612 --> 16:55.695
Oh! But instead we'll
go after Jasiri and her clan.

16:55.773 --> 16:56.790
Correct!

16:56.867 --> 17:00.940
And, you'll take the jackals
and crocs with you.

17:01.027 --> 17:03.665
Okay. You got it, Scar.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.992
And Janja?

17:08.358 --> 17:11.063
Don't disappoint me,

17:11.271 --> 17:12.789
again.

17:15.098 --> 17:18.991
And then Jasiri heard Janja say it
would be their biggest attack yet.

17:19.078 --> 17:20.663
Thanks for the warning Madoa.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.083
And thank Jasiri, too.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.175
Of course. See you next time.

17:26.608 --> 17:28.218
Well, here we go again.

17:28.305 --> 17:30.691
Come on,
back to Mizimu Grove.

17:38.737 --> 17:41.272
Madoa, how'd it go
with the Guard?

17:41.359 --> 17:44.300
Great. They're waiting
for Reirei and Kiburi now.

17:44.387 --> 17:45.683
Oh, are they?

17:47.039 --> 17:48.743
We'd hate
to keep them waiting.

17:50.478 --> 17:51.794
That's right.

17:51.874 --> 17:53.565
Going somewhere?

17:59.613 --> 18:02.096
It sure is taking them
a long time to get here.

18:02.183 --> 18:03.739
Are we sure they're coming?

18:03.826 --> 18:07.962
Maybe they heard about my unstoppable
move and decided not to come.

18:08.049 --> 18:10.022
Somehow, I doubt it.

18:10.109 --> 18:11.920
Ono? See what you can see.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.284
Affirmative.

18:16.326 --> 18:17.436
<i> Hapana.</i>

18:17.523 --> 18:19.801
The hyenas,
jackals, and crocs...

18:19.888 --> 18:21.678
They're not after
Mizimu Grove.

18:21.765 --> 18:23.348
They're after Jasiri's clan.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.012
And they have them surrounded!

18:25.099 --> 18:26.233
We better hurry.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.754
Till the Pride Lands end...

18:27.841 --> 18:30.214
Lion Guard defend!

18:32.141 --> 18:35.371
So, did Scar come up
with this little scheme, too?

18:35.458 --> 18:36.955
You know about Scar?

18:37.042 --> 18:38.882
Who cares?

18:39.115 --> 18:42.246
Your days of spying
for the Lion Guard are over.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.106
So very over.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.089
That's close enough.

18:47.218 --> 18:50.139
Now back off of Jasiri's clan.

18:50.226 --> 18:51.741
Nice try, Kion.

18:51.828 --> 18:55.444
But even you can't save
the Hyena Resistance now.

18:55.531 --> 18:57.194
We got 'em surrounded.

18:57.281 --> 18:59.276
And we have you surrounded.

18:59.363 --> 19:01.508
Hiya, croccidy-crocs.

19:01.947 --> 19:04.485
Surprised to see us,
Reirei?

19:05.975 --> 19:07.226
Now!

19:13.361 --> 19:15.706
Nice birdie, nice birdie.

19:19.282 --> 19:21.471
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

19:21.558 --> 19:23.170
Hippo!

19:25.886 --> 19:27.136
Ow!

19:28.231 --> 19:30.272
You're mine, honey badger.

19:40.243 --> 19:43.791
Let me show you
how a real hyena fights.

19:51.354 --> 19:52.736
We need to regroup.

19:54.448 --> 19:56.103
You need to leave.

19:56.190 --> 19:57.730
Not this time.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.175
That's right.

19:59.262 --> 20:00.892
We're not going back to Scar

20:00.979 --> 20:03.280
without defeating
the Hyena Resistance.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.100
We'll see about that.

20:12.159 --> 20:13.710
Woah!

20:13.797 --> 20:15.456
- Wow!
- Yeah!

20:15.543 --> 20:16.691
You did it!

20:16.778 --> 20:18.057
We did it.

20:18.174 --> 20:19.491
Little help here?

20:21.452 --> 20:22.718
Janja?

20:31.284 --> 20:32.656
Why?

20:32.859 --> 20:34.526
Why did you help me?

20:34.613 --> 20:37.003
I'd help any hyena, Janja.

20:37.090 --> 20:38.980
<i>Sisi Ni Sawa.</i>

20:40.403 --> 20:41.913
We're the same?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.952
You and your clan don't have
to be on Scar's side, Janja.

20:46.039 --> 20:47.334
You could join us.

20:47.421 --> 20:48.949
The Hyena Resistance,

20:49.036 --> 20:50.675
and help defeat him.

20:50.787 --> 20:52.937
Hmm, uh,

20:53.226 --> 20:54.561
I don't think so.

20:54.648 --> 20:56.675
We ain't the same Jasiri.

20:57.073 --> 20:58.351
We'll see.

20:59.483 --> 21:03.571
Ha! For a second I thought
Janja was gonna join up with them.

21:03.658 --> 21:04.726
Yes.

21:04.820 --> 21:08.057
Scar will wanna hear
about Janja's hesitation.

21:09.855 --> 21:12.362
I can't wait to tell him.

21:12.687 --> 21:15.637
You're all still welcome to
come stay in the Pride Lands.

21:15.724 --> 21:18.006
Scar knows about
your whole clan now.

21:18.093 --> 21:19.762
He'll come after you again.

21:19.849 --> 21:21.420
I know, Kion.

21:21.507 --> 21:23.663
But the Outlands
are still our home.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.276
That hasn't changed.

21:25.398 --> 21:26.960
<i>Kwetu Ni Kwetu?</i>

21:27.047 --> 21:28.438
Home is home.

21:29.435 --> 21:30.664
Besides,

21:30.751 --> 21:33.675
Scar can't do anything
to us if he can't find us.

21:35.265 --> 21:36.571
Think they'll be okay?

21:36.658 --> 21:37.881
This is their home.

21:37.968 --> 21:39.942
Jasiri knows it
better than anyone.
