WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:03.836
Previously on Justified...

00:03.921 --> 00:05.922
- What is that?
- It's a driver's license.

00:06.048 --> 00:08.424
First name, Waldo. Last name, Truth.

00:08.592 --> 00:11.386
Just put that bag
back in the wall and forget about it.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.845
I didn't say it was in the wall.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.597
That your son, the Marshal, came to see you?

00:14.723 --> 00:15.848
- Why?
- Because I heard about

00:15.933 --> 00:17.225
a bag like that once before.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.853
Well, what brings you to Harlan County?

00:20.938 --> 00:22.021
Boyd Crowder.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.107
I need a little outside help,

00:24.233 --> 00:25.566
someone I can trust.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.110
This is a job interview now?

00:27.236 --> 00:28.361
It's a job.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.946
Oh, my God. Is this real?

00:30.072 --> 00:33.199
It's from a church.
Got some religious screed on the other side.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.285
Now, I see a lot of new faces here today.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.454
How about you? Yes, you.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.459
God damn.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.961
Yeah.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.963
We're getting good at that.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.549
Getting?

00:50.926 --> 00:53.052
You ever hear the expression

00:53.804 --> 00:56.973
"A woman needs a reason.
All a man needs is a place"?

00:57.099 --> 00:59.475
I would argue that everyone needs a place.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.728
I might argue that you're missing the point.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.480
No, I think I understand.

01:05.441 --> 01:08.651
I'm afraid
I have to stop you right there, cowboy,

01:08.777 --> 01:10.486
not that I don't appreciate the thought.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.904
Where are you going?

01:12.322 --> 01:14.407
Well, I know
it's not as pressing as catching a fugitive,

01:14.491 --> 01:16.743
but a bar without booze is a sad place.

01:17.786 --> 01:18.828
I'll do it.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.249
You want to handle the bar deliveries?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.251
How hard could it be?

01:26.462 --> 01:28.171
I know you weren't trying to be insulting,

01:28.297 --> 01:30.006
so I'm just gonna let that one slide.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.258
I want you to stay right there,

01:32.968 --> 01:34.427
just like that.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.688
Whatever it is, go ahead and bring it on in.
I'll sign for it.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.273
I ain't got a delivery.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.817
In that case, sorry, buddy. We are closed.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.110
That's cool.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.737
I'm just gonna get myself a beer.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.199
That's funny. I thought I just said...

01:56.408 --> 01:57.533
You work here?

01:58.368 --> 01:59.494
Actually, no.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.496
But you're taking deliveries.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.706
Just trying to do a favour for a friend.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.583
That must be one hell of a friend.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.001
She is.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.128
I get it. Is that the blonde or the brunette?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.465
Is that why you're here?

02:12.549 --> 02:14.217
Man, maybe I'm just here for a beer.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.887
Don't be embarrassed.
That's why most guys come here.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.556
Who are you, man?

02:21.016 --> 02:24.310
I'm Raylan.
I'm the guy telling you it's time to go.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.063
You think you could make me?

02:28.023 --> 02:29.065
Really?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.900
I'm probably gonna walk out that door,

02:31.026 --> 02:33.361
but, if I don't,
do you think you could make me?

02:35.572 --> 02:38.491
I don't know, and I'd rather not find out.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.416
Okay, man. It's cool.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.085
I'm just messing with you.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.670
Okay.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.933
Why would I order two more
cases of that shit?

03:04.059 --> 03:06.269
I got three I can't move as it is.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.145
Go on. Get it out of here.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.899
Hey, tell Shelly to call me when she gets in.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.698
What happened to you last night?

03:18.782 --> 03:20.741
It's bad enough
you're shooting the customers.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.951
Then you no-show?

03:22.286 --> 03:23.953
Sorry. I wasn't feeling well.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.914
You're not leaving me
with a lot of options here, Ellen May.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.084
I lied, Ava.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.669
I was feeling fine.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.841
Actually, I never felt better in my whole life.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.677
I wrote this down so I wouldn't forget.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.015
"My soul finds rest in God alone.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.309
"My salvation comes from him."

03:47.144 --> 03:49.812
That's from palms, number 62.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.314
You mean Psalms.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.483
You found God?

03:54.818 --> 03:56.444
That's what this is?

03:56.528 --> 04:00.156
I need to save my soul, Ava,
before it's too late.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.283
I saved your soul.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
Remember?

04:04.286 --> 04:07.538
Not God or Jesus Christ,
me and my shotgun.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.498
I know. That's why I'm here.

04:10.167 --> 04:14.003
I was just gonna leave,
but I wanted to come and return the favour.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.755
Excuse me?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.673
See, Billy says it's never too late

04:19.176 --> 04:20.635
to live a righteous life.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.678
"Billy says"?

04:22.804 --> 04:26.182
He says that we control our destiny,

04:26.850 --> 04:29.977
and God will forgive us if we just...

04:30.812 --> 04:32.521
If we just change our ways.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.148
You're a whore, Ellen May.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.694
And if that ain't enough,
you and me, we killed a man.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.572
We dumped his body
down a mine shaft without ceremony.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.533
There ain't no salvation for people like us.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.078
Johnny, stay.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.830
We're just about done.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.709
Come here.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.216
You will be back at work tonight,

05:00.884 --> 05:02.843
or you won't ever set foot in this place again.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.763
We clear?

05:07.057 --> 05:08.224
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.563
Pappy Van Winkle. Holy shit.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.273
What's the occasion?

05:16.775 --> 05:19.694
Well, from what I understand,
you're about to have a birthday.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.154
Actually, I turned 56 last Thursday.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.447
Well, there you go.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.116
Happy belated birthday.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.784
You didn't know that?

05:27.285 --> 05:29.078
Have a seat. I appreciate the gesture.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.538
It's nothing.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.915
- How's Leslie?
- She's good.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.418
Talking about buying an Airstream now.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.586
- Could be fun.
- Oh, yeah.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.880
Lots of time together in a close space,

05:39.965 --> 05:41.424
that'd be good for the marriage.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.217
How's life in Bowling Green?

05:43.301 --> 05:45.720
More arrests than any office our size,

05:46.263 --> 05:49.640
under budget every year,
almost no incidences.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.018
Of course you don't have any incidences.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.061
'Cause all your fugitives are pussies.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.897
A fugitive is a fugitive.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.107
Shit.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.444
I bet I got Marshals
that are more trouble than your fugitives.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.653
Come on, Art.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.363
No, you came here about the job, right?

06:04.448 --> 06:05.781
You need to hear about this.

06:06.825 --> 06:10.453
I got a young kid here,
decorated sniper in Iraq war,

06:11.329 --> 06:14.165
Army Ranger,
I don't know how many kills he had,

06:14.458 --> 06:16.125
always looking to kill somebody else,

06:16.460 --> 06:19.128
probably got PTSD, probably an alcoholic.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.298
Not a matter of
if that powder keg is gonna blow but when.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.300
I got a lady Marshal here.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.553
Brought in two of the top
15 fugitives to this office,

06:27.637 --> 06:29.805
but she's always trying to prove herself.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.850
I thought she was gonna be the one
that would take this office over

06:32.976 --> 06:35.978
after I got ready to retire,
but now she's left her husband.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.398
So, it's gonna be fun to monitor her
emotional state over the next year

06:39.483 --> 06:40.900
see if she can keep it together.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.986
Then I got a local boy,
born in Harlan County,

06:44.112 --> 06:45.613
been investigated so many times,

06:45.697 --> 06:47.990
Internal Affairs has got him on speed dial.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.326
Father's in prison for murdering two people,

06:50.452 --> 06:51.744
including a state trooper,

06:51.828 --> 06:54.080
and his daddy
killed somebody else last night in prison,

06:54.164 --> 06:56.165
and I get to be the one to tell him about it.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.167
Unless you'd like to stick around and do it.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.585
I mean, the key to it's just to talk about it

06:59.669 --> 07:01.045
like you're talking about the weather.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.671
Don't get all emotional and shit.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.513
That's a $200 bottle of bourbon, Art.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.349
I intend to enjoy every drop of it, Patrick.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.518
Thanks for stopping by.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.223
When?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.560
Last night. Right after lockdown.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.146
He's been questioned?

08:00.397 --> 08:02.064
Apparently, he didn't have much to say.

08:02.983 --> 08:03.983
Who did he kill, again?

08:04.067 --> 08:07.069
Sam Porter. Dixie Mafia thug,

08:07.154 --> 08:10.531
served eight years
of a 10-year stint for attempted murder,

08:11.241 --> 08:12.324
Trustee with the prison.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.492
I know this dude.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.578
- You do?
- He was in the room last night

08:15.662 --> 08:17.163
when I showed Arlo the bag.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.000
What bag?

08:21.084 --> 08:23.085
The bag I showed him last night.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.590
Raylan, on a scale from one to a shit load,

08:27.674 --> 08:29.842
how much do you need to tell me right now?

08:31.344 --> 08:34.054
So, Arlo didn't
say anything about the ID or the bag?

08:34.222 --> 08:36.765
Just got him
to admit he knew it was hidden in the wall.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.101
Why would your father do that?

08:39.436 --> 08:42.354
Why would he hide
a Panamanian diplomatic bag in the wall

08:42.438 --> 08:44.857
or murder someone
for just laying eyes on it?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.108
Either. Both.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.570
You could ask him.
I get the feeling he ain't gonna say much.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.697
Well, then, maybe we need to ask him.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.116
Waldo Truth.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.452
It could be a coincidence.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.287
One dealer gets turned, I might buy that.

08:58.413 --> 09:02.249
But a dealer and a hooker? No, that feels like
we got a target on our backs.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.793
Did Ellen May
say how she came to be acquainted

09:04.920 --> 09:07.129
with our new friend,
Preacher Billy and his sister?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.380
No.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.258
But whatever he said to her,
she is mighty convinced.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.469
Why don't we take a drive over there

09:13.553 --> 09:15.137
and see what this kid's got to say?

09:16.473 --> 09:18.432
This church is a nuisance and nothing more.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.142
I can go alone if you want.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.394
What I want is for you to find out

09:22.479 --> 09:24.772
why our sales have dropped off.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.149
Like I asked you to do, Johnny.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.151
This church is the reason.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.320
People in Harlan County
still party on Friday and Saturday night

09:31.446 --> 09:32.947
and get saved on Sunday morning.

09:34.449 --> 09:37.493
Now, is there anything
else you want to discuss, or are you good?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.745
Johnny?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.122
I'm good.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.963
Little rough on him.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.507
Nuisance or worse,

09:51.841 --> 09:54.677
it's not a bad idea going down there to see
what this church is all about.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.095
I don't like churches, Ava.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.764
Okay.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.851
Close that door.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.355
Extortion, evading arrest,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.899
assault with deadly weapon,
grand theft auto,

10:08.984 --> 10:10.651
extortion count two,

10:10.986 --> 10:13.821
D&D, B&E, DMZ...

10:14.239 --> 10:15.322
DMZ?

10:15.407 --> 10:16.699
Making sure you're still paying attention.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.450
All that just for one family?

10:18.535 --> 10:21.412
No, that's actually all just Jud Truth,
Waldo's oldest,

10:21.496 --> 10:23.872
but the rest of them are
all similarly decorated.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.457
Grandson Milo is 13.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.086
He spent three months
in juvie last year for pissing on a cop.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.213
Jesus. Are you sure
you want to go with us, Art?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.800
He's got a point, boss.
I mean, hell, their dog's in the pound.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.387
You know the best
barbecue I ever had was in Versailles?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.889
That's where Waldo is.
I don't want to miss out on that brisket.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.976
Why don't you tell us why you're going?

10:44.936 --> 10:47.313
Of all the fugitives
that have come across our desk of late,

10:47.397 --> 10:48.981
why you got to go on this one?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.942
Because for 30 years, this office

10:52.360 --> 10:54.111
dropped the ball on apprehending

10:54.195 --> 10:56.989
a federal fugitive
that was collecting a draw cheque.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.658
And I, personally, want to be the one
to cross that off the books.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.994
- Is that what it is?
- That's what it is.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.497
And also that mystery-bag thing's giving me
a little bit of a Marshal stiffy.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.832
That's a nice image.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.251
Any other questions or concerns here?

11:11.046 --> 11:12.171
Are you driving?

11:12.255 --> 11:14.131
No. Boss doesn't drive,

11:14.215 --> 11:16.717
unless he wants to, and I don't want to.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.094
But we are gonna
stop for lunch before we get to the Truths'

11:19.179 --> 11:21.889
in case you shoot one of them.
Then we won't get to go after.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.561
Okay.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.988
We watch them for a few hours every day.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.491
Allow their parents to go to job interviews,

11:40.575 --> 11:44.203
run a few errands, take a few minutes
alone, if that's what they need.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.788
That's so nice of you.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.082
Yeah, well, we, ourselves, believe

11:48.166 --> 11:50.417
that what we're doing is
just a drop in the ocean,

11:50.502 --> 11:53.379
but the ocean will be less
because of that missing drop.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.546
I'm Cassie.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.340
I'm Ellen May.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.342
Yeah. I remember you from last night.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.803
Is there something we can do for you?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.971
I was hoping... Is Billy around?

12:03.681 --> 12:05.224
I'm afraid he's busy.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.059
Okay.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.685
Maybe there's something I can do.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.272
No. I think I just really need to talk to Billy.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.316
Well, you can always try back later.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.111
I thought I heard your voice.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.154
It's nice to see you again.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.698
I don't mean to be a bother.

12:21.783 --> 12:24.034
Nonsense. No, I needed the break.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.953
Well, I'll leave you two alone.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.663
- Ellen May.
- Bye.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.542
Surprised to see you here again so soon.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.627
So, what is it I can do for you?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.298
Well, I just wanted to say...

12:39.259 --> 12:42.803
How much I appreciate
your taking an interest in me.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.893
But I don't think
I can be a part of your church.

12:51.146 --> 12:54.481
If I may ask, what has turned you
so quickly away from us?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.358
Sit.

12:58.570 --> 13:02.573
Well, I know how you said that

13:02.657 --> 13:04.158
God loves everybody.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.492
Yes, he does.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.036
And that Jesus forgives us our sins

13:08.663 --> 13:11.331
if we just embrace him into our hearts.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.628
I did some terrible things, Billy.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.047
- Ellen May...
- No, I mean...

13:19.299 --> 13:22.426
Like unspeakable, awful things.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.761
Things that...

13:25.054 --> 13:27.723
Things that nobody could ever forgive.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.478
It's not true.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.150
None among us are without sin.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.904
The severity of your transgressions

13:41.988 --> 13:45.240
pales in comparison
to your commitment to salvation,

13:45.533 --> 13:47.451
the good you do going forward.

13:48.870 --> 13:53.207
"For God sent not his son into the world
to condemn the world,

13:54.751 --> 13:58.837
"but so that the world,
through him, might be saved."

14:01.341 --> 14:02.424
That's real pretty.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.844
But I thought that...

14:08.640 --> 14:11.308
That some people just can't be saved,

14:11.809 --> 14:13.477
no matter what.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.813
Who planted that seed in your mind?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.360
Is it those for whom you have
compromised yourself?

14:21.444 --> 14:24.738
They done good things for me, too.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.824
- They are trying to shame you, Ellen May.
- No.

14:27.909 --> 14:31.828
Shame you into believing
you are less than the beautiful,

14:31.913 --> 14:33.539
special creature that you are,

14:33.623 --> 14:36.458
and they do so
out of their own fear and greed.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.171
Come here.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.549
Now, listen to me.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.760
Do you want to be a part of this?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.388
More than...

14:50.348 --> 14:52.975
More than anything in the world.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.104
Then it will be so.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.607
And we will shame those
who attempt to poison your mind

15:00.692 --> 15:02.192
with guilt and sadness,

15:02.277 --> 15:04.611
and you will know

15:04.696 --> 15:07.030
what true peace and happiness can be.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.800
Let's do this!

16:08.635 --> 16:10.594
God damn, man. Quit that shit.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.971
Well, stop trying to stand up,
I'll stop hitting you.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.434
Shit.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.644
He keeps trying to stand up.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.354
Any reason why he shouldn't?

16:20.438 --> 16:21.938
On my last tour,

16:23.441 --> 16:27.319
so, they transfer me
from Iraq to Bagram air base in Afghanistan.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.696
- Much prettier than I expected.
- Really?

16:29.781 --> 16:31.323
Man. They got poppy fields,

16:31.407 --> 16:33.116
got snow-capped mountains
in the wintertime.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.911
- It's beautiful.
- Hey, that's an awful nice story, but what...

16:36.079 --> 16:37.913
It is rude to interrupt people, Danny.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.581
Don't you think?

16:41.417 --> 16:42.751
Don't do that again.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.253
- Where was I?
- Snow-capped mountains.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.339
Doesn't really matter. Besides all that,

16:47.423 --> 16:49.216
mostly the same shit, you know?

16:49.300 --> 16:50.967
A lot of guys, a few years in,

16:51.094 --> 16:52.636
looking for ways to cope,

16:52.762 --> 16:54.096
but what they can find in Afghanistan

16:54.180 --> 16:56.098
that they did not find in Iraq...

16:56.808 --> 16:58.433
- Heroin.
- Really?

16:58.601 --> 17:00.811
After a while,
I can spot a doper from 100 yards away

17:00.937 --> 17:02.104
just by the hitch in his step.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.315
So, when I spot Danny here

17:05.942 --> 17:08.443
lurking around Audrey's place,

17:08.778 --> 17:11.279
I take a chance. I shake him down.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.492
You were right.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.454
Church ain't your only problem.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.959
You selling heroin in my backyard, son.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.877
When my people hear about this,

17:26.963 --> 17:28.672
you two is gonna wish you was dead.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.340
Well, maybe I got a death wish,

17:30.466 --> 17:32.634
but I'd like to talk to your people.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.386
You got a phone number?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.555
Hey. Address.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.890
- Frankfort.
- Frankfort?

17:38.975 --> 17:40.142
Boyd!

17:43.980 --> 17:45.480
You got to come see this.

17:47.650 --> 17:51.820
Yes, we'll gather at the river

17:52.155 --> 17:56.491
The beautiful, the beautiful river

17:56.909 --> 18:00.746
Gather with the saints at the river

18:00.830 --> 18:04.916
That flows by the throne of God

18:10.673 --> 18:12.215
Now, that's a pretty nameplate.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.426
Well, I always feel that

18:14.510 --> 18:16.970
this office and me have
been a pretty good fit.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.972
Why, you nervous, Shelby?

18:19.056 --> 18:21.600
'Cause we're way past the point
of guilty by association.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.727
Why don't you have a seat?

18:25.855 --> 18:27.731
Did you have any luck
looking into that church?

18:27.857 --> 18:31.485
Do you happen to recall a phone
conversation we had a few months back?

18:31.569 --> 18:34.696
I believe we had a couple
of phone conversations a few months back.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.657
The one where I expressed my opinion
that we were square.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.202
Well, now, Shelby, I thought we were a circle.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.080
I can't be part of your
business any more, Boyd.

18:44.207 --> 18:47.334
I will turn my head as far as I can
without breaking my neck,

18:47.418 --> 18:48.877
but this can't continue.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.838
Well, Shelby,
don't think of this as a nefarious interaction

18:51.923 --> 18:54.883
so much as a concerned
citizen reaching out to his sheriff

18:54.967 --> 18:57.719
in an attempt to
protect the good people of Harlan County.

18:57.887 --> 19:01.139
Now, I believe
we might have a cult in our midst.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.437
If I give you this, we're done.

19:07.897 --> 19:11.817
No slips of the mind,
no "one more favour." Done.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.902
Whatever you say, Shelby.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.077
Billy and his sister
been in five cities in three years,

19:22.245 --> 19:25.914
each one more desperate
and beaten-down than the last.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.999
They set up shop,

19:28.084 --> 19:30.252
recruit locals, preach their gospel,

19:30.336 --> 19:32.504
and then, after a few months,
they move along.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.589
No trouble with the law as far as I could find.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.885
So Billy and his sister
move into a town in its time of need,

19:38.970 --> 19:41.179
chip away at the
criminal element's enterprise

19:41.264 --> 19:43.431
till they got no choice but to pay them off.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.017
Harlan is far from thriving,

19:46.102 --> 19:49.896
and folks pouring what little they got
into drugs and whores

19:49.981 --> 19:51.815
ain't gonna get it back on track.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.276
This church might just be trying to help.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.445
Well, you see it your way. I see it mine.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.448
Thought it was supposed to be $500 if I won,

20:00.533 --> 20:01.992
plus a cut of the action.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.952
You're new around here.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.788
Folks bet less on fights
between fighters they don't know.

20:06.873 --> 20:07.998
Just be glad you didn't lose.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.833
How do I know you ain't shorting me?

20:09.959 --> 20:10.959
You don't.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.796
But you came to me looking for action,
not the other way around.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.716
What, I got to fight again?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.885
You don't got to worry about that.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.012
Rufus don't fight.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.057
Well, what about that other thing?

20:26.142 --> 20:28.310
How soon can your boys get what I want?

20:28.394 --> 20:29.561
Well, you got the money?

20:30.605 --> 20:32.856
You get the cash. I'll make the call.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.402
Until then,
get your white-trash ass off my property.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.990
Rufus, clean this shit up.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.830
Hey! I said, "Hey!"

20:50.041 --> 20:51.124
You cost us money.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.417
Sorry about that.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.211
I don't think you are.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.713
You're right. I'm not.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.214
So, how's about you make it up to us,

20:58.299 --> 21:00.091
pay us back out of your winnings?

21:01.385 --> 21:03.094
Well, that ain't gonna happen.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.348
But I tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you a free piece of advice.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.767
Next time, bet on me.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.394
Don't fix to wait that long.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.647
Y'all really want to do this?

21:13.731 --> 21:14.898
You ain't that tough.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.817
Besides, there's two of us.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.824
I thought you said there were two of you.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.701
Well, what about your money?

21:26.786 --> 21:27.994
- Keep it!
- Too late for that.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.371
Please, don't! I'm sorry!

21:32.625 --> 21:33.917
What are you doing?

21:34.001 --> 21:36.294
Tapping out? There ain't no referee.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.462
Can't breathe.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.588
I know you can't breathe, dumbass.

21:38.673 --> 21:39.881
I got you in a choke hold.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.175
You know what we used to do to boys back
home when they get tough?

21:42.259 --> 21:44.302
We raccoon them. You know what that is?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.766
Now, tomorrow, when you wake up,

21:49.850 --> 21:53.728
you're gonna have a couple of nice
shiners to show all your boys.

22:07.368 --> 22:08.910
What? Is someone here?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.161
You were snoring.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.579
So, no one's here.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.790
You were snoring real loud.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.291
What time is it?

22:15.376 --> 22:17.168
Why? You got somewhere you need to be?

22:17.253 --> 22:20.171
I got a 6:00 Pilates class
I was hoping to make.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.632
Well, this is the job, Raylan.

22:22.717 --> 22:23.967
Long as somebody might come up

22:24.051 --> 22:26.469
and take a draw cheque
out of that mailbox, we wait.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.221
I think he was joking, boss.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.515
Really? Was he? 'Cause I couldn't tell.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.434
I'm sorry. What are we talking about?

22:32.810 --> 22:34.310
Where were you yesterday?

22:34.979 --> 22:36.146
Why? Did something happen?

22:36.230 --> 22:37.897
- No.
- So, what's the problem?

22:37.982 --> 22:39.941
You're keeping addict hours.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.902
You come in late,
you leave early, you're haggard.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.071
It's like the baby's already been born.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.990
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.116
Tim?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.659
I'd rather not take sides.

22:49.744 --> 22:50.910
Thank you.

22:50.995 --> 22:55.206
Well, would you rather do morning prisoner
transport for the next six months?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.375
You do seem a little tired.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.587
No shit. The question is, why?

23:01.422 --> 23:03.923
The smart money
in the office pool is on exotic dancing.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.884
What's your money on, Art?

23:05.968 --> 23:07.343
No. Mine's on nothing,

23:07.428 --> 23:10.930
'cause I know that you know that
it's against Marshal service policy

23:11.015 --> 23:14.309
for you to do anything on the side,
exotic or otherwise.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.102
You know what we should have done?

23:16.187 --> 23:18.396
We should have brought
a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.731
You got a bottle of Pappy?

23:19.815 --> 23:21.024
No, but Art does.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.484
Patrick Massett brought one by to him.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.152
Don't change the subject.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.029
- What did he want?
- He didn't want anything.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.238
He read the announcement.

23:27.323 --> 23:30.825
He wants Art's job.
It's why Art's probably with us now, in fact.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.951
Raylan.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.370
I'm just saying,
we can talk about it if you'd like.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.830
Raylan.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.043
That's the grandson, Milo.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.462
No, no, no. Don't get too close.
You'll spook him.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.386
Let's just follow him in the car.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.438
Shit. He made us.

24:03.484 --> 24:04.567
You see him?

24:06.821 --> 24:08.530
I got him. He's up there on the right.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.163
Help! We've got some pervies!

24:17.832 --> 24:20.083
Perverts! Perverts!

24:20.668 --> 24:22.794
Help! I'm being chased by perverts!

24:28.425 --> 24:31.261
All right, now, you perverts can go
ahead and stop right there.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.513
We ain't perverts. US Marshals.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.348
We need you to put those guns down.

24:35.432 --> 24:36.599
Marshals, my ass.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.476
These perverts was following me.

24:38.561 --> 24:39.978
You got any proof that you're Federals?

24:40.062 --> 24:41.980
You put the weapons down,
we'll show you some badges.

24:42.064 --> 24:43.189
Badges?

24:43.274 --> 24:45.400
Shit, I seen one badge,
I've seen a hundred of them.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.360
- You must be Jud.
- That's right.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.654
You're the one stole
the ambulance, ran it across the county,

24:49.738 --> 24:51.614
and then tried to jump Benedict Creek?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.074
You heard about that?

24:53.159 --> 24:54.284
Yeah, I heard about that.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.202
You know what happened
when they tried arresting me, then.

24:56.287 --> 24:57.328
Nope.

24:57.413 --> 25:00.456
If you did, you'd know you'd better get your
sorry government asses out of here.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.000
We ain't here for you, Jud.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.376
You got 10 seconds.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.003
This doesn't have to go wrong, son.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.088
Well, that's on you. Five seconds.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.548
Hey, he's stealing your bit.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.384
Any of you so much as flinch,
we're gonna put you down.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.596
You're gonna die right in front of your kin.
That what you want?

25:15.472 --> 25:16.723
Don't matter to me.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.725
- Y'all all right with it?
- Yep.

25:19.268 --> 25:20.768
Never thought I'd live this long.

25:21.395 --> 25:22.896
What is going on out here?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.273
These perverts was chasing me.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.151
They don't look like perverts.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.444
Well, maybe that one.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.695
They say they's Federals.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.280
We're US Marshals, ma'am.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.785
Marshals. That's fancy.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.538
You best go on ahead
and state your business.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.290
Just looking for Waldo Truth.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.959
My husband?

25:45.377 --> 25:46.419
He ain't here.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.588
If you want to leave a means to get in touch,

25:48.672 --> 25:50.256
when he stumbles home, I'll holler.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.925
But, just so you understand,

25:52.009 --> 25:54.802
till we meet Waldo, we're gonna put a stop
to those disability checks.

25:54.887 --> 25:55.929
- Hell you are.
- Bullshit!

25:56.013 --> 25:57.138
Y'all ain't gonna take our draw.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.681
Lower those goddamn guns!

25:58.766 --> 26:01.434
You want to start shooting
with my grandbabies right here?

26:05.022 --> 26:06.439
I'm sorry about them.

26:06.649 --> 26:10.276
Nelly, get inside and start calling
around for Waldo, would you?

26:11.362 --> 26:12.612
Sure, Mama.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.823
You ain't gonna take our draw.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.998
I met Waldo at the drive-in.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.794
I was there with my first husband, Kyle Lee.

26:28.754 --> 26:34.050
Kyle went off to pee,
and Waldo slid right into the car.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.510
Started chatting me up.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.512
I shut him down, showed him my ring,

26:37.596 --> 26:40.431
told him, "This snatch is off limits."
You know what he said?

26:40.516 --> 26:41.849
I can only imagine.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.726
He said, "I got a goldfish."

26:43.811 --> 26:44.936
Pardon?

26:45.020 --> 26:47.355
That was my response, too, Marshal.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.148
"The hell did you just say?"

26:49.233 --> 26:51.985
So, Waldo says, "I have a goldfish."

26:52.820 --> 26:56.072
So I say,
"What the hell does your goldfish have to do

26:56.156 --> 26:57.699
"with me being married?"

26:57.992 --> 27:00.743
So he says, "Oh, I'm sorry.

27:00.828 --> 27:03.830
"I thought we
were talking about shit that don't matter."

27:05.749 --> 27:08.543
The most romantic thing
a man ever said to me.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.169
Yep. I'll bet it was.

27:11.255 --> 27:13.089
Are y'all sure you won't have a drink?

27:13.173 --> 27:15.091
That's not allowed, but thanks for the offer.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.010
So, what do y'all want to
talk to Waldo about?

27:17.094 --> 27:18.261
He done something bad?

27:18.637 --> 27:20.179
Young fella, you do understand that

27:20.264 --> 27:22.056
we are Federal Officers, right?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.766
So, he did do something bad.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.643
I think he's referring to the pot.

27:26.353 --> 27:29.355
I got the glaucoma, real bad.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.483
It is difficult to see your children suffer.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.738
Know what I found
to be the secret to raising kids is?

27:36.822 --> 27:38.114
- Do tell.
- Hello?

27:38.198 --> 27:39.615
Waldo, come on in.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.743
Mr Truth, just stop right there.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.036
Well, look at this.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.704
Got the whole family together.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.789
That warms my soul. It really does.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.083
We just have a few questions.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.045
Now, you'll understand
if I greet my wife first.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.254
He's all right.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.547
Sure.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.179
You look real nice, Mother.

28:01.263 --> 28:02.305
Thank you.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.640
All right, then, gentlemen. I'm Waldo Truth.

28:04.725 --> 28:05.933
What is it I can do for you?

28:06.018 --> 28:08.436
Just have a seat right here
and let me see some ID, please.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.021
Certainly.

28:10.689 --> 28:15.026
Let's see. I got my official state card here.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.362
It's not a very good picture of me.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.281
And I got my social security card here, too.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.950
You're the same Waldo Truth
convicted of armed robbery

28:23.077 --> 28:25.119
back in 1971, served 11 years?

28:25.245 --> 28:28.122
We all make mistakes, but I paid for mine.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.624
I lived it nice and clean ever since.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.250
Does this look familiar?

28:32.961 --> 28:36.214
That was found inside
a Panamanian diplomatic pouch

28:36.298 --> 28:39.300
that we believe
was carrying some illicit material.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.219
I'm afraid you lost me now.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.637
Do you know Arlo Givens?

28:43.097 --> 28:44.138
Arlo who?

28:44.264 --> 28:46.224
That's the man who had the bag
with the ID in it.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.309
You know, I'm sorry. I just can't help you.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.229
But you are, in fact, Waldo Truth?

28:51.313 --> 28:52.563
Yeah. I'm Waldo Truth.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.065
Well, then, you're under arrest.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.400
What for?

28:55.484 --> 28:57.235
Y'all just stay right where you are.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.153
Parole violation back in '82.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.322
Yeah, the records were misplaced,

29:01.448 --> 29:03.157
but you're a wanted fugitive, Waldo.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.575
No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.911
You never let me finish my story from earlier.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.413
I ain't Waldo Truth.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.580
God damn you, Harold!

29:09.665 --> 29:10.748
My real name is Harold Shawn, Jr.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.917
I'm gonna cut your balls off. Harold, shut up!

29:13.001 --> 29:14.460
You never told me that Waldo was wanted!

29:14.795 --> 29:19.507
Look, I only came to know Mother here
and the family 15 years or so ago.

29:19.675 --> 29:23.010
I agreed to help keep the draw going
and pretend I'm Waldo.

29:23.137 --> 29:24.262
Where is Waldo?

29:24.346 --> 29:25.471
Shit.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.306
You ain't gonna take our draw.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.267
You gave him a gun?

29:29.351 --> 29:30.685
We agreed it was time.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.146
Mrs Truth, tell the boy to put down the gun.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.106
Milo, honey. You can't shoot a Federal.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.357
Put that gun down right now.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.985
I'll put it down,
soon as these shit-heads get...

29:39.319 --> 29:40.361
Get off me, pervert!

29:40.696 --> 29:42.655
You stay right there, on your ass.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.366
All right. Here's the deal, people.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.035
We are gonna haul your asses in
for harbouring a fugitive,

29:48.162 --> 29:51.289
threatening a Federal Officer,
possession and distribution of narcotics,

29:51.373 --> 29:52.957
mail fraud, identity theft,

29:53.041 --> 29:55.209
and some other shit
that I'm sure we're gonna find here.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.544
So, congrats.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.839
A draw cheque is now the least
of your goddamn concerns,

29:59.923 --> 30:01.716
and I think I'll start with you, ma'am.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.092
I don't know where Waldo is.

30:03.177 --> 30:05.470
- Is that right?
- I hadn't seen him in almost

30:05.596 --> 30:09.932
30 damn years,
not since that man came and took him away.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.893
What man?
What do you mean, "Took him away"?

30:11.977 --> 30:16.022
He said he had some job for him,
he was some kind of pilot,

30:16.106 --> 30:18.024
and that Waldo wasn't coming back.

30:18.108 --> 30:19.358
And you were okay with that?

30:19.443 --> 30:21.360
Of course I was. Waldo was an asshole.

30:21.612 --> 30:22.778
I thought he was romantic.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.989
Sure, until I said, "I do."

30:25.365 --> 30:28.034
After that, he'd beat on me like it was his job.

30:28.410 --> 30:31.996
We got in a fight so bad one time
I stabbed him in the cheek.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.915
You stabbed him in the face?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.125
No, honey. Not that cheek.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.877
You sold our daddy out?

30:38.003 --> 30:40.838
Waldo being gone was the
answer to our prayers,

30:40.923 --> 30:42.089
all of ours.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.508
What was his name?

30:43.592 --> 30:45.885
The pilot that took Waldo?

30:46.053 --> 30:47.345
I don't know.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.931
Jew, something like that.

30:50.057 --> 30:51.224
Jew?

30:53.018 --> 30:54.936
Was it Drew? Drew Thompson?

30:55.229 --> 30:57.855
Yeah, that's it. How did you figure that?

30:57.940 --> 30:59.774
Yeah. How did you figure that?

30:59.900 --> 31:00.942
We're done here.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.568
- We are?
- Yep.

31:03.237 --> 31:04.862
Ma'am, you have a lovely family,

31:04.947 --> 31:07.281
and we wish the best of luck to all of you.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.116
We will be taking the guns, though.

31:09.743 --> 31:10.785
Let's go.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.871
I hereby baptise you
in the name of the Father

31:13.956 --> 31:17.124
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

31:17.251 --> 31:20.378
this water washing away all guilt from sin

31:20.796 --> 31:22.296
and cleansing your heart.

31:22.631 --> 31:27.468
Now, emerge, reborn a child of God.

31:30.639 --> 31:31.722
Amen.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.599
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.312
Congratulations.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.605
Boyd.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.651
Do not be alarmed.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.074
Boyd Crowder.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.160
I had, in fact,
prayed that you and your friends

31:53.245 --> 31:54.954
might find your way into this tent.

31:55.289 --> 31:57.415
Speak of the devil, and he will appear.

31:57.499 --> 32:00.751
"And these signs shall
follow them that believe.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.255
"In my name, they shall cast out devils."

32:05.507 --> 32:07.633
Are you gonna cast me out, Preacher?

32:08.635 --> 32:10.595
Is that why you're here?

32:10.762 --> 32:14.140
On the contrary, Boyd.
I'd much rather bring you in.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.351
Let all here witness,

32:17.477 --> 32:20.521
that even the most prodigious sinners

32:20.647 --> 32:22.481
can become beacons of faith.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.945
Are you prepared to
come forth and be saved?

32:28.030 --> 32:31.032
Well, what makes you think
we need saving, Preacher?

32:31.158 --> 32:32.783
Everyone here knows of you.

32:32.868 --> 32:36.621
I have been told personally
how you exploit people for your own gain,

32:36.705 --> 32:39.040
and, as we know from Isaiah,

32:39.166 --> 32:43.044
"'There is no peace," saith the Lord,

32:43.170 --> 32:44.378
"'unto the wicked."'

32:44.463 --> 32:45.463
Wicked?

32:45.547 --> 32:50.551
Well, I would never be so bold as to pass
judgment against a man I do not know.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.054
But the hubris

32:53.138 --> 32:55.890
of making assumptions
about a people and a place

32:55.974 --> 32:57.558
to which you are a foreigner

32:58.477 --> 33:01.020
strikes me as a grave sin, indeed.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.190
All souls here

33:05.400 --> 33:07.318
and those in the other towns I have served

33:07.402 --> 33:10.154
would testify to my integrity.
Would they to yours?

33:11.073 --> 33:13.324
You know, I once stood where you are now.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.868
Preaching to wayward souls,

33:16.370 --> 33:18.579
asking for their faith,

33:18.705 --> 33:21.874
and, in return,
offering them eternal salvation.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.753
But, in the end, their faith was not rewarded.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.089
And mine was shattered.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.591
Is that why you are now pursuing
this materialistic path?

33:30.676 --> 33:32.510
We all got to eat, Billy.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.929
You got your collection plate, and I got mine.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.431
Every man here gives only
as he is willing and able.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.684
They stop giving to you in West Virginia?

33:40.352 --> 33:42.520
Or Tennessee before that?

33:42.604 --> 33:45.022
Is that why you move on the way you do?

33:45.107 --> 33:47.441
It is the Lord who determines my path.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.194
In fact, he came to me in a dream.

33:50.612 --> 33:54.532
Gave onto me a prophetic vision
of Harlan and its suffering.

33:54.741 --> 33:58.953
Well, you know what the apostle John
had to say about prophets.

34:00.122 --> 34:04.291
"Beloved, do not believe every spirit,

34:04.918 --> 34:06.794
"but test the spirits

34:06.878 --> 34:08.629
"to see whether or not they are from God,

34:08.755 --> 34:12.425
"for many false prophets
have gone out into the world."

34:14.553 --> 34:15.886
I look at you.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.556
I think about you moving from state to state,

34:18.639 --> 34:22.309
asking all these people
for their hard-earned money,

34:22.436 --> 34:25.478
and offering them
empty promises of salvation in return,

34:25.605 --> 34:27.106
and, I wonder,

34:27.983 --> 34:31.318
if when John wasn't
talking about false prophets,

34:32.112 --> 34:33.654
he wasn't talking about you.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.119
Mr Crowder's scepticism...

34:41.830 --> 34:43.121
...is wise.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.292
And hard-earned.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.503
My struggle will never be as great as yours,

34:50.505 --> 34:52.840
for I sleep in the Lord's warm embrace

34:53.632 --> 34:56.510
and will never know true cold or hunger.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.474
Yes.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.310
So, from this moment on,

35:05.020 --> 35:07.104
no member of this congregation

35:07.189 --> 35:10.191
shall give even one cent to this church.

35:10.317 --> 35:13.194
"For the man who hath a bountiful eye
shall be blessed,

35:13.403 --> 35:17.031
"and the man who giveth his bread
to the poor shall never want."

35:17.157 --> 35:19.116
So, let all here bear witness,

35:19.201 --> 35:23.496
as I ask none of you
to ever sacrifice the bread from your table

35:23.580 --> 35:25.706
in the name of this church ever again.

35:25.832 --> 35:29.043
Praise be to God. Praise be to God.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.921
- Lord almighty, praise be to God.
- That didn't go so well.

35:32.047 --> 35:36.091
Actually, Colton, I think we got
exactly what we came here for.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.893
That was my second year.

35:47.020 --> 35:50.064
Drew Thompson
pancaking into that driveway,

35:50.565 --> 35:54.276
about the most exciting thing to happen
in southeastern Kentucky since...

35:54.611 --> 35:55.736
Electricity?

35:55.862 --> 35:57.238
They have that down there, now?

35:57.364 --> 36:00.115
That was the day cocaine
came to Harlan County.

36:00.951 --> 36:03.994
Oh, look.
ME's office sent this over about an hour ago.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.246
Guess what it says.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.207
The body in the driveway
had a scar on its ass?

36:09.084 --> 36:10.960
You gonna make another
"Marshal stiffy" comment?

36:11.127 --> 36:13.546
- I might.
- If Waldo Truth died in that driveway,

36:13.630 --> 36:15.464
where the hell is Drew Thompson?

36:16.216 --> 36:17.716
Well, I don't know.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.969
But I'll bet your daddy does.

36:21.555 --> 36:24.265
Now, everybody in that church
was smiling ear to ear

36:24.391 --> 36:25.933
except for his sister.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.351
Turn around!

36:28.436 --> 36:30.354
Now, Billy may answer to a higher power,

36:30.730 --> 36:33.107
but his sister's pulling all the strings.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.609
Now, we find out what it is she wants,

36:35.694 --> 36:37.403
and these flood waters will recede.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.779
What about Ellen May?

36:38.864 --> 36:40.364
Well, Ava, I'm afraid
she might have been swept away

36:40.448 --> 36:41.949
by this storm for good.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.117
I know you liked her, baby,

36:43.243 --> 36:44.785
but, believe me,
there's plenty other girls out there.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.120
It ain't that, Boyd.

36:46.788 --> 36:49.957
What if, in her need to unburden her soul,

36:50.917 --> 36:54.962
she decides to divulge certain
details about the murder of a pimp?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.133
Wynn Duffy.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.927
Why, Duffy's people, meet my people.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.722
My people, meet Wynn Duffy's people.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.931
Slow night?

37:06.099 --> 37:08.267
We closed for remodelling.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.477
I hope he's not your interior decorator.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.731
No, actually.
He's the reason why you're here.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.317
Now I'm confused.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.569
Well, we caught this young man

37:18.653 --> 37:21.739
selling Dixie Mafia heroin out back.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.992
What makes you so sure he's one of mine?

37:25.118 --> 37:27.328
Well, his driver's license
said Frankfort, for one.

37:27.454 --> 37:30.414
Well, I didn't go to law school,
but I believe that's what

37:30.665 --> 37:32.750
the attorneys call "circumstantial evidence."

37:32.834 --> 37:34.919
Which is why I sent my boys up to Frankfort

37:35.003 --> 37:36.337
to buy some of your heroin.

37:36.838 --> 37:40.841
Now, these we got off Danny, here.

37:41.343 --> 37:46.180
And these we
bought at the corner of Third and Jefferson.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.350
I believe that's in your zip code, is it not?

37:50.018 --> 37:51.435
Now, I didn't go to law school, either,

37:51.519 --> 37:55.314
but I believe that's what
they would call "a smoking gun."

37:57.025 --> 38:00.361
Mr Crowder, I have many men in my employ.

38:00.528 --> 38:01.987
If one of them strayed,

38:02.530 --> 38:05.157
I can only apologise and say,

38:05.533 --> 38:06.867
"It will not happen again."

38:07.160 --> 38:08.535
Well, you got me all wrong, Wynn.

38:08.662 --> 38:12.206
I don't want an apology!
I want to be your partner.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.626
I would like to be
your distributor of heroin in Harlan County.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.128
Now, I figure
we split it right down the middle.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.631
You and me,
we could both make out pretty well.

38:20.715 --> 38:24.969
But even if I were looking for a
partner, which I'm not, by the way,

38:25.053 --> 38:27.471
it would have to be someone I could trust.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.973
Well, you can trust me.

38:29.057 --> 38:32.142
But I don't even trust
the way you just now said I could trust you.

38:34.688 --> 38:37.564
Well, I was hoping
not to have to go down this road,

38:37.691 --> 38:40.818
but if you want Danny
to leave this room alive,

38:41.236 --> 38:43.237
I'd ask you to reconsider my offer.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.255
Any dealer silly enough

39:02.382 --> 39:06.218
to poach your territory
is not welcome in my crew.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.180
Boys, if you would.

39:12.684 --> 39:13.767
I'm sorry about the mess.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.602
We'll clean it up.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.273
Let's look at this
as a first step in the trust direction.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.026
Well, that's mighty Christian of you.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.112
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna leave now.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.407
No.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.702
Oh, you know what? Since we're being

39:32.454 --> 39:33.787
so chummy.

39:34.748 --> 39:36.206
You wouldn't have any idea why Arlo Givens

39:36.291 --> 39:39.793
murdered that Dixie Mafia soldier
in Tramble, would you?

39:44.758 --> 39:47.384
Well, if Arlo Givens
killed somebody in prison,

39:47.469 --> 39:50.220
this is the first
I'm hearing about it, sincerely.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.058
All right. Well, it seems to me that

39:54.142 --> 39:56.143
maybe you and Arlo ought to have a chat.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.062
Well, I'll have my secretary
make an appointment,

39:58.146 --> 39:59.396
and I'll get back to you.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.815
Good luck with the remodel.

40:06.905 --> 40:10.199
My. That is quite a story.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.369
It doesn't bore you, hearing about my day?

40:14.621 --> 40:17.081
Your days are more interesting than most.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.000
What?

40:21.127 --> 40:23.003
I just didn't think you were that kind of girl.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.172
I could be any number of kind of girls,

40:25.256 --> 40:27.591
depending on what the situation called for.

40:29.219 --> 40:30.636
So, what's next?

40:30.970 --> 40:32.930
I was just thinking we could lock that door

40:33.014 --> 40:35.224
and have some fun on this here bar.

40:35.308 --> 40:36.642
Did you?

40:37.185 --> 40:39.144
'Cause I actually meant
what was next with the case.

40:39.229 --> 40:40.687
- I knew that.
- Well?

40:40.980 --> 40:44.358
I guess we
just keep digging and see what turns up.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.901
'Cause you're the guy in the white hat.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.654
'Cause that's what I get paid to do.

40:48.738 --> 40:52.074
So what happens
if you find this guy who was

40:52.158 --> 40:54.535
ruthless enough to fake his own death

40:54.619 --> 40:57.079
and smart enough that
nobody even realised it?

40:57.997 --> 40:59.206
It's hard to say.

40:59.499 --> 41:02.960
But there could be some gunplay involved.

41:03.837 --> 41:05.003
Can I tell you something?

41:05.088 --> 41:06.547
What's that?

41:07.006 --> 41:10.717
In the right light,
you could be considered attractive.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.053
Thank you.

41:13.388 --> 41:15.848
I wouldn't kick you out of bed
for eating crackers.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.433
Why else would I be there?

41:26.943 --> 41:28.485
Oh, I hope I'm not interrupting.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.445
Buddy, we are definitely closed.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.780
That's all right.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.991
I just need to have a quick word with my wife.
