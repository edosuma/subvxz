Henry, go get the ball!

01:15.709 --> 01:18.246
What're you doing?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.713
Digging for fossils,

01:19.747 --> 01:21.582
and I just found something.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.385
Little help,
please?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.519
Oh, yeah.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.159
This thing's a fossil?

01:31.192 --> 01:32.660
Yep.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.163
It's something that lived
in the prehistoric times

01:35.196 --> 01:36.264
and turned to stone.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.865
Once we get it
out of the sand,

01:37.898 --> 01:40.901
next up is to figure out
what creature it belongs to.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.736
Henry, what're you doing?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.338
We just found a fossil!

01:44.372 --> 01:46.674
But we're playing
volleyball!

01:46.707 --> 01:49.343
Sorry.
Boys only.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.379
They used to say that
to Mary Anning,

01:51.412 --> 01:52.680
and I don't
wanna play anyways.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.448
Who's Mary Anning?

01:54.482 --> 01:56.684
She's only one of the greatest
fossil finders ever.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.355
This is her.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.857
She lived in England
200 years ago.

02:03.891 --> 02:07.261
She was the first to
discover the plesiosaur...

02:07.295 --> 02:08.762
This guy.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.465
Have you ever discovered
a prehistoric marine reptile?

02:11.499 --> 02:12.500
No.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.735
Exactly.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.337
Sounds like you should
play with her.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.172
I wish I could.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.375
I bet she could help me figure
out who this fossil belongs to.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.477
C'mon, Henry!

02:23.511 --> 02:24.878
Good luck with the fossil.

02:25.946 --> 02:29.683
[***]

some help with this.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.365
[woman]
You're doing it all wrong.

02:44.398 --> 02:47.468
What you want to do is
uncover the specimen fully

02:47.501 --> 02:49.870
before removing it
from the sand.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.872
Otherwise you
risk damaging it.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.416
...na?

03:02.450 --> 03:05.286
Well, "Day-Nah,"

03:05.319 --> 03:06.787
shall we uncover
the specimen?

03:06.820 --> 03:07.788
Yes!

03:09.390 --> 03:13.661
* [music with prominent

03:19.567 --> 03:21.769
Jolly good!
Now lift it out.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.637
Heave ho!

[both grunt with effort]

03:31.512 --> 03:33.281
Spots and stripes!

03:33.314 --> 03:34.715
It's so cool.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.653
It feels rather warm to me.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.856
No, "cool" is another way
to say "sweet."

03:42.890 --> 03:44.858
It means "wicked."

03:44.892 --> 03:47.828
It's a way to say
"wonderful."

03:47.861 --> 03:50.264
Definitely wonderful.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.400
Now, which
prehistoric creature

03:52.433 --> 03:53.834
do you think it
belongs to?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.703
Think, Dana, think...

03:55.736 --> 03:58.038
Ponder, Mary, ponder...

03:58.071 --> 03:59.707
[giggle]

03:59.740 --> 04:03.311
It kind of looks like
a sail...

04:03.344 --> 04:06.347
Like what's on
a Spinosaurus' back.

04:06.380 --> 04:11.051
[snarling and hissing]

04:11.084 --> 04:14.054
OR it could be a flipper
that belongs to a plesiosaur.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.756
[bellow]

04:15.789 --> 04:16.890
Really?

04:16.924 --> 04:21.362
[plesiosaur calling out]

04:21.395 --> 04:23.297
That's the reptile
you discovered.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.432
Well done.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.566
First of many.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.568
But if it's a flipper,

04:27.601 --> 04:29.703
it could also belong
to the Archelon.

04:29.737 --> 04:34.775
[growling and snorting]

04:34.808 --> 04:37.044
An enormous

04:37.077 --> 04:38.646
Interesting theory.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.581
[both] There's only
one way to...

04:40.614 --> 04:43.451
...ascertain to whom
this fossil belongs.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.518
Spinosaurus?

Oh, yes please.

awaken this beat.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.371
[Dana]
Definitely.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.607
But how are we going to compare
this fossil to its sail?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.576
I shall lift you up.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.615
[gasp]
steady!

05:14.648 --> 05:18.118
This is a tad bit harder
than I expected.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.420
[Dana]
Okay, and...

05:19.453 --> 05:23.924
[grunting with effort]

05:23.957 --> 05:26.126
It's not a match.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.995
This fossil is too small.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.897
You can put me down now.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.064
Oops!

06:05.799 --> 06:07.568
I know!

06:07.601 --> 06:10.571
But we still have to figure out
who this fossil belongs to.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.905
Hm....

06:11.939 --> 06:13.907
If it's not a sail...

06:13.941 --> 06:15.809
it must be a flipper!

06:15.843 --> 06:18.111
Maybe it belongs
to the plesiosaur.

Aren't you going to

Hey, Dana,
what're you up to?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.511
I just met Mary Anning
from the 1800's.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.846
We're trying to figure out
who a fossil belongs to.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.749
Great. Have a good time.
Just stay where I can see you.

06:57.485 --> 07:00.120
Ugh, sorry... sir.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.456
Hey, did you find who
your fossil belongs to?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.492
[Dana] Not yet,
but my friend is helping.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.660
It's too small to
belong to a Spinosaurus,

07:06.694 --> 07:09.663
but it may have been a flipper
that belonged to a plesiosaur.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.665
Hey, that's the one
you showed us before.

07:11.699 --> 07:12.766
Need any help?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.234
Sorry.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.803
Girls only.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.612
What is the matter?

07:24.645 --> 07:25.746
Boys.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.615
You're telling me!

07:27.648 --> 07:30.684
In my time, boys thought
they were the only ones

07:30.718 --> 07:32.653
who could know anything
about fossils.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.889
But they came around,
and they saw what I found.

07:35.923 --> 07:40.160
Some boys just need more time
to realize girls' abilities.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.963
In the meantime,
we do what we want.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.198
[roar]

07:47.134 --> 07:49.670

07:59.079 --> 08:01.749
[Mary]
Let's compare the two.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.251
It's not a match.
The fossil is bigger.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.857
[Mary] And the plesiosaur
does not look happy.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.793
I don't think it wants us
playing with its flippers.

paddle away fast enough!

He'll soon be upon us!

What's that?

08:25.773 --> 08:28.108
Whoa!
It's the Archelon!

08:28.141 --> 08:29.877
Whoa!

08:29.910 --> 08:32.846
[Mary] And look!
The plesiosaur is retreating!

08:33.914 --> 08:36.249
Whoa, we're really high up.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.219
Whoa, it's amazing.

Could it be?

[Dana]
Spots and stripes!

09:17.691 --> 09:19.860
[Mary]
So cool.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.094
It's a match.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.996
This fossil is
an Archelon flipper!

09:24.064 --> 09:25.999
[both]
Bye, Archelon!

09:27.935 --> 09:31.639
It was a delight to be in
the field with you today, Dana.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.307
I hope we have the opportunity
to work together again.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.876
So do I.

Goodbye!

Hey, our volleyball
popped on something.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.698
We dug around and we think
we found a fossil.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.366
Come help us
figure out what it is.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.235
So, you've realized
my abilities...

10:02.269 --> 10:03.904
Yes.
Good.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.207
You, get the skipping ropes...

10:07.240 --> 10:09.209
You two, grab the shovels.

We're gonna need to
set up a dig site!

Aren't you excited, Sara?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.790
Sure.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.125
Just sure?
You used to love trains.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.161
Yeah, when I was
like six.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.881
I have an idea how to
make this train ride

11:53.914 --> 11:55.215
more exciting for you.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.250
Does it involve
dinosaurs?

11:57.284 --> 11:58.852
How'd you know?

11:58.886 --> 12:01.254
Just a lucky guess.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.890
What's your idea, Dana?

12:02.923 --> 12:05.492
[Dana]
Well, sometimes when I'm bored,

12:05.525 --> 12:07.995
I imagine I'm doing
something else.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.998
So, instead of just
riding on a train...

12:11.031 --> 12:13.300
We could be on
a dino rescue train,

12:13.333 --> 12:15.102
searching for dinosaurs!

12:15.135 --> 12:16.469
Or...

12:16.503 --> 12:20.107
we could be rescuing
cute baby dinos!

12:20.140 --> 12:22.810
Even better!
Great imagining, seester.

12:41.962 --> 12:45.933
Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,
rescuuuue!

12:45.966 --> 12:46.967
[laugh]

12:53.106 --> 12:55.208
Baby triceratops spotted.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.477
[squeak]

12:57.510 --> 12:59.212
[roar]

12:59.246 --> 13:01.815
The baby's not fast enough
to outrun a T-Rex.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.551
You're right-- A T-Rex
could run as fast as a bike.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.454
She'll easily catch up
to a baby triceratops.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.022
What're we going to do?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.324
All aboard.

13:11.358 --> 13:14.261
Conductor,
bring us beside the baby!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.296
We need to get him
on this train!

13:16.329 --> 13:18.098
[roar]

13:18.131 --> 13:19.466
...And fast.

13:21.034 --> 13:24.337
Baby triceratops,
hop on board!

13:24.371 --> 13:28.375
[frightened squeaking]

13:28.408 --> 13:31.344
He's not listening,
Rescuer Dana.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.413
Try using some
food as bait.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.618
[Sara]
Veggies, meat, or fish?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.553
Triceratops
are herbivores.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.389
Which means
they eat plants.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.957
Lettuce it is.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.494
Hey, baby triceratops!

13:47.527 --> 13:49.529
Want some tasty lettuce?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.598
[squeak]

13:51.631 --> 13:54.902
It's not working,
Rescuer Dana.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.970
That doesn't
make any sense.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.339
[sigh] If we can't
get the baby on board,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.574
maybe we can lure
the T-Rex away.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.945
Smart thinking, Rescuer Sara.
T-Rex are carnivores.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.347
Which means they eat meat.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.082
Beef jerky it is.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.218
Hey, T-Rex!

14:11.251 --> 14:13.887
Want some yummy beef jerky?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.355
Look, he wants it!

14:15.388 --> 14:16.957
He wants it!

14:16.990 --> 14:18.591
[growl]

14:18.625 --> 14:21.261
Seems like the T-Rex
is as fast as this

14:21.294 --> 14:22.896
miniature train, too.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.298
Conductor,
full speed ahead!

14:25.332 --> 14:26.866
[whistle]

14:31.071 --> 14:33.473
The baby triceratops is safe.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.574
Throw the meat lure.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.610
Hey, T-Rex!
You want this?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.212
[growl]

14:39.246 --> 14:41.381
Then go get it!

14:41.414 --> 14:43.350
[Dana]
It worked! Good job.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.253
Triceratops high-three.
[roar]

14:47.320 --> 14:50.958
[***]

14:52.025 --> 14:53.126
[whistle]

14:55.562 --> 14:57.530
Ah...
That was fun.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.266
Where're you going?

14:59.299 --> 15:01.101
We saved the baby
triceratops.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.669
Our first Rescue Mission
is complete.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.671
But we didn't figure out

15:04.704 --> 15:06.373
why the baby didn't
take the veggie bait.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.208
Are you saying you wanna

15:08.241 --> 15:10.177
take another ride
on the train?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.444
Well...

15:11.478 --> 15:13.613
I guess I could go
for one more ride.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.083
You sure?
We don't have to.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.484
[sigh]

15:17.517 --> 15:20.387
Hop on, Dana.
We're not done rescuing yet.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.255
Rescue Mission Number two:

15:22.289 --> 15:25.592
Rescuer Sara and Rescuer Dana
are on a mission to figure out

15:25.625 --> 15:28.361
why the baby triceratops didn't
take the veggie bait.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.997
Chugga, chugga,
chugga, chugga...

15:30.030 --> 15:31.631
[Dana]
Woot woot!

15:32.765 --> 15:34.134
[frightened squeak]

15:34.167 --> 15:37.070
Baby triceratops
and T-Rex spotted.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.406
Full stop,
conductor!

15:40.673 --> 15:42.742
[brakes squeal]

15:42.775 --> 15:44.177
What's the plan, Dana?

15:44.211 --> 15:46.013
First, let's lure the T-Rex away

15:46.046 --> 15:49.249
so we can figure out why the
baby didn't take the lettuce.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.218
Meat lure coming up!

15:56.289 --> 15:59.726
Hey T-Rex, want some more
yummy beef jerky?

15:59.759 --> 16:01.728
[snarl]

16:01.761 --> 16:03.430
[sniff]

16:03.463 --> 16:05.032
[Dana]
It's working!

16:05.065 --> 16:06.466
Hey, baby triceratops!

16:06.499 --> 16:08.368
Now's your chance to run!

16:08.401 --> 16:13.373
[triceratops squeaks,
T-rex growls]

16:13.406 --> 16:17.077
Why is the baby triceratops
running after the T-Rex?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.478
Good question.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.214
I have never seen
anything like this before.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.554
Maybe the baby isn't
running after the T-Rex.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.424
Maybe he's running towards
the beef jerky!

16:31.458 --> 16:34.227
But I thought you said
triceratops were herbivores.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.330
They are...
Or they're supposed to be.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.632
Then why would it want
the beef jerky?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.401
We'll have to
perform a taste test.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.703
But first we've gotta
deal with the T-Rex.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.406
Hey, T-Rex!
Ya hungry?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.641
Then go...

16:48.675 --> 16:50.210
get it!

16:51.844 --> 16:53.546
Hey, baby triceratops.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.482
Do you like beef jerky too?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.117
[squeak]

16:57.150 --> 16:58.551
Then here you go!

17:00.387 --> 17:03.490
[delighted chittering]

17:03.523 --> 17:05.558
Whoa!
He's eating meat.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.227
Taste test complete.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.362
The triceratops didn't
take the veggie bait

17:09.396 --> 17:11.764
because he likes
to eat beef jerky.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.302
Nice work, Rescuer Sara.
Triceratops high three.

17:16.369 --> 17:21.308
[imitates dino roar]

17:23.710 --> 17:25.678
[whistle]

17:25.712 --> 17:27.547
Not so fast, Dana.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.149
What do you mean?

17:29.182 --> 17:30.650
We figured out
the baby triceratops

17:30.683 --> 17:32.352
likes meat more
than veggies,

17:32.385 --> 17:34.421
so our second Rescue
Mission is complete.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.357
But we didn't figure out why
the baby ate the beef jerky

17:37.390 --> 17:39.159
when it's supposed
to be a herbivore.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.693
We need to take
another ride.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.130
Looks like someone
likes trains again.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.597
Uh, I-- I didn't say that.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.334
But you are saying you
wanna go for another ride.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.270
Well...
I do if you do.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.439
Ehh....

17:52.472 --> 17:53.540
I do!

17:55.475 --> 17:57.510
Rescue Mission Number Three:

17:57.544 --> 18:01.348
Rescuer Sara and Rescuer Dana
are on a mission to figure out

18:01.381 --> 18:03.350
why the baby triceratops
ate meat

18:03.383 --> 18:05.418
when it's supposed
to be a herbivore.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.687
[both]
Chugga, chugga...

18:07.720 --> 18:09.356
Woot woo!

18:14.227 --> 18:17.430
[triceratops snorting]

18:17.464 --> 18:19.432
Baby triceratops spotted!

18:19.466 --> 18:20.700
Full stop,
conductor!

18:22.402 --> 18:25.438
And looks like his mom's
here with him, too.

18:25.472 --> 18:29.676
[mother grunts,
baby squeaks]

18:29.709 --> 18:31.678
Let's taste test
if the mom triceratops

18:31.711 --> 18:33.280
eats meat or veggies.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.747
That way we'll know for sure

18:34.781 --> 18:36.616
if they're herbivores
or carnivores.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.559
Whoooo's hungryyyy?!

18:46.593 --> 18:50.197

18:58.838 --> 19:00.240
Huh?

19:00.273 --> 19:01.908
That doesn't
make any sense.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.744
Why does the baby eat meat,
but the mom doesn't?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.846
Maybe it's like
me and the trains.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.482
Are you saying the baby
gets bored of meat?

19:09.516 --> 19:11.551
No...

19:11.584 --> 19:14.787
I'm saying there's some things
you like when you're younger

19:14.821 --> 19:17.390
that you don't really like
when you get older.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.825
That's it!

19:18.858 --> 19:20.827
Sometimes baby animals
eat different things

19:20.860 --> 19:22.895
so they can grow
faster and stronger,

19:22.929 --> 19:26.499
so that way they can get away
from big dinos like the...

19:26.533 --> 19:27.800
[roar]

19:27.834 --> 19:29.336
[Sara]
T-Rex!!

19:29.369 --> 19:31.204
Quick, Sara,
throw some more beef jerky!

19:32.672 --> 19:35.642
Bad news.
We're out of beef jerky.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.844

full steam ahead!

[snarling and growling]

19:58.030 --> 19:59.566
[whistle]

20:04.304 --> 20:06.005
We did it!
We got away.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.675
And we figured out
the triceratops are herbivores,

20:08.708 --> 20:10.243
except when they're babies.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.479
All our Dino Rescue
Missions are complete.

That was actually pretty fun.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.619
I guess some things you thought
you didn't like anymore,

20:19.652 --> 20:21.288
you actually do.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.657
Nah.
I still don't love trains...

20:26.593 --> 20:28.561
But I've always loved

20:28.595 --> 20:30.897
hanging out with
my little seester.
