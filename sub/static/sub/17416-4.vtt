00:09.078 --> 00:11.198
Oi! I'm a policeman!

00:15.718 --> 00:18.717
I've been up all night weighing up
my career against helping you out.

00:18.718 --> 00:21.238
No, Kate, that's not what I...
You bastard, sir!

00:23.718 --> 00:27.198
So you're going to take all of us
down with you? Are you, sir?

00:29.198 --> 00:31.478
What was that about something
going down the drain?

00:31.479 --> 00:33.478
You all right?
That'll be your investigation.

00:40.998 --> 00:42.438
Our focus shifts completely

00:42.439 --> 00:45.717
to the double murder on Greek Lane
and the killing of Wesley Duke.

00:45.718 --> 00:49.997
Tony, you know DI Buckells has taken
over the Laverty disappearance?
Yeah.

00:49.998 --> 00:52.317
We're developing her
money laundering as a lead.

00:52.318 --> 00:54.997
If Gates had
solved the triple murder,

00:54.998 --> 00:57.357
he could have shaken off
these allegations.

00:57.358 --> 01:00.517
Now, he's a dead man walking.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.238
Why keep digging?

01:07.278 --> 01:11.718
He's here. Do you want
her body found with your
dirty business all over her?

01:16.478 --> 01:18.997
Right, er, Aidan, Kelvin,
I want you to focus

01:18.998 --> 01:21.957
on Jackie's links
to organised crime.

01:21.958 --> 01:25.077
Tina, Richie, we need to expand
the search for the body, yeah?

01:25.078 --> 01:27.958
Whoever we can connect to that body
is our prime suspect.

01:29.038 --> 01:30.638
DI Buckells, a word please.

01:31.718 --> 01:33.238
Now.

01:34.238 --> 01:36.838
Richie? You lot were crap
at the weekend.

01:37.878 --> 01:40.878
You need a new centre-half, mate.

01:42.238 --> 01:45.917
How's the, erm, money laundering
investigation coming?

01:45.918 --> 01:47.677
Still early days, sir.

01:47.678 --> 01:50.757
What do you know about
financial irregularities?

01:50.758 --> 01:52.797
Enough.

01:52.798 --> 01:54.998
It's a very specialised area,
you know.

01:57.238 --> 01:59.158
Nervous about something, sir?

02:01.918 --> 02:06.117
AC-12 have been trying
to stick me for weeks, son.

02:06.118 --> 02:08.478
If you think you can do better,
be my guest.

02:09.678 --> 02:11.397
You go after a fellow officer,

02:11.398 --> 02:13.678
you'll see how those lot
feel about you.

02:15.438 --> 02:18.557
My advice is to dump it
on Fraud Squad.

02:18.558 --> 02:19.598
Yeah?

02:45.678 --> 02:47.038
Bent bastard.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.517
Hello.

02:55.518 --> 02:56.557
What news?

02:56.558 --> 02:59.317
The money laundering
part of the investigation

02:59.318 --> 03:03.077
is being transferred
to the Fraud Squad.

03:03.078 --> 03:05.757
I told you to shut it down!

03:05.758 --> 03:10.518
Yeah, I am being watched. I can't
do that. Nobody could do that!

03:12.438 --> 03:14.437
I've done the next best thing.

03:14.438 --> 03:16.358
It's a complicated white-collar crime

03:16.359 --> 03:18.477
and the offender's
missing presumed dead.

03:18.478 --> 03:21.037
The CPS won't touch it
with a bargepole.

03:21.038 --> 03:23.918
They better not. For your sake.

03:25.358 --> 03:26.598
I've held up my side.

03:26.599 --> 03:30.117
I want Jackie's body and
the murder weapon disposed of now.

03:30.118 --> 03:32.478
Och, away! Hey!

03:33.678 --> 03:34.718
Hey!

04:42.678 --> 04:44.557
Glad you could make it.

04:44.558 --> 04:46.998
Sir, I want to call him.
I'm winding down the operation.

04:46.999 --> 04:50.717
Sir, please! Hilton said he
was willing to sideline Gates
so long as we back off.

04:50.718 --> 04:52.477
But that was before we lost Steve.

04:52.478 --> 04:54.157
Assign another officer.

04:54.158 --> 04:57.957
Haven't got the manpower, Kate.
I'm 10% down already on
my budget to Counterterrorism.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.037
Why throw good money after bad?

05:00.038 --> 05:03.237
Listen, we've got him
for what we wanted originally...

05:03.238 --> 05:06.437
professional conduct and general
duties. Laddering?

05:06.438 --> 05:08.957
We don't have him for perverting
the course of justice,

05:08.958 --> 05:11.517
for complicity
in murder and manslaughter.

05:11.518 --> 05:13.717
Listen, his career's over.
Job done. Right?

05:13.718 --> 05:16.237
I've spent months on this operation,
sir.

05:16.238 --> 05:17.718
I'm calling you in, Kate.

05:17.719 --> 05:19.677
No way, sir.

05:19.678 --> 05:22.078
I can nail him myself.

05:48.638 --> 05:50.838
Yeah?

05:56.998 --> 05:59.277
You wanted a statement from me.

05:59.278 --> 06:02.517
About the text message from Jackie
Laverty's phone to DCI Gates' phone.

06:02.518 --> 06:03.837
It's a dead end.

06:03.838 --> 06:06.117
Any other leads?

06:06.118 --> 06:08.357
I know what you're up to, Fleming.

06:08.358 --> 06:12.517
If DCI Gates wants any of this
he can put a request in writing,
via the Chief Super.

06:12.518 --> 06:15.718
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.198
Yeah?

06:34.598 --> 06:37.878
DI Buckells might be looking
into Jackie's money laundering.

06:39.078 --> 06:40.117
I know.

06:40.118 --> 06:43.437
Well, I'm worried
it might connect to you, sir.

06:43.438 --> 06:45.397
Well, it doesn't.

06:45.398 --> 06:47.597
Arnott was the problem.

06:47.598 --> 06:51.477
And now he's bottled it,
I can get back to doing my job.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.718
Well, that's great, sir.

06:56.198 --> 06:59.838
Nige, Dot, back to Greek Lane.
Work to do.

07:01.958 --> 07:04.877
I take it this means
I'm forgiven, Kate?

07:04.878 --> 07:09.238
Not quite, sir. I reckon you're
still short by a box of Milk Tray.

07:21.198 --> 07:22.277
Morning, sir.

07:22.278 --> 07:25.558
The search team's
completed operations.

07:29.438 --> 07:31.638
Fleming, Nige?

07:33.398 --> 07:36.957
What was the final forensic
report on the chemical residues?

07:36.958 --> 07:39.437
Traces of hydrogen
peroxide in the kitchen,

07:39.438 --> 07:42.117
in areas consistent
with household bleach.

07:42.118 --> 07:44.797
What about those Arabic books
we found?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.518
I'll chase up the translators, boss.
Thanks, Nige.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.758
Steady, Nige.

08:11.198 --> 08:12.998
So this is where you are.

08:17.118 --> 08:21.277
Poor bastard's been
in the morgue for weeks.

08:21.278 --> 08:22.878
Three post mortems.

08:24.398 --> 08:25.918
Wasn't your fault, Steve.

08:28.518 --> 08:32.917
I should have done more to challenge
the Fahrenheit order.

08:32.918 --> 08:34.078
He'd still be alive.

08:37.318 --> 08:41.517
Fleming's still out there, you know?
She's not given up.

08:41.518 --> 08:45.077
Yeah, well she can sit
in judgement on Gates.

08:45.078 --> 08:46.597
Who am I to?

08:46.598 --> 08:50.237
Well, that's a matter for
your own conscience, Steve.

08:50.238 --> 08:55.158
All I know is, because of you,
Kate's been left high and dry.

09:23.038 --> 09:25.477
Boss never bought me choccies.

09:25.478 --> 09:27.998
Yeah, you look
more like a flowers man, Dot.

09:37.158 --> 09:39.797
How long have you been married, sir?

09:39.798 --> 09:41.358
Just over ten years.

09:42.438 --> 09:43.798
And Jackie?

09:49.078 --> 09:50.758
Sorry.

09:51.718 --> 09:56.597
No, it's just not
going to sound very good.

09:56.598 --> 09:59.517
I'm not going to sit in judgement,
sir, if that's what you mean.

09:59.518 --> 10:00.637
"Sir."

10:00.638 --> 10:02.477
Come on, Kate, we're off duty.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.037
It'd feel weird calling you Tony.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.317
Why?

10:05.318 --> 10:06.838
Because you don't look like a Tony.

10:07.878 --> 10:10.278
Well, only my mum gets
to call me Anthony.

10:11.798 --> 10:14.637
Look, you're right, we don't
have to talk about difficult stuff.

10:14.638 --> 10:16.678
No, it's all right, it's...

10:21.798 --> 10:23.598
I knew her from years back.

10:24.718 --> 10:25.998
I didn't realise.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.397
Yeah, I was a DC.

10:27.398 --> 10:30.077
She was the estate agent that
showed me round my first flat.

10:30.078 --> 10:31.637
You're kidding.

10:31.638 --> 10:33.437
And when I moved in,

10:33.438 --> 10:36.797
I made this joke that
now she knows my address, and, erm...

10:36.798 --> 10:37.998
Afternoon, sir.

10:37.999 --> 10:39.198
How are you?

10:43.838 --> 10:47.518
A couple of nights later,
she knocked on my door.

10:49.758 --> 10:52.917
Then, six months down the line,
I'm doing the whole thing.

10:52.918 --> 10:56.557
I bought a ring, I'm down on one
knee in a restaurant like a mug.

10:56.558 --> 10:58.038
Then...

11:02.198 --> 11:03.838
she pissed off with a millionaire.

11:07.598 --> 11:10.317
I spent a couple of years
feeling sorry for myself,

11:10.318 --> 11:11.997
and then I met my Jools.

11:11.998 --> 11:14.157
Mrs Gates? Yeah.

11:14.158 --> 11:18.238
Then, out of the blue, Jackie's
back in town, newly divorced.

11:19.358 --> 11:20.678
What happened?

11:22.838 --> 11:24.438
It was like before.

11:25.998 --> 11:28.757
It was like that night
when I was alone in a bare flat

11:28.758 --> 11:30.078
and she came knocking.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.877
And now she's dead,
and it's probably because of me.

11:36.878 --> 11:38.478
Don't torture yourself.

11:40.278 --> 11:42.158
Look, I wanted to apologise.

11:43.358 --> 11:46.677
I should never have used you to help
flush out the rat in the squad.

11:46.678 --> 11:48.317
But I was backed into a corner...

11:48.318 --> 11:51.557
I was just pissed off
at being manipulated, sir.

11:51.558 --> 11:53.718
If you need my help, just ask.

12:00.198 --> 12:02.718
As Buckells goes through
Jackie's finances...

12:03.838 --> 12:07.117
there's going to be
a link to you, isn't there?

12:07.118 --> 12:08.638
No, there's not.

12:12.358 --> 12:14.078
I could make it disappear.

12:20.958 --> 12:22.517
How?

12:22.518 --> 12:25.478
Get to it before Buckells.

12:29.278 --> 12:30.638
No, sorry, Kate.

12:32.598 --> 12:34.038
Paranoid.

12:58.638 --> 13:00.718
I was missing the glamour.

13:01.958 --> 13:05.158
And the operation's been missing
a blunt instrument.

13:06.878 --> 13:10.557
Gates hinted there was a financial
connection from Jackie to him.

13:10.558 --> 13:13.797
Well, I studied his personal
finances, there was never anything.

13:13.798 --> 13:16.597
No exotic holidays,
no house in the country.

13:16.598 --> 13:18.396
If she cut him in on
the money laundering,

13:18.397 --> 13:20.038
God knows what he's spending it on.

13:20.039 --> 13:22.838
Same as anyone -
the thing he cares about most.

13:23.958 --> 13:26.356
She had no time to think about it
when it was happening,

13:26.357 --> 13:28.638
but now she wondered
if she hadn't just been worried

13:28.639 --> 13:30.917
about the expedition
losing its leader.

13:30.918 --> 13:33.198
Holding him in her flippers,
she found herself...

13:34.278 --> 13:37.278
imaging what it would be like
if Scott wasn't... I'll get it! OK.

13:38.398 --> 13:39.837
Nige! Come in.

13:39.838 --> 13:41.397
Hi, Jools, how you doing?

13:41.398 --> 13:43.798
Good.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

13:47.038 --> 13:49.197
All right, mate?

13:49.198 --> 13:51.197
Is there something wrong?

13:51.198 --> 13:52.797
No, I was just passing by.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.638
Wondered if you fancied coming
down the Arms for a swift pint?

13:56.998 --> 13:58.718
I would love to, mate, but...

14:00.118 --> 14:01.597
snowed under.

14:01.598 --> 14:05.477
Well, that's why I thought
you could do with a night off.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.158
Any other night.

14:16.718 --> 14:19.437
You're in the middle
of a shit storm, Tone.

14:19.438 --> 14:21.397
Why've you stopped talking to me?

14:21.398 --> 14:23.557
Of course I haven't.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.677
You're my best mate.

14:25.678 --> 14:27.038
Am I?

14:30.318 --> 14:31.677
Friday night.

14:31.678 --> 14:34.717
You, Mel, me, Jools,
we'll get a baby-sitter.

14:34.718 --> 14:36.357
We'll have a balti.

14:36.358 --> 14:37.838
Great.

14:40.238 --> 14:41.678
Yeah.

14:43.198 --> 14:44.718
I appreciate this, Nige.

14:47.238 --> 14:48.478
Right.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.037
Good night, Jools!
Night-night!

14:52.038 --> 14:55.117
Night, Natalie, night, Chloe!
Night-night!

14:55.118 --> 14:57.158
Good night, man. Yeah.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.797
What are the fees here,
if you don't mind me asking?

15:22.798 --> 15:24.477
Â£3,500.

15:24.478 --> 15:25.677
Per year?

15:25.678 --> 15:26.997
Per term.

15:26.998 --> 15:30.197
For new pupils, we also require
a deposit of Â£1,000 per pupil

15:30.198 --> 15:32.518
to secure a place,
with the first term paid in advance.

15:32.519 --> 15:35.917
And the Gates's had
no trouble meeting the cost?

15:35.918 --> 15:37.957
There was nothing improper.

15:37.958 --> 15:39.357
That's not what I asked.

15:39.358 --> 15:44.158
You'll understand our parents'
financial records are confidential.

15:45.238 --> 15:47.918
I'll be back with a court order.
I'll have to inform the Head.

15:49.678 --> 15:52.117
You don't tell anyone.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.398
OK?

16:02.358 --> 16:04.438
You were right. There's something.

16:05.638 --> 16:08.917
I push from the outside,
you push from the inside.

16:08.918 --> 16:10.478
Welcome back, Steve.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.918
Yeah.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.438
Buckells isn't the problem.

16:36.118 --> 16:38.358
Arnott's on the case again.

16:40.038 --> 16:41.918
He was at your daughters' school.

16:49.518 --> 16:50.957
Sir.

16:50.958 --> 16:53.398
Sir. Stop, sir!

17:02.998 --> 17:04.557
This is what he wants you to do.

17:04.558 --> 17:06.358
I'm not having it!
I'm not having it, Kate!

17:08.877 --> 17:11.557
As soon as I heard he was back
I got worried.

17:11.558 --> 17:15.078
I had uniform drive past your house
and your daughters' school.

17:16.117 --> 17:18.637
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said anything. No.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.478
No, I...

17:31.198 --> 17:32.758
It's my girls.

17:34.118 --> 17:36.557
When they, erm,
got into their school,

17:36.558 --> 17:38.718
I got slapped
with a nine grand bill.

17:41.078 --> 17:43.317
I was trying to get
a loan to cover it,

17:43.318 --> 17:45.918
cos they were in danger
of losing their places.

17:51.918 --> 17:54.318
Jackie paid it without telling me.

17:55.438 --> 17:57.078
She said it was a gift.

17:58.998 --> 18:00.918
I should've said no.

18:03.598 --> 18:04.918
I should...

18:08.078 --> 18:10.477
My old man never did
anything for his kids

18:10.478 --> 18:12.558
and I swore I was
going to be different.

18:20.518 --> 18:22.318
Well, I'll keep tabs on Arnott.

18:23.558 --> 18:25.878
Whatever he finds,
you'll know about it.

18:28.958 --> 18:30.238
Thank you.

18:41.198 --> 18:42.718
All right?

18:44.558 --> 18:46.397
Jackie Laverty paid the deposit

18:46.398 --> 18:49.478
and first-term advance fees for
Gates' daughters at Edge Park Prep.

18:51.118 --> 18:52.797
Gates opened up to you?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.038
How did you...?

18:54.039 --> 18:56.118
You do your side, I'll do mine.

18:57.518 --> 18:59.478
Well, once we've gone
through the records,

18:59.479 --> 19:03.237
we'll have a financial trail
leading from organized crime
to Gates via Jackie.

19:03.238 --> 19:05.118
The same crew that killed
Jackie Laverty

19:05.119 --> 19:07.478
carried out the Greek Lane murders.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.357
Could Gates be involved
with them, too?

19:11.358 --> 19:12.957
Well, we should target Cottan.

19:12.958 --> 19:16.157
He was pulled off surveillance
the night of the murders.

19:16.158 --> 19:18.757
Well, isn't Cottan too tight
with Gates to give him up?

19:18.758 --> 19:23.037
I overheard a row between Cottan
and Morton about loyalty to Gates.

19:23.038 --> 19:26.318
Cottan was wavering, Morton made
a dig at Dot about ticking boxes.

19:28.758 --> 19:30.797
Sounded like a sensitive subject.

19:30.798 --> 19:32.157
Right.

19:32.158 --> 19:34.917
Well, for appearances,
we should bring in the whole squad,

19:34.918 --> 19:37.437
make the interviews
focus on laddering.

19:37.438 --> 19:38.918
Makes sense.

19:40.718 --> 19:42.678
You going to leave me
in the lurch again?

19:44.918 --> 19:46.358
I had a wobble.

19:47.598 --> 19:48.957
No more wobbles?

19:48.958 --> 19:50.877
No more wobbles.

19:50.878 --> 19:52.158
Good.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.077
No comment, sir. Oh, come on.

19:57.078 --> 20:00.677
DCI Gates ladders offences,
doesn't he, Morton? Hmm?

20:00.678 --> 20:05.037
I mean, that's how he's returned
the best performance indicators
in the last three years, right?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.478
No comment, sir.

20:10.558 --> 20:13.997
On the night that
Wesley Duke was murdered,

20:13.998 --> 20:16.558
DCI Gates failed to report for duty -
where was he?

20:17.718 --> 20:20.557
No comment, sir.
Oh, come on, you're his mate!

20:20.558 --> 20:24.237
Don't tell me you didn't try
and contact him? No comment, sir.

20:24.238 --> 20:26.677
You'd just got yourself
a triple murder.

20:26.678 --> 20:30.118
I mean, you can't seriously defend
Gates' conduct, can you, DC Morton?

20:32.998 --> 20:34.478
No comment, sir.

20:37.438 --> 20:39.878
We've built a very damning
case against him, Morton.

20:39.879 --> 20:42.638
Then you won't need to turn me, sir.

20:43.718 --> 20:45.437
When the bomb goes off...

20:45.438 --> 20:48.278
there'll be a hell of a lot
of collateral damage.

20:55.478 --> 20:58.117
I've been a DC for 20 years.

20:58.118 --> 20:59.917
I'll still be one when I retire.

20:59.918 --> 21:02.757
Ambitious blokes, like you,

21:02.758 --> 21:05.077
get buffeted by every
little wind of change.

21:05.078 --> 21:06.518
Me?

21:08.038 --> 21:09.877
Just keep sailing on.

21:09.878 --> 21:12.477
Interview terminated.
Go on, piss off!

21:12.478 --> 21:15.117
Thank you, sir. Pissing off, sir.

21:15.118 --> 21:16.558
Welcome back, DS Arnott.

21:26.758 --> 21:28.118
That's one down.

21:34.078 --> 21:35.718
Sir.

21:40.318 --> 21:41.638
Sir.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.398
I thought we had a deal, Ted.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.838
No, we had a discussion, sir.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.117
I had the whole thing planned.

21:49.118 --> 21:53.477
Restructuring of Tactical Ops,
TO-20 disbanded, Gates sidelined.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.757
My email is sitting
in the Chief Constable's inbox.

21:56.758 --> 21:59.437
The charge against Gates, sir,
that we discussed,

21:59.438 --> 22:00.718
is in respect of laddering.

22:00.719 --> 22:04.237
I have to substantiate
that allegation with some
pretty hard evidence,

22:04.238 --> 22:08.078
otherwise Gates is at liberty
to sue us for constructive dismissal.

22:09.958 --> 22:11.557
I appear to have misunderstood.

22:11.558 --> 22:13.837
Well, if that is my fault,
I apologise, sir.

22:13.838 --> 22:16.597
But I have to interview
all of Gates' team to ascertain

22:16.598 --> 22:18.237
whether he was working alone.

22:18.238 --> 22:19.838
Yes, of course!

22:21.478 --> 22:23.678
And was he?

22:25.438 --> 22:28.117
Well, I'm not at liberty
to say as yet, sir.

22:28.118 --> 22:30.677
I thought we were working
together on this, Ted.

22:30.678 --> 22:33.237
Yes, well, we are, sir, but I think
we'd both be gratified

22:33.238 --> 22:35.078
to know Gates is a lone gunman, sir,

22:35.079 --> 22:37.877
and not the product of
institutionalised malpractice...

22:37.878 --> 22:39.278
sir.

22:52.318 --> 22:53.557
Fleming?

22:53.558 --> 22:55.157
Sir, I thought you should know,

22:55.158 --> 22:57.557
we've all just been
called in by AC-12,

22:57.558 --> 22:58.958
me, Dot and Nige.

23:00.598 --> 23:02.038
What for?

23:03.238 --> 23:06.117
They're not saying,
but they've pulled in copies

23:06.118 --> 23:08.838
of all recent cases,
including the Greek Lane murders.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.478
DC Fleming? Sorry, sir.

23:15.598 --> 23:17.958
Fleming? Fleming?!

23:48.638 --> 23:51.477
What's your understanding
of the term "laddering"?

23:51.478 --> 23:53.238
I'll be guided by you, sir.

23:55.998 --> 23:57.876
Well, laddering is the amplification,

23:57.877 --> 24:00.318
indeed multiplication,
of charges against the offender

24:00.319 --> 24:03.518
for the purpose of securing
administrative detections.

24:04.678 --> 24:07.077
In short, it's the buffing up
of our figures

24:07.078 --> 24:10.277
to make it look like
more crimes are being solved.

24:10.278 --> 24:11.518
Does this ring any bells?

24:11.519 --> 24:13.157
You've got a nerve, sir.

24:13.158 --> 24:16.238
DCI Gates is the best
detective in this city.

24:17.318 --> 24:20.438
Why don't you do everyone a favour
and go after some proper criminals?

24:23.158 --> 24:24.837
That your statement, Fleming?

24:24.838 --> 24:26.078
It is, sir.

24:28.678 --> 24:30.597
Interview terminated.

24:30.598 --> 24:32.158
Off you go.

24:49.038 --> 24:51.757
DS Cottan - is it all right
if I call you Matthew?

24:51.758 --> 24:54.957
Fine by me, sir.
I know you also go by Dot.

24:54.958 --> 24:57.158
Matthew it is.

24:58.518 --> 25:01.797
Appearances can be deceptive,
Matthew, can't they?

25:01.798 --> 25:05.638
I mean, you look at DCI Gates and...
very admirable individual.

25:06.918 --> 25:08.756
Devoted family man.
Officer of the Year.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.718
I mean, you admire him,
don't you, Matthew?

25:10.719 --> 25:14.677
I respect him, sir.
I like the bloke a lot, yeah.

25:14.678 --> 25:17.997
And does he respect you?
I mean, does he like you?

25:17.998 --> 25:21.357
I don't really go round
thinking like that, sir.

25:21.358 --> 25:25.638
No. That's it. Emotional security.
I look at you and that's what I see.

25:27.718 --> 25:30.398
Yeah, a confident copper.
Someone who can handle himself.

25:31.958 --> 25:34.358
But like I said, you know,
appearances can be deceptive.

25:34.359 --> 25:38.038
You're the last person I'd look
at and think, "mental health issue".

25:40.318 --> 25:41.798
Hear you like the horses.

25:41.799 --> 25:43.358
I used to.

25:44.998 --> 25:46.997
In 2009, you were given
a final written warning

25:46.998 --> 25:48.798
for dereliction of duty.

25:50.078 --> 25:52.358
Why was that, Dot?
It's all in the file.

25:53.638 --> 25:55.998
You couldn't go past a bookie's
without dropping in.

25:57.198 --> 26:00.078
All-nighters at the casino.
Up to your eyes in debt.

26:01.398 --> 26:03.277
Your missus walked out.

26:03.278 --> 26:04.717
You had a breakdown.

26:04.718 --> 26:06.076
Yeah, well, I was an addict.

26:06.077 --> 26:08.236
What do they say?
Once an addict, always an addict?

26:08.237 --> 26:09.598
No, not everyone says that.

26:09.599 --> 26:11.797
DCI Gates doesn't.

26:11.798 --> 26:14.597
He scraped you off the bottom of the
barrel and put you on his squad.

26:14.598 --> 26:17.357
All that overtime,
you soon worked off those debts.

26:17.358 --> 26:18.478
That's right, yeah.

26:18.479 --> 26:21.198
Yeah, well there's one debt
you'll never work off.

26:22.198 --> 26:23.438
To Gates.

26:24.758 --> 26:26.437
And he knows it.

26:26.438 --> 26:29.037
And that's why
he counted on you, Matthew,

26:29.038 --> 26:33.398
to abandon the surveillance
operation in Greek Lane.

26:37.118 --> 26:38.837
Anything you say in here, Matthew,

26:38.838 --> 26:40.918
will be treated
with the strictest confidence.

26:43.358 --> 26:46.317
DS Raser says anything,
it's his career, I can assure you.

26:46.318 --> 26:47.718
We only want the truth.

26:48.878 --> 26:51.397
You were supposed
to be watching the house.

26:51.398 --> 26:54.197
Instead of waiting for the next turn,
you took an early swerve.

26:54.198 --> 26:55.238
Come on now, Matthew.

26:55.239 --> 26:58.717
Hmm? That's when the murders
took place.

26:58.718 --> 27:02.037
Look, we got a call saying
the next turn was on their way.

27:02.038 --> 27:05.357
We'd had notices about unnecessary
overtime. So we decided to go.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.957
Oh, WE decided, WE decided.
Who decided, Matthew?

27:07.958 --> 27:10.037
Huh?

27:10.038 --> 27:11.517
Did you decide, Matthew?

27:11.518 --> 27:14.037
A breach of procedure
that resulted in the untimely deaths

27:14.038 --> 27:16.837
of these two young men? What?

27:16.838 --> 27:18.278
Or did Gates order you to go,

27:18.279 --> 27:20.558
knowing whatever happened
you'd stick by him?

27:21.958 --> 27:25.077
There's two yellow notices
against your card already, son.

27:25.078 --> 27:28.157
One more strike and you're out.
No job. No pension.

27:28.158 --> 27:30.917
You owe Gates
for giving you a second chance.

27:30.918 --> 27:32.637
But you don't owe him your future.

27:32.638 --> 27:34.358
The red notice is only the start,
son.

27:34.359 --> 27:36.878
I'll go for the criminal conviction,
you know I will.

27:38.398 --> 27:41.318
You don't owe him
a cover-up for a double murder.

27:50.758 --> 27:52.717
It was Tony.

27:52.718 --> 27:55.478
He was the one that gave the order.

27:56.678 --> 27:59.118
Interview terminated.

28:00.758 --> 28:03.078
Thank you, Matthew.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

28:23.038 --> 28:26.917
It all fits.
The gang that committed the Greek
Lane murders was laundering money

28:26.918 --> 28:29.797
via Jackie, money that was paying
for Gates' daughters' education.

28:29.798 --> 28:32.717
He facilitated the hit
to protect his income.

28:32.718 --> 28:34.677
I think we've got the bastard!

28:34.678 --> 28:37.038
I'll see you in the pub for a pint.

28:51.958 --> 28:54.638
Well, do yourself a favour, mate.

29:28.478 --> 29:30.317
What's the story?

29:30.318 --> 29:33.637
They're going after us for laddering.
They're coming after me, you mean.

29:33.638 --> 29:35.038
We're in this together, mate.

29:35.039 --> 29:37.757
The laddering could be a
smokescreen. You'd know, would you?

29:37.758 --> 29:41.358
There's something else
they have on me. What?

29:42.878 --> 29:44.478
It doesn't matter.

29:48.398 --> 29:50.837
She knows about it? Nige.

29:50.838 --> 29:53.397
Everyone knows
she's been stuck for a complaint,

29:53.398 --> 29:55.116
but AC-12 don't seem to give a toss.

29:55.117 --> 29:56.198
What's all that about?

29:56.199 --> 29:58.877
With all due modesty, they've got
bigger fish to fry.

29:58.878 --> 30:03.237
Their case against you started with
the free breakfast at the cafe.
Who wrote up the arrest report?

30:03.238 --> 30:04.598
Yeah, that's right. It was me.

30:04.599 --> 30:06.637
We all know the complaint
came from the muggers.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.358
Do we? Yes. Cut it out! Cut it out!

30:08.359 --> 30:11.157
Do you not see, Christ,
they're into me for everything.

30:11.158 --> 30:14.438
The laddering, the breakfast,
Jackie, fucking everything!

30:18.638 --> 30:21.837
Who are those bastards
to come after you, boss?

30:21.838 --> 30:24.357
They've forgot
what the job used to be.

30:24.358 --> 30:26.718
All the crap you took at Hendon.

30:29.998 --> 30:32.477
Jesus, Nige, what
the hell did you tell them?

30:32.478 --> 30:34.437
Boss...

30:34.438 --> 30:38.317
Mate, what do you think?

30:38.318 --> 30:40.958
No comment to everything.

30:42.198 --> 30:43.517
Kate?

30:43.518 --> 30:46.398
I told them where to stick it.

30:47.838 --> 30:48.878
Dot?

30:50.398 --> 30:52.317
No comment.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.917
You know me, Tone.

30:53.918 --> 30:55.318
Right.

30:56.958 --> 30:58.198
Nige, I'm sorry.

31:00.318 --> 31:02.478
It's just, I've got to think.

31:07.678 --> 31:08.717
It's late.

31:08.718 --> 31:10.357
Go home.

31:10.358 --> 31:12.438
Go home!

31:15.078 --> 31:17.237
Boss? All of you.

31:17.238 --> 31:18.558
Please.

32:01.438 --> 32:03.958
We're not open. What do you want?

32:10.758 --> 32:14.038
Remember me?
I'm here to search the premises.

32:21.278 --> 32:23.397
The lift stunk, blood.

32:23.398 --> 32:25.037
Yeah, of your farts, cuz.

32:25.038 --> 32:28.478
No, that's your mum. Every time
I do her, she gives me a kebab.

32:31.518 --> 32:33.958
Freezing our nuts off out there,
waste man. Sorry, Ryan.

32:41.038 --> 32:43.677
You don't mind us popping in,
do you, Terry? No.

32:43.678 --> 32:45.518
Home away from home, this is.

32:50.758 --> 32:52.877
Have you got a problem?

32:52.878 --> 32:55.398
I said, have you got a problem?

32:59.678 --> 33:03.158
Soz, mate. Couldn't remember
where the bog was, innit?

33:06.918 --> 33:08.237
I'm only messing about.

33:08.238 --> 33:09.278
Get off!

33:13.038 --> 33:14.878
He's looking at my tits.
I wasn't!

33:18.478 --> 33:21.518
Oi, look what the council give him!
Wish I was spasticated.

33:29.478 --> 33:32.798
Hey, Sammy, how are you?

33:40.198 --> 33:42.198
Hiya. Hey.

33:45.438 --> 33:47.077
The way you sounded on the phone,

33:47.078 --> 33:49.158
I didn't know what state
to expect you in.

33:52.278 --> 33:54.517
This trouble at work, Jools.

33:54.518 --> 33:55.918
It's pretty serious.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.558
How serious?

33:59.918 --> 34:01.557
There was a woman.

34:01.558 --> 34:04.117
Jackie, and she offered to help
with the girls' schooling.

34:04.118 --> 34:06.837
What? What woman?

34:06.838 --> 34:10.117
She's just somebody I met at work.
She's a businesswoman.

34:10.118 --> 34:12.598
Why would she want to do that?
She...

34:14.918 --> 34:17.437
Was there something
going on between you?

34:17.438 --> 34:18.717
No.

34:18.717 --> 34:20.717
Tony?

34:20.717 --> 34:22.277
I would never do that.
You know that.

34:22.279 --> 34:26.036
She just let on
she could pull strings
to get the girls into their school.

34:26.038 --> 34:27.678
But that all worked out fine.

34:29.237 --> 34:31.478
She paid the first set of fees.

34:32.998 --> 34:36.516
What? Listen, no listen, the girls
would've lost their places,

34:36.518 --> 34:38.837
and I couldn't have that.

34:38.838 --> 34:40.678
We didn't have the money,
so, she offered.

34:44.398 --> 34:46.358
I still don't get
why would she want to do that.

34:46.359 --> 34:48.078
To get me in her pocket.

34:54.678 --> 34:57.797
Is this why that anti-corruption
officer was round here?

34:57.798 --> 34:59.318
Yeah.

35:03.558 --> 35:05.477
You said you could fix it.

35:05.478 --> 35:10.118
I've tried. No. I've...
There's got to be something.

35:22.638 --> 35:26.238
Quickly, everyone, gather round.

35:29.838 --> 35:32.797
The Chief Constable has ordered me
to take personal charge

35:32.798 --> 35:36.117
of the operation
as Senior Investigating Officer.

35:36.118 --> 35:40.237
Owing to his familiarity with
the investigation,

35:40.238 --> 35:42.317
Deputy SIO will be DCI Gates.

35:42.318 --> 35:44.517
DCI Gates? Thank you, sir.

35:44.518 --> 35:47.477
Greek Lane's been under
investigation as the scene

35:47.478 --> 35:48.797
of a double homicide.

35:48.798 --> 35:52.957
The IP's were two IC6 males
in their 20s.

35:52.958 --> 35:56.637
There were Arabic books found at the
scene. They've been translated.

35:56.638 --> 35:58.277
They were chemistry manuals.

35:58.278 --> 36:01.797
Forensics also found evidence of
hydrogen peroxide use at the scene,

36:01.798 --> 36:04.638
and that's a well-recognised
chemical constituent of IEDs.

36:05.678 --> 36:08.717
Look, the evidence points very
strongly to these men

36:08.718 --> 36:10.997
being involved
in a terrorist operation.

36:10.998 --> 36:14.637
Now, at this point, we have no
clear understanding

36:14.638 --> 36:16.518
of why these men
were murdered or who by.

36:16.519 --> 36:19.557
But their involvement in terrorist
planning raises the possibility

36:19.558 --> 36:22.757
that they were killed for their
silence, and the wider terror group,

36:22.758 --> 36:26.077
of which these men formed a part,
poses a threat to the public.

36:26.078 --> 36:28.357
So the objectives
of our investigation

36:28.358 --> 36:31.397
are to work with counterterrorism
officers and the Security Services

36:31.398 --> 36:34.237
to uncover the infrastructure that
supported this cell

36:34.238 --> 36:37.637
and to prevent the remaining
elements from executing their plan.

36:37.638 --> 36:42.197
I want all inspectors and sergeants
to attend an operational overview

36:42.198 --> 36:44.397
in the Briefing Room with me.
That's it, sir.

36:44.398 --> 36:46.958
Thank you, DCI Gates.
Thank you, everybody.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.317
This is bollocks and you know it.

36:53.318 --> 36:56.397
You screwed up the op,
you killed an innocent man

36:56.398 --> 36:58.957
and now the real terrorists
are at large.

36:58.958 --> 37:02.397
I'm just tidying up your mess, son.
If you're too emotionally involved,

37:02.398 --> 37:04.678
remove yourself.

37:16.638 --> 37:20.597
Sir - sir, do you have a minute?

37:20.598 --> 37:21.637
DS Arnott.

37:21.638 --> 37:25.437
Erm... sir, do you mind
if we talk through here?

37:25.438 --> 37:28.677
Er, coffee, tea? Ted? Steve?

37:28.678 --> 37:33.198
Yes, sir, that'll be great.
Coffee for three, please, Sheila.

37:34.958 --> 37:36.717
Gates is playing you.

37:36.718 --> 37:39.517
Those lads were using chemistry to
make crack, not bombs,

37:39.518 --> 37:40.998
and bleach to scrub their sink.

37:40.999 --> 37:43.837
They were selling drugs to finance
terrorist activity,

37:43.838 --> 37:46.197
a recognised AQ modus operandi.

37:46.198 --> 37:50.117
AQ? Al-Qaeda, Jesus Christ.
You're loving this.

37:50.118 --> 37:54.158
And if you get a promotion
out of it... A little decorum,
please, DS Arnott.

37:55.598 --> 37:57.557
Sir.

37:57.558 --> 38:00.597
Terrorism is the single greatest
challenge in modern policing.

38:00.598 --> 38:04.397
Not to take this seriously
could be catastrophic. Who for? You?

38:04.398 --> 38:08.197
Steve! Sir - we have reason to
believe, sir,

38:08.198 --> 38:10.558
that DCI Gates suspended
a surveillance operation,

38:10.559 --> 38:13.838
thereby facilitating the double
homicide at Greek Lane.

38:16.318 --> 38:19.557
I'd like to hear
the tape of Gates' call.

38:19.558 --> 38:22.557
He didn't make it through
Despatch, sir.

38:22.558 --> 38:24.398
We've got a witness.

38:25.838 --> 38:27.517
So it's his word against Gates'?

38:27.518 --> 38:31.117
Look, we have concrete evidence of
an improper financial relationship

38:31.118 --> 38:33.398
between DCI Gates
and Jackie Laverty.

38:35.998 --> 38:38.917
When he brought me the evidence
against the terrorist cell,

38:38.918 --> 38:41.957
DCI Gates was at pains to point out

38:41.958 --> 38:46.237
the sensitivity of his position
regarding your investigation.

38:46.238 --> 38:48.837
He declared that Ms Laverty had made
a one-off payment

38:48.838 --> 38:52.557
to secure his daughters' places at
Edge Park Prep School,

38:52.558 --> 38:56.077
a payment that was made without his
consent or knowledge,

38:56.078 --> 38:58.118
and that the money was paid back.

38:59.198 --> 39:03.757
I have authorised all available
resources, and DCI Gates,

39:03.758 --> 39:05.877
with his intimate
knowledge of the case history,

39:05.878 --> 39:08.238
is essential to
the success of this operation.

39:10.518 --> 39:11.958
At least we have the laddering.

39:11.959 --> 39:15.157
Come on, that's a drop in the ocean.
We've been round the houses, Steve.

39:15.158 --> 39:17.197
Round the houses
and down the bloody drains.

39:17.198 --> 39:19.557
So you're throwing in the towel.
That's rich.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.998
Look, Hilton blows with the wind.
I thought you were better than that.

39:21.999 --> 39:24.877
Listen, I would've thought that if
anybody understood

39:24.878 --> 39:27.477
that counterterrorism can get you
off, it would've been you.

39:27.478 --> 39:29.237
What's that supposed to mean?

39:29.238 --> 39:32.197
You were involved in an operation
where an innocent man got killed

39:32.198 --> 39:34.557
and you're running round,
free as a bird.

39:34.558 --> 39:37.317
All because our senior officers
would rather see ten innocents die

39:37.318 --> 39:40.517
than let one terrorist succeed.
So why'd you recruit me then?

39:40.518 --> 39:43.478
Lately, I've been asking myself
the same bloody question.

39:48.198 --> 39:52.318
Go on, my son. Go on.

40:02.758 --> 40:04.998
Phone.

40:11.638 --> 40:13.438
You bent bastard.

40:23.238 --> 40:24.637
Yeah?

40:24.638 --> 40:29.317
There's a copper poking his nose
into one of Jackie's old salons.

40:29.318 --> 40:31.157
What copper?

40:31.158 --> 40:34.637
Some DS Arnott.

40:34.638 --> 40:37.677
You were meant to have this sorted,
you bent bastard.

40:37.678 --> 40:40.437
Hey it... it was sorted. I...

40:40.438 --> 40:43.118
I've got to shut the place down
and clear it out by tonight.

40:44.198 --> 40:46.158
D'you know how
many of these I've got?

40:46.159 --> 40:49.797
Every place he knows about,
I've got to close.

40:49.798 --> 40:52.837
Do you know how much
that's going to cost?

40:52.838 --> 40:55.438
You should've done what you
were bloody told.

40:56.478 --> 40:59.597
He's anti-corruption.
That means he's after me, not you.

40:59.598 --> 41:03.637
All I have to do...
He's all over my business!

41:03.638 --> 41:05.037
All right!

41:05.038 --> 41:07.998
D'you think he'll turn a blind eye,
you stupid twat?

41:12.198 --> 41:15.878
If it's one bloke, he can be fixed.

41:18.398 --> 41:23.677
Hey... Hey, could we...?
Could we maybe take a breath?

41:23.678 --> 41:27.037
With him gone, you'll be free to do
what I tell you.

41:27.038 --> 41:32.878
We'll say when and where.
Your job is to get him there.

41:35.918 --> 41:37.918
I can't...

41:41.158 --> 41:44.998
I'm out. All right? Gates...

41:53.478 --> 41:55.917
Hey! And you, you little shit.

41:55.918 --> 41:59.037
I see you again,
I'm going to arrest you.

41:59.038 --> 42:00.718
Are you fucking mental?

42:01.838 --> 42:05.157
Tommy's got your bird.
Your business all up her.

42:05.158 --> 42:08.318
Your prints are on the knife.
You're fucked, waste man.

42:20.398 --> 42:24.118
Any luck with the baby-sitter?
Friday night curry with the girls?

42:29.878 --> 42:31.238
I'm sorry, Nige.

43:44.838 --> 43:46.117
Yeah?

43:46.118 --> 43:48.238
Sir, everyone's ready
in the briefing room.

43:53.478 --> 43:54.758
Right.

44:06.638 --> 44:08.558
I...

44:11.558 --> 44:13.598
Put it back
a couple of hours, please.

44:35.518 --> 44:37.717
Boss.

44:37.718 --> 44:39.398
Boss!

48:48.398 --> 48:50.557
Yeah.

48:50.558 --> 48:53.357
'I am giving you one last chance,

48:53.358 --> 48:56.278
'ya bent bastard.'

49:40.678 --> 49:44.437
Hello. 'You came to the salon.'
How did you get this number?

49:44.438 --> 49:48.477
'I know about the money. I can give
you the information you want.'

49:48.478 --> 49:51.837
Yeah? Well, how do
I know this isn't a load of crap?

49:51.838 --> 49:55.277
'There was a woman, Jackie.

49:55.278 --> 49:58.717
'She got her throat slashed
in the hall of her house.

49:58.718 --> 50:00.877
'There was a policeman with her.

50:00.878 --> 50:03.638
'Gates. He's in on all of it.

50:04.998 --> 50:07.077
'Only information.

50:07.078 --> 50:09.357
'No police station, no police.

50:09.358 --> 50:12.318
'No-one but you.' Where?

50:16.158 --> 50:20.718
Yeah? Great.
We'll come right now.

50:21.758 --> 50:26.157
We've got Wesley's stepbrother
in Interview Room One.

50:26.158 --> 50:29.438
What? Well, shouldn't we wait
for the boss to get back? No.

50:39.518 --> 50:41.517
Kate?

50:41.518 --> 50:42.718
Yeah, I'll be right there.

50:55.758 --> 50:59.518
Mr Boyle? It's the police.
You called us, sir.

51:01.758 --> 51:03.357
Can we come in, Terry?

51:03.358 --> 51:04.838
Yes. Come in.

51:12.478 --> 51:14.278
You said there'd been a break-in?

51:15.318 --> 51:19.077
Yes. I called 999 and they said
they wrote it all down.

51:19.078 --> 51:21.277
Well, how'd they get in?

51:21.278 --> 51:23.958
I let them in. Right.

51:25.198 --> 51:26.997
Er, what did they take, Terry?

51:26.998 --> 51:30.437
Crisps. Fi... fizzy drinks.

51:30.438 --> 51:32.117
They stole them?

51:32.118 --> 51:35.237
No, I gave them to them.

51:35.238 --> 51:36.838
Right.

51:37.878 --> 51:41.238
Well, what did they look like?
Just a moment, please.

51:51.238 --> 51:53.917
I'm very sorry,
but that's the secret signal

51:53.918 --> 51:57.277
that we've got a very, very
serious emergency to go to.

51:57.278 --> 52:00.317
If they come back, get their names
and contact the station.

52:00.318 --> 52:01.718
Thanks for your call.

52:11.158 --> 52:13.477
That's not a crime,
for Christ's sake.

52:13.478 --> 52:15.158
It's a social problem.

52:19.958 --> 52:23.757
Wesley was receiving a supply from
two men who resided at Greek Lane.

52:23.758 --> 52:27.197
No comment. Look, we're not trying
to pin anything on Wesley...

52:27.198 --> 52:29.397
we're trying to find out
who killed him.

52:29.398 --> 52:32.637
Did he ever say there was anything
unusual about these two blokes?

52:32.638 --> 52:34.918
Sorry, Nige, I'm busting.
I'll be back in a minute.

52:34.919 --> 52:38.597
Look, those lads that were found
dead in that flat,

52:38.598 --> 52:41.197
did they have any other mates?

52:41.198 --> 52:44.557
Arabs, maybe? Pakistanis?

52:44.558 --> 52:46.237
That you? 'What's happening?'

52:46.238 --> 52:48.718
I've seen how Jackie's business
laundered drug money.

52:48.719 --> 52:50.637
'500 quid for a bunch of bananas.

52:50.638 --> 52:53.277
'I'm on my way to meet an informant
to Gates being in on it.'

52:53.278 --> 52:56.317
Wait. Gates has gone AWOL. I saw him
setting something up with Morton.

52:56.318 --> 52:57.678
I don't know what it was but...

52:57.679 --> 53:00.998
Look, I need to move right now,
Kate. No more wobbles.

53:12.278 --> 53:13.918
Two identical phones.

53:14.918 --> 53:18.158
Don't bother saying
there's an innocent explanation.

53:22.678 --> 53:25.798
Where's Gates? What's he up to?

53:27.158 --> 53:30.878
Tony's shut me out. Because of you.

53:32.158 --> 53:35.757
D'you have any idea how that's felt?

53:35.758 --> 53:37.558
I couldn't give a shit.

53:38.798 --> 53:41.238
Argh!

53:49.158 --> 53:52.998
DC Fleming, are you all right?
Don't worry about me - get him!

54:42.038 --> 54:43.758
I wouldn't.

54:45.078 --> 54:46.678
This is pointless, Gates.

54:49.318 --> 54:52.158
It isn't about
me versus you any more.

54:53.318 --> 54:56.637
The people that Jackie was involved
with, they're all over me.

54:56.638 --> 55:00.598
Then get in the car.
Turn yourself in.

55:02.598 --> 55:05.118
I wish it was that simple.

55:18.878 --> 55:20.238
I'm sorry.

55:39.918 --> 55:42.438
For Christ's sake,
what are you playing at?!

55:43.598 --> 55:46.317
Bloody hell! Fleming?

55:46.318 --> 55:50.997
I'm AC-12. Call IT now and get them
to unlock this bloody computer.

55:50.998 --> 55:52.238
Now!

56:30.358 --> 56:32.478
'You were poking your nose
into my business.

56:33.518 --> 56:35.797
'This is how it's going to work...

56:35.798 --> 56:39.438
'you tell my lads what you know.
I'll be listening.'

56:52.278 --> 56:55.437
I can't.
Speak up, you div.

56:55.438 --> 56:58.717
I don't... What?

56:58.718 --> 57:00.398
Argh!

57:10.558 --> 57:14.117
This is Gates.

57:14.118 --> 57:16.757
Look, it's happening.
What you wanted, it's happening.

57:16.758 --> 57:18.797
Now you've got to give me
Jackie's body.

57:18.798 --> 57:20.877
'What, and ruin our relationship?'

57:20.878 --> 57:23.558
Just give...

57:27.718 --> 57:32.477
Give it! Give it! Open his hand out!
Get me that fucking finger!

57:32.478 --> 57:35.318
Who knows about our business?
More police?

57:37.878 --> 57:39.798
Phone.

57:56.318 --> 57:59.558
Who knows about our business?
Who? Who knows?

58:00.678 --> 58:02.718
What's wrong with these things?

58:14.638 --> 58:17.157
You bastards!

58:17.158 --> 58:20.637
You big bastard,
what you got to say now?

58:20.638 --> 58:23.838
I'm arresting you for grievous
bodily harm and false imprisonment.

58:23.863 --> 58:32.427
