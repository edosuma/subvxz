and five centimetres
left of the sternum.

12:10.280 --> 12:14.200
Seventeen centimetres.
Clean, confident cut.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.280
Confident?
You mean experienced?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.040
Mm, and in a quarry.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.040
Aztecs.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.200
Yes!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.360
The Aztecs sacrificed humans

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
to console the spirit of
the god monster Tlaltecuhtli

12:24.440 --> 12:26.360
who was torn apart
to create earth and sky.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.520
-This happens.
-I see.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.480
Tlaltecuhtli liked
her hearts beating,

12:29.520 --> 12:30.760
whereas Philippa here--

12:30.800 --> 12:32.520
Was dead before
she was cut open.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.960
Mm, and her heart
is still here.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
No, the killer wasn't
trying to remove her heart,

12:38.040 --> 12:39.920
he was removing something from
her heart.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.800
Like a bullet.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.720
Mm. If it was,
he knew exactly

12:43.760 --> 12:45.760
where to find it,
and that's lucky.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.480
[phone beeps]

12:47.520 --> 12:49.480
Let's remove
and sample her heart.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.480
I have to go.
I'll take these
to Scientific.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.240
Call me.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.400
She's nice.
Good in the room.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.520
She's horrible.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.480
She's a cop.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.040
They're just as bad
as pathologists.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.920
[bone saw whirs]

13:15.760 --> 13:20.240
OK. That's everything
ready for Histology.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.480
Can I close?

13:23.520 --> 13:24.520
Mm.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.120
Have we missed something?

13:29.160 --> 13:30.640
Like what?

13:30.680 --> 13:31.640
-[phone buzzing]
-Mm.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.680
Oh! Can you get that?

13:35.320 --> 13:37.080
Hi! Soroya.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.440
Oh, Harrow thinks
you're horrible.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.800
You're a pain
in the ass.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.640
Oh, horrible and
a pain in the ass.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.840
No, no, no, no, no.
Simon was dropped
on the head as a child.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.080
Hm. Here I was gonna
ask you for a drink.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.200
A drink?

13:54.240 --> 13:57.480
What, like
a drinkdrink,
at a bar?

13:57.520 --> 13:59.400
Like a drink-drink
at a bar.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.800
-When?
- Now.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.120
[Nichols]
Listen, we might need
a list of staff members

14:07.160 --> 14:08.680
that were working
on the night,

14:08.720 --> 14:10.880
and the last six months
as well would be--

14:10.920 --> 14:11.920
[door closes]

14:17.000 --> 14:19.640
-A word, Sergeant.
-[Dass] Yep.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.720
He is not one of us.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.680
I know that,
but I think
he could be helpful.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.800
-[Nichols] I understand
your position...
-You're popular.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.040
Yeah. But those
I don't kill,
I make stronger.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.680
[chuckles]

14:33.720 --> 14:36.640
You. Good grace
demands silence.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.720
Observe. Say nothing.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.720
Absolutely.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.280
So the guy you arrested
whose phone booked
Philippa Wedburg,

14:44.320 --> 14:46.160
this is where he claimed
he lost it?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.240
Yeah.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.040
These security cameras,
they work?

14:50.080 --> 14:52.000
Yeah. Yeah, in the back.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.760
[Harrow]
So, whoever
had the phone,

14:56.800 --> 14:58.920
did Wedburg
pick them up outside?

14:58.960 --> 15:01.600
Nope. No, it was booked
from a vacant lot

15:01.640 --> 15:03.240
on the other side
of the rail line.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.160
No cameras, no nothing.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.840
[Dass]
There. That guy
at the bar.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.440
Go back. Replay that.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.280
[Nichols]
Well, there's our lad Clark.
Half cut and then some.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.280
And his phone.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.880
[Nichols]
There.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.320
Well, that's as useful
as a chocolate teapot.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.480
What now?

15:31.520 --> 15:32.840
I'll get the uniforms
doorknocking

15:32.880 --> 15:34.480
for other cameras
on the street.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.400
[Nichols]
I'm gonna find
Mr. Check Shirt.

15:40.560 --> 15:41.560
[sighs]

15:42.960 --> 15:45.640
[Harrow] Why did you
invite me here?

15:45.680 --> 15:48.160
Heard about you
when I was still
in Melbourne.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.760
That you like
to get involved.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.680
Hm. What else did
you hear about me?

15:52.720 --> 15:55.080
That you don't listen.
You're conceited.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.920
Your shaving skills
are lacking.
You're a loose cannon.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.240
Still want to get
that drink?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.600
You took too long
to answer!

16:08.440 --> 16:10.680
Shit. Yes!

16:10.720 --> 16:11.920
We'll see.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.320
You're screwed.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.360
What do you mean?

16:17.960 --> 16:19.640
You're under her spell.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.520
How were drinks?

16:32.560 --> 16:34.240
Confusing.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.640
Hey, listen, are we
running chem tests

16:36.680 --> 16:39.400
on Wedburg's sternum skin
and sub-sternum tissue?

16:39.440 --> 16:41.360
No, I don't think so.
Why?

16:41.400 --> 16:44.920
In case she was shot.
Let's look for a bullet wipe.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.520
So maybe skip the bones
and do that before you go?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.960
Sure.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.360
Oh, and there's someone
here to see you.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.400
Good afternoon.
I'm Caterina Wedburg.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.280
Um, Philippa Wedburg's
daughter.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.200
Dan. Harrow.
Please, come and sit down.

17:08.680 --> 17:11.520
Um, she's in there,
the police said.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.320
Yeah, she is.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.720
Can I go see her, please?

17:18.480 --> 17:22.440
Well, you could.
She's your mother.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.280
But right now,
she's my patient.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.920
Patient?
You do the autopsies.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.680
You're not gonna
make her well.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.280
No.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.280
No one's going to make
your mum well again.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.520
It makes me very angry.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.840
And it makes me very sad.

17:43.880 --> 17:49.440
But... my job is not
to be angry or sad.

17:49.480 --> 17:53.560
My job is to find out
how she died...

17:53.600 --> 17:57.240
so we can find out
who did this.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.480
And I'm looking
at everything.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.200
And I'm taking care
of her, I promise.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.440
It's up to you.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.160
This one.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.600
-[rattling]
- Bingo.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.560
-Got it.

Everything gonna be
awright, girl.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.640
[chuckles]
Idiot.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.880
Fern.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.760
Didn't think my playing
was that bad.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.120
I came down with her
immunisation papers

19:22.160 --> 19:25.200
thinking you
might need them.
I find this.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.400
I ring Maxine.

19:27.440 --> 19:31.640
"Didn't Daniel resign?
Isn't he going
to Bora Bora?" "No!

19:31.680 --> 19:33.200
Harrow changed his mind."

19:33.240 --> 19:34.200
Steph--

19:34.240 --> 19:36.000
No! Just...

19:38.120 --> 19:40.120
She knows how much
you love that guitar.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.560
If this is what she does
on the outside--

19:47.400 --> 19:49.560
How could you
let her down like that?

19:49.600 --> 19:50.880
Again?

19:50.920 --> 19:51.920
It's...

19:57.280 --> 20:00.760

I'm gonna want to talk
to you for a while.

Oh! Don't do that!
I think I can get
this femur out.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.920
Leave that. Look at this.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.720
Ash. European ash.

21:59.760 --> 22:05.080
A wood favoured by
traditional European fletchers
for making arrow shafts.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.160
Wedburg was shot
by an arrow.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.080
Mm, think about it.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.120
If she were shot
with an arrow with,
say, a barbed head,

22:13.160 --> 22:15.920
it wouldn't pull out.
It would have to be
cut out.

22:15.960 --> 22:19.360
And in the process
of cutting it out,
the killer

22:19.400 --> 22:22.200
nicked off a bit
of arrow shaft.
European ash.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.520
OK.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.000
So, how are you
gonna find out

22:25.040 --> 22:26.480
who makes
European ash arrows?

22:26.520 --> 22:28.520
Oh, I'm not. You are.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.040

made of ash.

22:43.800 --> 22:47.200
And check in with
the organics lab.
They have the splinter.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.520
Well, if you already know
it's made of European ash,
then what are you looking for?

22:50.560 --> 22:52.280
I'll tell you when
I find it.

Get the door.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.320
I never told anyone this.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.440
Not even Pam.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.440
There was a girl
on my table.

24:29.480 --> 24:34.320
Exotic dancer, apparently.
Couldn't have been more
than 19.

24:34.360 --> 24:39.920
Impacted skull.
Broken hyoid.
Strangled.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.920
And I knew who did it.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.440
This copper.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.040
Evil, violent bastard.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.720
Then a second girl,
streetwalker,
turned up similar.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.840
And then a third.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.800
I knew it was this mongrel

24:57.840 --> 25:01.640
killing these girls,
but he was untouchable.

25:01.680 --> 25:05.440
Except...I had his blood.

He provided it
to exclude him from

was put a drop
of his blood

Nothing.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.040
I couldn't do it.

And it was six years
before he went down

and drawing the string
up to the nut.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.600
OK.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.040
European ash, which
I found in Ms. Wedburg,

28:04.080 --> 28:07.120
was commonly used
to make crossbow bolts.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.480
Commonly?
When, commonly?

28:09.520 --> 28:11.320
Middle Ages.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.000
A European medieval
crossbow bolt.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.880
It's not
an everyday item.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.560
A unique identifier.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.080
Which is why our killer
took the time to cut it
out of her.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.800
So, where do we find
a European crossbow bolt

28:23.840 --> 28:25.800
in not-medieval
not-Europe?

28:25.840 --> 28:28.600
Simon has his uses.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.400
[Man] Yeah, I sell
a few of 'em.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.120
Crossbows are
Category M weapons.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.400
Yeah, that's why
I check the licenses
of all my buyers.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.960
And I make sure I wait
the appropriate

28:44.000 --> 28:45.760
cooling-off period
before delivery,

28:45.800 --> 28:48.600
and I tell you lot
of all my sales.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.480
-Ash bolt.
-Yeah.

28:51.520 --> 28:55.040
-Maple vane?
-Yeah.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.600
Attached with
rabbit hide glue.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.880
What do you want?

29:02.920 --> 29:04.600
Do you know this woman?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.400
Been to Brisbane recently?

29:10.440 --> 29:13.320
I don't go to Brisbane.
It's shitty.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.280
Oh. You make the bows,
you sell the bows,

29:15.320 --> 29:18.840
and we trust you
to tell us
who buys the bows.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.440
I can see
a loophole or two.

29:22.480 --> 29:26.640
And if someone wanted
a bow, but didn't
want it reported?

29:26.680 --> 29:28.000
[sighs]

29:28.040 --> 29:31.480
You gave someone
a crossbow off the book.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.280
Who?

29:33.320 --> 29:34.400
I don't know anything.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.560
Hm.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.000
Well, I know that
illegally supplying

29:37.040 --> 29:39.080
a Category M weapon
could get you a 10K fine,

29:39.120 --> 29:42.280
and I also know that
supplying a restricted weapon

29:42.320 --> 29:45.480
that's been used
in a murder could get you
five years inside.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.040
VKR, this is Whisky 589--

29:51.080 --> 29:52.080
Wait.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.160
[moaning]

30:09.000 --> 30:11.360
What a naughty boy.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.960
Giving away a crossbow?

30:13.000 --> 30:16.560
Well, giving away
a crossbow for sex.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.720
Would you
break the law
for sex?

30:19.760 --> 30:22.440
-No.
-Not even a threesome?

30:25.000 --> 30:28.360
-[Nichols] Is this
your cosplay material?
- No. They brought it all.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.320
When did they
film this?

30:31.360 --> 30:32.960
About six months ago.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.760
[Nichols]
Did you get their names?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.560
They take off their masks?

30:38.600 --> 30:40.640
Well, yeah,
but not in the room.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.200
Can you describe them?

30:43.240 --> 30:45.160
-[moaning]
-Yeah, no, not really.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.920
Um, they were, you know...

30:47.960 --> 30:49.960
-What?
-Hot.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.920
Can you give me something?

30:52.960 --> 30:54.600
Were they a couple?

30:54.640 --> 30:56.800
Yeah, I think so.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.400
-[groaning]
-Ugh.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.440
What's that pattern?

31:07.480 --> 31:09.360
I don't know.
It's not clear.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.480
[howls]

31:14.440 --> 31:17.400
And they took
the crossbow
and bolts and left.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.280
There we go.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.720
[Nichols] See him?
Get onto the tech guys.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.720
I want to find that guy
and his girlfriend.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.880
Is this clear enough
for facial recognition?

31:33.920 --> 31:35.280
You bet your ass it is.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.080
[tyres screeching]

31:47.560 --> 31:50.120
[police radio chatter]

31:58.360 --> 32:00.880
Why are you releasing him?
Are you happy about this?

32:00.920 --> 32:03.280
No, but Wedburg's car
was a mess of DNA,

32:03.320 --> 32:06.600
and we didn't find
any of their DNA
on her clothes.

32:06.640 --> 32:10.120
Anna, the girlfriend,
denies being in the sex tape
with your bow maker.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.720
No crossbows or bolts
in their house.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.840
Although we did find
a heap of iffy shit.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.400
Iffy like what?

32:16.440 --> 32:20.440
Books. Black magic,
Druid stuff, lunar charts.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.360
Full moon.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.440
[no audible dialogue]

32:24.480 --> 32:26.120
Oh, this sucks.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.280
Settle down, tiger.
We'll get him.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.240
[phone ringing]

32:31.280 --> 32:32.280
Sorry.

32:55.160 --> 32:57.160
-[phone ringing]
-[police radio chatter]

32:59.960 --> 33:01.680
I'm sick to the nuts
of you, Harrow.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.480
What's wrong
with Blake Poyner's
left hand?

33:04.520 --> 33:07.480
How did you know--?

33:07.520 --> 33:11.640
OK, fine. Ah, Poyner
attempted suicide
as a teenager.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.640
He, uh, severed
the tendons
in his left wrist.

33:13.680 --> 33:17.200
But listen, Harrow, we've got this now, OK? Leave it alone.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.600
[knocks on door]

33:32.200 --> 33:34.680
-Yes?
-Anna, hi.
Daniel Harrow.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.400
Is Blake home?

33:36.440 --> 33:40.120
Uh, not yet. Excuse me,
I don't understand.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.120
You can't be here.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.280
You need help, Anna.

33:44.320 --> 33:47.440
Why? Are you a lawyer?
We can't afford a lawyer.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.760
Ah, what a terrible
business.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.240
Wasn't you in that
sex tape, was it?

33:57.400 --> 33:58.960
The police already
searched everything.

34:02.520 --> 34:03.800
Don't mind me.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.360
-This is Blake's stuff, right?
-[Poyner] It is.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.360
And you can't be here
without a warrant.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.320
Well, I'm not a cop.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.840
Well, then I can
break your face.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.880
What, with your
good hand?

34:41.920 --> 34:43.360
Blake...

34:45.880 --> 34:48.760
It wasn't you that shot
Philippa Wedburg, was it?

34:48.800 --> 34:51.920
And it sure wasn't
your girlfriend here.
So, who did?

34:53.120 --> 34:54.560
You'll never know.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.040
Someone's protecting you.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.320
Who made you that?

35:03.360 --> 35:04.960
She must be very special.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.640
You'll never know.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.640
-A candle.
-Yes.

35:17.680 --> 35:22.120
You ever heard of
the Cimetière des Saints-Innocents?

35:22.160 --> 35:24.760
Cemetery of
the Innocents.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.680
Paris, yes.

35:26.720 --> 35:30.720
In the late 1780s,
it was literally
overflowing with corpses.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.280
So it was closed,
and all the bodies,
thousands,

35:33.320 --> 35:36.480
were exhumed and moved
to a quarry, which
became catacombs.

35:36.520 --> 35:41.160
What was left were tons
of margaric acid.
A lake of human fat.

35:41.200 --> 35:44.600
So the government told
the soap makers

35:44.640 --> 35:46.240
and tallow chandlers
to have at it.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.120
Paris was not short
on candles that summer.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.360
What's that?

35:53.400 --> 35:54.520
The wick.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.960
Yeah, I get that.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.040
What's it made of?

36:01.160 --> 36:03.560
Human skin.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.480
And I want to know whose.

36:18.320 --> 36:21.840
Oh, Daniel, look at you.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.520
You used to be
such a handsome
young man.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.920
What happened?

36:25.960 --> 36:28.240
Life, Carol.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.440
Look...

36:30.480 --> 36:32.200
about that DNA
from the candle...

36:33.440 --> 36:34.520
Shut the door.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.480
We're avoiding
a scandal.

36:37.520 --> 36:40.640
Vice Chancellor does not
want splashed all over
social media

36:40.680 --> 36:42.600
the fact that
one of our students

36:42.640 --> 36:45.120
was caught stealing
cadaver parts.

36:45.160 --> 36:46.640
Caught and reprimanded?

36:46.680 --> 36:48.280
Caught and expelled.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.160
I don't suppose there's
any chance you could
tell me who it is?

37:08.240 --> 37:12.080
-[phone rings]
-It's Harrow.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.600
Remember that girl
from the bar?

37:33.200 --> 37:34.400
Charlotte?

38:00.120 --> 38:02.280
[chimes tinkle]

38:44.600 --> 38:48.320
[clatter]

38:51.320 --> 38:53.800
Did you follow me?

38:53.840 --> 38:56.400
'Cause I shook the cops,
but I didn't see you.

38:56.440 --> 38:59.720
I didn't follow you.
I worked it out.

38:59.760 --> 39:04.080
Oh, he's smart.

39:06.360 --> 39:09.480
Yes, my love.
He is smart.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, well, not everyone
appreciates it.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.320
Who else knows?

39:14.360 --> 39:17.000
Oh, heaps.
I'm a blabbermouth.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.440
Just kill him, love,
like you said.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.480
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.760
[Charlotte]
I think you're alone.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.040
I am.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.240
So what do you want?

39:32.160 --> 39:33.600
I want to know you.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.560
I want to know what it
feels like to hunt.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.800
[Philippa]
Just take the car.
Take it all.

39:46.920 --> 39:47.920
Run.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.360
Run!

39:52.360 --> 39:53.320
[cries]

39:53.360 --> 39:55.520
I want to know how it felt

39:55.560 --> 39:57.640
when you chased her
under the moonlight.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.920
-[barking]
-[Philippa screams]

40:01.960 --> 40:03.600
Like wolves.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.160
Like wolves.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.200
[barking]

40:08.920 --> 40:10.560
[snarling]

40:12.280 --> 40:14.920
[Philippa grunts,
whimpers]

40:14.960 --> 40:16.160
Let me.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.840
Blake wanted
to shoot her.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.960
But...

40:22.000 --> 40:23.240
His bad hand.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.360
[whimpering]

40:26.040 --> 40:27.000
Idiot.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.360
Oh, God, no!

40:35.520 --> 40:37.520
[groaning]

40:37.560 --> 40:39.560
[crying]

40:48.080 --> 40:51.080
Please!
I have a daughter!

40:51.120 --> 40:53.040
[crossbow fires]

40:53.080 --> 40:55.760
[Harrow]
You couldn't lift her
out of there.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.520
But you couldn't leave
the arrow inside her,

40:58.560 --> 40:59.560
so...

41:03.520 --> 41:05.400
punctures skin]

41:05.440 --> 41:07.120
I envy you--

41:07.160 --> 41:09.120
how you hunt.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.920
Just you, your bodies,

41:11.960 --> 41:15.920
your weapon of wood,
your power.

41:15.960 --> 41:19.600
The power in
that bright moment

41:19.640 --> 41:23.440
when you have your prey
within your sights.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.000
The choice is all yours.

41:27.240 --> 41:31.720
To spare a life...
or to take it.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.480
The power it takes
to pull that trigger,

41:37.520 --> 41:40.840
so small, so beautiful,

41:40.880 --> 41:44.080
that sends death
on your command.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.080
That's what I envy.

41:48.120 --> 41:52.400
The power in you that says,

41:52.440 --> 41:56.160
"Now is the time...

41:56.200 --> 41:58.480
to kill."

42:03.480 --> 42:04.480
Stop.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.520
Back.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.360
Get back.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.720
It's time to go.

42:12.760 --> 42:13.760
Let him.

42:16.200 --> 42:20.360
You missed the woman--
didn't you, Blake?--
but you won't miss me.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.560
Let him have his reward.

42:23.960 --> 42:28.240
He loves you.
He's under your spell.

42:28.280 --> 42:29.680
Take it, love.

42:38.440 --> 42:42.080
You're a clever man.
What a shame.

42:43.800 --> 42:46.040
I'm used to it.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.080
[bow cocks]

42:48.600 --> 42:51.120
-[Poyner] Kill him!
-[sirens approaching]

42:51.160 --> 42:52.360
Go!

42:54.360 --> 42:56.880
[sirens wailing]
[tyres screeching]

42:59.640 --> 43:00.600
Drop the knife!

43:00.640 --> 43:01.920
Put down the knife!

43:03.960 --> 43:06.400
Down! Get down!

43:06.440 --> 43:07.760
Down on the ground.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.120
[police radio chatter]

43:21.320 --> 43:22.920
[Harrow]
We're just in here.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.680
[inhales, exhales]

43:41.160 --> 43:42.240
OK.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.440
[gasps]

44:00.600 --> 44:03.200
[sniffles]
You did her hair.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.600
I had my assistant do it.

44:14.680 --> 44:16.480
Is there anything
you want to know?

44:19.600 --> 44:21.480
Do you think she was scared?

44:24.280 --> 44:25.760
Yes.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.640
But she tried to get away.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.400
Why her?

44:36.760 --> 44:38.520
Just bad luck.

44:38.560 --> 44:42.800
They ordered a ride.
They didn't care who was
behind the wheel.

44:42.840 --> 44:45.040
But you got them, right?

44:45.080 --> 44:49.120
Thanks to your mother,
we found what we needed.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.200
Yeah, we got 'em.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.400
[dogs barking]

45:16.120 --> 45:18.760
-Why would I
short-change you?
- I dunno.

45:18.800 --> 45:23.240
-What would happen
the next time I needed you?
-I dunno, mate. Hundred...

45:23.280 --> 45:26.640
Is this why they
kicked you out of
the force, Lewison?

45:26.680 --> 45:30.440
What's that,
healthy paranoia? Heh!

45:30.480 --> 45:32.320
Chronic stupidity.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.080
Heh.

45:34.120 --> 45:35.720
So what's her number?

45:40.880 --> 45:43.280
[sniffs]

45:48.720 --> 45:51.400
[muttering]

45:51.440 --> 45:52.440
All right.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.080
Good luck.
Yeah. [sniffs]

45:58.120 --> 46:00.600
Daughters are precious.

46:36.560 --> 46:37.560
Fern?

46:43.040 --> 46:44.040
Fern.

46:50.920 --> 46:52.400
Are you in there?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.280
I'm sorry.

47:07.680 --> 47:09.240
I wanted--

47:12.160 --> 47:13.160
[sighs]

47:15.200 --> 47:18.560
I still so much
want to go away
with you.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.160
And I wish I could
tell you why I can't.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.080
I was gonna tell you.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.320
I so want to
tell you, but...

47:36.720 --> 47:38.720
I think it's better
that I don't right now.

47:42.040 --> 47:45.200
And I'm not being
selfish this time,

47:45.240 --> 47:47.960
and I don't love
my work more than you.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.240
I don't love anything
more than you.

47:55.760 --> 47:58.840
Listen, if you're in there...

47:58.880 --> 48:01.200
let me in. Please?

48:10.240 --> 48:11.800
Idiot.

48:20.560 --> 48:21.560
[beep]

48:23.880 --> 48:27.240
-[Dass] So this is
the bony sections?
-[Simon] That's our femur.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.880
[Simon] It's heavier
than you'd think.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.680
It's a pretty
fine powder.

48:32.720 --> 48:37.360
Yeah, which we leave
for the technicians.

48:37.400 --> 48:40.720
So, you finally got
that femur out.
[clears throat]

48:40.760 --> 48:43.320
Sectioned, sampled,
and ready for analysis

48:43.360 --> 48:45.560
first thing
tomorrow morning.

48:45.600 --> 48:47.360
You don't look
too happy about that.

48:47.400 --> 48:49.640
Oh, no, I am.
That's great work on that.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.840
That'll really
speed things up. Heh.

48:51.880 --> 48:54.600
But, uh, it's late.
Why don't you go home
and see David?

48:54.640 --> 48:57.920
Half hour, tops.
I'll just go and
clean up Exam One.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.440
Are you OK?

49:03.800 --> 49:05.320
Yeah.

49:05.360 --> 49:06.400
Fine, uh...

49:06.440 --> 49:08.320
-I'm good.
-Mm.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.360
We're almost finished
here, apparently.

49:10.400 --> 49:13.200
If you're not busy,
maybe you want to
grab that drink?

49:15.360 --> 49:17.720
Or another night, maybe.

49:17.760 --> 49:20.640
Sorry. Yeah.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.880
[sighs] There's just
one more thing I need to do.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.040
Sure.

49:35.560 --> 49:36.800
[knocks]

50:11.920 --> 50:14.280
It's OK, Mr. Hovard.
It's OK.

50:29.520 --> 50:31.160
[sighs]

50:32.720 --> 50:33.720
[beep]

51:11.480 --> 51:13.200
[Harrow]
Next, onHarrow...

51:13.240 --> 51:15.360
I put the river bones
concrete through
the CAT scan.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.040
There's something there.

51:17.080 --> 51:19.200
[Jack] Whatever you've done,
your secret's safe.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.120
How awesome is getting
out of the office?

51:21.160 --> 51:22.720
I hate lizards.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.400
That cut's too neat.

51:24.440 --> 51:25.760
Crocodile teeth
didn't do that.

51:25.800 --> 51:28.400
[woman]
How could you not be?

51:28.440 --> 51:31.040
-Not be what?
-In love with her.

51:31.080 --> 51:32.880
I'm not in love with her.
I work with her.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.600
Jesus Christ, do they
let any idiot

51:34.640 --> 51:36.440
into medical school?

51:36.480 --> 51:38.720
You wouldn't want
to be taken by one of
those things, would you?

51:40.480 --> 51:42.480
[theme music plays]
