11:16.744 --> 11:18.779
THAT'S YOUR THIRD TIME TONIGHT.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.314
- WHO'S KEEPING SCORE?
- I AM.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.452
LOOK AT HIM, SO SMUG,
SO SELF-SATISFIED.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.087
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME
TO SEND HIM OFF

11:27.120 --> 11:30.057
WITH HIS NOT-UNATTRACTIVE TAIL
BETWEEN HIS LEGS.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.192
- WHAT THE FUCK FOR?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.094
YOU'VE GOT THE SON OF A BITCH
WHERE YOU WANT HIM

11:34.127 --> 11:35.863
WITH HIS ASS IN THE AIR,

11:35.896 --> 11:38.065
AND IT'S NOT A BAD ONE,
I MIGHT ADD.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.333
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
TELL!

11:40.367 --> 11:43.070
- WHAT THE HELL DOES HE KNOW?
FUCK!

11:43.103 --> 11:45.238
- WOULD YOU GET OFF MY BACK?
- HUH?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.240
- OH...

11:47.274 --> 11:48.942
NOTHING.
YOU'RE JUST, UH...

11:48.976 --> 11:49.943
GETTING A LITTLE
HEAVY, THAT'S ALL.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.211
- [chuckles]

11:51.244 --> 11:52.813
- OH. IT'S LIKE
THERE WAS SOMETHING

11:52.846 --> 11:55.148
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.956
- YEAH, ACTUALLY,
UH, THERE IS.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.892
- GO FOR IT, TEDDY.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.359
COME ON,
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.296
- YOU, UH...

12:13.266 --> 12:15.502
YOU WANT TO GO TO BABYLON
TOMORROW NIGHT?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.404
- [snide chuckle]

12:17.437 --> 12:19.907
- WHERE'S YOUR BACKBONE,
YOUR FORTITUDE?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.441
- WHERE'S THE LUBE?

12:21.474 --> 12:24.444
[Ride of the Valkyries
playing]

12:24.477 --> 12:28.415
*

12:35.188 --> 12:36.423
[keys rattling]

13:05.052 --> 13:06.453
- THE CLUB
WAS PACKED TONIGHT.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.555
- HMM. THAT'S NICE.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.290
- LINE ALL THE WAY
AROUND THE BLOCK.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.559
- GREAT.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.162
- BARELY ANY ROOM
ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

13:15.195 --> 13:19.199
- WHATEVER ELSE HAPPENS,
BY ALL MEANS KEEP ON DANCING.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.036
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, DEAR?
HOW WAS YOUR EVENING?

13:23.070 --> 13:26.573
- NOT NEARLY AS
EXCITING AS YOURS.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.842
I SPENT IT HERE....

13:28.876 --> 13:30.944
ALONE...

13:30.978 --> 13:32.345
THINKING.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.813
AND DON'T SAY,
"ALWAYS A DANGEROUS SIGN."

13:37.517 --> 13:40.854
I MADE SOME DECISIONS.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.055
- ABOUT WHAT?

13:42.089 --> 13:43.523
- MY LIFE.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.926
- AH.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.961
- WHAT I WANT.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.100
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD
ALREADY WORKED THAT OUT.

13:53.133 --> 13:57.204
YOU WERE GOING TO LIVE OFF YOUR
CONSIDERABLE HOLLYWOOD WEALTH

13:57.237 --> 13:59.339
AND TRY YOUR HAND
AT BEING AN ARTIST.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.108
- WHY ARE YOU
MAKING FUN OF ME?

14:01.141 --> 14:04.344
- I'M NOT MAKING FUN.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.146
LOOK, YOU'RE MAKING ME
FUCKING NERVOUS AS HELL,

14:06.179 --> 14:10.217
JUST...
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT...

14:10.250 --> 14:12.485
WHAT YOU'VE DECIDED.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.654
WE CAN GO TO BED
AND FUCK.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.089
- [scoffing]

14:16.123 --> 14:19.126
YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.094
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU.

14:21.128 --> 14:25.098
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.234
A HUSBAND.
A FAMILY.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.568
A HOME.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.504
ALL THE THINGS THAT
MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.274
- WOULD YOU FUCKING
CUT IT OUT?

14:34.307 --> 14:36.143
JUST STOP IT.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.580
[sighing]

14:40.613 --> 14:43.383
AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T
GIVE ME THOSE THINGS.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.684
- NOT "CAN'T."

14:44.717 --> 14:47.154
"CAN'T" IMPLIES
THAT I'M INCAPABLE.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.521
IT'S THAT I WON'T.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.325
- I ACCEPT THAT.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.994
I SUPPOSE, IT'S WHY
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.695
- [scoffs]

14:55.728 --> 14:57.664
OH, THE UNTAMABLE BEAST.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.666
- BUT TO BE A COUPLE,

14:59.699 --> 15:02.669
BOTH PEOPLE HAVE
TO WANT THE SAME THINGS,

15:02.702 --> 15:05.205
TO MOVE IN
THE SAME DIRECTION.

15:05.238 --> 15:09.142
IF THEY CAN'T
OR...OR WON'T...

15:09.176 --> 15:11.478
THEY REALLY HAVE
NOWHERE TO GO.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.283
- PROBABLY NOT.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.351
- THEN WHY ARE
WE STILL DOING THIS

15:18.385 --> 15:21.054
IF WE BOTH KNOW
IT'S NEVER GOING TO WORK?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.594
- DAMNED IF I KNOW.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.211
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:18.245 --> 16:19.679
- HMM...

16:19.712 --> 16:22.382
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

16:38.465 --> 16:42.001
[door opens]

16:43.270 --> 16:46.005
- LET ME KNOW.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.725
- OH, MY GOODNESS!

17:05.758 --> 17:07.260
YOU'VE TURNED
INTO A MONSTER.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.396
- CAREFUL, RON, YOUR BACK.
- [chuckling]

17:09.429 --> 17:12.799
HEY, PARTNER, YOU WANT
TO GO SEE YOUR ROOM?

17:12.832 --> 17:17.304
WOULD YOU LADIES
EXCUSE US GENTS?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.705
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU
HE'D BE THRILLED?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.807
- MOM!
- WHAT?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.542
- YOU HAVE
MY PROM PICTURE OUT.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.344
- I'VE ALWAYS LOVED
THAT PICTURE.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.480
- [groans]
LOOK AT THAT HAIR AND THAT GOWN.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.416
[whimpers]
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.684
- NOT TO ME.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.553
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I COME IN HERE

17:33.586 --> 17:34.821
AND I JUST SIT.

17:34.854 --> 17:38.158
- YOU DO?
- SOMETIMES I FEEL

17:38.191 --> 17:41.094
IT'S ALL I HAVE
LEFT OF YOU.

17:44.797 --> 17:48.368
- THANKS, MOM,
FOR BEING SO GENEROUS.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.704
- IT'S OUR PLEASURE,
DARLING.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.340
BY THE WAY,

17:53.373 --> 17:55.242
WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE
COMING FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.577
I MEAN, NOTHING FORMAL,
JUST AL AND LOIS SEGGERMAN

17:57.610 --> 17:59.246
AND SOMEONE FROM
DAD'S OFFICE.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.580
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T BE IN THE WAY.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.449
I'LL STAY UP HERE,
TAKE A BATH, READ.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.650
- I WAS HOPING
YOU'D JOIN US.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.519
- OH, IT'S BEEN
A LONG DAY AND...

18:06.553 --> 18:09.622
- I UNDERSTAND.
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.458
BUT IF YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND,

18:11.491 --> 18:14.894
ELVIRA'S MAKING YOUR FAVORITE,
SALMON IN DILL SAUCE.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.730
I TOLD HER IT WAS
YOUR WELCOME-HOME DINNER.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.267
- AW, THEN I SUPPOSE
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.502
- IT'S SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.633
- YOU READING
THE DVD TITLES?

18:53.666 --> 18:56.536
I DO THAT SOMETIMES TO MAKE SURE
I DON'T NEED GLASSES.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.171
SINGIN' IN THE RAIN,

18:58.205 --> 18:59.806
SOME LIKE IT HOT,

18:59.839 --> 19:02.509
DIRTY HARRY.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.277
HOW DID THAT GET THERE?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.378
OH, YEAH, I REMEMBER.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.146
I THOUGHT IT
WAS A PORN FILM.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.319
HEY, JOKING.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.289
OKAY, IT WASN'T
VERY FUNNY.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.191
HOW ABOUT YOU COME WITH ME
TO BED BATH AND BEGONE?

19:18.225 --> 19:19.792
I'M BUYING THROW PILLOWS
FOR THE BED.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.695
THE QUEER GUY SAYS IT'S
A STYLISH AND INEXPENSIVE WAY

19:22.729 --> 19:27.400
TO ACCENTUATE THE COLOR SCHEME
AND ENLIVEN A ROOM.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.935
OF COURSE...

19:28.968 --> 19:32.939
WE DON'T NEED PILLOWS
TO ENLIVEN A ROOM, DO WE?

19:32.972 --> 19:34.607
BEN?

19:34.641 --> 19:38.278
- I REMEMBER WATCHING
THOSE MOVIES WITH HUNTER.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.548
HE'D NEVER EVEN HEARD OF
SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.451
HE LOVED IT.
MUST'VE SEEN IT 95 TIMES.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.953
- AND THAT WAS
EVEN AFTER HE WASN'T GAY.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.555
PLEASE COME WITH ME.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.723
- EVERYTHING IN THIS HOUSE
REMINDS ME OF HIM.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.592
EVERYWHERE I LOOK.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.561
- THAT'S WHY IT MIGHT BE A GOOD
IDEA TO GET OUT FOR A WHILE.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.630
YOU KNOW, TAKE
YOUR MIND OFF OF THINGS.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.470
LISTEN, THERE'S A MEETING AT
THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER

20:03.503 --> 20:06.306
TOMORROW NIGHT
ABOUT THIS PROPOSITION 14.

20:06.339 --> 20:09.309
- SO?
- SO WE SHOULD GO.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.910
THEY'RE GOING
TO NEED VOLUNTEERS.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.313
WHO BETTER THAN SOMEONE
AS INTELLIGENT, WELL-INFORMED,

20:13.346 --> 20:15.982
AUTHORITATIVE, AND NOT
TO MENTION HOT, AS YOU?

20:16.015 --> 20:17.617
- THE LAST THING I WANT
TO THINK ABOUT RIGHT NOW

20:17.650 --> 20:19.319
IS ANOTHER GAY CAUSE.

20:19.352 --> 20:22.722
- IT'S NOT JUST
ANOTHER GAY CAUSE.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.591
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,

20:24.624 --> 20:26.359
YOU SAID THAT THIS WAS
JUST THE BEGINNING.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.729
WELL, NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.465
LISTEN, I'M JUST AS UPSET
ABOUT THIS AS YOU ARE.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.334
EVERY TIME I HEAR
THAT DOOR OPEN

20:34.367 --> 20:39.639
OR THE PHONE RING,
I THINK IT'S HIM.

20:39.672 --> 20:40.940
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE US
BOTH FEEL BETTER

20:40.973 --> 20:43.009
IF WE GOT INVOLVED
IN SOMETHING.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.811
- I DON'T WANT TO
GET INVOLVED IN SOMETHING, OKAY?

20:44.844 --> 20:46.746
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT PROPOSITION 14

20:46.779 --> 20:48.047
OR 15 OR 16.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.783
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS WHERE IS HE?
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

20:50.817 --> 20:53.420
AM I EVER GOING TO
SEE HIM AGAIN?

20:53.453 --> 20:55.955
SO LET SOMEBODY ELSE
SIT ON THAT GODDAMN COMMITTEE.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.958
I'VE GIVEN ENOUGH.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.363
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE LET YOU WALK OUT

21:03.396 --> 21:05.298
AND DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO STOP YOU.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.966
- I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.768
- WELL, IF EITHER OF YOU
HAD EVER BOTHERED

21:08.801 --> 21:10.069
TO READ JACKIE COLLINS,

21:10.102 --> 21:11.838
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT,
IN THE LAST CHAPTER,

21:11.871 --> 21:14.441
THE HERO FINALLY REALIZES
THAT HE HAS LOVED THE HEROINE--

21:14.474 --> 21:16.543
IN THIS CASE,
THE HEROINE BEING YOU--

21:16.576 --> 21:18.911
ALL ALONG,
AND BEGS HER TO STAY.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.847
- THAT'S WHY
IT'S CALLED FICTION.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.915
- FIGHT PROPOSITION 14!
- THANKS.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.984
- THERE'S A MEETING TOMORROW
AT THE CENTER.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.954
- YOU PEOPLE NEED JESUS
IN YOUR LIVES.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.323
- YEAH, AND YOU NEED
A GOOD BLOW-JOB.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.958
THAT IS, IF YOU CAN
FIND ANYONE TO GIVE YOU ONE,

21:31.991 --> 21:33.560
AND DON'T LOOK AT ME.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.396
- THAT NO-GOOD SON OF A BITCH.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.465
HOW COULD HE DO THAT TO YOU
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

21:38.498 --> 21:40.066
- HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.934
I WANTED ONE THING
AND HE WANTED ANOTHER.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.336
AND SINCE NEITHER ONE OF US

21:43.370 --> 21:44.571
COULD GIVE THE OTHER
WHAT HE NEEDED,

21:44.604 --> 21:47.807
WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE
BEST TO MOVE ON.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.809
- SO WHERE'RE YOU
GOING TO GO?

21:49.842 --> 21:51.678
- YOU COULD ALWAYS COME BACK
TO DEBBIE'S BOARDING HOUSE,

21:51.711 --> 21:53.480
SHARE EMMETT'S ROOM.

21:53.513 --> 21:56.449
- HEY, UM, PERHAPS, EMMETT WOULD
LIKE TO BE CONSULTED ON THAT?

21:56.483 --> 21:58.017
- DON'T WORRY, I ALREADY
HAVE IT WORKED OUT.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.118
I'M GOING TO STAY
WITH BEN AND MICHAEL

21:59.151 --> 22:00.587
UNTIL I GET A PLACE OF MY OWN.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.089
- A PLACE OF YOUR OWN?
AT YOUR AGE?

22:03.122 --> 22:04.491
- DEB, I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.426
- YOU WERE NEVER A KID.

22:06.459 --> 22:10.096
- I KNOW, BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE A KID TO ME.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.465
- BESIDES IT'S TIME
I MADE IT ON MY OWN.

22:12.499 --> 22:15.602
- LIKE MARY.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.572
- AND EVEN THOUGH
I'LL MISS BRIAN

22:19.606 --> 22:21.708
AND I'LL WISH WE WERE
STILL TOGETHER...

22:21.741 --> 22:23.876
THIS'LL BE GOOD FOR ME.
RIGHT?

22:23.910 --> 22:26.713
- RIGHT.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.347
- YEAH, DAMN...
DAMN RIGHT.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.618
- VOTE NO ON
PROPOSITION 14!

22:31.651 --> 22:32.885
- YEAH, THANKS.
- THANK YOU.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.787
- NO ON 14.
MEETING AT THE CENTER.

22:34.821 --> 22:38.925
- OH, EXCUSE ME, FOLKS,
I GOT TO GO PEE AGAIN.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.761
DAMN PROSTATE.
- AL, PLEASE.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.530
- OH, DON'T BE
EMBARRASSED, HONEY.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.498
IT'S NOT AS IF I BROUGHT UP
MY HEMORRHOIDS.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.534
[all chuckling]

22:47.567 --> 22:50.470
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
AL IS AL.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.905
- I'M AFRAID I'M
A LITTLE YOUNG FOR THIS CROWD.

22:52.939 --> 22:55.542
MY PROSTATE'S STILL
IN WORKING ORDER.

22:55.575 --> 22:58.044
BUT I'D BE GLAD TO SHOW YOU
MY TENNIS ELBOW IF YOU LIKE.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.912
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.

22:59.946 --> 23:03.149
SO YOU WORK WITH MY DAD?
- GOING ON FIVE YEARS NOW.

23:03.182 --> 23:06.152
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.421
AND YOU? YOU WORK
AT THE SIDNEY BLOOM GALLERY?

23:08.455 --> 23:09.822
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.524
- I DON'T GET MUCH TIME
TO GO TO GALLERIES,

23:11.558 --> 23:13.693
BUT I DID MANAGE TO CATCH
THE SAM AUERBACH SHOW.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.762
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT?

23:15.795 --> 23:18.565
- ACTUALLY, I PUT IT TOGETHER.
- REALLY?

23:18.598 --> 23:20.933
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.935
AND THE MURAL DOWN
AT PENN PLAZA IS...

23:22.969 --> 23:24.671
IT'S A KNOCK-OUT.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.639
BUT OF COURSE,
I'M NOT AN EXPERT.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.775
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
AN EXPERT TO KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.176
I HAPPEN TO
AGREE WITH YOU.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.211
IT'S BOLD,
LARGER THAN LIFE,

23:32.244 --> 23:34.947
COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE,

23:34.981 --> 23:36.449
MUCH LIKE THE MAN.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.984
AND LIKE THE MAN,

23:38.017 --> 23:40.553
BEST APPRECIATED
FROM A SAFE DISTANCE.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.223
- THE OLD FOLKS ARE GOING
TO BORE THEMSELVES

23:44.256 --> 23:46.459
WITH PICTURES FROM
THEIR ALASKAN CRUISE.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.528
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
MAKE YOUR ESCAPE

23:48.561 --> 23:50.062
AND WE'LL CALL
YOU FOR DESSERT?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.831
- OKAY.
- [chuckling]

23:53.165 --> 23:55.835
*

23:55.868 --> 23:57.804
- TEDDY!

23:57.837 --> 24:00.573
- OH. HI, EM.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.742
- ENOUGH WITH ALL THE GREETINGS
AND SALUTATIONS.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.577
I WANT DETAILS.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.012
HOW DID IT GO
WHEN YOU TOLD HIM?

24:06.045 --> 24:07.980
DID HE DIE OF SHAME?

24:08.014 --> 24:09.749
WILL I BE CATERING
THE MEMORIAL SERVICE?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.584
- WILL YOU STOP WITH
ALL THE QUESTIONS?

24:15.888 --> 24:17.890
- OH, MY GOD!

24:17.924 --> 24:19.091
- WHAT?

24:19.125 --> 24:20.993
- IT'S JUST WHAT
I WAS AFRAID OF.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.729
I CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR EYES.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.096
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:24.130 --> 24:27.567
- YOU'VE FALLEN FOR HIM,
HAVEN'T YOU?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.135
ADMIT IT. IT'S TRUE.
- HEY, LOOK. HERE'S BRIAN.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.103
BRI. BUDDY.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.874
- BRIAN, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

24:34.907 --> 24:36.976
- "WHY AM I HERE?"
HMM.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.845
THAT'S A QUESTION
THAT PHILOSOPHERS,

24:38.878 --> 24:41.748
SCIENTISTS, AND THEOLOGIANS
HAVE BEEN ASKING THEMSELVES

24:41.781 --> 24:44.016
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.852
THE BEST I CAN COME UP WITH IS,
WE LIVE IN PITTSBURGH.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.720
WHERE THE HELL ELSE
AM I GOING TO GO?

24:47.754 --> 24:49.288
- I BELIEVE WHAT EMMETT MEANS IS
WE DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU,

24:49.321 --> 24:52.024
CONSIDERING YOU AND
JUSTIN BROKE UP.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.061
- YOU MUST BE DEVASTATED.
- WE'RE SO SORRY.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.896
- THANKS FOR THE SYMPATHIES.

24:56.929 --> 24:57.897
ANOTHER.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.265
AND THE CONDOLENCES, BUT...

24:59.298 --> 25:00.767
I'M NOT DEVASTATED,

25:00.800 --> 25:03.770
AND YOU'RE NOT SORRY,
SO PLEASE...

25:03.803 --> 25:08.040
SPARE ME THE SENTIMENTS
AND THE SENTIMENTALITY.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.676
- WELL, IT'S A RELIEF TO KNOW
YOU WON'T BE

25:09.709 --> 25:11.778
DYING OF A BROKEN HEART
ANY TIME SOON.

25:11.811 --> 25:15.081
- SILLY OF US
TO EVEN THINK YOU HAD ONE.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.183
- I'M DOING JUST FINE.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.685
- YEAH, WE CAN SEE.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.920
- AND I'M SURE
JUSTIN IS TOO.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.055
- UH, HE'S DOING
BETTER THAN FINE.

25:23.089 --> 25:26.325
HE'S PICKED HIMSELF UP,
DUSTED HIMSELF OFF, AND...

25:26.358 --> 25:28.928
STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.963
- GLAD TO HEAR IT.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.099
BE SURE AND GIVE HIM MY REGARDS
THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE HIM.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.834
- YOU CAN TELL HIM YOURSELF,

25:34.867 --> 25:37.904
NEXT TIME YOU'RE OVER
AT MICHAEL AND BEN'S.

25:37.937 --> 25:41.340
- HE'S MOVED IN WITH THEM.

25:41.373 --> 25:49.348
*

25:49.381 --> 25:50.583
- ANOTHER.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.055
- SO I SAID TO HIM,

25:56.088 --> 25:57.990
"WYATT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CANCEL YOUR PLAYDATE

25:58.024 --> 26:00.660
BECAUSE YOUR FRIEND CAN'T
COME OVER TODAY."

26:00.693 --> 26:03.062
AND HE SAID,
AND I SWEAR...

26:03.095 --> 26:05.331
"DADDY, I CAN PLAY
WITH MY OTHER FRIEND."

26:05.364 --> 26:07.967
AND I SAID, "WHAT
OTHER FRIEND?"

26:08.000 --> 26:10.236
AND THAT'S WHEN
HE SHOWED ME.

26:10.269 --> 26:13.740
- [laughs] NO!
- OH, YES!

26:13.773 --> 26:15.675
THAT'S WHAT HE CALLS HIS PENIS:
HIS "FRIEND."

26:15.708 --> 26:16.743
- OHH.
- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.945
HE'S FIVE.

26:18.978 --> 26:23.282
- OH, THANK GOD GUS HASN'T
DISCOVERED HIS "FRIEND" YET.

26:23.315 --> 26:26.285
- AND SO WHEN I TOLD MY EX,
SHE GOT ALL UPSET ABOUT IT,

26:26.318 --> 26:28.254
WANTED HIM TO
GO TO A SHRINK.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.956
AND BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WAS FUNNY,

26:29.989 --> 26:32.859
SHE THOUGHT I SHOULD
GO TO A SHRINK.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.226
AND THEN IT TURNED
INTO A COMPETITION

26:34.260 --> 26:36.128
ABOUT WHO'S
A BETTER PARENT AND...

26:36.162 --> 26:38.297
- I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT,
BELIEVE ME.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.735
- WOULD YOU MIND IF I STOPPED BY
YOUR GALLERY SOME AFTERNOON

26:42.769 --> 26:44.003
AND TOOK YOU TO LUNCH?

26:45.738 --> 26:47.106
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.374
- WHAT ABOUT THURSDAY?

26:48.407 --> 26:51.911
- THURSDAY'S FINE.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.713
ALTHOUGH JUST
TO BE FAIR,

26:53.746 --> 26:56.315
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.719
I'M A LESBIAN.

26:59.752 --> 27:00.753
- OH.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.055
- IF THAT'S A PROBLEM...

27:03.089 --> 27:07.059
- UH, NO, IT'S...
NO, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.797
IT'S...IT'S JUST NOT EXACTLY
WHAT YOUR PARENTS TOLD ME

27:10.830 --> 27:12.799
WHEN THEY INVITED ME
FOR DINNER.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.136
- WHAT EXACTLY DID
THEY TELL YOU?

27:17.169 --> 27:19.271
- UH, THEY SAID THAT
YOU'D JUST BROKEN UP...

27:19.305 --> 27:21.340
WITH A MAN. HUH.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.192
- WHOO!

27:40.226 --> 27:45.364
HEY, HOT GUY!
- HEY, THERE YOU ARE!

27:45.397 --> 27:46.833
- HMM!

27:46.866 --> 27:49.335
OH, I BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.704
I WANT THEM
TO MEET YOU.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.840
- WELL, ANY FRIEND OF YOURS
IS A FRIEND OF MINE.

27:55.742 --> 27:58.711
- AUNT PITY FUCK!
AUNT PITY FUCK!

28:00.947 --> 28:02.949
- WHO'S THAT?
- SOME FREAK!

28:06.418 --> 28:10.122
- COME ON...
- TROY.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.090
- UH, HEY...

28:12.524 --> 28:13.993
REMEMBER ME?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.195
WE HOOKED UP A FEW MONTHS AGO?

28:16.228 --> 28:20.967
- SURE. RIGHT, RIGHT
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.202
SO, UH, HOW WAS I?

28:23.235 --> 28:26.005
- HOT. YOU SAID
YOU'D CALL BUT...

28:26.038 --> 28:28.474
I GUESS YOU LOST
MY NUMBER SO...

28:28.507 --> 28:30.877
I'LL GIVE IT
TO YOU AGAIN.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.078
PROMISE NOT TO LOSE IT?

28:32.111 --> 28:34.847
- WORD OF HONOR.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.890
FUCKING LOSERS.

28:43.923 --> 28:47.159
THEY JUST DON'T
GET IT, DO THEY?

28:47.193 --> 28:48.494
YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS,

28:48.527 --> 28:51.263
I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.032
I CAN'T HELP IT.
IT'S MY NATURE.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.001
SO OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF MY HEART,

28:55.034 --> 28:56.502
I HAVE SEX WITH THEM.

28:56.535 --> 28:59.839
GIVE THEM SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER FOR A RAINY DAY.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.841
BUT IT'S NEVER ENOUGH.

29:01.874 --> 29:02.775
THEY'RE PITIFUL.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.011
FUCKING PITIFUL.

29:05.044 --> 29:10.116
- YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.284
I WAS ONE OF THEM.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.987
- WHAT?
WELL, YOU'RE HOT.

29:15.021 --> 29:18.057
- YEAH? WELL, YOU
DIDN'T THINK SO THEN.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.027
PRIDE? 2002?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.999
- I THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT YOU.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.901
- YEAH, I WAS ONE
OF YOUR PITY FUCKS,

29:28.935 --> 29:33.205
A FACT YOU MADE
PAINFULLY CLEAR.

29:33.239 --> 29:36.408
BUT GUESS WHAT?

29:36.442 --> 29:39.011
NOW YOU'RE MINE.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.147
HEY, DON'T LOOK
SO BEWILDERED.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.915
I SOUGHT YOU OUT.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.384
I WAITED FOR
THE RIGHT MOMENT.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.355
I GUESS THIS IS IT.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.326
HMM.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.428
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

29:56.462 --> 29:59.165
- 'FRAID NOT.

29:59.198 --> 30:02.434
BUT, HEY, LOOK
AT IT THIS WAY.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.803
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.239
- YOU'RE DUMPING ME?

30:07.273 --> 30:09.942
- IT'S A FAG-EAT-FAG WORLD.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.246
- FUCK YOU.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.519
YOU KNOW...

30:20.552 --> 30:23.622
I LIKED YOU...

30:23.655 --> 30:27.326
A LOT.

30:27.359 --> 30:31.830
I REALLY DID.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.288
[knock at door]

30:56.322 --> 30:59.225
- JESUS CHRIST!
I'M COMING!

30:59.258 --> 31:01.160
[banging on door]

31:01.193 --> 31:03.029
OKAY, O...

31:03.062 --> 31:04.363
OKAY!

31:04.396 --> 31:06.532
[pounding on door]
JESUS...

31:06.565 --> 31:11.237
WOULD YOU STOP ALREADY?

31:11.270 --> 31:13.372
BRIAN.
- EXCELLENT, PROFESSOR.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.408
YOU RECOGNIZE THE SUBJECT
AND CAN IDENTIFY HIM BY NAME.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.377
- WE'VE GONE TO BED.
- THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.646
THE STEPFORD HUSBANDS
TURN IN EARLY.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.448
- GET IN HERE. YOU'LL WAKE
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.

31:22.481 --> 31:26.318
- HMM.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.921
I WANT TO SEE YOUR WIFE.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.323
WHERE IS THE LITTLE WOMAN?
I MEAN, LITTLE HUSBAND?

31:31.357 --> 31:32.925
- IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO MICHAEL...

31:32.959 --> 31:34.293
- WHO THE FUCK ELSE
WOULD I BE REFERRING TO?

31:34.326 --> 31:36.996
- HE'S ASLEEP.
- ROUSE HIM.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.031
WAKE HIM UP.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.166
MICHAEL, YOU GET YOUR ASS DOWN--
- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.134
YOU BETTER GO.
YOU BETTER GO.

31:42.168 --> 31:43.135
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
- NO, I SAID YOU'RE LEAVING.

31:43.169 --> 31:44.570
- MICHAEL!

31:44.603 --> 31:46.138
- I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR
DRUNKEN ASS OUT OF MY HOUSE.

31:46.172 --> 31:49.175
- BEN, IT'S OKAY.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.379
I'LL HANDLE IT.
JUST GO TO BED.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.984
- YOU SURE?

32:00.619 --> 32:03.189
- WELL, MIKEY.

32:03.222 --> 32:06.158
CONGRATULATIONS.
- FOR WHAT?

32:06.192 --> 32:08.027
- YOU WON.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.962
TO THE SPOILER
GOES THE VICTORY.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.563
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.100
- OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.235
NO ONE PLAYS DEWY-EYED INNOCENT
BETTER THAN YOU,

32:16.268 --> 32:18.170
ALTHOUGH AT 34,

32:18.204 --> 32:19.972
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT LONG
IN THE TOOTH FOR SHORT PANTS.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.241
- SPEAKING OF OUT-GROWING
YOUR ACT,

32:22.274 --> 32:24.243
NOTHING'S MORE PATHETIC, TO USE
ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE WORDS,

32:24.276 --> 32:25.711
THAN AN OVER-THE-HILL CLUB BOY.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.679
- [snickering]

32:30.749 --> 32:33.452
YOU INFECTED HIM...

32:33.485 --> 32:35.054
WITH YOUR PETTY,
BOURGEOIS,

32:35.087 --> 32:39.458
MEDIOCRE, CONFORMIST,
ASSIMILATIONIST LIFE.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.193
THANKS TO YOU,
HE'S GOT VISIONS

32:41.227 --> 32:43.729
OF BABIES, WEDDINGS,
WHITE PICKET FENCES

32:43.762 --> 32:45.331
DANCING IN
HIS BLOND LITTLE HEAD.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.365
- AND YOU THINK
I PUT THEM THERE.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.599
- BEFORE YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND

32:47.633 --> 32:48.600
TIED THE NOOSE
AROUND YOUR NECKS,

32:48.634 --> 32:50.336
HE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY!

32:50.369 --> 32:52.104
BUT NOW HE'S A DEFECTOR,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF YOU.

32:52.138 --> 32:56.208
- HE WAS NEVER PERFECTLY HAPPY.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.276
WAITING FOR YEARS

32:57.309 --> 32:58.610
FOR YOU TO SAY,
"I LOVE YOU.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.279
YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE I WANT."

33:00.312 --> 33:03.015
- THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.650
- DON'T WE ALL KNOW!

33:09.455 --> 33:12.358
- AND NOW HE'S HERE
IN YOUR HOUSE...

33:12.391 --> 33:14.626
- IT'S A HOME.
- IT'S A FARCE!

33:14.660 --> 33:16.628
IT'S A FREAK SHOW.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.264
- CALL IT WHAT
YOU WANT,

33:18.297 --> 33:20.499
I HONESTLY DON'T CARE.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.502
BUT HE DIDN'T LEAVE
BECAUSE I INFECTED HIM.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.137
HE LEFT BECAUSE OF YOU.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.141
WHO WOULDN'T?

33:47.493 --> 33:49.128
[door slams]

33:49.161 --> 33:51.063
[rapping on door]
- KNOCK, KNOCK.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.065
JUST WANTED
TO SAY GOOD NIGHT.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.666
DID YOU ENJOY DINNER?

33:54.700 --> 33:57.203
- ELVIRA'S SALMON
WAS DELICIOUS.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.138
- AL AND LOIS COULDN'T
STOP RAVING

33:59.171 --> 34:00.672
ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL
YOU LOOK.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.408
- WELL, THAT'S NICE.

34:02.441 --> 34:05.544
- AND STEPHEN'S QUITE CHARMING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

34:05.577 --> 34:07.813
- YES. QUITE.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.815
- GOOD NIGHT, DARLING.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.183
SLEEP WELL.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.222
- MOM?

34:16.255 --> 34:17.189
- HMM?

34:19.591 --> 34:21.493
- WHY DID YOU INVITE HIM
HERE TONIGHT?

34:21.527 --> 34:22.828
- HE'S YOUR FATHER'S
ASSOCIATE.

34:22.861 --> 34:24.863
WE'VE BEEN MEANING TO
HAVE HIM OVER,

34:24.896 --> 34:27.766
AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
HAVING SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.235
- OH, THAT WAS
VERY THOUGHTFUL.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.237
- YOU SEEMED TO
BE ENJOYING YOURSELF.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.571
- I LIKED HIM VERY MUCH.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.206
- I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.508
- BUT NOT IN THAT WAY.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.577
I'M A LESBIAN, MOTHER.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.346
YOU KNOW THAT.

34:40.379 --> 34:43.315
- I THOUGHT THAT
WAS ALL OVER WITH.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.650
- "ALL OVER WITH"?

34:44.683 --> 34:47.353
- YOUR SISTER TOLD ME
YOU WERE WITH A MAN.

34:47.386 --> 34:50.589
- THAT CUNT.
- LINDSAY!

34:50.622 --> 34:52.624
- THAT HAPPENED ONCE
AND IT WAS A MISTAKE.

34:52.658 --> 34:55.227
- AND WHY WAS IT A MISTAKE?

34:55.261 --> 34:57.396
PERHAPS IF YOU HAD
GIVEN IT MORE TIME,

34:57.429 --> 34:59.865
YOU MIGHT FINALLY HAVE HAD
A MATURE RELATIONSHIP.

34:59.898 --> 35:03.735
- I'VE HAD A MATURE
RELATIONSHIP.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.737
- [sighing]
WITH THAT PERSON?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.639
- MELANIE, MOTHER.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.208
NOT "THAT PERSON."

35:09.241 --> 35:11.610
AND YES, SHE WAS MY PARTNER
FOR TEN YEARS.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.379
AND THAT'S A HELL
OF A LOT LONGER THAN

35:13.412 --> 35:17.349
ANY OF THOSE THREE MARRIAGES
MY DARLING SISTER HAS HAD.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.485
WE HAVE TWO CHILDREN TOGETHER.

35:19.518 --> 35:23.255
AND IF THAT'S
NOT A MATURE...

35:23.289 --> 35:25.924
I CAN'T BELIEVE I STILL HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS WITH YOU.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.395
- I'M SORRY, DEAR.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.631
BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.534
IT ISN'T.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.670
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR RELATIONS WITH A MAN,

35:38.704 --> 35:43.175
I WAS HOPING THAT...
- WHAT?

35:43.209 --> 35:45.611
THAT I'D BE THE DAUGHTER
YOU ALWAYS DREAMT OF?

35:47.613 --> 35:50.682
WELL, I'M NOT, MOM.

35:50.716 --> 35:54.386
AND I NEVER WILL BE.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.823
SO IF THAT'S WHY YOU ASKED ME
TO COME LIVE HERE...

35:57.856 --> 36:00.526
THEN I'M AFRAID
I'VE DISAPPOINTED YOU...

36:00.559 --> 36:03.429
ONCE AGAIN.

36:06.965 --> 36:14.906
*

36:40.332 --> 36:43.869
- WHAT'S UP, BOSS?

36:43.902 --> 36:47.005
- YOU SEE THAT?

36:47.038 --> 36:48.574
- HOW COULD I MISS IT?

36:48.607 --> 36:51.477
- WELL, ARE YOU GOING TO
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

36:51.510 --> 36:53.712
- THE KID'S HOT, ATTRACTS GUYS,
SELLS DRINKS.

36:53.745 --> 36:54.980
- YEAH, WELL,
FUCK THE DRINKS.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.515
IF HE WANTS TO GET
HIS DICK SUCKED,

36:56.548 --> 36:59.585
HE CAN TAKE HIS ACT
TO THE BACKROOM.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.720
- I'LL TELL HIM.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.722
- WAIT.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.391
TELL HIM...

37:05.424 --> 37:07.393
HE'S BARRED
FROM THE CLUB,

37:07.426 --> 37:09.395
PERMANENTLY.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.730
- AW, COME ON, BRIAN...
- DO IT.

37:11.763 --> 37:12.731
NOW!

37:12.764 --> 37:20.672
*

37:53.672 --> 37:55.674
- AND IN A RECENT
HOLLYWOOD MOVIE

37:55.707 --> 37:57.409
ABOUT THE TROJAN WAR,

37:57.443 --> 38:00.979
THERE WAS A SMALL,
BUT VERY SIGNIFICANT, ALTERATION

38:01.012 --> 38:04.850
IN THE LEGEND AS RECOUNTED
BY HOMER IN THE ILIAD.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.052
ACHILLES DIDN'T GO TO WAR

38:07.085 --> 38:10.656
BECAUSE THE GREEKS
KILLED PATROCLUS, HIS COUSIN.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.591
HE WENT TO BATTLE

38:12.624 --> 38:15.527
BECAUSE THEY KILLED
PATROCLUS, HIS LOVER.

38:15.561 --> 38:17.329
- EXCUSE ME,
PROFESSOR,

38:17.363 --> 38:18.464
BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE

38:18.497 --> 38:20.399
IF THEY CHANGED
SOME OLD LEGEND?

38:20.432 --> 38:22.434
LIKE, WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

38:22.468 --> 38:24.936
- BECAUSE THAT "OLD LEGEND"
WAS REWRITTEN

38:24.970 --> 38:27.105
TO OMIT A VERY
IMPORTANT TRUTH:

38:27.138 --> 38:30.108
THAT THE HOMOPHOBIA WHICH
INFECTS OUR CULTURE

38:30.141 --> 38:32.411
DIDN'T ALWAYS EXIST.

38:32.444 --> 38:35.481
THERE WERE ONCE
GREAT AND POWERFUL CULTURES

38:35.514 --> 38:38.684
IN WHICH THE EMOTIONAL
AND SEXUAL LOVE

38:38.717 --> 38:40.886
BETWEEN TWO MEN
WAS ACCEPTED,

38:40.919 --> 38:42.421
EVEN AMONG WARRIORS.

38:42.454 --> 38:45.424
- YEAH, GOOD FOR THEM.
BUT WHAT ABOUT US?

38:45.457 --> 38:47.826
- WHILE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE TROJAN WAR,

38:47.859 --> 38:48.827
THEY'RE TRYING
TO TAKE OUR RIGHTS AWAY.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.562
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN.

38:50.596 --> 38:54.366
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE HERE
TO DISCUSS GAY IMAGERY

38:54.400 --> 38:56.702
IN MYTHOLOGY AND HISTORY.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.837
- IF PROPOSITION 14 PASSES,

38:58.870 --> 39:00.839
PRETTY SOON
WE'LL BE HISTORY.

39:00.872 --> 39:03.442
[murmured agreement]
- HE'S RIGHT.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.976
- WELL, THERE'S A MEETING
AT THE CENTER.

39:05.010 --> 39:05.911
- ARE YOU GOING TO COME?
- YEAH.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.893
- WHAT A DUMP.
- [chuckling]

39:21.927 --> 39:25.764
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
- YOU DO A FABULOUS BETTE DAVIS.

39:25.797 --> 39:26.865
OR IS IT
ELIZABETH TAYLOR

39:26.898 --> 39:28.534
DOING A FABULOUS
BETTE DAVIS?

39:28.567 --> 39:30.001
- I'M NOT DOING
A FABULOUS ANYBODY.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.538
ALL I KNOW IS, THIS
IS A DISGUSTING PLACE

39:32.571 --> 39:33.739
AND YOU'RE NOT
LIVING HERE.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.641
- I LOVE IT.
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

39:35.674 --> 39:37.042
- IF I AM, I HAVE YOU
AND DAD TO THANK.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.411
- IT'S TINY,
IT SMELLS LIKE, UH,

39:39.445 --> 39:42.013
SOMETHING YOU NEVER WANT
TO MEET DIED HERE.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.782
YOU HAVE TO SHARE
A BATHROOM DOWN THE HALL

39:43.815 --> 39:45.183
WITH GOD-KNOWS-WHO.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.653
CRACKHEADS?
NOT TO MENTION,

39:47.686 --> 39:49.521
YOU CAN'T GO OUT INTO
THE STREET AFTER DARK.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.957
- ON THE OTHER HAND,
I CAN AFFORD IT.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.425
IT'S GOT GREAT LIGHT,

39:53.459 --> 39:57.028
AND BEST OF ALL,
IT'S MY OWN PLACE.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.432
- HOW DID I EVER GIVE BIRTH
TO AN ARTIST?

40:00.466 --> 40:03.569
- VAN GOGH'S MOTHER
WAS A WASHERWOMAN.

40:03.602 --> 40:06.104
- REALLY?

40:06.137 --> 40:08.073
- I MADE IT UP.
- IT'S, UM...

40:09.741 --> 40:13.178
QUITE A COME-DOWN
FROM BRIAN'S PLACE.

40:13.211 --> 40:15.781
- YOU WEREN'T SO THRILLED
WHEN I MOVED IN THERE.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.984
- NO. I GUESS NOT.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.720
I JUST WISH THAT YOU...

40:21.753 --> 40:23.955
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ACTUALLY
HEARING MYSELF SAY THIS.

40:23.989 --> 40:27.125
- WHAT?
- THAT YOU AND HE COULD HAVE...

40:27.158 --> 40:28.960
SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO WORK THINGS OUT.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.464
- I KNOW.

40:32.498 --> 40:33.599
ME, TOO.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.067
- I MEAN, IT'S NOT AS IF HE

40:36.101 --> 40:39.971
REPEATEDLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY
LIED TO YOU OR ABUSED YOU

40:40.005 --> 40:41.740
OR BETRAYED YOU,

40:41.773 --> 40:43.108
LIKE YOUR FATHER
DID TO ME.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.076
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.945
HE SAVED MY LIFE.
HE TOOK CARE OF ME.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.581
HE GAVE ME EVERYTHING.

40:49.615 --> 40:52.150
IT'S JUST THAT WE EACH
WANT DIFFERENT THINGS.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.554
- AND NEITHER OF YOU
IS WILLING TO CHANGE?

40:55.587 --> 40:58.490
- THAT'S NOT LOVE,
THAT'S SACRIFICE.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.127
- HMM.

41:04.596 --> 41:08.700
- HE FELL ASLEEP THE SECOND
HIS HEAD HIT THE PILLOW.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.703
- WELL, HE'S GLAD TO BE
BACK IN HIS OWN ROOM,

41:11.737 --> 41:13.805
IN HIS OWN BED.
- I DON'T BLAME HIM.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.579
- I'M TRYING TO CATCH UP
ON THE WORLD.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.881
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN LIVING
ON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PLANET.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.916
- ME TOO.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.719
IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT,
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.656
- THOSE WORDS WILL
NEVER ESCAPE MY LIPS.

41:30.689 --> 41:34.526
- WHY NOT?
YOU WERE RIGHT.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.898
IT'S FUNNY.

41:39.931 --> 41:43.134
NO MATTER WHAT
YOU KNOW UP HERE...

41:43.168 --> 41:46.672
YOU HOPE AGAINST HOPE...

41:46.705 --> 41:49.140
IN HERE...

41:49.174 --> 41:50.742
THAT YOUR PARENTS,
AT LEAST,

41:50.776 --> 41:54.212
WILL LOVE YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.915
- WE'LL TRY AND DO BETTER
WITH OUR KIDS.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.662
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

42:10.696 --> 42:12.097
- TO A HOTEL, I GUESS.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.599
AT LEAST, FOR TONIGHT.

42:17.836 --> 42:19.938
- TAKE YOUR COAT OFF.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.707
- WHAT?
- TAKE YOUR COAT OFF.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.174
YOU'RE STAYING HERE TONIGHT.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.911
- I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

42:25.944 --> 42:28.647
- OH, NEITHER DO I,
BUT YOU'RE STAYING ANYWAY.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.649
- ARE YOU SURE?

42:30.682 --> 42:33.251
- I'LL MAKE US TEA
AND GRILLED CHEESE,

42:33.284 --> 42:35.954
AND WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, OKAY?

42:50.836 --> 42:52.070
- ANOTHER BEER.

42:52.103 --> 42:55.006
- AND ANOTHER COSMO
AND A DIET PEPSI,

42:55.040 --> 42:56.274
ON ME.

42:56.307 --> 42:57.943
- BIG SPENDER.

42:57.976 --> 42:59.277
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

42:59.310 --> 43:01.346
- WE'RE CELEBRATING.

43:01.379 --> 43:05.817
TEDDY FINALLY PUT THAT PRICK,
TROY, IN HIS PROPER PLACE.

43:05.851 --> 43:07.252
- UP A TIGHT BUTTHOLE?

43:07.285 --> 43:09.354
- OUT ON HIS ASS.

43:09.387 --> 43:12.858
HE'S NO LONGER
AUNT PITY FUCK.

43:12.891 --> 43:15.727
- CONGRATULATIONS,
THEODORE.

43:15.761 --> 43:18.263
IT'S A RARE MAN WHO'D RATHER
GET EVEN THAN GET LAID.

43:21.199 --> 43:23.769
- JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
HOW GREAT WAS HE?

43:25.403 --> 43:28.707
- BEYOND GREAT.

43:28.740 --> 43:31.710
AMAZING.

43:31.743 --> 43:33.244
THE BEST.

43:33.278 --> 43:36.648
- YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO STILL HAVE HIS PHONE NUMBER?

43:45.924 --> 43:48.126
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

43:48.159 --> 43:49.427
- YOUR HAND'S
ON MY STICK.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.997
- WHY DID YOU BAR ME
FROM YOUR CLUB?

43:52.030 --> 43:54.800
- BECAUSE I CAN.

43:57.769 --> 43:59.037
GETTING SUCKED OFF
ON THE DANCE FLOOR

43:59.070 --> 44:02.841
IS A VERY
SERIOUS OFFENSE.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.342
- EXCEPT WHEN IT'S YOU.

44:04.375 --> 44:07.312
- MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.752
- I THINK YOU THREW ME OUT

44:13.785 --> 44:15.821
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
I'LL GET THE HOTTEST GUYS.

44:15.854 --> 44:17.022
- I AM THE HOTTEST GUY.

44:17.055 --> 44:18.156
- YOU MEAN "WERE."

44:18.189 --> 44:19.991
- SINCE WHEN?
- SINCE ME.

44:21.860 --> 44:24.029
EVEN THE MIGHTIEST
ONE DAY MUST FALL.

44:24.062 --> 44:26.832
THE KING IS ASSASSINATED,
THE LION IS TORN TO SHREDS.

44:26.865 --> 44:30.668
- OH LORD, PLEASE SPARE US
FROM WEARISOME CLICHES.

44:33.204 --> 44:35.173
LISTEN...

44:35.206 --> 44:36.975
TWERP...

44:37.008 --> 44:38.443
YOU THINK YOU GET
TO BE THE BEST

44:38.476 --> 44:40.812
BY JUST SHOWING UP
AND ANNOUNCING THAT YOU ARE?

44:42.347 --> 44:44.850
YOU HAVE TO
PROVE IT FIRST.

44:44.883 --> 44:47.185
- I THOUGHT I ALREADY HAD.

44:47.218 --> 44:50.021
- BY PICKING OFF A COUPLE
OF TWINKS BEFORE I GOT TO THEM?

44:52.490 --> 44:54.125
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.

44:56.227 --> 44:58.864
- THEN HOW ABOUT WE PICK...

44:58.897 --> 45:00.932
SAY, THE TEN HOTTEST GUYS
WE CAN FIND,

45:00.966 --> 45:02.934
- AND THE ONE WHO FUCKS
THEM ALL FIRST WINS?

45:02.968 --> 45:03.969
- YOU KNOW THE GAME.

45:04.002 --> 45:06.938
- I ALSO KNOW
THE OUTCOME.

45:06.972 --> 45:09.474
- I ADMIRE YOUR CONFIDENCE.

45:09.507 --> 45:11.476
BUT THEY SAY
EVERY STAR BURNS ITS BRIGHTEST

45:11.509 --> 45:16.081
JUST BEFORE IT BURNS OUT.
- OOH.

45:16.114 --> 45:18.349
SAY YOU WIN?

45:18.383 --> 45:19.985
- I GET INTO BABYLON.

45:21.519 --> 45:23.721
AND IF YOU WIN?

45:25.924 --> 45:28.760
- I GET INTO YOU.

45:36.868 --> 45:39.838
[indistinct chatter]

45:39.871 --> 45:42.808
- MICHAEL,
WE SAVED SEATS.

45:45.010 --> 45:47.378
- HEY, HONEY.
WHERE'S BEN?

45:47.412 --> 45:49.881
- UM, HE HAD OTHER
THINGS TO DO.

45:49.915 --> 45:52.017
- WHAT OTHER THING'S MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THIS?

45:52.050 --> 45:54.419
- GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.187
I GUESS WE ALL KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE:

45:56.221 --> 46:01.126
TO JOIN IN THE STATE-WIDE EFFORT
TO DEFEAT PROPOSITION 14.

46:01.159 --> 46:04.095
[cheers and applause]

46:10.035 --> 46:11.269
