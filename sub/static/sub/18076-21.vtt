35:52.493 --> 35:53.525
Who is this?

35:53.620 --> 35:56.158
HANNlBAL: Is this Douggie KyIe?
Crazy oId Douggie?

35:56.497 --> 35:59.285
How is things, aside from being homicidal?

35:59.375 --> 36:00.953
What do you want, Smith?

36:01.044 --> 36:02.835
l thought l'd call and tell you...

36:02.921 --> 36:06.124
you guys looked like
you lost your knitting out there today.

36:06.216 --> 36:08.007
You were supposed to be good.

36:08.092 --> 36:09.919
Yeah, well, it's not over yet.

36:10.011 --> 36:12.549
HANNlBAL: Yeah? We got
a IittIe proposition for you.

36:12.889 --> 36:15.380
How would you like to come over here...

36:15.475 --> 36:18.310
and try us out
when we know you're coming?

36:18.728 --> 36:22.227
KYLE: No deal.
HANNlBAL: Okay. It's up to you.

36:22.565 --> 36:26.563
But in six hours we're out of here,
other side of the world.

36:26.778 --> 36:30.562
Now you and I both know
you can't afford that.

36:31.157 --> 36:33.066
You know where we are.

36:33.534 --> 36:36.286
And bring your own tourniquets.

36:45.630 --> 36:47.872
-We're ready.
-Kyle, this is pointless.

36:47.966 --> 36:51.251
-We're walking right into a trap.
-l make the rules.

36:51.469 --> 36:53.925
We finish this job and we finish it now.

36:54.013 --> 36:56.848
Anybody doesn't want to come aIong,
hangs it right here.

36:56.933 --> 36:58.842
We'll do it Kyle's way.

37:04.857 --> 37:08.558
SHARPHOOK: But if this goes wrong, Kyle,
then there are no rules.

37:08.653 --> 37:10.562
You and l will settle.

I think KyIe knows where I am.

40:46.412 --> 40:49.164
Face, can you read me?
KyIe's got a Iead on me.

40:56.839 --> 40:59.710

44:41.231 --> 44:45.098
All right. What did you do with Mrs. Harper
and Harper's kid?

44:45.777 --> 44:48.149
They are in an equipment shed.

44:48.905 --> 44:50.648
At Harper's place.

44:51.032 --> 44:53.986
Great idea. How did you ever think of that?

44:55.536 --> 44:59.071
Next time you think
you wanna take somebody out, pal...

44:59.582 --> 45:01.824
don't just get yourself a good squad...

45:01.918 --> 45:03.745
get yourself a team.

45:12.053 --> 45:15.469
l can't thank you people enough
for saving my wife and child.

45:15.557 --> 45:18.926
-Mr. Harper, it was a pleasure.
-Except for my stomach aches.

45:19.018 --> 45:21.889
What's a little typhoon in your mainspring...

45:21.980 --> 45:25.929
when you get a chance to put away a clod
like Kyle and his buddies forever?

45:26.025 --> 45:27.982
lt's weird. The guy gets sick as sin...

45:28.069 --> 45:31.070
and he still puts away that stuff
like a calico in July.

45:31.155 --> 45:34.774
lt is called concentration, amigo.

45:35.159 --> 45:37.733
Some men walk on hot coals,
some eat glass...

45:37.829 --> 45:41.328
some climb Mount Everest,
others drink milk.

45:41.416 --> 45:44.452
lt is the way of the universe.

45:44.752 --> 45:46.875
That's very deep, Murdock.

45:47.755 --> 45:51.124
Did we ever find out why those men
went after you guys, Hannibal?

45:51.217 --> 45:52.296
Yes.

45:52.552 --> 45:54.924
A big foreign syndicate wanted revenge...

45:55.013 --> 45:57.301
because we messed up
too many of their plans.

45:57.390 --> 45:59.015
-Don't you love it?
-No.

45:59.100 --> 46:01.176
l'm just glad you all survived.

46:01.269 --> 46:05.267
Speaking of survival, how many days
of training we got left, guys?

46:05.398 --> 46:08.233
As many as it takes, buster, if you're a man.

46:08.318 --> 46:10.606
l bet you're gonna be
a good Samaritan, right?

46:10.695 --> 46:13.020
Give us the next five days off
on account of...

46:13.114 --> 46:16.281
we've made up for them
with this real experience.

46:16.409 --> 46:18.567
You're close. Ladies.

46:26.127 --> 46:28.914
l'm gonna let you guys run back to the base.

46:29.005 --> 46:31.294
B.A.: Hannibal, l got a belly full of milk, man!

46:31.382 --> 46:34.716
Now that's not funny, Hannibal.
Let us in the van.

46:35.011 --> 46:37.798
As they say in Fairbanks, ''Mush!''

46:38.223 --> 46:40.464
