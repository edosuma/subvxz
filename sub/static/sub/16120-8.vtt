Violet:
Come on, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.288
Nova, you should be driving
to St. Jo's right now.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.308
You know how these storms
shift every which way.

00:09.340 --> 00:13.504
So, whatever you're doing,
stop and get your behind here.

00:13.540 --> 00:15.633
Okay?

00:15.680 --> 00:17.477
All right.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.243
Newscaster over TV:
The National Hurricane Center

00:21.280 --> 00:22.747
has issued a tropical
storm warning

00:22.790 --> 00:25.213
for southern Louisiana
and coastal MISSISSIppI.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.481
And a direct strike
of Tropical Storm Peter
is expected.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.181
Well, this sucks.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.583
Last week's interview
sealed the deal.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.621
Today was just
a meet and greet.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.525
Relax, honey.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.290
Y'all ain't still planning
to go to that school?

00:38.330 --> 00:40.389
Doubt it.
Not in this weather.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.759
When are we going
to reschedule the tour then?

00:41.800 --> 00:44.530
A tour of what?
That place ain't college.

00:44.570 --> 00:48.677
Gardini Prep is NOLA's
top private school, Aunt Vi.

00:48.710 --> 00:52.111
Did y'all think about going
to St. Jo's high school?

00:52.150 --> 00:54.641
Newscaster:
Now, as you know, our last
big storm on record...

00:54.680 --> 00:55.817
( scoffs )

00:55.850 --> 00:59.217
Well, schools don't turn
their nose up at St. Jo's.

00:59.260 --> 01:03.151
LSU, Ole Miss...

01:03.190 --> 01:05.124
Texas Tech.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.559
And the list goes on.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.591
I think Micah's looking
more to, you know,

01:08.630 --> 01:11.098
Harvard, Stanford, MIT.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.631
The other Ivies.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.462
Yeah.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.764
They're closed
due to inclement weather.

01:17.810 --> 01:21.302
Well, good.
Micah, you can go take
them fancy clothes off

01:21.340 --> 01:22.841
and grab all the blankets,

01:22.880 --> 01:25.371
coats and towels
out that closet.

01:25.410 --> 01:26.809
Is it going to get
that bad?

01:26.850 --> 01:28.477
Well, we're going to
treat it like a snow day.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.283
Make some fun out of it.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.311
I got to go.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.487
- Wait, you're leaving?
- Where are you going?

01:34.520 --> 01:36.283
I got to go check
on the farm.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.651
You tell Ralph Angel
I said to bring that boy
over here.

01:38.690 --> 01:41.124
Everybody knows this is
the family safe house.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.388
Hollywood's there.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.489
What do I tell him?

01:45.770 --> 01:48.295
Iwmmmy
He's grown.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.762
He can take care
of himself.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.677
And whoever else he's got
over there taking care of.

01:54.410 --> 01:55.877
Newscaster over TV:
Take this seriously.

01:55.910 --> 01:58.299
This is a major event.
This is Tropical Storm Peter...

02:01.220 --> 02:02.619

02:04.690 --> 02:06.385

02:20.400 --> 02:23.733
* Keep the colors

* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

02:27.880 --> 02:29.541
Newscaster over radio:
The heavy rain expected

02:29.580 --> 02:31.798
from Tropical Storm Peter
may potentially

02:31.850 --> 02:33.818
put mild pressure on the levees
here in New Orleans.

02:33.850 --> 02:36.239
Though the rain has yet
to begin to fall,

02:36.290 --> 02:37.541
- expect some light sprinkles--
- Miss Blanche,

02:37.590 --> 02:38.739
don't your niece
need a ride?

02:38.790 --> 02:41.281
Holy Cross will be
on the evac list

02:41.320 --> 02:42.685
if they have to put one out.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.255
_Her boss don't care
If a hurricane coming

02:45.290 --> 02:46.791
or the end of the world.

02:46.830 --> 02:48.821
They already said they're going
to fire that girl

02:48.860 --> 02:51.328
if she don't come in
In the morning.

02:51.370 --> 02:52.928
Newscaster:
There Is_a concern
at this hour

02:52.970 --> 02:54.562
that Tropical Storm Peter
could shift course,

02:54.600 --> 02:55.828
possibly making
landfall tonight,

02:55.870 --> 02:58.964
posing the most acute threat
from a tropical system

02:59.010 --> 03:00.807
since Hurricane Sandy.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.547
All indications have Peter
reaching New Orleans...

03:03.580 --> 03:06.469
The Ninth is not ready
for another hurricane.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.272
It's barely ready
for a sunny day.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.379
( cell phone rings )

03:10.420 --> 03:11.614
Aunt Vi?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.584
I'll call her back.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.758
Your niece will be okay,
Miss Blanche.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.754
The Lord willing
and the creek don't rise.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.688
Newscaster:
...as to the length
and duration of Peter.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.561
We're hoping it stops
during the night,

03:25.600 --> 03:27.636
but very possible
that it continues on

03:27.670 --> 03:29.809
for a day or two after.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.832
( radio static crackles )

03:32.880 --> 03:36.543
How the hell we supposed
to ride out a hurricane here?

03:36.580 --> 03:38.445
You ain't got nothing.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.448
Ain't no hurricane yet.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.710
But we got food.

03:42.750 --> 03:46.311
What, stale-ass cereal
and three-day-old milk?

03:49.630 --> 03:52.724
Flashlights. Batteries.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.523
Look, I got what Pop had,
all right?

03:54.560 --> 03:55.925
That means you ain't
got nothing.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.292
Hell, I see why you was
always at Vi's house.

03:58.330 --> 03:59.695
- Hey.
- Hey!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.469

Hey, what's up, sis?

04:02.670 --> 04:04.035
Look who it is!

04:04.070 --> 04:05.367
Mwah!

04:05.410 --> 04:06.536
- Hi, baby.
- Got to go.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.935
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.471
- Prosper still out there?
- No, he headed home.

04:11.510 --> 04:12.716
Remy out there, though.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.911
What about the workers?
Are they still here?

04:14.950 --> 04:18.283
Yeah, but they need to get paid
before they leave.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.413
- You bring cash?
- Yeah.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.621
Is the rest
of the cane in?

04:22.660 --> 04:24.059
Ralph Angel:
Only 10 acres left to go.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.593
Good. They need to finish,
because if it floods--

04:26.630 --> 04:28.598
Oh, it's going to flood.

04:28.630 --> 04:31.019
The only question is,
how much?

04:31.070 --> 04:33.061
Wood, Ralph Angel,

04:33.100 --> 04:34.965
can we pay these guys
so they can take off?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.308
Yeah.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.035
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.704
( thunder rumbles )

04:41.740 --> 04:43.503
Charley:
So they're done planting?

04:43.550 --> 04:45.404
No. Prosper said
to let them leave.

04:45.450 --> 04:48.749
No, we need to finish
this now. That's the point
of all of this.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.748
( speaks Spanish )

04:50.790 --> 04:52.758
( speaking Spanish )

04:58.660 --> 05:00.059
( workers murmuring )

05:00.100 --> 05:02.591
Charley, pay them
and let them leave.

05:02.630 --> 05:06.498
Yeah, their bus pickup
way over near Jones' farm.
That's 40 minutes from here.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.792
No, but the weather report
says that it's just
a tropical storm.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.502
The weather changes
quick here. They stay
an hour away.

05:11.540 --> 05:13.770
You want to risk them
mIssmg the bus and being
stuck here?

05:13.810 --> 05:15.675
They can finish the planting
and still make the bus.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.803
( speaks Spanish )

05:18.950 --> 05:22.340
Uh, after--
( speaks Spanish )

05:22.390 --> 05:23.482
Okay?

05:23.520 --> 05:25.442
Gracias.

- A hurricane?

06:13.900 --> 06:14.992
- Damn.
- Only a matter of time

06:15.040 --> 06:17.702
that we were officially
given the upgrade

06:17.740 --> 06:19.469
to a category 1 hurricane,

06:19.510 --> 06:22.604
with winds now reaching
around 70 miles per hour.

Experts expect this...

06:23.910 --> 06:25.969
You want to stay
at my place?

06:27.850 --> 06:29.738
It's a little soon
for that, ain't it?

06:29.790 --> 06:33.453
I meant for safety, Nova.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.185
Sorry about that.
I'm just not a...

Newscaster:
...80% of New Orleans_was
submerged at one pomt,

07:20.540 --> 07:23.202
The water reached
six to 12 miles inland...

07:23.240 --> 07:26.061
Now this here, this is what
I'm talking about.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.999
This will get me
through any storm.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.770
- Okay! Yes, indeed.

You be safe now.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.185

07:41.290 --> 07:43.224
Newscaster:
...very unlikely
that Peter will be

07:43.260 --> 07:46.627
even remotely as destructive
as some of his predecessors,

07:46.660 --> 07:48.821
the danger is real...

You scared me half to death.

Are you on the 10
headed this way?

07:56.970 --> 07:58.699
No, not yet.
I'll be leaving soon.

07:58.740 --> 08:00.571
Why haven't you left yet?

08:00.610 --> 08:03.044
I had to help out
a few folks in the Ninth.
You know how it is.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.605
I know how it was
last time.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.811
Stop worrying, Aunt Vi.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.613
Well, I'm going to worry,

08:09.650 --> 08:11.242
because you gave me cause to.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.612
You hacking your way
out that roof, up there
nearly a day.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.480
We could have lost you.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.726
But y'all didn't.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.092
I have a responsibility
to my neighbors,

08:22.130 --> 08:24.291
especially when
they can't help themselves.

08:24.330 --> 08:27.993
Yeah, well,
that's all and good,
but now this a hurricane,

08:28.040 --> 08:30.907
so you get yourself
on the 10 before
Pontchartrain flood.

08:30.940 --> 08:33.602
Please. And call me
when you do.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.011
Don't be scratching up
my truck.

What you doing here,
Darla?

09:12.950 --> 09:14.542
I wanted to give Blue
his birthday gift.

09:18.350 --> 09:22.980
A hurricane coming,
and here you go being you,
huh?

09:23.030 --> 09:25.783
You're too late.
You can't even get
his birthday right.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.650
I didn't have the money
last month.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.066
- Can I give it to him?
- No.

09:32.100 --> 09:35.035
You can't just come in
and see him whenever
you want.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.038
That ain't how this work.

09:37.070 --> 09:38.765
Look, go home, Darla.

09:38.810 --> 09:41.370
You ain't got no business
being out in this weather
no way.

09:41.410 --> 09:42.672
All right?

09:42.710 --> 09:45.941
They evacuated
my trailer park.

09:45.980 --> 09:49.279
I just stopped by
on the way to the shelter.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.084

09:52.120 --> 09:55.886
You ain't got no new friends

Mommy!

Oh, my goodness,

Who else
would it be for?

10:10.670 --> 10:12.103
- Checkers?
- Mm-hmm.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.676
Blue:
Can we play?

10:13.710 --> 10:15.905

- Blue: Okay.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.805

Don't push it.

Go Fish first?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.785

Ooh, that sounds good.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.708
Ain't no time for games now,
all right?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.978
All the roads around St. Jo's
done closed up.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.749
Hurricane done shifted.

10:30.790 --> 10:32.621
Upgraded to a category 2.

10:47.240 --> 10:47.729
I'm worried about him.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.305
Violet, too.

10:52.350 --> 10:53.977
If two people
want to get together,

10:54.020 --> 10:56.011
can't nothing
hold that back.

10:56.050 --> 10:58.109
Not even themselves.

11:00.890 --> 11:03.222
You don't need to waste time
over here helping us out

11:03.260 --> 11:06.058
when you got a house
of your own to take care of.

11:06.090 --> 11:09.025
Lady, I felt this storm
coming a week ago.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.858
My place is ready
for whatever may come,

11:11.900 --> 11:13.959
hell or high water.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.297
You a psychic?

11:15.340 --> 11:17.433
Just a man with a bum knee.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.802
( both laugh )

11:20.910 --> 11:22.138
Uh-uh-uh.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.307
About to get splinters
all in your hands.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.772
Let it go. Here.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.859
Just put it there.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.907
Aunt Vi's the only place
to hole up, Darla.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.066
Ralph Angel:
Ain't no backup.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.931
Come on.
Come on, boy.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.744
The storm might not
be that bad.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.179
Hop in the truck, Blue.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.246
Violet probably won't
have the room for all of us.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.942
What you gonna do,
Darla?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.844
We ain't got all day.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.118
Come on.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.322
I'll put all of them
back there.

12:14.260 --> 12:15.955
- I got yours.
- Thank you.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.365
You got it.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.033
Y'all finish up
that last window.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.367
I'm going to meet
y'all at Vi's.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.502
Yeah.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.844
( starts engine )

12:34.880 --> 12:36.245
See y'all later.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.986
- Hey, be careful.
- Holleood: You too, now.

12:38.020 --> 12:41.114
I'm going to bring them in,
release them,

12:41.160 --> 12:43.287
and then I'll bring in
the combine from the fields.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.957
( car engine starts )

12:44.990 --> 12:46.924
But they haven't
finished it yet.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.848
You want them
to get stuck out there?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.322
I'll do it.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.533
( newscaster speaking
over TV)

13:02.580 --> 13:05.299
Okay, baby, put that water
in the refrigerator

13:05.350 --> 13:08.012
and crank it on high
so that the food won't spoil

13:08.050 --> 13:09.449
if the electricity goes out.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.380
And then go out
into the shed

13:11.420 --> 13:13.809
and round up
batteries and lanterns.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.259
They should be
over the dryer.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.554
( thunder rumbles )

13:21.060 --> 13:22.357
Are you okay?

13:22.400 --> 13:25.528
I will be as soon as
Nova answers her phone.

13:25.570 --> 13:29.290
She's dodging calls like
I'm a damn bill collector.

13:29.340 --> 13:32.161
Nova,
an hour done passed
and gone,

13:32.210 --> 13:33.575
and you're still
not here.

13:33.610 --> 13:36.875
Get here before this storm
blows you away!

13:36.910 --> 13:38.468
( phone beeps off)

13:40.220 --> 13:41.812
( drill whirring )

13:48.290 --> 13:49.484
What do you think
you're doing?

13:49.520 --> 13:51.624
Saving you from getting
some new windows.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.299
This thing up here
all crooked and whatnot.

13:54.330 --> 13:56.548
You should be concerned
with boarding up windows

13:56.600 --> 13:58.898
where you live.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.568
That ain't here.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.208
(drill whirs)

14:07.110 --> 14:08.202
All right.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.468
Violet:
Is that my Blue?

14:09.510 --> 14:10.841
Blue:
Yup!

14:15.220 --> 14:17.939
Darla: _
How are you d0ing,
Miss Violet?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.880
Mom surprised me, Aunt Vi.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.081
You and me both, baby.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.483
Mwah!

14:29.560 --> 14:31.198
- You want to show me your room?
- Yeah!

14:31.230 --> 14:32.424
Come on, come on!

14:40.940 --> 14:45.400
Tell me, what the hell
is that girl doing here?

14:45.450 --> 14:47.918
She just showed up.
I ain't ask her.

14:47.950 --> 14:51.215
But Blue got all happy
about her being here.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.059
What you want me to do?

14:53.090 --> 14:56.514
Bad enough that Hollywood
done made his way
into my house,

14:56.560 --> 14:57.925
but Darla?

14:57.960 --> 15:00.326
Oh, unh-uh.
She got to go.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.351
What, you want me
to kick her out?

15:02.400 --> 15:04.618
Damn right, that's exactly
what I want you to do.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.467
In front of Blue?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.139
You ain't even thinking
how this is going to
mess with his head.

15:09.170 --> 15:12.606
That girl being here
is already messing
with his head.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.575
She treat being a mama
like a damn revolving door.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.475
So you right.
I ain't got no problem

15:17.510 --> 15:20.047
with revolving her ass
right on out of here.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.142
Holy...

15:26.190 --> 15:28.158
( rain patters,
thunder rumbles )

15:28.190 --> 15:30.158
( both sigh )

15:30.190 --> 15:32.920
( laughs )

15:39.730 --> 15:42.039
Hollywood:
I'm going to head out
and go to the store.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.538
- Charley: Be careful.
- Mm-hmm, y'all, too.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.628
Whoo!

15:54.720 --> 15:56.039
I'm going to...

17:08.690 --> 17:10.521
Newscaster over TV:
Watching this storm as it

17:10.560 --> 17:12.619
gains in strength and intensity
out there over the gulf.

17:12.660 --> 17:15.549
These warm gulf waters
making this an extremely
unstable...

17:15.600 --> 17:18.091
I hope you know
you're not leaving
this house.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.135
You kidnapping me?

17:22.170 --> 17:25.833
If it keeps you from getting
into a wreck, then yes.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.406
( laughs )

17:27.440 --> 17:29.305
I'm not the hardheaded one.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.149
That's your M.O.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.442
I'm certain.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.277
- Ah.
- Not hardheaded.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.617
There's a big difference.

17:35.650 --> 17:38.778
- Oh, is there? Okay.
- There is, actually.

17:38.820 --> 17:41.380
Hurricane Peter
has been upgraded

17:41.420 --> 17:43.456
to a category 3
hurricane, folks.

17:43.490 --> 17:46.425
Yup, looks like
you're staying here tonight.

17:46.460 --> 17:49.395
Mm-hmm_. And _it's not even
up for discu55ion, Remy,

17:49.430 --> 17:50.658
so don't try it.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.836
Final word.

17:57.670 --> 17:59.433
Nova won't answer
her phone,

17:59.470 --> 18:01.609
and she was supposed to
be here two hours ago.

18:04.180 --> 18:05.602
( door closes )

18:05.650 --> 18:07.208
Hey.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.445
How y'all doing?

18:09.480 --> 18:11.243
You can't pick up a phone?

18:11.290 --> 18:13.178
Making Aunt Vi
worry like that.

18:13.220 --> 18:15.859
You ain't worried about me.
So just don't get in it
at all.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.448
Violet:
Oh, I'm going to get in it.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.879
You drove my blood pressure up
waiting on you.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.490
I'm sorry.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.195
( sighs )

18:25.230 --> 18:28.461
Newscaster over _TV:
You can expect Winds in excess
of 110 miles per hour...

18:28.500 --> 18:30.161
Remy:
Wet enough for you?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.201
Let's just say a sister's
happy to have locks.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.470
You know water's
the black woman's
kryptonite.

18:34.510 --> 18:36.432
What's the weather like
in NOLA?

18:36.480 --> 18:38.641
The Ninth already got
four inches,

18:38.680 --> 18:40.875
but my place
is ready for it.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.718
If you left the Ninth
and moved to the Quarter...

18:43.750 --> 18:46.787
I rebuilt in the Ninth
before, and I'll do it
again if need be.

18:46.820 --> 18:48.583
Everybody doesn't run
from home and family

18:48.620 --> 18:50.383
just because
shit gets tough.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.250
( newscaster
continuing over TV )

18:57.400 --> 18:58.697
Hey.

18:58.730 --> 19:00.288
Hey.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.365
Hey, Nova.
How've you been?

19:02.400 --> 19:04.265
Hey!

19:04.310 --> 19:07.234
( laughs )

19:07.280 --> 19:09.202
Whoo!
( chuckles )

19:09.240 --> 19:11.572
Nova:
I don't know why
you try to fight it.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.714
You swear your but
half mermaid.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.617
Come on now, Holleood.
Only a fifth?

19:16.650 --> 19:19.710
We going to be in here
all night, child. Ah.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.581
-(laughs)
- Got something
for you, though.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.781
- Nova: Oh!
- ( Holleood grunts )

19:23.830 --> 19:25.786
So, you intend on getting
that ass whupped tonight?

19:25.830 --> 19:28.253
What? You don't even know
how to Sit at no spades table.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.927
My partner take all your books,
you going to act like

19:29.960 --> 19:31.666
you don't even know
how to play the game, girl.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.258
- Nova: Okay.
- Ain't that right, partner?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.796
( laughs )
It's like that?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.831
Yeah, we going
to see tonight.

19:38.870 --> 19:41.407
Be right back.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.408
How'd you like Gardini Prep?

19:43.450 --> 19:44.872
Oh, it got canceled.

19:44.910 --> 19:47.743
Nova:
Everything shuts down
around here.

19:47.780 --> 19:50.749
Mardi Gras, Super Bowl, rain.
Don't matter.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.985
How'd you know
we were going to visit?

19:53.020 --> 19:54.385
I texted her.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.785
I think you're going
to like it there.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.959
That campus is nice. Plush.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.493
I just hope the students
are hella cool.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.521
I just hope the academics
are hella cool.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.221
Nova:
Well, when you get in,

20:04.270 --> 20:07.535
which I'm absolutely
sure you will, because
you're brilliant,

20:07.570 --> 20:09.265
you can stay with me
during the week if you want.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.767
Wait, for real?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.630
Nova:
Ain't nobody got time
to be driving back and forth

20:12.670 --> 20:13.876
from St. Jo every day.

20:13.910 --> 20:16.538
And you know
we'd have some fun.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.445
- ( both laugh )
- You have your own life, Nova.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.902
You don't need
to be inconvenienced.

20:19.950 --> 20:22.874
How's my nephew
an inconvenience?

20:22.920 --> 20:26.447
Taking care of a teenager
is a lot of responsibility.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.014
I don't need
taking care of.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.379
It's a new city for him--

20:29.420 --> 20:30.853
A city I can show him around.

20:30.890 --> 20:32.585
Micah doesn't need to be
walking around New Orleans--

20:32.630 --> 20:34.222
The spades table is ready.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.619
Now, who want to get
their ass spanked?

20:50.650 --> 20:52.800
Hollywood:
Oh, hell, no.

20:52.850 --> 20:54.408
- No, no, no, no.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

20:54.450 --> 20:56.008
- What?
- Uh-uh, you are not using

20:56.050 --> 20:58.610
your cheating ways
to bring the spades your way.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.459
I heal, not steal.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.481
Yeah, well, your behind's
going to need a healing

21:02.520 --> 21:03.680
when I steal your books.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.619
Charley, you are
Nova's partner.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.821
No, no. Rah's my partner.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.566
Why my partner
getting stole?

21:10.600 --> 21:11.862
You cheat.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.868
Y'all be using signals,
underbidding,

21:13.900 --> 21:16.630
- talking across the board.
- I bid my books, bro. Come on.

21:16.670 --> 21:17.739
Get up, man.

21:17.770 --> 21:19.499
Come on.
Rise and fly, my love.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.303
Rise and fly.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.672
Man.

21:23.710 --> 21:26.076
Man, I'll play.
Just teach me.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.771
( all chatter)

21:27.820 --> 21:29.572
This is what you
can do right here.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.712
Baby!

21:30.750 --> 21:32.741
We love you,
but you got to go.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.417
Chuck E. Cheese
is that way,
young fella.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.018
Keep the score.
Remy, keep him honest.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.551
There's grown folks
at this table.

21:38.590 --> 21:39.784
Whoo-whee!

21:39.830 --> 21:41.354
That's what
I'm talking about

21:41.400 --> 21:42.958
Hollywood:
Big joker's the big joker.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.798
Little joker's guarantee.
First hand bid--

21:45.830 --> 21:47.366
_House_rules.
I'm just trying to say.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.867
We don't need to announce
the house rules.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.801
"'That dog is crazy,‘
Emily said.

21:51.840 --> 21:55.378
'Crazy happy,‘ I answered.
'Just like me."'

21:55.410 --> 21:56.934
The end.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.538
Read another
story, please.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.673
I'm all out of books, baby.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.540
Ask Pop for another one.

22:02.580 --> 22:06.687
I can tell you one
I heard a long time ago.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.017
- Want to hear it?
- Yup.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.927
Okay, so there were
two best friends

22:10.960 --> 22:12.780
who used to play together.

22:12.830 --> 22:15.355
A girl named Olivia
and a boy named Oscar.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.868
Olivia never had toys,

22:17.900 --> 22:20.368
but Oscar would always
make sure that both of them

22:20.400 --> 22:22.459
had something to play with.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.001
Why didn't Olivia
have toys?

22:24.040 --> 22:27.100
Olivia's parents didn't
have a lot of money.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.801
Like me and Pop?

22:28.840 --> 22:32.549
No. You got a great daddy.

22:32.580 --> 22:34.878
Olivia didn't
have one like yours.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.946
Her pop wasn't around
to give her gifts like that.

22:37.990 --> 22:41.915
So, one day,
Oscar and Olivia were
playing in the woods,

22:41.960 --> 22:44.952
and came across
this beautiful toy.

22:44.990 --> 22:48.118
It would giggle,
play, tell jokes.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.867
They'd never seen
anything like it before,

22:50.900 --> 22:54.836
because it was a special toy,
magically made just for them.

22:54.870 --> 22:59.034
Oscar and Olivia
both fell in love with it.

22:59.070 --> 23:00.731
At first sight.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.704
They played together
with the toy every day.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.173
But then Oscar had to go
on a long vacation,

23:06.210 --> 23:08.075
leaving Olivia all alone.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.145
She'd write to Oscar
every day, telling him
all about

23:10.180 --> 23:12.717
her adventures with
their favorite toy,

23:12.750 --> 23:15.617
but she didn't know
when he'd return.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.924
She so was sad.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.959
One day,
Olivia made other friends.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.865
But they weren't
nice friends.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.162
Were they mean to her?

23:27.200 --> 23:32.069
Yeah, but Olivia
was really mean to herself,

23:32.110 --> 23:36.399
and she didn't take care
of her and Oscar's
magical toy...

23:38.510 --> 23:40.842
which made Oscar very angry.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.041
And when he finally
came back from vacation,

23:43.080 --> 23:46.083
he had to take the magical toy
away from Olivia,

23:46.120 --> 23:50.955
because he could give the toy
all the love Olivia wasn't.

23:50.990 --> 23:53.652
See, he loved and missed
the toy too.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.123
So, Oscar thought
the toy was his,

23:56.160 --> 23:58.993
and Olivia thought
the toy was hers.

23:59.030 --> 24:02.067
But they forgot that
they were best friends.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.806
They thought that they were
on different teams,

24:03.840 --> 24:05.808
when they really were always
on the same side.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.740
Yeah.

24:13.780 --> 24:16.544
It took a while,
but they did.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.580
( giggles )

24:29.200 --> 24:31.464
( rain pattering )

24:40.010 --> 24:41.602
( Hollywood grumbling )

24:41.640 --> 24:42.709
Nova:
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.799
You reneging, Hollywood.

24:44.850 --> 24:45.976
The hell you say?

24:46.010 --> 24:47.238
You drop a club
when spades hit.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.147
You think I reneged,
point the book out.

24:50.180 --> 24:52.239
Why don't you use your
little stone to find it.

24:52.290 --> 24:55.509
You a liar, and the truth
ain't in you.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.858
( all laugh )

25:00.090 --> 25:02.126
You can't say it like Daddy,
Nova, so don't even try.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.252
Sorry, Daddy.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.598
That cigar hanging out
the side his mouth--

25:05.630 --> 25:07.791
You're dropping ashes
everywhere. About to burn
the house down.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.728
Violet:
That's when you knew
you were in trouble.

25:09.770 --> 25:11.533
Then he'd slap that card
on his forehead

25:11.570 --> 25:13.106
just waiting to set you.

25:13.140 --> 25:16.132
He would slam that card
down on the table and holler--

25:16.180 --> 25:16.874
All:
Bam!

25:16.910 --> 25:18.798
Wasn't no winning after that.

25:18.850 --> 25:19.942
( all laugh )

25:19.980 --> 25:22.676
Oh, that man could play,
I tell you.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.256
Micah, what's the score?

25:29.290 --> 25:32.157
Uh, 762...

25:32.190 --> 25:34.055
- ...to 690.
- We was only going to 500.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.625
We could have done won.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.321
How are you gonna play me
and your mama like that?

25:38.370 --> 25:40.224
Charley:
Remy, you were supposed
to be watching him.

25:40.270 --> 25:41.931
Listen, listen, listen,
when you come and stay
with me,

25:41.970 --> 25:43.289
I'm going to teach you.

25:43.340 --> 25:45.137
I'll tell you all
the little secrets, too.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.967
Micah hasn't been
accepted yet, so...

25:47.010 --> 25:48.898
He's a shoe-in.
Just watch.

25:48.940 --> 25:50.771
Yeah, he might be.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.107
What? You don't think
I can get in?

25:52.150 --> 25:55.210
No, baby, your application
is impeccable.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.138
They would be stupid
not to have you.

25:58.650 --> 26:00.311
They'd be downright dumb!

26:00.350 --> 26:02.557
( all laugh )

26:04.290 --> 26:06.622
You know, it's just that
Nova's not up to keeping Micah

26:06.660 --> 26:07.957
five days a week anyway.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.319
I know what I can handle,
Charley.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.292
Micah's no problem.

26:10.330 --> 26:13.299
Well, he's not ready
to stay with you yet.

26:13.330 --> 26:14.661
And why is that?

26:15.970 --> 26:17.062
( sighs )

26:17.100 --> 26:18.931
Your lifestyle, it's--

26:18.970 --> 26:21.109
It's not ideal
for someone like Micah.

26:21.140 --> 26:23.335
Lifestyle?
What is that even
supposed to mean?

26:24.910 --> 26:27.344
Nothing.
Want to play my hand?

26:32.920 --> 26:34.751
Nova:
You know what?

26:34.790 --> 26:37.350
You ain't said nothing
but bullshit

26:37.390 --> 26:38.857
up until now.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.221
So, what do you mean?

26:40.260 --> 26:42.649
Violet:
Y'all are going
to wake up Blue.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.726
If there's something
I want to say, Nova,
I'm going to say it.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.123
No, let her talk, Aunt Vi.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.764
Charley's been having sugar
poured on top of shit

26:49.800 --> 26:50.835
all her life.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.360
My life?

26:52.410 --> 26:55.334
My life is anything
but sugarcoated.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.974
I lost my husband.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.898
I lost my life.
Micah lost his life.

26:59.950 --> 27:02.373
Mi_cah could build a new life
if you weren't so damn
overprotective.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.184
And if you think my lifestyle
of sleeping with a woman

27:05.220 --> 27:08.109
is going to corrupt Micah,
you just hateful.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.116
I couldn't care less
about you sleeping
with a woman.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.354
Well, if that ain't it,

27:11.390 --> 27:13.324
then what lifestyle
you talking about?

27:15.200 --> 27:18.226
You're not a mother.
You grow weed.

27:18.270 --> 27:22.297
And you smoked that weed
with me. Now what?

27:23.440 --> 27:25.260
( sighs )

27:25.310 --> 27:27.266
I'm waiting.

27:27.310 --> 27:30.074
If it's for an apology,
you're going to be waiting
a long time.

27:30.110 --> 27:31.805
I don't want
a damn apology!

27:31.850 --> 27:33.442
I want you to be a grown woman
and come the hell out with it!

27:33.480 --> 27:36.176
You live in the Lower Ninth!

27:36.220 --> 27:38.211
I'm not going to put my son
in a position to be killed,

27:38.250 --> 27:40.787
shot, or in need
of a $10,000 bailout.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.310
Oh, here we go.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.328
No, no. You wanted me
to go there, so I'm there.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.727
Your ego is so big
you can't even apologize

27:47.760 --> 27:49.022
without making excuses.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.425
You were wrong!
You took the money!

27:50.460 --> 27:53.190
But no, no, no,
you can't say it.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.198
Nova:
Why say sorry for
something that I did

27:55.240 --> 27:57.094
- that was right?
- Charley: Oh, my God!

27:57.140 --> 27:58.266
It was for a greater good.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.107
What about my damn
greater good?

28:00.140 --> 28:02.028
You know what? You...

28:03.440 --> 28:04.771
You a bougie bitch.

28:06.980 --> 28:09.448
You know that, right?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.442
I may be bougie,

28:13.490 --> 28:17.119
but at least I'm not having
an affair with a married man.

28:19.330 --> 28:22.049
I actually value marriage,

28:22.100 --> 28:23.863
even if no one else
in my life does.

28:23.900 --> 28:26.960
And I'm not gonna have
my son be stuck again
in a house

28:27.000 --> 28:29.059
where people who claim
to love one another

28:29.100 --> 28:31.409
disrespect each other
and break their promises.

28:31.440 --> 28:35.308
You want to live foul?
Okay, you do you.

28:51.230 --> 28:51.958
- ( thunder crashes )
- Pop!

28:56.530 --> 28:58.998
It's okay, Blue.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.066
I got this.
You can leave.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.830
No, Mommy, stay.

29:03.870 --> 29:05.235
It's all right, buddy.

29:05.270 --> 29:08.239
Let's count the seconds
until the thunder, okay?

29:08.280 --> 29:12.102
That's how we know
how close the storm is.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.311
Pop, will you get
in the bed?

29:16.020 --> 29:18.284
I don't know
ifI could fit, buddy.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.988
But I'll tell you what.

29:22.020 --> 29:24.056
Scoot over and I'll try.

29:24.090 --> 29:25.387
Okay.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.852
All right.

29:44.110 --> 29:47.477
You messing around
with somebody else's husband?

29:53.590 --> 29:55.148
And you're doing this

29:55.190 --> 29:59.229
with all that your
baby sister's been through?

30:00.860 --> 30:03.420
We're not together anymore,

30:03.460 --> 30:04.961
SO...

30:07.230 --> 30:08.936
this ain't the same.

30:12.370 --> 30:15.032
It ain't the same as...

30:15.080 --> 30:17.878
looking at your own mother,

30:17.910 --> 30:22.040
and everything
she went through
with Ernest...

30:22.080 --> 30:24.287
and Charley's mama?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.459
Or don't you remember
any of that?

30:29.490 --> 30:31.924
I haven't forgotten
anything.

30:42.570 --> 30:44.299
( sighs )

31:03.590 --> 31:05.524
Yeah, I miss him, too.

31:09.160 --> 31:13.062
If Ernest knew the mess

31:13.100 --> 31:16.331
you pulled with your wife,

31:18.010 --> 31:21.878
he would've run you
out of town like he did
Jimmy Dale.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.968
Vi, I know you mad at me.

31:28.680 --> 31:32.343
But how do you fix your lips
to compare me to Jimmy Dale?

31:33.490 --> 31:36.152
That man wasn't no man.
He was a coward.

31:36.190 --> 31:39.159
I would never
put my hands on you.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.624
How could you say
something like that?

31:41.660 --> 31:43.491
No, you never hit me.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.892
But you sure knocked
the hell out of me.

31:52.170 --> 31:54.377
Every word you said
was a lie.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.674
I ain't never lied
when I said I loved you.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.348
And it wasn't no lie
when I said

31:58.380 --> 31:59.699
you was the only one
for me.

31:59.750 --> 32:00.944
You know that.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.242
You sure about that?

32:02.280 --> 32:05.579
Me and Leanne was done
way before we even started.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.952
One-night stand ain't
no foundation for a marriage.

32:07.990 --> 32:09.287
( laughs )

32:09.320 --> 32:12.027
So that's supposed
to make things better?

32:12.060 --> 32:14.494
That a fling
put it on you so good

32:14.530 --> 32:16.293
you had to drop down
on one knee?

32:16.330 --> 32:17.695
It wasn't like that.

32:17.730 --> 32:20.198
I was trying to to do right
by her and that baby,

32:20.230 --> 32:22.289
so we got hitched.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.160
Then she lost the baby...

32:24.210 --> 32:26.599
and she got worse.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.177
And I was the only
shoulder she had.

32:29.210 --> 32:30.734
She has family.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.044
She got a cousin
that's a telephone operator

32:33.080 --> 32:36.470
that calls me every time
she gets off them pills.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.979
Well, it's funny that you...

32:42.020 --> 32:43.419
didn't mention any of this

32:43.460 --> 32:45.382
when you and I got going.

32:45.430 --> 32:48.593
You said you didn't want
to get married again.

32:48.630 --> 32:51.519
And me and Leanne
was way done.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.492
And I didn't risk you

32:53.530 --> 32:55.339
not wanting to start up
with me because of it,

32:55.370 --> 32:57.736
so I left the past
in the past.

33:00.070 --> 33:01.207
( scoffs )

33:01.240 --> 33:02.571
My big mama would
roll over in her grave

33:02.610 --> 33:05.545
if she saw I wasn't trying
to help anybody like that.

33:12.650 --> 33:14.413
Me and you,

33:14.460 --> 33:17.111
we ain't Jimmy Dale
and Leanne.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.526
We better than that.

33:25.530 --> 33:27.669
Are we that much better?

33:42.620 --> 33:43.143
( match scratches )

33:50.290 --> 33:51.780
Hey.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.286
Hey.

33:53.330 --> 33:54.399
He sleeping good?

33:54.430 --> 33:56.796
Better than us.

33:58.530 --> 34:02.068
You can make a pallet
in the living room to sleep on.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.692
I'll stay here with Blue.

34:05.310 --> 34:07.562
We could both stay.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.809
Violet:
Ralph Angel, come out here.

34:13.850 --> 34:15.477
( Ralph Angel sighs )

34:22.120 --> 34:23.712
Ralph Angel?

34:27.460 --> 34:28.757
Come here.

34:32.230 --> 34:33.720
( door closes )

34:43.380 --> 34:46.645
You making
a big mistake.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.775
I told you
about that girl.

34:54.920 --> 34:58.754
You letting her
right back in,
ain't you?

34:59.790 --> 35:04.227
Aunt Vi, please stay
out of something.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.229
For once.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.860
I told you about her,
and I did stay out of it.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.400
Look what happened.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.102
- Blue's what happened!
- That may be true.

35:17.380 --> 35:21.146
But can't nobody
trust that girl.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.648
After what she done
to Blue?

35:23.680 --> 35:26.114
- ( door opens
- To you? )

35:28.390 --> 35:29.709
( mumbles )

35:37.830 --> 35:40.867
I'm not my past mistakes,
Miss Violet.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.460
( sighs )

35:43.500 --> 35:46.537
These past 18 months,

35:46.570 --> 35:48.504
I've been clean.

35:49.810 --> 35:52.574
You come 18 years
from now saying that,

35:52.610 --> 35:54.271
and I'll believe it.

35:55.750 --> 35:58.685
You want me to wait
18 years

35:58.720 --> 36:00.745
before I get my son back?

36:02.490 --> 36:03.684
Get him back?

36:05.690 --> 36:08.523
If it were up to me,
you wouldn't lay eyes
on him.

36:12.830 --> 36:15.833
I want...

36:17.470 --> 36:18.903
to thank you.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.601
( sniffles )

36:22.980 --> 36:27.269
I never got the chance
to say thank you,
Miss Violet.

36:37.390 --> 36:39.858
And I want to thank you.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.949
You saw me

36:44.000 --> 36:46.560
at my lowest point.

36:48.700 --> 36:51.567
You saw me in hell.

36:54.010 --> 36:57.207
I didn't even want
to eXIst anymore.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.238
Not breathe.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.347
Not see.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.209
Not hear.

37:09.620 --> 37:11.759
Love couldn't even
reach me.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.228
And you picked up my baby.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.918
Gently.

37:27.010 --> 37:29.535
I remember.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.002
( sniffles )

37:31.040 --> 37:34.646
And I remember you
running that man out
of that motel room.

37:36.750 --> 37:39.981
And you could have
yelled at me

37:40.020 --> 37:42.284
and cursed me.

37:44.020 --> 37:47.786
But I remember you
covering me up

37:47.830 --> 37:51.891
and saying,
"God bless you, girl."

37:51.930 --> 37:53.329
( sniffles )

37:56.540 --> 37:58.735
I remember that.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.076
And when you walked out
of that door,

38:04.110 --> 38:05.839
I thought...

38:09.420 --> 38:10.842
"Thank God."

38:15.620 --> 38:18.680
"Thank God,
Blue will be okay."

38:22.060 --> 38:24.290
So, I thank you.

38:27.570 --> 38:29.663
Both of you.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.368
And I want to make amends.

38:36.610 --> 38:39.340
I want to pay back
my debts...

38:41.050 --> 38:44.315
and bring goodness to where
I brought discord.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.986
That's all I'm trying to do.

38:52.430 --> 38:53.988
And I hope...

38:58.430 --> 39:01.991
I hope that one day
you'll see fit to let me.

41:36.860 --> 41:38.054
( sighs )

42:01.210 --> 42:02.871
( sighs )

42:35.950 --> 42:38.009
( music playing )
