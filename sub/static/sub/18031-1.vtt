53:27.593 --> 53:31.905
Long, long ago,
in a faraway land across the sea,

53:32.113 --> 53:34.752
there lived a little boy
who considered himself

53:34.913 --> 53:38.588
quite an authority on brave,
fearless knights.

53:38.753 --> 53:42.871
And their mortal enemies,
those horrible fire-breathing dragons

53:43.033 --> 53:45.831
that daily terrorize the countryside.

53:45.993 --> 53:51.465
One afternoon as the boy sat
deeply engrossed in his favourite su...

53:58.833 --> 54:01.870
- Good afternoon, Father.
- Oh, son, I seen it.

54:02.033 --> 54:05.628
Up on the bounds it was,
all covered with scales and such.

54:05.793 --> 54:07.749
And a tail with a sort of a hook on it.

54:07.913 --> 54:09.585
Now wait until I catch my breath.

54:09.753 --> 54:12.586
It's horrible. That's what it is, horrible.

54:12.753 --> 54:14.550
It's only a dragon, Father.

54:16.233 --> 54:17.905
Only a dragon?!

54:18.073 --> 54:20.109
Oh, the village!

54:20.273 --> 54:24.425
Help! There's a dragon coming! Help!

54:24.593 --> 54:27.551
Don't worry, Father.
I'll have a look at him.

55:13.193 --> 55:14.228
Hello, Dragon.

55:15.233 --> 55:18.589
Oh, now, boy. Don't you throw stones
at me or squirt water or anything

55:18.793 --> 55:20.067
I won't have it.

55:20.953 --> 55:24.229
Oh, I just came for a friendly chat.
But if I'm not wanted...

55:24.393 --> 55:26.827
Oh, well, do be seated.

55:28.113 --> 55:31.230
- Well, thank you.
- But if you don't mind...

55:31.553 --> 55:33.464
the other way, please?

55:39.033 --> 55:40.102
I'll only be a minute.

55:41.833 --> 55:43.949
Have you had any nice battles lately?

55:44.113 --> 55:45.387
Battle?

55:45.553 --> 55:48.670
Oh, no, no. No battles. No.

55:50.793 --> 55:53.227
Oh, probably too busy
scourging our countryside

55:53.393 --> 55:54.826
and devouring fair damsels, then.

55:55.433 --> 56:00.029
Scourging, devouring?
Good heavens, no.

56:00.673 --> 56:03.141
But don't you ever
do anything desperate?

56:03.513 --> 56:06.107
Well, yes, I...

56:08.193 --> 56:10.309
I do make up poetry.

56:10.473 --> 56:12.065
Poetry?

56:12.233 --> 56:13.586
Verses, you know.

56:14.273 --> 56:15.706
Care to hear my latest sonnet?

56:15.873 --> 56:18.341
- Well, I...
- Oh, you'll love this.

56:18.513 --> 56:21.664
I call it "Just A-Drifting."

56:22.473 --> 56:26.386
Just a-drifting o'er the leaves
Like a dewdrop, fancy-free

56:26.553 --> 56:30.228
Playing with the gentle breezes
Romping with the bumblebeeses

56:30.633 --> 56:34.228
Oh, what fun, Joy never ceases

56:34.393 --> 56:37.226
Just a-drifting

56:37.873 --> 56:40.341
Very nice.
But you're in for trouble, you know.

56:40.513 --> 56:43.027
- Trouble?
- My father's arousing the village.

56:43.193 --> 56:46.071
And they'll be here with spears
and things to exterminate you.

56:46.273 --> 56:48.229
You're an enemy of the human race.

56:48.393 --> 56:51.271
Oh, I haven't an enemy in the world.

56:51.673 --> 56:52.742
Too nice to make them.

56:52.913 --> 56:57.225
Prancing, dancing to and fro
Not too fast, not too slow

56:57.393 --> 57:01.784
Where the early birds are seeking
Early worms are slyly peeking

57:02.113 --> 57:08.143
Hear the night owls softly squeaking
Just a-drifting

57:16.033 --> 57:17.705
Hey, what's all the excitement?

57:18.233 --> 57:20.269
It's Sir Giles, stupid.

57:20.433 --> 57:22.628
Sir Giles?

57:26.273 --> 57:29.470
Hooray for Sir Giles.

57:29.913 --> 57:31.710
Hooray for Sir Giles.

57:31.873 --> 57:34.945
Hooray for the dragon-killer.

57:35.113 --> 57:37.183
Hooray for the dra...

57:37.353 --> 57:38.752
Dragon-killer.

57:38.913 --> 57:40.187
Oh, gosh.

57:58.553 --> 58:00.191
It's all out, Dragon.

58:00.353 --> 58:01.388
He's coming.

58:01.553 --> 58:03.350
- He's here now.
- Now, boy.

58:03.513 --> 58:05.504
It's impolite to interrupt a person.

58:10.633 --> 58:13.101
- Who's coming?
- Sir Giles.

58:13.273 --> 58:15.912
On a big horse
with a long sword and spear.

58:16.193 --> 58:18.468
You'll have to fight him.

58:18.673 --> 58:21.870
Oh, I never fight. I never did.

58:23.673 --> 58:25.789
- Doesn't agree with me.
- But... But... But...

58:25.953 --> 58:28.421
Now, boy, now, boy. Just run along.

58:28.593 --> 58:30.106
Tell Sir Giles to go home.

58:30.273 --> 58:32.264
I'm sure you can arrange it.

58:32.433 --> 58:34.025
Toodle-loo.

58:41.313 --> 58:42.985
All right, now. All right, off you go.

58:43.153 --> 58:44.950
Sir Giles can't be disturbed.

58:45.113 --> 58:46.831
Sure, he's in conference, he is.

58:46.993 --> 58:50.986
There ain't no one, absolutely no one,
can see Sir Giles.

58:51.193 --> 58:54.549
Now off you go. Off you go.
Away with you.

59:13.353 --> 59:15.583
Excuse me, sir. I've come to...

59:20.433 --> 59:22.344
Sir Giles, I presume?

59:22.513 --> 59:25.823
Come, come, come, lad.
Stop mumbling.

59:26.553 --> 59:29.226
- I came to talk about the Dragon.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

59:29.393 --> 59:32.829
Another tale of woe and misery,
I suppose.

59:32.993 --> 59:35.826
Devoured your flocks, no doubt.

59:36.633 --> 59:38.225
Oh, no, sir. He...

59:38.433 --> 59:40.424
Made off with your loving parents,
has he?

59:40.593 --> 59:43.949
Well, they shall be avenged.

59:46.473 --> 59:48.623
- You don't understand.
- What?

59:48.793 --> 59:52.832
Don't tell me
he's kidnapped some fair damsel.

59:52.993 --> 59:59.102
With flaxen hair and ruby lips
and form divine.

59:59.873 --> 01:00:02.103
Why, he can't do that to her.

01:00:02.273 --> 01:00:05.071
He shall pay dearly
on the field of battle.

01:00:05.233 --> 01:00:07.349
But that's just it. He won't fight.

01:00:07.513 --> 01:00:08.912
Yes, he...

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:11.462
He won't fight?

01:00:11.633 --> 01:00:16.582
Preposterous.
The fellow must be an infernal cad.

01:00:16.753 --> 01:00:18.505
Bit of a rotter, what?

01:00:18.873 --> 01:00:22.661
He is not. He's a nice old dragon
who likes to write poetry.

01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:24.312
Poetry?

01:00:24.473 --> 01:00:25.701
Yes, you know, verses?

01:00:25.993 --> 01:00:28.587
How jolly.

01:00:28.753 --> 01:00:32.063
I'm a bit of a bard myself, you know.

01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:34.667
- You a poet too?
- Yes.

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:38.109
No doubt you heard
of my "Ode to a Fleecy Cloud"?

01:00:38.313 --> 01:00:40.668
- Well, I...
- Oh, fleecy cloud

01:00:40.993 --> 01:00:42.711
O cloud of fleece

01:00:42.913 --> 01:00:46.428
Up in the sky so high

01:00:47.513 --> 01:00:48.548
Oh, my.

01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:50.387
Oh, my.

01:00:50.553 --> 01:00:53.750
But come, come. Let's not dilly-dally.

01:00:53.913 --> 01:00:56.473
We must meet this fine fellow at once.

01:00:56.633 --> 01:00:59.227
Then you'll explain to the Dragon
about the fight?

01:00:59.393 --> 01:01:00.593
Yes, quite right. Quite right.

01:01:00.753 --> 01:01:02.833
Of course, of course, of course.
Quite, quite, quite.

01:01:06.073 --> 01:01:07.711
I'm the reluctant dragon

01:01:07.913 --> 01:01:09.710
What ho!
Quite so

01:01:09.873 --> 01:01:11.352
The very reluctant dragon

01:01:11.513 --> 01:01:13.663
Oh, very, very Don't you know

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:15.869
They call me the timid dragon

01:01:16.033 --> 01:01:17.591
What rot!
I'm not!

01:01:17.753 --> 01:01:19.789
I just won't fight
I'd rather play

01:01:19.953 --> 01:01:22.547
- I know I shan't get hurt that way
- Hello, Dragon.

01:01:22.753 --> 01:01:25.950
Oh, hello, boy.
I'm having a picnic.

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:29.072
- I brought a friend to explain about...
- Oh, well, well, splendid.

01:01:29.233 --> 01:01:33.385
The more, the merrier. Now, boy,
you sit here and your friend can sit there.

01:01:33.553 --> 01:01:34.906
- Thank you.
- Now, let's see now.

01:01:35.073 --> 01:01:38.304
Pickles, jam, muffins, tea. Oh, yes.

01:01:38.473 --> 01:01:42.591
Here, do have a jam sandwich, sir...?

01:01:42.753 --> 01:01:44.948
Sir...?

01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:47.583
What did you say
your friend's name was?

01:01:47.753 --> 01:01:49.425
Oh, that's Sir Giles.

01:01:49.593 --> 01:01:51.788
Sir Giles. Well, well.

01:01:51.953 --> 01:01:55.104
Yes, you know, the dragon-killer.

01:02:03.713 --> 01:02:06.352
Sir Giles,
you better tell the Dragon, quick.

01:02:06.513 --> 01:02:08.504
Oh, yes, of course.

01:02:08.673 --> 01:02:10.823
Hey, you know,

01:02:11.633 --> 01:02:14.067
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

01:02:14.633 --> 01:02:19.707
The boy here tells me
you're quite an accomplished poet.

01:02:20.673 --> 01:02:23.790
- Oh, he did, really?
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:29.863
And if it's not too much bother,
I'd be pleased to hear you recite.

01:02:30.033 --> 01:02:34.390
Oh, my dear, dear fellow, no bother.
No bother at all.

01:02:35.033 --> 01:02:37.422
Would you care for a sandwich?

01:02:38.393 --> 01:02:40.224
Thank you. Jam.

01:02:40.393 --> 01:02:41.792
Here. Do have another sandwich

01:02:41.953 --> 01:02:45.184
and a piece of cake and a crumpet
and a lolly and a spot of tea.

01:02:47.833 --> 01:02:49.186
Thank you.

01:02:50.113 --> 01:02:54.823
This... This is called
"To An Upside-down Cake".

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.591
Sweet little upside-down cake

01:02:58.793 --> 01:03:01.705
Cares and woes, you've got them.

01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:05.104
Poor little upside-down cake

01:03:05.273 --> 01:03:07.423
Your top is on your bottom.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:10.188
Alas, little upside-down cake

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.662
Your troubles never stop

01:03:13.153 --> 01:03:16.668
Because, little upside-down cake

01:03:21.633 --> 01:03:24.511
Your bottom's on your top

01:03:25.393 --> 01:03:28.191
Bravo. Quite interesting. Extraordinary.

01:03:28.353 --> 01:03:31.186
Now, Sir Giles. Tell the Dragon now.

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:32.911
Oh, yes, of course.

01:03:33.073 --> 01:03:37.863
You know, I am a bit of a bard myself.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.628
Really? Oh, how nice.

01:03:40.793 --> 01:03:43.023
Yes, yes, yes. Quite, quite.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.623
Radish so red

01:03:45.793 --> 01:03:48.626
Radish so red

01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:50.789
Plucked from the heart

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:53.421
Of your warm little bed

01:03:53.833 --> 01:03:55.551
Sprinkled with salt

01:03:55.713 --> 01:03:58.625
On the top of your head

01:04:03.513 --> 01:04:04.628
Delicious

01:04:04.793 --> 01:04:08.786
Oh, that's exquisite. Simply exquisite.

01:04:08.953 --> 01:04:10.909
Yes, of course. You're quite right.

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:13.343
Do you mind if I recite a poem?

01:04:13.513 --> 01:04:16.630
You, boy? Why... Oh, not at all.

01:04:16.793 --> 01:04:20.308
Oh, of course, of course.
Rather, rather.

01:04:20.673 --> 01:04:22.311
'Tis evening

01:04:22.513 --> 01:04:23.912
From the stars above

01:04:24.513 --> 01:04:27.186
A soft mysterious light

01:04:27.353 --> 01:04:29.662
Brings thoughts of friendship

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:31.949
Joy and love

01:04:32.113 --> 01:04:33.751
Now how about that fight?!

01:04:34.753 --> 01:04:36.106
Splendid. Quite.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:37.991
Fight? Fight?

01:04:38.153 --> 01:04:41.941
There's nothing to fight about.
Besides, I don't believe in it.

01:04:42.433 --> 01:04:44.185
But dragons and knights always fight.

01:04:44.353 --> 01:04:47.186
- That's right, by Jove.
- You can't disappoint the whole village.

01:04:47.353 --> 01:04:50.504
- Not cricket, you know.
- Please, I...

01:04:50.673 --> 01:04:53.745
I do not wish to discuss it further.

01:04:53.953 --> 01:04:56.103
I refuse to listen.

01:04:56.433 --> 01:04:59.550
I absolutely will not fight.

01:04:59.913 --> 01:05:01.904
Good night.

01:05:06.113 --> 01:05:08.911
Well, you know, it's a shame.

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:10.631
It doesn't seem right.

01:05:11.153 --> 01:05:13.030
This is really a beautiful spot.

01:05:13.193 --> 01:05:16.868
- For a fight.
- Yes, quite right.

01:05:17.033 --> 01:05:19.866
Why, I can almost see it.
The flags are waving.

01:05:20.033 --> 01:05:21.512
The people are cheering.

01:05:21.673 --> 01:05:23.948
- Bands are playing.
- The Dragon appears.

01:05:24.113 --> 01:05:26.627
What a beautiful sight,

01:05:26.793 --> 01:05:28.829
with his scales all agleam

01:05:28.993 --> 01:05:31.382
in the dawn's early light.

01:05:32.073 --> 01:05:33.950
You're just flattering me.

01:05:34.113 --> 01:05:36.388
Oh, no, fellow. It's true.

01:05:36.553 --> 01:05:39.989
That beautiful damsel
throws flowers at you.

01:05:40.273 --> 01:05:42.104
- At me?
- At you.

01:05:42.393 --> 01:05:45.191
As I ramp and I roar, I cut quite a figure.

01:05:45.393 --> 01:05:48.385
Sir Giles has a spear just like this,
only bigger.

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:51.272
I get set for the charge and...

01:05:51.433 --> 01:05:52.832
Did you say spear?

01:05:52.993 --> 01:05:54.392
Yes, spear.

01:05:55.753 --> 01:05:57.186
Oh, dear.

01:05:57.393 --> 01:06:00.066
No. I'll get hurt. I won't do it. Good day.

01:06:00.233 --> 01:06:02.588
Just a second, old chap.

01:06:02.753 --> 01:06:04.744
We might fix it this way.

01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:11.388
You mean:

01:06:15.353 --> 01:06:17.423
Quite so.

01:06:18.793 --> 01:06:20.624
But are you sure it's quite honest?

01:06:20.793 --> 01:06:22.306
Just a second, we'll look.

01:06:24.633 --> 01:06:26.783
Nothing against it here in the book.

01:06:26.953 --> 01:06:29.831
No, nothing against it here in the book.

01:06:30.033 --> 01:06:32.672
If it looks like a battle,
I'm sure it's all right.

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:35.791
Very well, then, it's settled.
Tomorrow, we fight.

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:37.233
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:38.712
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:06:38.873 --> 01:06:40.750
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:06:40.913 --> 01:06:44.269
There's going to be a fight
There's going to be a fight

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:45.861
A fight.

01:06:47.233 --> 01:06:51.863
Boy. Sir Giles. Wait a minute.
Oh, wait, please.

01:06:52.433 --> 01:06:56.267
Oh, why don't
I keep my big mouth shut?

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:02.270
So the next day, the villagers gathered
to see the valiant knight

01:07:02.473 --> 01:07:08.264
engage the bloodthirsty Dragon
in a battle to the finish.

01:07:08.953 --> 01:07:11.865
- So I am getting 20-to-1 on Sir Giles.
- That's twopence on the Dragon.

01:07:12.073 --> 01:07:13.993
All right, on the Dragon.
Twopence on the Dragon.

01:07:14.153 --> 01:07:15.791
You're a smart one.

01:07:15.953 --> 01:07:20.310
Balloons. Only a bit for a balloon.
They're amusing, inexpensive.

01:07:20.473 --> 01:07:23.590
A nice side seat and a nice side spot.

01:07:23.753 --> 01:07:26.187
Here now, mind your step, lady.
Mind your step.

01:07:26.353 --> 01:07:28.913
Look, the Dragon ain't got a chance.

01:07:29.073 --> 01:07:31.064
Aye, he'll do the Dragon in.

01:07:40.873 --> 01:07:45.310
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!

01:08:11.993 --> 01:08:13.506
It's no use.

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:15.550
You might as well
tell the people to go away.

01:08:15.713 --> 01:08:17.350
I can't do it.

01:08:17.513 --> 01:08:21.346
- Oh, but try again.
- You've got to be mad to breathe fire.

01:08:21.513 --> 01:08:23.549
But I'm not mad at anybody.

01:08:24.153 --> 01:08:27.111
But try real hard. Concentrate.

01:08:40.673 --> 01:08:42.390
Not very good, is it?

01:08:42.712 --> 01:08:47.627
Nope. Too bad you're not a real dragon
instead of a punk poet.

01:08:48.353 --> 01:08:50.344
Punk poet?!

01:08:51.153 --> 01:08:52.142
Oh, say that again.

01:08:52.353 --> 01:08:54.024
- Punk poet.
- Again.

01:08:54.193 --> 01:08:55.341
- Punk poet!
- Again.

01:08:55.553 --> 01:08:56.872
Punk poet!

01:08:57.033 --> 01:09:00.662
- Oh, I'm mad, I'm mad!
- Punk poet! Punk poet! Punk poet!

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.060
Punk poet!

01:09:02.233 --> 01:09:03.551
Oh, again, again!

01:09:03.712 --> 01:09:05.544
Punk poet!

01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:09.466
By Jove.

01:09:40.953 --> 01:09:42.944
Hooray for the Dragon!

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:47.743
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

01:10:12.113 --> 01:10:13.592
Dragon.

01:10:13.753 --> 01:10:15.425
Dragon.

01:10:15.753 --> 01:10:16.868
Extraordinary.

01:10:17.033 --> 01:10:18.591
Why, he's disappeared.

01:10:19.673 --> 01:10:22.426
- Here I am.
- Oh, so you are.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:24.982
- Am I doing all right?
- I say, old boy.

01:10:25.193 --> 01:10:28.822
Stop acting the silly ass, will you?

01:10:29.953 --> 01:10:31.545
Help! Oh, no!

01:10:32.273 --> 01:10:34.150
Oh, help!

01:10:37.353 --> 01:10:38.911
- I say, you hack...!
- No, no stop it!

01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:41.792
- Oh, no, stop! Stop it! Oh, no, you can't!
- That's it. Steady now.

01:10:41.953 --> 01:10:44.592
- You can't do that!
- Raise the gate. Raise the gate. Hey.

01:10:44.753 --> 01:10:46.425
No, no, no. No, fire.

01:10:48.633 --> 01:10:50.430
It's horrible, ain't it?

01:10:50.873 --> 01:10:53.467
- Oh, no!
- Help, please.

01:10:53.673 --> 01:10:55.664
One lump or two? Help!

01:10:55.833 --> 01:10:56.868
Don't mind if I do.

01:10:57.033 --> 01:11:00.787
- Hey, you vulgar...!
- Help! Help!

01:11:00.953 --> 01:11:02.864
Now I'll chase you.

01:11:03.873 --> 01:11:07.548
- Help! Oh, no, no, no.
- Hey!

01:11:07.713 --> 01:11:09.032
- Help!
- Steady now.

01:11:09.233 --> 01:11:10.302
Hey, Sir Giles.

01:11:11.993 --> 01:11:13.665
Egad.

01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:19.107
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray!

01:11:19.313 --> 01:11:22.544
Hooray, Dragon! Hooray!

01:11:24.073 --> 01:11:25.711
Hooray, Sir Giles!

01:11:25.873 --> 01:11:27.465
Hooray, Dragon!

01:11:27.633 --> 01:11:29.749
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!

01:11:29.913 --> 01:11:31.869
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!

01:11:32.033 --> 01:11:33.466
Hooray, Sir Giles! Hooray, Dragon!

01:11:38.073 --> 01:11:40.428
- Help!
- Take that!

01:11:40.593 --> 01:11:43.744
- Horrible!
- Hey, cut it out! No, no, no.

01:11:44.313 --> 01:11:46.349
- Help!
- Take that!

01:11:46.833 --> 01:11:49.905
- Stop it. Oh, no.
- Stay the game.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:51.791
The time has come, you know.

01:11:52.153 --> 01:11:55.145
- You mean I die now?
- Oh, yes, indeed.

01:11:55.313 --> 01:11:59.386
As per agreed,
we'll seal our pact, old thing.

01:11:59.913 --> 01:12:01.392
Take that!

01:12:19.033 --> 01:12:21.991
- Hooray!
- Hooray for Sir Giles!

01:12:23.353 --> 01:12:25.583
And so as per agreed,

01:12:25.753 --> 01:12:29.348
Sir Giles completely reformed
this ferocious dragon,

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:34.104
whereupon the satisfied villagers
welcomed him into society.

01:12:34.273 --> 01:12:36.264
Speech, speech, speech!

01:12:36.433 --> 01:12:39.630
I promise not to rant or roar

01:12:40.993 --> 01:12:44.986
and scourge the countryside anymore.
