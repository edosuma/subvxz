WEBVTT

01:10.208 --> 01:12.458
- Break, break, break, break!
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:12.542 --> 01:13.959
I'm not going down, Mo.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.291
Attaboy, Jerry, attaboy!
Come on, now.

01:26.375 --> 01:27.917
You're my great white hope.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.125
That's it. That's it!

01:37.208 --> 01:38.375
Stop it.
No more!

01:42.583 --> 01:43.959
I love you, Jerry.

01:45.917 --> 01:47.667
You're killing him,
don't you see?

01:49.583 --> 01:51.250
That's it!

01:58.917 --> 02:01.792
Doctor! We need a doctor.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.709
- Holy Christ!
- My God!

02:31.041 --> 02:33.041
I arrived for
morning visits when

02:33.125 --> 02:35.667
Sonny had taken
a turn for the worst.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.583
- Sonny Carroll?
- Yes.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.875
He has information on a prize
fighter who was killed?

02:39.959 --> 02:41.041
That's right.

02:41.125 --> 02:43.375
Sonny hasn't made
a last confession.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.291
He wanted to talk
to you first.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.166
- 'Sonny?'
- 'Hmm?'

02:56.250 --> 02:57.750
The police are here.

02:57.834 --> 03:00.667
This is Detective Rush
and Lieutenant
Stillman.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.291
Hi, Sonny.

03:02.375 --> 03:05.291
'Course, you'd have to
be a pretty, young gal.

03:05.375 --> 03:07.000
Serves me right.

03:07.083 --> 03:12.792
Sonny, you officiated at
a boxing match back in 1976?

03:12.875 --> 03:14.917
And that kid
died in the ring.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.750
Who died?

03:16.834 --> 03:18.417
Jerry Stone.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.583
'What a gutless wonder.'

03:21.834 --> 03:23.208
Jerry was gutless?

03:23.291 --> 03:25.000
No, me.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.083
I should've
stopped the
fight.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.458
Stopped it because
Jerry was hurt?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.667
Real bad.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.542
(Rush)
'Why didn't you?'

03:33.625 --> 03:36.250
My hand was in the pot.

03:38.041 --> 03:39.625
Someone paid you off, Sonny?

03:40.959 --> 03:43.125
Fifteen hundred dollars.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.917
That was the deal.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.667
To not stop a fight
that should've been stopped?

03:51.458 --> 03:52.792
Sonny?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.667
Do you really think
he'll forgive?

04:14.458 --> 04:16.709
So, someone wants
to do Jerry harm.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.375
And pays Sonny 1500

04:19.458 --> 04:21.625
to let the fight go on
longer than it should.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.375
But Sonny didn't say who.

04:26.709 --> 04:28.291
And he's not going to.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.208
- Hey.
- How's it going?

05:08.291 --> 05:09.875
What's up?

05:09.959 --> 05:11.041
On my way in.

05:11.125 --> 05:12.792
Thought I'd stop
by.
I called, but..

05:12.875 --> 05:15.125
Ah, I must have
been in the shower.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.041
I hit your cell phone
a couple of three times,
too.

05:17.125 --> 05:21.709
Yeah, my cell.
I think I left it at work.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.750
Mind if I come in?

05:25.834 --> 05:27.625
Yeah, okay.
If you want.

05:32.542 --> 05:33.834
Have a seat.

05:35.959 --> 05:38.375
What's up with
your furniture?

05:38.458 --> 05:39.625
What do you mean?

05:39.709 --> 05:42.041
Your setup is horrible.

05:42.125 --> 05:45.542
Couldn't be more...awkward.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.583
I was about
to skip some rope.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.000
Gotcha.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.375
So how long have you
been doing this?

05:53.667 --> 05:55.917
Since, uh...Pee-Wees.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.083
Wrestling.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.542
No, I mean pushing back
the furniture.

05:59.625 --> 06:00.834
Huh.

06:00.917 --> 06:03.917
Eh, I don't like the gym.

06:04.000 --> 06:04.917
What, too much room?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.959
Nah, just too many people.

06:09.542 --> 06:12.125
Listen, Scotty, I, uh..

06:12.208 --> 06:17.125
...just wanted to say
when my wife died..

06:17.208 --> 06:20.792
Well, I've been
where you've been.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.333
Yeah, I know.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.291
So, if you ever
want to talk..

06:35.291 --> 06:36.917
I guess, you'll let me know.

06:42.959 --> 06:47.291
Jerry Stone, 24, died in the
ring after going 15 rounds

06:47.375 --> 06:49.208
with Maurice "Mad Mo" Bell.

06:49.291 --> 06:53.041
Autopsy showed massive swelling
on the brain as cause of death.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.083
So, no question the punches
he took, killed him.

06:55.166 --> 06:59.000
"Top Dog Boxing Club.
December 19, 1976.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.417
Rocky vs. Apollo,
the real thing."

07:01.500 --> 07:02.583
Hmm, what's that about?

07:02.667 --> 07:04.333
The idea of the fight
was to try

07:04.417 --> 07:05.667
'and recreate "Rocky"

07:05.750 --> 07:06.917
'the hot movie at the time.'

07:07.000 --> 07:08.083
Sort of gimmicky, huh?

07:08.166 --> 07:10.333
Ah, supposedly,
it lived up to the
hype.

07:10.417 --> 07:12.500
Till someone got killed.

07:12.583 --> 07:13.959
Nick, the other fighter, Mo

07:14.041 --> 07:15.417
was he questioned
first time around?

07:15.500 --> 07:18.125
The assigned put him
through his paces but..

07:18.208 --> 07:20.000
...boxer dies in the ring,
what are you gonna do?

07:20.083 --> 07:21.583
But knowing the referee
was on the take

07:21.667 --> 07:22.834
that changes everything.

07:22.917 --> 07:24.959
So we figure out
who paid Sonny.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.875
Maybe, Gina will know.

07:27.959 --> 07:29.750
- Who's that?
- Sonny's daughter.

07:29.834 --> 07:31.166
And Jerry's girlfriend.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.166
Says here she was ringside
when Jerry died.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.750
So Gina looks on,
as her own dad

07:35.834 --> 07:38.000
allows her boyfriend
to get beat to death.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.792
Mm-hmm. Maybe, explains why
she wasn't ringside today.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.667
- Mmm.
- She wasn't at the hospital?

07:45.792 --> 07:47.417
Start with her.

07:56.291 --> 07:59.583
Jerry was short on talent.
Big on heart.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.542
He said, that's why
they picked him for the fight.

08:01.625 --> 08:04.458
Because, they knew
he'd never quit.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.709
No matter how
badly he was
hurt?

08:06.792 --> 08:10.250
No, he'd stay in and take
the punishment, like Rocky
did.

08:10.333 --> 08:14.166
'Now you add a referee who's
willing to let that happen.'

08:15.333 --> 08:16.959
Gina, any idea
on who could've

08:17.041 --> 08:18.625
paid your dad that money?

08:18.709 --> 08:20.250
No.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.667
Well, how about someone
who had a problem with Jerry?

08:23.750 --> 08:26.125
- Besides Sonny, you mean?
- Yeah.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.667
Nah.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.291
So, Sonny didn't
care for Jerry?

08:30.375 --> 08:34.375
At 15, he made it very clear
that I wasn't to see him.

08:34.458 --> 08:35.834
He said he was a bum.

08:35.917 --> 08:37.083
How so?

08:37.166 --> 08:38.583
He dropped
out of
school.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.500
Didn't work.

08:40.583 --> 08:43.000
But he could always
hustle up money to
drink.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.500
So how is it
you two got together?

08:46.583 --> 08:49.625
Just another Friday night
going nowhere, and..

08:49.709 --> 08:52.750
Then I saw something
that my father
couldn't.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.959
(Gina)
'Drinking those eggs
was so gross.'

09:00.041 --> 09:03.917
- What about his apartment?
- Yeah, that too.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.083
(Wendy)
'Isn't that Jerry Stone?'

09:09.166 --> 09:11.625
Sshh.
Hi, Jerry.

09:11.709 --> 09:12.834
Hey.

09:12.917 --> 09:13.959
Oh, my gosh.

09:14.041 --> 09:16.083
What happened to your face?

09:16.166 --> 09:17.709
My face?

09:17.792 --> 09:18.959
Gina here can't
stop looking at it.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.083
Okay!

09:21.250 --> 09:23.709
Hey, I'll see you
in a minute.

09:28.041 --> 09:29.333
Did you like the movie?

09:29.417 --> 09:32.000
Uh, the love story part.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.166
You sort of look like Adrian.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.500
I do?

09:38.166 --> 09:39.875
Me, I've seen the
flick three times.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.375
Yeah, 15 bucks for
a locker and a corner
man.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.917
Five dollar charge
for
shower and towel.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.792
Hmm..

09:49.625 --> 09:51.208
And very true to life.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.333
So, uh..

09:54.417 --> 09:56.000
...my looks are
comin' on, huh?

09:57.458 --> 10:00.166
I said you look...different,
that's all.

10:00.250 --> 10:01.333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:01.417 --> 10:02.750
'Cause I feel different.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.709
Oh?

10:07.083 --> 10:09.333
This movie's got me thinking..

10:09.417 --> 10:14.166
...if some bum wants to be
President of the United
States..

10:14.250 --> 10:15.500
...he really can be.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.917
President, huh?
Hmm?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.792
Well, I guess, I better
work
on winning a few fights
first.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.458
My record's not so hot.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.083
I gotta go do my roadwork.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.792
Jerry..

10:42.041 --> 10:46.125
Are you...looking
for your own Adrian?

10:48.625 --> 10:50.083
Are you for real?

10:51.417 --> 10:52.500
Uh-huh.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.083
So that was..

10:59.166 --> 11:00.917
...the beginning
of me and Jerry.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.667
And the end of you
and Sonny?

11:05.291 --> 11:08.291
Yeah, I...I told him
that Jerry had
changed.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.250
I said, there was
no stopping him
now.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.041
But Sonny didn't believe it.

11:15.291 --> 11:17.667
Gina, just so you know..

11:17.750 --> 11:20.458
...your dad was genuinely
sorry about Jerry.

11:22.125 --> 11:23.583
Yeah, too bad
he didn't feel that
way

11:23.667 --> 11:26.083
before he let
Mad Mo kill
him.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.333
Detective Will Jeffries, Mo.

11:32.417 --> 11:33.917
My partner,
Detective Vera.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.250
Hmm. Where y'all
park the car, man?

11:37.333 --> 11:39.583
Up on the
corner.
We're good.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.583
Yo, Booger.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.375
Some good looking out
for Philly's finest.

11:47.834 --> 11:50.208
You snug as
a bug now, baby.

11:50.291 --> 11:53.250
- Let's talk about Jerry
Stone.
- Come on.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.750
At the weigh-in, you said,
you were gonna murder Jerry.

11:55.834 --> 11:57.625
For real, then you did.

11:57.709 --> 12:00.375
Hey-hey,
just talking bads, man.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.875
Selling them tickets.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.583
What about the press
conference when you were

12:03.667 --> 12:05.041
talking up some
black and white stuff?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.625
Ah, just pointing up
the differences.

12:07.709 --> 12:09.625
Our people was
into James Brown.

12:09.709 --> 12:12.625
Jerry Stone and y'all might
have
rather been square dancing.

12:12.709 --> 12:15.291
- That ain't racist.
- It is, a little bit.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.500
Still, it don't mean
I murdered him.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.458
(Will)
'Mo, we looked into
your juvenile records.'

12:20.542 --> 12:22.542
Arrested nine times
before you were 15.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.792
Two years in lockup for
putting step-pops in a
coma?

12:25.875 --> 12:27.333
Those records supposed
to be sealed.

12:27.417 --> 12:28.542
Don't worry.

12:28.625 --> 12:29.792
We taped 'em back up.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.208
I didn't even know
who Jerry Stone was.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.417
I-I didn't want to take
that fight in the first
place.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.250
- Why not?
- Well, cat was what?

12:36.333 --> 12:39.834
15-18-3, something
terrible like that.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.000
What's beating a chump
like that gonna do for
me?

12:42.083 --> 12:44.625
- So why did you fight him?
- Tommy Sugar.

12:44.709 --> 12:46.125
The promoter of the fight.

12:46.208 --> 12:49.333
Man could sell you a house
in the Atlantic Ocean.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.625
That's him,
in the maroon
trunks.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.792
Don't nobody care
about this cat.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.291
Wait, wait a minute. Look, how
many fights you won in a row?

13:06.375 --> 13:07.333
All of 'em.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.333
And 21 outta 22
was knockouts.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.792
And what one of 'em was
against a top-five contender?

13:11.875 --> 13:14.125
Ain't no top-five
giving me a fight, man.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.166
You want to know why?

13:15.250 --> 13:16.709
- Why?
- Publicity!

13:16.792 --> 13:19.291
You are a wrecking machine
but nobody knows you.

13:19.375 --> 13:22.375
But after I get done
with this fight, they
will.

13:22.458 --> 13:24.917
And fighting this fool
is gonna raise my status?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.542
Come on.

13:26.625 --> 13:30.041
Let me introduce you to one of
the great bleeders of all time.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.542
'Jerry Stone.'

13:32.625 --> 13:34.333
I've opened up faces
many a time.

13:34.417 --> 13:37.667
But he bleeds like this
tonight,
you'll

13:40.917 --> 13:42.000
Oh..

13:44.208 --> 13:47.500
It's like you said,
nobody cares about this cat.

13:47.583 --> 13:48.875
'I know I don't.'

13:48.959 --> 13:50.250
But everybody..

13:50.333 --> 13:52.250
...is gonna care about you.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.959
Yeah.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.750
Come on, Mo.
Huh?

13:57.834 --> 13:59.583
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.875
Come on.

14:02.959 --> 14:06.083
So you agreed to the fight
and took Jerry apart.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.291
The ref should've stopped it.

14:08.375 --> 14:10.250
I could tell white boy's
brain got wet.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.542
I'm killing him,
and he's hollering

14:12.625 --> 14:15.291
"He took the ring back,"
this kind of nonsense.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.458
Thing is, Mo,
<i>didn't</i>
rise.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.875
It went downhill
after that fight.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.959
Killing somebody has a way
of throwing a man off-track.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.583
(Will)
'Not for Tommy Sugar.'

14:24.667 --> 14:28.166
He's been Philly's top boxing
promoter the last 25 years.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.709
Well, that's some
truth.
And here's some more.

14:30.792 --> 14:34.709
The night Jerry Stone died
Tommy Sugar was born.

14:50.208 --> 14:53.041
It was 1976, the Bicentennial.

14:53.125 --> 14:56.834
And "Rocky" was as
American as it gets.

14:56.917 --> 14:58.709
And you saw a way
to exploit that.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.959
Saw opportunity.
For one and all.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.458
That kinda timing
don't come twice.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.458
Well, so the pressure was on.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.500
- This fight had to live up.
- No doubt.

15:07.583 --> 15:10.500
One thing for an underdog to go
15 rounds on the silver screen

15:10.583 --> 15:13.625
another to make that
happen in real life.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.417
A tribute to the young
men who fought.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.834
And you did nothing
to help it along?

15:20.583 --> 15:22.000
Like what?

15:22.083 --> 15:24.917
Jerry would bleed a lot,
which was a good thing, right?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.667
(Will)
'But if you were trying
to re-make "Rocky"'

15:26.750 --> 15:28.667
you need Jerry
to go 15 rounds.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.750
So you don't want
too much of a good thing.

15:30.834 --> 15:34.208
So maybe, as insurance, you
paid
the referee to keep it going.

15:34.291 --> 15:35.458
No matter what.

15:35.542 --> 15:38.917
- Sonny took a deal like
that?
- Yep.

15:40.166 --> 15:43.083
I wish I'd known
he was open for business.

15:43.166 --> 15:46.792
You know, where you ought
to be looking, is the CYO.

15:46.875 --> 15:51.083
- Catholic Youth Organization.
- Where I plucked Jerry from.

15:51.166 --> 15:53.417
About half a dozen fighters
came to me crying the blues

15:53.500 --> 15:55.000
after being overlooked.

15:55.083 --> 15:58.959
So one of these sore losers
from the CYO paid Sonny $1500

15:59.041 --> 16:02.000
to see Jerry take
the beating of his life?

16:02.083 --> 16:05.083
Your best fighters
always hold a grudge.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.000
The CYO was at its
height in the '70s.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.750
Instead of a kid sucking
on cigarettes all day long

16:18.834 --> 16:20.291
he had a place to go.

16:20.375 --> 16:23.333
And Jerry Stone
participated
in the boxing program?

16:23.417 --> 16:25.959
Jerry would serve mass
for me on Sunday mornings

16:26.041 --> 16:27.750
and then fight for
me on Sunday nights.

16:27.834 --> 16:30.333
Which eventually lands him
this bout with Mo.

16:30.417 --> 16:31.875
Right.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.208
Heard not everyone
was overjoyed by
that.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.500
You gotta remember that
these kids had their noses

16:36.583 --> 16:38.375
pressed right up against it.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.000
And along comes Jerry.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.917
He's got a chance at
a real professional fight.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.125
Well, anyone so jealous
they might wanna see

16:45.208 --> 16:46.750
real harm come to Jerry?

16:46.834 --> 16:49.083
Pay the ref off
to see that happen?

16:49.166 --> 16:52.000
Deep down, these guys knew they
were not better than Jerry.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.083
It's just a bunch
of
ham and eggers.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.750
Except, uh,
one of them, I guess.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.583
- Who?
- Bucky Lowsen.

16:58.667 --> 17:01.250
- Best fighter we had.
- Better than Jerry?

17:01.333 --> 17:03.750
They wanted more of an underdog.
He had too good a record.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.542
And how'd he deal with that?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.250
Bucky didn't like coming
in second to Jerry.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.083
And that seemed to be
happening quite a lot.

17:13.667 --> 17:14.750
Hey.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.417
Hey, can I borrow
the keys to the gym,
Father?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.250
I wanna work
the bags a
little.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.375
Mr. Carroll.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.500
Must think Rome
was built in a day.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.792
Go play some records.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.500
I'll be right over.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.500
You just won't give him
a chance, will you?

17:32.583 --> 17:34.750
Why should I?
A bum is a bum is a bum.

17:34.834 --> 17:36.291
Hey..

17:36.375 --> 17:37.834
Hey, I've been
looking for
you.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.500
- Buck.
- Don't "Buck" me, boy.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.291
(Buck)
'You get the message
I left you?'

17:41.375 --> 17:43.083
Look, Buck, this is
Mr. Sugar's fight.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.291
- You should talk to him.
- I did.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.083
My only way in that ring
is if you're out.

17:48.291 --> 17:50.959
I'm sorry,
I'm staying put.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.917
- We're not through here.
- Buck, Buck, back off.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.542
You want to start a
donnybrook,
start with me.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.583
Fine.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.375
Hey, Sonny?

18:05.458 --> 18:07.375
You seen Jimmy,
the jeweler lately?

18:07.458 --> 18:09.333
What are you talking about?

18:09.417 --> 18:12.458
Jerry purchased
a fancy engagement
ring.

18:12.542 --> 18:14.500
'He seems to think
he's gonna marry Gina.'

18:14.583 --> 18:15.667
Bucky, give it a rest.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.333
Or maybe, you fighting Mo

18:17.417 --> 18:18.834
ain't such a bad thing.

18:18.917 --> 18:20.792
'After he puts you in a coma'

18:20.875 --> 18:22.667
guess whose brawny
shoulder's gonna be there

18:22.750 --> 18:24.542
for Gina to cry on.

18:30.834 --> 18:34.000
- So Buck and Gina had
history.
- Sweethearts.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.792
- In high school?
- Elementary.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.750
He'd been carrying a torch
for her since the fifth
grade.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.083
How do you know that?

18:40.166 --> 18:41.667
Around here, if you
didn't get the story

18:41.750 --> 18:43.709
on some kid after the mass

18:43.792 --> 18:46.083
you believe your butt,
you will at the bar.

18:46.166 --> 18:50.083
So between losing both the
fight
and the girl to Jerry..

18:50.166 --> 18:51.750
Buck was having a rough go.

18:55.750 --> 18:57.291
Alright, Scotty,
I'll see you then.

18:57.375 --> 18:59.709
- Valens?
- Yeah.

18:59.792 --> 19:01.875
- H-he alright?
- We're gonna grab some drinks.

19:01.959 --> 19:04.291
Good.
Doing better than yesterday.

19:04.375 --> 19:07.000
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

19:07.083 --> 19:10.709
Buck Lowsen's got a record.
Two days before the fight

19:10.792 --> 19:12.625
Buck robbed a
convenience store.

19:12.709 --> 19:15.458
This says he was arrested
in '78, not '76.

19:15.542 --> 19:16.792
It took that long
to catch him.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.333
How much did
Buck get away with?

19:18.417 --> 19:20.709
Two thousand and a thing
of peanut butter.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.792
And two whole years
to spread it around.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.709
Yeah, but maybe,
he only took two days

19:24.792 --> 19:26.750
before he burned off
1500 of it.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.667
Right, 1500,
Sonny's asking price.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.917
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.125
Buck, I might even believe
you
if not for the timing.

19:41.208 --> 19:43.750
I mean, you never stole
anything else in your
life.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.250
That's the
God's
honest truth.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.709
Nothing before
that day or
after.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.333
Yeah, but that day's
the problem, Buck.

19:48.417 --> 19:50.166
Because it was two days
before the fight.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.917
- How do you explain that?
- I can't.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.542
Start with the money.
What did you do with it?

19:56.792 --> 19:59.750
Buck, we know
you wished Jerry ill.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.750
And that you and
Gina
go way back.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.500
Let him call a lawyer.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.375
I don't want a
lawyer.
I can't afford one.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.208
Fine, I'll make sure
you get a PD.

20:11.291 --> 20:12.834
If you're lucky,
you might even get a good one.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.875
You think a public
defender's
gonna care about me?

20:14.959 --> 20:16.792
Alright, maybe not, but Buck,
if you're not gonna talk

20:16.875 --> 20:18.458
about the money,
what are we supposed to do?

20:18.542 --> 20:22.166
Besides, if you're so
innocent,
what are you hedging for?

20:24.208 --> 20:26.542
Because I don't
want to hurt
her.

20:40.709 --> 20:42.000
Hey, Buck.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.291
What are you doing here?

20:43.375 --> 20:44.375
What are you doing here?

20:44.458 --> 20:46.250
I'm waiting for Jerry.

20:46.333 --> 20:47.959
He's running, too.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.959
So suddenly he's humping
early morning runs, huh?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.959
- Mm-hmm.
- Priceless.

20:53.041 --> 20:56.125
Well, Buck, here he
is.
So..

20:56.208 --> 20:59.500
Relax.
He ain't gonna see us. Look.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.709
'Got his head in the clouds.'

21:01.792 --> 21:03.125
What a clown.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.333
He could run these steps
like Rocky all day.

21:05.417 --> 21:06.500
It's gonna mean zip.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.625
No, he has been
working real hard.

21:17.625 --> 21:21.166
- Gina, the fix is in.
- What?

21:21.250 --> 21:23.875
Mo's taking a dive first
round.
Jerry's gonna win.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.000
It won't be a real fight?

21:31.125 --> 21:33.417
That'll hurt Jerry real bad.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.542
(Buck)
'Hey, there's nothing
you can do about it..'

21:35.625 --> 21:36.834
...except take advantage.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.041
What do you mean?

21:38.125 --> 21:39.959
You know what the odds
are of Jerry winning

21:40.041 --> 21:42.125
in a first round knockout?

21:42.208 --> 21:44.500
- What?
- Twenty to one.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.959
That's why I ain't busting
Balboa's bubble just yet.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.375
There's some real dough
to be made first.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.250
Gina couldn't resist
a sure thing.

22:19.917 --> 22:21.458
She was a gambler?

22:21.542 --> 22:24.542
I robbed that store so
I could get her betting
money.

22:24.625 --> 22:26.125
Did you tell her
how you got it?

22:26.208 --> 22:28.083
No, I wanted
to impress
her

22:28.166 --> 22:29.542
not tell her I was scum.

22:31.125 --> 22:32.625
Had it bad for her,
huh, Buck?

22:32.709 --> 22:35.417
My whole stupid life.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.583
So Gina acts
all broken up for Jerry

22:37.667 --> 22:39.208
that the fight's
gonna be a fake.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.500
But dries her eyes
pretty quick

22:41.583 --> 22:43.125
and places her
own bet on it.

22:53.458 --> 22:54.875
Hey, boss.

22:54.959 --> 22:57.750
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Scotty. Hey. Sure.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.458
What happened
in that interview

23:00.542 --> 23:03.375
was 100 percent
the wrong way.

23:03.458 --> 23:06.041
I mean, thumpin' on anybody
it doesn't matter who.

23:06.125 --> 23:07.291
You can't do it.

23:08.875 --> 23:09.959
Okay.

23:10.041 --> 23:12.125
I assure you

23:12.208 --> 23:14.333
it will not happen again.

23:14.417 --> 23:16.458
Well, that's good,
Scotty, 'cause it
can't.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.667
Anything else?

23:21.750 --> 23:23.625
I..

23:23.709 --> 23:25.834
Well, I was hoping
the, uh, suspension

23:25.917 --> 23:28.250
could be lifted...early.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.625
I didn't
suspend
you, Scotty.

23:29.709 --> 23:33.458
I encouraged you
to take time off.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.792
Well, I'd like you to
encourage me to come back.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.375
Well, how are you feeling?

23:39.458 --> 23:40.542
Great.

23:41.917 --> 23:43.166
Sorry, Scotty,
I can't do it.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.875
What do you mean? Why?

23:45.959 --> 23:47.917
I'll ask you again.
How're you feeling?

23:50.083 --> 23:52.417
I said fine.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.834
You're not ready yet.

23:53.917 --> 23:56.917
- Boss--
feel,

24:08.583 --> 24:10.709
Not..
Not that good.

24:13.125 --> 24:16.750
Hey.
Come next week.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.709
We'll get you
back on the
job.

24:27.959 --> 24:31.041
Thought Jerry was the
big love of your life, Gina.

24:31.125 --> 24:32.083
He was.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.667
So, why let him
go ahead with a fight

24:33.750 --> 24:35.834
you knew was rigged?

24:35.917 --> 24:39.041
Because you had money
on that fight.

24:39.125 --> 24:40.667
Yeah, I did.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.041
You took the
dough from Buck

24:42.125 --> 24:44.375
and the 20-to-one
odds
that came with it.

24:44.458 --> 24:46.667
Thirty-to-one by the time
I placed my bet.

24:46.750 --> 24:49.917
Hmm, couldn't resist it, huh?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.041
I have a bit
of a problem.

24:52.125 --> 24:55.000
So, all that talk
about Jerry's big heart

24:55.083 --> 24:58.458
and how there was no
stopping him...just words?

24:58.542 --> 25:00.250
No.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.625
But why should
all the other shlubs

25:01.709 --> 25:03.625
make money off of Jerry,
and not us?

25:03.709 --> 25:05.250
So you did it
for the both of
you?

25:05.333 --> 25:07.417
- Yeah.
- Why are we gonna believe you?

25:07.500 --> 25:10.375
Because I did tell Jerry,
and it cost me.

25:12.667 --> 25:16.125
- Nervous about tomorrow?
- No.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.417
No?

25:18.500 --> 25:21.000
Well, not like tonight.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.709
What's so big
about tonight?

25:43.500 --> 25:44.750
What do you say?

25:49.542 --> 25:51.000
Jerry.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.750
Mo's gonna fall down
in the first round.

25:59.875 --> 26:02.041
You're gonna win.

26:02.125 --> 26:05.208
What? Are you
jokin' me or not?

26:05.291 --> 26:07.750
Mm-mm.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.125
We're gonna
make some money.

26:15.959 --> 26:17.875
Are you saying
you put a bet down?

26:17.959 --> 26:21.542
Baby, just go
along with it.

26:21.625 --> 26:24.125
There's nothing
that you can do.

26:24.208 --> 26:28.959
- It's all set, huh?
- Jerry, this is our chance.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.667
We can get out of
this stinking
neighborhood.

26:30.750 --> 26:33.166
What, by being a bum?

26:33.250 --> 26:36.125
That's exactly what
I'm trying not to be.

26:36.208 --> 26:38.000
I thought you believed
in what I was doing.

26:38.083 --> 26:40.792
Jerry...we're stuck.

26:40.875 --> 26:44.208
And when we are 50,
we will still be stuck.

26:44.291 --> 26:46.083
We're not gonna get a
break like this again.

26:46.166 --> 26:48.083
We'll make our own breaks.

26:50.417 --> 26:51.375
You really believe that?

26:51.458 --> 26:54.041
That's why I want
this fight.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.917
To prove it.

27:12.959 --> 27:16.417
I guess I should
take that back.

27:24.125 --> 27:27.542
Well, we see it all
so different now.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.250
Hmm, short engagement.

27:40.417 --> 27:41.709
To make matters worse,
then I had to go

27:41.792 --> 27:43.625
tell Frank Shavers
what I'd done.

27:43.709 --> 27:46.041
- Who's Shavers?
- From the old neighborhood.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.709
I worked in his bingo parlor.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.583
If anyone had a bet
on this fix, it was him.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.458
So you told him
Jerry knew about it?

27:52.542 --> 27:55.750
And to take his bet back
before it was too late.

27:55.834 --> 27:57.250
And what'd he say?

27:57.333 --> 27:59.709
There is no taking bets back.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.667
(Will)
'So, Frank, you bet
big money on this fix'

28:07.750 --> 28:10.208
then Gina opens up
her mouth to Jerry.

28:10.291 --> 28:12.166
And I wasn't pleased.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.792
So, did you retaliate?

28:13.875 --> 28:15.083
How would I have done that?

28:15.166 --> 28:17.500
How about paying the
referee 1500 bucks

28:17.583 --> 28:18.750
to not stop the fight?

28:18.834 --> 28:20.834
No matter how bad
off Jerry was.

28:20.917 --> 28:22.333
Gettin' me what?

28:22.417 --> 28:24.750
Jerry ends up
maimed or dead

28:24.834 --> 28:27.208
the boxing world
gets the message.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.208
"Don't mess
with Frank Shavers."

28:29.291 --> 28:31.709
[chuckles]
Look, I'm not a
thug.

28:31.792 --> 28:33.375
I'm a businessman.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.333
And it was a bad
day at the office.

28:35.417 --> 28:37.291
So, you never
tampered with Sonny?

28:37.375 --> 28:39.959
I never suspected
anyone had.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.458
Until now.

28:42.709 --> 28:44.250
We're listening.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.792
Jerry lasted 15 rounds.

28:46.875 --> 28:49.083
That's incredible, really.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.875
But what's more
incredible is

28:50.959 --> 28:54.458
only one person bet
on Jerry to do just that.

28:57.375 --> 28:59.291
There you go, Frank.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.875
It finally hit you, huh?

29:10.959 --> 29:13.667
What's that?

29:13.750 --> 29:15.208
Three years from
now Mo Bell may be

29:15.291 --> 29:18.375
Heavyweight Champion
of the World.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.500
That's what
you're tangling
with.

29:29.583 --> 29:33.625
There's no shame in
knowing when to walk
away.

29:35.625 --> 29:36.917
No?

29:37.000 --> 29:39.500
It's the same
in respect to
Gina.

29:39.583 --> 29:41.834
'Return the ring, Jerry.'

29:41.917 --> 29:43.500
Let my daughter be.

29:46.917 --> 29:49.208
Drinking the night
before a fight.

29:50.542 --> 29:51.875
Put it down.

29:59.709 --> 30:02.500
Every reflex has to be right,
your mind clear.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.375
Father, it don't
matter anymore.

30:04.458 --> 30:05.417
What, are you freezing up?

30:05.500 --> 30:08.125
- No.
- Well, then fight.

30:08.208 --> 30:09.250
Then you'll
have tomorrow night

30:09.333 --> 30:10.834
for the rest of your life.

30:13.709 --> 30:15.250
You really think
I can do it,
Father?

30:15.333 --> 30:17.959
Son, I got money on you.

30:18.792 --> 30:20.917
You, too, Father?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.208
You bet on the fight?

30:22.291 --> 30:25.959
Now I need you
in that ring.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.250
- Father.
- Son.

30:27.333 --> 30:30.875
I've raised you from a pup.

30:30.959 --> 30:35.875
If you won't do this
for yourself, do it for me.

30:41.834 --> 30:44.250
So, Father needs Jerry
to go the distance.

30:44.333 --> 30:47.125
But that night,
he sees Jerry's
wobbly.

30:47.208 --> 30:49.375
And I didn't stick
around, but..

30:49.458 --> 30:53.208
the Father was huddled up
with Sonny when I left.

30:53.291 --> 30:55.959
Maybe Father bought
some insurance from
him.

30:56.041 --> 30:58.417
Made sure his pup got
to the finish line.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.041
Putting money
on Jerry not to win

31:06.125 --> 31:08.083
but to make
it 15 rounds.

31:08.166 --> 31:09.959
That's a pretty
specific bet, Father.

31:10.041 --> 31:12.083
That's because Jerry
set that goal for
himself.

31:12.166 --> 31:13.417
I thought he would make it.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.375
And your winnings
must have been sweet.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.667
I threw in the
towel,
for Pete's sake.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.208
Yeah, with 20 seconds
remaining.

31:20.291 --> 31:21.625
Because of what
I saw in his
eyes.

31:21.709 --> 31:23.500
Jerry always looked
bad,
but this time

31:23.583 --> 31:24.959
I could see
he was cooked.

31:25.041 --> 31:27.000
Or maybe throwing that towel

31:27.083 --> 31:29.625
was just an act,
huh, Father?

31:29.709 --> 31:32.834
Look, I can't force
you two to believe
me.

31:34.583 --> 31:36.458
Did you know
the fight was fixed?

31:36.542 --> 31:37.709
Fixed?

31:37.792 --> 31:39.208
Mo made a deal
to let Jerry win

31:39.291 --> 31:42.458
in the first round,
and Jerry knew about it.

31:42.542 --> 31:43.542
No kidding?

31:43.625 --> 31:45.959
But didn't wanna
go along with it.

31:46.041 --> 31:48.625
I wouldn't
think
he would.

31:48.709 --> 31:50.458
And if so,
that explains
why--

31:50.542 --> 31:51.709
Why what?

31:51.792 --> 31:53.291
That's why Round One.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.625
He's been standing
around for two
minutes.

32:09.709 --> 32:10.792
What the hell is
going on out
there?

32:10.875 --> 32:14.000
Come on.
Come on, hit me.

32:14.083 --> 32:16.166
- Come on.
- Oh, wonderful, the boo
birds.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.083
- Boo.
- Boo.

32:18.166 --> 32:20.333
- 'Come on, throw a punch.'
- Come on.

32:20.417 --> 32:22.166
Show me something, chump.
Come on.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.166
No way, Mo.

32:23.250 --> 32:27.458
Throw a punch.
Come on. Come on.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.500
- What's the matter?
- Stop it now.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.500
You gotta fight me now, Mo.

32:34.375 --> 32:36.125
- What are you doing?
- Give me water.

32:36.208 --> 32:38.583
What, is your mind mush?

32:38.667 --> 32:42.458
You want water? I'll give you
your damn water, huh?

32:42.542 --> 32:44.291
You got the rest of your life
to make eyes at that girl.

32:44.375 --> 32:46.583
- That's not happening.
- What are you talking about?

32:46.667 --> 32:48.166
I took the ring back.

32:48.250 --> 32:49.834
Alright, alright.
Come here.

32:51.208 --> 32:52.500
Get up.
You, wake up, okay?

32:52.583 --> 32:54.333
You get it on with this guy.
Get in there.

32:54.417 --> 32:55.834
Now you want a fight,
huh, Father?

32:55.917 --> 32:58.208
Well take a look,
'cause we got one.

32:58.291 --> 33:00.041
You're dead, you hear?
Dead.

33:06.333 --> 33:08.125
(Will)
'So the entire first round'

33:08.208 --> 33:09.458
Jerry never threw a punch.

33:09.542 --> 33:13.041
Making it impossible
for Mo to fake a knockout.

33:13.125 --> 33:16.625
I told Jerry I put
some money on him,
but..

33:16.709 --> 33:19.166
He must have thought
I'd taken this other
bet.

33:19.250 --> 33:20.750
The fix.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.250
That poor kid.

33:26.625 --> 33:27.917
At the end, he
must
have thought that

33:28.000 --> 33:29.834
even I didn't believe in him.

33:40.250 --> 33:41.792
Hey.

33:41.875 --> 33:44.041
Hey, my man.

33:44.125 --> 33:45.417
Where you been?

33:45.500 --> 33:47.875
Ah, per usual, long day.

33:47.959 --> 33:51.166
Oh, you're here now
and we're celebrating.

33:51.250 --> 33:54.250
We got a cause
or are we better
without?

33:54.333 --> 33:56.083
I'm back on
the job next week.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.792
No
kiddin'.
Yeah.

33:57.875 --> 33:59.208
- Way to go.
- That's good, right?

33:59.291 --> 34:02.125
Tops.
Tops, brother,
tops.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.291
What?

34:05.375 --> 34:06.667
Just that simple?

34:06.750 --> 34:09.250
It'd be simpler if I
can get
rollin' here a little
bit.

34:10.875 --> 34:12.333
Yo, Christina.

34:14.458 --> 34:17.375
I'll go again.
Get Nicky, too.

34:17.458 --> 34:18.792
How you doin'?

34:18.875 --> 34:20.709
Good, I didn't
know
you worked here.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.125
Yeah, it's fun for now.

34:23.208 --> 34:24.792
Although I find
some of the guys

34:24.875 --> 34:26.458
who come in here
are sort of..

34:26.542 --> 34:28.083
...half-ass.

34:28.166 --> 34:29.291
No kiddin'?

34:29.375 --> 34:31.000
Half-ass, huh?

34:31.083 --> 34:34.083
Uh, but that was
before
you two came in.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.250
Perfect.

34:37.333 --> 34:40.250
I got it.

34:40.333 --> 34:41.500
Thank you, kind sir.

34:48.917 --> 34:51.500
You know, taking it
back a sec

34:51.583 --> 34:54.458
you were telling me
you're happy I'm back

34:54.542 --> 34:58.000
not asking how I'm doing.

34:58.083 --> 34:59.625
Thanks for that.

35:02.375 --> 35:04.500
When the hard stuff happens

35:04.583 --> 35:07.458
I say walk it off
any way you can,
whatever.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.166
You're the goods, Nicky.

35:13.208 --> 35:16.750
But what you can't do..

35:16.834 --> 35:18.000
...is Rush's sister.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.291
You know what I mean?

35:21.625 --> 35:24.500
What do you think?
What are you talking about?

35:24.583 --> 35:27.792
Scotty, serious.

35:27.875 --> 35:30.917
Anyone but that, right?

35:55.917 --> 35:58.834
Mo said Jerry kept
yelling
he took the ring back

35:58.917 --> 36:01.625
thinking he was talking
about the boxing ring.

36:01.709 --> 36:03.000
But now we think Jerry meant

36:03.083 --> 36:05.417
the engagement ring
he bought for Gina.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.000
From Jimmy the jeweler.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.041
Jimmy's still in business?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.208
Well, on the day
of the fight

36:09.291 --> 36:10.542
Jerry took the ring in

36:10.625 --> 36:11.917
and asked for his money back.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.291
How much was it worth?

36:13.375 --> 36:14.417
Eighteen hundred.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.667
But Jimmy wouldn't
give him that.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.208
Said the ring
had depreciated

36:17.291 --> 36:18.667
over the three days
he had had it.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.458
So, what did Jerry
get for it?

36:20.542 --> 36:22.917
Fifteen hundred, even.

36:30.625 --> 36:32.792
So, we know
who paid off Sonny, Mo.

36:32.875 --> 36:34.250
Oh, yeah?

36:34.333 --> 36:36.083
Yeah. Jerry.

36:39.166 --> 36:41.792
Now, how does
that make sense?

36:41.875 --> 36:44.000
Jerry knew you'd open up
his face bad.

36:44.083 --> 36:45.792
And the way he bleeds,
he figures

36:45.875 --> 36:47.709
the ref will T-K-O him.

36:47.792 --> 36:50.417
It did pour
out,
sure enough.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.542
He wanted to prove he could
go
the whole 15 with you.

36:55.583 --> 36:57.750
Yeah, that
sounds
like old Jerry.

36:57.834 --> 36:59.250
Mo, could some of
the things he was saying

36:59.333 --> 37:03.000
during the fight have been
meant for Sonny and not you?

37:03.083 --> 37:06.125
Yeah, it didn't make
sense comin' my way.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.458
'And I'll tell
you what else.'

37:07.542 --> 37:09.125
I never seen a guy change

37:09.208 --> 37:11.166
so much over
the course of a
fight.

37:11.250 --> 37:14.625
- You mean Jerry?
- No, man, Sonny.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.625
Before the fight,
he hadn't an ounce of
respect

37:16.709 --> 37:17.709
for that Jerry.

37:17.792 --> 37:19.250
But by the end?

37:19.333 --> 37:21.625
Brother had
tears
in his eyes.

37:35.917 --> 37:37.041
Get over there.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.041
Jerry, I gotta call it.

37:42.125 --> 37:44.333
No, you can't.

37:45.083 --> 37:46.291
A deal is a deal.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.166
(male #1)
'Attaboy, Jerry. Attaboy.
Come on now.'

37:57.250 --> 37:59.166
'You're my great white hope,
attaboy.'

38:06.583 --> 38:08.000
Break, break, break.

38:08.083 --> 38:09.083
I gotta call it, Jerry.

38:09.166 --> 38:10.667
I did like you wanted.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.375
Please don't
take
from me this.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.583
Please..

38:30.083 --> 38:33.250
That's it. That's it.
Stop it. No more.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.417
- I took the ring back.
- No more, Jerry.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.917
- I took the ring back.
- You gotta stop. Please.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.375
'A deal's a deal.
I took the ring back.'

38:43.625 --> 38:45.375
Let's go.

39:02.417 --> 39:04.583
Hang on, kid.
Hang on, kid.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.875
Ten seconds.

39:08.875 --> 39:10.375
Hang on, Jerry.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.000
That's it. That's it.

39:26.667 --> 39:28.583
- My son..
- I'm not a bum.

39:28.667 --> 39:29.875
I know, Jerry.

39:29.959 --> 39:32.458
- I'm not a bum.
- Hell no, kid.

39:35.917 --> 39:37.417
Doctor.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.750
'Call the Doctor.'
