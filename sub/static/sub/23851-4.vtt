00:04.880 --> 00:06.200
Hey.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.400
Hi.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.074

00:19.000 --> 00:20.480
I got you something.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.960
For your birthday.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.400
You remembered.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.240
Eighteen's a big deal.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.520
Open it.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.240
It was my mom's.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.120
You and me against the world.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.480
Me and you against the world.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.678
Today's your birthday.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.080
Yeah. 18.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.000
Feels like your tenth birthday
was yesterday.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.438
Remember, we froze Shelby's bra?

02:28.440 --> 02:29.880
Yeah.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.718
Hey.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.478
Why don't you come over tonight?

02:38.480 --> 02:39.958
A game of croquet?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.238
I would love to, Betty,

02:42.240 --> 02:46.240
but I just already told JD
I'd hang out with him, so...

02:48.200 --> 02:49.838
Maybe I can after?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.160
Like, eight?

02:52.120 --> 02:53.720
-It'll be...
-Just?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.520
It'll be fun.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.480
And yes, you can be blue.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.278
Come here!

03:12.280 --> 03:14.840
-Heather, what are you doing?
-Come on!

03:18.720 --> 03:20.198
Heather!

03:20.200 --> 03:24.598
Heather. You just broke up with me
in front of the whole school.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.838
You still remember that?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.358
Kurt.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.240
Come on,
that had nothing to do with you.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.558
I'm trying to imagine how
someone of your limited capacities

03:35.560 --> 03:37.360
might understand this.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.718
You know how in pre-Revolutionary France

03:42.720 --> 03:45.318
King Louis XIV decreed
that all title-bearing noblemen

03:45.320 --> 03:47.318
reside within
the palace walls of Versailles?

03:47.320 --> 03:48.838
Not as a means of governance,

03:48.840 --> 03:51.680
but to quash the rise
of any legitimate political rival?

03:57.240 --> 03:58.560
Look...

04:00.000 --> 04:02.880
Heather made me dump you, okay?

04:03.960 --> 04:05.520
But I didn't want to do it.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.878
I just had to do it to keep her happy.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.560
Babe, stop fighting it.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.318
So, are you going to be
mean to me again?

04:15.320 --> 04:16.998
Of course not.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.360
Now, come on.

04:19.279 --> 04:21.040
Give mama some Stevia.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.838
And where are you off to, young lady?

04:27.840 --> 04:31.558
Betty's.
She invited me over for croquet.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.678
Well, you just be careful out there.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.478
The teens are killing themselves
left and right these days.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.800
Honey, don't be such a helicopter mom.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.358
Veronica, you go
and have a good time with your friends.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.760
Thanks, Dad.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.958
Honey, she's fine.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.598
Veronica is fine.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.198
I guess I just worry.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.078
I mean...

04:58.080 --> 05:00.680
I wouldn't even know
what to serve at a funeral.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.360
What has gotten into you today?

05:04.680 --> 05:07.320
You'd obviously serve
your artichoke dip.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.958
What are you thinking?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.400
Like, right now?

05:32.240 --> 05:33.880
I was thinking about Heather.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.320
Heather M.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.880
Like, if there was more
I could have done.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.640
Or...

05:47.640 --> 05:49.840
If this is a part of some plan.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.040
Like, had I sent a text
at the right moment or something.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.480
Would that have even made a difference?

06:00.080 --> 06:03.598
But then, if there is some grand plan...

06:03.600 --> 06:06.278
If all this is just...

06:06.280 --> 06:08.440
is just gonna happen anyway...

06:12.600 --> 06:14.200
then why do anything?

06:15.320 --> 06:17.280
There is no plan, Veronica.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.080
No control.

06:21.320 --> 06:26.798
No man in a long white beard playing
chess with people's stupid lives.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.038
No grand guru sending messages
from the great beyond

06:30.040 --> 06:32.878
for us to print up on yoga pants.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.400
That's all for them.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.240
Well, then, what's for us?

06:39.160 --> 06:40.600
Chaos.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.880
Here.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.438
You be the eyes, I'll be the hands.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.918
You tell me when to turn.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.518
No, okay, JD,
you gotta look at the road.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.320
Hey.
I trust you.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.840
All right.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.518
Curve up ahead.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.918
Veer left when I tell you.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.240
Now.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.478
Okay.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.920
Go right... now.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.680
I trust you.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.600
Faster.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.360
Stop sign.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.760
<i>Hey, you've reached Veronica.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

09:07.240 --> 09:11.878
I guess my goal is to be
the new face of suicide.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.358
After my own suicide attempt,

09:13.360 --> 09:15.878
I first thought the best way
to reach people was through the theater,

09:15.880 --> 09:18.838
but that was too limited for me.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.998
I mean, take Mr. Dennis' play,
for example.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.638
I can't remember the name of it.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.078
How many people are going to see that?

09:26.080 --> 09:28.838
Two hundred? 300 max?

09:28.840 --> 09:32.798
My "I Am Suicide" campaign
is going to be the entire school.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.118
And then... global.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.518
You're incredible.
Can I get a picture?

09:38.520 --> 09:39.960
Of course!

12:00.840 --> 12:02.918
Dear Heavenly Father,

12:02.920 --> 12:05.320
this is for our brother, Ram.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.120
By giving us the strength
to kick Washington High's ass!

12:50.120 --> 12:52.278
Briana Parker.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.398
Was this girl popular too?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.878
Trailer Parker?

12:55.880 --> 12:58.238
Oh, God, no. She was poor.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.560
Here we are again.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.398
-Another tragedy.
-Thank you, Pauline.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.758
That was the most important game
of the season.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.198
Tragedy? She was only paralyzed
from the waist down!

13:09.200 --> 13:13.798
Maurice, I wonder if your play
promoting suicide is to blame.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.198
Excuse me, but my art
has never killed anyone.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.678
Wait, actually...

13:18.680 --> 13:22.358
So, once again, the solution is...

13:22.360 --> 13:23.838
we do nothing.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.318
Don't you people see?

13:25.320 --> 13:28.518
Trailer Parker almost killing herself
is gonna be great for us.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.998
She was poor.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.600
Nobody's going to think
suicide's cool now.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.398
I mean... you're not wrong.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.078
Honestly, she should have
killed herself weeks ago.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.560
She could have saved Ram.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.440
What are you doing?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.160
Auditions were last week.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.238
Oh, my sliz.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.798
I raced to tell you as soon as I saw.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.358
It looks so lost-and-found
in this context.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.760
I think she looks just.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.320
My brand.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.880
That sewer priestess murdered my brand.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.120
Trailer.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.878
I'm confused.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.958
I'm trying to be a beacon
of hope for Westerburg,

14:38.960 --> 14:40.958
which is why it's confusing to me

14:40.960 --> 14:46.038
as to why you would try to kill yourself
wearing a home perm version of my merch.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.118
-I just wanted to--
-Yeah, we know what you wanted, Trailer.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.718
This is just another case of a poor girl

14:51.720 --> 14:55.078
trying to copy the rich kids
and failing miserably.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.400
Trailer.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.280
Transfer to Washington.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.000
Transfer to Jefferson.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.358
Because your future at Westerburg

15:05.360 --> 15:07.760
is as useless as your legs.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.960
Actually, Heather...

15:15.400 --> 15:17.718
I thought the whole point
of your "I Am Suicide" campaign

15:17.720 --> 15:19.800
was to help people like Trailer.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.158
Trailer is going through
so much right now,

15:23.160 --> 15:25.358
with her medical bills and depression,

15:25.360 --> 15:27.678
and all the hard water
deposit stains in her hair.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.798
I mean, you would think
you would be on her side.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.078
I guess you've been living
in your bubble for so long,

15:32.080 --> 15:35.038
you don't see
Trailer is the victim here.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.038
Actually, she's the victim
of people like you.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.838
Rich people.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.198
I mean, do you really think
we want to be poor?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.798
It is not our fault we're poor.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.080
Kind of like it's not your fault
you're overweight.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.158
Why are you doing this to me?

16:00.160 --> 16:03.200
I'm just calling out injustice
when I see it, like you taught me.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.238
Veronica.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.680
A word.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.000
I have to go to class, so...

16:25.680 --> 16:27.638
Veronica, we have a deal.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.638
Well, maybe I'm sick
of our deal, Heather.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.878
If I were you, I'd pray that my
"I Am Suicide" campaign works again,

16:33.880 --> 16:36.918
because if it doesn't, I'm going to
have to take a different approach.

16:36.920 --> 16:41.998
How does the innocent teenage girl
who survived a brutal murder attack

16:42.000 --> 16:46.398
by her best friend and the human
wallet chain she was dating sound?

16:46.400 --> 16:49.278
Not quite as sympathetic as the girl
who survived suicide, but...

16:49.280 --> 16:50.680
it'll do in a pinch.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.758
You know what, Heather?

16:55.760 --> 16:59.038
Go ahead.
Tell everyone.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.478
Who's going to believe you now?

17:01.480 --> 17:05.240
You just ride your suicide train
and then suddenly change your story?

17:06.560 --> 17:07.920
It's too late.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.079
You know what this is?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.238
Security footage from my house.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.160
The night I died.

17:26.599 --> 17:30.480
To paraphrase the late,
great Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes,

17:31.640 --> 17:33.960
don't go chasing waterfalls, Veronica.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.280
Stick to the swamps and the sewers
you're used to.

17:57.920 --> 18:02.078
I raised $3,000 for suicide awareness,
and how am I repaid?

18:02.080 --> 18:04.320
By being emotionally attacked by Lizzy!

18:08.480 --> 18:10.398
There, there, girl.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.318
What is happening?
Why are you touching me?

18:13.320 --> 18:15.318
Day in and day out,

18:15.320 --> 18:18.758
I have proven myself to be loyal to you.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.398
And yet, you continue
to waste your energy trying to crush me.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.038
Oh, Heather, that's cute.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.880
But crushing you literally
takes me no energy at all.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.680
Take a break.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.360
Let me help you.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.278
Let me be the one to take down Lizzy.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.798
Isn't that a little
outside your paygrade?

18:38.800 --> 18:41.198
I'll handle it myself,
like I have to do with everything.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.078
But the new Heather Chandler,

18:43.080 --> 18:45.198
she wants to help people.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.840
You can't take down Lizzy
without getting your hands dirty.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.680
I, on the other hand...

18:52.880 --> 18:54.478
Fine.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.118
But if you blow this one, girl,

18:56.120 --> 18:58.880
it'll be keggers with kids
for the rest of the year.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.038
<i>"Dear Diary, you have</i>
<i>to hand it to America.</i>

19:14.040 --> 19:16.758
<i>We can even take something</i>
<i>like teen suicide,</i>

19:16.760 --> 19:20.718
<i>wrap it in a pretty package,</i>
<i>and sell it to the highest bidder.</i>

19:20.720 --> 19:23.758
<i>God, I'm starting to sound like JD.</i>

19:23.760 --> 19:25.598
<i>But so what?</i>

19:25.600 --> 19:28.478
<i>He's the only one</i>
<i>who makes any sense anymore.</i>

19:28.480 --> 19:30.078
<i>And you know what?</i>

19:30.080 --> 19:33.398
<i>I don't care if what I'm about to say</i>
<i>is so high school,</i>

19:33.400 --> 19:35.120
<i>it makes you upchuck.</i>

19:36.120 --> 19:38.960
<i>Our love is the only thing left</i>
<i>that's real.</i>

19:40.040 --> 19:42.078
<i>You can't turn it into a poster</i>

19:42.080 --> 19:44.360
<i>or sell it to anyone</i>
<i>with 50 bucks to spend.</i>

19:45.400 --> 19:47.598
<i>Because it's ours.</i>

19:47.600 --> 19:50.880
<i>Everything else is just Photoshop."</i>

20:02.960 --> 20:04.560
Betty!

20:09.000 --> 20:10.920
I totally forgot about croquet.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.280
Maybe tonight?

20:47.760 --> 20:49.478
<i>"Dearest Lizzy, you know I love you.</i>

20:49.480 --> 20:51.838
<i>You ignore me, reject me.</i>
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

20:51.840 --> 20:55.038
<i>Meet me at Butcher's Bridge tonight,</i>
<i>or I'll kill myself.</i>

20:55.040 --> 20:56.800
<i>Yours, Ram."</i>

20:59.120 --> 21:00.598
Oh, Seth?

21:00.600 --> 21:04.118
I think Lizzy just got a shocking note
with a dramatic revelation in it.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.720
But I can't be sure.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.040
They're gonna tear her apart.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.518
-Don't you want to stay and watch?
-Stay and watch? Please, Heather.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.718
I own the casino.
I don't play the slots.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.798
Plus, I need to fix my makeup
before next period.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.120
Mirror!

21:37.920 --> 21:41.798
Did you hear? Ram killed himself
to fulfill a suicide ultimatum

21:41.800 --> 21:43.798
because of his
unrequited love for Lizzy.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.958
Imagine someone
killing themselves for you.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.440
Lizzy is so lucky.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.678
-What's weird is...
-What?

21:51.680 --> 21:55.198
This happened at my last school too.
I don't know.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.318
I guess it's just my cross to bear.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.118
Oh, you are so brave.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.840
He really loved you.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.318
"Or I'll kill myself"!

22:05.320 --> 22:08.120
-To have someone die for you.
-This is the note.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.320
Our hot and heavy notes
always bring people down.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.960
Heather?

22:28.960 --> 22:30.280
Heather!

22:37.520 --> 22:38.920
Heather!

22:41.000 --> 22:42.320
We're okay, right?

22:44.440 --> 22:45.800
Heather?

22:58.240 --> 23:00.080
Betty, have a seat.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.438
What is this?

23:08.440 --> 23:10.158
I can't do this. Not today!

23:10.160 --> 23:11.958
An A minus, Betty?

23:11.960 --> 23:13.558
She's going to end up poor.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.838
We didn't raise you
to be an A minus student.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.598
Poor and then a prostitute!

23:17.600 --> 23:19.838
Betty, how could you
let yourself slip like this?

23:19.840 --> 23:21.718
Who will end up dying alone in a ditch.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.398
You've always been so conscientious.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.118
My daughter, a dead ditch hooker!

23:26.120 --> 23:28.958
We think maybe you've been
hanging around some bad influences.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.958
-Veronica.
-We've never approved

23:30.960 --> 23:32.438
of the way she's treated you, Betty.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.278
Everyone who gets close to her dies.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.598
Your mother has a point.
Heather, Heather, Ram.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.318
Dead! Dead! Dead!

23:38.320 --> 23:40.718
Well now, honey, to be fair,
the first Heather did come back to life.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.078
She's cursed. I saw her
at the Snappy Snack Shack with a boy.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.038
-He could be the next to die.
-Or you.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.680
What if you're next, Betty?

23:58.840 --> 24:01.080
I keep one half for myself,

24:01.880 --> 24:04.958
and I give the other half
to my best friend.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.998
But which one of you should it be?

24:07.000 --> 24:10.118
Eeny meeny miney mo,
catch a tiger by the toe,

24:10.120 --> 24:11.678
if he hollers, let him go,

24:11.680 --> 24:14.000
eeny meeny miney mo.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.038
Let's play tag!

24:19.040 --> 24:22.198
Tag?
Tag is for little girls, Betty.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.758
Let's play croquet.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.318
It's my house.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.080
Let's vote. Who wants to play croquet?

24:30.360 --> 24:32.238
Sorry, Betty.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.840
Two against one.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.398
Betty?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.800
We need to talk.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.280
Everyone close to her
commits suicide, JD.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.400
I think she gets into people's heads.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.158
And then what happened
when we were younger.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.518
It all makes sense.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.238
She's manipulating people, JD.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.960
And... I think you may be next.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.438
You don't know what she's like
when no one's looking.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.400
She's threatened me, Betty.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.558
I haven't said anything,
because who's going to believe a guy

26:04.560 --> 26:07.318
who says he's scared
of his own girlfriend.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.280
But she's evil, Betty.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.518
I just don't know what to do.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.120
She's always been a bully.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.558
I think we should
tell someone at school.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.800
We can tell Principal Gowan tomorrow.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.838
There's more, Betty.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.198
She doesn't just put ideas
in people's heads.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.560
It's worse.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.318
-What is it, JD?
-No, no.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.920
She'll find out I showed you.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.640
Showed me what?

26:45.360 --> 26:46.760
Okay.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.680
But she can never know.

27:20.440 --> 27:23.998
Kurt! God, thank God you're here,
I had the worst day.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.278
Get over here and rub my shoulders
while I vent.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.840
Heather... how could you?

27:29.760 --> 27:31.278
I'm sorry. What?

27:31.280 --> 27:34.678
You turned my best friend's death
into a joke.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.598
What are you--

27:36.600 --> 27:39.278
That note that Ram wrote to Lizzy,
that wasn't me--

27:39.280 --> 27:40.758
You wrote it!

27:40.760 --> 27:42.358
-Yeah, but...
-Heather, stop!

27:42.360 --> 27:44.398
I know you think I'm dumb.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.158
Well, guess what, you're right.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.960
And you know what the proof is?

27:49.480 --> 27:51.000
I keep coming back.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.118
Kurt!

27:54.120 --> 27:57.558
You think you're so different
and edgy and interesting.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.798
Maybe here in Sherwood you are.
But guess what, Heather?

28:00.800 --> 28:02.838
Next year, you're going
to go to college in New York.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.838
And when you go to your dorm room,
you're gonna strut down that hallway

28:05.840 --> 28:09.118
and there's going to be
15 other people just like you.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.078
Except they won't be just like you.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.638
They'll be smarter than you,
more interesting than you,

28:13.640 --> 28:15.720
and much, much hotter than you.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.878
And then you'll realize
you're not special at all.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.358
After a couple years,

28:23.360 --> 28:26.318
you'll tell yourself some lie
about how New York isn't for you.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.918
And you'll move back,
which is where I'll see you

28:28.920 --> 28:31.080
selling makeup at our hometown mall.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.320
Are you reading off a note card?

28:39.720 --> 28:43.558
Fine, you got me, Heather told me
to say this stuff, but you know what?

28:43.560 --> 28:45.520
I didn't need Heather Chandler
to come up with this.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.398
With the way you treat people,

28:49.400 --> 28:51.798
you're going to end up alone.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.438
And honestly...

28:53.440 --> 28:54.960
that's what you deserve.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.400
Here.
She wanted me to give you this.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.080
Good-bye for real this time, Heather.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.200
Take the box!

29:35.720 --> 29:38.758
<i>"Congratulations, Heather.</i>
<i>You got what you wanted.</i>

29:38.760 --> 29:40.718
<i>You're back to second place.</i>

29:40.720 --> 29:42.358
<i>Hope it was worth it.</i>

29:42.360 --> 29:44.958
<i>Now get your ass back over here,</i>
<i>and bring me a slushy.</i>

29:44.960 --> 29:46.520
<i>Love, Heather."</i>

29:54.520 --> 29:56.080
It's just up here.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.520
Where Ram killed himself.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.040
Ram didn't kill himself, Betty.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.640
She brought me here.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.880
She walked me through all of it.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.040
It's like she was proud of herself.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.638
She was like a cat who caught a mouse

30:52.640 --> 30:55.078
and wanted to parade it around
in front of me.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.358
-We have to go to the police, JD!
-No one will believe us.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.998
Well there's got to be something,
some evidence.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.758
No.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.640
She's too smart, Betty.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.920
What?

31:34.920 --> 31:36.600
What are you doing, JD?

31:38.480 --> 31:40.000
What is...

31:41.280 --> 31:43.558
You're just as crazy as she is!

31:43.560 --> 31:45.038
No.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.958
Veronica's not crazy.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.360
But I certainly am.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.280
Little Betty Finn, putting up a fight.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.920
Ballet, six years.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.280
Gymnastics, 12 years.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.000
Martial arts, nine years.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.480
Don't make me chase after you, Betty.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.520
And four years of track and field.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.560
Mom! Dad! Help!

33:11.040 --> 33:12.520
College try, Betty.

33:36.360 --> 33:40.880
-Let me guess.
-Fencing, five years.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.598
The pent-up rage of an overachiever

33:53.600 --> 33:55.520
17 years.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.000
Seriously?

34:20.520 --> 34:22.719
Come on. Just do it.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.158
What are you doing?

34:28.159 --> 34:29.717
I'm doing what a normal person does

34:29.719 --> 34:32.199
when they're being attacked
by a psychopath.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.080
I'm calling the police, you asshole.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.438
You didn't text me back.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.918
Yeah, as you can see,
I got kind of sidetracked.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.958
What happened, JD?

35:13.960 --> 35:16.038
Betty came to me,
she said she was worried for me,

35:16.040 --> 35:17.638
she said everyone close to you dies,

35:17.640 --> 35:19.480
and then she said
she's going to the cops.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.918
What did you do?

35:22.920 --> 35:25.160
She's not dead,
if that's what you're thinking.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.398
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened, JD.

35:32.400 --> 35:36.038
Look, she came to my house,
she ambushed me,

35:36.040 --> 35:39.680
so I told her that I agreed with her,
and that I was scared of you.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.318
-And then what?
-And then I tried to get rid of her.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.478
-Where?
-At my house!

35:46.480 --> 35:50.238
But... she got away,
so I had to catch up with her.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.958
And what did you do
when you caught up with her?

35:51.960 --> 35:56.478
Look, Veronica,
obviously, it did not end well for me.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.518
The point is that Betty knows now.

35:59.520 --> 36:04.758
And Betty is going to go to the police,
so we have to do something.

36:04.760 --> 36:08.440
You have to promise me
you told me everything that happened.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.840
Babe... yes.

36:14.720 --> 36:20.440
Now, can we please
think of a way... to fix this?

36:22.960 --> 36:24.280
Fine.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.520
What are you doing?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.120
I'm giving you an alibi.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.958
<i>"Dear Diary,</i>

36:42.960 --> 36:45.280
<i>JD went too far this time.</i>

36:46.680 --> 36:49.120
<i>He showed his true colors tonight.</i>

37:00.920 --> 37:02.678
<i>And now...</i>

37:02.680 --> 37:04.800
<i>it's time I showed mine."</i>
