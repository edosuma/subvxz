00:49.583 --> 00:52.953
[music playing]

00:55.055 --> 00:55.956
Freeze!

00:56.056 --> 00:57.791
DJ, put that back in the box.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.792
I just packed it.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.394
This is my laser gun.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.295
I know.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.131
It fried my hair.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.998
If I shoot you, your
eyeballs will freeze

01:05.099 --> 01:07.301
and you will turn into a zombie.

01:07.401 --> 01:11.038
That's kind of like your
dad when he watches TV.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.440
I heard that.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.474
Blast her, DJ!

01:13.574 --> 01:14.375
Bang!

01:14.475 --> 01:16.377
[groans]

01:18.979 --> 01:22.483
Good shootin', Beldar!

01:22.583 --> 01:23.417
Thanks.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.719
Honey, where do
you want this box?

01:25.819 --> 01:27.521
Oh, God, even
when I'm dead you're

01:27.621 --> 01:30.424
asking me where stuff goes.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.093
PTA rummage sale
is gonna love me.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.263
Well, this house ought
to be their headquarters.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.198
Why you givin'
all this stuff away?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.832
We're not giving
all this stuff away.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.834
We're just giving the
crummy stuff away.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.903
Yeah, like, we ought
to fold you in half

01:43.003 --> 01:44.272
and stick you in a box.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.873
[bird sounds]

01:45.973 --> 01:46.774
Ow, ow.

01:46.874 --> 01:47.875
- Is Becky home yet?
- Not yet.

01:47.975 --> 01:48.776
I'm sorry!

01:48.876 --> 01:50.344
Ow, ow!

01:50.444 --> 01:54.282
One kid down,
two to go, darling.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.517
You guys are major dweebs.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.720
Oh, Thank you, honey,
that means so much to us.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.562
Get in that kitchen and
rustle me up some grub, woman.

02:08.662 --> 02:12.466
Oh, I love it when
you talk like a man.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.669
I can't believe you're
going to throw this away.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.637
I wasn't.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.472
I was just gonna
get it re-bristled.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.043
This was in my
to-be-fixed box.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.480
Oh, you mean your
talked-about-fixin' it box?

02:26.580 --> 02:29.483
Dear, I can only fix
one thing at a time,

02:29.583 --> 02:30.651
and I'm still working on you.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.359
Kiss it good bye, Dan,
I'm tired of all this junk

02:38.459 --> 02:39.793
cluttering up my house.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.199
Your house?

02:45.299 --> 02:48.936
She who cleans it keeps it.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.204
Oh yeah?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.839
Well a man's home is his castle.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.241
Well you ain't got
a castle and that's

02:53.341 --> 02:55.209
why you're staying at my place.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.547
Oh yeah?

02:59.647 --> 03:03.183
Yeah, let's face it, Dan,
you are a junk junkie--

03:03.284 --> 03:05.653
a hardcore pack rat.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.020
I am not.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.889
Yeah, you are.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.191
You're right, babe.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.927
I do keep too much stuff
cluttering up your house.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.664
What are you
gonna do about it?

03:16.764 --> 03:20.268
I'm gonna go cold
turkey starting right now.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.507
So long, old pal,
I'm gonna miss ya.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.443
Well, I'll leave
you two alone.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.378
You know what?

03:30.478 --> 03:31.779
I want you to go
up in your closet

03:31.879 --> 03:34.448
and throw out
everything that I hate.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.518
That ought to keep you
busy most of the day.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.354
Your every wish is my command.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.322
Really?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.056
Oh yeah, baby,
I love to serve.

03:43.156 --> 03:47.761
Well, now I like a
guy who knows his place.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.197
Hey, is that a toothbrush
in your pocket, or are

03:50.298 --> 03:51.432
you just happy to see me?

03:54.435 --> 03:55.235
Don't say a word.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.504
What?

03:56.604 --> 03:57.771
Just come upstairs.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.307
What'd you do?

03:59.407 --> 04:00.508
Just come on.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.942
Can I come?

04:02.042 --> 04:02.843
No.

04:02.943 --> 04:03.811
Where you going?

04:03.911 --> 04:04.812
Nowhere!

04:04.912 --> 04:05.779
What you doing?

04:05.879 --> 04:06.680
Nothing!

04:09.317 --> 04:11.952
What is your problem?

04:12.052 --> 04:14.288
Don't give Mom
your report card.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.290
OK, Darlene,
what did you flunk?

04:16.390 --> 04:19.126
I didn't flunk anything.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.395
All right, I got
a D in history.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.432
Mom said one D and I was
off the basketball team.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.133
That's why you can't show
her your report card.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.668
Hey, I got straight A's.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.604
Well that's your problem.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.506
Darlene, you can't take your
report card back to school

04:32.606 --> 04:33.607
until Mom signs it.

04:33.707 --> 04:34.975
She is going to sign it.

04:35.075 --> 04:38.379
But first, I'm gonna
change my D to a B.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.613
You can do that.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.648
Watch me.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.784
All I have to do is
match the red ink.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.218
You are nuts.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.387
Becky, you got to help me.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.421
No way.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.389
I'll give you my allowance.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.289
Forget it.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.258
For a month.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.726
Well, maybe.

04:52.826 --> 04:53.961
Great.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.195
But if mom catches
you, you'll be

04:55.295 --> 04:57.264
playing basketball on crutches.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.500
She's not going to catch me.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.569
OK, but I want my
money in advance.

05:04.137 --> 05:04.938
Mom!

05:05.038 --> 05:07.140
Son!

05:07.240 --> 05:09.042
Becky and Darlene
are up to something.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.011
Well, don't be
spying on your sisters.

05:11.111 --> 05:11.912
What are they up to?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.382
Something rotten.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.451
Well, it's up to you
007 to find out what.

05:17.551 --> 05:22.890
And you will, because your
name is Bond, James Bond.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.596
All right.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.197
What is this?

05:30.297 --> 05:31.499
Cardboard box.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.501
Yeah, but it's filled
with all this junk

05:33.601 --> 05:34.902
you stole from the other boxes.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.670
Honey, this stuff
isn't rummage.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.772
Well, Dan, now I
can't help you if you're

05:38.872 --> 05:39.973
not willing to help yourself.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.545
Hi, I'm Dan and
I'm a pack rat.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.217
Everything I've ever had
in my life I still have.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.419
And what is this?

05:51.519 --> 05:54.655
Oh, no house should be
without a plastic bowling

05:54.755 --> 05:57.558
ball on a pedestal.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.292
See, it's also a decanter.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.197
You're in worse
shape than I thought.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.799
Dan, all of this stuff is gone.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.334
No, no, please just
let me keep one thing.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.235
Just one thing.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.403
Please, please, please?

06:09.503 --> 06:10.504
All right, one thing.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.139
But not that thing.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.207
This is my official
Canoga beer cuckoo clock--

06:14.307 --> 06:15.509
it's a collector's item.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.445
Dan, it's got a bear
that comes out on the hour

06:17.545 --> 06:18.345
and burps.

06:21.114 --> 06:24.151
That's the Canoga bear and
he doesn't burp he growls.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.052
He burps.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.186
He growls.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.088
He pops out with a beer mug.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.923
The belching bear goes.

06:30.023 --> 06:30.824
You really hate him, huh?

06:30.924 --> 06:32.392
I despise it.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.462
Well, I'll tell you what--

06:34.562 --> 06:37.064
the clock goes if
everything else stays.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.737
Are you blackmailing me?

06:43.837 --> 06:45.305
You bet your booties.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.206
You're hopeless.

06:46.306 --> 06:49.510
[evil laughter]

06:51.545 --> 06:52.446
Hi, sis.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.413
Hello.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.915
Hi, Aunt Jackie.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.484
Hi, pumpkin butt.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.518
Hi.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.786
- Hello.
- Where do you want these?

06:58.886 --> 06:59.687
I'll take it.

06:59.787 --> 07:00.588
OK.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.856
Roseanne, look, look at this.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.859
I don't even remember
buying this thing.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.895
I do, you got it
the same time you

07:07.995 --> 07:10.731
got that hissing viper tattoo.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.733
You got a tattoo?

07:12.833 --> 07:13.701
Well, maybe.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.968
Can I see it?

07:15.068 --> 07:16.336
You're too young.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.370
Can I see it?

07:17.471 --> 07:20.440
You're too old.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.142
Hey, kiddo, you gonna
stick around and mooch

07:22.242 --> 07:23.143
dinner from us tonight?

07:23.243 --> 07:24.545
No, I have a date.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.013
Animal, vegetable, or mineral?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.147
Booker.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.516
Vegetable.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.551
We're going to the
Pinewood dinner theater.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.053
Booker got tickets to see
this great Elvis impersonator.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.321
Well, now, what
would you want to go

07:34.421 --> 07:36.256
see an impersonator for
when the real thing is

07:36.356 --> 07:37.357
out there somewhere?

07:37.457 --> 07:38.926
Roseanne, don't start.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.761
They spotted Elvis
just yesterday.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.062
He was in Montana.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.666
He's trying to call up
Ann-Margret from a pay phone.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.634
Hey!

07:46.734 --> 07:49.603
Hey, hey, don't make
fun of the King.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.572
Come on, 'Cilla, fire up
the Cadillac and let's

07:51.672 --> 07:56.510
go to Denver for some peanut
butter and bacon sandwiches.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.913
I can't go with you, Elvis, I
have to go get my hair teased.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.215
(SINGING) Well
since my baby let me,

08:02.315 --> 08:04.351
I found a new place to dwell.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.320
[screaming]

08:07.420 --> 08:10.290
(SINGING) --Heartbreak hotel.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.760
I've been so lonely, baby.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.261
I've been so lonely.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.229
[screaming]

08:16.329 --> 08:17.731
Goodnight, ladies
and gentlemen.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.799
Thank you very much.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.200
Elvis is leaving the auditorium.
Thank you.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.669
Thank you very much.
I'm leaving the auditorium.

08:21.769 --> 08:22.570
Thank you.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.171
Thank you very much.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.774
There's no way you're going
to get away with this, Darlene.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.075
Look, basketball
is almost over.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.344
All I have to do is fool
Mom for two more weeks.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.546
Shoot!

08:32.646 --> 08:33.446
What's wrong?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.148
I can't match this red ink.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.450
Crane probably drains the
blood out of stray cats

08:37.551 --> 08:40.520
to get her ink.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.454
Shh.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.322
What?

08:42.422 --> 08:43.724
I hear something.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.158
You're just paranoid.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.627
No, be quiet.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.402
You're dead, DJ!

08:55.502 --> 08:56.870
Mom!

08:56.970 --> 08:59.773
Now Mom is gonna come up here.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.609
No kidding, zit brain.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.778
It's just pens.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.013
I'm giving Mom my report card.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.014
No, you can't.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.982
Hey, I'm not the
one who got the D.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.751
Why should I get in
trouble for one month

09:10.851 --> 09:12.352
of your stinkin' allowance?

09:12.452 --> 09:13.253
Did I say one month?

09:13.353 --> 09:14.154
I meant five.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.823
Deal.

09:15.923 --> 09:16.724
Becky!

09:16.824 --> 09:17.625
Darlene!

09:17.725 --> 09:18.692
Oh my gosh, she knows.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.893
No she doesn't.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.929
She's gonna want to know
why we locked the door.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.396
Come on, you
two, open the door.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.332
Don't make me get the tear gas.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.203
Hi!

09:30.303 --> 09:31.171
Hi!

09:31.271 --> 09:32.339
Hi.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.206
Hi.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.043
Why'd you lock the door?

09:36.143 --> 09:37.510
Well, you know, I'm
so used to locking

09:37.611 --> 09:40.413
my locker at school I guess
I just did it automatically.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.150
I don't know, what
do you think, DJ?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.652
Lies, all lies.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.090
DJ told you to come
up here, didn't he?

09:50.190 --> 09:51.792
No, as a matter of
fact he didn't say

09:51.892 --> 09:54.027
one thing about how you
jerked the door open

09:54.127 --> 09:55.829
and yelled at him, did you, DJ?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.731
Nope.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.166
Now, I brought you
girls up this box

09:59.266 --> 10:01.168
so you could fill it with
stuff for the rummage sale.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.235
Glad to.

10:02.335 --> 10:05.172
We'll bring it right down.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.974
DJ, quit snooping!

10:07.074 --> 10:09.109
Mom, I think Dad
is calling you.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.310
She's up here!

10:10.410 --> 10:13.681
Yeah, she'll be right down!

10:13.781 --> 10:15.382
Well, he can wait.

10:15.482 --> 10:18.185
You know, I don't think I
really spend enough time

10:18.285 --> 10:21.088
with my lovely daughters--

10:21.188 --> 10:24.892
enjoying their extremely
stimulating company,

10:24.992 --> 10:27.160
you know, just hanging out
and everything like that.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.062
Doing really fun stuff and--

10:29.162 --> 10:33.466
Mother, get a life.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.936
[singing]

10:38.005 --> 10:42.910
(SINGING) It's been too long
long, long, baby, come back.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.478
I been so lonely, baby.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.048
I've been so lonely.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.482
I've been so lonely--

10:49.582 --> 10:52.652
Hey, the girls
are up to something.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.054
They got their door
locked and they're

10:54.154 --> 10:55.856
acting all goofy, like you.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.525
What are you doing?

10:58.625 --> 11:00.360
I'm just fixin'
this here clock, mama.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.762
I'll have it done
within the hour.

11:06.700 --> 11:13.540
Scum sucking, self-centered,
pile of male garbage!

11:13.640 --> 11:15.542
Dan, it's for you.

11:15.642 --> 11:18.846
[music playing]

11:22.249 --> 11:26.019
I buy new panty
hose, I moose my hair,

11:26.119 --> 11:27.988
I sit in my apartment
for an hour and a half,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.723
and Booker doesn't show up.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.392
Well, maybe he had some
kind of an emergency.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.094
Yeah, I know his emergencies.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.030
Blond hair, blue eyes, and
legs up to their throat.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.166
So maybe he's giving
them mouth to mouth.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.533
What are ya doing?

11:40.633 --> 11:43.003
Have you seen that red
pen that was in here?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.905
Yeah, I thought I saw it
on the coffee table before.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.974
Why does he do this me?

11:47.074 --> 11:47.875
I'll get it.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.376
I'll get it.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.244
Oh, you love it.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.546
Oh, your pulse is racing,
your heart is throbbing,

11:53.646 --> 11:55.282
your face is all aglow.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.450
I have malaria.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.420
Aunt Jackie,
it's Uncle Booker.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.122
I'm not here.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.656
Jackie, I can explain.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.758
I don't want to hear about it.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.193
I-- I had an emergency.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.095
Blond hair, blue eyes?

12:08.195 --> 12:12.099
I was on the phone
with my mother.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.867
I was.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.069
Jeez, Booker, you ought
to take a shovel around

12:16.169 --> 12:18.371
with you when you travel.

12:18.471 --> 12:22.009
Her schnauzer got hit by
a car, he broke his leg.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.544
Oh, get off it.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.779
I'm not lying.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.081
The dog's got a broken leg,
my mom was in hysterics,

12:28.181 --> 12:29.549
what was I supposed to do?

12:29.649 --> 12:30.884
Hang up.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.619
Booker, I'm on
your side, buddy,

12:32.719 --> 12:35.088
and even I don't believe you.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.157
OK, call my Mom and ask her.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.226
Roseanne, did you have
some rummage you wanted

12:39.326 --> 12:41.594
me to fold in another room?

12:41.694 --> 12:43.196
Yes, I believe I do.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.798
Why don't we go
there now, you and I.

12:44.898 --> 12:45.698
Come on, Jackie.

12:45.799 --> 12:46.599
Forget it.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.541
She's not mad.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.910
Could have fooled me.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.046
No, if she was mad
she would have left.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.681
No, she just-- she's waiting
for me to come back there.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.016
Yeah, well, if
I was you I'd wait

13:03.116 --> 13:05.152
for the smoke to clear before
I went charging in there.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.720
That's a good idea.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.456
What you got, Dan?

13:09.556 --> 13:12.159
My official Canoga
beer cuckoo clock.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.660
Ugly as hell, ain't it?

13:13.760 --> 13:14.761
It is pretty ugly.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.363
I just keep it around
to torture Roseanne.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.301
Oh, how long are you
gonna put up with him?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.602
I can't help it.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.004
He turns me on.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.940
One of these days you're gonna
fall for a guy with something

13:27.040 --> 13:29.109
above the waist.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.744
Well, just cause you're
stuck in marriage hell

13:31.845 --> 13:35.115
you don't have to ruin my fun.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.651
Well, you know, there's more
to a relationship than sex.

13:38.751 --> 13:39.619
You and Dan are fighting?

13:42.589 --> 13:44.457
I, uh, can I come in now?

13:44.557 --> 13:46.459
Yeah, but you
stay off of my bed.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.900
You gonna stay
mad at me all night?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.067
Maybe.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.069
Come on, Jackie, if I
was going to lie don't you

13:56.169 --> 13:57.938
think I'd come up
with a better excuse.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.874
Booker, why do you
screw up all of our dates?

14:00.974 --> 14:01.975
Dates?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.610
This is the first time
we've ever gone out.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.813
Right, and it's
our fourth date.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.249
Jackie, come on, what do--
you want to go out with some guy

14:09.349 --> 14:11.084
who-- who hangs up on his mom?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.386
No, but I want to go out
with a guy that shows up.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.487
I went all out for this.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.388
I got a new dress.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.959
I spent an hour on my hair.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.693
You did all that for me?

14:20.793 --> 14:23.931
No, I did it so I could fold
clothes in my sister's bedroom.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.701
Jackie, I'm flattered.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.137
I don't want you
to feel flattered.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.772
I want you to feel
lousy like I feel.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.176
Jackie, you don't look lousy.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.344
No, no, no, no.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.012
This dress looks very nice.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.113
Stay away from me.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.215
Did I mention that
your hair is terrific.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.183
Stay away.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.217
Booker, sit.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.419
Sit.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.421
Don't touch me.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.656
Touch.

14:49.756 --> 14:50.890
Don't touch me.

14:50.991 --> 14:51.791
Touch, touch.

14:51.891 --> 14:52.792
Booker I--

14:52.892 --> 14:57.797
I mean-- I hate you.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.670
Ew, they're kissing!

15:03.770 --> 15:04.671
They're kissing!

15:08.775 --> 15:09.576
They're kissing!

15:09.676 --> 15:11.478
They're kissing!
- Who?

15:11.578 --> 15:12.980
Aunt Jackie and Booker.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.447
Are they standing up?

15:14.547 --> 15:16.383
Yes, we're standing up.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.452
And we're leaving now to
get started on our date.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.188
Yeah, we're a little
too late to see Elvis.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.089
That's putting it mildly.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.128
- See you, Dan.
- Where you guys headed?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.163
We're going out for
a romantic evening.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.133
And an insanely
expensive meal.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.934
I just got to pick
up my date first.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.269
Wipe your mouth off.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.570
Bye, Aunt Jackie.

15:37.670 --> 15:38.471
Bye.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.040
Time for you to go to bed now.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.274
G'night.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.175
OK.

15:45.912 --> 15:46.713
Good night.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.015
[groans]

15:48.115 --> 15:49.082
[stomping up stairs]

15:49.182 --> 15:50.817
Mom, you need to
sign our report cards.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.919
You got your
report cards today?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.687
Yeah, here, sign it.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.090
Well, I usually like
to read what I'm signing.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.425
How did you do, Darlene?

15:58.525 --> 16:00.227
Pretty good.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.128
Pretty good?

16:01.228 --> 16:04.197
She got a B in history.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.866
I thought you were
going to get a D.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.935
It's a miracle.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.038
Aren't you going
to look at mine?

16:11.138 --> 16:12.205
I got straight A's.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.573
Oh, that's great honey.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.542
Aces, as always.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.809
I'm going to bed.

16:16.909 --> 16:17.710
Good night.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.148
Good night.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.617
Dan, isn't that
the most perfect B

16:24.717 --> 16:26.486
you've ever seen in your life?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.988
Never seen one quite like it.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.690
Are you guys going to sign it?

16:30.790 --> 16:32.759
Allow me.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.627
You know, I think we
should call up Ms. Crane

16:34.727 --> 16:36.196
and thank her.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.597
I'll thank her for you.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.567
Wait a minute, isn't she
gonna be at that rummage sale

16:40.667 --> 16:41.668
tomorrow?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.603
That's right, we can
thank her in person.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.238
Maybe we can get a
picture of her standing next

16:45.338 --> 16:46.139
to the report card.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.312
You guys know, don't you?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.181
Know what?

16:54.281 --> 16:57.217
I didn't get a B
on my report card.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.952
You didn't?

17:00.053 --> 17:12.332
No, I got a C. On the test
that brought my average up--

17:12.432 --> 17:16.503
to a D. Which is what I
really got on my report card

17:16.603 --> 17:18.471
until I changed it.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.074
So you don't have to worry about
picking me up from basketball

17:21.174 --> 17:23.176
practice anymore.

17:23.276 --> 17:27.647
And I think the guilt
is punishment enough.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.417
That and being
grounded for three weeks.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.818
- Oh no!
- Two.

17:31.918 --> 17:32.985
Two is good.

17:35.955 --> 17:40.059
She honestly thought she
was gonna get away with it.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.494
Can you believe
that little stinker?

17:41.594 --> 17:44.131
Oh, hell, I used do
better forgeries than that.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.033
Excuse me, ma'am, you
remember this clock?

17:47.134 --> 17:48.835
How could I forget it?

17:48.935 --> 17:52.272
I seem to recall you
saying something about, uh,

17:52.372 --> 17:53.973
how I'd never get it fixed.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.975
No, I think what I
said was that if you did

17:56.075 --> 17:59.612
get it fixed you'd
have to move out.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.949
(SINGING) Any time is the
perfect time for a Canoga beer.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.384
The bear is the
one to have friends

18:04.484 --> 18:06.586
and fun so have a Canoga beer.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.021
Canoga.

18:09.122 --> 18:15.128
[burp sound] This will look
perfect up on the mantel piece.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.497
Well, now, there's no
way I want that eyesore

18:17.597 --> 18:18.631
where anybody can see it.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.067
Wait a minute, you said
I could keep one thing.

18:21.168 --> 18:24.237
And I'm it.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.440
I want the bear.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.741
Well, there's
no way that thing

18:28.841 --> 18:30.109
is going in my living room.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.778
Wait a minute, excuse
me, your living room?

18:31.878 --> 18:33.246
That's what I
said, my living room.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.314
Your living room?

18:34.414 --> 18:36.983
Yeah, my living room.
And you know why?

18:37.083 --> 18:39.018
Because you've got bad taste.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.820
I've got bad taste?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.089
You want to talk
about bad taste?

18:43.190 --> 18:44.424
What do you call this?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.025
That's imported.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.494
I call it kindling.

18:47.594 --> 18:52.131
Dan, that is is a genuine
Mexican object de art.

18:52.232 --> 18:56.002
Unlike this object
de scrap-metal.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.670
That, for your
information, happens

18:57.770 --> 19:01.674
to be an authentic replica
of a Civil War field piece.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.344
It is also a cigarette lighter.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.913
Well, good, then you
can use it to burn up all

19:07.013 --> 19:09.549
your ratty, old underwear
that you keep till they're two

19:09.649 --> 19:12.151
threads and an elastic band.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.787
Why are we always
pitching my junk?

19:14.887 --> 19:15.688
What about--

19:15.788 --> 19:17.156
Don't do that.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.891
- --your junk?
- Don't do that.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.826
Don't.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.794
Awww, you're gonna
sleep in it Mr.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.430
because I'm not cleaning it up.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.265
[dan yelling]

19:25.365 --> 19:26.466
Oh, that's it.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.734
Hey, hey, put that
field piece down!

19:27.834 --> 19:30.370
That cannon is gonna be
worth money some day!

19:30.470 --> 19:32.239
Say goodbye to it.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.640
Just say goodbye.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.587
Ugh!

19:51.157 --> 19:53.059
[gasps]

20:07.607 --> 20:09.509
Uh.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.979
[bird sounds]

20:32.499 --> 20:35.902
[crashing]

20:59.892 --> 21:01.227
Let's go to bed.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.132
[grunting]

21:06.232 --> 21:08.568
[music playing]

21:08.668 --> 21:14.474
Tell me, Miss, will you still
respect me in the morning?

21:14.574 --> 21:17.877
I'll respect you in the
morning, in the afternoon,

21:17.977 --> 21:19.446
and especially at night.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.418
[phone ringing]

21:25.518 --> 21:28.921
[grunting]

21:31.023 --> 21:32.692
Hello, Dan's House of Ecstasy.

21:35.362 --> 21:38.130
Oh, Hi, Mrs. Tucker.

21:38.230 --> 21:42.068
Yeah, that's our stuff
out on the front lawn.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.035
Just a second.

21:43.135 --> 21:43.936
Honey?

21:44.036 --> 21:45.037
Hm?

21:45.137 --> 21:48.274
How much do we want
for the coffee table?

21:48.375 --> 21:50.710
