<i>GRACE: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.707 --> 00:05.708
Well, Ben's off the hook and
there'll be nothing on his record.

00:05.743 --> 00:07.377
The whole thing is dismissed.

00:07.411 --> 00:09.512
Look, I'm in love with
Adrian. I want to marry her.

00:09.547 --> 00:11.781
You need to meet some
girls, some girls your age.

00:11.815 --> 00:13.750
Ethan wants to be my friend,

00:13.784 --> 00:15.585
even maybe my boyfriend.

00:15.653 --> 00:17.520
You're going over to
Ricky's to meet Amy?

00:17.555 --> 00:18.755
She wants to be friends.

00:18.789 --> 00:20.790
I kind of doubt she wants
to be friends with you.

00:20.824 --> 00:22.759
Who's this? They're my new best friends.

00:22.793 --> 00:25.695
A real friend would do anything
a friend needs him or her to do.

00:25.729 --> 00:28.464
What if Ben asked you
to have sex with him.

00:28.499 --> 00:30.733
And he's been trying to make me
feel bad about sleeping with Adrian!

00:30.768 --> 00:33.503
I think you might be sneaking
around trying to see Dylan.

00:33.537 --> 00:34.671
You have to have friends

00:34.705 --> 00:36.639
and these are the only
friends I can get right now.

00:36.674 --> 00:37.740
I take it you're Clementine?

00:37.775 --> 00:39.409
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

00:39.443 --> 00:40.410
I'm Grace.

00:40.444 --> 00:42.478
Clementine is at the same college

00:42.513 --> 00:43.780
that Ricky and Jack go to.

00:43.814 --> 00:45.315
You slept with her?

00:45.349 --> 00:46.616
You think you can tell me who to date,

00:46.650 --> 00:48.785
I think I should have every
right to tell you who to date.

00:48.819 --> 00:50.753
What! You two do not belong together.

00:50.788 --> 00:51.788
You want to get married?

00:51.822 --> 00:54.324
I don't care about
Ben. I care about you.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.525
I hope you'll give me a chance.

00:55.559 --> 00:56.626
Do you know what you're having?

00:56.660 --> 00:59.596
She's a girl, but I'm
letting a couple adopt her.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.266
I forgot my stupid history book!

01:04.301 --> 01:05.435
All right.

01:05.468 --> 01:07.270
Well, why did you let
me leave without it,

01:07.304 --> 01:08.371
it's on the dining room table,

01:08.405 --> 01:09.539
right next to Clementine's sweater.

01:09.573 --> 01:10.707
She left her sweater here, you know.

01:10.741 --> 01:13.476
I didn't know, and I ran
down here for this delivery.

01:13.510 --> 01:15.645
We got off to a slow start this morning.

01:15.679 --> 01:17.347
I know. (CHUCKLES)

01:17.381 --> 01:19.315
We stayed in bed too long
and now I'm going to be late.

01:19.350 --> 01:21.317
Okay, you're going to be late,

01:21.352 --> 01:23.419
not the end of the world and not really
my fault, any more than your fault.

01:24.355 --> 01:25.555
I'm not blaming you.

01:25.589 --> 01:27.457
Okay.

01:27.491 --> 01:28.725
You want me to run up and get
the book for you? No, I'll get it.

01:32.529 --> 01:34.530
What are you looking for?

01:34.565 --> 01:36.399
I don't know, just looking around.

01:45.376 --> 01:46.609
I know what you're thinking.

01:46.644 --> 01:48.378
I love being married, all right?

01:49.513 --> 01:50.546
(CHUCKLES)

01:54.451 --> 01:55.752
It's not up there, it's
probably in the car somewhere

01:55.786 --> 01:57.520
and I just didn't see it.

01:57.554 --> 01:59.489
All right, well, see you later.

01:59.523 --> 02:02.258
Oh, I forgot to tell
you, Adrian wanted me to

02:02.293 --> 02:04.394
meet up with her and Grace after work,

02:04.428 --> 02:07.263
but I don't think I want to do that.

02:07.298 --> 02:09.264
I can just come home and we
can spend some time together.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.600
It's okay with me if you meet them.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.368
We just spent some time together.

02:12.403 --> 02:15.271
I know, but we could
spend more time together,

02:15.306 --> 02:17.573
and by the time that I get home

02:17.608 --> 02:19.642
and we feed John and put him to bed

02:19.677 --> 02:22.645
and I do my homework, I
won't have time to meet them.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.547
Why are you telling me about this?

02:24.581 --> 02:26.282
Tell them. Tell Grace and Adrian.

02:26.317 --> 02:27.784
If you don't have time,
you don't have time.

02:27.818 --> 02:29.552
Well, I just thought you could tell
Adrian when you see her at school.

02:29.586 --> 02:30.720
I probably won't see Adrian today,

02:30.754 --> 02:32.455
there's no English Lit today.

02:32.489 --> 02:34.390
Not that I would tell her.

02:34.425 --> 02:38.394
So you won't see her in the
coffee shop or somewhere,

02:38.429 --> 02:39.562
even though you don't
have class together?

02:39.596 --> 02:40.730
I don't always have coffee.

02:40.764 --> 02:42.565
And I don't always see
Clementine at school,

02:42.599 --> 02:43.666
if that's what you're asking.

02:43.701 --> 02:45.668
No, I'm not asking about Clementine,

02:45.703 --> 02:48.438
I know that s's your friend,

02:48.472 --> 02:50.506
and she seems nice enough,

02:50.541 --> 02:51.674
I don't feel threatened by her.

02:52.609 --> 02:54.310
Here.

02:54.345 --> 02:55.511
Here's her sweater that she forgot.

02:55.546 --> 02:57.280
Take it to her. I don't care.

02:57.314 --> 02:58.548
I just thought if you saw Adrian,

02:58.582 --> 02:59.649
you could pass along the message

02:59.683 --> 03:01.584
that I can't meet them tonight.

03:01.618 --> 03:03.453
Okay. What's going on?

03:03.487 --> 03:06.289
Nothing is going on. (CHUCKLES)

03:06.323 --> 03:09.425
I just feel kind of
disorganized this morning

03:09.460 --> 03:12.628
because I rushed out of the house.

03:12.663 --> 03:15.498
You seem more than disorganized.

03:15.532 --> 03:18.301
All right, maybe you're
just disorganized.

03:18.335 --> 03:19.702
Let me know what you're doing tonight

03:19.737 --> 03:21.604
and if you go ouout, I can ck
up John from you at the nursery.

03:21.638 --> 03:23.406
Nah, I'm not going to go.

03:25.743 --> 03:27.343
Bye.

03:27.378 --> 03:28.411
You're sure everything is okay?

03:28.712 --> 03:29.746
Yes.

03:32.549 --> 03:35.318
If I did go out tonight,
what are you going to do?

03:35.352 --> 03:36.586
Just what I usually do.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.621
Okay. Okay?

03:38.655 --> 03:40.323
Why are you pushing me to go out?

03:40.357 --> 03:41.724
You want the house to yourself?

03:41.759 --> 03:45.294
Uh, no. And I wouldn't have the
house to myself, I'd have John.

03:45.329 --> 03:46.729
How can the day start out so good

03:46.764 --> 03:49.599
and an hour later end
up with your being crazy?

03:49.633 --> 03:52.435
If I'm crazy, maybe
it's because I'm tired.

03:52.469 --> 03:53.669
I like to get up early.

03:56.407 --> 04:02.512
And I don't mind staying up late.

04:02.546 --> 04:06.449
What I'm saying is, we can have
sex any time you want. Practically.

04:06.483 --> 04:07.583
What about what you want?

04:07.618 --> 04:09.218
Oh. I want that, too.

04:09.253 --> 04:10.386
(CHUCKLES)

04:10.421 --> 04:13.456
I mean, mornings,
nights, any time of day,

04:13.490 --> 04:15.358
any day of the week, weekends.

04:15.392 --> 04:18.327
(LAUGHING) Okay, at this point,
I think I'll venture a guess.

04:18.362 --> 04:19.495
Defensive sex?

04:19.529 --> 04:20.663
You're making yourself more available

04:20.697 --> 04:22.598
so I won't fool around
with some other woman?

04:22.633 --> 04:24.333
I'm not going to fool
around with anyone.

04:24.368 --> 04:26.235
You're my wife, we're married.

04:26.270 --> 04:29.705
No we're not, but as
soon as my mom gets back,

04:29.740 --> 04:31.641
I think we will definitely
plan that wedding.

04:31.675 --> 04:34.277
Just to keep me from fooling
around with anyone else?

04:34.311 --> 04:36.245
No. Yeah, that's it, isn't it?

04:36.280 --> 04:37.580
Amy, Clementine is a friend.

04:37.614 --> 04:40.516
She's just a friend,
a friend from my past.

04:40.551 --> 04:42.452
I brought her here and
introduced her to you

04:42.486 --> 04:43.586
so there wouldn't be a problem.

04:43.620 --> 04:45.421
I know that, and I like her,

04:45.456 --> 04:47.423
and it's not her fault
that she slept with Jack

04:47.458 --> 04:48.624
when he's supposed to be
getting back together with Grace.

04:48.659 --> 04:50.259
She didn't know.

04:50.294 --> 04:52.628
I don't know either, and
it's none of our business.

04:52.663 --> 04:56.599
But, of course, she
left her sweater here,

04:56.633 --> 05:01.204
so maybe she was planning
to come back and get it.

05:01.238 --> 05:02.472
Yeah, as soon as you left
for school on Monday morning?

05:02.506 --> 05:04.273
It could happen.

05:04.308 --> 05:06.309
A lot of things could happen,
but that's not going to happen.

05:06.343 --> 05:08.211
It's just that...

05:08.245 --> 05:11.614
(SIGHS) I was fine until
she showed up and reminded me

05:11.648 --> 05:14.317
that you're at college with
a bunch of good looking women.

05:14.351 --> 05:15.618
And Adrian.

05:15.652 --> 05:18.554
And I feel completely
vulnerable for some reason.

05:18.589 --> 05:19.622
What reason?

05:20.491 --> 05:21.557
I don't know.

05:23.594 --> 05:25.361
I'll text you later about
what I'm doing tonight.

05:25.729 --> 05:27.263
Bye.

05:29.399 --> 05:31.467
Give Clementine her sweater. Bye.

05:33.704 --> 05:36.372
(SIGHS) So much for friends.

Hi.

06:05.168 --> 06:06.202
Hi.

06:07.204 --> 06:08.237
Busy here.

06:09.172 --> 06:11.173
Take off. What?

06:11.208 --> 06:12.375
You heard me. That's my girl.

06:13.377 --> 06:14.510
Oh, you're the...

06:14.545 --> 06:16.412
Father. Yeah. Take off.

06:18.248 --> 06:19.482
Thanks for helping me.

06:25.255 --> 06:26.322
What was that?

06:27.591 --> 06:29.325
I wish I was the father.

06:30.427 --> 06:32.595
No, you don't.

06:32.629 --> 06:34.263
You don't want to be responsible

06:34.298 --> 06:36.332
for my having a baby at 15.

06:36.366 --> 06:38.467
I would never have let that happen.

06:38.502 --> 06:40.403
I'm really good with condoms.

06:40.437 --> 06:44.206
Yeah, but it's different when
you're using them for sex.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.475
Joking. (BOTH LAUGH)

06:48.211 --> 06:50.346
Does he ever call you?
The father of the baby?

06:52.215 --> 06:56.285
No. And if he did, I
wouldn't take his call.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.487
He knows the baby is being
adopted, he's fine with it.

06:58.522 --> 06:59.555
So you've talked to him.

06:59.590 --> 07:01.424
Before I left, yeah.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.526
But he never calls just to see
how you're doing or anything?

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
No.

07:05.495 --> 07:09.599
Okay, well, how are you doing?

07:09.633 --> 07:13.269
I was doing fine,
before this conversation.

07:13.303 --> 07:14.570
What is going on with you?

07:14.605 --> 07:16.472
I want you to be my girlfriend,

07:16.506 --> 07:18.574
but I don't really know how that works,

07:18.609 --> 07:22.311
especially since I can't drive.

07:22.346 --> 07:26.415
I think you just say you're my
boyfriend and that's pretty much it.

07:26.450 --> 07:29.318
It'll be years before we could
actually go out on a real date.

07:29.353 --> 07:33.489
We're both so mature, I just feel
that we should be allowed to date,

07:33.523 --> 07:36.192
I should be allowed
to drive us on dates.

07:36.226 --> 07:38.527
You're going to have to
take that up with the DMV,

07:38.562 --> 07:43.366
but in the meantime, if you
do want to go out tonight,

07:43.400 --> 07:46.435
I have to see the couple
that's adopting the baby.

07:46.470 --> 07:47.603
You can go with me, if you want.

07:47.638 --> 07:50.172
I'd love to be a part of that.

07:50.207 --> 07:51.307
Part of what?

07:51.341 --> 07:53.275
Part of your life, the baby's life.

07:53.310 --> 07:55.645
I'm not even going to be
part of the baby's life,

07:55.679 --> 07:58.614
I'm just giving her life.

07:58.649 --> 08:00.516
Still. It intrigues me.

08:00.550 --> 08:03.285
Then maybe you shouldn't go.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.287
You shouldn't really have
intrigue around something

08:05.322 --> 08:07.123
you've got nothing to do with.

08:07.157 --> 08:08.157
Should you?

08:22.406 --> 08:24.140
I've been looking for you.

08:24.174 --> 08:25.241
I'm sorry I couldn't get out,

08:25.308 --> 08:26.609
my dad told you, didn't he?

08:26.643 --> 08:28.144
Yeah, he told me.

08:28.178 --> 08:30.146
Did you talk to Henry?

08:30.180 --> 08:32.248
Yes. I talked to Henry.
Have you talked to Henry?

08:32.315 --> 08:33.416
How was I going to talk to Henry?

08:34.418 --> 08:35.484
We'll talk.

08:38.455 --> 08:41.256
Dylan, hey, I'm really sorry.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.225
My dad held me hostage this weekend,

08:43.260 --> 08:45.628
I couldn't leave the
house, not even with Alice.

08:45.662 --> 08:48.397
I think what we were up to out

08:48.432 --> 08:50.232
and I couldn't come and meet you.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.401
I couldn't even call you. I just
got my phone back this morning.

08:52.436 --> 08:54.236
Oh, it's okay.

08:54.271 --> 08:56.505
It's okay? How could
it possibly be okay?

08:56.540 --> 09:03.179
Well, Henry came over and we played
mahjong with my parents and...

09:03.213 --> 09:06.315
I'm just going to tell
you, Henry kissed me.

09:06.349 --> 09:09.218
Henry kissed you?
Wow. That is committed.

09:09.252 --> 09:11.353
(LAUGHS) He kissed me for real.

09:11.388 --> 09:13.155
What? Come on, no, he didn't.

09:13.190 --> 09:14.423
He wants to date me.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.359
Well, he can't date you, I'm dating you.

09:17.394 --> 09:19.462
And hey, he wasn't supposed
to try to trick you,

09:19.496 --> 09:21.330
he was supposed to try
to trick your parents.

09:21.364 --> 09:23.532
He told me that he saw
me at that party first

09:23.567 --> 09:27.436
and pointed me out to you and that
he's always wanted to go out with me.

09:27.471 --> 09:29.138
We saw you at the same time,

09:29.172 --> 09:33.075
and I was totally smitten
with you and I still am.

09:33.110 --> 09:34.410
Even more so now.

09:34.444 --> 09:39.248
Yeah, not being able to
go out with each other,

09:39.282 --> 09:42.084
that's a bit more of a
problem than I had imagined.

09:42.119 --> 09:45.287
What if... Just until we
can see each other again...

09:45.322 --> 09:47.523
What if I went out with Henry,

09:47.557 --> 09:49.191
just to make my parents happy,

09:49.226 --> 09:52.161
and then Henry and I could break up

09:52.195 --> 09:54.196
when you and I can see each other again.

09:54.231 --> 09:56.365
What! It's just an idea.

09:56.399 --> 09:58.300
I want to be with you,

09:58.335 --> 10:00.336
but if your dad's going
to lock you in your room...

10:00.370 --> 10:02.104
Then you're just going to go date Henry?

10:02.139 --> 10:03.472
Well... I...

10:03.507 --> 10:05.341
...can't do this right
now, I just can't.

10:07.511 --> 10:11.113
Ben! I have to ask you something.

10:11.148 --> 10:13.182
Do you regret getting involved with Amy?

10:13.216 --> 10:14.383
Why?

10:14.417 --> 10:17.086
Because I'm kind of
in the same situation.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.287
With my girlfriend, Kathy.

10:18.321 --> 10:21.223
She's having and I don't know.y

10:21.258 --> 10:23.526
I thought you could Be my mentor even.e.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.127
No.

10:25.162 --> 10:27.096
Why not? You'd be the perfect mentor

10:27.130 --> 10:29.498
and if it was official,
down in the hallways,ase you

10:29.533 --> 10:31.567
we could schedule the
required time together.

10:31.601 --> 10:34.170
I have no desire whatsoever

10:34.204 --> 10:37.339
to be your mentor or
Good day, sir.mentor.

10:39.409 --> 10:41.177
Hello, Boykewich,

10:41.211 --> 10:42.411
most seniors have gotten paired up

10:42.445 --> 10:43.579
with freshmen to be mentors,

10:43.613 --> 10:45.314
but maybe you're the
one who needs a mentor

10:45.348 --> 10:47.149
because that is not
how you treat people.

10:47.184 --> 10:48.417
It's not how you treat me anyway.

10:48.451 --> 10:50.553
Oh, please, having someone
be rude to you in the hallway

10:50.587 --> 10:53.389
is the very least of the
no doubt many offenses

10:53.423 --> 10:55.257
you'll encounter in
your high school years.

10:55.292 --> 10:57.293
You're going to be going
through a lot more than that.

10:58.428 --> 11:00.262
Hear ye! Hear ye!

11:00.297 --> 11:04.099
All ye freshmen! Gather 'round.

11:05.502 --> 11:08.170
Come on. Come. Come, it's okay.

11:09.573 --> 11:12.241
You don't need a mentor.

11:12.275 --> 11:15.444
You don't need anyone to guide you
through your first year here, no.

11:15.478 --> 11:18.614
Just listen to my words
and heed my warning.

11:18.648 --> 11:24.386
No good thing can come
of this, of high school.

11:24.421 --> 11:27.456
You are going to get
beaten up, maybe physically,

11:27.490 --> 11:30.359
but more likely
emotionally, count on it!

11:30.393 --> 11:33.329
And even if you make
friends, you'll lose friends.

11:33.363 --> 11:35.231
Even friends you've known
since the third grade.

11:35.265 --> 11:38.200
Because this is the dumping
ground of friendships

11:38.235 --> 11:39.435
and it's what high
school does to people!

11:39.469 --> 11:42.204
Just chews them up and spits
them out in little pieces!

11:42.239 --> 11:43.305
And you spend the rest of your life

11:43.340 --> 11:44.573
trying to put those
pieces back together again!

11:44.608 --> 11:49.345
So mark my words, you
will leave here damaged,

11:49.379 --> 11:52.348
and need therapy for the rest of
your lives, not that you will get it.

11:53.550 --> 11:56.252
What is wrong with you?

11:56.286 --> 11:58.320
Some of us actually enjoy high school.

11:58.355 --> 11:59.421
We've made wonderful friends

11:59.456 --> 12:01.290
that we'll have throughout our lives

12:01.324 --> 12:03.292
and we've gotten a good education,

12:03.326 --> 12:05.461
which, hello, is what we're here for!

12:06.463 --> 12:08.264
This is the best time of life!

12:08.298 --> 12:10.299
You're the most damaged!

12:10.333 --> 12:13.535
From here on out, I declare that
you will never be happy again

12:13.570 --> 12:15.304
after you leave these hallways.

12:15.338 --> 12:16.505
You're gonna spend the rest of your life

12:16.539 --> 12:18.507
trying to get back
your high school years.

12:18.541 --> 12:21.143
You're going to be chasing the
dream of how great these years were!

12:21.177 --> 12:23.145
Because you've peaked.

12:23.179 --> 12:26.582
Yes, you. You're never going to
have anything better than this,

12:26.616 --> 12:28.517
your life is over, it's done.

12:30.353 --> 12:32.388
Ben... Step into my office.

12:32.422 --> 12:33.522
What took you so long?

12:37.213 --> 12:37.213
+

12:43.710 --> 12:46.478
O'MALLEY: Are you thinking of
enrolling him in another school?

12:46.513 --> 12:48.714
LEO: I'm thinking about
going to get him if you don't.

12:48.748 --> 12:51.383
And then, I'm going to enroll
him in the school of life.

12:51.418 --> 12:52.551
I don't know what that means.

12:52.586 --> 12:53.586
I don't either.

12:53.620 --> 12:55.688
I'm just so frustrated with this kid.

12:55.722 --> 12:58.424
I don't know what to do with him.

12:58.458 --> 13:00.626
But he can't be allowed
to continue on like this.

13:00.660 --> 13:03.495
No, he can't. It's not good for anyone.

13:03.530 --> 13:05.731
Especially not Ben.

13:05.765 --> 13:09.501
(SIGHS) I completely understand
your not wanting him to see Dylan.

13:09.536 --> 13:11.737
On the other hand...
There is no other hand.

13:11.771 --> 13:13.339
He's been married.

13:13.373 --> 13:14.707
He went through the difficult decision

13:14.741 --> 13:16.475
to do what he thought
was the right thing

13:16.509 --> 13:19.345
and marry Adrian when
he got her pregnant,

13:19.379 --> 13:21.614
only to lose the baby.

13:21.648 --> 13:23.749
And then the poor guy, he
thought he'd bounce right back

13:23.783 --> 13:25.818
when he met Dylan and...

13:25.852 --> 13:28.520
Dylan may be just a little too

13:29.656 --> 13:31.590
dangerous for him. Although...

13:31.625 --> 13:32.791
There's no although.

13:32.826 --> 13:35.461
He does feel that she's
the one person in his life

13:35.495 --> 13:36.829
who brings him happiness right now.

13:36.863 --> 13:39.365
I know you think you
have this all figured out.

13:39.399 --> 13:41.433
But this isn't about Dylan.

13:41.468 --> 13:44.470
This is all about him not getting Amy

13:44.504 --> 13:45.771
and Ricky stealing his life.

13:46.606 --> 13:47.640
Oh.

13:47.674 --> 13:49.708
His entire life in high school

13:49.743 --> 13:52.745
has been centered around
Amy and what Amy is doing

13:52.779 --> 13:54.847
and what Ricky and Amy are doing.

13:54.881 --> 13:57.783
He's a smart kid, he's got a high IQ,

13:57.817 --> 14:00.719
but he's just gotten by academically

14:00.754 --> 14:05.457
when he could have excelled if he hadn't
gotten caught up with Amy Juergens.

14:05.492 --> 14:07.393
And if he doesn't let
go of Amy Juergens,

14:07.427 --> 14:09.728
he's not just going to
ruin his high school years,

14:09.763 --> 14:11.397
he's going to ruin his life.

14:11.431 --> 14:13.499
I sn't here those first couple of years.

14:13.533 --> 14:16.335
So, did you let him go out with Amy?

14:16.369 --> 14:17.569
Yeah, I let him.

14:17.604 --> 14:20.306
He saw her, he fell in love with her

14:20.340 --> 14:21.774
and she fell in love with him.

14:21.808 --> 14:24.710
Or she thought she was in love with him.

14:24.744 --> 14:26.845
He didn't know about the baby,

14:26.880 --> 14:30.282
but when he found out,
his heart went out to her,

14:30.317 --> 14:32.184
and my heart went out to him.

14:32.218 --> 14:35.087
So you kind of encouraged
him to get involved with Amy?

14:35.121 --> 14:36.989
Yeah? So what?

14:37.023 --> 14:40.125
He was happy enough,
she was happy enough.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.062
And you shared in that
happiness to what extent?

14:43.096 --> 14:45.898
To the extent th

14:47.133 --> 14:50.869
I asked George Juergens
to let Ben marry Amy

14:50.904 --> 14:53.238
and be a father to the baby...

14:54.107 --> 14:56.008
Holy cow!

14:56.042 --> 14:59.845
I'm responsible for
this? I am, aren't I?

14:59.879 --> 15:01.113
Well not responsible, but...

15:01.147 --> 15:03.115
But I had something to do with it.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.951
I never realized.

15:06.019 --> 15:07.853
I moved on and he didn't.

15:07.887 --> 15:11.256
I'm an adult and he's
still not an adult.

15:11.291 --> 15:12.991
I guess maybe if I talked to him,

15:13.026 --> 15:17.796
if I shared in some
of the responsibility

15:17.831 --> 15:19.898
for him being so obsessed,

15:19.933 --> 15:23.969
we could find some common ground
and make it easier for him.

15:25.305 --> 15:27.005
Thank you. You're welcome.

15:28.074 --> 15:30.275
Want me to go get him out of class?

15:30.310 --> 15:31.877
No.

15:33.179 --> 15:38.150
You know what? I'm going to take
some time to think about this.

15:38.184 --> 15:40.919
I want to gather my thoughts
before I talk to him.

15:41.855 --> 15:43.088
That's probably a good idea.

15:48.995 --> 15:50.996
Say hello to your family.

15:59.072 --> 16:01.874
I know that you really like Ethan,

16:01.908 --> 16:03.242
but maybe having him too involved

16:03.276 --> 16:06.178
in the pregnancy is a bad idea.

16:06.212 --> 16:08.881
It's going to be very
tough on you having a baby

16:08.915 --> 16:11.183
and then letting this couple adopt her.

16:11.217 --> 16:14.887
It's not that it's not the right
thing, because I think it is.

16:14.921 --> 16:17.790
It's still just going to be
difficult, because you love her.

16:17.824 --> 16:20.092
And, Kathy, Ethan is
falling in love with you,

16:20.126 --> 16:21.226
and the baby is a part of you

16:21.261 --> 16:23.996
and he's going to fall
in love with her, too.

16:24.030 --> 16:25.230
It's going to be very difficult for him

16:25.265 --> 16:27.132
to see you letting go of her.

16:27.167 --> 16:29.168
And in a way, you're involving him

16:29.202 --> 16:31.870
in the biggest decision of your
life, and you hardly know him.

16:31.905 --> 16:34.273
No one said anything about
being in love with anyone.

16:34.307 --> 16:36.241
You don't think Ethan
is in love with you?

16:36.276 --> 16:38.277
No! Where did you get that?

16:38.311 --> 16:41.146
From the big grin he gets on
his face every time he sees you.

16:42.849 --> 16:44.883
You noticed, too? Yes.

16:44.918 --> 16:48.120
Look, guys are just
as emotional as girls.

16:48.154 --> 16:51.890
So, if you're thinking
that he can just be a friend

16:51.925 --> 16:54.893
and then emotionally distance
himself from the baby...

16:54.928 --> 16:57.329
Well, then, I doubt that that's true.

16:58.832 --> 17:01.266
I'm not you. And he's not Ben.

17:03.036 --> 17:04.069
Ben?

17:04.103 --> 17:06.070
Yeah, Ethan was trying to get advice

17:06.105 --> 17:08.906
about being the boyfriend
to a pregnant girl from Ben

17:08.942 --> 17:11.076
when Ben blew up this morning.

17:11.109 --> 17:13.878
Oh. I didn't know. So,
that's what set him off?

17:13.913 --> 17:15.146
That's what set him off.

17:15.181 --> 17:16.915
Ethan asked for some advice,

17:16.950 --> 17:20.853
then suggested that Ben be
his mentor and then ka-boom.

17:25.258 --> 17:26.858
(SIGHS)

17:27.388 --> 17:27.388
+

17:28.597 --> 17:31.325
You're gonna have, like, a big
wedding dress, the veil and all that?

17:31.991 --> 17:34.126
Oh! We could be your
bridesmaids, if you want.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.194
'Cause you're gonna want more
than Madison and Lauren, right?

17:36.229 --> 17:38.397
(LAUGHS) Thank you, but I don't think

17:38.431 --> 17:40.399
we're going to have bridesmaids, no.

17:40.433 --> 17:43.368
And I don't think I'm going to
wear a big white wedding dress.

17:43.403 --> 17:46.004
We have a baby.

17:46.039 --> 17:49.107
I wore a big white wedding
dress and I was pregnant.

17:49.142 --> 17:50.175
Hey, you know what?

17:50.209 --> 17:51.310
Why don't you borrow my wedding dress?

17:51.344 --> 17:52.444
You could have it taken in.

17:52.478 --> 17:55.314
Thanks, but no.

17:55.348 --> 17:58.016
That's not really a good idea.

17:58.051 --> 17:59.985
Yeah, guess not.

18:00.019 --> 18:03.021
That would probably put
Ben right over the edge.

18:03.056 --> 18:05.390
Seeing that dress on you
when you're marrying Ricky.

18:05.425 --> 18:07.359
I don't know about that, but...

18:07.393 --> 18:09.227
I think I'm just going
to wear something simple.

18:09.262 --> 18:13.365
Maybe the dress that I wore
the first time we got married.

18:13.399 --> 18:15.100
When we eloped.

18:16.069 --> 18:17.936
How was that?

18:17.970 --> 18:20.272
Good. It was really good.

18:20.306 --> 18:22.174
Where'd you go?

18:22.208 --> 18:23.141
Just some place that I
read about on the internet.

18:23.176 --> 18:24.276
Where?

18:24.310 --> 18:27.045
I don't know, it was just a little town

18:27.080 --> 18:28.180
somewhere off the freeway.

18:28.214 --> 18:29.348
What little town?

18:29.382 --> 18:31.416
It wasn't like there
was a town actually,

18:31.451 --> 18:33.952
it was just this little chapel.

18:33.986 --> 18:35.287
Where'd you go for the honeymoon?

18:35.321 --> 18:39.157
A hotel, and it was very nice.

18:39.192 --> 18:40.225
You don't know the name of it?

18:40.259 --> 18:43.095
Yeah. The Blue Quail Lodge.

18:43.129 --> 18:45.130
I think eloping is
totally the way to go.

18:45.164 --> 18:49.267
Yes. Unless your family gets upset
and insists on a second wedding.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.236
Right.

18:51.270 --> 18:52.404
I think when Jack and I get married,

18:52.438 --> 18:54.339
we'll just elope and
just take our parents.

18:54.374 --> 18:56.942
Like his mom and dad and...

18:56.976 --> 18:58.143
Your mom and my dad?

18:59.212 --> 19:01.113
And when will that be Grace?

19:01.147 --> 19:02.914
I don't know, okay?

19:02.949 --> 19:05.083
But if Ricky can be faithful to Amy,

19:05.118 --> 19:06.151
then I'm sure at some point,

19:06.185 --> 19:07.352
Jack will be faithful to me

19:07.387 --> 19:10.122
and everything will work out just fine.

19:10.156 --> 19:13.325
Amy, are you sure Ricky
is faithful to you?

19:13.359 --> 19:15.127
He was never faithful to me.

19:15.161 --> 19:17.129
He's never been faithful to anyone.

19:17.163 --> 19:19.097
Yes, I'm sure that he's faithful to me.

19:19.132 --> 19:20.165
Of course I'm sure.

19:22.101 --> 19:24.102
Why? Do you know something that I don't?

19:24.137 --> 19:25.971
No. No.

19:26.005 --> 19:29.107
But if he and Clementine were
living in the same house together...

19:29.142 --> 19:32.010
Adrian, when they were,
like, 12 or something.

19:32.044 --> 19:34.079
He's never slept with her, and
he's not sleeping with her now.

19:34.113 --> 19:36.248
Well, she hardly has time
for that, I would imagine.

19:36.282 --> 19:39.151
We're married and we're
going to stay married,

19:39.185 --> 19:42.053
and neither of us are ever going to
have sexex with anyone else ever again.

19:42.088 --> 19:43.288
Yeah, well, that's fine for him,

19:43.322 --> 19:46.191
but he's the only guy
you've ever been with.

19:46.225 --> 19:47.359
Aren't you even curious?

19:47.393 --> 19:49.961
No, I'm not. I like that.

19:49.996 --> 19:51.296
I like that I've only
ever been with him.

19:51.330 --> 19:52.431
And he likes that, too.

19:52.465 --> 19:54.132
Of course he does.

19:54.167 --> 19:55.434
I never wanted anyone else.

19:55.468 --> 19:57.402
Not even Ben?

19:57.437 --> 20:01.106
Because, let me tell you, that
Benny is right at the top of my list.

20:01.140 --> 20:03.208
Not even Ben. No one other than Ricky.

20:05.411 --> 20:09.080
I slept with three guys, and Jack
is definitely at the top of my list.

20:09.382 --> 20:12.017
Really? Jack?

20:12.051 --> 20:13.151
What's wrong with Jack?

20:13.419 --> 20:15.086
Too timid.

20:15.121 --> 20:17.222
Look, I wasn't criticizing,
I was just saying,

20:17.256 --> 20:21.092
you've only ever been with the one guy,

20:21.127 --> 20:23.161
and I'm happy to say
that's not my situation

20:23.196 --> 20:25.397
because I can say
with absolute certainty

20:25.431 --> 20:27.399
that if I were to marry Omar,

20:27.433 --> 20:30.268
I would be happy to just be with
Omar for the rest of my life.

20:30.303 --> 20:32.037
Too timid how?

20:32.071 --> 20:34.039
'Cause Jack's not timid.
He's anything but timid.

20:34.073 --> 20:35.407
Hey, who am I to judge?

20:37.076 --> 20:40.212
All right. I really have to go.

20:40.246 --> 20:42.280
Oh, don't go! This is
what girlfriends do.

20:42.315 --> 20:44.015
They talk about guys.

20:44.050 --> 20:46.251
Okay. Well, I just don't
think it's nice, all right?

20:46.285 --> 20:47.385
Comparing guys sexually.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.187
Well, they talk about us!

20:49.222 --> 20:51.223
I can only answer for myself.

20:51.257 --> 20:54.426
And I don't think it's very nice
to sit around talking about guys

20:54.460 --> 20:56.194
and comparing what they're like in bed.

20:56.229 --> 20:59.030
And honestly, I'm just like really tired

20:59.065 --> 21:02.033
and I would just rather
be home with my husband.

21:03.302 --> 21:06.004
So, I made time to
be with the two of you

21:06.038 --> 21:07.339
because we're supposed to be friends.

21:07.373 --> 21:09.140
And I want to be friends,

21:09.175 --> 21:13.011
but I don't like this,
so I'm just gonna go home.

21:13.045 --> 21:15.080
Goodnight. I'll text
you later or something.

21:24.056 --> 21:25.290
Timid?

21:25.324 --> 21:26.458
(CHUCKLES)

21:37.336 --> 21:38.436
Hey, Amy.

21:39.505 --> 21:41.339
Kind of late, isn't it?

21:41.374 --> 21:43.208
Is it? I was just...

21:43.242 --> 21:45.043
Coming over to spend the night?

21:46.178 --> 21:47.379
When's mom coming home?

21:47.413 --> 21:49.147
Soon. Good.

21:49.181 --> 21:52.284
I really want to get that
wedding going. I want a wedding.

21:52.318 --> 21:54.352
Absolutely. If that's what you
want then that's what you'll have.

21:54.387 --> 21:55.387
When?

21:55.421 --> 21:57.122
The sooner the better.

21:57.156 --> 21:58.990
Are you all right?

21:59.025 --> 22:01.226
Just needed to talk to someone.

22:01.260 --> 22:03.328
All right, let's go somewhere and
talk. Want to get a bite to eat?

22:03.362 --> 22:06.331
Yeah, I would. But aren't you

22:06.365 --> 22:07.966
a little busy?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.234
I'm never too busy for you.

22:09.268 --> 22:10.368
I'll meet you at Geoff's.

22:10.403 --> 22:11.436
Okay.

22:18.444 --> 22:20.111
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

22:24.984 --> 22:26.151
George?

22:26.185 --> 22:29.154
<i>Uh, something just came up.</i>

22:29.188 --> 22:32.290
I ran into Amy out front and she
needs to go someplace and talk.

22:32.325 --> 22:35.160
I thought she was hanging
out with Grace and Adrian.

22:35.194 --> 22:38.964
All I know is, she needs to talk so...

22:38.998 --> 22:40.332
So I'll see you tomorrow?

22:40.366 --> 22:41.399
Sorry.

22:42.201 --> 22:44.035
That's okay.

22:44.070 --> 22:45.136
I love you, Kathleen.

22:46.238 --> 22:47.305
I love you.

22:52.479 --> 22:52.479
+

22:56.496 --> 22:59.734
And I stupidly invited this girl over.
It wasn't stupid.

22:59.930 --> 23:01.599
It's good for you to know
who Ricky's friends are.

23:01.799 --> 23:03.610
And he's not hiding her, so
those two aren't doing anything,

23:03.672 --> 23:05.025
if that's what you're
thinking. I'd put money on it.

23:05.218 --> 23:08.472
No. No, I don't think that
they're doing anything,

23:08.725 --> 23:13.629
but it put this doubt in my mind that
he could do something.

23:13.864 --> 23:16.049
Everyone could do something.
I think he's done enough.

23:16.266 --> 23:18.936
I don't think he's interested in doing
anything with anyone other than you.

23:20.631 --> 23:21.454
But, Dad...

23:23.532 --> 23:25.818
What if I'm boring?

23:28.493 --> 23:31.364
I'm sorry, I don't know who
to talk to other than you.

23:31.398 --> 23:33.533
No, you can talk to me.

23:33.567 --> 23:35.468
Uh, is everything okay
in that department?

23:35.502 --> 23:36.703
I can't believe I'm asking that.

23:36.737 --> 23:39.505
Yeah, I mean, I think
everything is okay.

23:39.540 --> 23:41.574
But, Dad,

23:41.609 --> 23:43.643
Ricky has been with lots of women.

23:43.677 --> 23:46.479
And I've never been with anyone but him.

23:46.513 --> 23:47.747
So how do I know?

23:47.781 --> 23:48.815
That's the girl mind talking.

23:48.849 --> 23:50.383
Guys don't think like that.

23:50.451 --> 23:51.684
I'm sure no sex is
boring to your husband.

23:51.719 --> 23:53.620
Or anyone's husband. Or
boyfriend. Or whatever.

23:53.654 --> 23:55.555
Guys just like sex.

23:55.589 --> 23:59.859
But don't guys like to have sex
with different women, not just one?

23:59.893 --> 24:01.694
No, not necessarily.

24:01.729 --> 24:03.830
There are a lot of advantages of
being in a monogamous relationship.

24:03.864 --> 24:06.532
One, it's a dangerous world out there

24:06.567 --> 24:09.702
and God only knows what you can
catch these days from casual hook-ups.

24:09.737 --> 24:12.572
And two, even if it becomes predictable,

24:13.440 --> 24:14.574
it's still good.

24:14.608 --> 24:16.476
At least you know what you're getting.

24:16.510 --> 24:18.544
It's like always having
chicken pot pie on Wednesday.

24:18.579 --> 24:20.446
Nothing wrong with chicken pot pie.

24:20.481 --> 24:21.881
You and mom, you...

24:23.751 --> 24:26.853
did do it more than once a
week on Wednesdays, right?

24:26.887 --> 24:29.622
I don't think we need to discuss that.

24:29.657 --> 24:33.426
Okay, I would just like to know if I'm

24:33.460 --> 24:36.529
genetically inferior sexually.

24:36.563 --> 24:38.798
I don't even know if
there is such a thing.

24:38.832 --> 24:40.800
It's all good. You worry too much.

24:47.675 --> 24:50.443
What are you doing eating
pizza all alone in the dark?

24:50.477 --> 24:52.412
Oh. I just felt like
having a little snack.

24:53.414 --> 24:54.814
By yourself?

24:54.848 --> 24:58.384
George was supposed to stop by
and then he ran into Amy outside

24:58.419 --> 25:00.653
and then the two of them
went to get a bite to eat.

25:00.688 --> 25:02.555
I'll see him tomorrow.

25:02.589 --> 25:07.460
Yeah, we were having a little
discussion about, you know, guys.

25:07.494 --> 25:09.362
And I think Amy got
a little uncomfortable

25:09.396 --> 25:11.431
because she's not as
experienced as Adrian and me.

25:11.465 --> 25:12.565
As you?

25:12.599 --> 25:14.667
Well, you know who I've been with.

25:14.702 --> 25:17.437
I mean, there was that
one time with Jack,

25:17.471 --> 25:18.805
and then that one time with Daniel,

25:18.839 --> 25:20.840
and then lots of times with Grant.

25:20.874 --> 25:25.712
Yeah? And your experience
makes you superior somehow?

25:25.746 --> 25:27.780
My experience just makes
me more experienced.

25:27.815 --> 25:30.550
Honey, Amy's been living
with Ricky for a while.

25:30.584 --> 25:32.418
What is this, some kind of contest

25:32.453 --> 25:34.587
of how many partners or the
number of times you've done it?

25:34.621 --> 25:36.589
Mom! Grace!

25:36.623 --> 25:37.757
No wonder Amy left.

25:37.791 --> 25:39.525
Why?

25:39.560 --> 25:42.395
Because you and Adrian
obviously made her feel awkward.

25:42.429 --> 25:43.730
Adrian was the one that
made things awkward.

25:43.764 --> 25:45.631
She's slept with both of our boyfriends.

25:45.666 --> 25:47.433
With Jack and with Ricky.

25:47.468 --> 25:49.702
And then she said that Jack's
not at the top of her list.

25:49.737 --> 25:51.571
She said he's timid.

25:51.605 --> 25:53.706
Honey, it's not nice to
share details about sex

25:53.741 --> 25:57.377
with women, or men, or anyone.

25:57.411 --> 25:59.512
Everyone is different with
every partner they have.

26:00.748 --> 26:01.748
Go on.

26:03.550 --> 26:05.451
Well, Jack may not have
been into sex with Adrian

26:05.486 --> 26:07.687
because he was just looking for sex.

26:07.721 --> 26:09.722
He didn't have any
real feelings for her.

26:09.757 --> 26:13.426
Honey, sex isn't great
every time you have sex.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.628
Or at least that's my experience.

26:15.662 --> 26:16.662
Really?

26:16.697 --> 26:18.498
(SIGHS)

26:18.532 --> 26:19.832
How do I explain it?

26:19.867 --> 26:21.467
Just try.

26:21.502 --> 26:24.604
Good sex depends on a good relationship.

26:24.638 --> 26:29.375
And a good relationship
depends on a lot of things.

26:29.410 --> 26:30.743
Good communication,

26:30.778 --> 26:32.545
how well you know someone,

26:32.579 --> 26:34.514
how comfortable you
feel around that person.

26:35.382 --> 26:37.417
What about technique?

26:37.451 --> 26:39.652
Oh please. There's
no technique involved,

26:39.686 --> 26:42.555
other than consideration
for the other person.

26:42.589 --> 26:43.756
You're kidding?

26:43.791 --> 26:46.559
Maybe oversimplifying,
but, no, I'm not kidding.

26:48.362 --> 26:49.762
Why?

26:49.797 --> 26:52.365
Are you worried about not knowing
what you're doing or something?

26:52.399 --> 26:53.433
Well...

26:54.435 --> 26:55.568
He cheated.

26:55.602 --> 26:58.404
Jack? Recently?

26:58.439 --> 27:00.773
After I talked to him
and his dad talked to him?

27:00.808 --> 27:02.341
You're kidding me!

27:02.376 --> 27:03.776
Nope.

27:03.811 --> 27:05.545
He declared his love for me,

27:05.579 --> 27:07.513
and then didn't think I would respond.

27:07.548 --> 27:10.349
So then he went and had sex with
some girl he just met at school.

27:10.384 --> 27:11.684
Okay.

27:11.718 --> 27:13.386
So what now?

27:13.420 --> 27:16.556
Now I don't know. I forgave
him and I forgave her.

27:18.525 --> 27:20.393
Truthfully, I don't even
care that he slept with her.

27:20.427 --> 27:21.661
What? I don't know.

27:21.695 --> 27:23.629
I just feel like maybe
I'm asking too much.

27:23.664 --> 27:25.531
For him to be in an
exclusive relationship with me

27:25.566 --> 27:27.467
if I'm not going to
have sex with him, so...

27:27.501 --> 27:29.368
No, you're not.

27:29.403 --> 27:31.437
You ask for at you want and if
he can't give you what you want,

27:31.472 --> 27:33.306
then get out of the relationship.

27:33.340 --> 27:35.708
Honey, if the two of you
care about each other,

27:35.742 --> 27:38.478
you will wait a while
and see how things go.

27:38.512 --> 27:39.779
But if he keeps doing that,

27:39.813 --> 27:42.482
then you need to have enough
self-respect to break up with him.

27:42.516 --> 27:44.283
I hate to say this,
Mom, but I just feel like

27:44.318 --> 27:45.518
even if I did have sex with him,

27:45.552 --> 27:48.454
he'd still want to have sex
with other women. Like dad did.

27:48.489 --> 27:50.323
I don't know. Maybe you and I...

27:50.357 --> 27:52.358
Maybe we're not

27:52.392 --> 27:53.559
capable of pleasing a man

27:53.594 --> 27:55.561
on a long term basis,
if you know what I mean.

27:55.596 --> 27:57.363
Good Lord.

27:57.397 --> 27:58.564
Well, you are sitting here alone.

27:58.599 --> 28:00.366
Where the hell did you get that notion?

28:00.400 --> 28:03.302
That is crazy. And
very self-destructive.

28:03.337 --> 28:05.438
And you made me feel
self-conscious about

28:05.472 --> 28:08.341
something that I haven't
felt self-conscious about

28:08.742 --> 28:10.743
since I was your age.

28:10.777 --> 28:14.647
Grace, I'm really happy
that we're talking.

28:14.681 --> 28:17.650
And I hope that I can save
you from a lot of anxiety.

28:17.684 --> 28:22.321
And I assure you, that there is
nothing wrong with either of us.

28:22.356 --> 28:23.523
(SIGHS)

28:23.557 --> 28:25.558
I hope not.

28:25.592 --> 28:27.660
I'd hate to see another
marriage fail for you.

28:31.057 --> 28:31.057
+

28:34.989 --> 28:38.976
- Hey, Can we talk?
- I'm kind of busy right now.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.911
Yeah, I got that one.

28:41.346 --> 28:44.048
I want to talk to you.

28:44.082 --> 28:46.083
I was hoping that you
would drop by the bookstore,

28:46.117 --> 28:47.985
have some coffee, clear the air,

28:48.019 --> 28:51.355
but, no, you're hiding in your
room so you can make this all weird.

28:51.389 --> 28:53.891
Uh, make what all weird?

28:53.925 --> 28:55.893
We were together for a
night, we had a good time.

28:55.927 --> 28:56.994
Nothing weird about it.

28:57.028 --> 28:58.962
Other than you showing up in my room.

28:58.997 --> 29:00.931
Look, I don't sleep around.

29:00.965 --> 29:04.034
I haven't slept with a lot
of guys. You came on to me.

29:04.069 --> 29:05.336
You said you were
falling in love with me,

29:05.370 --> 29:08.138
and told me we had an undeniable
attraction to each other.

29:08.173 --> 29:09.173
And you agreed.

29:09.207 --> 29:10.941
Jack, you lied.

29:10.975 --> 29:13.210
You weren't falling in love
with me, you just wanted me.

29:13.244 --> 29:15.312
Yeah, I did. And at the moment,

29:15.347 --> 29:17.948
I thought maybe I was
falling in love with you.

29:17.982 --> 29:19.950
While you were also in love with Grace?

29:19.984 --> 29:22.186
Can't a person be in love with
two people at the same time?

29:22.220 --> 29:23.253
No!

29:23.288 --> 29:25.923
<i>Doctor Zhivago? Who?</i>

29:25.957 --> 29:27.024
It was an old movie.

29:27.058 --> 29:28.926
I'm not an old movie.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.094
I'm a nice girl.

29:30.128 --> 29:32.096
And I thought that you were a nice guy

29:32.130 --> 29:34.198
and a friend of Ricky's,

29:34.232 --> 29:36.300
but he's very particular
about his friends, you know.

29:36.334 --> 29:39.036
I am a friend of Ricky's
and I am a nice guy.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.237
You're not a nice guy.

29:40.271 --> 29:42.172
You didn't even call me.

29:42.207 --> 29:43.440
I should have called you.

29:43.475 --> 29:46.143
And I shouldn't have tried to
sleep with you in the first place

29:46.177 --> 29:48.379
because I knew I thought I
was going back with Grace.

29:48.413 --> 29:51.248
It was the wrong thing to
do and I'm really sorry.

29:51.282 --> 29:53.283
That's the thing about sex, Jack.

29:53.318 --> 29:54.385
You can't take it back.

29:56.221 --> 29:59.390
You made me feel really bad about
myself when you didn't call me.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.392
And then I felt even
worse when I met Grace.

30:01.426 --> 30:04.962
Because I don't go after
guys who are in relationships.

30:04.996 --> 30:06.430
You know why?

30:06.464 --> 30:10.167
Because when I was eight, my father
left my mother for another woman.

30:10.201 --> 30:13.170
My mother became depressed, she
started drinking and doing drugs.

30:13.204 --> 30:15.372
And eventually I was
taken ouout of my home

30:15.407 --> 30:17.174
and was basically unadoptable

30:17.208 --> 30:19.176
because my dad was still around,

30:19.210 --> 30:22.312
he just didn't want to
take responsibility for me.

30:22.347 --> 30:26.250
So I went from one home
to another, to another.

30:26.284 --> 30:30.187
All because my dad wanted to sleep
with a woman that he wasn't married to.

30:31.089 --> 30:32.289
And he didn't marry her.

30:32.323 --> 30:34.191
He stayed with her a couple of years

30:34.225 --> 30:37.294
and then he moved on to another,
and another, and another.

30:37.328 --> 30:40.330
So when I do something stupid

30:40.365 --> 30:43.400
like believe auy when he says
he's falling in love with me,

30:43.435 --> 30:46.236
I get really angry with myself.

30:47.071 --> 30:48.272
And with the guy.

30:49.474 --> 30:51.008
I keyed your truck.

30:51.376 --> 30:52.409
Goodnight.

30:58.349 --> 31:01.051
Not really. But I thought about it.

31:03.221 --> 31:04.254
(SIGHS)

31:12.464 --> 31:14.198
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

31:18.236 --> 31:21.271
Hello. I was wondering
if you were going to call.

31:21.306 --> 31:23.040
Are you studying? I was.

31:23.074 --> 31:24.408
And then Clementine dropped by.

31:26.077 --> 31:28.078
She just yelled at me and left.

31:28.112 --> 31:30.914
Oh. Well, good for Clementine.

31:30.949 --> 31:32.983
Although, she could have
done that over the phone.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.351
<i>I was avoiding her calls.</i>

31:34.385 --> 31:36.286
Well, next time she calls, pick up.

31:36.321 --> 31:39.122
There's not going to
be a next time, Grace.

31:39.157 --> 31:40.357
I've been really stupid.

31:40.391 --> 31:43.260
<i>I've been trying to get
back with you for years.</i>

31:43.294 --> 31:46.230
And if all it takes for
you to take me seriously

31:46.264 --> 31:50.000
is that I go back to church
and try to be a better person,

31:50.034 --> 31:53.003
a Christian even, then
that's what I'm going to do.

31:53.037 --> 31:54.438
Because Clementine yelled at you?

31:56.341 --> 31:59.009
Never mind. I'll take it.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.344
Thank you.

32:00.378 --> 32:03.347
Jack, this is going to be so
great, you and me. Together.

32:03.381 --> 32:06.183
Not having sex again.

32:06.217 --> 32:07.951
I love you.

32:07.986 --> 32:09.219
(SIGHS) I love you, too.

32:15.193 --> 32:16.226
Thanks.

32:19.264 --> 32:23.033
So you don't even see
yourself in competition

32:23.067 --> 32:25.035
with the deceased Dr.
Bowman or Dr. Tsegaye?

32:25.069 --> 32:27.104
Hell, no. It's not a competition.

32:27.138 --> 32:29.206
When Kathleen and I married the
first time, things were fine,

32:29.240 --> 32:30.941
and I'm sure things
will be better this time.

32:30.975 --> 32:33.176
I hope so. 'Cause she
cheated on you the first time.

32:33.211 --> 32:35.312
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

32:35.346 --> 32:37.214
But that wasn't about
sex, that was about socks.

32:38.383 --> 32:40.217
It's a long story.

32:40.251 --> 32:43.086
Sex is about relationships and
Kathleen and I have a good relationship.

32:43.121 --> 32:44.888
You and Ricky have a good relationship.

32:44.923 --> 32:46.256
Yeah, if I don't turn out...

32:46.291 --> 32:47.324
If you don't turn out what?

32:47.358 --> 32:48.892
(CHUCKLES) Nothing.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.093
Were you going to say gay?

32:50.128 --> 32:51.261
Do you think I'm gay? Are you kidding?

32:51.296 --> 32:52.329
Why would you think you're gay?

32:52.363 --> 32:54.231
It would seem you're
the opposite of gay.

32:54.265 --> 32:56.099
I don't know what I mean by that.

32:56.134 --> 32:57.367
Oh. Oh, I know.

32:57.402 --> 32:59.202
Because your mom is gay and
the rumors did bother you.

32:59.237 --> 33:01.104
Yes, they did. Of course they did.

33:01.139 --> 33:03.073
Amy, you're not going to
wake up one day and be gay.

33:03.107 --> 33:05.075
Mom did. No, she didn't.

33:05.109 --> 33:08.045
It just took a long
time for her to go there.

33:08.079 --> 33:09.313
When we grew up, things were different.

33:09.347 --> 33:11.114
People were not so accepting.

33:11.149 --> 33:12.983
Not that they're totally accepting
now, but things are better.

33:13.017 --> 33:14.518
And hopefully things
will keep getting better.

33:14.552 --> 33:18.055
Because hopefully more and more
parents and kids are talking about sex.

33:18.089 --> 33:21.024
I'm just afraid that
I'm doing something wrong

33:21.059 --> 33:22.926
and that Ricky is going
to go off to someone else

33:22.961 --> 33:24.294
because I'm doing something wrong.

33:24.329 --> 33:27.030
And then I will have wrecked
two lives, Ricky's and Ben's.

33:27.065 --> 33:31.868
Ben is still not over me and I may
not even be a suitable obsession.

33:31.903 --> 33:34.004
Look, people want to
believe gays are born gay.

33:34.038 --> 33:36.106
But to me, that implies that there
is a reason that people are gay

33:36.140 --> 33:38.041
and that implies that
there needs to be a reason.

33:38.076 --> 33:39.876
I don't like people blaming being gay

33:39.911 --> 33:41.078
on genetics or anything else,

33:41.112 --> 33:42.879
because no blame needs to be assigned.

33:42.914 --> 33:44.081
People are gay or they're not,

33:44.115 --> 33:45.282
and it doesn't matter
where that comes from.

33:45.316 --> 33:47.084
And just because your parent is gay

33:47.118 --> 33:48.952
does not mean you are gay. I swear.

33:48.987 --> 33:51.254
All right, all right.

33:51.289 --> 33:55.058
I mean, I don't know
if gays are not born gay

33:55.093 --> 33:56.927
or it could be a gene.

33:56.961 --> 33:58.929
Griffin and his two
brothers are all gay.

33:58.963 --> 34:00.097
His parents aren't!

34:00.131 --> 34:01.398
No one has found a gay gene.

34:01.432 --> 34:03.066
And I question why we're
even looking for one.

34:03.101 --> 34:05.302
But let's get back to you.

34:05.336 --> 34:07.137
I think you just met
this friend of Ricky's

34:07.171 --> 34:08.938
and you're just feeling insecure.

34:08.973 --> 34:09.973
And you're afraid he's
going to fool around

34:10.007 --> 34:11.108
and so you're blaming
yourself for something

34:11.141 --> 34:12.175
I don't think will ever happen.

34:12.210 --> 34:14.043
He's a good guy.

34:14.078 --> 34:15.379
But I don't think it would
hurt to have a second wedding,

34:15.413 --> 34:17.214
you know, to seal the deal.

34:19.050 --> 34:21.150
Yeah, me neither. Why's that?

34:23.955 --> 34:26.223
Don't tell me anything
I don't want to know.

34:26.257 --> 34:28.958
Thanks for dinner. Sure.

34:28.993 --> 34:30.127
Ben's still pining for you?

34:30.161 --> 34:31.161
Yeah.

34:33.866 --> 34:33.866
+

34:36.777 --> 34:39.880
- You wanted to see me?
- Hours ago.

34:39.915 --> 34:41.782
I didn't feel like it hours ago.

34:41.817 --> 34:44.719
Who are you kidding? You've
been holding out for hours

34:44.753 --> 34:47.822
even though you were curious
about what I wanted to say to you.

34:47.856 --> 34:48.956
What do you want to say to me?

34:55.563 --> 34:56.563
I'm sorry.

34:56.797 --> 34:58.666
You're what?

34:58.700 --> 35:01.635
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
how much pain you've been in.

35:01.670 --> 35:04.672
And I heard about your little
speech you gave in the hallway,

35:04.706 --> 35:09.710
and I realized that your high
school years have been really lousy.

35:09.745 --> 35:10.811
Partly because of me.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.013
How so?

35:13.048 --> 35:14.749
I'm the one who
encouraged you to go for it

35:14.783 --> 35:15.850
when you fell in love with Amy

35:15.884 --> 35:17.618
and I shouldn't have done that.

35:17.652 --> 35:19.954
I should have at least
tried to discourage you.

35:19.988 --> 35:21.756
You did try to discourage me.

35:21.790 --> 35:23.657
Or you tried to discourage Amy.

35:23.692 --> 35:24.892
I didn't do a very good job.

35:24.926 --> 35:27.628
I believe at one point
you sent me to Bologna.

35:27.662 --> 35:29.597
Which didn't work.

35:29.631 --> 35:31.565
Although it was a nice distraction.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.767
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.

35:32.801 --> 35:34.735
Yeah, I kind of did enjoy myself.

35:34.770 --> 35:36.804
But what's your point?

35:36.838 --> 35:39.974
Is this your excuse for taking
extreme measures to keep me from Dylan,

35:40.008 --> 35:42.576
because you didn't try hard
enough to keep me from Amy?

35:42.611 --> 35:43.811
I don't need an excuse.

35:43.845 --> 35:45.780
At this point you should be able to see

35:45.814 --> 35:48.549
that that's not a healthy
relationship for you.

35:48.583 --> 35:49.884
You know what? I think
maybe the problem is that

35:49.918 --> 35:51.685
you went from doing nothing

35:51.720 --> 35:53.754
and giving me complete freedom
to choose who I want to be with

35:53.789 --> 35:54.955
to being a prison guard.

35:54.990 --> 35:57.591
I'm trying to smooth things
over with you here, so...

35:57.626 --> 35:58.926
So what? Nothing has changed.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.828
I'm still standing
here getting a lecture

36:00.862 --> 36:02.730
and I still can't go out with Dylan.

36:02.764 --> 36:04.565
But believe me, I'm gonna
find a way to see her.

36:04.599 --> 36:06.000
You probably will. I will.

36:06.034 --> 36:07.535
Go ahead.

36:07.569 --> 36:09.603
Although I hear she's seeing Henry now.

36:09.638 --> 36:10.805
For real.

36:10.839 --> 36:12.606
Where did you hear that?

36:14.810 --> 36:16.710
Dylan's father. They
seem to really like him.

36:16.745 --> 36:18.579
They don't even know him!

36:18.613 --> 36:20.214
They don't know what a scoundrel he is!

36:20.248 --> 36:22.016
He turned on me.

36:22.050 --> 36:23.050
He was supposed to go
over there to trick them

36:23.084 --> 36:24.819
into letting Dylan go out with me

36:24.853 --> 36:26.086
and then he went for it.

36:26.121 --> 36:28.789
He kissed her! And you slept with Alice.

36:28.824 --> 36:30.024
Well, he doesn't know that.

36:30.058 --> 36:31.225
He might. How?

36:32.928 --> 36:34.094
Did you tell him? No.

36:34.129 --> 36:36.797
Well, the only people that
know that are me, you and Alice.

36:39.801 --> 36:40.901
Are we done here?

36:40.936 --> 36:42.970
Unless you want to apologize
for your own behavior.

36:43.004 --> 36:44.238
No. I don't.

36:44.272 --> 36:46.207
My own behavior is completely justified.

36:46.241 --> 36:47.808
I own it.

36:48.276 --> 36:49.810
Good night.

36:56.151 --> 36:57.785
(SIGHING)

36:57.819 --> 37:00.221
Ah! Look who made himself a sandwich.

37:00.255 --> 37:03.057
I can take care of myself. I
can totally take care of myself.

37:03.091 --> 37:05.793
I've been taking care of
myself since I was eight.

37:05.827 --> 37:07.094
Uh-oh. Girlfriend trouble?

37:10.198 --> 37:11.832
What makes you say that?

37:11.867 --> 37:13.100
Your attitude.

37:13.969 --> 37:15.002
What's up?

37:18.006 --> 37:21.141
I was invited to go with Kathy
to meet the adoptive parents,

37:22.844 --> 37:25.112
then I got uninvited.

37:25.146 --> 37:28.115
Oh. No surprise.

37:28.149 --> 37:30.818
Looks like someone didn't
think through that invitation

37:30.852 --> 37:32.753
before she extended it.

37:32.787 --> 37:34.688
What do you mean?

37:34.723 --> 37:37.992
I mean you don't need to get
in the middle of an adoption.

37:38.026 --> 37:41.795
It's a very vulnerable
situation and it can be wonderful

37:41.830 --> 37:44.031
or things can go wrong.

37:44.065 --> 37:46.000
Like what?

37:46.034 --> 37:51.705
Like a boyfriend trying to keep
a girlfriend from giving up a baby

37:51.740 --> 37:55.676
after she's found the right
couple, the right home.

37:55.710 --> 37:57.912
I wouldn't say anything about
her giving away her baby.

37:57.946 --> 37:59.947
She's not giving her away.

37:59.981 --> 38:03.817
She's providing a good home
and good parents for her

38:03.852 --> 38:06.053
by allowing the baby to be adopted.

38:06.087 --> 38:08.822
It's a very unselfish thing to do.

38:10.725 --> 38:16.063
And it's not like knowing your mother
and then having your mother abandon you.

38:17.065 --> 38:19.099
She's not abandoning her.

38:19.134 --> 38:22.069
I wasn't thinking that, I
know she's not like my mother.

38:22.103 --> 38:24.738
It's not the same situation I was in.

38:24.773 --> 38:26.040
Then what were you thinking?

38:26.074 --> 38:27.775
I don't know, that maybe...

38:30.111 --> 38:32.746
You have a lot of kids
in and out of here,

38:32.781 --> 38:34.114
you have, so...

38:36.117 --> 38:38.052
maybe you could take the baby.

38:38.086 --> 38:42.923
Ethan, that's just the kind
of thing I was talking about.

38:43.925 --> 38:45.659
This is not our issue.

38:45.694 --> 38:47.828
This is none of our business.

38:47.862 --> 38:50.764
Kathy has her own plan,

38:50.799 --> 38:53.901
and that's her baby, and
she's doing the right thing.

38:58.173 --> 39:00.074
Well, excuse me for trying to help.

39:00.942 --> 39:02.076
Hey!

39:05.146 --> 39:06.714
(SIGHING)

39:21.963 --> 39:22.963
Hi. Hi.

39:24.132 --> 39:26.066
For someone who didn't
have time to go out,

39:26.101 --> 39:27.801
it's kind of late, isn't it?

39:27.836 --> 39:30.704
Yeah. I went out with my dad.

39:30.739 --> 39:32.706
I went over to see Grace's guest house

39:32.741 --> 39:33.974
and hang out with her and Adrian,

39:34.009 --> 39:35.943
and as I was leaving, I ran
into my dad and we went out.

39:36.878 --> 39:37.911
You could've called me.

39:38.213 --> 39:40.681
I guess.

39:40.715 --> 39:43.751
u weren't worried about me, were you?

39:43.785 --> 39:46.987
Yeah, I was worried about you.
It's late, it's a school night.

39:47.022 --> 39:48.022
I know.

39:49.157 --> 39:50.958
What's so funny?

39:50.992 --> 39:53.994
Well, you know, you're
just being kind of parental.

39:55.163 --> 39:56.730
What's going on?

39:56.765 --> 39:58.165
It's just that you were so concerned

39:58.199 --> 40:00.768
about my sneaking around
and sleeping around

40:00.802 --> 40:03.003
and then you go out and stay out
hours longer than I thought you would.

40:03.038 --> 40:05.706
So I thought maybe you were
sneaking around and sleeping around.

40:05.740 --> 40:07.875
Did you give Clementine
her sweater back today?

40:07.909 --> 40:09.877
No. I didn't. It's still in my car.

40:09.911 --> 40:12.146
And really, next time you're
out all night, call me.

40:12.180 --> 40:13.981
Or at least text me.

40:14.015 --> 40:16.784
Out of battery. How convenient.

40:16.818 --> 40:18.752
I'm sorry. I should have called you.

40:18.787 --> 40:21.722
I didn't know that
you'd be so concerned.

40:21.756 --> 40:22.990
All right, well, next time...

40:23.224 --> 40:25.025
Next time.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.960
What were you and your dad
talking about until 11:00 at night?

40:26.995 --> 40:29.797
Does he know we didn't go through
with it, we're not married?

40:29.831 --> 40:31.732
He might, he's not saying.

40:31.766 --> 40:33.067
So you didn't talk about that?

40:33.101 --> 40:34.868
No. We talked about sex.

40:35.804 --> 40:37.671
Generic sex or us?

40:37.706 --> 40:39.773
Us. Or not us. Me.

40:39.808 --> 40:41.008
What?

40:41.042 --> 40:42.743
(EXHALING)

40:42.777 --> 40:43.944
Might as well just tell you.

40:43.978 --> 40:46.013
You might as well tell me what?

40:46.047 --> 40:48.949
I wanted to rush off and get married

40:48.983 --> 40:52.786
not only because I don't want
my weird family at our wedding,

40:52.821 --> 40:54.955
but because...

40:54.989 --> 40:57.858
Because I just thought that

40:57.892 --> 41:00.694
I might be gay like my mom.

41:00.729 --> 41:02.763
So, I kind of wanted
to rush and get married

41:02.797 --> 41:04.698
before I woke up gay one morning.

41:04.733 --> 41:05.833
What?

41:05.867 --> 41:06.934
I know, I'm an idiot.

41:06.968 --> 41:09.036
I'm not gay, I know I'm not gay.

41:10.038 --> 41:11.872
But after everything that's happened,

41:11.906 --> 41:15.876
it just made me wonder,
and I don't know.

41:15.910 --> 41:19.046
Well, maybe we should
take some time tonight

41:19.080 --> 41:20.881
to make sure you're not gay.

41:20.915 --> 41:23.150
I knew you'd turn any
discussion about this into that.

41:23.184 --> 41:24.785
So, that's why I talked to my dad.

41:24.819 --> 41:26.920
I'm sorry. You could have talked to me.

41:26.955 --> 41:28.088
I don't think you're gay.

41:28.123 --> 41:29.790
I don't think I'm gay, either.

41:29.824 --> 41:32.793
But I've been thinking about it, Ricky.

41:32.827 --> 41:35.095
And you've been with a lot of women

41:35.130 --> 41:38.031
who might be better in bed than I am.

41:38.066 --> 41:40.667
And it might be because
I'm inexperienced

41:40.702 --> 41:43.871
or it might be because I'm gay.

41:45.073 --> 41:46.874
Nothing is better than being with you.

41:46.908 --> 41:48.809
Nothing has ever been
better than being with you.

41:48.843 --> 41:51.779
Sex for me to begin with
was an expression of anger.

41:51.813 --> 41:53.914
Then it became just sex for sex.

41:53.948 --> 41:56.116
And then it became kind of fun.

41:56.151 --> 41:59.186
But only as long as there wasn't
any emotional aspect to it.

42:00.889 --> 42:02.156
Once I fell in love with you

42:02.190 --> 42:04.024
and I knew I wanted to be with
you for the rest of my life

42:04.058 --> 42:07.961
and that you felt the same
way, I mean, that was it.

42:07.996 --> 42:10.898
It was a completely
different experience.

42:10.932 --> 42:12.032
But it's still fun, right?

42:13.735 --> 42:14.802
It's still fun.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.815
(PHONE RINGING)

42:32.687 --> 42:33.687
Hello.

42:33.721 --> 42:34.755
Well?

42:34.789 --> 42:35.789
Well what?

42:35.824 --> 42:36.890
Did you play the jealousy card?

42:38.059 --> 42:39.693
Yeah.

42:39.727 --> 42:40.761
Did it work?

42:40.795 --> 42:42.029
Yeah.

42:42.063 --> 42:44.097
See. That's how you Just
don't take it too far.

42:45.033 --> 42:46.033
Okay.

42:47.035 --> 42:48.836
I know a little something.

42:48.870 --> 42:50.003
Have a nice life.

42:50.038 --> 42:51.038
Thanks.

42:51.039 --> 42:55.039
