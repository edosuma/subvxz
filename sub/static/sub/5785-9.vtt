00:03.629 --> 00:04.914
-Thanks, mister.
-Yeah.

00:07.758 --> 00:10.921
Bany said that you need our help.
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

00:11.095 --> 00:13.177
Give her to me
and I'll make your death fast.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.805
The man you're looking for
is Vandal Savage.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.469
Chay-Ara. it's me. Khufu.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.263
We're drawn to each other in each life,
and after we die, we reinoamate.

00:24.483 --> 00:25.689
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

00:25.943 --> 00:27.444
In every lifetime. he hunts us down.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.107
MALCOLM: We think he's trying
to locate the Staﬁ' of Horus.

00:31.115 --> 00:32.776

00:47.548 --> 00:49.049
(DRUMMING CONTINUES)

00:54.138 --> 00:58.347
Prince Khufu. my son,
what have you come to offer?

00:59.810 --> 01:04.349
Father, we bring this tribute to the
protector of all we see and know, Horus.

01:04.732 --> 01:05.812
Praise be upon him.

01:06.025 --> 01:09.313
It is a ﬁne offering, Khufu.
a feast worthy of a god.

01:09.654 --> 01:13.067
And yet, Priestess Chay-Ara
does not seem to agree.

01:14.325 --> 01:18.238
Your offering is lovely, my prince.
If not a bit naive.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.819
(SCOFFS)

01:20.498 --> 01:21.738
1m:

01:22.708 --> 01:26.701
To think that Horus would
be appeased by triﬂes.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.538
The portents of his dissatisfaction
grow with each passing day.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.336
The celestial rocks used to fall
once a generation.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.422
Now they strike
with each phase of the moon.

01:35.763 --> 01:39.005
I thought it was your job to keep
Horus in a good mood, Priestess.

01:39.725 --> 01:43.092
Priestess Chay-Ara only speaks
out of concern for all.

01:43.729 --> 01:47.096
Othewvise, she would remain
a bit more polite.

01:47.858 --> 01:51.396
We have warned you, time and again,
of the sky rocks and the threat they pose

01:51.612 --> 01:56.231
to the court of Ramesses the Vlﬁse.
Dark times are coming, my pharaoh.

01:56.701 --> 01:59.864
Prayers and triﬂes will not
be enough to stop them.

02:03.374 --> 02:07.538
Priestessl
You spoke with quite the tongue in there.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.380
1mm;

02:10.715 --> 02:12.706
No. I love your tongue.

02:23.602 --> 02:24.728
You okay?

02:24.895 --> 02:26.886
Yeah. I'm ﬁne. I just have a headache.

02:27.231 --> 02:30.815
Are you sure? Usually, that's a sign
of your memories returning.

02:32.278 --> 02:35.896
Yeah, I'm sure.
I can't remember anything yet.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.567
A bunch of superheroes in a farmhouse?

02:42.413 --> 02:43.619
Feel like I've seen that
in a movie before.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.405
What's wrong with S.T.A.R. Labs?

02:46.584 --> 02:47.824
Well, I mean, absolutely nothing,

02:48.085 --> 02:49.746
if you forget about
the revolving door you guys installed

02:49.962 --> 02:51.577
so the bad guys can
come and go as they please.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.753
Remind me again
what happened to your old lair?

02:53.966 --> 02:54.955
[om

02:55.134 --> 02:57.750
Well, lair number one was
compromised by the police.

02:58.137 --> 03:00.469
And I will stop helping.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.092
Savage only let Bany
and I live because he felt Kendra

03:03.267 --> 03:05.178
start to emerge as Hawkgirl
and went after her.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.097
He can sense her and Carter's presence.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.512
We don't need to make it easier
on him by staying in the city limits.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.685
Bet you wish you stayed at
your mother's place now.

03:12.276 --> 03:16.315
We need to ﬁnd a way to neutralize
Savage's advantage. Bany, you're late.

03:16.614 --> 03:19.447
Sony. It turns out it's not easy
ﬁnding the ass-end of nowhere.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.442
Yeah, for real. The roaming charges alone
are going to bankrupt me.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.822
We're discussing how to take away
Savage's new-found power.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.324
His magic stick thing.

03:26.624 --> 03:27.784
Uh, Staff of Horus.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.459
Well, it's protected by
some kind of energy ﬁeld.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.829
-I couldn't lay a ﬁnger on it.
-Maybe wear mittens next time.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.002
What if we made some sort of
insulated gauntlets?

03:34.298 --> 03:36.630
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The magnetic shielding could disrupt the—

03:36.801 --> 03:38.632
-Staff's magnetic polarity.
-Yeah.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.842
-Well, while the geek squad works...
-FELICITY: Heard that, honey.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.795
While they work to get
the staff away from Savage.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.051
we need to know everything
there is to know about him.

03:45.518 --> 03:49.557
Well, I googled "reincarnated nutjobs"
and came up with nothing.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.972
Uh, Kendra and I would be the reincarnated
nutjobs. Savage is merely immortal.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.228
-Merely?
-Welcome to the new normal.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.317
Anyone who's been around
for 4,000 years should leave a trail.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.361
I'll check with A.R.G.U.S.
See if they have anything on him.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.734
Uh, Laurel and I can check
police reports and stuff like that.

04:01.992 --> 04:05.234
Good. We need to ﬁnd a way to
utilize your new ability.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.494
-My ability?
-It might give us an advantage.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.537
Yeah. Whatever you do.
don't let him train you.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.742
I'm sony, but when it rains, I can still
feel where you shot me with those arrows.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.334
I'II handle her training then.

04:14.547 --> 04:16.333
-Yeah.
-Oliver.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.377
I need to run something down.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.212
And what exactly are you running down?

04:24.432 --> 04:25.421
Don't wony. It's nothing dangerous.

04:25.683 --> 04:26.923
Well, are you okay?

04:27.435 --> 04:30.427
Well, we're up against an immortal madman
armed with a magical staff.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.178
so I do have a few things on my mind.

04:32.398 --> 04:35.686
Yeah, but you were acting ﬁne
with everything while we were home.

04:36.026 --> 04:39.735
And now that we're here in Central City,
you've just been not you.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.895
Well, maybe it's too bright
and sunny for me here.

04:44.410 --> 04:47.868
There is something going on,
and I'm going to tell you all about it.

04:48.038 --> 04:52.202
I would just like the chance to know
what I'm dealing with ﬁrst.

04:52.710 --> 04:53.790
Okay.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.250
Okay.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.251
Heyl You must be going
through a lot right now.

04:59.592 --> 05:01.708
Yeah. You know, we should talk.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.086
Never in the history of romance have those
words ever meant anything good.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.218
I just mean we should probably talk
about everything that's happened.

05:08.601 --> 05:09.636
That's happening.

05:09.894 --> 05:12.886
You know what? I'm gonna suggest something
radical here and say let's not talk.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.936
Look, you got a lot
on your plate right now,

05:15.149 --> 05:17.435
and I just don't want to be that piece
of very nutritious broccoli

05:17.651 --> 05:19.266
that you scrape off the plate
to give to the dog.

05:19.570 --> 05:23.404
My point being, I don't think you can
afford to be distracted right now.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.482
Let's go.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.400
Yes. Let's.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.569
Sony. buddy. This is private.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.951
-Private?
-Yep.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.923
I'm just gonna go do some
push-ups over there.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.586
Open it.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.960
Why? What's inside?

05:46.597 --> 05:49.088
Something we have to track down
in each of our incarnations.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.593
Sometimes, I ﬁnd it.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.674
Sometimes, you ﬁnd me
and we go look for it together.

05:53.187 --> 05:57.271
Four thousand years, 206 lives. we've seen
about every combination there is.

06:02.655 --> 06:03.940

06:08.953 --> 06:09.942
I don't think l'm really—

06:10.120 --> 06:12.953
Ready for this.
You say that in every lifetime.

06:14.458 --> 06:18.167
Look, as you emerge. as your memories
come back to you, so will other things.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.711
Skills. Languages.
Pieces of your prior lives.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.385
There you go.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.679
Oh, this is nuts.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.220
It's okay. I'll help you through it.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.886
Yeah, well, the last time you "helped" me.
I got pushed off a building.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.517
Yes. and after that, you, uh,
you soared, if I remember correctly.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.469
And that is because
anger. fear. adrenaline,

06:37.690 --> 06:40.022
those are the things
that bring out the warrior within.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.182
Well, according to Savage.
I'm a priestess.

06:42.653 --> 06:46.487
The clergy were warriors. Warrior priests.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.569
And that is the side that you
need to remember.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.484
And if I can't?

06:52.329 --> 06:56.538
Well, then we'll, uh,
both probably die. Again.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.391

07:24.737 --> 07:27.570

07:36.290 --> 07:39.202

not to wonder because...

07:40.794 --> 07:44.537
He's what, nine? And, you know,
we had our thing 10 years ago.

07:44.757 --> 07:46.293
-Okay. let me stop you right there.
-All right.

07:46.550 --> 07:50.042

07:51.722 --> 07:55.089

after moving to Central City, so...

Vandal Savage. You, me and the speedster.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.414
What? Wait, why—

08:28.801 --> 08:31.668
Because negotiation is the only
way out of this situation, Oliver.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.421
Savage is going to decimate
Central City to get what he wants.

08:35.766 --> 08:37.927
If your child were here,
you would understand.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.601
Suit up. I've already spoke with
ﬂeet feet. He's on his way.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.027

08:55.285 --> 08:58.493
Thank you for coming.
I know this is more than a little crazy.

08:58.789 --> 09:01.701
Yeah. Well, your friend with
the creepy ring asked so nicely.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.032
Please tell me we're not going to
negotiate with terrorists.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.294
Or, you know, 4,000-year-old bad guys.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.167
Just think of this more
as a fact-ﬁnding mission.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.873
Maybe Savage slips up
and gives us something

09:11.135 --> 09:12.341
that we can use to our advantage.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.002
(LAUGHS) Thea said you were being
a little bit more humorous lately.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.637
I'm sony. How do you know
so much about Savage. anyway?

09:17.850 --> 09:20.182
I don't know anything about him,
Mr. Allen. No one does.

09:20.644 --> 09:22.145
That is why I'm aﬁaid of him.

09:22.396 --> 09:27.140
That's not the only reason to be
aﬁaid of me. I assure you.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.319
-Thank you for joining me.
-What do you want?

09:40.539 --> 09:43.872
What all living things want. Not to die.

09:44.168 --> 09:45.999
I thought that wasn't a problem for you.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.578
Only if I take the life force from
Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara.

09:51.508 --> 09:56.377
The three of us are locked in a vicious
circle played out over thousands of years.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.757
None of your concern.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.222
We've made it our concern.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.058
(GRUNTS)

10:08.609 --> 10:12.727
Robin of Locksley.
I taught him how to use a bow.

10:13.405 --> 10:18.240
He taught me how to not feel pain.
I'm the enemy you can't defeat.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.735
The only way for you
and yours to live through this

10:21.955 --> 10:24.037
is to render unto me what is mine.

10:25.042 --> 10:28.455
Turn over Prince Khufu and
Priestess Chay-Ara within 24 hours,

10:28.712 --> 10:32.955
or I will lay waste to this city,
killing everyone that you hold dear.

10:34.635 --> 10:39.595
And after that, I will travel to
your home and do the same thing there.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.051
All right, I'm just curious, did you
rehearse that speech in a mirror

10:42.267 --> 10:44.258
this morning or is this all
just off the cuff?

10:44.728 --> 10:45.968
(LAUGHS)

10:48.315 --> 10:52.729
Why would you risk the lives of
your friends and family for two strangers?

10:53.487 --> 10:56.320
Two hundred and six times
I have killed them.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.407
What hubris possesses you that makes you
think that you can prevent me

11:00.619 --> 11:02.075
from doing so again?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.162
Not hubris. Hope.

11:05.749 --> 11:10.243
I came to this meeting out of curiosity.
It is now sated.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.167
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial in 24 hours

11:14.508 --> 11:18.672
or I will see you dead and buried
under the bodies of your loved ones.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.924
We're not giving up Kendra and Carter.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.434
That's not your decision to make.

11:27.813 --> 11:30.350
This is a cycle that has played out
for the last 4,000 years.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.639
Savage may be immortal,
but he isn't a god.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.442
-No. But he's the next best thing. Oliver.
-What?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.936
You better be certain that
your stubbornness

11:38.115 --> 11:39.525
does not get my daughter killed.

11:39.825 --> 11:42.942
Because if that happens,
I will come for you,

11:43.328 --> 11:46.866
and in a way that will make you beg
for the likes of Vandal Savage.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.293
OLNER: Twenty-four hours.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.704

11:51.962 --> 11:55.204
Until we are supposed to hand you
and Carter over to Savage or...

11:55.465 --> 11:58.002
-Savage lays waste to Central City.
-Yep.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.834
We've been through this before.
1887, The Huang He ﬁood,

12:01.054 --> 12:03.511
Savage killed nearly two million people
to get to us. And he did.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.547
We weren't helping you then. We are now.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.470
We have 24 hours to come up
with a workable plan.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.391
No, this is insane. My life isn't worth
millions of people's lives.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.223
-Kendra... I'll talk to her.
-Yeah.

12:14.651 --> 12:15.811
Hey, I got this.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.317
.mlllmmm

12:18.363 --> 12:21.730
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't we just
toss him over to Vandal Savage?

12:22.534 --> 12:23.649
(MUTTERING)

12:23.827 --> 12:24.987
-Where were you?
-Hey.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.824
You missed the whole save the city
or turn my girlfriend over

12:28.040 --> 12:29.496

12:36.006 --> 12:37.712
-Yeah. I think I'm gonna—
-Don't say it.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.712
-I think I'm going to time jump-
-I just told you not to say it!

12:40.928 --> 12:42.338
I'm sony. I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.011
Bany, the ﬁrst rule of time travel is
you don't talk about time travel!

12:45.223 --> 12:47.214
Because by having this conversation,
we're screwing history.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.595
Look, I know that time travel
has consequences.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.184
I mean, the last time you vibed—

12:51.355 --> 12:55.098
Well, I'm not vibing anything right now.
Okay. um, all right, look, don't panic.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.395
A, you don't know that you
time-jumped for a bad reason.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.273
It could have been a good one, right?
B, now that you know you time-jumped.

13:00.530 --> 13:05.194
you might not do it, right? So, knowing
the future might change the present,

13:05.452 --> 13:07.363
which might change the future.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.029

13:10.374 --> 13:11.784

13:12.042 --> 13:14.249
Chay-Aral Sony. Kendra.
You shouldn't run off.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.873
-We don't know if Savage is—
-Do we ever kill ourselves?

13:18.632 --> 13:22.045
In our prior lives. Savage has to kill us
in order to live forever.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.637
Do we ever kill ourselves
in order to deny him that?

13:25.555 --> 13:28.388
You know, in our past lives, I'm typically
the one that makes the plans.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.467
And I'm starting to think
this is probably why.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.058
Everyone in there is willing
to die to protect us.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.556
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

13:37.818 --> 13:42.812
No. I think it's noble.
I think it's what makes them all heroes.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.156
Yeah, well, heroes or not.
I'm not letting anyone die for me.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.900
Then don't.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.156
Be the person. the woman,
the warrior you were meant to be.

I'd like to do that,

14:07.681 --> 14:09.797
I'm really not in the mood right now.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.804
Oh, really? Well, I'll just tell Savage

It's the only way of ﬁnding

Um, John, Laurel and Thea are back.
and they've got something.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.482
Where are Oliver and Bany?

14:59.691 --> 15:01.227
Oliver's back in secret-keeping mode,
apparently.

15:01.485 --> 15:04.352
Bany, I don't know. Caitlin and Cisco
are working on the anti-Staff gauntlets.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.902
What do you guys have?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.031
Betamax. Aw. Where'd you get this?
Off of eBay?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.323
Lyla hooked us up.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.575
Yeah, well, it's gonna
take a while to play,

15:12.829 --> 15:14.035
since we live in a digital world now.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.032
The tape came from a conspiracy theory
group that's interested in Savage.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.752
The Pentagon had a ﬁle
on Savage back in '86,

15:20.003 --> 15:21.584
but it's all been heavily redacted.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.037
Got it.

15:23.256 --> 15:28.751
Is this on? I hope so.
My name is Dr. Aldus Boardman.

15:29.179 --> 15:34.845
I'm a professor at St. Roch University.
The date is April 8th, 1975.

15:35.769 --> 15:40.183
I don't think anyone else knows this.
And those that do don't believe.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.015
He's a myth. An urban legend.

15:43.235 --> 15:47.569
He's been compared to Machiavelli and
Nostradamus. He's gone by many names.

15:48.031 --> 15:52.525
But I know him as Vandal Savage,
and he will be the death of the world.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.281
But I believe there is a way to stop him.

15:55.747 --> 15:59.205
Savage is an immortal Egyptian priest.

15:59.876 --> 16:03.368
His long life is the result
of an unearthly calamity.

16:04.047 --> 16:08.290
I believe that any object associated
with this calamity should be able to

16:08.552 --> 16:10.543
maimnmmmm

16:11.138 --> 16:16.223
And I suspect that our precious,
ﬁagile world may one day depend upon us

16:16.560 --> 16:17.766
doing so.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.468
Well, that's the understatement
of the year.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.061
Or. you know, the last 4,000 years.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.391
You have any idea what he meant
by these objects? This calamity?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.771
No, I don't recall a calamity.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.069
-The staff.
-The Staff of Horus?

16:30.323 --> 16:33.565
Yes. I think the staff belonged
to Savage back in ancient Egypt.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.578
I'm m1

16:35.745 --> 16:37.326
It's a hunch.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.572
And if Professor Boardman's
guess is right,

16:39.791 --> 16:41.827
that staff is how we kill Savage.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.663
Okay, someone needs to inform
Oliver and Bany.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.339
Okay. Here you go.
I gene-sequenced the hair strand

16:50.594 --> 16:52.130
with the blood sample you gave me.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.337
Still not sure what it has to do with
Damien Darhk. but the Y chromosomes match.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.428
Are you okay?

17:01.271 --> 17:02.511
Thanks for this. It's a big help.

17:02.772 --> 17:03.978
Yeah. You're wel...

-Yeah?

17:06.276 --> 17:07.857
Don't tell anyone about this.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.525
All right.
I'd like to know what's going on here.

Um, well, actually. it's, um. it's
something Oliver wanted me to track down.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.626
-It's about Damien Darhk, I think.
-I want to see it.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.048
Why?

17:32.302 --> 17:33.462
Because you don't want me to see it.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.714
-I'm sony. Oliver speciﬁcally asked me—
-Show me.

17:35.972 --> 17:40.181
Okay. I don't know what the big deal is.
It's just a DNA test.

I know, Samantha.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.006
I know that Vlhlliam is my son.

-Okay.
-Why didn't you tell me?

18:20.350 --> 18:25.014

Your mother told me not to.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.060
She offered me a million dollars
to tell you that I miscarried.

My mother was a complicated person.
but she would never do that.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.451

18:55.135 --> 18:58.218
I didn't need her money to know
I didn't want her anywhere near my child.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.886
Or me anywhere near him.

19:00.223 --> 19:03.090
So, what? He can be just like his dad?

19:03.393 --> 19:06.601
Punching out paparazzi and
getting young girls knocked up?

19:06.813 --> 19:08.474
Samantha. I'm not that person anymore.

19:08.732 --> 19:12.441
I know. I know you're running for mayor.
Your mother was killed.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.734
Your friend Tommy.
You're a different person now,

19:14.946 --> 19:18.279
but can you really tell me
that your life is any less crazy?

19:18.742 --> 19:20.733
Can you honestly say
that Vlhlliam isn't better off

19:20.910 --> 19:23.162
with your world kept away from his?

19:23.455 --> 19:27.414
You know, you're right. I'm being selﬁsh,
but I want an opportunity

19:27.667 --> 19:30.079
to get to know my son.
And I think that a young boy deserves

19:30.253 --> 19:32.335
the opportunity to get to know his father.

19:32.589 --> 19:37.128
Look, he's happy. He's well-adjusted.
I don't want to run the risk of him

19:37.427 --> 19:39.588
getting sucked into your orbit.
That can't happen.

19:39.846 --> 19:45.091
Which means that he can't know that
you're his father. And nobody else can.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.346
I don't care if that sounds harsh.
I'm his mother,

19:47.604 --> 19:51.813
and I will do whatever
I feel I have to do to protect him.

19:52.609 --> 19:57.023
Samantha. there is someone in my life now.
Please. don't make me keep this from her.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.193
Oliver, you will if you want
a relationship with my son.

20:01.951 --> 20:05.284
These are my conditions.
You've already asked the world of me.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.616
I'm just asking for the same in return.

I had to take care of.

So I guess you're off
the secret-keeping wagon.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.131
-That's not it.
-Then what is it?

20:26.893 --> 20:30.181
(SIGHS) I think Damien Darhk has
someone operating in Central City.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.561

-God. Oliver,

21:01.094 --> 21:03.005
you are the only person on this planet

21:03.263 --> 21:05.345
who considers the truth "complicated."

21:05.932 --> 21:08.765
Just to be clear,
I don't care that you have a child,

21:09.018 --> 21:11.725
I can't believe that you have a child
that you didn't tell me about.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.852
I care that you lied to me just now.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.602
Do you know that my whole world
just exploded?

21:17.110 --> 21:22.525
And I think that I'm entitled to a minute
to process that by myself.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.694
You somehow managed to go
to C.C.P.D. and track down Bany.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.114
You didn't keep it to yourself.
You kept it from me.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.702
When were you planning on telling me?

21:31.124 --> 21:32.364
I don't know.

21:35.378 --> 21:41.795
If you loved me. if you trusted me.
telling me this wouldn't be such a burden.

21:42.051 --> 21:47.387
It would be a relief.
But you don't trust me.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.639
You never will.

21:50.894 --> 21:53.476
And how can I be with someone
who doesn't trust me?

22:00.236 --> 22:01.442
Felicity...

22:02.238 --> 22:03.978
Are you guys okay?

22:05.158 --> 22:06.614
Oliver? What happened?

22:07.076 --> 22:08.327
Nothing. I'm ﬁne.

22:09.412 --> 22:12.825
Are you sure? I mean, you don't seem ﬁne.
You seem out of it.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.753
-Are the gauntlets working?
-They're gonna have to be.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.168
-We're out of time.
-I think they'll work.

22:26.429 --> 22:29.762
That staff's gonna go from
Can't Touch This to Invisible Touch.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.592
Savage doesn't know
Kendra has access to her full abilities.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.307
which makes you our ace in the hole.
We're gonna put you up against Savage.

22:36.523 --> 22:39.014
You attack with the element of surprise.
I will lay down cover ﬁre.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.310
Bany, you speed in and...

22:40.527 --> 22:42.609
-Snatch the staff. I got it.
-DIGGLE: Where do you need us?

22:44.989 --> 22:46.775
This is me, Bany, Kendra and Carter.
We've got it.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.026

-No. We're not risking any more

And dressed for the occasion, I see.

23:07.512 --> 23:10.629
We're only doing this because
two lives aren't worth two cities.

23:10.848 --> 23:14.887
Well, in that case. you are wiser
than I gave you credit for.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.344

23:17.564 --> 23:22.479
It's been a lifetime. Still wearing
those ridiculous outﬁts, I see.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.812
You don't need to be here for this.

23:27.031 --> 23:31.991
The culling has a tendency
to be unsightly.

23:32.495 --> 23:35.578
(SCOFFS) Your new friends betrayed you.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.322
Just do what you're going to do.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.997
It's wonderful to see you again, my love.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.086
I will never be your love.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.338
I know.

23:46.676 --> 23:47.882

23:48.678 --> 23:51.670

25:44.127 --> 25:47.460
Thank you for coming.
I know this is more than a little crazy.

25:54.429 --> 25:58.672
I came to this meeting out of curiosity.
It is now sated.

25:59.142 --> 26:02.600
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial in 24 hours

26:02.812 --> 26:06.930

Bany, you all right?

26:21.664 --> 26:22.653
(PANTING)

26:22.832 --> 26:25.619
We need to brief the team.
Come up with some type of counter attack.

26:33.676 --> 26:34.791
Hey, what's going on?

26:35.011 --> 26:37.343
Okay, look. This isn't going to make
any sense to you, but I... (SIGHS)

26:37.555 --> 26:40.797
All right, so I traveled back in time
from when we tried to take out Savage.

26:41.017 --> 26:44.555
(STUTTERS) I mean, later, when we try
to take him down. in the future,

26:46.856 --> 26:49.017
You're right.
That doesn't make sense to me.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.518
My world is stranger than yours.

26:50.735 --> 26:52.691
Well, maybe we use that to our advantage.

26:52.987 --> 26:56.354
You say that whatever we do
against Savage doesn't work?

26:56.657 --> 26:58.488
-Yeah.
-Then we come up with a new plan.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.362
No. No, no, no.
Okay, look, you can't.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.528
(STUTTERS) When I mess with time,
it just... It doesn't end well.

27:03.706 --> 27:06.243
But what you're telling is
that it already doesn't end well.

27:06.501 --> 27:09.868
Bany, people in our line of work,
we don't get second chances.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.331
Vim m K11 m

27:11.714 --> 27:12.999
All right. I hope you're right.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.255
All right.
Let's start with what went wrong.

27:16.219 --> 27:20.428
You did. When we go up against Savage.
your head's not in the game.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.342
-You're not yourself.
-Why not?

27:22.725 --> 27:25.262
-Oliver, l—
-Bany, why not?

27:26.604 --> 27:29.767
Okay, are you planning on
giving me a hair sample

27:30.024 --> 27:31.730
to run forensics on in the near future?

27:32.735 --> 27:33.724
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:33.903 --> 27:37.441
Well, I did. And you were
pretty shaken after the fact.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.777
And then Felicity found out.
And you guys had a pretty big ﬁght,

27:41.035 --> 27:42.571
and it sounded like it was over
between you two.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.076
What was the ﬁght about?

27:44.580 --> 27:45.786
(SIGHS)

27:47.583 --> 27:50.245
I'm pretty sure you're
someone's father, Oliver.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.203
(SIGHS)

27:54.423 --> 27:56.880
So when we go up against Savage.
you're not focused.

27:57.093 --> 27:59.254
And then Kendra can't access her powers

27:59.595 --> 28:03.258
and then the tech they're developing to
counteract Savage's staff does not work.

28:03.641 --> 28:04.926
(SIGHS)

28:05.101 --> 28:06.932
Everyone dies, Oliver.

28:08.437 --> 28:12.225
This time, they won't.
This time, we do things differently.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.270
Hovv're they coming?

28:19.490 --> 28:23.574
For my ﬁrst pair of anti-Gandalf
magic staff gloves. pretty good, I think.

28:23.786 --> 28:25.117
Yeah, just double and triple check. okay?

28:25.288 --> 28:26.994
I'm a little worried
about them not working.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.125
Call it a gut instinct.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.622
Also, I need you to talk to Kendra.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.795
Oh, I get it. You shoot arrows,
you give love tips.

28:37.091 --> 28:38.456
It's like you're Cupid or something.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.416
What Carter is doing with her
isn't working.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.092
We need her power to ﬁght Savage.

28:42.305 --> 28:44.466
and we need her
to be able to use it reliably.

28:44.807 --> 28:48.015
Carter's a jerk. But he's supposed to be
with her, 'cause destiny says

28:48.311 --> 28:50.597
they're supposed to be together
and he's supposed to be her soulmate.

28:50.813 --> 28:52.098
So I'm not even sure
what I could say—

28:52.315 --> 28:54.601
You need to do something, Cisco.
We need to reach her.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.149
Egyptian reincarnation is not
in my wheelhouse.

28:57.820 --> 29:01.483
What Kendra is going through
is about accepting who she really is.

29:01.699 --> 29:05.487
Who better to help her do that than a guy
who is clearly in love with her?

29:08.372 --> 29:10.988
I don't know if we're at
the L-bomb stage yet.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.786
.Hllﬂlmm

29:15.004 --> 29:16.164
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

29:16.339 --> 29:18.955
No. I think it's noble.
I think it's what makes them all heroes.

29:19.342 --> 29:22.505
Yeah. that's nice. I'm gonna talk
to Kendra for a minute, He-Man.

29:22.678 --> 29:23.963
(CHUCKLES)

29:30.519 --> 29:31.850
PRINT-FIFE!!!

29:32.188 --> 29:34.725
I thought you were the one that said
we should wait till this was all over.

29:34.982 --> 29:38.691
Oh, this isn't that talk. This is the
trying-to-heIp-you-sprout-wings talk.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.527
Yeah, well, according to Carter,
I'm a warrior priestess,

29:41.822 --> 29:43.858
and rage is the key to
rediscovering myself.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.861
Yeah, I'm not surprised
Mr. Aggro thinks that,

29:46.035 --> 29:47.741
but I think he's got
this whole thing twisted.

29:48.037 --> 29:51.370
Instead of focusing on the warrior,
focus on the priestess.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.197
And the nurturer.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.082
The good-hearted person inside.

29:55.419 --> 29:58.035
How do you know I was so
goodhearted 4,000 years ago?

29:58.339 --> 30:01.706
Because I know you, Kendra.
and some things don't change.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.542
I think you're resisting what
Carter's trying to teach you

30:04.720 --> 30:08.053
because it means remembering who you were,
and that is somebody else.

30:10.226 --> 30:11.432
Somebody who loves him.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.062
Ever since I emerged,

30:18.401 --> 30:20.187
I've been remembering our ﬁrst life.

30:20.403 --> 30:21.563
In Egypt.

30:21.779 --> 30:25.363
But I've been telling Carter I can't
remember anything because

30:25.783 --> 30:30.698
I don't want to accept that I'm some
reincarnated Egyptian warrior priestess.

30:30.913 --> 30:31.902
(SIGHS)

30:32.123 --> 30:35.911
Okay. Yeah, that's pretty heavy.

30:37.628 --> 30:39.414
But it's also pretty amazing.

30:40.381 --> 30:42.087
I've been through this. You know I have.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.750
And what you're going through
right now, this is a gift.

30:46.262 --> 30:49.254
It's a miracle that most people
don't even get to experience.

30:49.557 --> 30:51.468
Yeah, well, it feels like a nightmare.

30:51.767 --> 30:55.305
Yeah, but that is a choice.
You can choose the other thing.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.811
To remember who you are, or who you were.

31:00.151 --> 31:03.268
Close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

31:04.447 --> 31:05.562

31:05.781 --> 31:10.571
Let yourself... Let yourself remember.

31:17.126 --> 31:20.459
Hey, hey, hey, wait.
Stay a little longer?

31:22.965 --> 31:27.629
I can't. Hath-Set and I need to make
another offering to Horus.

31:28.304 --> 31:31.637
The augers have said more
sky rocks will be falling soon.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.797

31:34.477 --> 31:36.843
How fortunate I know the man
who can handle him.

31:37.855 --> 31:42.189
Prince Khufu.
What a surprise to ﬁnd you here,

31:43.486 --> 31:45.147
in Chay-Ara's bed chamber.

31:45.613 --> 31:50.323
Surely you must know that the clergy
is forbidden to lie with royalty.

31:51.202 --> 31:52.282
Get out.

31:52.495 --> 31:55.987
The penalty for such
a transgression is death.

31:56.332 --> 31:58.869
I said get out.

(GASPS)

33:33.429 --> 33:35.590
What? What happened?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.926
I think I know how to beat Vandal Savage.

33:44.982 --> 33:48.224
Oliver, you were right. I don't know
how you knew, but you were right.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.651
The gauntlets won't work.
They're missing a critical element.

33:51.155 --> 33:53.396
-How do you know?
-Because I remembered.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.774
I remember how Savage killed us
the ﬁrst time. Back in Egypt.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.447
I've never been able
to remember our ﬁrst death.

33:59.622 --> 34:01.487
Well, these sky rocks. meteors,

34:01.790 --> 34:04.452
they fell and they completely
destroyed the royal palace.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.413
During the Middle Kingdom,
Egypt experienced a high level

34:06.629 --> 34:07.914
of meteorite activity.

34:08.297 --> 34:09.332
1mm

34:09.590 --> 34:11.831
Which is one of the many reasons
we love you so much,

34:12.134 --> 34:14.250
but also doesn't seem
to help us stop Savage.

34:14.470 --> 34:16.961
It's the calamity Professor Boardman
was referencing.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.422
The meteors, they had a glow about them.

34:19.642 --> 34:22.759
And Savage's staff had two gemstones
with the exact same glow.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.640
Yeah, the gemstones might be made up
of the same element as the meteorite.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.687
The Egyptians would use meteorite
in their craftsmanship.

34:27.942 --> 34:29.648
And the minerals glow
in proximity to each other.

34:31.278 --> 34:34.315
Oh, wait, the Indiana Jones reference is
the only thing I understood.

34:34.490 --> 34:36.822
Two pieces of the same meteorite,
like an Nth metal.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.948
That is the key
to counteracting the staff.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.652
Believe it or not. that isn't actually
the craziest thing I've heard today.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.445

the meteorite ﬁem the Middle Kingdom

34:46.835 --> 34:47.961
(SIGHS) Hopefully, I got the right one.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.001
I could synthesize a compatible
isotope out of this,

34:50.172 --> 34:51.161
and coat the gauntlets with it.

34:51.340 --> 34:55.299
Okay, do it. Savage doesn't know
that Kendra's gained access

34:55.511 --> 34:57.627
to all of her abilities.
That makes you our ace in the hole.

I'm having the strangest deja vu.

37:11.814 --> 37:13.770
(SIGHS) You're not the only one.

37:21.990 --> 37:25.858
CISCO: So, how do you feel now
that Savage is pushing daisies?

37:26.203 --> 37:28.159
Does this mean you guys
are the immortal ones now,

37:28.330 --> 37:30.992
and he's the one who gets reincarnated?
'Cause that would suck.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.619
I just sprouted wings a few days ago,

37:33.836 --> 37:35.201
and I'm just trying
to wrap my head around that.

37:35.546 --> 37:37.502
You know, he does raise
a good point, though.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.496
Savage is gone for good now, right?

37:39.842 --> 37:42.504
I don't know.
We've never defeated him before.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.463
31' l ‘UEU 1:! 151:!

37:45.806 --> 37:46.841
Ugh, get a room.

37:47.057 --> 37:48.672
Finally have the rest of
your lives in front of you.

37:48.851 --> 37:49.966
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do?

37:50.185 --> 37:52.847
Carter says in our past lives
we used to help people.

37:53.063 --> 37:55.179
After everything
you guys have done for me,

37:55.524 --> 37:56.889
I think I should give that a try.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.184
You make it sound like this try
is happening somewhere else.

38:00.362 --> 38:02.978
In our prior incarnation,
we used to live in Saint Vlhlkin.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.529
You really liked it there.

38:05.409 --> 38:07.149
Could Cisco and I have a moment?

38:08.370 --> 38:09.576
Of course.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.488
(SIGHS) Here we go.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.877
Cisco, I'm really sony.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.749
You know what? It's ﬁne. It's cool.
It's actually kind of a classic story.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.881
Boy meets girl, boy gets girl,
girl sprouts wings and ﬂies away

38:23.051 --> 38:25.212
with her reincarnated soulmate.
The only part I don't get is,

38:25.429 --> 38:27.545
you don't even really seem to like him.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.259
It's kind of a complicated relationship.

38:31.393 --> 38:35.056
Like most 4,000-year-old
relationships are, I guess.

38:35.272 --> 38:37.388
-(LAUGHS)
-A week ago, I was a barista.

38:37.608 --> 38:40.691
And I really didn't have a plan
for what I was going to do with my life.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.567
And now you do?

38:43.071 --> 38:44.902
Well, at least I know I want to ﬁnd out.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.359
(SIGHS)

38:49.244 --> 38:52.077
Okay. I made you something.

38:52.915 --> 38:54.576
To remember me by. I guess.

38:55.250 --> 38:58.538
I made it out of the Nth metal
that Bany got from the meteorite.

38:58.754 --> 39:00.585
It's got a micro-GPS chip embedded in it.

39:00.923 --> 39:03.881
So if you're ever in trouble,
I'll come ﬁnd you.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.557
I'll r H We“ 1 mm:

39:14.895 --> 39:16.260
For being you.

39:17.439 --> 39:18.645
Thank you, Cisco.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.108
Well, you did it, Bany.
Everyone's alive.

39:24.404 --> 39:25.610
Our guardian angel.

39:25.948 --> 39:28.439
That's what you told me I could be
when I told you about my powers.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.949
Meant it then, and I know it now.

39:31.954 --> 39:36.323
Hey, Oliver, um. we need to have
a difﬁcult conversation, I think.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.791
About my son?
God, it feels weird to say that.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.753
Well, less about your son
and more about whether or not

39:43.966 --> 39:45.422
you're gonna tell Felicity about him.

39:45.634 --> 39:46.840
I don't think that's any of your business.

39:47.094 --> 39:49.426
You know, yeah, you're right.
It's not really my business.

39:49.638 --> 39:53.005
Except I told you, when I mess with time,
time messes back.

39:53.267 --> 39:55.303
And we've already changed
how things turned out with Savage.

39:55.519 --> 39:57.009
And I'm worried about temporal backlash.

39:57.271 --> 39:59.978
Wait, do you think that the timeline
cares about what I tell my girlfriend?

40:00.315 --> 40:01.304
What are you gonna tell her?

40:01.483 --> 40:03.815
Well, you're right when you say
that the rules keep changing

40:03.986 --> 40:07.979
and that the lives that we lead,
they make us feel powerless.

40:08.657 --> 40:12.149
And it makes me wonder
if Vlhlliam wouldn't be better off

40:12.369 --> 40:13.984
with my world kept separate from his.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.780
Look, Oliver, take it from someone
who didn't get to grow up with his father.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.117
I think the best thing for Vlhlliam
is for you to be a part of his life.

40:22.838 --> 40:24.044
Thanks, Bany.

40:24.673 --> 40:25.958
Yeah, man.

40:26.508 --> 40:28.464
(LAUGHS) I'm not really a hugger.

40:29.011 --> 40:30.672
Yeah. Tell me something I don't know.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.549
But the thing is, I am fast enough
to just hug you without you knowing,

40:33.807 --> 40:36.173
-so you might as well let me.
-Fine.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.643
Thanks. That wasn't so bad. right?

40:43.567 --> 40:47.310
These are my conditions, Oliver.
You've already asked me for the world.

40:47.529 --> 40:49.565
I'm just asking for the same in return.

40:53.201 --> 40:54.407
(SIGHS)

40:57.539 --> 40:58.824
Okay.

41:00.876 --> 41:02.366
I won't tell anyone.

41:04.546 --> 41:05.831
Even Felicity.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.167
Felicity. That's a nice name.

41:08.717 --> 41:12.050
She is a nice person. She's the best.

41:15.182 --> 41:17.013

41:19.186 --> 41:21.051

41:34.951 --> 41:36.236
Can I tell you a secret?

41:37.120 --> 41:38.405
I've actually met the Flash.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.701
I'IVIMEMHHIEIMH

41:42.918 --> 41:47.287
Yeah. He's super cool.
He's one of the best guys that I know.

41:50.258 --> 41:54.922
I'm Oliver. I'm a friend of your mom's.
We've known each other a long time.

41:56.056 --> 41:57.592
Wanna play action ﬁgures?

41:57.933 --> 41:59.139
Sure. Sure.

42:02.437 --> 42:06.271
Vlhlliam, I'd love to come by
every once in a while to say hello.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.314
Would that be all right with you?

42:09.277 --> 42:11.438
That's Captain Cold. He's a bad guy.

42:12.280 --> 42:16.398
Yes, he is. The Flash is gonna
have to be very fast to catch him.

42:19.663 --> 42:20.948
-Ohl
-Got you.

42:24.459 --> 42:29.624
Oh, what a mess.
Oh, we have to clean this place up.

42:29.965 --> 42:34.959
Unless you're ready to tell me
what you said you'd tell me.

42:35.262 --> 42:36.877
(SIGHS) Felicity, um...

42:37.097 --> 42:42.308
Oliver, we have a life together, right?

42:42.769 --> 42:44.475
-We're a team.
-Ow.

42:45.814 --> 42:49.306
If something is bothering you,
and I don't know about it,

42:49.818 --> 42:53.402
I can't help you ﬁx it.
I can't be a good teammate.

42:54.239 --> 42:55.570
I love you.

42:56.408 --> 42:59.491
And that makes me want to be
the best teammate ever.

43:00.662 --> 43:03.153
Not in the Lance Armstrong
performance-enhancing drugs kind of way.

43:03.331 --> 43:06.164
More like the more positive
sports analogy I would use

43:06.418 --> 43:07.828
if I knew anything about sports.

43:10.672 --> 43:13.459
What had you acting so strange
when we got to Central City?

43:18.013 --> 43:21.676
And I am back in Star City. Vlhth you.

43:23.351 --> 43:24.682
-Mmm.
-Come here.

Your hate will be everlasting.
Your enmity will never die.

43:43.705 --> 43:48.870
It will follow them from this life
into the next and the next.
