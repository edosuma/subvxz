00:00.038 --> 00:01.718
<i>Previously on When Calls the Heart...</i>

00:01.744 --> 00:02.633
What do you think, Laura?

00:02.658 --> 00:03.828
Yes to being your nanny.

00:03.852 --> 00:05.055
Fiona Miller.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.552
I operate the telephone switchboard.

00:06.577 --> 00:08.578
Rosemary, there is no me and Carson

00:08.603 --> 00:10.218
except as doctor and nurse.

00:10.243 --> 00:12.568
There is definitely a spark
between you and Carson.

00:12.594 --> 00:14.273
<i>You two are perfect for each other.</i>

00:14.298 --> 00:16.018
Bill, you have been in a mood all week.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.692
This wouldn't have anything
to do with you losing out

00:17.717 --> 00:18.885
on the saloon, would it?

00:18.910 --> 00:20.938
This guy just swoops in out of nowhere?

00:20.963 --> 00:23.578
This new saloon owner sounds
like a rogue and a scoundrel.

00:23.603 --> 00:25.554
You wouldn't happen
to be this new owner,

00:25.579 --> 00:26.569
by any chance?

00:26.594 --> 00:28.904
Lucas Bouchard at your service.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.208
He finally stopped fussing.

00:39.233 --> 00:40.506
You were right.

00:40.531 --> 00:42.920
A stroll around the
pond was all he needed.

00:43.096 --> 00:45.308
Ah, such a handful last night.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.227
Nothing I did would calm him down.

00:47.252 --> 00:49.009
You must be exhausted.

00:49.034 --> 00:51.470
Well, Rosemary came over
when she heard him crying

00:51.495 --> 00:53.531
and then before long Lee came over, too.

00:53.556 --> 00:55.182
We took turns napping.

00:56.044 --> 00:57.764
I would like to have you
and Rosemary and Lee

00:57.789 --> 00:59.024
over for dinner.

00:59.049 --> 01:01.785
My way of saying thank you for
everything you've done for us.

01:01.819 --> 01:03.621
Oh, that sounds lovely.

01:03.653 --> 01:05.155
Well, how is the little man doing?

01:05.188 --> 01:06.650
He's doing great.

01:08.391 --> 01:09.879
So are you heading somewhere?

01:09.904 --> 01:11.073
Yeah, Cape Fullerton.

01:11.098 --> 01:12.499
They've called me in
as an expert witness

01:12.524 --> 01:13.926
on this gunrunner trial.

01:13.951 --> 01:16.577
A couple of bad guys from
the Northern Territories.

01:17.162 --> 01:19.914
Well, hopefully they end
up behind bars forever.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.008
They will.

01:21.033 --> 01:22.750
It's an air-tight case.

01:23.371 --> 01:25.915
Elizabeth, you should be proud.

01:25.940 --> 01:27.656
Jack chased these guys for a long time.

01:27.681 --> 01:28.336
Yeah.

01:28.361 --> 01:29.799
His work is finally paying off.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.802
I'm just glad it's coming to an end.

01:32.507 --> 01:33.345
Be safe.

01:33.370 --> 01:34.597
Thanks.

01:37.838 --> 01:39.430
It is outrageous!

01:39.455 --> 01:40.222
I mean, what does he think this is,

01:40.247 --> 01:41.182
Union City?

01:41.207 --> 01:42.376
No, I agree.

01:42.401 --> 01:44.647
Something needs to be done about this.

01:45.341 --> 01:46.425
What's wrong?

01:46.450 --> 01:48.786
It's that Lucas Bouchard.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.844
Have you noticed what's been
happening at the saloon?

01:50.869 --> 01:53.405
I have put up with his
remodelling during the day,

01:53.430 --> 01:54.756
but that noise?

01:54.781 --> 01:55.767
At night?

01:55.792 --> 01:57.826
At 11:00 I could hear it at my house.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.115
Yes, we heard it too.

01:59.147 --> 02:00.602
It woke up poor Cody.

02:00.627 --> 02:02.362
This isn't how Tom ran the saloon.

02:02.387 --> 02:04.388
And the music he plays.

02:04.413 --> 02:06.984
It is quite provocative.

02:07.009 --> 02:08.077
Mmmhmm.

02:08.237 --> 02:11.133
So, what're we gonna do about it?

02:40.863 --> 02:45.347

02:52.922 --> 02:54.633
Good morning.

02:59.390 --> 03:00.890
Here's your book back, Mrs. Thornton.

03:00.915 --> 03:02.024
Thank you, Emily.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.712
I wish we had a library in town.

03:03.737 --> 03:05.082
I'm working on it.

03:05.107 --> 03:06.855
Someday.

03:10.493 --> 03:11.775
Guys, wait up.

03:11.969 --> 03:13.304
Good morning, boys.

03:13.336 --> 03:14.571
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:21.020 --> 03:23.627
You are getting pretty fast
on that bike there, Timmy.

03:23.652 --> 03:25.414
Not as fast as Cody and Robert.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.791
In time.

03:30.062 --> 03:31.170
Special.

03:31.368 --> 03:33.857
That's what Carson said
on the dance floor,

03:33.882 --> 03:34.860
that I was special.

03:34.885 --> 03:36.267
And what did you say?

03:36.292 --> 03:38.470
I said he's special, too.

03:38.933 --> 03:40.268
Oh, what? Is that wrong?

03:40.293 --> 03:41.075
No.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.161
No, but friends are special.

03:43.186 --> 03:44.975
Colleagues are special.

03:45.962 --> 03:48.187
How did he look when he said it?

03:48.524 --> 03:50.788
He looked like... I don't know.

03:50.813 --> 03:51.775
What do you mean?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.693
Well, did he look you in the eyes?

03:54.075 --> 03:55.737
Well, yes.

03:56.056 --> 03:56.845
I think.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.854
Well. Did he wink when he said it?

03:58.879 --> 04:00.579
Rosemary, that would have
been kind of creepy.

04:00.604 --> 04:01.408
Alright, alright.

04:01.433 --> 04:02.567
But what about his body language?

04:02.592 --> 04:04.032
Did he seem kind of nervous?

04:04.057 --> 04:05.352
Or forceful?

04:05.377 --> 04:07.635
No, he seemed normal.

04:07.660 --> 04:08.673
Like Carson.

04:08.698 --> 04:09.735
Well, this is just ridiculous.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.335
You need to talk to the man.

04:11.605 --> 04:14.171
There's obviously a lot left unsaid.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.089
Talking's not my strong suit.

04:16.115 --> 04:19.134
But fortunately, it's mine.

04:20.036 --> 04:23.853
Sir Frances Drake was one of the
most famous English privateers.

04:23.878 --> 04:25.829
He claimed lands for the Monarch

04:25.854 --> 04:28.603
and engaged in battles for Spain.

04:28.807 --> 04:29.828
Yes, Robert?

04:29.853 --> 04:31.681
Are privateers the same as pirates?

04:31.706 --> 04:33.190
Not exactly.

04:33.279 --> 04:35.859
Both had private ships, or fleets,

04:35.884 --> 04:38.031
but the difference is that privateers

04:38.056 --> 04:40.735
were commissioned by monarchies.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.530
Queen Elizabeth I was so
impressed by Drake's work

04:44.555 --> 04:48.026
that he was knighted in 1581.

04:48.051 --> 04:49.524
So they don't plunder?

04:49.549 --> 04:50.850
I didn't say that.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.812
Privateers often did bad deeds, too,

04:53.875 --> 04:56.144
but they had permission to do so.

04:56.169 --> 04:57.632
Did they wear eye patches?

04:58.149 --> 05:00.509
I'm sure some of them
also wore eye patches.

05:00.545 --> 05:01.360
Alright, everyone.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.680
That is enough for this morning.

05:02.705 --> 05:03.814
Enjoy your lunch.

05:06.038 --> 05:08.225
You ready to plunder the high seas?

05:08.530 --> 05:09.894
Arrr!

05:09.919 --> 05:12.563
Guys, wait.

05:22.911 --> 05:24.241
Madam Mayor.

05:24.330 --> 05:26.243
This is a pleasant surprise.

05:26.385 --> 05:27.828
What can I get you?

05:27.906 --> 05:31.081
Well .Unfortunately, this
isn't a social visit.

05:31.725 --> 05:32.726
I see.

05:32.751 --> 05:34.414
First, let me say how happy we are

05:34.439 --> 05:36.086
that your business is doing so well.

05:36.111 --> 05:37.380
I sense a "but" coming.

05:37.418 --> 05:40.211
There are some concerns
about the hours you keep

05:40.236 --> 05:41.289
and the noise.

05:41.371 --> 05:42.205
The noise?

05:42.230 --> 05:44.227
Yes, from your patrons and the music.

05:44.252 --> 05:46.514
But I was hoping you'd
be willing to help us.

05:46.539 --> 05:47.707
What do you have in mind?

05:47.732 --> 05:50.184
Perhaps you could close by 10:00 pm.

05:50.676 --> 05:52.140
That is a little early, isn't it?

05:52.165 --> 05:54.019
Well, those are the hours that Tom kept

05:54.044 --> 05:55.555
when he was running the saloon.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.433
I- I don't think it's unfair.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.525
Ok.

05:58.615 --> 05:59.883
I'll watch the hours.

05:59.908 --> 06:01.062
And the noise.

06:01.087 --> 06:02.188
And the noise.

06:02.213 --> 06:03.782
Especially if we're not busy.

06:03.812 --> 06:05.115
Thank you.

06:05.213 --> 06:08.368
And congratulations
again on your success.

06:14.035 --> 06:14.970
<i>Wait.</i>

06:14.995 --> 06:16.000
<i>They were released?</i>

06:16.025 --> 06:18.281
I called you in Hope Valley
but you had already left.

06:18.306 --> 06:19.585
The judge dropped the charges.

06:19.610 --> 06:20.617
On what grounds?

06:20.642 --> 06:21.757
Lack of evidence.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.789
Lack of evidence?

06:22.814 --> 06:24.156
Georgia, you said this was a lock!

06:24.181 --> 06:26.428
We asked the judge to
reconsider but it was too late.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.689
He'd already freed them.

06:27.816 --> 06:29.515
No, no. Something stinks here.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.250
These two controlled half
the gunrunning operations

06:31.275 --> 06:33.269
in the Northern Territory.

06:35.501 --> 06:36.648
Bill?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.692
Bill, where are you going?

06:49.328 --> 06:52.016
Arr, the ship we're going
to attack is over there,

06:52.041 --> 06:53.044
near the island.

06:53.077 --> 06:55.147
They don't even know we're coming.

06:57.093 --> 06:58.342
Can I come on the boat now?

06:58.367 --> 06:59.984
You're doing great with the wave, Timmy.

07:00.009 --> 07:00.711
Really?

07:00.736 --> 07:02.373
Yarrr.

07:12.086 --> 07:13.434
Excuse me.

07:13.459 --> 07:15.630
Mitchell Quinn and Lance Wilcox.

07:15.951 --> 07:16.863
You released them.

07:16.888 --> 07:17.521
Why?

07:17.546 --> 07:18.546
Do I know you?

07:18.571 --> 07:19.941
I'm Sheriff Bill Avery.

07:19.966 --> 07:22.095
I've testified in your court
before and I was scheduled

07:22.120 --> 07:23.923
to testify against Quinn and Wilcox.

07:23.963 --> 07:26.134
Yes, well upon review of the evidence

07:26.159 --> 07:28.224
I found it insufficient
to take them to trial.

07:28.249 --> 07:31.091
Well, that's odd, because
the prosecutor said it was

07:31.116 --> 07:32.785
an open and shut case.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.329
Her opinion, not mine.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.278
As of two days ago you
gave every indication

07:36.303 --> 07:37.771
that you agreed with her.

07:37.863 --> 07:40.132
Are you questioning my
authority in this matter?

07:40.273 --> 07:41.629
No, judge.

07:42.011 --> 07:43.179
I'm questioning your motive.

07:43.204 --> 07:45.424
I've made my decision, sheriff.

07:46.963 --> 07:48.303
Now, you listen to me!

07:48.904 --> 07:50.959
You set free two of the worst
gunrunners we've ever seen.

07:50.984 --> 07:52.019
You'll go to jail for this!

07:52.044 --> 07:54.847
Good Mounties died bringing
these guys to justice.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.728
Now, you're gonna tell me who got to you

07:57.874 --> 08:00.397
and I'm not leaving until you do.

08:02.492 --> 08:05.485
So you-you told her she was special?

08:06.342 --> 08:07.502
Yeah.

08:07.527 --> 08:10.073
Well, what exactly did
you mean by "special"?

08:10.097 --> 08:12.739
Well, I think she's amazing,

08:12.764 --> 08:16.581
I love spending time with
her, and I'm interested.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.079
You're interested?

08:18.111 --> 08:20.841
Well, I'm not sure she's gonna
get all that from one word.

08:21.161 --> 08:24.671
There is no such thing as
too much communication.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.816
You learned that from Rosemary.

08:28.035 --> 08:30.636
Every single day, my friend.

08:31.294 --> 08:33.323
Quinn and Wilcox had one of their goons

08:33.349 --> 08:34.630
threaten Judge Southwick.

08:34.655 --> 08:36.155
That's why he threw out the case?

08:36.181 --> 08:37.520
Well, he said he had no choice.

08:37.544 --> 08:39.193
How'd you get the judge to admit it?

08:39.217 --> 08:41.511
I appealed to his, you know...

08:41.537 --> 08:43.023
Bill, did you put your hands on him?

08:43.048 --> 08:45.851
The point is that he saw
the error of his ways.

08:46.070 --> 08:47.738
He even signed an arrest warrant.

08:47.763 --> 08:48.904
And what good will that do?

08:48.945 --> 08:50.658
Quinn and Wilcox are long gone by now.

08:50.683 --> 08:51.866
But I know where they're going.

08:51.891 --> 08:53.259
The Northern Territories.

08:53.284 --> 08:54.286
They have connections up there.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.568
Less of a Mountie influence.

08:55.593 --> 08:57.364
But the Northern Territories are huge.

08:57.389 --> 08:58.341
Where would you start?

08:58.366 --> 09:00.573
The fastest way up there
is over Fintry Pass.

09:00.598 --> 09:02.989
Beyond that there's nothing
but rivers, roads, trails,

09:03.014 --> 09:04.116
and one rail line.

09:04.141 --> 09:05.443
They get there, they disappear.

09:05.468 --> 09:07.137
Fintry Pass is a dangerous ride.

09:07.162 --> 09:08.391
Even if you rode day and night

09:08.416 --> 09:10.000
they'd have a day and a half head start.

09:10.025 --> 09:11.550
Well, I'm gonna have to find a shortcut.

09:11.575 --> 09:12.496
Do you know one?

09:12.521 --> 09:13.972
No, but I know somebody who might.

09:26.293 --> 09:27.652
<i>Mom?</i>

09:28.004 --> 09:30.320
Oh, did the music wake you up again?

09:30.467 --> 09:32.824
I think it's louder than last night.

09:36.235 --> 09:37.770
Are you gonna let him have it?

09:37.795 --> 09:38.864
Go back to bed.

09:38.889 --> 09:41.416
We'll talk about it in the morning.

09:48.558 --> 09:50.806
I- I thought he agreed to
keep it down at night.

09:50.831 --> 09:51.700
He did.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.861
Apparently, he had a change of heart.

09:55.214 --> 09:57.584
Well, I'm gonna go and give
that man a piece of my mind.

09:57.609 --> 09:58.677
No need, Ned.

09:58.702 --> 10:00.693
By the look in our mayor's
eyes I'd say she's about

10:00.718 --> 10:02.821
to take care of this one herself.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.774
Your luck has to end somehow.

10:07.799 --> 10:09.477
You're probably right.

10:09.502 --> 10:11.361
<i>How about loser picks up the tab?</i>

10:11.994 --> 10:13.448
<i>Deal.</i>

10:13.967 --> 10:16.084
Woooo!

10:16.757 --> 10:18.292
Who's next?

10:27.168 --> 10:28.202
Henry.

10:28.227 --> 10:29.212
Mike.

10:29.639 --> 10:30.907
Enjoying the game?

10:30.932 --> 10:32.394
Well, I'd be enjoying it a lot more

10:32.419 --> 10:34.760
if Lucas here wasn't cleaning up.

10:35.485 --> 10:38.055
I'm not really enjoying it.

10:40.060 --> 10:41.315
Mr. Bouchard?

10:41.423 --> 10:43.698
I thought you agreed that
you would close at 10:00.

10:43.723 --> 10:46.393
No, I said I would watch the
hours if business is slow.

10:46.550 --> 10:48.816
And, as you can see, it's not.

10:49.008 --> 10:51.818
And besides, it's not as
though I'm breaking any laws.

10:52.895 --> 10:54.329
Mr. Bouchard, we're used to people

10:54.354 --> 10:56.824
keeping their word around here.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.493
Sorry.

10:59.874 --> 11:02.746
Gentlemen, full house.

11:06.351 --> 11:07.706
Would you like to join us, Mayor?

11:07.731 --> 11:09.087
We have room.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.248
No, thank you.

11:12.273 --> 11:13.882
I have an early morning.

11:14.644 --> 11:16.413
Gentlemen.

11:27.171 --> 11:29.186
Woah, whoa, whoa.

11:41.579 --> 11:42.314
Hey!

11:42.347 --> 11:43.782
Hey, don't shoot!

11:44.557 --> 11:45.826
Who's that?

11:45.851 --> 11:47.320
Jeremiah, it's me, Bill!

11:48.653 --> 11:49.655
Did you hear me?

11:49.680 --> 11:50.648
I said it's me, Bill Avery!

11:52.054 --> 11:53.188
<i>Yeah, I heard ya.</i>

11:53.213 --> 11:54.983
<i>What do you want?</i>

12:00.055 --> 12:01.391
I need your help.

12:01.463 --> 12:02.698
I need a guide.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.859
Sorry, I don't do that anymore.

12:04.893 --> 12:06.977
Well, I was hoping that
was just a rumour.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.299
I'm thinking you may
want to hear me out.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.169
I got coffee on.

12:18.114 --> 12:19.249
<i>Arr!</i>

12:19.274 --> 12:20.875
<i>Ya scurvy dogs!</i>

12:20.909 --> 12:23.044
<i>Prepare to scuttle the ship, matey!</i>

12:23.077 --> 12:25.256
<i>I'll get him to walk the plank-</i>

12:25.281 --> 12:26.883
Guys, let me be a pirate.

12:26.908 --> 12:28.958
We're gonna fight through
a storm today, Timmy.

12:28.983 --> 12:30.951
We're gonna need some big waves.

12:30.976 --> 12:31.644
Wait.

12:31.669 --> 12:33.337
Look what I got.

12:33.484 --> 12:34.485
Woah.

12:34.510 --> 12:35.477
Woah.

12:35.746 --> 12:37.344
Is that a real spyglass?

12:37.369 --> 12:38.171
Yep.

12:38.196 --> 12:39.510
Where'd you get it?

12:39.535 --> 12:41.095
It was a gift.

12:41.580 --> 12:42.722
It works, too.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.056
Can I see that?

12:48.335 --> 12:50.810
Woah, I can see all the way
to the cafe from here.

12:50.835 --> 12:52.356
Let's try it out.

12:55.540 --> 12:56.935
Well, come on, Timmy.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.571
Hop aboard.

13:05.007 --> 13:07.493
If they make it to Fintry
Pass they'll disappear.

13:07.518 --> 13:09.420
I need to know if there's a shortcut.

13:09.445 --> 13:11.041
Are you hard of hearing, Bill?

13:11.219 --> 13:12.792
I don't guide anymore.

13:13.279 --> 13:14.947
I don't get it. You're the best.

13:14.972 --> 13:17.006
That's why the Mounties
kept coming to you.

13:18.886 --> 13:20.920
Look, I know we haven't
spoken in a few years.

13:20.945 --> 13:22.246
Ten years.

13:22.278 --> 13:23.876
And I know we parted on bad terms,

13:23.901 --> 13:25.257
I just hope that's not why-

13:25.282 --> 13:26.384
Don't flatter yourself.

13:26.417 --> 13:29.187
I'm just done with it, that's all.

13:30.990 --> 13:32.531
It's Mitchell Quinn and Lance Wilcox.

13:32.556 --> 13:33.456
The gunrunners.

13:33.490 --> 13:35.022
That's who we're chasing.

13:35.047 --> 13:36.859
You know the names?

13:37.561 --> 13:39.062
Then you know their reputations.

13:39.096 --> 13:40.613
That's why I need your help.

13:40.638 --> 13:41.201
Look, Bill-

13:41.226 --> 13:42.214
Jeremiah.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.239
A lot of good Mounties chased
these guys into all corners

13:44.264 --> 13:47.154
of the Northern Territories, and
some didn't make it back home.

13:47.179 --> 13:48.451
Are you trying to guilt me into this?

13:48.476 --> 13:50.330
Whatever it takes.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.260
Hold on.

14:06.624 --> 14:08.326
There is a shortcut.

14:08.359 --> 14:12.584
It's not pretty, but we might
be able to head 'em off.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.973
The cut's not that deep.

14:21.998 --> 14:22.978
You're lucky.

14:23.003 --> 14:24.104
It's my fault.

14:24.415 --> 14:26.910
I thought the sawyer knew I
was pulling that scrap wood

14:26.943 --> 14:27.745
off the conveyor.

14:27.778 --> 14:28.852
I guess I didn't yell loud enough.

14:28.877 --> 14:30.345
Yeah, he must not have heard you.

14:30.582 --> 14:31.415
Perhaps.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.975
Or maybe it wasn't clear what he said.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.269
Because sometimes words
can be confusing.

14:35.467 --> 14:36.617
Don't you think?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.327
I think he thought he was
being clear, though.

14:39.352 --> 14:40.220
But he wasn't.

14:40.245 --> 14:41.689
Look at him. He's lucky.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.948
It could have been much worse.

14:42.973 --> 14:44.740
I think he wishes he
was clearer, though.

14:44.765 --> 14:45.689
Don't you, Mike?

14:45.714 --> 14:46.212
Uh, I...

14:46.237 --> 14:49.056
Wishing doesn't make
it so, won't you say?

14:49.081 --> 14:50.182
Mike?

14:51.348 --> 14:52.884
Yes?

14:57.049 --> 14:59.501
He looked me in the eye and
said he would cooperate.

14:59.526 --> 15:00.761
I took him at his word.

15:00.786 --> 15:03.323
Well, at least now you know the
kind of man you're dealing with.

15:03.348 --> 15:05.084
I expected more from Lucas.

15:05.109 --> 15:06.656
I thought he was a gentleman.

15:06.681 --> 15:08.241
I've met charmers like him before.

15:08.266 --> 15:09.835
They give a wonderful presentation

15:09.860 --> 15:11.929
but the flower soon withers on the vine.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.114
I don't know what to do about it.

15:13.139 --> 15:15.181
After his renovations
and grand re-opening

15:15.206 --> 15:17.326
a lot of people love the new saloon.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.423
Some think it's a nuisance.

15:19.448 --> 15:22.005
He believes the law is on
his side and he's right.

15:22.176 --> 15:24.674
He doesn't have to be so smug about it.

15:25.283 --> 15:27.595
You know, he is a gambler.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.889
Why not call his bluff?

15:46.466 --> 15:48.535
Where's this shortcut of yours?

15:48.560 --> 15:50.228
Uh, up ahead.

15:51.270 --> 15:52.869
You don't sound very sure.

15:53.045 --> 15:54.781
Well, I never actually saw it myself.

15:54.806 --> 15:57.051
My dad told me about
it when I was a kid.

15:57.076 --> 15:58.887
You've never seen it with your own eyes?

15:58.912 --> 15:59.887
It's getting late.

15:59.912 --> 16:01.643
I don't wanna ride over
a mountain in the dark.

16:01.668 --> 16:04.251
We're not going over a mountain,
we're going through it.

16:04.284 --> 16:05.434
How?

16:05.731 --> 16:07.259
An abandoned mine.

16:07.602 --> 16:10.272
A bunch of tunnels that branch off

16:10.297 --> 16:12.399
and one of them leads to the
other side of the mountain.

16:12.424 --> 16:14.262
Where do the others lead?

16:14.287 --> 16:16.894
Probably to our death. Hup.

16:20.031 --> 16:21.023
Hiya!

16:26.633 --> 16:28.571
Excuse me for a moment.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.413
May I ask what you're doing?

16:38.658 --> 16:41.094
You made a very good point last night.

16:41.119 --> 16:43.455
There are no laws that
restrict your hours.

16:43.481 --> 16:46.381
So the town council
plans to address that.

16:49.396 --> 16:50.927
Is this a joke?

16:51.322 --> 16:52.929
Oh, no. Not at all.

16:52.954 --> 16:54.932
The meeting is open to the public.

16:55.244 --> 16:57.347
We hope you'll join us.

17:03.601 --> 17:05.858
You still haven't talked to Carson?

17:06.080 --> 17:07.861
Well, not exactly.

17:07.977 --> 17:09.529
We've talked around it.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.089
I think you're gonna
have to be more direct.

17:12.208 --> 17:15.544
Men often approach romance
as they would a bear,

17:15.569 --> 17:18.981
thinking if they just play
dead it won't disturb them.

17:19.006 --> 17:19.973
Hmm.

17:19.999 --> 17:22.535
That doesn't really sound
like Carson to me.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.348
Well, maybe you two are too much alike.

17:25.373 --> 17:27.381
A couple of pragmatists.

17:27.406 --> 17:30.175
Very good in medicine,
not so good in love.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.403
Just try not to think
about the negative.

17:32.428 --> 17:33.486
That'll get you nowhere.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.245
Ok.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.005
Mmmhmm.

17:35.030 --> 17:38.012
Of course, workplace romances
are fraught with challenges,

17:38.037 --> 17:39.037
to say the least.

17:39.062 --> 17:39.601
Right.

17:39.626 --> 17:40.520
And if it doesn't work out-

17:40.545 --> 17:43.438
I mean, of course it
will, but if it doesn't,

17:43.662 --> 17:46.442
that could make things very difficult.

17:46.742 --> 17:48.511
Let's hope that doesn't happen.

17:48.536 --> 17:49.520
Of course not.

17:49.545 --> 17:51.546
But if it does-I once
worked with this actress

17:51.571 --> 17:54.032
who had a romance with the director.

17:54.057 --> 17:55.818
It ended very badly.

17:55.843 --> 17:56.827
Oh.

17:57.318 --> 17:58.854
Well, what happened?

17:58.879 --> 18:01.294
Oh, you don't wanna know.

18:01.319 --> 18:03.042
Needless to say the
production was halted

18:03.067 --> 18:05.002
and they never spoke again.

18:05.027 --> 18:08.297
Aren't you glad you don't
have to worry about all that?

18:09.316 --> 18:11.925
Tomorrow let's play
privateers versus pirates.

18:12.199 --> 18:14.802
Cody and I will be privateers,
you can be a pirate.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.978
Remember your eye patch.

18:16.003 --> 18:17.004
Ok.

18:17.029 --> 18:17.800
Gotta go.

18:17.825 --> 18:18.536
Wait.

18:18.561 --> 18:20.099
Can I have my spyglass back?

18:20.348 --> 18:21.416
I thought you had it.

18:21.441 --> 18:22.675
You had it the whole time.

18:22.700 --> 18:23.747
Do you have it?

18:23.772 --> 18:25.100
No, you had it.

18:25.125 --> 18:26.393
Where is it then?

18:26.418 --> 18:28.149
I must have left it by the pond.

18:28.174 --> 18:29.542
We can get it tomorrow.

18:29.567 --> 18:30.819
See ya.

18:45.512 --> 18:46.778
Thank you.

18:47.733 --> 18:51.090
I didn't expect Mayor Stanton
to take it so personally.

18:51.277 --> 18:53.676
She takes her job seriously.

18:53.862 --> 18:55.302
So do I.

18:55.454 --> 18:57.930
There's nothing wrong with
people having some harmless fun.

18:58.518 --> 19:00.458
The place is busy for a reason.

19:00.483 --> 19:03.160
Well, you won't get any
argument from me about it.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.120
I mean, I always thought
that Tom ran this place

19:05.152 --> 19:07.271
like a nunnery.

19:08.829 --> 19:13.362
If Abigail thinks I'm gonna
roll over she is mistaken.

19:14.017 --> 19:17.699
Well, underestimate our
mayor at your peril.

19:20.295 --> 19:24.747
She has an annoying tendency
of getting her way.

19:27.631 --> 19:29.455
Hi, smiley.

19:32.060 --> 19:37.219
Now, I have someone very special
that I want you to meet.

19:37.682 --> 19:39.018
Yeah.

19:41.450 --> 19:43.286
Look who it is.

19:44.763 --> 19:48.132
Sergeant, I'd like you to meet Jack.

19:48.322 --> 19:52.275
Now, Sergeant was your daddy's
horse when he was a Mountie,

19:52.959 --> 19:55.611
and he was very important to your daddy,

19:56.071 --> 19:59.450
which is how I know he would
want him to be yours.

19:59.904 --> 20:03.778
<i>So one day, in a few years,
when you're big enough to ride,</i>

20:03.803 --> 20:05.914
Sergeant will be your horse.

20:06.825 --> 20:10.252
Until then I will take very
good care of him for you.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.255
You miss Jack, don't you?

20:15.461 --> 20:21.096
I promise one day his son
will be your best friend.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.476
Alright.

20:27.173 --> 20:28.936
Thank you, Laura.

20:29.134 --> 20:30.606
Be back soon.

20:30.631 --> 20:33.232
Hi baby, hello.

20:36.865 --> 20:39.322
Come on, this way.

20:45.232 --> 20:46.234
See you soon.

20:46.259 --> 20:47.929
Come on.

21:25.107 --> 21:26.375
Whoa.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.701
Timmy.

21:29.473 --> 21:30.825
Whoa.

21:30.850 --> 21:32.085
Hi.

21:34.153 --> 21:35.722
What're you doing out here, buddy?

21:35.747 --> 21:37.284
Looking for my spyglass.

21:37.309 --> 21:38.173
Your spyglass?

21:38.206 --> 21:39.091
What happened to it?

21:39.116 --> 21:41.368
I brought it to play pirates
with Robert and Cody.

21:41.393 --> 21:42.060
<i>Mmmhmm.</i>

21:42.085 --> 21:42.989
It's a real one.

21:43.014 --> 21:44.304
A gift from my grandpa.

21:44.329 --> 21:44.971
Oh.

21:44.996 --> 21:48.141
Robert and Cody lost it and
now I can't find it anywhere.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.451
Well, if they lost it

21:50.476 --> 21:52.450
why aren't they out here
helping you look for it?

21:52.475 --> 21:54.536
I don't know.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.644
Timmy, I can tell that you
want to be their friend

21:58.684 --> 22:01.779
but friendship is
really a two-way street

22:02.320 --> 22:03.989
and that means that
they should be out here

22:04.014 --> 22:05.741
helping you look.

22:08.213 --> 22:09.912
You know what I think?

22:10.077 --> 22:12.394
I think that if you
stand up to these boys

22:12.419 --> 22:14.188
they will respect you for it.

22:14.221 --> 22:16.003
What if they don't?

22:16.719 --> 22:19.965
Then they have missed out
on a wonderful friend.

22:33.661 --> 22:34.604
Is this it?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.156
Pretty sure.

22:36.291 --> 22:38.159
Come on, we got a long walk ahead of us.

22:38.184 --> 22:39.285
What about the horses?

22:39.310 --> 22:40.477
They'll be fine.

22:40.575 --> 22:41.872
The trail to the Northern Territories

22:41.897 --> 22:43.317
heads over the mountain.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.801
By going through it, might give
us enough time to head them off.

22:46.826 --> 22:47.994
Might?

22:49.679 --> 22:51.916
These old mines aren't very stable.

22:51.941 --> 22:54.332
No, they're not.

23:00.153 --> 23:02.049
Elizabeth, this is delicious.

23:02.074 --> 23:03.219
It really is.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.837
This is the best chicken
I have had in ages.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.231
It's pork.

23:11.699 --> 23:13.000
Mmm.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.065
Yes, you're right.

23:14.090 --> 23:16.564
Well, it's the best pork
I've had in a long time.

23:16.589 --> 23:19.268
And can I just say thank you so
much for having us over tonight.

23:19.293 --> 23:20.971
It is the very least I can do.

23:20.996 --> 23:22.916
You all have done so much
for baby Jack and me

23:22.941 --> 23:24.041
and I just want you to know

23:24.066 --> 23:25.803
how much I appreciate all of you.

23:25.924 --> 23:27.726
We're a family and that's
what we do for each other,

23:27.751 --> 23:29.260
no matter what the challenge.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.525
Speaking of challenges

23:30.550 --> 23:32.283
I hear you're taking on the saloon.

23:32.308 --> 23:33.807
Well, I'm not taking on the saloon

23:33.832 --> 23:36.248
but the town council is
considering a new law.

23:36.273 --> 23:38.120
Well, you have two town
council members right here

23:38.145 --> 23:39.246
at this table.

23:39.271 --> 23:41.408
I'd say we have a rather
sizeable elephant in the room.

23:41.433 --> 23:43.048
Rosie, don't.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.518
What? It's as Abigail
said, we're all family,

23:44.543 --> 23:46.045
there are no secrets.

23:46.070 --> 23:47.500
I trust Abigail's judgement.

23:47.525 --> 23:49.088
No one has the interests
of this town at heart

23:49.113 --> 23:50.048
more than she does.

23:50.098 --> 23:51.533
Exactly, and I know Lee
feels the same way,

23:51.558 --> 23:52.848
don't you, Lee?

23:52.905 --> 23:55.416
Mmm, is that garlic in
these mashed potatoes?

23:55.468 --> 23:56.565
Mmmhmm.

23:56.590 --> 23:57.721
Very funny.

23:57.746 --> 23:59.856
Now tell Abigail you support her.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.069
No, no, no, no, no.

24:04.101 --> 24:04.635
Stay.

24:04.660 --> 24:05.829
It's my turn, please.

24:05.854 --> 24:07.446
You just keep eating.

24:08.087 --> 24:09.821
Hello there.

24:09.846 --> 24:11.576
Are you making a fuss?

24:11.601 --> 24:13.369
Come here, little guy.

24:13.394 --> 24:15.663
Ohhh. Hello.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.528
Hi.

24:17.553 --> 24:18.940
Hello.

24:19.694 --> 24:22.169
He's so good with the baby.

24:22.194 --> 24:25.423
Come here, you.

24:28.301 --> 24:31.178
Yes, Lee would make a wonderful father.

24:40.342 --> 24:43.012
This isn't how my dad described it.

24:43.037 --> 24:44.105
Great.

24:44.130 --> 24:45.308
Not only are we running out of time,

24:45.333 --> 24:46.620
we're in the wrong mine.

24:46.645 --> 24:48.347
Maybe I made a wrong turn back there.

24:48.372 --> 24:49.769
This is insane.

24:49.918 --> 24:51.419
I think we should turn back.

24:51.444 --> 24:53.542
You head back now you'll miss
your chance at heading off

24:53.567 --> 24:54.535
those gunrunners.

24:54.829 --> 24:56.456
Well, if I keep going
I may miss the chance

24:56.481 --> 24:58.289
of ever seeing daylight again.

24:58.526 --> 25:01.709
Now, for the last time, is
this the right way or not?

25:02.393 --> 25:03.961
I think so.

25:05.561 --> 25:07.131
That's not good enough.

25:08.192 --> 25:09.635
I'm heading back.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.597
First you shoot at me,

25:33.630 --> 25:35.666
then you tell me you've
never actually laid eyes

25:35.700 --> 25:38.080
on this shortcut we're trying to find.

25:38.455 --> 25:39.879
Now you got me so far underground

25:39.904 --> 25:41.772
I don't even know which way is up.

25:41.806 --> 25:45.573
Need I remind you I was in my
cabin minding my own business.

25:45.839 --> 25:47.089
You came to me.

25:47.384 --> 25:49.256
I should have shot you on sight.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.777
Don't flatter yourself.

25:50.802 --> 25:52.804
You never could shoot straight.

25:56.728 --> 25:59.152
That was a perfect evening.

25:59.226 --> 26:01.222
Yes, it was.

26:01.336 --> 26:04.105
So nice to see Elizabeth happy again.

26:04.224 --> 26:05.292
Yeah.

26:05.317 --> 26:07.519
And little Jack is a beautiful baby.

26:07.890 --> 26:09.111
Yeah, he is.

26:10.023 --> 26:11.759
Beautiful baby boy.

26:11.784 --> 26:13.110
Rosie?

26:13.935 --> 26:15.367
Hey.

26:16.389 --> 26:19.036
Uh, I'm tired.

26:21.004 --> 26:22.706
I'm gonna turn in early.

26:24.229 --> 26:25.798
Ok.

26:47.925 --> 26:49.027
Which way?

26:49.052 --> 26:50.688
I don't know.

26:50.744 --> 26:52.154
Hey.

26:52.540 --> 26:54.781
When are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

26:55.272 --> 26:56.774
It's like you're not who you were.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.325
Like you're uncertain of everything.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.863
Jerry, we've known each
other how long, 20 years?

27:02.021 --> 27:03.924
You can talk to me.

27:08.305 --> 27:09.874
Danny Hendershot.

27:09.899 --> 27:10.867
What about him?

27:10.892 --> 27:12.407
He was our last job together.

27:12.432 --> 27:14.657
I remember, up in the plateau country.

27:14.682 --> 27:17.305
And you also remember I
got us turned around.

27:17.477 --> 27:18.977
He got away.

27:19.223 --> 27:20.525
It was my fault.

27:20.550 --> 27:21.749
It was the dead of winter.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.876
The wind and snow were
blowing us off our horses.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.411
It was an impossible job.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.219
That's not what you said at the time.

27:27.244 --> 27:28.857
Frustration makes a man say things.

27:28.882 --> 27:30.609
I should have apologized.

27:31.606 --> 27:32.774
Still.

27:32.886 --> 27:36.222
It doesn't change the fact that
I let a murderer get away.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.053
And that was my last job.

27:38.078 --> 27:39.530
Jerry.

27:39.807 --> 27:42.746
I got Hendershot four months later.

27:43.238 --> 27:44.172
You did?

27:44.197 --> 27:45.303
Yeah.

27:45.355 --> 27:47.925
We weren't really speaking but I
thought you'd heard about it.

27:47.990 --> 27:51.546
He's doing 25 to life in
Granville Penitentiary.

27:53.032 --> 27:54.424
You can let it go.

27:59.175 --> 28:03.308
Well, I got a one in three chance.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.119
I'll try this way.

28:07.771 --> 28:09.140
Wait.

28:18.590 --> 28:19.962
Good morning.

28:20.086 --> 28:21.534
Good morning.

28:22.210 --> 28:25.480
There's not many appointments
today, let's see.

28:25.653 --> 28:28.055
We have a couple of monthly check ups.

28:28.080 --> 28:32.360
Mrs. Tibbits is coming in
to renew her prescription.

28:32.421 --> 28:34.102
Oh, and Mrs. Parsons is coming by

28:34.127 --> 28:36.500
with her son to have
his stitches removed.

28:36.525 --> 28:38.437
So here you go, today's charts.

28:38.462 --> 28:40.039
I just have to pick up an
order at the mercantile.

28:40.064 --> 28:41.200
Faith?

28:42.357 --> 28:44.439
Why are we pretending that what
we said on the dance floor

28:44.464 --> 28:45.809
didn't mean anything?

28:47.682 --> 28:48.884
You're not playing dead.

28:48.909 --> 28:50.043
Excuse me?

28:50.170 --> 28:51.355
Nothing.

28:51.545 --> 28:52.779
I'm not good at this.

28:52.804 --> 28:55.151
Maybe I didn't use the right words or...

28:55.397 --> 28:57.028
or didn't use enough.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.303
What I meant when I
said you were special

28:59.328 --> 29:02.274
was nobody means more to me than you do.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.696
And I've felt that way
for quite a while.

29:04.721 --> 29:06.788
I just didn't know what to do about it.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.168
I felt it, too.

29:09.382 --> 29:11.918
But I think the reason
we didn't do anything

29:12.375 --> 29:15.664
is because we knew how terrible
it would be if it falls apart.

29:15.742 --> 29:16.810
It's a risk.

29:16.904 --> 29:17.814
A big one.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.968
I could end up embarrassed
and heartbroken.

29:21.949 --> 29:27.433
It's scary and it's crazy but
I'm willing to take a risk.

29:28.871 --> 29:30.592
I don't know if I am.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.000
There's just so much to lose.

29:33.025 --> 29:35.733
I can't-I'm sorry, Carson.

29:45.019 --> 29:47.061
Are you appealing to a higher authority?

29:47.086 --> 29:48.288
Shh.

29:49.140 --> 29:51.833
This is a trick my dad taught me.

29:51.949 --> 29:54.502
Watch the smoke.

29:55.813 --> 29:57.882
What am I looking for?

30:09.948 --> 30:11.289
Smoke goes that way,

30:11.383 --> 30:13.353
which means wind is coming
from the other direction

30:13.378 --> 30:15.606
and when there's wind there's daylight.

30:15.878 --> 30:17.981
That's our way out.

30:22.650 --> 30:24.422
Ok, Watson.

30:24.447 --> 30:25.726
A package from Valemount.

30:25.751 --> 30:27.446
There you are.

30:27.943 --> 30:31.038
And special delivery from Hamilton.

30:31.781 --> 30:32.949
One thing I miss about the city,

30:32.974 --> 30:36.096
the postal service delivers
packages right to your door.

30:36.121 --> 30:37.415
That must be nice.

30:37.691 --> 30:39.089
What're you expecting?

30:39.114 --> 30:40.049
Let me guess.

30:40.074 --> 30:41.564
A pair of fabulous new
shoes from that shop

30:41.589 --> 30:43.058
you've talked about.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.986
Just a replacement handset
from my head office.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.280
Mmmhmm.

30:47.305 --> 30:48.681
Oh, hush.

30:48.778 --> 30:50.146
What're you expecting?

30:50.171 --> 30:51.642
Some delicate French lace.

30:52.071 --> 30:53.394
You win.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.409
I'm waiting for a package
from San Francisco,

30:55.434 --> 30:56.235
did it come in?

30:56.260 --> 30:58.274
Yes, it is right there.

30:58.488 --> 31:01.091
Oh, and if you see Mr. Bouchard
can you tell him that his uh,

31:01.116 --> 31:02.484
his trunk arrived?

31:02.564 --> 31:04.600
Why do you think I'd see Mr. Bouchard?

31:04.625 --> 31:06.450
Just assuming.

31:06.475 --> 31:08.284
I've seen you in the saloon.

31:08.537 --> 31:10.039
I've seen you there, too.

31:10.064 --> 31:11.735
Yeah, not since the grand opening.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.761
It's a little loud for my taste.

31:13.786 --> 31:14.749
<i>Mmm.</i>

31:14.774 --> 31:17.042
That's the sound of people
having a good time.

31:17.713 --> 31:19.899
Yeah, well, there is a
time for everything.

31:19.924 --> 31:21.672
The town council's meeting about it.

31:22.192 --> 31:23.757
You should stop by.

31:24.103 --> 31:25.773
Maybe I will.

31:37.717 --> 31:38.898
What is it?

31:39.072 --> 31:40.474
Oh, nothing.

31:40.499 --> 31:44.153
It's... just a nice
trunk, wouldn't you say?

31:50.658 --> 31:51.927
Here you are.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.835
What'd I tell ya?

32:00.735 --> 32:02.796
They're probably gone by now.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.165
Maybe not.

32:13.523 --> 32:14.684
It's them.

32:15.580 --> 32:16.915
You stay here.

32:16.940 --> 32:17.975
I could come along.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.803
Not necessary.

32:27.078 --> 32:27.979
Hey, Timmy.

32:28.004 --> 32:29.507
Grab your glove.

32:30.599 --> 32:33.602
We're playing pirates later so
don't forget your spyglass.

32:38.061 --> 32:39.463
You lost it, remember?

32:39.488 --> 32:41.157
I just wanted to be your friend.

32:41.182 --> 32:43.952
I might not be as big
as you or as funny,

32:43.977 --> 32:47.592
but if you lost that ball I'd
be helping you look for it.

33:00.025 --> 33:01.521
<i>Let's get a move on, Mitchell.</i>

33:01.546 --> 33:02.732
It's a long ride.

33:02.757 --> 33:03.941
What's the hurry?

33:03.966 --> 33:04.934
Sheriff Bill Avery.

33:04.959 --> 33:05.906
You're under arrest.

33:05.931 --> 33:07.126
For what?

33:07.151 --> 33:08.641
Judge dropped the charges.

33:08.666 --> 33:09.446
Well, I got a warrant on me

33:09.471 --> 33:12.602
for the original charges
plus one additional.

33:12.722 --> 33:13.822
Threatening a judge.

33:13.847 --> 33:17.384
Now slowly throw your guns over there.

33:17.651 --> 33:18.818
I don't think so.

33:18.843 --> 33:20.479
Drop the rifle, sheriff.

33:26.914 --> 33:29.084
That judge didn't see
me coming, neither.

33:30.953 --> 33:32.822
I always say you show
me a man ain't got eyes

33:32.847 --> 33:35.017
in the back of his head I'll show you-

33:48.121 --> 33:50.704
If you ask me this council
meeting is long overdue.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.132
Well, I like to have a good
time as much as the next person

33:53.157 --> 33:55.627
but I also like it quiet
when I go to sleep at night.

33:56.056 --> 33:58.311
I'm sorry, I know you
work there, but still.

33:58.336 --> 34:01.036
If you ask me, Bouchard is due
for a helping of humble pie.

34:01.061 --> 34:02.874
What is it about small towns?

34:02.899 --> 34:04.753
Can't people have a place to relax

34:04.778 --> 34:06.545
and have some harmless fun?

34:06.780 --> 34:09.007
Our doors are open late,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:09.032 --> 34:11.507
Half price refreshments after 10:00pm.

34:11.541 --> 34:12.801
Can't beat that.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.186
Feel free to tell your elected officials

34:15.210 --> 34:18.181
my saloon is not the plague
they claim it to be.

34:18.612 --> 34:21.226
Gentlemen, good to see you.

34:28.562 --> 34:30.570
Well, that's not exactly fair.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.821
The man is used to winning.

34:33.074 --> 34:36.244
That's because he hasn't
gone up against you before.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.936
This mean you're coming
out of retirement?

34:44.960 --> 34:46.293
Maybe.

34:46.714 --> 34:47.681
You should.

34:47.706 --> 34:48.657
My cabin's this way.

34:48.681 --> 34:50.338
You sure you can find your way back?

34:50.362 --> 34:51.674
Funny.

34:52.043 --> 34:52.813
Jeremiah?

34:52.839 --> 34:53.322
Yeah?

34:53.348 --> 34:54.213
I owe you one.

34:54.237 --> 34:55.844
I'd say we're even.

34:56.340 --> 34:57.680
Settle in, boys.

34:57.705 --> 35:00.042
It's a long ride to jail.

35:05.656 --> 35:06.781
Uh, Ned?

35:06.806 --> 35:07.937
We're ready to start.

35:07.962 --> 35:08.866
Very good.

35:08.891 --> 35:09.926
Alright.

35:09.951 --> 35:13.321
The first item on today's
agenda was supposed to be

35:13.346 --> 35:16.944
Elizabeth's proposal for
a new town library,

35:16.969 --> 35:20.405
however, seeing as most of you
are not here for that reason

35:20.430 --> 35:21.999
Elizabeth has very graciously agreed

35:22.024 --> 35:25.159
to postpone that discussion
until our next meeting.

35:25.184 --> 35:26.944
Therefore, let's get right into it.

35:26.969 --> 35:29.936
A vote on the proposed town ordinance

35:29.961 --> 35:35.366
<i>which states all Hope Valley
businesses must close by 10:00pm.</i>

35:35.777 --> 35:37.094
Madam Mayor.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.037
Is the council prepared to vote?

35:39.062 --> 35:40.163
Hmmhmm.

35:40.188 --> 35:41.123
Very well.

35:41.148 --> 35:42.249
All those in favour.

35:42.274 --> 35:42.976
Aye.

35:43.001 --> 35:43.840
Aye.

35:43.865 --> 35:44.937
Aye.

35:45.241 --> 35:46.544
All those opposed.

35:49.999 --> 35:51.609
Lee!

35:53.248 --> 35:56.985
I'm sorry, Abigail, but my men,
they really love the saloon.

35:57.010 --> 35:58.449
Sometimes I work late.

35:58.474 --> 35:59.867
I like to have a beer after a hard day.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.627
You don't have to explain yourselves.

36:01.652 --> 36:02.686
That's why we vote.

36:02.711 --> 36:04.581
The council is split four-four.

36:04.606 --> 36:06.958
As mayor your vote breaks the tie.

36:10.436 --> 36:14.632
I'd like to ask Mr.
Bouchard to step forward.

36:19.746 --> 36:22.581
Mr. Bouchard, what you'll find

36:22.606 --> 36:25.017
the more time you spend in Hope Valley,

36:25.296 --> 36:29.438
is the people here support
rather than divide each other

36:30.378 --> 36:33.583
and while your saloon
is a big hit in town,

36:33.608 --> 36:36.736
I think you can see that
not everyone is happy.

36:38.060 --> 36:41.783
So rather than voting I'd like to know

36:41.808 --> 36:43.952
if you're willing to compromise.

36:44.991 --> 36:48.875
I propose that you stay open
late two nights per week.

36:49.915 --> 36:51.669
What do you say?

36:51.877 --> 36:54.589
I assume three nights would
be out of the question?

36:54.677 --> 36:56.298
You would assume right.

36:59.070 --> 37:01.304
In that case we have a deal.

37:02.202 --> 37:03.148
Very good.

37:03.173 --> 37:03.811
Here, here.

37:04.796 --> 37:06.683
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

37:06.708 --> 37:08.852
This meeting is over.

37:18.488 --> 37:20.196
We should get going.

37:20.457 --> 37:21.507
Where to?

37:21.532 --> 37:22.534
House calls.

37:22.566 --> 37:23.575
Today?

37:23.731 --> 37:25.545
I thought we were doing
those on Thursday.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.106
No, I had to change it.

37:27.131 --> 37:28.748
We have to do it today.

37:28.824 --> 37:29.859
Alright.

37:29.884 --> 37:31.752
I'll pack your medical bag.

37:31.911 --> 37:32.957
Be ready in ten minutes.

37:32.982 --> 37:33.613
Ok. Great.

37:33.638 --> 37:35.140
I'll get the wagon.

37:49.246 --> 37:51.353
Madam Mayor?

37:51.656 --> 37:52.957
Let me guess.

37:52.982 --> 37:55.024
This was your plan all along.

37:55.617 --> 37:58.693
Well, I had a sense of
how the vote might go,

37:58.939 --> 38:00.510
but I wanted to give you an opportunity

38:00.535 --> 38:02.370
to do what was right.

38:05.588 --> 38:07.771
You know, when I first arrived here,

38:07.796 --> 38:10.121
the people told me that
Hope Valley was different.

38:11.275 --> 38:12.958
Today you proved they're right.

38:13.394 --> 38:15.294
We take care of our own.

38:16.104 --> 38:18.255
And that includes you now.

38:27.768 --> 38:30.274
Henry Gowen, do I detect a smile?

38:30.299 --> 38:32.270
It's not a crime now, is it?

38:33.570 --> 38:36.297
No, but you had become
so chummy with Lucas

38:36.322 --> 38:38.358
I thought you'd be on his side.

38:38.918 --> 38:41.278
Well, friends reveal themselves.

38:41.546 --> 38:45.157
I don't go looking for friends,
I look for opportunities.

38:45.603 --> 38:47.038
And you see one in Lucas?

38:47.063 --> 38:48.965
Your words, not mine.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.332
You did real good today, Abigail.

38:54.305 --> 38:55.918
Thank you, Henry.

38:56.606 --> 38:58.378
Afternoon.

39:09.468 --> 39:11.003
Come on, boy.

39:15.217 --> 39:16.695
Carson, stop.

39:16.720 --> 39:17.560
Why? What is it?

39:17.585 --> 39:19.086
Carson, please, just stop.

39:19.111 --> 39:21.485
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

39:21.822 --> 39:23.779
Is everything ok?

39:26.043 --> 39:28.451
I have to say something before
I talk myself out of it.

39:28.846 --> 39:30.102
Ok.

39:31.093 --> 39:32.129
Yes.

39:32.414 --> 39:33.208
Yes.

39:33.233 --> 39:34.774
To taking a risk.

39:35.060 --> 39:37.751
Yes to opening myself up.

39:38.023 --> 39:40.630
Yes to scary and crazy.

39:41.024 --> 39:44.395
Yes to the possibility of you and me.

39:44.420 --> 39:45.455
Yes.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.148
Yes!

39:51.213 --> 39:53.115
Um... this is where you say something.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.477
Yes.

39:55.315 --> 39:57.438
I'm actually kind of relieved.

39:59.182 --> 40:03.568
Otherwise all of this
food goes to waste.

40:04.642 --> 40:06.239
Oh, Carson.

40:22.272 --> 40:25.015
I can't find the spyglass anywhere.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.878
I'm sure it's out here somewhere.

40:26.903 --> 40:29.394
It just might take a bit
of time to find it.

40:30.555 --> 40:32.328
Timmy, I'm really proud of you

40:32.353 --> 40:34.308
for standing up to Cody and Robert.

40:34.919 --> 40:37.388
I guess I have to find new friends now.

40:39.981 --> 40:41.899
Are you sure about that?

40:42.800 --> 40:45.858
Ok. Everyone spread out
and start looking.

40:50.246 --> 40:51.382
Sorry.

40:51.787 --> 40:53.077
That's ok.

40:54.931 --> 40:56.747
Come on. Let's find it.
