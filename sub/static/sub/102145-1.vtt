M_I_SForEver

06:35.150 --> 06:36.617
Morning, Diego.

06:41.384 --> 06:43.350
...is actually gonna
testify live at the hearing,

06:43.484 --> 06:45.450
versus, for example,
being submitted by deposition testament.

06:45.584 --> 06:46.984
Hey.

06:47.117 --> 06:49.617
In terms of the briefing schedule,
we just annotated it for you.

06:49.751 --> 06:51.417
Copy of the case file?

06:51.551 --> 06:53.918
We propose to exchange exhibit
lists by the end of the month.

06:54.050 --> 06:55.817
Are you sitting in?

06:57.317 --> 06:59.551
Are you gonna join the case?
We'd be lucky to have you.

06:59.684 --> 07:02.018
Plaintiff's been all over
the news this morning.

07:02.150 --> 07:03.150
Yeah, we expected that.

07:03.284 --> 07:05.050
I mean, he's not rattled.

07:05.183 --> 07:06.984
The airlines want to make it
a PR campaign,

07:07.117 --> 07:08.751
but we'll beat 'em in court.

07:09.851 --> 07:11.450
We'll see.

07:18.284 --> 07:22.018
You're too quick.
I was hoping to buy you lunch.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.684
Go on. Get in line.
I recommend the asada.

07:24.951 --> 07:26.183
Nah.

07:28.284 --> 07:31.083
So... how's Bill?

07:31.751 --> 07:34.517
- Separated.
- Oh, sorry.

07:34.651 --> 07:35.918
So was he.

07:36.050 --> 07:38.417
What can I do for you?

07:38.551 --> 07:42.450
Last week, in Paris, a lawyer from
Mauritania approached my firm.

07:42.584 --> 07:44.050
Mauritania?

07:44.183 --> 07:45.384
Northwest Africa.

07:45.517 --> 07:48.018
The lawyer represents
a family over there.

07:48.150 --> 07:52.717
In November 2001, their son was taken
for questioning by Mauritanian police.

07:52.851 --> 07:54.450
He disappeared.

07:54.584 --> 07:57.450
For three years,
they don't know if he's dead, in prison.

07:57.584 --> 07:59.050
They don't know.
No one knows.

07:59.183 --> 08:01.018
And then, a few weeks ago,

08:01.150 --> 08:05.284
<i>Der Spiegel</i> writes a story saying
that he's detained in Guantánamo Bay.

08:05.417 --> 08:09.350
They say he's one of
the organizers of 9/11.

08:09.884 --> 08:11.751
- Is he?
- I don't know.

08:11.884 --> 08:13.217
I haven't spoken with him.

08:13.350 --> 08:15.817
Guantánamo will not even
confirm that he's there.

08:17.551 --> 08:20.083
I don't have
a security clearance.

08:20.217 --> 08:22.350
The firm
won't take a Gitmo case.

08:22.484 --> 08:25.317
Since when do you care
about what the firm thinks?

08:25.450 --> 08:28.517
And you still have your
clearance from your NSA suit, no?

08:28.651 --> 08:34.049
Come on. One phone call,
to see if he's there.

08:36.217 --> 08:38.583
Prisoner,
what's his name?

08:40.116 --> 08:44.082
Slahi. S-L-A-H-I.

08:44.217 --> 08:46.517
First name: Mohamedou.

08:46.651 --> 08:51.150
No, no, no. Not "Mohammed."
Mohamedou. Check the logs.

08:52.951 --> 08:56.450
Well, he's not there or you don't
know whether he's not there?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.551
All right, I'll hold.

08:59.617 --> 09:00.684
Goranson?

09:01.684 --> 09:02.717
Airlines.

09:02.851 --> 09:04.617
Oh, yeah. It's over there.

09:04.751 --> 09:08.684
But it's your facility,
so how do you not know who you're holding?

09:10.851 --> 09:11.918
"He's not not there"?

09:12.050 --> 09:14.150
What does that mean?

09:14.284 --> 09:17.317
I mean, he's not Schrodinger's cat.
He's either there or he's not there.

09:17.450 --> 09:21.450
You wanna represent
the head recruiter for 9/11?

09:21.584 --> 09:22.551
Alleged.

09:22.684 --> 09:25.984
And no, I'm defending
habeas corpus...

09:26.117 --> 09:28.951
which Bush and Rumsfeld are
dismantling gleefully as we speak.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.951
Nancy, we'd all love a pop
at this administration,

09:32.083 --> 09:33.150
but there's more
to consider.

09:33.284 --> 09:35.317
People wanna
see these guys burn.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.284
Including plenty
of prospective clients.

09:37.417 --> 09:41.117
Well, the US government is holding
upwards of 700 prisoners in Guantánamo.

09:41.250 --> 09:44.450
And we don't know who they are.
We don't know what they're charged with.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.083
Since when did we start locking people
up without a trial in this country?

09:48.217 --> 09:50.651
I don't want you spinning
your wheels on this.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.417
David...

09:53.551 --> 09:57.217
we agreed that we could pick
our own pro bono fights.

09:57.350 --> 09:58.684
No interference.

09:59.817 --> 10:01.551
I like the look of this fight.

10:02.584 --> 10:05.083
I'm only coming
to you as a courtesy.

10:07.851 --> 10:09.083
Okay.

10:10.617 --> 10:11.984
What do you need?

10:12.117 --> 10:17.150
Uh, just me for now,
and a translator with security clearance.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.117
The prisoner speaks Arabic,
French, and German.

10:20.784 --> 10:22.050
Sounds expensive.

10:24.384 --> 10:26.350
Hey, Teri, you speak French,
right?

10:27.350 --> 10:29.817
Yeah.
But I'm on the Goranson case.

10:29.951 --> 10:31.384
Airlines.

10:31.517 --> 10:33.617
- Yeah, it's got no legs.
- That's a bit harsh.

10:33.751 --> 10:36.350
I looked at it.
You got the wrong plaintiff.

10:36.484 --> 10:38.784
No jury's
gonna get past that.

10:40.150 --> 10:41.183
Yeah.

10:41.317 --> 10:42.551
Teri?

10:45.217 --> 10:46.817
Yes, sure.

10:46.951 --> 10:48.617
I mean...

10:48.751 --> 10:51.484
who doesn't want
a free trip to Cuba, right?

10:53.350 --> 10:55.317
We got a little break now.
What time is it?

10:55.450 --> 10:57.951
Yeah, we got about 20 minutes.
You wanna grab a coffee?

10:58.083 --> 11:00.050
- I could take one intravenously.
- Sure.

11:00.183 --> 11:01.417
Hey, Stu!

11:02.484 --> 11:05.651
Oh! I'll catch up
with y'all in a few.

11:05.784 --> 11:09.350
Sir, I didn't see your name on
the schedule. You giving a talk?

11:09.484 --> 11:12.751
No, just passing through.
Hey, you know Whit Cobb over at OGC?

11:12.884 --> 11:14.751
Sure. What gives?

11:14.884 --> 11:17.384
Well, we're putting something together.
Your name came up. You got a minute?

11:17.517 --> 11:19.083
Yeah.

11:22.817 --> 11:24.050
Here we are.

11:26.183 --> 11:27.884
Hey, look who I found.

11:28.018 --> 11:30.217
Hey, Whit.
How's it been?

11:30.350 --> 11:32.617
Stuart. Great to see you again
after all these years.

11:32.751 --> 11:33.751
And you.

11:33.884 --> 11:35.751
This is Bob.
He's, um, OGA.

11:36.884 --> 11:37.918
Stu and I worked together...

11:38.050 --> 11:39.417
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

11:39.551 --> 11:41.717
Stu and I worked together
on that drug case back in...

11:41.851 --> 11:43.384
- When was it?
- Uh, '96, '97.

11:43.517 --> 11:46.150
He rolled 'em up
one after another.

11:46.284 --> 11:48.050
Lehnert called him
his "dog on a chain."

11:48.183 --> 11:52.551
General Lehnert could get us to low
crawl through hell in a gasoline suit.

11:54.918 --> 11:58.751
You been paying much attention
to what's going on down at Gitmo?

11:59.717 --> 12:01.417
A little, yeah.

12:01.551 --> 12:06.183
I have orders to stand up a 9/11 war court
for enemy combatants held in Guantánamo

12:06.317 --> 12:08.918
under jurisdiction
of the president.

12:09.050 --> 12:11.717
You're familiar
with Ex Parte Quirin?

12:12.684 --> 12:15.584
The World War II case
with eight Nazi saboteurs

12:15.717 --> 12:18.551
that were caught sneaking
into the US by U-boat?

12:18.684 --> 12:21.617
Eight Nazis, eight convictions
in less than a month.

12:21.751 --> 12:23.117
You forgot the punch line.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.684
Six of them
were given the electric chair.

12:25.817 --> 12:29.083
Rough justice. That's what
this administration wants.

12:29.217 --> 12:30.984
We've taken a lot of prisoners
in Afghanistan,

12:31.117 --> 12:34.551
working our way through to Bin Laden
and the guys who planned this shit.

12:34.684 --> 12:36.751
There's a backlog
needs clearing.

12:36.884 --> 12:41.851
Bill tells me a good friend of yours
was on one of the planes, 9/11.

12:41.984 --> 12:43.884
Bruce Taylor.

12:44.018 --> 12:47.217
He was first officer on Flight 175,
the plane that hit the South Tower.

12:48.250 --> 12:52.083
We flew KC-130s
at Cherry Point together.

12:52.217 --> 12:58.183
Cathy and my wife, Kim, they worked
at the same hospital together, so...

13:06.484 --> 13:09.284
Mohamedou Ould Slahi.
The Mauritanian.

13:10.183 --> 13:12.217
Fought with Al-Qaeda
in Afghanistan in the '90s.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.884
Key recruiter for 9/11
in Germany.

13:15.018 --> 13:17.717
He recruited Marwan al-Shehhi,

13:17.851 --> 13:21.751
the son of a bitch who flew your
friend's plane into the South Tower.

13:24.250 --> 13:29.183
The administration regards
this as the first death penalty case.

13:31.050 --> 13:33.551
We want you
to lead the prosecution.

13:36.117 --> 13:37.551
When do we start?

13:43.617 --> 13:46.050
<i>Our flight time is
three and a half hours to Cuba.</i>

13:46.183 --> 13:51.117
<i>We offer no beverages, no snacks and
no facilities aboard this aircraft.</i>

13:51.250 --> 13:52.517
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:10.484 --> 14:13.350
Welcome to
US Naval Base Guantánamo.

14:13.484 --> 14:17.150
This base exists outside of
US legal jurisdiction.

14:17.284 --> 14:21.918
If you stray outside the designated areas,
you will be removed from the island.

14:22.050 --> 14:23.717
Apart from your client,

14:23.851 --> 14:26.584
you're not to speak to or
communicate with the detainees.

14:26.717 --> 14:29.784
You're not to discuss classified
information with your client,

14:29.918 --> 14:32.050
even if it pertains
to his case.

14:32.951 --> 14:35.617
Illegal disclosures
may result in your arrest

14:35.751 --> 14:38.651
and immediate removal
from the island.

14:38.784 --> 14:42.551
If you wish to grab your
client some grub, do so now.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.584
Do we know what he likes?

14:46.284 --> 14:48.517
Get the Filet-O-Fish.
It's halal.

15:14.817 --> 15:15.751
Honor bound.

15:15.884 --> 15:17.217
Defending freedom.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.117
Open up!

15:23.651 --> 15:24.684
Sir.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.150
Step up to the
line, IDs out.

15:30.117 --> 15:31.717
Leave your bag here.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.551
Glasses off.

15:41.717 --> 15:45.217
Take a notepad and one
writing implement in with you.

15:45.350 --> 15:47.951
It's recommended you wear a
hijab when visiting your client.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.884
We've had incidents of inmates
spitting at female lawyers.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.984
- Head count on civilians departing.
- <i>From Camp Echo.</i>

15:54.117 --> 15:55.751
Step up to the line,
IDs out.

16:32.117 --> 16:34.617
Any notes you take
here are deemed classified.

16:34.751 --> 16:36.617
We'll collect them
after your meeting.

16:36.751 --> 16:39.751
You can retrieve them
in a secure facility stateside.

16:50.651 --> 16:53.250
For your own safety,
we will be monitoring the meeting.

16:53.384 --> 16:55.551
You listening to us?
You're recording?

16:55.684 --> 16:57.183
No, video only.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.884
In the event the detainee lunges for
you, push back away from the table.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.717
We'll get in there
as quick as we can.

17:26.517 --> 17:28.450
<i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

17:29.417 --> 17:30.817
<i>Wa-alaikum salaam.</i>

17:44.484 --> 17:45.751
<i>Bonjour. Enchantée.</i>

17:45.884 --> 17:48.417
<i>Je suis Maître Theresa Duncan
et je voudrais...</i>

17:48.551 --> 17:50.018
My lawyers.

17:50.150 --> 17:52.517
You speak English?
How did you learn?

17:52.651 --> 17:55.918
Same as you,
one word at a time.

17:56.050 --> 17:57.317
Sit.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.551
I'm Nancy Hollander.
This is my associate, Teri Duncan,

18:07.684 --> 18:10.751
and we're from the firm
of Freedman, Boyd and Hollander

18:10.884 --> 18:12.350
based in New Mexico.

18:12.484 --> 18:14.484
And we wish to represent you.

18:16.183 --> 18:17.651
We brought you
some food.

18:17.784 --> 18:20.150
Hope it's okay.
It's all they have on base.

18:29.651 --> 18:33.484
Mr. Slahi, I understand that it
might be hard for you to believe,

18:33.617 --> 18:35.851
but we are not here
as interrogators.

18:35.984 --> 18:39.150
We are not working for the
US government in any way.

18:43.651 --> 18:49.284
Well, I'd like to explain
your legal situation.

18:49.417 --> 18:52.918
In June, the Supreme Court,
the highest court in the land,

18:53.050 --> 18:54.551
ruled that prisoners
in Guantánamo

18:54.684 --> 18:57.918
are entitled to file
for habeas corpus petitions.

18:58.050 --> 18:59.717
This means that the government

18:59.851 --> 19:03.584
must produce any evidence
that they have against you,

19:03.717 --> 19:08.284
and then the court decides if that
evidence is enough to justify holding you.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.617
And if it isn't,
you'll be released.

19:10.751 --> 19:13.417
Well, if you agree
to let us represent you,

19:13.551 --> 19:15.851
we will file a writ of habeas
on your behalf.

19:15.984 --> 19:17.417
This is the contract.

19:19.384 --> 19:20.984
How can you defend me

19:21.117 --> 19:22.751
if you don't even know
what I'm charged with?

19:22.884 --> 19:25.384
- Have you been charged?
- No! No, no.

19:26.350 --> 19:29.050
Three years,
they charged me with nothing.

19:29.183 --> 19:31.183
They kidnapped me
from my home

19:31.317 --> 19:34.317
and put me in a jail in
Jordan for five months,

19:34.450 --> 19:36.484
then in a military base
in Afghanistan,

19:36.617 --> 19:39.150
which was like living in a
toilet, by the way,

19:39.284 --> 19:43.317
and brought me here with a bag on
my head and chains around my body.

19:43.450 --> 19:46.183
What do they accuse you of
during your interrogations?

19:46.317 --> 19:50.918
I'm interrogated 18 hours,
every day, 3 years.

19:51.050 --> 19:55.350
That's like... go ask Charlie
Sheen to name all his girlfriends.

19:56.884 --> 19:58.284
So you get
the news here.

19:59.250 --> 20:02.684
Now that I... cooperate...

20:05.018 --> 20:07.517
they let me have a TV.

20:07.651 --> 20:12.284
We don't get news,
but we have this show, <i>E Exclamation.</i>

20:13.951 --> 20:18.083
It's just <i>E!</i>
I think the exclamation is silent.

20:21.584 --> 20:23.918
Have they shown you any evidence
they have against you?

20:24.050 --> 20:27.250
No. Yes... No.

20:27.384 --> 20:34.317
Well, one time they showed I had taken
a call from Bin Laden's satellite phone.

20:37.450 --> 20:39.884
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

20:40.018 --> 20:41.417
That was my cousin.

20:41.551 --> 20:43.651
He calls me,
I don't know what phone he is using.

20:44.617 --> 20:46.183
I took a call.

20:47.684 --> 20:48.817
Just the once?

20:48.951 --> 20:51.183
He just called you once
from Bin Laden's phone?

20:54.918 --> 20:58.617
They're watching everything I
say, everything I do.

21:00.450 --> 21:01.951
They only have video.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.317
Oh, yeah?

21:06.350 --> 21:08.984
We can't talk about these
things, not here.

21:09.117 --> 21:11.117
Will you write it down?

21:11.250 --> 21:13.551
Your story, how you came here,
what happened to you,

21:13.684 --> 21:15.484
will you write that down
for us?

21:15.617 --> 21:17.751
So my interrogators
can read it?

21:19.083 --> 21:23.317
I tried that once already.
It didn't end well.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.350
Well, we need your testimony.

21:26.217 --> 21:28.951
I've been writing all my life,
and I like that.

21:29.083 --> 21:32.417
But writing here is way
much dangerous than talking.

21:32.551 --> 21:34.450
If you choose
to let us represent you,

21:34.584 --> 21:36.584
then we will have
attorney-client privilege.

21:36.717 --> 21:40.150
And that means that anything that you
say, anything that you write down,

21:40.284 --> 21:42.951
will be protected
from the prosecution by law.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.984
They can't use it
against you.

21:45.117 --> 21:49.284
You don't wanna do that, then don't sign.
You can stay here trouble-free.

21:51.450 --> 21:53.050
One minute.

22:03.117 --> 22:04.717
Okay.

22:11.150 --> 22:12.951
You do one thing for me.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.350
Call this number.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.617
Ask to speak
to my mother.

22:19.751 --> 22:21.117
Tell her...

22:22.217 --> 22:25.384
I don't know,
something nice.

22:27.851 --> 22:29.083
That's it.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.450
All right.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.584
Thank you.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.350
See you later, alligators.

22:42.083 --> 22:43.551
Now you have to say...

22:45.350 --> 22:46.817
"After a while, crocodile."

22:47.851 --> 22:49.551
Not for a while,
crocodile.

22:49.684 --> 22:51.284
Good enough.

22:51.417 --> 22:52.851
Gather your notes together.

22:52.984 --> 22:55.150
You'll get them back at
the secure facility stateside.

23:00.617 --> 23:01.651
In here.

23:02.417 --> 23:04.018
Who decided
to put him in shackles?

23:04.150 --> 23:06.517
Protocol.
It's for your protection, ma'am.

23:08.150 --> 23:09.984
I wanna know whose name
I should cite

23:10.117 --> 23:13.384
when I contact the National
Security desk at <i>The New York Times.</i>

23:13.517 --> 23:17.384
You tell your CO I don't wanna see
my client in shackles ever again.

23:28.584 --> 23:30.217
Are you praying?

23:30.350 --> 23:32.851
No, memorizing
his mother's number.

23:32.984 --> 23:34.751
We're not gonna
call that number.

23:34.884 --> 23:36.417
No, we gotta
clear it first.

23:36.551 --> 23:37.984
We don't know who's on the
other end of that line.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.150
You don't think
it's his mother?

23:40.284 --> 23:42.018
I don't know.

23:42.150 --> 23:45.117
But no one just gets a phone
call from Bin Laden's sat phone.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.551
This is our guy.

23:52.384 --> 23:56.018
He got a scholarship to study electrical
engineering in Germany in 1988.

23:56.150 --> 24:00.250
Two years later, he traveled to
Afghanistan and joined Al-Qaeda.

24:01.951 --> 24:05.817
These are just two of the bad
guys we know he associated with.

24:05.951 --> 24:07.751
Mahfouz Ould al-Walid,

24:07.884 --> 24:12.284
otherwise known as Abu Hafs,
Slahi's cousin and brother-in-law.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.918
They were close growing up.

24:15.050 --> 24:19.884
In the mid-'90s, Abu Hafs was designated
personal poet and spiritual adviser

24:20.018 --> 24:21.517
to Bin Laden himself.

24:22.117 --> 24:23.651
Between '97 and '99,

24:23.784 --> 24:26.450
German intelligence tracked
money transfers and phone calls

24:26.584 --> 24:29.250
between Slahi
and his cousin in Afghanistan.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.384
We can show that Slahi
was financing terror.

24:33.517 --> 24:37.284
Ramzi bin al-Shibh,
the so-called 20th hijacker.

24:41.918 --> 24:46.250
In '99, Slahi recruited bin al-Shibh
and other members of the Hamburg cell,

24:46.384 --> 24:48.250
including Marwan al-Shehhi,

24:48.384 --> 24:51.083
pilot of the plane
that hit the South Tower,

24:51.217 --> 24:54.350
and Ziad Jarrah,
who was on United 93.

24:56.784 --> 24:58.484
That's just two.

24:58.617 --> 25:01.117
There's about ten other scary
names he crossed paths with.

25:02.217 --> 25:05.217
This dude
is the Al-Qaeda Forrest Gump.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.484
Everywhere you look,
he's there.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.817
It's all there
in the top sheet.

25:10.951 --> 25:13.651
Now we gotta check through the
intel reports and corroborate.

25:14.284 --> 25:16.517
Be exacting, thorough.

25:16.651 --> 25:19.484
We are seeking
the death penalty,

25:19.617 --> 25:22.450
but if we miss something,
this guy goes home.

25:22.584 --> 25:23.651
All right?

25:24.684 --> 25:25.684
Let's get to it.

25:26.717 --> 25:28.350
<i>Please apologize to her.</i>

25:28.484 --> 25:30.417
<i>It's just taken a while
to get the clearance.</i>

25:33.050 --> 25:36.684
<i>Madam Slahi would like to know,
have you really seen her son?</i>

25:37.684 --> 25:42.384
Yes, we've seen him,
in Guantánamo prison, Cuba.

26:00.751 --> 26:03.350
Wrap it up.
I'll see you afterwards.

26:05.617 --> 26:07.183
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

26:07.317 --> 26:08.884
Yes, hi. Sorry.

26:09.018 --> 26:12.617
<i>How does he look?
Is he well? Is he eating?</i>

26:13.717 --> 26:15.018
He looks well.

26:15.150 --> 26:19.551
He wanted us to tell you that
he misses you very, very much.

26:29.317 --> 26:30.817
We need to go to Virginia.

26:30.951 --> 26:33.384
I just got a notification
from the Privilege team.

26:33.517 --> 26:35.050
Mohamedou's written to us.

26:35.183 --> 26:36.183
Okay.

26:36.317 --> 26:38.817
I typed up
the rest of that call.

26:41.751 --> 26:44.484
Do you know why Mohamedou
wanted us to call her?

26:45.517 --> 26:46.918
Because she's his mother?

26:47.050 --> 26:49.984
Because every mother believes
that her son is innocent.

26:50.117 --> 26:52.083
He wanted us to hear that.

26:52.217 --> 26:55.817
That doesn't matter because it's
not the case we're building.

26:55.951 --> 27:00.083
We need to prove that the US government
lacks evidence sufficient to detain him.

27:00.217 --> 27:01.684
Anything else is a distraction.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.450
Files are in.
We need to get to Virginia.

27:12.018 --> 27:15.117
Any material you read here
is between you and your client.

27:15.250 --> 27:18.484
But anything you wanna cite in
court or remove from the facility

27:18.617 --> 27:21.884
has to be cleared by me or another
member of the Privilege team.

27:22.018 --> 27:24.450
- You have to read it?
- Yeah, every word.

27:24.584 --> 27:26.717
So try and only bring me
the juicy stuff.

27:26.851 --> 27:29.617
But don't worry,
we are walled off from the prosecution.

27:29.751 --> 27:32.117
If we share anything with them,
I'm doing prison time.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.551
Trust me,
I ain't cut out for that.

27:34.684 --> 27:36.317
Once we've
reviewed the material,

27:36.450 --> 27:38.417
we designate it either
classified or protected.

27:38.551 --> 27:41.050
Protected means you don't have
to come in here to view it.

27:41.183 --> 27:42.684
We will fax it to your office

27:42.817 --> 27:45.684
where it can only be accessed
by those with proper clearance.

27:45.817 --> 27:47.851
Anything from here
ends up in my Sunday papers...

27:47.984 --> 27:50.984
Well, you guys are the lawyers.
You know how that goes.

27:51.117 --> 27:53.050
Don't lose your keys.

27:53.183 --> 27:56.150
It is a pain in the butt to find a
locksmith with the proper clearance.

27:58.284 --> 28:00.384
That's a joke.
We got spares.

28:01.851 --> 28:03.450
Don't forget your codes,

28:03.584 --> 28:05.517
and my office is down there
when you're done.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.150
Wait, we didn't
get your name.

28:07.284 --> 28:08.717
- Kent.
- Kent what?

28:08.851 --> 28:12.584
Kent tell you any more than that.

28:23.117 --> 28:25.450
Okay. All right.

28:28.651 --> 28:30.250
Seals look good.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.617
All right,
take half.

28:49.751 --> 28:53.584
Where are the case files? Nancy?

28:54.350 --> 28:56.484
The government
withheld the case files?

28:56.617 --> 28:59.684
Yeah. They're not gonna give us
anything until they absolutely have to.

28:59.817 --> 29:02.851
I already put in for a
Freedom of Information request,

29:02.984 --> 29:07.317
but until that gets in,
just focus on our client's testimony.

29:26.250 --> 29:27.751
Heads down, no moving!

29:28.784 --> 29:30.517
Do you fucking have ears?

29:33.050 --> 29:35.751
Get the fuck down!

29:35.884 --> 29:37.450
Don't even fucking breathe!

29:39.484 --> 29:41.050
- Don't look at me!
- You fucking stay!

29:41.183 --> 29:43.317
On your knees!

30:56.684 --> 30:58.284
Seven-sixty, turn around.

30:58.417 --> 31:00.584
Seven-sixty, that's you.

31:00.717 --> 31:03.684
I said turn around!

31:08.684 --> 31:11.150
Hand on head.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.517
Reservation!

32:25.050 --> 32:26.284
Seven-sixty!

32:33.217 --> 32:35.284
Seven-sixty,
give me your hands.

32:35.417 --> 32:36.717
Give me your hands!

32:38.817 --> 32:40.183
Hands now!

32:44.317 --> 32:47.717
All right, turn around.
Turn! Turn around!

33:24.584 --> 33:26.250
<i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

33:26.884 --> 33:28.250
<i>Wa-alaikum salaam.</i>

33:28.384 --> 33:29.984
We're here
to have a conversation.

33:32.183 --> 33:35.651
We wanna understand your whole story.

33:36.617 --> 33:39.450
No one's gonna hurt you.

33:40.317 --> 33:42.684
That shit is not allowed.

33:45.884 --> 33:47.317
Do you have any questions?

33:53.284 --> 33:55.817
Why Cuba? You guys hate Cuba.

33:58.183 --> 33:59.784
Who says we're in Cuba?

34:02.951 --> 34:05.751
I saw it at the airport.

34:05.884 --> 34:07.751
Why,
is it a secret we're in Cuba?

34:07.884 --> 34:09.817
Well, not anymore.

34:11.284 --> 34:14.284
The idea is to,
you know, disorient you.

34:14.417 --> 34:16.516
We have a base here.

34:16.650 --> 34:20.951
It's secure. It's warm.
Plus, I get to surf when I'm off duty.

34:24.384 --> 34:27.018
It works for everybody.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.684
Exactly.

34:43.684 --> 34:46.784
It's 300 degrees in here.
I don't know how you guys wanna drink tea.

34:53.449 --> 34:54.851
So, are you married?

34:58.018 --> 35:00.717
Divorced. Are you?

35:00.851 --> 35:02.584
Yeah, divorced too.

35:02.717 --> 35:05.250
Trust me, brother,
I know how that goes.

35:07.050 --> 35:08.450
Let's talk about your family.

35:08.584 --> 35:12.350
Your dad's job. Any travel?

35:15.117 --> 35:17.217
Constantly,
he traveled for work.

35:17.350 --> 35:18.851
He was a camel herder.

35:18.984 --> 35:20.217
He died...

35:21.584 --> 35:22.617
when I was nine.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.684
All his life
he refused to get in a car.

35:27.817 --> 35:33.117
He felt like it would ruin
his natural ability to navigate.

35:33.684 --> 35:35.050
Wait, wait, wait.

35:35.183 --> 35:36.651
He never rode in a car?

35:36.784 --> 35:39.350
Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yeah, I'm calling bullshit.

35:43.117 --> 35:45.183
You're right. I'm lying.

35:46.617 --> 35:51.317
He got in a car once
to look for a lost calf.

35:52.617 --> 35:55.684
After two seconds,
he freaked out and got out.

35:55.817 --> 35:57.083
Full on.

35:59.150 --> 36:03.751
My father's one and only two-seconds ride.
You pried it out of me.

36:07.350 --> 36:10.250
Can we fast-forward a bit?

36:11.584 --> 36:14.651
- Afghanistan.
- Afghanistan.

36:14.784 --> 36:17.183
How'd you come
to train with Al-Qaeda?

36:59.984 --> 37:00.951
Cathy.

37:01.083 --> 37:02.317
Hey!

37:02.450 --> 37:03.484
Hey.

37:04.617 --> 37:06.050
How are you?

37:06.183 --> 37:07.417
Good.

37:08.217 --> 37:10.584
Everything all right?
Kim and the boys?

37:15.117 --> 37:17.117
I just didn't want anyone else
to tell you,

37:17.250 --> 37:19.517
but I'm prosecuting
a Gitmo case.

37:21.350 --> 37:23.484
One of the recruiters
from 9/11.

37:27.117 --> 37:29.517
He put those men
on my husband's plane?

37:31.417 --> 37:35.018
Sorry.
I didn't mean to ambush you.

37:35.150 --> 37:37.551
I just didn't want
somebody else telling you.

37:38.617 --> 37:41.484
Cathy,
I'm gonna make him pay.

37:42.884 --> 37:44.150
Thank you.

37:45.684 --> 37:48.150
You know, Bruce never liked
coming to church much.

37:48.284 --> 37:50.884
He always said he felt
closer to God in the cockpit.

37:51.018 --> 37:57.217
Well, if God was on Flight 175,
he is sure as shit with you right now.

38:00.150 --> 38:02.384
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

38:45.884 --> 38:47.350
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

38:53.117 --> 38:54.584
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

39:00.584 --> 39:05.083
Turn around.
Give me your hands. Move.

39:07.984 --> 39:09.651
Two-four-two, Camp Echo.

39:09.784 --> 39:11.984
Copy that.

41:00.417 --> 41:03.951
"Yes, I am gonna win this.
And I don't take no for an answer."

41:04.083 --> 41:05.551
- And you shouldn't!
- And I won!

41:05.684 --> 41:07.851
- I won. You should've seen his face.
- Oh, my gosh.

41:07.984 --> 41:10.551
I know what you mean.
You're always winning.

41:10.684 --> 41:12.117
That's hilarious.

41:14.018 --> 41:15.751
We like it
that way, don't we?

41:17.350 --> 41:19.250
Sorry. So, yeah...

41:20.517 --> 41:22.083
Now I know
you're ignoring me.

41:22.217 --> 41:24.884
Nancy.

41:25.018 --> 41:26.651
Do you know
Jeff and Valerie?

41:26.784 --> 41:29.350
- Hi.
- General counsel for Spirit Dynamics.

41:29.484 --> 41:32.317
Oh, yes.
Airplanes and missiles.

41:33.450 --> 41:35.350
We need to talk about
that Guantánamo case of ours.

41:35.484 --> 41:36.584
Shall I just pull up a seat?

41:36.717 --> 41:38.817
If you'll excuse us
for a minute.

41:38.951 --> 41:40.350
Please. No. Come on.

41:40.484 --> 41:42.183
All right,
I need a favor.

41:42.317 --> 41:46.150
Most people, they say, "Please,
may I?" None of this kamikaze bullshit.

41:46.284 --> 41:47.851
But you owe me,
all right?

41:47.984 --> 41:49.317
I took over
the Slahi case.

41:49.450 --> 41:51.183
I got his family
off your back,

41:51.317 --> 41:53.384
which, let's be honest,
that's all you were hoping for.

41:53.517 --> 41:55.617
What do you need?

41:55.751 --> 41:57.884
I need to corroborate
Slahi's testimony.

41:58.018 --> 42:00.484
All right? There was a French national
that was detained alongside of him.

42:00.617 --> 42:02.450
Guantánamo's
pretending he doesn't exist.

42:02.584 --> 42:06.784
I don't know his name,
but I have his prison ID, which is 241.

42:07.517 --> 42:09.284
What can I do
with only a number?

42:09.417 --> 42:10.651
He's from Marseille.

42:10.784 --> 42:14.751
Go call DGSE,
see if they can track him down.

42:15.551 --> 42:18.117
Hey, it's one phone call,
buddy.

42:19.684 --> 42:22.651
Did you see Slahi
found himself a lawyer?

42:22.784 --> 42:23.784
Who?

42:23.918 --> 42:25.717
Nancy Hollander.

42:25.851 --> 42:29.617
Some humanitarian crusader
down in Albuquerque.

42:29.751 --> 42:32.817
She's been fighting the
government since Vietnam.

42:33.784 --> 42:36.450
- That's a losing battle.
- Hmm.

42:43.217 --> 42:45.083
- Sir?
- Mm-hmm.

42:45.217 --> 42:46.751
I'm kinda confused.

42:48.384 --> 42:51.217
See, there's so many
contradictions in these reports.

42:51.350 --> 42:53.384
Yeah, well, that's how it is
with raw intel.

42:53.517 --> 42:56.284
You gotta order them by date,
put all the pieces together.

42:56.417 --> 42:58.250
See, that's just it.

42:58.384 --> 43:01.450
JTF interrogators,
they left all the dates off.

43:04.851 --> 43:06.250
I could put a call in.

43:06.384 --> 43:07.551
Good luck with that.

43:07.684 --> 43:09.083
CIA won't help.

43:09.217 --> 43:11.551
They're still treating
Slahi's intel as active.

43:11.684 --> 43:13.083
Neil Buckland?

43:13.217 --> 43:14.384
Who's that?

43:14.517 --> 43:16.517
A classmate of mine
at Quantico.

43:17.250 --> 43:19.117
It's his name
on the report.

43:21.951 --> 43:22.918
- Say, Neil.
- Yeah.

43:23.050 --> 43:24.651
How's the rental market here?

43:24.784 --> 43:28.918
I'm thinking of moving Kim,
the boys, here for the summer

43:29.050 --> 43:30.651
if this case
keeps dragging out.

43:30.784 --> 43:33.551
Case? You talking about your Gitmo thing?
How's that going?

43:34.617 --> 43:37.083
Tell you the truth,
I'm lost in the sauce a bit.

43:37.217 --> 43:42.250
I mean, whole thing'd move a lot
faster if I could get an understanding

43:42.384 --> 43:44.284
of how some of these IRs
came together.

43:44.417 --> 43:45.950
No way, Jose.

43:46.083 --> 43:48.317
Seventh floor's got all that
Gitmo intel locked up tight.

43:48.450 --> 43:51.317
Well, your name's all over
some of my case files.

43:52.150 --> 43:54.584
You working down there
when Slahi came in?

43:54.717 --> 43:56.484
Slahi? That's your guy?

43:56.617 --> 43:58.951
Oh, my God,
you must be feeling it.

43:59.083 --> 44:01.684
I hear POTUS
tracks him in his daily.

44:01.817 --> 44:04.817
You know anything about him
recruiting bin al-Shibh?

44:05.751 --> 44:08.918
I don't know.
Gitmo was churning out MFRs.

44:09.050 --> 44:11.651
The whole desk pitched in on
it, put the reports together.

44:11.784 --> 44:13.117
MFRs? What's that?

44:13.250 --> 44:15.384
Memorandum for the Record.

44:15.517 --> 44:17.450
You're working
off of summaries.

44:17.584 --> 44:19.951
MFRs are the originals
and carry all the details.

44:20.083 --> 44:24.317
You know, who was there,
techniques used, detainee transcripts.

44:24.450 --> 44:26.384
Can you get me access
to those?

44:26.517 --> 44:29.551
Sure, if I don't mind
violating the Espionage Act.

44:29.684 --> 44:32.551
I mean, come on. What do you need 'em for?
You know what they did.

44:33.317 --> 44:35.651
The whole world
saw it go down on TV.

45:39.217 --> 45:41.350
- Hey, just in.
- Thank you.

45:48.884 --> 45:51.284
<i>Tell me about
your relationship with Osama.</i>

45:56.384 --> 45:58.751
You realize I've never met Bin
Laden, don't you?

45:58.884 --> 46:01.984
But your cousin called you
from Bin Laden's satellite phone.

46:04.183 --> 46:05.851
And just after that phone call,

46:05.984 --> 46:09.083
your cousin wired you 5,000 dollars
from an Al-Qaeda training camp.

46:17.350 --> 46:19.617
My cousin's
father in Mauritania was sick.

46:20.484 --> 46:23.551
And he needed the money
for the hospital.

46:23.684 --> 46:26.918
So his son sent me the money,
and I paid the hospital.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.317
You got proof?

46:33.150 --> 46:35.751
No proof.
You brought me here naked.

46:42.517 --> 46:44.684
I don't know this man.

46:44.817 --> 46:46.083
Well, he knows you.

46:46.217 --> 46:47.684
We captured him
in Pakistan.

46:47.817 --> 46:49.450
I interrogated him myself.

46:49.584 --> 46:52.517
He was very, very cooperative.

47:05.717 --> 47:07.651
Yeah.

47:13.918 --> 47:15.851
Yeah, I think we met one time.

47:15.984 --> 47:17.551
Nah, well,
wrong again, bro.

47:17.684 --> 47:21.350
Ramzi bin al-Shibh says
he knows you very well.

47:23.050 --> 47:24.651
His name is Ramzi?

47:24.784 --> 47:26.183
Come on, man.

47:26.317 --> 47:29.484
He was one of the key actors
in 9/11, the 20th hijacker.

47:29.617 --> 47:31.717
He says he stayed with you
in Germany,

47:31.851 --> 47:36.784
that you recruited him and
Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah.

47:42.717 --> 47:44.717
He's lying.

47:44.851 --> 47:49.851
Listen, we've got sworn testimonies saying
that you are the head recruiter for 9/11.

47:49.984 --> 47:52.350
Now, if you can't sell me
on your version of events,

47:52.484 --> 47:54.551
I'm gonna have to go
with bin al-Shibh's.

48:01.584 --> 48:03.384
He stayed
with me only one night.

48:05.918 --> 48:09.284
He was a friend of a friend
of a friend from the mosque.

48:10.183 --> 48:13.050
My house was like that.
Anyone could come stay.

48:15.817 --> 48:17.417
- That's it.
- That's it?

48:17.551 --> 48:19.217
That's it.

48:19.350 --> 48:21.817
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Mohamedou.

49:02.684 --> 49:05.484
Turn around.
Give me your hands.

51:05.250 --> 51:07.250
That's a lot of case files.

51:07.384 --> 51:10.350
Well, the government's had
a four-year head start on us.

51:11.083 --> 51:12.317
All right.

51:30.217 --> 51:31.717
What the fuck?

51:56.651 --> 51:57.684
Hey.

51:59.018 --> 52:01.217
You guys
didn't come see me today.

52:01.350 --> 52:02.817
What's the latest
from your pen pal?

52:02.951 --> 52:05.617
What, did the printer at the
Pentagon have a hissy fit?

52:05.751 --> 52:07.984
What the fuck is this, Kent?
It's all redacted.

52:08.117 --> 52:09.918
Hey, I'm responsible
for what goes out.

52:10.050 --> 52:13.050
You got a problem with what comes in,
you take it up with the government.

52:13.183 --> 52:14.484
Goddamn it.

52:38.217 --> 52:40.217
- Stu.
- Sir.

52:40.350 --> 52:42.417
I'm gonna grab some lunch
with Whit Cobb tomorrow.

52:42.551 --> 52:44.684
He's gonna ask us
to set a trial date.

52:44.817 --> 52:48.417
We're not there yet, sir.
We're still trying to corroborate.

52:48.551 --> 52:50.551
You've got boxes
of corroboration.

52:50.684 --> 52:53.083
The FBI didn't have
this much evidence on Gotti.

52:54.150 --> 52:57.217
Technically, this ain't evidence, sir.
It's just hearsay.

52:57.350 --> 53:00.018
Summaries. Slahi said this,
that and the other.

53:00.150 --> 53:03.284
But we have no idea when he
said it or who he said it to,

53:03.417 --> 53:05.250
the res gestae of it all.

53:05.384 --> 53:09.784
If we don't give the OGC a date,
pretty soon they're gonna give us one.

53:17.050 --> 53:19.551
Well, looks like we're
gonna have to find another way

53:19.684 --> 53:21.450
to cut the head
off this snake.

53:31.050 --> 53:32.884
<i>...by
Virginia Tech so far today...</i>

53:33.018 --> 53:35.384
No! What the hell are you doing,
running the ball on third and long?

53:35.517 --> 53:37.050
- Come on, man!
- You're kidding me!

53:37.183 --> 53:38.717
Neil, I think
something's burning.

53:38.851 --> 53:40.784
I can smell it all the
way from the office.

53:43.083 --> 53:45.183
- It's awful!
- Aw, man.

53:45.317 --> 53:47.684
Shit.

53:51.918 --> 53:52.984
Need a hand?

53:53.117 --> 53:54.684
Go, go.
You're missing the game.

53:55.417 --> 53:56.784
Come on, come on!

54:01.817 --> 54:03.784
Please tell me you didn't
drive all the way down here

54:03.918 --> 54:06.484
for anything other than
football and fellowship.

54:06.617 --> 54:09.384
The White House is breathing
down my neck to charge Slahi,

54:09.517 --> 54:12.284
and I'm still fumbling around
for a light switch.

54:13.551 --> 54:15.584
Well, okay.
How about I tell you what?

54:15.717 --> 54:18.484
I can swing you an agency
liaison for your task force.

54:18.617 --> 54:20.784
They won't have
the horsepower.

54:23.250 --> 54:25.551
What are you asking for?

54:25.684 --> 54:27.684
You've been on the inside
of these things.

54:27.817 --> 54:31.517
How do I get myself the MFRs,
the original notes?

54:31.651 --> 54:34.951
You don't, Stu.
Don't lean on me, man.

54:35.083 --> 54:38.150
Look, you know that the raw stuff's
only for the intel community,

54:38.284 --> 54:39.384
not evidence for trial.

54:39.517 --> 54:40.884
But that's where
this is heading.

54:41.018 --> 54:42.884
If I turn up
with 20,000 summaries,

54:43.018 --> 54:45.984
unless I have one put-it-in-the-bag
piece of evidence,

54:46.117 --> 54:47.050
Slahi's gonna walk.

54:47.183 --> 54:48.684
And I can't have that.

54:55.517 --> 54:57.617
- You know who General Mandel is?
- No.

54:57.751 --> 54:59.817
He oversees
the JTF interrogations.

54:59.951 --> 55:02.851
He's the only person who
can sign off on the MFRs.

55:02.984 --> 55:04.450
So, I gotta go down to Gitmo?

55:04.584 --> 55:08.417
Yeah. Well, the general's
not coming to you, sport.

55:31.317 --> 55:33.450
Are you serious?
How do you know this?

55:34.817 --> 55:38.651
"Lots of sugar. Six tablespoons."
Your mom was very specific.

55:41.384 --> 55:42.751
You guys speak with her?

55:47.083 --> 55:50.584
What did she say?
She is good?

55:50.717 --> 55:52.018
Yeah, she's good.

55:52.150 --> 55:54.918
She wanted me to tell you
that your brother, Yahdih...

55:55.050 --> 55:56.384
- Yahdih.
- Yahdih.

55:56.517 --> 55:58.117
He moved back home.

55:58.250 --> 56:01.217
And your niece has a daughter and
another little one on the way,

56:01.350 --> 56:03.751
and if it's a boy,
they're gonna name him after you.

56:05.551 --> 56:08.617
Two children already.

56:11.217 --> 56:13.317
Your letters
have been coming through.

56:14.784 --> 56:17.350
They were good?
You checked the seals?

56:17.484 --> 56:18.918
Nothing's
been tampered with.

56:19.050 --> 56:21.450
- You sure? 100%?
- Yes.

56:21.584 --> 56:25.183
And you need to keep writing,
'cause your letters are invaluable,

56:25.317 --> 56:27.083
especially now.

56:27.217 --> 56:30.150
The government won't show us the
evidence they have against you.

56:30.284 --> 56:32.150
Because they have none.

56:32.284 --> 56:34.083
You'll see, I'll keep writing.

56:37.784 --> 56:40.083
And, uh, they are...

56:40.918 --> 56:43.117
They are good? My letters?

56:43.250 --> 56:45.117
I mean,
you understand everything?

56:45.250 --> 56:46.384
No, they're great.

56:46.517 --> 56:48.018
You should've been
a writer.

56:50.018 --> 56:52.183
Next life, God willing.

56:52.317 --> 56:53.517
No, I mean it.

56:53.651 --> 56:55.517
Even the Privilege team
enjoys reading them.

56:56.517 --> 56:58.217
What? What?

56:58.350 --> 56:59.951
- What's "Privilege team"?
- It's okay.

57:00.083 --> 57:03.183
- They're separate from the prosecution.
- No, no, no, no, no.

57:03.317 --> 57:06.083
Who is reading?
You say to me attorney-client.

57:06.217 --> 57:08.083
I am client, you are attorney.

57:08.217 --> 57:10.117
What the fuck is Privilege team?

57:10.817 --> 57:12.751
It's an independent body.

57:12.884 --> 57:16.117
They evaluate your letters and determine
what needs to remain classified.

57:16.250 --> 57:19.551
But they're walled off from the
government and the prosecution.

57:20.617 --> 57:24.050
If my guards read the letters,
I am here.

57:24.183 --> 57:26.551
It's me they will fuck,
not you.

57:26.684 --> 57:29.250
We can't go forward
without the Privilege team.

57:29.384 --> 57:31.217
Now, that's
all there is to it.

57:33.350 --> 57:37.183
You gotta trust me, all right?
We haven't even gotten in the ring yet.

57:46.984 --> 57:48.450
- Okay.
- Good.

57:50.517 --> 57:52.450
Now I need you
to sue the government.

57:54.918 --> 57:56.918
- What?
- We have to file a motion to compel

57:57.050 --> 57:59.484
to get them to release the evidence
that they have against you.

57:59.617 --> 58:01.551
We can't fight
what we don't know.

58:04.150 --> 58:06.250
I mean what I say. Hmm?

58:08.183 --> 58:11.083
There's no evidence.
I trust you, you trust me.

58:11.217 --> 58:13.584
I am innocent.
I am innocent, okay?

58:13.717 --> 58:15.851
What do you need to see
to believe this?

58:15.984 --> 58:19.417
It doesn't matter what we believe.
What matters is what we can prove.

58:20.584 --> 58:23.517
You're like my interrogators,
just like them.

58:35.083 --> 58:36.784
We know
that you're innocent.

58:37.584 --> 58:38.717
We do.

58:38.851 --> 58:40.517
But we have to prove that,

58:40.651 --> 58:42.717
and we can't do that unless we
see the allegations against you.

58:42.851 --> 58:44.183
That's all
we're asking for.

58:50.817 --> 58:52.951
Who do you want to sue?

58:53.083 --> 58:54.684
You say, "Government."

58:54.817 --> 58:56.417
What does it mean?

58:58.083 --> 59:00.784
There'll be three names
on the lawsuit:

59:00.918 --> 59:06.384
The United States of America,
Donald Rumsfeld, and George W. Bush.

59:10.450 --> 59:13.584
Sure. Sure.

59:15.551 --> 59:16.584
Why not?

59:53.242 --> 59:57.342
You know, all he wanted was to hear
that we believed he was innocent.

59:57.475 --> 59:59.242
Why wouldn't you
just say it?

01:00:02.542 --> 01:00:04.676
Think I miscalculated
on the tea.

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:07.308
I'm not gonna last
three and a half hours.

01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:10.776
- You want anything?
- No.

01:00:15.342 --> 01:00:18.076
<i>...this afternoon,
which will make the case here</i>

01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:20.809
<i>that the Republicans are the
stronger party of the two</i>

01:00:20.942 --> 01:00:22.942
<i>when it comes to issues
of national security.</i>

01:00:23.076 --> 01:00:25.475
<i>Iraq, the number one issue
when it comes to voters,</i>

01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:28.043
<i>so President Bush, of course,
will be addressing this</i>

01:00:28.175 --> 01:00:32.475
<i>and essentially using it to make the
case that it was the right thing to do</i>

01:00:32.609 --> 01:00:33.809
<i>to remove Saddam Hussein.</i>

01:00:33.942 --> 01:00:35.342
Nancy Hollander?

01:00:37.043 --> 01:00:38.776
I'm Stuart Couch,

01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:41.909
lead counsel for the government
on your client's case.

01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:45.609
All right.

01:00:47.275 --> 01:00:49.342
I just got here.

01:00:49.475 --> 01:00:51.342
Seeing the camp
tomorrow.

01:00:52.509 --> 01:00:54.409
Can I get you
a drink?

01:00:56.876 --> 01:00:57.909
Okay.

01:01:00.275 --> 01:01:03.942
I wouldn't wanna post out here,
but the R&R doesn't look so bad.

01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:06.308
I know.

01:01:06.442 --> 01:01:08.742
One day, this'll all be
a tourist attraction.

01:01:10.175 --> 01:01:11.976
I'm not kidding.

01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:16.109
And the cruise ships from
the Keys will come and dock,

01:01:16.242 --> 01:01:21.043
and crowds will wander around
the cells with their daiquiris,

01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:23.609
trying to wrap their heads around
what the hell happened here.

01:01:23.742 --> 01:01:26.509
What do you think
is happening here?

01:01:27.009 --> 01:01:28.709
I don't know yet.

01:01:28.842 --> 01:01:31.542
But they built this place out of the
reach of the courts for a reason.

01:01:31.676 --> 01:01:34.776
The world's second largest
minefield to the north

01:01:34.909 --> 01:01:37.208
and shark-infested waters
to the south.

01:01:37.342 --> 01:01:39.442
There's two reasons.

01:01:39.575 --> 01:01:42.742
And what's the reason that
you're sitting on the case files?

01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:45.442
I'm not. We submitted
for discovery months ago.

01:01:45.575 --> 01:01:48.175
I received 20,000 pages
of redacted materials, so...

01:01:48.308 --> 01:01:51.043
- You should file a motion to compel.
- I'm going to.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:54.442
- I won't stand in your way.
- You won't stand in my way.

01:01:56.876 --> 01:01:58.542
You cranks all think

01:01:58.676 --> 01:02:01.175
that we're trying to set up some
kind of lawless garrison state.

01:02:01.308 --> 01:02:03.542
We're drinking beers
in a prison gift shop.

01:02:03.676 --> 01:02:05.509
What the hell else
would you call it?

01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:08.043
Military's founded
on law and order.

01:02:08.175 --> 01:02:09.575
They won't let you
out of boot camp

01:02:09.709 --> 01:02:12.609
unless you can square a
four-inch fold on a bedsheet.

01:02:12.742 --> 01:02:17.809
The law says you get open-file discovery,
and I want you to have discovery.

01:02:17.942 --> 01:02:19.542
That way when I beat ya,

01:02:19.676 --> 01:02:22.475
your client will have
nothing to hide behind.

01:02:23.409 --> 01:02:26.676
You sound very sure
of that outcome.

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:28.842
You haven't seen
what I've seen.

01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:36.242
Let me ask you, I understand
everyone has a right to a defense...

01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:40.942
but doesn't it bother you at all,
working for someone like this?

01:02:42.575 --> 01:02:45.442
I'm not just defending him,
I'm defending the rule of law.

01:02:46.409 --> 01:02:48.509
How very Ignatian of you.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:55.308
I didn't know they studied the
Jesuits in the Marine law school.

01:02:56.709 --> 01:03:00.076
We like to fully consider a
problem before we blow it up.

01:03:02.642 --> 01:03:06.809
My turn. Let me ask you:
what if you're wrong?

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:08.842
We're not.

01:03:08.976 --> 01:03:11.043
What if you are?

01:03:11.175 --> 01:03:13.143
You built this place,

01:03:13.275 --> 01:03:19.642
and you abandoned all of your principles,
all of your laws, and you're wrong?

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:36.342
We need to
change the conversation.

01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:38.475
What?

01:03:38.609 --> 01:03:40.876
Make this case about Mohamedou,
we're gonna lose.

01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:43.642
We need a new strategy.

01:03:51.076 --> 01:03:52.308
Sir.

01:03:54.575 --> 01:03:57.676
Colonel,
welcome to Camp India.

01:03:57.809 --> 01:04:01.542
Your man, Slahi,
was on this block for a while.

01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:17.043
What do they like to read?

01:04:17.175 --> 01:04:19.375
All types of stuff.

01:04:19.509 --> 01:04:21.409
If it's on there,
it's a detainee request.

01:04:21.542 --> 01:04:24.109
Bet they love
this religious fiction.

01:04:24.242 --> 01:04:26.609
They go nuts for that stuff, sir.
Look.

01:04:26.742 --> 01:04:29.742
We like to mess with them,
tear out the last chapter.

01:04:31.509 --> 01:04:34.575
Not me, sir,
some of the other guys.

01:04:34.709 --> 01:04:37.076
Got an empty bed on this block,
if you want to take a peek.

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:38.442
Sure.

01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:44.742
Whoo! Freezing.
What temp you keep it at?

01:04:45.475 --> 01:04:47.575
AC only go down
to about 52.

01:05:01.409 --> 01:05:03.208
There are two types of music
I can't abide.

01:05:03.342 --> 01:05:06.275
One is heavy metal,
and the other is country.

01:05:06.409 --> 01:05:08.742
In a pinch,
I'll suck it up for country.

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:12.409
Colonel coming through.

01:05:15.642 --> 01:05:17.542
General, I noticed
you keep the temp low,

01:05:17.676 --> 01:05:19.642
and there are restraints
in the walls and the floor.

01:05:19.776 --> 01:05:22.043
What is that,
sleep deprivation?

01:05:22.175 --> 01:05:24.375
It's one of the tools
in the box.

01:05:24.509 --> 01:05:27.976
Colonel Seidel told me
you were a naval aviator?

01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:31.676
You went through New Brunswick?
The SERE school they run up there.

01:05:31.809 --> 01:05:32.876
I did.

01:05:33.009 --> 01:05:34.043
I take it
you didn't enjoy it.

01:05:34.175 --> 01:05:35.609
What's not to enjoy?

01:05:35.742 --> 01:05:37.442
Three nights in the hole
with a bucket to piss in,

01:05:37.575 --> 01:05:39.475
and they pump in chainsaws
and crying babies

01:05:39.609 --> 01:05:41.776
through the speakers
24 hours a day.

01:05:42.842 --> 01:05:44.509
End of training,
things get pretty loopy.

01:05:44.642 --> 01:05:46.609
You confess
to shooting Kennedy?

01:05:48.409 --> 01:05:50.275
No, sir, I did not.

01:05:50.409 --> 01:05:53.043
A couple of sleepless nights,
that's all.

01:05:53.175 --> 01:05:54.775
We pull from the same playbook.

01:05:55.775 --> 01:05:58.976
You and every other green Marine
made it out all right.

01:05:59.109 --> 01:06:00.542
They will too.

01:06:00.676 --> 01:06:02.842
Sir, the defense is gonna
play every card that they can.

01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:07.809
If they've got grounds to claim duress,
it's better I know about it now.

01:06:10.676 --> 01:06:13.143
Did the colonel tell you
why I wanted to see you?

01:06:13.275 --> 01:06:15.109
He did.
I told him to save you the trip.

01:06:15.242 --> 01:06:17.076
He said you wouldn't
take no for an answer,

01:06:17.208 --> 01:06:20.509
but I'm afraid
that's the answer I have.

01:06:20.642 --> 01:06:23.442
I'm enormously proud
of what goes on inside JTF,

01:06:23.575 --> 01:06:24.609
but my hands are tied.

01:06:24.742 --> 01:06:27.208
I am not at liberty
to share MFRs.

01:06:27.342 --> 01:06:30.175
Sir, if it is a clearance
issue, I am TS/SCI.

01:06:30.308 --> 01:06:32.175
It's an agency issue.

01:06:32.308 --> 01:06:34.542
But I was told specifically by the
agency that you're the man to see.

01:06:34.676 --> 01:06:38.542
That sounds like something
a spook would say, doesn't it?

01:06:52.043 --> 01:06:54.676
So, how was your trip?

01:06:58.976 --> 01:07:00.708
Not what I expected.

01:07:09.575 --> 01:07:11.842
Seven-sixty! Reservation.

01:07:16.942 --> 01:07:20.076
Seven-sixty, reservation.
Hurry the fuck up.

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:23.942
"Seven-sixty, reservation.
Hurry the fuck up."

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.676
Knock it off.
You're not a parrot.

01:07:32.509 --> 01:07:34.842
Not a motherfucker parrot.

01:07:34.976 --> 01:07:37.876
Come on, man. Get it together.
Let's go. Stand up.

01:07:39.642 --> 01:07:42.642
Turn around.

01:07:42.776 --> 01:07:44.475
Turn around.

01:07:45.442 --> 01:07:47.475
First, you tell me your name.

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.575
You know me one year,
I don't know your name.

01:07:51.375 --> 01:07:53.375
I'm not allowed to do that.
Turn around.

01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:02.942
"Turn around."

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:10.143
You're a good soldier,
like G.I. Joe.

01:08:12.709 --> 01:08:16.341
Don't lie.
Shut up. Shut up.

01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:28.475
Give me your hands. Move.

01:08:37.242 --> 01:08:39.341
What you doing,
motherfucker?

01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:23.676
- Voller!
- Goal!

01:09:29.242 --> 01:09:30.509
Mm.

01:10:34.509 --> 01:10:37.076
So you just decided
to become a fucking terrorist?

01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:40.542
No, no terrorist.

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:42.809
I speak English,
maybe...

01:10:43.942 --> 01:10:47.842
I go Afghanistan,
help Muslim against the communists.

01:10:48.609 --> 01:10:52.742
Americans fighting with us.
Same side.

01:10:52.876 --> 01:10:54.275
Same side.

01:10:54.409 --> 01:10:56.809
Who recruited you to Al-Qaeda?

01:10:56.942 --> 01:11:00.909
Same side. No one, me.
You no listen. Same side.

01:11:01.043 --> 01:11:05.809
I trained with Al-Qaeda for
a few months in 1990 and '92.

01:11:05.942 --> 01:11:08.809
- Bullshit.
- Then I left. That's it.

01:11:10.076 --> 01:11:13.876
So why did you delete all the
contacts in your cell phone, then?

01:11:14.776 --> 01:11:18.876
When you were arrested,
your phone was wiped.

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:20.976
How many time I say?

01:11:21.109 --> 01:11:24.308
Me no want trouble for friend
because of phone call.

01:11:24.442 --> 01:11:26.342
You are so sharp.

01:11:26.475 --> 01:11:28.009
Yeah. You got an answer
for everything.

01:11:28.143 --> 01:11:30.742
That must be why they gave you
that little scholarship, huh?

01:12:45.043 --> 01:12:46.776
<i>Oui.</i>

01:12:53.842 --> 01:12:55.208
Let's go.

01:12:57.076 --> 01:12:58.776
Move.

01:13:01.742 --> 01:13:02.609
Hey!

01:13:02.742 --> 01:13:04.409
Stop dragging. Come on.

01:13:04.542 --> 01:13:06.275
See you later, alligator.

01:13:11.876 --> 01:13:14.076
- Can I get you a water?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

01:13:21.676 --> 01:13:22.709
Hey, Nancy.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.375
- Miss Hollander.
- Nancy.

01:13:26.509 --> 01:13:28.342
- Frank.
- Go ahead, have a seat.

01:13:28.475 --> 01:13:32.809
Before we begin, I should warn
you, it's not gonna be a puff piece.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.409
Where shall we start?

01:13:35.542 --> 01:13:37.942
Well, people have called
you a terrorist lawyer.

01:13:39.509 --> 01:13:41.342
How do you respond
to that?

01:13:41.475 --> 01:13:45.043
Well, when I defended someone charged
with rape, nobody called me a rapist.

01:13:45.876 --> 01:13:47.942
When I defended
someone charged with murder,

01:13:48.076 --> 01:13:49.776
nobody dug around my backyard.

01:13:50.876 --> 01:13:52.742
But when someone's
accused of terrorism,

01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:55.642
people like you seem to think
that that's different.

01:13:55.776 --> 01:13:57.242
It's not.

01:13:57.375 --> 01:14:01.976
When I stand by my client and I
insist that he gets a fair hearing,

01:14:02.109 --> 01:14:05.509
I'm not just defending him.
I'm defending you and me.

01:14:05.642 --> 01:14:08.275
The constitution doesn't have an
asterisk at the end that says,

01:14:08.409 --> 01:14:10.642
"Terms and conditions apply."

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:16.475
See the <i>Journal</i> today, sir?

01:14:16.609 --> 01:14:17.542
Yeah.

01:14:17.676 --> 01:14:19.742
Can't believe
she sat down for this.

01:14:19.876 --> 01:14:21.375
It's a demolition job.

01:14:22.242 --> 01:14:25.043
No, what it is,
is a paradigm shift.

01:14:25.175 --> 01:14:28.342
Yesterday we were prosecuting
a 9/11 terror suspect,

01:14:28.475 --> 01:14:31.842
and now we're debating
the merits of habeas.

01:14:34.409 --> 01:14:35.709
Where's Arjun?

01:14:37.609 --> 01:14:39.143
That is unacceptable.
No, I don't wanna talk to you.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.308
I've told you five times.
Your pass has been revoked.

01:14:41.442 --> 01:14:43.509
- Call her again.
- Hey. What's going on?

01:14:43.642 --> 01:14:45.143
Sir, he's not cleared
to enter the building.

01:14:45.275 --> 01:14:46.909
They pulled my pass.

01:14:47.043 --> 01:14:48.909
- Just give us a moment.
- Sir, I have to insist that...

01:14:49.043 --> 01:14:50.275
Just a minute.

01:14:50.409 --> 01:14:52.109
- Who's "they"?
- I don't know.

01:14:52.242 --> 01:14:54.342
Someone revoked my clearance,
and I have orders to return to Lejeune.

01:14:54.475 --> 01:14:55.809
- What'd you do?
- Nothing.

01:14:55.942 --> 01:14:57.809
I sent out the information
requests you asked for.

01:14:57.942 --> 01:14:59.375
Who to?

01:14:59.509 --> 01:15:00.776
FBI, Langley, Interpol,
anybody who touched the MFRs.

01:15:00.909 --> 01:15:02.542
Sir. I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

01:15:02.676 --> 01:15:04.776
- You can't be here.
- Yeah, I'm going. I'm going.

01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:18.076
<i>So, I talked to
everyone, DGSE, DRM, Diplomatie.</i>

01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:20.642
<i>Nobody knows
about your guy from Marseille.</i>

01:15:20.776 --> 01:15:22.776
Well, maybe he's not
a French national.

01:15:22.909 --> 01:15:25.709
What about Moroccan,
Algerian, Tunisian?

01:15:26.275 --> 01:15:27.809
<i>No, I thought about that.</i>

01:15:27.942 --> 01:15:30.742
<i>SIS says all their nationals in
Guantánamo are accounted for.</i>

01:15:30.876 --> 01:15:32.809
<i>There is no record of 241.</i>

01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:35.642
Where did he go?

01:15:35.776 --> 01:15:38.242
<i>Nancy, maybe
he doesn't go anywhere.</i>

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:40.342
<i>Maybe he doesn't exist?</i>

01:15:40.942 --> 01:15:42.208
Maybe.

01:15:58.076 --> 01:15:59.509
Can I ask you
something?

01:16:00.742 --> 01:16:03.709
My friend,
his number is 241.

01:16:03.842 --> 01:16:06.776
I don't see him for a long time.
You know where he is?

01:16:06.909 --> 01:16:09.575
I can't talk to you
about other detainees, Mo.

01:16:11.143 --> 01:16:12.776
What happened to him?

01:16:15.009 --> 01:16:18.842
Steve, please.
He has a wife and children.

01:16:21.776 --> 01:16:25.475
241 was found dead
in his cell last month.

01:16:27.776 --> 01:16:28.809
What?

01:16:31.409 --> 01:16:33.175
Dead from what?

01:16:35.175 --> 01:16:36.676
Self-asphyxiation.

01:16:38.609 --> 01:16:41.842
Sorry, bro.
I know you were close.

01:18:15.909 --> 01:18:18.909
USA! Remember 9/11!

01:18:19.043 --> 01:18:24.175
Remember 9/11! USA! USA!

01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:25.242
Remember 9/11.

01:18:25.375 --> 01:18:26.409
Lawyer scum.

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:28.909
Remember 9/11.

01:18:30.208 --> 01:18:33.642
USA! Remember 9/11!

01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:35.275
You okay?

01:18:35.909 --> 01:18:36.909
I'll be fine.

01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:39.709
- Sure?
- Yeah.

01:18:43.342 --> 01:18:46.676
<i>The government does not object
to the defense's right to disclosure.</i>

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:50.375
But clearing classified evidence is
an extremely time-consuming process.

01:18:50.509 --> 01:18:52.942
We simply need more time,
Your Honor.

01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:57.609
Thank you, Mr. Patton.
Miss Hollander?

01:19:00.575 --> 01:19:06.409
If the government has uniquely complicated
issues clearing classified evidence,

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:08.375
those are issues
of its own making, Your Honor.

01:19:08.509 --> 01:19:11.976
Mr. Slahi has been spirited
across borders,

01:19:12.109 --> 01:19:13.409
he has been interrogated,

01:19:13.542 --> 01:19:16.409
he has been held against
his will for six years

01:19:16.542 --> 01:19:18.175
without a single charge
being laid against him.

01:19:18.308 --> 01:19:23.709
Now, the Supreme Court said it
will not tolerate further delay

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:26.876
when it ordered
these habeas cases to proceed.

01:19:27.009 --> 01:19:30.175
The government's had
plenty of time, Your Honor.

01:19:31.942 --> 01:19:34.575
I'm inclined to agree
with Miss Hollander.

01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:36.609
The government
has ten days to file,

01:19:36.742 --> 01:19:39.742
or it will find itself
back in my courtroom.

01:19:45.076 --> 01:19:46.876
Well, you asked for it.

01:19:47.009 --> 01:19:48.375
Happy reading.

01:20:06.143 --> 01:20:07.375
Fuck.

01:20:09.143 --> 01:20:10.709
He fucking confessed.

01:20:11.609 --> 01:20:12.642
To what?

01:20:16.776 --> 01:20:17.809
To everything.

01:20:17.942 --> 01:20:21.076
To financing 9/11,
to recruiting the hijackers.

01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:24.776
He fucking wrote a spreadsheet on
the inner workings of Al-Qaeda.

01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:29.175
Why didn't he tell us
that he confessed?

01:20:32.009 --> 01:20:35.876
It's not the first time in history
that a client's lied to his lawyers.

01:20:37.143 --> 01:20:39.175
Look at this. Look at all of this.
Look at this one.

01:20:39.308 --> 01:20:42.676
He admits to acquiring
explosives to blow up LAX.

01:20:42.809 --> 01:20:44.676
The millennium plot?

01:20:44.809 --> 01:20:46.076
What's your point?

01:20:46.242 --> 01:20:48.208
He's guilty!
He's fucking guilty!

01:20:48.976 --> 01:20:50.009
Maybe he is.

01:20:51.009 --> 01:20:52.875
And he still has
a right to counsel.

01:20:53.009 --> 01:20:54.375
I'm not saying
that he doesn't.

01:20:54.509 --> 01:20:56.776
I'm saying that he helped
to kill 3,000 civilians,

01:20:56.909 --> 01:20:58.976
and we're doing everything
we can to get him out.

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:00.809
Yeah,
we're doing our job.

01:21:00.942 --> 01:21:04.976
I did bake sales for his legal fund.
That's not a part of my job.

01:21:05.109 --> 01:21:07.842
My dad told me I'm not welcome
home for Thanksgiving this year.

01:21:07.976 --> 01:21:09.842
That's not a part of my job.

01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:12.776
Get out.

01:21:12.909 --> 01:21:14.475
What?

01:21:14.609 --> 01:21:18.609
You want turkey and pumpkin pie
with Mom and Dad and Uncle Joe?

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.009
Go on, get out.
Go home.

01:21:22.076 --> 01:21:26.076
You can't win a case if you
don't believe your own shit.

01:21:27.409 --> 01:21:31.475
- I'm not trying to leave, I'm just...
- Stop fucking wasting my time.

01:21:31.609 --> 01:21:32.742
Get out.

01:22:21.609 --> 01:22:23.509
It's our goodbye party.

01:22:24.575 --> 01:22:26.409
Who's going home,
me or you?

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:31.208
Military intelligence thinks
we're wasting our time,

01:22:31.342 --> 01:22:33.409
so they're gonna take over,

01:22:33.542 --> 01:22:35.609
see if they can't
get you to cooperate.

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:37.609
I cooperate.
I tell you everything.

01:22:37.742 --> 01:22:40.375
Not according
to Ramzi bin al-Shibh.

01:22:41.208 --> 01:22:42.609
Last chance, Mohamedou.

01:22:42.742 --> 01:22:44.542
A hundred times
I tell you.

01:22:45.776 --> 01:22:48.009
He stayed in my house
one night.

01:22:48.143 --> 01:22:50.043
I don't know him,
never knew him.

01:22:50.175 --> 01:22:53.842
Next time I hear about him,
he's telling you guys crazy lies about me.

01:22:53.976 --> 01:22:56.976
Yeah, well, you're tired of saying
it, we're tired of hearing it.

01:22:57.109 --> 01:22:59.043
Military
wants a crack at you.

01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:00.542
You should know...

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:05.342
once MI takes over,
your sessions won't be as friendly.

01:23:06.175 --> 01:23:08.575
What, no tea? No cake?

01:23:16.308 --> 01:23:17.542
Good luck, Mo.

01:23:18.409 --> 01:23:21.742
All I can tell ya...
be truthful.

01:23:35.542 --> 01:23:37.409
Give me your left arm.

01:23:39.909 --> 01:23:40.942
Hey!

01:23:44.809 --> 01:23:46.442
What are you doing?

01:23:48.308 --> 01:23:52.475
No. No. No. No!

01:23:55.475 --> 01:23:57.175
Where are you taking me?

01:24:04.909 --> 01:24:06.308
Where's Teri?

01:24:08.475 --> 01:24:11.442
- Moved on.
- What?

01:24:13.175 --> 01:24:14.409
Teri was fun.

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:16.876
Now I'm stuck
with only you.

01:24:19.442 --> 01:24:21.642
She doesn't want to be
a lawyer no more?

01:24:22.642 --> 01:24:24.009
She moved on from your case.

01:24:26.208 --> 01:24:28.076
So, we won the motion
to compel,

01:24:28.208 --> 01:24:31.809
and the government's released all the
evidence that they have against you.

01:24:33.109 --> 01:24:34.442
Good.

01:24:35.475 --> 01:24:37.375
That's what we wanted,
right?

01:24:38.776 --> 01:24:41.375
All the evidence,
including your confessions.

01:24:44.409 --> 01:24:46.275
Why didn't you tell us?

01:24:46.409 --> 01:24:49.375
They're nothing.
Like fantasy...

01:24:51.175 --> 01:24:53.642
- None of that happened.
- You signed them.

01:24:53.776 --> 01:24:55.409
They made me.

01:24:56.509 --> 01:24:58.143
They "made" you,
as in they coerced you?

01:24:58.275 --> 01:24:59.642
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

01:24:59.776 --> 01:25:02.308
- You tell me. They coerced you?
- Shh.

01:25:03.409 --> 01:25:05.242
You gotta tell me what happened,
Mohamedou.

01:25:05.375 --> 01:25:09.342
You're asking me to set fire to this
place but I'm still sitting in it.

01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:11.509
Well, then write it down.
All right?

01:25:11.642 --> 01:25:14.342
That's what the pages are for.
Write it down.

01:25:14.475 --> 01:25:16.175
You need to tell me the truth.

01:25:16.308 --> 01:25:18.709
You need to tell me what happened to
you, or I can't defend you.

01:25:18.842 --> 01:25:21.342
- Do you understand that?
- I don't need to tell you nothing!

01:25:21.475 --> 01:25:24.976
Whatever I say,
it doesn't matter.

01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:27.709
This fucking island,
I'm dying here!

01:25:29.842 --> 01:25:33.542
Outside, my family, my brother,
their lives go on.

01:25:34.442 --> 01:25:36.076
Teri's life goes on.

01:25:36.208 --> 01:25:38.409
But me, here,
I'm like a statue.

01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:42.009
And you will leave too,
and your life will go on.

01:25:42.143 --> 01:25:43.542
My life?

01:25:43.676 --> 01:25:45.842
What the hell
do you know about my life?

01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:48.109
This is it. This is my life.

01:25:48.242 --> 01:25:51.175
I spend my time in places like
this helping people like you.

01:25:51.308 --> 01:25:52.809
That's what I do.

01:25:52.942 --> 01:25:55.776
So don't question my commitment
to your case.

01:25:55.909 --> 01:25:57.409
The case.

01:25:57.542 --> 01:25:59.242
The case, the case.

01:26:01.976 --> 01:26:03.442
You're not committed to me.

01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:05.509
A person!

01:26:07.575 --> 01:26:08.742
You think I'm guilty.

01:26:08.876 --> 01:26:10.342
Say it.

01:26:10.475 --> 01:26:12.776
I mean, you believe I did
all these things, so...

01:26:12.909 --> 01:26:15.308
why the fuck are you here?

01:26:16.575 --> 01:26:18.308
Explain to me, really.

01:26:18.442 --> 01:26:21.876
You gave up your life to sit
with such an evil guy like me?

01:26:28.842 --> 01:26:30.076
Explain to me.

01:26:30.842 --> 01:26:32.809
Everybody has the right
to counsel.

01:26:36.043 --> 01:26:38.175
You need to tell me the truth.

01:26:38.308 --> 01:26:40.242
You need to write it down.

01:26:40.375 --> 01:26:42.642
If you can do that,
then I'll be back.

01:26:43.776 --> 01:26:44.842
And if not...

01:26:45.942 --> 01:26:47.642
I'll find you another lawyer.

01:26:47.776 --> 01:26:48.609
I'm ready.

01:27:06.442 --> 01:27:07.876
Merry Christmas, Theo.

01:27:08.009 --> 01:27:09.342
Merry Christmas, Nancy.

01:27:40.409 --> 01:27:41.642
Hi, Stu.

01:27:42.575 --> 01:27:45.676
Hey, Hannah. I didn't know
you guys were coming.

01:27:45.809 --> 01:27:50.275
Nearly didn't. The I-83 was closed
all the way north of Baltimore.

01:27:50.409 --> 01:27:51.876
I'm so glad
you made it in one piece.

01:27:52.009 --> 01:27:54.809
Well, Neil was driving like
he was back at flight school,

01:27:54.942 --> 01:27:56.742
the way he was hitting
those country roads.

01:27:56.876 --> 01:27:59.509
- Where is Neil?
- He's around here somewhere.

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:01.742
I'll go and find him.
You look great, by the way.

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:04.475
He doesn't
even say that to me.

01:28:04.609 --> 01:28:06.275
Oh, I do.

01:28:19.609 --> 01:28:21.742
How's it going, Stu?

01:28:22.542 --> 01:28:24.342
Glad I ran into you.

01:28:24.475 --> 01:28:27.109
Been a fruitless endeavor trying
to get through to your office.

01:28:27.242 --> 01:28:29.509
Well, what can I say?
It's been busy.

01:28:29.642 --> 01:28:31.609
Well, I went down
to Gitmo...

01:28:32.542 --> 01:28:34.976
just like you said,
and I didn't like what I saw.

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:39.375
The general's just about
the same closed door as you.

01:28:39.509 --> 01:28:42.175
Come on, man. It's a party.
Enjoy yourself.

01:28:42.308 --> 01:28:43.909
Why are you
jerking me around?

01:28:45.409 --> 01:28:50.342
Look, I know it was your people
who took Arjun off the task force.

01:28:54.876 --> 01:28:57.709
You know, I've never been
part of a conspiracy,

01:28:57.842 --> 01:29:00.442
but I'm starting to think that
this is what it must feel like

01:29:00.575 --> 01:29:01.909
to be
on the outside of one.

01:29:02.043 --> 01:29:03.876
I'm sorry, what exactly
are you accusing me of?

01:29:04.009 --> 01:29:08.375
Hell, I don't even know because
no one is telling me anything.

01:29:09.442 --> 01:29:13.009
Without those MFRs,
my case is a bust.

01:29:13.143 --> 01:29:14.409
You're overthinking this,
sport.

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:17.242
Either wear the jersey
or get off the field.

01:29:17.375 --> 01:29:19.575
My charge
is to get Slahi the needle.

01:29:20.742 --> 01:29:23.876
No one else is gonna walk in
there, not you, not POTUS.

01:29:24.009 --> 01:29:25.409
That's on me.

01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:27.642
And if I'm wrong,
when it comes to my reckoning,

01:29:27.776 --> 01:29:29.409
I'm the one that'll
have to answer for it.

01:29:29.542 --> 01:29:31.642
And who's gonna answer
for Bruce?

01:29:31.776 --> 01:29:34.308
- You're gonna bring his name into this?
- No.

01:29:34.442 --> 01:29:36.609
You don't know what we know.

01:29:36.742 --> 01:29:40.742
United flight 175, based on
evidence gathered from the wreckage,

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:43.809
the first thing those terrorists
did was slash up a flight attendant

01:29:43.942 --> 01:29:48.308
to elicit the copilot, Bruce, to open
the cockpit door and come to her rescue.

01:29:48.442 --> 01:29:50.409
And then they slit his throat
with a box cutter

01:29:50.542 --> 01:29:53.575
and let him bleed to death on the
flight deck as the plane hit the tower.

01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:57.409
Now, someone
has to answer for that.

01:29:58.976 --> 01:30:00.208
Someone...

01:30:02.876 --> 01:30:04.308
not just anyone.

01:30:06.409 --> 01:30:08.308
Happy fucking holiday.

01:30:19.542 --> 01:30:21.242
You killed them, Mohamedou.

01:30:22.242 --> 01:30:24.009
<i>What does it feel like</i>

01:30:24.143 --> 01:30:28.242
<i>to have the blood of 3,000
innocent lives all over your hands?</i>

01:30:32.809 --> 01:30:34.275
<i>Welcome back to</i> E! News.

01:30:34.409 --> 01:30:35.709
<i>You know, the buzz</i>
<i>surrounding the new</i> 90210

01:30:35.842 --> 01:30:38.076
<i>isn't just about the cobbler
at the Peach Pit.</i>

01:30:38.208 --> 01:30:41.143
<i>Very true. There has been
a skinny scandal brewing for a while,</i>

01:30:41.275 --> 01:30:44.509
<i>and now one of the show's stars
is speaking out about her body...</i>

01:31:15.842 --> 01:31:19.442
This is not my cell.
Hey! This is not my cell!

01:31:19.575 --> 01:31:20.809
Well, it is now.

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:23.409
It's too cold! Hey!

01:31:25.942 --> 01:31:27.175
Where's my Quran?

01:31:27.942 --> 01:31:29.375
Where are my things?

01:31:29.876 --> 01:31:31.375
Hey, listen to me!

01:31:33.208 --> 01:31:34.909
Hey.

01:31:35.043 --> 01:31:36.375
Please.

01:31:37.609 --> 01:31:38.676
It's cold.

01:32:17.175 --> 01:32:19.842
The week that Slahi was handed
over to military intelligence,

01:32:19.976 --> 01:32:25.509
we received sign-off from Donald Rumsfeld
authorizing the use of special measures.

01:32:27.043 --> 01:32:28.709
And you just
went along with it?

01:32:31.375 --> 01:32:32.676
Yes, I did.

01:32:32.809 --> 01:32:36.174
We were trying
to prevent a second 9/11.

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:47.475
That's Bob. He works here.
He can take you to read the MFRs.

01:32:56.275 --> 01:32:57.509
Thank you.

01:33:20.009 --> 01:33:21.842
I'll be right out here,
sir.

01:34:43.308 --> 01:34:45.342
We're gonna break you,
scumbag.

01:34:48.442 --> 01:34:52.175
What are you doing
down there, buddy? Get up!

01:34:54.076 --> 01:34:56.976
- <i>It hurts.</i>
- <i>Get the fuck up!</i>

01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:14.709
I know you want me.

01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:18.575
Are you praying?

01:35:21.475 --> 01:35:24.942
I want you to fuck me.
Do you hear me?

01:35:27.409 --> 01:35:29.409
Fucking look at me!

01:35:29.542 --> 01:35:30.776
I know you want me.

01:35:30.909 --> 01:35:33.976
I know you want me.
You're gonna fuck me.

01:35:40.876 --> 01:35:42.409
I know you want me.

01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:49.942
Oh, yeah!

01:36:03.275 --> 01:36:04.742
Two thousand eighty-one.

01:36:06.375 --> 01:36:08.308
Two thousand eighty-two.

01:36:09.409 --> 01:36:11.642
- Mohamedou.
- <i>Two thousand eighty-three.</i>

01:36:13.043 --> 01:36:15.442
Get up!

01:36:18.409 --> 01:36:20.575
<i>Two thousand eighty-five...</i>

01:36:42.475 --> 01:36:44.842
Since you
refused to cooperate,

01:36:44.976 --> 01:36:48.475
the US government is authorized
to arrest your mother...

01:36:49.742 --> 01:36:51.542
and bring her
into this facility.

01:36:54.076 --> 01:36:55.642
I mean, you can save her.

01:36:57.275 --> 01:36:59.375
But you need to decide.

01:37:00.842 --> 01:37:04.809
Do you wanna be
a defendant or a witness?

01:37:06.175 --> 01:37:07.942
I can't be a witness.

01:37:10.976 --> 01:37:12.575
I can't be a witness.

01:37:21.275 --> 01:37:23.208
Were you expecting
someone?

01:37:26.208 --> 01:37:27.143
I don't know.

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:28.809
Maybe it's your friend.

01:37:30.143 --> 01:37:31.509
Go answer it.

01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:36.876
Yeah. Go on.

01:37:51.809 --> 01:37:53.175
Mohamedou?

01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:29.876
That's it?
That's what happened?

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:36.542
There has been confusion.

01:38:55.375 --> 01:38:58.409
That's not true.
That's not true.

01:39:00.842 --> 01:39:01.642
What?

01:39:01.776 --> 01:39:04.242
Hey, Mohamedou.
Have some cake.

01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:05.742
I'm not hungry.

01:39:06.942 --> 01:39:09.542
Eat when I tell you to.

01:39:09.676 --> 01:39:13.575
One. Eat when I tell you to.
Two. Eat when I tell you to.

01:39:14.275 --> 01:39:16.475
Three. Eat when I tell you to.

01:39:16.609 --> 01:39:20.942
You eat when I say you eat!
You shit when I say you shit!

01:39:22.976 --> 01:39:24.242
You understand me?

01:39:25.208 --> 01:39:27.642
Do not fucking sit down on me,
asshole!

01:40:22.876 --> 01:40:26.676
Four thousand one hundred holes.
Four thousand one hundred holes.

01:40:26.809 --> 01:40:30.642
Four thousand one hundred holes.
Four thousand one hundred holes.

01:40:30.776 --> 01:40:32.876
Don't you wanna go home?

01:40:34.609 --> 01:40:39.242
You know, if you talk,
I can help you get outta here.

01:40:39.375 --> 01:40:41.242
How many days...

01:40:41.375 --> 01:40:44.909
I have been... special project?

01:40:45.043 --> 01:40:47.776
No, not days.

01:40:49.842 --> 01:40:51.275
You've been here months.

01:41:05.342 --> 01:41:07.208
We need this to stop.

01:41:08.842 --> 01:41:11.308
You need to tell us
what you know.

01:41:13.676 --> 01:41:14.676
Please.

01:41:15.442 --> 01:41:17.375
Wait,
what are you doing?

01:41:17.509 --> 01:41:19.175
You're gone, motherfucker!

01:41:19.308 --> 01:41:23.475
What are you doing? This is my session!
What the fuck are you doing?

01:41:23.609 --> 01:41:25.375
Get him outta here!

01:41:26.143 --> 01:41:27.342
Stop it!

01:42:18.842 --> 01:42:21.342
Your mother
has been detained, Mohamedou.

01:42:23.208 --> 01:42:24.642
You see this letter?

01:42:26.208 --> 01:42:28.475
This is from
the Department of Defense.

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:32.475
Her transfer to Guantánamo
has been approved.

01:42:34.809 --> 01:42:35.809
I gotta tell you...

01:42:37.175 --> 01:42:42.208
I have concerns about her safety
in this all-male environment.

01:42:42.342 --> 01:42:44.609
This is your last chance.

01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:31.776
Sir...

01:43:34.742 --> 01:43:38.609
You tell... Captain Collins...

01:43:44.542 --> 01:43:47.308
I would like to confess.

01:44:53.308 --> 01:44:54.842
Hey. You okay?

01:44:56.076 --> 01:44:57.776
How soon can you
clear these pages?

01:44:58.809 --> 01:45:00.109
Is that Mo?

01:45:00.242 --> 01:45:01.942
What's the news from Cuba?

01:45:02.076 --> 01:45:05.542
Look, these pages, they put my client
in a really vulnerable position.

01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:08.776
So they need to be handled
with sensitivity.

01:45:30.375 --> 01:45:33.776
I much prefer
these civilized conversations.

01:45:35.575 --> 01:45:38.742
I'm very happy with
your cooperation, Mohamedou.

01:45:41.143 --> 01:45:44.809
But I think you've only
provided 85% of what you know.

01:45:45.876 --> 01:45:48.342
I'm sure you'll provide us
with the rest.

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:51.709
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:46:04.009 --> 01:46:05.242
Now...

01:46:07.009 --> 01:46:08.242
I can sleep?

01:46:09.842 --> 01:46:12.575
Yeah, you can sleep now.

01:46:41.076 --> 01:46:44.842
The grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ, the love of God,

01:46:44.976 --> 01:46:48.275
and the fellowship of the
Holy Spirit be with you all.

01:46:48.876 --> 01:46:50.642
And also with you.

01:46:50.776 --> 01:46:53.876
Will you persevere
in resisting evil

01:46:54.009 --> 01:46:58.809
and whenever you fall into sin,
repent and return to the Lord?

01:46:58.942 --> 01:47:01.642
- I will with God's help.
- I will with God's help.

01:47:01.776 --> 01:47:05.575
Will you do everything in
your power to seek justice on Earth

01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:10.143
and treat every human being
with inherent human dignity?

01:47:10.275 --> 01:47:12.742
I will with God's help.

01:47:21.676 --> 01:47:22.709
Sir.

01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:30.043
Is this
an inside-in-the-warm issue

01:47:30.175 --> 01:47:32.375
or a standing-out-in-the-cold
issue?

01:47:32.509 --> 01:47:35.809
We can't prosecute Slahi.
We don't have the evidence.

01:47:35.942 --> 01:47:39.076
You have multiple signed confessions.
What more could you need?

01:47:39.208 --> 01:47:40.509
It was given under duress.

01:47:40.642 --> 01:47:42.542
Fruit from the poisonous tree.

01:47:42.676 --> 01:47:46.609
He spent 70 days
in special projects, tortured.

01:47:46.742 --> 01:47:48.342
Not a single word he said
is admissible.

01:47:48.475 --> 01:47:50.308
No, that's what
they're trained to say.

01:47:50.442 --> 01:47:53.242
AQ laid it all out
in the Manchester Protocols.

01:47:53.375 --> 01:47:54.976
The second you're detained,
claim torture.

01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:58.676
This didn't come from AQ, sir.
This is coming from our side.

01:47:58.809 --> 01:48:00.242
Now, I read the MFRs.

01:48:00.375 --> 01:48:05.241
This guy, Captain Collins,
some Navy reservist, he ran the program.

01:48:05.375 --> 01:48:09.642
Sleep deprivation, waterboarding,
stress positions, flat-out assault.

01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:13.143
He specifically threatened to have
Slahi's mother shipped to Gitmo

01:48:13.275 --> 01:48:15.076
to have her raped
by other detainees.

01:48:15.208 --> 01:48:17.009
And it is all documented.

01:48:17.143 --> 01:48:22.275
It's systemic, OSD-approved.
Donald Rumsfeld signed the top sheet.

01:48:22.409 --> 01:48:23.976
What's been done here
is reprehensible!

01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:28.409
I don't wanna hear another word
about detainee treatment.

01:48:29.709 --> 01:48:32.909
Your job
is to bring charges.

01:48:34.475 --> 01:48:37.208
Let a judge decide
what's admissible.

01:48:38.642 --> 01:48:41.342
Sir, I refuse
to prosecute this case.

01:48:41.475 --> 01:48:43.043
As a Christian, as a lawyer...

01:48:43.175 --> 01:48:45.575
What makes you think you're
any better than the rest of us?

01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:49.175
I don't think I'm better than anybody else!
That is the point!

01:48:49.308 --> 01:48:53.709
Now, we all took an oath to support
and defend the Constitution.

01:48:53.842 --> 01:48:56.942
At the very least,
we are miles away from that.

01:49:01.976 --> 01:49:03.575
You're a traitor.

01:49:05.275 --> 01:49:06.642
What?

01:49:35.342 --> 01:49:36.575
So, I...

01:49:38.076 --> 01:49:39.342
I reviewed
your correspondence,

01:49:39.475 --> 01:49:42.442
and I think
there are strong grounds

01:49:42.575 --> 01:49:46.475
for making the government's
evidence against you inadmissible.

01:49:49.009 --> 01:49:50.609
And you're still my lawyer?

01:49:51.275 --> 01:49:53.342
Very much so.

01:49:55.575 --> 01:49:58.676
I'd like you to consider
releasing your letters.

01:50:00.842 --> 01:50:01.876
To a newspaper?

01:50:03.242 --> 01:50:04.542
Maybe a book.

01:50:06.509 --> 01:50:09.143
People need to read your
story for themselves.

01:50:09.275 --> 01:50:12.842
And it'll put pressure on the
government to give us a court date.

01:50:18.909 --> 01:50:20.308
I'm ready for that.

01:50:23.409 --> 01:50:25.043
Would you like me
to step outside?

01:50:25.175 --> 01:50:26.842
No, keep going.

01:50:28.175 --> 01:50:29.409
You don't wanna pray?

01:50:30.475 --> 01:50:32.575
Are you religious now?

01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:33.742
Why do you care?

01:50:34.776 --> 01:50:35.842
I don't.

01:50:37.342 --> 01:50:39.375
I care about you.

01:50:42.208 --> 01:50:46.475
What do you want me to sign, Nancy?
Who am I suing today? God?

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:49.609
No one today.

01:50:52.842 --> 01:50:54.208
Then why are you here?

01:50:57.909 --> 01:50:59.342
No reason in particular.

01:51:01.076 --> 01:51:02.842
I just didn't want you
to be alone.

01:51:30.175 --> 01:51:31.609
- Sir.
- Sir.

01:51:36.575 --> 01:51:38.175
Traitor.

01:51:39.409 --> 01:51:40.676
Sir.

01:51:53.842 --> 01:51:55.676
Thanks for schlepping
all the way out here.

01:51:55.809 --> 01:51:57.275
No problem.

01:51:57.409 --> 01:51:59.542
I'm not really that much
of a welcome presence

01:51:59.676 --> 01:52:01.709
anywhere inside
of the Beltway, so...

01:52:01.842 --> 01:52:03.008
Can I get one of them?

01:52:03.942 --> 01:52:06.642
I wanted to thank you.
You did the right thing.

01:52:06.776 --> 01:52:09.676
Yeah, well, my Christmas list
just got a little shorter.

01:52:09.809 --> 01:52:10.942
That's for sure.

01:52:11.076 --> 01:52:12.742
Can't be any shorter
than mine.

01:52:14.308 --> 01:52:18.942
Well, God pays for what He orders.
One way or another, He'll make it work.

01:52:19.076 --> 01:52:20.776
Here you go, sir.

01:52:20.909 --> 01:52:22.308
You really believe that?

01:52:23.876 --> 01:52:24.909
I do.

01:52:27.375 --> 01:52:31.475
You know, I think I figured out
why they built the camp down there.

01:52:31.609 --> 01:52:33.409
And we were both wrong.

01:52:33.542 --> 01:52:36.876
It's not the detainees they were
trying to keep out of the courts.

01:52:37.009 --> 01:52:38.709
It's the jailers.

01:52:38.842 --> 01:52:42.342
My client, he's not a suspect.
He's a witness.

01:52:45.509 --> 01:52:48.676
Did you ever open up
factual return box 32?

01:52:49.776 --> 01:52:53.143
It's just labeled
"Translations," but look inside.

01:52:53.275 --> 01:52:55.676
I think you might like
what you see.

01:52:56.175 --> 01:52:58.308
Box 32. Okay.

01:52:59.409 --> 01:53:00.776
When's the court date?

01:53:01.909 --> 01:53:03.308
Couple of weeks.

01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:07.342
Judge Robertson.
He's a tough judge.

01:53:07.976 --> 01:53:09.242
Sure is.

01:53:09.375 --> 01:53:10.876
Convince him,
you've convinced me.

01:53:13.009 --> 01:53:14.609
I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:53:14.742 --> 01:53:18.442
If there's any untainted
evidence that Slahi's guilty,

01:53:18.575 --> 01:53:21.308
I'll stick the needle
in his arm myself.

01:53:22.342 --> 01:53:23.942
I'd expect nothing less.

01:53:50.742 --> 01:53:51.809
Come in.

01:53:56.342 --> 01:53:58.742
He passed the polygraph,
twice.

01:53:58.876 --> 01:54:02.342
Hard to beat the lie
detector even once.

01:54:02.475 --> 01:54:06.742
Won't stand up in court,
but, yeah, it's nice to know.

01:54:07.909 --> 01:54:09.842
Box 32. We missed it.

01:54:12.043 --> 01:54:13.342
Who's that?

01:54:16.009 --> 01:54:17.809
That's Marseille.

01:54:17.942 --> 01:54:22.208
His real name is Ahmed Jabar.
The IRC helped me find his wife, Samia.

01:54:22.642 --> 01:54:23.575
Widow.

01:54:23.709 --> 01:54:24.876
Widow.

01:54:29.242 --> 01:54:30.776
Wait. Where are you going?

01:54:30.909 --> 01:54:34.509
Come on in. Close the door.
We got a lot of work to do.

01:54:47.242 --> 01:54:51.642
Nancy Hollander and Theresa Duncan
with the ACLU represent the petitioner.

01:54:51.776 --> 01:54:55.442
Joseph Folio and Robert Patton
represent the respondent.

01:54:57.175 --> 01:54:58.676
Good morning,
everybody.

01:55:00.043 --> 01:55:01.976
Good morning to Guantánamo.

01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:05.976
<i>We've had some preliminary discussion
of the procedures we'll follow today.</i>

01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:08.409
<i>Does the petitioner
have any questions?</i>

01:55:08.542 --> 01:55:09.942
What? He's asking me?

01:55:10.076 --> 01:55:11.976
- I am the petitioner?
- Yeah, it's you.

01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:14.009
<i>Yes.</i>

01:55:14.143 --> 01:55:15.742
What's he saying? I can't hear him.
Can you open that line a little wider?

01:55:15.876 --> 01:55:18.509
Why can't they hear me?
It all works here.

01:55:20.009 --> 01:55:21.109
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:55:21.242 --> 01:55:23.342
Yep, we're getting that now.
Yeah.

01:55:24.776 --> 01:55:26.375
<i>You can hear me now?</i>

01:55:26.509 --> 01:55:29.342
<i>We can all hear you, Mohamedou.</i>

01:55:29.475 --> 01:55:30.876
Are you certain, Nancy?

01:55:31.009 --> 01:55:33.475
<i>Yes. Don't worry.
Everyone can hear you.</i>

01:55:34.842 --> 01:55:39.442
Is the detainee gonna testify?
He understands he doesn't have to, yes?

01:55:39.575 --> 01:55:42.809
<i>Yes, Your Honor.
He wishes to testify.</i>

01:55:42.942 --> 01:55:46.442
He knows that he is fighting for his
life, and he has nothing to hide.

01:55:47.676 --> 01:55:50.175
Mr. Slahi, would you
please raise your right hand

01:55:50.308 --> 01:55:51.575
<i>and repeat after me?</i>

01:55:52.742 --> 01:55:54.143
- <i>"I..."</i>
- I...

01:55:54.275 --> 01:55:55.208
<i>State your name.</i>

01:55:55.342 --> 01:55:56.575
State your name.

01:55:57.909 --> 01:55:59.375
Say your name.

01:56:00.575 --> 01:56:02.542
Mohamedou Ould Slahi.

01:56:03.542 --> 01:56:05.342
"I solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

01:56:05.475 --> 01:56:08.043
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

01:56:08.175 --> 01:56:13.342
<i>I solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</i>

01:56:14.475 --> 01:56:16.275
<i>Go ahead, detainee.</i>

01:56:17.143 --> 01:56:18.442
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:56:32.876 --> 01:56:36.876
Where I'm from, we know
not to trust the police.

01:56:38.275 --> 01:56:43.776
We know the law is corrupt, and we know
the government using fear to control us.

01:56:46.109 --> 01:56:49.409
And when I moved to Germany
as a teenager,

01:56:49.542 --> 01:56:54.776
for the first time I experienced living
where people do not fear the police...

01:56:56.043 --> 01:56:58.475
where they believe
the law protects them.

01:57:00.076 --> 01:57:04.442
For me and for so many people in the
world, America is like this.

01:57:06.909 --> 01:57:11.942
Even in Mauritania, we have watched
<i>Law and Order</i> and <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

01:57:14.776 --> 01:57:17.442
And when I first arrive
at Guantánamo...

01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:21.709
I'm happy because I trusted
in American justice.

01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:24.776
<i>Never...</i>

01:57:24.909 --> 01:57:29.409
<i>Never did I believe I would be eight
years a prisoner without trial,</i>

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:36.842
and that the United States of America
would use fear and terror to control me.

01:57:41.375 --> 01:57:47.575
All my time here, I have been
told, "You are guilty.

01:57:48.609 --> 01:57:50.709
<i>You are guilty."</i>

01:57:52.175 --> 01:57:56.742
Not for something that I have
done or that has been proved...

01:57:58.043 --> 01:58:02.676
but because of suspicions
and associations.

01:58:06.942 --> 01:58:09.976
If you have a problem with
the United States of America,

01:58:10.109 --> 01:58:12.475
you will have
that problem forever.

01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:17.842
My captors cannot forgive me for
something that I have never done.

01:58:19.143 --> 01:58:21.409
But I am trying to forgive.

01:58:22.509 --> 01:58:24.308
I want to forgive...

01:58:26.375 --> 01:58:30.809
because that is what Allah,
my God, wants.

01:58:34.308 --> 01:58:40.242
<i>For this reason, I do not hold a grudge
against those who abused me, you know.</i>

01:58:44.776 --> 01:58:49.342
In Arabic, the word for "free"
and the word for "forgiveness"

01:58:49.475 --> 01:58:51.409
is the same word.

01:58:52.308 --> 01:58:56.809
<i>This is how, even here,
I can be free.</i>

01:59:01.043 --> 01:59:04.842
<i>For eight years, I have been
dreaming of being in a courtroom...</i>

01:59:06.175 --> 01:59:10.609
and now that I'm here, really...
I am scared to death.

01:59:11.208 --> 01:59:12.676
But...

01:59:16.742 --> 01:59:19.909
But I hope
I can find peace.

01:59:21.742 --> 01:59:22.976
<i>Because...</i>

01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:25.876
<i>I believe this court
is guided by law...</i>

01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:28.942
not fear.

01:59:30.208 --> 01:59:31.475
So...

01:59:33.442 --> 01:59:35.876
whatever you decide,
Your Honor...

01:59:37.143 --> 01:59:38.742
<i>I can accept it.</i>

01:59:42.409 --> 01:59:46.676
May God forgive us,
and may God be with us.

02:00:02.409 --> 02:00:03.676
They heard me?

02:00:13.242 --> 02:00:14.575
Mail for 760.

02:00:44.776 --> 02:00:46.609
Oh, shit.

02:00:51.942 --> 02:00:53.208
Guys.

02:00:56.242 --> 02:00:57.809
I won.

02:00:57.942 --> 02:00:59.876
- What?
- What?

02:01:00.009 --> 02:01:02.275
I won my case.

02:01:02.409 --> 02:01:05.308
Look, it's written here.
I'm going home!

02:01:05.442 --> 02:01:06.742
Good, man.

02:01:06.876 --> 02:01:08.143
Yeah, man.

02:01:08.275 --> 02:01:09.575
Fuck.

02:01:12.208 --> 02:01:14.242
Going home! Freedom!

02:01:45.809 --> 02:01:48.942
<i>Seven-sixty, are you ready?</i>

02:01:53.642 --> 02:01:54.809
Turn around.

02:01:56.976 --> 02:01:59.175
Here we go.

02:03:07.143 --> 02:03:09.308
See you later, alligator.

02:04:52.642 --> 02:04:56.208
<i>I just had something
made for them locally...</i>

02:04:57.842 --> 02:05:00.709
<i>to engrave their names
in Arabic.</i>

02:05:03.043 --> 02:05:08.809
<i>Something very symbolic,
but something that doesn't wear away,</i>

02:05:08.942 --> 02:05:11.809
<i>just like our friendship
wouldn't wear away.</i>

02:05:11.942 --> 02:05:14.109
Thank you, Mohamedou.

02:05:14.242 --> 02:05:16.642
Teri, Teri, Teri, Teri.

02:05:19.575 --> 02:05:21.409
- Can you make yourself...
- Well, I want...

02:05:21.542 --> 02:05:22.842
This is my <i>Buch.</i>

02:05:24.208 --> 02:05:26.976
<i>"Das Guantánamo-tagebuch."</i>

02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:28.542
This is French.

02:05:31.909 --> 02:05:32.842
This is Turkish.

02:05:36.208 --> 02:05:40.742
I don't know what language this,
but I would say this is Swedish.

02:05:41.842 --> 02:05:42.876
This is Danish.

02:05:44.742 --> 02:05:46.642
This is Italian.

02:05:47.575 --> 02:05:51.676
They really did a very good job
in hiding a lot.

02:05:51.809 --> 02:05:53.342
Look at here.

02:05:54.776 --> 02:05:55.809
Look.

02:05:57.942 --> 02:05:59.842
Bob Dylan song.
