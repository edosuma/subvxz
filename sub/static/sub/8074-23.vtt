[music playing]

00:03.704 --> 00:05.973
[theme music]

00:07.908 --> 00:08.809
All righty.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.445
My husband and
I'll see you then.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.148
[sigh] You ever done
something like this?

00:14.182 --> 00:17.318
You and Dan ever been
to a couples' therapist?

00:17.351 --> 00:20.054
No, but we did get in a fight
at a hockey game one time.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.223
Guy had to separate us.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.159
I really think this is the
best way to fix my marriage.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.294
Well, I really wouldn't know.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.929
Because in this family,
we fix our own problems.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.665
We use no psychiatrists,
no therapists,

00:31.699 --> 00:35.603
no educated people of any kind.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.804
How's DJ doing up there?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.572
Well, for a boy going
to his first school dance,

00:38.606 --> 00:39.840
pretty good.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.842
I'm letting him use some
of that fancy hair goo

00:41.875 --> 00:44.345
that I save for
special occasions.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.981
That's called shampoo, Dan.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.318
Oh, DJ's first date.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.519
I can't believe it.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.686
I remember my first date.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.722
I was a freshman in high school.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.624
Marshall Gordon.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.891
That wasn't his first name.

00:57.925 --> 01:00.961
That was his job.

01:00.994 --> 01:04.165
He got kicked off the
force 'cause of you.

01:04.198 --> 01:08.502
JACKIE: Well, well,
well, looky here!

01:08.536 --> 01:11.505
That suit looks great!

01:11.539 --> 01:13.040
The organ grinder was right.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.610
How you feel, son?

01:16.644 --> 01:18.512
I'm kind of scared.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.713
Talk to him, Dan.

01:19.747 --> 01:23.684
There's an extra pork
chop in it for you.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.653
I don't know what to tell him.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.155
Well, just tell him
the same thing your dad

01:27.188 --> 01:29.990
told you on your first date.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.360
Hm.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.596
Son, if you think of it,
bring back a pack of Camels.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.500
[knock]

01:43.537 --> 01:44.405
[sigh]

01:46.974 --> 01:48.309
Well, it's pretty
much what I expected.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.314
Hi, I'm DJ's mom.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.215
I'm Lisa.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.716
Nice to meet you.

01:55.749 --> 01:56.984
Hey, doofus.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.286
Hey.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.121
We have lots of little funny
nicknames for each other.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.556
What do you call her?

02:02.590 --> 02:04.057
Uh, Lisa?

02:06.794 --> 02:09.930
Oh, here, it's a flower.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.633
Look at my dress.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.269
Are there any colors
that come close to going

02:15.303 --> 02:16.204
with a blue flower?

02:19.573 --> 02:20.441
Sorry.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.009
"Sorry" doesn't cut it.

02:22.042 --> 02:25.846
You get your money back
for it and give that to me.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.316
All right, well, let me take
a picture of you two in case

02:28.349 --> 02:31.552
DJ don't make it back.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.453
Wait.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.121
I'm you're date, DJ.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.524
I'm not just some kid
you're hanging out with.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.559
Put your arm around me.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.928
OK, go ahead, Mrs. Conner.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.696
OK, smile real big, DJ.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.831
I want to see them teeth.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.766
After all, this is the
first picture I've taken

02:45.799 --> 02:48.802
of you since they came in.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.870
OK.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.472
Now who's driving us?

02:51.505 --> 02:52.940
- David is.
- You David?

02:52.973 --> 02:53.841
No, ma'am.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.777
I mean, no.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.746
(SHOUTING) David!

02:58.779 --> 03:00.914
Well, Lisa, while we're
waiting for David to come in,

03:00.948 --> 03:03.651
why don't you sit down, tell
us a little bit about yourself?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.486
Well, I'm in all
the honor classes,

03:05.519 --> 03:08.155
and I'm president of
the student council.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.558
I also played the clarinet,
and I was just elected

03:10.591 --> 03:12.926
to be in the all-county band.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.030
Well, that is very impressive.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.667
Uh, DJ can make a spoon
stick to his forehead.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.773
Hey, you guys ready?

03:25.806 --> 03:28.942
Nice meeting Everybody.

03:28.976 --> 03:32.112
Man, who gets drunk and
cuts this family's hair?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.988
Don't just stand there.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.424
Open the door for
me like a gentleman.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.298
Can you sit up in
the front seat with me?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.435
Dad, I'm still kind of scared.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.203
LISA: Train's
pulling out, doofus!

03:56.236 --> 03:59.139
Coming!

03:59.172 --> 04:03.043
What was that?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.545
I don't know.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.414
But the dark prince
takes many forms.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.785
I like her.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.187
[theme music]

04:56.530 --> 04:58.432
[cackles]

04:59.533 --> 05:01.402
[music playing]

05:04.972 --> 05:07.074
So, did you ask
your folks yet?

05:07.107 --> 05:08.376
Uh, no.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.211
Yes, he may marry you.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.581
My family's going camping
at the lake this weekend,

05:13.614 --> 05:15.649
and I want DJ to come with us.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.150
My mom said it was OK.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.319
Well, then it's OK with us.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.422
Roseanne, isn't
there someone else you

05:21.455 --> 05:23.557
should be asking about this?

05:23.591 --> 05:24.458
Oh, yeah.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.193
So you want to go, right?

05:26.226 --> 05:27.194
Yeah!

05:27.227 --> 05:28.362
Cool.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.297
Hey, if you start sitting
around the campfire

05:30.330 --> 05:32.800
and telling scary
stories, change our names.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.939
Roseanne, I'm
serious about this.

05:38.972 --> 05:39.840
Oh!

05:39.873 --> 05:40.808
Yeah, all right.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.376
Yeah, we'll talk.

05:42.410 --> 05:46.447
Uh, see, you don't want to take
all the fight out of your guy.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.216
You want him to still be
able to bark at strangers.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.117
Gotcha.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.520
Come on, D. Let's go for a walk.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.754
OK, L.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.588
Don't do that.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.464
There is no way
I'm letting my son

06:03.497 --> 06:05.132
go to the lake with that girl.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.400
Why not?

06:06.434 --> 06:07.935
Because she pushes him around.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.369
She's a bully.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.972
Oh, what, so now
pushing people around

06:12.005 --> 06:14.975
makes you a bully?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.644
Roseanne, if this
was one of our girls

06:16.677 --> 06:18.412
and some boy was
treating her this bad,

06:18.446 --> 06:19.847
you'd tear that guy apart.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.282
This is completely
different, Dan.

06:22.315 --> 06:25.018
A boy starts life way
up here on a throne,

06:25.052 --> 06:26.454
and a girl is down here.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.888
So if a boy's pushing
a girl around,

06:27.921 --> 06:29.423
he's trying to keep her down.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.691
But if a girl's
pushing a boy around,

06:30.724 --> 06:31.992
she's trying to elevate herself.

06:32.025 --> 06:32.860
Can't you see that?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.631
Boys bullying girls
is a step backwards.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.600
But girls bullying boys?

06:39.633 --> 06:40.501
Now, that's the future.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.334
[door slams]

06:42.703 --> 06:45.038
Hey, did you guys decide
about the lake thing?

06:45.072 --> 06:48.476
'Cause Lisa wants to know now.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.543
Well, I'm against it.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.778
Your mom's for it--
- Oh, boy.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.012
I'm gonna go get
my sleeping bag.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.751
[music playing]

07:00.220 --> 07:01.689
Hm.

07:01.722 --> 07:05.125
So that's what a
wombat looks like.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.227
I really don't see
why we have to be here.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.930
Because you need help
with your anger, Fred.

07:09.963 --> 07:15.035
Anyone who's had as much
therapy as I have knows that.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.269
What anger?

07:16.303 --> 07:18.739
The anger that you take
and mash down and mash down

07:18.772 --> 07:22.409
until it's all buried deep
down inside you, just all--

07:22.442 --> 07:23.243
mashed!

07:26.914 --> 07:28.549
I don't have any mashed anger.

07:28.582 --> 07:33.086
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho-kay.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.088
DR. WHITMAN: Well, I'm
sure sorry about that.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.790
But hey, there are plenty
of fish in the sea, huh?

07:39.893 --> 07:40.694
Bye-bye.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.799
Uh, Jackie and Fred?
- That's us.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.300
All right, come on in.
I'm Dr. Whitman.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.201
FRED: Hi.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.469
Well, that's silly.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.938
Obviously I'm Dr. Whitman.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.906
I'm the only one here, and
the sign says "Dr. Whitman,"

07:52.940 --> 07:54.074
so that's me!

07:54.107 --> 07:55.676
[nervous chuckling]

07:55.709 --> 07:57.110
Come on in.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.445
All right.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.346
Sit down.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.582
OK.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.750
Can I get you
something to drink?

08:02.783 --> 08:03.884
You thirsty?
- Uh, no.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.952
Are you cold?
Are you warm?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.119
I could open a window.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.688
But that's right, I
can't open a window.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.189
In my old office, I
could open a window.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.858
But this office, I
can't open the window.

08:10.891 --> 08:11.892
The window doesn't open at all.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.826
It's just-- I used to--

08:12.860 --> 08:13.694
I just moved.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.962
This is new.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.429
So that's why I'm still
saying I could open a window.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.031
But I can't, so.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.368
Listen to me, babbling
on and on and on.

08:21.401 --> 08:25.806
Well, I guess if you get
warm, I could break a window.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.474
Oh, I'm just kidding
about breaking a window.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.744
Anyhoo, if it's OK
with you, I would

08:30.778 --> 08:31.812
like to record the session.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.713
Oh, yeah, that's right.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.414
OK, great.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.049
Kind of like to play the
tapes for my friends.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.321
Just kidding.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.322
Kidding again.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.456
Okey-dokey.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.492
Why don't we get
started with each

08:45.525 --> 08:47.895
of you stating what you think
the problems with the marriage

08:47.928 --> 08:49.162
are.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.966
Um, Fred?

08:53.000 --> 08:53.901
I don't know what to say.

08:53.934 --> 08:54.802
Uh-huh.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.503
Well, see, that's, uh--

08:56.536 --> 08:58.706
think I discussed that
with you over the phone.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.476
Put down your shield, Fred.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.246
We are your friends.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.748
Did that sound hostile at all?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.416
No, I thought that
was very well said.

09:09.449 --> 09:12.285
OK, because sometimes I could
get started, and then whooo!

09:12.319 --> 09:17.457
[laughs] All right,
back to you, Fred.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.226
Well, I guess
apparently Jackie

09:19.259 --> 09:22.029
and I could have some kind
of communication problem.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.096
DR. WHITMAN: OK.

09:23.130 --> 09:23.964
All right.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.532
Anything else?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.668
Nope.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.370
Uh-- [splutters]

09:30.403 --> 09:31.739
Uh-huh.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.307
Well, I'm not going to need two
tapes on you, am I, slugger?

09:37.244 --> 09:39.346
OK, Jackie, what do you
think the problems are?

09:39.379 --> 09:40.480
Uh, not much.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.283
I would have to say,
I guess, that it does

09:43.316 --> 09:45.085
bother me a little
bit that Fred always

09:45.118 --> 09:48.088
likes things to be the same.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.489
Good, good.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.858
OK, Fred, would you like to--

09:50.891 --> 09:52.592
JACKIE: But it's all things,
all the time, always the same,

09:52.626 --> 09:53.727
always.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.328
You know, everything we
do, everything we eat,

09:55.362 --> 09:57.064
every TV show that we
watch has to be the same.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.298
No change.
No.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.432
Can't be variety.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.703
Has to be same, same,
same, same, same, same.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.238
Till you just want to strap
him on the back of the car

10:05.272 --> 10:06.807
and drag him around for
a little bit, you know?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.175
Because at least that
would be different.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.342
That would be something new.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.979
But what really bothers
me is this man's--

10:12.012 --> 10:16.650
this-- this Fred's calm, polite,
"I'm not a bit angry, I'm just

10:16.684 --> 10:18.618
sitting here on the couch
with my legs crossed wearing

10:18.652 --> 10:21.722
this shirt" crap, when
anybody can see that inside

10:21.755 --> 10:22.856
the man is seething with rage!

10:30.197 --> 10:32.766
Fred?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.803
Well, gee, I don't know.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.940
I-- you think there's something
wrong with this shirt?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.274
Oh.
Oh, my.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.943
JACKIE: What?
- Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.377
JACKIE: What?
You think he's hopeless, Doctor?

10:44.411 --> 10:47.147
No, the tape wasn't
recording the entire time.

10:52.385 --> 10:56.123
Stupid, stupid--
oh, there we go.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.090
All right.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.660
Now, would you mind
starting again?

11:00.694 --> 11:01.962
Well, from--

11:01.995 --> 11:03.396
The beginning.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.798
Yeah, something
about Fred wanting

11:04.832 --> 11:06.333
things same, same, same?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.802
The rage?

11:08.836 --> 11:12.139
Something about dragging
me from the back of the car?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.708
Oh, oh, oh, Fred spoke.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.509
Or I think that was
you, Fred, wasn't it?

11:16.543 --> 11:17.878
Because I wouldn't
recognize his voice.

11:17.911 --> 11:18.779
DR. WHITMAN: OK.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.513
There we go, and we're back.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.315
(RAPIDLY) It's just
like, maybe in the morning,

11:22.349 --> 11:25.218
he could just say pass the--

11:25.252 --> 11:27.087
[music playing]

11:30.090 --> 11:31.591
So Fred just sat
there in the office

11:31.624 --> 11:34.694
like a deer caught
in the headlights.

11:34.728 --> 11:38.766
I love that look on a man.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.600
What are you two doing home
in the middle of the day?

11:40.633 --> 11:42.335
I just picked DJ
up at the bus depot.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.636
Why?

11:43.670 --> 11:45.172
Wasn't there enough drool
and [inaudible] around here

11:45.205 --> 11:46.807
to keep you happy?

11:46.840 --> 11:49.109
It seems him and Lisa
skipped school today

11:49.142 --> 11:50.944
and took the bus
to downtown Chicago

11:50.978 --> 11:53.446
and didn't have enough
money to get back.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.347
What?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.216
You went to Chicago?

11:56.249 --> 11:57.317
Yep.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.119
And the bus company let
them ride back free,

11:59.152 --> 12:00.788
then made them
wait at the station

12:00.821 --> 12:03.323
while they called me away from
work to come pick them up.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.624
Well, I didn't want to go.

12:04.657 --> 12:05.859
Lisa made me.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.895
What do you
mean, she made you?

12:07.928 --> 12:08.996
She made me!

12:09.029 --> 12:09.863
I mean, you see her.

12:09.897 --> 12:13.466
You know how she is!

12:13.500 --> 12:16.336
Well, you've seen me and
you know how I am, too.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.438
Now you go in there and
kiss that TV goodbye.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.211
Can't believe that kid.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.345
I gotta get back to work.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.514
Hey, hey, hey, I could
use a little help here.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.416
Oh, no.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.784
A man helping a woman out?

12:30.818 --> 12:32.920
That's a step backwards.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.654
But you cleaning
up your own mess?

12:34.687 --> 12:37.590
That's the future.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.092
[music playing]

12:40.093 --> 12:41.995
[music playing]

12:45.065 --> 12:46.566
All right, let's
get this over with.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.467
DJ?

12:47.500 --> 12:48.301
(CHEERFULLY) Hi, Mom!

12:50.904 --> 12:53.540
Son, I am going to
punish you so hard

12:53.573 --> 12:57.911
that they're going to throw
a benefit concert for you.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.246
What are you
going to do to me?

12:59.279 --> 13:00.647
Well, I don't
know that yet, but I

13:00.680 --> 13:02.715
do know it starts with this.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.417
Go to your room.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.552
For how long?

13:05.585 --> 13:06.386
Bring a shaver.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.159
So mad at him.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.660
Well, of course you are.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.661
DJ did something terrible.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.562
You have to punish him.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.097
Not him, idiot.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.731
Dan.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.900
I hate it when he's right.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.701
Now he's going to think
he can give his opinion

13:21.734 --> 13:25.305
over every little major thing.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.807
I can't believe that little
girl was manipulative enough

13:27.841 --> 13:30.010
to get DJ to go to Chicago.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.779
Man, she is a natural.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.849
She's obviously
been married before.

13:35.883 --> 13:39.552
Well, can't blame the
whole thing on her, Roseanne.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.922
I mean, did you ever think
that DJ might be mimicking

13:41.955 --> 13:43.323
what he sees around here?

13:43.356 --> 13:46.493
The way little Lisa bosses
DJ around is exactly the way

13:46.526 --> 13:47.995
that you boss Dan around.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.630
I don't boss Dan around.

13:50.663 --> 13:55.668
I am trying to put him in
touch with his submissive side.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.971
Roseanne, admit it.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.073
You're bossy.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.175
Bossy.

14:02.209 --> 14:07.414
Is a farmer who turns a pig
into a glazed ham bossy?

14:13.486 --> 14:16.356
I am not saying that you and
Dan don't respect each other.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.725
I am just saying that as
an objective third party,

14:18.758 --> 14:21.061
I see how it can appear.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.263
Well, DJ's smart enough
to know that things aren't

14:23.296 --> 14:24.631
always the way they look.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.134
He isn't stupid, Jackie.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.835
Even though he did wear
his shoes on the wrong feet

14:28.868 --> 14:29.669
for three years.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.306
What?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.875
Oh, I'm just waiting
to hear you say,

14:35.909 --> 14:37.110
"You might be right, Jackie."

14:39.947 --> 14:40.981
Yeah?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.482
I'm waiting for chocolate air.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.254
Where are you going?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.722
I'm going to go show
DJ what terrible things

14:49.756 --> 14:53.026
could happen to him in a
great big city like Chicago.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.995
Don't you think that you
and Dan should talk to him?

14:55.028 --> 14:55.895
Why?

14:55.929 --> 14:56.997
What do I need Dan for?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.832
Roseanne, have
you been listening?

14:59.866 --> 15:02.269
Well, I was listening,
but then I stopped talking,

15:02.302 --> 15:04.237
and it all got really boring.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.140
[music playing]

15:11.844 --> 15:12.712
Hey.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.680
Hi.

15:13.713 --> 15:14.614
What are you doing?

15:14.647 --> 15:16.216
Me and Andy are
going to the park.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.250
Oh.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.751
Do you mind delaying
the park a little?

15:18.785 --> 15:19.852
I'd like to talk.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.389
Oh, now you want to
talk, when it's free.

15:22.422 --> 15:26.093
When it's 90 bucks an hour,
you're a block of wood.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.062
Well, I wanted to talk
about our therapy session.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.099
See, after the ringing
in my ears stopped,

15:32.132 --> 15:35.635
I thought that you
probably had a point.

15:35.668 --> 15:36.536
Really?

15:36.569 --> 15:37.537
Yeah.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.372
Maybe I am angry.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.673
I mean, I was
really hurt that you

15:40.707 --> 15:42.309
went out with this Pete guy.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.011
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.813
I got to pick up more
salt for that wound.

15:46.846 --> 15:50.283
Jackie, please, don't
get defensive on me.

15:50.317 --> 15:56.589
I'm trying to say that I
was partly to blame for it.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.825
Obviously you weren't getting
what you needed at home.

15:58.858 --> 15:59.726
Oh.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.095
Well, yeah, that was part of it.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.997
And I realized
something else, too.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.765
What?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.067
We're very different people.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.169
See, that's what
I've been saying.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.604
I didn't realize it until
now, but we barely knew

16:11.638 --> 16:12.772
each other when we got married.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.673
I know.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.208
We only had a couple of dates.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.043
And the baby.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.813
I know it sounds
kind of boring, Jackie,

16:20.847 --> 16:22.982
but I'm a homebody.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.951
I really like just
having a beer,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.853
watching TV, and
then going to bed.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.055
And I need more than that.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.590
I need more excitement,
to live on the edge more.

16:30.623 --> 16:36.763
I need to let the gas go
below a quarter of a tank.

16:36.796 --> 16:40.667
And I am the kind of guy
that could never do that.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.269
I'm also the kind of guy
that's got to tell you,

16:42.302 --> 16:44.071
that is so bad for your car.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.441
I guess you didn't
realize you were getting

16:48.475 --> 16:49.809
somebody so upright, huh?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.811
Well, I guess you
didn't realize you were

16:51.844 --> 16:54.214
marrying somebody so neurotic.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.048
Guess not.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.222
Well, we've got
one thing in common.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.258
We both got married
too fast to people

17:05.292 --> 17:08.495
who aren't what we expected.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.930
Yeah.

17:10.963 --> 17:17.404
So, guess I'll
take him to the park.

17:17.437 --> 17:18.238
OK.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.913
You want to come?

17:26.946 --> 17:27.847
Yeah.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.383
OK.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.884
Hey, I've got a great idea.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.253
This time we'll do
something different.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.487
We'll go to a different park.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.388
I know it.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.489
It's got swings.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.626
Small bites at first, Fred.
Don't gobble.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.729
Small bites.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.132
[music playing]

17:53.140 --> 17:54.307
DJ, what are you doing?

17:54.341 --> 17:58.245
Getting a head start
on my punishment.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.914
Well, Dan, that explains
those mints on our pillow.

18:01.948 --> 18:05.084
Turn it off, son.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.719
We need to talk to you.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.155
It's about Lisa.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.389
Oh.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.358
Yeah, see, we think
we figured out why you

18:11.391 --> 18:13.493
picked her for your girlfriend.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.394
I didn't pick her.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.263
She picked me.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.730
What your mom
means is we know why

18:17.764 --> 18:19.132
you keep going out with her.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.202
'Cause she tells me to.

18:22.235 --> 18:26.139
Oh, I want to like this girl.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.640
Is something wrong?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.576
Yeah, there is.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.578
She doesn't treat
you very good, Deej.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.513
And we think you're OK
with that because you

18:33.546 --> 18:35.648
think that's the way
your mom treats me.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.583
But you've got it all wrong.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.817
Yeah.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.153
See, me and your dad, we
totally respect each other.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.755
We're exactly equal
in this house.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.690
And you know why?

18:43.723 --> 18:47.026
Because that's
the way I want it.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.729
(CHUCKLING) I mean,
sure, it may look like she

18:49.762 --> 18:51.063
runs things around here.

18:51.097 --> 18:54.301
But there's a million ways I
get my own way around here.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.134
Like what?

19:01.641 --> 19:02.909
Give him an example.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.614
Oh, OK.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.949
Last month, your mom wanted
to tune up the truck.

19:09.982 --> 19:14.221
But that's something I like
to do, so I said, no way!

19:14.254 --> 19:15.455
Yeah.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.491
And giving in feels so
good when you love someone.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.494
The point is, son, you can't
let yourself get pushed around.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.297
So I should only like
girls who are wimpy?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.266
No, exactly the opposite.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.034
You should like a girl
who's tough enough

19:28.067 --> 19:31.404
to know what she wants,
but yet soft enough

19:31.438 --> 19:32.605
to know how to get it.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.507
And she should
have a very wealthy

19:34.541 --> 19:36.008
father with an enlarged heart.

19:39.879 --> 19:44.884
See, Deej, a strong
woman is a joy forever.

19:49.789 --> 19:53.660
But you also have to
be a very strong man.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.695
OK, I think I got it.

19:55.728 --> 20:00.032
Yeah, well, you said the
same thing about long division.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.635
OK, I was going out with
Lisa because I thought the lady

20:02.669 --> 20:04.136
should boss the man around.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.137
But that's wrong.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.573
Nobody should boss
anybody around.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.840
Bingo!
You pass!

20:07.874 --> 20:09.041
We're proud of you.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.243
We sure are.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.044
Does that mean I get to
go to the lake with Lisa?

20:12.078 --> 20:14.714
No, that means
you're grounded.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.249
But your dad and
I are going to go,

20:16.283 --> 20:18.217
and we're going to
send you a postcard.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.987
I hate this!

20:21.020 --> 20:23.723
We make a heck of a couple.

20:23.756 --> 20:24.957
Yeah, skip it, Dan.

20:24.991 --> 20:25.792
The kid left the room.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.030
Hey, I heard you in
there talking about why

20:31.063 --> 20:32.465
you're going out with Lisa.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.700
So?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.234
So I thought you were going
out with her because she

20:35.268 --> 20:36.703
slips you the tongue.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.371
Yeah, but I'm not
gonna tell them that.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.783
Where's DJ?

20:50.817 --> 20:54.621
He's out back cleaning
dog doo off my shoes.

20:54.654 --> 20:59.191
Could have stepped around
it, but I wasn't in the mood.

20:59.225 --> 21:02.962
Listen, Lisa, I think
you're really mistreating DJ.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.898
Do you have any idea
of the amount of crap

21:05.932 --> 21:09.135
I gotta take at school
for being DJ's girlfriend?

21:13.573 --> 21:15.508
Then why don't you just
break up with him then?

21:15.542 --> 21:17.610
Because he does do
one thing very well,

21:17.644 --> 21:20.913
if you know what I mean.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.015
Oh, god.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.284
Hey, Deej, what do
you say we show David

21:25.318 --> 21:27.253
what makes me stick around?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.788
No, I don't want to see this.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.189
Oh, it's OK.

21:36.162 --> 21:40.400
God, I love this man!
