00:06.200 --> 00:08.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:34.200 --> 01:36.680
For many years, I lived off tutoring.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.240
The tutor is a key educational figure
in the life of every kid.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.560
This role has grown
in importance over time.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.120
DON'T CALL US
THREE DAYS BEFORE AN EXAM

01:46.200 --> 01:48.280
I had some illustrious examples.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.280
Sarah dreamed of being a teacher

01:50.360 --> 01:52.720
and never wavered from her ambition,

01:52.800 --> 01:56.320
however our opinions
about teachers evolved.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.800
When we were kids she said…

01:57.880 --> 01:59.040
I want to be a teacher.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.360
And we'd reply…

02:00.440 --> 02:03.680
Traitor! Are you siding with those
who take away our Game Boys?

02:03.760 --> 02:07.200
Do you know what happens
to those who collude with the enemy?

02:07.280 --> 02:08.640
A wooden box!

02:10.160 --> 02:11.600
In high school, she still said…

02:11.680 --> 02:13.640
-I wanna be a teacher!
-We'd ask her…

02:14.240 --> 02:16.800
Why? Look at Ms. Di Paolo!

02:16.880 --> 02:19.800
She stares into space all day.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.440
She cries in the bathroom
during every break.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.120
She's addicted to benzos.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.240
Chase happiness, Sarah!

02:29.320 --> 02:30.680
Don't join the queue

02:30.760 --> 02:34.200
of teachers being bullied
by assholes like us.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.960
As we reached maturity,

02:36.040 --> 02:39.680
we could finally look at teachers
with serene detachment

02:39.760 --> 02:43.280
after finally getting
the fuck out of high school.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.480
We eventually settled on…

02:49.560 --> 02:51.760
you need to study lots,
the public exams suck,

02:51.840 --> 02:54.800
but whatever floats your boat.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.240
Tutoring for her
was like training for the future.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.360
Alice tutored as well,

03:02.440 --> 03:04.560
and she was also devoted to the cause.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.880
She was studying math
and tutored to pay rent

03:06.960 --> 03:08.680
as she was from Biella, not Rome.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.560
She was very sought after

03:10.640 --> 03:13.200
because algebra and trigonometry for her

03:13.280 --> 03:15.200
were just fucking child's play.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.160
-What?
-"Fucking child's play"?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.760
Is it inappropriate?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.160
You shouldn't use those words
in the same sentence.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.520
You risk upsetting people
for no reason, come on!

03:25.600 --> 03:26.640
Fucking child's play…

03:26.720 --> 03:30.040
Fine, it was a piece of cake for her.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.080
The point is, they all had
virtuous reasons to be tutoring.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.400
So I was inspired and I decided
to give it a go too since I needed a job.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.600
But eventually,
I realized it was a fucking nightmare.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.720
Every time I say it,

03:43.800 --> 03:45.800
my armadillo-shaped conscience tells me…

03:45.880 --> 03:48.160
Working on a building site would be worse.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.240
Just saying.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.240
Yeah, no fucking shit.
There's always something worse.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.080
You don't tell a mom who lost her son…

03:55.160 --> 03:58.560
Come on, the Kennedys lost 40 of theirs!

03:58.640 --> 04:00.160
FUNERAL WHO?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.880
I had no specific knowledge.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.280
I didn't want to teach, I wasn't studying,

04:05.360 --> 04:08.240
I just spent interminable afternoons

04:08.320 --> 04:10.520
in the home of these baby humans

04:10.600 --> 04:12.760
to make sure they did their homework.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.480
Fuck it, I was
the low-cost tutoring option.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.520
SHITTY TUTORING

04:17.600 --> 04:18.880
<i>Everything is cheap</i>

04:18.960 --> 04:20.880
<i>because I don't get hung up on labels.</i>

04:20.960 --> 04:23.360
The subject has no qualifications
and guarantees no results.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.600
Please read the fine print carefully.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.640
Maybe that's why I remember it
as a hostile and badly-paid profession.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.240
Lizard Kid never understood a thing

04:32.320 --> 04:34.840
and stared at me with a face that said…

04:34.920 --> 04:38.520
You're no teacher.
You're a teacher cosplayer.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.000
I don't give a fuck about what you say.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
My mom pays anyway.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.720
A questionable statement,
since his mother,

04:44.800 --> 04:48.360
that bitch the Lizard Mom,
with her 2,000-square-foot condo,

04:48.440 --> 04:50.880
was such a tightwad.

04:50.960 --> 04:54.520
I need to pay you
for the last two lessons.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.840
The total is 39 euros and 75 cents.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.720
Have you got change?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.880
No, I don't. I can bring it next time.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.440
Well, then I'll pay you next Tuesday.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.440
So we don't get confused.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.280
That was still borderline acceptable,

05:12.360 --> 05:13.520
it was an even fight.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.640
Eventually, even if it was out of boredom,

05:16.720 --> 05:18.040
homework would get done.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.640
The real hell was going
to the home of the Mouse Sisters.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.080
They weren't actual sisters,
but their parents wanted to save money.

05:29.160 --> 05:33.800
The act of putting together two tweens
created a unique phenomenon,

05:33.880 --> 05:36.360
a 12-year-old two-faced mouse.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.080
I'm telling you, dealing with
two 12-year-olds on your own

05:42.160 --> 05:44.280
is an overwhelming experience.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.960
First, they would squeal all the time.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.520
I'd tell them to study
and they'd throw paper at me.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.800
-I'd get mad…
-For fuck's sake! That's enough!

05:56.320 --> 05:57.360
He said "fuck"!

06:00.520 --> 06:03.600
By the end of the year,
I still hadn't managed to teach them

06:03.680 --> 06:05.720
how to use the possessive S.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.760
And yet, in spite of this
deeply frustrating experience,

06:09.840 --> 06:11.520
every time Secco said…

06:11.600 --> 06:13.800
Why do you waste time with those kids?

06:13.880 --> 06:15.480
Play online poker!

06:16.000 --> 06:17.920
Secco's enunciation is terrible.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.440
I believe he said, "Play online poker."

06:22.520 --> 06:24.480
Which is how he earned money.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.000
I felt inspired by some
enlightened, Romantic pride,

06:28.080 --> 06:28.920
and said…

06:29.000 --> 06:32.640
No, my friend.
Even in this frustrating situation,

06:32.720 --> 06:35.560
I still create a bond with these kids

06:35.640 --> 06:39.000
which your gambling addiction
will never give you.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.840
Maybe my grammar lessons
didn't go down too well.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.880
But at least I will teach them
some of my morals.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.600
I am older than them,

06:53.680 --> 06:56.760
but I don't have the same
loser scent their parents do.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.800
I'm more like an older brother.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.960
And when I see their mistrust in me
crumbling away,

07:02.040 --> 07:05.320
all that's left is a mixture
of curiosity and admiration.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.600
The most gratifying thing,
which you will never experience,

07:09.680 --> 07:12.200
isn't teaching a kid
some boring grammar rules

07:12.280 --> 07:14.480
that they'll forget
two days after the exam.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.520
IF YOU LEAVE NOW,
YOUR PROGRESS WILL BE LOST

07:17.480 --> 07:20.960
No, it's knowing that
somehow you inspired them

07:21.040 --> 07:23.880
and your lessons
will stay with them forever.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.440
The bullshit I told myself!

07:28.520 --> 07:31.480
I never heard from the Mouse Sisters again
after the eighth grade.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.160
I even texted the mom,
"How did the exams go?"

07:35.960 --> 07:37.680
MOUSE MOM:
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER?

07:37.760 --> 07:38.920
She never replied.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.080
I felt dead inside, like in <i>The Others.</i>

07:41.160 --> 07:43.440
Maybe I taught those kids nothing

07:43.520 --> 07:46.040
because I was already dead
and they didn't see me.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.680
It was all in my head.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.600
I even looked up Lizard Kid
on Facebook, thinking…

07:51.680 --> 07:53.480
I gave him <i>La Haine</i> on DVD.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.160
I sowed good seeds.
Who knows what he blossomed into?

07:56.240 --> 07:58.200
Well, he turned into a Nazi.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.240
I could see this
as a cultural-educational debacle.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.680
And self-awareness is good,

08:06.760 --> 08:09.800
but with those shitty parents
and living in that shitty area,

08:09.880 --> 08:11.960
it was an unfair fight.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.360
Maybe I shouldn't be so hard on myself.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.000
You should have played online poker.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.480
I don't know how to play!

08:28.560 --> 08:31.440
I'd have ended up
gambling my grandma's house away.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.040
The choice was either that
or turning a kid into a Nazi.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.840
Life is a series of tough choices
and we all answer to our own conscience.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.240
Choices are cruel.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.120
The older your get, the fewer you have.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.480
It's the avocado rule,

08:58.560 --> 09:01.160
their number is inversely proportional
to their price.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.720
As the years go by,
every choice becomes heavier.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
WHAT COLOR IS THIS DRESS?

09:04.880 --> 09:07.520
Because it might be the last one.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.360
I was eating out with Secco,

09:09.440 --> 09:11.320
and I couldn't choose between a Margherita

09:11.400 --> 09:14.200
and a tasty-looking pizza
that I'd never tried.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.400
For brevity's sake,
we'll call it the Whatever.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.120
I can't pick, so I ask Secco.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.080
What do you want?

09:19.160 --> 09:20.520
-And he's like…
-Dunno.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.320
As if that choice was totally irrelevant.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.480
I envy him,
because he has such an indifference

09:26.560 --> 09:30.920
towards the future
and the consequences of his choices.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.920
He lives a carefree life
like babies or certain dog breeds

09:35.000 --> 09:38.360
that chase a ball
and end up falling from the sixth floor.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.160
But time is of the essence,

09:41.240 --> 09:45.000
and the Margherita vs. Whatever derby
is freaking me out.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.560
It's like choosing
between killing Mom or Dad.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.760
Free will is incredibly cruel.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.800
I'd like someone to decide for me

09:52.880 --> 09:54.600
so I can then blame them.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
But I have to choose.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.560
I can tell the waiter is pissed off.

09:59.480 --> 10:02.040
His eyes betray the pain of the evening

10:02.120 --> 10:05.000
where 400 other people
couldn't decide what to order,

10:05.080 --> 10:07.960
then ordered 40 things
and sent them all back.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.720
I'm just the latest
in this chain of assholes.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.080
I'd like to tell him…

10:12.160 --> 10:14.800
I know that by the time
you get off at 2:00 a.m.,

10:14.880 --> 10:16.960
your friends are sleeping or screwing

10:17.040 --> 10:19.120
and all you can do is score some coke

10:19.200 --> 10:21.920
and do lines with a colleague you hate.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.040
But this is it, if you want
a semblance of a social life.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.240
I understand it, but I can't decide.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.360
And yet I know
there are only two possible outcomes.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.480
A, I order a Margherita

10:32.560 --> 10:35.080
and Secco orders a Whatever and I try it.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.400
And it's delicious!

10:36.480 --> 10:39.080
It's the pizza
Jesus ordered for the Last Supper.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.960
But I can only get a bite
because it's not my pizza.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.600
I start obsessing on how I wasted my life
in fear of taking risks

10:45.680 --> 10:49.160
and I always chose to stick
to my muddy swamp routine,

10:49.240 --> 10:51.920
destroying all relationships around me.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.160
And I want to throw myself off a bridge.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.120
Or B,

10:57.200 --> 10:59.560
I take a chance and order a Whatever.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.640
And it's shit. I knew it was gonna be!

11:02.720 --> 11:05.920
As always, I'm bored and I let myself
be seduced by the unknown.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.480
People have been eating Margheritas
since Ancient Rome,

11:10.560 --> 11:14.720
and the Whatever has been invented
by the new owners of this shithole.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.760
There must be a reason.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.520
To cut to the chase, I order
a Margherita and I tell Secco…

11:20.600 --> 11:23.200
You order the Whatever so I can try it.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.440
I'm ordering the zucchini one
and then an ice cream.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.720
I had forgotten
Secco's other main characteristic,

11:29.800 --> 11:33.320
he's absolutely against
any level of compromise.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.800
Something else he shares
with those damn dogs

11:35.880 --> 11:38.680
that won't eat their kibble for a week,

11:38.760 --> 11:41.480
so you worry you might need
to take them to the vet.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.240
Then you give them wet food
and they stuff their face

11:44.320 --> 11:46.560
because they just prefer it

11:46.640 --> 11:49.600
and they refuse to eat your crappy kibble.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.520
There is a third option,

11:52.600 --> 11:56.560
i.e. I've eaten the same thing I eat
every single time I eat out,

11:56.640 --> 11:59.360
no shock endings,
and the world keeps moving

11:59.440 --> 12:02.440
with its usual, frustratingly slow pace.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.360
Everything's going well

12:25.440 --> 12:27.400
besides the fact that I smell of piss,

12:27.480 --> 12:29.560
we got a flat tire,
the train is in 40 minutes,

12:29.640 --> 12:31.160
and Secco isn't coming down.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.280
SECCO
FOR FUCK'S SAKE

12:32.360 --> 12:34.720
I can't stand him when he does this.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.960
I called him 20 minutes ago

12:37.040 --> 12:39.160
and told him to come down.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.840
I know, I lied. I lied through my teeth.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.160
Because I knew he'd take two hours.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.360
And yet he can neutralize
all my Jedi mind tricks.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.720
He has mastered
the dark secret of the Sith,

12:49.800 --> 12:52.760
and this makes him
the most powerful force in the galaxy.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.720
He doesn't give a flying fuck

12:54.800 --> 12:58.040
if people are waiting
or if we miss the train.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.160
Relax, we'll make it.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.080
If someone tells me to relax,
my veins start popping out.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.480
I can feel the heat rising,

13:05.560 --> 13:08.880
and Sarah says the one and only thing
that can make it worse.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.320
We have plenty of time.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.480
No, we do not!

13:11.560 --> 13:13.440
I never have plenty of time!

13:13.520 --> 13:15.320
I don't operate like other people!

13:15.400 --> 13:18.520
She looks at me as if I was deranged,

13:18.600 --> 13:21.680
so I explain how the theory
is based on my studies

13:21.760 --> 13:23.120
and not on sheer paranoia.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.280
Let's say the airport is an hour away

13:25.360 --> 13:28.720
and I need to be there by 10:00 a.m.
A normal person sets off at 9:00.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.400
An anxious person leaves at 8:30
in case something unexpected happens.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.680
Nine times out of ten,
he gets there too early

13:34.760 --> 13:36.840
because nothing unexpected ever happens.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.520
Or it wouldn't be unexpected,

13:38.600 --> 13:41.080
it would be "expected,"
without the prefix.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.160
But I need to leave by 6:00
at the latest, four hours before.

13:45.240 --> 13:48.440
Obviously, nothing will go wrong,
nothing will happen,

13:48.520 --> 13:51.720
and I'll get to the airport at 6:55,
three hours early.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.800
I'll get bored shitless and I'll obsess

13:53.880 --> 13:56.400
about how I could have used
those three hours.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.280
I'd start adding up the minutes

13:58.360 --> 14:01.000
that I wasted in my life by being early.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.520
If I add them up, I could have used them

14:03.600 --> 14:06.840
to take a medicine degree,
specialize as an obstetrician,

14:06.920 --> 14:10.240
and become the world authority
on breech births.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.920
And I don't give a fuck
about breech births,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.560
but it would have been better
than waiting in an airport

14:16.640 --> 14:18.280
for the check-in to open.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.200
But if once in my life,

14:20.280 --> 14:23.000
I try to behave like a normal person

14:23.080 --> 14:26.960
and set off just one hour before
to reach a place one hour away,

14:27.040 --> 14:30.240
you can bet anything you like

14:30.320 --> 14:33.920
there will be a series
of biblical catastrophes

14:34.000 --> 14:36.400
which will lead me to miss the flight.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.600
That also goes for trains,
weddings, funerals.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.880
Anything! It's a law of physics.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.680
You can't tell me
that we have "plenty of time."

14:46.760 --> 14:49.360
Sarah is speechless,
but there is no stopping me.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.240
Secco isn't here and I'm freaking out,

14:51.320 --> 14:54.480
so I tell her that this phenomenon
has an actual name…

14:54.560 --> 14:57.480
The curse of Carmen the Gypsy.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.480
<i>Gypsy.</i>

15:00.160 --> 15:03.440
The curse originated when I was six
and I told a girl named Carmen

15:03.520 --> 15:04.720
whom I really liked…

15:04.800 --> 15:06.080
There's plenty of time,

15:06.160 --> 15:08.400
we can finish the game
before classes start.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.400
She trusted me
because I was a trustworthy kid.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.920
I was like a pheasant.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.720
Pheasants seem so calm,
like they'd never peck you.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.720
And they don't,
but they're stupid animals.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.760
Obviously, we were late back to class

15:21.840 --> 15:24.600
and we got yelled at
by our teacher, Ms. Gianna.

15:24.680 --> 15:28.360
I don't recall what she said,
but how do you threaten a six-year-old?

15:28.440 --> 15:29.320
Maybe you say…

15:29.400 --> 15:31.080
I'll draw a cross on your door

15:31.160 --> 15:32.920
so Santa won't bring you presents

15:33.000 --> 15:35.440
and Herod will kill your firstborn.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.400
But I do remember that Carmen looked at me

15:39.480 --> 15:42.280
and she said only one word, which was…

15:42.360 --> 15:44.240
<i>Limortaccitua!</i>

15:46.080 --> 15:49.520
I thought she didn't mean it,
but Corrado Persichetti said…

15:49.600 --> 15:51.120
She cursed you.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.800
She's a Gypsy.
When she swears, she's casting a spell.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.400
My mom told me.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.600
I didn't believe it.
I didn't even know Carmen was a Gypsy.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.360
And yet, since that day,

16:01.440 --> 16:04.680
when the teacher yelled
at Carmen the Gypsy because of me,

16:04.760 --> 16:07.480
I have to set off three hours early
to get anywhere.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.520
Take from that what you will.

16:10.040 --> 16:13.080
At the end of this tale
of fear and retribution, Secco shows up.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.560
He is clearly aware
he has put the whole mission at risk.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.680
And so he says…

16:17.760 --> 16:19.120
Wanna get an ice cream?

16:20.160 --> 16:23.240
I refrain from choking him
only because I am as resilient

16:23.320 --> 16:26.000
as the maids in<i> A Handmaid's Tale.</i>

16:26.080 --> 16:29.560
We set off, but I'm sure
we'll never make it on the train,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.480
and I keep telling myself…

16:31.560 --> 16:32.840
Well, that's how it is.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.120
I say it 34 times.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.440
That's how it is.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.280
Enough! We're on the train now!

16:39.360 --> 16:41.800
How long will you keep going
with this bullshit?

16:41.880 --> 16:43.760
Sarah is right. I can't believe it.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.920
For the first time,
I have beaten Carmen's curse.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.480
I'm touched. I'm a hero.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.960
Maybe the three of us

16:50.040 --> 16:53.160
have joined our energies
and defeated the dark powers.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.800
Persichetti used to say
that Carmen would curse you,

16:57.880 --> 16:59.720
then that she'd steal children.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.120
Now he says she steals
council houses from real Italians

17:02.200 --> 17:03.560
even though she's more Italian than you.

17:03.640 --> 17:07.280
I suspect Persichetti
has always peddled bullshit.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.320
That could be.

17:09.400 --> 17:13.360
After all, there were other clues
pointing to the fact

17:13.440 --> 17:16.160
that our lives were founded
on rather shaky grounds.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.640
