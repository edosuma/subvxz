Previously on Faking It...

00:01.052 --> 00:01.907
Did you set me up?

00:01.908 --> 00:03.308
I thought I'd psyche you out a little.

00:03.309 --> 00:04.676
Maybe we just try being friends.

00:04.677 --> 00:06.611
Yeah, let's... Let's give that a shot.

00:06.612 --> 00:07.979
We have a thing, don't we?

00:07.980 --> 00:10.048
Well, no, we can't
have a thing, not now.

00:10.049 --> 00:11.383
I can earn your trust back.

00:11.384 --> 00:13.051
To do that, I think I should move out.

00:13.052 --> 00:15.153
I'll let you crash on my couch.

00:15.154 --> 00:16.355

dad transferred here?

00:39.746 --> 00:41.513

down memory lane has been,

01:00.013 --> 01:01.679
I have to go,

01:01.680 --> 01:06.484

auditions for our band.

01:06.485 --> 01:07.852

01:11.123 --> 01:13.291
Amy and I will spend time catching up.

01:16.796 --> 01:18.463
I guess I can be a little late.

01:18.464 --> 01:19.931
Karma, no, don't worry.

01:19.932 --> 01:21.766

so you will have plenty

01:21.767 --> 01:23.301

Well, none of these people are right.

And I'm in a hurry.

02:55.641 --> 02:56.808

03:01.347 --> 03:03.214

were The Three Amigas.

Oh no, señor.

all nice and sweet.</i>

03:15.328 --> 03:16.528
- Ow!
- Oops.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.595
Sorry, Karm.

03:17.596 --> 03:19.164
<i>To make matters worse,</i>

03:19.165 --> 03:21.333
<i>Sabrina and Amy were in a bunk together,</i>

03:21.334 --> 03:22.834
<i>and my bunk was across camp.</i>

03:22.835 --> 03:24.436
Nighty night, Karm.

03:24.437 --> 03:28.006

trying to push me out.</i>

03:28.007 --> 03:29.541

<i>so each night, I'd
sneak into their bunk,</i>

03:31.811 --> 03:35.146
<i>until someone tipped off night duty.</i>

03:35.147 --> 03:36.147
Let me guess.

03:36.148 --> 03:37.916
You think it was Sabrina.

03:37.917 --> 03:42.087
Well, after that, she had
Amy to herself every night.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.588
Karma, I know that 12-year-old you

03:43.589 --> 03:45.023
thinks Sabrina was out to get you,

03:45.024 --> 03:46.591

03:46.592 --> 03:48.927

Amy had a new friend?

03:48.928 --> 03:50.895
Okay, I know sometimes I can be

03:50.896 --> 03:52.130

03:52.131 --> 03:53.765
but that's not what is happening here.

03:53.766 --> 03:56.067
Sabrina is not who she
portrays herself to be.

03:56.068 --> 03:57.535
She is bad news.

03:57.536 --> 04:00.672
Karma, even if your memories
of Sabrina are correct...

04:00.673 --> 04:02.540
- Which they are.
- Uh-huh.

04:02.541 --> 04:04.976
Are you the same person you were then?

04:05.924 --> 04:07.312
No.

04:07.313 --> 04:10.452
Well, maybe Sabrina isn't either.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.284
You're right.

04:13.285 --> 04:14.419
I should give her a second chance.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.221
Way to take my advice.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.488
Okay, next!

04:18.656 --> 04:20.158
You guys are the Double Puntendres?

04:20.159 --> 04:21.392
I thought you were Zhe and Zhim.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.628
We're just workshopping names.

04:23.629 --> 04:24.996
Um, you're here to audition?

04:24.997 --> 04:26.231
I am.

04:26.232 --> 04:27.399
Apparently paying gigs want bands,

04:27.400 --> 04:28.633
so I need to be in one.

04:28.634 --> 04:29.601
Pity!

04:29.602 --> 04:30.902
Unfortunately, we're looking

04:30.903 --> 04:31.936

04:31.937 --> 04:33.905

Noah's incredibly talented

04:41.213 --> 04:42.247

04:42.248 --> 04:43.348
He betrayed me,

04:43.349 --> 04:44.883
and people like that never change.

04:44.884 --> 04:48.853
But we just agreed that
Sabrina and I both changed.

04:48.854 --> 04:50.121
This is different.

04:50.122 --> 04:51.456
Never gonna happen.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.326
Bye.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.997
Remember when Jessica F
lost her canoe paddle

04:58.998 --> 05:00.665
and drifted into the lake?

05:00.666 --> 05:01.833
Do I!

05:01.834 --> 05:03.201
They found her, right?

05:03.202 --> 05:04.436
I'm pretty sure.

05:08.674 --> 05:10.041
Oh, by the way, meet Sabrina.

05:10.042 --> 05:12.577
She just moved here, and she's the best.

05:12.578 --> 05:13.812
I'm sorry to see you've fallen in

05:13.813 --> 05:15.113
with a such a bad crowd so soon.

05:15.114 --> 05:16.247
She does seem pretty sketchy,

05:16.248 --> 05:17.615
but I'll take my chances.

05:17.616 --> 05:19.217
Don't say I didn't warn you.

05:20.986 --> 05:23.855
Why did you let me blah
blah blah about Jessica F

05:23.856 --> 05:26.057
when we could have been
talking about Felix?

05:26.058 --> 05:27.092
He is super cute.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.359
Are you guys dating?

05:28.360 --> 05:30.361
Long story short, no, not dating.

05:30.362 --> 05:33.198
Oh, is there another guy in the picture?

05:33.199 --> 05:36.067
Nope, no guy,

05:36.068 --> 05:40.438
or girl, for that matter.

05:42.074 --> 05:43.274
Oh!

05:43.275 --> 05:44.909
You always talked about boys at camp,

05:44.910 --> 05:46.044
so I just assumed.

05:46.045 --> 05:47.545
Man, that was Republican of me.

05:47.546 --> 05:51.185
No, it's been a rather
recent development.

05:51.918 --> 05:52.984
How about you?

05:52.985 --> 05:54.219
I have a boyfriend.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.920
We're trying the long-distance thing.

What can I say?

05:56.956 --> 05:57.922
I'm a masochist.

Hey, hey, hey!

05:58.924 --> 05:59.824
I'm back!

05:59.825 --> 06:01.159

06:01.160 --> 06:02.193
but you're gonna have to repeat

we all hang out tonight?

that after everything

ask why you don't want

15:27.300 --> 15:29.968
to be in my band, and then you
tell me everything wrong,

15:29.969 --> 15:32.806
and then I beg you to
help me fix it, right?

15:32.807 --> 15:34.773

Why don't you want to be in my band?

15:36.743 --> 15:39.645
Well, man, I really
wasn't prepared for this,

15:39.646 --> 15:43.182
but since you asked, I guess I'd say,

15:43.183 --> 15:44.216
well, I hate the name.

15:44.217 --> 15:45.684
And if I'm being honest,

15:45.685 --> 15:48.053
your sound is a little

but being with you

16:01.601 --> 16:03.735

me behind Amy's back.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.508

16:35.835 --> 16:37.536
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:37.537 --> 16:39.404
<i>But then you started
showing up there too.</i>

16:39.405 --> 16:40.439
(SCREAMS)

16:40.440 --> 16:43.775
<i>I had to do something.</i>

16:43.776 --> 16:44.676
Ow!

16:44.677 --> 16:47.311
<i>So I called night duty,</i>

16:48.476 --> 16:52.603
<i>that way I could have Amy all to myself.</i>

16:56.523 --> 16:57.857
I knew it was you!

16:58.563 --> 17:00.492
I had to peel potatoes for a month!

17:00.493 --> 17:02.461
And I bet you're gonna tell Amy,

17:02.462 --> 17:03.929
try to turn her against me?

17:03.930 --> 17:04.863
No.

17:04.864 --> 17:06.746
I'm not 12 anymore, Sabrina.

17:06.747 --> 17:09.134
I can handle Amy having another friend,

17:09.135 --> 17:11.936
because I know no one will ever
have the connection we do.

17:13.205 --> 17:14.307
You're right.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.675
I'll never connect with
Amy the same way you do.

17:17.676 --> 17:20.011
But that doesn't mean you
two can't be friends.

17:20.881 --> 17:23.728
So why don't you and I call a truce,

17:24.417 --> 17:25.664
for Amy's sake?

17:26.810 --> 17:28.654
Truce.

17:35.727 --> 17:37.525
I'm pretty sure "go (BLEEP) yourself"

17:37.526 --> 17:39.794
means we're done talking.

17:39.795 --> 17:41.390
Listen, I want to apologize

17:41.391 --> 17:42.557
for real this time.

17:42.558 --> 17:43.925
I was just messing with you.

17:43.926 --> 17:45.727
I don't think you or your band

17:45.728 --> 17:47.028
are cliché and derivative at all.

17:47.029 --> 17:48.329
You're great.

17:48.899 --> 17:50.925
Then why do you keep messing with me?

17:51.434 --> 17:53.381
Because sometimes when I like someone,

17:54.104 --> 17:56.759
my attempts at flirting
can come off as, well,

17:57.340 --> 17:58.840
being a dick.

18:00.876 --> 18:02.475
Wait, you like me?

18:04.413 --> 18:06.881
You really need to work on your signals.

18:07.515 --> 18:09.020
How does this read to you?

18:09.920 --> 18:13.087
<i>♪ Ain't nothing but you and me ♪</i>

18:13.088 --> 18:15.890
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪</i>

18:15.891 --> 18:19.011
Wait, so are you in the band or not?

18:20.310 --> 18:22.130
I may need more convincing.

18:22.131 --> 18:25.667
<i>♪ Take, take, take ♪</i>

18:25.668 --> 18:28.291
<i>♪ We keep the lights out ♪</i>

18:29.805 --> 18:31.539
Three eights.

18:31.540 --> 18:32.507
Full house.

18:32.508 --> 18:33.908
Ugh!

18:33.909 --> 18:35.376
All right, all right.

18:35.377 --> 18:37.245
Looks like I'll be sleeping
in my car tonight,

18:37.246 --> 18:38.980
but the important thing
is that we all know

18:38.981 --> 18:40.415
that I am not New Lisbeth.

18:42.651 --> 18:43.685
(GROANS)

18:43.686 --> 18:45.620
Wait. Stop.

18:45.621 --> 18:47.388
You don't have to leave.

18:48.287 --> 18:49.958
Maybe I should, 'cause I'm pretty sure

18:49.959 --> 18:51.292
I'm gonna piss you off again soon.

18:51.293 --> 18:52.760
I'm pretty sure you will,

18:52.761 --> 18:54.529
but I won't kick you out because of it,

18:54.914 --> 18:59.340
because it's not horrible
having you around.

19:01.237 --> 19:02.875
Don't make a (BLEEP) thing out of it.

19:02.876 --> 19:03.838
(LAUGHS)

19:03.839 --> 19:05.931
Okay, if you insist.

19:07.014 --> 19:11.515
But you should know
that tonight was fun.

19:13.949 --> 19:15.583
Sorry tonight was crazy.

19:15.584 --> 19:17.352
I'm cool with crazy.

19:17.353 --> 19:19.988
But there is something that I
wanted to talk to you about,

19:19.989 --> 19:21.322
if that's okay with you.

19:21.323 --> 19:23.328
You can talk to me about anything.

19:26.662 --> 19:28.963
Earlier when you said
that you liked girls,

19:28.964 --> 19:30.509
it hit me.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.467
I've been having these dreams lately,

19:32.468 --> 19:35.370
and I've always thought
that I was straight,

19:35.371 --> 19:38.553
but now I'm starting to
think that maybe I'm not.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.624
What about your boyfriend?

19:43.754 --> 19:45.385
Made him up.

19:45.915 --> 19:48.850
Typical questioning girl cliché, right?

19:50.653 --> 19:51.953
Wow.

19:51.954 --> 19:55.990
Thank you, for trusting
me enough to tell me.

19:55.991 --> 19:59.127
I know how scary it is to open up.

19:59.565 --> 20:00.628
I would appreciate it if you didn't

20:00.629 --> 20:03.498
tell anyone while I still
try to figure things out.

20:03.499 --> 20:05.667
I know you and Karma tell
each other everything.

20:05.668 --> 20:07.979
No, no, I won't tell Karma.

20:08.405 --> 20:09.724
Or anyone.

20:10.307 --> 20:12.539
This is between you and me.

20:13.441 --> 20:14.873
I'm here for you.

20:16.112 --> 20:17.545
I knew you would be.

20:17.546 --> 20:20.581
