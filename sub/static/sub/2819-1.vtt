Let's go, muscles.

02:14.432 --> 02:16.815
- Hey! Where do you think you're going?! Huh?
- Ah!

02:16.816 --> 02:18.548
- Go! Go!
- Open this door, woman! So help me God!

02:18.549 --> 02:21.598
Open the bloody door!

02:23.750 --> 02:26.232
Go, mom! Drive!

02:48.331 --> 02:50.615
There'll be no green bottles

02:50.616 --> 02:52.647
Standing on the wall

02:54.016 --> 02:56.016
10 blue bottles

02:56.017 --> 02:57.615
Standing on the wall...

03:46.067 --> 03:48.931
Ah, look at that.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.448
Oi, Jimmy!

04:00.449 --> 04:03.065
Come back here.
Goofy, get back here!

04:04.466 --> 04:07.031
Can you go get your
brother, please?

04:10.298 --> 04:12.716
Nuh-uh. No way, kiddo.

04:12.717 --> 04:16.363
I've got a job interview in Albany
and it's still a day's drive away.

04:16.365 --> 04:18.363
Albany's gonna suck.

04:18.365 --> 04:20.348
And it's not going to
have waves like that.

04:20.349 --> 04:22.231
You could find a job here easy.

04:22.232 --> 04:25.081
Andrew, I'm not going
to ask you again.

04:33.632 --> 04:36.966
Come on, it's a sign.

04:36.967 --> 04:39.215
We'll fit right in.

04:39.216 --> 04:41.549
I promise.

04:44.116 --> 04:46.632
<i>Aww!</i>

04:46.633 --> 04:50.531
- <i>Big boy, let's go! Hit him!</i>
- Say it again, I dare you!

04:50.532 --> 04:53.849
I'm all ears, mate. Got
anything else you want to add?

04:53.850 --> 04:56.365
Come on, Lincoln!

04:56.366 --> 04:59.049
Nah, I didn't think so.

04:59.050 --> 05:02.098
Go on then, piss off back to Sydney

05:02.099 --> 05:03.631
<i>dickhead.</i>

05:05.915 --> 05:08.781
Awww!

05:08.782 --> 05:10.966
<i>Boys, break it up!</i>

05:10.967 --> 05:13.481
You lads break it up!

05:13.482 --> 05:16.248
Get off of him!

05:16.249 --> 05:19.214
God! Nothin' but trouble, you lot.

05:46.198 --> 05:48.032
I'll be back in an hour.

05:48.033 --> 05:51.432
Don't even think about
going anywhere.

05:51.433 --> 05:54.031
We'll talk about this then.

06:01.265 --> 06:03.198
Feel like a quick wave?

06:08.549 --> 06:11.332
<i>Deep down in Louisiana
close to New Orleans</i>

06:11.333 --> 06:14.381
<i>Way back up in the woods
among the Evergreens</i>

06:14.382 --> 06:17.148
<i>There stood a log cabin
made of earth and wood</i>

06:17.149 --> 06:18.315
<i>Where lived a country boy...</i>

06:18.316 --> 06:20.548
Hey there. I'm Gus.

06:20.549 --> 06:22.998
Jimmy Kelly.

06:23.699 --> 06:26.815
How's it goin', fellas?
<i>It's a bit nippy, eh?</i>

06:26.816 --> 06:29.281
Be warmer back on land, mate.

06:29.282 --> 06:31.564
<i>Go, Johnny, go go...</i>

06:31.565 --> 06:34.430
Guess I'll see you when I see you.

06:35.966 --> 06:38.398
Oi, wait your turn!

06:38.999 --> 06:41.631
<i>Johnny B. Goode...</i>

06:42.298 --> 06:45.431
<i>He used to carry his
guitar in a gunny sack</i>

06:45.432 --> 06:46.698
<i>Go sit beneath the tree...</i>

06:46.699 --> 06:48.265
Whoo!

06:48.266 --> 06:50.598
<i>Oh, the engineers would see
him sitting in the shade</i>

06:50.599 --> 06:54.032
<i>Strumming with the rhythm
that the drivers made</i>

06:54.033 --> 06:56.582
<i>People passing by,
they would stop and say</i>

06:56.583 --> 06:59.580
<i>"Oh my, that little country
boy could play..."</i>

08:26.014 --> 08:28.415
Wow.

08:28.416 --> 08:30.415
Hello, Mr. Fix-it.

08:30.416 --> 08:32.063
Oh, just basic patching, glassing.

08:32.065 --> 08:34.081
Caravans and canoes and stuff.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.563
<i>The nearest ding-fixer's in perth,</i>

08:35.565 --> 08:37.798
so I do most of the
locals' boards as well.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.115
Cool.

08:39.116 --> 08:42.899
- Really?
- Yeah. It's unreal.

08:42.900 --> 08:48.313
Sweet. All right, let's
take a look at ya.

08:50.981 --> 08:52.981
The nose section's pretty stuffed.

08:52.982 --> 08:55.815
I can try and bog her up, but I'm not
too sure how good she'll turn out.

08:55.816 --> 08:57.947
Why don't we just chop it off?

08:57.948 --> 09:00.114
He did.

09:02.315 --> 09:04.748
Yeah, genius.

09:04.749 --> 09:08.432
That's Dick Brewer. Bloke's a legend.
Probably has dozens of boards.

09:08.433 --> 09:11.248
- <i>So?</i>
- So we've only got the one.

09:11.249 --> 09:14.214
What if we stuff it up? I'm already
in a enough shit with mom.

09:14.215 --> 09:15.815
Couldn't make it any worse.

09:15.816 --> 09:20.448
Sorta makes sense. Less
surface area, less drag.

09:20.449 --> 09:22.764
<i>Your board, but.</i>

09:38.131 --> 09:39.580
Whoa!

09:42.515 --> 09:46.780
Pointing it the right way?
Ya little mullet.

09:56.698 --> 09:59.814
No, Jim, no, no, no,
no, not that one. Jim!

10:03.698 --> 10:05.280
Jimmy!

10:25.682 --> 10:30.497
Whoo!

10:32.098 --> 10:34.464
Whoo!

10:51.381 --> 10:54.031
And for the first time in
the history of the comp',

10:54.032 --> 10:56.098
we've scored ourselves a sponsor!

10:58.266 --> 11:00.732
Which means finally someone
else gets the privilege

11:00.733 --> 11:02.565
of putting on the keg.

11:02.566 --> 11:05.632
And that someone is
Mr. Ocean King himself,

11:05.633 --> 11:07.615
Gordon king!

11:07.616 --> 11:10.848
- Over to you, Gordo.
- All right.

11:10.849 --> 11:12.731
Thanks, Ron.

11:12.732 --> 11:16.231
Look, Ocean King are
stoked to be here,

11:16.232 --> 11:19.531
<i>supporting surfing at a grassroots
level in Western Australia.</i>

11:19.532 --> 11:21.581
By now you've all seen
candy wandering around.

11:21.582 --> 11:23.582
Where are you, darlin'?
Now come on, come over here.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.598
Right? Ha ha ha!

11:26.599 --> 11:28.198
Look at that, eh?

11:28.199 --> 11:30.065
If you're nice to her,
she might even give you

11:30.066 --> 11:32.232
a free stick of Ocean
King surfboard wax.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.348
I'll give her a stick!

11:34.349 --> 11:36.749
Yeah, right on, mate.
Back in your box.

11:36.750 --> 11:39.548
I can tell we all want to have a
beer, so let's get on with it.

11:39.549 --> 11:43.364
Okay, the winner of
the 1972 Ocean King

11:43.365 --> 11:44.914
Seacliffe Amateur Surf Comp'

11:44.915 --> 11:48.348
on what I am told is his
trademark red rocket,

11:48.349 --> 11:50.848
it's Jimmy Kelly!

11:50.849 --> 11:53.881
<i>Come up here, son! You got it!</i>

11:55.082 --> 11:56.815
Ah, shit!

11:56.816 --> 11:59.582
- Oh!
- Whoo!

11:59.583 --> 12:03.332
- Yeah!
- Speech! Speech!

12:03.333 --> 12:05.864
Well...

12:05.865 --> 12:08.682
- Let's get pissed!
- Yeah!

12:33.299 --> 12:35.531
<i>Ah, slow down a bit, mate.</i>

12:35.532 --> 12:37.864
Anyone'd think you got
somewhere else to go.

12:37.865 --> 12:39.648
Yeah, wind's going
off-shore, Percy.

12:39.649 --> 12:41.998
Be clean as a whistle
out there right now.

12:41.999 --> 12:44.499
I knock this one off, I'll get
half an hour in the water

12:44.500 --> 12:46.348
before the sharks
come out and eat me.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.081
Rather you than me, mate.

12:49.683 --> 12:52.665
Come on, Percy! Chop chop!

12:52.666 --> 12:56.163
You old bag of bones!
You're not done yet, mate.

12:57.364 --> 12:59.448
<i>Hang in there, Andy.</i>

12:59.449 --> 13:02.332
You won't have to carry the
old bugger for much longer.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.914
He's been carrying me
long enough, Stan.

13:03.915 --> 13:06.831
He probably deserves a bit of a
breather by now, don't you reckon?

13:06.832 --> 13:10.731
Aw, you're a soft touch. Plenty of time
for that when he's not on the clock.

13:10.732 --> 13:13.948
- Right, Percy?
- Oh, right as rain, Stan.

13:13.949 --> 13:17.315
About bloody time.

13:17.316 --> 13:19.549
You were supposed to
be here this morning!

13:19.550 --> 13:23.029
You blokes don't mind working
back to unload it, do you?

13:38.065 --> 13:40.515
<i>Hey, Jimmy!</i>

13:40.516 --> 13:42.348
Ah. Hey, ladies.

13:42.349 --> 13:44.598
- <i>How you doin'?</i>
- Nice car.

13:44.599 --> 13:47.197
Ah, thanks.

13:49.398 --> 13:51.931
Nice bike.

14:18.598 --> 14:20.015
<i>Hey, you.</i>

14:20.016 --> 14:23.581
Goofy, you smelly
old bastard, mate.

14:38.398 --> 14:40.398
Jesus, I thought my day sucked.

14:40.399 --> 14:43.048
I'm just finishing up.

14:43.049 --> 14:46.146
<i>So? How'd he go?</i>

14:52.566 --> 14:54.831
I thought we were going
to fix mom's car?

14:54.832 --> 14:57.065
Oh, shit, I totally forgot.

14:57.066 --> 14:59.314
- I'm meeting the boys for a drink.
- Which boys?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.547
I don't know, just the usual.

15:03.215 --> 15:04.864
How was your day?

15:04.865 --> 15:06.631
Long.

15:08.148 --> 15:10.315
You're really not going
to ask how it went.

15:10.316 --> 15:11.946
How what went?

15:13.565 --> 15:15.415
Dickhead!

15:15.416 --> 15:17.565
- Mom told you, didn't she?
- She couldn't help herself, mate.

15:17.566 --> 15:21.282
- Ahh! Jimmy Kelly!
- Whooo!

15:21.283 --> 15:23.232
<i>How good is that, mate?</i>

15:23.233 --> 15:25.564
Now you make it to the nationals, I'm
going to ask Stan for the day off.

15:25.565 --> 15:26.964
- How's that?
- Yeah, right.

15:26.965 --> 15:29.163
I'll believe that when I see it.

15:30.381 --> 15:33.614
I'll fix the car on the
weekend. I promise.

15:43.331 --> 15:45.147
Fuckin' hell.

15:55.897 --> 16:00.098
<i>Whoa, thought it was a nightmare</i>

16:00.099 --> 16:02.863
<i>Lo, it's all so true</i>

16:04.065 --> 16:07.081
<i>They told me, "don't
go walkin' slow</i>

16:07.082 --> 16:10.498
<i>The devil's on the loose"</i>

16:10.499 --> 16:13.647
<i>Better run through the jungle</i>

16:13.648 --> 16:17.298
<i>Better run through the jungle</i>

16:17.299 --> 16:20.881
<i>Better run through the jungle</i>

16:20.882 --> 16:23.913
<i>whoa, don't look back to see...</i>

16:41.131 --> 16:44.298
You boys know the fine for
pilfering another man's crayfish?

16:44.299 --> 16:46.064
<i>It's 10 bucks...</i>

16:46.065 --> 16:48.081
Per cray.

16:48.082 --> 16:49.896
<i>How many you got?</i>

16:54.998 --> 16:57.464
That's 20 bucks right there, mate.

16:59.781 --> 17:01.947
Honestly, we're really sorry, mate.

17:04.630 --> 17:07.896
Yeah, well, you will be if
the owner ever catches you.

17:10.898 --> 17:13.047
I can't believe you get
away with living like this.

17:13.048 --> 17:14.814
Who's gonna stop me?

17:14.815 --> 17:18.047
I don't know. Movin'
around all the time...

17:18.048 --> 17:20.931
Taking surf photographs,

17:20.932 --> 17:24.597
not knowing where you're gonna
be one day to the next?

17:24.598 --> 17:26.931
Doesn't seem like a job, right?

17:26.932 --> 17:29.681
It's not. It's not a job.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.248
Look, I surf and I
get to document it.

17:32.249 --> 17:34.531
If some idiot wants to
put diesel in my bus

17:34.532 --> 17:39.514
and buy me a plane ticket,
sweet, but it's not a job.

17:39.515 --> 17:41.746
Hey.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.648
Just don't tell anyone.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.514
G'day.

17:48.515 --> 17:50.414
- Hey.
- Where'd you come from?

17:50.415 --> 17:53.065
I was surfing that little
left-hander off the point.

17:53.066 --> 17:55.098
What's that called again?

17:55.099 --> 17:57.979
- Um, lefties.
- Of course.

18:06.631 --> 18:09.915
So let me guess. What,
Southern California, right?

18:09.916 --> 18:12.564
<i>Malibu?</i>

18:12.565 --> 18:16.232
Hawaii, west coast of Oahu.

18:16.233 --> 18:19.414
So what happened? You get sick
of warm water and perfect waves?

18:19.415 --> 18:22.098
- Something like that.
- <i>Huh.</i>

18:22.099 --> 18:24.996
How long you and your
boyfriend in town for?

18:26.564 --> 18:28.265
J.B.'s not my boyfriend.

18:28.266 --> 18:31.063
He's my dad's friend.

18:31.564 --> 18:34.981
Uh, dad wasn't too
stoked with the boys

18:34.982 --> 18:36.881
I was hanging out
with on the island,

18:36.882 --> 18:39.497
so he asked J.B. If I could
tag along for a few months.

18:39.498 --> 18:41.464
Figured it might straighten me out.

18:41.465 --> 18:44.929
What, he actually thought hanging
with J.B. Might straighten you out?

18:46.730 --> 18:50.096
- Should have seen the other boys.
- <i>Which other boys?</i>

18:51.898 --> 18:54.065
Jimmy Kelly.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.764
Hey, I'm Lani.

18:56.765 --> 18:59.015
- Yes, you are.
- Oh.

18:59.016 --> 19:01.114
Look, I don't know how long
you guys are around for,

19:01.115 --> 19:02.697
but if you ever want to check
out some of the local breaks,

19:02.698 --> 19:05.539
- I'd be happy to show youse around.
- Sounds good. Thanks.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.331
<i>And once you've done
the tourist trap,</i>

19:07.332 --> 19:09.198
I'll show you a few spots
even he doesn't know about.

19:09.199 --> 19:12.364
<i>- Is that right, superstar?</i>
- Yeah, well, I'd take you too, mate,

19:12.365 --> 19:13.948
but it's a bit heavy for beginners.

19:13.949 --> 19:16.064
Oh, turn it up, mate.

19:16.065 --> 19:19.082
There you go... it does work.

19:19.083 --> 19:22.414
Okay, uh, there you go.

19:22.415 --> 19:24.764
Thanks, man.

19:24.765 --> 19:27.764
- <i>These all yours?</i>
- Yeah.

19:27.765 --> 19:29.198
Shit. Where haven't you surfed?

19:29.199 --> 19:32.031
Grajagan's. It's a
real fast left-hander.

19:32.032 --> 19:34.447
Sucks real dry, bowls you real big.

19:34.448 --> 19:38.330
Yeah, only a handful
have ever surfed there.

19:38.331 --> 19:40.831
Yeah, some American cat...
He found it.

19:40.832 --> 19:42.664
Don't know how, 'cause
it's right there

19:42.665 --> 19:44.581
in the jungles of Indonesia.

19:44.582 --> 19:48.697
Filled with scorpions,
tigers, monkeys,

19:48.698 --> 19:50.664
<i>other crazy shit.</i>

19:50.665 --> 19:53.931
Wow, sounds like a total
mission just to get there.

19:53.932 --> 19:57.114
Yeah, well, the best
ones usually are, mate.

19:57.115 --> 19:59.215
That's the trip right there, man.

19:59.216 --> 20:03.314
If God surfed, that would
be his home break.

20:11.664 --> 20:15.680
That is exactly what
she was wearing, man.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.598
Yeah, from the sounds of her,
I'm surprised you even noticed.

20:17.599 --> 20:19.031
<i>Nice one, Gus.</i>

20:19.032 --> 20:20.698
<i>"With sculptured arms for paddling,</i>

20:20.699 --> 20:23.231
velcro neck and snap
fasteners for the cold,

20:23.232 --> 20:24.929
it's just for surfers."

20:26.581 --> 20:30.114
That's just for millionaire
surfers, more like it.

20:30.115 --> 20:32.548
Who's got 60 bucks lying around?

20:32.549 --> 20:35.981
We'll be dead and buried by the
time it makes it down here.

20:35.982 --> 20:37.879
Who cares?

20:39.981 --> 20:42.548
- Hey, mom?
- <i>I'm not here.</i>

20:42.549 --> 20:44.214
Got a sec?

20:50.115 --> 20:52.013
<i>Hey!</i>

20:54.048 --> 20:55.280
<i>Hey!</i>

20:55.281 --> 20:58.280
<i>Check it out! It's Rubberman!</i>

20:58.281 --> 20:59.864
Jeez, aren't you embarrassed?

20:59.865 --> 21:02.381
No. Why should I be?

21:02.382 --> 21:03.948
He was talking to your board, mate.

21:03.949 --> 21:06.630
Hey, boys.

21:06.631 --> 21:08.931
Great swell, boys.
You're not going in?

21:08.932 --> 21:10.998
Yeah, it's bloody cold, eh?

21:10.999 --> 21:13.614
- Yeah.
- Freezing, isn't it? Brrr!

21:13.615 --> 21:14.915
Yeah.

21:14.916 --> 21:17.612
Yeah.

21:43.214 --> 21:44.712
<i>Hey!</i>

21:47.348 --> 21:49.947
<i>Hey!</i>

21:49.948 --> 21:52.614
Fair go.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.947
Turn that thing off,
put your feet up, mom.

21:54.948 --> 21:56.281
Nearly done.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.347
"Mark 2." What do you think?

22:00.314 --> 22:03.581
I might struggle to
squeeze into it.

22:03.582 --> 22:06.814
Mick Harris saw Jimmy's one and
asked if we'd make one for his son.

22:06.815 --> 22:09.514
- Well, tell him to make his own wetsuit.
- Said he'd pay $15.

22:09.515 --> 22:11.214
- 15 bucks.
- Mm-hmm.

22:11.215 --> 22:14.580
Well, what are you
waiting for? Sew, woman!

22:16.148 --> 22:18.696
You in there, Jimbo?

22:20.048 --> 22:22.514
Jimmy, let's fix this car.

22:35.597 --> 22:37.697
What the hell?

22:44.280 --> 22:46.147
Haven't seen Jimmy, have you, Ron?

22:46.148 --> 22:48.081
Yeah, he was here a
couple hours ago.

22:48.082 --> 22:51.581
Said he was headed home.
Everything all right?

22:51.582 --> 22:53.914
Yeah.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.880
Yeah, sweet as.

24:08.131 --> 24:11.563
Ah, Jesus! Get back here!

24:11.564 --> 24:13.930
Stop! What are you doing?!

24:27.664 --> 24:30.446
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Andy.

24:31.614 --> 24:33.964
- Give me a hand, quick!
- Fuck!

24:36.365 --> 24:38.815
Thanks, man.

24:38.816 --> 24:40.948
You stay away from
my fuckin' brother.

24:40.949 --> 24:42.781
<i>Open this bloody door!</i>

24:42.782 --> 24:46.713
<i>Here! Police!</i>

24:52.681 --> 24:54.981
You got to take it all back,

24:54.982 --> 24:57.681
leave it outside the cop
shop with a little note

24:57.682 --> 24:59.514
saying who it belonged to.

24:59.515 --> 25:01.914
Yeah, right.

25:09.113 --> 25:12.345
Do it or don't bother coming back.

25:27.297 --> 25:30.997
Percy started working for my
father straight out of school,

25:30.998 --> 25:33.864
- and that was 1920...?
- Two.

25:33.865 --> 25:38.464
'22. Since then, well, he's become
part of the fabric of the place.

25:38.465 --> 25:42.915
<i>So in honor of 50 years of
hard work and dedication,</i>

25:42.916 --> 25:46.080
I'd like to present him with a
small token of our appreciation.

25:46.081 --> 25:49.231
- <i>Well done, Perce.</i>
- All right!

25:49.232 --> 25:52.796
<i>Speech! Give us a speech, Perce.</i>

25:55.313 --> 25:57.164
Thanks.

25:57.165 --> 26:00.714
- <i>Good on ya.</i>
- Yay! Love you, mate.

26:00.715 --> 26:03.197
Well, that's it, gentlemen.
Back to work. Thank you.

26:22.908 --> 26:26.431
<i>Mrs. Kelly, you look
absolutely fantastic.</i>

26:27.965 --> 26:29.447
<i>I wish my mom dressed like you.</i>

26:29.448 --> 26:32.564
<i>Oh, thanks. You want
some more salad?</i>

26:32.565 --> 26:33.597
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:33.598 --> 26:35.913
Good size flatty.

26:35.914 --> 26:39.530
I'm surprised you had time to go
fishing, considering your busy schedule.

26:39.531 --> 26:43.862
Had to go into town,
drop a bunch of stuff off.

26:46.431 --> 26:48.662
Caught 'em after that.

26:57.132 --> 26:58.598
- Howdy, Gus.
- Yeah, hi, Andy.

26:58.599 --> 27:00.531
- How you goin'?
- <i>Yeah, good.</i>

27:00.532 --> 27:01.698
What's the occasion?

27:01.699 --> 27:04.697
Mr. O'Reilly offered me
a promotion, didn't he?

27:04.698 --> 27:07.014
Hey, nice one, mate.

27:07.015 --> 27:08.980
- <i>That's unreal.</i>
- Yeah.

27:08.981 --> 27:11.947
More bucks, more hours...
The whole nine yards.

27:11.948 --> 27:15.247
Aw, that's fantastic, love.
When do you start?

27:15.248 --> 27:17.462
Well, I don't.

27:18.664 --> 27:22.546
I told him to shove it.

27:23.697 --> 27:26.147
It's all right. I've
got another plan.

27:26.148 --> 27:27.997
Is it legal?

27:27.998 --> 27:31.930
Yup. It's been staring us in
the face the whole time...

27:31.931 --> 27:34.329
The whole bloody time.

27:58.197 --> 28:02.296
<i>Rockin' and rollin',
you're still doing it now</i>

28:04.013 --> 28:08.096
<i>15 years today and
you remember how</i>

28:10.030 --> 28:13.880
<i>You're gonna hear it now
blastin' out your radio...</i>

28:16.981 --> 28:18.780
Look at this, will you?

28:18.781 --> 28:22.129
- It's a well-oiled machine.
- Hardly.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.163
Any luck?

28:29.164 --> 28:31.664
Not yet.

28:31.665 --> 28:33.780
Look on the bright side...

28:33.781 --> 28:35.913
At least we won't have to
buy surf gear ever again.

28:35.914 --> 28:37.097
Hmm!

28:44.280 --> 28:46.680
- <i>How you goin', Greg?</i>
- All right.

28:46.681 --> 28:49.297
- What do you reckon?
- Bit short, aren't they?

28:49.298 --> 28:52.430
That's the idea. That's what
they're doing back east.

28:52.431 --> 28:53.833
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she's a 6'8"...

28:53.834 --> 28:55.930
perfect for a bloke your size.

28:55.931 --> 28:59.414
- How much?
- Aw, 35.

28:59.415 --> 29:02.131
Call it an even 50
with the wetsuit.

29:02.132 --> 29:03.747
Look, mate, you don't like it,

29:03.748 --> 29:05.613
I'll give you your money
back, no questions asked.

29:05.614 --> 29:07.180
And you can keep the wettie.

29:07.181 --> 29:10.296
- You're cocky, aren't you?
- I've ridden it.

29:18.130 --> 29:20.197
All right, you're on.

29:20.198 --> 29:23.347
Good man. I'll give you a hand.

29:23.348 --> 29:27.064
Looks like we just beat the rush.

29:29.132 --> 29:31.129
- How are ya?
- Hey, how are ya?

29:38.447 --> 29:40.297
- He's a natural.
- Pleasure doing business.

29:40.298 --> 29:41.680
- Thanks.
- See ya.

29:41.681 --> 29:43.347
See ya.

29:43.348 --> 29:46.580
- See you later, boys.
- See ya, Jim.

29:46.581 --> 29:48.280
Man, you can talk.

29:48.281 --> 29:50.997
Lookin' good, Gus!

29:50.998 --> 29:52.347
Yeah.

29:56.080 --> 29:59.079
Be right out.

30:02.947 --> 30:04.480
Aloha.

30:04.481 --> 30:06.214
Oh, hey.

30:06.215 --> 30:08.097
How's it going?
You settling in okay?

30:08.098 --> 30:10.964
You know, just getting my bearings.

30:10.965 --> 30:12.464
What, all two streets?

30:14.947 --> 30:17.247
- You in the market for a new stick?
- Maybe.

30:17.248 --> 30:20.946
I really just came to see Jimmy's
set-up, see what all the hype's about.

30:20.947 --> 30:22.381
Jimmy's set-up? Is that right?

30:22.382 --> 30:25.447
C'mon, mate. I am head shaper.

30:25.448 --> 30:28.447
Well, you're the only
shaper, dickhead.

30:28.448 --> 30:31.696
I get him to put the bins out,
sweep up, that kind of thing.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.464
- Keeps him off the streets.
- Don't worry about him.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.264
- Reckons he taught me everything I know.
- I did, mate.

30:35.265 --> 30:37.997
Just not everything
I know. Big difference.

30:37.998 --> 30:40.697
Uh, we're going to check
out the canyons later.

30:40.698 --> 30:42.863
Think it'll handle the big stuff?

30:42.864 --> 30:44.947
Why don't you borrow
it and find out?

30:44.948 --> 30:47.247
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

30:47.248 --> 30:49.347
- Wouldn't feel comfortable.
- Why not?

30:49.348 --> 30:50.947
You know your way around a wave.

30:50.948 --> 30:52.980
Go for it. You're not
going to steal it.

30:52.981 --> 30:55.097
Promise you'll pick it
up whenever you need to?

30:55.098 --> 30:56.630
Scout's honor.

30:56.631 --> 30:59.330
I'll even swing by and
pick it up personally.

30:59.331 --> 31:00.997
- Ha.
- Okay.

31:00.998 --> 31:03.696
Well, I'll let you
know how it goes then.

31:03.697 --> 31:05.097
- Okay.
- Later.

31:05.098 --> 31:06.530
See ya.

31:13.447 --> 31:15.112
"Scout's honor"?

31:15.980 --> 31:17.481
What?

31:17.482 --> 31:19.481
No wonder you're single.

31:19.482 --> 31:22.147
You're kidding me, aren't you? She
couldn't take her eyes off me.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.147
Yeah, she was trying to work out

31:24.148 --> 31:26.513
if you were my brother or my dad.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.913
Go play, Jimbo.

31:29.914 --> 31:33.397
Oi! Drinks all around!

31:33.398 --> 31:35.131
Dream on, fellas.

31:35.132 --> 31:36.730
- Maybe next time.
- Aww!

31:36.731 --> 31:38.397
So what do you reckon?

31:38.398 --> 31:40.663
Sensible thing would be to put
it back in the mortgage, right?

31:40.664 --> 31:43.030
I don't know. I guess.

31:43.031 --> 31:45.263
Then next month we're
back to square one.

31:46.630 --> 31:48.764
<i>But if we bought, say, a planer,</i>

31:48.765 --> 31:50.714
<i>made some templates,</i>

31:50.715 --> 31:52.630
- a sander...
- Electric sander?

31:52.631 --> 31:54.297
Electric sander, a ton of resin...

31:54.298 --> 31:55.630
- Some fiberglass.
- What do you reckon?

31:55.631 --> 31:58.878
Eh? Why not, mate?

31:59.514 --> 32:02.364
Oh, ho ho! There's a rare sight.

32:02.365 --> 32:04.696
The Kelly gang out on the town.

32:04.697 --> 32:06.464
- Ha. Hi, Jim.
- Miller.

32:06.465 --> 32:09.097
Andrew. Buy you a beer?

32:09.098 --> 32:10.096
Naw, just leaving, actually.

32:10.097 --> 32:11.696
Oh, fuckin' turn it up.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.263
Ron, another beer for Andrew here.

32:14.264 --> 32:16.181
What's big brother letting
you drink these days, hmm?

32:16.182 --> 32:18.480
- Whatever I want.
- Oh, whatever he wants.

32:18.481 --> 32:19.579
Thanks, Ron.

32:19.580 --> 32:21.263
Aw, come on, hang around.

32:21.264 --> 32:22.997
We're short a few sheilas.

32:22.998 --> 32:25.397
You're the one wearing the tassels.

32:25.398 --> 32:27.596
Like 'em, do you?

32:27.597 --> 32:30.729
Made 'em for myself in prison.

32:30.730 --> 32:32.613
Well, the cut really suits you.

32:32.614 --> 32:34.080
It's very slimming.

32:34.081 --> 32:36.497
Is that right?

32:36.498 --> 32:38.964
Why don't I take it off and
give you a closer look?

32:38.965 --> 32:41.414
Calm down now, Miller. Take it
outside if you want to muck around.

32:41.415 --> 32:42.997
It's okay, Ron.

32:42.998 --> 32:44.797
Leave 'em to their little shindig.

32:46.448 --> 32:50.513
Round of shandies for the boys.

32:51.314 --> 32:53.845
Eh? Let's go, Jim.

33:07.997 --> 33:09.930
<i>Andrew, how much are we
talking about exactly?</i>

33:09.931 --> 33:13.280
I don't know. Five
grand, kick it off.

33:13.281 --> 33:16.713
5,000... dollars?

33:16.714 --> 33:18.563
Yeah, just for starters.

33:21.529 --> 33:24.663
Son, you're dreaming.

33:24.664 --> 33:29.180
I'm not going to lend $500
on a whim, let alone $5,000.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.397
And given the state of
your mom's mortgage,

33:31.398 --> 33:35.364
I don't think now's the right time to
be getting further into debt, do you?

33:35.365 --> 33:37.529
You just can't drift through life

33:37.530 --> 33:39.197
like it owes you a living, Andrew.

33:39.198 --> 33:40.813
It doesn't.

33:40.814 --> 33:43.947
My advice? Head over to the mill

33:43.948 --> 33:47.264
and ask Stan O'Reilly
for your old job back.

33:47.265 --> 33:49.495
At least it's real.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.563
<i>You're the only
supplier in the state,</i>

33:53.564 --> 33:55.797
<i>so I'm hardly going to
screw you over, am I?</i>

33:55.798 --> 33:58.313
<i>You'll have your money
by the end of the month.</i>

33:58.314 --> 34:00.863
Bob, I guarantee it, okay?

34:00.864 --> 34:04.596
I just need a few blanks on tick
to get me into the game, mate.

34:04.597 --> 34:07.796
I don't know. How's 20 sound?

34:07.797 --> 34:10.429
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:11.297 --> 34:13.246
Fantastic. All right.

34:13.248 --> 34:15.245
Great, see you then.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.246
20 blanks on credit?

34:18.248 --> 34:20.596
I must have sounded like I actually
knew what I was talking about.

34:20.597 --> 34:23.097
All those years of bullshitting
might finally be paying off.

34:23.098 --> 34:26.246
Come check this out.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.713
<i>What in Christ's name is this?</i>

34:35.714 --> 34:38.562
It's a knee-board for Gus.

34:39.614 --> 34:42.197
- Um, J.B.'s idea.
- You serious?

34:42.197 --> 34:44.513
It's an early Christmas present.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.014
You can't leave him
on the beach all day.

34:46.014 --> 34:48.547
The little bastard would
steal all my gear.

34:51.098 --> 34:54.963
We made something for you too.

34:58.947 --> 35:00.679
Whoo!

35:02.763 --> 35:04.862
Whoo!

35:09.146 --> 35:12.997
<i>Oh</i>

35:12.998 --> 35:16.279
<i>It's all about her</i>

35:17.380 --> 35:20.196
<i>Oh</i>

35:20.197 --> 35:24.413
<i>It's all about her</i>

35:24.414 --> 35:26.713
<i>I love her love, she's
been so kind to me</i>

35:26.714 --> 35:29.113
<i>She's opened up my eyes...</i>

35:29.114 --> 35:31.162
Whoo!

35:32.362 --> 35:34.063
<i>The whispers and the summer wine</i>

35:34.064 --> 35:37.229
<i>May have made me realize</i>

35:38.830 --> 35:42.097
<i>Whoo oooo</i>

35:42.098 --> 35:45.997
<i>It's not about her</i>

35:45.998 --> 35:49.997
<i>Ooo ooo ooo ooo</i>

35:49.998 --> 35:53.179
<i>It's all about her.</i>

35:57.297 --> 35:58.446
Hey!

35:58.447 --> 36:00.164
How's the new board,
huh? Rips, yeah?

36:00.165 --> 36:01.713
Oh, man, it's responsive.

36:01.714 --> 36:03.446
I can feel it in my
bum ankle already.

36:03.447 --> 36:05.496
Almost ate it a couple
of times out there.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.180
It'd do you good to get out of
control every now and then.

36:08.181 --> 36:10.164
Hey, did you see that?
Did you see that?

36:10.165 --> 36:11.796
Man, this thing is unbelievable.

36:11.797 --> 36:14.214
Man, honestly, it's the
best present ever. It is.

36:14.215 --> 36:16.563
- Yeah.
- You're making it look too easy!

36:16.564 --> 36:19.846
I think it's less about me
and more about the board.

36:19.847 --> 36:22.281
I'll have to make the next one
even more radical then, huh?

36:22.282 --> 36:23.946
- Steady on, tiger.
- Huh?

36:23.947 --> 36:25.946
That's awesome for
surfers that can rip.

36:25.947 --> 36:27.647
Don't forget about the
rest of the world too.

36:27.648 --> 36:29.797
- Bugger the rest of the world.
- No, you think about it.

36:29.798 --> 36:31.413
There's a whole bunch
of people out there

36:31.414 --> 36:33.346
waiting to surf better
because of our gear.

36:33.347 --> 36:36.696
We play our cards right, we could be
shaping a much bigger future here.

36:39.181 --> 36:41.863
Shaping a much bigger future?

36:41.864 --> 36:44.780
Yeah, it's a TV ad.

36:45.965 --> 36:50.263
You cannot beat the man by
becoming the man. Yeah?

36:50.264 --> 36:52.197
No, I'm just thinking big picture.

36:52.198 --> 36:53.930
What's wrong with that?

36:53.931 --> 36:55.930
All right, guys, good sesh.

36:55.931 --> 36:58.229
Catch you later.

37:02.163 --> 37:06.563
I'm just shaping surfboards,
brother. That's all I'm doing.

37:06.564 --> 37:08.630
Ha! Gussy!

37:15.429 --> 37:18.596
<i>Don't think I don't know
what I'm talking about</i>

37:18.597 --> 37:21.529
<i>I'm leaving you, baby,
without a doubt</i>

37:21.530 --> 37:24.180
<i>I don't need you no more</i>

37:24.181 --> 37:26.446
<i>Don't need you, baby...</i>

37:28.880 --> 37:31.413
<i>Got room for one more?</i>

37:31.414 --> 37:33.513
I brought tofu scrambles.

37:33.514 --> 37:35.013
<i>Love is all the same</i>

37:35.014 --> 37:38.396
<i>I don't need you no more</i>

37:38.397 --> 37:40.645
<i>Don't need you, baby</i>

37:42.246 --> 37:45.064
<i>You're biting off more
than you can chew</i>

37:45.065 --> 37:47.930
<i>Baby, I ain't ever
coming home to you</i>

37:47.931 --> 37:49.629
<i>I don't need you no more...</i>

37:50.831 --> 37:53.279
<i>Don't need you, baby</i>

37:55.312 --> 37:58.279
<i>Look so sweet, look so fine...</i>

37:58.280 --> 38:01.612
<i>Take your time, sweetheart!</i>

38:04.729 --> 38:06.263
Doesn't even look like me.

38:06.264 --> 38:08.480
Whoo! Yeah!

38:08.481 --> 38:11.279
So much more than just you, kid.

38:14.330 --> 38:18.546
<i>So you know everybody
that there is to know</i>

38:18.547 --> 38:20.730
<i>Puttin' on your charm
like a little show</i>

38:20.731 --> 38:23.131
<i>I don't need you no more</i>

38:23.132 --> 38:25.845
<i>Don't need you, baby...</i>

38:27.279 --> 38:30.046
- Whoo!
- Jimmy! That's you, brother!

38:30.047 --> 38:33.680
- Ho ho ho!
- <i>I don't need you no more</i>

38:33.681 --> 38:35.763
<i>Don't need you, baby</i>

38:35.764 --> 38:39.246
<i>I don't want you,
don't need you, baby</i>

38:39.247 --> 38:42.213
<i>Oh!
Don't need you, baby</i>

38:42.214 --> 38:43.779
<i>Goin' on too long</i>

38:43.780 --> 38:45.679
<i>Don't need you, baby</i>

38:45.680 --> 38:48.346
<i>Ahhhh!
Don't need you, baby</i>

38:48.347 --> 38:49.913
<i>I don't want you, baby</i>

38:49.914 --> 38:52.179
<i>Don't need you, baby</i>

38:52.180 --> 38:55.078
<i>Movin' on, don't need you, baby.</i>

39:01.679 --> 39:04.814
See, that is the trip right there.

39:07.147 --> 39:09.663
Probably surfs solo most days.

39:09.664 --> 39:12.030
<i>He's not battling for waves.</i>

39:12.031 --> 39:15.313
He's not proving himself
against anyone.

39:15.314 --> 39:17.830
<i>That's it right there... unreal.</i>

39:17.831 --> 39:20.696
You reckon? I'd get bored.

39:20.697 --> 39:23.129
How does he even
know how good he is?

39:23.130 --> 39:25.896
Who cares?

39:25.897 --> 39:29.279
Seriously, who cares? It's...

39:29.280 --> 39:32.145
I reckon the last thing
on his mind is competing.

39:32.146 --> 39:37.012
You know, hey, we're pounding up
and down the coast selling shit.

39:37.779 --> 39:40.679
He's out there.

39:42.579 --> 39:46.579
Look.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.429
Booah!

40:03.312 --> 40:06.779
<i>He's living the dream.
What are we doing?</i>

40:08.647 --> 40:11.012
You can't buy what he's got, yeah?

40:12.047 --> 40:13.929
Especially if he's not selling.

40:21.530 --> 40:23.480
Where'd you learn to do all this?

40:23.481 --> 40:25.246
Raising sons.

40:25.247 --> 40:28.413
They went through clothes
like you wouldn't believe.

40:28.414 --> 40:31.763
Just, you know, made sense
to make all our own stuff.

40:31.764 --> 40:33.313
At least they're both boys.

40:33.314 --> 40:35.079
Probably just hand
stuff down, right?

40:35.080 --> 40:36.313
Yeah, I wish.

40:36.314 --> 40:38.746
Those two, they're
like chalk and cheese

40:38.747 --> 40:41.129
when it comes to their
taste in things.

40:41.130 --> 40:43.396
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:43.397 --> 40:47.962
When they're not, look out.
It can get ugly.

40:57.896 --> 41:00.463
Didn't expect you
guys back so soon.

41:00.464 --> 41:03.629
- Manage to sell anything?
- Ta-dah!

41:03.630 --> 41:05.446
Where did it all go?

41:05.447 --> 41:07.646
Inside barrels all the way
from here to Esperance.

41:07.647 --> 41:10.279
They saw the film, went nuts.
It was like a feeding frenzy.

41:11.780 --> 41:15.095
- It's unreal, man.
- Yeah, it is.

41:18.696 --> 41:20.429
What's this?

41:20.430 --> 41:23.596
Aw, it's a little something for
getting us off the ground.

41:23.597 --> 41:25.578
Plenty more where that came from.

41:58.080 --> 42:01.313
Mmm. What time is it?

42:01.314 --> 42:03.079
A little after 3:00.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.096
I should go.

42:05.097 --> 42:08.561
You could always just stay here.

42:12.096 --> 42:14.595
Nice try, Andrew Kelly.

42:16.930 --> 42:20.445
Good luck tomorrow.

42:24.945 --> 42:26.847
<i>As you can see,</i>

42:26.848 --> 42:29.946
<i>sales projections, comparisons
with overseas competitors,</i>

42:29.947 --> 42:32.797
ideas for new products
down the line.

42:32.798 --> 42:36.913
The challenge here, Andrew, is that
you're asking for a business loan.

42:36.914 --> 42:39.446
But what you're talking
about is a leisure activity.

42:39.447 --> 42:41.530
Either way, we just sold
out our entire inventory.

42:41.531 --> 42:43.346
Out of the back of your Kombi.

42:43.347 --> 42:45.130
You said to start thinking
like a businessman.

42:45.131 --> 42:47.145
That's what you said.
That's what I'm doing.

42:47.146 --> 42:50.396
We lend to farmers
because they grow crops.

42:50.397 --> 42:52.062
<i>People need to eat.</i>

42:52.063 --> 42:55.146
Where exactly is your market?

42:55.147 --> 42:58.429
Are you kidding me? 95% of
Aussies live on the coast.

42:58.430 --> 43:01.129
Our gear makes living
on the coast better.

43:01.130 --> 43:03.496
I would have thought our market
was pretty bloody obvious.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.096
- <i>Andrew...</i>
- That's just here.

43:05.097 --> 43:07.380
Now we can reach people all
over the world, Mr. Grumley.

43:07.381 --> 43:10.713
- Look, Andrew, I hear what you're saying.
- How?

43:10.714 --> 43:13.413
I'm sorry, James?

43:13.414 --> 43:15.497
How can you hear what he's saying

43:15.498 --> 43:19.245
when you've got your head
shoved so far up your own ass?

43:27.613 --> 43:30.713
I thought that went well.

43:30.714 --> 43:32.346
Unbelievable.

43:32.347 --> 43:34.747
What? I was doing you a favor.

43:34.748 --> 43:38.280
You gotta be a farmer or a logger
to score a loan in this town.

43:38.281 --> 43:40.945
You gotta get a haircut.

43:40.946 --> 43:43.246
They're never going
to give us a red cent

43:43.247 --> 43:46.945
because we're on the
outside looking in.

43:48.379 --> 43:50.713
You know what?

43:50.714 --> 43:53.078
I'm cool with that.

44:02.063 --> 44:03.629
J.B.'s right, man.

44:03.630 --> 44:06.346
<i>You can't buy what we've got,</i>

44:06.347 --> 44:08.678
especially if we're not selling.

44:16.262 --> 44:18.430
<i>I've been wanting to bust this out</i>

44:18.431 --> 44:21.679
<i>since I got back from Indonesia.</i>

44:25.380 --> 44:30.279
And on the eighth day, God
created this java lava.

44:30.280 --> 44:33.612
<i>Stickiest hash this
side of Lebanon.</i>

44:37.780 --> 44:41.428
Ooh.

44:43.446 --> 44:45.596
Are you serious?

44:45.597 --> 44:49.413
You brought hash back
from Indo on a plane?

44:49.414 --> 44:50.996
Sure did, officer.

44:50.997 --> 44:53.196
It was too far to paddle.

44:56.646 --> 44:59.446
Who's got a light?

45:01.880 --> 45:03.911
Oh, it is on.

45:14.129 --> 45:16.396
<i>And it was in that moment, man,</i>

45:16.397 --> 45:20.996
<i>that I realized the
past is behind you.</i>

45:20.997 --> 45:24.246
And in front of you where
that wave stretches

45:24.247 --> 45:28.278
all the way out, that's
the future, man.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.145
Righteous, huh?

45:39.346 --> 45:41.311
Hey.

45:43.962 --> 45:45.762
I've got no idea
what I'm looking at.

45:45.763 --> 45:47.945
Oh, it's all bullshit, really.

45:47.946 --> 45:49.646
Basically it means we're never
going to make ends meet

45:49.647 --> 45:51.213
working out of a backyard shed.

45:51.214 --> 45:52.713
To really make it work,

45:52.714 --> 45:55.696
we need what they call
the economies of scale.

45:55.697 --> 45:58.679
You like that?
Read it in the paper.

45:58.680 --> 46:02.313
It's just a fancy way of saying, the more
boards we make, the cheaper they are.

46:02.314 --> 46:04.912
So we either expand or we fold.

46:04.913 --> 46:06.696
There's no in between.

46:06.697 --> 46:09.413
I don't suppose you got a rich
Uncle you can sponge off?

46:09.414 --> 46:11.380
I don't even have a poor one, mate.

46:11.381 --> 46:13.812
All right, enough business.
I'm getting a drink.

46:13.813 --> 46:16.128
- You want one, Percy?
- Oh, thanks, love.

46:43.180 --> 46:45.345
Whoo!

46:54.629 --> 46:57.511
Hello. What do we got
here, sweetheart?

46:59.746 --> 47:03.045
Take a good look, boys. Might be
the closest you get for a while.

47:03.046 --> 47:04.896
I don't know.
Keep talking like that

47:04.897 --> 47:07.296
and I might take a closer look
before the night's through.

47:07.297 --> 47:09.363
What do you say?

47:09.364 --> 47:11.597
Sweetheart, I wouldn't
fuck you with his dick.

47:14.230 --> 47:16.312
Oi.

47:16.313 --> 47:17.946
Oi!

47:17.947 --> 47:20.444
Come here, you skank!

47:22.913 --> 47:24.313
<i>Andy!</i>

47:26.896 --> 47:28.563
<i>Andy, watch out!</i>

47:30.364 --> 47:32.330
Get off, you animal!

47:32.331 --> 47:35.496
- Ahh! Fuck!
- <i>Jimmy, watch out!</i>

47:37.779 --> 47:40.745
Ah!

47:43.745 --> 47:45.613
<i>Stop it!</i>

47:45.614 --> 47:47.846
- Come on, mate! Come on, surfer boy!
- <i>Stop it!</i>

47:47.847 --> 47:50.163
Come on, wax head!

47:50.164 --> 47:51.695
- Hey! Hey!
- Stop it!

47:53.547 --> 47:55.429
You know, I think that's
just about enough of that.

47:55.430 --> 47:57.662
Hey!

47:58.879 --> 48:01.911
It's got two barrels
for a reason, brother.

48:06.362 --> 48:09.413
Small town, Andy.

48:09.414 --> 48:11.695
<i>Let's go, boys!</i>

48:12.712 --> 48:13.712
- You all right?
- Yeah.

48:13.713 --> 48:15.180
<i>Have a good night, wax heads!</i>

48:15.181 --> 48:17.762
- I'm good, man.
- That's right, everybody.

48:17.763 --> 48:19.363
Peace.

48:21.214 --> 48:23.645
Whoo!

48:31.329 --> 48:33.263
<i>My pocket don't drive...</i>

48:33.264 --> 48:35.062
Lani?

48:35.063 --> 48:36.563
Lani?

48:36.564 --> 48:40.212
<i>My mother treats me slow</i>

48:40.213 --> 48:45.061
<i>My statue's got a
concrete heart...</i>

48:45.963 --> 48:47.562
Lani, what the hell are you doing?

48:47.563 --> 48:50.029
Are you... Are you kidding me?

48:50.030 --> 48:51.729
I had that totally under control.

48:51.730 --> 48:52.896
How was I supposed to know?

48:52.897 --> 48:54.829
I had a life before
I came here, Andy.

48:54.830 --> 48:56.212
- I told you that.
- Okay.

48:56.213 --> 48:58.296
I've dealt with that type
of dickhead all my life.

48:58.297 --> 49:00.212
- All right.
- I don't need you or anyone else

49:00.213 --> 49:02.963
- trying to look out for me, all right?
- All right.

49:02.964 --> 49:05.329
- Look at your face.
- Take it easy.

49:05.330 --> 49:07.813
- Big tough guy, coming to my rescue.
- Ow!

49:07.814 --> 49:09.746
- I get it.
- Bunch of cavemen.

49:09.747 --> 49:11.329
I'll still have to thank
him next time I see him.

49:11.330 --> 49:13.728
- Yeah, for what?
- Ow.

49:43.979 --> 49:47.729
Hey, look what I found.

49:47.730 --> 49:50.195
- Hey.
- What's all this?

49:50.196 --> 49:51.279
Check it out.

49:52.646 --> 49:55.745
My cousin's from Torquay.

49:55.746 --> 50:00.078
And he reckons it lets him
see right inside the wave.

50:02.528 --> 50:04.827
It's radical, huh?

50:09.963 --> 50:12.380
You want first go?

50:12.381 --> 50:14.810
Maybe later.

50:18.545 --> 50:20.662
It's all the more for us, mate.

50:20.663 --> 50:22.928
Ha!

50:24.430 --> 50:26.361
You can have first go.

50:27.196 --> 50:28.678
Okay, cool.

50:28.679 --> 50:31.778
Hey, Gussy, don't worry about him.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.279
Ha.

50:33.280 --> 50:37.361
<i>Delightful rain</i>

50:38.662 --> 50:42.396
<i>And the whirling wind</i>

50:42.397 --> 50:47.511
<i>Blows it's song around the bay</i>

50:49.729 --> 50:52.995
<i>And the whirling wind</i>

50:52.996 --> 50:54.745
<i>Knows my name.</i>

50:54.746 --> 50:57.062
Makaha.

50:59.462 --> 51:01.262
Makaha.

51:06.064 --> 51:07.794
What?

51:09.296 --> 51:10.863
What?

51:10.864 --> 51:12.829
It's a place, you idiot.

51:12.830 --> 51:15.529
It's where I grew up.

51:17.963 --> 51:19.796
<i>I can see why you left.</i>

51:19.797 --> 51:21.896
Looks awful.

51:21.897 --> 51:23.962
It does okay.

51:23.963 --> 51:25.961
You miss it?

51:27.462 --> 51:29.329
Not right this second.

51:29.330 --> 51:31.762
<i>Lani?</i>

51:31.763 --> 51:33.263
<i>Yeah?</i>

51:35.462 --> 51:37.796
Quick surf before breaky?

51:37.797 --> 51:41.111
Uh, yeah yeah. I'll be right out.

51:41.896 --> 51:44.861
Good.

52:42.412 --> 52:44.078
Perce?

52:47.612 --> 52:49.595
Absolutely not, mate. Nah.

52:49.596 --> 52:51.728
Your payout's meant to support
you in your retirement,

52:51.729 --> 52:53.312
not invest in the
fucking surf business.

52:53.313 --> 52:54.979
It's not for you to say.

52:54.980 --> 53:00.029
I mean, all that stuff about economies
and scales and what have you.

53:00.030 --> 53:02.562
Who knows? You might
be on to something.

53:02.563 --> 53:04.662
Percy, the bank took one look and
laughed us out to the street, mate.

53:04.663 --> 53:07.328
I think they know a little more
about smart investing than you do.

53:07.329 --> 53:08.796
I've been around the block.

53:08.797 --> 53:11.395
I know a good thing when I see it.

53:12.545 --> 53:15.528
I've even found the perfect place.

53:18.478 --> 53:20.412
Ah!

53:33.929 --> 53:35.728
Oh.

53:52.495 --> 53:54.411
Ha! Crafty old bugger.

53:57.778 --> 53:59.612
Oh, great, fellas. Thanks.

53:59.613 --> 54:02.144
Just put it here.

54:04.412 --> 54:06.512
Oh, hey.

54:06.513 --> 54:09.078
Hold on, hold on.

54:10.163 --> 54:12.645
Mass production, here we come.

54:12.646 --> 54:16.412
Oh, relax, comrade. It's a sewing
machine, not a conveyor belt.

54:16.413 --> 54:19.728
Check it out! Fancy.

54:19.729 --> 54:21.462
- Know how to work it?
- No idea.

54:28.778 --> 54:30.879
Mr. Grumley?

54:30.880 --> 54:32.478
Great day, eh?

54:32.479 --> 54:35.146
Uh, yes, lovely. Thanks, Andrew.

54:35.147 --> 54:37.295
Hey, thanks for
suggesting the name.

54:37.296 --> 54:40.029
It works perfect, eh?

54:40.030 --> 54:41.510
Hey, Grumley!

54:42.545 --> 54:44.762
You ning nong!

54:44.763 --> 54:48.079
Looking good, Jim!

54:48.080 --> 54:51.345
Aw, Jim, that's beautiful.

54:51.346 --> 54:54.629
- Hey, get a photo, will you, love?
- Ah.

54:54.630 --> 54:56.879
Come on, let's have a photo.

54:58.034 --> 55:01.862
This is either the start of something
cool, or the beginning of the end.

55:01.863 --> 55:05.479
- Oh, for God's sake, get in the photo.
- Go, go, go, go!

55:05.480 --> 55:07.745
<i>Cheese!</i>

55:07.746 --> 55:10.328
Hey!

55:10.329 --> 55:12.445
All right, before you go, I think
this is a good opportunity for me

55:12.446 --> 55:14.361
to give the rousing speech
you're all expecting.

55:14.362 --> 55:17.146
- Here we go.
- None of you will be surprised to hear

55:17.147 --> 55:19.029
that I don't know the first
thing about running a business.

55:19.030 --> 55:21.445
I thought they were generous letting
you finish secondary school.

55:21.446 --> 55:23.845
Thank you, mom. Smile for
the camera, over here.

55:23.846 --> 55:26.245
Still, I reckon we've
got to have some rules.

55:26.246 --> 55:27.812
- <i>Right, Jim?</i>
- What are we, girl guides?

55:27.813 --> 55:30.129
The first rule is this:
When there's surf, we surf

55:30.130 --> 55:33.411
and when it's flat, we work.

55:34.162 --> 55:36.096
And guess what?

55:41.879 --> 55:44.561
<i>They want to get my</i>

55:49.679 --> 55:51.411
<i>They want to get my</i>

55:51.412 --> 55:54.895
<i>Gold on the ceiling</i>

55:54.896 --> 55:56.311
<i>I ain't blind</i>

55:56.312 --> 55:59.062
<i>It's just a matter of time</i>

55:59.063 --> 56:02.628
<i>Before you steal it</i>

56:02.629 --> 56:04.079
<i>It's all right</i>

56:04.080 --> 56:06.978
<i>Ain't no guard in my house...</i>

56:10.762 --> 56:13.678
Yeah!

56:26.228 --> 56:27.778
Thanks.

56:30.362 --> 56:32.562
Hey, uh...

56:32.563 --> 56:34.361
Everything all right with Jimmy?

56:34.362 --> 56:36.063
- Yeah, why?
- I don't know.

56:36.064 --> 56:37.428
He's just acting a little weird.

56:37.429 --> 56:39.796
Aw, he's fine. You,
on the other hand...

56:39.797 --> 56:43.261
I'm gonna need you to work back
late tonight, Miss Kealoha.

56:43.262 --> 56:47.395
Of course. Anything
pressing, Mr. Kelly?

56:47.396 --> 56:49.511
I'm sure I could
think of something.

57:04.245 --> 57:06.378
Hey, mom, are you back here?

57:06.379 --> 57:08.012
<i>Tony Hemsley, you should
be ashamed of yourself.</i>

57:08.013 --> 57:09.545
- You all right?
- Yeah yeah yeah, I'm fine.

57:09.546 --> 57:11.545
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is this about?

57:11.546 --> 57:13.178
No idea.

57:13.179 --> 57:16.312
I think you do, son. The whole
town knows what you lot are into.

57:16.313 --> 57:18.695
What I'm into? This is bullshit.

57:18.696 --> 57:20.361
You got nothing better to do
than hassle innocent people?

57:20.362 --> 57:23.312
- Andrew?
- I didn't know surfing was a crime just yet.

57:23.313 --> 57:24.745
It's not about the
surfing, young cock.

57:24.746 --> 57:25.829
- Andrew!
- Mom!

57:25.830 --> 57:28.128
A little bird told me about the
other business you're into.

57:28.129 --> 57:31.194
- What other business?
- Come on, mate.

57:31.195 --> 57:34.846
I've had an eye on your hippie mates
ever since they moved to town.

57:34.847 --> 57:37.211
And now that you lot
are all so cozy,

57:37.212 --> 57:41.395
I'm gonna keep an eye
on you lot too. Got it?

57:41.396 --> 57:42.794
Good.

58:06.361 --> 58:10.612
So now I've got cops asking questions
about drugs in my factory.

58:10.613 --> 58:12.895
- Huh?
- Just breathe easy.

58:12.896 --> 58:14.546
Center your chi.

58:14.547 --> 58:16.161
Eh, fuck your chi.

58:18.678 --> 58:20.410
Relax.

58:22.962 --> 58:25.879
They got nothing on me.
They got nothing on you.

58:25.880 --> 58:29.311
- They know about the drugs.
- They don't know shit.

58:29.312 --> 58:31.245
Small-town cops.

58:31.246 --> 58:33.445
Just be cool

58:33.446 --> 58:36.929
and they'll get bored and go away.

58:36.930 --> 58:40.178
And what if they don't? You get to pack
your bags up, you sail on out of here.

58:40.179 --> 58:41.295
We live here.

58:41.296 --> 58:45.128
- So?
- So.

58:46.295 --> 58:49.745
So you threaten that,
you threaten me, man.

58:49.746 --> 58:51.195
You got that?

58:51.196 --> 58:53.228
Yeah.

58:55.212 --> 58:58.995
Andy? In through your nose...

59:00.463 --> 59:02.395
And out through your mouth.

59:09.362 --> 59:12.161
I don't do credit, man.

59:12.162 --> 59:13.528
Never have.

59:13.529 --> 59:15.545
Mate, it's for Tina, but.

59:15.546 --> 59:17.829
She's cool, right?

59:17.830 --> 59:19.462
- Tina?
- Yeah.

59:19.463 --> 59:22.361
Why ain't she here begging
me for a taste, huh?

59:23.429 --> 59:25.695
Stick to the weed, man.

59:25.696 --> 59:28.194
Hey, mate, I get paid next week.

59:28.195 --> 59:30.911
There's got to be
something we can do.

59:32.445 --> 59:35.911
And you know, Andy, he doesn't
have to know anything about it.

59:43.111 --> 59:46.778
Oi, come on.

59:55.962 --> 59:57.627
Oh!

59:59.162 --> 01:00:01.195
We don't open till 10:00, Tom.

01:00:01.196 --> 01:00:03.711
You're not scaring any customers
away until then, mate.

01:00:10.378 --> 01:00:12.746
How long you reckon they
can keep this up for?

01:00:12.747 --> 01:00:14.311
Longer than us.

01:00:14.312 --> 01:00:16.045
Great.

01:00:17.245 --> 01:00:19.945
- Gus turned up yet?
- No.

01:00:19.946 --> 01:00:22.012
Maybe he's got a bet
going with the cops...

01:00:22.013 --> 01:00:23.762
See who can put us out
of business first.

01:00:23.763 --> 01:00:25.594
Terrific.

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.161
Hey.

01:00:34.162 --> 01:00:35.394
Hey.

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:48.562
You gotta be kidding me.

01:00:48.563 --> 01:00:51.112
How the hell am I supposed
to compete with that?

01:00:51.113 --> 01:00:54.045
You know, Sunny's won the
Smirnoff two years running.

01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:56.262
I can't get a pro to
pick up the phone,

01:00:56.263 --> 01:00:57.662
let alone wear our gear.

01:00:57.663 --> 01:01:01.162
Well, if you ask me, I think
it looks kind of stupid.

01:01:01.163 --> 01:01:03.462
- Yeah, right.
- <i>I'm serious.</i>

01:01:03.463 --> 01:01:06.445
They're trying to get a
surfer to look like a model.

01:01:06.446 --> 01:01:09.845
I don't know why they don't just
shoot him doing what he's good at.

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:26.078
Thanks for coming.

01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:28.410
Yeah, well, you should thank Lani.

01:01:29.262 --> 01:01:30.695
<i>Sure you're up for this?</i>

01:01:30.696 --> 01:01:34.129
You know, we can wait for
it to drop off if you want.

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:36.078
And why would we want to do that?

01:01:37.062 --> 01:01:38.878
It's perfect.

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:42.429
Check out the big
balls on Andy, huh?

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:44.028
About time you grew some.

01:01:45.144 --> 01:01:46.878
All aboard!

01:02:08.679 --> 01:02:12.361
You know they call it the
morgue for a reason, right?

01:02:13.678 --> 01:02:15.695
Well, if you're not up for
it, Jim, just say so.

01:02:15.696 --> 01:02:19.045
<i>I won't tell anyone you turned down
the chance to surf a mountain.</i>

01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:23.711
Aw, fuck it.

01:02:28.462 --> 01:02:29.544
Yeah!

01:02:47.195 --> 01:02:48.978
Come on.

01:03:00.578 --> 01:03:03.145
- What happened?
- It's impossible.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.761
Way too much water moving under me.

01:03:05.762 --> 01:03:07.162
You know, the north
shore boys reckon

01:03:07.163 --> 01:03:08.912
the hardest part isn't riding them,

01:03:08.913 --> 01:03:10.528
it's catching them.

01:03:20.811 --> 01:03:22.844
Go, go, go, go!

01:03:26.528 --> 01:03:29.110
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:17.861
- Haaa! Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:04:20.478 --> 01:04:22.410
Whooo!

01:04:24.579 --> 01:04:27.445
Yeah, boy!

01:04:27.446 --> 01:04:29.728
Yeah!

01:04:40.028 --> 01:04:42.511
Whoo!

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.378
Whooo!

01:04:44.379 --> 01:04:45.695
Hey!

01:04:45.696 --> 01:04:47.878
- Did you see the size of that last one?
- Yeah.

01:04:47.879 --> 01:04:50.778
He wasn't riding giants
in the Ocean King ad.

01:04:50.779 --> 01:04:53.711
- I'll tell you that much, mate.
- That was another level, man.

01:04:53.712 --> 01:04:56.128
- One last one while we're here.
- Nah, it's getting hairy.

01:04:56.129 --> 01:04:58.212
- <i>We got your shot.</i>
- Come on, man up, will ya?

01:04:58.213 --> 01:05:00.760
You got your publicity.
Let's go, huh?

01:05:01.545 --> 01:05:04.210
Righto, keep your shirt on.

01:05:12.362 --> 01:05:14.128
Close enough, man. Come on!

01:05:14.129 --> 01:05:16.144
You're gonna flood it!

01:05:21.812 --> 01:05:25.311
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on!

01:05:26.445 --> 01:05:29.644
We got too much weight. Jump!

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:33.661
Don't you lose that!

01:05:37.178 --> 01:05:40.244
Ahh!

01:06:04.095 --> 01:06:06.312
- No worries, boys.
- Careful next time.

01:06:06.313 --> 01:06:08.045
- Thanks, fellas.
- See ya.

01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:10.427
- Sorry for the hassle!
- Yeah.

01:06:12.261 --> 01:06:16.194
Oi! J.B.!

01:06:17.594 --> 01:06:19.893
Oi!

01:06:44.961 --> 01:06:47.861
- You coming in or what?
- No.

01:06:47.862 --> 01:06:50.478
Can't do much till Gus shows up.

01:06:50.479 --> 01:06:54.344
No point shaping any more
boards without a glasser.

01:06:59.145 --> 01:07:01.010
<i>It's just a mock-up.</i>

01:07:02.162 --> 01:07:04.195
The ad agency's still tweaking it.

01:07:04.196 --> 01:07:06.661
So a real pro event?

01:07:06.662 --> 01:07:08.095
Uh-huh.

01:07:08.096 --> 01:07:11.527
The top surfers from all
around the world here

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.778
in this tiny town, with huge waves.

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:17.895
It's a big chance for Ocean King
to step onto the big stage.

01:07:17.896 --> 01:07:20.728
We've already booked Sunny Townsend
as the face of everything.

01:07:20.729 --> 01:07:22.728
Sounds like a great opportunity.

01:07:22.729 --> 01:07:25.261
Which I want to extend to you.

01:07:25.262 --> 01:07:28.278
See, I know how hard it is
setting up your own business.

01:07:28.279 --> 01:07:30.311
I also know there'll be
a whole lot of hoopla

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:32.144
going on around here
during the contest.

01:07:32.145 --> 01:07:33.945
So I want to make you an offer...

01:07:33.946 --> 01:07:35.761
I want to give you guys first crack

01:07:35.762 --> 01:07:38.478
at stocking Ocean King gear here,

01:07:38.479 --> 01:07:41.227
in your shop, on credit.

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:45.395
Wow. Gee, thanks, Gordon.

01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:48.544
Um, probably not right
for us just now.

01:07:48.545 --> 01:07:51.195
K-Mart want in.

01:07:51.196 --> 01:07:53.494
I'm stalling them, but I
can't hold them off forever.

01:07:53.495 --> 01:07:55.644
Yeah, well, you've got to
do what you've got to do.

01:07:55.645 --> 01:07:59.045
You... you are kidding
me, aren't you?

01:07:59.046 --> 01:08:02.427
Ocean King and drift...
could be the perfect fit.

01:08:02.428 --> 01:08:05.110
Just not right now, Gordon.

01:08:06.295 --> 01:08:08.478
Lots of work to do, mate.

01:08:11.811 --> 01:08:14.345
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

01:08:14.346 --> 01:08:16.310
Just don't leave it too long.

01:08:21.228 --> 01:08:23.428
G'day. Can I help you?

01:08:23.429 --> 01:08:24.895
How you goin', mate?

01:08:24.895 --> 01:08:27.428
Looking for a Gus Doran.

01:08:27.429 --> 01:08:28.761
Does he work here?

01:08:28.761 --> 01:08:30.426
That's debatable.

01:08:30.428 --> 01:08:32.060
<i>I got a delivery for him.</i>

01:08:32.062 --> 01:08:35.644
30 blanks.

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:38.527
- <i>Wanna sign this for me?</i>
- Do I have a choice?

01:08:41.245 --> 01:08:44.210
30 blanks? Thank you, Gus.

01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:47.011
Sorry, man.

01:08:47.013 --> 01:08:49.359
He's killing me.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.993
Finally emerges.

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:06.261
Thought I'd lost you
there for a while.

01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:07.859
Hmm?

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.560
Still no sign of Gus.

01:09:13.562 --> 01:09:16.926
It's almost two weeks now.
I'm starting to get worried.

01:09:17.962 --> 01:09:21.060
You know, when I was his age, I
used to disappear for months.

01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:24.643
He'll be fine.

01:09:27.145 --> 01:09:29.611
Yeah, nice seeing you too, J.B.

01:10:17.912 --> 01:10:19.411
Drift surf gear.

01:10:19.412 --> 01:10:21.761
Andy, I found Gus.

01:10:21.762 --> 01:10:26.060
He's, uh... He's real messed up.

01:10:27.294 --> 01:10:29.394
All skin and bone.

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:32.845
- <i>You still there?</i>
- Yeah.

01:10:32.846 --> 01:10:34.778
<i>He's not good, mate.</i>

01:10:34.779 --> 01:10:36.527
I don't know what to do.

01:10:36.528 --> 01:10:38.960
I'll bring him straight
over, all right?

01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:43.595
Take him to the hospital, Jim.

01:10:43.596 --> 01:10:45.327
Don't bring him here.

01:11:04.577 --> 01:11:06.594
Andy!

01:11:15.744 --> 01:11:18.211
<i>He'll get worse before
he gets better.</i>

01:11:18.212 --> 01:11:20.494
Staring at him won't help.

01:11:42.028 --> 01:11:44.477
<i>Feeling any better?</i>

01:11:44.478 --> 01:11:46.745
Yeah.

01:11:46.746 --> 01:11:49.676
I'm good as gold, mate.

01:11:52.644 --> 01:11:54.378
Do you want anything?

01:11:54.379 --> 01:11:56.844
Yeah yeah.

01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:02.960
Could you take me back with you?

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.761
- Gus...
- Please?

01:12:06.762 --> 01:12:10.861
I don't think I can handle
it out here on my own.

01:12:10.862 --> 01:12:13.777
Ah!

01:12:13.778 --> 01:12:15.644
<i>Yeah, we've been through all that.</i>

01:12:15.645 --> 01:12:17.645
Just stay here, yeah?
Enjoy the zen.

01:12:17.646 --> 01:12:19.444
- Oh, come off it, man.
- What, man?

01:12:19.445 --> 01:12:21.561
Oh, I could just have
a home-cooked meal,

01:12:21.562 --> 01:12:25.894
you know, a proper
lie-down, I'll come good.

01:12:25.895 --> 01:12:27.444
Hey, of course you will, man.

01:12:27.445 --> 01:12:30.895
Do it down here, away
from all the other shit.

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:33.294
Yeah, well, I'm fine, mate.

01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:37.078
Yeah, you're the perfect
picture of health, man.

01:12:38.879 --> 01:12:42.594
Hey, listen. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:12:42.595 --> 01:12:44.427
Tough it out here for the weekend.

01:12:44.428 --> 01:12:45.911
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:12:45.912 --> 01:12:48.394
I'll come back, we'll
go for a wave.

01:12:48.395 --> 01:12:50.843
<i>All right?</i>

01:12:52.111 --> 01:12:54.744
<i>Cool?</i>

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:56.594
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:12:56.595 --> 01:12:58.460
Yeah, cool, James.

01:13:12.978 --> 01:13:15.961
Saw the light on, thought somebody
might be knocking off the joint.

01:13:15.962 --> 01:13:18.476
Yeah, good luck to him.
There's nothing to steal.

01:13:22.211 --> 01:13:23.510
Hmm.

01:13:23.511 --> 01:13:25.277
Might have missed your calling.

01:13:25.278 --> 01:13:28.844
Well, necessity's the mother of
invention, and all that shit.

01:13:30.878 --> 01:13:33.694
Is he all right?

01:13:33.695 --> 01:13:36.745
He's down the coast. He'll be fine.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.527
Right.

01:13:44.344 --> 01:13:47.527
You know, it wouldn't kill
you to ask for help, yeah?

01:14:15.211 --> 01:14:16.794
Morning, Mrs. Kelly.

01:14:16.795 --> 01:14:18.344
Good morning, Tom. How are you?

01:14:18.345 --> 01:14:21.461
- Mmm, bit nippy.
- God, it's bloody cold, isn't it?

01:14:36.194 --> 01:14:38.227
What the hell?

01:14:46.177 --> 01:14:48.461
Do you want to come in
and warm up for a bit?

01:14:48.462 --> 01:14:49.928
No, that's really not allowed.

01:14:49.929 --> 01:14:52.160
Well, just come inside for a cuppa

01:14:52.161 --> 01:14:53.761
and then you can get back to it.

01:14:53.762 --> 01:14:55.495
Technically I'm on a stakeout here.

01:14:55.496 --> 01:14:57.544
Oh, for God's sake,
Tom, it's a cup of tea.

01:14:57.545 --> 01:14:59.961
It's hardly hash cookies.

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:02.744
You still want to know why the
cops trashed our place, did you?

01:15:02.745 --> 01:15:04.644
- Calm down, mate.
- <i>Calm down?!</i>

01:15:04.645 --> 01:15:06.561
There's several kilos
of heroin here.

01:15:06.562 --> 01:15:08.361
There's a cop parked out the front.

01:15:08.362 --> 01:15:10.561
Wonder where he got
the idea from, huh?

01:15:10.562 --> 01:15:13.244
Surfers have been moving their
stuff in boards for years.

01:15:13.245 --> 01:15:14.360
<i>I didn't invent it.</i>

01:15:14.361 --> 01:15:16.227
We should have been clearer
with the fuckin' rules!

01:15:16.228 --> 01:15:19.127
It's not my responsibility,
you fucker!

01:15:19.128 --> 01:15:20.394
<i>Whoa, hang on, hang on, hang on.</i>

01:15:20.395 --> 01:15:22.127
Someone's definitely
gonna miss this.

01:15:22.128 --> 01:15:23.977
Listen, we've got to
help him right now,

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:26.411
not throw him under
a bus. He's one of us.

01:15:26.412 --> 01:15:29.977
He's a junkie, Jimmy! He's using
our factory to import heroin!

01:15:29.978 --> 01:15:31.977
Have you got that in your head yet?

01:15:31.978 --> 01:15:33.644
Fuck, man, he's family!

01:15:33.645 --> 01:15:36.595
Grow up, Jim! He's put
our family at risk.

01:15:36.596 --> 01:15:38.361
He's put you and me,
mom, everyone at risk,

01:15:38.362 --> 01:15:39.943
everything we've ever
worked for at risk!

01:15:39.944 --> 01:15:41.761
Yeah, you're doing a pretty fuckin'
good job of that all by yourself.

01:15:41.762 --> 01:15:44.376
- Ah!
- <i>Hey!</i>

01:15:51.694 --> 01:15:54.043
You're a real chip off the
old block, aren't you?

01:15:54.044 --> 01:15:56.493
Andy, you there?

01:15:59.127 --> 01:16:01.027
<i>Jim, you all right?</i>

01:16:01.028 --> 01:16:03.360
- Jim?
- <i>Yeah, he's fine.</i>

01:16:03.361 --> 01:16:06.627
Just the planer caught an edge,
whacked him on the nose there.

01:16:11.394 --> 01:16:14.044
Just the whole vibe's
just changed right now.

01:16:14.045 --> 01:16:16.177
- The vibe.
- Peace, brother.

01:16:19.377 --> 01:16:23.061
Hey, I just brought Tom
in for a cup of tea.

01:16:23.062 --> 01:16:26.360
- <i>It's freezing out there.</i>
- One step ahead of you, mom.

01:16:26.361 --> 01:16:29.326
G'day, Tom. Milk, sugar?

01:16:43.761 --> 01:16:45.761
Been looking for you.

01:16:53.762 --> 01:16:55.994
<i>Haven't got all day.</i>

01:16:55.995 --> 01:16:58.211
Yeah, well, you know, maybe
it hasn't come in yet.

01:16:58.212 --> 01:17:00.394
<i>I spoke to the supplier.
It's been delivered.</i>

01:17:00.395 --> 01:17:02.977
Stop wasting my fuckin' time.

01:17:02.978 --> 01:17:05.644
Relax, mate. I'm...

01:17:05.645 --> 01:17:09.661
I'm just saying that you hope...

01:17:09.662 --> 01:17:12.845
I just hope it hasn't been
shaped and sold already...

01:17:12.846 --> 01:17:14.977
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

01:17:14.978 --> 01:17:17.711
That gear belongs to
some very heavy people.

01:17:17.712 --> 01:17:19.561
Right? There's not much they
won't do to get it back.

01:17:19.562 --> 01:17:22.893
Which puts me in an awkward
position, do you understand?

01:17:22.894 --> 01:17:24.694
Oh, I underst...

01:17:24.695 --> 01:17:26.710
Ah!

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:29.726
Do you understand?!

01:17:33.977 --> 01:17:36.210
<i>Hmm?</i>

01:17:36.211 --> 01:17:39.027
- Well?
- Okay, yeah. Fair enough.

01:17:39.028 --> 01:17:41.159
Fair enough, yeah.

01:17:42.694 --> 01:17:45.126
I get it.

01:17:48.943 --> 01:17:51.711
I'm sorry, man.

01:17:51.712 --> 01:17:54.193
I took your stuff.

01:17:55.177 --> 01:17:56.644
Excuse me?

01:17:56.645 --> 01:17:59.478
I took your stuff and I
went through it all.

01:17:59.479 --> 01:18:00.993
The lot?

01:18:00.994 --> 01:18:03.460
What, two kilos in
a week, you blew?

01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:06.727
I'm so sorry.

01:18:06.728 --> 01:18:08.611
Don't you fuckin' lie to me!

01:18:08.612 --> 01:18:11.161
Oh! I took it all, you dickhead!

01:18:11.162 --> 01:18:13.827
Do I look like a fuckin'
idiot to you? Hey?!

01:18:20.611 --> 01:18:24.078
Tomorrow you're going to
come bring me my gear.

01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:26.310
Because if you don't, I'm
gonna come back here

01:18:26.311 --> 01:18:29.061
and I won't be as forgiving
next time, do you understand?

01:18:29.062 --> 01:18:30.261
Yeah.

01:18:30.262 --> 01:18:33.060
<i>Oh!</i>

01:18:50.111 --> 01:18:52.177
<i>How's the nose?</i>

01:18:54.479 --> 01:18:57.277
It's still there.

01:18:57.278 --> 01:18:59.710
Well, I guess that's
something, right?

01:19:03.011 --> 01:19:05.610
How did we end up here?

01:19:07.311 --> 01:19:09.977
Welcome to the real world.

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:12.344
Screw the real world.

01:19:12.345 --> 01:19:15.943
I'm gonna get out of here. I'm
gonna grab Gus and leave,

01:19:15.944 --> 01:19:19.142
go up the coast,
somewhere hard to find.

01:19:21.344 --> 01:19:23.976
Just leave.

01:19:30.544 --> 01:19:33.042
What do you reckon?

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.326
Can I get you a cup of tea, Kat?

01:21:47.127 --> 01:21:49.528
Kat?

01:21:49.529 --> 01:21:51.360
Hey.

01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:56.359
I'm fine. Just a little
bit wobbly today.

01:21:57.727 --> 01:21:59.827
Okay.

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.660
Hey, it'll be all right.

01:22:03.661 --> 01:22:05.827
- I promise.
- Yeah.

01:22:05.828 --> 01:22:08.760
I'm sorry. This is really stupid.

01:22:08.761 --> 01:22:10.993
I'm not usually
like this. I'm fine.

01:22:10.994 --> 01:22:12.727
Cup of tea would be lovely.

01:22:12.728 --> 01:22:14.327
All right.

01:22:14.328 --> 01:22:16.392
Thanks, sweetie.

01:22:51.893 --> 01:22:54.593
Jeez, that's a bugger, isn't it?

01:22:56.927 --> 01:23:00.593
<i>Hello, Andrew. How you holdin' up?</i>

01:23:00.594 --> 01:23:01.860
Me, I'm fine.

01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:04.910
Terrible business, Gus.

01:23:04.911 --> 01:23:07.309
Ah, he was a good kid. I liked him.

01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:11.394
Bet you he'd be pissed off to know
that he's left you in the shit, eh?

01:23:11.395 --> 01:23:13.144
I don't know what you're
talking about, mate.

01:23:13.145 --> 01:23:16.027
Come on, don't waste my time,
mate. It was him who came to me,

01:23:16.028 --> 01:23:18.544
offering to get my product
delivered to your factory.

01:23:18.545 --> 01:23:20.411
That's news to me.

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:22.377
Oh, well, that's
just a minor detail.

01:23:22.378 --> 01:23:25.810
What's a major fuckin' detail
is it never got to me.

01:23:25.811 --> 01:23:27.593
So now it's real simple...

01:23:27.594 --> 01:23:30.310
You either give me my gear
or you give me my money.

01:23:30.311 --> 01:23:32.177
What do you reckon?

01:23:32.178 --> 01:23:36.277
What about you go and get
fucked, we call it even?

01:23:36.278 --> 01:23:37.727
Hmm?

01:23:38.994 --> 01:23:40.560
Fair enough.

01:23:40.561 --> 01:23:42.892
Ha!

01:23:45.227 --> 01:23:47.477
You know, in some
fucked-up countries,

01:23:47.478 --> 01:23:50.227
they'll chop a bloke's hand off for
stealing another bloke's gear.

01:23:50.228 --> 01:23:51.510
Ah!

01:23:54.927 --> 01:23:56.810
That's a silly place to park.

01:23:56.811 --> 01:23:58.776
I wouldn't do that if I was
you, you fuckin' hippie.

01:23:58.777 --> 01:24:00.626
Take a long time to forgive that.

01:24:00.627 --> 01:24:02.925
I guess we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

01:24:03.777 --> 01:24:05.609
Let him go.

01:24:19.677 --> 01:24:21.976
Don't make me ask your mom, Andy.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:29.710
You have to go to the police.

01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:31.743
And say what? That I'm in a feud

01:24:31.744 --> 01:24:33.228
with the local bikie
gang over a drug debt?

01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:34.560
Which is not yours.

01:24:34.561 --> 01:24:36.328
It was delivered to my factory.

01:24:36.329 --> 01:24:37.494
I even signed for it.

01:24:37.495 --> 01:24:39.560
Okay, then call Gordon king.

01:24:39.561 --> 01:24:41.810
His offer is pretty
reasonable considering...

01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:43.244
Considering what?

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:45.211
I do that, then I
become Gordon king.

01:24:45.212 --> 01:24:47.260
You're nothing like him. He
never surfed a day in his life.

01:24:47.261 --> 01:24:49.027
It doesn't matter, Lani!

01:24:49.028 --> 01:24:51.493
We're not selling out.
That's the point.

01:24:51.494 --> 01:24:54.694
Tell her, J.B.

01:24:54.695 --> 01:24:56.127
Tell her.

01:24:56.128 --> 01:24:57.560
<i>She's right.</i>

01:24:57.561 --> 01:25:02.410
Sometimes you got to
exploit the system, yeah,

01:25:02.411 --> 01:25:05.059
<i>or the system's going
to exploit you.</i>

01:25:07.077 --> 01:25:09.510
It's Darwinian, man.

01:25:09.511 --> 01:25:12.744
We adapt, we survive

01:25:12.745 --> 01:25:14.477
and we move on.

01:25:17.961 --> 01:25:21.228
What the fuck are you talking about,
after all we've been through?

01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:24.193
Having come this far?

01:25:41.343 --> 01:25:43.010
<i>Is everything clear?</i>

01:25:43.011 --> 01:25:46.393
Any questions, Kat, feel
free to drop me a line.

01:25:46.394 --> 01:25:51.027
Then sign it and return
it as soon as you can.

01:25:51.028 --> 01:25:53.777
Hello, Andrew.

01:25:53.778 --> 01:25:57.076
You're making a very wise
decision, Mrs. Kelly.

01:26:01.410 --> 01:26:04.143
Mom?

01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:07.210
<i>Hey!</i>

01:26:07.211 --> 01:26:09.693
You really thought I'd
agree to that, did you?

01:26:09.694 --> 01:26:11.793
It's not up to you. The house
is in your mother's name.

01:26:11.794 --> 01:26:13.427
I think you'll find
it's a very fair price.

01:26:13.428 --> 01:26:15.893
What, the exact same amount
we paid for it 12 years ago?

01:26:15.894 --> 01:26:17.693
- The market's been very flat.
- <i>Andy!</i>

01:26:17.694 --> 01:26:20.243
- You thieving prick!
- Andrew, enough!

01:26:22.061 --> 01:26:23.943
Safe travels.

01:26:24.743 --> 01:26:26.960
Andrew, this way we get to pack up

01:26:26.961 --> 01:26:28.527
and start again somewhere new.

01:26:28.528 --> 01:26:30.727
- We're not going anywhere, mom.
- I know about Miller.

01:26:30.728 --> 01:26:32.543
Lani told me. I know
about the whole thing.

01:26:32.544 --> 01:26:34.877
We fought for years to say
that we live here. All right?

01:26:34.878 --> 01:26:38.044
And you're telling me that we're going to
run away with our tail between our legs?

01:26:38.045 --> 01:26:40.193
Without so much as a fight?

01:26:41.493 --> 01:26:44.860
A real fighter knows when to stand
his ground and when to walk away.

01:26:44.861 --> 01:26:48.559
I thought you'd worked
that out by now.

01:26:54.711 --> 01:26:56.927
<i>It'll sort out the bank, it's
gonna take care of Miller.</i>

01:26:56.928 --> 01:26:59.011
Your ankle won't handle it.
Think about it.

01:26:59.012 --> 01:27:01.211
These are pro surfers
from all over the world.

01:27:01.212 --> 01:27:04.244
- You'll be lucky if you even qualify.
- It's $5,000, Lani.

01:27:04.245 --> 01:27:06.060
Which you have zero
chance of winning.

01:27:06.061 --> 01:27:09.710
You think I'm gonna roll over for these
pricks, you've got another thing coming.

01:27:09.711 --> 01:27:11.560
This is real. Miller
is not going away.

01:27:11.561 --> 01:27:13.625
- Exactly!
- Would you stop?

01:27:15.027 --> 01:27:16.260
What?

01:27:16.261 --> 01:27:18.593
You can't fix this on your own.

01:27:18.594 --> 01:27:20.827
Okay? You can't.

01:27:20.828 --> 01:27:22.526
Not this time.

01:27:22.527 --> 01:27:24.760
If Jimmy were here, it might
be a different story.

01:27:24.761 --> 01:27:27.326
Yeah, but Jimmy's not here, is he?

01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:36.959
You know the trouble with
being the last man standing?

01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:41.093
You got no one to share it with.

01:27:46.776 --> 01:27:48.710
<i>Come on, come over here.</i>

01:27:48.711 --> 01:27:50.708
Have a good surf, man.

01:27:52.177 --> 01:27:54.443
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:27:54.444 --> 01:27:56.994
Is this the place to register
for the qualifying events?

01:27:56.995 --> 01:27:58.243
Yeah yeah. What's your name?

01:27:58.244 --> 01:27:59.510
Andrew Kelly.

01:27:59.511 --> 01:28:03.127
Uh, nah, I've got a James Kelly.

01:28:03.128 --> 01:28:05.226
Yeah, that's my brother.

01:28:05.227 --> 01:28:07.127
I just want to compete
in the open qualifiers.

01:28:07.128 --> 01:28:10.710
It's a pro event, so qualifying
heats are invite only.

01:28:10.711 --> 01:28:13.426
- Sorry.
- Price of popularity, I'm afraid.

01:28:13.427 --> 01:28:15.977
Hey, what do you think? Too big?

01:28:15.978 --> 01:28:18.710
She reckons you're not holding an
open qualifying round, Gordon.

01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:21.276
I'm afraid not. Seems
everyone from Sunny down

01:28:21.277 --> 01:28:23.111
wants a crack at the five Gs.

01:28:23.112 --> 01:28:24.843
<i>We are drowning in interest.</i>

01:28:24.844 --> 01:28:26.677
So what difference would
one more make then?

01:28:26.678 --> 01:28:29.176
You scared an unknown
might scoop the pool?

01:28:29.177 --> 01:28:31.809
Jeez.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:37.044
You know what?

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:40.792
It breaks my heart to
see a grown man beg.

01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:46.642
Hey, I can't help you
out there, though.

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:55.059
Good luck.

01:28:57.043 --> 01:28:59.743
Day one of the Ocean
King qualifying round,

01:28:59.744 --> 01:29:01.377
with some heavy waves out the back,

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:04.143
connecting right through
to the inside bank here.

01:29:24.944 --> 01:29:26.794
<i>Let's have a look. Big
set coming through here.</i>

01:29:26.795 --> 01:29:30.177
<i>Turning and paddling hard is the
Seacliffe local, Andrew Kelly.</i>

01:29:30.178 --> 01:29:32.844
<i>Oh, it's a very low take-off...
No, he's made the drum!</i>

01:29:32.845 --> 01:29:34.543
<i>He's crashed right
down through the lip!</i>

01:29:34.544 --> 01:29:37.692
<i>Oh, this is tremendous stuff.
He's looking for the pocket.</i>

01:29:41.911 --> 01:29:44.894
<i>Oh, ho ho ho!</i>

01:29:44.895 --> 01:29:47.176
<i>Heavy wipe-out there
from Andrew Kelly!</i>

01:29:47.177 --> 01:29:49.760
<i>Gee whiz, that's not going
to impress the judges.</i>

01:29:49.761 --> 01:29:52.193
<i>I reckon he's already
trailing on the scoreboard.</i>

01:29:52.194 --> 01:29:54.343
Looks to be a little
out of his depth

01:29:54.344 --> 01:29:57.009
<i>in this building
six-to-eight-foot swell.</i>

01:30:01.061 --> 01:30:02.793
<i>There's only seconds
to go now, folks.</i>

01:30:02.794 --> 01:30:05.476
<i>Last chance for one
lucky surfer to step up</i>

01:30:05.477 --> 01:30:08.375
<i>and score enough points to make
it through to the main event.</i>

01:30:31.193 --> 01:30:33.260
<i>Oh, ho! Top stuff!</i>

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:36.427
<i>Coming from behind to snag
the big wave of the set,</i>

01:30:36.428 --> 01:30:38.627
<i>let's take a look.
Ha ha, he's done it!</i>

01:30:38.628 --> 01:30:41.210
Picking up enough points
on that last ride

01:30:41.211 --> 01:30:43.459
to scrape through to
tomorrow's competition round.

01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:45.726
<i>He's got to be stoked
with that result.</i>

01:30:45.727 --> 01:30:47.810
<i>But with the best surfers
from all over the planet,</i>

01:30:47.811 --> 01:30:49.760
<i>including world #1 Sunny Townsend,</i>

01:30:49.761 --> 01:30:53.027
<i>all lining up for a crack at
the 5,000 bucks first prize,</i>

01:30:53.028 --> 01:30:57.143
<i>well, things just got a lot
tougher for the local lad.</i>

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.359
<i>Thought you said this
place was hard to find.</i>

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:12.442
Not hard enough, obviously.

01:31:15.544 --> 01:31:17.743
It's like the moon up here.

01:31:17.744 --> 01:31:19.977
You must really love
your own company.

01:31:19.978 --> 01:31:21.343
What's not to love?

01:31:26.944 --> 01:31:29.076
Andy's going to surf the pro,

01:31:29.077 --> 01:31:30.761
bad ankle and all.

01:31:30.762 --> 01:31:33.143
- You serious?
- Mm-hmm.

01:31:33.144 --> 01:31:36.526
Figures he stands a shot
at winning the five grand.

01:31:36.527 --> 01:31:40.276
<i>You know, try and get
Miller off his back.</i>

01:31:40.277 --> 01:31:42.010
Oh.

01:31:42.011 --> 01:31:44.243
Good luck to him.

01:31:44.244 --> 01:31:46.592
Yeah, he'll need it.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.192
Seen the forecast?

01:31:50.176 --> 01:31:53.060
Big swell due to arrive
at Seacliffe tomorrow.

01:31:53.061 --> 01:31:55.725
Not sure Andy knows
what's about to hit him.

01:31:57.993 --> 01:31:59.776
<i>Here we are, folks, the day
we've been waiting for,</i>

01:31:59.777 --> 01:32:01.410
<i>day one of the main event.</i>

01:32:01.411 --> 01:32:03.594
<i>Get ready to watch the
very best surfers</i>

01:32:03.595 --> 01:32:06.526
<i>from all over the world,
from Hawaii to Peru</i>

01:32:06.527 --> 01:32:10.110
<i>to the U.S. of A., all going head
to head with Australia's best.</i>

01:32:10.111 --> 01:32:12.594
Surfers crossing here.

01:32:12.595 --> 01:32:15.093
Asshole.

01:32:16.194 --> 01:32:18.725
<i>Hey, come on, mate.
Haven't got all day.</i>

01:32:21.076 --> 01:32:23.810
<i>Believe it or not, for once the
weather bureau's got it right.</i>

01:32:23.811 --> 01:32:25.426
<i>The swell's come up overnight,</i>

01:32:25.427 --> 01:32:27.760
<i>and now it looks like the
sea gods are either smiling</i>

01:32:27.761 --> 01:32:31.544
or they're really pissed off,
depending on your persuasion today.

01:32:31.545 --> 01:32:34.743
<i>So anyway, buckle up,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:32:34.744 --> 01:32:37.109
<i>I've got a feeling things
could get real bumpy.</i>

01:32:38.643 --> 01:32:41.760
Didn't know they had
a seniors' comp'.

01:32:41.761 --> 01:32:43.711
Real announcers and everything.

01:32:43.712 --> 01:32:45.376
How long have I been
away for again?

01:32:45.377 --> 01:32:48.160
Jimmy!

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.777
<i>So here we go... Draw
for the first heat today</i>

01:32:53.778 --> 01:32:57.210
is Harris, Cay, Harvey and Kelly.

01:32:57.211 --> 01:33:00.026
You qualified? Fair dinkum?

01:33:00.027 --> 01:33:02.093
<i>All competitors in heat
one, please make your way</i>

01:33:02.094 --> 01:33:03.860
- <i>to the marshalling area now.</i>
- Gotta go.

01:33:03.861 --> 01:33:05.960
Andy?

01:33:05.961 --> 01:33:08.744
I've been surfing perfect
six-footers for the past six weeks.

01:33:08.745 --> 01:33:10.793
You look like you've
been surfing a desk.

01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:12.726
Entries are closed.
They're not gonna let you.

01:33:12.727 --> 01:33:15.476
<i>I've already spoken to them.</i>

01:33:15.477 --> 01:33:20.075
They'll let him surf, but only if
someone else drops out last minute.

01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:26.059
Look, you dragged us
here from day one,

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.559
kicking and screaming.

01:33:29.543 --> 01:33:33.241
Let someone else carry
the load for a while.

01:33:34.043 --> 01:33:35.976
I've got this, brother.

01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:39.459
Trust me.

01:33:54.143 --> 01:33:55.776
<i>Oh, hold onto your hats, folks.</i>

01:33:55.777 --> 01:33:57.760
<i>It's the real deal out there today.</i>

01:33:57.761 --> 01:33:59.143
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:34:02.377 --> 01:34:04.193
<i>There you have one of
those new kook cords</i>

01:34:04.194 --> 01:34:06.892
<i>the lads are using to hold onto
their boards after a wipe-out.</i>

01:34:06.893 --> 01:34:08.777
Can't see 'em catching on,
though, if you ask me.

01:34:08.778 --> 01:34:12.343
<i>I move like a cat,
charge like a ram</i>

01:34:12.344 --> 01:34:14.227
<i>Sting like a bee</i>

01:34:14.228 --> 01:34:17.859
<i>Babe, I wanna be your man...</i>

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.360
<i>Up riding again in yellow</i>

01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:20.892
<i>is the last-minute
substitution, Jimmy Kelly.</i>

01:34:20.893 --> 01:34:22.276
<i>Come on, Jim!</i>

01:34:22.277 --> 01:34:24.410
<i>Well, it's plain to see</i>

01:34:24.411 --> 01:34:26.727
<i>You were meant for me, yeah</i>

01:34:26.728 --> 01:34:30.909
<i>I'm your boy, your
20th century toy...</i>

01:34:33.393 --> 01:34:35.393
<i>Oh, how about that, folks?!</i>

01:34:35.394 --> 01:34:37.610
<i>Ferocious final ride
from young Kelly.</i>

01:34:37.611 --> 01:34:39.743
- <i>Good stuff!</i>
- Ah!

01:34:39.744 --> 01:34:43.009
- <i>Go, Jimmy!</i>
- That's my boy.

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:45.443
Scorecards are in. You're
not going to believe this.

01:34:45.444 --> 01:34:47.726
Winning his way through
to the big final round

01:34:47.727 --> 01:34:50.059
is the local lad, Jimmy Kelly!

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.009
<i>Let's give it up for Jim.</i>

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.460
<i>It's a shame he's not going to
stick around for the contest.</i>

01:35:05.461 --> 01:35:08.726
<i>He's like a hermit crab...
Wears his house on his back,</i>

01:35:08.727 --> 01:35:11.126
pulls his head in when
he feels bad vibes.

01:35:11.127 --> 01:35:14.092
<i>Hmm, fair enough.</i>

01:35:19.293 --> 01:35:21.793
Would it be okay if I threw
out a blanket apology

01:35:21.794 --> 01:35:24.226
for all the stupid shit
I've said recently?

01:35:29.193 --> 01:35:32.009
Thanks for coming back.

01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:34.176
You still don't get it, do you?

01:35:34.177 --> 01:35:35.276
<i>What?</i>

01:35:35.277 --> 01:35:37.243
God, you're such a dumbass.

01:35:37.244 --> 01:35:39.493
You and Jimmy...

01:35:39.494 --> 01:35:41.643
You're like Yin and Yang.

01:35:41.644 --> 01:35:44.143
One pretty much sucks
without the other.

01:35:44.144 --> 01:35:45.343
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:35:45.344 --> 01:35:46.859
Well, take it however you want.

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:50.108
- <i>I'll take it as a compliment then.</i>
- Fine, do it.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.392
This any use to you?

01:36:11.576 --> 01:36:13.759
You fixed it.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.425
Unreal.

01:36:19.959 --> 01:36:21.693
He'd have liked that.

01:36:26.976 --> 01:36:29.193
- Aww!
- Jim, when you're out there today...

01:36:29.194 --> 01:36:32.343
I already know what you're
gonna say, and I agree.

01:36:32.344 --> 01:36:34.360
"Play it safe, make sure
I get into the final,

01:36:34.361 --> 01:36:36.293
no points for second." All right?

01:36:36.294 --> 01:36:39.309
I was going to say
the exact opposite.

01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:40.976
You're a natural.

01:36:40.977 --> 01:36:42.859
J.B. was right.

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:45.610
Go for it, man. Get into it.

01:36:45.611 --> 01:36:47.243
It's the whole point, right?

01:36:52.243 --> 01:36:55.477
<i>Oh, jeez, it's not for the
faint-hearted out there today.</i>

01:36:55.478 --> 01:36:57.876
<i>The brunt of the big-storm
swell has arrived.</i>

01:36:57.877 --> 01:37:01.442
Mother nature has really turned
it on for the final, folks.

01:37:05.659 --> 01:37:07.393
<i>A minute to go</i>

01:37:07.394 --> 01:37:09.775
and it looks like it's come
down to a two-man tussle

01:37:09.776 --> 01:37:11.826
<i>between Hawaii's Sunny Townsend</i>

01:37:11.827 --> 01:37:14.742
<i>and Jimmy Kelly.</i>

01:37:14.743 --> 01:37:16.193
<i>Now Kelly's only a
few points behind,</i>

01:37:16.194 --> 01:37:18.460
<i>but really looks to be
outclassed by the Hawaiian,</i>

01:37:18.461 --> 01:37:21.859
<i>who seems to be in a league
of his own out there today.</i>

01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:24.109
<i>Come on, Jimmy!</i>

01:37:25.942 --> 01:37:29.108
Come on, Jimmy.
Get inside him, mate.

01:37:30.675 --> 01:37:32.343
<i>Get inside him!</i>

01:37:32.344 --> 01:37:33.742
Sunny's all over him.

01:37:37.326 --> 01:37:38.510
<i>Oh, this is clinical.</i>

01:37:38.511 --> 01:37:40.209
<i>We are watching a master class</i>

01:37:40.210 --> 01:37:42.275
<i>on competition surfing right now.</i>

01:37:45.093 --> 01:37:47.142
<i>Oh, that's unbelievable!</i>

01:37:47.143 --> 01:37:49.293
<i>Sunny's hit the lip
really hard then, people,</i>

01:37:49.294 --> 01:37:51.143
<i>then floated right across the wave.</i>

01:37:51.144 --> 01:37:52.910
<i>That's ground-breaking stuff there</i>

01:37:52.911 --> 01:37:54.759
<i>from the big-wave
specialist from Maui.</i>

01:37:55.777 --> 01:37:58.910
Ha ha! Hey? How good's this bloke?

01:37:58.911 --> 01:38:03.026
<i>Let's see... with 60
seconds left on the clock,</i>

01:38:03.027 --> 01:38:05.443
<i>and trailing the Hawaiian
on the scoreboard,</i>

01:38:05.444 --> 01:38:07.127
<i>it looks like the local
lad's left his run</i>

01:38:07.128 --> 01:38:09.410
<i>just a bit too late, folks.</i>

01:38:09.411 --> 01:38:11.226
Smile, will ya?!

01:38:11.227 --> 01:38:13.076
Get out of here, you lunatic!

01:38:13.077 --> 01:38:14.692
It's too big. You'll get smashed.

01:38:14.693 --> 01:38:17.609
Not today, my man. Not today.

01:38:19.293 --> 01:38:22.091
Here we go... out the back.

01:38:23.127 --> 01:38:25.059
Hold the phone, people.

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:26.842
<i>This thing is not over yet.</i>

01:38:32.377 --> 01:38:34.759
Go, Jimbo. Go, son!

01:38:36.892 --> 01:38:39.075
<i>Come on!</i>

01:39:32.126 --> 01:39:35.064
- What do you think you're doing?
- That's my brother out there.

01:39:41.143 --> 01:39:43.659
He's over there!

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.926
Ah!

01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:36.558
You okay, you mad bastard?

01:40:36.559 --> 01:40:39.625
I blew it, man. I'm so sorry.

01:40:49.361 --> 01:40:53.127
Yeah! Yeah!

01:41:00.343 --> 01:41:02.110
<i>How about this kid?!</i>

01:41:03.977 --> 01:41:05.842
Ocean King, folks!

01:41:05.843 --> 01:41:08.609
Ocean King on an Ocean King board.

01:41:47.892 --> 01:41:50.891
Get off the road, everyone.
Get off the road.

01:41:54.043 --> 01:41:56.774
<i>Okay, come on, get off the road.</i>

01:42:01.710 --> 01:42:03.559
<i>I know, right?</i>

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.493
<i>Make sure you come back to us.</i>

01:42:05.494 --> 01:42:08.327
<i>Oh, wait, wait, don't
forget your wax.</i>

01:42:08.328 --> 01:42:10.160
Thanks so much.

01:42:10.161 --> 01:42:11.959
Where have you been?
I've been trying

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:14.525
- to call you all morning.
- Yeah, we disconnected the phone.

01:42:14.526 --> 01:42:17.143
- Good stuff, mate.
- What is going on here?

01:42:17.144 --> 01:42:19.625
Wait, you guys haven't seen it yet?

01:42:19.626 --> 01:42:21.758
<i>Seen what?</i>

01:42:23.342 --> 01:42:25.093
Front page.

01:42:26.426 --> 01:42:29.991
Oh, Jimmy.

01:42:31.643 --> 01:42:34.726
Jimmy!

01:42:34.727 --> 01:42:38.026
It's been crazy all day.

01:42:38.827 --> 01:42:41.325
Drift Surf Gear.

01:42:41.326 --> 01:42:44.442
Oh, finally, man. The line's been
busy for, like, the last hour.

01:42:44.443 --> 01:42:46.375
Yeah, it's sort of crazy
down here at the moment.

01:42:46.376 --> 01:42:47.608
<i>I imagine.</i>

01:42:47.609 --> 01:42:49.409
T.J. Adleman from the
surf hut in Venice.

01:42:49.410 --> 01:42:51.442
<i>I'm looking at your
photo right now.</i>

01:42:51.443 --> 01:42:53.459
<i>It's a hell of a move, you know
what I'm saying? Hell of a move.</i>

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:57.160
I already had some guys in here this
morning asking after the boards.

01:42:57.161 --> 01:42:58.775
<i>Hoping I'm not too late
to place an order.</i>

01:42:58.776 --> 01:43:01.476
- No, you're right.
- <i>Great, man, great.</i>

01:43:01.477 --> 01:43:03.942
Why don't we start with,
I don't know, say, 15?

01:43:03.943 --> 01:43:05.259
15?

01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.043
Absolutely.

01:43:07.044 --> 01:43:10.210
That's great, man. 15 a month and
then we can take it from there, cool?

01:43:10.211 --> 01:43:13.392
Let me just put you on
to my sales department.

01:43:15.359 --> 01:43:18.358
Uh, Lani Kealoha.

01:43:20.426 --> 01:43:22.074
Grumley?

01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:24.776
I brought the house
contract for you.

01:43:24.777 --> 01:43:26.376
That's terrific, Andrew.

01:43:26.377 --> 01:43:27.808
Yeah.

01:43:33.325 --> 01:43:35.109
Ow.

01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:36.958
Sheree.

01:43:39.926 --> 01:43:42.559
<i>Yep yep, we'll have
some more in next week.</i>

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.509
See you then.

01:43:48.509 --> 01:43:50.574
Hey?

01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:11.542
Looks like a bomb went off.

01:44:11.543 --> 01:44:14.225
Amazing what a little
publicity will do.

01:44:14.226 --> 01:44:17.309
- Yeah.
- Sure you don't want to stick around?

01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:20.476
And become part of the
surfing industrial machine?

01:44:20.477 --> 01:44:24.025
I don't think so.

01:44:28.077 --> 01:44:31.325
Hey, give us a hand.

01:44:33.242 --> 01:44:36.091
Sure.

01:44:37.242 --> 01:44:39.809
Looks like you guys are
off the hook then.

01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:42.143
Well, not completely.

01:44:42.144 --> 01:44:44.143
There's still Miller.

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:45.943
Oh, right, you didn't hear, no.

01:44:45.944 --> 01:44:48.709
See, apparently someone
tipped off the cops.

01:44:48.710 --> 01:44:50.709
And they raided his
joint last night

01:44:50.710 --> 01:44:53.776
and found a sizeable stash
underneath the bed.

01:44:53.777 --> 01:44:55.609
You serious? What, heroin?

01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:59.342
No, it was high-grade
hash from Indonesia.

01:45:00.643 --> 01:45:03.541
I didn't know he was
into that kind of stuff.

01:45:05.292 --> 01:45:07.791
It's all karma, brother.

01:45:08.359 --> 01:45:10.075
Give 'em.

01:45:11.692 --> 01:45:15.093
So I hear they offered you
a spot on the pro tour.

01:45:15.094 --> 01:45:16.659
Yeah, I'm still not sure about it.

01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:19.392
Man, what are you talking about?

01:45:19.393 --> 01:45:21.692
Huh? Go for it.

01:45:21.693 --> 01:45:23.309
Yeah.

01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:27.826
Just bust 'em wide open.

01:45:27.827 --> 01:45:29.976
<i>Begone!</i>

01:45:29.977 --> 01:45:32.077
Where you going now?

01:45:32.078 --> 01:45:34.409
South.

01:45:34.410 --> 01:45:37.308
Maybe north.

01:45:37.309 --> 01:45:39.392
<i>Maybe, I don't know.</i>

01:45:39.393 --> 01:45:42.259
That's the whole trip right
there, isn't it, man?

01:45:44.559 --> 01:45:47.292
See you when I see you.

01:45:47.293 --> 01:45:49.292
Ha.

01:46:11.376 --> 01:46:15.675
<i>And in the morning I'll be waiting</i>

01:46:17.976 --> 01:46:22.058
<i>For your never-ending wave</i>

01:46:24.592 --> 01:46:28.591
<i>For our passage to arise</i>

01:46:31.175 --> 01:46:35.376
<i>But how can I explain?</i>

01:46:35.377 --> 01:46:37.142
<i>Yeah</i>

01:46:37.143 --> 01:46:39.092
<i>You came home</i>

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:43.759
<i>For the endless summer</i>

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.925
<i>On the white</i>

01:46:46.926 --> 01:46:50.259
<i>Saw a different color</i>

01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:52.142
<i>In the street</i>

01:46:53.826 --> 01:46:57.009
<i>Got a secret to repeat</i>

01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:59.108
<i>In my mind</i>

01:47:00.459 --> 01:47:03.391
<i>You're the ephemeral kind</i>

01:47:06.676 --> 01:47:11.808
<i>Now to ever be touched by</i>

01:47:12.809 --> 01:47:17.308
<i>The feasting tendrils of the night</i>

01:47:19.309 --> 01:47:25.759
<i>Now left to ponder your devotions</i>

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:32.442
<i>Now left imagining a time</i>

01:47:32.443 --> 01:47:34.608
<i>You came home</i>

01:47:36.092 --> 01:47:39.242
<i>For the endless summer</i>

01:47:39.243 --> 01:47:41.374
<i>Watch me go</i>

01:47:42.209 --> 01:47:45.675
<i>Paint a famous warrior</i>

01:47:45.676 --> 01:47:47.741
<i>Of the light</i>

01:47:48.842 --> 01:47:52.209
<i>You were the strongest follower</i>

01:47:52.210 --> 01:47:54.508
<i>In my mind</i>

01:47:55.809 --> 01:48:00.574
<i>You are an endless summer</i>

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:06.008
<i>An endless summer in my mind</i>

01:48:09.209 --> 01:48:12.508
<i>An endless summer in my mind</i>

01:48:15.609 --> 01:48:19.308
<i>An endless summer in my mind</i>

01:48:37.442 --> 01:48:39.842
<i>Yeah, I get low</i>

01:48:39.843 --> 01:48:44.175
<i>And black witches hold my hand</i>

01:48:44.176 --> 01:48:46.809
<i>Yeah, I get low</i>

01:48:46.810 --> 01:48:50.742
<i>Feel no one understands</i>

01:48:50.743 --> 01:48:53.342
<i>Now mistakes</i>

01:48:53.343 --> 01:48:57.175
<i>Make mantelpieces bend</i>

01:48:57.176 --> 01:48:59.675
<i>Now black cinders</i>

01:48:59.676 --> 01:49:04.175
<i>Black cinder till the end</i>

01:49:04.176 --> 01:49:06.024
<i>You came home</i>

01:49:07.542 --> 01:49:10.509
<i>For the endless summer</i>

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:12.841
<i>Watch me go</i>

01:49:14.075 --> 01:49:16.975
<i>Paint a different color</i>

01:49:16.976 --> 01:49:19.675
<i>Of my life</i>

01:49:20.542 --> 01:49:23.476
<i>You were the deepest lover</i>

01:49:23.477 --> 01:49:25.741
<i>Stay with me</i>
