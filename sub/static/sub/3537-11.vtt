WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.937
Joe faked his death,
and now he's
started over again.

00:04.939 --> 00:05.871
With new followers?

00:05.873 --> 00:07.473
So these are
the psychos?

00:07.475 --> 00:09.541
These people are
gonna be very
useful to us.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.211
They need guidance,
teaching.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.345
He's found
a new cult.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.348
Prioritize groups that
believe in blood sacrifice.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.484
I have a holy arm
of warriors,

00:18.486 --> 00:21.987
Who are about to
rain merry hell

00:21.989 --> 00:25.657
There can be no redemption
without blood.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.826
No redemption
without blood!

00:27.828 --> 00:29.294
No redemption
without blood!

00:29.296 --> 00:30.696
No redemption
without blood!

00:30.698 --> 00:32.364
No redemption
without blood!

00:32.366 --> 00:34.466
How does lily gray
fit into all this?

00:34.468 --> 00:36.502
She's the female
version of joe,

00:36.504 --> 00:37.369
Just more elusive.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.537
We have her son
in custody,

00:38.539 --> 00:40.172
But he's not talking.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.408
And ryan--
how's he?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.043
It was hard for him,
but he pulled through.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.377
Carrie: I want
the story, ryan,

00:45.379 --> 00:47.046
But I also want
to help you.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.348
You know you can
trust me, right?

00:49.350 --> 00:50.849
I can't do this.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.017
This is not our way.

00:52.019 --> 00:54.053
I don't want anybody
feeling that

00:54.055 --> 00:55.854
They are here
against their will.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.489
Joe said to give you
another chance.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.491
I hope you don't
disappoint him,

00:59.493 --> 01:00.726
But I have a feeling
you  will.

01:00.728 --> 01:07.099
Let the rivers
of blood flow free!

01:07.101 --> 01:11.537
Korban, embrace
your destiny!

01:11.539 --> 01:13.439
[cheering]

01:14.240 --> 01:17.076
Your commitment
to our mission here

01:17.078 --> 01:22.014
At korban
greatly moves me.

01:22.016 --> 01:26.085
Each and every one
of you has far exceeded

01:26.087 --> 01:27.419
My expectations,

01:27.421 --> 01:30.022
But now we must move on
to the next

01:30.024 --> 01:33.225
And perhaps
most crucial part

01:33.227 --> 01:35.260
Of your instruction.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.362
Who would like
the great honor

01:37.364 --> 01:40.599
Of being first?

01:40.601 --> 01:43.535
Can I?

01:43.537 --> 01:44.303
Yes.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.604
[whispers]
angela.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.874
Angela, yes?

01:48.876 --> 01:52.711
Come. Please.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.247
Angela, now
I want you

01:55.249 --> 01:56.882
To close your eyes,

01:56.884 --> 01:59.151
And I want you
to tell me

01:59.153 --> 02:02.788
About the happiest
moment of your life,

02:02.790 --> 02:05.424
Whatever comes to mind.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.326
It was years ago

02:07.328 --> 02:08.560
Before korban.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.895
I went to
the florida keys

02:09.897 --> 02:13.899
With my fiancÃ©...

02:13.901 --> 02:15.434
Before he died.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.236
We were snorkeling,
and we would dive down

02:17.238 --> 02:18.570
Over the coral reef.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.507
The water was
completely clear.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.476
My body felt
so...Light,

02:24.478 --> 02:28.013
And the feeling was
so vivid like I was flying.

02:28.015 --> 02:31.216
It was freedom.

02:32.585 --> 02:35.621
Oh, that's great.
Open your eyes.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.356
That feeling,

02:37.358 --> 02:39.625
That feeling
of total serenity,

02:39.627 --> 02:42.928
Of freedom,

02:42.930 --> 02:46.598
That is the gift
that you can give

02:46.600 --> 02:49.101
To the world.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.275
[whimpering]

02:56.277 --> 02:58.710
Carla lies here
before you.

02:58.712 --> 03:04.716
I want you to give
that gift to carla.

03:04.718 --> 03:08.554
Do you think you
can do that, angela?

03:08.556 --> 03:09.821
I think so.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.556
Ok.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.892
[carla sobbing]

03:13.894 --> 03:15.060
Shh. It's ok.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.696
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.668
Angela, free her.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.970
Save her soul
from this world

03:24.972 --> 03:30.509
And let it fly up
to the most high.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.478
Can you do that?

03:33.480 --> 03:35.581
Yes, I can.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.083
Uh-huh. Yes?

03:40.087 --> 03:44.323
It's going to be
all right, carla.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.225
You're going home.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.894
Home.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.529
I love you, carla.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.165
You can do it, angela.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.339
You can do it, angela.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.340
Do it.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.509
[groaning]

04:05.578 --> 04:06.845
You're not
taking a life.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.282
You are freeing
a soul!

04:10.284 --> 04:11.984
Yes!

04:17.624 --> 04:19.591
Yes.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.364
I did it.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.198
Yes.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.399
I really did it.

04:27.401 --> 04:31.303
That is a beautiful,
beautiful thing.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.006
[angela crying]

04:35.441 --> 04:36.541
Oh. Well done.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.511
[applause continues]

04:47.654 --> 04:50.789
Woman on tv: Today's top story.
As the nationwide manhunt

04:50.791 --> 04:55.494
It's bringing with it a culture
of disturbing behavior.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.095
Joe carroll masks
and t-shirts

04:57.097 --> 05:00.399
Are going on sale
as the nation's fascination

05:00.401 --> 05:02.601
With this serial killer
is reaching

05:02.603 --> 05:05.437
A fanatical obsession.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.638
Woman: We're not
killing anyone.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.407
We're just having
a party.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.976
You know, we're
more of a fan club
than a cult.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.679
It's just a way
to express ourselves,

05:13.681 --> 05:14.680
Be unique.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.814
It's fun.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.783
If you're shocked
by this report,

05:17.785 --> 05:18.617
You are not alone.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.752
The fanaticism created
by joe carroll

05:20.754 --> 05:25.157
Is shocking the country,
and on the--

05:25.658 --> 05:28.460
Ok. First, you're
watching the wrong
news channel.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.095
And, two, can
you believe this?

05:30.097 --> 05:32.698
We're covering a fraternity
cult beer bust tonight.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.499
World we live in.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.268
Good morning.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.541
Newswire broke a report
that lily gray is in europe.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.775
Care to comment?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.110
News to me.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.378
More false reports.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.146
There's been lily gray
sightings

05:48.148 --> 05:50.749
In 12 countries
so far.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.121
You should do that
more often.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.489
It suits you.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.657
What?

05:58.659 --> 06:00.425
Smile.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.396
So I'll see
you tonight?

06:04.398 --> 06:05.664
Can it be late?

06:05.666 --> 06:06.965
Busy day.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.800
Sure.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.437
[knock on door]

06:16.142 --> 06:17.676
Carrie: Morning, mike.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.712
Good morning, carrie.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.416
I'll call you later.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.318
Come on, guys.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.853
Was I interrupting
something?

06:27.855 --> 06:30.355
Not at all.
Coffee?

06:30.357 --> 06:32.557
So following up
on joe's call

06:32.559 --> 06:34.092
And his new holy army,
max and I spent
the morning

06:34.094 --> 06:36.261
Digging through
the meggido project
database.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.330
It's the most comprehensive
listing of cults,

06:38.332 --> 06:39.865
Domestic terrorist
organizations.

06:39.867 --> 06:40.699
Anything?

06:40.701 --> 06:42.200
Well, max stayed behind
to look

06:42.202 --> 06:43.101
At unregistered cults,

06:43.103 --> 06:44.603
But here's
our first pass.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.272
We found 73 cults,
starting with small,
vulnerable ones

06:47.274 --> 06:48.607
Prone to ritualistic
behavior.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.409
They all use some warped
version of religious doctrine,

06:50.411 --> 06:53.779
And they're all within
a day's drive of new york.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.949
Woman on tv: The fbi has
broadened its search

06:57.951 --> 06:59.918
To the west coast
as nationwide tips

06:59.920 --> 07:03.555
About the location
of joe carroll are coming in.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.690
The fbi is investigating...

07:05.692 --> 07:06.858
Claire.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.727
You remember brad daniels
from witsec?

07:08.729 --> 07:12.731
Yeah. Thank you
for coming.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.799
When can I leave?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.767
Claire, a lot of people
went through a lot of work

07:15.769 --> 07:17.869
To make sure that you
and your son are safe.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.305
You need to let
the authorities
handle joe carroll.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.473
I let
the authorities

07:21.475 --> 07:22.707
Handle joe carroll.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.875
I gave up
my entire life,

07:23.877 --> 07:24.976
And my son
still isn't safe,

07:24.978 --> 07:27.145
So now I'd like to
see ryan hardy.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.080
Claire, you realize
leaving witness protection

07:29.082 --> 07:30.615
And going to new york
will compromise

07:30.617 --> 07:31.817
The fbi's investigation.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.785
I know the law.
You can't stop me.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.820
Actually, we can.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.655
Compromising
a federal investigation

07:36.657 --> 07:37.923
Is grounds
for containment.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.958
I am not gonna
reveal I'm alive.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.893
I simply--I want
to see ryan

07:41.895 --> 07:45.230
Because I know a way
I can help him.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.436
We'll need to
accompany you.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.438
Also, I want to move
your so and your mother

07:53.440 --> 07:55.474
To an undisclosed
military base

07:55.476 --> 07:56.908
Until further notice.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.844
You won't even know
where they are.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.379
It's for their safety.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.086
You won't see them again
unless you return

08:08.088 --> 08:10.522
To witness protection.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.527
The man killed
at the restaurant--

08:15.529 --> 08:16.862
Patrick trano--
he served two tours

08:16.864 --> 08:20.131
In pakistan
and disappeared
upon discharge.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.766
His family said
he had some posttrauma.

08:21.768 --> 08:22.934
They had no idea that
he'd joined a cult.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.003
What about lily gray?
Did clarke give you
an update?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.839
Yeah. They initiated
an international
manhunt,

08:27.841 --> 08:29.207
And based
on her resources,

08:29.209 --> 08:30.842
They think she's
probably in a country

08:30.844 --> 08:33.578
Without extradition.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.518
You ok?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.219
How's your family?

08:41.221 --> 08:44.723
They're ok considering.

08:46.492 --> 08:50.028
You're gonna get
through this, mike.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.297
We both are.

08:53.199 --> 08:58.470
How uncharacteristically
optimistic of you, ryan.

08:58.472 --> 09:01.706
Hey. I can be
optimistic.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.409
Sometimes.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.744
Uh-huh.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.146
Is this carrie cooke's
doing?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.749
I know it's not
my business, but I--

09:10.751 --> 09:13.685
Nah. It's cool.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.920
Yeah. I like her.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.589
Uh...

09:17.591 --> 09:20.125
She's not what
I thought.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.397
Ok.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.802
[indistinct chatter]

09:58.230 --> 10:00.065
Aah!

10:00.067 --> 10:00.899
Hey!

10:00.901 --> 10:04.202
[people screaming]

10:25.591 --> 10:27.592
[police radio chatter]

10:27.594 --> 10:28.793
Clarke: 5 dead,
12 injured.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.228
And you're sure
it was carroll?

10:30.230 --> 10:31.963
Yeah. Witnesses report
seeing white masks, knives--

10:31.965 --> 10:34.232
Watch your step--
just like the previous attacks.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.067
They were dropped off
by a van.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.268
They worked their way
through the bakery,

10:37.270 --> 10:38.670
And they exited
the rear.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.105
Is there a message?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.674
The other attacks
came with a message
from joe.

10:42.676 --> 10:46.177
I'm not aware
of any message, no.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.450
Emma: Mandy's
a problem, joe.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.420
Carroll: Yeah. Yeah.
She's been something
of a disappointment.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.355
I was hoping to
strengthen her resolve,

10:57.357 --> 10:59.324
But she's not quite
coming around, is she?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.092
I've heard talk.
People are wondering

11:01.094 --> 11:03.194
Why you didn't put her
in the hole with the others.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.763
Favoritism is frowned
upon here.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.097
It's about unity,
remember?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.366
Let me think
about the best way
to deal with her, yeah?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.702
I think she's
a lost cause.

11:10.704 --> 11:14.606
Duly noted, em,
duly noted.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.207
Sorry.

11:21.547 --> 11:23.014
Joe, can I talk
to you?

11:23.016 --> 11:25.016
Yes, yes, robert,
of course.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.018
What's up?

11:29.889 --> 11:34.292
You know that I have
done everything
that you asked,

11:34.294 --> 11:36.561
But I...

11:36.563 --> 11:37.629
What? What is it,
robert?

11:37.631 --> 11:41.966
What's, uh, what's
bothering you?

11:41.968 --> 11:45.637
Carla was at korban
for 8 years.

11:45.639 --> 11:49.841
She was a kind
and generous soul.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.642
Why her?

11:50.644 --> 11:52.711
Blood sacrifice is--

11:52.713 --> 11:55.914
Is nothing new
to this community, robert.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.882
I know, but...

11:57.884 --> 12:00.018
She was a friend
to me.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.153
She helped me
when I first came
to korban.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.655
She--she stood
beside me.

12:03.657 --> 12:09.094
Yeah. Carla was
a...Very special woman.

12:09.096 --> 12:13.131
That's why she was
chosen to go home.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.502
Do you really
believe that?

12:17.504 --> 12:21.840
Yes. Yes, I do
very much.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.108
Don't--don't you?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.110
Yeah. I--yeah.
I just--it's--

12:25.112 --> 12:26.711
There are some
people here

12:26.713 --> 12:30.181
That are--are
questioning you.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.116
Oh.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.217
They miss micah.

12:32.219 --> 12:36.087
He was always
the one that chose
who went home.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.122
People know
about your past,

12:37.124 --> 12:41.192
And they--they doubt
your sincerity.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.130
But not you, right?

12:45.132 --> 12:48.600
No, no. Joe,
I'm--I'm with you.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.868
You know that.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.603
Yeah.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.806
But what am I
supposed to tell
the others?

12:54.808 --> 12:57.876
You tell them
not to confuse

12:57.878 --> 13:00.145
The man I used to be

13:00.147 --> 13:02.647
With the man
I am now.

13:02.649 --> 13:05.049
You tell them that micah
is still in our hearts

13:05.051 --> 13:10.488
And that we have
great work to do.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.792
You know, we--we have
a special mission
here, robert,

13:13.794 --> 13:17.095
A mission to save
the world.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.297
Salvation is ours

13:19.299 --> 13:24.636
Through the redemption
of others.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.470
Of course.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.238
I'm sorry to even
bring it up...

13:27.240 --> 13:28.740
No, it's--

13:28.742 --> 13:31.976
Carla just hit
me hard, that's all.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.979
I--I'm sorry
I bothered you.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.281
Please. It's fine.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.849
Excuse me.

13:48.127 --> 13:51.095
What was that?

13:51.097 --> 13:54.199
Now we do have
a problem.

13:54.201 --> 13:59.904
Tell me, uh, do you
have any sway with him?

14:01.207 --> 14:02.774
I'm not sure.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.642
Can you find out?

14:04.644 --> 14:08.179
Because he was just
questioning me.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.280
The others trust him.

14:09.282 --> 14:14.052
We have to hold him
close.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.597
[beep beep]

14:28.801 --> 14:30.034
Terri burke?

14:30.036 --> 14:31.369
Yes.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.905
Unh! Unh!

14:58.097 --> 14:59.530
Hey.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.732
You mind if I come in?

15:00.734 --> 15:03.835
No. No. Not at all.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.243
So talk to me.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.214
You can be
totally honest
with me, robert.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.283
What's going on?

15:21.253 --> 15:25.290
I get it, you know?

15:25.292 --> 15:27.191
I do.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.894
I've doubted joe,
too.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.863
He's made mistakes.

15:31.865 --> 15:34.232
That's why he needs
people like us

15:34.234 --> 15:38.369
Does he really believe
we're saving these people?

15:38.371 --> 15:41.205
I know I do

15:41.207 --> 15:43.608
Because I choose
to believe it.

15:43.610 --> 15:47.378
If you believe it,
it is your reality.

15:51.717 --> 15:54.419
I was raised
by a woman who
told me every day

15:54.421 --> 15:58.289
That I was ugly
and sick

15:58.291 --> 16:00.959
And a mistake.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.497
Joe was the first
person to look at me

16:06.499 --> 16:10.335
And tell me that
I was perfect.

16:11.637 --> 16:16.174
He believed in me
until I could
believe in myself.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.011
You have to trust
him, robert.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.512
I want to.

16:21.514 --> 16:25.817
All you have to do
is believe in him.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.251
I do, I do, but--

16:27.253 --> 16:29.253
And me.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.422
Believe in me.

16:33.592 --> 16:36.127
I just want to know
that what I believe in

16:36.129 --> 16:37.929
Is real.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.612
This is real.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.416
Feel it.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.454
Believe it.

17:05.891 --> 17:08.026
Have faith.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.790
Joe?

18:25.537 --> 18:26.571
Man: We got to triage.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.606
Come on, come on,
come on!

18:28.608 --> 18:31.442
The victims
from the bakery attack.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.944
Woman:
We're out of room!

18:32.946 --> 18:35.379
Man: Supplies.
Whatever you got.

18:37.749 --> 18:40.384
Man: More injured
coming in!

19:18.757 --> 19:19.624
Man: You're lucky.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.492
It's just
a superficial wound.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.661
[cell phone vibrates]

19:27.833 --> 19:30.334
[cell phone vibrates]

19:49.655 --> 19:52.123
I had a patient in here.
Do you know where he went?

19:52.125 --> 19:54.525
Uh-uh. Sorry.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.659
They killed two cooks,
wounded two more,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.194
And then they exited
through that backdoor.

20:30.196 --> 20:33.431
Why is joe carroll
taking out a bakery?

20:33.433 --> 20:34.532
Why this bakery?

20:34.534 --> 20:35.700
How many employees
did you say?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.101
5 in all.
1 was killed in front,

20:37.103 --> 20:39.770
2 here, and 2 were
taken to the emergency room.

20:39.772 --> 20:43.574
According to this,
there's only
3 people working.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.243
What hospital
were the victims
taken to?

20:45.245 --> 20:46.744
I don't know.
The nearest one.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.581
I need the hospital
where the victims
were taken.

21:00.525 --> 21:01.626
[beep]

21:01.628 --> 21:04.528
[buzzer]

21:04.530 --> 21:06.530
I have to get
some blood work
for dr. Gibbs.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.599
The authorization.

21:21.913 --> 21:26.050
Man on radio:
They were taken
to manhattan memorial.

21:26.052 --> 21:29.153
That's where luke
is being kept.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.621
This isn't joe.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.957
It's lily gray.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.633
Hmm.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.835
Who are you?

21:46.571 --> 21:48.673
Hello?

21:48.675 --> 21:51.342
Darling?

21:51.344 --> 21:54.979
Please do exactly
as serena tells you.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.483
I'm bringing you home.

22:04.589 --> 22:06.691
They entered
the e.R. As victims.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.925
They're gonna try
to break luke out.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.026
Lock the hospital
down now.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.495
Secure the prisoner
in custody!

22:13.365 --> 22:16.167
[sirens]

22:27.346 --> 22:28.145
Put this on.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.113
What's the plan?

22:29.115 --> 22:30.648
You heard your mother.
I'm gonna get

22:30.650 --> 22:31.849
You out of here.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.884
Stay calm and be patient.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.394
[telephone ringing]

22:43.396 --> 22:45.496
Woman: Hello. Icu.

22:45.498 --> 22:48.799
Marshal keeler,
it's for you.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.702
Marshal keeler.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.538
Keeler: Come again?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.974
Sir, you can't be here.
This is a secured area.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.510
Just push them
where I was told.
I was told here.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.811
Hey, hey stop.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.012
Stay where you are
show me your hands!

23:02.014 --> 23:05.449
Oh, man.
Just doing my job.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.319
Aah!

23:24.503 --> 23:26.504
[whimpers]

23:27.873 --> 23:29.740
Let's go.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.916
[gunshots]

23:40.385 --> 23:42.286
This way.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.053
Now what?

23:43.055 --> 23:44.722
We got an ambulance
downstairs.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.856
We got to go now!

23:45.858 --> 23:49.627
They know we're here.
Got to go, got to go.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.228
You take
the south stairwell.

23:51.230 --> 23:54.632
I may need some cover
getting out.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.537
Second man:
We have a problem.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.971
Hurry up. We were
made too quick.

24:00.973 --> 24:01.872
What the hell happened?

24:01.874 --> 24:04.375
Two minutes out.
We'll be there.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.954
I need agents
at all entrances
and exits.

24:16.956 --> 24:20.558
Let's secure this
ground floor now!

24:32.737 --> 24:34.705
This way.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.784
Ok. Upstairs.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.519
We'll go around.

25:11.142 --> 25:13.978
Please! Help me!
They killed
everybody!

25:13.980 --> 25:16.614
It's all right.
It's all right, ma'am.

25:16.616 --> 25:17.515
Calm down.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.850
The room's empty.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.785
Woman: I heard them.
They're meeting

25:21.787 --> 25:24.221
An ambulance
downstairs.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.223
They're using
an ambulance to escape!

25:26.225 --> 25:30.261
Secure the location.
No ambulances are to leave.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.574
[tires squeal]

25:43.576 --> 25:46.544
[sirens]

25:53.652 --> 25:55.920
Man: Clear that weapon!

26:02.494 --> 26:07.164
Copy that.
The ambulance was empty.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.500
They're still
in the hospital.

26:14.773 --> 26:16.907
Let's go, let's go.

26:22.847 --> 26:25.182
Ryan, that's everybody
that was on the floor.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.917
Hospital administration's
checking I.D.S.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.352
All right. I'm gonna go
floor to floor.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.888
You take the north
stairway, I go south.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.090
Be careful.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.035
Where's serena?

26:45.037 --> 26:48.606
I don't get it.
Why didn't we take
the ambulance like you said?

26:48.608 --> 26:51.475
The fbi and nypd arrived
much earlier

26:51.477 --> 26:52.309
Than expected.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.477
They got on to us
somehow.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.779
They've shut down
the entire perimeter

26:55.781 --> 26:56.614
So what now?

26:56.616 --> 26:57.715
We go with plan "b."

26:57.717 --> 26:58.816
I'll take the kid.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.250
We'll be at the back
entrance of the market

27:00.252 --> 27:02.052
In 20 minutes.
Meet us with the car.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.988
Just follow me.
Do exactly as I say.

27:03.990 --> 27:07.324
Yeah. You guys
keep saying that.

27:11.329 --> 27:12.763
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:12.765 --> 27:13.998
Hey. I was told
to bring all

27:14.000 --> 27:16.734
Hospital personnel
up to 4 for
verification.

27:16.736 --> 27:20.170
All right. Let me
see your I.D.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.006
Thank you.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.448
Ok.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.951
Thank you.
Let me see yours.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.189
Ok.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.192
Ma'am, can you turn
your I.D. Around
so I can see it?

28:15.194 --> 28:19.029
Uh, sorry.
I'm really shaky.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.841
Tell me where
lily gray is.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.143
I don't talk ever.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.546
Where is she,
or you die.

28:35.548 --> 28:36.547
Then I die.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.382
Where is she?!

28:39.217 --> 28:42.453
You're just gonna
have to kill me.

28:43.154 --> 28:45.556
Unh! Aah!

29:08.214 --> 29:12.116
One who speaks of blood
as blessing and hate as love,

29:12.118 --> 29:15.619
One who seduces our troubled
brothers and sisters

29:15.621 --> 29:16.386
With his lies.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.589
I'm speaking to you,
joe carroll.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.057
I'm speaking to you

29:20.059 --> 29:21.792
And all your
crazy followers.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.594
You repent now!

29:23.596 --> 29:24.695
Who is that?

29:24.697 --> 29:27.231
He's a megachurch
evangelist

29:27.233 --> 29:29.533
Who's set his sights
on us.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.702
...Eternal damnation.
You denounce sin!

29:31.704 --> 29:34.304
I expect we're rather
good for his ratings.

29:34.306 --> 29:37.541
How did things go
with robert?

29:37.543 --> 29:40.811
He won't be
a problem.

29:40.813 --> 29:44.148
I knew I could
rely on you, em.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.653
The bible?

29:49.655 --> 29:51.255
If I'm gonna be
the prophet
of salvation,

29:51.257 --> 29:53.791
I need one or two
more buzz words.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.425
This isn't
a joke, joe.

29:55.427 --> 29:58.162
We're running out
of time.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.764
Robert is right.
These people are

30:00.766 --> 30:04.835
Looking to us
for guidance.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.104
So what is the plan?

30:07.106 --> 30:09.139
Same as it's
always been--

30:09.141 --> 30:14.645
To regain our legacy
and live forever in infamy.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.146
That is
a bumper sticker, joe.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.248
That's not an answer.

30:18.250 --> 30:22.753
Oh. Ok. You want
an answer?

30:24.289 --> 30:27.124
You know, it's no accident
that we've ended up

30:27.126 --> 30:29.760
In this place, em.

30:29.762 --> 30:33.997
No. My big mistake
last year was thinking

30:33.999 --> 30:35.599
Way to small.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.769
No. Poe was never
gonna be the answer.

30:38.771 --> 30:41.271
You know, more people
have been killed

30:41.273 --> 30:45.142
In the name of religion
than any other cause on earth,

30:45.144 --> 30:47.711
And yet religion
hides that violence

30:47.713 --> 30:49.346
In the language
of peace,

30:49.348 --> 30:54.885
So we are--we're gonna
show the world the truth.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.721
Religion's not
about love or charity.

30:57.723 --> 31:02.159
It is about blood
and sacrifice.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.694
Here. Look.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.829
"matthew" 10:34.

31:05.831 --> 31:11.335
"jesus said, do not
think I came to bring
peace on earth.

31:11.337 --> 31:16.206
"I did not come
to bring peace
but a sword,

31:16.208 --> 31:20.244
"for I came
to set a man
against his father

31:20.246 --> 31:23.247
And a daughter
against her mother."

31:23.249 --> 31:26.016
And if the, uh,
good preacher
wants a holy war,

31:26.018 --> 31:30.420
Then, by hell,
we'll give him one,

31:30.422 --> 31:35.359
And the whole world
shall bear witness.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.727
Ok, then.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.829
[tv audio muted]

32:18.369 --> 32:20.470
Said, "why the long face?"

32:20.472 --> 32:22.806
[laughter]

32:22.808 --> 32:24.408
You know?

32:24.410 --> 32:28.378
Well, I didn't think
it was anything like that.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.982
The desire was
kind of the strangest...

32:38.389 --> 32:41.558
Strangest thing.

33:16.294 --> 33:17.494
[radio squawks]

33:17.496 --> 33:20.497
Mike: Hey, ryan.
Where are you?

33:20.499 --> 33:22.165
They're heading
to the marketplace

33:22.167 --> 33:23.467
Outside the hospital.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.869
Get units there now!

33:30.041 --> 33:31.842
[clang]

33:51.629 --> 33:55.399
Hello, ryan.
What are you doing here?

33:55.401 --> 33:56.166
Get on the ground.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.701
It's good to see
you, too.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.904
Aw, come on. This ground
is filthy, man.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.906
Come on.

34:06.344 --> 34:08.078
Down on your knees.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.346
Down on
your knees!

34:09.348 --> 34:13.050
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.252
Hey!

34:15.254 --> 34:17.320
What took you
so long?

34:19.390 --> 34:21.491
Down on your knees.

34:23.561 --> 34:26.430
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

34:26.432 --> 34:27.664
Put these on.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.733
Come on!

34:29.735 --> 34:31.501
By now, nypd
and the fbi

34:31.503 --> 34:34.504
Have cordoned off
a 3-block radius
around the hospital,

34:34.506 --> 34:36.506
So there's no way out,

34:36.508 --> 34:39.376
But I could help you.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.411
All I want is luke.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.448
Not with the kind
of money these guys
are making.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.916
Don't be stupid, ryan.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.018
They're paid killers.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.252
You can't possibly
compete.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.989
Ok. So how are you
getting out?

34:53.758 --> 34:55.292
I mean, they've
already started

34:55.294 --> 34:57.961
A person-by-person search.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.129
This is over, fellas.

34:59.131 --> 35:01.064
He's got a point.
How are we getting
out of here?

35:01.066 --> 35:02.099
Market's upstairs.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.600
We're gonna walk
out of here.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.569
Murph's waiting
with a car.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.436
[grunting]

35:06.438 --> 35:08.138
Aah!

35:12.410 --> 35:14.311
[gunshot]

35:45.476 --> 35:47.310
This is the phone
they used

35:47.312 --> 35:48.245
To contact
lily gray.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.479
Have cyber forensics
look into it.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.680
Anything on
the ground search?

35:50.682 --> 35:52.949
We got every available
agent and officer

35:52.951 --> 35:57.988
But he could be anywhere
by now, ryan.

36:00.458 --> 36:02.959
Carrie: Ryan!

36:02.961 --> 36:04.761
Let her through.

36:12.537 --> 36:14.538
Are you ok?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.406
Yeah.

36:17.775 --> 36:21.111
I heard you were
a hero again today.

36:21.113 --> 36:22.379
You need to stop
doing that.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.947
It's very stressful.

36:23.949 --> 36:26.216
No hero, not today.

36:28.619 --> 36:31.354
I'm going on air.
I have to go,

36:31.356 --> 36:34.524
But dinner later?

36:34.526 --> 36:36.726
Yeah, sure.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.536
Carrie: The fbi has few leads

36:46.538 --> 36:48.238
As to where lily and her sons
may be hiding

36:48.240 --> 36:50.407
As this bizarre
nightmare continues.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.542
[knock on door]

36:56.647 --> 36:58.715
Luke.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.651
[crying]

37:01.653 --> 37:04.354
Mark.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.556
Luke.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.592
I missed you, mark.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.953
It's good to see
you, little brother.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.525
Mom.

37:43.728 --> 37:47.264
[lily crying]

37:47.266 --> 37:53.270
Oh, baby. I've
been so worried.

37:53.272 --> 37:57.240
Are you ok?
Are you hurt?

37:57.242 --> 37:58.642
I will kill them all.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.810
I'm fine, mom.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.713
I'm just happy
to be back.

38:17.561 --> 38:18.995
Carrie: Police sources
have confirmed

38:18.997 --> 38:19.996
That today's violence

38:19.998 --> 38:21.665
Was not the work
of joe carroll.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.967
Instead, lily gray has
taken center stage

38:23.969 --> 38:26.336
By impersonating
carroll and his followers

38:26.338 --> 38:28.638
In order to free
her imprisoned son.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.742
You clever, little viper.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.812
Oh, we'll show her.

38:49.360 --> 38:52.162
Look at the resources
this woman has.

38:52.164 --> 38:55.699
She busted into
a government-secured hospital.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.635
How do you go up
against somebody like that?

38:58.637 --> 39:00.503
She's more calculated
than joe

39:00.505 --> 39:01.771
With so little regard
for human life

39:01.773 --> 39:05.875
That she would seek out
a man's father and kill him.

39:09.313 --> 39:12.349
I don't understand it.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.651
I try,
but I don't.

39:14.653 --> 39:17.554
It can't be
understood.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.794
We're gonna find
them, mike.

39:24.796 --> 39:28.298
We're gonna
find lily gray
and joe carroll.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.367
Yeah?

39:30.369 --> 39:31.801
I don't see it.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.536
Well, I do.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.406
Optimism.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.742
Remember? Hope?

39:38.744 --> 39:41.845
And then after
all this is over,

39:41.847 --> 39:43.980
You and me...

39:43.982 --> 39:46.583
We're gonna go
have a life.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.386
You know why?

39:49.388 --> 39:52.122
The universe
owes us.

39:53.657 --> 39:56.092
You understand that?

39:57.328 --> 39:59.662
Good. Let's get
the hell out of here.

we're out of place âª

You must be
freezing.

You need a ride?

40:18.884 --> 40:19.616
Yeah.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.519
âª send everyone spinning

40:22.521 --> 40:25.121
Thank you.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.189
Do you have a phone?

40:26.191 --> 40:27.857
I need to make a call.

is that you?

40:51.716 --> 40:54.717
It's mandy.
I got your number

40:54.719 --> 40:58.488
From the classifieds.

40:58.490 --> 41:02.759
Please. Is it you?

41:02.761 --> 41:04.627
Just left word
for max.

She's been calling
me all day,
freaking out.

Yeah. She missed
a big day.

Ryan, ryan.
Hey, hey, hey.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.416
I'm sorry.
I can explain this.
