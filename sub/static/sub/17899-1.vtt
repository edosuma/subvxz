01:29.965 --> 01:31.967
I'm pregnant.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.494
Good.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.629
That's real good.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.675
There it goes.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.765
Whoo! Whoo!

03:00.931 --> 03:03.730
Yes. Timing's still off 'bout two degrees.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.190
Looked fine to me. What you think?

03:07.270 --> 03:08.817
I think we won.

03:12.818 --> 03:16.322
That's fine right there. Now, come on.
Come on, now. Come on.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.282
Now that's a fast car you fellas got.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.118
And it's mighty fine of you
to let us boys race with y'all.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.587
Whoo!

04:00.365 --> 04:01.453
Get your hands out there, come on.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.001
Come on, Garnet, come on.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.837
Get ready to dance with old Virgil.
Come on.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.195
Damn, Richard. Slow down.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.708
- All right now.
- Where you going?

05:08.767 --> 05:11.520
What you think? Do you like it?

05:15.398 --> 05:16.570
Like what?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.911
This spot. Right here.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.662
This field?

05:25.742 --> 05:26.914
Yeah.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.250
This field not a half a mile from my house
I've been knowing all my life?

05:33.708 --> 05:36.507
Yeah, yeah.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.928
Yes. I like it.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.189
I'm gonna put the kitchen back.
Right back here.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.945
Richard, stop this!

05:57.858 --> 05:59.781
I don't know what you're saying.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.709
I bought it.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.622
This whole acre.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.462
I'm gonna build you a house.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.136
Right here.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.854
Our house.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.325
Mildred?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.333
Yes?

06:52.662 --> 06:54.005
Would you marry me?

07:12.223 --> 07:14.100
Garnet, come.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.648
He said he'd bought the whole acre for me.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.114
And then he asked me to marry him.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.203
- No he didn't!
- Yes.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.205
- Right out in the field?
- Uh-huh.

07:27.364 --> 07:30.208
Oh, Lord, that man might be crazy.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.124
Well, when you gonna do it?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.046
He didn't say.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.499
Soon, though.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.794
Before the baby comes.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.341
He gonna take my sister from me?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.684
No.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.222
We'll be right down the road.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.002
Everything looks fine.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.342
- Thank you, Miss Lola. We'll see you soon.
- We'll be here.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.674
Hey, now.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.853
- Hey, Momma.
- They're out back.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.946
- How we doing?
- Hmm.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.947
Get that board and get up under there.
See if you can get that collector loose.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.013
So I'm gonna take Mildred
up to D.C. to get married.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.314
So, you sure about that?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.488
Yeah.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.330
And you need a witness?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.160
No.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.743
I'm gonna ask her dad
to come up there with us.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.293
Rich is gonna take Mildred
up to D.C. to get married.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.046
String Bean?

09:44.709 --> 09:48.009
Don't make no damn sense.
Now, you'd be fine living in the house.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.799
No wife, just fine.
You don't need no wife.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.260
Well, now, she gonna be your girl.
Why people wanna get married?

09:53.343 --> 09:54.469
Don't make no sense, man.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.186
You think they'll see us today?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.231
Yeah. I called up there.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.402
Seem like a long drive to me.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.331
Thanks for coming, Jake.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.163
Daddy, what's the city like?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.047
It's fine.

10:39.222 --> 10:43.147
Marriage is an institution
of the highest importance.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.313
And it's made honorable
by faithful couples

10:46.396 --> 10:49.400
who are committed to each other for life.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.117
Do you have the ring?

10:58.700 --> 11:03.080
By the power vested in me
by the District of Columbia,

11:03.496 --> 11:06.591
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.599
I may not forgive him.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.806
Come on, now.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.724
You lucky if I forgive you.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.058
No reason to go all the way up there
for this and not take us.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.271
We took Daddy.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.649
Like that means a thing.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.445
Richard said there would be less
red tape in Washington. That's all.

11:33.776 --> 11:37.451
You can stop looking at it,
String Bean, you know it's purdy.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.100
I'm turning in.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.851
What you think 'bout
a bedroom in the back?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.399
I'll like it however you make it.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.330
I'll be in there soon.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.200
Mmm-hmm.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.874
I thought something like this.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.414
Hey, Momma.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.082
Sheriff's Deputy came by looking for you.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.333
What did he want?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.752
Wanted to find you.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.719
Hmm.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.263
Did you tell him where I was?

14:03.926 --> 14:05.769
I didn't have nothing to tell him.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.668
Like me raising a barn, but, you know...

14:34.123 --> 14:37.377
Thinking the kind of fuel in that car,
that was different.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.882
- That car was great.
- Applesauce good.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.682
But, you know...

14:45.301 --> 14:47.303
What you like, Rich, Ford or Chevy?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.646
Eh, don't make much difference.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.016
But which one faster?

14:52.100 --> 14:53.352
That depend on who built it.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.560
That's what I said.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.358
How much money you win with that car?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.402
Boy, why you're asking
him about his money?

14:59.482 --> 15:01.155
He doesn't have to answer me.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.612
How many races you won, Rich?

15:03.694 --> 15:04.695
Oh.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.373
Uh...

15:14.330 --> 15:15.832
A lot.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.836
You need my hand, you need
my hand, too? Count on this one.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.265
I didn't think he was gonna stop.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.094
I wanna know, you know?

15:28.177 --> 15:29.394
Ask that question...

16:40.291 --> 16:41.712
In here!

16:41.792 --> 16:43.920
What you doing in that bed, boy?

16:44.670 --> 16:47.264
- Richard?
- What're you doing in bed with that woman?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.218
I'm his wife.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.601
That's no good here.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.857
Get your pants on, boy.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.777
You get out of that bed.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.617
Get out of that bed!

17:11.571 --> 17:12.789
All right.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.414
Come on.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.304
All right.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.530
She goes in there.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.076
It's all right.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.665
- Come on!
- It's okay.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.213
It's okay.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.590
Richard Loving?

18:51.672 --> 18:52.673
Yeah.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.599
You made bail.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.806
Bean?

19:01.432 --> 19:02.558
Bean?

19:03.643 --> 19:04.644
Richard?

19:08.856 --> 19:09.857
Go on down.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.988
- What about her?
- Just you.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.321
What do you mean? Wait, wait. Wait!

19:15.154 --> 19:16.747
Don't pull me again.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.493
- Come on now.
- That's not right.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.037
Bean.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.339
Richard?

19:26.999 --> 19:29.878
- It ain't right now!
- Come on!

19:29.960 --> 19:31.678
It ain't right!

19:56.445 --> 19:58.288
Sign at the bottom.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.876
What about my wife?

20:02.159 --> 20:04.412
You'll have to talk to the Judge
about that on Monday.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.415
Monday?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.032
That's good.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.241
Okay. Just rest. Just rest.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.538
Richard!

20:42.491 --> 20:43.954
- Richard!
- Yeah?

20:44.034 --> 20:46.207
Bring me that fresh water
and take this one out.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.504
Okay.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.207
Bear down.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.343
Bear down.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.677
- Here, Mom.
- Leave that down.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.552
Good. Good.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.134
Wait. Wait.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.843
What you gonna do?

21:41.425 --> 21:43.302
How did they know to come get us?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.394
Somebody talked.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.297
Hey!

22:57.835 --> 22:58.836
Hey!

23:02.798 --> 23:06.098
We told you to come back
on Monday and talk to the Judge.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.891
I ain't gonna let her
stay there till Monday.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.098
- It's not right.
- Talk to the Judge.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.312
You're not allowed to bail her out.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.696
- I'll get a lawyer.
- You can.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.500
Hey, boy.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.001
Come on.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.188
Sit down.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.828
You back here trying to bail her out?

24:18.624 --> 24:21.127
You know they aren't gonna
let her out to you?

24:22.836 --> 24:25.134
You best send some of
her people up here to get her,

24:25.214 --> 24:27.057
because they won't let her out to you.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.346
- But, she's pregnant.
- Shut your mouth about that.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.308
I'll throw your ass back in there
for that. You know better.

24:38.852 --> 24:39.853
It's just not...

24:40.562 --> 24:41.779
What's that?

24:45.526 --> 24:47.449
You do know better, don't you?

24:50.406 --> 24:51.578
Nah, maybe you don't.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.419
Your daddy worked for a nigger, didn't he?

24:59.623 --> 25:00.920
Running timber?

25:04.753 --> 25:06.300
I'm sorry for you.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.007
No, I really am.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.763
All you over there in Central Point
don't know up from down.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.431
All mixed up.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.683
Part Cherokee,

25:14.596 --> 25:16.143
Rappahannock,

25:16.223 --> 25:18.021
part niggra, part white.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.437
Blood don't know what it wants to be.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.992
You just got born in
the wrong place, is all.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.285
I see you got to thinking it was fine.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.369
You might think people
around here wouldn't care.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.167
Hell, maybe they wouldn't,
if your dumb country ass

25:43.250 --> 25:45.047
hadn't gone off
and married her, but not me.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.128
You hear me?

25:50.090 --> 25:51.262
That's God's law.

25:52.426 --> 25:55.145
He made a sparrow a sparrow
and a robin a robin.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.439
They're different for a reason.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.022
No.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.152
No.

26:14.782 --> 26:15.783
You go on now.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.993
Get on home.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.462
Send some of her people
up here on Monday to get her.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.928
I see you trying to bail her out
again, I'll arrest you.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.504
I should put you in with her tonight.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.779
Your daddy posted your bail.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.387
It's all right, Bean.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.768
It's all right.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.268
Where's Richard?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.513
He moved his things out.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.936
Said they'd arrest y'all again,
if they catch him here with you.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.285
Now, come on. Come on here.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.665
Come on.

30:38.545 --> 30:39.637
Bean?

30:41.256 --> 30:43.600
Hey. It's okay.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.969
Oh, I got you.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.691
You okay?

30:55.771 --> 30:57.444
They hurt you?

30:58.023 --> 30:59.024
No.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.113
I'm just scared.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.205
They said I couldn't see you.

31:09.743 --> 31:10.744
I know.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.503
What are we gonna do?

31:16.583 --> 31:17.800
I got a lawyer.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.471
They say he's the best in the county.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.807
He gonna get it all straightened out.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.555
- I don't know.
- It's fine.

31:29.638 --> 31:34.067
All we gotta do is just keep
to ourselves for a while.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.649
And this will blow over.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.606
Yeah?

31:57.124 --> 31:58.171
I better go.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.016
Better go.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.387
We'll walk over there in a minute.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.971
But I met with the Judge this morning,

32:50.051 --> 32:52.679
and I worked out a deal
I think is pretty fair.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.810
Judge Bazile is a friend.

32:55.599 --> 32:59.069
But he is not a fan
of your particular situation.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.901
If you all plead guilty,

33:02.481 --> 33:05.360
the Judge is willing
to suspend any prison time.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.281
Hmm.

33:15.660 --> 33:16.661
We'll do it.

33:17.245 --> 33:21.082
Now, in exchange for suspending
the jail time, you and your wife,

33:21.875 --> 33:24.924
unless you decide to
dissolve the marriage,

33:26.087 --> 33:27.760
will be forced to leave the state.

33:31.218 --> 33:32.470
Leave the state?

33:33.637 --> 33:35.264
What does that mean?

33:35.347 --> 33:36.974
It's exactly what it sounds like.

33:37.766 --> 33:41.189
You two are not allowed to be
in the state at the same time,

33:41.269 --> 33:43.363
and certainly, aren't allowed
to be here together.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.450
For how long? How long will that last?

33:49.569 --> 33:50.570
Twenty-five years.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.580
That can't be right.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.829
Look, you got a year
in state penitentiary,

33:58.912 --> 34:01.710
which, I remind you, could have been
up to five years at the maximum,

34:01.790 --> 34:05.460
you got a year in prison on one hand,
and leaving the state on the other.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.138
That's an easy choice.

34:23.061 --> 34:27.485
Try not to talk unless he directly
asks you a question, which he won't.

34:27.774 --> 34:30.447
Just like we talked about,
he'll ask what you plead,

34:30.527 --> 34:32.996
you say guilty, and this will be
over quick enough.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.034
"...the said Richard Perry Loving,

34:38.326 --> 34:42.248
"being a white person,
and the said Mildred Dolores Jeter,

34:42.330 --> 34:46.087
"being a colored person,
did unlawfully and feloniously,

34:46.167 --> 34:49.920
"go out of the state of Virginia,
for the purpose of being married

34:50.005 --> 34:54.217
"in the District of Columbia,
on June 2nd, 1958,

34:54.759 --> 34:56.598
"and afterwards returned to,

34:56.678 --> 34:59.392
"and resided in the County of Caroline,

34:59.472 --> 35:03.438
"State of Virginia,
cohabitating as man and wife,

35:03.518 --> 35:06.488
"against the peace and dignity
of the Commonwealth."

35:08.690 --> 35:09.862
How do you plead?

35:14.154 --> 35:15.155
Guilty.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.284
Guilty.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.458
The court does accept the plea of guilty,

35:23.163 --> 35:27.384
and fixed the punishment
of both accused at one year in jail.

35:29.711 --> 35:34.675
The court does suspend said sentence
for the period of 25 years,

35:34.758 --> 35:36.721
upon the provision that both the accused

35:36.801 --> 35:39.395
leave Caroline County
and the State of Virginia at once.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.808
And do not return together
at the same time

35:42.891 --> 35:46.733
to said county and state
for a period of 25 years.

35:48.938 --> 35:50.485
Do either of you have anything to say?

35:52.567 --> 35:53.568
No, sir.

35:55.403 --> 35:56.404
No, sir.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.825
You are released from custody.
Settle your court costs with clerk.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.418
Thank you, Your Honor.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.043
It's 36 dollars

36:07.123 --> 36:09.342
and 29 cents apiece.

36:25.392 --> 36:28.271
That's a number in Washington
for Nancy's brother Alex.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.610
His wife Laura's there most days.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.282
If you need to get us, just call.

36:36.945 --> 36:37.946
Okay.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.082
Daddy?

36:53.128 --> 36:54.129
You okay?

37:06.015 --> 37:08.484
You knew what you
was doing taking her up there!

37:09.728 --> 37:11.321
You had no right for that!

37:28.079 --> 37:29.080
Bean?

40:13.703 --> 40:14.704
How you all doing?

40:15.038 --> 40:16.335
We're fine.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.417
Thank you for taking us.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.544
We've got plenty of room.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.921
- You remember Richard?
- Yes.

40:23.922 --> 40:24.968
Thank you.

40:25.048 --> 40:26.470
No. Glad to have you.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.223
Come on in. Let me show you the house.

40:47.487 --> 40:50.115
Yeah, they live, like, what,
two blocks over there, right?

40:50.198 --> 40:51.450
I know them.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.410
Okay.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.062
I'll be back by dinner.

43:12.548 --> 43:14.926
If the vehicle goes aloft
at too step an angle,

43:15.009 --> 43:17.557
its velocity is cut by 800 feet a second.

43:17.637 --> 43:20.351
Working more directly
against gravity than planned.

43:20.431 --> 43:24.939
Reaching over 23,000 miles an hour,
it carries to nearly 80,000 miles.

43:25.019 --> 43:27.316
Thirty times as far as ever before...

43:27.396 --> 43:28.568
Another moon shot is...

43:52.130 --> 43:53.131
What can I do?

43:56.634 --> 43:57.635
Nothing.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.138
Bean.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.101
It's just...

44:10.356 --> 44:13.568
I always thought your mother
would be the woman to deliver the baby.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.370
Damn it.

44:32.670 --> 44:33.717
Okay.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.515
Okay.

48:07.802 --> 48:09.554
Hey, Momma.

48:09.637 --> 48:11.605
Put some wood in the stove.

48:32.118 --> 48:33.620
Thank you for doing this.

48:35.955 --> 48:37.002
All right.

48:47.383 --> 48:49.306
All right, String Bean, it's on you now.

48:53.055 --> 48:54.898
- Yes, it is.
- Drink this.

49:11.657 --> 49:12.658
Rich!

49:15.035 --> 49:16.036
Rich!

49:20.875 --> 49:22.969
Her water broke.

49:29.216 --> 49:31.435
Okay. Take a breath. Take a breath.

49:35.097 --> 49:36.565
Breathe.

49:39.310 --> 49:40.778
Okay. Bear down.

49:41.312 --> 49:42.564
Bear down hard.

50:04.710 --> 50:05.962
Thank you, Momma.

50:10.466 --> 50:12.764
You never should have married that girl.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.188
Well, I thought you liked her.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.106
I like a lot of people.

50:23.270 --> 50:26.023
That doesn't mean you should have
gone and done what you did.

50:27.650 --> 50:29.072
You knew better.

50:46.669 --> 50:48.137
Sidney.

50:49.463 --> 50:50.931
Hi, Sidney.

50:55.135 --> 50:56.478
Sidney.

51:42.266 --> 51:43.609
Call the lawyer.

52:19.053 --> 52:20.726
Tell that woman to come out here.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.066
She ain't here.

52:30.397 --> 52:31.610
She left.

52:31.690 --> 52:34.284
Boy, I will split your
head into white meat,

52:35.944 --> 52:38.072
and go arrest every soul in that house.

52:43.118 --> 52:44.665
I won't ask you again.

53:05.849 --> 53:06.850
No.

54:18.046 --> 54:19.343
You are in luck.

54:20.507 --> 54:22.180
The Judge is in today.

54:23.927 --> 54:25.304
You'll go straight there.

54:31.268 --> 54:35.943
For violation of your parole,
you are ordered to post a $200 bond,

54:36.982 --> 54:38.696
and appear before this court...

54:38.776 --> 54:39.902
In the next...

54:47.701 --> 54:48.748
Yes, Frank?

54:50.037 --> 54:53.041
We ask for leniency.

54:53.957 --> 54:57.211
I incorrectly told the Lovings
it was fine for them to return home

54:57.294 --> 54:58.465
for the birth of their child.

54:58.545 --> 55:01.970
It... It was my mistake.

55:08.764 --> 55:10.311
Your Honor, I think...

55:22.402 --> 55:23.528
Fine.

55:45.050 --> 55:46.222
Thank you.

55:49.304 --> 55:50.681
Don't come back here again.

55:52.057 --> 55:53.559
You do and you go to prison.

55:54.977 --> 55:56.524
This doesn't happen a second time.

57:23.357 --> 57:26.031
Sidney, Donald, come on down.

57:27.778 --> 57:28.950
Hey!

57:31.073 --> 57:32.165
Okay.

57:33.325 --> 57:35.043
Okay.

57:40.707 --> 57:42.050
Come on in.

57:47.631 --> 57:49.008
You go.

57:49.091 --> 57:50.304
Hi, pretty girl.

57:53.512 --> 57:56.436
Your cousin, Gerald and Davis, are fine,

57:56.556 --> 57:59.396
and Sue and Terry send their love.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.695
They just had a little girl, too.

58:02.354 --> 58:04.818
- Really?
- Their second.

58:04.898 --> 58:05.899
Hmm.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.407
Sidney, don't jump in the house.

58:12.072 --> 58:13.494
They're big.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.289
Yes.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.876
I hate it for them.

58:22.916 --> 58:23.917
It's like they're caged.

58:27.129 --> 58:29.223
Not even any grass for them to run in.

58:32.217 --> 58:33.343
And Daddy?

58:33.927 --> 58:37.227
He's fine. Stays up in that
chair more than in the field.

58:37.931 --> 58:40.228
I told Momma if he don't start
getting some work done,

58:40.308 --> 58:42.856
Mr. Banks liable to find
someone else for it.

58:42.936 --> 58:45.651
Clay said he'd have to stay
with me until after the party.

59:13.508 --> 59:17.388
- Good. How are you doing?
- Where is that piece?

59:18.805 --> 59:20.307
How was your sister?

59:21.308 --> 59:23.527
- I need one piece.
- She's fine.

59:29.941 --> 59:33.240
- I almost have it.
- Yeah? You wanna show me?

59:33.320 --> 59:36.368
The long awaited march
for jobs and freedom

59:36.448 --> 59:38.450
on Washington D.C., has started

59:38.533 --> 59:42.457
and it's about half of the
100, 000 estimated crowd

59:42.537 --> 59:46.086
headed off down Constitution Avenue
toward the Lincoln Memorial

59:46.166 --> 59:48.255
which is where we're seated now.

59:48.335 --> 59:50.713
It is here that the climax of the march...

59:50.796 --> 59:53.760
You boys stop that wrestling.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.934
Come and help Miss Laura
with her groceries.

59:56.384 --> 59:59.684
...coming in around the plaza
surrounding Lincoln Memorial.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.058
They say over 100,000 people are there.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:07.567
...is standing by along the parade
route at 17th and Constitution.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:08.855
Can you imagine?

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.613
Might as well be half way
around the world.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.070
What?

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:17.535
Nothing.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.372
You know what you need to do?

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:23.578
What?

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.123
You need to write Bobby Kennedy.

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:28.712
I'm serious.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:31.420
I mean, that's what they up there for.

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:33.717
All this talk of civil rights.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.594
You need to get you some civil rights.

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:37.971
...engaged in demonstrations before.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.891
In the background, you can hear
some of the young people shouting.

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:44.687
"Freedom, freedom now."

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:52.334
Mmm.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:00.175
- They in bed?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.345
I'm sorry I missed them.

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:06.768
They ask for me?

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.145
Peggy did,

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.443
but she went down fine.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.402
Will you get Saturday off?

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.365
I hope so.

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:39.593
Sidney, get up
and strip those sheets for me.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.347
My turn, my turn, my turn! My turn.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:45.182
Don, make sure your sister gets a turn.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.264
My turn, my turn, my turn.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.062
Byrd residence.

01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:56.357
Hello, I'm calling to speak
to Mildred Loving.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.946
This is she.

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.452
Hello, Mrs. Loving,
my name is Bernard Cohen,

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:08.330
I'm the lawyer that was referred
to you by the ACLU.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.412
Are you familiar?

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.209
I'm sorry. No.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:15.543
You wrote a letter to Attorney
General Kennedy, is that right?

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:18.757
Yes.

01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:21.301
He was not able to help you
with your particular case,

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:24.134
and sent your letter
to the American Civil Liberties Union.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:27.015
The ACLU contacted me,
I'm a lawyer in Virginia,

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.893
and we would like to
help you with your case.

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.313
I see.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:36.818
- Momma! Momma!
- Don, baby, hush.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:41.364
Would it be possible for you
and your husband to meet with me?

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:48.041
I would have to check with my husband.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.498
Okay. I'm based in Alexandria,

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.457
but I have an office in D.C.
If that is a concern.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:59.589
Well, as I said in my letter,
we really can't afford a lawyer.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:02.673
No, ma'am.
The ACLU will take care of any fees.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:11.231
Mrs. Loving? Are you there?

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:17.065
- Yes, we'll see you.
- Wonderful.

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:20.193
I'll have my secretary
call you back to set up a time.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:22.275
Nice speaking with you, Mrs. Loving.

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:36.749
Come here, baby.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.003
I got a call from a lawyer today.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:46.216
- A lawyer?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:49.303
From the American Civil Liberties Union.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.229
Robert Kennedy told him to call us.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:54.190
Go help your sister brush her teeth.

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.694
They wanna help with our case.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:02.191
Well, we can't afford a lawyer.

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:03.695
He said they wouldn't charge us.

01:05:06.194 --> 01:05:08.867
I'm gonna go see him on Thursday.

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:10.199
His name is Cohen.

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:35.518
Hello.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.395
I'm Bernard Cohen. I'm in from Richmond.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.773
I talked to Jim about using
his office for a few hours.

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:41.105
Yes, Mr. Cohen, do you know it?

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:42.530
- Down the hall?
- Yes.

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.401
My clients are Mr. and Mrs. Loving.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:47.822
Could you send them down when they arrive?

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.028
Certainly.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.033
Come in.

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:35.995
- Mrs. Loving.
- Hello.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:37.372
Please, have a seat.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:41.047
Bernard Cohen. It's a pleasure.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:46.761
Thank you for coming in today.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:52.303
So, as we discussed on the phone,
the ACLU would like to take on your case.

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:55.306
I was actually a charter member
of the ACLU in Virginia,

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:57.309
which is why they assigned me to you.

01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:01.109
The bottom line is,
we wanna get you all some relief.

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:06.234
That's very generous. Thank you.

01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:10.069
Now, the first step is to appeal
the sentence in Caroline County.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:12.988
That will be our fastest
route to Federal Court.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:14.744
- The problem is...
- Federal Court?

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:18.953
Yes, the goal is to try to get
the Federal Court to hear the case...

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:21.834
Excuse me, I don't understand...
Federal Court.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.586
I see it as the best route...

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:27.215
Can't you just go and
speak to Judge Bazile?

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.970
I mean, we ain't hurting anybody.

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.591
- I don't think that...
- Well, just talk to him.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.142
Just talk to him.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.978
Just tell him if he lets
us back in the state,

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:41.516
we won't bother anybody.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.528
Look, I do not think that this case

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.906
will be resolved in Judge Bazile's court,

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:56.240
or probably any other court
in the state of Virginia.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:08:00.744
I believe this is a court battle that could
go all the way to the Supreme Court.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:10.254
We're listening.

01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:17.761
Our problem is that in order
to appeal the judgment of conviction,

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:20.433
we would have needed to
do so within 60 days.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:23.937
Now, given that it's been five
years since that conviction,

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.856
we have to find a way
to get it back into the courts.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.899
- Are you following?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.527
Mmm-hmm.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:32.278
Now, I've given this some thought,

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:36.238
and I have a somewhat unorthodox
idea on how to do this.

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:40.662
My suggestion would be for the two
of you to return to Caroline County,

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:45.292
get re-arrested, and then we will
have an avenue for our appeal.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.341
You want us to get arrested again?

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:54.630
Yes. It's an idea.

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:56.557
I, of course, will be
there to bail you out.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:05.103
We aren't gonna do that.

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.020
Right...

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:13.115
I can see how that was a mistake.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.033
I understand.

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:22.036
Look, I need to do some more
thinking on this first issue, but,

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:24.915
bottom line is we are gonna
get you all some help.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:32.627
We appreciate you.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:35.631
We really do.

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:39.763
Yeah.

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.639
If it gets us home, we'll take their help.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:31.564
Well, you get what you pay for.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:48.744
Get off the street!

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:09.686
Lee, give him a hand!

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:22.448
You gotta pull that concrete. Yeah.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:23.529
Pull more.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.201
- Whoo-hoo!
- I got it!

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:30.536
Hey!

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.338
Look out!

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:39.253
Donald!

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.387
Momma!

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.518
Momma!

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.362
- Mildred!
- Up here!

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:51.830
What's going on?

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.500
Donald got hit by a car today.

01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:58.920
What?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.422
He's fine.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:04.509
Just scraped and bruised is all.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:14.640
Hey.

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:16.767
You okay?

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.916
I wanna move 'em back to the country.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.882
I don't care what they do to us.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.514
I won't raise my family here.

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:05.381
All right. Y'all get loaded up now.
Come on.

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:06.672
Thank you, Al.

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:07.924
Thank you, Don.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:11.177
Thank you, Miss Laura.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:12.383
Hmm.

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:17.514
You just go on.

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.446
I'll see you tonight.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:38.167
- You all be good.
- Okay, Daddy.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:42.807
Hey.

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:08.666
Daddy!

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:29.274
My cousin has a house he might rent out.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:32.065
But I thought Jim's brother
said it was fine here.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:36.069
I don't trust them. Too many people.

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:40.739
Where is it?

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:42.416
King and Queen County.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.577
Just a farmhouse up there.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:47.372
I figure it gets you out the county,
but keeps you close.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:49.123
You'll be on your own out there.

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:50.833
It don't have no phone or nothing,

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:53.510
but no one's gonna find you
unless they know to look.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.218
I can get word to you when you need it.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:58.891
How much you think he'd want for it?

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:01.056
Ah, he'll be fair.

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:00.824
Hey, look.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.163
Peggy!

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:56.333
Hey.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:59.465
I'll try and get home before dark.

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:00.546
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:03.465
We'll be fine.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:17.154
"We haven't heard anything from you
for so long we had given up hope."

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:30.702
Martha, call Chet Antieau's office at
Georgetown Law and try to set a meeting.

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:32.127
Yes, Mr. Cohen.

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:36.794
Come in.

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:39.546
I'd never seen anything like it, you know.

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:40.839
Excuse me.

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:43.923
No matter how many times I get down south,
there's always something that surprises me.

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:47.597
Oh, yes. Please bring him back.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:49.014
This is good timing.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.058
I want you to meet
a former student of mine.

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:53.186
He called about a case
you may find interesting.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:56.355
Yeah, sure. What's it about?

01:20:56.435 --> 01:21:00.234
Well, we only spoke briefly
on the phone, but, in essence...

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.150
Ah...

01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:03.779
Hello, Professor, thanks for seeing me.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.736
My pleasure.
You've come at a good time, Bernie.

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.032
This is Phil Hirschkop.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.955
He's a brilliant civil rights lawyer.

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:11.870
Nice to meet you.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:13.042
So...

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:15.041
What's the problem?

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:16.834
Well, I'm a bit stumped.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:21.002
The ACLU referred me to this case
concerning an interracial couple

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:22.803
that was married in D.C.

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.843
They were arrested for
living together in Virginia,

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:27.550
and the judge suspended their sentence

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:30.261
under order that they
leave the state for 25 years.

01:21:31.178 --> 01:21:34.143
I filed a motion to vacate the
judgment with Judge Bazile,

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:37.062
the original trial judge
in Caroline County,

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:38.314
but he's stonewalling me.

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:43.566
Of course, the ACLU sees this,
and I agree, as a potential contender

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:46.448
to repeal the anti-miscegenation
laws nationwide.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:50.580
I just need to get the
ball rolling, as it were.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:57.747
It's a very delicate
situation because by appealing,

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.504
you open up the possibility of
sending them both to prison.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:05.090
I think regardless, file the 1983
motion explaining your complaint.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:08.594
It'll force Bazile's hand and get you
in front of a federal three-judge panel.

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:09.762
All right.

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:11.305
Look, I got to catch a plane
to New York tonight,

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:13.387
but I'll work up a draft
and I'll find you on Monday?

01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:16.602
Great. That's just great. Thank you.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.772
Yeah. And, Bernie,
if you don't mind me asking,

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:22.403
how much experience do you have
with constitutional law?

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:24.030
Some.

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:29.494
Very little.

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:34.162
You realize this case could alter
the constitution of the United States?

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:36.869
I do.

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.044
I'll call you on Monday.

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:45.214
One, two, three!

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:48.548
I'm a good dog!

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:56.642
I can never get mine to rise.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.396
It's not you. It's the humidity.

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:01.902
Just thick.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.812
Come look, Meme. Come look.

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:05.944
- Peggy.
- She's fine.

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:08.116
What you want from your Meme?

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.573
Lilly won't share her tea.

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:14.073
She must be upset.

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:16.743
Well, she wants to sit with us out here.

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:38.188
Momma, get Peggy inside!

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:41.604
Bean!

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.940
Hey. What is it?

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:50.367
Well, I got a message for you.

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:52.990
What?

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:55.789
Well, that lawyer called.
Said he wanna meet with y'all.

01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:00.878
Sidney! Donald!

01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:05.757
Raymond, why you
driving so fast like that?

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:08.630
What you mean? I always drive like that.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:15.676
- What?
- Richard.

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:20.643
- What is it?
- It's okay.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.104
"Almighty God created
the races white, black,

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:30.569
"yellow, Malay, and red, and he
placed them on separate continents.

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:32.902
"And but for the interference
with his arrangement

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:35.113
"there would be no cause
for such marriages.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:37.868
"The fact that he separated the races

01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:40.417
"shows that he did not intend
for the races to mix."

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:47.003
I know it sounds strange,
but this is really wonderful.

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:50.923
By issuing this ruling, Judge Bazile
has really given us a road map

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:52.676
right to the Supreme Court.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.558
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:59.595
He ruled against us again.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:03.727
That's right, but now we're allowed
to appeal that ruling to the state.

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:07.944
From there, if the state rules against you,
we'll have a chance at the Supreme Court.

01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:12.908
That sounds wonderful.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:16.278
I have one little piece of housekeeping.

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:19.952
LIFE magazine contacted us about
sending a photographer out to you all.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:23.872
Keeping the possibility of
the Supreme Court in mind,

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:28.377
I think it's a fair idea that we
raise the profile of your case,

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:32.841
but I, of course, want to make sure
that you are all comfortable with that.

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:40.723
It'll be fine.

01:25:58.028 --> 01:25:59.280
Hello!

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:09.589
Grey Villet, LIFE magazine. Pleasure.

01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:12.918
What you got there, a small block?

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.007
Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:16.259
What's the trouble?

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:18.427
Carburetors.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:19.508
Oh.

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:23.054
Then you're a better mechanic than me.

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:26.440
If you rejet them,
it goes faster, though, right?

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:29.567
I'm sure you already know that.

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:31.858
Is your wife inside?

01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:33.271
Uh-huh.

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:42.330
Oh. Hello.

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:46.076
Grey Villet. LIFE magazine.

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:47.911
May I?

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:49.541
Of course. Come in.

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:53.420
Oh. Something smells good in there.

01:26:54.668 --> 01:26:57.758
So, I can't go back without
a photo. No photo, no job.

01:26:57.838 --> 01:27:00.717
And this is LIFE magazine and
the pigeon guy isn't around.

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:02.551
- Pigeon guy?
- Pigeon guy?

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:03.760
That's right.

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:06.393
Looking up at this office
building and it hits me.

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:10.601
Right. I go 55 stories up

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.979
and I talk some office girls
into letting me look out the window.

01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:16.607
Before they could do anything,
I throw open the window,

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.403
sit on the ledge and dangle my feet out.

01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:22.449
They start screaming,
but I got this great shot

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:25.533
of my feet flying over
42nd and 5th Avenue.

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:27.793
Yeah. So what happened?

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.913
Security threw me out head first.

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:33.878
But, LIFE magazine hired me the next day.

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:37.632
That's a story, all right.

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:40.802
Yeah, that's a story, all right.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:47.471
You go to the Virginia
State Court next, right?

01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:48.771
Yes.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:52.066
You nervous?

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.064
I suppose.

01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:55.357
Hmm.

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:57.485
The lawyers told us not to expect much.

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:00.192
You think you'll lose?

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:02.611
Well, yes.

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:05.951
But I think it's all right.

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:10.877
We may lose the small battles,
but win the big war.

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:27.764
- ...coleslaw.
- Yeah.

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:29.846
And here's the surprise.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:32.019
Some of my new homemade pickles.

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:37.274
That certainly is a wonderful surprise.

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:41.069
Look at that, Barney, Aunt Bee's brought
us some of her homemade pickles.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.243
I see. Sure is wonderful.

01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:45.237
You really shouldn't have, Aunt Bee.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.992
That's right, Aunt Bee.

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:50.576
You go to way yonder too
much trouble to please us.

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:52.787
It's no trouble at all.

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:55.088
There's plenty. I made eight quarts.

01:28:55.247 --> 01:28:56.835
Eight quarts?

01:28:56.915 --> 01:29:00.169
Aunt Bee made eight quarts. Eight quarts.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.424
You can have some every day.

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:06.386
Well, I had an awful big breakfast.

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:09.014
I just stuffed myself something fierce.

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:10.766
Have some pickles.

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:11.972
Here you are.

01:29:14.057 --> 01:29:16.059
And here you are.

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:26.698
Mr. Loving. Mr. Loving.

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:28.576
They just wanna ask you a few questions.

01:29:31.491 --> 01:29:33.289
Uh... All right.

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.875
Mrs. Loving, you rolling?

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.673
Mrs. Loving, the Virginia Supreme Court
just ruled against you.

01:29:43.753 --> 01:29:46.006
How do you feel about
what happened here today?

01:29:46.923 --> 01:29:48.391
Well, I feel hopeful.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:50.219
I'm hopeful.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.554
And where will you go now?

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.607
Well, I guess we'll go back to Washington.

01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:58.814
You'll go back to Washington?

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:02.647
Mr. Loving, do you have anything to say
about what went on in the court today?

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.816
No. I don't have anything to say.

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:07.118
Okay. Thank you, folks, very much.

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:08.654
Did you get that?

01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:10.990
- I think so.
- Okay, cut, Tommy.

01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:14.830
Mr. and Mrs. Loving?

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:21.878
We wanted you to know that, with all
this travel back and forth from Virginia,

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:24.086
you have my number
and if anybody arrests you,

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:26.137
you have them get in touch with us.

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:29.261
We're not gonna let you spend
one minute longer in jail

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:32.185
than it takes us to get down
there to get you out, okay?

01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:33.932
Okay.

01:30:34.012 --> 01:30:35.684
Good luck to you.

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:36.936
You did a good job today.

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:39.896
Well, I sure appreciate
what y'all are doing.

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:41.102
Okay.

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:42.232
Well, we'll see you soon.

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:43.313
Bye.

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:48.238
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:52.284
You know they aren't
going back to Washington.

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:55.496
And there's no guarantee we can
get them out if they get arrested again.

01:30:56.826 --> 01:30:57.998
Mmm-hmm.

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:30.855
Sidney!

01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:34.029
Sidney!

01:33:36.694 --> 01:33:38.412
I want you to go next
door to the neighbor.

01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:40.410
You gonna ask him to use the telephone

01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:43.369
and you gonna call Raymond
and ask him to bring his gun, okay?

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.670
Go. Go on now.
Run through the woods. Go on.

01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:52.753
Everything okay?

01:33:54.212 --> 01:33:55.338
It's fine.

01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:58.007
Richard?

01:33:58.091 --> 01:33:59.308
Go on inside.

01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:38.765
That truck may have
just been going fishing.

01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:44.979
Could be.

01:34:46.723 --> 01:34:49.272
You ever hear from anyone
at your work about it?

01:34:52.979 --> 01:34:54.606
Not to my face.

01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:07.952
Well, I'll tell you this, Rich,
nobody gonna tell you what you can't do.

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.804
You're all set.

01:35:23.968 --> 01:35:24.969
Thank you.

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:27.810
Who we gonna call, Momma?

01:35:27.972 --> 01:35:29.849
I don't want you calling anybody.

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:32.393
How did that go?

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.153
Doctor said she'll be fine.

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:35.529
Just put her on aspirin.

01:35:36.773 --> 01:35:37.774
Who was that?

01:35:38.358 --> 01:35:39.735
Telephone man.

01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:42.078
Richard had him install a phone.

01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:44.538
Momma, you feel okay?

01:35:44.656 --> 01:35:45.657
Yes.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:47.787
- You got some tea I can drink?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:48.868
All right.

01:36:11.516 --> 01:36:14.861
Testing, testing. Testing.

01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:20.028
What do you think you would do if you...

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:21.360
If you lose the case?

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:25.030
Well...

01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:30.543
If we lose, then we would have
to go back to Washington.

01:36:31.577 --> 01:36:34.334
And how does that make you feel
having to go back to Washington?

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:36.007
Mildred?

01:36:40.503 --> 01:36:41.504
Come here.

01:36:47.427 --> 01:36:48.553
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:03.785
I don't want those people here.

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:06.078
I'm done with all these cameras!

01:37:07.113 --> 01:37:08.535
Well, I think it's important.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:13.077
These people want to help us, Richard.

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:42.235
Well, actually, although I'm sure
the publicity isn't very pleasant,

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:46.532
if it works out for you, it will work out
for a lot of other people, too.

01:37:47.111 --> 01:37:48.112
Yes.

01:37:49.322 --> 01:37:50.323
I hope so.

01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:53.496
It's the principle.

01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:55.544
It's the law. I don't think it's right.

01:37:56.579 --> 01:38:01.509
And if... If we do win,
we will be helping a lot of people.

01:38:02.502 --> 01:38:03.754
Mmm-hmm.

01:38:05.088 --> 01:38:08.012
And I knew... I know we have some enemies,

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:09.809
but we have some friends, too.

01:38:11.803 --> 01:38:15.355
So it really don't make a difference
about my enemies.

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:35.994
Push in hard on that one.

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:37.415
You go straight down the way, okay?

01:38:37.495 --> 01:38:39.042
I got it. I got it. Don't worry about it.

01:38:39.122 --> 01:38:40.248
- Hey. Good ride.
- All right.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.003
Make sure you get it
into second as quick as you can.

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:43.335
- You got it.
- All right.

01:38:57.849 --> 01:38:59.312
Car looks good.

01:38:59.392 --> 01:39:00.769
Yeah, it's running all right.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:06.316
You see him driving today.

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:08.868
It was like he was sitting
in the back seat.

01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:20.124
Oh, man. I miss you, Rich.

01:39:20.204 --> 01:39:21.918
Hell, I can say it.

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:23.295
Hey, Percy, don't you miss Rich?

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:24.716
Yeah.

01:39:26.169 --> 01:39:27.796
I miss you too, Virgil.

01:39:30.423 --> 01:39:33.142
Man. So, what's all this you got going?

01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:35.853
- All what?
- What you got.

01:39:36.262 --> 01:39:38.356
You just went made it hard now.

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:42.568
No, no. You think I'm crazy,
but you know what hard is now, don't you?

01:39:43.686 --> 01:39:44.687
Yeah.

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:47.068
Richard, you are white.

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.869
Now, you may think you're like
a black man, but you're white.

01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:53.991
You hang around all these black folks,

01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:56.073
but when you go to work,
you're still white.

01:39:57.241 --> 01:39:58.413
But not now.

01:39:59.285 --> 01:40:01.413
Now you know what it feels
like now, don't you?

01:40:03.498 --> 01:40:05.421
You're black now, ain't you?

01:40:06.083 --> 01:40:08.256
- You're a damn fool.
- All right, come on now.

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.467
No, he needs to hear it.

01:40:11.464 --> 01:40:13.887
Look, every nigga in here
wish they were you, Rich,

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.018
and you ain't got sense enough for it.

01:40:16.427 --> 01:40:18.850
You got a fix. I ain't got no fix.

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:21.477
So yours is easy.

01:40:21.557 --> 01:40:23.025
All you gotta do is divorce her.

01:40:24.227 --> 01:40:25.523
Divorce her?

01:40:25.603 --> 01:40:27.355
All you gotta do.

01:40:30.942 --> 01:40:32.488
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Really.

01:40:34.403 --> 01:40:35.996
- I'm gonna divorce her.
- That it.

01:40:37.782 --> 01:40:39.534
That's all you gotta do, right?

01:40:39.617 --> 01:40:41.210
That's all you gotta do.

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:48.880
Apologize now, Virgil.

01:41:47.476 --> 01:41:48.693
Come to bed, Richard.

01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:53.282
We've been

01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:56.953
talking to lawyers for

01:41:59.363 --> 01:42:01.036
near 10 years now.

01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:12.422
Let's go to bed.

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:19.350
I can take care of you.

01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:24.393
I know that.

01:42:34.732 --> 01:42:36.325
I can take care of you.

01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:45.997
I know.

01:42:49.914 --> 01:42:52.838
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:42:53.626 --> 01:42:54.627
It's okay.

01:43:54.603 --> 01:43:55.980
It's very good.

01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:00.909
Well, I have some really terrific news.

01:44:01.694 --> 01:44:03.783
The Supreme Court has agreed
to hear our case.

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:08.201
Now, of course, the state
of Virginia will mount their defense,

01:44:08.701 --> 01:44:10.915
but we are feeling very good
about our chances here.

01:44:10.995 --> 01:44:13.623
You've got the full weight
of the ACLU behind this.

01:44:15.958 --> 01:44:17.505
- It's a miracle.
- Hmm.

01:44:20.004 --> 01:44:21.347
What's their defense?

01:44:22.798 --> 01:44:23.845
I'm sorry?

01:44:24.008 --> 01:44:25.351
Virginia.

01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:29.685
How are they gonna defend
what they done to us?

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:33.142
I guess we won't know until the hearing,

01:44:33.225 --> 01:44:35.564
but it's likely that they'll use

01:44:35.644 --> 01:44:38.193
a defense similar to something
they've used before.

01:44:39.815 --> 01:44:41.112
What's that?

01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:49.204
It's your kids.

01:44:53.537 --> 01:44:54.584
Our kids?

01:44:59.293 --> 01:45:02.297
The state of Virginia
will argue that it is unfair

01:45:02.379 --> 01:45:04.973
to bring children
of mixed race into the world.

01:45:09.386 --> 01:45:11.559
They believe the children are bastards.

01:45:23.609 --> 01:45:25.656
Now, as the defendants in this trial,

01:45:25.736 --> 01:45:28.330
you are allowed to come
and hear the arguments.

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:35.003
No. We don't need to do that.

01:45:37.039 --> 01:45:40.838
It's a tremendous honor to sit with
the Supreme Court. Very few people...

01:45:40.918 --> 01:45:42.090
No.

01:45:45.506 --> 01:45:46.598
That's fine.

01:45:48.843 --> 01:45:49.890
Excuse me.

01:46:03.274 --> 01:46:04.321
Mildred?

01:46:09.613 --> 01:46:11.536
I wouldn't go without him.

01:46:36.974 --> 01:46:40.353
You know, Richard, it's, of course,
up to you not to attend but,

01:46:41.979 --> 01:46:46.701
you should know, the Supreme Court
only hears one out of every 400 cases.

01:46:47.484 --> 01:46:48.531
It's historic.

01:46:55.826 --> 01:46:56.998
Thank you, Mr. Cohen.

01:46:58.996 --> 01:47:01.715
Well. Is there anything
you'd like me to say to them?

01:47:03.834 --> 01:47:07.464
And by "them" I mean the Supreme
Court justices of the United States?

01:47:16.013 --> 01:47:17.060
Yeah.

01:47:22.436 --> 01:47:23.483
You can tell the judge...

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:29.197
Tell the judge I love my wife.

01:48:10.401 --> 01:48:12.904
You okay to park? Thanks, Martha.

01:48:20.577 --> 01:48:22.329
Number 395.

01:48:24.081 --> 01:48:28.336
Richard Perry Loving et al, Appellants,

01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:31.297
v. Virginia.

01:48:38.637 --> 01:48:40.059
Mr. Hirschkop.

01:48:50.983 --> 01:48:53.907
Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices,
may it please the court?

01:48:57.781 --> 01:49:03.245
You have before you today
what we consider the most odious

01:49:03.328 --> 01:49:05.918
of the segregation laws
and the slavery laws,

01:49:05.998 --> 01:49:09.127
and our view of this law,
and we hope to clearly show,

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:12.713
is that this is a slavery law.

01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:19.513
We ask that the Court consider
the full spectrum of these laws

01:49:19.595 --> 01:49:20.891
and not just the criminality,

01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:25.067
because it's more than criminality
that's at point here.

01:49:26.477 --> 01:49:28.024
It's the right to inherit land,

01:49:29.688 --> 01:49:31.440
the legitimacy of children,

01:49:32.483 --> 01:49:33.985
and many, many rights.

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:37.912
Mr. Cohen.

01:49:46.538 --> 01:49:48.381
Mr. Chief Justice,
may it please the court?

01:49:50.793 --> 01:49:55.097
What is the danger to the state
of Virginia of interracial marriage?

01:50:01.178 --> 01:50:06.229
What is the state of danger
to the people of interracial marriage?

01:50:09.812 --> 01:50:11.189
Marriage

01:50:12.523 --> 01:50:14.196
is a fundamental right.

01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:30.851
Hello?

01:51:32.436 --> 01:51:33.938
- Mrs. Loving?
- Yes.

01:51:34.313 --> 01:51:35.610
It's Bernard Cohen.

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.942
Oh, hello, Mr. Cohen.

01:51:38.859 --> 01:51:41.198
I'm calling with great news.

01:51:41.278 --> 01:51:43.622
- Just wanted to let you know.
- What's that?

01:51:53.248 --> 01:51:54.295
Yes, I'm here.

01:51:57.252 --> 01:51:58.629
That's wonderful news.

01:52:02.257 --> 01:52:03.759
Yes, I understand.

01:52:09.598 --> 01:52:10.645
Okay.

01:52:12.935 --> 01:52:14.437
Thank you, Mr. Cohen.

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:08.240
Mr. Loving? Mr. Loving?

01:53:08.657 --> 01:53:10.785
Mr. Loving, how does it feel
to have the Supreme Court...

01:53:11.368 --> 01:53:13.165
Have you heard from the Attorney General?

01:53:13.245 --> 01:53:15.334
Mrs. Loving, what does
this mean to your family?

01:53:15.414 --> 01:53:17.132
Do you plan to return to Virginia?

01:53:18.166 --> 01:53:19.759
Have you talked to the Attorney General?

01:53:20.711 --> 01:53:23.931
Several Southern states have
already announced this ruling...

01:53:39.354 --> 01:53:40.901
Take that to your daddy.

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:52.659
Oh.

01:53:54.411 --> 01:53:55.754
- Wanna help me?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:53:57.497 --> 01:53:58.965
You wanna brush the wall?

01:53:59.305 --> 01:54:05.697
