Well, I think we can rule out suicide.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.114
Good to see you too, Greyvenstein.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.657
How's that wife of yours?

15:49.741 --> 15:52.535
-Attractive, yet demanding.
-Well, you keep her happy.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.707

-What a shit-show.

GREYVENSTEIN: Yeah.

off the security cameras?

16:02.212 --> 16:04.172

Now, I don't want
to speak ill of the dead,

16:06.216 --> 16:07.634
but Caddock was a certified cocksucker.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.261
I mean, every psycho in the city
wanted to see him killed.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.763
Probably some regular folk, too.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.265
Yeah, well, I'm sure it's hopeless,

16:14.349 --> 16:16.726
but we should probably
at least try and look busy.

-Yes.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.947
Sorry, I'm a little overwhelmed right now.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.323
Understandable.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.741
I just have one question.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.327
All of Caddock's files were destroyed.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.746
Seems like the perpetrators
were looking for something.

16:37.205 --> 16:40.125
Was there anything sensitive
that Caddock was working on right now,

16:40.208 --> 16:43.086
maybe something that might have
put a lot of bad guys in a tight spot?

16:43.169 --> 16:46.339
No, not anything out of the ordinary.
Not that I can think of.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.343
Would you excuse me, Detective?
I need to make a statement to the press.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.304
Still, I'm going to need to see
all of Caddock's current investigations.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.557
If you could hand over
any backup materials.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.767
Yeah, of course.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.107
Oh, ADA,

17:04.816 --> 17:07.234
do you know where
the security footage is kept?

17:07.777 --> 17:10.195
The security suite, first floor.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.906
Hopefully, the cameras caught everything.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.452
Yeah. Hopefully.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.972
Well, after Payne removed his intestines,

17:36.056 --> 17:38.016
and Jag got his molars,

17:38.099 --> 17:40.310
then we just sort of
tossed him out the window.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.897
Sounds like a splendid evening.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.359
But I am a tad confused on one detail.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.071
At what point did you find the data chip?

17:51.613 --> 17:53.448
ALL: We even searched the house.
Nothing there.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.866
We looked...

17:55.742 --> 17:58.203
Sir, that's what we have so far.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.455
That's the only person we saw him talk to.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.083
We don't know who she is.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.002
She's probably swarmed
with surveillance by now.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.504
Look at this.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.800
The human body,
a squishy pouch of paper skin,

18:11.883 --> 18:13.885
filled with soft cartilage,

18:14.511 --> 18:16.388
tender muscles, quivering organs...

18:18.348 --> 18:19.391
Pathetic.

18:20.392 --> 18:24.062
Why did nature equip lesser creatures
with exoskeletons,

18:24.145 --> 18:25.605

18:25.689 --> 18:28.441
Why are such gifts
considered out of reach?

18:28.525 --> 18:29.651
I'll tell you why.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.278
Because God has forsaken you.
But I didn't.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.281
I made you whole.
You, my creations, will be the ones

18:35.365 --> 18:37.283

he was always sort of

a shadow in my life.

stand up straight and smile,
