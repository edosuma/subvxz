00:59.320 --> 01:01.846
[indistinct chatter]

01:07.720 --> 01:12.681
[William] What went we out
into this wilderness to find?

01:12.800 --> 01:16.691
Leaving our country, kindred...

01:18.160 --> 01:20.208
...our father's houses?

01:23.640 --> 01:26.086
We travailed a vast ocean...

01:27.200 --> 01:31.046
For what? For what?

01:31.120 --> 01:32.804
[Governor]
We must ask thee to be silent.

01:32.880 --> 01:38.842
[William] Was it not for the pure
and faithful dispensation of the Gospels

01:38.920 --> 01:42.003
-and the Kingdom of God?
-[Deputy governor] No more!

01:42.120 --> 01:45.044
We are yourjudges,
and not you ours.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.010
[William] I cannot be judged
by false Christians,

01:48.120 --> 01:52.603
for I have done nothing
save preach Christ through gospel.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.603
[Governor]
Must you continue to dishonor

01:54.680 --> 02:00.323
the laws of the commonwealth and the
church with your prideful conceit?

02:04.720 --> 02:08.042
[William]
If my conscience sees it fit.

02:08.120 --> 02:12.523
[Governor] Then shall you be banished
from this plantation's liberties!

02:16.840 --> 02:19.320
[William]
I would be glad on it.

02:21.560 --> 02:26.043
[Governor] Then take your leave
and trouble us no further.

02:28.560 --> 02:33.043
[William] How sadly hath the Lord
testified against you.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.045
Katherine.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.284
Thomasin.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.647

03:15.080 --> 03:20.405
<i>[Katherine]
I will confess Jehovah with all heart</i>

<i>[singing continues, distant]</i>

04:48.160 --> 04:52.688

04:58.400 --> 05:03.167
I here confess
I've lived in sin.

05:03.320 --> 05:09.043
I've been idle of my work,
disobedient to my parents,

05:09.160 --> 05:11.401
neglectful of my prayer.

05:13.400 --> 05:18.645
<i>I have, in secret,
played upon my Sabbath.</i>

05:18.720 --> 05:22.361
<i>And broken every one of thy
commandments in thought.</i>

05:24.240 --> 05:28.928
<i>Followed the desires of mine own
will, and not the Holy Spirit.</i>

05:31.960 --> 05:35.726
<i>I know I deserve more shame
and misery in this life...</i>

05:36.720 --> 05:39.690
<i>...and everlasting hellfire.</i>

05:42.120 --> 05:47.604
But I beg Thee...
for the sake of Thy Son...

05:48.840 --> 05:53.767
forgive me, show me mercy,

05:53.840 --> 05:56.571
show me Thy light.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.721
[giggling]

06:38.800 --> 06:40.802
Where is Sam?
Where is Sam?

06:40.920 --> 06:43.764
Where is that little man?

06:43.880 --> 06:45.928
B00!

06:46.000 --> 06:48.924
There you are, there you are.

Caleb.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.125
God give you good morrow.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.567
All are still a-bed.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.041
Save Mother.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.084
Tis no ease to rise on a gray day.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.845
The Devil holds
fast your eyelids.

<i>- I'll</i> wake em.
- No, let em be.

12:16.640 --> 12:20.964
Thy Mother's not slept
a night since...

12:25.880 --> 12:30.568
We can search no more, Caleb.
We cannot.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.323
If not a wolf, then hunger
would have taken him yet.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.644
Let's to the wood.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.331
Been a'layin traps
for some while now,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.562
even before this new misery.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.210
Within the wood?

12:52.280 --> 12:54.487
Will thou not help thy father?

12:54.560 --> 12:57.803
You and Mother have always
forbade us to set foot there.

12:58.840 --> 13:02.970
Caleb, our harvest
cannot last the winter.

13:03.040 --> 13:07.011
We must catch our food
if we cannot grow it.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.801
We will conquer this wilderness.
It will not consume us.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.564
[crying]

14:35.800 --> 14:38.326
[William]
Aren't thou then born a sinner?

14:38.400 --> 14:43.281
[Caleb] Aye, I was conceived in sin
and born in iniquity.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.646
[William]
Then what is thy birth sin?

14:47.720 --> 14:52.442
Adam's sin imputed to me and a corrupt
nature dwelling within me.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.570
[William]
Well remembered, Caleb, very well.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.246
And canst thou tell me
what thy corrupt nature is?

14:59.320 --> 15:02.403
My corrupt nature is empty of grace,

15:02.480 --> 15:07.486
bent unto sin, only unto sin
and that continually.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.369
[William]
Soft now.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.843
We must lay it again.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.724
Was, was Samuel born a sinner?

15:47.840 --> 15:49.205
Aye.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.645
Am I then--

15:50.760 --> 15:54.242
We pray he hath entered
God's Kingdom.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.685
What wickedness
hath he done?

15:55.760 --> 15:57.808
Place faith in God, Caleb.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.531
We'll speak no more on thy brother.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.443
Why?

16:02.520 --> 16:05.285
He hath disappeared,
not one week passed.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.448
Yet you and Mother
utter not his name.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.522
He's gone, Caleb.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.444
- Tell me!
- Tell thee what?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.363
- Is he in hell?
- Caleb!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.408
Mother will not stop her prayer.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.608
And if I died, if I died this day...

16:19.680 --> 16:21.921
- What is this?
- I ought evil in me heart.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.644
- Me sins are not pardoned!
- Thou art youngly yet--

16:23.720 --> 16:25.643
And if God will not
hear my prayers?!

16:25.720 --> 16:27.882
- Caleb!
- Tell me!

16:28.640 --> 16:33.282
Look you,
I love thee marvelous well,

16:33.360 --> 16:34.805
but 'tis God alone, not man,

16:34.880 --> 16:37.884
what knows who is the son
of Abraham and who is not,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.129
who is good and who is evil.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.807
Fain would I tell thee
Sam sleeps in Jesus,

16:44.880 --> 16:47.565
that thou Wilt, that I Will.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.565
But I cannot tell thee that.
None can.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.561
Caleb?

16:58.640 --> 17:00.927
Where are these from?

17:01.040 --> 17:03.884
From Indian Tom and old Slater,
when last they past through.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.769
What did you trade?

17:08.040 --> 17:09.723
Thy Mother's silver cup.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.366
[egg cracks]

17:40.040 --> 17:43.761
Speak none of this to Mother. None.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.286
She's overwrought already.

17:47.280 --> 17:51.171
I'll tell her of the cup
when her grief has passed.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.369
Let's not speak on this again.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.124

It's your fault I can't leave the yard.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.882
I could go to the brook
before you let The Witch take Sam.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.042
- Quiet, thee.
- It were a wolf stole Sam.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.363
A witch. I've seen her in her
riding cloak, about the wood.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.165
- Father showed me the tracks.
- It was a witch.

25:02.240 --> 25:08.009
Aye, it was a witch,
Mercy, you speak aright.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.684
- Thomasin!
- It was I.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.091
Liar.

25:11.160 --> 25:15.563
Twas I what stole him,
I be the witch of the wood.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.689
- Liar! Liar!
- I am.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.524
List not to her, Mercy.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.807
I am that very witch.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.362
When I sleep, my spirit slips
away from my body

25:26.440 --> 25:29.205
and dances naked with The Devil.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.886
- That's how I signed his book.
- No.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.122
He bade me bring him an
unbaptized babe,

25:34.200 --> 25:38.364
so I stole Sam
and I gave him to me master.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.728
And I'll make any man
or thing else vanish I like.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.529
- No.
- Aye.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.682
And I'll vanish thee, too,
if thou displeaseth me.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.525
- Be quiet!
- Mercy, she's but telling fantasies.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.729
Perchance I boil and bake thee
since we're lack of food.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.928
- No!
- Stop, Thomasin!

25:54.000 --> 25:55.843
-L'ts not true!
- It is, thou thing!

25:55.920 --> 25:57.843
How I crave to sink my teeth
into thy pink flesh.

25:57.920 --> 25:58.921
[screaming]

25:59.000 --> 26:00.843
If ever thou tellst thy Mother of this,

26:00.920 --> 26:03.127
I'll witch thee and thy Mother!
And Jonas too!

26:03.200 --> 26:05.168
- Caleb!
- Stop thy tears and swear by silence.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.402
- I swear it.
- You'll not tell Mother nor father.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.086
- I swear.
- Th0masin! Let her alone.

26:10.160 --> 26:13.562
Get away from her, Caleb,
or she'll witch thee!

26:16.280 --> 26:19.329
Why tell Mercy
those horrible fantasies?

26:19.640 --> 26:24.089
- Dost thou hate me now too?
- It was a wolf stole Sam.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.449
Leave me be. Go tell Mother
and father of my wickedness.

26:29.520 --> 26:33.320
- Thomasin...
- I hate thy pity. I need it not.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.924
And forgive us the sins we have
this day committed against thee,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.721
free us from the shame and torment
which are due unto us, Father.

26:47.800 --> 26:51.327
We beseech thee, increase our faith
in the promise of the Gospel,

26:51.400 --> 26:55.246
our fear of thy name
and the hatred of all our sins,

26:55.320 --> 26:58.802
that we may be assured that
the Holy Spirit dwells in us.

26:58.880 --> 27:02.123
That we might be thy children
in thy love and mercy,

27:02.200 --> 27:04.851
but as we hunger
for this food of our bodies

27:04.920 --> 27:08.766
so our souls hunger
for the food of eternal life.

27:08.840 --> 27:13.289
Finish soon our days of sin,
and bring us to eternal peace

27:13.400 --> 27:15.971
through the purifying
blood of Thy Son,

27:16.040 --> 27:20.284
our Lord and only Savior
Jesus Christ.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.966
- Amen.
-[All] Amen.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.327
Thomasin, what's thou done
with the silver cup?

28:03.960 --> 28:06.406
[Thomasin]
ls't not on the shelf?

28:06.480 --> 28:08.323
Nay-

28:10.200 --> 28:11.486
In the six board, then.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.609
T'ain't there neither.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.286
It's been disappeared
for some while.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.606
Didst lose it?

28:21.400 --> 28:22.731
I've not touched it.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.844
Where has it gone then?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.160
[Thomasin]
lhavenTtouchediL

28:28.240 --> 28:30.208
[Katherine] I've caught thee
trifling with it before.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.851
She says she haven't touched it,
Katherine.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.409
How thou couldst lose my father's
silver wine cup in this hovel,

28:37.480 --> 28:38.845
- I cannot know.
-lhaven1touchediL

28:38.920 --> 28:41.764
Peace, child. It's gone.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.967
Did a wolf vanish that too?

28:50.320 --> 28:52.243
She haven't touched it, Katherine.

28:58.320 --> 29:02.245
What is amiss
on this farm? Hmm?

29:03.360 --> 29:04.600
It is not natural.

29:16.080 --> 29:21.484
Caleb, will thou read out
a chapter of the Word tonight?

29:23.680 --> 29:27.207
We must find some light
in our darkness.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.807
Tomorrow we will have a fast day
but for our sins.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.484
[sheep bleating]

29:39.040 --> 29:44.410
Thomasin, dist not bed them down
before supper?

29:44.800 --> 29:46.211
Baah,baah.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.520
[laughing]

29:52.200 --> 29:53.770
[door creaking]

29:53.840 --> 29:56.605
[sheep bleating]

30:00.800 --> 30:02.802
[rustling]

30:40.760 --> 30:45.368
Oh, Holy and blessed Spirit,
be with me and dwell in me heart.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.647
You must sleep tonight, Kate.

30:47.720 --> 30:51.964
This night and evermore, amen.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.087
Thou dost remember I love thee?

31:14.160 --> 31:15.491
[sniffing]

31:20.600 --> 31:22.011
I do.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.401
List me, Kate,

31:25.480 --> 31:29.724
I fear thou dost look
too much upon this affliction.

31:32.200 --> 31:37.081
We must turn our thoughts
towards God, not to ourselves.

31:40.800 --> 31:45.601
He hath never taken a child from us.
Never a one, Kate.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.490
Who might earn such grace?

31:54.320 --> 31:56.766
We have been
grateful of God's love.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.209
[Katherine]
He hath cursed this family.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.566
No.

32:05.640 --> 32:10.441
He hath taken us
into a very low condition to humble us

32:10.520 --> 32:15.048
and to show us more of His grace.

32:16.760 --> 32:21.129
Was not Christ lead into the wilderness
to be ill met by the Devil?

32:22.080 --> 32:24.162
We should ne'er have left
the plantation.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.571
Kate.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.325
- We should never have left!
- That damned church.

32:28.400 --> 32:32.769
- There's naught hither!
- Well, what need we? Silver chalices?

32:34.360 --> 32:37.762
How dare you chide me on a cup?

32:37.840 --> 32:41.083
Tis not for vanity
that I am grieved of it.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.208
[sniffing]

32:49.240 --> 32:50.605
Katherine, I must tell thee--

32:50.680 --> 32:53.206
- We might have sold it.
- What?

32:53.280 --> 32:57.001
What fool would trade for our corn?

32:57.120 --> 32:58.610
[sniffing]

32:58.680 --> 33:04.050
List me, our daughter hath begat
the sign of her womanhood.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.843
Thomasin? Caleb?

33:09.920 --> 33:12.241
Are you abed?

33:12.320 --> 33:14.288
Mercy?

33:15.280 --> 33:16.520
Jonas?

33:18.280 --> 33:23.571
She's old enough.
She must leave to serve another family.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.644
[William] Twas not her fault.
Kate, I must tell thee...

33:26.720 --> 33:29.769
[Katherine] Aye, it was thine
for taking thy family hither.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.171
[William]
This is Godly land.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.685
[Katherine]
Godly?

33:32.760 --> 33:34.649
Our children are being fostered up
like savages.

33:34.720 --> 33:35.960
[William]
Kate!

33:36.040 --> 33:39.203
[Katherine] How oft I begged and begged
thee to take Samuel for baptism?

33:39.280 --> 33:41.760
[William] They'd not baptize
outside the congregation.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.729
[Katherine]
Our Sam is in hell!

33:43.800 --> 33:46.644
[William]
Go to.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.522
[Katherine]
God save us, Caleb is well.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.523
[William] We must keep him still.
And Thomasin.

33:52.600 --> 33:53.965
[Katherine]
Our corn is trash!

33:54.040 --> 33:56.088
[William]
We cannot back to that church.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.571
[Katherine]
We will starve!

33:57.680 --> 34:02.083
[William] Peace, peace.
You'll wake them, peace.

34:02.160 --> 34:05.050
[Katherine crying throughout]

34:06.560 --> 34:11.487
[William] I'll to the village
with the horse and Thomasin tomorrow.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.005
The Tildens or the Whythings,

34:14.080 --> 34:16.650
they can make use of her.

34:16.719 --> 34:19.643
They're good folk.

34:19.719 --> 34:22.963
Stop, Kate.

34:23.080 --> 34:26.766
We will find food, I know it.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.724
[Thomasin]
Caleb?

34:52.960 --> 34:55.440
What are you doing?

34:55.520 --> 34:57.090
Go to sleep.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.447
What is this?
Tell me, now.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.205
- Running away then?
- No.

35:06.280 --> 35:08.044
- Lie not to me.
- I don't.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.691
Then what?

35:10.760 --> 35:12.250
Tell me!

35:12.320 --> 35:16.120
If thou went back to sleep
and kept silent of this,

35:16.200 --> 35:17.531
I promise thee,

35:17.600 --> 35:22.242
you'll need not leave to serve
the Tildens nor any family else.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.766
I'll be back by mid-day.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.646
- Well, let me along with ya.
- No.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.326
- Let me along.
- I cannot.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.203
If you don't let me along with ya,

35:35.320 --> 35:37.129
I'll wake Mother
and father this instant.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.890
Well?

36:01.800 --> 36:03.370
Aye, but we did!

36:03.440 --> 36:05.090
- Nay.
- We did!

36:05.160 --> 36:06.969
No.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.451
We had glass windows in England.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.961
We haven't been hither
so long you can forget that.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.644
As you like, Thomasin?

36:12.720 --> 36:14.961
You've gone mad.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.964
Dost not remember Fowler
laying on the floor in the sun?

36:18.040 --> 36:20.805
- You must!
- Nay.

36:20.880 --> 36:24.282
And where the sun would shine,
would he warm himself.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.409
Remember once he lay upon the table,
and father saw him and he saith,

36:27.480 --> 36:29.289
"We will have him for meat!

36:29.360 --> 36:32.011
Kate! Kate!
We will roast this beast."

36:32.080 --> 36:34.651
You must remember that!

36:34.720 --> 36:39.248
[Caleb] I remember that day,
but no glass.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.722
Well... it was pretty.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.531
[dog barking]

36:47.400 --> 36:49.004
What is't, boy?

36:52.360 --> 36:54.647
[Caleb] Burt, calm thee!

36:54.720 --> 36:57.451
Fowler! Nay, Fowler!

36:58.360 --> 36:59.725
Stand here with Burt.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.646
- Caleb, no.
<i>- I'll</i> straight back.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.768
He's gone mad!

37:05.840 --> 37:07.046
[yelps]

37:11.320 --> 37:13.322
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

37:13.400 --> 37:15.129
- Thomasin!
- Thomasin!

37:15.240 --> 37:19.564
- Caleb!
- Caleb!

37:19.640 --> 37:24.567
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

37:24.640 --> 37:27.450
[William] Thomasin!

37:27.520 --> 37:31.366
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

37:33.560 --> 37:38.088
[heavy breathing]

37:38.160 --> 37:40.686
Thomasin!

37:41.760 --> 37:44.764
[attempted whistling]

37:48.160 --> 37:50.208
Fowler!

37:50.280 --> 37:52.362
[heavy breathing]

37:53.440 --> 37:57.161
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
o help me and I'll leave my sin.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.727
For I repentant now shall be,
From evil I will turn to Thee.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.367
None ever shall destroy my faith,
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

38:04.440 --> 38:08.161
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O, help me and I'll leave my sin,

38:08.280 --> 38:11.682
For I repentant now shall be,
from evil I will turn to Thee.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.330
None ever shall destroy my faith,

38:13.400 --> 38:15.368
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.643
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O help me and I--

38:18.720 --> 38:20.529
[dog barking]

38:21.000 --> 38:23.321
[dog screaming]

38:50.320 --> 38:52.482
<i>Caleb!</i>

38:59.880 --> 39:01.723
<i>Caleb!</i>

40:13.000 --> 40:15.606
- Caleb!
- Father!

40:15.680 --> 40:17.091
Thomasin.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.530
Oh, my girl, my girl.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.088
Where is thy brother?

42:14.800 --> 42:17.565
[thunderstorm]

42:19.160 --> 42:20.400
[heavy breathing]

42:20.520 --> 42:23.285
What's the matter with thee, Thomasin?
What's the matter with thee?

42:23.360 --> 42:27.001
I'll set off at first light.
I'll not return until I've found him.

42:27.080 --> 42:30.050
T'w0uld be better to go to the village
to raise up help, I cannot--

42:30.120 --> 42:32.521
[William]
Tis a day's ride and I have no horse.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.125
There's no time to be lost.

42:34.200 --> 42:37.010
Likely you should have left
this morn, then.

42:37.080 --> 42:39.606
You have no gun, William,
nay, not even a dog.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.682
- Be not a fool!
- I am a fool to go.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.161
There is none will help this family.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.927
Let me be!

42:49.960 --> 42:52.440
The moon is bright,
the rain bothers me not.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.404
I'll be back in a two-day,
if any a man will return with me.

42:55.480 --> 42:58.245
- Don't go, Father!
- Enough!

43:01.840 --> 43:04.320
Tell us why you went to the wood.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.801
- I promised.
- I care not!

43:10.640 --> 43:12.608
Let me find favor in your eyes.

43:12.680 --> 43:15.809
Oh, child, tell me and I will!

43:18.600 --> 43:19.840
I, um...

43:22.520 --> 43:24.602
[Katherine]
Speak!

43:24.720 --> 43:26.324
L...

43:26.920 --> 43:29.082
I took thy father's cup.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.164
I sold it.

43:38.320 --> 43:42.882
Forgive me, Kate.
Forgive me, Thomasin.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.840
What is this?

43:53.440 --> 43:56.364
Katherine, I must make confession.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.970
I yestermorn took Caleb
to the wood.

44:06.120 --> 44:09.647
Twas for food,
and the pelts for money, good money.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.722
I knew you were false!
I knew it!

44:11.800 --> 44:14.326
I meant it as a surprise,
that is why I kept secret.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.970
I will trap that wolf, Kate.

44:16.040 --> 44:18.008
You stood by whilst our son lied to me!

44:18.080 --> 44:19.923
Twas for thy sake!
I love thee, Kate.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.571
- You took him to the woods!
- I will find him!

44:22.680 --> 44:24.569
You've broken God's covenant.
You're a liar.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.330
And you've lost another child.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.926
- I will go now.
- You cannot escape the woods.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.525
I Will find him!

44:30.600 --> 44:34.127
And kill thyself too?
Will Jonas be the man of the house?

44:34.200 --> 44:36.202
Will you damn all your family to death?!

44:36.280 --> 44:38.726
- Katherine!
- Let go of me!

44:41.280 --> 44:45.046
[crying]

44:51.120 --> 44:52.963
Picking apples.

45:01.680 --> 45:06.049
Mother, have the goats
been bedded down yet?

45:06.120 --> 45:08.361
- Nay.
<i>- I'll</i> to it.

45:08.440 --> 45:13.287
Let it wait til the morrow.
They dare not escape with this rain.

45:13.360 --> 45:15.249
[Thomasin]
Nay, I'll to it.

45:15.320 --> 45:18.210
Please you, Mother.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.203
Come hither, child.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.010
Hurry back.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.522
[humming]

45:55.240 --> 45:57.242
[rustling]

46:17.320 --> 46:18.765
[gasps]

46:19.640 --> 46:21.961
Caleb...

46:22.080 --> 46:24.208
[breathing heavily]

46:25.040 --> 46:26.405
Father!

46:26.480 --> 46:27.970
Caleb, Caleb...

46:54.560 --> 46:57.803
Shh.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.563
[Katherine]
Oh, merciful Father,

47:38.640 --> 47:41.325
both the Lord and giver of life.

47:41.400 --> 47:45.200
Thy sole, Jesus Christ,
we beseech thee.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.282
Look down from Heaven upon him

47:47.360 --> 47:50.284
with those eyes
of grace and compassion.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.044
Pity thy wounded servant...

47:52.120 --> 47:54.122
[rain falling]

48:26.840 --> 48:32.131
Baa,baa.Baa,baa,baa.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.771
What ails Caleb, Black Phillip?
What ails him?

48:34.840 --> 48:37.411
Did Thomasin make 'im sick
in the wood?

48:37.480 --> 48:38.766
What say you?

48:38.840 --> 48:40.808
Black Phillip says you are wicked.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.445
Aye, he told me too.

48:42.520 --> 48:43.806
Damn your Black Phillip.

48:43.920 --> 48:48.244
He says you put the Devil
in Caleb, that's why he's sick.

48:48.360 --> 48:52.001
I'd never hurt Caleb,
nor Sam, nor thee.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.923
- You beat me.
- T'was a jest.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.650
- You said you'd eat of me.
- Mercy!

48:55.720 --> 48:57.210
Mother and Father will find out.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.851
- What?
- That you are a witch!

48:59.920 --> 49:01.763
[goats bleat]

49:01.840 --> 49:04.491
Thomasin!

49:04.840 --> 49:06.490
Thomasin?

49:06.560 --> 49:07.846
[Splash]

49:10.680 --> 49:12.125
[Splash]

49:28.880 --> 49:31.531
[praying softly]

49:44.360 --> 49:46.840
Dost remember John Kempe's son?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.367
That first winter, he was
tormented of Indian magic.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.249
<i>“Us not the same.</i>

49:51.320 --> 49:55.530
- This is unnatural providence.
- I know not that.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.841
Look at thy son.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.250
- Will.
- What?

50:00.320 --> 50:01.890
- Think!
- Think what?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.970
- Think!
- I have no thoughts.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.202
Does this not look
like witchcraft?

50:07.280 --> 50:08.850
What witch?

50:10.040 --> 50:12.202
Who does this then? Who?

50:13.160 --> 50:15.527
Thy thoughts are as a child.

50:22.200 --> 50:23.725
What are you doing?

50:24.720 --> 50:27.849
We'll back to the plantation
in the morning.

50:27.960 --> 50:32.124
Find a good family for Thomasin,
take Caleb to the doctor's.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.202
He'll tell if this be
some natural ill or not.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.170
Yet we cannot
return as beggars.

50:40.240 --> 50:44.723
I'll scour the field. There must be
some fruit yet untouched by this rot.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.724
I beseech thee, Katherine,
what canst thou do for him presently?

50:47.800 --> 50:50.804
How might we all bare it
to the village with no horse?

50:50.880 --> 50:53.565
Well, the little corn and the goat
should fetch a fair price.

50:53.640 --> 50:56.041
We'll... We'll back with Caleb
and sell them,

50:56.120 --> 50:58.122
return with the horse
for the twins and Thomasin.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.641
- You cannot leave them here!
- Thomasin and thee...

51:00.720 --> 51:02.370
Oh, forget the crop, Will!

51:02.440 --> 51:04.488
What?!

51:04.560 --> 51:07.370
What dost thou want, Katherine?

51:08.360 --> 51:10.966
Tell me and I will give it thee.

51:13.840 --> 51:16.525
I want to be home.

51:18.120 --> 51:20.885
Thou shall be home,
by candle-time tomorrow.

51:20.960 --> 51:23.406
In England.

51:26.120 --> 51:29.090
[Katherine sobs and sighs]

51:29.600 --> 51:32.251
Oh, Will...

51:32.320 --> 51:35.085
I also have a confession to make.

51:36.840 --> 51:39.605
I never meant to be a shrew to thee.

51:40.280 --> 51:41.691
<i>[sobs]</i>

51:41.760 --> 51:45.207
I have become as Job's wife,
I know it.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.720
<i>[sobs]</i>

51:47.800 --> 51:49.529
But since Sam, since...

51:53.760 --> 51:56.445
My heart has turned to stone.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.251
[Sigh]

52:03.480 --> 52:09.044
I dreamed once,
t'was when I was of Thomasin's years,

52:09.120 --> 52:12.602
that I was with Christ upon Earth.

52:14.160 --> 52:17.642
Oh, I was so very near Him.

52:17.720 --> 52:22.442
And in many tears for the assurance
of the pardon of me sins.

52:22.520 --> 52:26.650
And I was so ravaged
with His love towards me,

52:26.720 --> 52:31.169
I thought it far exceeding
the affection of the kindest husband.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.761
And since Samuel disappeared...

52:37.600 --> 52:41.889
...I have such a sad weakness
of faith, I cannot shake it.

52:41.960 --> 52:45.487
I cannot see Christ's help as near.

52:45.560 --> 52:48.769
I pray and I pray, but I cannot.

52:51.240 --> 52:56.007
I fear I cannot ever feel
that same measure of love again.

53:02.160 --> 53:04.891
Thou shall have of it in Heaven.

53:08.760 --> 53:11.604
I'll be in field.

53:11.680 --> 53:14.524
If you can spare a while, do.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.284
We'll leave at dawn.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.124
I promise thee that.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.320
Jonas, Mercy, come hither!

53:27.560 --> 53:29.369
Speak not a word!

53:40.400 --> 53:42.402
<i>[Mercy]
Black Phillip is</i> a <i>merry, merry king</i>

53:42.480 --> 53:45.086
<i>- He rules the land with mirth...

53:45.240 --> 53:46.969

<i>- Sing bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

53:54.600 --> 53:56.364
Mercy. Thomasin.

<i>[Mercy]
Sing bah, bah, King Phillip, the black</i>

53:58.440 --> 54:00.169

[scream]

54:04.840 --> 54:06.171
Come.

54:10.240 --> 54:12.971
Get the broadaxe
and cut off her head.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.203
Get the narrow axe
and cut off her head.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.760
Get the broadaxe
and cut off her head.

54:18.840 --> 54:21.127
Get the narrow axe
and cut off her head.

54:21.240 --> 54:23.811
[gasps]

54:23.880 --> 54:25.564
She's upon me!

54:25.640 --> 54:27.085
She kneels!

54:27.200 --> 54:28.725
My bowels!

54:28.800 --> 54:31.041
My stomach!

54:31.160 --> 54:32.525
She pinches!

54:32.680 --> 54:35.604
[yelling indistinct]

54:35.680 --> 54:39.605
Sin! Sin! Sin!!

54:39.680 --> 54:42.160
Thomasin, take the children outside.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.965
What does this to thee?
What does this?

54:47.880 --> 54:50.008
His mouth has sealed up.

54:52.600 --> 54:54.887
Oh, God, William!

54:54.960 --> 54:57.122
William! Get him up!

54:57.200 --> 54:58.645
Hold him!

Thomasin, help!

55:03.960 --> 55:06.281
[William grunting]

55:06.360 --> 55:08.044
You'll break his jaws.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.409
-'Tis she!
- No!

55:29.480 --> 55:31.767
- What horrible fancy is this?
- She told me she stole Sam!

55:31.840 --> 55:33.285
SHence!

55:33.360 --> 55:34.691
She gave him to the Devil

- Theyue!
'What Say you?

55:36.320 --> 55:37.970
She turned Flora's milk to blood!

55:38.040 --> 55:39.644
She had bade us
keep secret from you!

55:39.720 --> 55:42.769
- It was but a jest to quiet her, I--
- She made bargain with Satan!

55:42.840 --> 55:44.444
- She signed his book!
- Silence!

Don't let her near me!
She'll put a curse on me!

Nay, I'll not hear it.

Love you prayer?

Get up!

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.961
This tree will be
lovely come spring.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.361
Do you remember
when we came hither?

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.681
Such a pretty tree.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.126
Next year I'll just own us
a wheat field.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.924
Start it at this tree
and end it thither.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.446
We'd have been a proper farm then.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.441
Brought us a big fat milk cow,
finished us the barn.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.326
You must tell me, Thomasin.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.729
Tomorrow I cannot keep secret of this.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.406
The council will be called
and thy life is--

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.881
- Thy life--
- Will you not believe me?

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.884
I saw The Serpent in my son.
You stopped their prayer, Thom--

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.726
- They lie!
- I saw it.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.849
Caleb disappeared with thee.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.402
- I love Caleb.
- And who then found him,

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.090
pale as death,

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.289
naked as sin and witch'd?

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.641
Thomasin, listen to me.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.882
The bargain that was made
is of no effect.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.122
- I made no bargain.
- Thy soul belongeth to Christ.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.891
- I made no bargain.
- The Devil hath no interest in thee.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.521
- I am no witch, father.
- What did I but see in my house?

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.887
- Will you not hear me?
- Prithee, confess.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.843
Why have you turned against me?

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.169
Christ can un-witch us
if you will but speak truth to me.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.881
As I love thee, speak truth.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.851
- You ask me to speak truth?
- I beg thee.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.049
You and Mother planned
to rid the farm of me.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.442
Aye, I heard you speak of it.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.522
Is that truth?

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.844
You took of Mother's cup
and let her rail at me.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.321
You confessed not
till it was too late.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.402
- Is that truth?
- Peace thee.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.766
- I will not.
- I am thy father.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.003
- You are a hypocrite!
- Hold thy tongue, daughter mine.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.890
You took Caleb to the wood and let me
take the blame of that too.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.689
Is that truth?

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.044
You let Mother be as thy master.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.851
You cannot bring the crops to yield!
You cannot hunt!

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.649
- Is that truth enough?
- Enough.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.768
Thou canst do nothing
save cut wood!

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.080

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.481

wag his tongue in thy mouth?

Go on, ask them!

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.526
They spend all day long
babbling to that horned beast.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.840
They know well his voice.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.251
Go to.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:38.688
The Adversary oft comes
in the shape of a he-goat.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.644
And whispers.
Aye, whispers!

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.482
He is Lucifer.
You know it.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.801
- The twins know it too.
- Slander thy brethren no more.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.010
- It is they!
- From my sight!

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.082
T'was they and that goat
what bewitched this whole farm.

Was't a wolf stole Sam?

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.051
I never saw no wolf.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.929
Mercy told me herself
by the stream,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.480
"I be the Witch of the Wood."

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.324
- You killed my children!
- No!

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.370
You killed thy father!
You witch!

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.522
I love you! I love you!

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.531
[screams]

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.490
[gasping]

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.524
[moans]

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.809
[muffled screams]

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.723
[crying]

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.245
[gasping]

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.681
[sobbing]

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.771
[birds chirping]

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.489
[chimes]

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:12.684
Black Phillip,
I conjure thee to speak to me.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.290
Speak as thou doth speak
to Jonas and Mercy.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.651
Dost thou understand
my English tongue?

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.648
Answer me.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.320
[Black Phillip]
What dost thou want?

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.160
What canst thou give?

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:04.728
[Black Phillip] Wouldst thou like
the taste of butter?

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.882
A pretty dress?

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.090
Wouldst thou like
to live deliciously?

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.964
Yes.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:22.288
[Black Phillip]
Wouldst thou like to see the world?

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.329
What will you from me?

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.200
[Black Phillip]
Dost thou see a book before thee?

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.010
[chimes]

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.967
Remove thy shift.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.002
I cannot write my name.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.043
[Black Phillip]
I will guide thy hand.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.643
[whispering]

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.291
[chanting]
