00:01.190 --> 00:02.910
Previously on damages:

00:02.930 --> 00:04.400
Patty's talked a lot about her son,

00:04.440 --> 00:06.760
but she's never once
mentioned who his father is.

00:06.790 --> 00:09.160
So,you think he's purcell's kid?

00:09.180 --> 00:10.560
I always wanted a son.

00:10.590 --> 00:12.800
I just didn't know I actually had one.

00:12.830 --> 00:15.410
You were found with your wife's body.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.640
There's no sign of forced entry.

00:17.660 --> 00:20.250
Her ring. She's not wearing it.

00:20.260 --> 00:23.510
You find that ring,and
you find my wife's killer.

00:23.890 --> 00:26.550
I have no idea whether
daniel killed his wife,

00:26.570 --> 00:31.490
but his consulting firm has worked
for unr for more than a decade.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.430
Whatever you dragged our company into,

00:33.470 --> 00:36.200
it better not involve anything other
than retrieving stolen documents.

00:36.230 --> 00:40.090
This company is killing people,and
that's the guy who calls the shots.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.450
Walter kendrick,ceo.

00:42.480 --> 00:46.730
Unr is making record profits
using toxic chemicals.

00:46.740 --> 00:49.570
There's a reporter you need to meet.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.200
Josh reston. Do you mind me
asking where you get your water?

00:52.210 --> 00:54.810
Do you think it's contaminated
from the coal plant?

00:54.840 --> 00:57.110
Ultima national is bulletproof.

00:57.130 --> 00:59.770
Represent me,and I'll
tell you everything.

01:24.610 --> 01:26.410
Daniel.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.190
I'll be right there.

01:30.330 --> 01:32.620
Please,daniel.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.240
Almost finished.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.550
You're missing all the fun.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.770
Daniel.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.230
Daniel,come play with me.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.190
- Christine!
- Please,danny?

02:11.600 --> 02:13.440
Daniel?

02:13.630 --> 02:14.680
Christine?

02:14.690 --> 02:17.270
Danny,come play with me.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.010
I can't get it out.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.340
- Please,danny.
- Christine!

02:26.350 --> 02:28.550
You're missing all the fun.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.350
Danny,please. Daniel... daniel!

02:31.360 --> 02:33.590
- You're missing all the fun.
- Christine!

02:33.600 --> 02:35.260
Daniel,daniel...

02:35.270 --> 02:40.070
Purcell. Purcell,let's go.

02:43.070 --> 02:47.500
Daniel purcell told me about
a reporter in west virginia.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.600
Now that he's in jail,he's
suddenly cooperating?

02:49.630 --> 02:52.380
Yeah,being framed for his
wife's murder changed his mind.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.710
What's the reporter's name?

02:53.720 --> 02:55.910
Josh reston.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.200
This is what I have on him.

02:57.220 --> 03:01.010
He thinks that ultima national resources
is poisoning people with aracite.

03:01.020 --> 03:03.090
Unfortunately,we can't find him.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.010
You think ultima national got to him?

03:05.030 --> 03:06.920
I don't know...

03:06.940 --> 03:09.390
but tom's arranging for
travel down to west virginia.

03:09.410 --> 03:12.520
You both leave for
the airport in an hour.

03:13.100 --> 03:17.110
Patty,we still haven't proven
that unr killed purcell's wife.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.530
I'd rather stay here and work on that.

03:19.570 --> 03:23.160
If we're going after ultima
national,we need josh reston.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.930
You and tom are going to find him.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.780
I'll pack a bag.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.510
And ellen...

03:31.520 --> 03:36.040
the next time I give you an assignment,just
nod your head and get it done.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.150
{\a6}5 MONTHS LATER

03:51.185 --> 03:53.540
Come in. Have a seat.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.680
Is that the money?

04:00.380 --> 04:03.450
Are you sure you're okay?
You seem a little worried.

05:03.460 --> 05:06.370
And I have three neighbors who
heard your client loud and clear.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.370
But mr. Purcell's neighbors weren't
aware of the context of his remarks.

05:10.390 --> 05:11.930
You mean your client
yelling,"I'll kill you,"

05:11.960 --> 05:14.190
at 2:00 A.M.A week before
his wife was murdered?

05:14.210 --> 05:17.260
It's not my job to decide
context. That's for a jury.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.520
He was threatening an intruder.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.620
Daniel purcell did not kill his wife.

05:22.630 --> 05:25.080
You also have the police
report he filed that night?

05:25.110 --> 05:30.230
I do,as well as the restraining order the victim
filed against your client for physical abuse.

05:30.250 --> 05:33.390
The district attorney's office
is building a strong case.

05:33.420 --> 05:37.160
If you're angling for
a plea,now is the time.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.840
I'm not.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.500
There's exculpatory evidence
that is being ignored.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.330
You mean the diamond
ring that wasn't stolen?

05:44.360 --> 05:48.470
Oh,no,you must mean the ruby ring that
only mr. Purcell seems to know about.

05:49.090 --> 05:51.550
This doesn't have to be adversarial.

05:51.580 --> 05:55.670
In fact,some of my best friends
are plaintiffs' attorneys.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.300
I have plenty of friends.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.270
Find the ring.

06:00.310 --> 06:02.960
And if you don't,I will.

06:03.430 --> 06:07.200
My boss is giving five grand
to anyone who finds this.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.440
Photo's from an insurance appraisal.

06:09.450 --> 06:10.850
****

06:10.860 --> 06:14.620
The ring could have been fenced,or it
could have been sold to the usual spots.

06:14.660 --> 06:17.660
Use your contacts,but
don't run your mouths.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.230
You find it,you tell me and me only.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.530
Hey,sweetheart.

06:31.210 --> 06:33.470
Come here. Come here,honey.

06:38.290 --> 06:41.330
- This all you got for that ring?
- That's it.

06:42.190 --> 06:44.350
- $300?
- I swear. That's all I got.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.810
You're a goddamned liar,kevin.
You swore to me $450.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.870
I owe $480,and that's not
even all the doctor bills.

06:50.890 --> 06:53.160
You got to be patient,liza.
There's more coming. I promise you.

06:53.170 --> 06:56.310
- I've been patient,kevin!
- Liza.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.390
Always the same shit with you.

07:19.630 --> 07:22.920
I've been thinking about you
every minute of every day.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.140
Hey,patty.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.070
Dad,are you ever gonna come home?

07:47.270 --> 07:52.480
Erica,the police made a very bad
mistake when they arrested your father.

07:52.490 --> 07:56.290
I am doing everything I can to
make sure he comes home to you.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.120
Okay.

07:59.780 --> 08:04.090
Are there any leads on the stolen ring?

08:04.100 --> 08:07.070
No. Still looking.

08:07.460 --> 08:13.880
But,daniel,if you're right and they're
using aracite down in west virginia,

08:14.750 --> 08:18.410
there is a case to try
against ultima national.

08:18.420 --> 08:19.980
Made contact with that journalist?

08:20.020 --> 08:22.900
No,he won't answer our phone calls.

08:23.190 --> 08:27.080
He's a kid. He's scared.

08:28.150 --> 08:30.940
Well,he has a reason to be.

08:30.950 --> 08:33.240
Unr has everything to lose.

08:33.260 --> 08:36.570
He's the one who knows
what's going on down there.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.730
You got to find him.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.380
My people are on their way down
to west virginia as we speak.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.800
Awesome,there's 17
stations of bluegrass.

08:53.840 --> 08:57.360
That's not,uh,bluegrass,actually.
That's,uh,old-time country.

08:57.370 --> 09:01.380
- Oh,please.
- What? There is A...

09:01.700 --> 09:03.220
there's a difference.

09:03.250 --> 09:07.960
Old-time country,the background
instruments,you know,accompany the melody.

09:07.970 --> 09:09.210
Really.

09:09.250 --> 09:14.890
And in bluegrass,each instrument takes its
turn playing the melody and improvising off it.

09:14.930 --> 09:18.140
I'm just trying to educate you.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.460
- You're fascinating.
- Thank you.

09:19.470 --> 09:22.680
- You are a fascinating man.
- It's true.

09:22.690 --> 09:25.170
- There's a difference.
- You know,I'M...

09:26.000 --> 09:30.920
I'm totally lost. I have no
idea where this motel is at all.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.600
This map is...

09:35.320 --> 09:37.420
Do you see that?

09:52.970 --> 09:54.870
Jesus.

09:55.630 --> 09:57.800
What is that smell?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.600
What the hell is going on down here?

10:12.470 --> 10:15.940
Goddamn,that's just about long
enough to measure my manhood.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.280
Took the family to scotland last year.

10:19.540 --> 10:21.930
Played carnoustie.

10:21.940 --> 10:23.410
Brutal course.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.800
The scots invented the
game of golf,you know.

10:25.840 --> 10:30.220
Yeah,some hunchback prick in
a kilt hit a rock with a stick.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.770
Now it's a $40 billion business.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.090
How we doing,donny?

10:42.310 --> 10:43.880
this can't be good.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.690
That kid we found on the
property a few days back?

10:46.720 --> 10:48.640
Turns out he's a local reporter.

10:48.670 --> 10:51.800
Does the name joshua reston
mean anything to you,mr. Suttry?

10:51.840 --> 10:52.540
Should it?

10:52.580 --> 10:56.340
Well,apparently the kid's been in phone
contact with one of your employees.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.900
- Who's that?
- Daniel purcell.

10:59.550 --> 11:01.060
Purcell is under control.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.390
Good,'cause we've got another problem.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.510
We were reviewing surveillance
footage of the north compound.

11:06.530 --> 11:09.620
Seems like the reporter
took a water sample.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.910
Runoff from the building 3 processor.

11:15.420 --> 11:18.010
What should I do about the sample?

11:19.230 --> 11:21.310
Mr. Kendrick?

11:22.780 --> 11:25.010
Get it back.

11:27.580 --> 11:32.180
Patty,we found the ring,and I think
we got a lead on the guy who pawned it.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.360
Can you get it to me in an hour?

11:34.380 --> 11:37.660
Yeah,okay. You want me
to bring it by the office?

11:37.670 --> 11:39.340
Yeah.

11:49.190 --> 11:51.160
Mr. Reston?

11:51.540 --> 11:53.610
You home?

11:53.920 --> 11:54.710
anything?

11:54.720 --> 11:57.280
No,they're saying the
phone's off the hook.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.620
Josh?

12:16.590 --> 12:19.420
Looks like someone got to him before us.

12:25.390 --> 12:30.430
Mr. Purcell told you the ring
was stolen from the crime scene.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.810
We bought it from the
owner of the pawn shop.

12:37.830 --> 12:41.110
That picture was taken
by his security camera.

12:44.950 --> 12:48.590
That's the man who
killed christine purcell.

12:50.230 --> 12:54.710
Just because a blond guy pawns her ring
doesn't necessarily mean he killed her.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.990
You really want to bring
that argument into court?

13:00.800 --> 13:02.890
I'll look into this.

13:08.300 --> 13:12.170
You know,I've been doing
this for 26 years,and...

13:12.850 --> 13:15.520
I want to believe mr. Purcell.

13:17.940 --> 13:20.080
But I just can'T.

13:41.510 --> 13:43.630
- How you doing,kevin?
- I've been better.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.190
Ain't we all?

13:45.880 --> 13:48.220
How's that pretty little girl of yours?

13:49.180 --> 13:51.050
- What the hell?
- Open the register.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.980
- How much you need?
- All of it!

14:13.630 --> 14:16.120
I'd say it's just A...

14:16.140 --> 14:18.690
a basic fear of mortality.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.250
- Really?
- Totally.

14:21.260 --> 14:26.090
In your dream,it's a black-tie event,and
you show up wearing a white suit?

14:26.100 --> 14:28.760
- Right.
- Face it,phil.

14:28.770 --> 14:31.720
That's got fear of death
written all over it.

14:32.010 --> 14:36.830
Or maybe I'm just trying to inject
a little whimsy into the proceedings.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.430
Maybe not.

14:38.470 --> 14:43.400
Or maybe I'm going to dazzle the
crowd with my john travolta impression.

14:43.430 --> 14:46.020
In pulp fiction he wore black.

14:46.050 --> 14:49.020
Yes,but in saturday night fever...

14:49.040 --> 14:50.940
Never saw it.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.780
10 YEARS EARLIER

15:01.310 --> 15:03.390
You filed for custody?

15:03.420 --> 15:05.350
You can't ask me to ignore my son.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.510
I explained to you why
he's not ready for this.

15:08.530 --> 15:12.960
All I want to do is see
him,and I'm tired of asking.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.500
So you're taking legal action?

15:14.540 --> 15:17.030
Is there anything else you understand?

15:17.680 --> 15:20.200
You don't want to pursue this in court.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.370
Why not?

15:23.040 --> 15:25.430
Because I'll destroy you.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.860
Well,things are looking good.

15:42.130 --> 15:45.000
They found christine's ring.

15:46.520 --> 15:52.210
I need an attorney to redraft my will,

15:52.220 --> 15:54.610
get my estate in order.

15:56.130 --> 15:59.100
I'm going to get you out of here.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.250
Christine refused to
talk about the future.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.090
She denied its existence.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.530
It was fear.

16:21.840 --> 16:27.060
She shut down after she saw
what her father went through.

16:29.700 --> 16:32.590
I'll get you an estate attorney.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.890
Erica was the first baby I ever held.

16:45.450 --> 16:48.670
I was always uncomfortable
with everybody else'S.

16:51.570 --> 16:58.200
And then christine put
my baby girl in my arms,

16:59.010 --> 17:02.680
and I felt it instantly.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.480
I would die for her.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.410
You listen to me,all right?

17:24.420 --> 17:27.000
I'm gonna get you out of here.

17:32.940 --> 17:34.810
Thanks,chuck.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.830
We were hoping you could tell us where
we might be able to find josh reston.

17:39.860 --> 17:42.420
Is he still one of your reporters?

17:42.430 --> 17:45.710
I sent him to cover a
mountaineer game in morgantown.

17:45.740 --> 17:47.190
Woman's basketball.

17:47.220 --> 17:49.100
They're squaring off against fairfield.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.530
Should be one heck of a contest.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.240
We've been calling his cell phone
for three days. He's not answering.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.030
I don't know why that would be.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.610
Well,maybe you can help
us with something else.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.310
Shoot.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.990
Josh was researching
livestock mortality rates.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.300
Yes,he was.

18:06.330 --> 18:07.770
You're the editor of the paper.

18:07.780 --> 18:11.640
Why haven't you published
any of those articles?

18:12.220 --> 18:17.320
Josh was trying to connect ultima national's
coal processing with farms being wiped out.

18:17.790 --> 18:20.970
I just didn't think he had
the research to back that up.

18:20.980 --> 18:24.030
Mr. Donohue,we went to josh's place.

18:24.070 --> 18:28.070
It was ransacked. Someone must
think that he's on the right track.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.660
I-I don't know anything about that.

18:35.010 --> 18:38.720
And I don't believe you that
he's at a basketball game.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.960
I'm sorry.

18:54.920 --> 19:00.770
Josh is a smart kid and he tries
hard,but he is dead wrong about this one.

19:04.070 --> 19:06.530
You two be careful down here.

19:18.210 --> 19:20.300
Detective! Detective!

19:20.720 --> 19:21.770
You're not going to believe this.

19:21.810 --> 19:24.140
I think this is the
guy you're looking for.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.030
Picked up for armed robbery?

19:26.050 --> 19:29.800
Robbed his own cousin,and get
this: He had a pawn ticket on him.

19:44.730 --> 19:46.540
I know you're drinking light these days.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.310
Thanks,chuck.

19:48.340 --> 19:50.250
I heard you got some news for me.

19:50.270 --> 19:54.010
Yeah,there were a couple of
suits in here from new york.

19:54.040 --> 19:57.850
They were talking to lester donohue,asking
questions about that reporter.

19:58.150 --> 20:00.270
You catch their names?

20:00.970 --> 20:04.790
No,but I asked around and,um,they're
staying at the green inn.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.220
Just thought mr. Kendrick should know.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.290
No,come on,man,you know
beer's on the house.

20:09.310 --> 20:12.880
No,that's not for the
drink,chuck. You're a good man.

20:21.090 --> 20:22.750
we found the guy.

20:23.660 --> 20:24.680
How?

20:24.720 --> 20:29.300
He was,uh,picked up for armed robbery
and,uh,he had a pawn ticket on him.

20:29.310 --> 20:31.080
His name is kevin walker.

20:31.090 --> 20:33.730
Does he match mr. Purcell's description?

20:34.730 --> 20:36.700
Yes.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.840
I know. I was wrong.

20:41.690 --> 20:43.870
that's why I came in person.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.510
Well,I can respect that,detective.

20:47.890 --> 20:50.120
We'll want a lineup.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.770
- I'll arrange it.
- Good.

21:02.270 --> 21:04.980
Can I see number four in profile?

21:04.990 --> 21:06.820
- His right side?
- Certainly.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.520
I saw him in profile as he went by me.

21:09.530 --> 21:12.550
Number four,step forward. Turn left.

21:17.770 --> 21:22.000
No. No,that's not him.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.920
Step back. Thank you.

21:55.070 --> 21:56.700
Number five.

21:56.720 --> 22:00.080
Number five,step forward. Turn left.

22:09.270 --> 22:11.590
Do you recognize him?

22:13.620 --> 22:15.880
Mr. Purcell?

22:16.330 --> 22:18.150
That's him.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.280
That'S... that's the guy.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.290
What's for dinner?

22:58.760 --> 23:01.550
A cider-braised pork shoulder.

23:01.570 --> 23:03.910
Tell me how a gal like
you doesn't have a husband.

23:03.930 --> 23:06.580
Uh,maybe because i don't want one.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.920
I assume you've been following
the situation on daniel purcell.

23:14.120 --> 23:18.260
The asshole leaks our aracite documents,then
turns around and kills his wife.

23:18.300 --> 23:21.140
No,mr. Purcell was released from jail.

23:21.150 --> 23:25.630
And I think wayne suttry had
something to do with the murder.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.550
That's quite an accusation.

23:28.580 --> 23:30.680
- You can back this up?
- No.

23:30.690 --> 23:33.620
But my legal advice is
to eliminate exposure.

23:33.900 --> 23:36.680
I want you to cut all ties with suttry.

23:38.070 --> 23:40.040
Okay.

23:40.050 --> 23:43.900
And I have to ask.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.080
Did we have anything
to do with the murder?

23:47.750 --> 23:50.780
Come on,claire. Absolutely not.

23:53.590 --> 23:56.310
You said you had news.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.150
I do,mr. Suttry.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.840
Our guy's been arrested.

24:02.210 --> 24:04.670
Kevin walker?

24:05.850 --> 24:07.650
Is purcell still in jail?

24:07.680 --> 24:10.890
No,he's been released.

24:15.470 --> 24:17.380
Stop staring.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.850
You're making her nervous.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.870
Do you have instructions for me?

24:25.880 --> 24:30.670
I respond... to instructions.

24:32.110 --> 24:34.110
Drive out to attica.

24:34.130 --> 24:36.960
Mr. Kendrick wants you
to thank mr. Walker.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.090
Keep me posted.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.880
There's definitely a
case down here,patty.

24:44.910 --> 24:47.240
Everything's consistent
with purcell's story.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.780
The only problem is,still
can't find the kid.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.230
So just give us a call when you can.

24:55.010 --> 24:56.750
Mr. Pibb.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.350
I'll see you in the morning.

25:05.610 --> 25:07.730
Mr. Pibb...

25:12.340 --> 25:14.640
ah,shit.

25:19.710 --> 25:22.160
They're out of mr. Pibb!

25:24.060 --> 25:26.970
- I heard you were looking for me.
- Josh?

25:27.670 --> 25:29.990
Can we talk somewhere safe?

25:33.570 --> 25:36.880
So after you spoke to my
editor,he looked into your firm.

25:37.340 --> 25:40.740
Found out you were
representing daniel purcell.

25:40.750 --> 25:42.610
How did you contact purcell?

25:42.620 --> 25:46.320
About a month ago,he sent me a fax
after he read one of my obituaries.

25:46.330 --> 25:48.600
- An obituary?
- Yeah.

25:48.610 --> 25:53.380
One of the county's largest hog farmers hanged
himself after his whole stock got wiped out.

25:53.390 --> 25:57.320
Mr. Purcell thought he knew
what was killing the animals.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.730
When we first got here,there
were fires alongside the road.

25:59.740 --> 26:01.560
And there was A... there was a smell.

26:01.570 --> 26:03.600
Yeah,that's the,uh,dead livestock.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.160
They burn them at night.

26:05.170 --> 26:11.840
Draw a circle around the county,and every quarter
mile closer you get to ultima's facilities,

26:12.090 --> 26:15.730
there's a 30% increase
in livestock fatalities.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.170
Can you prove that?

26:17.190 --> 26:19.340
Yeah,I've got the research.

26:19.390 --> 26:21.440
But it's not only affecting livestock.

26:21.480 --> 26:26.140
Leukemia rates around here are
145% above the national average.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.880
And anyone who speaks
out against them...

26:28.890 --> 26:30.740
anyonepeho saks out
against them gets siNced.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.480
That's why we're down here.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.470
We want to bring a suit against unr.

26:34.500 --> 26:37.390
Do you know anyone who'd be
willing to serve as a plaintiff?

26:38.450 --> 26:40.290
No. No.

26:40.580 --> 26:43.930
But if somebody steps forward,they're
going to need protection.

26:44.460 --> 26:46.340
Well,we can provide that.

26:46.370 --> 26:49.350
- We can provide it for you,too.
- I'm fine.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.760
We stopped by your house.
It was trashed pretty good.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.390
Yeah,I saw them pulling up.

26:54.420 --> 26:57.090
I ran out the back,but I don't
think they were coming for me.

26:57.130 --> 26:58.080
What do you mean?

26:58.110 --> 27:01.820
Well,last week,I snuck onto the
company's property,took a couple pictures.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.450
A couple of the workers knocked
me around and stole my camera.

27:04.470 --> 27:06.680
But there's something they didn't take.

27:06.690 --> 27:08.670
What is that?

27:18.650 --> 27:21.730
This is runoff from
the unr cold processor.

27:22.250 --> 27:25.430
We're going to want to get this
to our boss back in new york.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.600
*****

27:44.500 --> 27:46.630
You got something for me?

27:47.210 --> 27:49.350
A job.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.030
What is it?

27:51.060 --> 27:53.170
It's simple.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.610
I want you to deliver a message.

28:25.150 --> 28:27.200
What are you working on?

28:27.220 --> 28:29.830
Rewriting my college essay.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.050
- How's that going?
- Fine.

28:38.370 --> 28:41.430
Let me know if you want
another set of eyes.

28:42.180 --> 28:45.390
Thanks. Phil already offered.

28:50.610 --> 28:53.720
Michael,I'd like to talk
to you about something.

29:00.690 --> 29:03.690
Did your associates
ever find the reporter?

29:03.990 --> 29:08.280
Yeah. And he has a water
sample from unr property.

29:08.690 --> 29:14.940
If that tests positive for aracite,that
could change the whole game.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.390
Will you test it?

29:18.400 --> 29:21.180
Yes. Absolutely.

29:21.190 --> 29:24.530
I've already filed a
complaint with the court.

29:24.550 --> 29:29.060
Our next step is a motion
to expedite discovery.

29:29.450 --> 29:31.430
Okay.

29:32.470 --> 29:36.390
Now,in order for us to win that motion,

29:36.400 --> 29:39.380
we'll need you to testify
that aracite is toxic,

29:39.400 --> 29:43.350
and that unr knowingly
ignored your warnings.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.320
These people killed my wife,patty.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.320
I'll do whatever you need me to.

30:01.360 --> 30:05.040
Daniel,this might not be the right time,

30:05.080 --> 30:09.510
but there may never be the "right" time.

30:10.040 --> 30:14.500
I've... I've talked it
over with my husband and...

30:15.090 --> 30:20.620
we decided that it was best for
us to tell michael about you.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.340
He knows everything.

30:25.370 --> 30:30.920
And if it's,if it's all right
with you,he'd like to meet you.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.820
Thank you,patty.

30:40.910 --> 30:43.810
I'd like that very much.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.880
A little weird.

31:59.050 --> 32:02.830
I believe daniel purcell's wife

32:02.840 --> 32:07.480
may have been murdered to protect the
secrets of a major energy corporation.

32:07.490 --> 32:12.240
Kevin walker was identified in a
lineup,and then he confessed to the murder.

32:12.250 --> 32:14.860
- Yes,but look at his record.
- He had four priors.

32:14.870 --> 32:17.730
Misdemeanors. All for heroin possession.

32:17.740 --> 32:20.120
Murder is way out of his league.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.540
Your client's a free man,ms. Hewes.

32:22.550 --> 32:23.960
Go home. Be happy.

32:23.970 --> 32:29.600
All I'm saying-- if kevin walker murdered
christine purcell,he didn't act alone.

32:29.960 --> 32:33.340
There's something much
bigger going on here.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.490
Kevin walker?

32:44.840 --> 32:46.600
Yeah,yeah.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.070
I talked to your guy,man.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.420
Has my family been taken care of?

32:50.450 --> 32:53.830
Yeah,they're doing great,man.
Brand new condo in yonkers,bro.

32:53.840 --> 32:57.550
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

33:01.860 --> 33:05.390
Sorry,man. I got a family,too,you know.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.170
This is them.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.090
What's going on now?

33:33.740 --> 33:36.280
This is the road to the
airport. You headed out of town?

33:36.970 --> 33:38.990
Just going for a drive,sir.

33:39.010 --> 33:41.710
Can you open up the back for me,please?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.240
Why would I want to do that?

33:43.260 --> 33:46.170
We have reason to believe you're
in possession of stolen property.

33:46.910 --> 33:49.260
Really?

33:49.630 --> 33:52.000
Step out of the car,please,sir.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.750
step aside,please.

34:10.330 --> 34:12.020
- You know you can't do this.
- Do what?

34:12.030 --> 34:14.230
Illegal search and seizure.

34:15.960 --> 34:19.139
We know you two are in
possession of stolen property.

34:21.340 --> 34:23.570
Now where's the goddamn water?

34:23.590 --> 34:25.739
What's the problem,officer?

34:29.190 --> 34:30.110
Where's tom?

34:30.130 --> 34:32.969
We split up. He's still down
there looking for a plaintiff.

34:32.980 --> 34:35.889
- Did you get a sample?
- Yeah.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.190
Nice work.

34:39.230 --> 34:44.230
Whatever ultima national is dumping in that
water-- entire farms are being wiped out.

34:44.239 --> 34:46.130
People are getting sick now,too.

34:46.159 --> 34:51.020
Well,daniel's agreed to analyze
this and to testify against unr.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.949
I've scheduled a hearing.

34:52.969 --> 34:54.570
What about his original report?

34:54.590 --> 34:58.420
Won't unr argue that he leaked
confidential information?

34:58.440 --> 35:02.240
Yes,but daniel's willing
to go on record that

35:02.250 --> 35:06.800
ultima national doctored his
report and committed fraud.

35:07.250 --> 35:11.920
As soon as he does,we can file
a class action against them.

35:11.940 --> 35:16.180
Contrary to ms. Maddox' claims,your
honor,we are not blindly casting a net.

35:16.190 --> 35:19.810
We're requesting these specific files.

35:19.820 --> 35:22.950
This toxicity report
exists and it's damning.

35:22.980 --> 35:26.590
The only reason ms. Hewes is even aware
of these confidential files,your honor,

35:26.600 --> 35:30.890
is because she represented a high-ranking
employee of ours in a criminal matter.

35:30.900 --> 35:34.020
- This,uh,daniel purcell.
- Yes.

35:34.030 --> 35:37.660
Mr. Purcell shared proprietary
information with ms. Hewes.

35:37.670 --> 35:40.290
Now there's a clear ethical conflict.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.960
Mr. Purcell was being
threatened,your honor.

35:42.990 --> 35:48.440
As such,he was forced to share his work in an
effort to protect himself against the company.

35:48.470 --> 35:52.690
Well,in order to establish
mr. Purcell's state of mind,

35:52.700 --> 35:55.860
- i would like to hear directly from him.
- Thank you.

36:07.060 --> 36:09.090
Please state your
name for the court,sir.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.300
Daniel purcell.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.080
Please raise your right hand.

36:12.110 --> 36:15.250
Do you swear to tell the truth,the whole
truth,and nothing but the truth,so help you god?

36:15.260 --> 36:17.110
I do.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.070
Ms.Hewes,your witness.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.060
Thank you,your honor.

36:21.070 --> 36:24.770
Mr. Purcell,could you
please explain to the court

36:24.830 --> 36:29.830
why you thought it necessary to divulge
the proprietary information in question?

36:39.260 --> 36:44.770
Are you aware of any fraudulent activity being
conducted on behalf of ultima national resources?

36:44.780 --> 36:48.450
- Objection. Leading.
- Sustained.

36:48.460 --> 36:50.960
Ms.Hewes,you know better than that.

36:50.980 --> 36:56.810
Did ultima national resources doctor
the results of a scientific study that

36:56.820 --> 36:59.320
you yourself had conducted?

36:59.360 --> 37:02.990
- Objection.
- Overruled. I'll allow it.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.590
You can answer the question.

37:12.890 --> 37:15.850
Unr doctored nothing.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.040
Their results are clean.

37:31.150 --> 37:34.680
The information that I shared
with ms.Hewes in confidence

37:34.690 --> 37:38.640
was in reference to an
entirely unrelated matter.

37:38.650 --> 37:42.880
I subsequently discovered that
my documents were not accurate,

37:42.950 --> 37:48.490
and I never intended for them to be
used against ultima national resources.

37:50.890 --> 37:54.740
Your honor,I move that ms.
Hewes' motion be denied.

37:54.750 --> 37:55.560
Your honor...

37:55.590 --> 37:59.970
I-I'm sorry,ms.Hewes,but there's
no factual basis for your motion.

38:00.010 --> 38:03.910
I would like a short recess to speak
to the witness about his state of mind.

38:03.950 --> 38:06.730
His state of mind seems
perfectly clear to me.

38:06.770 --> 38:11.580
In the future,ms. Hewes,exercise greater
discretion when you bring another such motion.

38:11.590 --> 38:16.330
I caution you not to waste
this court's time again.

38:16.340 --> 38:18.180
Motion denied.

38:18.210 --> 38:20.200
Thank you,your honor.

38:59.590 --> 39:02.380
What are you doing here?

39:04.140 --> 39:06.800
Just a friendly "thank you."

39:08.480 --> 39:11.410
Hey,look. I know this
has been tough on you.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.270
Get off my land.

39:17.870 --> 39:21.720
You want to be alone. I understand.

39:22.730 --> 39:27.610
Mr. Kendrick just wanted you to know
that the first wire transfer went through.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.260
You and erica...

39:32.270 --> 39:34.920
have been provided for.

39:34.930 --> 39:38.440
You've been reasonable. And so will we.

39:38.860 --> 39:41.350
I said leave.

40:00.260 --> 40:02.460
3 WEEKS EARLIER

40:06.790 --> 40:08.720
We're good.

40:11.350 --> 40:13.600
- How you doing?
- Who the hell is this?

40:13.610 --> 40:14.480
My name is kevin.

40:14.490 --> 40:16.910
Shut up. He doesn't
want to know your name.

40:17.310 --> 40:22.210
This ring was on your wife's right hand.

40:22.570 --> 40:28.010
I want you to take it,I want you to wait a
couple of days,pawn it,then keep the ticket.

40:28.020 --> 40:30.050
- Pawn it where?
- Anywhere.

40:30.870 --> 40:33.730
And all you have to do is
take a good look at him.

40:39.460 --> 40:42.410
Everything's going to
be okay,mr. Purcell.

40:42.420 --> 40:46.610
Just go into the house and call 911.
