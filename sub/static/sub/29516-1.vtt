00:48.646 --> 00:50.748
[police siren blaring]

00:50.815 --> 00:54.986
[man on radio] <i>MPD Tech-Ops to
Metropolis City Hall. 2078W in progress.</i>

00:55.052 --> 00:57.955
Kidnapping with advanced weapons.
Got to be Intergang.

00:58.022 --> 01:00.791
They took out half the reserve
with their tech weapons last week.

01:00.858 --> 01:02.960
Makes you nostalgic
for assault rifles.

01:03.027 --> 01:05.896
- [chopper whirring]
- [chattering on radio]

01:05.963 --> 01:09.066
- [police siren blaring]
- [guns cocking]

01:19.676 --> 01:21.811
[policeman whimpering]

01:25.249 --> 01:26.683
[screaming]

01:29.819 --> 01:30.987
[police siren blaring]

01:31.054 --> 01:33.189
It's a laugh
to chose the plaza, Maggie.

01:33.256 --> 01:37.327
These assholes are expecting something
to wreck, Dan. Probably with a cape.

01:37.394 --> 01:39.828
Lucky me,
I know a back way.

01:43.466 --> 01:45.735
[metal suit clanking]

01:55.278 --> 01:57.746
[grunts]

01:57.813 --> 01:59.715
Get Mr. Mayor and his
better half out of here

01:59.782 --> 02:01.784
before we get in trouble
from the man upstairs.

02:01.850 --> 02:04.086
Didn't know you
was a believer, boss.

02:04.153 --> 02:07.022
That ain't the man upstairs
I'm talking about.

02:08.223 --> 02:09.425
[chuckles]

02:09.491 --> 02:10.959
[tires screeching]

02:11.026 --> 02:12.627
[grunting]

02:13.828 --> 02:16.366
Step away from
the Mayor, Mannheim.

02:16.433 --> 02:17.699
Don't give me a reason.

02:17.766 --> 02:19.902
Then you shouldn't
have given me one.

02:20.769 --> 02:23.806
[Dan and Maggie groan]

02:23.872 --> 02:27.575
You, make sure they're dead.
Painfully sure.

02:27.642 --> 02:32.780
And you, grab our esteemed
Mayor while I call for a ride.

02:32.847 --> 02:35.116
[Dan] Okay. I'll get you
out of here.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.285
[groans]

02:39.487 --> 02:41.222
[choking]

02:42.523 --> 02:44.758
[sighs and gasps]

02:46.495 --> 02:48.696
[laughing]

02:48.763 --> 02:52.633
Come on, fella. You don't
want to be a cop killer.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.068
Yeah, why's that?

02:54.135 --> 02:55.903
[gunshots]

02:58.139 --> 03:00.241
- [yells]
- [heat vision beaming]

03:01.209 --> 03:03.544
Huh?

03:03.610 --> 03:07.914
[Superman] Hey, ever wonder what it
feels like to fall from a great distance?

03:09.950 --> 03:12.152
- [Superman] Let's find out.
- [groans]

03:12.219 --> 03:16.290
- [yells in pain]
- [Superman] Oh, looks like it hurts.

03:18.226 --> 03:19.659
Be right back.

03:22.829 --> 03:25.198
[screaming]

03:28.101 --> 03:30.871
[Mannheim] Work, damn it!
Stupid piece of crap!

03:30.937 --> 03:33.340
You're supposed to
transport me on my command.

03:33.406 --> 03:36.209
[Superman] Don't bother.
Fried it with my heat vision.

03:36.276 --> 03:37.310
[gasps]

03:39.212 --> 03:41.515
Only place you're being
transported to, Mannheim,

03:41.581 --> 03:45.318
it's got three squares a day,
and lights out at 8:00.

03:45.385 --> 03:47.087
Son of a...

03:47.154 --> 03:49.489
[grunts]

03:49.556 --> 03:54.194
[Superman] You know, if there's one
thing I can't stand, it's a bully.

03:55.495 --> 03:57.763
[grunts]

04:00.600 --> 04:02.668
[groaning]

04:11.676 --> 04:12.877
[exclaims]

04:13.745 --> 04:15.014
[grunts]

04:22.354 --> 04:23.888
[grunting]

04:49.047 --> 04:50.181
[grunts]

04:53.218 --> 04:56.454
[Superman] Guys like you
give Metropolis a bad name.

04:56.521 --> 04:58.755
[growling]

04:58.822 --> 05:02.826
- [yelling and grunting]
- [crackling]

05:06.730 --> 05:08.899
But you should know
by now, Mannheim,

05:08.966 --> 05:12.069
no one tears my city apart
and gets away with it.

05:31.954 --> 05:33.789
[police sirens blaring]

05:33.856 --> 05:38.327
I feel like I say this a couple of
times a week but thanks, Superman.

05:38.394 --> 05:40.229
I don't know what
we'd do without you.

05:40.296 --> 05:43.065
You sound like a guy who
wants my vote, Mr. Mayor.

05:43.132 --> 05:45.068
[Bibbo] Hey, hey.
That's my friend there.

05:45.135 --> 05:50.674
[chuckles] Superman!
Hey, it's me, your old buddy.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.909
Bibbo Bibbowski. How is
the unluckiest sailor in town?

05:53.976 --> 05:57.681
Ah, come on. You ain't have to
save my bacon that many times!

05:57.748 --> 06:01.517
Anyway, ain't no sailor no more.
I'm a restaurateur.

06:01.584 --> 06:03.785
Ace O' Clubs Bar and Grill.

06:03.852 --> 06:05.820
How about a picture
for the joint?

06:07.989 --> 06:10.292
- [camera flickering]
- Yeah.

06:10.358 --> 06:13.028
Stupid thing. Never works
when you need it to.

06:13.094 --> 06:14.396
I got you covered.

06:14.462 --> 06:16.866
[Bibbo] Jimmy Olsen,
you're a lifesaver.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.635
[Jimmy]
Say Superman!

06:19.702 --> 06:22.103
- Superman!
- [camera clicks]

06:22.171 --> 06:25.173
[chuckles]
Thanks, big guy.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.242
I'll make sure to get
this to you, Mr. Bibbowski.

06:27.309 --> 06:30.912
See you down at the joint, kid.
The ribs are on me.

06:32.147 --> 06:34.882
Thanks, Jimmy. I really have
to get going.

06:34.949 --> 06:37.485
Leaguers, is anyone...

06:37.552 --> 06:40.388
- Available?
- 'Sup?

06:40.455 --> 06:43.891
I have to be somewhere.
Think you could help with the cleanup?

06:43.957 --> 06:45.628
Oh, again?

06:45.695 --> 06:49.364
I swear you guys think I'm some
sort of one-man janitorial crew.

06:49.431 --> 06:52.133
Well, while you're at it,
my apartment could use a going over.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.704
Whoa! What the hell
have you been up against?

06:55.770 --> 06:59.574
An Intergang crew that somehow
got a hold of a Mother Box.

06:59.641 --> 07:02.543
[beeping]

07:02.610 --> 07:06.847
[Cyborg] And that's not all.
This armor's from Apokolips, too.

07:07.448 --> 07:08.881
How you figure?

07:09.982 --> 07:12.252
I'm wearing the same stuff,
remember?

07:12.319 --> 07:15.390
Oh, great. Leftovers
from our war with Darkseid.

07:15.457 --> 07:18.392
We need to get this analyzed.
Maybe one of the others could help.

07:18.459 --> 07:21.028
No, we need someone
who's worked with this crap.

07:21.095 --> 07:23.464
Someone who knows it
inside and out.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.566
We need my dad.

07:25.632 --> 07:29.570
I could take it to him if you want.
I know you two don't exactly...

07:29.636 --> 07:34.407
Nah, it's cool. No problem
ever got better by avoiding it.

07:34.474 --> 07:36.542
Well, at least,
I won't be slowing you down on cleanup.

07:36.609 --> 07:39.379
- Later, partner.
- I owe you one, Flash.

07:40.246 --> 07:42.448
You owe me
about 30.

07:42.515 --> 07:45.285
I wonder if it's too late
to join the Titans.

07:46.253 --> 07:47.920
Is there an age limit?

07:48.689 --> 07:50.189
[cars honking]

07:53.559 --> 07:56.596
[Lois sighs] He's gonna take
pictures with anyone who asks.

07:58.264 --> 08:00.333
The guy just can't
help himself.

08:05.270 --> 08:07.239
You said
two minutes, tops.

08:07.305 --> 08:09.341
Sorry, Miss Lane,
tech-enhanced gangsters

08:09.408 --> 08:12.244
kidnapping the Mayor and
other assorted distractions.

08:12.310 --> 08:13.945
I know. I saw it live.

08:14.012 --> 08:16.149
Are you sure you're not
just getting old?

08:16.215 --> 08:17.916
You'll have to tell me
what that's like.

08:17.983 --> 08:20.386
Ha! Super touche.

08:20.453 --> 08:23.890
[Superman] Your stories about Superman
helped me earn the people's trust.

08:23.955 --> 08:26.591
Now it's time they learned
about the Kryptonian tech

08:26.658 --> 08:29.594
that brought the strange visitor
from another planet to Earth.

08:31.530 --> 08:34.666
And here's the compartment
that contained me as an infant.

08:34.732 --> 08:36.501
Throughout the trip, it was
in charge of monitoring

08:36.568 --> 08:39.871
my genetic makeup as well
as my basic metabolism.

08:39.970 --> 08:41.938
Not to mention
midnight feedings.

08:43.006 --> 08:44.609
How did it do all this?

08:44.676 --> 08:47.746
I've only gotten so far
studying Kryptonian technology.

08:47.813 --> 08:50.682
That's why I handed the job over
to Dr. Klyburn and her crew.

08:50.749 --> 08:52.918
Which we were more
than happy to take on.

08:52.983 --> 08:56.788
Only recently have we discovered these
super condensed ionized crystals.

08:56.855 --> 09:00.991
We believe they acted as hyperwave
acceleration units for transport.

09:01.058 --> 09:02.760
Oh, the gas.

09:02.827 --> 09:06.597
To put it simply. We pulled it
from the main section of the pod,

09:06.664 --> 09:09.400
the baby's car seat,
so to speak.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.769
It can only be
activated one way.

09:11.836 --> 09:14.337
You might want to look away for a
moment, Miss Lane.

09:15.639 --> 09:19.310
Kryptonian tech
can be a bit overwhelming.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.980
[Lois] Holy...

09:25.783 --> 09:30.754
Your identity genome
is confirmed, Kal-El.

09:30.821 --> 09:35.725
I am the data matrix, the physical
embodiment of a personally attuned program

09:35.792 --> 09:40.363
designed as a repository for all
that is Kryptonian in nature.

09:40.430 --> 09:43.098
My sole purpose on this
journey is to inform you,

09:43.165 --> 09:47.270
assist you and protect you
and all Kryptonian life.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.172
- During...
- Wait a second. Is he...

09:49.239 --> 09:50.707
[Superman]
Yes, Miss Lane.

09:50.773 --> 09:53.943
You're looking at the last
son of Krypton's nanny.

09:54.009 --> 09:55.211
Keep watching.

09:55.278 --> 09:56.880
As I have
also been entrusted

09:56.946 --> 10:00.984
with preserving the history
of all Kryptonian bloodlines.

10:01.049 --> 10:03.385
We will begin with yours.

10:03.452 --> 10:06.990
- The House of El.
- [Lois] Wait, is that...

10:07.055 --> 10:08.790
There's your headline,
Miss Lane.

10:08.857 --> 10:12.661
I'll like you and the rest of
the world to meet my parents.

10:30.979 --> 10:32.948
So, what do you think?

10:33.015 --> 10:34.883
I don't know what
to say. It's...

10:34.950 --> 10:39.353
Hey, Superman,
looking good.

10:39.420 --> 10:43.791
It's gonna be a reminder
of just how alien you are.

10:43.858 --> 10:47.094
People forget that when you're
saving them from falling airplanes.

10:47.161 --> 10:49.731
- [tires screech, horn honks]
- True, but I have faith that...

10:49.798 --> 10:51.600
- [honking]
- [man] Hey, you rock, Superman!

10:52.701 --> 10:54.669
Thanks. You do... too.

10:58.105 --> 10:59.507
There's a really
smart woman I know

10:59.574 --> 11:02.610
who always says daylight
is the best disinfectant.

11:03.444 --> 11:05.913
Lift back to the <i>Planet?</i>

11:05.980 --> 11:10.718
And save me from expensing cab fare
to Perry White? You are heroic.

11:12.752 --> 11:15.656
You know me,
always saving the day.

11:46.453 --> 11:48.521
[people chattering excitedly]

11:52.224 --> 11:54.728
Thanks for the ride.
I gotta go.

11:54.794 --> 11:57.396
- [woman] There he is!
- [man 1] Hey Superman, can I get a selfie?

11:57.463 --> 12:00.699
- [man 2] Me too.
- [all clamoring]

12:00.767 --> 12:04.269
- [elevator dings]
- [chuckles]

12:04.336 --> 12:06.405
- You're in a rush.
- Got a big story.

12:06.472 --> 12:08.240
I don't want
to spoil your day

12:08.307 --> 12:11.043
but you're looking at the guy
with an exclusive on Intergang.

12:11.110 --> 12:13.712
Well, that's nice.
Come with me.

12:15.447 --> 12:18.183
[chuckles] What's
bigger than Intergang?

12:18.250 --> 12:20.053
You'll find out.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.089
No, right. You had that
interview with your super friend.

12:24.155 --> 12:25.624
I know what that means.

12:28.359 --> 12:30.161
[sighs]
In here.

12:38.137 --> 12:39.671
[moans]

12:40.805 --> 12:43.441
You're always on fire
after seeing him.

12:43.508 --> 12:45.410
Should I be jealous?

12:45.477 --> 12:47.445
I think it's the tights.

12:47.512 --> 12:50.248
I can pick up a pair
if that's all it takes.

12:50.314 --> 12:54.752
Perfect. Wear 'em on our trip
to the Hamptons this weekend.

12:54.819 --> 12:56.821
Uh, about that...

12:57.922 --> 13:01.559
[scoffs] Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

13:01.626 --> 13:04.095
Do you know how hard
it is for me to get away?

13:04.162 --> 13:06.563
I gave up that interview
with the Secretary of State!

13:06.630 --> 13:08.732
- I can explain.
- Really?

13:08.799 --> 13:10.734
You mean it's not
some secret meeting

13:10.801 --> 13:13.370
with some secret spies
in some secret location?

13:13.437 --> 13:14.939
My parents are in town.

13:16.306 --> 13:20.712
Serious? So,
you buried the lede?

13:20.778 --> 13:24.182
This weekend just got
a whole lot more interesting.

13:24.247 --> 13:27.718
Um... I don't...

13:27.784 --> 13:28.952
You don't what?

13:29.019 --> 13:30.587
Want me to meet them?

13:30.654 --> 13:32.321
Don't you think it's time?

13:35.692 --> 13:38.394
Lois, wait.
It's just that...

13:38.461 --> 13:40.496
Look, Clark, I'm not
gonna waste time

13:40.563 --> 13:43.733
worrying if a guy likes me or not.
We're both adults.

13:43.799 --> 13:49.305
I know it was my idea to keep things
secret at work, but I'm really trying here.

13:49.372 --> 13:53.677
No. No, you're right.
You should meet them.

13:53.744 --> 13:55.979
It's just that this is
uncharted territory for me

13:56.046 --> 13:59.281
and there's some things
I need to get used to sharing.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.384
Clark, it's your parents.

14:03.085 --> 14:05.054
What am I gonna find out?

14:05.121 --> 14:06.689
That you were a huge dork?

14:08.124 --> 14:09.524
I already know that.

14:20.469 --> 14:23.506
It'll be fine. Just fine.

14:30.146 --> 14:32.881
[Superman] Well, Dr. Stone,
what's the verdict?

14:35.583 --> 14:40.555
It matches what we've seen from other
Apokoliptian tech, but not completely.

14:40.622 --> 14:42.757
John, can you come
here for a moment?

14:42.824 --> 14:45.060
I can't remember the last
time you asked for help.

14:46.628 --> 14:49.931
Dr. Irons is one of S.T.A.R.
Labs premier engineers.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.737
If it's about this metal,
Silas, I've been... Oh.

14:57.304 --> 14:59.606
That's him.

14:59.674 --> 15:02.243
- Have we met?
- At a construction site, once.

15:02.309 --> 15:06.380
I had just quit LexCorp and
wanted to get my mind off it.

15:06.446 --> 15:09.284
I remember. Nice shirt.

15:09.349 --> 15:11.418
I wear it with pride.

15:11.485 --> 15:13.987
Oh, can we just
do this already?

15:14.054 --> 15:15.322
What'd you find, John?

15:15.389 --> 15:19.093
It's definitely
from Apokolips.

15:19.160 --> 15:24.832
But it's been bonded with Earth-based
tri-formulite at an atomic level.

15:24.898 --> 15:26.967
The combination
makes this stronger.

15:28.367 --> 15:30.070
Incredible!

15:30.137 --> 15:32.873
That means it's even
stronger than you, Victor.

15:32.940 --> 15:35.741
Always got an encouraging
word, huh, Dad?

15:35.808 --> 15:39.879
You'd need some very sophisticated
resources to produce an alloy like this.

15:39.946 --> 15:43.482
The S.T.A.R. Labs could do it,
but it sure didn't come from here.

15:43.549 --> 15:45.819
Maybe Wayne Tech. Or even...

15:45.886 --> 15:49.957
Of course. Cyborg,
we'll catch up later.

15:52.558 --> 15:55.428
Thank you both for
your time and expertise.

15:55.494 --> 15:57.463
You're welcome, Superman.

16:02.602 --> 16:06.205
I appreciate you bringing
me in on this, son.

16:06.272 --> 16:08.607
It's been a long time.

16:08.673 --> 16:11.643
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.

16:14.314 --> 16:16.082
[Cyborg]
Dr. Irons, you good?

16:17.183 --> 16:18.851
Better than ever, Victor.

16:34.132 --> 16:35.634
Lose something, Lex?

16:36.234 --> 16:38.336
[Lex sighs]

16:38.402 --> 16:43.440
I'm sorry. What are we
blaming me for now, Superman?

16:43.507 --> 16:45.744
Those weapons
this morning.

16:45.810 --> 16:47.246
They're based
on alien technology,

16:47.313 --> 16:50.315
but clearly modified
for Intergang here on Earth.

16:50.382 --> 16:52.449
Ooh, that sounds scary.

16:52.516 --> 16:57.554
But as you can see, I spend my days under
house arrest, wearing this crude leash.

16:57.621 --> 17:00.491
I've added a little dash
of Kryptonite green.

17:02.327 --> 17:04.127
Don't worry, it's not real.

17:06.297 --> 17:08.098
Oh, come on.

17:08.165 --> 17:11.702
Intergang has connections all over
the planet. It could be anyone.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.373
We'll get to
the bottom of it, Lex.

17:15.439 --> 17:18.909
And when we do, I'll be back.

17:18.976 --> 17:21.712
You know something
I don't know?

17:21.779 --> 17:26.650
Only that this city's never going
to love you just for hating me.

17:32.555 --> 17:34.490
[growls]

17:36.926 --> 17:40.530
But Senator, the rents on
those slums were raised 200%.

17:40.596 --> 17:43.565
As the newly disclosed owner,
you must have some kind of a comment.

17:43.632 --> 17:44.969
[dial tone]

17:46.070 --> 17:49.639
- I guess not.
- [Cat] Incoming.

17:51.074 --> 17:54.110
I heard something juicy
and I had to share.

17:54.177 --> 17:57.080
Doesn't <i>Daily Planet Live</i>
go on the air in two minutes?

17:57.146 --> 17:59.916
Mmm-mmm. I'm not on
until the second segment.

18:01.451 --> 18:03.052
I'm sure it could wait.

18:03.819 --> 18:05.554
[keyboard clacking]

18:05.620 --> 18:08.590
So you're meeting
the parents?

18:08.657 --> 18:10.959
Oh, God, make it stop.

18:11.026 --> 18:13.295
Lois, you're great.
I respect you.

18:13.362 --> 18:15.798
I wanted to be you until
I found out on camera

18:15.865 --> 18:17.734
there's more than digging
through government garbage.

18:17.800 --> 18:22.637
- Who told you anyway?
- You did, just now.

18:22.704 --> 18:27.509
I had a suspicion something was up when
you stopped calling him "Smallville."

18:28.810 --> 18:30.712
- I did?
- [scoffs]

18:30.779 --> 18:33.248
Sweetie, the women here notice
everything about tall, handsome men.

18:33.315 --> 18:35.917
And the only competition in
this place is Steve Lombard,

18:35.984 --> 18:38.853
and he makes me feel
like I need a shower.

18:38.919 --> 18:42.089
Hello ladies, did someone
mention the Stevenator?

18:42.156 --> 18:45.394
Yes, I think it was
human resources.

18:45.461 --> 18:46.962
You see my point.

18:49.097 --> 18:50.598
Hey!

18:50.664 --> 18:53.301
Listen, Cat, Clark and I are
just good friends right now.

18:53.368 --> 18:56.071
You wanna spread it around
the office? Have at it.

18:56.138 --> 18:58.639
- Just let me get back to work, okay?
- Okay, okay.

18:59.408 --> 19:01.376
Just be careful.

19:01.443 --> 19:03.811
You always said Clark seemed different,
like he's got a wall around him.

19:03.878 --> 19:08.049
It's like he doesn't want anyone to
get too close, you know what I mean?

19:09.250 --> 19:11.519
Yeah, I guess I do.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.120
[man] We need you
on set, Miss Grant.

19:13.187 --> 19:15.223
- [beeps]
- That's my cue. See ya.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.855
[Terri] Dropped something?

19:48.922 --> 19:51.024
As your long-suffering,
devoted wife,

19:51.091 --> 19:53.059
I'm used to your butter
fingers at home

19:53.126 --> 19:56.496
but, Hank, you're setting
a bad example for the others.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.098
Yeah, Commander,
I'm starting to wonder

19:58.164 --> 20:00.333
if we got the wrong
Henshaw in charge.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.469
Guys, I'm happy to let
Terri call the shots,

20:02.535 --> 20:05.170
but I got to warn you,
I'm considered the nice Henshaw.

20:05.237 --> 20:06.839
Yeah, right.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.907
Terri, give Houston a call.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.310
Looks like they were right
about the hydraulic struts.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.980
The launch vibration probably
knocked some screws loose.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.182
Knocked some screws
loose. Very technical.

20:16.249 --> 20:20.953
Well, I'm sure you can science
that up a bit, Madam Engineer.

20:21.019 --> 20:24.990
Houston, this is <i>Excalibur.</i>
Come in, Houston.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.159
[Hank] Come on,
Space Rangers.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.627
Last looks before
we head back in.

20:29.694 --> 20:34.166
It's your ninth trip up here, boss.
You can't still be dazzled.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.268
I'm just looking
for a red cape.

20:36.335 --> 20:39.137
You can see it
if he's above the exosphere.

20:39.203 --> 20:42.273
He's been up here twice, you know.
Saved my ass, one time.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.880
[Hank] Yes, sir.
You can always count on Superman.

21:14.506 --> 21:16.874
[stammers] I hated to
interrupt your plans.

21:16.941 --> 21:19.277
How was your night
in the town, Mr. Luthor?

21:23.414 --> 21:25.048
Phenomenal, Gregory.

21:25.115 --> 21:27.817
But then again,
every private performance by the Bolshoi

21:27.884 --> 21:30.053
is a little better
when it's forbidden.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.222
Do you have something for me?

21:32.289 --> 21:35.058
Uh... [clears throat]
Right.

21:35.125 --> 21:38.827
Sometimes I forget which one of us the
government's placed under house arrest.

21:40.729 --> 21:42.131
I don't.

21:47.003 --> 21:50.740
Hank? They need you
back online. Important.

21:52.008 --> 21:53.809
Henshaw here. What's up?

21:55.445 --> 21:57.012
Oh, hell!

21:57.080 --> 21:59.014
We've got unidentified
debris heading our way.

21:59.081 --> 22:01.250
Everyone, back
to the ship. Now!

22:03.219 --> 22:04.386
Leave it!

22:13.896 --> 22:17.766
[Lex] Always happy to walk among the
greatest minds of this generation.

22:18.734 --> 22:21.170
That's why I bought them.

22:21.237 --> 22:24.440
That specimen's clearly
porphyritic rock.

22:24.506 --> 22:26.475
Read a book, you clod.

22:28.410 --> 22:32.146
At last, someone understands
Euclid's fifth postulate.

22:32.914 --> 22:34.849
Too bad it's not you.

22:38.253 --> 22:40.822
I do not suffer fools, people.

22:42.023 --> 22:44.293
The world is filled
with too many already,

22:44.360 --> 22:47.795
obsequious cretins
who worship aliens,

22:47.862 --> 22:50.798
believing them to be
the agents of justice.

22:50.865 --> 22:55.570
But I have seen the alien's true face.
I understand his threat.

22:55.637 --> 22:58.805
In spite of my false conviction
at the hands of these vigilantes,

22:58.873 --> 23:02.776
LexCorp has stayed on mission,
redoubling its efforts

23:02.843 --> 23:05.012
to find the next
alien <i>Ubermensch</i>

23:05.078 --> 23:07.749
and crush it
in its infancy.

23:09.249 --> 23:12.552
- Now, show me what you've found.
- Okay.

23:15.423 --> 23:17.592
They hacked into Houston's
encrypted feed

23:17.659 --> 23:20.794
from the <i>Excalibur</i> shuttle,
and something's heading our way.

23:20.861 --> 23:22.563
[beeping]

23:25.932 --> 23:29.970
[Hank] <i>We've got 30 seconds.
You need to fire engines now!</i>

23:30.037 --> 23:34.308
I'd like to see what they're running
away from. Do we have a satellite nearby?

23:34.374 --> 23:35.975
[tapping keys]

23:39.812 --> 23:41.147
Enlarge.

23:45.218 --> 23:48.221
Does that asteroid look
unusual to you?

23:48.288 --> 23:51.458
- It looks lumpy.
- Hmm.

23:52.858 --> 23:54.894
I was going
to say pregnant.

23:57.830 --> 24:00.266
[devices beeping]

24:01.567 --> 24:04.170
Tether's still attached,
Bay door's open. 12 degrees.

24:04.236 --> 24:07.173
I don't care. Initiate
primary thrusters now!

24:10.743 --> 24:14.013
- [rumbling]
- Captain, impact! We're breaking up!

24:14.080 --> 24:16.082
We lost starboard
thrusters and...

24:16.148 --> 24:17.850
Oh, my God, Hank,
we're not gonna make it.

24:17.917 --> 24:19.786
- [man] What do you say, Captain?
- Like hell, we're not!

24:19.852 --> 24:22.588
Superman will save us,
just like always.

24:27.992 --> 24:30.061
- [all yelling]
- [man] We're breaking up!

24:32.565 --> 24:36.601
Stay calm, everyone.
He's on his way. I know it.

24:36.668 --> 24:38.503
- Lose some thrusters. Out of control...
- Hey, what are you...

24:38.570 --> 24:41.573
It's okay, Terri. You can
always count on Superman.

24:44.410 --> 24:46.412
[all yelling]

24:46.479 --> 24:49.080
- [Terri screaming]
- Terri, no!

24:51.649 --> 24:53.351
[gasping]

24:53.418 --> 24:56.221
Superman, I knew
you'd come.

25:30.521 --> 25:32.021
[beeps]

25:32.088 --> 25:34.625
[man] <i>Mr. Luthor?
I have to hurry before I'm missed.</i>

25:34.691 --> 25:36.993
<i>The meteorite's impact was
in the mid-Atlantic channel,</i>

25:37.059 --> 25:41.597
<i>coordinates 4712 North,
74595 West.</i>

25:41.664 --> 25:43.366
<i>Did you get that?</i>

25:43.433 --> 25:46.036
[Lex] You son's anti-toxin will
be delivered within the hour.

25:46.103 --> 25:49.105
- Congratulations on his survival.
- [phone beeps]

25:50.607 --> 25:52.408
Time to go for a swim.

25:56.379 --> 25:59.449
- [grunts]
- [snarling]

26:01.818 --> 26:03.386
[Wonder Woman]
Clark, flank me!

26:03.453 --> 26:05.221
[grunts]

26:11.493 --> 26:14.964
Seriously, Diana.
We need to use code names in the field.

26:15.031 --> 26:17.166
You just called me Diana.

26:17.233 --> 26:18.701
But that's what you
want to be called.

26:18.768 --> 26:19.968
[snarling]

26:21.571 --> 26:23.906
- You want to be called Superman?
- [grunts]

26:23.972 --> 26:26.374
[groans]

26:26.441 --> 26:28.945
Sounds like even your ego
is super strong.

26:29.010 --> 26:31.379
I just don't need
my real name public.

26:31.446 --> 26:32.447
Besides...

26:35.016 --> 26:36.184
I like Superman.

26:36.251 --> 26:39.053
- [snarling]
- [grunts]

26:41.423 --> 26:44.226
Because Wonder Man sounds
like we're married?

26:44.292 --> 26:47.562
No. Because
she gave it to me.

26:49.531 --> 26:50.999
[grunts]

26:56.538 --> 26:57.839
You mean Lois?

26:57.906 --> 26:59.541
Yeah, Lois.

27:02.744 --> 27:07.681
Funny how you use her actual name,
but don't allow her to know yours.

27:10.284 --> 27:12.085
It's a complicated
relationship.

27:13.086 --> 27:14.756
Kind of like ours was.

27:16.190 --> 27:17.726
It was nice for a while.

27:18.793 --> 27:20.227
Yes, it was.

27:21.529 --> 27:23.397
It's just as well.
[sighs]

27:23.464 --> 27:26.534
I wasn't very good at playing
this masquerade of yours.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.101
Towel?

27:28.167 --> 27:29.570
I don't sweat.

27:30.270 --> 27:32.338
Maybe not on the outside.

27:35.241 --> 27:37.210
[Cyborg] <i>Guys, Lennon
finally made it.</i>

27:37.277 --> 27:38.611
<i>We're all in
the meeting room.</i>

27:43.717 --> 27:46.554
[Hazelwood] <i>Descending
down, past 9,000 meters.</i>

27:49.322 --> 27:55.628
<i>2,500 meters. I hear something
off the port side.</i> [gasps]

27:55.695 --> 27:58.431
[Lex] I'm paying you for
your experience, Hazelwood.

27:58.498 --> 28:00.333
Be skittish on
your own time.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.503
[Hazelwood] <i>We're already at
10,000 meters, Mr. Luthor.</i>

28:03.570 --> 28:07.239
Dive deeper. I wanna
find that meteorite.

28:24.289 --> 28:27.593
Uh, Mr. Luthor,
there's someone out there.

28:34.733 --> 28:39.236
[Lex] Those are Atlanteans,
you idiot. Aquaman's tribe.

28:39.303 --> 28:41.807
[Mercy] Hold on, Lex.
I'm picking up something.

28:44.978 --> 28:50.248
[muffled breathing]

28:59.858 --> 29:03.194
I suppose you want us to find
out where that's coming from.

29:03.260 --> 29:05.396
[Lex]
<i>You suppose correctly.</i>

29:12.535 --> 29:17.875
[muffled breathing continues]

29:20.044 --> 29:21.445
[Hazelwood]
<i>They stopped.</i>

29:28.953 --> 29:30.387
[Atlanteans scream]

29:34.091 --> 29:36.726
[Hazelwood] <i>Something just grabbed them!
I can't get a visual.</i>

29:36.793 --> 29:41.196
- [Atlanteans screaming]
- [Hazelwood] <i>It sounds like they're being torn apart!</i>

29:41.263 --> 29:43.433
<i>Mr. Luthor,
are you still there?</i>

29:45.535 --> 29:49.140
We've better get out of here!
We gotta... We gotta...

29:50.273 --> 29:51.808
[screams]

29:53.343 --> 29:55.245
What the hell?

29:55.311 --> 29:58.748
- [screams]
- [alarm beeping]

30:01.350 --> 30:03.285
[Hazelwood screaming]

30:03.352 --> 30:06.255
- [Hazelwood whimpering]
- [heavy thudding]

30:32.413 --> 30:33.749
He's gone.

30:34.850 --> 30:37.820
Go back. I want
to see that thing again.

30:38.219 --> 30:39.887
[static]

30:41.556 --> 30:44.693
[Lex] Amazing. A creature
who's traveled light years

30:44.760 --> 30:48.362
through space and survived
a catastrophic entry to Earth.

30:48.429 --> 30:51.532
The Blue Boy Scout could
have some competition.

30:56.938 --> 31:01.642
Okay, next up, the operating budget
for the upcoming fiscal year.

31:01.709 --> 31:05.445
Utilities are above what the
UN cleared for funding, guys.

31:05.513 --> 31:07.849
I'll handle it.
Move on, Cyborg.

31:07.915 --> 31:10.885
Wonder Woman merchandise
did very well this year.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.921
I can step up when the Wayne
Foundation falls short.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.891
You're kidding, right?

31:16.958 --> 31:20.628
Okay, okay. Let's just agree we
have this covered. What else?

31:20.695 --> 31:22.697
Just the <i>Excalibur</i> incident.

31:22.764 --> 31:24.397
Only three bodies recovered.

31:24.464 --> 31:26.968
I've got my guards
investigating the impact area.

31:27.034 --> 31:28.902
S.T.A.R. Labs wanted
some rock samples.

31:28.970 --> 31:32.072
All right. Well, if that's
it, we'll meet next Thursday.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.407
Same Bat time,
same Bat channel.

31:34.474 --> 31:36.676
- I won't be here.
- Why?

31:36.743 --> 31:38.845
Yeah, if I can be here,
you can be here.

31:38.912 --> 31:41.413
Dude, it takes you all of three
seconds to get here and back.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.085
Two at most,
but point taken.

31:44.152 --> 31:48.021
I have a meeting with the headmaster
at Damian's boarding school.

31:48.089 --> 31:52.926
[chuckles] No way! Batman has a
parent-teacher conference? That's great.

31:52.993 --> 31:57.898
Are you in the PTA too?
Tell me you're in the PTA.

31:57.964 --> 31:59.833
[clears throat,
imitates Batman] I'm Batman.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.867
We need more chaperones
for homecoming.

32:01.935 --> 32:04.303
Who has to be
convinced to sign up?

32:04.370 --> 32:07.373
[chuckles nervously]

32:09.975 --> 32:13.612
[clears throat] I'm just joking.
I think that's great.

32:15.248 --> 32:16.816
Is he still
glaring at me?

32:17.951 --> 32:19.385
[Batman] Hmm.

32:19.451 --> 32:21.620
We could just push the
meeting back to that evening.

32:21.687 --> 32:25.323
Ah, can't. I've got
rehearsal dinner that night.

32:26.258 --> 32:28.260
Is he in a play?

32:28.326 --> 32:31.529
He's getting married. Somehow.

32:31.596 --> 32:33.032
Yup, married the next day.

32:33.098 --> 32:37.502
Limos, banquet hall, DJ,
the whole shebang.

32:37.569 --> 32:39.504
Just immediate family,
you understand?

32:40.138 --> 32:41.773
Does Iris know?

32:41.840 --> 32:43.341
She better,
she picked the date.

32:43.408 --> 32:47.746
No, I mean, does
she know about you?

32:47.813 --> 32:49.547
Are you kidding?
I told her ages ago.

32:49.614 --> 32:52.951
Oh, geez, Supes. You can't drop
a bomb like that on a honeymoon.

32:54.619 --> 32:56.921
- Aren't you worried?
- About what?

32:56.988 --> 32:59.057
About bringing her
into your world?

32:59.123 --> 33:01.491
The dangers, the sacrifice...

33:02.894 --> 33:05.562
Clark, that's what
marriage is all about.

33:10.667 --> 33:14.205
This calls for a toast.
We've got some beer in the fridge.

33:14.272 --> 33:16.774
I know. Milk for you.

33:16.841 --> 33:21.112
Congratulations. Where you going?
Fiji, Bora Bora, SeaWorld?

33:21.179 --> 33:24.414
[Green Lantern] Okay, Flash,
there are times when speed is not good.

33:31.188 --> 33:34.557
[Jonathan] So next thing I know,
he's climbed on top of that bull.

33:34.625 --> 33:36.793
It couldn't throw off
my little Clark though.

33:36.860 --> 33:38.794
The kid was
a daredevil.

33:38.862 --> 33:41.631
This Clark? The guy
who irons his socks?

33:41.697 --> 33:43.734
Dad, come on! TMI.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.670
- What's that mean?
- Too much information, Jonathan.

33:46.737 --> 33:49.840
I'm sure Lois has heard
half these stories before.

33:49.907 --> 33:51.141
Not really.

33:52.009 --> 33:54.577
Not at all.

33:54.644 --> 33:57.480
That's because if my folks
have taught me one thing,

33:57.546 --> 33:59.415
it's not to talk
about myself.

33:59.482 --> 34:01.584
[chuckles]
That's a parent's job.

34:01.651 --> 34:05.588
Mission accomplished.
Sounds like there's a lot I don't know.

34:06.689 --> 34:08.958
Warn me now, if I should
keep my distance.

34:09.025 --> 34:12.962
Well, you wouldn't be the first
young lady to break his heart.

34:13.030 --> 34:14.897
TMI, Ma!

34:14.964 --> 34:17.367
Oh, now, we're getting
to the good stuff.

34:17.433 --> 34:22.271
[laughs] Well, first there was
Lana, lovely girl, lived next door.

34:22.338 --> 34:25.607
She'd come over every once in a
while, not... not like Pete Ross.

34:25.674 --> 34:27.877
I mean, he was
there every day.

34:27.944 --> 34:30.246
I always wondered
about that boy.

34:30.313 --> 34:35.216
Well, then there was the girl on the
swim team. Laurel, Laura... um...

34:35.284 --> 34:37.351
Lori. Lori Lemaris.

34:37.420 --> 34:41.755
I remember her.
She was quite a catch. [laughs]

34:41.822 --> 34:44.126
- Pa!
- Clark's right.

34:44.193 --> 34:47.996
Maybe we shouldn't talk about her.
I am serving halibut.

34:48.063 --> 34:49.231
[groans]

34:53.735 --> 34:56.972
Come on. Taxi!

34:57.038 --> 35:00.075
Here it comes.
And there it goes.

35:01.608 --> 35:03.111
You okay?

35:03.178 --> 35:05.380
You couldn't wait to get me
out of there, could you?

35:05.447 --> 35:08.816
Well, that's not true. I didn't want
you to be bored by all those stories.

35:08.882 --> 35:10.884
Bored? Clark,
this is the first time

35:10.951 --> 35:13.355
I think I've ever learned
anything about you.

35:13.421 --> 35:16.590
To be honest, it drove home how
much distance you keep between us.

35:16.657 --> 35:19.493
Lois, you know me
better than anyone.

35:20.462 --> 35:22.464
Then that's a real shame.

35:22.563 --> 35:24.732
Nothing is more important
to me than you.

35:24.798 --> 35:26.600
I just have trouble
showing it.

35:28.202 --> 35:30.771
There's something else
going on, and sometimes

35:30.838 --> 35:33.639
I feel like it scares you
that I might get to the truth.

35:35.508 --> 35:36.809
Taxi!

35:42.015 --> 35:45.119
On second thought,
I think I'm gonna walk.

36:34.032 --> 36:36.567
I think I'm at the spot
where the killer emerged.

36:36.634 --> 36:38.669
I don't see
any sign of him.

36:38.736 --> 36:40.871
<i>I need to get back
to the others.</i>

36:40.939 --> 36:43.842
I've got the coordinates.
I'll let everyone know.

36:44.709 --> 36:46.312
Sorry for your loss, man.

36:49.648 --> 36:52.818
[snoring]

36:56.555 --> 36:57.888
[Ma Kent] I'm sorry.

36:57.956 --> 37:00.758
I guess we talked too much
tonight, didn't we?

37:00.825 --> 37:03.194
You were fine, Ma.

37:03.260 --> 37:06.297
We're getting old.
The secrets, uh...

37:06.363 --> 37:09.133
They don't seem as
important as they used to.

37:10.167 --> 37:14.406
They served a purpose.
Still do.

37:14.473 --> 37:18.876
She's a nice girl, Clark.
You deserve someone special.

37:18.943 --> 37:24.915
The problem is, the more special they
are, the more you want to protect them.

37:24.982 --> 37:29.853
I know. But you should have
choices like anyone else.

37:29.920 --> 37:33.656
We raised you so that
you could be yourself.

37:33.723 --> 37:36.192
We didn't raise you
to be alone, honey.

37:38.361 --> 37:40.029
I've never been alone.

37:40.096 --> 37:42.664
Not since the day
you and Pa took me in.

37:53.042 --> 37:54.744
[roaring]

37:59.415 --> 38:01.951
[growling softly]

38:04.686 --> 38:06.788
[whimpering]

38:14.831 --> 38:17.400
[growling]

38:19.035 --> 38:22.305
- [growling]
- [panting]

38:23.273 --> 38:25.674
[gasping]

38:25.741 --> 38:27.709
[growling, thudding]

38:31.513 --> 38:33.182
[yelps and gasps]

38:35.617 --> 38:38.686
[panting heavily]

38:38.753 --> 38:40.021
Brian?

38:41.623 --> 38:43.158
[gasping]

38:54.603 --> 38:56.737
[screaming]

39:04.078 --> 39:05.479
[Lois] Cat, please.

39:07.014 --> 39:08.583
At least let me
have my coffee first.

39:08.649 --> 39:11.152
[Cat] Abracadabra.
Here, caffeine, ingest and go.

39:12.887 --> 39:14.289
There's nothing to say.

39:15.056 --> 39:17.593
That's never true.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.728
Isn't there a Wayne or a
Kardashian you could be chasing?

39:20.795 --> 39:22.930
You, Kent,
the Kansas crew.

39:22.997 --> 39:25.299
Was he all nervous
and shaky like he gets?

39:25.366 --> 39:27.435
I gotta start
taking the stairs.

39:27.501 --> 39:30.671
- [elevator dings]
- Well, you know, he got here early.

39:30.737 --> 39:32.205
- Clark?
- [Cat] Yup.

39:32.272 --> 39:34.808
And he keeps finding
reasons to walk by your desk.

39:34.874 --> 39:36.677
Cat, seriously,
can you lay off?

39:36.743 --> 39:39.512
Things didn't go
quite as expected.

39:39.579 --> 39:41.948
Having you press buttons is
really not helping anything.

39:42.015 --> 39:43.684
- [shrieks]
- Lois!

39:43.750 --> 39:45.286
I stopped and got
you some...

39:46.454 --> 39:47.787
coffee.

39:50.757 --> 39:52.325
Should I leave?

39:52.392 --> 39:54.995
No, Cat. I was just looking
for a background

39:55.061 --> 39:57.896
on a Congressman
Lois interviewed last year.

39:57.964 --> 40:01.201
Maybe we can meet for lunch.
We need to talk.

40:01.268 --> 40:04.036
Okay. I can eat
around 2:00 p.m.

40:04.103 --> 40:06.305
[cell phone buzzing]

40:10.576 --> 40:13.013
That'd be great.
Whatever works for you, works for me.

40:13.079 --> 40:14.981
There's a place
in Hob's Bay.

40:16.650 --> 40:19.785
Get the address from Jimmy
and I'll meet you there.

40:22.689 --> 40:24.790
Wow!

40:24.857 --> 40:26.659
- So, what do you think?
- It's hard to say.

40:26.726 --> 40:30.229
He's nervous, that's for sure.
It could be nothing.

40:30.296 --> 40:33.098
You know how men
are, you never know.

40:34.366 --> 40:37.536
Hmm. Yeah,
you're in trouble.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.505
- I'm sorry.
- [gasps]

40:39.571 --> 40:43.342
Don't order a lot for lunch.
You don't wanna be bloated when, mmm...

40:43.409 --> 40:45.911
- [phone beeps]
- I got the alert. What's up?

40:45.978 --> 40:48.980
[Wonder Woman] Just wanted you to
know there's action in your zone.

40:49.048 --> 40:51.350
- [Superman] <i>Where?</i>
- I think we're okay for now.

40:51.417 --> 40:53.752
Flash and a few others
are already headed out.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.220
Initial reports are some
kind of creature.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.090
Arthur spotted something
off shore, might be related.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.592
I've got a lunch
with Lois but I'll cancel.

41:01.659 --> 41:03.728
We're good with who we have.

41:03.795 --> 41:07.632
This lunch wouldn't have anything to do
with what we were discussing the other day?

41:07.699 --> 41:09.701
Call if the League
needs me.

41:09.767 --> 41:13.137
Is that your way of saying,
"Mind your own business?"

41:13.639 --> 41:14.972
Yup.

41:19.043 --> 41:22.213
[police sirens blaring]

41:23.147 --> 41:25.383
[people screaming]

41:47.437 --> 41:48.972
[guns cocking]

42:02.918 --> 42:04.387
[groaning]

42:06.555 --> 42:11.427
[gasps]
It killed him. It killed him!

42:15.998 --> 42:17.967
[screaming]

42:22.806 --> 42:24.974
Oh, my God!
Goodness!

42:25.040 --> 42:28.042
If anyone's watching this,
send help.

42:28.110 --> 42:30.413
This monster's
killing everyone!

42:33.849 --> 42:35.950
[gasps]
Oh, no!

42:36.685 --> 42:38.019
No!

42:39.421 --> 42:40.488
[screams]

42:56.271 --> 42:58.773
[Batman] It's okay, kid.
We're here now.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.075
Flash, civilians!

43:06.915 --> 43:10.317
[grunting and groaning]

43:12.252 --> 43:15.356
- [sighs]
- [growls]

43:15.423 --> 43:16.524
[grunts]

43:22.530 --> 43:23.731
[hammer clatters]

43:25.466 --> 43:27.201
- [comm link beeps]
- Hawk's still alive.

43:27.267 --> 43:28.635
[Batman] <i>Lantern?
We need a perimeter.</i>

43:28.702 --> 43:31.205
Like hell! This is no time
for a rope-a-dope.

43:31.271 --> 43:33.973
I'm a member of
the Green Lantern Corps.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.743
We eat monsters
like this for breakfast.

43:37.644 --> 43:39.513
[police siren blaring]

43:40.747 --> 43:42.650
[roaring]

43:42.717 --> 43:46.119
[drilling]

43:50.924 --> 43:52.559
[grunts]

43:52.626 --> 43:54.561
[growling softly]

43:55.562 --> 43:59.632
[both grunting]

44:05.738 --> 44:07.306
[groaning]

44:07.373 --> 44:09.942
Okay, I didn't see
that coming.

44:10.008 --> 44:11.644
[roaring]

44:18.651 --> 44:20.453
[groaning]

44:24.357 --> 44:26.659
[breathing softly]

44:30.696 --> 44:32.063
[growls]

44:36.701 --> 44:38.703
[crackling]

44:42.842 --> 44:45.076
[grunts]

44:45.778 --> 44:47.647
[groans]

44:49.180 --> 44:52.250
[metal thudding]

44:59.089 --> 45:00.492
[blows landing]

45:01.793 --> 45:03.562
[yells]

45:06.630 --> 45:09.500
[groaning]

45:09.567 --> 45:11.769
[growling]

45:11.835 --> 45:13.103
[beeping]

45:13.872 --> 45:16.073
[growls]

45:16.140 --> 45:20.511
Alert. Three leaders down and we
only just got here. Need backup, now.

45:23.048 --> 45:25.316
[growling]

45:32.056 --> 45:36.660
[Lex] Dabney Donovan,
how's my hard-earned money being spent?

45:36.727 --> 45:41.130
Lex, why it's all in front of you.
Every penny.

45:42.533 --> 45:46.503
I'll stay here. I don't
do crazy very well.

45:46.570 --> 45:49.006
- Still carrying the gun?
- Oh yes.

45:49.073 --> 45:52.442
You never know when one of
my babies might break out.

45:52.508 --> 45:55.545
They get... confused.

45:56.746 --> 45:59.083
Any progress?

45:59.148 --> 46:04.354
Hit or miss, I expect to have more
obedient samples soon. Very soon.

46:04.420 --> 46:08.024
I don't want samples.
I want an army.

46:08.091 --> 46:10.425
It's difficult
replicating DNA.

46:10.492 --> 46:13.496
We need a more
durable code.

46:13.563 --> 46:16.100
Now, that creature
you told me about...

46:16.165 --> 46:19.669
We're tracking it down, Dabney.
Don't count your chickens.

46:21.004 --> 46:22.170
What about this one?

46:22.237 --> 46:24.641
This was to be the prototype.

46:24.707 --> 46:27.677
- It's still growing.
- Lex!

46:28.945 --> 46:30.212
We found it.

46:48.196 --> 46:49.398
[grunts]

46:52.334 --> 46:53.869
Fall, you bastard!

46:54.536 --> 46:55.737
[beeping]

47:02.978 --> 47:05.980
[growling]

47:06.048 --> 47:08.049
[Bibbo] <i>And then I says
to Superman, I says,</i>

47:08.115 --> 47:12.019
"Hit him with an uppercut.
Now counterpunch, counterpunch!"

47:12.086 --> 47:15.256
And that's pretty much how I helped
him save the city, more or less.

47:16.257 --> 47:18.126
That's quite a story.

47:18.192 --> 47:20.895
- I got a hundred of 'em.
- I'll bet you do.

47:20.962 --> 47:23.230
How about menus,
do you have any of those?

47:23.297 --> 47:25.433
Oh yeah. Here you go.
[chuckles]

47:25.499 --> 47:31.304
Try the ribs. It comes with super
sauce and a side of super slaw.

47:31.906 --> 47:33.406
Um, super!

47:36.376 --> 47:38.578
I'm sorry. Jimmy
loves this place.

47:38.645 --> 47:42.182
Jimmy Olsen eats
chili dogs for breakfast.

47:42.249 --> 47:45.351
So, what did you
want to talk about?

47:46.020 --> 47:47.688
Okay.

47:47.755 --> 47:50.557
The other day you said it
felt like I was holding back,

47:50.623 --> 47:52.358
like something was wrong.

47:53.226 --> 47:54.828
You were right.

47:54.894 --> 47:57.530
Okay. Glad to know
I'm not crazy.

47:57.597 --> 47:59.766
Well, this doesn't have
to be a bad break-up.

47:59.833 --> 48:01.501
I'm still gonna come
to work each day.

48:01.568 --> 48:03.435
If that's a problem,
it's on you to deal with. I...

48:03.503 --> 48:06.538
Wait, let me finish.

48:06.605 --> 48:08.607
There's a reason
why I'm so secretive.

48:10.709 --> 48:12.812
And I think you deserve
to know why.

48:13.880 --> 48:14.981
And?

48:17.249 --> 48:18.785
I'm Superman.

48:21.154 --> 48:23.489
[laughing]

48:23.555 --> 48:26.825
That's... That's good,
Clark. You got me.

48:32.397 --> 48:33.932
Look at me.

48:38.737 --> 48:40.538
Oh, my God!

48:41.874 --> 48:45.410
This is insane. But it makes
total sense. You...

48:45.477 --> 48:49.014
You always showed up around the same time.
It was like you were just there.

48:49.081 --> 48:51.483
And you were good,
too good.

48:51.550 --> 48:56.255
Oh, my God, this is so unethical.
You wrote stories about yourself.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.589
Well, yeah, but only
a couple of times.

48:58.656 --> 49:00.324
I really wanted the job.

49:00.391 --> 49:04.495
You never take vacations,
you never sweat, you never tan...

49:04.562 --> 49:07.465
[gasps] Are those people
even your parents?

49:07.532 --> 49:10.735
They are, but you know,
it's complicated.

49:10.802 --> 49:14.239
Oh, my God!
You're from another planet!

49:14.305 --> 49:16.774
[gasps] My boyfriend's
from another planet.

49:16.841 --> 49:21.712
Listen, Lois, I'm just a guy from a small
town who wants to do the right thing.

49:21.779 --> 49:25.149
But doing what I do could
put my family in danger.

49:25.216 --> 49:28.085
I did this so that they wouldn't
have to pay for my choices.

49:29.486 --> 49:32.290
And now you want me
to live with it, too.

49:32.355 --> 49:36.693
I hope you can, because there's
something else I've been keeping secret.

49:37.928 --> 49:41.498
- [cell phone ringing]
- You want to get that?

49:44.601 --> 49:47.905
[sighs] Jimmy, I'm busy.
Call back... What?

49:48.905 --> 49:51.275
What? Speak up,
I can't hear you.

49:51.374 --> 49:54.411
Chief wants you on the chopper.
I'll be right there!

49:54.477 --> 49:57.714
- What, why?
- A monster's heading towards Metropolis.

49:57.781 --> 50:00.717
He's already taken out
half the Justice League.

50:00.784 --> 50:02.786
- Well, I guess you must have heard...
- [coins jingling]

50:06.722 --> 50:07.756
...that.

50:19.302 --> 50:20.603
[distant boom]

50:27.109 --> 50:29.144
[chopper whirring]

50:37.920 --> 50:41.156
- [growling]
- [screaming]

50:42.325 --> 50:44.126
[roars]

50:46.962 --> 50:48.898
[grunting]

50:52.001 --> 50:53.601
[groaning]

50:56.305 --> 50:58.173
[growling]

50:58.240 --> 51:01.242
[panting]

51:01.309 --> 51:02.443
Can you tell what
he's thinking?

51:02.510 --> 51:04.411
No real thoughts.

51:04.478 --> 51:09.017
It's all aggression, all about the fight.
Killing machine.

51:13.322 --> 51:15.790
[roaring]

51:18.693 --> 51:20.995
No!
[groaning]

51:26.367 --> 51:28.802
[unearthly yelling]

51:31.406 --> 51:33.206
[whimpering]

51:39.179 --> 51:40.613
[growling]

51:41.381 --> 51:42.816
[metal creaking]

51:44.118 --> 51:45.819
Batman, heads up!

51:49.390 --> 51:51.191
[grunts and groans]

51:55.128 --> 51:56.797
[growling]

52:09.942 --> 52:13.612
Not looking too good, Cyborg.

52:13.679 --> 52:17.451
We can take this creep.
Come on! Let's...

52:17.516 --> 52:20.019
[groaning]

52:23.956 --> 52:26.625
Where is that monstrosity?

52:28.461 --> 52:31.629
South. Heading
towards Metropolis.

52:35.767 --> 52:37.602
We need you, Clark.

52:38.237 --> 52:40.638
[people screaming]

52:45.111 --> 52:47.380
I call you out, monster!

52:47.446 --> 52:49.048
[growling]

53:13.071 --> 53:15.040
[metal thudding]

53:18.510 --> 53:19.944
[grunts]

53:39.296 --> 53:41.298
[Wonder Woman]
I compel you to surrender!

53:42.566 --> 53:45.102
[grunts]

53:54.744 --> 53:57.914
[Wonder Woman] You may resist
the lasso, mindless creature.

53:58.948 --> 54:01.084
But by Hera,
you will fall!

54:15.566 --> 54:17.133
[yelling]

54:19.268 --> 54:20.803
[gasps]

54:22.638 --> 54:24.606
[groans]

54:43.326 --> 54:45.194
[groaning]

55:01.176 --> 55:02.210
Diana?

55:02.277 --> 55:04.212
I should have
gotten here sooner.

55:04.279 --> 55:07.848
[gasping] Not your fault.

55:07.915 --> 55:10.384
- [groans]
- You wait here, okay?

55:13.488 --> 55:17.225
Wait. Take him down, Clark.

55:18.560 --> 55:19.827
Don't hold back.

55:20.794 --> 55:22.997
Or he'll kill everyone.

55:24.165 --> 55:25.866
[groaning]

55:30.571 --> 55:32.306
[roaring]

55:34.674 --> 55:39.245
I don't know what hole you crawled
out of or where you came from,

55:40.648 --> 55:42.883
but I'm sending you back.

55:44.151 --> 55:46.220
[roaring]

55:54.928 --> 55:57.163
[straining]

56:04.571 --> 56:06.172
[growling]

56:07.806 --> 56:11.009
[people exclaiming]

56:11.076 --> 56:12.845
[grunts]

56:22.188 --> 56:23.523
[grunting]

56:23.590 --> 56:25.857
This creature has not been
identified by the government

56:25.924 --> 56:28.394
<i>and is rumored to have left
members of the Justice League</i>

56:28.461 --> 56:30.430
<i>wounded or near death
in Carlon Heights.</i>

56:30.496 --> 56:33.700
- [crowd chattering]
- Hey, if you ain't gotta place to go,

56:33.765 --> 56:37.735
you can stay with me while
Superman cleans this clown's clock.

56:37.802 --> 56:39.804
I'll be here for you.

56:41.206 --> 56:44.344
Just like my buddy Supes
is always there for us.

56:46.044 --> 56:48.213
Question is, will
Superman once again

56:48.280 --> 56:52.384
meet the challenge and keep this...
Doomsday out of Metropolis?

56:52.451 --> 56:54.219
- [phones ringing]
- You heard her, people,

56:54.286 --> 56:55.954
Lois has given
this thing a name.

56:56.021 --> 56:59.291
Doomsday. Let's get on it.
We need a new Page One.

56:59.358 --> 57:02.394
Yeah, if there's
anyone left to read it.

57:02.461 --> 57:05.029
[Lois] <i>Superman may be
the only hope Metropolis has.</i>

57:05.096 --> 57:08.032
<i>In the past,
that's always been enough.</i>

57:11.002 --> 57:13.871
Oh, please,
cry me a river.

57:16.475 --> 57:21.312
Fascinating. What kind of
civilization would produce that?

57:22.346 --> 57:25.483
It seems its only
function is destruction.

57:25.549 --> 57:29.453
Perhaps it's a weapon.
A first strike meant to wipe out all life

57:29.520 --> 57:31.788
on a planet for
a conquering force.

57:31.855 --> 57:34.725
[Mercy] That would explain
why it's come to Metropolis.

57:34.791 --> 57:37.093
It's drawn to
population centers.

57:37.160 --> 57:39.929
Who, besides me, would
send an apex predator here

57:39.996 --> 57:42.400
to kill the strongest
thing it could find?

57:45.869 --> 57:48.306
[Mercy] You think it might
kill Superman?

57:48.372 --> 57:50.974
It would save me
a lot of trouble.

57:56.747 --> 58:00.517
But what if the caped
wonder can't bring him down?

58:00.583 --> 58:03.553
Metropolis will still
need to be protected.

58:15.598 --> 58:21.137
Luckily, it's a day I've been
planning for a long time.

58:21.204 --> 58:23.640
[newscaster] <i>The United States
metahuman advisory department</i>

58:23.707 --> 58:26.543
<i>is recommending all civilians
head to safety zones.</i>

58:26.609 --> 58:28.510
[video game beeping]

58:29.912 --> 58:32.381
[rumbling]

58:34.583 --> 58:36.552
[whimpering]

58:36.618 --> 58:39.087
Get out of the car, get out of the car!
Come on!

58:43.693 --> 58:45.928
- [car alarms blaring]
- [people screaming]

58:45.994 --> 58:47.996

59:35.777 --> 59:39.045

59:50.758 --> 59:52.426
[grunts]

59:55.362 --> 59:57.664
- [woman screams]
- [man] Get out of here!

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.967
[grunts]

01:00:05.739 --> 01:00:07.607

[roaring and grunting]

01:00:43.242 --> 01:00:45.211
[woman] Somebody,
help my child!

01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:05.597
[groans]

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:09.367
Get back to your mom, son.
Everything's going to be okay.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:15.039
[police siren blaring]

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:07.490
Oh, man! Superman's
not looking good.

[powering down]

01:02:47.128 --> 01:02:48.664
Huh?

01:02:51.166 --> 01:02:53.501
[breathing heavily]

01:02:56.504 --> 01:02:58.807
[groans]

01:02:58.873 --> 01:03:00.408
- I've got you.
- [sighs]

01:03:00.475 --> 01:03:04.412
You've got me?
But who's got you?

01:03:04.479 --> 01:03:06.180
We need to call in
the cavalry.

01:03:06.246 --> 01:03:09.084
- [sirens blaring]
- I am the cavalry.

01:03:09.149 --> 01:03:10.584
[distant roaring]

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:19.294
You can't go back after
that thing. It's suicide!

01:03:19.361 --> 01:03:21.328
So was following
in a chopper.

01:03:24.866 --> 01:03:27.635
[roaring]

01:03:27.701 --> 01:03:30.404
- I have to get back to work.

01:04:27.493 --> 01:04:29.428
[Lois] Come on, Jimmy.

01:04:29.494 --> 01:04:33.198
[Lois] <i>At this point,
it's impossible to tell who's the victor.</i>

01:04:33.265 --> 01:04:36.334
<i>Though Superman has
come from behind before...</i>

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:38.837
[Lois gasps]

01:04:38.904 --> 01:04:40.305
[Lois cries out]

01:04:42.075 --> 01:04:43.576
[weapon powering up]

01:04:48.714 --> 01:04:51.984
[Lex] Lane, Olsen,
keep the camera rolling.

01:04:54.352 --> 01:04:56.354
You'll wanna get this.

01:04:58.757 --> 01:05:02.293
You think taking down the Justice
League is supposed to scare us?

01:05:04.129 --> 01:05:05.797
That happens once a week.

01:05:12.938 --> 01:05:16.240
I don't know where you've come
from, you alien scum.

01:05:20.277 --> 01:05:23.148
But you've picked
the wrong city.

01:05:23.215 --> 01:05:25.616
And the wrong human.

01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:29.687
Metropolis is,
and always has been,

01:05:29.754 --> 01:05:34.992
under the protection of Lex
Luthor, you son of a bitch!

01:05:35.059 --> 01:05:36.861
[growls]

01:05:38.328 --> 01:05:40.363
Now to get a piece of you.

01:05:42.067 --> 01:05:43.300
[growling]

01:05:52.143 --> 01:05:53.844
[groans]

01:05:53.911 --> 01:05:56.746
[Lex] Step back,
you freak of nature!

01:05:58.082 --> 01:06:01.218
No! Stay away from me.

01:06:01.284 --> 01:06:05.421
I'm Lex Luthor!
I'm supposed to win.

01:06:08.725 --> 01:06:11.528

- [groaning]

[growls]

01:08:46.379 --> 01:08:48.046

Stay with me.
Please, stay with me.

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:54.144
[sighs]

01:09:54.211 --> 01:09:58.815
That thing... is he?

01:09:58.882 --> 01:10:00.484
Yes.

01:10:00.549 --> 01:10:04.087
You did it.
You saved everyone.

01:10:07.556 --> 01:10:12.529
Good. It's all
I ever wanted.

01:10:15.631 --> 01:10:17.733
Except for you.

01:10:19.236 --> 01:10:24.006
What a lucky man I was.

01:10:33.783 --> 01:10:37.585
[tearfully]
No! No, no, no!

01:10:37.652 --> 01:10:40.822
[sobbing]

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.229
- [gasps]
- [Lois crying]

01:12:00.334 --> 01:12:03.203
[Mayor Booker] Superman was
an example that inspired us

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:08.508
to reach beyond ourselves,
to soar towards a better tomorrow.

01:12:08.575 --> 01:12:13.914
He was a hero to Metropolis but
more importantly, he was a friend.

01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:16.083
Really, sorry, sir.
I need you to step back a bit.

01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:18.585
[Mayor Booker] His powers
were truly amazing.

01:12:18.651 --> 01:12:21.020
Is she gonna be okay?

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:27.026
Yes, Officer. It's just
a big loss for everyone.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:31.663
Yeah, Superman was kinda
like family, wasn't he?

01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:34.400
Of course,
he didn't act alone.

01:12:34.467 --> 01:12:37.936
The Justice League also
put their lives on the line

01:12:38.003 --> 01:12:42.175
against this brutal,
incomprehensible evil.

01:12:42.241 --> 01:12:44.744
In many ways,
I'm sure they feel the loss

01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:48.114
of their leader and comrade,
most of all.

01:13:19.244 --> 01:13:23.315
And let us not forget the
quick action from Lex Luthor,

01:13:23.381 --> 01:13:27.218
who allowed Superman the time
he needed to save us all.

01:13:27.284 --> 01:13:30.454
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Lex Luthor.

01:13:41.366 --> 01:13:43.401
Thank you, Mayor Booker.

01:13:43.468 --> 01:13:47.204
It's no secret Superman
and I had our differences,

01:13:47.271 --> 01:13:50.074
but this wasn't
always the case.

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:53.544
You would be surprised all
the times he came to visit.

01:13:53.611 --> 01:13:57.147
The wisdom he would impart.

01:13:57.214 --> 01:14:01.284
I will miss those late night
chats on my balcony.

01:14:26.075 --> 01:14:31.179
For Superman,
always in our hearts.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:15:01.310
[Bibbo] <i>Hail Mary, full of
Grace, the Lord is with thee.</i>

01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:04.011
<i>Blessed are thou
among women</i>

01:15:04.078 --> 01:15:08.583
<i>and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:11.019
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,</i>

01:15:12.554 --> 01:15:15.324

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:18.993
<i>now and at the hour
of our death.</i>

01:15:19.594 --> 01:15:20.961
<i>Amen.</i>

01:15:24.899 --> 01:15:27.669
Why would you
let Superman die

01:15:27.736 --> 01:15:31.572
when a washed up old roughneck
like me goes on living?

01:15:34.007 --> 01:15:35.875
It ain't right, God.

01:15:35.942 --> 01:15:37.478
[sniffling]

01:15:39.547 --> 01:15:40.716
It just ain't right.

01:15:40.782 --> 01:15:43.250
[crying]

01:16:19.085 --> 01:16:22.255
[Lex] I don't understand your
hesitation, Dr. Klyburn.

01:16:22.322 --> 01:16:25.057
If S.T.A.R. Lab's research on
the alien corpse is complete,

01:16:25.124 --> 01:16:28.994
Project Cadmus is perfectly suited to
house it until it's ready for disposal.

01:16:29.061 --> 01:16:33.198
It's fine here. LexCorp just needs
to get the payload rocket ready

01:16:33.265 --> 01:16:35.267
so the government can get
this creature off planet

01:16:35.334 --> 01:16:37.202
before it lands
in the wrong hands.

01:16:37.269 --> 01:16:39.438
You know I've been
exonerated, yes?

01:16:39.505 --> 01:16:42.208
You and your S.T.A.R.
bureaucrats can't keep trying me

01:16:42.275 --> 01:16:44.143
for crimes I've been
cleared of.

01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:48.547
You may have been cleared, Luthor,
but no one thinks you're innocent.

01:16:48.615 --> 01:16:52.918
As far as I'm concerned, Cadmus is a
genetic pirate ship posing as research...

01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:54.453
[rumbling]

01:17:09.902 --> 01:17:12.171
Someone track it.
Where's it going?

01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:15.407
Up, up and away.

01:17:45.903 --> 01:17:47.438
[clanging]

01:18:31.847 --> 01:18:33.349
[Cat] No one's
touched a thing.

01:18:35.184 --> 01:18:39.087
I know. I just wanted to...
check in on him.

01:18:39.153 --> 01:18:42.859
You know, there's still a lot of
people missing after the battle.

01:18:42.926 --> 01:18:45.127
They're being found every day.

01:18:45.194 --> 01:18:47.029
Clark will show up.

01:18:47.096 --> 01:18:50.132
He's got the best reason
of all to return.

01:18:53.168 --> 01:18:55.004
Thanks, Cat.

01:18:55.069 --> 01:18:57.806
- [Jimmy] Louis! Good you're still here.
- Yeah. What's going on?

01:18:57.873 --> 01:18:59.274
Police scanners.
Come on!

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.010
Jim, I'm in no mood to chase
a story right now.

01:19:01.075 --> 01:19:03.511
You will be. Trust me!
You drive.

01:19:10.953 --> 01:19:12.655
[chattering on radio]

01:19:12.721 --> 01:19:15.123
- Is it true?
- [Maggie] You tell me.

01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:16.592
[gasps]

01:19:21.162 --> 01:19:23.164

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.639

01:19:58.398 --> 01:20:01.602

better known to us
as Superman.

01:20:15.882 --> 01:20:19.318
My guest is commentator,
G. Gordon Godfrey.

01:20:19.385 --> 01:20:20.921
Sir, you've
written an editorial

01:20:20.988 --> 01:20:23.757
in which you call on us
to reject so-called "Supers,"

01:20:23.824 --> 01:20:27.060
[chuckles] and effectively
become our own heroes.

01:20:27.126 --> 01:20:29.096
We have an infestation, Cat.

01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:30.830
It's out of control.

01:20:30.896 --> 01:20:33.099
[Cat] <i>You're writing about
the mysterious new Supermen.</i>

01:20:33.164 --> 01:20:34.800
[siren wailing

01:20:35.935 --> 01:20:37.268
[sinister chuckle]

[whimpering and grunting]

01:20:39.071 --> 01:20:40.606
[girl screams] Oh, Eric!

But they're actually
making a difference.

the <i>Excalibur</i> Shuttle crew?

01:21:04.262 --> 01:21:06.230

[camera shutter clicking]

01:21:36.794 --> 01:21:39.228
But, Cat, the point of
my editorial

01:21:39.296 --> 01:21:41.700
is to say that
it's time for human beings

01:21:41.766 --> 01:21:44.234
to stop relying on
Leagues and Titans,

01:21:44.301 --> 01:21:46.871
and start saving ourselves.

01:21:46.938 --> 01:21:49.440
So, we should each
be our own Superman?

01:21:49.506 --> 01:21:51.109
I mean, isn't that
exactly what

01:21:51.176 --> 01:21:52.376
[chuckles] these
guys are doing?

01:21:58.414 --> 01:21:59.983

Tell him, Snakey Doyle's

01:22:03.787 --> 01:22:05.655
We'll see him in
five to ten. [laughs]

Buck up, Troupe.

01:23:37.945 --> 01:23:39.613
Writing's fine,
just a crap headline.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:40.682
We'll fix it later.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.716

01:23:42.783 --> 01:23:44.385

Crime stats.
"Have the Supermen made us safer?"

01:23:48.589 --> 01:23:50.891
I love it. Change "Law
enforcement" to "Millennials"

01:23:50.958 --> 01:23:52.660
and "Crime stats"
to "Re-tweets."

01:23:52.726 --> 01:23:55.095
Are the Supermen trending?
Troupe?

01:23:55.162 --> 01:23:57.965
I was gonna go cover the
LexCorp charity gala tonight.

01:23:58.032 --> 01:23:59.967
Wrong.
You're covering the big launch

Watchtower.

01:24:01.901 --> 01:24:04.238

I love it! Kent?

01:24:14.849 --> 01:24:16.783

01:24:59.825 --> 01:25:01.093
[crying]

01:25:07.798 --> 01:25:08.866
[gasps]

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.671
[sobbing]

01:25:12.738 --> 01:25:14.506
[Ma Kent] It's okay, Lois.

01:25:14.573 --> 01:25:15.874
We've got you.

01:25:19.077 --> 01:25:20.913
Jimmy packed up his desk.

01:25:20.979 --> 01:25:25.250
He has a box, but I haven't
been to the <i>Planet</i> since...

01:25:25.317 --> 01:25:27.818
When I'm there,
it just reminds me he isn't.

01:25:29.388 --> 01:25:30.988
I should've called.

01:25:31.055 --> 01:25:32.556
I wanted to.

01:25:32.623 --> 01:25:35.425
I'm just glad
he finally fessed up.

01:25:35.492 --> 01:25:38.662
It was such a big secret
to keep from you.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.534
[voice shaking]
I loved him too.

01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:46.504
- I tried to tell him, but...
- Oh, honey...

01:25:47.104 --> 01:25:49.040
He knew.

01:25:49.106 --> 01:25:51.776
I just...
I can't believe he's gone.

01:25:51.842 --> 01:25:54.711
He might not be if you
watch that damn Grant woman.

01:25:54.778 --> 01:25:56.147
[sternly] Jonathan!

01:25:56.213 --> 01:25:57.814
Clark's body disappears,

01:25:57.881 --> 01:26:01.818
and suddenly these new Supermen
show up out of the blue.

01:26:01.885 --> 01:26:05.889
What if one of them
really is Clark, reborn?

01:26:05.956 --> 01:26:07.589
Not possible.

01:26:07.657 --> 01:26:09.326
I would know.

01:26:09.392 --> 01:26:11.896
Of course. I just mean...

01:26:11.963 --> 01:26:14.198
There are a lot of
unanswered questions.

01:26:15.899 --> 01:26:18.369
When Superman first
showed up in Metropolis,

01:26:18.436 --> 01:26:19.869
nobody knew
what to make of him,

01:26:19.936 --> 01:26:21.972
because nobody knew
what to ask him.

01:26:23.606 --> 01:26:24.975
I knew what to ask him.

01:26:27.576 --> 01:26:29.545
I know what to ask these guys!

01:26:30.779 --> 01:26:32.148
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

01:26:41.557 --> 01:26:43.525
[piano music playing]

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.129
I'm glad you called.

01:26:47.163 --> 01:26:48.797
I'm glad you came.

01:26:48.864 --> 01:26:51.000
I was hoping
you could help me.

01:26:51.066 --> 01:26:54.069
- I'm following...
- I never thought of us as rivals, you know.

01:26:55.904 --> 01:26:57.505
Are we?

01:26:57.572 --> 01:27:00.808
Kal-El and I
had a special bond,

01:27:00.876 --> 01:27:03.212
but you were
the love of Clark Kent's life.

01:27:04.979 --> 01:27:08.850
Anyway, I'm relieved he
finally told you everything.

01:27:09.684 --> 01:27:11.220
Apparently he didn't.

01:27:13.355 --> 01:27:15.024
I'm sorry. For an Amazon,

01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:17.960
I have surprisingly
few girl friends here.

01:27:18.027 --> 01:27:20.129
[inhales] So, I'm bad at this.

01:27:20.195 --> 01:27:23.031
It's okay. I don't have
many girl friends either.

01:27:25.099 --> 01:27:27.035
Anyway, the reason
I called is that

01:27:27.101 --> 01:27:29.470
I'm following the story
on the new Supermen

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:31.406
and I was hoping that

01:27:31.472 --> 01:27:33.908
you or the League might have some
inside information on these guys.

01:27:33.975 --> 01:27:36.576
Anonymous, deep background,

01:27:36.643 --> 01:27:39.414
just to help me
direct my efforts.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:43.051
So, you didn't invite me here
to grieve with you?

01:27:43.117 --> 01:27:44.619
As friends?

01:27:44.685 --> 01:27:46.154
Not really, no.

01:27:48.156 --> 01:27:49.689
Thank Hera!

01:27:49.756 --> 01:27:53.094
Despite my reputation,
I'm not good at being touchy-feely.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:57.532
Lois, I don't have anything
for you on the Supermen.

01:27:57.597 --> 01:27:59.032
I wish I did.

01:27:59.099 --> 01:28:00.467
Off the record,

01:28:00.535 --> 01:28:03.770
the League's been stretched
very thin since we lost Kal.

01:28:04.938 --> 01:28:06.406
I don't think
the world realized

01:28:06.473 --> 01:28:08.008
how much they
depended on him.

01:28:09.376 --> 01:28:10.677
I know the feeling.

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.813
[scoffs] No. I'm sorry, Lois.

01:28:12.879 --> 01:28:14.382
- I didn't...
- That's fine.

01:28:14.449 --> 01:28:15.916
Really.

01:28:15.982 --> 01:28:18.919
It feels good to talk to
someone who understands.

01:28:18.985 --> 01:28:21.121
I'm sorry to bother you
about the new Supermen.

01:28:21.188 --> 01:28:22.189
Forget I asked.

01:28:23.190 --> 01:28:24.257
Just between us,

01:28:24.324 --> 01:28:26.759
I like the brutal one
with the visor.

01:28:27.593 --> 01:28:30.663
But apparently I have a type.

01:28:32.098 --> 01:28:34.733
Anything else I can
get for you lovely ladies?

01:28:40.639 --> 01:28:42.509
Ice cream.

01:28:42.576 --> 01:28:44.076
Hmm.
Maybe you're not so bad

01:28:44.143 --> 01:28:45.845
at the girl friend
thing after all.

01:28:45.911 --> 01:28:47.680
And you, Lois Lane,

01:28:47.746 --> 01:28:49.315
have the heart of an Amazon.

01:28:51.517 --> 01:28:53.718
So, you wanna share a ride?

01:28:53.786 --> 01:28:56.122
[hesitatingly] Thanks,
I've kinda got my own.

01:28:56.188 --> 01:28:57.289
Would you mind?

01:28:59.458 --> 01:29:00.792
[whirring]

01:29:02.193 --> 01:29:03.228
[thunderclap]

01:29:04.996 --> 01:29:08.800
[hesitatingly] We should
do this again sometime.

01:29:09.835 --> 01:29:11.570
Lois, I know
in order to heal,

01:29:11.636 --> 01:29:15.141
you need to solve the
mystery of these Supermen.

01:29:15.207 --> 01:29:18.009
Just make sure you don't
lose yourself in the process.

01:29:33.491 --> 01:29:35.692
[smooth jazz music
playing in the background]

01:29:40.865 --> 01:29:42.066
Something wrong?

01:29:42.133 --> 01:29:44.335
No. Everything's on schedule.

01:29:44.402 --> 01:29:47.405
He's just a little...
handsy for me.

01:29:48.573 --> 01:29:50.441
He must get that
from you, Donovan.

01:29:53.844 --> 01:29:55.445
[indistinct chattering
and laughter]

01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:02.519
[man] Lois Lane?

01:30:02.586 --> 01:30:04.288
John Henry Irons.

01:30:04.354 --> 01:30:05.721
You interviewed me once.

01:30:05.788 --> 01:30:08.724
[stammering] Uh,
Dr. Irons! Right.

01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:19.203
I'm sorry,
would you excuse me?

01:30:20.604 --> 01:30:22.139
And there's my cue.

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:32.315
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:30:32.381 --> 01:30:36.352
once again, I want to thank you
all for giving so generously.

01:30:36.419 --> 01:30:39.822
Together, we will
rebuild our great city,

01:30:39.889 --> 01:30:43.826
and ensure that we never
wake to another Doomsday.

01:30:45.461 --> 01:30:47.063
You've seen him in the news,

01:30:47.129 --> 01:30:50.366
but you didn't know who was
bankrolling him until now.

01:30:50.933 --> 01:30:52.668
Ladies and gents,

01:30:52.734 --> 01:30:57.607
I give you LexCorp's
new Superman!

01:30:57.673 --> 01:31:00.842
[crowd exclaiming]

01:31:00.909 --> 01:31:02.444
[dramatic music playing]

01:31:03.912 --> 01:31:06.780
[applauding and cheering]

01:31:21.796 --> 01:31:23.898
Hello, ladies!

01:31:23.965 --> 01:31:25.966
If you want a hero
who can measure up,

01:31:26.034 --> 01:31:27.702
- I can...
- And I promise you

01:31:27.768 --> 01:31:29.638
that as long as
LexCorp exists,

01:31:29.704 --> 01:31:32.106
Superman lives.

01:31:32.172 --> 01:31:34.842
Metropolis will be protected.

01:31:34.908 --> 01:31:36.810
[audience applauds]

01:31:51.191 --> 01:31:53.427
[music continues
in the background]

01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:05.371
[beeping]

01:32:18.719 --> 01:32:21.220
Um, party's back that way.

01:32:22.489 --> 01:32:24.190
Oh, hello!

01:32:25.358 --> 01:32:26.359
Hello.

01:32:27.126 --> 01:32:28.995
I was looking for someone.

01:32:32.198 --> 01:32:34.200
[Lois] Mr. Donovan.

01:32:40.206 --> 01:32:41.474
Not here.

01:32:45.912 --> 01:32:47.113
[beeping]

01:32:48.548 --> 01:32:51.016
You look... familiar.

01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:56.656
You don't look
so bad yourself.

01:32:56.723 --> 01:32:58.490
Do you work down here?

01:32:58.557 --> 01:32:59.792
What do you do?

01:32:59.858 --> 01:33:01.526
Advanced genetics.

01:33:02.928 --> 01:33:05.163
Fragmenting
and manipulating DNA

01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:07.898
for molecular duplication

01:33:07.965 --> 01:33:09.935
and, ah, reproduction.

01:33:10.869 --> 01:33:14.106
Ooh! Sounds important.

01:33:14.172 --> 01:33:15.941
You don't think
a sophisticated clone

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:19.978
like LexCorp's new Superman out
there, just happens on its own.

01:33:20.545 --> 01:33:21.979
Clone?

01:33:22.046 --> 01:33:23.382
[Lex] That's right.

01:33:24.549 --> 01:33:26.016
[Donovan] Mr. Luthor.

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:28.285
- [stammering] I was just...
- Mouthing off.

01:33:28.352 --> 01:33:29.387
Again.

01:33:30.087 --> 01:33:31.823
Word of advice, Donovan.

01:33:31.889 --> 01:33:33.391
A man who can't keep secrets

01:33:33.457 --> 01:33:35.559
shouldn't sleep around
on his wife.

01:33:37.061 --> 01:33:38.729
[stammering] Lex,
I swear, I didn't.

01:33:38.796 --> 01:33:41.899
Of course, you did.
And I'll deal with you later.

01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:43.535
[softly] Get out.

01:33:46.404 --> 01:33:47.706
Ms. Lane,

01:33:47.773 --> 01:33:49.440
I'm hurt.

01:33:49.507 --> 01:33:52.143
I always assumed once Superman
was out of the picture,

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:53.943
you'd rebound with me.

01:33:54.478 --> 01:33:55.780
[loud crash]

01:33:55.846 --> 01:33:57.080
What the hell?

01:33:57.147 --> 01:34:00.651
[all screaming]

01:34:03.086 --> 01:34:04.387
[grunting]

01:34:15.131 --> 01:34:16.700
What do you
think you're doing?

01:34:16.767 --> 01:34:18.101
At this moment,

01:34:18.168 --> 01:34:21.304
I am answering a question
posed by Lex Luthor.

01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:23.807
Okay. Well,
here's another one.

01:34:23.874 --> 01:34:26.209
Why the hell are you here?

01:34:26.276 --> 01:34:29.111
Lex Luthor is
a known criminal.

01:34:29.178 --> 01:34:32.014
Criminals must be
eradicated. [whirring]

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.750
- Thank you.
- For what?

01:34:33.817 --> 01:34:36.385
[screaming]

01:34:41.858 --> 01:34:43.193
[Lois gasping]

01:34:51.099 --> 01:34:52.334
[Lois] Get down!

01:34:54.369 --> 01:34:57.172
Why, Ms. Lane, you do care.

01:34:57.239 --> 01:34:58.774
Call off your clones, Lex!

01:34:58.841 --> 01:35:00.542
Only the boy is mine.

01:35:00.609 --> 01:35:01.710
[whirring]

01:35:01.777 --> 01:35:02.778
[gasps]

01:35:02.845 --> 01:35:04.045
[whirring]

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:07.448
Sorry, pal.

01:35:08.817 --> 01:35:10.118
Crash my party,

01:35:10.887 --> 01:35:12.087
you get bounced.

01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:27.803
[crashing]

01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:31.239
You have been classified a
priority one criminal accessory.

01:35:31.305 --> 01:35:33.608
Surrender or be eradicated.

01:35:33.674 --> 01:35:35.008
[whirring]

01:35:37.445 --> 01:35:38.880
Well, you've been classified

01:35:38.946 --> 01:35:41.382
a priority one dirt-bag,
so, there!

01:35:43.317 --> 01:35:44.519
[grunting and choking]

01:35:45.453 --> 01:35:46.654
[screams]

01:35:48.856 --> 01:35:50.391
[whirring]

01:35:59.399 --> 01:36:00.600
[Lex cracking knuckles]

01:36:01.167 --> 01:36:03.169
[groaning]

01:36:08.207 --> 01:36:10.043
[panting] Yeah!

01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:12.680
You better run!
Jerk!

01:36:15.783 --> 01:36:17.384
[whirring sound intensifies]

01:36:18.184 --> 01:36:19.286
Uh-oh.

01:36:19.352 --> 01:36:21.054
[glass shattering]

01:36:27.627 --> 01:36:28.628
[loud clang]

01:36:35.568 --> 01:36:37.236
[angrily] Hey! I had that guy.

01:36:37.303 --> 01:36:40.105
By all means,
go to town, Superboy.

01:36:40.173 --> 01:36:42.542
It's Superman.

01:36:43.743 --> 01:36:46.846
[Steel] Okay, we can
do this the easy way

01:36:46.913 --> 01:36:48.347
or the hard way.

01:36:49.783 --> 01:36:50.783
[cocking]

01:36:52.184 --> 01:36:53.419
[clangs]

01:36:53.886 --> 01:36:55.087
[grunts]

01:37:00.659 --> 01:37:02.160
[grunting]

01:37:03.227 --> 01:37:04.495
[groaning]

01:37:10.836 --> 01:37:13.339
[loud thud]

01:37:13.405 --> 01:37:17.275
Surrender Luthor over
to Superman and this ends.

01:37:21.245 --> 01:37:22.614
That's enough.

01:37:26.484 --> 01:37:28.052
We may see it differently,

01:37:28.119 --> 01:37:29.253
but in the eyes of the law

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.522
Lex Luthor is not a criminal.

01:37:31.589 --> 01:37:34.659
The rule of law is
a rule you never break.

01:37:34.726 --> 01:37:37.227
And real justice
is everyone's right.

01:37:37.294 --> 01:37:39.865
Even the worst among us.

01:37:39.932 --> 01:37:41.733
Now, who the hell are you?

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:43.868
I'm Superman.

01:37:45.637 --> 01:37:47.739
There is only one Superman.

01:37:56.114 --> 01:37:57.314
[groans]

01:38:15.599 --> 01:38:17.135
[grunting]

01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:24.306
[whirring]

01:38:38.154 --> 01:38:39.823
[sirens blaring]

01:38:46.163 --> 01:38:48.531
[beeping]

01:39:08.083 --> 01:39:09.819
[Superboy] Oh! No problemo.

01:39:09.885 --> 01:39:11.554
Just doin' my job.

01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.989
Like the boss says,
as long as LexCorp exists,

01:39:14.056 --> 01:39:15.390
Superman lives.

01:39:15.457 --> 01:39:16.826
And I'm Superman.

01:39:16.892 --> 01:39:18.094
Me.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.794
[woman] There he is!
Over there.

01:39:19.861 --> 01:39:21.830
- [man 1] Over there! Over there!
- [man 2] That's him!

01:39:21.896 --> 01:39:25.233
- [reporter] Why are you here?
- [all clamoring]

01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:31.773
Nice work in there. Thank you.

01:39:32.907 --> 01:39:33.908
He got away.

01:39:33.975 --> 01:39:35.676
Yeah, so did we.

01:39:35.743 --> 01:39:37.478
What happened to
the man in steel?

01:39:38.712 --> 01:39:39.714
He took off.

01:39:40.982 --> 01:39:42.650
Lois Lane. <i>Daily Planet.</i>

01:39:45.086 --> 01:39:47.354
So, how old are you?

01:39:48.355 --> 01:39:49.858
Excuse me?

01:39:49.924 --> 01:39:51.226
How old are you?

01:39:51.291 --> 01:39:52.559
Old enough.

01:39:54.928 --> 01:39:56.296
Okay, babe. Hit me up.

01:39:58.499 --> 01:40:00.501
That was revolting.

01:40:03.137 --> 01:40:04.437
So do you mind telling me

01:40:04.504 --> 01:40:06.606
what the heck you were
doing in that lab?

01:40:06.672 --> 01:40:08.608
I used to work there.

01:40:08.674 --> 01:40:10.911
I suspect Lex has been
using tech I developed

01:40:10.978 --> 01:40:13.814
to retrofit weapons
for the black market.

01:40:13.881 --> 01:40:16.583
What the heck were
you doing with Donovan?

01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:20.721
Finding out that
Superboy is a clone.

01:40:20.788 --> 01:40:24.490
[Cat] <i>So why did you hide the fact that
your new Superman is actually a clone?</i>

01:40:24.557 --> 01:40:26.459
[Lex] <i>I never said
he wasn't a clone.</i>

01:40:26.526 --> 01:40:28.294
<i>I said he's Superman.</i>

01:40:28.361 --> 01:40:31.664
<i>And he is a Superman clone.</i>

01:40:31.731 --> 01:40:33.466
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me.</i>

01:40:37.703 --> 01:40:39.405
[robot 1] Do we wake him?

01:40:39.472 --> 01:40:41.507
[robot 2] No.

01:40:41.574 --> 01:40:44.777
Kal-El's last battle
left him severely depleted.

01:40:44.844 --> 01:40:47.814
We must not interrupt
his ion radiation transfer.

01:40:57.656 --> 01:40:59.925
<i>Lane's not explicitly
calling them fakes.</i>

01:40:59.992 --> 01:41:02.761
She's asking the questions
that need to be asked.

01:41:02.828 --> 01:41:05.497
After her stunning
LexCorp clone expose,

01:41:05.564 --> 01:41:06.832
<i>she's got our attention.</i>

01:41:10.169 --> 01:41:11.536
Hello, Ms. Lane.

01:41:13.705 --> 01:41:15.707
I guess you got my message?

01:41:16.408 --> 01:41:18.043
The whole city did.

01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:20.579
I feel terrible we
haven't been able to talk yet.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.682
On the record?

01:41:24.783 --> 01:41:26.618
But I thought
you'd be happy to see me.

01:41:27.319 --> 01:41:29.054
See who?

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.754
I don't know who you are.

01:41:31.422 --> 01:41:32.790
Lois, it's me!

01:41:34.159 --> 01:41:36.060
You look like Superman,

01:41:36.126 --> 01:41:37.628
but Superman died.

01:41:38.429 --> 01:41:39.731
In my arms.

01:41:40.832 --> 01:41:41.933
I did.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.268
For my people,

01:41:43.335 --> 01:41:45.369
death doesn't
have to be the end.

01:41:45.436 --> 01:41:48.073
Our technology was...
is...

01:41:48.139 --> 01:41:51.142
far beyond what
exists on Earth today.

01:41:51.209 --> 01:41:54.011
Part of that technology
is encoded in my genome.

01:41:54.945 --> 01:41:56.513
Before I died,

01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:59.917
I was able to activate it so that
it could rebuild and revive me.

01:42:01.018 --> 01:42:02.518
As a robot?

01:42:02.585 --> 01:42:03.988
I'm not a robot.

01:42:04.054 --> 01:42:06.890
These are just
artificial replacement parts.

01:42:06.956 --> 01:42:08.758
[sarcastically]
A cyborg Superman?

01:42:09.526 --> 01:42:11.095
Just Superman.

01:42:13.130 --> 01:42:14.164
Okay.

01:42:15.232 --> 01:42:16.767
What was your last secret?

01:42:18.135 --> 01:42:19.569
I don't know.

01:42:19.636 --> 01:42:22.805
Half my memories are gone
along with the rest of me.

01:42:22.872 --> 01:42:25.008
Then tell me
what you do remember.

01:42:26.409 --> 01:42:29.579
I remember we were close.

01:42:31.981 --> 01:42:34.017
How close?

01:42:34.083 --> 01:42:37.686
Enough that it hurts to have you
look at me like I'm a monster.

01:42:40.823 --> 01:42:42.725
The way you wrote about me...

01:42:42.792 --> 01:42:45.094
I never dreamed
I'd lose you like this.

01:42:46.596 --> 01:42:48.765
Especially not now when...

01:42:51.067 --> 01:42:53.202
terrible things
are coming, Lois.

01:42:53.269 --> 01:42:54.736
I can feel it.

01:42:54.803 --> 01:42:56.805
When the <i>Daily Planet</i>
said "Superman is dead,"

01:42:56.872 --> 01:42:59.207
it painted
a target on the Earth.

01:43:00.376 --> 01:43:01.977
Why did you come here?

01:43:02.844 --> 01:43:05.180
Because I need your voice.

01:43:05.247 --> 01:43:08.716
I can't protect the people if
they think I'm a fake, Lois.

01:43:08.783 --> 01:43:10.320
Even if you won't
believe I'm Superman

01:43:10.386 --> 01:43:13.189
at least believe that
I'm trying to do some good.

01:43:15.824 --> 01:43:17.693
And maybe write about that.

01:43:27.568 --> 01:43:30.471
[all clamoring]

01:43:35.609 --> 01:43:37.712
[all cheering]

01:43:51.492 --> 01:43:55.662
- [crowd cheering]
- [cameras clicking]

01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:16.850
[sternly] Get in.

01:44:17.517 --> 01:44:19.619
[cars honking]

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.688
- Just like you would any new product.
- [car windows opening, closing]

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:23.823
So far, all you've
managed to do is

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:26.026
- preen, and gallivant, and...
- [window humming]

01:44:27.994 --> 01:44:29.195
Stop that!

01:44:30.363 --> 01:44:31.530
Where's Mercy?

01:44:31.597 --> 01:44:34.367
Still in traction,
thanks to you.

01:44:34.434 --> 01:44:35.901
Have you seen the newspapers?

01:44:35.968 --> 01:44:37.736
Yeah, I've seen them
all over the place.

01:44:37.803 --> 01:44:39.839
Have you read them?

01:44:43.309 --> 01:44:44.744
Oh. Right on!

01:44:47.981 --> 01:44:50.616
This really reflects
more on you.

01:44:50.682 --> 01:44:52.452
Do you know
what they're calling you?

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:54.287
Superboy.

01:44:54.354 --> 01:44:57.156
But... I'm Superman.

01:44:57.222 --> 01:44:59.892
They didn't get the memo.

01:44:59.958 --> 01:45:03.295
This entire roll-out
has been a disaster.

01:45:03.362 --> 01:45:06.231
Goggles and the robot are
getting all the good press.

01:45:06.298 --> 01:45:10.135
While you're strutting across
TV screens like a clown.

01:45:10.202 --> 01:45:11.471
Don't you mean clone?

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.739
[sarcastically] Thanks for
the heads-up, by the way.

01:45:13.806 --> 01:45:15.274
Oh, please.

01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:17.608
So you were genetically engineered.
Who isn't?

01:45:17.675 --> 01:45:20.711
Little DNA from here, some from there.
Bam! You're born.

01:45:20.778 --> 01:45:21.980
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:26.884
The only difference between
you and a biological child

01:45:26.951 --> 01:45:29.488
is that I've invested
a hell of a lot more capital

01:45:29.555 --> 01:45:31.155
to bring you to the party.

01:45:32.056 --> 01:45:33.124
[window humming]

01:45:33.691 --> 01:45:34.892
[grunts]

01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:38.628
So, we are
going to start again.

01:45:38.695 --> 01:45:40.432
It's a relaunch.

01:45:40.499 --> 01:45:44.102
Superman 2.0.1.

01:45:46.337 --> 01:45:47.638
That's awful,

01:45:47.705 --> 01:45:49.941
but we'll let marketing
sort it all out.

01:45:50.007 --> 01:45:52.742
[sighs] What do you
want me to do?

01:45:52.809 --> 01:45:55.012
You've had your fun,
Superboy,

01:45:55.079 --> 01:45:57.614
but now it's time
to act like a man.

01:45:58.249 --> 01:45:59.649
I got you a gig.

01:46:07.157 --> 01:46:08.657
[siren blaring]

01:46:10.328 --> 01:46:12.263
[Batman] They just passed
Burnett Boulevard.

01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:15.600
Coming up on Rodeo.

01:46:15.665 --> 01:46:17.734
I think they say Ro-day-o.

01:46:17.801 --> 01:46:19.069
They're wrong.

01:46:19.136 --> 01:46:20.237
Lantern?

01:46:20.303 --> 01:46:21.606
[siren blaring]

01:46:21.671 --> 01:46:23.540
Yeah, I say Ro-day-o.

01:46:23.607 --> 01:46:24.875
- [Batman on radio] <i>Report!</i>
- Oh!

01:46:24.941 --> 01:46:27.643
[chuckles] Smooth
sailing up here. Flash?

01:46:27.710 --> 01:46:29.346
[whizzing]

01:46:29.412 --> 01:46:31.515
- I just wanna ask.
- [Green Lantern] <i>Ah, here it comes.</i>

01:46:31.581 --> 01:46:32.648
I'm just saying.

01:46:32.715 --> 01:46:33.949
Are we
presidential bodyguards,

01:46:34.016 --> 01:46:36.553
or are we the Justice League?

01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:38.420
Today, we're bodyguards.

01:46:38.487 --> 01:46:40.757
And you don't think there's
other stuff we should be doing?

01:46:40.824 --> 01:46:42.325
The Titans have it covered.

01:46:43.226 --> 01:46:44.760
The Teen Titans.

01:46:44.827 --> 01:46:47.796
[sarcastically] Oh, yeah!
I feel good about that.

01:46:47.863 --> 01:46:50.333
Chillax, Zippy.
The Titans are cool.

01:46:51.033 --> 01:46:52.034
Zippy?

01:46:52.101 --> 01:46:53.836
Wait.
Did he just say "Chillax"?

01:46:55.204 --> 01:46:56.972
Young man,
stay off this frequency.

01:46:57.039 --> 01:46:58.706
It's for League members only.

01:46:58.773 --> 01:47:00.909
No, it's for the
President's protective detail.

01:47:00.976 --> 01:47:03.445
As the new head
of LexCorp global security,

01:47:03.512 --> 01:47:04.846
I qualify.

01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:08.383
I have the shot.

01:47:09.451 --> 01:47:10.853
I say take it.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.354
That's enough.

01:47:12.421 --> 01:47:14.456
We have a job to do.

01:47:14.523 --> 01:47:16.225
Okay. Can we speed this up,

01:47:16.292 --> 01:47:18.693
because if I'm not home by
dinner, Iris is gonna kill me.

01:47:32.941 --> 01:47:35.742
[crowd cheering
and applauding]

01:47:35.809 --> 01:47:37.212
[cameras clicking]

01:47:54.395 --> 01:47:56.196
Someone should go say hi.

01:47:58.398 --> 01:48:00.400
[mumbling] I'm a
little busy right now.

01:48:03.036 --> 01:48:07.140
I don't really know him. Vic?

01:48:07.207 --> 01:48:09.577
Oh, so you think
all cyborgs know each other?

01:48:09.644 --> 01:48:11.579
Yes. But, in my defense,

01:48:11.646 --> 01:48:12.846
I'm horribly insensitive.

01:48:12.913 --> 01:48:14.248
[Superboy giggling on radio]

01:48:14.314 --> 01:48:15.650
Lex is so wrong.

01:48:15.717 --> 01:48:17.384
You guys are funky fresh.

01:48:17.451 --> 01:48:19.052
[Lex on radio] <i>Donovan's
been letting you watch</i>

01:48:19.119 --> 01:48:21.288
<i>those 90s
sitcoms again, I see.</i>

01:48:21.355 --> 01:48:22.322
Lex?

01:48:22.389 --> 01:48:24.091
[Lex] <i>I'm in your</i> other <i>ear.</i>

01:48:24.157 --> 01:48:26.092
<i>Reminding you to stay alert.</i>

01:48:26.158 --> 01:48:28.362
President Dale
has her eye on you.

01:48:28.428 --> 01:48:29.996
Keep her safe.

01:48:30.062 --> 01:48:32.798
By the end of the week,
with a little political maneuvering,

01:48:32.865 --> 01:48:34.934
she'll be
publicly recognizing you

01:48:35.001 --> 01:48:38.070
<i>as the one true Superman.</i>

01:48:40.906 --> 01:48:42.908
Yesterday, my husband said,

01:48:42.975 --> 01:48:45.445
"Joan, why do you
have to do this?"

01:48:45.512 --> 01:48:47.346
And I said,

01:48:47.413 --> 01:48:51.183
"Because I stand with the Justice
League as they have stood with us."

01:48:51.250 --> 01:48:52.752
[whirring]

01:48:52.818 --> 01:48:54.819
[Dale speaking distantly]
Really, I'm thrilled to be here.

01:48:54.886 --> 01:48:56.122
To help dedicate

01:48:56.188 --> 01:48:58.758
the Justice League's
new Watchtower.

01:48:58.823 --> 01:49:00.293
A proud...

01:49:00.359 --> 01:49:01.993
[loud thud]

01:49:06.632 --> 01:49:07.733
Madam President...

01:49:07.799 --> 01:49:08.801
[gasps]

01:49:08.868 --> 01:49:10.169
I've got you, ma'am.

01:49:10.236 --> 01:49:11.870
I've got her, everyone!

01:49:15.073 --> 01:49:16.941
[screeching and growling]

01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:19.712
[voice shaking] Uh, Lois?

01:49:19.779 --> 01:49:21.580
- [crowd screaming]
- [shouting] Everybody clear out!

01:49:25.517 --> 01:49:29.387
Kid, if I find out LexCorp had
anything to do with this...

01:49:29.454 --> 01:49:31.955
Look, Mr. Roboto,
we got bigger problems.

01:49:32.022 --> 01:49:33.258
The boy's right.

01:49:35.493 --> 01:49:36.894
Let's go.

01:49:44.336 --> 01:49:45.836
[grunting]

01:49:53.877 --> 01:49:55.412
[crowd screaming]

01:50:00.718 --> 01:50:02.619
[whizzing]

01:50:02.686 --> 01:50:04.053
[crowd screaming]

01:50:20.604 --> 01:50:22.272
[growling]

01:50:23.906 --> 01:50:26.810
Watch your step.
Come on. No rush.

01:50:26.876 --> 01:50:29.078
[all exclaiming]

01:50:29.145 --> 01:50:30.546
[stammering] Uh,
a little rush, actually.

01:50:30.613 --> 01:50:31.914
[screeching]

01:50:37.085 --> 01:50:38.388
[cracking]

01:50:42.992 --> 01:50:44.160
Hey, metal head!

01:50:44.227 --> 01:50:45.561
You wanna lend a hand?

01:50:52.968 --> 01:50:54.570
[crowd screaming]

01:50:56.773 --> 01:50:58.106
[groans]

01:50:59.074 --> 01:51:00.610
- [loud thud]
- [screaming]

01:51:00.676 --> 01:51:02.010
[guns cocking]

01:51:04.146 --> 01:51:07.482
[loud thuds and groaning]

01:51:10.085 --> 01:51:12.522
[gasps, screams]

01:51:12.588 --> 01:51:13.589
[growls]

01:51:17.926 --> 01:51:19.127
[screams]

01:51:21.029 --> 01:51:23.031
[metal groaning]

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.835
Superman?

01:51:26.902 --> 01:51:29.236
At your service,
Madam President.

01:51:32.139 --> 01:51:33.708
Time to get you out of here.

01:51:38.279 --> 01:51:41.283
[buzzing and shattering]

01:52:00.801 --> 01:52:02.001
[gasps]

01:52:11.579 --> 01:52:14.148
[all exclaiming]

01:52:30.129 --> 01:52:32.232
We're still reeling from
the latest alien attack,

01:52:32.298 --> 01:52:35.535
and the devastating loss
of the Justice League.

01:52:35.602 --> 01:52:37.504
President Dale will
speak at a memorial

01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:39.472
in Centennial Park
to honor the fallen.

01:52:39.539 --> 01:52:42.041
Alongside the man
whose heroic actions

01:52:42.108 --> 01:52:43.878
have proven to us all

01:52:43.944 --> 01:52:47.480
that he truly is
Superman, reborn.

01:52:47.547 --> 01:52:49.147
[voice shaking]
And let me just say,

01:52:49.215 --> 01:52:51.417
it feels good
to have him back.

01:52:51.484 --> 01:52:52.886
[shattering]

01:52:52.952 --> 01:52:54.721
[grunts]

01:52:54.787 --> 01:52:56.856
Couldn't find the remote?

01:52:56.923 --> 01:52:59.124
[angrily] That
is not Superman.

01:52:59.191 --> 01:53:01.560
We had a real
opportunity here!

01:53:01.627 --> 01:53:03.028
A real opportunity,

01:53:03.095 --> 01:53:04.663
and you blew it!

01:53:08.835 --> 01:53:10.168
Come along, son.

01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:13.539
Lex, is...

01:53:15.307 --> 01:53:19.711
Hey, I did what you told me to do.
Everything I'm capable of doing.

01:53:20.779 --> 01:53:22.748
And you still lost.

01:53:26.150 --> 01:53:28.754
I gave you every
advantage Superman had,

01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:30.655
and more.

01:53:30.722 --> 01:53:31.823
And I appreciate...

01:53:31.890 --> 01:53:33.524
Wait, more?

01:53:33.591 --> 01:53:34.625
Wait here.

01:53:41.767 --> 01:53:43.067
I remember this place.

01:53:44.068 --> 01:53:45.469
[Donovan] There you are.

01:53:47.338 --> 01:53:49.640
Dr. Donovan?
What happened to you?

01:53:50.641 --> 01:53:52.009
You father is a...

01:53:52.109 --> 01:53:53.644
- [beeps]
- ...hard man.

01:53:59.850 --> 01:54:01.117
My father?

01:54:01.184 --> 01:54:02.720
Do you mean Superman?

01:54:02.787 --> 01:54:04.287
I don't work for Super...

01:54:05.188 --> 01:54:07.290
Oh, no.

01:54:07.357 --> 01:54:10.061
I thought he would've
told you. I, uh...

01:54:10.127 --> 01:54:11.228
I didn't mean to...

01:54:11.295 --> 01:54:13.096
[Lex] Well, look who's talking.

01:54:14.699 --> 01:54:16.232
[sternly] Again!

01:54:16.299 --> 01:54:18.535
[voice shaking]
Mr. Luthor, please!

01:54:18.602 --> 01:54:20.503
What's going on?

01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:23.074
It's all right, Dabney.
Tell him.

01:54:23.139 --> 01:54:25.042
What difference
could it make now?

01:54:25.141 --> 01:54:27.243
- I don't think I...
- Tell him!

01:54:29.211 --> 01:54:31.915
The DNA, your DNA,

01:54:31.982 --> 01:54:33.950
- its...
- Superman's.

01:54:34.017 --> 01:54:38.054
[hesitatingly]
Yes, but also...

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:40.256
I told you I gave you more.

01:54:41.391 --> 01:54:44.794
All of Superman's
strength, plus

01:54:44.861 --> 01:54:47.497
all the Luthor intellect.

01:54:49.032 --> 01:54:50.934
Supposedly.

01:54:51.001 --> 01:54:52.668
He just needs guidance.

01:54:52.736 --> 01:54:55.972
Please! We got so much
closer with this one

01:54:56.039 --> 01:54:57.506
than any of the others.

01:54:58.474 --> 01:54:59.942
[sighs] You're right, Dabney.

01:55:00.009 --> 01:55:01.209
The current model really is

01:55:01.276 --> 01:55:04.079
leaps and bounds
ahead of his brothers.

01:55:04.145 --> 01:55:06.280
- [vial shattering]
- I don't know what I was thinking.

01:55:06.815 --> 01:55:07.916
Let's go.

01:55:16.692 --> 01:55:18.127
And Dabney,

01:55:18.192 --> 01:55:19.495
you're fired.

01:55:19.561 --> 01:55:20.729
[beeping]

01:55:20.796 --> 01:55:21.864
[beeping]

01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:31.372
[growling and screeching]

01:55:34.142 --> 01:55:35.576
[gasping]

01:55:37.445 --> 01:55:40.049
No! No! [screams]

01:55:40.115 --> 01:55:43.284
[gunshots and screaming]

01:55:43.351 --> 01:55:45.319
Still can't keep
his mouth shut.

01:56:07.941 --> 01:56:10.645
[high-pitched shrill]

01:56:10.712 --> 01:56:12.245
[groaning]

01:56:15.682 --> 01:56:19.286
If you're through indulging
in this emotional nonsense,

01:56:19.352 --> 01:56:21.488
we have work to do,

01:56:22.155 --> 01:56:23.590
Superman.

01:56:27.094 --> 01:56:29.361
Yes, master.

01:56:36.902 --> 01:56:38.171
It was him.

01:56:38.238 --> 01:56:39.906
Well, half of him, anyway.

01:56:40.607 --> 01:56:42.642
Was he with anyone else?

01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:44.878
Only her.

01:56:50.449 --> 01:56:52.451
[Lois] Terri Henshaw.

01:56:52.518 --> 01:56:54.620
He was pretty out of it.

01:56:54.687 --> 01:56:56.222
Stood there half the night

01:56:56.288 --> 01:56:58.090
talkin' to the air.

01:56:58.157 --> 01:57:00.760
Looked tormented.

01:57:00.826 --> 01:57:03.963
'Course, that's not
unusual around here.

01:57:05.965 --> 01:57:07.532
It is for Superman.

01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:22.847
[beeping]

01:57:36.426 --> 01:57:38.831
[metal clanging]

01:57:49.641 --> 01:57:51.042
[Lois] It's about time
you showed up.

01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:52.543
What the...

01:57:52.609 --> 01:57:54.311
Yeah, you shouldn't leave
your bathroom window open.

01:57:54.378 --> 01:57:55.779
Anyone could get in here.

01:57:58.315 --> 01:57:59.917
So, I got a lead
at the cemetery

01:57:59.983 --> 01:58:01.652
that I think we should...

01:58:01.718 --> 01:58:03.587
John?

01:58:03.654 --> 01:58:06.256
You know that
I know you're Steel, right?

01:58:06.322 --> 01:58:08.693
And I'm literally the
worst at secret identities.

01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.129
I mean,
if you couldn't fool me...

01:58:11.196 --> 01:58:13.097
[sighs]

01:58:13.164 --> 01:58:14.731
Superman saved my life, once.

01:58:15.399 --> 01:58:17.235
Now that he's gone,

01:58:17.302 --> 01:58:19.102
I owe it to him
to fill the void.

01:58:19.169 --> 01:58:20.237
[beeps]

01:58:20.304 --> 01:58:22.005
[mechanical whirring]

01:58:28.111 --> 01:58:29.846
Neat!

01:58:29.912 --> 01:58:31.614
What did you find
at the cemetery?

01:58:31.681 --> 01:58:32.782
[typing]

01:58:34.584 --> 01:58:37.787
[Steel] Terri Henshaw?
The astronaut?

01:58:37.854 --> 01:58:39.790
She was on
the <i>Excalibur,</i> right?

01:58:39.857 --> 01:58:43.227
Yup. Can you access the S.T.A.R.
Labs' mainframe from here?

01:58:43.293 --> 01:58:44.493
[typing]

01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.029
If the cyborg's
telling the truth,

01:58:46.096 --> 01:58:47.430
that he really is Superman,

01:58:47.496 --> 01:58:49.932
then why would he
go to Terri Henshaw's grave?

01:58:49.999 --> 01:58:51.167
This is odd.

01:58:51.234 --> 01:58:54.070
It says Henshaw's remains
were never recovered.

01:58:54.136 --> 01:58:57.572
Sorry. Remains were
recovered for Terri Henshaw,

01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:59.641
but not for Hank Henshaw.

01:58:59.708 --> 01:59:01.110
[softly] The Henshaws.

01:59:01.177 --> 01:59:02.510
Of course!

01:59:03.578 --> 01:59:05.046
The husband
and wife astronauts.

01:59:05.114 --> 01:59:06.481
We did a huge story on them.

01:59:06.548 --> 01:59:08.584
They were both
assigned to the <i>Excalibur.</i>

01:59:08.651 --> 01:59:12.054
So, it was the husband's body
that was never found.

01:59:12.121 --> 01:59:13.623
It's him, John.

01:59:13.689 --> 01:59:16.158
It's why he was
visiting Terri's grave.

01:59:16.225 --> 01:59:17.525
[sighs] I don't know how,

01:59:17.592 --> 01:59:20.829
but the cyborg Superman
is Hank Henshaw.

01:59:24.532 --> 01:59:26.835
[crowd cheering
and applauding]

01:59:37.578 --> 01:59:39.114
[cameras clicking]

01:59:44.319 --> 01:59:45.620
Huh?

01:59:53.328 --> 01:59:54.628
[President Dale] <i>Superman?</i>

01:59:55.930 --> 01:59:57.531
[crowd cheering]

02:00:02.303 --> 02:00:03.370
I...

02:00:03.436 --> 02:00:04.872
I don't think...

02:00:12.713 --> 02:00:15.849
The Justice League
were the best among us.

02:00:15.916 --> 02:00:18.886
As such, they would
want us to celebrate today.

02:00:18.953 --> 02:00:20.321
Not mourn.

02:00:20.387 --> 02:00:21.922
Yet, here we are.

02:00:21.989 --> 02:00:25.292
Surrounded by reminders
in stone of the mournful times

02:00:25.359 --> 02:00:27.394
that have befallen our world.

02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:31.130
It's only by a miracle of alien
science that I am here today.

02:00:31.197 --> 02:00:35.668
Alive. Standing in for
the real heroes we lost

02:00:35.735 --> 02:00:37.502
[Superman] During
the Doomsday battle,

02:00:37.569 --> 02:00:39.039
the Watchtower attack,

02:00:39.106 --> 02:00:41.541
and too many
other bloody incursions.

02:00:41.607 --> 02:00:43.776
We need to shut
this asshole down.

02:00:43.843 --> 02:00:46.413
How? He's Superman to them.

02:00:46.479 --> 02:00:49.682
I could try to pitch the Henshaw
story to Perry White, but

02:00:49.749 --> 02:00:51.918
without any evidence,
he won't go near it.

02:00:52.617 --> 02:00:54.387
Which is why today,

02:00:54.454 --> 02:00:58.291
I am announcing the establishment of a
new, stronger League.

02:00:58.358 --> 02:00:59.691
A Cyborg Corp,

02:00:59.758 --> 02:01:01.526
to honor those
who have perished

02:01:01.593 --> 02:01:03.829
in the name of justice,

02:01:03.895 --> 02:01:05.831
and I'm taking volunteers.

02:01:05.897 --> 02:01:08.935
- [crowd murmuring]
- What the hell?

02:01:10.003 --> 02:01:12.504
- I volunteer.
- What?

02:01:13.306 --> 02:01:15.041
But I don't have any power.

02:01:16.175 --> 02:01:17.410
No one has.

02:01:17.477 --> 02:01:19.578
Not really.

02:01:19.644 --> 02:01:22.247
But I can change all that
if you come forth.

02:01:23.515 --> 02:01:25.117
Eric, no!

02:01:25.751 --> 02:01:27.419
Becky, please.

02:01:27.486 --> 02:01:29.087
This could change everything.

02:01:29.154 --> 02:01:31.223
For the world, for us.

02:01:38.263 --> 02:01:39.664
Welcome to the team.

02:01:42.401 --> 02:01:44.002
[whirring and beeping]

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:50.175
[crowd exclaiming]

02:01:53.478 --> 02:01:57.481
I can give each of you the
power to be your own hero.

02:01:57.547 --> 02:01:59.682
The same technology
that saved me,

02:01:59.750 --> 02:02:01.285
can save us all.

02:02:07.191 --> 02:02:08.859
[crowd exclaiming]

02:02:08.926 --> 02:02:11.662
Doomsday was only
the beginning.

02:02:11.729 --> 02:02:13.998
Our enemies
haven't been destroyed.

02:02:14.065 --> 02:02:15.066
Only delayed.

02:02:15.132 --> 02:02:16.467
When they return,

02:02:16.534 --> 02:02:18.335
who will stand
and fight with me?

02:02:21.072 --> 02:02:22.872
[crowd murmuring]

02:02:22.939 --> 02:02:25.309
This is it.
This is his plan.

02:02:25.376 --> 02:02:27.043
How the hell did Hank Henshaw

02:02:27.110 --> 02:02:29.045
get his hands
on that kinda tech?

02:02:29.112 --> 02:02:31.681
Intergang's been running
Luthor's Apokolips tech.

02:02:31.748 --> 02:02:33.083
I can get to them.

02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:35.418
Find out if they have
ties to Cyborg Superman.

02:02:35.485 --> 02:02:36.819
Sounds like a plan.

02:02:36.885 --> 02:02:38.755
I'll go lean on Lex.

02:02:42.725 --> 02:02:44.127
[beeping]

02:02:54.037 --> 02:02:55.938
[whirring]

[Snakey Doyle]
Take your time, boys.

02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:24.166
Ain't nobody watchin'
the store today. [laughs]

02:03:37.145 --> 02:03:39.414
So you're saying that's
the way to Hob's Bay?

02:03:42.683 --> 02:03:43.885
[gasps]

02:03:44.586 --> 02:03:45.887
Eric?

02:03:45.953 --> 02:03:47.255
[child] Can you fly?

02:03:48.256 --> 02:03:49.724
[children laughing]

02:03:53.594 --> 02:03:54.862
[gasps and thuds]

02:03:56.330 --> 02:03:58.299
[Becky] Oh, come on!
Not again!

02:04:00.501 --> 02:04:02.303
[panting]

02:04:02.370 --> 02:04:03.703
[thuds]

02:04:07.909 --> 02:04:10.044
I believe this belongs to you.

02:04:10.111 --> 02:04:11.379
My hero.

02:04:13.314 --> 02:04:15.949
Do you require
further assistance?

02:04:16.016 --> 02:04:18.018
Eric. It's me, Becky.

02:04:18.785 --> 02:04:19.920
Are you okay?

02:04:19.986 --> 02:04:22.923
I haven't heard
from you in days.

02:04:22.989 --> 02:04:25.792
Okay, stop it.
You're scaring me.

02:04:25.859 --> 02:04:28.794
Have a pleasant day, citizen.

02:04:28.862 --> 02:04:31.131
Eric? Eric!

02:04:44.511 --> 02:04:46.913
Doyle, I know you're here.

02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:48.747
I'm not looking for trouble.

02:04:48.814 --> 02:04:50.650
I just need information
on some alien tech

02:04:50.716 --> 02:04:51.951
you may have unloaded.

02:04:52.686 --> 02:04:53.886
What the hell?

02:04:54.753 --> 02:04:56.722
[all groaning]

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:02.494
What happened here?

02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:05.130
Superman cleaned us out.

02:05:05.863 --> 02:05:07.199
The one in the shades.

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:09.302
The Eradicator?

02:05:09.369 --> 02:05:11.036
[groaning] Here.

02:05:11.103 --> 02:05:13.272
Traces on our stuff.

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.976
You can catch up with him
if you hurry.

02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:19.844
Go get him.

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:22.448
Don't wait up.

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:28.219
[siren wailing
in the distance]

02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:33.091
[door opening]

02:05:35.159 --> 02:05:36.827
We both know
you took me down there

02:05:36.893 --> 02:05:38.697
to get rid of Superboy
for good.

02:05:38.763 --> 02:05:41.700
I don't know what
changed you mind, but...

02:05:41.766 --> 02:05:42.967
[footsteps approaching]

02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:46.838
Oh. I thought you were...

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:48.707
Let me guess.

02:05:48.773 --> 02:05:50.308
You thought I was Lex Luthor.

02:05:54.746 --> 02:05:57.682
Lookin' for ol' cue ball.
Know where he is, Superboy?

02:05:57.749 --> 02:05:59.149
Don't call me that!

02:06:07.491 --> 02:06:08.493
What's wrong?

02:06:09.427 --> 02:06:10.561
He's my father.

02:06:10.628 --> 02:06:13.698
At least, he's half my DNA.

02:06:13.765 --> 02:06:15.165
I just found out.

02:06:16.401 --> 02:06:17.669
Nah, I don't buy it.

02:06:17.735 --> 02:06:19.369
I mean, the hair alone.

02:06:22.572 --> 02:06:24.541
Wow. You do look like him.

02:06:25.442 --> 02:06:26.876
Superman, I mean.

02:06:29.479 --> 02:06:31.914
Look, I was a jerk
when I met you, Lois.

02:06:31.981 --> 02:06:33.182
I'm sorry.

02:06:34.183 --> 02:06:35.251
I don't know why, but...

02:06:35.318 --> 02:06:37.086
I feel like I can talk to you.

02:06:39.523 --> 02:06:40.524
I know why.

02:06:41.891 --> 02:06:43.593
[cell phone buzzing]

02:06:45.595 --> 02:06:47.163
Yeah.

[Steel] <i>Eradicator's

02:06:48.931 --> 02:06:50.966

<i>I'm tracking him now.</i>

02:06:52.736 --> 02:06:54.370
All right. Keep me posted.

02:07:24.032 --> 02:07:25.867

02:07:25.934 --> 02:07:27.369
[robot] Greetings.

02:07:27.435 --> 02:07:29.971
Uh, greetings?

02:07:30.038 --> 02:07:31.506
[robot] Kal-El is unavailable

02:07:31.573 --> 02:07:34.209
as he nears completion
of his revitalization cycle.

02:07:34.275 --> 02:07:36.378
Thank you for your patience.

02:07:36.444 --> 02:07:37.912
[Steel] Kal-El?

02:07:37.979 --> 02:07:40.014
So it really is you.

02:07:56.997 --> 02:07:58.098
[shouts] Whoa, Steel!

02:07:58.165 --> 02:07:59.533
What's happening?

02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:01.001
Little busy here, Lois.

02:08:01.068 --> 02:08:02.603
You called me.

02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:04.838
Sorry. Butt dial.

02:08:04.904 --> 02:08:06.206

What the hell
is going on, here?

02:08:32.866 --> 02:08:33.966
Give me that.

02:08:34.033 --> 02:08:35.101
Oh, don't!

- Is that...
- Kal-El's ship!

02:08:45.044 --> 02:08:46.379
From S.T.A.R. Labs.

02:08:49.015 --> 02:08:51.284
He needs help. I'm going.

02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:52.151
No.

02:08:52.218 --> 02:08:53.486
These cyborg thingies

02:08:53.553 --> 02:08:55.455
are popping up
all over the city.

02:08:55.521 --> 02:08:57.723
- [loud thud]
- It's gonna take a turn and I need you here.

02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:59.659
You're not the
boss of me, Lex.

02:08:59.725 --> 02:09:01.427
I literally am.

02:09:07.098 --> 02:09:09.502
You cannot harm
the data matrix.

02:09:09.569 --> 02:09:11.404
The data matrix?

02:09:12.405 --> 02:09:13.406
[grunts]

02:09:17.175 --> 02:09:19.277
John! It's a hologram!

02:09:19.344 --> 02:09:21.346
It's designed to
protect Kryptonians.

02:09:22.849 --> 02:09:25.050
[Steel] <i>I don't see any
Kryptonians around here.</i>

02:09:25.116 --> 02:09:26.318
<i>Do you?</i>

02:09:28.086 --> 02:09:29.521
Oh, my god!

02:09:29.588 --> 02:09:30.722
John, he's...

02:09:32.891 --> 02:09:34.526

<i>My stratagem has

02:09:59.583 --> 02:10:02.453
Soon, Earth
will be christened

02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:05.956
by Darkseid as New Apokolips.

02:10:06.022 --> 02:10:07.357
And this time,

02:10:07.423 --> 02:10:09.761
there's no Justice League

02:10:09.828 --> 02:10:13.230
or Superman to stop me.

02:10:13.297 --> 02:10:16.333
All that remains is
for you to open the gates.

02:10:26.309 --> 02:10:28.278
[Bibbo] All you gotta do is
look out the window

02:10:28.344 --> 02:10:30.280
to see things
ain't right no more.

02:10:31.147 --> 02:10:32.849
I knew Superman.

02:10:32.916 --> 02:10:34.584
Superman was my pal.

02:10:34.651 --> 02:10:37.688
And those things
ain't Supermen.

02:10:39.322 --> 02:10:42.660
They're not even
the people they used to be.

02:10:42.726 --> 02:10:46.229
[hesitatingly] I mean,
at least they're keeping the peace, right?

02:10:46.296 --> 02:10:48.598
You know that
ain't gonna last.

02:10:48.665 --> 02:10:49.832
We can't wait until

02:10:49.899 --> 02:10:52.134
after this thing takes
a turn for the worse.

02:10:52.201 --> 02:10:54.370
By then, it'll be too late!

02:10:54.437 --> 02:10:56.973
The robot said
one thing right.

02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:00.576
He said, "We gotta
be our own heroes."

02:11:00.642 --> 02:11:03.312
People are protesting
down at the Watchtower.

02:11:03.378 --> 02:11:05.080
Getting to be quite a crowd.

02:11:05.147 --> 02:11:07.450
What are we waitin' for?

02:11:07.517 --> 02:11:10.653
Together, we may not be
able to bring the beat down,

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:13.556
but we sure as hell
can make some noise.

02:11:13.623 --> 02:11:14.624
Am I right?

02:11:20.997 --> 02:11:23.832

[sighs] Last one for now.

02:11:43.752 --> 02:11:44.820
Any luck?

02:11:45.754 --> 02:11:46.722
No.

02:11:46.788 --> 02:11:48.456
Systems are
operating normally,

02:11:48.522 --> 02:11:50.926
but for some reason I can't
open a boom tube here.

02:11:50.993 --> 02:11:52.660
Any idea where "here" is?

02:11:52.727 --> 02:11:55.129
I don't recognize
any of these star formations.

02:11:55.196 --> 02:11:56.464
J'onn?

02:11:56.530 --> 02:11:58.299
They're foreign
to me as well.

02:11:58.366 --> 02:12:00.568
That's because
they're not stars.

02:12:00.635 --> 02:12:02.235
[Green Lantern]
What are they?

02:12:02.302 --> 02:12:04.437
[screeches]

02:12:05.572 --> 02:12:06.707
Hungry.

02:12:06.774 --> 02:12:08.242
I'm just gonna
hide behind the Amazon

02:12:08.309 --> 02:12:10.144
till Vic gets us home.

02:12:10.211 --> 02:12:11.412
There's nothin' doin', guys.

02:12:11.479 --> 02:12:13.047
Unless someone
from the other side

02:12:13.115 --> 02:12:14.682
reaches out to bring us back...

02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:17.752
we are home.

I can't find a signal.

Even after redirecting
every LexCorp satellite.

02:13:21.814 --> 02:13:23.415
So,

02:13:23.482 --> 02:13:25.884
do you really think
Kal-El is alive?

02:13:27.418 --> 02:13:28.419
I don't know.

02:13:28.486 --> 02:13:30.555
But, for the first time,

02:13:30.621 --> 02:13:32.958
I really feel
like it's possible.

02:13:33.025 --> 02:13:34.559
[Lex] For the first time,

02:13:35.426 --> 02:13:36.928
I hope he is.

02:13:39.364 --> 02:13:41.265
Now, there's something
you need to see.

[keyboard clacking]

02:13:55.313 --> 02:13:56.914
It's really you, isn't it?

02:13:58.816 --> 02:14:00.417
How?

02:14:00.484 --> 02:14:03.620
[Superman] Honestly,
I don't know.

02:14:03.687 --> 02:14:07.226
The robots keep calling it
a revitalization cycle.

02:14:07.291 --> 02:14:10.394
But it's not something I'd ever
heard of or knew was possible.

02:14:10.461 --> 02:14:11.829
[robots whizzing]

02:14:13.296 --> 02:14:14.866
What is this place?

02:14:14.932 --> 02:14:16.134
A fortress.

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:19.871
Built to keep me isolated
during this... process.

02:14:22.572 --> 02:14:25.308
Does he have to
just stand there like that?

02:14:25.375 --> 02:14:27.077
It's creepin' me out.

02:14:27.144 --> 02:14:28.979
He's just
trying to protect me.

02:14:29.045 --> 02:14:30.680
Then why was he
drawing energy from you

02:14:30.747 --> 02:14:32.281
while you were in the pod?

02:14:32.348 --> 02:14:34.084
[robot] Quite the reverse.

02:14:34.151 --> 02:14:39.356
Kal-El was the one absorbing ion
radiation from the Eradicator

02:14:39.422 --> 02:14:42.125
as part of
the revitalization cycle.

02:14:42.193 --> 02:14:43.426
Highly advanced tech

02:14:43.493 --> 02:14:46.096
programmed to
protect my people.

02:14:46.163 --> 02:14:47.463
So, he decided
to put on a cape

02:14:47.531 --> 02:14:49.565
and dispense his
own brand of justice?

02:14:54.804 --> 02:14:55.971
I'm just saying.

02:14:58.040 --> 02:14:59.508
[robots whirring]

02:14:59.575 --> 02:15:02.178
Well, I can't tell you how
glad I am to see you again.

02:15:02.244 --> 02:15:04.046
There's a lot
you need to know.

02:15:04.113 --> 02:15:06.581
These broadcasts have
brought me up-to-speed.

02:15:06.648 --> 02:15:08.450
Darkseid killed my friends,

02:15:08.517 --> 02:15:10.319
and people are
being turned into monsters

02:15:10.386 --> 02:15:12.255
by that cyborg impostor.

02:15:12.321 --> 02:15:13.889
Hank Henshaw.

02:15:15.192 --> 02:15:16.293
The astronaut?

02:15:16.358 --> 02:15:17.793
I thought he was dead.

02:15:19.427 --> 02:15:21.831
I guess I didn't
know everything.

02:15:21.897 --> 02:15:23.631
[Superboy] There's
a lot of that goin' around.

02:15:27.368 --> 02:15:29.571
So, what's the plan

02:15:30.705 --> 02:15:31.706
Dad?

02:15:34.809 --> 02:15:36.343
[whizzing]

02:15:38.013 --> 02:15:39.380
<i>And this time</i>

02:15:39.447 --> 02:15:41.382
<i>there's no Justice League</i>

02:15:41.449 --> 02:15:44.586
<i>or Superman to stop me.</i>

02:15:44.652 --> 02:15:48.456
<i>All that remains is
for you to open the gates.</i>

02:15:48.523 --> 02:15:50.158
Ever since the League's
"accident,"

02:15:50.225 --> 02:15:53.728
my satellites have intercepted
strange encoded signals.

02:15:53.795 --> 02:15:55.263
It's some kind of
holographic interface

02:15:55.330 --> 02:15:58.900
Darkseid is beaming
directly into Henshaw's head.

02:15:58.967 --> 02:16:02.036
He's literally messing
with his mind.

02:16:03.304 --> 02:16:04.504
Once Superman was gone,

02:16:04.571 --> 02:16:06.073
he cleared out
the Justice League,

02:16:06.139 --> 02:16:08.443
created an army of cybernetic
minions, and now...

02:16:08.509 --> 02:16:11.411
They open the gates.

02:16:11.478 --> 02:16:14.548
How do we even
begin to fight that?

02:16:14.615 --> 02:16:16.317
I might have something.

02:16:16.383 --> 02:16:17.584
Is it a plan?

02:16:17.651 --> 02:16:19.753
Because, what we
really need is a plan.

02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:21.455
The plan is to stop Darkseid,

02:16:21.521 --> 02:16:23.290
and save Henshaw.

02:16:23.358 --> 02:16:25.626
And get the girl.
Slash girls.

02:16:25.692 --> 02:16:27.661
Until your regeneration
is complete,

02:16:27.728 --> 02:16:30.964
I must insist you abstain
from sexual activity.

02:16:32.266 --> 02:16:35.369
Um, all right?

02:16:35.433 --> 02:16:37.537
You're not fully
powered yet, are you?

02:16:39.439 --> 02:16:40.741
For how long?

02:16:41.941 --> 02:16:43.010
I don't know.

02:16:44.645 --> 02:16:45.946
Maybe forever.

02:16:49.049 --> 02:16:50.683
After Darkseid's
first invasion,

02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:51.851
you couldn't
walk down the street

02:16:51.918 --> 02:16:54.120
without tripping
over alien tech.

02:16:54.186 --> 02:16:56.888
[laughs sarcastically] Yeah,
tech that you gave Intergang.

02:16:58.156 --> 02:16:59.258
Gave?

02:16:59.325 --> 02:17:02.028
You really don't
get me, do you?

02:17:02.093 --> 02:17:04.330
[sarcastically] And anyway,
you're welcome.

02:17:04.397 --> 02:17:06.031
Because that
business arrangement

02:17:06.098 --> 02:17:07.134
is what brought us...

02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:08.200
[whirring]

02:17:10.536 --> 02:17:11.771
This beauty.

02:17:13.239 --> 02:17:14.507
A Mother Box?

02:17:14.573 --> 02:17:15.975
We just have to activate it

02:17:16.041 --> 02:17:18.878
outside the Watchtower
at exactly the right spot.

02:17:18.945 --> 02:17:21.846
Unfortunately, the Tin Man's
got eyes everywhere.

02:17:21.914 --> 02:17:23.514
One of us will
have to go inside

02:17:23.581 --> 02:17:24.849
and keep him occupied

02:17:24.915 --> 02:17:27.485
while the other turns this on.

02:17:27.552 --> 02:17:29.587
Okay. Show me how it works.

02:17:30.555 --> 02:17:32.290
[laughs]

02:17:32.357 --> 02:17:33.523
Are you insane?

02:17:33.590 --> 02:17:36.227
I'm not going in there,
you are.

02:17:39.965 --> 02:17:40.898
Kal-El,

02:17:40.966 --> 02:17:43.134
I must insist on
accompanying you.

02:17:43.201 --> 02:17:44.769
[Steel] Bad idea.

02:17:44.835 --> 02:17:46.471
This guy's a wild card.

02:17:51.942 --> 02:17:55.313
Maybe a wild card
is what we need.

02:17:55.379 --> 02:17:59.183
What we need is a way
to get you to Metropolis.

02:17:59.250 --> 02:18:02.085
It's 40 below outside,
and you're just a guy now.

02:18:06.489 --> 02:18:08.492
A guy with a spaceship.

02:18:09.227 --> 02:18:10.827
[rumbling]

02:18:24.875 --> 02:18:26.442
Slammin'!

02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:27.843
Excuse me?

02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:30.013
Do people not
say that anymore?

02:18:34.683 --> 02:18:36.052
[all shouting]

02:18:36.119 --> 02:18:38.922
[Bibbo shouting]
We are not machines!

02:18:44.527 --> 02:18:47.164
[all shouting]

02:18:50.266 --> 02:18:51.800
[Lex] Listen, Lane.

02:18:53.969 --> 02:18:56.239
- I just wanna say...
- Thank you?

02:18:57.206 --> 02:18:58.639
Don't screw up.

02:19:01.877 --> 02:19:04.280
[Lois] Hey, you two.
Over here.

02:19:05.214 --> 02:19:06.214
[whizzing]

02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:08.584
Take me to your boss.

02:19:11.154 --> 02:19:15.191
Seriously. A room-full
of hungry Bizarros.

02:19:15.258 --> 02:19:16.625
Sounds harrowing.

02:19:16.691 --> 02:19:18.559
So, can I
live with you or not?

02:19:18.627 --> 02:19:19.861
Guys, I'm getting
an incoming call

02:19:19.928 --> 02:19:21.696
from a LexCorp number.
Could be Lois.

02:19:21.763 --> 02:19:23.098
I'm bouncing it over.

02:19:26.234 --> 02:19:28.202
<i>Oh! It's you.</i>

02:19:29.704 --> 02:19:30.839
Lex Luthor.

02:19:30.906 --> 02:19:32.772
As I live and breathe.

02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:35.410
Yeah, what's that about?

02:19:35.477 --> 02:19:36.877
Where's Lois?

02:19:36.945 --> 02:19:38.380
As much as I'd love to chat,

02:19:38.448 --> 02:19:40.082
I'm only calling
to ask sonny boy

02:19:40.147 --> 02:19:42.784
<i>if he wouldn't mind
popping by for a stretch.</i>

02:19:42.851 --> 02:19:44.686
I'm downtown
in the thick of it,

02:19:44.753 --> 02:19:46.587
and, well I could
use some muscle.

02:19:46.654 --> 02:19:48.056
The boy stays with me,

02:19:48.123 --> 02:19:51.126
and I need to know now
that Lois is all right.

02:19:51.193 --> 02:19:52.360
Oh, she's fine.

02:19:52.427 --> 02:19:53.828
She's in the Watchtower.

02:19:54.463 --> 02:19:55.663
What?

02:20:00.835 --> 02:20:02.635
[Darkseid] To
think that all this

02:20:02.703 --> 02:20:05.906
was made possible
when my Doomsday weapon

02:20:05.973 --> 02:20:09.244
obliterated your
primitive spacecraft.

02:20:09.311 --> 02:20:12.113
I plucked your
lifeless corpse from the void,

02:20:12.179 --> 02:20:15.182
and handed you
a chance for glory.

02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:18.319
Yes, your grace.

02:20:18.385 --> 02:20:21.721
And all because
a Kryptonian failed you.

02:20:23.257 --> 02:20:24.458
Even in death

02:20:24.525 --> 02:20:26.160
he will pay for his crimes.

02:20:27.694 --> 02:20:29.597
To capture glory, Henshaw,

02:20:29.662 --> 02:20:31.798
you must first
understand that sorrow,

02:20:31.865 --> 02:20:34.000
rage, and the thirst
for vengeance,

02:20:34.067 --> 02:20:37.538
are essential parts
of the equation.

02:20:37.605 --> 02:20:38.805
[man] Sir?

02:20:40.441 --> 02:20:41.641
[angrily] What now?

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:48.414
Leave us.

02:20:54.587 --> 02:20:56.222
Dr. Frankenstein.

02:20:56.289 --> 02:20:57.789
Or is it his monster?

02:20:57.856 --> 02:20:59.292
So easy to get mixed up.

02:21:00.593 --> 02:21:02.761
Frankenstein wanted
to play god.

02:21:03.695 --> 02:21:05.330
Do I look like I'm playing?

02:21:06.465 --> 02:21:09.369
You're gonna lose, Hank.

02:21:09.435 --> 02:21:11.770
Hank Henshaw's dead.

02:21:11.837 --> 02:21:14.340
Just like your beloved
knight in blue tights.

02:21:15.441 --> 02:21:16.742
[gasps]

02:21:16.808 --> 02:21:18.710
[choking]

02:21:18.777 --> 02:21:22.681
Of all the things I learned
on your balcony that night,

02:21:22.748 --> 02:21:24.316
- [panting]
- I think the most important

02:21:24.383 --> 02:21:27.718
was the true nature of your
relationship with Superman.

02:21:27.785 --> 02:21:30.656
A relationship, I'm afraid,

02:21:30.721 --> 02:21:33.325
that's about to meet
a tragic end.

02:21:33.392 --> 02:21:35.360
[groaning]

02:21:35.427 --> 02:21:38.897
[computer] <i>Alert! Watchtower
detecting an incoming ballistic rocket</i>

02:21:38.964 --> 02:21:40.499
<i>of Kryptonian origin.</i>

02:21:40.566 --> 02:21:41.867
<i>Enlarging view.</i>

02:21:45.770 --> 02:21:47.272
[Cyborg Superman] Superman.

02:21:49.308 --> 02:21:50.942
I knew you'd come.

02:21:51.809 --> 02:21:52.877
[gasps]

02:21:52.944 --> 02:21:55.346
- [siren blaring]
- [grunting]

02:21:55.413 --> 02:21:57.014
[shouting] No! Not now!

02:21:57.081 --> 02:22:00.117
So, my Doomsday weapon failed,

02:22:00.184 --> 02:22:03.054
and the
Kryptonian still lives.

02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:05.389
[shouting] Get out of my head!

02:22:05.456 --> 02:22:07.559
[breathing heavily]

02:22:07.626 --> 02:22:09.193
[Darkseid] Yes!

02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:12.396
I shall enjoy
killing the man of steel

02:22:12.463 --> 02:22:14.031
all over again.

02:22:14.098 --> 02:22:18.135
This time, with my bare hands.

02:22:18.202 --> 02:22:21.606
[shouts] No! Superman
is mine to destroy!

02:22:21.672 --> 02:22:23.708
We disagree.

02:22:23.773 --> 02:22:25.643
Open the gates!

02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:28.679
Prepare for my arrival.

02:22:28.745 --> 02:22:30.480
[whirring]

02:22:32.682 --> 02:22:34.451
[groaning]

02:22:36.721 --> 02:22:39.189
[voice shaking]

02:22:40.023 --> 02:22:42.460
[shouting] No!

02:22:42.526 --> 02:22:44.461
[growling]

02:22:46.796 --> 02:22:48.465
[beeping]

02:22:49.699 --> 02:22:51.334
[all beeping]

02:22:56.539 --> 02:22:58.941
[indistinct shouting]

02:23:01.410 --> 02:23:02.878
What the hell?

02:23:10.953 --> 02:23:13.122
[electricity crackling]

02:23:14.557 --> 02:23:16.825
[all screaming]

02:23:35.778 --> 02:23:37.446
[all exclaiming]

02:23:44.819 --> 02:23:47.055
[all exclaiming]

02:23:57.665 --> 02:24:00.468
[shouting] For Apokolips!

02:24:00.535 --> 02:24:02.337
[growling]

02:24:09.711 --> 02:24:12.613
No! Not yet! Not now!

02:24:13.448 --> 02:24:14.582
[softly] My God!

02:24:19.286 --> 02:24:21.088
I thought Superman was yours.

02:24:23.557 --> 02:24:26.059
You just gonna
hand him to Darkseid?

02:24:26.126 --> 02:24:28.261
[scoffs] Wow.

02:24:29.596 --> 02:24:32.332
[pulsating]

02:24:33.933 --> 02:24:36.001
[breathing heavily]

02:24:36.503 --> 02:24:39.473
[growls]

02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:42.876
[metal squeaking]

02:24:50.217 --> 02:24:53.219
[grunting, screaming]

02:25:18.878 --> 02:25:20.945
[pulsating]

02:25:23.449 --> 02:25:24.683
What?

02:25:24.750 --> 02:25:26.652
[growls] Henshaw!

02:25:32.791 --> 02:25:34.626
[yells] No!

02:25:40.566 --> 02:25:43.234
Now that they've been
cut-off from Darkseid,

02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:46.037
the Cyborg Corps
is mine to control.

02:25:46.104 --> 02:25:47.439
And I've just ordered them

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:50.575
to destroy Superman's
precious Metropolis.

02:25:53.778 --> 02:25:55.580
[whizzing]

02:25:59.751 --> 02:26:01.418
[beeping]

02:26:01.485 --> 02:26:02.687
Ah, come on!

02:26:05.756 --> 02:26:08.092
This is it! [growls]

02:26:09.828 --> 02:26:12.062
- Light 'em up!
- [all cheer]

02:26:20.971 --> 02:26:22.806
[rattling]

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:25.576
I've sacrificed
everything, now,

02:26:25.642 --> 02:26:27.544
just to kill him.

02:26:27.611 --> 02:26:29.979
But not before
I've made him watch

02:26:30.046 --> 02:26:32.716
as I tear you limb from limb.

02:26:34.918 --> 02:26:37.387
Even he can't save you.

02:26:37.454 --> 02:26:39.022
[whirring]

02:26:39.924 --> 02:26:41.258
[groans]

02:27:08.384 --> 02:27:11.654
[whimpering]
[screaming]

02:27:15.791 --> 02:27:17.593
[alarm beeping]

02:27:18.728 --> 02:27:20.161
Ah, come on!

02:27:20.228 --> 02:27:21.664
What am I doing wrong?

02:27:25.267 --> 02:27:26.701
[Steel] Excuse me.

02:27:27.669 --> 02:27:29.304
Mind if we kick your ass?

02:27:33.608 --> 02:27:35.142
[keypad beeping]

02:27:36.277 --> 02:27:37.480
[sarcastically]
You're welcome!

02:28:01.769 --> 02:28:04.705
[Lois panting]

02:28:09.010 --> 02:28:10.845
The napkin at Bibbo's.

02:28:12.547 --> 02:28:14.148
What was your last secret?

02:28:17.718 --> 02:28:18.852
I love you.

02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:21.021
Clark!

02:28:21.088 --> 02:28:23.190
[sighs] I love...
[gasps]

02:28:25.392 --> 02:28:28.494
Sorry to interrupt
this tender moment.

02:28:28.562 --> 02:28:32.165
Hank, you have to stop this.
Darkseid is...

02:28:32.231 --> 02:28:34.467
No longer
your biggest problem.

02:28:41.642 --> 02:28:43.577
[screams]

02:28:43.644 --> 02:28:46.046
Stay here.
I'll take care of you later.

02:28:46.112 --> 02:28:48.114
[Superman] Over my dead body.

02:28:52.019 --> 02:28:53.586
[shattering]

02:28:53.653 --> 02:28:57.256
It isn't too late.
There's always a way out.

02:28:57.323 --> 02:28:59.191
[shouting]
How about for my wife?

02:28:59.257 --> 02:29:01.094
[choking]

02:29:01.159 --> 02:29:02.795
Was there a way out for her?

02:29:11.105 --> 02:29:12.872
[bones cracking,
Superman groaning]

02:29:22.048 --> 02:29:24.117
Is this what Terri would want?

02:29:24.182 --> 02:29:25.717
[shouts] Don't say her name!

02:29:29.621 --> 02:29:31.923
You're not allowed
to say her name.

02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:33.825
She's dead because of you.

02:29:38.563 --> 02:29:41.299
She was always
apprehensive in space.

02:29:41.366 --> 02:29:43.969
She tried to hide it,
but I knew.

02:29:44.036 --> 02:29:45.504
I told her she'd be okay.

02:29:45.570 --> 02:29:47.773
We all would.
We had Superman.

02:29:50.075 --> 02:29:51.810
Until we didn't.

02:29:51.877 --> 02:29:54.712
Until my ship and
my crew were debris.

02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:56.915
[shouts] And you
weren't even dead, yet!

02:30:00.985 --> 02:30:02.586
Just too busy.

02:30:17.268 --> 02:30:19.770
[panting]

02:30:25.042 --> 02:30:26.242
[gasps]

02:30:38.756 --> 02:30:40.858
[choking]

02:30:40.925 --> 02:30:42.358
All you hear today

02:30:42.425 --> 02:30:45.361
is, "How do we live in
a world without Superman?"

02:30:45.428 --> 02:30:47.831
Well, some of us
already had to.

02:30:47.897 --> 02:30:49.499
Some of us watched

02:30:49.566 --> 02:30:50.700
as everything we had,

02:30:50.767 --> 02:30:53.636
everything we loved, was lost.

02:30:53.703 --> 02:30:55.437
[Lois] Oh, give it a rest!

02:30:55.972 --> 02:30:57.506
Huh?

02:30:57.573 --> 02:30:59.809
This isn't about
your wife and you know it.

02:31:00.442 --> 02:31:02.444
It's about you.

02:31:02.511 --> 02:31:05.181
You let Darkseid
turn you into this.

02:31:05.247 --> 02:31:07.584
Superman turned me into this.

02:31:07.650 --> 02:31:11.688
Darkseid only rebuilt me and taught
me how to wield my hatred as a weapon.

02:31:11.755 --> 02:31:14.891
- Just like he'd done with...
- Doomsday.

02:31:14.958 --> 02:31:17.861
That beast was only
a mindless assassin.

02:31:17.927 --> 02:31:20.763
While I was set to
a singular purpose.

02:31:20.829 --> 02:31:23.832
Destroy what
remains of Superman.

02:31:23.899 --> 02:31:25.434
His good name.

02:31:25.501 --> 02:31:28.269
It was the best revenge
I could hope for.

02:31:29.437 --> 02:31:30.639
Until now.

02:31:33.474 --> 02:31:36.512
[grunting and screaming]

02:31:54.929 --> 02:31:56.030
This is nuts!

02:31:56.097 --> 02:31:57.932
We should be
in there helping Superman.

02:31:57.999 --> 02:31:59.901
If you can find
a way past these guys,

02:31:59.967 --> 02:32:01.401
I'm right behind ya.

02:32:01.468 --> 02:32:03.470
[alarm blaring]

02:32:06.474 --> 02:32:07.575
[alarm blaring]

02:32:07.642 --> 02:32:09.343
I need a power source.

02:32:14.982 --> 02:32:17.552
[electricity buzzing]

02:32:29.529 --> 02:32:31.364
[alarm beeping]

02:32:34.167 --> 02:32:36.771
[machine activating]

02:32:42.642 --> 02:32:45.345
Luthor! What
the hell have you done?

02:32:52.953 --> 02:32:55.856
Robo people? Come on!
How long were we gone?

02:32:55.922 --> 02:32:57.023
[Lex] Finally!

02:32:57.090 --> 02:32:59.692
Luthor? You brought us back?

02:32:59.758 --> 02:33:01.694
Don't add me
to your friends list yet.

02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:04.096
This was purely
a business move.

02:33:04.163 --> 02:33:05.364
Get to work!

02:33:06.166 --> 02:33:07.934
[man screaming]

02:33:08.001 --> 02:33:10.603
The whole city's infested.
Spread out.

02:33:13.706 --> 02:33:18.345
[computer] <i>Alert! Justice League
members detected. Breach imminent.</i>

02:33:18.410 --> 02:33:20.446
It's only a matter
of time now, Hank.

02:33:20.512 --> 02:33:21.881
Once they get inside...

02:33:24.149 --> 02:33:26.085
That'll be difficult for them

02:33:26.151 --> 02:33:27.719
once we've achieved orbit.

02:33:40.199 --> 02:33:41.700
[grunting]

02:33:45.137 --> 02:33:46.939
[gasping]

02:33:47.906 --> 02:33:49.674
[beeping]

02:33:50.742 --> 02:33:52.710
We'll be together soon, Terri.

02:34:08.159 --> 02:34:10.228
This is between us, Hank.

02:34:10.295 --> 02:34:12.463
Let her go.

02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:14.531
Once we've left the exosphere,

02:34:14.599 --> 02:34:17.869
you and your gal-pal
will suffocate. Freeze.

02:34:19.404 --> 02:34:23.341
And it's all your fault.

02:34:23.408 --> 02:34:25.676
It's almost poetry.

02:34:25.742 --> 02:34:28.912
- [electricity crackling]
- [Hank screaming]

02:34:45.295 --> 02:34:48.031
[breathing heavily]

02:35:08.484 --> 02:35:09.685
[gasps]

02:35:12.588 --> 02:35:13.923
[straining]

02:35:26.534 --> 02:35:28.670
[groaning]

02:35:45.254 --> 02:35:47.155
[whimpering]

02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:49.624
[gasps]

02:35:57.432 --> 02:35:59.733
[crashing]

02:36:11.112 --> 02:36:13.714
Get away from him,
you son of a bitch!

02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:26.360
[panting]

02:36:26.427 --> 02:36:27.627
Come out, Lois.

02:36:27.694 --> 02:36:28.862
One way or another,

02:36:28.929 --> 02:36:30.797
this is gonna
end badly for you.

02:36:40.475 --> 02:36:41.675
[gasps]

02:37:06.666 --> 02:37:08.368
[panting]

02:37:09.702 --> 02:37:11.137

02:37:13.072 --> 02:37:14.073
[groans]

02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:18.710
[gasps]

02:37:35.862 --> 02:37:37.597
Killing you isn't revenge

02:37:37.662 --> 02:37:40.366
unless your
boyfriend has to watch.

02:37:40.433 --> 02:37:42.235
Open your eyes.

02:37:43.536 --> 02:37:44.736
You're gonna watch this

02:37:44.803 --> 02:37:46.771
if I have to
tear off your eyelids!

02:37:46.838 --> 02:37:48.140
[growling] Open them!

02:37:52.110 --> 02:37:54.045
[whirring]

02:37:57.415 --> 02:37:59.116
[screams]

02:38:10.629 --> 02:38:12.763
You won't kill me

02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:16.434
and I won't stop
until I kill you.

02:38:16.501 --> 02:38:19.770
You're right.
It's not how I'm programmed.

02:38:19.837 --> 02:38:21.138
But you should know

02:38:21.205 --> 02:38:23.774
I've got a wildcard
up my sleeve.

02:38:32.449 --> 02:38:34.017
[growls]

02:38:35.653 --> 02:38:37.421
[screams]

02:38:41.824 --> 02:38:43.027
[gasps]

02:38:44.628 --> 02:38:46.896
[stammering] What?
What is this?

02:38:47.864 --> 02:38:49.766
[Eradicator] <i>Eradication.</i>

02:38:52.168 --> 02:38:53.303
[screams]

02:39:00.709 --> 02:39:02.978
[screaming and
short-circuiting]

02:39:10.453 --> 02:39:12.388
[celestial music playing]

02:39:14.490 --> 02:39:16.226
[moans]

02:39:32.374 --> 02:39:33.508
Clark!

02:39:39.815 --> 02:39:42.951
- Is it over?
- Yes.

02:39:43.018 --> 02:39:44.987
There's still one
more thing I need to do.

02:40:09.777 --> 02:40:11.912
[indistinct chatter]

02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:28.462
[Becky cries]

02:40:31.498 --> 02:40:33.233
[voice shaking] Oh, Eric!

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.502
[whimpering]

02:40:40.374 --> 02:40:42.108
[crying]

02:40:51.318 --> 02:40:53.420
Six months
and 400 miles later,

02:40:53.486 --> 02:40:56.623
a happy return for
one of the <i>Daily Planet's</i> own.

02:40:56.690 --> 02:40:57.890
Clark Kent,

02:40:57.956 --> 02:40:59.459
feared lost
in the Doomsday fight,

02:40:59.526 --> 02:41:00.760
is back home tonight.

02:41:00.826 --> 02:41:02.061
Thanks to the keen eye

02:41:02.127 --> 02:41:03.829
of another Metropolis citizen

02:41:03.896 --> 02:41:05.264
we thought we'd lost.

02:41:05.331 --> 02:41:09.636
I recognized Mr. Kent
from his byline photo

02:41:09.703 --> 02:41:11.338
<i>and brought him home.</i>

02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:16.309
Martian Manhunter
sounds nothing like me.

02:41:16.376 --> 02:41:18.344
[sarcastically]
Oh, everybody says that.

02:41:19.679 --> 02:41:21.180
Hey, I almost forgot.

02:41:21.246 --> 02:41:22.614
Conner's all settled.

02:41:22.682 --> 02:41:26.085
He said, "Thanks for
the sweater, babe."

02:41:26.785 --> 02:41:28.654
Aw!

02:41:28.721 --> 02:41:30.456
They're gonna eat him alive.

02:41:31.256 --> 02:41:33.759
So, where did we leave off?

02:41:33.826 --> 02:41:35.293
[phone buzzing]

02:41:36.462 --> 02:41:37.496
Yeah?

02:41:37.563 --> 02:41:39.098
You're late.

02:41:39.733 --> 02:41:41.767
[sighs] Right.

02:41:41.835 --> 02:41:43.168
Be there in a sec.

02:41:43.235 --> 02:41:45.637
Oh, tell Lois
I'll see her Friday.

02:41:47.539 --> 02:41:48.973
Friday?

02:41:50.074 --> 02:41:51.577
What is it?

02:41:51.643 --> 02:41:53.211
Worlds colliding.

02:41:53.878 --> 02:41:55.380
Also, I have to go.

02:41:56.481 --> 02:41:58.449
It's okay. I understand.

02:42:00.852 --> 02:42:02.220
I'll wait up.

02:45:50.375 --> 02:45:52.110
[Wonder woman]
<i>Henshaw may be gone,</i>

02:45:52.177 --> 02:45:54.144
<i>but this was
still the boldest move</i>

02:45:54.212 --> 02:45:56.715
<i>we've seen
from Apokolips, yet.</i>

02:45:56.781 --> 02:45:59.183
[Batman] Darkseid
won't stay down for long

02:45:59.249 --> 02:46:01.251
and we can't
play defense forever.

02:46:01.318 --> 02:46:02.887
Then we agree.

02:46:02.954 --> 02:46:04.923
We're going to have to take
this fight to his doorstep.

02:46:04.990 --> 02:46:06.458
- [door opens]
- [Lex] Excellent.

02:46:08.893 --> 02:46:10.228
Count me in...

02:46:11.161 --> 02:46:12.330
team.

02:46:14.733 --> 02:46:16.835
Okay, who left
the front door open?
