Mm.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.874
Guys, that is
a packing job
if I ever saw one.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.343
Bravo! I love
that stuff.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.280
What's next, Bobby?
Copyrighting clouds?

00:46.414 --> 00:48.616
I'm sure you'd find
a way to turn a profit

01:24.685 --> 01:26.254
You know, Raymond,
I am not surprised

01:26.387 --> 01:28.289
you didn't anticipate
the raid.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.457
You have been distracted.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.392
Looking for the person responsible

01:31.525 --> 01:33.861
for Elizabeth's death
is hardly a distraction.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.863
No. It's a waste
of time.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.699
Not if I find them.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.502
Even if there was someone,
which I doubt,

01:41.635 --> 01:43.504
finding them will not
bring Elizabeth back.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.973
It only delays you healing,

01:46.106 --> 01:47.441
or, apparently,
house hunting.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.443
Heddie may be
just another cog

01:49.577 --> 01:52.613
in the machine
of my organization,

01:52.746 --> 01:55.549
but she's a fragile
and unpredictable cog,

01:55.683 --> 01:57.718
and she won't last long
behind bars.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.086
You need to get her out.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.588
I'll do my best,
<i>mon capitaine.</i>

02:01.689 --> 02:03.090
Though perhaps you might
have more luck

02:03.224 --> 02:05.092
talking to your
task force pals.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.760
What else are
FBI friends for?

02:06.894 --> 02:08.562
Investigating the Seer.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.831
You mean
on the blacklist?

02:10.964 --> 02:11.799
Yes.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.601
It's brilliant.

02:13.734 --> 02:14.702
Absolutely not.

02:14.835 --> 02:15.969
Come on, Harold.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.571
Hedwig Hawkins
was caught with over

02:17.705 --> 02:20.174
a million dollars' worth
of pirated soybean seeds.

02:20.308 --> 02:24.111
Pirated? Heddie was
just selling seeds
to farmers at a price.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.947
If my associate is guilty
of anything,

02:27.080 --> 02:30.184
it's simply trying to ease
the economic strain

02:30.318 --> 02:32.220
on the hardworking
men and women

02:32.353 --> 02:34.455
who put the tofu
in your turkey,

02:34.588 --> 02:38.526
the cotton in your shirt,
the beans in your coffee.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.528
Everything it means
to be human.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.363
But our immunity agreement
is with you,

02:42.496 --> 02:43.631
not with your employees.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.133
If she talks,
it will be damaging.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.202
How much
is hard to tell,

02:48.336 --> 02:51.305
but it would certainly
have repercussions for me

02:51.439 --> 02:52.540
and for this task force.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.041
We have a deal with you.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.277
The rest of the Justice
Department doesn't.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.846
I can't just pick up the phone
and get her out of custody.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.982
I can only hope that
reciprocal generosity

03:02.115 --> 03:06.153
is a concept that one day
will have meaning for you.

03:06.287 --> 03:10.491
Until that day,
have you ever heard
of Arcane Wireless?

03:10.624 --> 03:11.659
Sounds like
a phone company.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.228
With a black-market
operating system

03:14.362 --> 03:18.699
that cannot be tapped
or traced by law enforcement.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.834
A couple of thousand
beta phones

03:20.968 --> 03:22.370
have been sold to date,

03:22.503 --> 03:25.739
but word is the company
is about to go wide.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.040
That's cause for alarm.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.943
One of the FBI's
most powerful tools,

03:30.077 --> 03:33.547
other than me,
is the federal
wiretap warrant.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.749
Last year,
those warrants resulted

03:35.883 --> 03:38.252
in nearly
7,000 arrests.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.053
Imagine all
of those criminals,

03:40.187 --> 03:44.024
all of that evidence,
well outside of your reach.

03:44.157 --> 03:48.529
That's what will happen
if you don't stop
Arcane Wireless.

03:48.662 --> 03:52.199
Juan Miguel Rojas,
enforcer for the
Castillo Cartel.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.902
This image was captured
from a bank in El Paso

03:55.035 --> 03:57.705
minutes after
he murdered an
informer's family.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.641
Richard Slade,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.543
military-grade
weapons trafficker.

04:02.676 --> 04:06.246
Clients range
from Boogaloo Boys
to the Taliban.

04:06.380 --> 04:10.518
And Clyde MacFarlane
leads the Mount Porte
Motorcycle Club.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.885
Though they started out

04:12.019 --> 04:13.854
and are still based
in West Virginia,

04:13.987 --> 04:17.024
they now handle
a large portion of the
methamphetamine trade

04:17.157 --> 04:19.827
from the Great Lakes
all the way down
to the Gulf Coast.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.895
Yeah, but it's nothing
new that criminals
use cellphones.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.597
Arcane Wireless
isn't a public company.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.799
It's underground,
invite-only,

04:25.933 --> 04:28.068
and those invites
go to the worst of the worst.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.804
The service is like
an electronic cone
of silence.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.105
It's working.

04:32.239 --> 04:33.707
Arcane's clients
have been avoiding arrest

04:33.841 --> 04:35.509
ever since they started
using the phones.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.911
And Reddington says
these phones are about
to flood the market?

04:38.045 --> 04:39.913
He does. Which means
we're on a clock.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.315
And all we have
to go on

04:41.449 --> 04:42.950
is the moniker
of the man in charge.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.752
<i>According to Reddington,
he's known as The Seer.</i>

04:50.658 --> 04:51.925
You're the Seer?
Where's your boss?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.362
You want his business?
You play by his rules.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.597
<i>If these
phones are interfering
with active investigations,</i>

04:56.730 --> 04:57.865
<i>maybe the Bureau
has open case files.</i>

04:57.998 --> 04:59.367
<i>I can reach
out to a contact</i>

04:59.500 --> 05:01.268
over at Information
Security who'd know.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.102
Who is it?

05:02.235 --> 05:03.504
FJ Powell.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.373
He, uh... He actually
was my mentor

05:05.506 --> 05:07.107
who taught me
everything I know,

05:07.240 --> 05:08.942
including that
I could never
be as good as him.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.178
This should be fun.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.048
Step through.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.489
Ah! Geez.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.757
You trying to make me
lose what little hearing
I have left?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.495
Can I see
my client now,

05:27.628 --> 05:29.797
or you want to do a full
cavity search, too?

05:33.200 --> 05:34.868
Ah.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.670
Marvin,
thank Christ.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.540
Heddie.
Hi.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.916
Heddie?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.317
Raymond?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.019
<i>First of all,
how are you?</i>

05:52.152 --> 05:53.387
Were you hurt
in the raid?

05:53.521 --> 05:55.656
No, I'm...
I'm fine.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.158
But where'd those
fed bastards
come from anyway?

05:58.291 --> 05:59.793
You let me
worry about that.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.562
Until we sort this out,

06:01.695 --> 06:05.566
you just luxuriate in
your right to remain silent.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.035
Of course.
Anything for you.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.303
So, how long
before I'm sprung?

06:10.438 --> 06:13.674
I need to warn you
that this is bigger
than a few soybeans.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.576
They are planning
on throwing
the whole book at you.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.011
Racketeering, conspiracy,

06:18.145 --> 06:19.947
aiding and abetting
a fugitive, like...

06:20.080 --> 06:22.015
Yeah, but you say that
like it matters.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.818
We have a 52-card deck
of aces up our sleeve.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.587
<i>Right, Ray Ray?</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.055
<i>No. Not this time.</i>

06:28.188 --> 06:29.256
Wait. No?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.758
But I...
I have macaws.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.392
Macaws?

06:32.526 --> 06:35.763
Not to worry.
I've got a very sweet guy
to watch your birds.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.931
For how long?
They can live to be 60,

06:38.065 --> 06:40.634
and Mango needs the ointment
for her beak disease

06:40.768 --> 06:42.269
and Princess
is more demanding

06:42.402 --> 06:44.772
than an opera singer
with allergies
on opening night.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.374
I... I need
to be there for them.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.043
<i>Heddie, just relax.
Take a breath.</i>

06:50.177 --> 06:51.745
Marvin smuggled an earwig

06:51.879 --> 06:53.180
into a federal facility

06:53.313 --> 06:54.882
so that you could
hear my voice

06:55.015 --> 06:57.851
telling you we will
take care of this.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.219
You have nothing

06:59.352 --> 07:00.688
to worry about.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.355
<i>So sit tight
and stay strong.</i>

07:02.890 --> 07:03.991
Okay.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.258
I'm okay.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.244
I trust my associates

07:24.377 --> 07:26.013
treated you respectfully.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.715
In my line of work,
one has to take

07:27.848 --> 07:29.282
certain
security precautions.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.052
What?
That's funny?

07:32.185 --> 07:34.187
What's funny is that
you think blindfolds

07:34.321 --> 07:36.223
and driving
around in circles
equals security.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.826
Your phone.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.466
Ah.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.135
Location services
are off.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.469
You'd think that
would be sufficient,

07:49.603 --> 07:50.971
but people
just can't resist

07:51.104 --> 07:52.606
using their phones
for things like...

07:52.740 --> 07:53.841
Aha!

07:54.708 --> 07:56.877
Jalapeno poppers
on Grubhub.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.445
Thanks to your
late-night cravings,

07:58.579 --> 08:01.048
every 30 seconds,
his phone is sending
out a ping

08:01.181 --> 08:03.316
to see if he's in
a Grubhub service area.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.686
Any law enforcement
officer with cause

08:05.819 --> 08:07.354
can walk right through
that door right now.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.657
Grub what you love.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.801
That's one
liability down.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.036
I can get rid of all
of them and replace
them with phones

08:23.170 --> 08:24.838
that can't be hacked
or tracked.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.173
I want to see them
in action.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.708
I'll schedule
a demonstration.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.042
Bring any expert
you like.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.711
I've never had
an unhappy client.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.946
Minor players,
no doubt.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.683
I do business
on four continents.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.818
You traffic
on four continents.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.121
Women, children.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.990
You're a troubled person
who does terrible things,

08:43.123 --> 08:44.592
and one day,
you'll be caught.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.862
Unless...
You're invisible.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.600
If your product is
as good as you say,

08:53.466 --> 08:54.868
I'll be buying thousands.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.403
Four continents?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.872
Odin, I'm about to give you
the whole damn planet.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.024
What?

09:17.157 --> 09:19.860
Hello. I, um...

09:19.993 --> 09:22.630
I was, uh, going...
Well, the...
Uh, your door...

09:22.763 --> 09:24.197
Still a fumferer.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.199
Uh, what?
I hate fumfering.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.035
Yet you cause
so much of it.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.403
Sir. Agent Powell.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.239
Um, hello, FJ.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.374
You had promise.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.877
Why did you waste it?
I didn't know I had.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.880
The private sector. Tech.
I thought you'd be
in it by now.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.115
Oh. Yeah. Tech.
Uh, I tried that.
Didn't take.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.918
Um, but now I am on
a federal task force

09:45.052 --> 09:46.920
looking into
Arcane Wireless.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.555
Have you heard of it?

09:48.689 --> 09:52.592
Well, if I had, why should
I tell you about it?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.328
Well, actually, because,
uh, after a few conversations

09:55.462 --> 09:58.799
between my boss
and your
boss's-boss's boss,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.068
uh, you've... Uh, you've
been ordered to.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.844
You outrank me,
don't you?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.246
Oh, only if you mean,
you know, hierarchically,

10:13.380 --> 10:17.284
but in any kind of
meta way, you are this,
like, alpha beast,

10:17.417 --> 10:19.086
and I am...

10:20.120 --> 10:22.122
...not.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.492
Law enforcement has run
into a handful of these

10:25.625 --> 10:28.028
over the past year.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.430
Yesterday, highway patrol
in West Virginia

10:30.563 --> 10:33.801
stumbled onto a biker
running drug money.

10:33.934 --> 10:37.604
He had this, fresh off
the factory floor.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.306
It's been bricked.
This network is not connected

10:39.439 --> 10:41.374
to anything
we've ever seen before.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.043
It's totally impenetrable.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.612
Even when we get our
hands on a phone,

10:45.746 --> 10:47.480
they're able to wipe
all the data remotely.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.449
I'm gonna
call this in.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.218
My task force is gonna
want to interview
the, uh, biker.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.086
In the meantime,
do you, uh, mind
if I, uh, stay here

10:53.220 --> 10:54.187
and take
this phone apart?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.290
I'll get back to you
on that.

10:57.424 --> 11:02.429
As soon as I check
with my boss's-boss's boss.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.331
Technically,
it's that boss's boss,

11:04.464 --> 11:06.066
if you want to be
hierarchical about it.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.970
Which, um, I don't,
but if you did,
then that boss's boss.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.241
How was my client
supposed to know

11:14.374 --> 11:18.478
that she was buying
the asexual clones
of a protected legume?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.413
I mean, it's not
like the beans
were stamped

11:20.547 --> 11:22.149
with a copyright logo.

11:22.282 --> 11:26.119
And I happen to know
that seed patents
are hell to prosecute.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.155
First, you got to
prove disclosure,

11:28.288 --> 11:29.923
then you got to test
the specimens,

11:30.057 --> 11:30.824
<i>then define the content.</i>

11:30.958 --> 11:32.492
<i>I mean, who needs it?</i>

11:32.625 --> 11:33.961
<i>I'll tell you
what we can do.</i>

11:34.094 --> 11:36.163
In exchange
for reduced charges,

11:36.296 --> 11:39.232
my client will testify
against the company

11:39.366 --> 11:41.468
that sold her
that spurious product.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.338
Are you done?
<i>Tell him
you can keep going,</i>

11:45.472 --> 11:48.208
all day, all night,
all year, for eternity.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.677
That's it for this
angle, yeah, but I got
plenty of others,

11:50.811 --> 11:52.880
and I'm gonna keep going
until we make a deal.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.882
The state only has
one deal to offer.

11:55.015 --> 11:55.983
Oop. Here it comes.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.751
Immediate release.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.853
A new name, a new life,
a fresh start.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.254
In exchange for?

12:01.388 --> 12:02.923
Everything she knows
about Raymond Reddington

12:03.056 --> 12:04.324
and his activities.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.725
<i>Full cooperation.</i>

12:05.859 --> 12:07.194
<i>We want names,
we want dates,</i>

12:07.327 --> 12:08.361
<i>we want every
possible detail.</i>

12:08.996 --> 12:10.764
Okay. Done.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.532
Done?
Done.

12:12.665 --> 12:13.767
<i>Marvin, really?</i>
You're saying she'll flip
on Reddington?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.102
Of course not.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.073
Look, we can protect you
against your employer.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.274
What we can't
protect you against

12:21.408 --> 12:23.476
is his rather
colorful lawyer.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.545
Mr. Gerard may say
he's representing you,

12:25.678 --> 12:26.780
but we both know
he's here to look out

12:26.914 --> 12:27.915
for his real client.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.883
And that's
the Raymond person?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.285
Who's that again?
I'm...

12:32.419 --> 12:33.787
That's my girl.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.556
20 years, Miss Hawkins. Minimum.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.492
20 years in a federal prison
rubbing elbows with killers.

12:39.626 --> 12:40.928
That's what you're
looking at, minimum.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.029
Is that really how
you want to grow old?

12:42.162 --> 12:45.232
Well, what about
that guy

12:45.365 --> 12:47.334
from the prison film
with Burt Lancaster?

12:47.467 --> 12:48.768
The one with the birds?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.570
Do they let you
keep birds?

12:50.703 --> 12:52.873
Macaws, specifically?
I... I have two.

12:57.710 --> 13:01.148
Okay, so whoever
developed this is a genius.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.584
Not that I'm a genius,
but I found
the log directory,

13:04.717 --> 13:07.220
and it looks like
it recorded
a time stamp

13:07.354 --> 13:09.256
every time a call
was connected,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.458
but what's weird is,
it seems like every
time that happened,

13:11.591 --> 13:15.262
the phone sent
an outgoing data packet
to a server farm.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.464
Do you have
a final destination?

13:17.597 --> 13:19.099
Uh, no.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.234
In other words, you might
have found something,

13:21.368 --> 13:23.003
if we can trace
the server.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.873
And if we can,
if the server
pings us back.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.242
And if it does,
whether it pings us

13:29.376 --> 13:31.444
where the messages
have been sent.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.813
Okay, but, uh, imagine
how great it'll be

13:33.947 --> 13:36.083
if all those ifs
all happen.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.952
I'll start
running a trace.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.192
What's that?
Greylock?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.660
It's a tech company
with security platforms.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.296
No, yeah,
that, uh, I know.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.198
Why are you
looking at it?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.665
That's none
of your business.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.134
No, of course
it's not.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.468
Normally, it... It...
It wouldn't be.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.871
I know that it...

13:58.005 --> 13:59.372
Spit it out
or swallow it,

13:59.506 --> 14:01.942
but for God's sake,
stop fumfering.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.310
It's my company.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.880
Yours?
Yeah. It is.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.315
Or it... It was.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.184
It... It's not now, but...

14:11.818 --> 14:13.220
I created it.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.322
You're the CTO who left.

14:16.756 --> 14:17.958
How do you know that?

14:18.091 --> 14:19.859
Because I'm applying
to be the CTO.

14:19.993 --> 14:20.860
You're applying for my job?

14:20.994 --> 14:23.630
Yes. The job you left.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.298
Before you were vested.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.399
I was vested.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.735
I chose to make
a clean break.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.337
What makes you think
that I wa...

14:33.173 --> 14:34.407
Are they offering you
ownership shares?

14:36.209 --> 14:39.412
Oh, looks like the trace
is a dead end.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.248
Proxies all
the way down.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.251
They haven't offered me
anything yet.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.653
I'm in
the application stage.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.488
But the offer includes
ownership shares.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.390
Shares that I gave up.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.263
We should keep looking
in the directories...

14:56.396 --> 14:58.131
See what other information
we can find.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.702
The Mount Porte
Motorcycle Club, huh?

15:02.835 --> 15:04.704
It looks like you got
pulled over
in West Virginia

15:04.837 --> 15:07.707
driving a truck carrying
$2 million worth
of drug money,

15:07.840 --> 15:09.943
all because of
a broken tail light.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.278
I got nothing to say
about money.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.879
Well, we don't care
about the money.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.547
We're here
about your phone.

15:14.681 --> 15:15.882
Oh, my phone?

15:16.016 --> 15:18.385
What, you brought me
here to offer me
an upgrade?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.789
Clyde MacFarlane.
The president of your club.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.491
The phone he's using...

15:24.624 --> 15:26.059
It's the same model
you had when you
were arrested.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.527
Where did you get it?

15:27.660 --> 15:28.861
I dunno.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.264
Walmart?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.799
Look, we need a name.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.535
Or we put out the word
that you're a snitch

15:35.668 --> 15:36.936
and that the $2 million
wasn't confiscated

15:37.070 --> 15:38.305
after an arrest,

15:38.438 --> 15:41.208
but actually handed over
as part of our arrangement.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.475
We don't have
an arrangement.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.876
We will if you
don't cooperate.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.450
Riggs.
Riggs who?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.919
I don't know
his first name.
He's part of the club.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.654
He ran the whole thing.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.090
Gave us all new phones,
made us toss our old ones.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.325
Where do we
find Riggs?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.127
He's always
in the same place.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.130
Far end of the bar
at Kelly's in
Randolph County.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.203
I'll get you another
one, Riggs.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.772
Thank you, sugar.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.807
That smells good.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.776
I'll have a plate
of what he's having.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.312

was just arrested,

16:27.387 --> 16:28.821
carrying one
of my phones.

16:28.955 --> 16:31.024
So? They're untraceable.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.192
Thought that was
the big sell.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.870

Unfortunately for you,

We're looking for a man
named Riggs.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.294
You and me both.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.396
One minute,
he's ordering his usual,

17:09.529 --> 17:12.765
and the next, he has
taken off without even
saying goodbye.

17:12.899 --> 17:16.069
And now that I see

I know I was right.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.846

17:26.979 --> 17:29.916
She's trying to act tough,

17:30.049 --> 17:32.252
that's gonna win
any Tonys, you know?

17:32.385 --> 17:35.155
Heddie's got a big heart,

17:35.288 --> 17:36.689
but if they
send her upstate

17:36.823 --> 17:38.425
to eat franks and beans
with the tough gals,

17:38.558 --> 17:40.026
it's anyone's guess
how she's gonna react.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.230
Well, in that case,
we got a serious problem,

17:43.363 --> 17:44.897
'cause on my way out,

17:45.031 --> 17:47.134
I got wind that
the U.S. Attorney's office

17:47.267 --> 17:51.037
has petitioned
the court to find
Heddie alternate counsel.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.240
Why? She has you.
Yeah, you also have me.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.841
You pay me,
and they know that.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.645
Despite my protestations otherwise.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.115
They're, uh... They're citing
conflict of interest.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.451
They're cutting in
to talk to her in private,
lean on her.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.052
They lean on her
hard enough,

18:06.186 --> 18:08.355
that woman will fall faster
than a lawn chair.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.557
Heddie might
surprise us.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.825
She does exhibit a certain
can-do attitude.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.262
Raymond, she knows
enough to make it hurt.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.496
If she rolls on you
to that lawyer,

18:16.629 --> 18:19.132
they will whisk her
straight into hiding

18:19.266 --> 18:21.468
in Never Never Land,
and the next time
you see her,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.536
she will be sitting
in a witness box

18:23.670 --> 18:26.539
testifying against you
in a federal court.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.275
Who do we know
in the Eastern District?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.977
Judge Smathers.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.480
Get Heddie's case
transferred to his
docket right away.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.981
Line some pockets.
Get it done.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.585
Who's this?
This is Itzhak.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.388
15 years in
digital analysis
for the Mossad.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.089
He's here for
your demonstration.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.692
I won't be placing
an order without
his sign-off.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.561
I am told that you
make a phone
that is untraceable.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.997
A skeptic. Good.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.237
<i>911,

18:57.370 --> 18:59.372
It's not my emergency
you should worry about.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.308
Do you know what atrocities
we're committing abroad

19:01.441 --> 19:03.510
right now, originating
from this very city?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.378
Bet you don't.
You don't care.
You're asleep.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.513
But I'm about to
wake everyone up.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.914
<i>Sir, can I have your name?</i>

19:08.047 --> 19:10.250
I've planted an IED
in the Metro.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.319
What are you doing?
There are 40 stations
in the District alone.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.153
You won't have
time to find it
before it goes off

19:14.287 --> 19:16.122
with enough force
to take out an entire block

19:16.256 --> 19:18.291
and who knows how many
so-called innocents.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.393
<i>Sir, you sound upset.
Can we send someone
to your location?</i>

19:20.527 --> 19:21.628
<i>Are you there? Sir?</i>
The instant I cried bomb,

19:21.761 --> 19:23.396
she pressed a button
alerting her superior.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.097
<i>Can I have your location
so we can send someone...</i>
As we speak...

19:25.232 --> 19:26.165
<i>...to speak with you?</i>
...they're attempting
to triangulate

19:26.299 --> 19:27.367
my location
using cell towers.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.935
Itzhak, if you
would be so kind

19:29.068 --> 19:30.670
as to set
a 60-minute timer.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.972
If their trace
is successful,
within the hour,

19:33.105 --> 19:35.742
agents will break
down that door
and arrest us all.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.477
None of which
is going to happen,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.612
because I called on
one of my phones.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.981
And if you're wrong?
But I'm not wrong.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.550
Which is why I brought
a deck of cards.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.151
We've got about
an hour to kill.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.854
What's your game...
Hold 'em, hearts, gin?

19:47.987 --> 19:49.589
You just called in
a bomb threat

19:49.722 --> 19:52.058
and you want to play
a game of cards?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.660
I guess that means
I'm playing solitaire.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.797
You stole
the phone.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.199
No, I took it
without permission.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.568
From your mentor.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.403
He stole my job.
I stole his phone.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.737
He didn't
steal your job.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.205
He's applying
for the job you quit.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.840
Okay, do you know
how much Greylock raised

20:07.974 --> 20:09.175
in Series A financing?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.978
$19 million.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.547
Do you know what my share
of that would have been?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.416
$4.75 million.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.251
Which is why you
stole the phone.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.953
Okay, first, no,
it's not his phone.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.523
And second, yes,
that is exactly
why I stole it.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.991
Your mentor wants
the job you left.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.759
That should
be rewarding.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.094
You know what would
be rewarding?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.862
$4.75 million.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.498
There's nobility
in poverty.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.899
We know who
The Seer is.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.101
We got a link
to surveillance
footage of Kelly's.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.069
A dive bar gave you access
to their security cameras?

20:37.203 --> 20:39.639
No, but the Wellness Center
across the street did.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.508
That's why Riggs
wasn't at the bar.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.875
The Seer
got to him first.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.712
Our Seer
is William Meyers, 46.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.214
A fallen software engineer
convicted of bilking

20:48.348 --> 20:51.050
the tech company he founded
out of $2 million.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.251
On his release,
he hooked up

20:52.385 --> 20:53.320
with the Lyon
Crime Syndicate.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.121
I guess he was looking
for cash,

20:55.254 --> 20:57.790
and old Alonso Lyon
wanted his communication
systems updated.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.126
So, someone from
the Lyon Crime Syndicate

21:00.259 --> 21:03.062
took out someone loyal
to the Mount Porte Club.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.297
That's not
gonna end well.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.232
I tried pulling a BOLO.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.435
Seems the Bureau
issued one on Meyers
three years ago.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.637
Turns out he's almost
as elusive as Reddington.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.739
Then it's a good thing
we're working with Raymond.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.273
He's done business
with Lyon.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.542
Maybe he can
broker a meeting.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.444
Call him.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.181
Morning.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.751
Who are you?

21:24.884 --> 21:27.253
My name is Kamina Gilford.
I'm a defense attorney.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.955
Oh, I already
have one of those.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.123
The court has
appointed me
to meet with you

21:31.257 --> 21:33.726
because an allegation
has been made that
you're represented

21:33.860 --> 21:35.762
by Raymond Reddington's
attorney.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.096
The court's intent
is to assure

21:37.229 --> 21:39.699
that any decisions
you make
are your decisions

21:39.832 --> 21:42.535
and not influenced by
a lawyer who also
represents your boss.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.070
A crime boss.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.405
That's a lot of words.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.940
Words have power.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.976
Your words have the power
to save you, Heddie.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.144
You want me to snitch.
Can you honestly tell me

21:52.278 --> 21:55.882
that you want to spend
20 years in prison,
if you're lucky,

21:56.015 --> 21:58.317
to protect a man who
kills without conscience?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.186
The evidence
against you
is airtight,

22:00.319 --> 22:01.921
and I can say
as a trial lawyer

22:02.054 --> 22:04.691
that if I had to defend you
on these facts, I'd lose.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.192
Does Marvin
know you're here?
No.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.795
And if you accept
the state's offer
of Witness Protection,

22:08.928 --> 22:10.630
he won't be advised
this is happening

22:10.763 --> 22:12.965
until you are safely
in protective custody.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.101
Your birds, too.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.970
U.S. Marshals
are standing by
right now.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.141
Let's be clear, Heddie.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.977
This is your one
opportunity not
to die in jail.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.346
The U.S. Attorney
has extended
this offer to you,

22:27.480 --> 22:29.215
and it's only open
for one hour.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.717
You need to decide now.

22:36.423 --> 22:39.025
<i>We're getting
some more information now</i>

22:39.158 --> 22:41.594
<i>on a bomb threat that has
prompted evacuations...</i>

22:41.728 --> 22:44.030
<i>...of several office
buildings downtown.</i>

22:44.163 --> 22:46.332
There's something
inexplicably rewarding

22:46.466 --> 22:48.234
about winning
at solitaire.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.802
You're not
beating anyone

22:49.936 --> 22:52.204
and yet it's really
quite satisfying.

22:52.338 --> 22:54.340
How about you?
Are you satisfied yet?

22:54.474 --> 22:56.175
I'm intrigued.
Only intrigued?

22:56.308 --> 22:58.210
You just witnessed
an incredible demonstration.

22:58.344 --> 22:59.912
It's one thing
to be untraceable.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.415
It's a whole other thing
to be intercepted,

23:02.549 --> 23:04.016
hacked, and decrypted.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.819
Itzhak pioneered hacking
techniques for the Mossad

23:06.953 --> 23:08.187
that would make
your head spin.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.891
I'll be calling
from 771-555-0136.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.427
The operating system on both
phones is chainOS Secure.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.795
What else
do you need?

23:15.928 --> 23:17.430
Serial numbers?
Storage capacity?

23:17.564 --> 23:19.331
You couldn't be closer to it
than you are right now.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.035
You know, I'm always
looking for talent.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.437
I might have
a place for you,

23:25.371 --> 23:26.906
if you can penetrate
this call.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.642
Hmm.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.310
This is unusual.

23:31.444 --> 23:32.879
The encryption?

23:33.012 --> 23:35.181
No. I... I can't even
get that far.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.917
The phone is plugged
directly into my system,

23:38.050 --> 23:39.886
and I can't even register
a call in progress.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.489
I...

23:44.524 --> 23:45.892
I've never seen anything
like this.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.795
Satisfied now?

23:48.928 --> 23:51.130
With my technology
in your pocket,

23:51.263 --> 23:53.132
you'll dominate the global
market in trafficking.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.504
You've made a believer
of me.

23:58.738 --> 23:59.906
I'll buy every phone
you have.

24:00.406 --> 24:02.108
Smart man.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.910
Now no one in
law enforcement
can touch you.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.258
Ah, Alonso.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.060
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.929
It better
be important, Red.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.565
You just pulled me
from my daughter's
dressage competition.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.935
I wanted to know what
$30,000 in horse
lessons bought me.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.703
I'll explain everything presently.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.271
Where's Reddington?

24:32.404 --> 24:35.074
Here's our
other guest now.

24:35.207 --> 24:39.278
Alonso Lyon,
may I introduce you
to Clyde MacFarlane,

24:39.411 --> 24:42.782
President of
the Mount Porte
Motorcycle Club.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.351
You got some nerve
to summon me, I don't
care who you are.

24:46.786 --> 24:47.887
Why the hell am I here?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.856
Oh, I'd like to know
that as well.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.324
You know what I love?
A good documentary.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.197
Would you look at that!

24:58.330 --> 25:01.901
One of your men
being taken
by your men.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.571
Son of a bitch.
You took out Riggs?

25:04.704 --> 25:07.006
Didn't take out anybody.
How do you even
know he's dead?

25:07.139 --> 25:09.475
He got walked out
of his local bar by
a couple of creeps.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.110
His ex-wife's
hysterical

25:11.243 --> 25:12.679
'cause he missed
his son's
first hockey game.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.080
And he's never missed
a single day

25:14.213 --> 25:16.549
dropping by
the clubhouse
in three years.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.685
Except yesterday
and today.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.687
Now, tell me he's not
gonna show up in
a ditch somewhere.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.522
Well, whatever happened
to him didn't happen
on my orders.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.157
Well, I believe
that's The Seer.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.359
The Seer
is in your employ.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.829
The Seer?
Is that the phone guy?

25:31.063 --> 25:33.099
Yeah, he worked
with me, yeah.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.901
And I let him
branch out
on his own

25:35.034 --> 25:36.502
for a nice piece
of the action.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.738
Providing
a valuable service...

25:38.871 --> 25:40.406
Apparently
to both of you.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.208
The question is,

25:42.341 --> 25:44.010
is it valuable enough
to turn the other cheek?

25:45.244 --> 25:47.279
Not to me.
I got nothing
to do with this.

25:47.413 --> 25:51.117
And yet there's your former
tech guru in living color.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.385
Rumor has it
he redesigned
your syndicate's

25:53.519 --> 25:57.824
entire security system, communications, surveillance.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.927
Transported you
into the 21st century.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.795
Why are you doing this,
stirring up trouble?

26:02.929 --> 26:06.032
My goal is the opposite.
Conflict mediation.

26:06.165 --> 26:09.035
Gang wars are bad
for all of our businesses.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.337
Please,
let's sort this out.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.239
There's nothing to sort.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.742
Except which of his
people I kill
to make us even.

26:15.875 --> 26:19.411
An eye for an eye leaves
the whole world blind.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.447
Riggs was a full member.
That means something.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.883
Someone's got to pay.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.885
An understandable sentiment.

26:26.018 --> 26:29.756
From my vantage point,
The Seer caused the problem.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.290
Perhaps he's
the solution?

26:32.725 --> 26:35.094
I am not gonna sign off
on the death of a friend.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.596
I've had to part company
with people myself.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.131
I'm sure we all have.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.467
Peace and prosperity
for all

26:41.600 --> 26:45.137
is sometimes more important
than one particular person.

26:46.572 --> 26:47.774
Alonso?

26:49.909 --> 26:51.277
All right, let me
hear it from him,

26:51.410 --> 26:52.945
and then I'll do
what needs to be done.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.914
You'll just hide him.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.248
I don't want him disappeared.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.984
I want him dead.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.720
When the time comes,
I'll handle the job.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.089
Does that work
for both of you?

27:05.792 --> 27:06.993
All right.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.497
Well, the hardware
told us nothing.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.999
Did you check
his trace?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.433
Why?

27:14.566 --> 27:16.102
For the same reason
you stole the phone.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.403
And don't say
it was out of spite

27:17.536 --> 27:19.138
because he's applying
for your old job.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.307
It was out of spite
because he's applying
for my old job.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.109
It was also
so you could
check on his work,

27:23.242 --> 27:25.511
because deep down,
you know you're every
bit as good as FJ,

27:25.644 --> 27:27.513
if not better, because
you know he might have
missed something

27:27.646 --> 27:29.515
that you might catch.
The trace was a non-starter.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.650
Too many dummy servers
to identify the end location.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.453
So he says.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.388
I will run the trace again,
but it won't lead anywhere.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.489
And while you're at it,
call Nick

27:37.623 --> 27:39.225
and recommend FJ
for the job.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.761
It's the nice thing to do,
and you're a nice guy.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.163
I suppose you think
that is a compliment

27:44.296 --> 27:46.032
and that it is not FJ's
fault that I took

27:46.165 --> 27:47.867
a vow of poverty

27:48.000 --> 27:51.871
and that if anyone else
deserves the job, he does.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.406
That's exactly what
I think, and despite
how you feel,

27:54.540 --> 27:55.674
I know it's what
you think, too.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.043
You're right.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.077
Then you'll make
the call?

27:58.210 --> 27:59.211
Uh, no.
Absolutely not.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.980
You're not right
about how I feel.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.648
In fact, no, you're
absolutely wrong
about that.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.985
What you're right about
is my running the trace.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.720
Checking his work. Look.

28:07.854 --> 28:11.490
Data packets are being sent
directly to an end server.

28:11.623 --> 28:15.161
FJ Powell is the father
of modern forensic infosec.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.662
He could've found this
in his sleep.

28:16.796 --> 28:17.997
Then why didn't he?

28:18.130 --> 28:19.665
That's the thing.
I think he did.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.072
Ah. Ms. Gilford.

28:27.573 --> 28:30.076
I've been waiting
with bated breath.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.745
What tune did
our songbird sing?

28:32.879 --> 28:33.913
A song of silence.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.547
Ah.
Really?

28:35.681 --> 28:38.184
I've never seen
anything like it.
20 years in hell,

28:38.317 --> 28:40.119
and she's willing
to serve them
all for you.

28:40.252 --> 28:43.890
The loyalty you inspire
in your people,
or is it fear?

28:44.023 --> 28:46.092
That's entirely
case dependent.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.694
In Heddie's case,
it's loyalty.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.997
The woman has the heart
of a Basset Hound.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.698
I'm just glad
she passed the test.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.300
And what
if she failed?

28:54.433 --> 28:56.202
You never told me
what the contingency
plan was.

28:56.335 --> 28:59.105
No need for unpleasant
"what ifs" today.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.908
The fact is,
Heddie stands tall.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.709
Thank you for your time,
Ms. Gilford.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.845
Give my regards
to Judge Smathers,

29:05.978 --> 29:08.781
and I hope your
new bungalow
on Sint Maarten

29:08.915 --> 29:11.550
is everything you've
always dreamed of.

29:11.683 --> 29:12.952
Best afternoon's work
I've ever done.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.720
I would agree.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.188
The gentleman
who brought you here

29:16.322 --> 29:18.190
is waiting to take you
wherever you'd like.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.525
Thank you.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.095
Heddie has
a rough road ahead.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.797
I'll make some calls.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.599
See that she gets
the best bunk
in the whole place.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.235
Limitless
commissary account.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.404
That won't be
necessary, Marvin.

29:32.538 --> 29:35.975
I'd say Heddie's
earned her freedom,
wouldn't you?

29:36.108 --> 29:37.944
I mean, I know
you're good,
but the, uh,

29:38.077 --> 29:39.979
woman's in a federal
holding cell.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.414
What, are you planning
on staging a breakout?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.150
In a manner
of speaking, yes.

29:54.961 --> 29:57.463
Hello, Alonso.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.967
You killed a full member
of the Mount Porte
Motorcycle Club?

30:01.100 --> 30:02.601
What were you thinking?

30:02.734 --> 30:05.437
The FBI was on its way
to question him about Arcane.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.673
You should have
come to me.
<i>I don't work for you.</i>

30:07.806 --> 30:10.342
Only because
I allowed you to go.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.944
<i>You operate
under my protection.</i>

30:12.078 --> 30:13.345
<i>Don't forget.</i>

30:13.479 --> 30:16.615
I introduced you to many
of your clients.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.617
Nobody even knew
who you were
two years ago.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.352
I think sharing half
my profits with you

30:20.486 --> 30:21.787
expresses the appropriate

30:21.921 --> 30:23.322
amount of appreciation.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.690
Profits that might
have disappeared

30:24.823 --> 30:25.992
if the FBI
had gotten to Riggs.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.659
<i>You crossed a line,</i>

30:27.793 --> 30:30.562
and I'm staring down a war
with a dangerous enemy.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.032
We need to fix this.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.634
When and where can
we meet to discuss?

30:35.767 --> 30:37.369
I'm on my way to close a deal
with a new client.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.271
Rock Creek Park
in 45 minutes.

30:39.405 --> 30:40.439
<i>We can talk after.</i>

30:40.572 --> 30:41.373
I'll be there.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.810
Make it
as quick as possible.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.379
Don't let him suffer.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.614
He won't feel
a thing.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.296
Cooper.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.065
Harold, I have
a time and place.

31:15.341 --> 31:16.342
What am I missing?

31:18.210 --> 31:19.645
Manners.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.181
You always said
it wasn't enough
to see only the code.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.183
To be great,
you need to see
the big picture.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.852
Well, I cannot see it,
or I don't want to,

31:26.986 --> 31:31.123
because the only big
picture I see is that
you're a traitor.

31:31.257 --> 31:34.860
A convenient accusation,
as even uttering it

31:34.994 --> 31:37.729
might prevent me
from getting
your old job.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.165
That has nothing
to do with this.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.200
But you don't want
me to get it, do you?

31:41.333 --> 31:42.768
What I want is for
you to tell me,

31:42.901 --> 31:44.636
why didn't you run
the trace?

31:44.770 --> 31:48.140
Is that what you want,
or is that an order?

31:48.274 --> 31:49.241
Both. And if you don't
believe me,

31:49.375 --> 31:50.309
why don't you
call the boss?

31:50.442 --> 31:51.710
I don't need
to call the boss.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.679
I know exactly
what she would say.

31:53.812 --> 31:56.015
So do I. That I should
arrest you.

31:56.148 --> 31:59.385
Actually, she would curse
your infernal meddling

31:59.518 --> 32:02.088
and then grant me permission
to read you into the situation

32:02.221 --> 32:05.924
hoping to prevent you
from causing
any lasting damage.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.795
The only thing
I'm trying to damage
is the Arcane network.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.631
And by doing that,
you damage the country.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.101
You think I'm a traitor.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.635
But if you saw
the big picture,

32:17.603 --> 32:20.339
you'd see that
I'm a patriot.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.641
Yes, I've been protecting
the Arcane Network.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.211
Because...

32:25.844 --> 32:26.878
I created it.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.989
We got eyes
on the target.
Perimeter secure.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.225
Stand by.
Let's see who
he's meeting first.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.004
Who's the unsub?

32:52.138 --> 32:53.739
Odin Interdonato.

32:53.872 --> 32:55.574
Head of a human
trafficking operation.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.743
The largest trafficking
operation in the country.

32:57.876 --> 33:00.446
He's destroyed literally
thousands of lives
and families.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.947
And if he starts using
The Seer's phone,

33:02.081 --> 33:04.550
his operation
goes invisible.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.552
If we move in now,
we can take them both down.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.054
You're all clear.
Do it.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.455
Go.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.866
Sir! Sir, you have
to shut it down!

33:20.999 --> 33:22.568
It's the FBI!
What's the FBI?

33:22.701 --> 33:25.271
The Seer,
Arcane Wireless.
It's all an op.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.005
The Seer,
he's a deep
cover agent.

33:27.139 --> 33:28.674
He's one of us.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.542
Agent Ressler,
Agent Zuma,
pull back.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.244
<i>Negative.
Target is engaging.</i>

33:35.547 --> 33:37.015
Hands!
Don't move!

33:38.650 --> 33:40.386
You have no idea
what you just did.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.020
You know what?
Save it for
the judge.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.723
We had one chance. One.
And you ruined it.

33:46.258 --> 33:47.826
<i>Don't even
think about it!</i>

33:47.959 --> 33:49.061
<i>Moving out!</i>

33:49.195 --> 33:50.062
<i>Right there, right there.</i>

33:54.500 --> 33:56.168
Interdonato is dead.

34:03.975 --> 34:06.645
You had no authority
to move in on my operation.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.847
You were making a deal
with a human trafficker.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.717
You think I was making
a deal? Give me
one of my phones.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.720
See if I can spell
this out for the
nosebleed seats.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.556
Criminals make a call.
Totally encrypted.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.258
Not identifiable
by any traditional method

34:19.391 --> 34:20.792
of forensic wiretapping.

34:20.926 --> 34:23.061
It was keeping
arrests down.
For now.

34:23.195 --> 34:26.198
Short-term concession
for long-term gain.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.599
What our clients
didn't know

34:27.733 --> 34:28.700
is that every one

34:28.834 --> 34:30.602
of their conversations
was recorded

34:30.736 --> 34:32.738
and sent back
to our server farm.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.740
I wasn't aiding
Odin Interdonato.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.708
I was bugging him.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.211
I convinced him to use
our phones, exclusively,

34:39.345 --> 34:40.846
to run his operations.

34:40.979 --> 34:43.549
Thousands of criminals,
all around the world.

34:43.682 --> 34:44.550
Do you know
how much work
went into this?

34:45.984 --> 34:47.753
Millions of dollars
in R&D.

34:47.886 --> 34:50.489
I spent years developing
my criminal bonafides,

34:50.622 --> 34:53.392
and you rush in like
John Wayne's Cavalry

34:53.525 --> 34:55.461
after two days of recon
and shoot up the place.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.928
What about Riggs?

34:57.062 --> 34:58.564
You killed him
to protect your cover.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.466
Killed? No.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.268
FJ heard you were nosing
around Mount Porte,

35:02.401 --> 35:03.969
so I arrested Riggs
before he could get to him.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.704
He's in a safe house
in Cleveland.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.105
We were done
with them anyway...

35:07.239 --> 35:08.640
We'd gotten the intel
on their big shipment,

35:08.774 --> 35:10.542
so we busted out
the lights on their truck

35:10.676 --> 35:12.444
to give Highway Patrol
a reason to pull him over.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.146
DEA was taking it over
from there.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.882
Why didn't someone
in the Bureau notify
us to stand down?

35:17.015 --> 35:18.450
We would have, if FJ
could have determined

35:18.584 --> 35:20.486
who Agent Mojtabai
worked for.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.421
But apparently, that's an
incredibly well-kept secret.

35:31.096 --> 35:32.431
I am sorry.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.166
For what?

35:35.301 --> 35:36.502
Saying you're sorry
is meaningless

35:36.635 --> 35:38.604
unless you say
what you're sorry for.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.573
It's a pretty long list.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.675
I'm sorry
for messing up the op.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.110
The phones you created,

35:45.244 --> 35:46.478
they are incredible.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.180
I honestly don't know

35:48.314 --> 35:49.315
how you did it.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.583
They could have been used
for so much good.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.220
I'm, uh, sorry
that we messed that up.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.189
You should be sorry
about that.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.527
Anything else?

36:01.660 --> 36:02.894
Sorry I thought
you were a traitor?

36:03.028 --> 36:04.830
Yeah,
that's two things.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.633
What else?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.135
Resenting you for wanting

36:10.269 --> 36:11.002
to take my old job.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.773
And?
And?

36:14.906 --> 36:17.443
There's more?
I don't know.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.777
Um, my very existence?

36:20.846 --> 36:22.814
You don't owe me
another apology.

36:22.948 --> 36:26.051
But you do owe one
to yourself.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.588
You are a smart
young man with
a bright future.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.757
What I created at
the Arcane Network

36:31.890 --> 36:37.028
is no more impressive
than what you created
at Greylock.

36:37.162 --> 36:38.730
I've been asked to join
dozens of start-ups,

36:38.864 --> 36:40.899
each more pedestrian
than the next,

36:41.032 --> 36:46.705
but what you
created here, it's...
It's inspired.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.574
Which makes me
think that what
you're doing here

36:48.707 --> 36:51.377
is also inspired,

36:51.510 --> 36:53.812
or you wouldn't be here
and not there.

36:53.945 --> 36:56.415
So...

36:56.548 --> 36:59.351
Forgive yourself
for the choices
that you've made.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.121
As far as I can tell,
my friend...

37:05.391 --> 37:06.692
They're the right ones.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.862
<i>I'm telling you,
the sky was the limit.</i>

37:10.996 --> 37:12.531
Odin was
our latest prize,

37:12.664 --> 37:14.833
but we had our eyes
fixed on an even
bigger fish.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.702
Number one on
the Most Wanted List.

37:18.203 --> 37:19.571
Raymond Reddington.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.408
You were targeting him.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.776
We slipped a few
of our phones
into his ranks.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.912
Taking him down was one
of the main priorities

37:27.045 --> 37:28.547
of the wide release.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.549
Now we will never
know what we could've
accomplished.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.823
<i>This was all
about protecting you
and your organization!</i>

37:37.956 --> 37:39.425
I guess you've spoken
with The Seer.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.092
Yeah, and it became
abundantly clear

37:41.226 --> 37:43.228
that this was about
saving your ass.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.931
We're each looking out
for our own interests,

37:46.064 --> 37:48.867
operating according
to our own principles.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.136
When those interests align,
so be it.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.438
Today, they didn't.

37:52.571 --> 37:53.739
That task force
was conducting

37:53.872 --> 37:55.741
a years-long
surveillance operation.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.643
<i>And look how well
it worked out.</i>

37:57.776 --> 38:01.847
Odin Interdonato is dead,
and ongoing intel gathered

38:01.980 --> 38:05.584
by whatever is left
of the Arcane Network

38:05.717 --> 38:07.986
<i>will lead to the arrests
of Alonso Lyon</i>

38:08.119 --> 38:10.689
and Clyde MacFarlane
and who knows how many more?

38:10.822 --> 38:13.258
A convenient vacuum
I'm sure you will have
no trouble filling.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.460
<i>Not interested.</i>

38:14.593 --> 38:15.761
I've got other fish
to fry.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.100
Hey!

38:22.233 --> 38:24.603
I do not appreciate you
making an end-run

38:24.736 --> 38:26.004
around my representation.

38:28.574 --> 38:29.775
Excuse us.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.780
People have the right
to an attorney,
not a mouthpiece.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.682
I tried to get
her one.
Oh, yeah.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.351
An attorney who will
get Heddie to do what
you want her to do.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.520
It doesn't really
matter, does it,
Mr. Gerard?

38:41.653 --> 38:43.589
Reddington got his way,
thanks to you.

38:43.722 --> 38:44.790
You're a disgrace
to your profession.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.925
Am I? And how do
you figure that?

38:47.058 --> 38:48.193
In case you
haven't heard,
Miss Hawkins chose

38:48.326 --> 38:49.327
to turn down
the deal.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.762
For the next 20 years,

38:50.896 --> 38:52.197
every time you see
your boss's face,

38:52.330 --> 38:53.932
I hope you think about
that misguided,

38:54.065 --> 38:56.435
manipulated woman
rotting in prison.

38:56.568 --> 39:01.707
Yeah, uh, no, that is, uh...
That is not gonna happen.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.874
What, you're not gonna
think of her?

39:03.008 --> 39:04.410
No, she's not
going to prison.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.715
What do you know
about the Arcane

39:09.848 --> 39:11.216
Wireless Network?

39:11.850 --> 39:13.184
Nothing?

39:13.318 --> 39:15.153
Well, tell your superiors
all it will take

39:15.286 --> 39:17.389
are a few
well-placed phone calls

39:17.523 --> 39:19.024
to spread the word

39:19.157 --> 39:21.893
to every drug runner,
gangster, and con man

39:22.027 --> 39:24.229
who are still in possession
of an Arcane phone

39:24.930 --> 39:26.965
that they are bugged

39:27.098 --> 39:28.366
by the very same people

39:28.500 --> 39:29.635
that they are supposed

39:29.768 --> 39:31.937
to be kept invisible to.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.739
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.574
But I do know this
is not a negotiation.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.842
No, no, no.
It isn't.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.610
Not between the two
of us, anyway.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.345
But the next time
you hear about this,

39:40.479 --> 39:43.749
it'll come
from someone high up.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.984
And when that
happens, let me
tell you something...

39:46.117 --> 39:48.654
The only way that you are
going to stop a mountain

39:48.787 --> 39:50.822
of failed hopes
and dreams

39:50.956 --> 39:53.825
from coming tumbling
down on you

39:53.959 --> 39:55.861
is gonna be when
you set my client free.

39:57.362 --> 39:58.764
Got that?

40:04.269 --> 40:05.871
Hey, uh, Chloe.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.608
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.910
$19 million.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.445
Yeah, no, that's great.
That's great news.

40:15.380 --> 40:18.550
Come to the celebration?
No. Uh, I don't know.

40:18.684 --> 40:19.885
Um...

40:20.385 --> 40:22.521
In Tahiti.

40:22.654 --> 40:23.955
On a private jet. Oh.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.725
No, I'm... I'm good.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.727
Yeah, no, I'm...
I'm positive.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.597
Listen, um, is, uh...
Is Nick still around?

40:32.598 --> 40:34.933
No. No, that's okay.
Just, um...

40:37.603 --> 40:39.304
Just tell him I sent
over a resume, uh,

40:39.437 --> 40:40.939
for someone
to take my old job.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.810
Yeah, he's gonna want to
hire this guy.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.179
He's awesome.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.217
My hero!

40:52.350 --> 40:53.719
Heddie.
Come in, my dear.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.221
Oh, thank you.

40:56.354 --> 40:58.223
Oh, no, thank you.
Oh!

40:58.356 --> 40:59.625
Please, have a seat.

40:59.758 --> 41:00.792
Thank you
for getting me out.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.093
I...

41:03.394 --> 41:05.196
I am so sorry.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.165
It was the phones,
Heddie, not you.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.634
Oh.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.101
So, how do you know

41:10.235 --> 41:11.469
that they won't be
a problem going forward?

41:11.603 --> 41:13.171
It's been taken care of.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.274
You should know that I was
approached by a lawyer.

41:16.407 --> 41:18.309
The bloodsucker wanted me
to turn on you.

41:18.443 --> 41:19.745
Yes, I know.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.913
Ms. Gilford
is my bloodsucker,

41:22.047 --> 41:24.683
along with the judge
who assigned her
to your case.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.953
So, wait, you sent
her in to see if
I was loyal to you?

41:28.086 --> 41:29.287
Kind of like a test?

41:29.420 --> 41:31.957
A pass or die test?

41:32.591 --> 41:33.859
I'm sorry, Heddie.

41:33.992 --> 41:37.295
Tests have always
made my nerves wacky.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.630
They're the reason
I dropped out
of high school.

41:38.764 --> 41:40.732
I barely passed the GEDs.

41:40.866 --> 41:43.168
Oh, and the CPA... I spent
more time in the bathroom

41:43.301 --> 41:45.503
than I did
on the worksheets.

41:45.637 --> 41:48.073
If I had known
that you were
giving me a test,

41:48.206 --> 41:51.176
I... I probably would have
flunked, but instead...

41:51.309 --> 41:53.612
You passed
with flying colors.

41:53.745 --> 41:57.015
I'd offer you an alcoholic
beverage to celebrate,

41:57.148 --> 41:59.484
but I seem to recall
you have a taste for...

41:59.618 --> 42:01.620
Yerba mate.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.955
I didn't show you
the ritual when you
were last here, did I?

42:04.089 --> 42:05.056
No.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.992
It's one meant to be
shared with friends.

42:08.660 --> 42:09.995
A gourd.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.330
The leaves.

42:12.463 --> 42:14.700
