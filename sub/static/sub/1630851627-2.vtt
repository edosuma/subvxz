[devices whirring]

00:36.077 --> 00:38.580
-[Niko] Comms check?
-We hear you, loud and clear.

00:38.663 --> 00:39.748
Copy that.

00:40.498 --> 00:41.583
[William] Keep your suit on.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.753
My readings indicate
that the atmosphere's unbreathable.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.963
No objections from me.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.766
[whooshing]

01:02.395 --> 01:03.396
There's nothing.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.191
-[instruments bleeping]
-Nothing?

01:06.691 --> 01:07.984
There's no signs of life?

01:10.111 --> 01:13.114
All I'm seeing
are the occasional energy bursts.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.117
Otherwise, it's empty.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.955
Completely empty.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.839
Doesn't make any sense.

01:31.132 --> 01:35.261
It's not like
this is some vacant satellite station.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.348
They have to be here somewhere.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.893
My scans are pickin' up
an energy signature.

01:42.727 --> 01:43.895
It's to your left.

-Are you seeing this?

01:59.369 --> 02:00.370
What is it?

02:02.413 --> 02:03.665
[Niko] It's incredible.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.961
Uh… It's a light. It--

02:09.879 --> 02:11.673
It's big. I-It's…

02:13.967 --> 02:15.677
forming something enormous.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.973
It could be billions of nanomachines
working together.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.267
Or maybe they are the Achaia,

02:23.143 --> 02:25.687
a hybrid of energy and machine.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.648
It's like the ring is alive.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.527
It's inviting me in.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.046
[low rumbling]

[energy whooshing]

03:06.728 --> 03:08.396
Salvare, do you copy?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.231
[Cas] We copy.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.069
[Niko] I'm about half--

03:15.153 --> 03:16.696
[bleeping]

03:17.655 --> 03:18.781
-William.
-Uh--

03:18.865 --> 03:22.535
I can't tell whether Niko's comms
and vitals are being blocked…

03:22.619 --> 03:23.453
Can you unblock them?

03:23.536 --> 03:26.789
Not with the Achaian technology
that's doing the blocking, no.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.336
We always knew this could happen,
we could lose contact.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.587
Are we sending someone over?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.131
-Not yet.
-It's a negotiation.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.592
So, let Niko negotiate.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.471
Build up some goodwill. If we interfere,
they could take that as aggression.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.765
So blocking us, that wasn't aggressive?

03:43.848 --> 03:46.684
How do we know they're not putting
an implant in her head?

03:46.768 --> 03:49.145
Why would they do that?
What would be the point?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.981
Turn the commander of the Salvare
into a planet-killing brain slave?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.692
-She would never let that happen.
-Like I had a choice.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.905
-You were unconscious.
-Plus, if it did happen,

03:58.988 --> 04:01.241
I'd know the second
Niko stepped back onto the Salvare.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.660
-You didn't with Sasha--
-I scanned him myself, Bernie.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.620
-He still outsmarted us.
-Everybody, stop.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.998
Let's try not to jump to conclusions.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.546
William,
keep running all the scans you can.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.424
-Let me know the moment anything changes.
-Absolutely.

04:18.508 --> 04:22.345
Everybody else, if the Achaia wanna
fortify their ship against us,

04:23.137 --> 04:24.806
we'll fortify our ship against them.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.224
Meaning Iara?

04:26.307 --> 04:27.475
She's part Achaian.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.311
[William] She could be susceptible
to Achaian interference.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.605
If anything,
we should strengthen her containment.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.773
So far, so good with this.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.152
Still, I want you
to run a full diagnostic.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.571
Make sure her firewalls are rock solid.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.031
Will do.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.997
-I'm going out there.
-No. You can't. It's too dangerous.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.374
I have to finish
the work August and Oliver started.

04:51.958 --> 04:52.834
Wait.

04:54.752 --> 04:55.628
[Zayn sighs]

04:56.212 --> 04:58.798
Javier and Iara
shouldn't be left alone together.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.552
Our best efforts to control her and him
might not be enough.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.929
We could wake up a new engineer.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.557
We will. When Niko gets back.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.017
[William] Cas.

05:10.393 --> 05:15.023
For what it's worth, I'd say the fact
Niko survived entry into the ring, I--

05:15.815 --> 05:17.358
I'd take that as a good sign.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.986
For what it's worth, I don't.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.410
[typing]

05:29.037 --> 05:31.039
[bleeping and whirring]

05:33.374 --> 05:35.293
Have you ever been to the ocean?

05:36.419 --> 05:37.253
Which one?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.088
[sighs] Earth has five.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.381
[chuckles]

05:41.507 --> 05:45.553
I've read that the ocean induces
a meditative state in humans.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.597
The color blue is soothing,

05:47.680 --> 05:49.682
the ebb and flow destimulates the brain

05:49.766 --> 05:52.352
-and changes its frequency--
-Silence ain't bad either.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.437
[continues typing]

05:57.231 --> 06:00.777
I could turn this room into
the approximation of a coastal resort.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.403
Is there a point to all this?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.323
You just lost three people close to you.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.827
You're upset. It… could help soothe you.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.038
That is not gonna help.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.708
I didn't kill them, Javier.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.378
-No. Your friends did.
-They're not my friends.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.088
I'm as human as I am Achaian.

06:20.171 --> 06:24.467
Exactly! Exactly. You're Achaian.
You're a threat to this ship.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.968
And you're not?

06:26.052 --> 06:29.889
That piece of Achaian tech sitting
inside your head, keeping you alive,

06:29.972 --> 06:32.517
-that's not dangerous?
-We are not the same.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.726
Oh. [chuckles]

06:33.810 --> 06:34.644
That's right.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.939
Only one of us is blocked
behind a firewall.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.577
It's not all that.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.371
The ocean.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.623
So you have been.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.917
Once.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.293
[laughs] Yeah.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.548
All those tourists
and garbage on the beach.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.008
No. Not fun. Not relaxing.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.804
But thanks for thinking of me.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.556
And them.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.182
I am sorry.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.645
Javier.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.357
You're not free either.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.444
Not really.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.497
[laser humming]

07:37.165 --> 07:37.999
Anything?

07:38.666 --> 07:42.336
Nope. Lasers won't burn through it.
Sonic waves have no effect.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.548
Same goes for high-pressure water streams
and chisels.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.883
Hmm.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.844
What about a, uh, plasma knife?

07:49.927 --> 07:51.053
Uh…

07:51.137 --> 07:54.223
Look, if your plan was
to blast your way in and rescue Niko,

07:54.307 --> 07:55.141
good luck.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.727
Like, this shit is indestructible.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.687
Who said we're rescuing Niko?

08:01.230 --> 08:02.064
I just assumed--

08:02.148 --> 08:03.858
We don't know
what's happening in that ring.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.778
Until we do, no blasting required.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.198
Gotcha.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.910
Have you, uh… told Cas that?

08:14.994 --> 08:16.370
So it's not just me.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.373
She's very emotionally attached to Niko.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.668
They're battle buddies.
They've been in the trenches.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.463
Sure. But if this thing goes sideways,

08:26.339 --> 08:29.300
Cas is going to need
to make some difficult choices fast.

08:31.969 --> 08:32.970
[sighs]

08:33.054 --> 08:35.473
Keep at it. Try the plasma knife.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.183
Uh, can't hurt.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.401

End this simulation,

right now.

10:59.533 --> 11:00.618
Can we go home?

11:03.162 --> 11:04.413
You're in my head.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.626
They conjured you from my memories.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.877
It's me, Mom.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.180
Jana. Is it really you?

11:22.139 --> 11:23.057
Did I die?

11:24.892 --> 11:25.851
Are we dead?

11:27.311 --> 11:28.729
Why would you say that?

11:29.730 --> 11:30.773
I was sick.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.069
I couldn't move. I was really tired.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.364
That was after Dad met the aliens.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.954
Jana? What is it?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.124
Dad's waiting for me.

Where?

Outside.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.047
I don't wanna leave you.

Go.

Good work, Cas.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.737
Thank August and Oliver. Not me.

14:27.741 --> 14:30.244
-We can't just wait here indefinitely.
-Agreed.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.830
William, an update, please.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.167
Nothing from the Achaian vessel.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.419
Yeah. I assumed.

14:39.003 --> 14:42.256
I'm tired of waiting on word
that Niko's alive. I've made a decision.

14:42.339 --> 14:44.717
-I'm sending in Iara.
-Iara's half Achaian.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.345
Which makes her alone uniquely capable
of finding Niko and bringing her back.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.223
-Exactly. Do you wanna tell her?
-Whoa. Hold on that.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.643
For all we know, she set a trap
sending Niko in the first place.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.938
This could all be some elaborate plan
for Iara to escape.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.524
But Iara's coding is stored
within the Salvare's--

15:00.608 --> 15:03.360
Even if she wanted to cut and run,
it's not possible.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.031
Iara's just as much a part of the Salvare
as William is.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.658
We've got this incredible resource,

15:09.742 --> 15:12.202
and instead of using Iara,
we've locked her behind a firewall.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.706
-Because she's a threat to this ship.
-Everything is a threat to this ship.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.459
We learned that when they fired on us
and killed two crew.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.341
We need your help.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.262
Please, love. Have some tea.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.475
I don't drink tea.

15:35.935 --> 15:36.936
I drink coffee.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.313
Coffee.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.608
Strong, like my daughter.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.029
[laughs]

15:48.489 --> 15:51.492
Oh, honey, honey, honey.
None of this is real.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.912
We're at that silly silent retreat
you took with Erik.

15:55.537 --> 16:00.250
This carafe is some wedding gift
you insisted on keeping,

16:00.751 --> 16:02.878
and me, I'm here.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.508
You hijacked my brain?

16:07.591 --> 16:08.842
You chose the interface.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.930
I'm a manifestation
offered from your memories.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.974
Presented by the hippocampus.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.934
Thoughts given form.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.353
But why you-- Uh--

16:20.396 --> 16:21.313
Why her?

16:22.523 --> 16:25.609
Maybe you see the real me
as some kind of pushover.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.820
Definitely not that.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.907
And Jana, that wasn't real.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.039
Tell me that wasn't real.

16:39.707 --> 16:44.044
No mother should ever see their daughter
like that, as if leaving her,

16:44.545 --> 16:46.755
being away from your baby
wasn't hard enough.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.091
Then why show me that at all?

16:49.633 --> 16:52.094
We wanted you to see
what we're capable of.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.140
-Jana was sick. Erik brought her to us--
-Sick with what?

16:56.223 --> 16:59.393
We intervened. We saved her life, Niko.

17:00.144 --> 17:00.978
No.

17:02.187 --> 17:06.108
We can take you,
your entire crew back to Earth.

17:06.608 --> 17:10.029
Back home,
back to your family where you belong.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.032
And in return?

17:13.532 --> 17:14.908
Oh!

17:14.992 --> 17:18.120
Straight to the point.
That you get from your father.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.707
I came here to negotiate,
not work on my mommy issues.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.128
So let's get to it.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.508
Let's negotiate.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.595
In exchange,

17:35.387 --> 17:37.556
we need you to spread a message for us.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.349
Which is?

17:40.350 --> 17:42.311
The Achaia come in peace.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.443
You and I have
two very different definitions of peace,

17:50.903 --> 17:51.820
Mother.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.698
Iara, we're ready.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.409
You're sure they won't detect you
once you're on board?

17:57.493 --> 17:59.912
Stop worrying. I'm made of the same code.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.623
-Half of the same code.
-Which is more than enough.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.250
They're not gonna know I'm there.
Trust me.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.295
Ready.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.467
[buzzing]

18:19.807 --> 18:21.809
[loud rushing hum]

18:42.329 --> 18:44.331
[humming]

18:54.299 --> 18:58.220
It's an influx of activity on our servers.
We're being flooded with data.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.680
They're hacking our systems.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.932
We need to shut this down.
Sever Iara's connection.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.725
No, no, no. It's not the Achaia. It's us.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.395
It's Achaian data coming from Iara.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.063
Iara's hacking the Achaian ring?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.858
Looks like it. I'm rerouting
all the data to a secure server now.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.652
Forget the data, Iara.
Focus on finding Niko.

19:13.735 --> 19:17.739
She's already inside.
Why not gather as much intel as we can?

19:18.657 --> 19:19.491
Are they reading her?

19:20.242 --> 19:23.078
Uh, I'm not-- I'm not pickin' up
any changes in activity.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.038
Look, you were right.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.584
Iara's an incredible resource,
and we were wasting her.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.919
So let's stop doing things half-assed.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.464
Intelligence is our best defense
against the Achaia.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.469
Iara, get what you can.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.971
But Niko is your main priority.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.390
Do not stay in there
any longer than you need to.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.391
[Iara] Understood.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.106
[gasps]

19:52.482 --> 19:54.943
Everything is black and white.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.236
Right and wrong.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.156
Another bad habit
you picked up from your father.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.742
-You slaughtered an entire species.
-That wasn't us.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.243
They had implants.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.787
The same shit
you forced into Sasha's head.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.666
And the bodies, there were fields of them.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.586
The entire planet was a graveyard.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.464
Casualties of a war they started.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.798
And you ended

20:17.591 --> 20:19.343
by destroying their planet.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.553
Is that what you do?

20:22.930 --> 20:24.681
To species that resist you?

20:24.765 --> 20:25.807
Wrong.

20:26.725 --> 20:29.019
The Zakir were offered the same deal.

20:29.561 --> 20:33.315
Environmental rejuvenation,
unlimited prosperity.

20:34.483 --> 20:38.654
But the rich,
the establishment, they resisted.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.323
"There must be a catch."

20:41.406 --> 20:44.576
Meanwhile, the rest of Zakir
were begging us for help.

20:45.285 --> 20:49.873
Factions grew. Civil war broke out.
That's the carnage you saw.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.250
And now they're dust

20:52.000 --> 20:52.918
because of you.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.336
No!

20:56.046 --> 20:57.422
Because of you.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.633
Because you interfered.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.886
You blew up our Artifact,

21:02.970 --> 21:05.514
killing thousands of Achaia
in the process.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.893
So we retaliated against you.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.480
-I was protecting them.
-No.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.690
I was helping them.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.818
[loud whir]

21:20.946 --> 21:22.489
Who's this little bird?

21:24.324 --> 21:26.118
Cas sent me to find you.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.869
You shouldn't be here, Iara.

21:28.578 --> 21:29.413
[mother] Iara?

21:34.459 --> 21:37.462
Oh, I think this is exactly
where you should be.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.926
-[resonating hum]
-[gasps]

21:43.427 --> 21:44.469
How did you--

21:45.429 --> 21:46.847
I can feel you.

21:47.848 --> 21:48.807
That's…

21:49.683 --> 21:51.059
that's impossible.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.145
Here with us, you are connected.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.731
[gasps]

21:56.481 --> 21:57.941
You're so beautiful.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.027
So pretty on the outside.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.488
Inside,

22:04.281 --> 22:07.743
you're a mongrel, a literal mutt,

22:08.452 --> 22:10.996
letting these humans keep you locked up,

22:11.621 --> 22:13.540
desperate for their approval.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.584
You'd do anything.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.919
You'd steal from us.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.922
I-- I didn't mean to.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.090
Leave her alone, Ava.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.427
-This is between you and me. Not her.
-Oh! [laughs]

22:25.510 --> 22:26.720
Oh, my goodness.

22:27.262 --> 22:32.434
Your whole life you've just always wanted
to protect things, save people.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.146
Like that little bird in our backyard.
Remember?

22:36.772 --> 22:39.691
It fell out of its nest
while learning to fly.

22:39.775 --> 22:43.320
I told her to leave it alone,
that its mother would take care of it.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.821
She was worried about the cat.

22:45.822 --> 22:50.285
So she shredded a bunch of newspapers
and made a really nice nest.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.997
It was until you tried to feed it.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.168
How long did it last? A day? Two?

22:58.752 --> 23:02.255
-Stop this.
-You mean well, honey. You really do.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.802
But do you really think
you know what's best?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.015
-[gasps]
-No. No!

23:12.099 --> 23:14.226
-[choking]
-It's sad.

23:15.352 --> 23:19.356
With us, you could have been magnificent.
You could have been free.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.150
But now, you'll never know.

23:26.113 --> 23:26.947
Iara.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.492
-No, no, no, no, no. Iara!
-[gasps]

23:33.453 --> 23:36.289
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.461
-Niko's alive.
-You saw her? What did you see?

23:41.545 --> 23:42.546
Uh… [sighs]

23:42.629 --> 23:45.132
It was some kind of simulation.
She was on Earth…

23:45.215 --> 23:47.175
-[William] She saw Niko.
-Alive.

23:47.259 --> 23:51.388
-Was she hurt or locked up?
-She was dressed up. Like, for a party.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.766
-She wasn't in her space suit?
-Not in the simulation.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.435
-But in reality?
-[Iara] She was alive.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.812
We spoke. I was the one in danger.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.439
You?

24:01.314 --> 24:02.899
And they were not happy.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.824
You can't go over there.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.368
They know we sent Iara.
There's your act of aggression.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.621
We are at war, Commander.
You need to stop and think like a soldier.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.124
We sent in a spy. She got exposed.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.084
Niko's alive for now,
but for how much longer?

24:21.168 --> 24:24.171
What we need to do is start making
preparations to return to Earth,

24:24.254 --> 24:26.089
and not let
your emotional attachment to Niko

24:26.173 --> 24:29.426
-be the downfall of this entire mission.
-We are sitting ducks, Richard.

24:29.509 --> 24:30.886
If we jump back to Earth now,

24:30.969 --> 24:33.722
they'll be right on our tails,
and we'll be right back where we started.

24:34.181 --> 24:39.186
So you need to stop, think,
do the job that Niko woke you up to do,

24:39.853 --> 24:41.938
which is to help us find a better way
to get back.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.232
In the meantime, I'm going to get Niko.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.985
Not because of some
emotional attachment bullshit,

24:47.068 --> 24:49.821
but because she is
the highest ranking member of this crew,

24:49.905 --> 24:53.158
and I will not let Niko or any
of the classified information she holds

24:53.241 --> 24:54.576
fall into enemy hands.

24:56.411 --> 24:59.873
Once you leave this ship,
the Salvare is under my command,

24:59.956 --> 25:02.918
and I will do whatever I have to do
to get us back to Earth.

25:04.377 --> 25:05.212
Understood?

25:06.171 --> 25:07.214
Understood.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.551
The shuttle bay's
on the other side of the ship.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.304
I'm not taking a shuttle.
They'll see me coming in that.

25:15.805 --> 25:16.848
[sighs]

25:21.269 --> 25:25.315
We trusted you,
invited you on to our ship,

25:25.398 --> 25:27.526
made you feel welcome.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.861
And you sent in your thief.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.863
Not a thief.

25:32.822 --> 25:36.117
If my crew sent Iara, it's because
they think that I'm in danger.

25:37.744 --> 25:40.330
They hacked this ship, Niko.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.290
Stole information!

25:42.874 --> 25:46.336
-We know nothing about you.
-You could have tried asking.

25:47.170 --> 25:50.090
I'm here, asking.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.218
How many of you are there?

25:53.843 --> 25:55.053
On this ship?

25:55.720 --> 25:56.555
Out there?

25:57.889 --> 26:00.183
Uh, how long
have you been exploring space?

26:01.518 --> 26:02.727
What do you want?

26:03.436 --> 26:04.604
What do you want from us?

26:08.775 --> 26:09.901
I've told you.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.487
Peace.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.913
We are trying
to offer you a way home, Niko.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.749
Not until you answer the questions.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.503
[groans]

26:28.587 --> 26:30.839
You've always been so strong.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.717
I never realized

26:34.884 --> 26:38.638
how much you need protection.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.933
Let me help you.

26:42.684 --> 26:43.727
Let me be a mother.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.438
Once again,

26:47.897 --> 26:52.068
you are not my mother,
and I don't need protecting.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.948
And if you want me
to deliver some kind of message for you,

26:57.032 --> 26:59.409
you need to start
by telling me the fucking truth,

26:59.492 --> 27:01.244
what you actually want from us.

27:01.328 --> 27:05.498
Otherwise, I will never tell Earth
that the Achaia come in peace.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.340
You're absolutely right, Niko.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.051
We haven't been clear with you.

27:17.510 --> 27:20.555
So let's try this again, shall we?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.233
[crow cawing]

27:32.317 --> 27:33.652
[sighs]

28:23.201 --> 28:25.203
[crows cawing]

28:38.967 --> 28:40.760
I let you down, sweetheart.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.888
I let you both down.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.726
And I'm so sorry.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.575
We were supposed to protect her.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.455
How'd she die?

29:12.542 --> 29:13.626
She got sick.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.297
-She got better.
-She got sick again.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.550
How?

29:22.260 --> 29:25.680
You know, we promised each other
the day that she was born

29:25.764 --> 29:27.599
that we'd always keep her safe.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.727
That we'd love her.

29:32.353 --> 29:33.897
And that you would be there for her

29:33.980 --> 29:36.983
the way that your mother
was never there for you.

29:40.153 --> 29:41.196
But she died.

29:42.405 --> 29:47.035
You left, she got sick, and she died.

29:48.453 --> 29:52.665
Crying for you, Niko.
Crying for her mother.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.504
Threatening me with my daughter's life?

29:58.838 --> 30:00.507
That's how you negotiate?

30:02.592 --> 30:05.512
There is no future for us and the Achaia.

30:07.180 --> 30:12.060
And if you want me to choose
between humanity and my daughter…

30:19.108 --> 30:20.777
I choose humanity.

30:23.738 --> 30:25.740
[rattling]

30:28.326 --> 30:30.995
[screeching]

30:31.079 --> 30:32.831
[thunder rumbling]

30:33.498 --> 30:34.499
It's okay.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.626
I understand.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.049
[groans]

30:43.132 --> 30:45.343
-[yells]
-It's okay!

30:45.426 --> 30:47.053
[muffled screaming]

30:47.136 --> 30:48.388
[yells]

30:49.514 --> 30:52.308
[gasps] You're not my husband. Stay back.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.812
-[yells] I said stay back.
-Aaah.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.482
Choosin' the wrong side.

31:02.485 --> 31:04.737
[Niko yelling]

31:19.419 --> 31:20.295
[Erik growls]

31:21.212 --> 31:25.008
You were always gonna choose
the mission over us.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.302
-[grunting]
-Hmm?

31:27.385 --> 31:30.847
You're exactly like your mother.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.353
[screams]

31:37.437 --> 31:38.688
[groans]

31:39.647 --> 31:41.482
[screams]

31:41.566 --> 31:43.401
[screeching]

31:44.193 --> 31:45.486
[Niko gasps]

31:50.283 --> 31:51.451
[pained screeching]

31:51.534 --> 31:52.452
[grunts]

31:52.535 --> 31:54.537
[gasping]

31:54.621 --> 31:55.455
Niko!

31:56.581 --> 31:58.333
-Talks didn't go so well.
-No shit.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.960
[gasps] We need
to get back to the shuttle, come on!

32:01.044 --> 32:02.712
[Niko panting]

32:08.301 --> 32:09.594
[shuffling]

32:10.929 --> 32:11.846
Daddy?

32:13.097 --> 32:15.308
Hey. No, no, no, no. Hey. Take it easy.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.101
But I feel fine.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.355
I know you do, because you're all better.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.024
Just like they promised.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.568
-I'm not sick?
-Not anymore.

32:33.743 --> 32:34.577
Look.

32:35.078 --> 32:35.954
What?

32:45.213 --> 32:46.381
Jana, honey.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.133
This is your mother's ring.

32:51.678 --> 32:52.887
Where did you get this?

32:53.388 --> 32:57.141
I saw her in the Artifact.
She told me to keep it safe for her.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.693
[Erik] All right.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.536
You don't have a spare
English-Achaian dictionary on you, do you?

33:16.619 --> 33:20.123
-You can't make heads or tails of it?
-Do Achaians have heads or tails?

33:20.665 --> 33:21.708
You tell me.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.795
You got a problem with me?

33:26.629 --> 33:29.424
No. Just with that thing in your head.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.592
Okay, well, at least you're honest.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.635
I'm always honest.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.471
I'm pickin' up four more Achaian vessels
headed straight for us.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.557
-[siren blaring]
-[sighs] We can't stay here.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.184
Cas and Niko are still on that ship.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.436
Get ready to jump.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.487
-I need your help one more time.
-I'm not going back in there.

33:51.571 --> 33:54.323
-You are, and you'll get us a head start.
-How?

33:54.407 --> 33:56.617
Disable their ship, disrupt their sensors.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.704
Whatever you can do.
Buy us enough time to jump.

33:59.787 --> 34:02.707
-It'll give us minutes, at best.
-That's all I need.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.250
So go over there and do it.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.044
Ironic, isn't it?

34:06.919 --> 34:10.089
I help you get us out of here,
I'm the one still stuck in this cage.

34:12.175 --> 34:16.596
Do this, hack the Achaian ship,
and I'll drop your firewalls.

34:19.557 --> 34:21.309
How do I know you'll be true to your word?

34:22.185 --> 34:23.269
What's the alternative?

34:25.229 --> 34:28.066
Salvare, do you copy?
We're back at the shuttle.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.902
-[Cas] William, Richard, do you copy?
-[Niko] Guys?

34:36.157 --> 34:38.076
The comms are down. They can't hear us.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.744
They're starting up the FTL drive.
