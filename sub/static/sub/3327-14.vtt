This is the part

00:55.862 --> 00:57.762
We're robbing you.

00:57.763 --> 01:00.893
Well, I don't suppose
you could finish the show first.

01:00.993 --> 01:03.560

keep in the house?

01:03.562 --> 01:05.692
Never been robbed by people
in their underwear before.

Fine.

01:14.985 --> 01:16.151
You know,

01:16.153 --> 01:17.703
I'd heard rumors

01:17.705 --> 01:19.321
of two prostitutes

01:19.323 --> 01:21.657
who bind innocent whoremongers
and then rob them.

01:21.659 --> 01:24.660
But to think that those
two women ended up in my home

01:24.662 --> 01:26.361
on-on this very evening...

01:26.363 --> 01:28.697

I should thank you.

01:28.699 --> 01:31.500
I usually investigate crimes

Just one question

01:44.682 --> 01:46.732
Can I keep these?

01:53.723 --> 01:56.525
I'm glad your bust
was such a success last night,

smells like stripper.

Yeah.

What's with the sword?

02:02.666 --> 02:04.199
It's not a sword,
it's a singlestick.

02:04.201 --> 02:06.234

or something.

02:29.593 --> 02:31.026
I confess, Watson.

Propofol. I'll wager
we'll find that here.

when he yanked

<i>the IV from his arm.</i>

08:46.130 --> 08:48.797
The heart rate?
The pulse? What...?

08:48.799 --> 08:50.716
It's common knowledge,
the fakirs of Bangladesh

08:50.718 --> 08:53.102

their circulatory systems

08:54.838 --> 08:57.640
This man was

be stained with blood.

09:00.511 --> 09:03.946

gun at whoever he needed to,

09:03.948 --> 09:05.681
walked out the front door.

09:05.683 --> 09:07.849

The traditional name

of the Cassiopeia constellation.

I've pursued.

09:50.227 --> 09:52.027
What's she doing here?

Kathryn Drummond.

09:56.784 --> 09:58.066

an American serial killer
came to London.

10:07.411 --> 10:09.628
She's a buffoon.
All profilers are.

10:09.630 --> 10:11.547

are caught.

10:19.807 --> 10:21.690
Isn't profiling part
of what you do?

Where's your captain?

10:43.047 --> 10:44.496

10:44.498 --> 10:45.748
a four-quadrant search

Did you know
that Patricia Ennis,

10:48.085 --> 10:50.619
Howard Ennis's sister,
is a patient here?

10:50.621 --> 10:52.755
Why not talk
to her first?

10:52.757 --> 10:54.590
She was the one he was
ostensibly here to help,

10:54.592 --> 10:56.625
so maybe she has some insight
as to where he's gone.

10:56.627 --> 10:58.560
Oh, no. Wait.

10:58.562 --> 11:01.463
Your book, that's right.
What was it called?

11:01.465 --> 11:03.131
<i>Profiles in Terror.</i>

11:03.133 --> 11:05.901
Yes, Ms. Drummond
wrote a book

11:05.903 --> 11:07.353
about Howard Ennis
after she caught him.

11:07.355 --> 11:08.804
Got into a spot of bother

11:08.806 --> 11:10.439
when she speculated
about the sexual abuse

11:10.441 --> 11:11.807
he must surely have suffered

11:11.809 --> 11:13.075
at the hands
of his parents,

11:13.077 --> 11:14.576
because they said
it was a lie.

11:14.578 --> 11:15.861
Sued you for libel,

11:15.863 --> 11:17.997
correct?
That got thrown out of court.

11:19.449 --> 11:21.033
Nice to meet you.

11:23.870 --> 11:25.371
This never would have
happened if...

11:25.373 --> 11:28.540
if I hadn't gotten
Howard out of prison.

11:28.542 --> 11:29.792
It's not your fault.

11:29.794 --> 11:32.127
No, but after I got sick,

11:32.129 --> 11:33.796
I asked the doctor

11:33.798 --> 11:36.982
if there was
any other way.

11:36.984 --> 11:40.669
I didn't want any part
of him inside of me.

11:40.671 --> 11:42.337
But the waiting list

11:42.339 --> 11:44.673
for the transplant
was so long.

11:44.675 --> 11:46.475
The-the doctor
said that a...

11:46.477 --> 11:48.944
a sibling would be
the best match.

11:48.946 --> 11:50.129

11:50.131 --> 11:51.563
where your brother
might have gone?

11:51.565 --> 11:53.782

for the kidney, we hadn't

11:53.784 --> 11:56.518
spoken in years.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.320
I have some letters
that he wrote me.

11:58.322 --> 12:00.155
I could give you those
if you want.

12:00.157 --> 12:01.740
Yes, that
would be very helpful.

12:01.742 --> 12:03.859
Thank you.

12:06.162 --> 12:09.248
Is she gonna be part

12:09.250 --> 12:10.966
She is, but you

12:10.968 --> 12:11.967
won't have to...

12:11.969 --> 12:14.169
So glad she's helping.

12:14.171 --> 12:16.221
Howard needs to be stopped.

12:17.674 --> 12:19.591

she can do it again.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.866
You know the Conklins
up on three?

12:43.868 --> 12:45.233
Yeah, of course.

12:45.235 --> 12:47.402
Their son's a
teenager now.

12:47.404 --> 12:49.905
He went to certain...

12:49.907 --> 12:51.540
Web pages.

12:51.542 --> 12:54.460
So Mrs. Conklin
learns about it.

12:54.462 --> 12:55.911
Checks the
search history

12:55.913 --> 12:58.580
to see what her boy's
been exposed to.

12:58.582 --> 13:00.549
She found a pornographic film

13:00.551 --> 13:02.718
that was made right here,

13:02.720 --> 13:03.969
in this apartment.

13:03.971 --> 13:05.521
What are you talking about?

13:05.523 --> 13:08.524
The guy you sublet the
apartment to-- Cooper?

13:08.526 --> 13:11.193
He's been shooting
pornography here.

13:17.867 --> 13:20.652
Hi.

13:20.654 --> 13:22.738
I take it your meeting
did not go well.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.606
You haven't asked
why I'm lying on the table.

13:24.608 --> 13:26.408
You are clearly distracted.

13:26.410 --> 13:29.044
My subletter filmed
a pornographic movie

13:29.046 --> 13:32.113
in my apartment, so now
I'm getting evicted.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.583
Well, I suppose now you can do
as I suggested:

13:34.585 --> 13:36.552
live as a wandering nomad
of sobriety.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.921
I don't want to be a
wandering nomad of sobriety.

13:38.923 --> 13:40.622
I want my own space.

13:40.624 --> 13:41.863
Well, perhaps I could
help you reclaim it.

13:41.888 --> 13:42.625
No.

13:42.626 --> 13:44.459
I mean...

13:44.461 --> 13:45.928
I appreciate it;
it's just that

13:45.930 --> 13:47.763
I want my apartment
the way it was before

13:47.765 --> 13:50.349
it was... violated.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.601
Yeah, I-I saw some of the
movie while I was there.

13:52.603 --> 13:54.520
I don't think I could
live there again.

13:57.974 --> 13:59.808
Why are you lying
on the table?

13:59.810 --> 14:01.777
I'm looking at the stars.

14:03.780 --> 14:05.314
That's Cassiopeia,

14:05.316 --> 14:08.484
oriented as it appears now
in the night sky.

14:08.486 --> 14:13.321
It fits precisely into a map
of Manhattan of that scale.

14:13.323 --> 14:16.291
The first "X" is Shedir,
the first star.

14:16.293 --> 14:17.960
Site of this morning's murders
in Greenwich Village.

14:17.962 --> 14:20.161
That would put the second star
in Turtle Bay,

14:20.163 --> 14:22.497
somewhere near the U.N;
the third star, Columbus Circle.

14:22.499 --> 14:24.099
You get the idea.
This is a map

14:24.101 --> 14:25.467
of where Ennis plans
to kill people.

14:25.469 --> 14:27.102
This is important.

14:27.104 --> 14:28.437
Did you tell anyone yet?

14:28.439 --> 14:29.838
They're all very excited.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.274
Resources being reallocated
as we speak.

14:32.276 --> 14:33.675
Trouble is,

14:33.677 --> 14:35.110
I think it's all bollocks.

14:35.112 --> 14:36.812
Wait, you think you're wrong?

14:36.814 --> 14:40.115
I think I cracked a code
that was intended to be cracked.

14:40.117 --> 14:41.683
I think

14:41.685 --> 14:43.518
he wants the police
directing resources

14:43.520 --> 14:46.238
to these locations so he can,
I don't know, watch them.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.957
Like mice running a maze
of his own design.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.826
Oh, speaking of vermin.

14:51.995 --> 14:53.328
What is it with you

14:53.330 --> 14:54.997
and that woman?

14:54.999 --> 14:57.332
It's obviously more
than just hating profilers.

14:57.334 --> 15:00.002
If you're asking if we had sex,
the answer is yes, obviously.

15:00.004 --> 15:03.038
Oh, so she's an ex?

15:03.040 --> 15:04.673
More like a "C," C-plus at best.

15:04.675 --> 15:06.758
We had an arrangement
while she was in London,

15:06.760 --> 15:08.143
similar to the arrangement

15:08.145 --> 15:10.012
I have with other women
here in New York.

15:10.014 --> 15:11.880
We performed the act of love
loudly and repeatedly,

15:11.882 --> 15:14.266
without any actual love,
or even any like.

15:14.268 --> 15:16.551
I would describe it as an act
of self-love were it not

15:16.553 --> 15:17.623
for the fact that she
was technically present.

15:17.648 --> 15:18.605
I get it.

15:18.606 --> 15:20.522
Now I would just prefer her
not to send

15:20.524 --> 15:22.284
the police on an ego-driven
wild goose chase.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.277
We updated the profile

15:25.279 --> 15:26.862
to reflect our
latest thinking.

15:26.864 --> 15:29.064
Captain, I know Ms. Drummond
is entitled to her say,

15:29.066 --> 15:30.782
but before you imbibe
any profiling snake oil,

15:30.784 --> 15:32.400
I would like to offer
my own assessment.

15:32.402 --> 15:33.702
We're in the middle
of a meeting here.

15:33.704 --> 15:36.204
Cassiopeia code
is certainly alluring.

15:36.206 --> 15:38.006
Perhaps too alluring.

15:38.008 --> 15:39.708
Howard Ennis
is not a spree killer.

15:39.710 --> 15:41.677
I believe he is trying
to distract us.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.078
He'll lie low, he'll
change his appearance,

15:43.080 --> 15:45.047
but eventually,
he will pick up a blade,

15:45.049 --> 15:46.748
and he will find
another young blonde.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.684
Is that it?

15:48.686 --> 15:52.087
Ms. Drummond's
latest profile.

15:52.089 --> 15:54.640
Basically, it says
what you just said.

15:54.642 --> 15:57.726
Ennis had to know
we'd break the code.

15:57.728 --> 15:59.928
I didn't know you were capable
of that level of thinking,

15:59.930 --> 16:01.763
but you have been exposed
to my methods, so...

16:01.765 --> 16:02.931
I-I don't know what's

16:02.933 --> 16:04.432
going on between you two,

16:04.434 --> 16:06.434
but the important thing
to me is that

16:06.436 --> 16:08.370
my top consultant
and the Bureau's top profiler

16:08.372 --> 16:10.622
agree with each other.

16:13.042 --> 16:14.993
The Public Employees Federation

16:14.995 --> 16:17.829
sued the state...

16:17.831 --> 16:19.998
... it argues that
the Health Department

16:20.000 --> 16:21.533
overstepped its authority

16:21.535 --> 16:23.936
by forcing employees
to be vaccinated

16:23.938 --> 16:26.138
by November 30.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.960
The Health Department
says it will fight...

16:41.471 --> 16:43.638
Oh, God! Please...

16:43.640 --> 16:45.424
Please... don't...

16:45.426 --> 16:48.476
Will you do me a favor?

16:49.645 --> 16:51.196
Would you mind taking

16:51.198 --> 16:52.948
my picture with
your phone?

17:09.369 --> 17:12.424
He walked into the store
and shot everyone here

17:12.523 --> 17:13.790
except for the
one person

17:13.791 --> 17:17.227
that actually fits
his victim profile.

17:17.229 --> 17:19.445
You two said he
would lie low.

17:19.448 --> 17:21.481
Change his appearance.

17:21.483 --> 17:22.983
Is this what you call lying low?

17:22.984 --> 17:24.567
I confess,
a crime like this

17:24.569 --> 17:26.569
is out of character
for Howard Ennis.

17:26.570 --> 17:29.606
But it doesn't invalidate
anything I wrote in my report.

17:29.608 --> 17:31.942
The register was robbed.

17:31.944 --> 17:33.243
Stands to reason

17:33.245 --> 17:35.312
Howard Ennis would have
varied his routine

17:35.314 --> 17:37.180
because he needed cash
to get out of town.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.965
Poppycock.
Excuse me?

17:38.967 --> 17:40.333
Poppycock.

17:40.335 --> 17:41.868
The desperate rhetorical
contortions of someone

17:41.870 --> 17:44.203
with a pathological
need to be right.

17:44.205 --> 17:46.339
Same old Sherlock Holmes.

17:46.341 --> 17:47.540
Look around you.

17:47.542 --> 17:49.509
Howard Ennis,
despite his many flaws,

17:49.511 --> 17:51.011
is not a complete moron.

17:51.013 --> 17:52.211
If money had been his goal,

17:52.213 --> 17:53.713
why would he rob
a place like this?

17:53.715 --> 17:55.598
What's the most he could
have gotten away with?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.884
$200, maybe $300?
Doesn't take much to go on the lam.

17:57.886 --> 17:59.686
Then explain
his decision to leave

17:59.688 --> 18:01.187
that woman alive.

18:01.189 --> 18:02.388
You can't, can you?

18:02.390 --> 18:03.390
'Cause you and I
both know

18:03.391 --> 18:04.441
that her
crossing his path

18:04.443 --> 18:05.659
was like
a piece of chum

18:05.661 --> 18:07.827
crossing the path
of a ravenous shark.

18:07.829 --> 18:09.112
You think he's sending
a message?

18:09.114 --> 18:10.497
I do.

18:10.499 --> 18:13.566
I just don't know
what it is.

18:18.622 --> 18:22.241
You told me you were a
documentary filmmaker.

18:22.243 --> 18:23.877
Bruce talked to you.

18:23.879 --> 18:26.629
No, Cooper, I just watch
a ton of porn.

18:26.631 --> 18:28.748
Imagine my surprise
when I saw a bunch of people

18:28.750 --> 18:30.884
having sex in my living room,
on my couch.

18:30.886 --> 18:32.302
Okay, you're angry.

18:32.304 --> 18:34.688
You totally should be.
You think?

18:34.690 --> 18:36.589
Look, for what it's worth,
I really did want

18:36.591 --> 18:38.725
to make a movie about
child soldiers in the Sudan.

18:38.727 --> 18:40.760
But, what, a bunch
of porn actors broke in here

18:40.762 --> 18:42.479
and forced you
to film them instead?

18:42.481 --> 18:44.197
I needed the money.

18:44.199 --> 18:46.399
I-I couldn't get anyone
to invest in the documentary,

18:46.401 --> 18:48.935
so I had to turn back
to alternative filmmaking

18:48.937 --> 18:50.436
to pay the rent.

18:50.438 --> 18:52.155
Wait a second,
what do you mean, "turn back"?

18:52.157 --> 18:53.439
You mean you made other "films"?

18:53.441 --> 18:55.375
Not here.

18:55.377 --> 18:56.993
But yeah.

18:56.995 --> 18:58.277
I'm sorry.

18:58.279 --> 18:59.496
Joan, seriously,
if I had the money,

18:59.498 --> 19:00.547
I would have shot it

19:00.549 --> 19:01.614
anywhere but here.

19:01.616 --> 19:02.882
Man, did this
get screwed up!

19:02.884 --> 19:04.283
After you took

19:04.285 --> 19:05.835
the apartment back,
I was gonna ask you out!

19:11.625 --> 19:14.511
How did it go
with your friend the auteur?

19:14.513 --> 19:17.130
Didn't talk you
into a sequel, did he?

19:17.132 --> 19:18.681
He's not my friend.

19:18.683 --> 19:20.633
And he's getting kicked out,
same as me.

19:20.635 --> 19:21.634
How's it going here?

19:21.636 --> 19:23.353
Poorly.

19:23.355 --> 19:25.438
I detached myself from the
Ennis manhunt several hours ago.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.191
I thought I could be
more use to the police here.

19:28.193 --> 19:30.243
Trying to decipher his game.

19:30.245 --> 19:31.310
I was wrong.

19:35.149 --> 19:36.249
That's mature.

19:36.251 --> 19:37.450
Started out as a

19:37.452 --> 19:39.619
simple mustache,
if you can believe it.

19:39.621 --> 19:42.372
I know why you
don't like her.

19:42.374 --> 19:45.324
You recall my aversion
to bile-spewing

19:45.326 --> 19:46.559
pig-women?

19:46.561 --> 19:47.544
"The Deductionist."

19:47.546 --> 19:49.546
An article she wrote

19:49.548 --> 19:52.582
for a psychiatric
journal ten years ago,

19:52.584 --> 19:53.833
about a police consultant
she met

19:53.835 --> 19:55.468
while on assignment in London.

19:55.470 --> 19:57.003
A man she said was
"in possession

19:57.005 --> 19:59.522
of a uniquely potent
deductive mind."

20:01.442 --> 20:03.810
You seem genuinely
upset by her today.

20:03.812 --> 20:06.679
So, I Googled her,
and I found the article.

20:06.681 --> 20:09.649
She never referred to
you by name, but still,

20:09.651 --> 20:10.950
some of the things
that she wrote...

20:10.952 --> 20:12.518
When I first met
Kathryn Drummond,

20:12.520 --> 20:14.954
she showed a modicum
of potential as an investigator.

20:14.956 --> 20:17.907
So, aside from our
extracurricular exertions,

20:17.909 --> 20:20.526
I tried to tutor her
in my methods.

20:20.528 --> 20:22.662
She seemed quite amenable,
at the time.

20:22.664 --> 20:24.964
Little did I know she was merely
interested in gaining

20:24.966 --> 20:28.585
a better understanding of
the inner workings of my mind.

20:28.587 --> 20:30.003
She was profiling you.

20:30.005 --> 20:32.538
Well, that's one word
for it, yes.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.808
Discovering the betrayal
was one thing;

20:34.810 --> 20:36.342
discovering that she
was far more perceptive

20:36.344 --> 20:38.645
than I realized
was quite another.

20:38.647 --> 20:40.146
She predicted my struggles
with addiction.

20:40.148 --> 20:43.216
She saw it coming; I did not.

20:43.218 --> 20:45.185
Is that what this is all about?

20:45.187 --> 20:47.854
The fact that she...
she got one thing right?

20:47.856 --> 20:50.106
It was, as you will recall
from the piece,

20:50.108 --> 20:52.558
one of several quite
alarming prognostications

20:52.560 --> 20:54.611
she made regarding my future.

20:54.613 --> 20:57.363
One of several methods
by which I might self-destruct.

20:57.365 --> 20:59.999
And if she was right
about one...

21:00.001 --> 21:02.452
well...

21:03.721 --> 21:05.839
<i>We got a city in panic.</i>

21:05.841 --> 21:08.291
We got seven dead bodies
in the morgue.

21:08.293 --> 21:10.176
Now, I know my guys are

21:10.178 --> 21:11.577
everything they can
to find Howard Ennis.

21:11.579 --> 21:13.713
And you're
the so-called

21:13.715 --> 21:15.131
Howard Ennis expert.

21:15.133 --> 21:16.716
You don't seem to have
the first clue

21:16.718 --> 21:18.134
what he's up to next.
I admit,

21:18.136 --> 21:19.919
Howard Ennis's behavior
up to this point

21:19.921 --> 21:21.888
has been perplexing.

21:21.890 --> 21:23.473
It contradicts

21:23.475 --> 21:25.725
everything I've come
to know about the man.

21:25.727 --> 21:27.810
Maybe the chaos is the point.

21:29.146 --> 21:30.363
The randomness,

21:30.365 --> 21:32.098
the deliberate
flouting

21:32.100 --> 21:33.566
of his profile.

21:33.568 --> 21:35.568
Maybe he wants to confuse you.

21:35.570 --> 21:37.203
Ms. Watson has
a point, Captain.

21:37.205 --> 21:38.738
Yesterday, I posited that Ennis

21:38.740 --> 21:40.540
was attempting
to send us a message.

21:40.542 --> 21:43.710
Today, I would posit that
the confusion is the message.

21:43.712 --> 21:45.828
Captain, it's Ennis.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.547
He just called
the station, asked

21:47.549 --> 21:49.782
to speak to the person in
charge of the task force.

21:49.784 --> 21:51.467
I got him on hold
in your office.

21:54.171 --> 21:56.055
This is Captain Gregson
of the NYPD.

21:56.057 --> 21:59.092
Hello, Captain Gregson
of the NYPD.

21:59.094 --> 22:00.793
This is Howard Ennis.

22:00.795 --> 22:03.062
May I assume that my old friend

22:03.064 --> 22:04.797
Ms. Drummond is listening in?

22:04.799 --> 22:06.633
Say your piece, Mr. Ennis.

22:06.635 --> 22:08.735
I'll take that as a yes.

22:08.737 --> 22:12.355
I saw you on the news
yesterday, Kathryn.

22:12.357 --> 22:15.474
You are not aging well.

22:15.476 --> 22:18.695
I'm calling because I thought
it was time

22:18.697 --> 22:20.580
that I explained what I'm up to.

22:20.582 --> 22:22.481
Actually, Mr. Ennis,
that won't be necessary.

22:22.483 --> 22:23.482
Excuse me?

22:23.484 --> 22:25.919
Well, I just figured it out.

22:25.921 --> 22:28.871
This is entirely
about Ms. Drummond, correct?

22:28.873 --> 22:30.423
You despise her.

22:30.425 --> 22:32.926
Why? Well, obvious answer
is that she's the agent

22:32.928 --> 22:34.294
most responsible
for your capture,

22:34.296 --> 22:36.596
but I think there's more
to it than that.

22:36.598 --> 22:39.999
You detest her because she...
solved you.

22:40.001 --> 22:41.634
She climbed inside your head,

22:41.636 --> 22:43.502
she pulled all
your ugly secrets out

22:43.504 --> 22:44.837
and exposed them.

22:44.839 --> 22:46.505
She demystified you.

22:46.507 --> 22:49.342
And now you're doing everything
in your power to...

22:49.344 --> 22:52.278
violate her profile of you,
rail against it,

22:52.280 --> 22:57.116
show everyone that, well,
you never really were solved.

22:57.118 --> 22:59.819
I like you.

22:59.821 --> 23:02.688
I know who you are.

23:02.690 --> 23:04.991
The Deductionist.

23:04.993 --> 23:07.293
Accent gave you away.

23:07.295 --> 23:09.912
You see, I did a lot
of reading in prison.

23:09.914 --> 23:12.332
I, uh, found everything
Kathryn ever wrote.

23:12.334 --> 23:15.335
And, by the way, you're right.

23:15.337 --> 23:18.671
I do want to humiliate Kathryn.

23:18.673 --> 23:22.375
But not because
of what she did to me.

23:22.377 --> 23:25.595
Because of what she did
to my family.

23:25.597 --> 23:27.597
Family? Are you
serious, Howard?

23:27.599 --> 23:31.017
Didn't you just abandon your
dying sister in a hospital?

23:32.603 --> 23:35.221
My father was a good man.

23:35.223 --> 23:38.157
Wasn't his fault
that I ended up the way I did.

23:38.159 --> 23:39.942
But you, Kathryn...

23:39.944 --> 23:44.697
you alleged that he abused me
on a regular basis,

23:44.699 --> 23:47.700
that he made me into the man
that I am today.

23:47.702 --> 23:49.535
You know as
well as I know

23:49.537 --> 23:52.538
that there were multiple
allegations of abuse.

23:52.540 --> 23:55.375
My father, as most
of you probably know,

23:55.377 --> 24:00.079
hung himself in his garage a few
months after the book came out.

24:01.715 --> 24:04.717
My mother never really
got over it.

24:04.719 --> 24:07.520
She died less than a year later.

24:07.522 --> 24:09.906
If you ask me, Kathryn,

24:09.908 --> 24:13.476
you all but put a gun
to their heads.

24:16.146 --> 24:18.764
You want me to stop doing
what I'm doing,

24:18.766 --> 24:20.900
Captain Gregson of the NYPD?

24:20.902 --> 24:23.603
All you have

24:23.605 --> 24:25.605
to do...

24:25.607 --> 24:28.741
is give me Kathryn Drummond.

24:31.746 --> 24:34.797
I think his demands
are quite reasonable.

24:54.807 --> 24:56.557
A wall of newspaper clippings.

24:56.559 --> 25:00.094
Journals filled
with his innermost inanities.

25:00.096 --> 25:03.064
Souvenirs from the women
he murdered.

25:03.066 --> 25:06.651
Ennis seems resolved
to leave no cliché unturned.

25:06.653 --> 25:09.270
So we're no closer to finding
him than we were an hour ago.

25:09.272 --> 25:11.105
I'm not so sure about that.

25:11.107 --> 25:12.540
Standing inside

25:12.542 --> 25:14.242
this space is like standing

25:14.244 --> 25:16.443
inside Howard Ennis's brain.

25:16.445 --> 25:18.663
It's hard to imagine there isn't
something of value here.

25:18.665 --> 25:20.748
Actually, it's quite easy
to imagine.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.750
He let us find
this place.

25:22.752 --> 25:24.335
He left his cell phone here

25:24.337 --> 25:25.753
so we could
triangulate its signal.

25:25.755 --> 25:27.672
Why? 'Cause he's making a point.

25:27.674 --> 25:31.125
This room represents who he was,
not who he is.

25:31.127 --> 25:32.626
If there was anything
of value here,

25:32.628 --> 25:34.295
Ennis never would
have led us to it.

25:34.297 --> 25:36.463
Were you not listening
when I explained his plan

25:36.465 --> 25:38.432
to become profile-proof?

25:44.406 --> 25:46.407
Just out of curiosity,

25:46.409 --> 25:48.409
how accurate were
your allegations

25:48.411 --> 25:50.411
against the Ennis family?

25:50.413 --> 25:53.414
The first allegations of sexual
abuse came in your profile,

25:53.416 --> 25:55.199
but that was just
pure speculation.

25:55.201 --> 25:56.984
Your book, on
the other hand,

25:56.986 --> 25:59.587
you quoted an anonymous
source, a neighbor who claimed

25:59.589 --> 26:01.989
that Ennis had confided
in him about the abuses.

26:01.991 --> 26:03.991
So? What are you saying?

26:03.993 --> 26:06.294
Well, I'm saying that you've
been known to cut corners.

26:06.296 --> 26:08.379
In the article you wrote
about me, for example,

26:08.381 --> 26:10.664
you included things that I
had said to you privately

26:10.666 --> 26:12.600
as though they were
quotes for attribution.

26:12.602 --> 26:14.001
You did say them, though.

26:14.003 --> 26:15.803
And my article was right
about you.

26:15.805 --> 26:16.938
So far.

26:16.940 --> 26:18.672
So, was there a neighbor?

26:18.674 --> 26:20.892
Or were you just guessing about
Ennis being sexually abused?

26:20.894 --> 26:23.510
Ennis's pathology was consistent
with sexual abuse.

26:23.512 --> 26:25.346
I've chased men like him
for 20 years.

26:25.348 --> 26:26.731
It's been present
every single time.

26:26.733 --> 26:28.515
Doesn't mean
it was present here.

26:28.517 --> 26:30.618
So, if you were wrong,
it was a costly mistake.

26:30.620 --> 26:33.187
Ennis's father quoted your
book in his suicide note.

26:33.189 --> 26:35.656
You spurred Howard to
eight murders and counting.

26:35.658 --> 26:37.825
Oh, like Howard Ennis needs
a reason to kill people.

26:37.827 --> 26:39.794
Maybe he doesn't, but he
didn't have this reason

26:39.796 --> 26:41.662
until you came along.

26:41.664 --> 26:44.365
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

26:44.367 --> 26:47.201
You need anything?

26:48.837 --> 26:52.640
I know that Kathryn Drummond
is obsessed with her work.

26:52.642 --> 26:58.629
She prides herself on the...
accuracy of her profiles.

26:58.631 --> 27:02.633
But to think she would've gone
so far as to destroy a family

27:02.635 --> 27:04.735
to lend credence
to one of her claims.

27:05.988 --> 27:07.989
Did you ever consider
the possibility

27:07.991 --> 27:09.824
that she lied about you
in the article?

27:09.826 --> 27:11.558
What would she have to gain?

27:11.560 --> 27:13.861
I was never revealed as
the subject in the article.

27:13.863 --> 27:15.062
No one ever compared me

27:15.064 --> 27:17.665
to it.

27:17.667 --> 27:21.168
Anyway, she got
a good deal right.

27:21.170 --> 27:23.287
She predicted your drug problem.
So what?

27:23.289 --> 27:25.539
You got clean.
You picked up

27:25.541 --> 27:27.174
your career
right where you left off.

27:27.176 --> 27:28.843
And you even made a friend,

27:28.845 --> 27:30.845
something that Kathryn
claimed in her article

27:30.847 --> 27:33.364
was virtually
impossible.

27:34.333 --> 27:35.582
Me.

27:37.085 --> 27:38.585
I'm talking about me.

27:38.587 --> 27:41.038
Look, my point
is that...

27:41.040 --> 27:43.424
the only thing
that anyone can predict

27:43.426 --> 27:46.560
about people with 100% certainty
is that they'll change.

27:46.562 --> 27:48.579
And anyone
who thinks otherwise

27:48.581 --> 27:50.615
is kidding themselves.

27:52.734 --> 27:54.601
Oh, my God. Is that...

27:54.603 --> 27:55.936
You have a lovely
home, Watson.

27:55.938 --> 27:57.371
Excellent light.

27:57.373 --> 27:58.873
I found today quite taxing.

27:58.875 --> 28:00.324
I thought your pornography
might distract me.

28:00.326 --> 28:02.209
It's not my pornography.

28:02.211 --> 28:05.612
The sex, I'm sorry to say,
is quite mundane.

28:05.614 --> 28:08.382
And even if it wasn't,
the continuity gaffes

28:08.384 --> 28:10.117
make it virtually
unwatchable.

28:10.119 --> 28:12.169
What are you talking about?

28:15.340 --> 28:18.559
Note the clock.

28:18.561 --> 28:19.793
11:20 here.

28:20.762 --> 28:23.264
1:00 there.

28:23.266 --> 28:26.267
11:20 again. And many others.

28:26.269 --> 28:28.769
If I were you, I wouldn't
be upset that a dirty movie

28:28.771 --> 28:30.688
was produced in my home;
I would be upset

28:30.690 --> 28:32.773
that it was produced
so sloppily.

28:35.744 --> 28:38.145
And if you haven't already,
I strongly recommend

28:38.147 --> 28:41.198
that you find yourself
a new spatula.

28:55.380 --> 28:56.830
<i>Watson!</i>

28:57.799 --> 29:00.434
Morning.
What is it?

29:00.436 --> 29:02.503
Captain Gregson just texted,
said there was some sort

29:02.505 --> 29:05.106
of disturbance at Patricia
Ennis's home last night.

29:05.108 --> 29:07.674
It's possible that Howard
Ennis tried to break in.

29:07.676 --> 29:10.010
If he did, he may
have left some clue

29:10.012 --> 29:12.012
as to his whereabouts.

29:12.014 --> 29:15.616
I'm in a hurry. Shall I select
your undergarments as well?

29:18.621 --> 29:20.687
False alarm.

29:20.689 --> 29:22.406
Ennis wasn't
here last night.

29:22.408 --> 29:24.241
Well, someone was.

29:24.243 --> 29:27.244
Couple of Miss Ennis's neighbors
threw these from the street.

29:27.246 --> 29:29.580
I guess they didn't know about
her connection to her brother

29:29.582 --> 29:31.665
until all the news coverage
this week.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.867
Excuse me.

29:33.869 --> 29:37.421
Yes, Chief.

29:37.423 --> 29:39.824
Shall I take a picture
for Kathryn,

29:39.826 --> 29:41.425
show her how her
little tome

29:41.427 --> 29:43.894
affects the Ennis family
to this very day?

29:48.049 --> 29:49.850
Hungry, Watson?

29:49.852 --> 29:51.852
No, it's just this food.

29:51.854 --> 29:53.887
It's exactly the opposite
of what someone

29:53.889 --> 29:56.557
with kidney problems
should be eating.

29:56.559 --> 29:58.843
The chips and the jerky
are high in sodium.

29:58.845 --> 30:00.661
The licorice contains
glycyrrhizin,

30:00.663 --> 30:02.896
which can interfere
with renal function.

30:02.898 --> 30:05.583
She would've known
not to buy these.

30:22.634 --> 30:24.635
What is it?

30:24.637 --> 30:27.638
It's frankincense.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.723
With a hint of carrot seed.

30:35.981 --> 30:37.815
Yeah.

30:37.817 --> 30:40.651
Essential oils,
concentrated liquids

30:40.653 --> 30:43.571
that contain volatile aroma
compounds from plants.

30:43.573 --> 30:45.206
I know what
essential oils are.

30:45.208 --> 30:48.108
Typically, they're used
in aromatherapy.

30:48.110 --> 30:49.776
But you can smell them
on the bottom

30:49.778 --> 30:51.945
of her drinking glass?
Mmm.

30:51.947 --> 30:53.780
Obviously you know
that liquids of this type

30:53.782 --> 30:55.949
are highly toxic when ingested.

30:55.951 --> 30:58.452
Especially
to the renal system.

31:01.724 --> 31:04.558
Those things I said
about your parents...

31:04.560 --> 31:09.763
I believed them when I put them
in your brother's profile.

31:09.765 --> 31:13.067
But when I was
writing the book,

31:13.069 --> 31:16.770
I couldn't prove the abuse.

31:16.772 --> 31:20.407
I didn't want to back down,
so I made up a source.

31:20.409 --> 31:23.410
After your family sued,

31:23.412 --> 31:25.812
I paid one of your neighbors

31:25.814 --> 31:28.249
to say he was the person
I talked to.

31:35.257 --> 31:37.258
I'm sorry.

31:37.260 --> 31:39.993
I'm sorry for
your father.

31:39.995 --> 31:42.263
Your mother.

31:42.265 --> 31:44.265
You.

31:44.267 --> 31:45.999
I even owe

31:46.001 --> 31:48.185
your brother an apology.

31:49.170 --> 31:52.806
Come a little closer.

31:52.808 --> 31:55.643
It's getting hard
for me to talk.

31:55.645 --> 31:58.345
Sure.

32:08.123 --> 32:09.856
Hey.

32:09.858 --> 32:11.492
Captain said
you accompanied Agent Drummond

32:11.494 --> 32:13.494
to speak with Miss Ennis.
Are you with them now?

32:13.496 --> 32:15.129
Well, I'm in the hall.

32:15.131 --> 32:16.964
Miss Ennis said
she wanted some water.

32:16.966 --> 32:18.499
She destroyed her kidneys
deliberately.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.668
She's working with her brother.

32:26.308 --> 32:28.309
You can arrest me now.

32:28.311 --> 32:30.561
It's done.

32:34.926 --> 32:37.032
She came here
to apologize.

32:38.140 --> 32:42.610
As though a simple "I'm sorry"
could make up for any of it.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.094
You're referring
to the allegations she made

32:44.096 --> 32:45.412
about your parents in her book.

32:45.414 --> 32:47.748
I hate that word.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.283
"Allegations."

32:49.285 --> 32:50.601
Call them what they are.

32:50.603 --> 32:52.085
Lies.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.339
Finding out
what Howard did

32:55.341 --> 32:59.360
devastated us.

32:59.362 --> 33:03.314
But Kathryn Drummond's book
is what destroyed us.

33:03.316 --> 33:05.282
All of your correspondence

33:05.284 --> 33:08.118
over the last year
with your brother was monitored.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.605
I imagine he procured
a cell phone from somewhere.

33:11.607 --> 33:15.326
Yeah, he called me a little...
a little over a year ago

33:15.328 --> 33:18.212
on the anniversary
of our dad's death.

33:18.214 --> 33:20.631
He was crying.

33:20.633 --> 33:24.335
He knew
that I was having a hard time.

33:24.337 --> 33:26.670
Is that when he told you
to poison yourself?

33:26.672 --> 33:29.556
I don't know
when he came up with the plan.

33:29.558 --> 33:32.393
I... I-I just know that

33:32.395 --> 33:35.729
it-it just sounded... right,

33:35.731 --> 33:38.065
like it was...
it was supposed to happen.

33:38.067 --> 33:42.319
He would be out there,
humiliating her,

33:42.321 --> 33:45.739
and... I would be in here,

33:45.741 --> 33:48.409
waiting for her.

33:48.411 --> 33:50.027
I spoke to the surgeon
who was operating on her.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.479
He thinks there's a chance
she'll survive.

33:52.481 --> 33:53.831
And as for you--

33:53.833 --> 33:55.249
you're going to jail.

33:55.251 --> 33:57.201
Your kidneys are ruined,
and I'd say

33:57.203 --> 34:00.153
you dropped a notch or two
on the old transplant list.

34:00.155 --> 34:02.322
If I die, I die.

34:02.324 --> 34:05.542
At least I know I died trying
to right a terrible wrong.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.726
<i>He targeted her</i>

34:06.727 --> 34:07.902
'cause he knew
that she was weak.

34:07.903 --> 34:09.876
He knows that he could
bend her to his will.

34:09.877 --> 34:11.068
Captain?

34:12.146 --> 34:14.697
Ennis again.

34:14.699 --> 34:18.234
They just transferred
him from the office.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.437
This is Captain Gregson.

34:21.438 --> 34:24.839
If your men are scrambling
to trace this call,

34:24.333 --> 34:26.500
you can tell them to relax.

34:26.502 --> 34:27.935
I'm calling through a router

34:27.937 --> 34:29.670
that I placed across town
the other day.

34:29.672 --> 34:31.338
'Course you are.

34:31.340 --> 34:33.274
I heard on the news
that Kathryn's still alive.

34:35.110 --> 34:37.945
I wanted you to know
that I think that's a shame.

34:39.447 --> 34:41.581
Means I'm going to have
to keep making my point.

34:43.619 --> 34:46.152
Sit tight.

34:52.460 --> 34:54.911
What's up?

34:54.914 --> 34:56.246
...S-O-P, Columbia University...

34:59.085 --> 35:00.801
Signal for that station's
weak here.

35:00.803 --> 35:02.553
So?

35:02.555 --> 35:04.305
I need to look into something.

35:04.307 --> 35:06.840
I'll call you shortly.

35:39.759 --> 35:42.676
Mr. Ennis, do come in.

35:42.678 --> 35:46.547
You could run,
but I-I do have your handgun.

35:53.138 --> 35:57.141
It's just me. Please.

36:03.865 --> 36:06.483
How'd you find me?

36:06.485 --> 36:08.268
You were tuning your radio...

36:08.270 --> 36:10.454
...when you called
Captain Gregson.

36:10.456 --> 36:14.708
You dialed past a number of
frequencies, but two stood out.

36:14.710 --> 36:16.627
Columbia University's station

36:16.629 --> 36:19.129
has quite a weak signal
strength-- just a few miles--

36:19.131 --> 36:22.800
but it dwarfs the Greek-language
station that you skipped past.

36:22.802 --> 36:24.718
That's a micro-broadcaster,

36:24.720 --> 36:28.472
a tiny little station for
the Greek immigrant community.

36:28.474 --> 36:32.476
Now, very little overlap
between those two stations.

36:32.478 --> 36:35.396
Just a few blocks, actually.

36:35.398 --> 36:38.182
There are a number of empty
buildings within those blocks,

36:38.184 --> 36:40.517
but most of those are homes
that are being remodeled.

36:40.519 --> 36:44.388
This one was seized under
federal asset forfeiture laws,

36:44.390 --> 36:47.241
and, um... ta-da!

36:48.828 --> 36:50.477
So, what do you want?

36:50.479 --> 36:55.032
You and I have both been
profiled by Kathryn Drummond.

36:56.501 --> 36:59.319
You've read "The Deductionist."

36:59.321 --> 37:01.705
You'll recall

37:01.707 --> 37:05.542
she doesn't predict
a very pleasant end for me.

37:05.544 --> 37:07.428
No, no, she doesn't.

37:07.430 --> 37:09.996
She said that you were, um...

37:09.998 --> 37:12.349
destined for self-destruction.

37:12.351 --> 37:15.269
Mmm. The term she used
was self-annihilation.

37:15.271 --> 37:19.523
"A tangle of incandescent talent
and ingrained character flaws

37:19.525 --> 37:21.275
"that can only lead to one end:

37:21.277 --> 37:23.477
self-annihilation."

37:25.030 --> 37:27.281
I think Drummond's good.

37:27.283 --> 37:29.700
Mmm.

37:29.702 --> 37:32.369
She predicted my struggles
with addiction.

37:32.371 --> 37:35.289
And in my less hopeful moments,

37:35.291 --> 37:39.293
I wonder whether she might
be right about my ultimate fate.

37:39.295 --> 37:42.362
She really has a way of getting
in your head, doesn't she?

37:42.364 --> 37:44.581
Do you want to talk
about what she wrote?

37:44.583 --> 37:46.583
No.

37:46.585 --> 37:48.786
I'm not interested
in your words, Howard.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.404
I'm interested in your actions.

37:50.406 --> 37:52.222
I want to see

37:52.224 --> 37:55.926
if either of us could be more
than our profile.

37:55.928 --> 37:59.212
Her assessment of you is...
equally withering.

37:59.214 --> 38:02.766
She believes that you are,
at your core,

38:02.768 --> 38:04.985
a coward.

38:04.987 --> 38:07.654
That regardless of the violence
of your assaults,

38:07.656 --> 38:10.607
you would shrink away
from any confrontation

38:10.609 --> 38:11.909
on equal terms.

38:11.911 --> 38:15.279
So you come here alone

38:15.281 --> 38:17.731
and lay out a gun
and a pair of handcuffs.

38:17.733 --> 38:19.166
Precisely.

38:19.168 --> 38:20.751
An experiment.

38:20.753 --> 38:22.569
Two choices.

38:22.571 --> 38:25.839
Now, if you are, in fact,
a chicken-heart,

38:25.841 --> 38:27.508
you will choose the handcuffs

38:27.510 --> 38:29.743
and surrender,

38:29.745 --> 38:32.346
but if you're willing to face
an opponent face-to-face,

38:32.348 --> 38:33.847
you'll choose the gun.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.134
Personally,

38:37.136 --> 38:38.852
I hope you go for the gun.

38:38.854 --> 38:40.521
If you do,

38:40.523 --> 38:42.189
it'll prove that Drummond
was wrong about you,

38:42.191 --> 38:44.274
and if she was wrong
about you being a coward...

38:44.276 --> 38:46.593
Then maybe she's wrong
about how you'll end up, too.

38:46.595 --> 38:48.595
Maybe you won't die

38:48.597 --> 38:50.814
after turning back to drugs
to dull those senses

38:50.816 --> 38:52.733
that just won't quite shut down.

38:54.602 --> 38:56.487
Is that what
you're terrified of?

38:56.489 --> 38:59.123
That and clowns.

38:59.125 --> 39:01.875
Word of warning.

39:01.877 --> 39:04.495
If you reach for the gun,

39:04.497 --> 39:06.914
I will reach for you.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.952
The choice is yours.

39:25.151 --> 39:27.067
Well done.

39:27.069 --> 39:29.636
Technically only supposed
to strike you in the pate.

39:29.638 --> 39:32.239
But I suppose rules
were made to be broken.

39:44.369 --> 39:47.371
Well, before you punch me
or suspend me,

39:47.373 --> 39:49.256
please keep in mind
that I texted you

39:49.258 --> 39:51.008
the moment I heard Ennis
enter the building.

39:51.010 --> 39:54.344
And the reason you decided
to engage him on your own?

39:54.346 --> 39:56.997
I-I needed to learn something.

39:56.999 --> 39:58.799
And did you?

40:00.718 --> 40:03.103
I can't say, really.

40:03.105 --> 40:05.389
I won't know for years.

40:13.848 --> 40:16.233
Damn it!

40:16.235 --> 40:18.218
Hey, Joan.

40:18.220 --> 40:20.871
Radiator's acting up again?

40:20.873 --> 40:24.124
Never know when Old
Faithful's gonna blow.

40:24.126 --> 40:27.193
Listen, I appreciate
your calling ahead,

40:27.195 --> 40:29.529
but we don't need to be
so formal about this.

40:29.531 --> 40:31.131
It's a funny thing
about that radiator.

40:31.133 --> 40:33.700
In the movie
that Cooper shot, uh,

40:33.702 --> 40:35.552
<i>he did several takes.</i>
<i>In some of the takes,</i>

40:35.554 --> 40:36.753
<i>there's tape wrapped</i>
<i>around the air valve.</i>

40:36.755 --> 40:38.255
<i>In others, there isn't.</i>

40:38.257 --> 40:39.873
It's a basic
continuity error.

40:39.875 --> 40:41.391
I mean, I don't think

40:41.393 --> 40:43.477
Cooper's directing career
is going to go anywhere.

40:43.479 --> 40:45.045
Okay.

40:45.047 --> 40:47.380
But it's almost as if
it started whistling,

40:47.382 --> 40:49.566
and then they called
someone in to fix it.

40:49.568 --> 40:52.385
Someone with
a special shortcut

40:52.387 --> 40:54.821
involving electrical tape.

40:54.823 --> 40:56.890
You were here the whole time,

40:56.892 --> 40:59.225
weren't you, Bruce?

40:59.227 --> 41:01.445
But at-at first,
I-I could not figure out

41:01.447 --> 41:03.947
why you would do
something like that.

41:03.949 --> 41:06.333
And then I remembered that
this place is rent-controlled,

41:07.101 --> 41:09.671
so if I violate my lease,
you can evict me,

41:09.696 --> 41:11.858
and then you can charge
market-value for this place.

41:11.883 --> 41:15.789
I'm hardly the only guy,
with electrical tape.

41:15.952 --> 41:19.080
No, but you know the actors
in that movie they work a lot

41:19.105 --> 41:20.809
and there not hard to track down.

41:21.215 --> 41:23.373
They all confirmed that you
were here the whole time.

41:24.294 --> 41:27.313
You participated in the filming
of an unlicensed production.

41:28.193 --> 41:30.281
That is against the law.

41:30.996 --> 41:32.527
What do you want?

41:32.552 --> 41:34.823
I want you and Cooper
to pay for all of my stuff

41:34.848 --> 41:36.835
to be put in storage until
I find a new place.

41:37.692 --> 41:39.800
I also want 1200 dollars
for that couch.

41:39.825 --> 41:42.066
Because after everything
it's been through in that movie,

41:42.078 --> 41:44.133
it needs to be
taken out back and shot.

41:51.377 --> 41:52.557
How's Kathryn?

41:52.582 --> 41:56.186
Unconscious, yet still
somehow annoying to me.

41:57.297 --> 41:58.656
The doctor says she should
be out and about

41:58.681 --> 42:00.837
practicing her pseudo
science in no time.

42:02.227 --> 42:03.920
Oh, uh, I got you something.

42:06.911 --> 42:09.874
To replace the one
desecrated by a sex act.

42:10.270 --> 42:11.926
Thanks.

42:12.299 --> 42:13.923
It gets better.

42:16.904 --> 42:19.058
I don't understand. Nobody did
anything to my toothbrush

42:19.083 --> 42:20.311
in that movie.

42:20.336 --> 42:22.068
Not in the movie no,
certainly not.

42:23.986 --> 42:26.707
I'm confused, are you saying that
you did something to my toothbrush?

42:30.019 --> 42:32.019
Sherlock?
