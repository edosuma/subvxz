<i>Hollywood Boulevard at night</i>

00:12.405 --> 00:15.866
<i>is the playground of the hip,</i>
<i>young and successful.</i>

00:15.908 --> 00:20.204
<i>It was into this world that</i>
<i>Gob Bluth had finally arrived,</i>

00:20.246 --> 00:22.415
<i>surrounded for</i>
<i>the first time in his life</i>

00:22.457 --> 00:23.958
<i>by a group of admirers</i>

00:23.999 --> 00:28.045
<i>that comprised L.A.'s</i>
<i>latest young elite.</i>

00:28.087 --> 00:32.006
<i>There was Mark, a pop star</i>
<i>who had a level of fame</i>

00:32.049 --> 00:35.595
<i>he could neither appreciate</i>
<i>nor handle.</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:38.097
<i>Trout, a Southern boy who had</i>

00:38.139 --> 00:40.015
<i>a Northern man's</i>
<i>taste in women.</i>

00:40.057 --> 00:44.479
<i>J.B.J., a weekend weatherman,</i>
<i>all-week party boy</i>

00:44.520 --> 00:47.647
<i>and a huge disappointment</i>
<i>to his father.</i>

00:47.689 --> 00:50.485
<i>Chris K,</i>
<i>who was a lot like Trout,</i>

00:50.526 --> 00:52.487
<i>but without the accent.</i>

00:52.528 --> 00:55.114
<i>Oakwood, a studio teacher,</i>

00:55.156 --> 00:57.116
<i>who might have had</i>
<i>his own entourage,</i>

00:57.158 --> 00:58.618
<i>if his part hadn't been cut</i>

00:58.700 --> 01:00.495
<i>from the pilot of</i>
Modern Family.

01:00.536 --> 01:03.998
<i>And, of course, there was</i>
<i>the man they called Getaway.</i>

01:04.039 --> 01:07.001
<i>Gob had come far in the year</i>
<i>since his girlfriend,</i>

01:07.042 --> 01:09.753
<i>was less than an hour</i>
<i>from turning 18.</i>

01:09.795 --> 01:11.755
Let me run the clock down
on this thing.

01:11.797 --> 01:14.467
Why don't you just go change
into something a little less...

01:14.509 --> 01:16.218
unflattering, and... I'll, uh...

01:16.260 --> 01:18.720
<i>And he was getting everyone</i>
<i>in the mood for romance.</i>

01:18.762 --> 01:20.515
Guess I'll take my clothes off.

01:20.556 --> 01:22.975
<i>While Ann</i>
<i>less-unflattered herself up,</i>

01:23.017 --> 01:24.893
<i>Gob had an unexpected visitor--</i>

01:24.935 --> 01:27.813
<i>Ann's ex-boyfriend</i>
<i>George Michael,</i>

01:27.855 --> 01:30.399
<i>who, as it turned out,</i>
<i>hadn't completely let go</i>

01:30.441 --> 01:32.610
<i>of the relationship.</i>

01:32.652 --> 01:33.735
(shrieking)

01:33.777 --> 01:35.404
You're lucky that I'm chasing

01:35.446 --> 01:37.697
after our girlfriend,
or I'd have to flatten you!

01:40.409 --> 01:41.785
Whew! Way to plant, Ann.

01:41.827 --> 01:43.579
You told me George Michael
knew about us.

01:43.621 --> 01:46.999
Well, he does now,
my darling plant.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.000
Ann.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.585
And...

01:49.627 --> 01:51.879
after I dazzle everyone tonight
on the <i>Queen Mary,</i>

01:51.920 --> 01:53.755
my magic career will take off

01:53.797 --> 01:56.592
as surely as there's a mouse
behind your ear.

01:56.634 --> 01:58.802
(Ann screams)

01:58.844 --> 02:01.556
Well, as surely as there's
a mouse behind your ear.

02:01.597 --> 02:03.224
(Ann screams)

02:06.394 --> 02:07.811
- Mouse behind...
- (Ann screams)

02:07.853 --> 02:09.454
Okay, you are like
the only person I know

02:09.479 --> 02:11.273
who doesn't just love magic.

02:11.315 --> 02:14.360
<i>A poll would confirm</i>
<i>she was far from alone.</i>

02:14.402 --> 02:15.903

your least favorite
entertainers are...

02:17.446 --> 02:18.864
magicians.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.158
A close second,
talk show side-kicks.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.743
Hmph!

02:22.784 --> 02:25.954
- (bleep) you, too, America.
- ...'cause I quit.

02:25.996 --> 02:27.582
Well, you have to make things
right with George Michael,

02:27.623 --> 02:29.291
otherwise you don't get
to fourth base.

02:29.333 --> 02:32.294
<i>Of course, Ann's concept</i>
<i>of fourth base...</i>

02:33.754 --> 02:35.797
<i>...was very different</i>
<i>than Gob's.</i>

02:37.341 --> 02:40.302
But you have to promise me
you'll always be faithful.

02:40.344 --> 02:43.180
Faithful?
Of course I can be faithful.

02:43.222 --> 02:44.932
Until tonight, when we're
together, you know...

02:44.973 --> 02:46.517
Oh! Until tonight!

02:46.559 --> 02:48.477
Well, of course I can be
faithful-- don't be stupid.

02:48.519 --> 02:50.271
You think I can't
keep it in my pants

02:50.312 --> 02:52.523
in front of a bunch of
doggy old women and my family?

02:52.565 --> 02:53.815
Don't be stupid.

02:53.857 --> 02:55.484
Who am I gonna hit on, stupid?

02:55.526 --> 02:57.236
My sister? Lindsay?

02:57.278 --> 02:58.862
Don't be stupid.

02:58.904 --> 03:00.573
She's my sister; that's gross.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.700
Now...

03:02.742 --> 03:05.286

03:05.327 --> 03:08.414

03:10.958 --> 03:13.210

NARRATOR: <i>On the day</i>
<i>of the</i> Queen Mary <i>party,</i>

03:28.016 --> 03:29.809
<i>Gob remained faithful to Ann,</i>

03:29.851 --> 03:32.438

03:43.240 --> 03:44.950
But then the <i>Queen</i>
changed course,

03:44.992 --> 03:46.910
heading back to shore
before crashing into the jetty

03:46.952 --> 03:48.454
and leaving most
of its occupants all wet.

03:48.496 --> 03:51.081
I want all of these
on the insurance form, okay?

03:51.123 --> 03:53.501
These are all part of an act
I was going to do.

03:53.542 --> 03:55.711
Two drowned white doves,
for "flowers to doves."

03:55.753 --> 04:00.341
This was a rabbit, for "doves to
rabbit"-- also drowned.

04:00.382 --> 04:01.467
These were mice...

04:01.509 --> 04:03.761
TOBIAS:
For "rabbit to mice."

04:03.803 --> 04:07.598
No, that can't be done.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.016
No, these were
part of a something

04:09.057 --> 04:10.309
I called "Mice-a-laneous."

04:10.351 --> 04:13.729
"Mouse in purse."
"Mouse in drink."

04:13.771 --> 04:16.064
"Here's a mouse, now it's gone."

04:18.065 --> 04:19.860
How'd he do dat?

04:19.901 --> 04:21.362
<i>But it was another man that Gob</i>

04:21.403 --> 04:22.780
<i>needed to make things</i>
<i>right with...</i>

04:22.822 --> 04:24.573
George Michael...

04:24.615 --> 04:26.826
<i>...if he was ever going</i>

04:26.867 --> 04:28.744
Uncle Gob.

04:28.786 --> 04:30.120
Are we good?

04:30.162 --> 04:31.622
(George Michael sighs)

04:31.664 --> 04:33.248
(voice breaking):
No.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.710
No, how could we possibly be?

04:35.751 --> 04:38.629
But... but are we, are we good?

04:38.671 --> 04:41.298
No!
You stole my girlfriend.

04:41.340 --> 04:43.091
That's a tough thing,
and, you know,

04:43.133 --> 04:45.636
sometimes you have to ask
yourself: "Are we good?"

04:45.678 --> 04:47.596
Is it over between you guys?

04:47.638 --> 04:49.264
Oh, no.
But are we good?

04:49.306 --> 04:51.767
I don't know what you want
to hear from me, Uncle Gob.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.853
- I mean, yes, we are good...
- There it is!

04:53.894 --> 04:55.187
There it is!

04:55.229 --> 04:56.856
Ah, from a nephew to his uncle,

04:56.897 --> 04:59.441
and just the "yes,"
the much-vaunted "yes,"

04:59.483 --> 05:00.693
that he gets.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.110
Look at you, full of "yes."

05:02.152 --> 05:04.154
Look at how much "yes"
is in you!

05:04.196 --> 05:06.031
I knew it! I knew I'd get
that "yes" from you.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.783
Look who got a "yes"!
Got my "yes."

05:07.825 --> 05:11.620

Thanks, Mike.

09:18.867 --> 09:21.996
<i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>all the talk of spirituality</i>

09:22.037 --> 09:23.038
<i>that led to this.</i>

09:23.080 --> 09:24.623
(applause)

09:24.665 --> 09:26.374
And welcome to

09:26.416 --> 09:30.420
<i>And As It Is Such, So Also</i>
<i>As Such Is It Unto You.</i>

09:30.462 --> 09:33.048
Excuse me, Father Marsala,
I hate to interrupt,

09:33.090 --> 09:35.592
but I am so excited today.

09:35.634 --> 09:36.969
My lovely Ann...

09:37.011 --> 09:39.304
- Who?
- My daughter.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.598
Oh. I didn't know
you had a daughter.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.391
You've met her several times.

09:43.433 --> 09:44.768
Oh.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.895
She's sitting right next to you.

09:46.937 --> 09:48.229
Oh!

09:48.271 --> 09:49.606
That's why she's there.

09:49.648 --> 09:50.816
I thought you were Hair.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.734
Hair?

09:52.776 --> 09:55.988
No, she's my daughter,
and she's getting married!

09:56.030 --> 09:57.405
To this good man.

09:57.447 --> 09:58.573
(applause)

09:58.615 --> 09:59.908
Well, and as it is such,

09:59.950 --> 10:01.994
so also as such is it
unto you, young man.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.495
You got it.

10:03.537 --> 10:06.832
Unto you, as well...
dear f... heavenly fathers.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.917
MARSALA: Well, we have
a really great show today

10:08.959 --> 10:10.169
surrounding the Scriptures...

10:10.210 --> 10:11.461
GOB:
We have an announcement to make.

10:11.503 --> 10:13.172
I have an announcement to make:

10:13.213 --> 10:18.052
that we would like to televise
our marriage, here on this show.

10:18.093 --> 10:20.804
- (applause)
- My goodness.

10:20.846 --> 10:23.264
Oh, um... we hadn't heard of it.

10:23.306 --> 10:24.432
Did you...?

10:24.474 --> 10:25.684
Well, no, but that's... no...

10:25.726 --> 10:28.062
What an idea. I think...

10:28.103 --> 10:30.189
Well, this show is about
the spirit of inclusion,

10:30.230 --> 10:31.648
- so I would love to say...
- Well, great!

10:31.690 --> 10:33.817
Then I, too,
have an announcement to make!

10:33.859 --> 10:35.318
At our wedding,
I will be performing

10:35.360 --> 10:38.655
one of my
famous magical illusions.

10:38.697 --> 10:40.699
That once your eyes
have beholden it,

10:40.741 --> 10:42.534
you will put no god before me,

10:42.576 --> 10:45.120
because of its spectacularity.

10:47.873 --> 10:52.044
And, of course, I only propose
to do this out of love for...

10:52.086 --> 10:53.336
ANN:
Ann.

10:53.378 --> 10:56.464
And... God.

10:56.506 --> 10:59.051
Love for and God.

10:59.093 --> 11:03.055
Let me pray.
Dearest beloved gods...

11:03.097 --> 11:06.683
<i>Gob was feeling bolder,</i>
<i>which was perhaps why</i>

11:06.725 --> 11:08.267
<i>Michael returned home</i>
<i>to find this.</i>

11:08.309 --> 11:11.021
GOB:
And yea, as if to be arisen

11:11.063 --> 11:16.193
the third or fourth day with all
the magic of Jesus Christ!

11:16.235 --> 11:19.071
MICHAEL: Sorry.
Wasn't on there too good.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.864
- (Gob grunting, groaning)
- You okay?

11:20.906 --> 11:23.366
Yeah, it's just part of my...
illusion for the wedding.

11:23.408 --> 11:24.618
Yeah, what's the illusion?

11:24.659 --> 11:25.827
That you actually
love the bride?

11:25.869 --> 11:29.456
Hey...
that's good patter.

11:29.497 --> 11:32.417
'Cause I need people to root
for the Jesus character.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.586
I don't remember
a biblical passage where Jesus

11:34.628 --> 11:36.046
came out of a boulder--
is it in there?

11:36.088 --> 11:37.256
Oh, no, no, no,
the boulder's my escape plan.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.381
They think I'm somewhere else.

11:38.423 --> 11:39.925
I'm actually in the boulder.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.384
But I didn't come here to talk

11:41.426 --> 11:42.803
- about my magic act, Michael.
- Okay.

11:42.844 --> 11:45.764
I came to ask you
to be my best man...

11:45.806 --> 11:47.766
slash-assistant.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.559
And then we'll walk through
the act later, of course.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.436
- I mean, not now.
- No, we're not going to,

11:51.478 --> 11:53.147
'cause you know,
I'm out of the family.

11:53.188 --> 11:54.397
Did you not get that
when I announced it

11:54.439 --> 11:56.108
over at Mom's place?

11:56.150 --> 11:58.986
I feel like I was out
of the room at that point.

11:59.027 --> 12:00.528
I am done with this family.

12:00.570 --> 12:02.781
I hope you've saved some money
'cause you...

12:02.823 --> 12:04.574
♪ Hello, darkness,
my old friend... ♪

12:04.616 --> 12:06.493
MICHAEL:
<i>Well, the gist of it was:</i>

12:06.534 --> 12:08.036
"You know what?
I'm done with this family.

12:08.078 --> 12:09.788
"I hope you saved your money
'cause you're

12:09.830 --> 12:11.665
going to need
every last dime now."

12:11.706 --> 12:13.250
Maybe you could be a centurion,

12:13.292 --> 12:15.376
kind of standing over
where they think that I'll be.

12:15.418 --> 12:16.920
I'm not going to be in the act.

12:16.962 --> 12:19.131
Might be a great promotion
for the Bluth Company.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.632
No, Bluth Company's done.

12:20.674 --> 12:22.050
I started my own company:
Michael B. Company.

12:22.092 --> 12:23.551
I have a bee company.

12:23.593 --> 12:25.386
You stole my idea?

12:25.428 --> 12:26.721
Uh-uh, I did not steal your...

12:26.763 --> 12:28.515
We sell...
It would take hours.

12:28.556 --> 12:30.600
How's that going, by the way?

12:30.642 --> 12:32.227
Uh, not so good.

12:32.269 --> 12:33.895
I've been keeping the bees
in my apartment.

12:33.937 --> 12:36.190
I was using my magic smoke
on them.

12:36.231 --> 12:37.631
And my bees are dropping
like flies,

12:37.649 --> 12:39.651
and I need them to fly
like bees.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.320
And so I've got them out
at a bee hospital,

12:41.360 --> 12:42.612
which is not cheap,
which is another reason

12:42.654 --> 12:44.072
I need to be a famous magician.

12:44.114 --> 12:46.116
Yeah, well, listen,
you're with my son's ex,

12:46.158 --> 12:47.701
so I can't support the wedding.

12:47.742 --> 12:51.997
What if I don't actually
get married?

12:52.039 --> 12:53.959
I don't think you'd need
a best man, then, right?

12:53.999 --> 12:55.209
No, I guess, at that point,

12:55.250 --> 12:57.460
it'd really be more...
assistant.

12:57.502 --> 12:58.962
Is this an escape act?

12:59.004 --> 13:01.089
- Are you running again?
- What do you want from me?

13:01.131 --> 13:03.842
Marriage is a lot of pressure,
and she's not into it.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.593
Meanwhile, I'm working out
like crazy,

13:05.635 --> 13:07.554
my diet has become insane,

13:07.595 --> 13:11.308
and this Jesus character--
I mean, he was shredded.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.227
Meanwhile, we have sex one time,

13:13.268 --> 13:15.729
and then she's just,
you know, over it.

13:15.770 --> 13:17.022
Lets herself go.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.024
Her stomach's out to here.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.652
You know, your whole life
is an escape act,

13:22.694 --> 13:24.863
and this girl seems
like she really likes you.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.990
Why don't you just try
to work it out

13:27.032 --> 13:29.408
and just stop running...?

13:31.786 --> 13:33.914
Yeah, I know you're
in the boulder.

13:33.955 --> 13:35.957
GOB:
But how'd I get in the boulder?

13:35.999 --> 13:37.876
NARRATOR:
<i>And on the day of the wedding,</i>

13:37.918 --> 13:40.170
<i>even though Gob</i>
<i>didn't take it seriously,</i>

13:40.212 --> 13:43.173
<i>he was a little hurt</i>
<i>to discover</i>

13:43.215 --> 13:45.133
<i>no one else</i>
<i>in his family did, either.</i>

13:45.175 --> 13:47.219
ANN:
<i>I know it's bad luck for you</i>

13:47.261 --> 13:49.637
to see me in my gown
before the wedding.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.766
Well, hopefully I haven't.

13:52.807 --> 13:54.768
You're angry.

13:54.809 --> 13:56.853
Why? Because none of my family
has shown up

13:56.895 --> 13:59.147
and the only person I recognize
out there is Tony Wonder,

13:59.189 --> 14:01.316
who's only shown up
hoping that I'd fail?

14:01.358 --> 14:04.694
I don't know what
your surprise trick is, but...

14:04.736 --> 14:06.445
I know it's going to be great.

14:06.487 --> 14:09.824
And as for your family...
you have a new family now.

14:09.866 --> 14:11.201
(chuckles)

14:12.827 --> 14:15.496
I don't want these.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.499
- Tobias!
- Gob.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.835
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, how could I not?

14:20.877 --> 14:22.837
I'm playing
Roman Centurion Number Two.

14:22.879 --> 14:25.299
- What are you playing?
- I'm the groom.

14:25.340 --> 14:26.716
I didn't know there
was a groom part.

14:26.758 --> 14:28.927
You know, Betty
at <i>And As It Is Such,</i>

14:28.969 --> 14:30.887
<i>So Also As Such</i>
<i>Is It Unto You</i> casting

14:30.929 --> 14:32.431
told me this was all biblical.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.224
Wait, you're not here
for the wedding?

14:34.266 --> 14:37.436
Well, thank you very much
for your vote of confidence.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.354
I'll have you know I've worked
for the Miracle Network

14:39.396 --> 14:40.855
a number of times.

14:40.897 --> 14:42.357
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Coming up next:</i>

14:42.399 --> 14:44.484
<i>Father Marsala's</i>
<i>searing docudrama,</i>

14:44.525 --> 14:46.945
Father Marsala's
John the Baptist.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.114
<i>Then the antiabortion drama,</i>

14:49.156 --> 14:52.659
Embryo Dan: It Would Have Been
a Wonderful Life.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.869
<i>And later,</i>
<i>break out the bagels.</i>

14:54.911 --> 14:57.705
<i>It's time for Father M's</i>
<i>lighthearted comedy,</i>

14:57.747 --> 14:59.833
- A Jew Came to Dinner.
- TOBIAS: <i>I hate to be</i>

14:59.874 --> 15:01.460
<i>the guy who quotes</i>
<i>his own reviews,</i>

15:01.501 --> 15:03.628
but <i>His Word</i> magazine...

15:03.670 --> 15:05.797
called my Jew "pitiful."

15:07.048 --> 15:08.633
NARRATOR:
<i>But soon,</i>

15:08.675 --> 15:10.010
<i>the wedding began.</i>

15:10.051 --> 15:11.970
PASTOR VEAL:
So, it truly is a blessed day.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.930
I believe that we
are all blessed,

15:13.972 --> 15:15.515
uh, to be gathering here

15:15.556 --> 15:18.768
at the Church
of the Holy Eternal Rapture.

15:18.810 --> 15:22.147
Uh, we have almost arrived
at that glorious moment

15:22.189 --> 15:24.858
where we join together
these two very special people,

15:24.899 --> 15:27.568
but first, my almost son-in-law

15:27.610 --> 15:30.613
has something he'd like
to share with all of us,

15:30.655 --> 15:32.615
so, um...

15:32.657 --> 15:34.909
ladies and gentlemen, uh,

15:34.951 --> 15:38.538
please enjoy a magical...

15:38.579 --> 15:40.623
uh, trick.

15:47.005 --> 15:49.590
Thanks for that killer intro.

15:51.801 --> 15:54.304
It's true,
this is a magical trick.

15:54.346 --> 15:57.724
If what Jesus did was a trick.

15:57.765 --> 15:59.642
(crowd gasping)

15:59.684 --> 16:01.228
I say it wasn't.

16:01.269 --> 16:03.355
(laughter, applause)

16:05.606 --> 16:07.150
It was an illusion.

16:07.192 --> 16:08.609
(crowd gasping softly)

16:08.651 --> 16:11.446
TOBIAS:
Ooh, they did not like that one.

16:11.488 --> 16:14.866
I don't take notes from you,
Centurion Number Two.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.285
Just turn this thing around.

16:19.037 --> 16:21.831
I am not the real Jesus.

16:27.379 --> 16:31.466
I am the Amazing Jesus!

16:32.884 --> 16:36.637
No? I thought that that
would be up your... alley.

16:36.679 --> 16:38.515
Yes, the real Jesus

16:38.557 --> 16:40.975
came off the cross
and went into his cave...

16:41.017 --> 16:42.810
a dead man.

16:44.645 --> 16:46.273
NARRATOR:
<i>And Gob's escape boulder</i>

16:46.314 --> 16:47.982
<i>was wheeled up to the trick.</i>

16:48.024 --> 16:50.944
But was he crazy enough
to do it... handcuffed?

16:50.985 --> 16:53.363
Handcuff the King of the Jews!

16:53.405 --> 16:55.698
GOB:
You don't have words here...

16:55.740 --> 16:58.826
Pastor Veal, if you don't mind,
please go up into the cave

16:58.868 --> 17:01.746
and assure everyone
that there's no way to escape:

17:01.788 --> 17:04.082
no trapdoors,
no secret compartments,

17:04.124 --> 17:05.584
no way to get out.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.834
Thank you very...

17:06.876 --> 17:08.336
Pastor Veal, let me remind you

17:08.377 --> 17:11.881
that you are in a church
in front of your daughter,

17:11.923 --> 17:14.092
your congregation, God.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.635
You cannot tell a lie.

17:17.471 --> 17:21.015
Right, nothing
out of the ordinary?

17:22.349 --> 17:24.894
- No, I-I didn't see anything.
- Yes.

17:24.935 --> 17:29.941
Jesus went into the cave,
and he arose three days later.

17:29.983 --> 17:32.360
But I'm not going to lock myself
in the cave

17:32.402 --> 17:34.122
for three days
before this wedding ceremony.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.990
No, no. No, no, no.

17:37.031 --> 17:40.701
I plan on beating his record
by two full weeks!

Into the cave with you!

18:03.308 --> 18:05.602
GOB: No, I said don't underline
the "you" in that.

18:05.644 --> 18:08.021
NARRATOR: <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Gob was not able to open</i>

18:08.062 --> 18:10.731
<i>the secret compartment that</i>
<i>contained the handcuff key.</i>

18:10.773 --> 18:12.733
It's not going to work. Okay,
uh, this isn't going to work.

18:12.775 --> 18:14.319
Let's do...
let's do mouse in drink.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.820
Let's do mouse in drink.
Just get these people

18:15.862 --> 18:17.405
some drinks.
We'll just get a mouse.

18:17.447 --> 18:19.574
No, no, no. No, no, no,
you know not what you do!

18:19.616 --> 18:23.411
<i>But it very clearly said</i>
<i>in the centurions' script</i>

18:23.453 --> 18:26.498
<i>to ignore</i>
<i>the magician's protests,</i>

18:26.540 --> 18:28.583
<i>which meant that,</i>
<i>still handcuffed...</i>

18:28.625 --> 18:30.627
But if my hands are handcuffed,
I'll never...

18:30.669 --> 18:32.712
<i>...Gob was unable</i>
<i>to break his fall</i>

18:32.753 --> 18:34.255
<i>and was therefore</i>
<i>knocked unconscious.</i>

18:34.297 --> 18:36.424
<i>And as the Gob dummy</i>

18:36.466 --> 18:38.009
<i>was sealed inside the cave,</i>

18:38.051 --> 18:41.012
<i>the real Gob's fate</i>
<i>was sealed, as well.</i>

18:45.684 --> 18:49.770
Well, I guess...
we'll wait two weeks...

18:52.190 --> 18:54.817
...and see if he's in there.

18:54.859 --> 18:57.696
Is that okay with you, Ann?

18:57.737 --> 19:00.281
He's not coming back.

19:03.159 --> 19:04.994
NARRATOR: <i>Gob was stuck</i>
<i>inside a fake boulder in</i>

19:05.036 --> 19:06.829
<i>- the parking lot of a church,</i>
- GOB (weakly): Hey, kids.

19:06.871 --> 19:08.748
<i>while inside the church,</i>
<i>the daily routine</i>

19:08.789 --> 19:11.209
<i>- proceeded as usual</i>
- I-18.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.671
<i>and the anticipation grew</i>
<i>to a fevered pitch.</i>-I-18.

19:14.713 --> 19:17.798
11 exciting days, um,

19:17.840 --> 19:20.051
although nothing's
really happened.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.595
Day 11.

19:21.636 --> 19:23.722
Once he gets out,
it's going to be

19:23.763 --> 19:26.391
a beautiful, beautiful wedding.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.560
He's not coming back.

19:28.602 --> 19:32.522
<i>But it was Betty</i>
<i>from</i> And As It Is Such,

19:32.564 --> 19:34.982
So Also As Such Is It Unto You
<i>that would render Gob's</i>

19:35.024 --> 19:37.026
<i>- escape act a disaster.</i>
- You got to get rid of this thing.

19:37.068 --> 19:39.112
- I got Mrs. Murray's trailer here.
- I guess, if he comes back

19:39.153 --> 19:40.780
from the dead,
we could just get a stepladder.

19:40.821 --> 19:42.240
- Guys, this, too.
<i>- And a hoarse,</i>

19:42.282 --> 19:44.451
<i>weakened Gob was unable</i>
<i>to stop them</i>

19:44.492 --> 19:48.496
<i>as the boulder was shipped</i>
<i>to a storage unit in Tustin.</i>

19:48.538 --> 19:50.582
<i>Although a keen eye could see</i>

19:50.624 --> 19:53.501
<i>that Gob was alive</i>
<i>but not well.</i>

19:53.543 --> 19:56.463
<i>And that's why this</i>
<i>particular chair was empty</i>

19:56.504 --> 19:58.798
<i>at the trial of Lucille Bluth.</i>

19:58.839 --> 20:00.508
Well, I can't thank you
all enough for returning...

20:00.550 --> 20:02.302
<i>At the end of two weeks,</i>
<i>the big day</i>

20:02.343 --> 20:03.762
<i>- finally arrived... again.</i>
- So let's count down.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.431
Let's have some fun,
uh, from five, four...

20:06.473 --> 20:10.059
- three, two, one.
- The dead will walk amongst us.

20:10.101 --> 20:13.354
No, he shan't,
for he-eth not here.

20:13.396 --> 20:16.107
- I knew it.
- TOBIAS: Oh, there's a note.

20:16.149 --> 20:20.111
"If I have not yet returned,
I am in the Rapture."

20:20.153 --> 20:24.365
Oh, and then it says,
"Love each other."

20:24.407 --> 20:26.409
MRS. VEAL: What does he think
we've been doing?

20:26.451 --> 20:28.620
I loaned him $1,000.

20:28.662 --> 20:31.539
<i>Gob didn't fare much better</i>
<i>than the bride,</i>

20:31.581 --> 20:34.167
<i>finally being discovered</i>
<i>on an episode</i>

20:34.208 --> 20:35.794
<i>of the auction reality show...</i>

20:37.337 --> 20:39.172
MAN:
Moment of truth, people.

20:40.131 --> 20:42.342
It's a masker.

20:42.383 --> 20:44.260
Jesus, there's a man in there.

20:44.302 --> 20:45.970
(auctioneer coughing,
speaking indistinctly)

20:46.012 --> 20:47.847
Let's get the bidding started
at a hundred dollars.

20:47.888 --> 20:49.307
- (hissing)
- Anybody? -Nope.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.559
He's hissing.

20:54.937 --> 20:56.648
NARRATOR:
<i>After a week in the hospital,</i>

20:56.690 --> 20:59.818
<i>Gob was happy to finally see</i>
<i>a familiar shape.</i>

20:59.859 --> 21:01.027
You humiliated me.

21:01.068 --> 21:02.987
You made a mockery
of my religion

21:03.029 --> 21:04.197
and you ruined our wedding.

21:04.238 --> 21:07.534
Our first fight,
and like all fights,

21:07.575 --> 21:09.910
you're a little right,
I'm a little right.

21:09.952 --> 21:11.496
I sold your cave on Craigslist.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.373
So it was all worth it.

21:13.414 --> 21:16.292
We have money to start
our life together.

21:16.334 --> 21:20.213
Now we have our nest, egg-- Ann.

21:20.254 --> 21:23.675
Now we have our, our nest, Ann.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.678
I'm leaving you, Gob.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.429
I don't love you anymore.

21:28.471 --> 21:31.474
I feel sorry for you, and
you're gonna be alone forever

21:31.516 --> 21:34.060
unless you let the Holy Ghost
inside you.

21:34.101 --> 21:36.229
(laughing):
The, the Holy...

21:38.981 --> 21:41.067
(stammering)

21:45.780 --> 21:48.366
You know what?
I hope you read this.

21:48.408 --> 21:51.952
NARRATOR: <i>And maybe it was</i>
<i>the fact that he had nothing</i>

21:51.994 --> 21:54.414
<i>in his system</i>
<i>but two weeks of candy vines,</i>

21:54.455 --> 21:55.832
<i>but it did get through to him.</i>

21:55.874 --> 21:57.917
Steve.

21:57.958 --> 22:00.044
It's me. Uh, I-I wanted
to let you know

22:00.086 --> 22:05.132
that I am... I'm-I'm ready to...
to... to...

22:05.174 --> 22:09.637
let the son of Gob enfold me.

22:09.679 --> 22:12.306
Have you been to the club And,

22:12.348 --> 22:14.559
owned by Jeremy "Pivan"?

22:14.601 --> 22:15.894
I'm gonna be there tonight
about 8:00.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.604
Maybe you could join me,
I don't...

22:17.645 --> 22:20.064
Obviously it's, it's me,
your fa...

22:20.106 --> 22:22.066
(beep)

22:23.067 --> 22:23.984
Nah, he got it.

22:24.026 --> 22:26.571
Okay.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.281
NARRATOR:
<i>Gob was waiting to meet his son</i>

22:28.322 --> 22:30.241
<i>at a bar and feeling</i>
<i>a little vulnerable.</i>

22:30.283 --> 22:31.950
Lost my wife, lost my career.

22:31.992 --> 22:34.203
When I was in that storage unit
at the bottom of that rock,

22:34.245 --> 22:36.289
it was like I hit...

22:36.330 --> 22:37.749
- Rock bottom?
- No, no, not that.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.751
More like a trending
downward moment

22:39.793 --> 22:42.587
that just-- I don't know.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.924
Maybe I'm being tested like
that guy "Jawb" from the Bible.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.508
- (pronounces correctly): Job.
- Yes?

22:47.550 --> 22:48.509
Job.

22:48.551 --> 22:49.719
Yes, sir.

22:49.761 --> 22:51.721
- Job. - Yeah.
- Look, I, I feel sorry

22:51.763 --> 22:53.180
- for you, Pops.
- Hey, pal,

22:53.222 --> 22:55.057
I'm not that much older
than you, guy.

22:55.099 --> 22:57.143
- (chuckles)
- Nah, I'm just here, I'm looking for my son.

22:57.184 --> 22:59.938
I'm trying to get some cash
out of him, actually.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.356
You, you have another son?

23:02.398 --> 23:03.775
(Steve laughing)

23:03.817 --> 23:05.819
I have a brother?

23:05.860 --> 23:06.903
Oh, man.

23:06.945 --> 23:08.529
Yes, Steve.

23:08.571 --> 23:10.865
Yeah.

23:10.907 --> 23:13.075
- What's his name?
- Dave.

23:13.117 --> 23:14.828
Oh, Dave Holt.

23:14.869 --> 23:16.537
- Yeah, Dave Holt.
- Yes.

23:16.579 --> 23:18.122
NARRATOR: <i>Yes, Gob</i>
<i>had been speaking to his son</i>

23:18.164 --> 23:19.791
<i>for an hour and a half.</i>

23:19.833 --> 23:21.501
- Wait, your mom's name is Eve?
- Yeah.

23:21.542 --> 23:23.878
God, I (bleep) a chick
named Eve once.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.797
Biggest mistake of my life.

23:25.839 --> 23:27.340
NARRATOR:
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>

23:27.381 --> 23:29.342
<i>Gob was inadvertently so warm</i>

23:29.383 --> 23:31.135
<i>to his son that Steve</i>

23:31.177 --> 23:32.929
<i>- offered him a job.</i>
- I don't even really have a job.

23:32.971 --> 23:35.055
Would you want
to come work with me?

23:35.097 --> 23:36.265
I mean, I...

23:36.307 --> 23:37.433
Are you serious?

23:37.475 --> 23:39.310
I mean, I'm in pest control, but

23:39.352 --> 23:41.270
father and son.

23:41.312 --> 23:42.981
What a great team.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.148
It would be a great team.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.274
I mean, I don't care.

23:45.316 --> 23:46.818
Pest control-- I don't know.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.611
As long as I'm not being
a pest to you, right?

23:48.653 --> 23:50.279
- No, never.
- I mean, I'm kidding.

23:50.321 --> 23:52.406
(Gob mumbling)

23:54.617 --> 23:56.911
Where is your place of business?

23:56.953 --> 23:58.287
- 181...
- 181...

23:58.329 --> 24:00.707
- Manville. - Manville.
- Manville.

24:00.748 --> 24:02.040
Manville.

24:02.082 --> 24:05.003
What time do you start
this pest control?

24:05.043 --> 24:06.253
7:00 a.m.

24:06.295 --> 24:08.006
Then I'll be there at 6:45

24:08.046 --> 24:09.465
with two cups of coffee.

24:09.507 --> 24:13.135
Oh, Dad, this is
the greatest day of my life.

24:13.177 --> 24:16.180
No, this is the greatest day
of <i>my</i> life.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.558
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>
<i>it</i> was <i>such a great day...</i>

24:18.599 --> 24:20.560
6:45. -6:45. -<i>... that Gob</i>
<i>decided to stay at the bar...</i>

24:20.601 --> 24:22.937
- 6:45.
<i>- ...and show off a little.</i>

24:22.979 --> 24:26.691
I bet it's been a long time
since you've seen your...

24:28.442 --> 24:30.028
- ...cherry.
- I have lupus.

24:30.068 --> 24:31.905
(spits)
Could have warned a guy.

24:31.946 --> 24:34.114
<i>But showing off did catch</i>
<i>the attention of someone.</i>

24:34.156 --> 24:35.408
That was the real deal, huh?

24:35.449 --> 24:37.075
How about this?

24:37.117 --> 24:39.620
How about you do that cherry
trick for my boy Mark Cherry?

24:39.662 --> 24:41.079
Mark Cherry
the baby-faced singer

24:41.121 --> 24:42.874
or Marc Cherry
the baby-faced showrunner?

24:42.916 --> 24:44.918
Baby-faced singer--
right over there, man.

24:44.959 --> 24:47.336
He has loved magic
ever since he was a kid.

24:47.378 --> 24:50.130
NARRATOR: <i>Which was two years</i>
<i>earlier, when Mark Cherry was</i>

24:50.172 --> 24:52.675

JOHN JR: <i>I found a gentleman</i>
<i>who is about</i>

25:07.273 --> 25:09.943
- to do a magic trick for you.
- No, it's an illusion.

25:09.984 --> 25:12.194
A trick is something
a whore does for...

25:12.236 --> 25:14.321
Do a trick and I'll pay
for your bar tab.

25:14.363 --> 25:15.949
- Who wants a trick?
- ALL: Yeah!

25:15.990 --> 25:18.116
(all cheering)

25:18.158 --> 25:20.202
NARRATOR: <i>Gob had them</i>
<i>in the palm of his hand.</i>

25:20.244 --> 25:22.872
<i>He even got the attention</i>

25:22.914 --> 25:24.624
<i>- of a still out-of-control Rebel Alley...</i>
- Do it again.

25:24.665 --> 25:26.333
- I missed it.
- <i>... who was there doing research</i>

- Fireball!

25:27.961 --> 25:29.670
<i>...she'd soon be required</i>
<i>to do by law.</i>

25:29.712 --> 25:32.715
Fire, fire!

25:32.757 --> 25:35.133
Never yell "fire"
in a crowded place.

25:35.175 --> 25:36.343
It's never funny.

25:36.385 --> 25:38.096
That's always funny.

25:38.136 --> 25:40.014
NARRATOR: <i>And she was intrigued</i>
<i>by this magical man.</i>

25:40.056 --> 25:41.682
- Oh...
- Whoa.

25:41.724 --> 25:43.350
That is a David Spade.

25:43.392 --> 25:46.020
(clears throat)
Check your purse.

25:46.062 --> 25:47.063
(gasping)

25:47.105 --> 25:49.065
- (Gob chuckles)
- Nice.

25:50.357 --> 25:51.484
Oh, man, paparazzo.

25:51.525 --> 25:53.235
Oh, shoot, great.

25:53.277 --> 25:55.237
The last thing I need is to be
seen partying with some tweens.

25:55.279 --> 25:57.239
I'm trying to clean up my act.

25:57.281 --> 25:59.075
Dude, network's gonna flip

25:59.117 --> 26:00.534
if there's another drunk photo
of you.

26:00.576 --> 26:01.786
- I know.
- We got to get you away

26:01.828 --> 26:03.287
- from this place, okay?
- Getting away

26:03.329 --> 26:05.372
is kind of my specialty.

26:05.414 --> 26:08.835
I'll have us out of here
in a flash.

26:08.876 --> 26:10.628
All right.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.505
Let's get out of here while
they still got lighter fluid

26:12.546 --> 26:13.798
- in their eyes.
- Go, baby.

26:15.299 --> 26:16.383
(all laughing)

26:16.425 --> 26:17.844
- Oh, man.
- Oh...

26:17.885 --> 26:20.054
Nice moves, Getaway.

26:20.096 --> 26:21.055
Oh.

26:21.097 --> 26:22.974
Okay.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.934
NARRATOR: <i>Gob had been accepted</i>
<i>into the group,</i>

26:24.976 --> 26:26.811
<i>which was bad news for Cherry's</i>

26:26.853 --> 26:29.063
<i>business manager's son</i>
<i>Josh Abramson.</i>

26:29.105 --> 26:30.648
<i>Gob actually did</i>

26:30.690 --> 26:32.316
<i>end up driving down Manville</i>

26:32.358 --> 26:33.985

- This is it! This is...

26:34.027 --> 26:36.154
I'll be with you in a second,
I'll be right there.

26:36.194 --> 26:38.196
Start without me,
just start without me.

26:38.238 --> 26:40.033
Don't worry!

26:40.074 --> 26:42.535
He's not coming back.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.205
NARRATOR:
<i>Gob was living the dream,</i>

26:47.247 --> 26:50.334
<i>and felt like he was</i>
<i>in the center of the entourage,</i>

26:50.376 --> 26:53.504
<i>even though he was three away</i>
<i>from the center at the closest,</i>

26:53.546 --> 26:56.256
<i>and it was pop star</i>
<i>Mark Cherry's dream.</i>

26:59.093 --> 27:03.181
Hey, I'm with, with the guys.

27:03.221 --> 27:04.473
Keep the limo running, Getaway.

27:06.350 --> 27:07.852

27:28.831 --> 27:30.917

- I won't forget this.

NARRATOR: <i>In an effort to remain</i>

If you shut the partition.
