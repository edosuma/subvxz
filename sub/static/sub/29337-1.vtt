00:01.402 --> 00:04.035
         (bright music)

00:14.849 --> 00:17.516
         (gentle music)

00:23.324 --> 00:25.057
        - [Genevieve] I
       was born in Lyon,

00:25.059 --> 00:27.292
       the third largest
        city in France.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.597
      I was raised in this
       house, in Ronchin,

00:31.599 --> 00:35.501
 a small town where people talk
  about leaving, but never do.

00:37.772 --> 00:41.006
  My family didn't have much,
    but my parents loved us

00:41.008 --> 00:42.941
          and gave us
     everything they could.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.515
   This is Gerard, the cat my
father gave me when I was five.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.020
    This is the last picture
    of my parents together.

00:55.022 --> 00:58.057
       I have spent hours
    looking at this picture,

00:58.059 --> 01:00.259
     trying to find clues.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.361
      Two days after this
       picture was taken

01:02.363 --> 01:05.129
    my father left the house
      and never returned.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.367
      He said nothing, and
       never called again

01:09.870 --> 01:12.504
       Strange how things
      change so suddenly.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.244
       I met Clemont the
    summer after graduation.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.813
         He had dreams.

01:20.815 --> 01:23.148
     He was going to Boston
        to become a chef

01:23.150 --> 01:24.983
    at his uncle restaurant.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.888
    I dreamed of starting a
  family, so I went with him.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.358
    Clemont did many drugs.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.162
    He said this was normal
       in every kitchen.

01:37.164 --> 01:40.532
    When he hit me I asked,
     "Is this normal too?"

01:43.070 --> 01:45.838
     We said goodbye in the
     New England Aquarium.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.057
     What's the difference
   between something I feel,

02:05.059 --> 02:07.159
       and the way things
       are in the world?

02:18.906 --> 02:22.808
   If I believe something is
true, can I trust that feeling?

02:30.284 --> 02:33.152
      And what if it turns
        out to be wrong?

02:33.154 --> 02:35.087
 What do I trust in the future?

02:43.364 --> 02:44.730
     Can you ever be sure?

03:11.592 --> 03:14.326
        (woman sighing)

03:16.864 --> 03:19.765
       (fingers tapping)

03:23.504 --> 03:26.238
        (gate rattling)

03:28.742 --> 03:31.310
         (cows lowing)

03:38.052 --> 03:40.852
        (hands clapping)

03:44.024 --> 03:47.693
         (gentle music)
        (birds chirping)

03:47.695 --> 03:49.094
  - [Sydney] Can you hear me?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.731
  - [Genevieve] Yeah, I wasn't
     sure you'd call today.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.434
  - [Sydney] I call every day.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.839
   You got everything packed?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.774
- [Genevieve] Yeah, I think so.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.811
   - [Sydney] I can't believe

04:05.813 --> 04:08.280
      our weekend together
        is finally here.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.414
         (woman sighs)

04:09.416 --> 04:11.250
     - [Genevieve] I know.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.456
 Do you think it will be weird?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.392
        Like staying in
      the same apartment?

04:28.269 --> 04:30.736
- [Sydney] It just means we get
  to spend more time together.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.079
          - [Reporter]
      (murmuring) highway.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.048
     In the five boroughs,
  westbound 57th Street still

04:43.050 --> 04:44.950
      with one lane closed
     between Seventh Avenue

04:44.952 --> 04:46.418
       and Broadway with
        Carl and Edward.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.954
  With some construction from
    Third Avenue to George,

04:48.956 --> 04:50.088
      George down to FDR,
       Halliburton Drive,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.857
     and to the 80s to 106.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.025
   150s to the GW northbound,

04:53.027 --> 04:54.893
        west side of the
     highway, 125th to 158.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.498
   40 minutes southbound now
   only 15, outbound Lincoln.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.532
  This report is sponsored by.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.602
      (people chattering)

05:12.746 --> 05:16.615
    - I'm Dr. Fried, it's a
 pleasure to meet you finally.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.050
          - Genevieve.

05:18.052 --> 05:18.984
  - [Dr. Fried] Ah, (speaking
     in foreign language)!

05:18.986 --> 05:19.985
          - Oui, Lyon.

05:21.055 --> 05:24.189
       - [Dr. Fried] Ah,
     Lyon. And you live in?

05:24.191 --> 05:25.424
           - Vermont.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.193
     - [Dr. Fried] Vermont,
      primary obstetrician

05:28.195 --> 05:29.628
      based in Bennington.

05:30.464 --> 05:31.363
             - Oui.

05:35.736 --> 05:39.037
     (ultrasound whooshing)

05:43.744 --> 05:46.945
    - [Dr. Fried] All right,
      this is her uterus.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.149
 And this is the amniotic sac.

05:51.151 --> 05:54.186
        And that little
       black bean there.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.922
       (Genevieve sighs)

05:56.924 --> 06:00.092
    That little thing there,
       that is your baby.

06:00.094 --> 06:03.362
     (ultrasound whooshing)

06:05.499 --> 06:07.132
      - [Genevieve] Look.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.571
           I'm sorry.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.373
       (couple laughing)

06:14.375 --> 06:15.273
        - [Lucinda] Hi!

06:17.444 --> 06:18.710
- [Sydney] Let me take your bag.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.911
             - No.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.246
         - [Sydney] No?

06:21.248 --> 06:22.414
            - Ready?

06:22.416 --> 06:23.315
             Yeah?

06:24.885 --> 06:27.686
    We're so glad you could
    join us for the weekend.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.091
         (gentle music)

07:18.238 --> 07:20.872
         (somber music)

07:36.824 --> 07:41.560
    - [Genevieve] September
   14th, day 91 of pregnancy.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.508
    (air mattress whirring)

08:11.892 --> 08:13.725
       (knuckles rapping)

08:13.727 --> 08:15.360
              Hey.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.162
       - This is gonna be
        the baby's room.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.732
 We're gonna make it beautiful.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.069
  Put the crib over here and.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.472
      - I like that book.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.592
         Oops. (laughs)

08:49.162 --> 08:50.061
            Thanks.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.903
    - [Lucinda] You left her
    alone in our apartment?

08:57.905 --> 08:59.204
      - [Sydney] She's 26.

09:00.007 --> 09:00.839
        - [Lucinda] And?

09:02.109 --> 09:04.376
      - Well, I don't know
      what the rules are.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.648
     If we treat her well,
  she'll treat the baby well.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.083
    Make the right choices.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.289
     What do you say, mom?

09:17.291 --> 09:18.390
       (Lucinda screams)

09:18.392 --> 09:19.591
        (Lucinda laughs)

09:19.593 --> 09:22.227
         (gentle music)

09:32.940 --> 09:37.576
   - [Genevieve] What do you
 feel are your best qualities?

09:45.752 --> 09:49.287
 Where, if at all, do you feel
   you would like to improve.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.128
     Do you have a history
         of depression?

10:02.302 --> 10:05.270
    What are somethings that
  make you happy or satisfied?

10:12.646 --> 10:16.114
   If accepted, what kind of
    relationship do you hope

10:16.116 --> 10:18.550
        to have with the
        intended parents

10:18.552 --> 10:21.086
      before, during, and
        after pregnancy?

10:25.158 --> 10:28.293
      - Upstage right that
       oak monster chair

10:28.295 --> 10:29.995
  just darkened a little bit.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.763
        Also can we get
       a working abacus.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.467
       Transition, top of
      the scene one, two,

10:35.469 --> 10:38.103
    just can I get a sharper
       light cue on that?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.839
     Like, just, as opposed
   to some of the cross fade

10:40.841 --> 10:43.241
       that we have, just
    something like snap cue.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.243
             Cool.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.850
       - [Genevieve] How
     come you want a baby?

10:51.852 --> 10:52.917
  - [Sydney] What do you mean?

10:54.421 --> 10:55.387
- [Genevieve] Like do you think

10:55.389 --> 10:57.022
 it's a good world for a baby?

10:57.024 --> 10:57.989
- [Sydney] Pattern of something.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.424
That's, you know, it's too dark.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.092
          It's severe.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.527
      - [Lucinda] For real
 objective, what did you think?

11:02.529 --> 11:04.929
       - For real, here's
       how it's gonna go.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.665
 You're gonna get rave reviews,

11:06.667 --> 11:08.333
       you're gonna sign
       with a big agent,

11:08.335 --> 11:09.668
 line up your Hollywood break,

11:09.670 --> 11:11.936
       and be a household
       name in 24 months.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.639
       - [Sydney] Sounds
       about right to me.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.409
       - Listen, I heard
     about your pregnancy.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.910
        People would be
       really interested

11:18.912 --> 11:21.546
        in your decision
      to use a surrogate.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.114
        - Welcome to our
      bedroom, right, hun?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.516
      - Ya, that's great.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.718
      - How the hell does
    she know, who told her?

11:26.720 --> 11:27.652
- [Sydney] We're in the theater,

11:27.654 --> 11:29.120
  people sit around and talk.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.055
     - [Lucinda] Yeah well
   they shouldn't be talking

11:30.057 --> 11:32.157
    about my fucking uterus.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.672
Today at the clinic, Genevieve.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.508
     - [Sydney] Genevieve.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.043
      - She's less boyish.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.614
  She was like, I don't know,

11:56.616 --> 11:58.450
        like a boy scout
        with croissants.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.287
         Her face looks
     better, it's changed.

12:05.992 --> 12:08.493
     - [Genevieve] I always
  wondered if it was the style

12:08.495 --> 12:11.362
of the actors of the characters.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.630
   - [Lucinda] They're mine,

12:12.632 --> 12:15.266
     they're just filtered
     through the character.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.634
   - [Genevieve] Oh, really?

12:16.636 --> 12:18.169
    - [Lucinda] Be careful.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.038
      All right these are
        for the curtain.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.574
      They never get used.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.081
             Okay.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.017
       - [Genevieve] Your
   apartment looks very nice.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.286
     - Thank you. (laughs)

12:35.288 --> 12:38.623
        Oh Antoine, hi,
       this is Genevieve.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.557
              - Hi
           - Antoine.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.992
      - Nice to meet you.

12:40.994 --> 12:41.860
  - I'm from Italy, (speaking
     in foreign language)?

12:41.862 --> 12:42.761
            - Yeah.
            - Cool.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.565
       - There. (laughs)

12:49.035 --> 12:53.505
    I wear this in Act One.

12:53.507 --> 12:54.672
      - [Genevieve] Whoa.

12:54.674 --> 12:57.342
     - It's my aristocratic
         accoutrement.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.346
            - Nice.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.083
         (gentle music)

13:05.085 --> 13:06.985
      She's 36 years old.

13:10.657 --> 13:14.259
     She has light, auburn
     hair, and green eyes.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.630
    Her friends describe her

13:18.632 --> 13:21.232
      as loyal, ambitious,
       and hard-working.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.405
       - I don't know how
       I'm gonna do this.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.674
       - [Genevieve] She
     likes to be looked at.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.109
    It makes her feel loved.

13:38.118 --> 13:41.920
  She's most passionate about
 pushing herself to the limit,

13:41.922 --> 13:46.090
  being healthy, and the arts
section of "The New York Times".

13:51.231 --> 13:53.264
She has always wanted a family.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.268
      She conceived twice.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.737
        Both pregnancies
     ended in miscarriage.

14:05.278 --> 14:09.681
 Her favorite shows are "House
 of Cards", "Big Little Lies",

14:09.683 --> 14:11.716
and "Inside the Actor's Studio".

14:15.655 --> 14:19.858
  Her best life skills include
    communicating her needs,

14:19.860 --> 14:21.693
       and making people
       feel comfortable.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.565
   - [Lucinda] (groans) Can't
   believe that took so long.

14:29.402 --> 14:33.872
    We open on Saturday so,
   had to make an appearance.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.148
    You know they want to do
    two interviews tomorrow.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.517
  Two, before and after dress.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.723
        It's like don't

14:51.725 --> 14:54.359
     they know the fucking
  pressure I'm under? (groans)

15:16.049 --> 15:18.716
  - [Announcer] We have reason
   to suspect that they are.

15:18.718 --> 15:23.788
       (water trickling)
      (people chattering)

15:24.591 --> 15:26.591
NATO, President Trump will also.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.960
            2% GDP.

15:28.962 --> 15:32.430
      The NATO working out
       the complication.

15:32.432 --> 15:37.502
      (people chattering)
      (Genevieve sighing)

16:09.736 --> 16:10.802
          - Thank you.

16:13.606 --> 16:18.242
   When I was a little girl I
 always leave the curtain open

16:18.244 --> 16:20.011
so I could wake up with the sun.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.851
    My favorite thing was to
   be awake before my parents

16:26.853 --> 16:30.188
 so all right for a few minutes

16:30.190 --> 16:34.359
   I was very free. (laughs)

16:38.164 --> 16:43.001
     But I think now I need
   all the sleep as possible.

16:43.003 --> 16:43.801
          - Goodnight.

16:43.803 --> 16:44.702
           - Sidney.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.643
      Can I just ask you,

16:53.613 --> 16:55.747
   can we hang out tomorrow?

16:58.018 --> 16:58.883
            - Sure.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.574
     - [Lucinda] Everything
      okay with Genevieve?

17:23.576 --> 17:24.474
        - [Sydney] Yeah.

17:25.979 --> 17:26.511
          She's great.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.517
         (gentle music)

17:35.321 --> 17:38.322
       (brakes squeaking)

17:40.193 --> 17:45.263
      (people chattering)
        (birds chirping)

17:49.035 --> 17:54.005
    - [Genevieve] September
   15th, day 92 of pregnancy.

17:57.844 --> 18:01.813
   - [Scale] Hi Lucinda, you
     have lost nine pounds.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.151
       (Genevieve gasps)

18:08.221 --> 18:13.091
        (eggs sizzling)
      (people chattering)

18:17.197 --> 18:19.430
   - [Child] I never saw him.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.299
          No, I think.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.836
        - [Woman] Before
        business opened.

18:24.838 --> 18:27.238
  - [Woman] And that's why he
   didn't go forward with it.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.907
         (gentle music)

18:33.379 --> 18:37.782
   - [Genevieve] He was born
   in Morristown, New Jersey.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.654
       He's the youngest
       of seven children.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.001
     The expression in his
   eyes is warm and serious.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.510
       He tries to enjoy
       every good moment,

19:05.512 --> 19:07.378
       and learn lessons
       from the bad ones.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.020
    He believes each person
   creates their own destiny.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.090
        - [Sydney] Just
       shoot it, come on!

19:19.092 --> 19:19.991
           I got it!

19:21.427 --> 19:22.660
       - [Genevieve] His
        favorite movies

19:22.662 --> 19:24.595
       are "Dirty Harry"
      and "The Graduate".

19:29.802 --> 19:31.602
     - [Man] Hey, come on.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.176
        - [Genevieve] He
     calls me late at night

19:38.178 --> 19:39.644
   and doesn't tell his wife.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.847
       - [Man] That's it.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.015
         - [Man] Nice.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.552
    - [Man] You alright man?

19:47.554 --> 19:49.587
   What, you a little tense?

19:49.589 --> 19:52.089
       - Yeah, you know,
   tomorrow's opening night.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.357
- Oh shit, I thought you forgot.

19:53.359 --> 19:57.528
     You know he's got his
     fiancé in one bedroom,

19:57.530 --> 19:58.796
 he's got his fetus in another,

19:58.798 --> 19:59.931
      he doesn't know his
      ass from his elbow.

19:59.933 --> 20:02.833
         (men groaning)

20:02.835 --> 20:04.302
       - [Man] Wow, man.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.379
             - Boo.
             - Hi.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.482
           Oh no, no.

20:19.586 --> 20:24.155
       100 calories left,
        shower, massage,

20:24.157 --> 20:26.090
      shiatsu 90 minutes,
         shower again.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.759
        Straight uptown.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.728
       - You're stunning.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.562
             - Huh?

20:31.564 --> 20:32.463
       - You're stunning.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.985
         (gentle music)

20:53.987 --> 20:55.620
  Does it get lonely up there?

20:58.358 --> 21:01.359
 - [Genevieve] Yeah, sometimes,
    but I have the animals.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.662
     I feel close to them.

21:08.001 --> 21:10.034
       - [Sydney] Do the
   animals keep you company?

21:12.705 --> 21:17.408
   - [Genevieve] Pretty much,
  except when they don't eat.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.410
    Then they get very mean.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.114
      - [Sydney] Lucinda's
         that way too.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.449
 - [Genevieve] (laughs) Really?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.286
    - [Sydney] Oh yeah, but
  don't tell her I said that.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.188
  - [Genevieve] (laughs) Okay.

21:31.190 --> 21:34.125
    But maybe you should go
    make some food for her.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.995
        - [Sydney] She's
      not around tonight.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.398
     - [Genevieve] Ah okay.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.502
       - [Sydney] If only
       I had some horses

21:44.504 --> 21:45.870
   and cows to hang out with.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.806
         - [Genevieve]
      There's plenty here,

21:48.808 --> 21:50.841
  you can visit them anytime.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.277
        - [Sydney] Yeah?

21:55.014 --> 21:56.147
     Is that an invitation?

21:58.017 --> 22:01.552
  - [Genevieve] Sure, as long
    as you're ready to work.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.587
      - [Sydney] Oh yeah?

22:03.589 --> 22:05.156
      You're going to put
      me to work? (laughs)

22:05.158 --> 22:07.391
 - [Genevieve] Yeah, I'm gonna.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.993
   We need help on the farm.

22:11.064 --> 22:13.931
      - [Sydney] I know my
     way around a pasture.

22:13.933 --> 22:19.003
       (Genevieve laughs)
         (gentle music)

22:44.397 --> 22:47.298
       (water whooshing)

22:54.607 --> 22:56.874
       - [Lucinda] Look,
    honestly I'm distracted.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.276
       Forgive me, I have
         to subject you

22:59.278 --> 23:00.745
        to a kind of a--

23:00.747 --> 23:02.346
     - So hard to bring in.
        - Interrogation

23:02.348 --> 23:05.383
      and I'm embarrassed.
        (phone buzzing)

23:05.385 --> 23:08.185
 And I'm not sure how to begin.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.820
  - [Actor] An interrogation?

23:09.822 --> 23:11.589
      - [Lucinda] Yes, an
       interrogation, but
        innocent enough.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.523
           Let's sit.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.392
      - [Actor] All right.

23:15.361 --> 23:16.160
         - [Lucinda] It
    concerns a young woman.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.828
      - Just a different,

23:17.830 --> 23:20.097
     like a different plate
     of food or something.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.133
    - [Lucinda] I want us to
    talk honestly as friends

23:22.135 --> 23:23.801
       and I'm not gonna
     beat around the bush,

23:23.803 --> 23:25.035
        we'll just have
       this conversation

23:25.037 --> 23:27.071
     and we won't speak of
      it again, all right?

23:27.073 --> 23:30.641
  - [Actor] Okay, it was good,
  I thought it was a good run,

23:30.643 --> 23:31.776
    I don't have many notes.

23:34.046 --> 23:38.115
     Let's see, transition
     top of scene one, two.

23:38.117 --> 23:41.185
      (traffic whooshing)

23:42.688 --> 23:45.756
      (people chattering)

24:01.107 --> 24:02.540
 - What's it like to be married

24:02.542 --> 24:05.910
 or engaged to the playwright?

24:06.979 --> 24:09.113
    Is it a trick question?

24:09.115 --> 24:10.548
       (cameras clicking)

24:10.550 --> 24:12.883
      What's it like to be
   engaged to the playwright,

24:12.885 --> 24:16.353
        is that a trick
     (laughs) sorry, shit.

24:24.363 --> 24:28.966
  I wasn't being professional
      until I was like 16,

24:28.968 --> 24:33.037
 but I was preparing for that.

24:34.407 --> 24:35.806
    But that's something you
   have when you're a child,

24:35.808 --> 24:37.074
        don't you think?

24:37.076 --> 24:38.909
      When you're a child
      you're sort of naive

24:38.911 --> 24:42.847
    and you don't listen to
     people, older people.

24:42.849 --> 24:43.781
  - [Genevieve] What the fuck!

24:43.783 --> 24:45.082
 You're playing games with me.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.285
  Hiding things from Lucinda.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.489
    - It doesn't make sense
     for me to tell Lucinda

24:51.491 --> 24:53.891
  because it's not gonna help.

24:53.893 --> 24:57.328
    She gets so upset about
  these things right she gets.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.262
     - [Genevieve] Come on.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.663
- Freaked out over stupid stuff.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.998
        - [Genevieve] I
     don't feel good here.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.233
     - Okay, you know what?

25:02.235 --> 25:05.002
     Hey, hey, hey, you're
      right, you're right.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.238
    - [Genevieve] Just stop.

25:09.509 --> 25:13.444
   - I promise, I promise, I
    will tell Lucinda, okay?

25:14.814 --> 25:17.448
     I will tell Lucinda, I
  will tell her I called you.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.251
           Come here.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.931
   - [Reporter] It's the same
    bunch losers (murmuring)

25:33.933 --> 25:37.701
these stupid morons (murmuring).

25:37.703 --> 25:39.770
  Because Connecticut doesn't
      have a baseball team

25:39.772 --> 25:43.574
       they can go out to
        see. (murmuring)

25:46.612 --> 25:48.746
       - Hey, open this.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.648
     Is she still sleeping?

25:50.650 --> 25:55.452
   - [Reporter] It's fuckin'
Connecticut, I mean, I haven't.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.429
           - My keys.
         - You got 'em?

26:05.431 --> 26:08.332
 - [Lucinda] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.770
        (door squeaking)

26:16.576 --> 26:19.209
         (gentle music)

26:21.380 --> 26:22.880
 - [Genevieve] September 16th,

26:24.417 --> 26:26.884
      day 93 of pregnancy.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.554
     - [Reporter] Let's get
(drowned out by doors thudding)

26:30.556 --> 26:33.991
   here, why are you beating
    around the bush, Jerry?

26:33.993 --> 26:36.560
 Why, what do you mean (drowned
     out by door thudding).

26:36.562 --> 26:39.930
     - {Jerry] There wasn't
     and I really recommend

26:39.932 --> 26:42.433
that you don't push me too much.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.134
        - [Reporter] Oh
      come on. (murmuring)

26:44.136 --> 26:46.537
        (crowd cheering)

26:46.539 --> 26:50.207
         (gentle music)
        (birds chirping)

26:50.209 --> 26:53.777
   - [Genevieve] The average
  surrogate in the U.S. is 28,

26:53.779 --> 26:58.015
     married, employed, and
  living in the middle class.

27:02.054 --> 27:07.124
     On average, surrogates
  make $42,000 per pregnancy,

27:07.793 --> 27:10.160
       or $1.75 per hour.

27:15.501 --> 27:17.801
       The total cost to
    intended parents can be

27:17.803 --> 27:21.572
      as high as $180,000.

27:26.445 --> 27:30.614
     In America, there are
    over 2,500 children born

27:30.616 --> 27:32.616
    to surrogates each year.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.119
  - [Man] Going all day long.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.889
  And these people would come
 in and didn't I just say that,

27:38.891 --> 27:40.324
   they were very conceited.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.293
 - Well it was hard, you know,

27:44.664 --> 27:49.600
 I came with very little money
  and even fewer connections,

27:52.471 --> 27:55.539
     and I did do all those
   day job things, literally,

27:55.541 --> 27:58.709
   I temped, I waited tables.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.711
      I was once hired to
     be a toy demonstrator

28:00.713 --> 28:02.780
      at F.A.O. Schwartz.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.281
      (audience laughing)

28:04.283 --> 28:06.383
   And I was lucky enough to
    find a group of friends

28:06.385 --> 28:08.085
  who were equally passionate,

28:08.087 --> 28:13.157
     and it's that real mix

28:14.226 --> 28:18.295
       of feelings I long
         for sometimes,

28:19.665 --> 28:21.532
     there was an innocence
       and a beauty to it

28:21.534 --> 28:23.300
   that I don't have anymore.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.870
      But, I also like how
      my life turned out,

28:26.872 --> 28:30.874
     so, I don't want to go
  backwards but I fell in love

28:30.876 --> 28:34.178
   with the city when I was a
 teenager when I came to visit,

28:34.180 --> 28:36.747
       and I told myself
     I'm coming back here,

28:36.749 --> 28:41.452
      so it was a lifelong
   process, and here we are.

28:45.424 --> 28:46.590
      - [Audience Member]
      I wanted to ask you

28:46.592 --> 28:48.392
    about the very overt...

28:51.497 --> 28:54.665
      (people chattering)

28:57.436 --> 28:59.770
 - [Sydney] What are you doing?

28:59.772 --> 29:01.438
       - [Genevieve] Just
       laying in the bed.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.008
       - [Sydney] Are you
        feeling alright?

29:05.010 --> 29:07.311
     - [Genevieve] Yeah, I
    feel perfect right now.

29:08.481 --> 29:09.546
      - [Sydney] Oh, good.

29:11.450 --> 29:16.520
 No queasiness, you're finally
   getting a peaceful night?

29:17.423 --> 29:18.422
      - [Genevieve] Yeah.

29:20.793 --> 29:23.026
       My body feels like
         it's changing.

29:24.830 --> 29:25.963
    - [Sydney] Well, I guess

29:25.965 --> 29:27.731
         that means the
     hormones are working.

29:29.835 --> 29:34.404
     - [Genevieve] Yeah, my
  breasts are getting so big.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.110
     - [Sydney] Is that so?

29:44.550 --> 29:45.449
            - Yeah.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.888
      I'm glad you called.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.389
   I was thinking about you.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.695
       (Genevieve sighs)

30:15.414 --> 30:18.248
        (door squeaking)

30:34.433 --> 30:37.434
       (knuckles rapping)

30:46.512 --> 30:48.011
      (laughs) I feel it.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.347
 I feel it, the baby, for real.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.618
           - You do?
   - Just now, I don't know.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.953
      - [Sydney] Just now?

30:55.955 --> 30:58.222
             - Yeah
        - It's too soon.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.623
   - No, I mean I don't know.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.061
       Touch, maybe he's.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.068
      - [Sydney] Nothing.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.502
     - Yeah, wait a moment.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.411
         Wait a little.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.891
         (gentle music)

31:50.643 --> 31:53.277
         (both moaning)

31:58.984 --> 32:01.385
 - [Sydney] What are we doing?

32:02.354 --> 32:03.253
             Wait.

32:25.477 --> 32:28.145
         (gentle music)

32:30.449 --> 32:32.249
     No, we can't do this.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.728
       (Genevieve sighs)

32:51.937 --> 32:54.938
         (gentle music)

32:54.940 --> 32:58.041
      (Lucinda whispering)

33:29.541 --> 33:32.609
      (traffic whooshing)

33:34.146 --> 33:37.214
      (people chattering)

33:42.388 --> 33:45.222
        (sirens wailing)

33:50.763 --> 33:53.830
      (people chattering)

34:46.851 --> 34:51.922
       (brakes squeaking)
      (people chattering)

34:56.228 --> 34:58.962
        (horns tooting)

35:01.533 --> 35:04.601
      (cigarette hissing)

35:06.772 --> 35:09.906
      (people chattering)

35:19.618 --> 35:21.818
  - [Lucinda] Do you like it?

35:21.820 --> 35:25.088
  - [Makeup Artist] You did a
 spectacular job, it's perfect.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.323
     - [Lucinda] Thank you.

35:26.325 --> 35:27.390
       - [Makeup Artist]
        And so are you.

35:27.392 --> 35:28.625
             - No.
       - You're all set.

35:29.595 --> 35:30.594
          - Thank you.
        (lips smacking)

35:30.596 --> 35:32.229
- [Makeup Artist] Happy opening.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.465
          - Genevieve.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.301
         (gentle music)

35:38.303 --> 35:39.202
              Aw.

35:48.413 --> 35:49.312
            My baby.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.316
       Really, thank you.

35:55.053 --> 35:58.121
      (people chattering)

35:58.891 --> 36:01.892
      (machines whirring)

36:14.873 --> 36:18.542
      (people chattering)

36:18.544 --> 36:23.146
     - They watch the play
    through the window, and,

36:25.884 --> 36:30.320
 Jake, He's the lighting board.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.906
       - [Genevieve] So,
       what happens now?

36:53.645 --> 36:56.413
    - [Sydney] I don't know.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.582
   I have to think about it.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.586
         (gentle music)

37:02.588 --> 37:04.654
    I just can't believe it.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.457
- [Lucinda] I didn't want this.

37:07.459 --> 37:09.192
       - [Actor] I didn't
       want this either!

37:09.194 --> 37:11.094
        - [Lucinda] You
       didn't want this?

37:11.096 --> 37:13.196
     You didn't want this!

37:13.198 --> 37:15.832
    If you didn't want this!

37:15.834 --> 37:18.668
    If I to you am blasphemy

37:23.909 --> 37:27.210
 let martyr be the mask I wear.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.549
       (lights clicking)

37:34.987 --> 37:38.221
     (audience applauding)

37:42.494 --> 37:45.662
      (audience cheering)

37:48.433 --> 37:53.503
         (upbeat music)
      (people chattering)

38:21.500 --> 38:26.569
        ¶ Oh, so long ¶

38:30.342 --> 38:32.976
        ¶ Been so long ¶

38:53.365 --> 38:56.032
        ¶ So, so, long ¶

38:59.738 --> 39:02.339
         (somber music)

39:33.405 --> 39:34.571
      - It was a pleasure,

39:34.573 --> 39:35.839
         I enjoyed the
      performance greatly.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.607
    - [Lucinda] Thank you so
    much, thank you so much.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.642
  - I can't even tell you how
    emotional it made myself

39:39.644 --> 39:41.144
   and so many other people.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.412
        - You know that.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.747
     I think the next show
     is gonna be a musical.

39:43.749 --> 39:44.681
        - [Sydney] Yeah,
     I'll write the music.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.483
 - And I'm not gonna direct it.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.351
 - Only if you choreograph it.
       - I'm gonna star.

39:48.353 --> 39:50.487
      - My daughter, she's
        in drama school.

39:50.489 --> 39:53.690
       19 years old, got
       any tips for her?

39:53.692 --> 39:55.692
         Any pointers,
      anything like that?

39:57.496 --> 40:00.630
      (people chattering)

40:06.304 --> 40:08.071
     - [Sydney] Please tell
       me that was water.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.774
     - Okay that was water.

40:10.776 --> 40:13.510
         (bright music)

40:20.285 --> 40:22.085
         (gentle music)

40:22.087 --> 40:24.320
  Genevieve, what's going on?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.025
        What's going on?

40:30.095 --> 40:31.327
        - [Genevieve] We
      need to discuss it.

40:31.329 --> 40:32.462
    - Okay, I'm right here,
     let's discuss, what--

40:32.464 --> 40:33.363

40:38.870 --> 40:40.503
           - Sidney.
           - I don't.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.772
          Please, hey.

40:43.909 --> 40:47.010
     - You're like Humphrey
      Bogart, Gary Cooper.

40:47.012 --> 40:47.877
    - Yeah, I'm Gary Cooper.
             - Hey.

40:50.682 --> 40:54.050
     - You need to go back
    to the apartment, okay?

40:54.052 --> 40:54.918
             - No.

40:54.920 --> 40:55.885
        - Yes, come on.
             - No.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.153
   - I'm getting you a taxi.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.322
        - I need to talk
       to you right now.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.623
             Where?

41:00.625 --> 41:02.091
           - Outside.
             - No.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.626
      - Let's go outside,
      me and you, outside.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.161
  - I don't wanna go outside.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.797
         (upbeat music)

41:14.172 --> 41:15.071
            Sidney!

41:15.941 --> 41:17.440
         - What is it?

41:17.442 --> 41:19.976
  Okay, talk to me, goddammit,
   tell me what is going on.

41:23.381 --> 41:24.514
             Speak.

41:24.516 --> 41:25.882
       - All right, I am.

41:27.452 --> 41:29.052
     I'm going to tell you.
            - Okay.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.790
       - Six more months.

41:33.792 --> 41:38.862
  No, I can't feel that inside
    me, everything, like...

41:44.936 --> 41:46.469
 It's too much, it's too much.

41:46.471 --> 41:48.905
   - What we did today, what
    we did can not interfere

41:48.907 --> 41:51.074
   with your responsibility.

41:51.076 --> 41:53.276
   - Finished, I'm finished.

41:54.546 --> 41:55.778
    - You're under contract,

41:55.780 --> 41:57.046
      you signed a fucking
        contract, okay?

41:57.048 --> 41:58.982
     - [Genevieve] I don't
    fucking care about that.

41:58.984 --> 42:00.116
     - The police will take
    you and they'll put you

42:00.118 --> 42:01.384
          in a cell--
    - You got so many women.

42:01.386 --> 42:02.318
      - They'll put you--
      - Pick another one!

42:02.320 --> 42:03.419
   They'll put you in a cell

42:03.421 --> 42:04.087
        and they will--
       - Leave me alone.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.488
            Please!

42:05.490 --> 42:06.456
 - And they will induce labor--

42:06.458 --> 42:07.991
          - Fuck you.
         - With a pill,

42:07.993 --> 42:09.125
  that's what they're going to
  do to you, do you want that?

42:09.127 --> 42:10.560
      - I have the power.
          - No, stop.

42:10.562 --> 42:11.694
      - It's my emotion--
   - Stop it, okay, I don't.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.329
     - And my body says no.
         - Relax, stop!

42:13.331 --> 42:15.565
          - Fuck you!
       - Stop touching me

42:15.567 --> 42:16.933
  and listen to me god dammit.
          - I decide!

42:16.935 --> 42:17.767
              No!
             - Yes!

42:17.769 --> 42:19.636
    - I don't fucking care.

42:19.638 --> 42:23.306
   Come on, I choose it if I
   fucking say no, I say no,

42:23.308 --> 42:25.208
        if I don't want,
       I don't want that.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.543
           That's it.

42:26.545 --> 42:29.579
       I don't want that,
         I cannot carry

42:29.581 --> 42:33.016
 that fucking child inside me.

42:33.018 --> 42:34.217
         (door banging)

42:34.219 --> 42:37.020
- Talk to me, talk to me, okay?

42:37.022 --> 42:37.921
          Talk to me.

42:40.825 --> 42:44.694
       - Sidney, I don't
       have anybody here.

42:44.696 --> 42:46.863
   I called my friend Pierre.

42:46.865 --> 42:48.565
    - I don't care, I don't
       care about Pierre.

42:48.567 --> 42:51.601
         - I told him,

42:53.572 --> 42:55.338
      I'm doing that thing

42:55.340 --> 42:59.842
    to be a surrogate but I
     think I love that man.

43:02.247 --> 43:03.146
            - What?

43:05.450 --> 43:10.086
   - Today, we give the baby
  the feeling of love, Sidney.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.189
            - Love?

43:15.493 --> 43:16.326
          You love me?

43:16.328 --> 43:17.260
        Do you love me?

43:19.965 --> 43:21.331
         Then how could
       you kill my child.

43:21.333 --> 43:22.865
         (door banging)

43:22.867 --> 43:25.501
      - Because it's that
       or myself, Sidney,

43:25.503 --> 43:26.769
   what do you want from me.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.005
   What do you want, tell me!

43:34.279 --> 43:37.113
        (Sidney gasping)

43:45.390 --> 43:46.956
       I'm sorry, Sidney.

44:02.841 --> 44:03.906
          - Genevieve,

44:06.878 --> 44:09.112
   Genevieve, do you mean it,

44:11.516 --> 44:13.716
   when you say you love me?

44:13.718 --> 44:15.351
        Do you mean it,
       is that the truth?

44:16.755 --> 44:19.389
         (gentle music)

44:19.391 --> 44:20.356
       - [Genevieve] Yes.

44:22.560 --> 44:26.295
       - I need to know.

44:26.297 --> 44:29.232
    Because I love you too.

44:29.234 --> 44:30.166
          - You don't.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.367
          - Yes, I do.
        - No, you don't.

44:31.369 --> 44:32.735
      - I do, look at me,
        look at my face.

44:32.737 --> 44:34.070
  Why else would I come here?

44:34.072 --> 44:35.171
   - I don't wanna kiss you.

44:38.910 --> 44:41.044
   - Okay, you don't have to.

44:42.714 --> 44:45.048
  You sure you don't want to?

45:03.968 --> 45:07.136
       You wouldn't hurt
      my baby, would you?

45:07.939 --> 45:09.105
     Tell me you wouldn't.

45:11.710 --> 45:13.342
     It's practically ours.

45:17.982 --> 45:20.983
       Tomorrow you don't
     go, you you don't go,

45:22.020 --> 45:23.186
        you stay and I,

45:24.289 --> 45:25.788
         and I will get
       you a hotel, okay?

45:27.425 --> 45:28.458
         A nice hotel.

45:30.695 --> 45:33.463
     And we start tomorrow,
       we start. (sighs)

45:53.384 --> 45:58.187
  - The way you touch me shows
  me that you know me, Sidney.

46:13.571 --> 46:14.737
         I'm so tired.

46:19.344 --> 46:21.410
         I'm so tired.
            - Okay.

46:21.412 --> 46:22.678
     (audience applauding)

46:22.680 --> 46:24.046
   - Antoine, where are you?

46:24.048 --> 46:27.717
     Ugh, lovely work, yes,
      you too, wonderful.

46:27.719 --> 46:30.920
 And of course, Lucinda Greene.

46:30.922 --> 46:33.990
      (audience cheering)

46:36.361 --> 46:38.060
      To have you staying
     with us for this run,

46:38.062 --> 46:40.029
      it means the world,
         so thank you.

46:40.031 --> 46:41.998
       Thank you for your
        beautiful work.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.866
      And to our esteemed
     director, where is he?

46:43.868 --> 46:46.269
 Ronnie Savage, what can I say?

46:46.271 --> 46:47.537
  You weren't our first choice

46:47.539 --> 46:50.439
       but we're so happy
      to have you with us.

46:50.441 --> 46:52.308
    - [Ronnie] That's okay.

46:52.310 --> 46:57.380
         (gentle music)
  (people chattering faintly)

47:23.708 --> 47:26.008
     (ultrasound whooshing)

47:26.010 --> 47:27.643
- [Lucinda] Can you believe it?

47:28.580 --> 47:30.546
  We're finally having a baby.

47:40.859 --> 47:43.593
        (Lucinda sighs)

47:46.764 --> 47:49.699
       Hey, why don't you
     join me in the shower?

47:49.701 --> 47:52.368
         (gentle music)

47:52.370 --> 47:54.237
       - [Sydney] Do you
      want your own kids?

47:54.239 --> 47:58.708
       - [Genevieve] Yes,
    when the time is right.

48:01.613 --> 48:03.045
 - [Sydney] How will you know?

48:05.683 --> 48:08.584
     - [Genevieve] At first
     I have to be in love,

48:08.586 --> 48:10.186
      then I'll be ready.

48:13.024 --> 48:17.994
 - [Sydney] I mean, what about
  work or money, commitments?

48:21.366 --> 48:24.100
  - [Genevieve] I don't think
   too much of those things.

48:25.470 --> 48:27.336
   - [Sydney] You're more of
    a free spirit than I am.

48:29.774 --> 48:32.341
      - [Genevieve] I just
    think if you have love,

48:32.343 --> 48:34.143
  everything else will follow.

48:36.514 --> 48:38.948
   - [Announcer] (murmuring)
    Rain yesterday afternoon

48:38.950 --> 48:40.416
         now well off.

48:40.418 --> 48:44.153
     (murmuring) Rain till
   late in the day tomorrow.

48:44.155 --> 48:46.155
        Cloud cover will
       stay till Monday.

48:46.157 --> 48:47.523
        (door knocking)

48:47.525 --> 48:49.158
          Looking at a
      beautiful day today.

48:49.160 --> 48:53.696
      Winds still be real
     cool tonight, low 72,
       very cold dry air.

48:53.698 --> 48:55.197
      - [Lucinda] Morning.

48:55.199 --> 48:57.633
 - [Announcer] Well off to our
  (murmuring) Hurricane Erin,

48:57.635 --> 48:59.802
  up to the north (murmuring).

48:59.804 --> 49:01.037
           Tonight--

49:01.039 --> 49:02.004
        - [Lucinda] I'm
       sorry to wake you.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.674
   I just wanted to make sure

49:04.676 --> 49:07.209
       that you could eat
   something before the bus.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.279
  - [Announcer] It's gorgeous
  Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

49:10.281 --> 49:14.417
     Low 70 and the average
    high is 82. (murmuring)

49:14.419 --> 49:16.152
      - [Lucinda] Shadows
         of this world,

49:16.154 --> 49:20.723
     hers is a performance
    that cuts and nourishes.

49:20.725 --> 49:21.657
         - [Announcer]
    Northwest wind is now--

49:21.659 --> 49:24.894
- And without fail, elicits awe.

49:24.896 --> 49:26.062
         - [Announcer]
      Today and tomorrow,

49:26.064 --> 49:27.997
    that means the humidity
       level today is 72.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.498
       (Lucinda squeals)

49:29.500 --> 49:33.569
    - [Genevieve] September
   17th, day 94 of pregnancy.

49:34.639 --> 49:38.007
        (Lucinda sighs)

49:38.009 --> 49:40.743
         (gentle music)

49:43.014 --> 49:43.946
      - It's unbelievable.
           - Mm-hmm.

49:43.948 --> 49:45.181
  - You really went overboard.

49:45.183 --> 49:48.351
       - Well, you know,
      four mouths to feed.

49:51.556 --> 49:52.955
      So you go home and,

49:54.525 --> 49:55.424
         and then what?

50:02.900 --> 50:03.799
              - I,

50:05.269 --> 50:07.269
       I guess everything
       go back to normal.

50:08.673 --> 50:09.605
             - Ooh!

50:09.607 --> 50:10.606
           Requests?

50:12.043 --> 50:13.509
      - Whatever you like.
             - Yep?

50:19.650 --> 50:20.783
           - Sidney.

50:23.654 --> 50:24.553
            Sidney.

50:26.891 --> 50:28.157
              Oui.

50:28.159 --> 50:30.793
         (gentle music)

50:32.897 --> 50:35.965
      (traffic whooshing)

50:42.940 --> 50:46.042
      (people chattering)

50:50.281 --> 50:52.148
  - Oh, let's take a picture!

50:52.150 --> 50:54.116
      No, I left my phone.

50:54.118 --> 50:57.520
      I couldn't read all
    those, congratulations.

50:57.522 --> 50:58.387
           Thank you.

51:00.858 --> 51:02.858
       Excuse me, do you
     mind taking a picture?

51:02.860 --> 51:04.326
        - What happened?

51:04.328 --> 51:05.761
    - [Sydney] I'm sorry we
  didn't get a chance to talk.

51:05.763 --> 51:07.229
          - Thank you.

51:07.231 --> 51:08.030
  - [Sydney] Gimme a call when
    you get back to Vermont.

51:13.704 --> 51:14.603
         - A full body.

51:18.309 --> 51:20.543
       (Lucinda laughing)

51:20.545 --> 51:22.078
       (camera clicking)
           Thank you.

51:25.316 --> 51:26.682
      Oh you look pretty.

51:29.987 --> 51:31.153
     - All right thank you.

51:32.356 --> 51:33.255
              Bye.

51:33.257 --> 51:34.490
        - [Lucinda] Bye.

51:34.492 --> 51:35.658
         Get home safe.

51:38.696 --> 51:39.762
             - Bye.
             - Bye.

51:52.443 --> 51:55.144
         (gentle music)

52:01.552 --> 52:03.619
    - [Genevieve] Surrogate
   mothers still have rights

52:03.621 --> 52:07.957
       to the child until
       it is surrendered.

52:09.494 --> 52:12.194
     Even with a surrogacy
      agreement in place.

52:17.702 --> 52:20.803
     Screening of potential
       surrogates ensures

52:20.805 --> 52:23.572
     that there will be no
    emotional complications

52:23.574 --> 52:25.441
   in the surrogacy process.

52:31.682 --> 52:35.684
     98% of women who apply
      to become surrogates

52:35.686 --> 52:38.220
         in the United
      States are rejected

52:38.222 --> 52:40.189
  by screening organizations.

52:48.332 --> 52:50.065
   Those chosen as surrogates

52:50.067 --> 52:52.968
   almost never have trouble
      relinquishing rights

52:52.970 --> 52:53.802
         to the child.

52:55.206 --> 52:57.173
   But there are exceptions.

53:05.783 --> 53:08.517
        (phone buzzing)

53:16.661 --> 53:17.560
             - Hey.

53:19.697 --> 53:20.563
         Where are you?

53:24.135 --> 53:29.205
      (traffic whooshing)
        (birds chirping)

53:48.893 --> 53:50.025
              Hey.

53:50.027 --> 53:50.926
             - Hey.

53:55.266 --> 53:57.166
     - [Sydney] Why aren't
        you on the bus?

53:57.168 --> 54:00.803
- Why are we here in this place?

54:05.376 --> 54:07.109
          - Genevieve.
            - What?

54:12.483 --> 54:14.483
      - I spoke too soon.

54:14.484 --> 54:16.484
    My feelings for you are
    real, absolutely, 100%.

54:18.623 --> 54:20.489
   But I can't leave Lucinda.

54:22.860 --> 54:24.393
      It would never work.

54:24.395 --> 54:27.663
      I mean, you know how
    she is, she's delicate.

54:27.665 --> 54:28.931
    C'mon, it wouldn't last.

54:29.967 --> 54:31.367
    I could be your father.

54:37.808 --> 54:38.774
       Do you understand?

54:40.378 --> 54:41.777
      I mean do you agree?

54:46.317 --> 54:47.216
          - Yes, sure.

54:50.021 --> 54:50.886
            - Yeah?

54:52.256 --> 54:53.822
            Really?

54:53.824 --> 54:57.860
   Because I need to know it.

54:57.862 --> 54:59.328
      That you understand.

54:59.330 --> 55:01.096
     I mean I need to know
   that you're okay with it.

55:05.069 --> 55:06.468
    Are you okay with this?

55:11.375 --> 55:12.274
           Genevieve?

55:14.278 --> 55:15.744
      Say something, okay?

55:16.580 --> 55:18.247
I need to know that you're okay.

55:27.024 --> 55:27.873
           Genevieve?

55:27.874 --> 55:28.723
        - [Genevieve] I
     can't have your baby.

55:30.661 --> 55:35.731
         (gentle music)
      (people chattering)

55:40.037 --> 55:41.937
     - [Man] Here they are.

55:43.441 --> 55:44.973
 - [Genevieve] What is a life?

55:47.111 --> 55:49.211
      What makes a person
         who they are?

55:49.213 --> 55:50.412
             - Hey!

55:50.414 --> 55:52.448
        Hey, hey, fuck.

55:52.450 --> 55:54.249
     - [Genevieve] Is there
      any way to be free?

55:54.251 --> 55:56.785
    - [Sydney] I'm confused,
     I don't know, I wanna.

55:56.787 --> 55:58.754
       Listen, I'm gonna
        get you a hotel.

55:58.756 --> 56:01.490
  I'll meet you in the hotel,
     we'll figure this out.

56:01.492 --> 56:02.391
         It'll be nice.

56:03.361 --> 56:05.661
  I'll tell Lucinda, come on.

56:08.199 --> 56:10.833
         (somber music)

56:15.439 --> 56:17.906
     - Did you see my neck
       when I kissed him?

56:18.709 --> 56:20.542
 It cranked around like an owl.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.611
     It was crazy awkward.

56:22.613 --> 56:24.546
        God, it must've
       looked ridiculous.

56:24.548 --> 56:26.148
      - No, that is real.

56:26.150 --> 56:28.984
 That's real and I wanna know,

56:28.986 --> 56:31.153
  honestly, how do you do it?

56:31.155 --> 56:32.388
         - Oh, shut up!

56:32.390 --> 56:34.289
   - [Lily] No, answers, now!

56:34.291 --> 56:36.625
     Don't forget, you have
     a responsibility to...

56:38.062 --> 56:40.596
      You are responsible
      for my development.

56:41.565 --> 56:43.132
            - What?
       - Yup, it's true.

56:44.201 --> 56:45.701
        - Here, pass me
      that bag, will you?

56:45.703 --> 56:47.035
Sidney was supposed to be here,

56:47.037 --> 56:48.670
I don't know where he could be.

56:50.341 --> 56:54.076
  - She said that there are 10
  to 20 people outside waiting

56:54.078 --> 56:57.513
          to get your
     autograph! (squealing)

57:00.284 --> 57:01.150
            - Lily.

57:07.358 --> 57:08.357
            - What?

57:08.359 --> 57:10.025
     - That was Genevieve.

57:10.027 --> 57:11.827
     - [Lucinda] What, she
       just now got home?

57:11.829 --> 57:12.928
     - She didn't go home.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.497
   She didn't get on the bus.

57:15.499 --> 57:16.965
      - What do you mean?

57:16.967 --> 57:19.201
     - She kept saying," I
   can't, I can't, I can't",

57:19.203 --> 57:20.536
        about the baby.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.839
   I met her at a Starbucks.

57:23.841 --> 57:25.808
  She used the word abortion.

57:25.810 --> 57:27.276
     - And what did you do?

57:27.278 --> 57:29.011
      - I got her a hotel.
            - What?

57:29.013 --> 57:31.547
    - I'm going there now to
   meet her to calm her down.

57:31.549 --> 57:32.614
     - I'm going there now.

57:32.616 --> 57:35.083
         (somber music)

57:35.085 --> 57:38.487
         - Hey Lucinda.
      - No, not right now.

57:38.489 --> 57:39.955
  - [Fan] Just sign the paper!

58:01.445 --> 58:04.179
         (gentle music)

58:10.354 --> 58:14.256
 (singing in foreign language)

58:45.789 --> 58:48.357
         (tense music)

58:58.469 --> 59:01.303
       (throat clearing)

59:06.744 --> 59:10.145
    (elevator door dinging)

59:11.282 --> 59:14.383
     - Together, we need to
     handle this together.

59:14.385 --> 59:15.284
            - Move.

59:20.991 --> 59:22.424
  - [Sydney] I take the lead.

59:28.933 --> 59:31.934
       (knuckles rapping)

59:42.713 --> 59:44.513
      (Genevieve gasping)

59:44.515 --> 59:47.482
       (knuckles rapping)

59:48.886 --> 59:49.785
             - Hey.

59:56.694 --> 59:58.961
     - [Sydney] I think it
     it's time we all talk.

59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.129
   - [Lucinda] What is this?

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:05.167
          - Genevieve.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:07.703
       - You don't know?

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.274
        You don't know.

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.175
        - [Lucinda] No.

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:15.077
         I don't know.

01:00:19.383 --> 01:00:21.083
            - What.
        - I don't know.

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:22.684
       What is going on?

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:24.086
  - We're gonna work this out.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.691
        - I hate you so
       much, I hate you.

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.560
            - Okay.
       - Fucking bastard.

01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:32.527
        - [Sydney] Okay.

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:33.629
         - I hate you.
          - It's okay.

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:34.696
  We're gonna talk about this.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:35.631
    - How could you do this!
          - Fuck you!

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:36.732
  - Let's talk about it, okay?

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.133
        What's going on?
          - Fuck you.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.002
  - We'll talk about it okay?
       - Get out of here!

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:41.370
       - Whatever it is--
       - Leave, fuck you.

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:42.504
        - We're gonna--
    - It's okay, it's okay.

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:43.472
            Sidney!

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:44.573
- No, but he's such an asshole.

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:45.841
    - Sidney, Sidney leave.
          - Hey, hey!

01:00:45.843 --> 01:00:46.808
       - Get out of here!
        - Please, leave!

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.043
- [Sydney] All right, all right!

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:49.311
         I'm gonna go.
       - Fucking bastard!

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:50.145
       - I'm gonna go in
      the bathroom, okay.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:50.846
    - [Genevieve] Right now!

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:51.813
        Fuck, oh my god!

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.281
I hate you, I fucking hate you.

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:55.017
          - Calm down.
      - You need to leave.

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:57.219
     - I hate you so much!
 - Go outside, please, Sidney!

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:58.053
- I'm gonna go in the bathroom.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:58.887
      - Our fucking baby!

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:00.222
        Go outside now!

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:01.723
        - Five minutes!
  - You man, get out of here!

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:06.128
 - Five minutes, five minutes!
          - It's okay.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.396
           It's okay.

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:09.598
     I don't now anything,
     I'm in the dark, okay?

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:14.036
        (Sidney sighing)

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:18.507
      (Genevieve sighing)

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.079
        What's going on?

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:29.351
  Why are you still here, huh?

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:33.288
 Sidney mentioned an abortion.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:36.124
    What are you doing here?

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:37.793
 - I'm free, I'm fucking free,

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:38.994
   I stay where I wanna stay,

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:40.529
           I'm sorry!
         - Okay, okay!

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:41.563
         Okay, I just,

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.900
       I just wanna know
        what's going on.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:50.405
 What don't I know, Genevieve?

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:53.909
         (somber music)

01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:57.979
        What the fucking
       hell is going on?

01:01:57.981 --> 01:01:58.847
            Please!

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:08.256
        (Sidney sighing)

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:14.696
        (door squeaking)

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.435
      (people chattering)

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:24.272
     - I need a room on the
     8th floor, 802 or 803.

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:27.576
    - [Child] Cheeseburger,
  cheeseburger, cheeseburger!

01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:28.643
  - [Dad] It's okay, it's an--

01:02:28.645 --> 01:02:30.746
- [Kid] Cheeseburger right now!

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:33.248
     - Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:37.686
   The only thing that I have
available is the penthouse suite

01:02:37.688 --> 01:02:42.290
    for 1295, busy weekend,
   with the dog show and all.

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:43.658
 - [Kid] I want a cheeseburger.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.260
  Okay, I want a cheeseburger.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.695
     - [Dad] He's your son.

01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:48.163
     - [Kid] Cheeseburger,
  cheeseburger, cheeseburger,

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:49.631
   - I can't do that for you.
 - Cheeseburger, cheeseburger.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:50.599
   - I'm sorry, I don't know.
      - Cheeseburger, bud!

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:52.367
 - [Kid] I want a cheeseburger.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:55.036
 - You don't eat cheeseburgers.
    - I want a cheeseburger.

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:56.705
       I want a ketchup!
    - Why don't we just get.

01:02:56.707 --> 01:02:57.639
          - [Kid] No!

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:01.843
      (traffic whooshing)

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:19.127
        - Good morning.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.072
   I wasn't sleeping, I was,

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.378
  I was just resting my eyes.

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:46.555
       If you could just
       tell me something.

01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:47.722
       Anything, please.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:07.509
         (gentle music)

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.253
        (door clicking)

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.832
        (Lucinda crying)

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:47.616
       (Genevieve sighs)

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:22.217
 (speaking in foreign language)

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:40.969
       - Hey, last night,

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:47.475
  I know you don't deserve it.

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:53.381
    - If I did something to
     you, I didn't mean it.

01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:06.628
     - I was, I think I was

01:06:07.898 --> 01:06:12.500
     a little bit nervous,
     and then I got afraid.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:14.669
            Afraid.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:16.171
       - Afraid of what?

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.376
         - To be alone.

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:25.013
        (Lucinda sighs)

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:34.122
      (traffic puttering)

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:56.911
       (Genevieve sighs)

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:07.522
  (people chattering faintly)
      (traffic whooshing)

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:43.224
         (gentle music)

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:49.343
         (gentle music)
