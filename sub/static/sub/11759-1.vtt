OK. Thank you.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.607
Operation Damson
is an ongoing initiative

00:12.640 --> 00:16.884
aimed at detection/prevention
of gangland murders.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.285
Surveillance of a suspect

00:18.320 --> 00:20.322
under Operation Damson
has been in place

00:20.360 --> 00:23.489
at an address for less than 24
hours, with intelligence sources

00:23.520 --> 00:25.568
indicating a significant belief

00:25.600 --> 00:29.446
the suspect is preparing
to commit a gangland execution.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.326
The suspect is a known criminal,
with a history of violence.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.567
He is expected to be armed...

00:35.600 --> 00:39.047

vehicles, each crew to be

00:50.440 --> 00:53.046
positioned on the suspect's
possible routes of travel,

Armed police!

03:59.800 --> 04:01.086
OK.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.929
Come on! Come on!

04:09.960 --> 04:11.644
(Distant shouting) Police!

04:23.120 --> 04:24.326
- Skipper!
- Shots fired

04:24.360 --> 04:26.362
Where is he'? Danny'?

04:29.720 --> 04:31.722
Danny'?

04:32.800 --> 04:35.406
- Armed police!
- Oh, shit.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.961
Hari. Hari, mate, he's down.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.207
He refused to surrender
his firearm.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.442
Jesus Christ,
look where the gun is!

04:44.480 --> 04:47.086
- How'd it get over there?
- Muscle spasm, he chucked it.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.122
Look at what it looks like,
though, Danny.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.208
Good point.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.449
- Hey, hey, Danny, Danny.
- It was self-defence.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.408
But we all know
the shit I'll get for it.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.124
- Skipper, wait.
- For Christ sake!

04:59.160 --> 05:00.491
You're making it worse.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.329
I don't want to see you lot
in the shit.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.328
- Us'?
- We didn't do nothing.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.283
That's the problem.
So I'll cover for you

05:06.320 --> 05:08.641
and say we got here together,
shouted, "Armed police!"

05:08.680 --> 05:10.887
- but he pulled a gun.
- What are you talking about?

05:10.920 --> 05:13.400
He would have surrendered
if you'd got here in time.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.125
That's my report unless
the lot of you man up right now.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.364
Discharge your weapons.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.528
- No way.
- Shoot over the suspect's body

05:21.560 --> 05:23.324
in the direction
you'd have fired

05:23.360 --> 05:26.330
if you'd actually managed
to get here in time.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.931
- No.
- (Approaching sirens)

05:28.960 --> 05:30.530
Shoot now!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.002
(Police radio in background)

05:39.480 --> 05:41.084
(Dog barks)

05:44.760 --> 05:46.364
Shoot.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.600
Shoot. You choked.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.966
Plausible.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.728
- Jesus!
- (Dogs bark)

05:58.440 --> 06:01.728
MCANDREW: <i>Five Zero,
status report. Status report?</i>

06:08.080 --> 06:10.890
We're all in this together.
The best way.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.326
- Is anyone hum'?
- We're fine, thanks, guv.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.488
Suspect down.
Repeat. Suspect down!

06:22.520 --> 06:24.648
Store your weapons.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.609
Victor Charlie Four One,

06:27.640 --> 06:30.041
requesting forensic deployment
for the scene.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.970
All AFOs and weapons require
transporting to base

06:33.000 --> 06:36.083
for forensic recovery
of evidence and debrief.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.122
- You're sure you're OK'?
- Fine.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.082
Everyone did their job.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.406
Sir.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.851
- Carry on.
- Sir.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.484
Carry on.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.530
Sir.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.050
Steve?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.810
What do you reckon, son'?
One for us'?

07:05.600 --> 07:08.206
Yeah. One for us.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.484
Sir.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.124
As you were.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.128
Forensics will take
your firearms,

07:20.160 --> 07:23.084
gunshot residue samples,
clothing, nail scrapings.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.249
You are to remain at the station
until they advise they don't

07:26.280 --> 07:28.009
- need any further samples.
- Sir.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.566
You're all entitled to 48 hours'
recovery time.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.365
You'll all be offered
post-traumatic counselling.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.006
My advice is to use
these 48 hours wisely.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.246
Sir.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.802
(Engine starts)

08:01.960 --> 08:03.928
For the tape,
confirm you are the officer

08:03.960 --> 08:06.122
using the call sign
Victor Charlie Five One.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.525
lam.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.449
Document 2 in your folders.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.768
This FA-1 was issued to AFOs
at South Ferry Police Station

08:12.800 --> 08:14.848
on the day of 13th of May
of this year.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.803
- Do you recognise that form'?
- I do, sir.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.842
- Is that your signature?
- It is, sir.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.565
According to the FA-1, you were
issued with a Glock 17

08:21.600 --> 08:26.527
service pistol, serial number
Mike-November-8746546,

08:26.560 --> 08:28.801
and 9 X 19 millimetre
Parabellum rounds.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.286
- I was.
- Now, can you inform us

08:31.320 --> 08:34.767
as to how you personally became
involved in Operation Dams-an?

08:36.080 --> 08:39.083
It was a real-time deployment
authorised by the SFC.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.770
<i>I travelled in
the second vehicle,</i>

08:40.799 --> 08:42.609
<i>designated
Victor Charlie Five Zero,</i>

08:42.640 --> 08:44.483
<i>crewed by myself
and the rest of my team.</i>

08:44.520 --> 08:47.251
The rest of your team are
APO Victor Charlie Five Two,

08:47.280 --> 08:48.805
APO Victor Charlie Five Three

08:48.840 --> 08:50.842
and APO Victor Charlie
Five Four.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.565
We deployed to a holding
position on one of four

08:53.600 --> 08:56.729
exit routes for the suspect
and maintained radio contact

08:56.760 --> 08:58.762
with the operational senior APO.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.121
Please confirm
this was an inspector using

09:01.160 --> 09:02.969
the call sign Victor Charlie
Four One.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.004
Correct. Victor Charlie Four One
notified me that the suspect was

09:06.040 --> 09:07.929
travelling towards us
and authorised us

09:07.960 --> 09:09.644
to carry out
a real-time intercept.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.364
A real-time intercept, yeah.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.610
Things get a wee bit fuzzy...
for me here, Sergeant.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.645
Maybe you could be a ray of
sunshine and burn off the fog.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.722
Hm'?

09:28.160 --> 09:29.764
I'm waiting.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.529
Sir, I'm waiting for a question.

09:31.560 --> 09:35.087
What the Super's asking you is
how come, as per the statement

09:35.120 --> 09:36.724
given by Victor Charlie
Four One,

09:36.760 --> 09:38.888
you were ordered
to wait for support

09:38.920 --> 09:40.445
Not ordered. Advised.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.211
But you went ahead and carried
out the hard-stop anyway.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.129
The suspect was travelling
at high speed

09:45.160 --> 09:47.891
to an unknown destination
with the intention of committing

09:47.920 --> 09:50.400
- a gangland execution.
- Or so the intelligence said.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.807
The intelligence did say
and, if that's wrong, sir,

09:52.840 --> 09:54.604
well, take it up with them.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.007
Can we please just stick to
a line of questioning

09:57.040 --> 09:59.407
that relates to Victor Charlie
Five One's actions?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.044
On you go, Sergeant.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.084
It'll help if I refer to the map
in our folders.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.764
Document 4.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.802
Travelling at high speed along
Prince's Road, the suspect

10:12.840 --> 10:16.049
approached a line of parked cars
with open road ahead.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.242
I was concerned if we didn't
carry out the hard stop

10:18.280 --> 10:19.520
the suspect would get away.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.562
Oh, and that was your decision,
was it'?

10:21.600 --> 10:25.047
No, sir. It was the decision of
the Strategic Firearms Commander

10:25.080 --> 10:27.845
who designated the operational
objective of preventing

10:27.880 --> 10:30.201
the suspect carrying out
an act of lethal force.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.890
Added to which,
as police officers,

10:31.920 --> 10:34.810
it's a non-negotiable duty
to protect the public.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.842
May I answer the question now?

10:36.880 --> 10:38.928
HASTINGS: Please do.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.644
Fearing the suspect
would get away

10:40.680 --> 10:42.682
and pose a danger to the public,

10:42.720 --> 10:45.405
I took the decision to close off
his route of escape by

10:45.440 --> 10:48.523
executing a hard-stop manoeuvre
on Prince's Road that trapped

10:48.560 --> 10:51.211
the suspects vehicle between
ours and the parked cars.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.925
The suspect then
made his escape on foot

10:53.960 --> 10:55.962
via an alleyway
and I gave chase.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.729
This foot chase led to a
confrontation in Prince's Court.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.525
We need you to tell us
all about this confrontation.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.166
Once in Prince's Court,
almost immediately,

11:05.200 --> 11:07.043
the suspect realised
he was cornered.

11:07.080 --> 11:11.324
The suspect turned his weapon on
us and fired. We returned fire.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.046
Shots struck the suspect in the
head and proved instantly fatal.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.401
We've received written
statements from yourself

11:17.440 --> 11:18.851
and the other AFOs on your team.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.884
Said statements agree you all
entered Prince's Court together.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.331
Correct.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.964
See, the thing is,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.686
we've got a statement off of
an eyewitness on Prince's Road.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.768
Says that you entered
that rough ground

11:30.800 --> 11:33.007
at least 30 seconds before
the rest of your team.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.930
I was first out of our vehicle.
That misled the eyewitness.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.564
You're saying she's mistaken?

11:37.600 --> 11:40.729
My written statement and those
of my team are accurate.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.205
Yes, they are.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.404
And entirely consistent
in every detail.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.722
You and your team,
you acted as one'?

11:50.760 --> 11:52.171
Correct.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.568
Not always the case with you
and your teams, though, is it?

11:55.600 --> 11:58.206
In your four years at South
Ferry, there's been transfer

11:58.240 --> 12:00.891
<i>requests from officers who
didn't want to be in your team.</i>

12:00.920 --> 12:02.922
WALDRON: Some guys can't cut it.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.724
<i>I want them off my squad.</i>

12:04.760 --> 12:07.491
<i>To save face, they put in
for a transfer request.</i>

12:07.520 --> 12:10.285
ARNOTT: None of these officers
had a problem with you?

12:10.320 --> 12:12.129
I've got high standards.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.244
That's their problem.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.802
Se, you all entered
Prince's Court together?

12:18.840 --> 12:20.444
Yes, sir.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.244
We were moving fast on foot,

12:22.280 --> 12:24.408
but I carried out
a rapid risk assessment,

12:24.440 --> 12:27.444
noting no members of the public
were in immediate jeopardy.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.642
I called, "Armed police!"

12:29.680 --> 12:32.604
The suspect turned his weapon
on us and opened fire.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.130
I returned fire.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.889
The suspect fell to the ground.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.127
Immediate examination
of the suspect

12:38.160 --> 12:39.889
by Victor Charlie Five Four

12:39.920 --> 12:42.048
revealed serious wounds
to the head.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.162
The suspect had
absent respiration

12:44.200 --> 12:46.202
and his pulse was also absent.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.368
I secured his firearm.
A few moments later,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.482
Victor Charlie Four One
arrived on the scene

12:50.520 --> 12:53.091
with her team and assumed
operational command.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.407
You discharged your pistols,
not your 636s'?

12:55.440 --> 12:58.171
We confronted the suspect
in a confined space,

12:58.200 --> 12:59.770
bounded by hard surfaces.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.724
Given the G36 has
a muzzle velocity of over 900

13:02.760 --> 13:06.207
metres per second, I identified
a significant risk our rounds

13:06.240 --> 13:07.969
might pass through the suspect

13:08.000 --> 13:10.207
and ricochet back at us,
causing injury.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.641
We don't have an eyewitness
to the shooting.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.048
- But we've three ear-witnesses.
- Three independent witnesses.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.924
Each ear-witness claims to have
heard a group of gunshots,

13:18.960 --> 13:22.169
followed closely by what sounded
like a second group of gunshots,

13:22.200 --> 13:24.407
followed closely by
a single gunshot.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.610
As per my written statement,
it's a matter of fact

13:28.640 --> 13:31.610
that there was one shot fired by
the suspect, immediately

13:31.640 --> 13:34.849
followed by a group of shots
fired simultaneously by myself,

13:34.880 --> 13:37.963
Victor Charlie Five Two
and Victor Charlie Five Three.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.207
These independent ear-witnesses

13:40.240 --> 13:42.322
would seem to contradict
said fact.

13:42.360 --> 13:45.091
It's an accepted
and well-recognised acoustic

13:45.120 --> 13:47.851
phenomenon that an ear-witness
can be deceived by up to six

13:47.880 --> 13:50.645
different sounds associated with
a single gunshot.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.569
Document 6 in your folders.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.850
The forensic report regarding
Operation Damson.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.884
Gunshot residue from the
discharge of a Glock 17 pistol

13:59.920 --> 14:02.924
was detected on the hands
and clothing of the following.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.769
Victor Charlie Five One,

14:04.800 --> 14:07.929
Victor Charlie Five Two
and Victor Charlie Five Three.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.724
They all discharged
their weapons.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.250
No-one's disputing that.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.602
A Colt 1911 A1 pistol was found
in the suspect's right hand.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.325
Gunshot residue from
the discharge of this firearm

14:17.360 --> 14:18.885
was detected on the suspect.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.491
Gunshot residue from the Colt
was also detected

14:21.520 --> 14:23.329
on Victor Charlie Five One.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.726
Are you able to explain
this finding,

14:29.760 --> 14:31.762
<i>Victor Charlie Five One?</i>

14:31.800 --> 14:35.168
<i>I secured the suspects firearm,
causing secondary transfer</i>

14:35.200 --> 14:37.646
<i>of residue after the firearm
had been discharged.</i>

14:37.680 --> 14:40.365
This explains the high
concentration of residue.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.811
Does it'?

14:41.840 --> 14:45.083
Concentration and distribution
are characteristic of a gunman.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.124
- Caused when I secured the gun.
- You expect us to believe that'?

14:48.160 --> 14:50.970
At a distance of approximately
five metres from the suspect,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.890
there was a concentration of
gunshot residue on the ground.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.730
Said gunshot residue matched
the suspect's firearm.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.489
How do you account for this'?

14:58.520 --> 15:01.524
The suspect was in motion
as he turned towards my team.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.164
He covered a short distance

15:03.200 --> 15:05.089
between raising the gun
and firing it.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.805
Gunshot residue is on the ground
where the body was found.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.251
That's where he fired the gun.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.601
Why is there residue
five metres away, as well'?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.005
He has answered the question.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.804
Did the gun
ever lie in a position

15:14.840 --> 15:16.922
on the ground,
five metres from the suspect?

15:16.960 --> 15:18.962
No, it did not.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.844
HASTINGS: Steve?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.569
Document 11.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.127
The postmortem result.
Three bullets were recovered

15:32.160 --> 15:35.448
from the head wounds and were
identified as 9 X 19 millimetre

15:35.480 --> 15:38.211
Parabellum rounds
fired by a Glock 17 pistol

15:38.240 --> 15:41.847
issued to Authorised Firearms
Officer Victor Charlie Five One.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.885
Three shots. Oh, you made sure,
didn't you, Sergeant?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.685
Victor Charlie Five One
regrets the loss of life,

15:49.720 --> 15:51.722
but I don't need
to remind everyone

15:51.760 --> 15:55.242
that he was an Authorised
Firearms Officer acting on

15:55.280 --> 15:58.204
the lawful orders of
a Strategic Firearms Commander.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.810
- You regret killing him'?
- I've said...

15:59.840 --> 16:01.922
I'm asking
Victor Charlie Five One.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.566
Victor Charlie Five One
has the right to be interviewed

16:04.600 --> 16:06.602
by an officer
at least one rank superior.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.890
Do you regret killing him,
Victor Charlie Five One'?

16:11.920 --> 16:13.763
I regret the loss of life.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.804
- Three shots, fella!
- Standard practice is to aim at

16:16.840 --> 16:18.410
the maximum body mass -
the chest.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.488
- Why head shots?
- I was ten metres away

16:20.520 --> 16:22.921
in good visibility,
the shots were achievable.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.122
Standard practice
is double-tap the trigger.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.447
- Discharging shots in pairs.
- Not two, not four.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.528
He collapsed after the third
so I ceased fire.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.369
Yeah, right.
Shot him down like a dog.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.846
- Your language is inflammatory.
- Yeah.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.644
<i>ARNOTT. You'd prefer
to have wounded him?</i>

16:35.680 --> 16:37.250
WALDRON:
We don't shoot to <i>wound.</i>

16:37.280 --> 16:39.282
<i>We shoot to neutralise
the lethal threat.</i>

16:39.320 --> 16:41.368
You were the only APO
to strike the target.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.926
- Yes, that's what happened.
- Listen to me, son.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.328
We weren't born yesterday. You
shot that fella in cold blood

16:47.360 --> 16:49.727
while your wee mates
stood by and watched.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.047
I shot first, the others
fired a fraction later,

16:52.080 --> 16:54.686
by which time the suspect had
collapsed and they missed.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.722
You saw all that
in a fraction of a second?

16:56.760 --> 16:59.081
I've never been to
this building before.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.407
You saw me walk into
this interview room

17:01.440 --> 17:03.727
and sit down
in a matter of a few seconds.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.489
Over my left shoulder are
three rows of open-plan desks

17:08.520 --> 17:10.089
in front of a glass partition

17:10.119 --> 17:13.044
dividing the open-plan area
from a private office.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.569
Range 20 metres.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.807
Seated at the desks
are seven personnel,

17:16.839 --> 17:19.080
comprising four males
and three females.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.521
Over my right shoulder
is a longitudinal partition

17:21.560 --> 17:24.325
at chest height, beyond which
is gate-controlled access.

17:24.359 --> 17:25.691
Range 20 metres.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.530
Entrance and exit to this floor
are via key-controlled lifts

17:28.560 --> 17:31.211
adjacent to the waiting area
at my four o'clock position.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.571
Range 35 metres.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.090
Why the second shot'?

17:34.120 --> 17:36.202
- Why the third?
- The first shot was fatal.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.049
Why did you keep firing'?

17:38.080 --> 17:39.969
Were you losing it out there,
fella?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.765
I cite under common law
my lawful right to use

17:42.800 --> 17:44.928
"lethal force
for preservation of life

17:44.960 --> 17:47.770
or in self-defence
where this threat is immediate."

17:47.800 --> 17:50.883
Yes. In response, I cite Section
117 of the Police and Criminal

17:50.920 --> 17:53.400
Evidence Act, the use of
"reasonable force" and,

17:53.440 --> 17:57.161
for the tape, the emphasis is
mine, not contained in the Act.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.601
That's an easy argument
from behind a desk, sir.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.769
From behind this desk, Sergeant,
we uphold standards.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.842
Standards
you're expected to meet

18:05.880 --> 18:07.882
as a serving police officer.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.491
Do you recognise
the man in this image'?

18:16.480 --> 18:18.642
I object in the strongest
possible terms.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.526
Victor Charlie Five One's been
involved in an extremely tragic

18:22.560 --> 18:24.164
and distressing incident

18:24.200 --> 18:27.488
and this line of inquiry is
offensive and insensitive.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.730
Your man doesn't strike me
as the, er, sensitive type.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.686
Are you?

18:35.760 --> 18:37.285
Am I what'?

18:38.080 --> 18:39.730
Sensitive.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.009
<i>On your personnel file,
there's no recorded next of kin.</i>

18:45.080 --> 18:46.445
<i>Wife?</i>

18:46.480 --> 18:47.925
<i>Fiancée?</i>

18:47.960 --> 18:50.770
This line of questioning has
no bearing on the investigation.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.564
We don't know that yet.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.204
I'm single.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.682
The suspect was
an armed criminal

19:02.720 --> 19:04.324
with a history of violence,

19:04.360 --> 19:07.489
posing an immediate and credible
threat to the public.

19:08.840 --> 19:12.049
In respect of Operation Damson,
on May 13th,

19:12.080 --> 19:15.880
the Strategic Firearms Commander
authorised the use of firearms.

19:15.920 --> 19:20.403
Under Section 3 of the Criminal
Law Act 1967, I am also

19:20.440 --> 19:23.728
entitled to use such force as is
reasonable in the circumstances

19:23.760 --> 19:25.967
to prevent crime
and, under Section 117

19:26.000 --> 19:28.685
of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984,

19:28.720 --> 19:30.848
I am entitled to use
reasonable force

19:30.880 --> 19:32.882
in the exercise of
police powers.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.049
Under Common Law, I have the
lawful right to use lethal force

19:36.080 --> 19:38.401
for preservation of life
or in self-defence

19:38.440 --> 19:40.124
where this threat is immediate.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.686
At no time has anyone
in this room put forward

19:42.720 --> 19:45.200
credible evidence
that I acted unlawfully

19:45.240 --> 19:47.811
and, therefore, I formally
request that my withdrawal

19:47.840 --> 19:51.049
from operational deployment
be lifted and my firearms permit

19:51.080 --> 19:54.163
be reinstated, so I can get back
to doing what I do best.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.080
This investigation
is far from over, son.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.562
As far as I'm concerned, we've
only just scratched the surface.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.887
<i>Requests denied.
Interview terminated.</i>

20:04.920 --> 20:06.922
(Glass wall muffles speech)

20:07.880 --> 20:09.882
Desk duty only.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.090
(Presses button)

20:29.880 --> 20:31.882
Danny, don't do this.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.571
What was that'? My personal life'?
What was that'?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.523
- Nothing personal.
- No'?

20:36.560 --> 20:38.767
- Interviews finished, Danny.
- I'm not.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.406
Good. Neither are we.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.202
WOMAN:
There isn't a bomb under it.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.169
But there ought to be.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.722
Fortunately, I booked a table.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.888
Somewhere
ridiculously expensive.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.922
Well, I guess I had that coming.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.962
I'm so sorry, I forgot...

22:00.960 --> 22:02.564
All right.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.409
Then what am I...

22:05.880 --> 22:07.882
supposed to do with these?

22:08.960 --> 22:10.644
Happy anniversary.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.606
- (Bell rings)
- Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

23:07.640 --> 23:09.722
Victor Charlie Two Zero,
on our way.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.445
McANDREW: Victor Charlie
Two Zero, received.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.647
(Engines start)

23:17.480 --> 23:20.165
(Bell continues ringing)

23:20.200 --> 23:22.202
- (Phone rings nearby)
- (Sighs)

23:56.320 --> 23:58.482
It's all right, mate.
You leave it to us. Yeah'?

24:07.840 --> 24:09.569
Oi.

24:12.520 --> 24:15.091
Are you gonna tell us
how it went with AC-12?

24:16.480 --> 24:19.245
- You first.
- We stuck to the story, mate.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.328
Like you gave us
much of a choice.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.681
So we all stuck to the story.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.722
(Door opens)

24:25.760 --> 24:27.489
- All right'?
- All right.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.687
They'll go through the motions,
hit a brick wall. Case closed.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.200
- You want us to play along'?
- It's worked so far.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.368
- So far'?
- What's your problem'?

24:41.520 --> 24:43.124
My problem...

24:43.160 --> 24:45.162
(Voices in background)

24:45.920 --> 24:47.809
My problem...

24:47.840 --> 24:50.730
is what really happened
with you and that suspect.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.802
Don't try playing the big man.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.002
We both know
you're not up to it.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.089
She definitely does.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.082
<i>Muffled speech</i>

25:14.120 --> 25:16.122
(Laughter)

25:20.760 --> 25:23.684
(Knocks) All right to come in
with the gaffer for a minute'?

25:23.720 --> 25:25.529
Sure.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.369
Kate, thanks.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.404
We're just discussing
the Daniel Waldron shooting.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.522
Is there an undercover
assignment?

25:36.560 --> 25:39.131
Look, can I just say,
this feels like a long shot'?

25:39.160 --> 25:41.367
Kate was kept out of
the interview on purpose

25:41.400 --> 25:43.482
to give us this option.
We should use it.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.602
Remind me, Kate.
Are you firearms trained'?

25:45.640 --> 25:47.290
Yes, sir, I am.

25:47.320 --> 25:49.322
The statements
given by Waldron's team

25:49.360 --> 25:52.364
are all highly consistent,
that's not suspicious in itself,

25:52.400 --> 25:54.721
given 48 hours
to get their stories straight.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.081
The question is whether
Waldron's story adds up

25:57.120 --> 25:59.691
and whether his squad is really
as loyal as they appear.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.200
The only way to know
is with Kate on the case.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.050
Putting Kate into an AFO role
is a whole level efjeepardy

26:05.080 --> 26:08.209
- above a normal undercover...
- I can handle it.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.402
(Music and chatter)

26:10.440 --> 26:13.922
It's kind of a regular thing.
First Wednesday of every month.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.088
You all right'?
Lets off a bit of steam.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.122
- I'm in.
- What can I get you'?

26:18.160 --> 26:20.686
- Oh, no. My shout, guv.
- ls the right answer.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.041
- Vodka and tonic. A big one.
- Coming up.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.844
The New APO.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.291
Kate...?

26:26.320 --> 26:27.924
Kate Francis.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.200
All right'?

26:29.240 --> 26:31.846
- All right for a drink'?
- Yeah. Got one here. Thanks.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.769
Got off lightly. Nice one.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.250
You've got to be kidding me.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.449
All right'?

26:52.760 --> 26:54.171
Relax, mate. Off duty.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.850
You don't do
the monthly piss-up.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.848
A bit of bonding
felt like a good idea.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.489
No-one gonna buy me a drink'?

27:00.520 --> 27:03.364
- What are you having, skipper?
- Mineral water.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.970
Still.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.326
Ta.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.327
How are you doing, then'?
You all right'?

27:24.360 --> 27:25.646
Fine.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.330
You'?

27:28.240 --> 27:30.402
Yeah, I'm good, yeah.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.124
I think I'd best give Jackie
a hand with them drinks.

27:41.720 --> 27:43.404
McANDREW: Danny.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.044
Evening, ma'am.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.650
Meet Kate Francis.

27:46.680 --> 27:48.887
- Kate, Danny Waldron.
- Are you all right'?

27:48.920 --> 27:52.049
- How are you doing'?
- Thanks for the drink, Kate.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.162
- That's all right.
- See you in a bit.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.011
- You're new, then'?
- Yeah, I got posted while...

28:01.040 --> 28:03.042
While I've been chained
to a desk.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.811
Sorry. They give you
the firepower, but when you

28:05.840 --> 28:08.525
actually do what's necessary,
suddenly you're a pariah.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.329
Where are you posted from'?

28:12.360 --> 28:13.964
East Mids.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.169
You know what, Jackie, I think
we'd best call it a night.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.521
Laila ain't sleeping too good,
you know.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.602
Can't say I blame you, mate.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.604
- See you in a bit.
- See you.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.722
- Would you excuse me'?
- Yeah, of course.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.006
Hari.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.202
You sure everythings all right'?

28:40.240 --> 28:41.844
Yeah, it's fine, yeah.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.486
It's just the missus
ain't sleeping too good.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.524
Why do I get the feeling
you're not 100% on board'?

28:49.280 --> 28:50.884
l am.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.043
I'm going home...so Laila
can grab an early night, yeah.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.007
You need me to make
the hard choices for you.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.322
Because I see what's inside you.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.610
Jelly.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.290
The fact is, if we'd not stuck
together, AC-12 would be

29:13.320 --> 29:15.322
charging the lot of us,
not just me.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.370
Worth bearing in mind,

29:18.400 --> 29:21.006
when you've got that nice
little family to provide for.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.010
Love to Laila.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.562
(Chatter)

29:51.200 --> 29:52.690
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.131
Danny.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.650
Rachel.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.244
Big night out'?

30:01.280 --> 30:03.248
Just a quiet one with workmates.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.371
- Your workmates'?
- Yeah.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.765
Would it be OK if I...
bought you another drink'?

30:12.800 --> 30:14.848
Yeah, that would be OK.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.405
A dry white wine'?

30:16.440 --> 30:17.680
Very good.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.131
Great.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.490
This is me.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.162
It's really nice to meet you.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.202
Nice to meet you, too.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.924
Can I kiss you'?

31:03.080 --> 31:05.526
- That was nice.
- Very nice.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.802
- Can I get your phone number'?
- Sure.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.089
What's yours?

31:15.120 --> 31:21.366
Er, it's 07700922621.

31:22.360 --> 31:23.805
OK.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.482
Er... Here's mine.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.127
- (Text alert)
- Got it.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.322
Thank you.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.687
- Good night, Rachel.
- Good night.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.520
Listen, Hari, can I talk to you
about something?

32:10.760 --> 32:14.003
In the pub, I couldn't help
noticing you and Danny.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.042
Is he giving you a hard time?

32:16.720 --> 32:19.371
Well, when hasn't he'?
But that's just what he's like.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.768
You all stood by him
after he killed a suspect.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.887
Did it really happen
the way you all said it did'?

32:25.920 --> 32:27.410
My advice to you is don't ask.

32:27.440 --> 32:31.081
I don't think you've got
any idea what he's capable of.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.690
Not a clue.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.605
Kate'?

32:47.640 --> 32:49.642
Danny Waldron's squad.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.081
If anyone's got a wobble,
it's Hari Bains.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.369
Received.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.004
<i>The suspect turned his gun on us
and we returned fire.</i>

33:03.120 --> 33:06.522
<i>The suspect, he discharged
his weapon and we returned fire.</i>

33:10.200 --> 33:13.602
CLOTTAN: <i>Would it be easier for
you to tell us who fired first?</i>

33:15.680 --> 33:19.207
<i>The suspect fired his pistol
at us and we fired back at him.</i>

33:23.280 --> 33:25.681
HASTINGS: <i>But you didn't,
did you, Constable?</i>

33:25.720 --> 33:30.009
<i>No, sir. No. The suspect had
already taken fire to the head</i>

33:30.040 --> 33:31.530
<i>and he went down.</i>

33:31.560 --> 33:34.131
HASTINGS: <i>So, what?
You hesitated, is that it?</i>

33:34.160 --> 33:35.650
<i>No, sir.</i>

33:35.680 --> 33:38.809
<i>No, it just all felt like it
happened in the same moment.</i>

33:38.840 --> 33:42.162
<i>You know, the suspect firing
and then him being taken down.</i>

33:42.200 --> 33:44.931
<i>ARNOTT. Why was there
a patch of gunshot residue</i>

33:44.960 --> 33:48.282
<i>from the suspecfis firearm
five metres away from his body?</i>

33:49.600 --> 33:51.887
<i>It must have been the suspect
was moving</i>

33:51.920 --> 33:54.321
<i>from one position to the other
as he fired.</i>

33:55.120 --> 33:57.009
<i>HASTINGS: Must have?</i>

33:57.040 --> 34:00.362
I mean, he...he was.
He was moving when he fired.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.685
ARNOTT: We know it's not easy,
being confined to desk duty.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.690
COTTAN: Particularly if you're
the only one who didn't fire.

34:18.679 --> 34:21.001
Well, I didn't choke,
if that's what you mean.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.882
No-one said you choked.

34:22.920 --> 34:26.844
Yeah, well, you're AC-l2, you're
always looking for an angle.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.442
We appreciate
there's trust issues.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.766
No-one wants to seem like
they're telling tales.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.770
But no-one wants to let a bent
copper off the hook, either.

34:36.760 --> 34:40.650
But we've read your record.
You're an honest copper.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.808
This is bothering you,
Harinderpal.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.444
Hari.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.330
It's bothering you, Hari. A lot.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.441
Look, I told Waldron to let the
suspect go. We were in pursuit.

35:01.480 --> 35:04.529
The bloke was gonna carry out a
hit, half the Force on his tail.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.245
You knew Waldron was out of
control and tried to deter him'?

35:07.280 --> 35:10.045
- I never said "out of control".
COTTAN: What are you saying?

35:10.080 --> 35:13.129
You followed Danny Waldron's
script to the letter.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.084
Except for one moment. The
little patch of gunshot residue

35:16.120 --> 35:18.726
that was nowhere near where
the suspects gun was found.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.171
See what I mean'?

35:20.200 --> 35:23.044
You act like every copper's bent
till he's proven otherwise.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.889
- But I'm clean.
COTTAN: Prove it.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.649
Tell us what really happened.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.251
Why was there so much
gunshot residue on Waldron'?

35:29.280 --> 35:32.489
What did he really do when he
claimed he was securing it'?

35:35.760 --> 35:37.489
I can't do this.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.364
(Clears throat) I'm sorry.
I can't do this. There's...

35:40.400 --> 35:44.121
There's no way I'm testifying
against Danny Waldron.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.370
(Engine starts)

36:05.400 --> 36:07.164
<i>Hari Bains is
damned if he does,</i>

36:07.200 --> 36:09.009
damned if he doesn't,
poor bugger.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.963
We'll be able to compel him.
I'm sure, sir.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.365
If we can get to threshold,

36:12.400 --> 36:14.402
he'll go with the flew
to save his own neck.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.522
We're a long way
from threshold yet, though.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.803
I've really got to go now.
Talk later. Bye.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.763
- Gill.
- Sorry.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.768
The Police Federation
are pushing back

36:24.800 --> 36:26.802
against Danny Waldron's
treatment.

36:26.840 --> 36:29.684
I got an email from their lawyer
that was three pages long.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.689
They want him operational and
his firearms permit reinstated,

36:33.720 --> 36:37.247
unless you can show there's
substantive suspicion of crime

36:37.280 --> 36:40.124
and/or misconduct and/or
Endangerment to Public Trust.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.650
Well, we've got them all.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.921
You don't have
Endangerment of Public Trust

36:43.960 --> 36:46.486
as Operation Damson
remains unreponed in the press

36:46.520 --> 36:48.124
as per a legal
suppression order.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.811
So, what have you got regarding
crime and/or misconduct?

36:50.840 --> 36:53.684
There's a strong suspicion
Danny Waldron was adjacent

36:53.720 --> 36:56.087
to the suspect when the
suspects firearm went eff,

36:56.120 --> 36:57.645
and that Waldron
moved the firearm

36:57.680 --> 36:59.284
before Forensics
got to the scene.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.129
I've listened to the tape.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.889
You all did your best,

37:02.920 --> 37:06.322
but Waldron deals plausibly
with all your areas of inquiry

37:06.360 --> 37:08.567
and his team's statements
back him up.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.331
We interviewed one of his team,
PC Harinderpal Bains,

37:11.360 --> 37:13.362
who we strongly suspect
is detachable

37:13.400 --> 37:15.209
from Waldron's version
of events.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.322
- Is he on the record'?
- No, ma'am, but...

37:17.360 --> 37:20.967
I'm a civilian - Gill or Miss
Biggeloe. So not on the record.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.729
No. But we have
an officer undercover

37:22.760 --> 37:25.081
probing for weaknesses
in the team's statements.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.645
Has she found any'?

37:26.680 --> 37:28.682
Not yet,
but she's only just started.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.927
So she hasn't.

37:30.960 --> 37:33.486
Look, I've seen enough
bent coppers in my time

37:33.520 --> 37:35.249
to know when one
is hiding something.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.884
You know why
I've been appointed?

37:36.920 --> 37:39.924
To ensure that anticorruption
inquiries don't get pulled apart

37:39.960 --> 37:42.327
in court, to everyone's
embarrassment.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.125
Yeah, well, we'd all be
severely embarrassed if

37:45.160 --> 37:48.323
Daniel Waldron manages to pull
something like this off again.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.523
We are protecting the public
and, sometimes, that means

37:51.560 --> 37:53.961
we have to protect them
from our own officers.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.240
Legally, this case is weak.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.090
Juries don't convict police
officers for killing suspects.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.407
I've got no option but
to recommend that Waldron

38:00.440 --> 38:02.044
and his team
return to active duty

38:02.080 --> 38:04.686
and that their firearms permits
are reinstated.

38:13.320 --> 38:16.483
What'? She's running
our investigations now'?

38:19.760 --> 38:21.888
Search of premises.
Class A drugs.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.526
Residents are known
to be in possession

38:24.560 --> 38:26.562
and have access to firearms.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.564
Good to be back.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.004
WALDRON: Armed police!

38:57.640 --> 38:59.130
Armed police!

38:59.160 --> 39:02.721
Jacks, you, Rod and Hari secure
these rooms. Kate, with me.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.770
Go. Go.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.562
WALDRON: Armed police!

39:27.800 --> 39:29.040
Armed police!

39:33.280 --> 39:34.850
Armed police!

39:44.280 --> 39:46.282
All clear. Check the landing.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.681
Kate, check in with the others.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.409
Victor Charlie Five Five.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.965
ROD: <i>Five</i> Two.
- Status?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.490
<i>Still checking.</i>

40:21.120 --> 40:23.122
Move. Move!

40:26.440 --> 40:28.169
Armed police!

40:28.200 --> 40:30.202
(Birds fluttering away)

40:44.400 --> 40:46.004
- No!
- Aah!

40:48.520 --> 40:50.488
Check your safety. Stand down.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.124
Get the search team in here.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.766
And we need an ambulance
and social services.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.245
BAINS: Yes, skipper.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.521
It's all right.
No-one's gonna hum you.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.324
Good boy.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.330
- (Boy grizzles)
WALDRON: It's all right. Ssh.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.169
How old are you, eh'?

41:08.720 --> 41:10.722
(Boy cries)

41:14.000 --> 41:15.604
Hi, it's me.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.762
Yeah, fine.
Just I'll be busy later.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.326
I just wanted to get him
before he went to bed.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.606
Thanks.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.767
Hi, sweetheart
Have you had a nice day'?

41:30.760 --> 41:32.171
Have you'?

41:32.200 --> 41:34.202
Aw, that's lovely.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.202
MAN: Sergeant Waldron.

42:01.320 --> 42:02.606
Kate'?

42:06.320 --> 42:08.322
There's no easy way to say this.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.924
This isn't gonna work.

42:12.640 --> 42:15.041
Look, nobody feels worse
about what happened -

42:15.080 --> 42:16.730
what nearly happened -
than I do.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.888
I decide who's right
for my team.

42:18.920 --> 42:21.526
No-one else.
Who can out it and who can't.

42:21.560 --> 42:24.848
It's nothing personal.
You're just not up to the job.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.689
I messed up, but I'll learn.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.041
- I don't give in, skipper.
- Neither do I.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.327
Best you put in for a transfer.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.401
Save me having to turn nasty.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.490
Sorry.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.362
Don't be. It's a free country.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.602
Here you are.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.410
There you go.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.688
So, have you worked
with Jackie long'?

43:17.720 --> 43:19.722
A couple of years, on and off.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.444
And Danny'?

43:22.520 --> 43:23.851
A bit less.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.689
I don't get the impression
there's...

43:25.720 --> 43:27.131
Sorry, Kate. Sorry, listen.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.766
I'm just not feeling
very sociable right now.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.290
No worries.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.923
All right'?

43:39.960 --> 43:41.564
Right. I'd better get in.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.523
See you in a bit.

43:51.080 --> 43:52.889
Look, I'm sorry.

43:54.720 --> 43:57.200
What else can I say to you'?

43:57.240 --> 43:59.242
How do you think
I feel right now'?

43:59.280 --> 44:00.691
Just ignore him.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.927
Ignore him.
Are you taking the piss'?

44:13.000 --> 44:14.490
Thanks.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.850
Finally.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.567
Is that the file on the suspect
shot by Waldron'?

44:20.600 --> 44:21.886
Yeah.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.286
What'?

44:35.440 --> 44:37.727
We need an unredacted file.

44:37.760 --> 44:40.286
Leave it to me.
I'll crack some heads together.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.124
You shouldn't be here.

45:12.160 --> 45:14.640
That only applies
if we're investigating you.

45:14.680 --> 45:17.445
- You're off the hook.
- What do you want'?

45:17.480 --> 45:19.050
You didn't know the suspect?

45:19.080 --> 45:20.366
Oh...

45:21.920 --> 45:23.206
No.

45:23.240 --> 45:26.130
Not heard a rumour about him,
heard the name'?

45:26.160 --> 45:28.367
You need to caution me
before you can ask that.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.323
Like this is on the record.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.169
I just want to know the truth.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.122
The file on Ronan Murphy...

45:40.080 --> 45:41.605
The suspect's name.

45:41.640 --> 45:44.928
...large sections were redacted.

45:44.960 --> 45:47.361
If there's something
bigger here, Danny,

45:47.400 --> 45:50.210
you don't want to be the one
left carrying the can.

45:51.200 --> 45:52.725
Do you run, Steve?

45:52.760 --> 45:54.364
I don't have to.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.209
No-one's chasing me.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.730
I do.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.124
Miles, some nights,
tens of miles.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.242
It gets so
every part of me hurts.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.402
But the one thing I know is,
you keep going through the pain,

46:09.440 --> 46:12.489
because, if you stop,
it's gonna hum a whole lot more

46:12.520 --> 46:14.124
to get started again.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.642
When this is all done, Steve,

46:17.680 --> 46:19.603
I'll suffer for my actions.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.760
I'm under no illusions
of a happy ending.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.602
But I ain't gonna stop.

46:32.280 --> 46:33.770
Danny...

46:34.480 --> 46:36.847
One thing we both know.

46:36.880 --> 46:39.690
The easiest way to get away
with killing someone...

46:39.720 --> 46:41.722
be a police officer.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.804
(Doorbell)

47:02.760 --> 47:04.762
(Dog barks in distance)

47:34.000 --> 47:35.161
(Beeps)

47:36.160 --> 47:37.286
(Beeps)

47:53.360 --> 47:54.646
See you.

47:54.680 --> 47:57.286
Come on. Do you want to have
a go with the light?

47:58.760 --> 48:01.366
Press the button.
Press the button for Daddy.

48:01.400 --> 48:04.768
Won't be long before you're
driving yourself, will it'?

48:04.800 --> 48:07.087
It'll be a few years yet!
Have a good day.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.804
- See you.
- See you later.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.210
Hari.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.486
Ma'am.

48:28.520 --> 48:30.124
Are you all right, Hari'?

48:30.160 --> 48:32.322
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks, guv.

48:32.360 --> 48:35.409
I'm concerned about the unit's
interpersonal dynamics.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.647
So I'm gonna disband
Danny's squad.

48:40.120 --> 48:42.248
What did Danny have to say
about that'?

48:42.280 --> 48:43.691
He won't be the problem.

48:43.720 --> 48:46.246
The problem will be
getting AFOs to work with him.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.446
Well...

48:51.360 --> 48:54.443
He's not the easiest skipper,
but he's good at his job.

48:55.520 --> 48:58.524
I'm learning loads from him.
So I'd rather keep at it.

48:58.560 --> 48:59.846
Seriously?

48:59.880 --> 49:01.166
Yeah.

49:01.200 --> 49:04.727
If you move us on now, ma'am,
then it looks like we messed up.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.285
And we didn't.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.967
Man that is born of a woman
hath but a short time to live

49:19.000 --> 49:21.002
and is full of misery.

49:22.400 --> 49:25.609
He cometh up and is out down,
like a flower.

49:25.640 --> 49:28.246
He fleeth, as it were a shadow,

49:28.280 --> 49:30.886
and never continueth
in one stay.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.604
Let us pray.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.526
Here you are, girl.
Come on, Rosie. Good dog.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.770
There you go.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.451
(Bell pings)

50:09.400 --> 50:10.890
Don't remember me'?

50:13.120 --> 50:15.122
- No.
- No'?

50:15.960 --> 50:18.531
Nor did the man that you buried.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.044
(vans)

50:25.400 --> 50:27.004
(Rosie whines)

50:27.760 --> 50:29.364
Get down.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.609
Sit.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.529
Every time you don't do
what I say, it gets worse.

50:46.840 --> 50:48.649
You'll sit. All right'?

50:50.280 --> 50:51.770
But first...

50:54.760 --> 50:56.842
...you'll take off
all your clothes.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.442
I never knew his name.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.851
Not really.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.842
We did have a name for him,
though.

51:23.320 --> 51:26.927
Se many years I wondered what
I'd do if I ever saw him again.

51:28.200 --> 51:30.009
And then I did.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.327
In a photo, in a briefing room.

51:36.520 --> 51:39.000
And I was being sent to meet him
with a gun.

51:44.120 --> 51:47.249
Before you ask...
this isn't the one.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.882
Illegal. Untraceable.

51:50.920 --> 51:52.922
No problem with using it on you.

52:05.880 --> 52:08.121
So, who was he to you'?

52:08.160 --> 52:09.321
Nephew.

52:12.160 --> 52:14.891
I never knew that there was
a family connection.

52:18.880 --> 52:20.882
We had a name for you, too.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.328
Do you want to know what it was'?

52:26.560 --> 52:28.562
Do you want to know what it was'?

52:28.600 --> 52:30.602
(Laughs)

52:33.920 --> 52:35.524
Oh...

52:39.040 --> 52:41.646
- (Man groans)
- (Chair crashes to floor)

52:48.600 --> 52:51.570
The only thing with Ronan,
it was over too fast.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.247
But I've got you
to make up for that.

53:48.320 --> 53:50.607
Here you go. Here.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.002
(Text alert)

54:31.280 --> 54:32.611
Uh!

54:33.760 --> 54:35.364
(Phone rings)

54:46.080 --> 54:47.889
Sergeant Waldron.

54:47.920 --> 54:49.922
(Siren wails)

54:56.760 --> 55:00.003
- Four Zero, radio check.
- Seven Zero, radio check.

55:00.040 --> 55:03.328
<i>Intel reports no egress
from the premises this morning.</i>

55:03.360 --> 55:06.842
<i>Residents are believed to be

Armed police!

56:02.440 --> 56:04.442
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

56:04.480 --> 56:07.006
- Armed police!
- Nobody move! Armed police!

56:09.520 --> 56:11.807
Armed police!
Show me your hands.

56:11.840 --> 56:14.207
Turn around. Hands behind
your back. Walk to me.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.884
Keep coming.

56:16.920 --> 56:18.490
Move!

56:18.520 --> 56:21.410
Turn around. Hands behind
your back. Behind your back!

56:21.440 --> 56:22.805
To me!

56:22.840 --> 56:24.524
ROD: Move. Move!

56:24.560 --> 56:26.722
Who else is in the house?

56:26.760 --> 56:28.410
No-one.

56:30.920 --> 56:33.048
We're going up.
Call it in, Channel 1.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.082
Victor Charlie Five Five on 1.

56:35.120 --> 56:37.521
<i>Victor Charlie Four One.
Go ahead, Five Five.</i>

56:37.560 --> 56:39.881
Two suspects in custody.
Continuing the search.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.161
Hari, Rod, Jacks, go up.
Kate, stay put.

56:42.200 --> 56:44.407
- I'm good to go up.
- You lot go up.

56:44.440 --> 56:46.044
Back-to-back on 2.

57:01.680 --> 57:03.091
Stay on 1.

57:04.160 --> 57:05.924
Are you really gonna be
like this?

57:05.960 --> 57:08.008
You had your chance
to make this painless.

57:08.040 --> 57:10.281
In the morning,
I'm telling McAndrew

57:10.320 --> 57:12.049
to bump you off the squad.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.889
BAINS: Victor Charlie <i>Five</i> One.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.206
Five One.

57:15.240 --> 57:17.811
BAINS: <i>Five Four. You'd better
come up here, skipper.</i>

57:17.840 --> 57:19.524
On my Way-

57:19.560 --> 57:21.289
Don't move a muscle.

57:21.320 --> 57:22.731
(Cocks gun)

57:37.680 --> 57:38.966
(Gunshot)

57:39.000 --> 57:41.162
- Who else is up there?
- No-one! I told you!

57:41.200 --> 57:43.680
Shot fired! Five Five.
No further information.

57:43.720 --> 57:46.007
<i>- Shot fired!

57:46.040 --> 57:47.849
<i>- What's going on?

57:47.880 --> 57:49.689
<i>Five Five, report.</i>

58:03.240 --> 58:04.924
(Mumbles)

58:04.960 --> 58:07.327
- Officer seriously wounded.
- What happened'?

58:09.400 --> 58:10.526
Shit.

58:12.760 --> 58:14.808
We have a status zero
on one of our officers.

58:14.840 --> 58:16.569
Stay with me, Danny!
Stay with me.

58:18.880 --> 58:20.962
<i>Urgent medical attention
required!</i>

58:21.000 --> 58:22.729

ROD: What's he saying?

58:26.640 --> 58:28.642
<i>We have an officer down.</i>

58:28.680 --> 58:31.286
Stay with me, Danny.
