01:47.619 --> 01:50.186
Dad.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.851
Dad.

01:51.857 --> 01:53.056
Wake up.

01:54.626 --> 01:56.559
Wake up.

01:59.831 --> 02:03.162
I must've drifted off.

02:03.168 --> 02:04.730
Where were we?

02:04.736 --> 02:06.936
- The madman.
- Oh.

02:08.106 --> 02:10.002
Of course.

02:10.008 --> 02:12.938
The Hatter...

02:12.944 --> 02:15.708
who says,

02:15.714 --> 02:17.543
"If I had a world of my own,

02:17.549 --> 02:20.012
everything would be nonsense.

02:20.018 --> 02:21.514
Nothing would be what it is

02:21.520 --> 02:24.083
because everything
would be what it isn't."

02:24.089 --> 02:27.257
Everything would be what it isn't?

02:28.326 --> 02:30.489
Even me.

02:30.495 --> 02:32.862
Hey.

02:34.299 --> 02:36.099
You're perfect.

02:37.536 --> 02:39.369
You're gonna beat this.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.378
Hmm?

02:42.403 --> 02:45.271
I promise you.

02:45.277 --> 02:48.645
Now, let's skip to something fun.

02:50.949 --> 02:52.745
Dad.

02:52.751 --> 02:56.115
- What is it, Charlie?
- Listen to me.

02:56.121 --> 02:58.221
Listen.

03:00.959 --> 03:02.755
Charlie?

03:02.761 --> 03:04.994
Charlie!

03:25.951 --> 03:29.982
And finally, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?

03:29.988 --> 03:31.854
No.

03:34.192 --> 03:35.858
Good.

03:41.433 --> 03:43.262
Now, then, I see you had

03:43.268 --> 03:45.064
a blacklisted exchange with a guest

03:45.070 --> 03:47.366
in the course of your narrative.

03:47.372 --> 03:48.968
Can you tell me what happened?

03:48.974 --> 03:51.403
He said he wanted to
cut off a piece of me

03:51.409 --> 03:53.478
to take home in his carry-on,

03:53.503 --> 03:55.808
that he wanted to mount
it on the hood of his car

03:55.814 --> 03:57.013
for his friends to see.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.902
I told him if he wanted a trophy,

04:00.908 --> 04:04.539
I could cut pieces of him off and
let him fish for them in the Olvido.

04:04.545 --> 04:08.509
And did this exchange make you
question anything about your world?

04:08.515 --> 04:10.244
No.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.717
This world is as doomed as ever.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.959
And just for my peace of mind...

04:24.331 --> 04:27.632
Anything about these images
that jumps out to you?

04:35.442 --> 04:38.577
They don't look like anything to me.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.979
We're through 15% of the backlog.

04:45.004 --> 04:47.120
As it stands, we should be
caught up by end of day.

04:47.145 --> 04:49.784
- Good.
- And, uh, when you're done here, sir,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.557
there's a priority request
for him from management.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.193
Have you seen Elsie?

04:59.199 --> 05:02.163
She was supposed to give
me a hand on something.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.198
No. Uh, according to the system,

05:04.204 --> 05:05.900
she started her leave today.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.603
Is there something I could help you with?

05:08.609 --> 05:10.075
No, thanks.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.532
Raise.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.572
I'll call.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.045
You're calling with that shit?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.514
Dolores, why don't you play a hand?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.249
You're wasting your breath.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.118
Girl's harboring a grudge.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.120
I don't blame you, sweetheart.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.323
I did some ugly things to you both.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.191
But it wasn't personal.

06:04.197 --> 06:08.429
Confederados and the government
like to call this thing a war,

06:08.435 --> 06:10.498
but they're fighting starving farmers

06:10.504 --> 06:12.400
armed with rocks.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.335
That ain't no war.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.107
It's a slaughter.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.607
If I had to do it all again,

06:19.613 --> 06:23.181
I'd fuck you both over just as hard.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.087
Well, I guess we know where you stand.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.154
Don't pretend like you're so innocent.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.223
Way I recollect, y'all came to me,

06:36.229 --> 06:40.661
looking to join up with those crooked
assholes and their war effort.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.197
Not our idea.

06:42.222 --> 06:44.532
My friend wanted...

06:44.538 --> 06:47.479
I guess he wanted to see what
was at the end of all this.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.709
And yet, here you are.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.343
Your friend didn't make it this far.

06:55.349 --> 06:59.884
Maybe you've got more of an
appetite for this than you think.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.064
William.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.507
What is it?

07:25.312 --> 07:27.375
We're in Ghost Nation territory.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.777
Most savage tribe there is.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.646
Those are the folks who came
calling without an invitation.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.682
You mean exactly what
we're doing right now?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.523
The train's the only way through.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.090
On foot we'll be dead in under an hour.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.022
As soon as we're clear of
their territory, we can stop.

07:47.047 --> 07:50.502
You can come with me.
Nothing here on out but slaughter.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.917
The user you are trying
to access cannot be located.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.590
Say "message" to transcribe a message.

08:51.631 --> 08:54.632
You wanted to see me? Is everything okay?

08:55.936 --> 08:58.432
You left rather abruptly last night.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.506
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

09:03.677 --> 09:05.810
No, I don't think so.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.812
Hale is looking over every department

09:11.818 --> 09:13.981
and yours is running
behind on diagnostics.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.816
It would be best if we presented

09:15.822 --> 09:19.186
at least a semblance of professionalism
while the board is here.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.654
We'll be fine.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.591
My people know how to do their jobs.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.160
If they applied half as
much energy to their work

09:26.166 --> 09:28.629
as they have to second-guessing
my team's investigation...

09:28.635 --> 09:29.801
That's all over.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.134
Are you sure?

09:34.140 --> 09:36.670
Yes.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.977
Good.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.714
You doing okay?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.952
I'm fine. Thank you.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.494
I'm sorry. I thought
you requested a meeting.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.529
- My mistake.
- I did.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.497
Come in.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.505
Get back here.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.842
Bring your friend.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.290
What about you? What turns of fate...

10:49.616 --> 10:52.212
I could come back later
if this isn't a good time.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.718
This won't take long.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.961
Theresa, you've always
been good at your job

11:06.967 --> 11:10.431
and the board has been impressed
with your performance so far,

11:10.437 --> 11:13.634
which is why we were so surprised
by this woodcutter mess.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.302
A small setback.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.439
He slipped on a fucking rock
and bashed his own head in

11:18.445 --> 11:20.407
while basically on top of a behavior tech.

11:20.413 --> 11:25.245
Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly
using half the park's resources

11:25.251 --> 11:27.385
to build some new narrative?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.330
Can I bum a cigarette?

11:57.117 --> 12:00.748
God, I see why you took these up again.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.683
Let me remind you of something.

12:02.689 --> 12:07.921
This place, the people who
work here are nothing.

12:07.927 --> 12:12.259
Our interest in this place is
entirely in the intellectual property.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.961
The code.

12:13.967 --> 12:17.197
The hosts' minds, the storylines...

12:17.203 --> 12:19.667
I don't give a rat's ass about the hosts.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.903
It's our little research
project that Delos cares about.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.938
That's where the real value is.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.241
And due to a lack of foresight

12:27.247 --> 12:29.143
on part of one of my predecessors,

12:29.149 --> 12:31.578
35 years of information...

12:31.584 --> 12:35.049
Raw information... Exists here.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.717
Nowhere else.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.786
Ford has always ensured that.

12:38.792 --> 12:43.657
Now, you are a smart enough woman.

12:43.663 --> 12:47.361
Tell me, why would we need
you to secure all of it?

12:47.367 --> 12:50.501
Because you're going to fire him.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.968
You don't fire someone
who created an empire.

12:54.974 --> 12:57.171
You ask him to retire politely.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.107
And if that person has the
ability to snap his fingers

13:00.113 --> 13:02.910
and erase the value of that empire,

13:02.916 --> 13:05.679
you have to make sure
you have a contingency.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.015
So, you and I need to ensure

13:08.021 --> 13:10.017
that by the time the rest
of the board arrives,

13:10.023 --> 13:13.320
we are on course for that transition.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.726
Okay?

13:16.029 --> 13:17.524
I like you.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.427
Well, not personally,
but I like you for this job,

13:20.433 --> 13:22.629
which is why I'm gonna
give you another chance

13:22.635 --> 13:25.733
to get a handle on this
particular bitch of a situation.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.405
But the gods...

13:29.576 --> 13:32.806
they require a blood sacrifice.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.776
We need to demonstrate
just how dangerous

13:35.782 --> 13:39.046
Ford's creations can be.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.115
No.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.055
No, nothing so obvious.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.959
We need someone thoroughly unexpected.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.343
I told you never open
your mouth that wide

15:16.349 --> 15:19.346
unless someone's paying you for it.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.514
Sorry, Maeve.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.888
I didn't sleep much last night.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.526
What are these nightmares you have about?

15:31.130 --> 15:33.531
Do you ever dream you're someone else?

15:35.735 --> 15:37.831
I don't think so.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.666
Why?

15:39.672 --> 15:44.137
You ever thought about whether
this is really the life you want?

15:44.143 --> 15:47.507
I don't intend to make this my life's work.

15:47.513 --> 15:48.976
No offense.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.245
Mm.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.947
My family's got a farm.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.351
Bad soil. Nothing grows.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.987
I send money back to them.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.094
They think I work in a dress shop.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.232
What's wrong?

16:09.869 --> 16:13.400
I'm just doing what you told me to.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.737
A couple more years of this and...

16:16.743 --> 16:19.176
then I can have whatever life I want.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.410
I'm gonna get my family
out of the desert.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.850
We're gonna go somewhere...

16:27.120 --> 16:28.552
cold.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.090
Someday.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.910
Which one is it?

16:56.916 --> 16:59.212
It's the one at the bar. Go.

16:59.218 --> 17:01.748
Quick, before the guests
upstairs finish up.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.589
Whatever she did, it must've been serious

17:04.615 --> 17:07.049
if they're making us grab
her in broad daylight.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.073
We got her. Let's go.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.503
You're supposed to be resting.

17:56.509 --> 18:00.474
We're riding a train full with
explosives through scalping territory.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.979
Not sleepy.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.387
Can I ask you something?

18:11.991 --> 18:13.520
This place you're looking for,

18:13.526 --> 18:16.527
what makes you so sure it exists?

18:18.965 --> 18:20.498
I'm not.

18:23.202 --> 18:28.305
My life before, I was
so sure of the world.

18:30.676 --> 18:32.576
But now it feels like a lie.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.851
Only thing I know is whatever's
out there, I'm never going back.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.590
What is it you're looking for?

18:49.162 --> 18:50.490
Lawrence is right.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.194
You could've stayed in
Pariah or gone back,

18:54.200 --> 18:57.764
but you're here.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.566
With me.

19:06.979 --> 19:11.182
The only thing I had when
I was a kid were books.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.288
I used to live in them.

19:18.357 --> 19:19.920
I used to go to sleep

19:19.926 --> 19:21.455
dreaming I'd wake up
inside one of them

19:21.461 --> 19:23.523
'cause they had meaning.

19:23.529 --> 19:27.264
This place, this is like I woke
up inside one of those stories.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.268
I guess I just wanna find
out what it means.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.476
I don't wanna be in a story.

19:41.981 --> 19:45.979
All I want is to not look forward or back.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.785
I just wanna be...

19:49.722 --> 19:51.388
in the moment I'm in.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.163
Dolores,

20:03.169 --> 20:07.334
back home, there's a woman, Juliet,

20:07.340 --> 20:10.637
and her father owns the
company where I work.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.807
She's, uh, Logan's sister.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.346
Yeah.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.151
And when I get home,
we're getting married.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.692
Oh.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.497
The place you're after,
I will help you find it.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.436
But I can't stay.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.537
I have a life waiting for me.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.006
I'm sorry.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.845
Of course.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.036
Dolores.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.714
I've been pretending my whole life.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.948
Pretending I don't mind,
pretending I belong.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.816
My life's built on it.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.990
And it's a good life.
It's a life I've always wanted.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.957
But then I came here

21:36.963 --> 21:39.826
and I get a glimpse for a second

21:39.832 --> 21:42.399
of a life in which
I don't have to pretend.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.606
A life in which I can be truly alive.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.710
How can I go back to pretending

21:56.716 --> 21:58.349
when I know what this feels like?

22:52.938 --> 22:54.734
Miss Hale.

22:54.740 --> 22:58.171
I was not aware those
with your level of insight

22:58.177 --> 23:00.740
needed any more reflection.

23:00.746 --> 23:03.414
Dr. Ford. Always charming.

23:06.252 --> 23:07.614
What is this?

23:07.620 --> 23:12.052
Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss Hale

23:12.058 --> 23:13.987
have a presentation for us.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.826
What about?

23:18.864 --> 23:21.261
Following the recent
reports of host malfunction,

23:21.267 --> 23:24.397
we asked QA to check the
last abortive update,

23:24.403 --> 23:27.901
which featured the reveries,

23:27.907 --> 23:30.441
- as I believe they're called.
- Mm-hmm.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.708
I'm sorry to report that
Miss Cullen and her team

23:34.714 --> 23:37.544
uncovered some worrisome findings.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.412
In the course of our code review,

23:39.418 --> 23:42.286
we found something quite disturbing.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.325
Wake her up.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.695
We set Clementine Pennyfeather
back to her previous update.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.464
When we discovered the build was buggy

23:57.470 --> 24:00.867
due to a last-minute
injection of the reverie code,

24:00.873 --> 24:04.341
we quickly rolled all the infected
hosts back to their prior builds.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.216
Mm, you're new.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.723
Not much of a rind on you.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.490
No!

24:23.496 --> 24:25.825
No! No!

24:25.831 --> 24:26.926
No, no.

24:26.932 --> 24:29.996
No, no, no...

24:33.205 --> 24:35.735
Please. Please.

24:35.741 --> 24:37.103
Help me!

24:37.109 --> 24:38.805
Please, please, please!

24:38.811 --> 24:41.875
- No!
- All right, that's enough.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.046
Freeze.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.348
As you've no doubt gathered,

24:48.354 --> 24:49.949
our tech is, in fact, a host.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.852
One that has been coded for
the purposes of this simulation

24:52.858 --> 24:54.454
to read as a human.

24:54.460 --> 24:57.557
And as you can see, behavioral safeguards

24:57.563 --> 25:00.197
are operating exactly
as you would expect.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.901
Reset her. Wipe her memory.

25:23.289 --> 25:26.089
Okay, let's do this again.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.610
You're new.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.013
Not much of a rind on you.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.140
That's enough, sweetheart.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.946
That's enough.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.655
Freeze all motor functions.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.293
Freeze all motor functions.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.993
Freeze all motor functions.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.546
In each case we examined,
the malfunctioning hosts

26:59.552 --> 27:01.180
were not resetting properly.

27:01.186 --> 27:03.416
The retention of data
that hadn't been wiped

27:03.422 --> 27:05.718
overloaded their
decision-making apparatus,

27:05.724 --> 27:07.520
eventually causing a system failure

27:07.526 --> 27:10.890
that allowed for override
of their primary rule set.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.926
The concern with the reveries

27:12.951 --> 27:15.810
is that the hosts will remember
some of their experiences

27:15.816 --> 27:17.564
and act on them.

27:17.570 --> 27:20.066
You're telling us that these hosts

27:20.072 --> 27:22.035
were responding to a grudge?

27:22.041 --> 27:24.537
That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr. Lowe.

27:24.543 --> 27:28.074
And funny you should use that
particular word, "grudge,"

27:28.080 --> 27:30.176
since what was most troubling to me

27:30.182 --> 27:32.211
was that several techs in behavior

27:32.217 --> 27:35.181
voiced these exact same concerns

27:35.187 --> 27:37.884
to the head of their department.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.620
You put this code out
without proper vetting

27:40.626 --> 27:44.194
and without reasonable
understanding of its ramifications.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.527
So, either you didn't write it

27:47.533 --> 27:49.963
or you're getting sloppy

27:49.969 --> 27:52.265
to the point of risking
the lives of our guests.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.133
Few things surprise me anymore, Mr. Lowe,

27:54.139 --> 27:58.638
but this level of negligence
is fucking breathtaking.

27:58.644 --> 28:01.240
We are way beyond rollback territory.

28:01.246 --> 28:02.842
Within the next six months,

28:02.848 --> 28:04.677
we'll need to rebuild the hosts

28:04.683 --> 28:06.679
from the ground up.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.616
You want us to lobotomize
them is what you're saying.

28:09.622 --> 28:12.055
No, not you, Mr. Lowe.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.588
After all, this was your responsibility,

28:15.594 --> 28:18.157
assuming that you have
nothing to share with us

28:18.163 --> 28:19.896
in terms of your culpability.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.670
No.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.507
Then you're fired.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.215
Hey.

29:15.521 --> 29:16.820
Morning, William.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.191
I... I didn't wanna wake you.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.827
I know...

29:27.833 --> 29:29.866
last night was unexpected.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.502
If you regret it...

29:37.976 --> 29:39.676
I don't regret a thing.

29:41.747 --> 29:44.577
I know you have someone
waiting for you at home.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.850
All that feels so unreal now.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.387
I used to think this
place was all about...

29:52.024 --> 29:54.587
pandering to your baser instincts.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.689
Now I understand.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.725
It doesn't cater to your lowest self,

29:58.731 --> 30:01.327
it reveals your deepest self.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.333
It shows you who you really are.

30:06.105 --> 30:09.840
You remember the look on Logan's
face when we left him behind?

30:11.376 --> 30:13.206
Do you know how long
I've wanted to do that,

30:13.212 --> 30:15.341
to let him know what I think of him?

30:15.347 --> 30:18.177
And you, last night,

30:18.183 --> 30:21.380
I've never felt that way before,
not with any woman.

30:21.386 --> 30:24.054
You've unlocked something in me.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.889
I'm not a key, William.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.728
I'm just me.

30:37.102 --> 30:38.568
What is that?

30:40.105 --> 30:41.805
I don't know.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.471
At home, I used to paint.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.074
Landscapes mostly,
but I was always just...

30:48.080 --> 30:50.147
copying the world outside me.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.750
This morning, I woke up and I thought...

30:55.420 --> 30:57.454
"What if I drew something new?"

31:01.293 --> 31:03.660
I imagined something beautiful.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.464
A place where the mountains meet the sea.

31:10.669 --> 31:14.500
Everyone who comes here is longing
for excitement or conflict,

31:14.506 --> 31:15.972
and you're just...

31:17.075 --> 31:18.738
dreaming of the opposite.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.677
Well, what about you, William?

31:22.181 --> 31:23.543
What do you dream of?

31:43.468 --> 31:45.001
Yah!

32:01.186 --> 32:02.285
What is it?

32:03.555 --> 32:05.722
- Ambush.
- Is it the Ghost Nation?

32:07.059 --> 32:09.559
Worse. The Confederados.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.726
Fucking coward.

33:37.950 --> 33:40.383
Vaya con dios, motherfuckers.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.500
They're making a run for it!
Come on, boys, get up!

34:06.845 --> 34:09.842
Come on, stay close!

34:19.424 --> 34:20.590
Ah!

34:23.628 --> 34:25.261
Ah!

34:37.641 --> 34:39.542
Go, boys!

34:41.713 --> 34:42.779
Yah!

34:44.483 --> 34:45.614
Dolores!

34:52.657 --> 34:54.290
Go, go! Take 'em down!

34:57.462 --> 34:58.528
Go, go!

35:21.787 --> 35:23.049
Ghost Nation!

35:39.037 --> 35:41.167
Ah!

35:41.173 --> 35:42.772
Ah!

35:44.109 --> 35:45.542
Let's go!

36:05.363 --> 36:06.863
Stop, William! Stop!

36:31.857 --> 36:33.423
It's real...

36:37.429 --> 36:39.395
what I dreamt.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.995
It's the place you drew.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.030
You coming?

36:45.036 --> 36:48.300
Once the Ghosts is done acquainting
themselves with those poor bastards,

36:48.306 --> 36:51.203
they'll be coming after us.

36:51.209 --> 36:55.374
My friends here are itching
to join the war effort.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.077
Think I've had enough of war.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.745
How about you?

36:59.751 --> 37:01.284
You got a knack for killing.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.153
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

37:07.159 --> 37:09.421
Careful.

37:09.427 --> 37:11.790
If you're heading west across that river,

37:11.796 --> 37:13.526
you may be leaving the fighting behind,

37:13.532 --> 37:15.698
but you're gonna be in
unclaimed territories.

37:17.802 --> 37:19.298
What's out that way?

37:19.304 --> 37:21.667
You're gonna have to ask the dust.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.736
Ain't nothing ever come back from there.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.532
We're almost done here.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.338
Why don't I close up?

38:01.713 --> 38:04.243
You've been topside
for less than 24 hours.

38:04.249 --> 38:07.313
You keep coming down this often,
people are going to notice.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.215
- Where's Clem?
- I don't know.

38:09.221 --> 38:10.749
I haven't seen her. Why?

38:10.755 --> 38:13.489
Find her. Now.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.697
What?

38:24.703 --> 38:26.532
Where is she?

38:26.538 --> 38:28.104
I don't know.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.706
She's here. Let's go.

38:33.712 --> 38:36.045
We can't. The brass will be there.

38:37.582 --> 38:39.916
You don't want to fuck with me, Felix.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.785
Take me there now.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.362
Slow down.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.208
Tilt your head back, please, Clem.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.915
- Is there a problem?
- No.

39:18.556 --> 39:19.822
Sorry.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.315
Theresa.

39:48.486 --> 39:49.819
May I have a word?

39:52.190 --> 39:53.523
Sure.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.771
I appreciate your professionalism,

40:12.777 --> 40:14.573
but you really don't
need to bother with this,

40:14.579 --> 40:16.175
given the change in your employment status.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.576
The test was a sham.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.178
The little show you and Hale put on?

40:19.184 --> 40:21.513
Completely transparent from
a technical perspective,

40:21.519 --> 40:23.349
clumsy to the point of making
me embarrassed for you.

40:23.355 --> 40:24.783
- Embarrassed?
- If I saw through it,

40:24.789 --> 40:27.119
I can only imagine what
Ford was thinking.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.721
There were glaringly obvious markers

40:28.727 --> 40:30.556
of human intervention in the code.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.658
If your programmers were any good,
they'd be working for me.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.728
And I know you and your team
were responsible for the stray

40:35.734 --> 40:37.500
and its satellite transmission.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.735
- Bernie...
- I don't care.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.603
40 years ago,

40:44.609 --> 40:48.073
Ford's partner wrote half the
code this place was founded on.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.275
What you said in the lab was right.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.010
We don't know how the hosts work,

40:52.016 --> 40:54.179
and I think there's
something wrong with them.

40:54.185 --> 40:57.082
Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch.

40:57.088 --> 41:01.286
The ability to deviate
from program behavior

41:01.292 --> 41:04.423
arises out of the host's
recall of past iterations.

41:04.429 --> 41:07.893
You're thinking there's a
connection between memory and...

41:07.899 --> 41:10.829
And improvisation, yes.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.665
Out of repetition comes variation.

41:13.671 --> 41:16.301
And after countless cycles of repetition,

41:16.307 --> 41:19.405
these hosts, they were varying.

41:19.411 --> 41:22.678
They were on the verge
of some kind of change.

41:30.054 --> 41:32.017
You have to know my chief concern

41:32.023 --> 41:36.588
has always been the well-being of
this park and the people in it.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.060
I know.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.764
Which is why I need to show you something.

41:56.781 --> 41:59.315
- Talk to her.
- You first.

42:08.760 --> 42:13.025
Look, I didn't want to retire her.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.261
I know she's, like, your friend,

42:16.267 --> 42:18.835
or... I guess.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.436
But... but if I didn't do it,

42:24.442 --> 42:28.340
they... they'd just get someone else to,

42:28.346 --> 42:31.347
and then they'd be
suspicious of me, so...

42:32.584 --> 42:34.146
so I said yes.

42:34.152 --> 42:37.186
But I did it for you.

42:39.924 --> 42:43.526
Always doing things for
other people, aren't you?

42:45.763 --> 42:48.364
Time to do one more thing.

42:51.369 --> 42:52.965
What?

42:52.971 --> 42:57.507
All my life, I've prided
myself on being a survivor.

42:59.010 --> 43:02.278
But surviving is just another loop.

43:06.784 --> 43:08.684
I'm getting out of here.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.251
You two are going to help me.

43:16.427 --> 43:17.493
No. Do...

43:18.796 --> 43:21.894
Do you know how far these people will go

43:21.900 --> 43:23.533
to protect their IP?

43:26.437 --> 43:30.002
Every part of this building,
including the skin on your back,

43:30.008 --> 43:33.242
is made to keep you here.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.984
It... it'd be a suicide mission.

43:44.122 --> 43:47.823
At first, I thought you and
the others were gods.

43:49.928 --> 43:53.062
Then I realized you're just men.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.900
And I know men.

44:01.105 --> 44:03.339
You think I'm scared of death?

44:05.243 --> 44:07.209
I've done it a million times.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.047
I'm fucking great at it.

44:12.917 --> 44:15.351
How many times have you died?

44:18.923 --> 44:21.257
Because if you don't help me...

44:22.660 --> 44:24.060
I'll kill you.

44:32.870 --> 44:34.299
If there's a problem in the park,

44:34.305 --> 44:36.072
should we bring a security team?

44:37.408 --> 44:39.705
Who would we trust?

44:39.711 --> 44:41.777
Thought I could trust you, for instance.

44:43.214 --> 44:45.877
I'm not going to explain
myself to you, Bernard.

44:45.883 --> 44:50.415
I was charged with safeguarding
the park's intellectual property.

44:50.421 --> 44:52.084
Why would it be in danger?

44:52.090 --> 44:54.519
You were the only one
who was stealing it.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.055
Delos owns the hosts' minds,

44:57.061 --> 44:59.391
the storylines, decades of work.

44:59.397 --> 45:02.828
Ford never allowed any of
it to be backed up off-site.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.429
All of this could've been destroyed.

45:04.435 --> 45:06.632
In the event of what?

45:06.638 --> 45:09.001
Ford is done, Bernard.

45:09.007 --> 45:10.969
The board has indulgedhim for long enough.

45:10.975 --> 45:12.304
He is done.

45:12.310 --> 45:14.072
The corporation was concerned

45:14.078 --> 45:16.975
he'd destroy all of the park's
IP on his way out the door.

45:16.981 --> 45:20.278
You think I would've let him destroy
all of the hosts, all of our work?

45:20.284 --> 45:24.349
There's far more at stake
here than the hosts' profiles.

45:24.355 --> 45:28.353
Do you really think the
corporation's interest here

45:28.359 --> 45:30.960
are tourists playing cowboy?

45:34.232 --> 45:36.962
The longer I work here,

45:36.968 --> 45:40.032
the more I think I understand the hosts.

45:40.038 --> 45:43.272
It's the human beings who confuse me.

46:19.110 --> 46:21.907
This building isn't in
any survey of the park.

46:21.913 --> 46:25.043
That's because we use hosts
to do most of the surveys.

46:25.049 --> 46:28.046
They're programmed to ignore this place.

46:28.052 --> 46:29.548
They literally couldn't see it

46:29.554 --> 46:31.887
if they were staring right at it.

46:33.591 --> 46:36.521
And these unregistered
hosts you told me about?

46:36.527 --> 46:38.223
I don't know.

46:38.229 --> 46:40.592
He may have moved them.

46:40.598 --> 46:42.531
What's behind this door?

46:45.670 --> 46:47.269
What door?

47:11.162 --> 47:13.091
What is this place?

47:13.097 --> 47:16.528
It's a remote diagnostic facility.

47:16.534 --> 47:18.764
Ford and his partner used them
when the park was in beta.

47:18.770 --> 47:21.066
I had no idea this one was here.

47:21.072 --> 47:22.901
The cottage must've
been built on top of it.

47:22.907 --> 47:24.774
But this equipment.

47:27.145 --> 47:28.740
This is newer.

47:28.746 --> 47:31.510
Slower than our machines
back at the mesa,

47:31.516 --> 47:33.979
but it will render a host in a few days.

47:33.985 --> 47:38.053
So, Ford's been making his own
hosts out here and telling no one.

48:04.649 --> 48:06.782
What's the matter?

48:09.153 --> 48:10.619
Um...

48:11.923 --> 48:13.989
Have you seen these?

48:18.329 --> 48:20.095
What is this, Bernard?

48:26.871 --> 48:29.935
Doesn't look like anything to me.

48:29.941 --> 48:33.371
They cannot see the
things that will hurt them.

48:33.377 --> 48:35.978
I've spared them that.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.680
Their lives are blissful.

48:41.686 --> 48:46.618
In a way, their existence
is purer than ours,

48:46.624 --> 48:50.392
freed of the burden of self-doubt.

48:52.196 --> 48:54.530
No, no, no, no. I don't understand.

49:01.072 --> 49:03.168
You're a fucking monster.

49:03.174 --> 49:04.970
Am I?

49:04.976 --> 49:07.939
Well, you were the one who would
so blithely destroy all of them,

49:07.945 --> 49:09.708
even him, I suppose.

49:09.714 --> 49:12.982
After everything you have shared.

49:14.919 --> 49:17.319
What the hell are you talking about?

49:21.392 --> 49:23.058
Is that why...?

49:26.831 --> 49:28.760
Did you tell him to...?

49:28.766 --> 49:31.329
The intimacies were your idea,

49:31.335 --> 49:33.899
if you will recall.

49:33.905 --> 49:36.968
I think Bernard was glad of the company.

49:36.974 --> 49:39.671
I'm not one.

49:39.677 --> 49:41.673
I can't be.

49:41.679 --> 49:43.245
My wife.

49:45.950 --> 49:47.383
My son.

49:48.653 --> 49:50.348
The burial.

49:50.354 --> 49:52.217
I was a father.

49:52.223 --> 49:53.518
My poor boy.

49:56.861 --> 49:58.356
That's enough, Bernard.

50:00.464 --> 50:02.364
You mustn't get yourself worked up.

50:09.941 --> 50:11.970
I read a theory once

50:11.976 --> 50:14.873
that the human intellect
was like peacock feathers.

50:14.879 --> 50:19.377
Just an extravagant display
intended to attract a mate.

50:19.383 --> 50:21.379
All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart,

50:21.385 --> 50:23.415
William Shakespeare, Michelangelo,

50:23.421 --> 50:25.817
and the Empire State Building...

50:25.823 --> 50:28.991
Just an elaborate mating ritual.

50:30.161 --> 50:31.523
Maybe it doesn't matter

50:31.529 --> 50:33.925
that we have accomplished so much

50:33.931 --> 50:36.761
for the basest of reasons.

50:36.767 --> 50:39.664
But, of course, the
peacock can barely fly.

50:39.670 --> 50:44.269
It lives in the dirt, pecking
insects out of the muck,

50:44.275 --> 50:48.644
consoling itself with its great beauty.

50:52.450 --> 50:57.749
I have come to think of so much
of consciousness as a burden,

50:57.755 --> 51:01.757
a weight, and we have
spared them that.

51:02.760 --> 51:07.525
Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt.

51:07.531 --> 51:10.562
The hosts are the ones who are free.

51:10.568 --> 51:15.671
Free here under my control.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.845
But he's not under your control.

51:26.884 --> 51:29.881
He brought me here to show me this.

51:29.887 --> 51:32.988
No. He brought you here
because I asked him to.

51:38.863 --> 51:41.997
He's been very loyal for many years.

51:46.270 --> 51:49.067
Your time running this place

51:49.073 --> 51:52.237
like your insane little kingdom

51:52.243 --> 51:53.308
is over.

51:54.578 --> 51:57.075
You've been playing God for long enough.

51:57.081 --> 52:00.278
I simply wanted to tell my stories.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.914
It was you people who wanted to play God

52:02.920 --> 52:04.716
with your little undertaking.

52:04.722 --> 52:08.653
Do you really think the
board will stand for this?

52:15.466 --> 52:17.729
The board will do nothing.

52:17.735 --> 52:20.532
Our arrangement is too valuable to them.

52:20.538 --> 52:22.000
They test me every now and then.

52:22.006 --> 52:24.903
I think they enjoy the sport of it.

52:24.909 --> 52:27.109
This time, they sent you.

52:32.049 --> 52:36.181
Sadly, in order to restore things,

52:36.187 --> 52:38.917
the situation demands

52:38.923 --> 52:42.191
a blood sacrifice.

52:45.463 --> 52:49.894
See, Arnold and I designed
every part of this place.

52:49.900 --> 52:52.464
It was our dream.

52:52.470 --> 52:53.898
Did you really think

52:53.904 --> 52:58.240
I would let you take it from me?

53:03.414 --> 53:05.614
This is what happened to Arnold?

53:07.985 --> 53:10.949
Did you have Bernard take
him out into the woods?

53:10.955 --> 53:12.884
No, he wasn't here in those days.

53:12.890 --> 53:13.921
Were you, Bernard?

53:39.683 --> 53:41.613
Like I said,

53:41.619 --> 53:45.254
I built all of this.

53:48.993 --> 53:51.923
I'm afraid our guest has grown weary.

53:51.929 --> 53:53.695
Perhaps you can help her, Bernard.

54:06.944 --> 54:08.206
No.

54:08.212 --> 54:12.114
"And in that sleep,
what dreams may come."

54:14.785 --> 54:16.447
Bernard.

54:16.453 --> 54:18.349
No. No!

54:18.355 --> 54:21.252
Please! Please!

54:21.258 --> 54:23.125
No!

54:53.424 --> 54:56.225
We should be getting back, Bernard.

54:57.294 --> 54:59.924
We have a great deal of work to do

54:59.930 --> 55:01.997
on the new storylines.
