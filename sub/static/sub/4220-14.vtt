WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:04.754
I mean, what the hell
is a couple more months
if I'm too sick to enjoy it?

00:04.838 --> 00:07.090
Pop, you have got to keep
taking your pills.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.508
I wanna go out
on my own terms.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.843
We're gonna throw a party.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.721
Do you mind if I borrow
Kelly for an hour?
What for?

00:13.806 --> 00:14.847
Intimidation.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.600
Please accept my condolences
on the loss of your paramedic.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.310
Her name was Shay, right?

00:19.770 --> 00:24.148
Unfortunately, OFI has
decided not to pursue Adrian
Gish at this time.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.693
But we found the guy,
and he all but admitted it.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.903
I wish I could give
you a different answer
but I can't.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.046
Hey, Lieutenant,
Captain Cunningham here.

00:47.131 --> 00:48.756
Call me.
I need to talk to you.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.560
Phew!

01:07.025 --> 01:08.401
Damn!

01:14.491 --> 01:15.825
Wow.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.909
Cold enough for you,
Lieutenant?

01:16.994 --> 01:19.787
Yeah, I just saw
a penguin crying.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.334
Engine's busted. Or froze.

01:26.378 --> 01:30.256
I mean, Fleet Management's
jammed up so I asked Capp
to take a look.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.092
Let me guess. He upgraded
you to the full-service
package.

01:33.177 --> 01:37.013
He started going on about
the air filter, and then
the fuel intake,

01:37.139 --> 01:38.347
and next thing you know...

01:38.432 --> 01:41.684
Ah! Damn it!
What the hell was that?

01:41.810 --> 01:44.687
Relax! I got a handle on it!

01:44.855 --> 01:45.938
Roll call in five.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.191
Yep. You hear that, Cooter?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.361
Dukes of Hazzard.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.364
You guys suck.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.993
We have a bona fide
weather emergency.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.787
Temperatures are down
to below 15.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.622
Wind chill brings
that to under 40.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.957
Cold weather
has knocked out the servers
at the alarm office.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.709
911 is down.

02:06.919 --> 02:11.464
It is war out there and we
have got to be prepared.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.966
Motorized tools,
silver-bullets,

02:14.051 --> 02:16.010
anything that can freeze
needs to be protected.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.929
Ten minutes exposed
is ten minutes too long.

02:18.013 --> 02:21.224
It's us against the raving
bitch side of Chicago.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.184
I expect us all
to hold our own.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.936
You all are dismissed.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.981
Hey, come on, Cruz.
Up and at 'em.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.067
Forty below
with the wind chill?

02:31.735 --> 02:34.987
That means that it's cold
as it is at zero degrees.
And that's pretty damn cold.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.532
It is forty degrees colder
than that.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.160
Are you okay?
No, I'm not.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.329
Human beings shouldn't
live like this.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.374
Oh, actually, when Baba was
growing up in Yakutsk, it...

02:46.458 --> 02:49.085
I am not talking
about your Baba!

02:50.254 --> 02:53.506
I barely survived
my last Chicago winter.
One more might kill me.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.601
Got room for this?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.023
Take that one.
Start salting the driveway.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.276
Yes, sir.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.240
You don't need
to call me that.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.659
Are you gonna keep calling
me candidate?

03:21.743 --> 03:23.536
Only if you royally screw up.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.121
Fair enough.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.957
All right.
Keep covered.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.543
Got a frostbite warning
in effect. That's no joke.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.714
All right.
Equipment's protected.
Compartments are dry.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.800
We've got enough salt to melt
the polar ice caps.

03:39.094 --> 03:42.388
Matt! Call Brett and Mills!
We gotta check her
for hypothermia.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.056
Check who?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.684
The baby I just found outside.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.908
Okay. Aw. She's warming up.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.537
Heart rate's stable.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.081
No signs of frostbite.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.584
She couldn't have been
out there long.
Where'd you find her?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.836
On the apron, under the
"Safe Haven" sign.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.379
Any sign of who left her?

04:15.672 --> 04:18.883
It doesn't matter
who left her.
"Safe Haven" means just that.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.552
No questions asked.
Right, Chief?

04:21.970 --> 04:25.097
Absolutely.
What matters is she is here
with us now.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.350
Our job is to get
her the best care
that she can get.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.227
So, let's bring her over
to Chicago Med.
I'll call DCFS.

04:30.312 --> 04:33.147
Although I don't know
we'll be taking her anywhere
anytime soon.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.316
That ambo's laid up.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.487
I'm making some serious
headway.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.655
Get it done.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.074
Now, in the meantime,

04:43.867 --> 04:46.661
I have some diapers, wipes,
formula in the truck.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.871
Get it over.
Will do, Chief.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.289
Aw.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.378
All right. Uh-oh, our little
guest smells kind of ripe.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.964
Might need a change.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.049
I'll do it.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.301
You sure?
Absolutely.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.303
I used to help my brother
with his kids.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.556
And I can change a diaper
blindfolded if I had to.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.475
Aw.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.062
Good morning.

05:15.941 --> 05:16.983
Morning.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.734
You got a minute to talk?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.027
About?

05:21.196 --> 05:22.405
Briefing room.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.704
I hear Police Intelligence
took down your arsonist.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.039
Head-shot, right?

05:32.124 --> 05:33.124
Right.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.584
Must be one hell
of a story.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.337
Are you fishing for details,

05:38.422 --> 05:41.924
or are you just raw
that someone did the job
you weren't willing to do?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.635
Captain.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.849
I need your eyes on something.

05:51.601 --> 05:56.188
Electrical fire
sparked by a short
in the computer server.

05:56.273 --> 06:00.109
Ceiling collapse nearly
took out the first company
on the scene.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.069
Yeah. I heard about it.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.906
Fire suppression system
malfunctioned. Convenient.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.494
Figure there's something in
these boxes that someone
wanted to burn, but

06:11.288 --> 06:14.999
deadline to file's coming up
and I got nothing more
to go on.

06:16.168 --> 06:19.420
This is...
This is unbelievable.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.757
Are you seriously asking me
to help you out of a jam?
Again?

06:26.303 --> 06:29.346
I get that you don't
want to do me any favors.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.640
You're entitled
to that anger.

06:31.767 --> 06:35.394
But out of respect
for the firefighters
who almost lost their lives,

06:37.022 --> 06:41.025
maybe you can pull
your head out of your ass
and help us out.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.867
Phew!

06:51.119 --> 06:53.412
Well-digger's ass out there.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.707
Pops, what, what are you
doing here?

06:57.167 --> 06:58.501
Terrance is napping.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.963
And cold or no cold,
I don't wanna spend my last
few days in Chicago

07:03.090 --> 07:04.799
staring at the same
four walls.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.093
So I thought I'd come
to where the action is.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.012
Pops, I'm glad you came.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.724
Something I need you to see.
Come on.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.938
"Advanced T-Cell
Replacement Clinic"

07:19.189 --> 07:21.357
30 subjects.
Twelve went into remission.

07:22.526 --> 07:23.651
Yeah, I see that.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.862
Those are fighting
numbers, Pops.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.531
Now, I've already sent
your charts

07:28.615 --> 07:31.534
and they say that you are
an ideal candidate
for their next study.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.701
Wallace!

07:33.120 --> 07:36.747
Pops, this is a chance

07:37.040 --> 07:39.875
for you to see
little Terrance walk
on his two feet.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.503
This is a chance
for him to know your name.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.006
A chance, a chance, a chance.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.135
Just stop, okay?

07:50.679 --> 07:52.847
I was a cop for thirty years.

07:53.306 --> 07:57.226
Fought for my life more times
than you could know.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.230
But I'm on the other side
of all of that stuff.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.650
It's down to my terms now.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.862
You know how rare that is?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.447
Especially in our lines
of work.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.408
What are you saying
to me, Pops?

08:12.909 --> 08:13.993
Just gonna give up?

08:14.077 --> 08:15.536
No! No, no.

08:15.704 --> 08:19.957
I just wanna cut loose.
Celebrate. Live!

08:21.209 --> 08:22.626
Which reminds me.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.421
What's going on
with the party planning?

08:25.755 --> 08:29.175
Pops, please look
at the thing.

08:29.259 --> 08:33.596
No! I won't do it.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.143
Now, if you've got a problem
with that I'm very happy

08:39.603 --> 08:41.353
to jump back on a plane
to Orlando.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.440
It's all right.
It's okay.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.617
Here.
This will warm you up.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.369
Hey, has anyone
seen Newhouse
around lately?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.538
Yeah, he had
a few weeks
furlough accrued.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.499
Took his daughter
to San Diego to meet
some relatives.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.086
Are you serious?
He really did it?

09:06.296 --> 09:08.172
He actually got out
of this icy hell?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.966
That's my understanding.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.346
See, that is boldness.
That's a hero right there.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.640
You okay, Cruz?
Mmm-hmm.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.642
What are you doing?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.894
I am looking for flights
out of here.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.312
To San Diego?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.564
San Diego, or anywhere
where your spit
doesn't freeze

09:25.649 --> 09:27.107
immediately inside
of your mouth.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.359
Ugh.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.571
Ah, there she is!

09:32.864 --> 09:34.657
Fresh as a daisy.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.700
Aw!

09:36.993 --> 09:39.662
Look at that face.
Hi.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.583
What kind of person abandons
their baby outside on a day
like this anyway?

09:44.668 --> 09:46.001
Well, she's safe now.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.419
Aren't you, cutie,
huh?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.798
I'll be right back.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.677
Okay, try it again!

09:54.761 --> 09:55.803
How's it going?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.349
I'm gonna assume
that question's rhetorical.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.019
Have you guys tried turning
the key really slow?

10:04.813 --> 10:07.273
I know whenever we had
a big cold front back
in Fowlerton it really...

10:07.357 --> 10:10.484
Brett, I pulled the whole
damn engine apart.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.028
And It's not gonna be a
quick flip of the...

10:14.072 --> 10:17.574
Oh! Hey! Oh!

10:19.077 --> 10:21.537
What the...
Uh-uh-uh. I told you.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.788
There's a child in the house.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.207
If you're gonna swear,
go outside.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.710
Up and running?
Yeah, Good to go.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.753
All right.
I'll grab some
extra blankets.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.381
Let's get this baby
to Chicago Med.
All right.

10:32.590 --> 10:37.219
Ambo 61. Am...
61, come in. Come in, Ambo 61.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.471
Yeah, go for 61.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.018
Getting too much interference.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.770
Everybody is relying on radios
with 911 down.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.147
Probably overloading
the channels.

10:48.231 --> 10:51.317
Chest pains.
Diversey and Kenton. Report.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.776
What is he saying?
Diversey and Kenton?

10:52.861 --> 10:53.902
It's chest pains.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.406
I mean, it should be a quick
grab, drop. We can transport
the baby afterwards.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.116
Yeah, hit it.
Yeah?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.617
I'll tell Boden.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.621
Yeah, we got this, man.
61, on our way.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.957
Copy that,
Ambo 61...

11:07.083 --> 11:08.500
Hey!

11:12.464 --> 11:14.757
Excuse me, excuse me,
you work here?
Yeah.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.344
Everything all right?
No, no. It's not.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.681
Dawson?
Oh! Oh, my God, Grace!

11:22.766 --> 11:24.224
There she is!
What's going on?

11:24.726 --> 11:27.853
That's my baby.
I want her back.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.361
Take a seat.
Um...

11:35.612 --> 11:37.654
We're gonna work
this out, okay?

11:38.365 --> 11:41.784
What's going on here?
Uh, this woman
is claiming that...

11:41.868 --> 11:43.494
I'm not, I'm not
claiming nothing.

11:43.578 --> 11:46.038
I'm telling you
that that's my baby girl.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.458
How did your baby end up
outside of our firehouse,
ma'am?

11:49.793 --> 11:52.336
Her father, Miles,
who's a, a deadbeat,

11:52.420 --> 11:53.670
he came by my place
this morning

11:53.755 --> 11:55.881
and he tried to say
that Grace wasn't his.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.468
Dropping her here, this is
his way of trying to get
rid of her for good.

11:59.594 --> 12:00.803
What's your name?

12:01.262 --> 12:04.640
Uh, um, Toni. Toni Jessup.
You can look it up.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.228
I knew Miles was tripping
but I never thought he'd try
something like this.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.773
I mean, she is my baby.
He has no right giving
her up like that.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.568
What color was the blanket
Grace was wrapped in?

12:17.779 --> 12:21.657
Um... Uh, it was blue
with, uh, with gray checks.

12:22.033 --> 12:25.869
And, um, and she had this
mismatched socks
on this morning

12:25.995 --> 12:28.539
because it was too cold
to go to the laundromat.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.836
Well, we're gonna
need approval

12:33.962 --> 12:35.712
from the Department of
Children and Family Services

12:35.797 --> 12:37.589
before we can release
this child back to you.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.760
But that's not right!
She's my baby!

12:41.845 --> 12:43.512
I understand your
frustration, ma'am.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.723
The system exists to protect
you and the child.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.518
My best advice,
you come back with some
proper documentation.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.644
We'll go from there.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.939
Okay. I'll be back then.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.655
Can I, can I see her please?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.209
That's my baby.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.504
Okay.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.632
Okay.
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.219
I'll call the DCFS,
give them an update.

13:27.223 --> 13:31.643
Chief, who's to say
this boyfriend won't try
to ditch the baby again?

13:32.729 --> 13:35.022
What if he tries something
worse next time?

13:36.065 --> 13:37.566
That's not our call.

13:44.115 --> 13:48.202
Hey! Over here! This way!
Hurry!

13:49.954 --> 13:50.954
This way.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.543
He needs help.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.420
You called us in?
Somebody with chest pains?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.672
Chest pains? I don't know.
Maybe.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.508
Seems like
that's the least
of this kid's problems.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.885
Please, somebody help me
get these bugs out of here?
Hey! Hey!

14:04.969 --> 14:06.303
Sit down, buddy.
Come on,

14:06.763 --> 14:07.846
What's your name, huh?

14:07.931 --> 14:09.723
What's your name?
Chris. Chris.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.684
Okay, Chris.
Please! Hurry!

14:13.186 --> 14:16.271
Okay, we're gonna do our best,
but you gotta help us out.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.898
What was it you took?
Uh...

14:18.024 --> 14:21.109
PCP? Molly?
No, no. no.
We just smoked some weed.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.986
Hold on. What do you
mean, "we"?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.864
Hey, Brett, look.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.700
Okay, Chris.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.244
Keep warm.
I need you to focus!

14:30.328 --> 14:31.453
Who was with you?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.832
It was my girlfriend.
My girlfriend, Celia.
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!

14:35.959 --> 14:38.710
She and I were sharing
a blunt, and then she freaked
and she ran

14:38.795 --> 14:41.797
and I tried to stop her,
but I can't.
It's these damned bugs!

14:42.215 --> 14:43.715
Look, the footprints
are leading into there.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.387
This building's not heated.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.181
That girl's gonna freeze
to death if she doesn't
have the right gear.

14:52.183 --> 14:55.352
61 to main.
We got a second victim
at Diversey and Kenton.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.688
We're gonna need a second
ambo here for assist.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.067
Hey, Brett! Wait! Where, where
are you going?

15:02.485 --> 15:04.611
Well, you take care of him.
I'll, I'll look for the girl.

15:07.782 --> 15:08.991
Come on.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.327
Celia?

15:19.502 --> 15:22.671
Celia? Can you hear me?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.513
How's Grace?

15:32.223 --> 15:34.474
Good. What's the latest?

15:35.184 --> 15:39.354
DCFS is tied up. 911
being down has brought
everything to a standstill.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.106
They told me they'd call
back in an hour.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.734
Well, I guess it's a blessing.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.862
This firehouse is probably
the most stable environment
she's ever known.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.161
You wanna hold her?

15:54.787 --> 15:55.787
Yeah.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.497
Sure?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.416
Just watch the back
of her head.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.466
Like this?
Yeah. There you go.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.756
Yeah, Captain Cunningham,
please.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.594
Main, this is ambulance 61
checking in again.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.807
Please confirm that backup
is on its way
to Diversey and Kenton.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.646
Confirmed...
61 at Divers... Kenzie.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.774
No! Not, not Kenzie! Ken-ton!

17:12.198 --> 17:13.615
Hey, Brett! Do you copy?

17:16.911 --> 17:17.911
Brett?

17:25.086 --> 17:26.378
Celia?

17:29.632 --> 17:33.802
Brett?
Can you hear me?
Brett, come in.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.137
Hello?

17:38.474 --> 17:39.474
Mills?

17:47.150 --> 17:48.984
Oh, shoot!

17:56.617 --> 17:57.909
Stay there!
What do you want?

17:57.994 --> 18:00.495
I don't want anything.
I'm just trying to help!

18:00.997 --> 18:02.247
What happened to your face?

18:02.832 --> 18:04.958
A girl, she attacked me.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.710
When?
Which direction did she go?

18:13.676 --> 18:14.676
Okay, here.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.554
Take these hand warmers.
Go outside.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.390
Find the ambulance
that's waiting there. And tell
my partner where I am.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.934
He'll take care of you.
And hurry.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.692
Boo!

18:31.319 --> 18:34.529
Dawson, this is
Doctor Pierson.

18:34.697 --> 18:38.241
She's our pediatrician.
She was kind enough to come on
by and check on Grace.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.035
She's a beautiful girl.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.872
Do you mind
raising her a bit?
Oh! Sure.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.999
Let's take a look.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.709
Uh, we checked
her vitals earlier.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.462
68 over 36.
Heart rate, 123.

18:54.884 --> 19:00.347
Yeah, well, well, she has
labored breath, but not too
bad for a preemie.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.433
Well, how can you tell
she's a preemie?

19:03.935 --> 19:07.687
From this scar right here
by her belly button from the
umbilical catheter.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.274
Oh, this little girl's
a survivor.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.319
Yeah, she spent her
first few weeks
fighting for life.

19:14.487 --> 19:19.032
She's made it through the
worst of it, but still, she is
gonna need some extra care.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.410
Can you tell if she's
getting that care at home?

19:24.121 --> 19:29.376
Well, I'm not seeing
any signs of physical abuse
or malnourishment,

19:29.460 --> 19:31.419
but beyond that...

19:36.259 --> 19:37.759
Your theory
is wrong.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.512
Computer servers nowadays,
they're all backed up
on a cloud.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.180
There's no real point
in torching it.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.683
Are you trying to tell me
that this server wasn't
tampered with?

19:44.767 --> 19:46.059
Because if you look...
No, No, No. I...

19:46.143 --> 19:47.853
No, I'm not saying
that it wasn't messed with.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.688
I'm just saying
that that wasn't the target.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.106
It was just, the...
It was just a fuse.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.774
Right here.
Look, look at this.

19:53.901 --> 19:57.070
This ceiling debris,
the deepest char is
on the top,

19:57.154 --> 19:59.072
not on the bottom
where the fire started.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.784
So, whoever engineered this,
they packed the above floor
with accelerant.

20:02.952 --> 20:06.830
So, my guess is that someone
really wanted to burn these
billing folders.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.458
So they paid off or leaned
on the IT guys to get
access to the server room

20:10.626 --> 20:12.794
and the utility space
in between the floors.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.590
That's what I think.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.594
This is why we need
you in Arson.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.222
Is that what this was about?

20:24.807 --> 20:29.185
Six firefighters nearly died
in this collapse.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.314
A matter of inches
and they would've been gone,
just like Shay.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.359
Don't...

20:37.612 --> 20:39.195
Don't use her name like that.

20:44.118 --> 20:47.329
All I'm saying
is that a person like you,

20:47.580 --> 20:50.790
with your talent,
and your dedication,

20:51.959 --> 20:54.377
you can help change the way
OFI operates.

20:55.588 --> 21:00.508
You can make sure important
cases like this never fall
through the cracks again.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.768
At least consider it.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.731
Main, this is 61.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.191
We need backup!

21:22.657 --> 21:24.950
Hey, the lady, she said
to call for help.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.202
All right. The lady?
Where is she?

21:27.328 --> 21:29.037
She's downstairs
by the assembly floor.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.456
Okay. Stay inside.
No matter what, all right?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.708
Where are you going?
Just stay inside!

21:41.342 --> 21:44.219
I saw the doctor heading out.
What's the prognosis?

21:45.221 --> 21:46.638
"Healthy for a preemie."

21:47.223 --> 21:50.225
Doc said she spent
the first month in the ICU,
poor thing.

21:51.394 --> 21:54.354
Eight weeks
in this world, she's already
been to hell and back.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.983
My mom spent 38 hours
in labor with me.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.110
I almost didn't make it.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.279
Or she was ready to jump
out a window
to get it over with.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.783
The story tended to vary
when she told it.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.416
She's gonna be fine.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.716
Attention,
we have a level one hazmat,
corner of 37th and Vernon.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.843
Waste container dropped
from a semi.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.803
No victims reported.

22:27.888 --> 22:31.099
It's a level one hazmat.
If you stay, no one will
think less of it.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.269
Okay, I will then. Thanks.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.380
Oh, God! Sorry, you scared me.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.967
I'm sorry. I brought these
papers like you asked.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.386
Right! Right.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.055
Um...

23:10.139 --> 23:12.307
Well, you can take a seat.
DCFS will be here soon.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.649
She's an angel, isn't she?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.486
That's why
I called her Grace.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.822
All the doctors at the
hospital, they said
that she was a miracle.

23:28.324 --> 23:31.367
The healthiest, most beautiful
baby they'd ever seen.

23:32.328 --> 23:35.538
Healthiest?
The doctors said that?

23:36.749 --> 23:37.999
Easiest birth.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.001
She never cried once.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.254
So, then, um, she didn't
spend long in the NICU?

23:45.007 --> 23:46.591
Neonatal intensive care.

23:47.176 --> 23:51.513
No, uh... Not long.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.476
Can I see those documents
you brought?

23:59.438 --> 24:00.688
Um...

24:01.357 --> 24:05.276
Uh, this is, uh,
her sonogram
and some papers.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.861
Medical papers I had.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.074
You don't have
the birth certificate?

24:11.200 --> 24:13.660
No. Miles, he, uh,
he took all that.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.006
Can you hold on a sec?
I need to talk to the chief.

24:31.345 --> 24:34.389
Why don't you, uh,
you let me hold her
while you do that?

24:37.726 --> 24:39.561
You need to move. Now.

24:43.440 --> 24:48.111
No. Not until you give
me that baby.

24:52.408 --> 24:53.992
You need
to get out of here.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.952
You need to turn round
and walk out of here...

24:56.036 --> 24:57.954
Shut up and give her to me.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.915
That's not gonna happen.
Hand her over right now

25:01.000 --> 25:03.042
or I will put you
the hell down, I swear.

25:03.127 --> 25:06.171
Okay, please, Toni, or, or,
or whatever your name is,
you're not even

25:06.255 --> 25:08.256
gonna get two miles
before the amber alert
goes off.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.675
I mean it, bitch!
Right now!

25:10.759 --> 25:13.386
Hey, you stay right there.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.434
Toni, that is the sound
of firefighters about
to fill this room.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.269
You're out of time.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.441
Why don't you leave
right now while you can?

25:28.235 --> 25:29.736
I don't care what you say,
what anybody says.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.196
You can live, you can die.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.031
Either way,
she's coming with me.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.532
No, she's not.

25:34.617 --> 25:36.701
Careful, everyone,
she's got a gun!

25:38.746 --> 25:41.080
Otis, phone CPD right now!

25:54.428 --> 25:57.931
Matt! No! I don't want
anyone in this house chasing
a lunatic with a gun.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.810
Hey. You okay?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.896
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
I'm just...

26:05.189 --> 26:06.439
Oh, God!

26:15.407 --> 26:16.574
Celia?

26:24.166 --> 26:26.167
Celia! Is that you?

26:28.212 --> 26:30.338
Celia, listen to me.

26:31.715 --> 26:36.678
I want you to stop moving
and stay perfectly still.
Can you do that?

26:39.014 --> 26:42.016
Atta girl.
I'll be right there.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.143
Perfectly still...

26:46.188 --> 26:48.940
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you home.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.818
No! Not, not home.
Not like this.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.528
No, no, no! Celia, wait!

26:53.612 --> 26:55.989
I'm serious.
You, you need to stop moving.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.534
Please.
I'm not here
to get you in trouble.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.579
Perfectly still.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.707
Okay, thank you.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.501
Perfectly still.
Okay. Slow.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.089
Easy. Easy.

27:14.216 --> 27:15.216
Go slow.

27:19.513 --> 27:20.555
Help!

27:23.392 --> 27:26.811
Hey! Just got off
the phone with the police.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.230
They've put out
an investigative alert
on the woman.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.442
What are we supposed to
do if she comes back here?

27:32.735 --> 27:34.319
We gotta get this baby
out of here.

27:34.403 --> 27:37.196
We have an ambo en route
for the infant
now that we've upgraded

27:37.281 --> 27:39.073
the situation to an emergency.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.034
Have you heard
from Brett and Mills?

27:42.995 --> 27:45.872
If there are any more
updates, you'll be informed.

27:49.418 --> 27:50.418
Okay.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.594
Ambo 61, report.

28:03.432 --> 28:06.184
Ambo 61,
this is Station 51, report.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.563
Brett, where are you?
Call out!

28:10.647 --> 28:13.358
We're here!
Help!

28:14.610 --> 28:17.445
Help!
Somebody help!

28:17.529 --> 28:19.614
Brett! I'm coming.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.032
Mills! Quick!

28:21.116 --> 28:22.617
We're in here!

28:24.286 --> 28:25.703
I can't hold on
much longer!

28:25.788 --> 28:27.372
Yeah. I got her. I got her.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.456
What do we do?

28:31.627 --> 28:32.752
Check in your jump bag.

28:32.836 --> 28:37.423
Gotta be anything, uh, wraps,
straps, tubing, anything we
can use as a makeshift rope.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.675
Come on, stick with me.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.178
I got you, okay?
All right.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.223
Ambo 61. Brett. Report!

28:50.479 --> 28:55.233
Listen, just give me
a sign that you're okay.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.151
Anything at all.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.281
Hello?

29:03.659 --> 29:05.410
Who... Who is this?

29:05.494 --> 29:06.744
This is Abe.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.162
Who's this?

29:11.834 --> 29:13.835
Hey, I'd like to go
to the hospital with her.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.129
Make sure she stays in
good hands.
Of course.

29:16.922 --> 29:17.964
Thanks, Matt.

29:22.428 --> 29:26.722
I know today's been kind
of, um, confusing, maybe?

29:28.225 --> 29:29.934
I hope I didn't come
across as...

29:31.478 --> 29:32.645
Not at all.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.025
Oh, there's my ride.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.529
You're gonna make
a great mom.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.417
Hey!

29:56.211 --> 29:58.004
Uh, what's going on
with you and Dawson?

29:58.797 --> 30:01.215
Uh, just old habits, I guess.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.886
Maybe it's time to put
yourself back
on the market.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.930
Cut the ambiguity.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.976
You know what?

30:12.478 --> 30:13.936
I think you're right.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.731
'Cause I'm kind of chasing
my tail right now.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.400
Lieutenant!
Brett and Mills are
in trouble.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.168
Mouch, Herrmann,
stay with the ambo.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.753
Everyone else with me.

30:41.632 --> 30:42.632
Sylvie!

30:42.883 --> 30:45.134
We're here! Quick!
Over here!

30:45.260 --> 30:46.260
Sylvie!

30:46.345 --> 30:47.678
Cruz! Careful!

30:48.639 --> 30:50.389
I'm okay!
Help us hold her!

30:50.474 --> 30:52.517
Everybody,
watch your step!

30:53.644 --> 30:55.436
We rigged this to keep her
from falling any deeper,

30:55.521 --> 30:56.854
but it's not gonna hold
too long.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.481
The barb's sticking
into her torso.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.607
She's losing blood.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.945
We'll take it from here.
Otis! Tie a girth wrap.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.030
Okay, what do you think?
Mini-lite cutters?

31:06.114 --> 31:07.949
Cutters could cause too much
of a jolt.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.742
That rebar's in there
is pretty good.
I need to go slow.

31:09.826 --> 31:10.868
Okay.

31:10.953 --> 31:11.953
Capp!
Yeah?

31:12.037 --> 31:13.287
Sawzall saw.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.208
Okay.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.962
Good.
Secure!

31:21.463 --> 31:22.547
Tony!

31:25.592 --> 31:29.095
No! No! No, no!
No, no! No, no!

31:29.179 --> 31:30.304
Hey, hey! Calm down!

31:30.389 --> 31:32.390
No, no! This isn't real,
this isn't real...
Hey, sweetie, listen!

31:32.474 --> 31:34.350
I'm not gonna be able to cut
through this rebar

31:34.434 --> 31:35.560
unless you calm down, okay?

31:35.644 --> 31:37.436
I need her to calm down.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.442
Celia! Look at me.
This isn't real.
This isn't real.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.736
Look at my face.
Right in my eyes.

31:46.697 --> 31:48.322
All right, do you feel
my hand?

31:48.824 --> 31:52.285
You feel the texture of my
skin? Okay, that's
definitely real. Right?

31:52.536 --> 31:53.995
Do you believe me?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.621
Can you trust me that much?

31:56.873 --> 32:00.001
Then trust me when I say
we're here to help you, okay?

32:00.085 --> 32:02.503
But we need you
to stay still, okay?

32:02.754 --> 32:03.754
Okay.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.349
All right, I'm done!

32:15.684 --> 32:16.934
All right!
Let's get her up!

32:17.019 --> 32:19.020
One, two, three.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.106
I got you.

32:23.317 --> 32:24.358
Got her?
Yep!

32:26.945 --> 32:28.154
Watch the harness.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.200
That was incredible.

32:34.119 --> 32:37.747
I think I'm finally with you
on the cold.

32:39.666 --> 32:40.791
It's okay.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.836
Hey, Brett, let's get her
to Chicago Med.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.421
I'll see you back at
the house.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.547
Yeah.

32:53.055 --> 32:54.597
Hey. I heard what happened.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.390
Did they ever find
that woman?

32:57.225 --> 33:00.019
Uh, cops caught her
about a mile away from 51

33:00.103 --> 33:01.896
trying to escape on foot.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.858
She's in ICU now,
battling hypothermia.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.903
I guess she has some
psych history.
Admitted a couple times.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.363
I don't know. I don't care.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.947
And the real mom?

33:12.032 --> 33:13.407
En route from Indiana.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.745
Baby was taken straight
from their house, apparently.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.330
Ugh.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.291
Uh, how about the girl
you saved?

33:22.709 --> 33:25.211
Stable.
Trying to locate her mom.

33:25.295 --> 33:27.338
I guess the dad's not
really in the picture.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.345
What a job, huh?

33:36.098 --> 33:37.139
Yeah.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.020
Whoa!
Oh, Yeah!

33:44.564 --> 33:45.815
What the hell.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.733
Welcome, son,
to the Wallace Boden

33:47.818 --> 33:50.861
not-so-annual-anymore
winter luau.

33:50.946 --> 33:55.241
Always, I mean, always a big
hit whenever I throw one.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.702
Come on, live a little.
Okay.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.037
Hey there, Detective!

34:00.163 --> 34:02.206
Hey! Hey!
Is this
what you're looking for?

34:02.290 --> 34:04.041
Ah, looks like you
nailed it, kid.

34:04.126 --> 34:05.376
All right.

34:05.752 --> 34:06.711
Aloha.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.924
Sure. I'll take
your word for it.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.801
Thank you.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.345
Luau!

34:20.475 --> 34:21.642
Hey, give me your number,
I'll...

34:21.768 --> 34:23.102
Gone.

34:26.314 --> 34:27.481
Fun party, huh?

34:28.316 --> 34:29.692
I needed this.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.694
Hey. We're doing
kamikaze shots, you in?

34:32.320 --> 34:34.613
I so needed this.

34:35.490 --> 34:38.409
Okay, uh,
I'll check on you later.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.329
Excuse me.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.754
You're stalking me now.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.547
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.843
It's too late.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.388
You thought about my offer?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.725
Yeah, I have. Uh, and...

35:03.685 --> 35:05.144
I'm good where I'm at.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.273
Well, when you change
your mind,

35:10.025 --> 35:12.276
and you will, call me.

35:13.695 --> 35:14.862
Fair enough.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.910
You know, I don't think
I ever got to say it during
all this craziness,

35:20.994 --> 35:23.370
I'm sorry about Shay.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.875
I really am.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.254
Yeah, you know...

35:35.634 --> 35:37.218
She would've loved this.

35:38.804 --> 35:43.098
There's a Hawaiian expression,
for the men in the canoe
who were paddling.

35:43.934 --> 35:46.727
It's been awhile,
I might butcher this,
but here goes.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.778
"United we move forward."

35:56.822 --> 36:01.617
It's a toast I used
to give my fellow cops
every year at the luau,

36:02.744 --> 36:04.328
but it applies to you as well.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.915
For all you go through.
The things you have to handle.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.376
The people you've lost.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.296
You can't go it alone.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.510
United we move forward.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.513
- Amen to that.
- Amen!

36:29.020 --> 36:30.896
Thank you, Pop.
Hmm.

36:57.299 --> 36:58.382
Hey!

37:00.176 --> 37:03.804
Uh, two kamikazes
down at the end?

37:04.639 --> 37:05.723
Yep.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.479
Janitor
to the oncology waiting room
in the West.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.564
They're here.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.358
Janitor
to the oncology waiting room
in the West.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.611
They're here.
Oh.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.654
I know they would love
to meet you.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.239
I can tell them
that you're here.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.826
Oh, uh... No. No, no, no.
That's fine.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.851
Honestly, Wallace.
Thank you. Thank you.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.562
It was everything I wanted
and more.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.607
You're welcome, Pop.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.901
And we're gonna
do it again next year.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.247
Hmm. Let's not wake Donna.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.582
No, no, Pop. No, I got it.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.876
You're sure?
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely,
I'm sure.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.128
Go on, sit back.

38:59.546 --> 39:01.547
- All right.
- Yeah.

39:08.972 --> 39:12.766
Freezing!
So who did you know
at the luau?

39:13.101 --> 39:16.145
Uh, no one, really.

39:16.938 --> 39:19.940
I mean, I know a few
firefighters, that's how
I heard about the event.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.944
My girlfriend was supposed
to meet me there and her car
froze to death, so...

39:24.029 --> 39:25.029
Hmm.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.616
And then you came along.

39:33.455 --> 39:35.414
I'm just getting out
of a relationship.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.791
Me too.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.216
So can I get you a drink?

39:47.802 --> 39:48.802
Later.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.510
He went down, Pop.

40:30.053 --> 40:31.053
Pop?

40:35.642 --> 40:36.642
Pop?

40:44.734 --> 40:45.734
Dad?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.824
Um, wait,
so what's Cinco de Mayo for?

41:33.908 --> 41:35.367
Is it like their
Fourth of July or something?

41:35.451 --> 41:36.743
Yeah,
I'm not sure.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.245
What, is it or isn't it?

41:38.580 --> 41:41.999
I don't know,
it's not like a Mexican
Independence day.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.459
It's just like a day
for celebration. That's all.

41:44.544 --> 41:45.836
Hmm, all right.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.754
Well, I am all for it.

41:48.256 --> 41:50.591
Right. Here we go.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.677
What's in it?

41:54.429 --> 41:55.762
Secret recipe.

41:57.390 --> 41:58.390
Cheers.
