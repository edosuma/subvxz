00:00.492 --> 00:02.025
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:02.025 --> 00:03.326
Oh my God!

00:03.327 --> 00:04.495
<i>Uh...</i>

00:04.496 --> 00:05.496
Hey.

00:05.497 --> 00:06.997
<i>(Laughs)</i>

00:06.998 --> 00:09.532
How dare you bring
that stable hand here

00:09.533 --> 00:12.002
and talk about your
trailer trash pursuits at my club!

00:12.003 --> 00:13.903
I'll stop talking about it...

00:13.904 --> 00:15.372
As long as I get to keep
Apollo.

00:15.373 --> 00:17.840
I will not be blackmailed.

00:17.841 --> 00:21.077
That is quite the situation
you got yourself into.

00:21.078 --> 00:23.480
Were you living
in that place?

00:23.481 --> 00:25.281
With your dad?

00:25.282 --> 00:26.249
Yeah.

00:28.785 --> 00:30.487
I can see
that worked out well.

00:37.294 --> 00:38.928
(Exhales forcefully)

00:41.832 --> 00:43.933
It's like a million degrees
in here.

00:43.934 --> 00:45.001
Did you open up
all the windows?

00:45.002 --> 00:46.936
Every single one.

00:48.138 --> 00:49.405
(Sighs)

00:49.406 --> 00:50.940
It's too hot to sleep.

00:50.941 --> 00:53.910
It's too hot to move.
It's too hot to breathe.

00:53.911 --> 00:55.711
Lemonade?

00:55.712 --> 00:57.479
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what I need -

00:57.480 --> 00:59.916
a sugar rush
at two in the morning.

00:59.917 --> 01:00.917
Well, apparently,

01:00.918 --> 01:03.586
it's not too hot
to be sarcastic.

01:03.587 --> 01:04.486
(Fan clunks)

01:05.556 --> 01:07.924
(Chuckles softly)

01:07.925 --> 01:10.192
(Wolf howls in the distance)

01:13.896 --> 01:15.931
(Slow, heavy of footfalls)

01:17.533 --> 01:18.600
(Ty roars,
Mallory screams)

01:18.601 --> 01:19.801
Ty:
(Laughs) Ow!

01:21.671 --> 01:23.071
You're such a boy!

01:23.072 --> 01:24.639
That's a pretty nice
right hook.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.374
Who knew you were
such a scrapper?

01:26.375 --> 01:28.843
I've seen "Million Dollar Baby"
twice.

01:28.844 --> 01:31.279
What're you doing out here anyway?
It's the middle of the night.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.515
I refuse to go back into the house
until Jack gets an air conditioner.

01:34.516 --> 01:35.650
Do you hear that?

01:35.651 --> 01:38.486
(Low rumble
of approaching truck)

01:42.892 --> 01:45.525
(Truck rumbles up driveway)

01:49.197 --> 01:50.564
You guys expecting company?

01:52.667 --> 01:55.469
(Truck tires crunch
over gravel)

02:01.977 --> 02:03.410
(Truck door opens)

02:07.448 --> 02:08.983
(Door clunks shut)

02:08.984 --> 02:10.851
Dad?

02:10.852 --> 02:12.586
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>are you doing here?</i>

02:12.587 --> 02:14.154
I need your help,
Ty.

02:14.155 --> 02:15.088
I think you took
a wrong turn.

02:15.089 --> 02:16.555
The highway's back
the way you came.

02:16.556 --> 02:17.757
I didn't know
where else to go.

02:17.758 --> 02:20.827
You can go to hell
for all I care.

02:20.828 --> 02:21.861
I got animals in the back.

02:21.862 --> 02:23.295
They're not doing very well
in this heat.

02:23.296 --> 02:25.264
What kind of animals?

02:26.266 --> 02:27.466
Horses.

02:27.467 --> 02:29.636
No, you can't have horses
in a cattle truck!

02:29.637 --> 02:32.672
My boss didn't give me
any choice.

02:32.673 --> 02:35.942
I didn't realize they were sick
until I got to a gas station.

02:35.943 --> 02:38.444
I knew you were working here,
so I thought maybe...

02:42.582 --> 02:43.683
Amy:
(Coughs)

02:44.351 --> 02:47.519
Ty, Amy and Mallory:
(Coughing)

02:47.520 --> 02:48.453
Amy:
Give me the flashlight.

02:48.454 --> 02:49.320
Ty:
Here.

02:49.321 --> 02:50.889
Lou:
Mallory, go inside.

02:50.890 --> 02:52.124
Wake up grampa.

02:55.928 --> 02:57.328
(Horse nickering)

03:03.169 --> 03:04.269
(Horse nickers)

03:05.304 --> 03:06.271
Oh my God.

03:10.977 --> 03:12.077
(Horse grunts)

03:16.782 --> 03:17.948
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Here.</i>

03:19.151 --> 03:20.350
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Go back inside, Mallory.</i>

03:20.351 --> 03:22.251
- But Jack...
- Go back inside.

03:24.756 --> 03:26.290
How many more
are in there?

03:26.291 --> 03:28.159
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>There's just one.</i>

03:28.160 --> 03:30.360
But she's lying down.

03:30.361 --> 03:31.562
<i>Lou, take those horses</i>
<i>to the paddock</i>

03:31.563 --> 03:33.197
<i>and make sure</i>
<i>they get some water.</i>

03:33.198 --> 03:34.131
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>I called Scott.</i>

03:34.132 --> 03:35.199
He's driving back
from Red Deer,

03:35.200 --> 03:36.767
but he probably won't be here
till morning.

03:42.207 --> 03:44.909
(Calming horse)
Shhhh...

03:44.910 --> 03:45.876
Shhhh...

04:00.257 --> 04:02.658
She hit her head pretty bad.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.394
These pot trucks are too low
for horses.

04:05.395 --> 04:06.596
They lose their balance.

04:06.597 --> 04:08.765
<i>Then they get trampled.</i>

04:08.766 --> 04:10.934
I'm so sorry, girl.

04:10.935 --> 04:12.202
Ty:
Amy...

04:12.203 --> 04:13.369
We should concentrate
on the other horses.

04:13.370 --> 04:15.138
Come on.

04:15.139 --> 04:16.940
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>He's right.</i>

04:16.940 --> 04:19.108
I know it's the last thing
you wanna hear,

04:19.108 --> 04:21.343
but we gotta move on.

04:22.511 --> 04:24.146
Ty: Come on, Amy. Come on.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.148
(Horse snuffles)

04:36.926 --> 04:38.160
Amy:
Grandpa!

04:38.161 --> 04:39.461
Grandpa, no!

04:39.462 --> 04:41.529
Amy, there's nothing anyone
can do for that horse

04:41.530 --> 04:43.098
and you know it.

04:43.099 --> 04:45.134
Grandpa, Scott's gonna
be here in the morning.

04:45.135 --> 04:46.534
She's in a lot of pain now

04:46.535 --> 04:48.535
and she won't make it
till morning.

04:49.538 --> 04:52.106
Do you really want her
to suffer until then?

04:52.107 --> 04:53.074
Grandpa, please.

04:57.112 --> 04:58.112
Please.

06:14.988 --> 06:18.390
So, it turns out Ty's dad
was telling the truth.

06:18.391 --> 06:19.491
He picked up the horses

06:19.492 --> 06:22.394
at a livestock auction house
near Spencerville.

06:22.395 --> 06:24.362
Scott:
Where was he taking them?

06:24.363 --> 06:25.629
Um...

06:25.630 --> 06:27.298
It just says DRC Exports.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.566
<i>Have you ever heard of it?</i>

06:28.567 --> 06:31.502
Scott: Yeah.
It's a slaughterhouse up north.

06:31.503 --> 06:32.971
It was a meat truck?

06:32.972 --> 06:34.305
I overheard Brad
on the phone with his boss.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.306
He's supposed
to make the delivery

06:35.307 --> 06:36.741
as soon as the horses recover.

06:36.742 --> 06:37.775
He can't do that, Lou.

06:37.776 --> 06:39.043
These horses were put
on a cattle truck.

06:39.044 --> 06:40.345
That's gotta be illegal.

06:40.346 --> 06:41.212
I don't think it is,
Amy.

06:42.948 --> 06:43.915
We have to do something.

06:45.017 --> 06:47.218
I'll file a report
with the RCMP,

06:47.219 --> 06:49.220
<i>but I wouldn't get my hopes up</i>
<i>if I were you.</i>

06:49.221 --> 06:50.654
I'm gonna call
Rodriguez.

06:50.655 --> 06:51.856
Caleb: Sounds like a
whole lot of trouble

06:51.857 --> 06:53.957
for a bunch of horses
on a one way trip.

06:53.958 --> 06:55.859
How can you say that?

06:55.860 --> 06:57.827
Sorry.
I don't mean to sound cold,

06:57.828 --> 07:00.463
but this type of thing
happens all the time.

07:00.464 --> 07:01.999
Doesn't make it right.

07:07.405 --> 07:09.373
(Unintelligible conversation)

07:11.776 --> 07:13.743
Want me to kick him off?

07:15.179 --> 07:16.179
No.

07:17.248 --> 07:18.782
You sure?

07:18.783 --> 07:20.083
Yeah.

07:20.785 --> 07:22.920
'Cause I got some experience
in that department.

07:26.056 --> 07:28.257
I think, this is something
I have to do on my own.

07:28.258 --> 07:30.692
Jack:
I get that.

07:30.693 --> 07:33.529
Just, uh, remember one thing
for me.

07:35.665 --> 07:37.967
Just 'cause you hope
someone's gonna change

07:37.968 --> 07:39.268
doesn't mean he will.

07:40.270 --> 07:41.270
I know.

07:42.639 --> 07:44.640
(Unintelligible chatter)

07:46.810 --> 07:49.511
Ashley:
You have got to be kidding me.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.380
An economy car?!

07:51.381 --> 07:52.848
You're lucky you have a car
at all.

07:52.849 --> 07:56.251
You expect me to be seen
in public driving that?

07:56.252 --> 07:58.053
My expectations of you,
my dear,

07:58.054 --> 08:00.355
these days
are pretty low.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.327
When'd you start golfing
anyway?

08:05.328 --> 08:06.894
Since the lounge
at the country club

08:06.895 --> 08:09.664
started selling fishbowl
margaritas.

08:09.665 --> 08:12.934
Plus the bartender
looks like Johnny Depp.

08:12.935 --> 08:14.469
Is that supposed to be funny,
Ashley?

08:14.470 --> 08:15.536
I'm not even smiling.

08:15.537 --> 08:16.637
Oh, mother,

08:16.638 --> 08:18.239
you haven't smiled
since the Botox.

08:20.376 --> 08:22.110
I want you back here
by four.

08:22.111 --> 08:24.545
I've got a group of Japanese
investors touring the stables,

08:24.546 --> 08:25.546
and I want them
to meet you.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.647
Oh... not again.

08:26.648 --> 08:28.983
It's too hot to pretend
to be a happy family.

08:28.984 --> 08:30.250
Ashley,

08:30.251 --> 08:31.952
I just took away your BMW,

08:31.953 --> 08:34.421
do you want me to take away
your allowance too?

08:34.422 --> 08:35.389
(Horn beeps)

08:37.258 --> 08:38.558
(Ignition turns)

08:41.863 --> 08:42.828
Easy... easy...

08:47.768 --> 08:49.569
What did the vet say?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.238
These guys
are gonna be fine.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.607
The two in the barn
are pretty sick though.

08:53.608 --> 08:56.076
I didn't mean to cause
all this trouble.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.611
Yeah, you never do.

08:58.678 --> 09:01.014
I've been driving cattle trucks
for a few months.

09:01.015 --> 09:03.349
Never had to load horses
before.

09:03.350 --> 09:04.417
It's too bad,

09:04.418 --> 09:05.951
'cause it was a pretty good job
up 'til now.

09:05.952 --> 09:07.286
Yeah, a job where
you're always leaving -

09:07.287 --> 09:09.389
you must be pretty good
at it.

09:09.390 --> 09:11.790
I know you're angry, Ty.

09:12.826 --> 09:15.995
Things just got really bad in Calgary.
I had to get outta there.

09:15.996 --> 09:17.530
Yeah. No kidding.

09:17.531 --> 09:20.099
Those guys you owed money to?
They found me.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.401
What do you mean
they found you?

09:21.402 --> 09:22.801
I mean, they were looking
for a face to smash in

09:22.802 --> 09:25.338
and they didn't much care
if it was yours or mine.

09:26.540 --> 09:28.007
Ty, I'm sorry.

09:29.042 --> 09:32.244
I didn't know.
I mean... I swear.

09:33.312 --> 09:34.479
<i>I never would've left</i>

09:34.480 --> 09:35.980
<i>if I thought</i>
<i>you were in danger.</i>

09:35.981 --> 09:38.583
You're so full of crap!
You know that?!

09:38.584 --> 09:39.751
You left
and I got beat up.

09:39.752 --> 09:41.486
How is that any different
than when I was a kid?

09:41.487 --> 09:42.820
Okay,
that's not fair!

09:42.821 --> 09:46.091
That was a long time ago.

09:46.092 --> 09:47.125
And I thought you
and your mom

09:47.126 --> 09:48.893
would be better off
without me.

09:48.894 --> 09:51.063
Well, you were wrong.

09:52.131 --> 09:54.332
You know, I hope it keeps you
up at night thinking about her

09:54.333 --> 09:56.768
and that guy she married -

09:56.769 --> 10:00.304
what he did to her...
And to me.

10:00.305 --> 10:03.407
I can't change
what happened.

10:03.408 --> 10:05.509
But things
are different now.

10:05.510 --> 10:07.111
Hey, I could've taken
those horses

10:07.112 --> 10:08.879
to the slaughterhouse,
got my fee,

10:08.880 --> 10:11.582
nobody would've known
any different.

10:11.583 --> 10:12.649
I did the right thing.

10:12.650 --> 10:13.650
So, what do you want,
a medal?

10:13.651 --> 10:16.687
No.

10:16.688 --> 10:19.256
No, I want you to know...

10:21.593 --> 10:22.693
I need you to know

10:22.694 --> 10:24.095
that I wanna do
the right thing here.

10:24.096 --> 10:27.364
I'm not just talking
about the horses.

10:28.366 --> 10:29.933
I'm not buying it, dad.

10:29.934 --> 10:30.934
Not this time.

10:37.475 --> 10:39.442
<i>(Screen door bangs shut)</i>

10:42.713 --> 10:44.581
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Are looking for something?</i>

10:44.582 --> 10:46.015
(Sighs)

10:46.016 --> 10:48.084
I wouldn't have to resort
to such drastic measures if-

10:48.085 --> 10:48.951
Jack:
Ah!

10:50.521 --> 10:52.822
If you'd just get
an air conditioner.

10:52.823 --> 10:54.324
I've lived here
all my life,

10:54.325 --> 10:55.925
I've never needed one.

10:55.926 --> 10:56.993
If you're hot-

10:56.994 --> 10:58.161
I know.
Go outside.

10:58.162 --> 10:59.529
That's right.

10:59.530 --> 11:00.830
Outside where I'll
get sunstroke

11:00.831 --> 11:02.797
and eaten alive
by mosquitoes.

11:02.798 --> 11:04.833
Well, you could always go
swimming in the pond;

11:04.834 --> 11:06.435
That'd cool you right off.

11:06.436 --> 11:07.503
Really, Jack?

11:07.504 --> 11:09.371
Sure. So long as you
don't mind the leeches;

11:09.372 --> 11:11.173
They're pretty bad
this time of year.

11:12.041 --> 11:15.277
<i>If I ever catch you holding</i>
<i>that fridge door open again,</i>

11:15.278 --> 11:17.546
I will throw you
in that pond myself.

11:19.915 --> 11:21.916
<i>(Screen door shuts)</i>

11:24.154 --> 11:25.254
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>You know, it's weird.</i>

11:25.255 --> 11:26.855
This is a warm-blood.

11:26.856 --> 11:28.257
So?

11:28.258 --> 11:29.991
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>I don't know, I...</i>

11:29.992 --> 11:31.260
Think I've treated
this horse before

11:31.261 --> 11:32.528
or something.

11:32.529 --> 11:33.894
That's impossible.

11:33.895 --> 11:35.329
Why's that?

11:35.330 --> 11:37.231
'Cause there's no way
a horse you treated

11:37.232 --> 11:39.233
would end up
on a meat truck.

11:40.302 --> 11:42.236
I hope you're right.

11:43.472 --> 11:44.905
(Bucket of water sloshes)

11:44.906 --> 11:45.873
(Horse nickers)

11:52.981 --> 11:53.981
Apollo?

11:54.816 --> 11:55.749
What was that?

11:57.352 --> 11:59.687
This is Ashley's horse.

12:08.667 --> 12:09.900
(Water sloshes)

12:14.673 --> 12:18.508
(Relieved sigh)
That's what I'm talking about.

12:18.509 --> 12:20.844
Sorry the lemonade
isn't very cold.

12:20.845 --> 12:22.412
I, um, could've sworn

12:22.413 --> 12:24.381
I bought three bags of ice
yesterday.

12:24.382 --> 12:25.448
Well, that might explain

12:25.449 --> 12:27.984
why I just saw a short, blonde girl
stealing ice from the freezer.

12:27.985 --> 12:28.719
(Half laughs)

12:29.020 --> 12:30.419
Mallory.

12:30.788 --> 12:32.021
I should've known.

12:32.022 --> 12:33.589
I could arrest her
if you wanted.

12:33.590 --> 12:35.024
No. No, I'm serious.

12:35.025 --> 12:36.258
These things
are a slippery slope.

12:36.259 --> 12:37.326
I should know.

12:37.327 --> 12:38.294
Couple nights
in the county jail

12:38.295 --> 12:39.361
might set her straight.

12:39.362 --> 12:40.730
No, don't do that.

12:40.731 --> 12:42.765
I would feel sorry
for the other inmates.

12:42.766 --> 12:44.067
A few nights with Mallory

12:44.068 --> 12:45.534
and they'd be begging
for solitary confinement.

12:45.535 --> 12:46.402
Both:
(Laugh)

12:53.010 --> 12:54.643
That's good.

12:54.644 --> 12:57.313
Good. Yeah.
(Clears throat)

12:59.048 --> 13:02.017
So, what're you doing
Friday night?

13:02.018 --> 13:02.884
Friday-
Friday night?

13:02.885 --> 13:04.052
Yeah.

13:04.053 --> 13:05.587
Assuming there are no
horse emergencies, thefts,

13:05.588 --> 13:07.388
or, uh, dude ranch guests
gone wild.

13:07.389 --> 13:08.256
Both:
(Laugh)

13:08.257 --> 13:09.224
Um...

13:10.559 --> 13:11.860
Scott! Hi.

13:13.462 --> 13:16.297
Uh, do you know Mark?
Constable Rodriguez?

13:16.298 --> 13:17.766
Uh, no,
I don't think we've met.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.334
You must be the vet.

13:19.335 --> 13:21.136
Yeah. That's me.

13:21.137 --> 13:22.104
The vet.

13:24.974 --> 13:26.274
<i>Rodriguez:</i> <i>Well, a lot of
people</i> <i>are calling for a ban</i>

13:26.275 --> 13:27.642
<i>on transporting horses</i>
<i>in pot trucks,</i>

13:27.643 --> 13:28.977
but it's not illegal.

13:28.978 --> 13:30.211
At least not in Alberta.

13:30.212 --> 13:32.312
They were so dehydrated.

13:32.313 --> 13:33.313
Those horses were sick

13:33.314 --> 13:35.816
long before
they got on that truck.

13:35.817 --> 13:38.085
Well, that's gonna be hard
to prove.

13:38.086 --> 13:40.154
Well, did you go check out
the auction house?

13:40.155 --> 13:41.856
Yeah. Yeah, I stopped by
on the way over.

13:41.857 --> 13:43.590
It's uh...
It's not a pretty place,

13:43.591 --> 13:46.093
but I didn't see anything
out of the ordinary.

13:46.094 --> 13:49.730
So you're saying there's nothing
we can do to save those horses?

13:49.731 --> 13:51.098
Not unless you own them.

13:51.099 --> 13:53.200
You mean, buy them
from the auction house?

13:53.201 --> 13:56.169
Yeah, usually these places only sell
to slaughterhouses as a last resort.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.537
So, uh...

13:57.538 --> 14:01.307
If you talked to them,
you might be able to work out a deal.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.876
Well, uh...
I should get going.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.781
If you have any questions,
you've got my number.

14:07.782 --> 14:08.848
I'm sure she does.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.952
Lou: <i>Thanks for stopping by,</i>
<i>Constable.</i>

14:12.953 --> 14:14.053
Yeah.
Thanks for the lemonade.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.660
I'll see myself out.

14:22.797 --> 14:23.797
(Clears her throat)

14:24.899 --> 14:25.999
Ashley:
(Crying)

14:26.000 --> 14:28.768
Why would my mother
do this?

14:28.769 --> 14:30.503
<i>(Sniffles)</i>

14:30.504 --> 14:31.970
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

14:33.006 --> 14:34.940
If I hadn't stopped jumping...

14:34.941 --> 14:36.541
(Teary breaths)

14:37.643 --> 14:39.577
I'm so sorry, boy.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.848
I'm so sorry.
(Cries)

14:43.917 --> 14:44.850
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

14:47.020 --> 14:49.955
I mean, I guess we could use
a few of 'em for trail rides.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.224
We'd have to re-home
the rest of them.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.625
I don't know.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.626
It's a big decision.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.930
Whatever you decide to do,
after we're done with these horses,

14:57.931 --> 15:00.833
I think you should
find another vet.

15:00.834 --> 15:01.800
What?!

15:03.535 --> 15:04.601
(Sighs)

15:05.237 --> 15:08.239
We've both gotta move on,
Lou.

15:10.642 --> 15:12.710
(Dumfounded breath)

15:16.048 --> 15:18.115
(Water sprays forcefully)

15:21.053 --> 15:22.854
Rodriguez:
This your truck?

15:22.855 --> 15:23.654
Brad:
Yeah.

15:25.991 --> 15:28.926
Those horses look sick
before you loaded them?

15:28.927 --> 15:30.361
It was pretty dark.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.764
I didn't really get a good look
at 'em till after I left.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.165
When I saw that one horse
lying on the floor there,

15:35.166 --> 15:36.432
I got here
as fast as I could.

15:36.433 --> 15:38.235
Mm-hm.

15:38.236 --> 15:41.204
Well, there's gotta be about a dozen
ranches between here and the highway.

15:41.205 --> 15:42.839
Why Heartland?

15:45.209 --> 15:47.110
I didn't do anything wrong.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.180
Maybe.

15:51.349 --> 15:52.615
Maybe not.

15:53.650 --> 15:56.052
When a guy drives through town
with a record as long as yours,

15:56.053 --> 15:59.222
I'm not about to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

15:59.223 --> 16:02.792
I'd rather he just
kept on driving.

16:02.793 --> 16:04.660
Do I make myself clear?

16:04.661 --> 16:05.627
Yeah.

16:09.933 --> 16:12.234
You missed a spot.

16:13.303 --> 16:14.270
(Horse nickers)

16:15.272 --> 16:16.671
(Banging on door)

16:16.672 --> 16:18.440
Come on, Mallory.
I need to shower.

16:18.441 --> 16:19.909
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>I'll be out in a minute.</i>

16:19.910 --> 16:21.076
Hey, there you are.

16:21.077 --> 16:22.511
I'm heading into town.
You need anything?

16:22.512 --> 16:24.613
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Tell Ty to
pick up</i> <i>some more ice.</i>

16:24.614 --> 16:25.915
Did you get that?

16:25.916 --> 16:27.983
Yes, Mallory!

16:27.984 --> 16:30.519
Hey, I saw Ashley
in the barn.

16:30.520 --> 16:31.954
I can't believe
that's Apollo.

16:31.955 --> 16:32.988
I know.

16:32.989 --> 16:34.189
She's been with him
all morning.

16:34.190 --> 16:36.057
Ty:
Val Stanton is some mom.

16:36.058 --> 16:37.191
Hey, Ty?

16:37.960 --> 16:39.660
Speaking of parents,

16:39.661 --> 16:42.430
how's it going
with your dad?

16:43.132 --> 16:44.198
I don't know.

16:44.199 --> 16:45.866
He's all "let's try again,
I'm a new man."

16:45.867 --> 16:48.202
But I've heard
that one before.

16:48.203 --> 16:52.106
How did he know
you were here anyway?

16:52.107 --> 16:54.642
I wrote him
after I moved back.

16:54.643 --> 16:55.709
I shouldn't have,

16:55.710 --> 16:57.378
but I guess
I just wanted him to care.

16:57.379 --> 16:58.446
It was stupid,
but...

16:58.447 --> 17:00.214
It's not stupid.

17:00.215 --> 17:02.650
Hey, he wouldn't be here
if he didn't care.

17:02.651 --> 17:04.452
Doesn't matter.
As far as I'm concerned,

17:04.453 --> 17:06.619
as soon as we're done
with those horses,

17:06.621 --> 17:09.289
me and my dad?
We're done too.

17:10.325 --> 17:11.290
Amy?

17:13.661 --> 17:14.627
Amy.

17:17.332 --> 17:18.365
Ashley?

17:19.834 --> 17:22.269
What are you doing here?

17:22.270 --> 17:24.404
Amy didn't tell you?

17:24.405 --> 17:26.006
Tell me what?

17:26.007 --> 17:27.473
It's Apollo.

17:28.776 --> 17:30.243
Oh my God...

17:32.981 --> 17:35.449
You'll help him, right?

17:35.450 --> 17:36.916
That's what you do here
at Heartland,

17:36.917 --> 17:38.951
you...you save horses.

17:38.952 --> 17:39.952
I'm gonna call your mom.

17:39.953 --> 17:41.454
No!

17:41.455 --> 17:43.456
You can't do that.

17:44.091 --> 17:47.093
She's the one
that sold Apollo.

17:47.094 --> 17:49.595
(Horse nickers,
Ashley sniffles)

17:49.596 --> 17:52.631
Lou, please...

17:52.632 --> 17:54.433
Don't let him go
to the slaughterhouse.

17:57.471 --> 17:58.704
Please...

18:06.480 --> 18:07.480
What're you doing?

18:07.481 --> 18:09.680
Well, I'm dying to see
this Hudson place.

18:09.681 --> 18:11.582
Well, you can find
your own ride then.

18:11.583 --> 18:12.717
Come on, Ty.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.553
Show me where you hang out:
Your high school...

18:15.554 --> 18:17.088
My high school?
Yeah.

18:17.089 --> 18:18.589
You're kidding right?

18:18.590 --> 18:19.657
Back in Calgary,

18:19.658 --> 18:21.893
you said you wanted to go
back to school.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.728
Yeah, well, things change.
Now get out.

18:23.729 --> 18:27.165
(Sighs) I won't bother you.
All right?

18:27.166 --> 18:30.535
You won't even know I'm here,
I swear.

18:30.536 --> 18:32.137
Whatever.

18:32.138 --> 18:33.938
I love small towns,
you know.

18:33.939 --> 18:35.106
I remember one time...
(Loud rock music blares)

18:41.913 --> 18:42.913
You wanna buy who?

18:42.914 --> 18:44.381
Apollo.

18:44.382 --> 18:45.682
He was one of the horses
on the truck

18:45.683 --> 18:47.017
that stopped
at Heartland.

18:47.018 --> 18:48.519
I think we've already sold
that horse.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.321
Yeah, I know.
To a slaughterhouse.

18:51.322 --> 18:53.557
I'll get the manager.

18:55.193 --> 18:58.662
It amazes me you people
can sleep at night.

19:01.966 --> 19:05.436
So you wanna buy Apollo,
huh?

19:05.437 --> 19:07.271
Actually, I wanna buy
the whole truckload.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.439
<i>Ed:</i> <i>(Sleazy chuckle)</i> <i>You're...</i>

19:08.440 --> 19:10.441
You're a regular mother Teresa,
aren't ya?

19:10.442 --> 19:12.175
Look, I will, uh...

19:12.176 --> 19:14.477
I'll match whatever
the slaughterhouse paid you.

19:14.478 --> 19:16.046
Agh. No good.

19:17.347 --> 19:18.748
I want double.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.017
Really?

19:21.018 --> 19:22.218
Yeah.

19:22.219 --> 19:24.153
Two grand oughta
do the trick,

19:24.154 --> 19:26.422
and I only take cash.

19:30.661 --> 19:32.929
Number's on the card.

19:32.930 --> 19:36.866
You give me a call
when you got the money.

19:39.670 --> 19:41.938
Dad, come on.
Let's go.

19:41.939 --> 19:44.106
Ah, why don't we stay
for a bit?

19:44.107 --> 19:45.908
Get ourselves a cold drink.

19:45.909 --> 19:47.843
I need to get back.

19:47.844 --> 19:49.712
Come on,
sit down.

19:49.713 --> 19:50.913
Order whatever you want.
It's on me.

20:01.457 --> 20:02.858
Not hungry.

20:05.762 --> 20:06.762
Hey.

20:11.134 --> 20:12.101
(Chuckles)

20:13.970 --> 20:15.703
Who's that?

20:15.704 --> 20:17.572
Ah, that's nobody.

20:17.573 --> 20:18.906
That's just a girl
I know.

20:18.907 --> 20:21.009
Well, don't be rude.
Invite her over.

20:23.412 --> 20:24.479
Dad,
what're you doing?

20:24.480 --> 20:26.481
What, are you afraid your
old man's gonna embarrass you?

20:26.482 --> 20:28.283
Too late for that.

20:28.284 --> 20:30.084
Hey, Ty.

20:30.085 --> 20:31.052
Hey.

20:33.489 --> 20:34.489
(Awkward half laugh)

20:36.192 --> 20:38.160
Well, I'd wait for Ty
to introduce me,

20:38.161 --> 20:40.162
<i>but he's a little tongue-tied</i>
<i>right now.</i>

20:40.163 --> 20:42.330
I'm his dad,
Brad Borden.

20:42.331 --> 20:44.032
One-half the reason
why he's so good looking.

20:44.033 --> 20:45.033
(With a laugh)
Oh.

20:45.034 --> 20:46.167
Uh, Kit Bailey.

20:46.168 --> 20:47.801
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Borden.

20:47.802 --> 20:50.037
We were just about to order
ourselves a couple of cold drinks.

20:50.038 --> 20:51.305
Why don't you join us?

20:51.306 --> 20:53.240
Uh, dad, I think she's got
better things to do.

20:53.241 --> 20:54.542
Uh, no, actually,

20:54.543 --> 20:56.810
I was just heading
for some ice cream;

20:56.811 --> 20:58.612
Might as well eat it
with you guys.

20:58.613 --> 20:59.980
There you go.

20:59.981 --> 21:01.282
All right.

21:06.921 --> 21:08.289
Val:
Ashley,

21:08.290 --> 21:09.756
right on time.

21:10.825 --> 21:12.993
Uh, gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet my daughter,

21:12.994 --> 21:14.127
Ashley Stanton.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.830
Ashley?!

21:16.831 --> 21:18.298
What're you do...

21:18.299 --> 21:20.100
Ashley?!

21:20.101 --> 21:21.467
Ashley, don't!
(Stunned gasp)

21:21.468 --> 21:22.435
(Glass shatters)

21:24.271 --> 21:26.206
What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

21:26.207 --> 21:28.641
Ashley: That's for making
me drive an economy car.

21:28.642 --> 21:30.476
Ashley, don't you...
Nooo!

21:31.946 --> 21:34.715
(Glass shatters,
Val yelps, stunned)

21:35.750 --> 21:37.751
And that's for what
you did to Apollo!

21:43.958 --> 21:44.925
Konnichiwa.

21:53.796 --> 21:56.998
Amy found Apollo
on a meat truck!

21:57.733 --> 21:59.468
Don't blame me.

21:59.469 --> 22:01.102
I sold him to
a reputable horse dealer.

22:01.103 --> 22:02.704
What happened after that's
not my fault.

22:02.705 --> 22:03.738
Buy him back!

22:03.739 --> 22:05.640
Oh, I'll do no such thing.

22:05.641 --> 22:07.476
Fine. Then first thing
in the morning,

22:07.477 --> 22:08.510
I'm moving out.

22:08.511 --> 22:09.511
Like hell you are.

22:09.512 --> 22:10.645
Yeah,
that's right, mom.

22:10.646 --> 22:12.914
I'm leaving you
just like everybody else!

22:12.915 --> 22:14.115
What?!

22:14.116 --> 22:16.518
Yeah. Jesse couldn't wait
to go to boarding school

22:16.519 --> 22:18.052
so he wouldn't have to deal
with your crap.

22:18.053 --> 22:19.454
And dad?

22:19.455 --> 22:20.489
Well,
he would've left you too,

22:20.490 --> 22:23.024
if he hadn't died first.

22:23.025 --> 22:25.193
(Hard smack,
Ashley gasps)

22:26.929 --> 22:28.296
(Stifles a sob)

22:28.297 --> 22:29.864
If you leave here,

22:29.865 --> 22:32.165
don't you expect
a penny from me.

22:32.166 --> 22:33.734
Your allowance,

22:33.735 --> 22:36.203
your credit car...
(Stifles a sob)

22:36.204 --> 22:39.139
I'll cut you off,
Ashley.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.775
I hope you and your horses
will be happy together.

22:48.349 --> 22:49.550
(Whispering)
All right, he's gone.

22:49.551 --> 22:50.985
Now's your chance
to escape.

22:50.986 --> 22:52.152
(Chuckles)

22:52.153 --> 22:53.954
Your dad's not so bad.

22:55.056 --> 22:57.725
Yeah. It's actually starting
to weird me out.

22:57.726 --> 22:59.960
I keep waiting for him to ask
for like kidney or something.

22:59.961 --> 23:00.828
Both:
(Laugh)

23:04.298 --> 23:05.332
You know,
I'm kinda glad

23:05.333 --> 23:06.733
that he asked me
to join you.

23:06.734 --> 23:07.834
Really?

23:07.835 --> 23:09.269
Mm-hm.
After the rodeo,

23:09.270 --> 23:12.339
I was sort of hoping
you would call me.

23:12.340 --> 23:15.308
You never gave me
your number.

23:16.944 --> 23:18.545
(Phone keypad beeps)

23:21.715 --> 23:23.583
There. Now I have.

23:23.584 --> 23:26.019
So no more lame excuses.

23:27.821 --> 23:30.557
Tell your dad
I said thanks.

23:35.662 --> 23:37.263
(Sighs)

23:37.264 --> 23:38.964
You're welcome.

23:44.204 --> 23:45.737
Amy:
That's great, Lou!

23:45.738 --> 23:49.608
And where exactly do you plan
on putting all these horses?

23:49.609 --> 23:50.676
We'll make room.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.346
Don't look at me
like that grandpa.

23:54.347 --> 23:55.948
The dude ranch
has been picking up

23:55.949 --> 23:57.550
and we need more horses
for trail rides.

23:57.551 --> 23:58.884
I see.

23:58.885 --> 24:01.720
So it was purely
a business decision.

24:03.590 --> 24:05.724
<i>Brad:</i> <i>(Clears throat)</i>
<i>Well, I think it's great, Lou.</i>

24:05.725 --> 24:06.791
That was one delivery

24:06.792 --> 24:08.226
I was not looking forward
to making.

24:09.828 --> 24:11.329
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>So, Brad.</i>

24:11.330 --> 24:14.099
Ty hasn't talked very much
about you.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.801
All I've heard is you're good
at making things disappear.

24:16.802 --> 24:17.902
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Mallory...</i>

24:21.440 --> 24:22.974
- You wanna see a trick?
- It's okay, dad.

24:22.975 --> 24:24.342
I think everyone's
pretty tired.

24:24.343 --> 24:26.211
Nah, come on.
I want to see a trick.

24:26.212 --> 24:27.378
Yeah?

24:27.379 --> 24:30.781
Your average everyday
handkerchief. All right?

24:30.782 --> 24:33.084
Ty used to love this trick
when he was a kid.

24:33.085 --> 24:35.019
He used to think
I was some kind of magician.

24:35.020 --> 24:39.156
Now, what we do is we stuff
that down in there.

24:39.157 --> 24:40.657
All right?
Now...

24:40.658 --> 24:43.293
I need you to blow
on that.

24:45.530 --> 24:46.796
It's not bad,

24:46.797 --> 24:48.198
if you're a five-year-old
at a birthday party.

24:48.199 --> 24:51.201
Really?
Check your pocket.

24:51.202 --> 24:52.169
Yeah, right.

24:55.673 --> 24:56.906
No way!

24:56.907 --> 24:59.476
Amy, Mallory and Brad:
(Chuckling)

25:04.649 --> 25:06.583
Ty: I can't believe
she bought them.

25:06.584 --> 25:09.752
Amy: Deep down, Lou's
just a big marshmallow.

25:09.753 --> 25:12.321
Ty: Who would've ever thought you'd
end up owning Ashley Stanton's horse?

25:12.322 --> 25:13.822
Amy:
(Laughs)

25:13.823 --> 25:16.058
It's been a weird day.

25:16.059 --> 25:17.092
You're telling me.

25:17.093 --> 25:19.162
I spent the whole day
with my dad.

25:19.163 --> 25:21.030
And that's not even
the weird part.

25:21.031 --> 25:22.131
What was?

25:23.167 --> 25:25.301
It was kind of okay.

25:27.371 --> 25:30.373
Sometimes people
surprise us,

25:30.374 --> 25:33.075
even when we've given up
on them.

25:34.110 --> 25:36.479
You really believe that?

25:37.548 --> 25:39.482
Yeah. I really do.

25:46.022 --> 25:46.855
I should probably...

25:46.856 --> 25:48.423
Yeah, me too.

25:51.995 --> 25:53.328
Good night.

25:55.999 --> 25:56.965
(Sighs)

25:59.535 --> 26:03.038
Hey, there, pretty girl.
You're looking a lot better.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.639
<i>Sorry about the rough ride</i>
<i>earlier,</i>

26:04.640 --> 26:07.876
<i>but everything's</i>
<i>gonna be okay now.</i>

26:10.180 --> 26:11.946
So, I guess I saved them,
didn't I?

26:13.182 --> 26:14.215
Yeah, well, don't let it
go to your head.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.619
They're gonna need names now,
right?

26:18.620 --> 26:21.222
The warm-blood one's
Apollo.

26:21.223 --> 26:22.090
But she doesn't have
a name yet.

26:24.392 --> 26:25.993
Well...

26:25.994 --> 26:27.995
What about... Lily?

26:30.866 --> 26:32.800
I don't think mom would like
the idea of a...

26:32.801 --> 26:34.635
<i>Horse being named after her.</i>

26:36.171 --> 26:37.872
You know, I wish I could've
been there for her, Ty.

26:37.873 --> 26:40.708
I really do.
And you're right,

26:40.709 --> 26:42.943
it does keep me
up at night...

26:42.944 --> 26:44.477
<i>Thinking about what I could've</i>
<i>done different,</i>

26:44.478 --> 26:46.446
<i>thinking about you.</i>

26:47.514 --> 26:49.449
That's why I don't sleep
anymore. I just drive.

26:52.253 --> 26:56.156
Ah, whatever. You don't wanna
name the horse Lily,

26:56.157 --> 26:57.157
I understand.

26:58.159 --> 26:59.525
No.

26:59.526 --> 27:01.427
It's a good name.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.900
Ty, I don't expect you
to forgive me,

27:10.104 --> 27:14.273
but I do hope I can be
part of your life again.

27:15.275 --> 27:17.376
I'm making, uh, a run

27:17.377 --> 27:20.445
down to the States
in a couple of weeks.

27:20.446 --> 27:21.713
Why don't you
come with me?

27:21.714 --> 27:23.983
You know, get a chance
to see the Grand Canyon.

27:23.984 --> 27:25.050
(Chuckles softly)

27:26.452 --> 27:27.419
Uh...

27:28.688 --> 27:30.756
I don't know.
I um...

27:30.757 --> 27:32.491
Ah, you don't have
to decide now.

27:32.492 --> 27:33.859
Just uh...

27:36.396 --> 27:39.598
Promise me
you'll think about it.

27:42.903 --> 27:44.235
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

27:45.437 --> 27:47.906
Look, how'd you get my number
anyway?

27:48.941 --> 27:51.009
No, I haven't forgotten.

27:51.877 --> 27:55.079
I just need a few more days.
You'll get your money.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.681
Yes, all of it.
Fine.

27:58.350 --> 27:59.951
Oh...

27:59.952 --> 28:01.319
Jack. Uh...

28:03.189 --> 28:04.522
What ya doin' up?

28:04.523 --> 28:06.657
I could ask you
the same thing.

28:06.658 --> 28:08.059
(Nervous breath)

28:08.060 --> 28:10.328
Work stuff.

28:10.329 --> 28:11.762
My boss is a real hard-ass.

28:11.763 --> 28:14.332
Nothing I can't handle...

28:16.000 --> 28:17.267
You know.

28:19.003 --> 28:20.337
'Night, Jack.

28:20.338 --> 28:22.706
I hope...

28:22.707 --> 28:25.175
Whatever problems
you're having at "work"

28:25.176 --> 28:27.845
don't become Ty's problems.

28:28.880 --> 28:29.847
Yeah.

28:31.415 --> 28:33.616
Look, I understand
your concern, Jack,

28:33.617 --> 28:36.086
but I got...
I got everything under control.

28:36.087 --> 28:37.587
You better.

28:37.588 --> 28:40.023
'Cause I've got 600 acres
of land, a shovel,

28:40.024 --> 28:42.092
and you've already seen
my work with a rifle.

28:42.093 --> 28:46.628
Believe me, you do not want
to get on my bad side.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.039
Thanks, Amy.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.941
I'm so relieved.

28:58.942 --> 29:00.409
I'll be right over.

29:00.410 --> 29:01.377
Okay. Bye.

29:03.914 --> 29:05.915
Soraya!
Put on your fast pants on.

29:05.916 --> 29:07.616
I don't have all day!

29:12.756 --> 29:14.190
Declined.

29:14.191 --> 29:15.491
That's impossible.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.392
Look, you made a mistake.
Try it again.

29:17.393 --> 29:20.628
I ran it through
twice already.

29:20.629 --> 29:22.297
Soraya!

29:22.298 --> 29:23.398
Look, you didn't have
to do that.

29:23.399 --> 29:25.633
I'll pay you tomorrow.

29:25.634 --> 29:27.702
Tomorrow's a long time
from now, Ashley.

29:27.703 --> 29:29.304
Meanwhile,
I've got a full diner,

29:29.305 --> 29:32.173
no help, and loads of dirty dishes
piling up in the kitchen.

29:32.174 --> 29:33.511
(Incredulous breath)

29:33.674 --> 29:36.211
You want me to...

29:36.212 --> 29:38.280
(Stunned)
Wash the dishes?

29:38.281 --> 29:40.982
You can start
with this one.

29:42.818 --> 29:44.152
Thank you.

29:46.122 --> 29:47.055
(Water sprays)

29:48.189 --> 29:49.723
I'd give anything
for a snow cone.

29:49.724 --> 29:51.525
Uh, I'd give anything
for ice cream.

29:51.526 --> 29:52.859
I'd give anything
for January.

29:52.860 --> 29:54.929
Yeah, and I'd give anything
for ear plugs.

29:54.930 --> 29:56.496
Somebody's cranky.

29:56.497 --> 29:58.265
Yeah, you're damn right
I'm cranky!

29:58.266 --> 29:59.333
Six more horses

29:59.334 --> 30:00.901
means six times
as much work.

30:00.902 --> 30:02.536
Ty:

31:27.319 --> 31:29.020
Maybe we could do that
one day...

31:29.021 --> 31:30.421
When I'm ready.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.825
I, I'd like that a lot.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.295
All right.

31:38.296 --> 31:39.296
Uh, hey.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.769
Any idea when that day
might be?

31:45.938 --> 31:47.005
I don't know.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.608
I'll let you know though.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.553
(Car whirs)

32:04.756 --> 32:07.624
(Engine begins knocking
and ticking)

32:10.294 --> 32:12.829
(Engine chugs slowly to a halt)

32:16.000 --> 32:18.368
(Ignition fails to turn over)
Come on.

32:18.369 --> 32:19.570
Work with me.

32:19.571 --> 32:20.904
(Hits panel)

32:20.905 --> 32:22.305
(Frustrated sigh)

32:22.306 --> 32:23.506
It's okay,
it's okay.

32:24.541 --> 32:26.008
Okay...

32:26.009 --> 32:27.409
(Ignition fails to turn)

32:27.410 --> 32:29.679
(Wolf howls in the distance)

32:32.449 --> 32:33.549
(Drawer opens)

32:36.186 --> 32:37.620
(Drawer snaps shut)

32:37.621 --> 32:41.123
(Thudding within the stalls,
horse nickers)

32:43.326 --> 32:44.560
(Papers rustle)

33:02.845 --> 33:04.278
(Envelope rustles)

33:09.151 --> 33:10.418
(Sigh of relief)

33:19.996 --> 33:22.463
(Truck engine revs
and rumbles)

33:28.770 --> 33:31.471
(Truck rumbles away)

33:50.471 --> 33:51.337
<i>I don't wanna talk about it,</i>
<i>Amy.</i>

33:51.338 --> 33:52.372
I'm glad he's gone.

33:52.373 --> 33:53.506
I don't believe you.

33:53.507 --> 33:54.740
Look! It's like
your grampa said.

33:54.741 --> 33:55.774
You might want someone
to change,

33:55.775 --> 33:56.709
but that doesn't
make it happen.

33:56.710 --> 33:57.710
I'm sorry he left.

33:57.711 --> 33:58.911
I don't want your pity,
Amy.

34:00.314 --> 34:02.882
The money I withdrew
for the horses...

34:02.883 --> 34:04.183
It's gone!

34:07.454 --> 34:09.355
I guess my dad couldn't resist
one last trick.

34:13.994 --> 34:15.293
(Engine rumbles)

34:22.335 --> 34:23.435
(Horse grunts)

34:41.588 --> 34:43.022
(Knocks on window)

34:50.862 --> 34:52.264
Car trouble?

34:52.264 --> 34:54.831
No.
Just a rest stop.

34:54.833 --> 34:57.369
Inspired by a lack of gas
and credit.

34:57.370 --> 34:59.371
It's a long story.

34:59.372 --> 35:01.573
Uh, you've got a...

35:02.575 --> 35:03.975
(Wrapper rustles)

35:07.447 --> 35:09.614
(Small, sheepish laugh)

35:09.615 --> 35:12.117
Did you need
a ride home?

35:14.320 --> 35:15.653
Yeah, sure.

35:16.689 --> 35:17.922
Come on, Ed.

35:17.923 --> 35:21.024
I just need a few more days
to get the money and...

35:21.025 --> 35:24.061
Yes, I know I said today,
but...

35:24.929 --> 35:25.829
Fine.

35:26.664 --> 35:28.599
What did he say?

35:28.600 --> 35:30.634
He said that...

35:30.635 --> 35:32.035
If we don't have the money
by the time he gets here,

35:32.036 --> 35:33.304
he's taking the horses.

35:33.305 --> 35:34.905
No, he can't do that.

35:34.906 --> 35:37.174
I'm not gonna let him.

35:40.512 --> 35:42.213
Hi. (Clears throat)
Mark?

35:42.214 --> 35:43.180
It's Lou.

35:50.388 --> 35:51.688
I'm sorry.
This is weird, right?

35:51.689 --> 35:53.423
(Awkward laugh)

35:54.691 --> 35:56.959
Something bothering you,
Ty?

35:56.960 --> 36:00.730
You sounded sort of upset
on the phone.

36:00.731 --> 36:02.965
You don't mind if we just
sit here, do you?

36:02.966 --> 36:04.634
Things are a little crazy
at Heartland right now

36:04.635 --> 36:07.637
and uh...
I just need to get away.

36:07.638 --> 36:09.272
Go someplace quiet.

36:10.341 --> 36:13.610
Nobody's ever taken me up here
just to sit.

36:13.611 --> 36:16.446
It's kinda refreshing.

36:16.447 --> 36:20.550
Probably a really good way
to scare someone like you off.

36:20.551 --> 36:22.285
Yeah, probably.

36:30.426 --> 36:34.229
It's a good thing
I don't scare too easy.

36:38.034 --> 36:38.900
Ed:
Get up.

36:40.403 --> 36:41.403
Why isn't he here?

36:41.404 --> 36:43.038
He'll be here.

36:49.712 --> 36:51.112
Hey!

36:51.113 --> 36:52.881
What're you doing
with my horse?

36:52.882 --> 36:54.716
I don't know what kind of glue
you've been sniffing, blondy,

36:54.717 --> 36:57.051
this horse belongs to me.

36:57.919 --> 37:00.754
I'm, I'm sorry, Ashley.
We couldn't buy him.

37:00.755 --> 37:02.723
Get your hands
off my horse!

37:02.724 --> 37:04.992
(Laughs)
You gotta be kidding me.

37:04.993 --> 37:07.961
You do not want
to mess with me.

37:14.836 --> 37:16.470
(Engine rumbles)

37:16.471 --> 37:18.506
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Ah, perfect timing, officer.</i>

37:18.507 --> 37:20.441
There's a lunatic
trying to steal my horse.

37:21.443 --> 37:23.678
Well, actually,

37:23.679 --> 37:25.112
I'm here to see you, Ed.

37:25.113 --> 37:27.347
Ed: I'm only taking back
what's rightfully mine.

37:27.348 --> 37:29.382
I had a chat
with one of your employees.

37:29.383 --> 37:30.450
He had some interesting
things to say

37:30.451 --> 37:32.319
about the way
you do business.

37:32.320 --> 37:36.123
I don't know what you're
talking about, officer.

37:38.026 --> 37:40.027
I think you do, Ed.

37:40.028 --> 37:41.862
What did you tell him,
you old coot?

37:41.863 --> 37:42.996
I told him
you treat them horses

37:42.997 --> 37:44.698
the same way
you treat me.

37:44.699 --> 37:45.966
Like crap.

37:45.967 --> 37:48.068
I thought ma and I raised you
better than that.

37:48.069 --> 37:49.203
He's your father?

37:50.338 --> 37:52.339
This is what you call
tough love.

37:52.340 --> 37:53.707
Take him away, officer.

37:53.708 --> 37:56.343
Ed: (Stammering nervously)
No need to be hasty.

37:56.344 --> 37:59.445
I'd be more than happy to give
the horses if she came up the money.

37:59.446 --> 38:00.546
Cheque's in the mail.

38:03.217 --> 38:06.585
You heard the lady.
Cheque's in the mail.

38:06.586 --> 38:08.520
I think we're done here.

38:08.521 --> 38:09.655
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Fine.</i>

38:10.690 --> 38:11.791
(Nervous gasp)

38:23.670 --> 38:24.703
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>I uh...</i>

38:25.739 --> 38:28.940
Heard about your predicament.

38:28.941 --> 38:30.776
If you need a place to stay
for a few nights,

38:30.777 --> 38:33.344
you're welcome to sleep
in one of the cabins.

38:33.345 --> 38:35.113
I'm willing to earn my keep,
Jack.

38:35.114 --> 38:37.682
And uh... I could work
at the dude ranch;

38:37.683 --> 38:40.185
I'd make a great VP
of guest services.

38:40.186 --> 38:43.054
You might want to lower
your expectations a little.

38:43.055 --> 38:46.758
More along the lines of...
VP of outhouse scrubbing.

38:47.794 --> 38:49.327
I'll take it.

38:51.130 --> 38:52.130
Uh...

38:52.131 --> 38:53.498
You know, I'm...

38:53.499 --> 38:56.833
I'm gonna have to talk to
"you know who" eventually, but...

38:57.371 --> 38:58.804
...in due time.

38:58.805 --> 38:59.605
Okay.

39:06.611 --> 39:08.712
Thanks for talking to him.

39:10.315 --> 39:13.117
You, uh, really saved
my ass today.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.652
Guess I can't resist
a damsel in distress.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.488
Or a damsel with a candy wrapper
stuck in her hair.

39:18.489 --> 39:19.656
(Laughs)

39:19.657 --> 39:20.958
Come on.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.059
I'll give you a lift
to the cabins.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.994
Okay. Um...

39:24.996 --> 39:27.064
Can you give me a minute?

39:27.065 --> 39:28.065
Yeah.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.033
Thanks.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.536
<i>Looking for something,</i>
<i>Jack?</i>

39:49.537 --> 39:50.805
(Clears throat)

39:51.807 --> 39:53.507
I'm just uh...

39:53.508 --> 39:54.775
Just getting a cold drink.

39:54.776 --> 39:56.476
Yeah, right.
I know a fridge infraction

39:56.477 --> 39:57.978
when I see one.

39:57.979 --> 39:58.979
(Laughs)

40:00.615 --> 40:02.917
Well, maybe your idea
about an air conditioner

40:02.918 --> 40:06.086
wasn't such a bad one
after all.

40:06.087 --> 40:07.387
I'm over it.

40:07.388 --> 40:08.856
You're over it?

40:08.857 --> 40:10.291
I was watching
the weather network;

40:10.292 --> 40:11.859
Supposed to cool off
overnight.

40:11.860 --> 40:14.928
(Sighs) Well, I am
relieved to hear that.

40:18.632 --> 40:20.266
You wouldn't have really
thrown me in the pond

40:20.267 --> 40:22.936
with the leeches,
right, Jack?

40:23.938 --> 40:26.873
Not even if you were on fire.

40:34.548 --> 40:35.715
(Clears throat)

40:37.751 --> 40:38.718
No.

40:40.321 --> 40:41.721
"No" what?

40:41.722 --> 40:43.656
No, I don't accept
your resignation.

40:43.657 --> 40:44.823
(Sighs)
Come on, Lou.

40:44.824 --> 40:46.091
You know this isn't working.

40:46.092 --> 40:48.193
Look, maybe you and I may
be broken, Scott,

40:48.194 --> 40:49.661
but Heartland isn't.

40:49.662 --> 40:50.963
You're an exceptional
veterinarian

40:50.964 --> 40:53.131
and you make this place
better.

40:53.132 --> 40:56.869
Grandpa and Amy,
they-they need you here...

40:57.871 --> 40:59.371
I need you here.

41:00.406 --> 41:02.341
So...

41:02.342 --> 41:04.343
Please don't quit.

41:11.450 --> 41:14.886
Do you really think
I'm exceptional?

41:16.121 --> 41:17.088
(Half laughs)

41:28.867 --> 41:31.869
(Screen door opens
and snaps shut)

41:31.870 --> 41:34.071
Something came for you
in the mail today.

41:34.072 --> 41:36.140
It's from your dad.

41:41.579 --> 41:43.847
Whatever's in that envelope,

41:43.848 --> 41:45.049
I want you to know
you got a lot of people

41:45.050 --> 41:48.418
in your corner here, Ty.
Don't you forget that.

41:52.756 --> 41:53.689
Val:
Sayonara.

41:56.560 --> 41:57.994
Oh, good boy!

41:57.995 --> 41:59.529
He's hungry.

41:59.530 --> 42:01.664
Are you hungry?
Huh? Huh?

42:01.665 --> 42:03.433
(Laughs)
For grain?

42:03.434 --> 42:05.402
(Laughs)
