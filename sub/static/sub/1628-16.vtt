with Cora to ﬁnd Gold’s dagger.

The dagger controls him.

To make my daughter the queen.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.519
Well, she ruined my slippers.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.233
I don't think the girl meant any harm.

Tell me about this knife of yours.

03:31.128 --> 03:35.212
Cora and Regina, if they do have it,
they can make you do anything?

I'm not... I'm not wicked.

04:26.851 --> 04:29.843
It's not an enchanted box.
It's a phone tap.

I don't care!
What matters is, they've been warned.

CORA: More than injured, I'd say.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.781
He's dying.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.950
And when his name disappears,

04:47.371 --> 04:51.660
all of that power of his
will just boil off into the air,

04:53.169 --> 04:54.830
and there will be no new Dark One.

04:55.296 --> 05:00.006
Okay, so we have to use him
to get Henry back before he dies.

05:00.134 --> 05:03.797
Not in his condition.
I don't wanna kill him faster.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.554
No, there are no other options.

05:07.641 --> 05:12.556
l have to stab him with this knife
and take his power as my own.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.512

there is nothing I won't be able to do.

05:22.448 --> 05:25.736
But Henry's never going to forgive that.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.161
And the whole point of this is...

05:32.249 --> 05:34.706
Wait, what is the point of all this?

05:35.503 --> 05:37.164
To protect our family.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.916
Or you gaining your power?

05:41.425 --> 05:44.917
Whatever power I gain is for us.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.137

30:47.430 --> 30:49.091
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

30:49.390 --> 30:50.425
Emma, please.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.174
Who's Belle?

30:53.602 --> 30:54.978
Your dad's girlfriend.

30:59.483 --> 31:02.270
Mr. Gold, I... I told you before,

31:02.361 --> 31:04.773
I... I don't remember you.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.562
I... I... I know, I know.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.107
It'sjust, uh...

31:09.410 --> 31:12.152
(EXHALES) Sweetheart, I am dying.

31:14.165 --> 31:15.450
Oh. I'm, Uh...

31:16.751 --> 31:18.287
I'm... I'm so sorry.

31:19.003 --> 31:22.712
I know that you're confused about
who you are.

31:24.008 --> 31:26.090
So I’m going to tell you.

31:29.805 --> 31:34.674
You are a hero who helped your people.

31:36.437 --> 31:38.143
You’re a beautiful woman

31:40.691 --> 31:42.977
who loved an ugly man.

31:44.612 --> 31:47.775
Really, really loved me.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.782
You ﬁnd goodness in others,

31:53.329 --> 31:56.696
and when it’s not there, you create it.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.410
You make me wanna go back.

32:04.090 --> 32:08.333
Back to the best version of me.

32:10.805 --> 32:12.011
That never happened before.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.266
So when you look in the mirror

32:19.271 --> 32:21.262
and you don't know who you are...

32:23.442 --> 32:24.943
That's who you are.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.393
(CRYING)

32:31.700 --> 32:34.442
(WHISPERS) Thank you, Belle.

32:36.372 --> 32:37.361
(BEEP)

32:37.456 --> 32:39.037
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

32:42.753 --> 32:44.334
(CLEARS THROAT)

32:45.214 --> 32:47.455
Didn't know you had that in you.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.586
Oh, lam full of love.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.719
I've spent a lifetime looking for you.

32:56.517 --> 32:58.382
For a chance to say I love you.

33:02.439 --> 33:03.975
And I'm sorry.

33:07.611 --> 33:08.942
(SNIFFLES)

33:14.577 --> 33:17.535
I didn't think
you would go back on our deal.

33:19.623 --> 33:22.035
I just made the wrong choice.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.457
May I?

33:34.346 --> 33:36.598
(VOICE BREAKS) I'm still angry.

33:37.433 --> 33:38.843
I know.

33:45.774 --> 33:46.763
(INHALES DEEPLY)

34:01.040 --> 34:02.029
(GASPS)

34:05.127 --> 34:07.368
You have no right to be here.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.704
And you have no right to that!

34:13.093 --> 34:15.425
I was going to give it to you.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.215
What?

34:17.348 --> 34:20.806
She can't love you, you know.
She doesn't have her heart.

34:21.352 --> 34:22.637
With it, maybe she can.

34:24.647 --> 34:27.855
That's why you've never felt
she loved you.

34:27.942 --> 34:31.730
She doesn't have her heart. But I do.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.693
You're doing this for me?

34:33.822 --> 34:35.687
Think about it.

34:35.783 --> 34:37.648
What would happen
if Cora had her heart back?

34:37.743 --> 34:39.199
Back inside her?

34:39.328 --> 34:41.990
She told me she took it out
to protect herself.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.446
And did it work?

34:44.375 --> 34:47.367
The person she was before,
do you think that person survived?

34:49.630 --> 34:53.214
She can't love, so she can't love you.

34:56.470 --> 34:59.086
She always wanted the best for me.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.097
(VOICE BREAKS) That's love.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.351
(WHISPERS) Imagine real love.

35:07.481 --> 35:08.721
You'd have a mother,

35:09.024 --> 35:12.391
and a start on making a family
Henry could be a part of.

35:15.739 --> 35:18.446
Or you could have her be the Dark One.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.282
The choice is yours.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.218
I was starting to grow concerned.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.513
Well, here I am.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.237
Something's not right.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.071
Yes, you're correct.

36:03.370 --> 36:07.158
What happened?
Couldn't you take the King's heart?

36:07.291 --> 36:09.282
No, I was able to do it.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.877
I chose not to.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.496
Ah.

36:19.219 --> 36:23.383
I'm sorry, my dear Rumple.
I'm not going with you.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.717
You see, I have a wedding to go to.

36:29.772 --> 36:30.978
My own.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.234
Whose heart is in the box?

36:38.405 --> 36:39.861
Don't make this harder...

36:39.990 --> 36:42.948
You lied to me. Whose heart?

36:45.871 --> 36:47.327
Mine.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.622
I had to.

36:50.709 --> 36:55.544
You told me not to let anything stop me
until they're on their knees.

36:58.592 --> 37:01.129
My heart was stopping me.

37:06.433 --> 37:09.550
You never loved me. Never!

37:09.645 --> 37:11.431
You're not getting away with this.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.766
We had a contract! I'll take your baby!

37:14.149 --> 37:17.016
You changed the contract, Rumple.

37:18.195 --> 37:20.811
You only get your own child.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.486
And any baby I have,

37:28.372 --> 37:30.363
it won't be yours.

37:47.307 --> 37:48.683

37:55.899 --> 37:58.231
(PANTING) Are you okay? Are you...

38:03.782 --> 38:05.568
What did you do?

38:06.243 --> 38:08.700
(BREATHING HEAVILY) YOU were right.

38:09.872 --> 38:11.408
This isn't me.

You two, out of the way.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.474
(WEAKLY) A vision told me about you.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.983
Told me this day would come.

38:47.451 --> 38:49.817
But it didn't tell me everything.

38:51.038 --> 38:54.201
(WHISPERS) It didn't tell me
what I really wanted to know.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.630
And what's that?

39:03.175 --> 39:05.086
Did you ever love me?

39:10.474 --> 39:13.432
Why do you think
I had to rip my own heart out?

39:14.311 --> 39:16.142
(LABORED BREATHING)

39:19.441 --> 39:21.352
You were my weakness.

Tell me, daughter, what is her name?

40:20.168 --> 40:22.500
Her name is Regina.

You did this.
