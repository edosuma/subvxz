06:01.929 --> 06:06.167
<i>The people of the world
are more or less the same.</i>

06:06.200 --> 06:09.837
<i>Though we may come in
different shapes and colors,</i>

06:09.871 --> 06:13.406
<i>we all share
the same inheritance.</i>

06:13.440 --> 06:18.746
<i>And we all have our back
stories, and our secrets.</i>

06:18.779 --> 06:20.882
<i>Like this man, running along</i>

06:20.915 --> 06:23.184
<i>the river Scheldt in Antwerp.</i>

06:23.217 --> 06:28.089
<i>What is he running from?
What is he trying to escape?</i>

06:29.891 --> 06:33.661
<i>Even though evolution
might seem to mature us,</i>

06:33.694 --> 06:35.763
<i>there are still
parts of our brain</i>

06:35.796 --> 06:38.866
<i>that belong to
our reptile ancestors.</i>

06:38.900 --> 06:41.802
<i>Although we've convinced
ourselves that hate,</i>

06:41.836 --> 06:45.706
<i>revenge, and nemesis
belong to the past,</i>

06:45.740 --> 06:50.845
<i>our ancient ancestor's blood
still runs in our veins,</i>

06:50.878 --> 06:54.081
<i>whether we like it or not.</i>

07:17.672 --> 07:19.874
Feels like
a bloody good campaign.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.242
As usual, you'd have to say.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.778
After holiday,
we'll get started on images.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.813
I'll mail over a few suggestions
for photographers.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.783
Excellent. Have a great
holiday, and we'll be in touch.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.118
- Thank you, guys. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

07:38.092 --> 07:39.994
You're a genius Henry,
you know that?

07:40.027 --> 07:41.595
Well, I don't know about that.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.564
Haven't we already discussed
your raises?

07:46.767 --> 07:48.903
Five more days, guys,
can't wait.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.071
- Until the holidays, you mean?
- Yeah.

07:50.104 --> 07:51.539
John, we're waiting for you.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.808
Damn it.
I love being at work.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.576
Come on.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.578
So what are your plans?

07:57.611 --> 07:58.879
For the holiday?

07:58.913 --> 08:01.215
We've rented a small house
in Cote d'Azur.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.552
We're gonna head down there,
do lots of long walks on the beach,

08:04.585 --> 08:07.221
piles of books, lots of good
food, that sort of thing.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.291
- Sounds decent.
- Well...

08:10.324 --> 08:11.826
In case you wondered,

08:11.859 --> 08:14.095
we'll be damp proofing
the basement.

08:14.128 --> 08:17.631
Consider that when you complain
about sand in your swimming trunks.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.653
- Hi, Henry.
- Hey, Paula.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.055
- Yeah.
- How are you? Paula...

08:41.088 --> 08:42.890
- Polans... Polanski.
- Polanski.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.026
- Yeah, how are you?
- I'm good.

08:45.059 --> 08:47.661
Wow. It's gotta be
ten years since that...

08:47.695 --> 08:50.765
- Uh, almost exactly. Yeah.
- Wow.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.299
Do you live, uh,
here in Maardam?

08:52.333 --> 08:53.701
No, I live in Antwerp now.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.637
I'm just here
on a couple of days work.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.938
Oh.

09:01.776 --> 09:03.744
- So, Film Academy?
- Yeah.

09:03.778 --> 09:05.946
Mainly because I didn't know
what else to do with myself,

09:05.980 --> 09:09.683
but, uh,
I got in for whatever reason.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.319
Well, to make documentaries,
which is what you're doing now, isn't it?

09:12.353 --> 09:14.855
I think I've seen
one of them on ARTE.

09:14.889 --> 09:17.224
- Uh, <i>Roman Beggars.</i>
- <i>Roman,</i> that's it.

09:17.258 --> 09:19.293
- Won an award.
- Did it?

09:19.326 --> 09:20.861
- Yeah.
- Good for you. That's great.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.897
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Well done.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.666
I haven't actually been back
to Kaalbringen since I've...

09:25.699 --> 09:27.868
Well, I stopped being a teacher.
Wasn't really my thing.

09:27.902 --> 09:29.637
- So...
- Yeah, I know.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.106
You work for one of those big,
uh, advertising agencies.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.841
That's... that's right.
How do you...

09:33.874 --> 09:36.243
The reunion.
Oh, you're on the mailing list.

09:36.277 --> 09:40.047
Oh, right. The reunion.
How was that?

09:40.081 --> 09:43.818
Almost everyone
was there except you.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.352
Oh...

09:46.754 --> 09:48.989
All right, yeah.
I don't know why that was.

09:49.023 --> 09:53.160
- I meant to come.
- Yeah. Sure.

09:53.194 --> 09:54.795
Don't worry.
You weren't the only teacher

09:54.829 --> 09:56.864
- that didn't show up.
- Okay, cool.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.100
An actual fact,
I was just a substitute teacher,

09:59.133 --> 10:01.135
not an actual teacher, so...

10:01.168 --> 10:03.237
- Yeah.
- I don't...

10:03.270 --> 10:05.339
This is me.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.974
- Nice seeing you.
- And you.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.642
I'm just staying
at the Metropole, so...

10:08.676 --> 10:09.743
Okay.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.412
You live here in...
in Maardam?

10:11.445 --> 10:12.947
Yeah, in Wassingen.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.281
It's a dreadful, dreadful place.

10:14.315 --> 10:15.749
But I probably have to win
the Academy Award

10:15.783 --> 10:17.318
to get some advantage, though.

10:17.351 --> 10:19.420
- Anyway...
- Well, listen, it's been nice seeing you.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.021
- Yeah, you, too.
- Bye.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.289
Bye.

10:32.466 --> 10:36.003
<i>Yeah, mainly because I didn't
know what else to do with myself,</i>

10:36.036 --> 10:40.007
<i>but, uh, I got in
for whatever reason.</i>

10:40.040 --> 10:43.878
<i>Well, to make documentaries,
which is what you're doing now, isn't it?</i>

10:55.456 --> 10:58.259
As far as I know,
he's never had a visitor.

10:58.292 --> 11:00.661
You're the first.

11:01.295 --> 11:02.796
What's this for?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.732
It's a... it's a hard drive,

11:04.765 --> 11:06.433
just to store the footage.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.303
Oh, yeah. Hm...

11:09.336 --> 11:10.905
It's all beyond me, any who.

11:15.176 --> 11:19.480
If you ask me,
Jacob Kall is a sick bastard.

11:19.514 --> 11:22.983
He's been in here ten years.
He'll end his days in here.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.719
He'll never be released.

11:29.390 --> 11:30.991
It's a battery.

11:32.326 --> 11:34.061
All right.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.996
Yeah, I'll be
outside that door.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.465
For your sake,
just so you know.

11:38.499 --> 11:41.869
He sometimes gets it
into this head to be violent.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.737
Yeah, yeah, I know.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.787
<i>We never met, you and I,</i>

11:59.820 --> 12:04.191
<i>but I was in the same class
as your daughter, Vera.</i>

12:04.225 --> 12:10.130
<i>You know, she never talked about you
or her life on the farm in Samaria.</i>

12:10.164 --> 12:14.134
<i>Always cycled home
when we went out drinking.</i>

12:14.168 --> 12:16.036
<i>We never really understood why.</i>

12:16.070 --> 12:17.938
<i>Well, she never
talked about it,</i>

12:17.972 --> 12:24.845
<i>but, um, she was so...
important to me.</i>

12:24.878 --> 12:27.948
<i>Well, not just to me,
to all of us.</i>

12:27.982 --> 12:31.553
<i>We had a reunion
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

12:31.586 --> 12:34.088
<i>Almost everyone was there.</i>

12:34.121 --> 12:38.392
<i>And it was really hard</i>

12:38.425 --> 12:40.528
<i>to avoid talking about her.</i>

12:41.996 --> 12:45.833
<i>Your daughter...
your only daughter, even.</i>

12:47.401 --> 12:51.138
<i>Could you tell me a bit about
your relationship with her?</i>

12:51.171 --> 12:52.973
<i>What was she like as a kid?</i>

12:53.007 --> 12:57.177
Was she... happy?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.219
At the reunion,
we talked a lot about

13:05.252 --> 13:07.388
how me missed having
a grave to visit,

13:07.421 --> 13:10.891
and how you're probably the only
person who knows where she's buried.

13:10.924 --> 13:14.562
That's if you even bothered
to bury her?

13:15.462 --> 13:18.299
Only God
knows where Vera is.

13:18.332 --> 13:21.536
Can I ask you
what you believe?

13:21.569 --> 13:24.471
I believe in God
and His will.

13:25.406 --> 13:27.074
Okay.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.177
I don't understand.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.580
Are you saying that Vera's death
was God's will?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.360
Even though you
never made a confession,

13:46.393 --> 13:49.330
and her body was never found,

13:49.363 --> 13:52.966
you were found guilty
and banged up for life.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.102
Do you maintain your innocence?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.209
Do you also claim to be
innocent of the accusations

14:02.242 --> 14:05.513
that you repeatedly
mistreated her as a child?

14:05.547 --> 14:08.616
Injuries that were documented
by the school nurse.

14:08.650 --> 14:11.018
The accident and emergency
department at Kaalbringen.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.320
Although neither Vera
nor your wife

14:13.354 --> 14:15.356
dared to speak out about it.

14:17.124 --> 14:21.462
Paula, I think you're
looking for some sort of guilt.

14:23.665 --> 14:27.334
The guilt laid on my shoulders
is of this world.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.371
But I'll tell you what,

14:30.404 --> 14:33.107
this world doesn't belong to me.

14:34.942 --> 14:38.479
What human being has the right
to kill another person?

14:40.047 --> 14:44.351
We are all just
simple instruments

14:44.385 --> 14:45.953
of a greater will.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.222
So you claim your innocence.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.890
So who did kill her?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.531
I sit here...

14:57.965 --> 15:01.001
most likely knocked up
for the rest of my life.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.303
And it was
probably meant to be.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.607
Sorry.

15:06.641 --> 15:08.909
It's meant to be.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.650
You see, I can get
so much more work done in here.

15:15.683 --> 15:19.453
There are people in here
who are willing to listen.

15:22.624 --> 15:27.695
So many lost souls
finally have a safe haven.

15:38.673 --> 15:41.676
The question is rather if you,

15:41.709 --> 15:44.512
Paula Polanski,
can understand this.

15:54.756 --> 15:57.559
I've been thinking about
where you must have buried her.

15:57.592 --> 16:00.194
I know the police did some
digging and searched with dogs.

16:00.227 --> 16:03.096
But down by the river,
there's this little piece of land.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.700
And I'm thinking maybe that's
where they should have looked?

16:06.501 --> 16:08.770
Or on the other side?

16:08.803 --> 16:11.472
In the forest? Yeah?

16:13.373 --> 16:15.610
I'm thinking
she must have been heavy.

16:15.643 --> 16:18.345
Dead body weighs a ton.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.581
Maybe you used your tractor?

16:19.614 --> 16:21.415
Though you
would've had to dug deep

16:21.448 --> 16:24.251
because you wouldn't want
a fox to dig her up.

16:27.488 --> 16:31.526
I've never quite grasped
why all you little people

16:31.559 --> 16:35.496
need to know everything.

16:35.530 --> 16:40.300
It's a human weakness
to be obsessed with the truth.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.202
As if it were up to us.

16:42.236 --> 16:46.674
As if the truth even existed.

17:14.368 --> 17:16.236
Already done?

17:16.270 --> 17:19.306
Yeah.
Didn't get very far.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.110
Right.
Let's get going, Jacob.

17:25.379 --> 17:27.447
I'll just take him
through the security gate.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.450
If you wait here,
I'll see you out after that.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.653
Thanks.

17:31.686 --> 17:34.221
That question you never asked.

17:35.557 --> 17:39.159
No, I didn't kill Vera.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.607
Yeah, I've just finished.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.242
Just... just on my way
to that meeting.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.846
Yeah, I know, I just wanna...

17:58.880 --> 18:01.649
I promise.
Just... I hear you.

18:01.683 --> 18:03.216
I promise I will.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.755
I'll probably be on
the 7:00 train anyways.

18:07.789 --> 18:10.558
No, don't be silly.
I'll just get a taxi.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.260
All right.
I love you.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.908
It was the first time we'd all
been together since then.

18:26.941 --> 18:29.376
So... but it...

18:29.409 --> 18:33.781
It was like everyone
needed to talk about Vera.

18:33.815 --> 18:36.684
Felt unfinished... somehow.

18:37.785 --> 18:41.689
I mean, really, we...

18:41.723 --> 18:44.826
Could have done
with a grave visit.

18:44.859 --> 18:46.694
It was a strange time.
It was...

18:46.728 --> 18:50.230
Life got too serious
much too soon, it felt.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.498
More so for you than for me.

18:51.532 --> 18:53.166
Yeah. Yeah.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.936
Sorry.
Uh, care for another?

18:54.969 --> 18:57.605
Um, yeah.
Yeah, thanks.

18:57.639 --> 18:59.507
- Not for me. Thank you.
- Oh.

19:00.642 --> 19:02.309
So...

19:02.644 --> 19:03.778
Hm?

19:03.811 --> 19:05.445
Apart from that,
what's happening?

19:05.479 --> 19:06.413
Shacked up?

19:06.446 --> 19:07.882
Married? No.

19:07.915 --> 19:11.418
I'm living with someone.
Clara, in Antwerp.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.220
She's... she's great.

19:13.588 --> 19:14.656
Ooh.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.860
Found these the other day.

19:18.893 --> 19:21.428
Oh, no.

19:22.797 --> 19:24.464
Ring any bells?

19:24.498 --> 19:26.400
Dear, oh, dear.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.836
Where have you got this?

19:28.870 --> 19:31.572
That's a long time ago.
I remember that.

19:33.007 --> 19:36.978
Oh, this is the, uh,
the graduation party at, uh, the, um...

19:37.011 --> 19:40.380
- Limburg Rooms.
- The Limburg Rooms, that's right.

19:40.414 --> 19:42.617
Goodness me. You were
walking around that night

19:42.650 --> 19:44.585
with your fantastic
old camera, as always.

19:44.619 --> 19:45.787
Yeah. Nikon.

19:45.820 --> 19:46.821
- All right.
- Oh, thank you.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.758
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

19:50.792 --> 19:53.393
- I used to develop my own pictures as well.
- Right.

19:53.427 --> 19:56.864
Was the worst kind of nerd,
even then.

19:56.898 --> 19:59.834
Here you are.
Schoolmaster Maertens.

19:59.867 --> 20:03.571
A tie? What on Earth
was I thinking?

20:03.604 --> 20:07.274
Here's me with, um,
with Sebastian.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.911
Oh, look at that.
You haven't changed, have you?

20:09.944 --> 20:11.713
Oh, thanks.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.584
And here she is,
Vera Kall.

20:20.922 --> 20:22.289
Oh.

20:41.809 --> 20:43.511
What was her father called?

20:43.544 --> 20:44.912
- Jacob.
- Jacob.

20:44.946 --> 20:48.683
- He's locked up in Bittinger.
- Yeah.

20:48.716 --> 20:50.685
Serving life sentence.

20:50.718 --> 20:52.887
Maintains his innocence.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.789
Actually, I met him yesterday.

20:54.822 --> 20:56.423
Met him?
That Jacob Kall?

20:56.456 --> 20:58.993
Yeah.
I... I interviewed him.

21:02.530 --> 21:04.464
I'm gonna make a film.

21:05.499 --> 21:09.436
Tell the story...
story of Vera.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.872
I think she's worth that much.

21:17.612 --> 21:19.547
I'd really like you
to be in it.

21:31.692 --> 21:34.061
- Henry...
- I was a substitute teacher

21:34.095 --> 21:35.830
for one term, all right?
I have to get my train.

21:35.863 --> 21:37.865
But you were an important person
to all of us.

21:37.899 --> 21:40.367
And the film
is not gonna be about you.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.969
I've already spoken
to Beatrice Motte,

21:42.003 --> 21:43.504
I'm gonna speak to
Commissioner Keller,

21:43.538 --> 21:45.506
and I'll speak to Jacob Kall
again if I have to.

21:45.540 --> 21:48.408
Although, I'd... I'd...
I'd rather not.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.878
A girl in your class
was murdered.

21:50.912 --> 21:52.680
I'm really surprised
you don't seem to care.

21:52.713 --> 21:54.048
I don't wanna be in your film.
I'm sorry.

21:54.081 --> 21:55.583
What, because you think
it's a bad idea?

21:58.586 --> 22:00.621
It will open up
a lot of old wounds,

22:00.655 --> 22:02.790
and it will upset
a lot of people.

22:02.824 --> 22:04.025
I do believe that.

22:04.058 --> 22:06.093
I think it's better
to just let things lie.

22:06.127 --> 22:08.129
Okay. I know that.

22:08.162 --> 22:09.764
- Good.
- But...

22:11.799 --> 22:13.734
I am gonna make this film.

22:15.670 --> 22:18.105
You'll have to do it without me.
I'm sorry.

24:43.818 --> 24:45.987
Yes, I rented out
the upper floor

24:46.020 --> 24:47.655
because it was rather difficult

24:47.688 --> 24:51.525
managing my own finances
after my husband passed away.

24:51.559 --> 24:53.060
God bless him.

24:53.094 --> 24:55.196
He was useless in most ways,

24:55.229 --> 24:57.531
but there were certain things

24:57.565 --> 24:59.233
I'd still come to depend
on him for.

24:59.266 --> 25:01.535
Sorry.

25:03.871 --> 25:09.310
Um... I'm gonna take this,
actually. Sorry.

25:09.343 --> 25:10.945
- Hello.
- <i>Paula.</i>

25:10.978 --> 25:12.580
Hi. It's... it's Henry Maertens.

25:12.613 --> 25:13.581
Am I calling at a bad time?

25:13.614 --> 25:15.149
No, no, no, no.
Not at all.

25:15.182 --> 25:17.018
<i>Great. I... I was thinking
maybe I'll take</i>

25:17.051 --> 25:18.652
a trip to Kaalbringen
after all.

25:18.686 --> 25:20.321
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yes, well, I was thinking

25:20.354 --> 25:21.756
about what you said.

25:21.789 --> 25:24.992
And, uh, maybe I could
be of some help.

25:25.026 --> 25:26.694
Great.

25:26.727 --> 25:28.662
Is the Hotel Continental
still there, do you know?

25:28.696 --> 25:34.568
Uh... uh, I think so, but, um,
you could stay with me.

25:34.602 --> 25:37.271
I've, I've borrowed my parents'
summerhouse by the river.

25:37.304 --> 25:39.206
No, no, I don't... I, um...

25:39.240 --> 25:40.641
<i>There's plenty of space.</i>

25:40.674 --> 25:42.343
And you can tell Clara
that I'm gay,

25:42.376 --> 25:44.812
so... so no problem there.

25:44.845 --> 25:47.681
- Um...
- <i>Let's just leave it at that.</i>

25:47.715 --> 25:49.316
Let me find The Continental,
see if they have a room.

25:49.350 --> 25:51.252
Ah, okay, I'm just about
to drive through a tunnel.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.155
Pau...

25:56.724 --> 25:58.993
Sorry.

25:59.026 --> 26:01.729
Okay.
Uh, where were we?

26:01.762 --> 26:08.135
Um, were there lots of, uh,
visitors or friends dropping in?

26:08.169 --> 26:11.272
<i>Well, I don't know.
I... I can't really remember.</i>

26:11.305 --> 26:13.808
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>

26:28.389 --> 26:31.292
<i>Wow. It's gotta be
ten years since then.</i>

26:31.325 --> 26:33.794
- <i>Almost exactly.</i>
- <i>An actual fact,</i>

26:33.828 --> 26:36.263
<i>I was just a substitute
teacher, not an actual teacher.</i>

26:36.297 --> 26:38.232
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

26:45.172 --> 26:48.209
Hi. I'm looking for Mr. Kruggel.

26:48.242 --> 26:50.344
I'm Henry Maertens,
the substitute teacher.

26:50.377 --> 26:51.846
Oh. I'm Susanne.

26:51.879 --> 26:53.414
Come in.
Dad's waiting for you.

26:53.447 --> 26:54.648
Thanks.

26:56.150 --> 26:58.385
Can't imagine
he'll ever improve.

26:58.419 --> 27:00.855
Always late.
Always.

27:00.888 --> 27:06.293
Uh, Emil Bachmann.
An idiot.

27:09.430 --> 27:11.832
Okay. Uh, Paula Polanski.

27:11.866 --> 27:14.902
She did very well in her,
uh, in her standard test.

27:14.935 --> 27:17.438
- Paula Polanski?
- I don't know, I...

27:17.471 --> 27:19.440
I haven't actually met
any of the students yet.

27:19.473 --> 27:24.311
Ah, the mousey one. Yes.

27:30.384 --> 27:32.186
We're nearly finished.
I promise.

27:32.219 --> 27:35.923
Um, Niels Buhltoft?

27:35.956 --> 27:38.859
Uh, neither fish nor fowl.

27:38.893 --> 27:42.029
Uh, unless he does something
out of the ordinary

27:42.062 --> 27:46.133
in his special assignment
on literature.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.836
Um, can I offer you
a coffee or something?

27:50.037 --> 27:53.207
Um... no, do you know what?
I think I'm good.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.709
- I think I should probably go.
- Okay.

27:55.743 --> 27:57.845
Thanks so much for your help.
I, uh, I have an appointment

27:57.878 --> 28:00.347
with the, uh, the headmaster
in 20 minutes. So...

28:29.544 --> 28:31.278
- <i>Hey.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

28:31.312 --> 28:34.014
- You all right?
- Yeah, good. Welcome.

28:34.048 --> 28:35.115
Thank you.

28:36.450 --> 28:39.353
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, yeah, you too.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.491
I... I was surprised
when you called

28:44.526 --> 28:47.328
because when we met in Maardam,
you sounded...

28:47.361 --> 28:49.063
- Yeah.
- Very negative.

28:49.096 --> 28:50.831
Yeah, sorry, about that.

28:52.534 --> 28:55.102
Yeah, I managed to get
a couple of days free.

28:55.135 --> 28:57.838
Clara's, uh,
she'd step into work this week.

28:57.871 --> 29:01.041
She's a doctor, yup.
Cardiologist.

29:09.850 --> 29:12.419
Did... did I tell you
about Vera's mother?

29:12.453 --> 29:14.154
No.

29:14.188 --> 29:17.291
Well, she... she died
a couple of months ago.

29:17.324 --> 29:18.792
Oh.

29:18.826 --> 29:22.329
When Vera's father
was convicted, she left.

29:22.363 --> 29:26.934
She just walked out
of that house, never went back.

29:26.967 --> 29:29.470
Moved in with
her sister, apparently.

29:30.204 --> 29:31.438
Mm...

29:42.983 --> 29:45.953
- Samaria.
- What?

29:45.986 --> 29:49.023
It's the name of the farm
where Vera grew up.

29:49.056 --> 29:50.558
Ah, yeah.

29:50.592 --> 29:53.160
Sounds so beautiful.

29:53.193 --> 29:55.029
Samaria? Yeah.

29:56.430 --> 29:58.999
Yeah, I suppose it does.

29:59.033 --> 30:03.304
Like something out of
a fairytale... almost.

30:04.872 --> 30:09.310
- A little like Vera herself.
- Hm, yeah, maybe.

30:34.034 --> 30:35.503
Bit hungover today, guys?

30:36.671 --> 30:38.640
No pleasure without pain,
isn't it?

30:38.673 --> 30:40.074
All right?

30:40.107 --> 30:41.975
You don't know
what's happened, do you?

30:42.009 --> 30:43.310
What?

30:43.344 --> 30:47.414
Vera. Vera Kall.
She never came home last night.

30:47.448 --> 30:51.218
- Oh.
- Her mother report her missing to the police.

30:52.986 --> 30:54.622
Well, I'm sure she's fine.
I'm sure she probably

30:54.656 --> 30:57.024
just stayed over
with a friend or something.

30:58.058 --> 31:00.427
Okay? She'll be fine.

31:05.165 --> 31:07.067
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:07.101 --> 31:08.435
Can I get a double espresso,
please?

31:08.469 --> 31:10.505
Of course. Coming up.

31:14.308 --> 31:17.177
<i>This is not only about
Vera and her family,</i>

31:17.211 --> 31:21.215
it is about all of us
at City College.

31:21.248 --> 31:23.484
So I'd like to remind you
that all information,

31:23.518 --> 31:28.489
anything you saw at the Limburg
Rooms could be vitally important.

31:29.591 --> 31:31.125
You may think some item
of information

31:31.158 --> 31:33.927
is of no use at all,
but it could prove to be

31:33.961 --> 31:36.363
exactly that little
missing piece of the puzzle,

31:36.397 --> 31:39.567
that will bring clarity to the circumstances
surrounding Vera's disappearance.

31:39.601 --> 31:43.137
So don't hesitate.

31:44.506 --> 31:46.641
If for some reason
you don't want to talk

31:46.674 --> 31:50.645
to the police directly,
we are here.

31:50.678 --> 31:53.515
You can turn
to any member of staff.

31:54.381 --> 31:57.251
Or to me, of course.

32:16.538 --> 32:17.705
Wow.

32:20.274 --> 32:21.576
It's great.

32:21.609 --> 32:24.712
Yeah.
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

32:26.013 --> 32:28.015
So I've, um,
I've given you the room

32:28.048 --> 32:30.984
- that overlooks the river.
- Okay. Sounds very flash.

32:31.018 --> 32:33.588
And I've, uh, I've moved myself
into the box room.

32:33.621 --> 32:35.757
Ah.

32:35.790 --> 32:37.525
So how long can you stay?

32:37.559 --> 32:39.493
Couple of days, if not, more.

32:40.127 --> 32:41.663
Cool.

33:13.126 --> 33:15.663
How are you planning on
making this film?

33:15.697 --> 33:17.799
Well, when you're
making a documentary,

33:17.832 --> 33:19.767
you don't really know
where it's gonna end,

33:19.801 --> 33:24.271
but I'm trying to meet everyone
who knew her, interview them,

33:24.304 --> 33:27.374
and see if I can build up
a picture of her.

33:27.407 --> 33:29.409
With all the plans
to visit the grave,

33:29.443 --> 33:31.245
or whatever it is
we're calling it?

33:31.278 --> 33:32.814
Yeah, that might
have been part of my plan,

33:32.847 --> 33:34.481
but having met Jacob Kall,

33:34.516 --> 33:36.651
I'd say that's a little
too much to hope for.

33:37.752 --> 33:40.053
Going for a new angle?

33:40.087 --> 33:42.524
Um, remains to be seen.

33:42.557 --> 33:47.695
You know, she...
she clearly made an impression.

33:47.729 --> 33:50.364
Everybody has
their own picture of Vera.

33:50.397 --> 33:54.101
I know I do, anyway.
Maybe you do as well.

33:54.134 --> 33:56.169
Uh, yeah, as I recall her,
she was a very good student.

33:56.203 --> 33:59.541
I want to understand,
partially just who she was,

33:59.574 --> 34:02.744
but also what it does to us when
someone just disappears out of our...

34:02.777 --> 34:07.515
You know, how we just carry on
living as if nothing has happened.

34:07.549 --> 34:09.449
And is that what we really do?

34:09.483 --> 34:11.418
I suppose not.

34:12.620 --> 34:13.821
Do you want coffee?

34:13.855 --> 34:17.257
Please. Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.

34:17.291 --> 34:20.093
At the same time, there is some
strange stuff in this story.

34:20.127 --> 34:23.831
For instance, why did it take the
police so long to arrest her father?

34:23.865 --> 34:26.133
And what was her mother's role
in all of this?

34:26.166 --> 34:28.803
Is she completely exonerated?

34:28.836 --> 34:33.340
Or what if Jacob Kall is telling
the truth and he's innocent?

34:35.208 --> 34:36.778
Are you serious?

34:38.580 --> 34:40.247
No, no, no, he's a monster,

34:40.280 --> 34:42.884
I mean, you just have to
keep the door open

34:42.917 --> 34:45.118
- when it's a work in progress.
- Of course.

34:45.152 --> 34:46.453
I'm guessing
you know how to do that.

34:46.486 --> 34:48.590
I hope so.

34:59.366 --> 35:00.735
It was just like
in that film

35:00.768 --> 35:02.402
with, um, Bill Murray.

35:02.436 --> 35:04.471
What's it called?
Uh, <i>Groundhog Day.</i>

35:04.505 --> 35:09.577
<i>I rented a room from an old
widow, uh, Mrs. Kuntze.</i>

35:14.549 --> 35:17.685
<i>Same routine, every morning.</i>

35:17.719 --> 35:19.887
<i>It was me and this guy,
Kellerman,</i>

35:19.921 --> 35:22.189
<i>an optician's assistant.
Aged...</i>

35:22.222 --> 35:25.526
- Morning, Kellerman.
- <i>...somewhere between 30 and 60.</i>

35:25.560 --> 35:31.599
<i>We shared a bathroom with, uh, Tomas, Mrs.
Kuntze's old cat.</i>

35:32.466 --> 35:33.735
I don't think he ever said

35:33.768 --> 35:35.503
one word to me
while I was there.

35:35.536 --> 35:37.839
Who? The cat or Kellerman?

35:37.872 --> 35:39.473
Very good.

35:47.515 --> 35:48.716
No, thanks.

35:48.750 --> 35:52.252
I, um... packed those in
a long time ago.

35:54.287 --> 35:59.493
So tell me about...
uh, about Clara.

36:00.795 --> 36:02.496
Yeah, what...
what do you wanna know?

36:02.530 --> 36:04.297
- You live in Antwerp.
- Mm-hm.

36:04.331 --> 36:07.502
- She's a... a doctor.
- Doctor. Yeah.

36:07.535 --> 36:09.671
- You're a copywriter.
- Mm-hm.

36:09.704 --> 36:12.205
What else? Any, any kids?

36:12.239 --> 36:14.174
No. No.

36:15.308 --> 36:16.644
We, um...

36:18.846 --> 36:20.748
Didn't, uh...

36:22.550 --> 36:24.619
Hasn't really worked out.

36:24.652 --> 36:26.688
That kinda thing.

36:26.721 --> 36:31.324
If, um... Yeah.

36:59.352 --> 37:00.922
Was... was it something I said?

37:00.955 --> 37:03.691
Oh, no. Don't be silly.
No, um, things have been

37:03.725 --> 37:07.294
very hard on the home front
of late but...

37:09.362 --> 37:13.501
- You wanna talk about it?
- There's not a lot to say.

37:13.534 --> 37:15.302
Clara and I always
intended to have children,

37:15.335 --> 37:18.039
but I've later backed away from
it, I don't know why.

37:18.072 --> 37:21.042
So on Tuesday, she decided
she'd waited long enough.

37:21.075 --> 37:23.678
She took the car and the dog
and went to her sister's house.

37:23.711 --> 37:25.412
Cancelled the reservation
for the house

37:25.445 --> 37:26.948
that we're about to rent
in the south of France,

37:26.981 --> 37:29.984
- and doesn't answer my calls.
- So that's why you came.

37:30.017 --> 37:31.485
No.

37:33.888 --> 37:35.388
How about you?
Anyone?

37:35.422 --> 37:38.659
Um... Oh...

37:40.327 --> 37:44.498
I... I don't know,
I've, um...

37:44.532 --> 37:46.868
- Taking some time out from that sorta thing.
- Right.

37:46.901 --> 37:51.038
I'm not so good at the whole
relationship, uh, thing, yeah.

37:52.874 --> 37:55.977
- Thank you.
- She just, um...

37:56.010 --> 37:58.579
She started seeing
somebody else.

37:58.613 --> 38:02.517
And everything just
ran into the sand.

38:02.550 --> 38:04.417
I don't know.

38:07.420 --> 38:09.356
Maybe it s just as well.

38:09.991 --> 38:11.324
Yeah.

38:17.131 --> 38:20.635
So, uh, what do you
remember about us?

38:22.103 --> 38:24.371
Us, your students...

38:24.404 --> 38:26.473
- Oh.
- In class 3B at City College?

38:28.810 --> 38:30.077
<i>I liked being your teacher.</i>

38:30.111 --> 38:31.646
<i>I liked it.</i>

38:34.749 --> 38:36.584
<i>Not everyone, of course.</i>

38:36.617 --> 38:39.486
<i>You know, some I like less,
like, a lot less.</i>

38:41.622 --> 38:45.092
<i>But, you know, others more.</i>

38:50.164 --> 38:53.935
<i>It felt strange at times being
in a position of authority</i>

38:53.968 --> 38:56.804
<i>when I was only
a few years older than you.</i>

38:59.073 --> 39:01.008
Don't forget
tomorrow's the deadline

39:01.042 --> 39:02.510
for handing in
your poetry analysis.

39:02.543 --> 39:03.978
Do not forget, please.

39:04.011 --> 39:05.613
<i>But then that's how it was.</i>

39:05.646 --> 39:08.015
<i>I was your teacher
and you were my student.</i>

39:08.049 --> 39:09.416
Good.

39:21.662 --> 39:23.898
<i>Every day, I'd pack up,</i>

39:23.931 --> 39:27.400
<i>and then home again to...
to Mrs. Kuntze.</i>

39:29.503 --> 39:32.506
<i>And we lived in a beautiful
neighborhood called the Pampa...</i>

39:32.540 --> 39:33.741
<i>well, the Pampas, you know.</i>

39:33.774 --> 39:35.943
- Hi. How are you?
- Nothing for you.

39:35.977 --> 39:37.444
Oh. Every time.

39:37.477 --> 39:39.412
<i>I came and went
as I pleased, really.</i>

39:39.446 --> 39:41.883
- What have you been doing today?
- Today was good.

39:41.916 --> 39:44.185
Today, uh, I have 30 students
doing an essay

39:44.218 --> 39:45.887
- on narrative structure.
- Oh, dear.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.454
- Yes.
- Narrative...

39:47.487 --> 39:49.190
<i>And Mrs. Kuntze,
she was very kind.</i>

39:49.223 --> 39:51.559
<i>As was her cat, Tomas.</i>

39:54.695 --> 39:58.799
<i>And then every night
I'd sit up, correct tests,</i>

39:58.833 --> 40:03.905
<i>prepare my work,
eventually falling asleep,</i>

40:03.938 --> 40:06.941
<i>and waking again
to another exciting day.</i>

41:13.140 --> 41:15.643
<i>When we got
changed after gym class,</i>

41:15.676 --> 41:17.645
<i>I noticed she had
a big bruise on her arm.</i>

41:17.678 --> 41:19.914
<i>She said she'd hurt herself
on some gym equipment.</i>

41:19.947 --> 41:23.050
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- <i>I didn't know how things were for her at home.</i>

41:23.084 --> 41:25.686
- <i>She never opened up about it.</i>
- <i>She didn't with anyone.</i>

41:25.720 --> 41:27.955
<i>I mean, she could have
moved in with me!</i>

41:30.624 --> 41:32.126
<i>I should have done something.</i>

41:32.159 --> 41:34.061
<i>It was before it was too late.</i>

41:34.095 --> 41:36.163
<i>That... that was...</i>

41:36.197 --> 41:40.735
<i>I don't think there's anything any
of us could have done, you know?</i>

41:46.107 --> 41:49.143
<i>I remember that party
as if it were yesterday,</i>

41:50.211 --> 41:52.046
<i>the one at the Limburg Rooms.</i>

41:53.047 --> 41:54.281
<i>When are you thinking?</i>

41:56.584 --> 41:58.819
<i>It was the last time
I spoke to her,</i>

41:58.853 --> 42:00.321
<i>in the girls' loo.</i>

42:00.354 --> 42:02.823
<i>What time was that?</i>

42:02.857 --> 42:05.793
<i>Eleven? Half past.</i>

42:05.826 --> 42:07.695
<i>And anything else?</i>

42:09.897 --> 42:11.999
<i>I don't know.</i>

42:12.033 --> 42:14.802
<i>It's just...
the whole thing's so sad.</i>

42:14.835 --> 42:17.271
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>She was so happy!</i>

42:17.304 --> 42:18.739
<i>Happy?</i>

42:18.773 --> 42:20.074
<i>She wasn't usually the sort</i>

42:20.107 --> 42:23.044
- <i>to be cheerful exactly.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

42:23.077 --> 42:26.680
<i>It was as if something
good had happened in her life.</i>

42:30.885 --> 42:33.187
Anyway, that's all I got
because her kid

42:33.220 --> 42:36.023
hit his head and started
screaming and, you know.

42:36.057 --> 42:38.659
Great not to have kids.

42:40.861 --> 42:44.732
- Sorry, sorry.
- I'm gonna go for a dip.

42:44.765 --> 42:48.035
- I think I need to cool down a bit.
- Okay.

42:48.069 --> 42:50.738
Hey, uh, you know,
Commissioner Keller

42:50.771 --> 42:53.207
is coming in an hour,
if you wanna join.

42:53.240 --> 42:56.911
Um... maybe I could
borrow the car?

42:58.145 --> 42:59.246
- Okay.
- Great!

42:59.280 --> 43:02.383
Um, but, uh,
my dad will kill you

43:02.416 --> 43:04.018
if anything happens to that car,
you know.

43:04.051 --> 43:06.720
No, no, no, I'm...
I'm serious, not a scratch.

43:35.783 --> 43:37.718
<i>Nah, school's
closed, it's summer.</i>

43:37.751 --> 43:41.122
I know that. I know.
I, um, I used to work here.

43:41.155 --> 43:43.724
I was just wondering if I could
have a quick look around.

43:45.392 --> 43:47.161
Let me know when you leave.

43:47.194 --> 43:48.629
Thank you.

44:28.302 --> 44:29.770
Yeah.

44:32.306 --> 44:33.374
Can I come in?

44:33.407 --> 44:35.342
Of course, you can, yeah.

44:38.045 --> 44:39.847
Do with your help.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.916
All right. Okay.

44:47.755 --> 44:49.356
What can I help with?

44:49.390 --> 44:52.126
I can't make up my mind
which one to choose?

44:52.527 --> 44:54.695
Okay.

44:55.095 --> 44:56.297
Ah...

44:57.965 --> 45:00.334
<i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>
and <i>Madame Bovary.</i>

45:00.367 --> 45:02.736
Well, you've chosen
two entirely different texts,

45:02.770 --> 45:04.905
both classics.

45:04.939 --> 45:09.376
Um, this is one of the world's
best known love stories.

45:11.312 --> 45:13.347
Really, I'd like
to write about both,

45:13.380 --> 45:16.750
but that might seem
a bit overambitious.

45:16.784 --> 45:18.152
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

45:18.185 --> 45:21.422
Um, Céline, on the other hand...

45:25.426 --> 45:30.130
Uh, well, this is very dark.

45:31.465 --> 45:34.401
It's all about the First World
War, a lot of anguish.

45:34.435 --> 45:37.104
He was almost obsessed by death,
wasn't he?

45:37.137 --> 45:40.107
Oh, that's a little bit
of an understatement, but, yeah.

45:43.911 --> 45:47.815
I don't know.
I suppose if one...

45:47.848 --> 45:50.284
if one were to say that Céline
is the true pessimist,

45:50.317 --> 45:53.254
then you could also say that
Flaubert is his complete opposite.

45:53.287 --> 45:56.257
If I were you,
I'd go for the Flaubert.

45:56.290 --> 45:59.260
- Hmm.
- Because life is gloomy enough even without Céline in it.

45:59.293 --> 46:03.397
And a little bit of love,
never did anybody any harm, so...

46:04.932 --> 46:07.935
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

46:11.506 --> 46:13.575
Then I know.

46:13.608 --> 46:15.142
You've decided?

46:15.175 --> 46:16.511
Yeah.

46:17.411 --> 46:19.046
This one, of course.

46:24.451 --> 46:25.919
Thanks.

46:31.392 --> 46:33.027
<i>In the beginning
she was just missing,</i>

46:33.060 --> 46:34.895
<i>so we waited for her to return,</i>

46:34.928 --> 46:37.464
but she never did, in the end.

46:37.498 --> 46:40.134
So we dredged the river,

46:40.167 --> 46:45.105
searched her cycle routes
with dogs, formed human chains.

46:45.139 --> 46:48.142
I think we questioned
close to 150 people.

46:48.175 --> 46:51.145
Wow. You had a few
other suspects, didn't you?

46:51.178 --> 46:52.846
Before you detained
Jacob Kall?

46:52.880 --> 46:55.916
Well, there was a known rapist

46:55.949 --> 46:58.218
who appears to have
been in the area.

46:58.252 --> 46:59.621
An old jailbird
who lived nearby.

46:59.654 --> 47:02.256
And her classmate,
Emil Bachmann.

47:03.457 --> 47:05.359
That's what it said
in the paper.

47:05.392 --> 47:08.028
He was in custody
for a while, wasn't he?

47:08.062 --> 47:12.966
Arrested.
Dr. No let him go.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.105
Oh, you mean, um...
Neyman, the prosecutor?

47:18.138 --> 47:20.274
Neyman, yeah.

47:20.307 --> 47:23.077
Who actually had
a point for once.

47:24.378 --> 47:28.015
Mm, could I have
some more coffee?

47:28.048 --> 47:32.486
Three weeks later,
you arrested Jacob Kall.

47:32.520 --> 47:35.657
Talk about dragging your feet.

47:35.690 --> 47:39.993
You'd been informed that
he'd mistreated Vera for years.

47:40.027 --> 47:41.995
That was the only thing
that annoys me.

47:42.029 --> 47:45.432
Yeah, but three weeks?

47:45.466 --> 47:48.168
Is that what you call
good police work?

47:50.938 --> 47:56.477
Sometimes that's just how it is.

47:56.511 --> 47:59.213
But the worst of it was
that it gave him plenty of time

47:59.246 --> 48:00.981
to cover his tracks.

48:01.014 --> 48:02.550
And although he'd scrubbed
the place down,

48:02.584 --> 48:05.018
we quickly found
Vera's blood in the kitchen.

48:05.052 --> 48:10.290
And eventually we found Vera's dress
in her wardrobe, also covered in blood.

48:10.324 --> 48:13.661
We turned the house upside down.

48:13.695 --> 48:16.263
We dug up half the neighborhood.

48:16.296 --> 48:18.232
You didn't find anything?

48:18.265 --> 48:21.603
We didn't even
find her bicycle.

48:21.636 --> 48:26.641
But, as I said,
he had a fair amount of time.

48:28.008 --> 48:31.245
It still riles me.

48:31.278 --> 48:33.313
What about
Vera's mother, Monica?

48:33.347 --> 48:34.616
What was her role
in all of this?

48:34.649 --> 48:36.250
Who knows.
We didn't manage to get

48:36.283 --> 48:37.719
one sensible word out of her.

48:37.752 --> 48:39.286
Do you think she was afraid?

48:41.221 --> 48:44.124
I don't think Vera Kall
was the only one

48:44.158 --> 48:49.029
to come face-to-face
with Jacob Kall's lunacy.

48:49.697 --> 48:51.498
Let's put it that way.

48:55.335 --> 48:56.970
Isn't it a little bit weird

48:57.004 --> 48:59.139
to sentence someone
for a murder without a corpse?

48:59.173 --> 49:01.509
But not unique.
And in this case there were,

49:01.543 --> 49:05.379
uh, number of indicators
and technical evidence.

49:05.412 --> 49:10.150
And there was proof that she
had been maltreated at home.

49:10.184 --> 49:12.286
- And now he's banged up for life.
- Yes.

49:12.319 --> 49:14.054
Despite never having
confessed to the crime.

49:14.087 --> 49:18.459
Jacob Kall is not
the confessing type.

49:34.609 --> 49:37.444
So just turning
the clock back a little bit.

49:37.478 --> 49:42.282
You interviewed some witnesses aside
from the people at the Limburg Rooms.

49:42.316 --> 49:47.287
Yes, we had people who saw
her cycling away from the party.

49:47.321 --> 49:50.658
Some claimed she cycled off in
the wrong direction, towards town.

49:50.692 --> 49:53.360
Others saw her
around the industrial estate.

49:53.393 --> 49:56.698
But everything points to having
cycled home at about...

49:56.731 --> 50:01.769
about 11:30, in which case she would've
got home about 45 minutes later.

50:01.803 --> 50:04.639
But that's not all,
though, right?

50:05.807 --> 50:07.609
What are you suggesting?

50:09.309 --> 50:12.246
Emil Bachmann left the
Limburg Rooms just before Vera.

50:12.279 --> 50:13.815
I know that for sure.

50:13.848 --> 50:16.083
But he didn't get home until
half past 4:00 in the morning,

50:16.116 --> 50:17.451
that's what
the newspaper guy said.

50:17.484 --> 50:19.486
It's in the <i>Morning Post.</i>

50:19.521 --> 50:21.656
- I have the cutting right here.
- But one thing I can tell you,

50:21.689 --> 50:24.659
we had witnesses who saw
Bachmann at the bus station

50:24.692 --> 50:27.629
at the exact same time
as he was allegedly

50:27.662 --> 50:30.665
trying to break into a car
on the other side of town.

50:32.132 --> 50:35.135
And there were people
who could confidently say

50:35.168 --> 50:38.305
that they saw Vera Kall
cycling home at 1:00

50:38.338 --> 50:40.675
and 2:00 and 3:00
in the morning.

50:40.708 --> 50:43.377
Even a drunk who says
he saw her catch

50:43.410 --> 50:49.216
the first train to Altmaar
at 6:15, wearing angel wings.

50:49.249 --> 50:54.856
If you take
every tip-off seriously,

50:54.889 --> 50:57.859
you completely lose the plot.

50:57.892 --> 51:02.697
That's just how it is.

51:02.730 --> 51:05.567
And I think
I'm going to call it a day.

51:05.600 --> 51:09.202
Okay. Well, thanks
for coming all this way.

51:09.236 --> 51:11.471
Well, hello there.

51:11.506 --> 51:14.876
And who might you be
lurking in the shadows?

51:14.909 --> 51:18.211
I'm Henry Maertens.
I was one of the teachers at City College.

51:18.245 --> 51:21.616
Are you also involved
in this film spectacle?

51:21.649 --> 51:24.519
Well, not exactly.
I'm probably a bit like you, um,

51:24.552 --> 51:26.186
I'm a bit of
an interview victim, I think.

51:26.219 --> 51:28.723
Oh, whatever. I'm off.

51:28.756 --> 51:30.390
Well, nice to meet you.

51:31.258 --> 51:33.628
Uh, good luck.

51:45.807 --> 51:47.875
Maybe you could
cut that last bit.

51:47.909 --> 51:49.711
Yeah, I'll let you see
the final edit

51:49.744 --> 51:52.112
before I lock it down,
like I promised.

51:54.749 --> 51:59.353
- Um, one final question.
- Yeah?

51:59.386 --> 52:00.788
Do you know if Vera
had a boyfriend?

52:00.822 --> 52:05.492
Well, there was no indication,
no one came forward.

52:05.526 --> 52:07.194
Her mobile was gone,

52:07.227 --> 52:10.230
and anyway she had
one of those top-up cards.

52:10.263 --> 52:15.335
There was no diary or anything.
No computer of her own.

52:15.369 --> 52:16.904
But I bet there was
a bloke somewhere.

52:16.938 --> 52:19.607
She was an attractive looking
girl to say the least.

52:19.641 --> 52:25.613
And her father wasn't the kind to
encourage those kinds of liaisons.

52:25.647 --> 52:27.949
- So there's your motive.
- But why would he...

52:27.982 --> 52:31.719
Jacob Kall is a true bastard.

52:32.987 --> 52:34.789
Let him rot.

53:03.283 --> 53:05.553
Paula, how about lunch
in town on me?

53:05.586 --> 53:07.855
Well, I was all set up
to interview you.

53:07.889 --> 53:09.757
There's no hurry for that,
is there?

53:09.791 --> 53:11.826
No, not as far as I'm concerned.

53:11.859 --> 53:13.995
- Good.
- Uh, good.

53:14.028 --> 53:16.363
Okay, let me just, um,
uh, pack everything up.

53:16.396 --> 53:17.565
Yeah.

53:52.499 --> 53:54.434
- Is she not answering?
- No.

54:01.441 --> 54:04.311
What's she like, Claire,
is she attractive?

54:04.344 --> 54:07.014
I'll show you
a picture if you like.

54:08.683 --> 54:10.852
Look, you're analog.

54:11.686 --> 54:13.521
I like that.

54:16.423 --> 54:17.959
Hmm.

54:17.992 --> 54:19.426
Thanks.

54:22.329 --> 54:23.564
Do you love her?

54:28.468 --> 54:30.004
Right now it feels...

54:33.641 --> 54:36.010
Feels a bit like I'm about to lose
her, or something.

54:37.812 --> 54:39.412
Anyway.

54:39.446 --> 54:42.315
Emil Bachmann
isn't answering either.

54:42.349 --> 54:44.652
I've emailed him and called him
a number of times,

54:44.685 --> 54:47.420
but it's just...
He's just declining my calls.

54:47.454 --> 54:49.957
It's hardly
surprising, isn't it?

54:49.991 --> 54:52.527
If you've already emailed him,
then he knows what it's about.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.695
He won't want to be reminded,
will he?

54:54.729 --> 54:57.632
And he was never
actually charged so...

54:59.567 --> 55:03.403
He was arrested for assault
in town the previous year.

55:03.436 --> 55:07.108
Possession of drugs
and bicycle theft.

55:07.141 --> 55:10.343
It was before your time, but everyone
knew he could be fucking aggressive.

55:10.377 --> 55:13.114
Is this some kind of
new theory of yours,

55:13.147 --> 55:15.683
some sort of
alternative perpetrate?

55:18.152 --> 55:21.923
Emil left the party
at 11:00, wasted,

55:21.956 --> 55:24.592
according to a number
of witnesses including myself.

55:24.625 --> 55:29.462
And then wasn't seen again until half 4:00
in the morning by that paper delivery guy.

55:29.496 --> 55:33.734
I want to talk to him about what he
was doing during those missing hours.

55:33.768 --> 55:35.970
If Emil did steal the car
on the other side of town,

55:36.003 --> 55:38.673
I'm pretty sure he won't
want to discuss it with you.

55:40.675 --> 55:42.877
<i>Honorable guests,</i>

55:42.910 --> 55:48.015
respected colleagues,
and of course students,

55:48.049 --> 55:51.118
or maybe I should say
cherished students.

55:51.152 --> 55:54.121
<i>It must have been
just after 10:00.</i>

55:54.155 --> 55:57.592
<i>Vasterman had been boring on
for what felt like hours.</i>

55:57.625 --> 56:01.596
<i>And Emil was
pretty drunk by then.</i>

56:01.629 --> 56:05.465
Well, maybe not
quite as glittering

56:05.498 --> 56:06.701
as it should have been.

56:07.835 --> 56:09.436
At some points

56:09.469 --> 56:12.607
there was quite a lot
of tarnish going on.

56:12.640 --> 56:14.542
<i>However on the whole...</i>

56:14.575 --> 56:16.611
You know, I never got
the stain out of that dress.

56:16.644 --> 56:19.080
<i>...was one
of the great success...</i>

56:19.113 --> 56:22.683
I was sitting just behind
this pillar here, I remember.

56:22.717 --> 56:24.752
Couldn't see a damn thing.

56:24.785 --> 56:27.788
<i>Congratulations to one and...</i>

56:30.958 --> 56:32.860
Mate, just stop making
that fucking noise, yeah.

56:32.894 --> 56:34.662
This isn't... No, seriously,
you're pissing me off.

56:34.695 --> 56:36.063
- Take it easy.
- Don't touch me, mate.

56:36.097 --> 56:37.932
- I just fucking said don't touch me!
- Hey!

56:39.233 --> 56:43.170
Hey, come back inside.
Don't be a dick.

56:43.204 --> 56:45.405
Fucking done, innit?

56:48.643 --> 56:50.945
Emil, where are you going?

56:50.978 --> 56:54.782
I don't have any notion of
where Emil Bachmann was that night,

56:54.815 --> 56:57.184
but I'm guessing
he must have left before me.

57:03.557 --> 57:05.526
I remember you said
you were going home

57:05.559 --> 57:07.929
<i>and you laughed
and said we should go easy</i>

57:07.962 --> 57:10.231
<i>or something grown up,
like that.</i>

57:10.264 --> 57:12.533
- Good night.
- Don't go, Henry. Don't leave me.

57:12.566 --> 57:14.467
- <i>And then Claire turned up.</i>
- <i>Yeah. I remember that.</i>

57:14.502 --> 57:16.203
<i>I think... well a bit
too much wine I think.</i>

57:16.237 --> 57:17.905
<i>She wasn't the only one.</i>

57:17.939 --> 57:19.740
- Another time.
- Don't be such a boring old fart.

57:19.774 --> 57:22.143
- Good night.
- Good night.

57:22.176 --> 57:24.111
<i>But I don't remember
if Vera was there.</i>

57:24.145 --> 57:26.580
- <i>Did you see her?</i>
- <i>I actually can't remember.</i>

57:26.614 --> 57:28.481
<i>If Emil had been
on his way home,</i>

57:28.516 --> 57:30.251
<i>it should have
taken him 20 minutes,</i>

57:30.284 --> 57:32.485
<i>or 30 at the most,</i>

57:32.520 --> 57:34.655
even in his condition.

57:34.689 --> 57:38.592
Emil lived there with parents
and a younger sister.

57:38.626 --> 57:40.962
It's the third house
on the left.

57:40.995 --> 57:43.998
His parents left Kaalbringen
three or four years ago.

57:44.031 --> 57:48.536
And Vera would have taken
this street on her way home.

57:50.304 --> 57:52.106
Of course, you wanna know
what Emil was up to

57:52.139 --> 57:54.008
during those hours, yeah?

58:40.021 --> 58:44.625
Right. So all you do
is push this red button.

58:44.658 --> 58:47.728
This feels wrong.

58:47.762 --> 58:49.130
Okay.

58:50.798 --> 58:52.967
It's rolling.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.969
Now you haven't done nada.

59:40.981 --> 59:43.184
<i>Yes, I got your emails,
and I'm not fucking interested,</i>

59:43.217 --> 59:46.854
- <i>otherwise I would've responded, wouldn't I?</i>
- <i>I just... I wasn't sure,</i>

59:46.887 --> 59:49.156
<i>maybe that you didn't get them.
It was the wrong email.</i>

59:49.190 --> 59:50.925
<i>Clearly, I got
the fucking emails,</i>

59:50.958 --> 59:52.326
<i>and I'm not fucking interested,
am I?</i>

59:52.359 --> 59:54.061
<i>Because this is my house, okay?</i>

59:54.095 --> 59:55.729
<i>I just wanna hear
your side of the story.</i>

59:55.763 --> 59:57.064
- <i>I said fuck off!</i>
- <i>Don't you wanna give</i>

59:57.098 --> 59:58.699
<i>your version of events,
of like...</i>

59:58.732 --> 59:59.967
<i>You just wanna
fuck with my life, don't you?</i>

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.002
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'm leaving.</i>

1:00:10.177 --> 1:00:13.714
Emil was a moron
even back then.

1:00:13.747 --> 1:00:15.649
It's totally immoral
to film someone

1:00:15.683 --> 1:00:17.084
who doesn't
know he's being filmed.

1:00:17.118 --> 1:00:19.987
Immoral?
Get off your high horse.

1:00:20.020 --> 1:00:21.388
It would've been immoral
not to let him make a statement.

1:00:21.422 --> 1:00:23.023
That may be the case,
but this definitely

1:00:23.057 --> 1:00:24.391
wasn't the way to do it,
all right?

1:00:24.425 --> 1:00:26.026
I was the one who filmed him,

1:00:26.060 --> 1:00:28.729
all you have to do
is pretend you weren't there.

1:01:53.981 --> 1:01:57.151
<i>Emil, hi. Sorry.</i>

1:01:57.184 --> 1:02:00.321
<i>I... I just came
around the back because I...</i>

1:02:00.354 --> 1:02:02.089
<i>I did ring on your door
but I guess...</i>

1:02:02.122 --> 1:02:04.325
<i>You need to leave,
Paula, you're trespassing.</i>

1:02:04.358 --> 1:02:06.060
<i>Um, I... I just...</i>

1:02:06.093 --> 1:02:08.796
Yeah, I can't let you
use that material, Paula.

1:02:08.829 --> 1:02:15.135
Well, it's my film so I can do
whatever I fucking want.

1:02:15.169 --> 1:02:16.470
<i>It was the wrong email.</i>

1:02:16.504 --> 1:02:18.072
<i>Clearly, I got
the fucking emails,</i>

1:02:18.105 --> 1:02:20.040
<i>and I'm not fucking interested,
am I?</i>

1:02:20.074 --> 1:02:22.309
I... I thought this is meant to
be the portrait of a young girl.

1:02:22.343 --> 1:02:24.211
You know, like a...

1:02:24.245 --> 1:02:27.448
"A community marked by grief,"
isn't that what you said?

1:02:27.481 --> 1:02:29.116
The... the loss of Vera?

1:02:29.149 --> 1:02:30.985
And instead you're...
you're twisting it.

1:02:31.018 --> 1:02:34.154
You're turning it into some weird
bloody police investigation.

1:02:34.188 --> 1:02:37.191
- It's wrong!
- You know, um...

1:02:37.224 --> 1:02:38.993
It seems like you don't
want me to make this film.

1:02:39.026 --> 1:02:40.528
You know, to be
perfectly honest, no, I don't!

1:02:40.562 --> 1:02:41.862
Why did you come then?

1:02:41.895 --> 1:02:43.864
Well, that's
a bloody good question!

1:03:02.049 --> 1:03:03.984
Look, I don't want you to leave.

1:03:04.018 --> 1:03:06.820
You and I obviously have a very
different view of morality, Paula,

1:03:06.854 --> 1:03:09.223
'cause you... you simply
don't seem to give a shit.

1:03:12.594 --> 1:03:15.296
- You're right.
- Yeah.

1:03:15.329 --> 1:03:18.932
I mean, if Emil doesn't wanna
be in the film,

1:03:18.966 --> 1:03:21.302
he doesn't have to be.
I was wrong.

1:03:21.335 --> 1:03:24.405
That is not what this film
is supposed to be about.

1:03:24.438 --> 1:03:26.206
So delete it then.

1:03:30.878 --> 1:03:33.347
Okay. I'll delete it.

1:03:33.380 --> 1:03:35.082
I'll do it right now.

1:04:00.608 --> 1:04:02.409
So you'll stay?

1:04:07.582 --> 1:04:10.984
You know, to my mind,
you should interview yourself.

1:04:11.018 --> 1:04:14.254
I mean, knew Vera
as well as anyone, didn't you?

1:04:14.288 --> 1:04:17.625
Um, you know,
I don't think anyone

1:04:17.659 --> 1:04:20.361
could know her,
apart from possibly Claire.

1:04:20.394 --> 1:04:22.162
But why can't anyone know her?

1:04:22.196 --> 1:04:25.999
I guess it's like, like, B said,
she was a...

1:04:26.033 --> 1:04:28.636
Well, she was the odd one out.

1:04:28.670 --> 1:04:31.038
To me she was a mystery.

1:04:33.675 --> 1:04:35.976
Or maybe you're just
in love with her.

1:04:38.513 --> 1:04:40.147
Wasn't my type.

1:04:43.951 --> 1:04:46.987
You know, a week before
Jacob Kall was arrested,

1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:49.390
- I was called in to see the headmaster.
- Oh, wait...

1:04:49.423 --> 1:04:51.258
because I really wanna
record you when you tell me.

1:04:51.291 --> 1:04:54.194
Okay? After dinner?

1:04:54.228 --> 1:04:56.296
After dinner, all right.
Fine.

1:04:56.330 --> 1:04:58.999
Just gonna stick this on you.

1:05:00.568 --> 1:05:01.603
All right.

1:05:02.737 --> 1:05:05.339
- It's a mic.
- All right. Got it.

1:05:07.007 --> 1:05:08.375
Okay. Keep it on your pockets.

1:05:08.409 --> 1:05:10.144
- Okay.
- Here we go.

1:05:14.114 --> 1:05:17.418
It's very surreal.

1:05:17.451 --> 1:05:20.522
Um, I actually might
have some more wine.

1:05:20.555 --> 1:05:23.157
- Do you want some?
- No, no, I'm good. Thanks

1:05:23.190 --> 1:05:25.092
I want my wits about me.

1:05:42.644 --> 1:05:44.244
I'm recording.

1:05:45.412 --> 1:05:48.982
Now? While I'm washing.

1:05:49.016 --> 1:05:51.485
Is this some kind of kitchen
sink drama you're making?

1:05:51.519 --> 1:05:53.220
You always need cutaways.

1:05:53.253 --> 1:05:54.988
Okay.

1:05:56.323 --> 1:05:58.058
- Here?
- Yeah.

1:06:01.663 --> 1:06:03.130
Okay.

1:06:04.666 --> 1:06:06.601
Okay. So just...

1:06:08.135 --> 1:06:10.304
Uh, start talking about

1:06:10.337 --> 1:06:13.040
what you were talking about
this afternoon.

1:06:15.108 --> 1:06:16.644
Oh, um...

1:06:18.245 --> 1:06:19.379
Well, yeah.

1:06:19.413 --> 1:06:23.016
Um, two weeks
after Vera disappeared,

1:06:23.050 --> 1:06:26.086
<i>I was called in
to see Neumann-Hansen.</i>

1:06:26.119 --> 1:06:27.287
<i>The headmaster.</i>

1:06:28.255 --> 1:06:29.591
<i>Exactly.</i>

1:06:32.092 --> 1:06:35.295
<i>How are the
reports coming along Henry?</i>

1:06:35.329 --> 1:06:37.532
<i>It can be a bit of a challenge
the first time around.</i>

1:06:37.565 --> 1:06:39.066
Yeah, to say the least.

1:06:39.099 --> 1:06:40.735
Um, the special assignment
in literature,

1:06:40.768 --> 1:06:45.740
the essay, has been, uh,
the deciding factor for most of them.

1:06:45.773 --> 1:06:47.374
It's a grave responsibility.

1:06:47.407 --> 1:06:50.277
- Mm-hmm.
- Their futures are at stake.

1:06:50.310 --> 1:06:52.780
But I'm more than happy to help
you if you feel unsure about it.

1:06:52.814 --> 1:06:54.414
Oh, thank... yes.

1:06:54.448 --> 1:06:56.718
I... I'm not gonna say
no to that.

1:06:56.751 --> 1:06:58.218
I've only been
with them a term so...

1:06:58.252 --> 1:07:00.387
- Good.
- Oh, bring me the results,

1:07:00.420 --> 1:07:02.557
and we'll look over it together.

1:07:02.590 --> 1:07:04.993
Thank you.
Thanks.

1:07:07.427 --> 1:07:09.229
Vera Kall...

1:07:11.866 --> 1:07:14.167
Did she have time
to hand in her essay?

1:07:14.201 --> 1:07:17.304
Sadly, no.
It didn't work out that way.

1:07:24.512 --> 1:07:28.081
<i>I regretted it almost
immediately, you know?</i>

1:07:28.115 --> 1:07:30.083
<i>You know, I...
I knew very well</i>

1:07:30.117 --> 1:07:31.719
<i>that Vera had been getting
good marks</i>

1:07:31.753 --> 1:07:34.589
<i>all the way through
her time at college.</i>

1:07:34.622 --> 1:07:38.225
<i>And I should have just
said to him, you know,</i>

1:07:38.258 --> 1:07:41.863
<i>I've given her the same marks that she's
been getting during her Autumn term,</i>

1:07:41.896 --> 1:07:46.366
<i>but Neumann-Hansen insisted,</i>

1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:48.402
<i>you know, he felt that
she must have had time</i>

1:07:48.435 --> 1:07:50.203
<i>to have written something
before she disappeared,</i>

1:07:50.237 --> 1:07:51.706
<i>and if it wasn't in
the locker at school</i>

1:07:51.739 --> 1:07:54.842
<i>then it must be at her house.</i>

1:07:56.578 --> 1:07:59.413
<i>So, I had to go around
to see her parents,</i>

1:07:59.446 --> 1:08:02.282
<i>which is the absolute
last thing I wanted to do.</i>

1:08:02.316 --> 1:08:05.352
Even if,
God forbid she's dead,

1:08:05.385 --> 1:08:07.855
she still deserves a proper
school graduation report.

1:08:07.889 --> 1:08:09.591
Right.

1:08:09.624 --> 1:08:11.191
And it must be fair.

1:08:11.926 --> 1:08:13.360
Correct.

1:08:14.529 --> 1:08:16.129
Just because she's disappeared,

1:08:16.163 --> 1:08:19.466
doesn't mean you have to be
excessively generous.

1:08:19.499 --> 1:08:21.468
Just fair.

1:08:22.670 --> 1:08:24.404
I think you understand
what I mean.

1:08:31.779 --> 1:08:35.683
Erich Neumann-Hansen.
Headmaster, City College.

1:08:35.717 --> 1:08:36.851
Hello.

1:08:36.884 --> 1:08:38.753
Henry Maertens.
I'm the one who called.

1:08:38.786 --> 1:08:40.187
Yes.

1:08:42.924 --> 1:08:44.559
Might we come in?

1:08:44.592 --> 1:08:46.561
Oh, yes, please.

1:08:48.763 --> 1:08:50.798
Sorry about the food.

1:08:50.832 --> 1:08:52.767
We are the ones
who should apologize,

1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:55.302
barging in like this
during your lunch.

1:08:55.970 --> 1:08:58.740
But we have decided...

1:08:58.773 --> 1:09:03.511
that Vera must have her school
reports, despite all.

1:09:04.344 --> 1:09:06.179
We mustn't lose hope.

1:09:06.213 --> 1:09:07.615
I'd like to take a look
at a school essay

1:09:07.649 --> 1:09:09.684
that Vera was working on.

1:09:09.717 --> 1:09:11.519
I don't know if perhaps
you know where Vera keeps...

1:09:11.552 --> 1:09:13.554
Of course, we know.

1:09:14.956 --> 1:09:19.393
I assume you mean
her special report on Céline

1:09:20.695 --> 1:09:25.432
that was due to be
turned in Friday?

1:09:25.465 --> 1:09:29.236
<i>I was anything but
comfortable with the situation.</i>

1:09:29.269 --> 1:09:30.571
<i>Hated it.</i>

1:09:34.408 --> 1:09:36.878
- Top drawer.
- All right. Thanks.

1:09:47.789 --> 1:09:49.824
I don't want anything
removed from here.

1:09:49.857 --> 1:09:51.893
Yeah. Of course not.
Of course.

1:09:59.801 --> 1:10:01.636
Could I get a moment to myself?

1:10:09.944 --> 1:10:12.714
<i>At first, I found it
very hard to concentrate.</i>

1:10:12.747 --> 1:10:14.381
<i>That was largely because
I could...</i>

1:10:14.414 --> 1:10:17.752
<i>I could feel
the presence of her father.</i>

1:10:17.785 --> 1:10:20.253
<i>His eyes just, like,
drilling into my back.</i>

1:10:20.287 --> 1:10:22.523
<i>Even though he wasn't
really in the room.</i>

1:10:22.557 --> 1:10:24.224
<i>But I could feel him.</i>

1:10:26.994 --> 1:10:29.329
<i>And then I got drawn into
what she'd written.</i>

1:10:29.362 --> 1:10:30.531
<i>She's very good.</i>

1:10:30.565 --> 1:10:32.867
<i>She'd largely finished
the work.</i>

1:10:34.569 --> 1:10:36.537
<i>And when I got home
I regretted the visit.</i>

1:10:36.571 --> 1:10:39.406
<i>It just felt like
we'd encroached</i>

1:10:39.439 --> 1:10:42.610
<i>or had butted into
their sorrow.</i>

1:10:42.643 --> 1:10:44.011
<i>What did it really matter,</i>

1:10:44.045 --> 1:10:47.615
<i>you know, what final grade
Vera received?</i>

1:10:47.648 --> 1:10:49.717
Sorry for disturbing.

1:10:49.751 --> 1:10:51.284
Have you seen Tomas?

1:10:51.318 --> 1:10:52.920
Oh.

1:10:55.022 --> 1:10:58.993
Yes, yes, yes.

1:10:59.961 --> 1:11:01.696
Yes, come on.

1:11:01.729 --> 1:11:03.598
<i>Come on.</i>

1:11:03.631 --> 1:11:05.967
Two days later,
Jacob Kall was arrested.

1:11:07.434 --> 1:11:09.637
How did that feel?

1:11:09.670 --> 1:11:12.540
- Surreal.
- In what sense?

1:11:12.573 --> 1:11:15.042
In the sense that we'd been
allowed to walk around the kitchen

1:11:15.076 --> 1:11:18.079
where Vera had been
beaten to death by her father.

1:11:50.745 --> 1:11:54.081
Look... Samaria.

1:11:54.816 --> 1:11:56.349
It's for sale.

1:12:00.087 --> 1:12:03.024
Did you bring your camera?

1:12:03.057 --> 1:12:05.492
Oh, the house
isn't going anywhere.

1:12:07.427 --> 1:12:09.697
Feels very strange
coming back here.

1:12:09.730 --> 1:12:12.399
Really, what I
what I was thinking.

1:12:12.432 --> 1:12:15.670
She's buried somewhere
under your feet.

1:12:17.470 --> 1:12:19.006
Welcome.

1:12:20.575 --> 1:12:22.777
I must apologize
for the state of things here,

1:12:22.810 --> 1:12:26.113
but the place is sold as seen.

1:12:26.147 --> 1:12:28.516
Perfect environment
for children to grow up in.

1:12:28.549 --> 1:12:33.921
Great potential for conversion, renovation...

1:12:33.955 --> 1:12:36.791
Or rip it down,
build your own.

1:12:38.025 --> 1:12:39.861
Why don't you
have a look around?

1:12:40.194 --> 1:12:41.562
Thanks.

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:48.135
Contents included.

1:13:14.695 --> 1:13:16.998
It's exactly
like I remember it.

1:13:30.211 --> 1:13:31.612
Pieter Vogel.

1:13:31.646 --> 1:13:33.648
What?

1:13:33.681 --> 1:13:37.084
I'm just thinking maybe
she had a thing with Pieter Vogel.

1:13:37.118 --> 1:13:40.655
Really? Have you
spoken to him about it?

1:13:40.688 --> 1:13:45.126
No, he would never have been able
to keep his mouth shut.

1:13:45.159 --> 1:13:46.694
Oh.

1:14:01.042 --> 1:14:02.610
One thing's for certain, anyway,

1:14:02.643 --> 1:14:05.146
Pieter never slept in this bed,
because if he had,

1:14:05.179 --> 1:14:07.848
Jacob Kall would've
knocked him off as well.

1:14:12.853 --> 1:14:14.722
Mm.

1:14:14.755 --> 1:14:16.624
Why don't you
have a look around?

1:14:16.657 --> 1:14:19.727
So, when did you meet Clara?

1:14:21.062 --> 1:14:22.930
Clara? Why do ask?

1:14:22.964 --> 1:14:25.199
Just curious.

1:14:26.701 --> 1:14:28.669
We met a year...

1:14:28.703 --> 1:14:31.005
a year or two
after this in Antwerp.

1:14:33.074 --> 1:14:36.277
What about when you were
living here in Kaalbringen?

1:14:36.310 --> 1:14:41.882
- What?
- Well, did you have some special lady friend?

1:14:41.916 --> 1:14:44.752
No. No, that wasn't, um...

1:14:44.785 --> 1:14:47.555
It wasn't in the script,
so to speak.

1:14:47.588 --> 1:14:50.257
- <i>Groundhog Day.</i>
- Exactly.

1:14:51.826 --> 1:14:53.794
Well, I know a couple
of the girls from our class

1:14:53.828 --> 1:14:55.696
who were more than interested.

1:14:56.931 --> 1:14:59.767
- Taboo.
- What did you say?

1:15:00.568 --> 1:15:02.303
Never on the cards.

1:15:04.905 --> 1:15:07.742
<i>I don't think I found Henry</i>

1:15:07.775 --> 1:15:09.176
<i>incredibly attractive.</i>

1:15:10.811 --> 1:15:16.217
<i>Um, he was so sweet
and, sort of, cute.</i>

1:15:16.250 --> 1:15:19.186
<i>And if you made
a special effort</i>

1:15:19.220 --> 1:15:21.322
<i>and seemed a bit interested
he blushed.</i>

1:15:21.355 --> 1:15:24.925
<i>So, without Henry Maertens,</i>

1:15:24.959 --> 1:15:28.562
<i>that last term
would have been bloody boring.</i>

1:15:28.596 --> 1:15:32.133
<i>Yeah, so, all the girls
had a crush on Henry Maertens?</i>

1:15:32.166 --> 1:15:34.235
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>
- <i>What about the boys?</i>

1:15:34.268 --> 1:15:37.238
- <i>Who did they love?</i>
- <i>You know...</i>

1:15:37.271 --> 1:15:38.973
<i>Yes, but you say it.</i>

1:15:39.006 --> 1:15:43.077
<i>Vera, of course.</i>

1:15:43.110 --> 1:15:49.083
<i>I think out of everyone
you really knew her the best.</i>

1:15:49.116 --> 1:15:51.585
<i>Yeah. Vera was...</i>

1:15:51.619 --> 1:15:55.056
<i>the finest, the best,</i>

1:15:55.089 --> 1:16:01.195
<i>and I still miss her,
so terribly still,</i>

1:16:01.228 --> 1:16:05.766
<i>and I think I told her everything.</i>

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:10.905
<i>She was always so wise
and thoughtful,</i>

1:16:10.938 --> 1:16:13.874
<i>as if she knew everything.</i>

1:16:16.110 --> 1:16:21.215
<i>Did she ever tell you
anything about herself, her life?</i>

1:16:21.248 --> 1:16:24.085
<i>Oh, no. She didn't.</i>

1:16:24.819 --> 1:16:26.654
<i>Hardly anything.</i>

1:16:27.288 --> 1:16:29.023
<i>Some things.</i>

1:16:30.224 --> 1:16:32.693
<i>I know she had
a tough time at home...</i>

1:16:32.726 --> 1:16:35.096
<i>I saw her bruises.</i>

1:16:35.129 --> 1:16:38.199
<i>She... she tried
covering them up with makeup.</i>

1:16:38.232 --> 1:16:41.368
Hi. Yes, yeah.
I... I have it right here.

1:16:41.402 --> 1:16:43.637
That's... that's why
I tried to call you earlier.

1:16:43.671 --> 1:16:45.973
Um... Ah, no, it's in the car.

1:16:46.006 --> 1:16:48.876
<i>Never talked about it
ever, she didn't want pity.</i>

1:16:48.909 --> 1:16:51.011
<i>Do you think maybe she was gay?</i>

1:16:51.045 --> 1:16:54.248
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Well, just, you know, that...</i>

1:16:54.281 --> 1:16:56.150
<i>As you said,
all the boys were interested,</i>

1:16:56.183 --> 1:16:58.652
<i>but she was just really didn't
seem to care about at all.</i>

1:16:58.686 --> 1:17:00.287
<i>It's not
so very surprising, you know.</i>

1:17:00.321 --> 1:17:01.922
<i>Vera was smart.</i>

1:17:01.956 --> 1:17:04.959
<i>And she just wanted
school to be over</i>

1:17:04.992 --> 1:17:06.994
<i>so she could start living.</i>

1:17:07.027 --> 1:17:09.396
<i>She longed to get away
from her family.</i>

1:17:09.430 --> 1:17:10.965
<i>No wonder.</i>

1:17:10.998 --> 1:17:14.068
<i>And did she...</i>

1:17:14.101 --> 1:17:15.302
<i>Did she have a boyfriend?</i>

1:17:15.336 --> 1:17:16.737
<i>Not that I know of.</i>

1:17:17.905 --> 1:17:22.243
<i>Maybe Maertens, if so.</i>

1:17:22.910 --> 1:17:24.778
<i>Henry Maertens?</i>

1:17:24.812 --> 1:17:27.882
<i>Yeah.
But she never told me anything.</i>

1:17:29.316 --> 1:17:31.852
Yeah.

1:17:34.755 --> 1:17:37.725
Great. Yeah. I'll...
I'll speak to you.

1:17:37.758 --> 1:17:40.861
<i>But if you'll ask me,
I'd say Henry.</i>

1:17:45.132 --> 1:17:47.301
When did you
meet with Claire Meitens?

1:17:49.770 --> 1:17:51.438
Before you and I met in Maardam.

1:17:57.912 --> 1:17:59.980
And when were you
gonna tell me that?

1:18:01.315 --> 1:18:04.952
- Well... I...
- Or...

1:18:04.985 --> 1:18:06.320
You know, I don't know
what to think, Henry,

1:18:06.353 --> 1:18:07.888
because I know
that you haven't been honest,

1:18:07.922 --> 1:18:09.857
- and I know that you've lied.
- Lied?!

1:18:09.890 --> 1:18:12.826
Lied, Paula?!
You're the one who's lied!

1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:15.129
- Yes, okay!
- Yeah, do you know what I think this is?!

1:18:15.162 --> 1:18:18.165
This is jealousy!
That's what this bloody film is!

1:18:18.199 --> 1:18:21.101
Your jealousy and the fact that
Vera wasn't in love with you.

1:18:21.135 --> 1:18:23.804
- Okay, that's not true.
- 'Cause that's what this whole bloody film is, isn't it?

1:18:23.837 --> 1:18:28.409
It's not actually about Vera,
it's about your gigantic narcissistic ego.

1:18:38.852 --> 1:18:41.188
Yeah, I was in love with her.

1:18:42.790 --> 1:18:45.192
But I accepted
that it wasn't mutual.

1:18:45.226 --> 1:18:47.061
You see, I knew it.

1:18:47.094 --> 1:18:49.430
You've got a fucking weird way of
working, you know that?

1:18:49.463 --> 1:18:51.365
I mean,
you and your twisted theories.

1:18:51.398 --> 1:18:53.400
And whether something
is true or not,

1:18:53.434 --> 1:18:55.402
it just seems to be
fucking irrelevant to you.

1:18:55.436 --> 1:18:59.940
Yeah, well, if it's not true, Henry,
then why don't you explain this?

1:19:09.483 --> 1:19:14.755
"Be thou the rainbow
and the storms of life. -H"

1:19:15.189 --> 1:19:16.991
For Henry?

1:19:18.859 --> 1:19:20.327
Where did you get this?

1:19:22.129 --> 1:19:25.032
I found it in Samaria
about a month ago.

1:19:29.436 --> 1:19:32.540
- You don't know shit.
- And you do?

1:19:38.345 --> 1:19:43.017
I loved Vera...
and she loved me.

1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:54.461
No camera.

1:19:56.263 --> 1:19:57.532
No camera.

1:20:02.570 --> 1:20:04.539
Just give me some time.

1:20:17.051 --> 1:20:19.521
There's a darkness to it
and a sense of foreboding to it.

1:20:19.554 --> 1:20:22.323
But there really
is a sense of passion.

1:20:22.356 --> 1:20:23.625
There really is
a sense of passion,

1:20:23.658 --> 1:20:25.092
but let me ask you
this one question:

1:20:25.125 --> 1:20:26.528
Do you not think
there is a pessimism

1:20:26.561 --> 1:20:27.961
to the whole thing,
do you not think that there is

1:20:27.995 --> 1:20:29.263
death on every single page?

1:20:29.296 --> 1:20:31.899
I would say
exactly the opposite.

1:20:31.932 --> 1:20:36.270
I think the language is so full of
life and so incredibly beautiful.

1:20:36.303 --> 1:20:39.006
I would like to write about
Céline's use of language instead.

1:20:39.039 --> 1:20:41.875
<i>I set aside about 30
minutes, I think,</i>

1:20:41.909 --> 1:20:44.244
<i>but we must have sat there
for about two hours.</i>

1:20:44.278 --> 1:20:47.649
<i>I would never normally have devoted
so much time to just one student,</i>

1:20:47.682 --> 1:20:52.319
<i>but, uh...
I didn't want to leave,</i>

1:20:54.955 --> 1:20:56.256
And I liked her being there.

1:20:56.290 --> 1:20:59.460
I liked...

1:20:59.493 --> 1:21:06.568
I liked her laugh,
and her thoughts, and her...

1:21:09.370 --> 1:21:13.407
Her everything, I suppose.

1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:17.010
We agreed to meet again the
very next afternoon, I remember.

1:21:17.044 --> 1:21:21.348
Under the pretext of Vera wanted
to talk about her idea of...

1:21:21.382 --> 1:21:24.218
of Céline's use of language,
but we both knew that wasn't the reason.

1:21:24.251 --> 1:21:28.255
I mean, we... we made up
various different excuses

1:21:28.288 --> 1:21:29.990
along the way
just to be together.

1:21:30.023 --> 1:21:31.559
It's getting a bit cold.
I'm gonna run in

1:21:31.593 --> 1:21:33.494
and get a jumper, okay?
Do you... do you want one?

1:21:33.528 --> 1:21:35.162
No, thanks.

1:21:49.977 --> 1:21:51.646
The library obviously

1:21:51.679 --> 1:21:54.982
<i>had its fixed opening hours...</i>

1:21:57.384 --> 1:21:59.186
<i>but I had a key.</i>

1:22:01.288 --> 1:22:02.557
<i>So, we knew we wouldn't
be disturbed,</i>

1:22:02.590 --> 1:22:04.391
<i>well, at least
for a little while.</i>

1:22:55.142 --> 1:22:57.177
<i>You must've had
a fuck load of luck.</i>

1:22:57.211 --> 1:22:59.079
<i>Well, then, maybe.</i>

1:22:59.112 --> 1:23:01.583
What would've happened
if someone had found out?

1:23:01.616 --> 1:23:03.417
Honestly speaking,
I don't know.

1:23:03.450 --> 1:23:04.786
I mean, it's out of the
question, of course,

1:23:04.819 --> 1:23:06.621
it was taboo, like I said.

1:23:06.654 --> 1:23:10.525
But also... beautiful.

1:23:12.392 --> 1:23:13.460
Hm...

1:23:16.196 --> 1:23:20.234
The following week I, uh,
smuggled her back to Mrs. Kuntze's house.

1:23:20.267 --> 1:23:22.436
I think Vera told her parents...

1:23:24.171 --> 1:23:25.540
<i>she was staying on the library</i>

1:23:25.573 --> 1:23:27.742
<i>or something
for an extra few hours.</i>

1:23:33.781 --> 1:23:36.283
<i>Maybe it's a bit exaggerated
to say that I smuggled her in.</i>

1:23:36.316 --> 1:23:40.053
<i>I'm sure, Mrs. Kuntze would've
been very accommodating.</i>

1:23:40.087 --> 1:23:42.690
- Meow.
- Shh.

1:23:42.724 --> 1:23:45.292
<i>We just...
we just had to be very careful.</i>

1:23:46.594 --> 1:23:48.763
It's just one, one bit...

1:23:48.796 --> 1:23:50.297
that I have to
talk to you about.

1:23:50.330 --> 1:23:52.199
<i>Vera absolutely did not want</i>

1:23:52.232 --> 1:23:53.735
<i>her parents to find out that...</i>

1:23:53.768 --> 1:23:55.369
- It's one bit.
- I can wait.

1:23:55.402 --> 1:23:58.272
<i>It wasn't even an option
and I understood it.</i>

1:23:59.607 --> 1:24:02.677
<i>I'd seen the marks on her...
on her body,</i>

1:24:02.710 --> 1:24:05.713
<i>not... not that she
talked about it.</i>

1:24:05.747 --> 1:24:07.447
<i>Maybe it was then
that I realized</i>

1:24:07.481 --> 1:24:09.216
<i>that I was actually
exposing her to a risk.</i>

1:24:09.249 --> 1:24:11.686
And now you're in trouble,
I'd say.

1:24:19.594 --> 1:24:21.829
And when I was alone,

1:24:21.863 --> 1:24:27.569
and all of this initial rush
had... had settled...

1:24:27.602 --> 1:24:31.171
I knew that our relationship
just could never work.

1:24:31.204 --> 1:24:33.140
What about at the party, then?

1:24:33.173 --> 1:24:37.210
On the last night,
did you not see each other?

1:24:37.244 --> 1:24:38.646
<i>But of course,
from time to time,</i>

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:39.781
<i>you might just
find yourself needing</i>

1:24:39.814 --> 1:24:41.248
<i>a bit of actual guidance</i>

1:24:41.281 --> 1:24:42.884
from your
highly salaried lecturer.

1:24:42.917 --> 1:24:46.320
And as you look up
eagerly seeking his attention,

1:24:46.353 --> 1:24:49.757
you are met with the sight of your
eminently qualified tutor, Wasserman,

1:24:49.791 --> 1:24:52.694
sitting bolt upright
in his opulent chair

1:24:52.727 --> 1:24:56.229
behind his imposing desk,
taking a nap...

1:24:57.331 --> 1:24:59.601
It's not true.
It's all a lie.

1:24:59.634 --> 1:25:01.869
How does he defy the laws of physics?

1:25:01.903 --> 1:25:05.172
We were able to internalize
this extraordinary feat

1:25:05.205 --> 1:25:07.642
of vertical hibernation with
the help of your Jovan's mobile.

1:25:07.675 --> 1:25:11.546
And, as you know, it was published
eventually in the college magazine.

1:25:11.579 --> 1:25:12.914
<i>Even though
it was very dangerous</i>

1:25:12.947 --> 1:25:15.482
<i>for Vera and I
to see each other,</i>

1:25:15.516 --> 1:25:19.419
<i>my body just ached for her.</i>

1:25:19.453 --> 1:25:21.556
Our only element of
regret, looking back on it,

1:25:21.589 --> 1:25:25.258
is that we didn't manage to record
the accompanying sound effects.

1:25:25.292 --> 1:25:28.228
Good night, kids.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1:25:28.261 --> 1:25:29.631
- Good night.
- Don't go, Henry.

1:25:29.664 --> 1:25:31.164
Dance with me.

1:25:31.198 --> 1:25:32.767
All right.
Good night, good night.

1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.334
I have to go, I have to go,
I have to go. All right.

1:25:34.368 --> 1:25:35.603
Don't be such a boring old fart.

1:25:35.637 --> 1:25:37.270
Okay. Good night.

1:25:37.304 --> 1:25:39.239
<i>Emil Bachman,
I think had stumbled home,</i>

1:25:39.272 --> 1:25:42.376
<i>and then I went down
to our usual meeting place.</i>

1:25:43.511 --> 1:25:45.747
<i>Far too early,
as it turned out.</i>

1:25:45.780 --> 1:25:48.750
<i>I thought it'd take 15 minutes
to get onto the bridge.</i>

1:25:48.783 --> 1:25:53.153
<i>I must have walked very quickly because it
wouldn't have taken me more than five, I think.</i>

1:25:54.722 --> 1:25:56.824
<i>And so many thoughts
were passing through my head</i>

1:25:56.858 --> 1:25:58.526
<i>as I waited and I remembered...</i>

1:25:59.894 --> 1:26:01.395
<i>Has she snuck at home</i>

1:26:01.428 --> 1:26:03.831
<i>or has she stayed behind
at the party?</i>

1:26:04.832 --> 1:26:06.534
<i>I didn't know what to think.</i>

1:26:08.268 --> 1:26:11.371
But then she arrived,
slightly out of breath,

1:26:11.405 --> 1:26:12.874
on her bicycle.

1:26:15.308 --> 1:26:18.245
And then we went back
to the Pampas, to my place.

1:26:26.888 --> 1:26:29.624
You're right, it is...
it is getting cold, isn't it?

1:26:29.657 --> 1:26:32.694
And then you went back
to Mrs. Kuntze's.

1:26:34.494 --> 1:26:36.798
She never went home,
is that what you're saying?

1:26:36.831 --> 1:26:38.666
I'm gonna go get a...
a sweater.

1:26:38.700 --> 1:26:40.768
- Well, I'll get it.
- Coming right back.

1:27:05.793 --> 1:27:09.329
Henry, I can...
I can explain.

1:27:20.908 --> 1:27:22.777
Stop.

1:27:22.810 --> 1:27:24.712
Stop, stop! I can...

1:27:35.690 --> 1:27:37.024
Come back!

1:27:38.559 --> 1:27:41.896
No! Stop! No!

1:27:44.532 --> 1:27:46.901
What the fuck are you doing?

1:27:49.937 --> 1:27:52.774
You're a sick person,
you know that.

1:27:52.807 --> 1:27:55.076
No, please...
Oh...

1:27:55.109 --> 1:27:56.811
No.

1:27:56.844 --> 1:27:59.614
No. Oh, no.

1:29:53.928 --> 1:29:55.930
- Are you awake, darling?
- Yeah.

1:29:56.864 --> 1:29:58.165
I have to go.

1:30:01.869 --> 1:30:03.704
We should talk, Vera.

1:30:03.738 --> 1:30:05.706
We're always talking.

1:30:10.477 --> 1:30:11.712
I don't think what we're...

1:30:11.746 --> 1:30:13.446
I don't think
what we're doing is right

1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:16.117
at this point in time.

1:30:16.150 --> 1:30:17.818
I'm sorry.

1:30:18.786 --> 1:30:20.087
What?

1:30:21.689 --> 1:30:24.659
I think we should maybe
take a break, you and I.

1:30:35.136 --> 1:30:37.972
The thing is, Vera,

1:30:38.005 --> 1:30:42.043
you never tell me anything...
ever.

1:30:43.644 --> 1:30:48.182
And I... I do see what's
happening, I do understand.

1:30:59.860 --> 1:31:01.228
I know this man is your father,

1:31:01.262 --> 1:31:03.864
but you have got to
report him to the police.

1:31:07.601 --> 1:31:10.071
I'm saying this
for your best interest...

1:31:10.104 --> 1:31:11.872
And that would be to not
be there for me?

1:31:11.906 --> 1:31:15.176
- Of course not.
- How soothing.

1:31:15.209 --> 1:31:17.211
You can't continue like this.

1:31:20.047 --> 1:31:22.850
Vera, Vera.

1:31:22.883 --> 1:31:24.585
<i>Wait, Vera.</i>

1:31:26.620 --> 1:31:31.092
Suspected assault,
damage to property,

1:31:31.125 --> 1:31:33.961
but you are also wanted
for questioning...

1:31:35.196 --> 1:31:38.966
for withholding information

1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.838
into the investigation
of the murder of Vera Kall.

1:31:43.871 --> 1:31:46.240
In other words, Vera Kall

1:31:46.273 --> 1:31:49.243
did not cycle home at midnight

1:31:49.276 --> 1:31:53.647
but three hours later.

1:31:53.681 --> 1:31:56.317
Now, although you were
well aware

1:31:56.350 --> 1:32:00.187
that the police investigation
into her disappearance

1:32:00.221 --> 1:32:03.090
was not making any progress,

1:32:03.124 --> 1:32:06.327
you chose not to
tell us what you knew.

1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:09.597
I thought she'd ran away.
I thought she was staying away on purpose.

1:32:11.098 --> 1:32:15.669
I thought she'd get in touch...
once things had calmed down.

1:32:15.703 --> 1:32:17.705
Or you're lying

1:32:17.738 --> 1:32:20.174
and we've got the wrong bloke
locked up in prison.

1:32:20.207 --> 1:32:21.876
I did not kill Vera, all right.
I would never...

1:32:21.909 --> 1:32:26.113
All right, then. I don't happen
to think that either.

1:32:28.883 --> 1:32:30.151
I loved her.

1:32:30.184 --> 1:32:32.853
Hmm. But apparently,

1:32:32.887 --> 1:32:35.923
not enough to share with us
what you knew.

1:32:35.956 --> 1:32:38.292
Well, that was the last thing she
would have wanted, for God's sake.

1:32:38.325 --> 1:32:40.094
She was terrified of her father.

1:32:40.127 --> 1:32:43.864
If we had known then
what we know now

1:32:43.898 --> 1:32:48.803
we probably would have arrested
Jacob Kall a few weeks earlier.

1:32:48.836 --> 1:32:51.305
We might have found the remains,

1:32:51.338 --> 1:32:56.343
or at best,
found her still alive.

1:33:04.718 --> 1:33:06.353
<i>He was hitting her.</i>

1:33:06.387 --> 1:33:10.357
<i>I saw the bruises on her body,
if he had found out...</i>

1:33:10.391 --> 1:33:12.893
<i>I didn't want her
to put her through that risk.</i>

1:33:12.927 --> 1:33:14.695
<i>How many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

1:33:14.728 --> 1:33:17.998
<i>Well, either that, or you were
just too much of a coward</i>

1:33:18.032 --> 1:33:19.633
<i>to own up to what you had done.</i>

1:33:19.667 --> 1:33:21.235
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>I mean, a teacher</i>

1:33:21.268 --> 1:33:23.204
<i>seducing a student.</i>

1:33:23.237 --> 1:33:27.241
Maybe not illegal
but inappropriate.

1:33:28.909 --> 1:33:33.080
In no way are you being dropped
from this investigation,

1:33:33.114 --> 1:33:36.684
but we're not gonna
hold onto you any longer.

1:33:36.717 --> 1:33:39.720
As for the assault,
you can expect a...

1:33:39.753 --> 1:33:43.657
a fine
and a conditional sentence.

1:35:27.328 --> 1:35:29.330
Should I call the police?

1:35:31.365 --> 1:35:33.467
That's ten thousand Euros.
It should be enough to cover

1:35:33.501 --> 1:35:35.402
the cost of your equipment,
at least.

1:35:36.303 --> 1:35:38.072
Move.

1:35:42.209 --> 1:35:43.377
Are you coming?

1:35:45.446 --> 1:35:46.880
<i>All her things were gone</i>

1:35:46.914 --> 1:35:48.782
by the time
I got back to Antwerp.

1:35:49.483 --> 1:35:51.285
Was she answering her phone?

1:35:52.119 --> 1:35:53.921
What did she say?

1:35:55.856 --> 1:35:58.325
What? Nothing endearing, then.

1:36:00.261 --> 1:36:01.929
I miss Clara.

1:36:04.398 --> 1:36:06.900
I miss my dog.

1:36:07.868 --> 1:36:11.539
Yeah.
You've paid a high price.

1:36:13.274 --> 1:36:15.209
Me too, in a way.

1:36:18.178 --> 1:36:20.481
Obviously, I shouldn't have
done what I did either.

1:36:22.149 --> 1:36:24.918
Definitely crossed the line.

1:36:26.954 --> 1:36:28.155
It's really made me think,

1:36:28.188 --> 1:36:30.491
I mean, your reaction
was totally justified

1:36:30.525 --> 1:36:33.294
and I should prob... No, I should...
I should apologize.

1:36:33.327 --> 1:36:35.829
No, it's wrong.

1:36:35.863 --> 1:36:38.332
I'm the one who's at fault,
and if I had just told the truth

1:36:38.365 --> 1:36:40.968
when all this happened
all those years ago, and then...

1:36:41.001 --> 1:36:45.573
Then I'd never have
anything to hide from you.

1:36:45.607 --> 1:36:49.243
Instead, I've just chosen to
keep a secret all these years.

1:36:51.378 --> 1:36:53.080
I loved Vera.

1:36:56.551 --> 1:37:01.055
My God, you must have
hated Jacob Kall.

1:37:01.088 --> 1:37:02.423
Probably still hate him.

1:37:02.456 --> 1:37:06.193
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1:37:08.462 --> 1:37:11.365
I hate him with
every bit of my heart.

1:37:16.136 --> 1:37:17.539
I've dropped the project.

1:37:18.405 --> 1:37:20.341
It's not gonna be a film.

1:37:22.910 --> 1:37:23.877
Good.

1:37:23.911 --> 1:37:26.280
It's just too, uh...

1:37:26.313 --> 1:37:27.615
Too heavy.

1:37:32.119 --> 1:37:33.521
Sad.

1:37:37.057 --> 1:37:38.425
Too private.

1:37:41.962 --> 1:37:46.200
Sometimes it is just better to
let things lie, like you said.

1:37:48.102 --> 1:37:49.571
And, uh...

1:37:50.605 --> 1:37:53.307
and maybe I just have to accept

1:37:53.340 --> 1:37:58.245
that she lies buried somewhere,

1:37:58.278 --> 1:38:00.381
the forest's edge,

1:38:00.414 --> 1:38:04.385
and that the memory of Vera
is more important.

1:38:07.187 --> 1:38:10.357
Sometimes I like to pretend
that the drunk at the station...

1:38:11.291 --> 1:38:13.927
- did actually see her.
- Mm.

1:38:13.961 --> 1:38:16.463
That she'd reached
an end point that morning and...

1:38:16.497 --> 1:38:18.666
<i>managed to get away.</i>

1:38:19.734 --> 1:38:22.970
<i>That in spite of everything,</i>

1:38:23.003 --> 1:38:27.609
<i>she actually boarded
the first train to Altmaar,</i>

1:38:27.642 --> 1:38:32.312
<i>while the rest of us were
lying there, sleeping it off,</i>

1:38:32.346 --> 1:38:37.084
<i>she packed her bag
and left Samaria for good.</i>

1:38:39.286 --> 1:38:42.724
<i>Perhaps without even knowing
where she was going.</i>

1:38:42.757 --> 1:38:45.593
<i>And for the first time
she felt free.</i>

1:38:48.395 --> 1:38:50.698
<i>Really free.</i>

1:38:52.466 --> 1:38:56.303
<i>I think she found a better life
somewhere else;</i>

1:38:58.038 --> 1:39:01.543
<i>another town,
another country...</i>

1:39:02.644 --> 1:39:05.613
<i>because she was
worth that much.</i>

1:39:06.781 --> 1:39:09.551
<i>Vera deserved
the best of everything.</i>

1:39:56.497 --> 1:39:58.633
- Who's that?
- No idea.

1:39:58.666 --> 1:40:00.133
I said her name was Clara,

1:40:00.167 --> 1:40:02.369
and she works in
our Brussels office

1:40:02.402 --> 1:40:03.671
unless I'm mistaken.

1:40:04.672 --> 1:40:07.341
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
