41:42.168 --> 41:43.167
and he can barely walk,

41:43.269 --> 41:45.136
I feel as though
we have documented

41:45.238 --> 41:46.971
enough evidence
in the Underground

41:47.073 --> 41:48.973
to confirm that
the black shadow figure

41:49.075 --> 41:51.275
this investigator showed us

41:51.377 --> 41:54.111
has been validated
through our own visual evidence,

41:54.213 --> 41:56.714
along with additional proof
of spirits.

41:56.816 --> 41:58.749
So although
we walk away injured,

41:58.851 --> 42:01.718
our mission here is complete.
