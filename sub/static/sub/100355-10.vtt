WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.003
- Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.308
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that?

00:04.352 --> 00:06.006
- Remember when
we dented history?

00:06.049 --> 00:08.704
- By building Heyworld,
we changed the future.

00:08.747 --> 00:11.359
- What you think of as
a haunting is a temporal echo.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.839
She is the you before you.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.537
- Zari, no!
- What is that?

00:15.580 --> 00:17.147
- You can't kill me.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.714
- No!
- I'm a god.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.327
- We're being hunted
by a pair of bloody gods.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.503
The situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.

00:25.547 --> 00:28.202
- Behrad is dead.
Can that Loom bring him back?

00:28.245 --> 00:29.768
- If we get the last piece,
yeah.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.171
- Oh, there you are.

00:41.215 --> 00:44.087
It's always the artsy types
with you, ain't it?

00:44.131 --> 00:46.394
- How many times must
I tell you my powers

00:46.437 --> 00:48.352
are not a tool
for your amusement, Clotho?

00:48.396 --> 00:50.180
- Wait, wait, wait,
time out.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.182
But you did look different
at the time, though, right?

00:52.226 --> 00:53.792
- Shapeshifter.
'Course I did.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.272
But it makes the story
easier to imagine

00:55.316 --> 00:56.882
if you just picture me.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.536
- Yeah, just pay attention.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.365
- Anyway, then she said
her magic word...

01:01.409 --> 01:04.107
- Enchantress.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.286
I imagine this has something
to do with your theft

01:09.330 --> 01:11.071
of the Loom of Fate?

01:11.114 --> 01:13.203
- You disapprove?

01:13.247 --> 01:14.726
- No.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.902
Humanity's status quo
should be shaken up

01:16.946 --> 01:18.469
every few millennia.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.080
It's good for them.

01:20.123 --> 01:22.125
- Well, I'm glad you think so,

01:22.169 --> 01:24.823
because this
is a pretty big shake-up.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.565
I need to make sure
that no one ever finds this.

01:27.609 --> 01:30.220
Not even me,
and especially not Lachesis.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.221
You think you can do that?

01:31.265 --> 01:33.136
- Question. La-who?

01:33.180 --> 01:35.921
- Lachesis,
she's my elder sister.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.488
And also the
Leader of the Fates.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.577
Now, she's a real master
manipulator.

01:39.621 --> 01:42.145
Atropos kills because Lachesis
wills it.

01:42.189 --> 01:45.148
- It is you, Clotho,
that has the difficult task.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.150
- What, running and hiding?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.978
- I'm relieving you
of a piece of the Loom

01:49.021 --> 01:51.415
that has been your
entire reason for existence.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.809
Now that you are free of it,

01:53.852 --> 01:56.159
it'll be up to you
to determine what, if anything,

01:56.203 --> 01:58.596
is left of Clotho in its wake.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.252
- All I need is to make sure
that that ring is never found.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.863
Existential actualization
can come later.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.783
- You cannot run forever,
Clotho.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.135
- And that is the last thing
that I remember.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.789
- You have no idea what spell
Enchantress cast?

02:17.833 --> 02:19.008
- Well, that would kind of
defeat the whole point

02:19.051 --> 02:20.618
of going to her,
now wouldn't it?

02:20.662 --> 02:22.272
- But Charlie,
all we need is the third ring

02:22.316 --> 02:24.187
to bring Behrad back--
- And now you're telling us

02:24.231 --> 02:25.493
it's impossible to find?

02:25.536 --> 02:26.798
Maybe you could've
mentioned that

02:26.842 --> 02:28.365
before your sister
got on the ship?

02:28.409 --> 02:29.801
- See, this is exactly
the kind of thing

02:29.845 --> 02:31.455
I was afraid would happen.
- Stop.

02:31.499 --> 02:34.632
Passing blame
is not gonna help anything.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.199
- I'm sorry, Z.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.680
- This Enchantress
is a witch, right?

02:38.723 --> 02:41.813
Well, we have whatever
it is you are.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.989
So do some hocus pocus
and find the ring.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.295
- Yeah, well,
it's not as simple as

02:45.339 --> 02:47.297
finding Atropos's ring, love.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.299
Locating something hidden
by someone as powerful

02:49.343 --> 02:51.649
as Enchantress, that can take
months, maybe even years.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.738
- I don't accept that.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.523
Behrad is gone and
he's not coming back

02:55.566 --> 02:57.655
until you find the ring.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.744
So figure it out, magic man.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.878
Fast.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.730
- Hey.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.514
You know, um,

03:30.558 --> 03:33.735
I'm here for you if you ever
want to talk about Behrad.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.738
- We're getting him back.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.392
There is no point
in dwelling on it,

03:38.435 --> 03:40.350
because everything's
gonna be fine.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.700
- Totally.
- By the way, uh,

03:42.744 --> 03:46.617
when I went on that
totem journey thing,

03:46.661 --> 03:50.230
I met the other me.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.927
- Really?

03:54.016 --> 03:56.584
How--how is she?

03:56.627 --> 03:58.107
- She's great.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.370
Tough, cool...

04:00.414 --> 04:02.894
You must have a thing
for warrior women.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.070
- Only if they're from
another time period

04:05.114 --> 04:08.596
and eventually will leave me,
sure.

04:08.639 --> 04:12.252
Did she have a message for me?

04:12.295 --> 04:14.166
- No.

04:16.995 --> 04:21.391
But I can tell
she really cares about you.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.654
- I really care about her.

04:23.698 --> 04:26.135
And just so you know,
I, um,

04:26.178 --> 04:29.138
I care about you too.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.402
- Oh, all right, lovebirds,

04:32.446 --> 04:34.012
look, I think
I've got something.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.840
Now, it won't be pretty,
but it might just work,

04:35.884 --> 04:37.929
so come on, chop-chop!

05:00.343 --> 05:03.128
- Sara, are you there?

05:03.172 --> 05:05.609
Hey, Sara?

05:05.653 --> 05:08.699
Sara?
You all right?

05:08.743 --> 05:12.660
- Yeah, I just, um...

05:12.703 --> 05:15.880
It was nothing.
I'm good.

05:15.924 --> 05:18.056
- Listen, you got
hit full-force

05:18.100 --> 05:19.797
with the power of Atropos.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.321
- Yeah.
- I know you survived,

05:21.364 --> 05:22.626
but there could
still be repercussions.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.802
- Charlie, look,
I'm telling you,

05:24.846 --> 05:27.457
I'm completely fine,
all right?

05:27.501 --> 05:29.851
Assassin's honor.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.375
- Fine.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.203
- All right, you lot,
listen up.

05:34.246 --> 05:37.337
Our Lachesis's ring could be
anywhere in space and time.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.469
I'm gonna need to borrow
a little bit of magical energy

05:39.513 --> 05:42.211
off you lot to help amplify
the summoning spell.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.474
- Exactly how does that work?
- It's easy.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.041
All you need to do
is keep your mouths shut

05:46.084 --> 05:48.086
and let me use
your auras like batteries.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.392
- Is this safe?
It doesn't sound safe.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.828
- It isn't.
Any more questions?

05:50.872 --> 05:52.874
Good, let's hold hands.

05:55.224 --> 06:02.100
O circule, te vocavi ad hunc
locum et tempus.

06:02.144 --> 06:06.235
Veni hic, te iubeo.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.237
- Whoa, this feels weird.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.760
- It is weird.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.675
Kinda like that time
we went mushroom picking.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.764
- Focus, or you'll botch
the bloody spell!

06:13.808 --> 06:17.942
Vincio cum hunc loco.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.137
- Sara!
- Focus!

06:39.181 --> 06:42.445
Vincio ad hunc tempori!

07:05.163 --> 07:06.774
Where is everyone?

07:09.820 --> 07:12.170
- Wait, something happened.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.737
- Oh, bollocks.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.347
When everyone lost focus,

07:15.391 --> 07:16.914
I'd successfully bound the ring
to the house,

07:16.958 --> 07:20.004
but I was still working
to anchor it temporally.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.658
- So you, me,
and the ring have been

07:21.702 --> 07:23.094
whooshed into the past?

07:23.138 --> 07:24.922
Good work.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.490
- It's magic, love, it's more
of an art than a science.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.187
- Mm-hmm.

07:29.231 --> 07:33.453
Oh, my, are those guests?
I didn't hear the bell ring.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.759
Well, hello. I'm Mrs. Hughes.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.500
I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.937
- Oh, no bother, love.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.331
This is a lovely, uh,
boarding house.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.768
You know, I could see myself
living here.

07:44.812 --> 07:48.163
- Now where ever did
my etuiget to?

07:48.206 --> 07:49.599
Oh.
- Is it that?

07:51.035 --> 07:52.341
Thank you, my dear.

07:52.384 --> 07:55.387
I would've found it
eventually.

07:55.431 --> 07:58.042
Sometimes one just needs
to stop looking.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.653
- Right, totally.

07:59.696 --> 08:00.784
- Oh.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.657
Is that another
guest already?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.615
- It is, indeed.

08:05.659 --> 08:09.184
Dr. White at your service.

08:09.227 --> 08:11.229
Were you two going to book
a room, or...

08:11.273 --> 08:13.797
- Right you are.
Yes, me and my wife here--

08:13.841 --> 08:16.234
- Oh, we are not--
not married.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.542
- Well, I'm afraid
I'm a bit traditional.

08:19.586 --> 08:24.329
I don't allow single women
to stay in my establishment.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.897
But we are engaged, yay.

08:26.941 --> 08:30.814
- Ah, my sincerest
congratulations.

08:30.858 --> 08:31.859
Please sign here.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.861
- Oh, yes, of course.

08:35.863 --> 08:39.214
- And you will be
in room number three, upstairs.

08:39.257 --> 08:41.695
Supper is at 8:00, sharp.

08:41.738 --> 08:45.046
- Right, thank you.
Mr. White.

08:48.963 --> 08:51.008
- Huh.
You know, you should take note.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.662
This place could actually
look kind of decent

08:52.706 --> 08:54.446
with a bit of TLC.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.839
See what a difference a nice
set of curtains can make?

08:55.883 --> 08:57.841
- Yeah, all right.
Now let's, uh,

08:57.885 --> 08:59.582
take stock of our situation,
shall we?

08:59.626 --> 09:01.671
Now, I'm assuming you can
wield the totem like Behrad.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.934
- Mm-mm. I'm just holding
onto this for him.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.283
I don't have a superpower.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.242
Unless you count
having flawless brows.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.460
- I don't.

09:08.504 --> 09:09.679
- Oh, and by age 15,

09:09.723 --> 09:11.028
I built a social media empire

09:11.072 --> 09:12.769
valued at over $500 million.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.858
"The New York Times" called me
the most influential influencer

09:14.902 --> 09:16.033
of my generation.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.122
- Oh, "The New York Times," eh?

09:18.166 --> 09:20.037
- Yeah, it's like an app
that tells you the news.

09:20.081 --> 09:25.042
- So, uh, your superpower
is that you're sort of popular?

09:25.086 --> 09:26.783
- Aww, calling me
"sort of" popular

09:26.827 --> 09:28.872
is like calling da Vinci
"sort of" a genius.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.049
- Great.
Got it.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.574
- What about you?
What exactly do you do,

09:34.617 --> 09:36.619
besides wear
the same outfit every day

09:36.663 --> 09:39.100
and screw up spells?
- Well, I've banished demons,

09:39.143 --> 09:40.884
slain dragons, and walked
through the fires of Hell.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.451
I'm a sneaky bastard
and the greatest sorcerer

09:42.494 --> 09:44.061
that ever lived.
- Cool, cool, cool.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.585
Do you wanna go ahead
and "sorcer" something

09:45.628 --> 09:46.716
so we can find the ring
and get out of here?

09:46.760 --> 09:50.720
- Mm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.340
- Okay, so does that mean
it's in there?

10:02.384 --> 10:05.169
- Yeah, it seems so.
This is the Doctor's room.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.650
Maybe you could, uh,
influence him out

10:07.694 --> 10:09.739
while I go check it out?
- Mmm, see?

10:09.783 --> 10:12.133
You need my skill set already.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.135
- Yeah, right.
Good luck.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.625
- Can I help you?

10:25.668 --> 10:28.932
I seem to have come down
with something, Doctor.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.152
Might you be able
to give me a checkup?

10:31.195 --> 10:33.676
- Of course.
Be happy to help.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.461
Please, come in.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.681
- Perhaps we could go down
to the sitting room.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.684
I am a newly engaged woman,
after all.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.120
- I understand.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.688
One moment.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.127
- Ah.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.173
Hmm.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.789
- No ring?

10:59.833 --> 11:01.791
- We are still looking for one.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.489
- And you arrived with no
luggage, if I'm not mistaken.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.361
- Couldn't wait to get away
from the city.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.842
- Yes, I could see why your
betrothed would want to get you

11:08.885 --> 11:11.061
to himself
as quickly as possible.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.497
You have a beautiful face.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.978
- Oh, thank you.
I moisturize.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.328
- It's not like my face.

11:17.372 --> 11:20.244
No one remembers my face.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.333
- Huh.
You know, you could, uh,

11:22.377 --> 11:25.989
look into getting
a rebranding specialist.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.600
- I'm afraid your case
is worse than I thought.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.080
I must insist
we return to my room

11:30.124 --> 11:34.519
for a more thorough
examination.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.434
- Oh, my gosh.
Look at that.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.522
No more cough.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.744
You are a real miracle worker,
Doc.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.833
You should just stay here,
relax,

11:43.877 --> 11:46.096
have a drink,
and I'm gonna--

11:46.140 --> 11:49.360
okay, bye-bye.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.540
Ew.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.293
-  John!

12:09.337 --> 12:10.773
John?

12:10.817 --> 12:13.428
- It seems we did end up
in my room, after all.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.387
Shall we begin the examination?

12:33.274 --> 12:34.971
- John, you killed him!

12:35.015 --> 12:38.932
- 'Course I did.
He's Jack the bloody Ripper.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.324
Behind you!

12:44.111 --> 12:45.895
- Blimey.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.593
Old Leather Apron here
must be an Encore.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.900
Hand me some rope now,
will you, love?

12:52.946 --> 12:54.251
- Cheers.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.949
- Captain Lance
is experiencing

12:55.992 --> 12:57.777
unusual activity
in the striatum,

12:57.820 --> 12:59.822
a region of the brain
that processes time.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.911
I am continuing to run tests

13:01.955 --> 13:03.652
to determine the cause.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.610
- So Atropos not only
killed Behrad,

13:05.654 --> 13:07.264
but also managed
to put Sara in a coma.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.788
I don't think
the team's gonna survive

13:08.831 --> 13:10.485
another run-in
with your sister, Charlie.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.313
- Well, if we had it my way,
we never would've run into her

13:12.356 --> 13:14.445
in the first place.
- Pardon me, but Dr. Heywood

13:14.489 --> 13:16.839
and Mr. Green are requesting
your presence on the Bridge.

13:16.883 --> 13:20.495
The Prognosticator is showing
unusual Encore activity.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.279
- Hey.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.454
You got this, Captain.

13:23.498 --> 13:26.457
- Right.

13:26.501 --> 13:28.285
Captain.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.986
- All the Encores
are moving through time.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.988
More specifically,
they're all heading

13:35.031 --> 13:36.685
towards a particular point.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.947
- Looks like they're
hunting something.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.557
- Or someone.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.298
Astra must have sent
the Encores after John.

13:41.342 --> 13:44.127
Gideon, pinpoint where and when
they're converging.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.737
See, guys? I knew
all my time spent creating

13:45.781 --> 13:47.304
the Prognosticator
would be worth it.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.654
- Ava Sharpe saves
the day again.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.134
- I'm sorry, Captain.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.875
It appears that
the Prognosticator

13:52.919 --> 13:55.138
is not equipped to handle
time-traveling Encores.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.749
- Ava, take a deep breath--

13:57.793 --> 13:59.490
- You know what? We don't even
know if Sara's gonna wake up,

13:59.534 --> 14:00.883
and if she does,
she's gonna find out

14:00.927 --> 14:02.580
that two of the Legends
are missing.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.974
This is beyond unacceptable.
- Let's just sit down.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.758
I'll brew you a cup
of your favorite herbal tea--

14:06.802 --> 14:08.369
I'm not just gonna sit around

14:08.412 --> 14:10.197
and do nothing.
If we can't track the Encores,

14:10.240 --> 14:12.590
we have to go after them
at the source--Astra.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.549
- I seriously doubt she's just
gonna agree to stop doing

14:14.592 --> 14:17.334
whatever her current
evil plan is.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.858
- That's why I'm not gonna
give her a choice.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.209
Nighty-night, Jackie-boy.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.341
Sweet dreams of disembowelment
and all that jazz.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.691
- What the hell, John?

14:26.735 --> 14:28.519
Astra must have sent him
here after me.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.739
- You know, not everything
is about you.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.784
- Yeah, well, it'd be a big
bloody coincidence

14:32.828 --> 14:35.004
if an Encore just happened
to show up in the same time

14:35.048 --> 14:37.267
and place as us
for no apparent reason.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.530
- Okay, fine, but I thought
you and Astra had a deal?

14:39.574 --> 14:41.706
- Clearly she got impatient,
all right?

14:41.750 --> 14:43.230
- Yeah, I know the feeling.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.535
Did you find the ring?

14:44.579 --> 14:46.015
- It wasn't in his room.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.713
Now something is interfering
with my magic.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.454
- Yeah, some great sorcerer.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.717
- Ooh, some great influencer.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.632
You could barely keep him
distracted for ten minutes.

14:54.676 --> 14:55.938
- Oh, I'm sorry,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.940
should I have let myself
be serial killed

14:57.984 --> 15:00.638
so you would've had five more
minutes to not find the ring?

15:00.682 --> 15:02.292
- You know what?

15:02.336 --> 15:04.381
We should split up so we can
both find this in peace.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.383
- Fine by me, sweetheart.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.045
- Howdy, ma'am.
My name's Clyde Barrow.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.612
- And my name's Bonnie.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.962
- And we're in need
of some accommodations.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.270
- Bloody hell,
they're all Encores.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.624
- All right, while I'm down
there, you two need to work on

15:29.667 --> 15:32.801
fixing the Prognosticator so we
can track down Zari and John.

15:32.844 --> 15:35.064
- Well, tech is not really--
- Charlie.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.631
- Sure,
we'll figure it out.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.763
- Um, I feel like somebody
has to ask you.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.984
Are you 100% certain you want
Gary to take you to Hell?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.943
- I was kinda wondering
the same thing.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.335
- Look, Gary's the only wizard
I have access to, and besides,

15:45.379 --> 15:46.771
I'm not only taking Gary
down there,

15:46.815 --> 15:48.338
I'm gonna need
some extra muscle too.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.645
- Well, thank you for noticing
the extra reps

15:50.688 --> 15:52.081
I've been putting
on the lat machine.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.691
- You ready, Mick?
- Oh.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.432
- Oh, Mick, I thought you were
taking time off

15:55.476 --> 15:57.086
to hang out with the kid?

15:57.130 --> 15:58.479
- She told me to go to Hell.
Where are we headed?

15:58.522 --> 15:59.959
- The portal to Hell is ready,
Captain.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.613
All that's left is for...

16:02.657 --> 16:04.833
me to drink some
of this demon blood.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.226
- Come on, Gary.
- Okay, yeah. Okay.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.838
- Ugh.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.363
Huh.
It's actually quite tangy.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.104
- Okay, how do we do this?

16:15.148 --> 16:16.671
- I will say some words,
and then the sigil

16:16.714 --> 16:20.457
will transport us to Hell
for precisely four hours.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.807
After that, we'll be
transported right back here.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.635
- Sounds good to me.

16:24.679 --> 16:27.290
- Enter.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.038
- Flesh become my flesh.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.040
Soul become my soul.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.869
Hades, firstborn of Cronus
and Rhea,

16:40.912 --> 16:43.828
I call upon you.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.482
- All right, Mick,
get ready to light it up.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.837
- Beer?
- Yeah.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.667
- This was a terrible idea.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.756
Should've worn shoulder pads
to blend in.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.671
- I like it.
There's fire.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.195
- Let's just find Astra.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.066
- About time we killed
the bitch.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.677
- No! John has been working
so hard to rehabilitate her.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.505
Also, I thought we didn't
use that word anymore.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.159
- You know what? I'm gonna let
the B-word slide this time.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.031
She sent a bunch of criminals
after our friends.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.510
- How do we even find her?
What are we supposed to do,

17:13.554 --> 17:15.556
just ask a random demon
off the street?

17:17.906 --> 17:19.560
- Where's Astra?
- She's at her club.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.780
Uh, two streets down,
make a left.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.869
- Wow, I didn't expect
that to work.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.219
Thanks, Mickey.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.749
- You know,
it's times like this,

17:34.792 --> 17:36.403
that I wish I hadn't
given up smoking.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.579
- Yeah, well, I wish
I had brought my own hairbrush.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.233
Guess we're both out of luck.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.061
- Why would Astra send so many
Encores after me?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.411
I mean, seems like overkill.

17:44.454 --> 17:47.066
- Again, maybe it's not
all about you.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.720
- What if they're after
the ring?

17:49.764 --> 17:51.635
- You know, I never told Astra
about the Loom of Fate,

17:51.679 --> 17:53.202
but you might
be onto something.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.946
Oh, look at that.
Supper time.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.818
You're not seriously suggesting

18:00.862 --> 18:02.559
we go dine with Hell-people.

18:02.603 --> 18:03.908
- I am seriously suggesting

18:03.952 --> 18:05.475
that you stay
while I handle it.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.390
- I am part of this.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.305
- And possess far superior
social skills.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.655
- Yeah, well, you bottled it
when Jack the Ripper attacked.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.396
Look, I can't look after you

18:13.440 --> 18:16.095
and figure out what Astra's
up to at the same time.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.922
- This might be Behrad's totem,

18:17.966 --> 18:20.229
but there is a little
warrior me inside here

18:20.273 --> 18:23.406
from a different timeline
and she's gonna protect me.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.278
- I don't even know
what to say to that.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.280
But I will say this.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.934
Even if I have to tie
you up myself,

18:29.978 --> 18:32.415
you're staying here.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.423
Quiesce.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.164
- What are you doing?
- Well, I can't exactly

18:42.208 --> 18:46.647
go out there
as John Constantine now, can I?

18:46.690 --> 18:48.649
I think I have an idea.

18:50.738 --> 18:54.698
- Clyde and I were tortured by
Manaxos the Mutilator himself.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.265
- Your pain was a mere trifle

18:56.309 --> 18:58.049
compared to what
the Norfulthing did to me.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.964
- I thought the Hellhounds
were the worst evil

19:00.008 --> 19:01.879
a man could suffer.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.621
- Who exactly are you that you
were worth Norfulthing's time?

19:04.665 --> 19:06.971
- I am, of course,
King Henry VIII,

19:07.015 --> 19:09.191
ruler of the British Empire.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.672
And what crime
sent you to Hell?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.848
- Mmm.
- We rob banks.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.155
- And I plunder boats.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.810
You may have heard of me.
The name's Black Caesar.

19:19.854 --> 19:23.292
- Caesar?
- Ah, and you must be Brutus.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.685
I always favored beheadings

19:24.728 --> 19:26.034
over stabbing someone
in the back.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.167
Less cowardly.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.039
- Supper is ready.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.302
Now, stop dillydallying
and come and have a seat

19:33.346 --> 19:35.522
before the food gets cold.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.491
- Excuse me, Miss Astra.

19:48.535 --> 19:51.320
Found this scum
lurking by the entrance.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.235
- "Lurking" seems like
an overly sinister way

19:53.279 --> 19:55.368
to describe it--
- Why are you here, twerp?

19:55.411 --> 19:57.239
- John Constantine is outside.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.588
He knows you're impatient
with him,

19:58.632 --> 20:00.503
but he has the, uh,
thing he promised you.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.026
But he doesn't want to come
in here and risk being seen.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.941
So if you could
take a quick break

20:03.985 --> 20:06.944
from eating...bugs
and come with me--

20:06.988 --> 20:09.860
- Waste my time and I'll let
my demonic friends here

20:09.904 --> 20:12.080
use you as a human piñata.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.350
- So that's where
Genghis Khan's sword went.

20:21.394 --> 20:22.873
- It's over, Astra.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.353
We know you've sent
your Encores after John,

20:24.397 --> 20:25.354
so don't play coy.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.095
- What the hell's an Encore?

20:27.138 --> 20:28.444
- It's what we've been calling
the corrupted souls

20:28.488 --> 20:30.054
that you've been
sending back to Earth.

20:30.098 --> 20:33.362
- I haven't sent a single
"Encore" back to Earth

20:33.406 --> 20:34.929
since John and I last spoke.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.887
- Kill her already.
- Good idea.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.628
- Wait, Ava.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.282
What if she's telling
the truth?

20:40.326 --> 20:43.285
- Come inside
and I'll prove it to you.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.901
- Ah, just in time.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.816
Oh, I love a good carving.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.166
- And who the devil
are you supposed to be?

20:55.210 --> 20:58.387
- I, my friend,
am Jack the Ripper.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.302
- You got quite
the reputation, Jack.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.435
Join us.
- Cheers, mate.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.267
- My mistake, sugar.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.790
- I would have noticed
if the ring was sitting

21:09.833 --> 21:11.487
directly in front of me.

21:11.531 --> 21:14.098
- So we are all here
for the ring.

21:14.142 --> 21:17.406
- I don't share me treasure
with anyone but me crew.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.103
- We've been set up.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.628
And I assume that we all got
the same deal, yeah?

21:21.671 --> 21:24.283
- The ring in exchange
for free rein on Earth.

21:24.326 --> 21:28.112
It would appear
we are in direct competition.

21:28.156 --> 21:31.333
- So then what the hell
are we doing eating dinner?

21:46.566 --> 21:50.134
- Oh, that's a bit on the nose,
isn't it, Brutie?

21:50.178 --> 21:52.702
Just so we're all
on the same page here,

21:52.746 --> 21:54.704
each one of us has
a Hell-weapon

21:54.748 --> 21:56.358
and we could well and truly
end each other

21:56.402 --> 21:58.055
right here, right now.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.797
- Clyde, the way I see it,
this here Jack the Ripper

22:00.841 --> 22:02.146
is our greatest competition.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.497
- Yeah, I think you're right,
peaches.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.803
Jack here never was caught
by the police.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.552
- Greetings, subjects.

22:16.596 --> 22:19.338
I'm your Queen,

22:19.381 --> 22:21.514
Cleopatra.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.261
- Yes, I see.

22:30.305 --> 22:34.396
They're very big
and impressive.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.660
That's not what
I came here for.

22:37.704 --> 22:38.705
Great, you all have
scary weapons.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.271
Now that we know that,

22:40.315 --> 22:42.491
is it really necessary
for everyone to get

22:42.535 --> 22:45.364
cramps in their arms?

22:45.407 --> 22:49.890
- You, of course,
remember Brutus?

22:49.933 --> 22:51.413
- Yes, of course.

22:51.457 --> 22:54.111
"It was not that
I loved Caesar less

22:54.155 --> 22:57.419
but that I loved Rome more."

22:57.463 --> 23:00.204
- We never had the chance
of meeting before.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.858
- Mmm.
- But I would have thought

23:01.902 --> 23:04.774
my murder of your lover
would be unforgivable.

23:04.818 --> 23:07.037
- Damn skippy.
Kill him.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.910
- I'm not a petty despot
ruled by past grievances.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.912
I'm a strategist.

23:11.955 --> 23:14.958
The most sensible thing to do

23:15.002 --> 23:17.134
is to work together.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.615
- As soon as one of us
finds the ring,

23:19.659 --> 23:22.401
it's off to the Pits
for the rest.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.403
- You're just gonna
accept that?

23:24.446 --> 23:25.969
As soon as we have
the ring in our hands,

23:26.013 --> 23:27.318
we have all the power.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.233
We can march right into Hell

23:29.277 --> 23:31.148
and demand our freedom.

23:31.192 --> 23:34.064
- Hey, hear, hear to that, eh?

23:34.108 --> 23:36.066
- All right.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.417
- Now, let's eat, okay?

23:38.460 --> 23:39.418
- Okay.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.947
- So where's the lug-head?

23:46.990 --> 23:48.427
- Rory's guarding our exit,

23:48.470 --> 23:50.167
and he enjoying
some entertainment.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.256
- Yeah, I'll definitely
be seeing that one again

23:52.300 --> 23:54.911
down here.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.261
Oh, you're no fun.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.568
Now, this is where
I keep all my soul coins,

23:59.612 --> 24:03.267
and as you can see,
they're all right...

24:05.182 --> 24:06.488
- Did you lose something?

24:10.405 --> 24:11.972
- No one with an "executive
privacy" button

24:12.015 --> 24:13.582
has good intentions.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.454
- My vault is empty.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.631
Besides me, you're the only one
with access, Tiberius.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.110
Care to explain?

24:20.154 --> 24:21.590
- Is this one of those
human pranks?

24:21.634 --> 24:23.331
You had me take them out
for you last week.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.464
- Like hell I did.
- I swear it.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.771
I saw you myself.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.164
- A shapeshifter.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.166
Damn it!

24:36.387 --> 24:37.519
- Oh, don't look at me
like that.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.347
He'll be fine in a few hours.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.481
Better, even, 'cause he'll have
learned to be less gullible.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.614
At least the most valuable
one is still...

24:50.358 --> 24:52.534
Who the hell Vandal Savage?

24:52.578 --> 24:54.231
- Oh, I actually know that one.
He's--

24:54.275 --> 24:57.496
- Shut up.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.323
I can't believe
she did this to me.

24:59.367 --> 25:02.152
- Wait, you know who stole
your coins?

25:02.196 --> 25:04.198
- Yeah.

25:04.241 --> 25:07.070
But she's...

25:07.114 --> 25:09.420
too powerful
for me to take on.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.422
- Okay, well, what if
you had backup, you know?

25:11.466 --> 25:13.686
Enemy of my enemy
sort of thing.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.252
- Fine.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.341
But this will require stealth.

25:17.385 --> 25:20.867
- Wakey-wakey.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.653
- The boys stay here.

25:28.222 --> 25:31.007
- Now that was influencing.

25:31.051 --> 25:32.748
- You really think there's
saint's chance in Hell

25:32.792 --> 25:34.402
that your truce is gonna hold?

25:34.445 --> 25:36.665
May I remind you that one of
them is ruddy Brutus!

25:36.709 --> 25:38.667
- Sorry, was that some weird
British-y way of saying,

25:38.711 --> 25:40.669
"Thank you for saving
my life, Zari"?

25:40.713 --> 25:42.192
Yeah, okay, all right.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.759
I was in a bit of a pickle,
I admit it.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.196
But may I suggest that
we use the few minutes

25:46.240 --> 25:48.024
that you bought us
to go and look for the ring?

25:48.068 --> 25:49.548
- Shh.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.784
- Sorry about this, hon.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.394
- Please, don't.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.135
- Don't be scared.

26:12.179 --> 26:14.573
"The evil that men do
lives after them,"

26:14.616 --> 26:16.618
and all that.

26:20.448 --> 26:21.884
- So who's this being
we're going to see?

26:21.928 --> 26:24.060
- The woman who found me
terrified and alone

26:24.104 --> 26:26.454
when John left me
to rot down here.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.151
She took me in and raised me,

26:28.195 --> 26:30.066
taught me how to make it
in Hell.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.068
- Wow, and now she's
betrayed you.

26:32.112 --> 26:35.071
- She was the one person
I thought I could trust.

26:35.115 --> 26:38.248
Everything I am,
I owe to her.

26:38.292 --> 26:39.902
- You know, I don't know
if that's some sob story

26:39.946 --> 26:42.252
or what, Astra,
but I know how you feel.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.732
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.081
- I think it's a pretty
specific story.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.431
- Yeah, well,
I had a mentor once.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.738
Guy's name was Rip.
I trusted him with my life

26:49.782 --> 26:52.436
until I found out that he
fabricated all my memories

26:52.480 --> 26:53.829
to make me good at my job.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.352
- That's awful.

26:55.396 --> 26:56.440
So what did you do
when you found out?

26:56.484 --> 26:58.442
Did you kill him?
- Ooh.

26:58.486 --> 27:01.184
I wanted to so bad.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.186
But you know what?
The one thing I learned is,

27:03.230 --> 27:05.754
the only way to keep going is
to take control of your life.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.148
Stop letting everybody act like
they know what's best for you

27:08.191 --> 27:10.672
and make your own choices,
you know?

27:10.716 --> 27:12.761
What the?

27:14.807 --> 27:16.635
So it was a sob story,
after all.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.114
- No, it was the truth.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.464
Thanks for the therapy session.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.771
Don't have too much fun
without me, boys.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.947
I'll be back soon.

27:36.002 --> 27:39.135
- Show me the treasure I seek.

27:43.009 --> 27:45.054
- Yeah, that compass must have
some sort of Hell powers.

27:45.098 --> 27:46.577
He's using it
to track the ring.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.405
- Okay, then we need
to get the compass.

27:48.449 --> 27:51.321
- All right, I'll grab it.
- Hey, I'm going with you.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.891
- All right, follow me.

28:03.464 --> 28:04.421
- Oh.

28:04.465 --> 28:07.860
- Whoo-ee!

28:11.733 --> 28:13.256
Hey.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.610
Well, that was bloody
convenient, wasn't it?

28:19.654 --> 28:21.351
- Yeah.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.358
- I tried to fight them,
just like Rory.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.752
- You folded like
a cheap deck of cards, you bum.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.755
Easy.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.192
It's okay, Gary.
I totally got played by Astra.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.762
On the bright side, there's not
much time left on the sigil.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.373
We'll pop back to the Waverider
soon enough.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.898
- Um, about that.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.290
I'm the one who cast the spell,

28:47.334 --> 28:48.727
so I'll pop back
to the Waverider,

28:48.770 --> 28:49.858
along with anyone
who's touching me

28:49.902 --> 28:52.034
when the time runs out.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.470
Sorry.

28:53.514 --> 28:54.776
Didn't I mention that?

28:54.820 --> 28:56.299
both: No!

28:56.343 --> 28:57.736
- Listen, you dweeb,
I gotta get out of here.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.302
I got a thing.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.435
- What thing?

29:01.478 --> 29:02.871
- Lita has a soccer match.

29:02.915 --> 29:03.872
She didn't invite me,

29:03.916 --> 29:05.613
but I'm inviting myself.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.789
- Sorry, Rory.
- And I refuse to die here

29:07.833 --> 29:10.270
without getting to know
my daughter.

29:10.313 --> 29:13.099
Do we understand each other?

29:13.142 --> 29:16.058
- What position does she play?
- Gary.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.149
Hold on, we were here

29:20.193 --> 29:21.324
just a minute ago.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.065
- John, we're going in circles.

29:23.109 --> 29:24.240
- Yeah, it seems like
it's not just my magic

29:24.284 --> 29:25.807
that's wonky in this place.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.983
- Okay, magic or no,
there's so many people looking

29:28.027 --> 29:29.898
for this ring--
it should've turned up by now.

29:29.942 --> 29:30.986
It's like--

29:31.030 --> 29:33.989
It doesn't want to be found.

29:34.033 --> 29:37.819
- Hold on a minute,
you might be on to something.

29:37.863 --> 29:40.517
"Sometimes you just have
to stop looking," right?

29:40.561 --> 29:42.258
- Why would we stop looking?

29:42.302 --> 29:44.260
- Because I'm beginning
to suspect that the spell

29:44.304 --> 29:46.349
on the ring
is of a particular breed.

29:46.393 --> 29:49.091
So if you want
to find the ring,

29:49.135 --> 29:51.441
you can't find it.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.705
You have got to hand it
to Enchantress.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.490
She is a crafty one.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.709
- Okay, it's not just gonna
slip our minds,

29:58.753 --> 30:00.189
so what do we do?

30:02.844 --> 30:04.628
- We drink.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.813
- I know what you did,
Lachesis.

30:18.904 --> 30:19.861
Who's she?

30:19.905 --> 30:21.558
- Astra, my dear,

30:21.602 --> 30:24.344
I'd like you to meet
my sister Atropos.

30:24.387 --> 30:27.477
I have wanted you two to meet
for quite some time now.

30:27.521 --> 30:28.957
- Your sister?

30:29.001 --> 30:32.047
- We've worn many faces
in our long lives,

30:32.091 --> 30:33.875
but we are family.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.311
Anything you need to say to me

30:35.355 --> 30:37.226
you can say in front of her.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.534
- I know you stole
my soul coins.

30:40.577 --> 30:43.232
- Of course I did.
I had to.

30:43.276 --> 30:46.018
Astra, they were becoming
a distraction.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.716
You'd amassed all this power,
for what?

30:48.759 --> 30:51.501
Parties? Gambling?

30:51.545 --> 30:54.548
You need to think
in grander terms.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.332
- Much grander.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.073
- You see, Astra,

30:58.117 --> 31:02.556
my sister and I
are two of the three Fates.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.689
The Loom of Fate belongs to us.

31:05.733 --> 31:07.909
- It is our birthright.

31:07.953 --> 31:10.346
Why didn't you tell me?

31:10.390 --> 31:12.871
- You weren't ready.

31:12.914 --> 31:15.699
Oh, Astra, making soul coins

31:15.743 --> 31:19.442
and using them to control
the denizens of Hell

31:19.486 --> 31:23.229
was a cheap reflection
of my former glory.

31:23.272 --> 31:27.711
Now that the Loom of Fate
is within reach,

31:27.755 --> 31:30.062
I want you to become one of us.

31:30.105 --> 31:33.456
- Become our third sister.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.198
- You'd have the power
of a god.

31:36.242 --> 31:39.288
Astra, this is what I have
been preparing you for

31:39.332 --> 31:42.117
ever since I took you in
as a young girl.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.554
- But what about my mom?

31:44.598 --> 31:46.817
John had promised that
he'd use the Loom of Fate

31:46.861 --> 31:48.123
to make it so she never died.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.952
- Astra, you need
to move beyond

31:50.996 --> 31:53.912
these petty human desires.

31:53.955 --> 31:59.395
I am offering you the power
to design destiny.

31:59.439 --> 32:02.398
You once sought to rule
over Hell,

32:02.442 --> 32:06.489
now you can rule over
the whole cosmos.

32:06.533 --> 32:09.405
Will you join us?

32:09.449 --> 32:11.233
- What do you say, girl?

32:11.277 --> 32:13.322
- Oh, trust me, Astra,
I know what's best for you.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.629
- Sister always knows best.

32:17.283 --> 32:19.981
- Of course I'll join you.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.636
How could I ever turn down
so much power?

32:22.679 --> 32:24.072
- Good girl!

32:24.116 --> 32:26.945
- There's just, uh, one thing.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.773
John Constantine's coin.

32:29.817 --> 32:32.689
He's mine to toy with.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.127
- Seems like a fair trade.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.143
Mmm.

33:01.501 --> 33:02.850
- I took care of Brutus.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.287
- And I got our pirate
friend Caesar.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.810
Any luck with the ring?

33:06.854 --> 33:08.290
- Damn thing might as well
be invisible.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.684
- Well, Bonnie,
guess we got no choice

33:10.727 --> 33:12.642
but to make the rest
of our fellow guests disappear.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.296
- Mm-hmm.

33:21.608 --> 33:24.567
- Now, what do we have here?

33:24.611 --> 33:28.310
- Another Hellian to kill?
Lucky us.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.226
I'm Jack the Ripper.
- Nice try.

33:31.270 --> 33:34.055
We already met Jack.
- That Jack's an imposter.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.753
Worse, he's John Constantine.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.059
- That liar!

33:38.103 --> 33:39.756
He must be here
to send us back to Hell.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.758
- Now, don't lose your temper,
Bonnie.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.152
We'll teach that grifter
a lesson, okay?

33:47.199 --> 33:48.678
- Ahh.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.506
Good old Mrs. Hughes.

33:50.550 --> 33:53.205
- Okay, I'm not thinking
about the ring.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.163
I'm not thinking
about the ring.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.078
- Yeah, that's not gonna work.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.037
- So you're just gonna accept
failure when we're this close?

33:59.080 --> 34:00.777
I'm not giving up.

34:00.821 --> 34:03.606
- Oh, I don't see it as giving
up, so much as, uh,

34:03.650 --> 34:06.174
accepting reality.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.915
I know myself.

34:07.958 --> 34:12.050
I'm a ripe old mix of, uh,
guilt and torment.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.922
If the Loom of Fate offers me
even one glimmer of hope

34:14.965 --> 34:18.534
of redemption for all
my past sins,

34:18.578 --> 34:21.885
particularly Astra,
then, uh,

34:21.929 --> 34:24.279
I'll never not
be thinking about it.

34:26.151 --> 34:27.891
- You know, it's funny,
I'm usually an expert

34:27.935 --> 34:32.766
at getting things
out of my head.

34:32.809 --> 34:36.726
Boyfriend cheating on me with
my assistant/best friend?

34:36.770 --> 34:41.601
No time to cry, I have
a fall fashion line to plan.

34:41.644 --> 34:44.212
Overhearing my mother tell
a friend she's embarrassed

34:44.256 --> 34:46.736
her daughter is so shallow
and self-absorbed?

34:46.780 --> 34:48.390
Definitely can't process that.

34:48.434 --> 34:52.220
I will check
my CatChat analytics.

34:57.704 --> 35:01.229
But my baby dying because
he was trying to protect me?

35:03.971 --> 35:07.975
There's nothing that can get
that out of my head.

35:12.675 --> 35:16.244
I was wearing the totem
when he died.

35:18.290 --> 35:22.946
If I hadn't been,
then maybe he--

35:22.990 --> 35:26.167
maybe he would've had a chance.

35:29.910 --> 35:33.522
Now, look, you can take it
from an expert.

35:36.046 --> 35:40.181
Nothing good ever comes
from beating yourself up, love.

35:40.225 --> 35:43.271
- Don't try to make me
feel better.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.276
John.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.670
What if we don't find the ring?

35:50.713 --> 35:52.976
What if I never get him back?

35:53.020 --> 35:54.978
- Yoo-hoo!

35:55.022 --> 35:57.285
John friggin' Constantine!

35:57.329 --> 35:59.461
- We know who you are,
and there's someone here

35:59.505 --> 36:01.463
you'll be just dying to meet.

36:01.507 --> 36:06.468
- They do say imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.821
- This passage leads outside.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.910
I'll distract them
while you escape.

36:13.954 --> 36:15.999
- No, come with me.
- Go.

36:16.043 --> 36:19.481
This is my house and I'm just
crazy enough to defend it.

36:19.525 --> 36:22.049
Listen, you can get
Behrad back, Zari.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.877
I truly believe that,
but unless you get out of here

36:23.920 --> 36:27.359
right now, then neither
of you stand a chance.

36:28.403 --> 36:29.361
- Okay.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.252
- Ava, I'd just like to say,

36:51.296 --> 36:53.515
you're the best boss
I've ever had.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.517
Well, the only boss
I've ever had.

36:55.561 --> 36:58.346
I'm more apprentice
than employee with John,

36:58.390 --> 36:59.782
and before the Bureau,
well--

36:59.826 --> 37:03.264
- Ah, finally.
You've come to kill us.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.962
About time.
I was getting bored.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.143
- Get out of here.

37:13.187 --> 37:14.580
- Astra, what made you
change your mind?

37:14.623 --> 37:16.364
- You're helping John
find the Loom for me.

37:16.408 --> 37:18.627
Might as well let you.
Either he'll come through

37:18.671 --> 37:20.281
or Lachesis is bound to.

37:20.325 --> 37:23.371
- Did you say Lachesis?
The Fate?

37:23.415 --> 37:25.286
- Wait, how do you know who--
- It's a small underworld

37:25.330 --> 37:27.157
after all.
Time's almost up.

37:27.201 --> 37:28.724
- Come with us!

37:28.768 --> 37:30.378
both: What?
- Astra, it is time

37:30.422 --> 37:32.293
for you to take control, okay?
Don't wait for them.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.600
You can help us find the Loom
and save your mother yourself.

37:34.643 --> 37:37.255
- Ten seconds left.

37:37.298 --> 37:38.430
The choice is yours.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.564
- Wait, did she ever, like,
channel an animal

37:42.608 --> 37:44.305
while you were, you know--

37:44.349 --> 37:45.741
- She did once.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.613
But it was--

37:51.007 --> 37:53.140
- Is that--
- Meet Astra.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.924
- Why does she have the sword?
- There's no time to explain.

37:54.968 --> 37:57.318
We got to move.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.322
- Where's the ring, John?

38:01.366 --> 38:03.585
I don't know where the ring is.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.935
And even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you Muppets.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.460
- John.
John, be reasonable.

38:08.503 --> 38:10.418
We are going to kill you
regardless,

38:10.462 --> 38:13.595
but it's up to you how painful
that death has to be.

38:14.727 --> 38:15.815
- You'd be surprised how long

38:15.858 --> 38:18.121
you can stay alive without...

38:18.165 --> 38:20.472
certain organs.
- Ah.

38:22.691 --> 38:24.214
You want your coat back,
don't you?

38:24.258 --> 38:26.608
- Mmm.
- You can all go to Hell.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.307
- Hmm.

38:32.179 --> 38:35.138
- Stop!

38:35.182 --> 38:37.010
- Cleopatra?

38:37.053 --> 38:40.056
- Yes.
I order you to stop.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.797
- You don't have that kind
of power here, honey.

38:41.841 --> 38:44.060
- Are you both serious?
She's with him.

38:44.104 --> 38:47.020
- Is that so?
Maybe this will make you talk.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.327
- I don't know where
the ring is, all right?

38:49.370 --> 38:50.980
- Funny, I believe you.

38:51.024 --> 38:52.852
What a shame.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.070
- Oh, cheer up, darling.

38:54.114 --> 38:56.464
We can kill him now.
- Mm.

38:56.508 --> 38:59.032
- No.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.346
- Solvite.

39:08.389 --> 39:11.349
Hey, you come back.

39:38.419 --> 39:39.899
- You okay?

39:39.942 --> 39:41.901
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:46.340 --> 39:49.212
Blimey.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.214
- What?

39:51.258 --> 39:53.129
- The bloody ring.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.703
Must've been here
the whole time.

40:01.747 --> 40:05.054
I guess I stopped thinking
about it.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.755
- Guys, we're here to save you!

40:09.798 --> 40:12.714
But, uh, looks like you, uh,

40:12.758 --> 40:14.934
took care of it on your own.
- Thank God.

40:14.977 --> 40:16.239
Please tell me
that you found the ring.

40:16.283 --> 40:19.417
- We did.
Thanks to Zari.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.897
- Fantastic.
- Good.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.812
- Wait a second,
are those Hell weapons?

40:23.856 --> 40:25.248
- Yeah.

40:25.292 --> 40:26.902
- We could use those,
especially--

40:26.946 --> 40:29.122
- Yeah, let's just get them
and get out of here.

40:29.165 --> 40:30.297
- Good morning.

40:31.472 --> 40:32.647
Are those even more guests?

40:32.691 --> 40:34.083
- Oh, um, no.

40:34.127 --> 40:37.478
So sorry, ma'am,
we were just leaving.

40:41.134 --> 40:43.745
- And, uh, here's me thinking

40:43.789 --> 40:46.139
you weren't allowed
to meddle anymore.

40:46.182 --> 40:48.010
Could've been
a touch more direct.

40:48.054 --> 40:50.839
- I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.581
Yeah, right.

40:59.805 --> 41:02.634
- See you around,
John Constantine.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.161
- So you got the totem to work?

41:08.204 --> 41:10.119
- Yeah, I did.
It was amazing.

41:10.163 --> 41:13.166
Terrifying, but amazing.

41:13.209 --> 41:16.474
I sort of felt like Behrad
was there with me.

41:16.517 --> 41:18.693
- He'd be so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

41:18.737 --> 41:21.304
Congratulations.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.785
- John! You're safe!
- Yeah, all right, buddy.

41:23.829 --> 41:26.701
Oh, okay, right, slow down,
all right?

41:26.745 --> 41:29.835
I'm happy to see you too, mate.
Hey, how's Sara doing?

41:29.878 --> 41:32.794
- Oh, she's still unconscious.
Charlie's sitting with her now.

41:32.838 --> 41:33.969
I'm gonna try
to distract myself

41:34.013 --> 41:35.710
by fixing the Prognosticator.

41:35.754 --> 41:37.320
- Technical skills are not
Charlie and I's strong suit.

41:37.364 --> 41:40.062
- I know.
- Whoa, whoa, hold on a tick.

41:40.106 --> 41:42.630
If that contraption is broke,
how the hell did you find us?

41:42.674 --> 41:44.806
- Uh, about that.

41:44.850 --> 41:48.506
- Hey, John.

41:48.549 --> 41:51.334
I hear we have a Loom to build.

42:16.925 --> 42:18.492
- Greg, move your head.
