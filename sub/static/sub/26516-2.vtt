00:18.018 --> 00:19.561
<i>Previously on </i> Bad Blood.

00:19.644 --> 00:23.106
All of you are now
gonna buy your drugs from me.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.566
Declan. There is Jorge.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.193
<i>One of the most feared
cartel bosses in the world.</i>

00:27.277 --> 00:28.903
One hundred kilos to start.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.867
You'll have seven days
to come up with my money.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.534
But if anything goes wrong,
you know what'll happen to you.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.037
- Who's that?
<i>- The 'Ndrangheta bosses.</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:39.280
<i>Every month, they gather
to report on their businesses.</i>

00:39.330 --> 00:40.999
<i>I have a CI
who told me about the meeting.</i>

00:41.082 --> 00:43.043
I wanna know about the newcomers.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.878
They're cousins from Calabria.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.671
<i>Teresa and Christian Langana.</i>

00:46.755 --> 00:49.049
We are here to help us all grow.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.801
- We gotta go along with it.
- They kinda scare me, Domenic.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.887
They will be easy enough to replace.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.431
Domenic wants to set a meet with Declan.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.850
- New family here from Italy.
- Keep me posted.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.311
We want you to be our partner in Montreal.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.645
I don't work for anyone.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.190
I got the address for the rooming house
I'm staying at.

01:05.272 --> 01:07.859
You're my nephew. You're staying with me.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.819
I've run contraband
for over a decade.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.739
I'm wondering if you're up for moving
something other than cigarettes.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.823
I'll think about it.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.116
My driver is standing by.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.535
Standing by?
They just picked it up already.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.121
- We will hold onto your shipment.
- Where's my load?

01:20.205 --> 01:24.250
Our offer is still on the table
for another 24 hours.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.337
You wanna tell me
how the hell this happened?

01:27.420 --> 01:29.255
Go ahead. Tell me.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.717
They had the PIN numbers.
Once they were on the docks...

01:32.801 --> 01:33.885
Stop!

01:33.968 --> 01:37.097
How... did... this... happen?

01:37.180 --> 01:38.223
This.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.933
It's a remote-access receiver.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.811
And, Frank, my port supervisor
got turned by the twins.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.355
<i>That greedy bastard slipped
the device into our server.</i>

01:45.814 --> 01:47.816
<i>Once this was plugged into the computer,</i>

01:47.899 --> 01:49.579
<i>someone must've been nearby with a laptop.</i>

01:49.651 --> 01:51.402
<i>They had full access to the system.</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:54.531
<i>They just lifted the PIN number.
They took your shipment.</i>

01:54.614 --> 01:57.867
Declan, I'm so sorry.
This is state-of-the-art stuff.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.454
- The city spent 10 million installing it...
- State-of-the-art stuff?

02:01.538 --> 02:05.208
A $4 piece of plastic

02:05.291 --> 02:07.544
and a rat beat your system.

02:07.627 --> 02:11.047
You, you went against me
for some extra cash.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.341
You went with them against me.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.181
You don't get to go that easy.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.558
You keep a hold of him.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.852
He'll be useful to me later.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.437
- But Declan that's my car...
- This happened on your watch.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.982
You be grateful
you're not in the trunk with him.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.484
Okay, I'll take care of him.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.321
Five million dollars
of product gone?

02:35.405 --> 02:36.906
It didn't just disappear.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.660
I'll pay 100 grand to anyone
who gets me a location on my load.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.496
These freaks are in from Italy.
A brother and sister.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.541
Yeah, that's right.
Domenic is now taking orders.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.502
Tell the Russians I'll let them
have full access to the dock,

02:49.586 --> 02:52.255
they've been begging me for it,
if they find me a location.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.966
- Wanna get a smoke?
- Not now, Reggie. Not now.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.553
I pay you to get me information.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.264
I don't care. Shake down your CIs, right?

03:01.347 --> 03:04.893
Get police records, wiretaps.
Just do your job.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.276
<i>Hola.</i>

03:15.153 --> 03:16.654
<i>I was expecting your call.</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:20.200
I'm just calling to remind you
the payment is due in seven days.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.785
You received everything?

03:23.828 --> 03:25.163
- Yeah.
<i>- Good.</i>

03:26.122 --> 03:28.708
We will be in touch with the details
where to bring the money.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.586
- You got it.
<i>- Very well.</i>

03:31.669 --> 03:34.714
I'll let you go now.
I'm sure you are... very busy.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.548
Bye.

03:49.145 --> 03:49.979
What?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.272
<i>Hello, Declan.</i>

03:52.565 --> 03:55.109
<i>I know this must all feel a little, uh...</i>

03:56.069 --> 03:57.278
heavy-handed, but...

03:57.779 --> 03:59.530
time was of the essence.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.700
<i>If you've reconsidered our offer,</i>

04:02.784 --> 04:05.620
we will return your shipment,
no hard feelings.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.749
I still think we could
do great things together.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.002
You haven't been doing this
very long, have you?

04:13.378 --> 04:14.462
<i>This job.</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:18.091
<i>Because if you had, you'd know
it's all about how you read people.</i>

04:18.800 --> 04:21.302
How hard to push, when to play nice.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.095
And you...

04:24.138 --> 04:25.682
you've read me all wrong.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.770
Hey, man. You okay?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.482
Yeah, yeah.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.752
Ah!

04:55.253 --> 04:57.255
Reggie! Stay down!

05:18.276 --> 05:20.695
Reggie! Get in the back room!

05:33.499 --> 05:36.461
You okay? Come on, down in the hole.
I need you to focus.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.546
We're getting out of here right now.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.175
Go around.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.644
This is the only reason why
I bought this house. Come on, come on.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.980
Christian, clear.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.070
Stay low, stay low.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.409
Keep moving your legs. Come on, come on.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.334
That's it. Come on, come on.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.739
Head over to the trees, all right?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.299
Declan! Come out!

06:25.760 --> 06:27.345
You wanna go in?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.430
Let him burn.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.875
Oh, not again. No!

07:39.584 --> 07:41.210
Hey. What are you doing? Why'd you stop?

07:41.502 --> 07:42.545
Come on.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.927
Hey, man, are you hurt?

07:50.011 --> 07:52.346
What's going on, Reg?
Look at me. Hey, hey.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.432
Hey, come on. You're okay, you're okay.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.850
- Yeah.
- Just... Just breathe.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.728
Breathe. You're all right.
Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.230
- Yeah.
- Well, what's wrong?

08:02.899 --> 08:05.735
I get attacks. I got meds for them.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.862
- You got them on you now?
- They're at the house.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.340
Okay, we'll get you more.
Don't worry about that. Look at me.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.242
You're safe now. You're okay, man.
You're all right. Look at me.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.495
You're with me.
There's no one following us.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.788
Listen, I got a car not too far from here.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.416
- We gotta get to it. Walk with me, yeah?
- Yeah.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.127
- Follow me. Come on, keep it up.
- Yes. Yeah.

There's nothing to it.

Too much flour. Not enough eggs.

Oh shit.

Hey, maybe put some clothes on.
We're all waiting downstairs.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.832
My apologies, ladies.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.756
This is the place?
- Yes.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.651
- This is the address?
- It's the right address.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.759
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.219
All right.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.983
You need to go to church more often.

Good day, everyone.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.156
You ever been here before?

10:15.239 --> 10:16.824
Why would I ever be here?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.703
The fruit here, it's terrible.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.186
Well, there's not a lot of orange groves
near Hamilton, so...

10:23.247 --> 10:25.291
All of it. Everything I've tried.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.669
Dry, tasteless. It's like taking medicine.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.058
What are we, uh... What are we doing here?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.924
First, let's take a moment to celebrate.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.221
We are now in possession
of Declan's entire shipment.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.514
Good work.

10:40.598 --> 10:44.226
Ah, we can unload that all in a week.
What a profit.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.645
We are not going to sell it here.

10:46.062 --> 10:46.896
Why not?

10:46.979 --> 10:49.857
We are going to sell it back
to its original intended buyers.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.319
And with Declan now eliminated,

10:53.819 --> 10:56.489
we are going to flood the market
in Montreal

10:56.572 --> 10:57.698
with Declan's own supply,

10:58.282 --> 11:00.159
cut the going rate by ten percent,

11:00.242 --> 11:02.078
make us a welcome arrival.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.580
We'll go over the details later.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.668
But, uh, now,
we have another matter to discuss.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.379
Teresa and I,

11:11.462 --> 11:14.674
we want to know why it is that you
have not expanded into fentanyl.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.010
- I've been saying the same thing.
- Take it easy.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.261
Is there a problem?

11:19.345 --> 11:20.745
It's, uh... It's too hot right now.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.515
It's in all the papers all the time.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.518
Hundred people overdose on heroin,
no one cares anymore.

11:25.893 --> 11:26.893
One kid...

11:27.186 --> 11:28.186
on fentanyl?

11:28.979 --> 11:30.022
Front-page news.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.317
And another reason.
I don't like it. It's dirty.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.027
It's not for people like us.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.784
A ball of fentanyl this size

11:41.867 --> 11:42.867
is worth...

11:43.285 --> 11:44.537
20 million.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.956
Now imagine five of these.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.126
You can produce it locally
and fit it in a backpack.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.209
Wait.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.630
What about our coke and heroin?

11:55.214 --> 11:58.134
A gram of cocaine,
on average, sells for...

11:59.552 --> 12:00.553
eighty dollars.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.806
If you do the calculations, and we have,

12:04.265 --> 12:06.559
with your bulk-purchase price,
your export fees,

12:06.642 --> 12:08.519
the bribes to police,
customs, and so forth,

12:08.602 --> 12:11.272
your remaining profit on that is $12.

12:11.355 --> 12:15.317
Fentanyl is 100 times
more potent than cocaine.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.279
We will cut 80%
of the cocaine out of that gram,

12:18.362 --> 12:21.782
add two grains of fentanyl

12:22.116 --> 12:24.493
to make up for potency.
The rest is filler.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.582
Our profits just went from $12

12:29.665 --> 12:31.250
to $50 a gram.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.753
That's a 400% increase.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.799
Diversify product, increase profits.

12:39.884 --> 12:40.884
Any questions?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.471
- Well, when do we start?
- Wait, wait.

12:43.554 --> 12:47.391
People are dying from this
because it's too strong.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.226
You're gonna kill off our customers.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.188
There will be some casualties
because of the potency,

12:52.271 --> 12:54.273
but this is nothing more than

12:54.356 --> 12:57.109
a simple manufacturing adjustment.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.904
This is the future.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.239
Where are you gonna make it?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.160
You're standing in it.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.369
A church?

13:07.995 --> 13:09.580
No one will notice a thing.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.834
Can you believe it?
They killed Declan.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.712
Yeah, I'll believe it
when I see it.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.256
Yeah, this fentanyl business,

13:20.090 --> 13:22.009
I don't care how much money is in it.

13:22.092 --> 13:25.012
Coke, heroin, that's one thing.
People know how to use that.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.096
Mint?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.891
But selling them coke

13:28.974 --> 13:32.144
and giving them this, that's just asking
for the cops to come down on us.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.747
- I don't want any part of this.
- Good.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.531
Let me and Nats run it.
We'll make a fortune.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.164
- I dunno about that. Pops made a point...
- Take a beat, shut up.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.792
You're not gonna do anything,
and you're gonna do what I tell you.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.448
Enzo, one thing you're right,
it's a dirty drug.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.408
I agree with you. I don't like it.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.161
But this is what the bosses
back home want, right?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.955
So we're gonna do it right if we do it.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.551
Hey, don't forget, I gotta stop
by the hardware store on King Street,

13:54.625 --> 13:57.395
- pick up some light bulbs.
- I got light bulbs with you two weeks ago.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.296
Yeah, I need more.
You got a problem with that?

13:59.380 --> 14:02.341
Zio, he likes it bright all the time.

14:02.424 --> 14:05.386
I'm not kidding. I go for dinner,
I leave with a tan like George Hamilton.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.156
- A dark house is depressing.
- You're throwing money down the toilet.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.140
If you're not in a room,
turn off the lights.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.060
Is it your money?
Are you paying for it? Shut up about it.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.271
Hey, according to the Wonder Twins,

14:15.354 --> 14:17.231
money's not gonna be
an issue anymore, Zio.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.983
Don't be so quick to trust them, Luca.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.777
Those ice cubes didn't come here
to make you rich.

14:33.914 --> 14:36.542
- What are we doing here?
- You're gonna check in.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.918
- What about you?
- No, not yet.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.795
Those guys are still looking
for you, right?

14:39.879 --> 14:40.754
I know.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.506
Don't worry about those guys.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.259
It's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be just fine.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.761
- But I got some business to handle.
- No. No.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.263
I wanna stay with you.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.973
- No.
- Can I just stay with you, please?

14:51.056 --> 14:53.893
Not yet. Take this money, check in.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.352
Text me what meds you're taking.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.076
I'm gonna pick 'em up for you, all right?

14:58.314 --> 14:59.815
I'm such a problem for you.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.859
- I'm such...
- No, you're not a problem.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.903
- I'm so sorry.
- No, look at me, look at me.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.237
You're not a problem.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.532
This is all gonna work out just fine.
Now go check in.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.619
Just get a room?

15:11.702 --> 15:14.246
Yeah. I'll see you soon. Go on.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.374
Fine.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.252
Text me those meds.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.336
Okay.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.540
You gotta give me more notice.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.834
- How many goddamn manicures can I get?
- Sit down.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.257
What do you have for me?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.052
Nothing. I just saw you.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.554
Nothing? He's talked about nothing?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.392
You wanna know about his sore back
or his bloated feet?

16:16.475 --> 16:17.977
We have an arrangement here.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
Yeah, well, you know what?
I'm getting sick of it.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.439
- Hmm.
- I did my research.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.483
What you're doing is illegal.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.819
And if anything happens to me,
you'd go to jail.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.532
I don't think you have
a clear understanding of your situation.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.076
What do you think happens to mob wives

16:34.159 --> 16:36.954
who cheat on their husbands
<i>and </i> rat on them to the cops?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.707
If I choose to tell Nats, they kill you.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.584
Your mob family won't think twice.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.546
You think Dom and Enzo
are gonna stand by the whore-rat wife?

16:47.047 --> 16:49.383
So, when I say jump,

16:49.758 --> 16:51.927
you pole-vault Olympic heights.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.264
If you don't have anything,
you get something.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.725
You're married to the one capo

16:57.808 --> 17:00.394
who actually wants to share
his feelings with his wife.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.229
Consider yourself lucky.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.981
Most of them just screw you on Sunday

17:04.064 --> 17:06.191
and beat you on Monday
when breakfast is cold.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.776
But you're right about one thing.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.987
I don't wanna have to keep calling you.

17:10.654 --> 17:11.654
Next time,

17:12.321 --> 17:14.491
you call <i>me</i> with something.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.161
Now go.

17:27.503 --> 17:28.505
What?

17:29.506 --> 17:30.674
That was good.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.642
Sorry I'm late.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.436
I need you to find two people for me.

17:42.519 --> 17:43.604
Let me guess, twins?

17:44.271 --> 17:45.355
Word travels.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.650
Everyone's talking about the new bosses
in Ontario, but no one has seen 'em.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.110
You have any pictures, names?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.112
Teresa and Christian Langana.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.823
I got no pictures, but you can't miss 'em.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.533
They're Prada Euro-punks.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.702
Follow the Cosoleto brothers
and their sons.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.120
They're gonna have to meet.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.539
That's triple your rate. Find those twins.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.042
- You got it, boss.
- One more thing.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.421
I got a nephew. He's holed up in a hotel.
He's out of his meds.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.382
These are what they are and the address.
Get them to him.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.969
- Didn't know you had any family.
- Neither did I.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.936
This cream smells like grapefruits.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.523
Why would I want my feet to smell
like some sour fruit?

18:27.898 --> 18:29.525
Citrus is good for your skin.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.068
This bottle was 18 bucks.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.945
I could just rub oranges
on them, then, no?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.989
- Get a whole bag for, like, 5.99.
- I don't know, Nats. I don't know.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.867
Something bothering you?

18:38.951 --> 18:39.951
Just...

18:41.995 --> 18:43.205
Just have a headache.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.873
You wanna hear about a headache?

18:45.582 --> 18:47.626
The prince and princess,

18:48.127 --> 18:50.408
they want us to move into fentanyl.
You know what that is?

18:51.338 --> 18:54.299
It's like heroin,
but a million times stronger, okay?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.426
A few grains of this stuff
can kill someone.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.555
Pops and Domenic don't wanna do it,
but Luca thinks it's a good idea.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.491
- Of course, he wants him and I to run...
- Stop!

19:01.515 --> 19:03.684
Stop telling... Stop... Stop talking.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.519
Why, what's wrong?

19:05.769 --> 19:08.230
Just stop telling me about your business.
I don't wanna know.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.690
Where's this coming from?

19:09.773 --> 19:11.573
Nobody tells their wives
about their business.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.110
There's a reason for that.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.070
You know? I'm not supposed to know.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.239
But I tell you everything. I mean...

19:18.949 --> 19:20.229
I like to talk to you, you know?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.494
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.707
Well, then, who should I talk to, huh?

19:29.209 --> 19:31.587
You're my wife.
I don't wanna keep things from you.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.847
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah? What's wrong?

19:43.807 --> 19:45.976
You grew up with this shit. I didn't. I...

19:46.059 --> 19:48.687
It's stuff normal people
don't have to think about.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.316
Look, you knew about my family
before we even met.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.276
And I've never kept anything from you.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.987
And I think
you even used to kind of like that, no?

19:57.404 --> 19:59.281
Some days, don't you just want...

20:00.032 --> 20:02.659
just a normal, regular life?

20:03.577 --> 20:04.578
Isn't that what we have?

20:05.370 --> 20:06.370
Hmm?

20:24.723 --> 20:25.974
Goddammit.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.483
Hey, Domenic.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.527
You need a guard dog.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.738
You're looking good.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.783
Yeah, I been working out a little bit.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.242
How about you?

20:44.576 --> 20:45.827
I heard you were dead.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.411
Nah.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.542
We've known each other a long time.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.921
You stayed away from my city.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.590
I've stayed away from your city.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.135
Everything was okay, right?

21:02.594 --> 21:03.637
So...

21:04.429 --> 21:06.848
I can't figure out why

21:07.182 --> 21:08.725
you're going along with all this.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.728
You can't figure out
why I'd wanna run you out of business?

21:13.021 --> 21:14.731
Maybe you need a new accountant.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.401
That's funny. 'Cause I know you.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.696
I know that you don't like headaches.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.325
So if you don't give me back my drugs,

21:26.660 --> 21:29.454
then this whole thing's
gonna turn into a headache

21:29.538 --> 21:30.747
that rips your head off.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.499
Now, that's funny.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.210
You know, from where I'm standing,

21:35.294 --> 21:37.337
looks like you're the one
with the problem.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.673
Why are you taking orders from these two?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.300
I don't take orders.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.843
Domenic, come on.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.930
Everybody knows that those
two beauty freaks are in control now.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.640
That can't taste good.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.727
After being the boss for so long.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.312
But maybe I'm wrong.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.606
Maybe you...

21:57.232 --> 21:58.942
have expanded your palate...

21:59.359 --> 22:00.819
into kissing ass.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.450
We took your drugs.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.618
We're gonna take your city.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.622
I'm here

22:13.540 --> 22:15.417
because we have history, you and me.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.712
So, let me give you some advice.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.215
You know me.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.426
You know what I can do.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.928
Walk away, Domenic.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.473
Walk away. You can do that.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.101
Otherwise, they're just gonna

22:33.185 --> 22:35.687
march you straight into the fire
and watch you burn.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.233
Allow me to give you some honest advice.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.278
These aren't some rich, spoiled brats
who are, you know,

22:43.362 --> 22:45.197
here to party with the Kardashians.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.532
Their father is the boss.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.785
I mean the boss of it all.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.079
You understand?

22:52.162 --> 22:55.040
He gave 'em a job to do.
They're not gonna fail him.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.251
They just made your 100 keys disappear.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.339
So if we go to war, Declan, that decision,

23:02.422 --> 23:04.216
that's gonna be all you, my friend.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.761
This ain't Vito you're dealing with.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.139
These people, they don't...
they don't got soft spots.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.350
They don't lose.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.644
Neither do I.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.238
<i>The twins took my drugs.</i>

23:26.321 --> 23:28.073
<i>They tried to kill me.</i>

23:28.156 --> 23:30.575
<i>But I'll be damned
if I let them take my town.</i>

23:30.826 --> 23:32.994
<i>So if I didn't get my drugs back,
and back fast,</i>

23:33.078 --> 23:36.289
<i>the cartel would achieve
what the twins couldn't.</i>

23:36.957 --> 23:38.917
So, how's things at home, Declan?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.680
- That's funny.
- Why are we here?

23:40.752 --> 23:43.046
I know...

23:43.130 --> 23:46.883
Teresa and Christian
have offered to sell you

23:47.134 --> 23:48.677
all of my shipment.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.680
- And at a damn good price.
- Don't buy from them.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.323
They're not here to sell.

23:53.765 --> 23:54.933
They're here to take over.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.853
You buy, you open the door for them

23:57.936 --> 23:59.354
to walk right into our house.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.981
They're coming for you, not us.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.899
I'm not getting involved in your shit.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.444
I need product.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.280
You can't deliver on what you promised,

24:08.530 --> 24:09.865
so I'm gonna get it somewhere.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.242
Well, I can't deliver
because they stole from me,

24:12.325 --> 24:13.869
which is like stealing from you.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.998
Those twins are here
to divide and conquer our city.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.583
If we don't hold 'em off now,

24:20.041 --> 24:21.793
in six months,
you'll all be dead and gone.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.171
So now it's "our city"?

24:25.213 --> 24:26.381
The way I see it,

24:26.882 --> 24:29.050
you're the only one with the problem here.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.137
No one is running me out of my town.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.598
You need a friend, get a goddamn dog.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.521
It's because of that winning personality,
you're really gonna go places.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.727
Screw you.

24:43.857 --> 24:44.691
Junior?

24:44.774 --> 24:46.568
Why should I get into your war?

24:46.651 --> 24:47.903
Hey, it's your war, too.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.696
You just can't see it yet.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.615
If I don't have product to move,

24:51.698 --> 24:54.284
Liam or Alex are going to do it
on my territory.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.661
You got good product, call me.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.456
But I got to stay open for business, man.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.248
Sorry.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.339
Why so quiet, Alex?

25:07.672 --> 25:08.715
Well...

25:10.300 --> 25:11.927
You and me are not friends.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.973
I don't give a shit about helping you.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.733
But you're right on this one.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.277
And it's me
they'll be coming for after you.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.361
Yeah.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.740
But I also need product to move,

25:33.823 --> 25:35.784
so what are you gonna do about that?

25:35.867 --> 25:38.036
When are they delivering it to you?

25:38.119 --> 25:39.371
In a few days.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.083
They're handing off
to everyone at the same spot.

25:44.501 --> 25:45.585
I got a plan.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.297
It's gonna work for you and me. Big time.

25:55.011 --> 25:58.056
I can't get this thing to print.
Do I need a password or something?

25:59.140 --> 26:00.140
Nellie.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.227
Nellie!

26:04.938 --> 26:06.314
You're cutting my funding?

26:06.648 --> 26:09.168
You have a problem, follow protocol.
Take it to your supervisor.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.278
Why? All he's gonna do
is put it in a memo for you.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.904
Tell it to my face.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.073
I have the most significant CI
in the Mafia

26:15.156 --> 26:17.659
in the last five years,
and you wanna cut me off now?

26:17.742 --> 26:20.222
You've been running this for how long
and what have you gotten?

26:20.287 --> 26:22.956
- A few drug busts...
- You gave Mike more money in his division.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.666
You gave Patrick more in his division.

26:24.749 --> 26:25.959
Terrorism and cybercrime.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.295
No one cares
about gangsters killing gangsters.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.547
But they care
if their subways get blown up

26:30.630 --> 26:32.173
or their bank accounts get hacked.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.967
You want more funding,

26:34.050 --> 26:35.810
bring me something the mayor
can campaign on,

26:35.844 --> 26:37.905
something the commissioner
can hold a press conference about.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.389
That's all they care about.

26:40.140 --> 26:43.143
Now get out before you say something
I have to suspend you for.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.233
What do you want?

26:51.276 --> 26:52.277
Have a nice day, sir.

27:06.541 --> 27:07.917
I've missed you.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.670
Yeah. So, where's my boy?

27:13.590 --> 27:14.758
Where's Wes?

27:17.385 --> 27:18.845
He didn't wanna come.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.185
- He said he was...
- It's all right.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.104
Just... Just fill me in on the business.

27:28.563 --> 27:29.883
How'd the meeting go with Declan?

27:30.690 --> 27:32.984
I made a deal. He's giving us good terms.

27:34.194 --> 27:37.197
But he just got into a war
with the 'Ndrangheta.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.866
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.704
You're running the show now, sis.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.207
It's your call.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.460
But, you know,
if I was gonna bet on any horse,

27:50.752 --> 27:51.961
even odds against him,

27:52.671 --> 27:53.713
I'd bet on Declan.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.850
- Gabriel, let's go.
- Where?

28:05.934 --> 28:07.936
The drop, getting our load from the twins.

28:08.603 --> 28:09.896
Give me your phone.

28:10.605 --> 28:11.605
Why?

28:12.065 --> 28:13.358
I said no phone.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.152
No phones.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.371
<i>Everyone is brought down
by someone on the inside.</i>

28:26.454 --> 28:27.789
<i>But I couldn't let that happen.</i>

28:28.456 --> 28:29.916
<i>I needed the bikers.</i>

28:29.999 --> 28:31.799
<i>And if I had a hope in hell
to make this work,</i>

28:31.876 --> 28:33.545
<i>I also needed reinforcements.</i>

28:37.006 --> 28:38.006
Boys.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.552
- So, what's the gig?
- I'll tell you when we get there.

28:40.635 --> 28:41.635
What gear d'you bring?

28:50.603 --> 28:51.603
Heavy metal.

28:54.983 --> 28:55.983
Precision action.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.902
- What do we need?
- All of it.

28:58.862 --> 28:59.904
Let's go.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.995
What time you got?

29:07.412 --> 29:08.496
Five more minutes.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.692
Looks like we're all in.

29:38.318 --> 29:39.318
So?

29:40.278 --> 29:41.798
Can't stop the winds of change.

29:42.405 --> 29:43.615
Or the smell of shit.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.034
You met these twins?

29:46.576 --> 29:47.619
No.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.414
- Think they'll show up?
- I don't know.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.212
They gave me a new location.
Two miles south.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.255
- Me too.
- Where?

29:59.839 --> 30:00.839
Three miles west.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.258
What about you?

30:02.967 --> 30:04.093
Nothing.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.888
They're splitting us up.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.348
You gonna go?

30:11.059 --> 30:12.685
Don't have much of a choice.

30:17.690 --> 30:19.317
See you on the other side.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.199
What the hell?

30:26.616 --> 30:27.742
What's going on?

30:28.785 --> 30:30.745
- What do we do?
- We wait.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.288
We still have our target.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.250
That must be them.

30:51.724 --> 30:54.227
So, where did the others go?

30:55.311 --> 30:58.273
Don't worry about their business.
We got your stuff.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.817
Teresa and Christian coming?

31:00.900 --> 31:02.735
No, you get me.

31:03.778 --> 31:05.029
So you guys got the money?

31:05.113 --> 31:06.322
Mm-hmm.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.284
Bring it over.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.427
Get ready.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.558
I'll take it on good faith
that it's all there.

31:33.641 --> 31:34.726
It's all there.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.232
Now.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.749
Let's go. Let's go.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.113
Don't move!

32:42.043 --> 32:43.127
Goddammit.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.215
- Where's the rest of it?
- I don't know.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.299
What? What?

32:48.383 --> 32:49.509
I don't know!

32:49.592 --> 32:52.178
- You don't know?
- I swear on my mother, I don't know.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.974
- I don't know, I swear.
- I'm done with you.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.102
All they said was they were gonna switch
up the drops on everyone. That's it.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.187
It's all I know. I swear. Please.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.857
It's your lucky day.

33:04.941 --> 33:08.027
You are gonna go tell
Teresa and Christian...

33:08.111 --> 33:10.822
- Mm-hmm?
- ...that this was Declan who done this.

33:10.905 --> 33:12.615
And I'm coming for them.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.826
Got it?

33:15.410 --> 33:16.410
Go.

33:18.371 --> 33:19.371
Go.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.958
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.389
Is this sexy enough for you?

33:36.973 --> 33:39.058
Because that looks like
a terrorist attack to me.

33:39.142 --> 33:42.520
Shootout in a cement plant,
two bodies, including my informant.

33:42.603 --> 33:43.980
This is just the beginning.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.397
This is war.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.026
Oh, and the owner of the cement plant

33:48.109 --> 33:50.028
is friends with the Minister of Finance.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.823
You got four weeks. Show me something.

34:17.597 --> 34:18.681
- You saw?
- I did.

34:18.764 --> 34:21.434
They changed everyone's
drop points at the last minute,

34:22.060 --> 34:23.061
split us all up.

34:23.143 --> 34:25.563
- Lucky they didn't move us.
- That right?

34:27.315 --> 34:29.692
- What did you score?
- A fifth of my load.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.944
- And we still got a deal?
- Yeah.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.114
Sixty percent of our original cost.

34:35.197 --> 34:36.199
That's what we said.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.867
I know what the deal was, Alex.

34:37.949 --> 34:38.949
It's all there.

34:39.577 --> 34:40.577
<i>C'est beau.</i>

34:40.953 --> 34:43.998
Best part of the night
was you taking out Gabriel, by the way.

34:44.081 --> 34:47.168
Thanks for tipping me off about him.
He could have really hurt my operation.

34:47.793 --> 34:49.170
Goddamn rat...

34:49.837 --> 34:51.380
Snitching to the cops.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.341
So, now what?

34:54.550 --> 34:55.676
You saw what I did.

34:56.302 --> 34:57.845
I sent them back a witness.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.209
He's gonna tell them everything.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.766
He's gonna tell them
I took out one of your guys too,

35:01.849 --> 35:02.929
so you're gonna look clean.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.854
Hey, they're gonna come back to you.
You stay open to them.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.232
I need somebody to stay close with them.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.027
- All right. What about the Irish?
- What about 'em?

35:13.402 --> 35:15.154
- The Haitians?
- Who cares?

35:15.238 --> 35:17.907
They're gonna believe
you were planning to rip them off too.

35:17.990 --> 35:18.990
I'm just saying,

35:19.033 --> 35:21.327
you're not making any friends
with this play, Declan.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.787
I don't need any friends.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.121
I got guns.

35:26.582 --> 35:28.376
Everybody out. Let's go.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.045
Wait here.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.145
Tell them what happened.

35:49.021 --> 35:51.274
We went to the drop like we were told.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.276
It was just us and the bikers.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.194
And then bam.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.071
Someone started shooting.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.975
They blew away one of the bikers,

35:59.031 --> 36:01.659
then they killed one of my guys, Marco.
Me and Gino fired back,

36:01.742 --> 36:03.202
but they had machine guns.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.830
How did you get out?

36:07.665 --> 36:08.875
Declan let me go.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.294
To send you a message.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.548
He told me to tell you that, uh...

36:16.799 --> 36:17.884
he's coming for you.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.641
How many men did Declan have with him?

36:28.060 --> 36:29.060
I don't know.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.481
I saw maybe two or three.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.860
But there must have been more hiding.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.613
Who was shot first?

36:39.655 --> 36:41.407
The biker, then Marco.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.284
Did the bikers shoot back?

36:43.618 --> 36:45.258
Yeah. What is this, you don't believe me?

36:45.912 --> 36:47.622
- Domenic.
- I want you to take it easy.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.582
All right? We just wanna know
what happened.

36:49.665 --> 36:51.375
No one's questioning your loyalty here.

36:51.834 --> 36:52.834
Am I right?

36:55.671 --> 36:58.216
So, how did Declan know about the drop?

36:58.299 --> 37:01.099
Sounds like one of the gangs,
but that could've been anybody.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.554
You think the bikers were in on it?

37:03.638 --> 37:06.849
No, he was trying to kill them, too.

37:28.162 --> 37:29.538
I want you to find Declan.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.916
This needs to end.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.504
I want him dead.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.448
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

38:04.532 --> 38:05.658
How's it going, sunshine?

38:06.367 --> 38:07.785
<i>I'm... I'm good. I'm good.</i>

38:07.868 --> 38:10.746
- Uh, where are you?
- <i>Oh, I'm moving around.</i>

38:11.247 --> 38:12.999
- You got your meds?
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

38:13.082 --> 38:16.168
Um, your friend came
and left them at the front desk.

38:16.252 --> 38:19.005
So I got 'em. Easy. Thank you.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.300
Um, are you gonna come get me now?

38:23.759 --> 38:24.927
<i>Ready to go.</i>

38:25.678 --> 38:27.430
Hey, look, you gotta hold tight, okay?

38:27.513 --> 38:30.433
Yeah, but, like,
why don't you just come get me?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.351
I'll help you.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.228
<i>I don't wanna be here anymore.</i>

38:34.478 --> 38:35.479
You okay?

38:35.563 --> 38:37.356
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm totally cool.</i>

38:37.440 --> 38:40.443
It's just, um, you know, it'd be better

38:40.526 --> 38:42.570
if I was hanging with you again.

38:42.653 --> 38:43.988
<i>Reggie, tell me something.</i>

38:44.071 --> 38:46.490
In the woods, what happened?
What's going on with you?

38:46.574 --> 38:50.119
<i>I have, like, a condition.
I got a few of 'em, actually.</i>

38:50.202 --> 38:52.455
<i>I take my meds and that helps.</i>

38:52.538 --> 38:54.123
It's gotten a lot better.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.169
The gu... gunfire and shit didn't help.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.378
<i>I'm sure it didn't.</i>

39:00.004 --> 39:02.214
<i>Look, I'm gonna come get you soon.
I promise, all right?</i>

39:03.549 --> 39:04.383
Yeah.

39:04.467 --> 39:07.303
Hey, you got that parole meeting.
You can't miss it.

39:07.386 --> 39:09.180
You go and you get right back
to the hotel.

39:09.263 --> 39:10.514
You stay put. You got it?

39:10.931 --> 39:12.683
Yeah, got it.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.353
<i>What about you? Where are you staying?</i>

39:15.436 --> 39:18.898
Hey, I'm taking care of things.
It's gonna be okay. I'll see ya.

39:56.602 --> 39:57.602
Wes.

39:59.647 --> 40:00.647
Hey.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.566
You gotta go see your dad.

40:03.025 --> 40:04.568
Prison is a lonely place.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.362
He really misses you.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.116
The least you can do
is go see him once a month.

40:15.579 --> 40:16.664
Go inside.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.592
In the neighborhood?

40:29.009 --> 40:30.010
I'm, uh...

40:31.220 --> 40:34.306
I'm suddenly needing a place to stay,
Rose.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.351
No one's gonna look for me here.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.398
I'm not asking for something for nothing.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.988
Extra half percent on our deal.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.071
All right.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.784
You can stay
in that outbuilding over there.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.619
Thanks.

41:51.592 --> 41:52.843
Don't move, Declan.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.392
We have heard of your little problems.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.604
My employer sent me to remind you

42:03.687 --> 42:06.607
that our payment deadline
is still the same date.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.527
Jorge Ramirez does not listen to excuses.

42:09.985 --> 42:13.697
Not a day late, not an hour, not a minute.

42:14.156 --> 42:15.199
Understood.

42:15.866 --> 42:16.866
Good.

42:17.785 --> 42:18.785
Very good.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.788
I'll be around.

42:22.039 --> 42:25.000
Just to make sure
that you stick to our agreement.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.586
And if you don't,

42:28.712 --> 42:30.673
we're gonna be seeing each other soon.

42:31.799 --> 42:32.799
<i>Adios.</i>

42:56.615 --> 42:59.243
Yes, Domenic.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.870
<i>You wanted a war with Declan,
you got one.</i>

43:01.954 --> 43:04.957
<i>I just found your port contact's head
in my barbecue.</i>

43:07.543 --> 43:09.086
<i>Did you hear what I just said?</i>

43:09.545 --> 43:10.546
Yes.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.716
I will take care of this.

43:23.726 --> 43:24.935
Started looking for a job?

43:25.978 --> 43:26.979
What?

43:27.187 --> 43:29.315
- You started looking for a job?
- No, uh, not yet.

43:29.398 --> 43:30.524
I'm going to, though.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.794
All right. Keep a log
of every place you apply to, okay?

43:32.818 --> 43:35.029
Business name, address,
phone number, contact.

43:35.112 --> 43:36.780
- I'll be checking it.
- Okay.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.741
- Taking your meds?
- Yeah.

43:39.491 --> 43:41.702
Klonopin, Effexor, Norpramin?

43:41.785 --> 43:42.953
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm?

43:44.538 --> 43:47.666
All right, okay. Sign there.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.376
See me in four weeks.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.334
<i>Next time on </i> Bad Blood.

44:30.417 --> 44:34.004
Teresa and Christian, they kidnapped
someone very important to me.

44:34.088 --> 44:35.506
Now I have to stop them.

44:35.589 --> 44:38.258
Tell us where he is,
and all this can be over.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.385
Teresa and Christian?

44:39.468 --> 44:41.387
- Yeah.
- This is good work, Val.

44:41.470 --> 44:42.630
I'm not putting this gun down

44:42.680 --> 44:45.200
- until you tell me where Reggie is.
- Do what you think is right.

44:45.224 --> 44:48.435
What are we gonna do, shoot each other?
This is not what family does.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.562
You see what this animal is doing to us?

44:50.646 --> 44:52.773
I want this mess between us
to be over with.

44:52.856 --> 44:54.483
Until then, the torture continues.

44:54.566 --> 44:58.237
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna kill you and your brother,

44:58.320 --> 45:00.120
and then I'm gonna take
everything you've got.
