(Male announcer)
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.169 --> 00:04.337
Food service my ass!

00:04.404 --> 00:06.506
(Announcer)
After an embarrassing
opening-night dinner service...

00:06.573 --> 00:08.241
Not one entree has left
this kitchen.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.643
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay made the teams
go back to basics.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.812
I know I can cook meat.
(Announcer)
In the meat-grilling challenge--

00:12.880 --> 00:14.547
Don't do that.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.616
Back up off my arm, dawg.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.351
(Announcer)
Carrie and Elise didn't
impress Chef Ramsay.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.319
That's not medium-rare.
Not happy with that.

00:20.387 --> 00:22.155
(Announcer)
Or each other.

00:22.222 --> 00:23.589
Even just to look at her
makes me want to sock her.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.424
I just want to...Unh!

00:25.492 --> 00:27.593
(Announcer)
And will's perfectly
cooked meat...

00:27.661 --> 00:29.262
(Gordon)
You cooked the burger
medium-well. Beautiful.

00:29.329 --> 00:31.364
Bye-bye, girls.
Bye-bye.

00:31.431 --> 00:32.865
(Announcer)
Clinched the victory
for the men's team.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.634
Congratulations.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.302
(Announcer)
At dinner service...
Come on, ladies, let's go.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.637
(Announcer)
Carrie continued to struggle...

00:37.704 --> 00:39.172
Carrie...How can we be
backed up with a Caesar salad?

00:39.239 --> 00:41.107
(Announcer)
And Elise's big mouth...

00:41.175 --> 00:43.142
Let's go, ladies.
Ten minutes till the window.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.111
Ten minutes?
Ten seconds.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.046
(Announcer)
Got her in big trouble
with Chef Ramsay.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.681
Stop pointing at me
like I'm some picture!

00:48.749 --> 00:51.784
Thank you, Chef Ramsay,
for shutting up Elise.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.920
(Announcer)
In the blue kitchen...
<i>Where's the risotto?</i>

00:53.987 --> 00:55.121
(Announcer)
Chino screwed up the risotto...

00:55.189 --> 00:58.624
Another burnt risotto.
Burnt!

00:58.692 --> 01:00.593
(Announcer)
And Brendan...
Is that the same bass?

01:00.661 --> 01:01.994
No, Chef.
So where's the old one, then?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.563
Threw it away, Chef.
Show me.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.131
(Announcer)
Got caught in a lie.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.532
<i>I'm gonna ask you</i>
<i>one more time--</i>

01:06.600 --> 01:08.134
is that the bass
from ten minutes ago?

01:08.202 --> 01:09.735
Yes.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.304
(Announcer)
Which infuriated
Chef Ramsay so much...

01:11.371 --> 01:13.506
You, you, you, you, you...

01:13.574 --> 01:15.308
(Announcer)
That he kicked all of the men
out of the kitchen.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.276
Get the [bleep] out of here.
Get out!

01:17.344 --> 01:19.278
(Announcer)
The women completed
the blue team's orders...

01:19.346 --> 01:21.180
Ladies, well done.
Hell yeah!

01:21.248 --> 01:23.683
(Announcer)
And the men lost
their second dinner service

01:23.750 --> 01:25.851
in a row, and nominated...
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Brendan.</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:27.086
And...
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Chino, step forward.</i>

01:27.154 --> 01:29.021
I'm disappointed.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.957
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay ended the night
with an easy decision.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.825
Brendan, give me your
chef jacket.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.660
(Announcer)
Dashing Brendan's hopes
of being head chef

01:34.728 --> 01:36.762
at BLT Steak
in New York City.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.131
But Chef Ramsay wasn't done.

01:39.199 --> 01:42.134
Ladies, we've only seen men
leave the building.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.337
I need to hear
from a volunteer

01:44.404 --> 01:47.740
who will go
to the men's team.

And now, the continuation
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:55.282 --> 02:57.250
I didn't come out here
to be embarrassed, man.

02:57.317 --> 02:58.951
Monterray,
I agree with you, bro.

02:59.019 --> 03:00.586
It hurt my pride a little

03:00.654 --> 03:02.755
to have Chef Ramsay say
that he feels that us,

03:02.823 --> 03:04.657
as the blue team,
we needed some help.

03:04.725 --> 03:07.460
If we do succeed next shift
because another person

03:07.528 --> 03:08.995
<i>from another team came over,</i>

03:09.062 --> 03:10.396
that's the [bleep] thing
about it.

03:10.464 --> 03:13.933
Look, whoever comes,
she's part of our team.

03:14.001 --> 03:15.735
I have no problems
with anybody coming over.

03:15.802 --> 03:17.303
I'm tired of getting
my ass kicked.

03:17.371 --> 03:18.704
She's [bleep] blue,
she's blue.

03:22.409 --> 03:24.310
So what are we gonna do?

03:24.378 --> 03:26.812
I was thinking about it.
I'm tired of the drama.

03:26.880 --> 03:30.650
And I'm not saying that
you're drama or you're drama.

03:30.717 --> 03:34.554
But we all [bleep] know that
this combination right here--

03:34.621 --> 03:36.455
I can't stay in this dynamic
anymore.

03:36.523 --> 03:39.325
It Carrie and Elise
do not get split up,

03:39.393 --> 03:41.794
that will be the downfall
of the red team.

03:41.862 --> 03:43.396
I don't want to go,
and I'm not.

03:43.463 --> 03:45.364
You two not getting along
is an issue.

03:45.432 --> 03:46.966
<i>He said a volunteer.</i>

03:47.034 --> 03:48.734
<i>I really want to go.</i>

03:48.802 --> 03:51.437
I see it as an opportunity
for one of us to step up.

03:51.505 --> 03:53.873
I really want to go too.

03:53.941 --> 03:55.708
Damn, that really
takes away from our team.

03:55.776 --> 03:58.377
You two are very strong
in the kitchen.

03:58.445 --> 04:00.413
We're all competing
against each other anyway.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.914
You're either gonna prove
yourself, or you're not.

04:01.982 --> 04:03.783
Exactly.
I mean, seriously.

04:03.850 --> 04:06.152
I was thinking about it,
but I don't know.

04:06.219 --> 04:08.220
I have an idea.
If you want to go,

04:08.288 --> 04:10.323
then I won't go.

04:10.390 --> 04:12.191
If Jamie won't go...

04:12.259 --> 04:13.826
Now, are you behind me on that?
Yeah.

04:13.894 --> 04:15.861
I wanted to go
on the blue team,

04:15.929 --> 04:18.297
but everybody knows
that this was the best solution

04:18.365 --> 04:20.833
that could possibly happen.

04:20.901 --> 04:23.402
All right, it's easy. Done.
I volunteer.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.571
I just haven't had, really,
a chance to shine.

04:25.639 --> 04:27.673
And I think this is my time
to step up and do it.

04:27.741 --> 04:29.575
Plus, I enjoy working
with guys.

04:29.643 --> 04:32.278
I'm gonna come out
smelling like roses.

04:32.346 --> 04:33.646
<i>Carrie's going.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
Done.

04:37.651 --> 04:39.752
(Announcer)
With the big decision
behind them,

04:39.820 --> 04:42.888
the women and the men
settle into a peaceful slumber.

04:47.027 --> 04:49.595
But early
the next morning,

04:49.663 --> 04:51.998
Chef Ramsay has arranged
for a raucous slumber party.

04:52.065 --> 04:55.401
[Bicycle horns honking]

04:55.469 --> 04:57.837
Aah!

04:57.904 --> 05:00.072
I don't like clowns.
Clowns are freaky.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

05:01.775 --> 05:04.477
Shut the [bleep] up.
[Bleep].

05:04.544 --> 05:12.318
[Indistinct comments]

05:14.054 --> 05:15.655
That's the wrong way
to wake me up.

05:15.722 --> 05:17.523
Get the [...]
Out of here, bro.

05:17.591 --> 05:19.859
[Bicycle horns honking]

05:22.029 --> 05:23.929
Come on, quick.

05:23.997 --> 05:26.899
Chef Ramsay feels that since
you cook like a bunch of clowns,

05:26.967 --> 05:30.569
you might as well be woken up
by a bunch of clowns.

05:30.637 --> 05:32.471
Apparently, we're all
a bunch of clowns.

05:32.539 --> 05:36.075
A stunning metaphor.
My mind has been blown.

05:36.143 --> 05:39.045
Today, in the challenge, there's
a very special ingredient.

05:39.112 --> 05:42.214
Out front, there is a truck
full of Stonefire naan bread

05:42.282 --> 05:44.950
that needs to be unloaded
and brought in immediately.

05:45.018 --> 05:47.086
Okay? Let's go.
Everybody outside.

05:47.154 --> 05:49.355
<i>Okay, right inside.</i>
<i>Line 'em up in the kitchen.</i>

05:49.423 --> 05:51.791
I'm a sandwich guy. I love
Stonefire naan bread, dude.

05:51.858 --> 05:53.426
I'm curious to see what
we're gonna do

05:53.493 --> 05:57.963
with a crap-load
of naan bread.

05:58.031 --> 06:00.266
<i>Right. Good morning.</i>
All: Good morning, Chef.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.934
Look at all those
red jackets.

06:02.002 --> 06:04.036
<i>It's like an army there.</i>

06:04.104 --> 06:07.306
So, ladies,
who's volunteering?

06:07.374 --> 06:09.108
I am, Chef.

06:09.176 --> 06:12.011
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.

06:12.079 --> 06:14.280
The person joining
the blue team

06:14.347 --> 06:16.148
<i>will be Carrie.</i>

06:16.216 --> 06:17.683
It's not you.

06:17.751 --> 06:20.419
Natalie.
Yes, Chef.

06:20.487 --> 06:22.822
We just lost a good member
of our team.

06:22.889 --> 06:24.557
This sucks!

06:24.624 --> 06:26.892
This is awesome.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.395
For Chef Ramsay to pick me,

06:29.463 --> 06:32.198
that shows me that he knows
that I can step up.

06:32.265 --> 06:33.733
What do you think
you can bring to the blue team

06:33.800 --> 06:35.201
to make a difference?

06:35.268 --> 06:37.169
I was over in their kitchen
a little bit last night,

06:37.237 --> 06:38.938
and I think there's some
organizational skills lacking.

06:39.005 --> 06:42.742
Maybe we can pull together
and really make it happen.

06:42.809 --> 06:44.110
<i>Love the attitude.</i>
<i>Will,</i>

06:44.177 --> 06:45.911
you make it look painful.

06:45.979 --> 06:47.513
It's nothing personal
against any of the girls,

06:47.581 --> 06:49.181
but it sucks.
I've never had anyone

06:49.249 --> 06:51.851
say that to me before in my
entire career in the kitchen.

06:51.918 --> 06:53.285
To have that happen
in front of you,

06:53.353 --> 06:54.754
that's what hurts the most.

06:54.821 --> 06:57.990
I do not want anybody that
was not on our team originally

06:58.058 --> 07:00.226
on our team now.
But Chef Ramsay's gonna do

07:00.293 --> 07:01.494
what Chef Ramsay wants to do,
and the only thing we can do

07:01.561 --> 07:02.661
is roll with it.

07:02.729 --> 07:04.463
<i>Right, now...</i>

07:04.531 --> 07:06.265
I think our guests
are arriving.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.200
<i>They are very hungry.</i>

07:08.268 --> 07:09.335
You gotta be [bleep]
kidding me, bro.

07:09.402 --> 07:10.603
[Bleep].

07:10.670 --> 07:12.671
I don't do clowns, Chef.

07:12.739 --> 07:14.774
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Have a good look</i>
<i>behind the clowns,</i>

07:14.841 --> 07:16.375
<i>because today you'll be cooking</i>
<i>an extraordinary lunch</i>

07:16.443 --> 07:17.777
for children.

07:17.844 --> 07:20.045
Aw...
Oh...

07:20.113 --> 07:22.681
[Applause]
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Ladies, welcome.</i>

07:22.749 --> 07:24.717
This is your next challenge.

07:24.785 --> 07:27.486
When I seen the moms
and the kids coming in,

07:27.554 --> 07:29.388
I got that fire
inside of me.

07:29.456 --> 07:31.857
Because that's why I'm here,
for my four babies.

07:31.925 --> 07:33.592
I'm getting a little
teary-eyed now, you know.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.127
I definitely miss my babies.

07:35.195 --> 07:37.396
First team to feed
their diners

07:37.464 --> 07:38.931
wins the challenge.

07:38.999 --> 07:41.934
Let's get into the kitchens.
Let's go.

07:42.002 --> 07:44.103
(Announcer)
In today's mommy and me
challenge...

07:44.171 --> 07:45.871
Who's doing bechamel?
<i>Carrie is.</i>

07:45.939 --> 07:47.873
(Announcer)
The chefs must first serve pasta

07:47.941 --> 07:50.543
and chicken quesadillas
to 50 hungry children.

07:50.610 --> 07:53.012
I'll cook the chicken
if you can find some tortillas.

07:53.079 --> 07:54.847
(Announcer)
Once all the kids
have been served,

07:54.915 --> 07:56.549
the chefs must prepare
panini sandwiches

07:56.616 --> 07:59.952
for 50 mothers,
utilizing the naan bread

08:00.020 --> 08:01.987
from today's delivery.
We're gonna eat some food.

08:02.055 --> 08:03.455
(Announcer)
The first team to serve

08:03.523 --> 08:04.456
their side of the dining room

08:04.524 --> 08:05.691
wins the challenge.

08:05.759 --> 08:07.159
Are you hungry?
Well...

08:07.227 --> 08:09.061
They're gonna bring you
some food soon.

08:09.129 --> 08:11.163
Right, ladies, first order in.
Here we go.

08:11.231 --> 08:12.731
One quesadilla, one bowl
of pasta for the children.

08:12.799 --> 08:15.634
That goes first. Let's go.
All: Yes, Chef.

08:15.702 --> 08:17.703
Quesadillas. I need somebody
on quesadillas right now.

08:17.771 --> 08:19.839
Got it.

08:19.906 --> 08:22.474
I'm over losing challenges.
We have to win this one.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.643
Where are we going
with this?

08:24.711 --> 08:26.445
Blue team, here we go.
Away first,

08:26.513 --> 08:28.147
one quesadilla,
one bowl of pasta

08:28.215 --> 08:30.182
for the children.
All: Yes, Chef.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.518
Me, personally, I feel a lot
of pressure in this challenge.

08:32.586 --> 08:34.019
Because as a team, we suck.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.621
This is [bleep].
Pick it up!

08:35.688 --> 08:37.256
I feel like we need the win.

08:37.323 --> 08:39.258
Let's go, guys.
Bang it out.

08:39.326 --> 08:41.460
(Announcer)
Both teams are off
to a fast start.

08:41.528 --> 08:43.162
Quesadillas. Very hot.
Thank you.

08:43.230 --> 08:45.164
(Announcer)
And within 20 minutes,

08:45.232 --> 08:48.434
each kitchen has fed half
of their hungry children.

08:48.501 --> 08:50.769
Convection oven's on.
I'm gonna put it in now?

08:50.837 --> 08:54.406
Yeah.
Can I flip it?

08:54.474 --> 08:55.741
Do you want to get
a new one started?

08:55.809 --> 08:58.911
You think that's okay?

08:58.979 --> 09:01.580
I can't believe Jamie's
going to serve

09:01.648 --> 09:02.982
a burned quesadilla.

09:03.049 --> 09:04.550
It's not gonna be good.

09:04.618 --> 09:08.554
Where's the quesadilla?
It's burnt.

09:08.622 --> 09:10.055
They're children!
Ladies!

09:10.123 --> 09:14.026
Ladies, come here!
All of you!

09:14.094 --> 09:15.661
Would you serve that
to your baby?

09:15.729 --> 09:16.929
No, Chef.
<i>No, Chef.</i>

09:16.997 --> 09:17.863
Unbelievable.

09:19.699 --> 09:23.035
Jamie, stop sulking
like a [bleep] baby!

09:23.103 --> 09:24.837
The babies are out there,
not in here!

09:24.905 --> 09:27.306
Start again.
[Bleep] [Bleep].

09:27.374 --> 09:29.375
(Announcer)
While Jamie is making
her little diners wait...

09:29.442 --> 09:32.011
[Crying]
You hungry? I'm starving.

09:32.078 --> 09:33.779
(Announcer)
In the blue kitchen,
Natalie is determined

09:33.847 --> 09:35.347
to push her new team ahead...

09:35.415 --> 09:36.882
I've got two more
coming at you, Will.

09:36.950 --> 09:37.716
(Announcer)
And get out the last

09:37.784 --> 09:39.084
of their kids' plates.

09:39.152 --> 09:41.553
What's your time
on the chicken, Monterray?

09:41.621 --> 09:43.555
Chicken is in. Two minutes.
2 1/2 at the most.
<i>How about pasta?</i>

09:43.623 --> 09:45.057
Natalie, give me four--
four minutes.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.760
Four minutes, guys.
<i>Nice job, Natalie.</i>

09:47.827 --> 09:49.795
Okay, I've got you
on quesadillas.

09:49.863 --> 09:51.130
We finally [bleep]
Started communicating.

09:51.197 --> 09:52.498
And you know why?

09:52.565 --> 09:54.066
Because we got Natalie
over on the team.

09:54.134 --> 09:55.434
How are we looking, guys?
How long?

09:55.502 --> 09:58.871
Chef Ramsay knows
what he's doing 100%, man.

09:58.939 --> 10:00.539
You got peppers
on there yet?
Yes.

10:00.607 --> 10:02.107
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Service, please.</i>

10:02.175 --> 10:03.509
Last quesadilla.
Did we get the panini?

10:03.576 --> 10:04.677
Yes, Chef.

10:04.744 --> 10:06.912
Last quesadilla, guys.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.048
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Go. Table two. Let's go.</i>

10:09.115 --> 10:10.683
(Announcer)
30 minutes into the mommy and me
challenge,

10:10.750 --> 10:12.718
the teams
are virtually tied,

10:12.786 --> 10:14.753
having served all of the
children in the dining room.

10:14.821 --> 10:16.522
Three chicken panini,
one ham,

10:16.589 --> 10:18.457
three sweet potato
fries.
Yes, Chef

10:18.525 --> 10:20.726
(announcer)
Now the race is on
to get the mothers fed.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.328
We need three chickens,
one ham--let's go.

10:22.395 --> 10:24.096
Here. We need some
over here.

10:24.164 --> 10:26.165
We can't be keep crossing over
each other, Carrie.

10:26.232 --> 10:27.666
You're running around
frazzled.

10:27.734 --> 10:28.934
I'm not running around
frazzled.

10:29.002 --> 10:30.069
I'm trying to get
this [bleep] done.

10:30.136 --> 10:31.236
We already been assigned
paninis.

10:31.304 --> 10:33.138
I'm doing the chicken,
Carrie.

10:33.206 --> 10:35.107
You can cut. You can cut.
We need to be organized.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.509
I consider Elise like
a little yip-yip dog.

10:37.577 --> 10:39.645
She just kind of <i>bip bip bip</i>
<i>bip bip bip</i> at your feet,

10:39.713 --> 10:40.779
and you just kind of
kick her away, you know.

10:40.847 --> 10:42.081
<i>How 'bout I'll cut it</i>
<i>over here?</i>

10:42.148 --> 10:43.816
She's not [bleep] listening.
<i>How's that?</i>

10:43.883 --> 10:45.317
How 'bout I cut it over here?
<i>The girl's not listening.</i>

10:45.385 --> 10:46.685
I'm trying to get
the [bleep] done.

10:46.753 --> 10:48.620
I'm frustrated with Carrie.
I hate her.

10:48.688 --> 10:50.122
She runs around the kitchen

10:50.190 --> 10:51.590
like a chicken
with her head cut off.

10:51.658 --> 10:53.359
[Panting]

10:53.426 --> 10:55.294
Breathing and all that.
Nobody needs that.

10:55.362 --> 10:57.529
Looks like there's
[bleep] missing.

10:57.597 --> 10:59.631
This is not--
Carrie made this one.
That's the one I made.

10:59.699 --> 11:00.199
I did not.
Carrie made that one.
Get rid of that [bleep].

11:00.266 --> 11:01.667
Excuse me.

11:01.735 --> 11:03.002
Elise, I made that one right
there and I set it right there.

11:03.069 --> 11:04.603
Get away from me, Carrie!

11:04.671 --> 11:06.538
(Announcer)
While the red team
wastes time arguing...

11:06.606 --> 11:08.374
I need a ham on the fly!
I need a ham yesterday!

11:08.441 --> 11:10.342
I'm making it now.
Thank you.

11:10.410 --> 11:12.311
Two chicken, one ham,
one veg.

11:12.379 --> 11:13.145
(Announcer)
The blue team's
newfound chemistry

11:13.213 --> 11:14.813
is paying off.

11:14.881 --> 11:16.749
(Natalie)
Let's go, guys.
We're kicking ass.

11:16.816 --> 11:18.017
(Announcer)
And they now have the lead.

11:18.084 --> 11:19.718
You've got a very small lead.
Keep it going.

11:19.786 --> 11:22.087
Yes, Chef. Go!
Slide 'em up there.

11:22.155 --> 11:24.757
Service, please. Table one.
<i>Table one. Thank you.</i>

11:24.824 --> 11:27.092
Ladies, the guys
are flying out now.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.627
Come on!
Chicken!

11:28.695 --> 11:30.029
(Will)
It's like a back and forth
battle

11:30.096 --> 11:30.863
with us and the red team.

11:30.930 --> 11:32.531
We're so close right now.

11:32.599 --> 11:34.700
We gotta pick up the pace.
Let's do this!

11:34.768 --> 11:36.068
Two tables left.
Let's go.

11:36.136 --> 11:38.203
Right now.
Excuse me, Chef.

11:38.271 --> 11:40.606
Unbelievable.

11:40.673 --> 11:42.808
All of you, just stop.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.677
Look at me!
Look at me!

(Announcer)
For Chef Ramsay's
teamwork challenge,

11:57.036 --> 11:58.937
the chefs are cooking lunch
for a dining room

11:59.004 --> 12:01.506
full of hungry children
and their mothers.

12:01.574 --> 12:03.341
The blue team has got
two tickets left, ladies.

12:03.409 --> 12:05.109
<i>You've got three.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

12:05.177 --> 12:06.878
(Announcer)
And both teams
are racing to the finish.

12:06.946 --> 12:08.279
Excuse me, Chef.

12:08.347 --> 12:09.447
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>All of you, just stop!</i>

12:09.515 --> 12:10.848
Look at me.
Look at me!

12:10.916 --> 12:12.750
There's no chicken in here.

12:12.818 --> 12:14.586
<i>I mean, do you think</i>
<i>I'm gonna push that out?</i>

12:14.653 --> 12:16.487
You've got a small lead,
but it's shrinking away.

12:16.555 --> 12:18.823
Start the table again!
All: Yes, Chef.

12:18.891 --> 12:20.458
Guys, use every single
little bit of chicken we have.

12:20.526 --> 12:22.160
A nice, even layer, man.

12:22.228 --> 12:23.861
Oh, man,
that burned my ass, man.

12:23.929 --> 12:25.129
I need the paninis.

12:25.197 --> 12:26.998
30 seconds to the window.

12:27.066 --> 12:29.167
You're griddling paninis,
you know what I'm saying?

12:29.235 --> 12:30.702
It ain't rocket science.
Good luck. Good luck, guys.

12:30.769 --> 12:32.403
Come on, we're so close, I'd
like to take it away from them.

12:32.471 --> 12:34.372
Table four. Quickly.
There we go.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.940

<i>Send the chicken.</i>

<i>Let's go!</i>
Guys, pick it up!

Come on, come on, come on.
<i>Fast, fast, fast.</i>

12:42.548 --> 12:43.848
Talk to each other.
Talk to each other.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.016
They're on their
last ticket,

12:45.084 --> 12:47.218
and so are you.
Come on, come on, Carrie.

12:47.286 --> 12:48.586
I've got a veggie
right here, Chef.

12:48.654 --> 12:49.587
Is that it?
Go.

12:49.655 --> 12:51.089
Service, please.

12:51.156 --> 12:53.224
Blue team,
congratulations

12:53.292 --> 12:58.229
[blue team cheering]

12:59.732 --> 13:01.933
I really wanted to go
to the blue team.

13:02.001 --> 13:03.501
I really did.

13:03.569 --> 13:05.937
That was the first time
we actually communicated, bro.

13:06.005 --> 13:09.073
Welcome aboard, baby!
Welcome.

13:09.141 --> 13:11.376
One, two, three...
All: Blue!

13:11.443 --> 13:13.177
Credit's given
where credit's deserved.

13:13.245 --> 13:14.312
Natalie came in--
she's a rock star.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.314
Natalie, that's awesome.

13:16.382 --> 13:18.082
It's what I do, boys.

13:18.150 --> 13:20.551
We need to come back
together as a team.

13:20.619 --> 13:22.754
(Elise)
At the same time we have to
look at our weakest links too

13:22.821 --> 13:24.756
because that's gonna cause us
problems at dinner service.

13:24.823 --> 13:27.091
Why are you in my space?

13:27.159 --> 13:29.227
I'm not in your space.
Back up.
You're in my space.

13:29.295 --> 13:30.962
This is my personal space.
I'm like a foot away.

13:31.030 --> 13:32.430
Your mouth is one
of the issues, Carrie.

13:32.498 --> 13:34.132
You following people around
and walking around doing [bleep]

13:34.199 --> 13:35.933
Is one of
the weakest issues.

13:36.001 --> 13:37.635
Jamie, I thought
I was actually helping out.

13:37.703 --> 13:39.637
No. Find a station
and man it!

13:39.705 --> 13:40.705
All right.
All right, fine.
<i>That's it.</i>

13:44.977 --> 13:47.312

Guys, line up. Let's go.
All: Yes, Chef.

13:47.379 --> 13:51.616
Okay...Blue team,
job well done.

13:51.684 --> 13:53.818
You know, if I'd have known
it was that easy

13:53.886 --> 13:57.088
to bring a beautiful lady in
to get everybody talking,

13:57.156 --> 13:58.823
<i>I'd have had Tommy</i>
<i>put a dress on, man.</i>

13:58.891 --> 14:01.526

14:01.593 --> 14:03.995
Okay, today you're gonna have
a lot of surprises.

14:04.063 --> 14:05.997
I don't want to give it away now
in front of the girls.

14:06.065 --> 14:08.232
It would be unfair.
So run upstairs

14:08.300 --> 14:09.867
and change into something
a little bit more comfortable.

14:09.935 --> 14:11.436
Okay? Get out of there.

14:11.503 --> 14:14.205

14:14.273 --> 14:16.574

that spirit go?

14:16.642 --> 14:18.242
How can you lose it?

14:18.310 --> 14:20.978
Is it because you lost
your lucky charm in Natalie?

14:21.046 --> 14:22.647
All: No, Chef.

14:22.715 --> 14:24.615
I will say, Chef,
I feel like Carrie

14:24.683 --> 14:26.217
ran around the kitchen today

14:26.285 --> 14:28.286
like a chicken
with her head cut off...

14:28.354 --> 14:30.188
Oh, my God.
And didn't know where she
should go, what she should do.

14:30.255 --> 14:31.756
'Cause we were neck and neck,
and we could have

14:31.824 --> 14:33.291
won this challenge easily
with our eyes closed.

14:33.359 --> 14:35.426
I was trying to, like,
get everything out.

14:35.494 --> 14:37.161
<i>I was doing everything I can</i>

14:37.229 --> 14:38.696
<i>because I want to make it</i>
<i>perfect.</i>

14:38.764 --> 14:40.465
I wouldn't send out
a half-assed sandwich

14:40.532 --> 14:42.367
or anything like that.
It's just like she's--

14:42.434 --> 14:44.068
both of you need to shut up.
That's what needs to happen.

14:44.136 --> 14:46.404
Stop. Shut your mouths.
Both of you.

14:46.472 --> 14:48.373
<i>(Jamie)</i>
<i>Stop talking.</i>
Unbelievable.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.475
<i>Carrie--all right.</i>
Okay, just leave it.

14:50.542 --> 14:53.077
Okay, you're gonna be spending
a little time together today

14:53.145 --> 14:55.346
<i>figuring it out.</i>
<i>First of all,</i>

14:55.414 --> 14:59.016
look at the state
of my dining room.

14:59.084 --> 15:02.053
<i>What a mess. Ugh.</i>

15:02.121 --> 15:05.056
I want my dining room
pristine.

15:05.124 --> 15:07.759
<i>Ready. Off you go.</i>
All: Yes, Chef.

15:07.826 --> 15:09.260
God, this is a disaster.

15:09.328 --> 15:10.928
Like, how did I end up
with this team

15:10.996 --> 15:12.530
that can't put
their differences aside

15:12.598 --> 15:14.365
when it's all of our asses
on the line?

15:18.070 --> 15:20.571
<i>Kids are disgusting.</i>
Kids are nasty.

15:20.639 --> 15:22.206
Gross.

15:22.274 --> 15:24.509
The restaurant
was disgusting.

15:24.576 --> 15:26.711
I can't understand how kids
can be that messy.

15:26.779 --> 15:28.513
My son is three years old
and was never that messy.

15:28.580 --> 15:32.283
[Vacuum rattling]

15:32.351 --> 15:33.985
There's something
in the vacuum.

[Turns off vacuum]

15:35.621 --> 15:38.122
I don't know how
this [bleep] thing works.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.425
Carrie is worse
than useless.

15:40.492 --> 15:42.059
Something not up here.

15:42.127 --> 15:45.129
<i>You broke the vacuum.</i>
[bleep] dang it.

15:45.197 --> 15:46.931
I feel a little bad for Carrie.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.966
Everybody's got this
tainted image of her.

15:49.034 --> 15:50.268

15:50.335 --> 15:53.037
And once you get somebody
in your radar,

15:53.105 --> 15:56.107
every single thing that they do
you're gonna criticize.

15:56.175 --> 15:58.843
It never fails.
[Vacuum rattling]

15:58.911 --> 16:00.445
I don't like punishment.

16:00.512 --> 16:01.779
(Announcer)
While most of the red team

16:01.847 --> 16:03.214
goes medieval on Carrie...

16:03.282 --> 16:05.683
Whoo!

16:05.751 --> 16:08.052
(Announcer)
The blue team is in
for some medieval fun.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.655
Welcome to the splendors
of Medieval Times.

16:10.722 --> 16:13.324
Yeah! All right.

16:13.392 --> 16:14.292
[Neighing]

16:14.359 --> 16:15.860
Medieval Times.

16:15.928 --> 16:17.562
Oh, my God.

16:17.629 --> 16:19.664
It's getting to sit and eat
a big-ass turkey leg

16:19.731 --> 16:22.533
and watch people fight.

16:22.601 --> 16:25.636
[Cheering]

16:25.704 --> 16:28.306
Stab him in the heart!
Go, blue knight!

16:28.373 --> 16:30.641
Don't take that [bleep]
from him, kick his ass!

16:30.709 --> 16:33.678
Uhh!
Yeah!

16:33.745 --> 16:34.846
Haaaa!

16:34.913 --> 16:36.981
Oh...

16:37.049 --> 16:38.416
Yeah!

16:38.484 --> 16:40.351
I'm a kitchen warrior.
I got my battle-ax,

16:40.419 --> 16:42.019
I got my--my shield.

16:42.087 --> 16:43.788
Like, I'm really, really
enjoying myself today.

16:43.856 --> 16:45.990
Yeah, blue knight!

16:46.058 --> 16:47.625
It just keeps getting better.

16:47.693 --> 16:49.927
We not only got to watch
a sword fight,

16:49.995 --> 16:51.863
but we got to
do it ourselves, man.

16:51.930 --> 16:53.731
Point your sword out in front
of you, just like this.

16:53.799 --> 16:55.933
(Jonathon)
That [bleep] was cool.

16:56.001 --> 17:00.738
I mean, there was literally
[bleep] sparks flying.

17:00.806 --> 17:04.008
(Announcer)
As the blue team's reward gets
better and better,

17:04.076 --> 17:06.077
the red team learns
that their punishment

17:06.144 --> 17:07.712
is not just limited
to cleaning.

17:07.779 --> 17:09.814
I'm sick of this crap.

17:09.882 --> 17:11.915
(Announcer)
It also includes setting up
for family night,

17:11.983 --> 17:13.284
which is tomorrow night
at Hell's Kitchen.

17:13.352 --> 17:15.819
Oh...
(Elise)
Great.

17:15.887 --> 17:17.755
We're going to be
assembling a playground.

17:17.823 --> 17:20.023
Another team-building
exercise, ladies.

17:20.092 --> 17:24.194
Good job.

17:24.262 --> 17:27.064
And of course,
Carrie the mouth was, like,

17:27.132 --> 17:30.101
"uh..."
[Speaking gibberish]

17:30.168 --> 17:32.169
You think a couple of us
should get started on that?

17:32.237 --> 17:34.272
Yeah, can we do that?
Come on, Elizabeth.

17:34.339 --> 17:36.140
I thought the best thing to do
was put together

17:36.208 --> 17:38.976
the biggest project--
the swing set.

17:39.044 --> 17:41.045
Push forward.
But for some reason,

17:41.113 --> 17:42.980
Krupa, Elizabeth,
and Carrie

17:43.048 --> 17:44.515
put together
the basketball net,

17:44.583 --> 17:47.018
which is, like,
three pieces.

17:47.085 --> 17:49.153
Turn that way.
All right.

17:49.221 --> 17:51.255
Pull.
[Exasperated sigh]

17:51.323 --> 17:54.191
It is really stuck good.
How'd we get it stuck so good?

18:00.766 --> 18:02.934
Ha, ha, ha!

18:03.001 --> 18:07.738
[Laughter]

18:07.806 --> 18:11.709
Victory for the blue team!

18:11.777 --> 18:13.611
When the wenches are finished
with the day's work,

18:13.679 --> 18:15.179
please bring me
a flagon of mead.

18:15.247 --> 18:17.281
Them acting like fools,
I wanted to turn around

18:17.349 --> 18:18.883
and swing at one of them.

18:18.951 --> 18:20.418
<i>What are y'all ladies</i>
<i>building?</i>

18:20.485 --> 18:23.187
Do we get to play
with this later?
No.

18:23.255 --> 18:25.523
That's a lot of instructions
for a slide.

18:25.591 --> 18:27.625
<i>Ladies, enjoy building stuff.</i>

18:27.693 --> 18:29.260
We shall go
be drunk and merry.

18:29.328 --> 18:32.597
[Laughter]

18:32.664 --> 18:34.865
(Announcer)
After a long day of pleasure
for the blue team

18:34.933 --> 18:36.634
and pain for the red,

18:36.702 --> 18:38.636
the teams settle in
to discuss their plan

18:38.704 --> 18:40.471
for the next dinner service.

18:40.539 --> 18:42.006
Natalie, what do you want
to bring to the table

18:42.074 --> 18:43.407
that's gonna help up
win this service,

18:43.475 --> 18:44.108
based on what
you guys did?

18:44.176 --> 18:45.910
Give us the scoop.

18:45.978 --> 18:48.279
The reason why we did dinner
service so good the other night

18:48.347 --> 18:50.848
is because we had everything
set up on point.

18:50.916 --> 18:52.216
Yeah.

18:52.284 --> 18:55.753
We would make out lists
for every station.

18:55.821 --> 18:58.656
I'm taking all the advice
I can get

18:58.724 --> 19:00.291
from Natalie right now,
you know,

19:00.359 --> 19:02.860
because she was
with the red team.

19:02.928 --> 19:06.597
They [bleep] blasted us out
in the past two dinner services.

19:06.665 --> 19:08.232
If we set up the stations

19:08.300 --> 19:11.068
and we keep a constant
communication,

19:11.136 --> 19:12.770
that's all we need to do.

19:12.838 --> 19:14.105
(Announcer)
While the blue team works out

19:14.172 --> 19:15.873
their plan of action,

19:15.941 --> 19:18.242
the red team is hatching
a strategic plan of their own.

19:18.310 --> 19:20.011
Think about it logically.

19:20.078 --> 19:21.779
What are we gonna do with Carrie
doing dinner service?

19:21.847 --> 19:24.181
Especially if she's assigned
to a hardcore station.

19:24.249 --> 19:25.549
Help me come up
with a solution.

19:25.617 --> 19:27.251
<i>I don't know.</i>

19:27.319 --> 19:29.320
<i>That's the only thing--</i>
<i>that's--I don't know.</i>

19:29.388 --> 19:31.389
<i>What did she do today?</i>
<i>She made bechamel sauce.</i>

19:31.456 --> 19:33.257
Not even made it
from scratch.

19:33.325 --> 19:34.458
<i>What else?</i>
All right,
good point.

19:34.526 --> 19:37.461
You want to know
what I did?

19:37.529 --> 19:39.397
<i>Yes, I heated up</i>
<i>the bechamel sauce.</i>

19:39.464 --> 19:40.731
Then I went over and I
helped you with the quesadillas

19:40.799 --> 19:42.633
'cause that would
get things done faster.

19:42.701 --> 19:44.235
Why do you have
an attitude with me?

19:44.302 --> 19:44.802
I don't have an attitude
with you.

19:44.870 --> 19:46.637
I'm just--God!

19:46.705 --> 19:48.406
<i>Stop with the attitude.</i>

19:48.473 --> 19:50.074
I don't have an attitude.
I was giving you attitude,

19:50.142 --> 19:52.810
and you were--
excuse me.

19:52.878 --> 19:55.446
I didn't even say anything.
They said it!
Did you not pop off--

19:55.514 --> 19:59.116
they said, "What did she do?"
<i>They</i> said it!

20:04.508 --> 20:05.708
Excuse me.

20:05.776 --> 20:07.343
(Announcer)
At the end of a long

20:07.411 --> 20:08.544
and punishing day
for the red team...

20:08.612 --> 20:10.947
<i>They</i> said,
"What did she do?"

20:11.015 --> 20:14.050
(Announcer)
Jamie's irritation with Carrie
has reached a boiling point.

20:14.118 --> 20:15.685
I didn't say
a [bleep] word.

20:15.753 --> 20:17.453
You popped off and said
I put onions in it.

20:17.521 --> 20:18.621
So you shouldn't be
giving me any attitude.

20:18.689 --> 20:22.225
[Bleep] damn it, Jamie.

20:22.293 --> 20:25.361
Carrie is creating
all these problems,

20:25.429 --> 20:27.230
and that's what's fracturing
the team.

20:27.298 --> 20:29.065
If she can't get it together,
we're screwed.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.334
This is going to be a problem.
She's got something wrong.

20:31.402 --> 20:32.869
Pppbbbt.

20:40.010 --> 20:42.578
(Announcer)
Tonight is family night
in Hell's Kitchen.

20:42.646 --> 20:44.747
Meat's doing good
over here, guys.

20:44.815 --> 20:46.683
(Announcer)
And while the red team
is hoping to repeat

20:46.750 --> 20:48.451
their successful last dinner
service in Hell's Kitchen,

20:48.519 --> 20:50.753
the blue team is hoping
to claim victory

20:50.821 --> 20:53.890
like they did yesterday
in the mommy and me lunch.

20:53.957 --> 20:56.225
<i>These garlic</i>
<i>and shallots are done.</i>

20:56.293 --> 20:58.795
Prep is going very smooth.
Everyone's in sync.

20:58.862 --> 21:02.365
That's the number one step
to victory, boys.

21:02.433 --> 21:03.866
(Announcer)
While the blue team's
communication

21:03.934 --> 21:05.902
has reached a new high,

21:05.969 --> 21:07.670
the red team's communication.

21:07.738 --> 21:09.439
Who needs confit garlic?

21:12.042 --> 21:15.011
(Announcer)
Has hit a new low.

21:15.079 --> 21:17.046
(Krupa)
Prep seems to be going good.

21:17.114 --> 21:18.648
The red team is not fighting.

21:18.716 --> 21:21.984
Anybody?

21:22.052 --> 21:24.854
I mean, what better way
to avoid a drama

21:24.922 --> 21:27.190
than not talking?
No?

21:31.061 --> 21:32.695
(Announcer)
The most popular night

21:32.763 --> 21:33.930
in Hell's Kitchen
is family night.

21:33.997 --> 21:36.466
Are you clear on
what you're doing tonight?

21:36.533 --> 21:38.668
(Announcer)
To ensure that this
hectic evening runs smoothly,

21:38.736 --> 21:41.170
Chef Ramsay has dispatched
Chino and Gina

21:41.238 --> 21:42.472
to assist James
in the dining room.

21:42.539 --> 21:44.907
James, Gina, and Chino,

21:44.975 --> 21:46.709
open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Yes, Chef.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

21:55.252 --> 21:56.085
You're right here,
ladies.

21:59.957 --> 22:01.724
(Announcer)
For tonight's dinner service,

22:01.792 --> 22:03.760
in addition
to the regular menu,

22:03.827 --> 22:05.661
Chef Ramsay has added
a kids' menu

22:05.729 --> 22:09.298
that includes chicken tenders,
burgers, and spaghetti.

22:09.366 --> 22:10.767
Chicken fingers?

22:10.834 --> 22:12.635
Spaghetti? Okay.
I've got three entrees.

22:12.703 --> 22:14.337
(Announcer)
Each table will also be served

22:14.405 --> 22:15.938
a welcoming
margherita pizza.

22:16.006 --> 22:19.409
Order in.
Order in.

22:19.476 --> 22:21.477
So what does that say there?
Help me understand that.

22:21.545 --> 22:23.646
It's a margherita.
One chicken tender,

22:23.714 --> 22:25.615
one beef Wellington,
and what's that?

22:25.682 --> 22:27.617
Kid cheeseburger.

22:27.684 --> 22:30.353
And no sides?
Did you offer them sides?

22:30.421 --> 22:31.921
Uh, no, I didn't, Chef.

22:31.989 --> 22:34.757
Oh, piss off, Chino!

22:36.860 --> 22:38.127
Chef Ramsay was busting
my [bleep]

22:38.195 --> 22:40.696
For not writing legibly.

22:40.764 --> 22:42.298
And I don't know.

22:42.366 --> 22:45.802
I'm completely
discombobulated.

22:45.869 --> 22:47.203
Here you are, Chef.

22:47.271 --> 22:48.805
Two appetizers,
three entrees.

22:48.872 --> 22:51.407
Is that right?
Yes, Chef.

22:51.475 --> 22:53.376
<i>Very nice.</i>
<i>Red team, we're off.</i>

22:53.444 --> 22:55.111
Two risotto,
one Caesar salad, one cioppini.

22:55.179 --> 22:56.512
Yes, Chef.
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

22:56.580 --> 22:57.880
I'm gonna do the best
that I can.

22:57.948 --> 22:59.415
I'm on my "a" game,

22:59.483 --> 23:01.350
and I can get us off
to a racing start.

23:01.418 --> 23:03.553
Check the bottom.
Good. Salad please.

23:03.620 --> 23:05.922
Nice pizza, Elise.
Thank you, Chef.

23:05.989 --> 23:08.691
Margherita pizza away.
Table 30, please.

23:08.759 --> 23:10.092
(Announcer)
While Elise gets the red team

23:10.160 --> 23:11.594
off to a good start,

23:11.662 --> 23:13.362
the blue kitchen
is still waiting for Chino

23:13.430 --> 23:14.964
to deliver an order.

23:15.032 --> 23:16.799
Chino.

23:16.867 --> 23:18.835
<i>Chino.</i>

23:18.902 --> 23:19.869
[Yelling]
Chino!

23:22.239 --> 23:24.674
Chino, let's go.
Time's of the essence,

23:24.741 --> 23:26.542
so it's go time.
Gotta go. Gotta go.

23:26.610 --> 23:28.878
Ticket for 21--
chicken tenders, squab salad.

23:28.946 --> 23:30.680
Entree--
beef Wellington.

23:30.747 --> 23:33.216
Holy crap. Finally,
he's written the ticket out.

23:33.283 --> 23:35.852
<i>All right, blue team,</i>
<i>margherita pizza.</i>

23:35.919 --> 23:37.954
One chicken tender,
one squab salad.

23:38.021 --> 23:38.988
Entree--one beef Wellington,
one spaghetti for the children.

23:39.056 --> 23:40.490
All: Yes, Chef.

23:40.557 --> 23:42.692
Give me a time
on that first margherita.

23:42.759 --> 23:44.494
Two minutes, Chef.
Good. Let's go.

23:44.561 --> 23:46.229
(Announcer)
As jonathon gets the blue team's

23:46.296 --> 23:49.465
first pizza going,
in the red kitchen,

23:49.533 --> 23:51.334
Krupa's ready to deliver
her first appetizer.

23:51.401 --> 23:52.668
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Risotto, where is it?</i>

23:52.736 --> 23:54.437
Krupa.
Yes, Chef.

23:54.505 --> 23:56.739
All right, I'm walking with
the risotto. You guys ready?

23:56.807 --> 23:59.141
Yeah.
I need that squid asap!

23:59.209 --> 24:01.544
Blue team, you may be winning
every [bleep] Challenge

24:01.612 --> 24:05.248
that comes along, but we're
winning the important stuff.

24:05.315 --> 24:06.716
Who made that risotto?

24:06.783 --> 24:08.251
I did. Thank you, Chef.
It's delicious.

24:08.318 --> 24:10.820
Yeah, we're gonna
kick ass tonight!

24:10.888 --> 24:12.288
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

24:12.356 --> 24:14.290
<i>Amanda!</i>

24:14.358 --> 24:16.859
What is going on
over there?

24:16.927 --> 24:18.995
<i>Elise.</i>
Yes, Chef.

24:19.062 --> 24:20.530
I knocked over
the sauce.

24:20.597 --> 24:22.265
Amanda is very frazzled.

24:22.332 --> 24:24.367
It is super frustrating to me

24:24.434 --> 24:25.668
because I'm really sick,
at this point,

24:25.736 --> 24:27.436
of babysitting people.

24:27.504 --> 24:29.305
Oh, my gosh.

24:29.373 --> 24:31.307
[Hissing]

24:31.375 --> 24:32.341
(Announcer)
45 minutes

24:32.409 --> 24:34.443
into dinner service...

24:34.511 --> 24:35.978
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Service, please.</i>

24:36.046 --> 24:36.712
(Announcer)
Appetizers are flying

24:36.780 --> 24:38.147
out of the red kitchen.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.216
And the blue kitchen is
looking to Tommy...

24:40.284 --> 24:41.784
Two chicken tenders.

24:41.852 --> 24:43.553
(Announcer)
To get them off the ground.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.087
Chicken finger,
are you up or no?

24:45.155 --> 24:47.123
Good. Bring 'em.
Are they burnt?

24:47.190 --> 24:48.858
They're burnt,
bro.
[Bleep].

24:48.926 --> 24:50.059
<i>More chicken fingers</i>
<i>down now.</i>

24:50.127 --> 24:50.960
Two chicken tenders.

24:51.028 --> 24:52.662
You think that's burnt?

24:52.729 --> 24:54.463
You wanna serve it, bro,
you [bleep] Bring it to him.

24:54.531 --> 24:56.165
Guys, I'm dying here.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.600
<i>Tommy!</i>

24:57.668 --> 25:00.202
Two tenders, Chef.

25:00.270 --> 25:02.705
They're overcooked
and they're [bleep] Dry.

25:02.773 --> 25:06.442
Tommy, come here.
Come here!

25:06.510 --> 25:07.877
I know they're children,
all right.

25:07.945 --> 25:09.412
<i>I've got four of my own.</i>

25:09.479 --> 25:11.447
Would you serve them
that [bleep]?

25:11.515 --> 25:13.749
It's like a [bleep]
Baby's flip-flop!

25:13.817 --> 25:15.117
Oh, piss off,
will you!

25:15.185 --> 25:15.751
Come on,
quality product, Tommy.

25:15.819 --> 25:17.153
Piss off.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.021
(Announcer)
While Tommy's overcooked tenders

25:19.089 --> 25:20.256
keep families
on the blue side waiting...

25:20.324 --> 25:22.959
Where's my food?
Where's my food?

25:23.026 --> 25:24.894
(Announcer)
The red team,
led by Krupa and Jamie,

25:24.962 --> 25:26.462
has completed
their appetizers,

25:26.530 --> 25:28.898
and Chef Ramsay is looking
to Carrie and Jennifer

25:28.966 --> 25:31.000
to keep the momentum going
with the entrees.

25:31.068 --> 25:33.569
Okay, first entree.
Two sea bass, one lamb,

25:33.637 --> 25:35.237
<i>two New York strip,</i>
<i>one cod.</i>

25:35.305 --> 25:38.374
Six minutes to the window.
All: Yes, Chef.

25:38.442 --> 25:40.810
Wake up, Carrie, Jennifer.
Let's go!

25:40.877 --> 25:43.346
I am not a Carrie hater,
but I am not looking forward

25:43.413 --> 25:45.548
to working with her
on the meat station tonight.

25:45.616 --> 25:47.283
Are we sure there's
a burger on this?

25:47.351 --> 25:48.684
Yeah. One Wellington,
one cheeseburger.

25:48.752 --> 25:50.720
Correct? Yes.

25:50.787 --> 25:53.022
<i>Jennifer, what proteins</i>
<i>do you have right now?</i>

25:53.090 --> 25:57.226
One Wellington, one lamb,
two strips...And a burger.

25:57.294 --> 26:00.262
Okay, two strips.
So I have polenta right here.

26:00.330 --> 26:01.330
Let's go, guys.

26:01.398 --> 26:02.798
Right behind.

26:02.866 --> 26:05.167
Just put it down.

26:05.235 --> 26:07.603
(Jennifer)
Why do we have
a kids' burger?

26:07.671 --> 26:10.573
It's not even on the ticket.
Neither is the Wellington.

26:15.078 --> 26:17.647
All of you,
come here!

26:17.714 --> 26:20.516
It's the first
[bleep] Ticket of the night.

26:20.584 --> 26:24.487
Two bass, two New York strip,
one lamb, one cod.

26:24.554 --> 26:27.757
[Bleep].
No burger, no Wellington.

26:27.824 --> 26:31.060
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

26:31.128 --> 26:32.461
Your first ticket.

26:32.529 --> 26:35.998
Jennifer, this is
embarrassing!

26:36.066 --> 26:38.200
Half the dining room
is filled with children.

26:38.268 --> 26:39.969
Pathetic!

26:45.914 --> 26:48.882
(Announcer)
It's family night
in Hell's Kitchen,

26:48.950 --> 26:52.252
and after a strong start...
Service, please.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.955
(Announcer)
Carrie and Jennifer's mistake
on the first set of entrees

26:55.023 --> 26:57.291
has put the brakes
on the red kitchen.

26:57.358 --> 26:59.326
No burger, no Wellington.

26:59.394 --> 27:00.727
Your first ticket.

27:00.795 --> 27:03.263
Jennifer, this is
embarrassing!

27:03.331 --> 27:05.999
I'm mortified that
I was even a part of this.

27:06.067 --> 27:07.868
I will not go down
for Carrie.

27:07.936 --> 27:09.369
I should have just
pushed her away

27:09.437 --> 27:10.370
and had her do
something else.

27:10.438 --> 27:11.605
Start again.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.240
Both: Yes, Chef.

27:13.308 --> 27:15.342
(Announcer)
While the red team stumbles...

27:15.410 --> 27:18.111
Now's your chance
to get ahead.
Yes, Chef.

27:18.179 --> 27:20.480
(Announcer)
The blue team has completed
appetizers,

27:20.548 --> 27:22.482
and now they're ready to get
started on their first entrees.

27:22.550 --> 27:24.851
Okay, let's go.
Yes, Chef.

27:24.919 --> 27:26.954
<i>Two chicken tenders, one cod,</i>
<i>one lamb, one Wellington.</i>

27:27.021 --> 27:28.922
One strip,
one kids' spaghetti.

27:28.990 --> 27:31.058
Yes, Chef.
You also have a zucchini

27:31.125 --> 27:32.893
and a broccolini
on that dish.

27:32.961 --> 27:35.028
Get your broccolini going now,
get your spinach going.

27:35.096 --> 27:37.197
Get everything in your
[bleep] pans, and let's rock!

27:37.265 --> 27:39.266
Tommy, he ended up
messing up on appetizers,

27:39.334 --> 27:41.101
so after that, I was--
me, personally,

27:41.169 --> 27:42.836
I wasn't gonna have
none of that.

27:42.904 --> 27:44.071
Chef, I'm reading
this right here--

27:44.138 --> 27:45.339
turn around and put
the [bleep] food back.

27:45.406 --> 27:47.274
These are solo chicken...

27:47.342 --> 27:49.009
So if I have to work fish
and garnish at the same time,

27:49.077 --> 27:50.844
I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

27:50.912 --> 27:52.646
If you guys [bleep] me on this
fish, man, I'm gonna be pissed!

27:52.714 --> 27:54.214
I'm tired of losing.

27:54.282 --> 27:55.649
<i>(Tommy)</i>
<i>Dude, I'm sorry, bro...</i>

27:55.717 --> 27:56.883
Don't say sorry to me
ever, bro.

27:56.951 --> 27:58.785
Just [bleep] do it, man.
You got it.

27:58.853 --> 28:01.521
Will's great at calling out
and getting everybody on focus.

28:01.589 --> 28:03.523
Tommy, five [bleep]
potatoes, bro.

28:03.591 --> 28:06.326
I wanted to say,
"get away and leave me alone--

28:06.394 --> 28:08.161
I'm not an idiot."

28:08.229 --> 28:10.497
But it was much-needed help.
What's the ketchup for?

28:10.565 --> 28:12.833
Next time you start
giving me stuff I don't need,

28:12.900 --> 28:14.735
I'm just gonna
throw it at you.
Yes.

28:14.802 --> 28:16.870
(Announcer)
Thanks to a very vocal will,

28:16.938 --> 28:18.605
the blue team's first entrees
are leaving the kitchen.

28:18.673 --> 28:20.140
As for the red team,

28:20.208 --> 28:22.009
they are now ready
with the second attempt

28:22.076 --> 28:23.744
on their first entrees.
I'm ready. I'm ready.

28:23.811 --> 28:25.178
<i>Is it ready?</i>
You guys, I'm ready.

28:25.246 --> 28:26.346
Anybody else?
I'm ready.

28:26.414 --> 28:27.614
You ready?
I'm ready.

28:27.682 --> 28:29.282
Somebody send it then!

28:29.350 --> 28:30.884
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef.

28:30.952 --> 28:31.985
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Let's go, New York strip.</i>

28:32.053 --> 28:33.253
<i>Let's go, fast!</i>

28:33.321 --> 28:34.421
Right behind.

28:34.489 --> 28:36.390
The garnish is there.

28:36.457 --> 28:37.691
I have one.
<i>Is the other one behind?</i>

28:37.759 --> 28:40.027
Right behind it, Chef.

28:40.094 --> 28:42.095
It's gonna come back.
It's raw. I don't--

28:42.163 --> 28:43.664
should I put it in the oven?
<i>Put it in the oven.</i>

28:43.731 --> 28:44.231
Put it in the oven.
Come on, let's go.

28:44.298 --> 28:45.632
Hurry up.

28:45.700 --> 28:48.835
Let's go, Amanda.
Come on, girl, you got this!

28:48.903 --> 28:50.804
Where's the two bass?

28:50.872 --> 28:52.472
Two are in the oven.

28:52.540 --> 28:54.041
<i>Where's the sea bass?</i>
Two are in the oven.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.342
<i>Amanda!</i>
Yes, Chef.

28:55.410 --> 28:57.010
How long for
the first two bass?

28:57.078 --> 28:58.912
Three minutes, Chef.
It's raw. I didn't cook it.

28:58.980 --> 29:00.414
Three minutes?

29:00.481 --> 29:02.649
She said it should be,
like, one more minute.

29:02.717 --> 29:04.117
<i>That's because you didn't</i>
<i>sear it good enough, and you--</i>

29:04.185 --> 29:05.485
okay, you don't need
to yell at me.

29:05.553 --> 29:07.054
I'm already getting
yelled at by the Chef.

29:07.121 --> 29:08.755
Why the [bleep] are you
yelling at me?

29:08.823 --> 29:10.290
Let me cook
the [bleep] food.

29:10.358 --> 29:12.059
I'm not yelling.
I'm just telling you

29:12.126 --> 29:13.393
so you don't do that again
with that one.

29:13.461 --> 29:15.996
Stop. Stop!

29:16.064 --> 29:17.764
All of you!

29:17.832 --> 29:19.032
There's nothing happening,
Amanda!

29:19.100 --> 29:20.901
I'm sorry, you guys.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.070
(Announcer)
While Chef Ramsay
and some children

29:23.137 --> 29:25.739
are still waiting on
the red team's first entrees,

29:25.807 --> 29:27.641
over in the blue kitchen...
Two Wellington,

29:27.709 --> 29:29.543
one lamb, one strip,
two burgers.

29:29.610 --> 29:31.978
All: Yes, Chef.
Let's go, Natalie.

29:32.046 --> 29:34.314
(Announcer)
All eyes are on Natalie
on the meat station.

29:34.382 --> 29:37.884
You got everything going?
Yeah. We're waiting on you.

29:37.952 --> 29:40.320
<i>Natalie, you drive</i>
<i>the ticket, right?</i>
It's in, everything's in.

29:40.388 --> 29:42.322
You're just waiting.
I'm just waiting, yeah.

29:42.390 --> 29:43.623
It's go time.
Natalie should be coming out

29:43.691 --> 29:45.926
with fire out of
her [bleep] eyes.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.294
Oh, my gosh, it's raw.

29:47.361 --> 29:50.630
It's raw?

29:50.698 --> 29:52.599
They're not cooking
how they're supposed to.

29:52.667 --> 29:53.700
(Announcer)
While the blue kitchen waits

29:53.768 --> 29:55.268
on Natalie's Wellingtons,

29:55.336 --> 29:57.304
the families on the red side
are hoping

29:57.371 --> 29:59.106
food will be coming their way
in the near future.

29:59.173 --> 30:00.507
What's going, Amanda?

30:00.575 --> 30:03.176
I'm sorry, Chef?
What's going?

30:03.244 --> 30:05.779
I have two bass on this ticket,
Chef, with a lamb.

30:05.847 --> 30:08.148
<i>And a cod.</i>
And a cod?

30:08.216 --> 30:09.950
And a cod.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.419
The cod's not on?
The cod is not on, Chef.

30:12.487 --> 30:14.621
What?
I forgot about it.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.490
Oh, my God!

30:16.557 --> 30:21.728
Amanda...
Is there anyone home?

30:21.796 --> 30:24.364
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>You haven't got the cod on?</i>
I forgot about it.

30:24.432 --> 30:26.466
[Strained chuckle]
Ugh!

30:26.534 --> 30:29.002
It's family night...
Disaster night!

30:29.070 --> 30:30.403
I'm sorry, Chef.

30:30.471 --> 30:33.240
[Utensils clang]

30:33.307 --> 30:34.908
You're gonna be up
on that chopping block

30:34.976 --> 30:36.309
if you don't
get it together, girl.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.911
I look over,
I see Amanda,

30:37.979 --> 30:40.747
and she is just
absolutely blank stare.

30:40.815 --> 30:42.282
She's a deer in headlights.

30:42.350 --> 30:43.683
She's shutting down
by the second.

30:43.751 --> 30:46.119
I'm sorry for
letting you guys down.

30:46.187 --> 30:47.387
Amanda...
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

30:47.455 --> 30:48.688
Fight back!
Yes, Chef.

30:48.756 --> 30:51.525
For God's sake, woman,
get some dignity!

30:51.592 --> 30:54.227
It's our first table.

30:54.295 --> 30:56.363
(Announcer)
While Amanda holds up
the red kitchen,

30:56.430 --> 30:59.366
the blue kitchen's
still waiting on Natalie.

30:59.433 --> 31:01.468
I'm just running behind
on those Wellingtons.

31:01.536 --> 31:03.637
Natalie...
Wake up!

31:03.704 --> 31:05.972
(Natalie)
Right now I feel like
the spotlight's

31:06.040 --> 31:07.574
kind of on me.

31:07.642 --> 31:09.976
I need to step up, or
I'm gonna fall on my face.

31:10.044 --> 31:12.779
Natalie, driving,
how long?
One minute.

31:12.847 --> 31:14.247
One minute.
Thank you.

31:14.315 --> 31:15.816
Let's go, Natalie.

31:15.883 --> 31:17.584
Yes, Chef. Coming up
with two Wellingtons.

31:17.652 --> 31:20.220
Behind, behind.

31:20.288 --> 31:21.621
Two Wellingtons, Chef.

31:21.689 --> 31:24.591
(Gordon)
Natalie, good job. Go.

31:24.659 --> 31:26.126
Beef Wellington.

31:26.194 --> 31:28.261
(Announcer)
With Natalie back in her groove,

31:28.329 --> 31:30.130
families on the blue side
are enjoying their meal.

31:30.198 --> 31:32.866
That's good stuff.
<i>Yummy, huh?</i>

31:32.934 --> 31:34.267
(Announcer)
But the families
on the red side

31:34.335 --> 31:36.436
continue to wait.

31:36.504 --> 31:37.704
Ah...

31:37.772 --> 31:38.972
How much time now?

31:39.040 --> 31:40.674
We're waiting on the lamb.

31:40.741 --> 31:42.275
Are you standing there
with your hands on your hip

31:42.343 --> 31:43.176
<i>while we're trying</i>
<i>to put this ticket out?</i>

31:43.244 --> 31:44.411
No, I am not.

31:44.478 --> 31:45.745
I better see you
cooking something!

31:45.813 --> 31:47.347
Elise is always
yelling at me.

31:47.415 --> 31:48.715
<i>See what I mean?</i>

31:48.783 --> 31:50.283
I'm not gonna let her
get to me.

31:50.351 --> 31:51.785
I know I can cook.
I know I'm good.

31:51.853 --> 31:53.420
How long till window?

31:53.487 --> 31:54.955
We have one more minute.

31:55.022 --> 31:56.323
Please, let's get it up.

31:56.390 --> 31:58.124
Garnish. Let's go.

31:58.192 --> 32:00.327
Here we go.
30 seconds to window.
Yes, Chef.

32:00.394 --> 32:02.329
Where's the bass?
It's coming up right now.

32:02.396 --> 32:04.831
Service.
Where's the lamb?

32:04.899 --> 32:07.400
It's right here, Chef.
Let's go.

32:07.468 --> 32:11.238
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Garnish, please.</i>

32:11.305 --> 32:13.540

And more importantly,
never, <i>ever</i> give up.

41:19.384 --> 41:21.151
Got it?
All: Yes, Chef.

41:21.219 --> 41:23.287
Get out.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.489
Blue team, well done.
All: Thank you, Chef.

41:25.557 --> 41:27.691
I'm so mad I could
punch a wall out.

41:27.759 --> 41:29.226
Carrie has zero talent.

41:29.294 --> 41:30.761
The sight of her
makes me want to puke.

41:30.829 --> 41:32.263
And if Amanda had to go,

41:32.330 --> 41:33.898
Carrie should have went
along with her.

41:33.965 --> 41:36.333
Elise, she kinda just
made a fool out of herself.

41:36.401 --> 41:38.302
Sorry, honey,
I'm not going anywhere.

41:38.370 --> 41:40.037
I will defend myself.
I'm not gonna let anyone

41:40.105 --> 41:42.840
try and stab me in the back.
Uh-uh.

41:42.908 --> 41:44.542
Taking how low
the women feel,

41:44.609 --> 41:45.943
we want to drive them
that much lower.

41:46.011 --> 41:47.545
If they're five feet under
right now,

41:47.612 --> 41:49.647
I want to put 'em ten feet
under--take no prisoners.

41:49.714 --> 41:52.883
(Gordon)
Amanda lost the will
to cook on the line tonight.

41:52.951 --> 41:55.019
I lost the will
to keep her here.

Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:04.262 --> 42:06.830
Man your station!
Yo, man, you ain't
gotta talk...

42:06.898 --> 42:08.732
(Announcer)
There's fighting
on the blue team...

42:08.800 --> 42:10.134
Whatever, man.
If you're gonna quit,

42:10.201 --> 42:11.702
then just quit now.
Get the [bleep] out of here!

42:11.770 --> 42:13.637
(Announcer)
There's fighting
on the red team...

42:13.705 --> 42:15.539
Keep your [bleep] opinion
to yourself.
No! No!

42:15.607 --> 42:17.608
<i>Oh!</i>
Shut up, I'm talking!

42:17.676 --> 42:19.376
(Announcer)
But when Chefs cross the line...

42:19.444 --> 42:22.179
Don't talk back to me.
Whatever.

42:22.247 --> 42:23.814
You're so [bleep]
disrespectful.

42:23.882 --> 42:25.249
(Announcer)
And dare to fight...

42:25.317 --> 42:26.517
You ain't gonna keep
[bleep] cussing at me.

42:26.585 --> 42:27.751
I don't give a [bleep]
Who you are.

42:27.819 --> 42:28.819
(Announcer)
With the sous chefs...

42:28.887 --> 42:30.120
Alls you have to do
is bring it up!

42:30.188 --> 42:31.422
I understand.
Then do it!

42:31.489 --> 42:33.123
Then it's done, then.
[Bleep] you!

42:33.191 --> 42:34.758
Well, [bleep] you too, then!
Stop!

42:34.826 --> 42:36.927
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay...
Come here, you!

42:36.995 --> 42:39.129
(Announcer)
Has the final word.
Pathetic.

42:39.197 --> 42:41.065
(Announcer)
And what happens
at elimination...

42:41.132 --> 42:42.700
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

42:42.767 --> 42:44.301
(Announcer)
Shocks everyone.

42:44.369 --> 42:47.871
All next time on a tear-jerking,
heart-stopping...

42:47.939 --> 42:50.007
Shut up!
(Announcer)
Jaw-dropping...

42:50.075 --> 42:52.042
Wow!
