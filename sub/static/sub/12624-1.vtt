00:00.900 --> 00:02.634
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:02.669 --> 00:04.303
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:04.337 --> 00:06.839
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:06.873 --> 00:09.641
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

00:14.414 --> 00:15.881
<i>Good afternoon, everybody.</i>

00:15.915 --> 00:17.216
<i>Hans mikenluber here,</i>

00:17.250 --> 00:19.385
<i>voice to
the lemon oaks ice hounds.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:21.420
<i>It's been hand-to-hand action</i>

00:21.454 --> 00:22.988
<i>all afternoon.</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:25.090
<i>As always,
our ice hounds are down,</i>

00:25.125 --> 00:28.293
<i>plagued by penalties
and sloppy mistakes.</i>

00:28.328 --> 00:30.863
<i>The hounds trail
the rivals norsemen</i>

00:30.897 --> 00:32.731
<i>4 to 2.</i>

00:32.766 --> 00:34.900
<i>The question
on everyone's mind...</i>

00:34.934 --> 00:37.002
<i>Why is lemon oaks'
superstar player</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:38.704
<i>sitting on the bench?</i>

00:38.738 --> 00:41.774
Alex! Alex! Alex!

00:41.808 --> 00:44.643
Alex! Alex! Alex!

00:44.677 --> 00:47.579
<i>Alex Pearson is
back in the game!</i>

00:47.614 --> 00:50.182
Goose, I'm open!

00:50.216 --> 00:51.784
<i>Gustavo passes to Pearson</i>

00:51.818 --> 00:55.120
<i>who takes the puck and forces
the action up the ice.</i>

00:56.523 --> 00:58.490
<i>Pearson fakes right,
then powers up the center,</i>

00:58.525 --> 01:01.593
<i>skating like
the street ball of hockey.</i>

01:01.628 --> 01:03.095
Alex! Alex!

01:03.129 --> 01:06.532
<i>And he lines up...</i>
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:06.566 --> 01:08.400
<i>And he scores!</i>

01:08.435 --> 01:10.669
You are the man! Whoo-hoo!

01:10.703 --> 01:13.172
<i>That's three goals and
a hat trick for Alex Pearson,</i>

01:13.206 --> 01:15.641
<i>earning him another
ice hound record!</i>

01:16.843 --> 01:18.911
Thank you!

01:18.945 --> 01:20.646
It was a team effort!

01:20.680 --> 01:22.548
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:22.582 --> 01:24.316
That's three for you.
We don't deserve you, Alex.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.418
Pearson does it again,
but we're still down by one,

01:26.453 --> 01:28.053
so let's use
my pressure offense.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.555
They'll never expect it.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.491
Alex!
Oh, sorry, man.

01:32.525 --> 01:33.992
Titus is all mine.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.862
Hey, work the puck to Alex.

01:36.896 --> 01:38.864
Let's go, hounds! Let's go!

01:38.898 --> 01:41.533
Alex! Alex!
<i>The hounds</i>
<i>are still down by 1.</i>

01:41.568 --> 01:43.902
<i>Why can't every player
be as good as Alex?</i>

01:43.937 --> 01:45.404
Come on, buddy! Come on!

01:45.438 --> 01:47.206
Come on, Alex.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.408
<i>Gustavo keeps it!</i>
I've got it! Dude!

01:49.442 --> 01:52.010
- Dude, what are you doing?
- <i>They seem to be fighting over the puck.</i>

01:52.045 --> 01:54.880
<i>And, oh!
They go down in a heap!</i>

01:54.914 --> 01:57.316
<i>Novetsky has a breakaway.</i>

01:59.052 --> 02:02.321
<i>And scores the winning goal!</i>

02:08.026 --> 02:09.828
<i>Well, that's the game.</i>

02:09.863 --> 02:12.498
<i>The ice hounds lose 5 to 3.</i>

02:12.532 --> 02:14.766
<i>And it's another crushing defeat</i>

02:14.801 --> 02:17.136
<i>for our beloved hounds.</i>

02:17.170 --> 02:19.771
<i>But stellar play by Alex Pearson</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:21.673
<i>nets him another hat trick,</i>

02:21.708 --> 02:23.275
<i>so go, Alex.</i>

02:24.644 --> 02:26.979
What are you so happy about?
We lost.

02:27.013 --> 02:29.648
Goose, hockey is not all about

02:29.682 --> 02:31.216
winning and losing.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.051
It's about challenging yourself

02:33.086 --> 02:35.787
to be the best you can be
and I played great!

02:35.822 --> 02:38.624
I... and you're coming along too.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.660
I am sorry about that little...

02:41.694 --> 02:43.128
Bump.

02:45.265 --> 02:47.332
No problem.
I know I was too slow.

02:47.367 --> 02:50.702
But seriously, Alex, I think
we should've won this game.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.938
Goose, goose, goose.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.508
Let's try to be
a little zen about this.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.845
We are a 500 team. We're never
going to make the playoffs

02:59.879 --> 03:01.747
but if I keep playing like this,

03:01.781 --> 03:04.216
I could make
the high school all-stars.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.585
I'm just saying maybe you should
think about the ice hounds.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.387
I am thinking
about the ice hounds.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.489
Think of the notoriety
it would bring the team

03:10.523 --> 03:13.192
if I was on the all-stars.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.494
So, you want a game
at my house?
Yes.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.829
Yeah... no! No! No no.
There's something I have to do.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.398
I told you. What was it?

03:19.432 --> 03:21.733
Uh, taking care of your sister?
Yes. Yes.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.736
Well, she's been
fed and watered recently.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.238
She'll be fine, right?

03:26.306 --> 03:28.173
I can probably
come over for one level.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.209
Go home, Alex.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.510
Half a level?
No.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.178
Lemonade?
Nope.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.246
Something?
No.

03:39.285 --> 03:40.752
Hello, Alex.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.124
Hello, Mrs. jacklitz.

03:46.159 --> 03:49.161
You're looking very spry today.

03:49.195 --> 03:51.463
Mm-hmm.

03:59.138 --> 04:01.139
Okay, so then
you just take that three

04:01.174 --> 04:03.008
and you carry it
over to the next column.

04:03.042 --> 04:04.910
But that's not how
they showed us at school, dad.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.812
Well, maybe not,
but it'll work in a pinch.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.880
In a pinch, it'll work.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.415
All right, I am home.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.117
Let the celebrating begin.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.820
Finally. Alex,
where have you been?

04:14.854 --> 04:16.721
I've got a lecture
in 12 minutes.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.992
What's the big deal?
Think of it as more
quality time with Emily.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.627
And besides,
you could have left.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.462
Ingrid is right here.

04:23.496 --> 04:26.932
All right, for one thing,
Ingrid is our housekeeper,
not our babysitter.

04:29.869 --> 04:32.137
For a variety of reasons,

04:32.171 --> 04:34.673
I want you here watching Emily.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.208
All right?

04:38.444 --> 04:40.379
I had a game, by the way, dad.

04:40.413 --> 04:41.913
Thanks for asking.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.615
I know you had a game,

04:43.650 --> 04:45.817
and I'm sure
that you were great.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.653
And you know I'd be there
if I wasn't teaching

04:47.687 --> 04:49.154
five classes this semester.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.689
I know.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.924
Dad, I'm... I'm sorry,
but can you make it

04:52.959 --> 04:54.993
to one game, or try?

04:56.362 --> 04:57.829
Of course.
Thank you.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.865
Okay, frozen dinners
are on the counter.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.567
Make sure
your sister eats at least

05:02.602 --> 05:05.270
some vegetables.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.239
Oh, and make sure
that she does her homework

05:07.273 --> 05:09.107
before television.

05:09.142 --> 05:13.178
All right. Oh, this is
going towards my car, right?

05:14.947 --> 05:17.416
Oh, and I'm going to be at the
university all day tomorrow too,

05:17.450 --> 05:19.851
so don't forget to pick up
Emily from her Bumblebee meeting
at school.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.553
4:00.

05:21.587 --> 05:23.455
Okay, so, uh...

05:23.489 --> 05:25.724
Don't forget Mrs. jacklitz
is always home

05:25.758 --> 05:27.659
if there's an emergency.
Yep.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.928
I'm sure she'd be as big
of a help in a crisis

05:29.962 --> 05:31.630
as Ingrid would be.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.634
No offense, Ingrid.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.541
Oh... oh, no, no, no.
There's no way we're watching

05:42.575 --> 05:44.076
<i>bunny friends forever.</i>

05:44.110 --> 05:45.811
But it's a new one.
No, it's not!

05:45.845 --> 05:47.713
I've seen this one.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.247
And don't start
with the Doe eyes,

05:49.282 --> 05:52.451
because today, we are
watching extreme sports.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.821
<i>Everybody
going to make it through?</i>

05:58.991 --> 06:00.892
<i>Lose control.</i>

06:00.927 --> 06:02.661
<i>Now the fun starts, everybody...</i>

06:04.263 --> 06:05.997
No! Uh...
Give it, Alex!

06:06.032 --> 06:08.567
Alex! Alex! Please!
No!

06:08.601 --> 06:11.036
Please.

06:11.070 --> 06:14.506
I control the plasma.
I am getting my way.

06:15.975 --> 06:17.542
Volume. Yes.

06:17.577 --> 06:21.146
<i>Out there now.
Just 5 remaining here.</i>

06:25.818 --> 06:27.386
<i>Near the end
of the straightaway,</i>

06:27.420 --> 06:30.255
<i>4 huge leaps.
The top 2 riders racing...</i>

06:35.661 --> 06:37.929
Wouldn't be popcorn
be great right now?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.793
We've been together forever.

07:07.827 --> 07:11.096
You'll just have to study
the handbook on your own at home

07:11.130 --> 07:12.664
until Bumblebee headquarters

07:12.698 --> 07:14.566
can assign you
to your new troops.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.802
Oh!

07:16.836 --> 07:19.070
Whoa. What's up, Mrs. m?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.972
They're shutting us down.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.975
Troop 57 is crashing down
all around us

07:24.010 --> 07:25.510
even as we speak.

07:25.545 --> 07:28.980
Izzy's dad was lucky enough
to get a new job in Chicago

07:29.015 --> 07:30.649
and we're leaving right away.

07:30.683 --> 07:33.351
I've talked
to all the other moms
and they can't do it.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.153
No one seems
to be able to take over.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.721
This is not happening!

07:36.756 --> 07:38.590
We've been together forever.

07:38.624 --> 07:42.093
But you are still bumblebees.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.229
You're just going to be split up

07:44.263 --> 07:47.265
and slipped into
existing troops.
Doesn't that sound great?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.868
But me and Abigail
and Ursula and Tina,

07:49.902 --> 07:52.671
we formed a troop because
we're all best friends.

07:52.705 --> 07:55.006
What about me?

07:55.041 --> 07:57.609
And Rachel is
sort of our friend too.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.845
Excuse me.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.180
What are we going to do?

08:03.382 --> 08:05.617
All right!
Enough with the shrieking.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.953
Girls, don't freak out.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.789
One of your mothers is
going to volunteer eventually.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.924
My mom's a long-haul trucker.
She's away a lot.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.560
I have four brothers
with self-control problems.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.295
I didn't say it was
going to be easy.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.565
I just said it can be done,
but... well, you're probably

08:20.600 --> 08:22.367
going to have to
guilt them into it,

08:22.401 --> 08:24.703
so let's see your sad faces.

08:26.439 --> 08:29.374
That seemed a little forced.
Oh, no... no, wait.

08:29.408 --> 08:32.477
Everyone, copy Rachel.
I wasn't doing it.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.380
Well, even if they can

08:35.414 --> 08:37.148
dig up another
den mother for us,

08:37.183 --> 08:40.818
it'll take so long, we'll never
get into camporee.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.821
Yeah.
We've got to get into camporee.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.054
Camporee?

08:44.090 --> 08:45.657
Camporee is only

08:45.691 --> 08:48.393
the most important
Bumblebee even of the year.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.263
And they don't
let you just waltz in.
Yeah.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.665
There's all this stuff you
need to do to qualify for it.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.901
Sounds like a real hoot.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.103
Girls, I am so sorry,

08:58.137 --> 09:00.472
but I have a situation.

09:00.506 --> 09:01.786
And so, the meeting is canceled.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.412
Alex is going to stay with you
until your parents show up.

09:07.446 --> 09:08.647
What? No, no, no.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.415
I have like 100 cool things
I've got to go do.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.083
Izzy, come with me.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.853
Girls, I will see you all

09:14.887 --> 09:16.421
at the goodbye brunch

09:16.455 --> 09:18.089
if it happens.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.125
Bye, Izzy. We're all
going to miss you.
Bye, Izzy.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.260
I'm going to miss you.
Bye.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.796
See you soon!

09:24.830 --> 09:27.132
Alex, can you please run the
meeting, not just baby-sit us?

09:27.166 --> 09:28.867
Please?
No.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.969
- Oh, please, please, please!
- Please! Please!

09:31.003 --> 09:32.504
Please! Please!

09:32.538 --> 09:34.539
No. No! No!

09:34.574 --> 09:37.275
No, there is no way
that I'm going to be

09:37.310 --> 09:40.779
your designated den mother.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.382
This meeting of troop 57
of the bumblebees

09:44.417 --> 09:45.884
will return to order on the...

09:45.918 --> 09:47.452
Ah-ah-ah!

09:47.486 --> 09:49.454
When you talk, you have to use

09:49.488 --> 09:52.123
the troop 57 talking flower.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.793
It means it's your turn
and only you can talk.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.301
Emily's out of uniform.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.036
She's not supposed to wear
a Princess tiara.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.539
It's against the rules.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.429
Well, it's not against my rules.
Maybe she's a...

10:13.512 --> 10:15.847
A Bumblebee Princess girl
or something.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.219
Alex, then can I be
a Bumblebee vampire girl?

10:21.253 --> 10:22.887
What?

10:22.922 --> 10:24.489
Yes. I don't care.

10:24.523 --> 10:26.925
You girls can wear
whatever you want.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.259
You don't have
the talking flower.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.095
Okay.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.732
Okay, no rule...
The talking flower is now moot.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.034
There is no more talking flower.

10:36.068 --> 10:37.602
It's not even over there,
don't look.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.104
Now, whatever
you girls were doing

10:39.138 --> 10:41.039
before I got here, do that.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.374
We weren't doing anything.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.476
Mrs. moffat took forever
to tell us she's dumping us.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.345
Yeah.
Well, what do you want to do?

10:47.380 --> 10:48.947
Tina?

10:52.218 --> 10:54.219
Okay. Anybody else?

10:54.253 --> 10:57.422
You could look
at pictures of cute boys.
Sure.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.957
Okay.
No... no.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.625
Uh, I don't...
I don't think so.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.162
- Well, we could do a go-for-it.
- Yeah!

11:04.196 --> 11:06.064
Yeah!
A go-for-it is when we try

11:06.098 --> 11:07.932
a new activity, craft or skill.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.988
All right, let's go
over this one more time.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.924
You give 100%.

11:32.958 --> 11:36.061
You never back off,
you never back down.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.829
Now, let's go.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.032
Let's go.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.567
Oh, my.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.771
Come on! Let's go!

11:46.806 --> 11:48.573
Let's go! Hustle up! Hustle up!

11:48.607 --> 11:52.310
Emily, do you
want to catch up or not?

11:52.344 --> 11:54.446
Come on! Go faster!

11:54.547 --> 11:57.449
Okay, uh, you're
going way too slow.

11:57.483 --> 12:00.351
Hockey's a fast sport.
You have to be fast.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.887
But it's right there!
What are you doing?

12:02.922 --> 12:04.989
What are you doing?

12:05.024 --> 12:07.792
All right, come on, girls!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

12:07.827 --> 12:09.427
I'll get it! I'll get it!

12:09.462 --> 12:11.496
All right, Emily, you've
got this. You've got this.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.897
Okay, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

12:12.932 --> 12:14.365
Yes, this is it.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.468
All right, now
work behind the net, Abigail.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.936
There it... there it is!

12:17.970 --> 12:19.671
All right, someone, take a shot.
Take a shot!

12:19.705 --> 12:21.439
Shoot! Shoot!

12:28.481 --> 12:30.682
Good effort, girls.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.351
Now, that's how
you run a power play.
I'm cold.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.153
You okay, Tina?
Mm-hmm.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.789
All right.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.591
You all right, Rachel?

12:39.625 --> 12:41.926
My feet hurt.
What's that?

12:41.961 --> 12:43.628
That's a zamboni.

12:43.662 --> 12:45.964
Look, girls,
those are all indicators

12:45.998 --> 12:48.366
that you're playing correctly.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.969
Why can't we do something fun?
Becoming great hockey players

12:51.003 --> 12:53.304
is the most fun thing
in the world.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.974
And how would you
know that, dork?

12:57.576 --> 13:00.378
Don't tell me. Titus.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.647
Do you really
not want me to tell you?

13:02.681 --> 13:05.550
Well, what do we have here?

13:06.652 --> 13:08.386
Some new ice hounds?

13:08.420 --> 13:09.888
They are definitely
a lot tougher

13:09.922 --> 13:12.857
than the guys you got now.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.660
Definitely a lot
tougher than you.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.398
Get him, Alex! Get him!

13:25.671 --> 13:28.706
Come on!

13:31.777 --> 13:33.311
Does it hurt, Alex?

13:33.345 --> 13:35.313
Only when you talk...

13:37.850 --> 13:39.350
Or stare at me.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.990
Know what? Today was the best

13:46.025 --> 13:47.592
Bumblebee girls meeting ever.

13:49.128 --> 13:52.997
If mom were alive, would she
bring me to the meetings?

13:55.968 --> 13:57.802
Of course she would, em.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.039
Alex, I'm glad you're here
to take me to the meetings.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.455
Seriously, why her?

14:19.091 --> 14:20.692
Hmm?

14:22.728 --> 14:24.863
You're like a psychic detective,
you know that?

14:24.897 --> 14:27.265
Dude, some genetic twist of fate

14:27.299 --> 14:29.067
has made you good at hockey.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.302
In the one town that would
actually care about that.

14:33.105 --> 14:35.145
That's like having a free
date-anyone-you-want card.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.208
Why Matisse?

14:40.212 --> 14:43.081
Okay, yeah, she's pretty.
So what? She doesn't like you.

14:43.115 --> 14:45.483
All right, there are
a ton of pretty girls

14:45.517 --> 14:47.085
who would love to date you.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.454
She's really smart.

14:50.956 --> 14:54.225
Yeah, we know that from the fact
that she won't go out with you.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.961
Correction... she's not
gone out with me yet.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.897
I made eye contact
with her at the game.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.999
I think I'm really starting
to wear her down. Watch.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.401
Yeah. That changes a lot.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.006
What happened to you?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.741
This? It's nothing.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.609
I ran into a couple of bad guys,

15:11.644 --> 15:13.511
had to put the hurt
down on them.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.380
You know how it goes.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.149
Oh, I thought maybe
you got it in your last game,

15:18.183 --> 15:20.752
you know, when you stole
the puck from your friend

15:20.786 --> 15:22.787
and ended up on your butt
while the norsemen

15:22.821 --> 15:24.789
scored the winning goal.

15:24.823 --> 15:28.559
Well, you saw the hat trick
before that, right?

15:28.594 --> 15:31.629
You never give poor goose
a chance on the ice.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.198
What...
you've made him
your personal driver.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.034
I swear, I don't even know
why he's your friend.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.869
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
it's not a big deal.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.343
He doesn't mind
being knocked around.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.606
It's just friendly in hockey.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.808
When you check someone,
it's... it's like saying hello.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.510
Hello?

15:45.544 --> 15:47.278
And goodbye.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.848
It's like... it's kind of like
"aloha," but Matisse,

15:50.883 --> 15:53.318
I just wanted to know
if maybe this Friday night,

15:53.352 --> 15:55.553
we could do...
I... I'm busy.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.355
Doing what?

15:57.389 --> 15:59.157
I'll find something.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.226
Matisse?

16:02.261 --> 16:04.062
I'm just keeping it real.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.664
I am a highly pursued date
at this school

16:06.699 --> 16:09.701
and you should just jump
at the opportunity to date me.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.303
I... I'm just saying.
I'm trying to help you.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.173
Really?

16:15.207 --> 16:18.576
Can I just say something
to you in hockey?
Yeah.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.244
Aloha.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.884
And by the way,
that was an aloha goodbye,

16:26.919 --> 16:28.419
not aloha hello.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.424
I don't have a car.
That's the problem.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.926
That's why she won't date me.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.362
Alex, your old man's never
going to get you that car.

16:37.396 --> 16:38.997
Oh, my pessimistic
little friend,

16:39.031 --> 16:41.499
there's always a solution
to the exceptional person.

16:41.533 --> 16:44.435
You just have to think
outside the box.

16:49.475 --> 16:52.710
Alex! Alex! Alex!

16:52.778 --> 16:55.613
<i>Slight delay
in getting started, folks.</i>

16:55.647 --> 16:57.882
<i>However, we are looking
forward to a great game</i>

16:57.916 --> 17:00.818
<i>between the tigers
and the ice hounds.</i>

17:00.853 --> 17:03.187
You're enabling him, Gary.
Come on, Neal.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.722
He just likes
to make an entrance.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.257
The crowd loves it.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.358
Well, love it or not,
if he's not on the ice

17:08.394 --> 17:10.261
in 10 seconds...

17:10.295 --> 17:13.964
<i>And now, a big
lemon oaks welcome</i>

17:13.999 --> 17:17.300
<i>to everyone's
favorite ice hound...</i>

17:17.336 --> 17:19.871
<i>Alex Pearson!</i>

17:19.905 --> 17:22.807
Whoo!

17:22.840 --> 17:24.442
<i>Alex wanted me to let you know</i>

17:24.476 --> 17:27.845
<i>that he's sponsored by
Moses roses fine florist shop.</i>

17:27.880 --> 17:30.982
<i>♪ Moses roses, Moses roses ♪</i>

17:31.016 --> 17:33.885
Whoo!

17:42.061 --> 17:43.895
Moses roses! Moses roses!

17:51.170 --> 17:52.837
Gary!

18:02.448 --> 18:04.916
Alex, this is just...
It's too much.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.951
Nascar drivers do it.

18:06.985 --> 18:09.220
This is good for everyone.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.323
It's what I call
the win-win-win scenario.

18:12.357 --> 18:15.259
Moses roses gets advertising.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.829
The crowd gets information
as well as a show.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.997
And I get...
Suspended!

18:20.032 --> 18:21.632
What?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.267
Neal, please, don't suspend him.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.969
I'm not going to, you are.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.939
Either you control your player
or I'll bench your entire team

18:27.973 --> 18:29.941
for the rest of the season.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.478
Alex, go collect your things.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.346
Coach, you can't
let him suspend me like that.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.215
It's out of my hands.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.951
I'm afraid you really
blew it this time, son.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.357
I am so disappointed.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.727
So am I. How am I supposed
to make the all-stars now?

18:50.863 --> 18:53.698
In you, Alex.
I am disappointed in you.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.199
What, for my initiative?

18:55.234 --> 18:56.767
Dad, let's face facts here.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.637
You are just as guilty
in this situation as I am.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.506
You're the one that told me

19:01.540 --> 19:03.141
I had to help pay for the car.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.642
You forced me to take
drastic action.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.978
What I said was if you pay
for your own insurance,

19:07.012 --> 19:09.147
I would consider
buying you a car

19:09.181 --> 19:10.848
if your attitude improved.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.753
All right.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.421
Well, there's nothing to do

19:17.456 --> 19:20.091
except for use this time
to rest up and wait
for the coach

19:20.125 --> 19:21.659
to lift the suspension.
Oh, no, no!

19:21.693 --> 19:23.394
No, no, no, no, no.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.796
No, the whole
laissez-faire parenting,

19:25.831 --> 19:27.365
that stops right now.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.933
You're going to work.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.434
Dad, I couldn't
in good conscience

19:30.469 --> 19:32.136
take a job knowing i could be

19:32.171 --> 19:34.805
put back onto
the team at any second.
You're going to work here.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.607
Yeah, it's about time
somebody trimmed those hedges

19:36.642 --> 19:38.109
back into shape.

19:38.143 --> 19:39.610
The whole yard needs weeding,

19:39.645 --> 19:41.112
the sprinkler heads
need replacing.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.680
It's high time
you learned to take

19:42.714 --> 19:44.115
a little responsibility, Alex.

19:44.149 --> 19:47.018
Maybe then
we'll talk about a car.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.628
I just need to borrow
you for a minute.
Wait, whoa!

19:57.663 --> 19:59.197
What are you doing?

19:59.231 --> 20:01.732
What?
Wave.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.903
The parents want to see
that there's a responsible

20:05.938 --> 20:07.471
junior helper at the meeting.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.607
So, look responsible.

20:09.641 --> 20:11.175
- Can I go now?
- Bye, honey.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.977
Just two more cars.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.481
Hey, maybe I should
bring Ingrid out here

20:17.516 --> 20:20.451
so that all the parents can
see there's adult supervision.

20:20.485 --> 20:23.154
Oh! Oh!

20:24.456 --> 20:28.159
Yeah, I'm sure that'll
fill them with confidence.

20:28.193 --> 20:31.162
<i>It's going to be hard to stop,
no doubt, on this play.</i>

20:31.196 --> 20:33.130
<i>As long as he
has time to make the throw,</i>

20:33.165 --> 20:34.832
<i>you can guarantee he's
going to find the open...</i>

20:34.866 --> 20:36.734
Alex?

20:37.936 --> 20:39.670
Alex, are you busy?
Yeah.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.472
Dad gave me like
100 million chores to do.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.608
But you're playing video games.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.509
No. Part of my mind
is playing video games.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.578
My subconscious
is formulating a plan.

20:47.613 --> 20:50.014
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

20:50.048 --> 20:51.349
Oh! No! No, no, no!

20:51.383 --> 20:54.018
Hey! Bee-free zone.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.454
Guilt didn't work.
None of our parents cracked.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.923
And so, we still
don't have a den mom.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.691
Can you walk us
to the community center?

21:00.726 --> 21:02.260
There's a buddy troop activity.

21:02.294 --> 21:03.527
What?

21:03.562 --> 21:05.363
This one is
a basket decorating party.
Yeah.

21:05.397 --> 21:06.897
If you have a buddy troop,

21:06.932 --> 21:08.366
why don't you
ask them to take you?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.900
They might help us.
Lorna's sister Matisse

21:09.935 --> 21:11.836
- is their junior helper.
- Oh, Matisse.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.904
She might take us.
Yeah, she would
totally take us.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.274
Wait wait wait, Rachel,
did you just say a basket
decorating party?

21:16.308 --> 21:18.509
Yeah.
That is completely different!

21:18.543 --> 21:20.011
Why didn't you say that
from the beginning?

21:20.045 --> 21:21.445
I am in!

21:26.952 --> 21:28.452
What is he doing?

21:30.022 --> 21:31.656
Good job, girls.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.394
Now we can form a chain.
Okay.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.062
- Grab my hand.
- Okay.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.897
Let's form a chain.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.668
Alex?
Matisse.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.071
What are you doing here?

21:47.105 --> 21:50.374
Um, I'm a junior helper
for my sister's bee troop.

21:50.409 --> 21:54.078
No way. I'm a junior helper
for my sister's bee troop.

21:54.112 --> 21:56.113
And before you say anything,

21:56.148 --> 21:59.383
it's... I know it's not
a very guy thing to do,

21:59.418 --> 22:02.620
so let me have it. Where's
the making fun of me, the jokes?

22:02.654 --> 22:04.388
No no, it's... it's great.

22:04.423 --> 22:07.024
It's, you know,
kind of surprising.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.360
Girls!

22:09.394 --> 22:11.429
Less talking, more working.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.165
Uh, you should
grab a seat and get gluing.

22:14.199 --> 22:17.301
If you want to make baskets
that are easily sold,

22:17.336 --> 22:20.071
just follow directions
and do as you're told.

22:22.808 --> 22:25.209
Clippings are not
to be left on the floor!

22:25.243 --> 22:27.511
They are to be placed
in the middle of the table

22:27.546 --> 22:30.915
for easy recycling later.

22:30.949 --> 22:33.217
Seriously,

22:33.251 --> 22:35.119
you should
get your girls working.

22:35.153 --> 22:37.988
More glue, more glue!

22:42.094 --> 22:43.894
Hey, Matisse.
Hey, girls.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.963
Hi.
Do you like my Princess basket?

22:45.997 --> 22:48.632
Wow, it's great.
It's super-princessy.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.335
- It's really different.
- Thanks.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.604
What about yours, Alex?

22:53.638 --> 22:57.208
Mine's not really ready
for public display yet.

22:57.242 --> 23:00.111
Really? Well, I guess
I'll just have to come back

23:00.145 --> 23:01.746
and check on your work.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.081
See you later, girls.
Bye, Matisse.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.253
Excuse me, bees.

23:16.361 --> 23:18.562
<i>Moses roses, nothing
says I'm sorry like flowers.</i>

23:18.597 --> 23:20.331
- Mr. Moses?
- <i>That's me.</i>

23:20.365 --> 23:22.400
- Yeah, it's Alex.
- <i>Oh, hi, Alex.</i>

23:22.434 --> 23:24.068
Uh, you make baskets, right?

23:28.273 --> 23:31.342
Mother, do I have to
use the flowers too?

23:31.376 --> 23:33.978
Of course, Gemma.
Three of each color flower.

23:34.012 --> 23:35.679
Follow the directions.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.248
It's not fun at all.

23:37.282 --> 23:39.850
Why can't we do it
like they're doing it?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.963
Here you go, son.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.834
Thank you, sir.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.641
Ah, I don't believe we've met.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.979
Alex Pearson,
junior helper, troop... 57.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.748
Oh-ho-ho, well,

24:10.782 --> 24:12.783
now I understand.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.819
The lack of leadership

24:14.853 --> 24:17.288
explains these...

24:17.322 --> 24:18.989
whatever they are.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.925
Well, troop 57's baskets

24:20.959 --> 24:23.227
are a little different
than the other girls,

24:23.261 --> 24:25.629
but I told them they can
make them however they want.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.998
After all, it's like
everyone's going to want to buy

24:28.033 --> 24:29.600
the same kind of basket, right?

24:30.669 --> 24:32.236
Wrong.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.071
Everyone does want
the same kind of basket.

24:34.105 --> 24:37.174
They want perfect,
beautiful baskets.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.742
Okay, well,

24:38.777 --> 24:42.313
let's just say that troop 57's
baskets are a little different.

24:42.347 --> 24:43.714
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.951
Let's not say that because
there is no troop 57.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.521
With Mrs. moffat gone,
you do not exist.

24:51.623 --> 24:52.890
What?

24:52.924 --> 24:55.493
No offense, ma'am,
but there is a troop 57

24:55.527 --> 24:57.461
and we're them.

24:59.464 --> 25:02.666
Well, I'm not going to argue
with you because I'm right.

25:02.701 --> 25:05.269
The Bumblebee charter
clearly dictates

25:05.303 --> 25:07.037
that every troop's
den mother be present.

25:07.072 --> 25:09.840
And at this time,
I'm afraid...
oh, no, hold on.

25:09.875 --> 25:12.142
And you just assume that
we don't have a den mother

25:12.177 --> 25:14.245
'cause you don't
see a den mother?

25:14.279 --> 25:16.881
Oh oh... we have a den mother.

25:16.915 --> 25:19.116
I don't see a den mother.

25:19.150 --> 25:22.953
Well, maybe that's because
our den mother Mrs. zamboni

25:22.988 --> 25:24.288
- is at home. She's sick.
- What?

25:24.322 --> 25:27.124
She has strep throat.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.693
All right, fine.
Tell Mrs. zamboni

25:29.728 --> 25:32.162
that I look forward
to meeting her at the next

25:32.197 --> 25:33.864
Bumblebee group meeting

25:33.899 --> 25:36.367
and I hope
she feels better soon.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.737
Of course.

25:44.075 --> 25:45.442
I'm onto you.

25:49.481 --> 25:50.948
What was that all about?

25:50.982 --> 25:52.583
I thought you were about
to start hitting each other.

25:52.617 --> 25:54.752
Well, she did start it.

25:54.786 --> 25:57.221
Alex, this isn't a hockey rink.

25:57.255 --> 26:00.691
You have to be more Bumblebee.

26:00.725 --> 26:03.494
I mean, have some
Bumblebee pride.

26:09.801 --> 26:12.503
Now, is this
Bumblebee enough for you?

26:13.705 --> 26:15.406
Wow, Alex,

26:15.440 --> 26:16.907
it... it's beautiful.

26:16.942 --> 26:19.310
I don't know what to say.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.111
I'm really impressed.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.614
I'll go put this
with the finished baskets.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.890
When did we get
a den mother, Alex?

26:32.924 --> 26:35.059
There is
no Mrs. zamboni, dingbat.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.627
He made that all up.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.596
Well, we're doomed now.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.130
It's just a matter of time.

26:40.165 --> 26:43.634
Relax, girls. I'll find you
a replacement den mother.

26:44.903 --> 26:46.370
And in the meantime,

26:46.404 --> 26:48.272
you do have a den mom.

26:48.306 --> 26:50.074
Who?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.443
You have me.

27:06.941 --> 27:09.176
Coach, I am impressed.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.079
When you're in my store, Alex,

27:12.113 --> 27:13.614
I'm not the coach.

27:13.648 --> 27:15.449
I'm just Gary.

27:15.483 --> 27:18.018
Well, Gary, that is the most
perfectly-sharpened hockey skate

27:18.053 --> 27:19.586
I have ever seen.
You are the...

27:21.823 --> 27:23.757
Michelangelo
of skate sharpening.

27:23.792 --> 27:25.426
I'm sorry, Alex.
I can't do it.

27:25.460 --> 27:28.796
What are you talking about?
I can't reinstate you.

27:28.830 --> 27:30.831
Reams has made it pretty clear
this had to be

27:30.865 --> 27:32.933
a serious punishment. You know,
i put you back in now,

27:32.967 --> 27:34.968
he benches the whole team and...

27:37.038 --> 27:38.672
What were you thinking?

27:38.707 --> 27:41.942
You put a patch
for Moses roses on your Jersey.

27:41.976 --> 27:43.510
So what?

27:43.545 --> 27:45.012
Neal reams's family

27:45.046 --> 27:46.513
owns fantasy flowers,

27:46.548 --> 27:48.882
the only other florist in town.

27:50.685 --> 27:53.120
Whoops. Well, how long am i
going to be suspended then?

27:53.154 --> 27:55.022
You know, in theory
it's up to me,

27:55.056 --> 27:58.559
but two weeks at the very least.

27:58.593 --> 28:01.528
I've got to play it by ear
to see when reams cools down.

28:01.563 --> 28:03.163
Two weeks!

28:03.198 --> 28:05.065
Coach, remember all-star team?

28:05.100 --> 28:07.167
I have to be on the ice
to make the all-star team.

28:07.235 --> 28:10.070
Alex, reams isn't just a ref.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.839
He is the all-stars' coach.

28:13.408 --> 28:16.310
It'll take a miracle
to win him over.

28:18.012 --> 28:20.681
Can I help you, miss?

28:20.715 --> 28:23.050
Uh, yeah, camping.
Oh, over here.

28:29.724 --> 28:32.993
Oh, thank you. Oh, it's you.

28:33.027 --> 28:34.528
Guilty as charged.

28:34.562 --> 28:36.296
Well, I bet you
know why I'm here.

28:37.665 --> 28:39.166
Yes, of course I do.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.836
Don't want to wait till the last
minute to prep for camporee.

28:44.873 --> 28:47.474
Absolutely not, that would be
plain irresponsible.

28:47.509 --> 28:50.978
I am an early camporee
preparer for sure.

28:51.012 --> 28:52.479
Me too.

28:53.915 --> 28:55.916
So, Matisse,

28:55.950 --> 28:57.651
I was just wondering
if maybe you and i...

28:57.685 --> 29:00.053
Oh, I see where this is going.

29:00.088 --> 29:02.055
And the answer is yes.

29:02.090 --> 29:04.591
Really? That's...

29:04.626 --> 29:05.626
That's great!

29:05.660 --> 29:07.361
Right on!

29:07.395 --> 29:09.496
It's not a big deal,
it's just a ride.

29:09.531 --> 29:11.098
What?

29:11.132 --> 29:14.935
You wanted a ride
to the Bumblebee
leadership powwow, right?

29:14.969 --> 29:16.503
Yes. That's right.

29:16.538 --> 29:18.105
That's... that is exactly

29:18.139 --> 29:20.474
what I was
going to ask you about.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.176
Cool.

29:27.649 --> 29:30.117
Alex, wait!
What is it, munchkin?

29:30.151 --> 29:31.985
We need you for the meeting.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.387
Oh, no.
Wait, I already waved

29:33.421 --> 29:35.355
at all your parents.
What else do you need me for?

29:35.390 --> 29:37.624
But you're our den mother.
Yes, I know that,

29:37.659 --> 29:39.760
but I have a previous engagement

29:39.794 --> 29:41.728
and... and it's
not like you're alone.

29:41.763 --> 29:43.630
Ingrid is here.

29:46.334 --> 29:48.068
But a Bumblebee's word
is her vow,

29:48.102 --> 29:49.570
especially a den mother.

29:51.072 --> 29:53.740
All right, let's say
that I'm your den... brother.

29:53.775 --> 29:55.776
Uh, and a den brother

29:55.810 --> 29:58.979
is more of a big picture
type of leader.

29:59.013 --> 30:00.714
What?
Huh?

30:03.084 --> 30:04.918
Mmm, where do you
think you're going?

30:06.821 --> 30:08.856
The library.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.758
You even look at my schedule?

30:11.793 --> 30:14.161
It's on the refrigerator.

30:14.195 --> 30:16.063
I will make
a point to from now on.

30:16.097 --> 30:18.198
No, no, no.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.400
I have got office hours
all this weekend.

30:20.435 --> 30:21.902
You have to watch Emily.

30:21.936 --> 30:23.403
No, dad...
No, no.

30:23.438 --> 30:25.138
Plus, you wouldn't be able
to get out of here anyway,

30:25.173 --> 30:27.074
not with all of these
you have to do, right?

30:27.108 --> 30:28.609
Look, if you're serious
about that car,

30:28.643 --> 30:30.177
you've got to work
for it, right?

30:30.211 --> 30:31.945
I have been.
I know, I know.

30:31.980 --> 30:33.814
And I appreciate you
taking Emily

30:33.848 --> 30:36.283
to her Bumblebee meetings,
but I am not looking

30:36.317 --> 30:37.818
for blind obedience,

30:37.852 --> 30:39.353
I'm looking for change here.

30:39.387 --> 30:41.188
I... I do push-ups everyday.

30:42.524 --> 30:44.024
I'm talking about
your attitude, Alex.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.095
Do the chores

30:48.129 --> 30:49.630
and do them right.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.575
Well, I have to at least look
like I'm trying to do some of it

31:01.609 --> 31:04.444
- or I'll never see that car.
- <i>What you really need is a bunch of magical elves</i>

31:04.479 --> 31:06.547
<i>to do the job for you.</i>

31:08.349 --> 31:09.850
Or some worker bees.

31:16.391 --> 31:18.091
All right, all right, you win.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.993
I'll help you girls out
with your go-for-it,

31:20.028 --> 31:21.528
but just this once.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.263
That's all right.
We found one.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.799
We're going to make birdfeeders
out of recycled milk cartons!

31:25.833 --> 31:29.403
Wow, that's great.

31:29.437 --> 31:31.371
I was going to give you one
a little more challenging,

31:31.406 --> 31:35.142
but that birdfeeder idea
seems more your speed.

31:35.176 --> 31:37.244
This go-for-it requires

31:37.278 --> 31:39.413
strength and motor skills.

31:39.447 --> 31:40.847
We can do it.

31:40.882 --> 31:42.649
Mm-hmm.

31:42.684 --> 31:44.484
You... can talk.

31:45.987 --> 31:49.790
Uh, well, since Tina feels
so strongly about this

31:49.824 --> 31:52.192
that she's willing
to make a sound,

31:52.226 --> 31:53.694
I'll give you girls a shot.

31:53.728 --> 31:55.796
Yes! Yes!

put that on pause for a second?

33:29.323 --> 33:31.258
'Sup?
'Sup?

33:31.292 --> 33:33.994
I'll tell you "'sup."

33:34.028 --> 33:35.662
The yard looks...

33:37.365 --> 33:39.633
Magnificent.

33:40.735 --> 33:42.769
Thanks, dad.

33:42.804 --> 33:46.973
It was no sweat.
No, you went above and beyond.

33:47.008 --> 33:49.309
I mean, was it hard
to get that work done

33:49.343 --> 33:51.244
and watch Emily
at the same time?

33:51.279 --> 33:54.114
She was great. She's
actually in the living room

33:54.148 --> 33:56.016
goofing around
with her friends right now.

33:57.552 --> 33:59.086
That's...

34:22.944 --> 34:24.478
What's the big surprise, dad?

34:24.512 --> 34:26.513
Alex, I am proud of you.

34:26.547 --> 34:28.782
Not only have you been
great with Emily,

34:28.815 --> 34:31.717
but you didn't just do the
chores, you took them seriously.

34:31.753 --> 34:33.887
You did the...
The best possible job.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.623
And a deal's a deal.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.358
Wait, are you serious?

34:38.391 --> 34:40.494
Today's the day?

34:40.527 --> 34:42.262
I knew you'd shape up, son.

34:42.295 --> 34:44.097
I keep telling you,
you're a good kid.

34:44.132 --> 34:48.034
Dad, this... this is amazing.
You're the best.

34:48.069 --> 34:50.036
What do you think?

34:52.139 --> 34:53.706
It's pretty awesome, huh?

35:01.783 --> 35:04.084
That's quite a car.
Yeah.

35:04.118 --> 35:06.520
Uh, not that it's
not a great car, but...

35:07.655 --> 35:09.289
Oh! Shoo! Oh!

35:12.527 --> 35:16.163
But I was thinking
of one with a whole engine.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.564
Oh, don't worry about it.

35:17.598 --> 35:19.733
The rest of the engine's
in the trunk.

35:19.767 --> 35:22.836
This is the best way for
a young man to learn about cars.

35:22.870 --> 35:24.971
By building one?
Yeah. Yes.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.540
That's how I learned.

35:26.574 --> 35:28.441
I tell you,
the car granddad got me

35:28.476 --> 35:30.544
makes this one look
like an Italian sports car.

35:30.578 --> 35:32.045
Fixing up one of these

35:32.079 --> 35:34.214
is like being thrown
into the deep end of a pool.

35:35.349 --> 35:38.351
Well, thanks, dad.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.453
You know, son,
i have been selling you short.

35:40.488 --> 35:43.089
You show that
you're capable of much more

35:43.124 --> 35:46.293
and so here is a list of chores

35:46.327 --> 35:48.361
more in keeping
with your abilities.

35:59.674 --> 36:02.742
No.
What do you mean "no"?

36:02.777 --> 36:05.478
We don't want to do
another go-for-it.

36:05.513 --> 36:08.315
Especially
a clean-the-gutter go-for-it.

36:08.349 --> 36:10.817
Why not?
First of all, it sounds hard

36:10.852 --> 36:12.352
and not at all fun.

36:12.386 --> 36:15.689
And second of all, we have
more important things to do.

36:15.723 --> 36:19.259
Like what?
Like earn badges, Alex.

36:19.293 --> 36:20.994
We need them for camporee.

36:21.028 --> 36:22.588
And we're super-behind
the other troops.

36:24.165 --> 36:25.732
Oh, uh, badges!

36:25.766 --> 36:27.767
I... I didn't know
we were ready for that.

36:27.802 --> 36:29.536
Where do we...
Where do we start?

36:30.538 --> 36:32.772
The build-a-fire badge is first.

36:32.807 --> 36:34.567
Can you teach us?
Of course, I can teach you.

36:37.011 --> 36:39.279
Only problem is that
we're not zoned for that,

36:39.313 --> 36:41.314
which means
we'd have to take a bus

36:41.349 --> 36:44.584
to a campground or something
which is fine with me, but...

36:44.619 --> 36:46.219
But?

36:46.254 --> 36:48.255
Well, that'll just
cut into our badge time.

36:48.289 --> 36:51.925
You girls could earn four badges
in the amount of time

36:51.959 --> 36:54.928
it would take to earn one
lame build-a-fire badge.

36:54.962 --> 36:57.397
But that's cool. We can do that.

36:57.431 --> 36:59.532
No no no, wait,
did you say four badges?

37:43.744 --> 37:47.414
The internal combustion engine
is a miracle of modern science.

37:47.448 --> 37:49.649
But after you complete
this task, you will know

37:49.684 --> 37:51.451
more about it
than most Americans do.

37:51.485 --> 37:54.087
Alex, I'm almost
done with the...

37:54.121 --> 37:57.223
"Cat-ill-attic" converter.
What come next?

37:57.258 --> 37:58.725
Um, why don't you ask Dina?

37:58.759 --> 38:00.593
Why would we ask Dina?

38:00.628 --> 38:02.662
Because she's coming up
the sidewalk right now.

38:04.198 --> 38:05.765
What?
She's going to want to speak with zamboni.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.701
What do we do?
Um...

38:07.735 --> 38:11.237
Rachel, go and stall her now,
quickly. And everyone else,

38:11.272 --> 38:13.073
come inside with me! Quick!

38:14.809 --> 38:18.678
Hello, Bumblebee,
can I see your den mother?

38:18.713 --> 38:20.347
Do you know
the Bumblebee password?

38:20.381 --> 38:23.083
Bumblebee pass... uh...

38:23.117 --> 38:26.453
Let me see now, I think...
oh, "integrity."
Wrong.

38:30.358 --> 38:31.858
Oh, "fidelity."
Nope.

38:40.468 --> 38:42.469
There is no Bumblebee password.

38:42.503 --> 38:43.837
You're right.

38:43.871 --> 38:46.439
Only a real Bumblebee
would know that.

38:51.512 --> 38:53.279
Right this way.

38:53.314 --> 38:54.981
Oh!

38:57.084 --> 38:58.785
Are you Mrs. zamboni?

38:58.819 --> 39:00.687
Uh...

39:00.721 --> 39:05.392
Yes. Yes.
Yes, that's me... Mrs. z.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.127
You must be Dina.

39:07.161 --> 39:09.229
You're just as lovely
as Alex said you were.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.965
That's... you can't see me.

39:11.999 --> 39:15.068
Oh, no, I can't,
but I'd recognize

39:15.102 --> 39:16.836
that lovely voice anywhere.

39:16.871 --> 39:18.905
What's wrong with your voice?
It's quite low.

39:18.939 --> 39:21.474
Oh, uh, just...
Just a little cold

39:21.509 --> 39:23.410
nothing to be worried about.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.445
Probably not contagious...

39:25.479 --> 39:27.347
I hope.

39:27.381 --> 39:29.182
Mrs. zamboni,

39:29.216 --> 39:32.986
what exactly
is going on around here?

39:33.020 --> 39:35.221
Uh, well, we're having

39:35.256 --> 39:38.058
a home spa go-for-it.

39:38.092 --> 39:39.492
Is that salad dressing?

39:39.527 --> 39:41.127
Yes, it is.

39:41.162 --> 39:43.897
It's great for my complexion.
I have terribly dry skin.

39:43.931 --> 39:46.633
Would you like to try some?
It's supposed to work wonders

39:46.667 --> 39:48.435
on reptilian skin.

39:50.237 --> 39:52.439
Mrs. zamboni,
with all due respect,

39:52.473 --> 39:54.140
I don't think
this is the kind of skill

39:54.175 --> 39:56.709
we should be teaching children...
I agree, I agree,

39:56.744 --> 39:58.278
but... but the children insisted.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.613
Why don't you sit down?

40:00.648 --> 40:02.549
Uh... oh.

40:02.583 --> 40:05.518
Will you be attending
the Bumblebee leadership powwow

40:05.553 --> 40:06.986
this Thursday?

40:07.021 --> 40:08.981
Oh, dear, I'll... I'll try,
but with this cough...

40:10.458 --> 40:12.459
my junior helper, bless him,

40:12.493 --> 40:14.027
will be attending in my place.

40:14.061 --> 40:16.830
That nice Matisse burroughs
is going to be taking him.

40:16.864 --> 40:20.166
Mrs. z, I hate to be a stickler
for the rules, but...

40:20.201 --> 40:21.968
Oh!
Cucumbers?

40:22.002 --> 40:23.736
Thank you so much, bumblebees,

40:23.771 --> 40:26.706
but I am afraid I have to dash.

40:27.708 --> 40:29.175
Toledo, Dina!

40:29.210 --> 40:30.877
And one last thing,
Mrs. zamboni.

40:30.911 --> 40:34.114
Watch Alex Pearson closely.

40:34.148 --> 40:37.150
I don't trust him.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.352
Don't trust Alex?

40:39.386 --> 40:41.121
Why, that's absurd.

40:41.155 --> 40:43.990
The sweet lad is as honest
as the day is long

40:44.024 --> 40:47.927
or my name isn't
edna may zamboni.

40:51.532 --> 40:53.032
All right.

40:53.067 --> 40:55.835
That was so disgusting.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.338
What?
You have a date

40:58.372 --> 41:00.540
with Matisse burroughs
and you didn't think it worth

41:00.574 --> 41:02.308
mentioning to me?

41:02.343 --> 41:03.943
Well, it's not really a date.

41:03.978 --> 41:06.446
Are you two going together?

41:06.480 --> 41:07.981
Then it's a date!

41:08.015 --> 41:10.116
You guys! Alex got
a date with Matisse

41:10.151 --> 41:12.485
and we only have till Thursday.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.454
What do we do?
It's not enough time.

41:14.488 --> 41:16.189
She's way out of his league.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.724
No, wait...

41:17.758 --> 41:20.493
No, I don't need
any dating advice from...

41:20.528 --> 41:23.496
Alex, you know a lot
about hockey, right?

41:23.531 --> 41:25.999
Well, we know a lot about girls.

41:26.033 --> 41:28.001
Now, keeping in mind about

41:28.035 --> 41:29.569
what Matisse thought of you

41:29.603 --> 41:31.704
up until now,

41:31.739 --> 41:34.174
will you let us help you?

41:37.711 --> 41:39.312
Good answer.

41:39.346 --> 41:40.680
Alex, stay still.

41:41.715 --> 41:43.149
Ow.

41:43.184 --> 41:44.651
Ewww.

41:46.153 --> 41:47.921
No, no... what are you doing?

41:47.955 --> 41:50.990
We have to vamp your hair.
You have to what my hair?

41:51.025 --> 41:53.193
Look at this, Alex.
See these cute boys?

41:53.227 --> 41:54.594
They're superstars.

41:54.628 --> 41:56.296
And they either play
vampires on the screen

41:56.330 --> 41:57.797
or rock the vampire hair.

41:57.831 --> 41:59.999
Okay, go.

42:00.034 --> 42:01.968
What are you
going to talk about?

42:02.002 --> 42:04.771
Um, I know this.

42:04.805 --> 42:07.907
Her! You're
going to talk about her.

42:07.942 --> 42:11.144
Okay.
Emily, Rachel wants
to dress him like a biker.

42:11.178 --> 42:13.079
This is so cool.

42:13.113 --> 42:15.081
All right, well,
let's take a vote.

42:16.317 --> 42:18.251
All right, everybody,
biker shirt?

42:19.787 --> 42:22.789
Okay, uh, cute boy shirt.

42:24.758 --> 42:25.992
Cute boy shirt it is.

42:26.026 --> 42:27.694
- Do I get a vote?
- No.

42:29.330 --> 42:30.964
Oh, my gosh, you guys,
we have to go!

42:30.998 --> 42:32.599
Get going!
This will have to do. Hurry!

42:32.633 --> 42:34.234
Wait wait wait!
No, hold on! Hold on!

42:34.268 --> 42:36.536
She's picking me up, it's fine.
No, not anymore!

42:36.570 --> 42:38.171
Let's get going!

42:38.205 --> 42:40.640
Go go go! Go!

42:40.674 --> 42:41.975
Wait wait. Wait wait.

42:42.009 --> 42:43.676
Whoa! Whoa whoa.

42:43.711 --> 42:45.311
What? What what?

42:49.683 --> 42:51.918
My dad owns
a custom auto paint shop.

42:51.952 --> 42:55.555
Have fun.
And open her car door.

43:21.815 --> 43:23.883
Beautiful car, Alex.

43:23.917 --> 43:27.987
Mrs. jacklitz, you have
a very light footstep.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.489
Ninja.

43:30.824 --> 43:33.226
You bumblebees did
a great job on your wheels.

43:33.260 --> 43:35.194
They are very diligent.

43:35.229 --> 43:36.796
It's part of their code.

43:36.830 --> 43:39.866
Just like integrity,
fidelity and readiness?

43:41.101 --> 43:43.569
You know,

43:43.604 --> 43:46.572
the code also applies
to den mothers.

43:49.076 --> 43:51.944
Interesting
little trivia tidbit,

43:51.979 --> 43:54.113
Mrs. j, but if you'll excuse me,

43:54.148 --> 43:56.316
I have something
i have to be doing.

44:07.528 --> 44:09.729
Thanks for driving.

44:09.763 --> 44:11.431
I love your new look.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.701
Oh, yeah, the hair, uh...

44:14.735 --> 44:16.836
Emily and her friends did it.

44:16.870 --> 44:19.172
I know they kind of went
a little overboard.

44:19.206 --> 44:20.707
No no no, it's cute.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.076
It's, uh... it's even cuter
that you let them do it.

44:23.110 --> 44:25.411
Um, here, let me.

44:50.971 --> 44:53.673
So, were you a Bumblebee?

44:53.707 --> 44:55.808
Oh, um, yeah.

44:56.944 --> 44:58.811
I know it's kind of dorky,
but um,

44:58.846 --> 45:00.380
I love this stuff.

45:00.414 --> 45:03.282
And um, you know, I think
it's really great for girls.

45:03.317 --> 45:05.385
That's... that's why I didn't
want lorna to miss out

45:05.419 --> 45:07.587
just... just because
our mom was busy.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.088
Yeah.

45:09.123 --> 45:11.363
I think it's wonderful of you
to do this for your sister.

45:13.160 --> 45:16.562
Yeah, well, Emily shouldn't
miss out on all the girly stuff

45:16.597 --> 45:18.131
just because...

45:18.165 --> 45:21.267
We lost our mom.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.503
And it's not like
i had to join the army

45:23.537 --> 45:25.438
or anything, right?

45:25.472 --> 45:27.173
Troop 22.

45:27.207 --> 45:29.242
1,700 boxes.

45:29.276 --> 45:31.377
Ooh.

45:31.412 --> 45:32.979
Troop 71.

45:33.013 --> 45:34.614
2,200.

45:34.648 --> 45:37.450
Oh, ladies, ladies,

45:37.484 --> 45:40.319
ladies, ladies, ladies.

45:40.354 --> 45:44.190
Do you see these?
The only way to get
a golden badge

45:44.224 --> 45:46.225
is by being the champion troop

45:46.260 --> 45:48.261
of camporee.

45:48.295 --> 45:50.296
But you're never even
going to have the opportunity

45:50.330 --> 45:51.998
to lose to my troop

45:52.032 --> 45:54.734
if you don't sell enough
cookies to attend.

45:54.768 --> 45:56.903
Troop 18.

45:56.937 --> 45:58.438
Uh, 3,000.

45:58.472 --> 46:00.473
Not bad, Matisse.

46:00.507 --> 46:02.909
You're halfway
to my troop's total.

46:04.545 --> 46:06.212
So far.

46:06.246 --> 46:08.781
Troop 57.

46:10.517 --> 46:12.485
Uh, I don't...

46:12.519 --> 46:13.986
I don't have the exact figures.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.788
That... that's Mrs. zamboni

46:15.823 --> 46:17.890
and she's at home, she's sick

46:17.925 --> 46:19.859
with a case of the gretzskys.

46:21.562 --> 46:23.496
Well, I hope
that clears up quickly.

46:23.530 --> 46:25.998
Could you just give me
an approximate number?

46:27.234 --> 46:29.302
I sense that our troop
is slightly behind.

46:29.336 --> 46:30.803
Of course.

46:30.838 --> 46:32.872
But we're doing a big
push at the mall this Saturday.

46:32.906 --> 46:34.740
Excuse me?

46:34.775 --> 46:37.143
Uh, troop 66 sells at the mall.

46:37.177 --> 46:40.079
- Just Dina's troop? Why?
- It's just tradition.

46:40.113 --> 46:41.581
That's bogus.

46:41.615 --> 46:44.784
Junior helper,
did you just say something?

46:46.887 --> 46:49.388
No, sorry den mother Dina.

46:50.824 --> 46:53.059
But... but don't
the Bumblebee girls

46:53.093 --> 46:55.661
represent America?

46:55.696 --> 46:57.463
And didn't...
Didn't the pilgrims come

46:57.498 --> 46:59.999
to this great nation so that
king George couldn't tell them

47:00.033 --> 47:03.069
which mall they could
or couldn't sell
their cookies at?

47:04.838 --> 47:08.174
I move to say
that Dina's mall monopoly

47:08.208 --> 47:10.243
is un-American.

47:10.277 --> 47:12.445
You know, I mean,
if all the troops

47:12.479 --> 47:14.614
sell at the mall,
it will be pandemonium,

47:14.648 --> 47:16.282
junior helper.

47:16.316 --> 47:17.783
But why does
troop 66 get the gravy?

47:17.818 --> 47:21.454
Why? We should have
a contest to see who
gets the mall concession.

47:21.488 --> 47:23.923
Yeah, whoever wants to sell
at the mall on Saturday can.

47:24.958 --> 47:27.293
Yes, just a...
A cookie blitz if you will.

47:28.662 --> 47:30.196
And whichever troop
sells the most cookies,

47:30.230 --> 47:32.532
gets the mall
for the rest of the season.

47:32.566 --> 47:34.100
All in favor

47:34.134 --> 47:36.869
of a cookie blitz say "aye."

47:36.904 --> 47:38.604
Aye!

47:38.639 --> 47:40.139
All opposed.

47:45.846 --> 47:48.214
Well, um, good night.

47:48.248 --> 47:49.715
Thanks for the ride

47:49.750 --> 47:51.817
and the hair show.

47:51.852 --> 47:53.719
No problemo.

47:57.424 --> 48:01.193
What you did tonight was great.

48:03.163 --> 48:05.665
You made a stand for all
the den moms who have been

48:05.699 --> 48:07.433
too terrified
to stand up to Dina

48:07.467 --> 48:09.001
for years.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.472
I was wrong about you.

48:14.675 --> 48:16.342
Emily's lucky to have you
for a brother.

48:30.874 --> 48:32.408
[Woman see you.

48:32.442 --> 48:34.176
Bye. See you later.

48:35.279 --> 48:37.380
Bees!

48:38.482 --> 48:39.982
All right.

48:46.323 --> 48:48.758
Okay, 57, this operation

48:48.792 --> 48:50.927
separates the men
from the babies...

48:52.596 --> 48:54.964
From the bumblebees.

48:54.998 --> 48:57.033
You know what to do,
so get in there...

48:57.067 --> 48:58.768
Em, what are you doing?

48:58.802 --> 49:01.270
I thought I should look more
like a real Bumblebee girl.

49:02.506 --> 49:03.973
No. No, no.

49:04.007 --> 49:07.243
You are a real Bumblebee girl

49:07.277 --> 49:09.178
and a Princess

49:09.212 --> 49:11.280
and a vampire

49:11.315 --> 49:12.915
and... and whatever
you want to be,

49:12.950 --> 49:15.451
but you guys know what to do.

49:15.485 --> 49:18.321
So get in there, be yourselves,

49:18.355 --> 49:20.656
and sell some cookies.

50:40.337 --> 50:41.771
You are so wrong.

50:41.805 --> 50:43.739
Peanut butter beauts
are too die for.

50:43.774 --> 50:46.709
I would like a word
with your Mrs. zamboni.

50:46.743 --> 50:49.311
Uh, she's not here.

50:49.346 --> 50:50.980
Not here, is she?

50:51.014 --> 50:52.681
Bumblebee bylaws clearly dictate
the den mother

50:52.716 --> 50:55.051
must be present. I'm afraid
your troop is officially dis...

50:55.085 --> 50:56.719
No, no, no.
I just meant

50:56.753 --> 50:59.355
she's not here right now.

51:01.792 --> 51:03.692
She's in the mall, obviously.

51:03.727 --> 51:06.095
Oh. Well, where?

51:07.697 --> 51:09.432
She's just taking advantage

51:09.466 --> 51:11.500
of the 50%-off
all control-top jeans

51:11.535 --> 51:13.469
at big beautiful you, you know?

51:13.503 --> 51:15.404
A sale's going on.

51:15.439 --> 51:18.607
I'm sure she'll be back soon.
Well, I don't think
i care to wait.

51:18.642 --> 51:20.810
I'd better sell
a couple of these myself.

51:55.912 --> 51:57.613
Excuse me.

51:59.416 --> 52:02.118
Oh, darn, these are...
These are quite tight.

52:02.152 --> 52:04.353
If I can just...
I can just...

52:04.387 --> 52:06.755
Mrs. zamboni?

52:06.790 --> 52:09.158
Oh, yes? Is that you Dina?

52:12.496 --> 52:14.597
Oh, that one was
way too small for me.

52:14.631 --> 52:16.298
Don't you just love this store?

52:16.333 --> 52:17.900
I don't shop here.

52:17.934 --> 52:20.169
Oh, there's nothing to be
embarrassed about, dear.

52:20.203 --> 52:23.472
Big-boned gals
need pretty frocks too.

52:25.075 --> 52:26.842
That one was the wrong color
for my complexion.

52:26.877 --> 52:28.444
Listen, don't you feel
that you should be

52:28.478 --> 52:30.179
out there with your bees
making sure that they're

52:30.213 --> 52:33.282
in uniform, things like that?

52:33.316 --> 52:36.218
Don't you think you should be
out there with your girls, dear?

52:36.253 --> 52:38.687
Maybe if you spent more time
encouraging them

52:38.722 --> 52:42.224
and less time
obsessing about us...

52:43.627 --> 52:45.127
We wouldn't be handing
you your bottoms

52:45.162 --> 52:48.731
on a silver platter in this
cookie race, now would we?

52:48.765 --> 52:52.134
You will be sorry
you said that, Mrs. zamboni.

52:53.170 --> 52:55.204
Just keeping it real, dawg,

52:55.238 --> 52:57.239
as the kids say.

52:57.274 --> 52:59.008
Did you find Mrs. zamboni?

52:59.042 --> 53:00.543
Unfortunately, yes.

53:01.845 --> 53:04.914
Uh, Mrs. zamboni?

53:04.948 --> 53:07.082
I'm Matisse burroughs.

53:07.117 --> 53:09.385
Uh... uh... uh...

53:09.419 --> 53:11.220
Oh, Matisse.

53:11.254 --> 53:14.723
Yeah, Alex talks about you
all the time. How lovely.

53:14.758 --> 53:17.693
I... I feel like
i know you and... and if I've...

53:17.727 --> 53:20.196
If I wasn't

53:20.230 --> 53:23.699
dealing with this
slim fit body-shaper,

53:23.733 --> 53:27.203
I'd come right out there
and give you a great big hug.

53:27.237 --> 53:29.004
Alex... Alex talks about me?

53:29.039 --> 53:30.472
Oh... oh, yes.

53:30.507 --> 53:32.041
What a lovely lad.

53:32.075 --> 53:34.843
If it wasn't for him
begging me on bended knee,

53:34.878 --> 53:37.546
troop 57 wouldn't even
have a den mother.

53:38.882 --> 53:41.116
Really?
Yes.

53:41.151 --> 53:44.320
And... and any girl should
consider themselves lucky

53:44.354 --> 53:47.223
to be Alex Pearson's girlfriend.

53:47.290 --> 53:51.160
Uh, well, I'd better
get back to my sister.

53:51.194 --> 53:53.996
See you.

54:02.872 --> 54:04.506
We won! Alex, we won!

54:04.541 --> 54:06.342
We won! We won!

54:06.376 --> 54:08.010
Oh, wow! That's great!

54:08.044 --> 54:09.545
I knew you girls could do it.

54:09.579 --> 54:11.780
- High-fives all around.
- Bzzzz!

54:13.049 --> 54:14.883
And if we can win here,
we can win anywhere!

54:14.918 --> 54:17.119
We'll keep selling these cookies
until we get to camporee!

54:17.153 --> 54:19.455
Yay!

54:20.690 --> 54:22.291
What are those supposed to be?

54:25.762 --> 54:27.196
My badges.

54:27.230 --> 54:28.831
Wow.

54:28.865 --> 54:31.267
Did you guys
make them yourselves?

54:33.970 --> 54:35.704
Look, they all have them.

54:36.906 --> 54:39.575
Well, well, well.

54:39.609 --> 54:42.077
It looks like your junior helper

54:42.112 --> 54:44.780
has been playing
a little trick on you, 57s.

54:44.814 --> 54:46.415
No, they're... they're
independent study badges.

54:46.449 --> 54:47.983
They count. Look it up.

54:48.018 --> 54:51.253
Alex, not all the badges
can be individualized,

54:51.288 --> 54:52.755
just one or two.

54:52.789 --> 54:54.623
What's this one for?

54:54.658 --> 54:59.061
I, um, made Alex
and his friends sandwiches.

55:01.131 --> 55:04.833
Bumblebees?
More like wanna-bees?

55:06.870 --> 55:10.306
What did you do for this one,
clean your brother's room?

55:11.341 --> 55:13.275
Now girls, we mustn't giggle.

55:13.310 --> 55:17.413
Oh, I am so sorry for you, 57s,

55:17.447 --> 55:19.481
but qualifying for camporee

55:19.516 --> 55:21.517
is more than
just selling cookies.

55:22.752 --> 55:24.453
These badges will not count

55:24.487 --> 55:26.789
toward your eligibility.

55:26.823 --> 55:29.625
Too bad there's
no gullibility badge.

55:32.629 --> 55:34.530
Oh, my.
Come on, my little ones.

55:34.564 --> 55:36.131
This is wonderful.

55:38.435 --> 55:40.869
How could you?
I can't believe for one second

55:40.904 --> 55:43.038
that I actually...

55:43.073 --> 55:44.440
No, no, no, ma...

55:47.577 --> 55:50.279
Uh, em, girls, come on.
We're going.

55:51.614 --> 55:53.415
Come on.

56:06.863 --> 56:09.631
Hey. I thought
i saw you out here.

56:09.666 --> 56:11.266
Good game, goose.

56:11.301 --> 56:12.835
Yeah. Yeah, fourth win in a row.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.404
Yeah, lady luck is really

56:15.438 --> 56:17.072
shining down on you guys.

56:18.708 --> 56:20.209
Yeah.

56:20.243 --> 56:21.777
Whatever.

56:21.811 --> 56:23.379
Anyway, you came
to watch us play.

56:23.413 --> 56:25.447
That means a lot.

56:26.549 --> 56:28.517
Emily hates me.

56:28.551 --> 56:30.185
No.
Yeah.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.321
A bunch of the other bumblebees

56:32.355 --> 56:34.556
made fun of the badges
i made for the girls

56:34.591 --> 56:36.692
and now they're
all bent out of shape.

56:36.726 --> 56:38.293
I see.

56:39.529 --> 56:41.597
So, you didn't come here
to cheer on the team,

56:41.631 --> 56:43.298
you came here for you.

56:45.201 --> 56:48.370
Don't you think that just
maybe that's your problem?

56:51.841 --> 56:54.143
The problem is that...

56:54.177 --> 56:56.378
Well, aside from the fact
that Emily being mad at me

56:56.413 --> 56:57.913
makes it a drag to watch her,

56:57.947 --> 57:01.150
Matisse... Matisse thinks this
whole losing camporee thing

57:01.184 --> 57:02.851
is... is my fault.

57:02.886 --> 57:05.020
It is your fault.
It's totally your fault.

57:08.658 --> 57:11.627
You're absolutely right.
I've got to fix this.

57:11.661 --> 57:13.328
I...

57:13.363 --> 57:16.165
I've got to look like
I'm trying to fix this, right?

57:16.199 --> 57:17.966
Because if I don't,

57:18.001 --> 57:19.802
Emily's always going
to be mad at me forever

57:19.836 --> 57:21.670
and Matisse won't date me.
No. Alex, that's not...

57:21.704 --> 57:22.971
When you're right, you're right.

57:23.006 --> 57:25.507
And you're right.
Alex, no, you're...

57:25.542 --> 57:27.276
Alex, you're missing the point.

57:30.046 --> 57:31.413
Hey.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.288
All right, guys,
let's review what we agreed on

57:33.316 --> 57:35.751
in the Bumblebee
chatroom last night.

57:35.785 --> 57:38.053
Nobody is going to
talk to Alex, right?

57:38.087 --> 57:39.755
Right. We need to be mean,

57:39.789 --> 57:41.924
but not too mean
because we still need him.

57:41.958 --> 57:45.093
I can't believe I have
an organize-Alex's-closet badge.

57:45.128 --> 57:47.396
Hey, guys, look at this.

57:50.934 --> 57:54.169
Binoculars and a map?

57:56.339 --> 57:57.840
I smell a rat.

57:57.874 --> 57:59.441
I have a rat.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.376
This smells way more
like your brother.

58:01.411 --> 58:03.745
Come on, let's go.

58:10.420 --> 58:11.920
That way.
That way.

58:11.955 --> 58:13.455
Okay.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.014
I see Alex.

58:40.316 --> 58:41.817
You guys, right there.

58:46.422 --> 58:48.924
Congratulations, you have all
now officially earned

58:48.958 --> 58:51.627
you orienteering badges.

58:51.661 --> 58:53.762
Here you go, em. Girls.

58:56.766 --> 58:58.967
Nice trick, Alex.
It still doesn't

58:59.002 --> 59:01.069
make up for what you did.

59:01.104 --> 59:03.372
I'm sorry about that.

59:03.406 --> 59:05.440
I... I really am.

59:05.475 --> 59:08.443
But... but you still need five
more badges for camporee.

59:08.478 --> 59:10.913
I... I dug up all the stuff you
need and I brought it here.

59:10.947 --> 59:13.115
So, what do you say?

59:15.418 --> 59:17.452
Two! Three!

59:20.156 --> 59:22.658
Five! Six!

59:22.692 --> 59:25.294
And seven!

59:25.328 --> 59:27.095
And eight!

59:32.001 --> 59:33.869

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.215
<i>♪ walk right

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.250
Wow. Thanks, Alex.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:25.487
I can start a fire.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.423
Yes, you can. And we know

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.058
you're only going to
do that in a fireplace

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.560
or officially
designated campsite,

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:34.796
no unsupervised fires ever.

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.465
- Got it.
- Look, I got another...

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:38.100
Now, the good news
is that troop 57

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:40.135
now has all the required badges

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:41.670
for the skills you'll need

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.305
to compete
in this year's camporee.

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.140
Oh, but hold on!

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.642
The bad news is that we're

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:48.176
a little short
on our cookie sales.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:52.514
Now, the cookie sales
are how we pay for camporee.

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:53.982
Well, how short are we?

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:55.851
Well, it doesn't really
matter how short we are,

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.352
as cookie sales have closed.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.921
Maybe we could sell
something else.

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:01.923
Like our blood!

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.794
Muffins.
Everybody loves muffins.

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:08.230
They're just like cookies,
but with all the packaging.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:09.698
And we can make them ourselves.

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:11.133
Yeah.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.502
We have a big kitchen at my
house. We can make them there.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:16.872
Okay, well, if we baked muffins,
we'd have to sell, like...

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:20.542
415.

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.979
We have to sell 415 muffins?

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.681
Each... for a total

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.783
of $2,075.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:31.153
We can't do that. No one can.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.155
Now, wait a second. You guys
didn't think you could earn

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:35.490
five merit badges
that quickly either, did you?

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.958
No.
Hmm.

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.460
We should at least try.

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.896
Or not.
We can do this.

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:46.268
Now, supposing we do

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:47.769
bake muffins all day,

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:49.671
ideally, we want to find

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.206
a big group of people

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.841
that are all jammed
together or hungry.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.710
And if they were cold,
that would be a bonus

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.511
'cause the muffins would be hot.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.346
Oh, what about
the big hockey game?

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.482
Yeah! That's perfect!

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.217
Don't remind me
of the hockey game.

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.752
If my team
doesn't win this game,

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.454
we don't go to the playoffs

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:07.255
and then I don't get to be
on the all-star team.

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.458
Alex, we should go
to the hockey game.

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.727
Stop. I don't want
to talk about the hockey game!

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:14.362
Now, where can we go
where there's going to be

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.733
a big group of people
who are cold and hungry...

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:26.041
- The hockey game.
- That's right.

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:46.428
The ice rink is so perfect.

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:49.364
The ice hound fans all love you.

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.299
Having you there
will be like a commercial.

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.801
Yeah!

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.238
Em, no one can know
that I'm with you.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.207
Why not?

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:01.743
Are you embarrassed
to be seen with us?

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.815
No. No, no, no.
No, that's...
that's not it at all.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:11.453
I just think that
Mrs. zamboni
should be there.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.722
We're at the ice rink.
We're bound to run
into a den mom or two.

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.257
They might tell Dina.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.092
Maybe we should just pick
another spot.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:20.695
But it's thee best place
to sell our muffins.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:23.565
What if Mrs. zamboni
is there?

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.167
Hmm?
Huh?

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:32.240
This is ridiculous.

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.209
How do you know
how to do this again?

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.544
I love Halloween

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:39.848
like some people
like Christmas or sunlight

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.917
I've been doing
my old witch makeup
for years.

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.285
It's won awards.

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:44.653
But... well, it feels awful.

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:45.754
What is that made out of?

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:47.189
Latex facial appliances,

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.957
just like they use in movies.

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.593
Em, is there any chance
this will actually work?

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.762
Well, it will be
pretty dark out there,

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:56.965
and this is not going to be
a face

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:59.968
that people will want
a closer look at.

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:18.320
Can't believe
Alex wrote it like this.

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:20.689
We're not babies, you know.

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:26.695
Look. Oh, that looks so cute.

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.763
What are you raising money for,
little girl?

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:30.599
Oh, uh...

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:34.469
Oh, uh, we're trying to go
to the camp of bees.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.110
How cute.

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:49.551
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Here you go.

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.653
Hello. Hello.
Here. Yeah.

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:52.821
Sweetheart, hi.

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.789
It's Emily, isn't it?

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:58.293
And I suppose that your troop
is here with your brother?

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.063
Um, well, not exactly.

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:04.332
Really?
So you don't even have

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:07.369
your junior helper
along with you this time.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:10.872
Ooh, I am afraid
the Bumblebee regional office

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.108
will need to be informed
of this final,

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:16.778
and I am afraid fate
will greet you fools.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:22.417
I must report troop 57
is a-w-o-d-m.

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:23.985
A-w-o-d-m?

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.954
Abroad without a den mother.

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:27.622
Headquarters?
Serious situation.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:30.492
It appears
that troop 57's den mother is...

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:33.061
Right here.

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.997
Dina, you have Bumblebee
headquarters

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:37.565
on the speed dial?

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.502
Don't you think that's
a bit extreme, deary?

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:43.939
Mrs. zamboni,
what are you doing here?

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:45.874
Just being a good den mother

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:48.443
and being a loyal supporter.
Go, ice hounds!

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.248
What are you doing here, dear?

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.683
Well, if you must know,

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:57.385
my husband
is required to attend
every game,

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.920
and I just wanted to make sure

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.356
that everything was in order.

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.924
How sweet.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.393
Well, now that you know
everything is "in order,"

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:08.697
why don't you toddle off
and watch the game?

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.303
We have to sell like crazy,

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.404
and we have to spread out.

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:17.872
Just go up to anyone
and be like,

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:20.608
"get your muffins here.
Hey, muffins, muffins,
muffins,"

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.377
or just anything like that.

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:24.946
Oh, like Tina could do that.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:28.183
Maybe I could just
restock everyone else?

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:32.120
Tina, we all do things
that we never dream of doing.

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.155
I, for example,

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.825
I am dressed in public,
as a middle-aged to old

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:39.728
granny type with a pillow

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:42.731
in my control top.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:44.733
And besides that, your
whole troop is counting on you

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:47.902
- Tina, you can do this.
- We believe in you.

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.804
Rachel,

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.140
great job on the makeup.

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:54.009
Thanks.

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.643
Girls.

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.847
You did do a good job.

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:02.751
Fresh muffins! Butter available!

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:12.193
Come on! Where's the "d"?
We're blowing it, guys!

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:14.596
Uh... uh...

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:17.599
I... I mean try harder!

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:21.436
Yo! Hot muffins!
Just $3 for a hunk of heaven!

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.605
Hey, blue hat,

01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:25.840
I got chocolaty
goodness for you!

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.842
Coming in!
Thanks.

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.677
Over here!

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.780
Hey, lady!
I got some tasty oat bran

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:34.049
with your name on it!

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.317
Thanks!
Hey, I'll take a blueberry one!

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.319
Sure thing, sister.

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:40.655
Oh, hey, Matisse.

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.557
Is that you, Tina?

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:44.426
Um, yeah.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.796
I don't know what came over me,
but I kind of like it.

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:51.766
I think I found my summer job.

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:54.169
<i>Minus Alex Pearson,
the ice hounds are tied at 2</i>

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:57.439
<i>and struggling to find a spark
that will lead them to victory.</i>

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.008
<i>Honestly, without Pearson,</i>

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:02.077
<i>I'm shocked we even
got those two.</i>

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:04.012
For the love of pizza!

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:06.047
How can we be losing this game?

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.250
We could be in the playoffs
for the first time in years

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:11.286
if we could just score
a stinking goal.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.021
Why don't you put Alex in?

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.824
Thanks a lot... grandma...

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.658
but he's not here.

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:19.727
And if he were,
i would end the suspension

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.763
and I would
put him in right now.

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:26.701
Done and done.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.645
<i>The ice hounds
are making a substitute</i>

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.381
<i>and sending in...
I'm not sure,</i>

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:42.951
<i>but it appears to be</i>

01:08:42.984 --> 01:08:46.187
<i>one of the player's
grandmothers?</i>

01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.323
Huh?
Alex?

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:50.291
Who is that?

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:51.826
<i>She steals the puck,</i>

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.895
<i>skates around and scores!</i>

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.830
What?

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.532
- Is he crazy?
- <i>Hold your horses.</i>

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.301
<i>That's no ordinary granny!</i>

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:02.569
<i>It's Alex Pearson!</i>

01:09:02.604 --> 01:09:05.540
<i>I should have known
by his silky-smooth moves</i>

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:07.575
<i>and nose for the goal.</i>

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:11.712
<i>Alex, you are one in a million!</i>

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:14.314
<i>Pearson! Pearson! Pearson!</i>

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:17.551
Buddy, what do you think
about that, man? We won!

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:20.688
No, Alex. You won.

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:22.157
You won.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:23.658
Goose!

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.660
Dude, come on, man.

01:09:35.703 --> 01:09:38.540
Emily, i...

01:09:38.573 --> 01:09:40.175
Emily, troop 57, wait!
I didn't...

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.317
I didn't mean to...

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.286
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:01.729
Uh, nothing on
but your dumb show.

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:05.700
It's even a new one, I think.

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.238
Things to do, huh?

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:12.307
I'm dvring it so you
can watch it later then.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.142
I was thinking
about making popcorn.

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:18.079
Fyi, the dvr
is definitely working,

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:20.048
so you'll have it.

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:42.870
Um, are you busy?

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.505
I mean, I know you're busy,

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.207
but... but can you talk?

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:49.410
Oh, are you going to give me
the silent treatment too?

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.412
No, Alex, I'm not giving you
the silent treatment.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.314
Well, Emily is
and it's not very mature.

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:55.516
So, could you just...
You want me to make your sister

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.418
talk to you
so you'll feel better

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:59.320
because you
let her down terribly?

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.025
Well, when you say it like that
it doesn't sound too great,

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:06.227
but yeah, could you?

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.968
All right.

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:16.671
I... I've done wrong and...

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.973
And I deserve punishment.

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:21.442
It feels good to admit that.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.411
Let her rip, dad.

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.750
Any time now.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.919
Don't hold back.

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:37.258
Fine. I'll start.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.394
Alex, you are grounded
for two weeks!

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.095
No, that's... that's too little.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.497
Four weeks!

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:44.432
Six weeks!

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.601
More?
I'm not grounding you, Alex.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.269
Hard labor it is.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.038
Uh, I'll put up a new fence,

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:52.173
I'll paint the house,
I'll re-sod the lawn.

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:54.442
I'm not going to
punish you at all.

01:11:58.013 --> 01:11:59.881
What?

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:02.450
If I punish you,
when it was over

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:04.152
you'd feel like
you made up for it.

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.454
Instead, I want you
to feel the consequences

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.723
of ruining things
for Emily and her friends.

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:14.329
10 weeks' grounding,
I'll put up a new fence

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:15.863
and I'll paint the house.
No.

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:19.701
Dad! There has got to be some
way I can make this right.

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.502
How can I fix this?

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.071
You can't.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.742
I've got work to do.

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:17.792
Well, thank you...

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.397
Mrs. zamboni.

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:25.700
It's a pretty small town, Alex.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.105
You'd better come in.

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.717
Please excuse me for a second.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:56.631
What... are these your badges?

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.232
And my daughter's
and granddaughter's.

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:05.273
Wait. No way.

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:08.309
Um, i...

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:10.445
I know this photo.

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:13.681
We... well, we have it
in my house.

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:17.218
That's my mom in the middle.

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:20.188
She was in my daughter's troop.

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:21.689
Integrity,

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:23.391
fidelity

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:24.926
and readiness.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.595
Do you know the rest, Alex?

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.867
Responsibility,

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:35.136
a Bumblebee does
what she's supposed to...

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.541
And is accountable
for her actions.

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:43.277
Your mother was
an excellent scout, Alex.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.551
Yeah, well,

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.887
she should have been
Emily's den mom.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:56.958
Anyone would have done
a better job than me.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.766
Well...

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:10.171
I could use
some help around here.

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:13.140
The house needs a coat of paint,
the floors need refinishing.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:17.345
But it depends on who will
actually do the work.

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:19.547
I will.

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:21.148
I... I swear by the code.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.652
Then you've got yourself
a den mother.

01:15:33.712 --> 01:15:35.513
Catch it, catch it, catch it!

01:15:41.186 --> 01:15:42.653
Brrr.

01:15:42.688 --> 01:15:44.222
There is some cold air in here.

01:15:44.256 --> 01:15:45.756
Someone, turn up the heat.

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:51.062
Okay, I get it.

01:15:54.366 --> 01:15:56.000
First off, I just
want to say that...

01:15:58.003 --> 01:15:59.437
I was a real jerk.

01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:00.938
A serious jerk.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:02.473
Biggest jerk of all time.

01:16:02.507 --> 01:16:04.909
Huge jerk.
Jerk.

01:16:04.943 --> 01:16:07.445
All right, guys,
he knows that he was a jerk.

01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:09.814
No, em, it's... it's okay.

01:16:09.848 --> 01:16:11.349
I deserve it.

01:16:14.052 --> 01:16:16.320
Girls, you have to
understand, i...

01:16:16.355 --> 01:16:18.356
I never meant for you
to get in trouble.

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:20.091
I... you have to believe me,

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:23.861
i... um,

01:16:23.895 --> 01:16:26.030
I'm truly sorry.

01:16:26.064 --> 01:16:28.366
I... I wasn't
a good den brother.

01:16:29.601 --> 01:16:31.702
And em...

01:16:36.408 --> 01:16:39.243
I wasn't a good
real brother either.

01:16:39.278 --> 01:16:41.646
It's too bad...

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.383
That "I'm sorry"

01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:47.618
won't get us into camporee.

01:16:47.653 --> 01:16:49.654
No. No, it won't.

01:16:51.423 --> 01:16:52.957
But I found someone who can.

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:57.428
Mrs. j?

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:04.368
Girls...
Whoa.

01:17:04.403 --> 01:17:07.171
This is Mrs. jacklitz.

01:17:07.205 --> 01:17:09.807
She's going to be
your new den mother.

01:17:09.841 --> 01:17:11.375
Whoa.

01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:12.743
Hi, girls.

01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:17.481
Alex, may I have a word
with the girls alone?

01:17:19.084 --> 01:17:20.818
Yeah, sure.

01:17:32.698 --> 01:17:36.200
Girls, who can tell me
the qualities exemplified

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:37.468
by the Bumblebee code?

01:17:37.502 --> 01:17:40.404
Integrity, readiness,

01:17:40.439 --> 01:17:42.239
responsibility...

01:17:42.274 --> 01:17:43.974
And?

01:17:44.009 --> 01:17:46.110
Um, fidelity.

01:17:46.144 --> 01:17:48.512
Do you know what
"fidelity" means?

01:17:48.547 --> 01:17:51.015
Loyalty.
That's right.

01:17:51.049 --> 01:17:54.852
Now, I know Alex wasn't
the perfect den mother.

01:17:54.886 --> 01:17:56.420
He was a liar.

01:17:56.455 --> 01:17:58.322
He lied to us.
He lied to everyone.

01:17:58.357 --> 01:18:01.992
But you knew the truth
about Mrs. zamboni too.

01:18:02.027 --> 01:18:06.330
So, you can't
blame it all on him.

01:18:06.365 --> 01:18:08.699
Let's start with a go-for-it.

01:18:08.734 --> 01:18:10.768
What are we going for?

01:18:10.802 --> 01:18:12.570
How about...

01:18:14.873 --> 01:18:16.340
Forgiveness?

01:18:28.153 --> 01:18:30.321
<i>Good evening, ice hound fans!</i>

01:18:30.355 --> 01:18:32.390
<i>The hounds' hopes are high</i>

01:18:32.424 --> 01:18:34.258
<i>as they prepare to meet
their dreaded rivals</i>

01:18:34.292 --> 01:18:35.860
<i>the norsemen</i>

01:18:35.894 --> 01:18:38.462
<i>following the heartbreaking
last-minute defeat</i>

01:18:38.497 --> 01:18:40.064
<i>when last they met.</i>

01:18:43.268 --> 01:18:44.969
Huh. Enjoy the snow cone?

01:18:45.003 --> 01:18:47.371
Looks like you're not so hot
without a granny wig on.

01:18:47.406 --> 01:18:49.507
Alex! Alex, come on!

01:18:51.209 --> 01:18:52.676
Whatever, Titus.

01:18:52.711 --> 01:18:54.245
Have a good game, man.

01:18:57.215 --> 01:18:59.350
Yeah, whatever to you too, Alex.

01:19:00.419 --> 01:19:01.852
All right. All right, all right.

01:19:01.887 --> 01:19:03.921
So, thanks to Alex,

01:19:03.955 --> 01:19:07.591
we are in the playoffs.
Game plan, as per usual,

01:19:07.626 --> 01:19:11.429
everybody passes the puck
to Alex whenever he thinks he...

01:19:11.463 --> 01:19:13.497
Coach, can I say something?

01:19:13.532 --> 01:19:14.999
Yeah, of course you can.

01:19:15.033 --> 01:19:18.102
Listen up, guys.
Alex is going to speak.

01:19:21.239 --> 01:19:23.707
All you guys deserve an apology.

01:19:23.742 --> 01:19:26.811
I've been a real jerk.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:29.780
Wow. Goose...

01:19:32.050 --> 01:19:33.951
You're the heart and soul
of this team, man.

01:19:35.253 --> 01:19:37.888
I want you
to be captain, not me.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.861
Alex, I don't
want to be captain.

01:19:45.163 --> 01:19:48.265
I want you to be a good captain.

01:19:51.736 --> 01:19:54.038
Okay. Well,

01:19:54.072 --> 01:19:57.141
as captain,
I'd like to implement

01:19:57.175 --> 01:19:59.710
a little play I call
the pressure offense.

01:20:00.812 --> 01:20:03.314
And by "i," I mean goose.

01:20:03.348 --> 01:20:07.585
Well, I say let's
kick some butt!

01:20:07.619 --> 01:20:09.553
Yeah!

01:20:15.694 --> 01:20:17.261
Let's see your moves, Alex.

01:20:17.295 --> 01:20:19.463
I'm sticking to you like glue.

01:20:23.268 --> 01:20:25.269
<i>Pearson wins the face-off</i>

01:20:25.303 --> 01:20:28.572
<i>and... fades back?
Oh, he doesn't have puck!</i>

01:20:28.607 --> 01:20:30.274
<i>A trick play!</i>

01:20:30.308 --> 01:20:32.943
<i>Ice hounds score!</i>

01:20:44.122 --> 01:20:45.723
<i>Hounds lead with just</i>

01:20:45.757 --> 01:20:47.691
<i>10 minutes left
in the first period.</i>

01:20:48.793 --> 01:20:50.694
<i>Pearson has the puck.</i>

01:20:50.729 --> 01:20:53.631
<i>He passes it and... oh!
He gets leveled!</i>

01:20:53.665 --> 01:20:57.001
<i>The norsemen
are all over Pearson.</i>

01:20:57.035 --> 01:20:58.936
<i>All right, he comes in again.</i>

01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:00.738
<i>Oh!</i>

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:03.140
<i>Human decoy Alex Pearson</i>

01:21:03.174 --> 01:21:06.076
<i>leads the norsemen...
He passes it...</i>

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:08.012
<i>Whoa-ho-ho!</i>

01:21:18.156 --> 01:21:20.057
You know, goose,
when you first brought up

01:21:20.091 --> 01:21:21.625
the pressure offense,

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:23.661
you failed to mention
that I get crushed...

01:21:23.695 --> 01:21:26.864
A lot.
Did I? My bad.

01:21:26.898 --> 01:21:29.333
Sorry.
Ah!

01:21:29.367 --> 01:21:31.068
<i>Tied 3 to 3, just seconds left,</i>

01:21:31.102 --> 01:21:33.003
<i>Pearson comes out
from behind the net,</i>

01:21:33.038 --> 01:21:34.538
<i>and this time he doesn't pass.</i>

01:21:34.573 --> 01:21:37.041
<i>He drives up the ice,
moving past the norsemen</i>

01:21:37.075 --> 01:21:38.642
<i>like a knife through butter.</i>

01:21:38.677 --> 01:21:40.511
<i>Alex Pearson is back!</i>

01:21:40.545 --> 01:21:42.346
<i>Pearson closes in
on the norsemen's goal.</i>

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:43.914
<i>He's got a shot there</i>

01:21:43.949 --> 01:21:45.716
<i>- and he passes to Gustavo...
- Three! Two! One!</i>

01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:47.718
<i>Who scores at the buzzer!</i>

01:21:47.752 --> 01:21:50.087
<i>Ice hounds win!</i>

01:21:50.121 --> 01:21:52.423
I'm the best coach ever!

01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:12.776
That was coach reams.
Dude, I'm so sorry.

01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:14.411
What? For making the all-stars?

01:22:14.446 --> 01:22:17.181
It should have been you.
My game plan kept you
in the back.

01:22:17.215 --> 01:22:18.849
No worries. No worries.

01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:20.618
What the heck
was that last pass for?

01:22:20.652 --> 01:22:22.453
You should have taken that shot.

01:22:22.487 --> 01:22:24.622
I knew you had it.
Goose! Goose! Goose!

01:22:24.656 --> 01:22:26.657
Goose! Goose! Goose! Goose!
Get out of here.

01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:28.726
Hey, and don't let
all of this go to your head.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.628
It's not always about you.

01:22:30.662 --> 01:22:33.263
Alex! Alex! He's our man!

01:22:33.298 --> 01:22:35.899
If he can't do it, no one can!

01:22:35.934 --> 01:22:38.702
Two, four, six, eight!

01:22:38.737 --> 01:22:41.872
Who do we appreciate? Alex!

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.974
Go, Alex!

01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:46.977
Dad.

01:22:48.647 --> 01:22:51.482
Um, I thought you were too busy.

01:22:51.516 --> 01:22:53.517
Yeah, well,
the girls needed a ride

01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:55.119
and after they
told me what you'd done,

01:22:55.153 --> 01:22:57.154
how could I refuse?

01:22:57.188 --> 01:22:59.723
You made it to this game?

01:22:59.758 --> 01:23:01.759
You didn't even get
to see me at my best.

01:23:01.793 --> 01:23:04.294
No, I'm pretty sure I did.

01:23:07.966 --> 01:23:11.068
Um, em, girls,

01:23:11.102 --> 01:23:12.736
what are you doing here?

01:23:12.771 --> 01:23:14.271
Wait wait wait,
camporee is tomorrow.

01:23:14.305 --> 01:23:16.507
You should be preparing.
Do you have everything you need?

01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:19.576
Tents? Sleeping bags
and air fresheners?

01:23:19.611 --> 01:23:22.980
Don't worry, we made a list.
We have almost everything.

01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:27.017
We don't have our den mother.

01:23:27.052 --> 01:23:30.354
Uh, but Mrs. jacklitz...

01:23:30.388 --> 01:23:34.091
Alex, Mrs. jacklitz
is a really nice lady,

01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:36.860
but we all talked about it.

01:23:36.895 --> 01:23:40.330
And well, even though
you were kind of selfish

01:23:40.365 --> 01:23:41.965
and sneaky at first,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.368
we never would have
gotten here without you.

01:23:46.237 --> 01:23:47.871
And we want our den mother back.

01:23:52.077 --> 01:23:54.645
Well... well, then what
are we doing here, girls?

01:23:54.679 --> 01:23:56.213
Camporee is tomorrow!

01:23:56.247 --> 01:23:57.781
Yay!

01:24:20.438 --> 01:24:24.408
Follow me to camporee! Whoo!

01:24:26.277 --> 01:24:28.812
Troop 57 reporting for camporee.

01:24:28.847 --> 01:24:32.149
Okay, let me go find
your sign-in sheet.

01:24:32.183 --> 01:24:33.751
Now, girls, remember one thing.

01:24:33.785 --> 01:24:35.986
You have to decide what you
want to do right now, okay?

01:24:37.422 --> 01:24:40.424
How are we doing on that sign...
There seems to be a problem.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:43.527
There's definitely a problem.
What did you just do
with that little girl?

01:24:43.561 --> 01:24:45.829
You can't sign in troop 57

01:24:45.864 --> 01:24:48.098
because there is no troop 57.

01:24:48.133 --> 01:24:50.267
No den mother, no troop.

01:24:50.301 --> 01:24:52.903
Hmm. I'm their den mother.

01:24:57.308 --> 01:25:00.043
"Allowable with written
permission from the parents

01:25:00.078 --> 01:25:02.946
and/or guardians
of the bumblebees in question.

01:25:02.981 --> 01:25:05.549
I believe you'll
find them in order.

01:25:08.253 --> 01:25:12.456
Not so fast. You forgot
one tiny little detail.

01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:15.959
All den mothers
participating in camporee

01:25:15.961 --> 01:25:19.096
must be in full dress uniform.

01:25:26.104 --> 01:25:27.604
Alex!

01:25:37.315 --> 01:25:39.883
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:25:39.918 --> 01:25:42.886
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:25:42.921 --> 01:25:46.323
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:25:46.357 --> 01:25:48.659
Whoo!

01:25:50.295 --> 01:25:52.396
What, you've never seen
a bumble bee troop before?

01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:54.264
Let's go! Come on, girls!

01:26:04.876 --> 01:26:07.911
I never imagined I'd hear
myself say this, son,

01:26:07.946 --> 01:26:09.947
but it fills my heart
with pride to see you

01:26:09.981 --> 01:26:11.982
in that bumble bee girl uniform.

01:26:12.016 --> 01:26:13.684
Whoo!

01:26:15.086 --> 01:26:16.920
Hey, what's all the commotion?

01:26:16.955 --> 01:26:20.090
That boy is making
a mockery of camporee.

01:26:20.124 --> 01:26:21.758
Go do something about it!

01:26:21.793 --> 01:26:24.795
Okay, I think I will.

01:26:24.829 --> 01:26:26.697
I'd like a word with you, son.

01:26:33.004 --> 01:26:35.305
This is quite some stunt
you've pulled here.

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.974
This takes a lot of guts.

01:26:38.543 --> 01:26:40.711
It shows real leadership.

01:26:40.745 --> 01:26:43.313
And that's just
the thing I'm looking for
on the all-star team.

01:26:47.819 --> 01:26:49.853
What?
I got one open spot.
You interested?

01:26:52.924 --> 01:26:56.360
Of course I'm interested, but...

01:26:56.394 --> 01:26:58.428
Well, I'd have to check
the troop schedule

01:26:58.463 --> 01:27:01.999
'cause my bees come first.
Right, girls?

01:27:02.033 --> 01:27:04.234
Yeah!

01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:07.170
Alex!

01:27:11.276 --> 01:27:13.744
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:27:13.845 --> 01:27:16.647
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:27:16.681 --> 01:27:20.050
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:27:20.084 --> 01:27:22.519
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:27:22.553 --> 01:27:26.890
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:27:26.925 --> 01:27:29.927
B-mark. Cut.

01:27:33.064 --> 01:27:34.398
Oh!

01:27:34.432 --> 01:27:37.234
We're doing a home...

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.707
Sorry.

01:27:46.210 --> 01:27:48.178
Boo-ya!

01:27:48.212 --> 01:27:50.514
Oh...
let's...
go...

01:27:50.548 --> 01:27:53.016
- You know.
- Bumblebees!

01:27:54.385 --> 01:27:56.286
That one was... that's
the wrong one, isn't I?

01:27:59.724 --> 01:28:01.224
I fell over.
I'm sorry.

01:28:01.259 --> 01:28:03.727
Go, Alex!

01:28:03.761 --> 01:28:06.964
You're going to need
a steak when you get home.
