16:11.917 --> 16:16.667
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE BIG TIME.

16:16.667 --> 16:20.166
- YEAH, RIGHT.

16:21.583 --> 16:26.291
- NOW THAT I'VE DONE MY JOB,
I CAN GET ON WITH MY WORK.

16:26.291 --> 16:28.458
THAT LOOKS PROMISING.

16:28.458 --> 16:31.208
THERE'S SOME MORE JARS
OVER THERE.

16:31.208 --> 16:34.083
I'LL GET IT.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.625
TRAVIS MARSHALL.

16:51.792 --> 16:54.667
DR. BENJAMIN CARLSON,
FROM MIAMI.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.500
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

16:56.500 --> 16:58.125
- JUST SOME PAINT THINNER.

16:58.125 --> 17:01.166
- WHAT THE FUCK IS
CHLORPROMAZINE?

17:01.166 --> 17:03.500
HEY, ANDERSON.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.083
- OKAY, I'LL GET BACK AT YOU.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.959
- GET A LINE ON
DR. BENJAMIN CARLSON.

17:07.959 --> 17:10.000
THINK TRAVIS WAS A PATIENT
OF HIS.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.125
- GOT IT.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.917
- AT LEAST I STILL HAVE
GELLAR'S BLOG.

17:16.917 --> 17:20.000
THE PRODIGAL SON
HAS RETURNED.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.834
"FALSE PROPHET."
HE'S TALKING TO ME.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.000
I LISTENED TO YOU ONCE
AND I MADE A MISTAKE,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.542
BUT NEVER AGAIN.

17:26.542 --> 17:28.875
I'M GOING TO FIX IT.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.208
WHAT'S HIS MISTAKE?

17:31.208 --> 17:35.250
WAS IT STRAYING FROM GELLAR
AND LISTENING TO ME?

17:35.250 --> 17:38.208
[both giggling]

17:40.041 --> 17:41.792
- I'M PSYCHED
YOU COULD DO BREAKFAST.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.834
- ONE OF THE PERKS
OF BEING A NANNY.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.875
TWO HOURS OFF WHILE HARRISON'S
IN PRESCHOOL.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.709
- I NEED A LITTLE ADVICE.

17:48.709 --> 17:50.875
I REALLY WANT TO SHOW DEXTER
MY VIDEO GAME, YOU KNOW,

17:50.875 --> 17:53.208
FIND OUT WHAT A REAL BLOOD
SPATTER ANALYST THINKS OF IT.

17:53.208 --> 17:54.959
- GOOD IDEA.

17:54.959 --> 17:57.542
- I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE GUY
MAKE A MISTAKE, LIKE, EVER.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.041
- SO YOU WANT TO IMPRESS HIM.
- YEAH.

18:00.041 --> 18:02.625
I MEAN, HE'S--
HE'S KIND OF INTENSE.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.834
- BABE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S LIKE AT WORK,

18:04.834 --> 18:08.291
BUT ONCE YOU SEEN HIM READING
EVERYBODY POOPS  TO HARRISON,

18:08.291 --> 18:12.166
YOU REALIZE
HE'S A BIG SOFTIE.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.542
JUST TALK TO HIM.

18:17.458 --> 18:18.750
- LIEUTENANT?

18:18.750 --> 18:21.417
I HAVE THE PERSONAL EFFECTS
OF JESSICA MORRIS.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.500
YOU ASKED FOR THEM.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.542
- OH, RIGHT, FUCK.
THE DEAD CALL GIRL.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.959
UM...
[elevator dings]

18:26.959 --> 18:29.375
JUST PUT 'EM IN MY OFFICE.
I'LL LOOK AT IT LATER.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.959
- OKAY.

18:31.959 --> 18:34.291
STILL LOOKING
INTO THAT CASE.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.083
- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.
I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.

18:36.083 --> 18:40.417
- YOU'RE NOT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

18:40.417 --> 18:43.917
- I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TRAVIS NEEDS TO FIX.

18:43.917 --> 18:46.667
WHAT EXACTLY IS WORMWOOD...

18:46.667 --> 18:49.875
AND WHO WILL HIS VICTIM BE?

18:49.875 --> 18:52.125
- OKAY, PEOPLE, BIG DAY,
SO LET'S GET STARTED.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.333
- ARE YOU RUNNING
THE BRIEFING?

18:54.333 --> 18:56.333
- DOOMSDAY IS OUR MOST
IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION,

18:56.333 --> 18:59.417
AND THE MORE I HELP OUT
THE MORE TIME YOU'LL HAVE

18:59.417 --> 19:01.792
TO FOCUS ON OTHER CASES.

19:01.792 --> 19:05.875
- YOU'RE THE BOSS.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.625
- YOU OKAY?
- PEACHY FUCKING KEEN.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.208
- SO I UNDERSTAND THAT

19:09.208 --> 19:11.667
WE FOUND DOOMSDAY'S HIDEOUT.
WHERE WAS IT?

19:11.667 --> 19:14.291
- IN AN ABANDONED CHURCH.
- GREAT.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.250
BRING ME UP TO SPEED.

19:16.250 --> 19:18.208
- I, UH,
FOUND A HIDDEN CELLAR.

19:18.208 --> 19:20.291
I WAS SURE IT WAS GONNA BE
FILLED WITH BODY PARTS

19:20.291 --> 19:23.667
BUT THERE WAS JUST SOME CHURCH
CRAP AND AN OLD FREEZER.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.125
- SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.750
- DEXTER?
MASUKA?

19:27.750 --> 19:31.834
- PLACE WAS COVERED IN PRINTS
FROM TRAVIS AND GELLAR.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.208
- WHAT ABOUT THE BLOOD
IN THE JARS?

19:33.208 --> 19:34.250
- WHAT JARS?

19:34.250 --> 19:35.750
- WE FOUND BLOODY JARS
IN THE TRASH. DEX?

19:35.750 --> 19:38.000
- SAME TYPE AS TRAVIS',

19:38.000 --> 19:39.834
AND IT MATCHED SOME
OF THE SAMPLES WE TOOK

19:39.834 --> 19:41.125
FROM THE BOWLS OF WRATH.

19:41.125 --> 19:44.542
- I WAS THINKING HOLLY BENSON,
THE GIRL WHO ESCAPED.

19:44.542 --> 19:46.875
SHE THOUGHT THEY
MADE HER DRINK BLOOD.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.417
MAYBE IT WAS FROM THOSE JARS.

19:48.417 --> 19:52.834
- HOLLY BENSON DIDN'T ESCAPE.
TRAVIS LET HER GO BECAUSE OF ME.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.792
- ANDERSON, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
ANYTHING ELSE?

19:55.792 --> 20:00.917
- COULD SHE BE THE MISTAKE
TRAVIS WAS TALKING ABOUT?

20:00.917 --> 20:03.667
THE MISTAKE HE NEEDS TO FIX.

20:04.959 --> 20:09.291
TRAVIS IS ALREADY BACK
ON GELLAR'S PATH.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.875
WILL HOLLY BE HIS VICTIM
IN THE WORMWOOD TABLEAU?

20:12.875 --> 20:16.834
IF I FIND HOLLY,
HOPEFULLY I'LL FIND TRAVIS.

20:20.875 --> 20:22.917
- DEXTER. HEY!

20:22.917 --> 20:24.333
JAMIE AND I WENT
TO YOUR DONUT SHOP THIS MORNING.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.709
- NOT NOW, LOUIS.

20:38.208 --> 20:41.000
[knocking]

20:41.000 --> 20:43.166
[door unlocking]

20:45.458 --> 20:46.625
- IT'S--IT'S YOU.

20:46.625 --> 20:49.041
- AND YOU'RE DOOMSDAY ADAM.

20:49.041 --> 20:52.250
- IT'S JUST I--
I NEVER...IMAGINED--

20:52.250 --> 20:53.917
STEVE DORSEY.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.500
THIS IS SUCH AN HONOR.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.500
- IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU TOO,
STEVE.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.417
DO YOU MIND IF I COME IN?
I'M KIND OF BEING HUNTED.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.667
- OH, RIGHT!
YEP, PLEASE.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.542
COME ON IN.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.917
BETH, GET IN HERE
AND MEET OUR GUEST.

21:09.917 --> 21:13.083
- WELL, I HOPE HE'S HUNGRY.

21:13.083 --> 21:15.709
I HAVE SNACKS.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.667
[breathlessly]
OH, MY--

21:17.667 --> 21:19.583
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

21:19.583 --> 21:21.250
- TRAVIS MARSHALL.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.709
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, BETH.

21:22.709 --> 21:27.000
- OH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
I'VE SEEN YOU ON THE NEWS.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.125
IS PROFESSOR GELLAR
COMING TOO?

21:29.125 --> 21:31.667
- NO. NOT TODAY.

21:31.667 --> 21:34.959
- WE WERE JUST SO CONFUSED
BY HIS BLOG.

21:34.959 --> 21:37.000
HE SAID THIS WAS ALL
THE DEVIL'S ERRAND.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
- PROFESSOR GELLAR
DIDN'T WRITE THAT.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.458
IT WAS A FALSE PROPHET

21:40.458 --> 21:42.000
TRYING TO THROW A MONKEY WRENCH
INTO GOD'S PLAN.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.166
- I KNEW IT.

21:44.166 --> 21:48.375
- WELL, PLEASE SIT DOWN.

21:48.375 --> 21:52.166
SORRY I JUST HAVE, UM,
VELVEETA AND CRACKERS.

21:52.166 --> 21:57.583
STEVE'S BEEN OUT OF WORK
LATELY AND...

21:57.583 --> 21:58.959
- I KNOW HOW IT IS.

21:58.959 --> 22:03.792
SOMETIMES IT FEELS AS IF
GOD HAS FORGOTTEN US.

22:03.792 --> 22:08.500
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT YOUR TIME HAS COME.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.291
THE FAITHFUL WILL BE GIVEN

22:10.291 --> 22:13.834
UNTOLD RICHES
IN GOD'S NEW KINGDOM...

22:13.834 --> 22:18.166
IF YOU TRUST AND OBEY.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.375
- WE'RE READY,
MR. MARSHALL.

22:20.375 --> 22:22.792
WE'LL DO WHATEVER YOU SAY.

22:22.792 --> 22:26.000
- GOOD.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.458
BUT FIRST, I NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE FULLY COMMITTED.

22:31.583 --> 22:35.709
- HOLLY BENSON'S APARTMENT--
THE VICTIM WHO WOULD'VE BEEN.

22:35.709 --> 22:38.166
I CAN STAKE THE PLACE OUT.

22:38.166 --> 22:41.333
WAIT AND SEE
IF TRAVIS SHOWS UP.

22:44.542 --> 22:47.917
- AREN'T YOU PUTTING A LOT
OF EGGS IN THE HOLLY BASKET?

22:47.917 --> 22:50.792
- I'M TRUSTING MY INSTINCTS.

22:50.792 --> 22:55.166
SOMETHING I SHOULD'VE DONE
A LONG TIME AGO.

22:59.208 --> 23:02.834
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE'S HERE.

23:02.834 --> 23:05.291
WHAT IF TRAVIS
GOT TO HER FIRST?

23:05.291 --> 23:10.542
- THERE'S NO SIGNS
OF A STRUGGLE OR A BREAK-IN.

23:10.542 --> 23:15.083
- NOT AN OUNCE OF MAKEUP.
NO HAIRBRUSH, NO TOOTHBRUSH.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.500
- SHE COULD'VE PACKED A BAG,
GONE OUT OF TOWN.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.041
- SHE STILL WON'T BE SAFE.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.208
TRAVIS IS DETERMINED TO FIND HER
WHEREVER SHE IS.

23:21.208 --> 23:26.375
- WHICH IS WHY I HAVE TO
MAKE SURE I FIND HER FIRST.

23:26.375 --> 23:30.875
COME ON, HOLLY.
GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN USE.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.583
SOMETHING ELSE.

23:32.583 --> 23:35.959
- WHO WOULD SHE BE WITH?
FAMILY? FRIENDS?

23:35.959 --> 23:39.542
- BOYFRIEND.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.875
I BET HE KNOWS WHERE SHE IS.

23:41.875 --> 23:46.583
PETER GRANT.
I'M GUESSING THIS IS HIM.

23:54.542 --> 23:58.375
[distant music and voices]

24:10.083 --> 24:12.667
HI, I'M LOOKING FOR, UH,
PETER GRANT.

24:12.667 --> 24:14.667
- OH, MY DAD.

24:14.667 --> 24:16.125
- IS HE AT HOME?

24:16.125 --> 24:19.750
- DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE
PARENTAL SUPERVISION?

24:19.750 --> 24:23.125
HE'S OFF IN SPAIN...
OR PORTUGAL MAYBE.

24:23.125 --> 24:26.125
- CAN YOU TELL ME IF HE KNOWS
A WOMAN NAMED HOLLY BENSON?

24:26.125 --> 24:29.333
- SHE'S MY DAD'S "SEX-RETARY."
WHY?

24:29.333 --> 24:32.500
- I, UH--I'M A FRIEND.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.166
CAN'T SEEM TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH HER.

24:34.166 --> 24:36.166
- YEAH, WELL, NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOUR FRIEND

24:36.166 --> 24:38.792
IS A TOTAL SLAM-PIG.

24:38.792 --> 24:42.709
- RIGHT. SLAM-PIG.
ANY IDEA WHERE I CAN FIND HER?

24:42.709 --> 24:44.417
- I DON'T KNOW.
THE YACHT MAYBE?

24:44.417 --> 24:45.667
- YACHT?

24:45.667 --> 24:47.417
- MY DAD HAS THIS BOAT
THAT HE REFUSES TO GET RID OF.

24:47.417 --> 24:50.542
PROBABLY
SOME KIND OF FUCK PAD.

24:50.542 --> 24:52.208
- WHERE IS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

24:52.208 --> 24:54.125
ON THE WATER SOMEWHERE.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.291
- THANKS.

24:55.291 --> 24:56.667
- IF YOU DO FIND HER, THOUGH,

24:56.667 --> 24:58.583
WILL YOU GIVE HER
A MESSAGE FOR ME?

25:05.208 --> 25:07.542
- NICE KID.

25:07.542 --> 25:09.583
BUT IF SHE'S RIGHT AND HOLLY'S
OUT ON A BOAT ALONE,

25:09.583 --> 25:12.625
SHE'S A SITTING DUCK
FOR TRAVIS.

25:12.625 --> 25:15.375
TIME TO PLAY
"FIND THE FUCK PAD."

25:15.375 --> 25:16.792
- HE'S IN SPAIN
WITH HIS WIFE.

25:16.792 --> 25:19.458
IF HE WAS LYING, WOULD HE
LET ME CRASH ON HIS BOAT

25:19.458 --> 25:21.500
WHILE HE'S AWAY?

25:23.000 --> 25:26.834
WHO ASKED YOU ANYWAY?
I GOT TO GO.

25:57.333 --> 26:01.000
[light thumping]

26:03.834 --> 26:08.709
HELLO?

26:12.959 --> 26:15.083
WHO'S THERE?

26:15.083 --> 26:17.041
- HELLO, WHORE.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.667
- [gasps]

26:24.208 --> 26:29.250
[screaming]

26:29.250 --> 26:31.792
- SHH.

26:31.792 --> 26:33.959
WE'RE GOING FOR
A LITTLE CRUISE.

26:50.208 --> 26:53.875
[light snoring]

26:56.625 --> 26:59.250
- WHAT THE FUCK?

26:59.250 --> 27:02.542
YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE.
- I'M AN ASSHOLE?

27:02.542 --> 27:04.542
DOOMSDAY'S OUT THERE SEARCHING
FOR HIS NEXT VICTIM

27:04.542 --> 27:07.125
AND YOU'RE ASLEEP ON THE JOB.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.333
- WHAT ARE YOU,
FUCKING SUPERCOP?

27:08.333 --> 27:10.583
- NO.
I GIVE A SHIT.

27:10.583 --> 27:12.458
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TRY IT FOR ONCE,

27:12.458 --> 27:14.458
INSTEAD OF GOING OUT DRINKING
EVERY NIGHT

27:14.458 --> 27:16.250
AND COMING TO WORK
WHILE MESSED UP.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.625
- GIVE IT A FUCKING REST, MAN.
- SO WHAT...

27:18.625 --> 27:19.834
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
BROKE UP WITH YOU.

27:19.834 --> 27:21.333
GET OVER IT.
- FUCK THAT.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.125
I'M JUST BEING
A SINGLE GUY HAVING FUN.

27:23.125 --> 27:25.458
YOU SHOULD TRY IT FOR ONCE.
- HEY.

27:25.458 --> 27:27.625
ANY LEADS
ON A WORMWOOD VICTIM?

27:27.625 --> 27:29.291
- WE'RE GOING OVER TO GELLAR'S
AND TRAVIS'

27:29.291 --> 27:31.458
FRIENDS, RELATIVES,
AND ACQUAINTANCES.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.542
FIGURE THE LAST TWO VICTIMS
WERE PERSONAL.

27:33.542 --> 27:34.959
- GOOD THINKING.
KEEP AT IT.

27:34.959 --> 27:36.834
ANY LUCK
ON THE DR. CARLSON FRONT?

27:36.834 --> 27:38.667
- TURNS OUT HE PASSED AWAY
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

27:38.667 --> 27:40.125
BUT I GOT A COURT ORDER

27:40.125 --> 27:42.208
RELEASING TRAVIS MARSHALL'S
PSYCH EVAL.

27:42.208 --> 27:44.291
DRUGS WERE ANTIPSYCHOTICS.

27:44.291 --> 27:46.667
APPARENTLY HE HAD SOME
BREAKS WITH REALITY.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.000
- JESUS. VIOLENT TENDENCIES
SINCE CHILDHOOD,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.417
A LACK OF EMPATHY,

27:50.417 --> 27:52.750
MASTER MANIPULATOR,
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.000
- IT MAKES SENSE.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.333
FUCKER WANTS TO END THE WORLD.

27:55.333 --> 27:56.667
- WHAT'S THAT?

27:56.667 --> 27:57.709
- TRAVIS' PSYCH FILE.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.792
- MORE LIKE PSYCH-O FILE.

27:59.792 --> 28:01.875
THE GUY WAS COMPLETE
SOCIOPATH.

28:01.875 --> 28:04.500
- SHIT, IT SAYS HERE THE SHRINK
THOUGHT HE KILLED HIS PARENTS.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.000
- I THOUGHT
IT WAS A CAR ACCIDENT.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
- OR NOT.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.542
APPARENTLY TRAVIS
ATTACKED HIS FATHER

28:08.542 --> 28:10.417
AND GRABBED THE WHEEL.

28:10.417 --> 28:13.542
TURNED IT RIGHT INTO A TREE.

28:13.542 --> 28:15.500
- ANY SIGNS
OF PARENTAL ABUSE?

28:15.500 --> 28:18.000
- MM-MM.
IT'S SO WEIRD.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.834
HIS SISTER SEEMED SO CONVINCED
HE WAS A GOOD GUY.

28:19.834 --> 28:22.792
- MAYBE SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

28:22.792 --> 28:25.667
- ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

28:25.667 --> 28:31.583
- HE'S BEEN A MONSTER
FROM THE START.

28:31.583 --> 28:34.917
HE'S USING GELLAR
TO JUSTIFY HIS KILLS.

28:34.917 --> 28:37.041
- A LOT OF PEOPLE JUSTIFY
THEIR KILLS.

28:37.041 --> 28:41.583
- YOU MEAN ME?
YOU JUSTIFIED MY KILLS.

28:41.583 --> 28:43.417
YOU TAUGHT ME THE CODE.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.083
- I KEPT YOU FROM
BECOMING YOUR BROTHER.

28:45.083 --> 28:48.208
- MAKING ME A KILLER
WAS THE BEST YOU COULD DO.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.000
- YOU WERE ALREADY
GONNA BE A KILLER.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.375
- I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

28:54.375 --> 28:57.041
THERE IT IS.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.291
THE FUCK PAD.

28:58.291 --> 29:00.834
THE RICOCHET RABBIT.

29:05.709 --> 29:07.125
- WHERE YOU GOING?

29:07.125 --> 29:10.500
- I KNOW THIS MARINA.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.333
- I HAD A FREAK-OUT
AT A CRIME SCENE TODAY.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.291
- IS THAT UNUSUAL?

29:17.291 --> 29:21.041
- YES, THAT'S UNUSUAL.

29:21.041 --> 29:22.583
SEEN A LOT OF FUCKED UP SHIT

29:22.583 --> 29:24.709
AND IT USUALLY JUST ROLLS
RIGHT OFF.

29:24.709 --> 29:27.083
- BUT NOT TODAY.

29:27.083 --> 29:28.458
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN WEIRDER

29:28.458 --> 29:29.875
IS THE STUFF THAT
USUALLY FUCKS ME UP

29:29.875 --> 29:31.792
DIDN'T EVEN PHASE ME TODAY.
- LIKE WHAT?

29:31.792 --> 29:33.917
- LIKE LAGUERTA TRYING TO SWING
HER DICK AROUND

29:33.917 --> 29:35.083
IN THE BRIEFING ROOM.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.458
I HANDLED THAT LIKE A CHAMP.

29:36.458 --> 29:39.709
- WELL, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

29:39.709 --> 29:44.291
- SO WHY DID I LOSE MY SHIT
WHEN I WALKED INTO THAT CHURCH?

29:44.291 --> 29:46.458
- DID THE CHURCH HAVE SOME KIND
OF SIGNIFICANCE FOR YOU?

29:46.458 --> 29:48.041
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.417
THE ONLY TIME I GO TO CHURCH
IS TO GO TO A FUNERAL, YOU KNOW?

29:50.417 --> 29:53.583
MY MOM, MY DAD...

29:53.583 --> 29:56.834
BOYFRIENDS,
MY SISTER-IN-LAW.

29:56.834 --> 30:01.166
- SO YOU ASSOCIATE CHURCH
WITH LOSS.

30:01.166 --> 30:04.667
- I GUESS.

30:04.667 --> 30:06.417
WHATEVER.
DOESN'T MATTER.

30:06.417 --> 30:08.333
MY BROTHER SHOWED UP,
HE CALMED ME DOWN.

30:08.333 --> 30:10.750
- DEXTER?

30:10.750 --> 30:12.208
WAS IT SOMETHING
THAT HE SAID?

30:12.208 --> 30:14.959
- UM...

30:14.959 --> 30:17.333
I GUESS.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.792
NOT REALLY.

30:19.792 --> 30:24.792
IT WAS MORE JUST HIM
BEING THERE.

30:24.792 --> 30:27.625
COME TO THINK OF IT...

30:27.625 --> 30:32.875
EVERY TIME THE SHIT HITS
THE FAN, I GO TO HIM.

30:32.875 --> 30:34.333
I'VE EVEN MOVED IN WITH HIM
A FEW TIMES.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.166
- HE'S YOUR SAFE PLACE.
- YEAH.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.333
SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

30:39.333 --> 30:44.208
I USED TO HAVE THESE NIGHTMARES,
AND...

30:44.208 --> 30:50.041
I WOULD SNEAK INTO HIS ROOM
AND I'D CURL UP ON THE FLOOR.

30:50.041 --> 30:52.291
HE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS THERE.

30:56.375 --> 30:58.375
IS THAT WEIRD?

30:58.375 --> 31:00.333
- I DON'T KNOW.

31:00.333 --> 31:02.500
DO YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD?

31:05.166 --> 31:09.709
- NOT REALLY.
HE'S MY BROTHER.

31:09.709 --> 31:12.125
I THINK IT'S SWEET.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.083
- [whimpering]

31:19.083 --> 31:22.291
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

31:22.291 --> 31:24.667
- YOU MEAN,
WHAT ARE WE  GOING TO DO.

31:24.667 --> 31:26.500
WE'RE GOING TO KILL HER,
BETH.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.458
- OH!
- [grunting]

31:28.458 --> 31:29.875
- HE'S TESTING OUR FAITH.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.542
- LIKE ABRAHAM.

31:31.542 --> 31:33.333
YOU'VE GOT IT EASY.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.709
HE WAS ASKED TO SACRIFICE
HIS SON.

31:35.709 --> 31:37.709
YOU JUST HAVE TO PITCH IN
AND HELP KILL A WHORE.

31:37.709 --> 31:40.083
- [screaming]
- I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT.

31:44.083 --> 31:47.041
- I UNDERSTAND, BETH.

31:47.041 --> 31:50.041
BUT YOU'LL BE
PURIFYING HER SINS.

31:50.041 --> 31:53.208
HER SOUL WILL KNOW PARADISE
BECAUSE OF YOUR STRENGTH,

31:53.208 --> 31:56.291
YOUR LOVE.

31:56.291 --> 31:58.667
COME ON.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.500
LET'S SHOW HER SOME LOVE.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.166
- [whimpering]

32:03.166 --> 32:05.959
[muffled grunts and screams]

32:26.375 --> 32:30.625
[Harrison giggling]

32:32.417 --> 32:34.208
- OH. HEY, DEXTER!

32:34.208 --> 32:37.792
LOUIS GOT HERE A LITTLE EARLY
TO PICK ME UP FOR OUR DATE.

32:37.792 --> 32:40.500
- YOU HAVE A DATE?
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD STAY.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.458
- SORRY.

32:42.458 --> 32:45.792
- I DON'T SUPPOSED YOU'D WANNA
HAVE YOUR DATE HERE.

32:45.792 --> 32:47.291
- WE CAN'T.

32:47.291 --> 32:51.166
LOUIS BOUGHT US TICKETS
TO GO SEE THE AVETT BROTHERS.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.333
- CAN'T GO ANOTHER TIME?

32:52.333 --> 32:53.875
- THEY'RE ONLY PLAYING
TONIGHT.

32:53.875 --> 32:55.667
[Harrison babbles]

32:58.500 --> 33:00.375
- HEY, DEXTER.

33:00.375 --> 33:03.291
UH...I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE

33:03.291 --> 33:05.250
YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT MY GAME
BEFORE WE GO.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.709
I MEAN,
IF IT'S NOT A BAD TIME.

33:06.709 --> 33:08.834
- I SHOULD PROBABLY
PUT HARRISON DOWN.

33:08.834 --> 33:11.000
- OH, I GOT HIM.
YOU TAKE IT EASY.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.792
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD
A LONG DAY AT WORK.

33:17.250 --> 33:18.625
- DADDY.

33:18.625 --> 33:22.000
[giggling]

33:22.000 --> 33:25.458
- SO...
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE A MINUTE.

33:25.458 --> 33:29.500
- LOOKS LIKE I DO.
- AWESOME.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.709
I'LL JUST--I'LL BRING THE GAME
UP ON MY LAPTOP.

33:31.709 --> 33:36.583
UH, SO...THE GAME...

33:36.583 --> 33:38.250
IS ABOUT HOMICIDE.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.583
AND I KNOW THERE'S, LIKE,

33:39.583 --> 33:41.125
A MILLION VIDEO GAMES OUT THERE
ABOUT THAT.

33:41.125 --> 33:43.208
BUT THE SECRET
TO THIS GAME IS--

33:43.208 --> 33:44.834
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD JAMIE
THIS YET--

33:44.834 --> 33:47.959
BUT IN MY GAME...
YOU CAN BE...

33:47.959 --> 33:50.667
THE SERIAL KILLER.

33:52.458 --> 33:54.750
- WHAT?

33:54.750 --> 33:56.834
- SEE, YOU HAVE
THESE CHARACTER CHOICES.

33:56.834 --> 34:02.000
YOU CAN BE, UH, DAHMER,
JACK THE RIPPER,

34:02.000 --> 34:03.875
THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.417
- I AM  THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.

34:06.417 --> 34:08.709
- SO...

34:08.709 --> 34:12.333
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

34:12.333 --> 34:14.250
- I THINK THIS IS OFFENSIVE.

34:16.792 --> 34:21.875
WHO WOULD CHOOSE
TO BE A SERIAL KILLER?

34:21.875 --> 34:26.667
- WELL, I MEAN,
IT'S LIKE A VICARIOUS THRILL.

34:26.667 --> 34:31.083
- VICARIOUS THRILL?

34:31.083 --> 34:33.792
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TAKE A LIFE?

34:33.792 --> 34:36.166
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT TO?

34:37.875 --> 34:42.250
IT'S A BAD IDEA.
DO SOMETHING ELSE.

34:48.750 --> 34:52.208
- SO?

34:52.208 --> 34:55.875
- I'M NOT--
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

34:55.875 --> 34:58.750
I THINK I SHOULD GO HOME.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.417
- AND MISS THE SHOW?

35:00.417 --> 35:03.417
- I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT, UH--

35:03.417 --> 35:06.291
I'M NOT UP TO IT.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.875

35:17.417 --> 35:20.583
- THIS IS THE SPOT,
BUT NO BOAT.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.959
WHICH MEANS HOLLY
IS PROBABLY ON IT.

35:22.959 --> 35:26.917
UNFORTUNATELY,
TRAVIS MAY BE WITH HER.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.166
ONLY ONE WAY TO KNOW
FOR SURE.

35:30.166 --> 35:34.250
CHECK THE SECURITY CAMERA
FOOTAGE.

35:37.291 --> 35:41.333

HOW CAN I HELP YOU TONIGHT?

36:56.583 --> 36:59.083

36:59.083 --> 37:00.792
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I GOT
INTO A FIGHT

37:00.792 --> 37:03.250
AND SHE TOOK OFF WITH MY BOAT
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WENT.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.875
- I HAVE THE COORDINATES

37:04.875 --> 37:06.709
I'LL NOTIFY THE POLICE.

37:06.709 --> 37:08.875

37:08.875 --> 37:10.542
- SORRY, SIR, IT'S PROTOCOL.

37:10.542 --> 37:12.041
- I KNOW...

37:12.041 --> 37:14.041
IT'S JUST...I DON'T THINK
MY WIFE WOULD BE TOO THRILLED

37:14.041 --> 37:17.917
TO FIND OUT
ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND.

37:17.917 --> 37:19.709
- I UNDERSTAND.

37:19.709 --> 37:21.875
SHE'S GOT A BIT
OF A JUMP ON YOU.

37:21.875 --> 37:25.417
I'VE GOT HER LOCATION
RIGHT HERE.

38:03.834 --> 38:08.083
- THIS...IS WORMWOOD.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.750
- I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE BIGGER.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.750
- SO WE'RE READY?
- NOT YET.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.542
WE HAVE TO COVER OUR TRACKS.
POLICE WILL FIND THIS PLACE.

38:16.542 --> 38:18.458
- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

38:18.458 --> 38:20.375
THE WORLD'S ENDING IN FOUR DAYS.
IT DOESN'T--

38:20.375 --> 38:24.208
- IT WILL ONLY END
IF WE COMPLETE OUR WORK.

38:24.208 --> 38:26.542
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN
IF WE'RE IN JAIL.

38:26.542 --> 38:30.083

41:41.250 --> 41:44.625
- IT'S WORTH CHECKING OUT.

41:44.625 --> 41:46.083
YOU THINK YOU COULD
TRACK DOWN

41:46.083 --> 41:48.625
DOOMSDAY ADAM'S REAL NAME
AND ADDRESS?

41:48.625 --> 41:51.625
- HIS NAME IS STEVE DORSEY.

41:51.625 --> 41:54.667
HERE'S HIS ADDRESS.

41:54.667 --> 41:56.834
- GOOD WORK.

41:56.834 --> 42:00.291
I'LL CALL QUINN,
GO CHECK IT OUT.

42:02.750 --> 42:04.917
- AT LEAST SOMEONE AROUND HERE
APPRECIATES ME.

42:04.917 --> 42:08.834
[line trilling]

42:08.834 --> 42:10.834
- [voicemail] HEY, IT'S QUINN.
[beep]

42:10.834 --> 42:15.625
- FOR THE FOURTH FUCKIN' TIME,
ANSWER YOUR PHONE.

42:15.625 --> 42:18.542
I'M NOT CALLING AGAIN,
JUST GET HERE.

42:37.917 --> 42:41.041
SERGEANT BATISTA,
MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

42:41.041 --> 42:45.041
ARE YOU MRS. BETH DORSEY?
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

42:45.041 --> 42:46.834
- IS YOUR HUSBAND HOME?

42:46.834 --> 42:49.083
- NO, HE'S NOT.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

42:49.083 --> 42:50.667
- I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS

42:50.667 --> 42:52.625
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

42:52.625 --> 42:56.250
ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOUR HUSBAND
HAS BEEN POSTING ON A BLOG

42:56.250 --> 42:57.875
BY A PROFESSOR GELLAR?

42:57.875 --> 43:01.875
- MM, GOSH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TALK TO HIM WHEN HE GETS BACK.

43:01.875 --> 43:05.166
- HOW ABOUT WE START WITH YOU
AND WE TAKE IT FROM THERE?

43:24.291 --> 43:27.917
- FOUND THE FUCK PAD.

43:27.917 --> 43:31.333
TRAVIS.

43:31.333 --> 43:35.041
WHY IS HE IN A HAZMAT SUIT?

43:58.625 --> 44:00.625
[muffled wheezing]

44:12.542 --> 44:15.417
- YOU'RE TOO LATE.

44:15.417 --> 44:17.458
WORMWOOD CAN'T BE STOPPED.

44:17.458 --> 44:19.750
- NO!

44:22.625 --> 44:26.417
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO SET THINGS RIGHT.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.834
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT THIS WAS ALL A JOKE?

44:31.834 --> 44:34.291
THE VIDEOS YOUR HUSBAND POSTED
AS DOOMSDAY ADAM,

44:34.291 --> 44:36.500
THE WHOLE...CHOSEN THING?

44:36.500 --> 44:39.250
- MY HUSBAND HAS KIND OF
A STRANGE SENSE OF HUMOR.

44:39.250 --> 44:40.667
- YEAH, I WOULD SAY SO.

44:40.667 --> 44:42.542
- STEVE'S BEEN OUT OF WORK
LATELY.

44:42.542 --> 44:45.583
HE WAS HOPING THE VIDEOS
MIGHT GO VIRAL

44:45.583 --> 44:46.709
AND GET HIM SOME ATTENTION,

44:46.709 --> 44:48.083
AND I JUST WANTED TO BE
SUPPORTIVE.

44:48.083 --> 44:49.667
- MRS. DORSEY,

44:49.667 --> 44:52.709
THESE MURDERS ARE NOTHING
TO BE JOKING AROUND ABOUT.

44:52.709 --> 44:55.750
YOUR HUSBAND WASTED VALUABLE
POLICE TIME

44:55.750 --> 44:57.333
AND RESOURCES THAT COULD'VE
BEEN SPENT

44:57.333 --> 44:59.333
CATCHING THE DOOMSDAY KILLERS.

44:59.333 --> 45:01.125
- I AM SO SORRY.

45:01.125 --> 45:04.500
I WILL TALK TO STEVE--TELL HIM
TO GET THOSE VIDEOS DOWN.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.125
THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

45:07.125 --> 45:09.959
- I'D APPRECIATE THAT.

45:22.875 --> 45:25.208
IF THIS WAS ALL A JOKE,

45:25.208 --> 45:28.458
WHY DO YOU HAVE ALL THESE BOOKS
BY PROFESSOR JAMES GELLAR?

45:28.458 --> 45:31.875
[grunts]

45:33.250 --> 45:35.667
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
HE'S A COP.

45:35.667 --> 45:38.458
- HE DOESN'T ENFORCE
GOD'S LAW.

45:38.458 --> 45:41.125
WE DO.

45:41.125 --> 45:44.208
IT'S A SIGN.

45:47.125 --> 45:48.834
MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

45:48.834 --> 45:51.166
THAT'S WHERE GOD WANTS US
TO STAGE WORMWOOD.

45:55.083 --> 45:57.333
- NOTHING TO TELL YOU
WHAT WORMWOOD IS GOING TO BE.

45:57.333 --> 45:59.083
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE,

45:59.083 --> 46:02.125
I WANNA KNOW WHERE
IT'S GONNA BE.

46:02.125 --> 46:04.417
I HAVE TO FIX THIS.

46:04.417 --> 46:06.542
[muffled thumping]

46:23.583 --> 46:26.792
[motor whirring]

46:39.875 --> 46:41.417
HOLLY.

46:41.417 --> 46:43.208
BUT THIS DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE WORMWOOD.

46:43.208 --> 46:44.834
SHE WAS STABBED,
NOT POISONED.

46:44.834 --> 46:46.959
- YOU'RE STILL TOO LATE.
SHE'S ALREADY DEAD.

46:46.959 --> 46:49.458
TRAVIS IS GONE AND YOU KILLED
THE WRONG GUY.

46:49.458 --> 46:51.375
WHEN YOU GONNA LET THIS GO?

46:51.375 --> 46:53.542
- WHEN I KILL TRAVIS.

46:53.542 --> 46:54.917
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

46:54.917 --> 46:56.542
- ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME TO DO?

46:56.542 --> 46:58.291
- I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

46:58.291 --> 47:01.333
- ACCORDING TO YOU,
I DON'T HAVE ONE EITHER.

47:01.333 --> 47:02.792
- WELL, YOU HAVE A CHOICE
TO MAKE RIGHT NOW.

47:02.792 --> 47:05.250
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CALL THE POLICE.

47:05.250 --> 47:07.625
- I TOLD YOU, I DON'T CALL
THE POLICE.

47:07.625 --> 47:09.792
TRAVIS IS MINE.

47:09.792 --> 47:12.250
- DEXTER,
DON'T MAKE THIS PERSONAL.

47:19.667 --> 47:21.625
- METHYLPHOSPHONYL DIFLUORIDE?

47:21.625 --> 47:23.166
- AND ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL.

47:23.166 --> 47:25.625
MIX THEM TOGETHER,
THEY'RE LETHAL.

47:25.625 --> 47:31.125
- POISON GAS.
THIS IS WORMWOOD.

47:31.125 --> 47:33.458
THIS COULD KILL
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE.

47:33.458 --> 47:36.125
- DEXTER, YOU HAVE TO CALL
THE POLICE.

47:36.125 --> 47:38.333
- WHY WOULD I LISTEN TO YOU?
I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE OF YOU.

47:38.333 --> 47:40.542
NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST
YOUR JUDGMENT?

47:40.542 --> 47:42.166
I'LL MAKE MY OWN DECISION.
- DEX.

47:42.166 --> 47:45.875
- LEAVE ME ALONE!

47:51.500 --> 47:53.250
BROTHER SAM SAID IT.

47:53.250 --> 47:55.166
SOMETIMES YOU
HAVE TO SURRENDER

47:55.166 --> 47:57.250
TO SOMETHING GREATER
THAN YOURSELF.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.750
[line trilling]

47:58.750 --> 48:01.375
- 9-1-1.
WHAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY?

48:01.375 --> 48:03.333
- THE DOOMSDAY KILLERS
ARE HIDING OUT ON A YACHT

48:03.333 --> 48:05.875
AT 114 BLEAKER CANAL ROAD.

48:05.875 --> 48:07.417
- AND WHO'S CALLING PLEASE?

48:07.417 --> 48:09.041
- I'D RATHER NOT
LEAVE MY NAME.

48:09.041 --> 48:13.083
HURRY.
THEY HAVE POISON GAS.
