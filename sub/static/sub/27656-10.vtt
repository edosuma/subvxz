WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:02.234
Here you go.

00:02.235 --> 00:03.303
What's this?

00:03.305 --> 00:05.171
Our 10 year anniversary's coming up.

00:05.173 --> 00:06.639
Is this my gift?

00:06.641 --> 00:08.574
Mm mm just a little
contract that I've drawn up

00:08.576 --> 00:11.053
and I invite you, an alleged attorney to

00:11.236 --> 00:12.946
review my proposed deal points.

00:12.948 --> 00:14.147
Deal points of what?

00:14.149 --> 00:15.514
Well, remember when we got married,

00:15.516 --> 00:18.117
I gave you 10 years
together, tops to box?

00:18.119 --> 00:19.352
Yes, I remember.

00:19.354 --> 00:22.188
Well, it's time to renegot...

00:22.190 --> 00:24.923
Wow, as long as we don't
get to use the term renegot

00:24.925 --> 00:25.992
as much as we'd like...

00:25.994 --> 00:27.365
Really? That's surprising.

00:27.390 --> 00:29.256
But I am looking forward to
reviewing your proposed terms.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.763
Wonderful, great!

00:30.779 --> 00:32.762
I'm assuming this is a
standard 10 year contract.

00:32.787 --> 00:36.704
Oh no, it is five
years and just know that

00:37.356 --> 00:38.688
I had to really coax my client

00:38.705 --> 00:40.037
to get the number up that high.

00:40.038 --> 00:43.626
She was pushing for a much lower number.

00:43.666 --> 00:44.687
Your client being you.

00:44.689 --> 00:46.221
Yes, correct.

00:46.223 --> 00:47.456
Ah, ok.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.888
Well uh, says here I get
five boob grabs a week.

00:49.913 --> 00:52.343
I'll be changing that to unlimited.

00:52.368 --> 00:54.635
Alright, I think we
can adjust that as long

00:54.637 --> 00:56.604
as you're willing to
give on a few issues.

00:56.606 --> 00:58.738
Please note deal point number three.

00:58.740 --> 01:01.942
Mike cannot lose his sweet, toned ass.

01:01.967 --> 01:03.060
- Oh boy.
- I mean, at this point

01:03.084 --> 01:06.385
I think it's most of the reason
that we're still together, so.

01:06.401 --> 01:10.602
Wait, I gotta keep my ass
in perfect condition forever?

01:10.604 --> 01:14.006
No, there's obviously a
certain amount of expected

01:14.008 --> 01:16.141
depreciation that's acceptable.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.476
Ok, I get it.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.011
Yeah, my client just needs to know

01:19.013 --> 01:21.047
that certain proactive
steps are being taken

01:21.049 --> 01:22.415
to protect the asset.

01:22.417 --> 01:23.649
Alright, that's reasonable.

01:23.651 --> 01:24.674
Thank you.

01:24.699 --> 01:26.463
But if this is the body area
that we're talking about,

01:26.487 --> 01:29.088
I motion to put in a butt sex addendum

01:29.090 --> 01:31.302
- into this revised contract.
- Really?

01:31.405 --> 01:34.159
Yep, I propose that instead
of the current 36 years

01:34.191 --> 01:36.425
that I have to wait, that
we adjust that number to a

01:36.507 --> 01:38.707
much more reasonable two weeks.

01:38.709 --> 01:40.642
Motion strongly denied.

01:40.644 --> 01:42.945
So you're the lead
prosecutor and the judge?

01:42.947 --> 01:44.479
When it comes to my butt hole,

01:44.481 --> 01:47.416
I am the judge, the
bailiff, the prosecutor.

01:47.418 --> 01:49.451
You're the prosecutest.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.128 --> 02:02.233
If you need me, I will be at my mothers.

02:21.416 --> 02:23.254
How many vests can
you donate to Goodwill

02:23.255 --> 02:26.039
before they're required to
run a background check on you?

02:26.064 --> 02:28.388
Oh, Uncle Harry loved his vests.

02:28.413 --> 02:29.813
I know he did.

02:29.857 --> 02:30.922
You doin' ok?

02:30.924 --> 02:32.724
Yeah, he was 93.

02:32.726 --> 02:34.726
He lived a good life
and he died in his sleep.

02:34.728 --> 02:36.228
What more could you want?

02:36.230 --> 02:37.429
Do we have funeral plans yet?

02:37.431 --> 02:39.598
Well yeah, we'll all go to the cemetery

02:39.600 --> 02:41.800
but he didn't have kids
you know, so I feel like

02:41.802 --> 02:43.326
if we don't do something,
then he won't have

02:43.350 --> 02:44.563
any sort of a memorial.

02:44.652 --> 02:45.670
Yeah, you should do something.

02:45.672 --> 02:47.138
That would be nice for everyone.

02:47.140 --> 02:49.307
I know, but I don't
wanna do it at my house

02:49.309 --> 02:51.410
because I just had Leon's 70th.

02:51.412 --> 02:52.443
We could do it at ours.

02:52.468 --> 02:54.215
- Really?
- Of course, happy to.

02:54.240 --> 02:58.651
I mean, obviously, this means I
am now the matriarch of the family

02:58.676 --> 03:01.046
which leaves you pretty much obsolete.

03:01.088 --> 03:03.221
I mean, we'll throw ya in a pastel hat

03:03.223 --> 03:07.120
and trot you out for parades
but, no one's interested.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.579
Well, I am thrilled to pass the torch.

03:09.604 --> 03:11.204
So, thank you very much.

03:11.229 --> 03:12.855
Great, now we're even
for everything you've

03:12.879 --> 03:14.379
- ever done for me.
- Perfect!

03:14.404 --> 03:15.688
That was easier than I thought.

03:15.713 --> 03:18.047
I'm looking forward to seeing
everybody at the funeral though.

03:18.071 --> 03:19.491
- I know, me too.
- Is that terrible?

03:19.515 --> 03:22.253
No! I feel like when you die at 93,

03:22.278 --> 03:24.077
it's more like a family reunion, right?

03:24.102 --> 03:26.380
Like we're celebrating him.

03:26.405 --> 03:27.514
I'm gonna invite Jennifer.

03:27.539 --> 03:29.141
How is poor Jennifer, by the way?

03:29.515 --> 03:32.076
Why do you have to say poor Jennifer?

03:32.101 --> 03:33.742
Because she's divorced and alone

03:33.767 --> 03:35.346
and she has to take
care of those poor kids.

03:35.370 --> 03:37.084
Now the kids are poor?

03:37.109 --> 03:38.496
- Oh my...
- I'm just saying

03:38.521 --> 03:40.688
I wish that she could
find somebody, that's all.

03:40.703 --> 03:45.706
Oh my gosh, Mom, not everyone
needs a man to be happy, ok?

03:46.190 --> 03:48.547
Although, in this case, she
did just start dating someone

03:48.572 --> 03:50.611
and sounds very ecstatic.

03:50.613 --> 03:51.878
Well, well.

03:51.880 --> 03:57.920
Oh Mom, I think I just found
party favors for the memorial.

03:57.945 --> 03:59.577
Stop fondling his underwear.

03:59.602 --> 04:01.202
Just throw them away.

04:01.227 --> 04:03.501
How is this fondling his underwear?

04:03.526 --> 04:07.361
This would be fondling his underwear.

04:07.363 --> 04:08.506
I'm turning around.

04:08.531 --> 04:10.243
Wouldn't you wanna be
dead and know that someone

04:10.244 --> 04:12.062
was having fun with your underwear?

04:12.087 --> 04:13.197
Oh God.

04:13.222 --> 04:14.889
Dare to dream.

04:20.445 --> 04:22.411
- I loved Uncle Harry.
- I know, he was the best.

04:22.413 --> 04:23.813
The funeral's on Saturday.

04:23.815 --> 04:25.886
I'm actually having the
memorial at my house after.

04:26.012 --> 04:29.306
Wow, you're like a real grown up lady.

04:29.331 --> 04:30.798
I know, thank you!

04:30.914 --> 04:33.047
I'm like the Dowager Warren.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.407
This is like what my mom
and my aunts used to do.

04:35.426 --> 04:38.394
Alright, can we just
get to the issue at hand?

04:38.396 --> 04:41.096
I'm not interested in chatting
with you or seeing you.

04:41.098 --> 04:43.899
I'm only agreed to this
meeting to hear about

04:43.901 --> 04:47.354
- a one Josh.
- You're such an asshole.

04:47.379 --> 04:49.195
I would love to.

04:49.220 --> 04:50.378
So he's pretty great.

04:50.403 --> 04:51.403
Ok.

04:51.428 --> 04:52.434
He's 46.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.942
A perfect age.

04:53.967 --> 04:55.133
He's British.

04:55.807 --> 04:56.807
I know.

04:57.093 --> 04:58.826
He's also divorced, which is good.

04:58.828 --> 05:00.228
That's good.

05:00.230 --> 05:02.130
And the sex is like...

05:04.455 --> 05:05.504
Not good?

05:05.529 --> 05:07.655
No it's amazing.

05:10.973 --> 05:12.821
Please sit down in my office.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.836
I'm gonna just quickly text Mike,

05:14.852 --> 05:17.295
let him know that I will not
be home for dinner tonight.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.821
Alright, when you say amazing,

05:19.823 --> 05:21.977
what are we talking about here?

05:22.002 --> 05:25.394
I feel like that term gets
thrown around with abandon.

05:25.396 --> 05:27.996
Every time to completion.

05:29.097 --> 05:30.415
Three to four times a night.

05:32.236 --> 05:33.472
- What?
- A night.

05:33.964 --> 05:35.670
What are you saying to me?

05:35.792 --> 05:37.410
Oh my God, ok.

05:37.435 --> 05:39.167
How is he with the C job?

05:39.169 --> 05:40.502
Let's get into that.

05:40.504 --> 05:41.637
What is a C job?

05:41.639 --> 05:42.838
Lady oral.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.573
Also, one of my favorite
characters from Pride and Prejudice.

05:45.575 --> 05:46.842
He's really, he's good.

05:46.844 --> 05:48.337
He's confident.

05:48.496 --> 05:49.982
Great, great.

05:50.007 --> 05:51.241
What can I say?

05:51.266 --> 05:54.884
'Cause that, ya know, can be a
difficult terrain to navigate.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.122
Yes it can.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.376
I mean, a dick is like New York.

05:58.432 --> 06:00.599
It just jumps out at you, ya know?

06:00.601 --> 06:02.567
Everywhere you go, you're
gonna have a good time.

06:02.569 --> 06:05.370
But the vagina is more like LA.

06:05.372 --> 06:07.606
It's like there's a lot
of great neighborhoods,

06:07.608 --> 06:11.043
but they're harder to
find and it's really nice

06:11.045 --> 06:12.526
to have a local walk you through them.

06:12.741 --> 06:13.748
That's a good one.

06:13.781 --> 06:15.376
Do you think it's enough
for a dissertation?

06:15.400 --> 06:17.161
Oh, I will say,

06:17.186 --> 06:18.435
his penis...

06:18.448 --> 06:20.355
Everything you say
from that point forward,

06:20.380 --> 06:21.504
I'm going to enjoy.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.339
Just know that walking
into this sentence.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.607
Ok, thank you.

06:25.222 --> 06:28.699
So, he had like a dicey circumcision.

06:29.183 --> 06:30.310
Dicey?

06:30.525 --> 06:32.652
I don't love that
coupled with circumcision.

06:32.677 --> 06:34.877
It just look, it's diff,
it just looks different.

06:34.902 --> 06:37.035
Does it like have a scar?

06:37.060 --> 06:40.248
No, it's more like, so the foreskin
was not totally like circumcized,

06:40.538 --> 06:44.373
so it's cut kind of at a slant.

06:44.375 --> 06:47.266
So it's like it's
wearing a little hoodie?

06:47.291 --> 06:48.591
- Yes!
- Ok.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.225
- Basically.
- Alright, I like it.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.347
Yeah. It's like a hipster dick.

06:52.349 --> 06:53.982
Exactly.

06:53.984 --> 06:55.717
I like British people.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.520
- You...
- Is there an inn?

06:57.854 --> 06:59.120
You're not invited.

06:59.122 --> 07:01.889
But know, I will be there anyway.

07:01.914 --> 07:03.246
In spirit.

07:03.392 --> 07:04.392
Ok.

07:04.417 --> 07:10.154
I'll be at the foot of your
bed just cheering you on.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.568
- To the flop.
- It's up to you.

07:12.593 --> 07:14.473
Are you in?

07:14.505 --> 07:15.572
Oh actually, yeah, I'm in.

07:15.574 --> 07:16.909
That's a tally.

07:16.910 --> 07:17.910
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

07:17.935 --> 07:20.038
- No, I'm all in!
- Oh honey, hey, by the way,

07:20.070 --> 07:21.470
can you drop Amelia off at school.

07:21.472 --> 07:24.005
It's pajama day, so in theory,
she should be ready faster.

07:24.030 --> 07:25.260
Pajama day, eh?

07:25.285 --> 07:26.980
- Yeah.
- What's the teacher wearing?

07:27.004 --> 07:28.203
Oh, Mr. Castellotti?

07:28.368 --> 07:29.868
Already still onboard.

07:29.870 --> 07:32.504
Well, in my dream, just a
mustache and a jean jacket.

07:32.506 --> 07:34.820
- Ok yes, I can take Amelia.
- Thank you.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.836
I need to pick up my
uncle's ashes by 8:30.

07:36.861 --> 07:37.890
I don't wanna be late.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.947
I don't wanna be
responsible for a backup

07:39.972 --> 07:41.471
in the people oven.

07:41.496 --> 07:43.153
Wait a minute. So your
house is just gonna be filled

07:43.177 --> 07:44.430
with mourners this weekend?

07:44.455 --> 07:46.187
Yeah, like your bed.

07:46.212 --> 07:48.480
Ya know, because women
are very sad to be there.

07:48.505 --> 07:51.106
Also, I like to imagine you dead.

07:51.173 --> 07:53.461
Wait, so I'm dead and women
still wanna have sex with me?

07:53.485 --> 07:55.063
No, that's good, that's great!

07:55.088 --> 07:57.127
Wait, why are people having
sex with Brandon's ghost?

07:57.151 --> 07:58.805
No, not my ghost, my corpse.

07:58.830 --> 08:00.997
My ghost is like floating
above and just jerkin' off.

08:01.156 --> 08:05.051
I'd really love you to speak
at my uncle's service actually.

08:05.353 --> 08:07.554
No, because that's not a sincere offer.

08:07.556 --> 08:09.683
- This isn't?
- That face isn't sincere.

08:09.708 --> 08:12.056
I would love you to speak
at my uncle's service.

08:12.096 --> 08:13.524
We think you'd nail it.

08:13.549 --> 08:15.501
- See, thank you, that's sincere.
- That's sincere.

08:15.517 --> 08:18.540
I mean, if you want actual
sincerity and earnestness,

08:18.565 --> 08:22.443
but if you want a good time...

08:22.468 --> 08:23.491
What?

08:23.516 --> 08:24.634
What is happening?

08:24.659 --> 08:26.092
I don't know.

08:26.117 --> 08:28.751
All I know is I'm a
little giddy because I saw

08:28.776 --> 08:30.442
my friend Jennifer today.

08:30.444 --> 08:31.583
Wait a minute.

08:31.623 --> 08:33.089
Is that the girl you were
supposed to set me up with.

08:33.091 --> 08:34.932
- Yes, it is.
- Is she dating someone now?

08:34.948 --> 08:38.899
I don't know if they're
dating but they fuck.

08:38.924 --> 08:40.038
Ok, stop, what!

08:40.063 --> 08:43.275
They have sex up to four times a night.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.726
Every time to completion.

08:45.751 --> 08:47.918
- We're in a fight.
- I get it.

08:47.943 --> 08:52.093
I spent conservatively 16 hours today
discussing their carnal regiment.

08:52.118 --> 08:53.689
- Uh-huh.
- Girls are the worst.

08:53.713 --> 08:56.005
We like to get into it.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.236
Doesn't four times a night
sound a little exhausting though?

08:58.237 --> 09:00.569
Why don't you just do it
the first time good enough

09:00.594 --> 09:02.152
so you don't have to do it.

09:02.177 --> 09:05.155
All I know is I personally
would love to quadri-bang.

09:05.269 --> 09:07.303
I just, I can't ya know, pull it off.

09:07.328 --> 09:09.882
I'm not attracted enough to you anymore.

09:09.891 --> 09:11.669
- What!
- Jesus.

09:11.694 --> 09:15.265
No honey, I find you very attractive.

09:15.290 --> 09:17.479
You're very handsome.

09:17.504 --> 09:18.725
- Thank you.
- But think about

09:18.726 --> 09:20.299
how attracted you have to be to someone

09:20.323 --> 09:22.489
to gear up for the fourth time.

09:22.514 --> 09:23.544
Yeah, I get it.

09:23.569 --> 09:25.290
I mean, third time, I'm in tears.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.716
Fourth time, isn't that
just kind of assault?

09:27.741 --> 09:28.741
- Yes.
- Yes.

09:28.766 --> 09:30.312
- You're making a good point.
- Thank you!

09:30.332 --> 09:31.732
Whatever they're doing, I don't like it.

09:31.734 --> 09:35.010
I don't know why you have
such judgment about my friend,

09:35.035 --> 09:37.508
who you don't know's, sex life.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.738
Because there's only so
many fucks in the world

09:39.763 --> 09:41.532
and she's taking more than her share.

09:41.548 --> 09:45.217
Ugh God, I really feel for these
poor dead women in your bed.

09:45.219 --> 09:46.351
They're not dead, I'm dead.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.619
You made that up.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.753
I'm the dead one, right?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.037
They're dead inside.

09:50.062 --> 09:51.289
And?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.346
That's fair.

09:52.371 --> 09:53.378
Yeah.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.195
So we're just finishing up.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.430
Should only be a few more minutes.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.800
Oh, no problem. We can
wait, thank you so much.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.803
I don't love the phrase
finishing up at a crematorium.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.667
I mean, are they finishing
up burning the bodies

10:06.691 --> 10:08.707
or finishing up paperwork?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.612
Well, I imagine this is just
where they bring us the cremains.

10:10.636 --> 10:12.977
The cremains?

10:12.979 --> 10:15.223
Yes ma'am, that is the
technical term for it.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.589
Well, I'm happy we're
being very technical.

10:17.614 --> 10:20.215
Do you know what a group of
apes is called, by the way?

10:20.240 --> 10:21.291
Shrewdness.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.164
Yes, how bout a bunch of crows?

10:23.189 --> 10:25.656
- Murder.
- God darn it, you're good.

10:25.665 --> 10:26.680
How did you know that?

10:26.705 --> 10:30.078
Because you've told me
these particular two facts

10:30.103 --> 10:32.470
for the past 30 years of my life.

10:32.472 --> 10:35.058
By the way, I appreciate it but
you didn't have to come today,

10:35.060 --> 10:37.886
I could've handled the cremains myself.

10:37.911 --> 10:39.817
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to help.

10:39.842 --> 10:41.103
Your Uncle Harry was important to me.

10:41.127 --> 10:43.103
I've known him for 50 years.

10:43.316 --> 10:45.717
Awe, that's very sweet.

10:45.719 --> 10:47.649
I'll tell you what's sweet is the way

10:47.650 --> 10:49.888
you're stepping up and
doing this for your mom.

10:49.890 --> 10:51.689
Oh no, this is not me being sweet.

10:51.691 --> 10:53.958
This is just me having
to take care of you both

10:53.960 --> 10:56.561
in your eminent years of decay.

10:56.563 --> 10:58.563
Well in my case, you don't have to worry

10:58.565 --> 11:00.365
because I do not wanna be cremated

11:00.367 --> 11:02.767
and I do not wanna be in a coffin.

11:02.769 --> 11:05.170
Every instinct I have is
telling me not to ask you

11:05.172 --> 11:06.971
what you want done with your body.

11:06.973 --> 11:08.773
It's not crazy, ok?

11:08.775 --> 11:12.043
I wanna be put into a biodegradable bag

11:12.045 --> 11:14.477
and returned to the earth.

11:14.502 --> 11:15.724
Yep, that's actually not insane.

11:15.748 --> 11:16.755
I would do that.

11:16.780 --> 11:18.512
I don't even know what a bag cost.

11:18.575 --> 11:19.993
I'll bet it's under 100 bucks.

11:20.186 --> 11:22.952
- A biodegradable body bag?
- Yeah!

11:22.977 --> 11:25.253
No, Dad, if you want me to
just throw you in any bag,

11:25.278 --> 11:26.610
I can get it under 100 dollars.

11:26.635 --> 11:28.072
No but I'm thinking
get one of those bags

11:28.096 --> 11:29.763
that have the two little handles on it.

11:30.130 --> 11:32.984
In case I'm not really dead,
you can lift me back up.

11:33.009 --> 11:35.066
- Promise?
- A shopping bag?

11:35.076 --> 11:36.909
A Bloomingdale's big brown bag.

11:36.911 --> 11:38.745
I mean, I'll throw
ya in a Bloomey's bag,

11:38.747 --> 11:41.748
but I'm not pullin' ya back
out even if you're alive.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.484
Again, so sorry for the wait.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.018
No, no.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.554
I just need you to confirm your
uncle's information and sign there.

11:48.556 --> 11:50.690
Ok, thank you so much.

11:50.692 --> 11:52.374
Of course, and please, let us know

11:52.375 --> 11:54.127
if there's anything else we can do.

11:54.129 --> 11:55.461
Oh, you're very sweet.

11:55.463 --> 11:57.262
Whoa, good, heavy.

11:57.264 --> 11:58.364
Was he tall?

12:00.135 --> 12:02.035
Actually, he was tall.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.793
Well, that can do it.

12:04.205 --> 12:07.350
Yeah, it's gotta be the long
bones of the leg, the femurs?

12:07.375 --> 12:09.141
Dad, it's not the femur.

12:09.310 --> 12:10.612
Thank you.

12:10.637 --> 12:12.570
You know what they
call a group of femurs?

12:12.595 --> 12:13.661
Your butt hole.

12:13.748 --> 12:14.975
Yeah, your butt hole.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.411
Really? Hmm.

12:18.618 --> 12:21.101
Alright, catering will arrive
while we're at the cemetery.

12:21.126 --> 12:22.959
We got music, we got
flowers, we got chairs.

12:22.984 --> 12:24.516
The bar's all set up.

12:24.518 --> 12:25.520
Thank you.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.564
I put hand towels in the guest bathroom.

12:27.589 --> 12:30.189
Now I'm a person who
thinks about hand towels.

12:30.191 --> 12:31.921
How does my mother do this?

12:31.946 --> 12:33.145
She's a good lady.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.627
Cool your pene, Mike.

12:34.652 --> 12:35.784
Cool your pene.

12:35.809 --> 12:37.127
I'm a little excited though.

12:37.151 --> 12:38.917
Jennifer's bringing her new beau today.

12:38.919 --> 12:39.926
Oh that's right.

12:39.951 --> 12:41.625
- I'm looking forward to meeting him.
- Me too.

12:41.633 --> 12:43.320
I imagine they'll have
just done it in the car,

12:43.344 --> 12:44.744
so I wouldn't shake their hands.

12:44.746 --> 12:45.950
Noted.

12:45.998 --> 12:47.508
By the way, have you
ever heard of someone

12:47.509 --> 12:50.209
getting accidentally half circumcized?

12:50.211 --> 12:51.478
Why?

12:51.480 --> 12:54.948
'Cause apparently only
part of Josh's foreskin

12:54.950 --> 12:57.550
was removed back in the day.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.087
So he's got like, just
like a little hoodie.

13:00.089 --> 13:02.284
I just can't imagine
that Josh appreciates

13:02.309 --> 13:05.247
Jennifer sharing the intimate
details of his genitals with you.

13:05.272 --> 13:06.715
If you're dating a woman,
you should assume that

13:06.739 --> 13:08.814
every one of her friends
knows about your dick.

13:08.816 --> 13:10.827
Really, does Jennifer know about mine?

13:10.852 --> 13:12.660
She knows it's nice.

13:12.685 --> 13:14.366
Well, I'm glad that's
the word on the street.

13:14.390 --> 13:16.023
People are talkin'.

13:16.048 --> 13:17.481
Oh, they're talkin', are they?

13:17.506 --> 13:21.983
Awe, Brian sent me photos of
Amelia and Izzy from pajama day.

13:22.129 --> 13:24.376
Oh my God, these God damn kids are cute!

13:24.401 --> 13:25.934
Yeah, they are cute huh?

13:26.670 --> 13:33.718
Um, did you wear that
fucking tank top to drop off?

13:33.743 --> 13:35.208
Yeah, I went for a work out after.

13:35.233 --> 13:37.233
So you wore it to Amelia's school

13:37.258 --> 13:40.820
where we have to go every
morning of our lives?

13:40.845 --> 13:42.805
I wore a sweatshirt. I
took it off for a minute.

13:43.177 --> 13:44.433
Is this the person you wanna be?

13:44.457 --> 13:47.591
Just guy out in world in tank top?

13:47.670 --> 13:48.735
I don't know.

13:48.737 --> 13:49.836
I like that tank top.

13:49.838 --> 13:50.869
It's comfortable.

13:50.894 --> 13:53.762
Ok, I can't take this on today.

13:53.889 --> 13:55.274
Oh my God.

13:55.299 --> 13:56.384
Well it's a good thing
you'll be surrounded

13:56.385 --> 13:57.820
by friends and family then.

13:57.845 --> 13:59.044
Uh-huh.

13:59.114 --> 14:00.667
- You know what else is good?
- What's good?

14:00.691 --> 14:02.681
That the funeral will be the highlight

14:02.706 --> 14:04.074
of my emotional day.

14:07.174 --> 14:10.713
As we conclude this
portion of the service,

14:10.737 --> 14:15.332
we salute Harold with
a military tribute.

14:15.652 --> 14:19.321
Following, please join the
family for a small reception

14:19.323 --> 14:24.463
at the home of Andrea
Warren and Michael Harris.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.290
Hut!

14:27.625 --> 14:28.625
Forward arm!

14:29.658 --> 14:32.577
Ready, aim, fire!

14:33.554 --> 14:35.372
Aim, fire!

14:36.436 --> 14:38.737
Aim, fire!

14:39.809 --> 14:40.809
Right face.

14:41.678 --> 14:42.844
Forward march.

14:44.948 --> 14:48.756
I'm gonna need a minute to
recover from being shot at.

14:48.993 --> 14:49.993
Oh my God.

14:50.087 --> 14:51.753
Look who I ran into.

14:51.755 --> 14:52.755
Hi!

14:53.557 --> 14:56.389
- Hi, thank you for coming.
- This is Josh.

14:56.414 --> 14:58.088
- This is Mike, Andrea.
- Hi.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.498
Hello.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.179
Sorry to meet you under
these circumstances

15:02.203 --> 15:03.797
but very happy to meet you.

15:03.822 --> 15:05.162
It is very nice to meet you,

15:05.187 --> 15:06.352
thank you for coming as well.

15:06.377 --> 15:07.512
It was really nice actually.

15:07.536 --> 15:08.536
I mean, ya know,

15:08.561 --> 15:09.926
I got to see a lot of
people I haven't seen.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.417
I know, it was nice.

15:11.442 --> 15:13.975
Well I'm gonna go ahead
and run to your house.

15:14.075 --> 15:15.808
Can I pick up something on the way?

15:15.810 --> 15:17.143
No, it's all taken care of.

15:17.145 --> 15:18.168
Oh, thank you.

15:18.193 --> 15:19.232
You're welcome.

15:19.257 --> 15:20.790
Great to see you and

15:20.815 --> 15:22.515
really lovely to meet you.

15:23.550 --> 15:24.883
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye!

15:25.020 --> 15:26.362
We're just gonna head over too, I think.

15:26.386 --> 15:27.952
Ok great, we will see you there.

15:27.977 --> 15:31.846
Josh, I mean, try to
pull your shit together.

15:31.871 --> 15:33.603
Just please, for once.

15:33.628 --> 15:34.628
I'm doing my best.

15:34.653 --> 15:35.985
This is your best?

15:36.030 --> 15:37.296
- I mean, this is it.
- So sorry.

15:37.298 --> 15:39.232
I will be asking to borrow some money

15:39.234 --> 15:40.500
when we get to your home.

15:40.502 --> 15:41.843
Just a warning.

15:41.868 --> 15:43.102
Mike, pull out your checkbook.

15:43.104 --> 15:44.303
I don't wanna make it weird.

15:44.305 --> 15:46.306
Bye, we'll see you there.

15:47.288 --> 15:52.486
I mean, not the sex monster
I was imagining, right?

15:52.591 --> 15:54.324
Four times a night?

15:54.494 --> 15:55.893
He was so sweet.

15:55.918 --> 15:57.348
- Very.
- Right?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.377
Yes, but I like him.

15:58.402 --> 15:59.512
I really liked him.

15:59.537 --> 16:01.097
- Did you see how happy she was?
- Yeah.

16:02.513 --> 16:03.870
But was there even
one second you weren't

16:03.894 --> 16:04.901
thinking about his dick?

16:04.926 --> 16:06.059
Be honest.

16:06.084 --> 16:07.306
No.

16:07.346 --> 16:09.623
Ha, now you know what it's
like to be one of the girls.

16:09.648 --> 16:11.515
Chit chattin' about the goods.

16:16.651 --> 16:18.384
- Dad.
- Hi honey.

16:18.442 --> 16:21.278
- Oh, you made it.
- I did, indeed.

16:21.309 --> 16:24.071
Listen, you did a wonderful,
wonderful job here.

16:24.096 --> 16:25.229
Thank you.

16:25.254 --> 16:27.167
- Harry would've loved this.
- Well, don't worry.

16:27.183 --> 16:29.654
For yours, I'll ya know,
make sure I have some

16:29.679 --> 16:32.607
stripper poles strategically
placed around the party.

16:33.462 --> 16:34.743
If you were gonna go into a casket,

16:34.767 --> 16:37.035
I could say you would
just slide right on in.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.061
Yeah, well if you had
the stripper poles,

16:38.085 --> 16:41.379
I have a few people I
could audition for extras

16:41.404 --> 16:42.816
in a situation like that.

16:42.857 --> 16:44.123
- By the way...
- This has taken a turn.

16:44.125 --> 16:47.760
I put together this,
it's a photo montage

16:47.762 --> 16:50.797
that you can play while
people are talking.

16:50.799 --> 16:52.565
How many photos of Mom's Uncle Harry

16:52.567 --> 16:54.333
could you possibly have?

16:54.335 --> 16:56.803
Not a ton, but ya know, who cares?

16:56.805 --> 16:59.072
So, it's gonna be like
what, seven photos on a loop?

16:59.097 --> 17:01.677
- Yeah.
- Alright, I'll put it on.

17:01.702 --> 17:03.369
Ok, I'm gonna get a sandwich.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.589
Ok, you don't have to
say it like it's a secret.

17:06.829 --> 17:08.362
Anyone can get a sandwich.

17:08.683 --> 17:10.383
Mom, I'm gonna gather everyone up.

17:10.385 --> 17:12.819
Some people wanna say a few things.

17:12.820 --> 17:14.434
Andrea, thanks so much for hosting.

17:14.459 --> 17:15.893
Oh my God, my pleasure.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.483
Your house is so beautiful.

17:17.758 --> 17:19.558
I can't wait to have my memorial here.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.569
- Oh, God forbid.
- Well what?

17:21.594 --> 17:23.673
I'm about to turn 75.

17:23.698 --> 17:24.797
Well I'm not far behind you.

17:24.799 --> 17:25.999
Well, I wouldn't say that.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.701
I might have a few more good years.

17:28.703 --> 17:31.908
Hopefully more than a few.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.512
Ya know, even at 90 and 93,
my mother and Uncle Harry

17:39.514 --> 17:41.109
always kept us laughing.

17:41.134 --> 17:43.167
That's a wipe dissolve.

17:44.853 --> 17:46.118
What?

17:46.120 --> 17:48.055
Don't you remember that?

17:48.080 --> 17:51.481
But sadly, they were the
last of that generation.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.568
So Bob, Sharon, looks like we're next.

17:59.362 --> 18:01.428
Honey, Uncle Russ is
getting ready to leave.

18:01.453 --> 18:02.719
Wants to say goodbye.

18:02.937 --> 18:05.004
Ok, I will be out in a second.

18:05.006 --> 18:06.939
- Everything alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

18:06.941 --> 18:08.474
Ya sure?

18:08.476 --> 18:10.101
You're gonna die.

18:10.126 --> 18:11.425
Jesus!

18:11.450 --> 18:13.127
Ok well, I don't know if he's gonna help

18:13.152 --> 18:14.972
but I guess it's worth a Hail Mary.

18:14.997 --> 18:16.997
Are you just realizing this today?

18:17.022 --> 18:19.690
No, obviously, I know this but it's,

18:19.715 --> 18:21.544
now that you're next up, I mean,

18:21.569 --> 18:23.109
what the hell am I supposed to be doing?

18:23.133 --> 18:24.363
Honey, you're more than capable

18:24.387 --> 18:25.735
of taking care of yourself.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.807
Of course I am, don't be insane.

18:27.831 --> 18:28.831
I just,

18:31.327 --> 18:34.328
I'm gonna miss you, you dick.

18:34.353 --> 18:36.485
- That is so sweet.
- No it's not.

18:36.510 --> 18:39.216
I'm just saying, I refuse
to start replacing you.

18:39.241 --> 18:41.241
So, pull out your china.

18:41.266 --> 18:43.400
Get your silverware polished.

18:43.425 --> 18:44.724
Start throwing the parties.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.985
Honey, you have no choice.

18:46.010 --> 18:48.215
- Yes, I do have a choice!
- This is why I had kids.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.685
That's why you had kids?

18:49.710 --> 18:51.276
Because when I really start to go,

18:51.301 --> 18:52.934
I'm moving in here with you and Mike

18:52.959 --> 18:55.426
and he's gonna give me sponge baths.

18:55.451 --> 18:57.918
Ugh, I wanna be horrified

18:57.943 --> 19:00.343
but I think he would enjoy that.

19:00.461 --> 19:03.663
Mom, I don't understand why
you are not more worked up

19:03.665 --> 19:05.230
about this than I am.

19:05.255 --> 19:07.989
You're the one that's
ya know, on your way out.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.215
Well obviously the thought
of growing old is shit,

19:10.240 --> 19:11.873
but since the alternative is dying,

19:11.898 --> 19:13.531
I guess I'll just go with it.

19:13.556 --> 19:14.793
I don't love it.

19:14.818 --> 19:17.921
Well, you're the one who was
always joking about me dying.

19:17.946 --> 19:19.878
Yeah that was before I remembered

19:19.880 --> 19:21.914
how God damn old you are.

19:21.916 --> 19:23.787
- Thank you.
- I'll be honest.

19:23.812 --> 19:26.012
I didn't think I loved
you as much as I do.

19:26.287 --> 19:28.723
- I don't believe anybody did.
- I knew.

19:28.748 --> 19:30.948
Well, you know what's gonna
come as a surprise to you?

19:31.287 --> 19:32.892
When I won't change your diapers

19:32.894 --> 19:35.494
and you gotta find another way.

19:35.496 --> 19:37.964
Huh, I think I've
thought of another way.

19:37.966 --> 19:39.246
Don't say Mike.

19:39.271 --> 19:41.449
I think maybe Mike would
be really good at that.

19:41.474 --> 19:44.077
Ok, I'm starting to find
a path through my grief.

19:44.102 --> 19:45.183
So thank you.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.482
No problem!

19:46.507 --> 19:47.573
My pleasure.

19:47.575 --> 19:49.651
Your parting gift to me.

19:49.676 --> 19:51.585
My dying gift to my daughter.

19:51.610 --> 19:54.211
Cool, alright, I'm
gonna go say my goodbyes.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.714
Give the people a glimpse
of their new queen.

19:56.739 --> 19:59.729
Well I'm just glad I got a glimpse
of Jennifer's new boyfriend.

19:59.754 --> 20:01.499
I wanna know everything
that's going on there.

20:01.523 --> 20:04.326
I don't know if you
wanna know everything.

20:04.351 --> 20:05.683
Oh, now I think I do.

20:05.708 --> 20:06.715
What?

20:06.740 --> 20:08.747
Let's just say there was a bit of a

20:08.772 --> 20:11.307
botched circumcision situation.

20:11.332 --> 20:14.546
- They left a little on the top.
- Oh my goodness.

20:14.602 --> 20:16.521
Well, every penis is
different, you know?

20:16.546 --> 20:20.809
I mean, you know Leon's, it's
very long but it's very thin.

20:22.918 --> 20:23.918
Oh God.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.565
I just wasn't prepared
to get that emotional

20:31.590 --> 20:32.890
about my mom today.

20:32.892 --> 20:34.057
It just came out of nowhere.

20:34.059 --> 20:35.341
I just fell apart.

20:35.349 --> 20:37.389
Well it's hard not to think
about that stuff at funerals.

20:37.413 --> 20:39.848
I know, but I was living
such a carefree life

20:39.850 --> 20:42.417
before my Uncle fucking Russ
opened his God damn mouth

20:42.419 --> 20:44.786
about his generation's bullshit.

20:44.788 --> 20:47.788
Again, I support your choice not
to have spoken at the service.

20:47.790 --> 20:49.190
I think people were disappointed.

20:49.192 --> 20:51.993
I just don't want my mom to die.

20:51.995 --> 20:54.029
Is that terrible to say?

20:54.031 --> 20:55.836
Look, I think it makes
your mom feel good

20:55.861 --> 20:57.694
knowing she could pass
the torch off to you.

20:57.719 --> 20:59.185
Ugh, well I'm not interested.

20:59.336 --> 21:01.999
How soon before I can pass
the torch off to Amelia?

21:02.024 --> 21:04.078
- When she's eight?
- It was a nice memorial though.

21:04.103 --> 21:05.869
Yeah, it was really nice.

21:05.894 --> 21:07.494
I think everyone had a very good time.

21:07.519 --> 21:10.351
And we got to meet Josh's...

21:10.376 --> 21:11.470
No, I'm out.

21:11.495 --> 21:12.538
You're out?

21:12.563 --> 21:14.696
Yep, I've seen the light.

21:14.721 --> 21:15.920
What?

21:15.945 --> 21:17.945
My mother gleefully
shared something to me

21:18.021 --> 21:22.023
that I can never repeat,
nor will I ever un-know.

21:22.025 --> 21:25.460
And now, I see the error of my ways.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.048
- What was it?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

21:27.067 --> 21:28.433
Oh come on, you gotta tell me.

21:28.435 --> 21:29.611
You don't wanna now.

21:29.636 --> 21:30.835
I do wanna know.

21:30.837 --> 21:33.604
Leon's got a long, slender penis.

21:37.825 --> 21:38.857
Oh my God.

21:38.882 --> 21:39.882
Mm-hmm.

21:42.281 --> 21:43.281
Yeah.

21:44.016 --> 21:45.282
And that goes

21:45.284 --> 21:47.517
inside my mother.

21:51.624 --> 21:52.657
That sucks.

21:58.631 --> 21:59.617
And I understand you're celebrating

21:59.618 --> 22:01.432
an anniversary tonight, congratulations.

22:01.434 --> 22:03.568
- Oh thank you.
- Yes, we are.

22:03.570 --> 22:04.635
Your waiter will be right with you.

22:04.637 --> 22:06.437
- Thank you.
- Oh my God.

22:06.439 --> 22:07.972
This looks fabulous.

22:07.974 --> 22:09.574
Yeah, I love this restaurant.

22:09.576 --> 22:11.976
What's going on there with the shirt?

22:11.978 --> 22:13.510
What?

22:13.512 --> 22:14.778
Is that your jammies?

22:14.780 --> 22:17.615
I just assumed this is
what we're doing now.

22:17.617 --> 22:19.516
We just ya know, we wear
stuff that's comfortable.

22:19.518 --> 22:21.252
We're not worried about
impressing each other.

22:21.254 --> 22:22.819
Ya know, like your tank top

22:22.821 --> 22:26.390
or this extremely comfortable shirt.

22:26.392 --> 22:29.026
You're wearing that to our
anniversary dinner to make a point?

22:29.028 --> 22:30.250
- Uh-huh.
- About my tank top?

22:30.275 --> 22:32.565
Mm-hmm. I did.

22:32.932 --> 22:35.666
Well uh, you know people
are looking at you right now.

22:35.668 --> 22:38.201
Great, let them look.

22:38.203 --> 22:39.470
Let them feast their eyes

22:39.472 --> 22:42.073
on a woman who's given up.

22:42.075 --> 22:43.874
Yeah, well, before you give up on life,

22:43.876 --> 22:45.542
why don't you open your gift.

22:45.544 --> 22:46.677
I would love to.

22:46.679 --> 22:48.045
Here, press play.

22:48.047 --> 22:50.481
- What?
- Just do it.

22:50.483 --> 22:53.050
Hey honey, it's August 21st,
2018 and I am purchasing

22:53.052 --> 22:56.487
this horrific tank top with the
sole purpose of fucking with you.

22:56.489 --> 22:58.081
My gift to you. I love you.

22:58.106 --> 22:59.506
Happy anniversary.

23:03.162 --> 23:04.562
This was a bid.

23:04.564 --> 23:05.963
This was a bid.

23:07.433 --> 23:10.367
And now, I have won anniversaries.

23:10.369 --> 23:13.007
Ok, holy shit.

23:13.238 --> 23:15.706
What is happening right now?

23:15.708 --> 23:17.841
The pajama date photo?

23:17.843 --> 23:18.876
That was staged?

23:18.878 --> 23:21.312
Yeah, Brian helped me.

23:21.314 --> 23:24.515
I'm gonna have sex with
you four times tonight.

23:24.517 --> 23:25.650
Oh wow.

23:25.652 --> 23:27.488
So just know that that's coming at you.

23:28.597 --> 23:32.769
How happy were you
when I took my coat off

23:32.975 --> 23:35.293
and was wearing this monstrosity?

23:35.295 --> 23:38.061
Honestly? That could
not have gone better.

23:38.063 --> 23:39.404
Oh my God.

23:39.866 --> 23:42.065
Fuck, I love you.

23:42.067 --> 23:43.467
I love you too.

23:43.469 --> 23:46.937
This was six months of fury you gave me.

23:46.939 --> 23:48.339
Oh, so worth it.

23:51.349 --> 23:54.277
I am gonna put my coat
back on now because

23:54.785 --> 23:55.913
people are looking.

23:55.915 --> 23:57.481
Yeah, they are.

24:01.220 --> 24:05.356
Um, what was that move
you did back there?

24:05.358 --> 24:08.159
Were you trying to
have sex with my butt?

24:08.161 --> 24:09.168
Maybe.

24:09.193 --> 24:11.940
No, you got 36 more
years to wait, my friend.

24:11.965 --> 24:13.764
Contracts have wiggle room.

24:13.766 --> 24:15.432
Wiggle room?

24:15.434 --> 24:17.434
Are you actually an attorney?

24:17.436 --> 24:19.570
I just thought after my amazing present

24:19.572 --> 24:22.173
that if I ever had a
chance, it'd be tonight.

24:22.175 --> 24:25.375
You know what, I understand
and appreciate that instinct

24:25.400 --> 24:28.200
but keep your dick out of my butt.

24:29.151 --> 24:30.885
- That's fair.
- Thank you.
