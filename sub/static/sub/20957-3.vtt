WEBVTT

00:00.071 --> 00:01.351
Previously on Wynonna Earp...

00:01.377 --> 00:03.473
This condo's being
built on an old school.

00:03.475 --> 00:06.369
- Anything original still left?
- A few nooks and crannies.

00:06.402 --> 00:09.196
Demons... they do exist.
And now I kill them.

00:09.212 --> 00:10.517
This night wouldn't be complete

00:10.544 --> 00:12.903
without a hellish road
trip through my childhood.

00:13.729 --> 00:15.965
It's alright to miss him, Wynonna.

00:15.979 --> 00:18.751
She's my sister, Nicole. I have
to protect her now more than ever.

00:18.782 --> 00:20.735
I just wanna make sure
you're Okay, that deep down,

00:20.751 --> 00:22.751
- you're still my Waverly.
- Totally.

00:23.253 --> 00:25.754
I'm afraid the scary's just beginning.

00:25.856 --> 00:29.892
Why is she haunting me?

- I didn't know if it was your thing.

01:21.955 --> 01:23.782
Baby, that's...

01:24.264 --> 01:26.404
- that's everybody's thing.
- Yeah?

01:26.445 --> 01:28.376
Yeah. The cross-eyed hooligans

01:28.403 --> 01:30.951
at the Homecoming
game are gonna love it.

01:30.996 --> 01:32.893
No, silly.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.925
No, this is a private show for you,

01:37.481 --> 01:40.973
before you have to go off on patrol...

01:41.047 --> 01:42.999
Nedley figures the streets

01:43.031 --> 01:45.672
are gonna be awash with booze and urine

01:45.792 --> 01:48.887
all weekend. So it's all hands on deck.

01:49.218 --> 01:51.201
You guys need to get some more hands,

01:51.321 --> 01:55.384
so that yours can
stay right here. On me.

01:59.005 --> 02:00.919
Okay. Ready?

02:01.727 --> 02:03.888
Time for one more cheer!

02:03.921 --> 02:07.941
- Come on, boys, from here to there...
- Girl, put on some underwear!

02:07.968 --> 02:10.448
Wynonna! Hi...

02:11.434 --> 02:12.566
Just...

02:13.147 --> 02:14.744
passing through.

02:16.306 --> 02:18.565
You guys can resume
your panty-less roleplay.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.731
You know what? I gotta get to work.

02:21.189 --> 02:23.221
- You gonna come by?
- Hanging from afar

02:23.223 --> 02:25.970
while my lady works? That's my jam.

02:26.159 --> 02:27.290
Okay.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.387
Yeah.

02:33.229 --> 02:35.390
So, now that I know
your whole situation,

02:35.902 --> 02:38.732
should we institute a knickers-
on-the-doorknob policy?

02:39.039 --> 02:41.108
Since you're not using yours.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.283
Wow. Rough night?

02:44.622 --> 02:46.579
No, I just can't stop seeing it.

02:46.972 --> 02:48.804
The gory ritual, the broken seal.

02:48.826 --> 02:51.973
It's just, every time I close
my eyes, it's the same nightmare.

02:51.995 --> 02:54.447
Right, but nothing else
has... happened, right?

02:55.024 --> 02:56.387
Yet.

02:57.476 --> 03:00.257
- I forgot you were head cheerleader.
- And Prom Queen.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.380
Prom. That's that thing people do

03:02.402 --> 03:05.297
when they're not institutionalized
at 14, right? That sounds nice.

03:05.299 --> 03:07.144
Are you going to be
this much fun all day?

03:07.694 --> 03:09.947
Maybe I'll just skedaddle, you know,

03:09.958 --> 03:12.609
leave you at the mercy of
monsters, go on the I am.

03:12.729 --> 03:15.751
- What is a I am, anyway?
- Still no sign of Dolls, huh.

03:16.143 --> 03:18.122
And I don't expect one.

03:25.184 --> 03:27.187
You've polished the shaft hard enough.

03:27.307 --> 03:29.516
You so rarely hear that.

03:29.715 --> 03:32.274
I need to be ready. It's Homecoming.

03:32.826 --> 03:35.209
I might have to protect the people
who tortured me in high school.

03:35.222 --> 03:38.876
- They weren't all bad.
- No, they were champs. Every one.

03:43.759 --> 03:45.882
All for this?

03:46.512 --> 03:49.504
- I was such an idiot.
- The time has come.

03:50.301 --> 03:52.850
I come to claim what's mine.

04:16.603 --> 04:19.899
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I've got to give ♪

04:19.930 --> 04:22.040

04:36.088 --> 04:37.268
I'll check his ID...

04:37.549 --> 04:38.847
Bryce Cooper.

04:39.419 --> 04:41.461
Star right wing of the '07 champs.

04:41.495 --> 04:44.193
The last Purgatory High School
team to not only win the cup,

04:44.231 --> 04:46.698
but a single game. I'm
gonna pass this off.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.960
To Black Badge? This is
straight up homicide. It's ours.

04:50.080 --> 04:53.011
We've got people coming home
from all over for the game.

04:53.070 --> 04:54.918
If this news gets out,
it'll be pandemonium.

04:54.941 --> 04:56.455
Just examine the scene, then scrub it.

04:56.523 --> 04:57.921
You mean cover it up?

04:58.892 --> 05:00.595
Tomato, potato.

05:00.961 --> 05:04.821
Earp?

05:25.940 --> 05:29.210
- Restocking already?
- They say liquor sells itself.

05:29.212 --> 05:31.950
Bet the sight of you
pourin' it don't hurt either.

05:32.445 --> 05:34.860
How does our latest cocktail progress?

05:34.871 --> 05:37.267
- It doesn't.
- If you need more, I'll open another.

05:37.290 --> 05:40.691
- Not more. Different. Yours isn't right.
- Clock is ticking, Rosita.

05:40.724 --> 05:42.599
What do you want me to
do? We need something pure.

05:43.235 --> 05:44.793
And more tequila.

05:56.230 --> 05:59.697
- What can I get ya? Spritzer?
- Whoa, you're...

06:00.635 --> 06:03.111
Uh, just looking for the boss man.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.772
So no spritzer then.

06:05.047 --> 06:06.411
- Wynonna!
- Excuse me?

06:06.476 --> 06:09.333
Is Henry here or...?

06:09.590 --> 06:13.234
- Wynonna! BITCH!!
- Hey, Mercedes.

06:13.789 --> 06:15.740
Oh... working.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.058
Who isn't?

06:22.952 --> 06:25.066
So, how are you settling in?

06:25.068 --> 06:26.929
How are Beth and Tucker?

06:26.999 --> 06:28.858
My siblings are acting like I moved home

06:28.879 --> 06:32.869
to ruin their Grey Gardens
spiral into reclusive weirdoness.

06:33.104 --> 06:33.977
Which I did.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.621
Every family tree's
got its share of nuts.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.580
Speaking of nuts.

06:40.931 --> 06:42.962
When's the last time you
had your hands on some?

06:42.986 --> 06:45.702
Seriously? That's your pitch?

06:45.822 --> 06:48.460
Perry Needs-to-get-an-actual-
personality Crofte?

06:48.492 --> 06:50.869
Like you never snuck
into the locker room

06:50.894 --> 06:54.111
- to sniff his jock strap.
- Never into jocks.

06:54.172 --> 06:56.015
Now straps...

06:56.600 --> 07:00.886
How 'bout your broken heart?
Yeah, I can sniff that from here.

07:00.937 --> 07:03.118
It makes my nostrils sad.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.150
Uh,

07:05.350 --> 07:08.675
Perry was besties with
that Bryce guy, right?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.424
I don't know. Why are
you asking me? Hey! Perry!

07:11.448 --> 07:13.648
- Hey, shh!
- Perry, hi! Come on over!

07:13.844 --> 07:15.407
- Shut up.
- Here he comes.

07:15.455 --> 07:17.819
- Why?
- You remember Wynonna?

07:18.738 --> 07:20.036
Oh!

07:20.063 --> 07:22.690
- The girl everyone was scared of.
- Even you?

07:22.692 --> 07:25.474
There were rumours, I guess
'cause your dad and sister...

07:25.732 --> 07:27.473
You had a breakdown.

07:27.532 --> 07:29.623
That didn't do it for you, huh?

07:29.650 --> 07:32.716
- Try not to slide off your stool.
- How long you around?

07:33.605 --> 07:35.745
Uh, permanently.

07:37.011 --> 07:38.873
Good talk, Per. I hate you.

07:41.010 --> 07:42.740
So, what's her deal?

07:43.139 --> 07:45.322
She looks, um... good.

07:45.780 --> 07:47.068
She's doing good.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.383
- Some kind of special detective.
- For what?

07:50.889 --> 07:52.895
Stuff the cops can't handle.

07:53.089 --> 07:55.013
Any chance I can get her number?

07:55.746 --> 07:57.756
What am I, human Tinder?

08:00.618 --> 08:02.715
- There you are.
- Here I be.

08:05.968 --> 08:08.475
One of the guys from the '07 team.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.692
Champs?

08:10.398 --> 08:11.616
Hockey?

08:12.371 --> 08:14.123
Wow. Never mind.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.632
Somebody -or something-
tore out his liver.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.841
I wonder if it's connected
to our symbol-smasher.

08:19.884 --> 08:21.922
We also still have a dozen new demons

08:21.943 --> 08:24.088
flooded the triangle to
round up for Black Badge.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.303
It's a rich tapestry of awful.

08:31.234 --> 08:33.056
She seems super smart.

08:33.099 --> 08:34.957
She's the best mixologist around.

08:34.969 --> 08:38.919
Ooh... Bet she shakes
in all the right places.

08:39.571 --> 08:42.342
I love that you've got your
own thing going on here,

08:42.380 --> 08:43.743
but don't get distracted.

08:43.748 --> 08:46.908
If you need me on a case, you
have my undivided attention.

08:47.181 --> 08:48.630
Okay.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.785
Look, I was up half the
night. Buried alive in dread.

08:55.879 --> 08:58.454
- Mm, no.
- Abstaining, are we?

08:58.988 --> 09:03.046
Two shots of tequila is not abstaining.
It's called being a professional.

09:03.094 --> 09:06.069
Back in my day, that meant
something else entirely.

09:07.368 --> 09:09.897
Okay. I'm heading to work.

09:09.899 --> 09:12.934
- See if Jeremy's made any progress.
- Shall I accompany you?

09:13.436 --> 09:15.527
Don't you need to babysit

09:15.572 --> 09:17.435
your 'professional' mixologist?

09:23.654 --> 09:26.301
So, this broken seal
on the school chapel:

09:26.333 --> 09:29.378
I've been able to puzzle certain
designs of what looks to be

09:29.399 --> 09:31.275
some kind of ancient symbol.

09:31.297 --> 09:33.825
Soon I'll have enough to
start cross-referencing it

09:33.841 --> 09:35.382
with similar archaic patterns

09:35.388 --> 09:37.641
- and look into what it might mean.
- "Looks to be?"

09:37.673 --> 09:39.709
"Soon?" "Might?" Pretty weak.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.753
What about big dead Bryce?

09:41.873 --> 09:43.510
Nicole pass on the evidence?

09:43.630 --> 09:45.665
Oh, do you mean "forensics"?

09:45.785 --> 09:47.234
Don't air quote, that's my thing.

09:47.261 --> 09:49.880
And is Officer Haught
always so passive-aggressive

09:49.891 --> 09:51.853
when handing off cases to BBD?

09:53.313 --> 09:56.426
None of my business, like
everything else around here,

09:56.455 --> 09:59.134
- yeah, got it.
- Any connection to our symbol-smasher?

09:59.171 --> 10:01.036
I don't see one.

10:01.224 --> 10:04.318
But it's no simple murder either.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.797
The victim's liver was harvested,

10:06.830 --> 10:09.066
but he had no opioids in his system.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.947
And no defensive wounds.

10:11.335 --> 10:14.682
- It's like he let it happen.
- Or he ripped it out himself.

10:16.779 --> 10:20.452
- Where's Lucado?
- Called away. On a personal matter.

10:21.864 --> 10:24.572
Has, uh, Dolls reached
out to you at all?

10:24.574 --> 10:28.210
- Nice try, but snitches get stitches.
- I'm not...

10:28.688 --> 10:30.357
Okay, never mind.

10:30.392 --> 10:32.845
And next time, tell
Officer Haught to please

10:32.897 --> 10:35.341
close the victim's eyes. It's creepy.

10:35.359 --> 10:36.622
He's staring right at it.

10:36.686 --> 10:38.739
- Staring at what?
- The trophy case.

10:38.946 --> 10:40.900
Champs 2007 and all that.

10:45.574 --> 10:47.346
Oh yeah, you are.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.991
Hello?

10:55.564 --> 10:56.891
Perry Crofte?

10:57.674 --> 10:59.815
I was just thinking about you.

10:59.853 --> 11:01.927
After all these years,
we're finally in sync.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.291
Like a sorority's monthly cycles.

11:05.683 --> 11:08.900
- I haven't had any fun in a long time.
- Okay...

11:09.853 --> 11:11.693
Are you asking me out?

11:11.694 --> 11:13.409
- One hundred percent.
- Great.

11:13.763 --> 11:15.229
We can chat.

11:17.001 --> 11:19.087
Uh, should I pick you up...

11:19.207 --> 11:20.536
No, I'll pick you up.

11:20.730 --> 11:22.178
Same place? Out in the boonies?

11:22.196 --> 11:24.053
Some things never change, huh?

11:24.054 --> 11:25.412
I hope that's not true.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.597
- Bye!
- Bye.

11:34.577 --> 11:37.362
Yep. Totally in sync.

11:53.653 --> 11:55.762
Scarlett Tart? Or Pink Tease?

11:55.818 --> 11:58.469
Flaming Ladybug? Wait,
which skit are we doing?

11:58.589 --> 12:00.616
The one where we debate which
lipstick I should borrow.

12:00.823 --> 12:02.854
Ah, Okay...

12:02.884 --> 12:05.968
So it is a date date, huh?

12:06.244 --> 12:07.382
Where's he taking ya?

12:07.409 --> 12:10.578
- Under the bleachers?
- Hey, watch your perfectly glossed mouth.

12:10.698 --> 12:11.984
Bryce and Perry were teammates.

12:12.010 --> 12:13.911
Maybe Perry knows
something. It's a cover.

12:13.932 --> 12:15.903
Sure, wink.

12:16.239 --> 12:18.804
Like how I'm going on
"patrol" with Nicole.

12:20.305 --> 12:23.296
Look, I'm just... glad you're
putting yourself out there,

12:23.377 --> 12:24.762
you know, having fun.

12:25.379 --> 12:27.354
Why is everybody so
obsessed with my fun levels?

12:27.384 --> 12:30.342
Because if something does
come out of that seal,

12:30.368 --> 12:31.912
I want you at Peak Wynonna:

12:32.124 --> 12:33.891
Whisky, soaked and reckless.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.534
He's here.

12:35.732 --> 12:37.035
On the homestead?

12:37.155 --> 12:39.484
At least we know he's not a Revenant.

12:52.461 --> 12:54.888
It's great to see so
many faces back in town

12:54.905 --> 12:58.026
for the first Annual
Purg High Homecoming game!

13:00.600 --> 13:02.027
You have my word,

13:02.070 --> 13:05.721
Purgatory: We. Will.
Turn. This. Town. Around!

13:08.386 --> 13:10.240
Where's Bryce? He said he'd be here.

13:10.278 --> 13:12.438
And I'm so frikkin' excited

13:12.460 --> 13:15.905
to be here with the '07 Champs
to announce that, this spring,

13:15.927 --> 13:20.232
ground will be broken on the
brand new Gardner Community Centre!

13:22.537 --> 13:26.202
Yes, my parents left most
of their fortune to the town.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.569
Wonderful, isn't it?

13:28.604 --> 13:30.596
Yes, it's great.

13:30.618 --> 13:32.510
I could just scream.

13:33.485 --> 13:35.903
Ahem! Yeah, so let's
hear it one more time

13:35.912 --> 13:38.655
for the Champs, and you get
in there and enjoy the game!

13:51.840 --> 13:53.504
- Hey, Per.
- Jesus!

13:53.668 --> 13:54.453
What?

13:55.260 --> 13:56.182
You Okay?

13:56.224 --> 13:58.079
Not bailing on me, are ya?

13:58.199 --> 13:59.786
Sorry. It's just...

14:00.135 --> 14:01.209
some date, right?

14:02.015 --> 14:04.236
Well, you gotta give the
people want they want.

14:04.482 --> 14:08.147
And what they want is to
celebrate Purgatory's big win.

14:08.846 --> 14:11.320
- Again and again.
- And again.

14:11.949 --> 14:13.868
It's all so... pathetic.

14:14.148 --> 14:17.425
- I didn't mean that.
- Celebrating something so pointless.

14:18.076 --> 14:20.626
We were teenagers. Playing a game.

14:20.628 --> 14:22.111
Ten freaking years ago.

14:22.986 --> 14:24.539
Yeah, well,

14:24.932 --> 14:27.647
this town has trouble
letting go of the past.

14:28.069 --> 14:31.014
I wish past me had paid a little
more attention to some things.

14:31.932 --> 14:33.221
Do you wanna get out of here?

14:33.256 --> 14:34.765
- Get something to eat?
- Hey now,

14:35.114 --> 14:37.830
we can do both. Perry,

14:38.421 --> 14:39.692
I need to talk to you about Bryce.

14:39.714 --> 14:41.684
What kind of detective are you, anyways?

14:42.162 --> 14:44.116
- Wait, what about Bryce?
- Perry?

14:44.236 --> 14:46.482
Oh! It's happening, man!

14:46.853 --> 14:48.624
- It's HAPPENING!
- Easy, Skip. What?

14:48.646 --> 14:49.621
Everything!

14:50.195 --> 14:51.298
B-Train...

14:51.418 --> 14:55.037
he's DEAD! Bryce's wife
called me, freaking out, man.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.793
- The cops found him yesterday!
- You're drunk and you're talking too much.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.888
- You said you'd FIX it!!
- He's out of his mind.

14:59.905 --> 15:01.302
- I'll take him home.
- Hold up.

15:02.073 --> 15:04.402
Bryce's nickname is B-Train?

15:05.687 --> 15:07.885
Hm, shady and suspicious,

15:07.902 --> 15:10.089
therefore gettin' more delicious.

15:12.064 --> 15:13.999
Calm down, Flaming Ladybug.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.628
- Waverly!
- Hey!

15:22.818 --> 15:25.310
- Ooh, where's Perry?
- Messed up,

15:25.326 --> 15:27.564
emotionally unavailable,
possibly-involved-in-a-murder Perry?

15:27.582 --> 15:29.151
Oh my god, you're gonna
ask him to marry you.

15:29.168 --> 15:31.924
Also I just found out his dead
friend's nickname was B-Train.

15:32.044 --> 15:34.532
I would've milked that
so hard in high school.

15:35.282 --> 15:38.029
- We need to get to Skip Morgan's house.
- Oh, I'm meeting Nicole.

15:38.581 --> 15:40.698
Well, waiting for her to get off work.

15:40.728 --> 15:42.246
You're gonna pass up a
chance to crack a case

15:42.259 --> 15:44.246
- to wait around for your girlfriend?
- So what?

15:44.307 --> 15:46.454
So I'm having flashbacks of you

15:46.471 --> 15:48.273
watching Champ play video games and

15:48.635 --> 15:50.243
missing your Valedictorian speech.

15:50.247 --> 15:52.326
He got to level 70 on one guy.

15:52.507 --> 15:54.853
- Waverly.
- Besides, this is different, Okay?

15:57.789 --> 15:59.286
You've come so far.

15:59.907 --> 16:02.688
Just don't let anyone make
you forget you're an Earp.

16:04.236 --> 16:06.323
Look, that can mean
whatever I want it to, Okay?

16:06.797 --> 16:08.143
Here, take the jeep.

16:08.263 --> 16:09.591
When you stop dating psychos,

16:09.604 --> 16:11.354
you can give me relationship advice.

16:11.363 --> 16:13.618
Hey, come on!

16:31.018 --> 16:34.485
- Boop!
- Waverly, um,

16:34.515 --> 16:37.692
as we speak, Shorty's crowd
is staggering over here

16:37.700 --> 16:40.059
for sports-yelling and down-falling.

16:40.287 --> 16:42.361
Look, baby, I'm off in a
couple hours. Can't you...

16:42.369 --> 16:43.598
entertain yourself?

16:50.437 --> 16:51.364
Wave!

16:51.373 --> 16:53.382
Not in uniform, Okay? Not in public.

16:53.404 --> 16:54.564
Not good enough.

17:01.679 --> 17:02.623
Hey!

17:04.421 --> 17:05.539
Give me your phone.

17:05.555 --> 17:06.887
You must be new.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.710
- If I find upskirts on there...
- You might.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.429
Also the video of you
and Waverly making out.

17:12.459 --> 17:14.059
I don't think that's allowed.

17:14.118 --> 17:16.550
- Okay...
- Let him go. It's not worth it.

17:16.573 --> 17:18.815
- Excuse me?
- It's Tucker. He's a Gardner.

17:18.827 --> 17:20.509
I don't care what he does.
Give me your damn phone.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.316
If that's broken, you'll pay for it.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.537
Okay, you know what?

17:25.925 --> 17:28.550
You're under arrest for
obstructing a peace officer.

17:28.853 --> 17:31.265
Ow! Ow, ow!

17:31.948 --> 17:35.195
- She's hurting me, Waverly!
- Nicole, you don't wanna do this...

17:35.203 --> 17:37.084
Don't tell me how to do my job.

17:41.814 --> 17:42.900
Perry?

17:44.159 --> 17:45.147
Skip?

17:45.923 --> 17:46.820
It's too late.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.998
- It got B-Train.
- B-Train.

17:56.279 --> 17:57.344
What's that?

17:59.121 --> 18:00.005
Perry put it there.

18:00.014 --> 18:01.471
He's out of his gourd.

18:02.592 --> 18:04.149
Perry marked you with blood?

18:04.640 --> 18:06.654
Ugh, he's so hot.

18:07.089 --> 18:09.770
Any chance he also crawled
out of an ancient broken seal?

18:09.890 --> 18:13.116
The time is
nigh. I will claim what is mine.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.872
- Holy farked up Wizard of Oz bullshit!
- No!

18:15.992 --> 18:17.182
Stop!

18:18.212 --> 18:20.691
Okay, good. Now roll over.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.601
Beg?

18:27.543 --> 18:28.896
Dude! What are you doing?

18:28.926 --> 18:31.914
It'll go through you
to get what it wants,

18:31.987 --> 18:33.531
and it wants my guts, man.

18:34.220 --> 18:36.510
- Run!
- Not big on cardio these days.

18:38.697 --> 18:39.822
Where'd you...

18:42.612 --> 18:43.776
Here, boy!

18:48.437 --> 18:50.580
Skip, you stupid drunken idiot!

18:52.054 --> 18:54.468
I'm just glad B-Train's
not alive to see this.

19:02.478 --> 19:03.724
Thank you.

19:07.682 --> 19:08.765
Who is that?

19:08.932 --> 19:11.916
That's one of Tucker's
older sisters. Beth Gardner.

19:12.036 --> 19:14.982
- You're letting her bail him out?
- There's no bail required.

19:15.017 --> 19:17.087
- He's not being charged.
- Wha...

19:17.207 --> 19:19.204
He was taking photos of teenage girls.

19:19.221 --> 19:20.713
His phone was practically
up their hoo-has.

19:20.738 --> 19:22.765
Oh! Language!

19:23.075 --> 19:25.084
Nicole, you're a Sheriff's Deputy.

19:25.675 --> 19:27.361
Not gonna win cop of the year, mind you,

19:27.369 --> 19:29.728
with that public
display of gal-pal-itis.

19:29.806 --> 19:32.022
I'm sorry about Waverly.
But those photos...

19:32.061 --> 19:33.897
Love the initiative,

19:34.721 --> 19:37.075
but the Gardners...

19:37.749 --> 19:40.197
Tucker's parents were good people.

19:40.516 --> 19:42.745
Important people, to this town.

19:43.206 --> 19:46.134
- Boys will be boys.
- Whoa. Sorry,

19:46.199 --> 19:49.329
did I hit my head and wake up
in patriarchal bullshit land?

19:49.449 --> 19:51.033
It looks fine to me.

19:51.115 --> 19:54.116
That reminds me, though... the
first aid kit needs restocking.

19:54.142 --> 19:55.875
I want her charged with harassment.

19:55.905 --> 19:58.126
Oh, you have not seen harassment.

19:58.509 --> 20:02.945
- Such a nasty woman.
- I know, baby. I know.

20:04.777 --> 20:06.096
Look, you cool your heels

20:06.109 --> 20:07.976
while you take a chunk out
of those reports in there.

20:07.997 --> 20:10.826
- You're putting me on paperwork?
- They're the Gardners.

20:12.231 --> 20:14.439
Nicole, keep your head in the game.

20:15.745 --> 20:18.759
You'll learn how this town works.
It only took me thirty years.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.294
It's probably out of water.

20:32.488 --> 20:35.709
One of the two ingredients
in coffee? That's a fail.

20:36.450 --> 20:38.753
I just came to get
some books for Waverly.

20:38.788 --> 20:42.983
So she wouldn't have to come
herself and risk running into me.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.757
Uh, I mean, she didn't...
she didn't say that, so...

20:49.026 --> 20:50.933
Anyway, gotta jet.

20:50.966 --> 20:53.100
Kinda dealing with a
demon scarecrow thing.

20:53.159 --> 20:54.447
Wynonna...

20:56.813 --> 20:58.893
Have you noticed any...

20:59.524 --> 21:02.173
like, changes in Waverly lately?

21:02.763 --> 21:05.026
- Are you hoping for some?
- No!

21:07.779 --> 21:10.950
It's just... ever since
Willa was... sent down,

21:11.009 --> 21:13.450
- she's been acting... not herself.
- Hmm.

21:13.849 --> 21:15.778
Well, one sister kills the other.

21:15.794 --> 21:18.463
- Might rattle your cage a bit.
- No, of course.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.028
It's just, what I really
love about Waverly is...

21:21.556 --> 21:24.952
it's like it's sometimes
missing, you know, a sweetness.

21:25.198 --> 21:27.075
And she's become hard.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.683
Cruel, almost. More...

21:29.715 --> 21:31.079
Like me?

21:32.568 --> 21:34.474
Is this because she kept
you out of Black Badge?

21:34.507 --> 21:35.676
You know what?

21:36.107 --> 21:37.341
Forget it.

21:37.374 --> 21:40.085
I think we both know I won't.

21:41.987 --> 21:43.523
Awesome day.

21:43.782 --> 21:45.410
Perfect.

21:50.967 --> 21:52.815
- What's this?
- What Perry...

21:52.831 --> 21:54.561
- Her date.
- It wasn't a date.

21:55.866 --> 21:58.625
What Perry scrawled
across Skip's front door

21:58.745 --> 22:02.527
- and his forehead - in blood,
just before Skip was attacked

22:02.544 --> 22:05.135
- by one ugly hockey fan.
- You think your date summoned this demon?

22:05.168 --> 22:07.846
A demon who makes people tear
out their own insides, yeah.

22:07.905 --> 22:09.544
He at least buy you dessert?

22:10.227 --> 22:12.302
- Guys.
- Did Perry break the seal?

22:12.313 --> 22:14.102
- No, that doesn't make sense.
- But if it's not connected,

22:14.145 --> 22:15.325
then what the hell are we doing?

22:15.331 --> 22:17.255
Bagging and tagging
low-level shit disturbers

22:17.271 --> 22:19.518
to get Lucado off BBD's naughty list?

22:19.638 --> 22:22.148
- Wynonna, it's Okay.
- No, it's not!

22:22.720 --> 22:26.012
I know something evil and
terrifying is coming, Okay?

22:26.055 --> 22:28.614
Even my hair is tingling.
And without Dolls...

22:32.949 --> 22:34.205
Cover me.

22:43.675 --> 22:46.132
- Perry?
- I heard everything.

22:46.741 --> 22:49.942
It's true, you are some
kind of paranormal warrior.

22:54.431 --> 22:57.471
Don't want him summoning
monsters on your front stoop.

22:58.447 --> 23:01.373
Okay, except...

23:02.160 --> 23:03.556
It's an Algiz.

23:04.941 --> 23:06.725
An ancient ruinic guardian symbol.

23:06.845 --> 23:09.576
He wasn't trying to summon
something to attack his friends.

23:09.586 --> 23:11.284
He was trying to protect them.

23:14.578 --> 23:15.990
I'll get my vapours.

23:24.101 --> 23:25.297
Gah!

23:26.181 --> 23:28.990
- What the goddamn hell!?
- Salts of hartshorn.

23:29.110 --> 23:30.590
Pardon the error in judgment.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.107
- Are you kidding me? Wynonna...
- Okay.

23:33.172 --> 23:35.564
A creature is making your
friends tear themselves apart,

23:35.591 --> 23:37.757
you're drawing protection
symbols to try to stop him,

23:37.779 --> 23:40.274
and unless you want us to
make your day truly chomp nard,

23:40.394 --> 23:41.859
you'd better start talking.

23:43.239 --> 23:45.096
You'd never believe it.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.906
Try me. I'm Wynonna
Earp, Demon Detective.

23:51.409 --> 23:54.309
The Blue Devils were a
joke. We'd had enough.

23:54.551 --> 23:57.548
Senior year, Old Coach
Moore, he gave us a...

23:57.668 --> 23:58.927
spell.

23:59.132 --> 24:01.438
He was batshit crazy
about losing all the time.

24:01.558 --> 24:03.810
So me, Skip, Cam and Bryce...

24:03.826 --> 24:05.777
- B-Train.
- Wynonna.

24:06.391 --> 24:08.984
We didn't take it seriously, but...

24:09.302 --> 24:11.803
we hit the bong and said the words.

24:12.198 --> 24:13.582
Then, I shit you not,

24:13.749 --> 24:16.250
this thing appeared
out of the trophy case.

24:17.948 --> 24:20.708
Freaky grain sack over its face.

24:21.069 --> 24:24.135
<i>It barely spoke, but we
just understood that</i>

24:24.168 --> 24:26.350
<i>we'd have ten amazing years.</i>

24:26.620 --> 24:28.630
Get whatever we wished for.

24:29.638 --> 24:31.304
We were seventeen,

24:31.676 --> 24:33.513
ten years sounded like forever.

24:33.633 --> 24:35.368
We didn't realize it'd kill us.

24:35.595 --> 24:38.881
And now Burlap Jack's back
for his pound of flesh.

24:39.001 --> 24:41.646
We all make deals we regret.

24:44.432 --> 24:46.777
- And the ten years?
- Skip married a cheerleader.

24:46.799 --> 24:49.336
Cam and Bryce... they did Okay.

24:49.385 --> 24:52.351
- And you?
- Check the Forbes list.

24:52.471 --> 24:54.019
- Whoa...
- Forbes?

24:55.997 --> 24:57.404
Why come back?

24:57.524 --> 24:58.892
If it doesn't get what it wants from us,

24:58.913 --> 25:00.416
it might target our families.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.957
Besides, isn't it better to face
our mistake where it all started

25:03.979 --> 25:06.086
- than pretend it didn't happen?
- Dude,

25:06.603 --> 25:08.591
I knew we had crazy in common.

25:09.389 --> 25:11.932
Coach died, so I did research.

25:11.964 --> 25:13.549
Black magic, Occult.

25:13.669 --> 25:15.634
But I'm no expert at breaking
a deal with the devil.

25:15.645 --> 25:17.639
Not a deal.

25:17.660 --> 25:20.102
You said a wish, right?

25:20.598 --> 25:21.783
Okay.

25:21.805 --> 25:24.123
Did the demon emerge from a vessel?

25:24.414 --> 25:27.173
- We were pretty high...
- The trophy.

25:27.238 --> 25:29.324
Yes! It could be a Marzaniok.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.556
- Bringer of good and bad fortune.
- Okay.

25:33.291 --> 25:34.973
We'll split up, find
the other two hockey bros

25:34.983 --> 25:36.050
and bring them in to BBD.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.313
Lure the Marzipan there and
I'll shoot it before anyone else

25:38.335 --> 25:40.176
can perform back-alley
surgery on themselves.

25:40.521 --> 25:42.306
Let's get this over with.

25:45.039 --> 25:47.143
Wynonna. Hold up.

25:47.842 --> 25:50.442
We just go round and
round, fighting demons.

25:50.498 --> 25:52.499
Can't waste any more time on this...

25:52.728 --> 25:55.901
- what's the Doc-ism? Fool's errand?
- No, just the opposite.

25:56.142 --> 25:57.957
This demon was brought
forth from a vessel.

25:57.983 --> 26:00.609
Should it return, it could
be contained, kept alive.

26:00.644 --> 26:02.977
Why, so it can con more
people into shitty deals?

26:02.990 --> 26:05.921
No, to save the person who got
the shittiest deal of them all.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.875
We catch this demon, Wynonna,

26:07.892 --> 26:11.634
and we use it to save
Deputy Marshall Dolls.

26:13.311 --> 26:16.260
Lions and tigers and bears, oh shit.

26:16.886 --> 26:18.676
You've been cooking drugs for Dolls?

26:18.723 --> 26:21.453
He can no longer depend on
Black Badge for his supply.

26:21.487 --> 26:23.401
That's why you bought
Shorty's? All for him?

26:23.414 --> 26:25.462
- Why didn't he ask...
- We are running out of time.

26:25.483 --> 26:28.742
Suffice to say, there is an effort
afoot to concoct what he needs,

26:28.768 --> 26:31.251
which requires a demon's
blood in its purest form.

26:31.286 --> 26:35.003
If we catch and contain this
Marzaniok, we can extract it.

26:37.133 --> 26:38.775
Then... let's get to
not killing a demon.

26:43.725 --> 26:46.428
- Word from your fellas?
- Skip's gone AWOL.

26:46.772 --> 26:47.962
But it's not like Cam.

26:48.018 --> 26:50.157
Some stones to turn over still.

26:50.356 --> 26:52.515
Keep yer pecker up. Hoo doggie.

26:54.235 --> 26:55.347
Sheriff.

26:56.369 --> 26:59.440
Might I inquire as to who's
enjoying his final rest?

27:00.419 --> 27:01.376
Sorry.

27:02.553 --> 27:03.463
It's Cam.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.550
He tore his own eyes out.

27:06.968 --> 27:10.542
Dug so deep he hit brain
matter, and then, well...

27:18.752 --> 27:20.403
There there, compadre.

27:20.921 --> 27:23.542
At this rate, you'll be broken
enough for her in no time.

27:23.662 --> 27:26.294
- You think that's funny?
- Not in the slightest.

27:27.251 --> 27:29.701
- Skip's the only one left.
- Fret not,

27:29.973 --> 27:31.943
an Earp is on the case.

27:32.012 --> 27:36.095
Don't you worry, Cheryl. I'll
have Skip out lickety split.

27:37.017 --> 27:37.893
Man.

27:38.577 --> 27:42.610
Only a deal with a demon could
land Skip a wife that stacked.

27:42.627 --> 27:45.022
- Hi, Waverly.
- Jesus! Tucker!

27:45.658 --> 27:48.073
- Whew! You startled me.
- I'm sorry.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.207
I'd never want to cause you distress.

27:50.228 --> 27:52.227
It's fine. I have to go, Okay?

27:52.265 --> 27:53.839
You look so pretty when you smile.

27:53.855 --> 27:55.952
- You should do it more often.
- Really, Tucker?

27:56.011 --> 27:57.758
Can I ask you something?

27:57.878 --> 28:00.630
Maybe you could get your cop friend
to treat me with more respect?

28:00.690 --> 28:02.749
Officer Haught is my girlfriend.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.266
You're confused.

28:05.649 --> 28:08.322
That's impossible. It'd just be wrong.

28:11.334 --> 28:13.129
I'll show you wrong.

28:32.688 --> 28:34.343
Hi, Doc! Great news:

28:34.463 --> 28:36.733
I know where Skip is!

28:45.844 --> 28:46.949
Hey, team.

28:47.622 --> 28:50.236
Everything on fleek? Fleek city?

28:50.549 --> 28:53.152
Super fleek? Oh my god, Earp.

28:53.206 --> 28:57.020
Uh, look, we need this so the luck
of the 07's will rub off on us?

28:57.022 --> 28:59.438
And you're kinda harshing our buzz here,

28:59.558 --> 29:01.103
lunch lady.

29:02.412 --> 29:04.644
Yeah, I'll serve your
lunch. Hand it over.

29:04.708 --> 29:08.352
- Back off, Mom.
- Mom? Okay, Okay.

29:08.472 --> 29:11.020
Now I'm terrified for you.

29:13.770 --> 29:16.740
Look, Charlie here spent 300
minutes in the penalty box this year.

29:16.860 --> 29:19.952
Yeah? You had me at 'box'.

29:23.315 --> 29:26.285
What a crazy awesome bitch.

29:27.707 --> 29:30.526
♪ You better run
as fast as you can ♪

29:30.828 --> 29:34.185
♪ Away from everything 'cause
I've got something planned ♪

29:34.226 --> 29:38.130
♪ We're coming for you, you can't
escape anything that we try ♪

29:38.168 --> 29:40.022
♪ 'Cause we'll be right behind ya ♪

29:40.076 --> 29:42.114
♪ You better run, you better hide ♪

29:42.162 --> 29:47.945
♪ Nah nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah we're coming for you ♪

29:52.450 --> 29:55.307
You look like you had some fun.

29:55.347 --> 29:58.863
Kicked some ass, did my part. You?

29:58.917 --> 30:02.501
Caught up with Cam a mite
late, but located Skip.

30:03.158 --> 30:06.471
- Is he safe?
- It ain't him we're worried about.

30:08.321 --> 30:10.822
- I have to get out of here!
- You stole a vehicle

30:10.833 --> 30:14.416
and ruined a perfectly good
oak while under the influence.

30:14.433 --> 30:16.275
That tree came right at me!

30:16.395 --> 30:19.870
- Sure, Skip, Okay.
- Officer, please. It'll hurt my wife.

30:20.479 --> 30:22.241
- Anyone near me.
- Look, dude,

30:22.252 --> 30:25.129
the straw man argument is really
not gonna work with me, so...

30:28.055 --> 30:29.290
I'm sorry.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.808
Skip, are you gonna puke?

30:41.063 --> 30:44.198
Skip?

30:44.495 --> 30:47.194
I come for what's mine.

30:47.314 --> 30:50.722
- Hands on your head! NOW.
- Move. Or die.

30:51.024 --> 30:53.326
I am a Purgatory Sheriff's Deputy,

30:53.343 --> 30:55.555
and if you think you can
come in here, in my office,

30:55.576 --> 30:56.973
and mess with one of my citizens,

30:56.982 --> 30:59.353
you are underestimating
the day I've had!

31:10.392 --> 31:12.604
We did not cover this at the Academy.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.153
Are we too late?

31:35.339 --> 31:36.296
You okay?

31:36.313 --> 31:40.232
- I had him right where I wanted.
- Where is he?

31:40.262 --> 31:41.408
Holed up.

31:42.016 --> 31:43.120
Hey, Perry!

31:43.146 --> 31:45.775
No! You sure can pick 'em.

32:00.464 --> 32:02.788
This has to end.

32:03.030 --> 32:05.746
Please. We didn't know
what we were doing.

32:05.811 --> 32:07.600
Perry! Open the door!

32:07.622 --> 32:10.735
- Let me in, dum-dum! Where are the keys?
- I'VE GOT THIS!

32:18.874 --> 32:20.546
- What are you doing?
- A spell.

32:20.666 --> 32:23.105
In Old High German. I think.

32:23.225 --> 32:25.002
Where's Waverly when you need her?

32:25.019 --> 32:28.240
I thought she was with you.

32:32.126 --> 32:33.462
Gah!

32:34.281 --> 32:37.687
Hey! No! Mm-mm! Uh...

32:38.451 --> 32:40.137
There's no place like home.

32:40.159 --> 32:43.346
- I shall have my pound of flesh.
- Ah!

32:45.579 --> 32:47.929
- Deal's off, homie.
- Wynonna...

32:49.428 --> 32:50.508
Spare me

32:50.581 --> 32:54.276
and I shall grant you what
you most desire. Anything.

32:57.273 --> 32:58.830
Doc, there are other demons.

32:58.950 --> 33:00.929
Ours is dang near out of time.

33:06.137 --> 33:07.750
You know what I wish?

33:09.509 --> 33:12.035
I wish you'd get back
in the goddamned trophy.

33:28.445 --> 33:30.057
That was brave,

33:30.321 --> 33:32.313
trying to reverse the spell.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.119
Also stupid.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.606
Brave but stupid.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.037
I'll take it.

33:37.912 --> 33:39.050
And alive.

33:39.611 --> 33:40.848
Don't forget that.

33:41.964 --> 33:43.335
It's not fair.

33:44.012 --> 33:45.482
My teammates are dead.

33:46.254 --> 33:48.806
We made mistakes, but we
were all in it together.

33:48.845 --> 33:50.121
You saved one.

33:50.811 --> 33:51.755
Skip.

33:52.467 --> 33:54.157
Tried to save the others.

33:54.778 --> 33:56.537
Sometimes that's all we can do, right?

34:08.089 --> 34:09.489
I guess your friend's right.

34:10.288 --> 34:11.788
I'm not broken enough for you.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.018
No, I'm the one who's broken.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.916
Now go have a life.

34:39.675 --> 34:41.857
Looks like you had a little
trouble with the paperwork.

34:42.116 --> 34:45.056
Look, I'll clean up the
mess and file the report.

34:46.324 --> 34:49.074
You wanna know how
Purgatory really works?

34:55.429 --> 34:56.572
Okay.

35:02.092 --> 35:06.029
Everyone pretends the whole goddamn
town isn't overrun by demons.

35:07.033 --> 35:08.409
That's it?

35:08.734 --> 35:10.591
That's the big secret?

35:10.621 --> 35:13.626
The people who choose to live
here, they want a simple life

35:13.979 --> 35:16.299
in a small town with
a shitty hockey team

35:16.368 --> 35:17.653
and a view of the Rockies.

35:17.692 --> 35:19.443
Some of us feel that that's worth

35:19.464 --> 35:22.069
ignoring the occasional
mermaid poltergeist.

35:22.189 --> 35:25.700
Okay, yeah, now I'm sure I've hit my head.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.933
I sure hope not.

35:26.993 --> 35:29.578
You graduated top of
your class in the big city

35:29.579 --> 35:32.538
and I need someone smart
to take over when I retire.

35:34.457 --> 35:36.411
You want me to be Sheriff?

35:36.896 --> 35:39.727
Why do you think I worked
so hard to recruit you?

35:40.199 --> 35:42.292
Look, I know that Black Badge

35:42.314 --> 35:44.349
seems like a hot shit
covert operation...

35:44.362 --> 35:45.767
And they don't have to wear khakis.

35:45.887 --> 35:47.957
But who's gonna keep
the drunks off the road?

35:48.621 --> 35:50.992
Who'll referee the neighbourhood feuds?

35:52.048 --> 35:53.565
Who will keep the ordinary,

35:53.608 --> 35:58.161
everyday, non-werewolf citizens
of Purgatory safe, Officer Haught?

35:59.795 --> 36:01.964
We need more manpower, Okay?

36:02.012 --> 36:04.801
And we've gotta work with
BBD and stop pretending

36:04.835 --> 36:06.853
there's nothing paranormal
going on around here.

36:07.448 --> 36:08.534
Okay.

36:08.802 --> 36:11.996
You got permission to intervene in
the wacky stuff when it's necessary.

36:12.039 --> 36:14.256
The Lord knows they
could use your instincts.

36:14.752 --> 36:15.873
And the khakis?

36:15.929 --> 36:17.593
They're a classic trouser.

36:18.788 --> 36:19.728
Fine.

36:19.905 --> 36:21.590
Fine. Just be a good cop.

36:23.229 --> 36:24.410
It matters.

36:25.272 --> 36:26.380
Yeah.

36:26.993 --> 36:28.239
Yes, it does.

36:29.123 --> 36:30.257
And Nicole...

36:34.630 --> 36:36.414
It's called a long game.

36:38.915 --> 36:41.066
I've been playing one for a while.

36:50.471 --> 36:52.006
<i>She attacked me, Beth.</i>

36:52.079 --> 36:54.601
By the throat, like she
had superhuman strength!

36:54.636 --> 36:58.172
Waverly Earp? She's a hundred
pounds with both goody two shoes on.

36:58.228 --> 36:59.561
I want to report her at the same time

36:59.578 --> 37:01.233
we sue Officer Haught for assault.

37:01.259 --> 37:02.910
We have to stick up for each other.

37:02.919 --> 37:04.872
- We're Gardners.
- You're a directionless shut-in

37:04.881 --> 37:06.636
and our brother is the town pervert.

37:06.675 --> 37:09.369
- Mercedes!
- And as of now, that is going to stop.

37:09.386 --> 37:10.964
What, like you're in charge?

37:11.576 --> 37:13.391
You know, today I
watched the same people

37:13.421 --> 37:16.914
who've been making my friend
Wynonna Earp's life miserable forever

37:16.944 --> 37:19.234
finally get their asses kicked by her,

37:19.509 --> 37:21.169
and it was glorious.

37:21.187 --> 37:23.093
- If Mom and Dad were here...
- Well, they're not.

37:23.636 --> 37:26.455
We'll not be suing
Officer Haught, or Waverly.

37:26.507 --> 37:29.128
Leave them alone, Tucker. I mean it.

37:29.189 --> 37:32.000
I'm not fighting your battles
any more. And neither is Beth.

37:39.385 --> 37:40.882
If you die,

37:41.511 --> 37:43.918
I don't have to wait until I turn 21

37:43.961 --> 37:45.586
- to get my money.
- Super.

37:45.647 --> 37:47.310
Until then, you're cut off.

37:47.914 --> 37:49.419
- You can't!
- Watch me.

37:50.772 --> 37:52.320
I hate you, Mercedes.

37:52.440 --> 37:53.850
I hate you.

38:07.466 --> 38:08.566
Yep.

38:09.036 --> 38:10.735
It's time we pulled a Wynonna.

38:10.855 --> 38:12.050
Did an about-face.

38:33.898 --> 38:35.558
So the genie's back in the bottle?

38:35.584 --> 38:38.266
Sack-face won't be rigging
any more scrimmages.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.456
But we need to know how to take him out.

38:40.702 --> 38:42.414
Control him. Draw his blood.

38:42.457 --> 38:44.777
Translating the incantation as we speak.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.532
Hey, Nicole was brave.

38:48.800 --> 38:51.314
She took a beating
trying to protect Skip.

38:52.478 --> 38:54.552
- You guys Okay?
- Of course.

38:54.672 --> 38:57.099
- She's my best baby.
- Blech.

38:58.445 --> 38:59.664
But also,

39:00.173 --> 39:01.432
you're the best,

39:01.786 --> 39:05.473
Okay? The bestest. I just
want her to remember that.

39:05.593 --> 39:08.478
How about I remind her, huh? Tonight.

39:08.707 --> 39:11.466
Might help if you returned
my lipstick, though.

39:11.586 --> 39:12.505
I did.

39:13.161 --> 39:15.519
- Really?
- I gave it to you.

39:15.946 --> 39:16.796
Huh.

39:17.752 --> 39:19.611
- I'll check again.
- 'K.

39:25.759 --> 39:27.221
You sure you're Okay?

39:29.156 --> 39:30.954
Better put that somewhere safe.

39:31.985 --> 39:33.648
Okay, see you at home.

39:49.364 --> 39:51.606
Where is it? Clock's ticking.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.843
I require assurances from you.

39:54.123 --> 39:55.693
Like I have a choice?

39:57.306 --> 39:59.711
Once released, ensure
the creature is restrained

39:59.719 --> 40:01.819
before you try and harvest what we need.

40:01.939 --> 40:03.932
Do not look it in the
eye, do not make any wish

40:03.949 --> 40:06.846
and do not seek to use
it to your advantage.

40:07.432 --> 40:09.761
- You think I'm stupid?
- Problem is,

40:10.489 --> 40:12.058
I know that you're not.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.061
Holy Heisenberg,

40:25.686 --> 40:26.933
what is all this?

40:28.062 --> 40:31.072
Before Dolls' escape, I injected
him with the last of his serum,

40:31.140 --> 40:34.115
save for one iota. My bartender
here has been undertaking

40:34.124 --> 40:37.620
the challenging task of trying
to reverse engineer the formula.

40:37.672 --> 40:39.992
We think Boobs McSeltzer
can pull this off?

40:40.031 --> 40:41.371
Her name is Rosita

40:41.553 --> 40:43.678
and she has an advanced
degree in Biochemistry.

40:45.011 --> 40:46.313
Oh.

40:47.348 --> 40:49.532
Well, maybe then I'll just shut up

40:49.534 --> 40:51.354
and stop being such a superficial ass.

40:51.414 --> 40:53.652
Why didn't you tell
me any of this before?

40:55.207 --> 40:57.207
Dolls made you promise not to.

40:57.614 --> 40:59.869
Am I so garbage at life
he couldn't even trust me?

40:59.908 --> 41:01.468
It is a dangerous undertaking.

41:01.477 --> 41:03.926
Should Lucado ascertain
what we are doing here,

41:06.155 --> 41:08.630
I'm the one Dolls can afford to lose.

41:09.020 --> 41:10.278
But you still did it.

41:10.329 --> 41:12.067
I ain't doing it for him.

41:18.996 --> 41:20.535
You know, for a minute there,

41:20.552 --> 41:23.212
I feared you might make
a wish with the Marzaniok.

41:24.468 --> 41:26.654
You could have wished away the curse.

41:28.017 --> 41:30.940
I'm stubborn. I always
take the hard way.

41:31.449 --> 41:33.773
Whereas I took the path too easy.

41:35.045 --> 41:36.666
I am living...

41:37.671 --> 41:40.636
and living, and living...

41:40.908 --> 41:42.999
proof that it is not always prudent

41:43.012 --> 41:45.625
- to strike deals with demons.
- Doc, we have.

41:46.577 --> 41:47.785
In blood.

41:48.371 --> 41:49.656
Black Badge owns us,

41:49.695 --> 41:51.959
and if they find Dolls,
they'll shoot him on sight.

41:51.989 --> 41:54.684
Wynonna, I was supposed to make the
drop two days ago. It ain't ready.

41:54.709 --> 41:55.839
But it's still possible.

41:55.844 --> 41:58.491
- If we make it and Dolls can get here...
- No.

41:58.556 --> 41:59.919
We need to get it to him.

41:59.996 --> 42:02.191
He ain't coming back here. Ever.

42:02.350 --> 42:04.312
He's a damned fool if he does.

42:08.615 --> 42:10.780
Wave... Wave...

42:14.142 --> 42:15.539
What are you doing?

42:19.441 --> 42:20.665
Wave...

42:31.667 --> 42:34.448
Wave... Waverly!
