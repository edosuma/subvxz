00:50.490 --> 00:52.969
Callie and Decca
were two sisters.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.490
They were on a boat.

00:54.530 --> 00:57.490
They're in the water,
and Callie said to Decca,

00:57.530 --> 00:59.009
"Decca, will you tell me
the story

00:59.049 --> 01:01.689
about the upside-down tree
again please?"

01:01.689 --> 01:04.489
And Decca said,
"Once upon a time,

01:04.530 --> 01:06.810
"there was an upside-down tree.

01:06.810 --> 01:10.650
"And anyone who walked in
through the door of its trunk

01:10.650 --> 01:13.730
"would be immediately
turned to good

01:13.769 --> 01:15.329
if they were bad."

01:15.370 --> 01:17.730
Callie said,
"I would really like

01:17.769 --> 01:19.650
to see that tree sometime."

01:19.689 --> 01:21.530
They went on and on
in the water.

01:21.569 --> 01:23.609
Can you make water?

01:23.609 --> 01:25.849
Yeah.

01:25.849 --> 01:27.890
And then all of a sudden,
they hit land...

01:27.930 --> 01:29.609
And all the animals
joined them,

01:29.650 --> 01:32.409
'cause they wanted to see
the upside-down tree, too.

01:32.450 --> 01:34.490
They had a bunny rabbit.

01:34.530 --> 01:36.370
Can you make a bunny rabbit?

01:36.409 --> 01:40.250
Yeah, the bunny rabbits went,
and there were...

01:40.289 --> 01:42.009
wolves.

01:42.009 --> 01:44.569
And there was a cheetah.

01:44.569 --> 01:46.650
And... No, don't eat my nose.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.250
I'm trying to tell a story.

01:48.289 --> 01:49.530
Are you a monster?

01:49.530 --> 01:51.450
Are you a monster
eating my nose?

01:51.450 --> 01:53.009
I'm so scared of monsters.

01:53.049 --> 01:54.969
"I wish I could find
the upside-down tree,"

01:55.009 --> 01:57.170
and they ran and they found
the upside-down tree,

01:57.210 --> 01:58.890
but outside was a lion.

02:01.170 --> 02:02.450
"Get away from my tree.

02:02.489 --> 02:04.450
This is my tree."

02:04.489 --> 02:05.930
And Callie said,

02:05.969 --> 02:09.210
"Well, if it's your tree, Lion,
why don't you go inside it?"

02:09.250 --> 02:11.930
Lion said,
"All right, I will."

02:11.930 --> 02:14.969
And he went inside his tree.

02:16.289 --> 02:19.170
And his claws went back
in his paws.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.409
He started smiling.

02:21.449 --> 02:23.129
He started relaxing.

02:23.129 --> 02:25.449
He said, "You're my friends,

02:25.490 --> 02:28.129
and all my friends
are welcome here."

02:28.170 --> 02:31.250
And so Callie and Decca
went into the upside-down tree,

02:31.289 --> 02:33.770
and they all lived
happily ever after.

02:33.810 --> 02:38.170
Do good people ever turn bad
in the upside-down tree?

02:39.810 --> 02:41.090
No.

02:41.129 --> 02:43.530
Good people never turn bad.

02:47.810 --> 02:49.729
Sweet dreams, baby.

03:21.770 --> 03:23.490
Daddy! Daddy!

03:48.170 --> 03:49.129
Ham!

04:19.769 --> 04:21.370
Gunpowder.

04:21.410 --> 04:22.850
Okay.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.009
Ready?

04:24.009 --> 04:26.370
I'm ready.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.329
And...

04:29.370 --> 04:30.569
now.

04:32.649 --> 04:34.810
Son of a...!

04:34.850 --> 04:36.970
Watch your language.

04:48.290 --> 04:51.050
Last one.

04:58.850 --> 05:01.490
This one's not coming out.

05:03.449 --> 05:04.850
Jane.

05:06.850 --> 05:08.290
Jane.

05:08.329 --> 05:11.129
What?

05:11.170 --> 05:14.490
The Bishop boys.

05:16.089 --> 05:17.970
They're coming.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.850
They're coming?

05:21.889 --> 05:23.730
I'm sorry.

05:23.769 --> 05:25.209
I'm so sorry.

05:40.810 --> 05:43.090
If them bullets don't kill you,

05:43.129 --> 05:46.689
and this storm you somehow
brought upon us don't kill you,

05:46.730 --> 05:48.050
goes without saying...

05:49.449 --> 05:50.850
I will kill you.

05:56.129 --> 05:57.409
But I reckon,

05:57.449 --> 06:00.290
you might just be immortal.

06:19.410 --> 06:22.170
Don't go jumping up the second
I leave, starting gunfights.

06:22.209 --> 06:24.370
No.

06:31.569 --> 06:34.050
I can't feel my legs.

06:40.090 --> 06:41.090
You...

06:42.810 --> 06:44.850
You get going.

06:44.889 --> 06:47.569
Get Katie safe with you.

06:48.889 --> 06:51.209
I'm not gonna have you
lose another child.

06:54.529 --> 06:55.569
Jane?

07:00.970 --> 07:03.490
You don't have to come back.

07:06.490 --> 07:08.569
I understand.

07:10.449 --> 07:12.329
You know me better than that.

07:24.050 --> 07:26.529
Mommy, when are we coming back?

07:26.569 --> 07:28.490
Real soon, sweetheart.

07:28.529 --> 07:31.170
Coming back real soon.

08:09.569 --> 08:11.769
Remember where you came from.

08:13.529 --> 08:14.970
What was there?

08:14.970 --> 08:16.089
A cord.

08:16.089 --> 08:17.370
Right.

08:17.370 --> 08:21.170
And wherever you are,
I feel you.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.250
-Okay?
-Okay.

08:23.290 --> 08:25.689
Okay.

10:04.970 --> 10:07.929
Didn't I make it clear
last time?

10:12.769 --> 10:14.690
You ain't welcome here, Jane.

10:59.009 --> 11:00.210
Get out.

11:11.490 --> 11:14.009
Bishop boys are coming for us.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.049
I need help.

11:16.090 --> 11:18.649
You roll over
in that bed of yours, Jane,

11:18.690 --> 11:21.610
I think you'll find someone
who can help you.

11:21.649 --> 11:23.370
He can't help.

11:23.370 --> 11:25.610
-That's why I came.
-That's funny, isn't it?

11:25.649 --> 11:28.529
Isn't that also the reason
why you left?

11:28.570 --> 11:30.289
There is so much
you don't know, Dan.

11:30.330 --> 11:31.929
What I know...

11:33.649 --> 11:36.649
is I seen everything I need
to know with my own two eyes.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.730
So whatever
you gotta say to me,

11:38.730 --> 11:41.250
I figure you go back
to that little house of yours

11:41.289 --> 11:42.769
and best tell it
to your husband.

11:42.809 --> 11:45.210
'Cause me, I'm busy.

11:47.049 --> 11:48.809
And I don't got time
to entertain

11:48.809 --> 11:52.370
every girl I laid with
back in Missouri.

12:01.009 --> 12:02.649
Dan!

12:02.690 --> 12:06.529
If my husband could help,
I wouldn't have come here.

12:06.570 --> 12:07.889
He's in rough shape.

12:07.889 --> 12:10.330
Well, that's too bad.
What did he do?

12:10.370 --> 12:12.529
Bishop boys have been
hunting us down for years.

12:12.570 --> 12:15.649
They finally found Ham, and
they shot him to hell and back.

12:16.649 --> 12:18.649
Well, I ain't no doctor.

12:18.690 --> 12:20.730
I don't need a doctor.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.529
I need a gunslinger.

12:24.570 --> 12:27.490
Them Bishop boys
are coming for you...

12:29.169 --> 12:31.049
you don't need a gunslinger.

12:31.090 --> 12:32.929
You need a goddamn regiment.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.889
If I were you...

12:37.330 --> 12:39.009
I would just go home,

12:39.049 --> 12:42.409
and I would toss that big
sack of shit on a wagon

12:42.450 --> 12:45.570
and I would ride him
into town yourself,

12:45.610 --> 12:47.330
so they can hang him quick.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.129
Bishops would be sated,

12:51.169 --> 12:53.450
and you'll still have
your life.

12:55.049 --> 12:57.610
Maybe even a little bag of gold
for your troubles.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.169
Anything else
you choose to do...

13:03.250 --> 13:05.370
is pure ignorance.

13:09.730 --> 13:11.409
I thank you
for your hospitality.

13:11.409 --> 13:13.570
You're welcome. -And judging
by the looks of things,

13:13.610 --> 13:16.370
you wouldn't have been
much use to me anyway.

13:16.370 --> 13:17.450
Probably not.

13:17.490 --> 13:19.289
I'll hire me
somebody in Lullaby.

13:23.610 --> 13:24.370
He's not worth your life, Jane.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.769
My life's worth
isn't your concern.

13:26.809 --> 13:28.730
Hasn't been for years.

13:41.970 --> 13:44.169
I understand
that you were engaged

13:44.210 --> 13:46.649
in the trading of fur
with my old...

13:46.649 --> 13:47.970
friend, Bill Hammond.

13:48.009 --> 13:50.370
Somehow he managed
to execute four of my men

13:50.409 --> 13:51.809
and then ride off,
despite the fact

13:51.850 --> 13:53.970
that he was peppered
with bullet wounds.

13:54.009 --> 13:56.409
Now, how would
he have done that?

13:56.450 --> 13:58.809
I-I seen it through
the window, Mr. Bishop.

14:00.129 --> 14:02.490
H-Hammond walked to his horse.

14:02.490 --> 14:05.090
A bunch of guys
came around the corner.

14:05.129 --> 14:07.210
All hell broke loose.

14:10.169 --> 14:12.570
Ham-Hammond got
the best of them.

14:12.570 --> 14:15.169
You ever see him
in the company of a woman,

14:15.210 --> 14:17.450
significantly more attractive
than he is?

14:17.490 --> 14:19.690
Goes by the name
of Jane Ballard.

14:20.929 --> 14:23.370
Would you happen to know
where Hammond resides, then?

14:24.450 --> 14:25.529
You're a fur trader!

14:25.570 --> 14:26.850
Here I am trying
to trade with you,

14:26.889 --> 14:29.210
and you've nothing to offer!

14:30.649 --> 14:32.889
Don't know where he lives.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.450
But I see him...

14:37.490 --> 14:39.529
always heading north.

14:51.450 --> 14:53.529
P-Please.

14:53.570 --> 14:55.049
Please.

14:55.090 --> 14:58.289
I... I have a family.

15:23.730 --> 15:25.450
How long you been there for?

15:49.250 --> 15:51.330
Got enough firepower here

15:51.370 --> 15:52.690
to start another war.

15:52.730 --> 15:55.370
What you want
all this stuff for, anyways?

15:57.210 --> 15:58.690
Just do.

16:29.570 --> 16:30.809
Yeah!

16:37.210 --> 16:38.970
Well, mama said
we can bring 'em with us

16:39.009 --> 16:40.610
if we pack 'em up.

16:46.370 --> 16:47.769
Excuse me.

16:47.809 --> 16:50.330
Do you know where I could find
John Bishop?

16:52.450 --> 16:55.169
Well, Mr. Bishop's
a very busy man.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.570
Vic could help you.

16:57.570 --> 16:58.970
He's his right hand.

16:59.009 --> 17:00.649
Sometimes his left.

17:01.929 --> 17:04.170
He's right back there.

17:04.210 --> 17:05.569
All right.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.329
Thank you very much.

17:07.368 --> 17:08.769
Pleasure.

17:08.809 --> 17:10.250
Come on, Mary.

17:10.289 --> 17:12.210
Bye.

17:32.329 --> 17:33.809
You Vic?

17:33.849 --> 17:35.210
What'd you want?

17:35.210 --> 17:36.970
I want to join the trek.

17:36.970 --> 17:38.650
Well, that wagon's full.

17:40.730 --> 17:42.970
What? You don't hear good?

17:52.410 --> 17:54.450
Something I can help you with?

17:55.930 --> 17:59.210
I'm hoping to ride west
with John Bishop's party.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.970
Fella outside said
there's no room.

18:02.009 --> 18:03.769
That's my brother, Vic.

18:03.809 --> 18:06.930
He's an unyielding sort.

18:06.970 --> 18:08.569
What's your name?

18:08.609 --> 18:11.210
Jane Ballard.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.490
Tell me something, Jane.

18:12.529 --> 18:13.730
How many's in your party?

18:13.769 --> 18:15.849
Just me and my little girl.

18:15.849 --> 18:16.930
Husband?

18:16.970 --> 18:18.089
Had a fiance.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.490
He's dead.

18:19.529 --> 18:22.650
Died in the war.

18:22.690 --> 18:24.490
You're only
a slight thing, Jane.

18:24.490 --> 18:27.289
I think we can accommodate
your request.

18:27.329 --> 18:29.890
We're assured protection?

18:29.930 --> 18:33.529
Passage and protection,
most assuredly.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.730
Thank you.

19:16.369 --> 19:18.089
Seem to recall you putting up

19:18.130 --> 19:20.329
more of a fight
last time, Jane.

19:24.170 --> 19:27.130
The years do take it
out of a person, I guess.

19:27.170 --> 19:29.289
How about you scoot
on back there?

19:31.250 --> 19:32.569
Yeah.

19:32.609 --> 19:36.690
Yeah. Get us a little privacy.

19:36.690 --> 19:40.369
Now, let's you and me talk
about a certain...

19:40.369 --> 19:44.049
fur trading son of a bitch
named Bill Hammond.

19:44.049 --> 19:46.930
I haven't seen Bill Hammond
in years.

19:46.970 --> 19:48.930
-That right?
-That's right.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.529
Is that a Walker
you got there, Jane?

19:54.049 --> 19:56.210
You know,
that's a very particular

19:56.250 --> 19:59.089
model of firearm you got.

19:59.130 --> 20:00.529
Yeah.

20:00.529 --> 20:02.130
Believe I've seen that very one

20:02.130 --> 20:04.569
right up close in the hand
of Bill Hammond.

20:08.210 --> 20:11.130
You remember when he shot me,
don't you, Jane?

20:13.130 --> 20:14.930
Want to touch it?

20:20.170 --> 20:21.690
Let me get this straight.

20:21.730 --> 20:23.450
Hammond shoots four of my boys

20:23.490 --> 20:25.809
with a Walker that looks
just like that one there.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.690
Then, a couple days later,
his prize whore

20:28.730 --> 20:31.089
shows up right here in Lullaby.

20:31.130 --> 20:34.250
I haven't seen Hammond
in years!

20:37.930 --> 20:40.609
You know, Jane,
I could believe you.

20:40.650 --> 20:42.769
I really could.

20:44.569 --> 20:46.690
But I like to be sure.

20:47.609 --> 20:49.170
So now you're gonna stand up

20:49.210 --> 20:51.210
and take me to your house.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.849
If he ain't there,
I'll give you my word,

20:53.890 --> 20:56.369
I probably ain't
gonna kill you.

20:58.130 --> 21:02.049
But I sure as hell gonna...

21:08.089 --> 21:10.769
The hell are you?

21:10.809 --> 21:12.769
You okay, Jane?

21:17.210 --> 21:18.809
What's your stake
in this, cowboy?

21:18.849 --> 21:20.250
Well, I'm not sure yet.

21:20.289 --> 21:23.930
Why don't you holster
those Colts...

21:23.970 --> 21:26.089
let that lady be,
and we can talk.

21:26.130 --> 21:29.690
How about
you lower that rifle...

21:29.690 --> 21:31.289
and I make it worth your while.

21:31.329 --> 21:33.890
Really? How so?

21:33.930 --> 21:36.170
Split a bounty with you?

21:36.210 --> 21:38.250
Fixin' to get Bill Hammond.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.210
Well, how much?

21:42.210 --> 21:43.490
Enough.

21:43.529 --> 21:45.650
D-Dan.

21:45.690 --> 21:47.809
Shut up, Jane.

21:55.210 --> 21:58.690
You help us out, we cut you in.

22:03.529 --> 22:06.369
Maybe I even share
this one with you.

22:08.049 --> 22:10.529
Course, I get to go first.

22:10.569 --> 22:12.289
Me and Jane got some...

22:35.529 --> 22:37.569
We gotta get out of here.

23:34.970 --> 23:37.130
Give me a minute.

24:10.250 --> 24:11.250
Katie?

24:11.289 --> 24:13.970
She's fine.
How are you feeling?

24:19.809 --> 24:23.049
Turn me over. Turn me over.

24:31.329 --> 24:32.809
I'm here.

24:32.809 --> 24:34.329
Okay?

24:35.369 --> 24:37.210
Sorry I was gone so long.

24:43.930 --> 24:45.769
I brought help.

24:47.049 --> 24:49.809
Lie down. Relax.

25:21.609 --> 25:24.450
That all seems so far away.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.049
They already got plenty of men.

25:26.089 --> 25:27.650
I gotta go, Jane.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.730
No, you want to go.

25:32.849 --> 25:35.170
You know, the war
isn't gonna last very long.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.490
They say I'll be back
in a couple of months.

25:42.130 --> 25:44.369
Jane, really.

25:44.369 --> 25:46.410
I will be back...

25:46.450 --> 25:49.730
in a couple of months,
and we'll go wherever you want.

25:52.809 --> 25:55.609
Well, I want to go see
the Pacific.

25:55.650 --> 25:59.369
I want to step my feet
where there's no further to go.

26:01.490 --> 26:04.089
Well, that is
what we're gonna do.

26:21.450 --> 26:23.329
I love you.

26:23.369 --> 26:25.410
Then stay.

26:57.849 --> 27:00.130
We best get moving.

27:06.970 --> 27:08.890
Boys, we got another one dead.

27:08.890 --> 27:12.490
Found Fitchum
all shot up in an alley.

27:12.529 --> 27:16.289
Half his head on one side,
half his head on another.

27:16.329 --> 27:18.009
A man and woman
seen leaving Lullaby

27:18.009 --> 27:19.369
before the blood dried.

27:19.410 --> 27:21.089
And the girl
fit the description

27:21.130 --> 27:23.210
of our old friend Jane.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.410
Now, Fitchum's demise
brings Hammond's tally

27:25.450 --> 27:26.809
to five dead men,

27:26.809 --> 27:28.890
disregarding his heroics
at the whorehouse

27:28.930 --> 27:30.170
we all remember.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.529
Now, we'll spread out
across this valley here.

27:33.529 --> 27:35.450
Question every living soul.

27:35.450 --> 27:38.289
We will turn over every rock

27:38.329 --> 27:40.890
until that snake
slithers out into sight.

28:04.609 --> 28:06.490
Well...

28:06.490 --> 28:09.529
let's hope the Bishop boys
are all very big and fat.

28:23.849 --> 28:26.529
Ham taught me how to hunt.

28:26.569 --> 28:29.569
Rabbit stew doesn't taste
very good without rabbits.

28:43.650 --> 28:45.250
Is that a way in?

28:45.250 --> 28:47.650
There's only one way in,
one way out.

28:47.650 --> 28:49.730
That's why we chose
to build here.

28:51.650 --> 28:53.450
What about the ridge?

28:55.170 --> 28:58.650
You can maybe get up there.

28:58.690 --> 29:01.009
Good luck getting down.

29:01.049 --> 29:04.609
Okay, so he says,
"They're coming."

29:04.650 --> 29:07.049
Well, how many might "they" be?

29:07.089 --> 29:08.609
I don't know.

29:08.609 --> 29:10.049
Used to be more than
a dozen of them,

29:10.089 --> 29:11.410
but that was a long time ago.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.210
Could be any number
of them by now.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.490
Minus the four
your husband shot.

29:17.250 --> 29:20.130
And the one that you sent
to the bone orchard.

29:45.930 --> 29:47.450
Pardon me, ma'am.

29:47.490 --> 29:50.130
I was wondering if you could
take a look at this photograph.

29:50.170 --> 29:52.450
I-I'm searching for my fiancee,
Jane Ballard.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.569
Pardon me, sir.
Take a look at this photograph.

29:54.609 --> 29:56.450
Last I knew, she was traveling
on a train of wagons.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.650
From Missouri.

29:57.690 --> 29:59.289
Been searching far and wide
for her.

29:59.329 --> 30:00.690
Yeah, she is. She's beautiful.

30:00.730 --> 30:02.250
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you for your time.

30:03.890 --> 30:05.329
Pardon me, friend.

30:05.369 --> 30:08.369
I'm...
seeking to find someone.

30:08.410 --> 30:11.210
Believe she might have traveled
here to Raphael.

30:13.289 --> 30:15.049
Name of Jane Ballard.

30:35.210 --> 30:37.130
You wouldn't happen to be

30:37.130 --> 30:39.529
the same Dan Frost
who gained such renown

30:39.529 --> 30:41.089
during the late war,
now, would you?

30:41.130 --> 30:43.690
I-I believe
you put a-a Reb general,

30:43.730 --> 30:45.769
as well as a lot of other
high-profile grays,

30:45.769 --> 30:48.329
under your belt early on in
the conflict. Is that correct?

30:48.369 --> 30:50.730
Why, he don't look like
no hero to me.

30:53.690 --> 30:55.890
He look more like Spoons.

30:55.930 --> 30:58.250
Or kin to him.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.490
He's a-a former associate
of ours

31:00.490 --> 31:03.569
who had an unfortunate
proclivity for the pilfering

31:03.609 --> 31:05.890
of silverware.

31:05.930 --> 31:09.049
He's no longer under my employ.

31:09.089 --> 31:10.930
He's dead.

31:14.410 --> 31:17.170
Beauregard carried this
in Shiloh.

31:17.210 --> 31:19.250
Now, that is the prize
of my collection.

31:21.250 --> 31:24.329
Did you know that Shiloh means
"place of peace" in Hebrew?

31:28.210 --> 31:30.329
Ain't nothing peaceful
about Shiloh.

31:30.369 --> 31:32.930
No, indeed.

31:33.970 --> 31:34.890
Indeed.

31:40.609 --> 31:42.450
So, what is your...

31:42.450 --> 31:46.210
interest here, Mr. Frost,
in that woman?

31:46.250 --> 31:49.849
I know that she traveled west
with a train of wagons.

31:49.890 --> 31:52.089
Wagons belonging to you.

31:52.130 --> 31:54.329
And I've been
tracking her path.

31:54.369 --> 31:56.410
Why would you do that?

31:56.450 --> 31:58.049
She's my fiancee.

31:58.089 --> 32:00.170
And I...

32:00.210 --> 32:02.009
I hope to bring her home.

32:02.049 --> 32:05.970
Then I suggest you find
Bill Hammond there, Sure Shot.

32:09.849 --> 32:11.450
Who's Bill Hammond?

32:17.130 --> 32:19.130
Who's Bill Hammond?

32:19.170 --> 32:21.009
Bill Hammond...

32:22.809 --> 32:25.170
is another former associate
of ours.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.690
He fixated on Jane
along the journey.

32:28.690 --> 32:30.930
He absconded with her
in the dead of night.

32:30.930 --> 32:34.089
They haven't been seen
in roughly a year's time.

32:34.130 --> 32:37.369
Now, we searched for them,
naturally, but...

32:37.410 --> 32:40.009
well, it's a big country.

32:42.650 --> 32:45.970
There's negatives
and positives here, Mr. Frost.

32:48.450 --> 32:50.569
The negative is that...

32:50.609 --> 32:53.849
Bill Hammond is a wretched
and remorseless individual.

32:53.890 --> 32:56.329
The positive is
that I would presume

32:56.369 --> 32:59.289
that he's kept Jane alive.

32:59.329 --> 33:01.210
Now, I imagine
one could fight a case

33:01.250 --> 33:05.049
for that also being a negative,
now I come to think on it.

33:07.130 --> 33:08.930
He's worth 2,000.

33:08.970 --> 33:11.170
Now, I would be happy
to double that

33:11.210 --> 33:12.690
if you saw fit to bring Hammond

33:12.730 --> 33:14.930
back here to Raphael
for a reckoning.

33:14.930 --> 33:16.569
I'd like to offer you

33:16.609 --> 33:19.569
two of my best men
to assist you in your quest.

33:21.170 --> 33:24.049
Now, what befell Jane is
very troubling to all of us,

33:24.089 --> 33:27.210
and we would like to help you
to set it right.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.609
Shall I have the men saddle up?

33:33.089 --> 33:36.009
Well, with respect...

33:36.049 --> 33:38.009
I...

33:38.009 --> 33:40.250
I prefer to ride alone.

33:51.609 --> 33:56.329
If you cannot hold your tongue,
I will cut it out of your head.

34:03.970 --> 34:05.369
Goddamn it.

34:08.449 --> 34:10.489
Where's my horse?

34:11.929 --> 34:14.530
Best chance we got.

34:14.570 --> 34:17.170
If they only see
the one horse...

34:19.250 --> 34:21.369
you're home alone.

34:25.289 --> 34:28.889
Listen, if it all falls down,

34:28.929 --> 34:31.329
we're gonna need an escape.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.889
Now, you say that you can
ride up that ridge

34:33.889 --> 34:35.329
but not down.

34:35.369 --> 34:37.690
Does that mean
y-you've ever ridden it?

34:40.130 --> 34:43.730
Ham's not fit
to get on a horse, Dan.

35:00.690 --> 35:02.730
Well, all right, then.

35:06.889 --> 35:09.289
Well, I'm gonna need
your help, then.

35:09.329 --> 35:10.730
I'm gonna need you to fetch

35:10.769 --> 35:12.329
all the wooden planks
that are inside the shed,

35:12.369 --> 35:14.530
and I need you to pile them up
on the porch,

35:14.570 --> 35:16.369
and I'm gonna need to take
a look inside the house.

35:31.050 --> 35:32.730
Ham.

35:32.769 --> 35:34.849
This is the help
I told you about.

36:16.769 --> 36:18.730
I'll start a fire, all right?

36:26.809 --> 36:28.409
No, no.

36:28.449 --> 36:30.250
Jane.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.130
No fire.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.969
Smoke is like waving a flag.

36:36.929 --> 36:39.369
You know, if he's cold, he...

36:39.409 --> 36:41.610
he can piss all on himself.

36:53.489 --> 36:56.170
What's this? What's in here?

37:25.090 --> 37:27.570
So how old's the child now?

37:31.650 --> 37:33.329
She's five.

37:35.130 --> 37:37.610
Took her to my friend's.

37:49.769 --> 37:51.409
Kerosene that you got
in the shed...

37:51.449 --> 37:53.329
You got any more of that?

37:54.929 --> 37:57.170
Think I got a couple more tins
in the kitchen.

37:57.210 --> 37:58.530
All right.

37:58.570 --> 38:01.409
I'm gonna need you
to empty all of these.

38:06.130 --> 38:08.210
Jane.

39:35.769 --> 39:37.409
Go around the ridge!

39:37.449 --> 39:39.409
Take your men to the east!

40:04.929 --> 40:06.369
Jane!

40:07.409 --> 40:08.889
Jane!

40:10.809 --> 40:12.530
Where are we going?

40:12.570 --> 40:14.329
It's a surprise.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.610
Just wait.

40:18.889 --> 40:20.650
They're not gonna let you

40:20.690 --> 40:22.650
in the army
if you run like that.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.929
Hey!

40:32.969 --> 40:34.489
Jane!

40:34.489 --> 40:36.489
Come on!

40:36.530 --> 40:38.489
Come on, cousin!

40:38.489 --> 40:41.769
We only got an hour
before we pack up for Topeka!

40:41.809 --> 40:43.610
Come on, get a move on!

40:56.409 --> 40:57.369
Dan.

40:57.409 --> 40:58.329
How are you?

40:58.369 --> 40:59.769
Come on board, Dan.

41:01.730 --> 41:04.449
All right,
squeeze by there, partner.

41:04.489 --> 41:05.969
There we go.

41:08.690 --> 41:10.929
All right, little cousin,
hold on for the ride.

41:18.849 --> 41:21.530
Wonder if we'll be able
to see the ocean from here.

41:23.289 --> 41:26.369
What if we just stayed up here
and never came down?

41:26.409 --> 41:27.570
Wouldn't that be something?

41:27.610 --> 41:29.250
That would be something.

41:35.050 --> 41:36.610
My.

41:55.809 --> 41:58.650
That's Dan Frost, ain't it?

42:02.130 --> 42:04.449
You told me he was dead.

42:10.969 --> 42:12.730
I thought he was.

42:23.610 --> 42:26.329
He was the only one
I could go to.

42:29.730 --> 42:31.610
This is a job for him.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.489
Nothing more.

42:49.170 --> 42:51.130
Jars are empty.

42:54.849 --> 42:57.329
I need you to fill
about 20 of them with kerosene.

42:57.369 --> 42:59.050
And leave two fingers
at the top.

42:59.090 --> 43:01.929
And break some of
the bottles into shards, too.

43:01.969 --> 43:04.730
And round up all the nails
you got left.

43:28.809 --> 43:31.530
Why'd you change your mind
to help me?

43:34.489 --> 43:36.570
I don't know.

43:40.329 --> 43:42.289
Well, I'm grateful
that you did.

43:42.329 --> 43:44.449
Well, that's okay.
I got all the gratitude I need

43:44.489 --> 43:46.530
right here
rolled up in my pocket.

43:49.889 --> 43:51.650
You are such a prick.

43:51.690 --> 43:53.570
A prick that's come
to protect you

43:53.610 --> 43:55.889
and your piece of shit husband.

43:55.929 --> 43:57.769
You don't know
the first thing about Ham.

43:57.769 --> 43:59.849
Well, I know
that he's a criminal.

44:01.130 --> 44:02.809
You know, he could've taken
those five bullets

44:02.849 --> 44:06.250
and laid down
by some pretty river somewhere

44:06.250 --> 44:08.809
and let the Lord take him.

44:08.809 --> 44:11.210
What kind of man brings
that shit home to his wife?

44:11.250 --> 44:13.690
The kind of man
who doesn't quit.

44:13.730 --> 44:16.690
The kind of man who always
comes home, no matter what.

44:16.730 --> 44:18.250
Goddamn it!

44:20.289 --> 44:22.809
I came home, Jane.

44:22.849 --> 44:23.889
And you were gone.

44:23.889 --> 44:26.809
And I rode halfway across
the damn country

44:26.849 --> 44:28.409
looking for you.

44:28.449 --> 44:29.730
Yeah, showing your picture
to everybody

44:29.769 --> 44:33.090
from Missouri to New Mexico
like a beggar.

44:33.130 --> 44:35.409
When? When was that?

44:35.409 --> 44:37.010
'Cause I waited
for three years, Dan.

44:37.050 --> 44:38.409
You might as well been dead.

44:38.449 --> 44:40.210
If I were dead,
you would've seen my name

44:40.250 --> 44:42.289
on the list at the post office;
that's how it works.

44:42.329 --> 44:44.809
Well, if you'd been alive,
I would've seen my name

44:44.849 --> 44:47.329
on a letter
at that same post office, Dan.

44:47.369 --> 44:48.489
Hell, you got tired of waiting,

44:48.530 --> 44:50.090
you just found yourself
an outlaw.

44:50.130 --> 44:53.050
I guess a fickle woman's
grief moves very quickly.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.130
What would you know
about grief?

45:03.570 --> 45:04.650
You know what, Dan?

45:04.690 --> 45:06.289
You might want to see a day

45:06.289 --> 45:08.849
where the sun don't just shine
on your story.

45:08.889 --> 45:11.170
'Cause there is
a whole world out there

45:11.210 --> 45:15.329
of other people's tales,
you just care and listen.

45:15.369 --> 45:16.969
Okay, well,
if we get through this,

45:17.010 --> 45:19.050
you can tell me
all about it, Jane.

45:19.090 --> 45:20.969
But right now,
I'm busy digging.

45:21.010 --> 45:23.369
Probably our graves.

46:12.849 --> 46:15.050
Dan. I'm getting the dynamite.

47:32.610 --> 47:34.329
Howdy, friend.

47:34.329 --> 47:37.250
You didn't happen to see
an Appaloosa

47:37.250 --> 47:39.130
back there on the trail?

47:40.090 --> 47:42.130
With no rider, no saddle?

47:47.010 --> 47:50.210
Pea-brain wife gone
and left the gate open again.

47:52.610 --> 47:55.130
No.

47:55.170 --> 47:57.570
Maybe you seen
what I'm looking for.

47:57.610 --> 48:00.289
I don't know. What's that?

48:00.289 --> 48:03.329
Fella by the name
of Bill Hammond.

48:03.369 --> 48:05.170
Little on the big side.

48:07.530 --> 48:10.050
A little shot up.

48:14.329 --> 48:16.010
No, sir.

48:16.050 --> 48:18.809
This here is my property,
and...

48:18.849 --> 48:22.210
You telling me to get
off your property, mister?

48:22.210 --> 48:23.929
Well, no.

48:23.969 --> 48:25.889
It's just,
I would've seen a man

48:25.929 --> 48:28.130
bleeding on my property is all.

48:29.809 --> 48:33.889
Well, this here is the last
place out here for miles.

48:33.889 --> 48:37.730
Next house
is over yonder ridge.

48:37.769 --> 48:40.449
Couple by the name of Johnson.

48:40.489 --> 48:43.090
Everything else you probably
would've seen the way you came.

48:45.170 --> 48:47.809
And that there ridge...

48:47.849 --> 48:50.369
that's the end
of the line, mister.

48:54.690 --> 48:56.570
I know you?

49:21.769 --> 49:24.769
I damn sure know her.

50:02.369 --> 50:04.690
Where are the rest of them?

50:09.449 --> 50:10.889
Where are they?

50:16.730 --> 50:18.050
I said, where are they?

50:19.969 --> 50:23.769
All over this fucking valley,
you goddamn cocksucker.

50:28.170 --> 50:29.610
How many?

50:32.010 --> 50:33.289
Are you deaf?

50:35.530 --> 50:38.369
I said, how many?!

50:38.409 --> 50:39.650
Maybe ten.

50:42.769 --> 50:44.849
Could be a hundred.

50:51.690 --> 50:52.730
Minus one.

50:58.690 --> 51:00.409
Getting his horse.

51:18.530 --> 51:20.409
What'd you do with the body?

51:20.449 --> 51:23.210
I buried him under some rocks.

51:23.250 --> 51:25.010
I don't want that bastard
on my land.

51:25.050 --> 51:26.250
We get through this, Jane,

51:26.289 --> 51:30.010
I will be happy
to move him for you.

51:30.050 --> 51:32.530
It pain you to take a life
like that?

51:32.530 --> 51:35.329
Pain me a lot more
to let him do it to me.

51:41.610 --> 51:45.530
Only point of a battle, Jane,
is to end it in your favor.

51:47.969 --> 51:49.170
You kill the other guy.

51:49.210 --> 51:51.010
Otherwise, he'll kill you.

52:03.409 --> 52:05.449
You know, fear is good, Jane.

52:09.010 --> 52:11.530
Fear will keep you alive.

52:17.610 --> 52:19.650
We're gonna be outnumbered.

52:22.369 --> 52:24.409
The hell with numbers.

52:31.570 --> 52:35.010
We had the Johnnies outnumbered
well and truly.

52:35.050 --> 52:38.090
You know, it took us four years

52:38.130 --> 52:41.050
to do what we should've done
in a few months,

52:41.050 --> 52:44.329
because they had
will and purpose.

52:44.369 --> 52:47.769
If you got those two things,
numbers ain't shit.

52:47.809 --> 52:50.849
Now, I didn't understand that
until I went through it myself.

52:50.889 --> 52:53.530
Lived it.

52:53.570 --> 52:57.210
The Rebels, they captured me
just outside of Seven Pines.

52:58.809 --> 53:00.690
And they put me
in a prison camp

53:00.730 --> 53:02.929
not a lot of men
made it out of.

53:05.289 --> 53:07.570
It's the ones that had
something really strong

53:07.610 --> 53:09.690
to hold on for.

53:12.530 --> 53:16.090
If I didn't have
a picture of you...

53:16.090 --> 53:18.130
in my mind's eye...

53:18.170 --> 53:20.610
I never would've made it.

53:22.969 --> 53:25.650
A man loses purpose,

53:25.690 --> 53:27.730
that's when a man dies.

53:32.650 --> 53:35.969
After the war
ended, they let us go.

53:36.010 --> 53:37.250
Jane.

53:37.289 --> 53:39.610
I gotta get to work.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.250
The first thing I did

53:41.289 --> 53:43.329
was come looking for you.

53:45.769 --> 53:49.170
When I finally found you...

53:49.210 --> 53:51.849
seeing you holding
another man's child...

53:54.090 --> 53:55.690
She's a good girl.

53:55.730 --> 53:58.369
I knew
you weren't mine no more.

54:02.730 --> 54:07.090
And that did something to me
that the war never could.

55:21.090 --> 55:23.250
What's the matter, outlaw?

55:23.289 --> 55:25.329
Don't tell me
you got a problem with a-a...

55:25.369 --> 55:29.130
a man taking a thing
that don't belong to him.

55:30.849 --> 55:34.289
Acting like he got a claim
to putting his hand

55:34.329 --> 55:36.530
on something that he don't?

55:40.889 --> 55:42.730
Here you go.

56:04.409 --> 56:07.610
A man pays for everything
he takes, Hammond.

56:07.650 --> 56:09.489
You're no different.

56:13.130 --> 56:16.289
I've been wanting
to kill you all day.

56:20.849 --> 56:23.050
You know,
I've seen a lot of men carry

56:23.050 --> 56:26.250
that same look of death
that you got right now.

56:27.889 --> 56:31.530
Yeah, you're fixin' to make
the very big jump, my friend.

56:34.130 --> 56:36.210
Straight to perdition.

56:38.530 --> 56:40.610
And while you're burning...

56:40.650 --> 56:43.849
just know that Jane and I
will be right up above you.

56:43.889 --> 56:46.090
And I want you to...

56:57.610 --> 56:59.570
I want you
to think about that

56:59.610 --> 57:02.849
with the shank of time
that you got left.

57:10.250 --> 57:14.369
Don't know what it is
you ever see in that man, Jane.

57:16.489 --> 57:18.369
You want to have

57:18.409 --> 57:20.489
a word with us, Hammond?

57:20.489 --> 57:23.530
Well, you know
what I been thinking, boys?

57:25.530 --> 57:28.449
I'm starting to take a shine
to that Jane over there.

57:28.489 --> 57:30.530
We did notice that.

57:34.889 --> 57:37.329
Well, I was fixin'
to go and declare myself...

57:38.329 --> 57:39.889
in Raphael.

57:39.889 --> 57:41.090
You want to keep Jane?

57:41.130 --> 57:42.409
-Like to.
-For yourself?

57:42.449 --> 57:45.170
Yep. Settle down.

57:45.210 --> 57:47.090
Were you fixin' on
marrying her?

57:47.130 --> 57:49.010
Intend to ask her.

57:49.050 --> 57:51.210
Girl like that
could set me straight.

57:51.257 --> 57:53.498
Man gets tired
of running from the law.

57:53.534 --> 57:55.130
Well, come on, now.
Think about it.

57:55.172 --> 57:57.936
A woman like that... how much
money she'd make for me.

58:06.889 --> 58:08.574
Wait, wait, wait. -Now,
Hammond, Hammond, Hammond.

58:08.617 --> 58:10.170
-Easy now here, Hammond.
-Calm down.

58:10.213 --> 58:11.614
Now I'm starting
to have a problem.

58:11.650 --> 58:14.250
The problem is that
that is not your property.

58:14.289 --> 58:16.610
You telling me
she's your property?

58:16.650 --> 58:18.090
The money that she's worth...

58:18.130 --> 58:19.889
-Are you fuckin' kidding me?
-This is just horseshit.

58:19.929 --> 58:21.650
-Easy, Ham.
-We'll talk about it in the...

58:56.010 --> 58:58.050
Fixed the wagon.

59:00.769 --> 59:02.769
They don't show by dawn,

59:02.769 --> 59:05.650
I say we load Ham up...

59:05.650 --> 59:07.210
try the ridge.

59:13.130 --> 59:15.489
What about your daughter?

59:16.650 --> 59:20.090
She stays with Bekah
till we get settled.

59:33.250 --> 59:35.369
Jane.

59:37.289 --> 59:40.489
You can let the sun shine
on your story...

59:40.530 --> 59:43.730
if you s...
still have a mind to.

59:46.170 --> 59:48.210
Not much sun in my story.

59:54.449 --> 59:56.889
Yeah.

01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:13.369
War was...

01:00:13.369 --> 01:00:15.369
ceaseless, you know.

01:00:17.369 --> 01:00:19.489
The smell of death...

01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:23.369
everywhere.

01:00:23.409 --> 01:00:27.130
Our road we used
to walk to town...

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:30.369
I saw...
I saw dead bodies hangin'.

01:00:34.889 --> 01:00:37.730
Girls I knew, widows,
they said...

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:42.050
said they were
going out west,

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:44.610
town called...

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:47.650
Raphael, New Mexico.

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:54.289
And sunshine all day and silver
streaming from the hills.

01:00:58.849 --> 01:01:01.289
You weren't there.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.250
So I...

01:01:10.289 --> 01:01:12.329
decided we should go.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:17.570
And Bishops,
they offered protection, but...

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:22.210
they had other intentions.

01:01:24.809 --> 01:01:27.969
Bishop was setting up
a new town.

01:01:27.969 --> 01:01:31.130
What's a town
without a cathouse?

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:34.489
And then, of course,
you need girls.

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:37.530
Girls with no one
to protect 'em.

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:52.289
That man dying down there...

01:01:52.329 --> 01:01:54.329
one you call a criminal...

01:01:55.969 --> 01:01:59.449
he was the only one
who tried to stop 'em.

01:01:59.489 --> 01:02:01.289
He was the only one.

01:02:02.489 --> 01:02:04.530
He tried to help us.

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:07.289
Who's "us," Jane?

01:02:07.329 --> 01:02:09.570
You keep saying "us."

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:20.489
Two months after you left,
I found out I was with child.

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:27.889
I named her Mary
after your mother.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:40.809
Hey, Vic.

01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:43.690
You seen where Jane's at?

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.530
In Lullaby with Bishop.
Workin'.

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:54.849
And what about Mary?

01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:57.250
Mary.

01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:59.369
Bishop told me
to take care of her.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:03.369
Wasn't sure what he meant by
that, so I just took a guess.

01:03:06.889 --> 01:03:09.050
Did you know she couldn't swim?

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:22.409
We were just outside Raphael

01:03:22.449 --> 01:03:24.409
when they took us.

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.650
Ham tried to go find Mary.

01:03:31.489 --> 01:03:33.530
It was too late.

01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:37.489
So, yeah...

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:39.849
I settled with another man.

01:03:41.849 --> 01:03:43.769
Had another child.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.130
That girl
you rode so far to see...

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:55.329
I ain't her anymore.

01:03:55.369 --> 01:03:57.929
Life stopped being

01:03:57.969 --> 01:04:00.730
something that you live
after that day.

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:06.650
Just something you endure.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.099
Shit!*

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.340
Ham! Ham!
You piece of shit!

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.980
Ham!

01:04:26.019 --> 01:04:27.099
Easy, Ham.

01:04:27.099 --> 01:04:29.139
Easy. I didn't do nothing.

01:04:38.139 --> 01:04:39.820
Mary?

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.860
Jane.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.300
Jane, get up.

01:05:32.059 --> 01:05:34.300
That day I came to your house,

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.219
that first time, I...

01:05:36.219 --> 01:05:38.340
I wanted to tell you.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.500
You were so filled with hate.

01:05:54.059 --> 01:05:57.340
Do you think that Bishop
is gonna come himself?

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:00.380
Or is he gonna send his men
to do his bidding?

01:06:02.139 --> 01:06:03.619
He'll come.

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:06.139
He wants more than Ham.

01:06:12.579 --> 01:06:14.659
I pray that he comes.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.300
Well, this is not
how I pictured

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.619
life turning out, Jane.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.219
How did you see it?

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:37.139
Mostly from up high.

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:42.860
I'd imagine...

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:46.500
we just never came down
that day.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.579
Just chose to live in the sky.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.860
It's hard to remember though...

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.420
how things seemed
when you know...

01:07:58.539 --> 01:08:01.820
how they actually
turned out.

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:21.420
You have to go, Jane.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.979
You gotta get your girl
and get clear of all this.

01:08:26.899 --> 01:08:29.380
I've been running
my whole life.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.180
Doesn't end.

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:41.300
They come to my house...

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.380
I'm gonna protect it.

01:08:49.578 --> 01:08:52.939
Whatever happens,
I gotta put my face to it.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.460
Jane?

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:12.300
You got 30 seconds
to get your pretty self inside

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.619
and send us Bill Hammond.

01:10:14.659 --> 01:10:18.100
If he comes out, you live.

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:22.300
If he don't, then we're just
getting started here.

01:10:31.699 --> 01:10:33.300
Are you okay?

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.579
Jane! Tick-tock!

01:10:51.619 --> 01:10:53.779
You're gonna be
all right, okay?

01:10:56.659 --> 01:10:59.060
Time's up, Jane!

01:11:06.779 --> 01:11:07.819
Jane.

01:11:07.859 --> 01:11:09.819
You leave with him.

01:11:09.859 --> 01:11:11.300
You get out of here.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.140
-Go.
-You don't talk like that.

01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:16.979
We're all leaving here
together.

01:11:28.579 --> 01:11:31.380
Come on.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.060
Hold on tight.

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.300
You hold on.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.859
Son of a bitch.

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:20.340
Jane! We have to get him
down below.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.300
Hurry. We'll get you safe.

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.779
You hang on, Ham.

01:12:47.939 --> 01:12:49.460
You'll make it through.

01:12:56.979 --> 01:12:58.539
Get him up.

01:13:20.539 --> 01:13:22.659
Can you hold that?

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.699
Anybody ain't us
opens that door,

01:13:25.699 --> 01:13:27.100
you gotta start shooting.

01:13:32.979 --> 01:13:34.819
Jane, get a lantern.

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.859
Get behind the bed. Cover me.

01:16:19.979 --> 01:16:21.180
Jane!

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:23.260
Jane!

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.579
It's okay.

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.460
Ready?

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:34.859
One, two...

01:16:34.899 --> 01:16:36.659
You didn't think it was over,

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:38.739
did you, Jane?

01:16:40.659 --> 01:16:43.300
I'm gonna burn the house down!

01:16:54.979 --> 01:16:57.500
Jane, listen to me.
Look at me, look at me.

01:16:57.539 --> 01:17:01.300
You and me,
we're gonna make the ridge.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.979
All right? All right.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.100
Just hang in there.

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.460
We are so close.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.460
Now, listen,
we're gonna get your girl.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.100
We're gonna light out
for California.

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.340
Does that sound good?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.380
Doesn't that sound good?

01:17:54.859 --> 01:17:56.899
Hands high.

01:18:00.979 --> 01:18:02.979
Now, Hammond's dead.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.460
You can take what you came for.

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:09.659
I will.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.260
Drop the guns.

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.380
Dan Frost.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.340
You still have a taste
for battle, I see.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.899
Now, you say
our friend Ham has passed?

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.979
Love to hear
how the three of you

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.899
ended up
playing house here, but...

01:18:59.939 --> 01:19:02.140
well, that's a tale
for another time.

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:07.979
Let's go see Jane.

01:20:04.899 --> 01:20:07.500
That your handiwork or mine?

01:20:07.539 --> 01:20:09.340
No.

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.100
That's on you.

01:20:21.979 --> 01:20:23.819
Where is she?

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.260
I don't know.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.859
Jane!

01:20:43.899 --> 01:20:46.500
Putting a bullet
in your boyfriend!

01:20:46.539 --> 01:20:49.340
You're gonna shoot me in the
back like the coward you are?

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:57.020
It appears she's left you
once again, Mr. Frost.

01:21:01.779 --> 01:21:04.859
You so much as flinch
and I will blow your head off.

01:21:04.899 --> 01:21:07.340
Drop 'em.

01:21:09.739 --> 01:21:11.140
Now!

01:21:15.779 --> 01:21:17.819
Turn around.

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.659
-Now, Jane...
-You don't even want to know

01:21:22.699 --> 01:21:25.100
what a mother comes up with
when someone kills their child.

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.340
Shooting you
didn't even make my list.

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.859
It's too kind.

01:21:28.899 --> 01:21:31.979
Your child's not dead, Jane.

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.340
-What?
-Mary is alive.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.779
You're a fuckin' liar.

01:21:36.779 --> 01:21:39.260
No, Vic told Bill Hammond
that your daughter was killed.

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.619
I don't know what to tell you

01:21:40.619 --> 01:21:42.619
other than to offer that
my brother has always had

01:21:42.659 --> 01:21:45.020
a troubled sense of humor.
Now, I may be an outlaw,

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:47.899
but I don't kill
little children, Jane.

01:21:49.899 --> 01:21:51.300
It's a trick, Jane!
Shoot him or I will!

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.140
I swear! I swear
that she's alive and well!

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.060
I'll gladly take you to her.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.619
Where is my daughter?!

01:21:58.659 --> 01:22:00.060
Where is she?!

01:22:01.659 --> 01:22:04.699
Now, but, Jane,
if I tell you that,

01:22:04.739 --> 01:22:06.859
what am I left with?

01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.460
Nothing.

01:22:15.819 --> 01:22:17.260
Where...

01:22:20.979 --> 01:22:22.060
is...

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.819
my...

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.380
child?!

01:22:29.659 --> 01:22:31.460
Jane!

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.859
Are you countin'?

01:22:32.899 --> 01:22:34.140
'Cause I still got
a pair of bullets

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:37.380
and a question
that I ain't gonna ask again!

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.420
You know where she is, Jane.

01:22:42.939 --> 01:22:46.340
Everyone misses you there.

01:23:32.939 --> 01:23:35.340
Mary?

01:23:50.899 --> 01:23:53.220
Mama?

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:15.380
We're gonna put him
in a wooden coffin

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:16.979
and stand him on the corner
over there.

01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.140
I want every man,
woman and child

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.739
to see what
this son of a bitch looks like.

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:28.739
All right.

01:26:28.779 --> 01:26:31.500
Girls, you want
to give your mom the flowers?

01:26:31.539 --> 01:26:33.939
Thank you. Thank you.

01:26:38.579 --> 01:26:41.180
All right. Shall we?

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.779
Let's go.
