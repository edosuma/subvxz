Why are you taking stuff off?
It's gonna be lame.

09:50.734 --> 09:52.433
It's gonna be lame."
I said, "Kylie, you don't

09:52.433 --> 09:54.600
understand.
We just want to go to your house

09:54.600 --> 09:59.200
and hang out."
>> KIM: That's so frustrating.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.066
>> KENDALL: It's crazy, 'cause
Kylie and I will, like, start

10:02.066 --> 10:04.834
with an initial idea.
We'll both get involved in it,

10:04.834 --> 10:08.300
and then I think that, like,
somewhere along the line, she

10:08.300 --> 10:11.100
gets, like, bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.934
And that's so not me.
So, at the end of it, we, like,

10:14.934 --> 10:19.100
come back to it, and there's two
completely different ideas or,

10:19.100 --> 10:22.133
like, perceptions.
So we-we end up butting heads

10:22.133 --> 10:25.300
sometimes, but I'm more mad at
myself for just getting myself

10:25.300 --> 10:29.333
into this situation.
>> KHLOE: I put my fitness line

10:29.333 --> 10:32.400
on hold because I think it would
be fun and great for us to do

10:32.400 --> 10:35.100
that venture together.
I just want you to take it

10:35.100 --> 10:38.066
seriously.
>> JENNIFER: Kris, were there

10:38.066 --> 10:47.133
signs that Bruce, at the time,
wanted to become a woman?

like salads so much.

10:53.066 --> 10:55.500
>> PENELOPE: I like those.
>> KHLOE: (gasp) Oh, yeah, why

10:55.500 --> 10:57.900
can't you eat those again?
>> PENELOPE: Because they're not

10:57.900 --> 11:00.467
gluten-free.
>> KHLOE: Man.

11:00.467 --> 11:03.100
>> PENELOPE: And they're yummy.
>> KHLOE: I know. That stinks.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.133
>> KOURTNEY: She snuck a couple.
>> KHLOE: (gasp) You snuck a

11:05.133 --> 11:07.133
couple? What?
>> PENELOPE: Yeah.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.900
>> KHLOE: How many?
>> PENELOPE: Two.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.667
>> KHLOE: (gasp) What?
It's okay, I won't tell anyone.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.667
Shh.
>> KOURTNEY: Um...

11:13.667 --> 11:15.433
>> PENELOPE: Don't tell Mason.
>> KOURTNEY: I think I could

11:15.433 --> 11:19.033
definitely start with at least
the design meetings.

11:19.033 --> 11:21.667
>> KHLOE: I just want you to,
like, take it seriously.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.200
I know you do, but sometimes,
'cause of your kids and you're

11:24.200 --> 11:26.200
so busy...
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.367
>> KHLOE: ...that you don't
really complete or, like, follow

11:28.367 --> 11:30.700
through.
>> KOURTNEY: No, but I'm happy

11:30.700 --> 11:34.367
to also take over with Nima and
have the design convos, since,

11:34.367 --> 11:36.700
like, if you're not in town or
whatever.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.300
>> KHLOE: I want to be involved
because you and I have a little

11:39.300 --> 11:43.333
different aesthetic.
I have put my fitness clothing

11:43.333 --> 11:46.367
line on hold because I like
working with my sisters.

11:46.367 --> 11:48.900
And I think it would be fun and
great for us to do that venture

11:48.900 --> 11:52.166
together.
My partners are obviously

11:52.166 --> 11:54.467
really disappointed.
We've put a lot of time and

11:54.467 --> 11:56.967
money into the fitness line
already.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.934
But I love working with Kourt.
I love that she's passionate and

11:59.934 --> 12:03.033
excited about something.
So I'm fine tabling my Good

12:03.033 --> 12:05.500
American athleisure line for a
minute.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.834
I need to see how passionate
Kourtney is, but I will say, the

12:08.834 --> 12:12.767
stakes are really high.
You don't get second chances

12:12.767 --> 12:15.000
really in fashion.
Not right out of the gate.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.500
You really are gonna have to
earn those stripes.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.166
If you do want to take the lead
and start some of those

12:21.166 --> 12:24.367
conversations, that's great.
And I also think, not that you

12:24.367 --> 12:26.300
owe me anything...
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.166
>> KHLOE: ...but I also think it
would prove to me that you're

12:28.166 --> 12:30.166
taking this seriously.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.367
>> KHLOE: And it'll make me feel
like getting in bed with you

12:32.367 --> 12:36.967
even more.
Maybe this time naked.

>> KIM: When I did media
training, it was so helpful for

12:46.233 --> 12:49.734
me just to be aware of the
things I'm saying.

12:49.734 --> 12:53.533
So I just don't think the answer
is to retreat.

12:53.533 --> 12:57.433
You have to be prepared that
someday you might get asked a

12:57.433 --> 13:00.133
question that you don't want to
answer, and you should just,

13:00.133 --> 13:02.467
instead of getting flustered,
you should just be really

13:02.467 --> 13:04.433
prepared for it.
You just have to start being,

it's my job.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.400
But I can't-- I don't care
to watch myself because I don't

13:49.400 --> 13:52.333
want to know.
(Jennifer and Bill laugh)

13:52.333 --> 13:54.567
What I don't know can't hurt me.
>> JENNIFER: We're gonna change

13:54.567 --> 13:57.967
that today, because that really
needs to become a part of how

13:57.967 --> 14:01.000
you're going to get better.
>> BILL: Right. There is maybe a

14:01.000 --> 14:04.867
legion of people out there who
still have the narrative of,

14:04.867 --> 14:07.967
like, okay, so what are you guys
famous for besides being famous?

14:07.967 --> 14:10.400
And every time you go out to do
an interview, you have the

14:10.400 --> 14:13.867
opportunity for somebody to read
that or see that and say, "Wow,

14:13.867 --> 14:16.834
did you see that interview with
one of the Kardashian girls?

14:16.834 --> 14:18.934
That was really impressive.
She was really thoughtful.

14:18.934 --> 14:21.734
They seemed like really savvy,
smart, like, businesswomen."

14:21.734 --> 14:23.800
>> KRIS: Yeah.
>> BILL: Okay, so this is one

14:23.800 --> 14:26.734
thing that I think is really,
really critical, and that is

14:26.734 --> 14:30.100
we're all gonna be in situations
where we're feeling anxious.

14:30.100 --> 14:34.200
When that happens, we get this
shot of adrenaline, and when you

14:34.200 --> 14:36.533
start speaking faster, you have
less control over what you're

14:36.533 --> 14:39.133
saying.
So you have to fight your body

14:39.133 --> 14:42.333
and talk a little bit more
slowly, a little bit more

14:42.333 --> 14:45.433
deliberately, you know,
downshift and don't speed

14:45.433 --> 14:49.066
through everything.
>> KRIS: What I need help with,

14:49.066 --> 14:52.400
in that case, there are a few
things in my life I don't want

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
to talk about.
I'm done.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.567
>> BILL: I think we're trying to
get people to not be, "I won't

14:56.567 --> 14:58.533
talk about that."
>> JENNIFER: And you want to

14:58.533 --> 15:00.533
take the emotion out of it.
Right?

15:00.533 --> 15:03.300
Because that's exactly what the
reporter is looking for, is to

15:03.300 --> 15:05.767
get under your skin.
Before we do an interview, let's

15:05.767 --> 15:08.300
think of all the things that we
don't want to talk about.

15:08.300 --> 15:12.333
And let's really be thoughtful
about how we can talk about it.

15:12.333 --> 15:16.166
Maybe, Kris, if you knew exactly
what you wanted to say about

15:16.166 --> 15:18.800
Caitlyn, and really thought
about it in advance, you

15:18.800 --> 15:22.000
probably would be in a much
better position to respond.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.934
>> KIM: And I just think, with
the overall strategy, my mom has

15:24.934 --> 15:28.834
done so much, but I don't think
she gets, like, the accolades

15:28.834 --> 15:32.033
that she really deserves.
So I really want to, like, push

15:32.033 --> 15:35.734
her to start positioning herself
as the strong businesswoman and

15:35.734 --> 15:38.567
mogul that she is.
>> BILL: Mm-hmm.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.600
>> KRIS: Yeah.
>> KIM: You know, my mom, she

15:40.600 --> 15:44.500
had her own talk show, she was
so confident doing interviews,

15:44.500 --> 15:49.233
and I just think her recent life
experiences has just made her

15:49.233 --> 15:52.900
more insecure and not really
confident.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.967
And she just doesn't really know
what to say.

15:54.967 --> 15:56.967
I think she just has her guard
up.

15:56.967 --> 15:59.500
And she just, like, needs to
have this, like, comeback and

15:59.500 --> 16:03.000
figure it out and get back to
being confident again.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.100
>> BILL: Is everybody clear on
what we're gonna do next?

16:05.100 --> 16:06.834
>> KHLOE: No. What?
>> KIM: No. What are we doing

16:06.834 --> 16:08.800
next?
>> BILL: We're gonna do a group

16:08.800 --> 16:11.000
interview.
>> JENNIFER: A mock interview.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.934
>> KIM: Okay.
>> KHLOE: Oh, God.

16:12.934 --> 16:15.200
>> BILL: And, uh, we're gonna
videotape it, and then we're

16:15.200 --> 16:17.400
gonna play it back.
And we're gonna offer our

16:17.400 --> 16:21.433
feedback on what works and what
we could tweak.

16:21.433 --> 16:24.066
>> KIM: Okay.
>> KRIS: Okay.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.133
I think I've gotten to a place
in my life where I just really

16:27.133 --> 16:30.066
don't like questions from
press and media.

16:30.066 --> 16:32.166
It's a lot of work to be front
and center.

16:32.166 --> 16:34.133
It's easier to stay in the
background.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.066
>> KIM: It is.
It is a lot of pressure, but I

16:36.066 --> 16:40.166
think it's, like, fascinating
that we all have been doing

16:40.166 --> 16:43.367
media interviews for a decade,
and we've never had media

16:43.367 --> 16:45.600
training.
And that's usually one of the

16:45.600 --> 16:48.867
first things that you do when
you start off in this business.

16:48.867 --> 16:51.600
So I can't wait for them to do
it.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.834
Okay, phones down, ladies.
>> JENNIFER: Let's pretend that

16:54.834 --> 16:56.800
this is...
>> KIM: You're Megyn Kelly.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.533
>> JENNIFER: We're-we're on a
Megyn Kelly...

16:58.533 --> 17:00.533
>> KIM: And Piers Morgan.
The Hollywood

17:00.533 --> 17:03.967
has called it "The
Kardashian Decade: How a Sex

17:03.967 --> 17:06.800
Tape Led to a Billion-Dollar
Brand."

17:06.800 --> 17:09.467
What do you guys attribute to
this longevity?

17:09.467 --> 17:12.667
Why are people so fascinated by
you guys ten years later?

17:12.667 --> 17:15.000
>> KHLOE: I think that the
authenticity of our family

17:15.000 --> 17:18.500
really rings through, and I
think that with any one of us I

17:18.500 --> 17:21.400
think you're able to connect.
You could relate to Kim or

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
someone could be obsessed with
Kendall.

17:23.400 --> 17:27.100
And I think, um, following our
lives so closely, they really

17:27.100 --> 17:30.033
feel they're along for that ride
because we have been so open and

17:30.033 --> 17:32.066
honest.
>> KIM: Like they're invested.

17:32.066 --> 17:34.367
>> BILL: Do you need the show to
do that?

17:34.367 --> 17:37.233
After the life of the show,
whenever that is, does this

17:37.233 --> 17:39.700
still hold together?
>> KRIS: I think that the show

17:39.700 --> 17:42.533
is a wonderful foundation for
everything else that we do, and

17:42.533 --> 17:46.033
I think that because so many
people got emotionally invested

17:46.033 --> 17:50.333
season one, episode one and have
seen the family through

17:50.333 --> 17:53.834
everything that we've been
through, so it's everything.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.667
We-we show whatever is going on
in our lives.

17:56.667 --> 18:01.433
So it's divorce, you know,
marriages, uh, you know, births,

18:01.433 --> 18:04.033
every single thing that happens
in our lives, they get to

18:04.033 --> 18:06.800
experience.
And I don't think we've ever let

18:06.800 --> 18:08.767
them down on that.
>> KENDALL: Well, I think...

18:08.767 --> 18:10.433
I don't know if we're answering
the question.

18:10.433 --> 18:12.100
What she's asking.
I think that what she's asking

18:12.100 --> 18:13.467
is...
>> KRIS: Can it go on without

18:13.467 --> 18:14.900
us?
>> KENDALL: Yes, and I think

18:14.900 --> 18:16.533
absolutely because I think...
>> KRIS: Social media.

18:16.533 --> 18:17.867
>> KENDALL: Exactly.
I think that social media is

18:17.867 --> 18:19.333
such a big thing today, and...
>> KRIS: That's where I was

18:19.333 --> 18:21.433
going.
>> KENDALL: You were done...

18:21.433 --> 18:22.967
>> KHLOE: This is a real
interview, so...

18:22.967 --> 18:24.467
>> KIM: Yeah, you guys, this is
a real interview.

18:24.467 --> 18:26.800
>> BILL: But can you have the
unity of the family on social

18:26.800 --> 18:29.367
media like you do on television?
>> KHLOE: You know what, I feel

18:29.367 --> 18:33.400
like our show definitely gives
different layers to our lives.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.400
It's like an onion, and you're
pulling all those layers back.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.100
>> KIM: And I think you do see
our dynamic on Snapchat when

18:38.100 --> 18:40.133
there's video involved.
You do see...

18:40.133 --> 18:43.100
>> KOURTNEY: You can't fully
express your personality the

18:43.100 --> 18:45.834
same way, I think, that we do on
our show.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.967
>> KENDALL: Yeah.
>> KIM: So we're screwed when

18:47.967 --> 18:50.200
the show's over.
>> KOURTNEY: (bleep)

18:50.200 --> 18:52.533
(Bill laughs)
>> JENNIFER: Kris, looking back,

18:52.533 --> 18:56.033
were there signs that Bruce, at
the time, wanted to become a

18:56.033 --> 18:59.300
woman?
Did you turn a blind eye?

18:59.300 --> 19:01.700

Here's what I would do
differently.

difficult question because it is

23:43.367 --> 23:45.934
hypothetical, and that's not
what happened.

23:49.367 --> 23:51.133
that's when Kendall had her
first controversy...

23:51.133 --> 23:53.133
>> KENDALL: Yeah.
>> KIM: ...is because the

23:53.133 --> 23:55.467
Kardashian side has always been
so open.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.266
So if that would've happened to

23:57.266 --> 23:58.900
away.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.567
dealt with something of this
magnitude.

24:00.567 --> 24:03.100
>> BILL: You could talk about
having a false sense of security

24:03.100 --> 24:06.834
dealing with such a huge brand.
There's a certain assumption

24:06.834 --> 24:09.700
that this creative is gonna be
great.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.600
And it blew up in their face.
>> KENDALL: Yeah.

24:12.600 --> 24:16.033
I have learned so much over
the last, like, four years

24:16.033 --> 24:19.066
of my career.
I've learned that the only

24:19.066 --> 24:22.033
person that's ever gonna truly,
truly, truly look out for me is

24:22.033 --> 24:23.967
me.
And, like, it is really hard

24:23.967 --> 24:25.934
work.
>> BILL: So you can see where

24:25.934 --> 24:30.033
the, maybe one of the overriding
takeaways here is give your

24:30.033 --> 24:33.467
answers in the affirmative, not
the absence of the negative.

24:33.467 --> 24:35.266
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.
>> BILL: It projects a much more

24:35.266 --> 24:38.567
confident demeanor behind your
answers.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.567
>> KHLOE: Okay.
(phones chiming)

24:40.567 --> 24:44.600
>> KENDALL: Kylie is so crazy.
Bro, I-- this is making me,

24:44.600 --> 24:46.133
like, upset.
I'm just like, "Are you

24:46.133 --> 24:48.567
serious?"
I thought Kylie and

24:48.567 --> 24:50.700
I came to an agreement about
this whole party planning

24:50.700 --> 24:53.767
situation, and she's saying that
we have to bring everything

24:53.767 --> 24:56.033
back, and she doesn't think it's
gonna be good enough without

24:56.033 --> 24:58.133
everything.
So it's really starting to piss

24:58.133 --> 25:03.367
me off.
It's just, like, one thing after

25:03.367 --> 25:06.934
another.
This just killed my vibe.

25:06.934 --> 25:08.667
I need to go home.
>> KIM: But don't you think you

25:08.667 --> 25:11.266
would really benefit from this?
>> KENDALL: I'm literally going

25:11.266 --> 25:12.734
home.

25:16.100 --> 25:17.600
>> KHLOE: I said the place that
I love that I...

25:17.600 --> 25:19.133
>> KOURTNEY: Lycra.

25:19.133 --> 25:20.433
workout pants and...

25:20.433 --> 25:21.967
I didn't like their prints.
>> KHLOE: They're-- No, I never

25:21.967 --> 25:23.667
said the prints.
I gave it to you for quality.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.166
>> KHLOE: Sometimes I love
having a partner, but when

25:26.166 --> 25:34.100
you're just not in sync, it's a
little frustrating.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.800
>> KENDALL: I have to get out of
here.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.200

you.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.266

25:42.000 --> 25:45.600
host or an interviewer asks a
question the same way.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.967
Before they actually ask you the
question, they like to show off

25:48.967 --> 25:52.166
that they know a thing or two
about you and the topic.

25:52.166 --> 25:54.200
>> JENNIFER: Context.
>> BILL: Context, right.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.700
What you want to do is listen to
that contextual setup for key

25:57.700 --> 26:01.734
words as to where this is going.
Start thinking about what it is

26:01.734 --> 26:04.166
you want to say in the question.
>> KRIS: Got it.

26:04.166 --> 26:05.734
>> BILL: I think we're ready for
one-on-ones.

26:05.734 --> 26:08.700
>> JENNIFER: I think we're ready
for the one-on-ones.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.800
>> BILL: You know, we often say
to people that we want the

26:11.800 --> 26:15.000
interviews we do with them in
practice to be among the harder

26:15.000 --> 26:17.667
ones that they would face, so
that they're not shocked by any

26:17.667 --> 26:20.367
questions out there.
>> KHLOE: Go ahead.

26:20.367 --> 26:23.500
>> JENNIFER: You are closest to
Rob.

26:23.500 --> 26:27.133
Lately, he seems to be having
some erratic behavior.

26:27.133 --> 26:29.333
What's going on with him?
>> KHLOE: You know, Rob

26:29.333 --> 26:31.600
definitely wears his heart on
his sleeve, and when he loves,

26:31.600 --> 26:34.867
he loves really, really hard.
And with that being said, when

26:34.867 --> 26:37.200
he gets hurt, he hurts really,
really badly.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.233
>> BILL: Kourtney, I'm curious
about your decision to have your

26:40.233 --> 26:43.600
kids have such a public life.
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.834
>> BILL: To be in the show.
>> JENNIFER: Scott is front and

26:45.834 --> 26:47.934
center.
His infidelity, his drinking

26:47.934 --> 26:50.400
problems.
The kids will be able to,

26:50.400 --> 26:54.266
like, find these shows online.
How will you explain it to them?

26:54.266 --> 26:56.467
>> KOURTNEY: I'll just say
none of it's true.

26:56.467 --> 27:00.100
>> JENNIFER: Today, you've found
love again with a man who's 26

27:00.100 --> 27:02.300
years younger.
>> KRIS: Is he 26 years younger?

27:02.300 --> 27:03.900
>> JENNIFER: That's what--
that's what the reports say.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.333
>> KRIS: Wow. Okay.
>> JENNIFER: So what's going on

27:06.333 --> 27:08.667
with you and Corey?
Will you marry him?

27:08.667 --> 27:11.533
Are you going to get remarried?
>> KRIS: I don't think I-I would

27:11.533 --> 27:15.000
ever feel the need to ever get
married again.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.066
>> JENNIFER: You stuck by Lamar,
but when it came to Caitlyn, you

27:17.066 --> 27:19.300
didn't seem to have that same
understanding.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.300
Why is that?
>> KHLOE: You know what?

27:21.300 --> 27:23.300
I actually was really
understanding and supportive of

27:23.300 --> 27:26.533
Caitlyn.
Um, I think that the public has

27:26.533 --> 27:29.633
a different perception.
>> JENNIFER: Kourtney, I imagine

27:29.633 --> 27:32.667
you're deluged with proposals,
business partnerships.

27:32.667 --> 27:35.967
What are some of the things that
you're looking for in order to

27:35.967 --> 27:37.834
decide whether you want to be
involved?

27:37.834 --> 27:40.066
>> KOURTNEY: I think, at this
point in my life, you know, it's

27:40.066 --> 27:44.633
already a lot to balance being a
mom and working, so I really am

27:44.633 --> 27:49.367
only taking on projects that I'm
really passionate about.

27:49.367 --> 27:51.800
>> JENNIFER: What were some of
the most hurtful things in

27:51.800 --> 27:54.700
Caitlyn's book?
>> KRIS: Some of the most...

27:54.700 --> 27:58.000
Well, I think just the general
tone of the book.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.367
>> BILL: Was it mean-spirited?
>> KRIS: Very mean-spirited.

28:00.367 --> 28:03.200
A lot of inaccuracies.
I think somebody with a little

28:03.200 --> 28:07.467
elegance and class, and somebody
that's been divorced, but trying

28:07.467 --> 28:10.900
to stay on good terms with the
family might have written, "Wow.

28:10.900 --> 28:14.300
Married to her, didn't work out.
You know, she's a great girl.

28:14.300 --> 28:16.300
Wish it could've been
different."

28:16.300 --> 28:18.300
>> BILL: Okay.
Let's stop there.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.333
>> KHLOE: Thank you.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

28:20.333 --> 28:23.633
>> KRIS: Okay.
Well, that wasn't fun, but I

28:23.633 --> 28:27.934
realized that the only person
that I can control and how I

28:27.934 --> 28:30.266
react and respond to anything is
myself.

28:30.266 --> 28:35.967
And I truly do see some value in
this whole process.

watching the show, that you're

28:38.200 --> 28:41.967
closest to Rob, and lately he

this...

28:43.800 --> 28:45.600

>> BILL: You know, kind of

28:45.600 --> 28:48.967
validating he's erratic.
>> KHLOE: I mean, it was crazy.

28:48.967 --> 28:52.233
>> BILL: There's also a value of
equating yourself with other

28:52.233 --> 28:55.333
families.
You know, you-you are this

28:55.333 --> 28:59.133
subject of interest, but to make
what happens in the Kardashians

28:59.133 --> 29:01.967
universal, remind the audience
that this-this kind of stuff

29:01.967 --> 29:03.967
goes on in your family, too.
>> KHLOE: Right.

29:03.967 --> 29:05.767
>> BILL: And like any family,
this is what we did.

29:05.767 --> 29:07.600
>> KHLOE: Okay.
>> JENNIFER: Scott is front and

29:07.600 --> 29:09.600
center.
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.433
>> JENNIFER: His infidelity, his
drinking problems.

29:11.433 --> 29:13.266
(Kourtney laughs)
>> BILL: Uh, were you gonna

29:13.266 --> 29:15.266
comment on the laugh?
>> JENNIFER: Yeah.

29:15.266 --> 29:17.467
We're talking about something
really serious, about your kids

29:17.467 --> 29:19.467
and the potential for them...
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.367
>> JENNIFER: ...to see some
pretty disturbing video of them.

29:21.367 --> 29:23.367
(Kourtney laughs)
>> JENNIFER: And you're

29:23.367 --> 29:25.367
laughing.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

29:25.367 --> 29:27.233
>> BILL: It was probably a
nervous laugh, no?

29:27.233 --> 29:28.834
>> KOURTNEY: No, of course, but
I feel like it, like, lightens

29:28.834 --> 29:30.667
the mood a little.
>> JENNIFER: But the perception

29:30.667 --> 29:32.467
is that you're not taking this
seriously.

29:32.467 --> 29:34.433
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> BILL: That's right.

29:34.433 --> 29:36.066
>> JENNIFER: And that you don't
really have a plan for your kids

29:36.066 --> 29:38.367
when that time does come.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

29:38.367 --> 29:40.533
>> JENNIFER: Did you ever read
Caitlyn's book?

29:40.533 --> 29:42.600
>> KRIS: I did.
>> JENNIFER: You did?

29:42.600 --> 29:46.033
>> KRIS: I think somebody that's
been divorced, but trying to

29:46.033 --> 29:49.133

29:51.967 --> 29:53.967
Wish it could've been
different."

29:53.967 --> 29:55.834
>> BILL: I mean, you could, if
you wanted to push it a little

29:55.834 --> 29:58.266
further, say, "But of course, we
all know that that doesn't sell

29:58.266 --> 30:00.300
books."
>> KRIS: That's a good one.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.266
>> BILL: Right.
>> KRIS: We live our entire

30:02.266 --> 30:05.467
lives in front of the whole
world, and questions like this

30:05.467 --> 30:09.000
are gonna keep coming for as
long as I can foresee, so it

30:09.000 --> 30:13.066
really does help to have some
skills under my belt to be able

30:13.066 --> 30:17.000
to help just convey what I'm
trying to say.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
>> KHLOE: Bye, Keeks.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.700

30:24.500 --> 30:26.133
You got so much better.

30:26.133 --> 30:27.967
yeah.
>> JENNIFER: Yeah, just in

30:27.967 --> 30:29.700

interview.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.500
>> BILL: Really good.
>> KRIS: Good. Thank you for

30:31.500 --> 30:33.367

30:58.000 --> 30:59.834
>> KOURTNEY: I'm trying to turn

30:59.834 --> 31:03.400
>> KIM: No, you're Snapchatting.
We need to (bleep) work out.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.000
>> KHLOE: This is dedication.
Back to the grind.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.166
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, I know what I
wanted to do, Khlo, was go to

31:09.166 --> 31:13.333
Russell Simmons' place.
>> KHLOE: When? Tomorrow?

31:13.333 --> 31:15.333
>> KOURTNEY: No, no, no.
He has...

31:15.333 --> 31:17.200
>> KIM: Why?
>> KOURTNEY: He has a workout

31:17.200 --> 31:19.200
line at his yoga place, and he's
like, "I have the best

31:19.200 --> 31:21.834
manufacturer.
They only do workout clothes."

31:21.834 --> 31:25.467
And the partner owns Westfield
malls.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.667
That's why I'm almost, like, do
I just...

31:27.667 --> 31:29.900
Just, I feel like Mom needs to
find us the best workout

31:29.900 --> 31:31.900

>> KIM: You need the best of the

31:31.900 --> 31:33.900
best.
>> KHLOE: I already told you

31:33.900 --> 31:35.834
that.
The... I said the place that I

31:35.834 --> 31:37.200
love, that I...
>> KOURTNEY: Lycra.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.633
>> KHLOE: I gave you their
workout pants and...

31:38.633 --> 31:40.166
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
I didn't like their prints.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.767
>> KHLOE: They're-- No, I never
said the prints.

31:41.767 --> 31:44.800
I gave it to you for quality.
I told you they are the best

31:44.800 --> 31:46.400
quality, but they're in
Australia.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.967
And they love me and they said
they would help me with whatever

31:48.967 --> 31:50.767
I need.
But you were like, "No, let's do

31:50.767 --> 31:53.967
it this way."
Kourtney and I are a nothing

And we're just not seeing eye to

'80s thing with the socks?
>> KOURTNEY: Yes.

32:00.166 --> 32:01.600
>> KHLOE: No, it's already
expired.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.767
It's now the year 2030 all of a
sudden.

32:03.767 --> 32:05.400

So, we're gonna go Daft Punk.
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God.

32:08.567 --> 32:10.633
What is she talking about now?
>> KHLOE: Doing the fitness

32:10.633 --> 32:12.867
video took at least a year to
get off the ground.

32:12.867 --> 32:16.166
So if this fitness line is gonna
go anywhere in the same

32:16.166 --> 32:18.800
direction like the fitness
video, I want nothing to do with

32:18.800 --> 32:20.300
it.
Sometimes, I love having a

32:20.300 --> 32:22.600
partner, but when you're just
not in sync, it's a little

32:22.600 --> 32:27.300

But does that send a message to

that you want to do makes you

38:30.300 --> 38:32.800
feel better about yourself, then
why not?

38:32.800 --> 38:36.667
I think everybody has to make
their own choice.

38:36.667 --> 38:40.433
I think the experience of going
to the media training was very

38:40.433 --> 38:43.500
helpful for me, because it's
taught me that I set the tone

38:43.500 --> 38:46.266

Something that was so

39:59.066 --> 40:02.066
discouraging for me when I was
working with my sisters more is

40:02.066 --> 40:04.600
