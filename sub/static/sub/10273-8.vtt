<i>Previously on The Americans...</i>

00:05.749 --> 00:07.047
<i>I'm gonna go and see Martha.</i>

00:07.499 --> 00:09.783
I want to take her some jewelry.
Do you have anything?

00:09.851 --> 00:11.685
I'm sure she'll love it.

00:14.156 --> 00:16.724
When is the right time
to exfiltrate a source?

00:16.791 --> 00:19.426
- Never.
- She has held up her end of the bargain.

00:19.494 --> 00:21.295
You're worried
about her safety.

00:21.363 --> 00:22.730
I'll think about it.

00:22.797 --> 00:24.131
I need to ask you something.

00:24.199 --> 00:26.600
Just promise
you'll say the truth.

00:26.668 --> 00:28.669
Did something happen
between you and Irina?

00:28.737 --> 00:32.640
Nothing happened.
There's only you.

00:32.674 --> 00:34.808
It has always been you.

01:09.344 --> 01:11.678
- You were right.
- About?

01:11.730 --> 01:13.180
The Beemans--
trouble in paradise.

01:13.231 --> 01:14.515
He told you?

01:14.583 --> 01:16.951
Not in so many words.
He's not a gusher.

01:17.018 --> 01:18.819
- No. He's a trickler.
- Yeah.

01:18.853 --> 01:20.654
Information comes out
in dribs and drabs.

01:20.722 --> 01:21.956
He should call a plumber.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.059
To fix the leak.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.044
Ohh.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.046
- No?
- No.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.199
- I missed you.
- At racquetball?

01:32.250 --> 01:34.201
- Yeah, that's why I lost.
- Come on.

01:34.269 --> 01:35.836
'Cause you were thinking
about me?

01:35.887 --> 01:37.838
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.724
I haven't double-faulted
so much in my life.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.581
Trouble at work.

01:51.770 --> 01:54.154
We have to stop an assassin.

01:54.222 --> 01:55.990
- Whose?
- Ours.

01:56.057 --> 01:58.525
The Centre hired a contractor
to start killing scientists

01:58.593 --> 02:00.728
in the Americans'
antiballistic missile program.

02:00.762 --> 02:02.529
The leadership
changed its mind,

02:02.597 --> 02:04.898
and whatever system they were
using to recall him is not working.

02:06.968 --> 02:09.103
- We have a name?
- No.

02:09.169 --> 02:11.839
Do we have a description?

02:11.906 --> 02:13.507
No.

02:13.575 --> 02:15.342
Do we know when
he's gonna hit the targets?

02:15.410 --> 02:16.610
No.

02:16.645 --> 02:18.545
Do we know who the targets are?

02:18.613 --> 02:21.015
He was given
the names of 14 scientists.

02:21.082 --> 02:22.583
Oh, so all we have to do

02:22.617 --> 02:24.918
is find a highly trained killer
we know nothing about

02:24.986 --> 02:27.354
before he hits any one of
14 American scientists.

02:27.422 --> 02:30.024
- But doesn't it sound fun?
- I'll call the sitter.

02:30.091 --> 02:32.026
Oh, we're having dinner
with the Beemans on Wednesday.

02:32.093 --> 02:33.560
You're supposed to
bring your meatloaf.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.729
What are <i>you supposed to bring?</i>

02:35.780 --> 02:37.564
My winning personality.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.636
They need to straighten
things out at the Centre.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.939
Ordering hits
and countermanding them.

02:48.009 --> 02:49.443
There they are.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.314
30 years of marriage,

02:53.381 --> 02:55.783
and they're
still holding hands.

02:55.850 --> 02:57.851
That's sweet.

03:00.522 --> 03:03.324
Top-level scientist
working on a program

03:03.391 --> 03:05.159
to save this country
from nuclear weapons.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.329
And they don't have security.
Can you explain that?

03:08.396 --> 03:13.467
- They feel safe here.
- Not for much longer.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.743
Oh, no.
Car won't start.

03:29.217 --> 03:30.651
That's right.

03:36.424 --> 03:40.361
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

03:40.428 --> 03:42.763
Hurry!

03:46.501 --> 03:48.836
Well, if that doesn't get
the US government

03:48.903 --> 03:51.839
to watch its scientists' backs,
I don't know what will.

04:17.728 --> 04:19.743
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

04:24.549 --> 04:27.749
He's not a former mob
accountant in witness protection.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.651
Not a former Nazi
hiding from the Mossad.

04:30.703 --> 04:33.288
As far as
the general public is concerned,

04:33.339 --> 04:35.123
he's a scientist
specializing in

04:35.174 --> 04:37.825
navigational systems
for communications satellites.

04:37.893 --> 04:40.428
How many people
know that's not true?

04:40.496 --> 04:42.997
You. Me. A few hundred people
in the US government.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.432
The KGB?

04:44.500 --> 04:46.267
Car bombs
haven't been their MO.

04:46.335 --> 04:47.702
If they're starting

04:47.770 --> 04:49.704
to blow people up
in the middle of Washington,

04:49.772 --> 04:51.606
they're essentially
declaring war.

04:51.674 --> 04:54.175
We've identified
every important scientist

04:54.243 --> 04:55.877
in the antiballistic
missile program.

04:55.945 --> 04:57.378
We're moving them
to secure locations.

04:57.446 --> 05:00.148
Why stop there? Who knows
who else they'll go after.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.550
Oh, sure,
let's protect everyone--

05:02.618 --> 05:05.320
scientists, politicians,
our most important philosophers.

05:05.387 --> 05:07.956
They'll keep us so busy
chasing our tails

05:08.023 --> 05:10.358
we won't have any time
to chase them.

05:10.426 --> 05:13.161
So, run Customs and Immigration,
last three weeks,

05:13.229 --> 05:15.563
see who's going
in and out of the country.

05:15.631 --> 05:17.899
Other than the usual flags,
we're looking for

05:17.967 --> 05:20.702
anyone who pulled a visa
on less than two weeks' notice,

05:20.769 --> 05:22.737
and anyone entering
for the first time.

05:22.805 --> 05:24.973
They're using a false identity,

05:25.040 --> 05:26.741
my guess is
it's gonna be a fresh one.

05:26.809 --> 05:29.177
Milbank,
take the lead on surveillance,

05:29.245 --> 05:31.396
get eyes on our top priorities.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.481
Tell your wives not to wait up.

05:33.549 --> 05:35.316
Oh, they don't see us
anyway, sir.

05:35.384 --> 05:36.901
You wanted to be an FBI agent.

05:47.730 --> 05:51.766
Why would they hire a contractor
and then change their mind?

05:51.834 --> 05:55.370
Some people think it's worth
any risk to stop the Americans

05:55.437 --> 05:57.939
from getting
a ballistic missile shield.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.941
Others don't agree.

06:00.009 --> 06:01.676
Who doesn't agree with that?

06:01.744 --> 06:06.080
If we start killing scientists
on US soil,

06:06.148 --> 06:08.082
who knows where it leads?

06:08.150 --> 06:10.718
At best,
the secret war escalates.

06:10.786 --> 06:12.086
At worst...

06:15.357 --> 06:18.760
The contractor
is from West Germany.

06:18.827 --> 06:20.261
There's a strong suspicion

06:20.329 --> 06:22.964
he'll use this weapons contact
in Baltimore.

06:23.032 --> 06:24.799
Okay.

06:24.867 --> 06:28.569
Elizabeth.

06:28.604 --> 06:31.572
I know there's bad blood
between us.

06:31.607 --> 06:36.544
But... believe it or not,

06:36.612 --> 06:39.347
I feel a camaraderie with you.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.720
A camaraderie?

06:45.788 --> 06:48.423
Yes.

06:48.490 --> 06:51.926
You have a funny way
of showing that.

06:53.295 --> 06:55.430
This isn't an easy life
we've chosen.

06:55.497 --> 06:59.567
But there's no way to get
through it without the truth.

06:59.635 --> 07:03.037
What "truth" exactly
are we talking about?

07:05.074 --> 07:07.442
In New York,

07:07.509 --> 07:11.913
Philip was <i>with</i> the woman
we assigned him to.

07:11.980 --> 07:16.617
I can think of five different
reasons you'd poison our life.

07:16.685 --> 07:19.253
Ask Philip, then.

07:19.321 --> 07:21.289
I did.

07:21.357 --> 07:24.325
You believe him?

07:24.393 --> 07:27.528
If you start to think
of your marriage as real,

07:27.596 --> 07:29.297
it doesn't work.

07:29.365 --> 07:32.934
The men don't think of them
that way.

07:33.001 --> 07:36.137
It was an arrangement.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.839
Do you understand that?

07:37.906 --> 07:40.842
I understand who you are.

07:40.909 --> 07:43.478
I understand
what you just did to us.

07:43.545 --> 07:46.681
Better to live in reality,
Elizabeth.

07:46.749 --> 07:48.683
Better for you.

07:48.751 --> 07:51.018
Better for us, too.

07:52.521 --> 07:56.324
Even after this...

07:56.358 --> 07:58.860
I trust you.

07:58.927 --> 08:02.764
I know you'd throw yourself
on a fire for the Motherland.

08:04.867 --> 08:07.001
Him?

08:07.069 --> 08:10.271
I'm not so sure.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.273
How long have you been there?

08:45.340 --> 08:47.508
Not long.

08:47.576 --> 08:50.745
Mmm, drinking me in?

08:50.813 --> 08:53.581
Right.

08:53.649 --> 08:56.584
Did, uh...

08:56.652 --> 09:00.188
did grannie have anything
to say about the contractor?

09:00.255 --> 09:02.223
Yeah.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.792
Did you restrain yourself
from killing her?

09:04.860 --> 09:08.029
I'm starting
to get over the urge.

09:08.096 --> 09:11.299
Why's that?

09:11.366 --> 09:13.734
She's just doing her job.

09:13.802 --> 09:16.504
Like the rest of us.

09:26.982 --> 09:28.549
That's it for Customs.

09:28.617 --> 09:30.218
How many came through New York?

09:33.455 --> 09:35.990
- What do we got, sir?
- The rest of the East Coast.

09:36.058 --> 09:37.992
If that doesn't pan out,
we check the Midwest and Canada.

09:38.060 --> 09:41.128
Couldn't we just nuke the
Russians and get this over with?

09:41.196 --> 09:43.831
As soon as we get a full list
of international arrivals,

09:43.899 --> 09:46.601
we might even be able to
make a few phone calls, Amador,

09:46.635 --> 09:50.104
find out what hotels
anyone suspicious is staying at.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.073
Beeman.

10:01.348 --> 10:03.084
You're a responsible man,
aren't you, Beeman?

10:03.151 --> 10:04.652
Well, my father always said so.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.822
Except for the time
I wrecked his Bonneville.

10:10.425 --> 10:13.995
It's an apartment
near Eastern Market--

10:14.062 --> 10:17.181
a studio with
a back entrance off an alley.

10:17.266 --> 10:18.633
It's time you and your source

10:18.684 --> 10:20.601
started having your meetings
in a safe house.

10:20.669 --> 10:22.003
Okay.

10:22.070 --> 10:26.007
It's not a car but, uh...

10:26.074 --> 10:28.476
don't wreck it.

10:46.628 --> 10:48.195
Can I help you?

10:48.263 --> 10:50.965
Is your dad home, honey?

10:56.939 --> 10:58.673
Yeah?

10:58.740 --> 11:00.741
I know who you are,
what you do.

11:00.809 --> 11:01.976
I know
you usually get references

11:02.044 --> 11:03.210
before you talk to people.

11:03.278 --> 11:05.980
But we need to discuss
a few matters.

11:19.328 --> 11:23.164
Go up to your room, sweetheart.

11:25.901 --> 11:28.235
I don't know
who you think I am.

11:28.303 --> 11:30.905
I understand
you rely on confidentiality,

11:30.939 --> 11:32.707
and I'm going to ask you
to violate that.

11:32.774 --> 11:35.576
The alternative
is bringing people down on you

11:35.611 --> 11:37.578
who will destroy your business.

11:37.646 --> 11:40.781
You're making
a serious mistake, lady.

11:40.849 --> 11:43.084
Someone came
to purchase explosives from you

11:43.118 --> 11:44.852
in the last 72 hours.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.021
I need to know everything you
know abo--

11:48.757 --> 11:53.527
Lady, don't come into my house
and start ordering me around.

11:53.595 --> 11:55.363
All right, just take it easy,
little girl, okay?

11:55.430 --> 11:57.931
- Do I look like a little girl?
- Thank you.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.617
- Aah!
- Don't you hurt her!

11:59.701 --> 12:03.371
Easy, easy.
Nice henchman.

12:03.438 --> 12:06.907
Okay, take it easy.
It's all right, Lana.

12:06.975 --> 12:10.111
Lana? You want to go sit down,
watch some TV?

12:10.178 --> 12:12.546
You'll be able to
see dad from there, hmm?

12:12.614 --> 12:14.315
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:14.383 --> 12:16.334
Go.

12:20.622 --> 12:24.158
We better keep an eye on her.

12:24.226 --> 12:26.160
We're not
going to hurt her or you.

12:26.228 --> 12:29.430
We just need to know
what we need to know.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.265
Clients--
I talk about 'em,

12:31.333 --> 12:33.768
they come back and make sure
I can't talk again.

12:33.835 --> 12:36.604
This one won't.
We come from the same people.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.839
We just need to find him.

12:41.910 --> 12:46.681
He's about 6'4", light skin,
a little chubby.

12:46.748 --> 12:48.115
Friendly guy, actually.

12:48.183 --> 12:49.784
Always the friendly ones,
right?

12:49.835 --> 12:52.787
You want to see a picture?

12:52.838 --> 12:54.988
Do you <i>have</i> a picture?

12:55.040 --> 12:58.158
Got pictures of you, too.

without them,

14:42.375 --> 14:46.311
and I need to see you.

15:04.396 --> 15:06.531
Do you have any protection?

15:06.582 --> 15:10.585
Uh, no. I-I-I didn't want to
presume this was--

15:14.790 --> 15:16.925
From my last boyfriend.

15:17.009 --> 15:19.577
He was a jerk.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.413
Well,
then he didn't deserve you.

15:22.465 --> 15:24.849
You deserve...

15:24.917 --> 15:26.184
A prince.

15:28.854 --> 15:34.025
I've been waiting
for you, Clark.

15:40.616 --> 15:42.767
That was wonderful, Martha.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.068
Oh, ditto.

15:44.136 --> 15:48.706
It's nice
to feel close to someone.

15:48.774 --> 15:50.341
It's been awhile.

15:50.376 --> 15:53.745
Mm.

15:53.796 --> 15:55.580
I really needed this.

15:55.648 --> 16:00.118
Me too, Clark.

16:00.186 --> 16:01.653
I've been so stressed lately.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.421
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

16:03.489 --> 16:07.258
I just...

16:07.326 --> 16:09.227
- What's wrong?
- Mm.

16:09.295 --> 16:13.231
It's just work things.
And <i>you</i> are right.

16:13.299 --> 16:15.166
We should
talk about other things.

16:15.234 --> 16:18.987
No. You know what?
Go ahead.

16:19.071 --> 16:23.241
That's what I'm here for.

16:23.309 --> 16:27.645
Well, the department's
gotten very competitive.

16:27.713 --> 16:30.281
Our new boss
was in the Marines.

16:30.349 --> 16:33.184
So, if you don't deliver,
you are out.

16:33.252 --> 16:34.986
That's awful.

16:35.054 --> 16:37.989
I think I'm okay,
but I-I get worried sometimes.

16:38.057 --> 16:39.991
And right now, with
this attempted assassination--

16:40.059 --> 16:42.594
this scientist--
do you know about that?

16:42.661 --> 16:44.596
Of course.

16:44.663 --> 16:45.964
So none of the agencies

16:46.031 --> 16:48.099
are working together
to share the information.

16:48.167 --> 16:50.869
Each one wants to be a hero,
so nothing is getting solved.

16:50.936 --> 16:54.105
And our boss is blaming us,
'cause we're oversight.

16:54.173 --> 16:56.708
But it's like--
I'm sorry.

16:56.775 --> 16:59.344
Do <i>we</i> have
any control over the divisions?

16:59.411 --> 17:01.613
And now he's saying if we don't
come up with something,

17:01.680 --> 17:02.981
he's gonna bring in a new team.

17:03.048 --> 17:05.782
- He can't do that.
- He's done it before.

17:05.851 --> 17:08.152
But the crazy thing is, Martha,

17:08.220 --> 17:10.821
all of the information
is out there.

17:10.890 --> 17:13.290
It just needs to
be put together.

17:13.358 --> 17:17.127
And people like--
sorry, no offense--

17:17.195 --> 17:19.964
your boss, who I actually think
is a good guy,

17:20.031 --> 17:22.666
they're afraid of what
might happen to their careers

17:22.734 --> 17:26.069
if they don't play
the same game everyone else is.

17:26.137 --> 17:29.307
Anyway...

17:29.375 --> 17:31.809
Well, is there
anything I can do to help?

17:34.280 --> 17:36.714
Just getting it off my chest
has been a help.

17:36.782 --> 17:38.917
That's sweet.

17:38.984 --> 17:42.820
But you know I could get
anything that Agent Gaad has.

17:45.090 --> 17:49.661
If you could solve this thing,
maybe you'd be the hero.

17:49.728 --> 17:55.433
Maybe even get a promotion.
Show that Marine who's boss.

18:14.637 --> 18:16.688
Yes, I like.

18:16.755 --> 18:19.557
They thought we should have
a regular place to meet.

18:19.625 --> 18:20.959
Somewhere secure.

18:21.026 --> 18:23.278
Is that what you told them?

18:23.362 --> 18:26.197
A place
to "debrief" your agent?

18:26.264 --> 18:29.784
It's true.
It was their idea, actually.

18:31.620 --> 18:35.406
The other day...
I was drunk

18:35.474 --> 18:39.610
and... you were upset.

18:39.662 --> 18:41.579
Whatever happened...

18:41.647 --> 18:45.049
I am the one who kissed you,
remember?

18:48.153 --> 18:51.556
I do.

19:14.246 --> 19:17.615
Thank you for getting
a place for us to meet.

19:17.683 --> 19:21.819
- It's safer for me.
- Good.

19:21.887 --> 19:25.023
Things are tense at work.

19:25.090 --> 19:26.691
Arkady is worried.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.693
About what?

19:28.761 --> 19:30.495
Something.
I don't know.

19:30.562 --> 19:34.098
For two days now,
he's very serious.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.700
Has there been
extra cable traffic

19:35.768 --> 19:37.201
back and forth to Moscow?

19:37.269 --> 19:38.670
No.

19:38.737 --> 19:41.873
Anything unusual
in the diplomatic pouches?

19:41.940 --> 19:44.308
Not that I see.

19:44.376 --> 19:47.945
Have arkady or anybody
been going out for meetings?

19:48.013 --> 19:51.349
Not more than before.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.451
Hmm.

19:53.518 --> 19:55.853
You are worried.

19:55.921 --> 19:58.189
Like Arkady.

19:58.257 --> 20:01.859
Is something going on?

20:05.030 --> 20:07.965
I don't think I should have
gotten you into this.

20:08.033 --> 20:10.168
So now guilt?

20:10.219 --> 20:12.553
I had a job to do, Nina.

20:12.638 --> 20:16.374
Just think how you will feel
looking at me dead one day.

20:16.442 --> 20:18.009
No.

20:18.077 --> 20:20.378
That's--
we can get you out, Nina.

20:20.446 --> 20:22.680
I wasn't bullshitting
about that.

20:22.748 --> 20:26.084
It takes some time,

20:26.151 --> 20:29.187
and they have to feel
like they've gotten enough

20:29.254 --> 20:30.621
to make it worth it.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.699
I do everything for you.

20:41.767 --> 20:44.168
I am trying my best.

20:46.405 --> 20:49.006
That's not...

20:51.310 --> 20:53.244
You're not here because...

20:53.312 --> 20:57.148
I am here because
this is where I want to be.

21:12.431 --> 21:15.032
Would you care for a drink?

21:17.770 --> 21:19.303
You buying?

21:19.371 --> 21:22.206
I am.

21:28.781 --> 21:30.915
So, what's your thing?

21:30.983 --> 21:33.918
My thing?

21:33.986 --> 21:38.623
Oral? Anal?
Ecclesiastical?

21:38.690 --> 21:42.627
Oh.

21:42.694 --> 21:46.564
I am much kinkier than that.

21:46.632 --> 21:49.934
I'm really glad you guys
were able to make it.

21:50.002 --> 21:52.436
And this is truly fantastic.
What is the secret?

21:52.504 --> 21:54.839
Horseradish. Right?

21:54.907 --> 21:56.574
Oh, you cook, Phil?

21:56.642 --> 21:58.976
- He watches.
- Ah.

21:59.044 --> 22:00.578
I can relate to that.

22:00.646 --> 22:03.347
Well, it's got
a real nice kick to it.

22:03.415 --> 22:05.416
- Good. - You don't usually
like things too spicy, Stan.

22:05.484 --> 22:06.651
I don't.

22:06.718 --> 22:09.887
But I guess I do.

22:09.922 --> 22:11.255
You want some more
Brussels sprouts, Paige?

22:11.323 --> 22:13.491
- No, thanks.
- How about you, Henry?

22:13.559 --> 22:15.359
No thanks.
I already had some.

22:15.427 --> 22:16.928
I bet you want some more of
those mashed potatoes, though.

22:16.995 --> 22:19.197
- They're kind of cheesy.
- Henry.

22:19.264 --> 22:21.699
No, I-I meant cheesy,
not cheesy.

22:21.767 --> 22:23.367
No, it's fine.

22:23.402 --> 22:24.802
Well, it's not fine
to be impolite.

22:24.870 --> 22:27.171
I didn't mean to be rude.
I'm really sorry.

22:27.239 --> 22:28.673
It's just that
you're so good at it.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.007
Shut up!

22:30.075 --> 22:31.609
Guys.

22:31.677 --> 22:33.611
- Is everyone ready for dessert?
- I think so.

22:33.679 --> 22:34.779
Paige,
why don't you help clear?

22:34.847 --> 22:36.013
No, it's okay.
I got it.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.199
Finished?

22:39.518 --> 22:40.952
- What do you think?
- I-I don't know.

22:41.019 --> 22:43.287
I was just asking.
I didn't know if you--

22:43.355 --> 22:45.790
- No, I'm done.
- Okay.

22:45.857 --> 22:46.991
Oh, excuse me.

22:47.042 --> 22:48.693
No, Stan, we have guests.

22:48.727 --> 22:50.828
I have a thing going at work
I got to deal with.

22:50.896 --> 22:53.898
Sure.
Is everything okay?

22:53.966 --> 22:56.167
I'm gonna help clear.

22:56.218 --> 22:59.170
- Daddy?
- Thanks, honey.

22:59.238 --> 23:02.406
Beeman.

23:02.474 --> 23:04.208
Yeah.

23:05.944 --> 23:09.881
Well, how many more files
did you guys get through?

23:09.948 --> 23:12.883
Okay, well,
I'll be back in an hour, tops.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.418
Want me to bring leftovers?

23:28.901 --> 23:32.670
So, what's up?

23:32.738 --> 23:38.509
I was thinking about...
when we first met.

23:38.577 --> 23:40.711
Really?

23:40.779 --> 23:44.715
Do you remember that?

23:44.783 --> 23:48.185
Of course I remember.

23:57.362 --> 24:00.698
I was surprised
how pretty you were.

24:00.766 --> 24:03.234
Surprised?

24:04.937 --> 24:09.040
I-I wasn't surprised.
I was relieved, I guess.

24:16.181 --> 24:20.284
Grannie said
you slept with Irina.

24:23.555 --> 24:27.325
I asked you--

24:27.392 --> 24:30.328
I asked you not to lie to me.

24:30.395 --> 24:34.832
And you told me to my face
that nothing happened.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.144
I'm sorry.

24:47.212 --> 24:51.782
I am so sorry.

24:51.850 --> 24:55.486
I didn't know
what to say because--

24:55.554 --> 24:58.990
because I didn't
want to lose you.

25:03.862 --> 25:05.696
I love you.

25:09.201 --> 25:12.336
Hmm.

25:12.404 --> 25:15.873
Love? Hmm.

25:15.941 --> 25:22.113
I made a terrible mistake--
a terrible mistake.

25:22.180 --> 25:26.584
And so many things
have gone wrong for us.

25:28.186 --> 25:34.125
Can we please just...
try and start over?

25:34.192 --> 25:36.527
No. We can't.

25:36.595 --> 25:39.363
We can do our jobs.

25:39.431 --> 25:40.965
We can
fulfill our mission--

25:41.033 --> 25:43.567
the reason we were brought
together and sent to America.

25:43.635 --> 25:47.405
But we cannot do <i>this.</i>

25:47.472 --> 25:52.209
We will never do <i>this.</i>

26:06.990 --> 26:08.524
Please, honey, please.

26:08.575 --> 26:10.610
Oh, my God.

26:13.563 --> 26:16.198
That's it.
Come on, baby, yeah.

26:16.250 --> 26:18.901
Wait, wait, wait.

26:22.422 --> 26:24.924
Oh, God.

26:31.848 --> 26:33.849
Let's keep it going
in the shower.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.388
- You like that?
- Yeah!

27:47.424 --> 27:51.360
Martha, just secure that,
and then you're done.

27:51.428 --> 27:52.995
Thanks for taking
the split shift again.

27:53.063 --> 27:54.730
Of course. It's a crisis.

28:38.909 --> 28:40.242
Martha.

28:40.310 --> 28:42.078
- Oh! What?
- What?

28:42.145 --> 28:43.312
You just--
you startled me.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.014
I'm-- I'm sorry, baby.

28:45.082 --> 28:47.850
I'm not your baby.
So don't call me that, okay?

28:47.918 --> 28:49.251
Sorry.

28:49.319 --> 28:51.387
It's just that, um...

28:51.455 --> 28:56.592
you have been
looking very nice lately.

28:56.660 --> 28:58.227
And I just
wanted to tell you that.

28:58.295 --> 28:59.562
That's all.

28:59.629 --> 29:02.765
Well, okay.

29:02.833 --> 29:07.203
And I've missed you,
you know, since we broke up.

29:07.270 --> 29:08.838
We didn't break up, Chris.

29:08.905 --> 29:11.540
You're right.

29:11.608 --> 29:16.011
Look, I'm just the way I am,
you know?

29:17.814 --> 29:21.016
And you got to
just accept people, right?

29:22.986 --> 29:28.557
Maybe, um...
we can get a drink sometime?

29:28.625 --> 29:31.393
No, thank you.

29:31.461 --> 29:33.729
"No, thank you"?

29:33.797 --> 29:36.132
That's a very polite no.

29:36.199 --> 29:38.567
Are sure you don't want to
make it an impolite "yes"?

29:38.635 --> 29:40.202
I am.

29:40.270 --> 29:43.606
You know,
you're a sweet guy, Chris.

29:43.673 --> 29:46.041
And you're handsome.

29:46.109 --> 29:48.043
Deep down.

29:48.111 --> 29:50.880
Good night.

29:50.947 --> 29:52.948
Good night.

that was distracting me.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.759
Okay.

32:39.349 --> 32:41.283
You're a very kind person,
Martha.

32:41.351 --> 32:43.385
Okay.

32:47.524 --> 32:49.558
That's all
suspicious foreign nationals

32:49.609 --> 32:52.561
who've come through East Coast
Immigration in the past week,

32:52.629 --> 32:55.097
correlated with
where they're staying here--

32:55.148 --> 32:57.933
hotels, with relatives,
it's all there.

32:58.001 --> 32:59.869
This is just what I needed,
Martha.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.804
That's great, honey.

33:43.346 --> 33:46.282
Yeah.

33:46.349 --> 33:49.168
<i>I'm gonna count to five.</i>
<i>One...</i>

33:49.252 --> 33:51.086
<i>Please, señor!</i>

33:51.154 --> 33:52.671
<i>Two...</i>

33:52.756 --> 33:54.056
<i>Three...</i>

34:32.629 --> 34:36.998
You're not here to shoot me,
I suppose,

34:37.067 --> 34:38.967
or else
I would already be shot.

34:41.036 --> 34:42.638
So, who sent you?

34:42.706 --> 34:44.974
The same people who sent you.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.742
And what are you doing here?

34:46.810 --> 34:48.476
Your orders have been revoked.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.379
We're here
to make sure you comply.

34:50.447 --> 34:53.849
I don't know you.

34:53.917 --> 34:57.253
You were hired by the KGB.
They've changed their mind.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.889
We don't want to kill someone
our own people hired.

34:59.956 --> 35:01.757
But that's the other option.

35:13.670 --> 35:15.638
Take a look on the back.

35:21.311 --> 35:23.545
Directed charge.

35:23.613 --> 35:25.798
Surprisingly quiet.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.518
I like to think ahead.

35:29.585 --> 35:32.354
Now, the two of you
are going to put your guns down

35:32.422 --> 35:33.455
on the count of three.

35:33.523 --> 35:34.957
One...

35:36.693 --> 35:38.460
two...

35:44.434 --> 35:46.101
Ohh! Ugh!

36:44.370 --> 36:47.274
We can get past this.
It doesn't have to be like this.

36:47.342 --> 36:49.076
It <i>is</i> like this.

36:50.544 --> 36:54.714
We didn't take a vow
to be unhappy.

37:01.555 --> 37:03.390
Hey.

37:16.304 --> 37:19.672
Before you worked
for Counterintelligence, Stan,

37:19.740 --> 37:21.241
what did you do?

37:21.309 --> 37:23.510
Different things.

37:23.544 --> 37:26.679
Drugs? Robbers?

37:26.747 --> 37:30.384
Some of that.

37:30.451 --> 37:34.821
FBI. You are cops.

37:34.889 --> 37:37.057
Policemen in your hearts.

37:37.125 --> 37:40.093
Yes?

37:40.161 --> 37:42.529
Hmm.

37:42.596 --> 37:46.900
Sometimes I wonder
if you understand spies.

37:46.967 --> 37:49.903
I think
I understand pretty well.

37:49.970 --> 37:52.572
What do you want with us?

37:52.640 --> 37:55.409
One day, with Arkady,

37:55.476 --> 37:58.412
and the others
at the Rezidentura--

37:58.479 --> 38:00.247
do you want
to put them in jail?

38:00.314 --> 38:06.686
That's how policeman thinks,
not how spies think.

38:06.754 --> 38:11.091
We want everyone to stay.
Right where they are.

38:11.159 --> 38:16.296
And bleed everything they know
out of them.

38:16.364 --> 38:18.298
Forever.

38:18.366 --> 38:22.369
Today, Arkady called me
into his office.

38:22.437 --> 38:24.771
Asked questions.
I thought, "this is the end.

38:24.838 --> 38:29.976
They're going to send me to
Moscow for trials, execution."

38:30.044 --> 38:34.548
Hmm. Instead,
it was for promotion.

38:34.615 --> 38:38.151
I report to Arkady now.

38:38.219 --> 38:41.988
Maybe I will see
the Directorate "S" files.

38:42.056 --> 38:43.957
Find your illegals for you.

38:44.024 --> 38:47.561
So, you'd go into those files
for us?

38:47.628 --> 38:49.762
This is how it is.

38:49.830 --> 38:53.266
Your boss will not let me out
if I do not.

38:53.334 --> 38:56.603
You didn't have to
tell me that.

38:56.670 --> 39:01.441
I cannot lie to everyone.

39:01.509 --> 39:03.810
Too dangerous.

39:15.089 --> 39:17.257
Milbank, you're late.

39:17.325 --> 39:19.259
15 minutes. Big deal.

39:19.327 --> 39:21.861
Shift starts
when the shift starts.

39:21.929 --> 39:24.697
- My wife's gonna kill me.
- Sorry.

39:24.765 --> 39:26.166
How's the scientist doing?

39:26.234 --> 39:27.601
He spent the last
three hours explaining

39:27.668 --> 39:30.437
the difference between
particles and waves to me.

39:30.505 --> 39:35.575
You're in for a real treat.
Tell Billings I'm in the car.

39:44.685 --> 39:46.819
Come on.

39:46.887 --> 39:48.522
Whoa!

40:17.485 --> 40:19.519
I got to call you back.

40:21.172 --> 40:23.256
Leon Billings was inside, too.

40:25.259 --> 40:27.894
He didn't survive, either.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.199
They're gonna pay for this.

40:32.266 --> 40:35.268
I swear to God, they'll pay.

40:35.336 --> 40:38.938
I worked with Tom
six years in CID.

40:38.972 --> 40:42.342
Three girls, great dad.

40:42.410 --> 40:44.411
I want to know
what's gonna happen.

40:44.478 --> 40:48.748
We've got planes and tanks.
Is someone gonna use them?

40:48.816 --> 40:50.584
I think that's the whole point.

40:50.651 --> 40:51.884
What's the point?

40:51.952 --> 40:53.620
Nobody wants to use them.

40:53.688 --> 40:57.691
Even if
we could prove it was KGB,

40:57.758 --> 41:01.261
we wouldn't
start a war over this.

41:01.329 --> 41:04.231
What are you saying, sir?
We act like nothing happened?

41:04.298 --> 41:07.234
Let's wait till tomorrow.

41:07.301 --> 41:12.439
This administration
is not going to let this happen.

41:12.506 --> 41:15.275
This will--

41:15.343 --> 41:17.877
This will not stand.

41:25.185 --> 41:32.125
<i>8, 9, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 6...</i>

41:32.192 --> 41:38.898
<i>3, 5, 1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9.</i>

41:44.305 --> 41:46.273
He got one of the scientists.

41:46.340 --> 41:48.675
How?

41:48.743 --> 41:50.243
I don't know.

41:50.311 --> 41:53.846
And three FBI agents.

41:53.914 --> 41:57.517
God damn it.

41:57.585 --> 41:59.185
The Centre wants to know
what happened.

41:59.253 --> 42:01.421
What happened?

42:01.489 --> 42:04.023
We got a shit mission
with lousy information,

42:04.091 --> 42:05.659
and we still found him
and stopped him.

42:05.726 --> 42:08.495
No, we didn't stop him
in time, Philip.

42:08.562 --> 42:11.130
Do you know
where this goes now?

42:11.198 --> 42:13.966
This is our worst failure
in 15 years.

42:14.034 --> 42:17.170
Ours? Ours?

42:17.237 --> 42:19.606
They hired a killer,
then changed their mind.

42:19.674 --> 42:22.609
It's not them.
This is our job, Philip.

42:22.677 --> 42:25.645
The Americans
will assume it's us.

42:25.713 --> 42:27.781
It was our job to stop him!

42:31.051 --> 42:32.619
Zhukov was right.

42:32.687 --> 42:35.555
We can't do our jobs
if we're emotional.

42:35.623 --> 42:40.193
What happened tonight
has nothing to do with emotion.

42:40.260 --> 42:44.063
It did for me.

42:44.097 --> 42:46.132
My head was somewhere else.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.167
Where?

42:48.235 --> 42:51.438
Us.

42:53.874 --> 42:58.411
Philip, we have to stop this.

42:58.479 --> 43:00.046
We were never married.

43:00.113 --> 43:02.882
We had an arrangement,
and it worked.

43:09.457 --> 43:11.658
I tried.

43:14.762 --> 43:17.697
The first time we met,

43:17.765 --> 43:22.502
I saw you were disappointed,
like now, in your eyes.

43:25.484 --> 43:27.574
I could see you were
hoping for someone else.

43:27.641 --> 43:30.209
That I would be...

43:33.113 --> 43:35.314
someone else.

43:37.585 --> 43:39.719
I swear,
if I could change things--

43:39.787 --> 43:42.922
You can't. We can't.

43:42.990 --> 43:46.593
It is what it is.

43:58.939 --> 44:02.709
When we first came here
all those years ago,

44:02.777 --> 44:08.314
we <i>had</i> to be married for this--
to fit in, for our cover.

44:08.382 --> 44:12.318
But things are different now.
It's a very modern country.

44:12.386 --> 44:16.155
People get separated
all the time.

44:16.223 --> 44:19.592
You don't
want to be married to me?

44:19.660 --> 44:23.062
I don't think the Centre
would even care.

44:36.376 --> 44:38.377
- Good night, Martha.
- Sir.

44:40.213 --> 44:41.614
