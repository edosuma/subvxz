02:29.616 --> 02:31.823
You know how you
get rid of crabs?

02:31.951 --> 02:36.058
- How?
- You got to shave one testicle.

02:36.189 --> 02:40.569
All the crabs go over
to the other testicle,

02:40.693 --> 02:43.299
you got to light the hair
on fire on that one.

02:43.429 --> 02:46.309
When they all go scurrying out, you take
an ice pick and you fucking stab

02:46.399 --> 02:48.319
- every single last one of them.

03:59.539 --> 04:02.383
<i>The Allied
armed forces have been ordered to</i>

04:02.508 --> 04:05.114
<i>suspend offensive action.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:07.657
<i>The proclamation of V-J Day</i>

04:07.780 --> 04:10.226
<i>must await upon
the formal signing</i>

04:10.350 --> 04:12.557
<i>of the surrender terms by Japan.</i>

04:12.685 --> 04:15.393
<i>The Japanese
delegation lines up on the opposite side</i>

04:15.521 --> 04:17.728
<i>of the surrender table
from the Alliance.</i>

04:17.857 --> 04:21.303
<i>A war which had entered its
eighth terrible year in China,</i>

04:21.427 --> 04:25.273
<i>which had raged for three years and
nine months for America and Britain,</i>

04:25.398 --> 04:29.005
<i>which was the brutal, costly,
eastern half of the most horrible</i>

04:29.135 --> 04:31.240
<i>worldwide war in human history,</i>

04:31.371 --> 04:34.682
<i>is now within minutes
of ending for good.</i>

04:34.807 --> 04:36.809
<i>General MacArthur speaks.</i>

04:38.444 --> 04:41.618
<i>Let us pray that peace</i>

04:41.748 --> 04:45.127
<i>be now restored to the world,</i>

04:45.251 --> 04:50.929
<i>and that God will
preserve it always.</i>

04:51.057 --> 04:56.598
<i>- These proceedings are closed.</i>

04:56.729 --> 04:59.005
<i>Swarms of
United States aircraft</i>

04:59.132 --> 05:02.636
<i>fly in formation overhead
as the ceremony ends.</i>

05:02.769 --> 05:05.807
<i>The final United Nations
victory has been won.</i>

05:05.938 --> 05:09.579
<i>The war is over, peace is here.</i>

05:27.360 --> 05:29.067
Move it in.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.368
Move it in.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.842
Next table, next table.

05:34.967 --> 05:39.575
Move it in. Move it in.
Move it in.

05:39.706 --> 05:42.380
You men are blessed

05:42.508 --> 05:45.512
with the rejuvenating
powers of youth.

05:45.645 --> 05:49.218
The responsibilities of peacetime
must now be considered.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.057
You can start a business:

05:52.185 --> 05:55.894
filling station,
grocery or hardware store.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.662
Get a few acres of land
and raise some chickens...

05:59.392 --> 06:01.201
...go back to school.

06:01.894 --> 06:04.397
Undoubtedly, there will be
people on the outside

06:04.530 --> 06:07.101
who will not understand
the condition you men have,

06:07.233 --> 06:09.873
or will think it
a rather shameful condition.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.563
If the average civilian
had been through

06:11.671 --> 06:13.207
the same stresses that
you have been through,

06:13.339 --> 06:17.082
undoubtedly they too would have
developed the same nervous conditions.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.554
Freddie, I'm going to show you
a series of pictures.

06:19.679 --> 06:23.024
I want you to tell me the first
thing that comes to your mind.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.720
There's no right or wrong answers.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.561
Tell me what you see.

06:29.689 --> 06:33.227
Well, that's a pussy,
a lady's pussy.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.402
What about this one?

06:38.097 --> 06:40.600
Looks like cock
going inside of a pussy.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.282
All right, let's try it again.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.078
Tell me what you see, Freddie.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.617
That looks like...

06:49.742 --> 06:52.279
That's just like a cock,
actually, upside down.

06:57.016 --> 06:58.586
Thank you.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.084
<i>You've had episodes
of enuresis?</i>

07:27.814 --> 07:30.488
Yes, that's right.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.755
My kidneys were all tore up
from it all over there,

07:32.885 --> 07:34.956
and it came on strong.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.869
And what's this about
a crying episode?

07:39.992 --> 07:41.801
What crying episode?

07:41.928 --> 07:45.273
It says here you had a severe headache,
and a crying spell.

07:45.398 --> 07:48.379
I didn't have a crying spell.

07:48.501 --> 07:52.278
It was brought on by a letter
I received from a girl I knew once.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.510
I think I...

07:54.640 --> 07:57.143
I believe I suffered what,
in your profession,

07:57.276 --> 08:00.655
you call nostalgia.

08:00.780 --> 08:04.489
It was nostalgia that was
brought on by a letter I received.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.029
From your sweetheart?

08:09.755 --> 08:12.099
No, sir, not my sweetheart.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.367
The kid sister of a girl...

08:16.496 --> 08:19.705
The kid sister of a friend of mine
I knew from back home.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.142
I received this letter, and...

08:30.710 --> 08:33.020
I received a letter and I read it.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.192
According to the history here,
I notice that you say

08:38.317 --> 08:42.527
- you saw a vision of your mother.
- Now, it wasn't a vision.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.931
- It was a dream.
- Well, tell me about the dream.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.468
Why?

08:46.592 --> 08:49.471
- I need to know.
- Why do you need to know?

08:51.297 --> 08:53.504
This will help in your treatment.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.045
You can't help in my treatment,
you don't even know...

08:57.803 --> 09:00.682
Well, it was my mother
and my father and me...

09:02.041 --> 09:03.520
...back home.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.254
We were sitting around a table...

09:12.652 --> 09:14.097
...having drinks.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.329
Laughing-

09:19.191 --> 09:21.398
And it just sort of ended there.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.372
Thanks for the help.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.982
Now, you have such pretty eyes,

09:37.109 --> 09:39.715
I want the light to catch it.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.756
Look more this way.

09:41.881 --> 09:44.555
Chin up a little. OK.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.854
And just look at me.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.927
And smile.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.297
- Beautiful.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.063
Ready?

09:54.193 --> 09:56.230
Well, give a good smile.

10:02.168 --> 10:06.446
Three, two, one.

10:06.572 --> 10:07.676
Beautiful.

10:23.489 --> 10:27.494
Only $49.99. Handmade.

10:37.203 --> 10:40.980
Handmade imported mink.
Only $49.99.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.806
Forty-nine, ninety-nine.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.232
Only $49.99.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.365
- You have a break coming?
- I hope so.

11:38.497 --> 11:41.671
- When?
- Ten minutes.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.312
- Ugh.

12:25.444 --> 12:28.721
- Oh...
- Taste good?

12:38.591 --> 12:42.630
I have an apricot belly,
want to see?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.537
Yes.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.318
I'm really a very good girl.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.923
Where do you get
this idea about me?

13:00.045 --> 13:02.924
Maybe we think the same
things at the same time.

13:03.048 --> 13:08.623
Oh, my goodness.
I think we do.

13:11.157 --> 13:14.297
What else do you
want to see, these?

13:14.426 --> 13:15.905
Yes.

13:22.768 --> 13:26.375
- Are they nice?
- Yes.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.384
- Handmade.
- Yes, they are.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.988
- That's enough now.
- Oh...

13:34.313 --> 13:36.293
Want to go out tonight?

13:37.283 --> 13:38.956
Yeah, sure.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.180
- Are you married?
- Uh, yes.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.177
- This for your wife?
- Pardon me?

14:03.309 --> 14:05.414
- This for your wife?
- Uh, yes.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.889
Don't move. Just stay still.

14:59.565 --> 15:03.069
It's a little warm.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.183
It's hot.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.448
I'm starting to sweat.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.960
You need to shut up.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.086
You need to move the God...

15:21.220 --> 15:23.029
You need to shut up.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.301
You need to back off.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.927
Sit down.
I'm very sorry.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.630
I'm trying to get
the lighting right.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.868
You must understand,
I want to get the lighting right.

16:45.037 --> 16:46.345
Oh.

16:52.611 --> 16:54.955
- That's enough.
- Little bit.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.570
Drink that.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.539
One gulp.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.443
- What's your name?
- Frank.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.315
Frank.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.025
You look like my father.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.534
Need some water.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.276
We need to give him some water.

17:51.403 --> 17:55.215
- I didn't put anything in his drink.
- Did you give him poison?

17:55.340 --> 17:58.787
- No, everybody had the same thing.
- No, you're lying.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.755
- I didn't lie, he's dehydrated.
- No, you poisoned him.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.156
- No, I didn't poison him.
- No, you poisoned him.

18:04.283 --> 18:08.459
- No. He took it, he took it himself.
- No. You poisoned him.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.090
No, he needs some water.

18:11.223 --> 18:14.136
- Move, move.
- No, no, you poisoned him.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.796
- He needs some water.
- You poisoned him, you poisoned him.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.966
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I didn't poison him.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.272
I didn't do anything.
Please take your hands off me.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.280
- I didn't poison him.
- You poisoned him.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.515
I didn't do anything wrong, OK?

18:31.643 --> 18:33.919
He took the drink himself,
he took it.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.525
I didn't do anything.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.431
Good morning.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.199
Are you all right?

21:32.324 --> 21:34.668
Who are you?
Where am I?

21:34.793 --> 21:37.637
You're safe, you're at sea.

21:39.164 --> 21:43.078
Here. Come with me.

21:50.509 --> 21:52.147
Come on.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.106
Here.

22:24.376 --> 22:25.787
All right.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.824
All right.

22:32.217 --> 22:34.060
Is this your ship?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.359
I am its commander, yes.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.863
Where is it going?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.568
New York City,
through the canal.

22:45.797 --> 22:47.333
You're a seaman.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.638
Yeah. How did I get down here?

22:55.574 --> 22:58.885
You were acting aggressive
because you drank too much alcohol.

23:05.350 --> 23:07.261
No, I don't think so.

23:09.654 --> 23:13.534
You told me you were an able-bodied
seaman, and you were looking for work.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.835
I told you?

23:20.031 --> 23:21.908
Yeah, well, you have any?

23:23.201 --> 23:25.613
Why all the skulking
and sneaking?

23:26.938 --> 23:29.384
Work cannot be that
difficult to come by.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.785
That depends on when
you're ready to go.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.057
- You shouldn't work in your condition.
- No, I can work.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.633
- You're aberrated.
- No, I'm not.

23:46.525 --> 23:49.734
- Know what that means?
- No.

23:52.497 --> 23:55.137
You've wandered from
the proper path, haven't you?

23:55.801 --> 23:59.681
- These problems you have...

23:59.805 --> 24:02.006
I don't have any problems.
I don't know what I told you,

24:02.040 --> 24:05.249
but if you have work for me to do,
I can do it.

24:10.081 --> 24:12.493
You seem so familiar to me.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.494
Yeah.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.632
What do you do?

24:23.895 --> 24:27.638
I do many, many things.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.871
I am a writer, a doctor,

24:30.001 --> 24:32.982
a nuclear physicist,
a theoretical philosopher...

24:34.673 --> 24:37.244
...but above all I am a man.

24:38.743 --> 24:41.690
A hopelessly inquisitive man,
just like you.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.795
Well, I'm sorry if I got
out of hand last night.

24:52.924 --> 24:56.133
- It was cold and I was...
- Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel.

24:58.930 --> 25:01.206
And as a scientist
and a connoisseur, I have...

25:01.333 --> 25:05.543
...I have no idea the contents
of this remarkable potion.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.876
What's in it?

25:10.208 --> 25:11.881
Secrets.

25:14.145 --> 25:15.886
Can you make more?

25:17.682 --> 25:19.184
Well, not like that.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.729
But I can make you
something different, better.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.560
I'll make something
special for you.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.224
How do you like to feel?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.772
I will give you a full reprieve
from your naughtiness

25:30.896 --> 25:33.604
as a stowaway,
if you make us some more.

25:33.732 --> 25:37.680
I must admit I, I sampled it
and ended up drinking it all.

25:42.307 --> 25:45.618
Would you scrub yourself
and make yourself clean.

25:45.744 --> 25:48.224
My daughter is getting married.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.587
Come and join us.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.456
Leave your worries for a while.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.825
They'll still be there
when you get back.

25:56.421 --> 25:58.560
And your memories aren't invited.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.707
Stand wherever you like.

26:48.573 --> 26:51.281
Good day, good day,
good day, good day.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.116
What a day. What a day.

26:53.244 --> 26:54.621
Mama.

26:56.147 --> 26:57.285
Rascal.

26:57.415 --> 26:59.622
Clark, big day?

26:59.751 --> 27:01.662
- Big day indeed, sir.
- How are you feeling?

27:01.786 --> 27:04.027
I feel pretty well, thank you.
How are you?

27:04.155 --> 27:05.964
Wonderful.

27:06.091 --> 27:09.664
As long as you hold these bodies,

27:09.794 --> 27:14.743
in this life,
you will be man and wife.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.312
You may kiss the bride.

27:47.532 --> 27:49.375
Marriage!

27:50.769 --> 27:53.750
Previous to The Cause
was awful.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.588
Awful.

28:01.713 --> 28:04.592
It was a cycle, like life.

28:04.716 --> 28:09.358
Birth, excitement,
growth, decay, death.

28:11.389 --> 28:15.667
Now... now...

28:15.794 --> 28:17.205
...how about this?

28:18.997 --> 28:22.843
Here it comes... a large dragon.

28:23.902 --> 28:25.108
Teeth...

28:26.137 --> 28:29.812
...blood dripping, red eyes.
What do I got?

28:31.009 --> 28:34.388
A lasso. I whip it up.

28:34.512 --> 28:37.891
I wrap it around its neck,
and I wrestle,

28:38.016 --> 28:41.020
wrestle, wrestle him
to the ground.

28:41.152 --> 28:44.599
I snap up.
I say, "Sit, dragon." Dragon sits.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.226
I say "Stay." Dragon stays.

28:47.358 --> 28:49.929
- Now it's got a leash on it.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.007
I take it for a walk.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.611
And that's where
we're at with it now.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.849
It stays on command.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.611
Next we're going to teach it
to roll over and play dead.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.761
- Love that story.
- So, where are you from?

29:18.890 --> 29:20.267
- Huh?
- Where are you from?

29:20.391 --> 29:21.927
Lynn, Massachusetts.

29:22.060 --> 29:25.507
- Freddie Quell, how do you do?
- I'm Val. I'm his son.

29:25.630 --> 29:28.406
Oh, yeah, I see it.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.672
So what kind of work
will you be doing?

29:30.802 --> 29:33.612
- Not sure.
- Done any Time Hole work?

29:33.738 --> 29:36.514
- Any what?
- Any Time Hole work?

29:36.641 --> 29:38.985
I don't think so.
I don't know what that is.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.515
- I'm sure you're going to love it.
- I hope so.

29:42.647 --> 29:45.218
- Nice to meet you and welcome aboard.
- Looking forward to it.

29:47.152 --> 29:49.291
- How long have you known him?
- Good night!

29:49.420 --> 29:51.422
- About three years.
- Good night, good night, good night.

29:51.556 --> 29:53.365
Thank you, thank you
for being here.

29:53.491 --> 29:55.198
- Norman...
- Three years?

29:55.326 --> 29:56.600
Thank you.

29:56.728 --> 29:58.366
- Good night, Master.
- Good night.

29:59.764 --> 30:01.801
When can we have
some more of your potion?

30:01.933 --> 30:03.310
Whenever you like,
I'll make it.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.505
When I like it,
I'll give you a signal.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.776
I'll rub my nose
and scratch my ear.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.510
What will you need?

30:09.641 --> 30:11.951
- I'll take care of it.
- Good.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.352
- Anything you need.
- Thank you, good night.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.455
Good night, everyone.

30:18.283 --> 30:20.092
Don't get up.
Don't get up.

30:23.087 --> 30:24.191
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.268
What a day.

30:28.760 --> 30:32.640
We fought against the day
and we won. We won.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.217
Freddie, feel free to sit with us.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.512
Can you invite him over?

30:47.645 --> 30:49.283
Say, come on over.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.437
Can you say hi?

31:02.560 --> 31:05.404
<i>He's... been writing all night.</i>

31:05.530 --> 31:08.670
You seem to inspire something in him.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.177
- Yeah?
- Mm.

31:10.301 --> 31:13.043
When we're at home, on land,

31:13.171 --> 31:16.448
there's too much pulling him
in each direction.

31:16.574 --> 31:19.521
Every time he sits to write,
a new attack is launched against him,

31:19.644 --> 31:22.853
and he spends too much time
defending himself.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.722
Who's attacking him?

31:26.651 --> 31:28.562
People who are scared.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.759
People who are greedy.

31:32.857 --> 31:35.531
Ex-wives.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.270
That's what's so nice
about being at sea.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.105
- He gets his studies done.
- Hm.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.942
Advances the learning.
He writes book two.

31:48.606 --> 31:51.917
Say "back beyond" and return
to the pre-birth area.

31:52.043 --> 31:55.957
Back beyond,
back beyond, back beyond.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.122
Back beyond.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.320
- How are you feeling?
- Back beyond.

32:00.451 --> 32:04.399
Back beyond... I feel cold.

32:04.522 --> 32:07.401
- Continue, please.
- Back beyond,

32:07.525 --> 32:10.734
back beyond, back beyond.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.773
Continue, please,
and tell me what you hear.

32:12.897 --> 32:15.138
It's my mother.

32:16.968 --> 32:19.710
Recall what she says.
Recall a sound.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.843
It's her voice.

32:23.975 --> 32:26.512
She's saying,

32:26.644 --> 32:30.251
"We shouldn't be doing this,
not while she's inside me."

32:30.381 --> 32:32.588
- Repeat what she says.
- "Not while I'm pregnant."

32:32.717 --> 32:34.253
Repeat what she says.

32:34.385 --> 32:37.059
Do you understand what's happening?

32:40.058 --> 32:41.799
I'm not sure.

32:41.926 --> 32:45.339
We record everything.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.269
Really?

32:50.401 --> 32:52.813
Through all lifetimes.

33:21.165 --> 33:26.205
<i>Man is not an animal.</i>

33:26.337 --> 33:31.787
<i>We are not a pan'
of the animal kingdom.</i>

33:33.444 --> 33:36.482
<i>We sit far above that crowd.</i>

33:36.614 --> 33:41.154
<i>Perched as spirits, not beasts.</i>

33:42.020 --> 33:47.026
<i>You are not ruled by your emotions.</i>

33:47.158 --> 33:49.229
<i>It is not only possible,</i>

33:49.360 --> 33:54.833
<i>it is easily achievable
that we do away</i>

33:54.966 --> 33:59.779
<i>with all negative
emotional impulses,</i>

33:59.904 --> 34:05.320
<i>and bring man back to his
inherent state of perfect.</i>

34:08.746 --> 34:12.216
<i>Man is not an animal.</i>

34:14.385 --> 34:18.264
<i>We are not a pan'
of the animal kingdom.</i>

34:19.590 --> 34:21.831
<i>We sit far above that crowd.</i>

34:23.761 --> 34:28.801
<i>Perched as spirits, not beasts.</i>

34:28.933 --> 34:34.542
<i>You are not ruled
by your emotions.</i>

34:34.672 --> 34:40.020
<i>It is not only possible,
it is easily achievable...</i>

35:37.869 --> 35:38.870
Hm-mm.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.921
Cheers.

35:52.283 --> 35:53.489
Mm.

35:55.786 --> 35:57.857
- Oh, God!

35:57.989 --> 36:01.960
Oh, God! Oh, God!

36:02.093 --> 36:03.834
Freddie.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.699
Lovely.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.947
I've been writing.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.383
Feel like I went under.

36:16.507 --> 36:21.388
Dark cloud rolls in, opens up.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.686
Anxious to share new work.

36:24.815 --> 36:27.989
Would you care
for some informal processing?

36:28.119 --> 36:30.861
Sure. What do I have to do?

36:30.988 --> 36:33.730
- Just answer my questions, we talk.
- OK.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.065
Very good. Have a seat.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.565
How are you feeling, Freddie?

36:42.700 --> 36:44.270
Good.

36:44.402 --> 36:47.849
- You rested?
- Yes.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.713
- Excited?
- Yeah.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.911
Have you made some friends?

36:52.043 --> 36:54.353
- Everyone is very nice here.
- Good. Good.

36:54.478 --> 36:58.358
- How are you feeling?
- Yeah, good.

36:59.317 --> 37:02.389
I gather myself.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.898
You'll be my guinea pig
and protégé.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.602
Informal processing.

37:18.603 --> 37:21.049
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.212
Say your name.

37:28.379 --> 37:30.325
- Freddie Quell.
- Say it again.

37:30.448 --> 37:31.825
Freddie Quell.

37:31.949 --> 37:34.088
- Say it again.
- Freddie Quell.

37:34.218 --> 37:36.220
- Say it again.
- Freddie Quell.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.061
Might as well say it
one more time,

37:38.189 --> 37:39.566
just to make sure
you know who you are.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.670
Freddie Quell.

37:41.792 --> 37:43.601
Are you thoughtless
in your remarks?

37:45.963 --> 37:48.466
I usually put
some thought into them.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.670
Do you linger at bus stations
for pleasure?

37:50.801 --> 37:53.304
No.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.713
Do you get muscle spasms
for no reason?

37:56.474 --> 37:57.782
No.

37:59.744 --> 38:02.190
Do your past failures
bother you?

38:02.313 --> 38:03.587
No.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.694
Do your past failures
bother you?

38:05.816 --> 38:08.092
No.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.392
Do your past failures
bother you?

38:12.323 --> 38:13.301
No.

38:13.424 --> 38:16.462
Do your past failures in life
bother you?

38:18.829 --> 38:19.864
No.

38:19.997 --> 38:22.841
- Is your life a struggle?
- No.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.176
- Do you like to be told what to do?
- No.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.113
Is your behavior erratic?

38:32.143 --> 38:33.178
No.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.450
Do you find interest
in other people?

38:35.579 --> 38:37.388
Not really.

38:37.515 --> 38:41.053
- Do you find it easy to be fair?

38:41.185 --> 38:42.528
Yes.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.065
Are you often consumed by envy?

38:45.189 --> 38:47.066
No, about what?

38:47.191 --> 38:50.434
Are you often consumed by envy?

38:53.864 --> 38:56.310
I don't unders...
You mean like jealousy?

38:56.434 --> 38:59.643
- Like jealousy.
- Oh, well, yeah.

38:59.770 --> 39:03.013
I don't like someone else's hands
on my girls.

39:03.140 --> 39:06.678
I don't like to think about it.
It makes me sick.

39:06.811 --> 39:09.348
Are you scientific in your thought?

39:10.715 --> 39:12.820
Yes.

39:12.950 --> 39:15.453
Are you concerned with
the impression you make?

39:17.521 --> 39:18.659
Mm...

39:19.990 --> 39:21.663
I don't understand.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.703
Yes, you do.

39:28.299 --> 39:31.405
Well, most people are asses,
if that's what you mean.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.175
Are you usually truthful to others?

39:34.305 --> 39:37.184
No. I don't know.

39:37.308 --> 39:40.687
- Sometimes.
- Are you unpredictable?

39:52.156 --> 39:53.760
Silly.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.529
Silly animal.

39:55.659 --> 39:58.003
- I couldn't help it.
- Dirty animal.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.205
Sorry.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.541
It's good to laugh
during processing.

40:05.669 --> 40:10.118
Sometimes we forget,
even if it is the sound of an animal.

40:15.112 --> 40:19.993
Freddie Quell, test session,
March 5th, 1950, 1800 hours.

40:20.117 --> 40:23.155
Aboard the sailing vessel Alethia.

40:23.287 --> 40:25.927
LD, MOC, MD,
logged and approved.

40:26.056 --> 40:30.732
Should we sample another sip
before we join them upstairs?

40:30.861 --> 40:32.272
Wait, that's it?

40:33.798 --> 40:35.141
For now.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.110
No, no, no, no.
You got to ask me more.

40:38.235 --> 40:41.045
This is fun.
Come on, you got to ask me more.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.246
Could you answer the next series of
questions without blinking your eyes?

40:45.376 --> 40:47.788
- Yes.
- Without fear and hesitation,

40:47.912 --> 40:50.119
- answer as quickly as you can?
- Sure.

40:54.552 --> 40:57.294
- Again.

41:05.329 --> 41:08.469
Starting now,
you are not to blink.

41:08.599 --> 41:11.375
If you blink we go back
to the start.

41:11.502 --> 41:13.004
Infringement.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.378
You blinked.

41:15.506 --> 41:17.884
Starting now,
you are not to blink.

41:18.008 --> 41:20.488
If you blink,
we go back to the start.

41:20.611 --> 41:23.217
Do you often think about
how inconsequential you are?

41:23.347 --> 41:24.655
No.

41:24.782 --> 41:27.991
Do you believe that God will save you
from your own ridiculousness?

41:28.118 --> 41:29.188
No.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.760
Have you ever had intercourse
with someone inside your family?

41:31.856 --> 41:33.893
Yes.

41:34.024 --> 41:36.698
Have you ever had intercourse
with someone inside your family?

41:36.827 --> 41:37.999
- Yes.
- Who?

41:38.128 --> 41:39.835
- My auntie.
- Have you killed anyone?

41:39.964 --> 41:41.307
- No.
- Maybe?

41:41.432 --> 41:43.378
- Not me.
- Have you killed anyone?

41:43.501 --> 41:45.003
- No.
- How many times did you

41:45.135 --> 41:47.081
- have intercourse with your aunt?
- Three times.

41:47.204 --> 41:48.842
- Where is your aunt now?
- I don't know.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.247
Would you like to have
intercourse with her again?

41:50.374 --> 41:51.409
No.

41:51.542 --> 41:54.819
- Do you regret this?
- No.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.551
- Where is your mother?
- I don't know. Loony...

41:57.681 --> 41:59.183
- Infringement.
- Fuck!

42:02.486 --> 42:04.727
- Back to the start.
- OK.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.934
Do you often think about
how inconsequential you are?

42:12.062 --> 42:13.507
Yes.

42:13.631 --> 42:15.941
- Do you believe that God will save you?
- No.

42:16.066 --> 42:17.773
Have you ever had sex
with a member of your family?

42:17.902 --> 42:19.040
- Yes.
- Are you lying?

42:19.169 --> 42:21.115
- No.
- Who?

42:21.238 --> 42:23.377
- My Auntie Bertha.
- Where is your aunt now?

42:23.507 --> 42:25.282
I don't know, maybe home.

42:25.409 --> 42:27.355
- Are you lying?
- No.

42:27.478 --> 42:29.014
- Are you a liar?
- Yes.

42:29.146 --> 42:32.059
- Have you killed anyone?
- Yes.

42:32.182 --> 42:34.025
- Who?
- Japs in war.

42:34.151 --> 42:36.427
- Do you regret this?
- No.

42:36.554 --> 42:40.525
- What are you running from?
- Maybe I hurt a man, I think.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.365
Maybe he's dead.
I don't know.

42:42.493 --> 42:43.801
- Where?
- In Salinas.

42:43.928 --> 42:46.067
He stole a batch of my booze
and he drank it.

42:46.196 --> 42:48.642
- Is this booze you make poison?
- Not if you drink it smart.

42:48.766 --> 42:50.939
- Are you trying to poison me?
- No.

42:51.068 --> 42:52.979
- Where is your father?
- Dead.

42:53.103 --> 42:55.083
- How did he die?
- Drunk.

42:55.205 --> 42:56.582
Where is your mother?

43:00.711 --> 43:02.156
Where is your mother?

43:02.980 --> 43:05.153
- Loony bin.
- Is she psychotic?

43:05.282 --> 43:06.556
Yes.

43:06.684 --> 43:09.324
- What is the name of your aunt?
- Bertha.

43:09.453 --> 43:11.533
How did you come to have sex
with your Auntie Bertha?

43:11.622 --> 43:13.966
- I was drunk and she looked good.
- And you did it again and again?

43:14.091 --> 43:15.900
Yes.

43:16.026 --> 43:17.986
Have you ever had bad thoughts
about Master Peggy?

43:18.095 --> 43:19.836
- Yes.
- What did you think?

43:19.964 --> 43:22.308
- I thought you were fools.
- Am I a fool to you?

43:22.433 --> 43:24.034
- No, sir.
- If you were locked in a room

43:24.134 --> 43:25.807
for the rest of your life,
who would be in there with you?

43:25.936 --> 43:28.815
- Doris.
- Who's Doris?

43:28.939 --> 43:31.749
Best girl I ever met.
The girl I'm going to marry one day.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.354
- Is she in Lynn?
- Yes.

43:33.477 --> 43:34.979
- Lynn, Massachusetts?
- Yes, sir.

43:35.112 --> 43:37.683
- Then why aren't you with her?
- I'm an idiot.

43:37.815 --> 43:41.262
- Why aren't you with that lovely girl?
- I got no reason. I'm a fool.

43:41.385 --> 43:42.659
- Do you love Doris?
- Yes.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.322
- Is she the love of your life?
- Yes, sir.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.332
- Then why aren't you with her?
- I don't know.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.835
Yes, you do. Tell me why you're
not with her if you love her so much.

43:48.959 --> 43:50.939
I told her I'd come back,
and I never went back

43:51.061 --> 43:52.699
and now I just,
I got to get back to her.

43:52.830 --> 43:54.391
- Why don't you go back?
- I don't know.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.808
- Why don't you go back?
- I don't know!

43:55.933 --> 43:57.344
Close your eyes.

44:15.352 --> 44:16.922
<i>Recall a word.</i>

44:18.255 --> 44:20.132
<i>Flowers.</i>

44:25.429 --> 44:27.204
<i>Can you recall
what you're wearing?</i>

44:32.269 --> 44:33.942
<i>Navy blues.</i>

44:39.777 --> 44:41.450
<i>What do you hear?</i>

44:44.381 --> 44:46.327
<i>Voices inside.</i>

44:48.552 --> 44:50.463
Hello, Mrs. Solstad.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.803
What made you come and see me?

45:04.201 --> 45:05.908
I thought about you.

45:07.738 --> 45:09.809
I thought about you
when I was away.

45:10.908 --> 45:13.013
I got your letter.

45:14.978 --> 45:17.219
They have you write
to soldiers at school?

45:19.817 --> 45:21.421
I wrote to you.

45:25.589 --> 45:27.933
How come you didn't write me back?

45:28.058 --> 45:29.662
I don't know.

45:31.528 --> 45:35.499
I did.
I just... never sent it.

45:37.034 --> 45:38.809
Are you going to Briar Cliff?

45:38.936 --> 45:40.745
I'm not in college.

45:42.106 --> 45:45.815
What are you, a senior?

45:45.943 --> 45:47.820
- Junior?
- No.

45:47.945 --> 45:50.926
- You're not a freshman.
- I'm a sophomore.

45:51.048 --> 45:54.825
- So how old does that make you?
- Sixteen.

45:54.952 --> 45:57.398
- Did you think I was older?
- No.

45:58.689 --> 46:00.600
I don't really remember.

46:06.029 --> 46:10.273
- Can I kiss you?

46:24.047 --> 46:26.152
<i>Recall a sound.</i>

46:29.453 --> 46:31.057
She's singing.

47:25.375 --> 47:27.548
Her voice settles me down.

47:44.728 --> 47:46.969
I'm meant to go to Norway.

47:49.199 --> 47:52.544
- When's this?
- November.

47:55.472 --> 47:57.509
What for?

47:57.641 --> 48:00.019
I'm going to meet
the rest of our family.

48:04.681 --> 48:06.524
Well, I don't think you should go.

48:14.224 --> 48:16.204
No, you're not going to go.

48:16.326 --> 48:19.705
I came all this way to see you,
and I want you to stay here.

48:24.534 --> 48:25.911
All right.

48:28.605 --> 48:30.175
All right.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.449
Can you recall a word?

48:39.283 --> 48:40.921
Any word.

48:41.585 --> 48:43.189
Away.

48:44.855 --> 48:47.563
- Say it again.
- Away.

48:51.128 --> 48:55.474
- Who's saying "away"?
- I am.

48:59.636 --> 49:01.240
<i>Outbound for Shanghai!</i>

49:01.371 --> 49:07.083
Need one able-bodied seaman,
one oiler and one baker.

49:07.210 --> 49:08.746
The man McCoughsky.

49:10.614 --> 49:11.649
The man Quell.

49:11.782 --> 49:12.852
- Yeah.
- Oiler?

49:12.983 --> 49:14.189
- Yes, sir.
- Done this before?

49:14.318 --> 49:16.457
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow morning, 8:00.

49:20.424 --> 49:23.769
- Hey.
- Hi.

49:23.894 --> 49:26.932
Listen, I gotta go
somewhere for a few months,

49:27.064 --> 49:28.805
so you should go to Norway.

49:28.932 --> 49:31.538
- Where are you going?
- I got a job that takes me away.

49:31.668 --> 49:33.306
- Where?
- I don't know.

49:33.437 --> 49:36.384
Don't ask me so many questions.
I don't know anyway.

49:36.506 --> 49:40.955
You know, I didn't know which window
was yours, and I always guess right.

49:41.078 --> 49:43.820
You take your trip
and come back home,

49:43.947 --> 49:45.949
and that's gonna be our time, right?

49:46.083 --> 49:48.222
That's gonna be our time.
That's gonna be our time, right?

49:48.352 --> 49:49.490
- Yeah.
- Right? Say yes.

49:49.619 --> 49:51.292
- Say yes.
- Yes.

50:00.330 --> 50:01.934
I'll be back in a minute.

50:28.191 --> 50:30.569
<i>Release and return to me.</i>

50:32.162 --> 50:33.971
Open your eyes.

50:42.973 --> 50:46.079
Say your name.

50:46.209 --> 50:49.088
- Freddie Quell.
- Are you here with me in 1950?

50:49.212 --> 50:50.691
Yes.

50:51.748 --> 50:53.386
End of session.

50:59.689 --> 51:04.229
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

51:04.361 --> 51:07.740
- Left side of your body feel OK?
- Yes.

51:07.864 --> 51:11.141
- Right side of your stomach?
- Yes.

51:11.268 --> 51:14.147
- Headaches?
- A little.

51:15.172 --> 51:17.618
Are you a member of
the Hidden Rulers?

51:17.741 --> 51:20.483
- I don't know what that is.
- Any communist organization?

51:20.610 --> 51:21.588
No.

51:21.711 --> 51:24.317
Any invader force on this
planet or anywhere else?

51:24.448 --> 51:26.450
No, sir.

51:26.583 --> 51:29.120
You are the bravest boy
I've ever met.

51:46.570 --> 51:47.947
To the poison.

51:53.577 --> 51:56.581
Ah.

52:06.723 --> 52:08.066
Well done.

52:14.397 --> 52:15.842
Kools.

52:24.407 --> 52:26.011
I like Kools.

52:27.844 --> 52:29.448
Minty flavor.

52:31.081 --> 52:32.651
Bill!

52:32.782 --> 52:35.023
- Master, hello!
- Hello!

52:35.152 --> 52:36.859
Welcome.

52:36.987 --> 52:39.024
- Welcome back to New York City.
- Thank you.

52:39.156 --> 52:42.365
- We are so happy you're here.
- I'm happy I'm here.

52:42.492 --> 52:45.302
Peggy, watch your step.

52:45.428 --> 52:47.669
Watch your step, everyone.

52:47.797 --> 52:49.640
- Hello, Mildred.
- Hello.

52:49.766 --> 52:51.336
- Nice to see you.
- Hello.

52:51.468 --> 52:52.538
- Mildred.
- Oh, hello.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.205
This is Mildred Drummond.

52:54.337 --> 52:56.578
- Very nice to meet you.
- Wonderful to meet you finally.

52:56.606 --> 52:57.914
- My pleasure.
- And...

52:58.041 --> 52:59.748
The boat was perfect.

52:59.876 --> 53:02.152
- Thank you. Peggy, my wife.
- Hello, Peggy.

53:02.279 --> 53:04.259
Nice to meet you.
And congratulations.

53:04.381 --> 53:06.156
- Thank you.
- Freddie Quell.

53:06.283 --> 53:09.093
- Freddie... Quell.

53:09.219 --> 53:11.893
- Elizabeth, my daughter.
- Yes.

53:12.022 --> 53:14.024
- Hello. How are you?
- Clark, my son-in-law.

53:14.157 --> 53:16.194
- Hello, Clark.
- Lovely to meet you.

53:16.326 --> 53:17.600
- Lovely to meet you.
- Norman Conrad.

53:17.727 --> 53:18.967
- Yes.
- How do you do?

53:19.029 --> 53:20.702
- Cliff Boyd.
- Good evening.

53:20.830 --> 53:22.935
- Val, my son.
- Oh, yes.

53:23.066 --> 53:25.103
How are you?
I can see the resemblance.

53:25.235 --> 53:28.842
- Yes, yes. So can I.
- Why don't you come with me?

53:28.972 --> 53:31.714
I will introduce you to...

53:31.841 --> 53:33.582
- Oh, well, here's Poppy.
- Poppy!

53:33.710 --> 53:36.020
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Yes.

53:36.146 --> 53:37.716
- And the lovely Brigitte.
- Brigitte!

53:55.665 --> 53:58.578
- Here you are.
- Good evening. Scotch.

53:58.702 --> 54:01.615
- Scotch, OK. Neat or on the rocks?
- Neat.

54:01.738 --> 54:03.945
Neat. Two fingers?

54:04.074 --> 54:05.576
Yeah, it's fine.

54:06.876 --> 54:08.116
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.225
- Thank you, Clark. Thank you.
- Thank you.

54:10.347 --> 54:14.887
- Would you like something?
- We have some delicious treats inside.

54:15.018 --> 54:17.089
- In the back? Those sandwiches?
- In the back. Yes.

54:17.220 --> 54:20.963
- And an Old Fashioned.
- Old Fashioned for me.

54:21.091 --> 54:24.072
Do you want to stay together
or do you want to come with me?

54:24.194 --> 54:25.639
I'll join you.

54:25.762 --> 54:27.503
All right, come with me, Peggy.

54:27.631 --> 54:29.991
- Thank you so much.
- This is my friend I want you to meet,

54:30.100 --> 54:31.260
- Michelle.
- Hi. How are you?

54:58.561 --> 55:01.508
Open your eyes, come back to me.

55:06.436 --> 55:08.109
What is your name?

55:09.339 --> 55:11.114
Margaret O'Brien.

55:13.443 --> 55:15.184
What is your name?

55:21.985 --> 55:22.986
Well...

55:25.188 --> 55:27.429
Now that you mention it...

55:29.526 --> 55:32.837
...I think I was a man.

55:32.962 --> 55:34.771
Laughing is good.

55:36.199 --> 55:39.578
- My neck feels much better.
- Oh, that's good.

55:40.704 --> 55:45.744
What I just experienced,
was that me?

55:45.875 --> 55:47.752
What was you, darling?

55:47.877 --> 55:52.724
That man in the armor,
was that me?

55:52.849 --> 55:54.760
Yes. That was your spirit.

55:54.884 --> 55:58.161
Our spirits live on
in the whole of time,

55:58.288 --> 56:02.600
exist in many vessels
through time.

56:02.726 --> 56:07.232
This is the vessel
you're existing in now, in 1950.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.436
- Excuse me.
- As you all may recall,

56:10.567 --> 56:15.846
during the trauma that you went through
while we were processing...

56:15.972 --> 56:17.076
Yes.

56:17.207 --> 56:21.713
...It was of the utmost importance

56:21.845 --> 56:24.985
that you experience every detail...

56:26.216 --> 56:28.787
...every specific detail

56:28.918 --> 56:31.694
through all of your senses,
of that memory,

56:31.821 --> 56:33.391
and that we go over it again

56:33.523 --> 56:35.628
and over it again
and over it again

56:35.759 --> 56:38.365
until it loses its power.
This is very...

56:38.495 --> 56:43.205
- Excuse me.
- This is very important.

56:43.333 --> 56:45.870
- Why it is important...
- Excuse me.

56:46.002 --> 56:50.781
...Is if you bring someone
out of a traumatic event,

56:50.907 --> 56:53.080
back to the present time,

56:53.209 --> 56:56.213
- no matter how carefully you do that...
- Excuse me.

56:56.346 --> 56:57.723
...If you have not
gone over the memory...

56:57.847 --> 57:00.020
Excuse me. Excuse me.

57:01.751 --> 57:04.925
Some of this sounds
quite like hypnosis, is it not?

57:05.054 --> 57:09.002
This is a process of
de-hypnotization, if you will.

57:09.125 --> 57:12.732
Man is asleep. This process
wakes him from his slumber.

57:14.297 --> 57:16.641
I still find it difficult
to see the proof

57:16.766 --> 57:20.805
with regards to past lives
that your movement claims.

57:20.937 --> 57:23.747
Would you care to
submit yourself to processing?

57:23.873 --> 57:26.410
"Look through the telescope,"
as my friend said.

57:26.543 --> 57:28.648
Oh, perhaps another time.

57:28.778 --> 57:31.782
You've also said that these methods,
Cause Methods,

57:31.915 --> 57:34.919
can cure leukemia,
according to your book, and...

57:35.051 --> 57:38.123
Some forms of leukemia.

57:38.254 --> 57:40.291
In being able
to access past lives,

57:40.423 --> 57:43.302
we are able to treat illnesses
that may have started back

57:43.426 --> 57:45.133
thousands, even trillions of years.

57:45.261 --> 57:47.832
- Trillions?
- With a sir.

57:47.964 --> 57:51.810
The earth is not understood
to be more than a few billion years old.

57:51.935 --> 57:56.315
Even the smartest of our current
scientists can be fooled, yes.

57:56.439 --> 57:58.280
- You can understand skepticism...
- Yes!

57:58.308 --> 58:01.380
- ...can you not?
- Yes, yes.

58:01.511 --> 58:05.459
For without it, we'd be positives
and no negatives, therefore zero charge.

58:05.582 --> 58:08.529
- We must have it.
- Good science by definition

58:08.651 --> 58:10.452
allows for more than one opinion,
does it not?

58:10.487 --> 58:12.626
Which is why our gathering
of data is so far-reaching.

58:12.755 --> 58:14.596
Otherwise, you merely have
the will of one man,

58:14.657 --> 58:18.298
which is the basis of cult, is it not?

58:18.428 --> 58:20.169
'Tis, 'tis.

58:20.296 --> 58:23.140
And thankfully, we are, all of us,
working at breakneck speeds

58:23.266 --> 58:25.837
and in unison towards capturing
the mind's fatal flaws

58:25.969 --> 58:29.849
and correcting it back to
its inherent state of perfect.

58:30.306 --> 58:34.049
Whilst righting civilization
and eliminating war and poverty,

58:34.177 --> 58:36.919
and therefore, the atomic threat.

58:37.046 --> 58:40.858
Well...

58:40.984 --> 58:43.362
I find it quite difficult
to comprehend,

58:43.486 --> 58:47.525
or more to the point, believe,
that you believe, sir,

58:47.657 --> 58:50.035
that time travel hypnosis therapy

58:50.159 --> 58:52.537
can bring world peace
and cure cancer.

58:52.662 --> 58:54.471
I have never been
to the pyramids, have you?

58:55.565 --> 58:58.171
- No.
- And yet we know that they are there

58:58.301 --> 59:00.406
because learned men have told us so.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.346
May I ask, what is your name?

59:04.207 --> 59:07.279
- John More.
- Mr. More, if I may,

59:07.410 --> 59:11.222
is there something frightening to you
about The Cause's travels into the past?

59:11.347 --> 59:13.349
- Frightening? No, no.
- Yes.

59:13.483 --> 59:16.930
What scares you so much about
traveling into the past, sir?

59:17.053 --> 59:18.862
- I'm not frightened.
- Are you afraid that we might discover

59:18.988 --> 59:21.696
that our past has been reshapen?

59:22.759 --> 59:25.239
Perverted?

59:25.361 --> 59:27.705
And perhaps what we think
we know of this world

59:27.830 --> 59:31.039
- is false information?
- Time travel does not

59:31.167 --> 59:33.113
frighten me, sir,
because it's not possible.

59:33.236 --> 59:36.076
What does frighten me is the possibility
of some poor soul with leukemia

59:36.105 --> 59:37.585
- coming to you...
- There are dangers

59:37.707 --> 59:40.654
of traveling in and out of time
as we understand it.

59:40.777 --> 59:42.817
But it's not unlike traveling
down a river, you see?

59:42.879 --> 59:45.291
You travel down the river,
'round the bend, look back,

59:45.415 --> 59:47.292
and you cannot see
around the bend can you?

59:47.417 --> 59:49.624
But that does not mean
it is not there, does it?

59:49.752 --> 59:53.598
But certain clubs would like us
to think that a truth,

59:53.723 --> 59:57.136
I say truth, uncovered
should stay hidden.

59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.606
I belong to no club, and if you're
unwilling to allow any discussion...

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:05.144
No, this isn't a
discussion, it's a grilling.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:08.249
There's nothing I can do for you
if your mind has been made up.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:11.477
You seem to know the answers
to your questions. Why do you ask?

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.111
I'm sorry you're unwilling
to defend your beliefs

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:17.224
- in any kind of rational...
- If you already

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:20.658
know the answers to your questions,
then why ask, pig fuck?!

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.268
We are not helpless.

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.869
And we are on a journey
that risks the dark.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:38.312
If you don't mind,
a good night to you.

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:44.748
Freddie, stop!

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.415
This is not the time. Stop.

01:00:56.786 --> 01:01:00.632
- And this is where we are at.

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:05.638
At the lowest level to have
to explain ourselves, for what?

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:08.174
For what we do
we have to grovel?

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.408
The only way to defend ourselves
is to attack.

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:16.244
If we don't do that, we will lose
every battle that we are engaged in.

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:18.875
We will never dominate
our environment

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:21.955
the way we should
unless we attack.

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:28.089
And this city,
city is just noise.

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.094
I know this city.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:34.361
I know its rotten secrets,
its filthy lies and secrets.

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:40.398
They... invited us here
and welcomed us.

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:45.643
Only to throw us down
and kick us out.

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:49.978
It's a grim joke.

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:14.072
You got the names and information
of the people at this party, right?

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:17.371
- You invited them?
- Yeah, what for?

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:24.411
All right, Clark.
Get up, you're coming with me.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:30.191
Hey, I need some help. You want to put
on a good show or no? Let's go. Come on.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.459
Yes, who is it?

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.232
Mr. More, this is
Freddie Quell from The Cause.

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.932
I'd like to have a word.

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:51.307
Mr. Quell,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:54.278
Yes, sir, we have a gift
we'd like to present to you.

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:58.476
You'd like to present to me?
How do you... know where I live?

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.985
Um, can we come in,
just have a word?

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:05.251
How about if we do it right in
the doorway. How does that sound?

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.622
Sure, um...

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.097
Shit!

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:11.926
Jesus! Hey!

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.403
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.851
Well, I don't think you have
to worry about Mr. John More

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.010
speaking out against you.

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.149
What did you do?

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:42.652
He had a wise ass mouth.

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:45.732
My little soldier, what did you do?

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:49.098
- You need to tell me so that I know.
- No, I'm not going to tell you.

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:52.231
Nothing bad.

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:56.537
I just...
I just talked to him.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.646
But this is not the way.

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:01.511
Naughty boy, OK?

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:04.379
All right? Freddie?

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.717
You are a mischief.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.384
A horrible young man, you are.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:15.086
This is acting like an animal,

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:18.222
a dirty animal that eats
its own feces when hungry.

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.826
We stand far above that crowd.

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.202
Don't we?

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.848
- Well...
- We need to remember where we've met.

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.848
It's nagging at me.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.983
Isn't it you?

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.594
Thank you. Thank you.

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:53.429
Thank you.
Down, but not out.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:58.034
No, not dead yet.

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:02.605
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.376
Welcome to Philadelphia!

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:11.918
- Everyone all right?
- I'm gonna race you!

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.451
You win!

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.821
You won, you won.

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:22.156
- Peggy, Elizabeth.
- Hello.

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:23.263
Clark.

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:28.426
<i>When we travel back
in the Time Hole,</i>

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:31.436
there's a different feel
to another period in time

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.168
that is so basic
it's hard to describe.

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:40.270
So if you find yourself in a room...

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:49.318
...allow that there may be color
with unfamiliar tones,

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.425
perhaps because
the gaslight shining on it.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:59.324
There may be a strange quality
to the air.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:03.426
Its particles of dust derive
from un-modern constituents.

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:10.341
Even human bodies seem to radiate
a different kind of warmth

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:14.881
when covered with the fabrics
of another age.

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:18.781
Now, memory filters
all of that out.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:24.884
But... when we return this way,

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:29.224
the Cause Way,
the way Master has discovered,

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:32.026
everything is intact.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.429
With such gratitude.

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:48.179
Thank you.

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:50.978
What a welcome to Philadelphia.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.492
- I'm in love.

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:06.431
I'm in love.
We've all been in love.

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:10.526
And when we're in love,
we experience pleasure...

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:13.735
...and extreme pain.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.871
And that's what
I'd like to talk about.

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:32.186
<i>"Go Roving."</i>

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.385
"Go Roving" in "G."

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:13.929
- Aw...

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:52.800
Sotto voce.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:30.368
- Everyone!

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.229
Yes.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:06.506
You can do whatever you want...

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:09.610
...as long as I don't find out.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.283
And as long as no one
that I know knows about it.

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:20.986
- Other than that,

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:24.529
stop with this idea.

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:27.930
Put it back in its pants.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:32.437
It didn't work for them,
and it's not going to work for you.

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:35.633
We have enough problems
as it is, OK?

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.937
- Can you come for me?
- Oh, yes.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.239
- Come for me.
- Oh, yes.

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:40.642
...best behavior out.

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.271
- Come for me?
- Yes.

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.577
- And no more of that boy's hooch.
- No more hooch.

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:45.947
- Say it again.
- No more hooch.

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:49.545
- Come for me.

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:55.294
Yes. Oh!

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:16.307
Freddie, wake up.

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:18.543
Come on. Wake up.

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.945
Come on.
Get yourself up.

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:23.954
- Wake up. Come on.
- Wait.

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:26.116
God. Yeah, come on.

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:28.626
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.458
Wake up.
Nothing's the matter.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:33.590
I'm here to help you
with something.

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.895
- Wake up. Are you awake?
- I'm up!

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:38.500
- You awake?
- Yes.

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.903
- Look at me.

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:47.005
Freddie, I want you to place something
in the future for yourself.

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:52.046
I want you to place something
in the future for yourself

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:54.313
that you would like to have.

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.851
And tell me when it's done.

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:01.953
OK.

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:04.894
Now, it's there waiting for you,

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:09.230
and you can go and get it
whenever you're ready.

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:12.669
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:18.338
You can't stay with us any more
unless you quit boozing.

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.572
All right.

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:24.879
- Now tell me.
- What?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:30.855
- Tell me that you will quit boozing.
- I'll quit boozing.

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.323
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:37.420
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.693
- Say it again.
- I'll quit boozing.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.408
You know you should wake up, Val.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.496
Your father's speaking,
you might learn something.

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:35.414
He's making all this up
as he goes along.

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:38.218
You don't see that?

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:41.624
I can sleep and wake up
and not have missed one thing.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:49.102
- You got something to say to me?
- No, sir.

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:52.000
Well, you should have.

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:56.098
You should say something.
Do something.

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:59.110
Say "fuck you." Be a man!

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:12.449
OK, you're all right,

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:15.027
you're fine, you're fine, OK?

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.221
Sit down and shut up.

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.032
Good afternoon.

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.765
Come home. You're late.

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:30.140
It's a beautiful house.
Are you the owner?

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:33.178
- No, sir.
- Is that how your mother said it?

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.339
We're looking for
Lancaster Dodd.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:38.350
- I don't know who that is.
- He's in the house.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.675
- Well, may I come in?
- He's just inside. Yes, come in.

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:43.052
- Now hold on.
- Are you the owner?

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:44.555
No, sir.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.853
Well, I have a civil warrant here

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:49.189
- for a Lancaster Dodd.
- You're late.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.229
Release and return
to present time.

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:52.855
- Excuse me, Kim.
- The owner's in the house.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.092
May I come in?

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.793
No, you can't.
We're gonna have to talk to...

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:57.130
- He's just inside.
- I have a warrant here

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:59.034
to serve Lancaster Dodd.
A civil warrant.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.868
What's happening here?

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:03.033
Good afternoon.
Are you Lancaster Dodd?

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.872
Good afternoon. Yes, I am.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:08.003
I have a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.547
Goody. What are the charges?

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:14.483
By the district court
of Pennsylvania,

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.590
The Mildred Drummond Foundation

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:18.350
for wrongful withdrawal of funds.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.255
This is a silly joke, no?

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:22.157
- No, it isn't, sir.
- This is...

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:24.284
I have to take you in
and book and fingerprint you.

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:25.526
...comic opera.

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.861
Is it illegal in this city
to get better?

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:31.062
No, but it's illegal to operate
a medical school without a license.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.070
This is not a medical school,
it's a house.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.197
Sir, this is my home
and these are my guests.

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:37.401
Ma'am, this is the City of
Philadelphia Police Department.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:40.377
We have no disagreement with these boys
doing their work and all its silliness

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:42.106
as defenders of what code?

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:44.114
Well, we're with the City of
Philadelphia Police Department.

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:47.379
- What honor?! What honor do you have?!
- State of Pennsylvania, sir.

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:50.029
- Put your hands behind your back.
- What part of the galaxy...?

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.593
This is a scientific gathering.

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.756
Freddie! No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.797
- Calm down!
- No! Freddie!

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:02.198
Freddie! Calm down! No!

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.201
Calm down!
Do not hurt him!

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:07.504
Freddie!

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:10.269
It'll be OK!
Please, don't hurt him!

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:13.209
- I am with you, Daddy.
- You'll be out in no time.

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:15.713
We'll be...
we'll be out shortly!

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:19.410
- Just laugh!

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:25.153
- Just laugh.
- Everyone's laughing.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.260
- Not you.
- I'll bring him to the station.

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:30.826
We're following right behind.
We'll be right there.

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:33.160
- OK. I'm fine. I'm fine. OK.
- We're following right behind you.

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:34.494
I'm with you, Daddy.

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.292
I'm fine. I love you!

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:37.927
Love you, too!

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:41.358
Your fear of capture
and imprisonment

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.868
is an implant from
millions of years ago.

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:53.139
This battle has been with you
from before you know.

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:56.708
This is not you.

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:58.647
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's not you.

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:01.755
- Shut the fuck up!
- It's not you.

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:05.450
- You are asleep.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:11.326
Your spirit was free...

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:15.094
...moving from body
to the next body, free...

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:17.100
Free for a moment.

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:19.398
Then it was captured
by an invader force

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.371
bent on turning you
to the darkest way.

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:23.669
You've been implanted
with a push-pull mechanism

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:28.270
that keeps you fearful of
authority and destructive.

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:31.282
We are in the middle of a battle
that's a trillion years in the making,

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:34.353
- and it's bigger than the both of us.
- You're making this shit up!

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.649
You make this shit up!

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.780
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:41.053
I don't know what
I'm talking about?

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.685
No, you don't.

01:18:44.352 --> 01:18:46.093
I give you facts.

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:48.428
- You don't give me facts!
- They are not opinions.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.901
- What facts? What facts?
- They are fucking facts!

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.562
- What facts? What facts?
- Fuck you!

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:54.640
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:56.538
- Why don't you kick the bed some more?
- Fuck you!

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.576
- Fuck you, you lazy ass piece of shit!
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.077
- I'm not lazy!
- I'm done!

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:02.648
- You're fucking lazy!
- Oh, you make shit up...

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:05.251
- You're fuckin' lazy!
- Your fucking family hates you!

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:07.216
- Your son hates you!
- Oh, they do?

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:09.788
- Yeah! Your son hates you.
- Who fucking likes you except for me?

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:11.584
- Nobody!
- Except for me.

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:14.557
- No, you don't fucking like me.
- Who likes you except for me?

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:15.684
Shut up!

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:17.763
- Except for me?
- You, shut up!

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.661
- I'm the only one who likes you.
- Fuck you!

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:21.290
- Fuck you, too!
- Fuck you!

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:22.993
Fuck you!

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.799
- Just me, Freddie.
- Just you?

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:28.032
I'm the only one that likes you.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.038
The only one.

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:38.580
You're a fucking drunk.

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:41.449
And I'm done with you.
Fucking...

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:02.967
- Mr. Dodd?
- Yes?

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:05.806
You're hereby ordered
to pay back $11,000

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.938
to the Mildred Drummond Foundation
no later than June first,

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:11.209
otherwise to incur
penalties of interest.

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:14.650
There's also the matter of
$1,500 in fuel and damages

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:19.122
to Mrs. Drummond's sailing yacht,
that shall be repaid on the same date.

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:44.878
- Dad?
- Yes?

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:51.853
I don't think Freddie's as committed
to The Cause as The Cause is to him.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:58.559
When I told Freddie about
your unpublished work...

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:03.594
...his question to me was...

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:06.638
... "What is something like that worth?"

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:11.474
I think Freddie Quell's a spy.

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:16.713
Perhaps working
for some outside agency,

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:21.150
or the man's working for himself.

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:25.486
To steal and sell your book
to any dissenters who may want it.

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:32.428
"How do we know who he is?"
is perhaps the question.

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.567
And "What is the reason
he is here if he is past help?"

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.705
He makes me nervous.

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:51.244
I think he wants me.

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:53.546
I think he's in love with me.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:02.751
I wonder how he got here,
and what he's after.

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:06.559
Is it really all so easy
that he just came across us?

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:09.328
He's a drunk,
and he's dangerous.

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:12.563
And he will be our undoing
if we continue to have him here.

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.042
Thank you...

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:24.982
...all of you...

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:27.586
...for your honesty.

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:32.886
But...

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:38.353
...if we are not helping him,

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:42.434
then it is we
who have failed him.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.296
'Tis it not?

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.935
Perhaps he's past help.

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:55.640
Or insane.

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:01.348
Thank you, truly.

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:02.887
Thank you.

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:05.685
Food for thought.

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.491
There you go.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:20.666
Oh! Almost.

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:17.059
Freddie, stand in the middle
of the room, please.

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:29.702
Pick a spot over there,
touch it, and describe it to me.

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:37.244
Um... It's wood, wall.

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:41.184
Fine, fine.
Walk to this window over here.

01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:44.188
Touch a spot on the window
and describe it to me.

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.055
It just feels like glass.

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:51.061
Well, that's because it is glass.

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:54.065
Describe it.
Describe it the best you can.

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:57.898
- Well, it's smooth.
- Right.

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:01.405
It's warm, warmer than the wood,
because the sun's coming through.

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:02.872
Very good.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:08.608
Very good. Now, walk to
that wall again, touch a spot.

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.477
Close your eyes.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.846
Close your eyes.

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:16.012
<i>This exercise will help
you with your concentration.</i>

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:18.556
What color are my eyes?

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:22.359
Green.

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:25.653
Turn them blue.

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:31.669
A Ferris wheel?

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.431
That's beautiful. Back again.

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:36.308
Faster, please.

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:37.432
Ooh.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.104
Could we move that back?

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:42.476
- It's a fucking wall!
- Could we move that back, please?

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.408
I feel it! It's wood!

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.515
Turn them black.

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:52.849
What color are my eyes?

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:56.757
Black.

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:00.890
Very good.

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:06.802
What we will do now
will urge you toward existence

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:10.967
within a group,
society or family.

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:14.740
This is called Application 45,
Version 1.

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:21.214
No matter what is said between
the subjects, we do not react.

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:24.346
- OK.
- No matter what is said.

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:29.057
And you must look at the subject.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:31.494
You must look at the subject.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.960
All right?

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.397
One minute.

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:40.964
Clark, you may begin.

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:44.809
Doris.

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:49.682
- Fail.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:51.078
Fail.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.210
It's the same fucking wall.

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:57.380
Nothing. Nothing.
That's what I feel, nothing.

01:26:57.512 --> 01:27:01.392
All right.
Lunch on the veranda today.

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:03.621
So, if you could all move,
except for you, Freddie.

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:05.492
Back again, please?

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.868
Everyone.

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.663
Beautiful day.

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:16.364
Well, luckily, I don't care.

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:19.205
- Doris, Doris, Doris, Doris, Doris.
- Doris.

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:22.713
See, it doesn't even affect me.

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.817
Doris. Say it.

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:26.384
- Doris.
- Doris.

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:28.316
- Doris.
- Doris, see?

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:29.444
- You miss her?
- Huh?

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:30.555
Do you miss Doris?

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:33.625
Say her fucking name again,
I swear to God.

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.750
- Doris.
- I swear to fucking God!

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:37.362
Doris.

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:43.663
Doris, Doris, Doris.

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:46.294
This is difficult for you.

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:51.669
Listen.

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:54.837
"'It's really a damn shame to tease you
so, my little whore, he laughed,

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:58.075
'So, I will get the dildo
out of my cabinet in the next room.'

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:01.187
He was scarcely gone many
seconds before he returned,

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:04.153
and I felt his fingers
opening the lips of my cunt.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:07.351
'Oh, oh, who is that?'
I screamed from under my skirt."

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:08.803
I don't want to hear any of this.

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:12.524
Just listen. No reaction.

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:16.295
"Kiss her. Put your tongue
in her mouth, my boy.

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:19.997
Fuck, fuck, fuck away."

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:25.842
Rocks, covered in moss.

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:33.680
Fields, running around,
barbed wire.

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:40.789
Open, storm...

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:46.031
Apples. Daddy, can you
pass the apples, please?

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:49.727
Cold, out at night.

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:53.168
Meadow... open.

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.864
Back again!

01:28:57.298 --> 01:29:02.247
- It's a hard, slow process.
- I just don't understand it.

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:06.113
I don't either.
That's why we're here.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.896
Do not do that, please?

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.899
Resume the exercise,
no matter what is said.

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:26.835
- What?
- You may talk to Clark.

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:30.008
One minute.

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:32.077
Whatever comes to your mind.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.077
True or false.

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.910
I don't want to say anything.

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:41.213
Then don't say anything.
Just look at him. One minute.

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:43.881
Starting now.

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.827
I want to fart in your face.

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:03.772
I wish I could fart.
Because I'd fart in your face right now.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:10.682
Um...

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.583
Wallpaper.

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:16.210
Um...

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:22.119
I don't know,
this is getting really hard.

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:32.269
OK, all right.

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:34.566
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:36.766
I don't know.

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:39.435
How is this helping?

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:42.372
You'll see.

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:49.921
Doris.
She got rid of you, right?

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:55.050
She saw you for what you are:
selfish and alone.

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:59.254
You should go into the hospital
with your mother,

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:01.628
because that's where you belong.

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:04.862
Because you're sick,
and you're tired,

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:08.269
and you need to be alone,
away from people.

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:28.988
<i>How many people
you kill, dummy?</i>

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:33.291
<i>Are you drunk, dummy?</i>

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:35.594
<i>Did you blow them all up
and burn them?</i>

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:40.005
<i>Dummy, dummy, dummy.</i>

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:43.631
Can you stay still, dummy?

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.804
Can you, dum-dum?

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:50.847
Are you a loser?

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:53.179
You lunkhead.

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:02.059
Fail.

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.823
- But...
- Fail.

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:06.522
Mannequin...

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.362
It's a fucking wall!

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:43.526
It's a fucking wall.
It's a fucking wall.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:46.764
It's a fucking wall.
And I'm not in it.

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:50.933
I'm not in it. It's a window
and I can leave any time I want.

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:54.012
But I choose not to.
I choose to stay here.

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.618
It's breathing.

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:37.715
<i>No matter what is said,
we do not react.</i>

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:40.815
Freddie, you may begin.

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:49.129
I was on a ship that got
13 battle stars and won the war.

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:51.293
What'd you do, dummy?

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:04.347
<i>I can feel outside,
I can touch the neighbor's house.</i>

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:08.818
I can touch the plants,
I can touch the stars,

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:11.184
I can touch anything I want.

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:15.093
And end of Application.

01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:20.232
- You're fucking with me.
- End of Application.

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:23.164
- Freddie, open your eyes.
- It's a fucking wall!

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:26.032
Open your eyes
and come back to me.

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:43.619
Very good.

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:48.783
Very good.

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:06.069
I am here to announce the first
Universal Congress of The Cause

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.878
to be held May 21st, 1950,
in Phoenix, Arizona,

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:14.179
a city named
for that glorious bird,

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:18.450
whose resurrection
from the ashes fits our own.

01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:21.719
And it is here we will
present Book II.

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:51.314
What's in it?

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:56.913
My unpublished work.

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.285
My life's work.

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:10.430
Hold on. Hold on.

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:25.709
All right.

01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:01.050
Please, come and join us.

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:04.884
Please, come get insight on
how to be freer, more productive,

01:38:05.012 --> 01:38:08.084
and more in command of your life.

01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:10.856
- Free yourself, ma'am.
- Don't...

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:14.762
Free yourself from past trauma.
Take command of your life, sir.

01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:16.891
Would you care for
some free processing?

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:22.236
Sir, would you care for some
free processing? It's free.

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:24.070
Free yourself from past traumas.

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:26.144
Free yourself from past trauma.

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:27.644
Free yourself from past trauma.

01:38:27.768 --> 01:38:29.247
Take control of your life.

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:31.213
Free yourself
from your ailments.

01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:33.375
Free yourself from your ailments.

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:35.068
Take control of your life, sir.

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:37.146
Take control of your life.

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:39.315
You don't have to
change your faith

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:41.892
or leave the congregation
you belong to.

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:44.895
So those interested in freedom
are urged to please come

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:48.831
for free sample processing sessions
in being younger, feeling freer,

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:51.095
and understanding
where you come from.

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:53.102
It works.

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:56.902
I added that.

01:38:57.965 --> 01:39:00.206
- OK, ready?
- Is it in focus?

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:03.537
I was just asking.

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:06.345
- Go ahead, snap away.
- OK.

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:07.918
Ready?

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:10.822
One, two...

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:34.745
Thank you.

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.304
Hi, Helen.

01:40:42.002 --> 01:40:43.538
It's almost here.

01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:45.907
That's enough.

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:51.248
That's enough now.

01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:53.373
You're gonna make me
red all over.

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:57.712
Thank you. Thank you.

01:41:58.912 --> 01:42:02.917
Book II... is about man.

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:09.293
And the title of the book
is The Split Saber.

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.960
And here we have some answers.

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:16.007
No more secrets.

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:22.774
The source of all creation...

01:42:25.339 --> 01:42:27.114
...good and evil...

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:30.418
...and the source of all...

01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:36.352
...now, funny enough,
the source of all...

01:42:38.252 --> 01:42:39.754
...is you.

01:42:47.161 --> 01:42:52.474
I have unlocked...
and discovered

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:57.708
a secret to living
in these bodies that we hold.

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:03.512
And, oh yes, it's very, very,

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:07.023
- VERY, VERY SERIOUS.

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:11.524
The secret...

01:43:13.153 --> 01:43:14.757
...is laughter.

01:43:25.132 --> 01:43:28.409
Now, I'd like to discuss
processing and communication.

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:32.072
The art of listening,
if you will.

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:11.848
Bill.

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.789
Hello.

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:19.721
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

01:44:23.223 --> 01:44:26.067
- You came from New York?
- New York City, yes.

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.937
So, what do you think
of the book?

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:39.246
What do you think about it?

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:41.444
I think it stinks.

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:44.522
If it were up to me I'd chop this thing
down to a three-page pamphlet

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:47.455
and hand it to people
before they got on the subway.

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:49.356
But I edited most of
his earlier work.

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:50.553
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:52.254
- Outside?
- Let me say this,

01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:54.764
the man is a grade-A mystic.

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:58.631
A true, original mystic
of the highest order.

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:03.936
But his work is garbled and twisted,
and let me tell you...

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:13.476
What... What is this?

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:03.559
- Hello.
- Helen.

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:06.398
- Author.
- Please.

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:09.939
- I've been reading the new book.
- What do you think?

01:46:10.063 --> 01:46:12.339
I think it's wonderful.

01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:14.844
- Wait till you get to the good parts.
- Oh, yes.

01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:22.411
Well, as I've begun, I did notice
on page 13 there's a change.

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:27.218
You've changed the
processing-platform question.

01:46:27.347 --> 01:46:29.884
Now it says,
"Can you imagine...?"

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:34.924
Yes.

01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:37.994
Yes.

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:44.870
If our previous method was to induce
memory by asking, "Can you recall,"

01:46:44.998 --> 01:46:47.639
doesn't it then change everything
if now we say, "Can you imagine?"

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:52.877
We are invoking a new, wider range
to account for the new data.

01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:58.888
"Can you imagine," allows for a more
creative pathway to the mind.

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:00.616
More open.

01:47:02.416 --> 01:47:04.555
- But if the new...
- What do you want?!

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:07.456
Helen.

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:12.828
This is the new work.

01:47:40.053 --> 01:47:41.657
Over here!

01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:47.765
The game is called
Pick-a-Point.

01:47:47.894 --> 01:47:53.344
You pick a point, drive straight at it,
as fast as you can.

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:55.674
I'll go first.

01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:58.749
I pick that winding road.

01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:26.478
Good job, Daddy!

01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:33.039
Ya-hoo!

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:39.184
Whoo!

01:48:54.794 --> 01:48:56.967
Whoo-hoo!

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:01.838
Whoo!

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:05.907
Thrilling!

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:10.044
- Thrilling.

01:49:13.713 --> 01:49:15.056
Freddie.

01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:20.855
Pick a point.

01:49:20.987 --> 01:49:22.660
Tell it to me.

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:28.434
The rock...
The mountain.

01:49:28.562 --> 01:49:30.473
The head.

01:49:30.597 --> 01:49:32.406
It's the head of an alligator.

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:34.011
Good.

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:08.404
Whoo! Freddie!
Go, Freddie!

01:50:31.558 --> 01:50:34.061
He's going very fast.

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:39.305
- Good boy.

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:07.199
Freddie!

01:52:16.730 --> 01:52:18.266
- Hello?

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:20.241
Hello?

01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:27.712
Mrs. Solstad,
I'm looking for Doris.

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:29.184
Oh.

01:52:30.944 --> 01:52:32.787
- What for?
- Because I'm looking for her,

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:35.324
because I want to talk to her.
That's what for.

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:38.827
Well, Doris is in Alabama right now.

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:44.459
- What's she doing in Alabama?
- Well, she's there with, um... Jim Day.

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:48.767
They're married. He's in ROTC
training, Navy flight training.

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:50.738
- Jim Day?
- Mm-hm.

01:52:50.864 --> 01:52:53.174
- Jim Day, Jim Day, that Jim Day?
- Yes.

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:57.008
- Jim Day from Somerville.
- Well, when'd that happen?

01:52:57.137 --> 01:53:00.175
They've been married
for three years.

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:02.547
Is he still ugly?

01:53:03.943 --> 01:53:05.945
She has two children.

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:09.288
Boys or girls?

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.786
Two boys.

01:53:13.887 --> 01:53:15.662
Are you coming back home?

01:53:17.056 --> 01:53:19.036
No, I was just visiting.

01:53:19.159 --> 01:53:21.935
I thought I'd see
if she was around, say hello.

01:53:22.061 --> 01:53:24.302
How's your family doing?

01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:26.341
Yeah, all right.

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:30.676
Well, she's not here.

01:53:32.505 --> 01:53:34.382
You could write her.
I have an address.

01:53:34.507 --> 01:53:37.181
I'm not gonna
write her a letter.

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:38.812
All right.

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:47.591
Was she upset last time I was here?
When I left her here?

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:51.034
- Yes.
- Was she broken up about it?

01:53:52.926 --> 01:53:54.564
Yes.

01:53:54.694 --> 01:53:58.198
- She told you what happened?
- Mm. Yeah.

01:53:58.331 --> 01:54:00.004
What'd she say?

01:54:02.468 --> 01:54:06.211
That you said that
you'd come back sometime.

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:08.341
Is that right?

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:12.020
It was a long time ago.

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:14.852
Where have you been?

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:20.230
I been working.
Working, traveling.

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:23.857
I think I've been halfway around
the world since I last saw Doris.

01:54:26.059 --> 01:54:27.732
How old is she now?

01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:29.863
Doris is 23.

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:33.641
'Cause I wanted to know.

01:54:35.869 --> 01:54:38.315
You know, she was...

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.348
She was too young when I...

01:54:44.077 --> 01:54:46.216
Well, she's happy,
and that's good.

01:54:49.482 --> 01:54:51.018
I'll tell her you came to see me.

01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:53.323
Ah, that's not gonna matter.

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:56.058
Give me a break.

01:55:03.162 --> 01:55:04.937
It was nice to see you.

01:55:06.032 --> 01:55:07.705
Am I leaving?

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:12.475
No. Whatever you'd like.
You can come in.

01:55:12.605 --> 01:55:16.985
- Nah. I gotta go.
- OK.

01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:19.317
Thank you.

01:55:19.445 --> 01:55:23.416
- How's Mr. Solstad?
- Why, he's very good.

01:55:23.549 --> 01:55:26.428
He's working, and...

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:29.055
- Will you tell him I said hello?
- All right.

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:37.006
So, her name is Doris Day?
Like the Doris Day?

01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:38.268
Yes.

01:55:38.598 --> 01:55:41.636
- The movie star.
- Yes.

01:55:45.308 --> 01:55:46.981
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:49.111
<i>My name is Casper.</i>

01:55:49.245 --> 01:55:52.624
<i>Hey, Casper.
Would you like to play pirate with me?</i>

01:55:52.748 --> 01:55:56.855
<i>Oh, boy! Would I!</i>

01:55:56.986 --> 01:55:59.626
<i>How are we gonna
tie this together, Casper?</i>

01:55:59.755 --> 01:56:02.326
<i>I found some rope.</i>

01:56:07.930 --> 01:56:11.343
<i>Gee, Casper,
you're a tricky one.</i>

01:56:17.973 --> 01:56:19.953
Hello?

01:56:20.076 --> 01:56:21.851
<i>I miss you.</i>

01:56:23.479 --> 01:56:25.618
How'd you find me?

01:56:25.748 --> 01:56:28.695
<i>We're tied together.</i>

01:56:28.818 --> 01:56:30.889
<i>Who got to you, Freddie?</i>

01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:34.399
<i>- What?
- Who got to you?</i>

01:56:34.523 --> 01:56:36.264
Nobody.

01:56:38.127 --> 01:56:41.370
<i>Come to England.
You'll love it here.</i>

01:56:41.497 --> 01:56:44.478
<i>Andi think it'll do you some good.
Can you do it?</i>

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:50.016
<i>- Where?
- We have a new school. It's in England.</i>

01:56:50.139 --> 01:56:52.244
Well, my spaceship's in the shop.

01:56:52.375 --> 01:56:55.379
<i>You've still got it.</i>

01:56:55.511 --> 01:56:57.650
<i>Would you bring me some Kools?</i>

01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:59.555
They don't have them there?

01:56:59.682 --> 01:57:02.629
<i>The only bad pan'
over here, no Kools.</i>

01:57:06.489 --> 01:57:07.866
How'd you find me?

01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:11.494
<i>Freddie, I have a matter
of such urgency,</i>

01:57:11.627 --> 01:57:14.164
<i>a matter that only you
can help me with.</i>

01:57:14.296 --> 01:57:17.937
<i>That may, in fact, cure
the insane once and for all.</i>

01:57:18.067 --> 01:57:20.172
<i>I can cure you.</i>

01:57:20.302 --> 01:57:22.339
<i>And I remember where we've met.</i>

01:57:22.471 --> 01:57:26.851
<i>- Come to England. I'll tell you.</i>

01:57:26.976 --> 01:57:30.423
<i>Now, for the treasure!</i>

01:57:30.546 --> 01:57:34.653
<i>"X" marks the spot
where the sunken treasure is.</i>

01:57:37.553 --> 01:57:39.965
<i>Golly, Billy, there's the "X."</i>

01:57:40.089 --> 01:57:42.535
<i>I'll get the treasure, Casper.</i>

01:57:42.658 --> 01:57:47.004
<i>The captain never
leaves the ship. I'll get it.</i>

01:58:19.395 --> 01:58:21.636
Hello. Welcome.

01:58:21.764 --> 01:58:24.335
Can we help you and
invite you to sit down?

01:58:24.467 --> 01:58:26.674
You look like
you've traveled here.

01:58:26.802 --> 01:58:30.147
- How else do you get someplace?

01:58:30.272 --> 01:58:33.981
- Can I assist you in help?
- I'm here to see Master.

01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:37.579
- And what's your name?
- Freddie Quell.

01:58:37.713 --> 01:58:40.956
- Is he expecting you?
- He should be.

01:58:45.921 --> 01:58:47.832
I took that picture.

01:59:10.579 --> 01:59:12.183
Hello, Freddie.

01:59:13.349 --> 01:59:14.919
Val.

01:59:16.018 --> 01:59:17.793
You look good.

01:59:19.855 --> 01:59:21.493
Come on.

01:59:26.996 --> 01:59:29.943
- Can I get this for you?
- No, thank you.

01:59:35.538 --> 01:59:39.042
- How are you?
- Couldn't be better.

02:00:16.245 --> 02:00:17.724
Hello.

02:00:18.414 --> 02:00:19.825
Hi.

02:00:29.191 --> 02:00:31.831
Thank you.

02:00:33.062 --> 02:00:34.370
Thank you.

02:01:10.799 --> 02:01:12.574
Some place.

02:01:18.741 --> 02:01:20.414
Are you drunk?

02:01:22.211 --> 02:01:24.157
No. No, no.

02:01:28.717 --> 02:01:31.163
You look sick.

02:01:31.286 --> 02:01:33.288
Freddie, you don't look healthy.

02:01:35.290 --> 02:01:38.430
I don't look like that.
That's not how I look.

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.097
You don't think you can?

02:01:41.230 --> 02:01:43.039
It's just not how I look.

02:01:46.101 --> 02:01:49.139
You can't take this life straight,
can you?

02:01:56.245 --> 02:01:57.747
What do you want?

02:02:00.916 --> 02:02:02.520
I don't know.

02:02:04.953 --> 02:02:07.991
I had a dream...

02:02:14.697 --> 02:02:16.608
Where's Elizabeth?

02:02:18.667 --> 02:02:23.776
- DCF.
- Really? What is that?

02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:29.049
What did you expect
would happen coming here?

02:02:34.183 --> 02:02:36.390
I can take pictures...

02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:39.529
...if you need them.

02:02:41.457 --> 02:02:43.698
We don't need pictures, Freddie.

02:02:46.562 --> 02:02:49.941
This is something you do
for a billion years or not at all.

02:02:50.065 --> 02:02:52.409
This isn't fashion.

02:03:01.477 --> 02:03:03.013
This is pointless.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:07.058
He isn't interested
in getting better.

02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:23.203
She's really softened up.

02:03:33.776 --> 02:03:36.382
Free winds
and no tyranny for you?

02:03:39.348 --> 02:03:40.793
Freddie...

02:03:43.585 --> 02:03:48.295
...sailor of the seas.

02:03:48.423 --> 02:03:50.130
You pay no rent.

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:53.933
Free to go where you please.

02:03:59.268 --> 02:04:01.407
Then go.

02:04:03.472 --> 02:04:08.922
Go to that landless latitude,
and good luck.

02:04:12.314 --> 02:04:17.263
For if you figure a way to live
without serving a master...

02:04:19.254 --> 02:04:20.824
...any master...

02:04:22.558 --> 02:04:25.562
...then let the rest us know,
will you?

02:04:27.930 --> 02:04:31.400
For you'd be the first person
in the history of the world.

02:04:36.805 --> 02:04:42.778
In my dream, you said you'd...
you figured out where we met.

02:04:46.515 --> 02:04:51.624
I went back and I found it.

02:04:51.753 --> 02:04:54.359
I recalled you and I working together...

02:04:55.824 --> 02:04:58.566
...in Paris.

02:04:58.694 --> 02:05:01.732
We were members
of the Pigeon Post.

02:05:01.864 --> 02:05:04.208
During a four and a half month siege

02:05:04.333 --> 02:05:06.870
of the city by Prussian forces.

02:05:08.537 --> 02:05:12.075
We worked and rigged balloons...

02:05:12.207 --> 02:05:16.087
...that delivered mail
and secret messages...

02:05:16.211 --> 02:05:19.818
...across the communications blockade,

02:05:19.948 --> 02:05:22.690
set up by the Prussians.

02:05:22.818 --> 02:05:27.665
We sent 65 unguided mail balloons
and only two went missing.

02:05:30.292 --> 02:05:32.397
In the worst winter on record.

02:05:41.904 --> 02:05:43.349
Two.

02:05:52.247 --> 02:05:55.626
If you leave here,
I don't ever want to see you again.

02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:06.935
Or you can stay.

02:06:13.835 --> 02:06:16.042
Maybe in the next life?

02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:20.980
If we meet again
in the next life,

02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:25.956
you will be my sworn enemy,
and I will show you no mercy.

02:09:20.122 --> 02:09:23.001
Do you think you could just
look into my eyes and not blink,

02:09:23.125 --> 02:09:26.265
and I'm gonna ask you some
questions that'll help you?

02:09:26.394 --> 02:09:28.169
Maybe.

02:09:28.296 --> 02:09:32.108
All right. Starting now.
You can't blink.

02:09:32.234 --> 02:09:33.440
You just look in my eyes.

02:09:33.568 --> 02:09:35.309
- You're already blinking.

02:09:35.437 --> 02:09:37.678
Starting now, all right?
What's your name?

02:09:37.806 --> 02:09:40.912
- I told you...
- No, just say your name.

02:09:41.042 --> 02:09:42.851
You don't remember?

02:09:42.978 --> 02:09:46.824
- Just say your name.
- You're drunk.

02:09:46.948 --> 02:09:48.791
You have to say your name.
And you blinked,

02:09:48.917 --> 02:09:51.830
infringement, back to the start.
Now, say your name.

02:09:51.953 --> 02:09:53.591
Winn.

02:09:53.722 --> 02:09:59.138
- Now say your full name.
- Winn Manchester.

02:09:59.261 --> 02:10:03.300
- Say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

02:10:03.431 --> 02:10:06.708
- Say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

02:10:06.835 --> 02:10:10.339
- Now, say it again.
- Winn Manchester.

02:10:10.472 --> 02:10:12.975
Have you ever lived before?

02:10:14.676 --> 02:10:16.485
I don't know.

02:10:19.314 --> 02:10:21.760
Maybe this isn't your only life.

02:10:24.819 --> 02:10:28.357
- I hope it isn't.

02:10:31.193 --> 02:10:33.002
You're the bravest girl
I've ever known.

02:10:37.832 --> 02:10:40.108
Now stick it back in,
it fell out.
