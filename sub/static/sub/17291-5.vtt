WEBVTT

01:09.700 --> 01:14.740
<i> Okay, my people!</i>
<i>Rise and shine. Get up, Stripe.</i>

01:17.620 --> 01:19.420
Hey. You awake yet?

01:19.980 --> 01:23.540
- Sure as shit ain't dreaming no more.
- Company!

01:23.620 --> 01:26.420
Something went down last night
in Her Falls,

01:26.980 --> 01:28.820
a village about three miles east.

01:29.340 --> 01:33.260
We've got reports of a food store
broken into, shit stolen.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.660
Locals think it's roaches.

01:35.740 --> 01:36.980
Roaches!

01:37.060 --> 01:40.060
We head out in five minutes. Let's go!

01:42.340 --> 01:45.980
Hey, so, it looks like you're getting
your first real-live roach hunt, huh?

02:12.340 --> 02:13.460
Hey, new!

02:15.740 --> 02:16.540
New!

02:17.220 --> 02:18.460
It's Stripe.

02:18.540 --> 02:20.660
Here's a little tip just in case
you get your first toe-to-toe

02:20.740 --> 02:22.300
-with one of them roaches today.
-Uh-huh?

02:23.620 --> 02:24.820
When you see one right here,

02:25.340 --> 02:28.340
try not to shit your pants.
It's only gonna piss them off.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.260
-I'll try.
-Try to ignore Len.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.700
His aim's so bad,
he's the only guy on Earth

02:34.780 --> 02:36.860
who could shit his own pants and miss.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.260
-Fuck you, farm girl.
-Farm girl?

02:39.780 --> 02:41.420
Yeah. Hunting's in my blood.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.460
Some of us are naturals.

02:43.540 --> 02:44.340
Moving out!

02:47.980 --> 02:50.140
Whoo! Yeah!

03:02.140 --> 03:03.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

03:07.060 --> 03:09.340
You can speak now.

03:11.740 --> 03:15.540
- <i> It must have been roaches.</i>
- Roaches, you see them? You see?

03:16.260 --> 03:18.700
<i>I didn't see them.</i>

03:18.780 --> 03:22.940
<i> I heard them.</i>
<i>All the mess. It must have been them.</i>

03:23.020 --> 03:25.220
Want a cookie?

03:25.300 --> 03:27.700
- Here you go.
<i>-  They've been in the food.</i>

03:30.220 --> 03:32.540
<i> We'll have to destroy</i>
<i>everything they left.</i>

03:33.420 --> 03:34.500
<i>No one will eat it.</i>

03:36.260 --> 03:37.980
We can replace that, okay?

03:42.100 --> 03:45.260
<i> They destroyed the cooler.</i>
<i>Broke it and took the parts.</i>

03:45.940 --> 03:48.060
The cooler?
They stole parts from the cooler?

03:50.260 --> 03:51.980
Which way did they go?

03:54.940 --> 03:57.420
<i> There were footprints</i>
<i>in the dirt leading that way.</i>

03:57.500 --> 03:59.660
Parn Heidekker.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.180
Parn Heidekker.

04:03.260 --> 04:05.220
Heidekker? Is that a name?

04:09.100 --> 04:11.940
Stop them coming. Please, you must stop.

04:13.140 --> 04:13.940
Okay.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.500
I have child who is scared.

04:19.020 --> 04:21.220
I will. I promise.

04:28.860 --> 04:29.980
Stripe!

04:36.980 --> 04:38.980
Okay. Our friend here thinks
that the roaches

04:39.060 --> 04:40.820
went in the direction
of Parn Heidekker's place.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.180
Local oddball, seems to be some kind
of religious freak.

04:43.260 --> 04:45.580
Anderson, Hague, I want you
to stay here and help them torch the food,

04:45.660 --> 04:47.060
keep them calm and reassured.

04:47.140 --> 04:49.420
The rest of you,
we're gonna drop in on Heidekker.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.420
Ask some questions,
sniff around the place.

04:51.860 --> 04:54.260
If there's roaches,
we show we're ready for them. Let's go.

04:55.260 --> 04:59.380
So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly
what you call a socialite or a mingler.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.900
Seems like mental health issues.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.700
He's got some interesting views
on roaches, by all accounts.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.900
I'm putting his info
in your Mass system now.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.460
Been complaints lodged against him
going months back.

05:11.540 --> 05:14.820
Locals claim that he let roaches
cross his land, left food out for them.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.580
Could be just shit talk
from the local villagers though so...

05:28.500 --> 05:30.140
Yo, how many roaches
we got left out here?

05:30.900 --> 05:33.180
A couple of thousand?
A couple of hundred, if that?

05:33.700 --> 05:36.100
I mean, back home we had millions, man.

05:36.180 --> 05:38.140
It only took two years
to get shit back on track.

05:38.220 --> 05:41.020
Out here you got rustic fucks
throwing them scraps.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.100
No wonder it's taken so long
to mop shit up.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.580
But how can anyone be dumb enough
to help a fucking roach?

05:46.100 --> 05:46.940
Hell, yeah.

06:01.540 --> 06:02.540
Portals front and rear.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.700
Windows blacked out.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.540
Chimney smoke. Someone's home.

06:14.780 --> 06:16.420
Lennard, you use the boomer.

06:41.580 --> 06:43.900
Okay, Mass check. Everyone got the layout?

06:43.980 --> 06:45.020
- Check.
- Check.

06:47.420 --> 06:48.300
Check.

06:48.380 --> 06:51.620
Aikin, Valcon, Coach,
you check the outbuildings here.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.180
Take them one at a time and slow.

06:54.020 --> 06:56.940
Stripe, Raiman,
you come with me and Lennard.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.380
We go in here.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.260
Len and I will talk to Heidekker,
you check the rest of the house.

07:02.700 --> 07:03.780
Okay.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.940
Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

07:08.020 --> 07:09.260
Except on a roach.

07:09.340 --> 07:10.380
Except on a roach.

07:35.660 --> 07:37.900
Morning, sir.

07:37.980 --> 07:40.180
There's no need for this.
I speak your language.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.540
Okay.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.860
-What is it you want?
-Just to talk.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.300
That's what we're doing.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.340
Be a little more neighbourly
if we did it inside.

08:00.460 --> 08:01.420
Check the upstairs rooms.

08:18.340 --> 08:21.020
Relax. I'm not your enemy.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.860
Where are they?

08:28.700 --> 08:30.060
Where are who?

08:36.740 --> 08:37.740
You know, we got a whole bunch

08:37.820 --> 08:39.980
of frightened, angry people
in that village.

08:40.780 --> 08:44.500
Roaches have been breaking
into the food stores, stealing supplies.

08:45.540 --> 08:46.740
You know anything about that?

08:48.780 --> 08:49.780
No.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.220
See, it's not just what they stole.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.940
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.940
- No one's gonna eat it.
- Stripe.

08:59.020 --> 09:01.300
Makes life harder for everyone.

09:04.460 --> 09:07.340
Cross on the wall there.
You got principles.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.540
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.620
I agree. All life is sacred so...

09:14.700 --> 09:17.820
you even got to protect the roaches.
Right?

09:19.220 --> 09:22.740
It's not their fault they're like that.
They didn't ask for this.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.220
I get it. We get it.

09:28.580 --> 09:30.020
Mm-hmm.

09:36.980 --> 09:39.540
There's shit
in their blood that made them that way.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.180
The sickness they're carrying.

09:43.260 --> 09:45.300
That doesn't care about
the sanctity of life

09:45.380 --> 09:48.540
or the pain
about who else is gonna suffer.

09:49.420 --> 09:54.460
We don't stop the roaches,
in five, ten, 20 years from now,

09:54.540 --> 09:58.380
you're still gonna get kids born that way,
and then they're gonna breed.

10:03.780 --> 10:04.780
Bingo.

10:06.180 --> 10:08.340
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.180
That sickness,
and it could have been avoided.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.420
Fucking roach nest.

10:22.140 --> 10:24.340
You check in there. I'll take the stairs.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.300
Every roach you save today,

10:27.380 --> 10:32.460
you condemn God knows how many people
to despair and misery tomorrow.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.620
You can't still see them as human.

10:37.740 --> 10:41.460
Understandable sentiment, granted,
but it's misguided.

10:45.260 --> 10:48.980
We gotta take them out if humankind
is gonna carry on in this world.

10:51.740 --> 10:53.100
That's just the hard truth.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.140
Gotta make sacrifices.

11:16.860 --> 11:17.980
What the fuck?

11:38.380 --> 11:41.540
Help me out here!

12:05.620 --> 12:06.620
Fuck!

13:59.140 --> 14:00.300
Rai!

14:01.780 --> 14:04.780
We gotta listen to Mr. Sunday School
all the way back to base?

14:04.860 --> 14:06.420
You can cover your ears.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.620
Yeah, or, uh....
I'll just hit permanent mute.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.540
Lower your weapon.

14:13.340 --> 14:15.460
Roach lover counts as a kill too, right?

14:17.500 --> 14:18.380
He's a civ, right?

14:22.900 --> 14:25.820
You shoot a civ, that's gonna stay
with you the rest of your life.

14:29.580 --> 14:34.180
Yo, Stripe, why don't you, uh...
pull the stick out of your ass?

14:34.260 --> 14:37.020
Because I'm fucking with him, not you.

14:37.660 --> 14:40.380
I guess I had you both going, right?

14:40.460 --> 14:41.460
All right!

14:43.380 --> 14:44.820
Let's torch the place.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.260
Hey, you okay, man?

14:59.060 --> 15:00.220
Yeah.

15:37.460 --> 15:40.260
-I heard you popped one in there.
-Two.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.300
Wait, two?

15:42.380 --> 15:47.420
- I got another one, with my knife.
- With your knife? Holy shit!

15:47.500 --> 15:50.300
-Pretty good, right?
-Yeah, you fucking Terminator.

15:51.020 --> 15:53.020
Damn! First time out, he gets two.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.820
You lucky motherfucker, man.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.340
Sweet dreams for this asshole.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.060
Gonna get a treat tonight.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.020
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

16:40.220 --> 16:41.700
I love you.

17:13.340 --> 17:15.620
Whoa! Miss Sharp Shooter.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.140
Patronising fuck!

17:22.260 --> 17:24.500
Ruthless! You're the Grim Reaper.

17:24.580 --> 17:27.020
Yeah, well, no roach gets away next time.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.020
Are you still sweating that?

17:29.700 --> 17:33.900
Well, I grew up tracking deer.
You never give up.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.260
I don't like it when they get away.

17:39.820 --> 17:40.860
Nice.

17:40.940 --> 17:42.700
Yeah,
if that fucker made it to the forest,

17:43.220 --> 17:45.300
probably made it to the border,
gone for good.

17:46.180 --> 17:47.900
Yeah. It's all right for you.

17:50.420 --> 17:51.780
You popped two of 'em.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.780
It's been a while for me.

17:54.860 --> 17:57.180
You know, the gal is getting twitchy.

17:57.260 --> 17:58.860
Come on, Rai.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.460
You sleep good?

18:01.540 --> 18:03.620
Yeah, I slept OK.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.380
What, that's all you're gonna give me?

18:06.460 --> 18:09.460
Okay? You know, if I got two in one go,

18:09.540 --> 18:12.340
I would want to come for like an hour!

18:12.420 --> 18:14.620
All right, shut up.

18:16.620 --> 18:17.420
All right.

18:20.980 --> 18:23.300
Ah! That's the way.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.340
Hey, you okay, man?

18:36.420 --> 18:39.140
Yeah, think I'm tired is all.

18:39.780 --> 18:41.980
Uh-huh?
All right, so you did have a good night.

18:45.020 --> 18:47.900
39, 40, 41....

18:48.780 --> 18:50.340
42...

18:50.420 --> 18:55.100
43, 44, 45, 46,

18:55.780 --> 18:59.580
47, 48, 49,

18:59.660 --> 19:04.660
50, 51, 52,

19:04.740 --> 19:09.060
53, 54, 55,

19:09.140 --> 19:14.820
56, 57, 58, 59...

19:21.740 --> 19:23.340
Strong and pure.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.140
Strong and pure.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.140
-Hey, Stripe, you okay?
-Yeah.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.380
I mean, I... don't know.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.100
I feel a little off.

19:55.340 --> 19:57.380
I mean, I ain't sick or nothing.
It's just, uh...

19:57.460 --> 19:59.220
Report to the sick bay.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.540
Running diagnostic.

20:09.980 --> 20:10.980
What do you see?

20:11.980 --> 20:13.020
A cube.

20:16.740 --> 20:19.260
-Rotating?
-Yeah.

20:22.580 --> 20:25.260
-And now?
-A tree.

20:26.060 --> 20:28.900
-Like an apple tree.
-Touch the apples for me.

20:36.980 --> 20:38.300
Full marks.

20:39.820 --> 20:43.220
-So you say you had like a headache?
-Yeah, but just quick.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.660
Nothing big, just...

20:47.940 --> 20:49.460
Well, everything looks okay.

20:49.540 --> 20:53.140
No sign of any malfunction
or dropout with your Mass implant.

20:53.220 --> 20:56.100
And physically,
you're in exemplary shape.

20:58.700 --> 21:02.780
You've just seen combat,
you can expect some sort of side effect.

21:02.860 --> 21:06.220
There was this, uh... this thing...

21:07.860 --> 21:10.260
with a light on it at the farmhouse.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.620
-Roach had it.
-A roach had it?

21:14.700 --> 21:16.980
-Kind of like a flashlight.
-Flashlight?

21:17.620 --> 21:18.420
Kinda.

21:19.980 --> 21:20.780
I don't know.

21:21.460 --> 21:26.180
Seriously, you're fine. Your Mass is fine.
Blood's fine. It's all fine.

21:28.060 --> 21:30.220
Okay. Yeah.

21:34.180 --> 21:35.620
Maybe you should speak to Arquette.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.100
Who's Arquette?

21:56.220 --> 21:59.420
So, you must be Koinanchey?

21:59.500 --> 22:02.620
Koinange. Folks call me Stripe.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.220
Why would they call you that?

22:05.300 --> 22:07.780
Couldn't pronounce Koinange either,
I guess.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.500
-That's funny.
-Thank you.

22:12.580 --> 22:14.300
At ease, son. Sit down.

22:19.180 --> 22:21.500
So you recently logged your first kills?

22:21.580 --> 22:23.420
-Two roaches?
-Uh-huh.

22:24.340 --> 22:27.060
First time out. It's impressive.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.340
Yeah, I guess.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.180
So what happened?

22:35.340 --> 22:37.500
-What, with the kills?
-Mm-hmm.

22:37.580 --> 22:40.820
Oh. I'm in this, uh... farmhouse.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.500
There's this, like,
hidden room or something.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.940
We go in and there they are.

22:49.020 --> 22:52.340
First one, I just... It was automatic.
Just pop-pop, you know?

22:53.460 --> 22:55.780
Right. Just like in training.

22:55.860 --> 22:58.740
Yeah, just like that, yeah. Yeah.

23:01.860 --> 23:04.980
-And the second?
-I mean, he was on the ground with me.

23:05.060 --> 23:06.300
He?

23:07.220 --> 23:08.300
It was a he.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.860
Oh.

23:10.940 --> 23:13.380
So, this was close quarters then?

23:14.460 --> 23:16.780
Yeah, he's on top of me.
Struggling, I mean...

23:16.860 --> 23:18.740
I couldn't reach my rifle
so I had to stick him.

23:18.820 --> 23:22.420
Stick it. With my knife.

23:23.180 --> 23:25.780
And how did that... feel?

23:27.460 --> 23:30.260
-What, like...?
-Emotionally.

23:33.580 --> 23:38.420
I didn't. I mean, it was quick.
It was self-protection.

23:41.780 --> 23:45.140
I guess all I felt was, you know, relief.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.340
-Just relief?
-Uh-huh.

23:49.420 --> 23:52.100
It's not unusual to experience
other feelings too.

23:53.660 --> 23:57.660
A moment of euphoria even.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.180
Yeah, I guess.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.780
I don't know,
I thought maybe I'd feel...

24:02.660 --> 24:04.100
I don't know.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.860
-Something else?
-Yeah, like...

24:06.940 --> 24:10.900
Regret. Something like that,
but that just wasn't there.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.060
Hmm.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.380
So you'd do it again?

24:16.060 --> 24:18.060
Yeah, sure.

24:18.140 --> 24:21.820
So... why are you here?

24:21.900 --> 24:23.500
I don't know. I mean...

24:25.700 --> 24:26.980
I had a few weird moments.

24:27.540 --> 24:29.900
My Mass looked like it was glitching out.

24:29.980 --> 24:33.940
But your implants,
I mean, they passed every diagnostic.

24:34.020 --> 24:36.500
-There is nothing wrong with that?
-Yeah, they said it's fine.

24:37.580 --> 24:40.140
I don't know, I think I just...

24:44.420 --> 24:45.620
Felt like something was up with it.

24:46.420 --> 24:48.580
-But there's not.
-No.

24:53.900 --> 24:57.860
You did a big thing.
You should be proud of yourself.

25:00.420 --> 25:01.220
Okay?

25:03.220 --> 25:04.020
It'll pass.

25:07.860 --> 25:09.820
Let's get you a good sleep tonight, huh?

25:14.220 --> 25:15.900
A real good sleep.

25:40.820 --> 25:42.580
Fuck me.

28:36.220 --> 28:38.420
Way to go, fuck fingers.

28:40.420 --> 28:43.660
It seems Heidekker didn't stay silent
too long once we got to work on him.

28:43.740 --> 28:46.060
He's given up a location, someplace
the roaches have been scavenging.

28:46.140 --> 28:47.380
Well, all right.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.540
It's a housing project
that's been empty since the war.

28:49.620 --> 28:50.700
It's not far from here.

28:50.780 --> 28:52.900
So control wants us to do recon
before we go back to base.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.420
Can we hurry it up here?

29:05.700 --> 29:07.980
We ought to burn the whole forest down,
huh?

29:08.940 --> 29:10.820
Give those roaches nowhere to run.

29:28.740 --> 29:29.820
Okay, you see that?

29:32.060 --> 29:33.660
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

29:36.180 --> 29:37.740
And there are some cables.

29:40.220 --> 29:43.500
-There's got to be roaches leaching power.
-Why here?

29:48.100 --> 29:49.180
Christ knows.

29:53.940 --> 29:54.940
All right.

29:56.780 --> 29:57.820
Better dial it in.

30:04.980 --> 30:06.380
Control. This is Medina.

30:06.940 --> 30:09.700
Positive ID. Signs of activity here
at the housing project location.

30:11.580 --> 30:16.700
Sighted one solar panel, looks
recently wiped clean and some cabling.

30:19.060 --> 30:21.380
Roger so far.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.220
-You all right there?
-Smell the grass.

30:30.780 --> 30:32.180
We can't usually smell nothing.

30:33.140 --> 30:35.700
- You ever noticed that?
- No, I never noticed that.

30:35.780 --> 30:36.820
Requesting course of action.

30:39.740 --> 30:41.620
Didn't read. Please repeat.

30:45.020 --> 30:46.020
Okay.

30:46.980 --> 30:49.180
Control says we should fall back
and await comm--

30:49.260 --> 30:50.820
Shit!

30:55.140 --> 30:56.420
Medina.

31:02.340 --> 31:04.220
Oh!

31:04.300 --> 31:05.780
Medina.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.580
Stripe, get back! She's dead. Come on!

31:12.620 --> 31:15.460
Okay. Ready? Cover me.

31:20.460 --> 31:21.940
Rai! Rai, come on.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.540
Okay.

31:32.660 --> 31:36.420
Oh, fucking roach got a rifle.
Jesus Christ.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.660
Fuck. Piece of shit.

31:43.020 --> 31:44.580
Okay, Stripe.

31:45.940 --> 31:48.100
Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude.

31:48.180 --> 31:51.500
He fired six shots.
His rifle looks old, bolt action.

31:51.580 --> 31:54.820
-Should take him ten seconds to reload.
-We go in?

31:54.900 --> 31:56.300
We go in and take him out.
Are you with me?

31:56.860 --> 31:58.420
-I'm with you.
-Let's go!

31:58.500 --> 32:00.620
Follow me!

32:08.580 --> 32:12.060
Ready? Okay, three, two, one. Cover me.

32:28.900 --> 32:31.220
Come on, man! What the fuck?

33:13.460 --> 33:14.740
What the fuck is this shit?

33:18.700 --> 33:19.500
Let's go.

33:23.260 --> 33:24.060
Stripe!

33:42.420 --> 33:45.060
Whoa, whoa! It's okay. Hey. Hey.

33:45.140 --> 33:48.140
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

33:48.220 --> 33:52.180
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

33:52.260 --> 33:54.260
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

33:54.340 --> 33:56.980
Go on, get out of here. Go on.

33:57.060 --> 33:59.500
It's not safe. There's roaches here.

34:02.060 --> 34:02.940
Go on. Get.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.620
Come on!

34:21.540 --> 34:23.980
- Rai, what did you do?
- Shut up! Come on!

34:24.060 --> 34:25.020
What did you do, Rai?

34:52.620 --> 34:53.700
Got ya.

35:11.740 --> 35:12.820
Rai!

36:06.260 --> 36:08.300
No!

36:08.380 --> 36:10.220
-Run!
-What the fuck are you doing?

36:10.300 --> 36:13.340
- You're killing them!
- They're roaches!

36:13.940 --> 36:17.140
You're fucking killing them, Rai!
Fuck you!

36:17.220 --> 36:19.700
What the fuck's wrong with you, man?
You got some blown shit.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.660
-Pull it together!
-No.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.820
Are you all right?

36:54.700 --> 36:56.900
You gotta get out of here. Come on.

36:58.580 --> 36:59.820
Come on!

37:28.420 --> 37:29.700
Fuck!

37:46.300 --> 37:47.380
You better run.

38:00.860 --> 38:03.900
Shh. Shh.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.300
Here.

40:25.420 --> 40:26.420
I'm all right.

40:53.180 --> 40:55.300
You see me as I am.

40:58.980 --> 40:59.820
Of course I see you.

41:02.900 --> 41:03.940
You don't see roach?

41:05.340 --> 41:06.820
You ain't a roach.

41:08.660 --> 41:09.780
Roaches is all...

41:11.660 --> 41:12.860
Fucked up?

41:15.380 --> 41:16.540
Roaches don't speak.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.860
You just can't hear us.

41:22.100 --> 41:26.540
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Your implants. Your army implants.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.300
The Mass system?

41:29.140 --> 41:31.700
They put it in your head to help you fight,

41:31.780 --> 41:34.740
and when it works,
you see us as something other.

41:38.100 --> 41:42.900
One of us, Luka,
was making a... a machine.

41:44.020 --> 41:47.420
Light flashes.
Said it can interfere with the implant.

41:49.420 --> 41:50.860
You're roaches?

41:54.700 --> 41:56.100
But I've seen roaches.

41:57.620 --> 42:00.940
I've seen them, they're fucking...
They're like, uh...

42:01.580 --> 42:04.300
-Animals?
-No, they're monsters. I've seen them.

42:04.380 --> 42:06.380
The implant made you see this.

42:44.980 --> 42:47.820
Fuck. The villagers... Huh?

42:49.620 --> 42:55.020
The locals, they... they ain't army.
They got no Mass in their heads.

42:55.100 --> 42:56.660
They're scared of the roaches.

42:57.580 --> 42:59.860
-They hate the fucking things.
-Everybody hates us.

42:59.940 --> 43:02.500
Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?

43:03.620 --> 43:06.340
The fucking civs, when they look
at a roach, what do they see?

43:06.420 --> 43:08.140
What you see now.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.340
They hate all the same
because it's what they've been told.

43:40.860 --> 43:42.260
Ten years ago, it began.

43:42.820 --> 43:43.780
Post-war.

43:44.700 --> 43:48.860
First, the screening programme,
the DNA checks,

43:48.940 --> 43:52.340
then the register,
the emergency measures.

43:53.460 --> 43:57.300
And soon everyone calls us creatures.
Filthy creatures.

43:58.220 --> 44:01.300
Every voice. The TV. The computer.

44:01.380 --> 44:03.980
Say we have... we have sickness in us.

44:05.140 --> 44:07.980
We have weakness. It's in our blood.

44:08.060 --> 44:10.900
They say that our blood cannot go on.

44:12.060 --> 44:13.140
That we cannot go on.

44:19.060 --> 44:20.540
My name was Catarina.

44:23.980 --> 44:24.980
He was Alec.

44:28.420 --> 44:29.780
Now we're just roach.

45:13.140 --> 45:14.620
But now...

45:15.940 --> 45:17.180
Now you see me.

45:27.780 --> 45:28.900
Now you see me.

45:43.580 --> 45:44.820
Rai?

45:47.380 --> 45:49.140
Rai, no!

46:02.980 --> 46:04.140
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.

46:06.020 --> 46:08.700
-None of it's true, Rai.
-What the fuck got you?

46:11.420 --> 46:13.020
None of it's true.

46:16.060 --> 46:17.980
Fuck you.

46:20.100 --> 46:23.100
Get up. Back against the wall.

46:25.060 --> 46:26.060
Get up!

46:27.420 --> 46:28.820
You want me to come in there?

46:28.900 --> 46:31.580
It's all right. I can just talk to him.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.540
Thank you, Briley.

46:51.780 --> 46:52.900
Stripe.

46:55.500 --> 46:59.500
We owe you an apology.
We didn't spot the fault in your Mass.

47:00.980 --> 47:02.340
I got you a coffee.

47:25.780 --> 47:30.420
The device you found in the farmhouse,
you mentioned it to the doctor.

47:36.180 --> 47:37.420
Is this the thing?

47:39.700 --> 47:42.700
We found it on an old block
that you and Raiman were searching.

47:42.780 --> 47:46.260
Looks like they reverse engineered it
from some of our drone parts and so on.

47:48.780 --> 47:53.580
The light here transmits a code.
It's like a virus.

47:53.660 --> 47:56.700
It burrows into your Mass,
trying to shut it down from within.

47:58.620 --> 48:01.660
I tell you, those roaches
are getting more ingenious

48:01.740 --> 48:02.980
than we give them credit for.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.420
The whole thing is a lie.

48:08.620 --> 48:10.300
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

48:10.860 --> 48:11.700
Roaches.

48:13.540 --> 48:14.740
They look just like us.

48:15.860 --> 48:17.020
Of course they do.

48:19.660 --> 48:21.060
That's why they're so dangerous.

48:24.060 --> 48:27.300
Humans.
You know, we give ourselves a bad rap,

48:27.380 --> 48:30.380
but we're genuinely empathetic
as a species.

48:30.460 --> 48:34.460
I mean, we don't actually really want
to kill each other.

48:35.180 --> 48:36.460
Which is a good thing.

48:38.180 --> 48:41.060
Until your future depends
on wiping out the enemy.

48:44.620 --> 48:46.380
Come on, sit down.

48:58.460 --> 49:00.740
I don't know how much history
you studied in school.

49:01.700 --> 49:05.380
Many years ago,
I'm talking early 20th century,

49:06.020 --> 49:08.420
most soldiers
didn't even fire their weapons.

49:09.500 --> 49:13.140
Or if they did, they would just aim
over the heads of the enemies.

49:13.900 --> 49:15.460
They did it on purpose.

49:17.060 --> 49:19.820
British Army. World War I.

49:19.900 --> 49:22.340
The brigadier,
he'd walk the line with a stick

49:22.420 --> 49:25.300
and he'd whack his men
in order to get them to shoot.

49:26.460 --> 49:29.340
Even in World War II, in a firefight,

49:29.420 --> 49:32.420
only 15%, 20% of the men
would pull the trigger.

49:33.660 --> 49:37.900
The fate of the world at stake
and only 15% of them fired.

49:37.980 --> 49:39.580
Now what does that tell you?

49:41.420 --> 49:44.860
It tells me that that war
would have been over a whole lot quicker

49:44.940 --> 49:47.340
had the military got its shit together.

49:48.740 --> 49:49.820
So we adapted.

49:50.820 --> 49:54.060
Better training. Better conditioning.

49:54.820 --> 49:56.660
Then comes the Vietnam War,

49:56.740 --> 49:58.620
and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.

49:59.700 --> 50:03.220
Lot of bullets flying.
The kills were still low.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.060
Plus the guys who did get a kill,

50:05.140 --> 50:08.020
well, most of them came back
all messed up in the head.

50:10.740 --> 50:13.900
And that's pretty much how things stayed
until Mass came along.

50:15.020 --> 50:20.060
You see, Mass...
Well, that's the ultimate military weapon.

50:20.820 --> 50:22.540
It helps you with your intel.

50:23.260 --> 50:27.300
Your targeting. Your comms.
Your conditioning.

50:29.340 --> 50:34.580
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger
when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

50:36.300 --> 50:40.620
It's not just your eyes, though.
Takes care of your other senses, too.

50:40.700 --> 50:42.540
You don't hear the shrieks.

50:43.620 --> 50:45.500
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

50:47.820 --> 50:49.220
They're human beings.

50:52.220 --> 50:55.220
Do you have any idea the amount of shit
that's in their DNA?

50:56.860 --> 50:59.180
Higher rates of cancer.

50:59.260 --> 51:04.380
Muscular dystrophy.
MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

51:04.460 --> 51:07.620
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

51:08.620 --> 51:09.740
It's all there.

51:11.100 --> 51:12.820
The screening shows it.

51:14.700 --> 51:17.140
Is that what you want
for the next generation?

51:18.980 --> 51:21.100
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

51:21.780 --> 51:23.380
The villagers won't do it.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.740
The folks back home won't do it.

51:26.820 --> 51:28.260
They don't have Mass.

51:30.140 --> 51:32.300
Mass lets you do it.

51:34.980 --> 51:36.180
You.

51:37.180 --> 51:39.540
You're protecting the bloodline.

51:40.820 --> 51:42.660
And that, my friend, is an honour.

51:44.500 --> 51:45.900
There's no honour here.

51:47.780 --> 51:48.900
It's just killing.

51:50.940 --> 51:54.380
-Lying and killing.
-No one lied to you.

51:56.340 --> 51:58.740
You knew all of this. All along.

51:58.820 --> 52:00.420
What are you talking about?

52:00.500 --> 52:03.100
You agreed
to have your Mass implant put in.

52:03.180 --> 52:07.060
Set up. Every soldier does.

52:07.140 --> 52:11.580
We can't just embed it and feed you
a dream. Your mind would reject it.

52:11.660 --> 52:14.940
You have to accept it. Willingly.

52:17.700 --> 52:18.940
It's exactly what you did.

52:25.860 --> 52:27.820
<i> So you see the terms</i>
<i>and conditions there?</i>

52:27.900 --> 52:29.660
<i>Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man.</i>

52:29.740 --> 52:30.540
What is that?

52:31.420 --> 52:35.180
That's your consent video.
From when you signed up six months ago.

52:35.260 --> 52:39.660
<i> Basically, it says you agree</i>
<i>to Mass implant activation.</i>

52:39.740 --> 52:42.260
-I didn't do this.
-Yes, you did.

52:42.340 --> 52:45.700
- <i> Works kind of like hypnosis.</i>
<i>- Yeah, all right.</i>

52:45.780 --> 52:48.060
<i> Part of what you're agreeing to</i>
<i>is not realising</i>

52:48.140 --> 52:49.540
<i>you've been put in this state.</i>

52:49.620 --> 52:51.940
<i>If you follow me.</i>
<i>You won't recall this conversation.</i>

52:52.020 --> 52:53.180
<i>That's kind of funny, man.</i>

52:53.740 --> 52:54.780
Turn it off.

52:54.860 --> 52:58.140
- <i> So for you to register consent...</i>
- Turn it off, man.

52:58.220 --> 52:59.900
<i>I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.</i>

53:00.780 --> 53:03.260
<i>- Right here?</i>
<i>-  Yes, please.</i>

53:05.940 --> 53:07.060
<i>That's dope.</i>

53:09.660 --> 53:10.940
I didn't do that!

53:12.780 --> 53:15.700
-I don't remember that!
-Just like the man said.

53:20.940 --> 53:23.340
-I know you're upset.
-Fuck you!

53:29.100 --> 53:32.220
-What's happening?
-We control what you see, Stripe.

53:34.740 --> 53:37.420
-I can't see nothing.
-Because we control it.

53:41.860 --> 53:43.020
Give me my fucking eyes back.

53:44.380 --> 53:47.700
-Let me lay out your options.
-Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

53:47.780 --> 53:50.980
Let me lay out your options!

53:55.780 --> 53:59.180
Option one,
you agree to have your Mass reset.

54:01.100 --> 54:03.340
All the recollections
of the past few days,

54:03.420 --> 54:06.700
including this conversation, erased.

54:07.260 --> 54:08.180
No way.

54:09.860 --> 54:12.100
Option two's incarceration.

54:12.180 --> 54:14.140
-I'd advise you to consider.
-Fuck you!

54:14.820 --> 54:15.900
Mass is a friend.

54:16.820 --> 54:21.140
Without it, you will remember
everything that you did.

54:21.220 --> 54:23.020
I ain't having this Mass shit.

54:23.940 --> 54:24.940
No more. No way.

54:26.860 --> 54:28.140
Okay.

54:30.300 --> 54:31.100
Well...

54:33.340 --> 54:35.420
Maybe you should see
what life would be like without it.

54:40.340 --> 54:41.900
What's happening?

54:43.540 --> 54:44.540
Where am I?

54:45.420 --> 54:48.860
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.

54:55.740 --> 54:59.580
I have it all logged, Stripe.
We can feed you everything that you did.

55:04.820 --> 55:06.060
Hey, no, no, no. No.

55:06.620 --> 55:10.140
Please! Please don't shoot. Please!
Please! Please don't shoot.

55:10.780 --> 55:12.260
-Please! Please!
-No! No!

55:12.340 --> 55:13.900
No. Make it stop.

55:13.980 --> 55:16.940
No! Please.

55:17.020 --> 55:17.900
Make it stop!

55:17.980 --> 55:20.940
Please!

55:22.620 --> 55:24.900
No! No!

55:29.380 --> 55:32.180
No!

55:43.260 --> 55:45.540
Fuck off! Stop it!

55:50.500 --> 55:53.900
No!

55:57.820 --> 56:02.420
You'll see and smell and feel it all.

56:04.220 --> 56:05.460
Is this what you want?

56:07.340 --> 56:11.100
On a loop? In a cell all alone?

56:30.340 --> 56:31.900
We can make that go away.

56:33.660 --> 56:35.660
This conversation goes away too.

56:36.860 --> 56:37.940
All of it.

56:39.660 --> 56:41.220
But you gotta say the word.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.380
Just say the word, Stripe.

56:47.980 --> 56:49.260
And it all goes away.

56:58.900 --> 57:00.540
Just say the word.
