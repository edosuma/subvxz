00:01.626 --> 00:04.171
Vince, I'd love another
shot at working together.

00:04.337 --> 00:07.738
I would hack off my penis
before would ever allow you

00:07.863 --> 00:09.572
<i>to work with Carl Ertz again.</i>

00:09.697 --> 00:11.511
We're taking avion to the next level.

00:11.677 --> 00:13.472
You no longer need to work.

00:13.638 --> 00:16.183
Did Alex know?
Is this why she's been dodging my calls?

00:16.349 --> 00:18.942
- You want to do shots?
- What do you usually do on dates?

00:19.067 --> 00:22.064
Bottom line is they're gonna
fire you if you do this.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.900
- What, are you gonna go against me, Drama?
- I got you this job.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.915
I'm feeling lonely and I didn't know
who else to call.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.030
- Did you take something today?
- No.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.653
- Are you high?
- Yeah, I'm fucking high.

00:32.778 --> 00:35.327
Dice couldn't be convinced to be here,
so it's the only move.

00:35.493 --> 00:36.745
Oh!

00:36.911 --> 00:38.538
Open the door.
Seriously, come on.

00:38.704 --> 00:39.998
<i>I can't leave you like this.</i>

00:40.164 --> 00:42.255

I can't believe he killed himself.

02:03.829 --> 02:05.205
I can't believe I saw brains.

02:05.330 --> 02:07.674
And he wouldn't come out.
I told him he was being selfish.

02:07.799 --> 02:09.475
That's the last thing he heard.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.243
- You can't blame yourself, Vince.
- Seriously, bro,

02:12.368 --> 02:15.145
- the guy was a mess.
- Even more so now.

02:15.270 --> 02:17.596
Hey, what do brains look like?

02:17.762 --> 02:19.782
- Jesus.
- What? I'm curious.

02:19.907 --> 02:20.765
They're gross.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.601
They're like mashed-up
spaghetti and meatballs.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.519
They used koshers and cottage cheese

02:25.644 --> 02:27.124
when I got shot in the head
in "New York Undercover."

02:27.249 --> 02:28.321
Did it look real?

02:28.446 --> 02:29.399
Yeah, I thought it did.

02:29.565 --> 02:32.457
I'll now forever know
what looks real and what don't.

02:32.582 --> 02:34.925
- I'll never get it out of my head.
- Spaghetti and meatballs?

02:35.050 --> 02:37.593
No, brains, Scott!
Carl Ertz's fucking brains!

02:37.718 --> 02:39.728
- Guys, stop, please.
- Seriously. Please.

02:39.853 --> 02:42.363
Hey Vince, we're
just about done here.

02:42.488 --> 02:43.731
Is there anything else we can do?

02:43.856 --> 02:45.598
Yeah, I'm gonna need you and your buddy
to come down

02:45.723 --> 02:47.250
to the station and give
an official statement.

02:47.416 --> 02:49.492
Okay, no problem.

02:50.727 --> 02:52.839
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah yeah.

02:53.005 --> 02:55.297
Okay.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.429
You're not saying shit
till you guys lawyer up.

02:59.595 --> 02:59.910
Relax.

03:00.035 --> 03:02.480
No, don't tell me to relax.
You know what they're gonna do?

03:02.605 --> 03:04.081
They're gonna put you
guys in separate rooms,

03:04.206 --> 03:05.750
shine bright lights in your faces and see

03:05.875 --> 03:07.952
- if your stories match up.
- Our stories are gonna match up.

03:08.077 --> 03:10.120
- We've got nothing to hide.
- Seriously, Johnny, we didn't do anything.

03:10.245 --> 03:12.989
- The cops did find coke in there, Vince.
- So? I didn't touch it.

03:13.114 --> 03:14.790
- I was with him. He didn't touch it.
- It doesn't matter.

03:14.915 --> 03:16.392
- You're on probation.
- Lawyer up.

03:16.517 --> 03:19.827
- I'm gonna call Jim Lefkowitz.
- Go on, call Shauna too.

03:19.952 --> 03:21.117
Get out from this thing.

03:21.283 --> 03:22.863
- Vince, look this way.
- Too late for that.

03:22.988 --> 03:25.665
- "TMZ" is already out in front of it.
- Great.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.301
Precinct should be fun.

03:28.426 --> 03:31.895
- How's my hair look?
- Look here, look here.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.838
I have never kept
my Berry off this long.

03:35.963 --> 03:38.677
- Not for anyone.
- Aha, neither have I.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.975
What? I bet I have more missed emails
and voicemails

03:42.100 --> 03:43.543
- than you do.
- Really?

03:43.668 --> 03:46.880
- I run a studio, Ari.
- I run a worldwide talent agency

03:47.005 --> 03:51.017
- with 645 employees.
- Mmm.

03:51.142 --> 03:55.121
- Well, do you wanna bet?
- Bet? What do you have to bet?

03:55.246 --> 03:58.624
Do you wanna double Vince's salary
on "Air-Walker"?

03:58.749 --> 04:01.533
Lose the back end for Taylor Lautner
on "Cave Dwellers."

04:01.699 --> 04:03.928
- Can't do it.
- It's a cameo.

04:04.053 --> 04:06.830
He's working for three days.
He doesn't deserve back-end gross.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.232
Let's just bet sex.

04:09.498 --> 04:11.835
- Oh, what do I win?

04:12.001 --> 04:13.036
Funny.

04:13.161 --> 04:15.738
Okay. Um,

04:16.005 --> 04:19.741
I have 132 emails and 16 voicemails.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.477
I have 420 emails
and my voicemail is full.

04:22.602 --> 04:25.307
- Come on.
- It's a lot even for me.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.447
- Well, you wanna start rolling calls?
- Not really.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.979
Maybe we just leave it off and we stay
in bed the rest of the day.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.019
- Aw, you would never do that.
- Mm.

04:34.144 --> 04:35.887
Actually if I didn't have therapy,
I swear I would.

04:36.012 --> 04:38.823
- You to therapy?
- Yes, I do. You surprised?

04:38.948 --> 04:42.059
- I'm shocked.
- It's couples therapy, actually.

04:42.184 --> 04:44.061
Wow.

04:44.186 --> 04:47.496
Now I'm even more shocked.
Why are you going to couples therapy?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.632
When your marriage is in trouble,
that's what you do.

04:49.955 --> 04:53.902
Well, I think your marriage is
long past trouble.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.104
Yeah.

04:56.229 --> 04:59.708
- Ah, it's okay. You can answer it.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.510
- So can you.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.245
Huh, thank you.

05:04.370 --> 05:07.380
- Ahem.
- Hello.

05:07.505 --> 05:10.560
- What?
- Holy shit!

05:17.011 --> 05:19.188
Out of my way, you parasites.
Jesus Christ, move!

05:19.313 --> 05:21.190
Vincent, don't say
a fucking word to anybody!

05:21.315 --> 05:23.073
- Hi, Shauna.
- How are you doing, baby? Okay?

05:23.239 --> 05:24.828
- I'm okay.
- I saw brains.

05:24.953 --> 05:25.829
Vinnie, how are you doing?

05:25.954 --> 05:27.431
Sorry I missed your call.
I was in a meeting.

05:27.556 --> 05:29.466
- It's okay. I'm fine, Ari.
- I saw brains.

05:29.591 --> 05:31.217
That's great.
I'm guessing they weren't Drama's.

05:31.342 --> 05:32.300
Come on, let him through.

05:32.425 --> 05:33.098
He's not answering anything.

05:33.223 --> 05:34.172
Your lawyer's inside, Vince.

05:34.297 --> 05:37.208
Come on, let's go.
Get that fucking camera out of my face!

05:37.333 --> 05:38.142
Prick!

05:38.420 --> 05:40.811
Hey, it's me, yeah.
I nee--

05:40.936 --> 05:44.547
I need to push therapy to 12:15.
Can you call me back when you can?

05:44.672 --> 05:46.615
- Therapy?
- Yeah, couples therapy.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.149
- I thought you were divorced.
- Separated.

05:48.274 --> 05:49.918
I thought she was seeing Bobby Flay.

05:50.043 --> 05:51.686
- Who told you that?
- Huh, everyone.

05:51.811 --> 05:55.255
So you just be straightforward and honest
and then we should be out of here soon.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.723
- Hey, Ari.
- Okay okay.

05:56.848 --> 05:59.427
Only issue is because there were drugs
on the premises,

05:59.552 --> 06:01.496
I'm sure your P.O. is gonna
want a drug test.

06:01.621 --> 06:03.164
- Drug test?
- Yeah.

06:03.289 --> 06:05.066
That's okay.
He didn't do any drugs.

06:05.191 --> 06:08.219
- That's good. And that's true?
- I didn't touch anything in this house.

06:08.344 --> 06:10.874
Okay, good. Well, I'll let you know
what the P.O. says as soon as I hear.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.455
Hey Jim, how long do you think
it's gonna take?

06:12.621 --> 06:14.540
- What, do you have to be somewhere, Ari?
- Marriage therapy.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.252
- Shut the fuck up, Shauna.
- Ari, go.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.942
- I'm fine. Seriously.
- Are you sure?

06:19.067 --> 06:20.809
- Yeah. Take care of your family.
- Thanks, buddy.

06:21.088 --> 06:22.477
- I'll call you after.
- I'll call you.

06:22.602 --> 06:24.300
- Thanks.
- Hey, guys, come with us.

06:24.466 --> 06:25.969
We're gonna try to get you out of here
as fast as possible.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.449
- You're not gonna separate them, right?
- Why would I?

06:28.574 --> 06:32.485
Don'mind him. He's seen way
too many episodes of "Law & Order."

06:32.610 --> 06:34.811
Been on more than I've seen,
actually.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.190
- Jim, what do I do?
- Just relax and tell the truth.

06:37.315 --> 06:39.225
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah. Don't throw up.

06:39.350 --> 06:42.228
- Why would he throw up?
- Guy's got a weak constitution.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.279
If he has to relive the carnage,
who knows?

06:44.445 --> 06:47.833
- No, he's right. I might throw up.
- I thought you guys were from the hood.

06:47.958 --> 06:49.868
- His mother and auntie coddled him.

06:49.993 --> 06:54.606
- All right, Turtle. Let's go.
- You'll be all right, guys. Just relax.

06:54.872 --> 06:58.966
- Coffee?
- Sure.

07:04.271 --> 07:06.481
- You okay?
- Not really.

07:06.606 --> 07:07.916
Hey, you need to get some sleep.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.618
I actually need to talk to you.

07:09.743 --> 07:11.153
- Okay.
- Just give me a second.

07:11.278 --> 07:13.889
I'm trying to figure out
how we're gonna have a conversation

07:14.014 --> 07:15.991
- without getting into a fight.
- Ha, what conversation?

07:16.116 --> 07:17.380
Why would we have a fight?

07:17.505 --> 07:18.928
Because you like to tell me
what I've done wrong.

07:19.053 --> 07:20.596
- You don't like to fix things.
- Really?

07:20.721 --> 07:22.688
You know what?
Pull over here.

07:28.627 --> 07:31.284
You know what my first thought was
when this was going on?

07:31.450 --> 07:34.037
"Oh fuck, what's E gonna say?"

07:34.203 --> 07:36.376
The guy shoots himself
two feet from me

07:36.501 --> 07:38.945
and I'm thinking you're gonna tell me
I shouldn't have been there.

07:39.070 --> 07:40.947
I mean, how fucked is that?!

07:41.072 --> 07:43.463
- You're like a nagging mom.
- Yeah, maybe you need that.

07:43.629 --> 07:44.784
- Say it.
- Say what?

07:44.909 --> 07:47.686
- Say I told you so.
- I didn't tell you anything.

07:47.811 --> 07:49.587
Because I didn't know
you were fucking going there,

07:49.712 --> 07:52.597
because you didn't fucking tell me.
Now what the fuck are we talking about?

07:52.763 --> 07:55.359
E, I need my friend right now,
not a lecture.

07:55.484 --> 07:56.627
- Okay.
- Promise?

07:56.752 --> 07:59.020
- I promise.
- I smoked a joint last week.

07:59.186 --> 08:00.763
Jesus.

08:00.888 --> 08:04.333
I needed to do it.
I've been in rehab and a lot of it was good,

08:04.458 --> 08:06.835
but a lot of it was them telling me,
"you're an addict

08:06.960 --> 08:09.771
and you can never ever
do this or that ever again."

08:09.896 --> 08:13.007
And I know how this is gonna sound.

08:13.132 --> 08:15.161
I don't think I'm an addict.

08:15.327 --> 08:17.579
And I needed to prove it
to myself and I did.

08:17.704 --> 08:19.981
I took a couple of puffs,
none of you even knew about it

08:20.106 --> 08:21.783
and I haven't thought about it since.

08:21.908 --> 08:23.685
I don't think an addict can do that.

08:23.810 --> 08:25.987
- Okay.
- So now what?

08:26.112 --> 08:27.522
E, I can't take a drug test.

08:27.647 --> 08:29.890
I don't know what they'll do to me
if I test positive.

08:30.015 --> 08:31.659
Relax.
We'll figure it out.

08:31.784 --> 08:33.727
- Figure what out?
- I don't know, all right?

08:33.852 --> 08:36.563
But I'm not gonna lecture you again.
But from here on in, I need to know everything

08:36.688 --> 08:39.332
that you're thinking and everything
that you're doing or I'm gone.

08:39.457 --> 08:41.833
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, I do. But what do we do?

08:41.958 --> 08:44.607
- How much did you smoke?
- Two puffs, nothing.

08:44.773 --> 08:46.539
- Maybe it's out of your system.
- How do we find out?

08:46.664 --> 08:49.608
We'll call the guys, pick up a couple of
home tests and we'll go from there.

08:49.733 --> 08:52.568
Okay.
Thanks.

08:58.573 --> 09:01.450
I think you need to keep your words
simple and short,

09:01.575 --> 09:05.003
express how you feel and don't let it
escalate.

09:05.169 --> 09:08.214
Well, my blood pressure is escalating
every minute I sit here waiting.

09:08.380 --> 09:09.560
But we could still talk
about just you.

09:09.685 --> 09:12.896
- I don't want to talk about me.
- I'm sorry.

09:13.021 --> 09:14.931
Got here as fast as I could.

09:15.056 --> 09:18.333
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.926
What'd I miss?

09:24.029 --> 09:25.806
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

09:25.931 --> 09:27.307
What?!
Someone tell me.

09:27.432 --> 09:28.985
I think your wife should tell you.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.476
Please tell me.

09:30.601 --> 09:33.378
How could you be
30 minutes late today?!

09:33.503 --> 09:36.080
I'm not 30 minutes late.
I'm four minutes late.

09:36.205 --> 09:38.817
- I called you and told you to push it back.
- I was already here

09:38.942 --> 09:40.886
- when you called.
- Well, I-- I didn't know--

09:41.011 --> 09:42.821
yeah, well, you also called me and told me
to push it

09:42.946 --> 09:45.210
like I was your secretary and you wanted me
to change a meeting.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.235
I didn't mean to--

09:46.360 --> 09:48.359
How many times
have you left me sitting here...

09:48.484 --> 09:52.263
When it was important
to me for us to be here?

09:52.388 --> 09:56.101
And now <i>you</i> want me to be here.
That's what you asked for.

09:56.226 --> 09:58.737
- Is that what you asked for?
- I-it is.

09:58.862 --> 10:01.440
But listen, do you know what
happened to me today?

10:01.565 --> 10:04.043
Ari, I don't care
what happened to you today.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.145
Well, that's nice.
Is that nice?

10:06.270 --> 10:07.880
She's trying to express a feeling.

10:08.005 --> 10:10.850
That she doesn't care
what happened to me today.

10:10.975 --> 10:14.321
We've been coming here for years
and always something happens.

10:14.446 --> 10:17.192
- I can explain this.
- I don't want you to explain.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.430
You see that, doc?
Now that she's seeing someone,

10:20.555 --> 10:21.324
my life is unimportant.

10:21.449 --> 10:23.957
I didn't say that,
but my life is equally important.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.403
- Do you believe that?
- Equally?

10:26.528 --> 10:29.462
Of course he doesn't believe that.
I was never put first.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.909
So Bobby Flay who has as many housewives
as chili peppers

10:32.034 --> 10:34.979
- puts you first. Is that where we're at?
- I'm not gonna go into this.

10:35.104 --> 10:37.782
You're in it. You're happy now
'cause you found someone new.

10:37.907 --> 10:40.553
And I guess now I'm happy
'cause I found someone new as well.

10:40.678 --> 10:42.892
Really?
You found someone new?

10:43.058 --> 10:45.144
- Is that shocking?
- He's just saying that.

10:45.310 --> 10:48.095
- Are you just saying that?
- What? You think that I can't find someone?

10:48.220 --> 10:50.430
- What is this, tit for tat?
- What's good for the goose...

10:50.555 --> 10:51.777
Well, I don't believe you.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.168
You don't believe
that I can find someone else?

10:54.293 --> 10:56.905
I think it's believable.
I just don't believe you.

10:57.030 --> 10:59.275
Well, why don't I send you
some pictures so you can put it up

10:59.400 --> 11:02.078
in one of Bobby Flay's restaurants?

11:02.244 --> 11:03.663
Oh, now where are you going?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.781
How many times has he left these
sessions in the middle?

11:05.906 --> 11:08.048
Well, it is my turn now.

11:08.173 --> 11:11.541
So you're just gonna walk out on me?!

11:12.675 --> 11:14.884
Bill this one to her.

11:15.174 --> 11:19.152
Okay, says here weed can stay in your
system for up to 90 days

11:19.277 --> 11:21.087
and sometimes as little as five days.

11:21.212 --> 11:23.220
- Depending on what?
- Every person is different.

11:23.345 --> 11:27.687
I can naturally secrete any substance
from my body in 36 hours or less.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.721
Ugh.
Says who?

11:28.846 --> 11:30.356
- I did it in high school.
- For what?

11:30.522 --> 11:31.923
I juiced for wrestling.

11:32.048 --> 11:34.823
- You were on the wrestling team?
- No, I didn't make it,

11:34.948 --> 11:37.030
but I loaded up for tryouts.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.958
My piss turned purple.
Is that good?

11:39.083 --> 11:41.726
I tried one at the store.
Mine turned purple too.

11:41.851 --> 11:43.194
- Not good.
- No, not good.

11:43.319 --> 11:47.598
- So now what?
- I got vinegar, distilled water and niacin.

11:47.723 --> 11:50.133
- For what?
- We gotta flush out your system.

11:50.258 --> 11:53.403
You drink three or four of these,
they'll barely be able to find blood in you.

11:53.528 --> 11:56.905
- He's gonna drink vinegar?
- Yeah, we're all gonna do it for solidarity.

11:57.030 --> 11:58.801
Whatever we've gotta do, Vin.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.608
I'm new to the team,
so maybe I'll just sip it.

12:00.733 --> 12:02.443
- Pussy.
- What's this?

12:02.568 --> 12:05.078
It's THC-removing hair cleanser.

12:05.203 --> 12:07.747
- In case they do a hair test.
- I got you razors too.

12:07.872 --> 12:10.083
I think you should shave your head and body
even after you use the wash.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.019
Shave my body?
Do you really think this is necessary?

12:12.144 --> 12:13.887
No, listen, the key to this thing

12:14.012 --> 12:15.923
is getting this drug test pushed back
as far as possible.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.391
I don't think there's anything
we can do about that.

12:17.516 --> 12:19.127
We have to try 'cause every day
it's more likely

12:19.252 --> 12:20.829
- to be out of his system.
- All right,

12:20.954 --> 12:22.797
- I'll make a call.
- I'm so fucked.

12:22.922 --> 12:24.660
No, Vin. Come on, drink this shit.

12:24.826 --> 12:26.568
- It could work.
- Seriously?

12:26.693 --> 12:28.636
It has worked, all right?
We'll all do it together.

12:28.761 --> 12:29.791
- Let's do it.
- Fine.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.627
All right.

12:32.793 --> 12:35.641
- Hmm,

12:35.766 --> 12:38.177
- I kind of like it.
- I can't do it.

12:38.302 --> 12:40.779
No no, come on, bro.
We have no choice.

12:40.904 --> 12:43.713
We drink one of these an hour
for however long we get.

12:43.838 --> 12:45.581
We get a few days,
we might have a real good chance.

12:45.706 --> 12:48.950
- All right, spoke to Lefkowitz.
- What'd he say?

12:49.075 --> 12:51.052
- 7:00.
- In the morning?

12:51.177 --> 12:52.587
- Tonight.
- What?!

12:52.712 --> 12:55.890
Wow wow, I'm so fucked.

12:56.015 --> 12:58.992
No, come on!
Let's drink like 100 of these.

12:59.117 --> 13:01.995
- You'll piss pure vinegar.
- Johnny, let it go. Forget it!

13:02.120 --> 13:04.931
- I have four hours.
- We gotta do something, Vin.

13:05.056 --> 13:08.200
- Take a drive.
- Do you want me to come with you?

13:08.325 --> 13:10.369
- No. I'm good.
- What about the press?

13:10.494 --> 13:11.727
Fuck 'em.

13:13.295 --> 13:16.373
- Was Carl Ertz depressed?

13:16.498 --> 13:19.309
- Yo, Billy, where you at?
- I'm at home. Are you okay?

13:19.434 --> 13:21.044
No. I need you.
It's important.

13:21.169 --> 13:24.104
- I see you in 10.
- Okay.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.087
Um, excuse me.

13:31.212 --> 13:33.122
You wanna take me out for dinner?

13:33.247 --> 13:35.290
- Is that strange?
- <i>Unexpected.</i>

13:35.415 --> 13:37.725
- <i>Guess therapy didn't go very well.</i>
- No.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.094
- Okay.
- I'll pick you up at 7:00.

13:40.219 --> 13:41.662
Maybe I should take my own car.

13:41.787 --> 13:44.331
We're going home together either way.
So it's up to you.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.833
Um,

13:46.958 --> 13:49.702
on a business note,

13:49.827 --> 13:53.572
you know, the news says that Vince
is gonna have to take a drug test.

13:53.697 --> 13:55.574
- Don't worry about that.
- <i>If he fails,</i>

13:55.699 --> 13:58.276
- we have a big problem, Ari.
- <i>He's not gonna fail.</i>

13:58.401 --> 14:00.744
Why don't you just worry
about what you're gonna wear tonight

14:00.869 --> 14:02.445
- and I'll worry about Vince?
- <i>Okay.</i>

14:02.570 --> 14:03.846
Okay.
I'll see you tonight.

14:03.971 --> 14:05.947
Bye.

14:06.219 --> 14:08.683
Okay.
Honey, just two seconds, please.

14:08.808 --> 14:11.886
Here's what's gonna happen, all right?

14:12.011 --> 14:13.821
They're gonna call your name,
you're gonna get up,

14:13.946 --> 14:16.256
while 50 waiting degenerates
whisper, "it's Vince Chase."

14:16.381 --> 14:18.592
An officer is gonna escort you
into the bathroom

14:18.717 --> 14:21.402
and hand you a sealed cup
and watch you open it and piss into it.

14:21.568 --> 14:22.961
How closely is he gonna watch?

14:23.236 --> 14:24.929
Close enough to identify
a freckle on your cock.

14:25.054 --> 14:28.498
Really?
And you think you guys' thing can fool him?

14:28.623 --> 14:29.798
I know it can.
I've done it.

14:29.923 --> 14:31.871
I fooled a girlfriend of mine
with it for a week.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.967
Seriously.

14:34.092 --> 14:35.735
I mean, are there any other options?

14:35.860 --> 14:37.710
With three hours to go?
No, none.

14:40.662 --> 14:41.704
Fuck it.
Let's do it.

14:41.829 --> 14:44.839
I don't feel right about this though,
Vince.

14:44.964 --> 14:46.907
- You did it for you and not me?
- You're not me,

14:47.032 --> 14:49.009
- you're Vince Chase.
- Billy, as long as it works.

14:49.134 --> 14:53.017
Of course it will work,
so long as you don't panic.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.346
- I don't panic.
- Or freeze.

14:55.471 --> 14:57.013
I don't freeze.
I don't panic.

14:57.138 --> 14:58.814
Then it will work.
But if we're gonna do it,

14:58.939 --> 15:01.584
we've gotta go now 'cause
it may take at least an hour to install.

15:01.709 --> 15:03.319
Install?

15:03.444 --> 15:06.821
Ari, you're so full of it.
I asked you where this was going

15:06.946 --> 15:09.591
and you said you still had things
to do with your life.

15:09.716 --> 15:11.660
I wish that I could be
so coldhearted and cool,

15:11.785 --> 15:14.121
but it was you in fact
that chose your career.

15:14.287 --> 15:16.234
Oh, maybe in <i>your</i> memory.

15:16.359 --> 15:19.304
You just don't wanna face the fact that
you passed up this good thing.

15:19.429 --> 15:22.312
Listen, you did pretty well with your life,
all right?

15:22.437 --> 15:24.946
Mm, yeah, except I'm 40 and single.

15:25.071 --> 15:27.250
You got the career and
the whole perfect family.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.552
Had the perfect family.

15:28.677 --> 15:32.139
Ah, the choices that we make.

15:32.305 --> 15:33.160
- Yeah.
- Ari.

15:33.285 --> 15:36.330
Look at this,
the world-famous chef Bobby Flay.

15:36.455 --> 15:37.932
- Hello, Dana.
- How are you, Bobby?

15:38.057 --> 15:40.769
- I'm good.
- I didn't know that you two knew each other.

15:40.894 --> 15:43.438
- You didn't use to date, did you?
- Ari, what are you doing here?

15:43.563 --> 15:44.580
I don't know what you mean.

15:44.705 --> 15:46.640
I'm on a date and
I'm at my favorite restaurant.

15:46.765 --> 15:49.410
- Wow, what's the problem?
- He'll have to explain that to you.

15:49.535 --> 15:50.977
Bobby, why don't you go
back to hiding in your kitchen

15:51.102 --> 15:52.445
before I shove a shiitake
mushroom up your ass?

15:52.570 --> 15:54.147
- <i>Hm, really?</i>
- Yeah.

15:54.272 --> 15:56.449
We'd go outside if I didn't think
that was sort of wrong.

15:56.574 --> 15:59.185
- Sort of?
- Asshole.

15:59.310 --> 16:02.922
- What the fuck is going on?
- Nothing. I'm just thinking about the veal.

16:03.047 --> 16:07.183
It's an overpriced fucking soft meat.
Huh?

16:08.341 --> 16:09.362
- Are you okay?

16:09.487 --> 16:12.498
- It itches.
- You'll have it off in an hour.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.566
I just hope I don't scratch it
so much someone sees.

16:14.691 --> 16:17.434
Well, it's not real, so scratching is not
gonna help your problem.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.693
I understand.

16:23.864 --> 16:25.974
- You're panicking, Vince.
- No, I'm not.

16:26.099 --> 16:27.910
- You're freezing.
- Shut up, Billy. I'm not.

16:28.035 --> 16:30.379
- You ever see "Midnight Express"?
- Yeah.

16:30.504 --> 16:32.280
He panicked.
He froze.

16:32.405 --> 16:34.482
I know. I'm not.

16:34.607 --> 16:36.884
- Do you remember what happened to him?
- Yeah.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.819
Don't panic, Vince.
Don't freeze.

16:38.944 --> 16:42.293
I'm not. I won't.

16:43.316 --> 16:44.592
- Yo yo.
- Yo.

16:44.717 --> 16:46.027
What are you guys doing here?

16:46.152 --> 16:47.662
We came for support, bro.

16:47.787 --> 16:49.730
I don't need support to take a piss.

16:49.855 --> 16:52.166
Yeah, we were all worried.
Are you all right?

16:52.291 --> 16:54.334
- Yeah, do I look all right?
- I guess.

16:54.459 --> 16:57.537
- Real confidence booster you are, Eric.
- <i>Hey, good luck, Vince.</i>

16:57.662 --> 17:01.097
Uh, I need to talk to E for a second.

17:07.502 --> 17:09.146
- You nervous?
- Yep.

17:09.271 --> 17:12.016
- It's gonna be okay, Vince.
- You think?

17:12.141 --> 17:15.151
- E, I told you I'd tell you everything,

17:15.276 --> 17:17.787
- so I'm telling you.
- What?

17:17.912 --> 17:20.373
- No lectures.
- Lectures are done, Vince.

17:21.515 --> 17:24.759
I'm wearing a fake cock.

17:24.884 --> 17:27.627
- What?
- A fake cock.

17:27.752 --> 17:29.895
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, I'm not fucking with you,

17:30.020 --> 17:31.830
but I'm freaking the fuck out.

17:31.955 --> 17:33.665
Billy gave it to me.
Do you wanna see it?

17:33.790 --> 17:35.567
No, I don't wanna see it.

17:35.692 --> 17:37.336
It's got clean piss in it.

17:37.461 --> 17:40.038
Are you out of your fucking mind?!

17:40.163 --> 17:41.973
This isn't a lecture,
this is a request--

17:42.098 --> 17:43.841
put that fucking thing away!

17:43.966 --> 17:45.943
E, I will fail this test

17:46.068 --> 17:47.577
and I don't know what
they're gonna do to me.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.278
I don't know what they're gonna do
with you either, right?

17:49.403 --> 17:51.013
It's gonna be nothing
compared to what happens

17:51.138 --> 17:52.781
- if you get caught with that thing.
- I won't get caught.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.383
- And what if you do?
- You never make this shit easy.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.918
Look, it's either gonna
show up or it's not.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.120
Okay? It's weed!
The judge is cool,

18:00.245 --> 18:02.288
but no judge is gonna
be cool with that.

18:02.413 --> 18:05.324
Things always work out for us, Vince.
We <i>will</i> get through this

18:05.449 --> 18:08.059
and it <i>will</i> work out.
I guarantee it!

18:08.184 --> 18:11.632
But you cannot walk in there with that
or you'll be throwing your whole life away.

18:20.258 --> 18:23.003
- How could you fucking use me like that?
- Dana, I was not using you.

18:23.128 --> 18:24.087
I just thought--

18:24.212 --> 18:25.805
Oh, that what?
You should bring me to the place

18:25.930 --> 18:28.809
- that the guy who's fucking your wife owns?
- He has good food.

18:28.934 --> 18:30.610
Ari, I knew when
you called me last night

18:30.735 --> 18:33.480
I shouldn't get into this with you again.
We were into it once before.

18:33.605 --> 18:35.149
Yeah, and we had a good thing once.

18:35.274 --> 18:37.050
I actually remember it
that way, okay?

18:37.175 --> 18:38.686
I never remember
feeling bad about it,

18:38.811 --> 18:40.355
- but tonight I really do.
- Look, I'm sorry.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.025
What?
Look, don't be, okay?

18:43.150 --> 18:45.094
We deal with each other
on a daily basis.

18:45.219 --> 18:47.463
- Just please forget this ever happened.
- Look, Dana--

18:47.588 --> 18:49.628
goodbye, Ari!

18:52.059 --> 18:53.502
Hello.

18:53.627 --> 18:56.438
- What the fuck are you thinking?!
- <i>What's the problem?</i>

18:56.563 --> 18:59.308
What, you think that Bobby wouldn't tell me
that you were there on a date?

18:59.433 --> 19:02.410
Well, I guess the bro code's out the window
when you're fucking someone's wife.

19:02.535 --> 19:05.214
I'm really hurt and, quite frankly,
embarrassed!

19:05.339 --> 19:08.050
- How do you think <i>I</i> felt?
- <i>Anyone else, Ari.</i>

19:08.175 --> 19:09.918
I mean, even if you insist
on throwing it in my face,

19:10.043 --> 19:12.921
- I could deal with <i>anyone</i> else.
- What do you mean?

19:13.046 --> 19:15.591
- I always knew you were fucking Ana Gordon.
- That's not true.

19:15.716 --> 19:18.460
- Not since 1992.
- What? The year that I moved out here?

19:18.585 --> 19:21.196
I have <i>never</i> cheated on you,

19:21.321 --> 19:23.198
but it's nice to know
that you still care.

19:23.323 --> 19:25.581
However you wanna look at it, Ari.

19:29.729 --> 19:31.973
- I can't take the stress.
- Ah, you can't?

19:32.098 --> 19:33.575
- What about Vinnie?
- No, I'm fine.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.544
- Ah, yeah?
- What happens happens.

19:35.669 --> 19:38.677
- We will overcome.
- We're survivors, Vince.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.262
I think you're gonna pass, Vin.

19:40.428 --> 19:42.216
Oh, now you're being positive?
You said he had no chance.

19:42.341 --> 19:45.119
I read my horoscope.
And it said good things were gonna happen for me.

19:45.244 --> 19:47.322
That's good, jerkoff.
Maybe you should've read his.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.524
You don't lock doors around here?
I could be robbing the place.

19:49.649 --> 19:53.567
- Ari, you didn't have to come to this.
- I got nowhere else to be.

19:54.821 --> 19:56.398
Are you all right, Ari?

19:56.523 --> 20:00.302
Listen, we had a little problem.
Vince may fail his drug test.

20:00.427 --> 20:03.072
- No. Blow?
- Weed.

20:03.197 --> 20:05.575
Jesus fucking Christ, Vinnie!

20:05.700 --> 20:08.445
Even if he does, Lefkowitz has dealt
with this judge a lot.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.214
<i>He doesn't think he'll get more than
a 10-day sentee.</i>

20:10.339 --> 20:13.117
- We'll lose "Air-Walker."
- Well, you can talk to Dana Gordon

20:13.242 --> 20:14.886
about that, right?

20:15.011 --> 20:15.921
- I--
- Lefkowitz right here.

20:16.046 --> 20:18.323
I want it.
Here we go.

20:18.448 --> 20:21.804
<i>Hey, Jim.
Yeah.</i>

20:25.251 --> 20:26.227
Yeah yeah.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.027
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

20:28.152 --> 20:30.560
I appreciate it.

20:30.685 --> 20:32.028
I'm all good.

20:32.313 --> 20:34.364
- Unbelievable.

20:34.489 --> 20:36.132
- That is amazing.
- Beyond amazing!

20:36.257 --> 20:38.767
God, the court system
is so beautifully fucked up.

20:38.892 --> 20:41.369
I mean, they must've switched your shit
with somebody else's.

20:41.494 --> 20:44.505
Some other poor sap will probably
get the electric chair.

20:44.630 --> 20:47.641
- Yeah, some people are just blessed, huh?
- I used to be blessed.

20:47.766 --> 20:51.243
This chapter is now over.
It's time to get back on top.

20:51.368 --> 20:53.144
- Johnny's movie, Ari?
- I'm on it.

20:53.269 --> 20:54.379
- "Air-Walker"?
- March.

20:54.504 --> 20:57.181
- My focus is back.
- I can't believe you passed!

20:57.306 --> 21:00.884
- Yeah, I can't believe it either.
- Yeah, well,

21:01.009 --> 21:04.430
- you know.
- You didn't take it off, did you?

21:08.433 --> 21:11.094
- You pissed?
- Pissed about what?

21:11.219 --> 21:13.463
- Honestly?
- Yeah, I suppose.

21:13.588 --> 21:16.650
- What are you guys talking about?
- Yeah, it's rude not to share.

21:16.816 --> 21:18.769
Look, I would've never agreed, but--

21:18.894 --> 21:21.771
- yeah?
- You sick fuck, you know what would happen

21:21.896 --> 21:23.372
if you would've gotten caught?!

21:23.497 --> 21:25.207
- Caught? What?
- I don't wanna know.

21:25.332 --> 21:27.876
- I do, I do.
- Me too. What the hell is going on?

21:28.001 --> 21:29.844
- Uh, I'll let you guys figure.
- No!

21:29.969 --> 21:31.446
- <i>Scared?</i>

21:34.807 --> 21:36.683
Hello?! Hello?!

21:36.808 --> 21:38.118
<i>Ha-ho!</i>

21:38.243 --> 21:39.371
Ha-ha-ha...
