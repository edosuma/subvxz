Land that I love

01:49.526 --> 01:54.279
Stand beside her
And guide her through the night

01:55.949 --> 01:59.201
With a light from above

01:59.369 --> 02:00.869
From the mountains

02:02.372 --> 02:08.377
To the prairies
To the oceans white with foam

02:09.795 --> 02:13.966
God bless America

02:14.134 --> 02:19.012
My home sweet home

02:19.722 --> 02:23.183
God bless America

02:25.103 --> 02:28.605
Land that I love

02:28.773 --> 02:33.569
Stand beside her
And guide her

02:33.736 --> 02:37.781
Through the night
With a light from above

02:39.117 --> 02:42.327
From the mountains

02:43.163 --> 02:45.330
To the prairies

02:48.459 --> 02:54.882
To the oceans white with foam

02:56.217 --> 03:03.307
God bless America

03:05.268 --> 03:14.401
My home sweet home

03:14.736 --> 03:17.613
From the mountains

03:18.323 --> 03:21.617
To the prairies

03:21.784 --> 03:27.748
To the oceans white with foam

03:29.918 --> 03:36.506
God bless America

03:37.383 --> 03:40.636
My home

03:40.803 --> 03:44.514
Where is he? Where is he hiding?

03:47.977 --> 03:52.314
I don't know. I've been looking
for him since yesterday.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.484
Aah! Oh.

03:57.278 --> 04:00.697
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Where is he?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.700
I don't know.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.622
What are you gonna do to him?

04:26.641 --> 04:28.892
You stay here in case
that rat shows up.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.144
Okay.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.373
Who you protecting,
you dumb asshole?

04:51.749 --> 04:55.085
A stoolie who rats on his own friends?

04:58.548 --> 05:01.258
They were your friends too.

05:07.473 --> 05:11.393
I got it. You wanna end up
like that bitch, huh?

05:25.491 --> 05:29.745
At Chun Lao's. Chinese theater.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.088
You stay here with this barrel of shit.

07:01.212 --> 07:07.968
Noodles. Noodles. Noodles.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.321
Uh--

08:00.855 --> 08:02.063
Easy, easy....

13:36.398 --> 13:38.399
This way. Hurry!

13:38.567 --> 13:41.986
There down. Mott Street.
Go. Go. Go.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.671
Noodles.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.554
Noodles.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.684
Noodles.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.894
Untie me.

17:02.062 --> 17:06.441
Stay that way. No, stay.
I want them to know I did it.

17:08.777 --> 17:12.739
Where you going?
I'm gonna go get Eve.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.615
Don't.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.126
Why?

17:29.089 --> 17:33.301
They-- They already been there.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.496
Do you need anything?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.040
Money?

18:07.628 --> 18:13.257
I got more than I need.
-Yeah, it's all yours now.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.090
Where to?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.892
Sir, where do you want to go?

20:31.021 --> 20:34.482
Anywhere. First bus.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.655
Buffalo?

20:43.408 --> 20:45.326
One way.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.331
That'll be $1.20.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.965
I wanna rent a car.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.635
Would you fill this out, please?

24:10.365 --> 24:13.325
Go, go.
Go ahead, shoot the dice, man.

24:13.493 --> 24:17.037
Shoot the dice. Shoot the dice.
Shoot the dice.

24:18.331 --> 24:21.834
That's right. That's right, man.
That's right.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.439
Noodles.

28:12.857 --> 28:16.068
I brought back
the key to your clock.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.121
Lock the door.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.095
When did you get back?

28:44.639 --> 28:48.142
-Today.
-Why?

28:49.477 --> 28:53.981
-They got in touch with me.
-Who?

28:54.149 --> 28:56.275
I thought you might know.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.026
Me?

28:58.194 --> 29:01.780
I don't know nothing
about nobody no more.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.971
You gonna offer me a drink?

29:26.681 --> 29:29.475
Yeah, forgive me. Sure. Of course.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.685
Please sit down.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.297
Who's Robert Williams?

30:02.550 --> 30:03.884
I am.

30:10.391 --> 30:15.395
"We wish to inform you that following
the sale of the Beth Israel Cemetery...."

30:15.855 --> 30:20.067
Yeah, the synagogue sent these out
if you wanted to relocate your loved ones.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.278
I got the same letter
on account of my father.

30:24.113 --> 30:28.575
Only the synagogue didn't send that.
I got that last week.

30:28.743 --> 30:31.537
The rabbi told me he sent those out
about eight months ago.

30:31.704 --> 30:35.082
Yeah, that's right.
That's just about when I got mine.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.629
So, what else did he say, the rabbi?

30:40.797 --> 30:44.424
He said that I was lucky.
The bodies of Philip Stein...

30:44.592 --> 30:49.388
...Maximilian Bercovicz, Patrick
Goldberg were already spoken for.

30:49.597 --> 30:53.892
And they were up in
a very fancy cemetery in Riverdale.

30:57.146 --> 30:59.314
What's this all mean?

30:59.524 --> 31:01.316
It means...

31:03.444 --> 31:08.490
..."Noodles, though you've been hiding
in the asshole of the world, we found you.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.576
We know where you are."

31:11.286 --> 31:13.161
It means...

31:14.038 --> 31:15.330
..."Get ready."

31:17.959 --> 31:19.251
For what?

31:22.672 --> 31:25.465
That's the one thing it didn't say.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.538
What do you think?

31:56.706 --> 32:00.834
I think the answer's here.
That's why I came back.

32:03.963 --> 32:06.173
Hm.

32:19.854 --> 32:22.814
I moved everything in here.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.697
I had to sell the house,
the backroom.

32:31.991 --> 32:36.870
You know, I always thought you might have
helped yourself to that million bucks.

32:37.038 --> 32:39.206
But now I know.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.125
No.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.338
You're on your ass worse than ever.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.217
But I thought it was you who--

32:50.385 --> 32:52.761
No, you thought wrong.

32:54.847 --> 32:57.391
The suitcase was empty.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.145
Then who took it?

33:06.401 --> 33:10.278
That's what I've been asking myself
for 35 years.

33:21.874 --> 33:24.793
If it bothers you, I can sleep here.

33:24.961 --> 33:29.089
-You can have my room.
-No. It's okay.

33:48.901 --> 33:52.612
-How's your sister?
-I ain't seen her for years.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.782
She's a big star now.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.495
We should have known, huh?

34:01.330 --> 34:04.833
You can always tell the winners
at the starting gate.

34:05.585 --> 34:09.504
You can always tell the winners,
and you can tell the losers.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.507
Who would've put a penny on you?

34:15.511 --> 34:18.429
I'd have put everything
I ever had on you.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.768
Yeah, and you would've lost.

34:35.782 --> 34:40.118
Well, you're beat. Good night.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.996
Good night, Moe. Thanks.

34:48.377 --> 34:51.379
What have you been doing
all these years?

34:55.259 --> 34:57.385
Been going to bed early.

39:47.134 --> 39:49.677
Deborah, Papa says you should help.

39:50.137 --> 39:51.471
No.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.016
We've got customers all over.
We can't do everything.

39:55.184 --> 39:58.853
Try. I've got my elocution lessons.

40:49.697 --> 40:54.200
Fat, you better spray the toilet.
I saw a cockroach in there.

41:10.718 --> 41:11.718
Sorry.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.020
Sorry, I can't make it today.
See you tomorrow.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.189
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

41:32.406 --> 41:34.199
Sorry, Fats.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.917
Noodles!
Bugsy's got a job for us.

41:44.084 --> 41:46.085
Hurry up. He don't wait.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.788
Who you calling a cockroach?

42:21.956 --> 42:25.124
So, what are you?
You're filthy, you make me sick.

42:25.292 --> 42:29.462
You crawl up toilet walls
just like a roach. So, what are you?

42:29.630 --> 42:31.172
Let go!

42:31.340 --> 42:35.301
I make you sick, huh? Then how
come you showed me your tush?

42:35.553 --> 42:37.845
Hm. To a roach.

42:41.225 --> 42:44.811
Go look at yourself, David Aaronson.

42:59.660 --> 43:03.621
She don't leave me alone, I'm gonna
give her what she's asking for.

43:03.789 --> 43:06.332
-What's Bugsy want?
-We gotta wake up a deadbeat.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.627
That schmuck at the newsstand
didn't pay.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.845
Here's your money, sir.

44:21.116 --> 44:23.117
It's beautiful.

44:27.164 --> 44:30.458
Ha-ha-ha.
-Look at it, it looks great! Wow!

44:38.425 --> 44:40.510
Come on, guys.

44:48.435 --> 44:50.895
Come on, come on.

44:51.605 --> 44:53.856
Now make up your mind.

44:54.233 --> 44:57.652
-Noodles, let's take the dollar.
-Yeah.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.363
Skip, here you go.

45:02.449 --> 45:03.991
That one.

45:04.993 --> 45:06.244
Him.

45:06.495 --> 45:08.996
Hey, Sam, I'll see you next Thursday.

45:09.456 --> 45:13.084
That one.
Hey, and bring your wife along.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.461
Are you nuts?

45:15.629 --> 45:19.841
Bugsy said we could take the dollar
or we could roll the drunk.

45:20.008 --> 45:22.301
Yeah, but he ain't even drunk yet.

45:23.011 --> 45:24.512
We'll wait.

45:27.516 --> 45:32.311
-Well, you roll that one over there.
-What's to roll? He drunk it all.

45:37.192 --> 45:39.277
Bounce that little shikker.

46:28.368 --> 46:29.744
Jacket.

46:40.005 --> 46:41.964
It's Fartface.

46:45.594 --> 46:46.886
Shit!

46:48.764 --> 46:50.681
We should've took the dollar.

46:50.849 --> 46:54.727
Could've had 10 hot corned-beef
sandwiches on poppy-seed rolls.

47:06.740 --> 47:12.245
Look, the wagon will hide us
from Fartface. Get ready!

47:41.859 --> 47:43.651
Now! Throw your jacket over him.

47:45.821 --> 47:50.658
Hey, mister, you sick? Aw, poor guy,
you'll be okay. Come on, I'll help you.

47:50.826 --> 47:53.661
Come on, up you go.

47:53.829 --> 47:56.497
Now, you're worse
than my Uncle Nathan.

47:56.665 --> 48:00.126
Why do you want to get soused?
You can't even walk. I'll take you home.

48:00.294 --> 48:02.128
Go, Mama.

48:11.054 --> 48:14.348
Stop right there. Hey, you!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

48:15.684 --> 48:17.852
What the hell are you kids doing here?

48:18.061 --> 48:21.856
-What are we kids doing here?
-We're getting it up the ass.

48:22.357 --> 48:25.651
Yeah, getting screwed.
Is there a law against it?

48:25.819 --> 48:29.780
Can you spare a dime for
pisherkehs that just got it up the ass?

48:29.948 --> 48:32.700
Come on, get out of here.
Come on, get off the street.

48:32.868 --> 48:35.286
Go on, get out of here.
Get off the street.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.663
Go ahead. And don't come back.

48:37.831 --> 48:41.667
I don't want to ever see you here again.
All right?

49:13.992 --> 49:17.119
Hey, stop by for you later.

49:19.373 --> 49:21.874
Yeah, but knock here on the john first.

49:23.669 --> 49:28.756
My old man's praying, and my old lady's
crying. And the light's turned off.

49:29.049 --> 49:33.552
What the hell should I go home for?
At least in here I can read.

50:36.283 --> 50:39.493
Where are you going?
Mama, don't get worked up.

50:39.703 --> 50:41.620
You got pots to clean.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.085
Peggeleh?

50:48.253 --> 50:51.255
I'll be right back, Ma.
I gotta go to the can.

50:58.722 --> 51:00.181
Hi, Peggy.

51:00.348 --> 51:02.975
At least you could lock the door.

51:06.313 --> 51:07.855
Don't you like it?

51:15.489 --> 51:16.739
I've seen better.

51:17.491 --> 51:19.825
-You seen lots?
-How many you seen?

51:20.494 --> 51:23.162
I'll tell you how many. None.

51:27.959 --> 51:29.502
Let me see yours.

51:44.059 --> 51:46.685
Looksies, no feelsies.

51:49.564 --> 51:53.651
Peggy. Peggy, I-- I-- I--

51:55.070 --> 51:56.529
I want--

51:56.988 --> 51:59.865
-You like it, don't you?
-Not for free, I don't.

52:00.075 --> 52:04.286
You bring me a charlotte russe with whipped
cream, then you can do anything you like.

52:04.496 --> 52:07.248
Tomorrow. I'll bring it
to you tomorrow.

52:07.415 --> 52:10.417
-I'll bring it tomorrow.
-Look, I don't give credit.

52:10.585 --> 52:12.086
I promise. I promise.

52:12.295 --> 52:16.423
You better stop squeezing me,
or I'm gonna poop in my pants.

52:22.931 --> 52:24.265
Well, are you getting out?

53:12.772 --> 53:15.232
Come on, come on.

53:42.469 --> 53:44.637
Give me six copies.

53:46.181 --> 53:49.308
Drop your pants
and I'll stick it to you again.

53:53.396 --> 53:56.690
-What do you mean, "again"?
-That's a long story.

53:56.900 --> 53:59.693
And look what time it is.

54:00.111 --> 54:04.198
It's already 6:34. And I gotta go.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.868
Boy, I got a lot of work to do.

54:08.036 --> 54:09.995
Hold it a minute.

54:10.163 --> 54:14.833
Now it's 6:35.
And I ain't got a damn thing to do.

54:15.210 --> 54:19.046
Just you wait, asshole.
I'll do something with your time.

54:19.214 --> 54:20.547
Wait! Hey!

54:20.715 --> 54:23.008
Since we're talking about time...

54:23.176 --> 54:26.929
...it looks like you're gonna break
that lamp at 6:36.

54:28.306 --> 54:29.848
-Where'd you pinch this?
-It's mine.

54:30.016 --> 54:32.643
-Prove it.
-I gave it to him.

54:33.478 --> 54:35.145
Oh, yeah?

54:35.939 --> 54:37.731
Who the hell are you?

54:38.483 --> 54:41.151
-Where you from?
-The Bronx.

54:41.736 --> 54:44.029
And you give away watches?

54:44.572 --> 54:46.532
He's my uncle.

54:47.075 --> 54:49.743
-And who gave it to you?
-My Uncle Nathan.

54:50.370 --> 54:52.204
My little brother.

54:52.706 --> 54:55.833
Tell your uncle
to stop by the precinct.

54:56.001 --> 54:57.876
He's dead.
-Alcoholic.

54:58.044 --> 55:00.045
In Kishnev, Poland.

55:02.757 --> 55:04.341
Hm.

55:05.051 --> 55:08.012
Then he don't need it no more.
It's been requisitioned.

55:08.346 --> 55:14.059
-Requi-- What's that mean?
-Pinched, by him. At 6:37.

55:14.227 --> 55:17.396
Just remember,
I got my eye on you two.

55:17.564 --> 55:19.773
I got my eye on you too.

55:19.983 --> 55:24.611
Take it! Take it!
Take the lamp off. I can't hold it.

55:25.905 --> 55:27.656
Max.

55:31.536 --> 55:33.245
Who's this?

55:35.290 --> 55:37.041
My uncle.

55:56.936 --> 56:00.647
-That one. With the cream.
-The 5-cent one?

56:01.024 --> 56:02.483
Yeah.

56:02.650 --> 56:07.112
For the twopenny one she only gives
you a hand job. I can do that myself.

56:08.615 --> 56:09.656
Not that one!

56:10.241 --> 56:11.825
That one.

56:12.827 --> 56:14.286
You sure?

56:15.288 --> 56:17.331
Wrap it up pretty.

56:56.955 --> 56:59.790
Good morning. Peggy home?

56:59.958 --> 57:01.875
She's taking a bath.

57:02.085 --> 57:04.670
That's great.
Would you tell her I'm here?

57:04.838 --> 57:08.298
Hey, Ma. Another bucket of water.

57:09.592 --> 57:11.468
Wait.

59:40.994 --> 59:43.829
What do you want?
-Me?

59:44.372 --> 59:49.376
-Mama said you were looking for me.
-Oh, ye-- No. The guys told me that--

59:49.544 --> 59:53.755
-What?
-I'll come back some other time.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.667
Noodles!

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:35.422
Noodles! Noodles! Noodles!

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.137
What?

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.722
Did you get it?

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:48.602
His asshole blinked, but we got him.
Nice going, Fartface. And on duty too.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:53.440
Heh. Uh, ha, ha. You boys caught me
with my pants down that time. Heh, heh.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:56.693
No, we caught you with your schmuck
up the tuchus of a minor.

01:00:56.861 --> 01:01:00.739
-Scram. Put this someplace safe.
That's all right. Ha, ha. Hey, hold it!

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:03.200
Where you going?
Stop! Hold it! Wait a minute!

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.118
Hey, you, stop! Hold it.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:10.290
-What are you gonna do with that plate?
-Depends. What time is it, Max?

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:13.418
I think it's time
we got our watch back.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:17.381
-Okay, boys, we're even.
-The hell we are.

01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:19.966
You'll be collecting your
pension before we're even.

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:21.760
Hiya, fellas.

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.429
What do you boys want?

01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:26.932
First off...

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:29.267
-...you're paying Peggy for us.
Ha, ha.

01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:31.561
Okay. That's it?

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:33.397
Go ahead while I tell him.

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:37.609
Ha-ha-ha. I can't believe it.
My first time, and a lousy cop's paying for it.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:44.282
Look, what else do you kids
want for that plate? Huh?

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.494
Noodles was telling me
about a guy called Bugsy.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:50.497
Seems he's boss of this neighborhood,
thanks to you.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:53.792
-Meaning what?
-Meaning he pays you off.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.671
Will you slow down?
What is your hurry? Take it easy.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.966
If you keep this up,
you're gonna come too fast.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:06.680
Do you see what I mean?
You're so stupid. I can't believe it.

01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:12.185
So why does Bugsy pay you?
What do you do for him?

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:17.649
-I close an eye once in a while.
-Well, now you close an eye for us.

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:21.027
Why? What are you kids up to?

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.366
He'll tell you.

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:30.120
Me, him, Cockeye and Patsy,
we're working together.

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:32.831
Bugsy'll flatten you.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:36.334
Besides, I don't put up with
no trouble on my beat.

01:02:36.502 --> 01:02:40.630
You'll put up, and you'll shut up.
You hear nothing, and you see nothing.

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:42.674
Just like you did for Bugsy.

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.217
Shit!

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:49.514
Aw, don't get upset. That makes it worse.
It can happen the first time.

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:54.144
-It's them two talking out there.
-Can't you see you're ruining the mood?

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.646
We made our deal.

01:02:57.231 --> 01:03:00.942
-So take a walk.
Come here, honey.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:06.740
-Feel good, bubeleh?
-Ha! He'll never get it up.

01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:12.496
Relax. Okay. Calm down, calm down.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:22.714
Okay. Okay, come here.

01:04:42.461 --> 01:04:44.296
I'm glad the baby's better.

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:48.925
Happy Pesach, Deborah.
Happy Pesach, Becky.

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:57.350
Hurry. We're gonna be late.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.353
-Oh, there's Deborah.
-Sorry I'm late. Mama needed help.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:05.442
Good girl. I just locked up,
and I'm giving you the keys.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:22.459
I thought I'd just practice my dance
routines. That's all. All right?

01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:25.837
Debbeleh, make sure you
don't let the goyim in.

01:05:26.839 --> 01:05:30.508
-Okay, bye.
-See you later, Debbie. Bye.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.458
Get down off of there, roach.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.419
That record's just like Ex-Lax.

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:51.297
Every time I put it on,
you have to go to the bathroom.

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:10.442
What are you doing?

01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:13.445
-Give me a drink.
-We're closed.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:18.158
Nice people don't drink on Pesach.
They go to the synagogue.

01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:20.326
So, what are you doing here?

01:07:20.494 --> 01:07:23.288
Somebody's gotta keep an eye
on the place.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:27.667
There are a lot of little thieves out there.
One of them could get into your house.

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:31.004
Especially if you leave the door open.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:06.164
You can pray here too.

01:08:07.374 --> 01:08:11.252
Here or in the synagogue,
to God it's the same difference.

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:15.048
Come over here and sit down.

01:08:48.165 --> 01:08:51.042
"My beloved is white and ruddy.

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:54.837
His skin is as the most fine gold.

01:08:55.005 --> 01:08:59.050
His cheeks are as a bed of spices."

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:05.598
Even though he hasn't washed
since last December.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.856
"His eyes are as the eyes of doves.

01:09:13.023 --> 01:09:15.733
His body is as bright ivory.

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:19.821
His legs are as pillars of marble."

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:24.576
In pants so dirty
they stand by themselves.

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:29.581
"He is altogether lovable."

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.710
But he'll always be a two-bit punk...

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:38.756
...so he'll never be my beloved.
What a shame.

01:10:10.247 --> 01:10:11.956
Somebody's there.

01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:26.179
There ain't nobody.

01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:34.145
It's Max.

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:37.523
Ah. So that's who it was.

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:39.817
Noodles!

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:46.824
Go on, run.
Your mother's calling you.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.332
Noodles!

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:58.002
Just gonna go see what he wants.

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:29.993
Hey.
-Yo.

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:36.082
-You been here long?
-No.

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:39.460
Were you in there?

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:44.048
You're one lousy kisser.

01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:47.385
I seen you go in there
after that ball-buster.

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:52.557
Here's the stuff from last night. We got
4 for the silverware, 6 for the typewriter.

01:11:52.766 --> 01:11:56.978
Shitsy Lipschitz wouldn't cough up
any more. We gotta get somebody else.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:01.899
I came to divvy up.

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:07.030
-Tomorrow, with the others.
-I also came to pick you up.

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:12.535
-I can't come right now.
-The houses, the stores are all empty.

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:15.913
We got our pick. You pick that.

01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:18.750
Yeah.

01:12:21.795 --> 01:12:24.964
Some partner I got. Have fun.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:34.265
How's it going, boys?

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:36.601
Who's that?

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.936
Bugsy.

01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:59.665
I hear you guys are in business
for yourselves now, huh?

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:01.793
I hear youse are doing real good.

01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:10.885
Ain't you gonna introduce me
to your friend here?

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:17.266
I'll introduce myself.

01:13:22.147 --> 01:13:24.065
Excuse the glove.

01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:33.658
Ow!

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.368
Son of a bitch!

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.750
That's my cut.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:29.088
You don't work for me,
you don't work for no one.

01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:31.048
-I don't like bosses.
Ha, ha.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:35.052
You was better off
you stayed in the Bronx.

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:41.267
It would have been better for you too.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:27.480
-I'm gonna kill him one of these days.
-Yeah?

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:32.443
Meantime it looks like he's killed us.

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:54.507
Deborah, open up the door.

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:58.719
Deborah, open up the door.

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.806
Deborah.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:47.685
That stuff, is it ready for the club?
-We're loading it.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:27.058
Eh. Che cazzo succede down here?
-Al, we got the big boys with us today.

01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:30.936
-They wanna work for us.
-Doing what Bugsy did. We want his job.

01:17:31.104 --> 01:17:32.271
Do you get that? Ha, ha.

01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:37.818
We the best escorts you ever gonna get.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:41.530
A fangulo a ma, escort your
mother's ass out of here.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:48.120
Okay. Let's go, Noodles. We'll peddle
your invention somewhere else, huh?

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:51.957
Hey, wait a minute.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:54.877
What invention?

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.963
-You ship your stuff by the river, right?
-Sometimes.

01:17:58.131 --> 01:18:01.717
And when you get caught by the Coast
Guard, you throw all the cases overboard.

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:04.595
-You lose the whole shipment.
So?

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:07.473
For 10 percent,
we'll save it all for you.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.434
-What do you got, a submarine?
-We got salt.

01:18:11.895 --> 01:18:13.437
You got what?

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:18.442
-Salt. Me and the boys are rolling salts.
-Yeah. We need 3 tons of salt per shipment.

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:22.154
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to school where you belong.

01:18:22.614 --> 01:18:25.116
What is it with all this salt?

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:29.787
Hey, hey, we got salt on our noodles.
Show them.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.468
This is full of salt.

01:18:49.474 --> 01:18:51.100
All right, come here.

01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:08.868
So?
-Keep your shirt on.

01:19:09.035 --> 01:19:11.662
We gotta wait for the salt
to dissolve.

01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:46.822
-Well?
-Hey, what's wrong?

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.038
Hey, look.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.373
Hey. Wow!

01:19:58.543 --> 01:19:59.877
Great!

01:20:01.379 --> 01:20:03.881
-Look at that!
-It's great.

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:05.466
-Noodles.
-Look at it.

01:20:07.093 --> 01:20:10.012
I see them! What did I tell you?
-Yeah.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.392
Yeah!

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:28.739
Hey, Noodles.
Hooray. Hooray for us!

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:33.911
We did it.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.539
Come here, Max.

01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:41.293
We did it.
No, Max, no!

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:46.298
Max.

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.426
Max.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:02.439
Max!

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:06.277
Max!

01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:23.043
What would you do without me?

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:29.902
There.

01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:36.533
From here on, we establish
the shared funds of the gang.

01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:39.703
They belong to all of us together
and to none of us alone.

01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:45.209
And we solemnly swear to put in 50
percent of everything we make. Agreed?

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:46.627
Agreed.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.712
Agreed.
Agreed.

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:53.509
Agreed.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.554
I wanna take another peek.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:19.076
Announcing the immediate departure...

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:23.914
...of the Lackawanna Railroad,
Hudson Valley Express, Poughkeepsie...

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:29.044
...Albany, Utica and Buffalo.

01:23:30.463 --> 01:23:32.548
All aboard.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:39.763
This goes to Fat Moe.
We don't tell him what it's for.

01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:43.267
And he gives it back
only when we're all together.

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:44.685
Agreed?

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.771
Agreed.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.276
Agreed.

01:24:49.876 --> 01:24:51.877
Bugsy's coming! Run!

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.639
Noodles.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:48.600
I slipped.

01:27:26.699 --> 01:27:30.118
Bastard!
-Aah!

01:27:30.286 --> 01:27:32.454
Schmuck.

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:49.049
Wanna go in?

01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:54.346
Yeah.

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:56.765
You a relative?

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.311
An uncle.

01:30:13.866 --> 01:30:15.492
It's open.

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:30.687
"Erected to their everlasting
memory by their friend and brother...

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:33.273
...David Aaronson, 1967."

01:36:13.142 --> 01:36:15.351
Can I take that for you, sir?

01:36:17.813 --> 01:36:19.856
Your limousine is waiting.

01:36:30.242 --> 01:36:31.951
Maxie.

01:36:43.547 --> 01:36:46.549
How are you, uncle?
You're looking good.

01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:49.761
You're looking a little better.

01:36:53.349 --> 01:36:57.268
Come on. Better get
you off the streets.

01:37:00.523 --> 01:37:03.775
-Some limousine.
-Ha, ha. What are you talking, huh?

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:08.696
We own the company now. It's a good
cover. You'd be surprised. It pays off too.

01:37:08.864 --> 01:37:12.742
My mother wrote me you was
in the body-snatching business.

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:18.289
By the way, I appreciate
everything you did for my family.

01:37:18.541 --> 01:37:20.750
Forget it. It's your dough.

01:37:21.418 --> 01:37:24.754
It's all down in black and white
in the company books.

01:37:25.589 --> 01:37:29.926
You're the company. You and Patsy and
Cockeye. Gravediggers and equal partners.

01:37:30.094 --> 01:37:34.305
Heh. Hey, enough of this, huh?
Business before pleasure.

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:37.267
We got a rush job. Here.

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:43.147
Come here. Look at this. Come here.

01:37:44.775 --> 01:37:48.528
Sudden death. Fucking tragedy, huh?

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:53.157
-Twenty-six years old.
-Twenty-six?

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:59.163
- What a shame.
-Great stiff. She died of an overdose.

01:37:59.331 --> 01:38:01.332
And I'm ready for another. Ha-ha-ha.

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:05.044
Come on, Noodles. Pump the life into her.
You didn't turn pansy in there, did you?

01:38:08.757 --> 01:38:09.841
There you go.

01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:17.181
Turning over in the grave.
They do it every time.

01:38:58.182 --> 01:39:01.017
Ha, ha. Don't worry. A pansy he ain't.

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:06.522
Thanks.
You're welcome, Noodles.

01:39:07.191 --> 01:39:08.983
Whoops. Uh, sorry.

01:39:09.318 --> 01:39:11.486
Thanks. Good night.

01:39:12.196 --> 01:39:17.200
Hey, you want a little pick-me-up?
Oh, no, thanks. I've had mine.

01:39:18.869 --> 01:39:21.245
Did you give her your all?
What do you think?

01:39:21.413 --> 01:39:22.997
Bet your life I did.

01:39:48.065 --> 01:39:50.525
Wait till you see this place. Got the best....

01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:52.151
It's over here.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:58.074
-Where we going?
-To a place that never closes.

01:39:58.951 --> 01:40:00.952
Whoops. Watch yourself.

01:40:11.922 --> 01:40:14.048
How's he doing?
He's doing great.

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:19.470
What's this?

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.098
Our place.
We got the hottest spot in town.

01:40:29.231 --> 01:40:32.775
Eh? This is the real Fat Moe's.

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:36.112
Get rid of that rag, will you?

01:40:37.448 --> 01:40:39.657
-What do you think?
-It's beautiful.

01:40:39.825 --> 01:40:42.326
-Eh? You like it?
-Beautiful. Beautiful.

01:40:57.801 --> 01:40:59.594
Hey, give me that.

01:41:04.808 --> 01:41:08.019
-Noodles. Look who's here.
Patsy, look.

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:10.855
Come here, son of a bitch.
Come here! Come here!

01:41:11.023 --> 01:41:12.982
Patsy.
Oh.

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:15.485
-You look fantastic.
-Wait a minute.

01:41:15.652 --> 01:41:16.986
How you doing?

01:41:19.865 --> 01:41:22.116
-Look how big you got.
-Me?

01:41:22.284 --> 01:41:24.327
Noodles. Oh. Oh, God.

01:41:25.162 --> 01:41:27.330
-Noodles!
Freight train, coming through.

01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:35.880
Hey. Hey, come on.
Hey, let's have a toast, for chrissakes.

01:41:36.048 --> 01:41:38.674
-You look like shit.
-What do you want? I just got out of prison.

01:41:38.842 --> 01:41:40.927
-Nice guy.
-Hey. Hey, Noodles, get a load of this.

01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:42.136
Look.

01:41:45.182 --> 01:41:47.183
Hey, Scotch heating.

01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:49.352
-Yeah, a buck a cup.
Whoo!

01:41:50.479 --> 01:41:51.896
-A buck a cup?
-Yeah.

01:41:52.064 --> 01:41:53.856
-How much it cost us?
-Costing us?

01:41:54.024 --> 01:41:56.859
-Yeah.
-A dime, including overhead.

01:41:57.027 --> 01:42:00.363
-Hey, Noodles. Fat Moe.
Oh. Heh.

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:07.912
You look terrific.

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:14.502
-Look like you lost an ounce or two.
You think I would lose hemorrhoids.

01:42:16.171 --> 01:42:18.506
Can't recognize him without an apron.

01:42:18.674 --> 01:42:20.800
-L'chaim.
L'chaim.

01:42:21.885 --> 01:42:23.678
Welcome home.

01:42:27.057 --> 01:42:28.641
What the fuck kind of maÃ®tre d' are you?

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:31.227
New guy rolls into the joint,
you don't even show him around.

01:42:31.395 --> 01:42:33.104
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?

01:42:33.272 --> 01:42:37.108
-I didn't know. Eh, Noodles, I'm sorry.
You're some bunch of shtunks.

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:39.652
-You don't come up and get me?
He's the shtunk.

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.903
-Shtunk?
-Yeah, shtunk.

01:42:41.071 --> 01:42:44.407
-He said you weren't out till Monday.
-You can get him the next time he gets out.

01:42:44.575 --> 01:42:48.619
-Ha-ha-ha.
-God forbid. God forbid.

01:42:53.208 --> 01:42:57.420
Whoa! Whoa! Ha-ha-ha.

01:43:06.597 --> 01:43:09.891
Come on, let's see if you can
guess who it is.

01:43:12.436 --> 01:43:14.770
Mmm.

01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:18.399
Charlotte russe. With a little
too much whipped cream.

01:43:20.611 --> 01:43:22.111
Peggy.

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:30.620
Hey, you watch it, now.
And my prices, they've gone up.

01:43:30.787 --> 01:43:35.625
I work in a high-class joint now.
And I get paid by the pound.

01:43:35.792 --> 01:43:36.792
Whoa!

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.796
My Peggy, she's worth every penny
of it too, my red-hot mama.

01:43:42.674 --> 01:43:44.634
Come on, come on. Eh, eh, eh.

01:43:45.344 --> 01:43:46.802
You fuck.

01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:48.429
Timber!

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:53.517
You've seen your old pals, now I want you
to meet some new ones. Come on.

01:43:53.685 --> 01:43:57.647
Peggeleh, I'll see you later.
You gonna lay here all night or what?

01:44:07.991 --> 01:44:11.953
Cockeye wanted to play with the band.
I'm serious.

01:44:18.794 --> 01:44:20.378
Come on.

01:44:47.197 --> 01:44:50.658
-Aren't you going to say hello?
-Hello.

01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:14.515
-Your brother's a real friend.
-He's a romantic.

01:45:25.902 --> 01:45:29.739
-Max tell you I was getting out today?
-Max? No.

01:45:30.532 --> 01:45:35.077
-You remembered yourself?
-No, Moe. It's always Moe.

01:45:39.916 --> 01:45:41.709
Yeah.

01:45:50.302 --> 01:45:52.428
You mean you weren't
counting the days?

01:45:52.596 --> 01:45:58.100
Of course I was. 4344, 4343.

01:45:58.268 --> 01:46:00.603
I lost track at 3000.

01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:03.939
-That wasn't my choice.
-Yes, it was. It still is.

01:46:07.444 --> 01:46:10.571
Well, anyway, did you come here
to welcome me back at least?

01:46:10.739 --> 01:46:14.950
I still live here. I was on my way out.
Moe said I should at least say hello.

01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:20.289
I hope Moe didn't have to
bend your arm or anything like that.

01:46:22.667 --> 01:46:23.959
No.

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:27.671
Welcome back, Noodles.

01:46:30.842 --> 01:46:32.176
Hey, Noodles.

01:46:39.309 --> 01:46:40.851
You dancing?

01:46:41.478 --> 01:46:44.146
Every night at the Palace Theatre.

01:46:45.065 --> 01:46:50.319
I've made some progress since I danced
here among the brooms and the empties.

01:46:51.613 --> 01:46:55.825
You can come spy on me if you like.
If you have time.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.661
Every night.

01:47:15.011 --> 01:47:16.512
Noodles.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.686
Go on, Noodles,
your mother's calling you.

01:47:32.028 --> 01:47:34.655
It's good to see you again, Noodles.

01:47:47.544 --> 01:47:49.545
My pleasure.

01:47:57.929 --> 01:48:01.390
-Did you get the wine?
-Dago Red. The best.

01:48:09.065 --> 01:48:10.524
How you doing?

01:48:17.574 --> 01:48:21.243
There they are.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.

01:48:23.914 --> 01:48:27.082
Did you see that movie, Joe?
It was a good movie.

01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:28.876
-Hey, Max, how are you?
-Good to see you.

01:48:29.044 --> 01:48:30.669
Nice to see you.

01:48:31.463 --> 01:48:34.798
-This must be your friend Noodles.
-Noodles, say hello to Mr. Monaldi.

01:48:34.966 --> 01:48:37.092
-Hi, Noodles, how are you?
-I'm all right.

01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:41.597
It's very nice to meet you. But you don't
have to call me Mr. Monaldi like he says.

01:48:41.765 --> 01:48:46.227
I like my friends and people I respect
to call me Frankie.

01:48:47.062 --> 01:48:50.773
Come on, sit down.
Get some chairs and some glasses.

01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:58.113
Sit down, relax. You're home now.

01:49:07.999 --> 01:49:10.793
This is my very dear friend Joe.

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:14.255
He came all the way from Detroit
to ask me to do him a favor.

01:49:14.923 --> 01:49:16.799
And I wanna do it for him.

01:49:18.134 --> 01:49:23.806
I don't have to tell you who Joe is,
how far he got, or how far he's gonna get.

01:49:24.349 --> 01:49:27.935
He's not only my dear friend,
he's my brother.

01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:31.272
Frankie, I'll tell you the truth.
Even a Jew can't eat this shit.

01:49:32.941 --> 01:49:35.651
I mean, the mustard doesn't even help.

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:48.163
These guys with you?

01:49:48.748 --> 01:49:51.458
I told you these fellas are with me.

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:54.837
You could trust them.
You're in very good hands.

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:58.132
Just tell them exactly
what you want them to do.

01:49:59.843 --> 01:50:03.512
Move some diamonds from Detroit.
Kid stuff.

01:50:09.519 --> 01:50:11.395
Why us then?

01:50:12.022 --> 01:50:16.025
If it's kid stuff, why don't you have
the kids from Detroit do it?

01:50:18.695 --> 01:50:24.366
Excuse me, Noodles. What he means is
that it's something that's very simple...

01:50:24.534 --> 01:50:27.995
...but for now, he needs kids
from outside to handle it.

01:50:28.163 --> 01:50:32.750
He just found out they're gonna move
these diamonds to Holland in a few days.

01:50:32.917 --> 01:50:34.877
So it's something came up right away.

01:50:36.338 --> 01:50:38.047
You understand?

01:50:44.721 --> 01:50:46.430
Hey, Joe.

01:50:47.349 --> 01:50:53.395
Tell these guys the story about, um,
the pussy being insured. What is it?

01:50:55.732 --> 01:50:58.942
Tell these guys how you stumbled
on this whole thing with the jewels....

01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:01.403
Oh. Come on.
Tell them the story.

01:51:01.571 --> 01:51:05.366
The pussy insurance. The insurance
pussies. What is it? Tell them that story.

01:51:05.533 --> 01:51:11.413
Life is stranger than shit,
that's all. It's a pisser. No big story.

01:51:11.581 --> 01:51:15.084
I got this insurance agent,
this Jew kid named David.

01:51:15.251 --> 01:51:19.922
This kid conned me into every policy
in the world. Every policy, name it.

01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:23.884
Dogs, house, wife, life, anything.

01:51:24.052 --> 01:51:27.930
I'm drinking with the boys one night,
he comes in with his wife...

01:51:28.098 --> 01:51:31.433
...a pretty brunette with a nice ass
who works for a jeweler.

01:51:31.601 --> 01:51:34.436
And he's still on the hustle, this guy.

01:51:35.605 --> 01:51:38.357
So I wink at the guys,
I say, "Look...

01:51:40.068 --> 01:51:44.321
...the most serious policy that should be,
you don't have me covered for."

01:51:44.489 --> 01:51:47.324
He goes, "What's that, Joe?"
"Cock insurance."

01:51:48.743 --> 01:51:53.414
"You make me a policy that
when it don't work, I get a payment...

01:51:53.581 --> 01:51:55.749
...I'll write out a check now."

01:51:57.836 --> 01:52:03.674
He thinks, he says, "Oh, I don't know
if the actuality gauges govern this...

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:06.009
...but we can make a policy.

01:52:06.177 --> 01:52:09.430
But you gotta guarantee
you're in good health now."

01:52:09.597 --> 01:52:14.309
"Oh, that's simple. Look, leave her with me.
Come back and see if it stands up.

01:52:14.477 --> 01:52:17.438
If it stands up, then you know
I'm in good health to begin with."

01:52:17.605 --> 01:52:19.857
The jerk leaves her. I screw her.

01:52:20.024 --> 01:52:24.987
Not only that, she likes it. And she tells me,
she blabs when her boss, the jeweler...

01:52:25.155 --> 01:52:27.197
...is shipping stones to Holland...

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:31.660
...where he keeps his stash in a little drawer
in the safe. Everything in the world.

01:52:31.828 --> 01:52:35.164
Can't ask for more, right?
Except, one better.

01:52:35.331 --> 01:52:39.501
I never paid the first premium
on the new cock policy.

01:52:53.141 --> 01:52:54.641
Cock insurance.

01:53:00.356 --> 01:53:04.651
Life is funnier than shit.

01:53:05.028 --> 01:53:06.236
But...

01:53:10.033 --> 01:53:12.701
...be easy with the girl.

01:53:16.039 --> 01:53:18.332
I mean that. Be easy with the girl.

01:53:26.549 --> 01:53:28.050
Oh, my God!

01:53:34.557 --> 01:53:35.724
Open it!

01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:38.185
Who's gotten in?

01:53:46.277 --> 01:53:48.237
Had to go and be a hero, huh?

01:53:54.577 --> 01:53:56.078
Open it.
-No.

01:53:56.246 --> 01:53:59.248
Open it!
Don't-- No, don't hurt him!

01:53:59.415 --> 01:54:02.417
-Don't hurt him!
Get this cunt out of here.

01:54:02.585 --> 01:54:05.546
You animal! You asshole!

01:54:06.506 --> 01:54:08.924
-Come on. Come on, hit me.
What do you mean?

01:54:09.092 --> 01:54:10.759
-Hit me.
What, are you crazy?

01:54:10.927 --> 01:54:14.263
-Straighten up and fly right.
-I'm all right.

01:54:14.430 --> 01:54:17.307
Let me make it look real.
Make it look real.

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:20.102
Come on, knock it off.
-I'm all right. Let go.

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:22.771
Come on, cut the act.
-Hit me!

01:54:22.939 --> 01:54:26.733
She said hit her.
Go ahead, rap her in the mouth.

01:54:26.901 --> 01:54:29.778
Hit me!
I'll hit you! You bitch!

01:54:32.615 --> 01:54:35.033
You animal!
Put a cork in her.

01:54:37.203 --> 01:54:39.955
No. Oh.

01:54:40.123 --> 01:54:41.248
No.

01:54:41.416 --> 01:54:43.458
No. Don't.

01:54:43.626 --> 01:54:46.295
Don't. No!

01:54:46.462 --> 01:54:52.426
No! You dirty bastards! You're--

01:54:56.764 --> 01:54:58.640
Bastards!

01:55:05.315 --> 01:55:07.149
Try the secret compartment.

01:55:13.656 --> 01:55:15.490
Attaboy.

01:55:25.168 --> 01:55:26.501
Thanks.

01:55:48.608 --> 01:55:51.693
Wow. Nice matzo balls.
Huh?

01:55:56.532 --> 01:55:58.951
Whoa.

01:55:59.118 --> 01:56:01.828
Those are beautiful. Look at that. Hm?

01:56:03.373 --> 01:56:05.707
Okay, better wrap them up.

01:56:14.842 --> 01:56:16.259
We're going. You coming?

01:56:20.056 --> 01:56:21.556
Coming.

01:57:08.938 --> 01:57:12.274
-Morning.
-You get the stones?

01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:34.838
Aw.... Pay him.

01:57:59.655 --> 01:58:04.159
-Any problem?
-No trouble. Kid stuff.

02:00:19.378 --> 02:00:21.004
You okay?

02:00:59.001 --> 02:01:02.921
-How come you didn't tell me?
-Being inside can change you.

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:05.966
I'd already made the deal with Frankie
to get rid of Joe.

02:01:06.133 --> 02:01:08.677
With Frankie Monaldi, you don't
say "yes," then "no." Couldn't...

02:01:08.844 --> 02:01:12.180
-...take the chance you'd change your mind.
-You're right. I would have said no.

02:01:12.723 --> 02:01:14.724
Frankie Monaldi is as big as they come.

02:01:14.892 --> 02:01:16.935
He's got the combination
in the palm of his hand.

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:19.938
If we're not careful, he'll have us
in the palm of his hand.

02:01:20.106 --> 02:01:22.357
You don't get nowhere alone.

02:01:22.858 --> 02:01:25.235
I thought you were the guy
that said you didn't like bosses.

02:01:25.403 --> 02:01:28.530
It sounded like a good idea then.
It still is.

02:01:28.698 --> 02:01:29.906
Let's just think about it.

02:01:30.074 --> 02:01:34.619
They're gonna ask us to come in
with them. There's a lot in it for us.

02:01:37.039 --> 02:01:41.543
Today they ask us to get rid of Joe.
Tomorrow they ask me to get rid of you.

02:01:41.711 --> 02:01:45.088
Is that okay with you?
Because it's not okay with me.

02:01:48.092 --> 02:01:49.926
All right.

02:01:51.095 --> 02:01:53.179
Let's just forget about it.

02:02:06.527 --> 02:02:08.069
Wanna go for a swim?

02:02:10.448 --> 02:02:12.866
Yeah, let's go for a swim.

02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:26.004
All right, what are you doing?

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:29.591
Hey, Noodles.
Don't fuck around, Noodles.

02:02:32.678 --> 02:02:35.096
-What are you doing?
Hey!

02:02:35.264 --> 02:02:37.515
Are you crazy?

02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:42.228
Shit.

02:02:48.819 --> 02:02:52.489
That asshole!
I can't believe you did this!

02:03:10.007 --> 02:03:13.718
District Attorney James Lister
was killed in an explosion of a car...

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:16.554
...belonging to Secretary of Commerce
Christopher Bailey...

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:20.016
...as he was leaving
the secretary's Long Island estate.

02:03:20.184 --> 02:03:23.603
Mr. Lister, who was killed instantly
in the blast, was scheduled to testify...

02:03:23.771 --> 02:03:26.940
...in Washington on Thursday
before a Senate committee.

02:03:27.108 --> 02:03:31.111
A committee investigating what has
come to be called the Bailey scandal.

02:03:31.278 --> 02:03:34.656
A special team of detectives
has been assigned to the case.

02:03:34.824 --> 02:03:39.661
As for Secretary Bailey, he was not
available for any statement at this time.

02:03:40.538 --> 02:03:41.663
Did you know those guys?

02:03:41.831 --> 02:03:45.166
--offices of his longtime legal advisor,
Irving Gold...

02:03:45.334 --> 02:03:47.877
...in hopes of getting some comment.

02:03:48.045 --> 02:03:52.465
Mr. Gold, you're aware
that District Attorney Lister...

02:03:52.633 --> 02:03:56.553
...is the second witness in the Bailey
scandal to meet a sudden and violent end.

02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.223
The first was Thomas Finney,
undersecretary of commerce...

02:04:00.391 --> 02:04:04.602
...who fell to his death from
his 15th-floor office just a month ago.

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:06.396
Do you think there's a connection--?

02:04:06.564 --> 02:04:10.567
Take the money and run, Noodles.
What the hell's keeping you here?

02:04:11.527 --> 02:04:14.362
The only remaining witness
is the man who...

02:04:14.530 --> 02:04:19.659
...rightly or wrongly has given his name
to this whole affair, Secretary Bailey.

02:04:19.827 --> 02:04:22.579
-I'm curious.
What does the secretary think?

02:04:22.746 --> 02:04:24.747
The secretary has no worries.

02:04:24.915 --> 02:04:29.752
Sir, if he has no worries, why then has
he retreated to his place on Long Island?

02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:33.673
Far from retreating, he's busy preparing
his attack on the questions...

02:04:33.841 --> 02:04:35.675
...he will be asked by the committee.

02:04:35.843 --> 02:04:38.386
I'd call them accusations
more than questions, sir.

02:04:38.554 --> 02:04:41.222
-The secretary has no worries.
But the public does.

02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:45.935
Particularly in view of the rumors
about rigged contracts, bribery...

02:04:46.103 --> 02:04:50.565
...the international Mafia. Especially
those dealing with the illegal use...

02:04:50.733 --> 02:04:53.610
...of the Transport union
pension funds.

02:04:53.777 --> 02:04:56.112
Could you tell us anything about that?

02:04:56.280 --> 02:05:02.118
Gentlemen, I deny all of these rumors
and allegations against my organization.

02:05:02.286 --> 02:05:06.748
Our hands have always been
and will continue to remain clean.

02:05:06.916 --> 02:05:12.462
In my entire life, I've fought to keep
the American labor movement clear--

02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:13.671
Him, I know.

02:05:13.839 --> 02:05:16.758
--forced speculation,
criminal elements...

02:05:16.926 --> 02:05:21.638
...or corrupt politicians.
If any mistakes have been made--

02:05:21.805 --> 02:05:24.933
He's still giving out
the same old bullshit.

02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:31.439
If any guilt at all exists
in this situation, it lies elsewhere.

02:06:10.604 --> 02:06:15.191
What's this I've been reading
about you in the newspapers? Hm?

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:21.781
Inflammatory words from a union boss?

02:06:26.161 --> 02:06:31.416
You still aren't gonna stop
the workers or the social movement.

02:06:31.959 --> 02:06:35.211
Listen to me, you socialist asshole!

02:06:35.379 --> 02:06:40.717
We don't give a good fart about the
socialist workers and their movements.

02:06:40.884 --> 02:06:45.888
We just want you out of the factory so
we can get the furnaces working again.

02:06:46.056 --> 02:06:49.058
This is the last offer
you're gonna get.

02:06:49.226 --> 02:06:52.270
You want to sign it or what?

02:06:58.152 --> 02:07:01.446
Tell your bosses they can
wipe their ass with it.

02:07:07.828 --> 02:07:09.162
Fill her up.

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.563
This is my last--

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:46.282
Hold it, boys. Don't shoot.

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:49.786
It's me, Crowning.

02:08:02.716 --> 02:08:05.468
-Crowning.
-Yeah.

02:08:05.636 --> 02:08:07.303
That'll do, boys.

02:08:07.471 --> 02:08:09.305
What'll do?

02:08:09.473 --> 02:08:12.767
We almost got the kid
where we want him.

02:08:16.605 --> 02:08:19.691
And we got the boss where we want him.

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:21.442
Easy.

02:08:22.486 --> 02:08:24.487
Easy.

02:08:27.825 --> 02:08:30.159
Put them down.

02:08:30.911 --> 02:08:33.496
Put your guns away, boys.

02:08:43.298 --> 02:08:45.383
Just swapping prisoners.

02:08:46.009 --> 02:08:48.636
Fair trade, huh, chickenhead?

02:08:56.019 --> 02:08:59.188
Union boy over here for Mr. Boss Man.

02:08:59.356 --> 02:09:01.899
Well, look who's here. Ha, ha.

02:09:02.651 --> 02:09:05.403
Fat Moe's boneyard boys.

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:07.655
Which reminds me.

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:11.826
How's that cancer in your gut
coming along, Chicken Joe?

02:09:13.996 --> 02:09:17.790
-Untie him.
-I don't take orders from you.

02:09:17.958 --> 02:09:21.127
We're not asking you to take orders, Joe.
We're telling you.

02:09:21.295 --> 02:09:23.463
Now go ahead, untie him.

02:09:23.630 --> 02:09:25.631
Untie him.

02:09:30.512 --> 02:09:31.637
Untie him.

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.921
Who are you?

02:10:05.923 --> 02:10:06.964
Who's paying you?

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:11.052
I think this is really gonna
piss you off there, Mac.

02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:14.764
I think it's those dirty, dirty
politician friends of yours.

02:10:14.932 --> 02:10:19.560
Yeah? Well, you crawl back and tell
him we don't want you in with us.

02:10:19.728 --> 02:10:23.481
Our fight's got nothing to do with
liquor and prostitution and dope.

02:10:23.649 --> 02:10:26.526
You'd better
get used to the idea, pal.

02:10:27.236 --> 02:10:29.111
This country is still growing up.

02:10:29.279 --> 02:10:33.199
Certain diseases it's better
to have when you're still young.

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:39.789
You boys ain't a mild case
of the measles. You're the plague.

02:10:39.957 --> 02:10:41.999
And bastards like him are immune.

02:10:42.167 --> 02:10:45.461
That's the difference
between us and them!

02:10:47.297 --> 02:10:49.131
Take it easy.

02:10:49.299 --> 02:10:51.300
The difference is that
they're always gonna win...

02:10:51.468 --> 02:10:54.053
...and you're gonna
keep getting it up the ass.

02:10:54.221 --> 02:10:56.180
Sooner than you think.

02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:17.702
Chief Aiello, moving policemen into
the factory came as a surprise to everyone:

02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:20.580
The press, the unions,
especially the strikers.

02:11:20.747 --> 02:11:23.332
Well, what did you want, sweetheart,
a declaration of war?

02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:25.251
Ours was a peaceable operation.

02:11:25.419 --> 02:11:27.795
Wasn't that contrary
to new union laws?

02:11:27.963 --> 02:11:30.172
I'm chief of police,
not chief of the people.

02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:32.675
Was there any violence by the strikers
to justify--?

02:11:32.843 --> 02:11:36.512
My motto is:
"Prevention, not repression."

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:38.764
But you let scabs move in
and start working.

02:11:38.932 --> 02:11:42.310
Young lady, you wanna talk to me,
call them "unemployed workers."

02:11:43.645 --> 02:11:48.024
With your permission, I'll take these
flowers to my missis before they wilt.

02:11:48.692 --> 02:11:52.653
Or maybe you heard.
I'm the father of a baby boy!

02:11:54.865 --> 02:11:57.366
Chief, one more question.

02:11:57.534 --> 02:12:01.996
We heard he's the youngest stockholder
in that factory you occupied.

02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:08.669
What'd you mean by that?

02:12:08.837 --> 02:12:12.006
They say management expressed their
thanks with a birthday present for the baby.

02:12:16.428 --> 02:12:19.055
You know,
slander is a serious offense.

02:12:19.222 --> 02:12:21.474
Especially when it comes
from a hack reporter.

02:12:21.975 --> 02:12:24.727
You wanna find out how serious?

02:12:26.855 --> 02:12:31.859
But since this is my first boy
after four girls...

02:12:32.027 --> 02:12:34.570
...I'll declare amnesty.

02:12:35.364 --> 02:12:38.574
Ha-ha-ha. Behave yourself.

02:12:39.952 --> 02:12:41.869
Go.

02:14:53.085 --> 02:14:56.087
Thank you. Oh.

02:14:56.254 --> 02:14:57.838
-He's eating?
-Mm-hm.

02:14:58.006 --> 02:15:01.425
-For five.
-For five? Well, why not?

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:04.386
You could feed an army with
these two milk plants. Ha-ha-ha.

02:15:04.554 --> 02:15:05.846
We could open up a dairy.

02:15:09.267 --> 02:15:10.726
Oh, hey.

02:15:12.604 --> 02:15:18.400
Who loves you? Who loves you?
I love you.

02:15:18.568 --> 02:15:22.404
And I love you.
And I love you.

02:15:22.572 --> 02:15:24.198
Lucy!

02:15:24.366 --> 02:15:26.408
-Don't you have to feed him at 6:00?
Uh-huh.

02:15:27.786 --> 02:15:29.203
Come in.

02:15:30.914 --> 02:15:34.500
-Oh, here he is now.
-That's my son.

02:15:34.668 --> 02:15:38.629
That's my son. Oh, oh.

02:15:40.799 --> 02:15:46.428
That's my son. That's my son!
Ha-ha-ha.

02:15:46.596 --> 02:15:48.347
Jesus Christ, they change fast.

02:15:49.933 --> 02:15:52.560
Yeah, but he looks like my old man.

02:15:52.727 --> 02:15:54.603
Yeah, yeah, look, same eyes.

02:15:54.771 --> 02:15:57.148
And look at that,
the same devilish pride, huh?

02:15:57.315 --> 02:16:00.192
Hey. Hey, hey.

02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:01.902
Did you see his dickey?

02:16:02.070 --> 02:16:03.946
-Vincent.
What?

02:16:04.114 --> 02:16:06.448
-The girls.
-The girls!

02:16:06.616 --> 02:16:12.538
Sooner or later you have to learn that
after me, the boss in the house is him.

02:16:12.706 --> 02:16:14.498
He's got balls just like his papa.

02:16:14.666 --> 02:16:15.916
-Whoa! Hey!
-Let me have him.

02:16:16.084 --> 02:16:19.712
No, no, no. I'll do this.

02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:21.755
I'll do this, huh? Yeah.

02:16:25.093 --> 02:16:27.094
Look. Hey, hey.

02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:31.265
Ooh. Ha-ha-ha.

02:16:31.766 --> 02:16:33.100
Let Papa change you, huh?

02:16:33.268 --> 02:16:35.477
Come on, look.
Give me your little-bitty smile.

02:16:35.645 --> 02:16:40.523
Come on, come on, come on.

02:16:41.902 --> 02:16:42.942
What the fuck is this?

02:16:44.279 --> 02:16:49.450
-What is this? Huh? What's that?
No! No! Oh, no!

02:16:49.993 --> 02:16:52.244
-Look.
-It's the right number.

02:16:52.412 --> 02:16:55.748
The right number?
I'll break your goddamn neck!

02:16:55.915 --> 02:16:58.334
Find my son, or I'll burn down
this goddamn building!

02:16:59.669 --> 02:17:02.254
Hello! Hello.

02:17:02.422 --> 02:17:03.672
-Would you shut up?
-Oh!

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:08.177
No, hey, no. Wait, wait.
I'm not talking to you.

02:17:08.344 --> 02:17:10.554
Well, who's this?

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:13.139
Never mind--
To who am I talking?

02:17:13.308 --> 02:17:16.101
Who the hell are you?
My son, where is he?

02:17:16.269 --> 02:17:20.314
Where the hell do you think he is?
He's in the maternity ward. He never left.

02:17:20.482 --> 02:17:23.816
He just got a little restless
so he wanted to change his bed.

02:17:23.985 --> 02:17:27.696
And the other kids got the same idea
so they also wanted to change their beds.

02:17:27.864 --> 02:17:31.659
So there you got 30, 40 screaming babies
jumping from one bed to another...

02:17:31.825 --> 02:17:35.245
...switching tags, so now
we do have a real problem.

02:17:35.413 --> 02:17:38.499
Piece of shit whoever you are!
What the fuck are you saying?

02:17:38.666 --> 02:17:40.000
-Huh?
-...can't find my son!

02:17:40.168 --> 02:17:41.209
Oh, no, no, no.

02:17:41.378 --> 02:17:44.296
Luckily we were there to see that
everything was under control.

02:17:44.464 --> 02:17:46.882
If you want, we can put everything
back where it was.

02:17:47.049 --> 02:17:48.424
Except there's one problem.

02:17:48.593 --> 02:17:51.053
-You gotta meet us halfway.
-Halfway. Tell me!

02:17:51.221 --> 02:17:53.305
Why do you care who wins the strike?

02:17:53.473 --> 02:17:55.766
That's got nothing to do with me!
What did I do?

02:17:55.933 --> 02:17:58.519
What did you do?
First of all, you let the scabs in.

02:17:58.687 --> 02:18:01.313
Second of all, you got the cops in there
protecting them.

02:18:01.481 --> 02:18:04.858
-That's my right. I'm a cop!
-All right, shut the fuck up.

02:18:05.026 --> 02:18:07.027
Now, listen to me very carefully.

02:18:07.195 --> 02:18:11.198
You're gonna call off your dogs and let
the strikers work it out with the bosses.

02:18:11.366 --> 02:18:12.407
I want my son back now.

02:18:12.575 --> 02:18:15.119
Do that,
we'll give you your kid's new number.

02:18:15.287 --> 02:18:18.121
You don't do that, look for your kid
yourself, and good luck.

02:18:19.457 --> 02:18:21.000
-So, what is it gonna be?
-Okay.

02:18:21.166 --> 02:18:24.169
-I'll call my men off today.
-Attaboy.

02:18:24.337 --> 02:18:27.505
You know, Aiello, for a rotten,
rat-bastard son of a bitch...

02:18:27.674 --> 02:18:29.466
...you're not as stupid as I thought.

02:18:31.261 --> 02:18:33.429
-We'll be in touch.
-When will you call?

02:18:33.596 --> 02:18:36.807
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll be in touch with you.

02:18:36.975 --> 02:18:38.267
-Bye.
-I gotta know--

02:18:42.314 --> 02:18:43.897
-So?
-We got a deal.

02:18:49.029 --> 02:18:51.280
-To a very smooth talker.
-Yeah.

02:18:51.448 --> 02:18:54.074
-Mazel.
At least.

02:18:54.242 --> 02:18:56.869
-Peggeleh.
-Noodles.

02:19:01.915 --> 02:19:03.959
Where's that switch list?

02:19:04.127 --> 02:19:06.545
The switch list?
-Yeah.

02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:09.590
-I can't find it.
What?

02:19:09.758 --> 02:19:11.842
I can't find it.

02:19:12.802 --> 02:19:15.846
-What'd you do with it?
-I think I dumped it with that jacket.

02:19:16.013 --> 02:19:17.598
What a yutz.

02:19:17.766 --> 02:19:19.933
Oh, Pat.
Wait a minute, listen.

02:19:20.101 --> 02:19:22.936
Listen, Noodles,
Noodles, wait. I remember.

02:19:23.103 --> 02:19:27.023
The boys' numbers was odd-- Was even,
and the girls' numbers was odd.

02:19:27.191 --> 02:19:29.317
-That's very simple.
-You took good stock.

02:19:29.486 --> 02:19:31.736
Hey, know what?
Let's give him an even number.

02:19:31.905 --> 02:19:34.239
Uh, eight. Let's pick an eight.

02:19:34.491 --> 02:19:35.616
Eight.

02:19:38.495 --> 02:19:40.037
Yeah, it's a good number.

02:19:40.205 --> 02:19:43.082
Wait a minute. What about
the other little pischers?

02:19:44.041 --> 02:19:46.126
We're better than fate.

02:19:46.294 --> 02:19:49.171
We give some the good life,
give it to others up the ass.

02:19:52.342 --> 02:19:55.803
All right, boys, let's settle up.
It's Saturday.

02:19:55.970 --> 02:19:59.264
Settle-shmettle, Peggy,
I'm gonna take mine out in trade.

02:19:59.432 --> 02:20:00.808
Oh, you're such a nudge.

02:20:02.477 --> 02:20:06.647
Hey, you know what?
I wish I was switched when I was a kid.

02:20:06.815 --> 02:20:08.565
What makes you think you weren't?

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:26.708
I don't believe it.

02:20:27.377 --> 02:20:31.255
Hey, you guys, come here.
Take a look at who's over here.

02:20:31.423 --> 02:20:33.715
-That suit you, Peg?
Okay, fine, Max.

02:20:33.883 --> 02:20:36.427
-What have you got?
-Over there.

02:20:38.888 --> 02:20:40.806
Well, what--?

02:20:46.062 --> 02:20:50.232
Holy shit! Noodles, Noodles!
Come here, come here.

02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:52.067
Look.

02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:56.488
The blond by the piano.

02:20:59.993 --> 02:21:02.119
-Yeah, who's that? Yeah.
-Who's that?

02:21:02.287 --> 02:21:04.329
You and this broad were
practically engaged.

02:21:04.497 --> 02:21:05.664
Ooh.

02:21:05.832 --> 02:21:10.878
Beat me. Ooh, beat me. Ooh, I love it.
Ha, ha.

02:21:11.045 --> 02:21:13.547
-Who was it? The Detroit cock-squasher?
Yeah.

02:21:13.715 --> 02:21:16.091
Peggy.
Not her, she looks different.

02:21:16.259 --> 02:21:19.595
You know that platinum blond
in the flower dress? She's by the table.

02:21:19.762 --> 02:21:22.181
See her? Call her in, will you?

02:21:28.813 --> 02:21:30.272
-Carol.
-Carol, whatever.

02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:34.443
Just tell her there's a bunch of her
old friends here, you know what I mean?

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:37.738
Carol.

02:21:37.906 --> 02:21:39.781
Carol!

02:21:44.787 --> 02:21:47.164
Noodles, pfft, come here.

02:21:50.376 --> 02:21:53.795
-Somebody here wants to see you.
-Who?

02:21:54.547 --> 02:21:56.256
You know these guys?

02:21:58.676 --> 02:22:00.552
No.

02:22:01.971 --> 02:22:04.431
I don't think so.

02:22:08.269 --> 02:22:09.770
No. Ha, ha.

02:22:09.938 --> 02:22:13.732
No. I'd remember a bunch
of good-lookers like these.

02:22:31.251 --> 02:22:34.920
Oh, well, how could I forget?

02:22:41.177 --> 02:22:43.554
There was, uh....

02:22:43.721 --> 02:22:49.351
There was only one of you
I got to know personally, though.

02:22:51.104 --> 02:22:52.813
Which one?

02:22:52.981 --> 02:22:56.233
Let's see how good
a memory you've got for faces.

02:23:16.546 --> 02:23:18.964
You.

02:23:19.132 --> 02:23:21.049
No.

02:23:21.301 --> 02:23:22.551
Him.

02:23:22.719 --> 02:23:26.305
We've been hanging out so long
together, we're starting to look alike.

02:23:26.472 --> 02:23:28.473
"Hanging out"?

02:23:38.693 --> 02:23:41.320
Charmed.

02:23:58.546 --> 02:24:00.547
You can call me Carol.

02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:14.311
We've already met.

02:24:32.538 --> 02:24:34.623
Pleasure.

02:24:35.667 --> 02:24:37.793
The pleasure...

02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:40.212
...is all mine.

02:24:50.348 --> 02:24:53.058
Mmm.

02:25:07.198 --> 02:25:10.075
So you left Detroit, huh?

02:25:10.243 --> 02:25:12.744
No, her and her husband
just come in on the weekends.

02:25:12.912 --> 02:25:15.163
Yeah, it beats the seashore.

02:25:16.124 --> 02:25:20.210
Well, she takes on maybe 10 guys and
her hubby watches through the peephole.

02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:22.504
Beats the hell out of the movies.

02:25:22.672 --> 02:25:25.298
I wonder what that jerk is up to
in his cubbyhole now.

02:25:25.466 --> 02:25:27.759
He must be wondering,
where is his fucking wife?

02:25:35.810 --> 02:25:39.604
Why don't we make it a threesome, huh?

02:25:39.772 --> 02:25:42.899
Can't you see he's got
other plans for tonight?

02:25:43.067 --> 02:25:47.154
Well, bring her along.
We'll make it a foursome.

02:25:51.451 --> 02:25:54.619
I'm not that kind of guy.

02:25:54.787 --> 02:25:59.624
Besides, I'm afraid if I give you a good
crack in the mouth, you'd probably like it.

02:26:13.014 --> 02:26:15.474
Have a good night, fellas.

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:18.059
See you later.

02:26:31.157 --> 02:26:34.242
-Been waiting long?
-All my life.

02:26:54.514 --> 02:26:59.017
You wanted a place by the ocean so I had
it opened. It was closed for the season.

02:26:59.185 --> 02:27:01.978
All these tables are for two people.

02:27:02.313 --> 02:27:04.773
Pick whatever one you want.

02:27:36.305 --> 02:27:37.931
I like this one.

02:27:38.099 --> 02:27:40.225
Here, sit down.

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:53.321
Oh, I'll have the asperges sauce
vinaigrette and then a ChÃ¢teaubriand.

02:27:56.784 --> 02:27:58.660
I'll decide later.

02:27:58.828 --> 02:28:01.413
-Monsieur?
-I'll have the same.

02:28:02.498 --> 02:28:04.332
For the wine?

02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:06.751
You decide.
I'll just have water.

02:28:06.919 --> 02:28:10.881
-You decide.
-Thank you.

02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:19.639
You've been around.

02:28:20.808 --> 02:28:24.144
Where'd you learn all them
"parlez-vous franÃ§ais" dishes?

02:28:24.312 --> 02:28:25.812
Who's teaching you that stuff?

02:28:27.189 --> 02:28:30.442
You mean a sugar daddy
who tries to teach me how to act?

02:28:32.862 --> 02:28:34.404
I read books. I learn everything.

02:28:34.572 --> 02:28:38.241
I want to know everything.
Doesn't it make sense to have plans?

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:41.828
Yeah, it does.

02:28:42.330 --> 02:28:45.540
What about me? Am I in these plans?

02:28:47.668 --> 02:28:49.377
Noodles....

02:28:50.796 --> 02:28:54.341
You're the only person that I have ever--

02:28:54.508 --> 02:28:57.677
Ever what? Go ahead.

02:28:59.096 --> 02:29:01.097
Ever what?

02:29:01.682 --> 02:29:04.225
That I ever cared about.

02:29:04.602 --> 02:29:08.271
But you'd lock me up and you'd
throw away the key, wouldn't you?

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:14.611
Yeah.

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:17.364
Yeah, I guess so.

02:29:17.531 --> 02:29:19.658
Yeah.

02:29:19.825 --> 02:29:23.119
And the thing is,
I probably wouldn't even mind.

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:30.293
-So?
-So I got to get to where I'm going.

02:29:30.461 --> 02:29:33.254
-And where's that?
-To the top.

02:29:36.968 --> 02:29:39.719
Now you sound just like Maxie.

02:29:40.262 --> 02:29:43.640
Youse are both alike,
that's why you hate each other so much.

02:29:43.808 --> 02:29:46.017
Do you want me to leave?

02:29:51.065 --> 02:29:53.608
No, I don't want you to leave.

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:18.591
You dancing?

02:30:19.093 --> 02:30:20.719
-You asking?
-I'm asking.

02:30:20.886 --> 02:30:22.971
I'm dancing.

02:31:35.753 --> 02:31:40.465
To keep from going crazy,
you have to cut yourself off from the world.

02:31:40.633 --> 02:31:43.259
Just not think about it.
You have to, uh....

02:31:43.427 --> 02:31:46.721
You know, years that went by,
it seemed like...

02:31:46.889 --> 02:31:50.183
...no time at all,
because you're not doing anything.

02:31:50.351 --> 02:31:53.895
But there were two things I couldn't
get out of my mind. One was Dominic.

02:31:54.063 --> 02:31:57.607
The way he said "I slipped"
just before he died.

02:31:58.901 --> 02:32:01.152
The other was you.

02:32:07.368 --> 02:32:11.579
How you used to read me
your Song of Songs, remember?

02:32:13.374 --> 02:32:17.836
How beautiful are your feet
in sandals, O prince's daughter.

02:32:21.465 --> 02:32:26.636
I used to read the Bible every night.
Every night I used to think about you.

02:32:28.889 --> 02:32:33.601
Your navel is a bowl,
well-rounded with no lack of wine.

02:32:33.769 --> 02:32:37.647
Your belly, a heap of wheat
surrounded with lilies.

02:32:37.815 --> 02:32:40.233
Your breasts...

02:32:41.777 --> 02:32:44.237
...clusters of grapes.

02:32:44.947 --> 02:32:49.284
Your breath, sweet-scented as apples.

02:32:56.876 --> 02:32:59.961
Nobody's gonna love you
the way I loved you.

02:33:04.466 --> 02:33:07.969
There were times I couldn't stand it
anymore. I used to think about you.

02:33:08.137 --> 02:33:12.223
I'd think, "Deborah lives.
She's out there. She exists."

02:33:12.391 --> 02:33:14.893
And that would get me through it all.

02:33:17.438 --> 02:33:19.981
You know how important
that was to me?

02:33:26.238 --> 02:33:28.865
Noodles, I'm leaving tomorrow
to go to Hollywood.

02:33:29.033 --> 02:33:31.826
I wanted to see you tonight
to tell you.

02:35:25.941 --> 02:35:27.608
No.

02:35:28.068 --> 02:35:29.652
No! I--

02:35:30.279 --> 02:35:33.072
No! No. Ah!

02:35:36.702 --> 02:35:41.789
No. Please, no. No, please. No!

02:35:41.957 --> 02:35:47.253
No! Oh, no! No, please!

02:35:47.421 --> 02:35:52.592
No, no! Please, no, no. No.

02:35:55.888 --> 02:35:57.638
No!

02:37:32.526 --> 02:37:34.193
Deborah. Deborah.

02:37:34.361 --> 02:37:36.737
Get away! Get away!

02:37:53.672 --> 02:37:55.631
I'll be right back.

02:38:27.372 --> 02:38:29.165
Take her home.

02:38:30.083 --> 02:38:31.918
Take her home.

02:40:05.178 --> 02:40:07.805
All aboard!

02:42:28.488 --> 02:42:30.030
Well...

02:42:30.699 --> 02:42:32.908
...look who's back.

02:42:34.202 --> 02:42:35.953
What's this?

02:42:39.458 --> 02:42:41.208
It's a throne.

02:42:43.378 --> 02:42:45.755
It was a gift to a pope.

02:42:46.631 --> 02:42:51.010
-Cost me 800 bucks.
-It's from the 17th century.

02:43:00.270 --> 02:43:02.730
So, what are you doing with it?

02:43:05.567 --> 02:43:07.443
I'm sitting on it.

02:43:15.744 --> 02:43:18.913
-You got any coffee around?
Yeah, sure.

02:43:30.759 --> 02:43:32.426
Thanks.

02:44:47.335 --> 02:44:48.836
Hm.

02:44:50.338 --> 02:44:55.092
While you were on vacation,
we were working overtime.

02:45:02.267 --> 02:45:04.393
The union paid off.

02:45:07.272 --> 02:45:09.315
That's your share.

02:45:10.442 --> 02:45:14.737
Yeah. Even that geek.
You know, Jimmy "Clean Hands"...

02:45:14.905 --> 02:45:20.701
...respects us.
Eh, I shed a little blood for the cause.

02:45:20.869 --> 02:45:23.287
Yeah, it's all in the papers.

02:45:23.455 --> 02:45:27.583
Morning Telegraph, they didn't like it.

02:45:27.751 --> 02:45:32.588
It says, "Underworld joins strikers
in brutal battle."

02:45:32.756 --> 02:45:36.550
But The Post, they liked it.

02:45:36.718 --> 02:45:40.429
"Ends justify means
in decisive gangland encounter."

02:45:40.847 --> 02:45:43.766
And they're the ones that kvetched
about the Atlantic City job.

02:45:43.934 --> 02:45:47.937
Heh. Newspaper guys never know
what the fuck they want.

02:45:54.861 --> 02:45:58.238
-Well, you could have looked for me.
We did.

02:45:59.574 --> 02:46:02.034
Cockeye found you at the Chink's.

02:46:02.202 --> 02:46:04.954
So fucking doped up
you didn't even recognize him.

02:46:05.163 --> 02:46:10.334
Yeah, you were. Heh.
You called me "Deborah." Ha-ha-ha.

02:46:12.087 --> 02:46:14.421
Hey, go fuck yourself.
Mind your own business.

02:46:14.589 --> 02:46:18.884
We do our business together
and fucking broads do not get in the way...

02:46:19.052 --> 02:46:20.344
-...and you know it!
Yeah?

02:46:20.512 --> 02:46:22.763
-Yeah.
-Then what's she doing here?

02:46:24.057 --> 02:46:27.977
Today ain't Saturday. She should be in
Detroit, screwing on the assembly line.

02:46:28.144 --> 02:46:30.771
Well, she's screwing here now.

02:46:30.939 --> 02:46:34.650
And only with Max.

02:46:35.276 --> 02:46:37.236
Oh, yeah?

02:46:37.404 --> 02:46:41.991
-With her husband peeping through?
-No, I left him.

02:46:46.037 --> 02:46:49.790
You live with her, bring her here,
and you tell me not to mess with broads.

02:46:49.958 --> 02:46:51.709
-You forget one thing.
What?

02:46:51.876 --> 02:46:54.044
-I don't give a fuck about her.
-Max--

02:46:54.212 --> 02:46:57.464
Shut up! Shut up! Shh!
Maxie, tell me something.

02:46:57.632 --> 02:46:59.466
What'll you spend your honeymoon on?

02:46:59.634 --> 02:47:03.679
-Maxie--
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

02:47:04.973 --> 02:47:07.057
Just shut up!

02:47:11.521 --> 02:47:13.522
You want me to dump her?

02:47:13.982 --> 02:47:15.899
You want me to kick her
out of here?

02:47:17.986 --> 02:47:20.320
Want me to kick her ass out or what?

02:47:20.488 --> 02:47:25.242
You want me to kick--? Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out! Get out!

02:47:32.292 --> 02:47:35.127
You gonna tell me I don't have
a way with women? Ha-ha-ha.

02:47:47.974 --> 02:47:50.476
-Hello.
This is Jimmy. Who's this, Max?

02:47:50.643 --> 02:47:52.686
No, it's Noodles.

02:47:55.023 --> 02:47:59.026
Okay, listen.
We're gonna need you guys today.

02:47:59.194 --> 02:48:02.446
I'm gonna be making
a tough speech, and I think you--

02:48:13.083 --> 02:48:15.125
Go, go!

02:48:36.397 --> 02:48:39.650
Start the engine.
I'll be right with you.

02:48:39.818 --> 02:48:44.071
Mr. Gallagher wants you to know
how much he appreciates what you did.

02:48:44.239 --> 02:48:46.657
To show his appreciation....

02:48:57.085 --> 02:49:00.212
Here's an envelope
for the both of youse.

02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:05.092
If we gotta complete the job,
I'll let you know.

02:49:41.212 --> 02:49:42.379
Whoa! Whoa!

02:49:42.797 --> 02:49:44.923
Wiped out by a blast of Cordon Rouge.

02:49:45.091 --> 02:49:47.718
What would Crowning
and his bosses say after that, eh?

02:49:47.886 --> 02:49:50.804
Never be afraid of you, then,
would they?

02:49:50.972 --> 02:49:55.726
They're still not afraid of me.
It was you boys that scared them off.

02:49:55.977 --> 02:50:00.355
And you didn't want these guys.
Aren't you lucky you got party leaders...

02:50:00.523 --> 02:50:02.816
...like myself who care about the union?

02:50:02.984 --> 02:50:07.321
Hey, the strike is settled. We won.
That's what counts. Am I right, Jim?

02:50:07.488 --> 02:50:11.283
It was tough for Jimmy not to be there
to sign the contract though, huh, Jim?

02:50:11.451 --> 02:50:12.993
No.

02:50:14.662 --> 02:50:19.499
What's tough is, you boys did more in
a night than I could in two years of talking.

02:50:19.667 --> 02:50:21.877
Forget it.
To the hottest newcomer...

02:50:22.045 --> 02:50:24.046
-...in American unions.
There you go.

02:50:24.214 --> 02:50:26.298
Jimmy Conway.
Now you're talking.

02:50:26.466 --> 02:50:27.883
Roll out the barrel.

02:50:28.051 --> 02:50:32.346
May God bless.
Drink up. Suck it right down.

02:50:32.513 --> 02:50:36.308
You must be crazy giving
him drinks. We're going to operate.

02:50:36.476 --> 02:50:41.438
Oh, what's the rush? They already told me
I'd be a gimp for the rest of my life.

02:50:41.606 --> 02:50:46.777
Don't worry, Jimmy, with one leg
a little shy, you're gonna take giant steps.

02:50:46.945 --> 02:50:51.073
Yeah. And always one step
right behind you, Sharkey?

02:50:51.241 --> 02:50:53.951
Make sure they work on
the right leg, Jim.

02:50:54.118 --> 02:50:56.411
-It's only blood, huh?
-Mazel.

02:51:04.295 --> 02:51:09.299
You boys got yourself a real martyr
for a friend. Make it work for you.

02:51:09.467 --> 02:51:12.678
Yeah, but what the hell are we
gonna do with a martyr?

02:51:12.845 --> 02:51:17.057
Times change. Prohibition ain't gonna
last much longer. Take it from me...

02:51:17.225 --> 02:51:23.563
-...a lot of you guys will be out of work.
-Go on, Mr. Sharkey. We're interested.

02:51:24.983 --> 02:51:28.527
You ever think of setting
yourselves up in business?

02:51:28.903 --> 02:51:33.657
All those trucks they're using to haul
liquor, soon be selling them for nothing.

02:51:33.825 --> 02:51:39.079
I'm talking about hundreds of vehicles
controlled by a national organization...

02:51:39.247 --> 02:51:42.833
...and supported by a powerful union
headed by Jimmy Conway.

02:51:43.001 --> 02:51:47.087
Whatever you ask,
there's no way he can turn you down.

02:51:47.755 --> 02:51:49.798
You gotta be kidding, Sharkey.

02:51:52.010 --> 02:51:55.345
Jimmy "Clean Hands"
in business with us?

02:51:55.972 --> 02:51:59.474
They won't be clean for long,
with the hands he's gonna shake.

02:51:59.642 --> 02:52:02.269
Everything in good time.

02:52:17.118 --> 02:52:21.121
-We're not interested.
-What's the matter, you got a problem?

02:52:21.289 --> 02:52:24.958
We got plenty of money tucked away.
Why not invest it? What is the problem?

02:52:25.126 --> 02:52:29.421
I'll put the party behind you.
And I got friends in high places.

02:52:30.965 --> 02:52:34.217
I'm not interested in your friends,
and I don't trust politicians.

02:52:34.385 --> 02:52:36.970
You still think like
some schmuck from the streets.

02:52:37.138 --> 02:52:40.098
If we'd listened to you,
we'd still be rolling drunks.

02:52:40.266 --> 02:52:42.601
-Are you broke?
-Don't bust my balls.

02:52:42.769 --> 02:52:45.812
I am talking about real money.

02:52:46.314 --> 02:52:51.985
This is real money to me. It's a lot
of money. You want any of it?

02:52:52.445 --> 02:52:56.865
-You carry that stink of the streets.
-I like the stink. It makes me feel good.

02:52:57.033 --> 02:53:00.535
I like the smell of it.
It opens up my lungs.

02:53:01.245 --> 02:53:03.330
And it gives me a hard-on.

02:53:03.498 --> 02:53:05.832
You're carrying dead weight, Maxie.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:09.252
One of these days,
you're gonna have to dump it.

02:53:12.882 --> 02:53:15.675
Maxie. Let me know
when you're gonna dump me.

02:53:15.843 --> 02:53:19.429
Meanwhile, I'll take a vacation in Florida.
I got a yen for the seashore.

02:53:42.412 --> 02:53:44.121
Hey.

02:53:45.998 --> 02:53:48.875
Listen, I was thinking it over and, um....

02:53:50.211 --> 02:53:54.256
I guess I kind of got a yen
for the seashore myself.

02:53:59.887 --> 02:54:01.471
You wanna go swimming?

02:54:02.348 --> 02:54:06.518
Yeah. Yeah, let's go for a swim.

02:54:23.327 --> 02:54:26.955
Read all about it! Read all about it!

02:54:28.916 --> 02:54:31.418
Read all about it!

02:55:45.993 --> 02:55:47.953
Hey, Maxie.

02:55:48.538 --> 02:55:50.914
-Max.
-Huh?

02:55:51.082 --> 02:55:53.833
How much money we got put away?

02:55:54.085 --> 02:55:55.502
Why?

02:55:58.339 --> 02:56:00.757
Because we're unemployed.

02:56:15.815 --> 02:56:18.316
About a million bucks.

02:56:18.818 --> 02:56:23.530
-Oh, yeah? Where'd you put it?
-In my underwear.

02:56:25.658 --> 02:56:29.369
-I'd have found it there.
-Hey.

02:56:29.704 --> 02:56:31.288
Huh?

02:56:56.564 --> 02:57:01.109
We gotta reorganize, Max.
And I got a couple of good ideas.

02:57:02.486 --> 02:57:04.195
Me too.

02:57:04.488 --> 02:57:07.532
If I had a million bucks,
I'd take it easy.

02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:10.076
We'll take it easy when we got 20.

02:57:11.454 --> 02:57:14.789
-Fifty.
Where you gonna get that?

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:19.794
Right here.

02:57:29.138 --> 02:57:30.889
What's that?

02:57:34.310 --> 02:57:36.227
It's a dream.

02:57:38.648 --> 02:57:41.399
A dream I've been dreaming
all my life.

02:57:41.567 --> 02:57:45.695
I swear to God, Noodles, you and me
together, we can make it come true.

02:57:49.617 --> 02:57:50.825
What is it?

02:57:56.123 --> 02:57:57.957
The Federal Reserve Bank.

02:58:01.671 --> 02:58:05.131
It's the biggest step
we can take, Noodles.

02:58:28.197 --> 02:58:30.031
You're really crazy.

02:58:31.242 --> 02:58:35.912
Don't you ever say that to me.
Don't you ever say that to me again!

03:00:01.665 --> 03:00:06.544
What chance is there that
a crazy thing like this might succeed, hm?

03:00:07.755 --> 03:00:09.672
Don't ask me, ask Max.

03:00:10.090 --> 03:00:15.929
You know as well as I do that this is
suicide, pure and simple, for everyone.

03:00:16.680 --> 03:00:22.101
Yeah, well, don't tell me, tell him.
You got your own methods.

03:00:22.728 --> 03:00:24.896
Yeah, I tried.

03:00:25.356 --> 03:00:28.441
He doesn't want to screw anymore.

03:00:31.403 --> 03:00:34.739
All he thinks about is this job.

03:00:37.243 --> 03:00:40.328
Tear gas, hostages,
now he's gonna do this.

03:00:40.496 --> 03:00:43.915
He's gonna do it with or without you.

03:00:49.171 --> 03:00:52.590
Noodles, we've never liked each other.

03:00:56.887 --> 03:01:02.517
We put up with each other for Max's sake.
So why don't we just get together once...

03:01:02.685 --> 03:01:05.436
...and do something for him?

03:01:15.155 --> 03:01:17.115
And after that...

03:01:18.158 --> 03:01:21.327
...we can go back to being enemies.

03:01:29.837 --> 03:01:34.883
You know,
if you were all in jail first...

03:01:35.050 --> 03:01:38.136
...there wouldn't be any bank job.

03:01:49.690 --> 03:01:52.358
I got the idea from your friend Max.

03:01:54.194 --> 03:01:55.403
What do you mean?

03:01:58.490 --> 03:02:01.826
He laughs at you. He makes fun of you.

03:02:03.662 --> 03:02:06.956
He says Eve has got you by the balls.

03:02:07.124 --> 03:02:11.044
Every time you walk past this place,
you shit in your pants.

03:02:11.211 --> 03:02:15.006
You'd do anything for the cops to pick
you up so you wouldn't have to do this job.

03:02:15.174 --> 03:02:17.258
Is that true, huh?

03:02:29.980 --> 03:02:31.564
Well, then do it.

03:02:31.732 --> 03:02:35.026
Do it. Put him in jail.
Put him in jail. Not long.

03:02:35.194 --> 03:02:39.072
Just long enough so he can
get the idea out of his mind.

03:02:40.866 --> 03:02:45.995
If you can't stand being away
from him, put yourself there too.

03:02:47.581 --> 03:02:50.500
Better off than being dead.

03:02:54.922 --> 03:02:57.215
You know what to do.

03:03:00.844 --> 03:03:03.680
And if you don't, I will.

03:03:07.518 --> 03:03:09.727
Get out. Take a cab.

03:03:09.895 --> 03:03:12.772
I'm busy. I got things to do. Get out.

03:03:18.320 --> 03:03:19.445
Noodles?

03:03:20.489 --> 03:03:23.408
Make up your mind fast, huh?

03:04:48.118 --> 03:04:50.203
What's the matter?

03:04:50.704 --> 03:04:53.206
Aren't you having a good time?

03:05:00.005 --> 03:05:02.590
Why are you going out tonight?

03:05:03.133 --> 03:05:06.385
Why bother now that prohibition
is almost over?

03:05:08.430 --> 03:05:12.350
Everybody's selling. We got friends who
have a lot of booze they wanna get rid of...

03:05:12.518 --> 03:05:16.979
...for practically nothing.
So we figure, why not?

03:05:23.153 --> 03:05:25.947
I'm gonna be gone for a while.

03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:29.158
I'll be waiting at the hotel.

03:05:29.993 --> 03:05:34.122
I like it when you come home
late and wake me up.

03:05:39.711 --> 03:05:41.921
I'm not gonna be home tonight.

03:05:48.929 --> 03:05:51.514
I'm not gonna be home tomorrow either.

03:05:51.932 --> 03:05:55.893
I thought these things
only take a couple of hours.

03:06:02.276 --> 03:06:08.197
Ladies and gents, I drink to the demise
of Fat Moe's speakeasy.

03:06:08.490 --> 03:06:10.950
Who the hell wants to drink
here legally anyway?

03:06:13.287 --> 03:06:16.789
Okay. Come on, Moe, set them up.
Go on, get in there.

03:06:30.179 --> 03:06:31.637
Here's another one.
Ha-ha-ha.

03:06:31.805 --> 03:06:34.056
Here's mud in your eye.

03:06:40.731 --> 03:06:42.231
Boys.

03:06:45.611 --> 03:06:47.737
Let's drink to our last shipment.

03:06:47.905 --> 03:06:50.740
Because there's more onboard
tonight than just booze.

03:06:50.908 --> 03:06:56.329
It's 10 years of our lives. Ten years
that were really worth living.

03:06:56.496 --> 03:06:57.872
Yeah.

03:07:06.048 --> 03:07:07.423
Aah.

03:07:16.350 --> 03:07:18.184
Noodles.

03:07:19.561 --> 03:07:21.145
Noodles.

03:07:22.856 --> 03:07:25.441
-L'chaim.
-L'chaim.

03:07:28.445 --> 03:07:31.030
How long will I have to wait?

03:07:34.701 --> 03:07:38.204
A year and a half, more or less.

03:07:39.581 --> 03:07:41.749
Six months off for good behavior.

03:07:42.209 --> 03:07:45.044
-What are you gonna do?
-Don't ask.

03:09:19.806 --> 03:09:21.640
Operator.

03:09:22.976 --> 03:09:24.143
Police, please.

03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:32.401
Fifth Precinct. Sergeant Halloran.

03:09:35.155 --> 03:09:36.697
Hello.

03:09:37.657 --> 03:09:40.743
Who's speaking? Can I help you?

03:09:40.911 --> 03:09:42.912
-Hello?
-Yeah.

03:09:45.499 --> 03:09:47.249
I got a good tip for you.

03:10:13.735 --> 03:10:17.530
Yeah, who is it?
Yeah, it's Max. Open the door.

03:10:23.412 --> 03:10:27.456
-What's the matter with you? You sick?
-No, I'm fine.

03:10:27.624 --> 03:10:29.291
You don't look it.

03:10:31.420 --> 03:10:34.255
Maybe you'd better
stay home tonight, huh?

03:10:34.756 --> 03:10:37.675
-Why?
-Heh.

03:10:40.137 --> 03:10:43.055
You know, I've been
watching you all night.

03:10:44.558 --> 03:10:47.393
And you've been drinking like a fish.

03:10:48.270 --> 03:10:50.688
Trying to get your courage up?

03:10:54.192 --> 03:10:57.486
We're only bringing in
a shipment of booze.

03:10:59.030 --> 03:11:02.241
It's got so you're even
scared to do that.

03:11:03.994 --> 03:11:06.745
Maybe you just better
stay home tonight.

03:11:07.789 --> 03:11:09.331
With Eve. Heh-heh-heh.

03:11:19.676 --> 03:11:24.096
Hey, Maxie, everywhere you go,
I go too. Remember that.

03:11:33.940 --> 03:11:36.400
Maybe Sharkey was right.

03:11:36.568 --> 03:11:39.361
Maybe I ought to just dump you.

03:11:48.497 --> 03:11:50.080
You're really crazy.

03:11:50.248 --> 03:11:52.166
Never say that!

03:11:52.626 --> 03:11:55.794
Don't say it!

03:12:02.594 --> 03:12:06.764
Max made fools of us, Noodles.
He wanted to die.

03:12:06.932 --> 03:12:09.975
Did you know his old man
died in the nut house?

03:12:10.143 --> 03:12:12.978
Max didn't want to
end up the same way.

03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:17.316
So he put the idea
in our heads to tip off the cops.

03:12:17.484 --> 03:12:22.363
And when they stopped the truck,
Max started shooting first...

03:12:22.531 --> 03:12:25.824
...just to get himself killed.

03:12:43.009 --> 03:12:45.344
Uh, what is this?

03:12:48.390 --> 03:12:49.557
Opening night.

03:12:51.226 --> 03:12:53.936
Fifteen years ago.

03:12:54.104 --> 03:12:56.355
Uh, who's this?

03:12:58.066 --> 03:13:01.068
Patron saint of the place.

03:13:02.445 --> 03:13:04.697
And some actress.

03:13:05.490 --> 03:13:06.865
Do you know her?

03:13:08.868 --> 03:13:10.411
No.

03:14:03.548 --> 03:14:05.841
Hello, Deborah.

03:14:13.433 --> 03:14:16.101
Aren't you gonna say anything?

03:14:22.859 --> 03:14:26.195
What is someone
supposed to say after...

03:14:26.821 --> 03:14:29.865
...more than 30 years.

03:14:34.996 --> 03:14:40.959
Well, how about, "How you doing?
You're looking good."

03:14:42.962 --> 03:14:46.131
Or, "I was hoping I'd never
see you again."

03:14:48.551 --> 03:14:51.553
I never thought I would.

03:14:52.639 --> 03:14:54.973
There's a difference.

03:14:55.141 --> 03:14:58.811
Yeah. At least you recognize me,
that's something.

03:14:58.978 --> 03:15:01.980
Actresses have good memories.

03:15:11.741 --> 03:15:14.076
You want a drink?

03:15:18.289 --> 03:15:20.708
I'm having one.

03:15:31.136 --> 03:15:32.177
Margo?

03:15:33.930 --> 03:15:36.640
-Yes, miss?
That's all for now. You can go.

03:15:36.808 --> 03:15:39.017
All right, miss.

03:15:43.898 --> 03:15:46.775
She called you "miss."

03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:49.528
You never got married?

03:15:50.363 --> 03:15:51.989
No.

03:15:55.577 --> 03:15:57.119
You live alone?

03:16:05.253 --> 03:16:06.754
No.

03:16:13.595 --> 03:16:15.929
Where were you?

03:16:18.850 --> 03:16:21.268
I was out of town.

03:16:24.105 --> 03:16:26.899
Have you been back long?

03:16:27.859 --> 03:16:30.277
A couple of days.

03:16:30.445 --> 03:16:32.696
Are you staying?

03:16:44.334 --> 03:16:45.751
That depends.

03:16:48.671 --> 03:16:50.756
Why do you want to see me?

03:16:52.592 --> 03:16:54.927
Two reasons.

03:16:55.094 --> 03:16:58.347
First, I wanted to see
if you did the right thing...

03:16:58.515 --> 03:17:00.599
...turning me down
to become an actress.

03:17:04.771 --> 03:17:06.355
Well?

03:17:09.150 --> 03:17:11.401
You did. You're terrific.

03:17:27.168 --> 03:17:30.254
"Age cannot wither her."

03:17:30.463 --> 03:17:33.465
It's like the play
was written for you.

03:17:36.928 --> 03:17:39.388
What was the other reason?

03:17:39.597 --> 03:17:41.890
The other reason...

03:17:45.103 --> 03:17:49.439
...is to decide whether I should go
to a party tomorrow night.

03:17:56.155 --> 03:17:57.698
A party?

03:18:00.994 --> 03:18:03.495
Yeah, on Long Island.

03:18:04.998 --> 03:18:08.166
A Secretary Bailey.

03:18:12.005 --> 03:18:14.172
Do you know Secretary Bailey?

03:18:16.009 --> 03:18:17.217
No.

03:18:19.512 --> 03:18:21.972
But I was invited anyway.

03:18:30.315 --> 03:18:33.358
But if you don't know each other,
why were you invited?

03:18:33.526 --> 03:18:35.068
I don't know.

03:18:36.696 --> 03:18:38.739
I thought you might know why.

03:18:39.657 --> 03:18:41.158
Me?

03:18:41.367 --> 03:18:42.993
Why me?

03:18:48.416 --> 03:18:50.334
Because you know him.

03:18:51.794 --> 03:18:53.253
-Who is it?
David.

03:18:53.421 --> 03:18:56.089
-No, David.
Can I come in?

03:18:56.299 --> 03:18:59.134
No, no, no. Just wait outside,
David, I'll call you.

03:18:59.344 --> 03:19:01.720
Okay, I'll be right here.

03:19:04.515 --> 03:19:08.310
-What does Secretary Bailey want from me?
-You came here to ask me that?

03:19:08.519 --> 03:19:11.480
-Why did he send me an invitation?
-I don't know. I don't know.

03:19:11.689 --> 03:19:16.026
Why should--? Why should I know about
your invitations? I don't know anything. I--

03:19:16.235 --> 03:19:20.238
What do you want from me? Why did
you come here? I know nothing, nothing.

03:19:20.406 --> 03:19:23.075
Now you're a lousy actress.

03:19:25.912 --> 03:19:28.747
Who is Secretary Bailey?

03:19:37.507 --> 03:19:41.134
Secretary Bailey is a rich businessman.

03:19:46.849 --> 03:19:51.436
He came to the United States as a starving
immigrant and made a lot of money...

03:19:51.646 --> 03:19:55.607
...in San Francisco and Los Angeles,
where he's lived for 30 years.

03:19:55.775 --> 03:19:59.778
I know all that. It's all in the papers.
What else is there?

03:20:06.285 --> 03:20:09.287
He married a very wealthy woman.

03:20:10.581 --> 03:20:12.916
They had a child.

03:20:13.292 --> 03:20:16.336
She died when the child was born.

03:20:16.921 --> 03:20:21.466
A few years ago, he went into politics.
Moved here.

03:20:21.634 --> 03:20:26.263
That's all past history. I'm not talking
about that. I'm talking about now.

03:20:26.848 --> 03:20:29.474
Right now he's in trouble.

03:20:31.144 --> 03:20:34.521
Why can't you just tell me you've
been living with him all these years...

03:20:34.689 --> 03:20:36.648
...and that you're his lover?

03:20:45.491 --> 03:20:48.493
Age can wither me, Noodles.

03:20:52.206 --> 03:20:54.833
We're both getting old.

03:21:00.173 --> 03:21:03.467
All that we have left now
are our memories.

03:21:06.387 --> 03:21:12.350
If you go to that party on Saturday
night, you won't have those anymore.

03:21:13.644 --> 03:21:16.188
Tear up that invitation.

03:21:18.483 --> 03:21:21.193
There's an exit back this way.

03:21:22.111 --> 03:21:25.030
Noodles, go through it.

03:21:27.700 --> 03:21:29.576
Keep walking.

03:21:29.786 --> 03:21:32.037
Don't turn around.

03:21:33.164 --> 03:21:35.415
Please, Noodles.

03:21:35.583 --> 03:21:38.710
I'm begging you. Please.

03:21:45.176 --> 03:21:48.720
Are you afraid that I'll turn
into a pillar of salt?

03:21:52.183 --> 03:21:55.977
If you go out that door, yes.

03:22:54.203 --> 03:22:57.164
This is Secretary Bailey's son.

03:22:57.373 --> 03:23:00.876
His name's David, just like yours.

03:25:52.423 --> 03:25:54.257
Please go in.

03:26:08.647 --> 03:26:10.815
What are you waiting for?

03:26:14.653 --> 03:26:17.113
I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.

03:26:43.808 --> 03:26:45.892
Sit down, Noodles.

03:26:50.147 --> 03:26:51.940
Make yourself comfortable.

03:27:10.334 --> 03:27:13.044
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

03:27:13.212 --> 03:27:15.213
Well, I was curious.

03:27:18.175 --> 03:27:21.302
So many important people in one place.

03:27:21.512 --> 03:27:25.390
Yes. Well, the rats usually
desert a sinking ship.

03:27:25.850 --> 03:27:29.769
But in my case, they appear to be
flocking onboard.

03:27:41.407 --> 03:27:45.243
Yeah, well, I read about
your troubles in the newspapers.

03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:51.291
But a man in your position, with all
your power and all your privileges...

03:27:51.500 --> 03:27:55.753
...has to assume a certain amount
of responsibility...

03:27:56.422 --> 03:27:58.882
...a certain amount of risk.

03:28:06.348 --> 03:28:09.100
Why'd you ask me
to come here, Mr. Bailey?

03:28:12.438 --> 03:28:16.941
That invitation doesn't mean
a goddamn thing, and you know it.

03:28:17.318 --> 03:28:20.862
All that counts is what
was in that suitcase.

03:28:22.531 --> 03:28:25.241
The money and the contract.

03:28:28.078 --> 03:28:31.289
It didn't say who the contract
was on, though.

03:28:32.625 --> 03:28:35.043
Haven't you figured that out yet?

03:28:36.754 --> 03:28:38.296
You, Mr. Bailey?

03:28:52.102 --> 03:28:55.813
I haven't had a gun in my hand
for many, many years.

03:28:57.441 --> 03:29:02.987
My eyes aren't too good,
even with my glasses. My hands shake.

03:29:05.866 --> 03:29:09.869
-And I wouldn't wanna miss, Mr. Bailey.
-Cut the bullshit, Noodles.

03:29:11.413 --> 03:29:14.165
I'm already a dead man.

03:29:15.084 --> 03:29:19.504
At least give me the chance
to settle the debt that I owe to you.

03:29:20.172 --> 03:29:23.675
I'll never make it before
the investigating committee.

03:29:23.842 --> 03:29:27.804
They're scared to death
I'll implicate the whole bunch of them.

03:29:28.180 --> 03:29:30.390
They gotta get rid of me.

03:29:33.060 --> 03:29:36.020
Today is as good a day as any.

03:29:38.190 --> 03:29:40.567
You do it, Noodles.

03:29:41.527 --> 03:29:44.904
You're the only person
I can accept it from.

03:29:51.787 --> 03:29:54.372
You see, I found out where you were.

03:29:54.540 --> 03:29:57.625
I brought you back here for this.

03:29:58.961 --> 03:30:02.171
To even the score between you and me.

03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:07.010
You can get out through there.

03:30:14.268 --> 03:30:18.813
It leads right down to the street.
Nobody will see you.

03:30:25.571 --> 03:30:29.949
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr. Bailey. You don't owe me a thing.

03:30:37.916 --> 03:30:44.047
Your eyes were too full of tears to see
it wasn't me burned up on that street.

03:30:44.882 --> 03:30:46.758
It was somebody else.

03:30:48.344 --> 03:30:53.264
You were too shocked to realize
that the cops were in on it too.

03:30:53.891 --> 03:30:57.101
That was a syndicate
operation, Noodles.

03:31:07.404 --> 03:31:09.405
You're crazy.

03:31:11.867 --> 03:31:16.120
You said that to me once before,
a long time ago.

03:31:16.413 --> 03:31:19.874
But my mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment.

03:31:20.626 --> 03:31:24.128
I took away your whole life from you.

03:31:24.338 --> 03:31:27.173
I've been living in your place.

03:31:28.384 --> 03:31:31.010
I took everything.

03:31:32.429 --> 03:31:34.597
I took your money.

03:31:35.224 --> 03:31:37.433
I took your girl.

03:31:38.143 --> 03:31:42.939
All I left for you was 35 years of grief
over having killed me.

03:31:44.525 --> 03:31:45.566
Now, why don't you shoot?

03:33:21.205 --> 03:33:24.123
It's true,
I have killed people, Mr. Bailey.

03:33:24.333 --> 03:33:29.086
Sometimes to defend myself,
sometimes for money.

03:33:29.379 --> 03:33:31.923
And many people used to come to us.

03:33:32.132 --> 03:33:35.051
Business partners, rivals...

03:33:35.427 --> 03:33:37.595
...lovers.

03:33:37.971 --> 03:33:42.099
Some of the jobs we took
and some we didn't.

03:33:55.489 --> 03:33:58.449
Yours is one we would never touch,
Mr. Bailey.

03:33:59.326 --> 03:34:02.286
Is this your way of getting revenge?

03:34:06.250 --> 03:34:07.834
No.

03:34:11.171 --> 03:34:14.298
It's just the way I see things.

03:35:16.987 --> 03:35:19.780
It's 10:25...

03:35:21.074 --> 03:35:24.243
...and I've got nothing left to lose.

03:35:26.371 --> 03:35:30.333
When you've been betrayed by a friend,
you hit back.

03:35:35.380 --> 03:35:37.214
Do it.

03:35:59.363 --> 03:36:01.989
You see, Mr. Secretary...

03:36:03.992 --> 03:36:06.077
...I have a story also.

03:36:07.037 --> 03:36:09.580
A little simpler than yours.

03:36:10.707 --> 03:36:15.419
Many years ago I had a friend,
a dear friend.

03:36:17.047 --> 03:36:20.299
I turned him in to save his life...

03:36:20.509 --> 03:36:22.802
...but he was killed.

03:36:24.096 --> 03:36:26.931
But he wanted it that way.

03:36:27.975 --> 03:36:30.184
It was a great friendship.

03:36:33.271 --> 03:36:37.316
It went bad for him
and it went bad for me too.

03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:44.448
Good night, Mr. Bailey.

03:36:53.625 --> 03:36:57.336
I hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing.

03:36:59.256 --> 03:37:03.300
It'd be a shame to see
a lifetime of work go to waste.

03:40:28.882 --> 03:40:33.552
God bless America

03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:37.973
Land that I love

03:40:38.141 --> 03:40:42.811
Stand beside her
And guide her

03:40:43.104 --> 03:40:46.315
Through the night
With a light from above

03:40:48.068 --> 03:40:52.821
From the mountains
To the prairies

03:40:52.989 --> 03:40:57.368
To the oceans white with foam

03:40:58.411 --> 03:41:02.581
God bless America

03:41:02.749 --> 03:41:06.919
My home sweet home

03:41:08.338 --> 03:41:13.092
God bless America

03:41:13.260 --> 03:41:17.304
Land that I love

03:41:17.472 --> 03:41:22.351
Stand beside her
And guide her

03:41:23.305 --> 03:41:29.640
