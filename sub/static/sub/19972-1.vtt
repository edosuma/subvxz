00:34.902 --> 00:38.736
I gotta cut loose, footloose

00:38.806 --> 00:41.673
Kick off your Sunday shoes

00:41.742 --> 00:44.609
Please, Louise

00:44.679 --> 00:47.443
Pull me off of my knees

00:47.515 --> 00:50.040
Jack, get back

00:50.117 --> 00:52.984
C'mon before we crack

00:53.054 --> 00:55.750
Lose your blues

00:55.823 --> 00:58.451
Everybody cut footloose

01:03.197 --> 01:06.166
You're playin'so cool

01:06.234 --> 01:08.759
Obeying every rule

01:08.836 --> 01:11.669
Dig way down in your heart

01:11.739 --> 01:14.207
You're burning, yearning for some

01:14.275 --> 01:17.335
Somebody to tell you

01:17.411 --> 01:20.505
That life ain't passing you by

01:22.617 --> 01:25.814
I'm trying to tell you

01:25.887 --> 01:30.824
It will if you don't even try

01:32.159 --> 01:36.721
You can fly if you'd only cut loose
Footloose

01:36.797 --> 01:39.459
Kick off your Sunday shoes

01:39.533 --> 01:42.331
Oowhee, Marie

01:42.403 --> 01:45.236
Shake it, shake it for me

01:45.306 --> 01:47.968
Whoa, Milo

01:48.042 --> 01:50.875
C'mon, c'mon let go

01:50.945 --> 01:53.675
Lose your blues

01:53.748 --> 01:55.682
Everybody cut footloose

02:06.694 --> 02:09.822
You got to turn it around

02:09.896 --> 02:11.922
And put your feet on the ground

02:11.999 --> 02:15.765
Now take ahold of your soul

02:25.079 --> 02:29.038
I'm turning it loose
Footloose

02:37.777 --> 02:40.644
And he is testing us.

02:40.713 --> 02:45.582
Every, every day,
our Lord is testing us.

02:45.652 --> 02:47.643
If he wasn't testing us...

02:47.720 --> 02:49.881
how would you account...

02:49.956 --> 02:52.823
for the sorry state
of our society...

02:52.892 --> 02:55.793
for the crimes...

02:55.862 --> 02:59.229
that plague the big cities
of this country...

02:59.299 --> 03:04.066
when he could sweep this pestilence
from the face of the earth...

03:04.137 --> 03:07.038
with one mighty gesture of his hand?

03:08.975 --> 03:11.535
If our Lord wasn't testing us,
how would you account...

03:11.611 --> 03:13.545
for the proliferation these days...

03:13.613 --> 03:17.640
of this obscene
rock and roll music...

03:17.717 --> 03:22.017
with its gospel of easy sexuality...

03:22.088 --> 03:24.056
and relaxed morality?

03:25.892 --> 03:28.656
If our Lord wasn't testing us,
why, he could take all...

03:28.728 --> 03:32.858
these pornographic books
and albums...

03:32.932 --> 03:37.028
and turn them into one big
fiery cinder like that!

03:37.103 --> 03:41.836
But how would that make us
stronger for him?

03:45.745 --> 03:50.273
One of these days,
my Lord is going to come to me...

03:50.350 --> 03:52.750
and ask me for an explanation...

03:52.819 --> 03:56.118
for the lives of each
and every one of you.

03:57.724 --> 04:00.522
What am I going to tell him
on that day?

04:01.261 --> 04:05.755
That I was busy?
That I was tired?

04:06.699 --> 04:08.633
That I was bored?

04:08.701 --> 04:11.499
No! I can never let up!

04:12.572 --> 04:14.506
I welcome his test.

04:14.574 --> 04:16.565
I welcome this challenge
from my Lord...

04:16.642 --> 04:20.409
so that one day I can deliver
all of you unto his hands.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.880
And when that day dawns...

04:22.949 --> 04:25.816
I don't want to have
to do any explaining!

04:25.885 --> 04:29.616
I don't want to be missing...

04:29.689 --> 04:31.714
from your lives!

04:31.791 --> 04:34.419
Praise the Lord in singing...

04:34.494 --> 04:37.725
hymn number 39 7...

04:37.797 --> 04:41.597
''What a Friend We Have in Jesus.''

04:44.904 --> 04:47.338
What a friend

04:47.407 --> 04:52.276
We have in Jesus

04:52.345 --> 04:58.250
All our sins and grief to bear

04:58.318 --> 05:01.583
I will. You have
a good week now. Bye.

05:01.654 --> 05:05.715
Mrs. MacCormack, your sister
has us so excited about you coming.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.158
- Thank you.
- Did you meet my wife, Vi?

05:08.227 --> 05:11.458
- No. How do you do?
- How nice to meet you.

05:11.531 --> 05:13.999
- This is my son, Ren.
- Hello, Ren.

05:14.067 --> 05:16.865
- Would you excuse me?
- Daddy?

05:16.936 --> 05:20.030
Ariel, will you come
and meet the MacCormacks?

05:20.106 --> 05:22.040
The stunning new gentleman.

05:22.108 --> 05:25.544
This is Mrs. MacCormack
and her son. Is it Ren?

05:28.848 --> 05:32.113
Ren's going to be new
at the high school tomorrow.

05:33.553 --> 05:38.388
Me, Edna, Wendy Jo and Rusty are
going for a soda at the Hi-Spot.

05:38.458 --> 05:41.484
Ariel, remember
you have school tomorrow.

05:41.561 --> 05:44.155
I'll be home for supper.

05:44.230 --> 05:46.562
God, is he excellent!

05:46.632 --> 05:48.725
What, the new kid?
He's all right.

05:48.801 --> 05:51.326
Are you blind?
He is gorgeous!

05:51.404 --> 05:54.373
- Have you seen the new high school?
- No, I haven't.

05:54.440 --> 05:58.570
I almost forgot.
Cindy Addis had her baby.

05:58.644 --> 06:00.874
What was it? Who told you?

06:00.947 --> 06:04.405
- My mother spoke to her mother.
- Is she coming back for graduation?

06:04.484 --> 06:06.418
I don't feel sorry for her.

06:06.486 --> 06:09.216
You can't buy a diaphragm
through the mail. I'm serious.

06:10.323 --> 06:12.348
Did she decide who the father was?

06:12.425 --> 06:14.052
It was Duane Capps.

06:14.127 --> 06:18.393
Wait! I've been going with
Duane Capps. He'd never have time.

06:18.464 --> 06:20.159
How long does it take?

06:20.233 --> 06:22.724
Ladies and gentlemen,
moving up behind us...

06:22.802 --> 06:26.329
you'll notice the
incredible barf-mobile.

06:29.342 --> 06:31.435
Come on!

06:33.446 --> 06:35.505
Hi, girls. Goin' my way?

06:35.581 --> 06:37.845
You lonely tonight?

06:37.917 --> 06:41.785
- You want a race, you got a race!
- What, that piece of junk?

06:41.854 --> 06:45.051
- Step on it!
- I am steppin' on it!

06:54.300 --> 06:57.360
Come on! No guts, huh?

06:59.005 --> 07:02.202
- In back of us, buddy!
- Take this, Rusty.

07:02.275 --> 07:05.210
- Come on!
- You chicken!

07:05.278 --> 07:10.739
- Come on, take you all on, girl.
- Come on! Come on, Chuck!

07:10.817 --> 07:13.752
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

07:13.820 --> 07:17.449
- Edna, slow down, please.
- Throw it, honey.

07:18.558 --> 07:20.287
Stop it!

07:20.359 --> 07:21.792
I'll get closer.

07:21.861 --> 07:24.762
You can do it. Keep coming!

07:29.635 --> 07:33.731
Ariel, will you stop it? Now!

07:33.806 --> 07:37.264
Stop showing off! It's not funny!
You're gonna kill yourself!

07:41.547 --> 07:43.606
Look, please be careful!

07:43.683 --> 07:46.516
He's testing us! He's testing us!

07:50.723 --> 07:53.123
Ariel, there's a truck!

07:59.599 --> 08:00.861
Get in the car!

08:03.736 --> 08:05.966
Shit! Get in the truck!

08:06.038 --> 08:07.630
Get in the car!

08:11.677 --> 08:12.974
Be careful!

08:21.954 --> 08:23.854
Come on! Get in!

08:27.360 --> 08:28.657
Get in!

08:37.035 --> 08:40.198
Jesus, we should never
have let her done that.

08:49.615 --> 08:52.846
- Have you met any of your teachers?
- No, I haven't had a chance.

08:52.919 --> 08:55.217
They've only been here
eight hours.

08:55.288 --> 08:58.883
I took care of that last week.
Registered him and everything.

08:58.958 --> 09:01.586
I made you some of those
Toll House squares I promised.

09:01.661 --> 09:04.494
Lulu, you taste one of these,
you'll burn your recipe.

09:04.564 --> 09:06.498
Reverend, we have a little problem.

09:06.566 --> 09:10.024
I heard the English teacher
is planning to teach that book.

09:10.102 --> 09:13.037
Slaughterhouse Five.
Isn't that an awful name?

09:13.105 --> 09:15.573
That's a great book.

09:20.413 --> 09:22.472
Slaughterhouse Five.

09:22.548 --> 09:24.948
It's, it's a classic.

09:26.085 --> 09:28.212
Do you read much?

09:28.287 --> 09:32.018
- In another town it's a classic.
- In any town.

09:32.091 --> 09:34.252
Tom Sawyer is a classic.

09:42.668 --> 09:46.297
- That's fine.
- Ethel, have some more ham.

09:46.372 --> 09:49.034
You sure Ren
doesn't want something?

09:49.108 --> 09:51.133
We're both a little tired
from the move.

09:51.210 --> 09:53.303
I'm gonna take Ren a potato.

09:53.379 --> 09:57.748
Amy, come back and sit down.
I'm sure your cousin's fine.

09:57.817 --> 10:01.253
It's a shock to the system,
moving out here from the big city.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.551
- What if he's starving?
- Amy, you are so lame.

10:04.624 --> 10:07.149
Sarah! Amy, eat!

10:07.226 --> 10:10.059
I can't sit still!
I'm so excited you're both here!

10:10.129 --> 10:12.324
You sure you're not too tired?

10:12.398 --> 10:14.332
No. Ren did most of the driving.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.927
If you ask me,
Ren is a total fox.

10:18.938 --> 10:20.872
Where did you hear that?

10:20.940 --> 10:26.003
See how television and those
kinds of books influence children?

10:36.288 --> 10:38.722
What the hell's the problem?

10:38.791 --> 10:41.851
- Chuck Cranston, are you crazy?
- You're sick!

10:41.927 --> 10:46.023
- Ariel, here's your sweater.
- Ariel, I could kill you!

10:46.098 --> 10:47.861
You almost did.

10:47.933 --> 10:49.901
That's what you get
for sniffing spray starch.

10:49.969 --> 10:52.904
After he graduated,
they drained his brain.

10:52.972 --> 10:55.805
- Edna, you gettin' fries?
- You can't have any.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.706
Wendy Jo!

10:57.777 --> 10:59.005
Yes?

10:59.078 --> 11:00.705
Bring me Edna's fries.

11:00.780 --> 11:02.975
Oh, sure!

11:05.051 --> 11:06.985
Where are you going?

11:08.154 --> 11:10.987
- What are you doing?
- Smuggled tapes.

11:11.057 --> 11:13.048
You be careful with that.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.992
Your daddy hears you playin' it,
he'll bust your butt.

11:46.992 --> 11:50.689
He put his hands all over!

13:08.974 --> 13:12.068
Your mother didn't think
you had any money with you.

13:32.298 --> 13:33.822
Yeah, Mom?

13:33.899 --> 13:35.833
You about ready to go?

13:35.901 --> 13:37.835
You gonna wear that tie?

13:37.903 --> 13:39.530
Yeah.

13:39.605 --> 13:42.631
I think you might want
to dress down for now.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.733
Why? I like the tie.

13:44.810 --> 13:48.644
September, when you go to college,
you can dress like David Bowie.

13:48.714 --> 13:50.648
Come on, let's go.

14:40.902 --> 14:42.927
Why don't you comb your hair?

14:43.004 --> 14:44.938
Shit, mister, where are you goin'?

14:45.006 --> 14:47.634
- You're supposed to look.
- Sorry.

14:47.709 --> 14:51.839
Where'd you learn how to drive?
Stay on the right side.

14:51.913 --> 14:56.043
I like that hat. They sell
men's clothes where you got that?

14:57.285 --> 14:59.219
Willard, come on.

15:00.088 --> 15:03.148
- What's your name?
- Ren.

15:03.224 --> 15:06.193
My name's Willard. Hewitt.

15:06.261 --> 15:08.320
- Glad to meet ya.
- How ya doin'?

15:08.396 --> 15:11.263
- All right. I'll see you around.
- All right.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.325
I swear, one of these days--

15:18.273 --> 15:20.503
That tie is fabulous!

15:20.575 --> 15:23.874
I mean it. It's fabulous. Don't let
anyone tell you any different.

15:30.085 --> 15:31.916
Right?

15:31.987 --> 15:33.750
Very good.

15:34.789 --> 15:37.053
Girl, you are on!

15:42.163 --> 15:47.157
Chicago, wow, man.
Must be wild, like the Naked City.

15:47.235 --> 15:48.896
Ah, fish.

15:48.970 --> 15:52.167
I'll tell ya, you're gonna bounce
off the goddamn walls here.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.174
What do you do there?

15:54.242 --> 15:57.473
Oh, I don't know. Same thing
you do here. What do you do here?

15:57.545 --> 15:59.479
- Lot of this.
- Yeah, that too.

16:00.982 --> 16:05.214
I'll tell you, there was this place
called the Blue Heaven.

16:05.286 --> 16:09.245
It was great. Had to steal IDs
to get in, but it was incredible.

16:09.324 --> 16:13.055
It was like a huge
underground circus, you know.

16:13.128 --> 16:17.030
Hot pink neon climbin' up the walls.
And astro music.

16:17.098 --> 16:20.499
And millions of girls,
like from the university mostly.

16:21.436 --> 16:24.564
If we could get one to dance,
just one, then that was it.

16:24.639 --> 16:26.937
We'd get out on the floor
and we'd really start to smoke.

16:27.008 --> 16:29.841
We'd start cuttin' in,
and these girls would stop.

16:29.911 --> 16:33.278
- And they'd look.
- They'd look how?

16:33.348 --> 16:36.647
You know, they'd start
to warm up a little. Right?

16:36.718 --> 16:39.209
Pretty soon,
they'd start buying us beers.

16:39.287 --> 16:41.517
- They're buying you guys beers?
- Oh, yeah.

16:41.589 --> 16:43.022
Ah, shit.

16:43.091 --> 16:45.355
Wait. There was this one.

16:47.328 --> 16:50.593
This was the best.
Ginger.

16:50.665 --> 16:53.361
Listen. We started dancing, right?

16:53.435 --> 16:56.666
Slow dancing,
like we're stuck to each other.

16:56.738 --> 17:00.037
Eventually it's obvious to me that
she wants to do more than dance.

17:00.108 --> 17:03.009
Right? So we left the place.

17:03.078 --> 17:07.310
On the way to the car, she's
already got her tongue in my ear.

17:07.382 --> 17:09.316
We get to the car.

17:09.384 --> 17:12.147
She says we can't go to her place
'cause of her roommate, right?

17:12.220 --> 17:14.518
But she says,
''Hey, that's no problem.''

17:14.589 --> 17:19.788
She's got seats in the car
that recline back. All the way back.

17:19.861 --> 17:22.796
- If you know what I'm saying.
- All the way?

17:22.864 --> 17:25.298
Would I shit you? Right?

17:25.366 --> 17:28.392
She rips my shirt open.
She's clawing my chest.

17:28.470 --> 17:31.166
She's biting my neck, and I'm trying
to get over the stick shift...

17:31.239 --> 17:33.332
'cause we're goin'
like a freight train now.

17:33.408 --> 17:36.502
All of a sudden, she starts
screaming at the top of her lungs...

17:36.578 --> 17:41.379
''Oh, God! Oh, God!
Don't stop! Make Ginger pop!''

17:41.449 --> 17:43.713
Oh, shit, really?

17:51.359 --> 17:53.691
But we did dance.

17:53.762 --> 17:55.696
We danced our asses off.

17:55.764 --> 17:59.291
Willard, how could you let
our new student eat this food?

17:59.367 --> 18:03.804
- Don't eat this.
- We have delicious homemade food.

18:03.872 --> 18:07.831
- Come on over.
- It's so good. Come on, Willard.

18:07.909 --> 18:09.672
Oh, chicken!

18:09.744 --> 18:14.204
Come on, come on. Good boy.
Bring your friend.

18:14.282 --> 18:16.944
- You won't get any of that here.
- What's that?

18:17.018 --> 18:19.145
- Dancing. There's no dancing.
- That's right.

18:19.220 --> 18:21.882
- Why?
- It's illegal.

18:21.956 --> 18:23.423
Jump back!

18:23.491 --> 18:24.617
It's true.

18:24.692 --> 18:27.957
- Has been for five or six years.
- Why?

18:28.029 --> 18:30.361
Go ahead, tell him.

18:30.431 --> 18:33.127
It started when kids
got killed in a car wreck.

18:33.201 --> 18:38.138
Whole town went bananas, blaming
it on the music, liquor and dancing.

18:38.206 --> 18:41.198
Now they're just convinced
it's all a sin.

18:41.276 --> 18:42.903
Who's convinced?

18:42.977 --> 18:45.275
Whole damn town.

18:51.452 --> 18:55.252
You really can't dance here, man?
I can't believe that.

18:55.323 --> 18:58.918
It's true. This isn't the only
place either. You'd be surprised.

18:58.993 --> 19:01.154
Places upstate you can't dance.

19:01.229 --> 19:04.995
Places in Kansas and Arkansas.
All over the place.

19:05.066 --> 19:07.660
My cousin lives in Montana, and ya
can't dance where she lives either.

19:07.735 --> 19:10.226
Yeah? She ever get busted
for bopping?

19:10.305 --> 19:12.239
I don't know.
I never asked her.

19:14.209 --> 19:16.143
You rich?

19:16.211 --> 19:18.202
No. Why?

19:18.279 --> 19:20.645
'Cause I don't think
I ever bought a tape before.

19:20.715 --> 19:24.344
Get serious!
This place is too weird.

19:24.419 --> 19:26.353
Don't you ever listen
to the radio?

19:26.421 --> 19:28.855
No. We got one radio at home,
but it's never on.

19:28.923 --> 19:30.857
- You like Men at Work?
- Which men?

19:30.925 --> 19:32.984
- Men at Work.
- Where do they work?

19:33.061 --> 19:35.894
- They're a music group.
- What do they call themselves?

19:35.964 --> 19:39.422
- Oh, no. What about the Police?
- What about 'em?

19:39.500 --> 19:41.593
- Have you heard them?
- No, but I seen 'em.

19:41.669 --> 19:44.194
- In concert?
- No, behind you.

19:44.272 --> 19:46.638
What? Oh, shit!

19:55.550 --> 19:58.883
- Step out of the car.
- Could you tell me the problem?

19:58.953 --> 20:01.945
Just step out of the car, please.

20:02.023 --> 20:05.186
-Jim, these plates are Illinois.
- So?

20:05.260 --> 20:07.728
You got a license?

20:07.795 --> 20:09.228
Catch.

20:09.297 --> 20:12.528
Hey, I just bought that.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.592
- Playing it kinda loud.
- There a law against loud music?

20:15.670 --> 20:20.073
Watch that attitude, boy! This way
I don't have to take you in.

20:20.141 --> 20:23.167
Twenty-five dollars. They wouldn't
even let me off with a warning.

20:23.244 --> 20:26.236
You can't talk to our police
the way you talk to big city police.

20:26.314 --> 20:28.612
- But I wasn't doing anything.
- Yeah, sure.

20:28.683 --> 20:30.173
Sarah, hush.

20:30.251 --> 20:32.947
There was this bunch of kids
snuck over the state line...

20:33.021 --> 20:34.989
to see some rock and roll group...

20:35.056 --> 20:38.719
and they were stopped on their way
back into town by the police.

20:38.793 --> 20:41.091
They were on church and
school probation for weeks!

20:41.162 --> 20:45.030
You better watch your step
around here, young man.

21:06.554 --> 21:07.987
Daddy?

21:11.592 --> 21:14.857
I'm sorry about the other night
at the drive-in, about the music.

21:16.030 --> 21:17.964
I was surprised.

21:18.032 --> 21:19.727
Yeah.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.448
I don't know what came over me.

21:34.515 --> 21:39.248
I can't always be with you.
I can't always look out for you.

21:49.163 --> 21:50.755
What's the music?

21:50.832 --> 21:55.201
Oh, it's-- I think it's Haydn.
Chamber pieces.

21:57.305 --> 21:59.899
And that kind of music's okay?

21:59.974 --> 22:04.809
It's uplifting. It doesn't confuse
people's minds and bodies.

22:07.782 --> 22:09.215
I don't--

22:12.620 --> 22:13.746
What?

22:16.124 --> 22:17.648
I see.

22:23.297 --> 22:27.393
Tell your mother to go on to bed.
I still have a lot of work.

22:27.468 --> 22:28.901
I will.

22:34.042 --> 22:35.669
What is it?

22:40.882 --> 22:43.578
- Good night.
- Good night, hon.

22:52.093 --> 22:54.027
Grab my books.

22:54.095 --> 22:56.029
Let me in.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.460
How you doin'?

23:05.206 --> 23:07.800
You the new kid?

23:09.777 --> 23:13.372
I'm talking to you.
Where'd your tie go?

23:16.217 --> 23:19.050
I thought only pansies
wore neckties.

23:19.120 --> 23:24.524
Oh, yeah? See that? I thought
only assholes used the word pansy.

23:24.592 --> 23:27.254
- He got you on that one!
- Shut up!

23:27.328 --> 23:30.661
Son of a bitch
is gonna pay for that!

23:33.234 --> 23:36.203
Either you got jumbo coconut balls,
or you're really pretty stupid.

23:36.270 --> 23:40.036
-Who was that douche bag?
-He's a weasel, but watch your back.

23:43.444 --> 23:46.936
- Can you operate a palette jack?
- Uh-uh.

23:47.014 --> 23:49.448
- How 'bout a bag closer?
- Uh-uh.

23:49.517 --> 23:51.542
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

23:51.619 --> 23:53.553
You're not stupid, are you?

23:54.355 --> 23:56.289
You trying to piss me off?

23:57.592 --> 24:00.925
Boy, a lot of folks are gonna
give you problems right off...

24:00.995 --> 24:02.963
because you're an outsider.

24:03.030 --> 24:05.931
You're dangerous. They're always
gonna worry about ya.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.699
Screw 'em. And this is only one
little corner of the world.

24:13.808 --> 24:15.935
Start Thursday?

24:17.211 --> 24:18.644
Sounds okay.

24:42.003 --> 24:44.938
Oh, hi, Ariel.

24:45.006 --> 24:46.940
Chuck Cranston wants to see you.

24:47.008 --> 24:49.977
Meet him the back
of his daddy's field tomorrow...

24:50.044 --> 24:51.841
5:30.

24:51.913 --> 24:54.746
What happens tomorrow at 5:30?

24:55.883 --> 25:00.013
-You'll have to show up to find out.
-And if I don't?

25:00.087 --> 25:03.853
People will know you're scared.

25:05.526 --> 25:07.926
Anyway, Chuck will find you.

25:07.995 --> 25:10.327
You want that?

25:10.398 --> 25:11.865
You're backing up!

25:11.933 --> 25:13.491
Hey, yo!

25:14.669 --> 25:17.229
How come he sent you?

25:17.305 --> 25:19.296
I volunteered.

25:19.373 --> 25:21.637
MacCormack, where the hell are you?

25:22.710 --> 25:24.143
You know her?

25:26.781 --> 25:28.874
So she tells me...

25:28.950 --> 25:32.818
that I pissed Chuck off, right?

25:32.887 --> 25:36.288
So he wants to see me.
Then she walks away.

25:36.357 --> 25:39.690
He figured you were gonna chicken
and never-- Impressive.

25:42.430 --> 25:44.364
Kinda out of it.

25:45.433 --> 25:47.663
I had to go to work last year.

25:47.735 --> 25:49.669
You still move it.

25:49.737 --> 25:54.572
You better watch that. Ariel's gonna
tell her pop and you're gonna burn.

25:54.642 --> 25:58.703
What's her story?
Is she really tough or what?

25:58.779 --> 26:01.839
She's just trying to make people
forget she's a preacher's kid.

26:04.151 --> 26:06.210
- That why she hangs out with Chuck?
- Maybe.

26:06.287 --> 26:09.916
- People think she's a hell-raiser.
- Is she?

26:09.991 --> 26:12.016
I think she's been kissed a lot.

26:18.933 --> 26:21.595
You'd never guess
your daddy's a fire chief.

26:21.669 --> 26:25.537
You'd never guess your daddy's
a minister. Red Boots.

26:25.606 --> 26:28.632
My daddy hates me
wearing these boots.

26:28.709 --> 26:31.940
And you love that, don't you?

26:38.319 --> 26:40.879
What are you gonna do
when I go away to college?

26:40.955 --> 26:42.946
Why do you wanna do that, honey?

26:43.024 --> 26:46.858
Just 'cause. I'm cut out for more
than this small town.

26:48.029 --> 26:50.156
You're as small town
as they come.

27:02.943 --> 27:05.935
A chicken race with tractors?

27:07.548 --> 27:10.278
- How hard could it be?
-Just like a car. It's easy.

27:10.351 --> 27:13.787
Just like driving a sports car.
Nothing could be simpler.

27:13.854 --> 27:16.482
Oh, hell, Ren,
just remember to stay calm.

27:16.557 --> 27:19.822
Calm? I've never driven
a tractor before.

27:19.894 --> 27:24.991
It's easy. Look. This is your
clutch, your gas, your brake.

27:25.066 --> 27:27.660
You start off,
you just shift it into high.

27:27.735 --> 27:29.828
Don't worry about your one, two,
three, four.Just put it into third.

27:29.904 --> 27:33.067
Once you get going,
slam it into fourth.

27:33.140 --> 27:36.576
That's your emergency brake.
These operate your bucket.

27:36.644 --> 27:40.512
I'll bet he's scared shitless,
and he turns out in ten seconds.

27:43.884 --> 27:46.648
Chuck, you sure you're up to this?

27:46.721 --> 27:48.712
Whose side are you on
anyway, honey?

27:48.789 --> 27:50.723
You had a lot to smoke.

27:50.791 --> 27:52.850
Don't tell me
I had enough to smoke.

27:52.927 --> 27:55.896
I didn't say you had enough.
I said you had a lot to smoke.

27:55.963 --> 27:57.988
Don't tell me that either!

27:59.667 --> 28:03.125
Why don't you go tell dog-face
we're ready to go! Yeah!

28:13.180 --> 28:15.978
Just remember he's chicken shit.
Hang in there. You'll be great!

28:16.050 --> 28:19.042
-Just hope to God he pulls out.
- I don't wanna split his face open.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.283
- Cool it, Tarzan!
- Give him hell, Ren!

28:23.657 --> 28:26.558
How did I get myself into this?

28:26.627 --> 28:29.289
Hey, Woody, come here.

28:30.631 --> 28:35.000
Listen, has anybody
ever died doing this?

28:35.069 --> 28:37.230
Just once.

28:37.304 --> 28:39.499
Hey, Ren! Hey, sport!

28:39.573 --> 28:43.873
When this hat flies in the air,
you better have your butt in gear.

29:25.152 --> 29:27.780
- Come on, Ren!
- Go! Go!

29:39.813 --> 29:42.304
Let's see what you're made of!

29:46.286 --> 29:47.878
Come on, sucker!

29:51.325 --> 29:52.849
Chuck, move it!

30:01.001 --> 30:03.799
You wanna go up, huh?

30:03.870 --> 30:05.303
There you go.

30:09.643 --> 30:12.407
Oh, you wanna go down.

30:14.681 --> 30:16.581
Kick his ass!

30:25.258 --> 30:27.419
That's it!Jump, you chicken!

30:27.494 --> 30:29.052
Sit down!

30:38.839 --> 30:42.400
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?

30:42.476 --> 30:44.444
You stupid idiot!

30:44.511 --> 30:46.103
Get off!

30:46.179 --> 30:47.703
Turn out!

30:47.781 --> 30:49.749
Oh, shit!

31:17.310 --> 31:21.337
Help! He tried to kill me.

31:33.293 --> 31:35.761
Excuse me. Thank you.

31:38.532 --> 31:40.523
I don't believe this town.

31:42.536 --> 31:43.969
Hello.

31:45.205 --> 31:46.900
Tell me.

31:46.973 --> 31:49.373
He has team practice
every day until 4:00.

31:49.443 --> 31:53.504
Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays
he's at the Beamis Mill till 6:00.

31:53.580 --> 31:56.208
You already knew that.

31:56.283 --> 31:58.808
He hasn't dated
since he's been in town.

31:58.885 --> 32:03.720
And late Friday nights,
by the light of the full moon...

32:03.790 --> 32:08.124
he breaks into churchyards and bites
the heads off live chickens.

32:12.099 --> 32:14.624
Come on, what is it? Chuck?

32:14.701 --> 32:17.568
I never did think he had
all his dogs barking anyway.

32:17.637 --> 32:21.334
Besides, what is wrong about
getting a little psyched over Ren?

32:21.408 --> 32:23.467
He's cute.
He's from out of town.

32:23.543 --> 32:26.068
Don't tell me that doesn't curl
your toes. I know you too well.

32:27.114 --> 32:29.674
You want out of here so bad,
you probably memorize bus schedules.

32:29.749 --> 32:31.512
And you don't?

32:48.368 --> 32:50.461
Hey, asshole.

32:50.537 --> 32:52.505
Interested in some
really good shit?

32:52.572 --> 32:55.564
Rich, you sly little shit.
You just made a whole sentence.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.406
Don't get smart-ass!

32:58.478 --> 33:02.847
I've been watching you.
I know you're not stupid.

33:02.916 --> 33:06.113
And I got a friend here who can
help you out from time to time.

33:06.186 --> 33:10.145
No, thanks. I got my own sources.
I'm getting into hog tranquilizers--

33:10.223 --> 33:13.454
We'll just call this a sample,
and you know where you can get more.

33:13.527 --> 33:17.861
- Rich, I don't want your shit.
- Why don't I just take it?

33:17.931 --> 33:20.422
You're taking chances
being new in this school.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.695
I gotta show you something.
Wait! This is tea!

33:28.008 --> 33:32.775
Would I do that with a real joint?
You know what an ounce goes for?

33:34.014 --> 33:36.107
I'm gonna get you.

33:37.651 --> 33:39.084
You wait.

33:40.153 --> 33:42.644
The Reverend was right about you.

33:50.664 --> 33:56.227
A bunch of kids was raising hell
at Burlington Cranston's property.

33:56.303 --> 33:59.397
Tore up the fields,
turned over a tractor.

34:00.674 --> 34:03.336
Today someone suggested
to me there's been...

34:03.410 --> 34:06.470
some trouble at the high school,
I think it was drugs.

34:07.614 --> 34:12.516
You wouldn't know about that?
What did you say? I can't hear you.

34:12.585 --> 34:14.850
- He said, ''No.''
- Amy.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.481
I said, ''No, sir.''

34:17.556 --> 34:21.721
You know, whenever we used
to call your folks in Chicago...

34:21.795 --> 34:23.922
I don't think there was
any trouble, was there?

34:28.902 --> 34:30.870
I don't know what
to make of it.

34:30.937 --> 34:35.897
-People are pointing your direction.
-What did they say?

34:35.976 --> 34:40.504
What I've been telling you
about the trouble and drugs.

34:40.580 --> 34:44.641
You seem to be having trouble since
you moved here. And I figured--

34:44.717 --> 34:47.346
You figured where there's smoke,
there's fire, right?

34:47.420 --> 34:49.388
Usually works like that.

34:50.389 --> 34:54.656
Look, you know I would never try
to take the place of your father.

34:54.728 --> 34:57.663
Well, there's no chance of that.

35:05.605 --> 35:07.869
Uh-oh, he's taking the car.

38:06.152 --> 38:07.983
Big time!

38:10.523 --> 38:12.582
What are you doing here?

38:12.659 --> 38:14.251
Watching.

38:14.327 --> 38:16.727
I thought I was alone.

38:16.796 --> 38:20.789
Not in this town.
There's eyes everywhere.

38:26.239 --> 38:29.606
- How come you don't like me?
- What makes you think I don't?

38:29.676 --> 38:33.578
You never talk to me at school.
You never look at me.

38:35.548 --> 38:39.951
Maybe because if I did, your
boyfriend would remove my lungs.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.645
Chuck Cranston doesn't own me.

38:43.723 --> 38:46.556
He likes to act like he does,
but he doesn't.

38:49.996 --> 38:52.556
Do you wanna kiss me?

38:53.366 --> 38:55.391
Someday.

38:57.437 --> 38:59.735
What is this someday shit?

39:01.741 --> 39:04.073
I get the feeling
you've been kissed a lot.

39:04.143 --> 39:07.237
I'm afraid I'd suffer
by comparison.

39:13.086 --> 39:15.247
You don't think much
of me, do you?

39:17.357 --> 39:19.450
You think I'm small town?

39:21.895 --> 39:23.829
I think Bomont's a small town.

39:26.466 --> 39:28.161
I'm going away.

39:29.402 --> 39:31.734
I've already applied to colleges.

39:31.804 --> 39:35.467
I applied to colleges my father
doesn't know I applied to.

39:37.610 --> 39:41.102
He's gonna come after me,
but I'm gonna be gone.

39:55.328 --> 39:57.489
Wanna see something?

39:59.766 --> 40:01.358
Sure.

40:05.605 --> 40:08.335
We call it ''The Yearbook.''

40:08.408 --> 40:12.242
It started four or
five years ago, I guess.

40:12.312 --> 40:14.473
It's stuff we're not
supposed to read.

40:21.087 --> 40:23.055
This is all out of books?

40:23.122 --> 40:26.956
Most of it.
Some songs, magazines.

40:28.127 --> 40:30.687
Some poems that get made up.

40:34.701 --> 40:39.400
''I'll sing to you of silver swans,
of kingdoms and carillons.''

40:39.472 --> 40:43.499
''I'll sing of bodies intertwined
underneath an innocent sky.''

40:45.311 --> 40:47.279
You wrote that?

40:47.347 --> 40:49.747
It's not even one of my best.

40:49.816 --> 40:51.511
It's all right.

40:58.691 --> 41:01.626
Wait a minute.
You hear that?

41:01.694 --> 41:03.685
- What?
- The train. You hear it?

41:07.533 --> 41:10.730
Sometimes after football games
we come out here.

41:10.803 --> 41:14.432
Just a few of us.
And we stand here.

41:14.507 --> 41:18.204
Then when the train comes,
we make out like crazy.

41:19.412 --> 41:20.845
Oh, yeah?

41:23.149 --> 41:25.845
Most of the time
we just stand and scream.

41:25.918 --> 41:27.408
Scream?

41:27.487 --> 41:30.456
Yeah. I saw it in a movie.
Real loud from here.

41:42.702 --> 41:44.636
Don't screw around.

42:41.427 --> 42:42.860
Come on.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.565
Come on,
I'll take you home.

43:03.216 --> 43:07.152
- It's late.
- Yeah.

43:09.622 --> 43:13.456
It's hard to impose a curfew on the
young people in my congregation...

43:13.526 --> 43:17.121
that I can't even enforce
in my own home.

43:19.799 --> 43:25.066
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

43:25.138 --> 43:27.538
- Were you smoking something?
- No!

43:28.808 --> 43:31.072
I wasn't stealing,
gambling, dancing...

43:31.144 --> 43:33.704
or reading books
I'm not supposed to.

43:33.780 --> 43:36.510
I am late!

43:36.582 --> 43:38.641
Who were you with?

43:39.719 --> 43:41.084
Ren MacCormack.

43:41.154 --> 43:44.715
- I don't want you to see him.
- Why?

43:44.791 --> 43:46.691
I've heard he's a troublemaker.

43:46.759 --> 43:49.023
Just 'cause he hasn't lived
in this town for 20 years...

43:49.095 --> 43:51.029
doesn't make him a troublemaker!

43:51.097 --> 43:54.464
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.

43:54.534 --> 43:56.866
There ain't nothing
to do with me, Daddy.

43:56.936 --> 44:01.451
Like it or not, this is it.
It doesn't get much better.

44:16.967 --> 44:20.664
What the hell happened?
Why'd you get kicked off the team?

44:20.737 --> 44:22.671
Because somebody's got it in for me.

44:22.739 --> 44:26.505
Coach found out I brought Ariel
home late, so I'm a troublemaker.

44:26.576 --> 44:30.512
That's not why
I'm off the team. No, no.

44:30.580 --> 44:35.017
I'm off'cause they don't have funds
for one more gymnast, but thank you.

44:35.085 --> 44:39.044
I'm busting my balls trying to fit
in and every door slams in my face.

44:39.122 --> 44:42.216
Hey, MacCormack!
Sorry to hear you got caught.

44:42.292 --> 44:44.260
Don't fool around
with the preacher's daughter!

44:44.328 --> 44:46.558
How does anybody live in this town?

44:46.630 --> 44:49.326
You know what it is?
You got an attitude problem.

44:49.399 --> 44:53.699
-I got an attitude problem?
-I'm not the only one who's noticed.

44:53.770 --> 44:57.831
We're not living in the goddamn
Middle Ages. We got TV, Family Feud.

44:57.908 --> 45:01.207
We're not stuck in
Leave It to Beaver land here.

45:01.278 --> 45:05.942
Well, I haven't noticed
a wet T-shirt contest in town yet.

45:06.984 --> 45:11.045
I haven't either,
but I'm waiting patiently.

45:11.121 --> 45:13.055
I tell you what I'd like to do.

45:13.123 --> 45:17.287
Glue a Playboy centerfold inside
each of Reverend Moore's hymnals.

45:17.361 --> 45:19.329
Yeah, you know what else
we could do?

45:19.396 --> 45:22.923
We could start one of your
nightclubs right in the church.

45:24.301 --> 45:27.634
That's it.
That's it, man.

45:28.705 --> 45:29.967
What's it?

45:30.040 --> 45:31.200
A dance.

45:32.242 --> 45:33.709
- What?
- A dance!

45:33.777 --> 45:37.144
We could have a dance!
You know, a dance?

45:37.214 --> 45:40.547
-You know what I mean! Dance! Dance!
-You're gonna get me angry!

45:40.617 --> 45:42.881
Gonna turn this town upside down!

45:42.953 --> 45:44.386
Stop it!

45:49.159 --> 45:51.992
I was down in Denver last year...

45:52.062 --> 45:55.327
for about a week
at a Bible convention.

45:55.399 --> 45:58.334
And the whole time I was there,
people would come up...

45:58.402 --> 46:03.169
and ask me, ''Reverend, how can
you live in such a small town...

46:03.240 --> 46:07.301
so far away from the hustle
and bustle of the 20th century?''

46:07.377 --> 46:10.642
I'd say to them,
''You'd never ask me that...

46:10.714 --> 46:13.444
if you could just once,
just for one minute...

46:13.517 --> 46:18.580
experience the feeling of family
that comes from knowing...

46:18.655 --> 46:21.590
that all of our lives
are tied up with each of us.

46:22.592 --> 46:24.617
That we feel all the same joys...

46:24.694 --> 46:29.631
the same sorrows,
and that we care.

46:30.834 --> 46:33.302
Each and every one of us cares
for the other.''

46:34.771 --> 46:36.102
I told them...

46:36.173 --> 46:39.540
''I just feel closer
to my Lord out there.

46:39.609 --> 46:43.306
And I feel closer...

46:43.380 --> 46:46.372
and safer with my people...

46:46.450 --> 46:49.044
and I think they feel closer to me.

46:50.387 --> 46:53.823
The Lord smiles on us out there.

46:55.125 --> 46:57.355
And that's why I'm staying.''

46:59.496 --> 47:01.361
Why don't you have some cake?

47:06.436 --> 47:09.735
Roger, the town council
has no intention of bowing...

47:09.806 --> 47:11.740
to wishes of a small group
of students.

47:11.808 --> 47:17.144
Eleanor and I are absolutely certain
that this boy is organizing a dance.

47:17.214 --> 47:19.978
- We're not gonna have any dance.
- We let some punk push us around...

47:20.050 --> 47:24.146
it won't be long before every
community standard is violated.

47:24.221 --> 47:26.189
- Boy, are they in a tizzy!
- Ariel, get in the car!

47:26.256 --> 47:29.157
- Got the whole council going!
- There's a meeting I won't miss.

47:29.226 --> 47:31.160
- Where are you taking us?
- Over the state line.

47:31.228 --> 47:33.196
I want you to see
what you've been missing.

47:33.263 --> 47:35.390
I know you're not gonna
let Willard fight, right?

47:35.465 --> 47:39.868
- I don't fight.
- Right, and I don't breathe.

48:02.492 --> 48:05.620
- Are you gonna dance?
- I drink better than I dance.

48:05.695 --> 48:07.458
Come on!

48:07.531 --> 48:10.261
I'll watch you guys, see if
you can show me something new.

48:10.333 --> 48:13.564
We didn't come all this way
just to sit it out.

48:13.637 --> 48:18.131
I'll be out there. Don't worry.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.

48:18.208 --> 48:21.905
Come on, don't be an asshole!
They're waiting to dance with us.

48:25.015 --> 48:27.245
I can't dance.

48:27.317 --> 48:28.978
You what?

48:29.052 --> 48:31.282
I can't dance.

48:32.355 --> 48:34.482
At all.

48:36.793 --> 48:39.091
All right. All right.

48:42.065 --> 48:44.761
- Buy him a beer.
- Take my jacket.

48:53.910 --> 48:58.313
- What's the matter?
- My feet have been hurting.

48:58.381 --> 49:00.474
They weren't hurting in the car.
I wanna dance.

49:00.550 --> 49:02.484
I wanna get a beer.

49:51.868 --> 49:53.995
Waitress, let me have another beer.

50:47.257 --> 50:50.192
I can't help myself!

52:07.237 --> 52:10.035
Hey, I came with that girl.

52:10.106 --> 52:12.700
Doesn't look like
you're leaving with her.

52:15.478 --> 52:18.174
Hey, I guess you didn't
hear me the first time.

52:18.248 --> 52:21.775
-No fights. You don't even know him.
-Why don't you flake off?

52:24.187 --> 52:25.984
No fights.

52:26.055 --> 52:29.786
When was the last time
you seen your dick, partner?

52:36.766 --> 52:39.360
Rusty, he was fighting
to save your honor.

52:39.436 --> 52:42.405
- It's too late.
- I don't fight.

52:42.472 --> 52:45.032
- Your dance gonna be like this one?
- Everything but the fight.

52:45.108 --> 52:46.541
Forget it.

52:46.609 --> 52:48.304
Ow! Come on!

52:49.979 --> 52:52.277
Up on the roof, oh, yeah.

52:52.348 --> 52:54.373
One hundred proof, oh, yea.

52:54.451 --> 52:56.612
Ain't that fine, oh, yeah.

52:56.686 --> 52:58.779
You cherry slime, oh, yeah.

53:01.257 --> 53:02.485
Oh, what?

53:02.559 --> 53:04.288
Oh, yea.

53:11.401 --> 53:13.767
I hate this bridge.
Gives me the creeps.

53:14.637 --> 53:16.070
How come?

53:17.941 --> 53:22.571
You've heard this one.
The infamous Crosby Bridge accident.

53:22.645 --> 53:25.546
- You've heard it.
- No.

53:25.615 --> 53:28.880
You're missing out!
'Bout five years ago...

53:28.952 --> 53:32.888
these kids were playing highway tag
and they were drunk.

53:32.956 --> 53:37.586
One car hits the other one, and
they both go over the bridge. Dead.

53:39.863 --> 53:42.263
That's when they started passing
laws against booze...

53:42.332 --> 53:44.732
against dancing and drinking.

53:44.801 --> 53:47.099
I don't know.

53:47.170 --> 53:50.469
My father had a field day.

53:50.540 --> 53:53.532
Your father? Why?

53:53.610 --> 53:55.908
My older brother
was one who got killed.

53:57.313 --> 53:59.247
You should've seen Bobby.

53:59.315 --> 54:01.875
He was like Warren Beatty,
only taller. Wasn't he?

54:04.153 --> 54:06.246
My father went off the deep end.

54:06.322 --> 54:09.485
He decided we all needed saving,
no matter what.

54:09.559 --> 54:13.586
He's gonna personally save this
pissant town and deliver it...

54:13.663 --> 54:16.632
to heaven with his daughter
sitting like a cherry on top.

54:41.024 --> 54:43.083
I called over to Rusty's last night.

54:49.299 --> 54:51.790
I don't understand why you feel
it necessary to lie to me.

54:53.036 --> 54:55.470
I don't know why you find
it necessary to check up on me.

54:55.538 --> 54:58.473
I'm concerned about
your well-being, that's all.

54:58.541 --> 55:01.476
How come when I'm home you're never
as interested in what I do or say...

55:01.544 --> 55:03.876
as you are when
I walk out that door?

55:03.947 --> 55:05.847
Wham! Suddenly
you wanna know everything!

55:05.915 --> 55:08.042
I don't like this outburst...

55:08.117 --> 55:11.553
any more than I like
not knowing where you were!

55:11.621 --> 55:13.782
Shaw, don't you think
we could wait on this?

55:13.856 --> 55:17.690
No, I don't. I'm sick and tired
of you coming in on her side!

55:17.760 --> 55:20.024
She'll have to start
answering for herself.

55:20.096 --> 55:23.532
I don't know why. You don't listen
to me any more than you do her.

55:49.559 --> 55:52.221
I've never hit anyone in my life.

55:56.466 --> 55:58.457
We're losing her, Vi.

56:00.036 --> 56:02.869
- Don't you see that?
- No.

56:02.939 --> 56:07.876
I see you chasing after her,
and I see her running from you.

56:07.944 --> 56:12.347
She's become so willful
and obstinate.

56:13.916 --> 56:16.077
She's like her father.

56:17.954 --> 56:22.118
The two of you
were so wonderful once.

56:22.191 --> 56:26.389
You had so much to talk about.

56:26.462 --> 56:28.692
I was almost jealous.

56:34.003 --> 56:36.267
It's not as if we don't talk.

56:37.340 --> 56:39.501
It's just that...

56:41.077 --> 56:44.012
sometimes people run out
of things to say.

56:57.527 --> 56:58.824
Shaw?

57:02.365 --> 57:05.198
It's 20 years now
I've been a minister's wife.

57:06.836 --> 57:11.967
And I've been quiet,
supportive, unobtrusive and...

57:13.843 --> 57:18.303
after 20 years I still think
you're a wonderful preacher.

57:19.749 --> 57:21.717
You can lift a congregation
up so high...

57:21.784 --> 57:23.843
they have to look down
to see heaven.

57:28.891 --> 57:32.418
But it's the one-to-one
where you need a little work.

57:43.740 --> 57:46.971
- We could really use your support.
- My mother wouldn't approve.

57:47.043 --> 57:49.375
But we're not talking
about a free-for-all.

57:49.445 --> 57:53.006
It won't be a drunken brawl.
It's just a dance.

57:53.082 --> 57:56.950
Just give it some thought.
Okay? Sleep on it.

57:57.019 --> 58:00.079
Just think about it.
Okay, thanks. See you later.

58:00.156 --> 58:02.522
Sounds great to me.

58:02.592 --> 58:05.026
How you doin'?
Need any help, just let me know.

58:05.094 --> 58:07.688
You got it.

58:07.764 --> 58:10.392
Chuck has heard something
that's upset him real good.

58:10.466 --> 58:14.698
I want you to tell me it ain't so,
Mr. Chicago Big Shot.

58:14.771 --> 58:19.140
He heard you're gonna try and throw
a dance at school. A senior dance.

58:19.208 --> 58:23.076
He figured only a dumb fag would try
that. Is that what you're trying?

58:23.146 --> 58:25.080
He sure the hell is!

58:26.883 --> 58:28.908
Excuse me, girls.
Come out, Ren.

58:28.985 --> 58:30.885
You guys stay there.

58:30.953 --> 58:33.148
Is he really gonna
get us a dance?

58:33.222 --> 58:35.156
Yep. Ain't ya?

58:36.125 --> 58:38.525
- It's about time, MacCormack.
- I'll be there.

58:38.594 --> 58:39.925
Thanks.

58:41.164 --> 58:43.952
Don't you have any better manners?
Didn't your mama teach you better?

58:44.086 --> 58:46.077
You treat animals like that?

58:46.155 --> 58:49.147
How's it feel?
Don't feel too good now, does it?

58:49.291 --> 58:52.419
- What are you talking about?
- You'll have to fight city hall.

58:52.494 --> 58:54.428
What do you mean
I gotta fight city hall?

58:54.496 --> 58:57.294
'Cause there's a town council.

58:59.868 --> 59:01.995
It's made up of seven people.

59:02.070 --> 59:06.029
Shaw Moore's one of'em.
Burlington Cranston is another.

59:06.108 --> 59:09.305
Personally, I don't like
that lousy son of a bitch.

59:09.378 --> 59:11.903
They meet every third Thursday
of the month.

59:11.980 --> 59:14.778
Something you want in this town,
you'll have to talk to them.

59:14.850 --> 59:17.546
You're gonna get really creamed.

59:17.619 --> 59:20.588
Geez. I'm not so good
with words.

59:20.656 --> 59:24.285
Keep thinking like that, man,
and you are gonna get creamed.

59:24.359 --> 59:27.453
Woody doesn't know
a dance from a dipstick.

59:28.797 --> 59:32.028
And you do? You do, huh?
Which way is your left?

59:32.100 --> 59:34.534
Huh? Willard,
which way is your left?

59:34.603 --> 59:37.231
He don't know his left foot
from his right foot.

59:37.306 --> 59:40.605
I'll tell you something. If I gotta
get up in front of that council...

59:40.676 --> 59:42.610
you gotta learn to dance.

01:03:00.742 --> 01:03:03.643
What is this, Roger?
I don't know this book.

01:03:03.712 --> 01:03:05.145
I hope you wouldn't.

01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:09.513
Reverend Moore, Mrs. Evans is
calling about that dance at school.

01:03:09.584 --> 01:03:12.348
Would you tell her I'll call her
back after Junior Bible?

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.945
What were you saying?

01:03:14.022 --> 01:03:16.957
This was found in one of
the athletic lockers at school.

01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:18.959
A book like this should be burned.

01:03:19.027 --> 01:03:22.087
We should go to the library
and remove this corruption.

01:03:22.164 --> 01:03:25.497
There's no sense blowing it up
into something that it isn't.

01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:27.228
Hello! Careful.

01:03:28.503 --> 01:03:30.630
Come on, Max.

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.367
I'll set up, Vi.

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.705
I think it's quite obvious
what it is.

01:03:34.776 --> 01:03:37.836
It's not quite so obvious
how I should handle it.

01:03:37.913 --> 01:03:41.007
Reverend, if you'll excuse
my saying so...

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:43.313
when we got rid of that young
English teacher at the school...

01:03:43.385 --> 01:03:46.411
we didn't get
any support from you.

01:03:46.488 --> 01:03:49.457
Because I didn't think we had
any grounds for his dismissal.

01:03:49.524 --> 01:03:52.550
Around here, it caused
a lot of folks some worry.

01:03:52.627 --> 01:03:55.027
A lot of folks worry
a little too much.

01:03:55.997 --> 01:03:58.227
Doesn't take much time
for corruption to take root.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.268
How long is that, Roger?

01:04:00.335 --> 01:04:03.202
About as long as
it takes compassion to die?

01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:08.166
- Do I get a cookie?
- No!

01:04:08.243 --> 01:04:12.509
- Did you drink all the milk?
- Yeah!

01:04:41.443 --> 01:04:43.775
- I wanted to talk to you.
- You don't have to tell me nothin'.

01:04:43.845 --> 01:04:45.779
I know why
you don't call me.

01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:48.911
I wanted to tell you myself.

01:04:48.984 --> 01:04:51.179
I know why you don't want
to see me anymore.

01:04:51.253 --> 01:04:53.346
I'm not stupid!

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:56.853
I'm not blind.

01:04:57.859 --> 01:05:00.191
It's MacCormack, ain't it?

01:05:00.262 --> 01:05:04.790
You're just dying to screw
MacCormack, aren't you? Aren't you?

01:05:04.866 --> 01:05:06.891
You're so stupid!

01:05:06.968 --> 01:05:08.458
Stupid?

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:11.472
Think I don't see you looking at him
like some bitch in heat?

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.474
You'll wrap those skinny legs
around anybody.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:14.600
Shut up!

01:05:16.311 --> 01:05:18.905
Is that what I get? Huh?

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.811
I treated you decent!

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.883
Shit.

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:38.326
Put that down!
Don't even think about that.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.766
-Jesus!
- You think about it!

01:05:49.978 --> 01:05:52.037
Stop it, Chuck!

01:06:08.096 --> 01:06:10.530
'Bout through with you anyway.

01:06:23.912 --> 01:06:27.279
I'm sorry you have
to see me like this.

01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:30.512
I'll be okay. I'll sneak in
at home. I'll be fine.

01:06:30.585 --> 01:06:33.520
- Do I look okay?
- You'll pull through.

01:06:38.793 --> 01:06:41.057
Thanks for coming for me.

01:06:42.931 --> 01:06:44.865
I don't understand.

01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:47.367
There's nothing to understand.

01:06:47.435 --> 01:06:50.131
It's for taking on my father.

01:06:50.205 --> 01:06:54.107
Wait a minute.
I got no beef with him.

01:06:54.175 --> 01:06:58.407
No, wait. This is my fight, it's
with the town, not with one guy.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.849
You don't get to turn my fight
into a ''screw you'' to your old man.

01:07:12.494 --> 01:07:13.927
Hey, look...

01:07:16.798 --> 01:07:18.561
maybe--

01:07:21.102 --> 01:07:24.629
Maybe you shouldn't try so hard
to forget your brother...

01:07:26.441 --> 01:07:29.171
or to try to make your father
forget him, you know?

01:07:33.448 --> 01:07:36.281
- It's not that easy.
- I know.

01:07:38.453 --> 01:07:40.421
Do I still get the box?

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.257
Gimme the box.

01:07:58.807 --> 01:08:00.240
Nice.

01:08:09.217 --> 01:08:11.151
Think you might ever kiss me?

01:08:57.165 --> 01:08:59.725
Harvey and Bernie
were here for a long time.

01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:03.203
They still talking
about that dance?

01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:04.703
Yeah.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:12.768
- What did you decide to do?
- It's not gonna happen.

01:09:14.849 --> 01:09:19.115
That's one more thing Ariel is not
going to forgive me for, but--

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:25.091
Can you step out of the way enough
to realize she's doing this for you?

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.593
Me?

01:09:28.263 --> 01:09:30.493
I don't see that.

01:09:30.564 --> 01:09:32.499
I just know that
when kids dance together...

01:09:32.567 --> 01:09:35.536
they become sexually irresponsible.

01:09:35.603 --> 01:09:37.662
I can't take the chance--

01:09:39.607 --> 01:09:41.541
What's so funny?

01:09:43.545 --> 01:09:47.242
You talk like that's the only thing
that gets them excited.

01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:51.880
Don't you remember when we used to
look at each other and get excited?

01:09:54.923 --> 01:09:56.857
It's just the same with them.

01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:00.486
You're not gonna put
their eyes out.

01:10:18.012 --> 01:10:20.810
None of this is gonna undo
one stupid accident.

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:25.219
I'm responsible for
the spiritual life of this community.

01:10:27.555 --> 01:10:30.991
Shaw, you can't be
a father to everybody.

01:10:31.059 --> 01:10:33.050
You can't do that.

01:10:36.297 --> 01:10:38.731
I thought that at least
you believed in me.

01:10:50.712 --> 01:10:52.646
I never stopped.

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:58.145
Be at the town council meeting
tomorrow night.

01:10:58.219 --> 01:10:59.652
Only fairies dance.

01:11:01.122 --> 01:11:03.056
I'll lay you flat, Ariel.

01:11:03.124 --> 01:11:06.753
Support Ren MacCormack at
the council meeting tomorrow night.

01:11:06.828 --> 01:11:08.853
You can make a difference!

01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:13.230
I'm calling to remind you
to come to the town council meeting.

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.806
Hi.

01:11:19.874 --> 01:11:21.899
- Still hurt?
- Naw.

01:11:21.976 --> 01:11:23.944
Good.

01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:25.980
- Nervous?
- No. Uh-uh.

01:11:26.948 --> 01:11:28.381
Look, I--

01:11:29.651 --> 01:11:31.448
Yeah.

01:11:31.519 --> 01:11:33.453
Yeah, I'm nervous.

01:11:33.521 --> 01:11:36.979
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to the council.

01:11:37.058 --> 01:11:39.686
There's only seven of them, right?

01:11:41.329 --> 01:11:44.264
- Who else is gonna be there?
- Everybody.

01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:48.192
Take a deep breath.
You ready?

01:11:53.074 --> 01:11:56.305
What is it? The Holy Bible?

01:12:02.717 --> 01:12:04.708
Ah, this is great.

01:12:06.854 --> 01:12:09.322
This is great! What--

01:12:10.892 --> 01:12:13.292
How'd you know where
to find all this?

01:12:13.361 --> 01:12:14.794
Are you kidding?

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.633
I wanna tell you something.

01:12:22.704 --> 01:12:24.137
Thanks.

01:12:34.415 --> 01:12:35.848
Come on.

01:12:42.557 --> 01:12:44.491
What the hell is that?

01:12:47.395 --> 01:12:49.761
- Oh, my God!
- Amy? What is it?

01:12:51.899 --> 01:12:54.094
''Burn in hell''?
This says, ''Burn in hell.''

01:12:56.537 --> 01:13:00.064
- Ren, what the hell is going on?
- Somebody's trying to make a point.

01:13:00.141 --> 01:13:01.699
Do you see now?

01:13:01.776 --> 01:13:04.768
You don't wave flags here
without people taking shots at them.

01:13:04.846 --> 01:13:06.871
This is not the first time.

01:13:06.948 --> 01:13:10.714
My business was off, but people
are taking business away from me.

01:13:10.785 --> 01:13:15.245
Your aunt's gotten ugly phone calls
and today your mother lost her job.

01:13:15.323 --> 01:13:16.756
Mom, is that true?

01:13:18.359 --> 01:13:20.384
Mr. Collins said
he heard things about you.

01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:22.520
He thought I ought to stay home
and be a proper mother.

01:13:22.597 --> 01:13:24.861
- What did you say?
- I told him to shove it.

01:13:24.932 --> 01:13:26.866
Damn it, Ethel, this is serious.

01:13:26.934 --> 01:13:28.799
- There's other jobs!
- Where?

01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:31.896
- Shouldn't you call the police?
- I don't know if it'll do any good.

01:13:31.973 --> 01:13:34.635
I'll get Jim Earlhaus over here.
Will you stop?

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:37.041
Now will you stop?

01:13:38.346 --> 01:13:40.439
I don't understand this town.

01:13:40.515 --> 01:13:43.075
It's like something's
choking everybody...

01:13:43.151 --> 01:13:45.278
only they don't know
they're choking.

01:13:45.353 --> 01:13:46.501
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?

01:13:46.501 --> 01:13:48.765
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?

01:13:50.505 --> 01:13:54.100
It's not just about a dance.
Not anymore.

01:13:54.176 --> 01:13:56.337
I know.
That's what I mean.

01:13:57.312 --> 01:13:59.906
I watch you, I see.

01:14:06.588 --> 01:14:10.285
- You're not gonna understand this.
- Try me.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.434
When Dad first threatened to leave,
I thought it was because of me.

01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:27.874
I thought it was something
that I wasn't doing right.

01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:33.040
And I figured there was something
I could do to make it like it was...

01:14:33.115 --> 01:14:35.640
and then he'd want to stay,
you know.

01:14:38.153 --> 01:14:41.645
But when he left
just like that...

01:14:41.723 --> 01:14:46.353
I realized that everything I'd done
hoping that he'd stay--

01:14:48.263 --> 01:14:52.962
everything I'd done,
it didn't mean shit.

01:14:53.835 --> 01:14:55.268
Didn't matter.

01:14:57.406 --> 01:15:00.341
And I felt like,
''What difference does it make?''

01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:04.144
But now--

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:09.077
Now I'm thinking...

01:15:09.151 --> 01:15:11.779
I could really do something,
you know.

01:15:13.422 --> 01:15:17.256
I could really do something
for me this time, you know...

01:15:19.327 --> 01:15:21.795
otherwise I'm just gonna disappear.

01:15:39.047 --> 01:15:43.313
All right, Virginia, that ends
the discussion on this issue.

01:15:43.385 --> 01:15:47.219
So the price of a dog license
will go from $3.50 to $4.50.

01:15:47.289 --> 01:15:50.349
A licensed pet is a happy one.

01:15:50.425 --> 01:15:53.121
That takes care of old business.
Burlington?

01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:57.392
Thank you, Virginia.
It was real good.

01:15:57.466 --> 01:16:02.199
Now we can consider
any new business.

01:16:03.839 --> 01:16:06.069
Excuse me.

01:16:06.141 --> 01:16:09.838
Before we begin, I want
to remind all you kids...

01:16:09.911 --> 01:16:13.403
we're conducting
an official meeting.

01:16:14.516 --> 01:16:17.246
We're not gonna tolerate
any disturbances.

01:16:20.088 --> 01:16:22.420
The floor is now open
for any new business.

01:16:22.491 --> 01:16:26.825
My name is Ren MacCormack and
I would like to move on behalf...

01:16:26.895 --> 01:16:31.389
of most of the senior class of
Bomont High School that the law...

01:16:31.466 --> 01:16:34.663
against public dancing within the
town limits of Bomont be abolished.

01:16:41.343 --> 01:16:44.005
Mr. Chairman,
could I address myself to this?

01:16:44.079 --> 01:16:45.706
You bet.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:49.045
Even if this was not a law...

01:16:49.117 --> 01:16:51.551
which it is...

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:56.080
I'm afraid I would have difficulty
endorsing an enterprise...

01:16:56.158 --> 01:17:00.424
which is as fraught
with genuine peril...

01:17:00.495 --> 01:17:02.554
as I believe this one to be.

01:17:03.532 --> 01:17:09.368
Besides liquor and drugs, which
seem to accompany such an event...

01:17:09.437 --> 01:17:13.999
the thing that distresses me
even more, Ren...

01:17:14.075 --> 01:17:18.910
is the spiritual corruption
that can be involved.

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:23.508
These dances and this kind of music
can be destructive.

01:17:23.585 --> 01:17:26.782
And, Ren, I'm afraid
you're gonna find...

01:17:26.855 --> 01:17:30.120
that most of the people in
our community will agree with me.

01:17:30.192 --> 01:17:31.659
I do.

01:17:34.563 --> 01:17:37.930
- That's all I have to say.
- A vote is in order on the motion.

01:17:37.999 --> 01:17:41.435
- Will all those opposed--
- Excuse me, I--

01:17:41.503 --> 01:17:44.836
- I would like to say something.
- Please sit down.

01:17:44.906 --> 01:17:46.931
This is outrageous!

01:17:47.008 --> 01:17:49.442
- If you think that we're--
- Eleanor, sit down.

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:57.245
I think Mr. MacCormack
has a right to be heard.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.862
I just wanted to say a few words
about this motion...

01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:12.661
so that you wouldn't think
that we were...

01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:17.330
encouraging destruction
with this idea.

01:18:20.008 --> 01:18:24.035
''From the oldest of times, people
danced for a number of reasons.

01:18:25.113 --> 01:18:27.172
They danced in prayer...

01:18:27.249 --> 01:18:30.514
or so that their crops
would be plentiful...

01:18:30.585 --> 01:18:32.519
or so their hunt would be good.

01:18:33.855 --> 01:18:37.951
And they danced
to stay physically fit...

01:18:38.026 --> 01:18:41.587
and show their community spirit.

01:18:41.663 --> 01:18:44.496
And they danced to celebrate.''

01:18:47.402 --> 01:18:50.496
And that is the dancing
we're talking about.

01:18:51.573 --> 01:18:56.875
Aren't we told in Psalm 1 49?

01:18:59.614 --> 01:19:02.344
''Praise ye the Lord.

01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:05.545
Sing unto the Lord a new song.

01:19:07.522 --> 01:19:09.888
Let them praise his name
in the dance.''

01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:11.550
Amen.

01:19:12.827 --> 01:19:15.261
And it was King David--

01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:19.664
King David, who
we read about in Samuel.

01:19:19.734 --> 01:19:22.999
And what did David do?

01:19:23.071 --> 01:19:25.266
What did David do?
What did David do?

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:31.176
''David danced before the Lord
with all his might...

01:19:31.246 --> 01:19:36.377
leaping and dancing
before the Lord.''

01:19:36.451 --> 01:19:39.011
Leaping and dancing.

01:19:46.494 --> 01:19:49.554
Ecclesiastes assures us...

01:19:51.766 --> 01:19:54.462
that there is a time
for every purpose under heaven.

01:19:57.172 --> 01:19:59.106
A time to laugh...

01:20:00.175 --> 01:20:02.109
and a time to weep.

01:20:03.878 --> 01:20:05.436
A time to mourn...

01:20:06.715 --> 01:20:10.048
and there is a time to dance.

01:20:21.296 --> 01:20:24.322
And there was a time for this law,
but not anymore.

01:20:24.399 --> 01:20:26.924
See, this is our time to dance.

01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:32.337
It is our way
of celebrating life.

01:20:34.676 --> 01:20:37.144
It's the way it was
in the beginning.

01:20:38.747 --> 01:20:43.912
It's the way it's always been.
It's the way it should be now.

01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:07.097
You know you were railroaded,
don't you? Huh?

01:21:08.343 --> 01:21:12.507
When are you gonna wake up
and smell the coffee?

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:16.641
Shaw Moore walked into that meeting
with votes already in his pocket.

01:21:16.718 --> 01:21:19.516
- You didn't have a prayer.
- Bad pun, Andy.

01:21:22.023 --> 01:21:24.719
What are you gonna do now?

01:21:24.793 --> 01:21:26.226
It's over.

01:21:27.328 --> 01:21:29.296
What if it ain't?

01:21:29.364 --> 01:21:31.992
What if you have your dance
in Bayson?

01:21:32.066 --> 01:21:34.864
No. The whole point was
to do something here in Bomont.

01:21:34.936 --> 01:21:37.234
Bayson's, what,
thirty miles away?

01:21:39.107 --> 01:21:42.099
Not where it runs up
to these tracks it ain't.

01:21:45.013 --> 01:21:48.346
I figure if the Bomont fire trucks
can't cross these tracks...

01:21:48.416 --> 01:21:50.350
neither can the long arm
of the law.

01:21:50.418 --> 01:21:52.579
What about the long arm
of Reverend Moore?

01:21:52.654 --> 01:21:55.214
Remember he said if you could find
a way to convince him...

01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:57.554
it wouldn't be a spiritual
corruption, he'd think about it.

01:21:57.625 --> 01:22:00.651
- So?
- Make him think about it.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:09.759
''And I beheld and heard
an angel flying...

01:22:09.838 --> 01:22:13.171
through the midst of heaven
saying with a loud voice:

01:22:13.241 --> 01:22:16.699
'Woe, woe, woe...

01:22:16.778 --> 01:22:19.440
to the inhabiters of the earth.'

01:22:19.514 --> 01:22:24.747
And I saw a star fall
from heaven unto the earth...

01:22:24.819 --> 01:22:28.687
and the angel
was given the key...

01:22:28.756 --> 01:22:31.384
to the bottomless pit.

01:22:31.459 --> 01:22:35.862
And he opened
the bottomless pit...

01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:41.425
and there arose a smoke out of
the pit as smoke of a great furnace.

01:22:41.503 --> 01:22:46.497
And the sun and air were darkened
by reason of the smoke of the pit.''

01:22:48.543 --> 01:22:49.976
Yes?

01:22:50.044 --> 01:22:53.639
I used to get such a kick
watching you work up your sermons.

01:22:56.718 --> 01:23:00.245
- And now?
- It's different.

01:23:00.321 --> 01:23:05.953
I see the stage. I see costumes.
It's show business, isn't it?

01:23:08.396 --> 01:23:09.829
Well...

01:23:11.666 --> 01:23:16.228
it's the only way I know
to reach people's emotions.

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:22.900
I haven't heard from you
for a while.

01:23:25.146 --> 01:23:27.171
When was it? Thursday?

01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:30.517
I was angry, you were angry.

01:23:32.186 --> 01:23:34.120
- I was not.
- Yes, you were.

01:23:36.558 --> 01:23:40.585
If you weren't, you would've
asked me what was wrong. You knew.

01:23:40.662 --> 01:23:44.792
Ariel, I cannot let
this dance happen.

01:23:44.866 --> 01:23:47.027
Ren MacCormack made
a lot of people stop and think.

01:23:47.101 --> 01:23:49.865
I object to that kind of music,
and I think you know why.

01:23:49.938 --> 01:23:52.668
- Because people fornicate to it.
- I never said that.

01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:55.641
- You told the church board that.
- That was not meant for your ears!

01:23:55.710 --> 01:23:58.338
When do my ears get old enough?
When do you stop protecting me?

01:23:58.413 --> 01:23:59.778
I'm no saint!

01:23:59.847 --> 01:24:02.179
It is my duty to look after
the spiritual growth of you--

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:04.480
I'm not even a virgin.

01:24:07.021 --> 01:24:09.512
- Don't talk like that in here!
- Why not?

01:24:09.591 --> 01:24:14.051
Isn't this where I confess my sins
to my preacher? In church!

01:24:14.128 --> 01:24:18.121
I ask to be forgiven. Am I?
Oh, forgive me, deliver me!

01:24:18.199 --> 01:24:21.191
Don't do that in here. You
know better where to draw the line!

01:24:21.269 --> 01:24:23.703
Thank heavens you're here.
People are calling.

01:24:23.771 --> 01:24:26.331
They're over at the library.

01:24:30.712 --> 01:24:33.579
Roger! Eleanor!
What are you doing?

01:24:33.648 --> 01:24:35.582
We decided these books--

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:39.416
Who's we? Whose authority
are you acting on?

01:24:39.487 --> 01:24:41.682
Hold it everybody!
Listen to me!

01:24:43.891 --> 01:24:47.054
When did you all decide
to sit in judgment?

01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:54.095
Who elected you to be the saviors
of everybody's souls in Bomont?

01:24:54.168 --> 01:24:57.467
We have a perfect right to determine
what our children--

01:24:59.974 --> 01:25:04.104
When you've burned all of these,
what are you gonna do then?

01:25:06.648 --> 01:25:08.582
Chris, take these out of here.

01:25:11.419 --> 01:25:14.616
Satan is not in these books.

01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:17.249
He's in here!

01:25:17.325 --> 01:25:20.158
He's in your hearts.

01:25:20.228 --> 01:25:22.856
Go on home, all of you.

01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:25.228
Go and sit in judgment
on yourselves.

01:25:27.135 --> 01:25:29.968
And, Roger, go home.

01:25:31.205 --> 01:25:32.695
Eleanor, come on.

01:25:34.776 --> 01:25:36.744
Go home now, both of you.

01:26:14.849 --> 01:26:17.147
Sometimes things
don't make any sense.

01:26:17.218 --> 01:26:21.621
If you could explain to me my father
maybe I could explain your son.

01:26:23.524 --> 01:26:25.458
But it doesn't make any sense.

01:26:29.230 --> 01:26:32.165
Look, I gotta go.

01:26:34.836 --> 01:26:37.862
Listen, I know you're gonna do
what you gotta do...

01:26:37.939 --> 01:26:41.773
but thanks for listening.

01:26:48.616 --> 01:26:50.641
Thank you for--

01:26:53.354 --> 01:26:56.551
Well, thank you.

01:27:11.873 --> 01:27:14.740
That was your friend Ren.

01:27:14.809 --> 01:27:18.575
He came here to ask me if he could
take you to a senior prom.

01:27:24.085 --> 01:27:26.076
I'm running out of answers.

01:27:28.122 --> 01:27:30.090
I know how hard it is for you.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.928
I'm know I'm not making it easier.

01:27:41.269 --> 01:27:45.137
I just don't know that I believe
in everything you believe in...

01:27:48.409 --> 01:27:50.639
but I believe in you.

01:28:15.269 --> 01:28:20.639
I'm standing up here
before you today...

01:28:23.244 --> 01:28:25.508
with a very troubled heart.

01:28:29.784 --> 01:28:30.989
You see, my friends...

01:28:30.989 --> 01:28:31.921
You see, my friends...

01:28:33.625 --> 01:28:36.890
I've always insisted on...

01:28:36.962 --> 01:28:40.591
taking responsibility
for your lives.

01:28:41.867 --> 01:28:45.030
But, I'm really...

01:28:46.772 --> 01:28:49.434
like a first-time parent...

01:28:50.509 --> 01:28:53.273
who makes mistakes...

01:28:53.345 --> 01:28:56.712
and tries to learn from them.

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:02.242
And like that parent...

01:29:03.555 --> 01:29:09.391
I find myself at that moment
when I have to decide.

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:12.863
Do I hold on...

01:29:14.833 --> 01:29:19.099
or do I trust you
to yourselves?

01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:24.666
Let go and hope
that you've understood...

01:29:24.743 --> 01:29:28.440
at least some of my lessons.

01:29:32.885 --> 01:29:36.844
If we don't start trusting
our children...

01:29:36.922 --> 01:29:41.859
how will they
ever become trustworthy?

01:29:44.696 --> 01:29:47.597
I'm told that the senior class
at the high school...

01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:50.692
has got use of
the warehouse in Bayson...

01:29:50.769 --> 01:29:55.468
for the purpose of
putting on a senior dance.

01:29:56.909 --> 01:29:58.342
Please...

01:30:00.012 --> 01:30:04.779
join me to pray
to the Lord...

01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:06.841
to guide them
in their endeavors.

01:31:45.217 --> 01:31:46.411
Lights!

01:32:09.074 --> 01:32:11.042
- You look very nice.
- Oh, no.

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:13.873
Yes, you do.
Yes, you look very nice.

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:15.879
Yes, you do.
You look wonderful.

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:18.177
- You think?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:26.954
You can't very well go to a prom
without a corsage.

01:32:29.795 --> 01:32:31.786
Oh, Mom.

01:32:31.863 --> 01:32:33.888
This is gorgeous!

01:32:38.670 --> 01:32:41.264
- Where do you think I should--
- Here's a wrist thing.

01:32:41.339 --> 01:32:43.534
Oh, Mom, you really
didn't have to.

01:32:43.608 --> 01:32:45.041
I didn't.

01:32:48.814 --> 01:32:52.682
Don't go on to him about it
because he'll only deny it.

01:33:04.563 --> 01:33:08.727
I was gonna come up and get--
I was...

01:33:09.935 --> 01:33:12.495
gonna come up and get you.

01:33:12.571 --> 01:33:16.632
- What's the matter?
- You're beautiful.

01:33:20.212 --> 01:33:21.645
What?

01:33:29.755 --> 01:33:34.249
I mean it.
You are beautiful.

01:33:40.599 --> 01:33:42.032
Come on.

01:33:53.011 --> 01:33:54.444
Thank you.

01:36:04.476 --> 01:36:08.071
- Let's take a closer look.
- No. She'll think I'm checking up.

01:36:08.146 --> 01:36:10.671
No. She won't even know
we're here. Come on.

01:36:16.087 --> 01:36:18.920
You're the last folks I expected
to see around here tonight.

01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:21.754
- Good evening, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.

01:36:21.826 --> 01:36:23.953
Reverend, you done
a good thing here.

01:36:24.963 --> 01:36:26.988
I'm still not sure
it was the right thing.

01:36:27.065 --> 01:36:28.498
Comes close.

01:36:46.518 --> 01:36:47.951
Shaw?

01:36:58.697 --> 01:37:00.289
What is it?

01:37:04.903 --> 01:37:07.303
It's just the two of us again.

01:37:25.690 --> 01:37:28.124
- Shaw?
- What?

01:37:29.728 --> 01:37:32.094
We're almost dancing.

01:37:41.373 --> 01:37:43.841
- Hi, Rusty.
- Hi.

01:37:54.085 --> 01:37:55.780
Hello, Willard.

01:37:57.022 --> 01:37:58.956
You promised you won't fight.

01:37:59.024 --> 01:38:00.889
Don't you look sweet.

01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:08.254
- What do you want?
- I've got business with MacCormack.

01:38:08.333 --> 01:38:10.927
Cool it, all right.
No fights tonight, okay?

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.237
Hey, no fights, fellas.

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.873
Sure, Willard.

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:20.675
All right.

01:38:22.914 --> 01:38:25.781
Cute.
No fights, Willard.

01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:30.514
Damn, man! I told you.
I promised Rusty no fights tonight.

01:38:31.923 --> 01:38:34.289
Let me go, goddamn it!

01:38:35.427 --> 01:38:38.225
- Oh, Willard!
- What do you want me to do, Rusty?

01:38:38.296 --> 01:38:41.697
Kill the son of a bitch!
Help, somebody!

01:38:44.936 --> 01:38:49.339
- Chuck!
- Hey, it's Mr. Dance Fever.

01:38:49.407 --> 01:38:52.137
You're a goddamn hero
when it's five to one.

01:38:54.112 --> 01:38:56.740
Ren, get up!
Beat the shit out of him!

01:39:08.293 --> 01:39:09.783
Bastard!

01:39:14.265 --> 01:39:16.028
You're gonna dance now.

01:39:28.813 --> 01:39:30.246
All right!

01:39:35.253 --> 01:39:37.414
- Hey, handsome.
- Great dance, man.

01:39:37.489 --> 01:39:39.650
Fighter heroes!

01:39:39.724 --> 01:39:42.750
I thought you guys were
actually gonna fight or something.

01:39:42.827 --> 01:39:44.260
You're great.

01:39:44.329 --> 01:39:48.288
Hey, what's this I see?
I thought this was a party.

01:39:48.366 --> 01:39:49.993
Let's dance!

01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:13.523
Just watch, all right?

01:40:14.305 --> 01:40:20.482
