00:11.100 --> 00:13.567
- So all you really know is
that Kelsey took an Uber

00:13.633 --> 00:16.200
to Josh's last night?
- Yes, after midnight.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.667
- Well, maybe she's
just crashing there.

00:17.733 --> 00:19.900
- Or maybe...
- No, no, no, no.

00:19.967 --> 00:21.433
I don't think so.
That's not Kelsey or Josh.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.367
- I know, but, you know,
a little alcohol,

00:23.433 --> 00:24.733
a little commiseration.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.533
I mean,
they're both in their 20--

00:26.600 --> 00:29.533
why are we going on Barry?
- I am rerouting you.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.600
You don't need to walk
past Josh's to get to the L.

00:31.667 --> 00:34.567
- Well, so am I just supposed
to avoid his street forever?

00:34.633 --> 00:37.067
- Yes.
Never face a painful situation

Oh.
[chuckles]

00:53.133 --> 00:55.567
I thought you were sleeping.
- Nope.

00:55.633 --> 00:57.433
Not really sleeping much
these days.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.567
- I know what you mean.

00:59.633 --> 01:02.400
My brain is, like, buzzing
from this Liza thing.

01:02.467 --> 01:04.267
It's so insane.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.067
- Yeah, well, you're pretty much
the only person in the world

01:07.067 --> 01:08.833
that understands
what I've been going through.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.067
- Yeah, we're, like,
in Liza recovery together.

01:11.067 --> 01:13.167
- Mm, now first rule
of recovery,

01:13.233 --> 01:15.533
do not use the L-word.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.300
- Got it,
and the second rule?

01:19.367 --> 01:20.533
- Grits.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.333
- Grits?
- Grits.

Yeah, a little bit of cheese,
some bacon.

Do I two-step.

with Josh, dude.

Wow.

you didn't bang him?

Sometimes if you massage
the area just above it,

it helps release the spasm.

among your friends?

really think about that.

our situation any better.

uh, they're from Colin.

it was 200 pages too long.

full of strife and anxiety,

06:50.733 --> 06:54.267
people need a place of peace.

Hygge.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.867
The Danish art of comfort,
offers a cure.

06:58.933 --> 07:02.567
And the definitive guidebook
has become Empirical's very own

07:02.633 --> 07:05.233
"Getting Hygge With It."

07:05.300 --> 07:08.133
Now, our author,
Hans Pater Jorgen,

07:08.200 --> 07:10.067
is ending his 12-week tour here

07:10.100 --> 07:12.200
and rather than throwing a party
at some Danish restaurant,

07:12.267 --> 07:13.400
I thought it would be
more personal

07:13.467 --> 07:15.867
and in the spirit of Hygge

07:15.933 --> 07:17.500
to host

07:17.567 --> 07:19.200
at my home.

07:19.267 --> 07:22.067
- Isn't Hygge about being...

07:22.133 --> 07:23.933
cozy?
- Yeah.

07:24.067 --> 07:26.933
- I've been to your home, it's--
- Elegant, yes.

07:27.067 --> 07:29.067
I plan to Hygge it up.
You know.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.167
So, Saturday, 7:00 sharp.
There will be press,

07:32.233 --> 07:34.067
so I expect everyone
to bring a plus one.

07:34.067 --> 07:36.600
- Can Millenial help the book
with a online push?

07:36.667 --> 07:37.933

07:38.067 --> 07:39.867

Loosely Held,"

07:39.933 --> 07:42.533

tying our title

with Bobby Flay's
new fondue cookbook.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.167
- Also, the college interns
are making some memes,

07:47.233 --> 07:49.133
so maybe one of them
will go viral.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.800
- All right, once and for all,
can someone please explain

07:51.867 --> 07:53.500

07:53.567 --> 07:55.067
- I'm glad you asked.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.533
Um, I'm not sure
I understand either.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.400
- Well, the technical definition
is "a cultural item that's

08:01.467 --> 08:04.067
"transmitted by repetition
in a manner similar to

08:04.067 --> 08:07.267
the biological transmission
of genes."

08:07.333 --> 08:09.433
- No.
- Can you give an example?

08:09.500 --> 08:11.867
- Well, the Internet versions
are, like,

08:11.933 --> 08:13.667
funny photos or little videos,

08:13.733 --> 08:16.600
but the analog version
is, like, uh, "Kilroy was here."

08:16.667 --> 08:18.567
- Oh.
- Uh, uh, what about,

08:18.633 --> 08:20.067
uh, "keep on trucking"?
- Yeah.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.767
- "Where's the beef?"
- Exactly!

08:21.833 --> 08:23.333
- What are you guys
talking about?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.167
No, no, a meme is, like,

08:25.233 --> 08:29.067
a picture of a cat
that says stupid things like,

08:29.100 --> 08:32.800
"I can haz cheezburger."
Or Salt Bae.

08:32.867 --> 08:35.400
- Right.
Oh, Salt Bae.

08:35.467 --> 08:36.900

That is--it's so--

08:36.967 --> 08:38.733
that's so funny.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.967
Just whenever it's like...

08:41.067 --> 08:43.733
- Well, as long as
it's good for the book,

08:43.800 --> 08:47.567
may we all have a profitable
journey across the Salt Bay.

08:47.633 --> 08:50.067
- Hear, hear.

08:51.467 --> 08:54.667
- You really have no idea
what a meme is.

08:54.733 --> 08:57.667
I can't believe
I've been so blind.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.633
- It's the state of Montana,
actually.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.133
I painted it.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.733
- You're an artist?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.333
- Yeah, yeah.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.867
Not like you, but, yeah.

09:32.933 --> 09:36.667
- Well, I think it's beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

09:36.733 --> 09:38.233
- You know, I'm working on
some new paintings.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.367
You wanna come
check 'em out sometime?

09:40.433 --> 09:42.667
- Are you kidding?
Yes!

09:42.733 --> 09:44.667
- Text me when you're free.
- Okay.

09:44.733 --> 09:46.133
You know, the girl in
the next shift is running late,

09:46.200 --> 09:47.733
but I should be
getting off soon.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.633
- Oh, I have a feeling
you will be.

09:49.700 --> 09:52.133
See ya.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.833
[upbeat music]

09:53.900 --> 09:54.833
- Bye.

09:54.900 --> 10:00.467

10:00.533 --> 10:03.500
- Who knew there were
so many candle scents.

Mm.

Nostalgic Snow.

10:12.933 --> 10:15.233
- Nostalgic Snow?
What is that, old snow?

10:15.300 --> 10:17.033
Isn't that water?
Who cares?

10:17.100 --> 10:18.533
Throw it in.
It's on sale.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.900
We need to Hygge my place up.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.833
- Okay, who needs
a pillow this big?

10:25.900 --> 10:27.533
- Oh, that's a body pillow.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.100
You know,
for girls who can't get a man.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.167
[chuckles]
I obviously don't need one

10:31.233 --> 10:33.967
since I have Richard
to cuddle with.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.800
And when I say "cuddle,"
I actually mean--

10:35.867 --> 10:37.800
- That's nice.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.433
I miss cuddling.

10:41.233 --> 10:45.700
- It's too bad about you a Josh.

10:45.767 --> 10:46.967
It's never pleasant
to be dumped.

10:47.033 --> 10:49.533
- I didn't get dumped.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.200
We just--

10:51.267 --> 10:54.300
you know,
we wanted different things.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.733
- So you chose to be alone?

10:56.800 --> 11:01.067
Really, Liza, it's always best
to be honest with oneself.

11:01.133 --> 11:02.733
It's how we grow.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.800
Ooh, Mongolian lambskin.

11:04.867 --> 11:06.067
[soft dramatic music]

11:06.133 --> 11:07.467
We should keep the tags on these

11:07.533 --> 11:09.233
so we can return them
after the party,

11:09.300 --> 11:11.533
and by "we" I mean you.

11:30.233 --> 11:31.567
Is it possible
you got more beautiful

11:31.633 --> 11:33.067
since the last time
I saw you?

11:33.100 --> 11:34.567
- No.

11:34.633 --> 11:36.600
You just weren't
paying attention.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.233
- Well, I am now.
Trust me.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.067
- That may take some time.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.300
- Understood.
Look, I know I was a cliché

11:44.367 --> 11:47.667
letting all that attention
go to my head.

11:47.733 --> 11:50.767
Does it help to say
I know I've been a total ass?

11:50.833 --> 11:54.867
And that I'm truly,
truly sorry?

11:54.933 --> 11:56.667
- It's a good start.

11:56.733 --> 11:58.300
But you're gonna have
to do a lot more.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.767
- Like what?
- I don't know.

11:59.833 --> 12:02.367
I'm gonna think of something.

12:12.867 --> 12:14.733
There's Lauren and Max.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.100
Guys, you remember Colin.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.300
- Oh, you came to that party
at my apartment.

12:19.367 --> 12:20.933
You live on Roosevelt Island,
right?

12:21.067 --> 12:23.100
- Uh, no.
- Oh, sorry, you're the twin?

12:23.167 --> 12:25.467
- What?
- [laughs]

12:25.533 --> 12:27.167
Oh, it's not your fault, baby.

12:27.233 --> 12:30.433
Kelsey has a very specific type.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.100
- No, I don't.
- Mm, okay.

12:33.167 --> 12:34.733
Uh, here we go.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.667
Thad, Chad, Tram Slam,
this guy.

12:37.733 --> 12:39.467
- This guy?
- Yeah, they're all the same.

12:39.533 --> 12:43.167
6 foot, corn fed,
sandy blonde, sensible stubble.

12:43.233 --> 12:45.833
- I take it these are your exes?

12:45.900 --> 12:48.467
- Yeah, she can't help it.
She's a dopple-banger.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.167

been naughty?

[all talking at once]

12:54.867 --> 12:56.867
Hmm.

12:56.933 --> 12:59.133
You two.
Come with me.

[whacks]
- How do you like that?

13:05.300 --> 13:07.600
- I'd like it to be harder.

13:09.533 --> 13:10.800
[whacks]

13:10.867 --> 13:12.900
Harder.

13:12.967 --> 13:14.933
- Do you wanna try?

13:15.067 --> 13:16.167
- [exhales]

13:16.233 --> 13:17.500
I would love to.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.700
- Oh, no.

13:19.767 --> 13:22.167
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

Ah!

- Hey.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.067
- Uh, you don't usually
take Barry.

13:38.133 --> 13:41.833
- Yeah, uh, I was trying
to avoid Bedford.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.233
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.367
- So how are you?

14:06.533 --> 14:08.300
- Yep, I got it.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.767
- Oh, no,
I don't have any star anise.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.900
- Oh, here.
Use, um, caraway seeds.

14:12.967 --> 14:14.933
Here you go.
- We're out of, uh--

14:15.067 --> 14:17.233
- Oh, Havarti and Grinzola.
- I know this is a Hygge party,

14:17.300 --> 14:18.333
and it's supposed
to be relaxing,

14:18.400 --> 14:19.633
but it's hard to be relaxed

14:19.700 --> 14:20.633
when your guest of honor
is late.

14:20.700 --> 14:24.100
- I'll call him.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.533
- It's easy to see
why Diana leans on you so much.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.267
[chuckles]
- Yeah.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.133
- I mean, you don't have
to be a therapist

14:30.200 --> 14:32.133
to know that she has
some trust issues,

14:32.200 --> 14:33.967
but not with you.

14:34.067 --> 14:35.333
You're one of
the very few people

14:35.400 --> 14:38.233
she has complete faith in.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.367

nice to hear.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.967
- Hi.
How's your back?

14:55.067 --> 14:56.933
- Uh, it's better.
A little better.

14:57.067 --> 14:59.433
- Mulled wine should help.

- Hi.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.733

15:20.800 --> 15:22.700
- Oh, hey, you never
introduced me to your boss.

15:22.767 --> 15:25.667
- Oh, of course.

15:25.733 --> 15:28.800
Charles, this is
the notorious Colin McNichol.

15:28.867 --> 15:31.600
Colin, Charles Brooks,
my brilliant boss.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.067
- Charles.
- Colin, very nice to meet you,

15:34.133 --> 15:36.300
and, uh, I'm sorry
to hear about Random House.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.333
- Yeah, appreciate that.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.067
That was a surprise.
- What happened?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.167
- They dropped the option
on my second book.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.400
- When did that happen?

15:44.467 --> 15:45.933
- [chuckles]
Yesterday.

15:46.067 --> 15:47.933
Uh, bad move on their part.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.933
It's a great idea.
Can I tell you about it?

15:50.067 --> 15:52.167
- Uh, sure.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.500
- So imagine if the voyages
of Christopher Columbus

15:54.567 --> 15:56.533
were financed
by Catherine of Aragon

15:56.600 --> 15:59.400
instead of Isabella of Spain.

15:59.467 --> 16:01.900
- So I'm obsessed with
the complicated relationship

16:01.967 --> 16:03.733
that women have with power.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.600
How we can be vulnerable,
but predators at the same time.

16:06.667 --> 16:09.700
- Yes, the contrast
is so strong.

16:09.767 --> 16:13.567
- I-I really love it.
- Thanks.

16:13.633 --> 16:15.100
- If you ever need an assistant,

16:15.167 --> 16:17.467
I would be so into
helping you out.

16:17.533 --> 16:20.067
I could stir your paint.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.400
I could stretch your canvas.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.100
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:23.167 --> 16:25.733
- Well, that sounds like
an offer too good to refuse.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.933
- [giggles]
Oh, my God, okay.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.667
- What?
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry

16:29.733 --> 16:31.900
if I gave you the wrong idea.

16:31.967 --> 16:33.867
I'm such a gigantic fan
of yours.

16:33.933 --> 16:36.133
I'm just--I'm...
I'm straight.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.533
[both laugh]

16:37.600 --> 16:39.767
- Oh.
- I hope that's okay.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.367
- That's okay.
That's fine.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.567
Some of my best friends
are straight.

16:42.633 --> 16:44.667
- Okay, good.

16:44.733 --> 16:46.767
Good.
- Mm...

16:46.833 --> 16:48.233
but I have a show coming up
in a month,

16:48.300 --> 16:50.567
so if you're still interested,

16:50.633 --> 16:52.333
I could use the help.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.233
- Oh, my God, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.400
- I would love that.
- Yeah, great, fantastic.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.733
Well, come here.
I'll show you my stuff.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.067
- Okay.

17:01.733 --> 17:03.300
- Look, I know you don't
want my advice,

17:03.367 --> 17:04.867
but are you sure
it's a good idea

17:04.933 --> 17:06.333
to let Colin
back into your life?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.067
- What?

17:08.067 --> 17:09.267
- From the minute
you guys got here,

17:09.333 --> 17:10.933
he has been all over Charles.

17:11.067 --> 17:12.600
- What are you saying?

17:12.667 --> 17:14.167
- I-I don't trust him.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.067
- Oh, you don't trust him.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.500
[chuckles]
That's funny.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.467
- Okay, I'm only saying this
because I care about you.

17:21.533 --> 17:23.933
- You care about me?

17:24.067 --> 17:25.300
Do you really wanna
do this here?

17:25.367 --> 17:28.600
- Yes, I--
you know what...

17:28.667 --> 17:31.767
Of course I care about you.
Very deeply.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.933
That's why I wanna see you
with a good guy.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.667
You discovered Colin,

17:35.733 --> 17:37.933
you supported him through
the entire editing process,

17:38.067 --> 17:39.200
and the minute
he got successful,

17:39.267 --> 17:40.600
he didn't have time
for you.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.333
That is until
he needs you again.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.433
I was married
to a guy like that,

17:44.500 --> 17:46.200
and you deserve better.

17:46.267 --> 17:47.800
You deserve someone
who treasures you,

17:47.867 --> 17:49.433
who--who opens doors,

17:49.500 --> 17:51.667
who walks on the outside
of a sidewalk.

17:51.733 --> 17:53.833
- Okay, all right, what kind of
old lady lace curtain handbook

17:53.900 --> 17:55.867
is that out of?
Huh?

17:55.933 --> 17:59.267
Liza, stop pretending
to have a clue

17:59.333 --> 18:01.500
about how I think
or who I am.

18:01.567 --> 18:03.067
You know nothing.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.567
You don't even know
what a meme is.

18:04.633 --> 18:07.267
- Yes, I do.
Lauren just sent me one.

18:10.333 --> 18:13.067
- That's not a meme.
- It has meme font.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.667
How is that not a meme.
- It just isn't.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.400
- Well, then what the hell
is a meme?

18:16.467 --> 18:18.067
- You--you just know it
when you see it!

18:18.100 --> 18:19.900
Do you have any other questions?
- Just one.

18:19.967 --> 18:21.933
Why are you living with Josh?

18:22.067 --> 18:25.067
- Because he needed a roommate.
- And you're the only person

18:25.100 --> 18:27.333
that he could find?

18:27.400 --> 18:29.567
- I am the only person

18:29.633 --> 18:32.700
that understands
what he's going through.

18:32.767 --> 18:34.533
* *

18:34.600 --> 18:36.400
- Kelsey, just wait.
- [exhales sharply]

18:36.467 --> 18:38.067
* *

18:38.067 --> 18:39.700
- Let's go.
- But I was right

18:39.767 --> 18:42.067
in the middle of the--
- I need to go now.

18:42.067 --> 18:44.567
- I'll call you.

18:44.633 --> 18:47.800
* *

18:47.867 --> 18:51.333

I think Charles is interested
