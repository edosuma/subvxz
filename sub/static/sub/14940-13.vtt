Parish he'll put him in prison.

10:48.752 --> 10:50.987
You know, I didn't need you
to come along with me.

10:51.054 --> 10:53.189
Believe me,
it was not by choice.

10:53.257 --> 10:55.925
So you really think this has
something to do with Parish?

10:55.993 --> 10:59.329
Five unexplained deaths,
today of all days?

10:59.397 --> 11:01.031
It has to be connected.

11:01.099 --> 11:02.466
We need to find out
what killed them.

11:02.534 --> 11:03.667
[Sniffs]

11:03.735 --> 11:05.435
Could it be noxious fumes?

11:05.503 --> 11:07.337
This place smells like ass.

11:07.405 --> 11:11.242
Traces of methane,
sulfur, carbon monoxide.

11:11.309 --> 11:13.678
It's not enough to be toxic.

11:13.745 --> 11:16.381
I'm really surprised
you can hack it.

11:16.449 --> 11:18.750
One fart in an elevator
and you freak out.

11:18.818 --> 11:22.020
Hey! What's your problem?

11:22.088 --> 11:23.488
Well you almost got me killed,
so there's that.

11:23.556 --> 11:25.757
I'm sorry about that.

11:25.825 --> 11:27.426
It was a complicated situation.

11:27.493 --> 11:29.127
You know, beyond that it's
just this whole

11:29.195 --> 11:31.130
lack of loyalty
thing pisses me off.

11:31.197 --> 11:33.065
You weren't there, okay?

11:33.133 --> 11:35.268
It went too far.
You decided it went too far.

11:35.335 --> 11:37.236
If you're gonna sign up for
something stupid and dangerous,

11:37.304 --> 11:38.571
have the balls
to see it through.

11:38.639 --> 11:39.672
Pick a side.
Shh!

11:39.740 --> 11:41.241
What?

11:41.308 --> 11:44.777
Shh.
It's a heartbeat.

11:44.845 --> 11:47.914
I hear someone.

11:47.982 --> 11:50.350
He's scared.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
it's okay, it's okay.

11:52.787 --> 11:53.987
Hey, we're here to help.

11:54.055 --> 11:56.757
It's okay.
It's okay.

11:56.825 --> 12:01.629
Were you here?

12:01.697 --> 12:03.831
Do you want to tell us
what you saw?

12:03.899 --> 12:05.767
Just tell us what's wrong.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.068
[Pulsating tone]

12:07.136 --> 12:09.537
[All scream]

12:14.652 --> 12:16.420
This is ridiculous.

12:16.487 --> 12:19.489
Find Parish.

12:19.557 --> 12:22.158
I have no idea
where to look for him.

12:22.226 --> 12:24.161
Yes, you do.

12:24.228 --> 12:26.430
The bastard told you.

12:26.498 --> 12:28.232
Through Mitchell.

12:28.299 --> 12:31.669
I'm gonna watch the world
change with a God's eye view.

12:31.736 --> 12:33.303
God's eye view.

12:33.371 --> 12:37.441
I'll watch the world change
with a God's eye view.

12:37.509 --> 12:40.110
And where the hell is that?

12:40.178 --> 12:41.645
You'll figure it out.

12:41.713 --> 12:43.780
You know who you can trust.

12:43.848 --> 12:46.583
[Overlapping chatter
from paramedics]

12:50.655 --> 12:53.824
Okay, so the lights flash,
leave five men dead,

12:53.892 --> 12:56.060
and the only survivor left
is an Alpha.

12:56.128 --> 12:57.595
Or he was
turned into an Alpha.

12:57.663 --> 12:59.764
I mean, he seemed really freaked
out when he made that noise.

12:59.832 --> 13:01.966
This had to be caused
by a photostim.

13:02.034 --> 13:03.501
A photostim?

13:03.569 --> 13:05.236
Well, that'd be connected
to the power lines, right?

13:05.304 --> 13:08.072
Great, so we search
a gazillion miles of--

13:08.140 --> 13:10.175
Rachel, what is it?

13:10.242 --> 13:12.977
It's a grid protector.

13:13.045 --> 13:15.079
We put these in the power system
to protect it from Parish.

13:15.147 --> 13:16.414
And he put a photostim inside.

13:16.482 --> 13:19.017
We screwed ourselves.
Parish played us.

13:19.085 --> 13:23.655
They could be all over
the country, Rachel.

13:23.723 --> 13:25.457
Thanks for coming back.
We need the help.

13:25.525 --> 13:27.192
Well, I made
these things for Parish

13:27.260 --> 13:28.461
so some of this is on me.

13:28.528 --> 13:29.929
All right,
what set this thing off?

13:29.997 --> 13:31.932
Was it a remote?
A timer? What?

13:31.999 --> 13:34.802
No. The workers.

13:34.869 --> 13:38.306
They smashed it
with a hammer.

13:38.373 --> 13:39.740
Men are idiots.

13:39.808 --> 13:41.643
Thanks.

13:47.283 --> 13:50.318
8:18.

13:50.386 --> 13:51.886
That's when this thing
was supposed to go off.

13:51.954 --> 13:53.254
8:18 tonight.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.060
Evil, twisted son of a bitch.

13:58.127 --> 13:59.661
Every light on this grid
will flash.

13:59.729 --> 14:01.863
If you open the fridge,
you get zapped.

14:01.931 --> 14:03.598
We got crews
pulling 'em out,

14:03.666 --> 14:05.734
but we're talking over a million
in 19 different cities.

14:05.802 --> 14:07.269
They don't have time.

14:07.336 --> 14:08.904
I mean, it took these guys
a month to put these things in.

14:08.971 --> 14:10.138
We can't just take 'em out
in a couple hours.

14:10.206 --> 14:11.206
We have to cut the power.

14:11.274 --> 14:12.908
It's the only way.

14:12.975 --> 14:14.142
Pull the plug
on the national grid

14:14.210 --> 14:15.877
until we can rip
all these things out.

14:15.945 --> 14:17.646
Is that even possible
on the time we have left?

14:17.714 --> 14:18.947
I'll get things started on it.

14:19.015 --> 14:21.449
It won't work in New York.

14:21.517 --> 14:22.984
The lines have
dead man switches.

14:23.052 --> 14:24.920
It means the systems
keep going no matter what.

14:24.987 --> 14:28.157
That's right,
it's--it's a 9/11 thing.

14:28.224 --> 14:31.092
The system can't shut down
all at once.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.862
So how we gonna
get past this?

14:34.930 --> 14:37.365
Me.

14:37.432 --> 14:40.501
All right.
What do you need?

14:40.569 --> 14:43.672
You have to transfer her right
now, not in 24 hours.

14:43.739 --> 14:45.406
You know,
I'm a federal agent.

14:45.474 --> 14:46.908
You have to do
exactly what I say.

14:46.975 --> 14:48.743
I'll see what I can do
to hurry things along.

14:48.810 --> 14:51.579
Yeah, hurry things along.
Get on with it.

14:51.647 --> 14:53.982
- Gary?
- What--

14:54.049 --> 14:56.818
Oh, Dr. Rosen,
what are you doing here?

14:56.886 --> 14:57.819
- Hey, Gary--
- I need help.

14:57.887 --> 14:58.921
I need to get my mom out.

14:58.988 --> 15:00.122
Bill said it's not safe.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.690
I wanna move her
somewhere safe now.

15:01.758 --> 15:04.093
- Oh, how is she doing?
- Oh, she's boring.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.896
She's awake,
but she's just staring.

15:06.964 --> 15:08.564
Mom!

15:08.632 --> 15:09.999
Gary, I'm sorry
I haven't been here for you

15:10.066 --> 15:11.100
during all of this.

15:11.167 --> 15:12.869
I've--I've been busy.

15:12.936 --> 15:14.237
Yeah, you were busy--
you kidnapped someone,

15:14.304 --> 15:15.772
held them prisoner.
No, I was-

15:15.839 --> 15:17.239
- That takes time.
- I was doing what I could

15:17.307 --> 15:19.308
to stop Stanton Parish,
you know?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.344
Yeah, to kill him.

15:21.412 --> 15:23.780
No, Gary,
I was trying to protect people.

15:23.847 --> 15:25.481
No, Dr. Rosen, come on.
Don't lie to me.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.950
The same way you were trying
to protect your mother.

15:28.018 --> 15:29.718
No, you're lying to me.
You wanna kill him

15:29.786 --> 15:31.487
because of Dani.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.856
God's eye view, Gary.

15:33.924 --> 15:36.292
What is that?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.894
I don't know what it means.

15:37.961 --> 15:40.830
I need your help.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.633
I imagine God's eye view--
it has to be high up,

15:43.701 --> 15:47.371
and it obviously has some
significance for him.

15:47.438 --> 15:49.973
Well, his family
own lots of boats,

15:50.041 --> 15:51.975
but they're not very tall.

15:52.043 --> 15:53.777
They also own some stables.

15:53.844 --> 15:55.512
It--I don't like horses.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.413
They look confused.

15:57.481 --> 16:01.150
There's Shreve,
Lamb, and Harmon.

16:01.218 --> 16:02.485
What's that?

16:02.552 --> 16:03.852
Oh, they're architects,

16:03.920 --> 16:05.987
and Stanton Parish is on
the Board of Directors.

16:06.055 --> 16:08.624
And they--oh, oh, oh!

16:08.692 --> 16:10.059
They built
the Empire State building.

16:10.126 --> 16:14.230
God's eye view.

16:14.297 --> 16:16.866
Time to go.

16:16.933 --> 16:22.004
And tell him you won't see him
again because you're gonna die.

16:22.072 --> 16:25.340
Gary...

16:25.408 --> 16:29.678
working with you means--
means so much to me.

16:29.746 --> 16:32.815
I--seeing the world through
your eyes has been very special.

16:32.882 --> 16:37.219
Oh, yeah, I know.
I'm amazing.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.587
Thank you.

16:38.655 --> 16:40.823
Yeah.

16:40.891 --> 16:43.059
Oh, wait, Dr. Rosen.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.427
Mm?

16:44.495 --> 16:45.495
They're looking for you.

16:45.562 --> 16:47.296
You know that.
I--

16:47.364 --> 16:49.866
I should call them
because they could help you.

16:49.933 --> 16:51.368
No, Gary, please,
don't--don't do that.

16:51.435 --> 16:54.871
I have to ask you to keep
this--keep this conversation

16:54.938 --> 16:56.439
just between
the two of us.

16:56.507 --> 16:58.975
It's very important.

16:59.043 --> 17:01.611
I don't want any of you
to have to, uh, to--

17:01.679 --> 17:02.879
to have to share this...

17:02.947 --> 17:05.781
Uh, all of this.
You understand?

17:05.848 --> 17:09.451
Yeah, I understand.

17:09.519 --> 17:12.354
Thank you, Gary.

17:27.069 --> 17:29.838
Oh, what am I gonna do
when I find him?

17:29.906 --> 17:31.340
You stop him.

17:31.408 --> 17:34.309
How?

17:34.377 --> 17:36.178
How am I gonna stop him?

17:36.246 --> 17:38.547
How does he heal?

17:38.615 --> 17:41.650
How does he heal?
Yes.

17:41.718 --> 17:44.019
Okay.

17:44.087 --> 17:45.921
All right,
he must have some sort of

17:45.989 --> 17:48.624
enhanced neural
immune response system.

17:48.692 --> 17:53.229
It's gotta be voluntary

17:53.297 --> 17:56.298
so that he can actually will
his axons to regenerate.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.000
Yes.

17:58.068 --> 18:02.438
And I need to inhibit
that response.

18:02.505 --> 18:05.908
Anti-coagulants.
Methotrexate.

18:05.976 --> 18:09.344
So if he were injured
severely enough...

18:09.412 --> 18:11.814
Both: He wouldn't
be able to heal.

18:11.882 --> 18:16.786
It would be done.

18:16.854 --> 18:19.589
- This is a big hospital.
- Yes.

18:19.657 --> 18:21.125
It'll have everything
you need.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.488
Oh, God.
What the hell am I doing?

18:29.556 --> 18:31.123
I've never stolen
anything in my life.

18:31.191 --> 18:33.059
Aren't you doing
what's right?

18:33.126 --> 18:34.927
God, I don't even know
I believe

18:34.995 --> 18:36.261
in what I'm doing anymore.

18:36.329 --> 18:39.364
Well, he does.

18:39.432 --> 18:40.899
He did what he thought
was right,

18:40.967 --> 18:42.367
and he is not giving up.

18:42.435 --> 18:44.202
I know, I know.

18:44.270 --> 18:46.271
Oh, Dani.

18:46.339 --> 18:48.574
Ever since you died, I--

18:48.641 --> 18:49.641
I didn't die.

18:49.709 --> 18:51.376
I was murdered.

18:56.150 --> 18:58.785
Oh, God, where am I?

18:58.853 --> 19:01.488
The Empire State building.
Uh...

19:01.556 --> 19:03.757
I don't know
where the hell am I.

19:03.825 --> 19:06.793
Oh, I'll never make it.

19:06.861 --> 19:08.695
I've lost too much blood.

19:08.763 --> 19:09.963
Take the one
to the shuttle.

19:10.031 --> 19:12.298
Transfer
at Grand Central station.

19:12.366 --> 19:14.701
Yes.
Grand Central station.

19:17.872 --> 19:19.939
NYPD flagged this
off the BOLO.

19:20.007 --> 19:24.844
It's definitely Rosen,
and he's not looking good.

19:24.912 --> 19:26.212
All right,
what did he take?

19:26.280 --> 19:28.982
Wayfarin and heparin,
which are blood thinners.

19:29.050 --> 19:32.185
And then there was MXT,
which is a chemo drug. I--

19:32.253 --> 19:34.154
I don't get it, I mean,
he's obviously hurt.

19:34.222 --> 19:35.555
Why didn't he take
painkillers?

19:35.623 --> 19:38.391
There was Vicodin and Percocet
in the cabinet, but...

19:38.459 --> 19:40.494
He's bleeding.

19:40.561 --> 19:42.295
Blood thinners
aren't gonna help him.

19:42.363 --> 19:46.433
I know. Come on, doc,
what the hell are you doing?

19:46.501 --> 19:50.270
He shouldn't have done that.

19:50.338 --> 19:54.574
Dr. Rosen, he--he's really angry
about Dani dying.

19:54.642 --> 19:56.343
Just like I was angry
about Anna...

19:56.411 --> 19:59.947
and he's doing bad things.

20:00.015 --> 20:03.417
Go.

20:03.485 --> 20:05.620
Oh, that--
Mom, you just spoke.

20:05.687 --> 20:09.123
That's good.
Help him.

20:09.191 --> 20:12.593
I'm not--I, no,
I--I can't help him.

20:12.661 --> 20:14.028
I promised him
that I wouldn't--

20:14.096 --> 20:16.898
I wouldn't tell anyone
if he was in trouble.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.099
But I--what is that?

20:18.166 --> 20:20.101
What are you--
what is this?

20:20.169 --> 20:21.903
I'm gonna stay here
with you.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.237
Take care of you.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.806
What is--wh--
go.

20:24.874 --> 20:27.309
Go...I should go?

20:27.377 --> 20:29.512
Go.

20:29.579 --> 20:33.182
Mom, I...

20:33.250 --> 20:36.052
Yeah. Okay.
I'll--I'll go.

20:38.923 --> 20:42.659
Oh, I'm glad
that you didn't die, Mom.

20:54.739 --> 20:56.273
You close?

20:56.340 --> 20:57.707
Clock's ticking.
We got maybe an hour.

20:57.775 --> 21:01.077
No, really?
Stop bugging us.

21:01.145 --> 21:02.312
Is that my laptop?

21:02.380 --> 21:03.714
We needed your logic board.

21:03.781 --> 21:05.082
We gotta punch
through the failsafes

21:05.150 --> 21:06.116
if we're gonna kill
all the power in New York.

21:06.184 --> 21:07.284
It died with honor.

21:07.352 --> 21:09.319
Out!

21:09.387 --> 21:13.290
He's so pretty,
but so useless.

21:13.358 --> 21:16.127
- He's smarter than he looks.
- Ooh.

21:16.194 --> 21:17.761
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:17.829 --> 21:19.630
I didn't mean to insult
the man you love.

21:19.697 --> 21:23.834
I don't love Hicks.

21:23.902 --> 21:25.536
Okay, aren't you
almost done with that?

21:25.603 --> 21:27.237
Yep.

21:27.305 --> 21:29.506
Guess it's time
to go save the world.

21:34.245 --> 21:38.347
I brought you here when you
were eight years old, Dani.

21:38.415 --> 21:42.418
Your mother and I.

21:42.485 --> 21:47.323
We all took a tour
of the station.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.225
Right here.

21:54.665 --> 21:58.801
Wanted to show you
the constellations in the sky,

21:58.869 --> 22:00.803
but they're backwards.

22:00.871 --> 22:05.074
Heh. The tour guide
said it was a mistake,

22:05.142 --> 22:08.578
but the painter,
Paul Helleu,

22:08.646 --> 22:11.515
said that he painted them
that way

22:11.583 --> 22:15.553
because he wanted people
to see the stars

22:15.621 --> 22:17.389
from the other side
of the sky.

22:17.456 --> 22:18.490
Heh.

22:25.766 --> 22:27.900

22:27.968 --> 22:30.569
He's not at
the Empire State building.

22:33.273 --> 22:35.774
He's here.

22:54.427 --> 22:56.595

in all Parish-affected cities.

by for power down in New York.

23:33.401 --> 23:34.668

this is gonna work?

23:34.736 --> 23:36.536
I'm never sure.

23:36.604 --> 23:38.605
Best case, yeah.

23:38.673 --> 23:41.541
Okay. Worst case?

23:41.609 --> 23:43.243
Worst case,
this thing sets off

23:43.310 --> 23:44.611
an explosive
chain reaction

23:44.679 --> 23:46.113
that kills everybody
we're trying to save.

23:46.180 --> 23:48.248
Okay. Yeah.
That's worst.

all that crap you pulled.

24:37.695 --> 24:38.929
You did it.

24:38.997 --> 24:41.098
We did it.

24:41.166 --> 24:43.901
Mostly I did it.

24:43.969 --> 24:45.936
Whatever.

24:46.004 --> 24:48.672
Yay, team.

24:48.740 --> 24:51.174
Midtown,
the power's coming back on.

24:51.242 --> 24:54.878
It's spreading north.
Where else?

24:54.946 --> 24:57.114
It's just New York,
as far as I can see.

24:57.181 --> 24:58.682
It's working.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.617
Should be killing every
transformer on the grid.

25:00.685 --> 25:02.653
Then where's
the power coming from?

25:09.075 --> 25:11.710
See, nothing
to worry about.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.313
Oh. Oh, Dr. Rosen.

25:14.381 --> 25:16.382
Oh, Dr. Rosen.

Dr. Rosen.

25:18.418 --> 25:20.152
Gary, what are you
doing here?

25:20.220 --> 25:21.454
Oh, you're bleeding.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.189
That's why I'm here,
Dr. Rosen.

25:23.257 --> 25:24.390
Is that why you
took the medicine?

25:24.458 --> 25:25.658
Gary, you have
to leave right now.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.226
It's very dangerous
for you to be here.

25:27.294 --> 25:28.194
Yeah, I know
it's dangerous.

25:28.261 --> 25:29.361
You're bleeding.

25:29.429 --> 25:30.462
Please don't worry
about me.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.398
You have to go
right--right now, Gary.

25:32.466 --> 25:34.733
Go, please.
I can't allow you to be here.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.769
Parish is here.
No, Doc.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.937
No, I'm not gonna
go anywhere, Dr. Rosen.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.005
I get to make
my own choices.

25:40.073 --> 25:41.239
Gary, I realize that.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.974
No, you don't realize,
Dr. Rosen.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.410
Okay? You're bleeding
and you're alone.

25:45.477 --> 25:46.878
- Gary, I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

25:46.945 --> 25:49.146
You help everyone on the team
like you've helped me

25:49.214 --> 25:51.448
and like my mom helps me
so now it's fair,

25:51.516 --> 25:52.416
Dr. Rosen, that I help you.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.318
I'm not gonna go anywhere, okay?

25:54.385 --> 25:56.419
It's my turn.
It's my turn.

25:56.487 --> 25:58.455
- Okay, Gary.
- Yep.

25:58.522 --> 26:02.626
- All right.
- That's okay.

26:02.694 --> 26:05.896
It's a backup generator
somewhere and it's big.

26:05.964 --> 26:08.065
Putting out enough power
to light up half the city.

26:08.133 --> 26:09.767
Those should be
shut down too.

Okay, well,
whatever it is

26:14.339 --> 26:15.639
we got 45 minutes
to take it down.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.874
- Rachel.
- Well, we'll get everyone

26:17.942 --> 26:19.009
we got looking
for that power source.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.911
Okay, thanks.

26:20.979 --> 26:23.112
That was Gary.

26:23.180 --> 26:26.716
He's in Grand Central station.
He found Rosen.

26:26.784 --> 26:28.618
He thinks Parish
is there too.

26:28.686 --> 26:30.354
Maybe that's why
the Doc stole those drugs.

26:30.421 --> 26:32.389
He's going after Parish.

26:37.161 --> 26:38.562
Come on, Gary,
pick up.

to take with you?

27:13.832 --> 27:14.665
For what?
What's going on?

27:14.733 --> 27:16.033
We're evacuating.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.835
Okay, these things
are gonna go off in 40 minutes.

to the FEMA office in Tarrytown.

- We're giving up?
- No.

for the aftermath.

did to you last time.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.190
You are
an infuriating woman.

27:38.258 --> 27:40.026
Because I wanna do
the right thing?

27:40.093 --> 27:42.061
What about lying to me?

27:42.129 --> 27:43.796

the right thing?

Letting my Op get ambushed
so you could--

27:45.699 --> 27:47.433
so you could kidnap
some guy?

I have to be able to trust
the woman that I'm in love with.

27:50.270 --> 27:52.471
I mean, don't you get that?
Of course.

27:52.539 --> 27:56.075

you're in love with me?

28:00.480 --> 28:03.215

Of course.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.061

28:17.129 --> 28:18.796
to stop this whole thing
from happening.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.831
Okay, Bill, why would Parish
go to Grand Central station?

28:20.899 --> 28:22.700
'Cause with his freaky logic,
he wants to be

28:22.768 --> 28:24.568
in the middle of everything

28:24.636 --> 28:26.003
Yeah, and make sure
it happens.

28:26.070 --> 28:27.871
All right, so what's
in Grand Central station?

28:27.939 --> 28:29.072

the Apple store...

28:29.140 --> 28:31.608
trains, tracks.

28:31.675 --> 28:33.376
There's a generator
that's designed

28:33.444 --> 28:35.211
to keep the trains running
even if everything else

28:35.279 --> 28:37.480
in the city goes down,
but that's just for trains.

28:37.548 --> 28:40.583
No, that's the M42.
It's from the '30s.

28:40.651 --> 28:42.352
It can put out enough power
for half of Manhattan.

How do you know this?

28:43.454 --> 28:44.788
Uh, I don't know.

28:44.855 --> 28:45.789
Somebody must have shown me.

28:45.856 --> 28:46.957

28:47.025 --> 28:48.359
It's under
Grand Central somewhere.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.328

to the main box.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.774
I'll be able to see Parish
on the security camera.

have to finish this.

won't be any blood.

when it was still wet.

34:22.474 --> 34:25.376
1913, Charles Barber.

34:25.443 --> 34:26.909
Liberty Head.
Pure silver.

34:26.978 --> 34:28.945
Surprised no one dug it out.

34:29.013 --> 34:31.748
Certainly by now.

34:31.815 --> 34:35.284
But I'm afraid we move
through this world too quickly

34:35.353 --> 34:39.956
to notice things
of true value.

34:40.024 --> 34:42.860
Shut up!

34:57.176 --> 35:01.279
Firearm.

35:01.347 --> 35:04.916
How crass.

35:04.984 --> 35:09.554
She was everything to me,
Stanton.

35:09.622 --> 35:11.957
And you killed her.

35:18.531 --> 35:21.533
Yes, I did.

35:21.601 --> 35:23.768
For the greater good.

35:23.836 --> 35:26.972
My sweet Danielle
was everything to me.

35:27.039 --> 35:31.376
You have no right
to talk about her.

35:31.443 --> 35:33.578
Of course.

35:33.645 --> 35:36.280
My apologies.

35:36.348 --> 35:37.648
You'll forgive me,

35:37.716 --> 35:39.150
I have to make my way
to the main concourse,

35:39.218 --> 35:41.252
and you should get yourself
to a safe place.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.288
Please, Lee,
it's important.

35:44.356 --> 35:46.457
This is what you want.

35:46.525 --> 35:49.627
What?

35:49.694 --> 35:50.828
Wha--what do you
want from me?

35:55.534 --> 35:58.203
You don't know?

36:03.309 --> 36:08.546
In a few minutes,
I'll be a mass murderer.

36:08.614 --> 36:10.214
I'll have served my purpose.

36:10.282 --> 36:13.584
I can't kill
the damn thing.

36:13.652 --> 36:15.753
Parish crosswired and hardened
every access point.

36:15.821 --> 36:17.888
I'm gonna try to pull
all the breakers.

36:17.956 --> 36:19.156
You'll be the man
they need.

36:23.161 --> 36:25.696
I want you to lead them.

36:25.764 --> 36:29.433
Kill him.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.134
He murdered me, Daddy.

36:31.202 --> 36:33.403
He murdered
your little girl!

36:33.470 --> 36:36.572
Just put him
in the ground!

36:41.912 --> 36:43.613
No.

36:43.681 --> 36:45.014
No.

36:45.082 --> 36:46.850
No, I'm not gonna do it.

36:46.918 --> 36:49.686
I'm not that man.

36:49.754 --> 36:55.125
Because Danielle wouldn't
have wanted it this way.

36:55.193 --> 36:56.593
She knew
there was a better way.

37:02.066 --> 37:04.601
I couldn't find it.

37:04.669 --> 37:07.604
Well, we should have
looked harder.

37:13.378 --> 37:16.080
That's what
she would have wanted.

37:24.356 --> 37:25.289
[Gunshot]

37:42.269 --> 37:44.204
Bill, Kat, help Skylar.

37:44.272 --> 37:46.072
Rosen and Parish
were talking.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.008
I heard a gunshot.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.145
Okay.
Okay.

37:52.213 --> 37:53.714
Hey, keep working on that.

37:53.782 --> 37:56.617
- Okay.
- Which way?

37:56.685 --> 38:00.856
He's already starting
to heal, Doc.

38:00.923 --> 38:02.124
Now I know
you've got those drugs.

38:02.191 --> 38:03.592
Let's finish this.

38:07.663 --> 38:09.998
- No, Cameron.
- Shoot him up!

38:10.066 --> 38:14.469
You kill this bastard and
let's get the hell out of here.

38:14.537 --> 38:16.772
Cameron...

38:16.839 --> 38:20.008
If we kill him,
what does that make us?

38:20.076 --> 38:21.142
He killed Dani.

38:21.210 --> 38:23.111
I know.

38:23.179 --> 38:26.181
I know.

38:26.248 --> 38:27.882
But if we let him live...

38:30.419 --> 38:33.454
He'll live
with that pain forever.

38:36.325 --> 38:39.961
Don't do it, Cameron.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.729
Be the man that she loved.

39:10.491 --> 39:12.259
Cam?

39:20.870 --> 39:22.638
These aren't
all the breakers.

39:22.705 --> 39:23.873
There's another panel

39:23.940 --> 39:25.207
on the opposite side
of the building.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.542
Why would they split them?

39:26.609 --> 39:28.443
Security reasons.

39:28.511 --> 39:29.911
So people like you
and I can't shut it down,

39:29.979 --> 39:31.413
which is smart.

39:31.481 --> 39:33.181
We can't kill
the generator from here.

39:33.249 --> 39:34.550
The outgoing lines,

39:34.618 --> 39:35.918
they have to run through
this panel somewhere.

39:35.986 --> 39:37.119
We'll cut 'em.

39:37.187 --> 39:38.320
Shut down power
to the rest of the city.

39:38.388 --> 39:40.155
That's great,
we can save New York,

39:40.223 --> 39:42.191
but what about the lights
in the station?

39:42.259 --> 39:44.993
They're hardwired into
the generator, aren't they?

39:45.061 --> 39:48.097
We're screwed, right?

40:03.080 --> 40:04.580
Doc!

40:04.648 --> 40:06.783
Hicks!

40:06.850 --> 40:07.917
What happened?

40:13.791 --> 40:15.758
Oh, it's time.

40:15.826 --> 40:17.327
Run!
