WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.337
You jerk.
It's not funny.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.339
Yes, it is.
Stop it!

00:05.373 --> 00:07.408
(running footsteps)
(door slams)

00:07.441 --> 00:10.744
ANNOUNCER: Better Things.
All new Thursdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:13.013 --> 00:17.017
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.358
Hello?

00:52.920 --> 00:55.256
(woman laughs)

01:03.897 --> 01:05.899
(man and woman moaning)

01:07.601 --> 01:10.171
*

01:19.280 --> 01:20.648
*

01:20.681 --> 01:21.982
(Edgar moaning)

01:22.015 --> 01:23.083
Oh, my God.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.818
Jimmy?

01:24.852 --> 01:25.919
You're alive!

01:25.953 --> 01:28.088
What the hell are you doing?!

01:28.122 --> 01:29.990
Jimmy!

01:30.023 --> 01:32.493
Oh, no! Oh, dear God, no.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.129
Oh, wait.
No, I'm mad at you.

01:35.163 --> 01:38.065
Hmm. Well, look who's back.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.334
I... (gags) I...

01:40.368 --> 01:41.669
*

01:44.872 --> 01:46.507
*

01:58.486 --> 02:00.221
(flatulence)

02:02.223 --> 02:04.225
(Ty inhales sharply)

02:06.494 --> 02:08.396
Shok-ba delek.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.333
That's "good morning"
in Tibetan.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.868
No. I'm asleep.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.904
You'll want a shower.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.274
I have an outfit for you
in the closet.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.210
Ew. What actress du jour

02:22.243 --> 02:24.278
left her stuff here?

02:24.312 --> 02:26.980
Shailene Woodley?
Greta Gerwig?

02:28.182 --> 02:29.283
Little Big Olsen?

02:29.317 --> 02:30.684
No, it's all yours.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.486
You left a bunch of your things
at my old place.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.588
I did?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.158
(gasps)

02:38.192 --> 02:39.960
Holy shit!

02:39.993 --> 02:42.730
I've been wondering
where that is!

02:44.265 --> 02:46.300
(sighs loudly)
If you could be ready by 10:00,

02:46.334 --> 02:49.136
that would be magnificent.
The gang's coming over

02:49.169 --> 02:50.504
for our standard
Saturday morning

02:50.538 --> 02:53.006
yoga brunch slash
crossword jam.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.209
Oh, I can't make it.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.745
It's literally downstairs.
(phone chimes)

03:04.552 --> 03:08.222
Actually, I could use
a Bloody Mary or five.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.858
I'm gonna take you up
on that shower.

03:10.891 --> 03:11.859
Not yet.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.060
Mmm...

03:13.093 --> 03:15.095
(sniffing)

03:16.964 --> 03:18.866
I'm really glad
you called, Gretchen.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.100
Thanks, Ty.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.870
(chuckles, snorts)

03:24.972 --> 03:27.775
Oh, wait.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.281
Okay, cool.
It's all you.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.316
(moaning)

03:37.285 --> 03:40.254
*

03:42.055 --> 03:45.192
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:45.225 --> 03:47.295
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:47.328 --> 03:49.663
* Gonna leave you anyway.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.709
(Lindsay laughing)
EDGAR: Jimmy.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.245
Bro, I have so many questions,
but first,

04:05.279 --> 04:07.281
bring it in.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.483
Come on, now.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.118
Let's do this.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.553
(Jimmy groaning)

04:12.586 --> 04:14.922
Bring... it... in.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.790
Ah...

04:20.961 --> 04:22.129
So?

04:22.162 --> 04:23.897
As an act of charity,

04:23.931 --> 04:25.499
I'm not going to eviscerate you

04:25.533 --> 04:28.268
for apparently moving
into my bedroom,

04:28.302 --> 04:30.438
or defiling it
with Lindsay,

04:30.471 --> 04:33.273
of all single-celled
life-forms.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.075
I am not single-celled.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.244
I've got cells you've
never even heard of.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.112
What are you two doing?

04:39.146 --> 04:40.648
I warned you
dating Lindsay

04:40.681 --> 04:41.815
would be a disaster.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.116
Joke's on you, cupcake.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.785
We're just friends
with benefits.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.020
(clicks tongue)

04:47.054 --> 04:49.857
Where's, um...
where's Gretchen, anyway?

04:49.890 --> 04:52.159
I texted her "hey,"

04:52.192 --> 04:53.761
but she hasn't responded.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.996
Gretchen's staying at my
apartment, which used to be

04:56.029 --> 04:58.499
a rando's apartment, which
used to be an apartment

04:58.532 --> 05:00.133
where they hid
Cambodian boat people.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.669
It's a whole thing.

05:01.702 --> 05:05.138
I should probably go talk
to her, like a man.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.374
She can give me
a tongue-lashing,

05:06.407 --> 05:07.975
let out all
of her anger.

05:08.008 --> 05:11.445
Also, I'm sure she's dying
to see the book.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.514
Mm. I wouldn't go over there.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.685
Sorry, why?

05:17.718 --> 05:18.952
What's there to talk about?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.954
You bounced, she moved on.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.723
End of story.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.626
Well, there are some things
that I would like to discuss.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.561
Like a man.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.463
(scoffs)
Do you really want to
see how much better

05:29.497 --> 05:31.031
she's doing without you?

05:34.201 --> 05:36.804
Well, I'm out.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.539
Great sex, bud.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.408
Real horny.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.182
Wow.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.951
(door closes)

05:52.853 --> 05:54.888
Good to see you, too, Jimmy.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.223
Oh, thank you.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.627
Wow.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.564
(door opens, closes)

06:04.765 --> 06:05.966
(door opens)

06:07.234 --> 06:09.169
Is that your hot rod
in the driveway?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.004
Yes.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.540
It is really cool.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.608
I would like
to ride in it sometime.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.312
(door closes)

06:26.053 --> 06:28.055
*

06:34.828 --> 06:36.830
(indistinct chatter)

06:39.099 --> 06:41.101
(indistinct chatter)

06:47.675 --> 06:49.477
Mmm.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.512
*

07:05.693 --> 07:07.060
Get out.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.962
What? Who are you?

07:08.996 --> 07:10.163
I'm the wine guard.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.131
Unauthorized!

07:11.164 --> 07:12.399
Get out!

07:12.432 --> 07:15.503
Out! Out! Out!

07:15.536 --> 07:19.139
(laughs)

07:19.172 --> 07:20.240
I'm sorry.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.342
You're really guarding the wine?

07:22.375 --> 07:25.646
Yeah. For cool people like us.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.115
Here.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.517
Ty's parties used to be
way more fun

07:29.550 --> 07:31.318
before Gavin Rossdale
convinced everyone

07:31.351 --> 07:33.453
to go to A.A.
I didn't bang

07:33.487 --> 07:35.923
your nanny, bro, why do we all
have to be punished?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.625
So...

07:37.658 --> 07:39.259
Who dragged you here?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.294
Oh, I woke up here.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.932
You're a Ty girl.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.301
Uh, I'm not a Ty girl.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.103
I'm surprised he let you
out of the bedroom.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.706
It's been a minute since I've
seen one of you out in the wild.

07:52.740 --> 07:56.176
That Little Big Olsen once
made me a pretty good omelet.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.379
You should probably hurry back.

07:59.412 --> 08:03.216
Well, you should probably
suck my dick.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.384
You should probably

08:04.417 --> 08:05.686
e-eat your own farts
and then you should

08:05.719 --> 08:07.788
suck my dick again.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.856
(laughs):
What?

08:10.724 --> 08:11.992
Mm-hmm.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.795
(rapid knocking on door)

08:14.828 --> 08:16.897
Can you believe that guy?!

08:16.930 --> 08:18.966
I know. Who?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.133
Jimmy!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.535
He disappears for three months,

08:21.569 --> 08:22.903
and then just waltzes

08:22.936 --> 08:26.139
back in like nothing
ever happened.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.675
He's a psychopath.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.976
A total psychopath!

08:29.009 --> 08:30.377
Sociopathic psychopath

08:30.410 --> 08:33.313
with borderline
personality disorder.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.884
Do you know much money I spent
setting up 1-833-RU-JIMMY?

08:36.917 --> 08:39.186
You can't just go straight
Richard Simmons on fools

08:39.219 --> 08:41.021
and expect them to be fine

08:41.054 --> 08:44.558
when you reappear without
explanation-- who does that?!

08:44.592 --> 08:46.526
He didn't just leave
Gretchen on that mountain,

08:46.560 --> 08:48.095
he left all of us up there.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.163
He better stay away
from Gretchen.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.200
I don't need her farting up my
couch for the next three months.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.235
Yeah, you really got
to throw that thing out.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.371
Mmm. Mmm.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.708
Wait, didn't we just do this,
like, two hours ago?

09:00.741 --> 09:03.110
Did we? Eh, it's Saturday.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.377
Good point, bud.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.518
SHITSTAIN:
It's actually worth it.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.754
You don't really see
any kind of marine life-- oh.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.556
Here is my and Jaclyn
at the Old Lahaina Luau.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.558
We sat with two non-Hodgkin
lymphoma researchers from Akron.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.027
(laughs)

09:20.060 --> 09:22.562
Oh, and, uh, here we are
at Waipu'ilani Beach.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.898
No more honeymoon photos!

09:24.932 --> 09:26.033
Unless it's that one

09:26.066 --> 09:27.367
of Jaclyn on
that whaling boat

09:27.400 --> 09:28.902
where her titties
are all oiled up.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.704
That one's highly erotic.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.139
I'm sorry Honey Nutz
couldn't make it.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.808
He had to attend
his godson's wedding.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.645
His godson's wedding?

09:37.678 --> 09:40.047
How old is Honey Nutz's godson?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.215
I'm not sure, that does seem
a little weird.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.483
Yeah, how does the math
work on that?
Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

09:43.516 --> 09:44.785
I've always wondered that.
He's young...

09:44.818 --> 09:46.219
Yeah, that's-that's true.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.322
Well, you fellas seem
to be doing great.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.258
(laughs)

09:51.291 --> 09:54.795
I can't believe I didn't even
think to ask this earlier.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.497
How's, um, Gretchen?

09:57.530 --> 09:58.766
Oh, bitch is great.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.100
Sucks y'all broke up,

10:00.133 --> 10:02.670
but sometimes you got
to let a good one go.
Yeah.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.437
Gretchen is thriving.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.739
Great.
Yeah.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.141
I am happy to hear that.
Yeah, oh, I mean,

10:08.175 --> 10:10.944
all of her photos from Europe
look like she's having a blast.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.813
Europe?
SAM: Yeah, she went
to Europe for work.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.949
She said the Daft Punk guys
let her try on their masks,

10:15.983 --> 10:17.484
but the laser show
messed up her phone

10:17.517 --> 10:19.486
so she couldn't
get a picture.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.588
How long's she been in Europe?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.623
Three months, about.
Yeah. Last time we saw her

10:23.657 --> 10:25.625
was right before Mahler's Ninth
at the Hollywood Bowl.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.327
Right?
Yeah, I can't believe
they have fireworks

10:27.360 --> 10:29.596
after a symphony about
Mahler's daughter's death

10:29.629 --> 10:31.932
and his impending death

10:31.965 --> 10:34.167
and the death of
tonality itself.
Hmm.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.037
But hey, modern audiences want
that razzle dazzle.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.171
(both laugh)

10:38.205 --> 10:40.107
Good-ass mushroom polenta, too.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.274
Good-ass mushroom polenta.
So good.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.509
So yummy.
It's usually...

10:42.542 --> 10:45.178
Wow. Three months, huh?

10:45.212 --> 10:46.980
Right. Very yummy.
It's a little crusty,

10:47.014 --> 10:48.348
a little crusty.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.283
WOMAN:
Mats, everyone.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.652
GRETCHEN:
Bye, Ty!

10:52.686 --> 10:55.055
Thanks for the bagel.
(whispers): And the oral sex.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.524
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're
not driving, are you?

10:57.557 --> 10:58.992
Hey, hey, hey.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.160
Hey, hey.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.328
Oh, no.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.396
Gretchen's 100.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.833
Just had a wee bit of wine.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.367
Smell you later, Cochise.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.002
Hey, Boone. Can you
do me a favor

11:09.036 --> 11:10.070
and take Gretchen home?

11:10.103 --> 11:11.204
She lives right by you.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.306
Call Uber, like a normal person.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.042
No, they stopped
picking me up months ago

11:15.075 --> 11:17.845
'cause I tried to get my driver
to drag race Angelyne.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.814
Fine.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.215
But no pee breaks

11:22.249 --> 11:23.817
and no pit stops.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.019
I was supposed to be back
in Eagle Rock hours ago.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.520
Eagle Rock!
(laughs)

11:27.554 --> 11:28.688
Dork.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.525
You are a gem.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.866
(exhales)

11:38.899 --> 11:40.267
Can we go now,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.035
or you guys still need
to do hand stuff?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.036
(scoffs)

11:43.070 --> 11:44.704
Get out of here.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.606
Careful.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.441
Bye, Boonie.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.945
(singing along to radio):
* Bill collector called today

11:51.979 --> 11:53.213
* Shove

11:53.246 --> 11:57.417
* The IRS is on my case

11:57.450 --> 11:58.852
* Shove

11:58.886 --> 12:01.421
* My boss says
I should comb my hair *

12:01.454 --> 12:02.956
* Shove

12:02.990 --> 12:06.259
* My father says
I'm going nowhere... *

12:06.293 --> 12:07.694
Hey, hey, hey.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.862
Uh, I'm right over here.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.030
Uh, the real ugly one.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.365
(Gretchen sighs, laughs)

12:12.399 --> 12:14.401
Look at that
stupid-ass car.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.803
Hey! Small dick!

12:15.836 --> 12:18.205
Show me your micro...

12:18.238 --> 12:20.573
Drive! Drive!
What?

12:20.607 --> 12:22.609
Drive!
Stop hitting me!

12:22.642 --> 12:23.610
I don't even
know you.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.744
Drive!
No!

12:24.778 --> 12:25.979
(engine revving)
No!

12:26.013 --> 12:27.214
(moaning)

12:27.247 --> 12:28.715
(sighs)

12:28.748 --> 12:31.151
(moaning continues)

12:35.322 --> 12:38.125
(high-pitched
moaning, grunting)

12:38.158 --> 12:39.259
(screams)

12:39.292 --> 12:40.894
(Lindsay shrieks)
Jimmy!

12:40.928 --> 12:42.930
Oh, my God!

12:42.963 --> 12:46.967
Where are the two of you
not having sex?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.235
What are you doing here?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.603
I'm... I'm dropping off
Gretchen's stuff.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.839
LINDSAY: Well, the last
thing Gretchen needs

12:51.872 --> 12:53.941
right now is to see
your dumb face.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.775
I thought you said she was fine.

12:55.809 --> 12:56.776
Well, she's not.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.011
Okay? You devastated her.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.847
She didn't leave this
apartment for months.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.449
And this is not
a good apartment.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.785
Well, then, clearly,

13:05.819 --> 13:08.355
Gretchen needs to face her anger

13:08.388 --> 13:10.457
so she can finally be at peace.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.826
What time do you think
she'll be home?

13:12.860 --> 13:13.827
'Cause I can wait.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.295
No!
No!

13:15.328 --> 13:16.663
Jimmy, we're
doing things.
No! Stay away
from her

13:16.696 --> 13:18.498
or I will murder you.
You're making us

13:18.531 --> 13:19.666
uncomfortable, Jimmy.
I will!

13:19.699 --> 13:21.835
I've done it before.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.770
I think I hate him,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.605
and I've never
hated anyone before.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.708
Not even that drill sergeant
who called me "Egg."

13:28.741 --> 13:31.611
Oh. Poor Egg.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.082
Hey, all that fighting
got me cranked up.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.452
Yeah, okay.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.521
Oh...
(Edgar groans)

13:41.554 --> 13:44.291
(both moaning, panting)

13:44.324 --> 13:46.726
(singing in Korean)

13:54.101 --> 13:55.735
Cool place.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.038
It's always nice to see my
buddies from the Korean War.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.907
Why are you being
such a dick?

13:59.940 --> 14:02.309
Hmm. Let me see.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.576
Because I didn't want to give

14:03.610 --> 14:05.045
a strange, drunk girl
a ride home

14:05.078 --> 14:07.047
and now she's dragged me
to a terrible bar.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.982
It's always the same,
as soon as I'm around

14:09.016 --> 14:10.217
a Ty girl.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.719
Either it's
A) warn her that Ty sucks,

14:12.752 --> 14:14.387
or B) be forced into
building a relationship

14:14.421 --> 14:16.323
with someone
I'm never gonna see again.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.892
Just so you know, it's not
my first go-around with Ty.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.393
You're back for seconds?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.162
Damn, either he
really likes you,

14:22.195 --> 14:24.531
or you are super
messed up.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.399
I like to think both.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.969
(singing in Korean)

14:32.572 --> 14:36.009
I once got a DUI
bringing him tacos.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.745
You're Tragic Taco Girl?

14:38.778 --> 14:41.248
Holy shit!

14:41.281 --> 14:44.952
I was the one who had to bring
him tacos later that night.

14:44.985 --> 14:48.288
Sounds like you guys have
a really weird thing going on.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.356
Don't get me wrong.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.091
I love Ty.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.294
It's just...
he's always been a mess.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.296
He got so drunk at my wedding,

14:56.329 --> 14:57.965
he tried to bang the cantor.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.866
Oh.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.368
And when was this?

15:01.401 --> 15:02.902
2009.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.604
He actually used to be
a really good friend.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.607
Now he's just interested
in his cool "industry" pals.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.609
He's got no time to play
foosball with Boone,

15:09.642 --> 15:12.312
but he can go on an Alaskan
cruise with Elvis Mitchell.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.115
He even went to Standing Rock
with Matt McGorry.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.584
They got into a fight
over who's more woke.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.119
It's Matt McGorry, right?

15:19.152 --> 15:20.153
Obviously.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.222
I mean, I get
that he had to do

15:22.255 --> 15:23.923
all sorts of attachment therapy
as a kid

15:23.957 --> 15:25.592
because hugging his mom
made him throw up,

15:25.625 --> 15:26.659
but Jesus Christ.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.161
Whoa.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.762
This is some really good gossip.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.065
Uh, another bottle
of soju, please.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.833
You're going hard tonight.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.303
Have you ever had a day

15:36.336 --> 15:38.671
that starts with
one bad decision

15:38.705 --> 15:44.077
and then it's just a cascade
of bad decisions

15:44.111 --> 15:46.513
until you're like, "Well,

15:46.546 --> 15:49.282
might as well burn down
the whole town tonight"?

15:51.318 --> 15:52.619
No.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.988
*

15:55.022 --> 15:57.390
(Gretchen gasping,
Boone grunting)

16:00.060 --> 16:01.861
Ow, ow! You're on my hair.
Sorry.

16:01.894 --> 16:02.929
No, I like it.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.831
(both laugh)

16:06.666 --> 16:07.867
(grunting continues)

16:15.908 --> 16:17.844
Listen, Jimmy.
I really need

16:17.877 --> 16:18.945
to talk to you.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.148
Why won't Gretchen respond?

16:21.181 --> 16:22.949
I texted her
yesterday.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.551
"Hey, dot dot dot..."

16:24.584 --> 16:26.686
Which is delightfully neutral

16:26.719 --> 16:28.721
and decidedly open-ended.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.057
Maybe she's not texting you
because she knows

16:30.090 --> 16:31.391
the only reason
you're checking in

16:31.424 --> 16:33.160
is to make yourself
feel better.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.495
(chuckles)
What?

16:35.528 --> 16:38.165
Yeah. Maybe Gretchen wants
to get on with her life

16:38.198 --> 16:39.566
and never think about you again.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.702
Maybe she thought
you were dead, Jimmy.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.471
Checking tips on the hotline.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.307
Coming home, night after night,
to an empty house

16:47.340 --> 16:50.009
with only your scent on your
pillow to cling to for comfort,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.979
until it, too, faded away
and she was left

16:53.012 --> 16:56.349
all alone with nobody
to make breakfast ramen for.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.719
Alone with, with nothing
but her scentless pillows

16:59.752 --> 17:02.255
and haunted thoughts of all
friends she lost in the w...

17:03.223 --> 17:05.125
(voiceless):
War...

17:06.526 --> 17:08.027
Uh...

17:08.061 --> 17:09.028
I'm...

17:09.062 --> 17:11.931
I am sorry

17:11.964 --> 17:14.667
that I worried you, Edgar.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.170
That was
insensitive.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.538
But I suppose,

17:18.571 --> 17:19.706
in a way,

17:19.739 --> 17:22.075
I abandoned you, too.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.813
I mean, I was talking
about Gretchen, but...

17:30.483 --> 17:33.320
...apology accepted.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.623
(Jimmy whimpers)

17:36.656 --> 17:38.658
(Edgar growls happily)

17:43.096 --> 17:45.465
Did you really smell my pillows?

17:47.234 --> 17:49.402
No...

17:51.771 --> 17:53.039
Hey, you know what?

17:53.072 --> 17:55.308
Maybe I'll make us
some dinner waffles

17:55.342 --> 17:56.309
for old times' sake.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.777
But that's it!

17:57.810 --> 18:00.213
I'm not making
breakfast anymore.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.081
Up for discussion.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.756
(typing)

18:11.791 --> 18:13.160
(deleting text)

18:13.193 --> 18:16.929
(typing)

18:18.465 --> 18:20.933
(deleting text)

18:24.103 --> 18:26.072
(grunts)

18:26.105 --> 18:27.407
Here you go.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.008
Del Taco.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.310
Hope there's no Del
Scorcho sauce on this.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.778
(laughs)

18:31.811 --> 18:34.080
Thought there were some
Coffee Bean ones in there.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.615
A bit classier.

18:35.648 --> 18:39.419
You know, Ty is still
one of my best friends.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.088
Ouch. Usually I don't
get the "regret text"

18:42.121 --> 18:43.990
till later in the night,
but yeah, sure,

18:44.023 --> 18:45.492
we can do this
face-to-face.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.626
Just trying to be honest.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.428
You know, tell you my truth.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.165
Got it. Cool.
(laughs)

18:53.666 --> 18:56.002
Nice to meet you.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.205
Bye, Gretchen.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.678
* Why don't we

19:05.712 --> 19:07.547
* Do those things

19:07.580 --> 19:09.982
* That lovers do

19:10.016 --> 19:12.885
* Lovers do

19:12.919 --> 19:15.722
* Why don't we do

19:15.755 --> 19:17.990
* Those things, things

19:18.024 --> 19:20.493
* Things, things

19:22.495 --> 19:27.200
* We can sit in the rain,
touch it and complain *

19:27.234 --> 19:32.171
* But I'd rather
just take you home and chill *

19:36.876 --> 19:38.010
* Chill.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.979
* Get loose now, go Chi-Town

19:40.012 --> 19:41.848
* Get loose now

19:41.881 --> 19:43.216
* St. Louis, get loose now

19:43.250 --> 19:44.517
* New Orleans...

19:44.551 --> 19:47.254
EDGAR:
Oh. Yeah. Oh!

19:47.287 --> 19:48.988
Oh. (laughs)

19:49.021 --> 19:51.658
You know, I almost texted
Gretchen again earlier.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.760
Jimmy.
Uh, no, I didn't do it.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.262
I wrote about a
hundred drafts,

19:55.295 --> 19:57.029
but couldn't
get it right.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.865
Probably for the
best, you know.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.900
Out of sight, out of...

20:20.820 --> 20:21.888
Hey!

20:24.324 --> 20:26.459
Dot.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.094
Dot.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.129
Dot!

20:40.573 --> 20:42.809
(car door closes)

20:42.842 --> 20:45.077
(car driving away)

20:49.115 --> 20:51.318
Oh, shit.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.296
(doorbell buzzing)

21:05.665 --> 21:07.600
(tires screech)

21:09.502 --> 21:11.237
JIMMY:
Gretchen!

21:11.270 --> 21:13.606
Gretchen, I need to talk to you.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.274
Cool your horses, I...

21:15.308 --> 21:17.143
Gretchen.
What?!

21:25.184 --> 21:26.786
I'm sorry.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.589
I-I don't know
what to say,

21:29.622 --> 21:31.190
other than I'm sorry.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.793
I'm deeply, deeply sorry
for what I did.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.595
You did not deserve

21:35.628 --> 21:37.196
such ill treatment.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.831
I'm sorry.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.536
Okay.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.976
But you did say "family."

21:59.051 --> 22:01.020
What did you just say to me?

22:01.053 --> 22:05.324
No. No, i-it, it just...

22:05.358 --> 22:08.361
This-this whole thing,
with my dad dying,

22:08.395 --> 22:10.329
and then you said

22:10.363 --> 22:14.166
that we were gonna be a family
now and so, understandably,

22:14.200 --> 22:17.837
in the moment, I got scared.

22:17.870 --> 22:22.041
You got scared because
you asked me to be your wife,

22:22.074 --> 22:25.578
and I said yes, and then
I used the word "family"?

22:25.612 --> 22:27.847
Yes.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.987
Oh, my God.

22:35.021 --> 22:38.157
I did say "family."

22:38.190 --> 22:40.560
I forgot about that.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.633
I'm so sorry.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.502
Oh.

22:49.536 --> 22:52.605
Well, thank you.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.509
I just wanted
to tell you my truth.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.911
