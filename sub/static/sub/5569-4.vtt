00:02.503 --> 00:03.969
<i>Previously on</i> scream queens...

00:03.971 --> 00:05.504
Today is the day
that I declare my intention

00:05.506 --> 00:06.505
To run for president
of kappa house.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.040
All of your lives are in danger.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.041
There are dead bodies.

00:09.043 --> 00:09.942
<i>Real-life dead bodies.</i>

00:09.944 --> 00:11.176
Weston:
<i>Dean munsch,</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:12.978
You got to shut down
this campus immediately.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.514
Grace:<i> We have to file</i>
<i>a missing persons report.</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:16.949
Someone's kidnapped zayday.

00:16.951 --> 00:20.119
Ladies, we have a pumpkin patch
fund-raiser to attend to.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.123
Hester:
<i>I am so excited. I cannot wait</i>
<i>to meet cliff woo.</i>

00:24.125 --> 00:25.858
Chanel #5:
<i>Who's cliff woo?</i>

00:25.860 --> 00:27.526
Chanel #3:<i> He's a party planner.</i>
<i>He did chanel's sweet 16.</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:28.994
The theme was
"let them eat cake,"

00:28.996 --> 00:30.829
So my dad bought me this
foreclosed mcmansion

00:30.831 --> 00:32.364
Down the street, and, like,

00:32.366 --> 00:33.565
<i>500 of my closest friends</i>
<i>came dressed</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:35.367
<i>In 18th century attire,</i>
<i>and, oh,</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:38.137
The pool was filled with this,
like, caviar slurry.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.639
And then at midnight,
we just burnt the house down.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.541
When the firefighters came,
they were actually strippers,

00:42.543 --> 00:44.643
And they put out the fire
with champagne.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.978
Chanels, this is cliff woo.

00:45.980 --> 00:46.979
So walk me
through this, honey.

00:46.981 --> 00:48.080
Well, as you can see,

00:48.082 --> 00:50.215
Every pumpkin in
the patch is artisanal.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.017
Ooh, good.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.352
Love the warty white ones.

00:53.354 --> 00:56.355
They look like number five
when she runs out of concealer.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.923
Then we move past
the ice sculptures

00:57.925 --> 00:59.091
Of demonic peeing cherubs--

00:59.093 --> 01:01.193
And yes,
they will all be peeing

01:01.195 --> 01:03.429
Vodka and red bull.
Love!

01:03.431 --> 01:05.431
And that brings us right over
here to the corn maze.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.899
Chanel:
I'm sorry.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.534
Corn maze?
I know. It's just that

01:08.536 --> 01:10.903
Doing an exact replica
of the maze from<i> the shining</i>

01:10.905 --> 01:13.072
Would've taken us way
over budget on manpower alone.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.506
I told you money was no object.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.542
I am gross rich, cliff.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.543
So get me, with great haste,

01:17.545 --> 01:19.611
My exact replica

01:19.613 --> 01:21.080
Of the maze from<i> the shining</i>

01:21.082 --> 01:22.614
With knee-deep snow drifts.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.517
I'll see what I can do.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.088
Okay, music.

01:29.090 --> 01:29.888
Go.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.390
I contacted adam levine

01:31.392 --> 01:33.092
And maroon 5 is in.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.393
Great. Go.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.961
Okay, well, the good news is,

01:35.963 --> 01:38.063
I talked to fergie's agent,
and she's in.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.099
The bad news is-- and
this is totally on me--

01:40.101 --> 01:42.101
But I googled "fergie's agent"

01:42.103 --> 01:43.535
And ended up talking
to this british guy

01:43.537 --> 01:45.804
Before I realized his
client was actually

01:45.806 --> 01:48.073
Sarah ferguson,
duchess of york.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.808
So, my bad,
both fergies are coming.

01:49.810 --> 01:50.809
So stupid.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.077
But go.

01:52.079 --> 01:52.978
Okay, so, um,

01:52.980 --> 01:55.080
I wasn't able
to get led zeppelin.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.816
What?!
Well, apparently,
one of them died or something.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.084
Damn it, number five.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.720
Do you have any idea
what's at stake here?

02:01.722 --> 02:04.723
If this black hairy tongue
pumpkin patch maze concert

02:04.725 --> 02:06.125
Isn't the biggest thing to
ever happen to this campus,

02:06.127 --> 02:08.260
I will lose
the kappa house presidency

02:08.262 --> 02:10.095
And chad radwell will dump me.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.964
Okay, well, it's not my fault
that some guy died in the '70s.

02:11.966 --> 02:15.000
Excuse me?
Then whose fault is it,

02:15.002 --> 02:16.001
Mine?

02:16.003 --> 02:18.270
I am tired of the excuses,
number five.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.939
I am tired of your sad-sack,

02:20.941 --> 02:22.741
I'm-a-total-downer-all-the-time
schtick.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.144
I ask you to reunite

02:25.146 --> 02:27.312
One legendary
rock and roll outfit

02:27.314 --> 02:28.947
So that guys will show up
to my patch,

02:28.949 --> 02:31.583
And you're all
like, "oh, some guy died."

02:31.585 --> 02:34.086
(stomps)
I'm over it!

02:36.290 --> 02:38.357
We still have
one more thing to do.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.766
Oh, my god,

02:47.768 --> 02:48.867
Why are you so depressed?

02:48.869 --> 02:51.670
My husband was shot
in dallas, idiot.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.938
For this year's Halloween,

02:52.940 --> 02:54.106
The chanels will be going

02:54.108 --> 02:56.808
As the wives
of fallen presidents.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.877
I am jackie kennedy.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.779
Number six, you will be going

03:00.781 --> 03:03.148
As the emotionally fragile
ida mckinley,

03:03.150 --> 03:05.617
Whose husband was felled
by an anarchist's bullet.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.785
Number three,

03:06.787 --> 03:07.986
You will be going

03:07.988 --> 03:10.355
As homely and religious
lucretia garfield,

03:10.357 --> 03:12.024
The bereaved wife

03:12.026 --> 03:13.458
Of president james garfield.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.493
Hold up. No way.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.994
Why do I have to
be the homely one?

03:15.996 --> 03:17.863
There's only so many murdered
presidents, number three.

03:17.865 --> 03:18.664
What about mary todd lincoln?

03:18.666 --> 03:20.499
Chanel #5 is lady lincoln, obvi.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.000
Wait, what do you mean, obvi?

03:22.002 --> 03:23.035
Just a second, nutbag.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.037
If you're gonna be
a pain about it,

03:25.039 --> 03:26.471
I guess we could open it up
to presidents

03:26.473 --> 03:27.806
Who were almost assassinated,

03:27.808 --> 03:29.808
So you can either
be betty ford--

03:29.810 --> 03:31.677
Which means you'll have
to get wasted

03:31.679 --> 03:33.045
And stay wasted all night--

03:33.047 --> 03:34.046
Or you can be

03:34.048 --> 03:36.381
Alleged hollywood mattress
nancy reagan.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.649
Dibs. I'm nancy reagan.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.552
Wait, why am I
mary todd lincoln?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.421
God, do I have to spell it
out for you?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.655
You're out of your frigging
gourd, number five.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.991
You're a weird, psycho lunatic

03:45.993 --> 03:47.993
Who's gonna end up
in an asylum somewhere,

03:47.995 --> 03:49.828
Staring at a wall,
trying to nurse a watering can.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.597
You're a mary todd lincoln
if ever there was one.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.398
That's it!
I can't take this anymore!

03:53.400 --> 03:55.701
That is such a mary todd lincoln
thing to say.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.102
No!

03:57.104 --> 03:59.705
I am done with you, chanel,
and I mean it.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.673
Do you mean it, number five?

04:01.675 --> 04:04.910
Because you scream "I'm done
with you" kind of a lot,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.378
And yet
you're still standing here.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.547
Do you know what I think?

04:08.549 --> 04:10.415
I think you know you have
a good thing going.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.050
You get to bask
in my starlight

04:12.052 --> 04:13.885
As I do all the work

04:13.887 --> 04:16.722
And you get to grumble
behind my back

04:16.724 --> 04:19.057
About how disrespected you are.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.094
Well, you know
what you can do?

04:22.096 --> 04:25.564
You can either dress up
as mary todd lincoln

04:25.566 --> 04:28.033
And help me win this presidency,

04:28.035 --> 04:30.736
Or you can pack
your things and leave.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.137
There's the door.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.941
There's the door, bitch!

04:41.081 --> 04:43.248
I am so sorry, chanel.

04:43.250 --> 04:47.119
You did not deserve
to be spoken to like that.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.187
Ever.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.928
¶ don't close your eyes ¶

04:56.930 --> 04:59.564
(screaming)

04:59.566 --> 05:03.902
¶ don't fall asleep ¶

05:03.904 --> 05:06.571
(screaming continues)

05:08.142 --> 05:13.045
¶ don't turn around ¶

05:14.748 --> 05:19.718
¶ I'll bury you deep ¶

05:23.157 --> 05:26.425
¶ whispers turn to screams ¶

05:30.664 --> 05:34.032
¶ you belong to me ¶

05:40.874 --> 05:44.009
¶ you belong to me ¶

05:45.879 --> 05:48.113
¶ to me. ¶

05:58.525 --> 06:00.258
All right.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.227
I've gathered

06:02.229 --> 06:04.329
Your two houses here
because it seems like

06:04.331 --> 06:07.065
You are the students most likely
to be killed

06:07.067 --> 06:08.200
By the alleged psychopath.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.501
Weston: And we got to make
a real plan

06:09.503 --> 06:11.703
To keep you guys
safe going forward.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.038
Wait, wait, hold on.
We can't move forward

06:13.040 --> 06:14.373
Because we are not all here.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.007
Why isn't anyone
doing anything

06:16.009 --> 06:17.075
About zayday's abduction?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.710
Because clearly this
fake kidnapping

06:18.712 --> 06:19.978
Is a play to get
the sympathy vote.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.012
So<i> gone girl.</i>

06:21.014 --> 06:22.514
That is bollocks!

06:22.516 --> 06:23.882
No, you're thinking
of<i> gravity.</i>

06:23.884 --> 06:26.017
Everybody stop!

06:26.019 --> 06:27.219
Now,

06:27.221 --> 06:29.087
Dean munsch,

06:29.089 --> 06:32.157
Are you or are you not
closing down the campus?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.861
Yes.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.729
No! No!
No!

06:37.731 --> 06:38.697
Why?

06:38.699 --> 06:39.865
It's Halloween!

06:39.867 --> 06:41.166
This is the biggest candle
night of the year!

06:41.935 --> 06:42.901
I hate you right now!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.403
(indistinct shouting)

06:45.406 --> 06:46.471
Order in the court!

06:47.941 --> 06:50.742
I took a class last semester

06:50.744 --> 06:52.511
Called "american presidents"

06:52.513 --> 06:54.246
Or something like that.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.214
And they taught us
about a man

06:56.216 --> 06:59.951
Named
john fitzpatrick kennedy, jr.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.920
And that dude wrote a book
about the time he served

07:01.922 --> 07:04.823
In vietnam called
<i>profiles in courage.</i>

07:06.059 --> 07:09.795
Is that not what we are
talking about right now?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.863
Courage?

07:13.901 --> 07:16.535
Halloween is
the greatest night of the year.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.303
Greatest night.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.905
Because on this night,

07:19.907 --> 07:21.940
Even kind of shy,
kind of homely girls

07:21.942 --> 07:23.909
Dress up like total sluts.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.944
I mean, every costume is just
a slutty version of something.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.279
Slutty teacher,

07:27.281 --> 07:28.580
Slutty nurse,

07:28.582 --> 07:30.215
Slutty nun.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.951
I saw a girl last year
dressed as slutty al-qaeda.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.986
Are we gonna deny ourselves

07:34.988 --> 07:37.722
The sluttiest night
of the whole year

07:37.724 --> 07:39.958
Out of fear?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.093
Will you look at caulfield?

07:42.095 --> 07:44.296
This dude got his arms

07:44.298 --> 07:46.898
Sawed off;
he's not hiding out.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.899
He is down to rage!

07:47.901 --> 07:49.901
Hell, yeah, I am.

07:49.903 --> 07:50.969
See, Halloween...

07:50.971 --> 07:54.105
It's a night for dudes
with killer bods

07:54.107 --> 07:55.674
To walk around
with our shirts off.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.109
And it's totally appropriate,
as long as we call ourselves

07:58.111 --> 08:00.145
Gladiators,

08:00.147 --> 08:01.413
Chippendales.

08:01.415 --> 08:02.647
As our great 60th president

08:02.649 --> 08:05.350
John kennedy jr. Said...

08:07.087 --> 08:08.687
"the only thing we have to fear

08:08.689 --> 08:11.089
Is fear itself."

08:13.026 --> 08:15.694
Well, in this case,
serial murderers, too.

08:15.696 --> 08:19.464
But we are not afraid of either
of those things, uh-uh.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.032
So...

08:22.202 --> 08:23.668
...Canceling Halloween sucks.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.606
Thank you.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.877
I have no idea how
you got into this college.

08:33.614 --> 08:37.282
And, sorry, curfew is on.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.618
Halloween, canceled.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.653
(indistinct shouting)

08:41.655 --> 08:43.054
Girls, it's okay!

08:43.056 --> 08:45.891
Look, we'll just hang out
and play charades!

08:45.893 --> 08:47.559
No! No! We won't!

08:47.561 --> 08:49.127
This cannot be happening!

08:49.129 --> 08:50.629
Hey, what about
black hairy tongue disease?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.998
I mean, does nobody here care
about black hairy tongue?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.466
What about my pumpkin patch?

08:55.002 --> 08:56.001
Sorry.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.102
Not sorry.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.540
Chanel.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.974
I blame you for this.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.912
Hester, nice boobs.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.984
Chanel:
<i>Dear student body,</i>

09:12.986 --> 09:14.219
<i>As you all know by now,</i>

09:14.221 --> 09:17.088
<i>Dean munsch has decided</i>
<i>to cancel Halloween.</i>

09:17.090 --> 09:18.256
<i>My daddy's lawyers said there</i>
<i>wasn't enough time</i>

09:18.258 --> 09:19.491
<i>To file an injunction</i>

09:19.493 --> 09:20.859
<i>And that I clearly</i>
<i>don't understand</i>

09:20.861 --> 09:22.027
<i>What an injunction is</i>

09:22.029 --> 09:23.895
<i>If I asked them to file one</i>
<i>in this situation.</i>

09:23.897 --> 09:25.313
<i>That said,</i>

09:25.314 --> 09:26.730
<i>I refuse to allow dean munsch</i>
<i>to keep us</i>

09:26.733 --> 09:27.933
<i>From stopping the scourge</i>

09:27.935 --> 09:29.267
<i>That is</i>
<i>black hairy tongue disease</i>

09:29.269 --> 09:31.002
<i>In its black hairy tracks.</i>

09:31.004 --> 09:33.572
<i>So, while I will honor</i>
<i>the Halloween curfew,</i>

09:33.574 --> 09:36.875
<i>I will not let anyone miss out</i>
<i>on coming out in costume</i>

09:36.877 --> 09:38.343
<i>To support a great cause</i>

09:38.345 --> 09:39.911
<i>And to make me look</i>
<i>really good.</i>

09:39.913 --> 09:41.880
<i>That is why I am opening</i>
<i>my charity pumpkin patch</i>

09:41.882 --> 09:44.249
<i>At 12:01 a.M. On November 1.</i>

09:44.251 --> 09:45.884
<i>It will be on the corner</i>

09:45.886 --> 09:47.752
<i>Of awesome street</i>
<i>and totally bitchin' avenue.</i>

09:47.754 --> 09:49.721
<i>Join me in saying</i>
<i>you are not afraid!</i>

09:49.723 --> 09:50.956
<i>And remember...</i>

09:50.958 --> 09:51.890
Chanel oberlin

09:51.892 --> 09:52.924
Is above the law.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.993
(computer beeps)

09:59.933 --> 10:02.233
Hey, chanel #5.
What are you doing?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.102
Just baking some cookies

10:04.104 --> 10:05.370
For the neighborhood
trick-or-treaters.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.572
Mmm, what kind?

10:07.574 --> 10:09.040
Uh, they're toenail cookies.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.076
What?!

10:11.078 --> 10:13.478
I noticed last year that a lot
of neighborhood children

10:13.480 --> 10:15.080
Have been dressing up
for Halloween as chanel.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.781
Wearing classic chanel looks

10:16.783 --> 10:18.149
That I helped come up with.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.651
Pink fur coats

10:19.653 --> 10:21.319
Worn in all weather--

10:21.321 --> 10:22.487
My idea.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.089
Flapper dresses made
out of feathers--

10:24.091 --> 10:25.457
Also my idea.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.758
Oversized sunglasses
worn everywhere--

10:26.760 --> 10:30.061
My idea, my idea, my idea!

10:30.063 --> 10:33.632
So why are you baking
toenail cookies

10:33.634 --> 10:35.500
And giving them to children?

10:36.937 --> 10:40.739
Why are you hurting them,
instead of hurting chanel?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.273
Okay, whose side are you on?

10:42.275 --> 10:43.942
Because very recently,

10:43.944 --> 10:45.977
You called me a bitch
and then showed me

10:45.979 --> 10:47.145
Where the door was.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.147
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.117
I'm what you call
a "switch-hitter."

10:52.119 --> 10:53.351
Wait, are you bisexual?

10:53.353 --> 10:54.452
Because that's what
"switch-hitter" means.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.787
Do you mean
"double agent"?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.088
Okay, what, yeah.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.090
A double agent.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.093
See, I have an idea.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.999
Jennifer, can we talk
to you for a second?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.870
What are you writing?
A tart missive to dean munsch
for canceling Halloween.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.638
Do you know
how big

11:13.640 --> 11:15.607
Halloween is
in the candle community?

11:16.777 --> 11:18.276
(gasps)

11:20.380 --> 11:22.013
Is this an ant farm?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.815
Actually, it's an ant family,

11:23.817 --> 11:24.883
This is the sandberg family.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.151
There's about a million of them.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.386
There's a mom ant, deborah,

11:28.388 --> 11:30.455
Who mostly just lies around and
she has about 100 husband ants,

11:30.457 --> 11:32.457
Who come around
and give it to her good,

11:32.459 --> 11:34.659
Which she really enjoys.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.961
And then there's about
a million sterile daughter ants

11:36.963 --> 11:39.197
Who feed her
and are her slaves.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.133
So, an ideal family.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.735
So zayday is running
for president.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.004
And she's going to lose.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.639
There are only eight girls
in this house.

11:47.641 --> 11:50.375
You guys,
chanel and chanel #3

11:50.377 --> 11:51.976
Will all vote for chanel,

11:51.978 --> 11:55.313
Which means zayday would
need sam and me and grace

11:55.315 --> 11:57.816
To all vote for her,
and then it'd be a tie

11:57.818 --> 11:59.551
And chanel remains president.

11:59.553 --> 12:03.054
But if chanel #5
and you and I

12:03.056 --> 12:04.055
Throw the votes
to zayday...

12:04.057 --> 12:05.857
She'd win.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.259
And then I'd beg to be
her second-in-command,

12:08.261 --> 12:09.828
While quietly pull the
strings behind the scenes

12:09.830 --> 12:11.196
Like dick cheney.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.031
Chanel #5 will be rewarded
by getting to run

12:13.033 --> 12:15.500
The pumpkin-patch-shining-
fergie-and-fergie-concert.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.901
I don't really want that.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.271
And maybe you will get
a really exciting job

12:20.273 --> 12:22.240
Like treasurer.
(slow gasp)

12:22.242 --> 12:25.844
This plan involves a lot
of circuitous logic.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.012
Like, why would zayday just
make you vice president?

12:28.014 --> 12:31.015
Wouldn't she ask grace? I mean,
they're, like, best friends.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.617
Chanel has a closet full
of diptyque candles

12:32.619 --> 12:34.018
That she lights once

12:34.020 --> 12:36.087
And then throws away
because they're used.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.288
What?!

12:37.290 --> 12:39.157
Show me.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.863
(screaming)

12:44.865 --> 12:47.031
Oh, my god!
Those are, like, $100 each!

12:47.033 --> 12:49.033
They're the highest
quality candles

12:49.035 --> 12:51.035
That can be purchased retail.

12:51.037 --> 12:54.205
I could melt them down
into one large candle!

12:54.207 --> 12:56.975
What a brilliant
and revolutionary idea.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.544
So what do you say?

13:07.487 --> 13:10.822
(indistinct whispering)

13:17.898 --> 13:20.965
Excuse me,
ms. Oberlin?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.000
Are you cheating?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.101
God, no.

13:23.103 --> 13:23.935
Kai zi is my asian.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.770
Excuse me?

13:25.772 --> 13:27.071
He's not in this class.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.807
He's not even enrolled
in this school.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.408
I keep him on retainer
to come take tests with me.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.943
Anything math or science...
Hand in your test.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.611
I'm reporting you
to dean munsch.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.480
This is a clear violation
of the honor code.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.115
You must be new here.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.983
Who are you calling?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.618
My daddy.
I'm gonna get you fired.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.786
(knocking)

13:41.788 --> 13:43.488
Man:
Excuse me, professor?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.424
Hi, it's chanel.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.159
Yes, thank you so much.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.762
Chanel oberlin.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.870
Chanel oberlin?

13:58.872 --> 14:01.339
You are under arrest for
the murder of ms. Agatha bean.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.444
(crowd clamoring)

14:06.446 --> 14:08.146
Chanel:
<i>Chin up, chanel.</i>

14:08.148 --> 14:09.981
<i>At least you wore</i>
<i>something nice today.</i>

14:09.983 --> 14:11.883
<i>Remember to smile</i>
<i>for your mug shot.</i>

14:11.885 --> 14:12.951
<i>It'll be on gawker by sundown.</i>

14:12.953 --> 14:15.220
Chanel:
Oh, my god!

14:15.222 --> 14:16.988
<i>I'm burping uncontrollably</i>
<i>like robert durst.</i>

14:16.990 --> 14:18.523
<i>They'll know I'm guilty!</i>

14:30.370 --> 14:32.637
(siren wailing)

14:32.639 --> 14:35.139
(faint music playing)

14:43.049 --> 14:45.016
Hello?

14:45.018 --> 14:46.818
Hello?!

14:46.820 --> 14:49.254
Somebody help me!

14:54.861 --> 14:57.228
(music gets louder)

15:02.002 --> 15:06.704
¶ do you really
want to hurt me? ¶

15:06.706 --> 15:11.442
¶ do you really want
to make me cry? ¶

15:11.444 --> 15:16.281
¶ do you really
want to hurt me? ¶

15:16.283 --> 15:20.685
¶ do you really want
to make me cry? ¶

15:24.224 --> 15:28.359
¶ do you really
want to hurt me? ¶

15:28.361 --> 15:30.895
(screaming)

15:30.897 --> 15:34.499
¶ do you really want
to make me cry? ¶

15:55.755 --> 15:58.656
Ah, I'm glad you're all here.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.092
It's lunchtime.
Where else would we fake eat?

16:01.094 --> 16:03.428
Now that chanel
is finally under arrest,

16:03.430 --> 16:06.064
We can start doing things
the way we want around here.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.332
And the first matter
of business should be

16:07.334 --> 16:08.766
To find our kidnapped
sister zayday.

16:08.768 --> 16:09.934
Actually, as number three,

16:09.936 --> 16:11.970
I'm next in line
and in charge here.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.938
And you can sum up my viewpoint
on this with one word--

16:13.940 --> 16:15.340
Indifference.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.108
Guys, zayday is out there.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.843
Probably getting
tortured right now.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.178
We are her only hope.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.846
Look, I'm all for zayday
not being tortured

16:21.848 --> 16:23.982
Or killed or whatever,
but don't you think

16:23.984 --> 16:25.984
A girl who wants
to be president of this house

16:25.986 --> 16:27.018
Should be able
to prove her abilities

16:27.020 --> 16:28.453
By escaping
from the lair

16:28.455 --> 16:30.088
Of a psychopath?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.422
That has nothing to do with

16:31.424 --> 16:32.957
Being sorority president.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.759
Actually, in this sorority,
it would be

16:34.761 --> 16:36.361
A pretty powerful
campaign platform.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.997
Sometimes, in order for a person
to achieve their full potential,

16:38.999 --> 16:40.531
They have to do things
on their own.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.367
Are you guys
seriously going to desert

16:42.369 --> 16:43.368
Our friend like this?

16:43.370 --> 16:45.803
I am in charge here!

16:45.805 --> 16:47.772
Need I remind you that there
is a curfew on this campus

16:47.774 --> 16:49.941
And this house is already
on dean munsch's poop list?

16:49.943 --> 16:51.976
What do you think is going to
happen if she catches us all out

16:51.978 --> 16:54.345
Checking every closet and
killer's lair to find zayday?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.981
She'll finally have grounds
to kick us all off campus.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.850
How do you think
making all of us

16:58.852 --> 17:00.852
Get expelled is protecting us?

17:00.854 --> 17:02.120
Now, please leave.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.522
It's time for the entrée.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.062
Come on, let's go
ask my dad for help.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.296
I thought you two
were fighting.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.065
He's my best friend.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.868
He's the one person my whole
life who's never let me down.

17:16.870 --> 17:20.038
(moaning)

17:20.040 --> 17:22.907
It's... It's hard

17:22.909 --> 17:24.709
Because I'm a man,
you know?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.577
I love that you're a man.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.312
But it's just ever
since grace's mom died,

17:28.314 --> 17:30.048
I just haven't found...

17:30.050 --> 17:31.249
I haven't found the one.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.317
Yeah, grace's mom, yeah.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.053
I know what you mean.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.488
¶ the way he moved,
it was a sin ¶

17:37.490 --> 17:39.090
¶ so sweet and true... ¶

17:39.092 --> 17:40.825
Oh, my god,
is this "black velvet"?

17:40.827 --> 17:41.993
Oh, you know it.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.395
This is the most sensual song
ever written.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.065
We need to do this
right now!
Oh, okay...

17:47.067 --> 17:48.433
¶ black velvet... ¶

17:48.435 --> 17:50.001
It's just so unlike her.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.602
If you call zayday,
she's gonna call you back

17:51.604 --> 17:54.005
While you're
leaving a message.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.506
Hey, dad?

17:55.508 --> 17:56.541
I think he's home.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.176
I hear his '90s music playing.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.677
Oh, my god!

17:59.679 --> 18:01.712
(excited clamoring)

18:01.714 --> 18:02.947
¶ black velvet... ¶

18:02.949 --> 18:05.283
Go in... Another room.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.551
Dad?

18:06.553 --> 18:08.920
High, we were h-high-fiving.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.255
What are you doing?
I just saw her boobs.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.690
Hang on, I can explain.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.093
Your father and I
were on a salad date,

18:15.095 --> 18:17.361
And we just started talking...

18:17.363 --> 18:18.563
A "salad date"-- what is that?

18:18.565 --> 18:19.764
Is that, like, a thing?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.066
Oh, a salad date is,
it's like,

18:22.068 --> 18:24.735
It's more casual than dinner,

18:24.737 --> 18:27.138
But more formal than coffee.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.906
Sure. Um...

18:28.908 --> 18:31.275
I just wanted

18:31.277 --> 18:33.911
To come by and let you know
that zayday is still missing.

18:33.913 --> 18:34.946
Oh, no... Oh, no.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.380
Grace, that's terrible.

18:36.382 --> 18:37.148
We got to find her.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.149
I'll help.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.117
So will gigi.

18:39.119 --> 18:39.917
Mm-hmm.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.285
Yeah, yep.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.455
As soon as I find
my cavaricci's.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.757
Whose pants are these?
That's weird.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.960
They're in the kitchen.
I don't know why.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.496
Look, hey.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.098
I'm really...
I'm really sorry, honey.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.000
We should talk about this.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.468
Hey, dad, I'm cool, I promise.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.137
You know, you're a human being

18:59.139 --> 19:00.738
With feelings and needs, right?

19:00.740 --> 19:01.973
I get it.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.674
You know, and
I'm totally fine

19:03.676 --> 19:05.476
That you've moved on
from mom... Really.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.478
Um, but enough about me

19:07.480 --> 19:09.480
And my confusion
and sad dead feeling inside.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.283
We need to find zayday.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.952
Right, we should talk
to dean munsch about this.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.421
Yeah.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.599
And then I asked my dad to bail
me out and he's all like,

19:28.601 --> 19:30.134
"we have a big
stockholders meeting

19:30.136 --> 19:31.969
"coming up in a couple of weeks

19:31.971 --> 19:34.005
"and I'm about to endorse
ted cruz, so I'd rather not

19:34.007 --> 19:36.040
"do anything that could
get me bad press right now,

19:36.042 --> 19:37.808
Like being the father
of a murderer and stuff."

19:37.810 --> 19:40.945
And so he needs to pretend
that I don't exist...Again.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.181
It just really hurt my feelings.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.682
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
my so-called

19:44.684 --> 19:46.450
Friends are the ones
that turned me in

19:46.452 --> 19:48.352
So I'm just feeling, like,
super alone right now.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.854
Don't worry, chanel.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.190
We got your back.
Thank you, millie.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.991
Look, I don't know
if you remember this, but, uh,

19:53.993 --> 19:57.828
You sent me the most amazing
fake severed foot

19:57.830 --> 19:59.797
Filled with jelly beans
for chanel-o-ween

19:59.799 --> 20:02.166
Last year right before I killed
that gas station attendant.

20:02.168 --> 20:05.036
Man, I am your
biggest instagram fan!

20:05.038 --> 20:08.873
I-I just think you are
a style genius.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.041
Stop!
And I'm here
to tell you,

20:10.043 --> 20:12.476
Any friendships you make
on the inside

20:12.478 --> 20:14.645
Is the real kind.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.980
Thank you, guys.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.748
I will never be able
to repay you

20:17.750 --> 20:19.083
For the kindness
you've shown me in here.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.085
Besties for life, I say.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.086
Man:
Oberlin.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.988
Your bail's been posted.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.990
Later, losers.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.825
Uh, wha...?

20:29.362 --> 20:33.064
¶ set me free,
why don't you, babe? ¶

20:33.066 --> 20:36.300
¶ get out of my life,
why don't you, babe? ¶

20:40.773 --> 20:43.908
¶ but you keep me hanging on ¶

20:43.910 --> 20:45.243
I knew you'd bail me out.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.078
Well, technically,
my dad did.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.613
I told him college textbooks
are getting crazy expensive,

20:48.615 --> 20:51.449
So he wired me $300,000
no questions asked.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.051
Chanel #3, predatory lez,
you are true friends.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.953
I'm famished.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.622
I wouldn't mind stopping at
wendy's for some barbecue sauce

20:57.624 --> 21:00.091
To dip our cotton balls in
and then finding chanel #5.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.759
It's high time
for a little gd payback.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.034
Can I just say
what a relief it is

21:10.036 --> 21:12.703
To be able to share it with
somebody and not feel judged?

21:12.705 --> 21:14.538
You know, I mean,
all my girlfriends

21:14.540 --> 21:15.940
Are like, "that's immoral."

21:15.942 --> 21:17.475
"you should be
ashamed of yourself!"

21:17.477 --> 21:18.976
Ashamed?

21:18.978 --> 21:20.645
What the hell you
got to be ashamed for?

21:20.647 --> 21:22.246
You should be proud.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.481
A foxy lady your age

21:23.483 --> 21:26.083
Getting some sweet coed tail.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.052
I could've lost my job.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.421
And it wasn't even good,
you know?

21:30.423 --> 21:33.891
I mean, it lasted, like,
45 seconds, and the whole time,

21:33.893 --> 21:36.494
It just felt like I was getting
stabbed in the abdomen.

21:36.496 --> 21:40.231
Wait, hold on-- are we talking
about chad radwell here?

21:40.233 --> 21:42.933
Yeah.
Chad radwell?

21:42.935 --> 21:44.635
What you talking about?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.937
I slept with chad, too,

21:46.939 --> 21:48.272
And it was amazing!

21:48.274 --> 21:50.474
I tied him up and I kept
my uniform on

21:50.476 --> 21:52.310
And proceeded
to read him his rights.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.278
My favorite being:
"you got the right

21:54.280 --> 21:56.447
To remain sexy."

21:56.449 --> 21:57.848
(laughs)

21:57.850 --> 21:58.983
Give me some!

21:58.985 --> 22:00.117
You know he's sexy!

22:00.119 --> 22:02.787
(laughing)

22:02.789 --> 22:05.790
That was one of the best nights
of my life.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.092
Granted, when chad and I
get together,

22:08.094 --> 22:09.760
It's mostly about
the role-play.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.096
I mean, we go on for a while.

22:12.098 --> 22:15.633
But that's because we both do
extensive character research.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.969
So there's a surprising amount
of dialogue.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.004
Dean munsch?

22:20.006 --> 22:21.372
We need your help
with zayday.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.107
We don't know
who else to turn to.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.209
Well, I've already contacted

22:25.211 --> 22:27.511
The police department,
despite the fact

22:27.513 --> 22:28.946
That a person can't
be considered "missing"

22:28.948 --> 22:31.816
Until at least
72 hours has passed.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.017
She could be
dead by then.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.185
She could be dead now!

22:35.355 --> 22:36.887
I'm sorry.
That's morbid.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.189
But she could be.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.256
She probably is.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.360
Zayday williams ain't dead.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.794
I keep tellin' y'all--

22:43.796 --> 22:45.062
Zayday is the killer!

22:45.064 --> 22:46.163
No, that's insane.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.331
There is no way
she's the killer.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.200
Bitch had a chain saw

22:49.202 --> 22:51.502
In her room.
Yeah, well, if the
police can't help us,

22:51.504 --> 22:52.837
We gotta figure
something else out.

22:52.839 --> 22:53.904
I don't know, the fbi.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.539
A private investigator...

22:55.541 --> 22:57.908
I've already hired
an investigator.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.310
I placed a call

22:59.312 --> 23:01.011
To a company I trust,

23:01.013 --> 23:03.647
Secure enforcement solutions.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.082
Oh, good lord.
Yes.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.217
(chuckles)

23:06.219 --> 23:07.818
Denise hemphill

23:07.820 --> 23:09.420
Is gonna find zayday williams.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.989
And then I'm gonna throw her
in the slammer

23:11.991 --> 23:14.058
For murder in the first.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.026
Hold on. If she thinks
zayday's the killer,

23:16.028 --> 23:17.328
Which is absolutely
insane...

23:17.330 --> 23:19.330
Chain saw
under the bed.

23:19.332 --> 23:21.732
...Then she shouldn't be leading
the manhunt to find her!

23:21.734 --> 23:24.034
I would think that
that would make her

23:24.036 --> 23:26.237
Extra motivated to find her.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.439
Thank you.
Wes:
Well...

23:28.441 --> 23:29.774
I'll tell you this much:
Gigi and I

23:29.776 --> 23:31.075
Are going to do
everything we can

23:31.077 --> 23:32.676
To find her.
Right, honey?

23:32.678 --> 23:33.711
Right.

23:33.713 --> 23:36.414
What, are you two a couple now?

23:36.416 --> 23:37.515
Mm-hmm.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.849
Oh!

23:38.851 --> 23:40.284
(huffs) come on.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.619
We need to go find her.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.421
The sun sets
in an hour.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.622
Denise:
That's right.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.090
Halloween is upon us.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.159
And the devil is
gonna come a-runnin'.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.952
What the hell are you doing?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.787
Where's your mary todd lincoln
outfit, number five?

24:16.789 --> 24:19.990
There can't be two
jackie kennedys.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.560
You sold me down the river,
bitch.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.095
You lied and told munsch
that I killed ms. Bean.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.664
Well, you did kill ms. Bean,

24:26.666 --> 24:27.798
But I wouldn't rat you
out to anyone!

24:27.800 --> 24:29.500
Liar!
(gasps)

24:29.502 --> 24:31.268
Hester told me everything.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.337
And then number five said
she was gonna turn you in,

24:33.339 --> 24:34.905
She just didn't know
who to tell first,

24:34.907 --> 24:36.674
Dean munsch
or the cops.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.075
Isn't that right,
jennifer?

24:38.077 --> 24:40.177
And then she said
once you were behind bars,

24:40.179 --> 24:41.946
She was going
to spread a rumor

24:41.948 --> 24:43.514
That the only reason
you're skinny

24:43.516 --> 24:45.282
Is because your parents
stole your kidneys

24:45.284 --> 24:47.818
Just like gary
coleman's did.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.020
Wait, gary coleman's parents
stole his kidneys?

24:50.022 --> 24:51.522
I would never say that,

24:51.524 --> 24:52.857
Because I'm pretty sure
that never even happened.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.859
Well, why does it feel so true?

24:54.861 --> 24:56.093
And why does ratting me out

24:56.095 --> 24:58.095
Sound like exactly
something you would do?

24:58.097 --> 24:59.964
Because hester's
trying to frame me, obviously!

24:59.966 --> 25:02.867
Her name is chanel #6,
chanel #5.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.636
You know,

25:05.638 --> 25:07.471
I've never thought of myself
as a killer,

25:07.473 --> 25:09.039
But I am seriously considering

25:09.041 --> 25:11.342
Ramming this pick into
the back of your eye socket.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.377
Or, you can elect

25:13.379 --> 25:16.347
A different punishment.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.982
Go get that pumpkin patch ready.
But there's a curfew
tonight, okay?

25:17.984 --> 25:20.217
The killer is obviously going
to be out.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.019
Maybe you'll get
your head sawed off.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.388
I can't think of a better
chanel-o-ween treat than that.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.825
You're a psychopath, chanel.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.126
I'm not doing it.

25:29.128 --> 25:32.229
Interesting.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.998
Well, fine, then.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.634
I guess I'll just have
to resort to plan "b."

25:36.636 --> 25:39.036
I'll show roger and dodger
video proof

25:39.038 --> 25:40.638
That their hot new girlfriend

25:40.640 --> 25:42.907
Regularly rubs it out
in her room

25:42.909 --> 25:44.542
While watching
<i>dora the explorer.</i>

25:44.544 --> 25:46.043
You have cameras in my room?

25:46.045 --> 25:49.813
I have eyes everywhere, bitch.
(pick clatters to floor)

25:49.815 --> 25:52.249
The name of my future perfume
is revenge.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.585
Remember... I want candles

25:54.587 --> 25:56.554
In every jack-o'-lantern!

26:03.095 --> 26:04.495
Grace:
Okay. This is a map of town.

26:04.497 --> 26:06.230
This is where zayday
was last seen.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.098
I say we fan out in a radius
around this point

26:08.100 --> 26:09.900
And go door to door,
asking if anyone's seen her.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.102
Gigi:
Well, buckle up,
'cause I've got one.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.071
Yeah.
You ever heard of glaciers?

26:14.073 --> 26:17.675
When the glaciers melted
in the last ice age,

26:17.677 --> 26:19.410
They left several
different soil types

26:19.412 --> 26:20.711
Scattered
about the region.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.046
Now, I happen to know

26:22.048 --> 26:23.714
That the house on shady lane,

26:23.716 --> 26:25.549
Where zayday was last seen,

26:25.551 --> 26:28.285
Had a red clay substrate

26:28.287 --> 26:29.954
In both the front and back yard

26:29.956 --> 26:31.288
And poor drainage.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.725
How is that something
you just happen to know?

26:34.727 --> 26:37.561
Look, if zayday was kidnapped
outside the house

26:37.563 --> 26:39.363
And put up any kind of struggle,

26:39.365 --> 26:42.466
There would be wet clay
all over the getaway car.

26:42.468 --> 26:44.234
Okay? And the kidnapper

26:44.236 --> 26:46.103
Would probably want
to get rid of that,

26:46.105 --> 26:49.306
So I'm thinking we should go
to every local car wash

26:49.308 --> 26:52.476
And ask them
if they've had any customers

26:52.478 --> 26:54.912
With weird red stains
in their trunk.

26:54.914 --> 26:58.215
That is stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
Pete:
Wait, wait.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.917
Zayday's grandmother.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.585
Have you...
Have you tried calling her?

27:01.587 --> 27:02.920
No, but maybe
she knows something.

27:02.922 --> 27:03.921
Last week zayday called her
from my phone

27:03.923 --> 27:05.222
Because her phone died.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.157
(gasps)
hold on! That's it!

27:07.159 --> 27:09.627
"find my device."
it's an app.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.228
Every smartphone
has a gps in it.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.397
Even if it's dead, it can still
tell us where it is.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.399
We just have to log
into her account.
Pete: Got it.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.734
What's the password?

27:16.736 --> 27:18.335
Grace:
Ah, crap! Uh...

27:18.337 --> 27:20.004
God, I feel like
I should know this.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.640
Uh, zee, I can't...

27:22.642 --> 27:24.408
I just can't eat
any more of these.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.809
You don't love oakland nachos?

27:25.811 --> 27:26.910
They're amazing!

27:26.912 --> 27:28.345
I mean, I love 'em so much,

27:28.347 --> 27:29.847
They're my password
to everything.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.817
Oakland nachos! Her password is
"oakland nachos."

27:33.819 --> 27:35.819
Okay, it's searching.
There it is.
We've got an address!

27:35.821 --> 27:37.354
1283 north haverbrook court.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.690
All right, boom.
Y'all come and help me

27:39.692 --> 27:40.958
Load up the car.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.960
I got all manner
of spy gear needed

27:42.962 --> 27:45.029
To catch that murdering

27:45.031 --> 27:46.430
Zayday williams.

27:46.432 --> 27:47.831
Come on!

27:49.969 --> 27:51.435
Hey, grace?
Can-can we talk

27:51.437 --> 27:53.537
For two seconds?

27:53.539 --> 27:55.439
Look, I-I'm sorry
that you're upset

27:55.441 --> 27:56.874
And you saw...

27:56.876 --> 27:58.942
I'm fine, dad,

27:58.944 --> 28:02.179
I just think it's weird.
You know?

28:02.181 --> 28:04.214
We tell each other everything,

28:04.216 --> 28:06.450
And you couldn't
give me a heads-up

28:06.452 --> 28:09.186
That the first person
you choose to date

28:09.188 --> 28:11.822
Is a) somebody I know

28:11.824 --> 28:14.058
And b)...

28:14.060 --> 28:16.727
(whispering):
Obviously
mentally disturbed.

28:16.729 --> 28:19.263
Probably...
Shoot, guys, I can hear you.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.067
Oh, my god, what is going on?

28:23.069 --> 28:24.802
Why are y'all
still in here?

28:24.804 --> 28:26.070
This ain't<i> the marriage ref!</i>

28:26.072 --> 28:27.871
This ain't<i> judge joe brown.</i>

28:27.873 --> 28:29.573
We ain't on the<i> maury show!</i>

28:29.575 --> 28:31.041
We ain't standin' in line

28:31.043 --> 28:32.509
Trying to get tickets
to<i> dr. Phil!</i>

28:32.511 --> 28:34.478
I am not steve harvey, people,

28:34.480 --> 28:36.313
And this ain't the<i> family feud!</i>

28:36.315 --> 28:38.515
I'm tryin' to catch a killer.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.718
Now, come on!
Help me get the spy gear

28:40.720 --> 28:42.886
In the car! Damn!

28:42.888 --> 28:44.488
¶ ¶

28:47.526 --> 28:48.992
Honestly, chanel #5,

28:48.994 --> 28:50.661
You have nothing
to be afraid of.

28:50.663 --> 28:53.897
Seriously. We fought
the red devil before.

28:53.899 --> 28:54.998
And only one of us

28:55.000 --> 28:56.433
Got his arms sawed off,
so, I mean...

28:56.435 --> 28:58.102
Thanks, guys.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.837
Look, let's just light
all these jack-o'-lanterns

28:59.839 --> 29:02.005
And then get the hell
out of here.
All right.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.953
(whispering):
Dodger...

29:15.955 --> 29:17.154
Let's go in there.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.175
(screams)

29:42.114 --> 29:44.081
(screams)

29:44.083 --> 29:46.717
Please help me!
Chanel #5,
are you okay?

29:46.719 --> 29:48.051
It's the red devil!
Let's bash his car!
No!

29:48.053 --> 29:50.020
First, let's protect
chanel #5!

29:56.962 --> 29:59.797
(panting)

30:09.608 --> 30:11.675
(chanel #5 panting)

30:11.677 --> 30:12.943
Which way?

30:12.945 --> 30:14.912
This way.
No, it's this way.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.014
I promise.
How can you promise?

30:17.016 --> 30:18.982
We're in a maze, you don't know
where you're going!

30:18.984 --> 30:20.150
Ah!

30:21.587 --> 30:22.953
Roger:
<i>Brother against brother.</i>

30:22.955 --> 30:24.021
I always knew
it would come to this.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.355
What are you doing?

30:25.357 --> 30:26.690
The killer is right behind us.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.325
We have to go!

30:28.327 --> 30:30.093
No, chanel #5.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.962
You need to pick one of us.
Forever. Right now.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.797
What? Why?

30:33.799 --> 30:34.932
And why are
we doing this right now?

30:34.934 --> 30:36.700
Roger:
<i>He's right, chanel #5.</i>

30:36.702 --> 30:38.702
<i>Spit-roasting you</i>
<i>caused my brother and I</i>

30:38.704 --> 30:39.770
To fall in love with you.

30:39.772 --> 30:40.938
Neither of us
are content

30:40.940 --> 30:41.939
With sharing
you anymore.

30:41.941 --> 30:42.973
That's right, chanel #5.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.675
You need to choose one of us.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.109
And if you choose my brother,
you're choosing

30:46.111 --> 30:47.711
His side of the eiffel tower
forevermore.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.012
Why are we doing this right now?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.013
Choose,
number five.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.815
Pick a side of the eiffel tower.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.050
Fine, roger!

30:53.052 --> 30:54.218
You.
I'm coming with you.

30:55.821 --> 30:56.954
So be it.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.032
Our footprints.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.167
In the snow!

31:10.169 --> 31:12.135
We're leaving footprints
in the snow.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.338
The red devil's just going
to follow the trail.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.906
Just walk backwards
in our footsteps

31:15.908 --> 31:17.875
And we'll throw him off.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.211
In your own footsteps.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.746
Okay.

31:22.748 --> 31:23.881
I've got to warn
dodger, though.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.149
Shh!

31:26.151 --> 31:27.751
Roger:
Dodger!

31:29.488 --> 31:30.988
Watch out for your footprints!

31:30.990 --> 31:32.256
Watch out for them how?

31:32.258 --> 31:34.191
Roger:
Be sure to walk backwards

31:34.193 --> 31:35.492
So the devil won't find you!

31:35.494 --> 31:36.827
Oh, I get it.

31:36.829 --> 31:38.161
Thanks, roger!

32:08.460 --> 32:09.927
(dodger screaming)

32:09.929 --> 32:12.429
Dodger:
Oh, god!

32:12.431 --> 32:15.766
Help me! Oh, god, help!
This way.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.367
Dodger!
No, come on!

32:17.369 --> 32:19.536
We have to go!
(dodger continues screaming)

32:31.884 --> 32:34.117
Elderly woman:
I rented my cellar
to a dream tenant.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.653
I rarely see him.

32:36.655 --> 32:37.955
They pay the rent

32:37.957 --> 32:39.756
On time,

32:39.758 --> 32:41.291
In cash

32:41.293 --> 32:42.926
Every month.

32:42.928 --> 32:45.896
Okay, everybody
take a taser.
Yeah.

32:45.898 --> 32:48.832
Also got some compasses
and some decoder rings.

32:48.834 --> 32:49.900
What about flashlights?

32:49.902 --> 32:51.134
Aw, crap!

32:51.136 --> 32:52.769
I forgot the flashlights!

32:52.771 --> 32:53.937
Grace, when we get down there,

32:53.939 --> 32:56.273
You stay close to me, all right?

32:56.275 --> 32:57.908
What am I supposed
to do with this?

32:57.910 --> 33:00.143
Not a damn thing,
darling little old lady.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.212
What's wrong
with you?

33:10.522 --> 33:12.522
I think we need
to split up into teams.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.157
Okay, I'll go with denise.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.926
You guys go right
and we'll keep to the left.

33:15.928 --> 33:18.695
If anybody gets scurred,
scream real loud,

33:18.697 --> 33:20.397
And I will come a-runnin'.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.946
(pete and wes shout)

33:37.349 --> 33:39.416
This is so creepy.

33:48.961 --> 33:51.028
Not as creepy as that.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.899
Wes:
What the hell is this place?

34:18.023 --> 34:20.257
(metal clangs)

34:20.259 --> 34:21.691
(gasps)

34:21.693 --> 34:22.893
Oh, my god.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.094
Oh, my god, zayday!

34:24.096 --> 34:25.595
Zayday!

34:43.515 --> 34:45.082
Denise:
Uh-uh.

34:45.084 --> 34:47.284
It smell like booty in here.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.052
Yeah.

34:49.054 --> 34:51.088
I'm getting a nervous
feeling in my stomach.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.457
I might start farting.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.592
If I cut some, you promise
not to tell anyone?

34:55.594 --> 34:59.096
I... No, I won't tell anyone.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.882
Geez.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.651
Grace:
Zayday!

35:21.653 --> 35:22.919
It's empty.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.788
Zayday isn't down there.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.090
(they shout)

35:27.092 --> 35:29.092
Denise: (shouts)
the lights went out.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.161
(gasps)

36:02.127 --> 36:04.127
(saw buzzes)

36:04.129 --> 36:05.128
(screams)

36:05.130 --> 36:07.597
Ow! Oh, my boob!

36:13.038 --> 36:15.605
You... You tased
the red devil.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.541
Grace: Denise!
Denise, where are you?

36:17.543 --> 36:19.342
Stay where you are!

36:19.344 --> 36:20.844
I'll come and get you!

36:20.846 --> 36:22.145
I'll be right back.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.980
Don't... Don't
go nowhere.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.115
All:
Over here!

36:28.620 --> 36:30.120
Ooh, I got to catch my breath.

36:30.122 --> 36:31.121
What's happened?
What's going on?

36:31.123 --> 36:32.455
Hold on.

36:34.993 --> 36:35.992
Ooh, this is nice.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.327
Um...

36:37.329 --> 36:39.329
Gigi tased the red devil.

36:39.331 --> 36:43.333
Well, first I accidentally tased
gigi right in the boobs.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.202
That had to hurt.

36:45.204 --> 36:46.736
But she didn't let that
stop her, uh-uh.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.038
She got that taser and bop!

36:48.040 --> 36:51.341
She hit the red devil
right in the throat.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.842
Why are we still standing here?

36:52.844 --> 36:53.843
Come on!
Let's go.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.045
This way!

36:55.047 --> 36:56.580
What happened?

36:56.582 --> 36:58.982
Where'd the red devil go?

36:58.984 --> 37:00.183
He got away.

37:00.185 --> 37:01.518
Wes:
Are you okay?

37:01.520 --> 37:02.986
Yeah, he just jumped up

37:02.988 --> 37:04.087
And hit me across
the head with a bat

37:04.089 --> 37:05.488
And then ran up the chute.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.991
Crap! I'm-a get
that murdering bitch.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.259
No, call the police.

37:09.261 --> 37:10.760
Tell them we found
the red devil's lair.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.128
Wes: Hey, gracie,
look, I got it.

37:14.099 --> 37:15.899
Grace: Gigi, I-I can't
believe you did that.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.034
You risked your life for us.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.536
Oh, no, I didn't.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.338
I mean, I did,
and it hurt a lot.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.241
But, you know,
I care about you girls.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.744
No, no, no-no, it's
1283<i> north</i> haverbrook lane.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.045
North.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.814
Yes, I actually do have
the coordinates.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.619
I guess I knew the day
was always gonna come

37:35.621 --> 37:37.621
When my dad met somebody,

37:37.623 --> 37:41.057
And now I'm actually glad
that that somebody is you.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.293
Aw, that's so sweet.

37:43.295 --> 37:46.896
Guys, she's saying...

37:46.898 --> 37:50.867
Really sweet stepdaughter-
stepmother moment.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.369
It's really beautiful.

37:52.371 --> 37:56.273
I ran all around
this house real fast.

37:56.275 --> 37:59.042
And the red devil
is nowhere to be found.

37:59.044 --> 38:00.543
Uh, uh, wait a minute.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.912
Neither is zayday williams.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.814
Coincidence?

38:06.218 --> 38:08.184
I think not.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.995
Chanel: Okay, ho-bags,
tonight we cast our votes

38:18.997 --> 38:20.697
For the next president
of kappa house.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.968
Don't grace and zayday need
to be here for us to vote?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.136
According to the
kappa kappa bylaws

38:26.138 --> 38:28.905
Written over 175 years ago

38:28.907 --> 38:30.640
Just before the war of
northern aggression,

38:30.642 --> 38:32.442
The president can call
for an election

38:32.444 --> 38:34.077
At any time and for any reason.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.512
It looks like you just
crossed some stuff out

38:35.514 --> 38:37.147
And wrote that
in in marker.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.519
This has been the worst
night of my life.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.288
My pumpkin patch was canceled
because one of those idiot twins

38:45.290 --> 38:48.692
Decided he'd rather get killed
than keep boning number five...

38:48.694 --> 38:49.959
Okay, can we talk about
that for a second?

38:49.961 --> 38:51.761
Because it just happened
a few hours ago,

38:51.763 --> 38:53.763
And I'm still
really traumatized.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.965
What about me?
I have to live with the fact

38:55.967 --> 38:57.967
That no one got to see
how awesome my maze was

38:57.969 --> 38:59.836
And that I've done nothing
to stop the spread

38:59.838 --> 39:01.971
Of black hairy
tongue disease.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.473
I need some cheering up
right now.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.941
And if that means
rigging an election

39:04.943 --> 39:06.176
So that I can
be president again,

39:06.178 --> 39:07.677
I expect you all
to be my friends

39:07.679 --> 39:08.945
And accept that.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.948
Everybody, grab two marbles.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.717
You drop a white marble
in the box for me

39:13.719 --> 39:15.085
And a black one for zayday.

39:17.222 --> 39:18.521
Let the voting begin.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.056
Not so fast.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.024
You're alive.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.826
Damn straight, I'm alive.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.894
Can't be the next president
of this joint if I'm dead.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.566
Excuse me, darling,
I'm exhausted.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.568
Thank you.

39:31.570 --> 39:34.471
May I have a diet coke,
please? On the rocks.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.039
Actually, make it regular--
I've been through a lot.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.707
Is grace with you? No.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.909
Good, then we can still vote.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.412
Wait, we need to hear
what happened to you.

39:42.414 --> 39:45.915
The red devil kidnapped me
and took me to his evil lair.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.884
He kept me in a pit.
Did he dig the pit himself?

39:47.886 --> 39:50.053
How should I know?
Just wondering where you find
a house with a pit.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.588
The market for them
would be pretty limited.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.223
Hester: Did you escape,
or did you kill him?

39:53.225 --> 39:55.024
Because if you did,
you need to tell us

39:55.026 --> 39:57.026
All of the details,

39:57.028 --> 39:58.661
Including what
his eyes looked like

39:58.663 --> 39:59.662
When he took his last breath.

39:59.664 --> 40:00.897
They say in that moment,

40:00.899 --> 40:02.399
The soul tells
all of its secrets.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.501
No, they don't--
no one says that.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.903
Yeah, they do.
This story is boring

40:06.905 --> 40:08.204
Unless it involves
him torturing you.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.006
He didn't do anything
to me at all.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.675
Except send me down little
treats in a basket.

40:12.677 --> 40:14.444
Uh, a nintendo game,
kiehl's products.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.079
It was actually
quite lovely.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.213
Then, suddenly,

40:17.215 --> 40:19.215
<i>A ladder came down.</i>

40:19.217 --> 40:23.787
<i>I climbed up, and what I saw</i>
<i>made my blood run cold.</i>

40:45.143 --> 40:47.210
Oakland nachos?

40:55.387 --> 40:57.387
Huh.

40:57.389 --> 40:59.389
I get it.

40:59.391 --> 41:01.458
You like the chocolate
swirl, don't you?

41:01.460 --> 41:05.895
I've always had a
thing for bad boys.

41:05.897 --> 41:06.963
(chuckles)

41:06.965 --> 41:08.398
But I hate
little bitches

41:08.400 --> 41:10.066
That kill my friends!

41:13.972 --> 41:16.139
Wait a second, the red devil
is in love with you?

41:16.141 --> 41:18.141
Okay, that is so unfair,

41:18.143 --> 41:19.943
Because it literally took me,
like, three years here

41:19.945 --> 41:21.478
For a guy to even look at me.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.812
Wait, if he ran
here from there,

41:22.814 --> 41:23.913
Then you know
where he lives.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.148
We need to call
the police.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.749
No, kitty puncher,
that can wait.

41:26.751 --> 41:28.017
We need to vote now
before grace shows up

41:28.019 --> 41:29.853
And makes it harder
for me to win.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.488
We are all very impressed

41:31.490 --> 41:32.922
By your alleged escape
from the red devil.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.158
I, for one, think
we should take

41:35.160 --> 41:36.960
This tall tale into account
when we vote.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.361
I don't believe
a word of it,

41:38.363 --> 41:40.363
And I would have
a really hard time

41:40.365 --> 41:41.965
Casting my vote for a liar.
(door closes)

41:41.967 --> 41:42.999
She's telling the truth.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.033
I was there.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.368
I saw the pit
and everything.

41:45.370 --> 41:47.937
My god, zayday,
I am so glad you're okay.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.373
We went to go rescue you,
but you'd already escaped.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.875
Aw, thanks for trying,

41:51.877 --> 41:53.009
But you know you
shouldn't worry about me.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.010
I'm like black<i> die hard.</i>

41:54.012 --> 41:55.812
Ugh, fine, you didn't lie--

41:55.814 --> 41:57.814
Or you're both lying--
I don't care.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.049
I can't believe deaf taylor
swift and number two are dead

42:00.051 --> 42:01.684
And you two are
still alive.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.486
Now, if you're done,
grab some marbles.

42:03.488 --> 42:05.355
It's time to vote.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.727
¶ ¶

42:42.360 --> 42:44.427
Gigi:
You're late.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.431
That got way out of hand.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.668
He's got to go.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.469
Do you understand me?

42:56.575 --> 42:59.576
Good, take care of it.

42:59.578 --> 43:01.678
Now, if you'll excuse me,

43:01.680 --> 43:07.917
I've got a salad date
with a very special someone.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.687
