01:03.749 --> 01:05.650
<i>When the court officer
smiled at me</i>

01:05.652 --> 01:08.953
<i>on the morning of trial,
I knew I was fucked.</i>

01:08.955 --> 01:11.789
<i>They weren't taking bets
on this one.</i>

01:11.791 --> 01:13.424
<i>Mike had killed his father,</i>

01:13.426 --> 01:15.326
<i>Boone Lassiter,</i>

01:15.328 --> 01:17.795
<i>left his handprint on the knife,</i>

01:17.797 --> 01:19.163
<i>confessed.</i>

01:43.822 --> 01:46.691
<i>Half my cases
had evidence this bad.</i>

01:46.693 --> 01:47.992
<i>I just pled them out,</i>

01:47.994 --> 01:50.327
<i>got manslaughter and moved on,</i>

01:50.329 --> 01:54.098
<i>but this was Mike,
and I'd known him all his life.</i>

01:54.100 --> 01:56.233
<i>He was going to college
and probably law school,</i>

01:56.235 --> 01:58.335
<i>and I doubted his mother
could survive him</i>

01:58.337 --> 02:01.105
<i>going to the penitentiary.</i>

03:22.855 --> 03:25.189
<i>But I knew Boone, I had that,</i>

03:25.191 --> 03:27.391
<i>and I knew enough about
the Lassiter household</i>

03:27.393 --> 03:29.059
<i>to know that Mike had a defense,</i>

03:29.061 --> 03:31.562
<i>if he would just talk to me.</i>

03:56.955 --> 04:00.024
- Jim.
- Good Morning.

04:00.026 --> 04:01.926
Flyin' solo on this one?

04:21.613 --> 04:24.381
<i>Section 34 of the judicial
district court</i>

04:24.383 --> 04:25.916
<i>of the state of Louisiana</i>

04:25.918 --> 04:26.917
<i>in and for the parish of
St. Bernard</i>

04:26.919 --> 04:28.586
<i>is now in session.</i>

04:28.588 --> 04:30.955
<i>The honorable judge
Robichaux is presiding.</i>

04:30.957 --> 04:32.923
<i>Order and silence are commanded.</i>

04:32.925 --> 04:36.026
God save the state of
Louisiana and this court.

04:36.028 --> 04:37.628
All rise,

04:37.630 --> 04:39.864
<i>for the honorable
Edouard Robichaux.</i>

04:48.874 --> 04:50.074
Bring 'em in.

04:58.416 --> 04:59.550
<i>Good morning, jury.</i>

05:01.553 --> 05:03.888
Please be seated.

05:03.890 --> 05:05.056
<i>The court will come to order</i>

05:05.058 --> 05:09.159
<i>in the matter of the state of
Louisiana versus Michael Lassiter,</i>

05:09.161 --> 05:11.161
<i>on the charge
of first-degree murder.</i>

05:11.163 --> 05:12.897
Jury, you should know
the defendant

05:12.899 --> 05:14.298
is still a minor...

05:14.300 --> 05:16.934
<i>Six weeks shy of his
17th birthday.</i>

05:16.936 --> 05:19.236
<i>But due to the seriousness
of the charges,</i>

05:19.238 --> 05:21.105
<i>the case was transferred
to this court,</i>

05:21.107 --> 05:24.041
where he is being tried
as an adult.

05:24.043 --> 05:25.409
<i>Counselors.</i>

05:30.482 --> 05:33.651
Gentlemen, you both have
toiled in my courtroom before,

05:33.653 --> 05:36.120
so you know how
I appreciate a swift trial.

05:36.122 --> 05:37.288
Yes, sir.

05:42.327 --> 05:44.128
<i>Good morning.</i>

05:44.130 --> 05:46.997
Thank you for your service.

05:46.999 --> 05:50.334
The case before you today
is a simple one,

05:50.336 --> 05:52.703
a simple case of patricide.

05:52.705 --> 05:55.339
Now, that's the killing
of one's father.

05:55.341 --> 05:58.208
The defendant is the young
man that you see over there,

05:58.210 --> 06:01.445
<i>Mike Lassiter.</i>

06:01.447 --> 06:02.947
<i>He's a senior at Newman.</i>

06:02.949 --> 06:04.548
He's a good student,

06:04.550 --> 06:07.685
co-captain of
the debate team.

06:07.687 --> 06:10.220
This past February, however,

06:10.222 --> 06:11.622
on a Tuesday afternoon,

06:11.624 --> 06:13.724
Mike took a knife,

06:13.726 --> 06:16.493
and he stabbed his father,
Boone Lassiter,

06:16.495 --> 06:18.095
right here.

06:20.131 --> 06:22.599
Not by accident,

06:22.601 --> 06:25.569
not in self-defense.

06:25.571 --> 06:27.738
He did it out of anger.

06:27.740 --> 06:31.542
<i>With premeditation
and malicious intent,</i>

06:31.544 --> 06:34.345
<i>he murdered his father.</i>

06:34.347 --> 06:38.582
<i>We'll prove this beyond
a reasonable doubt.</i>

06:38.584 --> 06:41.518
<i>Now, you may hear,
from the other side,</i>

06:41.520 --> 06:44.655
<i>that the victim, Mike's dad,</i>

06:44.657 --> 06:46.657
<i>wasn't such a good guy,</i>

06:46.659 --> 06:48.759
that he was tough on his son,

06:48.761 --> 06:51.528
that he bullied him.

06:51.530 --> 06:54.264
But Boone Lassiter
isn't on trial here

06:54.266 --> 06:56.200
for father of the year.

06:56.202 --> 07:00.404
<i>He may not have been
the best dad,</i>

07:00.406 --> 07:03.273
<i>but the evidence will show
he wasn't the worst.</i>

07:03.275 --> 07:05.709
You want me to put you down?

07:05.711 --> 07:09.046
<i>Plenty of people grow up
without the best dads.</i>

07:09.048 --> 07:10.581
- There!
- Aah!

07:10.583 --> 07:13.550
<i>It doesn't give anyone
the right to murder.</i>

07:13.552 --> 07:16.153
Aah!

07:16.155 --> 07:18.455
<i>Therefore, at the conclusion
of this case,</i>

07:18.457 --> 07:19.556
<i>I'll ask you</i>

07:19.558 --> 07:23.427
to return a verdict of guilty

07:23.429 --> 07:25.429
of murder in the first degree.

07:25.431 --> 07:28.532
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- If you don't talk to me,

07:28.534 --> 07:31.068
I have to waive my opening.

07:32.704 --> 07:34.571
<i>Counselor?</i>

07:37.142 --> 07:38.308
Your honor,

07:38.310 --> 07:40.310
the defense reserves its right

07:40.312 --> 07:42.079
to an opening statement

07:42.081 --> 07:45.349
until after the prosecution
presents its case.

07:45.351 --> 07:48.318
Well, we are speeding along.

07:49.487 --> 07:50.687
Your first witness ready?

07:54.325 --> 07:56.260
Can you see if
Angela Morley's out there?

08:04.402 --> 08:06.103
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,</i>

08:06.105 --> 08:07.771
<i>and nothing but the truth,
so help you god?</i>

08:07.773 --> 08:09.540
<i>I do.</i>

08:09.542 --> 08:10.607
<i>Your name, please.</i>

08:10.609 --> 08:12.676
Angela Morley.

08:12.678 --> 08:15.512
- <i>And your occupation?</i>
- Flight attendant for deluxe charter.

08:15.514 --> 08:18.248
- And deluxe is?
- A private airline.

08:18.250 --> 08:21.852
People buy timeshares and
we fly them all over the world.

08:21.854 --> 08:24.588
- <i>Affluent people?</i>
- Yes, very.

08:24.590 --> 08:26.623
<i>The victim, the deceased,</i>

08:26.625 --> 08:29.193
<i>Mr. Boone Lassiter,
he was one of these people.</i>

08:29.195 --> 08:30.594
<i>Yes.</i>

08:30.596 --> 08:32.863
<i>And were you always
on his flights?</i>

08:32.865 --> 08:35.499
Most of them. He'd request me.

08:35.501 --> 08:37.768
And when did he last
fly with you?

08:37.770 --> 08:40.370
The last week of January,

08:40.371 --> 08:42.438
to la and back
with his son Mike,

08:42.441 --> 08:44.374
and then round trip to Dallas.

08:44.376 --> 08:46.376
<i>And what was
the purpose of these trips,</i>

08:46.378 --> 08:48.245
<i>if you remember?</i>

08:48.247 --> 08:50.514
The second, Dallas,
was business.

08:50.516 --> 08:53.717
The first was
to take Mike, his son,

08:53.719 --> 08:55.385
to look at colleges...

08:55.387 --> 08:57.521
<i>UCLA and Stanford.</i>

08:57.523 --> 09:00.357
<i>We were supposed to go up
to Oregon to see, I think,</i>

09:00.359 --> 09:02.793
<i>Reed, but they decided
to come home instead.</i>

09:02.795 --> 09:04.828
Listen.

09:04.830 --> 09:06.730
It's your call,

09:06.732 --> 09:09.233
but Stanford is one
of the top schools in the country

09:09.235 --> 09:11.368
and you got in early.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.637
I mean, look,
I'm happy to go to Reed,

09:13.639 --> 09:15.405
check it out, but...

09:15.407 --> 09:17.641
<i>It's weird.</i>

09:17.643 --> 09:20.410
<i>Maybe we should just declare
victory and head home early, huh?</i>

09:21.446 --> 09:23.280
Surprise your mom?

09:23.282 --> 09:24.815
<i>And how would you characterize</i>

09:24.817 --> 09:27.151
<i>the relationship between
father and son,</i>

09:27.153 --> 09:29.620
<i>between Boone and Mike?</i>

09:29.622 --> 09:32.556
The trip home got kind of tense.

09:32.558 --> 09:34.591
Mike seemed like
a typical teenager,

09:34.593 --> 09:37.728
sullen with a little attitude.

09:37.729 --> 09:39.563
Listen, we're gonna skip Portland
and head back.

09:39.565 --> 09:41.165
- Tell the guys for me, will you?
- Okay.

09:46.704 --> 09:49.439
You think you're old enough
to handle a piece of ass like that?

09:53.178 --> 09:55.379
<i>You don't know
why Mike was sullen.</i>

09:55.381 --> 09:56.847
No.

09:56.849 --> 09:58.415
Thank you.

10:00.451 --> 10:01.785
<i>Ms. Morley.</i>

10:01.787 --> 10:04.821
I've never been
on a private plane.

10:04.823 --> 10:06.490
Help me out here.

10:06.492 --> 10:09.593
The customer can bring
whoever he wants with him.

10:09.595 --> 10:11.461
Yes.

10:11.463 --> 10:13.463
Mr. Lassiter would do that
sometimes.

10:13.465 --> 10:15.232
Of course.

10:15.234 --> 10:17.334
- <i>Men and women.</i>
- Sure.

10:17.336 --> 10:18.835
Other lawyers, mostly.

10:18.837 --> 10:20.871
And on the trip to Los Angeles,

10:20.873 --> 10:23.607
he brought his son.

10:23.609 --> 10:25.209
<i>Yes.</i>

10:25.211 --> 10:27.678
Yours is a service
industry, right?

10:27.680 --> 10:28.879
Yes.

10:28.881 --> 10:30.280
And it's competitive.

10:30.282 --> 10:31.848
Very.

10:31.850 --> 10:34.751
<i>So you have to provide
good service.</i>

10:34.753 --> 10:36.753
Naturally.

10:36.755 --> 10:39.356
Did you like servicing
Mr. Lassiter?

10:39.358 --> 10:41.391
Pardon me?

10:41.393 --> 10:43.594
<i>I'm asking if
he was a good client.</i>

10:45.296 --> 10:47.564
Yes.

10:47.566 --> 10:50.300
He was professional, but fun,

10:50.302 --> 10:51.535
pleasant to be around.

10:51.537 --> 10:53.437
<i>Ms. Morley,</i>

10:53.439 --> 10:55.772
<i>when Mr. Lassiter brought
a woman,</i>

10:55.774 --> 11:00.377
or women with him on the plane,

11:00.379 --> 11:03.380
did you ever leave
their names off the manifest?

11:03.382 --> 11:05.415
<i>Objection, your honor.</i>

11:05.417 --> 11:07.951
<i>Women on the manifest?
How is this relevant?</i>

11:07.953 --> 11:09.519
Your honor.

11:12.257 --> 11:14.491
<i>Do you have a proffer
of evidence on this, Mr. Ramsey?</i>

11:14.493 --> 11:16.660
- Your honor...
- Do you or do you not

11:16.662 --> 11:17.928
have evidence for this court?

11:17.930 --> 11:19.663
Not at this time.

11:19.665 --> 11:22.799
<i>You're fishing. I'll allow it.</i>

11:25.604 --> 11:27.337
<i>Now, step back.</i>

11:27.339 --> 11:28.939
You may answer the question.

11:32.410 --> 11:33.977
It would be against the law

11:33.979 --> 11:37.414
to omit passengers
from the manifest, so, no,

11:37.416 --> 11:39.383
of course they never did that.

11:43.955 --> 11:46.456
No further questions.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.725
<i>You picked up
Mr. Lassiter and his son</i>

11:48.727 --> 11:49.926
<i>at the lakefront airport.</i>

11:49.928 --> 11:51.428
That's correct, around 4:00.

11:54.633 --> 11:56.400
<i>And the next morning,
7:00 A.M.,</i>

11:56.402 --> 11:57.734
<i>you drove
Mr. Lassiter again.</i>

11:57.736 --> 11:59.436
That's correct,
straight to the airport.

11:59.438 --> 12:00.971
Was there anything unusual?

12:00.973 --> 12:02.973
No, nothing at all.

12:05.577 --> 12:07.844
<i>When he returned,
two days later,</i>

12:07.846 --> 12:09.846
on the evening of the murder,

12:09.848 --> 12:11.548
you again dropped
him at his home.

12:11.550 --> 12:14.651
<i>That's correct.</i>

12:14.653 --> 12:17.521
<i>Did you notice anything unusual?</i>

12:17.523 --> 12:19.456
No, nothing.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.992
<i>Anything or anyone
out of the ordinary?</i>

12:21.994 --> 12:23.560
No one.

12:24.829 --> 12:26.430
Thank you.

12:26.432 --> 12:27.764
Nothing further, your honor.

12:33.538 --> 12:35.572
Did you ever pick up women
for Mr. Lassiter...

12:35.574 --> 12:37.374
- Objection, your honor.
- ...on the way to the airport?

12:37.376 --> 12:38.742
Withdrawn.

12:38.744 --> 12:40.644
Sit down, Mr. Ramsey.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.015
<i>You're excused.</i>

12:45.017 --> 12:48.685
This is what losing looks like,

12:48.687 --> 12:51.588
but it's the best I can do
until you start talking to me.

12:56.928 --> 12:59.363
<i>Boone fucked everything
that walked.</i>

12:59.365 --> 13:02.499
<i>It didn't relate to the case,
but it made Boone look bad.</i>

13:02.501 --> 13:06.036
<i>I figured Loretta knew and
didn't care as long as it helped Mike.</i>

13:06.038 --> 13:07.504
<i>Mr. Ramsey,
I'm Janelle Brady.</i>

13:07.506 --> 13:08.739
You're too late.

13:08.741 --> 13:10.507
No, I'm not. I wasn't...

13:10.509 --> 13:12.376
Just as we feared.
Juror number three.

13:12.378 --> 13:13.910
Gave you the stink eye
after you crossed?

13:13.912 --> 13:16.146
Yeah, I caught it.

13:16.148 --> 13:17.781
Janelle Brady, Jack Legrand.

13:17.783 --> 13:19.916
Janelle is
Walter Brady's daughter.

13:19.918 --> 13:23.019
I asked him to sit second chair
for me, but he couldn't.

13:23.021 --> 13:25.155
He recommended Janelle.

13:25.157 --> 13:27.591
Her dad is also famous
for being late,

13:27.593 --> 13:30.060
but never to court.

13:30.062 --> 13:31.061
Are you kidding me?

13:31.063 --> 13:32.062
Concerned women for America?

13:32.064 --> 13:33.400
Don't even ask.

13:33.401 --> 13:35.465
<i>I was sitting
in the back the whole time.</i>

13:35.467 --> 13:37.067
You missed jury selection.

13:37.069 --> 13:40.070
I know, I'm sorry.
I tried calling.

13:40.072 --> 13:43.106
I'm on trial. I don't answer
my phone when I'm on trial.

13:43.108 --> 13:45.542
Well...

13:45.544 --> 13:49.446
We still got two blacks, two single moms,
and an unemployed white kid.

13:49.448 --> 13:51.448
Shit. That ain't no guarantee.

13:51.450 --> 13:53.450
- <i>Call you this afternoon.</i>
- Keep on it.

13:57.121 --> 13:58.755
You want a job or not?

14:02.760 --> 14:04.060
Ramsey.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.197
Five minutes.

14:07.199 --> 14:08.498
Okay.

14:10.435 --> 14:12.035
Legrand's your jury consultant?

14:13.871 --> 14:15.806
Ran out of challenges,

14:15.808 --> 14:18.508
and got stuck
with juror number three...

14:18.510 --> 14:21.144
Heiress to oil money
with nothing to do

14:21.146 --> 14:24.147
but worry about people
stealing from her.

14:24.149 --> 14:26.082
She's the kind that thinks

14:26.084 --> 14:30.587
the death penalty
isn't severe enough.

14:30.589 --> 14:32.856
<i>So besides being
Walter Brady's daughter,</i>

14:32.858 --> 14:34.658
tell me who you are.

14:36.861 --> 14:39.796
I graduated Vanderbilt '07,

14:39.798 --> 14:41.598
Columbia for law.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.999
Won all my mock trials,

14:43.001 --> 14:45.669
then came back home
to work at Morris and Duprey,

14:45.671 --> 14:49.473
but the corporate grind wasn't
my thing, so I took a year off.

14:49.475 --> 14:50.841
To do what?

14:52.844 --> 14:55.879
Regroup.

14:55.881 --> 14:58.748
In river oaks?

14:58.750 --> 15:00.016
Thanks, dad.

15:00.018 --> 15:01.585
They put you on meds?

15:03.921 --> 15:05.922
No shame in it.

15:05.924 --> 15:09.025
I spent 18 months on antidepressants.
You still on 'em?

15:09.027 --> 15:11.027
A low dosage.

15:11.029 --> 15:13.497
<i>'Cause once
I introduce you in court,</i>

15:13.499 --> 15:15.499
you can't decide halfway through

15:15.501 --> 15:18.668
that it's not your thing.

15:18.670 --> 15:21.505
I'll be there.

15:21.507 --> 15:24.808
Your dad says you've got
a world-class bullshit detector.

15:24.810 --> 15:26.009
Who lied this morning?

15:26.011 --> 15:28.078
On the stand, you mean?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.779
They don't teach this
in law school.

15:29.781 --> 15:31.982
Yes, all witnesses lie.

15:31.984 --> 15:34.184
About what?

15:34.186 --> 15:37.053
Keeping their jobs,

15:37.055 --> 15:40.223
winning the case, money...

15:40.225 --> 15:42.659
Most people skim... morality.

15:42.661 --> 15:45.996
<i>We all want to be good
little girls and boys.</i>

15:45.998 --> 15:48.164
Sex... just assume everyone's
screwing everyone else

15:48.166 --> 15:49.799
unless proven otherwise.

15:49.801 --> 15:54.638
<i>And the big one,
avoiding humiliation.</i>

15:54.640 --> 15:57.674
You'd think folks would be scared
of prison or lethal injection.

15:57.676 --> 16:00.243
Nope.

16:00.245 --> 16:02.913
It's loss of face.

16:02.915 --> 16:05.715
And this morning,
the flight attendant...

16:05.717 --> 16:09.319
Angela Morley?

16:09.321 --> 16:11.555
She seemed evasive

16:11.557 --> 16:14.257
when you asked about
passenger manifests,

16:14.259 --> 16:17.561
looked at her hands
after she answered.

16:17.563 --> 16:20.764
I guess Lassiter
took women on his flights.

16:20.766 --> 16:24.701
And she didn't want to lose her
next job admitting as much.

16:24.703 --> 16:25.802
Next?

16:25.804 --> 16:29.139
The limo driver...

16:29.141 --> 16:32.842
Went out of his way to say
he drove straight to the airport.

16:32.844 --> 16:35.779
So maybe they stopped
to pick up a woman?

16:35.781 --> 16:38.715
And me?

16:38.717 --> 16:40.350
What did I lie about?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.721
You've been on a private plane?

16:44.723 --> 16:47.857
And since we walked
in this room?

16:47.859 --> 16:50.060
You've never taken an
antidepressant in your life.

16:52.129 --> 16:54.331
Not unless bourbon counts.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.299
<i>As you heard,</i>

16:56.301 --> 16:58.602
<i>my client isn't speaking
to anyone,</i>

16:58.604 --> 17:00.770
including me,

17:00.772 --> 17:03.873
which means I have to defend him
without knowing all the facts,

17:03.875 --> 17:06.876
which means I'm finding out
the facts on the fly.

17:06.877 --> 17:10.714
So if your bullshit detector
goes off, you tell me.

17:10.715 --> 17:14.684
Other than that,
you're window dressing.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.820
A mixed-race woman at the table
who thinks your client is innocent.

17:17.823 --> 17:20.357
That's the deal.

17:20.358 --> 17:22.291
Your honor.

17:22.294 --> 17:23.792
I wish to introduce my associate

17:23.795 --> 17:25.628
Janelle Brady to the court.

17:25.631 --> 17:27.696
Relation to Walter Brady?

17:27.699 --> 17:30.300
<i>Yes, your honor, his daughter.</i>

17:30.302 --> 17:31.868
Fine lawyer.

17:38.943 --> 17:41.845
I got a call at 4:42 P.M.

17:41.847 --> 17:44.648
Domestic violence, possible 187.

17:44.650 --> 17:46.850
And 187 is?

17:46.852 --> 17:48.318
Homicide.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.054
And this is late afternoon
on February 4th.

17:51.056 --> 17:52.288
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

17:52.290 --> 17:53.790
<i>And you responded?</i>

17:53.792 --> 17:55.425
I was the closest car.

17:56.994 --> 17:58.361
<i>I didn't know whether</i>

17:58.363 --> 18:00.430
<i>I should wait
for backup or go in,</i>

18:00.432 --> 18:02.966
but I was told the situation
was under control,

18:02.968 --> 18:05.068
<i>so I went in.</i>

18:13.177 --> 18:16.279
Please hurry.
It's my husband.

18:30.728 --> 18:32.295
Who is that?

18:32.297 --> 18:34.864
Michael, our son.

18:34.866 --> 18:36.099
<i>What did you do first?</i>

18:36.101 --> 18:39.235
I made sure the victim was dead.

18:41.272 --> 18:42.439
<i>He was.</i>

18:42.441 --> 18:45.175
<i>Hello? Loretta?</i>

18:45.177 --> 18:47.777
I called our lawyer. I'll go.

18:52.149 --> 18:54.050
I should've done this
a long time ago.

18:56.020 --> 18:59.122
<i>And what if, anything,
did Mike say?</i>

19:01.992 --> 19:03.727
"I should've done it
a long time ago."

19:03.729 --> 19:05.228
<i>Objection, your honor.</i>

19:05.230 --> 19:06.863
This is inconsistent

19:06.865 --> 19:08.131
with the officer's
prior sworn statement.

19:08.133 --> 19:10.100
Judge, I'm simply clarifying...

19:10.102 --> 19:13.870
Officer steed's
police report states...

19:13.872 --> 19:16.506
"Should've done this
a long time ago,"

19:16.508 --> 19:19.008
not "I should've."

19:19.010 --> 19:21.144
Without a pronoun,
my client might have meant,

19:21.146 --> 19:23.313
"someone should've done this
a long time ago,"

19:23.315 --> 19:26.916
suggesting that
someone else did.

19:26.918 --> 19:28.151
Continue.

19:28.153 --> 19:29.953
Well, which was it?

19:29.955 --> 19:31.855
Hang on a second.

19:35.292 --> 19:37.227
Yes, I'm sure.

19:37.229 --> 19:40.897
He said, "I should've done it
a long time ago."

19:40.899 --> 19:43.366
I should've done this
a long time ago.

19:59.016 --> 20:01.184
<i>How long did it take
the other officers to arrive?</i>

20:01.186 --> 20:03.453
Only a few minutes.

20:03.455 --> 20:05.789
I told the lawyer, mister, um...

20:05.791 --> 20:07.190
<i>Mr. Ramsey.</i>

20:07.192 --> 20:09.192
Yes, sir, I told him,

20:09.194 --> 20:11.161
I need the boy to step away
from the body.

20:13.531 --> 20:16.166
Mike.

20:16.168 --> 20:17.567
He needs to step back.

20:19.136 --> 20:22.939
Honey?

20:22.941 --> 20:24.507
We need to leave the room now

20:24.509 --> 20:26.876
so the police can do
their work, okay?

20:33.217 --> 20:36.252
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you both
to stay nearby.

20:37.988 --> 20:39.222
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:39.224 --> 20:41.591
No further questions,
your honor.

20:41.593 --> 20:43.226
Mr. Ramsey?

20:46.063 --> 20:47.063
<i>You're excused.</i>

20:50.067 --> 20:52.101
We're in recess until
9:00 A.M. in the morning.

20:52.103 --> 20:55.538
You see, Mike? You see how
it sounds in open court?

20:55.540 --> 20:57.373
"I should've done this
a long time ago."

20:57.375 --> 20:59.409
To a cop? Really?

20:59.411 --> 21:01.845
Unless you start talking to me,
we're going down.

21:01.847 --> 21:03.279
<i>All rise.</i>

21:09.486 --> 21:12.488
Why won't he talk to you?

21:12.490 --> 21:15.859
That's the problem
with people who refuse to speak.

21:15.861 --> 21:17.001
They never say why.

21:19.263 --> 21:23.600
You're cocky for a kid going
to prison for life.

21:23.602 --> 21:25.869
- Did he say anything to you?
- Loretta Lassiter,

21:25.871 --> 21:27.270
Janelle Brady.

21:27.272 --> 21:28.905
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:28.907 --> 21:31.007
Is he talking?

21:31.009 --> 21:34.010
- Loretta...
- Ramsey, I'm terrified!

21:34.012 --> 21:35.612
You can't let him go to prison.

21:35.614 --> 21:37.547
Relax, Loretta.
It's the first day.

21:37.549 --> 21:39.148
He's a boy.

21:39.150 --> 21:41.384
The papers make him
look like some monster.

21:41.386 --> 21:42.552
I know. I know that.

21:42.554 --> 21:44.287
The way it sounds in there...

21:44.289 --> 21:46.055
It always sounds bad
in the beginning.

21:46.057 --> 21:48.091
I want to see him.
Can I... Can I see him?

21:48.093 --> 21:49.192
Yeah, if you can get down there

21:49.194 --> 21:50.660
before they put him in the Van.

21:56.533 --> 22:00.570
What a horrible position
for her to be in.

22:00.572 --> 22:04.607
Yeah, mother of the accused
is never easy.

22:04.609 --> 22:06.643
Loretta's, actually,
compared to some...

22:06.645 --> 22:09.946
She's pretty calm.

22:09.948 --> 22:12.916
- Where's your car?
- Oh, around the corner.

22:12.918 --> 22:14.684
They sent you to c lot?

22:18.055 --> 22:21.291
Room 254 at the Marina hotel.

22:22.326 --> 22:25.194
Our war room.

22:25.196 --> 22:27.230
You don't have an office?

22:27.232 --> 22:28.564
Yeah.

22:28.566 --> 22:30.633
People there who expect me
to return phone calls

22:30.635 --> 22:34.337
and answer emails
and god knows what.

22:34.339 --> 22:37.173
Everything we need
is in room 254.

22:37.175 --> 22:39.943
Witness statements, police reports,
coroner's report.

22:39.945 --> 22:42.612
Are you coming?

22:42.614 --> 22:46.282
Got it all up here, I hope.

22:46.284 --> 22:48.384
Tomorrow, 9:00 o'clock, okay?

22:55.459 --> 22:57.627
<i>I doubted miss
Ivy league corporate law</i>

22:57.629 --> 23:01.497
<i>would come back when she saw
what she was getting into.</i>

23:01.499 --> 23:03.099
<i>But just sitting there
beside Mike,</i>

23:03.101 --> 23:04.567
<i>she would help him look</i>

23:04.569 --> 23:07.236
<i>less like a spoiled rich kid
or a sociopath,</i>

23:07.238 --> 23:09.005
<i>maybe even get him to talk.</i>

23:46.677 --> 23:48.444
<i>Funny thing was,
I second-seated</i>

23:48.446 --> 23:51.447
<i>my first murder trial
with Boone.</i>

23:51.449 --> 23:54.717
<i>It was a case where a teenage mother
suffocated her own infant,</i>

23:54.719 --> 23:58.454
<i>put him in a garbage bag,
and threw him in the bayou.</i>

23:58.456 --> 24:02.425
<i>The pictures alone
convicted her.</i>

24:02.427 --> 24:04.160
<i>But Boone kept saying,</i>

24:04.162 --> 24:07.597
<i>"if you can stand her,
so can the jury."</i>

24:07.599 --> 24:10.166
<i>He had me talk to her,
put my hand on hers.</i>

24:10.168 --> 24:12.468
<i>Every day I told her
she looked pretty.</i>

24:12.470 --> 24:14.637
<i>Those little things counted.</i>

24:14.639 --> 24:16.806
<i>Please, tell us,
how did you know the deceased?</i>

24:16.808 --> 24:20.176
He was my neighbor
for the last 15 years.

24:20.178 --> 24:21.577
<i>Your next-door neighbor?</i>

24:21.579 --> 24:22.578
Yes.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.313
And were you friends?

24:24.315 --> 24:26.349
I liked Boone.

24:26.351 --> 24:28.584
My wife found him entertaining.

24:28.586 --> 24:30.153
Do you do that down thing?

24:30.155 --> 24:31.587
The down thing?

24:31.589 --> 24:33.189
<i>Our son Alexander</i>

24:33.191 --> 24:36.259
<i>was a classmate with Mike
at Newman,</i>

24:36.261 --> 24:38.061
so we took down the fence
between the yards

24:38.063 --> 24:39.595
so that the boys
could play together.

24:39.597 --> 24:42.065
How would you describe
the relationship

24:42.067 --> 24:43.800
between Boone and Mike?

24:43.802 --> 24:46.702
Very close.

24:46.704 --> 24:49.072
<i>Loretta was sort of
the odd woman out.</i>

24:52.811 --> 24:55.511
<i>Mike wanted to be
a lawyer like his dad.</i>

24:55.513 --> 24:57.480
See the lawyer?

24:57.482 --> 25:00.083
Dressed too fancy.
Jury's not gonna like him.

25:00.085 --> 25:02.085
<i>Mike was a very quick study.</i>

25:02.087 --> 25:04.487
He became kind of like
a legal junkie.

25:04.489 --> 25:06.622
He was a very, very bright kid.

25:06.624 --> 25:10.493
When Mike was 12, he wanted
to go to forensic camp.

25:10.495 --> 25:13.096
I'm sorry.
Forensic camp?

25:13.098 --> 25:15.098
Well, it's like "CSI," you know?

25:15.100 --> 25:17.233
You learn how to break down
a crime scene.

25:17.235 --> 25:19.869
<i>Anyway, when he got back...</i>

25:19.871 --> 25:23.239
Well, there was something
going on, on our block.

25:23.241 --> 25:26.709
Someone had poisoned
a neighbor's cat.

25:26.711 --> 25:30.680
And Mike, I don't know how...

25:32.783 --> 25:34.650
<i>But he figured out who did it.</i>

25:34.652 --> 25:37.153
Yeah, got his picture
in the paper.

25:37.155 --> 25:38.654
<i>Now, this closeness,</i>

25:38.656 --> 25:42.258
<i>the bond between father and son,</i>

25:42.260 --> 25:45.828
did that continue until
the death of the victim?

25:45.830 --> 25:47.630
No, no.

25:47.632 --> 25:49.198
Something happened.
I mean, I don't know,

25:49.200 --> 25:51.567
it might've been, you know,

25:51.569 --> 25:55.838
adolescent rebellion,
but it came out...

25:55.840 --> 26:00.276
Well, I guess it was about
eight months before Boone died.

26:00.278 --> 26:02.245
<i>Well, I don't want
to give offense</i>

26:02.247 --> 26:04.814
<i>to any of you candy-ass
liberals here,</i>

26:04.816 --> 26:07.350
<i>well, maybe, if you get...</i>

26:07.352 --> 26:09.485
Well, look.
I'm not stupid, okay?

26:09.487 --> 26:12.155
I'm gonna vote
for my own self-interest.

26:12.157 --> 26:14.657
Of course.

26:14.659 --> 26:17.593
Everyone should vote
their own interest.

26:17.595 --> 26:21.164
That's how democracy's
supposed to work.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.632
Is that so?

26:22.634 --> 26:26.402
Well, sure. I mean...

26:26.404 --> 26:28.437
I was just agreeing with you.

26:31.375 --> 26:34.210
I was agreeing with you.

26:35.879 --> 26:37.446
You were?

26:42.586 --> 26:43.653
"Of course."

26:45.756 --> 26:48.925
You said "of course."

26:48.927 --> 26:52.428
As if I said something obvious.

26:52.430 --> 26:54.697
Come on, Boone.

26:54.699 --> 26:56.732
Maybe you're a little drunk, huh?

26:56.734 --> 26:58.601
I am drunk.

26:58.603 --> 27:00.603
And tomorrow,

27:00.605 --> 27:03.406
I'm gonna wake up
with a big hangover.

27:03.408 --> 27:05.408
And you...

27:05.410 --> 27:08.978
<i>You're still gonna be stupid.</i>

27:08.980 --> 27:13.449
Now listen, nobody gives
a fuck what you think.

27:13.451 --> 27:14.817
Don't you know that by now?

27:16.486 --> 27:18.254
<i>You went to typing school.</i>

27:20.658 --> 27:24.227
<i>You should be like Trixie over here,
she takes care of herself.</i>

27:24.229 --> 27:26.896
She's smart. She's got a degree
in dental hygiene...

27:26.898 --> 27:28.431
Stop it!

27:37.641 --> 27:40.243
- So you spoke up.
- Yes.

27:40.245 --> 27:42.645
- You tried to stop him.
- I did.

27:42.647 --> 27:44.614
<i>Then what happened?</i>

27:49.853 --> 27:51.687
Hey.

27:51.689 --> 27:54.357
Boone.

27:54.359 --> 27:56.325
Come on. Let's just...

27:56.327 --> 27:59.528
I got this. I got this, dude.
I'm okay.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.770
First, come here.

28:07.772 --> 28:10.439
<i>No one spoke
to Boone that way.</i>

28:10.441 --> 28:11.807
<i>No one.</i>

28:16.046 --> 28:18.414
<i>Well, I couldn't...
I couldn't hear</i>

28:18.416 --> 28:20.883
<i>what Boone said to him,</i>

28:20.885 --> 28:24.320
<i>but I could see the effect
it had on Mike.</i>

28:26.056 --> 28:27.623
Look at me.

28:31.695 --> 28:33.963
<i>And after they'd
finished their conversation,</i>

28:33.965 --> 28:38.768
Boone walked over to me.

28:38.770 --> 28:42.305
You got something to say?

28:42.307 --> 28:44.073
It's none of your business.

28:45.976 --> 28:47.843
<i>You know...</i>

28:47.845 --> 28:50.746
You look at me like that again
then I'm gonna kick

28:50.748 --> 28:53.683
your little ass back to that
shitty little house of yours.

28:55.652 --> 28:57.453
There's nothing I'd enjoy more.

28:59.790 --> 29:02.958
There's dessert if anybody's
still hungry.

29:02.960 --> 29:07.563
So as you can imagine,
that was the end of our friendship.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.000
I didn't want Alex
going over there.

29:11.002 --> 29:14.470
I didn't want him to have anything
to do with that type of behavior.

29:14.472 --> 29:17.373
Thank you. No further questions,
your honor.

29:18.642 --> 29:19.842
Mr. Ramsey?

29:21.345 --> 29:23.679
Nothing from me, your honor.

29:23.681 --> 29:26.082
<i>You may step down.</i>

29:26.084 --> 29:29.819
Want me to work harder?
Start talking.

29:34.358 --> 29:36.659
<i>So, what's our defense here?</i>

29:36.661 --> 29:41.063
You mean are we screwed?
Don't know.

29:41.065 --> 29:44.500
Unless Mike talks to me,
all we've got is "defense of others."

29:44.502 --> 29:47.470
Like someone who shoots first
to prevent a murder?

29:47.472 --> 29:48.838
Right.

29:51.508 --> 29:54.543
I gotta tell you,
it's pretty brutal in there.

29:56.513 --> 29:58.514
It's not all bad.

29:58.516 --> 30:00.816
How do you mean?

30:00.818 --> 30:03.552
How much do you know
about Muhammad Ali?

30:03.554 --> 30:05.921
I know he didn't go
to law school.

30:05.923 --> 30:07.390
Better than that.

30:07.392 --> 30:10.459
In 1974, he took on
George foreman,

30:10.461 --> 30:12.528
who was seven years younger,

30:12.530 --> 30:14.797
and had knocked out
every man he'd fought.

30:14.799 --> 30:16.799
<i>Foreman was at his peak.</i>

30:16.801 --> 30:18.401
And Ali, round after round,

30:18.403 --> 30:19.969
just stood there
getting pounded.

30:19.971 --> 30:21.670
He wouldn't or
couldn't fight back.

30:21.672 --> 30:22.938
No one knew which.

30:22.940 --> 30:26.842
- You mean the rope-a-dope?
- Yeah.

30:27.944 --> 30:29.945
And finally,
in the eighth round,

30:29.947 --> 30:32.681
foreman got tired,

30:32.683 --> 30:35.918
tired of punching,
exhausted himself.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.422
Suddenly, Ali came to life.

30:39.424 --> 30:43.626
In one round, foreman was on
the canvas like an old man.

30:43.628 --> 30:46.128
What are you saying?

30:46.130 --> 30:49.131
For the rest
of the day, we lose.

30:52.469 --> 30:54.570
And in this kind of situation,
detective,

30:54.572 --> 30:56.105
apparently a family dispute,

30:56.107 --> 30:59.074
- is there a normal...
- The spouse.

30:59.076 --> 31:00.843
Excuse me?

31:00.845 --> 31:03.112
Anyone who's married,
the spouse is the first suspect.

31:03.114 --> 31:06.849
But you moved off this
hypothesis pretty quickly.

31:06.851 --> 31:08.651
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:08.653 --> 31:10.052
<i>Well, I first spoke
with the officer on the scene.</i>

31:10.054 --> 31:11.787
Anything unusual?

31:11.789 --> 31:13.956
The kid said, "should've done this
a long time ago."

31:13.958 --> 31:15.458
<i>She told me what the boy said.</i>

31:15.460 --> 31:16.725
And that knife from the wall.

31:19.830 --> 31:21.831
<i>And I took a look at the knife.</i>

31:23.633 --> 31:25.134
<i>And it was the print,</i>

31:25.136 --> 31:28.537
or the size of the palm print
that changed your focus.

31:28.539 --> 31:30.673
Yes.

31:30.675 --> 31:33.008
But to be safe, we took the boy and
his mother down for questioning.

31:33.010 --> 31:35.244
- Where were you...
- <i>And how did that go with Mike?</i>

31:35.246 --> 31:38.681
At the time of the incident?
You need to answer...

31:38.683 --> 31:40.916
He's not talking at all.

31:44.955 --> 31:46.222
First of all, I want to say...

31:46.224 --> 31:48.557
<i>And his mother?</i>

31:48.559 --> 31:51.861
<i>Mother didn't have
anything to say,</i>

31:51.863 --> 31:53.863
<i>on advice of counsel.</i>

31:55.899 --> 31:57.733
Thank you, detective.
No further.

32:04.140 --> 32:06.742
<i>You were the lead detective
on this case, is that right?</i>

32:06.744 --> 32:08.644
Yes, sir.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.713
And you said that from the start
you didn't pursue

32:10.715 --> 32:13.182
any suspects other than
the defendant.

32:13.184 --> 32:14.917
That's correct.

32:14.919 --> 32:17.553
Why was that?

32:17.555 --> 32:19.822
You want me to answer that?

32:19.824 --> 32:21.190
Yes.

32:26.830 --> 32:28.631
<i>Because...</i>

32:30.000 --> 32:33.569
In my professional opinion,

32:33.571 --> 32:36.539
it was open and shut.

32:36.541 --> 32:37.773
That boy did it.

32:45.549 --> 32:48.551
No further questions,
your honor.

32:48.553 --> 32:50.686
<i>Mike was a fucking vault.</i>

32:50.688 --> 32:53.689
<i>I decided to let him think
I'd given up,</i>

32:53.691 --> 32:58.561
<i>let the evidence roll in,
invite it.</i>

32:58.563 --> 32:59.895
<i>Hopefully, the jury would think</i>

32:59.897 --> 33:01.597
<i>it was going too well</i>

33:01.599 --> 33:04.567
<i>and start rooting
for the underdog</i>

33:04.569 --> 33:05.935
<i>without even knowing it.</i>

33:08.838 --> 33:11.106
And this is from the New Orleans
crime lab and evidence division?

33:11.108 --> 33:13.142
Yes, sir.

33:18.949 --> 33:20.950
Sir, what was
the cause of death?

33:20.952 --> 33:23.319
Knife entered the box...

33:23.321 --> 33:24.987
Central area of the chest.

33:24.989 --> 33:27.590
- Just one stab.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

33:27.592 --> 33:31.594
It severed the aorta, resulting in a
sudden and massive loss of blood.

33:31.596 --> 33:34.263
<i>Victim lost consciousness
in a matter of seconds.</i>

33:37.667 --> 33:40.002
<i>Died in under a minute.</i>

33:40.004 --> 33:41.370
Thank you.

33:43.006 --> 33:45.608
So the victim had
no scratches on him,

33:45.610 --> 33:48.777
no defensive marks,
no skin under his nails.

33:48.779 --> 33:50.613
<i>Which led me to believe
he knew his assailant</i>

33:50.615 --> 33:53.148
and was taken by surprise.

33:53.150 --> 33:56.251
You were in the room
at the time of the murder?

33:56.253 --> 34:00.122
No, sir.

34:00.124 --> 34:02.825
Any hairs on the victim's clothing?

34:02.827 --> 34:06.195
From the defendant,
and his mother.

34:06.197 --> 34:08.630
Plus some other people who had
entered the scene post mortem.

34:08.632 --> 34:10.331
And the rest of the house,

34:10.333 --> 34:13.101
the hall, bathroom, stairs?

34:13.103 --> 34:14.902
Your staff did
a sweep of that, too?

34:14.905 --> 34:18.172
Yes, and found no
material evidence.

34:18.175 --> 34:20.208
<i>Nothing? A stray hair?</i>

34:20.210 --> 34:22.344
<i>A drop of blood?
Nothing at all?</i>

34:22.346 --> 34:23.712
<i>Look at this.</i>

34:23.714 --> 34:26.148
The mom said she was

34:26.150 --> 34:29.685
in the shower when it happened,
washing her hair,

34:29.687 --> 34:33.022
but they found all these
hairs in the sink drain

34:33.024 --> 34:34.389
and only this one in the shower.

34:34.391 --> 34:37.159
So she mixed up
where she washed her hair.

34:40.429 --> 34:43.931
Scott, that is the exact kind
of detail to confuse a jury.

34:43.934 --> 34:45.134
Uh-huh.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.338
No other evidence.

34:49.340 --> 34:51.005
<i>Sir, you're telling me
there was nothing at all</i>

34:51.007 --> 34:53.442
which might directly
or indirectly

34:53.444 --> 34:56.277
point to a suspect
other than the defendant?

34:58.014 --> 34:59.081
That's correct.

34:59.083 --> 35:02.084
Which makes this a perfect case.

35:04.187 --> 35:05.754
Is that a question?

35:08.158 --> 35:09.692
No, sir.

35:09.694 --> 35:12.061
<i>No further questions.</i>

35:12.063 --> 35:14.697
<i>You may be excused,
Mr. Doucette.</i>

35:18.702 --> 35:20.069
<i>And you live
next door to the Lassiters?</i>

35:20.071 --> 35:21.236
Yes, sir.

35:21.238 --> 35:22.871
<i>Since you were how old?</i>

35:22.873 --> 35:24.273
Two.

35:24.275 --> 35:26.375
<i>And you and Mike were friends.</i>

35:26.377 --> 35:29.378
Mostly when we were kids.

35:29.380 --> 35:32.014
<i>But your families were friendly.</i>

35:32.016 --> 35:33.082
Uh-huh.

35:46.396 --> 35:48.397
Alexander.

35:48.399 --> 35:51.166
Uh, yes, I guess
we were all friends.

35:51.168 --> 35:53.769
The defendant, Mike.

35:53.771 --> 35:56.405
Your father testified
that he and his dad,

35:56.407 --> 35:58.474
<i>that their relationship
went downhill.</i>

35:58.476 --> 36:01.043
- Yes.
- <i>And you saw that.</i>

36:01.045 --> 36:02.411
Yes, I did.

36:02.413 --> 36:04.947
<i>Now tell us, please,
what you saw.</i>

36:09.419 --> 36:12.387
To be honest,
I was kind of jealous.

36:12.389 --> 36:14.022
They seemed so close.

36:14.024 --> 36:16.992
- But that changed.
- <i>That's right.</i>

36:16.994 --> 36:19.061
Why?

36:19.063 --> 36:21.764
It had something do to with...

36:21.766 --> 36:25.901
<i>Mike wouldn't say,
but I could tell</i>

36:25.903 --> 36:28.337
it had something
to do with his mom.

36:28.339 --> 36:30.038
<i>Why do you think it had
something to do with her?</i>

36:30.040 --> 36:33.375
Was it something that he said?

36:33.377 --> 36:35.778
Something she said?

36:35.780 --> 36:38.347
No, she never said anything...

36:38.349 --> 36:40.949
<i>No!</i>

36:46.422 --> 36:50.526
Oh, ow! Come on.
You're hurting me.

36:50.528 --> 36:53.395
Ow. Baby!

36:53.397 --> 36:55.264
<i>And did you witness
the backyard incident</i>

36:55.266 --> 36:56.965
<i>between Mike and his father?</i>

36:58.301 --> 36:59.501
Yes.

36:59.503 --> 37:02.070
Well, no, no.
I did not witness

37:02.072 --> 37:04.273
what my dad called
"the backyard incident".

37:04.275 --> 37:06.942
But it was after this that
the change came over Mike.

37:06.944 --> 37:09.411
No, before.

37:09.413 --> 37:10.946
At least six months.

37:10.948 --> 37:13.348
<i>For Mike to say that to his dad,</i>

37:13.350 --> 37:16.185
he must've stewed about it
for a while.

37:20.957 --> 37:25.160
<i>A blind man could see
he had a thing for Loretta.</i>

37:25.162 --> 37:27.262
<i>I just tried to keep him talking
long enough</i>

37:27.264 --> 37:29.364
<i>for the jury to catch on.</i>

37:32.001 --> 37:34.269
Alexander,
did you ever see Boone

37:34.271 --> 37:36.471
being unpleasant to his wife?

37:36.473 --> 37:38.540
Um, yes.

37:38.542 --> 37:40.976
- Rude?
- Yes.

37:40.978 --> 37:42.377
Abusive?

37:42.379 --> 37:44.346
- <i>Come here!</i>
- <i>No!</i>

37:48.118 --> 37:50.185
<i>Come here.
Come here, god damn it.</i>

37:50.187 --> 37:51.520
<i>No!</i>

37:51.522 --> 37:54.923
Maybe.

37:54.925 --> 37:56.325
It's not your family.

37:56.327 --> 37:58.087
You can never tell
what they consider normal.

38:00.431 --> 38:04.867
Did you ever see him
behave brutally toward her?

38:04.869 --> 38:07.603
Let me hear it!

38:07.605 --> 38:10.405
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>No, Boone!</i>

38:12.142 --> 38:16.044
Brutally? I don't know.

38:16.046 --> 38:19.882
Fine. You never saw that.

38:19.884 --> 38:23.218
But was there something
about their relationship,

38:23.220 --> 38:25.387
their marriage,

38:25.389 --> 38:27.956
that made you uncomfortable?

38:30.894 --> 38:33.262
She was kind of...

38:36.032 --> 38:39.268
She was fading away, day by day.

38:39.270 --> 38:42.571
He was so mean to her.

38:46.175 --> 38:48.477
It was like she didn't want
to live anymore.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.930
No redirect, your honor.

39:07.932 --> 39:10.032
Loretta. Loretta.

39:13.603 --> 39:17.706
They're gonna call you tomorrow.
Are you ready?

39:17.708 --> 39:19.608
You're sure I can't refuse?

39:19.610 --> 39:22.177
You can, yeah,
but you'll go to jail for contempt.

39:22.179 --> 39:24.279
I can't help you with that one.

39:24.281 --> 39:26.281
A wife doesn't have
to testify against her husband,

39:26.283 --> 39:29.418
but a mother does
against her child?

39:29.420 --> 39:32.087
Like the bond is somehow
less or something?

39:32.089 --> 39:34.289
Loretta, we've gone over this.

39:34.291 --> 39:35.991
It's part of our strategy.

39:35.993 --> 39:37.426
If they don't call you, I will,

39:37.428 --> 39:39.494
and it's better if they do

39:39.496 --> 39:42.397
so, we stick to
the strategy, yes?

39:47.236 --> 39:48.704
Bad of you to smoke.

39:48.706 --> 39:52.474
I know. Keeps me from
eating everything.

39:52.476 --> 39:54.743
- Hey Mike.
- Oh, hey.

39:57.580 --> 40:00.449
- How is he?
- He's okay, I guess.

40:00.451 --> 40:02.184
He really wants to go to Reed,

40:02.186 --> 40:04.219
but Boone keeps pushing him
toward Stanford

40:04.221 --> 40:06.588
'cause it's more prestigious.

40:06.590 --> 40:08.290
I can't really say anything

40:08.292 --> 40:09.491
'cause I didn't even go
to college, so...

40:09.493 --> 40:12.327
Hey!

40:12.329 --> 40:14.029
<i>How about some drinks over here?</i>

40:14.031 --> 40:15.297
Well, he's a smart kid.

40:15.299 --> 40:17.666
He'll do fine wherever he is.

40:17.668 --> 40:20.435
I just wish
I knew how to help him.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.374
I just read something.

40:27.543 --> 40:30.746
If someone says
vicious things to you,

40:30.748 --> 40:35.017
it's the same
to your brain waves

40:35.019 --> 40:36.752
reacting or something...

40:38.421 --> 40:43.025
It's exactly the same
as being hit.

40:43.027 --> 40:46.428
Hey, my father hit me
sometimes when he was drunk.

40:46.430 --> 40:47.796
I'm all right.

40:50.033 --> 40:52.667
Well, I hate myself
for not protecting Mike.

40:55.571 --> 40:57.439
I mentioned
divorce once to Boone.

40:57.441 --> 40:59.508
He said he'd kill me.

40:59.510 --> 41:02.110
"Oh, I'd find you. With my money,
you could count on it."

41:02.112 --> 41:06.415
- Loretta...
- then he'd laugh, like it's a joke.

41:06.417 --> 41:07.516
Wasn't a joke.

41:13.823 --> 41:16.591
<i>Okay, the lies?</i>

41:16.593 --> 41:19.261
Putting aside the
weirdness with Alex?

41:22.198 --> 41:25.700
What was up with detective
graves not pursuing other leads,

41:25.702 --> 41:27.402
gathering forensic evidence?

41:27.404 --> 41:29.438
He had a confession.

41:29.440 --> 41:32.274
Didn't think he needed to.

41:32.276 --> 41:34.476
Well, why didn't you go
after him on the stand?

41:34.478 --> 41:37.779
<i>Never humiliate a cop in front
of a jury unless you have to.</i>

41:37.781 --> 41:41.550
Besides, we're still
doing the rope-a-dope.

41:48.758 --> 41:51.493
I don't know,
it all feels so one-sided.

41:51.495 --> 41:55.597
Okay, I got two hours before I have
to prep Loretta for her testimony.

42:00.503 --> 42:04.239
But first, I need to eat
some real food.

42:07.577 --> 42:09.778
What landed you at river oaks?

42:12.548 --> 42:14.382
Oh, that.

42:14.384 --> 42:17.385
Um...

42:17.387 --> 42:20.555
Kind of embarrassing.

42:20.557 --> 42:21.557
A guy.

42:24.260 --> 42:28.263
At the firm. A partner.

42:28.265 --> 42:31.466
He was married.

42:31.468 --> 42:34.503
- An affair.
- Mm.

42:38.274 --> 42:40.509
Well, it...

42:40.511 --> 42:43.812
Sort of became an obsession.

42:43.814 --> 42:47.282
Clinically, that is.

42:47.284 --> 42:50.552
What? Did you stalk him?

42:52.255 --> 42:54.823
Called him, texted him,

42:54.825 --> 42:58.260
10 times a day or more.

42:58.262 --> 43:01.296
Followed him,
parked outside his house.

43:04.834 --> 43:09.404
His wife figured it out
and called the firm.

43:11.474 --> 43:13.842
They fired you.

43:13.844 --> 43:15.410
Yep.

43:17.713 --> 43:21.516
River oaks seemed like the best
available option at that point.

43:25.188 --> 43:26.588
So, you crazy?

43:28.257 --> 43:29.624
Was.

43:35.898 --> 43:39.701
Well, I gotta go prep
Loretta for testimony.

43:51.981 --> 43:53.682
<i>Walt had
neglected to tell me</i>

43:53.684 --> 43:56.484
<i>the actual circumstances
of her commitment,</i>

43:56.486 --> 43:59.354
<i>implied it was voluntary,</i>

43:59.356 --> 44:03.325
<i>which was bullshit.</i>

44:03.327 --> 44:05.427
<i>He was a good dad.</i>

44:05.429 --> 44:07.329
I do.

44:18.708 --> 44:20.775
Please state your name
for the record.

44:20.777 --> 44:22.844
Loretta Lassiter.

44:24.647 --> 44:27.649
<i>And you were married
to the victim.</i>

44:27.651 --> 44:30.518
- Yes.
- <i>And you are the mother of the defendant.</i>

44:30.520 --> 44:32.821
That's correct.

44:32.823 --> 44:34.422
Describe for me, please,

44:34.424 --> 44:36.891
the afternoon of
your husband's murder.

44:38.928 --> 44:41.329
Uh...

44:41.331 --> 44:45.934
It was a normal afternoon.

44:45.936 --> 44:48.737
It had rained earlier.

44:48.739 --> 44:50.672
Mike was at soccer practice,

44:50.674 --> 44:52.907
<i>or so I thought.</i>

44:52.909 --> 44:55.844
<i>So I worked out in our gym</i>

44:55.846 --> 44:57.879
<i>from 3:00 to 4:00.</i>

44:57.881 --> 45:00.415
<i>Were you expecting
your husband home?</i>

45:00.417 --> 45:04.286
<i>Yes, but I didn't know
what time.</i>

45:04.288 --> 45:05.987
<i>He always texted when he landed,</i>

45:05.989 --> 45:09.824
but I didn't hear it come in
when I was working out.

45:09.826 --> 45:12.761
<i>And where were you
when he did come home?</i>

45:12.763 --> 45:15.797
I was getting in the shower.

45:22.672 --> 45:24.639
And then?

45:26.309 --> 45:30.412
We exchanged a few words,

45:30.414 --> 45:32.447
and then I took my shower.

45:32.449 --> 45:34.616
A few words?

45:34.618 --> 45:36.685
What were they,
Mrs. Lassiter?

45:39.655 --> 45:42.324
I'd rather not say.

45:42.326 --> 45:44.092
You're under oath, ma'am.

45:53.002 --> 45:54.969
Mrs. Lassiter.

45:57.473 --> 46:01.743
He said some...

46:01.745 --> 46:04.512
Very vile things,

46:04.514 --> 46:08.116
and I'd rather leave it at that.

46:14.557 --> 46:17.726
What vile things did your
husband say, Mrs. Lassiter?

46:20.830 --> 46:21.863
<i>Mrs. Lassiter.</i>

46:21.865 --> 46:23.798
No.

46:25.835 --> 46:30.004
No. He was my husband.

46:30.006 --> 46:33.775
<i>I'm sure you got the picture
from Mr. Weston's testimony.</i>

46:33.777 --> 46:39.881
My husband could be
exceptionally cruel.

46:39.883 --> 46:44.552
You can cite me
for contempt if you like,

46:44.554 --> 46:47.655
but I'm not gonna repeat
what he said.

46:50.726 --> 46:53.061
Mr. Leblanc,
I'm willing to cite her.

46:53.063 --> 46:55.730
How do you wish to proceed?

46:55.732 --> 46:57.665
Let's see how it goes,
your honor.

46:57.667 --> 46:59.467
All right, Mrs. Lassiter,

46:59.469 --> 47:03.037
after your husband said
these vile things to you,

47:03.039 --> 47:04.039
then what happened?

47:07.410 --> 47:12.480
Like I said, I, um...
I took my shower.

47:12.482 --> 47:14.749
And...

47:14.751 --> 47:18.420
When I came out...

47:22.425 --> 47:26.728
Mike was in the doorway and...

47:26.730 --> 47:28.997
Is he dead?

47:28.999 --> 47:32.967
<i>He asked if
his father was dead.</i>

47:34.904 --> 47:39.007
I checked, and he was.

47:39.009 --> 47:41.576
And then Mike said...

47:50.019 --> 47:52.821
<i>What did Mike say,
Mrs. Lassiter?</i>

48:14.176 --> 48:15.910
<i>No, ma'am.</i>

48:15.912 --> 48:18.613
You need to answer
that question aloud.

48:31.994 --> 48:34.529
He said, "I did it."

48:39.735 --> 48:41.669
He said...

48:43.138 --> 48:44.706
I did it.

48:47.943 --> 48:49.177
I did it.

49:33.556 --> 49:36.758
Mrs. Lassiter,

49:36.760 --> 49:40.762
these vile things that
your husband said to you,

49:40.764 --> 49:42.063
did that happen often?

49:43.599 --> 49:46.100
I'm sorry. What?

49:46.102 --> 49:49.170
Did he verbally
abuse you frequently?

49:50.306 --> 49:53.608
Yes, it was frequent.

49:53.610 --> 49:55.877
<i>And was Mike
ever a witness to it?</i>

49:55.879 --> 49:59.013
Your honor, who's on trial here?

49:59.015 --> 50:01.115
Continue.

50:01.117 --> 50:04.619
We all lived under
the same roof.

50:04.621 --> 50:08.222
I'm sure he heard more
than I wish he had.

50:08.224 --> 50:11.059
<i>And was the abuse your
husband inflicted on you,</i>

50:11.061 --> 50:14.662
was it always only verbal?

50:14.664 --> 50:16.864
How do you mean?

50:16.866 --> 50:20.301
<i>Did Mike only hear vile things
your husband said,</i>

50:20.303 --> 50:25.206
or did he also see and hear
your husband hit you?

50:25.208 --> 50:27.308
Yes.

50:27.310 --> 50:29.744
- <i>Many times.</i>
- Yes.

50:29.746 --> 50:32.280
<i>And when was the last time?</i>

50:32.282 --> 50:33.948
The day he died.

50:33.950 --> 50:36.117
I'm sorry, judge.
This is absurd.

50:36.119 --> 50:38.052
I just asked the witness
about that day in question

50:38.054 --> 50:40.121
and she made no mention of it.

50:40.123 --> 50:42.156
Now, this testimony
has clearly been arranged

50:42.158 --> 50:43.958
and rehearsed
by defense counsel.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.760
Clearly? Even the part
where the witness said

50:45.762 --> 50:48.196
my client confessed to murder?

50:48.198 --> 50:51.232
Do you really want to impugn
this testimony, Mr. Leblanc?

50:51.234 --> 50:53.201
Okay, Mr. Ramsey,
but if there was abuse,

50:53.203 --> 50:54.802
where's the evidence, sir?

50:54.804 --> 50:57.205
A police report?
Anything, your honor?

50:57.207 --> 51:01.209
I have marked exhibits
a and b for identification.

51:01.211 --> 51:04.178
Photographs of injuries

51:04.180 --> 51:08.182
to Mrs. Lassiter on February 5th.

51:08.184 --> 51:12.253
As a courtesy, I am providing
a copy to the prosecution.

51:14.990 --> 51:17.425
- <i>May I approach the witness?</i>
- <i>Approach.</i>

51:19.995 --> 51:21.996
Mrs. Lassiter,

51:21.998 --> 51:23.865
<i>do you recognize
these documents?</i>

51:23.867 --> 51:25.199
Yes, I do.

51:25.201 --> 51:28.269
Do you recognize
the photographs?

51:28.271 --> 51:30.171
Yes.

51:30.173 --> 51:33.274
Were they taken the day
after your husband's death?

51:33.276 --> 51:34.942
Yes, they were.

51:34.944 --> 51:37.045
<i>Do the photographs
fairly and accurately</i>

51:37.047 --> 51:39.914
<i>depict the injuries inflicted
upon you by your husband</i>

51:39.916 --> 51:43.084
- <i>prior to his death?</i>
- Yes, they do.

51:45.154 --> 51:47.722
<i>For the record,</i>

51:47.724 --> 51:51.426
<i>the defense's exhibit a and b,</i>

51:51.428 --> 51:54.295
<i>I hereby admit into evidence.</i>

51:54.297 --> 51:55.697
<i>Loretta would have
said anything</i>

51:55.699 --> 51:57.165
<i>to get Mike acquitted,</i>

51:57.167 --> 52:00.068
<i>but the idea was
to keep her on track,</i>

52:00.070 --> 52:02.036
<i>get her to say things
that proved</i>

52:02.038 --> 52:03.871
<i>Mike had witnessed Boone's abuse</i>

52:03.873 --> 52:05.773
<i>and was defending her from it.</i>

52:08.310 --> 52:11.879
<i>And she did it, in spades.</i>

52:19.722 --> 52:21.489
Those photos...

52:21.491 --> 52:23.891
Why were you holding out on me?

52:23.893 --> 52:26.294
I saw 'em for
the first time last night.

52:26.296 --> 52:28.029
They're keeping us alive.

52:29.965 --> 52:31.466
<i>Now what?</i>

52:31.468 --> 52:33.801
I'm thinking of resting.

52:33.803 --> 52:35.303
What?

52:35.305 --> 52:38.740
Thanks. Shit.

52:47.950 --> 52:51.519
No way am I putting you up there.

52:51.521 --> 52:53.354
Never put a witness on the stand

52:53.356 --> 52:55.323
unless you know what
they're going to say.

52:55.325 --> 52:56.891
You know that.

52:58.927 --> 53:00.962
That's not happening.

53:12.941 --> 53:16.444
This right? You're not
his lawyer anymore?

53:19.815 --> 53:21.482
Give us one second, okay?

53:27.356 --> 53:32.293
Mike, we have half
a chance of winning here.

53:32.295 --> 53:35.129
Why would you
blow it now? Huh?

53:37.533 --> 53:40.234
<i>This was a fucking disaster.</i>

53:40.236 --> 53:42.470
<i>I had no way of knowing
what Mike would say,</i>

53:42.472 --> 53:44.572
<i>no way to prepare,
and he knew it.</i>

53:44.574 --> 53:46.541
<i>Normally if a client
refused to speak to me,</i>

53:46.543 --> 53:49.243
<i>I'd order a psychiatric
evaluation.</i>

53:49.245 --> 53:51.913
<i>But Mike wasn't crazy.</i>

53:51.915 --> 53:55.483
<i>He just didn't trust anyone,
including me.</i>

53:57.319 --> 54:00.121
It's not true, is it?

54:00.123 --> 54:02.256
You're putting him on?

54:02.258 --> 54:03.991
But that's crazy.

54:03.993 --> 54:05.326
Ramsey, you promised me.

54:05.328 --> 54:07.195
You think I don't know?
You think I like it?

54:07.197 --> 54:09.330
And if we don't put him on,
he's gonna fire Ramsey.

54:09.332 --> 54:11.299
Why are you talking?

54:11.301 --> 54:14.068
This is between me
and my lawyer.

54:17.005 --> 54:19.006
- Ramsey.
- Listen to me.

54:20.542 --> 54:23.010
I can't keep him
from testifying.

54:23.012 --> 54:25.847
It's his constitutional right,

54:25.849 --> 54:29.083
and he knows that.

54:29.085 --> 54:32.253
He knows that, okay?

54:36.426 --> 54:39.427
<i>The only time
I'd used "defense of others"</i>

54:39.429 --> 54:42.163
<i>was a barroom brawl
where my client intervened</i>

54:42.165 --> 54:45.399
<i>between two guys fighting
and shot one in the head.</i>

54:47.035 --> 54:48.402
<i>I lost.</i>

54:55.344 --> 54:57.178
<i>It's hard for
a jury to understand</i>

54:57.180 --> 54:58.579
<i>how the intent to kill</i>

54:58.581 --> 55:01.883
<i>can be formed
on behalf of another.</i>

55:01.885 --> 55:05.119
<i>They always see it
as two against one.</i>

55:13.595 --> 55:15.897
<i>Mr. Ramsey,</i>

55:15.899 --> 55:18.165
<i>you declined your opening
statement at the start of trial.</i>

55:18.167 --> 55:21.068
You have another
opportunity now.

55:21.070 --> 55:22.470
May I, your honor?

55:28.343 --> 55:29.911
Your honor, my client insists

55:29.913 --> 55:32.046
on taking the stand
against my wishes.

55:32.048 --> 55:33.681
Since I have no idea
what he's going to say,

55:33.683 --> 55:35.383
I have to waive
my opening again.

55:36.985 --> 55:38.352
My sympathies.

55:40.489 --> 55:42.056
Deputies.

55:52.634 --> 55:55.469
<i>Mr. Ramsey, a question?</i>

56:06.381 --> 56:08.950
Please state your name
for the record.

56:08.952 --> 56:11.252
I'm Michael Lassiter.

56:11.254 --> 56:14.055
Michael, is it true
you haven't spoken

56:14.057 --> 56:15.723
since the day of
your father's death?

56:15.725 --> 56:17.558
Yes.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.493
Why is that?

56:19.495 --> 56:20.594
I don't know.

56:20.596 --> 56:22.530
You have no idea at all?

56:22.532 --> 56:23.531
<i>None.</i>

56:23.533 --> 56:24.999
But my father did teach me

56:25.001 --> 56:27.969
that I have the right
to remain silent.

56:27.971 --> 56:30.705
So, why are you speaking now?

56:30.707 --> 56:33.541
To tell the truth
about who he was.

56:33.543 --> 56:36.010
<i>There's been some
testimony about</i>

56:36.012 --> 56:40.214
your father's treatment
of your mother.

56:40.216 --> 56:42.316
Is that testimony accurate?

56:42.318 --> 56:44.585
Yeah, I'm afraid so, yes.

56:44.587 --> 56:45.686
You witnessed it?

56:45.688 --> 56:50.591
Not all of it, obviously.

56:50.593 --> 56:54.028
But, he was cruel to my mom
in ways that were horrifying.

56:54.030 --> 56:56.597
<i>And he'd call her stupid,</i>

56:56.599 --> 56:59.033
call her ugly.

56:59.035 --> 57:01.702
What about physical abuse?

57:01.704 --> 57:03.270
Did you see that?

57:05.440 --> 57:06.774
No.

57:06.776 --> 57:08.709
No, but I did... I heard noises.

57:08.711 --> 57:11.746
Your honor, noises...

57:11.748 --> 57:13.414
<i>Continue.</i>

57:15.083 --> 57:18.552
I heard things, and I saw them.

57:18.554 --> 57:21.022
What I heard was, you know,

57:21.024 --> 57:23.624
the sound of a hand
hitting flesh,

57:23.626 --> 57:26.660
and then I'd hear my mom cry out.

57:26.662 --> 57:30.464
And the next day she'd be
wearing a turtleneck

57:30.466 --> 57:32.333
even though it was
the middle of July,

57:32.335 --> 57:35.469
or she wouldn't even come
out of her room at all.

57:35.471 --> 57:38.539
The day your father died...

57:38.541 --> 57:41.575
<i>You got home early</i>

57:41.577 --> 57:45.479
<i>because soccer
practice was canceled.</i>

57:45.481 --> 57:46.480
<i>Yeah, that's correct.</i>

57:46.482 --> 57:48.149
Mom?

57:48.151 --> 57:51.452
<i>Came home, heard them
in their bedroom.</i>

57:51.454 --> 57:53.687
- <i>When you...</i>
- That's not why I did it.

58:01.329 --> 58:02.830
Tell the jury why, Mike.

58:08.171 --> 58:09.804
It was the trip.

58:09.806 --> 58:12.173
Something happened on the trip?

58:14.409 --> 58:15.776
<i>What happened, Mike?</i>

58:17.446 --> 58:18.779
<i>Michael?</i>

58:24.719 --> 58:27.188
I'm really just really stupid.

58:27.190 --> 58:28.789
I thought it'd stopped.

58:28.791 --> 58:31.492
What? What had stopped?

58:31.494 --> 58:33.194
There was a door.

58:33.196 --> 58:34.728
There was a privacy door
on the plane,

58:34.730 --> 58:38.566
and my dad pulled it.

58:38.568 --> 58:41.235
We had privacy,
if you want to call it that.

58:42.871 --> 58:44.805
He knew.

58:44.807 --> 58:48.242
He knew once I went off
to college,

58:48.244 --> 58:49.710
he wouldn't be able
to do it anymore.

58:49.712 --> 58:52.279
Do what, Mike?

58:55.517 --> 58:56.650
Rape me?

58:58.820 --> 58:59.820
I'm sorry?

59:02.757 --> 59:05.559
He wouldn't be able
to rape me anymore.

59:19.674 --> 59:23.210
<i>You know, I loved my dad once.</i>

59:23.212 --> 59:25.713
I loved him.

59:25.715 --> 59:29.517
I would've done anything,
anything to win his approval.

59:34.322 --> 59:37.258
When...

59:37.260 --> 59:39.693
<i>When did this start, Mike?</i>

59:41.863 --> 59:44.165
When I was 12.

59:44.167 --> 59:46.167
<i>It started when I was 12.</i>

59:47.869 --> 59:52.306
Where was the flight
attendant during all this?

59:52.308 --> 59:54.742
I don't remember.
I don't know.

59:54.744 --> 59:58.746
Mike, this...

59:58.748 --> 01:00:03.317
This abuse,

01:00:03.319 --> 01:00:05.252
did you ever tell
anyone about it?

01:00:09.224 --> 01:00:10.724
No.

01:00:10.726 --> 01:00:12.693
No, I was ashamed.

01:00:34.482 --> 01:00:36.650
Mike, when you got home
on the day of the murder,

01:00:36.652 --> 01:00:38.752
and you went into
your parents' bedroom,

01:00:38.754 --> 01:00:40.421
what was your father doing?

01:00:40.423 --> 01:00:43.591
I guess he was about to unpack.

01:00:43.593 --> 01:00:46.327
<i>So, there was no immediate threat
from him to you?</i>

01:00:46.329 --> 01:00:48.862
He told me to be ready.

01:00:48.864 --> 01:00:50.931
On the plane, he said that
when we got back to the house,

01:00:50.933 --> 01:00:52.900
that he'd do it again
before I went off to college.

01:00:52.902 --> 01:00:55.402
Okay, but was he threatening you

01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:57.972
with abuse at that moment?

01:00:57.974 --> 01:00:59.807
He was always threatening me.

01:00:59.809 --> 01:01:02.343
It was what he did.
It was who he was.

01:01:02.345 --> 01:01:05.312
Michael, were you in
imminent danger right then?

01:01:05.314 --> 01:01:06.947
Yes, at that very moment.

01:01:06.949 --> 01:01:08.282
Yes, he was threatening me.

01:01:08.284 --> 01:01:09.550
He was always threatening me.

01:01:09.552 --> 01:01:13.554
- Yes or no, son?
- Yes.

01:01:13.556 --> 01:01:14.922
Yes.

01:01:28.436 --> 01:01:30.404
No further questions.

01:01:40.882 --> 01:01:43.384
Leblanc is gonna recall
Angela Morley.

01:01:43.386 --> 01:01:45.719
He's having deluxe reroute her
here tomorrow morning.

01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:46.954
- Shit.
- Yeah.

01:01:46.956 --> 01:01:49.290
But you got bigger problems.

01:01:49.292 --> 01:01:51.725
You were hard on that flight
attendant first time out.

01:01:51.727 --> 01:01:54.428
You lay into her
again like that?

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:58.599
- But you do got one option.
- What's that?

01:01:58.601 --> 01:02:01.435
Let her do it.

01:02:01.437 --> 01:02:04.571
That's true.

01:02:04.573 --> 01:02:08.309
<i>I felt bad for giving
the kid such a hard time.</i>

01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:11.445
<i>If he'd told me about his
father's abuse before the trial,</i>

01:02:11.447 --> 01:02:13.714
<i>I would've built
the whole case on it</i>

01:02:13.716 --> 01:02:16.750
<i>and Leblanc would've
torn it apart.</i>

01:02:16.752 --> 01:02:18.652
<i>So he held back.</i>

01:02:20.689 --> 01:02:22.022
<i>It would come down
to Mike's word</i>

01:02:22.024 --> 01:02:24.625
<i>against Angela Morley's,</i>

01:02:24.627 --> 01:02:28.062
<i>which must've been
his plan all along.</i>

01:02:28.064 --> 01:02:30.898
<i>So, you'd either be there
or with the passengers.</i>

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.466
<i>Yes.</i>

01:02:32.468 --> 01:02:34.768
<i>And does your alcove
have a door?</i>

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:38.605
Yes, there's a door I can close
for privacy on request.

01:02:38.607 --> 01:02:40.774
Was it closed at all during
this flight?

01:02:40.776 --> 01:02:42.776
No.

01:02:42.778 --> 01:02:45.879
<i>So you could see
Mike and Boone Lassiter</i>

01:02:45.881 --> 01:02:47.381
<i>for the whole six hours?</i>

01:02:47.383 --> 01:02:49.917
Yes. Of course.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:57.024
Miss Morley, did Boone Lassiter
sexually molest his son

01:02:57.026 --> 01:02:59.093
at any point during that flight?

01:02:59.095 --> 01:03:00.761
Certainly not.

01:03:00.763 --> 01:03:03.664
Did he touch him
inappropriately?

01:03:03.666 --> 01:03:04.865
Did he do anything worse?

01:03:04.867 --> 01:03:06.467
No.

01:03:06.469 --> 01:03:07.768
You would've noticed that.

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:08.969
I would've done more
than noticed,

01:03:08.971 --> 01:03:10.704
I would've stopped him.

01:03:10.706 --> 01:03:14.074
No, Mr. Lassiter never did
anything like that.

01:03:19.681 --> 01:03:22.950
- Thank you.
- Ask about Ginsburg.

01:03:22.952 --> 01:03:24.651
<i>Your witness.</i>

01:03:38.933 --> 01:03:43.003
Miss Morley, how many flights
a week do you work?

01:03:43.005 --> 01:03:47.708
It varies. Sometimes one or two,
sometimes a dozen.

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:50.544
That week in late January,

01:03:50.546 --> 01:03:53.580
do you remember
how many you flew?

01:03:53.582 --> 01:03:55.983
It was busy.
I remember that much.

01:03:57.886 --> 01:04:02.856
So, you were flying a lot.

01:04:02.858 --> 01:04:05.826
That must be tiring.

01:04:05.828 --> 01:04:07.895
Do you have a question,
miss Brady?

01:04:15.003 --> 01:04:17.504
Do you ever doze off
on a flight?

01:04:17.506 --> 01:04:20.774
I pride myself on staying awake.
That's my job.

01:04:20.776 --> 01:04:23.577
I carry Adderall and Provigil
just in case.

01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:25.712
I have them right here.

01:04:37.025 --> 01:04:38.492
Tell me, miss Morley,

01:04:38.494 --> 01:04:40.861
who were the pilots
on that flight from L.A?

01:04:40.863 --> 01:04:43.831
Captain green
and copilot Ginsburg.

01:04:46.668 --> 01:04:49.169
Did you spend time
in the cockpit with them?

01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:52.940
Maybe. Maybe a minute or so.

01:04:52.942 --> 01:04:55.609
<i>Do you fly with them a lot,</i>

01:04:55.611 --> 01:04:57.744
<i>green and Ginsburg?</i>

01:04:57.746 --> 01:05:00.914
Yes. We're kind of a crew team.

01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:03.951
So, if you stay
overnight somewhere,

01:05:03.953 --> 01:05:06.053
the company puts y'all up
in the same hotel?

01:05:08.256 --> 01:05:09.823
Yes.

01:05:12.861 --> 01:05:16.263
Do you socialize
on these layovers?

01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:19.199
How do you mean?

01:05:19.201 --> 01:05:21.869
<i>Are you friends with the pilots?</i>

01:05:21.871 --> 01:05:24.137
Sure. We're friendly.

01:05:27.542 --> 01:05:30.911
Isn't it true you're in a personal
relationship with copilot Ginsburg?

01:05:30.913 --> 01:05:32.746
<i>Objection, your honor.</i>

01:05:32.748 --> 01:05:34.681
Where's defense counsel
headed with this?

01:05:34.683 --> 01:05:37.551
Miss Brady, I don't follow
this line of questioning.

01:05:37.553 --> 01:05:42.155
Judge, if she has a personal
relationship with copilot Ginsburg,

01:05:42.157 --> 01:05:47.961
it may be worth calling him
to hear his recollections,

01:05:47.963 --> 01:05:50.230
<i>what was discussed,</i>

01:05:50.232 --> 01:05:52.900
what they talked about.

01:05:52.902 --> 01:05:54.868
<i>I'll allow it.</i>

01:06:00.675 --> 01:06:02.976
I don't know.

01:06:02.978 --> 01:06:07.080
I don't know how much
time I was up there.

01:06:08.983 --> 01:06:10.817
<i>Thinking back on it,
that flight,</i>

01:06:10.819 --> 01:06:16.256
it could've been as much as...

01:06:16.258 --> 01:06:17.258
10 minutes.

01:06:19.861 --> 01:06:22.963
Only 10 minutes?

01:06:22.965 --> 01:06:24.064
Or longer?

01:06:30.605 --> 01:06:32.606
It could've been longer.
I'm not sure.

01:06:34.008 --> 01:06:36.610
More than once
during the flight?

01:06:40.114 --> 01:06:42.149
Possibly.

01:06:42.151 --> 01:06:45.919
Thank you, miss Morley.

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:56.763
<i>You're excused.</i>

01:07:02.604 --> 01:07:04.805
Here, give me that, sugar.
I'll run it down for you.

01:07:04.807 --> 01:07:06.373
When'd you send her
to poker school?

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.308
- Wasn't so bad.
- No, it was not.

01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:10.377
Did you see her spot that
wedding ring?

01:07:10.379 --> 01:07:12.913
You wouldn't have spotted
that wedding ring, Richie.

01:07:12.915 --> 01:07:16.116
I told you there's a reason
why we have women lawyers.

01:07:16.118 --> 01:07:17.884
I'll catch y'all tomorrow.

01:07:20.822 --> 01:07:22.289
What's the matter?

01:07:26.294 --> 01:07:29.162
What if she's not lying?

01:07:30.832 --> 01:07:32.866
Don't get carried away
with yourself.

01:07:32.868 --> 01:07:35.669
You said everybody lies, right?

01:07:35.671 --> 01:07:37.804
Doesn't everybody include Mike?

01:07:37.806 --> 01:07:41.108
He testified.
That's our defense, okay?

01:07:42.844 --> 01:07:45.312
I'm going to the hotel,
work on my closing.

01:07:45.314 --> 01:07:47.047
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:07:49.283 --> 01:07:50.951
Nice job.

01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:17.077
Can I bum one of those?

01:08:25.118 --> 01:08:28.388
Nice job in there.

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:29.823
Thanks.

01:08:32.026 --> 01:08:35.696
That must've been
really hard to hear.

01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:45.305
Did you have any idea
what Mike was gonna say?

01:08:45.307 --> 01:08:47.774
Of course I didn't know.

01:08:47.776 --> 01:08:49.843
I stayed up all night thinking,

01:08:49.845 --> 01:08:51.845
"how could I not see it?"

01:08:54.448 --> 01:08:58.417
Is it possible he's...

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.453
Not saying what really happened?

01:09:01.923 --> 01:09:03.990
Why would he do that?

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:09.162
It was a terrible
situation you were in,

01:09:09.163 --> 01:09:11.430
both of you.

01:09:11.433 --> 01:09:14.835
<i>No one would blame
either of you.</i>

01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:22.142
I think maybe
Mike wanted to protect you.

01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:30.350
I did it. I did it.

01:09:30.352 --> 01:09:31.885
No, no, Mikey.

01:09:31.886 --> 01:09:33.019
- Mom, listen to me.
- No, Mikey, honey.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.421
Mom, listen to me, please.

01:09:34.423 --> 01:09:36.288
- This is the only way.
- This is my mistake.

01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:37.924
- Mom, I did it. Mom!
- I did it. No, Mikey, no!

01:09:37.926 --> 01:09:42.929
Well, I don't know
what you think you know,

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.232
but your theory's wrong.

01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:49.935
Wait.

01:09:49.938 --> 01:09:55.208
Your job is to represent my son.

01:10:25.173 --> 01:10:27.007
Did she phone you?

01:10:30.578 --> 01:10:35.315
Ramsey, did Loretta call?

01:10:35.317 --> 01:10:36.817
Yeah.

01:10:40.188 --> 01:10:43.123
Did she tell you what I said?

01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:45.192
Yeah.

01:10:45.194 --> 01:10:48.595
She wants me to fire you.

01:10:48.597 --> 01:10:50.430
I told her no way,

01:10:50.432 --> 01:10:53.099
not after what you did in court.

01:10:55.036 --> 01:10:57.838
It's just normal craziness
at the end of a trial.

01:10:59.307 --> 01:11:00.607
Don't worry about it.

01:11:00.609 --> 01:11:02.008
I accused her
of killing her husband,

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:04.344
did she mention that?

01:11:04.346 --> 01:11:06.479
Yes, she did.

01:11:12.086 --> 01:11:14.254
What if Mike
didn't stab his father

01:11:14.256 --> 01:11:15.555
and our defense is a lie, too?

01:11:15.557 --> 01:11:18.992
He wasn't molested.

01:11:18.994 --> 01:11:21.428
Yeah.

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:22.863
Yeah?

01:11:24.899 --> 01:11:28.401
Yeah.
That might be true.

01:11:28.403 --> 01:11:32.005
I don't know, or care.

01:11:33.608 --> 01:11:36.877
All I know is I have a chance
to get this boy acquitted.

01:11:49.924 --> 01:11:51.591
It's like you're protecting her.

01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:59.065
I have to work on
my closing argument now.

01:11:59.067 --> 01:12:02.035
Did you know?

01:12:02.037 --> 01:12:03.937
'Cause if you knew
and you're protecting her...

01:12:03.939 --> 01:12:06.339
Wait, back up, okay?

01:12:06.341 --> 01:12:09.075
I asked for your help in keeping
this boy out of prison.

01:12:10.945 --> 01:12:13.313
Are you going to do
what you promised me,

01:12:13.315 --> 01:12:16.249
represent our client, Mike?

01:12:16.251 --> 01:12:18.385
He shouldn't even be on trial.

01:12:18.387 --> 01:12:22.088
You don't know that
'cause you weren't there.

01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:25.392
Who are you representing here,
Mike or Loretta?

01:12:25.394 --> 01:12:28.361
Okay, now you're scaring me.

01:12:28.363 --> 01:12:30.230
This is not about Loretta.

01:12:30.232 --> 01:12:32.966
- This is about you.
- What?

01:12:32.968 --> 01:12:34.935
Is Loretta a trigger for you?

01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:38.605
Is this what got you fired
from your firm?

01:12:44.211 --> 01:12:46.346
- What are you doing?
- Good luck, Ramsey.

01:12:46.348 --> 01:12:47.714
Where are you going?

01:12:50.384 --> 01:12:54.487
You're leaving?
Now, you promised me.

01:12:54.489 --> 01:12:57.223
What about the jury?
What about Mike?

01:12:57.225 --> 01:12:58.491
<i>The impact on the jury</i>

01:12:58.493 --> 01:13:00.160
<i>of seeing someone they trust</i>

01:13:00.162 --> 01:13:01.962
<i>leave the defense table
cannot be measured.</i>

01:13:01.964 --> 01:13:03.596
You're a lawyer, Janelle!

01:13:03.598 --> 01:13:06.266
<i>I just hoped Walter Brady's
brilliant daughter</i>

01:13:06.268 --> 01:13:08.134
<i>could get her mind around that.</i>

01:13:15.376 --> 01:13:18.278
<i>At some point, every defense
lawyer has to choose</i>

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.746
<i>between his own need
to know the truth</i>

01:13:19.748 --> 01:13:22.349
<i>and the best interests
of his client.</i>

01:13:29.323 --> 01:13:30.724
<i>But I was more worried
about Janelle</i>

01:13:30.726 --> 01:13:32.759
<i>than I needed to be.</i>

01:13:48.676 --> 01:13:50.176
<i>All rise.</i>

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:59.452
<i>Sometimes things erupt.</i>

01:13:59.454 --> 01:14:02.322
It's called a trigger,

01:14:02.324 --> 01:14:04.524
a trigger to violence.

01:14:10.431 --> 01:14:13.700
Mike Lassiter was sulking
on the plane home,

01:14:13.702 --> 01:14:17.637
and two days later, he erupted.

01:14:17.639 --> 01:14:19.739
That is what happened here.

01:14:19.741 --> 01:14:22.208
It wasn't abuse.

01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:24.110
You heard the flight attendant.

01:14:24.112 --> 01:14:26.146
Nothing happened on that plane,

01:14:26.148 --> 01:14:27.647
and if nothing happened then,

01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:30.483
how do we know
any of it happened?

01:14:30.485 --> 01:14:33.219
Where's the evidence?

01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:36.356
The defendant is supposed
to be a legal prodigy,

01:14:36.358 --> 01:14:39.492
yet there's no evidence,
nothing.

01:14:39.494 --> 01:14:43.797
No physical evidence
to support his defense.

01:14:43.799 --> 01:14:46.533
There is nothing.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.349
Michael Lassiter
acted with malice,

01:15:03.351 --> 01:15:06.419
deliberate premeditation,

01:15:06.421 --> 01:15:08.788
and an intent to kill.

01:15:12.827 --> 01:15:16.563
Do your duty. Guilty.

01:15:16.565 --> 01:15:20.500
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

01:15:30.377 --> 01:15:33.413
Thank you.

01:15:33.415 --> 01:15:38.284
<i>Yes, Michael Lassiter
killed his father.</i>

01:15:38.286 --> 01:15:42.355
That is not a fact in dispute.

01:15:42.357 --> 01:15:47.861
All that remains
for you to decide is why.

01:15:50.131 --> 01:15:53.299
<i>You heard Michael say</i>

01:15:53.301 --> 01:15:56.569
that he would do anything,

01:15:56.571 --> 01:15:59.539
anything to win the
approval of his father.

01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:03.776
<i>So why?</i>

01:16:03.778 --> 01:16:07.580
I asked Michael
if it was the abuse

01:16:07.582 --> 01:16:11.584
inflicted on his mother
by his father,

01:16:11.586 --> 01:16:14.454
and Michael said no.

01:16:14.456 --> 01:16:17.423
<i>No.</i>

01:16:17.425 --> 01:16:22.729
Then Michael told,
for the first time,

01:16:22.731 --> 01:16:25.698
something he had never
uttered in his life.

01:16:29.737 --> 01:16:31.704
That his father abused him...

01:16:34.208 --> 01:16:37.844
<i>violated him repeatedly.</i>

01:16:39.847 --> 01:16:42.615
<i>And that when his father</i>

01:16:42.617 --> 01:16:45.885
<i>had threatened him on the plane</i>

01:16:45.887 --> 01:16:51.491
<i>to do this again
before he went to college,</i>

01:16:51.493 --> 01:16:57.497
something in Michael said no.

01:16:57.499 --> 01:16:58.898
No more.

01:17:01.835 --> 01:17:07.507
I ask you to do the just
and right thing.

01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:12.345
Send this boy back home
with his mother.

01:17:12.347 --> 01:17:15.815
<i>Find the defendant not guilty...</i>

01:17:18.252 --> 01:17:20.620
and release him
from this nightmare.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.507
<i>I think it hurt
Boone's feelings</i>

01:17:41.509 --> 01:17:43.309
<i>when I stayed in
criminal defense</i>

01:17:43.311 --> 01:17:46.779
<i>instead of moving into
personal injury with him,</i>

01:17:46.781 --> 01:17:48.681
<i>but he never said so,</i>

01:17:48.683 --> 01:17:50.650
<i>claimed it was good
to have someone to call</i>

01:17:50.652 --> 01:17:52.485
<i>if he ever got a DUI.</i>

01:17:54.755 --> 01:17:57.523
<i>He bought me my first nice suit,</i>

01:17:57.525 --> 01:18:01.661
<i>reminded me to shower
every day and get a haircut.</i>

01:18:04.298 --> 01:18:06.366
<i>He knew where I came from.</i>

01:18:08.302 --> 01:18:09.669
Jury's in.

01:18:22.316 --> 01:18:24.517
Michael.

01:18:24.519 --> 01:18:26.619
Whatever happens here,

01:18:26.621 --> 01:18:29.856
there's still things
we can do, okay?

01:18:29.858 --> 01:18:32.458
What, like appeal?

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.761
Thanks a lot.

01:18:55.649 --> 01:18:57.383
One question.

01:18:57.385 --> 01:18:59.652
Did dad really hit you?

01:19:01.789 --> 01:19:03.990
Of course he did, Mikey.

01:19:11.498 --> 01:19:13.032
<i>All rise.</i>

01:19:21.642 --> 01:19:23.409
Bring 'em in.

01:19:39.893 --> 01:19:43.062
<i>Jury, have you reached
a verdict?</i>

01:19:43.064 --> 01:19:44.664
<i>We have.</i>

01:19:44.666 --> 01:19:46.866
Bailiff.

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:51.104
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:19:55.943 --> 01:19:59.412
- <i>Is it unanimous?</i>
- <i>It is.</i>

01:19:59.414 --> 01:20:02.048
- <i>I did it.</i>
- <i>No, no, honey...</i>

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:03.549
<i>Mom, listen to me, please.</i>

01:20:03.551 --> 01:20:04.951
- This is the only way.
- This is my mistake.

01:20:04.953 --> 01:20:06.452
- I did it.
- Mom, I did it.

01:20:06.454 --> 01:20:09.555
No, Mikey, no.
No, I won't let you!

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.395
Please hurry.
It's my husband.

01:20:30.010 --> 01:20:32.845
<i>Jury, what say you?</i>

01:20:32.847 --> 01:20:35.982
<i>On the charge
of first degree murder,</i>

01:20:35.984 --> 01:20:39.018
<i>we find the defendant...</i>

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:42.455
<i>Not guilty.</i>

01:20:42.457 --> 01:20:43.723
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:20:43.725 --> 01:20:45.725
<i>this concludes the trial.</i>

01:20:45.727 --> 01:20:48.861
<i>I'd like to thank you
for your service.</i>

01:20:48.863 --> 01:20:51.129
<i>The jury is dismissed.</i>

01:21:00.841 --> 01:21:02.575
Meet me after court.

01:21:04.845 --> 01:21:06.746
Come on,
let's go get your things.

01:21:19.693 --> 01:21:21.093
Thank you.

01:21:30.537 --> 01:21:31.838
Will Mike come out here?

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.840
I think he wants
to talk to me first.

01:21:33.842 --> 01:21:35.208
Okay.

01:21:37.077 --> 01:21:39.846
<i>The jury believed Mike,</i>

01:21:39.848 --> 01:21:43.850
<i>ignored the facts and the law,</i>

01:21:43.852 --> 01:21:45.751
<i>did what they knew was right.</i>

01:21:47.654 --> 01:21:48.788
How does it feel?

01:21:54.728 --> 01:21:56.229
What's this?

01:21:56.231 --> 01:21:58.598
It's your watch.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.033
It's on the rug.

01:22:01.035 --> 01:22:05.771
You were there in their bedroom
before my dad came home.

01:22:07.741 --> 01:22:10.209
Honey...

01:22:22.122 --> 01:22:24.257
You were there,
and you killed him.

01:22:25.793 --> 01:22:28.661
Just tell me
you killed my father.

01:22:28.663 --> 01:22:32.798
Mike, you know
I'd never do that.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.800
Never kill him
or never admit it?

01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:40.106
I'm gonna tell
the D.A everything.

01:22:40.108 --> 01:22:41.574
Tell him what, Mike?

01:22:41.576 --> 01:22:43.676
That you saw a watch?

01:22:45.078 --> 01:22:46.812
There's no evidence.

01:22:48.248 --> 01:22:51.250
They can't prosecute
anyone else,

01:22:51.252 --> 01:22:52.685
and they all pointed to you.

01:22:52.687 --> 01:22:57.290
Graves, the coroner,
they swore under oath.

01:22:57.292 --> 01:22:59.725
You swore under oath.

01:22:59.727 --> 01:23:01.294
I didn't trash Boone's memory

01:23:01.296 --> 01:23:03.763
and brand myself a killer
raped by his father...

01:23:03.765 --> 01:23:04.897
I didn't do that to save you!

01:23:04.899 --> 01:23:07.700
- Answer me!
- No!

01:23:12.673 --> 01:23:14.840
You won't let me go to prison?

01:23:14.842 --> 01:23:16.275
You're not going
to prison, Mike.

01:23:16.277 --> 01:23:18.878
It's all over. You're free.

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.746
Now what?

01:23:26.887 --> 01:23:29.755
He was destroying her...

01:23:31.358 --> 01:23:32.992
and you know it.

01:23:36.063 --> 01:23:38.731
Even Alex knew.

01:23:50.043 --> 01:23:51.811
Your mom's out there.

01:23:54.381 --> 01:23:56.182
She's waiting for you.

01:24:33.687 --> 01:24:34.687
Can I?

01:25:01.381 --> 01:25:02.381
Thank you.

01:25:05.752 --> 01:25:07.119
I'll see you.

01:25:32.946 --> 01:25:35.781
Hey.

01:25:35.783 --> 01:25:37.850
What are you doing here?

01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:52.264
My wife is having an affair.

01:25:54.167 --> 01:25:56.268
Boone.

01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:58.404
Please.

01:25:58.406 --> 01:25:59.505
Seriously?

01:26:02.175 --> 01:26:03.843
So what do I do?

01:26:06.446 --> 01:26:09.315
I don't know.

01:26:09.317 --> 01:26:10.783
Divorce her, I guess.

01:26:10.785 --> 01:26:14.987
Come on, Ramsey.

01:26:14.989 --> 01:26:17.890
You know I can't do that.

01:26:17.892 --> 01:26:20.025
You know Loretta.

01:26:22.362 --> 01:26:24.497
She won't live without me.

01:26:29.102 --> 01:26:33.038
"Oh, I'd find you. With my money,
you could count on it."

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.142
And then he'd laugh
like it was a joke.

01:26:36.144 --> 01:26:37.843

01:27:42.143 --> 01:27:46.846

01:27:46.848 --> 01:27:48.347
