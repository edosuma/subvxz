[narrator]
<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek: Discovery:

00:14.014 --> 00:15.890
[Burnham] Identify space-time location!

00:15.974 --> 00:19.686
You have reached Year 3188.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.772
[Burnham] The Federation, as we know it,
disappeared overnight,

00:22.856 --> 00:24.566
but I did find part of a transmission.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.443
[Tal] <i>This is Admiral Senna Tal.</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:28.027
<i>The Federation lives on.</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:30.238
I am Admiral Tal.

00:30.739 --> 00:35.076
[Saru] Although human, young Adira
has been joined with a Trill symbiont.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.786
Welcome to the circle.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.288
[Saru] Once they join with a host,

00:38.371 --> 00:42.208
that host has the ability to access
the memories of all former hosts.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.960
[Burnham] Including Admiral Tal's?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.086
That's beautiful.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.088
-What is it?
-A lullaby.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.095
-Are you okay?
-No, obviously.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.182
What the hell are you doing here,
besides saving their asses?

00:57.265 --> 00:58.308
[Nhan] I stayed for Airiam.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.771
She's a science officer,
but she paid the price of a soldier.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.397
I felt like someone should honor that.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.900
I am grateful for your support
of my captaincy.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.694
It would be my privilege
to be your Number One.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.614
[Adira] Senna knew the algorithm you need
to find Federation headquarters.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.909
-These coordinates...
-They'll take you where you need to go.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.248
[Saru] <i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

01:22.957 --> 01:25.627
<i>After a journey of 930 years,</i>

01:25.710 --> 01:28.963
<i>and a return to Earth</i>
<i>that we could not have anticipated,</i>

01:29.047 --> 01:32.967
<i>we are finally on the verge</i>
<i>of reaching our destination,</i>

01:33.051 --> 01:35.762
<i>Federation and Starfleet headquarters,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:39.557
<i>separate entities</i>
<i>that must now abide together.</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:43.228
<i>A sign of this new time, I suppose.</i>

01:44.145 --> 01:50.652
<i>I can only hope that they are as eager</i>
<i>for us to arrive as we are to be home.</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:52.695
[Burnham] Captain.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.323
Number One.

01:57.742 --> 02:01.287
Every report, record and log you asked for
is ready to be handed over to Starfleet.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.332
Words aren't enough...

02:05.708 --> 02:06.626
are they?

02:09.295 --> 02:11.047
Nine hundred and thirty years.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.176
I trust that what matters most
will have endured.

02:16.052 --> 02:19.556
I know that there will be protocol,
that we'll have a lot of questions,

02:20.181 --> 02:21.182
about the Burn.

02:22.350 --> 02:27.272
But there are other things
that I'd like to inquire about as well.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.068
You are thinking about your mother.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.403
Yes, sir.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.283
I know that I'm lucky
to have someone to hope for.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.244
I believe that here...

02:41.995 --> 02:43.329
there are answers for you.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.374
And solace for all of us.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.210
[Burnham] I really hope so, sir.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.382
Lieutenant Detmer, status report.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.509
Captain, we're here.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.844
Federation headquarters.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.060
Must be some kind of distortion field.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.980
It is a security measure
designed to mask their location,

03:09.063 --> 03:11.316
but they're expecting us.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.568
-You may proceed.
-Aye, sir.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.769
[all gasping]

03:53.942 --> 03:55.193
Wow.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.781
-We wouldn't have made it without you.
-Without everybody.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.208
[Burnham] Fascinating.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.960
The field seems to be sustained

04:12.043 --> 04:14.462
by the collective energy
of every ship within it.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.757
Detecting neutronium alloy fibers.
Those used to be theoretical.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.343
Some of these hulls are organic.

04:20.426 --> 04:24.097
Some are completely comprised
of holographic containment walls.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.933
[Owosekun] Is that a new Constitution?

04:27.016 --> 04:30.853
I bet it could sleep a crew of 1000--
No, 2000!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.648
Detached nacelles?
Where do they even put the warp core?

04:36.067 --> 04:38.486
Must be a scout.
I wonder what its range is like.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.958
That's a flying rainforest.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.255
[inaudible dialogue]

05:04.512 --> 05:05.388
What is that?

05:05.471 --> 05:06.806
I think it was that one.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.942
The <i>U.S.S. Voyager.</i>

05:18.026 --> 05:19.193
[Tilly] "J", that's...

05:20.153 --> 05:22.488
ten generations of evolution?

05:23.364 --> 05:24.407
[Owosekun] Eleven.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.242
[woman] Love to hear those stories.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.294
Mr. Bryce, hail Federation headquarters,

05:36.377 --> 05:39.756
and tell them the <i>U.S.S. Discovery</i>
is reporting for duty.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.341
Aye, sir. Hailing now.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.431
-Sir, they're scanning us.
-Oh, as expected.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.268
They require a moment to process
the arrival of a 1000-year-old ship.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.645
Captain, I no longer have control.

05:55.021 --> 05:55.855
On comms, sir.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.316
They'll be docking us remotely,

05:58.399 --> 06:01.736
and request that the captain,
first officer and Tal...

06:03.029 --> 06:04.864
prepare to be beamed over from here.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.242
Their scans must be advanced enough
to pick up her symbiont.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.371
They're ready, sir.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.458
Lieutenant Nilsson, the conn is yours.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.264
You picked a hell of a day
for a homecoming.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.559
Charles Vance,
Commander in Chief, Starfleet.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.020
This is my Chief Security Officer,
Lieutenant Willa.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.022
Captain Saru, <i>U.S.S. Discovery.</i>

08:43.105 --> 08:45.233
Commander Michael Burnham, First Officer.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.400
At ease.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.740
I can't say we've come across
many Kelpiens out here lately.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.704
Has there been any kind
of disturbance on Kaminar?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.289
Status quo, last we checked.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.417
They're just far enough away that
contact's been limited since the Burn.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.045
It's pretty much the case
with most Federation planets these days.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.758
Kaminar joined the Federation.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.932
Sir, the <i>Cuyahoga</i> is reporting
Orion and Andorian vessels

09:18.015 --> 09:19.350
in the Sigma Draconis system.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.102
It's the Emerald Chain.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.690
Osyraa has been becoming
more brazen by the day.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.276
-I want updates in real time.
-[woman 1] Yes, admiral.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.202
You're Senna Tal, per the scan.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.872
Uh, Adira Tal now, sir.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.752
Senna never meant to keep you waiting.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.882
He just couldn't bear to leave Earth
without seeing snow one last time.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.218
Well, he was, uh...

09:55.720 --> 09:56.971
always sentimental.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.348
But let's keep this clear.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.268
He and I were familiar, you and I are not.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.104
Uh, yes, sir.

10:06.814 --> 10:11.360
Lieutenant Willa, take Adira Tal
to medical for a full diagnostic.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.491
Sir, the situation with the Kili refugees
has gotten worse.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.951
Sickbay is overflowing.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.704
We're having to perform triage
in the corridors.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.414
Patient three just started seizing,
doctor.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.334
Dr. Eli says they have
four hours left, at best.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.127
[Vance] Is there a diagnosis yet?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.505
[woman 2] Cascade failure of the nervous
system brought on by misfolding proteins.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.174
Something called prions.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.468
They're not contagious,
but there's no cure yet, either.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.471
There won't be until you find out
where they became infected.

10:39.096 --> 10:42.600
-We could help you analyze their travel.
-We're already in their logs,

10:42.683 --> 10:46.145
compiling a roster of every planet
they visited before they came here.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.523
See what you can do to help.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.319
My apologies if I overstepped.

10:53.402 --> 10:57.365
Simply put, we are anxious to help
our Federation family.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.202
Of course, and I appreciate the offer,
but a debrief must come first.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.871
Your journey here must be quite the story.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.290
A story we are eager to tell, admiral.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.501
Not as eager as I am to hear it.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.255
[Burnham] We're still analyzing the cause
of the spatial and temporal...

11:15.132 --> 11:17.468
variances in our exiting the wormhole.

11:18.302 --> 11:21.222
Early indications suggest that <i>Discovery</i>

11:21.305 --> 11:23.974
may have hit a pocket
of abnormal gravity waves.

11:24.058 --> 11:27.812
And this Red Angel suit of yours,
it's no longer accessible?

11:28.229 --> 11:31.607
I sent it back into the wormhole
to initiate the final signal.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.026
It was then programmed to self-destruct.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.570
There was but one time crystal, admiral.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.658
It was always gonna be a one-way trip
for the sphere data and for all of us.

11:40.741 --> 11:43.494
And what exactly is this data
we're now accountable for?

11:43.577 --> 11:47.081
The sphere is a benevolent life-form
that merged with <i>Discovery.</i>

11:47.164 --> 11:51.127
Its data is a record of everything seen
and experienced by this entity

11:51.210 --> 11:53.629
in the 100,000 years
leading up to our departure.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.089
One hundred thousand years?

11:56.298 --> 11:59.718
Well, <i>Discovery's</i> just full
of surprises, isn't she?

11:59.802 --> 12:04.348
You may be the last Kelpien who still
retains biochemical traces of Vahar'ai.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.435
And your limbic system's been getting
quite a workout, commander.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.895
Are you prone to emotional exaggeration?

12:10.104 --> 12:12.773
Our AI's have evolved quite a bit
since your day.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.651
My primary diagnostic scanners
can read anomalies

12:15.734 --> 12:18.320
as small as aberrant protein coding
in your neurons.

12:18.904 --> 12:19.989
So you can't lie to me.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.240
That'll be all, Eli.

12:24.410 --> 12:28.622
Admiral, if we may,
we have a few questions of our own.

12:28.706 --> 12:29.582
I bet.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.584
Given what you shared of Kaminar,

12:31.667 --> 12:35.296
I am curious as to what remains
of the rest of the Federation.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.799
Thirty-eight member worlds,
that we're aware of.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.052
Down from 350 at its peak.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.931
There may be others,
but since the subspace relays went down,

12:47.016 --> 12:49.602
we're having difficulty
finding each other.

12:50.269 --> 12:54.773
Where we sit now represents not just
the headquarters of Starfleet Command,

12:54.857 --> 12:58.903
but also the entire civilian government
of the United Federation of Planets,

12:58.986 --> 13:00.821
and it's been that way since the Burn.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.575
Sir, if I may ask,
regarding the Burn, we--

13:04.658 --> 13:08.621
I'm not at liberty to discuss intelligence
with you yet, commander.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.248
You're not lying to me,

13:11.957 --> 13:15.169
but there is nothing
in our database to verify

13:15.878 --> 13:18.047
a Red Angel or a Control.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.384
Our intelligence says that <i>Discovery</i>
was destroyed in 2258,

13:22.468 --> 13:26.388
with no mention of
a displacement-activated spore drive.

13:28.349 --> 13:32.353
So, two truths now exist in one space.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.231
That never goes well.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.484
Starfleet's operating procedures
would have included the erasure

13:38.567 --> 13:41.529
of any files that related to our vessel,

13:41.612 --> 13:45.074
to eliminate the possibility
of a recurring threat.

13:45.157 --> 13:49.411
We came here to ensure
that Control did not evolve.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.288
I can't possibly corroborate that.

13:52.706 --> 13:53.874
A quick history lesson,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.211
the Federation has spent most
of the 30th century

13:57.294 --> 14:00.214
fighting a war to uphold
the Temporal Accords,

14:00.673 --> 14:03.092
an interstellar treaty
outlawing time travel

14:03.175 --> 14:06.929
to prevent anyone from the past
from changing the future, and vice versa.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.016
Your presence here,
by definition... is a crime.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.978
Everything we have ever done
has been in accordance

14:14.061 --> 14:17.189
with the ideals of the Federation, sir.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.857
If we hadn't made the jump...

14:19.567 --> 14:23.112
all organic life in the universe
would have ended,

14:23.195 --> 14:27.324
and we wouldn't be having
this conversation... admiral.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.369
[Vance] If that's true, then we owe you
a debt beyond words.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.955
But from where I sit, and I sit here,

14:33.831 --> 14:37.167
trusting you is a risk I cannot take
without evidence.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.963
The safety and security
of whatever's left of the Federation

14:41.046 --> 14:43.591
must take priority over everything else.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.009
And so...

14:46.093 --> 14:47.636
until we sort through this,

14:47.720 --> 14:52.099
I'll be requisitioning <i>Discovery</i>
for analysis and retrofit.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.268
-Admiral!
-Not open to debate, captain.

14:54.852 --> 14:58.355
We'll also be looking through your logs
and debriefing your crew.

14:58.814 --> 15:03.152
And assuming their stories match yours,
determine where they can be reassigned.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.445
Reassigned?

15:05.112 --> 15:06.947
Sir, may I ask why?

15:07.406 --> 15:08.240
No.

15:09.241 --> 15:13.579
Now, you claim you were acting
in accordance with Federation ideals.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.956
I'd ask that you continue to do so,

15:16.540 --> 15:19.835
by putting the needs of Starfleet
ahead of the needs of your crew.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.966
[Burnham] The Federation that I remember
would understand

15:26.050 --> 15:28.427
that there is no other crew
with our experience,

15:28.761 --> 15:30.971
and no other crew that can operate
the spore drive.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.473
Correct on both counts.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.642
Why aren't you fighting for us
to stay together, then?

15:34.975 --> 15:38.020
We are no longer out there, Michael.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.565
We serve Starfleet by executing
the admiral's orders.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.818
Vance should make use of who we are now,
not diminish us for it.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.487
Well, that's entirely his call.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.530
Then let's help him make the right one.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.824
-I understand his motives.
-Well, so do I.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.410
But I also know that if this crew
gets pulled apart now,

15:53.744 --> 15:55.788
some of us might never recover.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.874
If we get our hands on the roster
of where the Kili have been,

15:58.958 --> 16:02.044
then we can help isolate
the origin of the infectious protein.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.505
We can jump there, we can find a cure,

16:04.588 --> 16:06.757
we can help make
a difference for the Kili,

16:06.840 --> 16:09.009
and show the admiral
why we need to stay together.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.056
"Get our hands on"?

16:15.432 --> 16:18.519
I believe we are
in a unique position to help,

16:19.019 --> 16:23.524
and we will do so, by requesting
the roster via proper channels.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.985
Our first Federation act
will not be to pilfer its property

16:26.068 --> 16:28.070
and violate a direct order.

16:28.570 --> 16:32.574
That is a lesson I thought you would have
learned by now, commander.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.620
Of course.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.122
[Tilly] <i>They're breaking us up?</i>

16:39.289 --> 16:42.710
There is no precedent for us.

16:43.335 --> 16:47.840
So, please,
I ask you to trust the process.

16:47.923 --> 16:51.719
What is truly important
is that we are all back home now.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.514
We'll be calling you in by department.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.350
Engineering, Spore Drive Specialists,

16:58.434 --> 17:00.936
Operations, Tactical...

17:01.562 --> 17:02.896
So, you were dead?

17:04.064 --> 17:06.066
Yes. As I said.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.609
Clinically dead?

17:07.901 --> 17:09.653
Well, I was emotionally dead, too.

17:10.320 --> 17:13.240
And I was murdered.
That can really do a number on you.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.325
But my murderer and I are good now.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.953
So, you were on an asteroid, and?

17:18.037 --> 17:21.081
Commander Burnham fell out of the sky,
with Captain Pike.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.333
It was raining Starfleet officers.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.754
Did you bring any snacks? I'm starving.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.214
So, you'd consider yourself
essential personnel?

17:29.506 --> 17:30.758
Have you been talking to Detmer?

17:30.841 --> 17:33.135
Because I can't seem to get away
from this question.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.763
What do you know about the Emerald Chain?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.307
What is that,
some sort of Risan party drug?

17:38.390 --> 17:40.476
It's the Andorian-Orion syndicate.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.561
I've never heard of them.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.646
I'm gonna need something to drink.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.899
All this is after I got my hair blown out

17:46.982 --> 17:49.485
and became a Terran
captain slash dominatrix,

17:49.568 --> 17:52.237
and before we jumped
through a wormhole into the future.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.989
So, I mean... [chuckles]

17:54.490 --> 17:56.450
I love Starfleet, I really do,

17:56.533 --> 17:58.327
but ask me if any of this
was in the handbook.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.787
Was any of this in the handbook?

18:00.621 --> 18:01.455
No.

18:01.538 --> 18:05.250
Nhan, security officer, <i>U.S.S. Discovery.</i>

18:05.542 --> 18:08.754
SFB 534-0679.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.632
Failure to comply is insubordination.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.426
I'm sorry.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.262
Now... how long was the duration--?

18:17.346 --> 18:21.517
Nhan D, security officer,
<i>U.S.S. Discovery.</i>

18:22.976 --> 18:24.561
Throw me in the brig, hologram.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.313
Lieutenant Willa.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.984
We submitted a request to see the roster
of planets the Kili refugees visited.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.402
We've not yet heard back.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.822
If we know where they went,
we can find out what caused this.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.741
We're a science vessel,
and the situations we've encountered--

18:37.825 --> 18:38.742
Sorry, commander.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.037
We're still in the process
of determining your intentions here.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.039
We are not temporal agents, lieutenant.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.999
We need more than your word, captain.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.460
Lieutenant Willa.

18:50.045 --> 18:53.507
I'm sure we would respond the same way
if the situation were reversed.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.970
But one fact is unassailable,
we have a spore drive, and it works.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.931
We can travel anywhere
in the blink of an eye,

19:01.682 --> 19:02.724
and we wanna help.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.645
All we are asking is to be permitted
to look at the roster.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.772
Best case, you save lives.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.234
Worst case, you hate us a little more
for wasting your time.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.738
I'll need to speak with Admiral Vance.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.992
[man] Our scans picked you out right away.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.578
A rigorous debrief is protocol
for Terrans.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.622
[woman] We also know you're a murderer
in at least two universes.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.918
Don't look at him, look at us.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.380
[man] So, this will be your second
universe, your third timeline?

19:34.756 --> 19:36.717
Depends on how you look at it.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.051
I like to look at it like this:

19:40.596 --> 19:41.680
Why are you blinking?

19:42.139 --> 19:43.140
Why aren't you?

19:43.223 --> 19:45.184
-What was your connection to Control?
-We dated.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.728
All Terrans are duplicitous
by their biology.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.605
Or "bi-plicitous" by our "duology."

19:49.688 --> 19:51.815
Neither "-ology"
has anything to do with it.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.109
[man] You may not be aware,
but in the past hundred years,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.904
we've discovered a chimeric strain
on the subatomic level

19:56.987 --> 19:58.614
in the Terran stem cell.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.656
Silly holo.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.577
You cannot rattle me by introducing
a completely fabricated

20:03.660 --> 20:08.207
biological component to my nastiness
and inherently bad behavior.

20:08.665 --> 20:12.920
I'm extremely wicked, even for a Terran.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.093
-Who are you? What if you're not a holo?
-Make her stop.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.847
What if you're a human
programmed to think he's a holo?

20:29.978 --> 20:31.688
You broke my holos.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.275
Blinking at their harmonic rate
disrupts the holo protocols,

20:35.359 --> 20:37.402
creating a reference loop
that shuts them down.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.656
Upgrade your programs,
and stop wasting my time.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.618
Why are you wearing glasses?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.371
Uh, they make me look smarter.

20:48.121 --> 20:48.956
I like them.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.250
I might decide to like you.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.169
Debrief as you will.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.672
[woman on pa] <i>Trauma Unit</i>
<i>to Medbay 6, overflow.</i>

20:56.755 --> 20:57.881
[man] Vitals are dropping.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.425
-Pressure is spiking over here.
-[monitor beeping]

21:00.509 --> 21:02.511
[woman] Pressure is spiking,
heart rate is climbing.

21:02.594 --> 21:03.971
[man] Scan again.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.806
[woman] Two more cc's right away.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.018
[Vance]
You believe they became ill on Urna?

21:10.811 --> 21:13.397
That planet's been deserted for centuries.

21:13.939 --> 21:19.069
Yes, but Urna is,
well, once was an industrial seat,

21:19.152 --> 21:21.697
a hub for the enrichment
of unstable metals.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.782
The Federation was just beginning
to sound the alarm

21:23.865 --> 21:26.034
about toxicity a thousand years ago.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.245
The atmosphere was thinning,

21:28.328 --> 21:32.291
and they feared high concentration
of UVB radiation would mutate the biology

21:32.374 --> 21:35.252
of everything on the surface,
and that is what happened.

21:35.335 --> 21:39.298
If the Kili stopped there,
they scavenged there

21:39.631 --> 21:43.176
for indigenous plants, fruit,
any kind of nutrition.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.053
Whatever they ate was mutated.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.055
It was infected with misfolded proteins

21:47.139 --> 21:49.516
that have been spreading
in their bodies ever since.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.851
How do we fix the problem?

21:51.351 --> 21:52.769
We need a healthy protein sample

21:52.853 --> 21:55.230
of the plant they ingested
to make an antidote.

21:55.939 --> 21:59.609
But, as all of Urna was affected,
such a sample no longer exists.

22:01.194 --> 22:04.656
In the 23rd century,
there was a Federation seed vault ship,

22:04.740 --> 22:06.408
the <i>U.S.S. Tikhov.</i>

22:07.367 --> 22:09.369
It held samples of every plant
in the galaxy.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.704
If it still exists,

22:10.787 --> 22:13.749
it will have seeds from before
the planet's environmental collapse,

22:13.832 --> 22:15.584
and we can synthesize
an antidote from that.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.962
The <i>Tikhov</i> is still around,
but it's five months away.

22:19.046 --> 22:22.090
Our spore drive can get us there
and back in plenty of time.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.676
Your ship can get us there...

22:25.260 --> 22:26.970
with that one man, Stamets.

22:28.055 --> 22:30.932
Willa, download <i>Discovery's</i> specs,
everything on the spore drive,

22:31.016 --> 22:33.060
and scramble
a Federation team to pilot her.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.811
-I want it flying in an hour.
-Yes, sir.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.899
Admiral, you have a crew
ready and able to fly now.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.985
You're going to waste precious time
teaching a new crew the ins and outs

22:42.069 --> 22:44.946
of a 1000-year-old ship
flying through a mushroom network?

22:45.781 --> 22:47.240
Watch your tone, commander.

22:48.658 --> 22:49.659
You're not home yet.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.120
[Saru] Admiral...

22:53.038 --> 22:57.667
I would ask that you allow <i>Discovery</i>
to serve as she is able.

22:58.168 --> 23:03.048
It and Commander Burnham are ideally
suited for this kind of away mission.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.926
Understanding it is a matter of trust.

23:06.259 --> 23:09.179
I will remain here with you, to assist.

23:12.182 --> 23:16.186
Lieutenant Willa and two security officers
will go with Commander Burnham.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.063
Get back fast.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.899
Otherwise, it comes down on him.

23:31.910 --> 23:35.497
-Undocking is complete, commander.
-Bring us to safe distance, please.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.584
Hope this fossil of a ship
can do what you say it can.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.131
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant Willa.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.133
We're ready to go, commander.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.385
[Burnham] We have three hours
to retrieve the seed sample

23:48.468 --> 23:50.137
and create an antidote for the Kili.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.888
Let's show them who we are.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.186
You might wanna hold onto something.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.233
Black alert.

24:03.316 --> 24:06.278
[siren wailing]

24:16.496 --> 24:17.414
Whoa.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.208
We're at programmed coordinates,
but there's no sign of the <i>Tikhov.</i>

24:20.876 --> 24:22.627
Scans show an ion storm in range.

24:22.711 --> 24:23.545
Bring it up.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.967
[Owosekun] If these were the last known
coordinates of the <i>Tikhov,</i>

24:29.050 --> 24:30.051
it must be in there.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.596
Yellow alert.
Lieutenant Rhys, prepare tractor beams.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.891
We'll have to pull it out of the storm
before we can beam onboard.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.185
-Aye, commander.
-Lieutenant Detmer, get us over there.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.269
Aye, commander.

24:39.352 --> 24:42.105
It's going to be a bumpy ride. Shields up.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.327
Shields holding at 90 percent.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.371
Commander, I've located the <i>Tikhov.</i>
Magnifying now.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.666
It's running on auxiliary power.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.461
Warp drive is offline.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.047
There's unusual radiation
that must be interfering with our scans.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.507
I can't get an accurate read
on life signs.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.224
How are we on tractor beams?

25:17.307 --> 25:18.850
-Not steady enough.
-I'm working on it!

25:22.812 --> 25:25.065
Approaching 5H. Increasing--

25:28.777 --> 25:30.862
Shields are holding.
You've got time. You've got this.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.745
Lieutenant?

25:39.246 --> 25:41.706
Engaging reverse thrusters.
I just need to get us clear--

25:47.462 --> 25:48.630
-Go!
-Locking on.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.010
Got her.

25:55.428 --> 25:56.554
Pulling her out now.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.104
And we're clear.

26:04.646 --> 26:07.732
Bryce, have Dr. Culber
report to the bridge.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.442
Nice work, Keyla.

26:10.193 --> 26:11.278
Hey.

26:11.361 --> 26:14.114
-You did great.
-Closer call than it should have been.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.575
Owo, what's the toxicity
of the radiation on that ship?

26:17.659 --> 26:20.495
Scanner says it's not ionizing,
so it shouldn't be a threat to health.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.832
But its composition is just odd.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.542
-Tilly?
-Already analyzing it.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.044
Who needs what?

26:28.128 --> 26:30.005
There may be a medical emergency
on the <i>Tikhov.</i>

26:30.088 --> 26:33.216
For the last 500 years, each planet
of the Federation has taken turns

26:33.300 --> 26:35.510
keeping watch over the seed vault.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.889
Looks like a Barzan family
was most recent.

26:42.475 --> 26:45.270
-We joined the Federation?
-In the 25th century.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.064
Never imagined.

26:48.148 --> 26:50.442
I haven't seen a Barzan
since I joined Starfleet.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.193
You will today.
I want you with us on this.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.780
We don't have time to play catch up,
so get your hellos out of the way fast.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.951
Anyway. The atmosphere onboard
is attuned to Barzan biology.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.202
We'll need breathing devices.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.830
So, I can lose mine.
First time for everything.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.751
The seed vault itself can only be accessed
by beaming into and out of it,

27:07.834 --> 27:09.794
so the transporter chief
will need to stay ready.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.087
Understood.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.922
Tilly, let me know
what you find on radiation.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.299
Rhys, you have the conn.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.052
Let's go.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.599
[Culber] What the hell?

27:22.682 --> 27:25.060
[Burnham] Someone must have compromised
the seed vault.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.270
None of these plants should be here.

27:27.771 --> 27:31.608
The Barzan atmosphere lends itself
to more accelerated plant growth.

27:32.650 --> 27:33.526
Your eyes...

27:34.944 --> 27:36.404
Real air, real me.

27:38.031 --> 27:41.201
Well, radiation's nominal.
Whatever the source, it's dissipated.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.369
Levels are safe.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.871
-How many in the family?
-[Burnham] Four.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.956
Parents are scientists.
They have two kids.

27:47.874 --> 27:48.917
Well, that's weird.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.669
A life sign just blinked on,
and then off again.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.881
Residual radiation must still be
interfering with our instruments.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.175
We might not be able to rely on them.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.638
Okay. Seed vault should be this way.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.729
[creature snarls]

28:19.364 --> 28:21.533
You're curious about my badge.

28:22.450 --> 28:25.328
I'm bored, and thought
I could break it down for parts.

28:28.039 --> 28:28.998
Play with it.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.885
It's clear, Emperor,
what you're capable of.

28:41.761 --> 28:44.931
What's not clear to me
is why you chose to come here.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.516
I have a curious nature.

28:46.599 --> 28:49.769
Really? April 5th is my birthday.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.563
A Terran holy day.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.815
April 5th, 2063,

28:54.190 --> 28:58.278
first ever contact between Terrans
and a Vulcan survey ship.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.156
But then your people
slaughtered everybody onboard.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.908
Vulcans need to learn
to stay in their lane sometimes.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.910
It's not like it's a high holy day.

29:05.994 --> 29:10.874
I've been fascinated by Terran history
and methodology since I was a boy.

29:11.082 --> 29:14.502
There are very few species
that do things simply to do them.

29:14.586 --> 29:19.299
We're mostly untroubled
by pesky motivations, except for revenge.

29:19.382 --> 29:20.467
We do like that one.

29:20.550 --> 29:25.430
It seems you created an empire based
on the maxim "because we feel like it."

29:26.055 --> 29:29.100
So, why would you ever join
a Starfleet crew?

29:29.184 --> 29:31.811
If you simply wanted to butcher them,
you would have.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.773
Much as I enjoy being fetishized,
and I do...

29:36.983 --> 29:40.695
I'll answer your questions
if you answer mine first.

29:41.571 --> 29:43.615
No, you won't really do that.

29:44.157 --> 29:44.991
Correct.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.910
And even if you did, you'd lie,

29:46.993 --> 29:51.790
so the only way I'll glean any information
is via the questions you ask me.

29:52.081 --> 29:52.916
So, please.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.544
Who's really in charge now?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.213
The Burn appeared to have been

29:58.296 --> 30:00.715
quite the humbling experience
for the Federation.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.133
Who was responsible?

30:02.217 --> 30:04.302
-That's two questions.
-Pick one.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.680
There are conflicting theories,

30:07.764 --> 30:12.060
but no hard proof
pointing at any one particular bad guy.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.312
Sounds like the Federation lost a step...

30:14.729 --> 30:15.563
or five.

30:15.772 --> 30:16.898
And yet it endures,

30:16.981 --> 30:20.193
unlike the Terran Empire,
which fell centuries ago.

30:22.278 --> 30:25.698
Were you aware that the distance
between our two universes

30:25.782 --> 30:28.952
started expanding
sometime after your departure?

30:29.953 --> 30:34.165
There hasn't been
a single crossing in over 500 years.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.293
You didn't know that, did you?

30:38.419 --> 30:39.754
You're all alone now.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.468
I think you and the Federation are afraid

30:45.552 --> 30:48.304
because whoever did this
must be merciless,

30:48.388 --> 30:51.975
a threat to whatever
or whomever you hold dear.

30:53.518 --> 30:58.189
The weakness of people
is generally other people, isn't it?

31:00.149 --> 31:01.317
You're not wrong.

31:01.734 --> 31:05.572
But that could also explain
why you'd fall in line with <i>Discovery</i>.

31:06.364 --> 31:11.661
But there's a person on the crew
you care about, isn't there?

31:18.376 --> 31:19.961
[girl humming nearby]

31:20.753 --> 31:21.713
The family.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.007
Behind us.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.175
Adira played that same melody.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.303
How is that possible?

32:11.554 --> 32:12.388
What?

32:18.686 --> 32:21.814
Nothing. See if you can find
any sign of the family.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.608
I'm going in the vault.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.486
[comms beeps]

32:26.569 --> 32:28.488
Burnham to <i>Discovery</i>. Do you copy?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.115
I'm right outside the seed vault.
One to beam in.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.575
[Tilly] <i>Aye, commander.</i>

32:52.679 --> 32:54.514
[in Barzan] Where's Venus?

32:55.723 --> 32:57.016
[Attis] Far away.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.353
[girl]
I don't want the plant to be lonely.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.360
You okay?

33:08.152 --> 33:09.487
I wish I'd gone home...

33:10.697 --> 33:11.906
before we came to the future.

33:13.574 --> 33:17.662
My species is known for two things:
diligence and poverty.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.665
What little we get,
we invest in our children.

33:21.499 --> 33:24.419
Your family must have been so proud
when you joined Starfleet.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.629
They were devastated.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.800
I can only imagine
when they heard about my death.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.927
I think Venus is still hungry.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.141
When was the last time
you heard your own language?

33:39.475 --> 33:40.476
Now.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.604
Now is the last time.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.108
I'll check in with Burnham.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.318
If you wanna search the logs,
I'll be fine.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.113
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Nhan, come here.

34:53.841 --> 34:58.221
The rest of the ship is on auxiliary,
but whatever's behind here seems to be...

34:58.304 --> 34:59.806
Running on full power.

35:04.435 --> 35:05.353
Do it.

35:25.373 --> 35:29.252
Cryostasis is normally used
to preserve the living for revival, but...

35:30.044 --> 35:31.671
they're already gone.

35:31.754 --> 35:32.630
You're sure?

35:39.971 --> 35:40.972
Attis.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.808
Attis is alive.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.352
He's still trying to save them.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.981
That's what all these plants are about.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.067
He broke open the seed vault
trying to grow...

35:55.111 --> 35:56.070
a cure.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.072
I think you mean a miracle.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.993

36:15.965 --> 36:17.633
No, the seeds are not yours!

36:20.094 --> 36:20.928
They're ours.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.847
They need them.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.309
-They're gonna come back.
-Please, we're here to help.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.396
What?

36:37.862 --> 36:39.363
[Burnham] He was fighting me.

36:40.031 --> 36:44.619
He didn't want me to get to those seeds,
and there was something about his face.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.830
It folded in on itself
before he disappeared.

36:48.247 --> 36:52.126
It was as if his entire body
was out of phase somehow.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.754
I saw something like that on the log.

36:54.962 --> 36:57.131
It was like he was
out of sync with himself.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.300
Well, any ideas as to
what might have caused this?

36:59.383 --> 37:01.219
Well, I'd have to examine him first,

37:01.302 --> 37:05.181
but I'm not confident he'd be able to
fill in any more than we already know.

37:05.556 --> 37:06.766
But from what you're saying,

37:06.849 --> 37:10.436
his grief seems to have
disconnected him from reality.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.314
He hasn't gone crazy,
if that's what you suggest.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.859
Well, his family's clearly deceased,
and he won't accept that.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.862
Barzans don't have
the same idea of death as humans.

37:20.279 --> 37:24.492
If there's logic to his behavior,
then maybe we can reason with him.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.620
And we need his voice code
to access the vault,

37:28.037 --> 37:29.622
or those refugees are as good as dead.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.457
The Admiral has given us this chance.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.625
We can't fail.

37:32.708 --> 37:36.128
Any ideas on how to stop the phasing
long enough to talk to him?

37:37.171 --> 37:38.256
The phasing itself.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.927
It might explain why he survived
and his family didn't.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.598
If we figure out what happened,
maybe we can fix him.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.184
The team should be nearly done
analyzing the radiation.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.437
Are these values from a magnetic
or mass spectrometer?

37:53.521 --> 37:54.355
Duh.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.898
Which means magnetic.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.275
I know what "duh" means.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.194
Can we just irradiate
your entire personality?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.780
Calibrating for cosmic
background radiation.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.573
-I was just gonna--
-Ask me to do that?

38:04.657 --> 38:05.658
Duh.

38:05.741 --> 38:07.535
Your relationship isn't very professional.

38:07.743 --> 38:10.997
-[both] It's how we work.
-I've been trying to raise the bar.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.291
-[Burnham] <i>Tilly?</i>
-Yes, hi, Michael, I'm here.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.418
<i>You also have Commander Stamets</i>
<i>and Commander Reno.</i>

38:15.501 --> 38:16.919
We're analyzing the radiation.

38:17.003 --> 38:20.172
Listen, Doctor Attis is the only survivor.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.466
He described the ship
being hit by a bright light,

38:22.842 --> 38:26.053
and the bodies of his family are showing
high concentrations of beta particles.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.596
That could be any number of things.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.765
He's also phasing uncontrollably.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.183
Okay, now we're onto something.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.937
Beaming is the only way
in or out of the seed vault, right?

38:35.271 --> 38:36.772
I'm gonna look for the nearest star.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.150
-You're thinking CME.
-Yep.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.276
What am I missing?

38:40.651 --> 38:44.572
The ship may have been hit by a CME,
a coronal mass ejection.

38:45.406 --> 38:46.407
Kind of like a star burp.

38:46.490 --> 38:50.453
"Burp" in this instance would be
a massive, radioactive proton storm.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.163
It should kill anyone instantly,

38:52.246 --> 38:54.373
but if Doctor Attis
was in the process of beaming

38:54.457 --> 38:56.208
into the vault when the CME hit,

38:56.625 --> 38:59.378
<i>the protons would have interfered</i>
<i>with the ship's magnetic shielding</i>

38:59.462 --> 39:02.423
and destabilized his body's polarization
on a quantum level.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.050
-Right.
-Bingo.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.677
Oh, yep. CME, almost six weeks ago.

39:07.094 --> 39:10.806
Now his body's in limbo.
May I never say the same about myself.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.892
Is there a way to bring him back in phase?

39:12.975 --> 39:15.686
I think so, but I'm pretty sure
he's not gonna like it.

from finding a cure.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.195
We just need one set of seeds.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.447
There are other families in trouble.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.449
We want to help them, too.

40:17.832 --> 40:18.958
You need to talk to him.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.919
I couldn't even come close
to understanding him the way Nhan does.

40:22.002 --> 40:23.129
That's my point.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.005
It's too personal for her.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.843
Because they share the same ethos,
she's not being honest with him.

40:29.343 --> 40:32.888
He needs to know that his family is gone,
however brutal that may be.

40:33.597 --> 40:36.183
And that if he doesn't get help soon,
he's going to die.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.268

41:04.462 --> 41:06.130
And I think you know that.

41:06.755 --> 41:10.843
Just like I think you know there isn't
anything onboard that can change that.

41:12.303 --> 41:17.600
But there is something onboard
that can help other families like yours.

42:36.053 --> 42:37.388
They're my daughters.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.811
Doctor Attis...

42:44.937 --> 42:45.980
thank you.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.794
[rumbling]

43:52.463 --> 43:55.341
Tilly, prepare to beam Doctor Attis
directly to sickbay.

43:57.134 --> 43:59.094
No. I won't go.

43:59.470 --> 44:03.140
Doctor Attis, you are severely irradiated
from the original CME.

44:03.307 --> 44:06.060
All of your internal organs
will have been damaged.

44:06.226 --> 44:08.479
Without treatment,
you will die within days.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.314
I won't leave my family.

44:15.986 --> 44:19.990
That man in there is incapable of making
rational decisions about his own health.

44:20.366 --> 44:23.827
Just because you don't understand a choice
doesn't make it irrational.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.829
Well, think of the ship itself, then.

44:25.954 --> 44:28.290
It contains a living history
of the Federation.

44:28.582 --> 44:30.209
We need that now more than ever.

44:30.751 --> 44:32.628
We can't take him
against his will, either.

44:33.295 --> 44:35.214
He expressed his wishes, clearly.

44:35.631 --> 44:38.008
Since when does Starfleet
not consider cultural mitigations?

44:38.550 --> 44:41.053
Hugh, why don't you take these seeds
back to <i>Discovery</i>,

44:41.136 --> 44:42.638
start working on an antidote.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.059
Thank you.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.145
[comms beeps]

44:50.229 --> 44:51.230
One to science lab.

44:58.779 --> 45:01.031
I respect Doctor Attis' personal choice,

45:01.824 --> 45:04.868
but Starfleet has always had
its own mores,

45:05.369 --> 45:08.414
one of them being
never to leave a person behind.

45:10.165 --> 45:11.875
So it's him versus Starfleet, then.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.003
Sometimes there is no good choice.

45:17.756 --> 45:19.258
Only what you can live with.

45:20.551 --> 45:25.097
I don't think I can live with letting part
of the Federation's history die with him.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.604
Then I'll stay.

45:41.488 --> 45:45.367
Nhan, if you stay,
you'd be giving up your career.

45:48.829 --> 45:51.331
Considering what Airiam and I
went through,

45:52.332 --> 45:53.667
let's just say...

45:54.460 --> 45:55.377
I'm good here.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.466
I'll make sure Attis' family gets home
for a proper burial,

46:01.091 --> 46:04.136
and that the first Barzan watch
is completed successfully.

46:07.389 --> 46:09.224
And I'd like to see my home again.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.060
I never thought I would.

46:15.105 --> 46:16.565
You gonna argue with me?

46:22.488 --> 46:24.198
A year ago, I would have.

46:27.075 --> 46:32.498
You know, I have never forgotten
what you said at Airiam's funeral.

46:33.248 --> 46:35.667
That one of the reasons
we join Starfleet...

46:36.335 --> 46:38.337
is to reach for the best in ourselves...

46:39.713 --> 46:40.881
and each other.

46:43.383 --> 46:45.636
And I have never seen anyone

46:45.719 --> 46:49.431
reach for the best in others
quite like you, Michael.

46:52.059 --> 46:53.227
Don't ever stop.

47:04.238 --> 47:06.573
I really hope our paths cross again.

47:07.282 --> 47:08.283
Me, too.

47:14.331 --> 47:15.374
[comms beeps]

47:16.583 --> 47:17.751
One to beam back.

47:48.365 --> 47:51.076
It is my understanding,
per Lieutenant Willa's report,

47:51.159 --> 47:54.788
that Lieutenant Detmer and Owosekun
successfully took <i>Discovery</i>

47:54.871 --> 47:57.124
into an ion storm to get to the <i>Tikhov.</i>

47:57.624 --> 47:58.542
Yes, sir.

47:59.585 --> 48:02.588
Commander Nhan remained
on duty there for the Federation.

48:03.088 --> 48:05.090
Our entire crew understood the mission,

48:05.507 --> 48:08.302
and were prepared
for any potential implications.

48:08.802 --> 48:10.387
We stand ready for more.

48:10.470 --> 48:13.682
Well, you should know we don't have
five-year missions anymore.

48:13.765 --> 48:16.977
Exploration is a luxury we cannot afford.

48:17.894 --> 48:23.275
Admiral, are you familiar
with Earth's Renaissance painter Giotto?

48:23.734 --> 48:24.901
Where are you going with this?

48:24.985 --> 48:28.780
The period before the Renaissance
was referred to as the Dark Ages,

48:28.864 --> 48:30.324
a frightening time.

48:30.741 --> 48:33.869
Humanity was under siege
from wars and plagues,

48:33.952 --> 48:35.829
and it was, well, losing its way.

48:36.622 --> 48:40.375
Giotto helped spark the Renaissance
when, with his art,

48:41.001 --> 48:43.962
he helped create
the three-point perspective.

48:45.422 --> 48:46.340
He saw depth.

48:47.174 --> 48:51.094
He saw entirety,
and he gave what he saw to the world.

48:51.637 --> 48:52.804
It made a difference.

48:53.180 --> 48:56.558
For the first time in a long time,
humans looked up.

48:57.184 --> 49:00.103
<i>Discovery</i> is a servant of the Federation.

49:00.646 --> 49:04.316
But I believe that our unique perspective
from a revered time may--

49:04.399 --> 49:07.444
May help us to look up.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.072
Yes, sir.

49:13.659 --> 49:15.869
We have been in triage for a long time.

49:19.539 --> 49:20.916
Sir.

49:20.999 --> 49:23.418
We have a spore drive
that can take us anywhere,

49:24.419 --> 49:27.214
a crew that operates
as one breathing organism,

49:27.422 --> 49:30.050
and Sphere data that offers
thousands of years of wisdom.

49:30.967 --> 49:34.346
Keep us together and let us help.

49:36.139 --> 49:37.349
That's all we ask.

49:42.437 --> 49:43.647
But your crew...

49:44.564 --> 49:47.651
they're only now beginning to wrangle
with the trauma they went through.

49:47.859 --> 49:52.197
Your pilot, Detmer, her baselines
are unsteady, to put it mildly.

49:52.489 --> 49:55.200
We've all put our lives in Detmer's hands,
and we'd do it again, sir.

50:01.039 --> 50:01.957
All right.

50:05.043 --> 50:08.630
But you go where I say, when I say it.
We're not in the Renaissance yet.

50:09.047 --> 50:10.215
[both] Yes, sir.

50:10.298 --> 50:11.675
Anything else?

50:11.758 --> 50:12.634
-No, sir.
-The Burn--

50:14.386 --> 50:15.220
Sir.

50:16.638 --> 50:18.932
Are you at liberty
to discuss it with us now?

50:19.850 --> 50:22.811
We have more theories than ships
in the fleet at the moment.

50:24.604 --> 50:28.024
The Federation never found enough data
to support one over the other.

50:28.608 --> 50:31.069
-Which theory do you believe?
-Doesn't matter.

50:31.319 --> 50:35.282
Unless you have a new piece of evidence
that has gone unnoticed for 120 years...

50:36.700 --> 50:38.410
we have far more immediate concerns.

50:39.619 --> 50:40.662
Challenge accepted.

50:43.582 --> 50:44.833
And understood, sir.

50:47.377 --> 50:48.211
Captain.

50:49.129 --> 50:49.963
Commander.

50:51.173 --> 50:52.090
Welcome home.

50:56.553 --> 50:57.512
[chattering]

51:11.193 --> 51:12.360
Oh, Lieutenant Willa.

51:12.611 --> 51:15.697
Did you find anything about that music
that I asked you about?

51:15.781 --> 51:16.656
Nothing to find.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.826
Half the people here know
some version of it, including me.

51:20.327 --> 51:21.828
Don't you find that strange?

51:22.996 --> 51:24.664
The Barzan planet, the <i>Tikhov,</i>

51:24.748 --> 51:27.709
they're unimaginably far away
from here without dilithium.

51:28.293 --> 51:31.546
And there's no way Doctor Attis
could have come anywhere near this sector.

51:32.798 --> 51:34.966
How is it that everyone knows
the same piece of music?

51:36.635 --> 51:38.094
Some things get in the ether.

51:47.979 --> 51:51.566
Philippa. Let me run something by you.
There's this piece of music--

51:53.860 --> 51:54.694
Philippa.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.118
Philippa?

52:06.498 --> 52:07.457
Are you okay?

52:08.834 --> 52:09.960
Michael.

52:10.919 --> 52:12.337
I asked if you were okay.

52:13.380 --> 52:16.716
Why would you ever,
ever ask me a question like that?

52:26.184 --> 52:28.228
[Saru] Does it feel like home to you?

52:29.229 --> 52:30.146
Not yet.

52:32.774 --> 52:34.317
But I truly hope it will.

52:37.737 --> 52:40.615
The Federation is an ideal
that saved my life.

52:41.283 --> 52:44.202
Not once, but many, many times.

52:44.786 --> 52:46.496
It's the people who saved mine.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.877
Over the last year,
I've come to realize that...

52:52.961 --> 52:55.088
the Federation is its people.

52:58.884 --> 53:00.719
I can't separate the two anymore.

53:01.761 --> 53:03.346
One living organism?

53:05.557 --> 53:06.766
Yeah.

53:07.392 --> 53:09.436
I do value your perspective, Michael.

53:13.773 --> 53:19.738
But I would ask that you choose
your words more carefully with the admiral

53:19.821 --> 53:24.284
than you did before your departure,
or it will impact us both.

53:27.162 --> 53:28.079
Yes, sir.

53:35.337 --> 53:37.422
So much we still do not know.

53:39.257 --> 53:41.051
But I am certain of one thing.

53:43.637 --> 53:45.680
We are both looking up.
