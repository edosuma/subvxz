WEBVTT

03:36.967 --> 03:39.428
He who merits...

03:40.429 --> 03:46.185
...through qualification and virtue,
the highest ranks...

03:47.978 --> 03:51.732
...is, however, not counted...

03:52.608 --> 03:55.569
...among the members
of our Central Committee.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.030
And so...

04:00.157 --> 04:04.203
...we only can explain it
by reading this letter...

04:05.079 --> 04:08.082
...from the hand and word...

04:09.291 --> 04:13.087
...of Comrade Ernesto Guevara.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.760
A self-explanatory letter.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.514
It says the following:

04:23.722 --> 04:26.725
<i>Havana, Year of Agriculture.</i>

04:27.643 --> 04:32.773
<i>Fidel, at this moment
I remember many things:</i>

04:33.607 --> 04:36.444
<i>When I met you
at Maria Antonia 's house...</i>

04:37.194 --> 04:40.030
<i>...when you proposed that I come along...</i>

04:40.489 --> 04:43.200
<i>...all the tension
involved in the preparations.</i>

04:44.201 --> 04:48.539
<i>One day they came by asking
who to notify in case of death...</i>

04:49.498 --> 04:53.085
<i>...and the real possibility
of it struck us all.</i>

04:55.463 --> 04:58.215
<i>Later we knew it was true...</i>

04:59.091 --> 05:04.263
<i>...that in a real revolution,
one either wins or dies.</i>

05:06.307 --> 05:08.809
<i>I feel that I have
completed the part of my duty...</i>

05:09.185 --> 05:12.354
<i>...that tied me to the
Cuban Revolution in its territory...</i>

05:13.397 --> 05:15.357
<i>...and I say farewell to you...</i>

05:15.649 --> 05:20.070
<i>...to the comrades,
to your people, who now are mine.</i>

05:20.821 --> 05:23.491
<i>I formally resign my positions...</i>

05:24.074 --> 05:26.327
<i>...in the leadership of the party...</i>

05:26.660 --> 05:32.666
<i>...my post as minister, my rank of
Comandante, and my Cuban citizenship.</i>

05:33.834 --> 05:39.673
<i>Other nations of the world summon
my modest efforts of assistance.</i>

05:40.674 --> 05:45.179
<i>I can do what is denied to you by
your responsibility as Cuba 's leader...</i>

05:46.180 --> 05:48.390
<i>...and the time
has come for us to part.</i>

05:49.683 --> 05:53.312
<i>If my last hour
arrives beneath other skies...</i>

05:54.313 --> 05:58.484
<i>...my last thought
will be for this people...</i>

05:59.109 --> 06:00.861
<i>...and especially for you.</i>

06:25.844 --> 06:27.888
Let me see you without the hat.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.688
You're the living portrait
of your father.

06:39.525 --> 06:40.776
You have the money?

06:42.695 --> 06:43.862
Yes.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.244
We could wait
until things settle down.

06:52.413 --> 06:57.668
If we don't do it now, we'll have
to wait another 50 years.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.296
One more.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.756
One, two...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.510
...three.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.349
Aleidita, remember Morn and Dad
sit at the head of the table.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.645
But since Dad's not here,
we'll give his friend Ramén the seat.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.398
Here it is. Four...

07:20.816 --> 07:22.276
...and five.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.284
What is he doing?

07:30.576 --> 07:32.661
I don't know.
Go see what your brother is doing.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.914
Go see what your brother is doing.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.640
Special representative
from the “O.A.S.”?

08:37.308 --> 08:39.727
Yes,
the Organization of American States.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.315
Just a second, please.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.988
There's a man who is
a special O.A.S. representative.

08:50.572 --> 08:54.493
Organization of American States?
Yes, let him in.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.626
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.754
Mister,
may I help you with your suitcase?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.297
No need.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.868
L'm worried about Monje.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.037
Why?

14:30.203 --> 14:33.206
When I asked him about
the 20 men he promised...

14:34.332 --> 14:38.712
...he said, “Which men?” as if I had
never talked to him.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.215
It's okay.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.395
Apolinar.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.065
Serapio.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.358
- How old are you, Serapio?
- Sixteen.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.988
At sixteen,
a man already knows what he wants.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.243
Hello. I'm Camba.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.745
Ramén.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.044
Do you know who that man is?

15:19.878 --> 15:21.046
He came with you.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.799
The man you just shook hands with...

15:24.091 --> 15:25.759
...is Che Guevara.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.973
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.019
Could I shake his hand again?

16:44.838 --> 16:46.464
- Ramén.
- Ricardo.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.970
- This is Coco, lnti's brother.
- I know, I know.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.848
- The farm is under his name.
- Braulio.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.101
- How are you doing, bro?
- How are you?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.062
'Miguel!

17:01.521 --> 17:05.108
- Urbano, how was the trip?
- Quite tough.

17:10.864 --> 17:11.948
Rolando.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.369
You're lnti?

17:17.537 --> 17:20.957
-It's an honor to meet you.
- The honor is mine. I'm Ramon.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.878
This is doctor Ernesto Maymura.

17:26.338 --> 17:30.258
He's in the Bolivian Communist Party
and studied medicine in Havana.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.553
- Where did you do your residency?
- At Calixto Garcia.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.518
And so we fell asleep.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.897
Do you know where we woke up?

17:44.272 --> 17:47.108
-In the United States.
-ln New York.

17:49.069 --> 17:52.155
We went right in with
our Panamanian passports.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.241
Everything was going smoothly...

17:54.574 --> 17:57.911
...until we almost screwed it up
because we were so hungry!

17:59.037 --> 18:02.415
Braulio says, “Let's go
over there, they have hot dogs.”

18:03.333 --> 18:07.087
So we got there, and
of course, the vendor was Dominican.

18:07.295 --> 18:11.841
The first thing he says is,
“Oh, but you're Cuban.”

18:12.592 --> 18:14.427
Brauliojust looks at him.

18:16.304 --> 18:20.141
He served us the hot dogs
without another word.

18:21.184 --> 18:25.063
I made a mistake
and took the wrong flight.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.109
You didn't make a mistake,
you discovered something.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.027
What did we discover?

18:31.528 --> 18:35.949
Ifyou dress an elephant as a man,
it would still make it into Bolivia.

18:38.868 --> 18:39.953
Good one!

18:40.120 --> 18:43.039
To Bolivia or anywhere else!

18:49.462 --> 18:50.630
Brother!

19:00.432 --> 19:01.558
Let's go.

19:12.902 --> 19:13.653
Hello.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.158
- Eustaquio.
- Welcome, Eustaquio. I'm Ramén.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.536
- Salustio.
- Ramén.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.081
-L'm Pedro.
- Ramén.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.584
Paco.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.502
Aniceto.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.421
Tuma, this is Aniceto.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.174
Carlos.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.926
Tuma.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.181
- Willy.
-l'm Chapaco.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.225
L'll need a few days
to learn all your names.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.531
In the last conversation
I had with Monje...

21:22.031 --> 21:24.617
...l made it clear that if we really
want to change this society...

21:25.034 --> 21:27.036
...we are the ones
most capable of doing it.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.789
That's why the party
has to support the guerrilla.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.129
Monje expressed his doubts about
the armed struggle.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.507
He began to talk
about his love for his family.

21:39.716 --> 21:42.510
And here people also have children
and women that they have left behind.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.806
That is why,
with all due respect, Ramén...

21:48.141 --> 21:50.768
...l don't think the party
will support an armed struggle...

21:51.561 --> 21:53.313
...much less Mario Monje.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.234
So I want to ask for permission
to go back to La Paz...

21:58.401 --> 22:01.404
...and recruit
the best people from the party...

22:02.530 --> 22:04.157
...to join the group.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.286
First we have to meet Mario Monje...

22:08.495 --> 22:09.704
...as we agreed to.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.332
Not doing so would be inappropriate.

22:28.473 --> 22:32.268
Conditions are not right for
the kind of struggle you propose.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.562
Mario.

22:35.396 --> 22:38.608
Anywhere in the world where men
are being exploited by men...

22:38.858 --> 22:40.693
...conditions are right.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.864
When children work in mines...

22:45.865 --> 22:50.495
...and 5O percent of miners
don't reach 30 years of age.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.707
When these same miners
go on strike...

22:55.542 --> 22:57.293
...to improve their wages...

22:57.794 --> 23:03.675
...and they are massacred by the army,
are those conditions right, or not?

23:05.218 --> 23:08.471
If infant mortality rates...

23:09.138 --> 23:11.349
...are the highest in Latin America...

23:11.558 --> 23:14.227
...because of lack of hospitals
and medical care...

23:15.228 --> 23:16.896
...the situation is right for me.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.609
Ifwe learned something in Cuba...

23:23.152 --> 23:27.156
...it's that a popular uprising
that isn't backed by armed struggle...

23:27.782 --> 23:30.410
...has no chance of taking power.

23:32.579 --> 23:36.833
When people learn that
this movement is led by a foreigner...

23:37.333 --> 23:39.168
...they will turn their backs on you.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.922
You will die heroically...

23:44.215 --> 23:48.261
...but you have no hope
of achieving victory.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.515
Then let's change
the name of Bolivia.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.853
After all, Simén Bolivar
was a Venezuelan, right?

23:57.729 --> 23:59.439
Comrade Monje...

23:59.647 --> 24:02.859
...your job and the party's job is to
make it clear to the people that Che...

24:03.484 --> 24:07.614
...that Ramon, is a revolutionary
from the continent, not a foreigner.

24:07.947 --> 24:11.284
It's true.
Ramén is like Simén Bolivar.

24:12.285 --> 24:15.330
The party does not
endorse armed struggle.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.957
You are free to abandon it.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.670
And you will have
our support ifyou do.

24:23.463 --> 24:28.676
Ifyou stay, the party will no longer
pay your stipends.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.638
As the head
of the Communist Party here...

24:31.804 --> 24:33.681
...l advise you to leave with me.

24:43.316 --> 24:46.527
With a mojito,
you cannot grind up the leaves.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.238
-L know about mojitos...
- So you know you can't grind them up.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.574
You cannot grind the leaves.

25:01.542 --> 25:02.460
How are you?

25:03.503 --> 25:06.422
Come over.
just a second, I'm finishing here.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.675
Then you have to cover it.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.635
Half an hour in the oven
with the correct temperature.

25:10.802 --> 25:14.514
No, I forgot something -
on top of the cream, put cheese.

25:14.722 --> 25:15.723
Cheese.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.851
Excuse us for a second.
We need to talk.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.269
Go ahead.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.691
- Everything good?
- Yes, good.

25:26.275 --> 25:29.362
Why did Che change
the location of the camp?

25:30.363 --> 25:32.865
I think he wanted
to be closer to Argentina.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.285
He had contacts
waiting for him in Alto Beni.

25:37.286 --> 25:41.207
The mines are there.
Miners are more politicized.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.376
They support us.

25:44.252 --> 25:48.381
Che needed somewhere
to train for six months...

25:48.548 --> 25:50.466
...where he wouldn't be bothered.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.346
How is that Nancahuazfl region?

25:57.265 --> 26:02.395
It's a very remote place.
Life is hard there.

26:03.521 --> 26:06.816
In fact,
the few peasants who live there...

26:07.734 --> 26:09.902
...don't trust foreigners.

26:12.321 --> 26:16.451
The Soviets won't allow Monje
to make a deal.

26:16.909 --> 26:17.869
No.

26:20.580 --> 26:25.251
We have some money
that we want you to take to Bolivia.

26:26.669 --> 26:29.547
And we need to find out if
there's anything else...

26:30.506 --> 26:32.258
...that we need to send.

26:34.552 --> 26:37.430
We also found a cave
which could be useful.

26:38.890 --> 26:39.891
Good morning.

26:41.726 --> 26:45.438
I told the men that I'm going back
to La Paz today.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.608
L'm resigning from the party.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.444
My mission...

26:51.944 --> 26:53.446
...is over.

26:53.988 --> 26:56.449
- Okay.
- The jeep arrives this afternoon.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.954
Why don't you stay in the camp
until thejeep arrives?

27:02.413 --> 27:03.831
I would like to be alone.

27:04.832 --> 27:07.293
L'll wait at the zinc house.

27:07.585 --> 27:08.628
Fine.

27:09.337 --> 27:14.550
L'll return onjanuary 10th,
with my decision made.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.846
Okay. Monje, we'll be here.

27:25.895 --> 27:29.649
Coco, find Moisés Guevara.

27:30.358 --> 27:31.984
Tell him I want to talk to him.

27:32.777 --> 27:36.906
We're leaving in a few days
on a training march...

27:37.907 --> 27:40.618
...for about 20, 25 days.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.498
L'll go to the mines.

27:45.873 --> 27:49.585
L'll be back between the 4th and
14th of February.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.506
I'd like to come back earlier,
but it's Carnival season...

27:53.840 --> 27:56.050
...La Diablada in Oruro.

27:56.843 --> 28:00.012
My men will be all spread out,
it'll be difficult to gather them.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.893
You are our primary
connection to the outside.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.063
Your cover needs to remain intact.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.941
You can't come back to the camp.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.903
There may be a strike at Siglo XX.

28:19.532 --> 28:20.867
And your husband?

28:21.617 --> 28:24.078
How are things? Did you
get the trip straightened out?

28:24.537 --> 28:27.790
I arranged everything so that
he could go study in Bulgaria.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.377
What about Barrientos?
What happened there?

28:32.753 --> 28:34.505
We've been in contact.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.552
- What happened?
-l think he likes me.

28:40.428 --> 28:41.971
I know he likes me.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.560
- Should I try to see him again?
- Yes.

28:48.811 --> 28:52.398
Tania, when this thing heats up...

28:53.566 --> 28:55.693
...your job will make the difference.

28:59.363 --> 29:03.075
Here are provisions -
sugar, eggs, flour- what's needed.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.960
The new employee, is he Bolivian?

29:13.794 --> 29:14.837
Yes.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.673
- How much do I owe you?
- No, keep your money.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.718
- No, keep it.
- We are neighbors now.

29:21.636 --> 29:23.721
- Take it.
-l'm not doing this for the money.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.938
I want to take part in your project.

29:32.521 --> 29:37.526
I have relatives in transportation.
You can rely on me for everything.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.820
Okay?

29:40.154 --> 29:42.865
Go with Tuma to see our neighbor...

29:44.492 --> 29:48.579
...and tell him we need his help.
Involve him without offering much.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.668
Tell him that we'll pay
for what he carries in thejeep...

29:54.460 --> 29:55.753
...and nothing else.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.463
Tumaini.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.882
Put a little fear in him.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.969
And explain to him that if he
betrays us he'll pay with his life.

30:04.762 --> 30:06.931
You can drive back and forth
to town in yourjeep...

30:07.139 --> 30:10.935
...so you can buy the food we need
and we'll pay you well.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.604
Yes, sure, whatever you want.

30:14.021 --> 30:17.733
- Good.
-l have to tell you something.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.862
In private, because it's something
I would only say to a friend.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.656
Okay, fine.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.637
You want some more?

30:50.016 --> 30:52.768
There were two
little birds who lived in a tree.

30:53.853 --> 30:58.190
One was quiet, the other liked to
fluff his feathers, and sing and sing.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.819
One day a hunter came by.

31:02.611 --> 31:06.949
He heard him sing,
then put him in his sights and shot.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.870
But the other bird, the quiet one,
nothing happened to him.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.997
He saved his own life.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.249
It's a nice story.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.793
-It's good.
-lt's good. I liked it.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.087
I really liked it.
I know what you mean.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.646
You junkie son of a bitch.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.191
We'll see.

31:54.997 --> 31:55.998
Good morning.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.584
- How are you?
- Good morning.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.003
This looks beautiful!

32:03.089 --> 32:05.841
I see the factory is doing well.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.139
- Good morning.
- Come with me.

32:14.934 --> 32:17.269
Can we come in? Show me the house.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.609
I see you are really busy.

32:26.946 --> 32:30.991
Soon. I don't know when, but soon...

32:31.325 --> 32:33.786
...we will confront the enemy.

32:35.621 --> 32:39.291
Our contact
with the outside will be limited.

32:41.919 --> 32:46.632
Some of us will die, and it's
sad to see your comrades die...

32:49.051 --> 32:51.846
...because you can't help them
with your limited resources.

32:53.681 --> 32:55.182
Food will be scarce.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.019
Sometimes we won't have
anything to eat.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.692
And if all of this weren't enough...

33:05.109 --> 33:08.821
...we'll have to
endure the harsh weather.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.200
By the end...

33:14.076 --> 33:16.245
...we will have become human waste.

33:17.121 --> 33:19.290
That's all I can promise you.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.750
Think it over.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.339
You still have time to go back home.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.050
Afterwards it will be too late.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.054
In closing...

33:36.348 --> 33:38.934
...l would like to repeat...

33:40.853 --> 33:42.688
...what I said to Monje.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.109
Me? I'm already here.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.697
They would have to kill me
to get me out of here.

33:52.364 --> 33:56.869
I will be at the side
of those who stay, until victory.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.621
How much corn can you
sell us right now?

34:42.748 --> 34:45.083
There's not even enough for us, sir.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.253
At least sell us a pig.

34:47.795 --> 34:52.174
They're piglets,just little ones.
How am I going to sell them?

34:52.382 --> 34:54.092
Besides, they belong to the missus.

34:54.802 --> 34:57.012
How much is your pig, madam?

34:57.763 --> 35:00.808
I can't sell them,
they're only sucklings.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.686
L'll pay you 30,000 bolivianos.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.355
L'm not sure.

35:07.815 --> 35:09.275
How about 40,000?

35:09.775 --> 35:12.278
Should we sell or not?

35:14.154 --> 35:16.115
Make it 50,000, okay?

35:16.949 --> 35:18.075
Okay-

35:19.118 --> 35:21.078
What conditions do they live in?

35:21.954 --> 35:23.998
Very bad.

35:26.041 --> 35:27.167
Do they have children?

35:27.626 --> 35:32.381
They have six kids.
Barefoot, all full of ticks.

35:33.257 --> 35:36.427
One of the little boys
has a badly infected eye.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.804
How old is the peasant?

35:39.638 --> 35:43.058
About 40, 50 years old.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.936
I think he's a bit older, you know?

35:48.981 --> 35:52.443
And when you offered the money,
how did he react?

35:53.235 --> 35:55.821
His eyes sparkled
when he saw the money.

35:56.739 --> 35:57.990
Hello.

35:59.158 --> 36:00.659
Good day, Honorato.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.380
Come, I want to talk to you.

36:17.134 --> 36:19.845
We want there
to be schools for your children...

36:20.763 --> 36:23.098
...and hospitals to take care of them...

36:24.016 --> 36:25.309
...and roads to be built...

36:25.726 --> 36:28.437
...so trucks can reach here
and you can sell your products.

36:30.022 --> 36:32.358
Don't you want all these things?

36:33.192 --> 36:35.194
Well, yes, that would be nice.

36:35.903 --> 36:38.781
But in order to do this,
we need your help.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.124
Two...

36:50.167 --> 36:51.210
...and three.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.253
Look

36:55.798 --> 36:57.257
You are a big man.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.093
May God repay you.

36:59.385 --> 37:02.429
-It's all right.
- May God repay you.

37:08.352 --> 37:09.520
Okay-

37:10.729 --> 37:13.399
- See you.
- Bye, madam.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.277
- Goodbye.
- May God repay you.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.434
What are you doing?

38:33.312 --> 38:35.022
That's communal food.

38:37.107 --> 38:39.568
No one helps themselves without
being given permission to do so.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.153
Understood?

38:42.905 --> 38:45.449
I'll let you off this one time
because you don't know the rules yet.

38:46.158 --> 38:49.828
- Everything belongs to the group.
- But we're hungry.

38:50.329 --> 38:54.917
We're all hungry, Dario.
But one can feeds six for breakfast.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.430
There's one missing.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.871
I have no radio coverage
with the main camp so I'm going back.

39:33.330 --> 39:35.874
No, big guy.
You're not going anywhere.

39:36.708 --> 39:40.337
Stay with us until six, then you
can tell Ramén how far we've gone.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.214
No, I'm going now
while it's still light out.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.716
Hey, I'm giving you an order!

39:45.259 --> 39:46.760
Stay here until six.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.558
-L'm leaving now.
- You're not leaving, can't you hear?

39:52.724 --> 39:54.309
You listen to me, I'm fucking going.

39:54.476 --> 39:56.562
You'll have to
go through my machete first!

39:56.853 --> 39:58.814
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

39:59.189 --> 40:00.857
Hey, Miguel!

40:01.233 --> 40:02.859
What's going on here?

40:03.569 --> 40:05.487
Listen, listen!

40:05.654 --> 40:07.281
Miguel, look at me!

40:07.447 --> 40:08.907
Hey, you're comrades.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.243
“Comrades” for what?
He has to follow orders!

40:11.410 --> 40:11.910
That's enough!

40:12.744 --> 40:15.622
Miguel, you have to control yourself...

40:16.582 --> 40:18.750
...and give orders with respect...

40:19.835 --> 40:21.378
...like a boss.

40:22.838 --> 40:26.592
You cannot threaten
or hit anyone here.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.429
That's not
permitted by the guerrilla.

40:31.388 --> 40:33.807
And you know that better than anyone.

40:35.475 --> 40:36.935
And you...

40:38.770 --> 40:40.522
...lied.

40:41.648 --> 40:46.278
Miguel never hit you with the machete
handle. He didn't even touch you.

40:48.447 --> 40:50.699
The one thing I won't tolerate here...

40:51.241 --> 40:52.826
...is a liar!

40:53.535 --> 40:55.787
One more incident like that, Pacho...

40:56.455 --> 40:59.625
...and I'll send you back to Cuba
with a dishonorable discharge.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.632
Incidents like this destroy group
morale and our readiness for combat...

41:06.882 --> 41:09.259
...not only of you, or you...

41:09.551 --> 41:11.261
...but of the entire group.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.515
If anyone feels weak or discouraged...

41:17.559 --> 41:19.770
...he shouldn't resort to such methods...

41:21.605 --> 41:25.484
...but should speak to the political
commissaries, to lnti or Rolando...

41:25.692 --> 41:26.943
...OI' to me...

41:27.903 --> 41:30.280
...and we will peacefully discharge him
from the group.

42:00.811 --> 42:03.939
I didn't come here to work.
We should have a rifle.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.739
Listen to me.

42:13.865 --> 42:17.744
Ramén could be back now
in Cuba with his family...

42:18.870 --> 42:23.542
...with many cars, enjoying comfort
everywhere he goes.

42:23.834 --> 42:28.004
But he is here because he
wants you to have a better life...

42:29.047 --> 42:31.383
...so your kids
can learn to read and write.

42:33.301 --> 42:36.722
I'm just a baker,
I've been a slave all my life...

42:37.889 --> 42:39.850
...but some day I'll be free.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.275
Rest because
we'll be leaving at sunrise.

42:48.692 --> 42:51.695
- We're not staying here?
- No, we need to be patient.

42:51.945 --> 42:55.282
We are taking you to another
camp where you'll be safer.

42:55.741 --> 42:57.492
Have you had any problems?

42:57.951 --> 43:00.996
There's a neighbor that thinks
we're making cocaine.

43:02.330 --> 43:04.583
The police have
been here twice already.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.300
When's the last time
you heard from Ramén?

43:13.675 --> 43:15.469
Over a week ago.

43:16.261 --> 43:17.971
We lost contact with the whole group.

43:20.724 --> 43:22.684
Moisés, hello!

43:28.315 --> 43:29.649
Who did you bring?

43:29.900 --> 43:33.361
Contacts from Argentina and France.
Chino is from Pen].

43:36.448 --> 43:37.783
Are you going back to Camiri?

43:38.325 --> 43:40.410
I need to talk to Ramén first.

43:41.286 --> 43:44.289
Monje and the Party
are interfering with everything.

43:44.790 --> 43:48.752
They even convinced the last
Bolivians that were trained in Cuba...

43:49.002 --> 43:52.005
...not to come here and join us.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.343
Hey, listen.

43:56.968 --> 43:57.969
He)'-

43:58.470 --> 43:59.971
Everyone keep away from her hammock.

44:00.347 --> 44:02.891
Whoever touches her will
be severely punished.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.645
Listen to me, Arturo.

44:08.688 --> 44:11.942
They are Bolivian,
and they have come to fight.

44:12.484 --> 44:14.319
You must not disrespect them.

44:24.079 --> 44:28.375
I need two volunteers to go hunt
and I thought about you.

44:30.544 --> 44:34.589
Bring something good
because supplies are running low.

44:37.592 --> 44:41.847
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
We'll get money for this!

45:56.880 --> 45:58.590
Hey, that sounds like a plane.

46:00.008 --> 46:01.468
Airplane!

46:03.845 --> 46:05.180
Come on, Ramén.

46:12.103 --> 46:13.605
Get down, Ramén.

46:41.091 --> 46:44.177
They caught two of Moisés' men
who deserted...

46:44.636 --> 46:46.096
...and they talked like parrots.

46:46.513 --> 46:48.640
Soldiers went into the zinc house.

46:48.974 --> 46:51.726
They seized Tania's jeep and a mule.

46:51.935 --> 46:54.646
- Who gave orders to move camp?
- Antonio did.

46:54.854 --> 46:56.898
Tell him we'll win the war with bullets.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.151
- Bring back all to the camp.
- Okay.

47:00.819 --> 47:01.987
Rolando.

47:03.822 --> 47:05.865
Prepare an ambush.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.915
Was there anything in thejeep?

47:15.333 --> 47:18.837
I had some
recordings of Fidel's speeches.

47:21.047 --> 47:24.009
They're going to search thejeep
which will lead them to the hotel...

47:24.259 --> 47:26.845
...and the hotel will lead
them to your apartment...

47:27.929 --> 47:30.056
...and your apartment will
lead them to everything.

47:31.099 --> 47:33.018
I couldn't trust anyone.

47:35.061 --> 47:38.023
Every time I called
they hung up the phone on me.

47:38.314 --> 47:44.696
- That's why I decided to bring...
- You had strict orders not to return.

47:45.739 --> 47:49.826
That's five yea rs of lost work.

47:51.036 --> 47:52.704
Tania, five!

47:53.830 --> 47:55.081
Give me your rifle.

47:57.208 --> 48:00.754
You and the visitors will leave
as soon as we prepare your trip.

48:42.295 --> 48:44.005
Hold your fire!

48:44.881 --> 48:48.259
We surrender! We surrender!

48:52.013 --> 48:54.766
My superiors are cowards
and don't tell us anything.

48:55.809 --> 48:59.187
I didn't want to be here. I swear.

48:59.354 --> 49:00.897
Calm down.

49:01.272 --> 49:04.859
- Please don't kill me, please.
- Calm down.

49:08.154 --> 49:09.948
I suffer from rheumatism, I swear.

49:10.115 --> 49:11.908
- Listen, no one is going to hurt you.
- And I have a bad heart.

49:12.909 --> 49:16.037
Don't believe a word Major Plata says.
He's a liar and he's abusive.

49:16.287 --> 49:19.457
He sells our food to the stores
and keeps the money for himself.

49:19.916 --> 49:24.420
He hits people.
Look how he's crying. He's a coward.

49:25.463 --> 49:27.423
So what should we do with him?

49:28.091 --> 49:29.467
Kill him.

49:30.969 --> 49:33.263
Yes, kill him.

49:35.265 --> 49:37.308
Put him on his side.

49:39.310 --> 49:42.313
- Did you give him a painkiller?
- Not yet.

49:44.065 --> 49:45.441
Give him some morphine.

49:46.484 --> 49:49.279
We have committed
ourselves to a struggle...

49:50.155 --> 49:53.491
...in which, whether we
like it or not, we may have to kill...

49:55.034 --> 49:59.831
...or be killed because we are
fighting for Bolivia's freedom.

50:01.833 --> 50:05.003
You can do it now.

50:12.886 --> 50:15.388
I won't be returning.
I'm quitting the army.

50:18.224 --> 50:20.977
We hope to see you soon.

50:22.187 --> 50:25.857
Because we could use more
ofyour ammunitions and weapons.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.156
Long live a free Bolivia!

50:33.364 --> 50:35.533
Long live
the National Liberation Army!

50:45.126 --> 50:47.003
No one wanted to stay.

50:48.463 --> 50:49.964
That takes time.

52:17.760 --> 52:21.306
No, ifyou leave now
you could be arrested.

52:21.639 --> 52:25.476
I think you should wait
until we start our march northward.

52:26.019 --> 52:28.313
- You're going north?
- Yes.

52:29.522 --> 52:32.567
Then we can let you off
on the Cochabamba road.

52:33.484 --> 52:37.155
No. I don't think that's right.
That could take two or three months.

52:37.363 --> 52:39.991
Ciro, we're at war.

52:42.285 --> 52:43.911
Give me a guide.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.289
Give me a guide and <i>l'll</i>
make the arrangements.

52:46.664 --> 52:49.334
I can't break up the group
under these circumstances.

52:50.585 --> 52:52.503
L'll think about an alternative.

52:53.296 --> 52:56.632
But any move we make will be made
with the group as a whole.

53:07.560 --> 53:10.521
Ramén, your books are soaked.

53:11.147 --> 53:13.274
Put them on
those rocks to dry.

53:18.404 --> 53:19.530
Arturo.

53:20.031 --> 53:22.408
Water got in the radio,
everything is rusted.

53:23.618 --> 53:26.162
What are you saying,
that it doesn't work?

53:26.454 --> 53:28.539
It still receives,
but it doesn't send.

53:33.961 --> 53:35.713
Shit. Now we're really screwed.

53:36.464 --> 53:41.344
Not quite, we still have
the visitors to relay messages.

53:45.973 --> 53:48.726
The army says that you are
here to practice Communism.

53:49.560 --> 53:52.563
That you have no God,
that you all work for the State.

53:53.481 --> 53:56.984
That you rape women and
destroy families.

53:57.693 --> 54:01.406
You kill those who refuse to serve you
and want to make us slaves.

54:02.448 --> 54:04.409
And what kind of freedom do you have?

54:04.742 --> 54:06.327
The kind where
I can do whatever I want.

54:06.619 --> 54:10.456
Listen to me.
None of what they said is true.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.750
We haven't come to harm anybody.

54:13.292 --> 54:16.295
We just want to buy
some food from you, that's all.

54:16.587 --> 54:19.298
But I have nothing, only this.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.761
How much do you want for this?

54:25.012 --> 54:27.348
Whatever you have - take it.

54:29.100 --> 54:32.645
L'll stay ifyou need me.

54:34.230 --> 54:38.234
What I need now are peasants.

54:40.528 --> 54:44.031
It's better if you go to France and
make a network to promote our cause...

54:44.615 --> 54:48.661
...so they can send us money,
medicine and radios.

54:51.205 --> 54:54.417
I'd also need you to take
some messages to Cuba.

54:56.461 --> 55:02.717
L'll write Sartre and Bertrand Russell
to organize a worldwide fund...

55:03.801 --> 55:06.262
...on behalf
of the Bolivian revolution.

55:18.483 --> 55:20.109
Don't worry.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.820
We'll take you out
of here when you recover.

55:25.281 --> 55:27.408
L'm not worried.

55:35.625 --> 55:36.834
Tumaini.

55:47.678 --> 55:49.222
Here, it's yours.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.516
To protect you.

56:01.776 --> 56:06.572
L'll move southward with the vanguard
and take the visitors out by Muyupampa.

56:08.115 --> 56:10.660
I want you to stay
with the sick until we come back.

56:11.369 --> 56:13.204
How long will you be gone?

56:13.621 --> 56:15.039
About three days.

56:55.621 --> 56:56.831
Rolando.

56:57.331 --> 56:59.917
Go with Loro to replace
Benigno and Miguel.

57:01.460 --> 57:02.753
Ramén.

57:03.546 --> 57:04.797
There's no one in the house.

57:05.214 --> 57:07.925
So leave the money with a note.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.661
Pick up everything, we're leaving.

57:46.339 --> 57:47.298
Ramén.

57:50.718 --> 57:52.303
There's no sign of Loro.

58:00.645 --> 58:02.521
That's what they've given me, Captain.

58:03.481 --> 58:04.649
What good is this for?

58:05.441 --> 58:06.901
Are there any shops here?

58:08.694 --> 58:11.405
They took my pigs and my corn.

58:13.824 --> 58:17.286
You helped them
and they gave you money.

58:17.536 --> 58:20.915
Now you are going
to help us eliminate them, otherwise...

58:21.415 --> 58:24.418
And now you are stealing
my chickens, Captain.

58:25.336 --> 58:28.506
Listen to me closely,
smart ass, really pay attention.

58:29.340 --> 58:33.844
Let me know immediately
if the guerrillas come back again.

58:34.512 --> 58:36.972
You have a good heart.

58:38.349 --> 58:39.850
you'll do it.

59:54.049 --> 59:55.426
Good morning.

59:56.969 --> 01:00:02.308
L'm just here to write an article on the
guerrilla movement in Bolivia.

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:08.773
Trying to confirm
the Bolivian Army's rumors...

01:00:09.899 --> 01:00:13.068
...that Che Guevara
is the leader of the group...

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:16.572
...and there is a woman with him.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:20.534
This guy is a Trojan horse.

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:25.539
I don't want
any Cubans talking to him.

01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:34.423
- What's up, Dario?
- Food is ready.

01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:37.635
Start serving. Children first.

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:42.473
Are you from Paraguay?

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.393
Paraguay? No way, I'm from Oruro.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:49.563
Okay, kids.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:53.025
Once you are done you
have to leave, right?

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:56.821
We can't leave because that
gringo owes us money.

01:00:57.071 --> 01:00:59.490
How much does he owe you?

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:01.075
5O pesos.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.715
I spoke with the Englishman
about the way out.

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:21.470
He says the army knows him in Camiri.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:25.808
We could get out that way.

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:29.812
You are the ones
to make that decision.

01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:35.442
We could use our papers
to pass as reporters, no problem.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:44.410
Inti will take you
up the road to Camiri.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.621
Try not to go through Muyupampa.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:50.624
Don't get yourselves captured.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:54.753
If that happens remember to
always deny my presence...

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:59.091
...and the presence of all Cubans
here at each moment and at all costs.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:04.054
- Do you have a cigarette?
- No, I don't.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.098
Goddamn it!

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:09.727
Why don't you smoke?
Smoking's great.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.104
But I do have some tobacco.

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:14.690
Thanks, brother.

01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:18.027
Where are the Cubans?

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.571
- Well, they should be...
- Darl'o, come here!

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.244
I told you not to talk to that guy!

01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:28.787
What did he say?

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:32.249
He didn't say anything, brother.
I asked him for a cigarette.

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.084
You're going to the back.

01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:14.625
Freeze! Stop right there!

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:17.544
Drop your backpacks
and show us your papers, shitheads!

01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:21.548
Throw them on the ground.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.260
The Frenchman's name is Regis Debray.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:29.723
Masquerades as a radical author,
a Marxist journalist.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:33.769
Spends a lot of time in Cuba,
and is a good friend of Fidel Castro.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.606
The Argentine's name is Ciro Bustos.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:39.525
A painter, and also a writer.

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:43.153
This character collected money in 1963...

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:47.032
...for a local guerrilla
movement led byjorge Massetti.

01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:51.245
Massetti was killed
by the police in Argentina in 1964.

01:04:21.734 --> 01:04:24.903
<i>Two mercenaries, a Frenchman
and an Argentine were killed...</i>

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:28.532
<i>...when confronted by the army in
the area known as Vaca Guzman.</i>

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:31.535
The Guzmén region,
that's in Muyupampa.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.791
If that's true, those bastards
are going to pay for it, big time.

01:04:47.968 --> 01:04:51.013
The three of them were arrested.
They were taken to Camiri.

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:52.556
Who told you that?

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:55.559
We stopped a van that
came from Muyupampa...

01:04:55.809 --> 01:05:00.064
...with a German priest and a man.
They gave all the information.

01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:04.860
They want to talk to the boss.
They gave us some sweets and stuff.

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:08.572
-Inti, have those people seen you?
- No.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.211
Many ofyour men are not Bolivian.

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:25.005
That's why no one trusts you.

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.049
But they trust you.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:31.220
They asked us to talk to you.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:36.016
Then tell them that our army is
open to anyone who wants to fight...

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.602
...they should be here with us.

01:05:38.894 --> 01:05:41.897
No, they reject everything that
has to do with violence.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:46.777
So, people in power can
use violence to oppress us...

01:05:47.236 --> 01:05:49.947
...but we can't
use it to free ourselves?

01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:52.825
They don't want to join you
and they don't want you here.

01:05:53.117 --> 01:05:56.036
You don't have
the right to ruin their lives.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.379
You are going to have peace
today in Muyupampa...

01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:09.174
...on the condition that you bring us
a truck of food and medical goods...

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.385
...by 6 p.m. on this watch.

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:16.014
We'll meet at Nemesio's farm.
We'll pay for everything.

01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:19.726
Then we'll go; you have my word.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:22.271
Okay-

01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:25.941
Open your mouth.

01:06:45.878 --> 01:06:48.172
They will torture Bustos and Debray.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.424
They'll learn everything.

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.306
Ramén.

01:06:58.307 --> 01:07:00.350
I think you should change your name.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.438
That's not a bad idea.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:11.695
Plane!

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:13.030
Get everyone out of the house.

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:14.698
- Run!
- Cover yourselves!

01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:18.035
Quickly, under the tree!

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:19.453
Get out of here!

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:30.380
Most of these men are Cubans.
Don't be mistaken.

01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:35.844
This is an invasion
promoted by Castro.

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:44.394
A Communist plot to remove a peaceful,
democratically elected government.

01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:47.397
President Barrientos,
what about the Americans?

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:50.817
Are there U.S. military advisors?

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:55.322
The United States has sent planes,
helicopters and nothing more.

01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:58.867
That's their response
to the guerrilla threat?

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:05.040
Our military is entirely capable
of handling this situation.

01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:09.044
The guerrilla forces
are on their last legs.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:13.131
Is Che Guevara leading this group?

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:18.386
I'll say it once.
Che Guevara is not in Bolivia.

01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:33.944
Fernando.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.073
The miners are threatening
to go on strike.

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:42.868
Where?

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.496
In Catavi, Siglo XX.

01:08:45.413 --> 01:08:47.374
The miners are going on strike!

01:09:16.278 --> 01:09:19.488
Miners have pledged 5O bolivianos
of their paychecks to our cause.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.328
For them, that's a fortune.

01:09:27.331 --> 01:09:30.042
Arturo,
report to Miguel at the ambush...

01:09:30.459 --> 01:09:32.169
...and replace Pablito.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.215
L'll go through all of Bolivia
without firing a single shot.

01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:38.508
Okay-

01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:43.346
Sir, the situation is slipping
through our fingers.

01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:46.183
The Pope and de Gaulle are
pressuring us about Debray.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:50.354
Some members ofyour coalition are
expressing support for the strike...

01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:52.481
...and sympathy for the rebel cause.

01:09:52.898 --> 01:09:55.108
We need to
take control of this thing.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:58.070
What do you have in mind?

01:09:58.570 --> 01:09:59.863
Tell people about Guevara.

01:10:00.072 --> 01:10:03.533
Declare a state of emergency and
crack down on the Siglo XX miners...

01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:05.202
...the iron fist.

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:09.081
Seal the borders and declare
a national state of war.

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:11.416
And the rebels?

01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:14.503
Your main problem,
Mr. President, is the lack...

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:17.047
...of coordination
among your deployed forces.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.549
I couldn't agree more, sir.

01:10:21.385 --> 01:10:22.636
What do you suggest?

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.389
Divide the region in three zones.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:28.683
Surround each zone,
cut off its source of supply...

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:31.561
...and liquidate any guerrilla forces.

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.610
<i>A few minutes ago,
Radio Argentina reported...</i>

01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:42.030
<i>...the sad news about
the Siglo XX massacre...</i>

01:10:42.197 --> 01:10:45.534
<i>...which resulted in the deaths
of 87 miners.</i>

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:49.287
<i>The families and fellow miners
mourn their loss.</i>

01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:52.457
What are they saying
on Bolivian stations?

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:54.709
The same.

01:10:55.377 --> 01:10:58.630
They confirm the battle in the mines,
but they are silent about the death toll.

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:17.732
They hit Pombo.

01:11:19.443 --> 01:11:21.236
They almost got us, man.

01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:42.299
Pour me some water.

01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:57.314
Come on, breathe.

01:12:15.499 --> 01:12:16.750
The worst is over.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:45.570
He asked that you hold his watch
until you can give it to his son.

01:12:58.667 --> 01:12:59.709
Joaquin.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.796
We can't circle it forever.

01:13:03.255 --> 01:13:05.215
This place is crawling with troops.

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:10.345
Ramén told us
not to move out of the area.

01:13:10.679 --> 01:13:13.807
That was before
the army overran our camp.

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:17.394
We have no food left - nothing.

01:13:17.561 --> 01:13:19.771
If Ramén were
coming back, he'd be here by now.

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:23.275
If we leave,
how are we going to meet him?

01:13:24.109 --> 01:13:26.695
If Ramén is not here it's
because the army is preventing him.

01:13:28.822 --> 01:13:31.491
I say we find
our way to the Rio Grande.

01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:36.162
We've got as much chance finding
Ramén across the river...

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.582
...as we do here.

01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:58.310
Good morning, miss.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:00.562
Can you sell me a can of milk?

01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:04.441
Ricardo, what's up?

01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:07.861
- Shut up and give me your canteen.
- Moron!

01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:24.461
Breathe! Now hold it.

01:14:24.711 --> 01:14:26.379
- Fuck!
- Calm down.

01:14:26.588 --> 01:14:27.631
Hold it!

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:47.317
Breathe.

01:15:06.378 --> 01:15:08.838
How long are we going to
look for these people?

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:11.675
Until we find them.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:15.929
I agree, but I think
we're moving away from them.

01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:19.265
We should try to make contact
with the capital again.

01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:21.726
We're at an impasse.

01:15:22.477 --> 01:15:25.271
How many more of us have to die
to find the other group?

01:15:25.939 --> 01:15:30.402
Chapaco, if you were lost,
we'd do the same thing.

01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:35.240
No one abandons anyone in the group.

01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:37.534
Is that clear?

01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:40.954
Let's go.

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:34.591
Excuse me, Fernando...

01:16:37.469 --> 01:16:39.429
...but the men are starving...

01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:42.015
...and we have nothing to give them.

01:16:42.724 --> 01:16:46.853
We also have nothing for the animals.
They're eating the bark off the trees.

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:49.564
- What do you want me to do?
- Kill a horse.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:59.574
L'm giving you another shot.

01:17:31.523 --> 01:17:33.483
Fernando, with your permission.

01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:41.074
I think I could...

01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:45.328
...make it back to the camp
to look for your medicines.

01:17:47.372 --> 01:17:48.665
What do you want?

01:17:49.541 --> 01:17:51.501
Do you want me
to divide the group again?

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.128
L'm not doing it.

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:58.758
And even less, risk anyone's life...

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.427
...for the sake of my own well-being.

01:19:04.449 --> 01:19:08.077
We are in a difficult situation.

01:19:08.912 --> 01:19:11.164
The truth is, all of us...

01:19:12.165 --> 01:19:13.917
...have made mistakes.

01:19:14.876 --> 01:19:16.586
But I made the worst mistake...

01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:20.590
...when I didn't
bring my medicines along.

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:24.761
This struggle gives us...

01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:28.056
...the opportunity to become...

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:31.768
...true revolutionaries,
the highest level...

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.937
...of humanity.

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:37.857
To become men...

01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:42.111
...in the purest sense of the word.

01:19:44.948 --> 01:19:46.866
Too old to learn.

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:50.495
If the wheel rolls downhill...

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:53.206
...let it go.

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:13.226
Come on, let's go up.

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:18.189
Let's go!

01:20:24.988 --> 01:20:27.699
- Let's go!
- No, I can hold them!

01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:29.617
GQ!

01:20:34.914 --> 01:20:36.165
You bastards!

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:45.842
They're reporting three hours
of intense combat in Monteagudo...

01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:49.137
...between a group of guerrillas
and the 3rd division.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:54.475
The army didn't
suffer any casualties.

01:20:54.726 --> 01:20:56.436
Here's Monteagudo.

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:00.189
They are talking
about one dead guerrilla...

01:21:00.648 --> 01:21:02.025
...named Antonio Fernéndez from Tarata.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.944
Pombo, sounds like it was Pedro.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.904
He's from Tarata.

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:09.866
Monteagudo is here.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:14.912
- Where exactly?~
- Here, south of Nancahuaztn.

01:21:24.714 --> 01:21:27.550
This is wherejoaquin
and his group are operating.

01:21:29.761 --> 01:21:32.472
- So, what we're hearing makes sense.
- We're not far off.

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:39.062
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:42.065
With your permission,
I need to check your house.

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.193
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:49.155
Hello, madam.

01:21:50.615 --> 01:21:51.783
Good afternoon.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.626
Don't worry, madam,
we won't do you any harm.

01:22:03.503 --> 01:22:04.754
Who's that man over there?

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:08.132
- Sit down.
- No, thanks.

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:11.803
<i>- Who is that man?
- Oh, he's a friend...</i>

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:12.970
ls he all right?

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.264
<i>Have you seen the army around here?</i>

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.935
He's a neighbor. He has a fever.

01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:22.105
We have a doctor with us.

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:26.234
We'll bring him to see you
when we come back.

01:22:27.568 --> 01:22:28.611
Do you understand me?

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:30.530
<i>...but what about the army?</i>

01:22:32.949 --> 01:22:35.618
We need to find a way
across the river, a ford.

01:22:35.827 --> 01:22:38.538
You live here and you know
this area well. You can help us.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.627
Get us some food.

01:22:45.086 --> 01:22:46.671
There, have some money.

01:22:46.963 --> 01:22:49.966
You are seven people, right?
And eight with the woman.

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:53.219
How do you know that we're seven?

01:22:55.138 --> 01:22:58.641
L'm slowing everyone down.
I don't know if I'll be able to go on.

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:01.227
Of course you can, Tania.

01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:04.272
We'll be back in two days.

01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:12.738
Remember, sir, find us an easy place
to cross the river.

01:24:11.881 --> 01:24:14.300
Pombo, I've got to talk to Fernando.

01:24:14.884 --> 01:24:16.385
Fernando is sleeping.

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:17.970
He's recovering
from an asthma attack.

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:20.890
Don't you think
he's had enough worries for today?

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:22.391
Let him rest.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.186
Inti, what's the matter?

01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:27.438
Okay, go and tell him.

01:24:33.361 --> 01:24:36.280
I think you should speak to
Camba and Chapaco.

01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:39.992
Camba says his physical condition
prevents him from continuing.

01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:44.163
I think he no longer
sees the point of the struggle.

01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:47.917
I talked to lnti already.

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:53.422
Fernando, I am a bit sick.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.175
-L don't believe...
- Camba.

01:24:57.343 --> 01:25:01.055
I can't let you go
until we meetjoaquin's group...

01:25:02.348 --> 01:25:04.100
...because if they capture you...

01:25:04.892 --> 01:25:06.852
...you not only risk your own life...

01:25:07.186 --> 01:25:10.815
...but you also put the whole group at risk.

01:25:13.192 --> 01:25:14.777
Look, Camba.

01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:17.947
To survive here, to win...

01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:21.450
...you have to live
as if you've already died.

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:32.962
I never said to lnti
that I wanted to quit.

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.465
Quitting is for cowards.

01:25:38.843 --> 01:25:43.014
What I told lnti is that in six months
to a year, I want to return home.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.986
Let's see.

01:25:58.821 --> 01:25:59.989
Tell me...

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:05.244
...exactly where you said to cross.

01:26:07.121 --> 01:26:10.374
Just about here is where
I will make them cross, captain.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.092
Now...

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:25.431
...put this white shirt on
so we don't shoot at you.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:30.186
Now go home and don't move...

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:35.024
...until the guerrillas arrive,
or they'll suspect something.

01:28:26.594 --> 01:28:27.636
Fire!

01:28:35.144 --> 01:28:40.983
<i>Today, the Bolivian A rm y reported
a rebel clash at Va do de/ Veso.</i>

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:44.403
<i>Ten rebels were reported killed.</i>

01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:49.408
<i>The group's one survivor, josé Carrillo,
is a local miner who was under...</i>

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:52.578
<i>...the command of a Cuban
named joaquin Acufia.</i>

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.122
That's bullshit from the army.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:57.208
They can't all be dead...

01:28:58.042 --> 01:29:00.211
...unless they were
walking in their sleep.

01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:02.713
José Carrillo is Paco.

01:29:03.297 --> 01:29:05.299
Maybe he was caught and is talking.

01:29:08.219 --> 01:29:09.011
Let's go.

01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:11.972
It's already five o'clock.

01:29:32.743 --> 01:29:35.704
- What happened to her face?
- The piranhas ate it.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:41.043
I requested a coffin.
There's a cemetery in town.

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:43.462
Mr. President,
with your permission, sir.

01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:46.340
What do you plan to do
with Che if he is captured alive?

01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:50.386
Personally, I think...

01:29:51.262 --> 01:29:53.389
...the biggest mistake Batista made...

01:29:53.764 --> 01:29:56.350
...was not killing Fidel
when he had the chance.

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:01.123
Thanks

01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:08.756
Fernando, they say the truck comes
every day, and the deputy...

01:31:09.298 --> 01:31:11.300
- What's his name?
- Vidal Aguilar...

01:31:11.467 --> 01:31:14.637
...left yesterday for Vallegrande
to warn the army about us.

01:31:15.137 --> 01:31:18.474
It's a two-day-old telegram
sent by the army to the deputy.

01:31:18.974 --> 01:31:21.727
It says:
“Any expenses incurred will be...

01:31:22.311 --> 01:31:24.688
...reimbursed by the army.”

01:31:25.731 --> 01:31:28.525
lnti is already talking to the wife.
They own a store.

01:31:29.068 --> 01:31:31.195
Tell lnti that in reprisal for that...

01:31:31.487 --> 01:31:33.739
...we will take all that
we need from the store.

01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:37.743
Take 1 O cans of sardines
and those tomatoes.

01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:43.165
This is for my children!

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.376
Madam, madam.

01:31:46.293 --> 01:31:51.674
<i>Dear comrades, we've been here
fighting the army for six months now.</i>

01:31:52.049 --> 01:31:53.509
<i>You may wonder why.</i>

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:58.180
<i>We want to
end injustice in this country.</i>

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:02.059
<i>To end neglect and misery...</i>

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:05.062
<i>...to which the government subjects
its own people.</i>

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:09.274
<i>For example,
where is the nearest hospital?</i>

01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:13.737
<i>About 100 kilometers away,
right? What if you get sick?</i>

01:32:14.196 --> 01:32:17.116
<i>First you have to pay
to take a truck to Vallegrande...</i>

01:32:17.366 --> 01:32:18.784
<i>...and then you pay for the stay.</i>

01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:22.121
<i>So you go to a hospital,
which they say is public...</i>

01:32:22.371 --> 01:32:25.124
<i>...but to see a doctor,
you must pay first.</i>

01:32:25.708 --> 01:32:27.292
<i>Isn't this the way it is?</i>

01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:32.297
<i>And the medicine? They won't even
give you aspirin for free.</i>

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:34.550
<i>In other words...</i>

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:39.555
<i>...if your kid gets sick or dies because
you have no money for the hospital...</i>

01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:42.391
<i>...who is going to care?</i>

01:32:43.225 --> 01:32:45.602
That is the reason why your
luck changing for the better...

01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:49.398
...depends on the triumph
of our struggle...

01:32:51.233 --> 01:32:52.234
Yes?

01:32:52.443 --> 01:32:54.737
Is there going
to be fighting here in the village?

01:32:57.614 --> 01:33:01.827
We have no intention of
fighting in the villages.

01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:48.791
Nothing.

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:51.460
Two pigs and a mule.

01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:54.463
- Weird, isn't it?
- You're telling me.

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:57.883
- Where is Miguel?
- He should already be here.

01:34:01.512 --> 01:34:02.471
He)'-

01:34:03.347 --> 01:34:05.390
Madam, madam!

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:08.268
Madam!

01:34:14.817 --> 01:34:16.527
I don't see anything.

01:34:17.444 --> 01:34:18.821
Absolute silence.

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:23.200
Smells like soldiers to me.

01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:26.328
It's completely deserted.

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:31.333
I talked to an old woman who said
that her grandson saw soldiers yesterday.

01:34:34.503 --> 01:34:35.546
Miguel.

01:34:36.922 --> 01:34:41.009
Get the vanguard ready to go
toJagUey at 1300 hours.

01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:43.679
You heard it.
The vanguard, get ready.

01:34:43.846 --> 01:34:46.598
Miguel, stay on guard.

01:34:47.516 --> 01:34:49.518
Take all security measures.

01:34:50.853 --> 01:34:51.895
Understood.

01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:01.029
- Tell me.
- Fernando...

01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:03.532
I think it's better that I stay here.

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.285
I can't stand up or pee.

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:10.372
We aren't going to leave you here.

01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:16.336
When we get tojagLiey,
we'll make a decision.

01:35:32.269 --> 01:35:33.437
Good afternoon.

01:35:33.687 --> 01:35:35.397
I met him on the way tojagijey.

01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:37.649
He says he comes from Vallegrande.

01:35:40.402 --> 01:35:42.029
Where are you going with these goods?

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:46.617
To Picacho, sir.
I have jerky and cheese to sell to...

01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:48.076
Pom bo, Pom bo.

01:35:48.744 --> 01:35:49.870
...support my family, sir.

01:35:50.037 --> 01:35:53.957
- Have you seen the army around?
- No, sir. I haven't seen the army.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:56.793
Fernando,
he looks too nervous to me.

01:35:57.044 --> 01:35:58.921
Maintain vigilance.

01:35:59.963 --> 01:36:02.591
Fall into line. Everyone, stay alert.

01:36:06.428 --> 01:36:09.056
Are you sure
you haven't seen the army?

01:36:09.681 --> 01:36:11.600
No, sir. I haven't seen the army.

01:36:12.434 --> 01:36:13.435
Good.

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:16.855
Pombo, walk with him
to the outskirts of the village.

01:36:17.397 --> 01:36:18.607
Thank you, sir.

01:36:29.576 --> 01:36:31.787
You have
a pebble factory in your shoe.

01:36:31.954 --> 01:36:33.789
It's the second time
you've stopped for the same shit.

01:36:40.462 --> 01:36:43.632
Pacho, that way.
Dario, go over there.

01:36:45.801 --> 01:36:46.969
Willy, go with them.

01:36:50.347 --> 01:36:51.723
- Antonio.
- Cha pa co, let's go.

01:36:51.974 --> 01:36:54.559
Urbano, go over by the fence.

01:36:57.813 --> 01:36:59.564
Arturo, over there.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.775
Keep going, Dario.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.696
Retreat!
Everybody run down the hill!

01:37:09.825 --> 01:37:12.494
L'm covering you!
Downhill, everyone!

01:37:13.036 --> 01:37:15.998
- Chino, what's wrong?
-l lost my glasses!

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.959
They'll kill you. Here they are!

01:37:19.418 --> 01:37:21.586
They killed Coco,julio and Miguel.

01:37:23.088 --> 01:37:25.132
Camba, this way. Camba!

01:37:26.717 --> 01:37:29.594
Camba! What are you doing?

01:37:31.847 --> 01:37:33.015
Come on!

01:37:52.159 --> 01:37:53.493
What happened?

01:37:56.955 --> 01:37:59.166
They killed Miguel,
Julio, and your brother.

01:38:03.879 --> 01:38:05.630
I tried to get them out...

01:38:06.923 --> 01:38:08.425
...but I couldn't.

01:38:15.515 --> 01:38:16.641
L'm sorry.

01:38:33.867 --> 01:38:35.619
This is Che's vanguard.

01:38:36.495 --> 01:38:37.829
You think he's close?

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.041
I think you should bring in the
second Ranger division.

01:38:42.084 --> 01:38:43.919
They haven't finished training.

01:38:45.545 --> 01:38:47.547
You're going to need
every man you can get.

01:39:18.703 --> 01:39:19.704
Benigno.

01:39:21.248 --> 01:39:22.249
Benigno.

01:39:23.834 --> 01:39:27.129
Benigno,
Fernando is asking you to stop.

01:39:31.174 --> 01:39:32.717
Hold on.

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:53.738
Benigno, let me see your wound.

01:39:54.281 --> 01:39:57.075
It's okay. lt's nothing.

01:40:00.996 --> 01:40:02.330
Take it.

01:40:05.292 --> 01:40:06.835
Tell me, Fernando.

01:40:09.004 --> 01:40:11.673
Go with Benigno to explore.

01:40:12.174 --> 01:40:16.887
Let's see if we can find a place
to spend the day without being seen.

01:40:21.266 --> 01:40:23.768
Captain,
a message from Lieutenant Huerta.

01:40:24.019 --> 01:40:26.897
A peasant saw some rebels
heading toward Yuro Ravine.

01:40:28.023 --> 01:40:29.816
Tell him we're on our way.

01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:40.911
Look

01:40:45.999 --> 01:40:48.877
Must be a peasant
on his way to Pucaré.

01:41:53.108 --> 01:41:55.860
- How many are there?
- More than a battalion.

01:41:56.069 --> 01:41:59.364
- Are they together?
- Two or three meters from each other.

01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:02.784
Willy, go look for Nato
and Urbano, immediately.

01:42:03.285 --> 01:42:05.412
Arturo, bring Dario and Aniceto.

01:42:07.289 --> 01:42:11.293
Fernando,
the left ravine ends in a house...

01:42:11.793 --> 01:42:13.169
...that's taken by the army.

01:42:14.296 --> 01:42:17.674
- You can't get out of the middle one.
- This is the steepest ravine.

01:42:18.091 --> 01:42:20.760
It's 500 meters to the hill.

01:42:20.927 --> 01:42:25.307
And there's also a tree I think
would be good as a lookout.

01:42:25.682 --> 01:42:27.267
- Then, go there immediately.
- Okay.

01:42:27.434 --> 01:42:31.980
Benigno, be vigilant, find a place
where we can leave during the night.

01:42:32.397 --> 01:42:33.440
Okay-

01:42:33.815 --> 01:42:34.899
Take care.

01:42:37.152 --> 01:42:39.279
We'll wait there until nine at night.

01:42:40.322 --> 01:42:41.948
Those who don't arrive by then...

01:42:42.157 --> 01:42:45.827
...should make their way down
the ravine to Rio Grande...

01:42:47.162 --> 01:42:50.040
...and from there
to the mouth of Santa Elena.

01:42:50.332 --> 01:42:52.250
We'll wait there for two days.

01:42:54.002 --> 01:42:56.046
Pacho and Willy.

01:42:56.504 --> 01:42:58.840
You will take this position here.

01:42:59.507 --> 01:43:01.009
Antonio...

01:43:02.093 --> 01:43:03.261
...and Arturo...

01:43:04.929 --> 01:43:06.389
...into this ravine.

01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.143
No one shoots until they shoot.

01:43:10.894 --> 01:43:12.270
Ifyou hear gunfire...

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:15.148
...first, find out for sure that
they know about you...

01:43:15.357 --> 01:43:17.525
...and that they're not just
sweeping the area.

01:43:17.901 --> 01:43:20.153
Do you understand? Go now.

01:43:25.575 --> 01:43:28.870
Go with Dario
and reinforce Benignds position.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:32.040
Don't let him
fall asleep from exhaustion.

01:43:38.254 --> 01:43:39.381
Fernando.

01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:44.427
We've been in
worse situations than this.

01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:52.310
There are three ravines:
La Tusca, San Antonio and Yuro.

01:43:53.186 --> 01:43:55.563
The guerrillas
could be in any one of them.

01:43:56.314 --> 01:43:57.482
Search all three.

01:43:58.233 --> 01:44:00.402
Start in the upper canyons
and make your way down.

01:44:00.610 --> 01:44:02.112
What if they try to escape?

01:44:02.862 --> 01:44:05.532
L'll set up a command post
where the three ravines meet.

01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:13.034
<i>Nate.</i>

01:46:15.203 --> 01:46:16.329
Get Aniceto.

01:46:25.171 --> 01:46:28.216
Go with Nato and take over
for Pombo and Urbano.

01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:30.718
Make them both come back.

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:33.596
Wait a moment.

01:47:59.307 --> 01:48:00.642
What's that?

01:48:04.145 --> 01:48:05.647
Hey, Urbano.

01:48:06.439 --> 01:48:08.566
Nato is making
signs I don't understand.

01:48:08.816 --> 01:48:12.320
Either he's saying Fernando wants us
to retreat or move toward him.

01:48:33.591 --> 01:48:36.469
- Antonio, do we move?
- No, we stay here.

01:48:45.687 --> 01:48:48.648
Pablito,
prepare the wounded to leave.

01:48:50.608 --> 01:48:52.151
Go now.

01:49:59.844 --> 01:50:01.929
Fuck! We have to leave now, Urbano.

01:50:02.305 --> 01:50:04.557
Pombo, go now! I can cover you!

01:50:05.308 --> 01:50:06.684
Wait, wait, wait!

01:50:08.519 --> 01:50:10.271
Wait! Now move!

01:50:25.453 --> 01:50:28.456
There they are.
Pombo and Urbano are there.

01:53:02.985 --> 01:53:04.445
How do you feel?

01:53:06.113 --> 01:53:07.615
Fine.

01:53:08.658 --> 01:53:10.743
The lieutenant bandaged it for me.

01:53:14.455 --> 01:53:16.457
Where have you taken Willy and Chino?

01:53:17.458 --> 01:53:18.793
They're next door.

01:53:20.753 --> 01:53:22.797
How many guerrillas are left out there?

01:53:24.090 --> 01:53:25.424
I don't know.

01:53:27.426 --> 01:53:29.178
What was your rendezvous point?

01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:32.056
We didn't have one.

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.850
What's your rendezvous point?

01:53:35.017 --> 01:53:38.145
-L told you we didn't have one.
- You didn't have one?

01:53:39.647 --> 01:53:42.149
Why did you come here
to La Higuera during the day?

01:53:42.483 --> 01:53:44.860
Does it matter?
Nothing matters anymore.

01:53:45.027 --> 01:53:46.487
Listen to me.

01:53:47.738 --> 01:53:49.490
You are no longer in Cuba, sir.

01:53:50.783 --> 01:53:53.869
And you should know that
lam a colonel in the Bolivian army.

01:53:54.787 --> 01:53:58.457
You escaped the Congo, Venezuela,
but I assure you, not Bolivia.

01:53:59.709 --> 01:54:03.587
This is where your adventures end,
you foreign piece of shit.

01:54:04.505 --> 01:54:06.465
Alright. Get some rest.

01:54:06.882 --> 01:54:10.511
Tomorrow we'll go to Vallegrande
to have your wound examined.

01:54:16.809 --> 01:54:18.644
Put on your best face.

01:54:19.687 --> 01:54:21.772
A lot of people
will want a photograph ofyou.

01:54:24.191 --> 01:54:25.985
Maybe we should shave you.

01:54:35.745 --> 01:54:36.996
Piece of shit!

01:54:42.793 --> 01:54:45.546
Bring me the dead,
and leave them here, quickly!

01:55:51.737 --> 01:55:52.905
That's not right.

01:55:53.989 --> 01:55:55.783
They shouldn't do that with the dead.

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:04.750
Do you want to smoke?

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.086
Yes.

01:56:13.592 --> 01:56:14.802
Thanks

01:56:18.806 --> 01:56:20.057
How is Cuba?

01:56:22.768 --> 01:56:24.603
Cuba is progressing.

01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:27.898
Do they have religion there?

01:56:29.775 --> 01:56:32.653
Yes, there are religions.

01:56:33.696 --> 01:56:36.157
I thought Communists
didn't believe in God.

01:56:37.658 --> 01:56:38.742
Well...

01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:41.829
...in Cuba
there's no official religion...

01:56:42.705 --> 01:56:44.165
...but many people believe in God.

01:56:46.458 --> 01:56:47.751
You don't believe in anything?

01:56:48.127 --> 01:56:51.380
Yes, I believe in mankind.

01:56:57.803 --> 01:56:59.930
- Are you married?
- No, no.

01:57:00.764 --> 01:57:03.475
- How about you?
- Yes.

01:57:03.976 --> 01:57:05.519
Do you have children?

01:57:05.686 --> 01:57:07.438
- I have five.
- Five!

01:57:08.981 --> 01:57:10.858
Three girls and two boys.

01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.363
You want some more?

01:57:17.448 --> 01:57:18.449
Yes.

01:57:27.458 --> 01:57:28.584
What's your name?

01:57:28.918 --> 01:57:30.002
Eduardo.

01:57:37.593 --> 01:57:39.011
Would you untie me, Eduardo?

01:58:10.668 --> 01:58:11.794
He)'-

01:58:12.503 --> 01:58:15.005
- Che asked me to free him.
- What?

01:58:15.839 --> 01:58:17.508
He asked me to untie him.

01:58:17.675 --> 01:58:19.760
No, you're crazy.
They'd kill both of us.

01:58:22.763 --> 01:58:24.515
I don't want to go back in.

01:58:24.932 --> 01:58:26.642
You take the next shift.

01:59:09.268 --> 01:59:10.978
What are you thinking about,
Comandante?

01:59:12.813 --> 01:59:14.273
Where are you from?

01:59:14.982 --> 01:59:16.233
From Cuba.

01:59:18.152 --> 01:59:20.029
I don't talk to traitors.

01:59:21.947 --> 01:59:23.824
Okay, so you don't
want to talk to traitors.

01:59:24.783 --> 01:59:26.744
But listen to what I have to say.

01:59:27.786 --> 01:59:29.747
You executed my uncle.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.877
Must be hard, Comandante?

01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:37.171
You, here, in thejungle...

01:59:38.005 --> 01:59:40.883
...and Fidel in Havana
having lunch at El Nacional.

01:59:43.177 --> 01:59:45.012
Can you imagine?

02:00:13.165 --> 02:00:16.877
What made you think the Bolivians
would be receptive to your ideas?

02:00:17.878 --> 02:00:19.963
We already had our revolution.

02:00:20.923 --> 02:00:23.258
Didn't you hear
about the land reform in 1952?

02:00:23.842 --> 02:00:28.347
Yes, and Barrientos sold out.
Now you have a military dictatorship.

02:00:29.223 --> 02:00:31.725
Have you seen how your peasants live?

02:00:32.976 --> 02:00:35.354
If the peasants are so bad off...

02:00:36.063 --> 02:00:37.815
...why did they turn you in?

02:00:38.899 --> 02:00:40.943
Maybe they believed your lies.

02:00:45.114 --> 02:00:47.241
Or maybe, they never wanted you here.

02:00:47.950 --> 02:00:49.868
Yes, maybe...

02:00:51.328 --> 02:00:54.039
...or maybe
our failure will wake them up.

02:01:23.318 --> 02:01:24.111
Captain.

02:01:24.278 --> 02:01:26.196
- Tell me.
- A call for Colonel Zenteno.

02:01:26.405 --> 02:01:30.826
I told them he had left, but they
asked for the senior officer.

02:01:34.079 --> 02:01:35.289
Bravo Uno.

02:01:37.374 --> 02:01:39.168
This is Captain Ramirez.

02:01:41.962 --> 02:01:43.213
Repeat, please.

02:01:45.424 --> 02:01:48.969
Order 600. I will tell the colonel.

02:02:04.943 --> 02:02:06.028
Put him there.

02:02:08.322 --> 02:02:10.991
Take a picture.
You just have to press here.

02:02:15.078 --> 02:02:16.997
So that you can smoke, Comandante.

02:02:20.125 --> 02:02:21.877
Say cheese.

02:02:29.009 --> 02:02:30.052
Stop there.

02:02:37.476 --> 02:02:41.021
I have a message for you from the
high command. They ordered a 600.

02:02:43.190 --> 02:02:45.025
Fine.
I have to leave for Vallegrande.

02:02:45.234 --> 02:02:49.404
L'll send a helicopter back at 1400 hours.
Have the body ready.

02:02:51.198 --> 02:02:52.324
Yes, sir.

02:02:52.991 --> 02:02:54.201
Let's go.

02:02:55.202 --> 02:02:58.497
You can shoot from here down.
Nothing more.

02:02:59.498 --> 02:03:01.291
Listen to me closely.

02:03:02.084 --> 02:03:04.002
I need two volunteers.

02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:11.343
Someone else?

02:03:17.391 --> 02:03:19.351
Sargeant. Let me do it.

02:03:21.395 --> 02:03:23.313
Shoot him below the neck.

02:03:24.523 --> 02:03:25.899
Come.

02:03:39.162 --> 02:03:40.080
Come with me.

02:03:51.425 --> 02:03:52.968
Sit down!

02:03:56.263 --> 02:03:59.182
Shoot. Do it.
