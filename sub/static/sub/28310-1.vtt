WEBVTT

00:05.294 --> 00:09.799
And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:09.832 --> 00:11.267
Time.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.602
Six saltines in under
a minute can't be done.

00:13.635 --> 00:15.037
It's like concrete in here.

00:15.069 --> 00:16.481
That's what they said
about the 2-minute mile.

00:16.505 --> 00:18.374
Nobody's ever run a 2-minute mile.

00:18.407 --> 00:19.471
Watch and learn, chichi.

00:19.496 --> 00:21.878
Okay, and...

00:21.910 --> 00:23.099
go.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.725
Six saltines all at once?
You're smoking crack, dude.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.394
If you want to get
kooky, you could do five

00:27.418 --> 00:28.954
and one or four and two,

00:28.986 --> 00:31.468
but six altogether,
you're just off the grid.

00:31.493 --> 00:34.403
Although I must say, you are
dominating those saltines.

00:34.437 --> 00:37.474
Terry McConky is
bitch-slapping these crackers.

00:37.506 --> 00:38.512
You're gonna do it.

00:38.537 --> 00:40.042
You're gonna...

00:40.075 --> 00:41.744
45 seconds.

00:41.777 --> 00:43.412
Wow! That's amazing.

00:43.445 --> 00:44.673
The saltine challenge is, in fact,

00:44.698 --> 00:46.650
no challenge whatsoever.

00:46.682 --> 00:48.484
- Pay up.
- Okay.

00:48.517 --> 00:50.152
There you go. How do you do it?

00:50.185 --> 00:52.054
I have a wet mouth... super wet.

00:52.087 --> 00:54.378
You know, it's the saliva
that allows you to taste food,

00:54.403 --> 00:56.392
which means food must
taste great to you.

00:56.426 --> 00:57.493
It does. It tastes great.

00:57.526 --> 00:58.929
I really enjoyed my lunch today.

00:58.954 --> 01:00.109
Okay.

01:00.134 --> 01:02.273
I ask this next question
with all due respect.

01:02.298 --> 01:03.454
Which means you don't.

01:03.479 --> 01:05.413
If someone is born with a wetter mouth

01:05.438 --> 01:06.669
than the average person,

01:06.702 --> 01:08.704
does that mean they are
more likely to be plus-size

01:08.738 --> 01:10.340
because food tastes better to them?

01:10.372 --> 01:11.774
Or if you're born plus-size,

01:11.807 --> 01:13.741
maybe you're genetically
born with a wetter mouth,

01:13.766 --> 01:16.880
which makes food tastier,
which keeps you plus-sized.

01:16.913 --> 01:19.624
Hmm. Makes you think.

01:19.649 --> 01:21.627
Yeah, real chicken-or-the-egg
scenario, isn't it?

01:21.651 --> 01:22.719
Yeah.

01:22.752 --> 01:24.854
Tacoma Fire, animal rescue,

01:24.887 --> 01:26.690
6984 Adams Avenue.

01:26.723 --> 01:27.891
Please respond. Let's hit it.

01:31.094 --> 01:32.395
At least it stopped raining.

01:32.428 --> 01:34.464
Holy shit, what is that, a llama?

01:34.497 --> 01:36.600
- An alpaca.
- What's the difference?

01:36.633 --> 01:38.568
A llama is bigger with longer ears,

01:38.601 --> 01:40.637
and alpacas get stuck in swing sets.

01:40.669 --> 01:42.472
- What are you, an expert?
- Google.

01:42.505 --> 01:44.741
The owner said that the
alpaca got stuck up there

01:44.774 --> 01:46.409
and now she can't navigate her way down.

01:46.441 --> 01:47.586
Why don't you just
harness it and lift it out?

01:47.610 --> 01:48.645
We can't. We tried.

01:48.678 --> 01:50.280
Why? 'Cause of the
sharp teeth and claws?

01:50.312 --> 01:51.747
Whoa!

01:51.780 --> 01:55.285
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Blegh!

01:55.318 --> 01:57.487
- Blegh!
- Sneezing on him?

01:57.520 --> 01:58.988
When they're threatened, they spit.

01:59.021 --> 02:00.322
- No kidding.
- Dude.

02:00.363 --> 02:01.635
Ooh.

02:01.660 --> 02:04.893
I think I'm having an
allergic reaction to the spit.

02:04.926 --> 02:06.540
It's actually a gastric goo.

02:06.565 --> 02:08.999
The bigger the threat,
the more they reach down

02:09.031 --> 02:11.300
deep into their tri-part
stomach and just...

02:11.334 --> 02:13.371
It's really gross.

02:13.396 --> 02:14.840
You got a tri-part stomach, right?

02:16.172 --> 02:17.941
Okay, hey.

02:17.973 --> 02:19.476
Now what are you gonna do, huh?

02:19.508 --> 02:21.408
Oh! Oh!

02:21.433 --> 02:23.847
It's like catching gasoline!

02:23.880 --> 02:25.247
Aaah!

02:25.281 --> 02:27.950
God.

02:27.983 --> 02:29.785
Hey, ask Google how to make it stop.

02:29.818 --> 02:32.127
Uh... Love.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.564
That's what I needed to hear.

02:33.589 --> 02:35.895
I need you to come back up
and help distract this thing.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.936
- How am I gonna do that?
- Show your muscles.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.998
Come on.

02:41.023 --> 02:42.224
Hey, pretty girl.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.218
You look so soft.

02:44.243 --> 02:46.312
I just want to pet you all over.

02:46.337 --> 02:48.311
Cap, it's not one of
your divorcÃ©es, okay?

02:48.336 --> 02:50.106
That's not gonna work.

02:50.138 --> 02:51.149
Oh!

02:51.174 --> 02:53.109
Oh! Oh!

02:53.142 --> 02:55.235
Oh!

02:55.260 --> 02:57.529
I got an idea. Ohh!

02:57.554 --> 03:00.057
No, no, Chief, Chief,
you don't want to do that.

03:00.082 --> 03:01.551
Hey, buddy.

03:01.576 --> 03:03.112
You got a lot of spit in your mouth?

03:06.385 --> 03:08.353
Hey. Hey, buddy.

03:08.378 --> 03:12.449
Yeah, I bet that dries
that mouth right up.

03:12.481 --> 03:14.193
All right, Ike, get the
harness. Get the harness.

03:14.217 --> 03:15.452
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

03:15.485 --> 03:17.621
O-kay.

03:20.356 --> 03:21.600
So what we really established

03:21.624 --> 03:23.426
is that your mouth is
wetter than a llama's.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.829
An alpaca, and you owe me 20 bucks.

03:25.861 --> 03:27.798
Collect it from the llama.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:57.494 --> 03:59.562
Check it out. Package
from the alpaca lady.

03:59.596 --> 04:01.485
Ooh, an al-package?

04:01.510 --> 04:04.609
Uh, I can still smell that gastric goo.

04:04.634 --> 04:06.745
As a show of thanks, she is providing us

04:06.770 --> 04:10.374
a $500 gift certificate
for alpaca fleece goods.

04:10.407 --> 04:13.143
Whoa! And they are soft.

04:13.175 --> 04:14.844
Look at that... alpacas.

04:14.878 --> 04:17.981
- Whoo!
- Choice.

04:18.012 --> 04:19.315
Oh-ho.

04:19.349 --> 04:20.651
Soft.

04:20.683 --> 04:22.184
Surprisingly soft.

04:22.217 --> 04:23.554
Oh, soft.

04:23.587 --> 04:25.055
Super soft.

04:25.087 --> 04:27.691
These mamas are soft.

04:27.724 --> 04:29.560
Hey, wait a minute.

04:29.592 --> 04:31.395
Do they kill alpacas for their fur?

04:31.428 --> 04:33.096
Ike, sadly they do.

04:33.128 --> 04:35.431
Disgusting.

04:35.465 --> 04:37.334
Oh, but so soft, though.

04:37.366 --> 04:40.298
They make scarves, mittens,
hats, sweaters, rugs,

04:40.323 --> 04:42.371
- jumpers...
- Ooh, I want a jumper.

04:42.405 --> 04:44.407
I used to have a pair
of alpaca booties once.

04:44.441 --> 04:46.664
- Booties, huh?
- Mm-hmm. I'm a foot guy.

04:46.689 --> 04:48.778
And they really help
with those foot massages.

04:48.811 --> 04:51.247
Ugh, I never let anybody touch my feet,

04:51.280 --> 04:53.282
except for my mom, obviously.

04:53.316 --> 04:55.227
So, what are we gonna do
with the gift certificate?

04:55.251 --> 04:56.620
Are we gonna split it or...?

04:56.652 --> 04:59.065
I'm thinking station
tournament of champions,

04:59.090 --> 05:00.122
winner takes all.

05:00.155 --> 05:01.430
- Whoa!
- Yes.

05:01.455 --> 05:03.936
- We haven't had that in ages.
- That's what I'm saying.

05:03.960 --> 05:07.072
It's raining outside, things
are slow, let's do this.

05:07.097 --> 05:09.516
- Hey, you guys file that alpaca report?
- Already done.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.580
Now we're about to do a
station tournament of champions.

05:11.605 --> 05:12.668
Ooh.

05:12.693 --> 05:14.638
Okay. What's the prize?

05:14.671 --> 05:17.774
We got a $500 gift certificate
for alpaca fleece goods.

05:17.806 --> 05:19.594
Wow. Oh, hey.

05:19.619 --> 05:20.977
This is nice.

05:21.010 --> 05:22.813
Wow, this is really soft.

05:22.845 --> 05:24.320
- I mean, like soft.
- Right?

05:24.345 --> 05:25.414
- Yeah, yeah.
- How do I look?

05:25.448 --> 05:26.616
It looks a little small.

05:26.650 --> 05:27.751
What's the first event?

05:27.784 --> 05:29.653
Frostbite challenge, bitch.

05:29.686 --> 05:32.155
Aw, let's light it up, Sparky.

05:34.491 --> 05:35.959
Yeah, yeah.

05:35.991 --> 05:37.126
Oh, yeah.

05:37.159 --> 05:38.729
- How's that feel, huh?
- You hate this.

05:38.761 --> 05:40.396
You regret this, don't you?

05:40.429 --> 05:41.465
How do you like it?

05:41.498 --> 05:43.667
Nordic Viking power!

05:43.700 --> 05:46.770
Yeah.

05:46.803 --> 05:49.239
Look at Andy, though. He can't take it.

05:49.272 --> 05:52.476
He's soft, like alpaca fur.

05:52.508 --> 05:53.766
There you go.

05:53.791 --> 05:55.289
His little baby arm's
gonna bleed on him.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.414
That's the problem.

05:57.446 --> 05:58.514
- Hey!
- Softie!

05:58.547 --> 06:01.584
He's a softie!

06:01.618 --> 06:03.086
Hey!

06:03.118 --> 06:05.856
No, no, no!

06:05.888 --> 06:07.657
Is this how you spend
the taxpayers' money?

06:07.691 --> 06:09.092
Hey, Councilwoman, how are ya?

06:09.125 --> 06:12.496
- What's all this?
- Uh, this is the frostbite challenge.

06:12.529 --> 06:13.716
Oh!

06:13.741 --> 06:16.003
Oh, is this one of
those, uh, viral things?

06:16.028 --> 06:17.914
I've been watching the
Pittsburgh Police Department

06:17.939 --> 06:19.969
sing the "Hamilton" songs on a loop.

06:20.003 --> 06:23.306
- Good PR.
- No, it's not PR.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.975
- Charity?
- Nope.

06:25.008 --> 06:28.645
It's raining out, so we
were just having some fun.

06:28.678 --> 06:30.714
- Cool.
- Cool.

06:30.746 --> 06:32.023
Can I talk to you in your office?

06:32.047 --> 06:33.849
Uh... now?

06:33.883 --> 06:35.551
Yeah, now, Chief.

06:35.585 --> 06:37.219
You sure?

06:37.253 --> 06:38.688
Really sure.

06:38.722 --> 06:41.091
- So, now?
- Chief, right now.

06:41.116 --> 06:42.325
- All right.
- You got this.

06:42.357 --> 06:43.547
You got this. Don't worry about it.

06:43.572 --> 06:45.628
- Hey!
- Sucka!

06:45.662 --> 06:48.998
Ahhh!

06:49.032 --> 06:50.366
We meet again.

06:58.941 --> 07:00.276
State inspections...

07:03.946 --> 07:05.548
State inspections are next week.

07:05.582 --> 07:06.886
Already, for everybody?

07:06.911 --> 07:09.085
All TFD stations are getting assessed.

07:09.110 --> 07:10.830
The City Council wants
to improve our rating

07:10.854 --> 07:12.537
so that the state increases our budget.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.688
Well, we've always had great ratings.

07:14.713 --> 07:17.850
The council is concerned
they might drop.

07:17.875 --> 07:18.940
Why?

07:18.964 --> 07:22.305
You're a new chief with a track
record for fun and games, which was

07:22.330 --> 07:23.851
just confirmed for me.

07:23.876 --> 07:26.050
That's just a morale
thing... bonding, you know.

07:26.075 --> 07:27.225
It's important for the crew.

07:27.233 --> 07:30.470
I'm all for office playtime
just as much as the next gal.

07:30.502 --> 07:32.024
Thirsty Thursdays?

07:32.049 --> 07:33.139
That's my jam.

07:33.172 --> 07:34.588
But I'll be honest.

07:34.613 --> 07:37.699
There are other members of the council
that didn't want you to be chief

07:37.724 --> 07:39.911
because they didn't
think you were a leader.

07:39.936 --> 07:41.239
Who said that? Was it Tobleson?

07:41.272 --> 07:43.408
You were one of the
guys for a long time.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.176
Now you're the chief.

07:45.209 --> 07:47.245
Act like one, all right?

07:47.277 --> 07:48.979
Focus on the inspection.

07:49.013 --> 07:51.149
No more games.

07:57.688 --> 07:59.190
Ugh, come on.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.964
McConky.

08:05.996 --> 08:07.707
You know, your lips are turning blue.

08:07.731 --> 08:09.501
Your lips are white.

08:09.534 --> 08:11.344
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means.

08:11.368 --> 08:13.671
This arm ain't coming
out until it gets cut off.

08:13.703 --> 08:14.943
All right, hey, hey. Listen up.

08:14.972 --> 08:17.541
We got a big state inspection
next week. We need to focus.

08:17.575 --> 08:19.544
Station tournament of champions is over.

08:19.577 --> 08:21.020
Time to button things up, fellas.

08:21.044 --> 08:23.046
- I'm rooting for ya.
- Okay.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.983
Bye, Miss Price.

08:25.015 --> 08:26.450
- Back on.
- Like Donkey Kong.

08:26.484 --> 08:28.019
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

08:28.051 --> 08:29.525
- What?
- That wasn't all for show?

08:29.550 --> 08:31.739
- No, it wasn't.
- Come on, Juicy Mouth.

08:31.764 --> 08:33.160
- Get back in here. Come on, we'll
- Come on.

08:33.186 --> 08:34.761
throw an extra 15 minutes
on the clock for you.

08:34.787 --> 08:36.351
- Get in here.
- No, we got things to do.

08:36.376 --> 08:38.674
- Like what?
- Like we got to clean and repair the hoses?

08:38.700 --> 08:39.739
We already did that, Chief.

08:39.764 --> 08:41.241
We got to check the
SCBAs and the bottles.

08:41.265 --> 08:42.543
Chief, I already did that this morning.

08:42.567 --> 08:43.572
Get your arms out of the bucket!

08:43.597 --> 08:46.109
Come on, Terry, we've been
here for 45 minutes already!

08:46.134 --> 08:47.173
This is an order.

08:47.198 --> 08:48.347
I want those arms out of the bucket.

08:48.371 --> 08:49.609
I'm gonna count to three.

08:49.634 --> 08:53.243
Three, two, one.

08:53.276 --> 08:56.313
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

08:56.347 --> 09:00.083
Are you kidding me?

09:00.116 --> 09:01.385
Hey, hey, listen up.

09:01.419 --> 09:02.853
- Granny's the winner.
- Oh!

09:02.886 --> 09:05.022
No, you can't make that
call. You can't do that.

09:05.055 --> 09:06.670
I can call it, and I did. I'm the chief.

09:06.695 --> 09:08.168
I'm the commissioner of the tournament.

09:08.192 --> 09:10.472
I want that equipment
inventory on my desk ASAP,

09:10.497 --> 09:11.781
and let's nail this inspection, huh?

09:11.806 --> 09:13.398
Come on, let's go.

09:13.430 --> 09:15.866
- Oh, man.
- Hey, come on now.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.534
Whoa, whoa, Terry, Terry, Terry, Terry.

09:17.568 --> 09:18.870
What did she say to you in there?

09:18.903 --> 09:21.205
She said I should stop being one
of the guys and act like a chief.

09:21.230 --> 09:22.748
You can still be a chief and have fun.

09:22.773 --> 09:23.875
Chief Ratchet was fun.

09:23.908 --> 09:25.342
Chief Bitterman was a lot of fun.

09:25.376 --> 09:26.539
No, neither of them were fun.

09:26.564 --> 09:28.991
Well, then, you can be the first
fun chief. How great is that?

09:29.016 --> 09:30.603
You just want me to be
your playground buddy.

09:30.628 --> 09:32.357
Those days are over. I'm the chief now.

09:32.382 --> 09:34.212
Chiefs don't have fun. I
need you to respect that.

09:34.237 --> 09:35.587
Okay. Okay.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.423
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:38.456 --> 09:40.390
You're welcome, Terry.

09:44.395 --> 09:45.630
Chief?

09:51.068 --> 09:52.904
You will have fun, Terry McConky.

09:52.937 --> 09:55.373
I'll make sure of that. Poor chair.

09:55.405 --> 09:57.775
You got a raw deal in life.

09:57.808 --> 09:59.277
There.

09:59.309 --> 10:00.944
Hope you're hungry, chair.

10:06.983 --> 10:10.087
I thought this chair
smelled bad on the outside.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.686
You guys know how valuable
this alpaca stuff is?

10:22.711 --> 10:24.614
It's like 300 bucks for a sweater.

10:24.639 --> 10:26.996
I could sell this stuff
on eBay and make a killing.

10:27.028 --> 10:28.997
No, not if I win it first.

10:29.031 --> 10:31.130
Yeah, I told my girl
about that alpaca fur,

10:31.155 --> 10:32.701
and she is hot for it.

10:32.734 --> 10:34.503
Mm-hmm. She said she'd do things.

10:34.536 --> 10:36.930
- What kind of things?
- Soft things.

10:36.955 --> 10:37.962
Mm.

10:37.987 --> 10:39.391
See, I can't find anything on here

10:39.416 --> 10:42.078
about them killing
alpacas for their fur.

10:42.111 --> 10:43.966
It just says that they shave them.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.459
Kind of like giving them a haircut.

10:45.484 --> 10:46.499
You know anything about that, Andy?

10:46.524 --> 10:47.847
What would Andy know about haircuts

10:47.872 --> 10:49.053
with his receding hairline?

10:49.078 --> 10:51.744
It's not receding. It's thinning.
There's a difference.

10:51.769 --> 10:53.219
- That's receding, brother.
- Whatever.

10:53.244 --> 10:55.391
When I win, I'm gonna
send all that stuff

10:55.424 --> 10:57.427
back to the alpaca lady in protest

10:57.459 --> 11:00.562
for them killing those beautiful
animals for their fleece.

11:00.595 --> 11:01.697
That's a good cause, man.

11:01.730 --> 11:02.974
You should be proud of yourself.

11:02.998 --> 11:05.300
- Hey, you guys seen Chief?
- He's in his office.

11:05.334 --> 11:06.402
All right, let's do the next event.

11:06.427 --> 11:07.840
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah.

11:07.865 --> 11:09.459
I'm gonna win me some alpaca fur, baby!

11:09.484 --> 11:11.140
No, I'm gonna win that alpaca fur.

11:11.174 --> 11:13.331
That's impossible 'cause I'm
gonna win that alpaca fur.

11:13.356 --> 11:14.758
I'll tell you what my girl said first.

11:14.783 --> 11:16.235
Oh, I already know
'cause she told me, too.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.948
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

11:18.980 --> 11:20.382
Ooh.

11:20.416 --> 11:22.385
Ch-ch-chu.

11:26.988 --> 11:27.990
God.

11:43.439 --> 11:44.974
Oh, God.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.310
Hmm.

12:01.489 --> 12:03.135
Dude, didn't you get
bounced from the military

12:03.159 --> 12:04.930
for having shaky hand syndrome?

12:04.955 --> 12:06.990
Hell no. I was a medic.

12:07.015 --> 12:08.705
You try doing hemorrhoid
surgery on your sergeant

12:08.730 --> 12:10.098
in the middle of a mine field.

12:10.132 --> 12:11.590
It was a piece of cake.

12:11.615 --> 12:13.493
Well, we thank you for your service.

12:13.536 --> 12:14.938
Oh, he's got it.

12:14.970 --> 12:16.004
Oh!

12:16.037 --> 12:17.606
Hey!

12:17.640 --> 12:19.312
Uh, what are you guys doing?

12:19.337 --> 12:21.206
Uh, nothing.

12:21.231 --> 12:23.366
Andy, what are you doing?
No, don't look at him.

12:23.391 --> 12:25.560
Me, look at me, over here.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.282
Andy, over here.

12:27.315 --> 12:29.285
Are you playing Jaws of Life Jenga?

12:29.318 --> 12:30.987
- No.
- It sure looks like it.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.288
No. No.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.570
Then you won't mind if I knock over this

12:33.595 --> 12:34.632
random stack of blocks then.

12:34.656 --> 12:36.191
Is that okay?

12:36.224 --> 12:38.460
- No, no, no.
- Okay, all right.

12:38.493 --> 12:40.662
I said we had to stop
this. We have an inspection.

12:40.695 --> 12:42.009
The inventory is on your desk.

12:42.034 --> 12:43.465
- Hazmat suits?
- Cleaned.

12:43.498 --> 12:44.901
- OSHA checklist?
- Done.

12:44.926 --> 12:47.233
Rescue rope, safety belts,
harnesses, hooks, rope grabs?

12:47.258 --> 12:50.734
Checked, checked, and checked.

12:50.758 --> 12:52.827
Can I talk to you for a second out here?

12:52.860 --> 12:55.263
Not you. Him. Join me.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.965
Clean that up.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.621
I'm supposed to be
putting a stop to this.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.945
No, you're supposed to
be "chiefly," and you are.

13:02.970 --> 13:04.114
You know, you're part of the problem.

13:04.138 --> 13:05.224
You need to follow orders.

13:05.249 --> 13:07.684
I know, but I've been
ragging on you for 25 years.

13:07.709 --> 13:10.304
You're married to my sister.
It's weird taking orders from you.

13:10.329 --> 13:11.822
And stop calling me
Terry in front of the men.

13:11.846 --> 13:13.414
I'm Chief. I'm not Terry.

13:13.447 --> 13:14.915
I'm not Juicy Mouth.

13:14.940 --> 13:16.484
You know what? You're right.

13:16.517 --> 13:18.141
My bad, Chief.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.354
You wouldn't be pulling
any pranks, would you?

13:20.388 --> 13:21.450
What kind of pranks?

13:21.475 --> 13:22.807
Prank pranks, pranky pranks,

13:22.832 --> 13:23.888
covert pranks?

13:23.913 --> 13:25.282
You said now's not the time.

13:25.481 --> 13:26.692
That's never stopped you before.

13:26.717 --> 13:27.724
I don't know what you mean, Chief.

13:27.749 --> 13:28.749
That's right. I'm the chief.

13:28.774 --> 13:29.774
You don't prank the chief.

13:29.790 --> 13:31.962
Are you accusing me of
something specific here?

13:32.367 --> 13:34.503
- No.
- Okay.

13:34.536 --> 13:36.003
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:36.037 --> 13:38.105
- Okay.
- TTYL.

13:38.138 --> 13:39.340
What's that mean?

13:39.373 --> 13:40.642
Talk to you later.

13:40.675 --> 13:42.444
Huh. Okay.

13:55.190 --> 13:57.693
Mm.

13:58.859 --> 14:00.061
Yeah.

14:00.094 --> 14:02.397
Yeah.

14:02.430 --> 14:03.532
Yeah.

14:07.067 --> 14:08.870
Okay.

14:11.672 --> 14:13.174
What the

14:16.176 --> 14:19.413
Aaaaah!

14:25.863 --> 14:27.108
Oh, my God, it's worse.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.139
It's in the wall!

14:28.164 --> 14:29.224
What are you gonna do?

14:29.257 --> 14:30.291
I don't know!

14:30.316 --> 14:31.654
All right, come with me. I
want to show you something.

14:31.679 --> 14:32.995
Come on.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.740
Mmm! My girl just sent me a picture

14:45.773 --> 14:47.408
wrapped in only alpaca fleece,

14:47.441 --> 14:49.512
- and she is fine!
- Let me see.

14:49.537 --> 14:50.742
- No, no.
- Give me the phone.

14:50.767 --> 14:52.146
Maybe I should tell
her about how they kill

14:52.171 --> 14:53.528
those alpacas for their fur.

14:53.553 --> 14:54.592
Maybe I should kill you.

14:54.617 --> 14:55.891
Whoa, whoa, Granny. Granny, calm down.

14:55.916 --> 14:57.118
It's alpaca fleece, right?

14:57.152 --> 14:58.387
- Yeah.
- Okay, then.

14:58.420 --> 15:01.827
Drink.

15:01.852 --> 15:03.065
Mm.

15:04.748 --> 15:05.761
What are you guys doing?

15:05.793 --> 15:06.817
Hydrating.

15:07.929 --> 15:09.239
You're doing the Most Piss Challenge.

15:09.263 --> 15:10.475
I never liked that name.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.109
But I did want to invite
you to come and join us.

15:12.133 --> 15:13.969
I told you no on this. I can't join you.

15:14.002 --> 15:15.535
Terry... Chief.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.400
You are the chiefiest
chief there has ever been.

15:18.425 --> 15:20.471
- Super chiefy.
- We're ready for the inspection.

15:20.496 --> 15:22.059
There have been no calls. It's raining.

15:22.084 --> 15:24.054
You can't go back to your
office because it's destroyed

15:24.079 --> 15:26.183
and it smells like low
tide, and you have won

15:26.208 --> 15:28.222
the Most Piss Challenge every year

15:28.247 --> 15:29.389
for the last 20 years,

15:29.414 --> 15:30.961
and now there's alpaca on the line.

15:30.986 --> 15:32.006
Come on, Chief.

16:04.018 --> 16:05.953
Okay. Okay.

16:05.987 --> 16:07.447
- Captain.
- Okay, Captain.

16:07.472 --> 16:09.208
- Yeah!
- Not a surprise.

16:09.233 --> 16:12.326
Not a surprise. What have we got here?

16:12.359 --> 16:14.376
Oh!

16:14.401 --> 16:16.607
Yeah, I got to lay off the supplements.

16:16.631 --> 16:18.200
That's weird. Okay.

16:18.233 --> 16:19.301
- Man.
- Wow.

16:19.334 --> 16:21.803
Okay. Yeah.

16:21.835 --> 16:23.349
Hey, who's still going? Me.

16:23.374 --> 16:24.806
I'm still going. I'm like a camel.

16:24.839 --> 16:26.474
This is like milking a camel!

16:26.508 --> 16:28.477
Wow. So good.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.920
The best. I told you.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.813
Chief has the most piss!

16:31.845 --> 16:33.381
Chief has the most piss!

16:33.415 --> 16:35.027
Chief has the most piss!

16:35.052 --> 16:36.187
Chief...

16:36.212 --> 16:38.829
It's like I'm spelunking in
an underground cave of urine.

16:38.853 --> 16:41.189
You have got to be kidding me.

16:41.221 --> 16:43.524
I told you to act like a Chief.

16:43.557 --> 16:46.366
I am. I do.

16:46.391 --> 16:48.662
You've...

16:50.029 --> 16:52.666
Chief, I...

16:52.691 --> 16:54.393
Can you...

16:56.370 --> 16:59.140
When I...

17:01.176 --> 17:02.344
Oh!

17:02.377 --> 17:05.239
Good God, how long
has this been going on?

17:05.263 --> 17:06.981
This isn't all me.

17:07.015 --> 17:08.650
Your office looks like a cyclone hit it

17:08.675 --> 17:10.229
and smells like a turtle aquarium.

17:10.253 --> 17:13.539
Then I find you with
your men cheering you on

17:13.564 --> 17:15.020
as you pee for them?

17:15.045 --> 17:16.607
I don't know how to take you seriously.

17:16.632 --> 17:19.126
- I...
- Station 24, all units, rescue call...

17:19.151 --> 17:20.665
child stuck in well.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.829
Okay, let's go. Sorry, I'm sorry, sorry.

17:28.034 --> 17:29.402
Excuse me, folks.

17:29.427 --> 17:31.168
Hunter? It's gonna be okay.

17:31.193 --> 17:32.348
Mommy loves you.

17:32.373 --> 17:34.629
Oh, my Hunter is in the pipe.

17:34.654 --> 17:35.950
He's been down there for hours.

17:35.975 --> 17:37.644
Okay, we'll get him out.

17:40.448 --> 17:42.383
Hunter, can you hear me?

17:42.417 --> 17:44.553
- He's not responding.
- Okay.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.439
- Granny, why don't you get those folks back?
- Got it.

17:46.464 --> 17:48.416
Ike, take Hunter's mom over
to the trucks, would you?

17:48.441 --> 17:50.346
- Come on with me, ma'am.
- He's very fragile.

17:50.371 --> 17:53.245
- All he ate today was oat milk with flaxseed.
- Okay.

17:53.270 --> 17:55.808
His allergist thinks that he
might be protein-prejudiced.

17:55.833 --> 17:56.931
Oh, okay.

17:56.965 --> 17:58.800
Oh, my goodness. Come on.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.402
- Let's go over here.
- We'll get him.

18:00.434 --> 18:01.450
We'll get him.

18:03.571 --> 18:05.740
Looks a little tight
down there for any of us.

18:05.773 --> 18:06.975
Is she gone?

18:07.008 --> 18:09.143
Is my mom gone?

18:09.177 --> 18:10.745
Yes, son, she's in the parking lot!

18:10.777 --> 18:13.192
Good! I'm sick of that a-hole!

18:13.217 --> 18:14.247
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:14.272 --> 18:16.059
All right, let's not
talk about Mom like that.

18:16.084 --> 18:18.787
You ever have to eat flaxseed?!

18:18.819 --> 18:20.221
Hunter, we're here to get you out.

18:20.255 --> 18:21.616
I don't want to come out!

18:21.641 --> 18:24.558
I came down here to bake
and use my iPad to make crap

18:24.592 --> 18:25.960
for my YouTube channel!

18:25.994 --> 18:27.496
You have an iPad down there?

18:27.528 --> 18:28.567
Duh!

18:28.592 --> 18:30.326
How do you think she tracks me?!

18:30.351 --> 18:33.073
All right, listen, Hunter, we're
not leaving here without you,

18:33.098 --> 18:34.569
so we're sending down a rope.

18:34.602 --> 18:36.238
Don't! I'm warning you!

18:36.270 --> 18:37.404
Send it down.

18:37.438 --> 18:38.786
Oh!

18:38.811 --> 18:40.307
Kid, you got a BB gun down there?

18:40.341 --> 18:41.777
Oh, hell yeah!

18:41.802 --> 18:43.515
God, this kid is an asshole.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.655
Here, Andy, you're on rope duty.

18:44.679 --> 18:46.081
Oh, thanks, Captain.

18:46.114 --> 18:48.083
Hunter, stop shooting at my men.

18:48.115 --> 18:49.750
Then leave me alone!

18:49.784 --> 18:51.933
Chief, the water table is
pretty saturated from the rain.

18:51.958 --> 18:53.298
If we don't get this kid out of here,

18:53.323 --> 18:54.823
the water's gonna rise up in this pipe.

18:54.855 --> 18:57.092
All right, Hunter, listen,
if you let us pull you up,

18:57.124 --> 18:58.908
you can vape in the fire truck

18:58.933 --> 19:00.761
and shoot it for your YouTube channel.

19:00.795 --> 19:01.988
Chief, that's irresponsible.

19:02.013 --> 19:03.297
I'm not gonna let him
vape in the fire truck.

19:03.331 --> 19:05.834
- I also want 50 bucks!
- For what?

19:05.866 --> 19:08.487
To buy the Guardians
of Terrary season pass!

19:08.512 --> 19:10.417
- What's that? What's he talking about?
- It's a video game.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.686
For 50 bucks, I can get the elf queen

19:12.711 --> 19:15.009
to take off her royal panties!

19:15.043 --> 19:16.978
Ooh. What kind of video game?

19:17.010 --> 19:18.709
All right, 50 bucks it is.

19:18.734 --> 19:19.883
In advance!

19:19.908 --> 19:21.950
Send it down, douchebag!

19:21.982 --> 19:23.962
- Oh, my God, this kid.
- Okay, anybody got any cash?

19:23.987 --> 19:25.392
- You got cash?
- What, are you kidding me?

19:25.417 --> 19:27.620
- Andy, you got cash?
- Yeah, I got like 25 bucks,

19:27.645 --> 19:29.390
but I was gonna buy my mom a turtleneck.

19:29.423 --> 19:30.491
Okay, come on.

19:30.525 --> 19:33.961
All right, it's coming down.

19:33.995 --> 19:35.556
This is only $25!

19:35.581 --> 19:37.532
Half now, half when you hug your mom.

19:37.565 --> 19:39.050
Fine!

19:39.075 --> 19:40.851
All right, Hunter, we're
sending you this rope down.

19:40.876 --> 19:43.738
- Put it around you.
- Yeah, I get it, dickhead!

19:43.770 --> 19:45.706
- I hate this kid.
- The worst.

19:45.739 --> 19:46.936
There we go.

19:46.961 --> 19:48.142
There we go.

19:48.175 --> 19:49.198
Here he comes. Almost there.

19:49.223 --> 19:50.344
- Easy.
- Easy, easy!

19:50.377 --> 19:51.645
- Easy.
- Here he comes.

19:51.679 --> 19:53.215
Got a big fish here.

19:53.248 --> 19:55.049
There he is.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.851
Hunter, all right, buddy.

19:56.883 --> 19:58.687
Good job, buddy.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.414
Okay, all right.

20:00.439 --> 20:03.091
Going viral, bitches!

20:03.123 --> 20:04.748
Should've asked for 100 bucks.

20:04.773 --> 20:07.503
All right, you get the rest when you
act happy to see your mom, okay?

20:07.528 --> 20:09.176
- Fine.
- All right, Granny, check him out.

20:09.201 --> 20:11.199
Hey, man, show me that elf princess.

20:11.231 --> 20:13.016
How you doing? All right.

20:13.041 --> 20:14.377
Come on. I'm sure he's fine.

20:14.402 --> 20:15.603
He's just a kid. Walk it off.

20:15.628 --> 20:17.213
I'm good.

20:17.238 --> 20:18.666
Since I was doing something

20:18.691 --> 20:20.174
with effort, I was already turtling.

20:20.208 --> 20:21.990
Yes, Lorraine, the city takes pride

20:22.015 --> 20:23.344
in its first responders.

20:23.377 --> 20:25.879
I have no doubt they'll
get the job done.

20:27.715 --> 20:28.782
Back off!

20:28.807 --> 20:30.585
My baby!

20:30.617 --> 20:32.001
Oh!

20:32.026 --> 20:34.339
We are going straight to Wholesome Foods

20:34.364 --> 20:37.434
and you can pick out any
soy pop flavor that you want.

20:39.259 --> 20:40.261
Nice work.

20:40.295 --> 20:42.296
This kind of free publicity is

20:42.329 --> 20:43.597
always a plus.

20:43.631 --> 20:45.867
Are you suggesting we should
put more kids in pipes?

20:45.900 --> 20:48.136
I would never suggest such a thing.

20:48.169 --> 20:49.437
Unless you think it would work.

20:49.469 --> 20:51.401
Excuse me, Chief. Sorry to interrupt.

20:51.426 --> 20:53.775
Just wanted to say tremendous
leadership out there.

20:53.807 --> 20:56.745
Just a pleasure to serve alongside
you every day, and it's an honor.

20:56.777 --> 20:57.824
Thanks, Ike.

20:58.845 --> 21:02.983
Chief, per your request, we are
packing up those trucks ASAP.

21:03.017 --> 21:04.158
Thank you, Andy.

21:04.183 --> 21:07.676
Chief, I know you don't really
consider yourself "one of the guys,"

21:07.701 --> 21:10.286
but the men really respected
your leadership today.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.559
Okay, okay, I get it.

21:11.592 --> 21:13.561
Uh, begging your pardon, Councilwoman?

21:13.594 --> 21:15.630
Saving a kid gets you a lot of goodwill.

21:15.662 --> 21:16.768
Great optics.

21:16.793 --> 21:19.401
So you don't need to kiss the
chief's ass in front of me.

21:19.433 --> 21:21.168
Just doing our jobs, ma'am.

21:21.201 --> 21:22.936
And we will be ready
for that inspection.

21:22.969 --> 21:24.439
Great, great.

21:24.471 --> 21:25.951
Chief, why don't you
talk to the news crew?

21:25.976 --> 21:27.583
I'm sure they'd love to
hear what you have to say.

21:27.607 --> 21:28.943
I'm gonna let you take care of that

21:28.968 --> 21:30.727
'cause you're so good at it.
Thank you, Councilwoman.

21:30.752 --> 21:32.681
Thank you.

21:34.382 --> 21:36.798
All right, now can we finish
the tournament of champions?

21:36.823 --> 21:38.282
No chance. That's an order.

21:38.307 --> 21:40.678
This is just the two of us here.
You know you want to, fun guy.

21:40.703 --> 21:42.472
Look, I'm not the fun
guy until I find out

21:42.497 --> 21:43.751
what happened to my office.

21:43.776 --> 21:45.301
You still wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

21:45.325 --> 21:47.036
I have no idea.

21:47.061 --> 21:48.440
But let me know how that goes, okay?

21:48.465 --> 21:49.702
I'm here to help.

21:54.352 --> 21:56.898
So, uh, we still doing the tourney?

21:56.923 --> 21:58.723
- Hell yeah.
- What's the next event?

21:58.748 --> 22:00.827
Oh, yeah, 'cause I've
got some alpaca fleece

22:00.852 --> 22:03.545
that is ready to sell on eBay, baby.

22:03.577 --> 22:04.815
You know what, guys?

22:04.840 --> 22:06.322
I think we should just
forget about that prize.

22:06.346 --> 22:08.315
No, 'cause I'm still gonna win.

22:08.348 --> 22:10.951
- Yeah.
- There's nothing to win, Granny.

22:10.985 --> 22:12.180
What do you mean?

22:12.205 --> 22:14.559
I talked to the alpaca
lady, and I informed her

22:14.584 --> 22:17.377
that we will no longer be trafficking
in her bloodstained items.

22:17.402 --> 22:18.758
- What?
- You did what?

22:18.783 --> 22:20.795
Wait. Before you freak out,

22:20.820 --> 22:22.696
think about it, okay?

22:22.729 --> 22:24.881
Ike! You're gonna feel a
lot better about yourselves.

22:24.906 --> 22:26.375
Man, we were kidding.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.208
They don't kill the alpacas for their fur.
They just shave them.

22:30.070 --> 22:31.358
- Really?
- Yes.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.141
Yeah. Fur grows back.

22:34.175 --> 22:35.577
Now I'm freaking out.

22:35.609 --> 22:37.353
What am I gonna do when my
girl asks about the fleece?

22:37.377 --> 22:41.148
Guys, I got to make a return.

22:41.182 --> 22:43.752
Come on, beauty.

22:43.784 --> 22:45.152
Okay, so, that's happening.

22:45.185 --> 22:47.688
Wow. That's... Oh, boy.

22:47.722 --> 22:49.991
I found it! I found it!

22:50.023 --> 22:51.248
Oh.

22:51.273 --> 22:53.103
You put it in the chair,
you son of a bitch.

22:53.127 --> 22:57.165
Yeah, well, I just wanted
you to have some fun.

22:57.197 --> 22:59.593
I'll get a new chair now.
I solved the mystery.

22:59.618 --> 23:01.212
I solved it. No help from you.

23:01.237 --> 23:03.003
Okay, well, fun is fun, Chief.

23:03.037 --> 23:04.506
You're never gonna get me again.

23:04.539 --> 23:06.423
- Never!
- You say that to me.

23:06.448 --> 23:08.577
- I will get you again.
- Good job.

23:14.749 --> 23:16.251
Ahh.

23:21.455 --> 23:22.590
Shit!

23:22.624 --> 23:23.893
Eddie!

23:24.853 --> 23:25.971
Eddie!

23:26.067 --> 23:27.068
Chiefy?

23:27.820 --> 23:29.004
I give up.

23:29.749 --> 23:31.183
- Uncle.
- Uncle?

23:31.208 --> 23:32.343
Yeah.

23:32.368 --> 23:33.368
Curtain rod.

23:35.154 --> 23:37.638
- Oh, you sneaky bastard.
- Mm-hmm.

23:43.110 --> 23:44.176
Fun, right?

23:45.360 --> 23:46.970
You come see me if you
want to have more fun.

23:46.995 --> 23:48.049
You're not fun.

23:48.081 --> 23:49.312
Come on outside if you
want to have fun with me.

23:49.337 --> 23:50.597
Just come where the fun is, okay?

23:50.622 --> 23:51.720
Fun.

23:51.752 --> 23:53.221
Get out of here!

23:53.253 --> 23:55.903
- Fun!
- No!

23:55.661 --> 23:58.456
This season on Tacoma FD...

23:58.493 --> 24:00.402
Oh, wait a minute, is
Lucy the new probie?

24:00.424 --> 24:02.030
I just want you to think
of me as one of the guys.

24:02.052 --> 24:04.093
- See you in the showers.
- Not if I see you first.

24:04.115 --> 24:05.706
What?

24:08.117 --> 24:10.954
- Fall back, McConky.
- I'm the fire chief.

24:11.359 --> 24:13.333
- Chief says we can retaliate.
- Yeah!

24:13.363 --> 24:17.489
- You guys are awesome!
- I'm here, because you guys are sloppy.

24:17.908 --> 24:20.325
You fed your 5-alarm
chili to a pregnant woman?

24:20.355 --> 24:22.550
Hey, it's good chili. Oh, no! My chili!

24:22.587 --> 24:24.296
- There will be no more farting.
- That's all I do!

24:24.318 --> 24:26.101
- No more swearing.
- Oh [BLEEP]!

24:26.108 --> 24:28.760
- There'll be no hazing.
- Let me down! Let me down!

24:28.782 --> 24:31.361
Prepare yourselves,
it's about to get crazy.
