WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
(bird cawing)

00:07.808 --> 00:10.078
(brakes squealing)

00:18.219 --> 00:20.388
(distant sirens wailing)

00:22.390 --> 00:24.792
Oh, come on. Come on.

00:24.825 --> 00:27.027
(motorcycle engine revving)
Come on.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.035
(distant sirens wailing)

00:39.140 --> 00:41.342
(panting)

00:45.513 --> 00:47.248
Oh.

00:47.281 --> 00:50.084
(sirens wailing)

00:56.690 --> 00:58.426
Cutting it a little close, bro.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.528
You trying to get us
busted or something?

01:01.529 --> 01:03.431
(gunshots)

01:06.167 --> 01:08.336
*

01:38.366 --> 01:40.668
(typing)

01:40.701 --> 01:41.802
Oh.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.204
Okay.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.772
So your fingers aren't broken.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.707
What, now?

01:46.740 --> 01:49.443
Oh, just figured that was
the reason you haven't RSVP'd

01:49.477 --> 01:51.279
to my e-vite.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.881
For my painting party?

01:53.914 --> 01:56.317
Oh, I thought that was a joke.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.551
I'm sorry,
what's a painting party?

01:57.585 --> 01:59.553
It is like a
housewarming party,

01:59.587 --> 02:01.222
except instead of
standing around,

02:01.255 --> 02:04.158
you just, you get to get
your hands dirty.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.260
That sounds more like free labor
than a party.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.429
Come on. Painting is fun.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.632
Unless someone is posing nude,
I am not interested.

02:11.665 --> 02:14.235
Mm, fine. But you do not know
what you're missing.

02:14.268 --> 02:17.438
Look, if this is just a ploy
to see me with my shirt off,

02:17.471 --> 02:19.240
I can make that happen
right now.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.909
You have quite the imagination.

02:21.942 --> 02:25.313
The offer still stands. You say
the word, I'll lose my shirt.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.181
And the job, Torres.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.617
Gear up. Got a dead
Marine in Maryland.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.253
McGee and Quinn?
They're already on the way.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.321
TORRES:
Hey, Gibbs.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.257
Did you get Bishop's e-vite?

02:36.290 --> 02:38.459
The hell's an e-vite?
(scoffs)

02:39.927 --> 02:41.629
(camera shutter clicking)

02:41.662 --> 02:43.397
(siren chirps)

02:43.431 --> 02:45.899
QUINN: Well, my mom always said,
"If you're not careful,

02:45.933 --> 02:47.935
you'll end up face down
in the mud somewhere."

02:47.968 --> 02:50.304
Always thought
that was a figure of speech.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.739
Tell that to him.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.940
What do we know?

02:52.973 --> 02:54.408
Well, the victim
is Marine Corporal

02:54.442 --> 02:58.312
Kyle Campbell, he is
a cargo clerk stationed

02:58.346 --> 03:00.748
onboard the USS Saipan

03:00.781 --> 03:01.882
out of Norfolk.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.352
A hitchhiker called 911,

03:04.385 --> 03:05.886
and reported the body.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.688
Hitchhiker give you anything?

03:07.721 --> 03:08.756
Not really.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.258
Apparently, he spotted the body

03:10.291 --> 03:11.725
when he was walking past.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.261
All yours, Duck.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.828
Thank you, Timothy.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.232
Come, Dr. Palmer, let's free
this young man from the mud.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.234
All right.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.302
Here we go.

03:21.335 --> 03:24.738
One, two, three.
(grunts)

03:24.772 --> 03:26.674
(shutter clicking)

03:26.707 --> 03:29.910
There you are, Corporal,
your final about-face.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.680
My apologies
for moving you.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.416
JIMMY: This body's
been moved before, Doctor.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.885
There's a blood trail,
leads back to the road.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.254
His killer probably dragged him
back here,

03:40.288 --> 03:41.689
keep him out of sight.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.990
So it would seem.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.459
You looking for new a job,
Palmer?

03:45.493 --> 03:46.594
(chuckles)

03:46.627 --> 03:47.961
TORRES:
Hey, Gibbs.

03:47.995 --> 03:48.996
I got something.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.033
What do you got?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.768
Two set of tracks, fresh ones.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.307
Motorcycle?

03:59.340 --> 04:00.574
A dirt bike.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.777
You sure about that?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.613
Oh, yeah.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.481
There's a larger one.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.384
Maybe a small truck.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.989
Explains why the smaller tracks
stop here.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.292
Loaded onto a truck.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.395
Gibbs, local LEO
said there was a bank robbery

04:21.429 --> 04:23.030
a few miles north
of here, yesterday.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.366
Perp made his getaway
on a dirt bike.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.336
Security footage?
It's on its way to Abby now.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.037
Hey, Gibbs?

04:30.070 --> 04:32.039
I'm gonna need
to take a look at that.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.342
You know something we don't?

04:35.576 --> 04:37.511
Just a hunch.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.348
ABBY: This is Boonsboro Savings
and Loan yesterday morning,

04:40.381 --> 04:42.416
just moments before
the robbery kicks off.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.085
You know, legendary bank robber
Ralphie "Slick" Sommers,

04:45.118 --> 04:46.720
he called this lull...

04:46.754 --> 04:49.022
The calm before the storm.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.724
Can we just skip
to the good part?

04:50.758 --> 04:51.992
Patience, Nick.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.395
Okay...

04:54.428 --> 04:55.429
Showtime.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.769
He only wanted bills
from the front of the drawer.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.471
Ah, he's avoiding dye packs.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.506
He knows the system.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.575
GIBBS: He ever show his face?
Nope.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.109
But using the height
of the counter,

05:09.142 --> 05:10.511
I was able to do

05:10.544 --> 05:12.112
a size comparison, and clocked

05:12.145 --> 05:14.615
our bank robber in at six foot,
four inches tall.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.916
Well, that rules out
Corporal Campbell.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.818
He's not even six feet.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.654
Wait, hold on a second.
Can we go back?

05:20.688 --> 05:22.322
The dirt bike.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.792
Can you zoom in on that?

05:24.825 --> 05:25.993
You have a make and model?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.995
I can't zoom in,
it'll distort

05:28.028 --> 05:29.463
the pixelation even more.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.598
I'm afraid this
is as good as gets.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.966
It's a Suzuki RM125,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.369
2002, yellow, with
a red racing stripe,

05:35.403 --> 05:37.137
and a custom exhaust.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.773
You got that from
a blurry video?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.442
There's no way.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.678
How do you know so much
about a bank robber's dirt bike?

05:44.712 --> 05:47.114
'Cause that is not
his dirt bike.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.082
It's mine.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.530
McGEE:
I didn't know you were
in a rap group, Torres.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.764
Make a dope album cover.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.832
(laughs softly)

06:04.865 --> 06:07.535
Meet the Rosewood
Boyz. 2012,

06:07.568 --> 06:09.603
they were a rising crew
mostly known for, uh,

06:09.637 --> 06:11.505
riding dirt bikes,

06:11.539 --> 06:12.506
partying hard,

06:12.540 --> 06:13.206
robbing banks.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.643
Sounds like a well-rounded day.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.445
NCIS asked me to go deep cover.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.780
I became Nick Medina,

06:19.813 --> 06:22.516
a full-fledged Rosewood Boy.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.517
Why NCIS?

06:23.551 --> 06:25.118
Well, they had
a habit for, uh,

06:25.152 --> 06:27.921
recruiting sailors and Marines
to do their dirty work.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.457
How long was the op?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.159
Little over a year, took
us to, uh, to get our guy.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.828
Mitch Monroe, the top dog.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.197
Kept his men in the shadows,
no loose ends.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.132
But I found one.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.102
Royce Layton. Real good kid.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.705
Just mixed up
with some bad dudes.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.540
We got real tight.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.776
When I saw bodies piling up,
and I took my shot,

06:48.809 --> 06:51.445
I blew my cover, and I asked him
to flip on his boss.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.980
He did the right thing.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.915
He did the courageous thing.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.884
By ratting on Monroe?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.218
By testifying.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.453
Because of him,

06:59.487 --> 07:01.555
Mitch Monroe got 20 to life.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.757
He was taken care of
by the Feds.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.459
Witness protection.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.127
Sounds like Royce knows
the gang inside and out.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.862
Let's talk to him.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.464
Easier said than done.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.799
GIBBS: If he's
federally protected,

07:11.832 --> 07:12.900
he's unlisted.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.201
Maybe untouchable.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.503
Even to us?

07:15.536 --> 07:16.770
Especially to us.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.606
Royce's still a marked man.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.641
Nothing brings
more heat than, uh,

07:20.674 --> 07:22.476
agents knocking
on your door.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.777
You think Corporal Campbell's
really the kind of Marine

07:23.811 --> 07:25.579
to get involved
with the Rosewood Boyz?

07:25.613 --> 07:27.915
All right, well, I just got
off the phone with his O.I.C.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.517
I'm gonna go see what she knows.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.918
All right, keep at it,
keep digging.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.120
I want everything
on Corporal Campbell.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.956
McGee, contact
the Department of Justice.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.791
I want to talk to Royce Layton.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.926
Let's go, Bishop.

07:38.959 --> 07:39.927
You're with me.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.596
Where to?
Prison.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.931
Hey, Gibbs, don't you think
I should go with you guys?

07:43.964 --> 07:44.965
I mean, I know Monroe.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.001
Advantage him, not us.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.938
Yeah, but I lived and breathed
the Rosewoods for over a year.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.506
I mean, I can,
I can be an asset.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.508
Go find a lead on your old bike.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.043
Well, can I at least

07:56.076 --> 07:57.978
brief you
on Mitch Monroe?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.547
Call you from the car, Torres.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.884
(elevator bell dings)

08:07.955 --> 08:09.723
JIMMY:
Dr. Mallard?

08:09.757 --> 08:12.259
Can you come look at something
for a second?

08:12.292 --> 08:14.828
What have you found,
Dr. Palmer?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.296
I'm not sure.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.198
Could be, uh, mud.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.834
Maybe, but not exactly.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.269
Ah, that's quite an analysis.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.904
Thank you.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.539
In a vast number of cases,

08:25.573 --> 08:29.309
identifying a mysterious
substance like this one,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.579
is best determined

08:31.612 --> 08:34.281
by searching
for specific markers,

08:34.314 --> 08:36.650
which in this case...

08:37.718 --> 08:40.253
...are not there.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.691
Why don't you take this
up to the lab?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.930
(buzzer sounds)

08:51.098 --> 08:52.900
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:55.168 --> 08:56.604
BISHOP:
Thanks.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.773
Mitch Monroe?

08:59.807 --> 09:01.609
Appreciate you
sitting down with us.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.311
It's not like I had
to clear my schedule, hon.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.948
You play chess, Monroe?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.850
Only against myself.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.953
We're working a homicide.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.657
Bank was robbed in Boonsboro,
guy fled on a dirt bike.

09:16.690 --> 09:20.694
We think that he killed
his accomplice, a Marine.

09:20.728 --> 09:24.131
There's reason to believe
it was gang related.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.066
Rosewood Boyz.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.568
You saying the boys
are up and running again?

09:29.703 --> 09:31.672
(laughs)

09:31.705 --> 09:33.206
And you think
I'm running it from in here.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.075
Well, that's been done before.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.745
To be honest,
by the time I got locked up,

09:37.778 --> 09:39.179
I didn't have many friends left.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.380
A bunch of 'em got killed.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.583
Yeah, mostly by you.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.754
Those sick rumors
still floating around?

09:46.787 --> 09:48.355
You can think what you want,

09:48.388 --> 09:51.391
but I'm telling you the truth,
straight up.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.727
I didn't kill my homies.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.329
Sure you did, straight up.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.667
The names Colin Day,
Jamel Jackson,

09:59.700 --> 10:02.069
Mickey Miller ring any bells?

10:02.102 --> 10:06.774
They were just chess pieces
you needed to sacrifice, right?

10:06.807 --> 10:09.710
Colin and Jamel got rolled on by
a couple of crosstown cowards,

10:09.743 --> 10:13.246
and Mickey got silly drunk,
and drowned in a pool.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.715
Yeah, well,
those are the stories.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.717
But we know the truth.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.285
You trying to bring
more charges on me?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.253
'Cause I'm up for parole
in five years.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.790
Then I would start talking.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.425
I might've heard some rumors

10:25.458 --> 10:27.661
that someone
was rallying the troops,

10:27.695 --> 10:29.229
trying to get back in business.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.231
You got a name?
Nope.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.767
And the boys will make damn sure
that you don't get one either.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.436
Real Rosewoods don't talk.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.138
Ever.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.107
Mm. Then how'd
you end up in here?

10:40.140 --> 10:43.210
You're NCIS.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.878
Know that Fed that
put me in here?

10:44.912 --> 10:46.780
Called himself Nick Medina?

10:46.814 --> 10:49.416
Give him a
message for me.

10:49.449 --> 10:53.253
I'm not gonna be
in here forever.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.891
(knocking on door)
Come in.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.730
Thank you for seeing me,
Director.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.698
Make it quick, Torres.
I will.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.734
The Marine who was
killed yesterday,

11:06.767 --> 11:09.469
seems like he was tied
to a gang I worked on,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.338
five years ago, undercover.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.908
I should not be forced
to sit on the sidelines.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.711
I took down their leader and
gave a year of my life to do it.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.880
And you were paid for your time.

11:19.913 --> 11:23.016
You did your job
then, do it now.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.985
Agent Gibbs made
the personnel choice

11:25.018 --> 11:26.219
he felt best
served our goal

11:26.253 --> 11:28.288
of solving
this investigation.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.428
And that's me.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.397
I'm wasted sitting on the bench.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.736
You ever heard
the name Jack Haley?

11:42.770 --> 11:43.771
No.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.405
NBA journeyman.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.074
'96 Bulls.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.243
Rode the bench
most of his career.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.780
But he was the one person
that the team's star forward,

11:52.813 --> 11:56.850
Dennis Rodman, trusted
the most, opened up to,

11:56.884 --> 11:58.819
often leaned on.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.854
What is your point, sir?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.924
Haley made the biggest
impact of his career

12:03.957 --> 12:05.826
from a seat on the bench.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.495
And the only thing stopping
you from doing the same

12:08.528 --> 12:10.330
is you.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.999
(soft chuckle)

12:12.032 --> 12:14.167
With all due respect, sir,

12:14.201 --> 12:17.204
I didn't give eight years
of my life to deep cover

12:17.237 --> 12:18.906
to be a Jack Haley.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.474
Your move, Torres.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.545
I'm going home.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.881
Come on,
it's not worth

12:27.915 --> 12:29.149
throwing away your career.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.551
No, I'm going home
to get my old notes.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.987
Early in the op,

12:34.021 --> 12:36.123
we were partying,
I caught a little buzz,

12:36.156 --> 12:38.859
I almost took my shirt off
and jumped in the pool.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.527
I was wearing a wire.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.963
Not good.
No, not good.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.032
Ever since that day,
I never wore a wire again.

12:45.065 --> 12:50.237
I wrote notes on every hour,
every day on a little planner.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.040
That little planner is
stashed away deep in my closet.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.342
Then you need to go home.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.081
(door closes)
Enjoyed the talk, Torres.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.282
(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:02.315 --> 13:03.951
WOMAN:
I was about to report

13:03.984 --> 13:05.986
Campbell U.A. again
when I got your call.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.321
"Again?" Why, has
it been a problem?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.589
It has been lately.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.058
Oh?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.960
Corporal Campbell was quiet,

13:12.993 --> 13:14.862
well-liked,
a good Marine.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.563
But the last few months,
he seemed to change.

13:16.596 --> 13:17.998
He was distracted.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.867
Had to write him up
a couple times.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.969
Any idea what was wrong?

13:22.602 --> 13:24.004
I suspected drugs.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.940
But we just did a random
sweep, and he was clean.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.275
Was there anyone he was
particularly close to

13:28.308 --> 13:29.509
on the ship?

13:29.542 --> 13:30.978
No, not lately.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.480
He seemed withdrawn.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.616
He had a girlfriend,
but I heard they broke up.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.118
I can get her name.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.552
Maybe she knows
what his problem was.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.857
(dog barking in distance)

14:15.923 --> 14:18.091
*

14:25.999 --> 14:28.035
(explosion)

14:28.068 --> 14:30.971
(grunts)

14:32.105 --> 14:33.340
(panting)

14:41.681 --> 14:44.251
What you got, Abbs?
ABBY:
Oh.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.988
Your old chariot,
or what's left of it.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.690
Yeah, the universe has
a cruel sense of humor.
Hmm.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.093
Hey, Nick.
Yeah?

14:53.126 --> 14:55.262
It works out better
for everybody

14:55.295 --> 14:57.330
if you just go ahead
and give me the Caf-POW!

14:57.364 --> 14:58.365
before it becomes a problem.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.368
Oh, yeah.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.103
When exactly does it
become a problem?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.372
As soon as I have to ask.
Got it.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.241
Oh, it's really hard
to see her like this.
Yeah.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.510
I mean, if it helps,
your baby didn't feel a thing.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.246
She was packed with
so much black powder,

15:13.280 --> 15:15.715
it could've blown up a rhino.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.219
I mean, thankfully,
it did not blow up a rhino.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.388
How nice
that I'm still alive, too.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.190
Oh, no, yeah.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.258
Oh, it totally sucks
that you almost got killed.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.494
But, you know, rhinos are on
the endangered species list.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.429
Okay, I get it,
you love rhinos.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.531
Moving on. Detonator.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.501
So the bad guys
used a jerry-rigged

15:34.534 --> 15:37.070
cell phone as a detonator.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.271
Prepaid burner, untraceable?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.273
That word is blasphemous

15:40.307 --> 15:42.075
in the house of Sciuto.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.977
Like John Paul Jones said...

15:44.011 --> 15:45.545
Ramble on.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.347
No, no, the other
John Paul Jones.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.616
"I have not yet begun to fight."

15:49.649 --> 15:51.584
I don't doubt it.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.453
Seriously, Nick,
you got to promise me

15:53.486 --> 15:55.522
you're gonna be careful
around these dudes.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.457
You're lucky to be alive.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.527
Abby, luck has a funny way of
evaporating when you need it.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.362
If the bomb was
meant to kill me,

16:02.395 --> 16:03.997
it would have.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.298
They wanted me alive.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.467
Why?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.169
Well, that's what I intend
to find out.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.444
BISHOP: You took all
your case notes in that?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.147
I logged every conversation,
every person I met.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.614
Wow, it seems more dangerous
carrying that around

16:21.648 --> 16:23.316
than wearing a wire.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.518
Well, at least I was able
to show the goods.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.719
(both chuckle)

16:26.753 --> 16:29.389
Wow, must've been

16:29.422 --> 16:32.092
so hard for you
being undercover.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.726
You know,
sometimes it was so hard.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.496
You find anything actually
useful in there?

16:36.529 --> 16:37.397
Not yet.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.566
Well...

16:39.599 --> 16:41.501
we need to find a connection

16:41.534 --> 16:43.336
between Campbell
and the Rosewoods.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.372
You want a connection
between Campbell and that gang?

16:45.405 --> 16:47.107
Look in the
mirror, Torres.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.409
Me?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.311
How?
The same guys

16:51.344 --> 16:54.347
that killed Campbell just
tried to blow your ass up. Why?

16:54.381 --> 16:55.748
BISHOP: Revenge, I assume.
I mean, they've probably been

16:55.782 --> 16:57.450
looking for Nick all this time.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.553
No, if it was a revenge hit,
I'd be dead.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.289
BISHOP: The explosion
must have something to do

17:02.322 --> 17:04.324
with Campbell, I mean, the
timing can't be a coincidence.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.459
Where are the Rosewood Boyz
hanging out?

17:06.493 --> 17:08.328
QUINN:
I may have a lead on that.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.497
Turns out Campbell
had an ex-girlfriend,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.432
and I managed to
track down her address.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.034
You want us to
pick her up?
Oh, she's on her way in.

17:17.770 --> 17:21.341
Guys like Kyle don't come
around too often these days.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.776
Yeah, tell us about him.

17:23.810 --> 17:29.116
The Kyle I choose to
remember was... generous.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.650
He had a kindness.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.586
But he also had no filter.

17:33.620 --> 17:38.057
The Kyle you choose to remember
seems like a pretty good guy.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.060
What about the other Kyle?

17:43.530 --> 17:48.568
Um... about six months ago,
he started to change.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.471
He'd become obsessed with
fantasy baseball, of all things.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.440
Gambling.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.707
Losing.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.509
Big time.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.379
He went into debt pretty bad.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.583
We were just... fighting
about it nonstop, and...

18:03.616 --> 18:05.285
and then, suddenly,

18:05.318 --> 18:07.320
Kyle just started
paying off his debt.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.589
Where'd he get the money?
He wouldn't tell me.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.225
Not at first, but I knew
it had something to do

18:12.259 --> 18:15.128
with his new friends.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.529
New friends have a name?

18:16.563 --> 18:19.899
(scoffs) Fools called themselves
the Rosewood Boyz,

18:19.932 --> 18:22.169
that's the only name
that I ever knew.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.603
I confronted Kyle.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.906
He said he just needed to make
a little bit more money

18:26.939 --> 18:30.177
and then he'd make
a clean break.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.446
I just... I didn't believe him.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.582
Why not?

18:35.615 --> 18:36.816
He was still gambling.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.485
Then one day
his friends

18:38.518 --> 18:41.288
gave him a second cell phone,
to use only with them.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.423
Kyle said that
they were paranoid

18:43.456 --> 18:46.526
about keeping
their identities secret.

18:46.559 --> 18:50.697
So, when they called Kyle to
meet, do you know where he'd go?

18:50.730 --> 18:53.200
He wouldn't tell me.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.601
So, I...

18:54.634 --> 18:55.668
um...

18:55.702 --> 18:57.804
"Um," what?

18:57.837 --> 19:00.440
I put a GPS tracker on his car.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.277
I thought that
he was cheating on me.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.346
Hey, nobody's judging you.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.647
I am.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.916
Well done.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.818
So, did you find out
where he was going?

19:11.851 --> 19:14.754
Uh, Miller's Motocross.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.557
It's a pretty popular track.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.159
*

19:39.246 --> 19:41.714
You know, I wasn't sure
what I was expecting,

19:41.748 --> 19:43.250
but it definitely
wasn't this.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.651
Wow.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.587
QUINN:
Welcome to motocross, McGee!

19:47.620 --> 19:49.389
This is fun stuff.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.624
This is not fun, this is every
mother's worst nightmare.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.636
Them.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.704
Over there.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.773
McGEE:
You sure?

20:08.608 --> 20:09.742
He's sure.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.979
Nice run.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.782
Looking a little choppy
before you hit the triple.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.584
Yeah, I spun out
on a dime.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.752
I thought for sure we were
gonna end up stacking bodies.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.622
Yeah, me too. You really need
a guardrail, something padded.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.292
And there's only one thing
that I dislike more

20:25.325 --> 20:26.526
than catching a bad batch

20:26.559 --> 20:27.927
and losing my wheels--

20:27.960 --> 20:29.496
being hassled by cops.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.332
NCIS.
Oh.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.633
Ask you a few
questions about

20:33.666 --> 20:35.602
the death of
Corporal Kyle Campbell?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.771
And I need a little pillow talk
with Kate Upton.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.006
QUINN: Look, you
knew Kyle, right?

20:40.039 --> 20:41.674
If you have
nothing to hide,

20:41.708 --> 20:43.910
then there's nothing
to be quiet over.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.614
Oh, okay, yeah, I-I guess
I'll talk to you guys, then.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.682
(laughs)

20:49.716 --> 20:51.384
Nice dime-store
interrogation tactic.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.753
Where'd you pick it up,
"Mind Games for Morons"?

20:55.488 --> 20:56.756
It's a nice bike.
(clears throat)

20:56.789 --> 20:57.857
What are you doing, buddy?

20:59.726 --> 21:01.561
It's probably best you stop
touching on the bike.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.063
Or what?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.299
Better start showing
me some respect.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.501
I would hate to
see you get hurt.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.339
Hey, hey, drop it!

21:13.773 --> 21:16.476
He wants to touch your bike...
let him touch.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.378
He's screwing with me.
No.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.946
He's playing you.

21:19.979 --> 21:20.913
He's good at that.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.483
At least we know
who's running the show now.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.886
Thanks for the look.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.755
Been thinking about
buying a bike myself.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.791
And? What's the verdict?

21:31.824 --> 21:33.860
I'm gonna stick with a sedan.

21:33.893 --> 21:37.096
Gets good gas mileage, not too
flashy, and you know what?

21:37.129 --> 21:40.400
It is comfy.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.502
Quinn, take a picture.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.805
Smile.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.974
Thanks.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.543
Onward and upward, boys.
Let's go.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.714
Boss, how'd you even know
that was the Rosewood Boyz?

21:54.747 --> 21:56.649
The bike tipped me off.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.885
How'd you know which bike?

21:58.918 --> 22:01.754
The one with the big rose
painted on the side.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.561
He look familiar, Torres?

22:08.595 --> 22:11.731
No. Are you sure this Alonzo
guy's the one calling the shots?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.533
Yeah.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.702
That's a hell of a mountain
to climb in only five years.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.737
You sure he wasn't
in the gang back then?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.606
Maybe he was so low level,

22:19.639 --> 22:21.508
he wasn't even on your radar.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.742
Not likely.

22:22.775 --> 22:23.776
What about your guy

22:23.810 --> 22:25.612
who was put in the Witness
Protection Program?

22:25.645 --> 22:26.846
Royce Layton?
I have no idea where he is.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.415
What about him?

22:28.448 --> 22:31.017
Might know something
about this Alonzo guy.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.753
Boss, just spoke
with the DOJ.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.088
They want approval
from the Marshals Service

22:36.122 --> 22:37.990
before they'll release
Layton's whereabouts.
GIBBS:
Get it.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.726
I've been working on it,

22:39.759 --> 22:41.027
but the Marshals Service
won't give their approval

22:41.060 --> 22:42.729
until DOJ signs off on it.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.531
Okay, we focus on Alonzo.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.765
Need something to turn
the screws. Bishop?

22:45.798 --> 22:48.134
Checking his credit card
and bank records

22:48.167 --> 22:50.837
to see if I can connect him
to any large deposits.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.605
Quinn.

22:52.639 --> 22:53.873
I'm gonna check
his cell phone records.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.007
Maybe I can place him
in Boonsboro

22:55.041 --> 22:56.643
the day Corporal Campbell
was killed.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.911
I'm gonna take another whack
at the Justice Department.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.848
Torres, maybe you can check...
Where is he?

23:08.555 --> 23:10.557
(birds squawking)

23:38.818 --> 23:40.487
(chuckles)

23:40.520 --> 23:42.121
What up, Royce?

23:42.154 --> 23:44.156
Witness protection
looks good on you.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.505
Hey, man, I like what you
done to the place.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.608
You said you'd check in on
me every few weeks, Nick,

24:01.641 --> 24:05.211
and five years
later, here we are.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.879
(chuckles)

24:06.913 --> 24:08.781
Hey, man, the Feds said
it was dangerous for me

24:08.815 --> 24:10.550
to be coming
around too often.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.552
Right, right, the Feds.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.187
You were safe, though, Royce.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.758
You know, I trusted you
like a brother and...

24:18.791 --> 24:20.560
here's where it got me.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.495
Well, it beats the hell
out of a Cellblock "E."

24:22.529 --> 24:24.096
(laughs)

24:24.130 --> 24:25.765
You think?
(laughs)

24:25.798 --> 24:28.067
Ah, this place...

24:28.100 --> 24:30.603
this place is its own kind
of cellblock, believe me.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.805
Well, you had yourself
a nice run with the Rosewoods

24:32.839 --> 24:36.242
until you smartened up
and you testified.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.511
Nah, destroying
people's lives isn't smart.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.179
Take down Monroe
we had to take down

24:40.212 --> 24:42.982
a bunch of friends with him.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.952
Friends... who were criminals.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.520
Ah, see, see, see?

24:47.554 --> 24:49.656
Friends to you.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.225
Family to me.

24:53.259 --> 24:56.028
Come on, man.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.835
What you spinning out here, man?

25:02.869 --> 25:04.537
Potter's wheel.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.205
Artista top.

25:06.238 --> 25:09.609
Helps me forget
what I've become.

25:09.642 --> 25:10.843
And what's that?

25:10.877 --> 25:12.579
A rat.
(chatters)

25:12.612 --> 25:16.015
The kind of rat can't
make peace with what I did,

25:16.048 --> 25:19.318
what I did... for you.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.821
Well, I guess it's a bad
time to ask you for a favor.

25:21.854 --> 25:22.922
(chuckles)

25:22.955 --> 25:25.224
Ah, so you got jokes, huh?

25:25.257 --> 25:26.859
Not jokes, man.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.628
The Rosewoods are running again.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.597
I have a dead Marine.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.565
We have a suspect,
but it's thin.

25:32.599 --> 25:35.067
I was hoping you could
help us with some intel.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.272
Alonzo?

25:40.306 --> 25:44.176
(chuckles) Man, he's harmless,
small-time hustler.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.678
No, man, he's the new boss.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.647
Since you knew him
better than I did...

25:47.680 --> 25:49.749
You want me to rat again.

25:49.782 --> 25:53.119
I prefer to call it help.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.955
Funny, I do bad things,
I end up here.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.290
You do bad things
and you still get to play cop.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.992
I did what I had to do.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.794
And if NCIS knew what that was,

26:01.828 --> 26:04.664
what would they
think of you then?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.001
Are you gonna
help me out or what?

26:09.035 --> 26:12.872
Lucky I'm a better friend to you
than you ever were to me.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.375
Alonzo, he's been...

26:16.408 --> 26:19.011
he's been keeping a secret
for a long time.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.848
Come on.
Come on.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.794
We're happy
to see you, too, Abby.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.796
BISHOP: Ah, so this
is what it'll be like

26:36.829 --> 26:39.866
when Abby finally gets a wax
figure at Madame Tussauds.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.233
What do you got?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.268
Don't you want to know

26:42.301 --> 26:43.269
why I'm smiling like this first?

26:43.302 --> 26:44.236
Yes.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.373
The smile train hit me
head-on in the face

26:47.406 --> 26:50.242
for the same reason
we are gathered here.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.678
Less than an hour ago,

26:51.711 --> 26:54.080
I raised my forensics game

26:54.113 --> 26:55.748
into the stratosphere

26:55.782 --> 26:57.917
or the Sciuto-Sphere.
QUINN:
Isn't that the phone

26:57.950 --> 27:00.419
that was used to detonate
the bomb on Torres' bike?

27:00.452 --> 27:02.221
We already knew
about that, Abb.

27:02.254 --> 27:05.758
But what we never stopped and
asked ourselves is what happened

27:05.792 --> 27:07.259
to the phone

27:07.293 --> 27:09.128
that called the phone

27:09.161 --> 27:10.429
that made the bike go boom.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.699
See, even Gibbs is smiling,

27:12.732 --> 27:14.767
and he's gonna smile more
when he sees this.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.337
Burn phone as detonator.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.773
Cash purchase two days ago.

27:20.807 --> 27:23.776
Metro found it in a Dumpster
after I traced its whereabouts.

27:23.810 --> 27:24.744
Where was that?

27:24.777 --> 27:28.414
Whoever called did so from...

27:28.447 --> 27:32.284
the 400 block of Sherman Road
in Greenbelt.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.986
Alonzo's last
registered address.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.688
493 Sherman Road.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.257
I'll call Torres.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.359
NCIS!

27:42.028 --> 27:43.162
TORRES:
Hey, Gibbs.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.431
The helmet our Marine killer
wore at the bank robbery.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.766
BISHOP:
Yeah, our man's here.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.969
TORRES:
Alonzo, come out!

28:06.318 --> 28:07.787
They're dead.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.021
They?

28:09.055 --> 28:11.423
Yeah, it looks like
Alonzo had a secret.

28:12.792 --> 28:13.926
Double tap.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.194
Rosewood Boyz.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.763
Question is, which one?

28:16.796 --> 28:18.297
Why?

28:23.135 --> 28:25.137
(phone ringing)

28:33.279 --> 28:34.513
Torres.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.783
DISTORTED VOICE:
Alonzo Marcel ordered the hit

28:36.816 --> 28:39.986
on Corporal Campbell, and now
he's a gift from me to you.

28:40.019 --> 28:43.222
Your investigation ends here.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.457
You have your killer;
now walk away,

28:45.491 --> 28:47.493
or NCIS will find out

28:47.526 --> 28:50.729
what you've been hiding
all this time.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.404
It's sad when they
come in so young.
It is indeed,

28:58.437 --> 29:01.140
but then you and I both
know that all of life

29:01.173 --> 29:02.508
is a near-death experience.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.911
We must never cease
to give thanks

29:04.944 --> 29:06.145
for the gift of today.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.213
Isn't that right, Jethro?

29:07.246 --> 29:08.781
I'll tell you tomorrow.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.549
DUCKY:
Well, if one is an incident

29:10.582 --> 29:12.418
and two is a coincidence,

29:12.451 --> 29:15.054
then three is most
certainly a pattern.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.522
Like our Marine,

29:16.555 --> 29:19.358
these two died of double tap.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.027
Same technique,

29:21.060 --> 29:22.528
bigger weapon.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.931
DUCKY: Yeah, well, these
head wounds tell me

29:24.964 --> 29:26.265
that a higher-caliber weapon

29:26.298 --> 29:28.034
was used here

29:28.067 --> 29:29.836
than the one that killed
Corporal Campbell.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.271
Well, different gun doesn't
mean different shooter.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.040
There any evidence
of a struggle?

29:34.073 --> 29:36.542
Mm, quite the opposite.

29:36.575 --> 29:38.544
The position they were
found in indicates

29:38.577 --> 29:40.913
inactivity at the time of death.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.181
Sleeping.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.415
DUCKY:
Yes, Jethro.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.184
They were ambushed.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.253
JIMMY:
Oh, just one more thing.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.587
Remember the mysterious
substance we found

29:48.620 --> 29:49.655
under the fingernails
of Corporal Campbell?

29:49.688 --> 29:51.824
Yeah, Abby's compared every mud
in North America.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.192
Nothing matched.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.962
Yeah, except for the remarkably
similar substance

29:55.995 --> 29:58.264
we found
on Alonzo Marcel's boots.

29:58.297 --> 30:01.300
If they are
one in the same,

30:01.333 --> 30:04.536
then that would directly connect
the two attacks.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.272
It's a whole lot of ifs, Ducky.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.235
Why you hit the-the
emergency button?

30:36.268 --> 30:39.271
Because I can.

30:39.305 --> 30:42.641
We don't have an
emergency, Gibbs.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.978
Or do we?

30:46.012 --> 30:47.246
Tell me.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.249
Tell you what?

30:50.282 --> 30:52.919
What you're hiding.

30:55.922 --> 31:00.092
Okay. Let's talk.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.661
Where to start?

31:02.694 --> 31:05.164
The truth.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.935
What if I'm not sure
I know it anymore?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.970
We find it.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.039
I can't help unless
you help yourself.

31:13.072 --> 31:17.576
Time to tear off that Band-Aid.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.648
I planted evidence.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.252
I planted evidence

31:26.285 --> 31:29.521
to get Monroe off the streets
so no other people,

31:29.555 --> 31:33.692
especially my friends,
would get murdered.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.995
Gang members.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.564
What they do,
not who they are.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.932
Any regrets?

31:39.966 --> 31:42.034
Zero. No regrets.

31:42.068 --> 31:45.972
That Rosewood investigation
swallowed me up whole.

31:46.005 --> 31:50.042
And when another two
Rosewoods got smoked...

31:50.076 --> 31:53.045
I swiped the pistol
he used to do it

31:53.079 --> 31:56.048
and I tossed it in the bushes
next to the victims.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.050
His victims?
Yes.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.718
You're sure?
Absolutely.

31:59.751 --> 32:03.622
He looked me in the eye and
said, "I killed them both."

32:03.655 --> 32:06.125
And that was just
the tip of the spear.

32:06.158 --> 32:10.229
Gibbs, he was
cleaning house.

32:12.231 --> 32:16.468
I had no choice.
I had to do it.

32:16.502 --> 32:19.071
I was hoping this is
the part where you'd say,

32:19.105 --> 32:21.073
"Hey, Torres, your
job is secure.

32:21.107 --> 32:24.476
When I was a young
NIS agent, uh..."

32:24.510 --> 32:25.711
(clears throat)

32:25.744 --> 32:28.180
(imitating Gibbs):
"I did the same thing."

32:30.449 --> 32:33.252
Torres,

32:33.285 --> 32:35.554
we got a lot more
in common than you think.

32:38.124 --> 32:41.593
But my Band-Aids,
they always stay on.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.630
Abby. Mud. Go.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.965
Don't come back
without an answer.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.607
Hey, Torres.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.643
Hey.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.411
Hey, Abbs.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.413
Please tell me
this is mud.

33:01.447 --> 33:04.083
Uh, most of it.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.751
Disgusting.
Well, that was

33:05.784 --> 33:08.420
the hand that I was dealt
and I played the hell out of it.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.122
I mean, this is
totally, like,

33:10.156 --> 33:12.524
a straight royal flush.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.760
That's not actually
a thing, is it?

33:14.793 --> 33:15.927
Analogy still worked.

33:15.961 --> 33:19.131
So, what are you saying, Abby?
You identified the mud?

33:19.165 --> 33:21.767
I shipped in samples
of every variation

33:21.800 --> 33:23.535
and every strain of mud

33:23.569 --> 33:25.704
that I could get my filthy
little hands on.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.140
And just when I thought
I couldn't keep trudging,

33:28.174 --> 33:29.475
the major mass spec

33:29.508 --> 33:31.810
got a match...
(typing)

33:31.843 --> 33:33.212
...and made
beautiful music.

33:34.413 --> 33:35.347
Kaolin mud?

33:35.381 --> 33:36.782
Actually, it's clay.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.151
Clay?
Like pottery clay?
Yeah.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.453
It's like the
Rolls-Royce of mud.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.555
Huh. So, how'd
the same pottery clay

33:43.589 --> 33:45.524
end up on two
of the three victims?

33:45.557 --> 33:47.426
You got any theories,
Torres?

33:50.262 --> 33:53.099
He just bail
on us again?

34:00.506 --> 34:04.310
Royce, I know it was you.

34:04.343 --> 34:08.080
Don't do something
we're both going to regret.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.282
What do you want?

34:18.457 --> 34:20.459
(wind chime tinkles softly)

34:28.500 --> 34:30.536
(screen door creaks open)

34:34.806 --> 34:36.708
Were you expecting anyone else?

34:38.477 --> 34:42.181
If I'm not the only friend
you're blackmailing today,

34:42.214 --> 34:43.815
well, I'd like to know that.

34:43.849 --> 34:46.218
Wouldn't call it blackmail.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.787
Think of it as restitution.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.789
I don't owe you anything.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.224
Then why are you
standing there

34:52.258 --> 34:54.193
holding that bag full of cash?

34:54.226 --> 34:57.563
Is all 200
of it there?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.665
It's all here.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.167
Good.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.403
How did you know Alonzo
had 200 K in his safe?

35:04.436 --> 35:07.139
Because he was
holding it for me.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.675
He was a good earner,
useful, but...

35:09.708 --> 35:12.744
then he got greedy
and the envelopes were lighter.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.213
So you had him killed?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.714
He was not content

35:15.747 --> 35:18.317
with the Rosewoods'
current leadership.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.186
And that'd be you.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.222
You can't take
what somebody else earns.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.924
I've had to teach
a lot of people that.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.660
Now, how the hell did you
run the Rosewood Boyz

35:28.694 --> 35:30.562
from witness protection?

35:30.596 --> 35:33.332
Monroe was feared,
hated, so,

35:33.365 --> 35:35.601
when we put him away,
I wasn't seen as a snitch.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.869
No, I was a savior,
so I capitalized.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.905
Made all the right promises
to all the right people,

35:39.938 --> 35:42.874
and made sure to get rid of
all the wrong ones.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.943
Like Corporal Campbell.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.346
Why'd you have him killed?

35:47.379 --> 35:49.915
Ah, kid made
a couple of scores for us,

35:49.948 --> 35:52.451
but he was a degenerate gambler,
a liability.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.486
Do I really need to explain
how all this works?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.422
I mean,
not to be an impolite host,

35:56.455 --> 35:59.191
but I think it's about time we
both got what we came here for.

35:59.225 --> 36:02.794
So, please,
put the bag on the table.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.663
I need to check it.

36:13.505 --> 36:17.776
All right, now your turn.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.612
Where's this audio
you claim you have on me?

36:20.646 --> 36:22.948
Do you remember that night
you came back to the crib

36:22.981 --> 36:25.551
and told me how you
planted Monroe's gun?

36:25.584 --> 36:27.653
You recorded our conversation?

36:29.721 --> 36:31.823
On this drive is an audio file.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.593
200 Gs in exchange
for your freedom.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.263
Not a bad deal.

36:37.296 --> 36:40.299
How do I know it's the only one?

36:40.332 --> 36:42.401
You don't.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.243
(zipper opens)

36:51.277 --> 36:54.613
Ah...
(laughs)

36:56.615 --> 36:58.884
And here I was worried you were
gonna try something stupid.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.720
(clicks tongue, laughs)

37:01.753 --> 37:03.289
Hey, Royce.

37:03.322 --> 37:04.790
Hmm?

37:04.823 --> 37:07.526
There's something else
in there for you.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.403
You son of a bitch.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.938
Go ahead and try 'em on.
I think they're your size.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.640
(handcuffs clink on table)
And what do you think

37:21.673 --> 37:23.509
will happen
when I give this to the Feds?

37:23.542 --> 37:26.044
I have no idea, but why don't
you ask them yourself?

37:26.077 --> 37:29.381
They're right outside.
Go ahead, say hi.

37:36.021 --> 37:38.690
You're out of moves, Royce.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.967
Turn around.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.604
Royce... please turn around.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.080
(grunts)

38:05.951 --> 38:06.952
(bike engine revs)

38:19.898 --> 38:20.899
(engine revs)

38:35.113 --> 38:36.948
(tires skidding on gravel)

39:07.012 --> 39:08.614
QUINN:
Torres! Geez!

39:16.054 --> 39:19.057
(engines revving)

39:42.714 --> 39:44.916
(engine revs)

40:14.179 --> 40:15.213
Ah!

40:15.246 --> 40:16.081
(groans)

40:17.849 --> 40:19.117
Hey, Royce!

40:19.150 --> 40:20.151
(grunts)

40:22.988 --> 40:25.491
You forgot these.

40:45.744 --> 40:48.046
Breathe, Nick. Breathe.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.247
I just listened

40:49.280 --> 40:53.184
to the audio file that Royce
tried to blackmail you with.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.653
I didn't understand a word.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.188
Nothing but a lot
of mumbling.

40:57.222 --> 41:00.191
No way to know
that it's even you.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.861
Wait, so he was bluffing?

41:05.797 --> 41:08.867
Why would he even think that
I would give him 200 K

41:08.900 --> 41:11.236
without even listening
to the audio file first?

41:18.276 --> 41:22.581
So, uh, Abby said
she was sure, right?

41:22.614 --> 41:24.816
I mean, she scanned through
the whole entire file

41:24.850 --> 41:26.518
and said I was good to go?

41:26.552 --> 41:28.587
No. Not Abby.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.021
Me.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.159
By yourself?

41:34.192 --> 41:35.927
(papers shuffling)

41:35.961 --> 41:37.162
I mean, you know
how to scan

41:37.195 --> 41:40.165
for audio files
on an external hard drive?

41:40.198 --> 41:44.235
You did the wrong thing
for the right reasons.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.173
Never do that again.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.809
(papers tap on desk)

41:50.842 --> 41:54.145
Been a long week, Torres.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.648
Late.
(taps keyboard)

41:56.682 --> 41:58.083
Go home.

42:12.698 --> 42:14.700
