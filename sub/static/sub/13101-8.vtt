WEBVTT

00:02.167 --> 00:05.250
[instrumental music]

00:14.042 --> 00:16.375
Figured I'd find you here.

00:16.458 --> 00:18.750
Feels strange to have
the place this empty.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.708
It's the war room.
The war's over.

00:21.792 --> 00:23.542
Yeah, says you.

00:23.625 --> 00:24.917
Oh, yeah, the Shadows are gone

00:25.000 --> 00:27.708
but, uh, with all
that's going on back home

00:27.792 --> 00:30.958
maybe there's some life
in the old girl yet.

00:31.042 --> 00:32.583
Any more ships
come in from Earth?

00:32.667 --> 00:35.250
Just a couple of scavengers, no
loyalties to anyone back home.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.750
Alien traffic
is the same as ever.

00:37.833 --> 00:39.708
But as far as Earth goes,
this quarantine's got us

00:39.792 --> 00:41.083
pretty much shut down.

00:41.167 --> 00:44.000
- Mm, this is trouble.
- Definitely trouble.

00:44.083 --> 00:46.125
With the commercial transport
fees, we were finally starting

00:46.208 --> 00:47.833
to get our heads above water.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.625
Now without that revenue,
it's gonna be tough.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.792
Yeah, we'll get by.
We always have.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.333
This place has been declared
dead more times than Lazarus

00:55.417 --> 00:56.583
but we keep coming back.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.833
Yes, we do.

00:58.917 --> 01:01.042
So what's got you so worried?

01:03.625 --> 01:05.292
I'm not worried.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.417
Tell that to your face.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.917
Come on, John,
I've known you too long

01:09.000 --> 01:11.125
to start playing stupid now.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.875
Right before we broke
away from Earth last year

01:16.958 --> 01:19.667
I talked to my dad.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.708
I couldn't say much..

01:22.792 --> 01:25.833
...but he could see
what was coming.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.750
Since then we've passed
a few messages back and forth

01:28.833 --> 01:31.792
on ships en route
here or back home.

01:31.875 --> 01:34.917
His last letter mentioned
something about some strangers

01:35.000 --> 01:36.833
hanging around town
asking questions

01:36.917 --> 01:39.625
about me, the family, the farm.

01:39.708 --> 01:40.708
Do you think
President Clark would use

01:40.792 --> 01:42.250
your family to get to you?

01:42.333 --> 01:43.667
It's possible.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.167
I told them to get out
while they could.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.458
I gave them some names.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.167
And then we get hit
with this damned embargo

01:49.250 --> 01:51.125
and I don't know what
the hell is going on back home.

01:51.208 --> 01:53.000
You told me about your dad.
He's a smart guy.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.875
He can take care of himself.

01:54.958 --> 01:56.125
And being a former diplomat

01:56.208 --> 01:58.417
he's too visible
to just disappear.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.250
Yeah, maybe.

02:01.625 --> 02:04.958
[sighs]
I just hope
they get out in time.

02:08.292 --> 02:09.875
Everything else okay topside?

02:09.958 --> 02:11.583
(Ivanova)
'So far.'

02:11.667 --> 02:13.083
Some businessmen
from Earth are upset

02:13.167 --> 02:15.167
because they can't go home
now without being questioned

02:15.250 --> 02:17.917
and searched,
but we can handle it.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.875
Some problems in customs,
but Zack's on it.

02:20.958 --> 02:23.042
You know, the more that I think
about it, the more I'm glad

02:23.125 --> 02:26.417
that we picked him to take over
security when Garibaldi left.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.792
We haven't had
a major incident yet.

02:29.875 --> 02:32.708
Come on! Whoa, whoa!
Everybody back!

02:32.792 --> 02:35.292
Everybody back, back!

02:35.375 --> 02:37.250
What the hell's
going on here, Ramirez?

02:37.333 --> 02:40.208
Scanners turned up something
suspicious in those crates, sir.

02:40.292 --> 02:42.792
We went to take a look,
and they got in our way.

02:42.875 --> 02:45.542
- 'Explosives?'
- 'The scanners say no.'

02:45.625 --> 02:48.292
Could be weapons,
contrabands, dust.

02:48.375 --> 02:49.833
Well, then, let's open them up.

02:49.917 --> 02:52.542
Hey, that's private property.
We've got rights here.

02:52.625 --> 02:55.583
What you're gonna have is
my foot 16 inches up your butt

02:55.667 --> 02:57.958
if you don't get
the hell out of my way.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.792
[grunts]

03:10.167 --> 03:11.292
You're crazy!

03:11.375 --> 03:12.292
I'm gonna file a report

03:12.375 --> 03:13.375
with your superior officer.

03:13.458 --> 03:14.750
Well, you do that, sunshine.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.292
Ramirez, check the box.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.250
Yes, sir. Good shot, chief.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.000
Well, don't say that

03:20.083 --> 03:22.458
until you know
what I was aiming at.

03:26.917 --> 03:30.000
[intense music]

03:33.875 --> 03:36.500
What the..

03:36.583 --> 03:38.833
It's a camera.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.958
That's right, a camera.

03:41.042 --> 03:42.375
It goes with the territory.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.917
I'm a reporter,
and this is my crew.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.417
And you just made
the evening news.

03:56.417 --> 03:59.125
[instrumental music]

03:59.208 --> 04:01.042
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.917
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.917
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.625
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.958
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.792
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.333
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.125
(Mollari)
It was a new age.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.000
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.083
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:22.417 --> 04:26.417
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261, the place..

04:26.500 --> 04:28.792
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.917
[theme music]

05:01.458 --> 05:04.500
[music continues]

05:25.125 --> 05:28.042
[instrumental music]

05:43.375 --> 05:45.667
Captain, I was just
on my way to see you.

05:45.750 --> 05:46.917
I'm gonna pull some
of the other doctors off

05:47.000 --> 05:48.542
standby duty in Medlabs 3 and 4.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.583
- And I wanted you to know.
- Why?

05:50.667 --> 05:52.375
Well, we've got some
problems with the telepaths

05:52.458 --> 05:54.292
locked up in cryogenic freeze.

05:54.375 --> 05:55.708
- Anything serious?
- No.

05:55.792 --> 05:57.333
Just some mechanical
problems with the freezer.

05:57.417 --> 06:00.000
So we're moving half of them
to another freezer bank.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.458
We're not set up to handle
this many

06:01.542 --> 06:03.667
so we've had to improvise,
and they require

06:03.750 --> 06:06.083
constant supervision
during the changeover.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.750
Then take what you need.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.208
I hope you
can help them, Stephen.

06:09.292 --> 06:10.958
I hate to keep them
frozen like this.

06:11.042 --> 06:12.542
I don't think
we have much choice.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.792
With all that leftover Shadow
technology still in their heads

06:14.875 --> 06:17.958
they're a menace to themselves
and to other people.

06:18.042 --> 06:20.292
We'll figure it out eventually.

06:20.375 --> 06:24.042
You know, y-you fight a war
and everyone forgets the people

06:24.125 --> 06:25.875
that get caught in the middle.

06:25.958 --> 06:28.042
Something tells me we'll be
dealing with this legacy

06:28.125 --> 06:31.125
the Shadows left behind
for a long, long time.

06:31.208 --> 06:32.667
[beeps]

06:32.750 --> 06:35.333
- Yes.
- 'Captain, he's here.'

06:37.042 --> 06:38.875
On my way.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.458
I thought we saw the worst of it

06:41.542 --> 06:44.542
with the Shadows,
the Vorlons, the war.

06:45.708 --> 06:48.625
There's something
far worse than the Shadows..

06:49.667 --> 06:51.833
...reporters.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.000
Captain Sheridan,
Dan Randall, ISN News.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.833
Thank goodness,
someone reasonable to talk to.

06:59.917 --> 07:02.958
Oh, thank you.
He's such a sweet talker.

07:03.042 --> 07:05.667
She threatened to grab
me by the collar

07:05.750 --> 07:07.250
and throw me out an airlock
if I didn't turn over

07:07.333 --> 07:08.917
a full manifest
of our equipment.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.042
Unauthorized shipments are
a threat to station security.

07:11.125 --> 07:13.375
- We had to--
- Commander!

07:13.458 --> 07:15.417
Did you threaten
to grab ahold of this man

07:15.500 --> 07:18.208
by the collar
and throw him out an airlock?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.667
Yes, I did.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.542
I'm shocked.
Shocked and dismayed.

07:23.625 --> 07:26.542
I'd remind you that
we are short on supplies here.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.500
We can't afford to take
perfectly good clothing

07:28.583 --> 07:29.875
and throw it out into space.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.833
Always take
the jacket off first.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.167
I've told you that before.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.708
Sorry, she meant to say,
"Stripped naked

07:36.792 --> 07:38.333
and thrown out an airlock."

07:38.417 --> 07:41.542
I apologize for any confusion
this may have caused.

07:50.750 --> 07:54.375
Maybe I should start again.

07:54.458 --> 07:57.458
- That would be wise.
- Yes, very.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.833
[sighs]

08:02.667 --> 08:05.042
We changed the manifest
because we knew if you found out

08:05.125 --> 08:08.417
we were a news crew, you
wouldn't let us on the station.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.667
Well, that assumption
was your first mistake.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.667
- We have an open-door policy.
- And an open airlock policy.

08:13.750 --> 08:16.250
- Commander.
- Sorry.

08:16.333 --> 08:20.625
President Clark put the embargo
around Babylon 5, we didn't.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.417
- Then you would have let us on.
- You, yes. Your equipment, no.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.292
(Sheridan)
'Mr. Randall..'

08:27.625 --> 08:29.792
...everyone knows that
ISN is a propaganda arm

08:29.875 --> 08:31.625
for President Clark.

08:31.708 --> 08:34.458
You didn't come here
to do an objective story.

08:34.542 --> 08:36.458
There's no such thing.

08:36.542 --> 08:38.667
The objective journalist
is one of those great myths

08:38.750 --> 08:41.333
you read about,
like a griffin or a phoenix

08:41.417 --> 08:42.917
or an honest politician.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.917
Everybody's got an agenda
whether they admit it or not.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.333
But you try not to let it
get in the way of the truth.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.250
Look, I won't lie to you.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.375
You're absolutely right about
ISN, which is why most of us

08:56.458 --> 08:59.250
quit as soon as Clark took over.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.000
But a few of us stayed on

09:01.083 --> 09:02.667
figuring we could try to

09:02.750 --> 09:05.583
slip the truth in quietly
and in small bites

09:05.667 --> 09:07.792
while the big boys
weren't looking.

09:07.875 --> 09:11.875
That's exactly why I fought
to get this assignment.

09:11.958 --> 09:14.042
So you could tell
the whole truth?

09:14.125 --> 09:17.458
No, not the whole truth.

09:17.542 --> 09:21.083
Just as much as I can
without getting into trouble.

09:21.167 --> 09:24.292
But even a little truth
is better than none.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.625
Captain, we're here now

09:30.708 --> 09:34.500
and one way or another
we have to go back with a story.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.333
If you work with us

09:36.417 --> 09:39.542
we can try to get your side
of things across to the viewers.

09:39.625 --> 09:43.250
W-we'll have to be careful,
but it can be done.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.208
If you don't,
we'll do the story anyway.

09:46.292 --> 09:50.792
And there'll be nobody
to represent your point of view.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.500
Now, is that really
what you want?

09:53.583 --> 09:56.667
[instrumental music]

09:59.917 --> 10:02.750
This particular statue
means a great deal

10:02.833 --> 10:04.333
to me and my family.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.542
We lost it
when we were evacuated

10:06.625 --> 10:08.500
from the Eridian Colony.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.208
It must have
great sentimental value, huh?

10:10.292 --> 10:13.250
Oh, substantial, heh. Yeah.

10:13.333 --> 10:16.333
W-while we were gone,
the scavenger fleet

10:16.417 --> 10:20.000
got past our sensors
and ransacked the entire colony.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.417
Oy, it's a terrible thing, yeah.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.917
I-it belonged to my dear
departed wife Leticia.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.500
A good woman,
but, uh, a shouter.

10:29.583 --> 10:32.208
Yeah, the universe
is a quieter place without her.

10:32.292 --> 10:34.833
You'll forgive me for saying so.

10:34.917 --> 10:37.458
It's been in my family
for generations.

10:37.542 --> 10:40.667
Mr. Garibaldi, please,
can you help me?

10:40.750 --> 10:43.250
This statue, no, uh,
intrinsic value?

10:43.333 --> 10:46.208
- Oh, no, no, none whatsoever.
- I see.

10:47.417 --> 10:49.708
Ask me if I believe in God.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.042
Oh, go on, go on, ask me.

10:51.125 --> 10:54.875
- I-I don't understand.
- No, no, no, come on.

10:54.958 --> 10:58.542
Alright, heh, do you believe
in God, Mr. Garibaldi?

10:58.625 --> 11:00.417
No, and you want to know why?

11:00.500 --> 11:02.542
Because if there were a God,
then maybe just once in my life

11:02.625 --> 11:04.250
somebody would sit in that chair

11:04.333 --> 11:05.875
and not assume
that I'm an idiot.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.042
This is a Drazi statue.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.083
It's Shokalla,
one of the minor deities.

11:09.167 --> 11:11.083
You said the Maker.

11:12.417 --> 11:14.917
S-so, so my
grandfather converted.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.250
We stuck with it.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.792
So, uh, so,
what are families for, right?

11:18.875 --> 11:20.875
So we believe
in the Maker, so what?

11:20.958 --> 11:22.958
We still have our culture,
our language.

11:23.042 --> 11:24.417
I don't care
what you believe in.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.792
The point is,
aside from the Centauri

11:25.875 --> 11:27.667
all of the other Maker
religions are monotheistic.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.542
They don't allow
the keeping of alien Gods.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.417
Something about
eternal damnation. Plague, pox.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.583
The usual,
not the kind of things

11:32.667 --> 11:34.833
that you wanna pass
on to your kids.

11:34.917 --> 11:39.250
Look, Mr. Garibaldi, I-I have
no reason t-to tell you--

11:39.333 --> 11:42.250
I'm not finished!
Now, you're right.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.792
The statue itself is worthless

11:43.875 --> 11:46.125
but it's big enough
to hide lots of stuff inside.

11:46.208 --> 11:48.417
Now, my guess is,
when the evacuation began

11:48.500 --> 11:50.167
you grabbed as many
valuables as you could

11:50.250 --> 11:51.458
and you hid the rest.

11:51.542 --> 11:53.333
Your IDenticard says
you're a xenoarchaeologist.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.125
Which means you would have
had access to artifacts

11:55.208 --> 11:57.625
from other worlds, like this.

11:57.708 --> 12:00.125
And what better hiding place
than a statue to a God

12:00.208 --> 12:03.292
your own people would avoid
and the scavengers would ignore

12:03.375 --> 12:06.167
because we all know
that most Drazi statues

12:06.250 --> 12:08.708
have no actual value.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.042
Well, it must've been
a real shock

12:11.125 --> 12:13.000
when you made it
to the safe haven

12:13.083 --> 12:15.750
and you found out the scavenger
fleet was piloted by Drazi

12:15.833 --> 12:18.792
and Shokalla
is the patron saint of pilots.

12:18.875 --> 12:22.417
- Fine, how much do you want?
- Five hundred credit deposit.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.875
Twenty percent of everything
you find inside this thing.

12:23.958 --> 12:25.292
- Ten.
- Fifteen.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.667
And I let you walk out of here
without telling the Drazi

12:26.750 --> 12:29.375
you've been poking holes
in their deities.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.708
Done.

12:31.792 --> 12:35.708
- Let me know if you find it.
- Not if...when.

12:43.333 --> 12:46.583
- Hello, Mr. Garibaldi.
- Hey, Mr. Lennier.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.667
Welcome to my, uh, office.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.542
Something I can do for you?

12:52.625 --> 12:54.750
I had heard that you resigned.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.542
At first, I chose
not to believe it

12:56.625 --> 12:59.833
but now...why?

12:59.917 --> 13:02.125
Well, I, uh,
served my time in hell.

13:02.208 --> 13:05.542
Now I get to make my own life.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.458
Why is that so strange?

13:07.542 --> 13:09.833
With Minbari,
there is no time limit

13:09.917 --> 13:12.833
on serving the needs
of our people. It is an honor.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.292
[laughing]

13:14.375 --> 13:16.625
Well, then, let's just say
I've had all the honor I need

13:16.708 --> 13:18.625
for a while
and leave it at that.

13:18.708 --> 13:20.333
- How's Delenn?
- She's well.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.208
- Good.
- She sends her regards.

13:22.292 --> 13:24.875
- The captain was--
- I, uh..

13:24.958 --> 13:28.500
- I heard Londo's back.
- Yes.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.875
You sure everything's
alright, Mr. Garibaldi?

13:30.958 --> 13:33.917
Oh, yeah, fine, I, uh..

13:34.000 --> 13:37.208
I just don't wanna talk about..

13:37.292 --> 13:39.375
Yep, works every time.

13:39.458 --> 13:42.792
Speak the devil's name
and he shall appear.

13:50.417 --> 13:52.917
- Michael.
- Captain.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.583
Mr. Lennier, I 'd like
you to meet Dan Randall.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.417
He's a journalist from Earth.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.417
I'd like you to show him around.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.458
Well, act as his liaison
while he's here.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.375
Mr. Allan would be--

14:03.458 --> 14:05.042
We need Mr. Randall to believe

14:05.125 --> 14:07.250
that everything he sees
and hears is the truth

14:07.333 --> 14:10.417
and not trumped up
for his benefit.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.875
You could help ease his mind.

14:12.958 --> 14:16.750
Then I am happy to serve.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.375
If you'll come
with me, Mr. Randall.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.250
We will begin your
introduction to the station.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.667
This is the open market.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.792
[intense music]

14:46.125 --> 14:48.625
(male #1)
You work for no one but us.

14:48.708 --> 14:51.250
You work for no one but us.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.792
You work for no one but us.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.333
You work for no one but us.

14:56.417 --> 15:00.208
Us, us, us, us..

15:07.250 --> 15:09.333
[exhales sharply]

15:12.000 --> 15:14.833
[instrumental music]

15:20.292 --> 15:22.500
- So these units--
- As we docked--

15:22.583 --> 15:24.917
You were saying?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.833
As we docked, I saw an
alien ship being fixed outside.

15:28.917 --> 15:31.500
Many ships belonging to
the League of Non-Aligned Worlds

15:31.583 --> 15:34.333
were damaged
during the recent war.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.667
Some of them
would not have made it back

15:36.750 --> 15:39.958
had we not allowed them
to berth here and make repairs.

15:43.958 --> 15:46.917
And do they pay
for these repairs?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.833
Only for
the actual material used.

15:48.917 --> 15:53.792
The time needed to make
the repairs is donated freely.

15:53.875 --> 15:55.458
That's very generous.

15:55.542 --> 15:58.833
[clears throat]
It's the least we could do.

16:04.958 --> 16:06.542
Here we are.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.708
After you, please.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.667
Are we recording?

16:20.917 --> 16:22.375
Where are we now, Lennier?

16:22.458 --> 16:25.250
This part of the station
is known as Down Below.

16:25.333 --> 16:28.500
Babylon 5 has always
had an underclass.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.500
People who come here
in search of a better life

16:30.583 --> 16:33.917
and find themselves stranded
when they run out of money.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.625
They become a cheap work force

16:35.708 --> 16:38.167
for some of the less
reputable businessmen.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.917
- So they're exploited.
- Sometimes, yes.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.667
The captain stops it
when he hears of it.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.083
He's instituted work programs
so that they can earn money

16:45.167 --> 16:47.042
while helping
to repair the station.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.125
More people have come here
since your president

16:49.208 --> 16:51.333
declared martial law on Earth.

16:51.417 --> 16:52.667
- Uh, doctor.
- Yeah.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.000
This is Dr. Stephen Franklin.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.500
In addition to his other duties
he operates

16:55.583 --> 16:56.750
a free clinic
for these people.

16:56.833 --> 16:57.958
Doctor, this is Dan Randall.

16:58.042 --> 16:59.583
He's a, uh,
journalist from Earth.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.417
Oh, yeah, the captain
said you were on your way.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.208
Uh, sorry,
we're in a bit of a hurry.

17:03.292 --> 17:04.583
We just had a case
of cardiac arrest.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.250
Uh, then, perhaps
we can talk later.

17:06.333 --> 17:10.000
Yeah. I-I'll try.
We get busy here.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.583
- Yeah.
- 'Dr. Franklin.'

17:11.667 --> 17:14.125
(woman on speaker)
'The cryo units
are ready for restart.'

17:14.208 --> 17:16.208
(Stephen)
'I'll be right there.'

17:22.667 --> 17:24.500
Perhaps you do not understand

17:24.583 --> 17:26.333
the nature
of my concern, captain.

17:26.417 --> 17:28.167
I understand completely, Londo.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.417
No, I don't think so.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.708
When I said my quarters
were cold

17:31.792 --> 17:35.083
I did not mean, "Oh, I think
it's a little chilly in here.

17:35.167 --> 17:37.083
Perhaps I'll throw
a blanket on the bed."

17:37.167 --> 17:40.208
No, I said it was cold!

17:40.292 --> 17:44.125
As in, "Oh, look,
my left arm has snapped off

17:44.208 --> 17:46.875
like an icicle
and shattered on the floor."

17:46.958 --> 17:49.042
This is highly
inappropriate, captain!

17:49.125 --> 17:51.167
You're right,
there are several other parts

17:51.250 --> 17:52.958
of your body
I'd much rather see snap off.

17:53.042 --> 17:55.625
I see, well, your sense
of humor is very funny.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.917
[instrumental music]

18:02.417 --> 18:06.333
So it was never your intention
to break away from Earth?

18:06.417 --> 18:09.542
No, no, we declared
independence as a last resort

18:09.625 --> 18:12.667
to protest the illegal bombings
of civilian targets

18:12.750 --> 18:14.583
on Mars and Proxima 3.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.292
We'll rejoin Earth Alliance as
soon as President Clark

18:17.375 --> 18:21.375
rescinds the martial law
decree and steps down.

18:21.458 --> 18:25.333
Mm...and do you still contend
that Clark is responsible

18:25.417 --> 18:28.458
for the death of former
President Luis Santiago?

18:28.542 --> 18:32.667
Santiago was an impediment
to Clark's plans.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.500
I mean, with Clark

18:35.583 --> 18:39.167
anything that
gets in the way disappears.

18:39.250 --> 18:44.333
Ambassador Delenn, this must
strike you as very confusing.

18:44.417 --> 18:45.542
Not at all.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.833
This sort of thing
happens everywhere.

18:47.917 --> 18:50.333
Which I suppose is good,
and that it gives all races

18:50.417 --> 18:53.375
something in common and bad

18:53.458 --> 18:55.583
for much the same reason.

18:57.833 --> 19:00.042
I see the two of you
have become very close

19:00.125 --> 19:02.500
over the last few years.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.750
Yes, very.

19:04.833 --> 19:07.792
Any truth to the rumors
you might eventually marry?

19:10.458 --> 19:13.250
Uh, no comment...for now.

19:15.167 --> 19:17.125
Well, as relationships go,
you certainly have

19:17.208 --> 19:18.667
the odds against you.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.042
You were both on different
sides during the Minbari War

19:21.125 --> 19:23.500
and I'm sure
there are other forces

19:23.583 --> 19:25.250
constantly pulling at you.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.583
Of course.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.583
But the heart does not
recognize boundaries

19:28.667 --> 19:32.083
on a map or wars
or political policies.

19:32.167 --> 19:35.708
The heart does
as the heart does.

19:36.917 --> 19:39.667
And if others don't understand?

19:39.750 --> 19:41.417
If they don't understand..

19:41.500 --> 19:43.917
...we will
make them understand.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.250
Then you're not concerned about
the possible repercussions.

19:47.333 --> 19:50.375
It will be a struggle, still..

19:50.458 --> 19:52.542
There is no force in this galaxy

19:52.625 --> 19:55.583
that can stop what we have
done here together.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.875
'Nothing will be
able to stop us.'

19:59.958 --> 20:03.000
[instumental music]

20:10.792 --> 20:11.667
[sighs]

20:11.750 --> 20:13.375
Can I talk to you for a moment?

20:13.458 --> 20:15.208
Where's your entourage?

20:15.292 --> 20:16.792
Picking up
some background shots

20:16.875 --> 20:20.625
of the station
for editing later. Can I sit?

20:20.708 --> 20:22.625
That's between you
and your chiropractor.

20:22.708 --> 20:24.833
I don't get involved.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.667
We're just about done.
Our ship leaves in two hours.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.542
You're the only one
I haven't talked to yet.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.792
Not much point to it.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.458
I'm not responsible
for anyone here but me.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.000
Yeah.

20:42.292 --> 20:43.542
I understand
you recently resigned

20:43.625 --> 20:46.167
as head of security
for Babylon 5.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.792
That's right.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.417
Would you like to talk about it?

20:49.500 --> 20:51.750
Not especially.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.792
Mr. Garibaldi..

21:00.583 --> 21:02.500
'...you're the only one
of the inner circle'

21:02.583 --> 21:06.167
'who's been here ever since
Babylon 5 went online.'

21:06.250 --> 21:08.917
You have a unique perspective.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.333
I'd be remiss if I left here

21:12.417 --> 21:13.958
without getting
a few minutes with you.

21:14.042 --> 21:16.167
Look, you can talk
about anything you want.

21:16.250 --> 21:19.167
Your time here,
what you did during the war.

21:19.250 --> 21:22.458
'Your co-workers,
President Clark, whatever.'

21:24.375 --> 21:26.542
You've got a free shot.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.625
[sighs]

21:36.292 --> 21:39.375
[instrumental music]

21:52.458 --> 21:54.833
Looks like you had
the same idea I did.

21:54.917 --> 21:56.542
Who's got time
for dinner these days?

21:56.625 --> 21:57.833
I just figured
I'd grab something to eat

21:57.917 --> 22:00.208
while we watch the stellarcast.

22:00.292 --> 22:02.333
- Is Delenn coming?
- Ah, she was right behind me.

22:02.417 --> 22:06.000
But Marcus had some questions.

22:06.083 --> 22:09.125
Do you have the same ugly
feeling I have about all this?

22:09.208 --> 22:12.708
I mean, we both know
there's gonna be some bias here.

22:12.792 --> 22:16.083
Well, that's another reason
I went along with this.

22:16.167 --> 22:19.333
We knew they were gonna take
a shot at us sooner or later.

22:19.417 --> 22:22.292
Might as well get it all out in
the open, see what they've got.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.500
We did the best we could,
anything we said

22:24.583 --> 22:26.333
we kept down
to short declarative sentences

22:26.417 --> 22:29.375
to make it harder for them
to quote us out of context.

22:29.458 --> 22:32.542
We didn't have a big crisis
while they were here.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.958
What can they do to us?

22:36.042 --> 22:39.750
- Sorry. Has it started yet?
- Just about.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.917
Well, let's see what's on.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.833
With our luck,
it'll probably be a commercial.

22:48.250 --> 22:49.375
[beeping]

22:50.833 --> 22:53.875
[instrumental music]

23:11.083 --> 23:14.167
(female #1)
'This is an Interstellar
Network News special report.'

23:14.250 --> 23:16.417
'Reporting live
from the ISN Headquarters'

23:16.500 --> 23:20.667
'in Geneva, Switzerland,
your host Alison Higgins.'

23:20.750 --> 23:22.958
Good evening,
almost two week ago

23:23.042 --> 23:26.125
we sent reporter Dan Randall
to get a behind-the-scenes look

23:26.208 --> 23:28.917
at the current situation
on Babylon 5.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.792
Which broke away
from Earth last year

23:30.875 --> 23:33.292
and was recently added
to the forbidden list

23:33.375 --> 23:34.792
for travel and commerce.

23:34.875 --> 23:37.708
We'll have that story for you
later in our broadcast.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.958
First, these headlines..

23:40.042 --> 23:42.792
President Clark announced
today that Earthforce troops

23:42.875 --> 23:45.792
have now reclaimed
75% of the colony

23:45.875 --> 23:50.250
which broke away in an act
of sedition 259 days ago.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.833
Today, to the cheering
of its citizens

23:52.917 --> 23:55.667
they liberated
New Vegas and Flinntown.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.625
To celebrate this latest victory

23:57.708 --> 23:59.750
against the tyranny
of a fanatical few

23:59.833 --> 24:02.500
who have endangered
the lives of our citizens

24:02.583 --> 24:05.542
Clark proclaimed today
a planetary holiday.

24:05.625 --> 24:09.375
Curfew has been extended
two full hours until 9 p.m.

24:09.458 --> 24:13.500
Earth standard time,
so go out and enjoy.

24:13.583 --> 24:15.333
Meanwhile, hearings began today

24:15.417 --> 24:17.333
in the newly-reconstituted
senate

24:17.417 --> 24:19.583
as the committee
on anti-earth activities

24:19.667 --> 24:22.167
heard testimony
from witnesses in the fields

24:22.250 --> 24:25.208
of entertainment,
business, and local politics.

24:25.292 --> 24:27.458
The first day of testimony
confirms

24:27.542 --> 24:30.042
what President Clark
announced late last year

24:30.125 --> 24:32.625
that these and other fields
have been infiltrated

24:32.708 --> 24:37.042
by alien sympathizers determined
to bring down Earthgov.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.167
Each witness named
at least ten people

24:39.250 --> 24:42.042
who will now be taken
into custody and questioned.

24:42.125 --> 24:45.250
The first of these, tri-vid
writer/producer Lee Parks

24:45.333 --> 24:48.667
freely admitted his
involvement in the conspiracy.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.375
I, voluntarily..

24:52.458 --> 24:55.333
confess...that I helped

24:55.417 --> 24:58.333
alien governments
undermine Earthgov

24:58.417 --> 25:01.292
by using my tri-vids

25:01.375 --> 25:03.417
to convey messages

25:03.500 --> 25:07.917
of rebellion,
disregard for authority..

25:09.958 --> 25:13.417
...immorality and violence.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.917
I realize now
that I was being used

25:17.000 --> 25:21.583
by outside forces
to harm my own people.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.958
I apologize..

25:26.875 --> 25:29.875
...to my family

25:29.958 --> 25:32.458
my wife Deborah

25:32.542 --> 25:37.333
and my fellow citizens
for my crimes.

25:39.708 --> 25:44.833
As-assisting me
in these acts of sedition

25:44.917 --> 25:47.583
were tri-vid writer

25:47.667 --> 25:50.000
Carleton Jarrico..

25:52.458 --> 25:54.500
...and actors..

25:56.083 --> 25:58.292
...Beth Trumbo

25:59.375 --> 26:04.083
and...Adrian Mostel.

26:04.167 --> 26:06.708
(Alison)
'Parks was later
conveyed to a hospital'

26:06.792 --> 26:09.292
'where he will receive
proper care and treatment'

26:09.375 --> 26:11.792
'so that he can
one day return to society'

26:11.875 --> 26:14.500
'an active
and productive citizen.'

26:16.458 --> 26:18.583
(female #1)
'This year in history.'

26:19.833 --> 26:22.833
'Three hundred years
ago today, in 1961'

26:22.917 --> 26:25.667
'Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin
became the first human'

26:25.750 --> 26:27.958
'to orbit the Earth.'

26:29.542 --> 26:32.167
'In 1999, North American
President Bill Clinton'

26:32.250 --> 26:35.458
'created the president's
commission on the future.'

26:37.042 --> 26:40.250
'In 2018, the foundation
for Luna Colony was laid'

26:40.333 --> 26:44.000
'in the Sea of Tranquility.'

26:44.083 --> 26:47.500
'And 100 years ago today,
the Psi Corps was created.'

26:50.417 --> 26:52.375
Good evening. I'm Dan Randall.

26:52.458 --> 26:54.667
When we first approached
to the ministry of information

26:54.750 --> 26:58.042
with the idea of traveling
to Babylon 5 for this story

26:58.125 --> 26:59.667
they advised against it.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.000
They believed it would
put the safety of myself

27:02.083 --> 27:03.958
and our news crew in jeopardy.

27:04.042 --> 27:05.625
But the first rule
of journalism is

27:05.708 --> 27:07.667
you go where the story is.

27:07.750 --> 27:11.583
Still, nothing could have
prepared us for what we found.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.167
'From the outside, Babylon 5'

27:14.250 --> 27:15.833
'is all business as usual.'

27:15.917 --> 27:18.375
'Note that ship berthed
outside the station.'

27:18.458 --> 27:20.625
'We'll come back to it.'

27:20.708 --> 27:24.417
'The conditions inside Babylon 5
are another matter altogether.'

27:24.500 --> 27:26.917
'Most of the human residents
have been forced to live'

27:27.000 --> 27:30.833
'in squalid, filthy,
possibly disease-ridden areas'

27:30.917 --> 27:34.542
'of the station, denied proper
sanitation and health care.'

27:34.625 --> 27:36.000
'The better quarters
are reserved'

27:36.083 --> 27:38.333
'for high-ranking alien guests'

27:38.417 --> 27:39.875
'and those who run
the station built'

27:39.958 --> 27:43.792
'with the tax dollars
of many of these citizens.'

27:43.875 --> 27:46.917
'It's ironic that Minbari,
who fought Earth'

27:47.000 --> 27:49.750
'in a war of aggression
have been appointed keepers'

27:49.833 --> 27:52.792
'of these poor,
struggling pockets of humanity'

27:52.875 --> 27:55.375
'trapped in the coldness
of space.'

27:55.458 --> 27:57.333
'Here a high-ranking
Minbari reviews'

27:57.417 --> 27:58.917
'the terrible conditions.'

27:59.000 --> 28:01.792
'Any attempt at protest
is cruelly put down.'

28:01.875 --> 28:05.583
'And those responsible
are sedated and taken away.'

28:05.667 --> 28:09.208
'The question is...taken where?'

28:09.292 --> 28:11.250
'As we toured the station,
it became clear that'

28:11.333 --> 28:15.000
'the alien governments are
calling the shots on Babylon 5.'

28:15.083 --> 28:18.125
'Even the station's renegade
leader John Sheridan appeared'

28:18.208 --> 28:21.875
'subservient to the tempers
of alien representatives.'

28:21.958 --> 28:25.667
'What's not as clear
is why a decorated war hero'

28:25.750 --> 28:28.542
'who fought aliens during the
war and allegedly broke away'

28:28.625 --> 28:31.125
'from Earth
to achieve greater freedom'

28:31.208 --> 28:33.125
'would tolerate such behavior.'

28:33.208 --> 28:36.375
This is highly
inappropriate, captain!

28:36.458 --> 28:38.292
To find some answers
to these questions

28:38.375 --> 28:40.458
we turned to the experts.

28:40.542 --> 28:42.583
Dr. William Indiri
is dean of psychiatry

28:42.667 --> 28:44.875
at Harvard Medical School
and a leading expert

28:44.958 --> 28:48.625
on xenopsychology
and Minbari War Syndrome.

28:48.708 --> 28:51.792
Dr. Indiri, you've seen
the same footage I have.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.833
What's your analysis?

28:53.917 --> 28:56.083
Well, Dan, we have to start off
by remembering that

28:56.167 --> 28:58.208
many veterans
of the Earth/Minbari War

28:58.292 --> 29:01.250
suffer from a kind
of inferiority complex

29:01.333 --> 29:04.000
when it comes to
alien life forms.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.708
Some of my colleagues
have compared it

29:05.792 --> 29:07.625
to the Helsinki Syndrome.

29:07.708 --> 29:10.125
That's where a hostage
begins to identify

29:10.208 --> 29:11.667
with his kidnappers.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.792
And what does this
have to do with Babylon 5?

29:14.875 --> 29:16.833
Well, as I said,
many who fought the Minbari

29:16.917 --> 29:19.458
during the war
felt they were up against

29:19.542 --> 29:22.417
a vastly superior
technological force.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.292
And in fact, at that time
and under that administration

29:25.375 --> 29:27.833
that was correct.

29:27.917 --> 29:30.417
It's not such a great leap
from recognizing

29:30.500 --> 29:33.792
technological superiority
to ascribing

29:33.875 --> 29:35.833
greater ethical and moral values

29:35.917 --> 29:40.333
and even, even genetic
superiority to alien races.

29:40.417 --> 29:42.667
Right here on Earth,
for instance..

29:42.750 --> 29:45.000
...we have the cargo cult,
which saw airplanes

29:45.083 --> 29:47.000
during the 20th century
and assumed

29:47.083 --> 29:49.750
they and their pilots were Gods.

29:49.833 --> 29:51.667
It's much the same thing.

29:51.750 --> 29:54.542
Dr. Indiri,
in your professional opinion

29:54.625 --> 29:56.708
could this Minbari War Syndrome

29:56.792 --> 29:59.542
or an unhealthy
fascination with aliens

29:59.625 --> 30:03.458
cause a person to turn against
his own people, his own race?

30:03.542 --> 30:06.250
It is theoretically
possible, yes.

30:06.333 --> 30:09.167
We all remember the fascination
with alien religions

30:09.250 --> 30:11.208
that gripped Earth culture

30:11.292 --> 30:14.708
after we made our first
contact with the Centauri.

30:14.792 --> 30:17.875
The assumption was
that an advanced species

30:17.958 --> 30:21.375
may be nearer God than we are.

30:21.458 --> 30:23.625
Which was obviously not the case

30:23.708 --> 30:25.375
with the Centauri,
goodness knows.

30:25.458 --> 30:29.250
But it caused many humans to
turn against the belief systems

30:29.333 --> 30:33.208
they had been raised with,
even turn violent.

30:33.292 --> 30:35.250
(Dan)
'Thank you, Dr. Indiri.'

30:36.667 --> 30:38.500
The second rule of journalism is

30:38.583 --> 30:41.083
no one does anything
without a reason.

30:41.167 --> 30:44.000
They may not admit it,
even to themselves

30:44.083 --> 30:45.750
but the reason is there.

30:45.833 --> 30:48.292
To understand what's been
happening on Babylon 5

30:48.375 --> 30:49.750
since their break from Earth

30:49.833 --> 30:52.208
you first have to understand
why.

30:52.292 --> 30:53.875
This puzzle started
to come together

30:53.958 --> 30:55.542
when our cameras
happened to overhear

30:55.625 --> 30:59.708
what would turn out to be
a very important conversation.

30:59.792 --> 31:00.917
Listen carefully.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.500
Uh, then perhaps
we can talk later?

31:02.583 --> 31:06.542
Yeah, uh, I 'll try.
We're a bit busy here.

31:06.625 --> 31:08.250
- Yeah?
- 'Dr. Franklin.'

31:08.333 --> 31:10.625
(woman on speaker)
'The cryo-units
are ready for restart.'

31:10.708 --> 31:12.125
I'll be right there.

31:12.208 --> 31:15.917
A small piece of conversation
overheard by chance.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.792
We'll find out what
those few words really mean

31:18.875 --> 31:21.458
when we come back.

31:22.833 --> 31:25.500
[instrumental music]

31:36.542 --> 31:38.500
(female #1)
'ISN's special report
on Babylon 5'

31:38.583 --> 31:40.667
'continues with Dan Randall.'

31:40.750 --> 31:42.208
Welcome back.

31:42.292 --> 31:44.958
In our last segment, I asked
you to pay special attention

31:45.042 --> 31:48.000
to this ship berthed
outside Babylon 5.

31:48.083 --> 31:50.750
This warship is part of a fleet

31:50.833 --> 31:53.792
created by Sheridan
and Minbari Ambassador Delenn

31:53.875 --> 31:56.958
and was used in their
recent military campaign.

31:57.042 --> 32:00.125
You'll note that station
resources are being used

32:00.208 --> 32:02.500
to outfit and equip the warship.

32:02.583 --> 32:04.833
Once again, alien worlds benefit

32:04.917 --> 32:08.292
while Earth Alliance
taxpayers pay the bills.

32:08.375 --> 32:10.542
But that's not
the full extent of it.

32:10.625 --> 32:12.958
Perhaps coincidentally,
perhaps not

32:13.042 --> 32:16.958
Babylon 5 was fully armed with
state-of-the-art weapons systems

32:17.042 --> 32:19.458
just prior to breaking away
from Earth.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.958
Weapons used to destroy
our own ships

32:22.042 --> 32:23.958
during its act of secession.

32:24.042 --> 32:28.667
Another piece of an
interestingly curious puzzle.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.208
But what does it mean?

32:30.292 --> 32:32.667
Where is the key,
the Rosetta Stone

32:32.750 --> 32:34.833
that will unlock the mystery

32:34.917 --> 32:37.292
the mystery that is Babylon 5?

32:37.375 --> 32:40.792
Is it hidden
or right out in the open?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.833
'I see the two of you
have become very close'

32:42.917 --> 32:45.292
'over the last few years.'

32:45.375 --> 32:47.625
Yes...very.

32:47.708 --> 32:50.917
(Dan)
'Any truth to the rumors
you might eventually marry?'

32:53.875 --> 32:56.375
Uh, no comment...for now.

32:57.958 --> 32:59.958
(Dan)
'Well, as relationships go,
you certainly have'

33:00.042 --> 33:01.542
'the odds against you.'

33:01.625 --> 33:03.917
'You were both on different
sides during the Minbari War.'

33:04.000 --> 33:06.417
'And I'm sure
there are other forces'

33:06.500 --> 33:07.792
'constantly pulling at you.'

33:07.875 --> 33:09.292
Of course.

33:09.375 --> 33:11.208
But the heart
does not recognize boundaries

33:11.292 --> 33:14.667
on a map or wars
or political policies.

33:14.750 --> 33:18.083
The heart does...as the heart
does.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.875
(Dan)
'Then you are
not concerned about'

33:20.958 --> 33:23.458
'the possible repercussions?'

33:23.542 --> 33:25.125
It will be a struggle.

33:25.208 --> 33:28.208
- A struggle against Earth?
- 'Of course.'

33:28.292 --> 33:30.167
(Delenn)
'If they don't understand'

33:30.250 --> 33:31.958
'we will make them understand.'

33:32.042 --> 33:35.792
Anything that gets
in the way disappears.

33:37.250 --> 33:39.250
There's a lot of people
back home who might be

33:39.333 --> 33:41.083
concerned about
what you're saying.

33:41.167 --> 33:43.458
It sounds as if you're putting
the mingling of human

33:43.542 --> 33:45.958
and Minbari above the safety
of your own world.

33:46.042 --> 33:48.208
There's no force
in the galaxy that can stop

33:48.292 --> 33:51.250
what we have done here together.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.000
Nothing will be able to stop us.

33:54.083 --> 33:58.417
"Nothing will stop what
we have done here together."

33:58.500 --> 34:01.542
If this sounds troubling,
there may be good reason.

34:01.625 --> 34:05.292
While on Babylon 5, I managed
to speak with Michael Garibaldi

34:05.375 --> 34:07.250
former head of security
for the station

34:07.333 --> 34:11.292
who resigned recently
under mysterious conditions.

34:11.375 --> 34:15.125
Look, don't get me wrong,
I like Sheridan, he's..

34:15.208 --> 34:16.458
I don't know,
he's just different

34:16.542 --> 34:18.917
since he got back
from alien space.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.875
You know, sometimes he thinks
he's the Second Coming.

34:21.958 --> 34:24.083
He-he-he has like a god complex.

34:24.167 --> 34:27.083
You can't talk to him anymore.
He doesn't listen.

34:27.167 --> 34:28.417
Well, that's-that's not true.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.000
He-he listens to Delenn,
this other alien Lorien

34:31.083 --> 34:32.708
who was here for a while,
maybe a few others.

34:32.792 --> 34:36.917
I-I just wasn't comfortable
with the situation anymore.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.833
You know, he, thinks he knows
what's best for everybody else.

34:39.917 --> 34:43.792
Now, maybe that goes
with being a CO, but this..

34:43.875 --> 34:47.625
[sighs]
I just think
he's gone over the top.

34:47.708 --> 34:50.292
(Dan)
'Do you think you'll get into
trouble for saying this?'

34:50.375 --> 34:53.375
[chuckles]
Yeah, probably.

34:54.625 --> 34:58.000
Somebody's got to say something.

34:58.083 --> 35:01.583
With information we received
from sources aboard Babylon 5

35:01.667 --> 35:05.292
we were able to slip into a
restricted area on the station.

35:05.375 --> 35:09.792
What you are
about to see may shock you.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.375
We're standing in an area
immediately adjacent

35:12.458 --> 35:14.167
to the Medlab facilities.

35:14.250 --> 35:15.667
We've just seen
several stretchers

35:15.750 --> 35:17.833
with unconscious humans
moving down this hall

35:17.917 --> 35:19.583
to a room at the far end.

35:19.667 --> 35:22.250
We're trying to
get a better look.

35:24.250 --> 35:28.000
These are
cryogenic freezer units.

35:28.083 --> 35:30.042
Babylon 5 is not supposed
to maintain

35:30.125 --> 35:33.583
more than four or five these
cryo units at any given time

35:33.667 --> 35:36.083
and only within when required
by a medical emergency

35:36.167 --> 35:38.875
until they can be sent back
to Earth for treatment.

35:38.958 --> 35:42.750
There are at least 20 here
or 30 of these units here.

35:42.833 --> 35:44.833
And these names..

35:46.583 --> 35:48.250
'...we checked
the station manifest'

35:48.333 --> 35:51.542
'and these names do not appear
on any of the passenger'

35:51.625 --> 35:54.167
'crew or travel logs.'

35:54.250 --> 35:58.083
So, where did these
people come from

35:58.167 --> 36:01.042
and what are they doing here?

36:01.125 --> 36:03.792
We've got to go.
Now! Move. Come on.

36:03.875 --> 36:06.000
We were looking
for a Rosetta Stone.

36:06.083 --> 36:08.125
We may have found it
in the cryogenic lockers

36:08.208 --> 36:10.583
with their cargo
of frozen humans.

36:10.667 --> 36:13.625
Now we can begin
to see a picture forming.

36:13.708 --> 36:16.042
'An imprisoned
population of humans'

36:16.125 --> 36:19.583
'powerless, homeless,
unable to escape'

36:19.667 --> 36:22.167
'who won't be missed
if they disappear.'

36:22.250 --> 36:24.125
'When they do vanish,
they're taken away'

36:24.208 --> 36:25.583
'by medical personnel.'

36:25.667 --> 36:29.208
'Stored in cryogenic suspension
and taken out as needed.'

36:29.292 --> 36:33.542
'Their records erased from
the central computer system.'

36:33.625 --> 36:37.500
'Meanwhile, alien ships
are being built, repaired'

36:37.583 --> 36:40.125
'and equipped
outside the station.'

36:41.583 --> 36:45.958
You don't assemble a fleet
unless you intend to use it.

36:46.042 --> 36:49.083
So what's the next target
for this so-called

36:49.167 --> 36:52.250
last, best hope for peace?

36:52.333 --> 36:54.792
We're finally prepared
to answer that question.

36:54.875 --> 36:57.458
We believe that answer
will shock some of you

36:57.542 --> 37:01.292
horrify others
and anger all of you.

37:01.375 --> 37:05.708
We'll have that and some
concluding thoughts, after this.

37:08.542 --> 37:11.583
[instrumental music]

37:17.083 --> 37:18.875
Welcome back.

37:18.958 --> 37:21.250
We have one last
interview to show you.

37:21.333 --> 37:25.958
It's brief, but telling,
not so much for what's said..

37:26.042 --> 37:28.167
...but for what's denied.

37:28.750 --> 37:31.417
All clear.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.667
Our jobs here are to serve
the needs of both

37:34.750 --> 37:36.375
the human and alien populations.

37:36.458 --> 37:38.917
Now, that can be
very difficult some days.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.708
The different biologies
mean what cures

37:40.792 --> 37:43.167
one race kills another.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.042
(Dan)
'And how long do patients
stay here on average?'

37:46.125 --> 37:47.708
Well, just a, just a few days.

37:47.792 --> 37:50.333
We're not really set up
to handle long-term care.

37:50.417 --> 37:52.250
(Dan)
'Then you don't use
cryogenic suspension'

37:52.333 --> 37:55.250
'to freeze patients
for work later?'

37:55.333 --> 37:58.917
Very rarely,
and only in extreme cases.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.833
(Dan)
'And at the moment?'

38:00.917 --> 38:04.458
No, no, we-we don't have
anyone in cryo right now.

38:04.542 --> 38:07.167
- 'No one?'
- That's right.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.125
Rule number 3.

38:10.208 --> 38:13.833
People only lie when
they have something to hide.

38:13.917 --> 38:16.542
We know there are humans
in cryo at Babylon 5.

38:16.625 --> 38:18.708
We saw them, as did you.

38:18.792 --> 38:20.917
So what are they hiding?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.125
I'd like to turn back
to Dr. Indiri for a moment.

38:25.875 --> 38:29.750
Dr. Indiri, does any of what
you've seen here worry you?

38:29.833 --> 38:32.958
- Yes, it does, Dan.
- Why?

38:34.625 --> 38:37.667
Well, over the years
since the Minbari War

38:37.750 --> 38:40.167
from time to time,
we have seen cases

38:40.250 --> 38:41.875
of Minbari War Syndrome

38:41.958 --> 38:45.542
develop into cases
of severe pathology.

38:45.625 --> 38:49.875
The worship of alien races turns
into a kind of self-hatred.

38:49.958 --> 38:51.917
We have had cases
of self-mutilation

38:52.000 --> 38:53.917
attempts to look more alien

38:54.000 --> 38:56.417
and some cases that..

38:56.500 --> 39:00.000
Well, these are too extreme
for your audience to hear.

39:00.083 --> 39:03.750
The point being, radical
cases of Minbari War Syndrome

39:03.833 --> 39:08.417
can lead to the desire
to become alien oneself.

39:08.500 --> 39:12.083
And to make others
around you the same way.

39:12.167 --> 39:14.292
So you're saying that
Captain Sheridan

39:14.375 --> 39:17.542
could be sick,
mentally disturbed.

39:18.708 --> 39:20.083
Hmm..

39:20.167 --> 39:25.000
Dan, I don't like to make
long-distance diagnoses

39:25.083 --> 39:26.750
but, yes,
that would be my assessment

39:26.833 --> 39:29.083
based on what I've seen here.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.333
And if he is unstable

39:31.417 --> 39:33.250
that might make it easier
for others to use him

39:33.333 --> 39:36.083
for their own purposes.

39:36.167 --> 39:40.625
Well, he would certainly be more
receptive to alien influence

39:40.708 --> 39:44.625
and more prone
to obey orders from aliens.

39:44.708 --> 39:47.042
Thank you, Dr. Indiri.

39:47.125 --> 39:49.125
You've seen the same
evidence we have..

39:49.208 --> 39:52.125
...heard directly from the
players involved in this story.

39:52.208 --> 39:55.125
The truth, as always,
is self-evident

39:55.208 --> 39:58.917
once you find the key,
and this is the key.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.833
The key to medical experiments
conducted on humans

40:01.917 --> 40:03.625
kept in cryogenic freeze

40:03.708 --> 40:07.000
the key to Sheridan's heart
by his own admission

40:07.083 --> 40:11.458
the key to their fleet
and their plan for humanity.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.792
Perhaps the Minbari surrendered
at the battle of the line

40:13.875 --> 40:16.833
because they had come up with
a better way to conquer Earth.

40:16.917 --> 40:20.292
Not with the sword,
but with the genetic code.

40:20.375 --> 40:23.875
Has the war really ended,
or has it simply changed shape?

40:23.958 --> 40:26.375
Has Sheridan's self-hatred
grown into a desire

40:26.458 --> 40:30.583
to save humanity
by making us into them?

40:30.667 --> 40:33.750
A program to mix human
and Minbari DNA sounds absurd

40:33.833 --> 40:37.500
fantastic, but it's already
been done once.

40:37.583 --> 40:39.833
Delenn has shown him the way.

40:39.917 --> 40:42.167
Half-human, half-Minbari.

40:42.250 --> 40:45.250
She did it. Why can't we?

40:45.333 --> 40:47.500
If it's good enough
for the woman he loves

40:47.583 --> 40:49.250
why not everyone else?

40:49.333 --> 40:51.833
And if we choose not to
cooperate, if we do not see

40:51.917 --> 40:55.625
the wisdom in his
alien-influenced logic..

40:55.708 --> 40:57.833
...then there's an
alien fleet waiting and ready

40:57.917 --> 41:01.125
to be used against us,
his own people

41:01.208 --> 41:03.875
as he did once before.

41:03.958 --> 41:07.292
'Is this the face
of humanity's future?'

41:07.375 --> 41:09.292
'Sheridan's future?'

41:10.583 --> 41:12.417
The fault, however,
is not his own.

41:12.500 --> 41:15.958
The fault is ours,
for not seeing his condition

41:16.042 --> 41:17.875
in time to deal with it.

41:17.958 --> 41:21.042
It is my belief that
he is not an evil person.

41:21.125 --> 41:24.125
He only needs our help
to come back to us.

41:25.500 --> 41:28.375
Minbari War Syndrome
is a very real problem.

41:28.458 --> 41:29.875
Add to that
the pressures of command

41:29.958 --> 41:31.417
and the loss
of his family's home

41:31.500 --> 41:34.000
when their farm was burned
to the ground last week

41:34.083 --> 41:36.875
his father still missing.

41:36.958 --> 41:39.708
Our job is to report the news

41:39.792 --> 41:42.833
not to make it or guide it.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.917
But from this
reporter's perspective

41:45.000 --> 41:48.125
the situation on Babylon 5
is deteriorating quickly

41:48.208 --> 41:50.083
and must be dealt with.

41:50.167 --> 41:52.458
The quarantine order
will help prevent more humans

41:52.542 --> 41:55.917
from falling prey
to this genetics program.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.458
But it's only
a short-term solution.

41:58.542 --> 42:01.667
As for Sheridan,
he does not deserve our scorn

42:01.750 --> 42:04.250
our anger or our contempt.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.458
He is a war veteran,
and that should at least

42:06.542 --> 42:08.708
earn him our sympathy.

42:08.792 --> 42:12.417
We here at ISN hope he receives
the best care possible

42:12.500 --> 42:15.417
so he can someday
come back to us.

42:16.792 --> 42:19.250
This is Dan Randall for ISN.

42:19.333 --> 42:21.375
Goodnight.

42:58.125 --> 42:59.583
[beeps]

43:04.417 --> 43:06.833
[theme music]
