00:56.390 --> 00:57.656
Hey, Sam.

00:57.658 --> 01:01.393
Mother, you had me

01:03.030 --> 01:05.798
but I never had you

01:11.772 --> 01:15.641
I wanted you

01:17.411 --> 01:20.479
you didn't want me

01:27.188 --> 01:30.389
Frankie. Soccer.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.791
Frankie.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.861
Hi, baby.
I'm sick.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.529
Oh, no.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.631
100.1.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.100
That's barely a thing.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.802
Mom, we're not supposed
to go to soccer over 100.

01:43.804 --> 01:47.039
Children's Tylenol is gonna
knock that right down.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.475
Mom, that's not a cure. That's
just a mask of the symptoms.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.210
I could still get
other kids sick.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.945
I'm like patient zero.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.613
Dude, you're gonna be running
around a field,

01:54.615 --> 01:56.882
not kissing everybody.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.951
Mom, I really
don't feel good.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.386
But it's my day for snack.

02:03.657 --> 02:07.426
I got cuties and this shit.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.328
Hey, Sam. Hey.
Hey.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.664
Where's-where's
Frankie?
Uh, well, she's sick.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.433
Aw.
Or she says.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.302
But I have snacks, so great.
I know. Yeah, I...

02:17.304 --> 02:19.071
Well, I hate when that
happens, you know?

02:19.073 --> 02:20.806
I had to chaperone
this school field trip

02:20.808 --> 02:22.074
when flo was sick,
you know?

02:22.076 --> 02:23.909
Ugh.
This, uh, museum...

02:23.911 --> 02:26.478
God... museum of something
or something. I can't...

02:26.480 --> 02:28.580
Yeah.
Hi, Sam.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.817
Hi. Hi, Francis.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.285
How you doing
with all this?

02:33.287 --> 02:35.587
Uh, all of what?

02:35.589 --> 02:38.957
Thera's mom, her surgery.
Are you okay?

02:38.959 --> 02:41.126
Yeah, i-I'm okay.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.794
Is she okay?

02:42.796 --> 02:45.197
She's really nervous
about the surgery.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.999
You know, as we all are.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.934
I didn't want to put this
in the e-mail.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.370
Oh, it's, uh worse
than in the e-mail?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.704
They're opening up
her stomach.

02:52.706 --> 02:56.008
There could be blockage,
infections.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.976
They might have to remove
part of her intestine.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.012
I mean, she could wind up
with a colostomy bag.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.280
Ooh.
Ooh.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.682
But still, it'll be worth it.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.217
For who?

03:06.120 --> 03:08.620
I mean, sure, yes.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.557
Will you just pray
for her tomorrow?

03:11.559 --> 03:14.893
Oh, did she ask for that...
The praying?

03:14.895 --> 03:17.996
Okay, but it
can't hurt.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.032
No, I mean, it's just that

03:20.034 --> 03:22.467
she's really not a god person.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.503
You know, she got upset
when the new people

03:24.505 --> 03:26.171
tried to do the team
circle prayer thing.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.739
Well, it's not
about that.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.741
It's about the power
of group consciousness

03:29.743 --> 03:31.276
helping her heal.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.147
Yeah, is there
another thing I can do

03:35.149 --> 03:37.349
besides praying?

03:37.351 --> 03:38.850
Oh, you know what?

03:38.852 --> 03:41.119
You should sign up
to play with her cat.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.789
Mm.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.826
Mm, yeah.

03:49.363 --> 03:52.064
Excuse me. Flo?
Yeah.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.276
Do you have
a living will?

04:05.379 --> 04:08.080
Good evening to you.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.514
Seriously, do you
have a plan?

04:09.516 --> 04:12.284
Because I think
i should know it.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.753
Well,
your grandfather,

04:14.755 --> 04:16.688
my father,
was diabetic,

04:16.690 --> 04:19.124
and you can lose your legs
to diabetes,

04:19.125 --> 04:21.125
which would be devastating.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.394
My best feature

04:22.396 --> 04:25.197
are my legs. And I think
if somebody told me

04:25.199 --> 04:27.199
I was gonna lose
my legs to diabetes,

04:27.201 --> 04:29.368
I would probably
just pay the Piper.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.470
You mean kill yourself?

04:31.472 --> 04:33.772
I think that's
the way to do it.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.743
Because I don't want you
to have to look after me, and...

04:37.745 --> 04:40.779
I never want to be a burden.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.581
You don't want to be a burden?

04:42.583 --> 04:45.317
Oh, never.

04:45.319 --> 04:48.887
In fact, after Felicia
had her stroke...

04:48.889 --> 04:51.490
Oh...
No one could find
her pin numbers,

04:51.492 --> 04:53.892
and all her money's
locked up, so you must

04:53.894 --> 04:56.161
have my pin numbers.
Okay.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.830
So my bank
pin number is

04:58.832 --> 05:00.999
3-9-6-7.
Mom, mom...

05:01.001 --> 05:02.267
Mom, stop.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.669
Well, we have to
be prepared.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.737
Okay, bye.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.409
Jesus. 103.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.444
Did nan give
you medicine?

05:12.446 --> 05:14.212
No.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.353
The grape kind.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.422
I know.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.963
Mm.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.532
That feel good?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.637
Do I have to drink all of it?
Yes.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.272
Why?
Drink it all.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.007
You need even more
than that, too.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.480
Good job.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.015
Baby...
Mom, it's gross.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.650
I know.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.386
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.789
I wish I could
take it out of you

05:57.791 --> 06:00.292
and put it into me.
I'm sorry.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.127
But then it wouldn't help me.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.230
'Cause I'd be sick, and
you'd be like, "mom, get up."

06:05.232 --> 06:07.332
Oh, I thought you
meant the medicine.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.900
No.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.981
Two.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.050
Up, three.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.519
Four. Let me see you
arch back lightly.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.921
Five.
Nice, pretty line.

06:29.923 --> 06:33.225
Six. And nice straight back.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.994
Two. Scoot.
And three.

06:35.996 --> 06:39.164
Look up. Four.
Arch back,

06:39.166 --> 06:40.699
and five.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.368
Six and seven.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.571
Tendu, second,
and eight.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.384
So there's, like, me
before I've had an ipa,

07:32.386 --> 07:33.652
and then there's me
seconds after.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.387
And they're distinct versions.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.156
One is just so much more
at peace with himself, you know?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.258
'Cause, like, I'm-I'm
a stressed-out guy.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.294
You know, it's-it's
a hard racket I'm in.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.263
And just after that sweet kiss
of an ipa, I just kind of...

07:47.734 --> 07:50.268
you know what that is?
Yeah, so my buddy
and I...

07:50.270 --> 07:52.737
That's a first date.
And it's bad.

07:52.739 --> 07:56.308
Why are you
listening to them?

07:56.310 --> 07:59.744
God, you are so intrusive.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.980
Because you're
on your phone.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.518
Mom, don't.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.086
I have to help her.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.255
No.
Mom, I will kill you.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.523
Do not get up.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.792
Then you have to talk to me.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.628
Mom, I'm in a group chat.
It's a big thing,

08:16.630 --> 08:18.697
and there's, like,
a potentially bullying thing.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.465
Dakota is just
having the worst...

08:20.467 --> 08:21.833
Mom, don't!

08:21.835 --> 08:24.769
Excuse me. Hi.
Can we use your salt?

08:24.771 --> 08:28.139
What?
Hi. You're so cute.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.343
You two don't know each other
very well, do you?

08:31.345 --> 08:34.346
I met him at the gym.
This is our first date.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.813
I know.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.115
How do you know?

08:37.116 --> 08:39.951
Well, I can tell.
And he's gross.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.820
And he hasn't stopped talking.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.689
Well, we're just getting
to know each other.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.025
I know all about him.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.994
You know, the real estate thing,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.328
commercial real estate,

08:50.330 --> 08:52.063
selling office space,

08:52.065 --> 08:54.032
the printer guy
who wouldn't move out.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.667
And I'm sorry about his sister.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.002
That's the one thing.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.503
That was bad.
That was really bad.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.505
But, I mean, give you a second,

09:00.507 --> 09:02.240
I have heard nothing about you.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.575
Mom, that...

09:03.577 --> 09:05.243
Is that your daughter?
Yeah.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.678
Yes. I'm so sorry
she's bothering you.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.079
Mom, I'll talk to you now.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.648
She's not bothering me.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.351
Oh, he's coming back.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.720
Hi.
You know what?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.422
You should
sit over there, because

09:17.424 --> 09:19.524
you both don't listen,
and I will sit here

09:19.526 --> 09:20.926
with your lovely date,

09:20.928 --> 09:22.561
who you
don't notice.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.095
Mom?

09:25.499 --> 09:27.499
Hi.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.568
Ew.
Ew.
Ew.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.275
Okay, so the categories

09:37.277 --> 09:40.078
are, uh, state schools,

09:40.080 --> 09:41.713
private universities.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.248
Then you have
the Ivy league schools,

09:43.250 --> 09:44.916
but you needed to be
thinking about that

09:44.918 --> 09:46.384
a couple of years ago.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.387
Uh, what you need to do
is start focusing on

09:49.389 --> 09:51.089
what you're going to study.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.391
And you need to start taking
the test prep right away.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.895
Now, there are some schools
that put more weight on

09:56.897 --> 09:59.397
the interview
and your extracurricular,

09:59.399 --> 10:01.933
but most of these schools
won't even consider you

10:01.935 --> 10:04.703
if you are not testing
in at least the top 90%,

10:04.705 --> 10:06.371
so you need
to get these scores up.

10:06.373 --> 10:10.275
Might I suggest to you
junior college?

10:14.381 --> 10:15.947
Trevor got back
from college,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.716
and, uh, he has a
girlfriend over there,

10:17.718 --> 10:19.384
but he's still
scamming on lizzy.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.286
It's so gross.
Yeah.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.089
He wants to take her to Tahoe
this summer with his family.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.657
Whatever.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.927
You know what we should
do this summer?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.396
Get a cabin at Joshua tree.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.797
There's this resort there
that's stripped down,

10:32.799 --> 10:35.300
but you can just
go squat in the cabins.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.268
We could spend
the whole summer there.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.571
Just tell our moms that we're
like, at camp or something,

10:39.573 --> 10:43.074
and just do mushrooms
the whole summer at Joshua tree.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.806
God.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.777
So, what did he actually say?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.512
I mean, you were
up in the stirrups...

11:20.514 --> 11:21.946
I'm in the stirrups,
I'm literally seconds away

11:21.948 --> 11:22.947
<i>from my first abortion.</i>

11:22.949 --> 11:24.349
<i>Your first abortion?
Yes.</i>

11:24.351 --> 11:26.351
Jesus, you painted woman.
No need
to comment further. And,

11:26.353 --> 11:27.819
um, the doctor, um...

11:27.821 --> 11:29.354
Turns and says that
there's a problem,

11:29.356 --> 11:31.289
and I'm like, "oh, god, what?"
And he says,

11:31.291 --> 11:33.191
"um, I can't do the abortion

11:33.193 --> 11:34.726
because you are not pregnant."

11:37.230 --> 11:39.798
Oh, just
perfect.
I'm gonna go to my room.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.499
I love you, baby.
I don't know
how it happened.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.835
I felt a kick,
i tell you.
Night-night.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.806
Oh, bubba.

11:47.808 --> 11:51.009
Oh, good, that's given me
fodder for the next year.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.477
Jesus, Macy,
you're so stupid.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.978
I'm not stupid.
That's not a word

11:53.980 --> 11:55.213
that I would have
chosen to use.
Oh, honey.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.514
"Oh, honey."
That's a friend.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.416
That's what
you'd say.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.517
Um...

11:59.519 --> 12:01.386
Night.
Good night, honey.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.987
I don't know, anyway.
Anyway, that's the thing.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.590
I love you.
Good night, poppy.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.559
Good night.
Sleep well.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.994
Okay, I have a question.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.596
How many abortions
in this room?

12:11.598 --> 12:14.099
Tressa, tressa?
Oh, I am not telling.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.501
I... I went with my mom
when she got an abortion.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.736
What?
What?

12:17.738 --> 12:19.104
Yeah, I did.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.405
You never told me that.
I did.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.573
You did?
Yes, I did.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.707
How old were you

12:22.709 --> 12:24.709
when it happened?
I was 16.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.578
And my mom
got pregnant,

12:26.580 --> 12:27.946
and she couldn't tell my dad.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.681
Yeah.
Oh.

12:29.683 --> 12:32.083
So... it wasn't his.
Was it his?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.686
You know,
i... I don't even know.

12:34.688 --> 12:36.788
But she trusted me
and we-we went

12:36.790 --> 12:40.058
to abort my brother
or whatever, so...

12:40.060 --> 12:42.127
Right?
Whoa.
Wow.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.362
I know.
Wow.
That's amazing.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.464
Isn't it crazy?
That should be a play.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.733
Yeah.
You need
to write that.

12:48.735 --> 12:52.403
I... I tried. I can never
write real things, you know?

12:52.405 --> 12:54.139
So... I don't know.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.707
Can I use it?

12:55.709 --> 12:58.409
Wow.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.044
What?
Unbelievable.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.246
What? It's good.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.747
Oh, my god, Nora ephron.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.716
Is... is that okay?
Yeah, it's fine.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.621
with my life.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.656
Oh?

13:11.658 --> 13:15.260
I'm really confused.

13:15.262 --> 13:18.596
And I'm never
getting into college.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.098
Oh, honey,

13:20.100 --> 13:22.834
yes you are.
All you need to do is all the...

13:22.836 --> 13:25.336
Mom.
Sam.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.945
I had to start trying
to be that kind of smart

13:33.947 --> 13:37.916
a long time go.

13:37.918 --> 13:41.152
And I've wasted so much time

13:41.154 --> 13:43.421
just being social.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.824
It's such a waste.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.763
And I look back at the last...

13:51.765 --> 13:54.265
I-i don't know, three years?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.604
I have just been a loser.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.508
Getting high.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.112
Just drama with my friends.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.686
And I am just now
starting to realize

14:14.688 --> 14:16.354
that I am going to be,

14:16.356 --> 14:19.357
like, 18

14:19.359 --> 14:21.292
in two years.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.499
And it's like...

14:28.501 --> 14:30.902
I already blew it.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.372
That's how it feels.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.384
You know, honey,

14:46.386 --> 14:49.454
I felt exactly like that
when I was your age.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.924
And when I was 20.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.094
And this morning.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.831
Right? And now she runs
her own company, so...

14:59.833 --> 15:01.866
I'm gonna let you in on a...

15:01.868 --> 15:04.168
Big, fat secret
that we all know about life.

15:04.170 --> 15:07.171
And that is that you don't
ever figure it out,

15:07.173 --> 15:09.540
and you're always behind,
and it's kind of

15:09.542 --> 15:11.576
always unfair, frankly. Right?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.244
Mm-hmm.
So... you know?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.046
Yeah.
You're on schedule.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.180
Yeah.
That's right.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.383
Oh, Sam, don't cry.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.919
Oh, no!

15:20.921 --> 15:22.253
Oh, Jesus, mom.
Look what you did
to your mother.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.888
It's all right,

15:23.890 --> 15:27.025
yeah?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.027
That's my wine!

15:29.029 --> 15:31.930
You stole it out of my garage.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.869
You... what are you doing?

15:37.871 --> 15:40.905
Come here.
Are you cold?

15:40.907 --> 15:42.974
No.
Come and sit.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.276
I was quite looking forward
to a nightcap.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.579
Is this your nightie now?
Well, I forgot

15:48.581 --> 15:49.881
where my pajamas were.

15:49.883 --> 15:51.649
Thank you. Thank you.
Of course.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.452
Um, so this is a sort of party
going on without me.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.087
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

15:56.089 --> 15:58.056
It's not a party
without you, phyl.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.557
Yeah.
No.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.326
You know what?
Mm-hmm?

16:01.328 --> 16:03.494
You look good.
Oh!

16:03.496 --> 16:05.697
You do. You look good, yeah.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.737
How much am I gonna get,
do you think?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.472
Well, honey, you can
start counting it.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.507
N... no, don't count.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.676
I want to find out once
she gives us the money.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.944
Okay, okay.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.746
Is this all the nickels?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.815
Uh, yes.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.316
Nice piggy bank.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.286
Oh, well, this is
Martin Luther King bank.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.122
That's what she calls it,
even though it's a pig.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.890
Oh.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.494
How old are you?
Can I ask?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.529
I'm 25.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.932
So how did you get this job?

16:40.934 --> 16:44.602
When did you start
going down this road?

16:44.604 --> 16:48.206
I did the training program
when I was 22.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.608
Did you go to college?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.043
No. Ged.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.178
Really?
Yeah.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.547
And that is 20, 40,

16:56.549 --> 16:59.217
65, and...

16:59.219 --> 17:00.818
75 cents left over.

17:00.820 --> 17:01.886
How much?

17:01.888 --> 17:04.856
$65.75, son.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.790
Yes!

17:06.792 --> 17:08.459
Okay.
I got it.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.660
Did you bring a wallet?

17:09.662 --> 17:10.994
No. Left it at home.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.730
You told me you would.
I can just...

17:12.732 --> 17:13.998
Your responsibility for money.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.333
I will hold this.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.800
Don't forget
Martin Luther King.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.102
Oh!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.906
Thank you.
You're welcome.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.608
Hello.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.515
What did you guys get?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.984
<i>String candy and earrings
with my money.</i>

17:32.986 --> 17:34.852
Well, that's
not fair.
Max.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.055
Maxie. Max?

17:37.057 --> 17:39.424
Max. Max.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.425
Max.
What?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.826
Get your shoes.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.594
Come down,
I'm taking you somewhere.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.763
Where?
Just come down.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.598
Wait, why does she get to go?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.068
Because she gets to.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.702
You're staying with Duke.
What?

17:51.704 --> 17:52.937
It's okay.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.205
Mm.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.440
Uh...
Mm-mmm.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.774
Mom!

18:02.348 --> 18:03.815
Mom!

18:16.463 --> 18:20.198
Hey, so why'd you bring me
to go shopping for your clothes?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.666
Come on.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.140
Come on, let me see.
Mom.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.309
Just come on, let me see.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.060
Come here.

18:54.901 --> 18:58.436
Listen, baby.
Your future is yours.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.638
You could be anything you want.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.974
You know those people
that you see every day?

19:02.976 --> 19:05.243
That look like
they have their shit together

19:05.245 --> 19:07.845
and they made
all the right choices?

19:07.847 --> 19:11.649
And how impossible it seems
just to get to that place?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.351
Well, look.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.186
Look at you.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.522
You look like
one of those people.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.958
And all they did
was put on the clothes.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.293
And honey,

19:22.295 --> 19:25.096
you can be anything
you want to be.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.532
Seriously.
But also,

19:27.534 --> 19:30.801
if you just get
a job and get by,

19:30.803 --> 19:32.937
you're still
gonna love your life.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.605
Because life is good.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.108
Even at its worst.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.648
You came here just
to say that to me?

19:43.650 --> 19:45.216
Why? Was it shitty?

19:45.218 --> 19:47.018
I thought it was
gonna be good.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.955
It wasn't shitty,
you liked it.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.857
Mm-hmm.
I love you.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.793
I love you, too.
I love you, too.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.395
I love you.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.030
Don't worry.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.133
I love you.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.640
Your ass looks good in these.
Look.

20:11.244 --> 20:14.245
Though I am nothing big
to offer

20:16.683 --> 20:21.385
I watch the birds
how they dive in then gone

20:21.387 --> 20:23.054
it's like nothing

20:23.056 --> 20:27.792
in this world's ever still

20:33.199 --> 20:39.070
and I'm just a shadow
of your thoughts in me

20:39.072 --> 20:42.173
but sun is setting,
shadows growing

20:44.744 --> 20:49.113
a long cast figure
will turn into night

20:49.115 --> 20:51.515
it's like nothing

20:51.517 --> 20:56.354
in this world ever sleeps

21:00.059 --> 21:03.227
oh, sometimes the blues

21:03.229 --> 21:06.697
is just a passing bird

21:06.699 --> 21:08.132
and why can't...
