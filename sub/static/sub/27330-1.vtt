01:46.221 --> 01:47.384
stop dicking me around.

01:47.384 --> 01:48.217
You know they're not gonna go for that.

01:48.217 --> 01:49.165
- [Jimmy] Kate, you
stop dicking me around.

01:49.165 --> 01:50.076
- [Kate] It's all or nothing.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.270
We don't need your account, remember that.

01:51.270 --> 01:52.298
- [Jimmy] The street says different, Kate.

01:52.298 --> 01:53.937
- [Kate] Fine, I'll throw
in a dinner at Mastro's

01:53.937 --> 01:56.130
and show some extra cleavage
for the execs, how's that?

01:56.130 --> 01:57.317
- [Jimmy] Great, how
low cut are we talking?

01:57.317 --> 01:58.275
- We got a deal, huh?

01:58.275 --> 01:59.617
- [Jimmy] Eh, fine.

01:59.617 --> 02:00.701
- Sucker!

02:00.701 --> 02:02.412
Thanks, Jimmy, always a pleasure.

02:02.412 --> 02:03.360
See you Thursday.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.193

02:17.314 --> 02:20.069
Yeah, you still on for hot yoga?

02:20.069 --> 02:23.263
No, no, you know I can't
take Arnold's class.

02:23.263 --> 02:25.350
Every time he does
downward dog, I lose focus,

02:25.350 --> 02:26.684
and then he comes over
to straighten me out,

02:26.684 --> 02:28.047
it's like fuck me, you know?

02:28.047 --> 02:29.521
Don't be such a prude.

02:29.521 --> 02:31.189
I'll see you this weekend?

02:31.189 --> 02:32.772
All right, goodbye.

02:34.109 --> 02:36.726
Alexis, play nature sounds.

02:36.885 --> 02:38.992
(birds chirping)

02:38.992 --> 02:39.825
Mmm.

02:51.759 --> 02:52.592
(exhaling loudly)

02:53.945 --> 02:58.144
And we couldn't hire a
moving company because?

02:58.144 --> 02:59.784
(doorbell rings)

02:59.784 --> 03:00.759
See?

03:00.759 --> 03:02.796
It's a sign, right, Alexis?

03:02.796 --> 03:04.274
- [Alexis] I don't understand.

03:04.274 --> 03:05.491
- Of course you don't.

03:05.508 --> 03:07.925
(soft guitar music)

03:12.065 --> 03:14.232
- Long time, no see, Kate.

03:15.117 --> 03:17.034
Fuckin' not ideal.

03:18.189 --> 03:19.356
Come on, Kate.

03:20.788 --> 03:21.621
Kate?

03:22.992 --> 03:24.217
(monkeys screeching)

03:24.217 --> 03:25.050
Kate?

03:27.198 --> 03:28.031
Kate?

03:34.549 --> 03:36.111
- What are you doing here, Lee?

03:36.111 --> 03:38.528
- [Lee] Look, I-I-I know, I uh...

03:40.146 --> 03:42.275
LA has shit public transportation.

03:42.275 --> 03:44.429
But you'd be surprised where
six public buses and one

03:44.429 --> 03:47.403
shifty Mexican fa--
- Don't be cute.

03:47.403 --> 03:48.728
- [Lee] I can't help it, it's inherent.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.152
- Oh!

03:50.152 --> 03:53.151
It's been three years, not five!

03:53.151 --> 03:55.140
- [Lee] I'm sensing a little
more anger than excitement--

03:55.140 --> 03:56.855
- Stop being cute.

03:56.855 --> 03:59.225
- I got out early on good behavior, okay?

03:59.225 --> 04:01.487
Kate, Kate, I'm not a fucking psychopath.

04:01.487 --> 04:02.738
- You sure?

04:02.738 --> 04:06.732
Because a psychopath would
do something like, like,

04:06.732 --> 04:08.161
like show up at my house without giving me

04:08.161 --> 04:09.162
a fucking heads up!

04:09.162 --> 04:11.333
Why would you think that's okay?

04:11.333 --> 04:12.833
- Because it's you.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.920
- Lee, you can't be here.

04:19.632 --> 04:21.550
- Yeah, I know, I know.

04:26.410 --> 04:28.338
Slight problem with that, though.

04:28.338 --> 04:30.457
Uh, see, I may have told
my probation officer

04:30.457 --> 04:33.064
I was staying here, so--
- You did what?

04:33.064 --> 04:34.854
- Kate, look, I feel your concern, okay?

04:34.854 --> 04:37.233
Look, I, I really do, just,

04:37.233 --> 04:38.117
just hear me out -
(Kate groaning loudly)

04:38.117 --> 04:39.095
When I was riding on those six

04:39.095 --> 04:42.343
public buses and - and one
shifty Mexican farm truck,

04:42.343 --> 04:43.176
you know what I was -

04:43.176 --> 04:44.884
(pepper spray spraying)
Fuck!

04:44.884 --> 04:46.250
(Lee groaning)

04:46.845 --> 04:48.870
Fuck, Kate!

04:48.870 --> 04:49.703
- Oh, shit.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.303
(Lee breathing heavily)

05:01.269 --> 05:04.127
- So, you seeing anybody?

05:04.786 --> 05:06.536
- Well, that's blunt.

05:07.593 --> 05:09.584
No, not really.

05:09.584 --> 05:11.935
- Bit of a dry spell then, eh?

05:11.935 --> 05:14.600
That's all right, same here.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.282
- Oh, you didn't couple up in prison?

05:16.282 --> 05:17.643
Isn't that how tight little white boys

05:17.643 --> 05:19.731
like you survive in there?

05:19.731 --> 05:21.193
- Well, that's blunt.

05:21.193 --> 05:24.278
- No, did anyone fuck
you in the ass is blunt.

05:24.278 --> 05:28.723
- Yeah, yeah, I guess that's
a bit more blunt, sure.

05:28.723 --> 05:31.120
- So, did anyone fuck you in the ass?

05:31.120 --> 05:33.548
- Oh, of course, yeah.

05:33.548 --> 05:35.465
Only uh... only twice though.

05:39.169 --> 05:41.517
Oh come on, I'm not dumb, Kate.

05:41.517 --> 05:45.817
I uh... I joined the white
supremacists first thing,

05:46.425 --> 05:47.979
right when I got in there.

05:47.979 --> 05:49.773
- Well, I hear their health
benefits are just top notch.

05:49.773 --> 05:53.596
- Uh huh, yeah, and they
are gonna hook me up

05:53.596 --> 05:56.007
with a sweet gig as uh...

05:56.007 --> 05:58.745
some sort of rally organizer I guess.

05:58.745 --> 06:02.604
A little uh... a little
hazy on the details

06:02.604 --> 06:04.354
at the moment though.

06:07.842 --> 06:08.675
And uh...

06:10.780 --> 06:12.030
What about you?

06:13.013 --> 06:15.621
What's uh... What's Ms. Kate Caldwell

06:15.621 --> 06:17.146
doing in the Valley now, huh?

06:17.525 --> 06:18.525
You like it?

06:20.336 --> 06:22.753
- I'm an account manager
for a marketing company.

06:22.753 --> 06:23.586
So, yeah.

06:23.586 --> 06:24.881
- The fuck does that mean?

06:24.881 --> 06:27.032
- I take rich white men to dinner.

06:27.032 --> 06:29.426
- Holy shit, what happened?

06:29.426 --> 06:34.009
I mean, you used to be
overwhelmed by houses like this.

06:34.910 --> 06:37.013
- It's not exactly a mansion.

06:37.013 --> 06:39.096
- Certainly no Calabasas.

06:41.130 --> 06:42.869
- My mom downsized after dad died,

06:42.869 --> 06:45.286
and now I'm downsizing again.

06:48.552 --> 06:49.885
- Shit, I, uh...

06:52.354 --> 06:54.740
I'm sorry about your mom.

06:54.740 --> 06:55.990
- You're not, but thanks.

06:55.990 --> 06:57.481
(Lee chuckling)

06:58.208 --> 07:01.375
- You still see right through me, huh?

07:03.125 --> 07:04.628
I tried though, huh?

07:04.628 --> 07:06.211
You see that, Kate?

07:06.211 --> 07:08.759
That was that was acting right there,

07:08.759 --> 07:13.759
yeah, I did a few stage plays
in uh... in uh, in jail.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.937
- Oh, so you're an actor
as well as a musician now?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.700
Impressive.
- Oh, yeah.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.685
Played Juliet in fact, yeah.

07:21.685 --> 07:24.518
Really uh, pulled from my experiences.

07:25.485 --> 07:30.476
You know, with the whole
tragic love story thing?

07:32.965 --> 07:34.834
(grimacing)

07:34.834 --> 07:37.084
- Lee, you can't stay here.

07:38.010 --> 07:39.485
- What are you, your fuckin' sister now?

07:39.485 --> 07:40.737
- Do you think Sandra would be as calm as

07:40.737 --> 07:42.569
I am right now?

07:43.844 --> 07:44.677
- Nope.

07:45.043 --> 07:49.069
But, I doubt she'd pepper spray me though.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.261
Speaking of, how is uh Sandra?

07:53.584 --> 07:56.806
- The same, only pregnant,
married to a square, John.

07:56.806 --> 07:58.764
- Wow, she certainly doesn't disappoint.

07:58.764 --> 08:01.264
- You're changing the subject.

08:08.277 --> 08:10.860
- I don't have anyone, but you.

08:14.284 --> 08:16.784
- Did you just quote Iron Man?

08:20.051 --> 08:23.417
- It was the only DVD they had in the pen.

08:23.417 --> 08:26.750
I pretty much memorized the whole thing.

08:28.637 --> 08:30.005
- I'm gonna regret this.

08:30.005 --> 08:32.755
Uh, you can sleep here one night.

08:33.803 --> 08:35.402
You got it?

08:35.402 --> 08:36.846
And you sleep on the
couch, you got that too?

08:36.846 --> 08:37.991
- Yeah, got it.

08:37.991 --> 08:39.870
Look, I'm a...

08:39.870 --> 08:40.979
I'm gonna be like a mouse, Kate.

08:40.979 --> 08:41.837
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.837 --> 08:43.765
- Like a fuckin', like a sleepy ninja.

08:43.765 --> 08:47.683
Yeah, I'm gonna be the
quietest house guest

08:49.303 --> 08:50.328
you have ever seen.

08:50.328 --> 08:52.079
- Yeah, that's what my last
Airbnb tenant said before

08:52.079 --> 08:53.162
I booted her.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.751
- What's a...

08:55.751 --> 08:57.259
What's an Airbnb?

08:57.259 --> 08:58.789
- You might have missed a few
things while you were away.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.972
Uh, shower's here.

09:02.133 --> 09:02.966
Don't drop the soap.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.132
(birds chirping)

09:16.361 --> 09:19.010
Alexis, turn off nature sounds.

09:19.010 --> 09:19.927
- The fuck?

09:20.891 --> 09:23.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa, haven't you seen 2001?

09:23.516 --> 09:24.683
Or Terminator?

09:25.531 --> 09:27.438
Oh my God, Tron?

09:27.438 --> 09:28.622
Kate, you can't trust machines.

09:28.622 --> 09:30.024
- [Kate] Okay, John Connor.

09:30.024 --> 09:32.209
Uh, here's some of your old stuff.

09:32.209 --> 09:34.792
I, I figured you might need it.

09:37.836 --> 09:39.586
- Are you kidding me?

09:41.355 --> 09:42.188
Wow, I...

09:43.691 --> 09:46.764
I thought you would have
thrown this out by now.

09:46.764 --> 09:49.264
- I would have, I just forgot.

09:52.323 --> 09:54.823
Uh, so I made your bed, there.

09:56.050 --> 09:57.717
- Oh thanks, thanks.

09:59.694 --> 10:03.059
Hey, hey do you have anything to drink?

10:03.059 --> 10:05.062
You know, I was thinking

10:05.062 --> 10:07.249
I was thinking maybe we
could crack open a few beers?

10:07.249 --> 10:10.147
You know, reminisce
about the good old days?

10:10.147 --> 10:11.222
What do you say?

10:11.222 --> 10:12.972
- Uh... no, I don't, sorry.

10:14.111 --> 10:15.278
- Right, yeah.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.801
Uh, night, Kate.

10:17.801 --> 10:18.884
- Night, Lee.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.120
- Why didn't you come see me?

10:30.024 --> 10:32.405
When I was away, why...

10:32.405 --> 10:34.155
why didn't you visit?

10:36.483 --> 10:38.208
- Because you're bad for me, Lee.

10:51.632 --> 10:53.873
(insects chirping)

10:58.174 --> 11:01.424
(playful guitar music)

11:01.574 --> 11:03.032
(sighing)

11:11.207 --> 11:14.057
(breathing heavily)

11:27.768 --> 11:29.809
(panting)

11:33.642 --> 11:34.475
(fridge door opening)

11:36.884 --> 11:38.392
- Oh my God.

11:45.367 --> 11:47.317
(stove clicking)

11:59.274 --> 12:01.441
- Yeah, just like a ninja.

12:14.444 --> 12:15.604
- How old are these?

12:15.604 --> 12:17.996
- Mmm, I already regret
letting you stay here tonight.

12:17.996 --> 12:18.829
Don't push it.

12:18.829 --> 12:20.862
- You said I could sleep here one night.

12:20.862 --> 12:22.198
I mean I haven't slept at all tonight.

12:22.198 --> 12:25.286
So for tomorrow night, I
would love it if we could

12:25.286 --> 12:26.948
pick up some butterscotch pudding.

12:26.948 --> 12:27.831
- Mmm.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.693
- I know, it's kind of
old school, but uh...

12:30.693 --> 12:32.650
they didn't have any in the
pen and fuck me if I didn't

12:32.650 --> 12:33.693
miss it by the end.

12:33.693 --> 12:36.753
- No, no, no, that was not the deal.

12:36.753 --> 12:38.889
- [Lee] Ah, it's in the details, Kate.

12:38.889 --> 12:40.812
- Oh, I remember the details.

12:40.812 --> 12:42.719
- You don't remember anything.

12:42.719 --> 12:46.094
- I remember how uh...
you always used to wake up

12:46.094 --> 12:49.431
in the middle of the
night, looking for snacks.

12:49.431 --> 12:53.103
And because of that, how
I thought our apartment

12:53.103 --> 12:55.434
had mice the whole first
month we lived together.

12:55.434 --> 12:56.751
- Mm-hmm, and do you
remember what happened

12:56.751 --> 12:58.468
when we actually did have mice?

12:58.468 --> 12:59.785
- We had mice?

12:59.785 --> 13:01.335
(Lee laughing)

13:01.468 --> 13:02.818
(Kate laughing)

13:04.872 --> 13:09.582
- Plus, I don't recall you
hating my snack raids back then.

13:09.582 --> 13:12.544
- Yeah, 'cause you'd
come in like some sort

13:12.544 --> 13:15.684
of snack genie and wake me
up with a little tiny egg

13:15.684 --> 13:17.938
and cheese burrito every night.

13:17.938 --> 13:19.605
Who would hate that?

13:27.441 --> 13:29.691
I'm not hungry, but thanks.

13:44.444 --> 13:45.277
- I, uh...

13:48.034 --> 13:51.034
I also remember

13:52.243 --> 13:55.576
what used to happen after I woke you up.

13:59.207 --> 14:03.976
- Yeah, we didn't get a lot
of sleep back then, did we?

14:03.976 --> 14:04.809
- Uh.

14:06.785 --> 14:07.618
No.

14:10.786 --> 14:12.036
No, we did not.

14:20.967 --> 14:23.634
(upbeat guitar music)

14:33.072 --> 14:36.814
(moaning)

15:01.940 --> 15:03.990
(doorbell rings)

15:03.998 --> 15:05.782
(knocking)

15:05.790 --> 15:06.749
- Fuck.

15:08.591 --> 15:09.424
- Kate!

15:11.152 --> 15:12.403
Kate!

15:12.403 --> 15:15.620
You better be ready to
pack, or so help me God!

15:17.414 --> 15:19.706
Screw it, I'm coming in, Kate.

15:19.706 --> 15:21.681
Okay, here is the plan.

15:21.681 --> 15:24.381
I'm gonna pack up the kitchen; Utensils,

15:24.381 --> 15:27.810
appliances, et cetera, and
you are gonna bring the boxes

15:27.810 --> 15:30.311
into the garage because A, I'm pregnant,

15:30.311 --> 15:32.895
and B, I'm pregnant.

15:34.591 --> 15:36.537
Of course you're not ready.

15:36.537 --> 15:40.520
Oh, and look, you didn't pack
anything last night either.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.772
Fantastic!

15:41.772 --> 15:42.888
- Mm, good morning, Sandra.

15:42.888 --> 15:43.721
- Is it?

15:45.486 --> 15:46.653
- Oh, fuck me!

15:47.231 --> 15:49.666
- Because I woke up,
like I do every day now,

15:49.666 --> 15:52.362
and vomited a literal quart
size into a convenient

15:52.362 --> 15:55.096
bucket that's next to my bed
due to the fact that I can't

15:55.096 --> 15:57.538
make it to the bathroom anymore.

15:57.538 --> 15:59.938
By the way, ants, Kate.

16:01.107 --> 16:04.473
Then, I spent 35 minutes

16:04.590 --> 16:06.331
35 minutes, Kate,

16:06.337 --> 16:08.015
in our local kosher bakery just,

16:08.015 --> 16:10.716
just inhaling because I can't
eat chocolate right now.

16:10.716 --> 16:12.411
- For the record, you
can eat chocolate cake,

16:12.411 --> 16:13.354
you just choose not to.

16:13.354 --> 16:14.597
- [Sandra] No, chocolate has caffeine,

16:14.597 --> 16:15.447
which is bad for the baby.

16:15.447 --> 16:16.280
- There's such a thing as moderation.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.823
- And then, I come here to
find my ever prompt sister

16:20.173 --> 16:22.852
not at all ready for a
pre-arranged day of packing,

16:22.852 --> 16:26.060
one of which I took a
personal day off of work for,

16:26.060 --> 16:28.887
and I only get five of those.

16:29.862 --> 16:31.068
- Oh, no.

16:31.068 --> 16:32.991
- [Sandra] Yes, Kate, only five.

16:32.991 --> 16:34.992
- [Lee] When an elephant
returns to its herd after

16:34.992 --> 16:38.418
being absent for a long
time, the herd will scream,

16:38.418 --> 16:41.751
urinate, and defecate in celebration.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.907
Ah, it's still better
than pepper spray, though.

16:44.382 --> 16:45.719
- You know what?

16:45.719 --> 16:47.528
The plan is the same.

16:47.528 --> 16:51.985
I'll pack the kitchen,
you lift boxes, okay?

16:51.985 --> 16:54.392
- Can you believe they didn't
have Boston creme, huh?

16:54.392 --> 16:56.182
W-what sort of Turkish-owned,

16:56.182 --> 16:58.938
Latino-fuckin'-operated,
Jewish bakery doesn't have

16:58.938 --> 17:00.355
an Irish class...

17:02.906 --> 17:04.323
Hey, Sandra.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.273
You are looking lovely
for a pregnant lass.

17:10.277 --> 17:12.736
Uh, to be honest, I didn't
know you'd be joining us,

17:12.736 --> 17:14.615
so I didn't get you a
coffee, I'm, I'm sorry,

17:14.615 --> 17:16.300
but you know what?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.800
You can have mine.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.878
A-actually, I hear caffeine
is bad for babies anyways,

17:21.878 --> 17:24.128
so I'll just keep it, okay?

17:26.913 --> 17:28.746
Mmm, it's pretty good.

17:38.025 --> 17:39.399
- What the fuck?

17:39.399 --> 17:40.640
(soft guitar music)

17:42.340 --> 17:43.173
(lighter clicking)

17:51.112 --> 17:52.237
- Nice to see you too, by the way.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.584
- Shut the fuck up, Lee.

17:53.584 --> 17:54.417
- Got it.

17:58.781 --> 18:01.580
So, Sandra, I hear uh... you
know I hear you're married

18:01.580 --> 18:02.883
to a square now, how's that?

18:02.883 --> 18:05.633
- So, you're fucking him already?

18:07.416 --> 18:09.225
Oh my God, you are fucking him already!

18:09.225 --> 18:10.392
Kate, come on!

18:12.102 --> 18:13.336
- Good luck.

18:13.961 --> 18:16.632
- What are you thinking, Kate?

18:16.632 --> 18:19.261
What the fuck are you thinking?

18:19.261 --> 18:21.931
- I told him he could stay
here for one night, Sandra.

18:21.931 --> 18:23.326
He-he needed a place to sleep,

18:23.326 --> 18:24.642
what was I supposed to do?

18:24.642 --> 18:26.370
- Fucking pepper spray him.

18:26.370 --> 18:27.233
- I fucking did!

18:27.233 --> 18:28.396
- You did what?

18:28.396 --> 18:29.593
- Hey, Sandra?

18:29.593 --> 18:31.376
- Lee, shut up, and stop blowing smoke

18:31.376 --> 18:32.679
into my dead mother's house!

18:32.679 --> 18:34.340
- Shit, yeah I'm real sorry about that.

18:34.340 --> 18:35.878
- Yeah, no you're not, Lee.

18:35.878 --> 18:36.711
- Fair enough.

18:36.711 --> 18:40.544
Uh, you know, since
you're pregnant and sober,

18:41.674 --> 18:44.949
yeah, I'm uh... I'm gonna need your piss.

18:44.949 --> 18:48.959
Only for three to six
months though, you know?

18:48.959 --> 18:51.724
Probation and what not, you know?

18:51.724 --> 18:53.673
- You know he's gonna end up
back in prison in less than

18:53.673 --> 18:54.780
a year, right?

18:54.780 --> 18:56.966
- That might be a bit optimistic.

18:56.966 --> 18:57.799
- Listen.

18:58.731 --> 19:01.388
You can't make this work.

19:01.388 --> 19:02.368
Okay?

19:02.368 --> 19:05.219
I know, I know you think
you can, but you can't.

19:05.219 --> 19:06.250
- Oh, I can make this work.

19:06.250 --> 19:07.683
- No, that's not what I said, I--

19:07.683 --> 19:09.184
- [Kate] You literally just said that.

19:09.184 --> 19:11.147
- I didn't say you can't
make this work, I said,

19:11.147 --> 19:13.026
you can't make this work.

19:13.026 --> 19:13.859
There is a difference.

19:13.859 --> 19:14.732
- Okay, you know what, Sandra?

19:14.732 --> 19:15.938
Stop playing mom here for a hot second,

19:16.146 --> 19:18.273
and let me worry about what
I can and can't do, okay?

19:18.273 --> 19:19.220
Hey, Lee.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.053
- Yeah?

19:20.053 --> 19:23.607
- You can stay here until
you find a permanent place.

19:23.607 --> 19:24.774
- Hey, Sandra.

19:25.877 --> 19:28.795
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.

19:28.795 --> 19:31.295
The humdrum-vee is back there.

(exhaling loudly)

21:25.240 --> 21:27.576
- [Lee] Elephants can use
their trunks to paint.

21:27.576 --> 21:29.427
And they obviously love it.

21:29.427 --> 21:31.969
Also, when they get tired
of holding their trunks up,

21:31.969 --> 21:34.496
they rest them on their tusks.

Fucking adorable.

Oh!

21:49.819 --> 21:51.348
What is this stuff doing here, huh?

21:54.821 --> 21:58.194
Oh my God, look at the, you've
ruined the paintbrushes.

21:58.194 --> 21:59.027
Why?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.857
- I don't know, I
haven't painted in years.

22:00.857 --> 22:01.692
- Why?

22:01.692 --> 22:02.860
You're amazing, Kate.

22:02.860 --> 22:04.254
Huh, why did you stop painting?

22:04.254 --> 22:06.622
Actually, you know,
elephants can paint too?

22:06.622 --> 22:07.851
- So I've heard.

22:07.851 --> 22:08.707
- Oh yeah?

22:08.707 --> 22:11.836
- I don't know, I just lost
interest I guess, I dunno.

22:11.836 --> 22:13.576
- Well that's a terrible answer.

22:13.576 --> 22:14.409
- Mm-hmm.

22:14.409 --> 22:16.431
- I mean as far as answers,
that's probably fucking

22:16.431 --> 22:20.694

You've been ignoring my calls.

22:30.841 --> 22:31.750
What's going on?

22:31.750 --> 22:32.583

22:35.654 --> 22:36.487

22:36.487 --> 22:37.504

22:41.111 --> 22:42.134

No, I don't, I just I'll

22:46.907 --> 22:48.574

23:05.087 --> 23:06.187
- Yeah.

23:06.187 --> 23:09.462
- I made dinner reservations for tonight.

23:09.462 --> 23:10.735
I'm feeling Thai.

23:10.735 --> 23:13.595
- You mean like, go out
kind of dinner reservations?

23:13.595 --> 23:14.428
- Uh... Yeah?

23:16.016 --> 23:16.849
- Mm-hmm.

23:16.849 --> 23:18.268
- Are you okay?

23:18.268 --> 23:19.690
- Yeah, it's fine.

23:19.690 --> 23:20.811
- Okay.

23:20.811 --> 23:21.644
Ow.

23:22.983 --> 23:24.694
I'll see you later.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.588
Pick that up.

23:26.588 --> 23:27.421
- Okay.

23:31.324 --> 23:33.907
("Dark Winter Nights"
by The Roamin' Jasmine)

23:37.922 --> 23:38.755
Wow.

23:40.308 --> 23:41.808
- What's going on?

23:42.917 --> 23:46.922
- Well, I uh... I know you
made reservations, but,

23:46.922 --> 23:50.199
you know, I was thinking this
could be kind of romantic.

23:50.199 --> 23:52.474
Plus, I got Thai food.

23:54.756 --> 23:57.339
- I said I haven't painted in--

23:57.743 --> 23:59.210
- Okay, no, time out, time out, Kate.

23:59.210 --> 24:01.691
Look, look, I became a bit
of Monet when I was in jail.

24:01.691 --> 24:05.731
Okay, so this is just me being selfish.

24:05.731 --> 24:07.231
Please, after you.

24:10.564 --> 24:13.743
- You sure did develop a
lot of hobbies in prison.

24:13.743 --> 24:14.602
- Skills, Kate.

24:14.602 --> 24:16.410
Not hobbies, skills.

24:16.410 --> 24:19.748
One of which I'm gonna show you now.

24:19.748 --> 24:20.581
You ready?

24:21.490 --> 24:22.323
- Maybe.

24:23.542 --> 24:24.560
This is going to be terrible,

24:24.560 --> 24:27.007
just so we're both clear on this, right?

25:43.183 --> 25:44.457
- It's not called painter training.

25:44.457 --> 25:47.376

28:48.013 --> 28:48.935

28:48.935 --> 28:50.399

28:50.399 --> 28:51.538

28:51.538 --> 28:54.879
- Well, you are gonna love it, okay?

28:54.879 --> 28:55.712
- Ugh!

28:55.712 --> 28:57.387
- Mmm, oh!

28:57.479 --> 28:58.704
Mmm!

28:58.704 --> 29:00.068
Okay, you might not hate it.

29:00.068 --> 29:02.901
- I am absolutely not eating that.

29:04.165 --> 29:05.398
Ugh.

29:05.398 --> 29:09.705
Come on, we should, we should
go for a hike or something.

29:09.705 --> 29:12.273
We'll make fun of people at Runyon.

29:12.273 --> 29:14.923
I'll even be extra
Hollywood and buy us juice.

29:14.923 --> 29:16.555
- I think I'm okay, Kate.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.158
I didn't really get into
hiking when I was in jail.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.594
- Not one of your new skills?

29:20.594 --> 29:22.539
- The hills were a bit too small there.

29:22.539 --> 29:24.807
(laughing)

29:24.807 --> 29:25.926
- Well, come on.

29:25.926 --> 29:28.060
We should get out of the house.

29:28.060 --> 29:29.592
It'll be good for you.

29:29.592 --> 29:31.675
- I don't wanna go, okay?

29:34.356 --> 29:36.161
- I'll be with you, it's fine.

29:36.161 --> 29:37.390
- Kate, I'm not going.

29:37.390 --> 29:39.022
What are you, deaf?

29:39.022 --> 29:40.817
- Uh... Lee, I heard you.

29:40.817 --> 29:43.596
I-I-I just think you're being stubborn.

29:43.596 --> 29:46.545
- Kate, I'm not fucking going.

29:46.545 --> 29:49.517
- Lee.
- Kate, I'm not fucking going!

29:49.517 --> 29:50.877
- What is your problem?

29:50.877 --> 29:51.867
- What is my problem?

29:51.867 --> 29:53.454
Y-you're trying to shove
some dumbass hiking trip

29:53.454 --> 29:55.039
down my throat when I already told you,

29:55.039 --> 29:58.443
very politely, that I'm not
interested in going, okay?

29:58.443 --> 29:59.474
Thanks for breakfast.

29:59.474 --> 30:03.240
- Holy shit, okay, you
need to calm down, okay?

30:03.240 --> 30:04.240
Fucking wow.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.882
When was the last time you decompressed?

30:07.882 --> 30:08.985
Fuck.

30:08.985 --> 30:11.693
- Oh, I don't know three years ago?

30:13.527 --> 30:15.143
(Lee coughing)

30:15.173 --> 30:18.297
This weed is so stale. (coughs)

30:18.297 --> 30:19.821
- Yeah, I haven't really
smoked in a while either.

30:19.821 --> 30:23.192
- Yeah, I'm definitely gonna
need your sister's piss now.

30:23.192 --> 30:27.442
(laughing)
No, I'm fuckin' serious.

30:34.818 --> 30:36.318
- I've missed you.

30:39.958 --> 30:42.375
- Why didn't you come see me?

30:43.385 --> 30:44.382
- I told you--
- Kate, Kate,

30:44.382 --> 30:46.772
that was a cop-out, okay? That was a...

30:46.772 --> 30:49.029
That was a fuckin' Hallmark card, okay?

30:49.029 --> 30:51.446
That was, uh--
- Because I...

30:53.308 --> 30:57.246
I was afraid I'd waste my
life waiting for you, and,

30:57.246 --> 31:00.065
I knew if I came to see you, even once,

31:00.065 --> 31:02.460
that's exactly what I'd do.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.960
- You never even called, Kate.

31:07.241 --> 31:09.742
For the first few months, I
thought we were still dating.

31:09.742 --> 31:13.742
And that maybe, that maybe
you were just pissed.

31:15.119 --> 31:18.370
And then I started to
buy into this conspiracy

31:18.370 --> 31:21.636
that this warden had it out
for me and was stopping me from

31:21.636 --> 31:24.053
contacting the outside world.

31:26.670 --> 31:28.962
- When'd you figure it out?

31:28.962 --> 31:31.919
- My mother called me, asking for money.

31:31.919 --> 31:36.845
So I told her I was away and
working for 93 cents a day.

31:36.845 --> 31:38.928
- What'd she say to that?

31:40.253 --> 31:42.024
- "I'll take what I can get."

31:42.024 --> 31:44.274
(laughing)

31:44.821 --> 31:46.201
Oh my God,

31:46.201 --> 31:47.814
you're laughing at my
drug-addicted mother?

31:47.814 --> 31:48.647
- I swear, I'm not.

31:48.647 --> 31:50.706
I'm not.
- [Lee] Wow, Kate, wow!

31:50.706 --> 31:52.417
Wow, it shows how much
you know a person, huh?

31:52.417 --> 31:54.167
- Seriously, I'm not.

31:59.103 --> 32:00.436
I went to rehab.

32:02.859 --> 32:04.109
After you left.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.175
For alcohol, mostly.

32:26.847 --> 32:28.527
It was the only way I could stop myself

32:28.527 --> 32:30.444
from coming to see you.

32:36.537 --> 32:41.120
It seemed like a good idea,
until, you know, it wasn't.

32:59.809 --> 33:03.726
Lee, what I said before,
that wasn't a cop-out.

33:04.728 --> 33:06.228
You're bad for me.

33:09.564 --> 33:11.887
It's definitely a dog.
- This one?

33:11.887 --> 33:12.720
- Yes.

33:15.570 --> 33:17.128
- Okay.

33:17.128 --> 33:18.515
- Oh my God!
- What?

33:18.515 --> 33:19.996
- We should get a dog!

33:19.996 --> 33:20.834
- Fuck yeah!

33:20.834 --> 33:22.000
- We should get a dog.
- Really?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.291
- Yes.
- I want a dog so bad.

33:24.291 --> 33:26.199
- And we shall name him--

33:26.199 --> 33:29.808
- Murphy, I wanna call him Murphy.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.193
- Yeah, but maybe--

33:31.193 --> 33:33.099
- Maybe not that name though.
- Yeah, it's a good name.

33:33.099 --> 33:33.932
- Why?

33:36.297 --> 33:39.297
Okay, we can call it something else.

33:43.946 --> 33:46.657
- It looks like a taco, it
doesn't really look like

33:46.657 --> 33:47.719
a dog anymore.

35:14.859 --> 35:16.869

35:16.869 --> 35:18.112
- I don't need money, Sandra.

35:18.112 --> 35:19.702
- Hey, I don't recall you complaining

35:19.702 --> 35:21.407
when dad used to put money
in your account every month.

35:21.407 --> 35:23.578
It's just, you know, did Lee ever wonder

35:23.578 --> 35:25.203
how you two paid rent?

35:25.203 --> 35:27.047
- I told him I sold my
body on the streets.

35:28.371 --> 35:30.455

35:30.455 --> 35:32.784
I don't even like to see John that much.

35:32.784 --> 35:33.999
- Well that sounds like
a personal problem.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.100
- This isn't a joke, Kate.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.946
This is exactly what happened last time.

35:36.946 --> 35:39.618
Lee Riley came along, and poof,

35:40.921 --> 35:42.995
Actually, Peggy called me the other day

35:42.995 --> 35:44.236
to ask where you've been lately.

35:44.236 --> 35:45.456
- Oh, Peggy's a prude.

35:45.456 --> 35:46.289
- Kate!

35:46.289 --> 35:47.692
- I bet her and John would get along.

35:47.692 --> 35:48.683
Maybe if she's bored, they can hang out.

35:48.683 --> 35:49.635
- You know what?

35:49.635 --> 35:51.083
Do you want me to have a miscarriage?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.114
Is that what you want?

35:52.114 --> 35:53.441
'Cause that's what I think you want.

35:53.441 --> 35:55.222
- No, but if you want one,
I can refer you to a few

35:55.222 --> 35:56.571
places that could help you out with that.

35:56.571 --> 36:00.100
- I sincerely hope you're joking.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.433
So, everything's great then?

36:04.069 --> 36:06.436
Lee's a changed man?

36:06.997 --> 36:09.959
You're back to not wearing a
bra, like it's fucking 2014?

36:09.959 --> 36:10.896
Fantastic, Kate.

36:10.896 --> 36:12.734
- I am not gonna end up in rehab again,

36:12.734 --> 36:14.733
if that's what you're thinking.

36:14.733 --> 36:16.750
- So you're still sober?

36:16.750 --> 36:17.908
- Of course.

36:17.908 --> 36:21.162
- And you don't need those
silly little AA meetings, right?

36:21.162 --> 36:22.758
That's why you haven't been going?

36:22.758 --> 36:24.886
- You shouldn't spy on people, thank you.

36:24.886 --> 36:26.859
- Well, two weeks ago, you
would have had that house

36:26.859 --> 36:28.433
packed no problem, Kate.

36:28.433 --> 36:29.813
- Okay, I will get the house packed.

36:29.813 --> 36:30.978
Would you calm down?

36:30.978 --> 36:32.484
Besides.

36:32.484 --> 36:33.725
I don't know, it's not like it used to be.

36:33.725 --> 36:37.163
Lee and I are, we're good,
we're better than good.

36:37.163 --> 36:38.830
We're communicating.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.041
- You're communicating?
- Mm-hmm.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.678
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:44.678 --> 36:45.595
- Prove it.

36:46.645 --> 36:49.609
I am having my boss over
for dinner tomorrow,

36:49.609 --> 36:53.279
and he has specifically asked to meet you.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.446
So!
- Okay.

36:55.318 --> 36:59.793
- [Sandra] Bring Lee and
we will see how he does.

37:00.548 --> 37:01.381
- Mm-hmm.

37:03.342 --> 37:04.820
- Is he gonna have a problem with that?

37:04.820 --> 37:05.971
- [Kate] No, not at all.

37:05.971 --> 37:07.061
- No?
- Mm-mmm.

37:07.061 --> 37:08.978
- Okay, good.
- Mm-hmm.

37:09.829 --> 37:11.812
- Oh God.
- Tomorrow.

37:11.812 --> 37:12.831
8:00 p.m.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.173
Don't be late, please.

37:15.173 --> 37:16.006
- I won't.

37:16.006 --> 37:16.839
- Okay.

37:16.839 --> 37:18.084
I'll see you then.

37:18.084 --> 37:20.277
And don't forget to wear a bra, Kate!

37:20.277 --> 37:22.777
- I'll wear a bra.
- Love you!

Meet Murphy.

He kind of he kinda looks
a little like Sandra, no?

37:53.308 --> 37:54.465

37:54.465 --> 37:56.021
- I told you, it's Murphy.

37:56.021 --> 37:57.587
- Please tell me you didn't buy a dog.

37:57.587 --> 37:58.992
- Well, I didn't. I
don't have a credit card.

37:58.992 --> 38:00.192
- Why the fuck would you buy a dog?

38:00.192 --> 38:02.222
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, I uh, I
thought we were on the same

38:02.222 --> 38:03.336
page here, come on.

38:03.336 --> 38:05.210
I distinctly remember you saying,

38:05.210 --> 38:06.043
"We should get a dog."

38:06.043 --> 38:08.198
- I was high out of my fucking mind.

38:08.198 --> 38:10.526
Why the fuck would you
just go and buy a dog?

38:10.526 --> 38:12.062
Oh my God, Lee!

38:12.062 --> 38:13.648
I have a job, okay?

38:13.648 --> 38:15.419
Who's gonna walk it?

38:15.419 --> 38:16.902
I don't know how to take
care of something like that!

38:16.902 --> 38:18.582
It's gonna, it's gonna fuckin' die, Lee!

38:18.582 --> 38:19.725
It's gonna fuckin' die!

38:19.725 --> 38:21.325
Look, can't you fuckin' return it?

38:21.325 --> 38:25.908
- He came from a kill shelter,
so I mean, that depends.

38:28.107 --> 38:31.059
- I can't deal with this right now.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.669
I cannot deal with this.

38:32.669 --> 38:33.752
- [Lee] Kate!

38:35.263 --> 38:39.513
- By the way, there's dog
shit in the fucking hall.

38:41.104 --> 38:43.937
You should come pick this shit up!

38:46.820 --> 38:47.921
- Slow.

38:47.921 --> 38:48.754
Slow.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.248
Slow, good boy.

38:51.248 --> 38:53.296
Oh, who's a good boy?

38:53.296 --> 38:56.814
Come on, slow, sit aw,
you eat so much, Murphy.

38:56.814 --> 38:59.293
- I'm sorry that I freaked
out about the dog earlier.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.007
- It's okay, don't worry
about it, it's fine.

39:01.007 --> 39:02.461
- Murphy's actually kinda cute, I guess.

39:02.461 --> 39:03.336
- Oh yeah?

39:03.336 --> 39:04.752
Well, he told me the same thing
about you, funnily enough.

39:04.752 --> 39:07.000
(laughing)

39:07.000 --> 39:08.180
Innit, Murph?

39:08.180 --> 39:11.345
Aw, good boy, good boy, gimme your paw.

39:11.345 --> 39:12.722
Oh, man.

39:12.722 --> 39:13.908
You know what, Kate?

39:13.908 --> 39:15.686
I can't believe how much
junk you've accumulated over

39:15.686 --> 39:17.238
the past three years.

39:17.238 --> 39:19.731
I mean, you used to just
have one pair of old combat

39:19.731 --> 39:23.128
boots you wore with every
single outfit; Dress, jeans,

39:23.128 --> 39:25.069
sweatpants, didn't matter.

39:25.069 --> 39:26.369
Combat boots.

39:26.369 --> 39:27.440
- It's not all mine.

39:27.440 --> 39:28.464
You knew my mother.

39:28.464 --> 39:29.972
She was a bit overindulgent.

39:29.972 --> 39:34.789
- [Lee] Understatement of
the century right there.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.375
- [Kate] Oh.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.995
- [Lee] Oh my God, no way.

39:37.995 --> 39:38.828
- Oh, God.

39:38.828 --> 39:40.504
- Fuck, Stewie Caldwell!

39:40.504 --> 39:42.125
- He despised that name.

39:42.125 --> 39:43.845
Sandra still thinks you
caused his heart attack.

39:43.845 --> 39:45.284
- Hey, hey, look, I was
already locked up when he

39:45.284 --> 39:46.379
kicked the bucket, okay?

39:46.379 --> 39:47.729
So, not my fault.

39:47.729 --> 39:48.963
- Very true.

39:48.963 --> 39:50.842
But mom told us after the
fact that he'd have these

39:50.842 --> 39:53.631
cold sweats and he'd wake up
in the middle of the night

39:53.631 --> 39:56.757
with these nightmares that you
actually didn't go to prison.

39:56.757 --> 39:58.141
So there.

39:58.141 --> 40:00.302
- Okay, well, for all the
worrying your dad did,

40:00.302 --> 40:02.016
mine did the opposite.

40:02.016 --> 40:05.409
That guy didn't care where
I was, who I was fucking,

40:05.409 --> 40:07.300
what I was smoking.

40:07.300 --> 40:11.030
I mean, he tried, but ah,
maybe he didn't, whatever.

40:11.030 --> 40:14.369
Hopefully I'll be a
better father than he was.

40:14.369 --> 40:17.164
- [Kate] I don't think I ever want kids.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.852
I dunno, the thought of ruining
like a real human being--

40:18.852 --> 40:19.706
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:19.706 --> 40:20.722
What are you talking
about, you don't want kids?

40:20.722 --> 40:21.555
You always wanted kids.

40:21.555 --> 40:23.291
- [Kate] I never wanted kids.

40:23.291 --> 40:25.952
- [Lee] Uh... Do I need to
remind you about the mice, Kate?

40:25.952 --> 40:27.384
- [Kate] Do I need to
remind you that girlfriends

40:27.384 --> 40:29.051
are always right?

40:29.051 --> 40:31.264
- [Lee] Oh, so you're my
girlfriend now, are you?

40:31.264 --> 40:33.520
- [Kate] Well, I mean...

40:33.520 --> 40:35.050
I would hope so.

40:35.050 --> 40:37.383
It's been a month, you know?

40:40.529 --> 40:41.362
Too soon?

you're eating that in front

44:11.328 --> 44:12.317

it and not touching it.

44:14.652 --> 44:15.732

like looking at it, John!

- Feet!

44:24.059 --> 44:25.415
So you haven't told Lee?

44:26.273 --> 44:29.104
I will, promise.
(barking)

44:29.104 --> 44:30.566

44:30.566 --> 44:33.690
Oh my God, please tell me
you didn't buy a dog, Kate?

44:33.690 --> 44:35.489

44:41.408 --> 44:44.723
And please, make sure Lee wears a tie.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.289

you fucking kidding me?

44:48.249 --> 44:50.504

a tie, I will come over--

One of us, at least.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.693
- [Sandra] Kate, if you show
up wearing a tie, I will--

45:02.693 --> 45:04.785
- Good morning, Kick-Ass Kate.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.205
- It is, isn't it?

45:06.205 --> 45:07.038
- Hello?

45:11.438 --> 45:12.938
She hung up on me.

45:14.454 --> 45:16.287
- We should get a dog.

45:18.432 --> 45:19.265
- No.

45:20.786 --> 45:22.298
- So--
- Hmm?

45:22.298 --> 45:25.559
- Tonight, I was thinking we
could go for a little drive

45:25.559 --> 45:26.598
into the desert.

45:26.598 --> 45:27.457
- Mm-hmm?

45:27.457 --> 45:29.374
- Look up at the stars,

45:30.210 --> 45:31.963
and smoke some of that stale weed.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.104
- Oh, that sounds perfect.

45:33.104 --> 45:34.309
Except, we have plans.

45:34.309 --> 45:36.066
Sandra's having a dinner
party tonight and she wants

45:36.066 --> 45:37.188
us both to go.

45:37.188 --> 45:38.731
I'm sorry.

45:38.731 --> 45:39.992
- Kate.

45:39.992 --> 45:41.409
Kate, Kate, Kate.

45:42.650 --> 45:45.573
A human being can do
one of two things, okay?

45:45.573 --> 45:49.412
They can have dinner, or they can party.

45:49.412 --> 45:50.411
They can't do both.

45:50.411 --> 45:52.828
- You bought a dog yesterday.

45:56.962 --> 45:58.495
- So?

45:59.674 --> 46:00.652
What time's the dinner party?

46:00.652 --> 46:01.652
- Thank you.

46:03.340 --> 46:05.398
Uh, also, you need to wear a tie.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.173
(foot tapping)

46:09.273 --> 46:12.081
It's just a tie, stop
looking so miserable.

46:12.081 --> 46:15.438
- I didn't even wear a tie to
my own father's funeral, okay?

46:15.438 --> 46:18.621
I mean, that was largely
to spite him, but still.

46:18.621 --> 46:20.021
- Lee, grow up, it's a piece of fabric.

46:20.021 --> 46:21.619
- It ain't me.

46:21.619 --> 46:23.318
- If you don't let me
wrap it around your neck,

46:23.318 --> 46:24.449
I'll choke the shit out of you, okay?

46:24.449 --> 46:27.116
- Hey, Kate, I'm not wearing it.

46:28.903 --> 46:31.040
Still think the combat
boots went with the outfit,

46:31.040 --> 46:32.623
but what do I know?

46:34.921 --> 46:37.209
Not even sure why we
even brought this, 'cause

46:37.209 --> 46:38.540
we don't even drink wine anyways, so--

46:38.540 --> 46:40.093
- When you go to someone's house,

46:40.093 --> 46:41.895
you show up with a bottle of wine.

46:41.895 --> 46:43.077
It's called being an adult.

46:43.077 --> 46:43.910
Get with it.
- Says who?

46:43.910 --> 46:44.743
Who made that rule?

46:44.743 --> 46:45.801
- I dunno, people.

46:45.801 --> 46:48.344
- Bullshit.
(doorbell rings)

46:48.344 --> 46:50.142
Plus I'm pretty sure Sandra's
allergic to red wine,

46:50.142 --> 46:52.392
so uh... well done there.

46:53.762 --> 46:54.783
- Crap.

46:54.783 --> 46:56.967
- Look who's only 30 minutes late.

46:56.967 --> 46:58.134
The lovebirds.

47:00.104 --> 47:03.898
Oh um... you brought uh...
you brought red wine.

47:03.898 --> 47:05.621
Hmm, fantastic.

47:05.621 --> 47:08.378
- Yeah, Lee loves red wine.

47:08.378 --> 47:09.978
He insisted.

47:09.978 --> 47:11.218
- Mm-hmm, okay.

47:11.218 --> 47:12.893
Well, come on.

47:13.948 --> 47:14.929
- Dick.

47:14.929 --> 47:16.124
- Everyone's already
seated, ready for dinner,

47:16.124 --> 47:18.041
so job well done there.

47:19.843 --> 47:21.753
I can't believe you
didn't wear a bra, Kate.

47:21.753 --> 47:23.281
- Oh, I'm wearing one,
it's just real thin.

47:23.281 --> 47:24.114
- Nice.

47:28.312 --> 47:32.176
Kate, I want you to meet
my boss, Chuck Sullivan,

47:32.176 --> 47:36.927
and his very, very beautiful
wife, Cassie Sullivan.

47:36.927 --> 47:38.232
- It's a pleasure, Kate.

47:38.232 --> 47:39.588
I've heard so much about you.

47:39.588 --> 47:40.563
- Hi.

47:40.563 --> 47:41.550
- It's so nice to meet you.

47:41.550 --> 47:42.383
- Hi.

47:42.383 --> 47:43.216
- I'm Lee, what's up?

47:43.216 --> 47:44.049
- Pleasure to meet you, Lee.

47:44.049 --> 47:44.882
- Hi, Lee.

47:44.882 --> 47:45.715
- Hey.

47:45.715 --> 47:47.283
Brought wine.
- Thank you.

47:47.283 --> 47:48.260
- It's the good stuff.

47:48.260 --> 47:49.677
- [Sandra] Great!

47:53.516 --> 47:54.349
- Evening.

47:55.604 --> 47:57.116
Kate, you look lovely tonight.

47:57.116 --> 47:58.356
- Thank you, John.

47:58.356 --> 48:01.325
- [John] Lee, long time no see.

48:01.325 --> 48:02.802
- I'm sorry, we've met before?

48:02.802 --> 48:03.635
- Yeah.

48:04.513 --> 48:06.603
Me and Sandra have been
together about five years

48:06.603 --> 48:07.837
now, so I should think so.

48:07.837 --> 48:08.981
- You sure?

48:08.981 --> 48:10.964
I mean, I because I
think I'd remember a guy

48:10.964 --> 48:13.530
with a British accent.

48:15.472 --> 48:17.618
- Well, you was usually high.

48:17.618 --> 48:19.018
Or drunk.

48:19.018 --> 48:20.385
Sometimes both.

48:20.385 --> 48:22.355
- That's probably true.

48:22.355 --> 48:23.918
- Okay.

48:23.918 --> 48:25.194
Can you put those there?

48:25.194 --> 48:28.363
Thank you everyone for coming,

48:28.363 --> 48:30.283
especially Cassie and Chuck.

48:30.283 --> 48:34.406
Uh, tonight, we will be having
pan-seared chicken breast,

48:34.406 --> 48:38.246
organic, obviously, with a side of wilted

48:38.246 --> 48:42.746
asparagus, also organic, and
John made his very famous

48:44.624 --> 48:47.692
golden mashed potatoes, which of course,

48:47.692 --> 48:49.230
goes without saying that they are--

48:49.230 --> 48:51.235
- Actually, Sandra.

48:51.235 --> 48:52.235
They're not.

48:54.313 --> 48:57.230
- Are you fucking kidding me, John?

48:59.988 --> 49:03.014
- They're organic, everyone.

49:03.014 --> 49:04.327
- (laughs) Jokester!

49:04.327 --> 49:05.785
Bon appetit!

49:05.785 --> 49:08.035
(laughing)

49:08.978 --> 49:11.106
- [Lee] Oh, Sandra, should
you really be throwing

49:11.106 --> 49:12.496
a dinner party in your condition?

49:12.496 --> 49:15.360
- [Sandra] Thank you for
worrying about me, Lee,

49:15.360 --> 49:17.073
but I love throwing dinner parties,

49:17.073 --> 49:18.713
and I am only four months pregnant.

49:18.713 --> 49:19.546
- Only?

49:20.526 --> 49:23.842
- [Sandra] You're drinking tonight, Kate?

49:23.842 --> 49:25.092
- Just a glass.

49:27.818 --> 49:30.216
So, Chuck, you're Sandra's boss?

49:30.216 --> 49:31.366
I didn't know that, interesting.

49:31.366 --> 49:32.684
- Oh, well, why would you?

49:32.684 --> 49:35.396
Ah, Sandy's the best though, isn't she?

49:35.396 --> 49:36.589
- Thank you, Chuck.

49:36.589 --> 49:37.776
Too sweet.

49:37.776 --> 49:39.508
- Too sweet is right.

49:39.508 --> 49:42.184
If I don't keep a close eye
on this one at all times,

49:42.184 --> 49:47.184
who knows what I'll find
sniffing around for a taste?

49:47.331 --> 49:49.149
- He is a catch!

49:49.149 --> 49:51.486
- Kate, we've met before, am I right?

49:51.486 --> 49:52.726
- Don't think so.

49:52.726 --> 49:56.115
- No, Kate has a terrible
memory, like real bad.

49:56.115 --> 49:57.492
- [Sandra] That's true.

49:57.492 --> 50:00.202
- No, it was last year
at the Christmas party.

50:00.202 --> 50:01.708
- Oh?
- Yeah, I'm sure of it.

50:01.708 --> 50:03.687
It's just weird I didn't
remember it until right now.

50:03.687 --> 50:06.269
- I don't think I met
Sandra's boss, that night.

50:06.269 --> 50:08.055
- Like I said, terrible memory.

50:08.055 --> 50:10.056
- Well, that was right
before your second medical

50:10.056 --> 50:11.584
leave from work, right?

50:11.584 --> 50:12.638
- Second?

50:12.638 --> 50:14.672
- You know, after our second child,

50:14.672 --> 50:17.222
I went to the spa for an entire week.

50:17.222 --> 50:19.176
- Not quite the same thing.

50:19.176 --> 50:20.425
- A spa, you went to a spa?

50:20.425 --> 50:21.313
Nice.

50:21.313 --> 50:22.879
- You've never been to a spa?

50:22.879 --> 50:24.350
- You mean like a shvitz?

50:24.350 --> 50:26.336
I saw that on "The Sopranos" once.

50:26.336 --> 50:28.424
(laughing)

50:28.424 --> 50:30.775
- So, Cassie, what do you do?

50:30.775 --> 50:33.566
- Well, I'm a stay at home mother.

50:33.566 --> 50:35.646
- [Chuck] Mm-hmm, yep.

50:35.646 --> 50:37.603
- That's really rewarding.

50:37.603 --> 50:38.436
- Quite.

50:48.001 --> 50:49.629
- Oh, the food's great,
by the way, Sandra.

50:49.629 --> 50:51.337
Uh, real good, thank you.

50:51.337 --> 50:53.170
Uh, I mean, you know, the asparagus

50:53.170 --> 50:55.641
is a little mushy, you know?

50:55.641 --> 50:56.911
- [Chuck] That's not nice, Lee.

50:56.911 --> 50:59.026
- Well, you can't fault him
for being honest, can ya?

50:59.026 --> 51:01.044
- [Lee] No, no, no, hey come
on, it's probably just me.

51:01.044 --> 51:03.053
- [Cassie] I think
yours are great, Sandra.

51:03.053 --> 51:04.042
- It's really excellent, Sandy.

51:04.042 --> 51:07.349
- Like I said, probably just me.

51:07.349 --> 51:10.552
- Chuck, did you see the
new numbers that came in?

51:10.552 --> 51:11.819
- Oh, no, no, no, no work.

51:11.819 --> 51:13.467
We're all havin' a good time.

51:13.467 --> 51:14.487
- You're right.

51:14.487 --> 51:16.622
My dad used to always say the same thing,

51:16.622 --> 51:18.759
"No work talk at the dinner table."

51:18.759 --> 51:20.348
- Well, that's a lie.

51:20.348 --> 51:24.230
Our father never even
made it home for dinner.

51:24.230 --> 51:26.775
- Well, thank you for that, Kate.

51:26.775 --> 51:28.775
- I'm just being honest.

51:33.132 --> 51:35.299
- So, Lee, what do you do?

51:36.258 --> 51:38.468
- Well, I'm an artist, actually.

51:38.468 --> 51:39.768
- You're an artist?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:39.768 --> 51:41.388
- What kind, are you a painter or--

51:41.388 --> 51:43.083
- No, no, that's, that's
more Kate's thing.

51:43.083 --> 51:46.061
I'm a, you know, I'm a musician.

51:46.061 --> 51:47.667
- A musician?
- Yeah.

51:47.667 --> 51:49.194
- You got a steady gig somewhere?

51:49.194 --> 51:51.727
- I mean, you could say I'm
between jobs at the moment.

51:51.727 --> 51:53.487
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

51:53.487 --> 51:55.442
- [Chuck] What happened?

51:55.442 --> 51:57.487
I mean, if you don't mind me asking.

51:57.487 --> 51:59.489
- [Cassie] Chuck...

51:59.489 --> 52:02.489
- I take it you know I went to jail?

52:03.491 --> 52:05.416
- Well, you know how it is.

52:05.416 --> 52:07.411
It's best to be notified if
there's gonna be a convict

52:07.411 --> 52:08.550
at the dinner table.

52:08.550 --> 52:10.708
Gotta leave the kids at home, right?

52:10.708 --> 52:13.337
(laughing)

52:13.337 --> 52:15.553
- Nice one.
- Just kidding.

52:15.553 --> 52:17.367
- And what-what do you do, Chuck?

52:17.367 --> 52:18.479
- Oh me?

52:18.479 --> 52:19.312
Accounting.

52:19.312 --> 52:21.161
Numbers, math.

52:21.161 --> 52:23.764
It's really quite boring, honestly.

52:23.764 --> 52:25.418
I make a lot of money.

52:25.418 --> 52:28.383
But I'm actually more interested in you.

52:28.383 --> 52:29.438
What was prison like?

52:29.438 --> 52:30.271
- I don't think Lee wants to
talk about that right now--

52:30.271 --> 52:31.658
- No, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

52:31.658 --> 52:33.702
Uh, you know, three meals a day.

52:33.702 --> 52:36.163
Uh, plenty of exercise.

52:36.163 --> 52:38.219
I mean, to be honest with you,

52:38.219 --> 52:40.611
I just did what I could to,
to get out early and get

52:40.611 --> 52:41.801
back to Kate.

52:41.801 --> 52:43.514
- Oh, that's sweet.
- Yeah.

52:43.514 --> 52:45.396
- What's the next step though?

52:45.396 --> 52:46.544
You're a felon now, right?

52:46.544 --> 52:49.160
- It's not like I'm dangerous or anything.

52:49.160 --> 52:50.827
- No, no, of course.

52:52.096 --> 52:54.503
But you're a felon, correct?

52:54.503 --> 52:57.633
I mean, that's gotta
come with a few strings.

52:57.633 --> 52:59.675
You can't work for the government.

52:59.675 --> 53:02.137
A private company won't hire you, I mean,

53:02.137 --> 53:04.137
ours certainly wouldn't.

53:05.530 --> 53:08.357
You can't work with kids.

53:08.357 --> 53:09.667
Do you have any laboring skills?

53:09.667 --> 53:10.518
'Cause I know a lot of those companies

53:10.518 --> 53:11.813
actually take on ex-cons.

53:11.813 --> 53:15.150
- I hear there are all
sorts of nonprofit programs

53:15.150 --> 53:18.613
working to help convicts
get back on their feet.

53:18.613 --> 53:20.007
- I heard that too.

53:20.007 --> 53:22.734
That might be worth looking into, Lee.

53:22.734 --> 53:24.067
- Yeah, why not?

53:26.213 --> 53:28.811
- You know, we've got
lemon meringue for dessert.

53:28.811 --> 53:29.829
- [Sandra] Yes!

53:29.829 --> 53:32.565
- God you know what, I don't mean to pry.

53:32.565 --> 53:35.914
I just know, if I couldn't
support Cassie here,

53:35.914 --> 53:38.664
and my babies, I would feel like,

53:40.172 --> 53:41.255
I don't know.

53:42.843 --> 53:45.089
I guess I would feel
like not much of a man.

53:45.089 --> 53:46.395
- Like I said, I'm a musician.

53:46.395 --> 53:47.861
- Yeah, that's right.

53:47.861 --> 53:48.856
What were you guys called?

53:48.856 --> 53:50.332
Maybe we've heard of you.

53:50.332 --> 53:51.231
- Probably not.

53:51.231 --> 53:53.614
Yeah, we cater to a cultured crowd.

53:53.614 --> 53:54.447
- Ah.

53:55.515 --> 53:57.318
- [Lee] Yeah.

53:57.318 --> 53:58.465
- Hey, Kate.

53:58.465 --> 53:59.660
What do you think of Lee's music?

53:59.660 --> 54:00.493
- Well, Chuck--
- She loves it.

54:00.493 --> 54:01.355
Thanks for asking.

54:01.355 --> 54:02.793
- I didn't ask you.

54:02.793 --> 54:03.695
I asked Kate.

54:03.695 --> 54:04.936
- And I fucking answered.

54:04.936 --> 54:08.534
- Okay, there is no need
to swear at the table, Lee.

54:08.534 --> 54:12.722
- We're just having a friendly
conversation, right, Lee?

54:12.722 --> 54:14.222
- I didn't notice.

54:20.670 --> 54:23.503
- Well, nobody asked me what I do.

54:24.800 --> 54:28.800
I'm a bank teller, in
case anyone was wondering.

54:34.308 --> 54:36.111
- What the fuck is going on, Kate?

54:36.111 --> 54:37.586
How do you know my boss?

54:37.586 --> 54:38.616
- I don't know him.

54:38.616 --> 54:39.838
- Oh, you don't know him?

54:39.838 --> 54:42.036
Did you fuck him, hmm?

54:42.036 --> 54:42.985
Were you fucking him?

54:42.985 --> 54:44.521
Are you fucking him?

54:44.521 --> 54:45.866
- I am not currently fucking him, no.

54:45.866 --> 54:48.049
- Oh my God, oh my God.

54:48.049 --> 54:49.145
Why?

54:49.145 --> 54:50.486
Why?

54:51.499 --> 54:53.800
- If it's any consolation, I
didn't know he was your boss.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.162
He told me he didn't
even work at the company.

54:55.162 --> 54:57.475
- That is not a consolation, Kate.

54:57.475 --> 55:00.377
You are, you are ruining my dinner party!

55:00.377 --> 55:01.788
- Fine, then I lied about your asparagus

55:01.788 --> 55:04.171
to make you feel better.

55:04.171 --> 55:06.131
- What is wrong with you?

55:06.131 --> 55:08.928
Every single time I think
you're growing up just

55:08.928 --> 55:11.301
a little bit, you go and do something dumb

55:11.301 --> 55:13.763
and fucked up and ridiculous!

55:13.763 --> 55:15.518
- Stop trying to stick
your perfect little fingers

55:15.518 --> 55:16.753
in everyone's business.

55:16.753 --> 55:18.671
I realize you were raised
to think the world revolves

55:18.671 --> 55:20.650
around your eerily symmetrical face,

55:20.650 --> 55:21.745
but it doesn't.

55:21.745 --> 55:23.858
- You know what?

55:23.858 --> 55:25.278
I try.

55:25.278 --> 55:28.553
I try so hard.

55:30.370 --> 55:32.209
But you just don't care.

55:32.209 --> 55:33.239
You don't care.

55:33.239 --> 55:36.117
You don't care about my well-being.

55:36.117 --> 55:37.912
You don't care about my happiness.

55:37.912 --> 55:39.425
You don't care about my life.

55:39.425 --> 55:40.860
- Mom's dead, Sandra.

55:40.860 --> 55:43.313
You were at the funeral, we
both saw her go in the ground.

55:43.313 --> 55:45.932
You're not fooling anyone
with this little routine here.

55:45.932 --> 55:46.923
- Really?

55:46.923 --> 55:49.922
Who paid for rehab when you went away?

55:49.922 --> 55:51.435
Me.

55:51.435 --> 55:54.360
Who has set you up with at least a dozen

55:54.360 --> 55:57.139
handsome, polite suitors?

55:57.139 --> 55:57.972
That's me.

55:59.094 --> 56:01.061
Who found your new fucking apartment?

56:01.061 --> 56:02.689
- Yeah, I forgot to
tell you how much I love

56:02.689 --> 56:03.734
being your guinea pig.

56:03.734 --> 56:05.905
Let's just test out
parenting on Kate before

56:05.905 --> 56:08.282
baby number one pops out
just in case we fuck it up

56:08.282 --> 56:09.260
the first time.

56:09.260 --> 56:11.486
Let's, let's make Kate pack
the house, make Kate move,

56:11.486 --> 56:13.276
make Kate come over, make Kate play nice.

56:13.276 --> 56:14.429
- You don't get it!

56:14.429 --> 56:16.346
You don't get it, Kate!

56:25.187 --> 56:26.520
- What the fuck?

56:29.497 --> 56:30.914
- Oh, goddamn it!

56:32.062 --> 56:35.018
- You're fucking pregnant,
you fucking dumbass!

56:35.018 --> 56:37.185
(panting)

56:59.789 --> 57:00.956
- You hate me.

57:03.503 --> 57:05.003
- I don't mean to.

57:08.692 --> 57:12.867
(sighing)

57:23.147 --> 57:24.980
- Mind if I steal one?

57:26.485 --> 57:29.030
- Didn't know you smoked.

57:29.030 --> 57:31.287
- I haven't in years.

57:31.287 --> 57:33.034
Sandra made me quit.

57:33.034 --> 57:34.053
- Oh yeah?

57:34.053 --> 57:36.720
She make you do a lot of things?

57:37.946 --> 57:39.435
- Is it that obvious?

57:39.435 --> 57:40.268
- No.

57:42.936 --> 57:43.769
Uh, maybe.

57:49.224 --> 57:50.628
- You know, hats off
to you for not cracking

57:50.628 --> 57:52.295
that guy back there.

57:53.886 --> 57:57.472
Back in the day, I would
have done it myself.

57:57.472 --> 57:58.694
- Sure.

57:58.694 --> 58:00.039
Okay.

58:00.039 --> 58:01.039
- It's true.

58:02.321 --> 58:07.190
I went to juvie when I was 18
for beating a kid's face in.

58:07.190 --> 58:08.538
- Does Sandra know?

58:08.538 --> 58:09.371
- Yeah.

58:11.403 --> 58:13.027
- Wow.

58:13.027 --> 58:18.027
- You know, I was still getting
in scraps when we first met.

58:18.950 --> 58:19.867
Eventually...

58:21.785 --> 58:23.868
she gave me an ultimatum.

58:25.363 --> 58:30.135
She said, "Either grow
up and stop being a punk,

58:30.135 --> 58:31.552
"or I'm leaving."

58:34.232 --> 58:35.632
So I did.

58:35.632 --> 58:37.035
- Congratulations.

58:37.035 --> 58:37.868
Yeah.

58:38.886 --> 58:39.969
- My point is

58:42.021 --> 58:47.021
It's not a question of
whether or not you can change.

58:47.191 --> 58:51.024
It's a question of whether
or not you want to.

58:55.899 --> 58:58.232
- You make the right choice?

59:00.771 --> 59:02.429
- I'd like to think so.

59:18.970 --> 59:19.803
(keys jingling)

59:26.555 --> 59:29.138
- Were you sleeping with Chuck?

59:33.966 --> 59:34.799
- No.

59:38.041 --> 59:41.208
- Look, I'm sorry about tonight, okay?

59:43.167 --> 59:44.417
- Yeah, me too.

01:00:14.088 --> 01:00:16.976
- [Lee] Elephants can feel
a range of human emotions,

01:00:16.976 --> 01:00:19.513
including remorse, which
they avail themselves

01:00:19.513 --> 01:00:23.171
of by hugging one another
with their trunks.

01:00:23.171 --> 01:00:25.754
I wish I had a trunk sometimes.

01:00:39.925 --> 01:00:42.675
(phone vibrates)

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.073
- Hey.

01:00:48.013 --> 01:00:49.596
- [Kate] Hey, babe.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.192
- Babe?

01:00:52.192 --> 01:00:53.879
That's new.

01:00:53.879 --> 01:00:57.467
Your old pet names used
to be more like asshole,

01:00:57.467 --> 01:00:59.691
fuckface, douchebag.

01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:01.001
- I didn't know you were such a masochist.

01:01:01.001 --> 01:01:04.698
I never would have stopped using those.

01:01:04.698 --> 01:01:06.121
- How's work?

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:07.321
- Uh... long.

01:01:07.321 --> 01:01:09.593
Just in the office prepping
for a meeting tomorrow.

01:01:09.593 --> 01:01:10.824
You?

01:01:10.824 --> 01:01:14.841
- I uh... actually I
went to see Russ today.

01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:16.026
About a job.

01:01:16.026 --> 01:01:17.256
- [Kate] A job?

01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:18.665
- Yeah, a job.

01:01:18.665 --> 01:01:19.732
- Like a criminal job?

01:01:19.732 --> 01:01:21.632
Because it kinda sounds
like a criminal job.

01:01:21.632 --> 01:01:24.483
- [Lee] No, like a real job, at his bar.

01:01:24.483 --> 01:01:26.131
- Doesn't he own a lounge?

01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:27.487
- Seriously?

01:01:27.487 --> 01:01:31.140
- [Kate] I'm sorry, Lee, that's great.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.618
- [Lee] I'm not playing on stage.

01:01:32.618 --> 01:01:35.303
I'm busing tables and mopping floors, but,

01:01:35.303 --> 01:01:36.886
but it's a job, so.

01:01:38.003 --> 01:01:40.420
- Hey, I'll head out now and um...

01:01:41.317 --> 01:01:43.976
I'll try and catch you
before you go and maybe give

01:01:43.976 --> 01:01:46.256
you a little good luck action beforehand.

01:01:46.256 --> 01:01:48.442
- Well, don't make
promises you can't keep.

01:01:48.442 --> 01:01:50.275
- Leaving as we speak.

("Blues Shuffle Heart"
by The Roamin' Jasmine)

01:02:10.708 --> 01:02:12.305
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:02:12.305 --> 01:02:13.514
Traffic was worse than I thought.

01:02:13.514 --> 01:02:15.399
I had to take like six buses,

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:17.539
and one shifty Mexican
farm truck just to--

01:02:17.539 --> 01:02:18.694
- Wow!

01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:21.753
You look amazing, Kate (whistles).

01:02:21.753 --> 01:02:23.101
- What's going on?

01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:23.957
You're late.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:25.437
- Yeah, I just figured I'd, you know,

01:02:25.437 --> 01:02:27.565
soak up a little liquid courage
first, that's all, you know.

01:02:27.565 --> 01:02:29.703
- [Kate] You can't go to work drunk, Lee.

01:02:29.703 --> 01:02:31.664
- [Lee] Come on, relax,
it's a bar, they won't care.

01:02:31.664 --> 01:02:32.997
- It's a lounge.

01:02:34.377 --> 01:02:35.919
- Fuck's sake.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:36.944
Okay, Kate?

01:02:36.944 --> 01:02:39.423
Kate, Kate, just have
one drink with me please?

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:40.448
Just one?

01:02:40.448 --> 01:02:41.281
- I have a meeting tomorrow.

01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:42.688
- [Lee] Well, come on,
it's all the better then.

01:02:42.688 --> 01:02:44.328
Just take the, take
the edge off, you know,

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:45.593
help you sleep, just one?

01:02:45.593 --> 01:02:49.223
- Why do you think I bought Nyquil?

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:50.807
Lee, you have to go to work.

01:02:50.807 --> 01:02:53.351
You promised Russ and, frankly,

01:02:53.351 --> 01:02:55.684
I can't support you
anymore, financially, so--

01:02:55.684 --> 01:02:59.192
- Kate, Kate, I don't
have to do anything, okay?

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:01.985
I have been in captivity
for three years, okay?

01:03:01.985 --> 01:03:03.586
There are two things that I wanna do.

01:03:03.586 --> 01:03:07.253
Number one, I want an
American cheeseburger.

01:03:08.119 --> 01:03:09.573
Ah, and the other--

01:03:09.573 --> 01:03:10.490
- Iron Man?

01:03:11.592 --> 01:03:12.675
- Aw, busted.

01:03:14.986 --> 01:03:17.036
- Lee, please be serious
here for a second.

01:03:17.036 --> 01:03:18.235
Please?

01:03:18.235 --> 01:03:20.072
- I'm dead serious, Kate.

01:03:20.072 --> 01:03:20.905
Look.

01:03:24.587 --> 01:03:27.171
This is called the coma cocktail, okay?

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:28.635
Because, uh...

01:03:28.635 --> 01:03:31.876
Whoo! Well, you get the point.

01:03:31.876 --> 01:03:34.726

01:05:54.767 --> 01:05:57.517
(phone vibrates)

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:00.705
- Morning, Murphy.

01:06:00.705 --> 01:06:02.122
What's up, buddy?

01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:14.634
Ouch.

01:06:15.929 --> 01:06:16.846
Ow, Murphy!

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.226
Hey, shhh.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.723
- [Voicemail] You have two new messages.

01:06:24.723 --> 01:06:26.159
First message.

01:06:26.159 --> 01:06:27.395
- [Russ] Lee.

01:06:27.395 --> 01:06:29.330
You asked for a second chance.

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:32.107
You didn't show up for work.

01:06:32.107 --> 01:06:33.963
You're dead, you understand?

01:06:33.963 --> 01:06:35.645
- Oh.
- You're dead, motherfucker.

01:06:35.645 --> 01:06:37.072
- [Voicemail] Next message.

01:06:37.072 --> 01:06:38.925
- [Sandra] Hey Lee, it's Sandra.

01:06:38.925 --> 01:06:39.808
So Kate and I are coming over--

01:06:39.808 --> 01:06:41.950
- Oh Murph, come on, buddy.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.925
- [Sandra] To clean up the
mess you made last night,

01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:46.034
but don't worry about
leaving that little mess.

01:06:46.034 --> 01:06:47.651
We'll handle it.

01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:49.393
- [Voicemail] End of messages.

01:06:56.577 --> 01:06:57.717
- Hey Sandra, what's going on?

01:06:57.717 --> 01:06:59.828
Murphy, get in, in!

01:06:59.828 --> 01:07:00.661
Huh?

01:07:03.741 --> 01:07:05.687
Hey Sandra, what's Kate doing, huh?

01:07:05.687 --> 01:07:06.947
Why is she packing?

01:07:06.947 --> 01:07:09.062
We're not moving, she's not moving.

01:07:09.062 --> 01:07:10.062
Hello, what?

01:07:11.315 --> 01:07:12.290
Why is Kate packing?

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:13.707
She's not moving.

01:07:15.777 --> 01:07:16.758
What?

01:07:16.758 --> 01:07:18.365
- What are you doing, Lee?

01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:19.512
- [Lee] W-what do you
mean, what am I doing?

01:07:19.512 --> 01:07:21.262
- What are you doing?

01:07:31.043 --> 01:07:32.293
- I don't know.

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:38.034
- You made me a promise, Lee.

01:07:38.034 --> 01:07:41.617
You promised you would
stay away from Kate.

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:46.588
Right I, I wrote at least
a dozen letters to help get

01:07:46.588 --> 01:07:49.048
you released early, and the first thing,

01:07:49.048 --> 01:07:50.461
the first thing you do--

01:07:50.461 --> 01:07:52.751
- Who else do I have, Sandra?

01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:54.751
Come on, tell me.

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:56.359
- So that's it?

01:07:56.359 --> 01:07:58.695
You just came running back
to Kate because you knew she

01:07:58.695 --> 01:08:02.074
would be here like, like a loyal puppy?

01:08:02.074 --> 01:08:04.038
- No, I came became I love her.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:06.399
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:08:06.399 --> 01:08:09.316
- Well, you've never told her that.

01:08:15.885 --> 01:08:16.718
Look.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:22.219
I know you think I hate you.

01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:24.841
But I don't.

01:08:25.743 --> 01:08:27.051
I really don't, okay?

01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:28.051
You're just...

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.937
You're not good for Kate.

01:08:31.937 --> 01:08:34.270
And she is not good for you.

01:08:36.551 --> 01:08:38.884
She'll never leave you, Lee.

01:08:40.154 --> 01:08:43.488
So, if that is what you want, then fine.

01:08:48.205 --> 01:08:50.537
But if you love my sister...

01:08:52.148 --> 01:08:54.731
Then you'll do the right thing.

01:09:00.331 --> 01:09:03.801
Um... also, Chuck is having
a party tonight and he wants

01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:05.331
you and Kate there so he can apologize.

01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:06.163
- [Lee] It's not a good idea.

01:09:06.163 --> 01:09:07.939
- Yeah, no shit, I know
it's not a good idea, Lee,

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:09.970
but you're going to show up,
and you're gonna accept his

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:12.970
apology because I am telling you to.

01:09:14.895 --> 01:09:15.729
Got it?

01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:27.698
I gotta get ready, so
see you guys tonight.

01:09:40.031 --> 01:09:43.885
- I'm making some hangover
food, you want anything?

01:09:43.885 --> 01:09:44.718
Okay.

01:09:50.743 --> 01:09:52.243
Same fuckin' eggs.

01:09:53.104 --> 01:09:53.937
What happened, Kate?

01:09:53.937 --> 01:09:55.487
They're spoiled, huh?

01:09:55.487 --> 01:09:58.282
You used to love eating eggs.

01:09:58.282 --> 01:10:00.061
- [Kate] I can't anymore,
they make me sick.

01:10:00.061 --> 01:10:00.998
- Well, then the logical thing to do

01:10:00.998 --> 01:10:02.112
would be to throw them out, wouldn't it?

01:10:02.112 --> 01:10:03.446
- Stop it.

01:10:03.446 --> 01:10:04.315
- Why?

01:10:04.315 --> 01:10:05.910
- Because I don't know,
I might start eating them

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.189
again, down the road.

01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:09.119
- That makes no sense-- - I said stop it.

01:10:09.119 --> 01:10:10.113
- What is your problem?

01:10:10.113 --> 01:10:11.295
- I don't want you to
throw out the fucking eggs.

01:10:11.295 --> 01:10:13.053
I want the fucking eggs
to stay right here,

01:10:13.053 --> 01:10:15.188
so that they'll be there
if I want them, okay?

01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:16.040
- You're being ridiculous.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.709
- When I'm done with the eggs,
I will throw them out, Lee.

01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:18.755
You got that?

01:10:18.755 --> 01:10:20.255
I will throw the fucking eggs out.

01:10:20.255 --> 01:10:21.456
- You know what, I'm not
gonna argue with someone who

01:10:21.456 --> 01:10:22.758
makes no fucking sense, so whatever, okay?

01:10:22.758 --> 01:10:25.887
I gotta buy cigarettes anyway, fuck you.

01:10:25.887 --> 01:10:27.498
Hey, what the fuck?
(egg splattering)

01:10:27.498 --> 01:10:28.974
- You want me to get
rid of the fucking eggs?

01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:30.660
You want me to forget about
the fucking eggs, Lee?

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.352
- What is wrong with you?
- Huh, huh?

01:10:32.352 --> 01:10:33.726
This is what you want, right?

01:10:33.726 --> 01:10:34.602
Right?
- Kate, hey!

01:10:34.602 --> 01:10:36.942
- Fine, fucking--
- Would you, would you,

01:10:36.942 --> 01:10:39.230
would you stop it?

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:40.063
Jesus Chr--

01:10:54.079 --> 01:10:56.412
What is wrong with you, huh?

01:11:00.247 --> 01:11:02.698
- I'm fine, just forget it!

01:11:02.698 --> 01:11:03.948
Just forget it.

01:11:05.837 --> 01:11:10.609
- You wanna talk about
what just happened, maybe?

01:11:10.609 --> 01:11:11.609
Hello, Kate?

01:11:13.765 --> 01:11:15.515
- [Kate] No, I don't.

01:11:17.868 --> 01:11:19.551
You can put on your own tie tonight.

01:11:19.551 --> 01:11:20.384
(door slamming)

01:11:23.984 --> 01:11:27.026
(Murphy eating loudly)

01:11:42.422 --> 01:11:43.505
- Nice boots.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.047
(playful Jazz music)

01:12:10.075 --> 01:12:12.258
Look, Kate, uh...

01:12:12.258 --> 01:12:14.019
Look I'm sorry, okay?

01:12:14.019 --> 01:12:16.485
I shouldn't have made
you drink last night.

01:12:16.485 --> 01:12:19.945
I should have just--
- You don't get it, Lee.

01:12:19.945 --> 01:12:22.125
You didn't make me do anything.

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:25.792
I did it because I
wanted to do it with you.

01:12:29.676 --> 01:12:30.759
We should go.

01:12:35.402 --> 01:12:38.235
(people chatting)

01:12:41.811 --> 01:12:42.826
- [Sandra] I'll be back.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:43.940
Hello, hello, hello!

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:45.023
- Hey.

01:12:45.023 --> 01:12:46.670
- You look beautiful.

01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:47.503
- Thank you.

01:12:47.503 --> 01:12:49.875
- And, Kate, I like your boots.

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:51.281
(laughing)

01:12:51.281 --> 01:12:55.102
Lee. Come with me, I'll
introduce you to some people.

01:12:55.102 --> 01:12:57.769
(playful Jazz music)

01:13:11.469 --> 01:13:12.555
- I'm a producer.
- Wow.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.049
- Oh, wow, that's great.

01:13:14.049 --> 01:13:15.294
- Yeah.

01:13:15.294 --> 01:13:16.127
- Should we get a drink?
- Yeah.

01:13:16.127 --> 01:13:17.069
- We're gonna get a drink.

01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:17.902
- All right, see you later.

01:13:17.902 --> 01:13:18.735
- What's the matter?

01:13:18.735 --> 01:13:20.506
You should be thanking this
man, he's made a lot of movies.

01:13:20.506 --> 01:13:21.698
- Entertainment, what was that?

01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:22.660
- It's called networking.

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:24.315
Didn't you, like, network in prison

01:13:24.315 --> 01:13:25.605
to get ramen noodles or shivs?

01:13:25.605 --> 01:13:27.089
- No, I remember when
networking was about buying

01:13:27.089 --> 01:13:29.114
a round of shots for somebody at the bar.

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:32.142
- Yeah, 'cause that'll get you the job.

01:13:32.142 --> 01:13:32.975
- Kate!

01:13:34.154 --> 01:13:34.987
Lee!

01:13:34.987 --> 01:13:35.820
- No fucking tie.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:36.653
I can't believe this fucking guy.

01:13:36.653 --> 01:13:39.239
- It's fine, just leave it.

01:13:39.239 --> 01:13:40.658
- So nice of you guys to join us.

01:13:40.658 --> 01:13:41.790
- Thank you.

01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:43.051
- Mmm.

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:44.150
So what do you guys think?

01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:45.137
How do you like the place?

01:13:45.137 --> 01:13:46.153
- [Kate] It's gorgeous,

01:13:46.153 --> 01:13:46.986
thank you for inviting us.

01:13:46.986 --> 01:13:47.819
- Yeah.

01:13:47.819 --> 01:13:49.551
I mean, it's a little
too open for my taste,

01:13:49.551 --> 01:13:50.662
but, I mean, it's not bad.

01:13:50.662 --> 01:13:52.382
- So where's Cassie tonight?

01:13:52.382 --> 01:13:53.215
- Cassie?

01:13:53.215 --> 01:13:54.928
She went to Bali for the month.

01:13:54.928 --> 01:13:55.841
- Oh!
- With the gals.

01:13:55.841 --> 01:13:56.745
- Wow.

01:13:56.745 --> 01:13:58.390
- Well, I hear Bali's
supposed to be great this

01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:59.223
time of year, you know?

01:13:59.223 --> 01:14:00.306
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:03.977
Hey, I just wanted to apologize
about the other night.

01:14:03.977 --> 01:14:06.140
I had one too many scotches.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.108
Gets me buckin' like a
bull, you know how it is.

01:14:08.108 --> 01:14:10.691
- You were drinking Merlot, no?

01:14:14.169 --> 01:14:16.169
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry too.

01:14:17.067 --> 01:14:18.077
- All right.

01:14:18.077 --> 01:14:19.380
Well you guys enjoy
yourselves, it's a party.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:20.559
Grab a drink.

01:14:20.559 --> 01:14:22.721
There's a bartender floatin'
around here somewhere.

01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:23.993
At least, I paid for one. So...

01:14:26.109 --> 01:14:26.942
Kate.

01:14:26.949 --> 01:14:27.782
- Chuck.

01:14:29.503 --> 01:14:31.121
Oh uh... Sandy's over there.
- [Sandra] Kate, come here!

01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:31.954
I want you to meet Joan!

01:14:31.954 --> 01:14:32.787
- I'm gonna go smoke.
- She's in advertising too!

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.386
(sad jazz music)

01:14:35.403 --> 01:14:36.236
(sighing)

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:03.163
- Evening.

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:10.421
Oh, no.

01:15:12.628 --> 01:15:13.795
Sandra'll see.

01:15:14.916 --> 01:15:16.249
- Suit yourself.

01:15:23.056 --> 01:15:26.407
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said, and,

01:15:26.407 --> 01:15:28.824
I don't know if you're right.

01:15:29.746 --> 01:15:30.913
- What's that?

01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:35.398
- I don't think I can change.

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:39.238
It's like some part of me just knows

01:15:39.238 --> 01:15:42.983
I'm not gonna be any
better than Albany fuck up,

01:15:42.983 --> 01:15:44.733
Jake Riley, you know?

01:15:46.914 --> 01:15:49.834
- Can I assume that's your father?

01:15:49.834 --> 01:15:51.751
- Yeah, you can assume.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:56.073
I dunno, it's just, look, it's like,

01:15:56.073 --> 01:15:58.981
I'm gonna go home tonight,
and there's gonna be dog

01:15:58.981 --> 01:16:02.161
vomit all over the fuckin'
house you know, 'cause uh...

01:16:02.161 --> 01:16:06.328
'cause I let this poor,
dumb dog eat spoiled eggs.

01:16:07.227 --> 01:16:11.394
You know, and I dunno,
it's, it's on me, you know?

01:16:14.317 --> 01:16:16.320
- Gonna be honest with you, mate.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.903
I fuckin' lost you.

01:16:19.657 --> 01:16:23.407
- It just doesn't matter
how bad you want it.

01:16:25.574 --> 01:16:28.049
- If you wanted it bad enough,

01:16:28.049 --> 01:16:30.382
you wouldn't be saying that.

01:16:44.762 --> 01:16:48.262
(whistles) Drink, please.

01:17:04.257 --> 01:17:06.435
- [Waiter] No tip?

01:17:06.435 --> 01:17:08.285
- You want a tip?

01:17:08.285 --> 01:17:09.682
- [Waiter] Well, if you
don't have any cash,

01:17:09.682 --> 01:17:10.515
you could give me a check.

01:17:10.515 --> 01:17:11.747
- Okay, I'll give you a tip.

01:17:11.747 --> 01:17:12.580
Okay...

01:17:13.626 --> 01:17:14.459
Come here.

01:17:15.648 --> 01:17:20.124
Stay as far away from these
fuckin' people as you can?

01:17:20.124 --> 01:17:21.224
Okay?

01:17:21.224 --> 01:17:22.974
Good chat, good chat.

01:17:24.275 --> 01:17:25.108
- Thanks.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.363
- Hey, Chuck.

01:17:28.246 --> 01:17:29.842
Chuck.

01:17:29.842 --> 01:17:31.449
Yeah, I'm not fuckin' sorry, okay?

01:17:31.449 --> 01:17:32.852
Not even a little bit.

01:17:32.852 --> 01:17:34.113
- [Chuck] Excuse me?

01:17:34.113 --> 01:17:38.901
- Before, I said I was
sorry, and I'm not, okay?

01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:42.507
And that is the difference
between you and me, okay?

01:17:42.507 --> 01:17:45.200
At least I can acknowledge
that I'm a piece of shit.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.661
- You're gonna come into my house,

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:47.707
you're gonna eat my food,
you're gonna drink--

01:17:47.707 --> 01:17:48.557
- [Lee] Yeah, I haven't eaten anything,

01:17:48.557 --> 01:17:49.540
you know why?

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.673
Because I made better guac
when I was in fuckin' jail.

01:17:51.673 --> 01:17:52.785
- [Chuck] All right, guys?

01:17:52.785 --> 01:17:54.539
Guys, get this asshole out of here.

01:17:54.539 --> 01:17:56.381
- You have bodyguards at
a fuckin' house party?

01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:57.894
You fucking pansy.

01:17:57.894 --> 01:17:58.891
- [Kate] What's going on, what's going on?

01:17:58.891 --> 01:18:00.573
- [Chuck] What's going on is
your convict boyfriend here

01:18:00.573 --> 01:18:02.004
wants to square up against
me in my own house.

01:18:02.004 --> 01:18:03.176
- Oh, fuckin' square up, really?

01:18:03.176 --> 01:18:04.009
Huh, is that it?

01:18:04.009 --> 01:18:04.913
- Come on Lee I'm
calling an Uber, come on.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:05.852
- Yeah have her call you an Uber,

01:18:05.852 --> 01:18:07.833
'cause you can't afford an
Uber, you piece of shit.

01:18:07.833 --> 01:18:09.056
Good pick, Kate.

01:18:09.056 --> 01:18:09.948
Good luck with that one.

01:18:09.948 --> 01:18:11.211
- Hey, you know what?

01:18:11.211 --> 01:18:12.981
I'm sorry, you know what?

01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:14.352
I am so fuckin' stupid.

01:18:14.352 --> 01:18:16.271
You know, I almost went
off with your glass.

01:18:16.271 --> 01:18:17.207
Here, Chuck.

01:18:17.207 --> 01:18:18.290
- Oh, God--
- Here, take it.

01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:19.312
- Fuck!

01:18:19.312 --> 01:18:20.411
- My hand slipped.

01:18:20.411 --> 01:18:21.403
I'm sorry, Chuck.

01:18:21.403 --> 01:18:23.003
- I'm gonna sue your ass, motherfucker!

01:18:23.003 --> 01:18:24.740
All $10 you're worth!

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:25.872
- I'm fuckin' sorry.
- I'm suing your dumb ass.

01:18:25.872 --> 01:18:27.224
- Yeah okay fuckin' enjoy it.
- You fucking idiot, come on!

01:18:27.224 --> 01:18:29.891
- [Chuck] Fuckin' asshole, fuck!

01:19:05.867 --> 01:19:08.416
- Kate, would you stop?

01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:10.301
Kate, would you stop
and talk to me please?

01:19:10.301 --> 01:19:11.460
- What's the fuckin' point?

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.418
- Oh, you're right, whatever, okay.

01:19:12.418 --> 01:19:13.745
Go on, good night, go.

01:19:13.745 --> 01:19:15.626
- Well, it's gonna be the
same conversation we always

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:17.291
have, so what's the fucking point?

01:19:17.291 --> 01:19:18.290
- What are you talking about?

01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:19.980
We haven't been together in
three fuckin' years, Kate.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:23.177
- And we were arguing about
the same exact shit back then.

01:19:23.177 --> 01:19:25.590
Three years in a fucking 10
by 10 cell did absolutely

01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:26.923
nothing for you?

01:19:28.596 --> 01:19:30.478
- The best night's sleep
I've gotten in a month--

01:19:30.478 --> 01:19:31.474
- Oh.

01:19:31.474 --> 01:19:33.149
- Was in a fucking closet, okay?

01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:35.114
It did plenty.

01:19:35.114 --> 01:19:36.653
- Do you remember what
we were fighting about,

01:19:36.653 --> 01:19:38.499
when you hit that guy?

01:19:38.499 --> 01:19:39.700
Do you remember what he said?

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.533
- Yeah, I remember everything.

01:19:40.533 --> 01:19:42.043
- Like how you wouldn't
amount to anything?

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:43.898
That you weren't good enough for me,

01:19:43.898 --> 01:19:47.233
right before you smashed a
bottle over his skull, huh?

01:19:47.233 --> 01:19:50.373
How is that any different
from tonight, Lee?

01:19:50.373 --> 01:19:52.213
- Well, I didn't use a bottle.

01:19:52.213 --> 01:19:53.523
- Oh, you're always so cute.

01:19:53.523 --> 01:19:55.859
You're so fucking cute.

01:19:55.859 --> 01:19:56.692
- Oh, yeah?

01:19:56.692 --> 01:19:58.076
Yeah, I look fucking cute?

01:19:58.076 --> 01:19:59.300
I look real fuckin' cute in this,

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:01.070
this fuckin' ironed shirt and this,

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:04.393
this nice fuckin' jacket,
and this fancy fuckin' tie?

01:20:04.393 --> 01:20:07.217
Who the fuck do you think I am, huh?

01:20:07.217 --> 01:20:09.341
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:20:09.341 --> 01:20:10.552
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

01:20:10.552 --> 01:20:12.183
Well, one second, you're
all about getting high,

01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:14.929
and skipping work, and
fucking my brains out,

01:20:14.929 --> 01:20:16.038
and the next, huh?

01:20:16.038 --> 01:20:18.667
The next, you wanna, you
wanna fuckin' dress me up,

01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:20.309
you wanna take me to a
fucking fancy dinner party

01:20:20.309 --> 01:20:22.431
and tell people I am in entertainment?

01:20:22.431 --> 01:20:23.658
"Oh, Lee is in entertainment."

01:20:23.658 --> 01:20:25.250
What the fuck does that mean, huh?

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:26.277
That's cute.

01:20:26.277 --> 01:20:28.318
- It's called growing up, Lee.

01:20:28.318 --> 01:20:29.812
It's called being a fucking adult.

01:20:29.812 --> 01:20:30.645
Why is it.

01:20:32.072 --> 01:20:34.746
Why is it that you can't accept
anything good in your life?

01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:36.871
Are you that much of a
fucking cynic that you just

01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:39.500
have to rip it all apart the
minute things start to work?

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.040
- Well maybe it's because
you tell me I'm bad for you

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.012
every five fuckin' minutes.

01:20:43.012 --> 01:20:43.845
Yeah.

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:46.925
And I know about Chuck.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:49.136
I'm not an idiot.

01:20:49.136 --> 01:20:50.796
- Lee.

01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:52.455
I love you.

01:20:53.579 --> 01:20:56.912
I love you more than you can understand.

01:20:59.325 --> 01:21:03.469
Which is why I need to tell
you you're not gonna make it

01:21:03.469 --> 01:21:04.636
as a musician.

01:21:06.817 --> 01:21:08.903
You're just not.

01:21:08.903 --> 01:21:11.490
And I don't say that out of spite.

01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:14.994
I say that because I care about you.

01:21:14.994 --> 01:21:17.161
And I want you to move on.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:20.536
You're passionate.

01:21:20.536 --> 01:21:21.619
And you're sweet--
- Save it.

01:21:21.619 --> 01:21:23.138
- I know if you put that--
- Fuckin' save it, Kate!

01:21:23.138 --> 01:21:26.708
- Into something else, if you
put that into something else,

01:21:26.708 --> 01:21:31.422
we might actually be able
to have a life together.

01:21:31.422 --> 01:21:34.965
We might actually be able
to go inside that house rip

01:21:34.965 --> 01:21:37.382
every box open, and be happy.

01:21:39.886 --> 01:21:41.136
I'm sorry, Lee.

01:21:44.145 --> 01:21:45.312
Say something.

01:21:46.774 --> 01:21:48.410
Say something, Lee.

01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:49.243
Come on, say something!

01:21:49.243 --> 01:21:50.441
Fuckin' yell at me, hit me!

01:21:50.441 --> 01:21:51.504
- Come on, shove me!

01:21:51.504 --> 01:21:53.458
- Call me cunt, yell at me!
- Come on, hit me, come on.

01:21:53.458 --> 01:21:54.399
Hit me all you want, come on.

01:21:54.399 --> 01:21:56.973
Hit me all you want
Kate, because that shit,

01:21:56.973 --> 01:21:59.734
that shit fucking heals, okay?

01:21:59.734 --> 01:22:03.567
But I already told you,
I remember everything.

01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:09.933
And for the record, Kate.

01:22:13.385 --> 01:22:16.014
I wouldn't take it back.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.847
Take your fuckin' tie.

01:22:59.764 --> 01:23:02.347
(somber music)

01:23:59.251 --> 01:24:02.168
- Do you remember the night we met?

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:07.557
It was August, I think.

01:24:09.096 --> 01:24:09.929
And um...

01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:16.400
I was working at that
bar, fucking Piano Bar.

01:24:21.313 --> 01:24:25.875
I don't even know if
it's still there anymore.

01:24:25.875 --> 01:24:28.992
Anyway it was hot as hell,

01:24:29.126 --> 01:24:32.543
and uh... my hair was
all fucked up and frizzy.

01:24:33.577 --> 01:24:37.554
And I was just in this shit
mood 'cause it was loud

01:24:37.554 --> 01:24:42.554
and cramped and it was
like, two for one Bud night.

01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:44.590
And so I'm like slinging
these things left and right,

01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:47.423
but no one's tipping, like at all.

01:24:48.376 --> 01:24:52.058
And, to top it off, this
asshole in the back starts

01:24:52.058 --> 01:24:55.212
banging on the fucking piano,

01:24:55.212 --> 01:24:57.684
singing to whatever the
hell they were playing, and,

01:24:57.684 --> 01:25:01.011
and he keeps fucking
throwing 20s in the basket,

01:25:01.011 --> 01:25:04.015
making them play the same song again and,

01:25:04.015 --> 01:25:05.348
again and again.

01:25:06.307 --> 01:25:10.307
And he's banging like a
fucking idiot each time.

01:25:14.615 --> 01:25:19.532
After like the sixth repeat,
I've had it, I'm done.

01:25:19.956 --> 01:25:23.615
And I walk over to kick him out,

01:25:24.056 --> 01:25:25.042
and I say--

01:25:25.042 --> 01:25:28.375
- "Does being an asshole come naturally?

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:32.500
"Or do you actually have to try?"

01:25:36.878 --> 01:25:39.295
I turned around and saw you.

01:25:40.424 --> 01:25:42.507
Your hair was all frizzy.

01:25:44.102 --> 01:25:46.852
And I thought you were beautiful.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.567
And I know it sounds stupid, but uh...

01:25:54.601 --> 01:25:56.351
Man I was speechless.

01:25:59.904 --> 01:26:01.612
So, you said,

01:26:05.238 --> 01:26:09.405
"You gotta go buddy, you're
pissing everyone off."

01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:16.863
And I said, "That's fine.

01:26:16.863 --> 01:26:20.946
"I was just about ready
to take you home anyway."

01:26:27.554 --> 01:26:29.221
I do love you, Kate.

01:26:31.349 --> 01:26:32.349
I really do.

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:42.567
And I do understand because
I remember it was July 28th.

01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:46.408
The song was "Piano Man".

01:26:47.721 --> 01:26:50.221
And you weren't slinging Buds.

01:26:52.257 --> 01:26:54.590
They were Miller High Lifes.

01:26:58.181 --> 01:27:01.143
I must have replayed that memory 100 times

01:27:01.143 --> 01:27:02.476
when I was away.

01:27:05.647 --> 01:27:10.456
And if I could relive one night again,

01:27:13.624 --> 01:27:15.374
It would be that one.

01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:19.420
Every time, it would be that one.
