00:24.218 --> 00:25.745
Our street performers
won't bother you anymore

00:25.902 --> 00:28.957
You know, we should visit
Shelbyville more often.

00:29.132 --> 00:31.699
They have a store
that just sells shoes.

00:31.881 --> 00:33.726
I feel like I'm in Paris!

00:34.882 --> 00:37.323
The famous Shelbyville
Theater District!

00:37.363 --> 00:39.527
Can we see a play?
- Play?!

00:39.528 --> 00:42.056
All plays suck, all the time,
and always will,

00:42.056 --> 00:44.309
and everyone knows it!
- Look, we'll compromise.

00:44.389 --> 00:45.738
We'll go see a play...

00:46.140 --> 00:47.838
that Lisa doesn't want to see.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.589
Let's see...

00:49.730 --> 00:51.691
there's Equus
starring Sideshow Mel,

00:51.888 --> 00:54.365
the Three Dollar Bills
in Gay, Gay, Gay!

00:55.998 --> 00:57.996
Song of Shelbyville.

00:59.455 --> 01:02.444
From the schoolhouse
where our grandparents learnt

01:02.620 --> 01:05.755
To the bad zoo
where all the animals burnt

01:05.932 --> 01:09.092
We're home to Christian,
Muslim and Jew

01:09.249 --> 01:12.215
Although not many
of the last two.

01:14.427 --> 01:16.520
There's a girl
for every guy

01:17.844 --> 01:20.632
Birthplace of the button fly

01:21.052 --> 01:29.076
In good ol' Shel-bee-ville!

01:32.874 --> 01:34.529
Say, fellow Shelbyvillian,

01:34.682 --> 01:36.640
enjoying our famous
low humidity?

01:36.797 --> 01:37.571
I'll say.

01:37.726 --> 01:39.203
The only thing lower
than our humidity

01:39.378 --> 01:41.843
are the greens fees
on our public golf course.

01:41.921 --> 01:43.992
Which one?
- All three!

01:44.431 --> 01:45.824
Yes. Yes.

01:46.508 --> 01:49.688
Why look,
it's Springfield Billy!

01:54.254 --> 01:56.330
What are you doing
here in Shelbyville?

01:56.499 --> 02:00.059
I came here for
the legalized gambling.

02:00.238 --> 02:01.364
But Springfield Billy,

02:01.517 --> 02:03.260
we don't have
legalized gambling here.

02:03.418 --> 02:04.571
Sure you do.

02:04.774 --> 02:08.922
I saw a bumper sticker
that said "Free Tibet."

02:12.934 --> 02:15.718
They're saying Springfielders
are stupid hicks.

02:15.887 --> 02:18.468
It's like lookin'
in a mirror.

02:18.623 --> 02:19.979
What's a mirror?

02:20.193 --> 02:22.933
It's a big city word
for reversifyin' glass.

02:26.306 --> 02:27.851
That show was hilarious.

02:28.076 --> 02:30.342
That Springfield Billy
cracks me up.

02:30.490 --> 02:31.759
For your information,

02:31.905 --> 02:34.205
Springfielders can be
intelligent and articulate.

02:34.383 --> 02:37.095
I happen to know because
we're from Springfield.

02:37.265 --> 02:38.784
Springfielders?!

02:45.843 --> 02:47.613
This is the worst crisis

02:47.614 --> 02:50.467
the Springfield Cultural
Activities Board has ever faced.

02:50.672 --> 02:53.609
Those Shelbyvillians
are maligning us all.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.480
I've never heard such
mean-spirited hate-hoots.

02:56.701 --> 02:59.285
We've got to upgrade
Springfield's image,

02:59.286 --> 03:00.831
show them we're more
than just a town

03:01.027 --> 03:02.472
that's still afraid
of eclipses.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.285
God steals sun :
Mayor offers sacrifices

03:04.671 --> 03:06.566
Hey, how 'bout we open
a fancy restaurant,

03:06.736 --> 03:08.425
and when people check their
hats and coats,

03:08.600 --> 03:09.492
we steal 'em?

03:09.663 --> 03:11.259
Why do you come
to these meetings?

03:11.429 --> 03:12.572
Free water.

03:12.735 --> 03:13.867
There must
be something else.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.159
Think, Marge, think.

03:15.319 --> 03:18.761
Culture... vulture...
birds of prey...

03:18.953 --> 03:21.826
pray in a church...
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost...

03:21.884 --> 03:24.552
ghosts are scary...
scary rhymes with Gehry!

03:24.717 --> 03:25.927
That's it!

03:26.127 --> 03:28.322
Architect Frank Gehry!

03:28.509 --> 03:31.808
He could build us a concert hall
like he did in Los Angeles.

03:32.047 --> 03:34.215
Well, we could use a new HQ

03:34.216 --> 03:35.750
for the Springfield
Philharmonic.

03:35.918 --> 03:38.273
They're playing Gustav Mahler
in abject squalor.

03:41.568 --> 03:42.478
Little help?

03:42.670 --> 03:44.357
Next time we're keeping it.

03:46.023 --> 03:47.174
Then it's agreed.

03:47.341 --> 03:50.195
We ask Frank Gehry
to build us a concert hall.

03:53.350 --> 03:56.829
Bill, bill,
Bilbao bill...

03:57.703 --> 03:59.875
Snoopy stationery!

04:01.178 --> 04:02.211
Dear Mr. Gehry,

04:02.384 --> 04:05.175
would you please build
a concert hall for our town?

04:05.350 --> 04:06.801
We may not be the biggest city,

04:06.962 --> 04:07.776
or the prettiest,

04:07.800 --> 04:10.297
but we were
the first city in America

04:10.496 --> 04:12.548
to abandon the metric system.

04:21.351 --> 04:23.402
Frank Gehry, you're a genius!

04:25.398 --> 04:28.317
Behold the new
Springfield Concert Hall.

04:29.472 --> 04:31.226
And none of this
would have happened

04:31.227 --> 04:34.175
if not for a letter
I received from one little girl.

04:34.354 --> 04:35.496
I wrote that letter.

04:35.654 --> 04:38.847
You wrote I was "the bestest
architect in the world"?

04:39.017 --> 04:39.880
Well, aren't you?

04:39.948 --> 04:42.849
All in favor of building
a $30 million

04:42.850 --> 04:44.322
"screw you"
to Shelbyville?

04:58.690 --> 05:01.167
Get  off my masterpiece,
you punks!

05:01.312 --> 05:02.619
I'll call your mothers!

05:02.769 --> 05:04.156
Yo, Frank Gehry!

05:04.328 --> 05:06.753
Like curvi-linear forms much?

05:11.587 --> 05:13.520
Hey cat, get your own pants!

05:16.468 --> 05:17.076
Kids!

05:17.136 --> 05:18.545
Why's the cat so fat?

05:18.641 --> 05:20.390
Dad, Snowball's not fat.

05:20.543 --> 05:21.902
She's just got winter fur.

05:24.978 --> 05:26.051
Okay, she's fat.

05:27.612 --> 05:28.860
Can't breathe....

05:29.100 --> 05:31.213
Someone dangle some string.

05:37.869 --> 05:39.144
I'm so excited.

05:39.293 --> 05:42.686
It's like giving birth
to a child of steel and iron.

05:52.955 --> 05:54.387
Where is everybody going?

05:54.544 --> 05:56.482
The symphony,
she has just started!

05:56.645 --> 05:58.801
So? We already heard
the "dum dum dum dum."

05:59.099 --> 06:00.242
The rest
is just filler.

06:00.405 --> 06:02.017
I thought this was gonna
be the soundtrack

06:02.020 --> 06:03.318
to the movie Beethoven.

06:03.602 --> 06:05.243
Was I sadly mistaken.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.095
It sounds better
on my cell phone.

06:10.209 --> 06:11.302
Don't leave now!

06:11.494 --> 06:15.037
The next piece is an atonal
medley by Philip Glass.

06:21.496 --> 06:23.138
Orchestra tonight :
Tickets half price!

06:23.316 --> 06:24.930
XXX movies all day

06:25.088 --> 06:27.609
An evening with
David Brenner

06:27.624 --> 06:29.192
You stupid hicks!

06:29.358 --> 06:31.723
Why  didn't you tell me
you hated classical music?

06:31.881 --> 06:32.992
We didn't have time.

06:33.115 --> 06:35.538
The concert hall was designed
and built so quickly.

06:35.704 --> 06:37.573
We're broke, but I have a plan.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.489
We change the name of the town
to escape our creditors.

06:40.644 --> 06:41.840
I need names, people!

06:41.990 --> 06:43.068
Lima, Peru!

06:43.198 --> 06:45.498
Gotham City! Wiggumville!
Burger King!

06:45.660 --> 06:47.309
Perhaps I can be
of assistance.

06:50.937 --> 06:53.243
Smithers, tear me
a new drape hole.

06:57.573 --> 06:59.197
If you hand over
the concert hall to me,

06:59.363 --> 07:00.925
I'll assume the debt

07:01.081 --> 07:03.516
and all of your
problems will disappear.

07:03.677 --> 07:05.099
The building is yours.

07:05.484 --> 07:06.455
Excellent!

07:07.593 --> 07:09.320
He's turned it into a prison!

07:22.041 --> 07:24.500
Prison guards wanted :
must know Powerpoint, sadism

07:24.555 --> 07:25.732
Let's see now.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.525
Barely finished high school.

07:27.722 --> 07:30.081
You've challenged me
to fight six times

07:30.278 --> 07:32.126
since the interview began...

07:32.341 --> 07:33.621
Make it seven!

07:35.840 --> 07:38.807
Mr. Simpson, I like the way
you go nuts over nothing.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.990
Now all you have to do
is pass this drug test.

07:57.484 --> 07:59.852
Cool, but I'll never pass
with this.

08:00.011 --> 08:01.459
I better switch samples.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.541
I haven't seen so many drugs
in a wang

08:11.708 --> 08:13.865
since I ran a Chinese opium den!

08:14.080 --> 08:16.614
"Crack, smack, uppers,
downers, outters, inners,

08:16.756 --> 08:19.673
"horse tranquilizers,
cow paralyzers, blue bombers,

08:19.841 --> 08:21.599
"green goofers,
yellow submarines,

08:21.756 --> 08:24.617
"LSD Mach 3,
and trace amounts of...

08:24.780 --> 08:26.707
human urine?"

08:26.916 --> 08:28.942
Well, there must have been
a mistake.

08:29.099 --> 08:30.963
My body is a temple.

08:34.087 --> 08:37.616
Guards, remove this coked-out
man-balloon from my sight!

08:38.524 --> 08:40.714
But he misread my pee!

08:40.984 --> 08:44.102
He misread my pee!

08:47.047 --> 08:48.302
We're not
overfeeding her.

08:48.476 --> 08:50.857
We've been giving her
this low-fat cat food!

08:55.111 --> 08:57.857
I'll bet she's sneaking food
from someplace else.

08:58.027 --> 08:59.156
Let's follow her!

08:59.343 --> 09:01.014
I'd rather follow the dog.

09:01.049 --> 09:02.495
I think he's up to something.

09:06.051 --> 09:07.745
One thing at a time, Bart.

09:21.032 --> 09:22.689
There you are, Smokey!

09:24.075 --> 09:26.940
Snowball II
has another family!

09:27.047 --> 09:29.691
This is worse than when we thought
Mom was having an affair.

09:29.846 --> 09:32.636
Turned out she was just
going to the library to cry.

09:32.670 --> 09:35.096
Now she just bottles up
her misery like a normal mom.

09:35.222 --> 09:37.325
Gentlemen, my prison is
losing money.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.039
We need more convicts
in the dungeonarium.

09:40.206 --> 09:41.871
Dungeonarium.
That's catchy.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.708
Uh, well, I could
beef up arrests

09:43.746 --> 09:46.454
by enforcing some of
these old forgotten laws.

09:48.769 --> 09:49.664
Okeydokey.

09:52.180 --> 09:53.237
Let's see here.

09:53.413 --> 09:55.036
Uh, here's one from 1834.

09:55.197 --> 09:59.407
"It's unlawful for a man to be
hatless during daylight hours."

10:04.221 --> 10:05.894
If I didn't arrest you
that night in the park,

10:06.053 --> 10:07.281
I'm not going
to arrest you now.

10:07.730 --> 10:12.128
Stupid prison guard jobs
thinks it's so big.

10:12.961 --> 10:15.207
Everyone gets a
prison job but me.

10:15.821 --> 10:17.673
All my best friends are guards.

10:18.379 --> 10:20.247
They think they're so cruel
and corrupt,

10:20.408 --> 10:21.515
but they're not.

10:21.931 --> 10:25.628
Okay, boys, here's a
loony law from 1911.

10:25.855 --> 10:27.671
"Five kicks of the same can

10:27.857 --> 10:30.897
shall be considered
illegally transporting litter."

10:37.574 --> 10:39.624
That's a hard five.
All units move in.

10:40.251 --> 10:42.420
We're puttin' you away,
Kicky Mantle.

10:42.568 --> 10:45.024
And give that can
the whole CSI treatment.

10:45.174 --> 10:47.270
You know, lab tests,
weird lights,

10:47.413 --> 10:49.375
shots from the can's
point of view.

10:51.315 --> 10:52.684
Yeah, that's it.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.761
Lots of flash and no meaning.

10:56.381 --> 10:58.804
Okay, new meat,
you're clean.

10:59.968 --> 11:01.621
I'm not supposed to be new meat.

11:01.796 --> 11:03.844
I'm supposed to have your job.

11:03.849 --> 11:06.392
I'm sick of you positing
an alternate reality!

11:14.906 --> 11:18.768
No  Frank Gehry-designed prison
can hold me!

11:26.606 --> 11:28.405
Oh, my God,
that man might be hurt!

11:28.422 --> 11:30.564
Guards,  there's
a prisoner in there!

11:35.296 --> 11:37.562
Nice nab, Simpson.

11:37.729 --> 11:40.325
You did the right thing
squealin' on that guy.

11:40.518 --> 11:41.784
Squealin'? No.

11:41.944 --> 11:43.141
I just wanted
to help him.

11:43.351 --> 11:44.367
Mm, whatever.

11:44.516 --> 11:47.164
How'd you like to
be a full-time rat?

11:47.314 --> 11:48.490
Really?

11:48.631 --> 11:50.709
You mean eat cheese,
gnaw through electrical cords,

11:50.874 --> 11:51.725
things like that?

11:54.234 --> 11:56.721
Not exactly.

11:56.869 --> 11:58.767
Mr. Burns, I've thought
about it,

11:58.924 --> 12:00.098
and I don't want to be a snitch.

12:00.257 --> 12:01.681
It's not an honorable life.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.843
Now,  now,
there are perks.

12:04.009 --> 12:05.549
A private cell,
extra dessert,

12:05.697 --> 12:07.357
and this adorable
little hat.

12:08.713 --> 12:10.661
Well, I am a sucker
for a little hat.

12:10.857 --> 12:12.462
So, we have
an agreement?

12:12.613 --> 12:14.449
Well... I don't know.

12:14.635 --> 12:17.394
But it's the only way
you'll survive in here.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.134
Well, I would like
to survive long enough

12:22.264 --> 12:23.807
to see the effects
of global warming.

12:23.966 --> 12:27.353
I've got an inside tip
that it's all a bunch of crap.

12:27.522 --> 12:29.874
Okay, you've found your snitch.

12:30.075 --> 12:31.108
Excellent!

12:31.284 --> 12:32.959
Now, what have
you got for me?

12:33.194 --> 12:36.424
Homer Simpson has become
a snitch.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.813
Tell me something I don't know.

12:38.980 --> 12:43.339
Sometimes
I go to movies alone.

12:47.379 --> 12:49.450
Say, is that a gang tattoo?

12:49.700 --> 12:50.953
I thought those weren't allowed.

12:51.203 --> 12:52.468
Yeah, it's a gang I was in as a kid.

12:52.718 --> 12:55.103
G.M.S.: Galactic Mystery Solvers.

12:55.353 --> 12:58.353
The only mystery we couldn't
solve was how not to grow up.

13:00.517 --> 13:01.106
That's right--

13:01.356 --> 13:02.850
an unauthorized tattoo.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.429
I came here right away.

13:04.679 --> 13:06.079
Very good.

13:08.200 --> 13:08.753
Here you go!

13:09.003 --> 13:12.550
42-inch plasma TV as a thank you from your...

13:12.800 --> 13:14.050
Your, mother.

13:14.718 --> 13:16.203
Oh, that "my mother."

13:16.453 --> 13:17.767
Tell him thanks.

13:18.017 --> 13:19.406
Okay, Tattoo Man.

13:19.656 --> 13:21.750
It's a month in the hole for you.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.229
Solitary confinement?

13:23.479 --> 13:25.450
But without my weekly canasta, I'll die.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.100
It's-it's my raison d'd're.

13:34.703 --> 13:37.950
Smokey, you've got that awful smell on you again.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.968
That's the smell of her real family!

13:40.218 --> 13:41.453
The Simpsons!

13:41.703 --> 13:43.367
And for your information, our walls have a bunch

13:43.617 --> 13:47.906
of dead raccoons in them, but we are
saving up the money to find them.

13:48.156 --> 13:48.750
Well, whatever.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.650
Smokey's our cat.

13:51.679 --> 13:53.029
Smokey, stay!

13:53.700 --> 13:54.950
Now back.

13:56.003 --> 13:56.750
Heel.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.268
Snowball does tricks?

13:58.318 --> 13:58.703
Sure.

13:58.953 --> 14:02.303
C'mon, Smokey, do your Smokey shuffle.

14:08.317 --> 14:09.406
Well, I don't care what you say.

14:09.656 --> 14:11.029
She still loves us more.

14:11.279 --> 14:14.279
Don't you, Snowball?

14:18.400 --> 14:22.400
You toyed with my heart like it was a toy heart.

14:25.003 --> 14:28.050
Gentlemen, we must determine
which of our fellow inmates

14:28.300 --> 14:31.568
has become the Rodentus Incarcerarium.

14:31.818 --> 14:32.603
You heard the boss.

14:32.853 --> 14:33.567
Find the rat.

14:33.817 --> 14:35.906
I found the rat, and he's right here.

14:36.156 --> 14:36.650
I ain't the rat;

14:36.900 --> 14:37.729
I'm the pigeon.

14:37.979 --> 14:38.950
I thought you was the mole.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.353
No, you're thinking of that
guy who was the canary.

14:41.603 --> 14:45.250
But we can all agree, we work in a
business with a very rich lexicon.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.550
Rich lexicon, very rich.

14:48.718 --> 14:50.618
A Tiffany's box!

14:51.003 --> 14:53.367
And the thing inside is from Tiffany's!

14:53.617 --> 14:55.106
Homie, you've never done this before.

14:55.356 --> 14:56.250
How'd you afford it?

14:56.500 --> 14:59.160
Well, if you really must know,

14:59.410 --> 15:01.950
I'm a prison snitch.

15:02.709 --> 15:06.450
Haven't you seen what happens to
people who rat in prison movies?

15:06.700 --> 15:07.953
Sure, they're on top of the world.

15:08.203 --> 15:10.050
Then there's a big riot scene.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.168
Then... I don't know.

15:11.418 --> 15:12.503
I usually doze off.

15:12.753 --> 15:14.367
The prison snitch is killed!

15:14.617 --> 15:15.806
And that could be you.

15:16.056 --> 15:18.856
Because you're the prison snitch!

15:20.000 --> 15:21.429
What are you dopes looking at?

15:21.679 --> 15:23.829
You've never seen bling-bling before?

15:24.100 --> 15:27.953
What is it they have that keeps
Snowball coming back to their house?

15:28.203 --> 15:30.203
Only one way to find out.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.768
My baby turtle crawled into your basement window.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.603
Oh, you poor boy.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.853
What's your turtle's name?

15:41.117 --> 15:42.006
Apron Boobs-face?

15:42.256 --> 15:43.329
Really?

15:43.579 --> 15:45.050
Well, let's go find it.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.950
And what's your name?

15:48.303 --> 15:51.303
Shoes... Butt-back?

15:58.500 --> 15:59.868
There's a jailbreak tonight.

16:00.118 --> 16:01.503
How come nobody told me before?

16:01.753 --> 16:02.967
I sent you an e-vite.

16:03.217 --> 16:04.256
You never responded.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.506
Nice netiquette, jerk.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.429
There's gonna be a breakout tonight.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.050
Very good.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.553
Now, I'd like a little more information.

16:14.803 --> 16:17.803
Are biographies arranged by author or subject?

16:21.100 --> 16:23.500
What is Bart still doing in there?

16:24.518 --> 16:26.103
You forgot to take some brownies.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.267
Thanks, Mother Dexter!

16:27.517 --> 16:28.346
I'll be back tomorrow.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.350
Bart, why were you in there so long?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.259
Lis, that place is great!

16:32.509 --> 16:33.750
They have a jukebox in the basement.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.050
And look at the trick they taught me!

16:38.903 --> 16:39.750
Are you watching?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Are you watching?

16:44.718 --> 16:46.403
When they come busting out, we'll be ready.

16:46.653 --> 16:49.267
Every single guard is outside waiting for them.

16:49.517 --> 16:51.106
Something don't feel right.

16:51.356 --> 16:55.850
Usually when there's a jailbreak,
there's electricity in the air,

16:56.100 --> 16:59.129
like the calm before a summer storm.

16:59.379 --> 17:01.050
Or, right before a heavyweight fight.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.950
Mine's more poetic.

17:04.002 --> 17:06.153
Now, where the hell are they?

17:07.300 --> 17:08.400
Kill the rat!

17:08.718 --> 17:09.818
Kill the rat!

17:10.653 --> 17:11.752
Kill the rat!

17:15.117 --> 17:16.967
What happened to the guards?!

17:17.979 --> 17:19.349
Okay, okay. Don't panic.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.300
Maybe they'll tire themselves
out with their chant.

17:28.099 --> 17:30.200
I call the balls of his feet!

17:35.818 --> 17:37.218
Marge, they're gonna kill me!

17:38.953 --> 17:41.367
I only did what I had to do to survive...

17:41.617 --> 17:44.117
in a style befitting a French monarch.

17:47.606 --> 17:49.306
Fly, Segway, fly!

17:56.600 --> 17:59.729
We've all heard of a laugh riot,
but a prison riot?

17:59.979 --> 18:03.950
Kent Brockman high above Montgomery Burns
State Penitentiary, where our expensive

18:04.200 --> 18:07.753
Thermocam 3000 is finally being used for something.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.350
This red glow is the heat from a pack of inmates

18:10.600 --> 18:13.268
who are desperately looking for
prison snitch, Homer Simpson--

18:13.518 --> 18:14.903
this massive blob over here--

18:15.153 --> 18:18.667
who is attempting to hide in the
kitchen a Good luck, blobby.

18:18.917 --> 18:21.417
Kill the rat! Then have snack!

18:22.656 --> 18:23.450
Homer.

18:23.700 --> 18:24.950
Homer, where are you?

18:25.879 --> 18:26.350
Marge!

18:26.600 --> 18:27.353
How did you get in here?

18:27.703 --> 18:31.250
As president of the cultural board,
I was given a key to the concert hall.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.268
There's the filthy rat we're gonna kill.

18:36.518 --> 18:40.103
And his wife, who sometimes
drives my son home from school.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.191
Oh, you must be Michael's dad!

18:42.441 --> 18:44.041
Marge, c'mon!

18:44.506 --> 18:46.556
We'll be safe in the gas chamber.

18:52.679 --> 18:55.050
I want you to look into the
faces of those poor men.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.550
Each one is a life you made
worse with your ratting.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.250
Marge, I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.868
Can I snitch on my heart and say I love you?

19:12.118 --> 19:14.118
Oh, Homie...

19:21.303 --> 19:23.303
Tear gas, my one weakness.

19:31.317 --> 19:32.817
You can come in, governor.

19:36.556 --> 19:38.909
Well, I'll make these rioters regret their folly.

19:39.209 --> 19:41.750
This prison will make Abu Ghraib
look like the Four Seasons.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.053
Smithers, we'll need electrical wire, a hood

19:44.303 --> 19:46.750
and someone who can really point at genitalia.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Done and done, sir.

19:52.018 --> 19:52.903
Hold on a minute.

19:53.153 --> 19:56.067
Governor, I've been using my
powers of snitching for evil,

19:56.317 --> 19:58.456
but now I want to tattle for good.

19:58.706 --> 20:00.050
This prison is a hellhole.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.659
They feed us horse meat,
with traces of jockey meat!

20:03.909 --> 20:07.009
I'll have you know I buy the finest cuts of beef.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.353
The guards are sadistic and cruel.

20:14.603 --> 20:15.950
I can't help the way I am.

20:16.200 --> 20:19.968
When I was a boy, I saw my father
murdered before my eyes.

20:20.618 --> 20:21.153
By me.

20:21.203 --> 20:26.907
Governor, I think the only fair solution
is to pardon all these thugs and murderers.

20:27.157 --> 20:29.756
Well, since there's no room
in the prisons you came from,

20:30.006 --> 20:33.450
I'm releasing you all to a garbage barge,
where you will bare-knuckle-box

20:33.700 --> 20:36.750
till  one of you emerges as
king of your floating hell.

20:39.109 --> 20:40.753
You know what I missed in the joint?

20:41.003 --> 20:43.850
Just lying here watching you sleeping sweetly.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.568
Sleeping sweetly.

20:46.918 --> 20:49.468
Sleeping sweetly...

20:56.153 --> 20:58.003
I won't tell if you don't tell.

21:03.617 --> 21:04.256
Listen to me!

21:04.506 --> 21:06.150
This whole building is unsafe.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.829
They cut corners everywhere.

21:08.079 --> 21:10.250
People! It's a deathtrap.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.053
No, Dad,

21:11.303 --> 21:15.050
you fell asleep in front of the TV,
watching The Towering Inferno.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.800
How do you know the title
of my prophetic vision?
