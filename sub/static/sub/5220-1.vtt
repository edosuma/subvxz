01:31.790 --> 01:35.094
-You're back!
-Yeah, took the short route.

01:37.430 --> 01:41.768
This is the most god-awful
boring post I've ever had.

01:41.803 --> 01:44.204
I'd kill you just
for something to do.

01:44.239 --> 01:47.673
-What?
-Just kidding. Mostly.

01:50.376 --> 01:53.278
What's up?
What do you mean?

01:53.313 --> 01:55.781
You look like a kid with
your hand in the cookie jar.

01:58.183 --> 02:03.122
You didn't.
Bring her out.

02:07.025 --> 02:08.960
Hi.

02:08.995 --> 02:10.327
Gary, you idiot,
if the boss knew

02:10.362 --> 02:12.532
you brought a girl out
here, she'd skin you alive.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.134
You're not gonna
tell her, are you?

02:14.169 --> 02:15.999
Give me one good reason.

02:16.034 --> 02:18.871
Easy. I brought
one for you too.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.773
No, no no.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.473
Hey, Gary.

02:22.508 --> 02:25.344
Come on, Tyler.
There's nobody around.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.511
We're guarding an empty lake.

02:27.546 --> 02:30.282
Besides, me and Tracy
haven't seen each other

02:30.317 --> 02:31.817
in almost a week.

02:34.287 --> 02:37.172
Maybe we should go.
No!

02:37.207 --> 02:40.058
We just want
to have some fun.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.328
Alright, go ahead.

02:44.796 --> 02:46.264
Aren't you coming?

02:46.299 --> 02:49.801
Somebody's got
to mind the store.

02:49.836 --> 02:53.873
Look, if this is gonna get
you into trouble, we'll leave.

02:53.908 --> 02:58.041
Na, it's alright.

02:58.076 --> 03:02.097
Aren't you going
to go with them?

03:02.132 --> 03:06.118
-Three's a crowd
-Yeah. Coffee?

03:17.263 --> 03:18.629
You come over here.

03:18.664 --> 03:20.265
It's time for you to take
some of your medicine.

03:20.300 --> 03:24.736
You're not the boss
of me. I'm Tyson!

03:24.771 --> 03:26.805
Tyler.

03:26.806 --> 03:30.675
What'd I tell you,
bro? Best idea ever.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.814
I gotta tell you Gare, when
you're right you're right.

03:34.849 --> 03:37.917
And brother, you're right.

03:37.952 --> 03:42.787
Gary.

03:42.822 --> 03:46.058
Don't worry, this
place is deserted.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.158
Nobody ever comes here.

03:48.193 --> 03:51.597
Besides, who's going to get
me in trouble, my supervisor?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.540
-You know what?
-What?

04:03.575 --> 04:07.112
-It's hot in here.
-You got that right.

04:07.147 --> 04:10.717
No, I mean let's
get out of here.

04:10.752 --> 04:11.915
You know I'm on the clock.

04:11.950 --> 04:15.003
I can't just up and
leave the island.

04:15.038 --> 04:18.057
Well then, let's
go under the stars then.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.690
What do you think, Gare?

04:19.725 --> 04:21.394
Can you handle
things without me?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.362
Yeah. I got her covered.

04:35.774 --> 04:37.776
Your romantic
evening awaits, my dear.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.409
Such a gentleman!

04:39.444 --> 04:42.247
Why can't you be a
gentleman like him?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.983
Cuz you don't like gentlemen.

04:44.018 --> 04:47.453
Yeah!

05:21.987 --> 05:24.490
I guess, there?

05:30.362 --> 05:33.231
Come on, lay down with me.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.066
That water sure looks nice.

05:36.101 --> 05:39.671
You look nice. Why
not come lie down with me?

05:39.672 --> 05:42.442
No, I think I
wanna go for a swim.

05:42.507 --> 05:46.579
A swim? But I brought bubbly
and a blanket and everything.

05:51.817 --> 05:54.319
I'm sorry, what?

05:57.023 --> 05:59.258
Come on, come for a swim!

06:01.093 --> 06:03.963
Gary...

06:14.774 --> 06:16.608
Wait for me!

06:21.079 --> 06:23.415
You know, this isn't
so bad after all.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.792
See, a woman knows best.

06:35.827 --> 06:38.096
And if you're the kind
of guy I think you are

06:38.131 --> 06:40.500
you'll recognize I'm boss.

06:45.437 --> 06:46.639
Ungh!

06:52.144 --> 06:54.813
You see, this is what
I'm talking about!

06:57.483 --> 06:59.819
Quit messing around!

07:02.822 --> 07:06.625
My horoscope was right,
you're no good for me.

07:10.495 --> 07:15.133
Did you hear that?
You're no good for me!

07:16.935 --> 07:21.106
If you don't show yourself in
five seconds we're through!

07:21.107 --> 07:26.112
One... two... three...

07:29.148 --> 07:31.551
It's about time
you smartened up.

07:37.414 --> 07:42.414
RAIDERS OF THE LOST SHARK

07:43.167 --> 07:46.667
Subrip: Pix

09:57.296 --> 09:59.564
I'm sorry that we're
boring you, Steven.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.301
No not at all, Professor
Reynolds. I was just...

10:02.336 --> 10:05.003
Having a dream? Well,
welcome back to reality.

10:05.004 --> 10:08.240
-Sorry.
-Apology accepted.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.974
Let's continue.

10:10.009 --> 10:12.345
The megaladon was as species
of shark that originated

10:12.380 --> 10:15.412
approximately
28 million years ago.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.933
The sheer size of this
beast was staggering.

10:18.968 --> 10:22.420
In some cases, up to and
over 60 feet in length.

10:22.421 --> 10:25.022
-Professor Reynolds?
-Yes, Kim?

10:25.057 --> 10:28.326
You said the shark originated
up to 28 million years ago?

10:28.361 --> 10:29.826
That's right.

10:29.861 --> 10:32.597
Well I was just wondering,
when did it become extinct?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.366
There's speculation
that the creature died off

10:34.401 --> 10:36.836
about 1.5 million years ago.

10:38.136 --> 10:39.638
Speculation?

10:39.639 --> 10:43.209
You don't think that this
could still exist, do you?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.715
Professor Reynolds?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.883
Sorry May. What
was your questions?

10:52.918 --> 10:54.419
I was just wondering
about your thoughts

10:54.454 --> 10:56.219
on the megaladon's extinction.

10:56.254 --> 10:57.622
Do you think that
something like this

10:57.657 --> 10:59.557
could still exist without
us knowing about it?

10:59.592 --> 11:01.593
What about other
prehistoric sea life?

11:01.594 --> 11:03.561
We know more about
the surface of the moon

11:03.596 --> 11:06.631
than we do about the depths
of the oceans and the seas.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.535
Reports of "submarine",
a 55 plus foot shark

11:10.570 --> 11:12.604
feeding off the
coast of South Africa

11:12.605 --> 11:15.206
are still being claimed today.

11:15.241 --> 11:17.009
That's a big shark.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.743
We've only just begun.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.713
Tales of giant squid and octopus

11:20.748 --> 11:22.613
have been reported for years

11:22.648 --> 11:24.983
but only within the last
year have we actually

11:25.018 --> 11:27.283
been able to record a
colossal squid in the wild.

11:27.318 --> 11:30.822
We've only explored 5% of
what the oceans have to offer

11:30.857 --> 11:32.824
and I don't think we
should close our minds

11:32.825 --> 11:35.191
to the possibility
that maybe this,

11:35.226 --> 11:37.529
or other prehistoric creatures,
could still exist today.

11:39.798 --> 11:41.966
So, just because my speech took
up the majority of the class

11:42.001 --> 11:44.420
does not mean that
the work falls behind.

11:44.455 --> 11:46.781
I expect you all to read
chapters 5 through 7

11:46.816 --> 11:49.108
for the next class and
write down what creatures

11:49.143 --> 11:51.676
you think may still
be alive today.

11:51.677 --> 11:54.763
Take into consideration
climate and food chain.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.849
I look forward to reading
your responses on Monday.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.952
Thank you everyone and
have a great weekend.

12:27.413 --> 12:31.182
Gary, I don't see anything.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.686
Do you have to yell so loud?

12:37.155 --> 12:39.907
Geez, I think I drank too much.

12:39.942 --> 12:42.335
What are you
yelling at me for?

12:42.370 --> 12:44.729
For the love of
all that is holy

12:44.730 --> 12:48.431
my head is about to explode!

12:48.466 --> 12:52.904
Listen, Tyler and
Sarah never came back.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.374
I need to get him
back to his post

12:55.409 --> 12:58.244
before the next shift arrives.

12:58.279 --> 13:01.579
Why is the sun so bright?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.450
We'll have a science
lesson another time.

13:04.485 --> 13:07.253
You're an ass!

13:08.453 --> 13:11.489
Hey look, over there!

13:13.024 --> 13:15.394
Check this out.

13:16.828 --> 13:18.863
It doesn't match
what I'm wearing.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.864
No, it's what
Tyler was wearing.

13:20.899 --> 13:25.904
-You know what I think?
-What's that?

13:25.971 --> 13:28.239
They probably finished off

13:28.274 --> 13:31.777
a nice, romantic night
in each other's arms.

13:34.613 --> 13:37.614
Clearly, they're nude

13:37.649 --> 13:42.187
and I don't feel like rudely
waking up naked people.

13:42.222 --> 13:45.790
I suppose I can't
argue with that.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.860
You know what I do feel like?

13:47.895 --> 13:49.192
What?

13:49.227 --> 13:53.064
I'm going to freshen
up in the lake.

14:01.639 --> 14:03.141
Mama.

14:33.239 --> 14:36.041
You should come in
here, the water's amazing!

14:36.076 --> 14:38.277
Best cure for a hangover!

14:38.312 --> 14:40.511
I'm good, thanks.

14:40.546 --> 14:45.517
So much for my big,
brave security guard boyfriend.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.084
I'm not scared of the water

14:47.119 --> 14:49.053
I just don't feel like
swimming right now.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.120
Who are you trying to kid?

14:51.155 --> 14:55.627
Kid, nothing. I'm just
a dry-ground kinda guy

14:55.628 --> 14:57.663
in the morning, that's all.

14:57.698 --> 15:00.049
Nice try, chicken!

15:00.084 --> 15:02.365
So I'm a chicken, now?

15:02.400 --> 15:06.771
A big chicken! A big
old hungover chicken!

15:06.772 --> 15:08.307
You know when you
get back on dry ground

15:08.342 --> 15:09.774
you're gonna get it, right?

15:12.711 --> 15:14.279
I'm not the one
who's a big fat...

15:15.681 --> 15:17.516
Tracy!

15:27.659 --> 15:29.227
Tracy!

15:35.466 --> 15:38.670
Tracy, where are you?

15:39.837 --> 15:44.842
Tracy! Where are you?

15:48.813 --> 15:51.516
Where the hell...
where the hell am I?

15:51.517 --> 15:54.052
I gotta get out of here.

16:02.794 --> 16:05.296
So you guys want to go to
Spaz's party tonight or what?

16:05.297 --> 16:06.463
I don't know, Steve.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.132
Spaz's parties get
pretty out of control.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.819
Yeah, that's why we should
all go. It'll be a riot.

16:10.854 --> 16:13.471
To be honest, I'm not a huge
fan of Spaz to begin with.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.558
Why not?
Cuz he's a spaz, maybe?

16:16.593 --> 16:19.610
Ok, so what do you
guys want to do tonight?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.378
Any bright ideas?

16:21.413 --> 16:22.981
Isn't Wiener having a party?

16:23.016 --> 16:24.748
Even worse.

16:24.783 --> 16:26.918
What was up with
Professor Reynolds today?

16:26.953 --> 16:28.484
She seemed really out of it.

16:28.519 --> 16:30.988
Like, she drifted
off five times.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.091
She probably just needs a
weekend of rest and relaxation.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.091
Works for me
whenever I tune out.

16:35.126 --> 16:37.195
Yeah, you must get
a lot of rest then.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.796
Shut up!

16:38.831 --> 16:41.583
No seriously, did some
stuff happen to her?

16:41.618 --> 16:44.336
Like, bad stuff when
she was a kid, maybe?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.170
I bet it was the island.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.474
Yeah, I heard about it
when I was in high school.

16:48.509 --> 16:49.742
She and some friends
went out to this island

16:49.777 --> 16:51.644
and stuff got all messed up.

16:51.679 --> 16:53.476
Yeah, I heard about that.

16:53.511 --> 16:55.179
I just didn't know
Reynolds was involved.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.115
Yeah, she was
the only survivor.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.017
-Knock it off.
-Wait, what?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.619
Come on, you have to
fill me in on this.

17:00.654 --> 17:02.152
The only survivor?

17:02.187 --> 17:04.705
Fill us, I want to
hear this story too.

17:04.741 --> 17:07.191
Ok, so here's what
I heard happened:

17:07.226 --> 17:09.560
Apparently there's this
company out on Murphy's Island

17:09.596 --> 17:11.561
doing some research
or something.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.999
Word is, something
happened there.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.518
Something terrible.

17:15.553 --> 17:16.965
Come on, really?

17:17.001 --> 17:19.020
Well, not like a curse
or anything, but her sister

17:19.055 --> 17:21.039
got killed and so did a bunch
of people working there.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.473
She was the only survivor

17:22.508 --> 17:24.406
and she hasn't been
the same since.

17:24.442 --> 17:26.810
That's insane, I wonder
what could have done it.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.479
Judging by the
way she was today

17:28.480 --> 17:30.214
it was probably some
big-ass shark or something.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.782
Whatever.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.184
That's what we should do!

17:33.219 --> 17:34.552
What's that?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.688
We should totally check
out Murphy's Island!

17:36.723 --> 17:39.622
Didn't I just tell you?

17:39.657 --> 17:42.091
I don't know, it kind
of sounds exciting.

17:42.126 --> 17:44.562
Kim, not you! I thought
you'd be cool about this.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.999
You don't really believe
all that nonsense, do you?

17:47.034 --> 17:49.018
No no, it's ok, maybe
we'll find Bigfoot

17:49.053 --> 17:50.967
and he can help us
row to the island.

17:51.002 --> 17:53.137
Or we could just ride the
Loch Ness monster there!

17:54.306 --> 17:55.540
So are you
coming, May or what?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.175
Are you scared?

17:58.210 --> 18:00.245
Come on, you really think
that's going to work on me?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.530
I'm counting on it.

18:01.565 --> 18:02.907
Well,
you are correct.

18:02.942 --> 18:04.214
You can count me in, guys.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.351
Awesome! Looks like it's
gonna be an adventure weekend.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.986
Just Steven and the ladies.

18:08.051 --> 18:09.053
No.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.553
Anyone got a microbus?

18:10.588 --> 18:13.558
This is going
to be so awesome!

18:16.862 --> 18:20.865
Rachel. You're right,
the guardhouse is empty.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.901
If those bozos ducked
out early again...

18:22.936 --> 18:24.303
They didn't.

18:24.338 --> 18:25.671
How do you know?

18:28.339 --> 18:30.641
Crap, they didn't.
They did.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.444
-Dumbass!
-For sure.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.780
Dragon Lady is going to
want to know about this.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.515
You have to call it in.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.852
Don't let her hear
you call her that.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.159
Patch me through to the
boss, please. Code Red.

18:49.193 --> 18:51.562
Ma'am, your worst fears
have been confirmed.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.415
Both of them?

18:53.450 --> 18:55.426
Yes, ma'am.

18:55.461 --> 18:57.065
Those idiots!

18:57.100 --> 18:58.635
Yes, ma'am.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.206
I told them to stay
away from the water!

19:01.241 --> 19:04.073
It gets worse.

19:04.108 --> 19:09.114
How can it
possibly get any worse?

19:09.180 --> 19:11.817
It looks like they had dates.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.387
Ma'am?

19:17.422 --> 19:19.825
Ma'am, what would
you like us to do?

19:19.860 --> 19:21.992
Collect all the evidence.

19:22.027 --> 19:23.795
The geeks may find
something in that mess

19:23.830 --> 19:25.898
and bring it all back here.

19:25.933 --> 19:28.366
Understood.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.470
Well, what did she say?

19:33.505 --> 19:34.773
She wants you to
collect all the evidence

19:34.808 --> 19:36.407
while I check the perimeter.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.074
Really? How?

19:38.109 --> 19:39.844
I don't know, grab
some garbage bags

19:39.845 --> 19:41.446
from the guardhouse
or something.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.347
Snap to it!

19:52.857 --> 19:54.809
Laura!
What?

19:54.844 --> 19:56.761
-What's that?
-Where?

19:56.796 --> 19:58.429
There!

19:59.198 --> 20:02.000
My god, there's
somebody alive out there!

20:02.035 --> 20:04.802
We've got to get him
out of the water!

20:04.868 --> 20:07.872
Get out of the
water, it's not safe!

20:08.740 --> 20:10.742
-Where did he go?
-He was just there!

20:10.777 --> 20:12.744
You're going to have
to go in and check.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.579
-What?
-Go in and check.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.946
He's gone!

20:16.981 --> 20:19.448
There he is! Go!

20:19.483 --> 20:22.620
We're sending someone
out to save you!

20:23.521 --> 20:25.289
Dammit

20:38.470 --> 20:41.673
Don't worry, buddy. Hold on.

20:57.288 --> 21:01.727
Hey, where the hell did you go?

21:12.237 --> 21:15.071
What the hell!?

21:15.106 --> 21:18.309
Where's the rest of you?!

21:19.810 --> 21:23.914
Fake! He was using a fake!

21:52.344 --> 21:55.078
-Janet?
-Hello, Carly.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.949
Or do we go by Professor
Reynolds these days?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.085
Carly's fine. What are you...

22:00.120 --> 22:02.104
I mean, why are you here?

22:02.139 --> 22:04.348
It's about the island.

22:04.383 --> 22:06.522
The island. What about it?

22:06.557 --> 22:09.027
I haven't spoken to or
said anything to anyone.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.595
I know, I know. Relax, Carly.

22:11.630 --> 22:15.434
And as long as it stays that
way, we'll be just fine.

22:15.469 --> 22:17.967
I'm here for business.

22:18.002 --> 22:20.404
We're in need of your expertise.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.138
My expertise?

22:22.173 --> 22:25.242
Yes. You know what.

22:35.053 --> 22:37.089
Captain? Captain, wake up!

22:37.124 --> 22:38.823
What? What the hell?

22:38.824 --> 22:40.490
Captain, we just got a call

22:40.525 --> 22:41.959
that might be of
interest to you.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.394
You show me the
respect I am due.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.361
You call me sheriff.

22:45.396 --> 22:48.332
But captain, first
of all, this is Canada

22:48.333 --> 22:51.702
we don't have sheriffs
up here, and secondly...

22:51.737 --> 22:53.936
Secondly, you call me sheriff

22:53.971 --> 22:55.906
or you will no
longer be my deputy,

22:55.941 --> 22:58.875
you'll go back to being
simply my brother-in-law.

22:58.910 --> 23:02.080
Don't forget this post is a
favor to my wife, after all.

23:02.115 --> 23:05.983
Sheriff,
sheriff, we just got a call

23:06.018 --> 23:07.418
that might interest you.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.418
That's more like
it. What kind of call?

23:09.453 --> 23:13.022
Apparently, a pair of
townies have gone missing.

23:13.057 --> 23:16.862
We just got a pair of frantic
phone calls from their parents

23:16.897 --> 23:18.427
Townies?

23:18.462 --> 23:20.530
A couple of women
from down at the tavern.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.999
Apparently, they were going
to hang out with these fellas

23:24.034 --> 23:27.004
and have a party but
they never came home.

23:27.005 --> 23:30.909
Great. I bet they just
can't hold their liquor.

23:30.944 --> 23:32.745
I'm sure we'll
find them sleeping

23:32.780 --> 23:34.546
in a car at the
side of the road.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.945
Apparently one of the ladies

23:35.980 --> 23:38.884
is dating a guard that
works down at the island.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.502
Well, if they
ended up there

23:40.537 --> 23:42.051
it's the Dragon Lady's problem.

23:42.086 --> 23:44.288
She has her own security
force, let them deal with it.

23:44.323 --> 23:47.191
But captain, sheriff...

23:47.226 --> 23:50.025
I'll tell you what we do:

23:50.060 --> 23:52.364
you go make a few phone
calls, see if the girls

23:52.399 --> 23:54.430
ended up at any of
their friend's houses.

23:54.465 --> 23:57.034
I'm going to sit back,
put my feet up on my desk

23:57.035 --> 24:00.005
and read the National Geographic
just for the pictures.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.705
Do you catch my drift?

24:02.740 --> 24:05.509
I hear you loud
and clear, sheriff.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.511
Attaboy.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.669
So is this where
seaweed is born?

24:32.336 --> 24:33.838
You guys got
everything you need?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.405
I think we're good.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.309
So this guy, we're just
supposed to meet him here?

24:38.344 --> 24:40.543
Who's this, and the what now?

24:40.578 --> 24:43.147
I kinda charted a boat
to take us to the island.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.582
How in the hell?

24:44.583 --> 24:46.148
I just let my
fingers do the walking

24:46.183 --> 24:48.584
and called the guy
who charters his boat.

24:48.619 --> 24:50.321
He sounds like a crusty
old seaman on the phone

24:50.356 --> 24:52.323
but he's got a boat
and he promised

24:52.324 --> 24:53.991
to take us to the island.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.224
This is crazy.

24:55.259 --> 24:56.927
They're going to hear us
coming from miles away.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.093
Don't sweat it.

24:58.128 --> 25:00.447
With our luck, it'll
probably be a row boat.

25:00.482 --> 25:02.766
That is not cool, man.
I am not rowing a boat.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.603
I'm not
doing any rowing either.

25:04.638 --> 25:06.002
Come on, guys. Let's move.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.538
I said we'd meet him
down by the docks.

25:07.573 --> 25:08.906
Alright.

25:12.810 --> 25:14.878
So, let me
understand this correctly.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.481
You're telling me there's a
killer shark on the loose.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.218
Well, we're not sure
yet, but if there is

25:20.253 --> 25:22.920
we'll need someone
with your skill set.

25:22.921 --> 25:27.625
So we figured, rather than
start again with someone new

25:27.660 --> 25:29.192
You want someone who's seen

25:29.227 --> 25:31.561
or killed one of these
before, am I right?

25:31.596 --> 25:33.562
Well, in maybe
less colorful words, yes.

25:33.597 --> 25:36.835
But there's a lot more to this
than just finding a shark.

25:36.870 --> 25:39.802
What else could there be?

25:39.837 --> 25:43.173
So far you haven't exactly
sold me on this idea.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.573
What if I were to
tell you that there

25:44.608 --> 25:48.645
is a somewhat prehistoric
element to all of this?

25:48.680 --> 25:52.683
I'd tell you you're
watching too many bad movies.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.952
I'm dead serious
about this, Carly!

25:55.987 --> 26:00.926
A week ago, we discovered an
underwater cave while drilling.

26:02.326 --> 26:04.093
A cave?

26:04.128 --> 26:08.130
Yes, a cave,
which we now believe

26:08.165 --> 26:12.037
had remained untouched
for thousands of years.

26:12.072 --> 26:14.204
Go on.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.674
Anyway, something got out.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.278
I don't like
where this is going.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.279
We sent a couple of divers in

26:22.314 --> 26:25.584
to examine the cave
after the drilling

26:25.619 --> 26:27.852
and they never came out.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.119
Go on.

26:30.154 --> 26:33.591
More recently, some
of our security guards

26:33.592 --> 26:38.597
went missing after swimming
in the lake, presumed dead.

26:39.530 --> 26:41.765
Goddammit!

26:41.766 --> 26:44.400
How do I put this?

26:44.435 --> 26:49.441
I think we released
a killer shark.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.641
Dammit, Janet, you
continue to drill

26:52.676 --> 26:56.080
in that lake even after
what happened to my sister?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.379
We figured it was a long shot

26:57.414 --> 26:59.317
that something like
this would happen again.

26:59.352 --> 27:01.752
Well, you rolled
the dice and lost.

27:01.787 --> 27:05.255
Will you help me?

27:05.256 --> 27:07.791
What do you want me to do?

27:07.826 --> 27:11.363
Identify the problem
for sure, to start with.

27:11.398 --> 27:14.030
If it isn't a shark,
we need to know.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.533
And if it is, you need
to tell us what to do

27:15.568 --> 27:17.801
to get rid of it.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.704
I don't know about this.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.711
I know this must be difficult,
but we really need you.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.831
I know, it's just that...

27:29.866 --> 27:32.917
I'm sorry about your sister.

27:32.952 --> 27:36.453
I know this is hard.

27:55.707 --> 27:58.375
Are you Captain Stubing?

27:58.410 --> 28:02.378
It's Steuben. Captain Steuben.

28:02.413 --> 28:05.016
What can I do for
you, young lady?

28:05.051 --> 28:07.619
I'm May. I'm your
charter for today.

28:07.654 --> 28:09.852
We spoke on the phone earlier?

28:09.887 --> 28:12.473
So you're the one
that wants to go

28:12.508 --> 28:15.051
to the forbidden island, are ya?

28:15.086 --> 28:17.875
I guess so. Why
is it forbidden?

28:17.910 --> 28:21.189
It's all because
of the shark, miss.

28:21.224 --> 28:24.434
These sharks aren't
like normal sharks.

28:24.469 --> 28:29.474
These sharks are filled
with hate and piss and fire.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.579
Look Captain, I don't
believe these bogus stories

28:34.614 --> 28:37.032
about dino-sharks or whatever
they're supposed to be.

28:37.067 --> 28:39.416
I've studied sharks and
they can't possibly hate.

28:39.451 --> 28:42.120
They're creatures of habit
and instinct and that's it.

28:42.155 --> 28:45.122
Let me tell ya
something about sharks

28:45.123 --> 28:48.625
you can't read about in
any books, young lady.

28:48.660 --> 28:52.494
These sharks, they can hunt.

28:52.529 --> 28:57.535
They can reason
and they can kill

28:58.403 --> 29:02.941
with a vengeance
in their hearts.

29:07.077 --> 29:12.083
It was a shark
that took my hand.

29:14.618 --> 29:18.856
But you still have
both of your hands.

29:20.858 --> 29:25.864
This
isn't my hand!

29:31.469 --> 29:34.972
Can we get going now, or...?

29:40.612 --> 29:43.181
So what exactly do
you expect me to do?

29:43.216 --> 29:45.247
All in due time.

29:45.282 --> 29:46.850
It was great
catching up with you.

29:46.851 --> 29:48.820
I'm glad you're doing so well.

29:48.855 --> 29:51.121
Yeah, I guess.

29:52.523 --> 29:56.226
Let's get the formalities
out of the way first, shall we?

29:57.261 --> 29:58.861
Sure.

29:58.896 --> 30:01.131
These are pretty
straightforward.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.801
You're simply
signing that you will

30:03.836 --> 30:06.821
in no way discuss
what goes on here.

30:06.856 --> 30:09.772
What exactly am I
getting myself into?

30:09.807 --> 30:14.345
You simply sign and we
pay you to keep quiet.

30:20.050 --> 30:23.153
Good. Let's get
started, shall we?

32:03.354 --> 32:06.688
# Baby you're tryin to
hurt me when I'm down

32:06.723 --> 32:10.477
# And baby you know my
heart's been kicked around

32:10.512 --> 32:14.231
# Well too much of you is
what's been getting to me

32:14.266 --> 32:18.135
# And I don't want
to hear you're sorry

32:18.170 --> 32:20.021
# Well I can't stand it

32:20.056 --> 32:21.872
# Frustration makes me blue

32:21.873 --> 32:25.609
# But I'm so glad I'm
getting rid of you

32:25.644 --> 32:29.311
# I've taken all I
can take from you

32:29.346 --> 32:32.948
# Baby you lied and
you took me for a ride

32:32.983 --> 32:36.853
# Well I can't tell ya
how much that hurt inside

32:36.854 --> 32:40.557
# Well if I can't take it
there's one thing I can do

32:40.592 --> 32:44.295
# And I will start
by getting rid of you

32:44.330 --> 32:47.964
# I've taken all I
can take from you

32:47.999 --> 32:50.000
# Chains been bringing
me all the way down

32:50.035 --> 32:51.967
# You know there
ain't nothin I can do

32:52.002 --> 32:54.304
# But if there's one thing
that makes me feel better

32:54.305 --> 32:56.341
# It's to know that
I am rid of you

32:56.376 --> 32:59.476
# I'm getting rid of you

32:59.477 --> 33:02.013
# It's all that I can do #

35:13.543 --> 35:15.212
Sheriff! More news!

35:15.213 --> 35:17.613
What, is
this about the townies?

35:17.648 --> 35:19.633
No, sir. This is
about some tourists.

35:19.668 --> 35:22.161
Well I certainly
hope it was worth

35:22.196 --> 35:24.655
interrupting my
mid-afternoon nap.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.423
A couple visiting from Quebec.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.044
The husband claims that
the wife was killed.

35:30.079 --> 35:32.595
Please tell me he
confessed so that we can

35:32.630 --> 35:36.467
just slap the cuffs on him and
be home in time for Jeopardy.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.737
He says she was
killed by a shark.

35:39.772 --> 35:42.137
-A shark?!
-A shark.

35:42.172 --> 35:45.108
Where was the couple
when this shark attacked?

35:45.143 --> 35:47.444
McDonald's Landing.

35:47.445 --> 35:48.977
Near the island.

35:49.012 --> 35:50.815
Why do you always
call it an island?

35:50.850 --> 35:52.634
Technically, it's a peninsula.

35:52.669 --> 35:54.383
Either way, I have a feeling

35:54.418 --> 35:56.787
we've got a lot of
bad coming our way.

35:56.822 --> 36:00.323
I'll put some coffee on.

36:00.324 --> 36:03.293
You do that,
deputy. You do that.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.215
So what we need to do
is get you to the island

36:24.250 --> 36:27.485
and see if we can
identify the problem.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.087
Loud noises work well.

36:29.122 --> 36:30.620
I beg your pardon?

36:30.655 --> 36:32.555
Loud noises, like explosives.

36:32.590 --> 36:35.358
It could bring whatever's in
the water up to the surface.

36:35.393 --> 36:37.694
Perfect!

36:37.695 --> 36:40.531
But hold on a second,
I'm not a shark hunter.

36:40.566 --> 36:43.367
I'm a fish expert who
knows a little bit about...

36:43.402 --> 36:46.035
Think of it as an adventure.

36:46.070 --> 36:48.706
Besides, we're not even
sure that it's a shark.

36:48.741 --> 36:51.142
Come on, this way.

37:01.018 --> 37:02.551
What is this place?

37:02.586 --> 37:06.690
This is Rodney. He
monitors, well everything.

37:09.092 --> 37:12.429
Is that the island?

37:13.431 --> 37:16.399
Yeah that's...

37:16.434 --> 37:20.304
Yes, it is. And that's why
we keep him in this room.

37:22.039 --> 37:24.408
Can you pause that
screen right there?

37:24.443 --> 37:26.575
What do we have here?

37:26.610 --> 37:31.615
Where is that? Are
they going to the island?

37:31.681 --> 37:33.917
No no, they aren't going,

37:33.918 --> 37:37.488
that's not on the island,
that's on, that's on,

37:38.722 --> 37:40.455
Where the hell is it?

37:40.490 --> 37:42.642
That's on the
other side, madam.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.795
I suppose they'd
be going there.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.796
Thank you.

37:46.831 --> 37:48.099
I hope they aren't
planning on doing

37:48.134 --> 37:50.151
what it looks like they're doing

37:50.186 --> 37:53.679
with all this shark nonsense.

37:53.714 --> 37:57.173
My god, those
are my students.

37:57.239 --> 38:01.711
Live bait.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.130
So, I don't mean to sound
like an impatient child...

38:20.165 --> 38:22.583
Then don't say it.

38:22.618 --> 38:24.966
But are we there yet?

38:25.001 --> 38:27.137
Kimberly, can you just
enjoy the relaxing boat ride?

38:27.172 --> 38:29.557
The sun is shining,
the birds are chirping

38:29.592 --> 38:31.942
and old geezers are
free to walk outside.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.012
Present company
excluded, of course.

38:38.148 --> 38:40.615
I like walking.

38:40.650 --> 38:42.117
Yeah Kim, just chill.

38:42.152 --> 38:44.254
-Yeah.
-Sorry.

38:44.255 --> 38:47.824
I just get a little bit
uneasy when I'm in the middle

38:47.859 --> 38:51.394
of a huge body of water and
I'm nowhere near the shore.

38:51.429 --> 38:54.498
I sure hope the
captain's smarter than he looks.

38:54.533 --> 38:57.001
You
and me both, sister.

38:58.802 --> 39:01.739
Anybody want a bag
of complimentary nuts?

39:04.007 --> 39:06.210
Yar.

39:11.681 --> 39:14.284
Come on
let's go, let's go!

39:14.319 --> 39:16.818
What's the big deal?

39:16.853 --> 39:19.672
When you've seen one beach,
you've seen them all.

39:19.707 --> 39:22.492
Easy for you to say, I
had to work days all summer.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.228
I didn't get to go to the beach.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.365
What are you doing?

39:28.400 --> 39:29.866
I'm going swimming.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.869
What did you think I was
going to do at the beach?

39:31.904 --> 39:33.769
Maybe take a walk?

39:33.804 --> 39:37.141
You're not going in there,
that water's freezing.

39:37.176 --> 39:39.510
I'm totally
going in the water.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.176
Whatever.

39:41.211 --> 39:43.280
Come one, it'll be
fun! It'll be fun.

39:45.615 --> 39:47.750
I'm not getting in there.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.886
Come on, don't be a wimp.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.854
Me, a wimp?

39:52.889 --> 39:56.192
What's the problem, tough guy?

39:56.193 --> 40:01.132
The problem is,
I'm like 1% body fat.

40:03.601 --> 40:05.635
My body doesn't
agree with the cold.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.570
I'll freeze!

40:07.605 --> 40:09.806
Whatever, I'm going in.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.008
What about the fish?

40:12.009 --> 40:14.008
What about the fish?

40:14.043 --> 40:15.413
You know those little
bastards that nip you

40:15.448 --> 40:17.680
at your toes in the water?

40:17.715 --> 40:19.784
What's the point of
having all that muscle

40:19.819 --> 40:22.552
if you're afraid
of fish and water?

40:22.587 --> 40:24.486
I'm not afraid of fish.

40:24.521 --> 40:26.321
I just said I didn't like them.

40:26.356 --> 40:29.259
Come on, what have
fish ever done to you?

40:33.063 --> 40:36.083
Flying shark?

40:36.118 --> 40:39.103
Flying shark!

40:43.840 --> 40:46.710
I have to get out there.
I have to save those kids!

40:46.745 --> 40:49.278
We'll get you
there right away.

40:49.313 --> 40:51.648
We have a small plane that's
fueling up as we speak.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.548
We can leave immediately.

40:53.583 --> 40:57.654
Boss? There's
something you should see.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.122
What is it?

41:00.157 --> 41:01.856
Terror grips the town tonight

41:01.891 --> 41:06.062
in what seems to be a
series of deadly attacks.

41:06.063 --> 41:09.532
What the hell is this
about? We have to go.

41:09.567 --> 41:11.101
Hold on.

41:12.369 --> 41:14.438
A tourist from Quebec
reports that his wife

41:14.473 --> 41:16.840
was killed today
at a local beach.

41:16.875 --> 41:20.009
Killed by a shark.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.843
Dammit!

41:21.878 --> 41:23.711
Initially written
off as a false report

41:23.746 --> 41:26.516
this story has taken flight
due to a second shark attack.

41:26.551 --> 41:28.152
A woman reports
that her boyfriend

41:28.187 --> 41:30.151
was also killed by a shark.

41:30.186 --> 41:33.324
Two couples with a
very similar attack?

41:33.359 --> 41:36.092
More on this story
at six o'clock.

41:37.894 --> 41:39.829
Local beaches? Really, Janet?

41:39.864 --> 41:42.432
I thought you said the shark
was contained to the lake?

41:42.467 --> 41:45.201
There are some access
points that join the lake

41:45.202 --> 41:46.769
to some outside bodies of water

41:46.804 --> 41:50.273
but those points are
heavily secured by fences.

41:50.308 --> 41:51.807
Rodney?

41:51.842 --> 41:53.610
Checking now.

41:57.313 --> 42:02.085
It appears that all access
points have been breached.

42:04.588 --> 42:06.055
This is not good.

42:06.090 --> 42:07.555
Yeah, I would say not.

42:07.590 --> 42:09.191
This is a lakeside
community, Janet.

42:09.226 --> 42:12.930
Now that shark has the
run of the whole town.

42:12.965 --> 42:15.030
We really need
your help, Carly.

42:15.065 --> 42:19.403
I'll do what I can, but you
have to get me up there first.

42:22.907 --> 42:25.275
Five bottles
of beer on the boat

42:25.310 --> 42:27.644
five bottles of
beer! Take one down

42:27.679 --> 42:29.512
pass it around
Captain?

42:29.547 --> 42:31.315
Four bottles of
beer on the boat!

42:31.350 --> 42:33.234
-Captain!
-Four bottles of beer

42:33.269 --> 42:35.119
on the boat, four
bottles of beer!

42:35.154 --> 42:36.937
-Captain.
-Take one down

42:36.972 --> 42:38.721
pass it around
Captain!

42:41.925 --> 42:43.494
Three bottles of
beer on the boat!

42:43.529 --> 42:46.931
Shut
up! Just stop singing!

42:48.632 --> 42:53.637
It's my boat, it's my rules.

42:54.003 --> 42:56.972
Now where was I?

42:57.007 --> 43:00.309
You made me lose my place.

43:00.344 --> 43:02.646
I'm going to have to
start all over again.

43:02.681 --> 43:04.949
One thousand bottles
of beer on the boat

43:04.984 --> 43:06.968
one thousand bottles of beer!

43:07.003 --> 43:08.952
Take one down, pass it around!

43:31.208 --> 43:32.492
What the hell was that?

43:32.527 --> 43:34.036
I think we hit something!

43:34.071 --> 43:35.545
There's nothing here to hit.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.413
Let me take a look-see.

43:37.414 --> 43:38.747
Be careful.

43:38.782 --> 43:42.486
Don't worry your pretty
little head, missy.

43:56.300 --> 43:59.003
Kimberly!
Hold on!

43:59.038 --> 44:01.336
Kim, swim towards the boat!

44:01.371 --> 44:02.940
No, don't! Swim
towards the shore!

44:02.975 --> 44:05.041
There's something by the boat!

44:14.585 --> 44:18.288
Hello? Professor
Reynolds, is that you?

44:22.693 --> 44:24.158
Please help us!

44:24.193 --> 44:26.529
Kim is gonna make it!

44:28.431 --> 44:29.866
My god!

44:29.867 --> 44:32.285
Professor! Professor,
you have to send help!

44:32.320 --> 44:34.704
The shark just got
Kimberly! What do we do?

44:53.956 --> 44:56.826
Stay together, don't
move. Get closer!

45:00.496 --> 45:01.863
What's she saying?

45:01.898 --> 45:04.601
Something about...
don't stay together.

45:04.636 --> 45:06.336
My god, split up!

45:10.039 --> 45:12.173
No, stay together!

45:12.208 --> 45:14.811
No, stay together!
She said stay together!

45:17.547 --> 45:19.048
Dammit!

45:32.396 --> 45:35.132
Steven! Steven!

45:35.197 --> 45:38.902
Swim! Get to shore
while its busy feeding.

45:50.914 --> 45:54.718
Sit tight,
May. Help is coming.

46:02.025 --> 46:03.894
Janet, we've run out of time.

46:03.929 --> 46:05.626
We have to get there.

46:05.661 --> 46:08.397
I told you, my people are
already filling up the plane.

46:08.398 --> 46:10.532
Well, isn't
there a faster way?

46:10.567 --> 46:13.836
If you think you can run
there any faster, be my guest.

46:13.871 --> 46:16.773
Dammit, this is
history repeating itself.

46:16.808 --> 46:19.675
Just like what
happened to my sister.

46:19.710 --> 46:22.112
This is the life.

46:22.147 --> 46:24.447
I know?

46:27.784 --> 46:30.186
The water looks great?

46:36.059 --> 46:38.896
Yep, the perfect day.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.637
Such an amazing day for sure.

46:49.106 --> 46:51.573
What the-? You freak!

46:51.608 --> 46:54.611
I'm sorry,
I couldn't resist.

46:54.646 --> 46:56.410
You were so out of it.

46:56.445 --> 46:57.930
Well, I'm not out of it now.

46:57.965 --> 46:59.416
What the heck is this stuff?

46:59.451 --> 47:00.849
Sunblock.

47:00.884 --> 47:03.253
Now you won't burn that forehead
of yours like you always do

47:04.288 --> 47:05.854
You're nuts, you know that?

47:05.889 --> 47:07.555
Quit complaining
and go wash it off.

47:07.590 --> 47:10.760
Three years of
university paying off right now.

47:10.795 --> 47:13.294
-Shut up.
-Whatever.

47:13.329 --> 47:15.065
You know you could have
gotten some in my eye.

47:15.100 --> 47:17.466
You know
you coulda got some in my eye.

47:17.501 --> 47:20.470
Dammit Carly, I told you
I'd get something in my eye.

47:20.505 --> 47:21.903
Stop being such a big baby.

47:21.938 --> 47:24.440
Just dunk your head in the
water, it'll rinse right out.

47:24.475 --> 47:25.775
Pass me my towel, would you?

47:25.810 --> 47:27.975
I still can't see.

47:28.010 --> 47:31.514
Fine, I'll get
it you big baby.

47:34.083 --> 47:35.618
Alright, let's stop
horsing around.

47:35.619 --> 47:36.751
We have some work to do.

47:36.786 --> 47:38.519
Like I'm the one
horsing around.

47:38.554 --> 47:42.893
Look I know, but let's
collect the sample we need.

47:42.928 --> 47:45.059
Once we figure out if
there was any drilling

47:45.094 --> 47:47.797
that was done here then
we can call it a job done.

47:47.832 --> 47:50.266
Fine. Pass me a test tube.

48:07.251 --> 48:08.652
Ta da!

48:09.786 --> 48:11.955
Rita!

48:11.990 --> 48:14.124
What?

48:18.128 --> 48:20.562
Carly? Carly!

48:20.597 --> 48:22.897
Let's get to the landing strip.

48:22.932 --> 48:25.402
The plane will be
there when we arrive.

48:25.437 --> 48:27.570
Let's go.

48:35.711 --> 48:37.114
Sheriff, sheriff!

48:37.149 --> 48:39.080
A shark.

48:39.115 --> 48:40.849
You guessed it.

48:40.884 --> 48:42.719
This story's pretty
weird though.

48:42.754 --> 48:44.519
Weirder than shark
attacks on a lake?

48:44.554 --> 48:47.840
A man and a woman
were walking on the waterfront

48:47.875 --> 48:51.127
and the woman says the
man was eaten by a shark.

48:51.128 --> 48:52.794
So what's so weird about that?

48:52.829 --> 48:55.565
She was in the
water. He was on land!

48:55.600 --> 48:57.131
Come again?

48:57.166 --> 48:59.800
She said he was eaten
by a flying shark!

48:59.835 --> 49:02.471
Flying shark? Well now
I've heard everything.

49:02.472 --> 49:04.690
What should we do, sheriff?

49:04.725 --> 49:06.909
Should we go close the beaches?

49:06.944 --> 49:08.242
Round up a posse?

49:08.277 --> 49:10.077
One thing at a time, deputy.

49:10.112 --> 49:13.884
First things first,
help me find my pants.

49:13.919 --> 49:15.617
Yes, sir.

49:15.652 --> 49:17.785
Then we'll go
down to that island

49:17.820 --> 49:20.923
and find out what
the hell's going on!

49:20.958 --> 49:22.759
Penninsula.

49:37.007 --> 49:42.012
Kim, Steven. The phone!

49:47.384 --> 49:50.053
I have wifi here!

49:50.088 --> 49:52.687
I have wifi here?

49:52.722 --> 49:56.092
This is a really good phone.

49:58.795 --> 50:01.463
Come on. Crap.

50:01.498 --> 50:03.865
Come on May, you can do this.

50:03.900 --> 50:06.670
Keep it together.
Just keep it together.

51:14.137 --> 51:15.905
My gosh!

51:18.108 --> 51:20.544
Hello? Hello?

51:22.945 --> 51:25.114
The what?

51:25.149 --> 51:27.283
Hello there.

51:27.284 --> 51:29.419
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to frighten you.

51:29.454 --> 51:30.952
Who are you?

51:30.987 --> 51:34.423
I'm Howell and
this is my island.

51:34.458 --> 51:36.192
Your island?

51:36.193 --> 51:38.044
But there's a shark here.

51:38.079 --> 51:39.895
It killed my friends.

51:39.896 --> 51:42.332
I know, that would be mine.

51:42.367 --> 51:44.099
Yours?

51:44.134 --> 51:46.535
Yeah, but don't worry.

51:46.570 --> 51:49.239
It's genetically engineered
and slightly radioactive.

51:49.274 --> 51:51.942
It's likely going
to be dead soon.

51:51.977 --> 51:53.777
What are you even doing here?

51:53.812 --> 51:55.242
Experiments.

51:55.277 --> 51:57.046
You're experimenting
on sharks?

51:57.047 --> 52:00.617
They are beautiful creatures
but I made them better.

52:00.652 --> 52:02.517
No, they kill people.

52:02.552 --> 52:06.056
No no, they are nature's
most perfect machine.

52:06.091 --> 52:07.925
Perfect machine?

52:07.960 --> 52:09.724
You bet they are.

52:09.759 --> 52:13.730
They can smell one part per
million of blood in sea water.

52:13.765 --> 52:17.067
They can hear their prey
from many kilometers away.

52:17.102 --> 52:19.568
They can even detect the
electromagnetic field

52:19.603 --> 52:21.771
that all living
creatures create.

52:21.806 --> 52:23.671
Electromagnetic?

52:23.706 --> 52:25.606
That's right.,
the shark has got

52:25.641 --> 52:29.011
the greatest electrical
sensitivity of any animal.

52:29.012 --> 52:30.711
They can find their
hidden prey by simply

52:30.746 --> 52:33.482
detecting the electric
field that they produce.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.153
I gotta get off this island.

52:38.588 --> 52:40.356
It ain't gonna happen.

52:41.824 --> 52:43.492
Is that blood on your hands?

52:45.094 --> 52:46.495
I need your help.

52:46.496 --> 52:48.662
What do you mean?

52:48.697 --> 52:50.933
My masterpiece is ready.

52:50.934 --> 52:53.367
No, you're crazy.

52:53.402 --> 52:58.340
That's what Janet
said, I'm crazy.

52:58.375 --> 53:03.280
And in a sane world it's
the crazy man who's king.

53:04.847 --> 53:09.853
Behold, the next step in
the evolution of the shark!

53:27.704 --> 53:28.803
This is horrible.

53:28.838 --> 53:30.671
We need to call
the National Guard.

53:30.706 --> 53:34.643
But this is Canada, we
don't have a National Guard.

53:34.678 --> 53:37.144
What are we gonna do?

53:37.179 --> 53:38.914
How many
victims do you need

53:38.949 --> 53:40.682
to qualify as a crisis?

53:40.717 --> 53:43.420
I don't know, three or four?

53:43.455 --> 53:47.023
I think we're good.

53:48.657 --> 53:51.393
I have to admit Janet,
that was a pretty nice plane.

53:51.428 --> 53:54.396
I know, it cost me enough.

53:55.731 --> 53:57.233
Did you hear that?

53:57.268 --> 53:58.332
Yes.

53:58.367 --> 54:00.603
Is that a flying shark?

54:05.307 --> 54:06.692
My god!

54:06.727 --> 54:08.042
My plane!

54:08.077 --> 54:09.278
Professor Reynolds!

54:09.313 --> 54:11.245
May! May.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.815
I'm so glad to see you.

54:12.850 --> 54:14.350
-Are you ok?
-Yeah.

54:14.351 --> 54:16.084
Kim? Steven?

54:16.119 --> 54:19.289
The shark, we fell
in the water and...

54:22.157 --> 54:24.576
It's ok, I'll get
you off this island

54:24.611 --> 54:26.996
and I'll make those
responsible pay.

54:27.031 --> 54:28.498
We need to move.

54:28.533 --> 54:29.897
Who's this?

54:29.932 --> 54:33.836
May, meet Janet, the one
responsible for all of this.

54:33.871 --> 54:34.936
You bitch.

54:34.971 --> 54:37.340
No May, it's not the time.

54:37.375 --> 54:39.908
But Kim and Steven...

54:39.943 --> 54:41.209
I hate to break this up...

54:41.244 --> 54:43.313
Then don't. She
needs a moment.

54:43.348 --> 54:44.948
We may not have one.

54:49.952 --> 54:52.688
Shit, we need
to get out of here.

54:52.723 --> 54:54.290
Janet, which way?

54:54.291 --> 54:55.689
I don't know!

54:55.724 --> 54:58.460
I own the island but I've
never been here before.

54:58.527 --> 55:00.829
There was a creepy
guy back the way I came.

55:00.864 --> 55:02.565
Then let's head that way.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.064
But he did this.

55:04.099 --> 55:06.168
Yeah, so he may know how
to get us off the island.

55:06.203 --> 55:07.436
Let's go.

55:23.186 --> 55:24.854
-May!
-Over here.

55:26.121 --> 55:28.540
What happened? Where did it go?

55:28.575 --> 55:30.960
I don't know.
Come on, let's go.

55:30.995 --> 55:33.827
Janet? Janet!

55:33.862 --> 55:36.365
I think she fell
down that hill.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.633
Dammit Janet.

55:38.668 --> 55:40.334
What do we do now?

55:40.369 --> 55:41.535
We have to find that guy.

55:41.570 --> 55:42.706
He'll know how to get
us off the island.

55:42.741 --> 55:44.240
Ok, well he was back this way.

55:44.275 --> 55:45.942
Okay.

55:50.547 --> 55:55.552
Carly? May?

55:57.786 --> 56:00.155
Hell, Janet.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.490
Brad.

56:02.525 --> 56:04.576
What are you doing here?

56:04.611 --> 56:06.593
I own this island, remember?

56:06.628 --> 56:09.833
No you don't,
you sold it to me.

56:09.868 --> 56:12.233
Your check bounced.

56:12.268 --> 56:14.771
Doesn't matter. I don't
work for you anymore.

56:14.806 --> 56:16.923
Wait a minute.

56:16.958 --> 56:19.117
You did it, didn't you?

56:19.152 --> 56:21.242
You made the formula work.

56:21.277 --> 56:23.278
Well that would
seem pretty clear.

56:23.313 --> 56:25.312
Wait dammit!

56:25.347 --> 56:28.884
I want you to come
back and work for me.

56:28.885 --> 56:32.255
After what you did? No way.

56:32.290 --> 56:34.122
I can change that.

56:34.157 --> 56:38.061
Anything you want, I
can make it happen.

56:38.096 --> 56:41.930
It doesn't matter.
I don't trust you.

56:41.965 --> 56:46.236
I asked you for one
thing and one thing only

56:46.271 --> 56:48.769
and you laughed at me. Me!

56:48.804 --> 56:50.973
The most brilliant
scientist on your staff

56:50.974 --> 56:54.177
and you humiliated me
in front of everyone.

56:54.212 --> 56:56.079
Well, no more.

56:58.882 --> 57:00.616
-What?
-We have to kill it.

57:00.651 --> 57:02.351
It's happening all over again!

57:02.386 --> 57:04.287
Ok, we'll kill it.

57:04.322 --> 57:06.506
Where's my bag?

57:06.541 --> 57:08.655
Watch the skies.

57:08.690 --> 57:11.627
Why is there never a cop
around when you need one?

57:19.436 --> 57:23.389
Shouldn't we be
doing something?

57:23.424 --> 57:27.342
We are. We're
securing the beach.

57:40.590 --> 57:42.892
-The sky.
-Right.

57:48.764 --> 57:51.064
May, are you alright?

57:51.099 --> 57:54.001
Yeah. You get the
number of that truck?

57:54.036 --> 57:57.639
Well I see you didn't
damage your sense of humor.

57:57.674 --> 58:00.676
Screw it, you're
my responsibility

58:00.677 --> 58:03.010
and I'm going to get
you off this island.

58:03.045 --> 58:05.748
I won't let what happened
to my sister happen to you.

58:05.783 --> 58:07.448
Can you walk?

58:07.483 --> 58:09.651
Help me up and I'll dance.

58:09.686 --> 58:12.088
Yeah, forget what I said
about your sense of humor.

58:12.123 --> 58:14.254
I thought it was funny.

58:14.289 --> 58:17.226
Sorry ladies, but you're
not going anywhere.

58:21.764 --> 58:23.949
There's my baby.

58:23.984 --> 58:26.134
You can't do that!

58:26.135 --> 58:29.405
Yeah, I think I
can. Right, Janet?

58:31.407 --> 58:32.606
I knew it!

58:32.641 --> 58:34.877
I knew this is what
you wanted all along.

58:34.878 --> 58:37.380
I'm sorry you feel that way.

58:39.047 --> 58:41.383
Thank god, Janet.

58:41.384 --> 58:43.818
Don't thank me yet.

58:43.853 --> 58:46.722
You were right about one thing:

58:46.757 --> 58:48.923
that fish needs to die

58:48.958 --> 58:51.193
and you're just
the one to do it.

58:51.228 --> 58:53.126
No, it's too dangerous.

58:53.161 --> 58:54.930
We have to get off this island.

58:54.931 --> 58:57.166
There's no boat.

58:57.201 --> 58:59.367
Yeah there is.

58:59.402 --> 59:01.771
I have one on the other
side of the island.

59:01.806 --> 59:04.474
A really nice 30-foot
pleasure craft.

59:04.509 --> 59:09.479
Radio, GPS, even a jacuzzi.

59:09.646 --> 59:13.182
All the bells and whistles.

59:13.217 --> 59:15.751
What?

59:17.619 --> 59:20.856
Alright, let's go before
the shark comes back

59:20.891 --> 59:22.992
while we still have a chance.

59:23.027 --> 59:25.359
No. We're killing it.

59:25.394 --> 59:29.532
You're killing it, so grab
your gear and go hunting.

59:31.534 --> 59:34.053
Ok, don't hurt anyone.

59:34.088 --> 59:36.497
You better not miss.

59:36.532 --> 59:38.872
No, you can't do this.

59:38.907 --> 59:40.909
It's a monster,
it has to be killed.

59:40.944 --> 59:42.609
No!

59:42.644 --> 59:44.746
She's right, the
fish has to die.

59:44.781 --> 59:47.783
No, not my baby!

59:47.784 --> 59:51.387
Hey, give it back!

59:58.193 --> 01:00:00.528
Janet.

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:04.166
Brad. Why did I marry you?

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:07.170
Because I said yes.

01:00:11.039 --> 01:00:13.207
May, how did you know?

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.677
Well, I saw him
fiddling with this

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:15.876
when we heard the shark come

01:00:15.911 --> 01:00:17.312
and then I remembered
what he said

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:20.182
about shark's having an
electromagnetic sensitivity.

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:21.784
So I just figured,
maybe he was using this

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.519
to hide his
electromagnetic field.

01:00:23.554 --> 01:00:25.854
May, that was brilliant!

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:29.224
I don't care what they say
about you, that was brilliant.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:32.626
Thanks, I just... wait, what?

01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:33.962
Let's go before
the shark comes back.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.065
What do they say about me?

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.503
Professor, we can use
this to hide from the shark

01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:43.639
while we look for Howell's boat.

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:47.676
We're not going, are we.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:51.180
I hate to admit it
but Janet was right.

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:53.146
We need to kill this thing.

01:00:53.181 --> 01:00:57.786
-But...
-No buts. Stay hidden.

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:02.624
Come on out, you flying fish!

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:06.262
You've had your dinner
now have your dessert.

01:01:17.773 --> 01:01:19.509
Professor Reynolds?

01:01:20.742 --> 01:01:22.511
May, no!

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.798
-It's coming.
-May, what have you done?

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:29.117
It won't come unless
it smells blood.

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:44.867
Professor?

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.805
It's been a blast.

01:01:50.806 --> 01:01:53.709
Chief, I mean sheriff, look!

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.914
Well look at that.

01:02:00.949 --> 01:02:02.384
Do you think that's
the flying shark

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.087
everyone's been talking about?

01:02:05.887 --> 01:02:08.356
I reckon so.

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:25.942
Cool!

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.064
You did it!

01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:33.758
We did it.

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:35.417
Now what?

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.618
We find Howell's boat
and we go home.

01:02:38.653 --> 01:02:41.123
You know, you did really
good figuring out

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:42.991
that electromagnetic thing.

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:45.260
Thanks, you weren't so bad
with that action hero bit.

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:49.398
Thanks. Did you finish
your homework for Monday?

01:02:53.953 --> 01:02:57.453
Subrip: Pix

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:53.079
# Baby tryin to hurt
me when I'm down

01:05:53.114 --> 01:05:56.651
# And baby you know my
heart's been kicked around

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:58.653
# Well too much of you

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:00.488
# Is what's been getting to me

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:04.427
# And I don't want
to hear you're sorry

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:06.129
# Well I can't stand it

01:06:06.164 --> 01:06:07.796
# Frustration makes me blue

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:11.550
# But I'm so glad
I'm gettin rid of you

01:06:11.585 --> 01:06:15.269
# I've taken all I
can take from you

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:19.073
# Baby you lied and
you took me for a ride

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:22.861
# Well I can't tell ya
how much that hurt inside

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:26.614
# Well if I can't take it
there's one thing I can do

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:30.552
