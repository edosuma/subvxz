01:28.054 --> 01:29.287
Shuffle.

01:31.123 --> 01:32.257
All right?
                  Yeah.

01:32.324 --> 01:34.225
We'll shuffle it again,
all right?

01:34.293 --> 01:36.961
Can I show you guys
         a card trick?

01:37.029 --> 01:38.863
Yeah, sure.

01:38.931 --> 01:39.864
Go ahead.

01:39.932 --> 01:42.867
Uh, could I have
      a little room here?

01:42.902 --> 01:44.535
Okay, it's
     all right.

01:45.872 --> 01:48.240
JIM:
Okay, now.

01:48.274 --> 01:52.276
Latka, pick a card,

01:52.344 --> 01:54.645
show it to Tony and Alex.

01:54.713 --> 01:56.615
Okay.
                 And put it back
                    in the deck.

02:01.387 --> 02:03.421
I got it.
                 All right.

02:03.489 --> 02:05.257
Okay, here you go.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.892
All right.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.929
Now here comes the good part.

02:10.996 --> 02:13.932
I'm gonna magically
       make Latka's card

02:13.999 --> 02:15.800
rise to the top of the deck.

02:24.710 --> 02:26.510
(grunts)

02:26.579 --> 02:28.312
What was your card?

02:28.414 --> 02:29.947
The queen of spades.

02:32.818 --> 02:35.754
Voila!

02:35.888 --> 02:40.458
Not only has your card
 risen to the top of the deck,

02:40.526 --> 02:44.128
but it has changed
   into the ace of diamonds.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.997
Oh, Jim.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.565
No, no, he's right.
                   He was lucky.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.934
Let me see you
                  do that again.
No, no, no.

02:50.002 --> 02:52.903
Always leave them wanting more.

02:52.972 --> 02:54.272
Thank you very much.

02:56.208 --> 02:57.742
Guys, I need some advice.

02:57.809 --> 02:58.843
Yeah?

02:58.910 --> 03:00.478
I have a very important
       decision to make,

03:00.546 --> 03:02.514
and it's driving me crazy.

03:02.582 --> 03:05.583
I was just offered a job
           as manager

03:05.651 --> 03:08.219
of this terrific new art gallery
          in Seattle.

03:08.287 --> 03:09.887
It-it's small now,
     but it has potential,

03:09.955 --> 03:11.388
and I can grow with it.
   Oh.

03:11.456 --> 03:13.157
Seattle is
             a great town.

03:13.225 --> 03:14.692
I got friends there.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.560
Well, that's one strike
          against it.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.964
But the other drawback-- here
 I'd have to uproot my family,

03:20.032 --> 03:21.799
you know, and leave
 my-my friends and everything,

03:21.867 --> 03:23.668
Yeah.
   and-and reestablish myself

03:23.736 --> 03:26.437
in a strange community
       3,000 miles away.

03:26.505 --> 03:28.405
So, what do you
       think I should do?

03:28.474 --> 03:30.574
I don't know.

03:30.643 --> 03:31.809
I don't know either.

03:31.877 --> 03:34.145
You know, but I had to make
   a decision like this once.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.380
It was the crossroads
          of my life.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.615
Maybe if I told you about it,
       it would help you.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.616
Oh, yeah.

03:38.683 --> 03:41.352
Good, 'cause I'd love
          to tell it.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.354
(crowd cheering)

03:48.327 --> 03:50.128
You remember our strategy
for the fight, don't you, kid?

03:50.196 --> 03:52.196
Yeah, Jack, uh, don't
             lead with my right,

03:52.264 --> 03:53.464
uh, keep moving,

03:53.532 --> 03:57.035
uh, work the body
and watch out for the left hook,

03:57.102 --> 03:58.369
and, above all, flatter the bum.

03:58.437 --> 04:00.738
What?

04:02.842 --> 04:04.876
Flatten the bum.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.110
Flatten him.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.111
Oh, that makes
                     more sense.

04:07.179 --> 04:08.546
Makes more sense?

04:08.614 --> 04:10.748
Why would go out and flatter
 someone you were gonna fight?

04:10.783 --> 04:12.017
Psychological ploy?

04:12.084 --> 04:14.218
Oh, I guess if he's wearing
      a particularly nice

04:14.286 --> 04:16.588
pair of shorts, it couldn't hurt
         to mention it.

04:20.759 --> 04:21.760
Hello, Jack.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.060
Frank.

04:23.162 --> 04:25.329
Like to talk to
                  your boy here.

04:25.364 --> 04:27.699
Uh, no, Frank,
he's a good kid.

04:27.766 --> 04:29.567
He's a good kid.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.005
(door closes)

04:34.073 --> 04:34.939
Heard a lot
                      about you.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.006
Heard you have
                   real promise.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.075
Yeah.

04:37.142 --> 04:38.509
Gonna win a
                  lot of fights.
Yeah.

04:38.577 --> 04:41.011
But you're not
              gonna win tonight.

04:41.046 --> 04:43.381
Wilkes is gonna drop you
      in the third round.

04:43.415 --> 04:45.416
Gee, no wonder Jack didn't
    want you to talk to me.

04:45.484 --> 04:46.618
You're so discouraging.

04:46.785 --> 04:49.754
I represent
                     some people

04:49.821 --> 04:51.556
who've bet a lot of
              money against you.

04:51.590 --> 04:52.723
Oh, no.

04:52.791 --> 04:53.757
Are they right very often?

04:53.825 --> 04:54.959
Oh, wait,
don't tell me, man.

04:55.026 --> 04:56.361
This could
shake my confidence.

04:56.428 --> 05:00.565
Think I better try a
             different approach.

05:03.602 --> 05:05.836
I want you to
                    take a dive.

05:05.904 --> 05:07.372
In the third round.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.241
In the ring.

05:10.309 --> 05:12.310
Tonight.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.946
You want me
to throw the fight?

05:15.013 --> 05:17.081
That's what
                     I'm asking.

05:17.149 --> 05:18.316
I thought so.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.651
Well, you can forget it.

05:19.785 --> 05:22.787
You cooperate,
we'll make things easy for you.

05:22.855 --> 05:26.357
Money, training,
     uh, good fight dates.

05:26.425 --> 05:28.426
You know, a chance to move up.

05:28.527 --> 05:29.694
Losing this
                  fight could be

05:29.762 --> 05:31.729
the best thing you ever
            did for your career.

05:31.797 --> 05:35.633
But you cross me,
     you're gonna be sorry.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.135
Hey, you know,
     you're the kind of guy

05:37.202 --> 05:38.336
that gives Italians a bad name.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.171
I'm not Italian.

05:40.239 --> 05:43.374
Well, do they know
       you're doing this?

05:43.442 --> 05:45.276
Think it over, kid.

05:45.343 --> 05:47.312
Don't be a sap.

05:53.819 --> 05:56.454
I'm sorry, Tony,
but these kind of things happen.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.556
It's okay. Just tell me
what round you're going down in,

05:58.624 --> 06:00.558
so I can help you
       make it look good.

06:00.593 --> 06:01.358
Ah, forget it.

06:01.494 --> 06:02.727
You ain't gonna have to do that,

06:02.795 --> 06:04.328
'cause I ain't laying down
         for that guy.

06:04.363 --> 06:05.262
Tony, think about it.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.664
Frank must have made
       some good offers.

06:06.732 --> 06:08.499
Money, fights, a better manager.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.100
Better manager? What do I need
     a better manager for?

06:10.168 --> 06:11.869
I got you, Jack. When it comes
     to training fighters,

06:11.937 --> 06:13.070
you wrote the book, bud.

06:13.172 --> 06:14.405
I know you think so,

06:14.473 --> 06:16.107
but I'm not that great.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.542
I mean, jumping rope
          for timing,

06:18.610 --> 06:21.412
I didn't really think that up.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.681
How about, how about
      running for stamina?

06:23.782 --> 06:26.150
I hate to burst
       your bubble, kid,

06:26.218 --> 06:28.886
but, uh, that's older than
         jumping rope.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.521
How about improving
    the speed of my punches

06:30.589 --> 06:31.689
by shaving my forearms?

06:31.723 --> 06:33.958
You mean,
   my wind resistance theory?

06:34.059 --> 06:35.025
See?

06:35.093 --> 06:36.661
The point is
    you're a great manager.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.762
And we're gonna go out there
 together, and we're gonna win.

06:38.864 --> 06:40.064
I'm proud of
                      you, Tony.

06:40.131 --> 06:42.032
You got a lot of guts
      standing up to those guys.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.202
I'm gonna be with you
         all the way, in spirit.

06:45.237 --> 06:46.771
What do you mean "in spirit"?
       I mean, ain't you

06:46.838 --> 06:48.305
gonna be in my corner?
        Don't you care?

06:48.374 --> 06:49.640
Of course, I care.

06:49.708 --> 06:52.677
And I want to hear
 all about it after the fight.

06:52.744 --> 06:55.279
You call me at my sister's
            place in Union City.

06:57.349 --> 06:59.783
Use a pay phone.

06:59.851 --> 07:00.984
I'll call you.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.187
See ya.

07:05.824 --> 07:08.125
(door closes)

07:08.193 --> 07:09.994
Yeah, well,
     I'm glad you're gone.

07:10.061 --> 07:11.462
I don't need your help anyway.

07:11.564 --> 07:12.864
I don't need nobody's help.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.766
I'll win this fight alone
      with nobody's help.

07:18.404 --> 07:20.238
Excuse me, somebody, please!

07:20.306 --> 07:24.041
Banta, Wilkes,
 no head butting, no low blows.

07:24.109 --> 07:26.811
In the event of a knockdown,
    go to a neutral corner.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.212
Shake hands.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.313
And good luck.

07:29.414 --> 07:30.815
Hey, I feel sorry for you, man.

07:30.882 --> 07:32.984
You're fighting an angry man
         with a cause.

07:34.753 --> 07:36.153
And I hope you bet
a lot of money

07:36.221 --> 07:38.088
on your boy, 'cause you're gonna
lose it tonight, see?

07:38.224 --> 07:39.490
I'm gonna pulverize him.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.259
(bell rings)

08:02.113 --> 08:03.347
You're going down hard
tonight, man.

08:03.415 --> 08:05.182
Tony Banta don't take
no dives for nobody.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.518
I know, man. That's why they
        got me to take the dive.

08:07.586 --> 08:08.352
You're taking the dive?

08:08.420 --> 08:09.353
That's right!

08:09.421 --> 08:10.788
You're a disgrace!

08:10.855 --> 08:13.591
I know, man, but tag me a good
     one so I can go down, okay?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.927
Break it up!

08:15.994 --> 08:17.628
No, man, I don't want
no part of this.

08:17.696 --> 08:19.363
Come on, man,
       I need the dough!
No, no.

08:19.465 --> 08:20.765
(grunts)

08:22.034 --> 08:24.101
Go to a neutral
                         corner.

08:27.272 --> 08:29.073
Six, seven...

08:29.174 --> 08:30.708
How do you live with yourself?

08:30.809 --> 08:32.443
...eight, nine, ten!

08:32.544 --> 08:34.212
You're out!
        (crowd cheering)

08:34.279 --> 08:37.015
Oh, Tony, that was a tough
   decision you had to make.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.917
I respect your choice.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.818
It makes me want to hear
  what you think I should do.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.520
Well, I'm flattered.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.155
I think you should ask Alex.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.290
No, Tony.

08:46.358 --> 08:47.758
Now, look, I don't want
      that responsibility.

08:47.826 --> 08:48.859
Ahh...
           Thank you.

08:48.894 --> 08:51.261
Tony, I want to hear
        what you think.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.697
Okay, here goes.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.098
Think you should wait.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.033
Think you should hang in there,
stay cool, and sooner or later,

08:56.101 --> 08:57.302
even though he says
       he's not going to,

08:57.369 --> 08:58.636
Alex is gonna tell you
          what to do.

08:58.737 --> 09:00.871
Hey, come on, Tony.

09:00.973 --> 09:04.474
Nardo, you're wasting
                your time

09:04.542 --> 09:07.611
listening to
        Profiles in Sewage here.

09:07.679 --> 09:09.346
You want some
                      real help?

09:09.414 --> 09:11.950
You listen to a
           success story-- mine.

09:12.017 --> 09:13.751
I don't want
to hear this story.

09:13.852 --> 09:15.153
Oh, I do, I do.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.722
I have been looking for
   something to fill the void

09:17.790 --> 09:19.090
ever since my last canker sore.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.793
(laughs)

09:21.860 --> 09:23.427
(groans)

09:23.495 --> 09:24.429
Come on, Louie, tell.

09:26.532 --> 09:30.200
I was at the lowest point
          in my life--

09:30.268 --> 09:32.937
toiling at a menial,

09:33.005 --> 09:37.708
dead-end job,
     far beneath my dignity

09:37.776 --> 09:39.376
as a human being.

09:39.378 --> 09:40.744
Hey, what were you doing, Louie?

09:40.846 --> 09:43.748
I was a cabdriver.

09:49.854 --> 09:51.021
What?!

09:51.056 --> 09:54.792
Only $25 for an entire shift?

09:54.860 --> 09:56.293
Oh, this is just terrible.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.628
It's terrible.

09:57.696 --> 09:59.029
I know how you feel, son.

09:59.097 --> 10:01.098
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you a little something

10:01.166 --> 10:02.900
that'll pick your spirits up
           a wee bit.

10:02.968 --> 10:04.802
A little slice of heaven.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.204
A piece of my wife's
peach pie.

10:07.272 --> 10:09.406
You know, I was saving it
for myself for lunch,

10:09.474 --> 10:11.943
but I'm thinking that
you'll need it more than I do.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.077
(chuckles)

10:13.145 --> 10:15.179
(blowing nose)

10:15.246 --> 10:18.415
Oh, you still haven't
cured that cold yet,

10:18.484 --> 10:19.784
have you, Phillipe?

10:19.851 --> 10:23.087
Well, let me set aside
        cab 512 for you.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.456
It's got the best heater
         in the fleet.

10:25.490 --> 10:27.090
Thanks a lot.

10:41.373 --> 10:43.875
Top o' the morning
                  to you, Louie.

10:43.942 --> 10:45.877
Cram it up your bagpipe.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.514
Well, it
                      so happens

10:50.582 --> 10:52.116
I've got a little something here

10:52.184 --> 10:54.651
that'll make you feel
         a tad happier.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.786
Forget it.

10:55.854 --> 10:57.989
Your wife's peach slop
      gives me the trots.

11:08.066 --> 11:10.635
Anybody for a game
          of strip poker?

11:10.669 --> 11:14.405
A pair or better
                 to open, Lydia.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.408
Whoo!

11:21.379 --> 11:23.013
Uh, Louie?

11:23.081 --> 11:24.014
Yeah?

11:24.082 --> 11:25.449
Could I have a
                  word with you?

11:25.517 --> 11:26.917
Ah, sure.

11:26.985 --> 11:29.152
See, I-I've got to take my
         sister to the doctor's.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.721
Nothing serious,
                       mind you.

11:30.789 --> 11:33.824
Oh, you don't know
       how relieved I am.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.293
Well, you see,
      you're the only man

11:35.360 --> 11:37.995
who knows this job
   as well as I do, so if you

11:38.062 --> 11:40.430
could take charge of the office
     for a couple of hours,

11:40.498 --> 11:42.733
I'd be everlastingly grateful
   to you for the wee favor.

11:42.801 --> 11:44.601
(laughing):
        Are you kidding?

11:44.737 --> 11:48.005
You want me to give up
  two hours of tips and fares

11:48.073 --> 11:50.608
to sit in the cage
 while you're off goldbricking

11:50.675 --> 11:52.710
at a doctor's office? Ha!

11:52.744 --> 11:55.512
I'm sorry it has to come
       to this, but, uh,

11:55.580 --> 11:59.550
if you force me
  to order you, Louie, I will.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.251
Go on, go on.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.655
Aw, come on.

12:07.058 --> 12:09.860
(speaking indistinctly)
             Eh...

12:10.963 --> 12:13.130
All right, all right.

12:13.198 --> 12:14.331
All right, but don't think

12:14.399 --> 12:16.968
you're gonna make
              a habit of this.
All right.

12:17.035 --> 12:19.604
How about letting them know
           who's in charge here?

12:19.671 --> 12:21.772
Uh, attention, everybody!

12:21.840 --> 12:24.742
Hey, wh-what's the
               matter with this,
                it doesn't work?

12:24.810 --> 12:27.712
Now, why would a person
want to blast their voice

12:27.779 --> 12:31.181
over a loudspeaker when they
could talk to them very...

12:31.249 --> 12:33.384
Now, hear this!

12:33.451 --> 12:35.319
For the next two hours,

12:35.387 --> 12:38.622
Louie De Palma,
   totally against his will,

12:38.690 --> 12:41.792
is gonna be squandering
      his precious talent

12:41.860 --> 12:46.397
sitting in a cage doing a job
     a chimpanzee could do.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.835
Louie, I'll be
back shortly.

12:52.237 --> 12:55.606
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I'll be making it up to you.

12:55.674 --> 12:58.142
I promise. In fact,
 you know, I'll tell you what.

12:58.209 --> 13:00.411
I'll get me missus
     to bake a Brown Betty

13:00.479 --> 13:02.747
for the company picnic--
          how's that?

13:02.814 --> 13:05.583
Yeah, who's gonna
               bring the Bromo?

13:09.188 --> 13:10.520
All right, all right,

13:10.589 --> 13:13.657
let's get some butts
       on the road here.

13:13.725 --> 13:15.693
Um...

13:15.760 --> 13:19.096
Rodriguez, cab 222.

13:19.163 --> 13:20.464
Louie,

13:20.466 --> 13:21.966
Tom said I could have cab 512.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.701
'Cause I got a cold,
 and it's got the best heater.

13:24.736 --> 13:27.537
Did he say he'd wipe
your nose for you, too?

13:27.606 --> 13:31.675
Beat it! This job stinks enough
without being a baby-sitter.

13:31.743 --> 13:32.943
Louie.

13:33.011 --> 13:34.344
What?

13:34.412 --> 13:36.847
Five bucks for a
              cab with a heater?

13:41.452 --> 13:44.088
(choral music playing)

13:55.400 --> 13:56.600
Yeah, I was
around then.

13:56.668 --> 13:58.302
It took Louie one week

13:58.369 --> 14:00.604
to undermine
poor old Tom's authority,

14:00.672 --> 14:01.839
shake his confidence

14:01.907 --> 14:04.175
and drive him right
into retirement.

14:04.209 --> 14:06.577
Thanks for spoiling
      the ending, Reiger!

14:07.979 --> 14:09.446
Aw, what the hell,
     I'll tell you anyway.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.714
Oh.

14:10.782 --> 14:12.216
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:12.317 --> 14:15.219
I wasn't the end of the world
      for that old geezer.

14:15.286 --> 14:18.055
He became a crosswalk guard.

14:18.089 --> 14:21.058
So, uh, what was
Louie's crossroad,

14:21.125 --> 14:23.861
when he decided to crawl
out from under the rock?

14:23.929 --> 14:25.329
No, it was, uh...

14:25.397 --> 14:27.664
In fact, no, that's
                    what it was.

14:27.699 --> 14:29.966
Oh, come on, you guys,
      help me decide this.

14:30.035 --> 14:30.967
Yeah, yeah.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.103
Let's see, let's see.

14:33.171 --> 14:34.871
Uh...

14:34.939 --> 14:39.176
e-excuse me, fellas.

14:39.244 --> 14:42.312
I have a story
     to tell Elaine.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.516
Hey, Jim, does it have
        anything to do with what
            we're talking about?

14:45.550 --> 14:48.119
One can only hope.

14:48.186 --> 14:49.653
(clears throat)

14:49.721 --> 14:51.389
It was...

14:51.456 --> 14:55.492
long ago, a simpler time.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.371
These brownies are great.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.373
I'm really stoned.

15:11.576 --> 15:14.244
(sitar music playing)

15:24.155 --> 15:26.557
Oh, wow. (chuckles)

15:26.625 --> 15:28.091
Far out.

15:28.159 --> 15:31.328
Everything is just so beautiful!

15:31.396 --> 15:35.232
I'm just embarrassed that you're
 seeing me crying like a baby.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.034
Gordon...

15:37.102 --> 15:39.570
Gordon, you're not crying.

15:39.671 --> 15:42.439
W-Well, what <i>am</i> I doing?

15:42.541 --> 15:43.774
You're smiling and happy.

15:43.875 --> 15:46.043
(chuckles):
         Great! Great.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.245
I'm smiling.

15:48.313 --> 15:50.514
I'm happy.

16:00.291 --> 16:03.160
Jim, watch this.

16:03.227 --> 16:04.862
It is psychedelic.

16:04.930 --> 16:07.364
Heather, I have
               seen a lava lamp.

16:07.432 --> 16:10.701
They're very colorful
                 and amusing for
             about five seconds.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.838
Now, let's go to the library
           and do some studying.

16:13.905 --> 16:16.239
Jimmy, sometimes
you are such a drag.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.409
Hey, I like to party
    as much as the next guy.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.613
(laughs): Yeah, if the next guy
          is a Quaker.

16:24.715 --> 16:29.153
Congratulations, Gordon, that
was almost a complete sentence.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.890
Really?

16:34.892 --> 16:36.493
Well, if you
                 will excuse me,

16:36.561 --> 16:38.862
I have some studying
           to do in the library.

16:38.930 --> 16:41.131
Aw, Jim, Jim...

16:41.232 --> 16:43.300
don't you understand?

16:43.368 --> 16:46.070
Huh? I mean, all the studying,

16:46.138 --> 16:49.706
all the books
     and all the libraries

16:49.774 --> 16:52.008
and all the gymnasiums...

16:54.312 --> 16:56.746
I forgot my thought!

16:59.518 --> 17:02.653
Jim, just sit down
                     for a while

17:02.720 --> 17:04.788
and have a
                brownie with us.

17:04.856 --> 17:06.123
Oh, no.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.259
Are those funny brownies?

17:08.326 --> 17:09.993
Funny brownies?

17:10.060 --> 17:12.896
Don't get cute, Heather.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.432
You love it when I'm cute.
          Oh, don't...

17:14.499 --> 17:16.867
All right, come on,
      stop it, stop it, stop it.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.502
Come on.

17:18.569 --> 17:21.570
(laughing):
             Come on, I love it,
           I love it, okay, I...

17:24.443 --> 17:27.645
Now, come on, Heather,
         what's in the brownies?

17:27.712 --> 17:30.948
Sugar, eggs, chocolate,
marijuana, flour and walnuts.

17:31.015 --> 17:34.384
You've been feeding us walnuts?!

17:34.452 --> 17:36.019
I-I will study here,

17:36.087 --> 17:38.088
but I can't have
                any distractions

17:38.155 --> 17:41.057
because I'm doing
                my term paper on
               <i>Plutarch's Lives.</i>

17:41.125 --> 17:42.359
So...

17:42.426 --> 17:44.461
the music and the brownies
          have to go,

17:44.529 --> 17:48.398
and I'm pulling the plug
      on the groovy lamp.

17:48.466 --> 17:50.500
(screams)

17:52.670 --> 17:55.906
Oh, so what are <i>we</i>
      supposed to do now?

17:57.441 --> 18:00.578
I have a suggestion:
        we could study.

18:00.645 --> 18:02.612
Let's split.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.917
Well, I'm taking
                  my lamp.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.354
Later.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.343
Heather, I think
     we better have a talk.

18:33.778 --> 18:36.280
I'll catch up
      with you guys later.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.516
Yo!
         GORDON (muffled grunt):
                Okay, Heather...

18:47.759 --> 18:50.627
You've changed.

18:50.695 --> 18:52.630
Jimmy, I'm just
      doing my own thing.

18:52.697 --> 18:54.131
You should try it.

18:54.199 --> 18:55.566
When are you
gonna realize

18:55.634 --> 18:57.768
that it's not just
doing your own thing,

18:57.835 --> 18:59.803
it's doing
the <i>right</i> thing?!

18:59.871 --> 19:02.640
We're not here to party
or to protest,

19:02.707 --> 19:04.708
but to learn.

19:04.776 --> 19:07.511
Who is gonna be
    the leaders of tomorrow?

19:22.827 --> 19:24.895
How did you guys beat me here?

19:28.466 --> 19:31.602
Gordon, this is our room.

19:31.669 --> 19:34.505
I thought the ceiling
        looked familiar.

19:36.641 --> 19:38.909
(sitar music continues)

19:38.976 --> 19:41.011
Really good band.

19:43.414 --> 19:46.584
And you think Mr. Fog over there
     is more fun than I am?

19:46.651 --> 19:49.920
Jimmy, I like it that you're
     a serious, motivated person

19:49.988 --> 19:52.590
who wants so much to
          realize his potential,

19:52.657 --> 19:54.992
but you've got
               to have some fun.

19:55.059 --> 19:56.159
I know that!

19:56.227 --> 19:58.829
Don't you think I want
    to be a rounded person?

19:58.897 --> 20:00.731
But I do have fun, though.

20:00.798 --> 20:02.966
The glee club is great fun.

20:06.304 --> 20:09.773
I don't need drugs to have fun!

20:09.841 --> 20:11.408
I get high on life.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.377
I <i>very</i> high on life.

20:13.444 --> 20:16.446
As a matter of fact,
             I'm high right now!

20:18.283 --> 20:20.850
Jimmy, everybody's
doing marijuana.

20:20.918 --> 20:24.288
It's something I enjoy,
and I want to share it
with my boyfriend.

20:24.355 --> 20:25.755
Is that so terrible?

20:25.823 --> 20:28.492
The best available
              research indicates

20:28.560 --> 20:30.794
that for some people
              it's habit-forming

20:30.862 --> 20:32.963
and leads to harder drugs.

20:33.030 --> 20:36.800
And, who knows, I could
         be one of those people.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.270
You can't reject it
until you try it.

20:40.338 --> 20:42.706
Come on, please?
                 (sighs):
               Oh, Heather,

20:42.773 --> 20:45.876
first you nag me
            into premarital sex.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.181
Okay, I'll give you that.

20:53.151 --> 20:54.485
Come on.

20:57.588 --> 20:59.923
For our relationship, okay?

21:01.692 --> 21:03.894
Okay.

21:03.961 --> 21:05.962
If I try it once,

21:06.030 --> 21:09.300
will you promise
  never to bring it up again?

21:09.367 --> 21:10.567
Yes.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.105
Okay.

21:50.174 --> 21:51.808
I've done it.

21:51.876 --> 21:52.876
It's over with.

21:52.943 --> 21:54.778
I don't want to hear
                 about it again.

21:54.845 --> 21:57.113
And let's just hope
         it's not habit-forming.

21:58.049 --> 21:59.783
Jimmy?
