WEBVTT

00:03.341 --> 00:05.175
Quick, quick, quick, here he comes.

00:06.678 --> 00:07.878
Shh.

00:09.681 --> 00:12.149
Surprise!

00:12.183 --> 00:14.117
- Happy birthday!
- Hey, guys.

00:14.152 --> 00:16.954
- Happy birthday, dad.
- Aw, you scared me. Thank you, guys.

00:16.988 --> 00:18.872
Oh, what do we have here?

00:18.906 --> 00:20.724
A birthday frittata.

00:20.758 --> 00:22.409
A frittata?

00:22.443 --> 00:24.277
Remember, you told us that story
about the delicious frittatas

00:24.312 --> 00:26.863
you had at that cafe
on the Amalfi coast?

00:26.881 --> 00:29.733
You probably forgot that I got
food poisoning on that frittata.

00:31.285 --> 00:32.536
That's why I can speak Italian.

00:32.570 --> 00:35.322
<i>"Questi pantaloni sono sporchi."</i>

00:36.624 --> 00:39.042
"These pants need cleaning."

00:39.077 --> 00:41.478
Make a wish and blow it out.

00:41.512 --> 00:44.648
Okay. What do you say
we wish for a train set?

00:44.682 --> 00:48.518
Yeah. Ready? Ready?

00:48.552 --> 00:49.936
Yay!

00:49.988 --> 00:51.638
- Okay. Present time. Me first.
- Okay.

00:51.673 --> 00:52.656
It's for you, daddy.

00:52.690 --> 00:54.207
Uh, Mandy got me a coupon book...

00:54.242 --> 00:55.208
Yeah.

00:55.243 --> 00:56.827
With, uh...
"Free hugs"...

00:56.861 --> 00:57.828
Mm-hmm.

00:57.862 --> 00:58.895
"Smile for no reason"...

00:58.930 --> 00:59.896
Mm-hmm.

00:59.914 --> 01:02.232
And "a week of no talking back."

01:03.901 --> 01:05.001
There are some blackout dates
on that one,

01:05.036 --> 01:07.871
so you just have to
check the back. I love you!

01:07.889 --> 01:10.190
Okay, I'll take the free hug.

01:12.260 --> 01:14.244
It's my turn.
This is from me and Boyd.

01:14.278 --> 01:17.014
- Ah.
- Uh, it was wrapped, but I left him alone for eight

01:17.048 --> 01:20.450
seconds and, disturbingly,
cannot find the ribbon.

01:20.485 --> 01:24.354
Ahh.

01:24.389 --> 01:25.789
We'll find it later, right?

01:25.823 --> 01:28.025
Yeah, sure will.
Okay, this is for you.

01:28.059 --> 01:30.660
Look at this.
"Bacon of the month club."

01:30.695 --> 01:32.262
Yes.

01:32.296 --> 01:34.898
17 years running.

01:34.932 --> 01:39.269
Yeah, if you make it to 20,
you get a free angiogram.

01:39.303 --> 01:41.338
What about 25?

01:41.372 --> 01:44.191
Nobody makes it to 25.

01:46.110 --> 01:50.047
Captioned by
closed captioning services, inc.

01:51.282 --> 01:52.582
Okay, honey.

01:52.617 --> 01:55.869
I know last year's gift
was a swing and a miss.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.288
Yeah, improv classes.

02:00.174 --> 02:03.794
I was hoping
you'd find your inner clown.

02:03.828 --> 02:08.931
Well, I found him,
and he was very, very sad.

02:10.300 --> 02:14.738
A history of our neighborhood?
Wow. Wow.

02:15.973 --> 02:17.941
This is actually a great gift.

02:17.975 --> 02:21.394
I'm gonna ignore that
you said the word "actually."

02:21.446 --> 02:23.280
Where'd you get something like this?

02:23.314 --> 02:24.948
Well, I know how fascinated you are

02:24.982 --> 02:27.851
with things that I am not
fascinated by at all,

02:27.885 --> 02:29.753
so I found this company

02:29.787 --> 02:32.289
that does customized histories
of neighborhoods.

02:32.323 --> 02:34.357
Did you read it?
No. "Did I read it?"

02:35.376 --> 02:36.710
History's your thing.

02:36.744 --> 02:38.027
Hearing you talk about it
while I'm doing something else--

02:38.045 --> 02:40.130
that's--that's my thing.

02:40.197 --> 02:43.199
This road out here
used to be a logging road.

02:43.217 --> 02:45.752
Just like <i>that.</i>

02:47.004 --> 02:49.172
Well, I got to get to school.

02:49.207 --> 02:52.208
New math teacher's busting my hump.

02:52.226 --> 02:54.594
Where's Boyd?

02:54.645 --> 02:58.348
Oh. He's on his little potty,
making ribbon.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.787
Guys, listen to this.

03:03.821 --> 03:06.356
In 1963, the woman that lived here...

03:06.390 --> 03:09.059
Passed away upstairs in this house.

03:09.093 --> 03:11.862
Wait. What?
Upstairs in our house?

03:11.896 --> 03:14.931
I sleep up there almost every
night. I mean, every night.

03:17.435 --> 03:20.620
- I think it's cool that our house
  has an actual story behind it.
- Uh-huh.

03:20.671 --> 03:22.572
Yeah, but it's a story about death.

03:22.607 --> 03:23.707
Death...

03:23.741 --> 03:26.910
Or murder?

03:26.928 --> 03:29.579
Eve, honey, don't scare your sisters.

03:29.614 --> 03:30.747
Why not?

03:30.781 --> 03:32.516
She's got a point.

03:32.550 --> 03:34.935
No, but, you guys, you have to
admit that it is freaky

03:34.969 --> 03:36.970
that somebody actually
died in our house.

03:37.021 --> 03:39.322
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
<i>Somebodies.</i>

03:39.357 --> 03:41.591
Looks like the woman who lived
here <i>after</i> the first woman

03:41.626 --> 03:43.393
also died in this house.

03:43.427 --> 03:46.596
So it's a trend?

03:46.631 --> 03:48.615
Oh, my God. I feel like
I'm in a horror movie,

03:48.649 --> 03:50.367
and we're gonna start
getting picked off one by one,

03:50.401 --> 03:53.036
and, mom,
the pretty girl never makes it!

03:55.740 --> 03:58.775
What room did the second lady die in?

03:58.809 --> 04:00.477
Well, I'm guessing
it's your father's den.

04:00.511 --> 04:04.414
That would explain some
of the mysterious... smells.

04:07.585 --> 04:10.520
What if Boyd has the soul
of one of the dead ladies?

04:10.555 --> 04:12.789
Why would you say that?
Eve, go to school!

04:12.823 --> 04:15.792
What was that?

04:15.810 --> 04:17.027
What was what?

04:19.163 --> 04:22.232
Ah, good times.

04:24.268 --> 04:26.336
Girls, first of all, we don't
know if any of this is true.

04:26.370 --> 04:28.939
That book cost
a lot less than you think.

04:33.261 --> 04:36.880
Secondly, there's no such thing
as ghosts or spirits.

04:36.914 --> 04:37.948
Right, Mike?

04:37.982 --> 04:40.283
Well, you know, I've traveled a lot,

04:40.318 --> 04:44.087
and every culture has some sort
of belief in the spirit world.

04:44.121 --> 04:46.089
So, dad, you believe in ghosts?

04:46.123 --> 04:47.757
I believe there's
a lot of things on earth

04:47.792 --> 04:49.109
that are unexplained.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.162
Okay, it's official. I am
more freaked out than Mandy.

04:52.196 --> 04:53.463
Oh, well, don't be.

04:53.481 --> 04:55.532
We're talking about
superstitions, which began

04:55.566 --> 04:58.068
because people needed to explain
things they didn't understand,

04:58.102 --> 05:00.253
but now we have science.

05:00.288 --> 05:04.674
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

05:04.709 --> 05:08.378
I am almost too scared
to text anyone about this.

05:09.413 --> 05:12.432
That's a perfect example.

05:12.466 --> 05:15.452
The glass moved because of
condensation underneath it.

05:15.486 --> 05:17.587
It's hydrodynamic lubrication.

05:17.622 --> 05:19.940
Viscous effects
generate shear stresses,

05:19.974 --> 05:21.558
and the surfaces lift apart.

05:21.592 --> 05:24.728
It's your basic Stribeck's curve.

05:24.762 --> 05:26.830
Stribeck--interesting man--
is a professor.

05:26.864 --> 05:30.267
He also was a-a ghost hunter,
and he ate small children.

05:36.357 --> 05:38.458
Hey, Kyle, what are you having?

05:38.509 --> 05:40.293
I'm on a budget.
P.B. And j.

05:40.344 --> 05:42.812
It's only 11 cents a sandwich
if I use the grape jelly

05:42.847 --> 05:46.149
where grapes aren't
an actual ingredient.

05:46.183 --> 05:49.235
Come on, get yourself
a sandwich. My treat. Go ahead.

05:49.270 --> 05:50.754
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

05:50.788 --> 05:53.690
I insist. I insist.
Try the chicken parm.

05:53.724 --> 05:55.158
Come on, you're a--
you're a young buck.

05:55.192 --> 05:58.645
You can handle her. Go ahead.
Molly, here. Uh-oh.

05:58.679 --> 06:01.798
Only have hundreds.
Rich man's curse.

06:03.367 --> 06:05.602
Can you spot me?
I'll get you back tomorrow.

06:05.636 --> 06:06.970
Yeah, okay.

06:07.004 --> 06:09.472
Hey, Pete, bring it up here!

06:09.507 --> 06:11.641
Can you get this one, too?
All right?

06:11.676 --> 06:15.745
Hey, birthday boy!
Here, a Sammy on me!

06:16.731 --> 06:20.150
This is 25, 50, 51...

06:20.184 --> 06:23.703
Sorry, that's a token.
That's 65...

06:23.738 --> 06:26.022
Boy, Vanessa got me
a great birthday gift this year.

06:26.057 --> 06:30.860
Yep, hopefully something you'll
be able to pass on to me again.

06:30.894 --> 06:34.781
Those--those improv classes
were <i>dynamite.</i>

06:36.233 --> 06:39.035
Come on. Shout out a location
and weather condition. Go ahead.

06:39.070 --> 06:41.738
No, thanks. Remember,
I saw your "showcase."

06:41.756 --> 06:44.307
All right.
Okay, what is this?

06:44.342 --> 06:45.709
It's a history of my neighborhood.

06:45.743 --> 06:47.177
History of the old neighborhood,
huh? All right.

06:47.211 --> 06:51.147
Let's see what this is about.
"Silver rush... grubstakes..."

06:51.182 --> 06:53.683
Mikey, I don't mean
to alarm you, but--

06:53.717 --> 06:54.651
I know, I know.
Eh?

06:54.685 --> 06:56.353
Two women died in the house.

06:56.387 --> 06:59.322
Were they in each others' arms?

06:59.357 --> 07:01.691
Mm?

07:01.726 --> 07:04.861
Anyway, the girls are
real freaked out about it.

07:04.895 --> 07:06.980
Hey, this ghost thing is not
gonna go away for your girls.

07:07.014 --> 07:08.765
You know, once this junk
gets stuck in your head,

07:08.799 --> 07:11.368
it's there forever.
And what about Vanessa?

07:11.402 --> 07:13.002
That woman's not afraid of anything.

07:13.037 --> 07:16.506
She had three breach babies
without drugs.

07:17.842 --> 07:20.110
Oh, but this is different.
This is the unknown.

07:20.144 --> 07:22.395
This is the paranormal.
This is the macabre.

07:22.446 --> 07:25.165
You didn't see those
three babies when they came out.

07:31.422 --> 07:34.357
So? Are you
having a good birthday?

07:34.392 --> 07:35.325
It's not over yet.

07:35.359 --> 07:37.494
Yeah?

07:37.528 --> 07:40.063
You think, uh, you think
the ghosts are watching us?

07:40.097 --> 07:42.699
Probably, so you'd better
bring your "a" game.

07:42.733 --> 07:43.700
Mm.

07:47.138 --> 07:48.238
We're sleeping.

07:49.507 --> 07:52.275
Yeah. Hi. Sorry.
We can't sleep.

07:52.309 --> 07:53.276
Well, try harder.

07:53.310 --> 07:55.028
Stop. What's the matter, sweetie?

07:55.079 --> 07:57.680
Okay, so I had
this nightmare about ghosts,

07:57.715 --> 07:59.682
so I got up,
and I went to check on him,

07:59.717 --> 08:02.318
and he was standing
bolt upright in his crib,

08:02.353 --> 08:07.991
and he said, <i>"mama,"</i> in this
really scary old lady voice.

08:08.025 --> 08:09.676
Oh, well, come on, come on.
Come into bed with us.

08:09.710 --> 08:10.677
Move over.

08:10.711 --> 08:12.262
You move over.
It's my birthday.

08:12.296 --> 08:14.264
Just move over.
Move over.

08:14.298 --> 08:17.434
Come on.
Ooh, sweetie pie. Ooh, yay.

08:17.468 --> 08:19.769
Ooh, let's get in the bed
with grandma.

08:21.138 --> 08:23.973
For the love of God.

08:24.007 --> 08:27.110
We heard footsteps in the hall.

08:27.144 --> 08:29.011
Oh, yeah, that was just me
coming in here.

08:29.029 --> 08:30.447
Good call. Move over.

08:30.481 --> 08:33.232
Come on, girls.
You're practically adults.

08:33.284 --> 08:35.735
Is Eve the only one
that can stay in her own room?

08:35.785 --> 08:38.688
There is
a poltergeist in my toilet.

08:38.722 --> 08:40.789
<i>What?</i>

08:40.825 --> 08:42.926
And strange noises and cold air.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.193
All right. Hop in.

08:44.211 --> 08:46.412
Yay!

08:46.464 --> 08:49.082
I know I was mocking everyone before,

08:49.133 --> 08:52.969
but somehow, alone in the dark,
it's not that funny.

08:53.003 --> 08:55.705
Oh, sweetie,
there's nothing to be scared of.

08:55.723 --> 08:57.640
Besides, this is fun, right, Mike?

08:57.675 --> 08:58.641
Yep.

08:58.676 --> 08:59.642
Hey.

08:59.677 --> 09:01.311
When I bought a 5-bedroom home,

09:01.345 --> 09:04.013
this is...
Kind of what I had in mind.

09:04.048 --> 09:06.316
You know,
I'm hanging on here by a cheek.

09:14.923 --> 09:16.590
Mr. Alzate?
Hmm?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.025
Sully was duck hunting,

09:18.059 --> 09:19.960
and his dog stepped on his gun

09:19.994 --> 09:23.030
and accidentally
shot him in the butt.

09:30.371 --> 09:32.906
There are no accidents, Kyle.

09:35.043 --> 09:38.178
Anyway, I'm collecting $10 a person,

09:38.196 --> 09:40.113
and we're gonna buy him
a doughnut to sit on

09:40.148 --> 09:43.050
and a hunting trophy for his dog.

09:43.084 --> 09:45.586
All right.

09:45.620 --> 09:46.853
I'll give $100.

09:46.888 --> 09:48.789
That's very generous, sir.

09:48.823 --> 09:49.990
Oh. I only have plastic.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.259
Do you take one of
these elite credit cards here?

09:52.293 --> 09:53.894
It's kind of cash only.

09:53.928 --> 09:57.130
- The can doesn't have a little swipy thing on it.
- I see.

09:58.199 --> 10:00.684
Uh, throw a c-note
in for me, will you?

10:00.735 --> 10:02.402
I'll get you back tomorrow.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.904
Yes, sir.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.639
Thank you.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.041
Mr. B?

10:08.075 --> 10:09.810
Oh, boy, is that for Sully?
Yeah.

10:09.844 --> 10:10.978
Man...

10:11.012 --> 10:15.165
That dog's the best shot
in his family.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.833
Um...

10:16.868 --> 10:20.087
Ed never has cash on him,
and he's always taking mine.

10:20.121 --> 10:21.888
I don't understand.
Isn't he rich?

10:21.923 --> 10:23.690
Yeah...

10:23.725 --> 10:24.858
It's a curious thing
about rich people--

10:24.892 --> 10:27.227
more money they have,
the less they carry.

10:29.230 --> 10:30.631
Kyle, he's a stand-up guy.
Just--just ask him.

10:30.665 --> 10:31.915
He'll give it to you.

10:31.966 --> 10:32.933
I can't.

10:32.967 --> 10:36.870
I come from a long line of doormats.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.338
I'm afraid to make him angry.

10:38.373 --> 10:41.374
I can't afford to lose this job.

10:41.392 --> 10:42.576
Then again...

10:42.610 --> 10:46.213
I can't afford to keep it, either.

10:46.247 --> 10:48.048
I'm in a real pickle here, sir.

10:54.489 --> 10:55.455
Dad, uh, this is Brenda.

10:55.490 --> 10:57.591
Hi.
She's a medium.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.860
Dad, she thinks
she can get rid of our ghosts.

10:59.894 --> 11:01.128
Yeah, not get rid of

11:01.162 --> 11:03.496
as much as understand
why they're still here

11:03.514 --> 11:06.066
and encourage them to leave.

11:08.236 --> 11:11.772
Well, good, so--so we got
the platinum package.

11:13.007 --> 11:13.940
Dad?

11:13.975 --> 11:17.277
What--what are you doing?

11:17.311 --> 11:19.112
You're the one
who believes in this stuff.

11:19.147 --> 11:21.381
The girls think
she can cleanse the house.

11:21.416 --> 11:24.284
And personally, I'm a big fan
of the placebo effect.

11:26.087 --> 11:28.655
Ooh, I'm getting a real hit
on something right here.

11:28.690 --> 11:31.575
An "a"--does anyone have
a person in their life

11:31.609 --> 11:34.227
whose name begins with an "a"?
You right there, miss?

11:34.295 --> 11:36.730
Aunt Jean! Oh, my God!
You're amazing.

11:38.700 --> 11:41.852
Everybody's aunt begins with an "a."

11:41.903 --> 11:44.337
Now I'm getting a "b."

11:44.372 --> 11:45.806
Dad, Beatrice!
That's the name

11:45.840 --> 11:48.141
of one of the two women
who died in our house.

11:48.176 --> 11:50.110
Ooh!

11:50.144 --> 11:52.045
Let me try this alphabetical thing--

11:52.080 --> 11:53.313
let me do this one.

11:53.347 --> 11:57.484
Oh, here it comes.
Oh, watch out. I...

11:57.518 --> 12:01.138
"C"! Cousin Claire.
This is freaky!

12:03.157 --> 12:05.926
I'm getting something else.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.994
Two women died in this house.

12:08.029 --> 12:09.763
Kristin just said that.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.198
She didn't say they died.

12:11.232 --> 12:12.766
Yes, she did.
She didn't.

12:12.784 --> 12:14.334
Yes, she did.

12:14.368 --> 12:17.771
One of them...

12:17.805 --> 12:19.306
Was...

12:19.340 --> 12:20.674
Beatrice.

12:22.376 --> 12:24.578
Again, not new information.

12:24.612 --> 12:26.613
And the second one is Alice.

12:26.647 --> 12:29.082
Okay. Nobody told her that.

12:29.117 --> 12:30.083
Mm-hmm.

12:30.118 --> 12:32.753
They died here... alone.

12:32.787 --> 12:34.087
Wait--what--what do you mean?

12:34.122 --> 12:36.623
I mean there was no one
here to comfort them.

12:36.657 --> 12:38.058
Oh, gosh, I...

12:38.092 --> 12:41.695
I hope that's not true.

12:41.729 --> 12:45.065
Are Alice
and Beatrice still here?

12:45.099 --> 12:47.067
They are.

12:47.101 --> 12:48.869
Alice!

12:48.903 --> 12:50.370
Beatrice!

12:53.274 --> 12:56.610
Your souls are free.
You can go.

12:56.644 --> 12:58.578
Cute gloves!

13:02.967 --> 13:04.584
Are--are you sure they didn't die

13:04.618 --> 13:06.452
- with--with family around them?
- No.

13:06.471 --> 13:07.454
Or...
No family.

13:07.488 --> 13:08.522
Distant relative...
Nope.

13:08.556 --> 13:10.457
- Or second cousin twice removed?
- No.

13:10.491 --> 13:13.426
- Anybody? Nobody was with them at all? Nothing?
- Nobody. Nope, alone.

13:13.461 --> 13:16.096
Wow, that's...
That's horrible.

13:16.130 --> 13:19.166
But we both decided
we don't believe in this.

13:21.185 --> 13:23.469
Yeah. Of course not.

13:23.488 --> 13:28.141
But if we did, did they
at least die peacefully?

13:28.176 --> 13:29.512
No.

13:34.820 --> 13:36.688
Hey, honey?
Hmm?

13:36.722 --> 13:39.090
That Brenda was quite a crackpot.

13:39.124 --> 13:42.260
But she put the girls' minds at ease.

13:42.294 --> 13:44.796
Maybe they'll leave us alone tonight.

13:47.383 --> 13:50.935
Yeah, but don't you think
it's kind of weird

13:50.970 --> 13:52.203
that she knew Alice's name?

13:52.237 --> 13:54.238
Well, maybe she read the same book.

13:54.273 --> 13:56.407
Apparently, it was almost free.

13:59.345 --> 14:02.780
You know--you know what area has
some really beautiful houses?

14:02.815 --> 14:04.348
Cherry creek.

14:04.366 --> 14:07.552
Yeah, cherry creek
has really nice houses.

14:07.586 --> 14:10.705
Yeah, so--so are you thinking
what--what I'm thinking?

14:10.739 --> 14:14.515
That our marriage has devolved
into mindless banter?

14:17.396 --> 14:18.963
Well, no,

14:18.998 --> 14:21.599
that we--we just go ahead and do it.

14:21.633 --> 14:23.668
I mean, we're--we're always
talking about moving.

14:23.702 --> 14:25.837
We never talk about moving.

14:25.871 --> 14:28.206
I think you're freaked out
about Beatrice and Alice.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.141
No. No.

14:30.175 --> 14:32.176
I'm not.

14:32.210 --> 14:34.062
Yeah, I am. A little.

14:34.096 --> 14:35.646
Honey, you're a scientist.

14:35.664 --> 14:37.705
I know what I am!

14:38.634 --> 14:41.686
But, Mike, Mike, listen...

14:41.720 --> 14:43.888
Two women died alone in this house.

14:43.922 --> 14:45.857
I mean, you know what they say--

14:45.891 --> 14:47.725
that--that things happen in threes.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.227
Look, you're not
gonna die alone, babe.

14:49.261 --> 14:51.095
We have kids.
That's the point.

14:51.130 --> 14:53.998
You know? They're gonna be here
for your last breath,

14:54.033 --> 14:58.136
and then get into a fistfight
over your jewelry.

14:58.170 --> 15:00.505
They'll move away,

15:00.539 --> 15:02.340
and you will be long dead...

15:02.374 --> 15:04.876
Wait a minute.
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

15:06.879 --> 15:09.414
I'm gonna die first, huh?

15:09.448 --> 15:11.882
It's weird how that comforts me.

15:11.900 --> 15:15.653
I'm sorry, honey, I just--it's...

15:15.671 --> 15:17.788
You know how dying alone

15:17.806 --> 15:20.274
- is--is my deepest, deepest fear.
- I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

15:20.309 --> 15:21.743
And I am just--
I am afraid it is destined

15:21.777 --> 15:24.195
to happen to me in this house.

15:25.597 --> 15:26.898
I understand.

15:26.932 --> 15:28.966
Those are your feelings, and you
have every right to them.

15:29.001 --> 15:31.402
Okay. Thanks, sweetie.

15:31.436 --> 15:33.337
I love you.
I love you, too.

15:33.372 --> 15:34.338
Oh, boy.

15:36.742 --> 15:38.042
Mm.

15:40.546 --> 15:41.479
Mike...

15:43.282 --> 15:45.716
It's not your birthday anymore.

15:52.474 --> 15:53.458
Hey. What are you guys watching?

15:53.492 --> 15:56.527
"Paranormal activity ii."

15:56.561 --> 16:00.264
Seriously?
After all that ghost stuff?

16:00.299 --> 16:01.899
Oh, no, we're done
with all our ghost stuff.

16:01.934 --> 16:05.000
These people, however, are screwed.

16:14.079 --> 16:15.379
Mom?
Hmm?

16:15.414 --> 16:17.381
Why are you staring at us?

16:17.416 --> 16:21.486
You guys are gonna live here
a long time, right?

16:21.520 --> 16:24.422
I will, 'cause when those two leave,

16:24.456 --> 16:25.823
I'm gonna knock down
their bedroom walls,

16:25.858 --> 16:27.725
turn it into a suite,
little gym, little juice bar,

16:27.759 --> 16:31.229
I'm not gonna go crazy.

16:31.263 --> 16:32.563
Hey, guys!
Everybody gather!

16:32.597 --> 16:34.665
Oh, you are. All right.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.501
Listen, I gotta show you something.

16:36.535 --> 16:38.019
Hey, dad, what are you doing?
We're watching that.

16:38.053 --> 16:39.804
Oh! The demon takes the baby.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.175
I just saved you
80 minutes of horror. Come on.

16:44.209 --> 16:45.309
I want you to see this.
Listen.

16:45.344 --> 16:47.211
No question, this week
has been exhausting.

16:47.229 --> 16:48.546
We're doing okay.

16:48.580 --> 16:49.981
I'm talking about for me.

16:50.015 --> 16:51.449
Ghosts, mediums...

16:51.483 --> 16:54.585
50 people in my bed.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.387
Now we're gonna learn a little
history about our house.

16:56.421 --> 16:57.755
We already know the history.

16:57.789 --> 16:59.690
No, this is the correct history.

16:59.725 --> 17:01.425
Honey, who are those people?

17:01.460 --> 17:04.462
- That is Beatrice Johnson, surrounded by her family.
- Oh.

17:04.496 --> 17:05.730
She was 84 years old.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.532
This picture was taken
two weeks before she died.

17:08.567 --> 17:10.101
Ah. She looks happy.

17:10.135 --> 17:12.435
Yeah. 'Cause she <i>was</i> happy.
You know how I know?

17:12.471 --> 17:15.772
I spent hours on the Internet,
I located her great-grandson,

17:15.807 --> 17:17.141
who's right here.

17:18.710 --> 17:21.145
Yeah...
Who lives in Boulder,

17:21.180 --> 17:22.246
and now looks like this.

17:22.281 --> 17:24.121
Oh, wow.
What--

17:25.784 --> 17:27.151
yeah.

17:27.185 --> 17:30.121
Anyway, he informed me

17:30.155 --> 17:33.224
that she in fact died
in this house very peacefully

17:33.258 --> 17:35.493
surrounded by family and friends.

17:35.527 --> 17:37.662
No. That's not
what Brenda said.

17:37.696 --> 17:39.096
Well, Brenda's an idiot, all right?

17:40.232 --> 17:42.700
This is Alice Tippett,

17:42.734 --> 17:44.969
surrounded by her husband,
children, and grandchildren.

17:45.003 --> 17:47.038
She, too, died peacefully,

17:47.072 --> 17:49.740
aged 76, in this house,
surrounded by loved ones.

17:49.775 --> 17:51.909
So if things
do come in threes, honey,

17:51.944 --> 17:54.312
you will be the third
in a line of women

17:54.346 --> 17:56.862
that have raised a happy family
here...

17:58.283 --> 17:59.984
In this house.

18:00.018 --> 18:03.020
♪

18:58.076 --> 18:59.593
Thank you.

18:59.628 --> 19:01.178
Thank you. Thank you
for going to all the trouble.

19:01.213 --> 19:02.596
I'd like to say it was no trouble,

19:02.631 --> 19:03.914
but it was a huge pain.

19:03.932 --> 19:06.350
Oh.

19:06.385 --> 19:08.219
Now I gotta go back to work.

19:08.253 --> 19:09.220
Why--why?

19:09.254 --> 19:10.421
'Cause I got nothing done today

19:10.439 --> 19:12.690
'cause I was doing this stupid stuff.

19:12.724 --> 19:15.893
Just remember--two deaths
and a kidnapping in a house

19:15.927 --> 19:16.894
don't make any difference.

19:16.928 --> 19:19.096
Kidnapping?
What kidnapping?

19:19.114 --> 19:20.364
I'll get back to that!

19:21.400 --> 19:22.300
Kidnapping?!

19:25.915 --> 19:27.665
So you have it?
That's good. All right.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.250
That's better. Mm-hmm.

19:29.285 --> 19:31.202
Wait.

19:33.222 --> 19:35.256
What happened to you, son?

19:35.291 --> 19:37.425
I went on an errand,
and I had to walk

19:37.459 --> 19:39.494
the last 4 miles back to work.

19:39.528 --> 19:42.864
Why did you do that?
It's very blustery out there!

19:42.898 --> 19:45.499
Because I ran out of gas.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.502
You ran out of gas?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.722
What's the matter with you?

19:50.773 --> 19:52.974
I mean, driving around on less
than half a tank of gas,

19:53.008 --> 19:54.809
and in the winter, is irresponsible.

19:54.843 --> 19:57.045
I'm not irresponsible.
I'm broke!

19:57.079 --> 19:58.479
You took all my money!

19:58.513 --> 20:00.114
You said,
"I'll get you back tomorrow,"

20:00.149 --> 20:04.752
and you never did!
You owe me $516!

20:06.922 --> 20:08.289
I'm kind of hovering over my body,

20:08.324 --> 20:10.208
watching this happen right now.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.160
Hey, Kyle, I apologize.

20:12.194 --> 20:15.713
I apologize. Your generosity
has not gone unnoticed.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.699
Also, Mike mentioned something to me.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.002
So I'm--I'm prepared
to pay you back your money.

20:21.036 --> 20:22.503
Just follow me. Come on.
Come on.

20:22.537 --> 20:25.423
Thank goodness. My rent
was due three days ago.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.375
Right here.

20:29.044 --> 20:31.045
Look at this.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.047
Hmm?

20:33.082 --> 20:34.749
What's this?

20:34.783 --> 20:38.736
This is a fine, handmade
trail riding saddle.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.055
That's what this is.
Worth a lot more than I owe you.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.241
It's...

20:43.275 --> 20:46.577
It's--it's just my way
of saying "I'm sorry."

20:46.612 --> 20:50.214
But I don't own a horse.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.499
Cash is fine.

20:51.533 --> 20:52.667
Cash?

20:52.701 --> 20:55.369
Cash you'll just spend
on something silly.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.839
Or food.

20:57.873 --> 21:01.909
No, no. A saddle you'll have forever.

21:01.944 --> 21:03.173
Happy trails.
