00:01.435 --> 00:03.102
<i> [narrator] there's nothing</i>
<i>  like ice mining.</i>

00:04.505 --> 00:07.072
<i>  It's the most dangerous game</i>
<i>  you'll ever play.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:10.175
<i>  If you're going to step up</i>
<i>  to the table.</i>

00:11.412 --> 00:12.411
<i>  You better know...</i>

00:15.216 --> 00:16.281
<i>  How to play your hand.</i>

00:16.550 --> 00:18.317
Argh!

00:18.319 --> 00:21.420
<i> [man] I'm betting</i>
<i>  everything I have</i>
<i>  on myself this winter.</i>

00:21.422 --> 00:24.556
<i>  But the only way</i>
<i>  to make big money</i>
<i>  is to risk it all.</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:29.661
I'm in the red so much that
right now I just need gold,
gold and then some more gold.

00:29.663 --> 00:34.333
<i> [vernon] with the claim</i>
<i>  I've got, I'm holding</i>
<i>  a monster of stackable chips.</i>

00:34.335 --> 00:38.337
Right there, it's cooper gold.
We've got to take advantage
of every minute.

00:38.339 --> 00:41.407
<i>  -Now it's time</i>
<i>  to break the bank.</i>
<i> -[man] whoo!</i>

00:41.409 --> 00:43.776
<i> [zeke] if I don't start making</i>
<i>  real gold this winter.</i>

00:43.778 --> 00:45.878
<i>  I won't have a seat</i>
<i>  at the table any more.</i>

00:45.880 --> 00:47.913
I want to, like, dive a ton.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.415
-Argh!
-Are you okay?

00:49.417 --> 00:50.916
[gurgling]

00:50.918 --> 00:53.218
<i> [man] never count out</i>
<i>  the wildcard.</i>

00:53.220 --> 00:54.953
Pizza delivery.
Put me to work.

00:54.955 --> 00:57.322
<i>  I might be the difference</i>
<i>  between winning and losing.</i>

00:57.324 --> 01:00.692
Yee-haw!
[laughing maniacally]

01:00.694 --> 01:02.728
my expansion
is just getting started.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.965
If you don't gamble,
you'll never win.
And I'm a gambling fool.

01:06.967 --> 01:07.866
<i>  When it all comes together.</i>

01:07.868 --> 01:09.701
Yee-haw!

01:09.703 --> 01:11.837
This game
will never be the same.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.105
[motor whirring]
[engine revving]

01:27.755 --> 01:29.354
[wind blowing]

01:33.727 --> 01:36.295
<i>  we got weather coming in.</i>
<i>  It's time to get some gold.</i>

01:39.266 --> 01:43.469
[narrator]
<i>  the worst winter in 100 years</i>
<i>  is forecast for nome.</i>

01:43.471 --> 01:49.408
<i>  As a series of blizzards</i>
<i>  are expected to relentlessly</i>
<i>  pound the bering sea.</i>

01:49.410 --> 01:53.946
But the man they call mr. Gold
shows no signs
of backing down.

01:54.849 --> 01:56.315
Ice is back!

01:57.618 --> 01:59.718
We're going to go and
check it out.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.855
We left off
on a really good spot,
with the myrtle.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.624
<i>  Hopefully,</i>
<i>  we can hit it again.</i>

02:05.626 --> 02:09.428
<i> [narrator] the top player</i>
<i>  in the nome gold mining game,</i>
<i>  shawn pomrenke,</i>

02:09.430 --> 02:12.865
<i>  has taken home</i>
<i>  the biggest pot,</i>
<i>  season after season.</i>

02:12.867 --> 02:17.336
<i>  But this winter,</i>
<i>  he may have made a bet</i>
<i>  he can't pay off.</i>

02:17.338 --> 02:19.705
[shawn]
<i>  this season's</i>
<i>  really important.</i>

02:19.707 --> 02:23.609
We've got to get as much time
on the bottom as possible.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.544
I'm expanding
my operation fast,

02:25.546 --> 02:27.713
but I'm in debt
up to my eyeballs.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.716
<i>  With buying the tomcod,</i>
<i>  the inland mine</i>

02:30.718 --> 02:32.317
<i>  and the upgrades</i>
<i>  on the myrtle.</i>

02:32.319 --> 02:35.120
<i>  I'm almost in it</i>
<i>  for $2 million.</i>

02:35.122 --> 02:38.857
<i>  This winter, I need</i>
<i>  at least 120 ounces</i>
<i>  to keep the ball rolling.</i>

02:38.859 --> 02:40.792
<i>  Otherwise,</i>
<i>  I won't make my payments</i>

02:40.794 --> 02:42.694
<i>  and everything</i>
<i>  will go bye-bye.</i>

02:42.696 --> 02:45.664
But I do have a plan
to pull it off.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.933
<i> [shawn] I believe there's</i>
<i>  a jackpot in</i>
<i>  that ancient river bed</i>

02:47.935 --> 02:50.402
<i>  that I was working</i>
<i>  this summer.</i>

02:50.404 --> 02:52.771
<i>  The material I was seeing</i>
<i>  tells me it's there.</i>

02:52.773 --> 02:55.841
This stuff looks amazing.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.075
<i> The drill logs say it's there.</i>

02:57.077 --> 02:58.577
It's gotta be there.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.112
<i>  It has to be there.</i>

03:00.814 --> 03:01.880
<i>  We're talking</i>
<i>  something special.</i>

03:01.882 --> 03:04.583
[chortling]
yeah!

03:04.585 --> 03:08.420
<i>  A giant concentration of gold</i>
<i>  in one spot.</i>

03:08.422 --> 03:11.190
And this winter
I'm betting big
that I can find it.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.198
We were out here this summer
and we did really well.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.667
This is where I'm gonna go.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.102
There's a pile of gold here,
somewhere.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.239
<i>  I can feel it in my bones.</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:34.346
What are you thinking, joel?

03:34.348 --> 03:37.683
-That looks like a good spot
to get in, huh?
-Yeah.

03:37.685 --> 03:41.820
<i>  They're predicting</i>
<i>  a nasty winter,</i>
<i>  so I'm not messing around.</i>

03:41.822 --> 03:44.756
<i>  I'm gonna bring in</i>
<i>  joe fullwood to help me out.</i>

03:44.758 --> 03:46.124
Joel's the best diver
out there.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.726
Well, besides me.

03:47.728 --> 03:52.764
<i>  If joe and I can't find</i>
<i>  that jackpot, well then,</i>
<i>  it just doesn't exist.</i>

03:52.766 --> 03:55.834
What do you think,
grab the auger and start
drilling some holes?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.970
-[shawn] get in the water?
-[joe] yeah that sounds good.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.174
[engine roaring]

04:13.921 --> 04:17.122
-[joe] cold out here.
-[shawn chuckling]

04:18.025 --> 04:19.424
[chuckling]

04:19.426 --> 04:22.194
this is the...
The worst part of it.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.798
-[shawn]
I don't have a choice, do I?
-[joe] no, no, no.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.969
-No way to do it
but to do it, eh? [laughing]
-[shawn] that's right.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.406
[engine spluttering]

04:44.785 --> 04:47.319
I feel like a girl
trying to get into
the skinny jeans.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.221
[joe] you ready?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.056
[shawn speaking]

04:51.058 --> 04:53.058
it's just like
my first time diving.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.193
Murky.

04:55.195 --> 04:58.997
Ice mining's no joke.
You gotta haul
all your gear out on the ice.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.065
<i>  Cut a ice hole.</i>

05:00.067 --> 05:03.101
<i>  And then dive under the ice</i>
<i>  to find some gold.</i>

05:03.103 --> 05:05.604
And if that's not enough
for you, the ice can shift

05:05.606 --> 05:11.276
<i>  and crumble up and send</i>
<i>  everything and everybody to</i>
<i>  the bottom of the bering sea.</i>

05:11.278 --> 05:14.846
But it's the name of the game
that we signed up to play.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.216
Better get your
big boy panties on if you want
to come play up here.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.152
[shawn speaking]

05:20.387 --> 05:22.187
[shawn speaking]

05:22.923 --> 05:24.356
[shawn speaking]

05:28.395 --> 05:30.228
[shawn] first dive
of the season.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.731
Feels good.

05:34.401 --> 05:37.135
I think we're gonna make
some money this winter.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.273
<i> [narrator] 10 miles east.</i>

05:45.546 --> 05:49.614
<i> Woah! Tokyo drift. [chuckling]</i>

05:49.616 --> 05:52.851
<i> [narrator] after stepping away</i>
<i> from the game for a few years.</i>

05:52.853 --> 05:56.555
<i>  Zeke tenhoff is following up</i>
<i>  on his experimental</i>
<i>  summer season,</i>

05:56.557 --> 06:00.425
<i>  with what he hopes will be</i>
<i>  a hot hand.</i>

06:00.427 --> 06:04.162
<i>  After rolling the dice</i>
<i>  with his groundbreaking</i>
<i>  sailboat dredge.</i>

06:04.164 --> 06:06.264
<i>  This winter he's going</i>
<i>  under the ice,</i>

06:06.266 --> 06:09.668
<i>  to start replenishing</i>
<i>  his bankroll.</i>

06:09.670 --> 06:14.473
What I want to do is,
prove to myself what I can do
with very little equipment.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.808
<i>  And just dive a ton.</i>

06:16.810 --> 06:19.845
This summer was cool, in that,
I got a sailboat dredge
in the water.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.513
<i>  It proved that it could work.</i>

06:21.515 --> 06:23.849
-[zeke] dude,
it's really fast.
-[man] yeah!

06:23.851 --> 06:26.651
<i>  And it reignited my passion</i>
<i>  for gold dredging again.</i>

06:26.653 --> 06:29.087
I love a sailboat dredge
so much.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.523
<i>  But I didn't get</i>
<i>  a whole lot of gold.</i>

06:31.525 --> 06:33.558
<i>  Luckily, I run</i>
<i>  a small operation.</i>

06:33.560 --> 06:36.928
<i>  So I don't need a whole lot</i>
<i>  of gold to keep afloat.</i>

06:36.930 --> 06:39.698
<i>  But if I don't get around</i>
<i>  eight ounces this winter,</i>

06:39.700 --> 06:41.967
my mining career
could be over.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.204
[zeke] brr. Holy [bleep].

06:46.206 --> 06:48.740
And my zipper's not working.
Whatever.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.276
[both] woo-hoo!

06:51.278 --> 06:54.880
<i>  Sam and raven weren't able</i>
<i>  to come back up</i>
<i>  and help me this winter.</i>

06:54.882 --> 06:58.817
-[zeke] how's it going?
-Trying to get that nut, bro.
[chuckling]

06:58.819 --> 07:00.285
so this winter I have
a whole new crew.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.689
Oh [bleep] bonus!

07:04.691 --> 07:06.825
<i> [zeke] I have my other</i>
<i>  younger brother, gabe.</i>

07:06.827 --> 07:07.959
[gabe] that one tasted weird.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.062
-Oh! Sell by 2017.
-[laughing]

07:11.064 --> 07:12.364
[zeke] [bleep], you serious?

07:12.366 --> 07:15.167
<i>  And his best friend shlomo.</i>

07:15.169 --> 07:18.270
<i>  And, also, gabe's dog stormy,</i>
<i>  who's a really cute dog.</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:19.671
[zeke] no! Ugh.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.541
Gabe and shlomo,
they don't have a whole lot of
mining experience,

07:22.543 --> 07:24.576
<i>  but, they're</i>
<i>  commercial fishermen,</i>

07:24.578 --> 07:29.114
they're used to pulling stuff
out of the ocean,
so I think it should work out.

07:30.050 --> 07:35.120
What I would like to do is,
make a trip down to the ice,

07:35.122 --> 07:38.023
and then, yeah,
I don't really know exactly
where we should start.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.758
I have some coordinates.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.493
It might take
a little bit of scouting.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.895
We should take the auger
and just, like,
drill some holes.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.630
-[gabe] yeah.
-[zeke] as far as
I'm concerned

07:45.632 --> 07:48.767
this is ready to, uh,
get pulled down,

07:48.769 --> 07:51.036
-[gabe] okay. Ready to move!
-[zeke] onto the ice.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.306
[engine revving]

08:00.280 --> 08:04.616
this winter is forecasted
to be really stormy
and rowdy and rough.

08:04.618 --> 08:09.254
<i>  And, so, we're gonna set up</i>
<i>  close to town</i>
<i>  on the west beach claim.</i>

08:10.557 --> 08:13.391
<i>  This way we'll be able to</i>
<i>  stay out on the ice</i>
<i>  until the last minute</i>

08:13.393 --> 08:15.026
<i>  because we're super close</i>
<i>  to town.</i>

08:15.028 --> 08:17.429
Yeah!
[whip cracking]

08:17.431 --> 08:21.199
<i>  mostly, I have to</i>
<i>  dive non-stop because</i>
<i> I need to make up for the gold</i>

08:21.201 --> 08:23.802
that I didn't get last summer.
It's imperative.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.204
[engine roaring]

08:28.675 --> 08:34.713
[gabe] have you ever seen
a better ice mining sled?
These things are incredible.

08:34.715 --> 08:38.517
You can just [bleep]
jerk 'em over anything
and they just bop bop. So fun.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.119
I'm gonna auger a hole.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.322
Then we'll put the camera down
to make sure that
there's cobble right here.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.892
[engine starting]

08:46.894 --> 08:50.195
the first order of business
is to drill holes
and search with the camera

08:50.197 --> 08:52.230
to find a juicy place to dive.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.599
[drilling]

08:54.601 --> 08:57.235
we're looking for
rocks and cobble,
that's where the gold is.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.404
<i>  If we just find sand,</i>
<i>  it's no bueno.</i>

09:00.073 --> 09:00.972
[whirring]

09:00.974 --> 09:02.240
[zeke] damn!

09:03.243 --> 09:05.410
Let's see if we got,
uh, cobble.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.145
[splashing]

09:10.417 --> 09:12.117
[zeke] that's greasy sand,
isn't it?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.686
[gabe]
<i>  we're right on the edge.</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:17.022
-[zeke] dude, this is [bleep]
-[gabe] dude, I don't know,
that looks like some of that,

09:17.024 --> 09:19.958
like, murky, like, weird,
like, goopy stuff,
you what I'm saying?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.126
[zeke] oh, yeah!

09:21.128 --> 09:22.394
Technical nomenclature.

09:23.864 --> 09:27.265
[zeke] damn!
It looks like sand.
Gonna have to move.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.100
This is not gonna work.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.269
[drilling]

09:36.076 --> 09:37.175
[splashing]

09:37.411 --> 09:38.343
sandy!

09:40.080 --> 09:41.346
[beeping]

09:43.884 --> 09:45.083
[zeke]sand.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.319
[whirring]

09:48.121 --> 09:49.154
sand.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.890
Find any cobbles?

09:51.892 --> 09:53.425
Not yet. It's all sand.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.193
Mother[bleep].

09:55.862 --> 09:56.695
[bleep]

09:56.697 --> 09:58.296
[both laugh]

10:02.836 --> 10:04.603
<i> [zeke] there's some rocks</i>
<i>  down here in this hole.</i>

10:04.605 --> 10:06.004
<i> [gabe] yeah?</i>

10:06.006 --> 10:08.773
<i> [zeke] but for some reason</i>
<i>  the ice is super thick</i>
<i>  over here.</i>

10:08.775 --> 10:12.010
Let's see if we can find some
thinner ice around here.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.280
<i> [zeke] the ideal ice for</i>
<i>  our operation would be</i>

10:15.282 --> 10:18.183
from about
two to three feet thick.

10:18.185 --> 10:23.622
<i>  If it gets any thicker than</i>
<i>  that then it gets really hard</i>
<i>  to punch holes through and</i>

10:23.624 --> 10:25.890
I wanna hit the ground
running this season.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.126
<i> [zeke] just a bunch of dirty</i>
<i>  sand right here man.</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:31.329
Okay, well, I think
that sounds like
that's our boy.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.033
<i> [zeke] well, oh damn.</i>

10:36.103 --> 10:37.602
<i>  Sand!</i>

10:37.604 --> 10:38.970
<i> [gabe] what the [bleep]!</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:40.572
<i>  Where is the one that</i>
<i>  had the cobble [bleep]?</i>

10:40.574 --> 10:41.906
<i> [shlomo] few ones</i>
<i>  are over there.</i>

10:41.908 --> 10:43.775
<i> -[zeke] no--</i>
<i> -that one, it's that one.</i>

10:43.777 --> 10:44.743
-Which one?
-That one.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.777
<i> [gabe] is that a hole?</i>

10:45.779 --> 10:47.646
<i> [zeke] what in the</i>
<i>  [bleep] happened?</i>

10:47.648 --> 10:50.215
-Is that sand?
<i> -[zeke] yeah, it's sand!</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:54.819
Well, we, uh, kinda forgot
which hole we had cobble at.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.354
This is a really
dumb problem.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.923
<i> [zeke] there's holes</i>
<i>  everywhere and I don't</i>
<i>  know which one is which.</i>

10:58.925 --> 11:02.661
Every minute we can't find
the holes with cobbles in it,
we're losing money.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.630
-Nooo!
-[laughs]

11:05.632 --> 11:08.066
uh, okay there's...
I don't know where that
hole was man!

11:08.068 --> 11:08.933
Dude I'm telling you
over here.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.969
Okay well just go
over there then [bleep].

11:10.971 --> 11:12.804
<i> [zeke] or maybe</i>
<i>  I was hallucinating.</i>

11:12.806 --> 11:16.675
<i>  It's like something I've done</i>
<i>  before, I'm like, making it</i>
<i>  more complicated for myself</i>

11:16.677 --> 11:19.911
or am I actually just getting
dumber as I get older?

11:19.913 --> 11:22.313
<i>  We will have this</i>
<i>  resolved, shortly.</i>

11:30.924 --> 11:33.858
<i> [kris] uh, what excites me</i>
<i>  about this ice mining season?</i>

11:33.860 --> 11:37.595
[bleep] I hate ice mining
let me tell you.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.665
<i>  With characteristic</i>
<i>  optimism, this winter,</i>

11:40.667 --> 11:44.002
<i>  captain kris kelly</i>
<i>  is upping the ante.</i>

11:44.805 --> 11:46.538
<i> [kris] so I went down</i>
<i>  to california,</i>

11:46.540 --> 11:50.175
I got a brand new eight-inch
operation on credit.

11:50.177 --> 11:53.344
<i>  Right now I need to</i>
<i>  make the money to pay</i>
<i>  for everything.</i>

11:53.346 --> 11:58.950
But I know I'm gonna pull
the hail mary path out and
win the game this year.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.487
<i>  In order to keep my seat at</i>
<i>  the table, I had to upgrade</i>
<i>  some of my equipment.</i>

12:02.489 --> 12:03.855
<i>  All of my equipment.</i>

12:03.857 --> 12:07.092
So why not go for broke
with a top notch operation.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.262
<i>  I got two</i>
<i>  23 horsepower pump.</i>

12:11.865 --> 12:14.232
<i>  I got a brand new</i>
<i>  air compressor.</i>

12:15.402 --> 12:17.402
<i>  Hand crafted</i>
<i>  eight inch nozzle.</i>

12:17.404 --> 12:20.405
<i>  A new flare,</i>
<i>  new water heater.</i>

12:20.407 --> 12:23.374
<i>  I got a brand new top of the</i>
<i>  line three stage suice box.</i>

12:23.376 --> 12:25.710
<i>  That will save my season.</i>

12:25.712 --> 12:30.615
<i>  All totaling over</i>
<i>  15,000 dollars which is an</i>
<i>  amazing irish deal.</i>

12:30.617 --> 12:32.951
<i>  Add in the expenses to</i>
<i>  maintain it, I need at least</i>

12:32.953 --> 12:35.687
<i>  25 ounces</i>
<i>  to pay this all of.</i>

12:35.689 --> 12:39.224
No pressure, 25 ounces?
Bam! I got this.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.596
I'm in the red so much
this year, it's disgusting.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.731
<i> It's just money, money, money.</i>

12:46.733 --> 12:51.936
So right now I just need
gold, gold, gold, gold and
then some more gold.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.973
Last summer I thought
I was gonna hit the
mother load in elim.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.011
[bleep]

13:00.013 --> 13:02.213
<i>  we're going home</i>
<i>  in utter defeat.</i>

13:02.716 --> 13:05.817
<i>  But elim was a disaster.</i>

13:05.819 --> 13:08.720
So I gotta get on big gold
this winter. We gotta
get on it, fast!

13:08.722 --> 13:10.755
So where we going,
out to mccully?

13:10.757 --> 13:13.625
Yeah, we're gonna go to
chris's and check out
his operations.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.761
Find out where we're
gonna go, check out the ice.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.363
-Okay, well let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.133
[motor revving]

13:43.390 --> 13:44.989
[motors stop]

13:46.560 --> 13:47.992
[kris] what's up buddy?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.061
-You made it!
-I made it [bleep].

13:50.063 --> 13:51.729
I just came
to scan my area.

13:51.731 --> 13:52.864
[laughing]

13:52.866 --> 13:55.834
last season working with
james on the mistress,

13:55.836 --> 13:57.535
we worked on
dave mccully's claim.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.904
<i>  That was a great opportunity.</i>
<i>  I made some money.</i>

13:59.906 --> 14:02.607
<i>  Digging up gold</i>
<i>  on the bering sea!</i>

14:02.609 --> 14:05.610
So we're heading back
out there to mine this winter.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.880
<i> [kris] chris mccully also has</i>
<i>  an ice mining operation</i>
<i>  right here.</i>

14:08.882 --> 14:12.217
And he says he's gonna
give me some damn good spots.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.518
<i> [kris] so where are we going?</i>

14:13.520 --> 14:16.287
[chris] well, I was thinking,
I was eyeballing
your spot already.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.957
It's gotta be right
over there,
south... South west

14:18.959 --> 14:20.792
towards that way
about 200 feet.

14:20.794 --> 14:23.094
<i> [kris] nice.</i>
<i>  Lead the way, chris.</i>

14:29.135 --> 14:31.269
Hey! That's what
I need to hear!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.774
[both laughing]

14:36.776 --> 14:41.346
right now this is perfect. If
chris says this is a good spot
it's gonna be a good spot.

14:41.348 --> 14:45.083
<i>  So andy's on his way</i>
<i>  right now, we're gonna</i>
<i>  get my equipment and</i>

14:45.085 --> 14:48.353
get it hauled out there.
Then I can start making money
instead of just spending it.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.189
I know!

14:51.191 --> 14:54.659
We're standing here.
Chris says now it's an hour
right underneath our feet.

14:54.694 --> 14:55.793
Oh, that's neat.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.195
-Yeah, well you know--
-for sure?

14:57.197 --> 14:58.296
[all laughing]

15:01.167 --> 15:02.333
yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.969
<i> [kris] I'm gonna</i>
<i>  insulate my box.</i>

15:06.640 --> 15:07.872
<i> [kris] I'm gonna insulate</i>
<i>  the [bleep] out of it.</i>

15:07.874 --> 15:09.607
<i> [chris] ice is your enemy!</i>

15:09.609 --> 15:11.976
<i> [kris] ice is my enemy,</i>
<i>  I know that.</i>

15:19.786 --> 15:21.853
[zeke] did I drop my
tape measure in the ice hole?

15:21.855 --> 15:23.388
[chuckles]
I think I might have.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.924
There wasn't one
under here.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.959
-What the hell!
-Stormy's been known to
run off with it.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.028
Damn stormy!
Where's my tape measure.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.296
[chuckles]

15:31.298 --> 15:34.532
[narrator]
<i>  intent on improving on</i>
<i>  their summer output,</i>

15:34.534 --> 15:40.004
<i>  zeke and his crew doggedly</i>
<i>  put in the finishing touches</i>
<i>  on their operation.</i>

15:40.006 --> 15:42.540
I like that it's hot tub
shaped. It's enticing.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.841
[laughing]

15:43.843 --> 15:46.811
it took us a hot minute
but we found the hole
with the cobble.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.414
<i>  So now it's about getting</i>
<i>  on the gold and getting</i>

15:49.416 --> 15:51.950
<i>  as many hours on the box</i>
<i>  as we possibly can.</i>

15:51.952 --> 15:54.285
Or honestly, this could be
my last mining season.

15:54.754 --> 15:55.887
Yeah!

15:55.889 --> 15:57.155
All right stormy,
get to work.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.957
[whining]

15:59.859 --> 16:01.225
ugh!

16:02.796 --> 16:04.462
<i>  Gabe and shlomo are</i>
<i>  great guys to have around</i>

16:04.464 --> 16:06.898
but they haven't done
a whole lot of mining.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.233
I just need to focus on
getting these little things
done and everything

16:09.235 --> 16:12.003
and I can't really
do this and do that.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.474
Mm!

16:17.744 --> 16:20.611
I have so many little
chores to do that require
ice mining experience

16:20.613 --> 16:23.214
and I... I can't
do it all myself.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.150
So I called the only guy
that I know has
nothing else to do.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.053
[motor whirring]

16:33.393 --> 16:34.993
<i> -[steve] hey zeke!</i>
<i> -Hi steve, how's it going?</i>

16:34.995 --> 16:38.730
-Great! How about you?
-It's going all right.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.498
<i> [narrator] every poker game</i>
<i>  has it's wild card, and this</i>

16:40.500 --> 16:43.768
<i>  fleet has theirs</i>
<i>  in steve riedel.</i>

16:43.770 --> 16:48.339
<i>  Who spent years</i>
<i>  unsuccessfully trying to</i>
<i>  start his own operation</i>

16:48.341 --> 16:52.877
<i>  and is now desperately</i>
<i>  looking to gain a</i>
<i>  foothold this winter.</i>

16:52.879 --> 16:56.748
So I'm thinking if your
saw is long enough,
you might be able to just

16:56.750 --> 16:57.815
-cut...
-Yeah.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.151
...Like a block out here
and then you slide

17:00.153 --> 17:01.719
<i>  -that block out.</i>
<i>  -Slide it over.</i>

17:01.721 --> 17:04.222
<i> [zeke] you never really know</i>
<i>  what you're gonna get</i>
<i>  when you bring steve</i>

17:04.224 --> 17:06.824
<i>  onboard your operation.</i>
<i>  He can be really difficult</i>
<i>  sometimes but</i>

17:06.826 --> 17:09.594
sometimes he can be really
on point and really brilliant.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.196
So it's a high risk,
high reward situation.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.998
But I'm willing to take
the chance with it.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.802
Okay well, one way or
the other we'll get a
hole cut here and, uh,

17:17.804 --> 17:19.170
we'll get you under water.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.405
<i> [zeke] that's fantastic.</i>

17:21.007 --> 17:23.341
[saw whirring]

17:29.416 --> 17:31.149
[steve] ah-ha ha!

17:31.151 --> 17:33.051
Whoo-hoo! That's it!

17:33.053 --> 17:36.387
See. Woo-hoo!

17:36.389 --> 17:38.423
<i> [steve] I think we're ready.</i>

17:38.425 --> 17:40.391
<i>  We're gonna be in the water</i>
<i>  as soon as zeke gets</i>
<i>  his sweat suit on.</i>

17:57.477 --> 18:01.412
<i> [zeke] mining is way more</i>
<i>  dangerous in the winter</i>
<i>  than it is in the summer.</i>

18:01.414 --> 18:04.682
<i>  It's freezing and there's</i>
<i>  a giant sheet of ice</i>
<i>  above your head.</i>

18:04.684 --> 18:06.684
<i>  And it's been a few years</i>
<i>  since I've done this.</i>

18:06.686 --> 18:08.820
I'm honestly really
nervous about it.

18:08.822 --> 18:11.823
I'm... It's... It's a
scary thing to do.
But I need to get

18:11.825 --> 18:14.092
<i>  under the ice and I need to</i>
<i>  start looking for gold.</i>

18:14.194 --> 18:15.726
<i> [steve] you good?</i>

18:15.995 --> 18:20.164
Pretty excited to like, go
dive in that hole, but it
does look kinda chilly.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.440
[breathing heavily]

18:30.677 --> 18:32.009
<i> [zeke] ah-ha ha!</i>

18:32.979 --> 18:34.278
<i>  It's brisk and refreshing.</i>

18:37.016 --> 18:38.182
<i>  All right!</i>

18:39.886 --> 18:41.219
<i>  This looks familiar.</i>

18:43.556 --> 18:45.323
[gabe] how you feeling?

18:46.993 --> 18:50.094
<i> [zeke] I'm feeling good.</i>
<i>  It's dark and spooky</i>
<i>  down here.</i>

18:52.732 --> 18:54.365
All right, I'm on the bottom.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.301
[gabe] hi man,
how's it look down there?

18:59.672 --> 19:03.641
<i> [zeke] it looks like there's</i>
<i>  kind of like, a reef of</i>
<i>  cobbles like, heavy rocks.</i>

19:03.643 --> 19:05.776
<i>  And a lot of murk</i>
<i>  over to the left.</i>

19:05.778 --> 19:09.180
<i>  It's kind of like a sort of</i>
<i>  a circular little eddy.</i>

19:09.182 --> 19:11.983
<i>  Where the... It looks like</i>
<i>  the cobble and, uh,</i>

19:12.619 --> 19:14.218
<i>  hardpan meet.</i>

19:16.122 --> 19:19.090
<i>  So I think the gold</i>
<i>  might be collecting there.</i>

19:20.493 --> 19:22.126
<i> [gabe] got ya, got ya!</i>

19:26.900 --> 19:29.066
<i> [zeke] yeah, there's...</i>
<i>  There's gold here.</i>

19:29.536 --> 19:31.235
[gabe]
how's the gold look?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.305
<i> [zeke] and I want to try</i>
<i>  to like,</i>
<i>  wrench it.</i>

19:34.307 --> 19:37.909
For a while before
the storm hits.

19:37.911 --> 19:41.245
Yeah, we might as well
pound it as hard as possible
until we gotta leave.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.014
[shawn] that I can do.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.284
It's what god put me
here for, apparently.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.252
Well, let's do it.
I like that plan.

19:58.131 --> 20:00.398
<i> [narrator] the first</i>
<i>  of a barrage</i>
<i>  of blizzards this winter</i>

20:03.570 --> 20:05.336
<i>  But ten miles west of nome...</i>

20:09.943 --> 20:11.876
<i>  So how's it going</i>
<i>  down there, shawn?</i>

20:11.878 --> 20:15.713
Well, it feels good to be back
on the bottom.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.348
How's it looking
for your first dive?

20:17.917 --> 20:20.117
Not the king of ace again.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.321
Not seeing a whole lot
of color.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.191

20:31.097 --> 20:32.163
Here we go.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.307
Suction's good.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.643
Getting bored.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.079
A pretty nice, easy
working ground.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.915
Ideal for a small dredge
like this.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.316
How's it looking down there?

20:53.886 --> 20:58.122
Nice black material,
maybe about six inches thick.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.793
Nice little patches of rock
sticking out.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.762
Hell yeah, I like the sound
of it.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.998
You seeing any gold
on top of that?

21:07.967 --> 21:10.201
There's sand covering
the gravel.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.304
Then the material
turns yellow.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.108
Yeah, I'm seeing
some color now.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.313
Seeing gold on the first dive.
Yeah!

21:22.849 --> 21:24.015
Woo-hoo!

21:25.051 --> 21:27.018
[shawn] oh [bleep] yeah!

21:27.020 --> 21:28.352

<i>  Yeah, it's good to hear</i>

21:35.928 --> 21:39.096
I don't think anybody's looked
around over here.

21:40.833 --> 21:44.235
Might be a lot more gold
on this claim
than everybody thinks.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.937
<i> - Nice.</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

21:48.041 --> 21:50.041

22:12.565 --> 22:14.865
I was grabbing it.
I'm still grabbing it.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.702
<i>  Kris kelly is rushing</i>
<i>  to get his new</i>

22:17.704 --> 22:20.538
<i>  top of the line operation</i>
<i>  on the ice.</i>

22:20.540 --> 22:23.407
<i>  But, some assembly</i>
<i>  is required.</i>

22:23.409 --> 22:25.343
All brand new equipment,
like christmas.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.880
<i> [kris] I may have gone</i>
<i>  a little nuts this year,</i>

22:29.882 --> 22:32.717
but it's about time
the kellys' riding
with some style.

22:32.719 --> 22:36.287
<i> [kris] it feels great</i>
<i>  to finally get</i>
<i>  my first brand new system.</i>

22:36.289 --> 22:38.689
Even if I'm in debt
up to my ass.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.758
<i> [kris] now we have to</i>
<i>  put it together before</i>
<i>  the storm hits.</i>

22:40.760 --> 22:43.027
Or this might be a bet
I can't cover.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.030
[kris] hey, let's get started,
everybody.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.470
-Push, push, push.
-There you go.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.238
We got a brand new
water heater.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.508
I need you guys to
really take care
of this tool.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.945
And I'm looking right at you
when I'm saying that, turtle.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.814
This operation is much bigger
than what we've used
in the past.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.950
So, I'm expanding my team.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.918
I'm bring out my buddy,
turtle.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.722
And I need to bring in james,
the captain of the mistress.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.424
So I think I'm gonna do well,
for sure.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.060
Come on, help me grab this.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.195
It's heavy as [bleep].

23:19.031 --> 23:20.965
We still got a mountain-full
of work.

23:27.807 --> 23:32.410
So in shack number one,
I've the two 23 horse tank
power pump engine.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.146
Move on to shack number two.

23:35.148 --> 23:38.916
We got the hot water system,
all brand new, of course,
on one side.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.285
And we've got
the air compressor
on another side.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.789
Move on to
the communications shack.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.124
I consider this
an enormous upgrade.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.126
So, the window frame.

23:49.162 --> 23:52.563
I know that looks like
a simple piece of wood to
a lot of people, but for us,

23:52.565 --> 23:54.732
that's a difference of another
20 degrees,

23:54.734 --> 23:57.268
and the heat staying
inside my shed.

23:58.571 --> 24:01.539
So it's not like when you buy
this stuff, everything
is pre-built.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.975
This whole operation has to be
put together by us.

24:06.779 --> 24:10.181
It's a big deal but the
<i> creme de la creme is something</i>
<i> I came up with myself.</i>

24:10.283 --> 24:12.950
-Pick it up.
-Yay!

24:12.952 --> 24:16.120
<i> [kris] an insulated box,</i>
<i>  to keep the slooze box</i>
<i>  from freezing.</i>

24:16.355 --> 24:18.155
I call it, the coffin.

24:18.324 --> 24:19.957
[eerie music playing]

24:22.862 --> 24:26.230
when my brother dies,
I'm shifting this down to
wherever he is,

24:26.232 --> 24:28.666
and I'm burying his ass
in this.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.402
[kris] its mainly the height
that I'm worrying about
at the moment.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.705
Oh look that's [bleep]
something not done.

24:34.707 --> 24:38.108
We're gonna have to
add a stringer.
Andy, cut that wood.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.687
-[kris] hey, you're [bleep]
fired.
-What?

24:49.689 --> 24:51.689
Okay, I'll do this, sorry,
I didn't mean to get upset.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.725
Just 'cause, man, you have no
carpentry skills at all.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.161
You know you don't take it
like this and do it.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.229
-No, you take it from the--
-yeah you do.

24:58.231 --> 25:01.031
-Take it from the other end.
-Guys, what's it matter.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.401
It doesn't matter [bleep].
I'll do it.

25:04.403 --> 25:06.437
I'll do it. I will do it
myself.

25:06.439 --> 25:10.007
Look, I asked andy, that lazy
[bleep] to do this.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.478
I asked him to cut one board
for me real fast, I gave him
the measurements.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.847
There's two of them,
they're capable.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.949
I've pretty much done
everything else today myself.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.252
I told you to do this.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.487
Why can't you--
why do you--

25:23.923 --> 25:27.458
-why can't somebody else? Why
does it always have to be me?
-What is always you?

25:27.460 --> 25:28.726
What is always you?

25:28.728 --> 25:31.295
[kris] go home then.
[andy] all right. Whatever.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.899
I tell that guy to do
a simple ass
little [bleep] job.

25:34.901 --> 25:39.069
He does one a day. He thinks
that he's a [bleep]
accomplishment.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.107
It's gonna be a long month.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.345
[kris] we're ready
to rock n roll.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.881
This is the nicest operation.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.751
I don't even--
it's so nice I don't even
think it belongs to us.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.319
It's not really
the kelly style.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.821
Sorry everybody.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.791
Kind of in a bad mood today
trying to push together doing
all of these last little bits.

26:00.793 --> 26:01.458
Wait till andy didn't--

26:01.460 --> 26:02.860
[bleep] andy.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.194
We need to get out there
and start getting gold.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.063
God willing, everything will
work out.

26:06.966 --> 26:11.068
<i> [kris] if I can't make it work</i>
<i>  with everything brand new I'm</i>
<i>  gonna have to quit mining.</i>

26:11.070 --> 26:13.938
<i>  I need to go get a job</i>
<i>  at mcdonald's or something.</i>

26:25.851 --> 26:28.218
How's it going
down there, shawn?

26:28.220 --> 26:30.187
<i>  Man, the gold's so good</i>
<i>  down here.</i>

26:32.959 --> 26:36.260
I mean, you know,
we're getting
a whole bunch of gold.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.294
<i>  Right.</i>

26:38.731 --> 26:39.697
Sucking it up.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.800
<i>  Which direction you reckon</i>
<i>  you're in?</i>

26:42.802 --> 26:45.069
The gold's headed
to the north.

26:45.871 --> 26:49.306
But, I'm all
stretched out here.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.642
I'm thinking we're gonna have
to move the dredge.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.311
All right, maybe we'll start
prepping a new hole
over there.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.115
Yeah, let's go ahead
and get this thing moved.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.817
<i>  I'm coming up.</i>

26:59.819 --> 27:03.153
Boo-yah! I'll get taylor
and sasha to shovel in
a new hole.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.631
I think this is the pay streak
that leads to
that huge jackpot.

27:13.633 --> 27:17.034
The plan is to move
everything about 20 feet.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.203
<i> [shawn] put joe down</i>
<i>  and hopefully,</i>
<i>  he can get on it.</i>

27:30.216 --> 27:33.384
But it looks like
mother nature's not gonna go
along with my plan.

27:35.588 --> 27:36.420
This blows.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.756
Yeah, the storm's here
way earlier.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.925
-They said we had till Sunday.
-That's what I thought.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.427
[shawn] well, I think
it's here today.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.766
<i> [shawn] they weren't kidding</i>
<i>  about this winter.</i>

27:48.768 --> 27:50.634
This first storm's hitting
earlier than I expected.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.469
And its brutal.

27:52.471 --> 27:56.540
<i>  Makes moving to a new spot,</i>
<i>  or even mining impossible.</i>

27:56.542 --> 27:59.643
I've been in this game
long enough to know when not
to push my luck.

27:59.645 --> 28:02.179
<i>  And now it's time</i>
<i>  to pull off the ice.</i>

28:03.883 --> 28:06.950
-Let's get the hell outta here
sounds good.
-Yes boss.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.228
<i> [narrator] while mr. Gold,</i>
<i>  that likes to fold.</i>

28:19.799 --> 28:21.165
<i>  10 miles east</i>

28:21.167 --> 28:24.168
<i>  another member of the fleet</i>
<i>  goes all in.</i>

28:24.904 --> 28:27.004
It's not that bad yet.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.373
No matter what, we're getting
on the ice today.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.342
If not today, it's right
[bleep] now today.

28:37.583 --> 28:40.751
[kris] the update is,
wind's picking up,
snow's picking up.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.554
But I don't care about
any of those factors.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.823
Right now I got people
who are breathing down
my neck.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.058
I gotta get out there
and make some gold.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.729
So we're not giving up yet,
I mean--

28:51.731 --> 28:55.733
we can still see
for like a mile, we're not in
whiteout conditions.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.001
[kris] I've been in
a lot worse than this.

29:01.307 --> 29:04.007
Go inside outta the weather,
have a conference.

29:05.111 --> 29:09.513
With this massive debt
hanging over our heads,
we have no time to waste.

29:09.515 --> 29:13.817
We busted out butts getting
everything assembled, but we
can't get it there ourselves.

29:13.819 --> 29:17.688
So I need my buddy,
diesel don to pull everything
out with his track truck.

29:17.690 --> 29:21.191
I know don's not gonna let
a little snow get in his way.

29:21.861 --> 29:24.461
This storm came up faster
than its supposed to have.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.830
It wasn't supposed
to be like this till tomorrow.

29:26.832 --> 29:30.601
Going out like this, knowing
it's going to get worse,
is probably not

29:30.603 --> 29:32.536
the smartest thing
we could try and do.

29:32.538 --> 29:35.172
Fact of the matter is
it's just stupid.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.744
No, it's not stupid.
It'd mean we're only going
seven miles out of town.

29:40.746 --> 29:44.815
You know, you see,
absolutely no definition.
Everything's wide out there.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.884
You can run into
a big old block of ice
sitting in front of you

29:46.886 --> 29:49.386
and not even know it
till you come to a stop.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.789
I'm not in a rush
to become a statistic.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.724
No.

29:53.726 --> 29:57.094
I think the best thing is just
let's wait
till the weather clears.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.196
Once we get an opening,
launch.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.266
Yeah, okay.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.702
You know,
I'm kind of bummed out.

30:05.704 --> 30:09.139
It's depressing
and it's a let-down,
but it is what it is.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.075
Thank you very much
for trying.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.410
Yup, okay.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.913
[wind blowing]

30:15.915 --> 30:21.151
the blizzard came up on us
and now it's impossible
to get out there.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.686
It still really wish
we would have went.

30:22.688 --> 30:25.789
But
I can't make everybody out.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.724
As soon as we get a break
in the weather,
we're going,

30:27.726 --> 30:29.860
no matter
what the situation is.

30:29.862 --> 30:30.994
Just a little bit better
than this, though.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.796
[wind blowing]

30:32.798 --> 30:33.964
let's get the [bleep]
outta here.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.365
What a waste of time.

<i>  who hasn't cashed out.</i>

30:49.081 --> 30:51.949
The wind's really started
to get bitchy up here.
It's picking up.

33:17.830 --> 33:18.528
it's super hot.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.097
Right on, man.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.501
He told us
to get out of there,
so we can get out of here.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.003
[whirring]

33:26.005 --> 33:28.138
yeah, I'll probably
be finished with this hole,

33:28.140 --> 33:30.040
within the next
couple of hours.

33:32.911 --> 33:34.277
[blizzard blowing]

[wind blowing]

33:38.817 --> 33:40.050
[motor running]

33:41.687 --> 33:43.253
[steve]
the storm is picking up.

33:43.956 --> 33:46.156
We may not
last very long here.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.925
Wind's picked up
about 10 minutes ago.

33:48.961 --> 33:50.560
[wind blowing]

33:50.562 --> 33:53.864
the weather's really started
to pick up.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.265
We're kind of in a
white-out at this point.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.867
[wind blowing]

33:57.102 --> 33:59.903
<i> [zeke] if it's already started</i>
<i>  to blow, it's not going</i>
<i>  to get any better.</i>

33:59.905 --> 34:00.904
How does it look down there?

34:00.906 --> 34:02.072
<i>  It's scary.</i>

34:02.107 --> 34:06.276
[blizzard blowing]

34:09.081 --> 34:10.213
[car approaching]

34:12.618 --> 34:14.051
delicious.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.186
Did you
dip your finger in it?

34:18.023 --> 34:21.158
I know all those knuckleheads
out there, are trying
to outrun the storm,

34:21.160 --> 34:23.060
and trying to get gold.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.561
But I know better.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.729
I've been doing this
a long time.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.732
I'm going to wait
until it passes
to start.

34:28.734 --> 34:33.136
A day like today,
it's stormyng outside.
Not much else to do.

34:33.305 --> 34:35.172
Catch up on social media.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.177
<i> [narrator] and now,</i>
<i>  another social hour</i>
<i>  with vernon.</i>

34:41.013 --> 34:41.878
Crack. Snack.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.447
[vernon reading]

34:48.053 --> 34:50.620
well, you know there used to
be that character

34:50.622 --> 34:52.556
that kind of
ruins that name.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.825
I never did like
being called, "vern"
to start out with.

34:54.827 --> 34:58.295
But then there was that guy,
"earnest", or whatever
his name was.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.864
He used to always say,
"you know what I mean, vern?"

35:00.866 --> 35:05.435
I wanted to [bleep]
that [bleep] every time
he'd said it. Okay?

35:05.437 --> 35:08.605
So, I just don't like "vern",
you know, vern.

35:08.607 --> 35:12.042
Vernon. Let's enunciate it
and say the whole damn word.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.711
I'll take it like
I have a second more
to say it,

35:14.713 --> 35:18.949
[vernon reading]

35:18.951 --> 35:19.950
I don't know about that.

35:19.952 --> 35:20.817
I'm pretty sociable.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.320
Nobody [bleep] with me.

35:23.322 --> 35:27.424
[narrator]
<i>  this has been another</i>
<i>  social hour with vernon.</i>

35:27.426 --> 35:31.962
I can actually sit here and
have a drink, and get people
to listen to my [bleep].

35:31.964 --> 35:33.096
What could be better
than that?

35:33.098 --> 35:34.231
[laughing]

35:35.300 --> 35:37.300
[blizzard blowing]

35:46.378 --> 35:47.310
[motor running]

35:49.648 --> 35:51.648
visibility up top
just went down to nothing,

35:51.650 --> 35:55.819
in the last like, 20 minutes.

35:55.821 --> 35:59.856
I'm genuinely worried that
this blizzard will get
really severe really quickly.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.892
[motor running]

36:01.894 --> 36:06.429
sort of picking up,
it's exponentially worse
by every 10 mins.

he's dragging the [bleep]
out of the beach.

37:03.088 --> 37:06.823
You know what, at this point,
there's not any amount of gold
that would be wise

37:06.825 --> 37:08.358
to stick around for.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.727
Because this is just getting
too nasty. I mean,

37:10.729 --> 37:12.696
we're gonna lose
all of our [bleep]
if we stay out here.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.965
It's bad.
We gotta be moving.

37:14.967 --> 37:18.401
It's pretty nasty out.
I know town's that way.

37:19.204 --> 37:21.771
I wish I had a compass.

37:21.773 --> 37:25.875
We're already kinda [bleep]
because we can't see anything.
It's white out.

37:25.877 --> 37:29.212
We're going to do our best
to get as much stuff
off the ice as I can.

37:29.982 --> 37:31.815
I thought we were gonna have
a good time.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.050
This isn't supposed to come on
until later tonight.

37:34.052 --> 37:36.119
It's supposed
to be nice all day.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.388
[zeke] I know.
It's just a blizzard.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.990

37:46.999 --> 37:51.401
wind's going to pick up
to 70 by tomorrow morning.

37:51.436 --> 37:52.702
So...

37:52.771 --> 37:55.372
These things should be
lost in the ice.
They can go to russia.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.441
So I'm going to take
a load in to the beach.

37:59.011 --> 38:00.343
[straining]

38:00.746 --> 38:02.912
put it below our placement.

[steve] over here. It's caught
right here guys.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.216
Okay.

[steve grunting]

38:09.221 --> 38:12.122
<i> [zeke] we've definitely</i>

<i>  pulled to shore otherwise</i>
<i>  it's gonna get torn apart</i>

38:15.460 --> 38:16.960
<i>  by these high winds.</i>

38:16.962 --> 38:19.429
This is the madness
that comes along
with ice mining.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.031
[zeke] all right.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.899
[zeke] good to go.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.567
[motor revving]

38:24.569 --> 38:26.603
[zeke] I don't know. I think
my brain is just trying
to process all this blizzard.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.004
What if blizzards happen
like this, get over years.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.106
Don't think of too much.
Just go. We gotta go.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.075
Stormy!
We can't lose stormy.

38:32.077 --> 38:32.976

First clean up
of the season here.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.739
Lots of magnetite.

39:02.741 --> 39:05.408
There's definitely
something here.

39:05.410 --> 39:09.145
I mean, there's no way
there's that much
heavy material

39:09.147 --> 39:10.880
without a big pile of gold.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.382
Yeah, I know too.

39:12.384 --> 39:15.685
Hope to see it
turn into a pile, soon.

39:15.687 --> 39:20.256
I've had this feeling
all along. We're on the trail
of a huge pile of gold.

39:20.258 --> 39:23.226
<i>  But what I'm seeing right now</i>
<i>  makes me wanna double down.</i>

39:23.729 --> 39:26.196
I know
we're on the right track.

39:26.198 --> 39:29.199
[shawn] let's see
what the hell
we have here, joe.

39:30.235 --> 39:31.234
Look at this.

39:33.905 --> 39:34.404
four.

Five.

39:40.011 --> 39:40.944
Six.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.012
Seven.

39:43.115 --> 39:44.047
Eight.

39:45.150 --> 39:45.582
Ten.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.884
10.20

39:47.886 --> 39:51.187
damn,
that's not a bad start
to the season.

39:51.189 --> 39:52.622
Nice job, joe.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.990
[joe] yeah.

39:53.992 --> 39:57.594
<i> [narrator] 10.2 ounces.</i>
<i>  It's worth</i>
<i>  over 19,000 dollars.</i>

Even though mother nature
dealt some bad cards,

40:00.899 --> 40:04.167
shawn pomrenke still had
a winning hand.

40:04.169 --> 40:04.968
[shawn] yeah.

40:04.970 --> 40:05.802
We're doing great.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.804
I mean it's there.
We're catching it.

40:07.806 --> 40:12.041
And like, we could just keep
plugging away, we're going
to hit something big.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.677
That's just why I got
the feeling and it's there.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.545
Boom!

40:15.547 --> 40:17.914
That's how you start
ice-mining season.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.283
<i> [shawn] we had that huge storm</i>
<i>  breathing down our necks.</i>

40:20.285 --> 40:22.118
<i>  But we still got that gold.</i>

40:22.120 --> 40:25.155
We gave what we needed to do
but now we just gotta
keep it up.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.089
[shawn] not bad.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.223
Yeah, it's great.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.062
<i> [narrator] next time...</i>

40:33.064 --> 40:34.864
<i>  On bering sea gold.</i>

40:34.866 --> 40:35.565
It is cold.

40:35.567 --> 40:36.533
[drilling]

40:36.535 --> 40:38.835
just to keep the thing running
is the struggle.

40:38.837 --> 40:42.338
[shawn] but the harder it is
to get, the better
the gold's gonna be.

40:42.340 --> 40:43.006
[drilling]

40:43.008 --> 40:43.840
[vernon] right there.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.875
Underneath that.
Is cooper gold.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.978
So, fingers crossed,
knocking on wood...

40:48.980 --> 40:50.680
[zeke] we have to move
this entire snow there.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.848
Earning my money today.

40:51.850 --> 40:54.751
If I get
everything running today,
I'm gonna smash out,

a bunch of more hours.
Dig, stormy dig!

40:56.955 --> 40:59.856
[zeke] right now,
the plan is simple.
We'll dig this out.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.424
I'll pull my
sled to the water.

41:01.793 --> 41:02.959

to begin.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.063
[wind blowing]

41:07.065 --> 41:07.864
we gotta go.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.065
It's just gonna
get worse here.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.200
But we're going for it.

41:11.970 --> 41:12.936
Where?
