      What up,
      Big Brother X-Ray Vision?

09:46.604 --> 09:48.770
        I don't like none
        of these motherfuckers.

09:48.772 --> 09:51.672
 Hey, man, you know,
 I hear they've been
 trying to get some trim.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.741
           ALL: Oh, shit!

09:54.743 --> 09:58.945
 Julian, how long
 these sorry moonheads
 been on line, anyhow?

10:01.349 --> 10:03.082

 (GIRLS CHANTING OUTSIDE)
              do you hear this?

10:05.786 --> 10:08.153
              Six weeks on line

10:08.155 --> 10:13.157
          and you still do not
          meet the approval
          of your Big Brothers.

10:13.159 --> 10:16.960
  This deeply grieves my heart.

10:18.830 --> 10:22.264
        Now, when you began,
        there were 10 Gammites.

10:22.266 --> 10:23.999

      how many of you will
      cross the burning sands

10:31.941 --> 10:37.376
      to the oasis of
      Gamma Phi Gamma.
      But I do know

10:37.378 --> 10:39.644
 that there is no room

10:39.646 --> 10:42.713
 for any pretenders.

       No, it couldn't be Yoda.

 why you pledged.

 this sawed-off human being

 hasn't even
 had a girl yet.

 Oh, isn't that right?

 I gave it to you.

 your laundry done,
 I did it for you.

 I got you food and stuff
 for your Big Brothers.

 to have no females
 laying around the dorm.

 I wouldn't help you
 like that, man.

15:32.141 --> 15:33.974
 This man had a vision.

 And that vision
 was passed down
 to his son, Hayward.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.879
 Mission College
 was founded to educate

15:40.881 --> 15:42.347
 the sons and daughters

           and we'll continue
           to be grateful

15:50.889 --> 15:53.322
       for the support
       of the Snodgrass family.

 Hold it. I've got
 something else to say.

16:02.264 --> 16:04.197
 This is a new day.

16:04.199 --> 16:06.933
 There is a feeling
 that the predominantly
 black college,

16:06.935 --> 16:10.403
 for all intents and purposes,
 has outlived its usefulness.

16:10.405 --> 16:12.304
   Over the years,
   it has been vital

16:12.306 --> 16:14.172
  to our elevation
  in this great country,

16:14.174 --> 16:17.942
 but the need no longer exists
 in an integrated society.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.978
           That's absurd.
           It does exist.

16:22.081 --> 16:25.549
    It exists at Notre Dame

16:25.551 --> 16:29.352
        and Yeshiva, Brandeis,
        at Brigham Young.

16:29.354 --> 16:31.554
        Now you tell me,
        what is the difference?

16:31.556 --> 16:34.124
 You want to know
 the difference?
 I'll tell you the difference.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.993
 The difference is
 that the Catholics alone
 support the Notre Dames.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.594
 The Jews alone
 support the Yeshivas.

16:38.596 --> 16:40.529
   Mormons support
   the Brigham Youngs.

16:40.531 --> 16:43.331
 Who supports
 the black colleges?
 I'll tell you who.

16:43.333 --> 16:48.069
 The federal government
 and philanthropists
 like Snodgrass.

16:48.071 --> 16:52.406
 Harold,
 why won't blacks support
 Spelman, Tuskegee,

16:52.408 --> 16:54.141

16:54.143 --> 16:56.309
              We do.

16:56.311 --> 16:58.344
 Look,
 as Chairman of the Board,

16:58.346 --> 17:00.646
   I was sent here
   to talk with you.

17:00.648 --> 17:04.249
 Now, he does not like
 this divestment mess,
 and I don't like it, either.

17:04.251 --> 17:07.050
 Now, you better snip it
 right here at the bud,
 or I will.

17:07.053 --> 17:09.252
 'Cause if you don't,
 you stand a good chance
 of losing them.

17:09.255 --> 17:11.555
               There it is.

17:11.557 --> 17:14.290
 Yeah. People like them
 don't like to be told
 what to do with their money.

17:14.292 --> 17:16.592
    Old, old money.

17:19.762 --> 17:22.763
          Shit, I tell you all
          time after time,

17:22.766 --> 17:25.031
         do not sit here again.

17:25.034 --> 17:28.568
         Stay off my bed.
         Stay in your own room.

        I swear, man.

 Sorry about the bed, homeboy.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.673
 But check this out,
 we got a question
 for you, man.

17:34.675 --> 17:36.775
 What's up
 with your cousin Half-Pint?

17:36.777 --> 17:38.710
   Yo, man, why is he pledging?
                         Oops.

17:38.712 --> 17:42.447
         Yo, man, you wanna
         take your last breath?

17:42.449 --> 17:45.183
             I didn't think so.
             That's my cousin.

17:45.185 --> 17:47.451
           You leave him alone.
           You don't talk
           about him like that.

17:47.453 --> 17:48.819
      We understand each other?

17:48.821 --> 17:50.654
    I'm sorry, man.

17:50.656 --> 17:54.157
 But seriously, man,
 what's up with the Pint, man?

17:54.159 --> 17:56.058
             But seriously,
             who's going back

17:56.060 --> 17:58.126
 to the administration building
 with me tonight?

17:58.128 --> 18:00.328
   GRADY: Not the kid. Uh-uh.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.596
 Man, you crazy?
 We're going to the coronation.

18:02.598 --> 18:04.431
          More butts
          and more titties.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.633
           That's right,
           God damn it.

18:06.635 --> 18:08.501
  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
  I thought y'all was down
  for the cause.

18:08.503 --> 18:10.135
          Yeah, you my brother,
          but goddamn, man.

18:10.137 --> 18:11.669
        That's right,
        goddamn.

18:11.671 --> 18:13.771
    You should
    lighten up on that shit,
    Malcolm, seriously.

18:13.773 --> 18:15.105
        He's right, Nat Turner.

18:15.107 --> 18:16.573
           Marcus Garvey.

18:16.575 --> 18:18.474
 Frederick Douglass.

18:18.476 --> 18:20.742
      Yeah. You all can kiss
      my black ass twice, hear?

18:20.744 --> 18:22.710
      Preach, Jesse. Preach on.

18:22.712 --> 18:24.278
          Yo, Farrakhan, relax.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.446
         Don't be so sensitive,
         my man. Chill.

18:26.448 --> 18:29.382
  What about the parade?
  Somebody coming
  to the parade with me, maybe?

18:29.384 --> 18:30.850
            Hey, I'm down, man,
            but not tonight.

18:30.852 --> 18:33.252
       I gots to see some
       butts shaking, you know.

18:33.254 --> 18:35.287
      Word up. I'm with him.
      That ain't no joke, man.
      I can't...

18:35.289 --> 18:37.455
  What about the rest of y'all?

18:37.457 --> 18:38.722
              Tomorrow.

18:38.724 --> 18:40.690
              All right, bet.
              Enjoy yourselves.

18:40.692 --> 18:43.693
              I'll see you all
              tomorrow morning,
              9:00 a.m. sharp.

18:43.695 --> 18:46.595
 That's Kool and the Gang,
 brother.

18:46.597 --> 18:48.296
                     Later.

18:48.298 --> 18:50.197
    Jordan, this look familiar?

18:50.199 --> 18:51.631
        Looks like your mother.

18:51.633 --> 18:53.799
          Yo, yo, my ball, man.
 You don't need it.

18:55.836 --> 18:57.402
             Gamma.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.609
 Anybody call me? Perry.

19:10.247 --> 19:12.447
                 How you doing?
 How are you?

19:12.449 --> 19:13.681
              You recognize me?

19:13.683 --> 19:15.382
 Yeah, I've seen you on line.

19:15.384 --> 19:17.183
 Aren't you number one?

19:17.185 --> 19:18.551
               Yeah, that's me.
               Half-Pint,

19:18.553 --> 19:20.152
            Gammite number one.

19:20.154 --> 19:21.553
               Gamma Phi Gamma.

19:21.555 --> 19:23.354
      (CHUCKLING)
      Pleased to meet you.

19:23.356 --> 19:25.155
              Nice to meet you.

19:25.157 --> 19:26.823
     So it's almost
     that time, huh?

19:26.825 --> 19:28.624
    Yeah, it'll be any day now.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.425
     Are you excited?

19:30.427 --> 19:31.692
                     A little.

19:34.863 --> 19:38.164
     So, Half-Pint,
     what can I do for you?

19:38.166 --> 19:40.266
    Well, I was wondering maybe
    if we could see each other,

19:40.268 --> 19:41.834
             go out to a movie,
             a restaurant,

19:41.836 --> 19:44.303
             pop some Jiffy Pop
             popcorn together.

19:44.305 --> 19:47.306
    You know,
    enjoy each other's company.
          Yeah, sure.

19:47.308 --> 19:49.508
     That'd be nice.
     That sounds real good.

19:49.510 --> 19:52.444
   Why don't you come by
   after you go over.
   I'm usually in at night.

19:52.446 --> 19:54.813
           I was thinking soon.
           How soon?

19:54.815 --> 19:57.282
            Like now,
            at the Gamma House.
            Sorry.

19:57.284 --> 19:59.317
       I can't.
             We could have fun.
             Big fun.

19:59.319 --> 20:01.485
        Just give me one reason
        why not, just one.

20:01.487 --> 20:04.888
    First of all,
    I don't know you from Adam.

20:04.890 --> 20:08.191
  You just pop out of thin air,
  and I'm supposed to say yes?

20:08.193 --> 20:09.825
          I've always been
          attracted to you.

20:09.827 --> 20:12.527
         I just couldn't
         tell you before.
         I was shy.

20:12.529 --> 20:15.663
        But now that
        I've been pledging,
        I'm a different person.

20:15.665 --> 20:17.531
     Well, I'm not
     attracted to you.

20:17.533 --> 20:20.367
       Besides, I don't want
       a physical relationship.

20:20.369 --> 20:22.502
        All you guys are dogs.

20:22.504 --> 20:24.470
   I've heard about you Gammas.

20:24.472 --> 20:28.207
     I'm not trying to dog you.
     Look at my face.

20:28.209 --> 20:30.943
      Can't a real Gamma man
      be attracted to you, huh?

20:30.945 --> 20:33.745
   Is this some type of a joke?

20:33.747 --> 20:36.948
        Did your Big Brother
        send you over here?

20:36.950 --> 20:41.218
          I don't have time
          for children's games.

20:41.220 --> 20:44.221
 And you're so small,
 I'd probably break you in two.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.260
 WOMAN:
 See? See? See?
 I knew it. I knew it.

20:51.262 --> 20:52.928
    That's okay.

20:52.930 --> 20:54.663
                    DINA:
                    <i> Gamma Rays,</i>

20:54.665 --> 20:58.400
            I call to order
            the 35th meeting
            of the Sister Order

20:58.402 --> 21:01.536
      of Gamma Phi Gamma
      Fraternity, Incorporated.

21:01.538 --> 21:02.870
                   Meow.

21:02.872 --> 21:04.471
       GAMMA RAYS: Meow.

21:04.473 --> 21:05.905
               Kim, could you
               read the minutes

21:05.907 --> 21:07.473
         from the last meeting,
         please?

21:07.475 --> 21:09.274
 All right.
 We decided that Velda

21:09.276 --> 21:11.476
 will take care of the music
 for the fashion show.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.846
 Velda, please, none of that
 hip-hop, B-boys nonsense.

21:14.848 --> 21:15.980
  GAMMA RAYS: Yeah.

21:15.982 --> 21:18.315
    I happen to like Run-DMC.

21:18.317 --> 21:20.650
 Nevertheless,
 leave it at home.

21:20.652 --> 21:22.985
 Miriam,
 did you call the boutiques?

21:22.987 --> 21:24.753
                    Yes, I did.

21:24.755 --> 21:26.855
 Did you make
 a list of the suppliers?
                    Yes, I did.

21:26.857 --> 21:28.423
 She is such
 a pain in the ass.

21:28.425 --> 21:29.824
          Look. Let's not
          make this long, okay?

21:29.826 --> 21:31.292
        We have to get dressed.

21:31.294 --> 21:32.726
      Now what have we decided?

21:32.728 --> 21:34.728
 Okay. I talked to the Brothers

21:34.730 --> 21:36.663
      and the Gammites
      are definitely going over
      tomorrow night.

21:36.665 --> 21:37.830
 GAMMA RAYS: All right.

21:37.832 --> 21:39.531
             So we should
             give them a party.

21:39.533 --> 21:41.466
        ALL: Yes.

21:41.468 --> 21:44.669
 They haven't
 had fun for so long,
 a jam will be on.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.237
      Where, at the frat house?

21:46.239 --> 21:47.504
 Yeah, at the Gamma House.

21:47.506 --> 21:48.838
 The brothers
 said it was cool,

21:48.840 --> 21:50.272
 but we have to
 clean up first.

21:50.274 --> 21:51.473
              MIRIAM: Clean up?

21:51.475 --> 21:52.640
                 Are you crazy?

21:52.642 --> 21:53.974
       Look,
       we have been cleaning up

21:53.976 --> 21:56.710
             after those sorry,
             tired, trifling,

21:56.712 --> 21:58.745
            shiftless Negroes
            from day one.

21:58.747 --> 22:01.681
      And I am not cleaning up.
      I refuse to clean.

22:01.683 --> 22:04.250
            Miriam, why are you
            always complaining?

22:04.252 --> 22:05.884
           This is for G-Phi-G.

22:05.886 --> 22:07.385
 For the black and silver.

22:07.387 --> 22:08.986
                 Yet and still,
                 I am no maid.

22:08.988 --> 22:10.921
  And we are?
 TASHA:
 Well, I have a question.

22:10.923 --> 22:12.522
 Who's gonna pay
 for it this time?

22:12.524 --> 22:14.524
          We're giving it,
          we should pay for it.

22:14.526 --> 22:16.526
          GAMMA RAY:
          We always pay for it.
 Common sense.

22:16.528 --> 22:18.394
       We are gonna pay for it.

22:18.396 --> 22:20.929
           Now, Dina,
           how much did we make
           from the bake sale?

22:22.465 --> 22:23.864
      Enough.

22:23.866 --> 22:25.799
                  I'm not going
                  to the party.

         Here's to
         the Liberty Bowl, man.

22:49.954 --> 22:51.420
   Couldn't get one.

                      Oh, shit!

22:53.724 --> 22:55.824
      You've been jamming us up
      since we started, man.
      If I don't go over...

22:55.826 --> 22:56.925
                 I'm coming up.

22:56.927 --> 22:58.426
 Asked four women.

22:58.428 --> 23:00.528
        What's wrong with five?
                  Come on, man.

23:00.530 --> 23:03.497
       Yo, yo, yo.
       Hold up, hold up.
       Listen, Half-Pint.

23:03.499 --> 23:06.333
    You got to go back out
    and bring in a freak.

23:06.335 --> 23:08.335
                    Two freaks.
                Yeah.

23:08.337 --> 23:11.004
 Here's $5.
 All this is is a test.

23:11.006 --> 23:13.373
 And you're going to pass
 with flying colors.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.708
 I want you to take
 that $5 US currency

23:15.710 --> 23:17.676
 and go to the pet shop,
 get yourself a kitten.

23:17.678 --> 23:19.844
 Put it in a cage
 and mark it "Pussy."

23:19.846 --> 23:23.714
 Give it to Dean
 Big Brother Almighty
 and say, "Pass the pussy."

    It ain't even real.

24:09.886 --> 24:11.819
               You wish you had

       you weren't even born
       with blue eyes.

 That's right.
 Blue contact lenses.

 She's tired, man.
 She put the "T" in tired.

35:05.585 --> 35:08.185

 somebody would have to do

35:13.325 --> 35:16.459

        Don't start, all right?

41:23.664 --> 41:25.830
 What are you talking about,
 "Don't start"?

41:25.832 --> 41:27.898
   I know I have
   my problems with them,
   but with you it's a crusade.

         I'm beginning to think
         you're color-struck.

41:29.768 --> 41:33.503
  You definitely have a thing

           Yes, you.

41:35.907 --> 41:38.908
 No, no, Rachel.
 It's them. It's not me.

         I'm gonna do it.

 then it was Darrell, now you.

46:17.208 --> 46:19.041

 no sorority.

               sick in the head

46:29.918 --> 46:31.284
         to think
         I'd have your support.

46:31.286 --> 46:33.519
 Yeah, you must have been
 sick in the head,

46:33.521 --> 46:36.755
 'cause you ain't
 getting my support
 on nothing like that. No way.

46:36.757 --> 46:38.156
            Thought I would.

46:38.158 --> 46:40.458
  Yeah, well...

46:40.460 --> 46:44.061
 You know them
 sororities are just as bad
 as fraternities, Rachel.

46:44.063 --> 46:47.164
      Vaughn, this is something
      that I want to do.

46:47.166 --> 46:49.332
         You have every right
         not to like the Greeks

46:49.334 --> 46:51.367

 Now that's bullshit.

               on campus and

46:54.772 --> 46:56.805
 That's bullshit, Rachel!

46:56.807 --> 46:58.373

46:59.542 --> 47:01.208

 McPHERSON: Vaughn Dunlap.

58:22.175 --> 58:25.109
   Yeah, President McPherson.

58:25.111 --> 58:27.211
  How'd you get the name
  "Dap"?

58:27.213 --> 58:29.580
  Just a nickname. That's all.

58:29.582 --> 58:34.717
 Anyway, Vaughn,
 you've been a good student
 these past four years

58:34.719 --> 58:37.886
 and you've grown
 into a fine young man.

58:37.888 --> 58:40.121
        Thank you, sir.

58:40.123 --> 58:43.991
 That's why I'm so surprised
 at your recent activities.

58:43.993 --> 58:45.859
          Activities?

58:45.861 --> 58:48.194
 You've become
 a disruptive force
 on this campus.

58:48.196 --> 58:51.997
 You're hindering other folks
 from an education.

58:51.999 --> 58:54.165
          Let me make it plain.

58:56.469 --> 58:59.770
          Hey, man, you don't
          really have a choice.

58:59.772 --> 59:03.140
  If you continue these antics,
  you'll be expelled.

59:03.142 --> 59:06.109
              Plain and simple,
              short and sweet.

59:06.111 --> 59:09.212
 This is Cedar Cloud,
 Chairman of
 the Board of Trustees.

59:09.214 --> 59:11.214
 What he says is true.

59:11.216 --> 59:13.482
               True?

59:13.484 --> 59:15.550
       With all due respect,
       President McPherson,

59:15.552 --> 59:18.219
       I don't believe
       this man knows
       the meaning of the word.

59:18.221 --> 59:22.122
      So what?
      You marched with King
      in the '60s. Big deal.

59:22.124 --> 59:25.024
That was over 20 years ago.

59:25.026 --> 59:28.494
 Black people are
 still catching hell
 all over the world, you know.

59:28.496 --> 59:29.962

59:29.964 --> 59:32.130
 We have made progress.

59:32.132 --> 59:35.266
              Says who?

59:35.268 --> 59:39.703
      There is no way
      you can defend
      not divesting completely.

59:39.705 --> 59:41.838
          No ifs, ands
          or buts about it.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.940
              It's your program
              we don't like.

59:43.942 --> 59:48.277
 You cannot
 hinder other students
 from getting an education.

59:48.279 --> 59:49.645
     I'll do what I have to do.

59:50.881 --> 59:52.247
                     So will I.

59:54.017 --> 59:55.883
        You know... Look at me!

59:57.286 --> 01:00:00.687
               You've got a lot
               of living to do.

01:00:00.689 --> 01:00:04.057
               I had classmates
               here at Mission
               just like you.

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:06.893
        And now
        they're old and bitter.

01:00:09.597 --> 01:00:11.830
    You still don't understand,
    do you?

01:00:11.832 --> 01:00:13.198
    Make us understand.

01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:20.637
        Is there anything else?

01:00:20.639 --> 01:00:22.205
 McPHERSON: You may go.

01:00:22.207 --> 01:00:23.606
              Thank you.

01:00:24.675 --> 01:00:26.775
         We'll be watching you.

01:00:26.777 --> 01:00:28.076
    You do that.

01:00:45.928 --> 01:00:49.229
 Sorry about the game, man.
Hey, that's all right, man.

01:00:49.231 --> 01:00:51.164
 We gave it the old
 Mission College try, right?

01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:52.765
         No, we didn't.

01:00:52.767 --> 01:00:54.032
 So I lied.

01:01:00.305 --> 01:01:02.104
      What, 52-7?

01:01:02.106 --> 01:01:03.839
         I don't know, man.

01:01:03.841 --> 01:01:06.574
    I was looking at the honeys
    in the fourth quarter, man.

01:01:09.345 --> 01:01:10.844

01:01:10.846 --> 01:01:12.111

 It does not to me,
 Witherspoon.

 RACHEL:
 Well, the president
 handed in her resignation.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.993
 I told him about me pledging
 and he went off on me.

01:01:30.995 --> 01:01:33.261
 Did I hear right, Rachel?
 Yeah.

01:01:33.263 --> 01:01:36.030
 Did I just hear that
 you're going to pledge?

01:01:36.032 --> 01:01:38.132
 Thanks for telling us.
 It's a big surprise.

01:01:38.134 --> 01:01:40.934
 It shouldn't be a surprise.
 I've always wanted to pledge.

01:01:40.936 --> 01:01:42.135
                    DORIS:
                    Since when?

01:01:42.137 --> 01:01:43.369
 Since I got here.

01:01:43.371 --> 01:01:45.637
Oh, since you got here.
That's great.

01:01:45.639 --> 01:01:47.739
So now you feel you have
to belong to something.

01:01:47.741 --> 01:01:50.007
 You have to go up
 and join up
 with some people, huh?

                The Gamma Rays
                have certainly
                gotten to you.

01:01:52.177 --> 01:01:54.143
 Come on, y'all.
 I have a sense of who I am.

01:01:54.145 --> 01:01:56.278
         Then why wait
         till your senior year?

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.912
                          Yeah.

01:01:57.914 --> 01:02:00.147
 I was afraid of what
 Dap would think of me.

 in on the carpet.

01:02:21.899 --> 01:02:24.132
        You see?
        I knew it. I knew it.

01:02:24.134 --> 01:02:26.334
           Uh-huh. What else?
           I know there's more.
           What else?

          about kicking me

         And we all agree
         that Mission
         has to divest, right?

        something big.

   I don't know what it is yet.

01:02:55.757 --> 01:03:00.426

   to let McPherson,

     and the world know
     that we won't have no part

       and getting
       a Brooks Brothers suit.

        You know I love you
        like my brother, man,

     but, I mean,
     what is wrong with wanting
     to have a nice job?

01:03:27.283 --> 01:03:29.383
              I don't think
              anything's wrong.

     my mama, they slaved
     all their damn life

      to school.

 I'll be the first one
 in my family to go to college.

01:03:41.127 --> 01:03:43.427
       I mean, Dap, man,
       do you realize
       what that means?

01:03:43.429 --> 01:03:47.464
  I mean, the first one ever.

01:03:47.466 --> 01:03:50.934
   And all my family
   has always been
   sharecroppers since slavery.

    what you want to do, Dap.

 not even Jesus Christ himself.

 Don't leave me hanging.

01:04:09.351 --> 01:04:11.818

               lighten up, man.
               Seriously.

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.487

 to be quiet, man,
 to shut the fuck up.

       it's going to be, huh?

       it is right now, bro.
