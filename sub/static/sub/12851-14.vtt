♪♪

00:09.143 --> 00:11.343
Look at all
of these new people.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.978
-No.
-Why "no"?

00:12.979 --> 00:14.612
Because you're getting
all interested in everybody,
aren't you?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.715
-What's wrong with getting
interested in people?
-No.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.952
-Why "no"?
-Because you're only supposed
to be pretend interested

00:19.954 --> 00:21.520
in however many people
we already know.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.555
You're only pretend interested
in people?

00:23.557 --> 00:26.458
Yeah. Everyone's more
comfortable that way. Watch.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.430
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you!

00:33.334 --> 00:34.867
Now watch this.
How are you?

00:34.869 --> 00:35.901
How are you?

00:35.903 --> 00:37.236
No, I really mean it.
How are you?

00:37.238 --> 00:38.871
-Back off.
-Yeah, get out of my life.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.742
I look out at the sea
of new students and would like

00:43.744 --> 00:46.211
to explore the potential
of new friendships for us.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.346
What would you like?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.314
I would like everyone
to mind their own business.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.217
Don't you think that
somewhere around here

00:52.219 --> 00:53.986
could be a wonderful
new friend for us?

00:53.988 --> 00:55.220
I would have to learn names!

00:55.222 --> 00:57.890
I'm still learning "Zay."

00:57.892 --> 01:00.759
It's Zay, right?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.728
We are going to make
one new friend.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.363
If we make one new
friend every day

01:04.365 --> 01:06.432
for the rest of the year,
you know what we'll have?

01:06.434 --> 01:09.401
Lice. We'll have lice.
I guarantee you.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.869
It's great to
have you back, Maya.

01:10.871 --> 01:14.039
Thanks. My hair is way too long
to make new friends.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.041
So who's it gonna be?

01:16.043 --> 01:18.544
Who's the lucky person
who's going to get blessed

01:18.546 --> 01:20.245
with our special kind
of friendship?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.447
I wouldn't force
that on anybody.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.781
Watch me.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.451
Hi! Good morning!

01:25.453 --> 01:27.386
My name is Riley Matthews

01:27.388 --> 01:29.688
-and this is
my friend Maya Hart.
-Sup?

01:30.758 --> 01:33.759
I wanted to introduce myself
to extend the warmest

01:33.761 --> 01:35.761
of invitations
to be our new friend.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.364
I really like
what you're wearing.

01:39.366 --> 01:42.468
Great hair,
nice eyes, good knees.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.771
Be my friend?

01:46.707 --> 01:47.739
Watch this, Maya.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.374
This is how
new friendships are born.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.343
I don't like her at all.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.913
She-- she don't like me.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.648
Watch whatever happens next.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.423
Hi, Maya.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.425
Who's this?
A new friend of yours?

02:06.427 --> 02:08.427
Well, any new friend of Maya
is a great friend of mine.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.495
Hi.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.396
Wow.

02:24.011 --> 02:27.412

for the rest of their lives.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.519
We're out in the world now.
You're gonna have to face
little setbacks.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.588
-You can't have
everyone like you.
-Why not?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.389
Because you can't
control the world

03:44.391 --> 03:46.558
and you can't control
other people in the world.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.561
The only thing you can control
is your own reaction
to what goes on.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.863

04:15.289 --> 04:17.789
Maya, I had the worst dream!

04:17.791 --> 04:19.558

-Don't dream about me.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.565
How's it goin'?

04:26.567 --> 04:28.066
Someone doesn't like Riley,

04:28.068 --> 04:30.068
my legs are asleep,
we have Health class.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.470
Okay. Come on.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.604
No.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.186
(thud)

05:10.911 --> 05:12.244
Maybe you're right.

05:12.246 --> 05:14.579
Maybe I can't control
who likes me or not,

05:14.581 --> 05:16.615
but there's more to life,
like Health class.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.984
I am so excited
for today's Health class.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.756
"Our bodies,
our friends." Yikes.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.693
Oh, I'm sure that the teacher's
sensitive take on life

05:27.695 --> 05:30.195
will be a lovely way to learn
how our bodies work.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.600
What's that?

05:35.602 --> 05:37.969
All right, all you creepy
little child-adults,

05:37.971 --> 05:40.505
settle down.
Let's get this over with, huh?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.009
Ugh. Put your hand
down, Sunshine.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.777
You'll all pass
no matter what.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.978
You know why?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.381
'Cause if I fail ya,
I gotta meet your parents.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.116
I don't want
to meet your parents.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.786
I don't want to meet you.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.621
All right.
(snorts)

05:56.623 --> 05:58.090
Let's talk about your bodies.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.694
-(thud)
-Yeah, I don't blame him.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.664
Are you sure that
you're the right person
to teach us this?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.466
Why don't you
give me a chance?

06:07.468 --> 06:08.533
I may surprise ya.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.035
I want this to
be taught to me

06:10.037 --> 06:12.237
in a delicate
and sensitive manner.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.506
Yeah? Well, surprise.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.575
You can't control
this either, Riles.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.410
Welcome back, beloved.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.213
All right, everybody open
your Health textbooks
to page 73.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.952
(thud)

06:28.222 --> 06:30.756
He is the only one here
that knows what he's doing.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.731
And that's what
they taught us

06:39.733 --> 06:41.633
in Health class
about our bodies.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.538
You okay, Bubba?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.006
I'm telling everybody.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.441
You're not tellin' anybody.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.909
Concentrate on somethin' else.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.144
I can't.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.846
He's a gym teacher.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.349
Why would they have
a gym teacher teach us
about our bodies?

06:57.351 --> 06:59.084
This is another thing
you can't control.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.586
Could you please
tell Riley that there's
nobody in this world

07:01.588 --> 07:03.054
-who can control everything?
-(door unlocking)

07:03.056 --> 07:04.489
That ought to do it.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.759
Hi. It's me.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.227
Oh, good!

07:09.229 --> 07:11.563
Your daughter wants to control
what happens to her in life,

07:11.565 --> 07:13.598
and she needs someone
to tell her she can't,

07:13.600 --> 07:15.801
and you are the worst person
in the world for the job.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.103
Out of all the houses
in the world she could have
walked into,

07:18.105 --> 07:19.704
-she walks into ours.
-(chuckles)

07:19.706 --> 07:21.807
Well, I did used to be
a little bit of a control freak.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.375
(laughs)

07:24.812 --> 07:26.111
"Used to be"?
(laughs)

07:28.882 --> 07:30.749
I just thought
of something funny

07:30.751 --> 07:32.317
I just heard right now...

07:32.319 --> 07:34.719
from me.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.621
In school,
I'm supposed to write

07:36.623 --> 07:38.290
a big report about
what life means to me.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.758
Oh, great.
I'll help you.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.094
-Why?
-Because I can't control
who likes me or who teaches me

07:43.096 --> 07:46.465
or my own life,
but I can sure control yours.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.835
You know what's the best
about being the youngest?
Nothin'.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.003
Riley, you can't worry
about what people think

07:52.005 --> 07:54.005
because you can't control
what people think.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.308
The truth is,
when you try to control life,

07:56.310 --> 07:57.742
life does its best
to teach you not to.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.578
There's a girl
who doesn't like me.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.646
What's that you say now?

08:02.916 --> 08:05.684
Okay, honey.
You just keep being you,

08:05.686 --> 08:07.452
and she's gonna come around.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.787
So, we don't try
to control it?

08:08.789 --> 08:09.988
-No.
-We just let it be?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.122
-Yes.
-How?

08:11.124 --> 08:14.192
Well, see, what's gonna
happen all on its own

08:14.194 --> 08:16.328
is that Daddy's gonna
get me her phone number, see?

08:16.330 --> 08:18.296
And then perhaps,
I don't know, maybe I have

08:18.298 --> 08:20.131
a little howdy do
with her mommy.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.601
And if you don't have
a new friend by 9:00 tomorrow,

08:22.603 --> 08:24.836
as natural as flowers
in the springtime,

08:24.838 --> 08:27.806
well, then maybe Leonard,
the income tax attorney
in Mommy's office,

08:27.808 --> 08:31.209
he's gonna do just
a little bit of research
into their family's paperwork

08:31.211 --> 08:33.845
and see if there are
any inconsistencies.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.785
♪ Lee, lie, loo ♪

08:40.787 --> 08:43.221
-♪ Lee, lie, loo ♪
-That's so soothing.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.289
(softly)
Yes, it is.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.891
I'm gonna put
Momma to bed now.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.958
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.793
-I can do what I want.
-Yes, you can.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.896
-I'm the boss of this world.
-Yes, you are.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.835
Huh.
Riley, listen.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.803
I'm sure Mr. Fanucci knows
what he's doing.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.906
I need you to tell him
to treat our Health class

09:00.908 --> 09:02.507
with dignity
and sensitivity.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.809
Okay, but it's been
my experience that

09:04.811 --> 09:06.077
when you try
to control things,

09:06.079 --> 09:07.479
they only turn out worse.

09:07.481 --> 09:08.713
Promise me
you'll tell him that.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.849
Okay. I promise you
I'll talk to him.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.251
What could be worse
than learning about my body

09:13.253 --> 09:14.819
from the boy's gym teacher?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.454
Nothin'.

09:30.504 --> 09:33.171
Ya happy?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.207
Do it.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.012
Shh, shh.
♪ La, la, la ♪

09:48.422 --> 09:51.623
So I said, "Hey, Fanucci,
don't take this the wrong way."
He did.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.758
"Can you be
a little more sensitive

09:53.760 --> 09:54.926
in Health class?"
He can't.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.895
So, here I stand
in front of you

09:56.897 --> 10:00.332
begging you to make
this easy on me.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.571
Put that hand down forever.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.040
You have to answer
my question about the body.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.542
Uh--

10:10.544 --> 10:13.311
Maya, it's my father!
He doesn't know anything.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.913
I know things.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.314
What is the body?

10:16.316 --> 10:17.816
What does the body want?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.050
I'm gonna tell ya.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.820
Soup.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.154
Now you know everything.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.289
Goodnight!

10:25.592 --> 10:26.725
What do you want?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.460
-Smackle time, please.
-Absolutely.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.961
Hey, I thought
it was "Farkle time."

10:29.963 --> 10:31.480
It is Farkle time.

10:31.481 --> 10:32.998
It's always been Farkle time.
It'll always be Farkle time.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.432
Farkle time is
a worldwide phenomenon,

10:34.434 --> 10:35.800
a division
of Farkle Enterprises

10:35.802 --> 10:37.369
and the incontrovertible
essence of my soul.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.806
It's Smackle time
from now on.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.777
Mr. Matthews is
our teacher and our friend

10:45.779 --> 10:48.246
who always encourages us
to pursue the subject matter.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.015
Not this time, baby.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.017
We will begin.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.485
On page 73
of your Health books,

10:53.487 --> 10:56.888
what they're trying
to teach you is (bleep).

11:05.032 --> 11:08.933
(bleep)

11:13.473 --> 11:14.806
You're not going to believe

11:14.808 --> 11:16.775
what that man
of yours did today.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.710
Oh, sure I will,

11:18.712 --> 11:20.311
but Auggie wants to
tell Riley something first.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.180
Oh, yay!
Your homework.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.683
The one thing I was able
to completely control.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.653
How could you fail
what life means to me?

11:28.655 --> 11:30.121
Yeah.

11:30.123 --> 11:33.024
Perhaps Mrs. Pigsniffle asked me
if I did the work myself.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.893
"Mrs. Pigsniffle"?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.630
Yeah. You're the first
to notice it.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.534
She could tell
I helped you with it, huh?

11:42.536 --> 11:45.236
She told me
that this was clearly
the work of a fifth grader.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.538
(stifled laugh)

11:46.540 --> 11:48.306
Ugh.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.841
She don't like me,

11:49.843 --> 11:51.676
my father teaches soup,
and I can't even

11:51.678 --> 11:53.378
help my own brother
with his homework.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.979
You want to break it to her
or should I?

11:54.981 --> 11:57.048
Riley, as much as I've tried,

11:57.050 --> 11:59.417
it's impossible to control
what goes on all the time.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.019
I know how hard
that was for you.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.921
It's killing me.
I'm smiling, right?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.924
Auggie, your teacher
wants you to write

12:05.926 --> 12:08.727
what life means to you,
not what it means
to somebody else.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.895
Then I will.
Thanks anyway, Riley.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.131
You're welcome, Auggie.
Good luck with everything.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.267
I give up.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.070
Riley, as much as I try,

12:19.072 --> 12:21.439
it's impossible to control
what goes on all the time.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.743
Sometimes it's okay to
just be a leaf in the wind
and see where we land.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.911
Even when we don't like
what's happening to us?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.847
Especially then.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.116
Because that's when I found out
life was usually trying
to teach me something.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.685
Well, what could this
be trying to teach me?

12:33.687 --> 12:35.587
It teaches you who you are.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.022
Because as much as we think
we show everybody who we are

12:38.024 --> 12:39.958
when we're completely
in charge of what happens,

12:39.960 --> 12:42.260
we find out who we really are
when we're not.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.963
Thanks for being my mom.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.364
You're welcome.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.032
That's who I am.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.445
Lucas, what would you do

13:00.447 --> 13:02.280
if there was
somebody in your life
who didn't like you?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.082
I'd go like this.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.352
That would work for you?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.456
(giggles)

13:11.458 --> 13:12.791
-Smackle!
-Do it.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.160
(giggles jaggedly)

13:16.596 --> 13:18.429
Thanks, honey.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.131
-Zay?
-Riley?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.467
What would you do
if there was somebody in
your life who didn't like you?

13:22.469 --> 13:23.935
Oof. I'd move to New York.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.470
(all laugh dryly)

13:25.472 --> 13:27.472
(laughs dryly)

13:27.474 --> 13:29.240
Maya, what would you do?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.675
I just don't care as much.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.177
Well, you cared
when you used to be me.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.946
Yeah, and it was exhausting,
but I'm better now, Riles.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.915
You want to feel better?
Don't care so much.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.149
I don't know
how to do that.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.818
I care that people like me.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.852
Do people like me?

13:40.854 --> 13:42.787
-Of course they like you.
-They do?

13:42.789 --> 13:44.389
-You like me, Lucas?
-Sure.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.225
He's sitting right next to me!

13:48.962 --> 13:50.695
Riley, there's not
a person in this world

13:50.697 --> 13:52.330
that wouldn't like you
once they got to know you.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.132
Oh, well, that's
very nice of you, Lucas,

13:54.134 --> 13:56.267
but the more me I was,
the faster she ran away.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.435
Come on.
Who cares about her?

13:57.437 --> 13:58.870
Let's think about
something else.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.806
Yeah, maybe if we move on
and think about something else,

14:01.808 --> 14:03.308
then we could get on
with our lives...

14:03.310 --> 14:05.443
she said,
knowing that was crazy.

14:06.980 --> 14:11.649
Hey, guys, did you know
that astronomers calculate

14:11.651 --> 14:15.620
that there are
one billion trillion stars
in the observable universe?

14:15.622 --> 14:18.189
One billion trillion?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.624
Well, that's just amazing.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.192
I thought it was less.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.561
Zay:
I know!

14:23.562 --> 14:24.995
It gives you so much
to think about...

14:24.998 --> 14:28.132
Other than whatever's going on
in our little lives.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.002
A billion trillion stars?

14:31.004 --> 14:33.504
You could give them all
Riley names is what
you could do.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.572
I'll get you started.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.876
Twinkly, Sparkly, Twinkly.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.178
There's three.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.081
It certainly shows
how vast the universe is
and how small we are.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.515
Hey, you're right.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.151
We're all just specks.
That's all we are.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.421
And that other speck
doesn't like me!

14:58.365 --> 15:00.064
Did you finish
your paper, Auggie?

15:00.066 --> 15:03.601
Yeah. I still don't really know
what Mrs. Pigsniffle wanted,

15:03.603 --> 15:05.436
so I just tried
to answer the question.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.272
Can we hear it?

15:07.274 --> 15:11.175
<i>What Life Means to Me</i>
by Auggie D. Matthews.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.344
Your middle name
isn't "Doggie."

15:14.614 --> 15:18.516
"I've been here seven years
and I think life is a good idea.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.386
"I love my mom and dad,
my sister Riley,

15:21.388 --> 15:23.554
"my wife Ava,

15:23.556 --> 15:25.523
"my apartment
where I live in America

15:25.525 --> 15:28.126
and everything that happens
to me every day."

15:28.128 --> 15:30.194
Nice job, Auggie.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.697
So nice when you're young
and still in control
of everything.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.565
I'm not in control
of anything.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.301
That's what makes
life so easy for me.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.902
What?

15:37.904 --> 15:40.405
Yeah. When you think about it,
nothing's really my fault yet

15:40.407 --> 15:42.040
'cause I'm still cute.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.109
It's the first thing
I check every day.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.046
How did you get
such a good attitude?

15:48.048 --> 15:51.149
Because every day when I say,
"Good morning, Mrs. Pigsniffle,"

15:51.151 --> 15:53.051
I realize how lucky I am.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.722
So when do you start wanting
to be in control of things

15:57.724 --> 15:59.824
and when do you lose it?

15:59.826 --> 16:02.327
I remember I started getting
real confused about things

16:02.329 --> 16:03.761
when I was 11 or 12.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.096
When does it end?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.197
No.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.233
So, you know nothing
when you're a baby,

16:09.235 --> 16:11.102
when you're nine,
you're just figuring things out,

16:11.104 --> 16:12.603
and when you're 12,
you get confused forever?

16:12.605 --> 16:14.138
-That's life?
-Yep.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.742
10 and 11.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.111
<i>The Good Years</i>
by Cory Matthews.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.246
Mornin', crunch bars.
What up?

16:22.248 --> 16:24.282
Auggie was just
reading us his paper

16:24.284 --> 16:25.984
about life
and everybody he loves.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.752
-Am I in it?
-Yes.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.253
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.588
You didn't put me in it.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.690
I'm never even
gonna see 10 or 11!

16:32.692 --> 16:34.325
No, you won't!

16:42.869 --> 16:44.769
My good years are behind me,

16:44.771 --> 16:46.270
I have 80 star names to go,

16:46.272 --> 16:48.873
and I go to a high school
where somebody doesn't like me.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.108
Look on the bright side.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.378
Bright Side! 79 to go.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.346
And now, this.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.282
One of the most intricate parts

16:58.284 --> 17:00.985
of the human body is...

17:00.987 --> 17:02.120
No!

17:03.390 --> 17:05.390
I want to talk
to you guys today

17:05.392 --> 17:07.892
about the human foot.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.028
Uh-huh.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.295
Ha.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.875
Questions?

17:23.877 --> 17:27.812
See, what we have here is
a man with nothing to say.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.447
Sad.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.384
-Give up, Matthews?
-Okay.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.754
It's not so easy to explain
the wonders of the human body

17:36.756 --> 17:37.889
to the freshman class, huh?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.223
Or anyone.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.993
So did he teach it
to you in the delicate

17:41.995 --> 17:43.928
and sensitive manner
you requested, Sunshine?

17:43.930 --> 17:46.264
Not quite, but it's
out of my control.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.432
Everything is.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.700
Mm. (blows raspberry)
Wrongo!

17:49.702 --> 17:51.436
Wrongo?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.237
I've been doing this 20 years.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.540
It is never graceful.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.841
But it's always important.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.744
'Cause after you get past
all your laughter

17:59.746 --> 18:03.081
and your embarrassment,
we all arrive at one thing:

18:03.083 --> 18:07.618
you get this one mind
and you get this one body.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.456
That's what's completely
yours to control.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.791
How you take care of it,
how you treat it,

18:13.793 --> 18:17.261
how you nourish it,
what becomes of it.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.529
It's completely up to you.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.499
Especially when it seems
like nothing else is.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.002
Boy, do you have
the right teacher here.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.740
Does life know
what it's doing or huh?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.910
Uh, you know what else
there is about the human foots?

18:32.912 --> 18:34.112
They do...

18:39.385 --> 18:41.486
Yeah, they all do that.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.422
All right, here is
the thing about Health.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.990
This is what makes you healthy:

18:45.992 --> 18:49.127
whenever it seems
like everything else
is just out of control,

18:49.129 --> 18:51.496
you need to be able to
rely on your own minds

18:51.498 --> 18:52.797
and your own bodies

18:52.799 --> 18:55.800
to be whoever you are.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.401
'Cause knowing who you are,

18:57.403 --> 19:00.304
that's the best control
you could possibly have.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.341
So, make good decisions
about yourselves.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.612
That's the best thing
I can teach you.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.447
He's pretty good, Riley.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.415
Yeah.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.351
Maybe I should just control me.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.819
Maybe that's okay.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.355
What about
"Our bodies, our friends"?

19:17.357 --> 19:18.923
What about page 73?

19:20.660 --> 19:21.993
(thud)

19:21.995 --> 19:23.794
Oh, yeah.

19:23.796 --> 19:28.533
Listen, someday,
way down the line, please,

19:28.535 --> 19:30.768
if you make
more of yourselves...

19:32.172 --> 19:34.205
teach them the same thing.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.540
They'll thank you for it.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.941
Thank you.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.445
Anytime, Sunshine.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.290
Why did you make us
set our alarms for so early?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.457
I had such a good dream.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.193
You know what
I was dreaming of?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.196
How you doin'?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.399
We're holding balloons, Riley.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.900
Why are we holding balloons?

20:02.902 --> 20:05.536
I know that sometimes
I can be a handful...

20:05.538 --> 20:07.538
-All: No...
-Yes, yes, you are.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.875
but I learned something
and I want to share it
with you guys.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.543
This is our
letting go ceremony.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.178
We will let go
of all of the things

20:14.180 --> 20:16.180
that we think we can control
but we really don't.

20:16.182 --> 20:17.848
Well, I'm not doin' it.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.350
You don't control that.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.519
Except each other.
We will never let go
of each other.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.887
See?

20:25.191 --> 20:27.458
Okay, everybody.
Let go of your balloons.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.364
What happens now?

20:33.366 --> 20:36.434
Well, whatever life does to us,

20:36.436 --> 20:38.903
maybe we can't control it,

20:38.905 --> 20:41.272
but we can be
who we are and...

20:41.274 --> 20:44.175
control how we react to it.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.392
Hi.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.426
(sighs)

21:02.428 --> 21:05.529
Yeah, I still don't like you.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.531
Well, I like you.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.719
Woman:
<i>♪ Here comes Mr. Googly ♪</i>

21:28.721 --> 21:31.122
<i>♪ And his googly,</i>
<i>boogly friends! ♪</i>

21:32.158 --> 21:34.158
Honey, I'm home!

21:34.160 --> 21:36.727
We're watching<i> Googly.</i>

21:36.729 --> 21:39.430
I decided to stay young
and cute as long as I can.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.731
You can't control that, Augs.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.333
Nobody can control anything.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.168
Yeah. Might as well
learn that right now.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.503
(channel changes)

21:45.505 --> 21:47.538
Reporter:
<i>And in local news,</i>

21:47.539 --> 21:49.572
<i>one Greenwich Village family</i>
<i>has been found guilty</i>

21:49.575 --> 21:51.575
<i>of four counts</i>

21:51.577 --> 21:53.077
<i>When asked to comment,</i>

21:53.079 --> 21:55.246
<i>they said they would have</i>
<i>gotten away with it,</i>

21:55.248 --> 21:57.348

21:59.652 --> 22:03.020
<i>Just another reason</i>
<i>everybody should</i>

22:06.292 --> 22:07.591
What did you do?

22:07.593 --> 22:08.993
Nothin'.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.661
Nobody can--
can control nothin'.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.330
D-- dessert?

22:12.332 --> 22:13.931
Who wants dessert?

22:13.933 --> 22:15.666
I'll tell everybody
what they're having.
