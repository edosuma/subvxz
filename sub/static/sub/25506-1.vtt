01:18:52.409 --> 01:18:55.446
[EXCLAIMING]

01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:07.389
Oh, my God!
That's so cute.

01:19:07.391 --> 01:19:09.325
Oh, that's so cute.
I love your cat though.

01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:11.626
Let me give it a little kissie.
Kissie. Mwah!

01:19:11.628 --> 01:19:14.399
[IN MALE VOICE] Shit! I just broke a nail.
Sorry. Hold on.

01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:28.445
[ALL LAUGHING]

01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:36.117
I need her in another outfit,
this is what she's...

01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:37.354
[ALL LAUGHING]

01:19:45.997 --> 01:19:49.130
PRODUCER: Do you have some big driving,
acting moves planned for us today?

01:19:49.132 --> 01:19:51.332
Yeah, I've been working
on my donut holes

01:19:51.334 --> 01:19:53.669
and I'm a professional drifter.

01:19:53.671 --> 01:19:55.004
PRODUCER: Awesome.

01:19:55.006 --> 01:19:56.906
I just drift through life.

01:19:56.908 --> 01:19:57.909
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:07.051 --> 01:20:09.287
MAN: You're like a couple
of gag surgeons.

01:20:10.654 --> 01:20:12.487
...two, one.

01:20:12.489 --> 01:20:14.358
- Oh! We missed...
- [SCREAMS]

01:20:23.967 --> 01:20:26.234
You know nothing
about me is real.

01:20:26.236 --> 01:20:29.908
RYAN: Uh, there's other lines
that I don't pay attention to.

01:20:41.284 --> 01:20:43.652
MAN: Can you put this back
together for us really quick?

01:20:43.654 --> 01:20:45.586
We've already glued this one
and it's broken again.

01:20:45.588 --> 01:20:47.589
And then this part right here
needs something.

01:20:47.591 --> 01:20:49.660
And I'm going to try
and return it for $10.99.

01:20:59.669 --> 01:21:01.306
Why are you being so mean?

01:21:05.575 --> 01:21:08.445
What's my fucking line?
Shit!

01:21:32.403 --> 01:21:34.769
MAN 1: Look at that. That way
your writs aren't as loose.

01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:36.270
MAN 2: Let's see if you
can get out of those.

01:21:36.272 --> 01:21:37.706
See how hard it is
to get out of them.

01:21:37.708 --> 01:21:39.207
Okay. [LAUGHING]

01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:40.376
Houdini, they call me.

01:21:40.378 --> 01:21:41.777
MAN 2: Wow.
That's pretty amazing.

01:21:41.779 --> 01:21:43.248
Hey, she knows
who Houdini is.

01:21:48.452 --> 01:21:50.387
[MOANING]

01:21:53.591 --> 01:21:55.390
- You lost the bar.
- Oh, my God!

01:21:55.392 --> 01:21:57.162
[ALL LAUGHING]

01:22:02.565 --> 01:22:03.799
Captain Morgan.

01:22:03.801 --> 01:22:05.533
- DIRECTOR: Captain of the ship.
- Dale Morgan.

01:22:05.535 --> 01:22:07.268
What is my last name?

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:09.304
DIRECTOR: It's not
a well-thought-out script.

01:22:09.306 --> 01:22:10.642
[LAUGHING]

01:22:19.115 --> 01:22:20.616
Pussy!

01:22:20.618 --> 01:22:22.687
[PANTING]

01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:28.290
It's okay, it's all right.

01:22:28.292 --> 01:22:30.626
- [CRYING] I don't like her.
- Cut. It's all right.

01:22:30.628 --> 01:22:31.794
[LAUGHING]

01:22:31.796 --> 01:22:33.365
She reminds me of mom.

01:22:45.443 --> 01:22:46.841
DIRECTOR:
Move right, squirt left.

01:22:46.843 --> 01:22:48.743
- There you go.
- Now turn as little...

01:22:48.745 --> 01:22:50.214
Now pee towards us.
There you go.

01:22:56.087 --> 01:22:58.286
I love my penis. I love it.

01:22:58.288 --> 01:23:01.792
[IN MALE VOICE] Rumors are
you'd love it too. [LAUGHING]

01:23:08.766 --> 01:23:12.401
Sex with a ghost.
I wish.

01:23:12.403 --> 01:23:14.539
That is the
most ridiculous... Ooh!

01:23:15.372 --> 01:23:16.374
[MOANS]

01:23:17.373 --> 01:23:18.575
That was weird.

01:23:20.177 --> 01:23:21.346
Oh!

01:23:22.212 --> 01:23:23.347
[MOANS]

01:23:25.382 --> 01:23:27.519
Oh, I feel a sequel coming on.
[GASPS]

01:23:28.651 --> 01:23:31.319
[MOANING]
I can't wait.

01:23:31.321 --> 01:23:32.489
I want it now!
