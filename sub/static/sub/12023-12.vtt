there, let's go.

12:58.419 --> 13:03.557
Narrator: - 2,000 miles northwest
in Fairbanks, Alaska... - Mark!

13:03.559 --> 13:04.524
What's going on, Jack?

13:04.526 --> 13:05.225
Good.

13:05.227 --> 13:06.126
We got something going today?

13:06.128 --> 13:08.929
Narrator: The haul road ace is
looking to get back on top of

13:08.931 --> 13:10.864
the load count.

13:10.866 --> 13:13.067
How about this
mixed-up load here?

13:13.134 --> 13:18.305
You got a stop at mile 339.

13:18.373 --> 13:21.208
Live offload.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.576
They're hot for this freight.

13:22.578 --> 13:25.446
There is a little bit more that's gotta
go all the way into Prudhoe Bay.

13:25.448 --> 13:26.814
There you go, big boy.

13:26.881 --> 13:27.648
All right, thanks, Mark.

13:27.650 --> 13:28.916
All right, Jack.

13:28.918 --> 13:29.583
We'll see you later.

13:29.585 --> 13:30.918
All right, stay out of trouble.

13:30.985 --> 13:33.053
Narrator: Today Jack's pulling
double duty with a load

13:33.055 --> 13:35.021
headed to Prudhoe Bay.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.457
I got a lot to get done today.

13:37.459 --> 13:43.029
And another that has to be offloaded
by hand on the side of the Dalton.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.632
It's looking good.

13:45.634 --> 13:48.134
This ought to be a nice load.

13:48.136 --> 13:55.376
Narrator: - Back at the office...
- Good morning, Chop.

13:55.378 --> 13:56.577
What's up, buddy?

13:56.579 --> 13:57.444
What have we got today?

13:57.446 --> 13:58.512
Anything good?

13:58.514 --> 14:01.114
How about this
mixed-up load here?

14:01.116 --> 14:04.251
Got a little bit of
everything on it.

14:04.318 --> 14:09.323
Narrator: Porkchop's also dispatched
with a load bound for the oil fields.

14:09.325 --> 14:14.296
And we're gonna make you
run with Jack Jessee.

14:14.363 --> 14:18.300
Narrator: And he'll be running with
Jack to help with the extra offload.

14:18.302 --> 14:20.269
He should be over there
inspecting the loads and getting

14:20.271 --> 14:22.972
ready to go right now.

14:22.974 --> 14:25.275
It's a pleasure to run up with
him and see what happens.

14:25.277 --> 14:26.976
It's always nice to
go up in a pair.

14:26.978 --> 14:28.544
Safety in numbers, big boy.

14:28.546 --> 14:29.679
Yup. That's right.

14:29.681 --> 14:30.646
All right, man.

14:30.648 --> 14:31.881
Any questions?

14:31.883 --> 14:32.848
Uh, nope.

14:32.850 --> 14:33.883
I'm gonna get out of here, man.

14:33.885 --> 14:35.384
All right, see you later.

14:35.386 --> 14:38.721
Narrator: But he's not
happy being slowed down.

14:38.723 --> 14:39.555
I'm not here to drag ass.

14:39.557 --> 14:41.023
I'm here to drive a truck.

14:41.025 --> 14:42.025
He can go on his own.

14:42.027 --> 14:45.228
I don't need that shit.

14:45.230 --> 14:46.729
Porkchop.

14:46.731 --> 14:47.663
What's going on?

14:47.665 --> 14:48.664
Let's do this.

14:48.666 --> 14:50.099
See you out in the yard.

14:50.101 --> 14:53.102
All right.

14:53.104 --> 14:54.303
Going on the road with Jack.

14:54.305 --> 14:55.204
It is what it is.

14:55.206 --> 14:56.372
Roll with the punches.

14:56.374 --> 14:59.309
We do the buddy system thing
because its cold and you

14:59.311 --> 15:02.946
don't wanna take any
chances up here.

15:02.948 --> 15:05.548
This sucks.

15:05.550 --> 15:11.554
Let's get out of here.

15:11.556 --> 15:12.388
Play the game.

15:12.390 --> 15:15.491
That's all you can do.

15:16.960 --> 15:21.963
Narrator: - 250 miles up the Dalton...
- I've been out here by myself.

15:21.965 --> 15:25.834
I always want to get out of Fairbanks
bright and early in the morning.

15:25.902 --> 15:30.973
Narrator: Load count leader Darrell Ward
is already a step ahead of Jack Jessee.

15:30.975 --> 15:34.744
The ace, I know he's
back there somewhere.

15:34.746 --> 15:36.679
Maybe knock the ace
off the throne.

15:36.681 --> 15:40.384
It would be... priceless.

15:40.386 --> 15:46.456
Narrator: He's halfway up the road
with a tanker of machine oil.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.559
It's kind of a disappointment
missing Reno's basketball

15:48.561 --> 15:55.999
season, but you gotta have a job, gotta
work, to pay for his way through college.

15:56.001 --> 15:58.535
You know, Reno
understands that.

15:58.537 --> 16:00.971
I'll try to get a hold of him
when I get out into Prudhoe.

16:00.973 --> 16:03.473
I haven't talked to
him for a few days.

16:03.475 --> 16:06.143
Get the show on the road.

16:06.145 --> 16:09.847
Narrator: But as he hits
the North Slope...

16:09.849 --> 16:12.149
The farther north I'm going,
the colder it's getting.

16:12.151 --> 16:15.086
Narrator: The
temperature plummets.

16:15.088 --> 16:17.722
It's down to 47 below now.

16:17.724 --> 16:18.623
It's cold out there.

16:18.625 --> 16:23.862
It's not anyplace you want to
hang out outside for very long.

16:23.864 --> 16:26.365
[Beeping]

16:26.367 --> 16:31.571
All right, here we go.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.373
What the hell?

16:33.375 --> 16:35.942
I'm getting warning lights
going off and beepers.

16:35.944 --> 16:38.310
I don't know what's going on.

16:38.312 --> 16:43.181
Check engine.

16:43.183 --> 16:49.488
Well, I'm gonna pull over here, make
sure everything's doing all right.

16:49.490 --> 16:50.756
I don't know what's going on.

16:50.758 --> 16:52.859
I'll get her figured
out, though.

16:52.861 --> 16:57.597
It's damn near 50
below 0 out here.

17:07.275 --> 17:08.843
Yep.

17:08.845 --> 17:11.145
Alternator has gone to shit.

17:11.146 --> 17:13.613
Belts are still running.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.315
She ain't charging.

17:15.317 --> 17:20.653
Narrator: Darrell's best guess is
that the alternator's going out.

17:20.655 --> 17:23.255
That's all I needed to know.

17:23.257 --> 17:27.526
- But still 30 miles from Prudhoe Bay...
- See if she'll make it.

17:27.528 --> 17:29.728
Hopefully it's running good.

17:29.730 --> 17:35.168
Narrator: There's no
choice but to press on.

17:35.170 --> 17:36.169
[Engine falters]

17:36.171 --> 17:39.406
You've got to be kidding me.

17:39.408 --> 17:42.376
Come on.

17:42.378 --> 17:44.411
[Engine won't turn]

17:44.413 --> 17:52.619
Come on.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.655
We're not going anywhere.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.158
My truck's dead.

17:57.160 --> 18:05.734
I'm the only truck here.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.802
Whoo!

18:07.804 --> 18:11.005
Damn sure chilly.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.574
Narrator: Without any source
of heat, hypothermia and

18:13.576 --> 18:18.813
frostbite can set
in within minutes.

18:18.815 --> 18:23.750
Build a campfire in here
in a minute, damn it.

18:23.752 --> 18:27.287
Narrator: Darrell only has
two options for survival--

18:27.289 --> 18:32.992
- wait for a passing truck...
- Oh, it's cold.

18:32.994 --> 18:37.764
Narrator: Or pray his phone
is in range of Prudhoe Bay.

18:40.667 --> 18:46.372
[Line ringing]

18:56.783 --> 18:58.183
Hello, it's Kevin.

18:58.185 --> 19:01.320
Hey, Kevin, it's Darrell here.

19:01.322 --> 19:02.221
My alternator's dead.

19:02.223 --> 19:03.022
I have no power.

19:03.024 --> 19:05.824
Oh, alternator problem, huh?

19:05.826 --> 19:08.861
So I just shut all my switches
and gadgets off, and

19:08.863 --> 19:12.698
I'm sitting over here
freezing my ass off.

19:12.700 --> 19:13.932
All right, cool, send him over.

19:13.934 --> 19:17.770
Yep, send him over and send
some hot chocolate with him.

19:17.772 --> 19:19.872
Take care of my hypothermia.

19:19.874 --> 19:21.640
I don't have anything
to drink in here.

19:21.642 --> 19:25.944
My water's frozen.

19:25.946 --> 19:27.612
All right, thanks, Kevin.

19:27.614 --> 19:29.214
Yeah, bye.

19:29.216 --> 19:32.518
Fuck.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.119
I don't know what they're
bringing or how they're doing

19:34.121 --> 19:39.324
it, but they know where I'm at and
they know what my problem is and...

19:39.326 --> 19:41.426
I need some hot chocolate.

19:41.428 --> 19:46.431
I need something warm to drink 'cause
my water ain't working for me.

19:52.204 --> 19:57.609
Narrator: 200 miles up
Alaska's Dalton highway...

19:57.611 --> 20:00.345
This is my longest
load of the year.

20:00.347 --> 20:02.947
We're 100 feet long,
bumper to bumper.

20:02.949 --> 20:05.316
Narrator: 23-year-old Austin
Wheeler heads to the

20:05.318 --> 20:08.486
oil fields with a
load of long pipe.

20:08.488 --> 20:10.421
I've never hauled
pipe on a pipe dolly.

20:10.423 --> 20:16.227
This is my first time.

20:16.229 --> 20:18.396
Man, this looks a little hairy.

20:18.398 --> 20:20.498
I am a tad nervous.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.866
Hopefully everything goes well.

20:22.868 --> 20:29.539
[Horn blares]

20:29.607 --> 20:33.376
Long pipe southbound.

20:33.443 --> 20:36.712
Narrator: Pilot driver Carl
Reynolds is out ahead,

20:36.714 --> 20:41.984
warning other drivers to stay
clear of the extra long load.

20:41.986 --> 20:44.620
It's just more
difficult all around.

20:44.622 --> 20:51.861
You've got to know where that tail
end of that dolly is all the time.

20:51.863 --> 20:54.464
Narrator: It's been a struggle
to keep the rear dolly

20:54.466 --> 20:55.799
from hitting on-coming traffic.

20:55.801 --> 21:00.905
[Horn blares]

21:00.973 --> 21:03.274
Whenever we pass trucks like,
this I just wanna be able

21:03.276 --> 21:08.146
to see how close we are
to the ditch line.

21:08.214 --> 21:10.883
What is that?

21:10.885 --> 21:14.087
Narrator: But now Austin
faces a new threat.

21:14.089 --> 21:20.426
Looks like his dolly
is a little off.

21:20.428 --> 21:22.161
Hey, Austin.

21:22.163 --> 21:23.229
Go ahead.

21:23.231 --> 21:31.704
Do you know it looks like your dolly
is a little off to the right?

21:31.706 --> 21:35.274
Oh, shit!

21:35.276 --> 21:38.210
Oh my, God, please, no.

21:38.212 --> 21:41.647
Narrator: The pipe dolly
is drifting to the right,

21:41.649 --> 21:45.383
dangerously close to the ditch.

21:45.385 --> 21:49.920
When you load the long pipe on
the dollies, the truck and

21:49.922 --> 21:53.157
the dolly has to be
in perfect alignment.

21:53.159 --> 21:57.494
If it tracks too much to the
right, you risk the chance of

21:57.496 --> 22:02.967
the truck getting pulled
off the road by it.

22:02.969 --> 22:06.104
Inexperience doesn't
help either.

22:06.106 --> 22:09.174
[Horn blares]

22:09.176 --> 22:12.844
We're going to have to stop at
the bakers knob and see if

22:12.846 --> 22:18.316
Carl can help me fix it.

22:18.318 --> 22:23.255
Hey, Carl, how much do you think
that truck of yours weighs?

22:23.257 --> 22:25.925
It scales out at 10,000.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.226
About 5 tons?

22:27.228 --> 22:28.227
That's perfect.

22:28.229 --> 22:30.964
I'm gonna pull over.

22:34.935 --> 22:39.439
Move on along the back.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.774
- So...
- What's up?

22:40.776 --> 22:42.776
What I was thinking is we'll
pull the pick-up behind the

22:42.778 --> 22:46.046
dolly, then I'll chain off to
your front tow hooks here, and

22:46.048 --> 22:47.914
I'll ease forward.

22:47.916 --> 22:48.615
Yeah.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.851
And we'll hook a chain to the
left to the driver's side of the

22:50.853 --> 22:53.386
dolly so it kinda
uses it as an anchor.

22:53.388 --> 22:55.655
And hopefully we can
pull it this way.

22:55.657 --> 22:59.626
Narrator: Austin's plan--
anchor off to the pilot truck

22:59.628 --> 23:03.363
and pull forward to
realign his load.

23:03.365 --> 23:07.934
The thing about it is, if we pull too
much, we'll pull it out of alignment.

23:07.936 --> 23:10.636
Narrator: If he gets it wrong,
the dolly could be pulled

23:10.638 --> 23:17.344
further off-center, making
it impossible to haul.

23:17.346 --> 23:18.611
Okay, Carl, you ready?

23:18.613 --> 23:20.447
All right, here we go.

23:20.449 --> 23:22.082
All right, go for it.

23:25.086 --> 23:27.053
Okay.

23:37.365 --> 23:38.164
There you go.

23:38.166 --> 23:41.234
Pull nice and easy.

23:41.236 --> 23:43.670
[Static]

23:55.182 --> 23:56.916
All right, that's
probably good, huh?

23:56.918 --> 24:00.753
A little bit more.

24:00.755 --> 24:05.724
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

24:05.726 --> 24:08.860
I think that might do it there.

24:08.862 --> 24:10.729
Good right there.

24:10.731 --> 24:13.831
Narrator: - Finally...
- Sweet call.

24:13.833 --> 24:14.866
That worked, man.

24:14.868 --> 24:18.470
Narrator: The dolly is straight
and ready to hit the road again.

24:18.472 --> 24:19.170
Good deal.

24:19.172 --> 24:21.539
Yeah, I could definitely see
it in my mirrors pull the

24:21.541 --> 24:23.642
front around, so that
was what I wanted.

24:23.644 --> 24:25.076
It's a good truck.

24:25.078 --> 24:26.511
Right on.

24:26.513 --> 24:32.918
Let's get on the road.

24:32.985 --> 24:38.089
Narrator: 2,100 miles to the
southeast in Manitoba...

24:38.091 --> 24:40.625
This time we're gonna make
it all the way to Wasagamack.

24:40.627 --> 24:43.294
Narrator: Hugh and Rick
are back on the road.

24:43.296 --> 24:45.263
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

24:45.265 --> 24:45.997
[Horn blares]

24:45.999 --> 24:48.133
Narrator: After Rick's
collision with a winter roads

24:48.135 --> 24:52.470
official... cost them time and

24:52.505 --> 24:55.273
didn't help their reputation.

24:55.275 --> 24:58.876
Yeah, you were traveling a
little bit too fast, eh?

24:58.944 --> 25:00.712
I was coming down that
fucking hill there, and I--

25:00.714 --> 25:03.348
Fuck, I couldn't get
slowed down or nothing.

25:03.350 --> 25:09.588
I'm just picking up speed every
time I tried to stop.

25:09.590 --> 25:13.525
Rick needs to make
a few bucks here.

25:13.592 --> 25:15.760
I don't know what he's gonna do.

25:15.762 --> 25:21.266
He can't blame
anybody but himself.

25:21.268 --> 25:25.036
Narrator: Hugh's pushing Rick to
deliver their loads by day's end.

25:25.038 --> 25:30.608
But now standing in their way
is the 11th largest freshwater

25:30.610 --> 25:33.978
lake in the world.

25:33.980 --> 25:37.314
I just pulled into the start of
Winnipeg Lake crossing here.

25:37.316 --> 25:41.619
I brought a load up on
Thursday and went across here.

25:41.687 --> 25:45.724
I come back out, and two guys,
rookies, going across the

25:45.726 --> 25:48.327
pressure ridge, blew the
fucking bridge out.

25:48.395 --> 25:51.363
They had to close her down for a
couple of days to fix it, so...

25:51.365 --> 25:52.431
She's open again now.

25:52.433 --> 25:57.136
We're gonna try her again today
here and get across here.

25:57.138 --> 26:00.273
Narrator: A pressure ridge is
like a mountain range that forms

26:00.275 --> 26:05.078
in the middle of the lake where two
massive sheets of ice collide.

26:05.080 --> 26:09.315
For semis to cross this gap,
road crews have to maintain

26:09.317 --> 26:14.821
- a fragile manmade bridge...
- Are you ready?

26:14.823 --> 26:17.523
Yes, sir.

26:35.009 --> 26:38.779
Now we do what we
do-- ice road trucking.

26:46.154 --> 26:49.857
On the ice.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.425
I'm just watching
the cracks here.

26:51.427 --> 26:56.364
There's lots of linear
cracks going down here.

26:56.366 --> 26:59.600
As I go by, as I go over top,
they just open up like this and

26:59.602 --> 27:06.008
then close back up.

27:06.010 --> 27:06.675
Pretty wild.

27:06.677 --> 27:09.145
You can tell the ice
ain't very thick.

27:09.147 --> 27:12.381
[Ice cracking]

27:12.383 --> 27:14.517
Ah, like they say, by the time
you notice what's going on,

27:14.519 --> 27:22.691
you're already underwater anyway, so...
That isn't even running through your mind.

27:24.928 --> 27:26.996
Narrator: At the deepest
part of the lake...

27:26.998 --> 27:29.532
Yeah, you can see where they
blew her out right here, right

27:29.534 --> 27:31.233
down the middle of her.

27:31.235 --> 27:34.636
Narrator: Hugh reaches
the pressure ridge.

27:34.638 --> 27:43.545
That's actually open
water in there.

27:43.547 --> 27:50.452
Oh, she's gonna be rough.

27:50.454 --> 27:51.954
Fuck.

27:51.956 --> 27:53.622
Hold on!

27:55.648 --> 27:58.750
- In the middle of Lake Winnipeg...
- Now you can see where they

27:58.752 --> 27:59.784
blew her out right here.

27:59.786 --> 28:02.754
Narrator: Hugh gets ready
to make the jump from one

28:02.756 --> 28:06.157
giant sheet of ice to another.

28:06.159 --> 28:11.696
Oh, she's gonna be rough.

28:11.698 --> 28:13.064
Fuck.

28:13.066 --> 28:17.168
Hold on.

28:17.170 --> 28:18.769
Easy now.

28:34.820 --> 28:36.321
Yup.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.189
That's the end of her.

28:38.191 --> 28:42.427
I'm up. I'm safe.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.096
I'm just crossing it now.

28:44.098 --> 28:46.765
Okay, 10-4.

28:46.767 --> 28:50.036
Narrator: Now it's Rick's turn.

28:59.647 --> 29:00.947
Oh, boy.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.165
Good deal.

29:17.167 --> 29:21.370
Let's roll.

29:21.372 --> 29:26.509
Narrator: Back on dry land,
Hugh and Rick push on, hoping

29:26.511 --> 29:30.879
to make it to Wasagamack
without stopping.

29:30.881 --> 29:32.314
[Horn blares]

29:32.316 --> 29:35.150
Let's get her done.

29:36.686 --> 29:45.628
Narrator: 2,100 miles to the northwest...
in Alaska's frozen tundra...

29:45.630 --> 29:47.429
Damn sure chilly.

29:47.431 --> 29:53.335
Narrator: Darrell Ward is stranded
at 50 below... with no heat.

29:53.337 --> 29:55.036
I don't know what they're
bringing or how they're doing

29:55.038 --> 29:59.842
it, but they know where I'm at,
and they know what my problem is.

29:59.844 --> 30:01.576
Narrator: Help is on the way.

30:01.578 --> 30:03.178
Ooh, and it is cold out here.

30:03.180 --> 30:04.580
It's nasty.

30:04.582 --> 30:12.721
Narrator: But in these extreme
temperatures, every second counts.

30:12.723 --> 30:16.992
- With nothing to do but wait...
- I got to get a hold of Reno.

30:16.994 --> 30:19.061
I haven't talked to
him for a few days.

30:19.063 --> 30:22.865
I know he's probably starting
to wonder what happened to me.

30:22.867 --> 30:27.402
Narrator: Darrell looks to family to
take his mind off the brutal cold.

30:27.404 --> 30:28.437
Hello.

30:28.439 --> 30:30.305
What are you doing, Reno?

30:30.307 --> 30:35.278
Nothing. Just got on the bus after the
championship double overtime game.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.448
So now divisions are over
and you're going to State?

30:38.450 --> 30:40.950
Yeah, going to state,
number one team.

30:40.952 --> 30:42.118
[Chuckles]

30:42.120 --> 30:45.189
It's the first time
we beat 'em all year.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.356
[Indistinct] Right time.

30:46.358 --> 30:47.491
How much you win by?

30:47.493 --> 30:52.095
53-50.

30:52.097 --> 30:54.097
How's everything going at home?

30:54.099 --> 30:54.898
Good.

30:54.900 --> 30:55.699
Good?

30:55.701 --> 30:56.433
Right on.

30:56.435 --> 30:57.167
Yup.

30:57.169 --> 31:02.472
Well, I'm gonna have to get
rolling here and get on the road.

31:02.474 --> 31:04.707
I'm hooked up to a tanker,
get headed up north.

31:04.709 --> 31:06.710
Yeah, we're just getting into
Missoula anyways, and we're

31:06.712 --> 31:08.211
gonna have to go in here to eat.

31:08.213 --> 31:10.947
Tell everybody good luck at
State, and, if they lose, I'm

31:10.949 --> 31:14.484
- gonna come down and kick
their ass, and... - All right.

31:14.486 --> 31:16.252
I'm proud of you, Reno.

31:16.254 --> 31:16.986
Yeah, talk to you later.

31:16.988 --> 31:17.753
Love you.

31:17.755 --> 31:19.121
Okay, love you too. Bye.

31:19.123 --> 31:23.192
Bye.

31:23.194 --> 31:26.462
Reminds me what I'm doing
this for, you know.

31:35.470 --> 31:37.338
[Horn beeps]

31:37.340 --> 31:40.107
Yes!

31:40.109 --> 31:46.646
Narrator: Finally, a loader from
Prudhoe Bay comes to Darrell's rescue.

31:46.648 --> 31:48.281
Oh, it's cold out here!

31:48.283 --> 31:49.849
Whoo!

31:49.851 --> 31:52.919
So I'm just gonna yard you out and
pick you up and then carry you back.

31:52.921 --> 31:53.753
Okay.

31:53.755 --> 31:54.821
Nice hat.

31:54.823 --> 31:56.389
Thanks.

31:56.391 --> 31:57.290
It's warm.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.325
You want me to take
a spin on that?

31:59.327 --> 32:01.494
Have at it, and I'll
go get hooked up.

32:01.496 --> 32:02.429
All right.

32:02.431 --> 32:04.431
Are you sure?

32:04.433 --> 32:07.167
You got a straight trailer
de-rigged from here.

32:07.169 --> 32:10.805
Carlile can bring the other
trucks over, snatch this trailer

32:10.807 --> 32:15.210
up, and take her to town.

32:15.212 --> 32:17.779
There you go.

32:17.781 --> 32:21.583
This is a good thing, you know.

32:21.585 --> 32:24.719
I'd really be screwed.

32:24.721 --> 32:26.755
Thank God.

32:26.757 --> 32:31.760
[Beeping]

32:31.762 --> 32:38.333
Narrator: As night falls on
Darrell's disastrous day...

32:38.335 --> 32:40.301
Porkchop, when you come
around that switchback right

32:40.303 --> 32:44.438
here, stay way to the outside,
you go around it a lot easier.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.307
I'm hugging the outside
wall in the groove, by God.

32:47.309 --> 32:51.478
Narrator: Porkchop and Jack
Jessee reach the North Slope.

32:51.480 --> 32:54.214
Running with Jack,
coming up here.

32:54.216 --> 32:56.082
Don't really like it.

32:56.084 --> 32:59.786
The only problem with Jack Jesse
is he's on Jack Jessee time.

32:59.788 --> 33:01.421
But I gots to make my own.

33:01.423 --> 33:04.057
My pockets is hungry.

33:04.059 --> 33:10.164
My pockets is hungry.

33:10.166 --> 33:12.299
Hey, Chop, I gotta
stop here and offload.

33:12.301 --> 33:18.372
It shouldn't take much
more than an hour there.

33:18.374 --> 33:21.542
Narrator: Jack has to drop off
part of his load for workers

33:21.544 --> 33:23.478
who are repairing the pipeline.

33:23.480 --> 33:27.181
So I think we are going out
to where those lights are.

33:27.183 --> 33:29.684
That's where I'm
offloading, I think.

33:29.686 --> 33:32.054
Narrator: In these frigid
North Slope temperatures,

33:32.056 --> 33:37.993
Jack's relying on Porkchop to help him
offload quickly and get back on the road.

33:37.995 --> 33:47.169
Trying to make contact with the
construction crew going on here.

33:47.171 --> 33:53.041
It's been good riding with you,
and I'll see you in the morning.

33:53.043 --> 33:59.747
Narrator: But Porkchop
has a change of plans.

33:59.749 --> 34:05.385
Porkchop, where are you, man?

34:05.387 --> 34:10.223
He didn't leave me
out here, did he?

34:10.225 --> 34:12.692
Jack had to stop back there and
unload part of his load, so

34:12.694 --> 34:15.295
it's a simple fact that
we can't run together.

34:15.297 --> 34:16.463
You know, we're truck drivers.

34:16.465 --> 34:19.065
We're not always going to the
same place, we're not always

34:19.067 --> 34:25.306
delivering the same thing.

34:25.308 --> 34:28.476
Porkchop, where you at?

34:28.478 --> 34:31.913
Are you kidding me, he left?

34:38.553 --> 34:44.726
We are not truck drivers
from down South.

34:44.728 --> 34:47.527
You don't do that shit up here.

34:47.530 --> 34:49.630
I'm not happy with him.

34:49.632 --> 34:53.668
Narrator: While Jack offloads
alone in 50 below...

34:53.670 --> 34:56.437
- 25 miles up the road...
- I don't see where there

34:56.438 --> 34:57.739
should be any hard feelings.

34:57.741 --> 35:00.642
I like him, but I can't pull his
weight the whole rest of the time.

35:00.644 --> 35:03.211
If I sit around and wait on him
the whole damn time, I'm not

35:03.213 --> 35:05.046
gonna make no money for myself.

35:05.048 --> 35:14.957
Every now and then, you gotta branch off
and take care of your own business.

35:14.959 --> 35:17.794
Narrator: An hour later, back
at the offload sight...

35:17.796 --> 35:20.730
I got a couple more things to clean up,
and then I'll be out of your hair.

35:20.732 --> 35:21.865
All right, safe travels, man.

35:21.867 --> 35:28.405
Okay, man, thanks.

35:28.407 --> 35:33.877
He knew I had to stop and offload
right there, to help me do my job.

35:33.879 --> 35:37.415
You got a lot to learn
about real truck drivers.

35:37.417 --> 35:46.025
Narrator: By the time Jack rolls out...
Porkchop's already made it to Prudhoe Bay.

35:46.027 --> 35:48.527
What a beautiful night
in Prudhoe, baby!

35:48.529 --> 35:50.195
Whoo!

35:50.197 --> 35:53.298
Narrator: And has his mind
only on the load count.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.834
When I pass Jack Jessee and I
pass Darrell Ward, they're

35:55.836 --> 36:01.339
gonna scratch their head and
say, "What the hell was that?"

36:04.643 --> 36:10.113
There's a little bit more to it
than just trying to get loads.

36:12.049 --> 36:14.684
As far as I am concerned,
he's burned that bridge.

36:14.686 --> 36:19.623
I don't give second chances.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.826
Narrator: - Coming up...
- You put me in a bad spot.

36:21.828 --> 36:24.461
Narrator: Jack's
looking for answers.

36:24.463 --> 36:27.398
So you want me to just sit with my finger
up my rear while you get unloaded?

36:27.400 --> 36:28.299
That's what we do sometimes.

36:28.301 --> 36:29.066
In the middle of the road?

36:29.602 --> 36:31.102
That's BS, man. You know.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.168
[Horn blares]

36:33.170 --> 36:35.904
Narrator: On the remote
Canadian winter roads...

36:35.906 --> 36:39.575
Well, we just come by
the 300 kilometer sign.

36:39.577 --> 36:43.045
So we can't have much more
than about 40 clicks left.

36:43.047 --> 36:46.983
Narrator: Hugh and Rick are powering
through a day of delays...

36:46.985 --> 36:48.218
Lets get her done.

36:48.220 --> 36:51.054
Fucking shit.

36:51.056 --> 36:54.624
Narrator: Hoping to reach the
outpost of Wasagamack without

36:54.626 --> 36:56.926
another stop.

36:56.928 --> 37:00.663
Big one coming.

37:00.665 --> 37:03.833
Ho ho ho.

37:03.835 --> 37:05.435
Easy!

37:05.437 --> 37:09.672
Narrator: But on his first day back
on the job, the rough roads...

37:09.674 --> 37:11.808
Pretty hard on the kidneys
this year, that's for sure.

37:11.810 --> 37:16.413
Narrator: Are taking
a toll on Rick.

37:16.481 --> 37:19.483
Right now I'm feeling
pretty tired.

37:19.485 --> 37:22.319
I'm still fighting
this cold off.

37:22.321 --> 37:23.721
I could use a rest, man.

37:23.723 --> 37:26.591
They're counting on
us to get it there.

37:26.593 --> 37:29.694
They're counting on you.

37:29.696 --> 37:31.563
And like I said, the thing's
fucking-kicking me.

37:31.565 --> 37:35.199
I'm still tired.

37:35.201 --> 37:39.470
Time to earn your keep.

37:41.573 --> 37:44.875
It's not my fault I'm
fucking exhausted.

37:44.877 --> 37:48.778
She's a hard old goal, but you don't
see anybody else fucking doing her.

37:48.780 --> 37:49.612
Well, now I'm not nice.

37:49.614 --> 37:50.980
Now I'm a fucker.

37:50.982 --> 37:53.382
This is no longer fun.

37:53.450 --> 37:59.889
That's the way we're playing
the game, truck gets parked.

37:59.957 --> 38:04.427
I'm just not driving anymore.

38:07.231 --> 38:10.466
Narrator: Less than 10 miles
from their destination...

38:10.468 --> 38:12.869
There's St. Theresa's work yard.

38:12.871 --> 38:15.972
There's a yard that
we can park at.

38:16.039 --> 38:20.543
Narrator: Rick calls it a night.

38:20.545 --> 38:22.179
Okay, we made her
to St. Theresa.

38:22.181 --> 38:23.613
We didn't make her
to Wasagamack.

38:23.615 --> 38:26.016
We fucked around
too much today.

38:26.018 --> 38:30.253
We'll have to see if we can line
something up tomorrow to get unloaded.

38:30.255 --> 38:34.358
Probably waste a whole
day here tomorrow.

38:34.426 --> 38:35.793
We're cool, though, right?

38:35.795 --> 38:39.097
Yep, we're cool.

38:39.164 --> 38:40.965
Yeah, well, a shot of beer,
and I'm hitting that fucking

38:40.967 --> 38:44.169
fart sack, 'cause I'm tired.

38:44.171 --> 38:45.371
Get some sleep.

38:45.373 --> 38:47.006
You can sleep in may.

38:47.008 --> 38:51.678
That's what I always
tell everybody.

38:55.516 --> 39:00.620
Narrator: The next morning at
the Carlile yard in Prudhoe Bay...

39:00.622 --> 39:02.622
Let's go see what dispatch
has got for me today.

39:02.624 --> 39:06.359
Narrator: Porkchop hits dispatch
looking for a backhaul,

39:06.361 --> 39:12.498
but he's not the only one.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.265
What's going on, Jack?

39:13.267 --> 39:14.066
Hey, Kevin.

39:14.068 --> 39:15.468
What do we got?

39:15.470 --> 39:16.669
What we got going back?

39:16.671 --> 39:19.005
I got a deck set going back.

39:19.007 --> 39:21.274
If you wanna haul that out
for me, I'd appreciate it.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.176
Okay. Not a problem.

39:23.178 --> 39:25.412
I need to talk to
you for a second.

39:25.414 --> 39:31.785
Sure, let's do it.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.520
I gotta talk to you
about last night, man.

39:33.522 --> 39:34.421
All right.

39:34.423 --> 39:36.189
You put me in a bad spot.

39:36.191 --> 39:38.991
Leaving me out there when we
were all buddied up the whole

39:38.993 --> 39:40.993
trip, you know, what if
something would have happened?

39:40.995 --> 39:42.862
So you want me to just sit with
my finger up my rear while

39:42.864 --> 39:43.829
you get unloaded?

39:43.831 --> 39:45.230
That's what we do
up here sometimes.

39:45.232 --> 39:45.931
In the middle of the road?

39:45.933 --> 39:46.599
Yeah, exactly.

39:46.601 --> 39:47.733
That's BS, man. You know it.

39:47.735 --> 39:49.000
No. Not up here it's not.

39:49.002 --> 39:49.768
Maybe in the states.

39:49.770 --> 39:52.237
I understand you can't stop on
the interstate, but this is not

39:52.239 --> 39:54.039
the interstate road,
this is the haul road.

39:54.041 --> 39:58.944
If you need to stop wherever and
wait on somebody, you do that.

39:58.946 --> 40:00.745
Everybody on this
road understands.

40:00.747 --> 40:02.413
So just pull over on
the side of the road?

40:02.415 --> 40:03.681
Yeah, if you have to do that.

40:03.683 --> 40:05.517
If it needs to be done.

40:05.519 --> 40:08.319
We still had 70 miles to go on
and get in there, you know.

40:08.321 --> 40:11.523
If something would have happened
to me and you're out of radio

40:11.525 --> 40:13.792
range, what was I
supposed to do?

40:13.794 --> 40:15.694
We do things
differently up here.

40:15.696 --> 40:17.530
It's a lot more
relying on everybody.

40:17.532 --> 40:20.600
These conditions, they're
just too dangerous.

40:20.602 --> 40:21.634
Get this job.

40:21.636 --> 40:22.669
Get this done.

40:22.671 --> 40:25.906
We got a lot more to do.

40:25.908 --> 40:27.440
Jack Jessee.

40:27.442 --> 40:29.109
Hell, I feel like I'm back in
high school getting called to

40:29.111 --> 40:33.513
the principal's office.

40:33.515 --> 40:36.116
I don't know what it is with him,
but you know... there's no

40:36.118 --> 40:39.018
need for all that shit.

40:39.020 --> 40:44.758
The haul road ace has now become
the haul road ass, in my opinion.

40:48.296 --> 40:50.197
Porkchop's gonna have to
have a talk with Lane.

40:50.199 --> 40:52.866
I've got to inform him on this.

40:52.868 --> 40:57.704
Somebody's gotta
straighten that out.

40:59.740 --> 41:02.808
Narrator: Jack moves into a tie
for the top spot after his

41:02.810 --> 41:10.115
double delivery, while Darrell's
breakdown stalled his load count lead.

41:10.183 --> 41:14.086
- Back at Prudhoe dispatch...
- Hey, Kevin. What's up, man?

41:14.088 --> 41:15.187
What's happening, Austin?

41:15.189 --> 41:18.256
Oh, just seeing-- I brought
that load of long pipe in.

41:18.258 --> 41:20.158
Sweet.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.293
What are you doing, Austin?

41:21.295 --> 41:21.960
Hey, Darrell.

41:21.962 --> 41:22.728
How are you, man?

41:22.730 --> 41:24.429
You know how I am.

41:24.431 --> 41:26.031
I guess I don't know.

41:26.033 --> 41:27.532
My truck broke down.

41:27.534 --> 41:28.200
Oh, it is?

41:28.202 --> 41:28.967
Yeah.

41:28.969 --> 41:29.635
Oh, man.

41:29.637 --> 41:31.170
All my dash lights,
everything was off.

41:31.172 --> 41:31.837
Alternator.

41:31.839 --> 41:33.906
I reached up, I hit my throttle,
revved it up a little

41:33.908 --> 41:37.143
bit, you know, and it idled down,
it went all the way to shut off.

41:37.145 --> 41:37.811
Oh, dang.

41:37.813 --> 41:39.079
The battery's totally dead.

41:39.081 --> 41:40.747
What are you going to do?

41:40.749 --> 41:43.117
Sitting over at deadhorse.

41:43.119 --> 41:46.520
Another dead horse
at deadhorse.

41:46.522 --> 41:48.856
I'll pull him home.

41:48.858 --> 41:51.981
Well, that'd be better than me
waiting here for two days--

41:52.130 --> 41:54.244
Well, yeah, then you could have the
shop put an alternator in, and

41:54.339 --> 41:56.393
- you wouldn't have to do it.
- Sounds like a plan. - All right.

41:56.628 --> 41:58.843
I'll just take the ride
with Austin.

41:58.955 --> 42:01.511
Yeah, and Darrell and I can
talk about Porkchop and Jack...

42:01.603 --> 42:03.896
Yeah, no doubt.
Right on. I appreciate it.

42:03.992 --> 42:05.511
Yeah, no problem.
Let's go.

42:13.103 --> 42:16.082
That's what I do for
our Carlile friends.

42:16.818 --> 42:18.978
All right.
Let's get out of here.

42:22.010 --> 42:25.363
Make sure you don't pull
Porkchop's trailer sitting back there.

42:26.295 --> 42:28.883
I think they get to
Fairbanks without my truck.

42:30.122 --> 42:32.397
Nothing stops the Chop!

42:32.544 --> 42:36.261
Except for Atigun,
the Beaver Slide,

42:36.553 --> 42:39.168
not hooking to your trailer,
I mean, all * Porkchop

42:39.310 --> 42:41.060
keep running your mouth.

42:41.214 --> 42:42.491
He asked me *

42:42.588 --> 42:45.111
This is the easiest way *

42:45.686 --> 42:46.672
And I'm like...

42:46.774 --> 42:48.146
Don't fucking *

42:49.533 --> 42:52.671
I heard he was
running with Jack, the ace.

42:52.936 --> 42:55.470
The ace of the haul road.
Come on...

42:55.600 --> 42:59.453
♪ Coldfoot, I found
Jack Jesse sitting in there.

42:59.562 --> 43:01.465
- Yeah.
- All the time.

43:01.723 --> 43:06.408
♪ parking lot with
his name, Jack's spot.

43:07.866 --> 43:10.176
I can talk all day
about those guys.

43:14.632 --> 43:17.195
Next time on
Ice Road Truckers...

43:17.380 --> 43:19.583
45 below 0 here.

43:19.726 --> 43:21.643
Plummeting temperatures...

43:22.260 --> 43:23.750
♪

43:24.145 --> 43:27.277
threaten to shut down
North America's ice roads.

43:27.423 --> 43:29.419
It's getting colder
the norther I go.

43:30.635 --> 43:33.508
Looks like the apocalypse right here.

43:33.622 --> 43:35.059
In the Yukon...

43:35.179 --> 43:38.818
Alex fights to keep
supplies moving up the Dempster.

43:38.921 --> 43:41.181
The road has been closed as
much as has been open.

43:42.092 --> 43:44.166
But in Manitoba, Canada...

43:47.416 --> 43:49.314
temperatures...

43:50.247 --> 43:52.161
and tempers...

43:53.303 --> 43:55.603
are on a season high.
