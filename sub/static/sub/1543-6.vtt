WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:07.042
The lore. Hunters. Men of Letters.
What a load of crap.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.311
I'm a demon.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.217
There's no point in trying
to bring your brother back now.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.150
This isn't even the
real you I'm talking to.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.021
Oh, it's the real me, all right.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.854
Welcome back, Dean.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.613
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.392
- But I need to work.
- If things go sideways...

00:23.590 --> 00:26.002
...like an inch,
you gotta give me the heads-up.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.399
Done.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.232
We got work to do.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.109
What is it? Spirit? Demon? What?

00:33.333 --> 00:36.871
This can't be possible. Dragons, dude.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.175
- We're hunting a jinn.
- A freaking genie?

00:39.373 --> 00:41.114
- Then what are you?
- I'm a pishtaco.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.048
- A fish taco?
- It's not a man-droid.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.383
It's a Shapeshifter. Vampire pirates.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.360
Ham-pirates. Smurfs.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.858
- Fairies.
- Fairies?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.088
Nibbles? Come on.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.922
Bitch.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.227
Tulpas require a ton of psychic energy.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.461
- It's not a tulpa.
- It's Calliope.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.639
I think I know what we're
dealing with here.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.810
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

01:15.943 --> 01:20.153
Now, now. I know it's a terribly sad day.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.624
Bunny Lacroix was a good woman.
A fair employer with a kind heart.

01:27.888 --> 01:32.564
But there is work to be done.
In less than 24 hours...

01:32.759 --> 01:37.230
...the Lacroix family will descend upon this
estate for the funeral and reading of the will.

01:37.431 --> 01:41.675
And it is our duty to make sure
this manor is in tip-top shape.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.111
We owe that much to Bunny.

01:46.406 --> 01:49.615
Colette, to the master closet.

01:49.810 --> 01:53.849
I'd like you to select
Mrs. Lacroix's wardrobe for the burial.

01:54.081 --> 01:58.860
Olivia, please make sure
all the lavatories are spotless.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.157
- Why do I have to...?
- Now, now.

02:01.655 --> 02:05.967
You're still the new hire.
Colette has seniority.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.837
Chop-chop. There's no time to waste.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.870
But you're dead.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.201
What have you done?

04:18.257 --> 04:22.604
Here you go.
Individually brewed. Technology, man.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.333
Real men don't drink out
of cups this small.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.681
- What is that? Cinnamon roll?
- It's glazed donut.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.613
- Look, man. If you don't want it...
- No. I got it.

04:36.343 --> 04:39.415
So any leads on the scanner?
Or the Inter-web?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.786
Nothing. Not even a cat up a tree.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.793
So right when we're ready to
jump back into it, it goes radio silence?

04:45.986 --> 04:48.990
- Murphy's Law.
- Yeah, well, Murphy's a douche.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.191
Feel like taking
a detour to Connecticut?

04:51.424 --> 04:54.803
- What?
- Found it while I was dust busting.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.770
- One of ours?
- It's one of Bobby's.

04:57.597 --> 05:01.135
And in total, 27 messages. The only one
that counts is from two days ago.

05:01.334 --> 05:05.009
Apparently, Bobby's been named
a beneficiary in Bunny Lacroix's will.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.516
- Bunny La-who'?
- Attorney said she's an heiress.

05:08.708 --> 05:12.815
And Bobby's presence, or next of kin,
is being requested in New Canaan.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.117
I figured we qualify.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.451
How did Bobby know an heiress?

05:17.284 --> 05:19.628
Bobby had secrets, man.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.366
Like loving on Tori Spelling.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.059
If he only knew Dean cheated on her.

05:28.795 --> 05:32.538
Anyway, road trip? Who knows?
Maybe Bobby earned us some beer money.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.314
Wow.

05:48.048 --> 05:53.657
You think we're a little underdressed?
I mean, the fed threads are in the trunk.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.324
Are you kidding me?
For once, we don't have to wear suits.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.526
You're lucky my waistbands not elastic.

06:08.401 --> 06:12.713
- May I help you?
- I'm Sam Winchester. This is Dean Winchester.

06:12.906 --> 06:16.877
- We're here on behalf of Bobby Singer.
- Mr. Singer won't be coming?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.852
No, he passed away.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.615
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.255
Condolences for your loss too.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.586
Thank you.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.230
You just missed the funeral.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.026
The family's relaxing inside,
if you'd like to join.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.410
Allow me to introduce
Sam and Dean Winchester.

06:44.404 --> 06:48.216
Sam and Dean Winchester
of the Westchester Winchesters?

06:49.409 --> 06:53.152
- No. No. I don't think there's any relation.
- No.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.723
- Sorry.
- No matter.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.122
You two are...

06:57.484 --> 06:59.464
...adorable.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.955
Oh.

07:02.489 --> 07:05.402
I'm Heddy, Bunny's cousin.
And this is my sister, Beverly.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.128
Charmed, I'm sure.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.501
And that's Bunny's youngest
brother, Stanton-Stan for short.

07:11.731 --> 07:15.178
Come on in, fellas. Join the mourning.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.906
And his child bride, Amber.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.012
- Go, Stan.
- Babe. Don't.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.689
- You're breaking my concentration...
- And there's Dash.

07:25.912 --> 07:30.861
The baby of the family. He's Bunny's
great-nephew. Harvard Business.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.828
How do you guys know Aunt Bunny?

07:34.988 --> 07:38.458
.We..
- We didn't personally know her.

07:38.658 --> 07:42.800
- Our surrogate dad, Bobby Singer, did.
- Yeah.

07:42.996 --> 07:47.604
Bobby? Never heard of him. But you can
fill us in over the weekend, huh?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.449
- The weekend?
- Didn't the attorney tell you?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.016
Service was today.
The reading of the will tomorrow.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.381
But you're welcome to spend the night.
All the rooms sleep two.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.483
Or three.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.491
Okay.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.124
- Where's Colette?
- She quit.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.789
Poor dear was so distraught
over Mrs. Lacroix's passing.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.333
Went off to find herself.

08:11.524 --> 08:14.835
- Ashram in India?
- Clown college in Sarasota.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.234
Good choice.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.903
May I have a word
in the hall in five minutes?

08:19.566 --> 08:21.341
- Sure.
- Yeah.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.211
So, Sam, tell me.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.884
Do you work out?

08:35.815 --> 08:38.489
"Charmed, I'm sure."
What are these people?

08:38.684 --> 08:41.164
- I think they're called WASPs.
- What?

08:41.587 --> 08:46.435
My apologies for being so oblique back
there, but I'm doing you boys a favor.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.195
- Okay.
- As you know...

08:48.395 --> 08:51.399
...Mrs. Lacroix bequeathed
something to a Mr. Singer.

08:51.598 --> 08:55.512
The reading of the will isn't until tomorrow.
I would hate for you to stick around.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.911
And be forced to, well,
mingle with the family.

08:59.105 --> 09:02.416
Don't worry, Alfred.
We know which one the shrimp fork is.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.585
Kind of.

09:05.779 --> 09:09.522
Mr. Winchester, if you're implying
that I don't think you're good enough...

09:09.716 --> 09:12.424
...it's quite the contrary.
You're far too good.

09:13.286 --> 09:17.598
The Lacroix family is, well,
how shall I say this politely?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.567
Money-grubbing leeches.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.700
I thought they were all loaded.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.375
Loaded, yes. Rich? No.

09:24.564 --> 09:28.478
The recession hit every one of them. I'm
afraid if they knew what Bunny left you...

09:29.202 --> 09:33.708
...those vultures would try to stake claim. Since
the attorney kindly agreed to a handoff...

09:33.907 --> 09:37.616
...you don't have to be
subjected to the scrutiny.

09:38.978 --> 09:42.721
Do you have any idea how
Bunny and Bobby knew each other?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.427
Not in the slightest.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.396
If there's nothing else,
shall I have Olivia show you out?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.833
No. No. We got it. Thanks.

10:01.768 --> 10:02.803
Huh.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.447
Kind of fancy to leave
a guy like Bobby.

10:06.806 --> 10:09.150
You thinking what I'm thinking?

10:10.176 --> 10:14.022
If Bunny was banging Bobby,
then maybe these rocks are real.

10:14.647 --> 10:18.322
What do you mean it's not real?
The old bag is rolling in it.

10:18.518 --> 10:23.968
Well, looks like the "old bag" has got a soft
spot for fake rubies and cubic zirconia.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.933
This is interesting though.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.136
It's a key.

10:34.868 --> 10:35.972
A key to what?

10:37.704 --> 10:40.776
There's one way to find out. Ask Jeeves.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.778
- Beverly saw you sexting at dinner.
- Doesn't know what she's talking about.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.515
- I was texting my mom.
- An emoticon of a peeled banana?

10:47.714 --> 10:48.784
She likes fruit.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.188
Just admit it.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.226
- You're cheating.
- And you're drunk.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.864
Not to mention paranoid.

10:56.723 --> 11:01.570
Just like Lance. He was always accusing
poor Bunny of sleeping around.

11:01.794 --> 11:06.174
Because she was.
My sister was a two-bit hooker in Chanel.

11:06.366 --> 11:10.508
How dare you? Your sister's dead.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.721
What are you looking at?

11:24.317 --> 11:26.558
Good riddance to you both.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.322
- Stanton?
- What?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.593
I didn't say anything.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.770
Stanton.

11:37.897 --> 11:40.104
Stanton.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.724
No!

12:28.881 --> 12:30.087
Everything okay?

12:31.150 --> 12:32.652
Not really.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.260
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

12:43.630 --> 12:48.409
I presume you left something behind.
I'll check the front closet for burlap.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.810
I got news for you, Mr. Belvedere.
The jackets canvas.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.576
Uh, you two were here earlier?

12:55.475 --> 12:56.749
Yeah. Who wants to know?

12:58.978 --> 13:01.322
Detective Howard. New Canaan P.D.

13:01.514 --> 13:05.758
Congratulations, boys.
You're now officially murder suspects.

13:06.819 --> 13:08.093
I'm sorry. What?

13:08.288 --> 13:12.668
Bunny Lacroix's brother, Stanton, was killed
this evening. His body's gone to the morgue.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.497
- And you think...
- I don't know.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.665
You two and anyone else who
stepped foot in this house today...

13:18.865 --> 13:21.106
...is being detained for questioning.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.774
Beverly, let go of me.
It's so obvious she's guilty.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.113
- You're off your rocker, old lady.
- Old lady? I...

13:30.877 --> 13:32.857
Ha, ha. I'm 39.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.321
And you have been since '03.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.158
How dare you?

13:38.351 --> 13:41.332
I'm sorry to interrupt, but who's guilty?

13:41.521 --> 13:46.698
- The town slut, Amber. She killed Stan.
- And what's her motive, Murder, She Wrote?

13:46.893 --> 13:49.533
Everyone knows that
Amber was sleeping around.

13:49.729 --> 13:53.700
She wanted to leave Stan, but her pre-nup
was ironclad so she killed him.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.504
Sounds logical.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.808
Unless you believe that
ridiculous story that she's been peddling.

13:59.005 --> 14:03.147
- A ghost killed Stanton. Honestly.
- A ghost?

14:03.343 --> 14:06.756
She's claiming that Bunny's
late husband, Lance, did it.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.823
Have you ever heard of such a thing?
What a panic.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.326
You're nutty on those synthetic hormones.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.432
How appalling.
Don't they teach you manners at Harvard?

14:16.656 --> 14:19.159
Looks like we might have a case here.
Vengeful spirit?

14:19.359 --> 14:22.067
Yeah. Think we can get to the car?
Get the EMF?

14:22.261 --> 14:26.767
Not with Detective Friendly. Not a chance.
Guess we're gonna have to go old-school.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.036
Cold spots it is. You stay here...

14:29.235 --> 14:32.444
...keep an eye on Miss Peacock and
Colonel Mustard. I'll sniff around.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.552
For your information,
I already own a big, beautiful yacht.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.917
- Is that what you call that thing?
- Fine. It's a mahogany sunfish.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.776
Hey.

15:05.972 --> 15:11.422
Gotta say, for a family that just
lost two members, you all seem fine.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.389
Well, Sam.

15:14.580 --> 15:19.757
I'll let you in on a little family secret.
We don't really like each other.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.400
Then again, what family does?

15:25.992 --> 15:27.665
Mine does.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.570
For the most part.
It's just my brother and me. So...

15:33.466 --> 15:35.241
Then you're lucky.

15:35.635 --> 15:39.481
Trust me, it's a miracle we've been under
the same roof for 24 hours and haven't...

15:41.140 --> 15:42.312
Oops.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.785
My bad.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.019
And, uh, why are you so sure
Amber didn't do it?

15:50.249 --> 15:52.456
Because Amber's not a killer.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.600
She has trouble using Wi-Fi. I don't
exactly think she's capable of murder.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.681
And her story about the ghost?

16:54.747 --> 16:56.385
I don't believe in ghosts.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.995
That said, if anyone would
come back to haunt, it's Uncle Lance.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.565
Heard he was a real bastard.
No one really mourned his death.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.498
Except Aunt Bunny,
who became a recluse after he died.

17:06.925 --> 17:12.239
So maybe the old goat has
a chip on his shoulder? Who the hell knows?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.541
Dash.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.339
You're up.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.626
- Dean?
- Olivia?

18:45.191 --> 18:48.434
- Thank God. I thought you were him.
- Him who?

18:48.928 --> 18:50.532
Phillip, the butler.

18:51.631 --> 18:56.011
He locked me in here because I wouldn't
lie to the detective about what I saw.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.977
What did you see?

18:59.038 --> 19:03.453
- I saw him roll Colette's body in a rug.
- Clown college Colette?

19:03.643 --> 19:06.817
- The butler killed her?
- No. No. He just hid her.

19:07.713 --> 19:08.783
But who killed hen'?

19:10.783 --> 19:14.390
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but I saw it with my own eyes.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.294
Let me guess. Lance's ghost.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.869
No. Bunny's.

19:33.572 --> 19:35.745
Excuse me.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.658
- Hey. What's up?
- You see the butler?

19:41.547 --> 19:44.050
- No. Why?
- Because if anybody has answers, it's him.

19:44.684 --> 19:48.496
Two vengeful spirits. Apparently,
Aunt Bunny had a bee in her bonnet as well.

19:49.922 --> 19:54.894
- Husband and wife tag team killer ghosts?
- Well, gotta keep the marriage alive somehow.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.904
The key is to a hidden attic.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.600
Why would Bunny want
Bobby to have a key to her attic?

20:00.833 --> 20:04.872
It gets weirder.
I found Olivia and Colette locked inside.

20:05.504 --> 20:09.077
- Clown college Colette?
- She ain't studying balloon animals. She's dead.

20:10.409 --> 20:14.755
- What's the butler have to do with all this?
- He's the one who locked them in there.

20:14.947 --> 20:20.192
Now, I don't know why, but he's covering for
the spooks. He's acting like their Renfield.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.594
All right. We gotta find him.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.599
- I'll take upstairs. You take here.
- All right.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.303
Sam Winchester?

20:36.936 --> 20:39.439
Where did you run off to?

20:43.709 --> 20:48.089
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

20:48.280 --> 20:51.454
What you doing
snooping around these halls?

20:51.984 --> 20:55.989
Up to no good?
Why don't we get up to no good together?

20:56.455 --> 20:59.299
You know, they say women
just get better with age.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.336
Like a fine wine. Or cheese.

21:02.895 --> 21:07.401
- I'm lactose intolerant.
- Oh, come on, Sammy.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.605
Don't be coy. We have got a good
10 minutes before my interrogation.

21:11.804 --> 21:16.446
And I bet a young buck like you
can do a lot in 10 minutes.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.286
I'm right behind you.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.959
Right behind me. Oh, God.

21:25.584 --> 21:29.828
Could you just give me a hand with this
zipper? I always have such a hard time...

22:20.472 --> 22:22.577
Leaky faucet's down the hall.

22:25.911 --> 22:31.486
Cut the crap, Wadsworth. What are you doing
hiding dead maids in secret rooms?

22:31.884 --> 22:35.923
I know it all looks rather peculiar,
but I can explain.

23:09.788 --> 23:14.294
So you hid Colette's body in the attic
so she wouldn't steal Bunny's thunder?

23:14.526 --> 23:18.702
I couldn't stand the thought of overshadowing
Mrs. Lacroix's funeral with another death.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.471
She deserved a proper farewell.
I owed it to her.

23:23.435 --> 23:26.143
- Well, that's crazy.
- No, Mr. Winchester.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.579
That's loyalty.

24:14.687 --> 24:19.193
- Dean. Yeah? What?
- Sam, it's no ghost. It's a Shapeshifter.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.448
The Shifter's getting its jollies
by impersonating dead people.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.641
Yeah. First Bunny, then Lance, now Phillip.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.343
Guess we can rule out "the butler did it."

24:38.444 --> 24:41.323
The creep just shed.
Now it could be anybody.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.789
- Even you.
- Or you. We need to find some silver.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.827
- Ah! Oh, my God!
- Hey.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.726
He was like that when we found him.

24:50.289 --> 24:53.896
- Who did this?
- We don't know yet, okay? Now listen.

24:54.126 --> 25:00.077
I know you think he was working with ghosts,
but there's something worse going on here.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.204
Worse than...

25:03.068 --> 25:07.676
- What is going on?
- If you want to help, help. Can you do that?

25:10.075 --> 25:12.851
- Why do you need the silverware?
- For protection.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.654
- Butter knives?
- Trust us. There's a method to our madness.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.421
You wanna hold this?

25:25.257 --> 25:26.759
Dean?

25:31.263 --> 25:34.176
All right. Let's do this.

25:36.101 --> 25:40.675
No. No. No.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.286
- No.
- Wait. Wait. Go back. He owned an island.

25:45.411 --> 25:46.788
And a harelip.

25:47.012 --> 25:49.390
Who cares, if you're drinking
mai tais in the lap of luxury?

25:49.581 --> 25:51.527
Ahem. Hey. Hey, ladies.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.095
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

25:54.286 --> 25:56.266
Trying to find Beverly a man.

25:56.889 --> 26:01.099
I've resorted to fishing online
because the live ones won't bite.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.600
You mean back there?
I was just playing hard to get.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.139
Well, then.

26:07.933 --> 26:09.913
You're a very convincing actor.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.142
Come.

26:13.539 --> 26:16.145
Sure. All right.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.616
Scoot over. Yes.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.652
So...

26:24.450 --> 26:26.953
Boo, I'm feeling so left out.

26:27.152 --> 26:31.430
Well, then, come on in, darling.
The water's warm.

27:06.258 --> 27:09.364
- Really?
- We can explain.

27:09.595 --> 27:12.098
Let me guess.
You two got bored last Christmas.

27:12.831 --> 27:15.471
New Canaan clambake, actually.

27:16.468 --> 27:20.541
We were in line at the buffet. They ran out
of steamers. One thing lead to another...

27:20.772 --> 27:25.380
- But we didn't kill Stanton.
- We may be guilty of cheating, but not murder.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.190
- Touch these.
- What? Why?

27:30.382 --> 27:32.555
Do it or I go cards up
on your whole clambake.

27:42.227 --> 27:45.333
- Did we pass?
- Yup.

27:45.531 --> 27:48.375
Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.

27:48.634 --> 27:49.840
Come on, you two.

27:50.035 --> 27:52.641
- Did you see how long his fingers were?
- Theyr're just...

27:52.838 --> 27:55.876
I'm very fascinated. First of all,
did you see? Look how long...

27:56.074 --> 27:59.647
- Should I come back when you're done?
- He's calling for me. Sorry.

27:59.845 --> 28:03.383
And it's all going to hell.
Right here. Right now.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.058
Sorry to interrupt.

28:11.223 --> 28:15.569
- Grey Gardens cleared.
- So is Dash and Amber. They're a thing.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.206
Yeah. WASPs.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.933
So that's everyone.

28:20.165 --> 28:21.906
- Except for...
- Aah!

28:28.774 --> 28:29.912
Well, we got a floater.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.749
Great.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.889
- He's a goner.
- Drowned in a toilet. How filthy.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.466
What kind of monster
would do such a thing?

28:46.758 --> 28:48.897
Don't look at me. I was just trying to pee.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.904
Okay. Hold on.
Before we start pointing fingers...

28:52.097 --> 28:55.044
Amber has motive. She killed the
detective because she knew...

28:55.234 --> 28:58.272
...it was a matter of time
before he figured out she killed Stan.

29:00.472 --> 29:04.614
Bravo, Rizzoli. You solved the case.
You wanna weigh in too, Isles?

29:04.810 --> 29:08.053
I didn't kill Stanton
or the detective and I have proof.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.126
- Guys...
- My alibi is in this room.

29:11.984 --> 29:15.295
- Wait for it.
- Amber couldn't have killed. She was with me.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.063
- We're in love.
- We're sleeping together.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.001
- I knew it.
- Then you have motive too.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.902
You offed Stan because
you were diddling his wife.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.669
The old lady doth protest too much.

29:28.900 --> 29:32.973
You're pointing the finger to distract from
your guilt. You probably got Jane to help.

29:33.171 --> 29:36.084
Ah! Well, I never-I'm leaving.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.690
All right. Hey. First of all, who talks like
that? Second of all, no one's leaving, okay?

29:40.912 --> 29:44.291
- Oh, get your hands off me, young man.
- Okay. See, I don't trust anyone.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.929
And leaving just makes you look guilty.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.999
- Dean is right. We have four corpses now.
- Four corpses?

29:51.189 --> 29:54.966
- You can add Phillip and Colette to the list.
- Clown college Colette?

29:55.160 --> 29:57.800
- But I thought she...
- She's dead, all right? She's dead.

29:57.996 --> 30:02.001
We can't help you unless you stop arguing
with one another. You need to trust us.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.804
Trust you?

30:04.803 --> 30:06.783
We don't even know you.

30:07.839 --> 30:12.481
Look, buddy. I'm trying to be objective here.
We've had countless family functions before.

30:12.678 --> 30:16.216
And even though we wanted
to kill one another, we never did.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.963
Dash is right.
Our get-togethers never end in murder.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.530
The only thing different
this time around is you.

30:22.721 --> 30:25.634
Okay, first of all,
whatever you're suggesting...

30:25.824 --> 30:27.303
You two.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.033
Let's go.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.869
Don't even think about it.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.375
I hunt pheasant.

30:47.412 --> 30:49.187
Sit tight until the cops get here.

30:49.381 --> 30:53.523
You don't wanna do this. We're your
best shot at making it out of here alive.

30:53.719 --> 30:55.164
We're not the bad guys, Dash.

30:55.921 --> 30:57.901
I beg to differ.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.396
You're wearing flannel.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.903
Hey...

31:15.207 --> 31:16.686
Hey.

31:17.275 --> 31:20.085
- Keys.
- No. It's locked from the outside.

31:20.278 --> 31:21.916
Are you kidding me?

31:22.114 --> 31:23.457
Great.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.690
What the...?

31:29.788 --> 31:32.564
Made in Taiwan.
Fricking stainless steel.

31:32.758 --> 31:35.136
That's why no one sizzled?
They're not real silver?

31:36.862 --> 31:40.036
First some cubic zirconium.
And now this.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.611
No wonder the rich stay rich.
How are we gonna kill this thing?

31:44.603 --> 31:48.312
- We got silver bullets in the trunk.
- Assuming we ever make it out of here.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.986
I don't get it.
Why would Sam and Dean want us dead?

31:51.209 --> 31:55.715
Isn't it obvious?
They wanted our inheritance.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.087
Whatever Aunt Bunny left
them wasn't enough.

31:58.283 --> 32:01.628
For the love of God, Dash.
Put down the gun before you kill someone.

32:01.820 --> 32:05.996
- It's okay. I hunt pheasants.
- Put it down.

32:11.329 --> 32:15.505
I knew those boys were trailer trash the
moment they rolled up in that American-made.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.407
Not to mention homosexuals.

32:17.969 --> 32:21.348
Homosexual murderers.
Like Leopold and Loeb.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.280
Only hotter.

32:25.510 --> 32:28.684
- Call the police at once.
- Oh, I don'! think so.

32:30.282 --> 32:36.961
Heh, heh. Excuse me, young lady? Killer
or no killer, you're still on the clock.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.262
You idiots couldn't be more wrong.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.829
About everything.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.770
Don't you know?
If it's not the butler, it's the maid.

32:57.509 --> 32:58.613
Dean.

32:59.444 --> 33:00.718
You gotta see this.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.323
We got played by the maid.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.164
Both doors are reinforced.

33:20.131 --> 33:24.204
- I'm not the maid.
- Well, that explains the dust.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.313
I'm Bunny's daughter.

33:29.307 --> 33:33.653
- What? Bunny didn't have a child.
- Oh, yes, she did. A very devoted one.

33:37.215 --> 33:42.597
I loved Mother more than anything. Which
is more than I can say for any of you.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.165
Then where have you
been hiding all these years?

33:45.824 --> 33:47.201
The attic.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.195
Like in the movie?

33:50.662 --> 33:52.039
Oh, Amber.

33:58.336 --> 34:00.748
Phillip was the only one
at the manor who knew.

34:01.206 --> 34:04.278
So after she died,
he took pity on me, and he let me out.

34:04.910 --> 34:08.551
He told me to pose as the new maid
so I could hide in plain sight.

34:08.746 --> 34:12.126
That's why you killed Colette? For her job?

34:12.551 --> 34:14.462
No. No. No. Colette was just an accident.

34:14.686 --> 34:17.292
I wanted to scare her,
because I caught her stealing.

34:17.522 --> 34:22.301
Well, that doesn't explain wanting us dead.
None of us are thieves.

34:22.694 --> 34:27.234
Oh, no. You're worse.
Your greed. Your disdain.

34:27.431 --> 34:30.743
Your blatant disrespect for Mother.
You all had it coming.

34:30.936 --> 34:34.474
But why kill Phillip?
I mean, if he was on your side...

34:34.906 --> 34:39.217
Because he turned on me.
After Stanton, he locked me back up.

34:41.478 --> 34:44.255
Lucky for me,
the cute, dumb one let me out.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.431
- Gun safe.
- Hey.

34:49.621 --> 34:50.929
Try these.

34:51.121 --> 34:54.331
No wonder you were locked away.
You're a monster.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.232
Oh, you have no idea.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.808
- What in God's name...?
- Shut up.

35:25.023 --> 35:26.297
Stay here.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.173
Did anyone else wet themselves?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.388
You don't have a clear shot.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.121
Neither do you.

35:52.183 --> 35:55.858
Killing you is the next
best thing to killing Bobby Singer.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.901
What's your beef with Bobby?

36:05.130 --> 36:08.577
For starters, he killed my father.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.540
- Lance was a Shifter?
- Lance wasn't my father.

36:15.073 --> 36:18.350
Mother had an affair with a Shifter.
She got pregnant.

36:19.344 --> 36:24.885
Told Lance I was his. He bought it, until
she brought me back from the hospital.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.424
My real dad was waiting.

36:27.652 --> 36:30.394
Lance put up a fight,
but he was no match for a Shifter.

36:31.856 --> 36:35.360
And just as my dad was about to take me...

36:37.028 --> 36:41.374
...the hunter became the hunted.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.004
Bobby.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.776
After Bobby killed my father,
he came after me.

36:50.542 --> 36:56.584
Mother pleaded with him to spare me.
He agreed under one condition.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.918
That she keep you locked up.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.624
For my safety and the safety of others.

37:04.622 --> 37:10.436
Mother told the family she lost the baby,
and she locked me in the attic.

37:10.862 --> 37:14.639
But she remained devoted
to me until the very end.

37:14.866 --> 37:19.645
Even got Bobby to promise to take care
of me if anything happened to her.

37:19.871 --> 37:23.409
Wait a minute.
Bobby spared you. You should be grateful.

37:23.608 --> 37:28.079
For what?
Keeping me locked up my whole life?

37:30.448 --> 37:32.724
It would've been kinder to kill me.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.495
Olivia.

37:37.822 --> 37:39.893
You don't have to do this.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.931
Being a monster is a choice.

37:43.561 --> 37:46.440
That choice was made
for me a long time ago.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.838
Why haven't you taken a shot?

37:57.008 --> 37:58.078
Oh.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.159
You don't have any silver bullets, do you?

38:24.636 --> 38:25.979
Yes, officer.

38:26.171 --> 38:28.515
Yes, thank you very much.

38:29.007 --> 38:32.352
Yes, no, you can't miss it.
Big house on the end of the street.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.854
All right. Bye now.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.558
Guys.

38:38.683 --> 38:40.458
Police are on their way.

38:40.785 --> 38:42.628
What a mess.

38:45.190 --> 38:48.137
- I owe you two an apology.
- Don't sweat it.

38:48.326 --> 38:54.868
I mean, you were just protecting your family.
And there is nothing wrong with that.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.871
So I spoke to Aunt Bunny's attorney.

38:58.136 --> 39:02.676
He said, outside from the pendant,
everything's left to Olivia.

39:04.209 --> 39:07.486
You know what? Speaking of that.

39:10.815 --> 39:14.729
You guys should keep it.
It's a key to the attic.

39:17.222 --> 39:22.001
Bobby must have really meant something
to Aunt Bunny. How can we repay you?

39:22.393 --> 39:24.066
You know what?

39:25.230 --> 39:26.834
Just forget we were ever here.

39:27.565 --> 39:30.045
You saved our lives.
I want everyone to know heroes...

39:30.235 --> 39:34.615
Look, pal. The fact that we pulled your
bacon out of the fire is nobody's business.

39:34.839 --> 39:35.909
Okay?

39:37.375 --> 39:40.413
Hey. I'm serious, IZOD.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.086
Put a pin in it.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.919
Or we'll come back for your preppy ass.

40:21.286 --> 40:24.130
Dean, what was that all about back there?

40:26.391 --> 40:28.393
What are you talking about?

40:30.061 --> 40:32.439
I mean, all those...

40:32.630 --> 40:36.772
...extra shots after the Shifter
was already dead. What was that?

40:36.968 --> 40:40.939
- I don't know. Target practice?
- Come on, man. I'm serious.

40:44.309 --> 40:46.289
You sure it wasn't...

40:46.477 --> 40:49.822
...I don't know, demon residue?
Or something to do with the mark? Or...?

40:50.081 --> 40:52.823
No. No. None of that.

40:53.418 --> 40:54.829
Right.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.996
Man, I gotta be honest...

41:00.191 --> 41:04.162
Oh, my God, Sam.
It was my first kill since I've been back.

41:04.362 --> 41:08.469
I got a little anxious. I wanted to make
sure it was done right. Plain and simple.

41:13.338 --> 41:15.818
Why am I even explaining this to you?

41:20.211 --> 41:21.315
Dean, I...

41:22.113 --> 41:24.115
I see their faces

41:24.315 --> 41:29.025
I feel the traces they've left on my soul

41:30.989 --> 41:36.302
Those are the memories
That make me a wealthy soul

41:39.297 --> 41:46.215
Those are the memories
That make me a wealthy soul
