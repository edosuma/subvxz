00:19.801 --> 00:21.711
Approaching Omicron Ceti III, sir.

00:21.887 --> 00:23.298
Standard orbit, Mr. Painter.

00:23.472 --> 00:25.050
Yes, sir.

00:26.475 --> 00:28.634
- Captain?
- Yes, lieutenant.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.471
I've been transmitting
a contact signal

00:30.647 --> 00:32.390
every five minutes
as ordered, sir.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.392
All I get is dead air.
Shall I continue?

00:34.567 --> 00:37.688
Maintain transmission pattern
until we've established orbit.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.939
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Mr. Spock,

00:40.115 --> 00:43.567
there were 150 men, women
and children in that colony.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.404
What are the chances
of survivors?

00:45.579 --> 00:46.825
Absolutely none, captain.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.572
Berthold rays are such
a recent discovery.

00:49.751 --> 00:52.705
We do not yet have
full knowledge of their nature.

00:52.879 --> 00:54.872
It is known, however,
that living animal tissue

00:55.048 --> 00:56.673
disintegrates under exposure.

00:56.842 --> 00:59.759
Sandoval's group could not
have survived after three years.

00:59.928 --> 01:01.921
You're saying that those people

01:02.097 --> 01:05.217
built a future in a place
knowing they might not survive.

01:05.393 --> 01:07.931
I'm saying they knew
there was a risk.

01:08.396 --> 01:10.389
What about us? Can we afford
to send people down

01:10.565 --> 01:11.596
to the planet surface?

01:11.775 --> 01:14.444
The breakdown of tissue
does not develop immediately.

01:14.611 --> 01:16.604
We can risk a limited exposure.

01:16.780 --> 01:19.781
We've established orbit, sir.
And I've pinpointed a settlement.

01:20.367 --> 01:22.443
Thank you, Mr. Painter.

01:23.287 --> 01:24.663
Mr. Spock.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.989
Equip a landing party of five
to accompany me

01:27.166 --> 01:31.378
to the planet surface.
Include Dr. McCoy and a biologist.

01:31.546 --> 01:33.124
I'll want them in ten minutes.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.177
Another dream that failed.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.808
There's nothing sadder.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.515
It took these people a year
to make the trip from Earth.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.514
They came all that way...

02:27.273 --> 02:29.646
...and died.
- Hardly that, sir.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.820
Welcome to Omicron Ceti III.

02:39.662 --> 02:41.868
I am Elias Sandoval.

02:50.340 --> 02:53.875
Space, the final frontier.

02:54.678 --> 02:58.213
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:58.391 --> 03:03.183
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:03.354 --> 03:07.222
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

03:07.484 --> 03:10.651
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:42.522 --> 03:46.271
Captain's log, stardate 3417.3.

03:46.443 --> 03:48.899
We thought our mission
to Omicron Ceti III

03:49.071 --> 03:50.613
would be an unhappy one.

03:50.781 --> 03:54.861
We had expected to find no survivors
of the agricultural colony there.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.156
Apparently, our information
was incorrect.

03:58.331 --> 04:00.786
We haven't seen anyone outside
our own group for four years,

04:00.959 --> 04:02.204
since we left the Earth.

04:02.377 --> 04:04.334
We've been expecting
someone for some time.

04:04.504 --> 04:06.164
Our subspace radio
didn't work properly.

04:06.339 --> 04:07.834
I'm afraid we didn't have
anyone here

04:08.008 --> 04:09.502
who could master its intricacies.

04:09.843 --> 04:12.631
Actually, Mr. Sandoval,

04:12.805 --> 04:15.474
we didn't come here
because of your silent radio.

04:15.641 --> 04:19.473
It makes little difference, captain.
You're here. We're happy to see you.

04:19.646 --> 04:22.137
Come, let me show you
our settlement.

04:23.817 --> 04:26.308
On pure speculation,
just an educated guess,

04:26.486 --> 04:28.728
I'd say that man is alive.

04:28.906 --> 04:32.607
Captain, this planet is being
bombarded by Berthold rays,

04:32.785 --> 04:34.493
as our reports indicated.

04:34.662 --> 04:38.446
At this intensity, we'll be safe
for a week, if necessary.

04:38.625 --> 04:39.953
But...

04:40.585 --> 04:43.337
But these people shouldn't be alive.

04:43.630 --> 04:45.919
Is it possible that they're not?

04:46.842 --> 04:49.926
You shook hands with him, Jim.
His flesh was warm. He's alive.

04:50.095 --> 04:51.376
There's no doubt about that.

04:51.555 --> 04:53.133
There is also no question on the fact

04:53.307 --> 04:55.763
that Berthold rays
are incontrovertibly deadly.

04:55.935 --> 04:58.391
There's no miracle connected with it,
doctor. You know that.

04:58.563 --> 05:00.520
No cures, no serums, no antidotes.

05:00.690 --> 05:04.225
If a man is exposed
long enough, he dies.

05:04.403 --> 05:07.653
Gentlemen, we're debating
in a vacuum.

05:07.823 --> 05:09.697
Let's go get some answers.

05:29.305 --> 05:32.389
There are two other settlements,
but we have 45 colonists here.

05:32.558 --> 05:34.052
What was the reason
for the dispersal?

05:34.227 --> 05:35.602
Well, we felt that three groups

05:35.770 --> 05:37.312
would have a better chance
for growth.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.975
If disease were to
strike one group,

05:39.149 --> 05:41.474
then the others would be less likely
to be affected.

05:41.651 --> 05:45.186
You see, Omicron
is an ideal agricultural planet.

05:45.364 --> 05:47.155
We determined not to suffer

05:47.324 --> 05:49.732
the fate of expeditions
that went before us.

05:49.910 --> 05:51.737
Elias.

06:00.839 --> 06:03.247
Leila, come meet our guests.

06:03.425 --> 06:05.548
This is Leila Kalomi, our botanist.

06:05.719 --> 06:08.923
This is Captain Kirk,
Dr. McCoy, Mr. Spock.

06:10.725 --> 06:13.132
Mr. Spock and I have met before.

06:16.272 --> 06:18.312
It's been a long time.

06:26.617 --> 06:29.025
Mr. Sandoval, we do have
a mission here.

06:29.203 --> 06:31.955
- Examinations. Tests.
- By all means, make them.

06:32.123 --> 06:35.290
I think you'll find our settlement
an interesting one.

06:35.460 --> 06:36.788
Our philosophy is a simple one:

06:36.962 --> 06:39.583
That men should return
to a less complicated life.

06:39.756 --> 06:41.500
We have few mechanical
things here.

06:41.675 --> 06:43.964
No vehicles, no weapons.

06:44.136 --> 06:47.837
We have harmony here.
Complete peace.

06:48.015 --> 06:49.973
We'll try not to interfere
with your work.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.468
Make yourselves at home,
gentlemen.

07:07.912 --> 07:11.447
What exactly
are we looking for anyway, sir?

07:12.208 --> 07:16.669
Whatever doesn't look right.
Whatever that is.

07:17.047 --> 07:18.422
When it comes to farms,

07:18.590 --> 07:20.250
I wouldn't know what looked
right or wrong

07:20.425 --> 07:22.252
if it were 2 feet from me.

07:29.185 --> 07:30.679
Hey.

07:31.688 --> 07:33.016
What is it?

07:34.357 --> 07:35.982
No cows.

07:36.151 --> 07:39.816
This barn isn't even built
for them, just for storage.

07:39.988 --> 07:41.815
Come to think of it,

07:41.991 --> 07:43.366
we haven't seen any animals.

07:43.534 --> 07:47.532
No horses, no pigs. Not even a dog.

07:47.705 --> 07:48.868
Nothing.

07:49.666 --> 07:51.539
You've known the Vulcanian.

07:51.709 --> 07:54.711
On Earth. Six years ago.

07:55.005 --> 07:56.464
Did you love him?

07:56.631 --> 08:00.048
If I did, it was important
only to myself.

08:00.219 --> 08:01.547
How did he feel?

08:02.471 --> 08:05.425
Mr. Spock's feelings
were never expressed to me.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.055
It is said he has none to give.

08:10.563 --> 08:14.264
Would you like him to stay
with us now? To be as one of us?

08:15.652 --> 08:17.728
There is no choice, Elias.

08:17.905 --> 08:20.063
He will stay.

08:31.586 --> 08:34.256
That will be all.
Thank you very much.

08:39.135 --> 08:40.417
Anything?

08:40.596 --> 08:44.096
I've examined nine men so far,
varying in ages from 23 to 59.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.972
They're all in perfect condition.
Textbook responses.

08:47.145 --> 08:49.184
Heart, lungs, excellent.

08:49.355 --> 08:51.265
Coordination, excellent.

08:51.441 --> 08:53.019
Reflexes, excellent.

08:53.193 --> 08:55.767
If there were many more of them,
I could throw away my shingle.

08:57.281 --> 09:00.068
- Kirk here.
- Spock here, captain.

09:00.242 --> 09:02.568
There seems to be a total
absence of life on the planet.

09:02.745 --> 09:04.654
With the exception
of the colonists themselves

09:04.831 --> 09:06.705
and various types of flora.

09:06.875 --> 09:09.626
Sulu had the same observation.
Any explanations?

09:09.794 --> 09:11.170
Not at the moment, sir.

09:11.338 --> 09:13.377
I'm conducting various tests
with the tricorder,

09:13.548 --> 09:15.506
but results are inconclusive.

09:15.717 --> 09:19.217
Very well. Continue investigations.
Kirk out.

09:20.389 --> 09:22.548
No animals. That's peculiar.

09:22.725 --> 09:24.303
Yes, especially in view of the fact

09:24.477 --> 09:27.264
that the records of this expedition
indicate that they did have some

09:27.439 --> 09:29.515
for breeding and food purposes.

09:29.858 --> 09:31.649
Apparently, none of them survived.

09:31.818 --> 09:34.025
I'd like to see the medical records
on the expedition.

09:34.196 --> 09:36.105
Yes, I thought you might.

09:36.490 --> 09:38.483
Captain, I've been looking for you.

09:38.659 --> 09:40.319
You haven't seen
our fields and crops.

09:40.494 --> 09:43.164
I'd like to show you and the doctor
what we've accomplished here.

09:43.331 --> 09:44.742
I'm afraid I'll have to bow out.

09:44.916 --> 09:48.119
I have to continue
with these medical examinations.

09:48.545 --> 09:51.463
However, if I find
everyone else's health

09:51.632 --> 09:54.170
to be as perfect as yours, I...

09:54.343 --> 09:56.217
He promised to throw away
his shingle.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.260
Well, you'll find no weaklings here.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.677
Captain?

10:01.058 --> 10:03.217
This is the reason, captain.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.850
This soil will grow
anything we plant in it.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.434
It's a perfect world.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.435
We have a moderate climate.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.853
Moderate rains all year round.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.773
It gives us all we need.

10:14.949 --> 10:17.570
- It is perfect.
- Pardon me, captain.

10:17.952 --> 10:19.861
Biology report ready, sir.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.157
Well, I have work to tend to myself,
captain.

10:24.167 --> 10:26.041
Go ahead, lieutenant.

10:26.253 --> 10:28.625
I heard Sandoval saying
they could grow anything here.

10:28.797 --> 10:33.044
That's true, sir. They've got a variety
of crops in. Grains, potatoes, beans.

10:33.218 --> 10:36.504
- Make your point.
- Well, sir, for an agricultural colony,

10:36.681 --> 10:39.053
they actually have
very little acreage planted.

10:39.308 --> 10:42.428
There's enough to sustain the colony,
but very little more.

10:43.563 --> 10:45.639
It's like a jigsaw puzzle, all one colour.

10:45.815 --> 10:48.354
No key to where the pieces fit in.

10:48.527 --> 10:50.021
Why?

10:52.031 --> 10:53.691
- Kirk here.
- This is McCoy, Jim.

10:53.866 --> 10:55.740
- I think you better get back here.
- Trouble?

10:55.910 --> 10:58.401
No, but I'd like you to see this
for yourself.

10:58.579 --> 11:00.157
On my way.

11:03.460 --> 11:04.622
Sandoval's medical record

11:04.794 --> 11:07.083
four years ago, when
the expedition left Earth.

11:07.255 --> 11:08.916
He registered scar tissue
on his lungs

11:09.091 --> 11:11.582
from lobar pneumonia
suffered when he was a child.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.509
No major operations,
but there was an appendectomy.

11:15.681 --> 11:18.173
Received all required inoculations,
et cetera.

11:18.351 --> 11:19.596
What's so strange about that?

11:20.144 --> 11:21.639
Nothing.

11:21.813 --> 11:24.020
But I examined that man
not more than two hours ago.

11:24.191 --> 11:26.349
And you know what
his readings were?

11:26.902 --> 11:28.610
Perfect, perfect and perfect.

11:28.779 --> 11:30.606
Just like everyone else
I've examined here.

11:30.781 --> 11:32.156
Instrument malfunction?

11:32.324 --> 11:34.780
No, I thought of that,
and I tested it on myself.

11:34.952 --> 11:37.278
It accurately recorded
my lack of tonsils

11:37.455 --> 11:39.744
and those two broken ribs
I had once.

11:39.916 --> 11:43.534
It did not record the scar tissue
on Sandoval's lungs.

11:43.712 --> 11:45.788
But it did record a healthy appendix

11:45.964 --> 11:48.669
where one was supposedly removed.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.600
Nothing. Not even insects.

12:00.522 --> 12:03.938
Yet your plants grow, and you've
survived exposure to Berthold rays.

12:04.109 --> 12:06.185
That can be explained.

12:07.654 --> 12:10.490
- Please do.
- Later.

12:12.118 --> 12:13.861
I've never understood
the female capacity

12:14.036 --> 12:16.610
to avoid a direct answer
to any question.

12:17.123 --> 12:20.160
And I never understood you.

12:20.335 --> 12:21.663
Until now.

12:22.546 --> 12:26.045
There was always a place in here
where no one could come.

12:26.216 --> 12:28.968
There was only the face
you allow people to see.

12:29.470 --> 12:32.673
Only one side
you'd allow them to know.

12:40.148 --> 12:41.726
I would like to know
how your people

12:41.900 --> 12:43.560
have managed to survive here.

12:44.194 --> 12:45.653
I missed you.

12:45.821 --> 12:48.229
Logically, you should all be dead.

12:49.033 --> 12:51.322
If I tell you how we survived,

12:51.494 --> 12:54.945
will you try to understand
how we feel about our life here?

12:55.123 --> 12:56.498
About each other?

12:58.460 --> 13:01.295
Emotions are alien to me,
I'm a scientist.

13:01.463 --> 13:02.874
Someone else might
believe that.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.838
Your shipmates, your captain.

13:06.010 --> 13:07.919
But not me.

13:08.554 --> 13:09.835
Come.

13:30.203 --> 13:31.780
Mr. Sandoval, within the hour,

13:31.954 --> 13:33.698
I've received orders
from Starfleet Command

13:33.873 --> 13:35.665
to evacuate all personnel
from this colony.

13:35.834 --> 13:38.918
Naturally, you'll inform your people
to begin preparations.

13:39.087 --> 13:42.539
We will have accommodations
for you aboard the Enterprise.

13:42.716 --> 13:43.795
No.

13:47.888 --> 13:50.806
It's not an arbitrary decision
on my part, sir.

13:50.975 --> 13:52.256
I have my orders.

13:54.646 --> 13:56.437
Captain, it's entirely unnecessary.

13:56.606 --> 13:58.101
We're in no danger here.

13:58.442 --> 14:01.692
We've explained the Berthold rays
to you, and their effect.

14:01.862 --> 14:03.404
Can't you understand?

14:04.114 --> 14:07.614
Doctor, how can I
make you understand?

14:07.785 --> 14:10.490
Your own instruments have shown
that we're all in perfect health.

14:10.663 --> 14:12.573
We've had no deaths here.

14:12.791 --> 14:15.708
- What about your animals?
- We're vegetarians.

14:16.169 --> 14:18.458
That doesn't answer
my question, sir.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.504
Why did all your animals die?

14:21.800 --> 14:25.170
Captain, you stress
very unimportant matters.

14:29.684 --> 14:31.641
We will not leave.

14:41.488 --> 14:43.730
It's not much further.

14:43.908 --> 14:45.984
You've not yet explained
the nature of this thing.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.411
Its basic properties and elements
are not important.

14:49.581 --> 14:54.706
What is important is
it gives life, peace, love.

14:54.878 --> 14:57.286
What you're describing

14:57.464 --> 15:01.628
was once known in the vernacular
as a happiness pill.

15:01.802 --> 15:05.752
And you, as a scientist, should know
that that's not possible.

15:05.932 --> 15:07.556
Come.

15:09.519 --> 15:11.844
I was one of the first
to find them.

15:12.022 --> 15:14.061
The spores.

15:15.442 --> 15:17.186
Spores?

15:38.842 --> 15:40.171
No.

15:41.804 --> 15:43.179
It shouldn't hurt.

15:43.347 --> 15:45.055
No, I can't.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.559
Please don't.

15:48.394 --> 15:50.268
Not like this. It didn't hurt us.

15:50.689 --> 15:53.262
I am not like you.

16:15.382 --> 16:17.042
Now.

16:17.426 --> 16:20.096
Now you belong to all of us.

16:20.262 --> 16:22.255
And we to you.

16:22.515 --> 16:26.133
There's no need to hide
your inner face any longer.

16:26.478 --> 16:28.767
We understand.

16:38.157 --> 16:39.437
I love you.

16:42.495 --> 16:44.120
I can love you.

16:57.678 --> 16:59.920
Captain's log, supplemental.

17:00.097 --> 17:02.007
We have been ordered
by Starfleet Command

17:02.183 --> 17:05.433
to evacuate the colony
on Omicron III.

17:05.603 --> 17:08.807
However, the colony leader,
Elias Sandoval,

17:08.982 --> 17:13.359
has refused all cooperation
and will not listen to any arguments.

17:13.569 --> 17:15.528
- Sandoval.
- Captain, your arguments

17:15.698 --> 17:17.655
are very valid,
but they do not apply to us.

17:17.825 --> 17:20.910
- You're being unreasonable.
- Well, nevertheless. Excuse me.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.787
Excuse me.

17:23.164 --> 17:25.915
My orders are to remove
all the colonists,

17:26.084 --> 17:29.785
and that's exactly what I intend to do,
with or without your help.

17:30.255 --> 17:32.663
Without, I should think.

17:35.052 --> 17:37.092
Would you like to use
a butterfly net on him, Jim?

17:37.263 --> 17:39.884
- No, I don't think I'll use a...
- Captain.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.975
We've checked out everything.
It all seems normal

17:43.144 --> 17:44.722
except for the absence
of any animals.

17:44.896 --> 17:48.846
We have orders to evacuate
all colonists to Starbase 27.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.642
I want landing parties
to coordinate the colonists

17:51.820 --> 17:53.694
and prepare them
to transport up to the ship.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.402
We'll need extra
accommodations aboard.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.818
Where's Mr. Spock and Mr. DeSalle?

18:00.288 --> 18:02.411
We haven't seen them
since we began our check.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.627
DeSalle said he was going to examine
some native plants he found.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.205
Did Spock call in at all?

18:07.379 --> 18:08.707
No, he didn't.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.502
Spock. See to the landing parties,
will you, Mr. Sulu?

18:11.675 --> 18:13.170
Yes, sir.

18:13.511 --> 18:14.922
Spock.

18:17.682 --> 18:19.390
That one looks like a dragon.

18:20.226 --> 18:23.726
You see the tail
and the dorsal spines?

18:23.897 --> 18:25.890
I've never seen a dragon.

18:26.066 --> 18:27.608
I have.

18:27.776 --> 18:30.232
On Berengaria Vll.

18:31.197 --> 18:34.067
But I've never stopped
to look at clouds before.

18:36.953 --> 18:38.910
Or rainbows.

18:41.917 --> 18:46.378
Do you know I can tell you exactly
why one appears in the sky,

18:46.547 --> 18:50.130
but considering its beauty
has always been out of the question.

18:50.634 --> 18:52.461
Not here.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.949
Spock.

19:14.118 --> 19:15.778
Yes, what did you want?

19:16.496 --> 19:18.074
Spock, is that you?

19:18.248 --> 19:20.122
Yes, captain. What did you want?

19:20.292 --> 19:21.869
Where are you?

19:24.213 --> 19:26.122
I don't believe I want to tell you.

19:28.509 --> 19:30.917
Spock, I don't know what
you think you're doing,

19:31.095 --> 19:32.424
but this is an order.

19:32.597 --> 19:35.266
Report back to me at the settlement
in ten minutes.

19:35.433 --> 19:38.434
We're evacuating all colonists
to Starbase 27.

19:38.603 --> 19:40.430
No, I don't think so.

19:40.605 --> 19:42.812
You don't think so, what?

19:44.443 --> 19:46.815
I don't think so, sir.

19:49.991 --> 19:51.401
Spock.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.195
Report to me immediately.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.459
Spock.

20:01.420 --> 20:02.997
Acknowledge.

20:04.131 --> 20:05.542
Spock.

20:08.094 --> 20:10.715
The frequency is open,
but he doesn't answer.

20:11.055 --> 20:13.760
That didn't sound at all
like Spock, Jim.

20:13.933 --> 20:15.344
No...

20:15.935 --> 20:18.427
I thought you said you might like him
if he mellowed a little.

20:18.605 --> 20:20.313
- I didn't say that.
- You said that. L...

20:20.482 --> 20:22.274
Not exactly.

20:23.193 --> 20:25.352
He might be in trouble.

20:26.238 --> 20:28.361
Yes, take over
the landing party detail.

20:28.532 --> 20:30.406
Start getting those colonists aboard.

20:30.576 --> 20:32.403
How will you find Spock?

20:32.579 --> 20:34.737
The frequency is open.
It'll act as a homing device.

20:34.914 --> 20:36.991
Contact DeSalle.
Have him meet you here.

20:37.167 --> 20:39.492
Make sure the landing party
works in teams of two.

20:39.670 --> 20:42.540
I don't want anybody
left alone down here.

21:16.585 --> 21:17.913
Spock.

21:19.922 --> 21:21.749
Mr. Spock?

21:34.020 --> 21:36.227
What are you doing
with those things, DeSalle?

21:36.398 --> 21:39.518
Want you to take a good
close look at these, doc.

21:41.445 --> 21:43.568
They're very interesting.

21:47.744 --> 21:49.321
Mr. Spock.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.790
Are you out of your mind?

21:56.753 --> 21:59.161
You were told to report
to me at once.

21:59.465 --> 22:00.959
I didn't want to, Jim.

22:03.552 --> 22:05.426
Yes, I can see that.

22:11.061 --> 22:13.634
Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back
with us to the settlement

22:13.814 --> 22:15.688
and prepare to transport up
to the ship.

22:15.857 --> 22:17.767
There'll be no evacuation, Jim.

22:17.943 --> 22:21.811
But perhaps we should go back
and get you straightened out.

22:22.406 --> 22:24.233
Mr. Sulu, Mr. Spock is under arrest,

22:24.408 --> 22:26.947
and he's in your custody until
we get back to the Enterprise.

22:30.290 --> 22:31.749
Very well.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.660
Come with me.

22:56.110 --> 22:58.683
Mr. Sulu understands,
don't you, Mr. Sulu?

22:58.863 --> 23:02.813
Yes. I see now.

23:02.992 --> 23:06.527
Of course we can't remove
the colony. It would be wrong.

23:09.040 --> 23:13.501
I don't know what these plants are
or how they work on you,

23:13.670 --> 23:15.793
but you're all going back
to the settlement with me,

23:15.965 --> 23:18.420
and those colonists
are going aboard the ship.

23:20.970 --> 23:24.588
I can see the captain
is going to be difficult.

23:34.568 --> 23:36.477
Ready to beam up.

23:38.614 --> 23:40.406
Hiya, Jimmy boy.

23:40.575 --> 23:44.276
Hey, I've taken care of everything.
Now, all y'all got to do is just relax.

23:44.454 --> 23:46.197
Doctor's orders.

23:46.373 --> 23:47.915
How many of those
did you beam up?

23:48.083 --> 23:50.752
Must be might nigh on to 100 by now.

23:50.919 --> 23:53.078
Hey, doc, I'm ready to energise.

23:53.255 --> 23:54.915
Everything okay with those plants?

23:55.090 --> 23:57.629
This is the captain. Beam me up.

23:57.802 --> 23:59.841
Well, sure. If you want.

24:00.012 --> 24:02.764
I most certainly do. Energise.

24:10.941 --> 24:12.483
Lieutenant.

24:12.651 --> 24:15.771
Put me through to Admiral Komack
at Starfleet.

24:16.530 --> 24:18.357
I'm sorry, captain.

24:18.533 --> 24:19.943
I can't do that.

24:20.118 --> 24:21.576
What do you mean,
you can't do that?

24:21.744 --> 24:23.405
Follow standard procedure,
that's an order.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.619
I know it is, captain.

24:25.790 --> 24:29.160
But you see, all communications
are out.

24:30.712 --> 24:33.168
- Out?
- I short-circuited them.

24:33.340 --> 24:36.792
Except for ship-to-surface,
we'll need that for a while.

24:40.473 --> 24:43.143
It's really for the best, captain.

25:05.500 --> 25:09.000
Go back to your stations.
Get back to your stations.

25:09.171 --> 25:11.745
I'm sorry, sir. We're all
transporting down to join the colony.

25:11.924 --> 25:13.917
I said, get back to your station.

25:14.093 --> 25:15.552
No, sir.

25:17.430 --> 25:19.055
This is mutiny, mister.

25:19.974 --> 25:22.347
Yes, sir, it is.

25:30.986 --> 25:36.112
Captain's log, stardate 3417.5.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.451
The pod plants have spread
spores throughout the ship,

25:39.621 --> 25:42.290
carried by the ventilation system.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.326
Under their influence,

25:44.501 --> 25:47.419
my crew is deserting
to join the Omicron colony,

25:47.588 --> 25:50.459
and I can't stop them.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.379
I don't know why
I have not been infected,

25:53.553 --> 25:55.960
nor can I get Dr. McCoy

25:56.139 --> 26:00.386
to explain the physical-psychological
aspects of the infection.

26:00.894 --> 26:02.174
I'm not interested

26:02.354 --> 26:05.889
in any physical-psychological
aspects, Jim boy.

26:06.066 --> 26:08.392
We're all perfectly healthy
down here.

26:08.569 --> 26:11.487
I've heard that word a lot lately.
"Perfect." Everything's perfect.

26:11.656 --> 26:14.526
Yeah, that's right.
That's just what it is.

26:14.909 --> 26:16.818
I'll bet you've even
grown your tonsils back.

26:18.329 --> 26:19.740
Sure enough.

26:19.915 --> 26:21.907
Hey, Jim boy.

26:22.084 --> 26:28.336
Y'all ever have a real cold,
Georgia-style mint julep, huh?

26:28.757 --> 26:30.750
Look, Bones, I need your help.

26:30.927 --> 26:33.928
Can you run tests, blood samples,
anything at all to give us a lead

26:34.097 --> 26:36.220
on what these things are,
how to counteract them?

26:38.393 --> 26:41.430
Who wants to counteract
paradise, Jim boy?

26:41.605 --> 26:45.769
- McCoy out.
- Bones. Bones.

26:54.828 --> 26:57.401
Almost the entire ship's complement
has beamed down.

26:57.580 --> 26:58.909
I'm very pleased.

26:59.082 --> 27:02.167
The entire landing operation
is proceeding quite well.

27:02.336 --> 27:04.044
Where's McCoy?

27:04.421 --> 27:08.371
He went off to create something
called a mint julep.

27:08.592 --> 27:09.968
That's a drink, Jim.

27:10.136 --> 27:12.627
Captain, why don't you join us?

27:12.847 --> 27:15.718
In your own private paradise?

27:15.892 --> 27:17.470
The spores have made it that.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.229
Where did they originate?

27:20.564 --> 27:22.473
Lt's impossible to say.

27:22.649 --> 27:25.983
They drifted through space
until they finally landed here.

27:26.153 --> 27:29.154
You see, they actually
thrive on Berthold rays.

27:29.323 --> 27:33.867
The plants act as a repository
for thousands of microscopic spores

27:34.037 --> 27:36.493
until they find a human body
to inhabit.

27:36.790 --> 27:40.658
In return, they give you
complete health and peace of mind.

27:41.879 --> 27:44.002
That's paradise.

27:44.757 --> 27:46.833
We have no need or want, captain.

27:47.009 --> 27:49.216
It's a true Eden, Jim.

27:49.512 --> 27:52.798
There's belonging and love.

27:53.349 --> 27:55.342
No wants, no needs?

27:56.645 --> 27:59.350
We weren't meant for that.
None of us.

28:00.065 --> 28:02.188
Man stagnates if he has no ambition,

28:02.359 --> 28:04.435
no desire to be more than he is.

28:04.612 --> 28:06.605
We have what we need.

28:06.781 --> 28:08.026
Except a challenge.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.525
You don't understand, Jim.

28:11.828 --> 28:15.031
But you'll come around,
sooner or later.

28:15.957 --> 28:17.784
Join us.

28:18.252 --> 28:19.829
Please.

28:21.797 --> 28:23.920
I'm going back to the ship.

29:10.976 --> 29:13.383
Engineering. Scotty?

29:17.232 --> 29:19.106
Biochemistry lab.

29:19.860 --> 29:21.438
Security.

29:22.530 --> 29:25.733
Is there anyone onboard?
This is the captain.

29:49.976 --> 29:53.844
Captain's log, stardate 3417.7.

29:57.109 --> 29:58.520
Except for myself,

29:58.694 --> 30:03.736
all crew personnel have transported
to the surface of the planet.

30:04.492 --> 30:06.152
Mutinied.

30:07.996 --> 30:10.202
Lieutenant Uhura has
effectively sabotaged

30:10.373 --> 30:12.995
the communications station.

30:13.460 --> 30:18.288
I can only contact
the surface of the planet.

30:19.884 --> 30:24.511
The ship can be maintained
in orbit for several months.

30:24.681 --> 30:28.845
But even with automatic controls,
I cannot pilot her alone.

30:30.062 --> 30:36.017
In effect, I am marooned here.

30:50.626 --> 30:52.702
I'm beginning to realise...

30:55.047 --> 30:58.547
...just how big this ship
really is, how quiet.

30:59.469 --> 31:02.138
I don't know how
to get my crew back,

31:03.223 --> 31:06.841
how to counteract
the effect of the spores.

31:08.478 --> 31:13.556
I don't know
what I can offer against...

31:16.195 --> 31:18.069
...paradise.

31:51.442 --> 31:52.853
Enterprise to Mr. Spock.

31:53.235 --> 31:54.694
Yes, Jim, what is it now?

31:55.488 --> 31:58.109
I've joined you.
I understand now.

31:59.951 --> 32:01.493
Wonderful, Jim.

32:01.661 --> 32:02.942
When will you beam down?

32:03.496 --> 32:05.620
There are some things
in my quarters I want to pack.

32:05.832 --> 32:07.113
Good.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.914
Leila and I will meet you
at the beam-down point.

32:10.087 --> 32:11.629
Kirk out.

33:22.749 --> 33:24.327
No.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.051
No.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.923
I...

33:38.016 --> 33:40.009
...can't...

33:40.894 --> 33:42.721
...leave!

33:47.985 --> 33:49.610
Emotions.

33:54.117 --> 33:56.952
Violent emotions. Needs.

33:58.955 --> 34:00.913
Anger.

34:16.683 --> 34:19.221
Captain's log, supplemental.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.309
I think I've discovered the answer.

34:23.273 --> 34:26.773
But to carry out my plan
entails considerable risk.

34:26.944 --> 34:31.108
Mr. Spock is much stronger
than the ordinary human being.

34:31.282 --> 34:35.280
Aroused, his great physical strength
could kill.

34:37.038 --> 34:39.956
But it's a risk I'll have to take.

34:41.001 --> 34:42.661
Enterprise to Mr. Spock.

34:42.835 --> 34:45.588
- Spock here.
- It's Jim.

34:45.755 --> 34:47.583
What's keeping you, Jim?
We've been waiting.

34:48.509 --> 34:51.842
I've been packing some things, and
I realised there's some equipment here

34:52.013 --> 34:54.469
that we should have
down at the settlement.

34:54.641 --> 34:58.342
You know, we can't come back
onboard once the last of us has left.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.264
Do you want me to beam up a party?

35:01.231 --> 35:04.565
No, I think you and I can handle it.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.645
Why don't you beam up now?

35:07.196 --> 35:08.988
Just a moment.

35:10.158 --> 35:14.405
- It won't take long. Do you mind?
- I'll wait.

35:21.170 --> 35:22.581
Ready to beam up, Jim.

35:25.341 --> 35:27.085
Energising.

35:34.518 --> 35:39.061
All right, you mutinous, disloyal,
computerised half-breed.

35:39.231 --> 35:41.603
We'll see about you
deserting my ship.

35:43.736 --> 35:47.354
The term "half-breed"
is somewhat applicable.

35:47.532 --> 35:50.023
But "computerised" is inaccurate.

35:50.201 --> 35:52.823
A machine can be computerised,
not a man.

35:52.996 --> 35:55.666
What makes you think you're a man?
You're an overgrown jackrabbit.

35:55.832 --> 35:58.121
An elf with a hyperactive thyroid.

35:59.545 --> 36:02.118
- Jim, I don't understand.
- Of course you don't understand.

36:02.298 --> 36:03.958
You don't have the brains
to understand.

36:04.133 --> 36:05.627
All you have is printed circuits.

36:08.388 --> 36:10.677
- Captain, if you'll excuse me...
- What can you expect

36:10.849 --> 36:14.633
from a simpering, devil-eared freak
whose father was a computer

36:14.811 --> 36:16.270
and his mother an encyclopaedia?

36:16.438 --> 36:18.561
My mother was a teacher.

36:18.732 --> 36:20.392
My father, an ambassador.

36:20.735 --> 36:24.733
Your father was a computer,
like his son.

36:24.906 --> 36:27.907
An ambassador from a planet
of traitors.

36:28.076 --> 36:30.365
The Vulcan never lived
who had an ounce of integrity.

36:30.537 --> 36:32.079
Captain, please don't...

36:32.247 --> 36:34.323
You're a traitor
from a race of traitors.

36:35.292 --> 36:38.708
Disloyal to the core. Rotten like
the rest of your subhuman race.

36:38.879 --> 36:44.087
And you've got the gall
to make love to that girl.

36:45.678 --> 36:47.338
That's enough.

36:47.514 --> 36:50.005
Does she know what
she's getting, Spock?

36:50.600 --> 36:52.510
A carcass full of memory banks

36:52.686 --> 36:55.391
who should be squatting
on a mushroom

36:56.148 --> 36:57.856
instead of passing
himself off as a man?

36:58.025 --> 37:02.652
You belong in a circus, Spock,
not a starship.

37:03.448 --> 37:07.066
Right next to the dog-faced boy.

37:37.485 --> 37:39.145
Had enough?

37:40.405 --> 37:43.275
I didn't realise what it took
to get under that thick hide of yours.

37:44.284 --> 37:46.775
Anyhow, I don't know
what you're so mad about.

37:46.953 --> 37:49.990
It isn't every first officer
who gets to belt his captain.

37:50.165 --> 37:52.039
Several times.

37:55.212 --> 37:57.668
You did that to me deliberately.

37:58.174 --> 38:00.167
Believe me, Mr. Spock,

38:00.677 --> 38:03.797
it was painful in more ways than one.

38:03.972 --> 38:05.550
The spores.

38:05.974 --> 38:07.682
They're gone.

38:10.270 --> 38:11.895
I don't belong anymore.

38:12.106 --> 38:13.933
You said they were benevolent
and peaceful.

38:14.108 --> 38:17.607
Violent emotions overwhelm them,
destroy them.

38:17.862 --> 38:21.362
I had to make you angry enough
to shake off their influence.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.822
That's the answer, Mr. Spock.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.242
That may be correct, captain.

38:27.748 --> 38:29.325
But trying to initiate a brawl

38:29.500 --> 38:32.785
with over 500 crew men
and colonists is hardly logical.

38:33.003 --> 38:34.546
I had something else in mind.

38:34.714 --> 38:38.414
Can you put together
a subsonic transmitter?

38:38.593 --> 38:41.049
Something we could hook
into the communications station

38:41.221 --> 38:43.712
and broadcast over
the communicator?

38:44.683 --> 38:47.886
- It can be done.
- Good. Let's get to work.

38:48.437 --> 38:49.979
Captain.

38:53.109 --> 38:57.522
Striking a fellow officer
is a court-martial offence.

38:59.908 --> 39:01.532
Well, if we're both in the brig,

39:01.701 --> 39:04.572
who's gonna build
the subsonic transmitter?

39:06.373 --> 39:08.532
That is quite logical, captain.

39:18.219 --> 39:21.885
Well, now, it's a little early
to be counting stars, Miss Leila.

39:22.057 --> 39:25.260
I'm waiting for Mr. Spock
and the captain to transport down.

39:25.435 --> 39:28.105
They have some equipment
to be moved.

39:28.272 --> 39:29.683
But it's been so long.

39:29.857 --> 39:31.268
I wish he'd come back.

39:31.442 --> 39:34.692
Well, now, I think
I can fix that for you.

39:36.030 --> 39:37.275
Enterprise.

39:44.039 --> 39:45.783
Enterprise. Spock here.

39:53.132 --> 39:54.924
This is Leila.

39:55.093 --> 39:58.010
I borrowed the doctor's
communicator.

39:58.471 --> 40:00.797
I was worried something might
have happened to you.

40:03.352 --> 40:04.976
You are all right, aren't you?

40:05.145 --> 40:06.688
Yes.

40:07.398 --> 40:09.390
Yes, I'm... I'm quite well.

40:11.485 --> 40:13.146
Can I come aboard?

40:13.321 --> 40:15.812
I've never seen a starship before.

40:16.324 --> 40:18.566
And I want to talk to you.

40:18.827 --> 40:21.033
Are you still at the beam-down point?

40:21.204 --> 40:22.615
And is the doctor there?

40:24.082 --> 40:25.909
Yes, to both questions.

40:27.378 --> 40:30.332
Give your communicator
back to Dr. McCoy.

40:30.673 --> 40:32.832
You won't need it to beam up.

40:33.009 --> 40:35.714
It'll take a few moments.
Just wait there.

40:36.513 --> 40:37.924
Out.

40:38.390 --> 40:40.217
Mr. Spock.

40:44.855 --> 40:50.858
Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern,
but should you talk to her

40:51.028 --> 40:54.232
while she's still under
the influence of the spores?

40:57.369 --> 40:59.777
I'll be back shortly, captain.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.448
You're no longer with us, are you?

41:45.212 --> 41:46.956
I felt something was wrong.

41:47.757 --> 41:49.132
It was necessary.

41:51.719 --> 41:53.843
Come back to the planet with me.

41:54.806 --> 41:56.348
You can belong again.

41:57.267 --> 42:00.103
Come back with me, please.

42:02.273 --> 42:03.553
I can't.

42:13.535 --> 42:15.492
I love you.

42:16.580 --> 42:18.786
I said that six years ago,

42:18.957 --> 42:23.038
and I can't seem to stop
repeating myself.

42:24.422 --> 42:27.339
On Earth, you couldn't give
anything of yourself.

42:28.343 --> 42:31.130
You couldn't even put
your arms around me.

42:33.139 --> 42:35.512
We couldn't have anything
together there.

42:35.684 --> 42:38.721
We couldn't have anything
together anyplace else.

42:40.481 --> 42:42.770
But we're happy here.

42:43.276 --> 42:46.561
I can't lose you now, Mr. Spock.
I can't.

42:47.572 --> 42:52.863
I have a responsibility to this ship.

42:54.538 --> 42:56.661
To that man on the bridge.

42:59.793 --> 43:02.332
I am what I am, Leila,

43:03.673 --> 43:07.007
and if there are
self-made purgatories,

43:07.677 --> 43:10.382
and we all have to live in them,

43:12.891 --> 43:15.299
mine can be no worse
than someone else's.

43:17.938 --> 43:20.346
I have lost you, haven't I?

43:24.862 --> 43:26.820
Not only you.

43:27.365 --> 43:29.322
I've lost all of it.

43:30.118 --> 43:32.027
The spores.

43:33.038 --> 43:35.078
I've lost them too.

43:35.791 --> 43:39.409
The captain discovered
that strong emotions

43:39.587 --> 43:42.374
and needs destroy
the spore influence.

43:43.883 --> 43:46.291
And this is for my good?

43:50.432 --> 43:52.970
Do you mind if I say I still love you?

44:03.738 --> 44:07.190
You never told me
if you had another name, Mr. Spock.

44:18.587 --> 44:20.746
You couldn't pronounce it.

44:31.685 --> 44:33.096
They'll not hear this, of course.

44:33.270 --> 44:35.596
It'll be more of a sensation
of feeling it.

44:35.773 --> 44:38.560
As though somebody had put
itching powder on their skin.

44:38.734 --> 44:40.229
Precisely.

44:40.403 --> 44:43.772
Now, it should begin to work
on their nerves in a few minutes.

44:54.794 --> 44:57.119
- Sorry, DeSalle.
- What do you think you're doing?

44:57.296 --> 44:59.622
- I said I was sorry.
- More like you're clumsy.

44:59.799 --> 45:02.373
If you hadn't gotten in my way...

45:19.654 --> 45:22.489
Come on, break it up. Break it up.

45:36.714 --> 45:38.173
Well, doctor,

45:38.341 --> 45:41.959
I've been thinking about
what sort of work I can assign you to.

45:42.387 --> 45:43.668
What do you mean?

45:43.847 --> 45:45.507
What sort of work? I'm a doctor.

45:45.682 --> 45:48.767
Not anymore, of course.
We don't need you. Not as a doctor.

45:49.186 --> 45:51.013
Oh, no?

45:55.443 --> 45:58.527
Would you like to see just how fast
I can put you in a hospital?

45:58.696 --> 46:00.356
I am the leader of this colony.

46:00.532 --> 46:03.153
I'll assign you to whatever work
I think is suitable.

46:03.326 --> 46:05.153
Just a minute.

46:06.580 --> 46:08.454
Better make me a mechanic.

46:08.624 --> 46:11.827
Then I can treat
little tin gods like you.

46:24.099 --> 46:26.175
Sorry, Sandoval.

46:27.269 --> 46:29.309
I don't know what made me do that.

46:35.028 --> 46:37.234
We've done nothing here.

46:39.407 --> 46:42.527
No accomplishments. No progress.

46:44.204 --> 46:46.742
Three years wasted.

46:48.417 --> 46:51.418
We wanted to make
this planet a garden.

46:53.172 --> 46:55.746
You can't stay here.

46:56.301 --> 46:58.839
You can't survive without the spores.

47:01.431 --> 47:06.806
After you've cleared at the starbase,
you could be relocated.

47:07.146 --> 47:08.724
It depends upon what you want.

47:09.899 --> 47:11.773
I think I'd...

47:14.279 --> 47:16.948
I think we'd like
to get some work done.

47:17.115 --> 47:19.440
The work we started out to do.

47:23.330 --> 47:25.038
Enterprise.

47:25.207 --> 47:26.701
Enterprise. Spock here.

47:26.876 --> 47:28.619
This is McCoy.

47:28.794 --> 47:30.752
Sandoval would like
to talk to the captain.

47:30.922 --> 47:32.582
Just a moment.

47:32.757 --> 47:34.417
They're all beginning
to call in, captain.

47:34.592 --> 47:36.419
Rather contritely, I should say.

47:36.594 --> 47:38.137
Sandoval wishes to speak to you.

47:38.305 --> 47:41.306
Put him on the speaker. Kirk here.

47:41.808 --> 47:47.598
Captain, as I understood it, you were
to transport us to Starbase 27.

47:47.773 --> 47:49.268
We'll give you every cooperation.

47:51.319 --> 47:53.775
Start making preparations,
Mr. Sandoval.

47:53.947 --> 47:56.153
We'll begin transporting
your people aboard

47:56.324 --> 47:59.279
as soon as more
of our crew checks in.

48:13.760 --> 48:17.010
Well, Jim, I've just examined
the last of the colonists.

48:17.180 --> 48:21.178
They're all in absolutely
perfect, perfect health.

48:22.019 --> 48:24.059
A fringe benefit left over
by the spores.

48:24.230 --> 48:25.510
Good.

48:30.153 --> 48:33.652
Well, that's the second time
Man's been thrown out of paradise.

48:34.074 --> 48:37.443
No, no, Bones. This time
we walked out on our own.

48:37.703 --> 48:41.368
Maybe we weren't meant
for paradise.

48:42.207 --> 48:44.496
Maybe we were meant
to fight our way through.

48:44.668 --> 48:49.046
Struggle, claw our way up,
scratch for every inch of the way.

48:49.674 --> 48:53.506
Maybe we can't stroll
to the music of the lute.

48:54.137 --> 48:56.972
We must march
to the sound of drums.

48:57.558 --> 49:00.393
Poetry, captain? Non-regulation.

49:01.353 --> 49:05.019
We haven't heard much from you
about Omicron Ceti III, Mr. Spock.

49:06.150 --> 49:08.820
I have little to say about it, captain.

49:09.737 --> 49:11.695
Except that...

49:12.365 --> 49:14.821
...for the first time in my life,

49:15.535 --> 49:17.327
I was happy.
