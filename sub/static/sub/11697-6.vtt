WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:03.097
Okay, Emma.
All aboard the Tucker train.

00:03.528 --> 00:06.563
- Tucka-tucka tucka-tucka--
- ( Sputters )

00:09.401 --> 00:12.103
Look, baby, I ain't got
nowhere else to be.

00:12.171 --> 00:14.138
- We can do this all day, okay?
- ( Coughs )

00:16.175 --> 00:17.573
Okay, I'm out.

00:18.141 --> 00:21.111
Oh my God,
moving is exhausting.

00:23.547 --> 00:25.916
Especially if you're
actually carrying things.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.719
Coming through.
Biceps burning.

00:29.787 --> 00:33.189
( Groans ) Not quite
as in shape as I look.

00:33.256 --> 00:36.292
Oh-hell-to-the-no.

00:36.359 --> 00:38.294
What is all of
this stuff?

00:38.361 --> 00:40.996
- She is not moving in here.
- Oh relax, peanut.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.234
These are just a few
cherished memories

00:45.302 --> 00:47.069
that I've saved
from my boys' childhood.

00:47.137 --> 00:50.338
Also known as crap-she-couldn't-unload-
at-the-garage-sale.

00:50.905 --> 00:52.006
Not crap.

00:52.074 --> 00:55.343
These boxes represent
a lifetime of awesomeness.

00:55.410 --> 00:57.979
And we'd all hate to forget
how awesome you are.

00:59.815 --> 01:01.482
Wait.

01:01.550 --> 01:03.551
Are these all filled
with Danny's trophies?

01:03.618 --> 01:06.153
'Cause, you know, I accomplished
a few things growing up as well.

01:06.221 --> 01:09.789
Oh, if only they gave awards
for making fake ID's.

01:11.326 --> 01:13.393
I saved some
of your stuff too, honey.

01:13.461 --> 01:15.662
Uh, yeah, ah.

01:19.533 --> 01:21.334
A picture I painted
in kindergarten

01:21.401 --> 01:23.736
and a Thanksgiving
hand turkey?

01:23.803 --> 01:26.638
I'm sorry, honey.

01:26.706 --> 01:29.208
I can't be expected to
keep track of everything.

01:29.276 --> 01:31.878
- Hey, where are my college trophies?
- Downstairs, backseat.

01:31.945 --> 01:34.046
The boxes should be
color-coded and dated.

01:36.449 --> 01:38.083
Hey, man,
don't feel bad, okay?

01:38.150 --> 01:40.252
She didn't save
his hand turkey.

01:40.319 --> 01:42.820
Look!
My hand turkey!

01:44.823 --> 01:46.191
( Theme music playing )

01:46.259 --> 01:49.160

how the unexpected ♪

01:55.800 --> 01:57.868
I can't quite put
my finger on it,

01:57.936 --> 02:02.940
but something about this
place feels different.

02:03.008 --> 02:05.442
You've heard the expression
"winner takes all."

02:05.510 --> 02:08.145
This is all.

02:08.213 --> 02:10.579
Hey, Riley.
Thanks for watching Emma.

02:10.646 --> 02:13.182
- First practice of the season.
- Wow.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.951
I've never seen you
look so jocky.

02:15.019 --> 02:17.053
Danny's not the only one

02:17.121 --> 02:19.555
who can put a jersey on
and hit things with a stick.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.193
It's softball,
and they haven't won a game.

02:24.261 --> 02:26.094
Do I need to say more?

02:27.162 --> 02:28.797
Found 'em.

02:28.864 --> 02:31.400
They were in the storage room
next to the Christmas lights

02:31.467 --> 02:34.102
and what I thought was
Mrs. Bart's lost chihuahua.

02:36.605 --> 02:38.907
It wasn't.

02:38.975 --> 02:41.708
Thanks, man.
And there will be no trash talking

02:41.776 --> 02:43.911
- of the B-Bar Brawlers.
- I'm sorry.

02:43.979 --> 02:46.680
I just don't see the point of playing
if you're not at least trying to win.

02:46.748 --> 02:49.650
- Back me up here, Riley.
- ( Scoffs ) Oh no.

02:49.717 --> 02:52.320
I've known you both long enough
to know that "back me up, Riley"

02:52.387 --> 02:55.556
is two seconds away from "shut up, Riley.
Who asked you?"

02:57.091 --> 02:59.125
The point--
wait for it--

02:59.193 --> 03:01.962
is to have fun,
and the fun is what I bring.

03:02.029 --> 03:04.497
How do you think I got
elected team captain?

03:04.565 --> 03:06.699
Well, you gave us
free beer and ballots

03:06.767 --> 03:08.534
and said "vote for me."

03:09.602 --> 03:11.271
Oh my God, look at this.

03:11.339 --> 03:14.673
Varsity lacrosse--
you and me, front and center.

03:14.740 --> 03:18.444
Which is fairly unfortunate for
all the people in the back.

03:18.511 --> 03:20.579
You two were
on the same team?

03:20.646 --> 03:22.781
They didn't call her
Rigantor for nothing.

03:22.849 --> 03:24.583
- She was tougher...
- And wider.

03:24.650 --> 03:26.551
...than any guy on the field.

03:26.619 --> 03:28.553
You wanna come play?
Everyone's welcome.

03:28.621 --> 03:31.356
Not really doing
the sports thing anymore.

03:31.423 --> 03:34.658
God, this just feels
like a different life.

03:34.726 --> 03:36.827
Well, you athletes
enjoy your afternoon.

03:36.895 --> 03:39.597
I've gotta get to the rink
and hit stuff with a stick...

03:39.664 --> 03:42.733
For money.
( Chuckles )

03:42.801 --> 03:44.469
Hey, we gotta get movin'.

03:44.536 --> 03:47.270
I need to go hit things
with a stick for beer.

03:47.338 --> 03:48.738
( Mocking laughter )

03:50.375 --> 03:53.877
All right, Brawlers, I'd like to
propose a little pre-game toast.

03:53.944 --> 03:56.346
May we always remember
that winning isn't everything,

03:56.414 --> 03:58.615
but having a full keg is.
Game on!

03:58.682 --> 04:01.350
- ( Cheers )
- Oh, hold up.

04:01.418 --> 04:03.319
I think we have
a couple pinch hitters.

04:03.387 --> 04:06.588
Everyone, this is Riley
and my daughter Emma.

04:06.656 --> 04:09.091
So if you're keeping score
that's Wheeler, 1-0

04:09.159 --> 04:11.127
in the unplanned-pregnancy
game.

04:11.194 --> 04:13.862
Hey, Tuck, you wanna try some
pop-ups while I get them settled?

04:13.930 --> 04:15.898
Oh, I'm good.
I already ate.

04:18.401 --> 04:20.668
I meant-- ( Grunts )

04:24.340 --> 04:26.241
I'm so glad
you guys came down.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.609
I thought it'd be nice for
Emma to see her daddy play.

04:28.677 --> 04:31.779
- Hit a few over the fence.
- Clearly you've never seen me play,

04:31.847 --> 04:33.747
'cause that's not exactly
what I'm known for.

04:33.814 --> 04:36.517
- ( Bat thunks )
- Tucker: Ben!

04:37.919 --> 04:41.155
Really?
Glue on home plate.

04:41.222 --> 04:44.391
That's what
I'm known for.

04:46.394 --> 04:49.295
Yoo-hoo.
Lady in the locker room.

04:51.831 --> 04:53.866
But don't feel
any pressure to cover up.

04:55.602 --> 04:57.570
Hi, cowboy.

04:57.637 --> 05:00.906
- Mom, what are you doing?!
- Oh hi, Danny.

05:00.974 --> 05:03.476
I told you not
to come see me here.

05:03.544 --> 05:05.577
And I'm not.
I didn't even know you were here.

05:05.644 --> 05:08.613
That's worse.
If my coach sees you again--

05:08.681 --> 05:11.083
oh, damn it, there he is.
Mom, please don't embarrass me.

05:11.150 --> 05:14.786
- Hey, coach Hayes--
- Wheeler. Hi, Bonnie.

05:14.853 --> 05:17.222
- Hey, Hank.
- I'm really sorry about--

05:17.290 --> 05:20.058
Bonnie? Hank?

05:21.293 --> 05:23.060
I'm glad you're cool
with this, Wheeler.

05:23.128 --> 05:24.528
A lot of guys
wouldn't be.

05:24.596 --> 05:27.664
- Wouldn't be what?
- Me going out with your mom.

05:29.801 --> 05:31.902
It takes him a minute...

05:31.970 --> 05:34.638
You're going out
with my mom?!!

05:34.706 --> 05:37.074
... But he always
gets there.

05:37.174 --> 05:40.009
I was going to talk to you myself,
but Bonnie said she'd handle it.

05:40.077 --> 05:42.845
And I handled it
by not telling him.

05:42.913 --> 05:46.449
See? Absolutely nothing
embarrassing whatsoever.

05:46.517 --> 05:49.185
Happy? Okay, no.
Bye-bye. We should go.

05:54.424 --> 05:57.126
You can't tell me you're
actually okay with this.

05:57.193 --> 05:58.994
I'm actually
okay with this.

05:59.061 --> 06:01.363
Well, your mom dating
your coach should make

06:01.431 --> 06:03.232
for some interesting
pillow talk.

06:03.299 --> 06:05.400
What?
No pillows.

06:05.468 --> 06:07.402
How did there suddenly
get to be pillows?

06:07.470 --> 06:09.270
They were just going
to happy hour.

06:09.338 --> 06:12.072
If I recall, the last girl
you took to happy hour

06:12.141 --> 06:14.475
got so happy we got
a noise complaint.

06:17.613 --> 06:20.214
But that's different.
They wouldn't--

06:20.282 --> 06:22.750
she's a mom!

06:22.817 --> 06:26.286
And Ben's a dad.
Hasn't slowed him down.

06:26.354 --> 06:29.456
It would take a lot more
than a baby.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.593
That's it-- I can't think
about this anymore.

06:33.661 --> 06:36.596
I'm going to go workout until
even my brain is exhausted.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.398
See ya' in 20.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.334
Any progress?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.638
If she could eat through her
nose, I'd say she's doing great.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.877
- Aww.
- Mystery solved.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.413
- She's a Daddy's girl.
- ( Phone vibrates )

06:57.283 --> 06:59.584
Ah, Tucker and the guys
are already at the field.

06:59.652 --> 07:02.119
I should finish feeding her.
Mom's gonna be here soon,

07:02.188 --> 07:04.389
can you run my equipment
down to the field for me?

07:04.456 --> 07:06.357
And take my mitt.
You'll have fun. I promise.

07:08.860 --> 07:10.928
Oof.
This weighed so much less

07:10.996 --> 07:13.297
when I weighed
so much more.

07:20.688 --> 07:23.490
You don't care about a
shelf-full of trophies, do you?

07:23.558 --> 07:25.792
Your daddy's still a winner
in your eyes, right?

07:29.129 --> 07:31.296
I'll take that as a "yes."

07:35.301 --> 07:36.936
Hey, Brawlers.
Sorry I'm so late.

07:37.003 --> 07:40.405
- We did it. We won!
- At what?

07:40.973 --> 07:42.675
Softball.
First time ever.

07:42.742 --> 07:44.977
But it was all Riley.
She was incredible.

07:45.045 --> 07:48.012
- Riley?
- Ben! Did you hear?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.314
Oh my God, you were right.
This was so fun.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.817
- These guys are awesome.
- No, you're awesome.

07:54.887 --> 07:56.888
Three home runs!
Three.

07:56.956 --> 07:59.123
I think she even made
the umpire cry.

08:00.191 --> 08:02.693
Sounds like
I missed a great game.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.195
Oh, um...

08:06.263 --> 08:09.299
One other minor thing
you missed.

08:09.366 --> 08:11.935
The guys voted Riley
team captain.

08:12.003 --> 08:14.671
What?
How could they--

08:14.739 --> 08:18.574
wait. I thought the vote
had to be unanimous.

08:20.276 --> 08:23.378
I might have gotten
caught up in the moment.

08:23.446 --> 08:24.446
High-five?

08:30.682 --> 08:32.114
Ben, I don't know what happened.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.714
I do.

08:33.782 --> 08:36.784
I was feeding my baby
and you took over my team.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.052
I'm sorry.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.054
One minute I was
picking up a glove

08:41.121 --> 08:43.424
and the next thing I knew
everyone was shouting...

08:43.491 --> 08:45.859
( Mimics crowd )
"You're amazing!"

08:46.927 --> 08:49.296
Okay, first it started out
as "awesome,"

08:49.363 --> 08:51.765
then, you know,
it went to "amazing."

08:52.866 --> 08:54.901
Why are we even having
this conversation?

08:54.968 --> 08:57.170
- I'm obviously not going to do it.
- Really?

08:57.237 --> 09:00.039
'Cause I heard
you were "amazing."

09:01.642 --> 09:03.643
- Ben--
- No, it's okay.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.377
The team seemed
pretty happy.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.614
Maybe it'd be a good thing
if you took over for a while.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.117
Are you sure? Because I really
don't care one way or the other.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.687
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Oh my God! Yes! Thank you!

09:14.754 --> 09:16.322
This is going
to be so much fun.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.357
I forgot how much
I missed playing--

09:18.425 --> 09:20.892
the camaraderie, the
competition, the chanting--

09:20.960 --> 09:23.428
"in your face, suckers."
Oh, I'm so excited!

09:25.230 --> 09:26.964
When'd you get home?
Where'd you go?

09:27.032 --> 09:29.033
He behaved himself,
right?

09:30.202 --> 09:32.670
Sure.
Let's go with that.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.274
We just went out
for some Italian food.

09:37.342 --> 09:38.742
Italian food?

09:38.810 --> 09:40.777
Oh, we all know
what that means.

09:42.714 --> 09:44.614
No, we don't!
What does that mean?

09:44.682 --> 09:47.183
This is exactly what
I was trying to avoid.

09:47.251 --> 09:49.853
Honey, I think I should keep
this part of my life private.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.856
- Private?
- In other words,

09:52.923 --> 09:56.191
just because he's your coach, don't
expect to know when he scores.

09:59.863 --> 10:03.265
- Don't you have something better to do?
- No, not better than this, no.

10:05.935 --> 10:09.671
Okay, honey, I know that you
don't want to hear this,

10:09.739 --> 10:13.408
but I'm a woman
and I have needs.

10:14.476 --> 10:16.745
So make a list.
I'll get whatever you need right now.

10:20.382 --> 10:23.718
- So are we good?
- ♪ I'm captain. ♪

10:23.786 --> 10:26.520
- Ben talked me into it.
- Without even opening my mouth.

10:27.856 --> 10:29.890
The only thing
we haven't figured out yet:

10:29.957 --> 10:31.358
Who's watching Emma
on Saturday?

10:31.426 --> 10:33.994
It's not gonna be me.
Hank invited me to lunch

10:34.061 --> 10:37.264
and I'm not canceling.
Our schedules are almost impossible to hook up.

10:37.331 --> 10:39.867
- She said "hook up."
- Okay.

10:40.934 --> 10:42.301
I'll do it.

10:42.369 --> 10:45.405
I'll watch Emma. I'd hate for anyone
to have to cancel their plans.

10:45.472 --> 10:47.973
- Well, thank you, Danny.
- Problem solved.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.412
( Softly )
Not yet, but it will be.

10:59.518 --> 11:01.753
Oh, honey,
are you okay?

11:01.821 --> 11:05.056
No. My tooth is throbbing
like a jackhammer.

11:05.124 --> 11:07.459
I got here as soon
as I could.

11:07.527 --> 11:10.094
My hair, however,
is 30 minutes away.

11:10.162 --> 11:12.497
I didn't know who else
to call to watch Emma.

11:12.565 --> 11:14.932
- Can I see it? Is your tooth cracked?
- Ow!

11:14.999 --> 11:17.334
Don't! The dentist said he
could see me right now.

11:17.402 --> 11:18.669
- I won't be long, I promise.
- Good.

11:18.737 --> 11:20.805
Because I'm supposed to meet
Hank in less than an hour.

11:20.872 --> 11:23.841
- Oh, is that today?
- Just go.

11:24.909 --> 11:27.945
And remember-- don't take
home the giant toothbrush.

11:28.012 --> 11:30.079
It's the bathroom key.

11:31.147 --> 11:32.415
Thanks, mom.

11:35.953 --> 11:38.488
Sorry about
your date, Hank.

11:40.624 --> 11:42.892
Sorry, Tuck.
I can't make it to the game.

11:45.895 --> 11:48.964
Jury duty.
But don't ask me the details,

11:49.031 --> 11:52.334
I took an oath.
I shouldn't even be talking to you now.

11:53.703 --> 11:55.604
- Danny!
- Ben.

11:56.172 --> 11:58.841
Please tell me that Emma
is outside parking the car.

11:58.908 --> 12:00.642
No, she-- wait.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.777
Aren't you supposed
to be playing softball?

12:03.345 --> 12:04.645
No, I had to stay.
We're swamped.

12:06.181 --> 12:08.950
- Where's my baby?
- Relax. Mom's got her.

12:09.267 --> 12:12.536
Hank cancelled or something-- not
real sure about the details.

12:12.604 --> 12:14.105
Huh.

12:14.172 --> 12:17.208
Maybe I should just
ask Hank. Isn't that him?

12:17.275 --> 12:19.675
Oh, crap.
Hide me!

12:22.479 --> 12:26.249
- What are you doing?
- Okay, so maybe that story wasn't completely true.

12:26.316 --> 12:29.719
But if mom asks, they had to
put me under for a root canal.

12:29.787 --> 12:31.520
Unbelievable.

12:31.588 --> 12:33.656
No, it's not.
They'll do it if you ask.

12:35.191 --> 12:36.992
No. You.

12:37.060 --> 12:39.494
How could you do this to Mom?
She seems really happy.

12:39.562 --> 12:42.164
Oh, like you care about
other people's happiness.

12:42.232 --> 12:45.367
How's Riley going to feel when she finds
out you quit because she took over?

12:45.434 --> 12:46.969
This isn't quitting.

12:47.036 --> 12:49.337
It's not showing up
and hoping she doesn't notice.

12:49.405 --> 12:51.605
Dude, you're supposed
to have her back.

12:51.673 --> 12:55.643
Why do you think she
stopped being Rigantor?

12:55.710 --> 12:58.312
She got tired of all the small
planes buzzing around her head?

12:58.880 --> 13:01.849
No. She didn't think
she'd ever have any friends,

13:01.917 --> 13:04.085
that guys
would never like her.

13:04.153 --> 13:07.020
I'm just saying, you did a good thing.
Don't screw it up now.

13:07.088 --> 13:09.556
- Hey, can I settle up?
- ( Bottles rattle )

13:11.426 --> 13:13.727
- It's on the house.
- Thanks.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.033
You're right.
I'm being an idiot.

13:20.101 --> 13:21.802
But so are you.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.637
If it's not Hank,
it's going to be someone else.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.478
Hey, can I get
a bar menu down here?

13:33.546 --> 13:34.546
Thanks.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.685
Hey, Mom, I'm back!

13:39.752 --> 13:40.919
Coach?

13:42.722 --> 13:45.023
- Danny!
- What are you doing here?

13:45.090 --> 13:46.525
In my robe?

13:46.992 --> 13:48.393
It's not
what it looks like.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.595
I'm pretty sure
that's my robe.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.064
Hank, you ready to go in
for round two?

13:53.132 --> 13:56.567
- Ahh--
- It's exactly what it looks like!

13:56.635 --> 13:59.236
- Wheeler, calm down!
- No, I'm not going to calm down.

13:59.304 --> 14:02.440
Hank, I'll handle this.
Danny, calm down.

14:02.507 --> 14:05.743
Maybe I should just
get dressed and then we--

14:05.811 --> 14:08.078
- or I could just go.
- Hank, no.

14:08.146 --> 14:10.380
- Hank, yes.
- Honestly, Wheeler, listen,

14:10.448 --> 14:12.882
- if you would just give me two seconds--
- One two.

14:13.951 --> 14:16.820
Oh, Danny, nothing
was going on here.

14:16.887 --> 14:20.256
I've heard that before.
I believe Dad called it wrestling.

14:20.324 --> 14:23.059
Wait.
What happened to your tooth?

14:23.126 --> 14:25.194
- Ow.
- Other side.

14:26.696 --> 14:29.365
You are unbelievable!

14:29.432 --> 14:33.736
Do you know what went on here
this afternoon? We babysat.

14:33.803 --> 14:36.071
That's it.
But when we tried to feed Emma,

14:36.138 --> 14:39.174
she flung mashed bananas all
over everything we were wearing.

14:39.242 --> 14:41.577
Oh, yeah, she hates those.

14:41.644 --> 14:44.779
- So you weren't--
- Hooking up with a guy I barely knew

14:44.847 --> 14:46.881
while I'm supposed
to be babysitting? No!

14:46.948 --> 14:50.451
Please!
I'm not Grandma.

14:50.519 --> 14:53.120
Now if you'll excuse me,

14:53.188 --> 14:56.257
I still have banana
in my bra.

14:56.324 --> 14:58.525
- So you really--
- No, we didn't!

15:01.696 --> 15:03.329
Umpire:
Strike one!

15:03.398 --> 15:05.365
Hey, ump!
You got cable?

15:05.433 --> 15:08.535
'Cause we ain't watching
the same game.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.537
Hey, so sorry
I'm late again,

15:10.605 --> 15:11.905
but I've brought
a little peace offering.

15:11.972 --> 15:13.072
It's the top of the ninth,

15:13.140 --> 15:14.673
I don't really have time
for a prank right now.

15:14.741 --> 15:17.643
It's actually full of vodka.
So we drink it and then launch it.

15:17.711 --> 15:21.280
- There's a good chance we could clear the fence.
- First time for everything.

15:21.347 --> 15:23.649
Take a seat, Wheeler,
with the rest of the ladies.

15:23.717 --> 15:25.284
Hey hey, ump,

15:25.351 --> 15:29.021
turn your ringer on because
you're missing your calls!

15:30.723 --> 15:32.990
- So how's it going? Are we winning?
- We want you back!

15:33.058 --> 15:34.726
Please be
our captain again.

15:34.794 --> 15:38.062
- What about Riley?
- All right, Tuck, you're on deck.

15:38.130 --> 15:40.364
Strike out again and you'll be
lickin' the lines off the field.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.933
Look alive, people!

15:44.169 --> 15:45.837
We already voted.
The job's yours.

15:45.905 --> 15:47.604
But you have to fire her.

15:53.405 --> 15:55.604
The last time I told Riley
something she didn't want to hear,

15:55.605 --> 15:57.004
she made me eat crayons.

15:57.205 --> 15:59.504
I still tear up at the sight
of burnt sienna.

16:02.313 --> 16:05.081
Don't worry,
I've got your back, okay?

16:05.148 --> 16:06.916
Hey, teammates.

16:06.984 --> 16:09.552
Hi, Riley.
Oh, don't you look cute today?

16:09.620 --> 16:11.621
Oh, is that my phone?

16:14.325 --> 16:17.726
Hey, so what's up?
Everything okay?

16:17.793 --> 16:20.829
Yeah.
It's about the game.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.598
Oh, thank God.

16:22.665 --> 16:26.034
- I was worried I was going to
have to bring it up. - Excuse me?

16:27.102 --> 16:28.670
I know it's your thing,

16:28.738 --> 16:31.773
but you've gotta
rein in the crazy.

16:32.591 --> 16:36.076
Kinda trying to do
that right now.

16:36.145 --> 16:39.380
I just think you need to take the
game a little more seriously.

16:39.448 --> 16:42.517
You're putting me in a really
tough spot with the other guys.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.419
Truth is
I should've benched you.

16:47.356 --> 16:51.090
You were going to bench me?
Okay, this just got a whole lot easier.

16:52.159 --> 16:53.926
But I can't.

16:53.994 --> 16:55.595
You know I can't.

16:56.163 --> 16:57.830
You're the reason
I'm playing again

16:57.898 --> 16:59.732
and I missed it so much.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.035
Thank you.

17:02.102 --> 17:03.836
So what did you
want to tell me?

17:05.204 --> 17:07.005
Just...

17:07.073 --> 17:09.775
- That you're doing a really great job.
- Thanks.

17:09.842 --> 17:13.145
( Phones vibrate )

17:13.713 --> 17:16.382
"Ding dong,
Riley's gone.

17:16.449 --> 17:18.651
Ben's firing her
right now."

17:20.819 --> 17:22.987
What is this?

17:23.055 --> 17:25.890
The meaner version
of what I was gonna say.

17:31.597 --> 17:34.232
Hey, Coach,
can we talk?

17:34.300 --> 17:36.633
I suppose you want
your robe back.

17:37.935 --> 17:40.070
It's not how it...

17:42.340 --> 17:44.208
My mom told me
about what happened.

17:44.275 --> 17:46.310
I'm really sorry
for overreacting like that.

17:46.377 --> 17:49.079
- No hard feelings.
- Thanks for understanding.

17:49.396 --> 17:51.615
And I totally promise
to be better next time.

17:52.383 --> 17:54.483
I really don't think
there's gonna be a next time.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.952
Hey, don't blame her
because I'm a jerk.

17:57.020 --> 17:59.355
It's not you, Wheeler.
To be honest,

17:59.423 --> 18:02.024
I'm just not that into her.
Turns out she's not my type.

18:03.893 --> 18:06.729
- Not your type?
- Just a matter of taste.

18:06.796 --> 18:09.831
So you don't like funny beautiful women
who are totally out of your league?

18:09.898 --> 18:13.167
- Wheeler--
- No, that's my mom you're talking about.

18:13.236 --> 18:16.137
And the one thing I know for
sure is that no one's smarter,

18:16.205 --> 18:19.006
nicer or more caring
on this whole planet.

18:19.074 --> 18:21.109
And any guy would be lucky
to go out with her.

18:21.176 --> 18:23.478
I'll go out
with her.

18:24.946 --> 18:27.381
Yeah.
In your dreams.

18:30.352 --> 18:32.319
- ( Grunts )
- ( Crickets chirping )

18:34.356 --> 18:36.523
Hey.

18:36.591 --> 18:39.025
Are sure you feel safe
coming so close?

18:41.027 --> 18:42.995
I would if you put
the bat down.

18:43.063 --> 18:44.797
Ugh, what is
the matter with me?

18:44.865 --> 18:47.032
Maybe you're just too
smart and too beautiful.

18:48.269 --> 18:49.769
Again, still
holding the bat.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.273
You can change
the outside all you want,

18:53.340 --> 18:56.041
but the inside--
not so much.

18:59.345 --> 19:02.414
I couldn't do it--
I couldn't just have fun.

19:02.482 --> 19:04.416
Winning is fun for you.

19:04.484 --> 19:06.285
Oh my God, I love it!

19:06.852 --> 19:08.353
But what does that get me?

19:08.421 --> 19:11.690
A room full of trophies
and nobody to share them with?

19:11.758 --> 19:14.592
Danny seems to have
it figured out.

19:14.660 --> 19:17.127
Well, neither of us
are your brother.

19:17.195 --> 19:19.530
Yeah, I think I've probably
heard that one or two...

19:20.098 --> 19:22.400
...hundred thousand times.

19:22.467 --> 19:25.770
But he's not the brother
I wanted to be like.

19:27.506 --> 19:29.673
Truth:

19:29.740 --> 19:32.809
I once made up this whole
goofy victory dance

19:32.876 --> 19:36.513
so I could show people
that I can be fun too.

19:38.248 --> 19:40.450
- Oooh!
- I called it the Wheeler.

19:40.518 --> 19:43.886
- What happened?
- Somebody laughed and I decked them.

19:45.722 --> 19:47.623
Truth:

19:48.191 --> 19:51.560
I was kind of looking forward
to winning for a change.

19:52.378 --> 19:54.363
Never really
tried it before.

19:56.399 --> 20:00.068
Well, I think you and the Brawlers can
figure out how to do it without me.

20:00.136 --> 20:01.235
Maybe.

20:02.003 --> 20:03.137
But what fun
would that be?

20:03.205 --> 20:06.541
- Ben, nobody wants me.
- It doesn't matter. I want you.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.074

20:16.417 --> 20:18.117
- ( Glass shatters )
- ( Car alarm blaring )

20:18.185 --> 20:20.253
- I think we should probably run.
- Yeah, let's.

20:23.185 --> 20:24.753
All: Go Brawlers!

20:24.754 --> 20:26.153
Tucker: We're on a roll!

20:26.289 --> 20:28.690
All thanks
to my lovely co-captain.

20:28.759 --> 20:30.492
Riley even made up
with the umpire.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.262
Turns out he really
does need new glasses.

20:33.629 --> 20:36.632
- Ben.
- Hey, Mom. Come to help us celebrate?

20:36.699 --> 20:39.033
No, more like hide out.
Honey, you have to help me.

20:39.101 --> 20:41.736
- What's wrong?
- Mom, what about this guy?

20:42.554 --> 20:43.738
I don't know, honey.

20:44.106 --> 20:46.107
The fear in his eyes
is a bit of a turn off.

20:46.925 --> 20:49.092
Beat it.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.328
What about that guy
over there?

20:50.396 --> 20:51.929
Hey, you!
Don't worry.

20:51.997 --> 20:53.398
I'm gonna find a guy
that makes you happy.

20:53.465 --> 20:56.333
Okay.

20:56.401 --> 20:58.768
He seems to be
getting better.

20:58.836 --> 21:01.270
- Thanks for talking to him.
- How did you know--?

21:01.338 --> 21:04.106
Hey, I know my boy's work
when I see it.

21:04.174 --> 21:07.243
Like I always say,
thank God for my Ben.

21:07.310 --> 21:10.979
- ( Chanting ) Do the Wheeler, do the Wheeler...
- What is Riley doing?

21:11.048 --> 21:12.981
Ben: I believe it's
called the Wheeler.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.752
Well, honey, throw her a dollar.
Otherwise this is just sad.
