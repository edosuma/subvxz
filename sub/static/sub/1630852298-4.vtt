00:08.409 --> 00:09.243
JON: We're going
to have a great experience

00:09.310 --> 00:10.444
here at this homecoming.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.045
TAMI: Say it out loud.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.214
"Outlook not so good."

00:13.281 --> 00:14.814
(laughing)

00:14.881 --> 00:16.617
Some people pull a cover off,
we're playing.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.917
You guys on the floor--

00:17.984 --> 00:19.687
Oh, yeah, and that's
what a rapist says, too.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.091
You had no right
to classify me as a rapist.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.359
David, I came here
'cause I wanted to heal.

00:25.425 --> 00:28.329
I think everybody wants
to say, "Can we have a redo?"

00:28.396 --> 00:30.330
TAMI: If I could go back,

00:30.397 --> 00:33.134
there'd be a lot of things that
all of us would do differently.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.069
- I know.
- I love you, baby.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.103
IRENE: It's all right.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.470
TAMI: The moment with David

00:37.537 --> 00:39.539
would be nonexistent

00:39.606 --> 00:41.408
if Tami wasn't fucked-up,
mentally.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.143
And it just went unaddressed,

00:43.210 --> 00:44.612
it just went ignored.

00:44.677 --> 00:46.780
I don't let people in,
and there's a reason for that.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.615
I'm sorry that
you feel that way,

00:48.682 --> 00:50.084
because I do care.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.719
Well, I don't fuck
with y'all like that.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.322
Am I still a virgin?
Yes.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.290
I would like for you to get
some pussy before you die.

00:57.357 --> 00:58.558
Huh? Excuse me?

00:58.625 --> 01:00.661
IRENE: Not even been
with him all these years

01:00.728 --> 01:02.396
I can tell
that kind of language

01:02.463 --> 01:03.796
would make him feel
uncomfortable.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.834
IRENE: David filled up
his water bottle with this.

01:08.968 --> 01:11.305
You get the green apple, bitch.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.906
- Dave...
- My name is not Dave.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.775
Oh, yeah, that's right,
Dominique.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.076
Dave, do you remember throwing
something at me tonight?

01:17.144 --> 01:18.712
DAVE: You know you're
my replacement, right?

01:22.849 --> 01:24.784
TAMI: This is the true story...
- JON: True story! (chuckling)

01:24.852 --> 01:26.420
JON: Of seven strangers.

01:26.486 --> 01:27.688
BETH S: Take two!

01:27.754 --> 01:29.289
Who moved back into a house...

01:29.356 --> 01:31.158
IRENE: And have their
lives taped again.

01:31.224 --> 01:33.493
DAVID: Guess who's back!
Find out what happens...

01:33.561 --> 01:35.295
BETH A: When people stop being
polite...
- Shut up!

01:35.362 --> 01:36.364
GLEN: And start getting real.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.765
West side!

01:37.831 --> 01:41.301
IRENE: The Real World
Homecoming: Los Angeles.

("Smile" by Valerie June)

01:42.936 --> 01:46.274
* Well, I dusted off *

01:46.340 --> 01:50.510
* Guess I'll get back up *

01:50.578 --> 01:54.548
* When the times got tough *

01:54.615 --> 01:56.683
How's he been?
Does he have no clue?

01:56.750 --> 01:59.319
I don't think he remembers
anything from last night.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.820
- Which is good.
- (laughing)

02:00.888 --> 02:03.191
I think that David
has been through a lot

02:03.257 --> 02:07.795
and I think he's been
through more than we all.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.798
We may not know everything
that David has been through

02:10.864 --> 02:14.935
and I just wanna support
David and lift him up.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.837
BETH S: So how did you
and your ex Kenny meet?

02:17.905 --> 02:21.108
I went to a birthday party
for one of the New York Knicks

02:21.175 --> 02:22.842
and Kenny was there

02:22.909 --> 02:24.545
and I didn't know
who he was

02:24.611 --> 02:26.514
and he walked up on me,
and he was like,

02:26.579 --> 02:27.914
"I'm Kenny Anderson."

02:27.980 --> 02:30.651
BETH S: You're like, mm-hmm?

02:30.717 --> 02:32.520
JON: Everybody seems
to be in a good mood.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.722
We should still enjoy this time.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.223
I'd love to live with each
other without everybody

02:36.289 --> 02:37.557
getting into a big fight.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.126
JON: And then?

02:39.192 --> 02:41.161
He said, "You don't know me?"
and I said, "No, I don't."

02:41.228 --> 02:42.962
And he said, "You must
be living in a cave."

02:43.030 --> 02:44.731
- "Where you from?"
- Oh, wow.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.598
And I said
"I'm from LA,"

02:45.665 --> 02:47.200
and he's like "Okay."

02:47.268 --> 02:48.536
and so we got in the car

02:48.602 --> 02:49.836
and we went to this hot spot

02:49.902 --> 02:51.838
and we be sitting
there having dinner

02:51.905 --> 02:53.873
with a friend of his
and just talking

02:53.941 --> 02:56.810
so this lady gets up
she's like... (gasps)

02:56.877 --> 02:58.145
And so he goes, "Damn,

02:58.211 --> 02:59.979
shit, I don't feel like
being bothered tonight."

03:00.046 --> 03:02.115
The lady walks up to the table,

03:02.181 --> 03:03.751
and she goes,

03:03.817 --> 03:06.586
"Excuse me, Tami
from The Real World?"

03:06.653 --> 03:07.788
(all laughing)

03:07.854 --> 03:09.021
You got him, you got him.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.025
- TAMI: And he went...
- BETH S: What?

03:13.627 --> 03:14.694
- JON: He didn't know.
- He didn't know.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.229
Oh, my god.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.531
He had no idea of anything

03:17.598 --> 03:18.899
that I was doing.
He's like,

03:18.966 --> 03:20.268
"So what is it that you do?"
You know...

03:20.334 --> 03:21.701
And he looked
at his friend, he said,

03:21.769 --> 03:23.371
"This gonna be my wife."

03:23.437 --> 03:24.437
(Beth S gasps)

03:24.504 --> 03:25.906
- BETH S: Really?
- Wow.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.609
The last few days
have been super stressful,

03:28.675 --> 03:32.579
so it's nice to be
laughing and having fun.

be front center.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.524

out of your beach house

experience."

03:54.001 --> 03:56.804
(cheering and whooping)

03:56.870 --> 03:59.539
What? No way.

03:59.606 --> 04:00.873
(cheering)

04:00.941 --> 04:02.209
DAVID: Never been
on a yacht before.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.943
One of my fantasies
is to be on a yacht.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.280
- IRENE: Love it!
- Yes!

04:06.347 --> 04:07.615
Awesome!

04:07.681 --> 04:08.848
GLEN: When I hear yacht,

04:08.915 --> 04:11.018
I'm having flashbacks
to Cozumel.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.455
GLEN:
Beth, you're an idiot actor.

04:15.522 --> 04:18.125
- You're so pathetic, man.
- Whoa, slow down.

04:18.190 --> 04:21.428
Unfortunately, when
the seven of us get together,

04:21.495 --> 04:23.230
at least one person

04:23.297 --> 04:24.898
has to get into an argument
with somebody else.

04:24.964 --> 04:26.334
Do you understand that, Jon?

04:26.399 --> 04:28.502
Shut up and don't talk
to me in that tone of voice.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.137
I thought it was a great time.

04:30.202 --> 04:32.072
- True story!
- (laughing)

04:32.139 --> 04:33.240
JON: I don't have
a ton of money.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.975
I'm living paycheck
to paycheck

04:35.042 --> 04:37.610
and so that word, "luxury,"
is really standing out.

04:37.677 --> 04:40.947
Finally, we get treated
like the stars that we are.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.617
Who can complain
about a-- a yacht?

04:43.683 --> 04:44.685

04:47.120 --> 04:48.656
Come on Tami,
living large.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.257
I'm coming, I'm coming.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.459
TAMI: I wonder how many
bedrooms it got, though.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.661
That's what I really--

04:54.728 --> 04:56.363
I really do
want to know that.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.064
You know--

04:58.130 --> 04:59.800
People say stuff
is luxury

04:59.867 --> 05:02.403
and then it's, like,
I don't really know,

05:02.470 --> 05:04.004
am I gonna have my own bed,

05:04.071 --> 05:06.206
are we gonna be sleeping
in cabins together?

05:06.273 --> 05:09.209
Is it like a full size?
Is it a dinghy?

05:09.276 --> 05:11.411
You know, it's like,
I don't know what

05:11.478 --> 05:13.346
we're really getting ready
to get into.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.081
Is this a boat hat?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.817
I'm afraid it's gonna be
too windy for this.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.386
These my yacht pants.
You like my yacht pants?

05:18.451 --> 05:19.786

JON: I do.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.254
Oh, that'll be good,
that'll be good.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.290
That's cute
and it'll keep the sun off.

05:23.356 --> 05:24.725
- Yeah, keep the sun off--
- Yeah.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.225
- That's right?
- Yeah, that's cute.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.026
Cool.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.327

gorgeous than this, Irene?

I see several boats out there.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.692
And I don't know which one
we're going to.

05:59.759 --> 06:00.860
BETH S: Oh, wow,
look at the boat.

06:00.927 --> 06:01.894
- Look at the yacht.
- TAMI: Oh...

06:01.961 --> 06:03.564

06:03.630 --> 06:04.898
* Like, there go 1,000 *

show it then throw it like *

06:35.228 --> 06:36.829
Okay!

right on the bed.

I'm here for it.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.016
I mean, for some reason,

06:56.082 --> 06:57.183
I feel like we've
earned this.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.552
- BETH S: Yeah.

better about life now.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.156
- (laughing)
- TAMI: It was shaky.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.293
I feel like I can move forward,

07:06.358 --> 07:08.862
absorb the energy
from the moment,

07:08.928 --> 07:11.464
and have a good time, finally.

TAMI: When we walked up
to the boat,

07:33.620 --> 07:35.355
it just brought back
memories of me and Kenny...

07:35.422 --> 07:36.856
- Aw.
- ...and that felt weird.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.091
Yeah.

my husband

07:39.026 --> 07:40.293

07:40.360 --> 07:43.697
"It reminds me of when
I got married to Kenny

07:43.764 --> 07:45.499
and we were on the yacht."

"But you know what?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.100
"I'm ready to make
new memories."

"You better."

- You better.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.692
IRENE: Back in the day

08:12.759 --> 08:14.728
I was coming
onto the show

08:14.795 --> 08:15.896
to get married
for the first time

08:15.963 --> 08:18.565
and I introduced you
and Jon

08:18.632 --> 08:20.266
and Beth and Tami

08:20.332 --> 08:21.668
and Erin and Dom
at that time

08:21.735 --> 08:23.103
to Tim.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.805
That's Tim, my fiancé.

08:25.872 --> 08:26.874
- Tim...
- Nice to meet you.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.009
I didn't share with you guys.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.679
I was actually married
before I came on the show.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.181
What?

08:34.246 --> 08:35.548
I married my
high school sweetheart

08:35.615 --> 08:37.417
right out of high school.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.152
So I was already a divorced
woman coming into the show.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.587
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

08:40.653 --> 08:41.754
I didn't tell any of you guys

08:41.822 --> 08:42.889
and I don't know why I didn't.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.959
Maybe I was just embarrassed

08:46.025 --> 08:47.927
that I had been married before.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.461
What? Why
were you embarrassed?

08:49.528 --> 08:50.998
Because I was coming
onto the show

08:51.063 --> 08:53.265
as a engaged person

08:53.332 --> 08:54.835
who was planning a wedding...

08:54.902 --> 08:56.736
So the producers had no idea
that you were married before?

08:56.803 --> 08:58.038
- Nope.
- Okay.

08:58.105 --> 08:58.905
Shall I tell them the truth?

08:58.971 --> 09:00.006
Ah, it's a Vegas wedding.

09:00.072 --> 09:00.908
Who cares, right?

09:00.974 --> 09:02.042
That one didn't count.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.243
- Oh my God.
- That one didn't count.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.912
So what happened with Tim

09:04.977 --> 09:06.113
and how'd that play out?

09:06.178 --> 09:07.748
That lasted nine years.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.216
I love him to this day.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.650
He's a great father

09:10.717 --> 09:13.120
but we really didn't
have a whole lot in common.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.688
I didn't want another divorce.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.057
Of course not.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.457
But I did it because
I didn't want my kids

09:18.524 --> 09:20.793
to grow up in a house
with no love.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.062
I did not want that.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.463
TAMI:
She's gone through marriages

09:24.530 --> 09:25.899
that have not worked out

09:25.966 --> 09:27.835
and I can relate
to that because,

09:27.900 --> 09:29.201
you know,
with my first marriage,

09:29.269 --> 09:32.105
you know, sometimes
the love is all good.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.040
all there,
it's all pleasant.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.375
And then, all of a sudden,

09:35.442 --> 09:37.144
one day you wake up
and things have changed

09:37.210 --> 09:38.311
and people have changed,

09:38.378 --> 09:40.681
which ultimately
leads to divorce.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.850
Um, and then I married

09:43.917 --> 09:46.552
my, technically,
third husband.

09:48.688 --> 09:51.991
So that was in, uh, 2004,

09:52.058 --> 09:53.760
I got married.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.062
And you stayed married how long?

09:55.128 --> 09:58.831
13 years.
I just didn't want to...

09:58.899 --> 10:01.668
get another divorce.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.171
But I couldn't do it anymore.

10:04.236 --> 10:06.038
I tried for 13 years.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.275
I was not gonna stay

10:09.341 --> 10:11.278
just for the sake of staying.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.413
So I made a huge decision
to, uh, leave.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.283
I can't imagine
how painful that was.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.854
It felt very, very alone.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.154
I want to teach my daughter that

10:22.221 --> 10:23.657
she only needs
to get married one time.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.325
I didn't want to go
to my parents and say,

10:25.392 --> 10:27.059
"Oh, my God,
I'm getting another divorce.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.595
This is gonna be my third one.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.996
I was 50.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.831
I just turned-- well, 49...
- Right.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.165
...turning 50.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.134
I didn't want to go back
into that dating scene

10:35.201 --> 10:37.470
And I don't want
to start all over again.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.905
No.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.106
Cause each time
you lose your home

10:40.173 --> 10:41.875
you lose your security...
- Right.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.744
You lose a lot
of your friends.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.712
You feel like a failure,

10:45.778 --> 10:47.213
but at the same time too,

10:47.279 --> 10:50.149
I was not going to stay

10:50.216 --> 10:52.184
just for the sake of staying.

10:52.251 --> 10:53.986
BETH S: So how long ago
did you get divorced?

10:54.053 --> 10:56.588
In 2017 it was final.

10:56.655 --> 10:58.057
BETH A: Okay.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.027
IRENE: But it led me
to something way better.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.394
BETH A: Talk about that.

11:01.461 --> 11:05.298
It led me to my fourth husband

11:05.365 --> 11:08.969
Phil, and to the life
that I really,

11:09.035 --> 11:10.102
really was looking for.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.705
BETH S: Yeah.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.706
Back in '93
I moved into the house

11:13.774 --> 11:15.241
as an engaged woman.

11:15.307 --> 11:17.043
- What do you do?
- I'm a deputy marshall.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.110
Remember "Night Court"?

11:18.177 --> 11:19.913
All rise.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.248
That was me.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.482
So I protected the judge,

11:23.549 --> 11:26.552
protected the DA,
protected the inmate,

11:26.619 --> 11:27.988
the public.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.355
Because of holding the gun

11:29.422 --> 11:31.423
I had surgery on my shoulder.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.860
I was forced to retire.

11:33.927 --> 11:34.794
I loved my job.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.096
I'd still be doing it today.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.201
But now I run
my own business

11:41.268 --> 11:42.936
and it's a health
and wellness company.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.871
This is Lisa and Kristin.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.073
They are my business partners.

11:47.139 --> 11:48.808
Then one day
my girlfriend says

11:48.875 --> 11:52.211
"Why don't you go on this
dating app called Bumble?"

11:52.278 --> 11:55.481
I saw this handsome man
with blue eyes.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.616
He brought me flowers and wine

11:57.683 --> 12:00.888
and he was the perfect
gentleman

12:00.953 --> 12:03.791
and we've been together
since December 2017.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.259
I couldn't be happier.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.928
We travel together.
We eat together.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.697
Very intelligent man.

12:10.764 --> 12:11.899
I love his children

12:11.965 --> 12:14.167
and the best part of it all

12:14.234 --> 12:16.235
is that my kids love him.

12:16.302 --> 12:19.505
My daughter told me
just a few days ago.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.274
"I want to have
what you and Phil have."

12:22.341 --> 12:25.111
Boy, that brings joy
to a mom.

12:25.177 --> 12:26.947
JON: Irene, I've never
seen you happier

12:27.014 --> 12:28.315
than you have been with Phil.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.416
- And you met him.
- I met him, yeah.

12:29.481 --> 12:30.850
I met your last three.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.786
(laughing)

12:32.852 --> 12:34.653
TAMI: So much information

12:34.721 --> 12:37.423
is coming out
with these people,

12:37.490 --> 12:40.360
Irene sitting up
at the table talking about

12:40.427 --> 12:42.562
she been married
four times

12:42.629 --> 12:44.730
and then she lied
to get on the show

12:44.798 --> 12:46.533
and said she
was already married--

12:46.599 --> 12:48.034
You know, like, it's a lot.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.102
DAVID: Sometimes you gotta
keep digging, digging,

12:50.169 --> 12:51.638
digging until
you find that gold.

12:51.703 --> 12:53.072
Oh, yeah, you do.

12:53.139 --> 12:56.442
He's my soulmate and
I'd marry him 100 times over.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.245
IRENE: Back in '93,
I got married on the show.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.782
What better way
to celebrate my new marriage

13:02.850 --> 13:06.886
than to renew our vows
here on this beautiful yacht.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.456
Phil and I already had
planned to renew our vows

13:10.523 --> 13:14.561
and to have Jon be the one
to perform the ceremony.

13:14.626 --> 13:16.263
And doing it
on this yacht

13:16.328 --> 13:17.429
with my roommates,

13:17.496 --> 13:19.932
why wouldn't
I take this opportunity?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.836
I am going to be completely
honored when you do this.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.904
- It's a huge honor.
- That's so sweet.

13:24.971 --> 13:25.772
Thank you.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.308
Jon is, like,
one of my best friends

13:29.375 --> 13:31.711
and in 2008

13:31.778 --> 13:34.246
I wanted him
to officiate my wedding

13:34.313 --> 13:35.782
but he said no

13:35.849 --> 13:39.052
and so I just don't understand
why it's okay to officiate

13:39.119 --> 13:41.120
the ceremony with Irene

13:41.187 --> 13:43.123
but it wasn't okay

13:43.190 --> 13:45.557
to, like, do it for me
in real life.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.794
I mean, did she even invite him
to any of her multiple weddings?

13:50.096 --> 13:51.331
I don't think so.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.100
Well, cheers to that.

13:53.165 --> 13:58.071
Cheers to a long, happy,
healthy marriage.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.739
GLEN: Is this too far for him
to swim out here though?

13:59.806 --> 14:01.274
(laughing)

14:04.878 --> 14:06.578
* *

14:18.357 --> 14:19.893
BETH A: I'm gonna hop out
real quick.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.094
BETH S: You're what?

14:21.161 --> 14:21.961
I'm just gonna
hop out for a second.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.196
Yeah.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.097
I've had a few
experiences so far

14:25.164 --> 14:28.567
with David vaping and blowing
stuff directly in my face.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.004
- BETH S: You okay?
- I have 34 years clean.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.871
I don't want second-hand
inhalation, that's all.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.307
So how do we handle that?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.375
I don't want him smoking weed
at the table later.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.743
I don't wanna
smell that shit.

14:36.808 --> 14:38.245
I've been in recovery
for a really long time.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.513
There's a lot of situations
where people do smoke weed

14:40.580 --> 14:41.813
and I just--
I just removed myself.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.816
Try not to make
a big deal out of it.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.586
I'm not comfortable
losing my recovery.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.988
Yeah.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.222
So and I don't know enough
about vaping to know,

14:50.289 --> 14:52.359
but I just don't
want to chance it.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.793
- That's my choice.
- Yeah, okay.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.229
But I'm-- I'm good.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.698
Thank you Beth for caring
about me, but I'm all right.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.302
BETH S: David, do you mind just
not smoking weed at the table?

15:03.370 --> 15:04.770
I'm not smoking.
It's my tobacco.

15:04.836 --> 15:06.038
Well, whatever
you're smoking.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.006
It's my tobacco.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.341
Well, whatever it is, it's--

15:10.076 --> 15:12.845
My daughter told me to move and
watch out for your fucking ass.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.147
We're all sitting here eating.
That's all.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.715
My daughter was right.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.750
I'm still gonna give Beth
the side-eye, though.

15:18.817 --> 15:20.787
When she's in the hot seat,
she'll say anything.

15:20.852 --> 15:22.221
Yeah, I know.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.791
Like you said,
first Karen, for real.

15:24.856 --> 15:26.458
First Karen...

15:26.525 --> 15:28.061
It's been a heavy process
for me, though.

15:29.861 --> 15:32.664
My daughter was right,
keep an eye on your ass.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.669
So can you go tell Beth
her meal is ready

15:37.736 --> 15:38.937
and I'm waiting
for her to eat.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.340
BETH S: She said she wanted
to take a break.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.709
She said she doesn't
want us to inhale fumes.

15:42.774 --> 15:44.543
DAVID: I wish we could
do confessionals.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.379
I want to have confe--
I got some shit to say.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.514
TAMI: What you wanna say?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.783
Oh, nothing, it's just
between me and the confession.

15:50.850 --> 15:51.850
Mm-hmm.

15:59.259 --> 16:02.294
My daughter told me to not
trust you and watch out for you.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.431
So leave me alone, please.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.033
I don't know
why you're getting...

16:06.099 --> 16:08.034
- Okay!
- you're getting upset about it.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.402
Okay, I'm not upset, I'm--

16:09.469 --> 16:12.371
Hey, Karen, Karen, Karen,
please, leave me alone.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.374
David, let's not do that one.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.375
Thank you, Karen.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.051
DAVID: I don't know
why you picking with me.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.284
- Tami had a cigarette,
- I'm not picking on you.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.552
and you bowed
and didn't say shit.

16:30.389 --> 16:33.092
I'm smoking my vape
and you up my ass.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.326
- Karen.
- So, hey...

16:34.394 --> 16:36.562
Hold on,
this between me and Karen.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.929
David.

16:37.996 --> 16:40.332
Better speak
up for yourself, Beth.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.734
DAVID:
And let me alone, please.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.003
Please, I beg you.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.672
- BETH S: Hey, David.
- Please let me alone.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.139
- Just, hey, can we just eat?
- Please, leave me alone.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.341
Okay, I'm just gonna eat.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.341
You don't need
the back and forth.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.442
Thank you.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.178
JON: To be honest,
I support Beth S

16:52.245 --> 16:53.846
because it's inconsiderate.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.847
Everybody at the table

16:55.914 --> 16:57.750
should not have
to inhale your chemicals

16:57.817 --> 16:59.318
because
you've developed a habit.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.830
IRENE: I was afraid
to say anything.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.700
BETH A: I'm not used to people
smoking at the table.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.835
[exhales sharply]

17:15.902 --> 17:17.136
Good.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.073
This is a huge meal.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.407
IRENE: Look how pretty it is
over there.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.875
I know, everything
is so gorgeous.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.512
BETH A: That was-- I feel weird
not cleaning dishes tonight.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.548
I feel so spoiled.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.682
* *

17:32.352 --> 17:34.052
- BETH A: Hey, Tami.
- TAMI: Hey.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.088
- Hey, there.
- (laughing)

17:36.155 --> 17:38.625
- What are you eating?
- Some steak.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.059
- Oh!
- I saw that.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.096
I'm developing a relationship
with Chef Alex.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.132
(laughing)

17:45.198 --> 17:46.398
BETH A: Always--

17:46.465 --> 17:47.900
That's a good relationship
to have on this.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.102
Always on it.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.136
IRENE: I gotta get
some more wine.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.105
- TAMI: Double up.
- Yep.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.406
BETH A: You got Beth
to the power of two here.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.642
What's going on?

17:55.708 --> 17:57.743
Well, the little
conversation that happened

17:57.809 --> 17:59.045
at the table about the smoker.

17:59.112 --> 17:59.945
- Uh-huh.
- Mm.

18:00.011 --> 18:01.181
TAMI: I wanna hear

18:01.248 --> 18:02.882
what you guys
have to say about this.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.017
I have 34 years clean
and sober

18:05.084 --> 18:07.686
and my drug of choice
was marijuana.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.721
You think it's mari--
'Cause he said it's tobacco.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.758
BETH A: I don't want
to risk my recovery.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.727
I don't know when and
what he's doing with what

18:14.794 --> 18:17.997
because I have been exposed
several times to both things

18:18.064 --> 18:20.299
and I've been
in group settings

18:20.366 --> 18:21.701
long enough to know
something's bothering me.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.002
I can just get up
and quietly walk away

18:24.069 --> 18:28.240
and I wasn't trying to make
a big deal out of anything.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.210
I know you might have had
a different reaction,

18:30.277 --> 18:32.044
but I just was like, "I'm gonna
step away for a minute."

18:32.111 --> 18:33.480
I should just sit here
for the rest of the time

18:33.546 --> 18:35.382
and not say anything,
because when I--

18:35.448 --> 18:37.317
anytime I say something

18:37.384 --> 18:39.318
people have a problem with it.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.587
So how the hell am I supposed
to talk about anything?

18:41.653 --> 18:43.756
BETH A:
You're less discreet, though.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.358
Like, I quietly slipped away.

18:46.425 --> 18:49.028
I didn't see him
address you.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.563
I saw him specifically
address you.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.730
Yeah.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.732
And I think that
where his concern lies

18:53.799 --> 18:55.634
is that I am a smoker too.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.304
Yeah. Yeah.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.339
Not once has anybody said,
"Uh, Tami."

19:00.406 --> 19:03.576
So I didn't know if they
were just picking on David.

19:03.643 --> 19:07.480
Just trying
to trigger him in some way.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.048
The difference is
you're respectful.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.616
Like, when we were driving
in the car

19:10.682 --> 19:12.318
you were, like, holding
it out the window

19:12.384 --> 19:15.054
and blowing your smoke
out the window.

19:18.156 --> 19:21.027
But when David
is in the car, he blows it.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.694
And it was going to me

19:22.761 --> 19:25.597
and that's why I asked him, can
you please not vape in the car?

19:25.664 --> 19:28.201
I've talked to David
several times

19:28.268 --> 19:31.170
about when we are together
as a group

19:31.238 --> 19:34.874
and we're forced
to sit in a car together.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.107
I'd really love it

19:36.174 --> 19:37.576
if you wouldn't
blow smoke in my face.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.810
BETH A: Wooh!

19:38.877 --> 19:40.145
It smells like smoking.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.847
BETH S: David, we don't
want to smell smoke.

19:41.913 --> 19:44.683
Tami is very courteous smoker.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.920
David has no courtesy
for anybody.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.289
It's just not cool.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.692
I don't care what he does
if I have to sit there

19:52.759 --> 19:55.295
at the table when we're
all sitting there to eat dinner.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.064
I don't want to have
smoke blown in my face.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.499
And just because I asked him,

19:59.566 --> 20:01.334
can you please
not vape at the table?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.536
He got mad
and called me names.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.105
You can't-- I can't even
have a discussion with him.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.906
This this isn't
about an intervention

20:07.973 --> 20:09.008
for David or judging you.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.176
Here we are again
trying to address

20:11.243 --> 20:14.846
just the easiest thing.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.214
So...

20:16.282 --> 20:18.384
That's why I wanted
to talk to y'all first.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.920
'Cause, like, if Beth is really
just picking on David...

20:20.987 --> 20:22.121
No!

20:22.188 --> 20:23.522
Look, he's triggered.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.826
I wonder why that is.
Like, why it's...

20:26.893 --> 20:28.760
You, specifically, I wonder.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.061
I don't know.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.663
- 'Cause there's something...
- It's about me.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.532
- Yeah, with you two...
- With me, yeah.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.468
...that it's just--
it's like--

20:35.535 --> 20:37.068
Yeah.

20:37.135 --> 20:39.137
I mean, I-- I don't want him

20:39.204 --> 20:40.606
to have any--
zero problem.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.107
I'm gonna go have
a conversation with him.

20:42.173 --> 20:43.174
BETH S: Okay.

20:43.241 --> 20:46.244
I-- I don't have
any explanation

20:46.313 --> 20:49.449
for why whenever
people are trying

20:49.516 --> 20:51.451
to have a conversation
with David,

20:51.518 --> 20:55.054
it has to turn into
a full blown argument

20:55.121 --> 20:57.088
outside of the fact

20:57.155 --> 21:00.092
that he's not
willing to receive

21:00.159 --> 21:01.993
and try to understand

21:02.060 --> 21:03.596
what anyone else is saying,

21:03.663 --> 21:05.464
except what he thinks
and feels.

21:05.531 --> 21:08.367
- I appreciate your mediation.
- (Tami laughing)

21:08.434 --> 21:10.236
When you're not open

21:10.303 --> 21:12.739
then, of course,
you're going to be defensive,

21:12.805 --> 21:15.607
which, ultimately,
ends up in everybody

21:15.674 --> 21:17.876
just being at odds
with each other.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.413
And I'm just tired.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.182
I'm just tired of having
those type of conversations.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.852
Hey.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.185
Hey, what's up, T?

21:27.252 --> 21:29.321
- How you doing?
- Chilling.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.723
So I want to come
check on you.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.426
I'm good.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.827
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.397
I had a conversation
with the Beths

21:38.464 --> 21:40.767
about what happened at dinner.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.035
I genuinely believe
that she was not

21:43.102 --> 21:45.337
trying to come for you.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.473
I genuinely believe,
based on what they...

21:47.539 --> 21:49.275
- You know what?
- ...explained...

21:49.342 --> 21:51.042
I'm not trying to
fucking get angry.

21:51.109 --> 21:52.578
I'm sitting here,
down here.

21:52.644 --> 21:53.480
No, that's why I'm saying,
I don't want you to get angry.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.947
Trying to keep it calm.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.348
Everybody's like, "No,
she's not coming for you."

21:56.415 --> 21:58.351
Well, I feel that
she was coming for me.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.519
What is it with her?

21:59.586 --> 22:00.420
What is it with her
that you--

22:00.487 --> 22:01.921
I don't trust the bitch.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.390
I don't trust her.

22:03.455 --> 22:06.092
Don't wait till the camera
crew is all around

22:06.157 --> 22:07.960
and make a big
fucking scene.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.060
What she did tonight,

22:09.127 --> 22:10.128
the way she went about it.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.196
She trying
to start some shit

22:11.262 --> 22:12.163
and that's why
I asked her

22:12.230 --> 22:13.098
leave me the fuck alone.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.300
Well, let me say this,

22:15.367 --> 22:17.303
you might feel
because you're vaping

22:17.369 --> 22:18.605
and it is--

22:18.671 --> 22:20.172
I was the only
one smoking, vaping?

22:20.239 --> 22:22.375
- No, no, no, well, vaping--
- Why am I being singled out?

22:22.442 --> 22:24.644
I don't know what
her fucking problem is,

22:24.711 --> 22:26.578
I'm surprised
she bringing this shit up.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.615
No, I brought it up,
I brought it up.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.450
Okay, well maybe it's
a boring slow news night...

22:30.517 --> 22:33.251
- No, I brought it up--
- But, listen, guys, guys, guys.

22:33.318 --> 22:35.622
I need this. I need everybody
to leave me the fuck alone.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.856
- Please.
- How we-- how we
gonna co-exist, then?

22:37.923 --> 22:39.826
- Please.
- ...if you don't want nobody
talking to you.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.027
I'm not trying-- No.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.260
I'm not gonna sit
and argue with nobody.

22:42.327 --> 22:43.962
I'm down here chilling
by myself

22:44.029 --> 22:45.832
and you're all trying
to kick up some shit.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.366
Maybe it's a boring--
it's boring night,
y'all need some drama?

22:48.434 --> 22:49.935
TAMI: David, we're all
here to talk about stuff.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.503
DAIVD: Okay, guys,
I'm telling you-- Beth--

22:51.570 --> 22:53.640
Beth don't want none of this.
I'm trying to be cool.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.842
TAMI: So why you not-- why
are you not willing to do that

22:55.907 --> 22:58.376
from a mature standpoint?
- DAVID: Oh, Lord.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.413
That's why we're here for.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.013
DAVID: Does Beth
really want this?

23:02.080 --> 23:04.282
TAMI: Beth ain't got nothing to
do with what I'm talking to you.

23:04.349 --> 23:06.519
DAVID: Y'all talking, stirring--
Watch out, watch out,
stirring the pot!

23:06.586 --> 23:08.921
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm trying to have a
conversation with you--

23:08.988 --> 23:11.222
DAVID: You're gonna follow me
all over the motherfucking boat?

23:11.289 --> 23:12.625
TAMI: I am, and it's shaky.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.226
Y'all gonna keep
fucking with the bear, huh?

23:14.292 --> 23:15.595
I'm down here chilling,

23:15.662 --> 23:16.929
y'all down here
fucking with me.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.865
TAMI: Yeah, but you're
not engaging with us.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.500
I'm talking to you
about this situation.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.834
Okay, uh, no, no, no,
I-- I need a time out.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.068
I don't care,
there is no situation.

23:23.134 --> 23:24.671
Everything's fine,
everything's peachy.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.872
TAMI: You didn't give me
a chance to say--

23:25.938 --> 23:27.373
DAVID: I am not making up
with Beth again.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.075
TAMI: You gonna stop
fucking talking.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.910
DAVID: I don't mind if I don't
make up with Beth again.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.845
TAM: I've been very nice
and respectful to you

23:32.912 --> 23:34.614
but you're not extending
that to me.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.315
DAVID: Goddamn it, everybody,
what the fuck?

23:36.382 --> 23:38.049
What is wrong with y'all?

23:38.116 --> 23:39.486
What is wrong with you?

23:39.551 --> 23:41.353
I'm trapped in a boat full
of married fucking women.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.690
- What is wrong with you?
- Move your married ass on
somewhere else.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.192
TAMI: I'm annoyed.
(chuckles)

23:46.258 --> 23:48.326
I'm annoyed, I'm annoyed,

23:48.394 --> 23:50.229
'cause that ain't
gonna go nowhere.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.663
(sighs)

23:53.766 --> 23:57.135
* *

23:57.202 --> 23:59.838
DAVID: Good morning,
I feel good, I'm having coffee.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.474
So here I am,
on this boat

24:02.541 --> 24:03.742
and I'm--I'm not gonna lie,

24:03.809 --> 24:06.077
it's been
a challenging experience.

24:06.144 --> 24:10.148
I have been hurt by Beth S.

24:10.215 --> 24:11.518
And for her to come for me

24:11.584 --> 24:14.385
and try to, you know,
whatever her excuse is,

24:14.452 --> 24:15.954
I'm not playing it.

24:16.021 --> 24:20.326
David really feels like Beth
has put a target on his back

24:20.392 --> 24:23.229
and it's just Beth S,

24:23.295 --> 24:24.963
as far as he's concerned.

24:25.030 --> 24:29.401
My philosophy is don't
start none, won't be none.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.304
I get frustrated
because it's like, well,

24:32.371 --> 24:33.806
why did I come here

24:33.873 --> 24:35.441
if we're not going
to talk through stuff,

24:35.508 --> 24:37.175
and if people
aren't going to be willing

24:37.242 --> 24:39.778
to address the things
that are bothering them?

24:39.846 --> 24:41.180
I don't want to talk about it,

24:41.247 --> 24:42.882
but don't come for me.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.250
Don't do that.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.684
So we--
(boat horn blaring)

24:45.751 --> 24:47.486
So we-- Ooh, shit,
that scared the shit out of me,

24:47.554 --> 24:49.622
out here on this water.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.423
We'll see what today holds.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.724
Try to see what else
ain't nobody gonna

24:52.791 --> 24:54.192
talk about in this house.

24:54.259 --> 24:57.128
* *

24:58.664 --> 25:00.031
WOMAN: Incoming message.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.104
- Mm.
- Incoming message.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.272
BETH A: They followed us
all the way out here.

25:07.338 --> 25:09.275
(laughing)

25:09.340 --> 25:12.545
GLEN: "In 1993, many of you
considered yourselves

25:12.612 --> 25:14.012
'too young' to settle down.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.748
"One of you, however,
entered the house

25:15.815 --> 25:18.317
"with one foot
in 'The Real World'

25:18.384 --> 25:23.255
and the other foot
in a different kind
of reality: commitment."

25:23.321 --> 25:24.624
That's Tim, my fiancé.

25:24.691 --> 25:25.991
Are we gonna come
to the wedding?

25:26.057 --> 25:27.594
- Yes, of course you are.
- Oh, all right!

25:27.660 --> 25:29.060
GLEN: You're going
to miss it, you are.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.029
You're gonna miss Jon,
Jon is gonna miss you.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.664
BETH S: He actually
wanted to cry

25:32.731 --> 25:34.432
because Irene was leaving.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.868
IRENE: Jon said the cutest
thing the other day.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.038
"Irene, don't marry Tim,
marry me."

25:39.105 --> 25:39.971
(laughing)

25:40.038 --> 25:42.040
Did I say that?

25:42.107 --> 25:44.977
From the first day
Irene moved into the house.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.913
She has been
organizing this wedding.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.213
Oh, my gosh.

25:48.279 --> 25:49.848
(sighs)

25:49.915 --> 25:53.152
I just feel mentally
and physically exhausted.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.520
I'm never going
to get married again.

25:55.587 --> 25:57.288
(laughing)

25:57.355 --> 25:58.590
(all laughing)

25:58.657 --> 25:59.826
- Well...
- Well...

25:59.892 --> 26:01.693
PRIEST: Timothy and Irene,

26:01.760 --> 26:03.128
you have come together
in this church,

26:03.194 --> 26:05.463
now I ask you to please
join your right hands

26:05.530 --> 26:08.067
and repeat after me...

26:08.134 --> 26:10.036
IRENE: Watching the clip,

26:10.102 --> 26:11.569
I just see my kid's dad.

26:11.637 --> 26:13.338
PRIEST: And now
it is my pleasure

26:13.404 --> 26:15.507
to introduce to this
wonderful group of people

26:15.574 --> 26:18.009
Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Kerns.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.145
(applause)

26:22.114 --> 26:24.817
BETH S: We were giving Jon
a really hard time

26:24.884 --> 26:27.886
because he was so sad
that day.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.454
BETH A: And he was in love
with all the qualities

26:29.520 --> 26:33.224
that Irene possessed and
he wants a girl just like her

26:33.291 --> 26:34.160
and she's gone now.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.694
(laughing)

26:35.761 --> 26:37.997
Wow, why do people
call you the drama queen?

26:38.064 --> 26:39.632
I don't know.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.067
* *

26:46.038 --> 26:49.107
IRENE: Watching that, um, back

26:49.174 --> 26:51.509
brought back
some good memories.

26:51.576 --> 26:54.445
That was a good day,
it was a happy day.

26:54.512 --> 26:55.714
Famous last words.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.083
"I'm never gonna get
married again."

26:57.148 --> 26:58.851
Yeah, videotape is harsh,
isn't it?

26:58.917 --> 27:00.686
IRENE: Yeah, dang,
they got that on tape.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.121
- JON: That was special, though.
- IRENE: Yeah, it was.

27:02.188 --> 27:05.057
It got me pretty emotional,
seeing that.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.894
Because you want it
to be your last marriage

27:08.961 --> 27:10.528
and I had children with him.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.064
I was sad when you left.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.565
Not because you fell in
love with me.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.933
Not because I fell
in love with you.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.103
But you'd be a good one
to fall in love with.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.938
- Aww.
- I was sad that
you were leaving,

27:19.005 --> 27:21.973
but I was also looking
the way I was looking,

27:22.040 --> 27:24.143
I think, because
I was carsick.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.477
(chuckles)

27:25.544 --> 27:27.046
Because I had ridden
with Beth in LA traffic

27:27.113 --> 27:30.115
and I-- when I don't sit
in the front seat or drive.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.317
I get really sick.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.019
Let's face it,
she's a beautiful person.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.586
But at her wedding
I rode there with Beth S,

27:35.653 --> 27:36.756
who can't drive
a stick shift car

27:36.823 --> 27:38.289
and I was so sick.

27:38.356 --> 27:39.525
But then everybody was like,

27:39.590 --> 27:40.459
"Oh, you're in love
with her"

27:40.526 --> 27:42.094
and that was fine.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.931
I mean, I wasn't, like, upset
that people said that.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.032
I think Jon was
attracted to her

27:47.098 --> 27:50.936
but he doesn't talk
about that kind of stuff.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.105
The truth of matter is that
I was really carsick.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.707
(chuckles)

27:54.773 --> 27:55.907
DAVID: When I got married
it was a shotgun.

27:55.974 --> 27:57.343
(imitates gun clicking)

27:57.409 --> 27:58.576
Come on, boy.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.511
I met my daughter's mom,

28:00.578 --> 28:02.413
a great young woman,
and one day--

28:02.480 --> 28:04.215
It was the perfect timing.

28:04.282 --> 28:06.417
She was like, "David,
if you don't marry me,

28:06.484 --> 28:08.086
you're going to lose me."

28:08.153 --> 28:10.689
And I went, "You know what?
You're right."

28:10.757 --> 28:12.523
My ex-wife,
my daughter's mom,

28:12.590 --> 28:14.861
you know, we're still very
close, I love her to this--

28:14.926 --> 28:16.194
She's an awesome,
awesome woman.

28:16.261 --> 28:18.096
She holds me accountable
and she has my back.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.633
I'm happy that I waited

28:21.700 --> 28:24.170
and waited to have kids
at a later date,

28:24.236 --> 28:26.704
and hopefully
we'll be together forever.

28:26.772 --> 28:29.607
We just celebrated our
13-year anniversary.

28:29.674 --> 28:31.109
Where you stressed
about the wedding

28:31.176 --> 28:32.744
when you were doing
all the planning?

28:32.811 --> 28:34.313
I mean, you saw me.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.082
I mean, I was sad because...

28:36.147 --> 28:39.117
Jon didn't come to my wedding,
so that made me sad.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.720
- He was supposed to marry us.
- GLEN: Why? Why didn't he?

28:41.788 --> 28:43.189
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.156
- Why didn't he?
- Well, a couple of reasons.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.259
One, at that point
I've never done one

28:47.326 --> 28:50.028
and also my mentor at
the time, who was my pastor,

28:50.096 --> 28:54.432
I said, "Hey, my friend wants
me to perform her wedding"

28:54.500 --> 28:57.103
and he said, "Well,
which friend? Who is it?"

28:57.169 --> 28:59.070
and I said, "Well,
she lives in California."

28:59.137 --> 29:00.739
I was on the show with her
and he goes, "Oh, okay."

29:00.807 --> 29:01.973
"Well, do you know her husband?"

29:02.040 --> 29:03.843
I said, "No,
I've never met her husband

29:03.910 --> 29:05.443
or her fiancé."

29:05.510 --> 29:07.880
He said "Well, I would encourage
you to probably not do that."

29:07.946 --> 29:09.214
"You've never met her husband

29:09.280 --> 29:11.450
"so you don't know
if that's going to be

29:11.517 --> 29:15.320
"a union that-- that, you know,
is ordained by God or not."

29:15.386 --> 29:16.488
And I said, "Well..."

29:16.555 --> 29:18.124
I mean, I've been
married once in my life.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.724
- Yeah.
- It's okay for you
to marry Irene

29:19.791 --> 29:21.192
who's been married four times,

29:21.259 --> 29:22.661
but it's not okay
to marry me?

29:22.728 --> 29:23.628
IRENE: You know what?

29:23.694 --> 29:25.196
If you had a problem with it,

29:25.263 --> 29:26.632
maybe you should have
taken him to the side.

29:26.698 --> 29:29.167
So what
if I'm married four times?

29:29.234 --> 29:31.670
I don't think
she should compare me to her.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.204
She should just be happy for me.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.540
- I'm not marrying her.
- Well, whatever.

29:35.606 --> 29:36.909
It's just confusing to me.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.243
I don't understand
why you could do it for her

29:38.309 --> 29:39.677
and not for me.

29:39.744 --> 29:42.013
DAVID: Beth S,
she is an opportunist

29:42.080 --> 29:44.782
and she has the amazing talent

29:44.851 --> 29:47.886
to always be in
the middle of somebody's shit.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.689
I didn't officiate her ceremony.
She's married.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.790
This is a celebration
of that today.

29:52.858 --> 29:55.060
BETH S: It makes me feel sad.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.829
You know, I'm hurt because
I just don't understand

29:57.896 --> 30:01.000
why he it would be
okay for him to officiate

30:01.067 --> 30:03.734
for Irene, who's been married
multiple times

30:03.801 --> 30:06.005
but then to, like,
kind of judge me

30:06.071 --> 30:08.539
when I'm getting married
and, like,

30:08.606 --> 30:10.108
I'm still married.

30:10.175 --> 30:12.845
And I've only been married
one time.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.913
All right.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.555
BETH S: I still,
you know, Irene--

30:23.622 --> 30:25.356
IRENE: There's still
some pain there.

30:25.423 --> 30:26.758
Yeah, there's
still some pain there.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.961
I would think that Jon
knows me well enough

30:29.028 --> 30:32.298
to know that, like,
if I'm gonna marry someone...

30:32.364 --> 30:36.134
it's something
that I take very seriously.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.536
I just don't get it.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.337
I don't understand
what the difference is here.

30:40.739 --> 30:43.075
Because you told me that
you didn't think that I had

30:43.142 --> 30:45.010
a place in my life for God.

30:45.076 --> 30:47.346
- Wait, what?
- Just because
I don't go to church--

30:47.413 --> 30:50.016
No, because every time
in last 30 years...

30:50.082 --> 30:51.549
What?

30:51.616 --> 30:52.951
JON: ...that we talked about
the Lord you said,

30:53.019 --> 30:54.685
"Yeah, I don't--
that's not part of my life."

30:54.752 --> 30:56.587
So that tells me that,
you know...

30:56.654 --> 30:59.557
- BETH S: Okay.
- God has no big
huge place in your life.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.426
- Okay.
- And, listen--

31:01.492 --> 31:03.328
Well, it hurts my feelings
that you're judging me
about that.

31:03.394 --> 31:04.762
Well, I'm sorry--
I'm not judging you.

31:04.829 --> 31:06.731
- You are judging me.
- But I'm really, really careful

31:06.798 --> 31:08.067
about what I do in ministry.
- But you are-- Okay.

31:08.134 --> 31:10.469
I take it very seriously,
if that makes sense.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.903
You're talking about
specifically, like,

31:11.971 --> 31:13.605
when you're handling
the marriage

31:13.672 --> 31:15.707
and not the renewing
of the vows.

31:15.773 --> 31:17.143
- Yeah.
- That's two different things.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.644
Very much very different things,
very different things.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.546
BETH S: It hurt my feelings

31:20.612 --> 31:22.780
that not only did
you not marry us,

31:22.847 --> 31:24.650
you didn't--
you didn't show up.

31:24.715 --> 31:26.884
TAMI: Beth is your friend,
your real-life friend,

31:26.952 --> 31:28.554
you--you could have
attended the wedding.

31:28.619 --> 31:29.887
There's a lot of people
weddings

31:29.955 --> 31:31.823
that I've gone to
that I don't know nothing about.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.459
I don't even know
the bride or the groom.

31:33.525 --> 31:34.692
I might be friends
with the bridesmaid

31:34.759 --> 31:36.327
and I show up at the wedding

31:36.394 --> 31:37.895
'cause they're gonna have some
good food and some good drinks.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.965
JON: You know, a lot of
times you don't want to say,

31:40.031 --> 31:41.732
"Hey, I don't have the money
for this," cause pride sets in.

31:41.799 --> 31:43.368
I'm having to explain myself.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.636
I was unable to come
for a variety of reasons.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.705
One doesn't have to do
with the other.

31:47.772 --> 31:49.641
Let's celebrate
Irene and Phil today.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.542
And I'm sorry that I didn't
come to your wedding.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.311
But I think it's time to build
a bridge and get over it.

31:53.378 --> 31:54.546
- Yeah.
- Honestly.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.448
I feel like
I could totally understand

31:56.515 --> 31:58.217
if I were in that position,

31:58.284 --> 32:00.486
but I don't think I would
bring it up at that moment.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.653
I would renew your vows with
your husband today.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.190
I love him,
he treats you great.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.391
I love your whole family.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.359
Today's about
Irene and her husband.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.529
- TAMI: Okay, so the bridge
is built?
- BETH S: Yeah.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.699
Then that's what it is.

32:13.765 --> 32:14.967
Okay.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.335
So I need to get dressed.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.237
And this time I get
to be here.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.570
- IRENE: That's right!
- Yeah.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.406
I'm very happy
that you're here to see this.

32:21.472 --> 32:24.309
I'm feeling like I'm getting
this moment hijacked by Beth.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.876
All right, let's go.

32:25.943 --> 32:29.015
And I don't think
that's fair.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.882
But then again, that's Beth.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.921
* *

32:38.957 --> 32:40.125
How you feeling?

32:40.192 --> 32:42.161
You know,
when you get married

32:42.228 --> 32:45.364
you in-- you invite people

32:45.431 --> 32:46.897
from different stages
of your life,

32:46.964 --> 32:49.268
and Jon was one
of those people.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.737
I didn't have my father
to walk me down the aisle.

32:51.802 --> 32:53.771
- Right.
- And so it was very--

32:53.838 --> 32:55.641
- That's real.
- It was really
an emotional time for me.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.375
So my mom walked me
down the aisle

32:57.442 --> 32:58.844
and then when I got
to the end

32:58.910 --> 33:01.747
I wanted to see Jon
marrying the two of us.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.148
BETH A: Right, he's one of the
stable men in your life.

33:03.214 --> 33:04.615
Yeah.

33:04.682 --> 33:06.417
I just scrambled
to find somebody else.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.487
I'm sorry.
That's sticky.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.691
I can see how this hurts Beth,
knowing who Beth S. is.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.559
She's only been married once,

33:14.625 --> 33:16.561
she's raising her children
in the same house,

33:16.627 --> 33:18.829
she's going by the books
on everything, like,

33:18.896 --> 33:20.566
what you would think it's
supposed to look like

33:20.632 --> 33:22.468
if you're following
God's word

33:22.534 --> 33:26.672
and yet she's watching who she
thinks is one of her best
friends

33:26.738 --> 33:28.773
renew vows for someone who's
on her fourth marriage,

33:28.839 --> 33:31.009
and it crushed her.
She didn't understand.

33:31.076 --> 33:34.413
I'm keeping it here,
I'm keeping it here.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.347
That's where
I'm keeping it, right here.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.817
I was hoping that Beth would
move on from the situation.

33:38.884 --> 33:41.119
I'd like to focus on today.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.355
Let's celebrate
Irene and Phil today.

33:43.422 --> 33:45.824
I'm excited for her wedding.

33:45.891 --> 33:47.425
Oh, my gosh,
we're going to have

33:47.492 --> 33:49.427
the best day ever on a boat.
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.

33:49.494 --> 33:50.996
JON: I'm getting
ready to do this.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.463
Now we're gonna get Phil

33:52.530 --> 33:53.898
to come out and get on
the boat with us

33:53.964 --> 33:56.768
and meet the whole
houseload of people.

33:56.835 --> 33:59.938
For me to be able to officiate
this renewal of the vows

34:00.005 --> 34:01.106
is pretty cool.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.773
It's going to be
a great day on this boat.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.843
And I'm excited
for Phil and for Irene

34:04.910 --> 34:06.511
and it's gonna be awesome
and I can't wait.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.315
I don't want
to ruin Irene's day.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.581
This is her special day,

34:10.648 --> 34:13.119
and I'm ready for
the festivities to begin.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.856
When you think
you're gonna be married

34:17.922 --> 34:20.226
to that one person forever,

34:20.291 --> 34:22.594
you don't want to be
a failure, because
that's what I felt like.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.695
You gotta look at
yourself to say,

34:24.762 --> 34:27.965
"What am I doing wrong with
myself?"

34:28.032 --> 34:28.867
And it's working.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.306
BETH S:
Wanna wear my diamond earrings?

34:34.373 --> 34:36.175
- You have diamond earrings?
- Yeah, you wanna wear them?

34:36.242 --> 34:37.909
- Yeah.
- Okay.

34:37.976 --> 34:39.744
That would be nice, 'cause
you have to wear diamonds
on your wedding.

34:39.811 --> 34:40.846
Something borrowed,
something blue.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.648
I have never felt
so loved before

34:43.715 --> 34:45.583
until I met Phil.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.485
BETH A: Okay.

34:47.552 --> 34:48.987
I know this
isn't the first time...

34:49.054 --> 34:50.255
(Irene laughing)

34:50.322 --> 34:51.922
...but it's still--
you got the jitters?

34:51.989 --> 34:53.724
IRENE: It's not my first
rodeo, yeah, of course I do.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.594
I just feel
like I was blessed

34:55.661 --> 34:57.463
to have this man in my life.

34:57.528 --> 35:00.798
And I think I've led this
whole life just to get to him.

35:00.865 --> 35:04.802
Hey, Phil, welcome
to our humble abode.

35:04.869 --> 35:07.172
- JON: It is a nice boat.
- PHIL: Yeah, it is.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.673
There and Irene...

35:08.739 --> 35:10.309
It's an honor for me to be
able to do something

35:10.376 --> 35:11.943
for Irene and her husband today.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.378
I just really appreciate her.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.746
We've been friends for 30 years.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.648
We're gonna be friends forever.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.083
This is a good way for me to

35:18.150 --> 35:20.152
give back to
the friendship a little bit.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.653
How's that?

35:22.721 --> 35:24.422
- Looks great to me.
- (laughing)

35:24.489 --> 35:25.523
- Well done, sir.
- All right.

35:25.590 --> 35:26.958
Man, I haven't
done that before.

35:27.025 --> 35:28.427
- So far we're good.
- Yeah.

35:28.494 --> 35:29.695
(laughing)

35:31.096 --> 35:32.063
Hi.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.931
This is Beth
and this is Beth.

35:33.998 --> 35:35.099
- PHIL: Hi, Beth,
hi, Beth, how are you?
- JON: This is Tami.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.501
TAMI:
Hi, nice meeting you, Phil.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.336
TAMI: The first time
we went to Irene's wedding,

35:38.403 --> 35:40.838
we were just spectators.

35:40.905 --> 35:42.641
Now we can
be a part of the moment.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.074
JON: Glen, this is Phil.

35:44.141 --> 35:45.677
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.711
- David.
- Hey, David.

35:46.777 --> 35:48.547
How are you, sir?

35:48.614 --> 35:50.548
You lucky motherfucker.
(laughing)

35:52.418 --> 35:53.918
* *

35:57.322 --> 35:59.358
IRENE: I love Phil

35:59.425 --> 36:02.661
and I had to go through all
that shit with my marriages,
in the past

36:02.728 --> 36:05.130
to realize what
an awesome person

36:05.197 --> 36:06.297
that I have
in front of me.

36:08.032 --> 36:10.568
- Hi, baby.
- Are you ready?

36:10.635 --> 36:12.070
- I'm ready again
- PHIL: I'm ready.

36:12.137 --> 36:14.005
Well, this is very exciting,
we're here to celebrate

36:14.072 --> 36:17.108
Irene and Phil,
they're renewing their vows.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.644
IRENE: Phil is supporting
and loving.

36:19.710 --> 36:22.748
And the way
he loves my children.

36:22.813 --> 36:25.650
And the way
my mom and dad love him,

36:25.717 --> 36:27.853
I just feel so lucky.

36:27.918 --> 36:29.788
It's a really special day
on a beautiful place

36:29.855 --> 36:31.257
with wonderful friends.

36:31.322 --> 36:34.092
IRENE: I'm just very grateful
to be here with Phil.

36:34.159 --> 36:36.695
Love is patient,
love is kind.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.097
It does not envy,
it does not boast.

36:39.164 --> 36:41.800
Love keeps no record
of wrongs.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.702
- Irene.
- Yes!

36:43.768 --> 36:46.003
I love you with
everything I have

36:46.070 --> 36:48.407
each and every day
I'm so proud

36:48.474 --> 36:49.807
to call you my husband.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.077
I look forward to all
of the future adventures

36:52.143 --> 36:53.844
and continuing
to take care of each other

36:53.911 --> 36:56.882
for the rest of this adventure
that we are on together.

36:56.947 --> 36:59.351
JON: Well, you guys can kiss.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.324
(laughing)

37:07.157 --> 37:08.126
Whoo!

37:09.394 --> 37:10.461
- I love you, honey.
- I love you, too.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.130
Thank you for being here.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.199
BETH A: So we just want to know
if you get to have

37:14.266 --> 37:15.867
a honeymoon tonight
on this boat.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.737
- JON: Oh, Lord.
- I'll show you where
it's gonna take place.

37:18.804 --> 37:19.670
Okay, well, they're gonna be
a little busy.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.039
JON: Oh, Lord.

37:21.106 --> 37:22.541
IRENE: I think we should
do that once a year.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.342
Oh, okay.
Not always on TV, though.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.177
No, no, not always on TV.

37:27.713 --> 37:30.014
* *

37:30.081 --> 37:32.016
IRENE: Thank you, it's pretty,
take a picture of that.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.353
To the bride and groom.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.586
- Oh, thank you.
- Cheers.

37:35.653 --> 37:36.887
BETH S: To the bride and groom.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.456
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.559
- Thank you, Jon,
for our ceremony.
- JON: Man, my pleasure.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.159
Not just a great idea,
but a great job.

37:42.226 --> 37:43.461
Thank you, sir.

37:43.528 --> 37:46.130
So you think that I would
be cleaning the kitchen?

37:46.197 --> 37:48.534
- This one right here...
- Is the kitchen cleaner?

37:48.599 --> 37:50.034
He is the kitchen cleaner.

37:53.771 --> 37:54.606
Glen, you doing
the dishes again?

37:54.672 --> 37:56.007
(laughing)

37:56.074 --> 37:57.976
Well, Irene's been
gone for a while, Glen.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.577
So if you don't
mind stopping by.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.313
(laughing)

38:01.380 --> 38:03.148
I asked him, "Honey,
do you have made the bed?"

38:03.213 --> 38:05.617
- PHIL: No.
- IRENE: No.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.652
GLEN: When she was telling me
different things about you,

38:07.719 --> 38:09.855
I was really blown away.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.789
GLEN:
Irene renewed her vows,

38:11.856 --> 38:12.690
it's a great thing.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.360
I love when people move on

38:14.425 --> 38:17.963
and actually finally find the
person that makes them happy.

38:18.028 --> 38:20.498
It's just discussions
we're having,

38:20.565 --> 38:21.500
they're triggering me.

38:21.567 --> 38:23.835
Kim, who was my second--

38:23.902 --> 38:25.436
I say she's my second wife.

38:25.503 --> 38:26.771
We weren't legally married.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.106
She died.

38:28.172 --> 38:30.007
- Oh.
- GLEN: Yeah.

38:30.074 --> 38:33.411
Discussions we're having
might have nothing to do--

38:33.478 --> 38:35.614
You wouldn't think it would
have anything to do with it,
but I'm triggered.

38:35.681 --> 38:39.451
Losing her was not easy.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.853
BETH S: Sorry, I didn't know
that your wife passed away.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.188
- Yeah.
- How long ago was that?

38:43.253 --> 38:45.356
- GLEN: Two years ago.
- Oh, my goodness.

38:45.423 --> 38:47.425
- It was an illness?
- BETH S: Oh, my gosh.

38:47.492 --> 38:48.994
I would say, yeah.

38:50.596 --> 38:53.998
When she died,
love died.

38:54.065 --> 38:57.568
IRENE: Glen is opening up to us
about his ex-girlfriend,

38:57.635 --> 38:59.670
but he isn't coming out
and actually saying

38:59.737 --> 39:01.873
what happened.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.476
I hesitated about even wanting
to bring this up

39:04.543 --> 39:08.045
because it's hard
working through the Kim stuff.

39:08.112 --> 39:09.947
Did you guys have kids
together or no kids?

39:10.014 --> 39:11.449
She couldn't have kids.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.117
I think that was part of--

39:13.184 --> 39:16.086
uh, part of one of the things
that hurt her a lot.

39:16.153 --> 39:20.090
Basically what
happened was, um...

39:20.157 --> 39:22.561
she wasn't herself anymore.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.028
She didn't feel like...

39:24.094 --> 39:27.032
she was living fully,
you know?

39:27.097 --> 39:30.101
BETH A: I'm proud of Glen for
talking about what's really
going on.

39:30.168 --> 39:33.038
He's giving
such small pieces and bits.

39:33.103 --> 39:35.673
I think it's been incredibly
difficult for him to talk about,

39:35.740 --> 39:37.476
even though I know the story.

39:37.543 --> 39:40.311
I'm waiting for him to share

39:40.378 --> 39:43.114
fully what's been
happening for him.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.559
Ready, smile.
Oh, you look amazing.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.793
- (boat horn blaring)
- GLEN: Yeah, whoo!

39:57.728 --> 39:59.297
TAMI: It's beautiful up here,
but it's bright.

39:59.364 --> 40:00.398
DAVID:
T, can I share with you?

40:00.465 --> 40:01.467
Mm-hmm.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.068
I'm glad you calmed down.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.403
Do you know why
you reacted that way?

40:06.472 --> 40:07.873
With Beth?

40:07.938 --> 40:10.509
When she acted that way,
I was just like

40:10.576 --> 40:12.478
I couldn't believe it.

40:12.543 --> 40:14.913
I have serious
trust issues with Beth S.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.648
- Shut the fuck up!
- Why you did that to her?

40:16.715 --> 40:18.215
- Shut the fuck up!
- Don't talk to me, David.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.818
- I do have common courtesy!
- Okay, hold on one second--

40:19.885 --> 40:21.186
Which you shoved down
my throat!

40:21.251 --> 40:23.554
DAVID: The issue of
the vaping and cigarettes.

40:23.621 --> 40:25.356
I didn't feel like
I owed Beth any kind

40:25.422 --> 40:26.958
of explanation
at the table.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.059
TAMI: Do you think you want
to have a conversation with her

40:29.126 --> 40:30.695
to-- to say that?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.130
- Then you'd feel
better about it.
- It's a possibility, yeah.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.398
You know what I'm saying?
You'd feel better about it.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.400
Can you agree to stop
calling her Karen?

40:35.467 --> 40:36.934
(chuckling)

40:37.001 --> 40:39.369
- No, that's my golden line.
- No.

40:39.436 --> 40:42.474
I decided to pull
them both upstairs

40:42.541 --> 40:44.275
because I really
wanted us all

40:44.342 --> 40:46.376
to have a good time
on this boat.

40:46.443 --> 40:49.447
They need to discuss
what was going on

40:49.514 --> 40:51.382
with them and hopefully
can mend fences.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.585
- How's it going?
- It's going.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.219
I just had a great
conversation with David.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.253
BETH S: Oh, good.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.123
Today he's
in a better place

40:58.188 --> 41:00.525
to be able to receive
and have a conversation.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.092
- Okay.
- Do you want her to start?

41:02.159 --> 41:03.695
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.831
I don't want to add
any stress to your life at all.

41:05.896 --> 41:09.668
I'm just asking you, can you
just be considerate...

41:09.735 --> 41:10.835
(grunts)

41:10.902 --> 41:12.637
...and not blow smoke in my
direction

41:12.704 --> 41:13.871
if we're at a place--

41:13.938 --> 41:15.541
like right now,
I could go over there.

41:15.606 --> 41:16.641
If you're smoking,
Tami is smoking.

41:16.708 --> 41:17.442
If I want,
I can go over there.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.210
It's not smoke.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.913
Well, whatever it is, David.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.282
He felt like it was, like,
put out on Front Street, right?

41:25.349 --> 41:26.617
'Cause we were
all at the table.

41:26.684 --> 41:28.887
- ...jump in the ocean.
- David, do you mind

41:28.954 --> 41:30.420
just not smoking weed
at the table?

41:30.487 --> 41:32.891
I honestly felt if you would
have pulled me to the side,

41:32.958 --> 41:35.025
and done that out of respect.

41:35.092 --> 41:37.027
It's the point with all
the cameras around

41:37.094 --> 41:39.264
and I'm mic'd up and
you're doing that extra shit,

41:39.329 --> 41:40.931
it really annoyed me.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.735
I'm not asking
you to not smoke

41:43.802 --> 41:45.903
because the cameras
are there.

41:45.971 --> 41:47.739
Anybody has the right
to do what they want to do.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.775
I'm just not interested
in somebody blowing smoke

41:50.842 --> 41:54.179
directly into my face
with the intent to piss me off.

41:55.746 --> 41:57.615
I'm sorry for the tone
that I used

41:57.682 --> 42:00.050
and I apologize, I--

42:00.117 --> 42:02.588
Yeah, I still have,
like, flashbacks

42:02.653 --> 42:05.489
of you taking
my Timberland boots

42:05.556 --> 42:06.925
all around the toilet
and paper.

42:06.992 --> 42:08.326
I have trust
issues with you,

42:08.393 --> 42:11.061
You've came for me
several times, not just here.

42:11.128 --> 42:14.465
You came after me again
in Jamaica with Puck...

42:14.532 --> 42:17.869
Uh, excuse me, Puck
just spit in my face,
disqualification.

42:17.936 --> 42:20.137
If he ain't gone,
I'm going home myself.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.472
- Puck.
- What's up?

42:21.539 --> 42:23.141
Bad news: you gotta go home.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.309
BETH S: David should be getting
kicked off before Puck.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.478
WOMAN: If Puck goes,
we all go.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.916
We get off the bus because
we don't want Puck to leave.

42:30.981 --> 42:33.117
Why do y'all still
have this man's back?

42:33.184 --> 42:36.722
If I spat somebody's face, I
would be gone, and I know this.

42:36.788 --> 42:38.824
And I'm sorry,
you know, again.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.692
You know, I do forgive you,
but there are some--

42:40.759 --> 42:42.760
BETH S: Did you think I'm
responsible for you leaving
the challenge?

42:42.827 --> 42:44.195
(clears throat)
There are--

42:44.262 --> 42:45.896
- I didn't--
- If I can just finish my
speech

42:45.963 --> 42:46.831
- Yes, yes.
- ...that would be so cool.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.199
Go ahead,
I'm listening.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.001
No disrespect towards you,
that's why--

42:50.068 --> 42:53.070
But, I mean, if you're
going to call me names...

42:53.137 --> 42:53.972
I mean that's not--

42:54.039 --> 42:55.340
I'm not calling you names.

42:55.405 --> 42:56.507
DAVID: You have in the past.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.208
You've called me rapist.

42:58.275 --> 43:00.077
I used it as an analogy.

43:00.144 --> 43:01.346
Irene said it too.

43:01.411 --> 43:03.849
For whatever reason
that doesn't affect you.

43:03.914 --> 43:07.351
Why are you okay with Irene,
but you're not okay with me?

43:07.418 --> 43:11.657
Your track record against me--
it's not good.

43:11.722 --> 43:13.291
I was just trying to talk
to you about it.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.293
But it's how you went about it.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.561
I was like, "No, this can't be.

43:16.628 --> 43:17.862
She can't be coming
for me again."

43:17.929 --> 43:19.597
When I let my guard down,

43:19.664 --> 43:21.331
Let-- let your guard
down with what?

43:21.398 --> 43:23.101
- Against all of women's advice.
- 'Cause I asked you
not to vape?

43:23.168 --> 43:24.302
It's nothing personal.

43:24.369 --> 43:26.371
When you let--
willing to let me talk

43:26.436 --> 43:27.773
and stop fucking
cutting me off,

43:27.838 --> 43:28.940
- I shall return.
- BETH S: Okay.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.507
DAVID:
I'm taking a time out 'cause

43:30.574 --> 43:32.110
I'm trying to stay calm

43:32.177 --> 43:33.844
while smoothing things
over with Beth.

43:33.911 --> 43:38.315
And that's all I can do,
because I've had it.

43:38.382 --> 43:39.751
I'm done.

43:41.318 --> 43:44.521
Can we agree to just be kind
and cordial to one another

43:44.588 --> 43:47.324
and be nice and sweet?

43:47.391 --> 43:48.626
- I'm all for.
- Okay.

43:48.693 --> 43:49.827
Please.

43:49.894 --> 43:51.762
- Okay.
- We got a beautiful

43:51.829 --> 43:52.998
stuff to do today.

43:53.063 --> 43:55.701
- Yeah.
- Let's just move on.

43:55.766 --> 43:58.103
* We both know that you *

43:58.168 --> 43:59.871
It's all good.

43:59.938 --> 44:02.106
We're on this beautiful boat,
let's enjoy it.

44:02.172 --> 44:03.708
Yeah.

44:03.775 --> 44:07.012
* Please don't believe her *

44:07.077 --> 44:09.681
When you go downstairs,
pick up the eggshells

44:09.748 --> 44:11.516
that you got
everybody walking on.

44:11.581 --> 44:14.085
- Oh, wow.
- (chuckles)

44:14.152 --> 44:16.286
- I wish.
- Pick those up
when you go downstairs.

44:16.353 --> 44:18.724
* Non-believers *

44:18.789 --> 44:21.092
* Don't believe her, no *

JON: True story!

44:31.836 --> 44:33.003
I wanna dedicate this

44:33.070 --> 44:34.940
to my roommates
that are here tonight.

you tonight.

BETH S: Ooh!
Joshua Tree!

44:40.411 --> 44:42.547
- Namaste.
- TAMI: Nah, a mistake.

44:42.612 --> 44:44.081
(laughing)

44:44.148 --> 44:47.351
WOMAN: An opportunity to get
in touch with the third eye.

ALL: Party like it's 1993!

JON: You know what this means.

44:52.489 --> 44:55.059
- BETH S: What?
- JON: It's over.

44:55.126 --> 44:56.693
I stood up there and
was brave enough

44:56.762 --> 44:58.663
to represent our community
in a time when nobody was.

44:58.730 --> 45:00.297
And that's fact.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.666
- It's the Gibster.
- GLEN: There's your mom.

45:02.733 --> 45:04.402
I've never felt
like I was a girl.

45:04.469 --> 45:07.739
I don't like being
in this body,

45:07.806 --> 45:09.039
I don't like it.

45:09.106 --> 45:11.476
- JON: Oh, my.
- IRENE: Shit, what?

45:11.541 --> 45:13.677
- BETH S: What?
- This is a can of worms.

45:13.744 --> 45:15.847
I've been raised
being exposed

45:15.914 --> 45:18.282
and being allowed to have
friendships with everybody.

45:18.349 --> 45:20.451
You don't understand
what I'm saying to you

45:20.518 --> 45:22.753
that the words should not come
out your white-ass mouth.

45:22.820 --> 45:24.155
Do not ever say that.

45:24.222 --> 45:25.690
You were gone for a minute,

45:25.757 --> 45:28.226
but you know Tami's husband came
here today, looking for you.

45:28.293 --> 45:29.994
- TAMI: Uh-oh.
- David!

45:30.061 --> 45:31.329
TAMI: Where he at?

45:31.396 --> 45:33.231
REGGIE: Anybody want me
to leave, make me leave.

45:33.297 --> 45:35.065
So someone's up here,
irate, looking for me?

45:35.132 --> 45:36.201
Yeah.

45:36.266 --> 45:38.036
Am I hearing this
fucking correctly?

45:38.103 --> 45:39.304
What'd you say
about my daughter?

45:39.369 --> 45:40.838
Let's have a conversation.

45:40.905 --> 45:42.072
(phone dialing)

45:42.139 --> 45:43.273
Uh, it's David,
we need to talk, 911.

45:43.340 --> 45:44.775
I'm glad we keep it light
in this house.

45:44.842 --> 45:45.777
Yeah.
