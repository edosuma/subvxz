WEBVTT

00:02.841 --> 00:04.058
Look at all these people

00:04.059 --> 00:05.593
just sitting here
and not tipping,

00:05.595 --> 00:07.094
working on their computers.

00:07.096 --> 00:08.462
This guy has a brand-new Apple.

00:08.464 --> 00:11.432
I've been eating
the same apple for a week.

00:11.434 --> 00:13.167
I blame Steve Jobs.

00:13.669 --> 00:17.504
These people are more like
Steve-I-have-no-jobs.

00:17.506 --> 00:20.724
All right, that's it.

00:20.726 --> 00:22.643
Earl, I need to get
the wireless router.

00:22.645 --> 00:25.146
Oh, is that
what this is?

00:25.148 --> 00:28.983
I thought it was
a cookie-warmer.

00:29.985 --> 00:31.952
Attention deadbeat diners.

00:31.954 --> 00:33.787
You can't just sit here
all night

00:33.789 --> 00:34.855
and only order coffee.

00:34.857 --> 00:36.707
This is not a Starbucks.

00:36.709 --> 00:38.626
And I know that because
we don't sell

00:38.628 --> 00:41.795
Norah Jones CDs or bananas.

00:41.797 --> 00:44.632
This is the router
for the free Wi-Fi.

00:44.634 --> 00:47.334
And that is a waitress
who needs to make some tips.

00:47.336 --> 00:49.720
Seriously, guys,
I need actual cash.

00:49.722 --> 00:52.206
This guy just offered
to pay me in ideas.

00:52.208 --> 00:55.426
If I pull this plug,
the Internet will go down.

00:55.428 --> 00:57.845
And you--that sad email
you're in the middle of writing

00:57.847 --> 00:59.013
to your ex-boyfriend,

00:59.015 --> 01:00.898
the one you shouldn't
send anyway--gone.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.099
And you--

01:02.101 --> 01:03.934
that vaguely
pornographic anime film

01:03.936 --> 01:05.152
you've been illegally
downloading

01:05.154 --> 01:07.387
for the past three hours--
gone.

01:07.389 --> 01:09.607
And you--that screenplay
you've been writing,

01:09.609 --> 01:11.909
you can keep working on it,
but we all know how it ends:

01:11.911 --> 01:14.945
With you moving
back in with your mother.

01:14.947 --> 01:17.898
Now, who's gonna order?

01:17.900 --> 01:19.783
Great, I'll go get some menus.

01:19.785 --> 01:21.402
Here, Caroline,
put this back.

01:23.072 --> 01:26.757
Ooh, my cookie-warmer.

01:26.759 --> 01:29.276
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:30.513 --> 01:34.448
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:46.466 --> 01:49.017
Table ten
just ordered cocktails.

01:49.019 --> 01:51.936
Yeah, 'cause we're
that kind of a place.

01:51.938 --> 01:54.572
Does anyone know how
to make sex on the beach?

01:54.574 --> 01:55.940
Easy.

01:55.942 --> 01:58.743
I put on my speedo and wait.

02:03.483 --> 02:05.533
Those girls have been
drinking for hours.

02:05.535 --> 02:09.604
Just press every button
on the gun and add rum.

02:11.791 --> 02:14.125
Look at them.
Not a care in the world.

02:14.127 --> 02:15.343
Having a great time.

02:15.345 --> 02:16.660
- I hate them.
- I hate them, too.

02:16.662 --> 02:17.879
I hate them more.

02:17.881 --> 02:18.963
I hate that
you hate them more.

02:18.965 --> 02:20.081
So jealous.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.059 --> 02:32.110
Okay,
ready for party of four.

02:32.112 --> 02:33.895
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

02:33.897 --> 02:37.582
Excuse me.

02:39.251 --> 02:40.668
Hey, baby!

02:40.670 --> 02:41.753
Looking good.

02:41.755 --> 02:42.954
Mm, always.

02:42.956 --> 02:45.790
I'll be in my booth.

02:48.327 --> 02:51.195
Sophie, you cannot take up
a whole booth alone.

02:51.197 --> 02:54.165
There are people waiting.
You must leave.

02:54.167 --> 02:58.136
Go stand in the corner now!

03:04.560 --> 03:06.894
Before I bend you across
my knee and spank you

03:06.896 --> 03:09.313
in front of the whole class.

03:10.715 --> 03:15.236
Well, I was going to stand
in the corner anyway.

03:15.238 --> 03:18.239
But tomorrow night,
smaller table.

03:18.241 --> 03:21.609
Go stand in the corner now!

03:23.078 --> 03:26.664
Okay, I'm over being
jealous of them.

03:28.084 --> 03:29.750
Still? What are they--

03:29.752 --> 03:34.956
sitting on vibrators?

03:37.176 --> 03:38.509
Let it go.

03:38.511 --> 03:40.261
They're not having that
good of a time.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.913
No, Max, we're not
having that good of a time.

03:42.915 --> 03:44.248
All we do is work.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.516
When's the last time
we took a day

03:45.518 --> 03:46.684
and just had fun?

03:49.772 --> 03:51.556
I mean, those two idiots
remind me

03:51.558 --> 03:53.274
how much fun it was
when I'd go out to lunch

03:53.276 --> 03:55.092
and have cocktails
with my girlfriends

03:55.094 --> 03:57.595
and watch them pretend to eat.

03:57.597 --> 03:59.597
I think you're talking
about day-drinking,

03:59.599 --> 04:01.949
and I think I like it.

04:01.951 --> 04:04.368
All right,
let's do something fun.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.120
I'll put on my bolo tie
and my best vest

04:06.122 --> 04:09.240
and take my girl out to eat.

04:11.143 --> 04:13.828
So, what is this lunch spot
you're taking me to?

04:13.830 --> 04:15.079
Is it French?

04:15.081 --> 04:16.180
Do you think the chef
will send

04:16.182 --> 04:17.447
an amuse-bouche to the table?

04:17.450 --> 04:19.250
No,
but this morning I shaved

04:19.252 --> 04:22.336
a smiley face into my bouche,
and it's very amusing.

04:22.338 --> 04:23.337
You know what?

04:23.339 --> 04:24.972
It's just so fun
to get dressed up

04:24.974 --> 04:26.958
and have someone wait on us
for a change.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.960
I even bought new panty hose
from dooahnay rayahdey.

04:29.962 --> 04:33.147
You mean Duane Reade?

04:33.149 --> 04:35.316
Oh, is that
how you pronounce it?

04:35.318 --> 04:37.151
Well, we're here.
Better get in line.

04:37.153 --> 04:40.438
Oh, there's a line.
Popular place.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.739
What's the name?

04:41.741 --> 04:44.575
"Soup Kitchen."
That's a cute name.

04:44.577 --> 04:45.993
Very Williamsburg.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.662
Like, "let's take
our upscale urban bistro"

04:47.664 --> 04:48.913
"And make it seem like
it's just a soup kitchen

04:48.915 --> 04:49.980
"open to everyone,

04:49.982 --> 04:52.700
but it's not really
a soup kitchen."

04:52.702 --> 04:56.204
Oh, that's nice.
They let them use the bathroom.

04:56.206 --> 04:59.323
And sit at a table.

04:59.325 --> 05:01.842
Oh, my God!
This is really a soup kitchen.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.844
This is your idea
of treating me to lunch?

05:03.846 --> 05:04.845
We're not homeless.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.098
No, but we are soup-less.

05:07.100 --> 05:11.202
And it's not just
homeless people who eat here.

05:11.204 --> 05:15.006
Okay, maybe they're
the target audience.

05:15.008 --> 05:16.857
Look,
there's a lot of other people

05:16.859 --> 05:18.509
who can't afford
to go out to eat.

05:18.511 --> 05:19.477
You're right.

05:19.479 --> 05:21.145
Why are there
so many hipsters here?

05:21.147 --> 05:22.897
Because this place
isn't just for people

05:22.899 --> 05:24.031
who don't have jobs,

05:24.033 --> 05:26.367
it's for people
who don't want them.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.402
Well, it does smell good.

05:28.404 --> 05:30.521
Excuse me.

05:30.523 --> 05:32.023
We'd like to take
a look at your lunch menu.

05:32.025 --> 05:33.658
Menu changes every day.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.693
Also, there is no menu.

05:35.695 --> 05:37.078
There's, like, four things.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.580
Oh, okay.
So what do you recommend?

05:39.582 --> 05:41.532
Oh, what do I recommend?

05:41.534 --> 05:44.719
Don't share needles,
and and use condoms.

05:44.721 --> 05:46.470
But you didn't hear
that last one from me.

05:46.472 --> 05:49.724
Are nuns even allowed
to be sarcastic?

05:49.726 --> 05:52.260
If they are, I have
some serious thinking to do

05:52.262 --> 05:55.079
about my future.

06:01.587 --> 06:03.721
This sloppy Joe
is the most amazing

06:03.723 --> 06:05.957
terrible thing
I've ever eaten.

06:05.959 --> 06:08.643
I love that
it's basically pre-chewed,

06:08.645 --> 06:11.863
so all you really have
to do is swallow.

06:11.865 --> 06:13.481
So good,
I used to have these

06:13.483 --> 06:15.099
every day
when I was a kid.

06:15.101 --> 06:16.601
Well, then I guess
your childhood

06:16.603 --> 06:18.469
- wasn't all that bad.
- Mm.

06:18.471 --> 06:20.488
We couldn't afford
the real Manwich Mix,

06:20.490 --> 06:22.974
so my mom's boyfriend,
Dirty Carl,

06:22.976 --> 06:25.243
used to bring us
leftover meat scraps

06:25.245 --> 06:27.328
and then bash 'em together
with old ketchup packets

06:27.330 --> 06:29.480
he'd found in cars
at the junkyard.

06:29.482 --> 06:31.115
Now I understand
why you think

06:31.117 --> 06:33.284
this is
a nice restaurant.

06:33.286 --> 06:35.653
Have you noticed
the more you drink,

06:35.655 --> 06:36.988
the better
this place gets?

06:36.990 --> 06:38.523
I've noticed the more
I drink,

06:38.525 --> 06:40.157
the better everything gets.

06:40.159 --> 06:42.043
Why don't we
drink every day?

06:42.045 --> 06:44.662
Some of we do.

06:44.664 --> 06:46.331
I'm having a great time.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.532
Thank you, Max.

06:47.534 --> 06:48.683
Well, yesterday,

06:48.685 --> 06:50.001
you were so bummed
about your life,

06:50.003 --> 06:51.052
I thought I'd take
you somewhere

06:51.054 --> 06:52.503
you could feel good
about yourself.

06:52.505 --> 06:55.773
Okay, I've been wanting
to say this the whole time.

06:55.775 --> 06:59.477
I feel like we're the hottest
people in this room.

06:59.479 --> 07:01.479
- Is that terrible?
- Yes.

07:04.951 --> 07:08.519
Speaking of hot people...

07:08.521 --> 07:09.871
Wait.

07:09.873 --> 07:12.824
Are we drunk
or do we finally have one brain

07:12.826 --> 07:15.176
- and the same taste in guys?
- I don't know,

07:15.178 --> 07:18.162
but this is suddenly
my new favorite restaurant.

07:18.164 --> 07:20.098
Let's go get ourselves
some of that man-wich.

07:20.990 --> 07:22.734
I kind of like
"drunk Caroline" way more

07:22.736 --> 07:24.168
than the other Caroline.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.087
I kind of like her better,
too.

07:28.541 --> 07:29.924
Excuse me, sisters.

07:29.926 --> 07:31.208
Do you know the guy
who just came in here?

07:31.210 --> 07:34.445
- The cute one.
- He's so cute, right?

07:34.447 --> 07:35.596
His name is Andy,
and he just opened

07:35.598 --> 07:36.981
a candy store
across the way.

07:36.983 --> 07:39.017
Shut up!
Candy?

07:39.019 --> 07:41.269
I love candy.

07:41.271 --> 07:43.354
Question:

07:43.356 --> 07:45.389
What would make
this day even better?

07:45.391 --> 07:48.309
Candy?

07:48.311 --> 07:50.662
You should totally
go for the hot guy.

07:50.664 --> 07:52.113
Or you can go for him.

07:52.115 --> 07:53.281
Let's think about this.

07:53.283 --> 07:54.732
He's clean
and not a drug addict,

07:54.734 --> 07:56.400
so he's more my type.

07:56.402 --> 07:59.253
Well, he's got a store
full of candy and a penis,

07:59.255 --> 08:01.289
so he's more my type.

08:01.291 --> 08:02.507
You know what?

08:02.509 --> 08:04.509
Go for it.
You've got dibs.

08:04.511 --> 08:07.261
Aww, that's so nice
of you, Max.

08:07.263 --> 08:09.297
Yeah, and while you're
doing him in the back room,

08:09.299 --> 08:11.549
I'll be pocketing
some candy.

08:11.551 --> 08:14.352
Oh, no.
It's closed.

08:14.354 --> 08:16.637
Hey, Max, you
know what'd be fun?

08:16.639 --> 08:19.357
If we threw that trash can
through the front window?

08:19.359 --> 08:21.642
I was gonna say we should
leave him a note.

08:21.644 --> 08:22.894
And what would be fun about
throwing that can

08:22.896 --> 08:23.928
through a window?

08:23.930 --> 08:27.281
Have you ever done it?
It's fun!

08:27.283 --> 08:28.983
Oh, the sign's turned around.

08:28.985 --> 08:30.935
He can see us.

08:30.937 --> 08:33.270
He's smiling at us.

08:33.272 --> 08:35.106
Should we go in?

08:35.107 --> 08:36.541
If I learned anything
as a child,

08:36.543 --> 08:38.126
it's when
a stranger offers you candy,

08:38.128 --> 08:39.794
you say yes.

08:41.496 --> 08:42.914
Hi.

08:42.916 --> 08:44.882
We thought the sign
said you were closed.

08:44.884 --> 08:48.336
Yeah, I turned it around.
I wanted you guys to come in.

08:50.073 --> 08:51.756
♪ Come with me

08:51.758 --> 08:53.474
♪ and you'll be

08:53.476 --> 08:57.795
♪ in world
of pure imagination ♪

08:57.797 --> 08:59.297
If this isn't
your thing,

08:59.299 --> 09:02.233
I also have some Sabbath
and some Beastie Boys.

09:02.235 --> 09:05.436
So, if this is "Candy Andy's
Sweets and Treats,"

09:05.438 --> 09:07.405
are you Candy Andy?

09:07.407 --> 09:09.574
Oh, please.
We hardly know each other.

09:09.576 --> 09:11.976
Call me Candrew Andrew.

09:11.978 --> 09:15.446
I'm Caroline,
and this is Max.

09:15.448 --> 09:17.115
Max, say something.

09:17.117 --> 09:20.985
Can't.
It's all too wonderful.

09:20.987 --> 09:24.088
Look at all the candy crammed
in this little space.

09:24.090 --> 09:28.509
It's like we're inside
Willy Wonka's colon.

09:28.511 --> 09:29.844
Thanks.

09:29.846 --> 09:31.546
Yeah, it's kind of
the look I was going for too.

09:31.548 --> 09:32.880
And I know it's accurate

09:32.882 --> 09:34.799
because I had
the Oompa Loompas help me.

09:34.801 --> 09:35.933
They were expensive,

09:35.935 --> 09:39.403
but what are you gonna
doom-pa-dee-doo?

09:39.405 --> 09:41.172
Normally I'd ring the bell
after something that golden,

09:41.174 --> 09:42.440
but I don't want to scare you.

09:42.442 --> 09:44.442
Well, now I have
to hear the bell.

09:44.444 --> 09:47.061
♪ Anything you want to

09:47.063 --> 09:49.380
Now that's all
I want to hear.

09:49.382 --> 09:51.149
Do you do free samples?

09:51.151 --> 09:53.401
You do, by the way.

09:53.403 --> 09:55.620
Let me hook you guys up.
On the house.

09:56.905 --> 09:59.023
Marry this guy right now.

09:59.025 --> 10:02.293
It's a small store.
I can hear you.

10:02.295 --> 10:04.912
Good.
Moves things along faster.

10:04.914 --> 10:06.697
Hey, come by
the Williamsburg diner sometime.

10:06.699 --> 10:07.765
We work there.

10:07.767 --> 10:08.900
We'll give you
free samples of food

10:08.902 --> 10:11.636
you shouldn't
have to pay for anyway.

10:11.638 --> 10:13.738
So, what brings you
in to this neighborhood?

10:13.740 --> 10:16.040
-Oh, we were having lunch
at the--

10:16.042 --> 10:18.509
this ...is a really adorable space.

10:18.511 --> 10:19.594
Thank you.

10:19.596 --> 10:21.546
You know, candy is my passion.

10:21.548 --> 10:23.881
Yeah, I said it.
Always has been.

10:23.883 --> 10:25.766
Even as a kid,
I would have my G.I. Joes

10:25.768 --> 10:29.687
sell sweet tarts
to my Transformers.

10:29.689 --> 10:32.490
Gum drops, gummy bears,
gummy worms,

10:32.492 --> 10:34.408
gummy hot dogs,
gummy pizza.

10:34.410 --> 10:37.445
Ooh, I just had a gummy-gasm.

10:37.447 --> 10:39.163
So what was
your favorite candy as a kid?

10:39.165 --> 10:41.999
Actually, I didn't eat
a lot of candy as a child.

10:42.001 --> 10:44.902
Okay, I'm gonna overlook
that because you're pretty,

10:44.904 --> 10:47.438
but maybe we could talk
about your terrible childhood

10:47.440 --> 10:49.740
over coffee sometime.

10:49.742 --> 10:51.142
Yeah?

10:53.546 --> 10:54.712
I'd leave you two alone,

10:54.714 --> 10:56.881
if this place
wasn't filled with candy.

10:56.883 --> 10:58.716
Okay, so what's
your favorite flavor?

10:58.718 --> 10:59.634
Coconut.

10:59.636 --> 11:01.352
And I'm walking to the "C"s.

11:01.354 --> 11:03.721
The candy's alphabetical?

11:03.723 --> 11:06.557
- Now I'm marrying you too.
- Okay.

11:06.559 --> 11:08.626
Let's see.
Coconut watermelon slice.

11:08.628 --> 11:09.894
How's that sound?

11:09.896 --> 11:11.362
Um, not so good.

11:11.364 --> 11:13.064
Actually, please
don't say anything more

11:13.066 --> 11:14.232
about candy.

11:14.234 --> 11:15.449
Is it hot in here?

11:15.451 --> 11:18.102
No, it's awesome
in here.

11:18.104 --> 11:20.771
Boston baked beans?

11:20.773 --> 11:23.124
Didn't know they weren't
real beans till I was 20.

11:23.126 --> 11:24.942
Please stop.

11:24.944 --> 11:27.245
Is it cold in here?

11:27.247 --> 11:29.947
Is it hot and cold
in here?

11:29.949 --> 11:30.948
Max, I feel weird.

11:30.950 --> 11:32.783
Relax,
it's just your lady parts

11:32.785 --> 11:36.287
waking up from hibernation.

11:36.289 --> 11:37.989
Again, small store.

11:37.991 --> 11:39.307
Can hear everything.

11:41.477 --> 11:43.427
I am so sorry.
Pardon me.

11:43.429 --> 11:44.512
Oh, uh,
are you okay?

11:44.514 --> 11:47.815
I'm fine.

11:47.817 --> 11:50.101
Max, I am not fine.

11:50.103 --> 11:53.371
I'm gonna be sloppy joanne
in about two seconds.

11:53.373 --> 11:55.189
Tiny, tiny store.

11:55.191 --> 11:56.674
Do you need to use the--

11:56.676 --> 11:58.109
No. We're fine.

11:58.111 --> 11:59.477
We'll just be going.
Nice to meet you.

12:01.014 --> 12:02.179
Nope, I'm not gonna make it.
Where is the--

12:02.181 --> 12:03.481
Right--right there.

12:06.819 --> 12:07.919
I'm sure she'll be all right.

12:19.349 --> 12:20.498
I'm just gonna step outside.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.999
The sound of someone
throwing up makes me--

12:22.001 --> 12:25.002
Oh, dude, I've been trying
to not throw up this whole time.

12:27.673 --> 12:31.809
Whew, what happened there,
right?

12:31.811 --> 12:33.394
Feeling better?

12:43.538 --> 12:45.539
Did she tell you
she projectile-puked

12:45.541 --> 12:48.125
soup and sloppy seconds
all over a really cute guy

12:48.127 --> 12:49.377
and his floor?

12:49.379 --> 12:51.629
Let me put it
this way, Caroline.

12:51.631 --> 12:53.631
In my heroin days,
that would have been

12:53.633 --> 12:58.269
a perfectly acceptable
first date.

12:58.271 --> 13:00.004
I don't understand it.

13:00.006 --> 13:01.605
We ate
the exact same thing.

13:01.607 --> 13:03.207
How could you have not
have gotten sick?

13:03.209 --> 13:05.142
You must still have
"rich girl" stomach.

13:05.144 --> 13:06.560
I'm used to poor food.

13:06.562 --> 13:09.730
What made you sick
made my skin clear up.

13:11.016 --> 13:13.234
- Hi, girls.
- Hey, Sophie.

13:13.236 --> 13:16.020
I'll be in my booth.

13:16.022 --> 13:17.521
Oh.

13:17.523 --> 13:22.726
Well, this is weird.

13:26.665 --> 13:28.849
It's okay.
You didn't know.

13:28.851 --> 13:32.953
Don't let it happen again.
Okay, good-bye now.

13:38.292 --> 13:40.344
Sophie, what do you think
you're doing?

13:40.346 --> 13:42.763
What? They were sitting
in my booth.

13:42.765 --> 13:45.099
It is not your booth,
it's my booth.

13:45.101 --> 13:49.103
If it was your booth,
wouldn't it have a booster seat?

13:51.356 --> 13:55.142
Oh, Sophie wants to dance?
We gonna dance.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.364
Max. Hi.

14:00.366 --> 14:02.983
It's Andy.
From the store.

14:02.985 --> 14:04.285
The guy who let you walk out

14:04.287 --> 14:05.953
with a push pop
in your pocket.

14:05.955 --> 14:07.488
That wasn't a push pop, Andy.

14:07.490 --> 14:09.373
I was happy to see you.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.826
Well, you're gonna be
even happier in a minute.

14:11.828 --> 14:13.294
Yay!

14:13.296 --> 14:14.578
But these come with a catch.

14:14.580 --> 14:15.880
Invites
for Caroline and you

14:15.882 --> 14:17.281
to a party at my candy store.

14:17.283 --> 14:19.417
But maybe
don't wear that uniform.

14:19.419 --> 14:21.969
People are gonna think
you're a giant sugar daddy.

14:26.975 --> 14:28.759
So, she's still going at it,
huh?

14:28.761 --> 14:30.010
Such a skinny girl.

14:30.012 --> 14:32.246
How much more
can come out of her?

14:32.248 --> 14:34.315
Nah, she's just
a little embarrassed.

14:34.317 --> 14:36.183
Something about self-esteem.
I don't know.

14:36.185 --> 14:38.269
She throws it around like
it means something.

14:38.271 --> 14:41.138
Well, I'd love her to come.
No pressure.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.523
But if you can talk her
into it,

14:42.525 --> 14:43.974
there'll be unlimited candy
for you

14:43.976 --> 14:44.975
for the rest of your life.

14:47.246 --> 14:49.029
Look at him,
stealing my bit.

14:52.617 --> 14:54.552
The candy man came
with invitations

14:54.554 --> 14:56.120
to a party at his store.

14:56.122 --> 14:58.822
What, you think I wasn't
listening at the door?

14:58.824 --> 14:59.924
I heard everything.

14:59.926 --> 15:02.009
All the vomit jokes.
I heard them all.

15:03.796 --> 15:08.665
Jewelry, already?

15:10.852 --> 15:14.472
Your new husband likes
to throw the cash around.

15:14.474 --> 15:16.107
He is not my new husband.

15:16.109 --> 15:18.025
And now he never will be.

15:18.027 --> 15:20.010
Ooh, bubble tape.

15:20.012 --> 15:22.613
I finally meet
an adorable, sweet guy.

15:22.615 --> 15:24.398
A guy so sweet,
the word "sweet"

15:24.400 --> 15:26.734
is next to his name
on actual real estate.

15:26.736 --> 15:30.187
And I completely destroy
any chance I have with him.

15:30.189 --> 15:32.289
You didn't destroy anything.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.791
And it's good to let him
know right off the bat

15:33.793 --> 15:37.912
that you have a gag reflex.

15:43.168 --> 15:45.035
Oh!
Oh, that's lovely.

15:45.037 --> 15:46.387
Happy Valentines' Day.

15:46.389 --> 15:48.806
I am not going to that party.

15:48.808 --> 15:50.141
I can never see him again.

15:50.143 --> 15:51.842
Well, do you mind
if I still go?

15:51.844 --> 15:53.377
Being in a candy store
after midnight

15:53.379 --> 15:54.845
is on my bucket list.

15:54.847 --> 15:57.714
Funny, I thought that was
the impossible one.

15:57.716 --> 16:00.384
You should go.
Have fun.

16:00.386 --> 16:01.652
I think you're missing out,

16:01.654 --> 16:03.070
because you two are perfect
for each other.

16:03.072 --> 16:04.321
You're like
Hansel and Gretel.

16:04.623 --> 16:06.942
They were brother and sister.

16:09.244 --> 16:10.945
So?

16:18.722 --> 16:20.856
- So, no Caroline, huh?
- Uh, no.

16:20.858 --> 16:22.758
- She couldn't make it.
- Hmm.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.226
Well, I'm feeling very sad,

16:24.228 --> 16:27.696
but you'll never know it.

16:28.998 --> 16:30.783
You're fine.

16:30.785 --> 16:33.585
You don't seem to be short
on other female party guests.

16:33.587 --> 16:34.703
Oh, come on. They're fiends.

16:34.705 --> 16:36.171
Some of them I know
from the neighborhood.

16:36.173 --> 16:37.422
Some I worked
with on Wall Street.

16:37.424 --> 16:38.924
Wall Street?

16:38.926 --> 16:40.042
Did you have
a little candy tray

16:40.044 --> 16:41.243
you walked around with?

16:41.245 --> 16:43.095
I wish.
That would have been awesome.

16:43.097 --> 16:44.746
I was stuck in
an office pushing stock

16:44.748 --> 16:46.098
in pharmaceutical companies.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.432
Wait.

16:47.434 --> 16:50.385
You know people
who have access to pills?

16:50.387 --> 16:52.621
And just when I thought you
couldn't get any better.

16:52.623 --> 16:55.390
Yeah, one day,
I went into the firm,

16:55.392 --> 16:56.892
and there was no firm.

16:56.894 --> 16:58.026
Bankrupt. Boom.

16:58.028 --> 16:59.778
End of job, no money.
Nothing.

16:59.780 --> 17:02.147
And after I drank nonstop
for a week,

17:02.149 --> 17:04.282
I figured,
hey, now I can do

17:04.285 --> 17:05.534
what I've always dreamed of.

17:05.536 --> 17:07.869
Open a candy store,
be my own boss.

17:07.872 --> 17:10.989
So I used all my savings
and opened up this place.

17:10.991 --> 17:12.324
And pretty soon,

17:12.326 --> 17:13.876
Candy Andy will rule

17:13.877 --> 17:16.278
the world
of sweets and treats.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.579
That sound braggy?

17:17.580 --> 17:18.714
No.

17:18.715 --> 17:19.998
All right,
kick everybody out,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.333
and let's go back
to my place.

17:21.335 --> 17:23.417
Ah...Max, no offense,

17:23.420 --> 17:24.953
but I'm more into your friend.

17:24.954 --> 17:26.637
Um, Andy, no offense,

17:26.640 --> 17:29.958
but I'm more into the candy
than the Andy.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.260
I want you to come
to my apartment

17:31.262 --> 17:32.227
and say hey to Caroline.

17:32.229 --> 17:33.178
I was right.

17:33.180 --> 17:34.847
You two are perfect
for each other.

17:34.849 --> 17:36.098
Yeah?

17:36.100 --> 17:37.482
I mean, it would be nice
to hang with her

17:37.484 --> 17:39.301
in pants
I don't care about.

17:45.942 --> 17:47.326
She's not here.

17:47.328 --> 17:49.477
She must have taken
the horse for a walk.

17:49.479 --> 17:50.812
Wait, you have a horse,

17:50.814 --> 17:52.080
and I'm just hearing
about this now?

17:52.082 --> 17:53.165
I have a candy store
and it's out of my mouth,

17:53.167 --> 17:55.083
in the first 30 seconds.

17:55.085 --> 17:56.418
Be right back.
I have to pee.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.453
She'll be okay with me
being here, right?

17:58.455 --> 17:59.671
Yeah,
she was just embarrassed.

17:59.673 --> 18:02.424
She'll get over it.

18:04.195 --> 18:07.045
What are you doing?
Knock first!

18:07.047 --> 18:09.281
Why are your legs up
in the air like that?

18:09.283 --> 18:10.582
And why were you holding
the shower head

18:10.584 --> 18:12.885
down by your--
Oh!

18:15.722 --> 18:17.089
I'm sorry.

18:17.091 --> 18:18.941
I thought you'd be home
feeling bad for yourself,

18:18.943 --> 18:23.579
not feeling your bad self.

18:23.581 --> 18:25.113
What are you doing
home already?

18:25.115 --> 18:26.648
Why aren't you
at the Candy Andy party?

18:26.650 --> 18:28.567
Oh, don't look at me
like that.

18:28.569 --> 18:29.818
It's not like
I'm the only person

18:29.820 --> 18:32.037
in the world
who masturbates.

18:33.624 --> 18:35.657
Also, Andy's here.

18:39.362 --> 18:41.079
We wanted to surprise you.

18:41.081 --> 18:43.382
But then you surprised us.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.706
It's not a big deal.

18:51.708 --> 18:54.476
That kind of situation
happens to a lot of people.

18:54.478 --> 18:58.480
Who? Who has that
ever happened to?

18:58.482 --> 19:01.600
I know this might be
a delicate area right now,

19:01.602 --> 19:03.435
but I'm thinking you should
probably pay more

19:03.437 --> 19:05.570
than half of our water bill.

19:05.572 --> 19:08.106
Hey, girls.

19:08.108 --> 19:10.325
I need some hot tea
to warm me up.

19:10.327 --> 19:12.244
There's no hot water
in our building

19:12.246 --> 19:14.062
when I tried to take
a shower.

19:14.064 --> 19:16.898
That's because
it's all in Caroline.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.283
Max!

19:18.285 --> 19:20.369
You are too tense.

19:20.371 --> 19:23.956
Here. Take this
and relax a little.

19:23.958 --> 19:25.573
Eh?

19:26.075 --> 19:28.710
This doing anything for you?

19:31.415 --> 19:33.882
Well, I'll be in my booth.

19:38.521 --> 19:40.755
Hello, Sophie.

19:40.757 --> 19:43.225
What are you doing
in my booth?

19:43.227 --> 19:45.861
It's not your booth,
it's my booth. And look.

19:45.863 --> 19:47.362
All the other booths are taken.

19:47.364 --> 19:49.064
So you'll have to sit
at small table,

19:49.066 --> 19:51.316
as is customary
for lone diners.

19:58.491 --> 19:59.825
This is my booth.

19:59.827 --> 20:04.162
It's okay, you didn't know.
Okay, bye-bye now.

20:05.315 --> 20:07.299
Hello, Max.
Check out my new booth.

20:07.301 --> 20:10.302
I think it's better.

20:12.138 --> 20:15.257
Oh, no.
I don't want to see him again.

20:15.259 --> 20:17.142
Look, he's already seen
you at your worst.

20:17.144 --> 20:20.128
You vomited and masturbated.
That's your full range.

20:21.630 --> 20:22.981
Hi.

20:22.983 --> 20:25.817
Look, I know you're
really embarrassed about--

20:25.819 --> 20:27.069
well, everything.

20:27.071 --> 20:29.021
And there's really nothing
I can say

20:29.023 --> 20:30.072
to convince you
not to be.

20:30.074 --> 20:32.524
So...

20:36.879 --> 20:37.996
Who's embarrassed now?

20:38.498 --> 20:40.282
And to further my embarrassment,

20:40.284 --> 20:43.852
I will now do gymnastics
in public.

20:50.126 --> 20:52.594
That is not embarrassing.
It was amazing.

20:52.596 --> 20:53.661
All right.

20:53.663 --> 20:54.846
Well, then come back
to my house

20:54.848 --> 20:57.665
and watch me masturbate.

21:01.771 --> 21:04.005
Or we could just get coffee.

21:05.007 --> 21:08.110
Yay,
I'm so happy!

21:08.112 --> 21:09.144
Thanks, Max.

21:09.146 --> 21:10.812
No, not for you.
For me.

21:10.814 --> 21:14.282
I'm getting unlimited candy
and maybe some pills.
