There are two of us,

I felt there was

a little sour

You've been working so hard
lately.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.244
Maybe you should take a break.

No. Marge, if I lose my job

04:07.114 --> 04:08.947

it's a death sentence.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.782
Well, I guess as a fallback,

04:10.784 --> 04:13.852
I could direct films,
like Angelina Jolie.

My husband can't really
think he's ten.

I'm saying, he so desperately
needs to believe he's ten,

08:54.134 --> 08:57.302
that only the original hypnotist
who did this can undo the trance

08:57.304 --> 08:59.905

damage to Homer's psyche.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.650
Do not force the truth.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.817
For now, just treat Homer

09:12.819 --> 09:15.153
just as you would
a regular ten-year-old boy.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.188

09:17.190 --> 09:18.356
No, I'm afraid not.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.525

are inflexible.

Well, I guess it'll have
to be in Bart's room.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.559

messy stuff like lasagna.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.664
Oh, and the TV would be on.

12:12.666 --> 12:13.998
