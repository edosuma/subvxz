(gun cocks)

00:19.790 --> 00:22.874
(cell phone ringing)

00:22.926 --> 00:24.961
Would you mind terribly
if I answered this?

00:24.963 --> 00:26.429
Give me that phone!

00:26.464 --> 00:28.047
Of course.
Don't shoot.

00:28.099 --> 00:30.716
I'm handing him my phone. The
embassy's been overrun by the army.

00:30.768 --> 00:32.768
They're about to take me hostage.
They're going to kill Rafiq!

00:32.804 --> 00:34.770
You're on speaker.
Who am I speaking to?

00:34.806 --> 00:37.273
US Secretary of State,
Walter Larson. Who's this?

00:37.308 --> 00:40.309
<i>I am General Ahmed Ali
of the Pakistan Armed Forces.</i>

00:40.361 --> 00:42.478
It's Ahmed Ali, Zaman's
highest-ranking general.

00:42.530 --> 00:45.398
Get me everything you can.
(toilet flushes)

00:45.450 --> 00:48.284
- Shit! Listen, General--
- <i>No, you listen.</i>

00:48.336 --> 00:50.453
In a few minutes,
you will see our flag

00:50.455 --> 00:52.038
flying above
what was once your embassy.

00:52.090 --> 00:54.674
We're also taking your highest-remaining
diplomat into custody.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.176
- He means me, sir!
- General? I highly recommend

00:57.212 --> 00:59.762
you don't kidnap
an American dignitary.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.964
Mr. Secretary,
seeing as you kidnapped

01:01.966 --> 01:04.099
seven of our nation's
glorious children,

01:04.135 --> 01:05.802
I'm showing
a great deal of restraint.

01:05.854 --> 01:07.220
General, let's negotiate.

01:07.272 --> 01:09.472
What do you want? Anything
is on the table, I mean it.

01:09.474 --> 01:12.141
I'm sorry. Pakistan does not
negotiate with terrorists.

01:12.143 --> 01:14.310
- Goodbye, Mr. Secretary.
- <i>Wait, wait, wait!</i>

01:14.312 --> 01:16.813
In 60 seconds, the ambassador's
secure line will ring.

01:16.865 --> 01:20.116
It's encrypted. No ISI, no CIA.
Just you and me.

01:20.151 --> 01:22.485
General, we know that wasn't
a goddamn earthquake.

01:22.537 --> 01:25.822
If Zaman tries to launch another
missile, we will obliterate you.

01:25.824 --> 01:28.207
<i>You have a choice--
watch your country</i>

01:28.243 --> 01:29.826
<i>get carpet-bombed
back to the Stone Age</i>

01:29.878 --> 01:31.494
by the entire US Fifth Fleet,

01:31.546 --> 01:34.914
or become the next
president of Pakistan.

01:34.966 --> 01:37.216
(mouths)

01:37.752 --> 01:39.469
- I must hang up now.
Both: No, don't hang up!

01:39.504 --> 01:41.003
- Walter!
- No!

01:41.027 --> 01:43.427
_

01:45.643 --> 01:47.560
You see whose plane
they have us in?

01:47.595 --> 01:49.145
Who knows, man? I--

01:49.180 --> 01:50.513
Tilson, Taylor,
hold up a minute.

01:50.515 --> 01:52.682
- Sir?
- I'm sorry, but you're grounded.

01:52.684 --> 01:54.650
- What are you talking about?
- We got protocols, Commander.

01:54.686 --> 01:56.185
You were both
prisoners of war.

01:56.237 --> 01:58.070
- We were?
- Before you get back up there,

01:58.106 --> 02:00.490
you gotta take a med test,
you gotta pass a psych exam.

02:00.525 --> 02:01.824
Come on,
that's bullshit, sir!

02:01.860 --> 02:03.910
We were prisoners
of a couple of cannibal freaks

02:03.945 --> 02:06.162
- who tried to kill each other.
- And fuck us.

02:06.197 --> 02:07.697
Screw the red tape, sir.

02:07.699 --> 02:09.916
Everybody else is up there.

02:09.951 --> 02:11.534
Look, it's not up to me.

02:11.536 --> 02:14.420
This came from the top.
Admiral McBride doesn't want you to fly.

02:14.456 --> 02:17.874
- Man, fuck the admiral!
- Whoa, dude.

02:17.926 --> 02:19.625
(cell phone ringing)

02:19.677 --> 02:22.378
- Come on, come on, answer, answer.
- Thank you.

02:22.380 --> 02:23.796
Confirmed.
The plan is in motion.

02:23.848 --> 02:25.298
Fax is on its way to Talbot.

02:25.350 --> 02:26.516
Good. General?
General?

02:26.551 --> 02:28.184
Ahmed:
<i>Speak quickly, Mr. Secretary.</i>

02:28.219 --> 02:30.520
Zaman is expecting
to see the flag of Pakistan

02:30.555 --> 02:32.305
flying above this building
at any moment.

02:32.357 --> 02:34.474
General, I can give you the full
backing of the United States,

02:34.526 --> 02:37.727
plus anything you might need
on a personal level.

02:37.779 --> 02:39.278
Sir, we really
shouldn't be in here.

02:39.314 --> 02:40.780
<i>Even if I agreed
to this plan,</i>

02:40.815 --> 02:42.231
I could not arrest Zaman
and take power

02:42.283 --> 02:44.534
without the support of all the generals.
It is not possible.

02:44.569 --> 02:47.403
<i>Which is why I've made contact
with Zaman's former psychiatrist.</i>

02:47.455 --> 02:49.622
The fax he's sending you
right now is filled

02:49.657 --> 02:51.741
with the man's darkest
psycho-sexual secrets.

02:51.793 --> 02:53.292
What use would I have
for that?

02:53.328 --> 02:55.745
I want you to use it to
convince the other generals.

02:55.747 --> 02:58.331
Alex: Tell Hassan
it might be time

02:58.383 --> 03:00.299
to make the leap into the
present and buy a scanner.

03:00.335 --> 03:03.553
Okay, thank you, Uncle,
for saving our lives.

03:03.588 --> 03:06.088
All right, that's
everything I have on Zaman.

03:06.090 --> 03:09.642
30 pages of the craziest rantings
of a certifiable psychopath

03:09.677 --> 03:11.844
you will ever have
the misfortune of reading.

03:11.896 --> 03:13.145
Thank you, Hassan!

03:13.181 --> 03:15.346
Praise God, I hope I never
hear that voice again.

03:15.371 --> 03:16.931
Listen, Uncle, Fareeda
and the girls

03:16.956 --> 03:19.252
were taken to Bagram
Air Force Base in Afghanistan.

03:19.255 --> 03:20.427
What are you talking about?

03:20.452 --> 03:22.373
Fareeda and the girls are with
your mother and father at the cabin.

03:22.408 --> 03:24.041
What?
Are you sure?

03:24.076 --> 03:27.378
I just spoke with them. A helicopter
dropped her and the girls off.

03:27.413 --> 03:28.879
Blew away
your mother's berry garden.

03:28.915 --> 03:30.247
<i>She was not pleased.</i>

03:30.299 --> 03:32.166
Now I must go.
My decaf milky tea is ready.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.051
No, wait, Uncle! The Americans
are going to start bombing!

03:34.086 --> 03:36.053
You need to get out of there!
You need to get to the cabin.

03:36.088 --> 03:40.224
Locked in a small cabin with
seven screaming teenage girls?

03:40.259 --> 03:43.594
I'll take my chances here.
Thank you. God be with us.

03:43.646 --> 03:44.979
(scanner humming)

03:45.014 --> 03:47.014
Fareeda is
at my uncle's cabin?

03:47.066 --> 03:49.900
Hmm? Oh, yeah. Before I almost
just took a bullet for you,

03:49.936 --> 03:51.852
I was bribing the pilots,
getting your sister

03:51.854 --> 03:54.822
and the girls to safety, sacrificing
my retirement fund to the karma gods.

03:54.857 --> 03:57.358
But, you know, whatever.
No big deal.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.027
Thank you
for cleaning up the mess

04:00.029 --> 04:01.829
that you've created
to begin with.

04:01.864 --> 04:04.532
(scanner makes slicing sound)
Let's do this.

04:06.085 --> 04:08.202
Walter: <i>I'll give you the
same deal I gave Raja,</i>

04:08.204 --> 04:09.370
spy satellites and all.

04:09.372 --> 04:11.872
I also want
a nuclear ballistic submarine.

04:11.874 --> 04:12.874
Fuck me.

04:12.925 --> 04:15.009
And two giraffes
for our national zoo.

04:15.044 --> 04:17.628
One male, one female.
Every time I take my daughter,

04:17.680 --> 04:19.713
she says, "Papa,
where are the giraffes?"

04:19.765 --> 04:21.682
Done!
Write down "giraffes."

04:21.716 --> 04:23.300
- Giraffes?
- I'll explain later.

04:23.352 --> 04:25.302
Now, what was in it
for Raja, personally?

04:25.354 --> 04:27.304
$200 million.

04:27.356 --> 04:29.056
And it goes without saying
that you will

04:29.058 --> 04:31.141
restart military aid
to my country immediately.

04:31.194 --> 04:32.726
Goes without saying,
but no more crazy talk.

04:32.778 --> 04:34.058
No more stirring up
the peasants.

04:34.063 --> 04:35.813
That's what led to this mess.

04:35.865 --> 04:37.065
Maybe just a little
crazy talk.

04:37.066 --> 04:38.566
This is Pakistan, after all.

04:38.618 --> 04:41.368
Fine, but only the normal amount,
like we've always agreed to.

04:41.404 --> 04:43.454
Not this off-the-deep-end,
nuke-Israel shit.

04:43.489 --> 04:46.790
Once Walter closes this deal, that's it.
I'm gone. Off to Paris.

04:46.826 --> 04:49.877
Gorgeous women, delicious pastries.
It's gonna be sweet.

04:49.912 --> 04:51.795
Yeah, I'll miss you, too.

04:51.831 --> 04:53.330
I also need
those seven schoolgirls.

04:53.382 --> 04:54.915
<i>I can't give you
the schoolgirls.</i>

04:54.917 --> 04:56.083
Then we have no deal.

04:56.135 --> 04:57.635
How about I try to kill you?

04:57.670 --> 04:59.553
- Come again?
- <i>We bomb your house.</i>

04:59.589 --> 05:01.055
You're not in it
at the time, of course.

05:01.090 --> 05:03.057
We issue a public apology,
you reject the apology.

05:03.092 --> 05:05.226
You're perceived as your
own man, not our puppet.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.011
It's the next best thing
to martyrdom.

05:07.063 --> 05:09.179
But I just renovated
the entire second floor.

05:09.232 --> 05:11.098
We already laid down
all the plumbing.

05:11.150 --> 05:12.433
I could blow up your car
with a drone.

05:12.435 --> 05:13.449
(cell phone ringing)

05:13.474 --> 05:14.768
Zaman is calling me now.

05:14.770 --> 05:16.186
General,
do we have a deal or not?

05:16.239 --> 05:17.521
One second.

05:17.573 --> 05:20.858
(both speaking Urdu)

05:25.248 --> 05:27.148
(speaks Urdu)

05:27.200 --> 05:28.783
General, what did you
just say to him?

05:28.835 --> 05:31.252
I told him that we've stormed the
embassy, taken the ambassador,

05:31.287 --> 05:32.703
and safely retrieved
those girls.

05:32.755 --> 05:35.840
- You have made the right choice.
- Yes!

05:35.875 --> 05:38.009
Blow up my car
and we have a deal.

05:38.044 --> 05:38.959
My lease is up anyway.

05:39.012 --> 05:41.345
Excellent! It is true.
Zaman is insane.

05:41.381 --> 05:43.681
He's planning to launch
another missile at Israel.

05:43.716 --> 05:46.217
I keep telling him that our goal
is not to obliterate Israel.

05:46.219 --> 05:48.269
It's to obliterate India.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.388
Let's discuss that
after you take power.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.056
Now, go arrest
that son of a bitch.

05:52.058 --> 05:53.778
Talbot will go with you
as my eyes and ears.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.393
I'll need his signal
that you've succeeded.

05:55.445 --> 05:56.894
- <i>Good luck.
- I will need it.</i>

05:56.896 --> 05:59.947
And before you go, General, put
Talbot on the phone, please.

05:59.982 --> 06:01.232
It's for you.

06:01.284 --> 06:03.034
Sorry about the guns earlier.

06:03.069 --> 06:04.902
(speaks Urdu)

06:04.904 --> 06:07.988
Walter: Larson!
- Sir, I think our secret is out.

06:08.941 --> 06:10.374
Pierce is alerting
the Secret Service!

06:10.410 --> 06:12.910
Talbot, are you sitting
at the ambassador's desk?

06:12.912 --> 06:14.078
Yes, sir.

06:14.130 --> 06:15.913
There should be a humidor
somewhere around.

06:15.965 --> 06:17.498
Uh, yes, sir.
I'm looking right at it.

06:17.550 --> 06:19.800
It was a gift from Pierce to all
of our ambassadors in the region,

06:19.836 --> 06:21.052
when he got confirmed
for DOD.

06:21.087 --> 06:22.887
Okay, you want me
to spark one up?

06:22.922 --> 06:25.639
What are we celebrating?
My impending Parisian transferral?

06:25.675 --> 06:27.308
Talbot, when this thing is
over, I will transfer you

06:27.343 --> 06:29.093
- wherever your heart desires.
- <i>Nice!</i>

06:29.095 --> 06:31.562
Now open it up.
Remove the top tray.

06:32.097 --> 06:34.098
Okay, what am I looking for?

06:34.100 --> 06:35.599
You'll know it
when you see it.

06:38.571 --> 06:39.987
Oh.

06:40.022 --> 06:41.939
Look, I need you
to go with the general.

06:41.941 --> 06:45.576
If this thing goes south, you're going
to shoot Zaman in the fucking head.

06:50.083 --> 06:51.832
Show me what
you're made of, Talbot.

06:51.868 --> 06:54.752
Uh...

06:54.787 --> 06:56.120
Shit.
(door rattles)

06:56.172 --> 06:58.372
(beeps)
Let me know how it turns out.

06:58.424 --> 07:01.509
Sir, we've been asked to escort
you out of the West Wing.

07:01.544 --> 07:04.879
Not a problem.
I'm leaving.

07:09.035 --> 07:11.285
It's like rush hour at the
Dulles Airport up there.

07:11.337 --> 07:14.204
Tell Harry Truman this is
our goddamn air space.

07:14.257 --> 07:16.957
I'm running the biggest aerial
attack since Shock and Awe,

07:16.959 --> 07:19.376
and my targeting intel
is for shit!

07:19.428 --> 07:22.513
Sir, Lieutenant Commander Zeke
Tilson has requested to see you.

07:22.548 --> 07:24.515
Make it fast.

07:24.550 --> 07:26.100
Tilson, I am up
to my elbows in pig shit.

07:26.135 --> 07:28.302
I got a four-star
at Central Command on hold,

07:28.304 --> 07:30.137
but, please,
step your entitled ass up.

07:30.139 --> 07:32.306
What can the Navy
do for you today?

07:32.308 --> 07:33.807
Permission to speak
freely, sir.

07:33.809 --> 07:35.142
Just fuckin' talk, pilot.

07:35.194 --> 07:37.778
Sir, you gotta let me
back up in the air.

07:37.813 --> 07:40.281
These reintegration protocols
and psych tests,

07:40.316 --> 07:42.366
you know it's just
red-tape bullshit.

07:42.401 --> 07:43.951
I like red-tape bullshit.

07:43.986 --> 07:46.904
I use it to keep fuck-ups
like you out of my way.

07:46.956 --> 07:50.491
All due respect, sir,
I'm your best goddamn pilot.

07:50.543 --> 07:54.411
Tilson, right now,
you're my worst goddamn pilot.

07:54.463 --> 07:57.047
My best pilots don't piss
positive for opiates.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.883
My best pilots don't get
their asses shot down.

07:59.919 --> 08:02.086
My best pilots
don't blow up Indian drones

08:02.138 --> 08:05.673
and put my spotless
naval record at risk!

08:05.675 --> 08:07.174
Is that what this
is about, sir?

08:07.176 --> 08:09.009
This is about the fact
that, as of now,

08:09.011 --> 08:12.680
your naval career is over.
You are a goddamn piece of gum

08:12.682 --> 08:14.515
that got stuck
on the bottom of my shoe,

08:14.517 --> 08:18.268
and the time has come to toss
that fuckin' shoe in the trash!

08:18.321 --> 08:20.270
- Sir, please--
- You want to help this war, son?

08:20.323 --> 08:22.189
Jump off the fuckin' ship.

08:22.841 --> 08:25.993
Now, get the hell out of here!
I got a war to run.

08:26.028 --> 08:28.495
(braying)

08:30.199 --> 08:32.416
- What happens after I shoot him?
- His guys shoot you.

08:32.451 --> 08:34.534
- We need a plan B!
- You are plan B.

08:34.587 --> 08:37.504
- I hate plan B!
- It's an honor to die for your country.

08:37.539 --> 08:39.173
It's not my country!
It's your country.

08:39.207 --> 08:40.758
- Maybe you should do it.
- Okay. No, I'm good--

08:40.793 --> 08:42.842
- No, please, let me give
you this gift.      - No.

08:42.878 --> 08:44.678
It's like letting a Jew
kill Hitler.

08:44.714 --> 08:46.547
He gave the gun to you.
It's your gun.

08:46.549 --> 08:48.966
He wanted you to do it.
You, Alex Talbot,

08:49.018 --> 08:51.018
you're going to change
the course of history.

08:51.053 --> 08:52.720
- Oh, God.
- Honestly, I'm jealous.

08:52.772 --> 08:54.605
- Oh, God.
- You okay?

08:54.640 --> 08:55.856
I'm hyperventilating.

08:55.891 --> 08:57.391
Okay, as long as you
can use your hands.

08:57.443 --> 08:58.809
- I don't think I can do it.
- You can do this.

08:58.861 --> 09:00.644
- I don't think I can.
- You can do it.

09:00.696 --> 09:02.613
- You think I can?
- I know you can--

09:02.648 --> 09:04.448
- I can't do it!
- You can do it, okay?

09:04.483 --> 09:06.233
- I don't think I can!
- You're gonna do this!

09:06.235 --> 09:08.068
- You're gonna be there?
- Yes, I will be there.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.204
- Okay, we'll do this together.
- You'll do it.

09:10.239 --> 09:13.540
- But you'll be there?
- But I'll be in the area.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.706
_

09:18.831 --> 09:21.165
Your husband's outside
and wants to talk--

09:21.217 --> 09:23.634
- I need a favor. - I just heard
that the White House physician

09:23.669 --> 09:26.003
had to put three stitches
in Pierce's forehead.

09:26.055 --> 09:28.088
What? Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

09:28.090 --> 09:30.530
Damn it, Walter. Madeleine Albright
never body slammed anyone.

09:30.559 --> 09:33.260
- Not that we know of.
- It is amazing that you still have a job.

09:33.262 --> 09:34.678
I know, really.
More importantly,

09:34.730 --> 09:36.930
I just convinced one of
Amir Zaman's top generals

09:36.932 --> 09:38.849
to arrest him
and take power in Pakistan.

09:38.901 --> 09:40.434
- Which one?
- Ahmed Ali. Do you know him?

09:40.436 --> 09:42.269
Yeah, that guy's insane.
All he wants to do is nuke India.

09:42.321 --> 09:45.189
I know, but I can only deal with one
nuclear crisis at a time, Joanne.

09:45.241 --> 09:47.107
Right now, I need your help
to get to Pierce.

09:47.159 --> 09:49.910
He's the only one that can convince
the president to call off Infinite Wisdom.

09:49.945 --> 09:51.779
And you think Pierce is going
to give you the time of day

09:51.831 --> 09:53.031
after what
you just did to him?

09:53.082 --> 09:54.615
That's why I need you,
to get him to trust me.

09:54.667 --> 09:55.916
- I don't even trust you.
- Joanne!

09:55.951 --> 09:57.951
I am not Kendra.
I don't work for you.

09:57.953 --> 10:01.171
Please, comprehend the fact that
I have my own real-person job,

10:01.207 --> 10:03.457
a real-person job that I am
trying desperately to keep.

10:03.509 --> 10:05.292
So, no, I can't do
any more favors for you.

10:05.294 --> 10:08.212
You wanted to keep our lives separate?
This is what separate means.

10:08.264 --> 10:10.380
By separate, I just meant
you could sleep with Billy.

10:10.433 --> 10:12.182
And you could sleep
with Asian hookers,

10:12.218 --> 10:14.601
Urdu translators,
and Heidi from the hotel.

10:14.637 --> 10:16.470
How do you know about Heidi?
That just happened.

10:16.472 --> 10:18.605
I work for the DOD, and your
pilot is an Air Force major.

10:18.641 --> 10:21.141
And how were you able to do that,
anyway, right after you had surgery?

10:21.193 --> 10:23.026
Trust me,
Heidi was very disappointed.

10:23.062 --> 10:24.862
This isn't working
for me anymore.

10:24.897 --> 10:26.697
- Is it working for you?
- Not at this moment, no.

10:26.699 --> 10:28.982
Listen, Joanne, this is a very
thought-provoking conversation,

10:29.034 --> 10:32.119
but can we table it, please?
Pakistan just set off a nuclear device.

10:32.154 --> 10:34.321
- What the fu-- When?
- About an hour ago.

10:34.373 --> 10:36.907
We got bombers in the air.
I need to talk to Pierce.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.992
I'll get Pierce
out of the Sit Room.

10:38.994 --> 10:40.627
That's all we need.

10:40.663 --> 10:42.546
Don't say "we."

10:43.181 --> 10:46.667
My marriage is trashed. Gail
never wants to see me again.

10:46.719 --> 10:48.969
Now, my career
is in the fucking toilet!

10:49.004 --> 10:50.282
(banging)

10:50.807 --> 10:52.222
What's the point, man?

10:52.958 --> 10:54.508
Are you drinking Listerine?

10:54.510 --> 10:57.094
No, man, Blue Curaçao.

10:57.146 --> 10:58.679
Keep it
in a mouthwash bottle.

10:58.731 --> 11:01.431
That's genius.
(laughs)

11:05.187 --> 11:07.321
- You know what, Glenn?
- What's that, man?

11:07.356 --> 11:09.857
We've been looking at this thing
completely fuckin' backwards.

11:09.909 --> 11:12.526
We're not grounded.

11:12.578 --> 11:13.861
We're free, man!

11:13.863 --> 11:16.029
Plus, we're going
to be rolling in it,

11:16.081 --> 11:18.699
thanks to...
boner dude!

11:18.701 --> 11:19.833
Yes!
(laughs)

11:19.869 --> 11:21.835
- We got plans!
- We got hard plans.

11:21.871 --> 11:24.872
We gotta stop staring at our toes and
start staring at the fuckin' moon!

11:24.874 --> 11:26.373
That's what I'm saying!

11:26.375 --> 11:28.125
(both shouting)

11:28.177 --> 11:30.544
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't drink it all, man!

11:30.596 --> 11:32.462
Dude!

11:32.515 --> 11:33.881
(groans)

11:33.933 --> 11:36.884
(speaking Urdu)

11:39.638 --> 11:42.723
(shouts in Urdu)

11:49.231 --> 11:50.231
Translate.

11:50.282 --> 11:51.782
Okay, I'm trying.
It's just...

11:51.817 --> 11:53.066
They're all talking
over each other.

11:53.118 --> 11:54.401
- Just give me the gist!
- Okay, all right.

11:54.403 --> 11:56.453
The general has informed
Zaman of his betrayal,

11:56.488 --> 12:00.324
and he is trying to convince the
other generals to side with him.

12:00.376 --> 12:01.491
Oh, God, it's on.

12:01.544 --> 12:03.493
He's saying that
without US foreign aid,

12:03.546 --> 12:05.913
Pakistan will fall
under India's control.

12:05.915 --> 12:07.080
Uh-huh.
Are they going for it?

12:07.132 --> 12:08.715
Mm, they seem receptive.

12:08.751 --> 12:10.801
(shouting in Urdu)
What, what, what?

12:10.836 --> 12:12.302
Okay, he's saying
you and I are proof

12:12.338 --> 12:13.670
that when
he becomes president,

12:13.722 --> 12:16.256
US foreign aid will be
reinstated immediately.

12:16.308 --> 12:18.258
Okay, why is Zaman
pointing at us?

12:18.260 --> 12:22.429
Okay, so Zaman is saying that the
only thing you and I are proof of,

12:22.481 --> 12:24.598
is that the general
is a puppet of the US.

12:24.650 --> 12:26.600
No, no, not a puppet.
He's his own man!

12:26.602 --> 12:29.319
(all arguing)

12:29.355 --> 12:31.271
So, the general is now
arresting Zaman.

12:31.273 --> 12:33.023
- Done deal. Done deal?
- No, no, no.

12:33.075 --> 12:35.025
(all shouting)
(guns cocking)

12:35.077 --> 12:37.027
Zaman is now arresting
the general.

12:37.079 --> 12:39.780
There seems to be some confusion
as to who's arresting whom,

12:39.782 --> 12:41.281
and if you and I
are going to be killed.

12:41.283 --> 12:42.749
Jesus. Which way is
this thing going to go?

12:42.785 --> 12:44.102
(all shouting)

12:44.227 --> 12:45.726
It's a little bit
of a loose ball.

12:45.754 --> 12:47.120
Fuck!

12:47.172 --> 12:49.089
Wait, wait.
Our guy might have a deal.

12:49.124 --> 12:51.792
We might have a deal?
(men shouting)

12:51.794 --> 12:53.377
(guns cocking)
Never mind.

12:53.429 --> 12:54.795
What happened?
I thought our guy had a deal.

12:54.847 --> 12:56.380
- No, no, no, no.
- You said we might have a deal!

12:56.432 --> 12:58.015
It unraveled, it unraveled.
I can't take this.

12:58.050 --> 12:59.883
I can't take it, I can't
take it, I can't take it!

12:59.935 --> 13:02.135
Shit. I think we're going
to have to go to plan B.

13:02.187 --> 13:03.470
- Right now?
- Right now.

13:03.472 --> 13:04.752
I can't.
No, I don't think I can.

13:04.773 --> 13:06.273
- I think that you can.
- I don't think I can.

13:06.308 --> 13:07.441
- Right now, do it.
- I don't think I can.

13:07.476 --> 13:08.809
I think you can do it.

13:14.733 --> 13:17.401
All right, Joanne, what is it? I'm right
in the middle of a major operation.

13:17.453 --> 13:19.620
- I understand. Actually, Walter--
- Larson?

13:19.655 --> 13:20.654
What the hell
is he doing here?

13:20.706 --> 13:22.823
- I come in peace.
- You better stay away from me.

13:22.875 --> 13:25.492
All he understands
is violence.

13:25.494 --> 13:26.827
- I don't speak to him.
- Tell him I'm sorry.

13:26.879 --> 13:28.211
He's very sorry.

13:28.247 --> 13:29.796
Tell him I'm racked
with guilt.

13:29.832 --> 13:31.965
- He's racked with guilt. - Tell him
I said he should go fuck himself.

13:32.001 --> 13:34.668
Fuck yourself. Mr. Secretary,
just hear him out.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.420
He has a crucial
new piece of information.

13:36.472 --> 13:38.338
I've got a general
taking power in Pakistan.

13:38.390 --> 13:41.675
He's friendly to the United
States and he's relatively sane.

13:41.727 --> 13:42.926
Another one? Please.

13:42.978 --> 13:44.738
He should be arresting Zaman
right about now.

13:44.763 --> 13:46.203
You need to get back
to the Sit Room.

13:46.231 --> 13:48.348
You need to recall
Operation Infinite Shitstorm.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.850
- "Wisdom."
- That's what I said.

13:49.852 --> 13:51.485
Let's say I believe you,
which I don't.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.154
What happens if your plan, just
like all your other plans,

13:54.189 --> 13:56.406
- turns to shit?
- I've got a gun in the room.

13:56.442 --> 13:58.909
He's ready to blow Zaman's
brains all over the wall.

13:58.944 --> 14:01.695
Since when does the State
Department employ Black Ops?

14:01.697 --> 14:03.747
It's buried deep
in the budget.

14:04.582 --> 14:07.250
You didn't tell me that part.

14:07.286 --> 14:09.703
(men arguing in Urdu)

14:09.705 --> 14:11.505
Okay, go now, go now.
Do it now.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.507
- I don't think I can shoot him from here.
- Then get closer.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.542
- No, I don't want to get closer.
- Get closer.

14:15.594 --> 14:18.211
No, I don't-- No-- On second
thought, I can do it from here.

14:18.263 --> 14:20.097
- Stop fuckin' pushing me!
- Just do it.

14:20.132 --> 14:21.715
(all arguing)

14:21.717 --> 14:23.016
Do it!

14:23.969 --> 14:25.135
Do it now.

14:25.187 --> 14:26.720
(snaps fingers)

14:28.390 --> 14:31.024
- No!
- Ah! What? What's happening?

14:31.060 --> 14:33.193
He's showing Zaman
his psychiatric file.

14:33.228 --> 14:35.562
(speaking Urdu)
Alex: What's he saying?

14:35.614 --> 14:39.066
Apparently, Zaman is plagued
by crippling impotence,

14:39.068 --> 14:40.734
and he's not
very well endowed.

14:40.786 --> 14:43.070
(speaking Urdu)

14:43.072 --> 14:44.621
I believe the term
is "pencil dick."

14:45.356 --> 14:47.941
I don't care if he has a weenus.
What's happening?

14:48.077 --> 14:49.743
Okay, it's unclear,

14:49.795 --> 14:53.380
but apparently,
Zaman has fantasies

14:53.415 --> 14:55.415
of watching his wife
have sex with young men,

14:55.417 --> 14:58.885
who he then tortures
and executes,

14:58.921 --> 15:01.722
but not before he has
consumed their genitalia

15:01.757 --> 15:04.508
in order to make himself
more virile.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.343
(shouting in Urdu)

15:06.395 --> 15:09.229
Oh! Not a fantasy.

15:09.264 --> 15:10.897
(shouting)

15:10.933 --> 15:13.483
(speaking Urdu)

15:13.519 --> 15:15.685
Zaman's toast.
(laughs)

15:15.738 --> 15:17.020
We're good. It's over.

15:17.072 --> 15:18.605
Buddy.

15:18.657 --> 15:19.940
(laughs)

15:19.942 --> 15:22.659
(shouting in Urdu)

15:22.694 --> 15:24.578
- Take our picture.
- Yes.

15:24.613 --> 15:28.081
Oh, yeah, nice.
Okay... (speaks Urdu)

15:28.117 --> 15:30.867
- No hard feelings.
- Fuck you.

15:30.919 --> 15:33.787
Alex:
Boom. Boom.

15:33.789 --> 15:35.205
Woosh-ch!

15:35.257 --> 15:37.090
Bullshit!
This is all bullshit.

15:37.126 --> 15:38.792
Don't try to muck up my war.

15:38.794 --> 15:41.795
There's only one way to take out
Zaman's nuclear capability,

15:41.797 --> 15:43.513
- and I'm doing it.
- You think I'm lying?

15:43.549 --> 15:44.749
All right,
let's see the proof.

15:44.767 --> 15:46.550
Well, I don't have any
right this second.

15:46.602 --> 15:48.769
Goodbye, Walter.
And you, you're fired.

15:48.804 --> 15:50.220
- What did I do?
- You married him.

15:50.272 --> 15:51.721
- Yup.
- You can't go!

15:51.774 --> 15:53.523
- Are you gonna hit me again?
- If he won't, I might.

15:53.559 --> 15:54.891
I don't have time for this.
(phone beeping)

15:54.943 --> 15:56.693
You want proof?
There's proof!

15:58.947 --> 16:00.147
It doesn't get
any proofier than that.

16:00.199 --> 16:01.314
Are you getting these
right now?

16:01.366 --> 16:02.532
You're seeing 'em
as I'm seeing 'em.

16:02.568 --> 16:04.284
Were these taken inside
the Presidential Palace?

16:04.319 --> 16:05.819
- Yes, why?
- That's on the target list.

16:05.821 --> 16:07.654
- Our planes are minutes away.
- Shit. Pierce, you and me,

16:07.656 --> 16:09.489
- Sit Room, now!
- Joanne, you're still fired.

16:09.541 --> 16:11.041
- I heard you the first time.
- Join the club.

16:11.076 --> 16:13.043
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Come on, Walter, let's do it!

16:13.078 --> 16:14.494
- We have a lot to talk about.
C- learly.

16:14.496 --> 16:15.962
- Over dinner?
- Go!

16:15.998 --> 16:20.133
(rock music playing)
(both hooting, grunting)

16:20.169 --> 16:21.301
All right, just punch me.

Do me, do me, do me!

16:42.373 --> 16:44.774

16:49.531 --> 16:50.864

All Pakistani nuclear sites

Nice job, Larson.

17:06.181 --> 17:08.464
(muttering in Urdu)

17:08.517 --> 17:11.050
So, uh, what's going
to happen with him now?

17:11.053 --> 17:14.387
He will be tried before a jury of his
peers, and then hanged until he dies.

17:14.388 --> 17:15.939
We are a democracy.

17:17.059 --> 17:18.391
Right.

17:20.112 --> 17:22.479
The mail plane
is out there right now

17:22.531 --> 17:23.813
and nobody's watching it.

17:23.866 --> 17:27.200
We take it,
we fly it to Ibiza.

17:27.236 --> 17:30.036
We use the money
from the boner guy statue

17:30.072 --> 17:32.405
to buy ourselves a house
and we live there forever.

17:32.407 --> 17:35.742
There's not enough gas in the
mail plane to get to Ibiza.

17:35.794 --> 17:37.827
Fine!
We take it to Zanzibar.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.330
We can fuckin' make it
to Zanzibar.

17:40.382 --> 17:43.083
- Nothing in Zanzibar.
- There are women in Zanzibar.

17:43.085 --> 17:45.218
- Women?
- We sex the women.

17:45.254 --> 17:47.587
We make the babies.
We start a tribe.

- What about the mail?

17:50.475 --> 17:52.142
We can't steal the mail.
That's a federal offense.

17:52.177 --> 17:53.927
You're right. We leave the mail.
We steal the plane.

17:54.012 --> 17:55.061
- That's good!
- Ah!

17:55.097 --> 17:56.897

Rafiq, I'm flying blind here.

18:40.609 --> 18:43.727
You might want
to call Walter, right now.

18:43.779 --> 18:44.978
Why?

18:49.401 --> 18:52.819
Sir, Alex Talbot is on the phone.
He says it's urgent.

18:52.871 --> 18:54.871
- I'll take it out in the hallway.
- No.

18:54.906 --> 18:57.657
Um, he says he wants
the president to hear this, too.

18:59.378 --> 19:00.493
Woman:
Mic is on, sir.

19:00.545 --> 19:03.713
- Who is this now?
- That guy.

19:03.749 --> 19:05.632
He's Black Ops.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.000
This is President Navarro.

19:07.002 --> 19:08.385
Mr. President,
Alex Talbot.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.053
Yes, Mr. Talbot. I want
to personally thank you--

19:10.088 --> 19:12.255
No time. Listen, before
Zaman was arrested,

19:12.307 --> 19:13.974
he launched a fighter jet
towards Israel,

19:14.009 --> 19:15.508
armed with a nuclear missile.

19:17.896 --> 19:20.981
The pilot is a loyalist. He was
ordered not to recall for any reason.

19:21.016 --> 19:23.016
How fast can one of those
get to Tel Aviv?

19:23.068 --> 19:25.735
As the crow flies,
probably seven hours,

19:25.771 --> 19:27.237
if it's avoiding radar.

19:27.272 --> 19:29.906
I'm being told that it
took off five hours ago.

19:29.941 --> 19:32.192
We're not seeing it on radar.

19:32.194 --> 19:35.528
Yes, he's probably flying out
over the water.

19:35.530 --> 19:37.364
I'd go south
along the Arabian Sea,

19:37.416 --> 19:40.367
hug the Yemeni coast, then
turn right, up the Red Sea.

19:40.369 --> 19:42.836
Five hours would put it
over the Gulf of Aden.

19:42.871 --> 19:44.754
Right, but their plane
could barely make it to Israel,

19:44.790 --> 19:47.257
let alone all the way back to
Pakistan, without refueling.

19:47.292 --> 19:49.259
It's a suicide mission.

19:49.294 --> 19:52.712
Talbot, listen to me! You need to
get Zaman to recall that pilot.

19:52.714 --> 19:55.265
How?
By any means necessary.

19:58.053 --> 19:59.519
What'd he say?

19:59.554 --> 20:01.638
He said we've got to get
Zaman to recall the pilot.

20:01.690 --> 20:03.940
How?
He didn't really offer

20:03.975 --> 20:05.725
any concrete suggestions.

20:09.815 --> 20:14.734
Our people have mapped out the most
likely flight path to avoid radar.

20:14.786 --> 20:16.236
We've got to inform
the Israelis.

20:16.238 --> 20:17.787
No, it's too far
for the Israelis.

20:17.823 --> 20:20.123
That cruise missile could
go off as far away as Mecca

20:20.158 --> 20:21.238
and still hit Israeli soil.

20:21.243 --> 20:23.243
This is on us.
Pierce, please tell me

20:23.295 --> 20:25.745
- we've got a carrier in that region.
- Chief?

20:25.797 --> 20:28.798
Closest attack squadron's aboard
the USS Ulysses S. Grant.

20:28.834 --> 20:32.836
And they just sent every pilot
they had 500 miles into Pakistan.

20:36.675 --> 20:37.807
Didn't they?

20:37.843 --> 20:40.477
Zeke:

20:40.512 --> 20:43.680
Both:

20:45.434 --> 20:48.151

No women for Carl.

20:48.186 --> 20:50.437
Only ugly chicks.

20:50.439 --> 20:52.605
There's no ugly chicks
in Zanzibar, man.

20:52.607 --> 20:54.741
Oh, man, I love that plan.

20:54.776 --> 20:57.327

20:59.081 --> 21:01.414
