WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:03.625
(SIREN WAILING
IN THE DISTANCE)

00:07.670 --> 00:11.436
BOTH:
* Glory, glory,
Man United

00:11.510 --> 00:14.502
* Glory, glory,
Man United

00:14.580 --> 00:17.674
* Glory, glory,
Man United

00:17.750 --> 00:19.945
* The Reds go marching on

00:20.020 --> 00:22.682
* And on and on
and on and on and on *

00:22.750 --> 00:24.615
Our lads are gonna
run all over

00:24.690 --> 00:26.453
those Liverpool slags today!

00:26.520 --> 00:28.852
Unless Rooney walks
round the pitch

00:28.920 --> 00:30.751
like a child lost
in a shopping center.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.424
Go away.
Go away you tosspot!

00:33.500 --> 00:34.922
Hey, stop it,
or I'm gonna throw you out!

00:37.400 --> 00:38.867
Holy sh...

00:47.540 --> 00:50.043
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Break it up!

00:50.110 --> 00:52.112
What is going on here?

00:52.180 --> 00:53.272
Just a friendly
disagreement.

00:53.350 --> 00:55.477
Okay, I can't have
you two psychos

00:55.550 --> 00:57.245
tearing up my town,

00:57.320 --> 00:59.117
so what's
the disagreement about?

00:59.190 --> 01:01.556
Just, you know,
who had the best game ever...

01:01.620 --> 01:04.327
Wayne Rooney
or Old Twinkl_e Toes
Van PerSIe.

01:04.390 --> 01:07.826
Hey!
At least it is a valid
and Important argument.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.959
Ah, you wouldn't get it.
I get it, okay?

01:10.030 --> 01:12.396
Okay? I am
a football fan myself,

01:12.470 --> 01:14.836
so maybe I can help you guys
figure it out.

01:14.900 --> 01:18.131
On September 2, 2012,
Van Persie had a hat trick

01:18.210 --> 01:20.303
in a 3-2 win.
Right on!

01:20.380 --> 01:22.940
But Wayne Rooney
also had a hat trick

01:23.010 --> 01:24.739
against Arsenal,
August 28, 2011.

01:24.810 --> 01:27.278
He added two more that year,
April 2nd and September 10th.

01:27.350 --> 01:29.215
'Cause he's the best.
Not so fast.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.281
Van Persie's World Cup
header against Spain

01:31.350 --> 01:34.183
on June 13, 2014,
at the 43-minute mark

01:34.260 --> 01:37.787
was possibly
the greatest goal
I have ever seen.

01:37.860 --> 01:39.293
How the hell
do you know all this?

01:39.360 --> 01:40.725
Well, I told you,
I'm a footy fan,

01:40.800 --> 01:43.189
plus I'm a medical miracle,
and I kind of remember
everything.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.669
Who's the best player,
then?

01:44.730 --> 01:47.062
Simple.
Lionel Messi.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.289
Oh!
What?

01:48.370 --> 01:51.066
Come on,
let's get out of here.
Go on!

01:51.140 --> 01:54.200
I see
those gentlemen took
a liking to you.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.373
Ah, well, you know,
I attract a certain type.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.803
They're passionate.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.643
Their passion distracted
the driver enough

01:59.720 --> 02:02.348
that he ran into a guy
when he wandered into
the street...

02:02.420 --> 02:04.411
Steve Hickson, 38,

02:04.490 --> 02:06.378
been in and out
of mental-health facilities.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.755
He's currently homeless.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.697
Right now he's on his way
to Bellevue.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.469
What are we doing here, Al?
There's no crime.

02:16.530 --> 02:20.034
We are here
because Steve Hickson
was wearing this.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.758
Jacket belongs
to David Walton,
Dr. David Walton.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.034
Ring any bells?

02:26.110 --> 02:27.975
World-famous
plastic surgeon

02:28.040 --> 02:30.440
and currently
New York's most high-profile
missing person

02:30.510 --> 02:31.875
for the last three months.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.646
Walton was wearing
this Jacket when
he disappeared.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.312
Hot lead in a cold case.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.998
So this Dr. Walton,
he wasn't just one

02:53.070 --> 02:54.799
of those run-of-the-mill
boob-job guys

02:54.870 --> 02:57.134
that advertise
on the subway.
He was cutting edge.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.064
He's a pioneer
in facial reconstruction,

02:59.140 --> 03:00.300
skin-grafting technology,

03:00.380 --> 03:02.575
basically everything
from celebrity makeovers

03:02.650 --> 03:03.969
to burn victims.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.245
No_ ransom note.
No Signs of foul play.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.174
Detectives didn't think
it was a kidnapping.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.343
Apparently Walton
was quite the ladies' man.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.581
They think he ran off
with a mistress.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.719
Probably resurface
on a tropical island

03:14.790 --> 03:16.326
sipping one of those drinks
with an umbrella in it.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.221
Island living,
maybe Dr. Walton decides

03:18.290 --> 03:19.552
he doesn't need
his fancy jacket.

03:19.630 --> 03:20.790
Let's hope
that's the case.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.396
What about Steve Hickson,
the guy who was hit?

03:22.470 --> 03:23.528
Any connection
between the two of them?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.067
Uh, doesn't look like it.

03:25.130 --> 03:26.336
Hickson's medical
file's thick,

03:26.400 --> 03:28.368
but he's never
had a cosmetic procedure done.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.169
What about a personal
relationship between the two?

03:30.240 --> 03:32.731
Well, Walton's wife said
she didn't recognize Hickson,

03:32.810 --> 03:35.278
but she and the doctor
have only been together
for a few years.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.774
She said it's possible
he knew Hickson
before their marriage,

03:37.850 --> 03:39.841
even sent us some old photos
to look through,

03:39.920 --> 03:42.741
but facial recognition
hasn't made any matches
yet to Hickson.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.053
Their passion
distracted the driver enough

03:49.120 --> 03:51.850
that he ran into a guy when
he wandered into the street.

03:54.030 --> 03:55.622
You know, Al,
there was a guy,

03:55.700 --> 03:58.396
a homeless guy who was wearing
those exact same shoes.

03:58.470 --> 04:00.267
Ostrich skin.
Guy's got good taste.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.398
AL: Let's find this guy.

04:01.470 --> 04:03.335
Jay, get out there
and help Denny.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.832
You got it, boss.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.479
Bro, we got the guy's height,
his eye color,

04:10.550 --> 04:12.939
his approximate weight
all because Carrie saw
some guy

04:13.020 --> 04:15.318
wearing ostrich shoes
at the crime scene.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.245
Denny, you've been here
for what, three months,

04:17.320 --> 04:19.049
and you're still a fanboy?
DENNY: What?

04:19.120 --> 04:21.588
Okay, Carrie says our guy
is 6 foot, 200 pounds,

04:21.660 --> 04:24.356
green eyes,
wearing a denim jacket.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.920
Bro, it's incredible.
I just...

04:27.160 --> 04:29.219
Hey, let me ask you
a question, Jay Bones.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.927
Yeah.
You ever, uh...

04:31.000 --> 04:32.968
I don't know, you ever
consider plastic surgery?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.735
No.
Why do you ask?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.802
I mean, no reason.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.462
Well, I mean, actually,
I, uh...

04:38.540 --> 04:40.098
Go ahead, spit it out.
What?

04:40.180 --> 04:41.636
Calf implants.

04:41.710 --> 04:42.904
Are you serious?

04:42.980 --> 04:44.447
On you?
I don't know.

04:44.510 --> 04:45.909
I feel like,
I feel like I need
a little bit more volume,

04:45.980 --> 04:47.868
you know? Like...

04:47.950 --> 04:49.508
I mean, you can't tell
in these jeans, obviously.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.285
No, I can tell.
Definitely.

04:51.350 --> 04:52.658
Oh, okay.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.188
I get it, Jay the joker.
All right.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.396
You are joking, right?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.664
Denny, I think you need
to put your current calves
to work right now.

05:05.730 --> 05:06.890
We got a runner!

05:14.610 --> 05:16.578
JAY: Police, damn it!
Freeze!

05:31.460 --> 05:32.757
Later, cop!

05:36.370 --> 05:37.462
Hello, criminal!

05:38.830 --> 05:40.934
Man you need to work
on your "got ya" lines.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.831
What are you talking about?
That was classic.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.105
It was pretty weak.
You see that?

05:45.170 --> 05:47.035
You know, shut up man!

05:47.880 --> 05:49.108
Come on.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.975
AL: Mel Davies.

05:53.050 --> 05:55.041
Thanks for
the reading material.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.509
B&E bust two years back,

05:57.590 --> 05:59.854
some petty theft
four years ago,

06:01.060 --> 06:03.381
and now you're wearing
the shoes of a man

06:03.460 --> 06:05.485
who's been missing
for months.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.323
Interesting.
Not really.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.890
They keep my feet warm.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.428
Maybe you don't see it
like I do.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.365
_ What I see
IS a respected surgeon

06:13.440 --> 06:14.793
walking through
a bad neighborhood

06:14.870 --> 06:18.237
with some nice threads
and probably a fat wallet.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.608
You come up and offer,
not so gently,

06:20.680 --> 06:22.170
to take that wallet,

06:22.240 --> 06:26.609
but the doctor doesn't want
to give it to you,
so it gets violent.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.240
Before you know it,
the doctor needs a doctor.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.389
That's crazy.

06:30.450 --> 06:32.281
No, what's crazy
is running

06:32.350 --> 06:33.954
if you don't have anything
to hide.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.386
It's like you said, man.
I'm an ex-con.

06:36.460 --> 06:37.654
I mean,
it says right there.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.357
I got two parole violations
already.

06:39.430 --> 06:41.022
Last thing I need
is a third strike.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.727
I mean, I see the police
coming looking for me,

06:42.800 --> 06:44.062
of course
my first thought is,

06:44.130 --> 06:45.199
"I got to get the hell
out of Dodge."

06:45.270 --> 06:47.693
Mel, we're not looking
to fix you up,

06:47.770 --> 06:49.931
but we need to know
how you got these

06:50.010 --> 06:52.706
and how Hickson
got that fancy jacket.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.634
Well, ifI tell you,
can I go?

06:54.710 --> 06:57.907
If you don't,
three-time loser.
You're gomg away.

06:59.050 --> 07:01.041
Steve found them

07:01.120 --> 07:03.384
in this Dumpster
near where I stay.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.257
Is Steve gonna be okay?

07:11.330 --> 07:13.252
Banged up,
but he's gonna make it.

07:13.760 --> 07:14.852
Good.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.002
All right, listen,
this is the last time

07:24.070 --> 07:26.004
we use "Rock, Paper, Scissors"
to dim up duties, okay?

07:26.070 --> 07:29.574
You're right.
Next time I'll just
order you to do it.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.301
Oh, you know,
"Rock, Paper, Scissors"
is fine, you know.

07:32.380 --> 07:33.779
That's what I thought.
That too.

07:33.850 --> 07:34.942
Okay.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.110
We got some nice threads here.
We got a baby-blue
button-down shirt.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.724
Slacks...
36-inch waist.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.451
These are what's left
of the clothes

07:45.530 --> 07:48.454
Walton was wearing
when he disappeared,
but that was three months ago.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.327
Why are they
showing up now?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.129
I mean, these Dumpsters
get emptied once a week,
right?

07:52.200 --> 07:53.838
So that must have
been dumped recently.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.093
Makes sense...

07:56.170 --> 07:58.968
Remote area,
not a lot of
foot traffic.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.507
So why is that door open?

08:35.680 --> 08:36.840
Denny.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.145
David Walton?

08:44.220 --> 08:47.087
Our missing-persons case
just became a homicide.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.794
DELINA: There's significant
bruising on both wrists,

08:57.870 --> 09:00.031
but these injuries occurred
before death,

09:00.100 --> 09:02.489
no signs that this body
was moved postmortem.

09:02.570 --> 09:04.265
My guess is Dr. Walton
was killed

09:04.340 --> 09:06.979
exactly where you guys
found him.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.769
Cause of death
was a .38—caliber bullet

09:08.840 --> 09:10.341
through the left side
of the temple,

09:10.410 --> 09:13.277
creating a large
_exit wound on the
right Side of the skull.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.510
Time of death,

09:14.580 --> 09:16.719
definitely
within the last 72 hours.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.939
Hmm.
Last 72 hours?

09:18.020 --> 09:21.080
You sure about that?
Of course I'm sure.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.627
Are we having
our first fight, Jay?

09:26.830 --> 09:30.391
What Jay means
is that the timeline
doesn't really add up.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.995
David Walton,
he disappeared
three months ago.

09:33.070 --> 09:34.731
Why wait to kill him now?

09:34.800 --> 09:37.963
Well, that sounds
like a question
for a good detective.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.678
I bet you'll find the answer.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.129
I'm sure I will._
No, I mean we Will.

09:42.210 --> 09:43.973
All right, yeah, come on.
I mean all of us.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.403
You did a good job.
Thanks, Delina. Thank you.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.181
You got a little tongue-tied
back there, didn't you?

09:55.260 --> 09:56.352
What do you mean?

09:56.420 --> 09:57.557
Me?
Oh, no, nothing.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.723
I don't know.
I wasn't tongue-tied.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.926
All right, fine.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.092
Hey, look, I'm just yanking
your chain.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.969
No, 'cause...
'cause I wasn't, all right?

10:04.030 --> 10:06.089
Okay.
Okay, maybe I was a little...

10:06.170 --> 10:07.398
You're doing it again.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.729
Do you think she noticed?

10:11.810 --> 10:12.902
Oh, man.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.231
Brother, you're in deep.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.331
We got anything from CSU?

10:16.410 --> 10:18.947
Right. Uh, nothing conclusive
on the prints,

10:19.010 --> 10:22.047
no DNA samples.
Not a single camera
in the area caught anything.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.918
Well, it looks like somebody
knows a perfect dumps spot
when they find one.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.754
Well, there's
no forensic evidence
that ties him to the scene.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.253
If he did go
into that abandoned building,

10:29.320 --> 10:30.924
CSU would've known.

10:30.990 --> 10:33.049
But they found this.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.253
This was in the room
with the body.

10:36.330 --> 10:38.423
It was in a pile of trash.
Looks pretty new, right?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.162
Yeah, but there's no telling
whether it was dumped before,
dunng,

10:41.240 --> 10:42.434
or after the murder.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.058
Chernov Construction?

10:44.140 --> 10:45.698
It's a construction company
in Queens.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.079
I made a call over_ there.
Boss's name is
Gregory Chernov.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.142
Ah, anything on him?

10:50.210 --> 10:52.599
No.
Guy's squeaky clean.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.910
Apparently hands out
dozens of these things

10:54.980 --> 10:56.242
to clients,
investors, workers.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.810
It's kind of
like his calling card.

10:57.890 --> 11:01.212
I highly doubt Carrie
will be satisfied
with that answer.

11:01.290 --> 11:02.655
I'm so sorry, detectives.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.686
I wish I could be
of more help,
but I have no idea

11:04.760 --> 11:07.058
how the notepad ended up
at a crime scene.

11:07.130 --> 11:09.018
Client, associate?

11:09.100 --> 11:10.465
It could be anybody.

11:10.530 --> 11:13.658
I mean, I got a zillion
of these things.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.435
Saw an infomercial
about how people use them

11:15.500 --> 11:16.967
to help remember stuff.

11:18.140 --> 11:19.402
You mind?

11:19.470 --> 11:20.937
This _one has a mind
like a Sieve.

11:21.010 --> 11:22.500
Can't remember a thing.

11:22.580 --> 11:23.740
Ah, you can take
as many as you want.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.471
I ordered in bulk,
saved 200 bucks.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.579
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm pretty slammed.

11:28.650 --> 11:30.789
We, uh, we're behind
on two different projects,

11:30.850 --> 11:33.080
and we break ground
on a new work site on
Wednesday.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.889
Plus, I'm bidding
on three more.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.849
Of course,
all of this has got to happen
during ragweed season.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.158
Ugh.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.959
Ah, these allergies
are killing me.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.528
Not to mention
my damn celiac.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.465
I had a muffin
a couple of days ago.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.862
You can imagine
what happened.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.465
Do you have employee files
that I could take a look at?

11:51.540 --> 11:53.201
Uh, yeah, I do.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.078
Um, here are
the most recent ones.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.108
There's the whole bunch.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.541
Man, that's, um...

12:04.520 --> 12:06.681
Steve Hickson, 38,

12:06.760 --> 12:08.751
been in and out
of mental-health facilities,

12:08.820 --> 12:09.957
currently homeless.

12:12.260 --> 12:16.356
Hey, this guy,
this guy, Evan Charney...

12:16.430 --> 12:17.829
What's his story?

12:17.900 --> 12:19.561
Evan, yeah,
he's a great guy.

12:19.630 --> 12:21.393
Been working
for me Six months.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.062
What, you think
he's mixed up in anything?

12:23.140 --> 12:24.562
You know
where I can find him?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.198
I might want to talk to him.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.828
Uh, yeah.
He's, uh...

12:27.910 --> 12:29.377
Let's see here.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.300
Yeah, I got him working
out in Queens today.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.484
See, I told you
they were useful.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.985
Thanks.
Thanks.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.760
Thank you, gentlemen.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.889
That was surprisingly
gracious of you.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.564
Well, you know, if I gave
every construction worker

12:55.640 --> 12:58.029
in New York City
that wolf-whistled
at me a hard time,

12:58.110 --> 13:00.635
well, there would be
no construction getting done,
now, would there?

13:00.710 --> 13:02.177
New York thanks you.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.508
So what can
I do you for, detectives?

13:05.580 --> 13:08.117
Oh, well, you could
lower your voice,
for a start.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.989
Sorry.
Occupational hazard.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.415
15 years
as an explosive tech

13:11.490 --> 13:12.548
kind of blew out
my eardrums.

13:12.620 --> 13:13.655
Oh.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.424
Safety first,
demolition day.

13:17.490 --> 13:19.890
One of you guys goes
up in smoke, I'm on the hook.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.291
MAN: Hey, boss.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.225
Boss, we got a problem
with this detonator.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.763
The problem is with you,
not the detonator.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.592
I told you, you got to get
a J-hook igniter,

13:28.670 --> 13:31.332
you want that detcord
to blow, right?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.469
There you go.
Now get out of here.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.701
Grown-ups are talking.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.071
VVho?
Evan Charney.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.311
Oh, you just missed him.
He had to go.

13:42.380 --> 13:44.189
Had some personal call.
Had to head out early.

13:44.250 --> 13:45.342
You know where he lives?

13:45.420 --> 13:47.285
Uh, Brooklyn, I think,
someplace.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.852
There's the whole bunch.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.379
Man, that's, um...

13:55.030 --> 13:59.023
5012, Bedford Avenue,
apartment 1A, Bed-Stuy.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.989
Uh, sure. Yeah, that,
that sounds about right.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.606
Denny and Jay
aren't far from there.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.001
I'll let them know.
All right.

14:07.140 --> 14:09.005
Hey, I'm sorry
about my boys.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.878
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm, you know...
I'm flattered.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.770
What?
I'm flattered!

14:13.850 --> 14:17.183
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, can you blame them.
Look at you.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.683
Oh.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.081
Thank you!

14:20.160 --> 14:21.912
_ You _too!
Nice seeing you!

14:23.490 --> 14:24.980
They're on it.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.839
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
come on, man.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.367
I'm doing the
knock-and-notice
this time.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.930
Uh, no, because you knocked
the last time

14:37.010 --> 14:38.762
and the time before
that, so...

14:38.840 --> 14:41.001
Yes, because a few weeks ago,
you got to kick in a door,
okay?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.968
Kicking in a door
is worth, like,
seven knocks!

14:43.050 --> 14:44.506
It's a solid Six.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.343
That's true.
No, you're right.
All right, thank you.

14:46.410 --> 14:47.809
Yeah, okay.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.417
Evan Charney! Police!
We got a few questions
for you!

14:50.490 --> 14:51.718
You know
that door's open, right?

14:53.190 --> 14:54.657
Somebody beat us here.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.585
Yeah, and they left
in a hurry.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.184
You ready?
Go.

14:58.260 --> 14:59.625
Police!

15:11.540 --> 15:12.837
JAY: Denny!
Yo.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.140
I think we found Evan.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.409
This was
no robbery gone wrong.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.048
Well, yeah, we figured
that when we found

15:27.120 --> 15:28.758
the $65,000 cash
in the closet.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.219
Hey, boss.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.258
Just Spoke to the landlord,
and get this.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.798
Evan had a roommate,
Jordan Scott, 35.

15:34.860 --> 15:37.920
I pulled up his file, boss,
and it is thick.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.390
Wow. Jordan Scott's
been busy, huh?

15:41.470 --> 15:44.007
Armed robbery,
assault with
a deadly weapon,

15:44.070 --> 15:45.606
attempted murder.

15:45.670 --> 15:48.138
Now, it turns out,
before Evan left
the work site,

15:48.210 --> 15:50.599
he got a call
from Jordan's cell phone.

15:50.680 --> 15:51.908
And get this.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.278
Jordan owns a .38...

15:54.350 --> 15:56.671
Same caliber gun used
to kill Evan.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.889
And that's the same
caliber used to kill our
dead doctor,

15:58.950 --> 16:00.156
David Walton.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.380
Good job, boys.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.485
Congratulations,
Jordan Scott.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.949
You might be our
first legitimate suspect.

16:06.030 --> 16:07.292
Oh, there's more, Cap.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.759
Come with us
to the basement.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.432
What the hell is this?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.995
Hey, check it, Denny.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.538
Jordan and Evan definitely
kidnapped Dr. Walton.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.603
Prints lifted off the
chains were 100%
match for the doctor,

16:51.670 --> 16:53.399
and it looks like
they were holding him

16:53.480 --> 16:55.334
in that apartment
for the past three months.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.605
Yeah, but what beef do
these guys have with a doctor?

16:57.680 --> 17:00.615
There's no ransom.
There's no demands.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.978
Why, why keep a guy
alive for three months
and suddenly kill him?

17:03.050 --> 17:04.312
I don't know,
but it's obvious

17:04.390 --> 17:06.017
they didn't want
anybody to find him.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.149
I mean, I guess that
explains why Evan
was at the crime scene

17:08.220 --> 17:09.949
where the homeless guy
got hit by a cab, right?

17:10.020 --> 17:12.250
He must have been there
before the accident,

17:12.330 --> 17:14.651
just looking for Walton's
jacket to get it back.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.459
Once we got hold
of the jacket,

17:16.530 --> 17:18.122
Jordan and Evan
must have known

17:18.200 --> 17:19.827
that it was only a matter
of time till we got to them.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.037
Yeah,
I still don't understand,

17:21.100 --> 17:22.931
why keep Walton alive
for so long?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.503
What ties do Jordan
and Evan have

17:25.570 --> 17:27.003
with a fancy plastic surgeon?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.638
Well, let's find out.

17:28.710 --> 17:30.302
I hope you don't have
any plans for dinner tonight.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.802
Oh, not anymore, no.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.518
Pizza?

17:33.580 --> 17:35.241
Jay, we had pizza last night.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.969
Pizza's great
every night, bro.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.411
Hey, boss,
you wanted to see me?

17:42.490 --> 17:44.481
I do.
Are you familiar

17:44.560 --> 17:47.893
with Major Crimes policy
34.5 B?

17:47.960 --> 17:49.097
It's on the tip
of my tongue, boss...

17:49.160 --> 17:51.663
There is no
Major Crimes policy 34.5 B.

17:51.730 --> 17:56.030
However, there is a policy
about billing four pizzas.

17:56.100 --> 18:00.139
Two pepperoni, one sausage,
one anchow,
to Major Crimes.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.734
Boss, look, I...

18:01.810 --> 18:04.870
You just decided
to forge my Signature
to authorize expenses.

18:04.950 --> 18:08.169
You nailed the R,
but the "S"s are no good.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.070
You got to try harder
next time.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.744
So, um, where are we
with that roommate,
Jordan Scott?

18:12.820 --> 18:14.356
Right now Jay's running
Evan and Jordan

18:14.420 --> 18:15.717
through all our databases,
butthafsit

18:15.790 --> 18:17.189
Blood, bodies,
handcuffs,

18:17.260 --> 18:18.488
what the hell went on
over there?

18:18.560 --> 18:20.699
Boss, we find the link
between Jordan, Evan,

18:20.760 --> 18:22.125
and Dr. Walton,
we got our answer.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.259
You get on that.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.389
And, uh, look,
I'm sorry again...

18:26.470 --> 18:29.291
Garlic and mozzarella,
for next time.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.562
That is classic.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.079
JAY: So I looked
through Dr. Walton's
patient records,

18:37.150 --> 18:39.539
and guess who got
an irregular mole removed
by the good doctor

18:39.610 --> 18:40.747
18 months ago.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.549
Jordan Scott.
You got it, boss.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.087
Well, that's a start.
It still doesn't give us

18:44.150 --> 18:46.448
motive for homicide
and kidnapping.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.886
What else do we have
on Jordan and Evan,

18:48.960 --> 18:50.427
besides the fact
they Shared a place together?

18:50.490 --> 18:51.957
Glad you asked.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.726
So I traced
the $65,000 in the closet

18:54.800 --> 18:56.392
to a bank robbery in Atlanta,

18:56.460 --> 18:58.769
and it wasn't
their first job together.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.298
Looks like they had
quite a little
operation going.

19:01.370 --> 19:04.259
In the last five years,
Jordan and Evan traveled

19:04.340 --> 19:07.138
to six different cities
together,

19:07.210 --> 19:09.371
and it looks like Jordan
was the mastermind.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.601
His MO was getting Evan
to infiltrate a company

19:11.680 --> 19:13.216
and pose as an employee.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.838
Evan would act
as the inSIde guy,

19:14.920 --> 19:17.070
feeding security codes
and procedures to Jordan.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.542
Mom-and-pop store,

19:19.620 --> 19:21.349
pharmacy,
real-estate office,

19:21.420 --> 19:23.559
and finally a bank,
they're upping their game,
huh?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.518
Chernov Construction
must have been their
next mark.

19:25.590 --> 19:28.923
Okay, but what does
kidnapping a plastic surgeon

19:29.000 --> 19:30.888
have to do_ with construction?
We're missmg something.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.159
Hold on. Why don't we just
ask Jordan himself?

19:36.240 --> 19:38.037
His cell phone just pinged
off of a tower in Queens.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.361
What's the address?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.305
No address, but we got
a three-block radius

19:41.380 --> 19:43.132
around Roosevelt and 87th.

19:43.210 --> 19:46.099
Wasn't Evan's construction
site around Roosevelt
and 86th?

19:46.180 --> 19:47.477
Yes, it was.

19:47.550 --> 19:48.778
Jordan can't go back
to his apartment.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.249
I'll bet
he's camping out there.

19:50.820 --> 19:52.219
All right.

20:45.610 --> 20:47.237
CLINT: Problem is with you,
not the detonator.

20:47.310 --> 20:48.971
I told you, you got to get
a J-hook igniter,

20:49.040 --> 20:50.371
you want that detcord
to blow.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.011
Get down!

21:12.470 --> 21:13.767
Jordan knew
we were coming.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.137
The cell phone ping
was a plant.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.805
We'd be buried under that
rubble if it wasn't for you.

21:17.870 --> 21:19.098
I guess I owe you one.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.070
One?

21:21.140 --> 21:23.108
_Jordan never worked
in construction, right?

21:23.180 --> 21:24.943
But he knew how
to rig the exploswes.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.705
How do you explain that?
Jay!

21:28.520 --> 21:30.112
Was there anything
on Jordan's phone

21:30.180 --> 21:31.909
that linked
to Chernov Construction?

21:31.990 --> 21:34.311
Nothing yet. Still got to run
through all these numbers.

21:37.660 --> 21:40.185
15 years as an
explosive tech kind of
blew out my eardrums.

21:40.260 --> 21:41.295
Oh.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.023
This one...

21:46.100 --> 21:49.467
That's the construction
foreman's phone number,
Clint.

21:49.540 --> 21:52.259
Now, Jordan called him
at least four times
last week.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.137
Maybe he knows
what Jordan's up to?

21:54.210 --> 21:55.632
Get a home address
on this guy.

21:55.710 --> 21:56.938
Roger that, boss.

21:58.410 --> 22:01.117
WOMAN: Baby!
You forgot your lunch.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.647
Yeah, just a second.

22:07.620 --> 22:10.919
Hey, so what do you think
she made for you?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.189
How you doing, Clint?

22:21.440 --> 22:22.589
Jordan Scott.

22:22.670 --> 22:23.830
I don't know
who that is.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.265
Really? We got Jordan calling
you four times.

22:26.340 --> 22:27.568
So what?

22:27.640 --> 22:29.073
So we'd like to know
what you're doing hanging out

22:29.140 --> 22:31.040
with a guy we think killed
one of your workers...

22:31.110 --> 22:32.941
Evan Charney.
Evan's dead?

22:33.010 --> 22:35.274
That's right, and Jordan
just tried to blow me up

22:35.350 --> 22:37.170
atone_ _
of your construction Sites.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.740
Did you help him rig that?

22:38.820 --> 22:41.288
What, are you crazy?
I wouldn't do something
that reckless!

22:43.020 --> 22:45.079
Although...
Although what?

22:45.160 --> 22:47.549
Jordan, Jordan was asking me
demolition-related questions.

22:47.630 --> 22:50.258
That you answered.
Yeah, why not?

22:50.330 --> 22:51.866
Teaching people
to blow shit up,

22:51.930 --> 22:53.761
is that something you do
on a regular basis?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.137
Come on, man,
guys always want
to hear stuff like that.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.929
So what were you
and Jordan up to?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.104
Nothing, okay?
Evan just put me in
touch with the guy, okay?

22:59.170 --> 23:00.432
I've only talked to him
over the phone.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.876
What were the calls about?

23:02.940 --> 23:05.602
Look, Jordan,
he throws odd jobs
my way, okay?

23:05.680 --> 23:07.443
Look, I got alimony
payments to make,

23:07.520 --> 23:08.839
and the dough was good,
so I did it.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.717
Odd jobs like what,
construction work?

23:12.350 --> 23:13.681
No, man.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.179
It was more like
waste management, okay?

23:21.730 --> 23:24.119
AL: So Jordan calls,
says he'll give you $10,000

23:24.200 --> 23:26.998
to dispose of this dead body,
and you do it?

23:27.070 --> 23:28.833
I told you
I'm strapped for cash.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.936
You recognize the body
when you buried it?

23:31.010 --> 23:32.568
No, it was wrapped up
in trash bags.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.403
And you didn't look?
Hell, no.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.072
The less I know,
the better.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.846
That's the first smart thing
you've said all day.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.049
Delina, we have enough
to ID the body?

23:40.110 --> 23:41.441
This body's badly decomposed,

23:41.520 --> 23:43.340
but dental records
could provide a match.

23:43.420 --> 23:45.581
I can tell by the hand
that this is a male,

23:45.650 --> 23:48.756
and maybe this ring
could help us ID.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.758
I ordered in bulk,
saved 200 bucks.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.695
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm pretty slammed.

24:01.770 --> 24:04.068
We, uh, we're behind
on two different projects.

24:06.610 --> 24:09.704
St. Michaels College,
class of '95.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.544
Chernov had a diploma
in his office,

24:12.610 --> 24:15.875
St. Michael's College,
class of '95.

24:15.950 --> 24:18.646
So this victim and Chernov
were maybe classmates?

24:18.720 --> 24:22.281
That college is in Aberdeen.
There's not that many
graduates living here.

24:25.460 --> 24:28.349
Dr. Walton, he wasn't just
one of those run-of-the-mill,

24:28.430 --> 24:30.193
boob-job guys that advertise
on the subway.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.297
He was cutting edge.
He's a pioneer
in facial reconstruction.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.633
Let's see here.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.735
Yeah, I got him working
out in Queens today.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.070
I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

24:44.150 --> 24:48.712
but what if we were talking
to Jordan Scott yesterday?

24:48.780 --> 24:50.680
Oh, come on, that's crazy.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.651
Jordan could never
make himself look that
much like Chernov.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.859
You're right,
Jordan couldn't,

24:55.920 --> 24:59.185
but a world-class
plastic surgeon could.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.263
Okay, so how does
this all work?

25:09.340 --> 25:11.808
Because they don't look
the same to me.

25:11.870 --> 25:15.271
Not on the surface,
but here, take a closer look.

25:15.340 --> 25:18.173
What's important is the basic
facial bone structure, right?

25:18.250 --> 25:20.206
There are 14
critical match points,

25:20.280 --> 25:21.918
and based
on occipital definition

25:21.980 --> 25:23.413
and hyoid definition,

25:23.480 --> 25:26.381
Jordan and Chernov
are actually qUIte Similar.

25:26.450 --> 25:28.008
Now, it would be
one hell of a surgery,

25:28.090 --> 25:30.058
but it could definitely
be done.

25:30.120 --> 25:33.692
What would somebody
need to create kind of
a makeshift OR

25:33.760 --> 25:35.159
to pull off an operation
like this?

25:35.230 --> 25:37.221
You would need a high-tech
surgical field kit

25:37.300 --> 25:38.665
and a doctor who knows
what he's doing

25:38.730 --> 25:40.834
and can operate under
less-than-optimal conditions.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.562
Which is why Dr. Walton
was a perfect ﬁt, right?

25:43.640 --> 25:46.063
He assisted in trauma units
in the first Gulf War,

25:46.140 --> 25:48.779
so operating in
Jordan's apartment,
no big deal.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.001
Infection would be
the main problem,

25:51.080 --> 25:53.048
but if they kept Dr. Walton
alive long enough

25:53.110 --> 25:54.338
to supervise the recovery,

25:54.420 --> 25:57.548
then I'd say,
with a little bit of luck,

25:57.620 --> 25:59.588
they could actually
pull this off.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.988
I'm sorry. I could have sworn
that you just said to me

26:04.060 --> 26:06.085
that a man
had his face reconstructed

26:06.160 --> 26:07.627
to look like another man.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.520
I know it's out there,
but we have to move
fast on this.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.158
Chernov, I mean Jordan,

26:11.230 --> 26:13.027
hasn't been seen
Since yesterday.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.499
You know the phrase
"start at the beginning"?

26:14.570 --> 26:16.060
Do me a favor,
start before that.

26:16.140 --> 26:19.268
Right, so about a year
and a half ago, Jordan Scott

26:19.340 --> 26:22.605
goes to see Dr. David Walton
for a minor procedure.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.045
He's inspired to read up
about him.

26:24.110 --> 26:26.044
He finds out
Walton has pioneered

26:26.110 --> 26:28.214
a surgical procedure
that can completely change

26:28.280 --> 26:30.885
the structure and look
of a patient's face.

26:32.190 --> 26:35.512
Sometime between then
and three months ago,

26:35.590 --> 26:37.512
Jordan hatches a plan

26:37.590 --> 26:39.956
where looking
like Gregory Chernov

26:40.030 --> 26:42.453
is essential.

26:42.530 --> 26:45.499
Lieutenant, do you have
any idea how crazy
this sounds?

26:45.570 --> 26:46.821
You're telling me
that a man walked

26:46.900 --> 26:48.299
into a doctor's office
and said,

26:48.370 --> 26:49.928
"Please make me look
like someone else."

26:50.000 --> 26:52.207
Besides, Dr. Walton
would never agree

26:52.270 --> 26:54.101
to risky surgery like this.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.001
Which is why Jordan
and Evan had to kidnap him

26:57.080 --> 26:58.945
and force him
to do the surgery.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.269
"Force him
to do the surgery"?

27:01.350 --> 27:04.649
So then they what,
kept him alive
in the apartment

27:04.720 --> 27:06.745
so he could treat Jordan?

27:06.820 --> 27:07.980
Exactly.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.722
Procedure like that,
it takes time to heal.

27:10.790 --> 27:14.590
Jordan needed Walton
to oversee his recovery,

27:14.660 --> 27:16.525
make sure he was okay.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.622
Then he killed him.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.099
And nobody noticed
the difference

27:20.170 --> 27:22.559
between the real Chernov
and the fake Chernov?

27:22.640 --> 27:24.062
Al, come on.

27:24.140 --> 27:27.109
This surgery couldn't
have gone perfect, right?

27:27.170 --> 27:29.274
It didn't have
to go perfect.

27:29.340 --> 27:32.002
Jordan, other than when
we interviewed him,

27:32.080 --> 27:34.810
worked from home
after the surgery.
He didn't talk to anyone.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.678
Gregory Chernov
ran a construction company.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.389
Why would anyone
go through all the trouble

27:41.460 --> 27:43.348
to impersonate him?

27:43.420 --> 27:45.581
We figure that out,

27:45.660 --> 27:46.854
we solve the case.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.861
Hey, Wells,
do you know much about
this plastic

27:54.940 --> 27:56.760
What are you trying
to say, Denny?

27:56.840 --> 27:58.603
I mean, obviously,
you've never thought
about it yourself.

27:58.670 --> 28:01.730
You can't enhance perfection,
but I don't know,
I've been thinking.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.471
Thinking about getting
a little work done?

28:03.540 --> 28:05.349
I mean, am I crazy?

28:05.410 --> 28:07.173
Tell me I'm crazy, please.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.808
No, I hear they're doing
incredible things

28:08.880 --> 28:10.745
with calf augmentation
these days.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.380
Okay, I get it.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.916
Jay told you.
It's very funny.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.548
You got anything?

28:17.620 --> 28:19.451
I mean, Jordan's long gone.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.623
What I can tell from,
from Chernov's current
work files,

28:21.700 --> 28:23.122
there's nothing in here
that would justify

28:23.200 --> 28:24.667
that type of plan, you know?

28:24.730 --> 28:25.867
Those pills.

28:30.370 --> 28:32.065
These allergies
are killing me.

28:33.340 --> 28:35.399
Not to mention
my damn celiac.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.175
I had a muffin
a couple of days ago.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.041
You can imagine
what happened.

28:47.490 --> 28:48.809
Oh, these are
just allergy medications.

28:48.890 --> 28:50.289
When Al and I were here,

28:50.360 --> 28:51.850
there were three bottles
on the table, okay?

28:51.930 --> 28:53.056
Not two.

28:53.130 --> 28:56.019
One of them
was marked Ca-DTPA.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.658
I'm betting
it wasn't for allergies.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.665
JAY: Carrie's right again.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.600
Ca-DTPA isn't
allergy medication.

29:05.670 --> 29:07.638
It's_ an antidote
to radiation exposure.

29:07.710 --> 29:09.007
Radiation exposure?

29:09.080 --> 29:11.241
High-volume
radiation exposure.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.743
If Jordan's taking
the antidote,

29:12.810 --> 29:14.641
it's a good bet
he's been in contact

29:14.720 --> 29:16.073
with radioactive material.

29:16.150 --> 29:17.845
And if you're trying
to get your hands

29:17.920 --> 29:19.888
on radioactive materials,
now, there's a reason
to concoct

29:19.950 --> 29:23.181
some crazy-ass plan
to reconstruct your face,
right?

29:23.260 --> 29:25.820
But what I don't get is,
why transform yourself

29:25.890 --> 29:27.585
into a guy who works
in construction?

29:27.660 --> 29:30.720
Mmm. I'm betting there's more
to Chernov than we know.

29:32.870 --> 29:33.962
What's that?

29:34.040 --> 29:36.133
I created a program
with a binary algorithm

29:36.200 --> 29:37.861
to cross-reference the data
from the documents

29:37.940 --> 29:39.908
that Carrie and Denny
recovered from
Chernov's office

29:39.970 --> 29:41.471
with all of Chernov's
construction holdings.

29:41.540 --> 29:42.677
Okay, and?

29:42.740 --> 29:44.708
Anyways,
what that means is,

29:44.780 --> 29:48.170
it looks like Gregory Chernov
has a storage facility

29:48.250 --> 29:49.615
that he's kept off
the books,

29:49.680 --> 29:51.545
200 square feet,
phone lines and everything.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.440
Construction guys
don't keep flophouses.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.317
Chernov was hiding something
in there.

29:55.390 --> 29:56.948
Jordan could be there
right now, boss.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.726
So could
the radioactive material.

29:58.790 --> 30:02.055
All right, call ESU,
download all of this to
Homeland.

30:02.130 --> 30:04.223
If this is as bad as I think,
they need to know.

30:04.300 --> 30:05.426
You got it.

30:11.740 --> 30:13.230
You're all clear.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.505
Nobody's here,
and no radiation
detected so far.

30:15.580 --> 30:16.933
Roger that.

30:52.710 --> 30:54.849
You found RPGS?

30:54.920 --> 30:57.889
Cases of them
from the former Soviet Army.

30:57.950 --> 30:59.747
Could be Chernov
is an extremist maybe?

30:59.820 --> 31:01.856
Or he's a capitalist,
right?

31:01.920 --> 31:03.410
I mean, it's a construction
company.

31:03.490 --> 31:05.629
It's the perfect
front for importing
and exporting weapons.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.226
That's why Jordan
would take over

31:07.290 --> 31:08.928
Chernov's identity.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.992
It also explains
how he came into contact
with radioactive material.

31:12.070 --> 31:15.039
If we're lucky,
that material is still inside.

31:15.100 --> 31:17.034
It looks like Jordan
was camping out here.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.637
He had a desk, a cot,
even a phone line.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.530
No sign
of any radioactive devices,

31:21.610 --> 31:23.942
but my tech did pick up
some low-level
Geiger readings.

31:24.010 --> 31:26.376
So something was in there,
and now it's gone?

31:26.450 --> 31:27.940
Yeah.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.477
You know,
Jorda_n can't be
working alone.

31:30.550 --> 31:33.587
Run down all the phone calls
he made from this facility.

31:33.650 --> 31:35.186
All right, you got it.

31:37.390 --> 31:39.119
Congratulations,
Lieutenant.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.657
For what?

31:40.730 --> 31:42.789
Very smart
looping Homeland in.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.964
I just got a call
from my contact.

31:45.030 --> 31:47.590
Seems like you and Carrie
inadvertently discovered

31:47.670 --> 31:49.763
the identity of
The Broker.

31:50.700 --> 31:51.769
The Broker?

31:51.840 --> 31:53.603
Yeah, apparently,
The Broker

31:53.670 --> 31:55.228
is a elusive,
high-powered figure

31:55.310 --> 31:57.949
in the international
military black market.

31:58.010 --> 32:01.741
Homeland's been trying
to verify this guy's
identity for years.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.742
That's why Jordan
needed a new identity.

32:03.820 --> 32:05.788
Whatever he's doing
with this radioactive
material,

32:05.850 --> 32:07.715
he's doing it as Chernov.

32:07.790 --> 32:09.610
Right, but what
I don't get is,

32:09.690 --> 32:12.056
if Chernov is about
to make a ton of cash

32:12.130 --> 32:13.950
by moving
radioactive material,

32:14.030 --> 32:17.193
why would Jordan
go through the trouble
to impersonate him, right?

32:17.260 --> 32:18.625
Just wait till Chernov
makes the deal,

32:18.700 --> 32:20.224
go in, grab him,
grab the dough.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.666
Unless Chernov
wasn't making the deal.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.799
Maybe he never had
the radioactive material.

32:25.670 --> 32:27.103
Maybe Jordan did,

32:27.170 --> 32:29.274
and he needed Chernov
to move it.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.900
Jay, you said
Jordan and Evan

32:31.980 --> 32:35.074
pulled jobs in six different
cities in the last five years.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.471
Could any of those
have given them access

32:37.550 --> 32:39.040
to weapons-grade
radioactive material?

32:39.120 --> 32:40.519
I'm on it, boss.

32:40.590 --> 32:42.114
Thanks.

32:42.190 --> 32:45.284
Let's just say
Jordan and Evan got their
hands on this stuff.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.453
What the hell would they do
with it on their own?

32:47.530 --> 32:49.657
They're not in the business
of moving WMDS,

32:49.730 --> 32:51.061
and anyone who is

32:51.130 --> 32:53.121
wouldn't trust those two
to make a deal.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.691
That's why they need
someone with credibility
in the black market.

32:55.770 --> 32:59.035
Right.
To make the deal
face-to-face.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.600
Ugh. Excuse the pun.

33:00.670 --> 33:03.002
Which is where _Dr. Walton
comes in.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.342
Yeah, Jay?

33:04.410 --> 33:06.002
Al, you're not
gonna believe this.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.014
A year ago, Jordan and Evan
pulled this scam

33:08.080 --> 33:10.014
at a university
out in Arizona.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.980
Now, they went in
as campus security guards,

33:12.050 --> 33:13.483
took down
a medical research lab,

33:13.550 --> 33:15.359
probably looking
for antibiotics or something.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.980
Turns out that lab
was at the forefront of
research

33:18.060 --> 33:20.449
into, get this,
radioactive isotopes

33:20.530 --> 33:21.724
for cancer research.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.995
Radioactive, like what goes
in a bomb radioactive?

33:24.070 --> 33:25.196
So hold on.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.226
I talked to my FBI guy.
He owes me a favor.

33:27.300 --> 33:28.858
He said the Bureau
kept quiet

33:28.940 --> 33:31.261
'cause it didn't want
to cause panic,
but the university

33:31.340 --> 33:33.308
reported a pound and a half

33:33.370 --> 33:35.008
of fissionable cobalt-70

33:35.080 --> 33:36.900
went unaccounted for
after the theft.

33:36.980 --> 33:38.777
Now, that's not enough
for a bomb,

33:38.850 --> 33:40.943
but it sure as hell gets you
off to a good start.

33:41.010 --> 33:42.978
Any idea what it's worth?

33:43.050 --> 33:44.540
JAY: Uh...

33:44.620 --> 33:47.612
Estimated black-market value
is around $4 million.

33:48.590 --> 33:50.410
Thanks, Jay.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.287
We've been trying
to figure out why
somebody would go

33:52.360 --> 33:54.692
through the trouble
of getting a new face.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.125
How does $4 million sound?

33:59.070 --> 34:01.265
All right, cool.
Thank you.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.898
Hey.
Hey, Jay Bones.

34:02.970 --> 34:04.562
What are you doing here, man?
I wasn't about
to miss the action

34:04.640 --> 34:05.868
and let you guys have
all the fun.

34:05.940 --> 34:08.238
So, uh, what is
going on here?

34:08.310 --> 34:09.572
I just talked to Russo.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.107
They're saying Homeland's
hearing a bunch of chatter

34:11.180 --> 34:13.569
about a multimillion-dollar
sale of cobalt-70.

34:13.650 --> 34:16.141
They're saying
it's happening in the city,
and that it is imminent.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.142
I mean imminent
with a capital I, bro.

34:18.220 --> 34:20.484
Holy smokes.
Okay, all right, all right.

34:20.550 --> 34:23.383
So, if this construction guy
Chernov was The Broker,

34:23.460 --> 34:24.882
he's still just
the middleman, right?

34:24.960 --> 34:27.258
The deal's not done
until he passes the stuff off

34:27.330 --> 34:28.649
to the people who plan
to use it.

34:28.730 --> 34:30.220
So have you guys
got anything on this?

34:30.300 --> 34:31.597
Honestly nothing.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.921
We got, we got Jordan's
phone records

34:33.000 --> 34:34.592
from inside this place,
but it's nothing exciting.

34:34.670 --> 34:36.160
The guy's just lazing around,

34:36.240 --> 34:37.889
ordering takeout twice a day
from the same bakery.

34:37.970 --> 34:40.029
A bakery?
Yeah, uh, Syrena Bakery.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.429
It's a little,
local sandwich shop.

34:41.510 --> 34:42.704
Actually,
it's pretty good.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.702
Jordan's got celiac disease.

34:44.780 --> 34:46.839
So?
So, if a guy can't eat bread,

34:46.910 --> 34:48.673
what's he doing
ordering sandwiches
twice a day?

34:48.750 --> 34:50.570
I don't know. Maybe Evan
was making the orders.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.618
Can't be him, 'cause Evan
was working construction

34:52.690 --> 34:54.214
and living in his apartment
till yesterday.

34:54.290 --> 34:56.611
Bro, I hate to rain
on your theory, but come on.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.123
Maybe the place
makes a mean salad.

34:58.190 --> 34:59.327
Maybe he was
ordering that.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.199
I know
that place too, Denny.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.898
It ain't exactly
a salad kind of joint.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.758
You know what?
I'm gonna look
into this Syrena place.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.229
Okay.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.562
Why is Jay here?

35:10.640 --> 35:12.733
Oh, well,
he's my partner.

35:12.810 --> 35:15.278
Would you ask Starsky
the same question
about Hutch?

35:15.340 --> 35:16.705
A, you need
to update your reference,

35:16.780 --> 35:18.668
and, B, Jordan just made
a withdrawal,

35:18.750 --> 35:21.344
ATM, $200,
Grand Central Station.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.047
You don't think
he's actually gonna
make the drop, do you?

35:23.120 --> 35:24.917
No, I think he knows
that we're onto him,

35:24.990 --> 35:26.287
and _the withdrawal
was just a diver5ion.

35:26.350 --> 35:27.544
Hey, boss.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.156
I think I got something
on the sandwich joint

35:29.220 --> 35:30.414
that Jordan
was ordering from.

35:30.490 --> 35:31.855
The owners of
Syrena Bakery

35:31.930 --> 35:34.319
are two brothers,
Kareem and Malik Hakimi.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.220
Check that.
Oh.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.790
Egyptian expatriates

35:37.860 --> 35:40.624
with ties to _several terrorist
watch list groups?

35:40.700 --> 35:42.497
What if Jordan
wasn't ordering food,

35:42.570 --> 35:43.935
he was arranging the drop?

36:34.890 --> 36:36.357
Hey, Denny.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.887
Traffic cam down the block
caught Jordan

36:37.960 --> 36:39.359
going into the bakery
a few minutes ago.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.954
He was carrying
a high-tech briefcase.

36:41.030 --> 36:42.998
Deal's going down now, man.
We need to get in there.

36:43.060 --> 36:45.722
Okay, Carrie and A!
have things under control,
okay?

36:45.800 --> 36:48.268
Cobalt-70 is extremely
unstable stuff.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.228
It could level
the entire block
if we go in shooting.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.165
What are we supposed to do,
wait for the transaction

36:52.240 --> 36:54.208
to go down
and pick everyone up
on their way out?

36:54.280 --> 36:56.976
Jay, if these are smart guys,
they're coming out with force.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.008
We're gonna be outgunned.
Where's our backup?

36:59.080 --> 37:00.547
They're
a couple minutes out.

37:00.610 --> 37:01.975
See, this could be over
by then.

37:02.050 --> 37:03.745
Listen, we need
to get closer,

37:03.820 --> 37:04.844
and we need to
draw Jordan out,
you understand?

37:04.920 --> 37:06.080
Denny,
you got to trust me.

37:07.090 --> 37:09.058
Carrie and Al
have a plan.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.452
What is their plan?

37:11.530 --> 37:13.486
They're going
to get a sandwich.

37:20.830 --> 37:23.162
Ah, Mr. Chernov.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.128
So nice to see you again.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.337
We were getting worried
you'd made other plans.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.037
Oh, sorry I'm late.

37:29.110 --> 37:30.907
Thanks for meeting me
in person.

37:32.110 --> 37:33.543
Get Mr. Chernov
some water.

37:33.610 --> 37:36.272
You don't sound so good.
No, it's just allergies.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.182
Let's get down to business.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.081
I take it
that's the package.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.089
Can we see it?

37:47.460 --> 37:48.529
You first.

38:05.180 --> 38:07.102
MAN: $4 million...

38:08.080 --> 38:09.445
Just as we agreed.

38:19.090 --> 38:20.318
Allah Hu Akbar.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.420
It's beautiful.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.264
Your methods are unusual,
but we cannot complain
about the results.

38:29.170 --> 38:31.195
Thank you.
I'll be on my way.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.766
CARRIE: Tell me right now!

38:35.140 --> 38:37.005
Wait here.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.344
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, who is she?

38:39.410 --> 38:41.469
There's nobody else,
baby, only you.

38:41.550 --> 38:43.211
I know what you're up to
with that little Slut.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.316
Chrissy Thomas
and I work together,
that's it!

38:45.390 --> 38:46.948
IS that why she calls
at 2:00 am?

38:47.020 --> 38:50.012
IS it? Is that why
Barbara saw you
at the coffee shop

38:50.090 --> 38:51.955
with your tongue
down her throat?

38:52.030 --> 38:53.327
AL: Come on.

38:53.390 --> 38:55.950
Excuse me,
I think you should
take this outside.

38:56.030 --> 38:58.419
Ah, you thought
I wouldn't create
a public disturbance.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.422
How did that work out
for you?

39:00.500 --> 39:01.967
I need to do my makeup!
Move!

39:02.040 --> 39:03.928
I am sorry about this.
My girlfriend gets
a little...

39:04.000 --> 39:05.536
Don't apologize for me!
Nuts sometimes.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.009
_ I am not nuts!
Still can't help lovmg her.

39:07.070 --> 39:09.300
Love her outside,
or I call the police.

39:09.380 --> 39:13.077
You know what?
That is a really,
really good.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.515
I'm gonna call
the police myself,

39:14.580 --> 39:16.172
because cheating
is a crime!

39:17.680 --> 39:19.944
Hello, I would like
to report a domestic
disturbance

39:20.020 --> 39:21.385
at Syrena Bakery.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.950
Damn it,
I need to leave.

39:25.790 --> 39:27.428
Everything okay,
Mr. Chernov?

39:29.500 --> 39:30.797
You don't look so good.

39:38.670 --> 39:40.399
12 East...
I told you to leave!

39:41.610 --> 39:43.202
Don't move!

39:46.650 --> 39:48.971
You know what will happen
if I drop this suitcase?

39:50.450 --> 39:52.315
Everyone in here dies.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.271
Drop your gun. Drop it!

40:58.590 --> 41:00.581
Jordan Scott,
you are under arrest.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.408
You might want to get
some work done on that nose,

41:04.490 --> 41:06.185
you know, if you're
into that kind of thing.

41:13.230 --> 41:15.369
(INDISTINCT CHA'I'I'ER
OVER POLICE RADIO)

41:15.440 --> 41:17.032
Nice job role-playing
in there.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.159
You still
can't get over the fact

41:19.240 --> 41:21.162
that I dated Chrissy Thomas
back then.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.605
That's absolutely untrue.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.545
I was simply giving you
a real name to work with.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.146
Oh, no kidding?

41:26.210 --> 41:28.201
Well, I'm not the one
with the perfect memory,

41:28.280 --> 41:29.417
but that sure sounded
like the fight

41:29.480 --> 41:30.674
we had about her back then.

41:30.750 --> 41:33.412
You're as wrong now as you
were on August 24, 2001.

41:33.490 --> 41:34.855
For the millionth time...
Yeah?

41:34.920 --> 41:36.353
I dated her before you.

41:36.420 --> 41:37.557
How can you hold that
against me?

41:37.620 --> 41:38.723
I'm not holding it
against you.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.326
I'm perfectly capable
of getting over things.

41:40.390 --> 41:42.426
In fact, I'm over it.
Over it!
Oh, I'm impressed.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.559
Thank you.

41:44.630 --> 41:46.564
I wonder what happened
to Chrissy.

41:46.630 --> 41:47.858
Boy, She was great.

41:47.930 --> 41:50.160
You know,
you can play it cool
all you want, A! Burns,

41:50.240 --> 41:51.491
but here's the truth.

41:51.570 --> 41:53.561
You revealed
your true feelings
back in there.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.972
Yeah, you're right,
by saving the city
from disaster.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.235
No, you told Kareem
that you love me!

41:58.310 --> 42:00.175
Oh, come on.
I was just role-playing.

42:00.250 --> 42:02.514
Really, role
So you didn't mean it?

42:02.580 --> 42:04.411
I meant it when I said
you're totally nuts.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.788
I am nuts, but you love it.

42:05.850 --> 42:07.511
Yeah, I kind of do.
