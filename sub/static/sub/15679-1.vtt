01:21:34.529 --> 01:21:37.006
that almost breaks my back, but...

01:21:38.325 --> 01:21:40.443
I tell myself,

01:21:40.803 --> 01:21:44.039
"When you owe your life to someone,

01:21:45.638 --> 01:21:47.436
you better live it."

01:21:48.595 --> 01:21:52.071
So, I just say...

01:21:55.068 --> 01:21:56.467
"Thank you."
