WEBVTT

00:07.709 --> 00:09.334
GUYS, LISTEN UP.

00:09.375 --> 00:11.334
YOU KNOW HOW OLIVER'S

00:09.375 --> 00:11.334
ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING NICE

00:11.375 --> 00:14.000
FOR EVERYONE ELSE

00:11.375 --> 00:14.000
BUT HE NEVER EXPECTS

00:11.375 --> 00:14.000
ANYTHING IN RETURN?

00:14.042 --> 00:17.125
YEAH. IT'S REALLY

00:14.042 --> 00:17.125
THE BEST PART ABOUT HIM.

00:17.167 --> 00:19.876
I THINK WE SHOULD DO

00:17.167 --> 00:19.876
SOMETHING FOR HIM

00:17.167 --> 00:19.876
FOR A CHANGE.

00:19.918 --> 00:22.459
SO I'M THROWING HIM

00:19.918 --> 00:22.459
A SURPRISE PARTY FOR

00:19.918 --> 00:22.459
HIS BIRTHDAY TONIGHT.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.000
REALLY? I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

00:22.500 --> 00:26.000
TO GO TO A SURPRISE PARTY.

00:26.042 --> 00:28.918
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

00:26.042 --> 00:28.918
NO ONE SAY A WORD ABOUT THIS.

00:28.959 --> 00:30.250
OKAY, SO,

00:28.959 --> 00:30.250
HERE'S THE PLAN.

00:32.083 --> 00:34.542
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

00:32.083 --> 00:34.542
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN THE SURPRISE.

00:34.584 --> 00:37.375
I HAVE TO TELL YOU

00:34.584 --> 00:37.375
ABOUT THE PARTY.

00:38.542 --> 00:40.542
RIGHT.

00:40.584 --> 00:43.876
SORRY. I'M NEW AT THIS.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.542
WAIT. OLIVER'S BIRTHDAY

00:43.918 --> 00:46.542
ISN'T FOR THREE MONTHS.

00:46.584 --> 00:48.584
I REMEMBER THE EXACT DAY

00:46.584 --> 00:48.584
BECAUSE IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY

00:48.626 --> 00:51.584
OF WHEN I REALIZED

00:48.626 --> 00:51.584
I DO LIKE TOAST,

00:51.626 --> 00:54.500
DESPITE WHAT

00:51.626 --> 00:54.500
EVERYONE SAID.

00:54.542 --> 00:57.375
EVERY YEAR, I TRY TO

00:54.542 --> 00:57.375
SURPRISE OLIVER ON

00:54.542 --> 00:57.375
HIS BIRTHDAY,

00:57.417 --> 00:59.459
BUT HE ALWAYS

00:57.417 --> 00:59.459
FIGURES IT OUT.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.709
SO I'M HAVING

00:59.500 --> 01:01.709
THE PARTY TONIGHT

00:59.500 --> 01:01.709
SO HE'LL NEVER EXPECT IT.

01:01.751 --> 01:03.626
NEVER EXPECT WHAT?

01:03.667 --> 01:06.375
UH, UH, NEVER EXPECT THIS.

01:08.042 --> 01:10.292
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA DO THAT.

01:08.042 --> 01:10.292
YOU CAN'T SURPRISE ME.

01:10.334 --> 01:12.584
ANYWAY, BUDDY,

01:10.334 --> 01:12.584
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE,

01:12.626 --> 01:15.959
- BECAUSE I NEED

01:12.626 --> 01:15.959
YOU TO LEAVE.

01:12.626 --> 01:15.959
- WHY?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.042
BECAUSE YOUR PRESENCE

01:16.000 --> 01:19.042
COMPROMISES THE MISSION.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.500
WHICH IS TO GO TO

01:19.083 --> 01:21.500
THE CAFETERIA

01:21.542 --> 01:24.334
TO GET GUS SOME...

01:24.375 --> 01:26.500
TOAST!

01:26.542 --> 01:29.042
SEE, I TOLD YOU

01:26.542 --> 01:29.042
I LIKED IT.

01:29.083 --> 01:30.918
WHY CAN'T HE

01:29.083 --> 01:30.918
GET IT HIMSELF?

01:30.959 --> 01:35.042
BECAUSE HE'S TOO WEAK

01:30.959 --> 01:35.042
FROM THE LACK OF TOAST.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.292
WE'RE NOT GONNA

01:35.083 --> 01:36.292
LEAVE HIM ALONE,

01:36.334 --> 01:38.042
NOT IN THIS

01:36.334 --> 01:38.042
TOASTLESS STATE.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.250
OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GO.

01:40.292 --> 01:42.167
STOP PUSHING ME.

01:42.209 --> 01:44.542
OKAY, SO HERE'S THE PLAN.

01:44.584 --> 01:46.667
CLYDE AGREED TO LET US

01:44.584 --> 01:46.667
USE THE DOMAIN FOR THE PARTY.

01:46.709 --> 01:48.959
I'LL KEEP OLIVER AWAY

01:46.709 --> 01:48.959
UNTIL 7:00.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.125
YOU GUYS SET EVERYTHING UP

01:49.000 --> 01:51.125
AND GET THE DECORATIONS READY.

01:51.167 --> 01:53.042
OH, READY FOR WHAT?

01:53.083 --> 01:55.959
UH, UH, READY FOR THIS.

02:00.459 --> 02:02.167
SERIOUSLY?

02:02.209 --> 02:04.042
HOW COME YOU'RE

02:02.209 --> 02:04.042
STILL HERE?

02:04.083 --> 02:07.334
I JUST REMEMBERED

02:04.083 --> 02:07.334
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.459
NEVER MIND.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.459
I DON'T NEED TOAST.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.000
I HAVE SOME IN

02:09.500 --> 02:11.000
MY BACKPACK.

02:13.375 --> 02:15.626
OH, YOU GUYS WERE RIGHT.

02:15.667 --> 02:17.667

03:13.709 --> 03:15.250
FIRST BALLOONS

03:15.292 --> 03:18.042
WERE MADE OF

03:15.292 --> 03:18.042
AIR-FILLED PIG BLADDERS.

03:18.083 --> 03:20.042
I WANT THIS PARTY

03:18.083 --> 03:20.042
TO BE GREAT,

03:20.083 --> 03:21.292

03:25.083 --> 03:29.626
PIG BLADDERS.

03:25.083 --> 03:29.626
THESE ARE GOAT BLADDERS.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.626
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:31.667 --> 03:34.626
WELL, YOU HAVE THE SUPERHEROES

03:31.667 --> 03:34.626
ARRANGED ALPHABETICALLY.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.667
I LIKE THEM ARRANGED IN

03:34.667 --> 03:36.667
THE ORDER I'M GONNA

03:36.709 --> 03:38.083
HUNT THEM DOWN

03:36.709 --> 03:38.083
AND MASSACRE THEM.

03:38.125 --> 03:41.042
EXCEPT FOR THIS GUY.

03:38.125 --> 03:41.042
I LIKE HIS CAPE.

03:41.083 --> 03:44.292
HIM I'M JUST GONNA TORTURE.

03:44.334 --> 03:46.500
ACTUALLY, I NEED TO

03:44.334 --> 03:46.500
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.542
UH, I PLANNED

03:46.542 --> 03:48.542
A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

03:48.584 --> 03:51.042
OH, A PARTY.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.667
YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE

03:51.083 --> 03:53.667
GOAT BLADDER BALLOONS.

03:53.709 --> 03:57.250
IT'S NOT A PARTY.

03:53.709 --> 03:57.250
IT'S AN INTERVENTION.

03:57.292 --> 03:58.626
A WHAT?

03:58.667 --> 04:00.709
ALL OF THESE FORMER VILLAINS

04:00.751 --> 04:03.125
HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT,

04:00.751 --> 04:03.125
AND THEY'VE CHANGED

04:00.751 --> 04:03.125
THEIR EVIL WAYS.

04:03.167 --> 04:07.042
HI, I'M ED,

04:03.167 --> 04:07.042
FORMERLY THE EXTERMINATOR,

04:07.083 --> 04:10.209
NOW JUST AN EXTERMINATOR.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.751
THAT ONE'S ON THE HOUSE.

04:16.209 --> 04:17.416
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

04:17.459 --> 04:19.750
CLYDE, I WANNA

04:17.459 --> 04:19.750
TURN NON-EVIL,

04:19.791 --> 04:21.334
AND I THINK

04:19.791 --> 04:21.334
YOU SHOULD, TOO.

04:21.375 --> 04:25.417
THE NON-VILLAIN WORLD

04:21.375 --> 04:25.417
CAN BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL.

04:25.459 --> 04:28.626
JUST THE OTHER DAY,

04:25.459 --> 04:28.626
I HELPED AN OLD LADY

04:25.459 --> 04:28.626
ACROSS THE STREET

04:28.667 --> 04:30.792
INSTEAD OF PUSHING HER

04:28.667 --> 04:30.792
INTO THE STREET.

04:30.834 --> 04:34.751
SHE SAID THANKS

04:30.834 --> 04:34.751
INSTEAD OF ( screams ).

04:34.792 --> 04:37.500
IT WAS REALLY NICE.

04:37.542 --> 04:38.667
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

04:38.709 --> 04:41.042
I AM A VILLAIN

04:38.709 --> 04:41.042
THROUGH AND THROUGH.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.209
I LIKE MY VICTIMS

04:41.083 --> 04:43.209
LIKE I LIKE MY COFFEE--

04:43.250 --> 04:46.792
GROUND TO A FINE POWDER

04:43.250 --> 04:46.792
AND STRAINED THROUGH

04:43.250 --> 04:46.792
A PAPER FILTER.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.751
JUST HEAR US OUT, OKAY?

04:48.792 --> 04:52.125
I MEAN, FOR CATERING,

04:48.792 --> 04:52.125
I ORDERED YOUR FAVORITE

04:48.792 --> 04:52.125
ANTI-HERO SANDWICHES.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.751
- ANTI-HERO SANDWICHES?

04:52.167 --> 04:53.751
- YES.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.792
FROM THE PLACE WITH

04:53.792 --> 04:55.792
THE ARCH-NEMI-SHISK KEBABS?

04:55.834 --> 04:56.751
YES.

04:56.792 --> 05:00.042
OKAY, I GUESS IT

04:56.792 --> 05:00.042
COULDN'T HURT

05:00.083 --> 05:02.667
- TO HEAR YOU ALL OUT.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.667
- GREAT. FIRST THINGS FIRST.

05:02.709 --> 05:04.083
LET'S GET RID OF

05:02.709 --> 05:04.083
ALL THOSE KIDS OVER THERE.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.542
THERE ARE ANY NUMBER

05:04.125 --> 05:06.542
OF SPRAYS OR GLUE TRAPS

05:06.584 --> 05:09.083
THAT'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT,

05:06.584 --> 05:09.083
OR I CAN STOMP ON 'EM.

05:11.125 --> 05:12.918
WE CANNOT GET RID

05:11.125 --> 05:12.918
OF THOSE KIDS.

05:12.959 --> 05:15.042
I'VE RENTED THEM

05:12.959 --> 05:15.042
THE DOMAIN TONIGHT

05:12.959 --> 05:15.042
FOR 50 BUCKS.

05:15.083 --> 05:17.209
AND THEN, I SPENT

05:15.083 --> 05:17.209
ALL THAT MONEY

05:15.083 --> 05:17.209
ON CAR WAX.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.459
WE DON'T EVEN

05:17.250 --> 05:18.459
HAVE A CAR.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.792
NOT YET, BUT WHEN WE DO,

05:19.834 --> 05:21.667
IT'S GONNA BE SO SHINY.

05:21.709 --> 05:23.876
PA-PA-POW.

05:23.918 --> 05:26.459
WHY CAN'T WE JUST

05:23.918 --> 05:26.459
RELOCATE THE INTERVENTION?

05:26.500 --> 05:29.209
YOU WANNA TELL

05:26.500 --> 05:29.209
DISEMBOWELER WE HAVE

05:26.500 --> 05:29.209
TO RELOCATE?

05:29.250 --> 05:31.792
YES, HE'S REFORMED,

05:29.250 --> 05:31.792
BUT HE STILL HAS

05:29.250 --> 05:31.792
BLADES FOR FINGERS.

05:31.834 --> 05:33.792
WHAT'S UP, KEITH?

05:35.542 --> 05:37.459
LOOKING SHARP.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.334
LISTEN, FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,

05:43.375 --> 05:45.292
IT SEEMS YOU'RE IN

05:43.375 --> 05:45.292
A COMPLETE STATE OF SHOCK.

05:45.334 --> 05:47.667
SO YOU'RE BACK

05:45.334 --> 05:47.667
TO NORMAL, SERGE.

05:49.292 --> 05:50.792
MY PHONE'S DEAD.

05:52.709 --> 05:54.459
THANKS, DUDE.

05:57.459 --> 05:59.542
HEY, OLIVER,

05:57.459 --> 05:59.542
IT'S 6:45.

05:59.584 --> 06:01.250
WE NEED TO GET

05:59.584 --> 06:01.250
TO THE DOMAIN.

06:01.292 --> 06:03.000
WHY? WE'RE WORKING HERE.

06:03.042 --> 06:04.918
NO, WE HAVE TO GO

06:03.042 --> 06:04.918
BECAUSE, UH,

06:04.959 --> 06:06.709
THE DOMAIN IS HAVING

06:04.959 --> 06:06.709

06:18.167 --> 06:19.751
IT'S A TWO-FOR-TARDY

06:18.167 --> 06:19.751
TUESDAY.

06:19.792 --> 06:22.667
WHY WOULD WALLACE

06:19.792 --> 06:22.667
AND CLYDE DO THAT?

06:22.709 --> 06:25.167
TO REWARD TARDINESS.

06:25.209 --> 06:27.709
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU

06:25.209 --> 06:27.709
JUST GO WITHOUT ME?

06:27.751 --> 06:29.667
YOU HAVE TO

06:27.751 --> 06:29.667
COME WITH ME.

06:29.709 --> 06:31.542
IT WON'T BE THE SAME

06:29.709 --> 06:31.542
WITHOUT YOU.

06:31.584 --> 06:34.709
YOU KNOW, WE ONLY HAVE

06:31.584 --> 06:34.709
SO MANY YEARS LEFT

06:34.751 --> 06:36.751
TO DO THESE THINGS

06:34.751 --> 06:36.751
TOGETHER, OLIVER.

06:36.792 --> 06:40.375
ONE DAY, YOU'LL WAKE UP

06:36.792 --> 06:40.375
OLD AND ALONE,

06:40.417 --> 06:43.959
AND SAY TO YOUR ROBOTIC

06:40.417 --> 06:43.959
NURSEMAID, SHEILA X99,

06:44.000 --> 06:48.500
I WOULD'VE LOVED TO HAVE

06:44.000 --> 06:48.500
GONE TO THE DOMAIN WITH

06:44.000 --> 06:48.500
KAZ MORE OFTEN.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.167
AND THEN SHE'LL SAY,

06:48.542 --> 06:52.167
WHAT IS LOVE?

06:52.209 --> 06:55.709
BECAUSE SHE'S A ROBOT,

06:52.209 --> 06:55.709
AND SHE FEELS NOTHING.

06:55.751 --> 06:57.542
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

07:03.083 --> 07:06.167
- ( alarm blaring )

07:03.083 --> 07:06.167
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

07:06.209 --> 07:08.042
THE HOSPITAL'S GONE

07:06.209 --> 07:08.042
INTO LOCKDOWN.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.667
EITHER SOMEONE'S TRYING

07:08.083 --> 07:09.667
TO BREAK INTO MIGHTY MED,

07:09.709 --> 07:11.918
OR IT'S A FALSE ALARM.

07:11.959 --> 07:14.250
OR I FORGOT TO PAY

07:11.959 --> 07:14.250
THE ALARM COMPANY.

07:14.292 --> 07:16.000
OR THE FALSE ALARM COMPANY.

07:16.042 --> 07:18.459
HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA

07:16.042 --> 07:18.459
BE STUCK HERE?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.834
WE JUST NEED TO WAIT FOR

07:18.500 --> 07:20.834
THE SYSTEM TO RESET ITSELF.

07:20.876 --> 07:23.042
SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE

07:20.876 --> 07:23.042
THAN FIVE MINUTES.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.709
UNLESS IT TAKES A WEEK.

07:26.292 --> 07:28.417
OKAY, THEY'LL BE HERE

07:26.292 --> 07:28.417
IN FIVE MINUTES.

07:28.459 --> 07:30.667
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,

07:30.709 --> 07:33.459
WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE

07:30.709 --> 07:33.459
CHANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.209
ARE YOU NOT LISTENING

07:33.500 --> 07:36.209
TO ME, McKENNA?

07:39.709 --> 07:42.000
NOW LET'S GET INTO POSITIONS

07:39.709 --> 07:42.000
AND PRACTICE

07:42.042 --> 07:45.042
OPERATION SURPRISE OLIVER.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.042
WHY DO WE HAVE

07:45.083 --> 07:47.042
TO PRACTICE?

07:47.083 --> 07:49.667
HOW HARD IS IT?

07:47.083 --> 07:49.667
OLIVER WALKS IN,

07:49.709 --> 07:52.542
AND WE YELL,

07:49.709 --> 07:52.542
GET HIM!!

07:53.876 --> 07:55.792
YEAH, WE SHOULD PRACTICE.

07:55.834 --> 07:58.834
SEE, CLYDE, LIVING

07:55.834 --> 07:58.834
A LAW-ABIDING LIFE

07:58.876 --> 08:01.584
CAN BE QUITE FULFILLING.

07:58.876 --> 08:01.584
THANK YOU, DISEMBOWELER,

08:01.626 --> 08:04.751
FOR SHARING YOUR SCRAPBOOKING

08:01.626 --> 08:04.751
WITH US.

08:06.292 --> 08:09.375
YEAH, LOOK, I'M GLAD

08:06.292 --> 08:09.375
YOU FOUND HAPPINESS

08:09.417 --> 08:12.626
AS A HAIRDRESSER,

08:12.667 --> 08:15.042
BUT I THINK I'LL STICK

08:12.667 --> 08:15.042
WITH BEING A VILLAIN, OKAY?

08:15.083 --> 08:17.042
WHY? SO YOU CAN END UP

08:15.083 --> 08:17.042
LIKE REVENGEANCE,

08:17.083 --> 08:18.751
WHOSE SOUL WAS EXPELLED

08:17.083 --> 08:18.751
FROM HIS BODY

08:18.792 --> 08:21.209
DURING A BATTLE

08:18.792 --> 08:21.209
WITH TECTON?

08:21.250 --> 08:24.000
YOU WANNA BE A DISEMBODIED

08:21.250 --> 08:24.000
CLOUD OBSESSED WITH

08:21.250 --> 08:24.000
REGAINING YOUR HUMAN FORM

08:24.042 --> 08:25.042
SO YOU CAN TAKE

08:24.042 --> 08:25.042
OVER THE WORLD?

08:25.083 --> 08:26.959
UH, YEAH.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.792
WE'RE GETTING OFF POINT HERE.

08:28.834 --> 08:31.000
ED, DO YOU WANNA

08:28.834 --> 08:31.000
SHARE YOUR STORY WITH EVERYONE?

08:34.792 --> 08:36.292
YOU SEE THAT GUY?

08:36.333 --> 08:38.708
THAT WAS ME

08:36.333 --> 08:38.708
TEN YEARS AGO.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.833
THE EXTERMINATOR.

08:40.876 --> 08:42.792
YEAH, I LOOKED PRETTY COOL.

08:42.833 --> 08:46.375
BUT I WAS NEVER HAPPY,

08:42.833 --> 08:46.375
NOT EVEN AS A KID.

08:46.417 --> 08:49.334
I HAD NO FRIENDS, NEVER GOT

08:46.417 --> 08:49.334
INVITED TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY,

08:49.375 --> 08:51.334
NEVER EVEN HAD

08:49.375 --> 08:51.334
ONE OF MY OWN.

08:51.375 --> 08:55.626
GRANTED, I EXTERMINATED

08:51.375 --> 08:55.626
EVERYONE IN MY HOMETOWN,

08:55.667 --> 08:58.417
WHICH SERIOUSLY REDUCED

08:55.667 --> 08:58.417
THE NUMBER OF PARTIES,

08:58.459 --> 08:59.792
BUT...

08:59.834 --> 09:02.042
ANYWAY, I HAVE

08:59.834 --> 09:02.042
COME TO TERMS

09:02.083 --> 09:05.042
WITH MY RAGE

09:02.083 --> 09:05.042
AND DISAPPOINTMENT.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.000
IN FACT, TODAY

09:05.083 --> 09:07.000
IS MY BIRTHDAY.

09:07.042 --> 09:08.667
ANOTHER YEAR

09:07.042 --> 09:08.667
WITHOUT A PARTY,

09:08.709 --> 09:12.250
AND I AM COMPLETELY

09:08.709 --> 09:12.250
AT PEACE WITH IT.

09:12.292 --> 09:13.667
THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:13.709 --> 09:16.834
SURPRISE!

09:16.876 --> 09:19.417
I AM STUNNED.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.459
THIS WHOLE THING

09:19.459 --> 09:21.459
WAS A TRICK

09:21.500 --> 09:24.083
TO GET ME TO COME TO

09:21.500 --> 09:24.083
MY OWN SURPRISE PARTY?

09:24.125 --> 09:26.500
OH, IT HAPPENED!

09:26.542 --> 09:29.876
IT FINALLY HAPPENED!

09:29.918 --> 09:32.500
OH, THIS ISN'T FOR YOU.

09:32.542 --> 09:35.000
IT'S A PARTY FOR

09:32.542 --> 09:35.000
MY FRIEND OLIVER,

09:32.542 --> 09:35.000
AND YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.834
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE,

09:35.042 --> 09:38.834
BUT NOT YOU.

09:38.876 --> 09:42.792
OVER THERE, WHEE!

09:42.834 --> 09:44.667
OVER HERE, WAH!

09:46.083 --> 09:47.542
BUT HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

09:54.042 --> 09:56.500
HORACE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

09:54.042 --> 09:56.500
WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.626
YOU SURE THERE'S EVEN

09:56.542 --> 09:58.626
A SECURITY THREAT?

09:58.667 --> 10:00.667
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.667
THE SYSTEM'S

09:58.667 --> 10:00.667
VERY SENSITIVE.

10:00.709 --> 10:03.459
IT CAN BE TRIGGERED BY

10:00.709 --> 10:03.459
ANY THREAT, NO MATTER

10:00.709 --> 10:03.459
HOW SMALL.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.834
SOMETIMES IT'S TRIGGERED

10:03.500 --> 10:06.834
BY THINGS THAT AREN'T

10:03.500 --> 10:06.834
EVEN THREATS AT ALL.

10:06.876 --> 10:09.751
A SUMMER BREEZE, MOTHS,

10:06.876 --> 10:09.751
OR HATEFUL WORDS.

10:09.792 --> 10:13.626
A STUPID SUMMER BREEZE

10:09.792 --> 10:13.626
JUST BLEW A BUNCH OF MOTHS IN,

10:13.667 --> 10:15.751
AND THEY ATE HOLES

10:13.667 --> 10:15.751
IN MY FAVORITE VEST.

10:15.792 --> 10:18.626
- I HATE THOSE MOTHS!

10:15.792 --> 10:18.626
- ( alarm blares )

10:20.417 --> 10:22.375
OLIVER, I JUST

10:20.417 --> 10:22.375
FIGURED OUT A WAY

10:22.417 --> 10:24.042
TO GET US OUT OF HERE

10:22.417 --> 10:24.042
SO WE CAN GET TO THE DOMAIN.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.792
NO, WE SHOULD STAY.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.042
I DON'T WANNA

10:25.834 --> 10:27.042
GET IN TROUBLE.

10:27.083 --> 10:29.500
PLUS, SOLAR FLARE'S

10:27.083 --> 10:29.500
MAKING KETTLE CORN.

10:31.834 --> 10:34.042
YOU HAVE TO

10:31.834 --> 10:34.042
COME WITH ME.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.042
WON'T BE THE SAME

10:34.083 --> 10:36.042
WITHOUT YOU.

10:36.083 --> 10:40.042
WE ONLY HAVE SO MANY

10:36.083 --> 10:40.042
YEARS LEFT TO DO THESE

10:36.083 --> 10:40.042
THINGS TOGETHER, OLIVER.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.876
FINE, I'LL GO.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.042
KAZ, I DON'T THINK

10:43.500 --> 10:46.042
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.083
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.042
THIS IS HOW MY BROTHER

10:48.125 --> 10:50.042
GOT OUT OF JAIL.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.042
ALSO INTO JAIL.

10:53.083 --> 10:55.042
NO ONE WILL EVEN

10:53.083 --> 10:55.042
KNOW WE'RE LEAVING.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.792
WHY ARE YOU GUYS LEAVING?

10:59.083 --> 11:01.709
WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

11:01.751 --> 11:04.042
IS MY UNCLE HORACE

11:01.751 --> 11:04.042
MAKING YOU CLEAN OUT

11:01.751 --> 11:04.042
THE VENTILATION SYSTEM?

11:04.083 --> 11:05.542
- NO.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.542
- YES.

11:05.584 --> 11:07.042
- YES.

11:05.584 --> 11:07.042
- NO.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.042
- NO.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.042
- YES.

11:08.083 --> 11:10.000
Both: MAYBE.

11:11.959 --> 11:14.000
OKAY, YOUR STORY CHECKS OUT.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.417
BUT WATCH YOUR STEP,

11:17.459 --> 11:19.000
BECAUSE NOTHING

11:17.459 --> 11:19.000
GETS PAST ME.

11:19.042 --> 11:20.959
NOTHING!

11:23.751 --> 11:25.083
KAZ, FORGET IT.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.083
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.834
YES. YES, YOU ARE.

11:27.876 --> 11:29.083
THIS IS REALLY

11:27.876 --> 11:29.083
IMPORTANT TO ME.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.459
- SO COME ON.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.459
- NO.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.042
I DON'T WANNA GO.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.042
STOP PRESSURING ME.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.584
ALL YOU EVER DO IS

11:33.083 --> 11:35.584
THINK ABOUT YOURSELF.

11:35.626 --> 11:39.751
IF YOU CAME WITH ME,

11:35.626 --> 11:39.751
I THINK YOU'D BE

11:35.626 --> 11:39.751
REALLY SURPRISED

11:39.792 --> 11:41.083
HOW NOT TRUE THAT IS.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.042
COME ON. IF YOU WANNA ASK

11:43.000 --> 11:45.042
HORACE FOR PERMISSION,

11:45.083 --> 11:48.542
WE'LL GO ASK HIM.

11:45.083 --> 11:48.542
HE'S RIGHT THROUGH HERE.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.626
COME ON, IT'S JUST

11:52.083 --> 11:54.626
A FALSE ALARM.

11:54.667 --> 11:57.000
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.500
HEY, ANYBODY HERE

11:58.751 --> 12:01.500
WANNA LIMBO?

I'M NOT LEAVING,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.125
SO DROP IT.

12:37.167 --> 12:39.042
I KNOW, I KNOW.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.042
I'M SORRY.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.709
I WROTE YOU

12:41.083 --> 12:43.709
A VERY SINCERE APOLOGY NOTE.

12:43.751 --> 12:45.834
IT'S IN THIS DUFFEL BAG.

CLIMB IN AND READ IT?

WOW, YOU'LL DO ANYTHING

12:49.667 --> 12:52.083

12:52.125 --> 12:54.209
YOU'RE SO SELFISH.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.042
I KNOW.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.042
I KNOW I HAVE BEEN.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.042
THAT'S WHY

12:57.083 --> 12:59.042
I BOUGHT YOU THIS.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.959
SMELL IT,

12:59.083 --> 13:00.959

13:03.083 --> 13:07.918
IT'S PRONOUNCED ANASTASIA.

13:07.959 --> 13:10.959
YOU HAVE NOT

13:07.959 --> 13:10.959
BEEN ABSORBED.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.751
YOU MUST BE ABSORBED.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.834
YOU NOTICE ANYTHING

13:12.792 --> 13:14.834
DIFFERENT ABOUT HORACE?

13:16.083 --> 13:18.042
HAS HE ALWAYS HAD

13:16.083 --> 13:18.042
THAT LITTLE BEARD?

13:18.083 --> 13:21.125
YOU MUST SERVE

13:18.083 --> 13:21.125
REVENGEANCE.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.792
HE WILL BE YOUR MASTER.

13:22.834 --> 13:26.250
OH, NO, KAZ,

13:22.834 --> 13:26.250
YOU REMEMBER

13:22.834 --> 13:26.250
THE VILLAIN REVENGEANCE?

13:26.292 --> 13:28.125
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY

13:26.292 --> 13:28.125
THERE WAS A LOCKDOWN.

13:28.167 --> 13:30.626
REVENGEANCE IS TRYING TO

13:28.167 --> 13:30.626
SNEAK INTO MIGHTY MED.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.042
AND YOU LET HIM IN WHEN

13:30.667 --> 13:33.042
YOU OPENED THE VENT.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.042
AND NOW HE'S TAKING

13:33.083 --> 13:35.042
CONTROL OF HORACE.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.751
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.751
REVENGEANCE WAS DISEMBODIED.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.292
HE'S JUST

13:37.792 --> 13:39.292
A BLACK CLOUD NOW.

13:39.334 --> 13:42.000
I DON'T SEE ANY

13:39.334 --> 13:42.000
BLACK CLOUDS AROUND HERE.

13:44.167 --> 13:47.792
MAN, I CANNOT

13:44.167 --> 13:47.792
CATCH A BREAK TODAY.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.667
WHERE ARE KAZ AND OLIVER?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.334
EVERYONE ALREADY

13:54.709 --> 13:56.334
WANTS TO LEAVE.

13:56.375 --> 13:59.751
I CANNOT LET MY FIRST

13:56.375 --> 13:59.751
SURPRISE PARTY FAIL.

13:56.375 --> 13:59.751
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

13:59.792 --> 14:02.042
I'M SURE THEY'LL

13:59.792 --> 14:02.042
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

14:02.083 --> 14:05.042
BUT WE CAN STALL WITH

14:02.083 --> 14:05.042
PARTY GAMES.

14:05.083 --> 14:07.042
HOW ABOUT

14:05.083 --> 14:07.042
DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE?

14:07.083 --> 14:09.667
I HAVE TWO DUCKS

14:07.083 --> 14:09.667
IN MY BACKPACK,

14:07.083 --> 14:09.667
YOU GO GET A GOOSE.

14:09.709 --> 14:12.876
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

14:09.709 --> 14:12.876
THEY DON'T CARE

14:09.709 --> 14:12.876
ABOUT PARTY GAMES.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.042
THEY CARE ABOUT

14:12.918 --> 14:15.042
SELF-PRESERVATION.

14:15.083 --> 14:18.751
NOBODY LEAVES OR I WILL

14:15.083 --> 14:18.751
SNAP YOU LIKE A WISHBONE.

14:15.083 --> 14:18.751
NOW GO HIDE.

14:20.125 --> 14:23.959
YOU'VE GOT A REAL

14:20.125 --> 14:23.959
VIOLENT STREAK.

14:20.125 --> 14:23.959
I DIG IT.

14:25.709 --> 14:27.042
CLYDE, IMAGINE LIVING

14:25.709 --> 14:27.042
OUT IN THE OPEN,

14:27.083 --> 14:29.042
WHERE YOU NO LONGER

14:27.083 --> 14:29.042
HAVE TO CARRY

14:29.083 --> 14:31.375
THE BURDEN OF

14:29.083 --> 14:31.375
YOUR EVIL SECRET.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.042
YOU COULD GO TO

14:31.417 --> 14:33.042
ICE SHOWS,

14:33.083 --> 14:35.042
OR READ MAGAZINES

14:33.083 --> 14:35.042
ABOUT ICE SHOWS,

14:35.083 --> 14:37.250
OR ATTEND SEMINARS

14:35.083 --> 14:37.250
ABOUT THE EXCITING WORLD

14:37.292 --> 14:39.334
OF MANAGING ICE SHOWS.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.792
ED, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

14:41.834 --> 14:44.042
NOT EVERYONE SHARES

14:41.834 --> 14:44.042
YOUR LOVE OF ICE SHOWS.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.042
WELL, THEY SHOULD.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.042
THEY'RE MAJESTIC.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.125
CLYDE, I THINK WHAT ED

14:47.083 --> 14:49.125
IS TRYING TO SAY

14:49.167 --> 14:51.000
IS THAT IF YOU GIVE UP

14:49.167 --> 14:51.000
BEING A VILLAIN,

14:51.042 --> 14:52.667
YOU NEVER HAVE TO HIDE AGAIN,

14:52.709 --> 14:55.918
JUST LIKE ED HERE

14:52.709 --> 14:55.918
NO LONGER HAS TO HIDE.

14:55.959 --> 14:58.792
I NEED YOU ALL TO HIDE.

14:58.834 --> 15:02.042
NEVER. WHAT'S THE POINT OF

14:58.834 --> 15:02.042
BEING GOOD IF I HAVE TO HIDE

15:02.083 --> 15:04.959
IN THE CREVICES OF SOCIETY

15:02.083 --> 15:04.959
LIKE A COMMON SEWER RAT?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.709
NO OFFENSE, SEWER RAT.

15:07.751 --> 15:10.751
HIS NAME IS MONTY NOW,

15:07.751 --> 15:10.751
AND HE OWNS A MAILBOX STORE.

15:10.792 --> 15:14.042
ED, JUST CALM DOWN.

15:10.792 --> 15:14.042
YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS HERE.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.918
IF YOU WERE MY FRIENDS,

15:15.959 --> 15:18.042
YOU WOULD HAVE THROWN ME

15:15.959 --> 15:18.042
A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.125
THAT'S IT. I'M GOING BACK

15:18.083 --> 15:20.125
TO A LIFE OF EVIL.

15:20.167 --> 15:22.209
WE ALL SHOULD.

15:20.167 --> 15:22.209
I MEAN, TOGETHER,

15:22.250 --> 15:24.751
WE COULD EXTERMINATE

15:22.250 --> 15:24.751
EVERYONE ON THE PLANET.

15:24.792 --> 15:28.042
EXCEPT FOR HIM.

15:24.792 --> 15:28.042
I LIKE HIS CAPE.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.125
NOW WHO'S WITH ME?

15:29.167 --> 15:30.918
YEAH!

15:30.959 --> 15:33.042
GUYS, WAIT A MINUTE,

15:30.959 --> 15:33.042
GUYS.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.042
WHERE YOU GOING?

15:33.083 --> 15:35.042
THIS IS CATERED.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.792
WE'VE GOT FOOD HERE.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.792
COME ON, GUYS.

15:36.834 --> 15:40.959
PLEASE, GUYS, YOU CAN'T

15:36.834 --> 15:40.959
FALL OFF THE WAGON LIKE THAT.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.792
WOW, ED ALREADY PUSHED

15:41.000 --> 15:46.792
AN OLD LADY INTO THE STREET.

15:46.834 --> 15:49.751
- HE DIDN'T WASTE

15:46.834 --> 15:49.751
ANY TIME, DID HE?

15:46.834 --> 15:49.751
- NO, HE DID NOT.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.042
AS I MENTIONED,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.042
YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.792
EITHER OF YOU.

15:57.834 --> 16:03.042
IN HERE, WHOO-HOO!

15:57.834 --> 16:03.042
OUT THERE, BOO-HOO.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.334
THEY'RE NOT

16:13.375 --> 16:15.334
CHASING US.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.125
I THINK PRETENDING

16:15.375 --> 16:17.125
TO BE DRONES IS WORKING.

16:17.167 --> 16:19.375
I HAVE TO HAND IT TO

16:17.167 --> 16:19.375
THESE MINDLESS FREAKS.

16:19.417 --> 16:21.209
THEY HAVE AN EYE

16:19.417 --> 16:21.209
FOR DESIGN.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.459
THIS ROOM LOOKS

16:21.250 --> 16:22.459
MUCH MORE INVITING.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.876
OKAY.

16:24.918 --> 16:27.334
WE HAVE TO STOP

16:24.918 --> 16:27.334
REVENGEANCE BEFORE

16:24.918 --> 16:27.334
HE RISES AGAIN.

16:27.375 --> 16:30.417
OH, OKAY, I HAVE A PLAN.

16:27.375 --> 16:30.417
FOLLOW ME, OLIVER.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.042
HEY.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.918
WHAT'S UP?

16:36.959 --> 16:38.042
HOW'S IT DRONIN'?

16:40.209 --> 16:43.042
ALAN. YOU'RE SAFE.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.042
MAN, IT WAS REALLY

16:43.083 --> 16:45.042
SMART TO HIDE HERE.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.250
I'M NOT HIDING.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.250
THIS IS WHERE I NAP.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.542
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

16:50.083 --> 16:52.542
- REVENGEANCE HAS BROKEN

16:50.083 --> 16:52.542
INTO MIGHTY MED

16:52.584 --> 16:55.209
TO TURN ON THE HOSPITAL'S

16:52.584 --> 16:55.209
POSITRONIC REACTOR.

16:55.250 --> 16:58.042
HE'S GOING TO USE

16:55.250 --> 16:58.042
THE POWER FROM IT

16:55.250 --> 16:58.042
TO TURN HIMSELF HUMAN AGAIN.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.250
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

17:00.292 --> 17:02.083
THERE'S NO WAY TO

17:00.292 --> 17:02.083
ACCESS IT UNLESS

17:00.292 --> 17:02.083
THEY'VE GATHERED

17:02.125 --> 17:03.417
ALL NINE MIGHTY

17:02.125 --> 17:03.417
ADMINISTRATORS.

17:03.459 --> 17:05.917
THOSE NINE MIGHTY

17:03.459 --> 17:05.917
ADMINISTRATORS?

17:07.083 --> 17:09.459
YEAH. EACH OF THEM

17:07.083 --> 17:09.459
HAS BEEN IMPLANTED

17:09.500 --> 17:11.250
WITH ONE PART OF

17:09.500 --> 17:11.250
THE ACCESS CODE.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.375
BUT THEY'D HAVE TO BE IN

17:11.291 --> 17:13.375
A SPECIFIC FORMATION

17:13.416 --> 17:16.209
- THAT ONLY

17:13.416 --> 17:16.209
MY UNCLE HORACE KNOWS.

17:13.416 --> 17:16.209
- THAT SPECIFIC FORMATION?

17:20.334 --> 17:22.959
WE GOTTA STOP REVENGEANCE

17:20.334 --> 17:22.959
BEFORE HE RETURNS TO

17:23.000 --> 17:27.041
- HIS PHYSICAL FORM.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.041
- YOU MEAN THAT

17:23.000 --> 17:27.041
PHYSICAL FORM?

17:27.083 --> 17:29.042
WHAT DO WE DO?

17:27.083 --> 17:29.042
HOW DO YOU STOP A CLOUD?

17:29.083 --> 17:30.500
BY CREATING A VACUUM.

17:30.542 --> 17:32.417
IT'S SIMPLE METEOROLOGY.

17:32.459 --> 17:34.918
WE CAN USE THE HOSPITAL'S

17:32.459 --> 17:34.918
AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM

17:34.959 --> 17:36.042
TO CREATE A COLD FRONT,

17:36.083 --> 17:37.918
THEN TURN ON

17:36.083 --> 17:37.918
THE STERILIZING EQUIPMENT.

17:37.959 --> 17:39.959
THAT WILL FORM

17:37.959 --> 17:39.959
POCKETS OF WARM AIR,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.292
RESULTING IN

17:40.000 --> 17:41.292
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.

17:41.334 --> 17:43.500
OR WE COULD JUST USE

17:41.334 --> 17:43.500
THIS VACUUM, OLIVER.

17:43.542 --> 17:47.000
( mimicking)

17:43.542 --> 17:47.000
OR WE COULD JUST USE

17:43.542 --> 17:47.000
THIS VACUUM, OLIVER.

17:47.042 --> 17:49.000
WHAT ARE YOU

17:47.042 --> 17:49.000
MAD AT HIM FOR?

17:49.042 --> 17:50.959
I'M JUST IN

17:49.042 --> 17:50.959
A BAD PLACE RIGHT NOW.

17:56.667 --> 17:59.042
IT'S NOT WORKING.

17:56.667 --> 17:59.042
HE'S TOO POWERFUL.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.042
WE NEED MORE POWER.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.000
SERGE!

18:09.959 --> 18:12.000
WE GOT A FIGHTER.

18:26.125 --> 18:27.959
WE DID IT.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.167
I'VE NEVER BEEN

18:28.000 --> 18:31.167
PART OF A TEAM BEFORE.

18:31.209 --> 18:32.334
I DON'T LIKE IT.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.542
THERE COULD ONLY BE

18:34.667 --> 18:36.542
ONE REASON

18:36.584 --> 18:39.000
ALL NINE MIGHTY

18:36.584 --> 18:39.000
ADMINISTRATORS WOULD BE HERE.

18:39.042 --> 18:41.626
TO LIMBO!

18:41.667 --> 18:45.083
OH, THAT WAS

18:41.667 --> 18:45.083
EXHAUSTING.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.042
YOU KNOW WHAT

18:45.125 --> 18:47.042
I COULD GO FOR?

18:47.083 --> 18:50.626
A NICE 14-BLOCK WALK

18:47.083 --> 18:50.626
THROUGH A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD

18:50.667 --> 18:52.542
TO THE DOMAIN.

18:52.584 --> 18:55.042
STOP IT!

18:52.584 --> 18:55.042
I DON'T WANNA GO.

18:55.083 --> 18:58.042
WHY IS EVERYTHING ALWAYS

18:55.083 --> 18:58.042
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT?

18:58.083 --> 19:01.042
YOU KNOW, ALL THE TIME,

18:58.083 --> 19:01.042
I'M ALWAYS THINKING,

19:01.083 --> 19:02.626
WHAT CAN I DO FOR KAZ?

19:02.667 --> 19:04.459
WHAT CAN I DO

19:02.667 --> 19:04.459
TO CHEER HIM UP?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.584
HOW CAN I DISLODGE

19:04.500 --> 19:06.584
HIS HEAD FROM THAT BANNISTER?

19:08.083 --> 19:10.250
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME

19:08.083 --> 19:10.250
YOU DID ANYTHING FOR ME?

19:10.292 --> 19:13.417
ACTUALLY, PRETTY RECENTLY.

19:13.459 --> 19:16.083
REALLY?

19:13.459 --> 19:16.083
LIKE WHEN?

19:16.125 --> 19:18.375
WHEN I THREW YOU

19:16.125 --> 19:18.375
A BIRTHDAY PARTY

19:18.417 --> 19:20.709
AT THE DOMAIN

19:18.417 --> 19:20.709
TONIGHT,

19:20.751 --> 19:24.667
THREE MONTHS EARLY,

19:20.751 --> 19:24.667
TO SURPRISE YOU.

19:24.709 --> 19:27.626
AND NOW I WISH

19:24.709 --> 19:27.626
I NEVER HAD.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.667
YOU THREW ME

19:27.667 --> 19:29.667
A SURPRISE PARTY?

19:29.709 --> 19:32.292
SO THAT'S WHY YOU WERE

19:29.709 --> 19:32.292
BOSSING ME AROUND

19:32.334 --> 19:35.042
AND TRIED TO KNOCK ME

19:32.334 --> 19:35.042
UNCONSCIOUS WITH

19:32.334 --> 19:35.042
FAKE COLOGNE.

19:35.083 --> 19:38.042
BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT ME.

19:38.083 --> 19:41.000
AND I JUST

19:38.083 --> 19:41.000
YELLED AT YOU ALL DAY.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.083
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.083
WILL YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

19:45.125 --> 19:47.042
NOPE.

19:47.083 --> 19:50.250
BUT, KAZ, WE ONLY HAVE

19:47.083 --> 19:50.250
A FEW YEARS LEFT

19:50.292 --> 19:52.209
TO SPEND TOGETHER AND...

19:52.250 --> 19:55.626
ONE DAY, YOU'LL WAKE UP

19:52.250 --> 19:55.626
OLD AND ALONE.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.667
FINE. I FORGIVE YOU.

20:02.083 --> 20:04.083
WELL, THANKS FOR COMING.

20:04.125 --> 20:06.042
SORRY THE PIÑATA WAS

20:04.125 --> 20:06.042
FILLED WITH INTESTINES

20:06.083 --> 20:08.000
AND NOT CANDY.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.626
THIS PARTY

20:09.375 --> 20:11.626
WAS A DISASTER.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.542
I FEEL SO BETRAYED.

20:13.584 --> 20:16.417
AFTER EVERYTHING I DID

20:13.584 --> 20:16.417
GETTING ALL OUR DUCKS

20:13.584 --> 20:16.417
IN A ROW,

20:16.459 --> 20:18.542
AND THE DUCKS

20:16.459 --> 20:18.542
JUST LEAVE WITHOUT ME.

20:23.292 --> 20:25.209
WHEW! OH, MAN.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.792

20:25.250 --> 20:27.792
THAT LOCKSMITH WANTED $300

20:27.834 --> 20:29.542
JUST TO LET US BACK INTO

20:27.834 --> 20:29.542
OUR OWN STORE.

20:29.584 --> 20:31.709
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

20:29.584 --> 20:31.709
CAR WAX THAT COULD BUY?

20:31.751 --> 20:33.375
- A LOT.

20:31.751 --> 20:33.375
- YEAH.

20:33.417 --> 20:37.042
LOOK, WALLACE, I KNOW

20:33.417 --> 20:37.042
THE INTERVENTION DID NOT GO

20:37.083 --> 20:40.292
HOW YOU PLANNED, BUT IF

20:37.083 --> 20:40.292
TURNING NON-EVIL IS

20:37.083 --> 20:40.292
IMPORTANT TO YOU,

20:40.334 --> 20:41.667
I'M WILLING TO

20:40.334 --> 20:41.667
GIVE IT A TRY.

20:41.709 --> 20:44.834
THANKS. WE SHOULD

20:41.709 --> 20:44.834
DISCUSS THIS FURTHER

20:44.876 --> 20:47.334
OVER A NICE

20:44.876 --> 20:47.334
ANTI-HERO SANDWICH.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.751
PA-PA-PA-POW.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.667
THOSE KIDS ATE

20:52.667 --> 20:55.667
ALL OUR FOOD!

20:55.709 --> 20:57.500
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

20:55.709 --> 20:57.500
OUR DINNER TONIGHT.

20:57.542 --> 20:59.042
AND OUR LUNCH

20:57.542 --> 20:59.042
FOR TOMORROW,

20:59.083 --> 21:01.209
BECAUSE I SPENT

20:59.083 --> 21:01.209
ALL OUR MONEY ON CAR WAX.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.626
FROM THIS DAY FORTH,

21:01.250 --> 21:03.626
I PLEDGE TO BE

21:03.667 --> 21:05.834
EVEN MORE VILLAINOUS

21:03.667 --> 21:05.834
THAN EVER BEFORE.

21:05.876 --> 21:09.626
LET'S TEAR APART

21:05.876 --> 21:09.626
THE NEXT CUSTOMER WHO

21:05.876 --> 21:09.626
WALKS THROUGH THAT DOOR.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.667
IN THIS SHOP,

21:09.667 --> 21:12.667
THAT COULD BE DAYS.

21:14.792 --> 21:18.209
EVERYONE LEFT.

21:14.792 --> 21:18.209
IT'S JUST CLYDE AND WALLACE.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.751
IT'S JUST AS WELL.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.751
I'M SO TIRED,

21:18.250 --> 21:21.751
I'M ALMOST DEAD.

21:23.459 --> 21:26.125
I REALLY WANTED TO

21:23.459 --> 21:26.125
TEAR SOMEONE APART TODAY.

21:26.167 --> 21:29.584
LET'S DESTROY THESE

21:26.167 --> 21:29.584
SUPERHERO FIGURINES,

21:29.626 --> 21:31.334
ESPECIALLY HIM.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.167
