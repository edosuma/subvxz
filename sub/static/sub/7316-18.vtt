00:04.043 --> 00:06.000
[pop music blaring]

00:19.000 --> 00:21.434
[phone ringing]

00:28.782 --> 00:29.913
Hello?

00:29.956 --> 00:31.000
[man speaking indistinctly
over phone]

00:31.043 --> 00:32.260
Yeah, I got
everything we needed.

00:32.304 --> 00:33.826
I'll know what I have
for you soon enough.

00:33.869 --> 00:35.391
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:35.434 --> 00:37.478
That's exactly what the guy
at the hardware store asked,

00:37.521 --> 00:39.565
and you're both chauvinist pigs.

00:39.608 --> 00:42.217
I guarantee I'm better
with power tools than any man.

00:46.043 --> 00:47.913
[man speaking over phone]Gross.

00:47.956 --> 00:49.826
That's not what I meant,

00:49.869 --> 00:52.260
although it does
prove my pig thesis.

00:52.304 --> 00:55.913
MAN: Chill out.
You're just oversensitive.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.826
We can discuss the finer
points of sexism later.

00:58.869 --> 01:00.347
[man speaks indistinctly]Yeah, that's what she said.

01:00.391 --> 01:01.652
[phone beeps off]

01:01.695 --> 01:05.260
[clattering,
woman screaming]

01:35.913 --> 01:38.086
So, Larsen, you check your
Leave and Earnings Statement?

01:38.130 --> 01:40.521
Last Monday.
Still no payday.

01:40.565 --> 01:41.826
And you talked
to Chuck in payroll?

01:41.869 --> 01:43.347
I mean, usually
he's civil if you are.

01:43.391 --> 01:45.304
I was very civil.

01:45.347 --> 01:48.043
I explained I'm trying to put a
deposit down on a new apartment,

01:48.086 --> 01:50.434
but he just grumbled
something about next week.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.043
Well, Chuck has spoken--
I wouldn't push it.

01:53.086 --> 01:56.130
Ugh. I have to be out of
temp housing by Friday.

01:56.173 --> 01:59.130
Oh, what if I show him
a little shoulder?

01:59.173 --> 02:00.695
Never worked for me.

02:00.739 --> 02:02.782
Oh.I tell you
what, though--

02:02.826 --> 02:05.043
I have a couch and an extra key.

02:05.086 --> 02:08.739
Thanks, Tim.
That's really sweet.

02:08.782 --> 02:10.608
Rent won't be cheap, though.Oh.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.086
More than
a little shoulder, huh?

02:25.521 --> 02:27.130
What?Nothing.

02:27.173 --> 02:29.304
Work.Flirt.

02:29.347 --> 02:31.434
BOTH: Work flirt.You two

02:31.478 --> 02:33.043
should never be left alone,
you know that?

02:33.086 --> 02:34.695
Look, I was just
being friendly.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.608
Agent Larsen is nice.Seen a lot

02:36.652 --> 02:37.782
of "nice" this week.Mm-hmm.

02:37.826 --> 02:40.782
And she always lingers.

02:40.826 --> 02:43.347
She lingers for you, Tim.

02:43.391 --> 02:45.347
Tina was transferred to the
Carolinas nine years ago,

02:45.391 --> 02:47.521
and now she's back.
I'm a familiar face,

02:47.565 --> 02:49.000
if that's what you mean.It wasn't.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.869
And your face isn't all
that's familiar.

02:51.913 --> 02:53.782
Hey, that was one date,
and it was 108 months ago.

02:53.826 --> 02:55.304
108?Must have gone well.

02:55.347 --> 02:57.565
Yes. I mean... no.

02:57.608 --> 02:58.695
It doesn't matter, because

02:58.739 --> 03:00.913
I'm still with Delilah.
End of story.

03:00.956 --> 03:03.000
Well, she works in Dubai

03:03.043 --> 03:05.043
and it's been six months

03:05.086 --> 03:06.956
since you've seen her.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.478
Thank you for picking
at the scab on my heart, guys.

03:10.521 --> 03:13.043
Well, Bishop had the problem.

03:13.086 --> 03:14.565
I never said that.

03:14.608 --> 03:18.652
By all means, stretch
your legs, Tim.

03:18.695 --> 03:19.869
Yeah.

03:19.913 --> 03:22.782
Keep the monotony
out of monogamy.

03:22.826 --> 03:24.260
TONY:
By cheating?

03:24.304 --> 03:26.956
No. Just words.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.347
Elaborate.Harmless

03:28.391 --> 03:29.913
practice for later use

03:29.956 --> 03:31.695
on your actual flirt.

03:31.739 --> 03:33.956
Practice
makes perfect.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.956
Look, what
I'm saying is...

03:36.000 --> 03:37.739
Keep the tools sharp.See?

03:37.782 --> 03:39.478
Gibbs knows what
I'm talking about.

03:39.521 --> 03:41.739
Ah, I got no idea. Got a body
in off-base housing.

03:43.130 --> 03:44.260
Look sharp.

03:44.304 --> 03:45.565
Tools.

03:48.086 --> 03:50.043
Open sesame.

03:50.086 --> 03:51.695
[helicopter hovering,
indistinct radio communication]

03:51.739 --> 03:54.391
Actually, the original
French text would be

03:54.434 --> 03:57.000
sÃ©same, ouvre-toi.

04:01.347 --> 04:02.521
[chuckles]

04:03.913 --> 04:05.478
Oh.

04:05.521 --> 04:07.565
Mon Dieu.

04:11.086 --> 04:13.565
Neighbor saw
the blood trail

04:13.608 --> 04:15.304
on the driveway,
called the police,

04:15.347 --> 04:17.652
mentioned that the house
belongs to a Marine.

04:17.695 --> 04:18.782
Registered to
Gunnery Sergeant

04:18.826 --> 04:20.739
Holt Perkins, currently deployed

04:20.782 --> 04:23.521
as part of a training team
working with the Iraqi Army.

04:23.565 --> 04:24.826
Get an I.D. on the body?

04:24.869 --> 04:25.913
TONY:
No, LEOs didn't find any.

04:25.956 --> 04:27.043
The house is clear--
no signs

04:27.086 --> 04:29.391
of blood or struggle
outside of the garage.

04:29.434 --> 04:31.608
Well, she certainly bled out.

04:31.652 --> 04:33.869
Following a trip
to the hardware store.

04:33.913 --> 04:35.652
Drill bits.

04:35.695 --> 04:37.739
Late night hankering
for woodwork?

04:37.782 --> 04:38.608
Yeah, well, it happens.

04:38.652 --> 04:39.826
Bishop.

04:39.869 --> 04:41.565
According to his CO,
Gunnery Sergeant

04:41.608 --> 04:44.086
Perkins will be home
sooner than later.

04:44.130 --> 04:45.130
He's on leave.

04:45.173 --> 04:46.434
Transport just landed
two hours ago.

04:46.478 --> 04:48.391
McGEE: It's a hell of a thing
to come home to.

04:48.434 --> 04:51.043
Yeah.PERKINS: This is my house.
Get off me.

04:51.086 --> 04:53.000
Get your hands off me!
Where's my wife?

04:53.043 --> 04:55.173
Get o...
Don't touch me again.Gibbs, NCIS.

04:55.217 --> 04:57.782
Get that out of my face.
Where's my wife?Marine...

04:57.826 --> 04:59.826
I need you to focus.

05:14.217 --> 05:16.652
Oh, God.

05:18.782 --> 05:21.000
Oh, God, thank you, thank you.

05:22.086 --> 05:23.521
Thank you.

05:25.565 --> 05:27.000
Gunny...

05:28.478 --> 05:29.608
It's not her.

05:31.043 --> 05:32.130
That's not my wife, sir.

05:33.478 --> 05:35.521
I've never seen
this woman before.

05:50.782 --> 05:53.043
Lee? Leandra?GIBBS: We already
cleared the house.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.782
Your wife's not here.Then where is she?

05:54.826 --> 05:57.173
There's a dead woman
in my garage and no sign of her.

05:58.391 --> 06:01.086
Straight to voicemail.Any idea

06:01.130 --> 06:03.043
where your wife might be?Why do you think
I keep calling her?

06:03.086 --> 06:05.304
Can't you see
something's not right?

06:07.347 --> 06:10.173
I'm sorry, sir, I just...

06:10.217 --> 06:12.043
I told her my leave
was scheduled for next week.

06:12.086 --> 06:14.000
I wanted to surprise her.

06:14.043 --> 06:16.782
We haven't spoken since
my unit lost the Internet.

06:22.391 --> 06:24.086
Wait...

06:26.086 --> 06:28.260
Gunny?Someone's been in here.

06:30.565 --> 06:32.086
Someone's been in here.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.782
Explain that.My wife--

06:33.826 --> 06:36.869
she's a clean freak.
Like, OCD in a major way.

06:36.913 --> 06:40.000
Who happens to be a vegan
who hates that couch.

06:40.043 --> 06:41.130
How long you been deployed?No, no. No.

06:41.173 --> 06:43.217
This is not
some personality swing.

06:43.260 --> 06:44.869
She's a personal trainer.

06:44.913 --> 06:46.130
Self-discipline's
her life.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.000
Her body's
a temple, get it?

06:48.043 --> 06:51.217
I mean, I had to convert the-the
guest room into a gym.

06:54.173 --> 06:56.086
This the room?

06:56.130 --> 06:57.695
Yeah.

06:57.739 --> 06:59.217
Where's the elliptical?

06:59.260 --> 07:02.217
And the Bowflex?

07:02.260 --> 07:04.086
Find what's missing, Gunny.

07:04.130 --> 07:07.260
Drill bits weren't
for woodworking.

07:07.304 --> 07:09.260
You own a safe?

07:09.304 --> 07:10.347
Yeah.

07:10.391 --> 07:12.434
Bolted to the
closet floor-- why?

07:18.130 --> 07:21.043
She was trying
to crack it.

07:21.086 --> 07:23.043
Well, after breaking off
two drill bits,

07:23.086 --> 07:24.869
looks like a trip
to the hardware store

07:24.913 --> 07:26.086
would be in order.

07:26.130 --> 07:28.434
Our victim
was a thief.Yup.

07:28.478 --> 07:31.173
Meet Mallory Bleeker.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.043
Her prints were in AFIS.
She was arrested four years ago

07:34.086 --> 07:36.043
for unlawful entry
and burglary.

07:36.086 --> 07:38.695
She was sentenced to two
years and served ten months.

07:38.739 --> 07:41.086
Experienced thief wouldn't
move bulky exercise equipment

07:41.130 --> 07:43.000
or stay around
to crack a safe.

07:43.043 --> 07:45.391
Unless she knew she had time.

07:45.434 --> 07:47.000
How?The same way that

07:47.043 --> 07:48.956
I know you spent the weekend
trying to sync

07:49.000 --> 07:51.217
the Beatles' Abbey Road
with Jaws.

07:51.260 --> 07:53.043
Let me tell you something:
"Octopus's Garden"

07:53.086 --> 07:54.956
starts at the exact same time
that the Kintner boy

07:55.000 --> 07:56.869
jumps into the water
with the shark.

07:56.913 --> 07:59.695
I'm telling you,
it's uncanny.Mm. Exactly what you said

07:59.739 --> 08:02.043
in your
EveryoneIEverMet.com status.

08:02.086 --> 08:03.695
And according to

08:03.739 --> 08:06.608
Leandra Perkins'
latest status update,

08:06.652 --> 08:08.478
she is "Maxin'

08:08.521 --> 08:10.260
and relaxin' at the pool."

08:10.304 --> 08:12.260
Yup, with a geotag

08:12.304 --> 08:15.260
at Virginia Soul Health Spa.

08:15.304 --> 08:17.913
I interrupted her fire cupping
session when I called.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.260
She's been posting updates like
this for the last four days.

08:20.304 --> 08:22.869
McGEE: She's telling the
whole world she's not home.

08:22.913 --> 08:24.521
Previous posts also mention
that her husband is deployed,

08:24.565 --> 08:27.043
which garnered a lot
of support and well-wishes.

08:27.086 --> 08:29.260
And meant that the
house was empty.

08:29.304 --> 08:33.304
The truck, the food,
the pillow on the couch--

08:33.347 --> 08:36.260
our thief was living in the
house while she was robbing it.

08:36.304 --> 08:38.173
That's creepy.Either of you have a good

08:38.217 --> 08:40.347
locksmith or moat guy?

08:40.391 --> 08:42.000
And where's Mrs. Perkins now?

08:42.043 --> 08:43.913
Virginia state police
are escorting her home.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.956
She was pretty upset.

08:50.478 --> 08:53.130
DUCKY:
The World Wide Web.

08:53.173 --> 08:56.043
It astonishes me how people

08:56.086 --> 08:59.000
post their privates--
well, private information--

08:59.043 --> 09:01.000
for all to see.

09:01.043 --> 09:04.130
Such individuals would never
leave a note on the front door:

09:04.173 --> 09:06.000
"The house is empty."

09:06.043 --> 09:09.043
So why treat
their computers differently?

09:09.086 --> 09:11.173
I mean, such lapses in judgment

09:11.217 --> 09:13.043
must be a gift to
your profession.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.130
Hashtag "blessed."

09:15.173 --> 09:17.000
Still spending your nights
on the Internet, Duck?

09:17.043 --> 09:18.391
Social media, Jethro,

09:18.434 --> 09:21.956
is a cesspool of questionable
human behavior.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.043
Just like your day job.Well, the questionable act
in this case

09:25.086 --> 09:27.043
are multiple stab wounds
with a blunt knife.

09:27.086 --> 09:29.086
Blunt?Yeah, the-the knife

09:29.130 --> 09:31.956
tore the skin rather
than sliced it.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.434
Dull blade's
just as dangerous.

09:33.478 --> 09:35.260
For the user as well.

09:35.304 --> 09:37.043
I mean, a blunt knife
is not efficient,

09:37.086 --> 09:40.043
and it's an odd choice
for a murder weapon.

09:40.086 --> 09:41.956
Murder wasn't the plan.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.043
Apparently, it became the plan.
The wounds are deep.

09:44.086 --> 09:46.260
Some of them more
than four inches.

09:46.304 --> 09:48.173
Adrenaline rush.

09:48.217 --> 09:53.000
Oh, and I found this when
I removed her clothes,

09:53.043 --> 09:55.173
stuffed in her brassiere.

09:55.217 --> 09:57.391
Blood?

09:57.434 --> 09:59.826
Possibly the victim's.

09:59.869 --> 10:02.304
If so, it would suggest
it was put there postmortem.

10:04.130 --> 10:07.000
Killer with a cause?Killer with a logo.

10:08.217 --> 10:10.173
Questionable
human behavior

10:10.217 --> 10:12.173
that requires further study?

10:12.217 --> 10:14.173
Damn right.

10:16.521 --> 10:18.695
MAN:
I thought I came in
as next of kin.

10:18.739 --> 10:21.739
You did.Then why are we
in a room with no windows?

10:24.782 --> 10:27.434
[sighs]

10:27.478 --> 10:29.391
That's my sister... Mallory.

10:29.434 --> 10:31.652
I knew that life
would catch up to her.

10:31.695 --> 10:34.260
In addition to being
her big brother,

10:34.304 --> 10:35.782
you're listed as a known
accomplice, Scott.

10:35.826 --> 10:38.869
That was a long time ago.

10:38.913 --> 10:40.130
Nice watch.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.217
I got out of that life, man.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.260
What do you do now?

10:45.304 --> 10:47.217
Paper?

10:47.260 --> 10:49.913
I bet that sounded
better in your head.As a wholesaler.

10:49.956 --> 10:52.260
Look, the fact that I got
out of crime is the reason

10:52.304 --> 10:54.130
why I haven't talked
to my sister in over a year.

10:54.173 --> 10:56.043
I can't be around that anymore.

10:56.086 --> 10:59.000
Ooh. Limited Edition T-Money's.

10:59.043 --> 11:01.130
They only made 500 pair
of those puppies.
Yeah.

11:01.173 --> 11:03.565
eBay, dawg.So, what did those
run you, 1,200 bucks?

11:03.608 --> 11:05.217
15. I saved up.

11:05.260 --> 11:07.260
Did you save receipts?What do you want?

11:07.304 --> 11:11.086
I want to know
who is Mallory's fence.

11:11.130 --> 11:13.043
Forget it.

11:13.086 --> 11:15.173
I talk, and my shoes
will be on eBay

11:15.217 --> 11:16.347
with my feet still in them.

11:16.391 --> 11:18.000
Exactly.

11:18.043 --> 11:19.347
So, Mallory have any enemies?

11:19.391 --> 11:22.478
All right, look,
I was at the Drake Motel

11:22.521 --> 11:25.391
off State Route 40
with a prostitute named Daisy.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.304
She works
the Monroe-Saticoy district.

11:28.347 --> 11:29.956
You'll know it's her

11:30.000 --> 11:31.869
by the Daisy Duck tattoo
covering her...

11:31.913 --> 11:33.565
chest... area.

11:33.608 --> 11:34.608
Daisy-- yeah, got it.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.956
Thanks for the tip.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.304
Look, she'll verify,
I was with her all night.

11:41.304 --> 11:43.043
Found this on her body.

11:44.956 --> 11:48.043
Do you want to catch who
murdered your little sister?

11:48.086 --> 11:49.304
Because this is them.

11:49.347 --> 11:51.173
[sighs]

11:51.217 --> 11:53.260
Look, whatever Mallory
was caught up in,

11:53.304 --> 11:56.173
she didn't deserve this,
but I've never seen this symbol.

11:56.217 --> 11:58.521
[knocking on door]

11:58.565 --> 12:00.347
Boss?

12:03.130 --> 12:05.086
Make it fast, McGee.I was watching
in Observation.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.956
While our suspect doesn't know
what that symbol is...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.695
Faster....I think I do. I know
what that symbol means.

12:09.739 --> 12:11.391
I just need
to make a quick phone call.

12:14.304 --> 12:17.260
[phone ringing]

12:17.304 --> 12:19.434
Yeah.

12:19.478 --> 12:21.086
Hey, it's me.DELILAH:
Tim.

12:21.130 --> 12:22.260
Hi. Oh, I thought

12:22.304 --> 12:24.260
tomorrow was our
Super-Sexy-Skype night.

12:24.304 --> 12:26.260
Oh, it, uh, definitely is, but

12:26.304 --> 12:28.217
this is about work-- I actually
just sent you something?

12:28.260 --> 12:30.347
Okay.

12:30.391 --> 12:32.391
Now, I remember you saying
something last month

12:32.434 --> 12:34.043
about your task force
in Dubai tracking--

12:34.086 --> 12:36.130
Uh, we're tracking
a terror group

12:36.173 --> 12:38.217
called "Dragon's Tooth," yeah.

12:38.260 --> 12:41.130
Okay, the e-mail I just sent
you-- is that their logo?

12:45.434 --> 12:47.217
Not publicly.
How did you get this?

12:47.260 --> 12:49.260
Uh, a murder.
It was found on the body.

12:49.304 --> 12:51.304
Military?McGEE:
The house was.

12:51.347 --> 12:54.043
The victim was a thief in
the middle of robbing the place.

12:54.086 --> 12:56.652
Hey, Tim, you still have
that extra key to your place?

12:56.695 --> 12:59.434
I think I just pushed it
with Chuck.
[whispering]:
I'm on the phone. I can't talk.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.260
[whispers]:
Oh. I'll come back.

13:01.304 --> 13:03.739
Okay. Yes.

13:04.956 --> 13:07.173
Hey, still there?

13:07.217 --> 13:09.478
NCIS needs to coordinate
with us right now.

13:09.521 --> 13:11.391
Well, we've been following up
on the robbery angle.

13:11.434 --> 13:13.217
This wasn't
about a robbery, Tim.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.173
This is an act
of domestic terrorism.

13:15.217 --> 13:16.608
MTAC in ten?

13:16.652 --> 13:17.913
We can do five.

13:17.956 --> 13:19.043
Even better.

13:19.086 --> 13:20.043
I just have one more question
for you.

13:20.086 --> 13:22.086
Yeah.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.913
Why does she need
that extra key?

13:33.782 --> 13:36.043
Our task force
in Dubai has been tracking

13:36.086 --> 13:38.565
the social media activity of
terror groups for the last year.

13:38.608 --> 13:40.434
VANCE: And Dragon's Tooth
is one of them?

13:40.478 --> 13:42.086
Yes, Director.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.695
What do they want?DELILAH:
Stir the pot.

13:43.739 --> 13:46.043
Level the playing field
against the United States.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.391
The bully. The Dragon.

13:47.434 --> 13:49.956
It's our tooth in that logo.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.043
That's why it's pulled
from the root and bloody.

13:52.086 --> 13:53.478
It's a trophy.

13:53.521 --> 13:55.913
Special Agent Rafi Ali,
Homeland Security.

13:55.956 --> 13:57.086
I'm the task force
team leader.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.565
You mind if I step in?

13:58.608 --> 14:01.043
Oh, go for it, Raff.The idea is

14:01.086 --> 14:04.043
to pull the dragon's teeth--
our teeth-- one-by-one.GIBBS: How?

14:04.086 --> 14:06.260
According to your case report,
a thief used social media

14:06.304 --> 14:08.043
to find her target.

14:08.086 --> 14:10.478
Dragon's Tooth does the same,
but for terror.

14:10.521 --> 14:14.173
How?I think Agent Gibbs
wants specifics.

14:14.217 --> 14:15.652
I've worked with him before.

14:15.695 --> 14:17.043
Say someone posts online

14:17.086 --> 14:19.043
that a family member
is deployed--

14:19.086 --> 14:21.695
a brother, sister,
father, husband.

14:21.739 --> 14:23.434
And suddenly, they
become the target.

14:23.478 --> 14:27.043
Anti-military tweets,
threatening posts, phone calls.

14:27.086 --> 14:30.130
Anything to harass or
incite fear at home.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.304
It's the first
we're hearing about it.

14:32.347 --> 14:33.956
Because we've been
tracking the activity

14:34.000 --> 14:36.043
and shutting down the bogus
accounts before it escalates.

14:36.086 --> 14:37.521
It just did, to murder.

14:37.565 --> 14:40.173
Your thief and
our cyber terrorist

14:40.217 --> 14:42.260
hit the same house
on the same night,

14:42.304 --> 14:43.913
both thinking it was empty.

14:43.956 --> 14:45.173
Terrorist-- as in singular?

14:45.217 --> 14:47.565
Do you know who this guy is?

14:47.608 --> 14:49.956
The group is run by
a man named Omer Malik,

14:50.000 --> 14:51.913
a British national
operating online.

14:51.956 --> 14:55.086
Actually, "group" may be
a misnomer. It's just him.

14:55.130 --> 14:57.608
So he's here in the U.S.?And upping his game.

14:57.652 --> 14:59.043
He's never shown up
in person before.

14:59.086 --> 15:00.565
Guess we missed that.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.086
You missed that?

15:02.130 --> 15:04.086
VANCE:
That's it?

15:04.130 --> 15:07.826
Probably. You need to keep us
updated going forward.

15:07.869 --> 15:09.217
And you do the same.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.043
Sure.

15:11.086 --> 15:12.956
We'll talk in your a.m.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.826
Delilah, I'll call you in
a few minutes so that we can...

15:15.869 --> 15:17.043
VANCE: My feelings
aren't easily hurt,

15:17.086 --> 15:19.826
but I don't think
he knew who I was.

15:19.869 --> 15:22.869
Or maybe he did, and that's why
he left in such a hurry.

15:22.913 --> 15:24.826
GIBBS:
Find out.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.000
I told you
to scrub your profile.

15:31.043 --> 15:32.956
FBI sends weekly reminders
to service members.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.782
I use it for work.
It's how I get and keep clients.

15:35.826 --> 15:38.043
Well, clearly, more than clients
are following you online.

15:38.086 --> 15:39.608
Ya think?!

15:39.652 --> 15:42.565
As we already mentioned twice,
that is why you are here.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.347
And neither of you got hurt,
so, let's focus on the positive

15:45.391 --> 15:47.478
and get back
to your friend list.

15:47.521 --> 15:49.565
Anyone you don't recognize?

15:49.608 --> 15:51.608
Any names that stick out?

15:51.652 --> 15:54.000
Is he on here?
Oh, don't.

15:54.043 --> 15:56.782
Is there a name we should check?Don't listen to him.
It's nothing.

15:56.826 --> 15:58.304
Saying it's nothing
makes it worse.

15:58.347 --> 16:00.043
It was a couples
health spa.

16:00.086 --> 16:02.130
Long weekend at
a couples health spa.

16:02.173 --> 16:03.565
He's my best client.

16:03.608 --> 16:05.043
Oh. Body's a temple.

16:05.086 --> 16:07.000
Looks like the
congregation's growing.

16:07.043 --> 16:09.000
It was platonic, okay?Let's see.

16:09.043 --> 16:10.434
Pace, Park...

16:10.478 --> 16:13.000
I see you're still
friends with James.

16:13.043 --> 16:14.434
There's a Henry Pecan.

16:14.478 --> 16:16.608
No "Platonic," so,
I guess that's a lie, too.

16:16.652 --> 16:19.086
Platonic is not his name!You see?

16:19.130 --> 16:21.913
You know what? Let's
do this separately.Bish, no. Sparks make fire.

16:21.956 --> 16:24.956
Who's Henry Pecan? Is that one
of your survivalist cousins?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.782
It's the water boy from
your college volleyball team.

16:26.826 --> 16:28.173
The eunuch.

16:28.217 --> 16:30.347
That's mean.
And, no, it's not.

16:30.391 --> 16:32.434
Then I have no idea.

16:32.478 --> 16:34.391
Me, neither.

16:37.086 --> 16:39.130
Okay.

16:39.173 --> 16:40.739
Sparks make fire.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.086
So, who is Henry Pecan?

16:53.434 --> 16:55.652
GIBBS:
Go, McGee.

16:55.695 --> 16:57.826
Well, Delilah hasn't
texted me all night,

16:57.869 --> 16:59.956
so, now, it's the middle
of the night in Dubai.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.652
It's a workday here.Which is why
I kept digging.

17:01.695 --> 17:03.869
Turns out, Omer Malik is
a distant relative

17:03.913 --> 17:06.608
of Bashir Malik, who is
an accomplice in the bombing...

17:06.652 --> 17:08.217
Paralyzed Delilah?

17:09.391 --> 17:11.521
Is this personal?

17:11.565 --> 17:13.521
You know, cousins
with no known connection,

17:13.565 --> 17:15.739
but it's not listed
on Homeland's BOLO.

17:15.782 --> 17:17.608
Why would Rafi leave that out?

17:17.652 --> 17:20.217
Why would Delilah?I don't know.

17:20.260 --> 17:22.086
[phone ringing]

17:24.173 --> 17:27.000
Keep digging.

17:28.304 --> 17:30.608
Delilah been texting you?

17:30.652 --> 17:32.304
I think she's avoiding me.

17:32.347 --> 17:33.695
I'm not sure why.

17:33.739 --> 17:35.608
She texted me,
and I messaged back,

17:35.652 --> 17:37.043
but she stopped replying.

17:37.086 --> 17:38.869
About the case?

17:38.913 --> 17:40.565
No. Special Agent Larsen.

17:40.608 --> 17:42.521
Don't worry. Cleared that up.

17:43.869 --> 17:45.260
Wait. What?!

17:45.304 --> 17:46.826
What do you got, Abbs?

17:46.869 --> 17:48.304
A prediction, Gibbs.

17:48.347 --> 17:50.086
In approximately
66 seconds,

17:50.130 --> 17:52.391
you're gonna run out of this
room with a break in the case.

17:52.434 --> 17:53.826
I hope so.
Okay, so,

17:53.869 --> 17:55.130
per our subpoena,

17:55.173 --> 17:57.826
the good folks
at EveryoneIEverMet.com

17:57.869 --> 18:00.043
turned over all of Henry
Pecan's account information.

18:00.086 --> 18:01.565
Dragon's Tooth cover?

18:01.608 --> 18:03.347
He never wrote
on Mrs. Perkins' page,

18:03.391 --> 18:05.347
but, according
to private messages,

18:05.391 --> 18:07.217
which are also covered
by the subpoena,

18:07.260 --> 18:09.695
Henry Pecan is... Malik.

18:11.695 --> 18:13.173
Messages are all
to the same person.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.000
Yeah, E. Pistachio.

18:16.521 --> 18:19.347
Pecan and Pistachio?

18:19.391 --> 18:22.695
Nuts. Clearly embracing the fact
that these are online aliases.

18:22.739 --> 18:24.434
And aliases that have
been talking for a while,

18:24.478 --> 18:26.565
in code, and usually
about political ideology.

18:26.608 --> 18:28.782
I'm still standing here, Abbs.

18:28.826 --> 18:30.652
Okay, so, the most
recent message says

18:30.695 --> 18:32.956
that Malik and Pistachio
are meeting today

18:33.000 --> 18:35.130
at Malik's apartment
in Alexandria.

18:35.173 --> 18:38.086
You buried the lead,
did ya?
Yeah, I kind of rigged
my prediction.

18:38.130 --> 18:41.000
The meeting's in less
than an hour, Gibbs.

18:43.826 --> 18:46.521
Apartment 2A should be the
first left beyond this door.

18:46.565 --> 18:48.739
Rented to
a "Voight Hex."

18:48.782 --> 18:49.869
What's a Voight Hex?

18:49.913 --> 18:51.086
Name you give a third child.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.173
We know the meeting agenda?

18:52.217 --> 18:53.304
No.

18:53.347 --> 18:54.391
So trap is on the table.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.652
Yup.
Knock first?

18:55.695 --> 18:57.043
I vote sending in Bishop

18:57.086 --> 18:58.521
selling Girl Scout cookies
in a dress.

18:58.565 --> 19:01.043
I can make that work.

19:05.826 --> 19:08.000
Uh... fourth floor?

19:08.043 --> 19:09.391
Hungry, boss?

19:09.434 --> 19:11.869
Pay the man.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.086
Don't move.

19:19.434 --> 19:21.304
[gunfire on video game]

19:21.347 --> 19:22.826
[knocking on door]

19:22.869 --> 19:25.478
What? Who is it?

19:25.521 --> 19:27.086
BISHOP:
Pizza.

19:27.130 --> 19:28.869
I didn't order a pizza.

19:33.869 --> 19:36.478
I didn't order a pizza.

19:36.521 --> 19:38.043
Says "Apartment 2A."

19:38.086 --> 19:39.565
Cool!

19:39.608 --> 19:40.913
[grunts]

19:40.956 --> 19:42.347
Federal agents!

19:42.391 --> 19:43.652
NCIS!

19:43.695 --> 19:45.608
Federal agents!
Come on, get up! Get up!

19:45.652 --> 19:47.043
[groaning]
My nose!

19:47.086 --> 19:49.304
Ah! What's happening?

19:49.347 --> 19:51.826
The game wasn't
turned up that loud!

19:51.869 --> 19:53.608
What's going on?!Hands behind you...

19:53.652 --> 19:55.000
Clear.
Clear!

19:55.043 --> 19:56.478
No sign of Malik or Pistachio.

19:56.521 --> 19:57.521
Maybe this guy's
a nut, too.

19:57.565 --> 19:59.000
Hey, you know this
man, Omer Malik?

19:59.043 --> 20:00.695
That's...my roommate.

20:00.739 --> 20:02.695
You working with him?No, he rents a room.

20:02.739 --> 20:05.608
He found me
on Craigslist.That was your first mistake.

20:05.652 --> 20:08.608
He's a wanted terrorist
and murderer.
Hey, I don't
know anything about that.

20:08.652 --> 20:10.652
Look, I always play
as the good guys!

20:11.956 --> 20:14.434
All right, soldier, prove it.
Where's Malik?
[sniffles]

20:14.478 --> 20:17.478
Well, he's supposed to
be here, 'cause he said
he's meeting someone.

20:17.521 --> 20:19.869
Meeting hasn't
happened yet?
Uh...
Get him out of here.

20:19.913 --> 20:21.652
What?Let's go.

20:21.695 --> 20:23.565
What are you doing?

20:23.608 --> 20:25.260
Where are we going?

20:26.739 --> 20:28.826
Well, it's been 20 minutes.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.739
The targets get spooked?

20:35.478 --> 20:37.782
[footsteps approach]

20:37.826 --> 20:40.434
[knocking on door]

20:45.739 --> 20:48.826
[all shouting]

20:48.869 --> 20:49.782
Put it down!

20:49.826 --> 20:51.521
Down!Now!

20:51.565 --> 20:54.652
[sighs]

20:57.173 --> 20:59.434
Well, this is awkward.

21:11.086 --> 21:13.478
So, wait, what are
you telling me?

21:13.521 --> 21:15.043
You are E. Pistachio?

21:15.086 --> 21:17.000
It's a deep cover alias
I've been working under.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.913
To make Omer Malik think
he was recruiting

21:18.956 --> 21:20.652
a disgruntled DoD employee
in a wheelchair.

21:20.695 --> 21:21.913
It worked.

21:21.956 --> 21:22.913
Last night, you were in Dubai.

21:22.956 --> 21:24.695
I've been in the States a week.

21:24.739 --> 21:27.043
Wait, wait, wait. So...

21:27.086 --> 21:28.782
when we were in MTAC...

21:28.826 --> 21:31.347
Tim, it has been horrible

21:31.391 --> 21:33.043
not being able
to tell you.A week?

21:33.086 --> 21:34.000
Where have you been staying?

21:34.043 --> 21:35.304
RAFI:
It was need to know,

21:35.347 --> 21:36.565
Special Agents.

21:36.608 --> 21:38.130
It's "Director."

21:38.173 --> 21:40.043
Leon Vance.

21:40.086 --> 21:42.260
Of course. Sorry, sir.

21:42.304 --> 21:44.173
But this appeared to be
an imminent threat

21:44.217 --> 21:46.043
to the homeland.

21:46.086 --> 21:48.086
Our sting's been
in the making for weeks.

21:48.130 --> 21:50.173
We did it in a day.You piggybacked off

21:50.217 --> 21:51.652
our undercover operative
messaging Malik.

21:51.695 --> 21:54.521
And now, because you didn't
inform us, he's in the wind.

21:54.565 --> 21:55.652
Guess we needed to know.

21:55.695 --> 21:57.956
I was protecting my op
and my operative.

22:00.608 --> 22:02.130
And your credit.

22:04.739 --> 22:05.869
BISHOP:
Searched the apartment.

22:05.913 --> 22:07.000
Nothing to track Malik.

22:07.043 --> 22:08.869
No phone, no computer.

22:08.913 --> 22:10.217
Just his home movie
collection.

22:10.260 --> 22:12.043
I'll need to see those.

22:12.086 --> 22:13.869
In the spirit of cooperation.

22:20.043 --> 22:22.304
Can you believe that guy?

22:22.347 --> 22:23.217
[chuckles]
I know.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.956
Who shoots on miniDV anymore?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.782
No, Agent Ali.

22:27.826 --> 22:29.000
I don't trust him.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.434
With Delilah?

22:30.478 --> 22:32.173
With the case.

22:32.217 --> 22:35.000
And, frankly, that, too.

22:35.043 --> 22:36.826
I mean, they work together.
I guess it's possible

22:36.869 --> 22:38.260
they're just friendly.

22:38.304 --> 22:40.173
Totally.But?

22:40.217 --> 22:41.086
You want me to speculate?

22:41.130 --> 22:43.130
No.

22:43.173 --> 22:45.565
I mean, just 'cause the birds
and bees are in the same room

22:45.608 --> 22:49.826
doesn't necessarily mean
that there's... pollination.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.608
[chuckles]
Did you pass health class?

22:52.652 --> 22:54.173
It's like Agent Larsen and me.

22:54.217 --> 22:55.913
I mean, there's-there's nothing
between us, you know?

22:55.956 --> 22:57.695
Yeah.

22:57.739 --> 23:00.913
Just a few billion years
of basic sexual impulse.

23:00.956 --> 23:02.043
Yep.

23:02.086 --> 23:03.739
Wait, no.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.000
No, I'm saying
the opposite of that.

23:05.043 --> 23:06.043
Here we go.

23:06.086 --> 23:07.260
Tim, they left info

23:07.304 --> 23:09.782
off a BOLO and kept
us in the dark

23:09.826 --> 23:12.086
because she was undercover.
Now, that's questionable tactics

23:12.130 --> 23:14.043
but not proof
of pollination.

23:14.086 --> 23:16.173
Delilah never called
or texted me back.

23:16.217 --> 23:17.869
She still hasn't.

23:17.913 --> 23:19.130
You just talked to her.

23:19.173 --> 23:20.956
We were interrupted.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.043
Tim, how many times have you
tried to contact Delilah

23:23.086 --> 23:24.217
in the last 12 hours?

23:24.260 --> 23:26.130
Texts? A couple.

23:27.086 --> 23:29.565
All right, a dozen.

23:29.608 --> 23:31.304
But I only called six times.

23:31.347 --> 23:33.608
What?!And left messages.

23:33.652 --> 23:35.391
Oh, honey.

23:35.434 --> 23:38.130
I know.I know you know,
but you're scaring her.

23:38.173 --> 23:39.521
That's not good.

23:39.565 --> 23:42.086
Women want the illusion
of being chased.

23:42.130 --> 23:44.043
They don't want to
actually be chased.

23:44.086 --> 23:46.565
[phone rings]Hold on a second. DiNozzo.

23:46.608 --> 23:48.347
[man speaks indistinctly
over phone]Oh.

23:48.391 --> 23:50.000
You don't say.

23:50.043 --> 23:51.043
I'll let the director know.

23:51.086 --> 23:53.043
Rafi just signed in downstairs.

23:53.086 --> 23:54.130
Delilah with him?

23:54.173 --> 23:56.826
Breathing room, Tim.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.826
[inhales]Breathe with me.

23:58.869 --> 24:00.043
Much like our...

24:00.086 --> 24:01.695
mystery videotapes,

24:01.739 --> 24:04.130
secrets will soon be revealed.

24:04.173 --> 24:07.043
Secrets can be sexy.

24:18.043 --> 24:21.130
Malik has broken
into multiple houses.

24:21.173 --> 24:23.173
We didn't know.
Honestly, this time.

24:24.956 --> 24:26.043
How many?

24:26.086 --> 24:28.086
Six tapes, six houses.

24:28.130 --> 24:30.043
The dates written on them
suggest that he's been

24:30.086 --> 24:31.130
doing this for months.

24:31.173 --> 24:33.043
GIBBS: Unnoticed.McGEE: Yep.

24:33.086 --> 24:34.391
He does just enough
to make people wonder

24:34.434 --> 24:36.086
if someone's been inside
the house

24:36.130 --> 24:38.043
but not enough
to report it.

24:38.086 --> 24:39.826
He's making a point.

24:41.217 --> 24:42.869
That we're vulnerable.

24:42.913 --> 24:45.739
It's like what the Manson Family
did in the '60s.

24:45.782 --> 24:48.739
Break into empty houses
and film it

24:48.782 --> 24:52.086
just for the terror aspect.

24:52.130 --> 24:53.826
Creepy crawls.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.217
Except instead of
the Hollywood Hills,

24:55.260 --> 24:57.217
it's all military houses.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.913
Latest one is
from the Perkinses.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.043
Second tape, please.

25:01.086 --> 25:03.130
TECH:
Yes, sir.

25:03.173 --> 25:05.043
Malik's never bragged
about this online.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.086
Never mentioned it.

25:09.130 --> 25:10.695
He hasn't released these.Yeah, well,

25:10.739 --> 25:11.913
he's stockpiling.

25:11.956 --> 25:13.173
Easier to get away
with a crime

25:13.217 --> 25:14.782
when no one knows
you're doing it.

25:14.826 --> 25:17.173
Then why leave his mark
after killing the woman?

25:18.478 --> 25:19.782
Grand finale.

25:19.826 --> 25:22.826
McGEE:
If Malik digitizes these tapes

25:22.869 --> 25:25.434
and releases them, we're
gonna be dealing with...

25:25.478 --> 25:27.043
media frenzy,
public panic.

25:27.086 --> 25:28.347
People will think
we're under attack.

25:28.391 --> 25:29.478
We are.

25:40.173 --> 25:41.478
Who's holding the camera?

25:47.869 --> 25:50.173
Malik has an accomplice.

25:50.217 --> 25:53.521
We need to scan every minute
of this footage for an I.D..Yes, we do.

25:53.565 --> 25:55.869
Director Vance,
Homeland is part of this.

25:55.913 --> 25:57.869
[half-heartedly]:
Gibbs. Stop. Don't.

25:59.956 --> 26:01.260
Damn, he's so fast.

26:01.304 --> 26:03.000
I'll report to my superiors

26:03.043 --> 26:06.000
that our work is done here.We've already spoken.

26:13.434 --> 26:17.782
Just so you know, Delilah
made sure we had separate rooms.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.782
We're sharing a place
while she's back in the States.

26:21.826 --> 26:25.043
I could tell you were concerned.

26:27.956 --> 26:32.304
[computer chiming]

26:32.347 --> 26:36.000
More decoded transcripts
and Delilah's chats with Malik.

26:36.043 --> 26:37.913
Ugh, your computer
won't shut up.

26:37.956 --> 26:40.217
Oh, yeah, I set it to alert me
on breaking news stories

26:40.260 --> 26:42.086
involving social media
and terrorism.

26:42.130 --> 26:45.086
You might want
to narrow those parameters.Three Colorado teens

26:45.130 --> 26:47.043
recruited to go to Syria
last year.

26:47.086 --> 26:48.565
Three British
girls last month.

26:48.608 --> 26:51.043
Three guys from New York
and Florida a couple weeks ago.

26:51.086 --> 26:52.260
Yeah, I know.

26:52.304 --> 26:53.956
"There are soldiers
around the world

26:54.000 --> 26:55.956
who do not know
they are soldiers."

26:56.000 --> 26:57.173
"The weapons
in this war

26:57.217 --> 26:58.434
"are available to everyone.

26:58.478 --> 27:00.086
"Social media.

27:00.130 --> 27:03.173
All they have to do
is pick them up."

27:03.217 --> 27:06.000
Malik said that?Nope. That was Delilah
responding to him.

27:06.043 --> 27:07.000
She was smart.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.434
Played him
like a fiddle.

27:08.478 --> 27:10.347
She made him think
that she was paralyzed

27:10.391 --> 27:12.304
by the fight on terror.

27:12.347 --> 27:14.391
She was.Yeah, but she leans into it.

27:14.434 --> 27:16.000
She wasn't
afraid to use

27:16.043 --> 27:18.173
personal details
while undercover.

27:18.217 --> 27:22.173
You know, embarrassing truths
about her wheelchair, her job,

27:22.217 --> 27:24.043
even her long-distance
relationship.

27:24.086 --> 27:26.217
Mmm. I haven't gotten that far.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.521
She's kind of a badass.That much I know.

27:27.565 --> 27:29.130
Which leaves
one question...

27:29.173 --> 27:32.043
Wait, so what page
is the personal stuff on?

27:32.086 --> 27:33.739
Should I delete
my social media profile?

27:33.782 --> 27:36.260
No.
The more the bad guys use it,

27:36.304 --> 27:38.130
the more we learn about them.

27:38.173 --> 27:40.956
I'm gonna delete it.Bishop,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.434
so what's next? Cars? Guns?

27:42.478 --> 27:45.652
They're both weapons.
You gonna give them up, too?

27:45.695 --> 27:48.478
What? Th-There's a 14-day

27:48.521 --> 27:51.086
waiting period
before I can delete my account?Oh, yeah.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.130
Cooling-off time.Yet they allow

27:52.173 --> 27:53.652
recruitment videos
and beheadings

27:53.695 --> 27:55.652
to upload immediately.

27:55.695 --> 27:58.086
Hm.

28:03.565 --> 28:08.043
Ugh. The goose bumps this is
giving me are, like, painful.

28:08.086 --> 28:11.000
Are you watching this, McGee?Yeah.

28:11.043 --> 28:12.608
You okay?

28:12.652 --> 28:14.260
Honestly, I haven't had time
to figure that out.

28:14.304 --> 28:16.652
It's been one thing
after another.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.217
Delilah?[scoffs]
We haven't even had the chance

28:19.260 --> 28:21.391
to say a proper hello
to each other.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.173
No! Not the dog!

28:23.217 --> 28:26.130
No! Not... Put
the knife down!Abby, it's okay.

28:26.173 --> 28:28.000
He doesn't hurt the dog.
I've already seen this part.

28:28.043 --> 28:29.086
Oh.

28:29.130 --> 28:31.130
Spoiler alert.

28:31.173 --> 28:33.130
You want him to hurt the dog?

28:33.173 --> 28:35.130
No. I just wanted to, you know,
feel my own sense

28:35.173 --> 28:37.000
of relief, organically.Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:37.043 --> 28:39.217
Stop it. Stop it.
Rewind.

28:41.391 --> 28:43.565
Look.

28:43.608 --> 28:45.565
Look at that. Right there.
He touches the banister.

28:45.608 --> 28:47.565
Fingerprints.Most people don't clean
their balustrades

28:47.608 --> 28:49.000
on a regular basis.

28:49.043 --> 28:51.652
Ugh. They don't?

28:51.695 --> 28:53.000
Ew.

28:57.434 --> 28:59.565
TONY: Have a good reason
why your prints were

28:59.608 --> 29:02.565
in the Perkins house?Pizza delivery.

29:02.608 --> 29:05.739
No one was home.Except you and Malik.

29:05.782 --> 29:09.391
Malik, the guy whose
apartment you were headed to.

29:09.434 --> 29:12.739
Yeah, you saw us.
You tipped him off.

29:12.782 --> 29:15.565
So who was the pizza
for, Papa John?

29:15.608 --> 29:18.565
You want me to say it was
for Malik, but it was for me.

29:18.608 --> 29:20.043
I'm allowed one free
a month.

29:20.086 --> 29:21.391
You don't even live
in the building.

29:21.434 --> 29:23.043
So?

29:23.086 --> 29:25.000
So where were you gonna eat it?

29:30.217 --> 29:33.521
You have a collect call from
the Maryland State Penitentiary.

29:33.565 --> 29:35.478
Terrorism and murder.Do you accept the charges?

29:35.521 --> 29:38.478
He found me online.
I justrun the camera.

29:38.521 --> 29:41.608
It was dangerous, but it paid
well and nobody ever got hurt.

29:41.652 --> 29:43.739
Until they did.The house was supposed
to be empty.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.000
Malik panicked.

29:45.043 --> 29:46.260
He went around
to the garage.

29:46.304 --> 29:48.000
He killed her.

29:48.043 --> 29:50.826
I was hiding inside.
I had nothing to do with it.

29:50.869 --> 29:53.000
Looking the other way counts!

29:53.043 --> 29:54.347
Where is he now?

29:54.391 --> 29:57.347
He would never tell me
where he was going.

29:57.391 --> 29:59.347
I made some Twitter comments
he liked.

29:59.391 --> 30:01.260
I'm not some believer.

30:01.304 --> 30:03.434
Look, I know
who is, though.

30:03.478 --> 30:07.000
Th-There was this chick
Malik was trying to recruit.

30:07.043 --> 30:09.043
Uh, Pistachio--
it's a fake name.

30:09.086 --> 30:11.043
But he talked about
her all the time.

30:11.086 --> 30:13.173
A disgruntled
DoD employee.

30:13.217 --> 30:16.086
Uh, blames the government for
paralyzing her or something.

30:16.130 --> 30:18.086
She wants revenge.And if we already
know that much?

30:18.130 --> 30:19.304
I don't have a name.

30:19.347 --> 30:22.782
But you can look her up.

30:22.826 --> 30:25.826
I'm giving you an inside threat.

30:25.869 --> 30:28.043
She promised Malik intel.

30:28.086 --> 30:30.521
She is his
perfect weapon.

30:30.565 --> 30:33.391
He's, like, obsessed with her.

30:35.173 --> 30:37.304
[sighs]
No.

30:41.260 --> 30:42.347
McGee...

30:42.391 --> 30:44.260
Boss, I understand
that Delilah's our key

30:44.304 --> 30:45.869
to drawing out Malik--
I get that.

30:45.913 --> 30:48.434
But before we talk
about using her as bait...

30:48.478 --> 30:51.739
Bring her here.I'm waiting for her
to call me back.

30:51.782 --> 30:53.782
[phone ringing]

30:56.000 --> 30:57.260
It's her.

30:57.304 --> 30:59.086
I need to talk
to her first.

30:59.130 --> 31:00.608
Just me.

31:00.652 --> 31:03.043
Work it out, Tim.

31:05.043 --> 31:06.347
[knocking on door]

31:10.173 --> 31:11.391
Hey.

31:12.695 --> 31:15.652
Come on in.

31:21.173 --> 31:23.565
So, this is where
they put you up, huh?

31:23.608 --> 31:24.869
Both of you?

31:31.173 --> 31:33.652
Well, it's a nice place.

31:33.695 --> 31:35.608
It's big.

31:35.652 --> 31:36.956
I've only been here a week.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.217
Could have stayed with me.

31:39.260 --> 31:41.478
That would have defeated
the whole need-to-know thing.

31:41.521 --> 31:43.217
Which was a jerk move
by your boss.

31:43.260 --> 31:44.739
I don't talk
about Gibbs like that.

31:44.782 --> 31:48.434
I don't share a
bathroom with Gibbs.

31:48.478 --> 31:50.304
Are you not telling
me something?

31:50.347 --> 31:51.565
What? You think
I'm still lying to you?

31:51.608 --> 31:53.173
I don't know what to think.

31:53.217 --> 31:54.391
Look, I don't
know what to think

31:54.434 --> 31:55.739
because we haven't talked.

31:55.782 --> 31:57.739
So you have said,
in multiple texts.

31:57.782 --> 31:59.739
Yeah, none of which
you've replied to.

31:59.782 --> 32:01.043
Well, here we are
now, talking.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.869
Because I've been pestering you.

32:02.913 --> 32:04.652
And I've managed
to look past that,

32:04.695 --> 32:07.043
which I think
is pretty gracious on my part.

32:07.086 --> 32:08.956
You should have come
to me with this case.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.695
Have you never had
to take orders you didn't like?

32:10.739 --> 32:11.695
I am right now.

32:11.739 --> 32:13.347
Gibbs sent me to get you.

32:13.391 --> 32:15.086
You're our best bet
to finding Malik.

32:15.130 --> 32:16.695
So what's the difference?!

32:16.739 --> 32:19.782
At least I told you.Only because
I just asked you, Tim!

32:19.826 --> 32:21.565
It's exactly my point!

32:21.608 --> 32:24.869
What are we even
talking about?!

32:24.913 --> 32:27.434
Do you want to break up?
No.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.913
Well, me, neither.

32:29.956 --> 32:32.043
But are we?

32:32.086 --> 32:34.173
[sighs heavily]

32:34.217 --> 32:36.043
It sure sounds like it, yeah.

32:36.086 --> 32:37.260
[knocking on door]

32:38.478 --> 32:39.913
It's perfect. Rafi's home.

32:39.956 --> 32:42.565
Do not blame him!Don't defend him.

32:47.260 --> 32:49.695
I heard shouting.

33:00.043 --> 33:01.304
Hey. Tim around?

33:01.347 --> 33:02.695
Hmm. Hey.

33:02.739 --> 33:05.565
Uh, he stepped out.
Oh.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.478
I would have offered you
my place to stay,

33:07.521 --> 33:09.608
but I'm in a very committed
relationship.

33:13.391 --> 33:14.695
In case
you don't remember, I'm...

33:14.739 --> 33:16.869
Have a good night, Tony.

33:16.913 --> 33:19.130
She remembers.

33:19.173 --> 33:21.521
Where are we with Homeland?

33:21.565 --> 33:23.608
Ah, Agent Ali is on his way up.

33:23.652 --> 33:25.391
He's not a happy camper.

33:25.434 --> 33:26.826
I'd say his...

33:26.869 --> 33:28.565
...willingness
to let us use Delilah

33:28.608 --> 33:30.478
for another undercover op

33:30.521 --> 33:31.565
matches Tim's now.It's gonna be

33:31.608 --> 33:33.173
up to her.
Where is McGee?

33:33.217 --> 33:35.086
Haven't heard from him.

33:35.130 --> 33:36.217
Well, he's had his time.

33:36.260 --> 33:37.521
Uh, you want me to call?

33:37.565 --> 33:39.000
No.

33:39.043 --> 33:42.217
Hi. You've reached
Special Agent Timothy McGee.

33:42.260 --> 33:43.956
Leave a message after the beep.

33:50.565 --> 33:52.304
And you said Rafi
was the only one

33:52.347 --> 33:53.478
that knew about
this place...?

33:53.521 --> 33:55.913
Not the time, Tim.I agree.

33:55.956 --> 33:57.565
Although, it's worth noting,

33:57.608 --> 34:00.000
when I was told
that NCIS was involved,

34:00.043 --> 34:02.130
things worked out nicely.

34:02.173 --> 34:03.478
You followed me here?

34:03.521 --> 34:04.869
Since we're interested

34:04.913 --> 34:07.130
in the same person,
lover boy.

34:09.478 --> 34:11.130
You told him about me?I was undercover.

34:11.173 --> 34:13.478
The closer I can be
to the truth, the better.

34:13.521 --> 34:15.869
Which is why I'm here--
the truth.

34:15.913 --> 34:17.913
It's quite simple.

34:17.956 --> 34:20.956
Are you undercover for me?

34:21.000 --> 34:24.391
Or them?

34:24.434 --> 34:27.391
It determines how many bodies
will be found tonight.

34:29.782 --> 34:33.652
In either case,
it's a grim outcome for you.

34:37.956 --> 34:39.782
[elevator bell dings,
both laughing]

34:39.826 --> 34:42.043
Well, I appreciate
the insight, Agent...?

34:42.086 --> 34:45.043
Call me "Raff."Boundaries, Larsen.

34:45.086 --> 34:46.869
We'll take him from here.
All right, back on the elevator.

34:46.913 --> 34:50.391
What the hell?
You called me up here.Bigger fish to fry elsewhere.

34:50.434 --> 34:53.304
Still going straight
to voicemail.
Delilah's
safe house where is it?

34:53.347 --> 34:55.304
Need to know.Last we heard,
McGee was headed there,

34:55.347 --> 34:56.608
and now he's not answering.And that means...?

34:56.652 --> 34:59.434
Still slow on the uptake,
Raff-- let's go!

34:59.478 --> 35:00.869
Don't make this a
measuring contest.

35:00.913 --> 35:02.521
Move!

35:02.565 --> 35:03.739
We're bigger.

35:11.782 --> 35:13.739
[quietly]: Tell him
you're with him.
What? No.

35:13.782 --> 35:15.782
Just tell him
you're with him.
No.

35:15.826 --> 35:18.086
One last video before
I release them online.

35:18.130 --> 35:20.173
Ready?

35:20.217 --> 35:22.130
Look, she started out

35:22.173 --> 35:24.000
as a double agent for
Homeland Security.

35:24.043 --> 35:26.391
Some point during the
last year, I figured out

35:26.434 --> 35:28.347
that she wasn't on
my side anymore.

35:28.391 --> 35:30.913
[laughs] You know I want
to believe that.

35:30.956 --> 35:32.086
Believe it.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.391
McGEE: At first,
I thought it was me.

35:34.434 --> 35:37.260
I came here tonight to
try and change her mind.

35:37.304 --> 35:38.956
It didn't work.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.652
He came here tonight
to tell me I was wrong.

35:40.695 --> 35:42.304
And it is a little bit
about you.

35:42.347 --> 35:44.826
And Rafi.
Stop blaming him.

35:44.869 --> 35:46.434
Stop defending him!What, do you think
I'm seeing him?!

35:46.478 --> 35:48.391
I don't know. Are you?

35:48.434 --> 35:50.739
Is that why
you're a traitor?

35:50.782 --> 35:54.217
Can't be a traitor to someone
who doesn't care about you.

35:54.260 --> 35:56.173
What are you talking about?
I'm here. I care.

35:56.217 --> 35:57.391
Obviously,
not enough to listen.

35:57.434 --> 35:58.521
I'm still listening,

35:58.565 --> 35:59.826
but I haven't
heard an answer!

35:59.869 --> 36:02.260
No, no, no! Please!Just tell him the truth!

36:02.304 --> 36:04.739
The truth is, I still care about
you, Tim! Can't you see that?

36:04.782 --> 36:06.739
None of this was easy.

36:06.782 --> 36:09.043
What are we even doing?

36:09.086 --> 36:11.000
We haven't even had
a proper "Hello."

36:12.347 --> 36:14.043
Why'd you move halfway
around the world?

36:14.086 --> 36:15.478
Why did you let me?

36:15.521 --> 36:17.521
Because I love you.

36:17.565 --> 36:20.347
I know.

36:20.391 --> 36:21.608
Are you with me?!

36:21.652 --> 36:23.391
Yes, I am with you.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.304
But you don't have to shoot him.

36:33.217 --> 36:36.521
No... I don't.

36:39.173 --> 36:41.434
[McGee grunts]

36:41.478 --> 36:42.826
[gasping]

36:42.869 --> 36:45.086
[groaning]

36:46.956 --> 36:48.347
[whimpering]

36:54.347 --> 36:56.956
[gasping]

36:57.000 --> 36:58.478
But you do.

36:59.913 --> 37:02.304
I-I said I'm with you.

37:02.347 --> 37:04.521
Prove it.

37:08.043 --> 37:10.000
Prove it!

37:14.304 --> 37:16.826
Metro PD's on alert.
They might be closer.

37:16.869 --> 37:19.304
No, the condo's just up here.

37:19.347 --> 37:21.478
Next right, Gibbs.

37:34.826 --> 37:37.782
It's a test.

37:37.826 --> 37:39.260
We'll make it.

37:39.304 --> 37:40.304
Just pass the test.

37:40.347 --> 37:43.347
Tim, what are you...?

37:43.391 --> 37:46.521
Delilah, pull the trigger.

37:49.086 --> 37:52.000
[sighs]

38:03.086 --> 38:04.434
What are you doing?

38:04.478 --> 38:06.826
I can't.
The gun's not loaded.
He wouldn't give you

38:06.869 --> 38:08.956
a loaded weapon!How was I supposed
to know that?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.217
Well, I used
the word "test."
Enough!

38:11.260 --> 38:12.869
I thought you understood
that was the plan!That wasn't my plan!

38:12.913 --> 38:15.000
Well, what was your plan?Shut up!

38:15.043 --> 38:16.739
This was my plan![yelling]

38:22.347 --> 38:23.347
Don't!

38:26.565 --> 38:27.434
McGee.

38:27.478 --> 38:29.565
We're okay, boss.

38:29.608 --> 38:33.043
Wow. Who gave you that head
wound-- Delilah or Malik?

38:33.086 --> 38:35.086
Just gets these ties off me.

38:35.130 --> 38:36.347
TONY:
They're off.

38:37.695 --> 38:39.173
And the knife?

38:39.217 --> 38:40.173
[sighs with relief]

38:40.217 --> 38:42.869
Rule number nine-- I listen.

38:42.913 --> 38:44.869
You and I, on the other hand--

38:44.913 --> 38:46.565
we need to work on
our communication.

38:55.695 --> 38:57.347
Hello.

38:59.347 --> 39:01.521
Hi.

39:07.130 --> 39:09.217
Bishop?Hmm?

39:09.260 --> 39:12.956
When you said work-flirts
keep your kung fu strong,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.043
what-what do you
mean by that?

39:15.086 --> 39:18.000
BISHOP:
It's just a theory, really.

39:18.043 --> 39:19.304
Well, that theory
of everything worked

39:19.347 --> 39:21.565
for McGot-Lucky last night.Mm-hmm.

39:21.608 --> 39:23.130
I know kung fu.

39:23.173 --> 39:24.826
Yes, you do, and you have...

39:24.869 --> 39:26.521
you have learned well,
Grasshopper.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.130
[laughter]

39:28.173 --> 39:31.130
Wow. That must have
sounded bad.

39:31.173 --> 39:33.391
Yeah, just a little,
but Tony cleared it up.

39:33.434 --> 39:36.478
You two... work-flirts?

39:36.521 --> 39:40.391
No. Agent Larsen was just asking
for the inside scoop on Rafi.

39:40.434 --> 39:41.956
âª Hunk.
Yeah.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.826
I've been thinking about you.

39:43.869 --> 39:46.913
You're either real complicated,
or super simple, Tina.

39:50.434 --> 39:52.478
Good-bye, Tony.

39:55.565 --> 39:58.130
Good morning.
Morning.

39:58.173 --> 40:01.869
By the way, we, uh,
heard about Agent Ali.

40:01.913 --> 40:03.391
Suspended for gross negligence.

40:03.434 --> 40:05.000
Yup, stop smiling.

40:08.565 --> 40:10.130
What?

40:10.173 --> 40:13.565
They just made me team leader.

40:14.391 --> 40:16.652
You're kidding.Wow.

40:16.695 --> 40:19.086
That's boss, boss.

40:19.130 --> 40:20.347
Yeah, well, social
media's not going away,

40:20.391 --> 40:23.304
so neither is this
kind of threat, so,

40:23.347 --> 40:24.695
our work is more
important than ever.

40:24.739 --> 40:26.478
TONY:
Well, congratulations.

40:26.521 --> 40:28.608
So, you heading back to Dubai?

40:28.652 --> 40:32.000
Well, it's going
to be more work

40:32.043 --> 40:34.434
and more responsibilities,

40:34.478 --> 40:37.130
but, uh, since the
threat's at home now...

40:39.565 --> 40:42.130
...my team will be, too.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.434
You mean, you're going
to be here in DC?

40:44.478 --> 40:47.000
It's a higher
security clearance,

40:47.043 --> 40:50.000
and that means
even more secrets.

40:50.043 --> 40:53.652
Huh.
Well, secrets can be sexy.

40:57.173 --> 40:58.521
Ah, geez. Get a room.

41:00.217 --> 41:02.217
I already have one.
