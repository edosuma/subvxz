WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:06.420
We're almost done with this area.

00:06.420 --> 00:08.200
We missed two platoons or so.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.200
Watch for them.

00:09.470 --> 00:10.740
Roger.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.850
Message from Naotsugu.

00:12.850 --> 00:15.140
The enemy might be approaching.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.990
I'll report once I have visual.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.200
Tohya!

00:18.200 --> 00:20.000
Lure them out! Got it!

00:20.320 --> 00:24.880
But how far can Miss Minori 
see in this darkness?

00:24.880 --> 00:28.250
She's using magic eye drops 
that Naotsugu lent her.

00:28.710 --> 00:32.010
She should be able to see 
like a cat for a full day.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.110
<i>So far, it's all gone according to plan.</i>

00:35.110 --> 00:36.510
<i>It has to go well.</i>

00:37.220 --> 00:40.320
<i>I forced everyone into agreeing with me.</i>

00:41.100 --> 00:42.710
A night attack?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.150
What are you talking about?

00:44.150 --> 00:46.420
You said you were just getting 
them to evacuate!

00:46.420 --> 00:48.620
Those kids can't protect the city alone...

00:48.620 --> 00:51.690
No, they didn't say they could.

00:51.690 --> 00:53.650
That's why they're attacking.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.600
What?

00:54.600 --> 00:56.930
The goblins aren't protecting anything.

00:56.930 --> 00:59.910
If we worry about protecting 
something, we can't beat them.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.640
So we attack them.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.630
That's the plan.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.960
But...

01:03.960 --> 01:06.740
And when they're attacked, they'll get spooked.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.010
They aren't well-trained, 
so that'll slow them down.

01:11.010 --> 01:15.430
And their attacks will be more sporadic 
and more easily defended.

01:16.350 --> 01:19.930
Honestly, it isn't a bad strategy.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.990
Yeah, that's it.

01:22.990 --> 01:25.190
We'll be with them. Don't worry.

01:31.030 --> 01:33.050
It's going to be a long night.

01:33.050 --> 01:33.960
Yeah.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.320
But we aren't alone, are we?

01:36.790 --> 01:39.070
As long as they have something 
to protect, anyone would...

01:40.800 --> 01:44.580
Marie tells me they're going 
to be defending Choushu.

01:45.050 --> 01:48.030
Naotsugu and his group are 
preparing a surprise attack.

01:48.030 --> 01:51.840
What? We haven't even finished 
discussing things here.

01:52.210 --> 01:54.470
If you were actually there, seeing it,

01:54.470 --> 01:56.840
you naturally wouldn't want to just ignore it.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.600
The three of us hold all power over decisions in 
this matter, which includes sending troops.

02:03.030 --> 02:07.400
We must quickly come to a consensus 
before the next full conference.

03:39.660 --> 03:40.950
A plot?

03:40.950 --> 03:45.240
You're saying the goblin attack 
is an adventurer plot?

03:45.580 --> 03:51.000
If the adventurers had acted to weaken them 
from the start, this wouldn't have happened.

03:51.230 --> 03:55.150
Though I think calling it a plot 
is a rather drastic leap...

03:55.150 --> 03:56.750
Baron Krendit,

03:57.050 --> 04:00.030
right now, it's important that no 
one withhold their thoughts.

04:00.030 --> 04:05.050
Isn't that why we've held this 
conference without them?

04:06.280 --> 04:10.020
To be honest, I don't expect 
Choushu to last for long.

04:10.490 --> 04:14.250
Most likely, their next target will be 
Tsukuba, Lord Kiliva's territory.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.900
Or possibly...

04:17.970 --> 04:20.150
Maihama?

04:20.190 --> 04:26.160
<b>A Lazy, Cowardly Princess</b>

04:21.840 --> 04:23.920
A Lazy, Cowardly Princess.

04:26.370 --> 04:27.700
What?

04:27.700 --> 04:30.060
Are they still having their little secret meeting?

04:30.060 --> 04:34.170
It's probably about something they 
really don't want us to hear.

04:34.490 --> 04:36.460
They haven't settled on a course of action,

04:36.460 --> 04:38.430
and they have to consider their pride.

04:38.430 --> 04:41.170
They'd prefer not to owe 
the adventurers anything.

04:41.390 --> 04:44.750
The first group they're likely to turn to is...

04:44.750 --> 04:48.530
Yes, the guardians they've held in 
high esteem since ancient times...

04:48.530 --> 04:50.050
The Izumo Knights.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.460
But...

04:51.960 --> 04:53.180
Then, as we thought...

04:53.920 --> 04:57.050
Yes, none of us has any idea why,

04:57.050 --> 05:00.070
but the Knights of Izumo are gone.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.680
Our recon teams report

05:04.680 --> 05:09.080
that several of the fortresses 
they once used are empty.

05:09.330 --> 05:14.080
And they found no corpses or signs of combat.

05:14.340 --> 05:16.590
It's as if they've been spirited away.

05:16.590 --> 05:20.090
But in any case, the fact is that they're gone.

05:22.330 --> 05:27.090
Th-Then our only hope is for all the lords 
to unite and attack the goblins...

05:27.090 --> 05:28.350
Strategically speaking,

05:28.350 --> 05:32.120
surrounding them is the most feasible plan.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.250
We force them to lay siege to 
a well-defended stronghold city,

05:35.250 --> 05:40.110
and when they're tired, we surround them 
with a large, combined army, and attack.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.440
Oh, my...

05:41.440 --> 05:47.040
That sounds like you're telling us 
to sacrifice one of the cities.

05:47.770 --> 05:48.620
You aren't...

05:49.010 --> 05:53.930
going to tell me to sacrifice Tsukuba since 
it's the one they're likely to target, are you?

05:53.930 --> 05:56.370
No, no one's saying that.

05:56.370 --> 05:57.700
Of course not!

05:57.700 --> 06:00.130
I won't let Tsukuba be sacrificed!

06:01.360 --> 06:03.630
Calm down, Lord Kiliva.

06:04.150 --> 06:06.130
Let's take a break.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.140
They're approaching!

06:15.140 --> 06:16.280
Two platoons.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.830
Ten or so...

06:17.830 --> 06:20.150
Tohya's succeeded in luring them out.

06:20.430 --> 06:21.230
Okay...

06:21.230 --> 06:23.020
Start the countdown!

06:23.220 --> 06:24.180
Five,

06:24.180 --> 06:25.230
four,

06:25.230 --> 06:26.030
three,

06:26.260 --> 06:27.260
two,

06:27.260 --> 06:28.210
one...

06:28.210 --> 06:28.840
Zero!

06:33.020 --> 06:34.790
<i>Willow Spirits!</i>

06:37.040 --> 06:38.210
I've rooted them!

06:38.210 --> 06:39.040
Okay!

06:39.270 --> 06:40.230
Here I go.

06:40.230 --> 06:42.210
<i>Icicle Blade!</i>

06:42.700 --> 06:44.550
Thank you, Rudy!

06:44.910 --> 06:47.490
Save your big spells and 
attack small-scale for now.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.990
I'll back you up for thirty seconds.

06:48.990 --> 06:49.680
Got it.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.730
Second wave at two o'clock.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.220
<i>Flare Arrow!</i>

06:56.690 --> 06:58.480
<i>Maestro Echo!</i>

07:03.970 --> 07:05.970
Wonderful, Miss Isuzu.

07:05.970 --> 07:07.000
Not now!

07:06.510 --> 07:10.980
<b>Seconds Left</b>

07:07.000 --> 07:09.630
Once your cool down finishes, attack again!

07:09.630 --> 07:10.990
Leave it to me.

07:14.770 --> 07:18.500
If they aren't able to rely on the Izumo Knights...

07:18.790 --> 07:23.000
That would make us their only other option.

07:23.530 --> 07:26.050
As long as we're here, in this world,

07:26.480 --> 07:29.280
we won't be able to avoid fighting in its wars.

07:29.810 --> 07:33.630
But it wouldn't be a good idea for either side

07:33.630 --> 07:36.010
to hand over its soldiers easily.

07:36.380 --> 07:40.020
We'll need to do this properly, you're saying?

07:40.290 --> 07:44.770
Yes, and for that, I'd like us to 
agree on something in advance.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.430
Another of your plans?

07:47.430 --> 07:49.030
Way to go, villain in glasses.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.110
It's nothing that special.

07:52.780 --> 07:56.870
I think we three should decide 
our roles in advance.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.370
Our roles, huh?

08:05.650 --> 08:07.380
<i>The goblin attack...</i>

08:07.810 --> 08:10.880
<i>I've never seen Father look so serious.</i>

08:11.650 --> 08:14.180
<i>How intense will the fighting be?</i>

08:14.600 --> 08:16.890
It'll have to be Tsukuba.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.250
It's well defended,

08:19.250 --> 08:21.940
and should last a long time.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.150
But who will tell Lord Kiliva?

08:24.500 --> 08:27.150
He'll lose more than a few 
fields and outlying villages.

08:27.150 --> 08:29.580
In the worst case, most of the population.

08:33.290 --> 08:36.630
I'm sure everyone is thinking 
in the back of their minds

08:36.630 --> 08:39.380
that asking the adventurers 
would be the right move.

08:40.010 --> 08:43.670
Yes... If they die, they return to life.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.640
But that would mean owing them a large debt.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.710
Which is why we avoid showing 
them our vulnerability,

08:50.710 --> 08:53.670
while getting information from 
them by any means necessary.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.680
And they cannot learn that the Izumo 
Knights are gone, no matter what.

08:59.310 --> 09:02.320
Ultimately, we know nothing about them.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.780
We need them to be our shield, 
even if it means lying to them.

09:08.430 --> 09:10.830
They've finally called us?

09:10.830 --> 09:13.950
I hear the West Wind Brigade has arrived, too.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.700
Yes, they just contacted me.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.200
It's huge.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.220
They'll have to wait until the conference ends...

09:27.840 --> 09:29.090
Well, if it isn't...

09:31.960 --> 09:32.380
Umâ€”

09:32.380 --> 09:33.800
Is something wrong?

09:34.810 --> 09:37.550
I'd imagined you'd be asleep in 
your soft bed at this hour.

09:40.950 --> 09:42.780
It's true that you may

09:42.780 --> 09:46.560
see me as nothing but a lazy, cowardly girl.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.600
But I am also a member of the duke's family.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.440
There are nights when I'm too worried to sleep.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.070
I apologize.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.370
Well?

09:55.120 --> 09:57.820
You seemed to have something you wanted to say.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.640
Didn't you say that freedom requires resolve?

10:06.640 --> 10:07.470
Yes.

10:07.930 --> 10:09.830
I haven't forgotten those words.

10:10.050 --> 10:12.550
That's all I wanted to say.

10:19.810 --> 10:21.960
Yes, we're all right.

10:22.420 --> 10:25.690
I think we've wiped out all 
the enemies in this area.

10:25.690 --> 10:27.640
We're resting now.

10:28.770 --> 10:30.770
Proceeding north-northwest, yes?

10:31.320 --> 10:32.260
Yes.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.490
Three kilometers or so.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.150
Roger.

10:35.150 --> 10:38.030
You and Nyanta both be careful.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.260
Mage's Gauntlets?

10:43.260 --> 10:44.250
Yes!

10:44.250 --> 10:46.920
Nyanta identified them for me.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.630
They're an item for magical attackers.

10:50.630 --> 10:53.500
As long as you're above level 25, 
you can equip them.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.760
Level 25?

10:54.760 --> 10:57.270
Then they can't be that great...

10:57.270 --> 11:01.480
But they're the first item we 
acquired by working together.

11:02.310 --> 11:03.100
Yeah.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.990
We worked together in Lagranda 
Forest to get them.

11:06.990 --> 11:09.100
Doesn't that make them an amazing treasure?

11:09.390 --> 11:11.080
Yes, that's right.

11:11.660 --> 11:13.200
But what do we do with them?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.660
We can't all use them.

11:17.420 --> 11:18.860
Um...

11:19.220 --> 11:21.060
Why don't we let Rudy use them?

11:21.990 --> 11:25.010
You said it's an item for 
magical attackers, right?

11:25.410 --> 11:26.610
That's right.

11:26.610 --> 11:29.760
Rudy's the only mage in our group.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.750
Um, but something that important...

11:32.750 --> 11:34.910
That isn't like you, Rudy!

11:34.910 --> 11:36.140
Since when are you so modest?

11:36.140 --> 11:37.430
What do you think I am?

11:37.430 --> 11:38.690
B-But...

11:38.690 --> 11:41.430
Well, are you sure?

11:46.470 --> 11:48.600
They look good on you, Rudy.

11:50.230 --> 11:52.160
Let's get going.

11:52.160 --> 11:56.040
We'll head down into the ravine, 
keeping watch as we move.

11:56.040 --> 11:56.690
Okay...

11:57.120 --> 12:00.450
I swear by these gauntlets that 
I'll defeat even more next time.

12:00.730 --> 12:02.700
Don't get too fired up.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.950
What? Is it bad to be fired up?

12:08.390 --> 12:10.290
No, let's do our best!

12:11.970 --> 12:14.960
And so, for these reasons,

12:15.640 --> 12:19.470
we lords of the Freedom Cities of Eastal feel

12:19.930 --> 12:21.950
that in this emergency situation...

12:20.670 --> 12:23.610
Hey, we aren't getting anywhere.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.890
They're probably waiting for us to say something.

12:27.660 --> 12:31.810
We both want more information about what 
the other's thinking, to gain an advantage.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.810
So we'll go with the plan.

12:35.580 --> 12:40.190
I'll talk about agreeing to send troops, 
to try and gain information.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.070
<i>If this is how they want to play it, 
there's no need to hold back.</i>

12:45.710 --> 12:49.540
If anyone knows the status of the 
Izumo Knights, please tell me.

12:51.050 --> 12:54.210
<i>Oh, that's even worse than I expected.</i>

12:54.210 --> 12:59.710
It seems clear that, for some reason, 
the Izumo Knights won't be coming.

13:00.620 --> 13:04.220
We cannot bring the Izumo 
Knights into a war like this!

13:04.430 --> 13:07.750
I would rather ask the Akihabara Round Table.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.930
With Akihabara in danger, why do you not rise?

13:10.930 --> 13:13.530
You're asking us to send troops?

13:13.530 --> 13:15.480
W-Well...

13:15.760 --> 13:18.700
I'd thought the purpose of this 
conference was to hear

13:18.700 --> 13:20.900
each individual lord's thoughts...

13:21.570 --> 13:25.000
Or did you simply hope to hear our opinions?

13:25.910 --> 13:30.040
I-I'd heard the Akihabara knights 
were unmatched in combat...

13:30.220 --> 13:35.460
If you're using "knights" to mean a 
standing force, ready for battle,

13:35.940 --> 13:40.880
neither Akihabara nor the Round 
Table has any such thing.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.220
Then what are you adventurers good for?

13:44.510 --> 13:46.220
What does that mean?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.000
What else?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.210
The adventurers' abilities are 
a blessing from the gods!

13:51.210 --> 13:52.970
You have a duty to save the land!

13:53.410 --> 13:55.980
That's news to me...

13:56.420 --> 13:58.450
What nonsense is that?!

13:58.450 --> 14:00.010
You're invincible, immortal.

14:00.010 --> 14:04.650
And despite that, you would 
abandon your duty to the land?!

14:04.650 --> 14:06.040
You should be ashamed!

14:07.800 --> 14:08.950
Shut up!

14:11.260 --> 14:15.420
First off, we are not citizens 
of the Freedom Cities!

14:15.420 --> 14:19.510
That's why we weren't summoned 
to the conference before.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.250
Am I wrong?!

14:21.270 --> 14:24.250
I don't know what plot you've devised,

14:24.250 --> 14:27.010
but we have no obligation 
to accede to your demands.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.450
Don't you agree, Baron Krendit?!

14:30.450 --> 14:32.010
Th-That isn't...

14:32.330 --> 14:36.000
We didn't mean... Well...

14:36.750 --> 14:43.020
We are most certainly not plotting 
to get Akihabara to send troops.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.540
Then it was Lord Kiliva's individual request

14:46.540 --> 14:53.030
that Akihabara send troops, not the will 
of the League of Freedom Cities?

14:53.750 --> 14:59.170
Are you saying that I'm acting 
for my own benefit here?!

14:59.810 --> 15:01.980
It is not the will of the entire League.

15:01.980 --> 15:06.670
But it's also true that many of us 
within the League feel that way.

15:07.050 --> 15:10.540
Or will the proud, mighty warriors of Akihabara

15:10.540 --> 15:14.180
stand aside while Yamato faces its hour of peril?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.430
We are not pets...

15:16.900 --> 15:20.190
"You guys are immortal, so go 
and kill the goblins for us"?

15:20.620 --> 15:25.060
Anyone who believed that, and sent 
their comrades to the battlefield

15:25.060 --> 15:28.470
could never gain the people of Akihabara's trust!

15:32.920 --> 15:34.200
Was that too much?

15:35.430 --> 15:38.370
<i>The adventurers risk losing their memories.</i>

15:39.120 --> 15:41.880
<i>Anyone would get mad about that, not just you.</i>

15:41.880 --> 15:44.880
<i>And it's your job to oppose sending troops.</i>

15:45.610 --> 15:46.380
<i>But...</i>

15:47.360 --> 15:48.880
<i>Yeah, that may have been a bit much.</i>

15:49.450 --> 15:51.840
I'm not sure where we go from here...

16:03.490 --> 16:04.770
Lenessia...

16:16.080 --> 16:19.800
<i>What... What am I doing?</i>

16:19.800 --> 16:22.210
You're looking as beautiful as ever.

16:22.210 --> 16:24.900
Like a fairy on a lake, on a moonlit night.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.670
<i>I shouldn't have come here.</i>

16:29.180 --> 16:30.450
<i>I shouldn't have come.</i>

16:31.000 --> 16:32.480
<i>I shouldn't have come.</i>

16:34.950 --> 16:37.530
<i>I want to put on my flannel 
pajamas and go to bed...</i>

16:37.530 --> 16:40.550
<i>I want to put my face down on 
a cold table and lie there.</i>

16:41.260 --> 16:43.810
<i>Are you not slacking off today?</i>

16:45.900 --> 16:47.020
<i>Did I imagine that?</i>

16:47.020 --> 16:48.500
<i>I'm sure I heard it.</i>

16:48.500 --> 16:51.020
<i>No, it doesn't matter...</i>

16:51.020 --> 16:53.740
<i>Of course I want to slack off, but...</i>

16:56.100 --> 16:57.740
Lenessia...

16:58.280 --> 16:59.490
Sir Crusty...

17:01.220 --> 17:03.260
Yes, Princess Lenessia?

17:03.670 --> 17:05.750
I am going to Akihabara.

17:06.030 --> 17:07.250
Accompany me.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.800
To Akihabara? Why?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.470
To raise an army of volunteers.

17:15.020 --> 17:17.710
<i>Impossible... What can a single woman do?</i>

17:17.710 --> 17:20.760
<i>Speaking to a foreign band of 
knights without permission?</i>

17:20.760 --> 17:22.990
<i>That far exceeds her authority...</i>

17:22.990 --> 17:27.350
<i>No, the Round Table's representative 
is going with her...</i>

17:27.350 --> 17:29.650
<i>That could change things.</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:33.110
I'm sure that's likely to be a lot of work.

17:33.110 --> 17:33.930
Yes.

17:33.930 --> 17:35.660
Then why?

17:35.910 --> 17:39.800
You said that adventurers were free.

17:40.550 --> 17:45.670
I'm just a stupid girl, so I don't 
really understand politics.

17:46.010 --> 17:49.490
But I think that when you ask 
someone for something,

17:49.490 --> 17:51.220
you should show respect.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.080
As a member of the duke's family,

17:53.080 --> 17:55.290
that's what my father and 
grandfather taught me.

17:55.290 --> 17:56.180
That's why

17:56.560 --> 17:59.230
I don't think we should be 
hiding things from you.

17:59.650 --> 18:02.680
Including the fact that the 
Izumo Knights are missing!

18:04.060 --> 18:05.250
What has she done?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.730
She's told them our secret!

18:06.730 --> 18:09.320
Well, now you've done it.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.780
When I take responsibility, apologize with me.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.660
And, exactly what are you planning?

18:16.660 --> 18:19.410
I see there are things even you don't know.

18:19.960 --> 18:20.950
Nothing.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.910
I don't have any plan at all.

18:24.680 --> 18:25.330
But...

18:25.930 --> 18:30.590
As a member of the Cowen family, 
I do not wish to be insulting.

18:33.640 --> 18:34.850
Grandfather...

18:35.460 --> 18:36.860
Continue.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.280
Adventurers are free.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.030
They are more free than we are.

18:43.030 --> 18:46.780
It's true that we may be weaker than they are.

18:46.780 --> 18:49.900
But that doesn't mean that, in our weakness, 
we can become aggressive.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.160
We don't have the right to take advantage

18:53.160 --> 18:56.400
of our weakness and use them as tools!

18:56.780 --> 19:01.910
I shall go to Akihabara, and ask 
the adventurers directly.

19:02.220 --> 19:05.670
Sir Crusty said that adventurers are free.

19:05.670 --> 19:08.420
So if any of them will agree to help us,

19:08.820 --> 19:10.670
why would we stop them?

19:11.170 --> 19:15.670
I shall find even ten or fifteen 
that will agree to help us.

19:16.060 --> 19:19.870
I learned from my grandfather 
that showing respect

19:19.870 --> 19:21.680
doesn't mean using fancy words.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.530
I'll go there myself, to stand in the street,

19:24.530 --> 19:28.180
and speak to each adventurer individually!

19:33.620 --> 19:34.620
Princess Lenessia!

19:34.620 --> 19:35.970
It's fine.

19:35.970 --> 19:37.720
She was just very nervous.

19:38.270 --> 19:40.030
Can I leave the rest of this to you?

19:40.530 --> 19:43.420
I couldn't. That would be a waste.

19:43.420 --> 19:44.780
So what will you do?

19:45.900 --> 19:48.570
Will you accept her resolve, or not?

19:48.570 --> 19:51.360
The final decision lies with you.

20:02.690 --> 20:03.860
A bird?

20:06.870 --> 20:09.520
It's scary out here at night.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.730
There are probably all kinds 
of enemies still out here.

20:12.330 --> 20:13.510
<i>It's true.</i>

20:13.510 --> 20:16.990
<i>We've only defeated a tiny 
percentage of the goblins.</i>

20:17.280 --> 20:20.360
<i>No matter how many we kill, it may not matter.</i>

20:20.830 --> 20:23.060
It's even scarier when the fighting starts.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.720
You can trip on roots and soft ground.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.370
Yeah, you lose your balance easily.

20:28.370 --> 20:32.160
I'm always anxious because I never know 
when the enemy will appear.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.950
Maybe it's because you're 
on higher alert at night...

20:34.950 --> 20:36.710
Like for the scent of the monsters.

20:36.710 --> 20:37.670
Yeah...

20:37.670 --> 20:40.160
I hate that scent.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.710
But...

20:42.660 --> 20:44.650
It's okay to do our best!

20:44.650 --> 20:46.270
It's okay for us to try and save them!

20:46.270 --> 20:48.310
Yeah, it's just fine!

20:48.310 --> 20:49.930
Yes, of course.

20:50.350 --> 20:54.650
If you'd leave behind people in trouble, 
how can you be an adventurer?

20:55.500 --> 20:56.870
<i>That's right...</i>

20:56.870 --> 20:59.470
<i>We don't need to think about anything else.</i>

20:59.880 --> 21:02.500
<i>We'll all protect the people we care about.</i>

21:02.500 --> 21:04.200
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

21:04.620 --> 21:07.620
<i>And as a shrine priestess,</i>

21:07.980 --> 21:10.750
<i>my job is to keep us all safe.</i>

21:18.190 --> 21:20.340
Why are you laughing, my lord?

21:20.340 --> 21:23.050
I've never seen Crusty looking like that.

21:23.610 --> 21:25.800
He was totally overwhelmed.

21:26.130 --> 21:28.400
That princess impresses me.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.310
I didn't expect her to do that there.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.340
It's about respect, huh?

21:32.340 --> 21:33.450
Respect?

21:33.450 --> 21:34.500
Yes.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.440
Even if the Round Table promised to send troops,

21:37.440 --> 21:39.940
it wouldn't mean Akihabara would act.

21:40.580 --> 21:43.560
Because, as she said, adventurers are free.

21:44.420 --> 21:48.980
If you want them to act, you need 
to persuade each one individually.

21:49.490 --> 21:53.230
And she seemed to understand that perfectly.

21:53.230 --> 21:56.210
She said she'd do all she could to 
show respect at that meeting.

21:56.570 --> 22:00.010
But in a way, isn't that obvious?

22:00.010 --> 22:02.800
Yes, you're right.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.850
But everyone there was about to ignore it.

22:06.860 --> 22:08.230
Including us.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.940
What's that light?

22:12.940 --> 22:14.340
The city of Akihabara.

22:16.090 --> 22:17.230
It's night...

22:17.850 --> 22:19.420
But the light is so warm...

22:23.640 --> 22:28.490
<i>She may be the one who saves the Freedom 
Cities of Eastal from the dead end</i>

22:28.490 --> 22:30.800
<i>in which they've found themselves.</i>

22:32.020 --> 22:34.260
<i>That lazy, cowardly princess...</i>

24:05.770 --> 24:07.460
She finds herself in a town she doesn't know

24:07.460 --> 24:08.700
with things she's never seen,

24:08.700 --> 24:09.970
things she's never heard,

24:09.970 --> 24:11.800
and people she's never met.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.010
She learns how big the world is, 
and how tiny she is.

24:15.470 --> 24:18.410
She cries out her resolve and her hope.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.840
And her words drive the adventurers to action.

24:22.230 --> 24:29.990
<b>Expeditionary Force</b>

24:22.410 --> 24:24.360
Next time: Expeditionary Force.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.000
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
