00:01.126 --> 00:02.457
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.628 --> 00:04.084
- The Troubles are back, aren't they?

00:04.254 --> 00:06.870
- In Haven, people have
the ability to do things.

00:07.049 --> 00:10.758
- We found that in our newspaper
archives from 27 years ago.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.839
- Who is she?
- l was hoping you could tell me.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.217
- I know that picture, Colorado Kid murder.
She looks like you.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.635
- Where's the Colorado Kid buried?

00:17.809 --> 00:19.549
- It's a very old case, Agent Parker.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.354
- No more lies!

00:21.522 --> 00:23.683
All this time I have been
searching for my identity,

00:23.815 --> 00:26.192
and you knew who I was?
- You were Lucy.

00:26.318 --> 00:27.649
There's a lot
we don't understand.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.609
- How you always look the same.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.941
You have a new person's memory
each time you return.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.197
- You always help
the Troubled when you do.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.029
- This conversation is not over.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.410
- You told her too much.
- She needs my help.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.536
You're not getting
in my way this time.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.663
- Somebody out there
with a tattoo wants to kill me.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.961
- What happened
to honour amongst thieves?

00:46.004 --> 00:48.586
- No!
(shouting)

00:48.757 --> 00:50.748
Your father,
I think he was looking for me.

00:50.926 --> 00:54.089
"It's up to you to finish my work.
You must kill her."

00:54.263 --> 00:56.174
Why did he want you to kill me?

00:56.348 --> 00:58.213
You seriously can't feel pain?
- No.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.257
- What's wrong?
- I can feel you.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.596
- How long have you known?
- A while.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.762
- Are you in love?
- I don't know what it is.

01:04.940 --> 01:08.398
- Well, stop. You two can't be in love,
she's just too important to this town.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.276
You have got to keep her alive,
understand me?

01:13.365 --> 01:15.026
- Nathan, you're early.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.151
- Parker?

01:19.204 --> 01:22.287
Duke, what did you do with her?
- Audrey's missing?

01:22.457 --> 01:24.448
I swear I didn't do anything to her.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.706
- Five seconds.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.037
FOUL”

01:27.212 --> 01:28.952
- If I was gonna hurt Audrey...
- Three...

01:29.548 --> 01:31.664
- I would have been waiting for you.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.597
- I'm done counting.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.061
- Okay, all right. Wait.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.029
Just wait.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.617
(gunshot, grunting)

02:26.229 --> 02:28.185
- Upside of not being able to feel...

02:28.315 --> 02:30.727
I can do this all day.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.969
Are you doing this?

03:05.143 --> 03:07.099
- No.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.143
- You just punched me
across the room.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.816
- Yes, that's true.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.272
But my thing is different, Nathan.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.358
When the blood
of a Troubled person touches me,

03:19.533 --> 03:22.616
I can feel it, there's a surge.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.154
| get stronger.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.953
But this...

03:27.207 --> 03:28.322
This?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.741
Not me.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.284
- Where is Audrey?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.293
- I told you, man, I don't know.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.920
| wish I did.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.422
(door opening)

03:43.306 --> 03:45.433
(door closing)

03:59.948 --> 04:02.530
- I'm going to ask you one more time.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.033
Where's the Colorado Kid?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.618
- Go to hell.

04:13.712 --> 04:17.170
(theme song)

04:45.035 --> 04:46.696
- What the hell is going on, man?

04:46.870 --> 04:50.158
You show up
with that thing on your arm.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.746
What is that supposed to mean?

04:51.875 --> 04:53.081
- If you're supposed to die

04:53.210 --> 04:55.166
at the hands of somebody
with this tattoo,

04:55.295 --> 04:56.910
I need to be
on the approved list.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.084
- Nathan, I am not the enemy.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.084
- Your father, your grandfather,
his father before that,

05:03.220 --> 05:06.257
they all killed Troubled people
to wipe out their curses.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.846
You don't think
any of them had any doubts?

05:08.975 --> 05:11.432
You just think you're special?

05:11.603 --> 05:13.059
(clanging)

05:15.565 --> 05:17.772
- I'm gonna go with special.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.850
Nathan...

05:19.986 --> 05:21.601
Whoever took Audrey,

05:21.738 --> 05:23.569
they planted that whistle
in her apartment,

05:23.740 --> 05:26.072
so you would find it
and come after me.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.944
They want us to kill each other.
We are playing right into their hands.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.088
I'm not my father.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.274
- What was that?
- I don't know.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.476
I don't know.
I mean, I was just driving by.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.484
- It's about time
somebody got here.

06:02.612 --> 06:06.605
Can you help me? The thing literally
fell out of the sky onto the truck.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.489
Wham. And I'm supposed to see
that guy making the turn?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.116
I thought it was
the end of the world.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.994
- Third one of these
we've blown in three years.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.408
You'd think now
they might retrofit the pipes.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.948
I say it all the time:

06:16.084 --> 06:18.075
Town's only as strong
as its infrastructure.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.246
People don't listen.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.971
Nathan.
What happened to your face?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.464
- Ran into a door.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.605
- Was that intentionally hostile?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.899
- Last time I saw you,
you were throwing me off a boat.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.642
- lf memory serves, you were...
you were being a bad boy too that day.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.780
- I guess I haven't learned my lesson.
- Guess you haven't learned your lesson.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.407
- Enough.
- What?

06:51.536 --> 06:54.744
- Parker's missing. Someone took her
from her apartment.

06:54.915 --> 06:55.870
- Nathan...

06:56.041 --> 06:57.702
- I need you to get a handle
on whatever this was.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.412
Last thing I need
with Audrey missing

06:59.544 --> 07:01.785
is somebody's Trouble
sending people into a panic.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.537
- Looks like it was
some kind of magnetic force.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.254
Followed a line
from the harbour to here,

07:05.383 --> 07:07.419
picked up everything
up to a couple hundred pounds.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.631
l'm blaming it on the gas line.
- Good. Handle it.

07:12.682 --> 07:13.762
Duke.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.346
- Guy threw a manhole cover at me.
Okay? I'm just saying.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.134
- Stan, is the APB out?
- Yeah, but...

07:18.313 --> 07:20.975
- I know you got a lot of calls coming,
but Audrey's a priority.

07:21.107 --> 07:25.316
- Nathan, another woman was abducted
out by the Altair Bay Inn.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.811
Maybe it's connected to Audrey.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.337
- We couldn't do this over the phone?

07:54.516 --> 07:56.723
- I don't think so.
Audrey's missing.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.686
She was taken by someone.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.104
- What? Who?

08:00.271 --> 08:01.727
- Do you think Dave could be involved?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.563
- Well, I don't know.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.940
He and l are getting

08:06.069 --> 08:10.403
very close to the edge
of things these days.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.189
- Vince?

08:15.203 --> 08:16.443
- That's odd.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.871
Oh, my.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.631
- Let me do the talking.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.218
- Are you the police?

08:41.396 --> 08:43.307
- Chief Wuornos, Haven PD.
Wesley Toomey?

08:43.481 --> 08:45.972
- They took my mother, Roslyn.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.475
Come inside.
There isn't much time.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.440
We're closed until mid-spring,

08:51.573 --> 08:55.942
but Mom likes to come in
and dust once a month.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.578
l was supposed to meet her.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.152
- Your family owns the inn?

08:59.330 --> 09:00.831
- She inherited it
from my grandfather.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.700
- Sure she didn't just get the time wrong
and go for a walk, something like that?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.368
- Boating accident took her leg
about five years ago.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.710
She doesn't do walks anymore.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.757
I want you to know, the scene
is exactly how I found it.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.876
Nothing's been compromised.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.966
Back here.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.233
- You find blood
in Audrey's apartment?

09:31.362 --> 09:32.397
- No.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.565
- What are you talking about?

09:33.698 --> 09:35.939
- There was another disappearance
about two hours ago.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.441
Where were you
before you came here?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.817
- l was at home.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.740
That doesn't matter,
I know who did this.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.076
- Who?
- Aliens.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.542
- You think that aliens
abducted your mother?

09:48.671 --> 09:50.957
- All you have to do
is look at the blood.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.252
She lost consciousness here,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.124
after they inserted
the nasal probe.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.467
- Really?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.463
- Then they dragged her
through this door.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.306
Feet first, facedown,
which is standard.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.300
- Standard?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.894
- We don't have time for this.
- Just go with it.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.607
- Then it was up and away.

10:10.777 --> 10:15.111
They usually use
a lightweight shuttle-type craft.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.151
They're softening us up.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.195
- Softening us up.
For what?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.944
- They're coming.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.743
- The mother ship.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.582
- We can't do anything about my mom
or anybody else they took.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.043
But there is still a chance
that we can stop them.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.460
That's why I called you out here.
If I told you this story on the phone,

10:34.592 --> 10:35.707
nobody would believe me.

10:35.844 --> 10:40.258
- Plus they could be listening. I mean...

10:40.390 --> 10:43.097
we probably shouldn't be
talking here.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.516
No. See, if we want to strategize,
we should probably do this

10:48.690 --> 10:50.726
back at the station,
where it's more secure.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.019
- But there's no time.
l have to go back home.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.393
l have to calibrate the monitoring equip--
- Hey.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.441
Do you think your setup
is better than Haven PD's?

10:59.242 --> 11:00.527
Tell him, Nathan.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.619
- We just upgraded.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.412
- Let me go lock up.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.539
- Okay. Right.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.916
Relax. Okay, look.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.882
I've dealt with crazies
like this out at sea.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.296
He just needs to feel
like we're on his side.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.262
- Well, he may have
offed his mother, Duke.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.382
- Yeah, I don't really care
about his mother,

11:25.518 --> 11:29.056
but I care if he knows
something about Audrey.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.850
He just...

11:32.317 --> 11:37.402
He needs to feel like we trust him
if he's gonna trust us. Okay?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.406
- Okay, but this can't go on forever.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.368
(engine revving)
- Okay, I was wrong.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.643
(door opening)
(Audrey whimpering)

12:08.311 --> 12:09.300
(door closing)

12:19.697 --> 12:22.655
- Ask yourself
if this is how you want to die,

12:22.825 --> 12:24.781
because I'm starting
to lose my patience.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.867
Where is he?

12:28.206 --> 12:30.288
- I already told you.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.500
He died 27 years ago.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.915
I didn't know him,
I never met him.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.962
| just saw a picture,
that's it.

12:42.095 --> 12:47.010
- You're lying.
- Listen. You don't understand.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.299
There was this other woman,
and she looked like me,

12:49.477 --> 12:51.433
and she must have known him.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.269
- You think I don't know
you two are the same person?

12:54.399 --> 12:56.014
- What?

12:56.150 --> 12:57.651
- Stop playing games with me.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.393
- Who are you?

13:00.571 --> 13:02.357
- Somebody who deserves
to be told the truth.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.481
You stand there
so smug and possessive.

13:04.617 --> 13:09.407
You think you're the only one
who loved the Colorado Kid?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.002
(Nathan): Suspect's name
is Wesley Toomey.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.164
He's unstable,
should be considered dangerous.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.294
We're in pursuit,
heading north on State Road.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.971
He's gotta be just over the crest.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.057
- What are you doing?

13:32.228 --> 13:34.640
You're letting him get away.
He's our only link to Audrey.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.350
What's going on?
Why are you slowing down?

13:36.524 --> 13:39.106
- I'm not. The engine just died.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.817
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.777
- Dead.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.045
- Phones are dead too.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.546
What the hell is going on?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.216
- Damn it.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.674
Come on, Parker.
Where are you?

14:16.022 --> 14:19.139
(woman): Hello? Is someone there?

14:19.275 --> 14:23.939
Please, I know you're there.
Please, talk to me.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.109
- Where are you?
- Oh, thank God.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.740
I think I'm on the other side
of the wall from you.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.109
- Are you hurt?

14:31.871 --> 14:36.331
- These ropes are cutting
into my wrists. I'm scared.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.957
I don't want to die like this.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.243
- Nobody's gonna die here, okay?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.209
What's your name?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.716
- lt's Roslyn.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.756
- Roslyn, l'm Audrey.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.971
All right? I'm a police officer.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.512
So we're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.054
- How?

14:56.187 --> 14:59.224
- I don't know, but you need to not panic.
All right?

14:59.357 --> 15:02.269
We're gonna just keep talking,
and we're gonna figure this out.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.986
- Okay.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.196
Just promise me I can trust you.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.315
- Listen, l'm tied up too, okay?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.407
I promise.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.412
He's been asking me information
about the Colorado Kid.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.908
Did he ask you about him too?

15:20.044 --> 15:21.580
Maybe we're here
for the same reason.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.543
- Yes, |-| told him

15:23.673 --> 15:27.086
the Colorado Kid was a guest here,
but years ago.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.000
- Here?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.252
- At the Altair Bay Inn.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.426
I'm the owner.
That's where we are.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.599
- Okay, try it.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.693
- It's not an engine problem, Nathan.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.400
- Can't say that yet.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.773
- Okay, then how do you explain
the phones, all right?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.111
This is something else.

15:53.244 --> 15:56.361
- Yeah, maybe it's aliens.
Maybe Wesley was right.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.703
- Yeah, maybe it is aliens.

15:57.832 --> 16:01.074
I mean, would that be the weirdest thing
that ever happened in Haven?

16:01.210 --> 16:02.746
- Just try it again.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.415
- Okay, maybe it's not aliens.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.003
Maybe it's someone's Trouble.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.248
But I am telling you
it is not an engine problem!

16:08.384 --> 16:10.420
- Go back and try it again.

16:10.553 --> 16:14.592
- Nathan, you can't fix this.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.385
Listen to me. Hey!

16:16.559 --> 16:19.175
- You've been telling me
what I can't do since we were kids.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.928
Now Audrey's missing,
we're stuck in the middle of nowhere!

16:22.064 --> 16:24.851
Do not tell me I can't fix this!
I'm gonna fix this.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.108
- This is not helping!

16:27.236 --> 16:30.228
Will you please stop
acting like a lovesick child?

16:30.406 --> 16:33.193
- What?
- You are in love with Audrey.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.983
What, did you think
that was a secret?

16:36.162 --> 16:37.493
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.698
- No, I do.
I understand how you feel.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.911
- No, you don't
understand anything.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.702
- No, I understand that if you--

16:41.876 --> 16:44.834
- When Audrey touches me,
I can feel it.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.290
She's the only one I can feel.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.335
- What?

16:50.593 --> 16:52.549
- She's the only one.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.769
- Nathan! Nathan!

17:03.564 --> 17:05.429
Nathan!

17:07.443 --> 17:09.104
Nathan!

17:14.075 --> 17:16.066
Nathan.
You okay?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.451
- Yeah, I think so.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.112
What the hell was that?

17:22.959 --> 17:26.417
- You may want to reconsider
your stance on aliens.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.138
(Duke): Looks like we're standing
in some kind of crop circle.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.395
(beeping)

17:46.566 --> 17:49.182
- The power's back on.
- The truck should be working.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.282
Then there's that.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.460
- Roslyn, are you okay?

18:17.597 --> 18:20.339
- Oh, my God, what was that?

18:20.474 --> 18:21.850
- I don't know.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.217
But whatever it was,
it didn't miss us by much.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.266
Great.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.355
- Audrey, what's happening?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.691
- Uh, there's a fire.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.628
It's out.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.625
- Oh, thank God.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.482
(Duke): Where do you think
Wesley was going?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.234
(Nathan): I don't know.
Let's track the meteor.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.399
I think it landed near the inn.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.606
And there's his bike.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.909
So that thing fell at Wesley's house.
It's quite a coincidence.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.909
- No, no, no, no, no!

19:31.045 --> 19:33.001
Please, don't!
You don't get it!

19:34.340 --> 19:35.625
But I need to get my equipment.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.215
- You can't be in there.
- You don't understand!

19:38.344 --> 19:39.459
What are you...
What are you doing?

19:45.226 --> 19:47.342
- What the hell
makes a crater like that?

19:47.478 --> 19:49.844
- A geo probe.

19:50.815 --> 19:51.930
They're in their final stages.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.931
- Could have been debris
from a satellite.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.558
It doesn't have to be big.
- Good.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.935
Might wanna tell the looky-loos that,

19:57.071 --> 19:59.437
so they don't think
the world's about to end.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.529
- What do you think is gonna happen
if I don't disrupt their nav system?

20:03.828 --> 20:07.116
What's wrong with you?!
You want us all to die?!

20:07.248 --> 20:09.455
- A few clubs short of a full set, huh?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.119
- Yeah.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.288
Be nice to have a better theory
than his though.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.661
- Maybe he's Troubled.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.630
- Did you ever come up with something
for that magnetic incident in town?

20:17.758 --> 20:20.170
- No. You think there's a connection?
- Looks like it.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.714
The power loss, this, crop circle.

20:22.847 --> 20:23.962
- Crop circle?

20:24.098 --> 20:26.714
- Nathan.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.307
Any word on Audrey?

20:28.436 --> 20:31.303
- No.

20:31.439 --> 20:34.397
All this running around I'm doing,
I don't know if I'm getting any closer.

20:34.525 --> 20:37.141
- She's the toughest person I know.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.736
- Hey, you guys want to see this.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.279
- Where the hell have you been?

20:46.412 --> 20:49.324
- There have been some incidents
that need managing,

20:49.457 --> 20:50.663
if you haven't noticed.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.452
- What about
Audrey's disappearance?

20:52.585 --> 20:53.950
Are you managing that too?

20:54.086 --> 20:57.203
- Don't let your imagination
get the best of you.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.759
- Take a look at this.

21:07.892 --> 21:11.680
Look familiar?

21:11.812 --> 21:14.053
- lt's identical
to what happened outside.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.150
- Here's another good one.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.316
"Mysterious force drags officer
into crop circle.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.985
"Sioux City officer Alvin Hills

21:25.117 --> 21:28.200
"never saw what grabbed him
by the ankles and dragged him

21:28.329 --> 21:32.117
into a cornfield
late Tuesday afternoon."

21:32.249 --> 21:35.457
Everything that's happening now
has happened before.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.338
- Or maybe Wesley
just thinks it's happened.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.344
I mean, these aren't
legitimate magazines,

21:47.515 --> 21:50.882
this is conspiracy-theory trash.
- Might not matter.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.179
- No, if the boy's Troubled,

21:53.312 --> 21:56.725
what counts
is what's real in his mind.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.561
- So Wesley's obsessed
over these stories,

21:59.693 --> 22:00.899
and now he's reproducing them.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.856
Could've been triggered
by his mom's disappearance.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.691
- There's something here
you should see.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.906
Everything on this wall
happened here today,

22:07.034 --> 22:09.400
except for two articles.

22:09.537 --> 22:13.701
"Lights over Portland,"
"Aliens level hillside enclave."

22:13.874 --> 22:16.286
- Okay, the lights part sounds fine,

22:16.418 --> 22:19.660
but the last part...
that actually sounds bad.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.378
- South Dakota.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.338
Probably happened after a tornado.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.298
Unless you subscribed to this magazine,

22:25.469 --> 22:28.256
in which case it was blast from a UFO.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.630
- Wesley's mother ship.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.759
He keeps saying it's coming.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.397
- Coming where?

22:38.732 --> 22:40.893
This wiped out
a small neighbourhood.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.935
So does Wesley's version happen here?
The harbour?

22:44.113 --> 22:48.732
- No, given our luck,
it'll just be all of Haven.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.414
- Ow!

22:58.544 --> 23:00.876
- Are you okay?

23:05.509 --> 23:06.965
- I can do this.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.425
Just wish I was Nathan right now.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.720
- Who's Nathan?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.392
- He's my partner.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.987
He's a...

23:29.116 --> 23:30.981
little bit better
with pain than I am.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.652
- Talk to me.

23:34.788 --> 23:38.872
l-l feel like I talked your ear off.

23:39.001 --> 23:42.869
Tell me about yourself. It helps.

23:43.047 --> 23:46.665
- No, I should spare you my problems.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.210
You'll be better off.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.417
- Oh, gosh, sweetie.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.421
How bad can it be?
- Well, for starters...

23:53.599 --> 23:56.682
the only real memories
I have of my own life

23:56.810 --> 23:58.391
are from the past six months,

23:58.520 --> 24:04.186
which is complicated,
and it's inconvenient.

24:05.319 --> 24:08.436
But it's not an impossible way to live

24:08.572 --> 24:10.654
unless someone...

24:14.703 --> 24:17.365
Unless someone tells me
something new about my life,

24:17.498 --> 24:21.582
which always seems
to turn my world upside-down.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.552
I guess that doesn't
make any sense, does it?

24:37.559 --> 24:39.720
Roslyn?

24:44.984 --> 24:45.939
Hello?

24:46.110 --> 24:48.522
- Shh. I think he's coming.

24:50.656 --> 24:51.896
What do you want?

24:52.032 --> 24:53.533
No. No!

24:55.619 --> 24:56.904
Where are you taking me?

24:57.037 --> 24:58.743
- Roslyn?

24:58.872 --> 25:02.456
- Don't hurt me!
You're hurting me!

25:02.584 --> 25:05.496
No!
- I'll tell you what you want to know.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.547
I'll tell you about the Colorado Kid!

25:15.639 --> 25:16.970
Roslyn?

25:49.381 --> 25:52.589
- You're not going anywhere
until you tell us what we need to know.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.297
- I don't know where it's going to happen.
I just know that it will.

25:55.471 --> 25:57.632
- And that's the problem,
crazy man.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.421
- Right, because I'm creating
all this with my mind.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.136
The Troubles are a myth.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.509
This is real.
This is science.

26:03.645 --> 26:04.896
My grandfather spent years

26:05.022 --> 26:07.559
teaching me about it
before they took him.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.227
- They?

26:09.359 --> 26:11.520
Your grandfather
was abducted by aliens?

26:11.653 --> 26:13.814
- When I was a kid.
Right in the front yard of the inn.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.323
- Nathan...

26:17.493 --> 26:19.484
(wind whistling)

26:28.879 --> 26:30.744
- Lights in the sky.

26:30.881 --> 26:33.088
- These incidents
seem to be following him.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.503
- They mayjust be following
the ideas he has in his head,

26:35.636 --> 26:37.467
locations that are familiar to him.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.507
- I can start evacuating houses around here.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.256
- That's it? I mean, that's your plan?

26:42.392 --> 26:43.381
You're just gonna let this happen?

26:43.560 --> 26:47.599
- No, we're taking precautions.
(phone ringing)

26:48.357 --> 26:49.517
Wuornos.

26:49.650 --> 26:52.357
- Nathan...
- Audrey? Where are you? Are you okay?

26:52.528 --> 26:53.517
- A man took me.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.440
- What man?
- He has Roslyn.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.528
I've gotta find her.
- Wait, who?

26:57.658 --> 26:59.990
- Roslyn. She's the owner of the inn.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.031
She was with me.
- With you where?

27:03.163 --> 27:06.326
Parker, we have her son. He needs to see her.
This could stop his Trouble.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.491
Where are you?
- I’m at the Altair Bay Inn.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.838
(door opening, closing)

27:13.924 --> 27:16.882
Nathan, someone’s here.

27:18.428 --> 27:19.964
- Parker?

27:20.097 --> 27:21.462
Audrey?

27:21.598 --> 27:24.010
Audrey!

27:25.102 --> 27:26.137
- Nathan, what?

27:26.270 --> 27:28.056
- She's at the inn.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.894
- It's just up the road.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.524
(Audrey screaming)

28:15.694 --> 28:17.855
- Shh! Shh!

28:17.988 --> 28:20.900
Audrey, it's me. It's me.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.734
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.485
- Audrey.

28:38.842 --> 28:39.957
You okay?

28:40.093 --> 28:42.220
- Nathan, he's still here.
I've heard him moving around,

28:42.387 --> 28:44.252
and I didn't hear a car leave;
I'm pretty sure that he has Roslyn.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.925
- Slow down.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.264
- And I promised her that
nothing would happen to her.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.643
You have no idea
what we went through down there.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.260
- No, I don't. I'm sorry.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.977
But we have a situation.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.017
This is Wesley, he's Roslyn's son,
and he's Troubled.

28:55.150 --> 28:57.391
- How can you stand
in front of her and say that?

28:57.527 --> 28:59.267
Look at her.
She was taken too.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.191
- Not by aliens.
- Aliens?

29:02.324 --> 29:04.235
- Wesley thinks his mother
was abducted by aliens

29:04.368 --> 29:08.202
and they're preparing to destroy Haven.
- Because it's happening.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.786
- Is that the explosion
that I heard?

29:09.915 --> 29:10.904
- Yeah, that was part of it.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.244
- And it's about to get
a whole lot worse.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.958
- Roslyn couldn't
have been taken by aliens

29:15.087 --> 29:17.203
because she was taken
by the same man who took me.

29:17.339 --> 29:20.297
- Do you hear that, Wesley?
- You think it was a man?

29:20.425 --> 29:21.710
What did he look like?

29:22.803 --> 29:26.341
- l... I never saw...

29:26.473 --> 29:27.804
I never saw his face.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.173
- Exactly.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.015
- Nathan.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.472
You smell something?

29:43.156 --> 29:45.283
No, no, no, no!

29:45.409 --> 29:46.649
That's my mom!
That's my mother!

29:46.785 --> 29:47.945
- Wesley, hey.
You don't know that.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.739
- The bones...
The prosthetic leg.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.954
That's my mother!
- You can't do anything!

29:53.083 --> 29:54.448
You can't do anything.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.493
I'm sorry.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.996
- Wesley, you know the truth now.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.714
Aliens didn't take your mother.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.550
- But I promise you,
we're gonna find out who did.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.465
- They didn't keep my mother.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.553
- What are you talking about?

30:09.725 --> 30:12.512
- This is what they do with the bodies
they can't harvest.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.930
They burn them.
It's why there are so few real accounts.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.721
- No, Wesley, it's horrible what happened
to your mom, but this is not aliens.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.435
- My grandfather
showed me the photographs.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.770
- Wesley, do not do this!

30:24.072 --> 30:27.189
(loud noise)
- What the hell is that?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.068
- They're here.

30:53.602 --> 30:57.094
- Are you sure this plan
is gonna work, Wesley?

30:57.230 --> 30:58.766
- It was my grandfather's.

30:58.899 --> 31:03.233
It's a... it's pretty ancient,
so keep your fingers crossed.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.853
(feedback, sound waves)

31:09.743 --> 31:11.108
Old ironsides.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.233
Okay, okay.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.283
So if I can find it, I can...

31:15.415 --> 31:17.246
I can disrupt
their navigational frequency.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.866
- Which means what?

31:19.002 --> 31:21.118
- The mother ship might move
before releasing the blast.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.755
If only temporarily.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.212
- Possible this works?

31:24.341 --> 31:26.127
- It's his Trouble,
so he makes it possible.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.295
It's the "temporarily" part
ldonthke.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.293
- Okay, freak fighters,
what are we doing here?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.762
- We're working it out.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.131
Sure you're up to this?

31:34.267 --> 31:36.258
- He just saw his mother
burnt to a crisp.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.430
I think I can manage.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.607
Wesley.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.978
You've... you studied all of this
for years, haven't you?

31:48.115 --> 31:50.572
- Since I was a kid, yeah.
- Because you wanted to understand

31:50.700 --> 31:52.281
the truth of what happened
to your grandfather.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.276
- Which now I do.

31:54.413 --> 31:59.032
- And then these people show up
and tell you something completely different.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.666
And that's gotta be hard to hear, right?
- Because it isn't the truth.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.002
- Or maybe because it's scary.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.713
Maybe thinking that everything
that you thought you were,

32:06.842 --> 32:08.378
you really aren't.

32:27.529 --> 32:30.111
Wesley, the Troubles are real, all right?

32:30.282 --> 32:33.319
I've seen it before. You're doing this.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.951
- Okay, we need to do something right now.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.911
- We are doing something.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.624
If you want to take off, now's the time.
- I am not leaving.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.879
But it is like freaking
War of the worlds out there.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.337
If we don't act now,
we're all gonna die.

32:50.010 --> 32:53.047
- So what do you want to do?
Save us your way?

32:53.180 --> 32:55.216
Kill him?

32:55.348 --> 32:58.055
- Wesley, you're one of the lucky ones.
You can stop your Trouble.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.597
All you have to do
is open yourself up to the truth

33:00.729 --> 33:03.311
that none of this may really exist.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.977
- You can't just erase
what has been a part of my life,

33:06.151 --> 33:09.769
part of my family, since I was...
since I can remember.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.239
- Family.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.332
Wesley, your grandfather
disappeared in 1983?

33:24.503 --> 33:26.164
- Yeah.
- That was the last time

33:26.338 --> 33:30.081
the Troubles were here. Wesley's grandfather
probably had the same Trouble.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.753
- So?

33:31.885 --> 33:34.251
- So he made it through
without destroying the whole town.

33:34.387 --> 33:37.720
Maybe he decided to leave
to save the town.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.778
Your grandfather
couldn't make the aliens go away,

33:50.946 --> 33:55.280
but he realized maybe
he could finally learn the truth.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.530
- That's why he went with them.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.790
You think he's still up there?

34:15.762 --> 34:16.922
- Maybe.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.929
- Maybe he's waiting for me.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.213
(soft guitar music)

35:46.269 --> 35:48.646
- Hey, Nathan.

35:50.023 --> 35:52.264
Explain to me the difference
between killing a man

35:52.400 --> 35:55.312
and convincing him
to crawl up his own ass,

35:55.445 --> 35:58.107
because I'm at a loss.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.273
- Wesley chose to walk into that light.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.946
- Aw, come on,
you didn't nudge him a little?

36:04.079 --> 36:07.037
I mean, you said he was crazy.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.746
- Well, what did you say?

36:08.875 --> 36:10.831
"Why not aliens?"

36:12.504 --> 36:14.540
So maybe he's not dead.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.538
Maybe he comes back
after the Troubles are over

36:16.675 --> 36:18.336
with some good stories.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.211
- Whatever helps you sleep at night,
chief.

36:22.389 --> 36:23.925
- Actually the only thing
that bothers me

36:24.099 --> 36:26.340
is that you wanted to kill him
in the first place.

36:26.518 --> 36:30.477
- No, don't turn this around, Nathan.
- I saw it on your face, Duke.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.025
You can tell the world
that you're not like your father.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.108
When the chips are down,
you are what you are.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.533
- You're a hypocrite, Nathan.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.921
- ls Duke okay?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.551
- He's fine.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.632
Someone should be taking care of you
right now.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.992
- That guy knew that l was Lucy.

37:36.963 --> 37:40.706
He expected me to remember
things about her life,

37:40.842 --> 37:43.549
events and people...

37:45.096 --> 37:46.836
FeeHngs.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.556
He said that l...

37:54.397 --> 37:55.853
- That you what?

37:57.317 --> 38:00.309
- That I know...

38:00.487 --> 38:02.273
the Colorado Kid.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.824
And according to this guy,
he's still alive.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.030
Think about that.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.165
- I can't imagine
what you went through down there.

38:18.421 --> 38:23.256
I don't want you to let anything he said
turn you inside out.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.506
- Oh, Audrey.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.963
Thank God you're all right.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.516
If there's anything
I can do at all to help...

38:33.853 --> 38:38.062
- You can answer my questions. Or is that
gonna be a problem again for you two?

38:38.191 --> 38:40.603
- Parker.
- What do you want to know?

38:40.735 --> 38:43.602
- Guys, please.
Now is not the time, okay?

38:43.738 --> 38:46.980
- No, was Lucy Ripley
in love with the Colorado Kid?

38:47.158 --> 38:49.023
- We don't know.

38:49.202 --> 38:50.908
- l was abducted, l was tied up

38:51.037 --> 38:54.029
and beaten up by a man who knows me
better than I know myself.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.744
So don't just stand there
and act like you're clueless.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.413
No, Nathan, don't!

38:59.546 --> 39:01.377
Is the Colorado Kid still alive?

39:01.548 --> 39:03.129
- No.

39:04.217 --> 39:08.381
I helped bury him myself.
Plot 301 in Potter's field.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.265
- Let me take you home.

39:18.398 --> 39:21.731
- I need to see what's in that grave.
- Tomorrow, Parker.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.482
- I'm prepared to put our issues aside.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.280
The man who kidnapped Audrey
is out there,

39:33.413 --> 39:35.620
and we have to figure out who it is.

39:35.748 --> 39:37.830
- And how he knows so damn much.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.300
- Sure you know
what you're doing with that thing?

39:54.017 --> 39:55.473
- Protecting Audrey.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.635
- From Duke?
- If necessary.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.179
- Make sure you protect yourself too.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.973
The people with that mark...
they're not all good.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.738
- No, I'm not questioning
your forensic work, Frank.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.116
I'm simply asking
about the margin of error.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.329
Yeah, okay, but I was
literally talking to Roslyn

40:21.502 --> 40:23.003
an hour before we found her body.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.871
There is no way that she was
in that fire for four hours.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.957
Uh-huh, okay.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.386
Okay.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.645
Okay, well, can you just
check it again, please?

40:39.771 --> 40:42.387
Thank you. I gotta go.

41:03.586 --> 41:04.575
- What?

41:05.713 --> 41:08.125
- Somebody must have
moved the body.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.340
- Maybe there was
never a body to begin with.

41:15.515 --> 41:20.430
- Which means the Colorado Kid
could still be alive.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.182
- Oh, he's not alive.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.101
- Well, he's not here.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.606
- There's something else.

41:33.116 --> 41:35.482
"Find him before the Hunter."

41:35.618 --> 41:36.903
- Who's the Hunter?

41:38.287 --> 41:39.493
- And who the hell wrote it?

41:41.749 --> 41:42.955
- I did.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.416
That's my handwriting.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.582
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
