02:27.437 --> 02:29.147
When are you gonna
start over there ?

02:29.314 --> 02:32.525
We can't blast over there.
That's not our land yet.

02:32.692 --> 02:35.570
I thought we bought the
whole tract 15 months ago.

02:35.737 --> 02:38.948
No, we took an option on
Mrs. Warren's land over there.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.576
But that doesn't include the
center strip with the two farms.

02:49.334 --> 02:52.587
Henry, when we agreed to buy your
wife's land, you guaranteed...

02:52.712 --> 02:54.172
I know it, Mr. Elwell.

02:54.631 --> 02:57.508
We just been held up a bit
on account of both those farmer boys

02:57.675 --> 02:59.218
been off fighting a war.

02:59.844 --> 03:03.598
One's back already,
another one's due any day now.

03:03.765 --> 03:07.393
And I arranged to hear about it just
as soon as he sets foot off the bus.

03:07.769 --> 03:10.647
Why don't you talk to the other
one in the meantime ?

03:10.813 --> 03:12.482
I can't do that, Mr. Elwell.

03:12.649 --> 03:15.693
We have to give Rad McDowell
the first chance to sell out.

03:15.860 --> 03:18.196
- Why ?
- 'Cause he's white.

03:18.363 --> 03:20.740
The other place belongs to colored.

03:55.483 --> 03:57.610
Supposing neither
one of them wants to sell ?

03:57.777 --> 03:59.737
Don't you worry about that, Mr. Elwell.

04:00.321 --> 04:02.699
One of them places belongs
to a cousin of mine,

04:02.865 --> 04:05.368
and the other one to my wife's
old colored mammy and her son.

04:05.535 --> 04:09.455
So you see, in a manner of speaking,
it's all in the family.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.332
We can't wait forever, Henry.

04:11.499 --> 04:13.501
If the deal isn't wrapped up
by the end of the month,

04:13.668 --> 04:16.337
we'll just have to drop our
option on your wife's property

04:16.504 --> 04:18.089
and expand in the other direction.

04:18.255 --> 04:20.507
Here is my wife now, Julie.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.095
- How do you do ?
- Sheriff Coombs is been very helpful.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.222
- Mr. Elwell.
- Elwell.

04:26.389 --> 04:29.058
So nice meeting you
at last, Mrs. Warren.

04:29.183 --> 04:33.396
I'm glad to see it isn't just a legend
what they say about southern beauty.

04:33.521 --> 04:37.317
It's both a pleasure and a revelation
for me too, Mr. Elwell.

04:37.483 --> 04:39.736
You see, down here we're brought up
believing that all Yankees

04:39.861 --> 04:41.195
have horns and a tail.

04:41.321 --> 04:43.740
- Is that so ?
- Cross my heart.

04:43.865 --> 04:45.867
You know, I was 10 years old
before I learned that

04:45.992 --> 04:48.369
"damn" and "Yankee"
were two separate words.

04:50.913 --> 04:53.499
Now how about stopping by the house
for a nice, long drink ?

04:53.625 --> 04:58.046
I'd love to, but we've got three other
places to visit before we call it a day.

04:58.171 --> 04:59.339
- Good- bye.
- Good- bye.

04:59.464 --> 05:00.548
- Sheriff.
- Mr. Elwell.

05:00.673 --> 05:03.009
- Henry.
- Mr. Elwell.

06:16.374 --> 06:20.545
Hey, Rad ? Rad.
Over here.

06:22.714 --> 06:25.133
Let me be the first
to welcome you home.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.345
- Somebody meeting you ?
- No, I figured I'd surprise them.

06:29.512 --> 06:31.931
Get in, I'll run you home.

06:32.098 --> 06:35.101
Come on, you sure as hell
ain't gonna walk it.

06:52.035 --> 06:54.621
How's it look to you ?
It changed any ?

06:54.746 --> 06:57.749
Yes and no. It all seems smaller.

06:57.874 --> 07:02.211
Sure it does, now you've seen
them famous European cities and all.

07:02.337 --> 07:06.132
You'd never been more than
20 miles away before the war.

07:06.716 --> 07:09.177
Must've been pretty exciting, huh ?

07:09.344 --> 07:11.638
Depends on where
you're looking from.

07:11.804 --> 07:14.015
From over there or over here.

07:16.017 --> 07:18.519
You look good, Rad, real good.

07:19.062 --> 07:22.732
And you look prosperous, Cousin Henry.
Mighty prosperous.

07:22.899 --> 07:25.485
This ? Why this ain't even
the ribbon on the package.

07:25.652 --> 07:27.987
Can't hardly call it a beginning.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.406
Quicker than you can think about it,
we'll be going all the way

07:30.573 --> 07:32.200
from land poor to money rich.

07:32.325 --> 07:34.202
Sounds like a nice trip.

07:34.369 --> 07:37.497
- Did you hear about Riverside ?
- Lou wrote me some.

07:37.664 --> 07:40.500
It's already the biggest thing
ever to hit Colfax County.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.711
And before we're through, gonna be
the biggest thing to ever hit Georgia.

07:49.175 --> 07:53.054
Riverside.
To be completed in October.

07:53.429 --> 07:56.516
They made me the local manager.
I'm in charge of this whole district.

07:56.683 --> 07:59.018
A lot different than the old
days on the shrimp boats, huh ?

07:59.394 --> 08:01.771
I've seen to it you're gonna
get cut a piece of the pie, too.

08:01.938 --> 08:04.691
- What pie is that ?
- Why, the money-pie.

08:05.191 --> 08:08.111
Hell, boy, don't bother to thank me. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I was glad to do it.

08:08.403 --> 08:10.196
Maybe you and me
didn't always hit it off.

08:10.363 --> 08:12.824
But say what you will,
blood is thicker than water.

08:12.991 --> 08:15.410
So I'm making sure you get
took care of real good.

08:15.576 --> 08:16.577
Why '2

08:16.786 --> 08:19.747
Well, you think you're going to be happy
sinking back into the same old rut?

08:19.872 --> 08:23.876
Breaking your back trying to scratch
a living out that little farm of yours ?

08:24.043 --> 08:26.254
No, sir. You'll want more.

08:26.462 --> 08:30.508
For them kids of yours, too.
Especially for that Charles.

08:30.675 --> 08:34.846
He's a real go-getter! Spitting image
of me when I was his age.

08:35.013 --> 08:36.972
Seems more like my son
than my cousin.

08:37.140 --> 08:40.183
- Thanks.
- Anyways...

08:40.434 --> 08:43.187
I sold the powers that be
on the idea of buying your place

08:43.354 --> 08:46.232
for the exact same price
they paid for Julie's land.

08:46.399 --> 08:50.278
$100 an acre. Even for that parcel
that's no more than swampland.

08:50.445 --> 08:52.196
How 'bout that for horse trading ?

08:52.363 --> 08:55.158
- Well, I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know ?

08:55.325 --> 08:59.704
When else do you think you're gonna
get the chance to even see $5,000 ?

08:59.829 --> 09:04.208
Never, I reckon. But it ain't the kind
of thing you decide on just like that.

09:04.876 --> 09:07.003
- I'd have to think on it.
- You do that.

09:07.170 --> 09:09.589
Only don't go letting them
have second thoughts.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.077
I'd better be getting along, Rad,
I'm already late for church.

09:39.243 --> 09:42.330
You at church ?
Why, it ain't even Sunday.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.999
- Things have changed around here.
- No, not that much.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.669
It's just that Julie's cousin,
Clem, is getting ordained today.

09:47.877 --> 09:51.089
Gonna be the new minister.
Opportunity's knocking, Rad.

09:51.506 --> 09:53.675
Don't wait too long to answer
the door.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.343
I'll think on it.

10:37.844 --> 10:40.013
Hey, Lou '2

10:43.808 --> 10:45.810
Lou '2

10:55.069 --> 10:56.863
Lou '2

11:05.788 --> 11:11.127
- Something's ailing you, Reeve.
- No, Mama.

11:11.502 --> 11:14.922
Well, something happened
to change your mood since breakfast.

11:15.089 --> 11:19.093
You better than any of that radar
they had out in the South Pacific.

11:19.427 --> 11:21.638
I don't know nothing about radar,

11:21.804 --> 11:24.599
but I know when something's
plaguing my child.

11:24.766 --> 11:26.726
Rad McDowell done come back.

11:26.893 --> 11:29.145
I seen him down by the road,
talking with his cousin.

11:29.312 --> 11:30.438
Henry Warren ?

11:30.605 --> 11:34.317
I bet he's after Rad to sell his place,
just like he been nagging us.

11:34.442 --> 11:38.071
Why don't you go over there ?
Ask Rad about it.

11:38.279 --> 11:40.114
The two of you
have always been friendly.

11:40.448 --> 11:43.618
- When we was kids, maybe, not since.
- Suit yourself.

11:43.785 --> 11:47.580
But soon as I'm up and about,
I'm gonna pay me a call on Miss Julie.

11:48.373 --> 11:50.917
She'll know how to handle
Mr. Henry Warren.

11:51.084 --> 11:54.379
The wife always knows the best
ways to get around her man.

11:54.545 --> 11:56.422
Mama, you living in a dream.

11:56.714 --> 11:59.592
You can't trust no Miss Julie or
no other white folks to watch out for us.

11:59.759 --> 12:01.886
We gotta start watching out
for ourselves.

12:02.053 --> 12:05.431
I don't know what they done
to you in that there army.

12:05.932 --> 12:10.687
Seems like you ain't got a kind word
to say about nobody since you got back.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.899
You go away, you get to take
a good long look at yourself.

12:15.066 --> 12:16.734
Your life, everything.

12:17.235 --> 12:20.113
It ain't so easy, after that,
to fall back into old ways.

12:29.205 --> 12:32.333
- How you been, Mr. Warren ?
- Fine, thank you, Deputy.

12:33.710 --> 12:35.586
Can't be all over
and done with already.

12:35.753 --> 12:38.089
Can it, Judge ?

13:14.083 --> 13:15.668
Excuse me.

13:31.184 --> 13:33.853
Rad ! Rad !

13:38.942 --> 13:41.194
I'd like to have died
when I heard in town

13:41.319 --> 13:43.279
that you was back,
and us not here to greet you.

13:43.529 --> 13:45.239
Don't fret, honey, don't fret.

13:45.365 --> 13:47.367
Honey, when we didn't hear
nothing this morning,

13:47.492 --> 13:48.952
we figured you wasn't coming today.

13:49.118 --> 13:52.246
I went into town to the beauty parlor,
so as I'd look pretty for you.

13:52.413 --> 13:54.707
You are the prettiest
sight I ever did see.

13:54.832 --> 13:56.584
I never even got to the beauty parlor.

13:56.709 --> 13:59.671
It don't matter, honey.
It don't matter one bit.

14:02.715 --> 14:04.008
Come here !

14:06.135 --> 14:07.387
I'm home.

14:07.887 --> 14:12.475
Great God Almighty,
I'm really home.

14:30.326 --> 14:32.662
If you hadn't invited
the negress to attend,

14:32.787 --> 14:34.372
the whole incident
could have been avoided.

14:34.497 --> 14:37.959
I couldn't very well refuse to
give her communion, could I?

14:38.084 --> 14:41.254
Until you get them a pastor of
their own, I'm their priest, too.

14:41.462 --> 14:45.008
If God in his wisdom saw
fit to separate the races,

14:45.133 --> 14:47.010
who are we to question him ?

14:47.552 --> 14:52.849
Clem, I think you ought to work out
some means of mollifying Judge Purcell.

14:53.141 --> 14:54.434
It doesn't do to start out in the ministry

14:54.559 --> 14:57.604
with one of your most important
parishioners at odds with you.

14:57.729 --> 15:00.815
There's a lot more to it, Bishop.
After that woman received,

15:00.940 --> 15:03.151
I passed the communion cup
to the Judge.

15:03.276 --> 15:04.861
He spit into it.

15:04.986 --> 15:07.113
I was standing right there,
and I didn't see it.

15:07.238 --> 15:08.906
It happened.

15:09.198 --> 15:13.870
If I was you, Clem,
I wouldn't challenge the Judge on it.

15:13.995 --> 15:17.373
Let him just come around
to you in his own good time.

15:17.498 --> 15:21.169
Otherwise, he might just say he didn't
do it. Then where would you be ?

15:21.252 --> 15:25.256
In almost as awkward a position as I'll
be if he expects to receive communion

15:25.381 --> 15:27.091
without asking forgiveness.

15:28.217 --> 15:31.012
- Come in.
- Clem, it was just lovely.

15:31.137 --> 15:34.599
- Thank you, Julie.
- And terribly impressive.

15:34.724 --> 15:36.893
I feel like I should start
calling you Mr. De Lavery.

15:37.018 --> 15:42.065
I'm the same man I always was.
Whatever that's worth.

16:06.673 --> 16:09.008
Morning, miss.

16:09.676 --> 16:12.929
Yeah ! Run down that hen !

16:13.054 --> 16:14.889
Giddy-up ! Yeah !

16:16.474 --> 16:19.352
All right, Charles, supper's ready,
get to the table.

16:24.148 --> 16:26.484
Come on.

16:30.655 --> 16:34.826
Charles. Charles.

16:43.751 --> 16:46.546
Lord, we thank thee for all thy bounty.

16:46.671 --> 16:51.509
And most especially, for bringing us
together again safe and sound. Amen.

16:56.139 --> 16:58.349
Excuse me,
I'd like to talk to the Sheriff.

16:58.474 --> 17:00.351
- Bishop.
- Delighted to see you again, Judge.

17:00.476 --> 17:02.937
- Thank you kindly.
- You too, Miss Purcell.

17:03.062 --> 17:08.192
The pleasure's mine, Bishop.
And this here's our daughter, Sukie.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.569
Judge, it looks like you're
simply surrounded by beauty.

17:10.694 --> 17:12.155
Thank you.

17:14.073 --> 17:17.492
Mrs. Coombs, you are
a sight for sore eyes.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.997
Sheriff, you're a good boy,
always a good boy.

17:21.122 --> 17:22.874
Yes.

17:23.124 --> 17:25.917
Miss Julie,
it's a pleasure to see you.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.171
- Hello, Julie.
- Mrs. Purcell.

17:28.296 --> 17:30.715
I'm so glad you all could
come to greet my cousin, Clem.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.050
Oh, no.

17:32.383 --> 17:34.552
Just a second, Sukie,
I want you to meet the guest of honor.

17:34.677 --> 17:37.347
Well, I was just fixing
to get a glass of punch.

17:37.472 --> 17:38.848
All in good time, sugar.

17:38.973 --> 17:41.643
Clem, there's some folks over
here you haven't met yet.

17:41.768 --> 17:45.897
- Miss Julie, if you'll excuse us.
- Why, Judge, I wouldn't think of it.

17:46.022 --> 17:50.818
But you saw how we was insulted,
me and my womenfolk, by this...

17:50.944 --> 17:54.155
- This hot-headed cousin of yours.
- Well, what was it he did ?

17:54.280 --> 17:55.949
Well, I'll tell you what he did.

17:56.074 --> 17:59.494
He passed me a cup which had just
been pressed to the mouth

17:59.619 --> 18:01.079
of an old nigger woman.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.164
Now I ask you how you'd feel

18:03.289 --> 18:06.084
if someone was to do a thing
like that to you, Miss Julie.

18:06.209 --> 18:09.796
Well, seeing as how I was breast-fed
by a colored wet nurse,

18:09.921 --> 18:12.256
one of the finest women
ever wore shoe leather,

18:12.382 --> 18:13.967
I think I'd manage to survive.

18:14.092 --> 18:16.552
This wasn't anything like that, no, sir.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.681
Let me tell you, this was
nothing less than the leavings

18:19.806 --> 18:22.517
of a drunken, syphilitic,
old nigger woman.

18:22.767 --> 18:24.519
I can't rightly blame her.

18:24.644 --> 18:27.897
No, she's obviously too far gone
to know what she's doing.

18:28.022 --> 18:31.985
But I can, and I do,
blame the man who had the audacity

18:32.110 --> 18:34.320
to pass that very same cup on to me.

18:34.445 --> 18:36.531
Judge, do you know this woman ?

18:37.323 --> 18:39.117
- Do you know her?
- Well, not by name.

18:39.242 --> 18:43.037
Then how come you're so sure
she's drunken and syphilitic and all?

18:43.162 --> 18:46.374
Unless, of course, you are specially
qualified in those fields.

18:46.499 --> 18:48.418
We are leaving.

18:49.460 --> 18:52.422
Judge, she don't know
what she's saying.

18:52.547 --> 18:56.009
Well, I know what I'm saying.
And I'll tell you right here and now,

18:56.134 --> 19:00.054
no member of my family will
ever set foot in St. Paul's

19:00.179 --> 19:02.056
as long as that man is pastor.

19:02.181 --> 19:06.436
- Papa, what about my wedding ?
- There are other churches.

19:06.561 --> 19:10.773
Don't you worry your pretty little head,
Sukie. Come on.

19:10.940 --> 19:12.984
Cousin Henry says the real smart men

19:13.109 --> 19:15.862
was the ones who managed
to stay out of the army.

19:15.987 --> 19:18.823
That's something Cousin Henry
knows a lot about.

19:18.948 --> 19:21.618
He says with four kids and all,
you didn't have to go, neither.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.661
Is that so, Daddy ?

19:23.786 --> 19:26.456
A man's got to do
what his conscience says is right.

19:26.581 --> 19:29.000
Cousin Henry didn't
feel like he ought to go.

19:29.125 --> 19:33.463
And he's only got one kid.
How come is that ?

19:35.298 --> 19:40.136
It just might be that Cousin Henry
don't know what a conscience is, son.

19:42.972 --> 19:45.141
I'm glad that's over with.

19:45.266 --> 19:48.645
Thought you might feel
the need of a little restorative.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.439
I thought it went pretty well,
all things considered.

19:51.564 --> 19:54.108
- That so ?
- Meaning ?

19:54.317 --> 19:58.780
Well, if I was you, I'd make mighty
sure I didn't go through no red lights

19:58.947 --> 20:01.282
or get me any parking tickets.

20:01.449 --> 20:04.786
Leastways, not for
the next couple of years.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.163
He came here,
to my home and my party,

20:07.330 --> 20:10.750
with the sole purpose of
insulting my guest of honor.

20:10.917 --> 20:15.880
My own kin.
I think he got just what he deserved.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.884
There's my angel.

20:20.885 --> 20:23.513
- There's my lamb.
- It ain't my fault, Mr. Warren.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.016
- He just wouldn't stay in his room.
- Course he wouldn't, why should he ?

20:27.183 --> 20:31.479
You've been just as good as gold all
afternoon. Haven't you, precious ?

20:33.690 --> 20:37.485
You don't want Mama to carry you ?
Okay. There you go, sweetheart.

20:42.448 --> 20:47.036
Come on, honey.
Stop, Colie, come on, sweetheart.

20:47.203 --> 20:51.040
Stop it. Sugar.

20:51.874 --> 20:54.210
Sugar, I told you, that's a no-no.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.384
Give me that !

21:02.510 --> 21:04.345
Come on, honey.

21:06.055 --> 21:08.057
What did you have to do that for ?

21:10.101 --> 21:13.313
You know he can't stand
to be yelled at.

21:15.815 --> 21:17.483
Now, sugar.

21:17.942 --> 21:19.402
Kissie.

21:19.527 --> 21:22.488
Can you take Colie up ?
It's way past his bedtime.

21:24.907 --> 21:27.243
- No.
- It's all right, sweetheart.

21:47.847 --> 21:49.557
I'm sorry.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.689
I guess we're all a bit over-tired.

22:06.574 --> 22:09.243
I'm glad we got this minute
to ourselves.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.749
There's something I've been wanting
to talk over with you all day.

22:14.832 --> 22:17.293
Riverside ?

22:18.002 --> 22:20.797
Rad McDowell come home
this morning.

22:23.007 --> 22:24.884
Julie.

22:27.095 --> 22:30.431
He didn't jump at the idea of selling
like I thought he would.

22:30.556 --> 22:34.727
Lord Almighty, but I'm sick
of hearing about Riverside.

22:34.852 --> 22:38.564
Seems like that's all anybody
has ever talked to me about.

22:39.774 --> 22:43.111
First my mama and daddy
and now you.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.863
That land is all we got.

22:46.155 --> 22:50.535
When I think I once looked upon you
as a way out of Riverside and all.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.037
I can be, honey. I will.

22:53.496 --> 22:56.624
Only, right now, we walking on eggs.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.752
Until we get Rad and Rose to sell.

22:59.961 --> 23:03.298
Henry, I'm not going out
there and worry Aunt Rose.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.383
Now I thought I made
that more than clear.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.594
You ain't gonna be worrying her.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.847
You're gonna be showing her the pot
of gold at the end of the rainbow.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.640
Henry.

23:14.183 --> 23:16.519
That old woman was my mammy.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.982
And she loved me.

23:21.899 --> 23:25.445
There was a time when she was
the only one in this whole world

23:25.612 --> 23:28.281
I knew really loved me.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.575
And I can't go against her.

23:31.409 --> 23:34.704
I just... I can't.

23:34.787 --> 23:37.123
All right, all right.

23:37.832 --> 23:41.419
If that's the way you feel,
ain't no sense harping on it.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.576
You do understand,
don't you, Henry ?

24:13.785 --> 24:15.578
Sure I do, sugar.

24:24.504 --> 24:30.635
What I don't understand is you setting
that old darkie and her few little acres

24:30.760 --> 24:32.679
against me and your son.

25:07.046 --> 25:09.841
- Did she awaken ?
- Didn't budge.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.634
She's gonna holler blue murder
in the morning

25:11.801 --> 25:14.137
when she finds out she ain't
bunking in with me no more.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.681
Well, a husband's
got to have some rights.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.058
It was mighty nice of you, Rad.

25:19.350 --> 25:22.103
Holding your tongue at supper
with Charles, I mean.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.856
I know it wasn't easy for you.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.776
I figured I'd try it your way.
For a spell, anyways.

25:29.110 --> 25:32.572
Only, I don't aim to let him
keep hanging around Cousin Henry.

25:32.739 --> 25:35.992
I think Henry has a real affection
for him.

25:36.534 --> 25:39.078
I think he wishes
Charles was his own boy.

25:39.245 --> 25:41.789
He's got a kid of his own.
What's he want with Charles ?

25:41.956 --> 25:43.583
Colie ain't normal.

25:43.750 --> 25:47.420
He's nearly six years old and
he can't say a solitary word.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.881
Folks say Henry is to blame for that.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.966
That kind of thing
ain't nobody's fault.

25:52.133 --> 25:55.345
Maybe, maybe not.
All I know is what folks say.

25:55.511 --> 25:58.723
- What's that ?
- Nearly four years ago...

25:58.890 --> 26:01.684
Didn't I write you about that ?
When Julie's daddy was dying,

26:01.851 --> 26:04.395
and she had to go up to the
hospital in Atlanta with him,

26:04.562 --> 26:07.398
there wasn't anybody to stay
with little Colie except for Henry.

26:07.565 --> 26:11.069
This was just about the time the whole
Riverside thing was getting started.

26:11.819 --> 26:16.240
Henry was always running after them,
trying to make a deal for Julie's land.

26:16.407 --> 26:18.159
Then, this day I'm talking about,

26:18.326 --> 26:21.120
some of the top men come down
from Atlanta and New York.

26:21.287 --> 26:24.499
Well, Henry wasn't about
to miss out on that.

26:24.666 --> 26:28.753
The thing was, though, he couldn't find
anybody to stay with little Colie.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.880
Although they say he did try.

26:31.256 --> 26:35.343
Anyhow, I guess he figured on
only being gone an hour or two.

26:35.885 --> 26:42.767
So he took a length of clothesline
and just tied that little feller into his crib.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.520
- Jesus.
- That ain't the half of it.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.565
Instead of being an hour or two,
he was gone for almost the whole day.

26:50.566 --> 26:54.362
And that child's been
peculiar ever since.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.657
- What did Julie say ?
- I don't know.

26:57.824 --> 27:01.577
I hear she don't admit
anything's wrong with the boy.

28:55.733 --> 29:00.154
Certain things are just
better left to experts.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.444
It's Colie.

29:40.987 --> 29:44.157
- I better tend to him.
- Kissie's up there with him.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.702
It'll be done faster
than we can talk about.

30:15.438 --> 30:20.151
You just hold on now, Rad.
You wanna burn the place down ?

30:21.110 --> 30:26.240
Lou, you can stall all you want to.
Only, I'm gonna be right here waiting.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.747
Darling, what's the matter?

30:32.997 --> 30:37.001
Did I say something ?
Or do something ?

30:37.877 --> 30:40.421
What? What's eating you ?

30:42.090 --> 30:44.425
Here I had it all pictured,

30:44.592 --> 30:47.178
how it was gonna be
when you come home.

30:47.345 --> 30:51.266
Me with a beauty parlor wave
and all gussied up to kill.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.227
I even had it in mind to buy
some brand-new sheets.

30:54.394 --> 30:59.232
You done dropped out of the blue,
and nothing's the way I planned it.

30:59.732 --> 31:03.653
Honey, I wouldn't change a bit of it.

31:10.743 --> 31:16.791
I look like I'm still working
as a welder. I do.

31:17.166 --> 31:20.837
Wait. Maybe I can help you out there.

31:27.844 --> 31:31.889
I brung you this,
all the way from Paris, France.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.267
Well, I never...

31:35.977 --> 31:41.899
- But... ls it all right ?
- Like it was made for you.

31:42.442 --> 31:46.154
I never had anything
so pretty in all my born days.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.698
That oughtn't to be, Lou.

31:48.906 --> 31:51.200
We're still young, both of us.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.995
Now's the time we ought to be
enjoying ourselves.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.123
Getting out and doing things,
all of us.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.667
There's got to be more to life

31:59.834 --> 32:02.045
than just working a farm till you drop
in your tracks.

32:02.211 --> 32:05.798
- Else nothing makes no sense.
- What's biting you, Rad ?

32:06.257 --> 32:09.385
I don't know.
Seems like I got me a fever.

32:09.552 --> 32:12.597
A yen to go places
while there's still time.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.475
- What places ?
- Lots of places.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.103
We got us a whole world
to choose from.

32:19.395 --> 32:23.441
I knowed it. I felt it all along.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.445
- You ain't glad to be back.
- Glad ?

32:27.862 --> 32:29.489
Well, that don't half describe it.

32:29.948 --> 32:34.327
Where are we gonna be while you're
hightailing it off to them places ?

32:34.494 --> 32:36.329
Right there with me, Lou.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.082
We can get us a trailer until we
settle on someplace permanent.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.708
No.

32:42.293 --> 32:47.006
Rad McDowell, you think I done broke
my nails and stooped my back,

32:47.173 --> 32:49.133
working day and night
keeping up this place,

32:49.300 --> 32:53.221
raising them kids in there,
plus doing a full day's work at the plant

32:53.388 --> 32:55.473
just so as you could
sashay back here and sell it?

32:55.640 --> 32:58.518
- Honey, if we got...
- We got this land, Rad.

32:58.685 --> 33:04.941
Well, that's more than a start.
It's all ours now, paid up free and clear.

33:05.108 --> 33:09.570
Land lasts. You take care of it,
it'll take care of you.

33:11.447 --> 33:16.202
Besides, you ask around.
Things is changed.

33:16.369 --> 33:19.372
They gonna be changing a lot more,
too, before they're finished.

33:19.539 --> 33:24.168
It could be that this place is gonna
be worth a lot more than $5,000.

33:24.335 --> 33:28.423
Now, do you think Henry Warren
is studying how to do us a good turn ?

33:28.756 --> 33:33.553
Okay, Lou, I won't go doing nothing
unless you agree with it.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.054
Deal ?

33:38.349 --> 33:40.893
Now, you put this damn thing on,
will you ?

34:24.520 --> 34:26.648
You're the only one, Lou.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.775
The only one in the whole wide
world for me.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.530
I ain't gonna ask you
no questions, Rad.

34:34.656 --> 34:39.409
I just want you to know,
there ain't never been nobody else.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.706
Darling, I... Look.

34:43.831 --> 34:47.126
There was times when
I'd get to feeling so low,

34:47.252 --> 34:50.170
and I had started walking
through some city,

34:50.295 --> 34:51.589
and meet some gal,
and we'd start talking...

34:51.714 --> 34:54.007
I don't want to hear about it.

34:54.132 --> 34:57.053
Not now, not ever.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.764
One thing you got to hear.

34:59.889 --> 35:04.477
There ain't nobody nowhere
meant a thing to me.

35:04.602 --> 35:10.400
It ain't never been good for me except
with you, Lou. I mean that.

35:15.029 --> 35:19.492
You recollect that motto
on my grandma's sampler?

35:22.495 --> 35:25.832
It said, "Actions speak louder
than words."

35:38.553 --> 35:40.597
Rad...

35:40.763 --> 35:42.473
I missed you so.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.288
Just two minutes.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.628
Hotter than a two-dollar pistol,
ain't ya ?

36:53.753 --> 36:55.505
Henry.

37:00.009 --> 37:03.596
What do we pay Kissie for
if she can't keep him quiet?

37:09.602 --> 37:12.772
Henry, when he gets like this,
I'm the only one he'll...

37:12.897 --> 37:15.400
Come on, Henry, let go.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.694
Henry, let go.

37:17.819 --> 37:21.531
- Let go !
- What about me ?

37:21.656 --> 37:24.033
If it weren't for you,
he might not be crying.

37:24.534 --> 37:29.455
I'm through letting you wish
it all off on me. You hear?

37:29.580 --> 37:33.501
Ain't never been nothing like
that on my side of the family.

37:33.626 --> 37:37.088
You just take a look at Rad's kids.
Any one of them.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.716
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
and smart as whips.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.427
Are you through ?

37:44.178 --> 37:47.432
Just don't think I'm gonna sit here like
some piece of machinery

37:47.557 --> 37:49.976
waiting for you to come back
and turn me on, you hear?

38:44.155 --> 38:45.239
Henry.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.123
Henry.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.588
There's Reeve Scott, Daddy.

40:23.713 --> 40:25.840
Hi, Rad.
Can you give me a lift into town ?

40:25.965 --> 40:27.550
Sure.

40:38.561 --> 40:42.732
- How's it feel to be home ?
- Okay, I guess.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.525
You selling out
to your Cousin Henry ?

40:44.692 --> 40:46.527
What's it to you ?

40:46.653 --> 40:49.113
He's playing us off against each other.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.908
You sellout, he cuts me off
from the river.

40:52.033 --> 40:55.453
I sell out,
he cuts you off from the road.

40:55.578 --> 40:58.122
- There's another thing.
- Yeah ?

40:58.247 --> 41:00.750
Ain't no sense in staying on
here unless we can make it pay.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.377
That's for sure.

41:02.502 --> 41:05.046
I figure we must lose a third
of what we plant each year

41:05.171 --> 41:07.757
on account of flooding or dry spells.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.968
At least.

41:10.093 --> 41:13.471
Why can't we blast out irrigation
ditches and keep our whole crop ?

41:13.596 --> 41:15.348
That's what Riverside's done.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.893
Riverside's geared for that.
We ain't.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.271
Know what they trained me
for in the army ?

41:21.396 --> 41:23.898
Demolition work.
Hell, man, I blasted roads

41:24.023 --> 41:26.484
through mountains and turned
jungles into airfields.

41:26.609 --> 41:30.405
- What's a little ditching after that ?
- You go ahead on and do it then.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.073
Are you kidding ?

41:32.198 --> 41:36.786
Ain't a storekeeper in all of Georgia
would sell me as much as a firecracker.

41:40.582 --> 41:45.336
Suppose we team up,
you do the buying, I'll do the blasting.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.922
- I'll think on it.
- We ain't got much time.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.341
We ought to have them dug
before we start planting.

41:50.466 --> 41:54.512
- I said I'd think on it.
- Well, what's there to think about?

41:55.346 --> 41:57.390
Afraid of what folks might say ?

41:57.515 --> 41:59.559
- No.
- Sure.

41:59.684 --> 42:04.647
- Look, I said no, didn't I ?
- Sorry, I didn't mean to push you.

42:04.772 --> 42:08.318
My wife and kids got to live
in this town.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.322
You better let me off here.
I don't want to embarrass you none

42:12.447 --> 42:15.450
by having folks see you
riding me through town.

42:26.336 --> 42:27.795
It just goes to show you,

42:27.921 --> 42:31.466
you can't be nice to a nigger,
else he takes advantage.

42:31.591 --> 42:34.385
I don't like that kind of talk,
Charles.

42:34.510 --> 42:38.973
But them things Reeve said, they don't
mean we ain't moving to California.

42:39.098 --> 42:42.894
California ?
Now, whatever gave you that idea ?

42:43.019 --> 42:46.564
It's just something
Cousin Henry said.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.942
Well, the next time Cousin Henry
comes snooping around,

42:49.067 --> 42:52.612
you just tell him to keep his nose out
of our affairs, you hear?

43:31.734 --> 43:35.655
Well, Vivian, I didn't know
you were back.

43:37.282 --> 43:38.866
I didn't know you were.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.997
If I come back to school,
can I have you for my teacher?

43:44.122 --> 43:47.333
Sure, if you could make it
into fourth grade.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.295
Forget the whole thing.

43:50.461 --> 43:54.048
- I'm looking for your grandpa.
- He'll be back in a minute.

43:56.884 --> 44:00.555
- How's your mother, Reeve ?
- She's pretty sick.

44:00.722 --> 44:03.016
I'm sorry to hear that.

44:03.141 --> 44:06.644
- When you get to be her age...
- How old do you think she is ?

44:06.769 --> 44:09.022
Maybe 72, 73.

44:09.147 --> 44:12.525
She's gonna be 54,
her next birthday.

44:12.650 --> 44:16.738
With the way she's been feeling lately,
I don't think she's gonna make it.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.116
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without her.

44:20.241 --> 44:23.453
Survive.
People can survive anything.

44:23.578 --> 44:27.665
Isn't that awful hard, Vivian ? ls that
what living in New York does to folk ?

44:27.832 --> 44:32.378
That's what living does to folks.
New York or anyplace else.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.881
Reeve, why didn't you ever
answer any of my letters ?

44:35.506 --> 44:37.467
All during the war I wondered about you.

44:37.592 --> 44:41.471
What was the use ? You wrote me
you'd fallen for some guy in New York.

44:41.596 --> 44:42.847
Why, Reeve.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.683
- Good to see you, son.
- Hi there, Professor.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.771
Maybe you can help me talk
some sense into Vivian here.

44:49.938 --> 44:55.193
This innocent, old country teacher
could outsmart any con man in Harlem.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.363
- Is that so ?
- I came home for a short visit...

44:58.529 --> 45:01.157
And the next thing I knew,
he had me teaching school again.

45:01.282 --> 45:03.368
And now he's asking me
to sign up for next year.

45:03.534 --> 45:06.120
This is your home,
this is where you belong.

45:06.287 --> 45:08.414
You never got sick
when you were living here.

45:08.539 --> 45:12.043
I wasn't sick in New York.
I just needed a change.

45:13.211 --> 45:16.047
But I can't see myself spending
the rest of my life here.

45:17.215 --> 45:21.135
Somehow, Georgia isn't my idea
of the promised land.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.763
- You talk to her, Reeve.
- Why me ?

45:23.888 --> 45:26.099
Because she has answers
to all of my arguments.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.142
Well, then I don't see how
I can be a match for her.

45:28.476 --> 45:33.147
- Giving up without a fight ?
- I figured that's what you're doing.

45:33.314 --> 45:36.526
I mean, just saying how tough things
are down here ain't gonna cure them.

45:36.651 --> 45:40.530
If we want it better, we gotta make it
better. Nobody's gonna do it for us.

45:40.655 --> 45:44.742
That's sort of what they had to do in
the original promised land, wasn't it?

45:44.909 --> 45:46.536
He's got you there, Vivian.

45:46.703 --> 45:50.081
Anyway, what I came to see you about,
Professor, was to ask your advice.

45:50.248 --> 45:53.334
Henry Warren's been after my mama
to sell our place to Riverside.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.587
We don't aim to sell.

45:55.670 --> 45:57.880
This here's the original bill
of sale my great-grandpa,

45:58.047 --> 46:01.634
Old Jonas B., got when he
bought our place at auction.

46:01.843 --> 46:06.139
Have you checked to see if there's a
copy of this on file in the courthouse ?

46:06.264 --> 46:10.602
- You know they wouldn't let me.
- It's dated 1866.

46:11.436 --> 46:16.566
Maybe the file copy got lost when
the old courthouse burned down in '76.

46:16.691 --> 46:19.152
If it did, this is the only copy.

46:19.277 --> 46:21.362
Would you mind if
I kept this in my safe ?

46:21.487 --> 46:25.658
You must be reading my mind !
You think I ought to look for a lawyer ?

46:25.783 --> 46:27.660
That would take some doing.

46:31.915 --> 46:36.419
- I'd like to see you again.
- I don't think we ought to, Reeve.

46:36.544 --> 46:40.381
- Why not?
- It wouldn't be fair to you.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.551
I'm not even sure
it would be fair to me.

46:45.929 --> 46:47.805
Well, you're the teacher.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.503
- Hello, Mr. Warren.
- Hi there, Ada.

47:18.628 --> 47:20.755
- Why, Henry Warren.
- Eula.

47:22.173 --> 47:25.009
Vernon is out tending to his roses.

47:25.134 --> 47:28.429
Don't you forget to say hello
to Sukie before you leave.

47:28.554 --> 47:29.639
I won't.

47:30.056 --> 47:32.725
- Judge.
- Henry ?

47:32.850 --> 47:36.020
I just come by to apologize
for that little to-do over at my place.

47:36.145 --> 47:40.233
You don't owe me any apology, Henry.
It's others in your family that do.

47:40.358 --> 47:43.403
Papa, have you forgotten you're
driving me to Nancy Doakes'

47:43.528 --> 47:45.113
for the shower they're giving me ?

47:45.238 --> 47:48.700
- I can take her, Judge, if you like.
- You're an angel, Henry.

47:48.825 --> 47:50.910
- Is Julie going ?
- No, she ain't.

47:51.035 --> 47:54.539
Guess she's afraid you'd outshine her,
you pretty thing, you.

47:54.664 --> 47:56.958
See, first she insults me,
then my daughter.

47:57.083 --> 48:00.378
It don't seem to me to be such
a great burden for her to attend

48:00.503 --> 48:02.922
a little shindig in Sukie's honor.

48:03.047 --> 48:05.008
Well, it's our boy, Judge,
he ain't too well today.

48:05.133 --> 48:10.763
I think that your son's ailment
is mighty convenient for Julie Ann.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.766
- That ain't like you, Judge.
- Well, look at the facts, man.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.060
It keeps her from being
Sukie's matron of honor,

48:16.185 --> 48:18.688
or attending any of our little festivities.

48:18.813 --> 48:21.482
But it don't stop her from
giving parties and what all

48:21.608 --> 48:23.610
for that nigger-loving cousin of hers.

48:23.735 --> 48:26.904
Well, you see, Judge,
it ain't just our boy.

48:27.030 --> 48:28.114
I thought as much.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.491
Now, on top of him,
she's all upset these days

48:30.617 --> 48:32.994
on account of the trouble we've
been having with Rose Scott.

48:33.661 --> 48:36.456
- With who ?
- Rose Scott, her old colored mammy.

48:36.581 --> 48:39.459
She's a mighty sick old nigger,

48:39.584 --> 48:42.879
and my Julie, she takes
these things pretty bad.

48:43.004 --> 48:46.466
Then, too, there's all this
foolishness over her land.

48:46.591 --> 48:50.011
- What land ?
- The land that she... Rose lives on.

48:50.136 --> 48:52.889
It's Colfax land,
everybody knows that.

48:53.014 --> 48:56.851
Only Julie's family let
old Rose live there free and clear.

48:56.976 --> 48:59.062
As long as she kept up the taxes.

48:59.187 --> 49:02.190
Now, with Rose fixing to die,

49:02.315 --> 49:04.776
Julie would like her to
sell the land to Riverside.

49:04.901 --> 49:06.569
For how much ?

49:06.694 --> 49:09.781
I guess they might go
as high as 2,000.

49:09.906 --> 49:14.285
High enough for the estate to pass
through my court for probate.

49:14.410 --> 49:17.705
Yeah, come to think of it,
I guess that it will.

49:17.830 --> 49:21.292
Then, with any kind of a
title dispute in question,

49:21.417 --> 49:23.962
you know better than
to come to my house,

49:24.087 --> 49:26.130
trying to prejudice my judgment.

49:26.256 --> 49:30.301
I may not have the same glorious family
tree as your high and mighty wife,

49:30.426 --> 49:34.597
but one thing I do pride myself on,
and that is my integrity.

49:34.722 --> 49:36.391
I'm truly sorry, Judge.

49:36.516 --> 49:39.018
I'd never have brought it up if
I thought you'd take offense.

49:39.143 --> 49:42.230
Now, when this old nigger woman dies...
What'd you say her name was ?

49:42.355 --> 49:44.232
- Rose Scott.
- Yeah, Rose Scott.

49:44.315 --> 49:48.736
When she dies,
if her kinfolk can prove title,

49:48.861 --> 49:51.447
and I very much doubt that they can...

49:51.572 --> 49:55.743
You have no idea what
I have to put up against.

49:55.868 --> 49:58.288
No, these darkies
never have any papers,

49:58.413 --> 50:02.625
no birth certificates,
no deeds, no wills, nothing.

50:02.750 --> 50:06.254
Anyway, if they can prove title,
there's nothing I can do about it.

50:06.379 --> 50:08.423
But if they can't...

50:08.548 --> 50:13.678
Henry, my little Sukie
has got her heart set on

50:13.803 --> 50:16.472
having Julie Ann
as her matron of honor.

50:16.598 --> 50:18.099
Yes, I do know that, Judge.

50:18.224 --> 50:21.311
And I got my heart set on
giving her whatever she wants.

50:21.436 --> 50:24.606
Yeah, but with you moving the
wedding off to Bay City...

50:24.731 --> 50:27.066
Julie sets a lot by her cousin, Clem.

50:27.191 --> 50:29.277
Well, that's your problem,
isn't it, Henry ?

50:29.402 --> 50:31.904
So, let's see what
you can do about it, huh ?

50:32.030 --> 50:35.116
- I'll do my best, Judge.
- Do more than that, Henry.

50:35.241 --> 50:36.576
Do more than what?

50:36.701 --> 50:39.078
Just a little wedding
present for you, dear.

50:39.203 --> 50:41.122
Something Henry's going
to arrange.

50:41.247 --> 50:44.834
I'll see if I can't get it out of him
on the way to the shower.

50:45.668 --> 50:47.670
- Bye- bye, Papa.
- Bye, dear.

50:47.795 --> 50:49.839
- You have a good time.
- I'll try.

50:49.964 --> 50:51.424
Yes, sir.

50:56.095 --> 50:59.140
Seems like old times,
riding off with you, Henry.

50:59.265 --> 51:02.185
- You want somebody to hear?
- They wouldn't believe it, darling.

51:02.310 --> 51:04.270
I hardly do myself.

51:12.987 --> 51:17.158
Let me, Henry. Been too long a time
since I started your motor.

51:17.283 --> 51:20.245
Boy, you really are something, Sukie.
Cut it out now.

51:20.370 --> 51:25.500
Sugar, we ain't never gonna
get anywhere, lessen I start your motor.

51:45.478 --> 51:47.272
Isn't this a good place, Henry ?

51:50.316 --> 51:53.987
It's a good place,
but is it a good idea ?

51:54.112 --> 51:58.074
My, you've gotten cautious of late.

51:58.199 --> 52:00.618
Didn't used to be this careful.

52:00.743 --> 52:03.705
You wasn't engaged then.

52:03.830 --> 52:06.958
I don't feel all that engaged.

52:07.083 --> 52:11.879
Besides, you always did
make me feel funny.

52:13.464 --> 52:16.342
You sure you know
what you're doing ?

52:16.467 --> 52:18.678
I ought to.

52:18.803 --> 52:22.265
Done it often enough before,
haven't we ?

52:22.390 --> 52:24.976
What about Howard ?

52:25.101 --> 52:29.105
Howard's a nice, dull boy

52:29.230 --> 52:31.232
with lots of nice, dull money.

52:31.357 --> 52:35.486
And I aim to make him a nice,
dull wife.

52:35.612 --> 52:38.281
Until the wedding,

52:38.406 --> 52:41.409
don't I have the right
to take my fun while I can ?

52:43.661 --> 52:45.538
Welcome home, sugar.

52:46.915 --> 52:48.583
It's nice to be back.

53:04.891 --> 53:08.561
Julie, honey, open up. It's me.

53:13.650 --> 53:16.110
Julie, open this door, you hear?

53:16.235 --> 53:18.112
I know you're in there.

53:22.241 --> 53:23.826
You don't open this damn thing,

53:24.535 --> 53:26.329
I warn you, I'm gonna kick it down.

53:41.261 --> 53:43.846
Don't you come in here.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.766
Don't you touch me. No.

53:49.686 --> 53:51.187
Stop it.

53:52.438 --> 53:53.940
No.

54:00.363 --> 54:02.198
Stop it.

54:46.117 --> 54:50.288
Mama, what are you up to now ?

54:50.413 --> 54:54.375
You don't think I'm gonna let
my Miss Julie

54:54.500 --> 54:56.502
find me in my nightgown ?

54:56.628 --> 55:01.257
- She coming here ?
- Done sent me word this morning.

55:02.425 --> 55:04.719
Mama, Miss Julie's after something.

55:04.844 --> 55:07.680
You know Henry Warren
put her up to coming out here.

55:08.556 --> 55:10.516
I ain't saying he didn't.

55:10.642 --> 55:15.146
But after I explains it to her,
she's gonna fix things.

55:15.271 --> 55:16.898
Make him leave us alone.

55:17.023 --> 55:21.736
- And if she don't?
- Then I'll say, we won't sell.

55:21.861 --> 55:25.823
Mama, in your whole life
you ain't never said no to white folks.

55:26.366 --> 55:31.079
It won't come to that with my Julie Ann.
You going to see that today.

55:31.204 --> 55:35.333
You gonna see how
that child pay me heed.

55:35.458 --> 55:39.295
Lord Almighty. There she is.

55:43.716 --> 55:45.885
Shucks, and we thought
it was white folks.

55:46.010 --> 55:48.221
Mind your manners, Reeve.

55:48.346 --> 55:51.516
Hello, Professor Thurlow.
How you been keeping ?

55:51.641 --> 55:53.685
Tolerable, Rose, just tolerable.

55:53.810 --> 55:56.104
- And you ?
- Right smart, thank you.

55:56.229 --> 56:00.858
- It's nice to see you again, Aunt Rose.
- You married yet, Vivian ?

56:02.485 --> 56:06.572
You're wasting your time, Mama.
She ain't studying to marry no farmer.

56:06.698 --> 56:10.535
- Is that so ?
- Well, not this farmer anyway.

56:29.220 --> 56:30.680
Mama, she's here.

56:30.805 --> 56:33.433
I'd be obliged if the two of you
would take this boy of mine

56:33.558 --> 56:35.226
out of here and keep him busy.

56:35.310 --> 56:37.312
We'll come back later.

56:41.941 --> 56:44.527
- Auntie Rose.
- Julie Ann.

56:44.652 --> 56:49.240
- My Julie Ann.
- Auntie Rose.

56:50.241 --> 56:53.286
And you done brought Colie.
My, he's grown.

56:53.411 --> 56:55.413
Come along, Colie,
say hello to Aunt Rose.

56:55.538 --> 56:58.583
Leave him be, child.
Let him take his own time.

57:00.501 --> 57:03.171
Come on, let go, Colie.

57:03.296 --> 57:06.466
Come on, turn loose, precious.
Turn loose.

57:07.342 --> 57:10.094
I better get these in water.

57:32.116 --> 57:37.247
I declare, Rose, I never saw Colie take
to anyone like he does to you.

57:37.372 --> 57:39.290
Children know who loves them.

57:39.415 --> 57:43.086
Sometimes, Rose, I think you just
about invented love.

57:43.670 --> 57:45.129
Least ways for me.

57:45.255 --> 57:49.175
Hush now, child,
you'll be making me cry.

57:49.300 --> 57:51.219
Mind if I crochet while we talk ?

57:51.344 --> 57:54.597
Course not.
What's that you're working ?

57:54.722 --> 57:58.643
It's an afghan. Like the one my Great
Aunt Isabelle made, remember?

57:58.768 --> 58:03.064
Honey, why this afghan is elegant.

58:03.189 --> 58:07.568
I'm making it for you, Rose,
with devotion in every stitch.

58:07.694 --> 58:09.487
For me ?

58:09.612 --> 58:12.824
Well, it's... It's only the tiniest
little part of what I feel.

58:19.080 --> 58:21.499
- Hi there, Cousin Henry.
- Hi.

58:25.253 --> 58:27.714
- Hi there, Lou.
- Henry.

58:29.632 --> 58:32.260
- Rad home ?
- No, he went into town.

58:32.385 --> 58:35.430
Charles. Mind if I wait for him ?

58:35.555 --> 58:37.932
- Suit yourself.
- Hi there, Cousin Henry.

58:38.057 --> 58:40.268
- Look what I brought.
- ls it for me ?

58:40.393 --> 58:42.729
Well, maybe.
Let's see if you can use it.

58:48.359 --> 58:50.403
You and Rad made up your mind
if you're gonna sell the place ?

58:50.528 --> 58:53.072
You're gonna have
to talk to Rad about it, Henry.

58:53.197 --> 58:54.324
Okay.

58:54.449 --> 58:57.577
- I hope you folks don't wait too long.
- What do you mean ?

58:57.702 --> 59:00.663
Something tells me our Reeve
ain't gonna be so picky

59:00.747 --> 59:02.415
about making $5,000.

59:02.540 --> 59:04.751
You mean, you pay them
as much as white folks ?

59:04.876 --> 59:06.252
I will if I have to.

59:06.377 --> 59:11.174
If you'll accept my deal real quick,
I'll up my offer on your place to 7,000.

59:13.551 --> 59:16.596
- Rad will be right back, Henry.
- Okay.

59:17.764 --> 59:19.140
Charles ?

59:21.225 --> 59:23.645
I kept meaning to come, Rose.
You know that.

59:23.770 --> 59:29.567
- And Mr. Henry, how's he keeping ?
- Fine, but always on the go.

59:29.692 --> 59:31.653
I never seem to see him anymore.

59:32.278 --> 59:35.114
- A man's got to work, child.
- I know.

59:36.199 --> 59:37.742
Funny, isn't it?

59:37.867 --> 59:40.620
Papa nearly had a fit when
I ran off and married Henry.

59:41.329 --> 59:45.083
Now it's Henry that's putting all
the old Colfax land back together again.

59:45.208 --> 59:47.794
Doing what Papa dreamed
of all his life.

59:47.919 --> 59:50.421
I'm happy things are working
out for you.

59:50.546 --> 59:52.548
Did you hear Henry's made
this marvelous deal

59:52.674 --> 59:54.342
with the Riverside people ?

59:54.467 --> 59:57.136
They're gonna buy up
all the land Papa left me.

59:57.262 --> 59:58.388
Really '2

59:58.513 --> 01:00:01.933
Henry's been working just as hard as
can be to bring it about.

01:00:02.058 --> 01:00:06.229
And, well, just to show you
how sweet he can be,

01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:08.564
just now he's got them
to offer as much for your land

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.608
as they're paying for mine.

01:00:10.733 --> 01:00:13.361
And he let me be the one
to bring you the glad tidings.

01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:14.946
Is that why you called ?

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:18.866
Aunt Rose, I was planning
to come anyway.

01:00:18.992 --> 01:00:23.788
This week or next.
I just couldn't wait to tell you.

01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:26.833
I mean, after all you've given me,
finally I can give you something back.

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:32.463
Honey, I got all I want.
This is my home, this is our living.

01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:34.841
Tell that to Mr. Henry.
You know how.

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:38.261
Rose, you'd be much more
comfortable in town.

01:00:38.386 --> 01:00:40.680
I know we can fix you up
with Kissie's folks.

01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:44.267
And I'd be able to stop by and
see you just any time I please.

01:00:44.392 --> 01:00:45.560
No.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.565
- What do you mean "no"?
- We ain't selling.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:55.194
Now, Rose darling,
now I know how you feel.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.823
But there's not a blessed thing
you can do about it.

01:00:58.948 --> 01:01:01.784
This is progress, Rose.

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:04.537
You think the 20th century
can stand still

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:07.790
just 'cause you wanna
hang on to a few little acres ?

01:01:07.916 --> 01:01:12.045
That ain't my Julie talking.
Sounds more like Henry Warren.

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:15.423
Of course this is a big
opportunity for Henry.

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:18.259
But it's my one chance, too, Rose.

01:01:20.845 --> 01:01:26.351
If Henry can make good of this,
maybe he'll settle down.

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:32.357
We might even have more children.

01:01:32.482 --> 01:01:36.444
Aunt Rose, in a manner of speaking,
it's my future I'm asking you for.

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:39.322
- It's my life.
- I ain't selling.

01:01:40.323 --> 01:01:42.200
I ain't selling our land, you hear?

01:01:42.325 --> 01:01:48.289
Rose darling, you know just as plain
as plain, this here is Colfax land.

01:01:48.456 --> 01:01:51.292
This is my land,
and it always has been.

01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:54.003
Now we made it over to
your folks during the war.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:58.424
But that was just for appearance sake,
to keep it out of Yankee hands.

01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:59.968
And, since then, we let you work it

01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:02.887
in exchange for your
keeping up the taxes and all.

01:02:03.054 --> 01:02:07.141
But there hasn't ever been any question
about who was the rightful owner.

01:02:07.308 --> 01:02:10.728
- That's a lie.
- Rose.

01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:16.401
After the war was over, the Yankees
seized all this land hereabouts.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:21.489
And my grandpa,
after just getting freed,

01:02:21.656 --> 01:02:24.951
he done hired himself
out as slave labor.

01:02:25.076 --> 01:02:28.037
Doing things you couldn't
even get a chain gang for.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.791
And he put that money aside.

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:35.003
And when this piece
come up at public auction,

01:02:35.169 --> 01:02:38.089
he bid it in at $200.

01:02:38.256 --> 01:02:40.883
And that's the God's honest truth.

01:02:41.009 --> 01:02:43.136
And well you know it.

01:02:46.014 --> 01:02:47.432
Auntie Rose.

01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:49.434
Auntie Rose.

01:02:50.602 --> 01:02:52.186
Auntie Rose.

01:02:54.606 --> 01:02:56.274
Reeve !

01:02:57.692 --> 01:02:58.901
Reeve !

01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:00.778
Somebody, help !

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.660
Reeve, she's been taken real bad.

01:03:07.744 --> 01:03:10.705
Mama ? Mama ? It's Reeve, Mama.
I'm here.

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:13.833
I don't know, it just
came over her, suddenly.

01:03:14.042 --> 01:03:16.961
Vivian, can you go for the doctor?

01:03:18.379 --> 01:03:20.340
Colie.

01:03:21.466 --> 01:03:23.760
Stop, Colie, stop it.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.221
Julie ?

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:31.267
Make her leave.

01:03:31.392 --> 01:03:32.894
What?

01:03:33.061 --> 01:03:36.105
Get well real quick,
Aunt Rose, you hear?

01:03:37.649 --> 01:03:41.611
Reeve, when she comes around,
you tell her to forget what I said.

01:03:41.778 --> 01:03:45.281
You tell her she can stay on here
in peace as long as she lives.

01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:47.116
You've got my sworn oath.

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:51.371
Come on, Colie.

01:03:53.665 --> 01:03:56.834
Will you tell her she can stay ?
Make her hear.

01:03:58.378 --> 01:04:00.213
Come on.

01:04:16.938 --> 01:04:19.482
Henry, Henry.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.735
- What's wrong, sugar?
- Henry.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.071
Why are you crying ?
You'll be all right.

01:04:25.196 --> 01:04:27.657
- Is there anything I can do ?
- No, she'll be all right.

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:30.159
Henry, it was just awful.

01:04:30.285 --> 01:04:32.495
Calm down, honey,
let me drive you on home.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.665
I told her everything about
Riverside, just like you said.

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:39.127
But before we could settle anything
she had a terrible attack.

01:04:39.252 --> 01:04:43.089
Hi, Rad. You gonna be home later ?
I might stop by.

01:04:43.214 --> 01:04:46.050
Look what Cousin Henry got me.

01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:49.137
I don't know what my plans are, Henry,
but they don't include you.

01:04:49.262 --> 01:04:51.180
Rad, you best hear
what Henry has to say.

01:04:51.306 --> 01:04:55.643
We ain't selling out, and that's final.
You just run along home.

01:04:55.768 --> 01:04:59.480
- Take your toys with you.
- Those were a present for Charles.

01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:02.734
Charles got a ball and glove
of his own.

01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:07.363
What'd you tell him that for ?
I ain't got no ball and glove.

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:11.868
Henry Warren ain't buying nothing
for this family. Or from us neither.

01:05:13.161 --> 01:05:14.829
Don't cry, darling.

01:05:14.954 --> 01:05:17.540
Your lovely, pretty little face
is gonna get all ugly.

01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:20.627
- It's just us now.
- Now, now, now.

01:05:20.752 --> 01:05:22.921
You don't wanna be all puffy
and everything, do you ?

01:05:23.046 --> 01:05:27.091
Sukie, honey. Honey, what's wrong ?

01:05:27.216 --> 01:05:28.843
Papa.

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:30.303
Sukie, Sukie.

01:05:31.971 --> 01:05:33.556
Sukie, dear...

01:05:34.015 --> 01:05:36.851
Sukie, Sukie, lovey ?

01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:39.854
What in hell is going
on around here ?

01:05:39.979 --> 01:05:41.856
Well, might you ask ?

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:45.026
Well, lam asking.
ls she sick or something ?

01:05:45.151 --> 01:05:48.154
Sick ? Heartbroken is more like it.

01:05:48.279 --> 01:05:50.114
At Howard ?
Has Howard done something to her?

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:54.160
Much, much closer to home.
You done something to her.

01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:57.121
Now, Eula, don't try my patience.
I've had me a hard day today.

01:05:57.247 --> 01:06:01.459
- I'm in no mood for playing games.
- Very well. Very well.

01:06:01.584 --> 01:06:05.922
Well, now, it looks like there isn't
gonna be a single, solitary person

01:06:06.047 --> 01:06:10.301
at Sukie's wedding outside
of the immediate family.

01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:13.263
- What?
- Well, now, what'd you expect?

01:06:13.388 --> 01:06:16.766
Getting on your high horse
and threatening the minister.

01:06:16.891 --> 01:06:19.477
And moving the wedding to Bay City.

01:06:19.602 --> 01:06:24.399
You think that the folks in this town
are gonna turn on a Colfax cousin ?

01:06:24.524 --> 01:06:26.651
- You mean they've been declining ?
- No.

01:06:26.776 --> 01:06:28.778
But they have not been
accepting neither.

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:32.782
And Sukie's been getting
some mighty evasive answers

01:06:32.907 --> 01:06:34.742
when she inquires.

01:06:34.867 --> 01:06:36.619
Nobody's accepting ?

01:06:41.082 --> 01:06:43.126
None of the quality folk.

01:06:44.877 --> 01:06:48.590
I never, darling Eula.

01:06:48.715 --> 01:06:51.843
- What can we do ?
- What can we do ?

01:06:52.093 --> 01:06:54.721
Well now, there's nothing we can do.

01:06:54.846 --> 01:06:58.433
You made the trouble,
now you find a cure!

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.604
Eula, I can't just back out.

01:07:02.687 --> 01:07:04.147
The whole town heard me say it.

01:07:04.272 --> 01:07:06.274
What do you think is gonna
happen come next election

01:07:06.399 --> 01:07:08.526
if I was to go back on my word ?

01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:13.865
I don't see why that should bother you.
You never carried the town.

01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:16.618
And if it wasn't for the back
country folk,

01:07:16.743 --> 01:07:20.455
you'd still be clerking
in your uncle's store.

01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:25.376
Sukie, Sukie, sugar.

01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:27.378
Eula, it's gonna be fine.

01:07:27.503 --> 01:07:29.964
- Sukie ?
- Eula, I'm gonna...

01:07:48.942 --> 01:07:50.068
Reeve ?

01:07:53.112 --> 01:07:54.197
Reeve ?

01:07:56.324 --> 01:07:57.659
Yes, Mama ?

01:08:00.536 --> 01:08:01.871
I was wrong.

01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:08.419
I was wrong.

01:08:08.878 --> 01:08:11.005
Mama, whatever you done,

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.882
you did it because you
thought it was right.

01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:15.176
Don't fret yourself about it, please.

01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:18.220
I was a...

01:08:21.975 --> 01:08:24.685
I was a white folks' nigger.

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:27.814
I was. I was.

01:08:29.357 --> 01:08:34.779
You've got to learn from my mistakes.
You've got to fight.

01:08:34.904 --> 01:08:36.238
You've got to.

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:38.323
- I will, Mama.
- You've got to.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.951
I will.

01:08:40.702 --> 01:08:43.997
Swear to me. Swear.

01:08:44.413 --> 01:08:45.957
I swear, Mama.

01:08:46.416 --> 01:08:48.792
Ain't gonna be easy.

01:08:50.295 --> 01:08:52.964
But you'll know, at the end.

01:08:53.881 --> 01:08:59.636
You won't have this agony.
This taste of bitterness and gall.

01:09:00.013 --> 01:09:02.348
Easy, Mama, please.

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:05.727
I'm passing out of this life, Reeve.

01:09:08.062 --> 01:09:14.527
In these last minutes,
you know what I feel most of all ?

01:09:16.237 --> 01:09:17.529
Anger.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:21.618
Yes, anger and hatred.

01:09:22.535 --> 01:09:26.581
Not so much at them
for what they done to me.

01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:29.207
But at myself for letting them.

01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:31.461
No, helping them do it.

01:09:40.345 --> 01:09:42.138
And I grieve.

01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:45.975
I truly grieve

01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:50.395
for this sorry thing

01:09:51.898 --> 01:09:54.525
that has been my life.

01:09:57.153 --> 01:09:58.863
Mama ?

01:10:02.367 --> 01:10:04.118
Mama ?

01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:55.878
Henry Warren, you are
going to spoil me rotten.

01:10:57.463 --> 01:11:00.675
- I swear you will.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:11:02.594 --> 01:11:05.263
I don't remember ever being
so hungry.

01:11:06.931 --> 01:11:09.475
Promise you'll still love me
when I'm big and fat?

01:11:09.642 --> 01:11:12.687
I can think of a few exercises
to keep you in shape.

01:11:13.855 --> 01:11:16.983
Henry ! You are depraved.

01:11:17.108 --> 01:11:19.944
Making your own wife blush
before 6:00 in the morning.

01:11:20.111 --> 01:11:22.614
Got some papers here
for you to sign, honey.

01:11:22.739 --> 01:11:25.617
- Now ?
- No time like the present.

01:11:25.742 --> 01:11:29.871
I declare, Henry, you are a pest
when it comes to business.

01:11:30.038 --> 01:11:33.875
- What are they ?
- Eviction notice for the Scott place.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.838
- I told you...
- Slow down a bit.

01:11:38.963 --> 01:11:42.967
Look, they're not even dated, see ?

01:11:43.092 --> 01:11:45.678
They ain't been signed
by the court or nothing.

01:11:45.803 --> 01:11:48.890
And I swear to you by everything holy,

01:11:49.057 --> 01:11:52.226
they ain't leaving my safe
while Rose draws breath.

01:11:53.937 --> 01:11:56.814
Then I don't see why
I have to sign them right this very night.

01:11:56.981 --> 01:11:59.567
Sugar, what kind of bastard
are you gonna call me

01:11:59.734 --> 01:12:04.739
if I come running to you to sign these
the day that old woman passes on ?

01:12:05.198 --> 01:12:06.574
I never thought of that.

01:12:06.741 --> 01:12:10.662
Here. All three copies.

01:12:16.793 --> 01:12:21.589
- This is the right thing to do, Henry ?
- It's the only thing, honey.

01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:41.484
Hey, Reeve.

01:12:45.363 --> 01:12:47.031
Did I wake you ?

01:12:47.156 --> 01:12:50.535
Good. Listen,
I've been thinking things over.

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.788
About the other day, I think maybe
you've got something there

01:12:53.955 --> 01:12:57.667
about us making our places pay.
And to hell with what folks say.

01:12:57.834 --> 01:13:00.336
Improving our land's what counts.

01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:06.009
So, I brung you a loaf of Lou's bread
and a jar of her damson plum jelly.

01:13:06.175 --> 01:13:09.220
If you'll go make us a pot of
coffee, we can patch things up

01:13:09.429 --> 01:13:11.723
and get down to business.

01:13:17.895 --> 01:13:22.400
Here. And I hope you choke on it.
You uppity black bastard.

01:13:22.483 --> 01:13:27.572
- Rad, wait.
- What for ? More sass ?

01:13:28.114 --> 01:13:29.949
No, it's just...

01:13:33.453 --> 01:13:35.747
Rad, my mama just now died.

01:13:45.006 --> 01:13:47.967
She was a real
good woman, your mama.

01:13:49.427 --> 01:13:53.097
If there's a heaven,
she's there this very minute.

01:13:53.932 --> 01:13:57.352
I hope so, Rad, 'cause she had
enough of hell right here.

01:14:46.985 --> 01:14:49.153
- Morning, Reeve.
- Morning, Reverend.

01:14:49.279 --> 01:14:52.448
I wanted to give you this
for the building fund.

01:14:53.241 --> 01:14:56.202
You don't have to.
Maybe you'd rather wait a bit.

01:14:56.286 --> 01:14:58.788
No, sir. This is the way
my mama wanted it to be.

01:14:58.913 --> 01:15:03.001
She's been putting money by for the
new church ever since I can remember.

01:15:03.126 --> 01:15:06.045
- I'll announce it after the service.
- She'd like that.

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:08.798
- Morning, Reverend.
- Sheriff.

01:15:08.923 --> 01:15:11.968
- Hi there, Reeve.
- Morning, Sheriff.

01:15:12.093 --> 01:15:14.804
We sure gonna miss Aunt Rose
around here.

01:15:14.929 --> 01:15:17.974
Why, you know, she used to bring me
a bushel of new potatoes

01:15:18.099 --> 01:15:20.351
every spring, just like clockwork.

01:15:20.476 --> 01:15:23.021
Appreciate your coming, Sheriff.
Mama would have, too.

01:15:23.146 --> 01:15:26.357
Yeah, well, you see, Reeve,
I really come to bring you this.

01:15:26.482 --> 01:15:28.776
- What is it?
- They didn't waste anytime, did they ?

01:15:28.943 --> 01:15:32.030
Now, no hard feelings, Reeve.
I'm just doing my job.

01:15:32.155 --> 01:15:33.364
What is it, Reeve ?

01:15:33.489 --> 01:15:35.825
Mrs. Warren claims
the farm ain't rightly ours.

01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:38.745
This is a notice telling me
to get off the land.

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:41.289
Couldn't you have waited until
after the funeral ?

01:15:41.414 --> 01:15:43.958
Well, you know how it is, Reverend.
I'm a busy man.

01:15:44.083 --> 01:15:47.545
I ain't got time to go all the way
out there if I don't have to.

01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:50.048
- It's outrageous.
- I've been expecting it.

01:15:50.173 --> 01:15:52.216
And bad news don't
improve with waiting.

01:15:53.426 --> 01:15:54.719
- Morning, folks.
- Morning, Sheriff.

01:15:54.844 --> 01:15:56.721
How are things coming ?

01:15:56.846 --> 01:15:59.724
- Good morning, Vivian.
- Good morning, Mrs. Warren.

01:15:59.849 --> 01:16:02.268
This is my husband.

01:16:02.393 --> 01:16:04.562
Reeve, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

01:16:04.687 --> 01:16:06.272
Is that a fact ?

01:16:07.649 --> 01:16:11.527
I'd have done anything for Aunt Rose.
Anything in this world.

01:16:11.653 --> 01:16:14.697
If you mean that, you can just
take yourself on out of here.

01:16:14.822 --> 01:16:17.867
- Reeve ?
- Listen here, boy.

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.203
We know you're grieving.

01:16:20.286 --> 01:16:22.997
But that don't give you
leave to insult my wife.

01:16:24.249 --> 01:16:27.293
This here nigger, he told Julie
he don't want her at the funeral.

01:16:27.418 --> 01:16:29.712
And this here nigger
meant what he said.

01:16:29.837 --> 01:16:31.172
You can't stop me.

01:16:31.547 --> 01:16:34.759
He's Rose's next of kin,
his wishes ought to be respected.

01:16:35.718 --> 01:16:39.347
Come on, sugar,
no skin off our noses.

01:16:39.472 --> 01:16:41.933
Just as you say, Cousin Clem.

01:17:18.177 --> 01:17:21.514
I can't expect any better
from a field hand like Reeve.

01:17:21.723 --> 01:17:26.728
But Clem ? After all I did for him ?

01:17:26.894 --> 01:17:29.397
Taking his side against the Judge.

01:17:36.029 --> 01:17:40.074
Miss Sukie Purcell has just
got herself a matron of honor.

01:17:40.158 --> 01:17:42.994
That ought to fix Clem's wagon.

01:17:43.119 --> 01:17:45.955
And just to make sure
folks don't miss the point,

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:50.209
I'm gonna offer Sukie the loan
of my mama's lace wedding veil.

01:18:52.522 --> 01:18:54.899
Anybody here ?

01:19:14.544 --> 01:19:16.713
Good morning, Judge.

01:19:18.715 --> 01:19:21.342
Up. up!

01:19:22.343 --> 01:19:25.263
- Sir?
- Up on your feet.

01:19:26.931 --> 01:19:30.518
- Miss Ada, come on in here!
- You want me, Judge ?

01:19:30.685 --> 01:19:33.730
- Who let this gal in here ?
- Why, where'd she come from ?

01:19:33.855 --> 01:19:35.064
Get the Sheriff.

01:19:36.107 --> 01:19:38.484
What has come over you people ?

01:19:39.444 --> 01:19:41.529
Have you no sense of decorum ?

01:19:41.654 --> 01:19:45.700
Isn't there a trace
of respect left in any of you ?

01:19:46.534 --> 01:19:49.537
- You answer me.
- I'd be glad to, Judge.

01:19:49.704 --> 01:19:52.707
Which question would you
like me to start with ?

01:19:52.957 --> 01:19:54.000
Yes, sir?

01:19:54.167 --> 01:19:58.379
This gal wandered
right into my private office.

01:19:58.546 --> 01:20:00.673
- Hi, Vivian.
- Hello, Sheriff.

01:20:00.924 --> 01:20:04.469
How come you know her?
ls she some kind of habitual criminal ?

01:20:04.719 --> 01:20:08.348
Hell no, Judge. This here's Vivian.
Professor Thurlow's granddaughter.

01:20:08.473 --> 01:20:10.892
Yes ?
Well, I just caught her red-handed.

01:20:11.059 --> 01:20:13.561
- Stealing ?
- No, sitting.

01:20:13.728 --> 01:20:17.106
- Sitting ?
- Yes, sitting.

01:20:17.398 --> 01:20:19.859
Now, Vivian, you know better than that.

01:20:20.068 --> 01:20:23.321
Suppose you tell the Judge
why you come in here in the first place.

01:20:23.488 --> 01:20:26.616
I need permission to do
some research in your records

01:20:26.783 --> 01:20:29.202
for a class I'm preparing
on local history.

01:20:29.619 --> 01:20:32.247
Someone from your school board
will have to get you

01:20:32.413 --> 01:20:35.041
an authorization from
the county commission for that.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:38.670
Now, Judge, you're just being modest.

01:20:38.836 --> 01:20:41.130
We all know who has
the last word around here.

01:20:41.297 --> 01:20:43.508
I don't know
what harm it would do, Judge.

01:20:43.716 --> 01:20:45.927
And when we get to more
modern times,

01:20:46.094 --> 01:20:48.680
I do hope you'll come
and talk to my class.

01:20:48.846 --> 01:20:50.932
Well, I'm a mighty busy man.

01:20:51.307 --> 01:20:53.643
Still, I suppose I could
spare a few minutes.

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:55.019
It would be my duty...

01:20:55.186 --> 01:20:58.356
I can't possibly tell you
what it would mean to them.

01:20:58.523 --> 01:21:00.191
- Miss Ada ?
- Yes, sir?

01:21:00.358 --> 01:21:04.237
Will you take Vivian here down to
records, give her whatever she wants.

01:21:05.154 --> 01:21:09.576
You're such a perfect example
of everything southern.

01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:19.586
We have the Judge's permission.

01:21:19.752 --> 01:21:20.795
Sure enough.

01:21:21.296 --> 01:21:24.090
All the records
are in chronological order.

01:21:24.257 --> 01:21:27.594
Starting at the very back and
ending up in the front row here.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.221
- Thank you.
- Better take one of these.

01:21:30.388 --> 01:21:33.141
Things can get a mite dusty back there.

01:21:33.308 --> 01:21:36.561
Wouldn't hurt if you was to
give them a lick and a promise.

01:22:02.253 --> 01:22:05.882
- Here's the list and my share.
- We'll settle up later.

01:22:06.049 --> 01:22:08.217
Okay, I'll wait here.

01:22:10.678 --> 01:22:13.598
- Hey, Ozzie, how are you ?
- Afternoon, Mrs. McDowell.

01:22:13.765 --> 01:22:16.434
- Hi, Ozzie, how you been ?
- Just fine and you ?

01:22:16.601 --> 01:22:18.227
- Never better.
- Hi, Rad.

01:22:18.561 --> 01:22:21.314
Dolph. Got a big order for you, Ozzie.

01:22:21.481 --> 01:22:24.150
- That's what I like to hear.
- First off, I want dynamite.

01:22:24.317 --> 01:22:25.735
One hundred and fifty pounds.

01:22:25.902 --> 01:22:28.571
Do you want black powder
or cartridges ?

01:22:28.738 --> 01:22:31.741
I'm not sure, wait a minute.

01:22:31.991 --> 01:22:34.786
Reeve, come on in here a minute,
will you ?

01:22:36.454 --> 01:22:38.164
Do we want black powder
or cartridges ?

01:22:38.331 --> 01:22:43.044
- Cartridges, eight inches.
- Cartridges, eight inches.

01:22:43.419 --> 01:22:46.464
Seems like black powder
would be more natural.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:53.304
We don't have no 40% left,
is 50 okay ?

01:22:54.722 --> 01:22:57.267
- Is it?
- Yes.

01:22:57.517 --> 01:22:59.352
Yeah, 50's okay, Ozzie.

01:22:59.644 --> 01:23:01.771
What is this, "Amos 'n Andy" ?

01:23:02.522 --> 01:23:05.024
Reeve knows more
about this sort of thing than I do.

01:23:05.191 --> 01:23:07.402
It is you that's buying it though,
isn't it?

01:23:07.569 --> 01:23:09.404
- You wanna see the permit?
- Yeah.

01:23:09.571 --> 01:23:13.616
No offense, Rad, just making sure.
Kenny ? Kenny, come out here.

01:23:13.783 --> 01:23:16.452
Take that boy around back
and fill his order.

01:23:16.703 --> 01:23:19.455
Rad, have you forgotten
how we do things around here ?

01:23:19.622 --> 01:23:21.541
Hardly.

01:23:22.667 --> 01:23:26.546
You remember that little hunt club
we all started a while back ?

01:23:26.754 --> 01:23:31.259
Well, it's coming along real fine.
Got almost 200 members now.

01:23:31.426 --> 01:23:33.511
And we kept you on the active list.

01:23:33.678 --> 01:23:36.347
I ain't got much time
for that sort of thing anymore.

01:23:36.514 --> 01:23:39.851
- Well, you'd better make time.
- It ain't the time that's stopping him.

01:23:40.101 --> 01:23:42.604
He just don't have any clean sheets.

01:23:45.982 --> 01:23:48.192
Come on, kids, we'll wait outside.

01:23:48.693 --> 01:23:50.403
- Hey, Rad.
- What's up ?

01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:53.406
They're trying to unload stuff
on us that's two years old.

01:23:53.615 --> 01:23:55.950
Worse yet, it's been water-soaked,
you can see the stains.

01:23:56.117 --> 01:23:59.913
- Ozzie, what is this ?
- That's all we got. Take it or leave it.

01:24:00.079 --> 01:24:03.374
We'll leave it. Come on, Reeve,
let's go over to Bay City.

01:24:03.541 --> 01:24:06.794
Hold your horses.
Can't you take a little joke ?

01:24:07.086 --> 01:24:11.007
Kenny, show him the new stuff.
What's come over you, Rad ?

01:24:11.174 --> 01:24:14.802
- How much is it gonna be ?
- Well, let's see.

01:24:15.929 --> 01:24:19.057
Caps, a roll of wire,

01:24:19.223 --> 01:24:21.768
blasting box, and the dynamite.

01:24:21.935 --> 01:24:26.856
Comes to $97.50.

01:24:27.023 --> 01:24:28.691
- Use this.
- Taking it with you ?

01:24:28.858 --> 01:24:29.817
Yeah.

01:24:29.984 --> 01:24:31.611
Except for the charges
and the blasting box.

01:24:31.778 --> 01:24:35.114
- We'll come back for these.
- No, we'll take it all in one trip.

01:24:35.281 --> 01:24:39.744
- You can't do that.
- Don't you give me orders.

01:24:40.161 --> 01:24:44.040
I wonder if Lou is as friendly
with that coon as Rad is ?

01:25:01.391 --> 01:25:04.894
Rad, we can't take dynamite
and fuses in the same trip.

01:25:05.061 --> 01:25:07.897
- We're not coming back here.
- It's crazy, I tell you.

01:25:10.191 --> 01:25:12.026
You think that was any picnic
for me in there ?

01:25:12.193 --> 01:25:14.028
You go on, I'll take the fuses.

01:25:14.195 --> 01:25:15.196
Let's go.

01:25:18.616 --> 01:25:22.036
That's just gorgeous.
Absolutely breathtaking.

01:25:22.203 --> 01:25:25.415
- Tell Mama good-bye, Colie.
- What's he all dressed up for?

01:25:25.582 --> 01:25:26.958
Hi, Sukie, hi, Eula.

01:25:27.125 --> 01:25:29.335
I'm taking him out to Riverside
with me.

01:25:29.502 --> 01:25:31.462
Today ?
I thought you were gonna be so busy.

01:25:31.838 --> 01:25:34.090
It's about time he saw
his old man in action.

01:25:34.257 --> 01:25:35.967
- So long, everybody.
- So long.

01:25:36.134 --> 01:25:38.636
- Bye.
- What a sweet little boy he is.

01:25:38.803 --> 01:25:41.848
- He's got such bright little eyes.
- I'll be right back.

01:25:46.394 --> 01:25:48.313
Henry ?

01:25:51.399 --> 01:25:53.985
Henry, don't you think it might be better
to wait for some other day ?

01:25:54.152 --> 01:25:56.362
You still don't trust me
with him, do you ?

01:25:56.988 --> 01:25:58.740
- It's not that.
- Yes, it is.

01:25:58.907 --> 01:26:01.159
I thought you'd gotten over that.

01:26:01.701 --> 01:26:05.872
All right. Have a good time.
I sure wish I was going with you.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.125
Why don't you drive out to Riverside
after Sukie's rehearsal ?

01:26:09.292 --> 01:26:12.837
All right. It's a date.

01:26:13.922 --> 01:26:16.883
It's ridiculous how she pretends
there isn't a thing wrong with that boy.

01:26:17.050 --> 01:26:20.178
Why the whole town knows
he's never even said...

01:26:21.095 --> 01:26:22.764
Well, don't stop on my account.

01:26:22.931 --> 01:26:28.394
Julie, honey, I hope you don't think
that we would talk behind your back.

01:26:28.561 --> 01:26:31.231
- Unkindly, I mean.
- God forbid.

01:26:31.648 --> 01:26:34.400
It was just that Mama noticed
a resemblance between me

01:26:34.567 --> 01:26:36.361
and your Great Aunt Isabelle
over here.

01:26:36.527 --> 01:26:39.864
Yes, and I was telling them how
Vernon, that's the Judge,

01:26:40.406 --> 01:26:43.451
he says we're related to the Colfaxes.

01:26:43.618 --> 01:26:47.455
- Way, way back, mind you.
- So were Adam and Eve.

01:26:47.622 --> 01:26:51.709
Sukie, you feel free to borrow as many
of my ancestors as you need.

01:26:53.253 --> 01:26:56.798
They go along with the wedding veil.
No extra charge.

01:26:57.173 --> 01:27:00.969
Miss Byrd, something seems
to be climbing up in back there.

01:27:29.956 --> 01:27:33.418
Where the hell is everyone ?

01:27:38.965 --> 01:27:42.302
There now, there now.
It's all right, Colie, it's all right.

01:27:42.468 --> 01:27:44.470
Daddy's here. Daddy's...

01:27:44.637 --> 01:27:46.931
Be quiet, will you ?

01:27:47.765 --> 01:27:49.601
Look here, look here.

01:27:49.767 --> 01:27:52.186
Sit. There you go.

01:27:52.353 --> 01:27:54.105
There you are. Ain't that great ?
Look.

01:27:54.355 --> 01:27:57.609
Wait. Wait, Colie, look.
Look what Daddy's got for you.

01:27:58.026 --> 01:28:00.945
Look here what Daddy's got.

01:28:01.112 --> 01:28:02.488
Look here.

01:28:02.655 --> 01:28:05.325
Look, look, Colie.
Look, put your hand on there.

01:28:05.491 --> 01:28:06.701
There you go. Look.

01:28:07.327 --> 01:28:11.289
Ain't that something ? Two hands.
Go on, go on.

01:28:57.085 --> 01:29:01.714
Stop it, you two. Stop it.
Have you gone crazy or something ?

01:29:01.881 --> 01:29:05.218
- Good morning, Cousin Henry.
- I'll have the law on you for this.

01:29:05.385 --> 01:29:06.970
Got a permit, Henry.

01:29:07.136 --> 01:29:10.682
All we doing is blasting out
some irrigation ditches like y'all did.

01:29:10.848 --> 01:29:13.434
- All set, Rad ?
- All set.

01:29:14.269 --> 01:29:17.397
No offense, Cousin Henry,
but we're about to blast.

01:29:17.564 --> 01:29:19.941
Go right ahead.

01:29:20.108 --> 01:29:23.528
Okay, Reeve, let her rip.

01:29:42.755 --> 01:29:44.716
I'll get you for this!

01:29:46.718 --> 01:29:49.804
Okay, everybody,
back on the job, you hear?

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.516
Well, we done it.

01:31:02.543 --> 01:31:04.754
What the hell kind of sheriff
are you anyway,

01:31:04.921 --> 01:31:07.131
letting a nigger run loose
with dynamite ?

01:31:07.632 --> 01:31:10.718
Of course I'm sure. He set that charge
off without any warning.

01:31:10.885 --> 01:31:13.388
With my little boy right
in the line of fire.

01:31:13.554 --> 01:31:17.016
Sure he saw him, you think he's blind ?
Now you listen, Chalmer,

01:31:17.225 --> 01:31:19.477
they got Colie in the emergency room
this very minute.

01:31:19.644 --> 01:31:21.688
So if you know what's good for you,
you'll round up a posse,

01:31:21.854 --> 01:31:23.606
go out there and
arrest that nigger right now.

01:31:23.773 --> 01:31:25.775
- How is he, Doctor?
- He's got a nasty crack on the head.

01:31:26.067 --> 01:31:27.902
All we can do for now
is put him under sedation.

01:31:28.069 --> 01:31:30.446
Tomorrow we'll start tests.

01:33:17.428 --> 01:33:20.056
Now take it easy,
they got dynamite.

01:33:20.223 --> 01:33:22.892
- Now fan out there, boys.
- You going in there alone, Chalmer ?

01:33:23.059 --> 01:33:24.769
I'll yell if I need help.

01:33:31.734 --> 01:33:35.280
Okay, Reeve, come on out of there,
and don't try no funny business.

01:33:35.655 --> 01:33:37.073
Go on, go on.

01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:51.170
Nice of you to drop by, Sheriff.

01:33:51.588 --> 01:33:54.382
Well, this ain't no social call.
I come to get Reeve.

01:33:54.549 --> 01:33:56.009
He's in there somewhere.

01:33:56.593 --> 01:33:59.137
Help yourself, Sheriff,
it's right out of the pan.

01:33:59.429 --> 01:34:03.349
Here, Sheriff.
Chicken can be mighty dry eating.

01:34:03.641 --> 01:34:05.727
Thanks... Hey, Reeve.

01:34:06.436 --> 01:34:08.646
Hello, honey, how are you ?

01:34:08.813 --> 01:34:11.774
- Not now, Clara. Reeve !
- Wonderful, isn't it, Sheriff ?

01:34:11.941 --> 01:34:15.862
The way Rad and Reeve are fixing
their places over, just like Riverside did.

01:34:16.029 --> 01:34:18.114
Here, Sheriff, let me put a stick in that
for you.

01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:20.617
- I got to take you in, Reeve.
- What for ?

01:34:20.783 --> 01:34:23.369
Perhaps you could be good
enough to state the charge.

01:34:23.536 --> 01:34:25.747
Now you know good and well
what he did.

01:34:26.039 --> 01:34:27.206
Now, I'm warning you, Reeve,

01:34:27.373 --> 01:34:29.417
either you come along nice
and peaceful-like,

01:34:29.584 --> 01:34:31.961
or I'm gonna have to call in
the rest of my boys to help me.

01:34:32.128 --> 01:34:34.756
- What's wrong, Sheriff ?
- Good evening, Reverend.

01:34:35.131 --> 01:34:38.051
I didn't expect to see you here.
I got to arrest Reeve.

01:34:38.217 --> 01:34:41.262
Henry Warren's proffering charges
against him on account of

01:34:41.429 --> 01:34:43.097
the dynamiting he done today.

01:34:43.264 --> 01:34:44.474
Do you have a warrant?

01:34:44.599 --> 01:34:47.852
I can't wait for a warrant
every time a law gets broke.

01:34:47.977 --> 01:34:49.687
Especially not in an emergency.

01:34:49.854 --> 01:34:53.149
Sheriff, those men out there,
they say they waiting on you.

01:34:53.316 --> 01:34:55.902
Well, you go on back
and tell them to hold their water.

01:34:56.069 --> 01:34:58.112
I'm conducting an investigation
in here.

01:34:58.321 --> 01:35:01.282
I'm sorry about all this, Professor.

01:35:01.449 --> 01:35:04.202
You know I like you people,
I like being with you.

01:35:04.369 --> 01:35:08.498
I like all the joshing
and jiving and jostling that goes on.

01:35:08.915 --> 01:35:11.417
And I like your little gals, too.

01:35:11.584 --> 01:35:13.002
You know what we say,

01:35:13.169 --> 01:35:15.838
"The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice."

01:35:16.589 --> 01:35:21.261
Hell, ain't I always treated you folks
better than a daddy would ?

01:35:21.427 --> 01:35:23.137
I wouldn't know about that, Sheriff.

01:35:23.388 --> 01:35:26.224
It's been a long time since
I've had need for a daddy.

01:35:26.391 --> 01:35:28.685
- Chalmer!
- Chalmer ?

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.728
Chalmer, you all right in there ?

01:35:30.979 --> 01:35:33.523
Now, hush up, y'all,
I'm talking business.

01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:35.775
- What's there to talk about?
- Shut up !

01:35:35.942 --> 01:35:38.069
When I need you, I'll call.

01:35:39.946 --> 01:35:41.364
Okay, Reeve, come on, let's go.

01:35:41.531 --> 01:35:44.867
We wouldn't want to see you get into
any trouble over a false arrest, Sheriff.

01:35:45.201 --> 01:35:46.744
Maybe you ought to get
a warrant first ?

01:35:46.911 --> 01:35:49.289
Now I can get me a warrant
just like that.

01:35:49.497 --> 01:35:52.792
Reeve has been blasting on land
that's under a court order.

01:35:52.959 --> 01:35:56.212
- You've got to taste my cake, honey.
- I'm full to bursting, Clara.

01:35:56.379 --> 01:35:58.673
There wasn't any blasting done
on Reeve's land, Sheriff.

01:35:58.923 --> 01:36:02.760
- Only on Rad McDowell's.
- That ain't what Henry Warren said.

01:36:02.927 --> 01:36:04.929
Why don't we let the court
settle it tomorrow ?

01:36:05.096 --> 01:36:06.931
I'll guarantee Reeve's appearance there,

01:36:07.098 --> 01:36:09.809
and if it turns out that he's done
anything illegal,

01:36:09.976 --> 01:36:11.978
you can arrest him then.

01:36:12.729 --> 01:36:15.106
Well, I guess your word's
good enough for me, Reverend.

01:36:15.273 --> 01:36:17.567
Here, take this along with you
for the ride back, honey.

01:36:17.817 --> 01:36:20.570
- Eat this in good health.
- Why, thank you.

01:36:22.572 --> 01:36:24.282
- Good night, y'all.
- Good night.

01:36:25.116 --> 01:36:26.159
Where's the nigger?

01:36:26.326 --> 01:36:28.119
What's going on, Chalmer,
they stampede you ?

01:36:28.286 --> 01:36:29.329
Did he take it on the run ?

01:36:29.495 --> 01:36:31.998
Now mind your own business,
all of you !

01:36:32.165 --> 01:36:34.876
There's been a little misunderstanding,
we nearly made us a big mistake.

01:36:35.043 --> 01:36:39.005
- You mean we ain't taking him in ?
- Just let me run my own office, Dolph.

01:36:39.172 --> 01:36:41.174
Anytime I want him,
I know just where he is.

01:36:41.382 --> 01:36:43.217
Right in the palm of my hand.

01:37:09.077 --> 01:37:10.411
- Sheriff.
- Rad.

01:37:14.832 --> 01:37:16.334
- Hi, Chalmer.
- Henry.

01:37:19.963 --> 01:37:21.631
Good luck, Henry.

01:37:29.097 --> 01:37:30.265
Stand up, please.

01:37:31.474 --> 01:37:34.060
The honorable 20th judicial
court holding in

01:37:34.185 --> 01:37:36.271
and for the County
of Colfax, State of Georgia,

01:37:36.396 --> 01:37:38.481
the Honorable Judge
Vernon Purcell presiding.

01:37:38.648 --> 01:37:40.608
Peace, honor, and quiet
are hereby commanded.

01:37:41.442 --> 01:37:44.320
God save our state
and this honorable court.

01:37:45.446 --> 01:37:46.781
Be seated.

01:37:48.408 --> 01:37:52.662
I will now pick up the matter
of the estate of Rose Scott,

01:37:52.829 --> 01:37:55.164
recently deceased, of this county.

01:37:55.623 --> 01:37:56.624
What is it, Henry ?

01:37:56.833 --> 01:38:01.129
Your Honor, I would like to present
Mr. Lars Finchley from Atlanta.

01:38:01.296 --> 01:38:03.923
Mr. Finchley, you represent
Riverside in this matter?

01:38:04.674 --> 01:38:08.344
No, Your Honor, I'm attorney for
Mrs. Julie Ann Colfax Warren,

01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:11.097
interested party in the
disposition of the estate.

01:38:11.264 --> 01:38:13.349
Fine, fine. What is it?

01:38:14.267 --> 01:38:15.935
Judge, could we wait
a few minutes, please ?

01:38:16.102 --> 01:38:17.562
My lawyer must've been held up a little.

01:38:17.729 --> 01:38:20.481
- You went and got yourself a lawyer?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:21.232 --> 01:38:22.650
I must say, I'm surprised.

01:38:22.817 --> 01:38:25.278
You folks don't generally
come to court with lawyers.

01:38:25.695 --> 01:38:27.488
That's why we generally lose.

01:38:27.989 --> 01:38:30.909
It's a shame you had to go and
squander your money that way.

01:38:31.284 --> 01:38:33.661
You don't need a lawyer.
Now, this court is your lawyer.

01:38:33.828 --> 01:38:36.539
- Fair and impartial.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:36.956 --> 01:38:39.709
Now, then, I can't delay
the business of this court.

01:38:39.876 --> 01:38:42.503
But if, as we go along,
you have any questions,

01:38:42.670 --> 01:38:45.590
if you don't understand
some of our two-dollar words,

01:38:45.757 --> 01:38:48.301
if you're not exactly sure
what your rights are,

01:38:48.468 --> 01:38:51.471
you just speak up and ask me.
That's all, you may sit down.

01:38:51.638 --> 01:38:53.765
- Sorry I'm late, Your Honor.
- Now who's that ?

01:38:53.932 --> 01:38:58.144
Carter Sillens, Bay City. I'm here to
represent the Rose Scott estate.

01:38:59.729 --> 01:39:01.481
Approach the bench.

01:39:05.401 --> 01:39:09.656
Are you aware, sir,
how extraordinary it is for a white man

01:39:09.822 --> 01:39:12.742
to come into my court
and represent a black boy ?

01:39:13.409 --> 01:39:17.080
No more than it was for my daddy to
present me with a negro half-brother.

01:39:17.247 --> 01:39:20.416
Don't you rattle your skeleton
in my court there, sir.

01:39:21.042 --> 01:39:23.711
Your being here at all
constitutes a treachery

01:39:24.003 --> 01:39:27.131
to the entire white community
that's too colossal to be believed.

01:39:27.382 --> 01:39:29.884
Well, it makes my half-brother
very proud.

01:39:30.301 --> 01:39:32.428
You know, I would like to state
at the outset,

01:39:32.595 --> 01:39:35.890
that I object to the irregularities
of these proceedings.

01:39:36.766 --> 01:39:40.395
They were called illegally,
and they are being conducted illegally.

01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:43.856
We have our own way of doing
things in this county, Mr. Sillens.

01:39:44.524 --> 01:39:47.819
And we don't hesitate
to cut through red tape

01:39:47.986 --> 01:39:50.154
for the benefit of our citizens.

01:39:50.321 --> 01:39:53.283
And we don't need any advice
from Bay City

01:39:53.616 --> 01:39:57.870
on how to run our judicial system.
This is a simple, informal parlay.

01:39:58.037 --> 01:40:02.083
If it's so simple and informal,
why the high-priced legal talent ?

01:40:02.333 --> 01:40:07.255
Because this here estate is disputed,
and Rose Scott died intestate.

01:40:07.422 --> 01:40:12.552
Rose Scott did not die intestate,
and I am here to file her will.

01:40:12.802 --> 01:40:15.430
Your Honor, if it pleases the court,

01:40:15.930 --> 01:40:18.391
I suggest the whole question
of a will is immaterial.

01:40:18.558 --> 01:40:19.642
How's that ?

01:40:19.809 --> 01:40:22.186
Because there's a prior claim
to the property.

01:40:22.353 --> 01:40:26.983
My client, Mrs. Warren, informed
the deceased and her son of that claim.

01:40:27.442 --> 01:40:30.028
And an eviction notice
was issued to Reeve Scott

01:40:30.194 --> 01:40:31.946
only a few days ago.

01:40:32.113 --> 01:40:33.781
Yes, I know all that. Get to the point.

01:40:33.948 --> 01:40:36.534
Well, it's simply that if
my client's claim is upheld,

01:40:36.951 --> 01:40:40.246
then Rose Scott had no right to leave
the land in question to anyone.

01:40:40.538 --> 01:40:44.542
But I have here a photostatic
copy of a deed of sale

01:40:45.209 --> 01:40:49.255
that was issued in this county
to Jonas B. Scott.

01:40:50.298 --> 01:40:53.426
October 16th, 1866.

01:40:54.052 --> 01:40:56.346
Who's making all that racket?

01:40:56.846 --> 01:41:00.099
- Vivian Thurlow.
- And those pickaninnies with you ?

01:41:00.558 --> 01:41:04.437
My history class. I wanted them to get
a look at democracy in action.

01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:06.522
See they keep quiet, you hear?

01:41:06.773 --> 01:41:08.900
- Where were we ?
- The Scott deed.

01:41:09.817 --> 01:41:10.902
Yes.

01:41:11.653 --> 01:41:14.739
Now this can't be accepted
in evidence as a true copy,

01:41:14.906 --> 01:41:17.492
this is just a reproduction.
It's kind of blurred, too.

01:41:17.659 --> 01:41:19.077
As you wish.

01:41:20.203 --> 01:41:21.996
Here's the original.

01:41:24.582 --> 01:41:26.334
Well, this looks genuine.

01:41:27.001 --> 01:41:30.004
Of course we'll have to send it along
to Atlanta to be authenticated.

01:41:30.255 --> 01:41:34.217
Judge ? Your Honor?
I think I can be of help.

01:41:34.425 --> 01:41:35.551
Speak up then.

01:41:35.927 --> 01:41:36.928
Well, the other day,

01:41:37.095 --> 01:41:40.181
when you were kind enough
to let me do research in the old records,

01:41:40.598 --> 01:41:43.768
I happened to run across
the registration of this deed.

01:41:43.935 --> 01:41:44.978
- What?
- Yes,

01:41:45.144 --> 01:41:47.397
Miss Hemmings was good enough
to show me where to look.

01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:50.567
Naturally, being a friend of the
Scott's, it just caught my eye.

01:41:50.817 --> 01:41:55.113
As I recall, I gave you a duster
and asked you to tidy up a bit.

01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:58.491
I didn't give you leave to go
snooping into county records.

01:41:58.741 --> 01:42:00.368
No, the Judge did that.

01:42:00.535 --> 01:42:03.538
Miss Ada, did you see
this purported registration ?

01:42:03.705 --> 01:42:07.375
- No, Judge.
- Page 136, volume 10.

01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:11.504
- We only have your word for that.
- Why don't we examine the book itself?

01:42:11.671 --> 01:42:13.464
That's an excellent idea, sir.

01:42:13.631 --> 01:42:16.301
Miss Ada, can we entrust
this little mission to you ?

01:42:16.843 --> 01:42:18.678
I'll have it up here in no time.

01:42:20.972 --> 01:42:24.809
- Judge, what is all this rigmarole ?
- Let me do things my way, Henry.

01:42:24.976 --> 01:42:27.687
We didn't figure
on Reeve's having a lawyer.

01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:32.066
Now, I want to make sure that he won't
have any grounds for an appeal.

01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:36.696
Or would you prefer having my
decision reversed in a higher court ?

01:42:38.072 --> 01:42:39.616
- I understand.
- Right.

01:42:41.409 --> 01:42:44.746
Here it is, Judge. Volume 10.

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.167
Now then, what page
did you say this was ?

01:42:49.375 --> 01:42:51.753
- 136.
- 136.

01:42:53.296 --> 01:42:58.384
1154.135...

01:42:59.510 --> 01:43:01.012
Wait a minute!

01:43:01.971 --> 01:43:05.433
Wait a minute ! There isn't
even such a page as 136 here,

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.602
let alone a registration of your deed.

01:43:07.769 --> 01:43:11.105
- There must be, Judge.
- See for yourself here.

01:43:13.775 --> 01:43:16.361
There's 135, and it goes to 138.

01:43:16.653 --> 01:43:18.613
Look here, Mr. Sillens,
there's something funny going on.

01:43:18.947 --> 01:43:20.448
There's nothing unusual about that.

01:43:20.615 --> 01:43:22.116
These old records
have been through a lot.

01:43:22.283 --> 01:43:23.534
You can't expect them to be perfect.

01:43:23.701 --> 01:43:27.288
Well, you've got to admit, that's a very
convenient accident, Your Honor.

01:43:27.455 --> 01:43:29.123
Explain yourself, sir.

01:43:30.333 --> 01:43:34.712
Your Honor, I would like to put
Vivian Thurlow on the stand

01:43:35.046 --> 01:43:40.426
to testify under oath that
she saw that deed on the files

01:43:40.635 --> 01:43:42.011
just a few days ago.

01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:44.097
You know better than that, Mr. Sillens.

01:43:44.347 --> 01:43:46.891
Anything she said
would be unsubstantiated

01:43:47.016 --> 01:43:48.810
and therefore inadmissible.

01:43:49.185 --> 01:43:51.020
I would still like it on the record.

01:43:51.354 --> 01:43:53.439
Your Honor, I'm afraid
I would have to object.

01:43:53.606 --> 01:43:54.607
Sustained.

01:43:54.899 --> 01:43:58.319
Now then, lam not disallowing
this so-called deed of yours.

01:43:58.945 --> 01:44:01.823
But until we can get a
verification from Atlanta,

01:44:01.948 --> 01:44:04.993
it seems only fair we should let
Mrs. Warren present her case.

01:44:05.451 --> 01:44:07.996
Your Honor, I call Mrs. Henry Warren
to the stand.

01:44:08.204 --> 01:44:09.622
Yes, please.

01:44:18.881 --> 01:44:20.717
Raise your right hand.

01:44:20.883 --> 01:44:23.219
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

01:44:23.386 --> 01:44:24.721
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God ?

01:44:24.887 --> 01:44:25.847
I do.

01:44:26.014 --> 01:44:27.891
Please be seated.

01:44:28.892 --> 01:44:32.854
Now then, Mrs. Warren,
did you personally speak to Rose Scott

01:44:33.146 --> 01:44:35.148
and tell her about your claim
to this land ?

01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:39.277
Yes. I needed it back to
complete the Riverside package.

01:44:40.486 --> 01:44:43.907
Not that I wanted the money. I told Rose
she could keep that for herself.

01:44:44.073 --> 01:44:45.617
What'd she say ?

01:44:46.367 --> 01:44:48.953
What could she say ?
She knew it was my land.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.831
In other words, she admitted
the land belonged to you.

01:44:52.874 --> 01:44:54.042
Yes.

01:44:54.584 --> 01:44:57.670
You tell the court why
Rose Scott didn't quit this place.

01:44:59.339 --> 01:45:02.216
Well, she was very sick.
This was near the end.

01:45:03.426 --> 01:45:06.596
And I knew she wanted to die in
the house she'd lived in all her life.

01:45:06.763 --> 01:45:10.141
So I let her stay on.
That was the least I could do.

01:45:10.308 --> 01:45:12.894
And folks say
we don't take care of our own.

01:45:13.937 --> 01:45:15.897
Thank you, Mrs. Warren. That's all.

01:45:16.773 --> 01:45:20.485
One moment, Mrs. Warren.
I have a few questions I'd like to ask.

01:45:21.194 --> 01:45:24.572
How long did Rose Scott live on
this particular piece of land ?

01:45:24.864 --> 01:45:27.200
Always. She was born there.

01:45:27.575 --> 01:45:30.870
And her father ?
He was born there, too ?

01:45:31.037 --> 01:45:32.789
- So far as I know.
- Her grandfather ?

01:45:33.414 --> 01:45:36.334
He was one of our slaves.
Naturally, he was born on our land.

01:45:38.044 --> 01:45:40.463
- Is it over already ?
- It will be if I don't hurry.

01:45:40.755 --> 01:45:43.675
Where's the deed ?
The deed to this place, where is it?

01:45:44.008 --> 01:45:47.720
- Right where it's always been.
- They're really giving it to Reeve.

01:45:47.887 --> 01:45:50.014
Twisting every little thing
to Henry's advantage.

01:45:50.348 --> 01:45:51.975
They even got somebody to go
into the records

01:45:52.141 --> 01:45:53.851
and tear out the registration of his deed.

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:57.397
You didn't expect no different,
did you ? What do you want with this ?

01:45:57.522 --> 01:46:00.900
It's the only thing that can help Reeve.
Our deed confirms his.

01:46:01.276 --> 01:46:04.237
Have you gone plumb out of your
head ? You can't take this into court.

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:07.407
Got to. They get rid of him,
how do we know we ain't next?

01:46:07.615 --> 01:46:10.034
- Because we're white.
- This ain't about black and white.

01:46:10.243 --> 01:46:11.536
You think everybody feels like that ?

01:46:11.703 --> 01:46:13.830
Look, who cares what they feel ?
Give me the damn thing, will you ?

01:46:13.997 --> 01:46:16.416
- I'm not gonna let you do it. No.
- Give it to me.

01:46:16.833 --> 01:46:19.460
No, Rad ! Rad !

01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:51.576
No further questions.

01:46:51.784 --> 01:46:54.746
Now, I'd like to clear up one point,
Mrs. Warren.

01:46:54.913 --> 01:46:57.290
- These taxes the Scotts paid...
- Telephone call, Mr. Warren.

01:46:57.457 --> 01:46:59.334
Why did they pay taxes on your land ?

01:47:00.501 --> 01:47:04.505
Well my family felt they ought to pay
something, you know, in lieu of rent.

01:47:05.214 --> 01:47:07.467
Taxes was what they agreed on,
and I went along with that.

01:47:07.759 --> 01:47:09.469
Thank you. You may stand down.

01:47:10.511 --> 01:47:13.139
Hello, Cousin Henry ?
It's me, Charles.

01:47:13.264 --> 01:47:15.600
Now listen, my daddy's fixing to do
something terrible,

01:47:15.725 --> 01:47:17.060
and Mama can't stop him.

01:47:17.227 --> 01:47:18.770
Okay, Charles, I'll attend to it.

01:47:19.062 --> 01:47:22.106
You just go back home
as if nothing had happened.

01:47:24.359 --> 01:47:26.903
In other words, Your Honor,
the land in question

01:47:27.028 --> 01:47:31.532
was only loaned to Reeve Scott's
forbearers by the Colfax family

01:47:31.658 --> 01:47:34.827
during the war to keep it
out of Yankee hands.

01:47:35.119 --> 01:47:37.622
Now, this loan, under a verbal contract,

01:47:37.747 --> 01:47:40.541
has continued in effect
up to the present day.

01:47:40.708 --> 01:47:42.794
The Scott family has been
permitted to work it...

01:47:42.919 --> 01:47:46.256
Rad will be outside in two minutes.
I want you to go out there and stop him.

01:47:46.381 --> 01:47:49.008
You must stop him before
he gets inside the building.

01:47:49.133 --> 01:47:51.135
Let's get cracking.

01:48:06.067 --> 01:48:08.778
Doctor, it didn't hurt him any, did it?

01:48:17.036 --> 01:48:20.290
When are we gonna get
the results on all those tests ?

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.043
Yes, all right.

01:48:25.253 --> 01:48:26.963
Thank you, Doctor.

01:48:29.632 --> 01:48:31.676
Vivian, you know you're not allowed
in here.

01:48:31.843 --> 01:48:35.597
- I have to talk to you, Mrs. Warren.
- What about ?

01:48:35.763 --> 01:48:38.975
Won't you please give up
your claim to that land ?

01:48:39.392 --> 01:48:40.393
Why should I ?

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.021
That little bit of land
can't mean that much to you,

01:48:43.187 --> 01:48:46.649
but it's all Reeve has,
that farm is his whole life.

01:48:47.483 --> 01:48:50.236
Don't ask me to shed any tears
for Reeve Scott.

01:48:50.403 --> 01:48:53.072
- He nearly killed my boy.
- What?

01:48:54.324 --> 01:48:58.369
Yes, he set off dynamite
while Colie was in the line of fire.

01:48:58.536 --> 01:49:02.040
That's not true. Your little boy
wasn't anywhere near that place.

01:49:05.919 --> 01:49:08.296
Lying for Reeve
isn't going to help him, Vivian.

01:49:08.463 --> 01:49:10.465
lam not lying. I was there.

01:49:11.215 --> 01:49:13.676
Please, Vivian, get out of here.

01:49:13.843 --> 01:49:16.721
If your husband told you that,
then he's lying.

01:49:26.522 --> 01:49:28.733
I don't know why I did that.

01:49:31.152 --> 01:49:32.862
It doesn't matter.

01:49:34.822 --> 01:49:36.532
Please forgive me.

01:49:36.824 --> 01:49:39.410
I understand, believe me,
Mrs. Warren.

01:49:39.911 --> 01:49:42.121
I know exactly how you feel.

01:49:42.789 --> 01:49:44.666
You see, I've been where you're going.

01:49:45.667 --> 01:49:47.085
What are you talking about?

01:49:47.919 --> 01:49:51.422
What you said in court this morning,
and the way you acted just now.

01:49:51.839 --> 01:49:53.091
It's all a part of the same thing,

01:49:53.258 --> 01:49:55.301
he's turning you into something
just as bad as he is.

01:49:55.468 --> 01:49:57.095
- That's enough.
- All right.

01:49:57.262 --> 01:49:59.514
- But let me thank you first.
- What?

01:49:59.681 --> 01:50:01.724
You saved me from a big mistake.

01:50:01.891 --> 01:50:05.395
I was hooked on a guy in New York,
a guy exactly like your husband.

01:50:05.562 --> 01:50:07.272
- A white man ?
- No.

01:50:07.772 --> 01:50:10.608
You whites don't have a
monopoly on that kind of man.

01:50:10.775 --> 01:50:13.069
But in every other way,
they're like twins.

01:50:13.236 --> 01:50:15.572
Ambitious and ruthless.
Corrupting everyone...

01:50:15.738 --> 01:50:18.658
I won't let you talk about Henry
like that.

01:50:18.825 --> 01:50:21.661
Don't take my word for what
happened to your little boy.

01:50:21.828 --> 01:50:26.499
There were a hundred other people out
there, and you ask any one of them.

01:50:27.834 --> 01:50:31.504
Excuse me.
I'm in the wrong place.

01:50:34.549 --> 01:50:37.635
No, I'm not! You are!

01:50:38.469 --> 01:50:42.140
- Now what are you doing here ?
- Cleaning up.

01:50:46.561 --> 01:50:48.646
I swear to God I wish I'd let
you sell that place to Henry.

01:50:48.813 --> 01:50:50.523
I wish you'd given it away.

01:50:52.442 --> 01:50:54.736
I can just see all of us out in the cold.

01:50:54.903 --> 01:50:58.948
I can see Dolph and his hunt club
burning the roof over our heads.

01:50:59.741 --> 01:51:03.036
You know what happens to white
men who take up for colored.

01:51:08.249 --> 01:51:11.461
Think of the kids.
What's it gonna be like for them,

01:51:11.711 --> 01:51:15.340
growing up with all the other kids at
school hating them because of you ?

01:51:17.717 --> 01:51:21.638
Don't any of us matter?
Don't you care what happens to us ?

01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.358
Rad, please !

01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:36.736
You ain't going in there, Rad.

01:51:37.403 --> 01:51:38.738
Get out of my way, Dolph.

01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:49.540
Stop him! Stop him! Stop him!

01:51:57.173 --> 01:51:58.591
Son of a...

01:52:04.889 --> 01:52:07.183
Sheriff! Do something !

01:52:08.059 --> 01:52:09.686
Sheriff, please !

01:52:19.487 --> 01:52:22.574
I move that the claim of
Mrs. Julie Ann Colfax Warren

01:52:22.865 --> 01:52:25.159
to this property be set aside.

01:52:25.326 --> 01:52:26.828
Motion denied.

01:52:27.287 --> 01:52:30.081
I move that the claim of Reeve Scott

01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:33.793
for the property bequeathed him by his
mother be upheld by this court.

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:35.253
Denied.

01:52:35.503 --> 01:52:38.006
I move the true copy
of the deed of sale

01:52:38.172 --> 01:52:41.509
dated October 16th, 1866,
be recognized.

01:52:41.885 --> 01:52:44.804
- Motion denied.
- On what grounds, Your Honor?

01:52:44.971 --> 01:52:48.600
On what grounds ? Because the
scallywag who made out this document

01:52:48.766 --> 01:52:51.728
disgraced the flag and obviously
worked for the Yankees.

01:52:52.186 --> 01:52:54.397
And he barely knew
the first thing about writing.

01:52:54.772 --> 01:52:57.734
You can't even make out the name.
I mean, you call that a signature ?

01:52:57.901 --> 01:53:00.194
Looks like a whole lot of
chicken tracks to me.

01:53:00.987 --> 01:53:03.698
Now, despite the innuendos
of Mr. Sillens,

01:53:03.865 --> 01:53:06.284
we're still gonna send
this deed along to Atlanta

01:53:06.451 --> 01:53:11.080
and see if they can verify it.
But that may take a couple of months.

01:53:11.289 --> 01:53:15.043
And during that time, the court
shall appoint an administrator

01:53:15.209 --> 01:53:17.378
for the land in question.

01:53:17.962 --> 01:53:21.174
Mr. Henry Warren, would you be
willing to accept that job ?

01:53:21.507 --> 01:53:23.218
- Yes, Judge.
- Just a minute, Judge.

01:53:23.551 --> 01:53:26.804
- Who's that ?
- Rad McDowell, Judge.

01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:29.098
Have you something to add
to Mrs. Warren's case, Rad ?

01:53:29.432 --> 01:53:32.435
- Yes, sir.
- Why don't you step on up here then ?

01:53:34.103 --> 01:53:37.315
My own deed here proves that
the Scott deed is genuine.

01:53:37.482 --> 01:53:38.900
- What?
- See ?

01:53:39.192 --> 01:53:42.070
It says my place is bounded
by the river on one side,

01:53:42.528 --> 01:53:45.698
and by that certain tract belonging
to J.B. Scott on the other.

01:53:45.907 --> 01:53:48.743
- You sure this deed is correct?
- Positive.

01:53:49.911 --> 01:53:53.581
And see, on mine, you can make out
that scallywag's signature.

01:53:53.748 --> 01:53:57.585
Purcell, Vernon C. Purcell.
Same as your own name, Judge.

01:53:58.044 --> 01:53:59.921
Your granddaddy maybe ?

01:54:02.048 --> 01:54:05.301
Seems like I'm not the only one
with a family skeleton, Your Honor.

01:54:06.427 --> 01:54:07.428
Quiet.

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:10.348
Quiet, or I'll throw every last one
of you in jail.

01:54:11.057 --> 01:54:12.892
This document
doesn't change a thing.

01:54:13.059 --> 01:54:15.812
It's entirely outside the
relevant issues of this case.

01:54:16.271 --> 01:54:18.022
- Judge ?
- Yes, Miss Julie ?

01:54:19.399 --> 01:54:21.401
I'm withdrawing my claim
to that land.

01:54:22.026 --> 01:54:25.321
- It's Reeve's place, free and clear.
- Julie !

01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:26.990
Mr. Finchley, would you please have

01:54:27.156 --> 01:54:29.450
the necessary papers drawn up
for me to sign ?

01:54:35.873 --> 01:54:38.626
Quiet ! Quiet ! Quiet in here!

01:54:40.295 --> 01:54:42.005
Order in the courtroom!

01:54:48.386 --> 01:54:50.305
Julie! Julie!

01:55:01.024 --> 01:55:04.611
I want you to go home, and pack my
overnight bag, and bring it back here.

01:55:04.777 --> 01:55:06.738
What in the hell do you think
you were up to in court ?

01:55:06.988 --> 01:55:09.282
- Now you listen here...
- Keep your voice down.

01:55:09.449 --> 01:55:10.700
Sorry.

01:55:11.326 --> 01:55:14.245
Just bring me what I need for tonight.
I'll be around for the rest tomorrow.

01:55:14.412 --> 01:55:16.039
- Wait a minute, Kissie. What is this ?
- Go on.

01:55:16.205 --> 01:55:18.249
I asked you a question.

01:55:18.750 --> 01:55:23.004
- I'm moving in here with Colie.
- Why ? He ain't any worse, is he ?

01:55:23.379 --> 01:55:27.592
It's no use, Henry. I know
what really happened yesterday.

01:55:27.842 --> 01:55:29.552
I can explain all that.

01:55:29.719 --> 01:55:32.931
No more lies, Henry.
Just leave me alone.

01:55:33.097 --> 01:55:34.807
Now you wait a minute...

01:55:34.974 --> 01:55:36.476
You'll wake him up.

01:55:37.477 --> 01:55:40.730
I ain't leaving here till we've had
this thing out.

01:55:45.443 --> 01:55:48.112
- Now listen...
- No. You listen.

01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:56.371
The doctor just told me there's still a
chance that Colie can be cured.

01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:59.832
Soon as he's fit to travel,

01:55:59.999 --> 01:56:04.504
I'm gonna take him to the
Menninger Clinic in Topeka.

01:56:06.214 --> 01:56:11.344
And if they can't help him,
I'm gonna keep going until he's well.

01:56:13.179 --> 01:56:15.848
Or until there aren't any more
specialists to see.

01:56:16.015 --> 01:56:18.268
We ain't got the money for that.

01:56:18.851 --> 01:56:22.188
Now that you've handed that place
to Reeve on a silver platter,

01:56:22.355 --> 01:56:26.442
the whole deal with Riverside
will fall through. Including my job.

01:56:26.943 --> 01:56:28.903
I'm gonna put the house
on the market.

01:56:29.946 --> 01:56:32.532
And I'll sell my land
to the first bidder.

01:56:32.699 --> 01:56:34.492
Where we gonna live ?

01:56:35.285 --> 01:56:37.620
"We" aren't gonna live anywhere.

01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:41.833
- But we're married.
- For the moment.

01:56:47.213 --> 01:56:49.173
It can't end like this.

01:56:50.967 --> 01:56:57.098
Please. This is too important a thing
to decide in the heat of an argument.

01:56:59.017 --> 01:57:00.727
I love you, Julie.

01:57:02.103 --> 01:57:03.479
I need you.

01:57:04.439 --> 01:57:06.232
I can't make it without you.

01:57:08.109 --> 01:57:14.282
Please. Don't throw away six years
of our lives for one moment of anger.

01:57:15.992 --> 01:57:17.827
I'm not angry, Henry.

01:57:18.453 --> 01:57:20.955
If I were, there might be
some hope for us.

01:57:22.749 --> 01:57:25.293
I love you.
And I know you love me.

01:57:38.223 --> 01:57:41.267
Just give us a few minutes alone.

01:57:42.018 --> 01:57:45.688
- We'll have those fires blazing again.
- It won't work, Henry.

01:57:48.983 --> 01:57:50.443
It won't work ?

01:57:53.029 --> 01:57:55.031
You're feeling something right now.

01:57:57.325 --> 01:58:00.245
That same old itch we
always give each other.

01:58:01.496 --> 01:58:04.958
Don't. It makes my skin crawl.

01:58:14.092 --> 01:58:15.760
You snotty bitch.

01:58:17.637 --> 01:58:21.224
Where do you get off being
so goddamned high and mighty ?

01:58:23.059 --> 01:58:25.895
I want you moved out
by the end of the week.

01:58:27.397 --> 01:58:29.857
So they can start showing the house.

01:58:32.110 --> 01:58:34.404
And where am I supposed to go ?

01:58:35.613 --> 01:58:37.490
Back to the shrimp boats.

01:58:37.949 --> 01:58:39.784
Or anywhere you like.

01:58:45.999 --> 01:58:47.542
Open this door.

01:58:49.252 --> 01:58:51.588
You got the keys to my car.

01:59:43.223 --> 01:59:44.682
Cousin Henry ?

01:59:48.394 --> 01:59:50.730
What you doing here
this time of night ?

01:59:50.897 --> 01:59:52.565
I'm running away.

01:59:54.692 --> 01:59:58.821
Just go on home.
Act like nothing happened.

02:00:00.156 --> 02:00:02.659
They don't know you tipped me off.

02:00:02.825 --> 02:00:06.037
Don't make me go back. Please.

02:00:35.233 --> 02:00:37.110
- Who's there ?
- It's me.

02:00:46.911 --> 02:00:48.621
Miss your train to New York ?

02:00:49.497 --> 02:00:51.708
I changed my mind about going.

02:00:52.834 --> 02:00:54.377
May I come in ?

02:00:59.215 --> 02:01:02.343
I decided to stick around.
Protect my investment.

02:01:03.595 --> 02:01:08.016
I stuck my neck out at least three miles
to help you save this place.

02:01:08.141 --> 02:01:11.477
Why should I run off and let it all
fall into some other girl's lap ?

02:01:14.105 --> 02:01:15.982
I'm moving in.

02:01:21.821 --> 02:01:25.033
Reeve, I can't think of
any more clever things to say.

02:01:28.995 --> 02:01:30.413
I love you.

02:01:32.749 --> 02:01:34.083
Only you.

02:01:55.855 --> 02:01:58.149
- Hi, what's up ?
- Charles is missing.

02:01:58.274 --> 02:02:01.027
Lou and I are going to look for him.
Will you take care of the others ?

02:02:01.152 --> 02:02:03.821
- Sure. Come on, boys.
- Have they had supper yet ?

02:02:03.947 --> 02:02:06.491
- Yes, they have.
- Well, don't worry about them.

02:02:06.616 --> 02:02:08.034
Thank you.

02:02:20.922 --> 02:02:26.094
If I'd have stuck with this instead
of letting myself get sidetracked,

02:02:29.389 --> 02:02:31.975
I'd have been right on top by now.

02:02:33.351 --> 02:02:35.144
Have my own band...

02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.023
Everything.

02:02:46.489 --> 02:02:48.324
I could still do it.

02:02:57.917 --> 02:02:59.961
Nothing to keep me here.

02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:07.010
Maybe I'll just take off.

02:03:12.223 --> 02:03:14.100
Head for California.

02:03:16.227 --> 02:03:18.062
You know, Charles...

02:03:24.652 --> 02:03:27.864
There ain't a dream been dreamed
can't come true out there.

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:36.331
I tell you,
California is the coming thing.

02:03:38.875 --> 02:03:45.924
A man can make whatever
he wants of himself out there.

02:03:59.103 --> 02:04:00.605
God damn it !

02:04:02.690 --> 02:04:04.234
I'll do it.

02:04:10.573 --> 02:04:12.742
I wish I was your son.

02:04:18.706 --> 02:04:21.626
- Why ?
- So's I could go with you.

02:04:35.306 --> 02:04:37.767
Couldn't you, maybe,
take me anyway ?

02:04:39.227 --> 02:04:40.395
Please.

02:04:41.813 --> 02:04:44.023
I don't cost too much to feed.

02:04:44.941 --> 02:04:46.943
Never worry about money.

02:04:48.236 --> 02:04:50.238
I can always get money.

02:04:53.324 --> 02:04:55.368
You mean you'll take me ?

02:05:01.874 --> 02:05:03.126
Why not?

02:05:26.232 --> 02:05:30.361
Sheriff? Sorry to interrupt you here,
but your office was closed.

02:05:30.486 --> 02:05:33.281
- Something wrong ?
- It's my boy, Charles. He's missing.

02:05:33.489 --> 02:05:35.158
- What you mean "missing"?
- Just that.

02:05:35.325 --> 02:05:37.535
Nobody's seen him since early
this afternoon.

02:05:37.702 --> 02:05:39.203
He'll turn up.

02:05:40.538 --> 02:05:43.041
Chalmer, the boy is missing.

02:05:43.207 --> 02:05:46.502
Now I expect you to do something
about it. It's your job.

02:05:46.669 --> 02:05:48.504
Don't you preach to me
about law and order.

02:05:48.671 --> 02:05:51.090
- Not after what you've done.
- Sheriff, please.

02:05:51.883 --> 02:05:53.927
Maybe something happened to him.
Maybe somebody...

02:05:54.093 --> 02:05:56.804
Maybe you should've thought
about that a little sooner.

02:05:56.971 --> 02:06:00.266
- Please, Mr. Coombs.
- Okay, okay, don't get excited.

02:06:00.433 --> 02:06:03.269
Nobody gonna do anything to him.
Why should they ?

02:06:03.436 --> 02:06:06.814
He's the one that told us
what you was aiming to do.

02:06:09.234 --> 02:06:10.985
I'll show you, boy.

02:06:16.074 --> 02:06:17.951
Wonderful, honey.

02:07:32.233 --> 02:07:35.111
- See if the house doesn't get him.
- One more ?

02:07:43.202 --> 02:07:47.290
Yeah. Hi, Henry.

02:07:48.249 --> 02:07:50.043
Just hanging around.

02:07:51.127 --> 02:07:52.253
What?

02:07:53.254 --> 02:07:56.257
Yeah. Yeah.

02:07:57.467 --> 02:07:59.802
Sure thing. Sounds like fun.

02:08:00.178 --> 02:08:02.513
I'll meet you out at Riverside.

02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:49.852
- Mr. Warren ain't home.
- We're looking for our little boy.

02:08:52.605 --> 02:08:55.191
Charles. Charles.

02:08:56.150 --> 02:08:58.361
You scared us half to death.

02:09:02.615 --> 02:09:04.909
- Where's Cousin Henry ?
- What have you been up to, Charles ?

02:09:05.076 --> 02:09:06.953
Running away from home.

02:09:08.705 --> 02:09:11.541
Because you told Cousin Henry
I was fixing to help Reeve.

02:09:12.083 --> 02:09:13.543
Don't hit me.

02:09:14.002 --> 02:09:18.047
I ain't gonna hit you.
Don't be afraid of me, Charles.

02:09:18.256 --> 02:09:21.301
Whatever you do, I'll try to understand.
Try to help you.

02:09:22.844 --> 02:09:25.430
- Can't we talk this out at home ?
- No! I wish you'd never come back!

02:09:25.555 --> 02:09:28.892
I wish you'd have got killed in the war,
you goddamned nigger-lover!

02:09:29.225 --> 02:09:30.977
Don't, Rad, please !

02:09:33.187 --> 02:09:35.857
Now, I don't care what you think of me,
I'm still your father,

02:09:36.190 --> 02:09:39.068
and I aim to see that
you do what's right.

02:10:27.533 --> 02:10:29.577
Good night and thank you.

02:12:51.469 --> 02:12:53.346
What time you want it to go off?

02:12:54.514 --> 02:12:57.892
- An hour from now it'd be all right.
- No, make it 5:00.

02:12:58.268 --> 02:13:02.021
Okay, we all wanna be home in bed
when things start to pop.

02:13:39.934 --> 02:13:42.687
Charles ? You up there ?

02:14:02.290 --> 02:14:04.876
Wake up, damn it.

02:14:05.001 --> 02:14:08.630
- Something wrong ?
- Where's Charles ? Charles McDowell ?

02:14:09.088 --> 02:14:11.799
Guess he went back home
with his mom and daddy.

02:14:11.925 --> 02:14:16.262
- What are you talking about?
- His mom and daddy came for him.

02:14:35.198 --> 02:14:37.617
- Yeah ?
- Dolph, it's me, Henry.

02:14:37.909 --> 02:14:39.661
We've gotta stop this thing right away.

02:14:39.786 --> 02:14:42.205
- The hell you say ?
- No, listen, listen.

02:14:42.747 --> 02:14:44.499
Charles ain't here like I thought!

02:14:44.749 --> 02:14:46.543
He's out there. He went back home.

02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:49.212
Good. The more the merrier.

02:14:51.005 --> 02:14:55.635
No, it's too late to do anything now
except get ourselves blown up, Henry.

02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:57.262
<i>- Good night.
- No, no...</i>

02:15:37.093 --> 02:15:38.595
Cousin Henry !

02:15:43.683 --> 02:15:46.102
Come on, Charles, run like hell!

02:15:46.728 --> 02:15:48.021
Come on !

02:15:55.820 --> 02:15:57.238
- Come on, Charles.
- No !

02:15:57.363 --> 02:15:59.574
- All hell's gonna...
- No !

02:15:59.866 --> 02:16:02.035
Outside, everybody ! Quick!

02:16:02.952 --> 02:16:05.163
Come on, now !
Head for Reeve's place !

02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:08.458
Run as fast as you can ! Don't stop for
nothing ! Come on, now, move!

02:16:14.964 --> 02:16:20.011
- Charles ! Where's Charles ?
- I'll find him ! You go on!

02:16:21.512 --> 02:16:24.390
Charles, all hell's gonna break loose
in a minute !

02:16:24.807 --> 02:16:26.142
Do you want to get killed ?

02:16:26.351 --> 02:16:27.602
Charles !

02:17:55.815 --> 02:17:57.483
Charles ?

02:18:03.865 --> 02:18:05.950
He got hit running back to Rad.

02:18:23.009 --> 02:18:24.135
No.

02:18:34.938 --> 02:18:36.397
I killed him.

02:18:36.731 --> 02:18:39.066
Just as much as if I'd put a bullet
in his head.

02:18:41.611 --> 02:18:43.111
- No.
- If I hadn't gone into court,

02:18:43.279 --> 02:18:44.822
he'd still be alive.

02:18:45.823 --> 02:18:47.532
- They was only getting even with me.
- No.

02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:50.411
- Just like you said they would.
- No, you done right.

02:18:50.954 --> 02:18:52.746
I understand that now.

02:18:52.914 --> 02:18:56.584
The last thing I ever done for Charles
was to hit him.

02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:58.795
He was running to you, not away.

02:18:59.003 --> 02:19:01.714
So he must've known how you really felt.

02:19:02.715 --> 02:19:03.841
Lou.

02:19:12.976 --> 02:19:14.519
I know, I know.

02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:32.662
Come on, boys.

02:19:41.671 --> 02:19:43.464
Looks like Henry's won after all.

02:19:43.630 --> 02:19:46.300
Only if we let him. We can still hold on.

02:19:46.718 --> 02:19:49.554
You can, maybe. My place is gone.

02:19:49.762 --> 02:19:51.806
Well, we got this place.
We can work it together.

02:19:51.973 --> 02:19:54.309
And we'll work to get
your place back in shape.

02:19:54.934 --> 02:19:56.436
That's a couple of years away.

02:19:56.603 --> 02:19:59.355
So what?
We're young, we got time.

02:20:01.024 --> 02:20:04.402
I'm sorry, Rad.
We've all come to help you.

02:20:07.113 --> 02:20:08.114
Come on.

02:20:08.323 --> 02:20:10.366
Don't give her this stuff.

02:20:23.421 --> 02:20:26.341
That Henry Warren, already on the job.

02:20:28.801 --> 02:20:31.512
That mess is sure gonna
cost Riverside a pretty penny.

02:20:32.055 --> 02:20:36.768
I will never again sell dynamite to a man
that don't know how to handle it.

02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:39.687
Or a nigger.
There ought to be a law against it.
