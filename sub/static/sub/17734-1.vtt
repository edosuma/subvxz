00:33.066 --> 00:36.135
<i>Some people say luck...</i>

00:36.236 --> 00:38.668
<i>ain't nothing but karma
in work clothes.</i>

00:40.140 --> 00:42.265
<i>Cause and effect.</i>

00:42.375 --> 00:44.067
You'll get us killed, motherfucker.

00:44.177 --> 00:45.642
You get the fuck out of my car.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.472
This is my car. Hell, no!

00:47.580 --> 00:48.942
What are you, on crack?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.316
Stop the fucking car!

00:53.720 --> 00:55.651
Look, now get out and let me drive!

00:55.755 --> 00:57.823
Get out!

01:02.829 --> 01:05.193
Oh, yeah. You have
to go to a hospital.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.460
<i>Yeah, you're wondering, how
the fuck did I get here?</i>

01:14.574 --> 01:16.665
<i>I made some bad choices.</i>

01:18.645 --> 01:22.078
<i>If it hadn't been for prison,
I never would've met Philomene.</i>

01:22.182 --> 01:23.840
Knowledge is power.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.385
<i>I'm Cape Verdean.</i>

01:27.554 --> 01:30.179
<i>Got me expanding my horizons.</i>

01:31.390 --> 01:34.585
<i>Classic falling-for-your-
caseworker, you know.</i>

01:34.694 --> 01:37.820
<i>Philomene wasn't having it or me.</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:42.468
<i>All I could do was
read and watch movies.</i>

01:42.569 --> 01:46.105
<i>Anything but gangster flicks.</i>

01:46.206 --> 01:48.274
<i>This shit reminded me
too much of my past.</i>

01:52.579 --> 01:56.240
<i>And I was determined to
make sure my past...</i>

01:57.050 --> 01:59.675
<i>would not be my future.</i>

02:04.491 --> 02:06.923
<i>You know, I worked odd jobs...</i>

02:07.026 --> 02:11.085
<i>and Philomene finally
took me seriously.</i>

02:11.598 --> 02:16.226
<i>And we put what we had together,
bought a nice little place down south.</i>

02:16.336 --> 02:20.566
<i>And as luck would have it,
she couldn't have kids.</i>

02:21.107 --> 02:24.370
<i>So we got a dog.</i>

02:24.477 --> 02:26.374
<i>She wanted to name
him Lucky, after me.</i>

02:26.478 --> 02:30.345
<i>I said, hell, no.
Give the mutt a chance.</i>

02:30.450 --> 02:33.986
<i>We called him Scraps.</i>

02:34.087 --> 02:38.419
<i>For a moment, I thought my
luck might have changed.</i>

02:39.392 --> 02:40.959
<i>Now, ain't that a bitch?</i>

02:41.060 --> 02:45.597
<i>All the bullets I done caught over
the years and I get diverticulitis.</i>

02:45.698 --> 02:48.096
<i>They said they had to
operate right away.</i>

02:48.567 --> 02:51.159
<i>Maybe luck is a matter of timing.</i>

02:52.572 --> 02:54.606
<i>When I woke up...</i>

02:55.041 --> 02:58.133
<i>seemed like time had
run out on all of us.</i>

02:58.244 --> 03:00.312
Anybody down here?

03:05.718 --> 03:09.379
Shit. What the fuck is going on?

03:12.158 --> 03:14.522
<i>At first, I thought the rapture
had come and... and...</i>

03:14.627 --> 03:17.525
<i>Like those end-of-the-days preachers
are always talking about.</i>

03:17.630 --> 03:22.258
<i>And J.C., he had come down and
taken everybody except me.</i>

03:23.069 --> 03:24.761
Hello?

03:25.538 --> 03:26.969
- Hey, come here, boy.
- <i>I repeat:</i>

03:27.073 --> 03:29.334
- Come here.
- <i>This has been a class-five hurricane.</i>

03:29.442 --> 03:32.102
- Yeah, Pops.
- <i>Hurricane Katrina, class-five.</i>

03:32.212 --> 03:33.939
<i>Authorities are now
urging everyone...</i>

03:34.047 --> 03:36.547
<i>to make their way immediately
to the Superdome.</i>

03:36.649 --> 03:40.344
Don't you trust them. Don't go.

03:40.853 --> 03:41.920
Don't go.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.282
<i>We are told that the National
Guard is on its way.</i>

03:44.390 --> 03:48.426
<i>But we have conflicting reports
as to when that will be.</i>

03:51.631 --> 03:53.790
<i>Maybe Mother Nature...</i>

03:53.900 --> 03:57.936
<i>was trying to give us
one last wake-up call.</i>

04:00.607 --> 04:02.504
<i>Or...</i>

04:02.609 --> 04:05.769
<i>maybe it's like my grandpa said:</i>

04:05.878 --> 04:09.744
<i>"If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all."</i>

04:09.849 --> 04:11.382
<i>Say, hi, Daddy.</i>

04:11.484 --> 04:15.748
<i>No Philomene, no Scraps...</i>

04:16.422 --> 04:17.749
<i>no house.</i>

04:17.856 --> 04:19.446
Freeze.

04:19.559 --> 04:20.819
Roger. Another looter.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.722
Ninth ward, Sector 8.

04:22.829 --> 04:25.557
<i>Situation, Main and
Parrish, request backup.</i>

04:25.665 --> 04:27.665
I'm on it.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.606
<i>Two years ago, Hurricane
Katrina underscored...</i>

04:37.076 --> 04:40.373
<i>the deep economic and class divide
that still exists in this country.</i>

04:40.480 --> 04:45.779
<i>I figured I could be another brother
waving for help from a rooftop...</i>

04:46.019 --> 04:49.555
<i>or take my ass back to New York.</i>

04:49.656 --> 04:52.418
<i>It ain't easy being
king of the city.</i>

04:56.029 --> 04:58.154
I've got that book.
Holiday cheer, right here.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.626
I got what you need.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.026
Look, a black reindeer.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.635
I got that for you. I've got watches.
I've got your Kwanzaa needs.

05:04.737 --> 05:07.237
I've got your Hanukkah needs.
I've got what you need.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.271
I've got the ties.
I've got the coats.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.375
I've got some panties.
Anybody need panties?

05:11.477 --> 05:12.942
- I've got panties.
- Ain't that what's-his-name?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.545
Used to run 135th Street?

05:14.647 --> 05:17.375
Hell, no, that ain't him right
there, man, you bugging.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.380
- That's him, son.
- He died a while back.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.847
He got popped for no telling.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.350
- We out of here, man.
- You too.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.785
Look at them, I got the
glasses for you now, baby.

05:24.891 --> 05:28.722
You know what I'm saying?
You can see how it goes down.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.286
All right, beautiful, right?
I've got them.

05:31.397 --> 05:33.863
Two for 5. Two for 5.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.687
- <i>How's this?</i>
- Better.

06:02.328 --> 06:04.862
Oh, whoa, okay, hey, hey. Cass?

06:04.964 --> 06:08.295
Would you watch it with the 1 K,
because you're flaring me out here?

06:08.401 --> 06:12.301
<i>Could you be a little louder?
I wanna go deaf, like Pete Townshend.</i>

06:12.405 --> 06:15.372
I told you not to point it
directly at the camera.

06:15.475 --> 06:18.544
<i>Pardon me if I'm not up to the
standards of your professionalism.</i>

06:18.644 --> 06:22.043
Okay. Just pan the 650
15 degrees to the left.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.442
<i>My left or camera left?</i>

06:23.549 --> 06:26.516
No, it's always left cam...
Camera left, Cass.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.950
It's not really that hard to remember.
Stage right, camera left.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.124
<i>Okay.</i>

06:32.225 --> 06:37.126
<i>So this is one of those days
when I can't do anything right.</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:39.855
<i>Love is when you...</i>

06:39.966 --> 06:43.557
<i>and all the fucked-up shit
you ever did in your life...</i>

06:43.970 --> 06:47.301
<i>and the fucked-up shit that you're
probably gonna do in your life...</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:50.101
<i>and every little thing that
you could possibly think...</i>

06:50.209 --> 06:53.676
<i>that would embarrass the living shit
out of you on any day of the week...</i>

06:53.780 --> 06:56.178
<i>to any other person on the
face of the universe...</i>

06:56.282 --> 06:59.476
<i>but to this one special woman.</i>

07:00.052 --> 07:02.086
<i>She takes it all.</i>

07:02.188 --> 07:04.848
<i>And she kisses the
feet you walk on...</i>

07:04.957 --> 07:07.924
<i>without judgment, without anything.</i>

07:08.027 --> 07:13.531
<i>Someone that you know that you
can shit, fuck, piss, crap, cry.</i>

07:13.633 --> 07:16.258
<i>All of that, you know.
That's what love is, now.</i>

07:16.369 --> 07:19.267
<i>You know, or kind of like going on
an odyssey. Know what I mean?</i>

07:19.372 --> 07:21.770
<i>It's like a fantasy voyage
or something, you know?</i>

07:21.874 --> 07:25.102
<i>And, like, I'm like
James T. Kirk...</i>

07:25.211 --> 07:28.576
<i>and she's like Princess Leia
or something, I don't know.</i>

07:28.681 --> 07:34.083
<i>And, like, we're going where no
couple has ever gone before.</i>

07:35.455 --> 07:38.115
Hey, Lucky. Hey, man, what's up?

07:38.224 --> 07:40.315
Yo, open the door. I'm coming in.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.068
- What's up, baby?
- What's up?

07:50.169 --> 07:52.499
- Fo' shizzle, my nizzle.
- What's up, dog?

07:56.742 --> 07:59.037
Yo, man, when you gonna
teach your man to talk?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.906
- All right, man.
- Yeah, he's all right.

08:01.013 --> 08:04.048
You only saying that because
you're on his payroll.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.779
What you got there?

08:06.886 --> 08:11.082
Well, can't have my employee of the month
rolling up to my birthday party...

08:11.190 --> 08:13.884
wearing some
Swahili-Afro-boogie bullshit.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.323
Shit. I'm not your employee.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.497
My bad. My top associate.

08:18.598 --> 08:19.858
Got to represent, you know?

08:19.966 --> 08:21.829
Better not be that
fantasy pimp shit...

08:21.934 --> 08:24.798
- ...that you like wearing.
- No, baby. Tasteful.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.268
I got Sean John, a.k.a. P. Dizzle.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.668
- It's nice.
- Well, can a brother get a thank-you?

08:29.775 --> 08:33.275
"Well, yeah. Well, thank
you, my Hebrew homes."

08:35.414 --> 08:37.106
Afro Hip Hop Youth Day?

08:37.216 --> 08:38.976
What the fuck you
do with my printer?

08:39.085 --> 08:41.948
Yo, well, just consider it like
your donation to the community.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.990
Hey. Hey, the ink
is expensive, man.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.750
Yo, let's get to business.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.329
All right. All right.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.395
I got the latest
diamond-encrusted Rolex.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.829
I got the new, gold,
baller necklace.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.503
Don't wear that too long.
Your neck will turn green.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.604
I got some sunglasses, some Rays.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.740
- I got everything in here, man.
- Sol.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.502
- What's up?
- Why you do this shit, man?

09:05.611 --> 09:09.078
- What do you mean?
- What I mean, your family got paper.

09:09.181 --> 09:12.648
Your uncle owns the jewelry store.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.946
You're robbing your uncle.

09:16.656 --> 09:20.419
Why you do this?
What do you do this for?

09:20.526 --> 09:22.560
Why did you do it?

09:22.662 --> 09:26.664
I mean, you were one of the
biggest hustlers in Harlem, man.

09:26.766 --> 09:29.198
Mr. Untouchable?

09:29.302 --> 09:32.132
Hey, you was poisoning
your own people.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.330
- Yo.
- Yo. No offense, bro.

09:35.441 --> 09:39.136
I mean, it's the American way, right?
We all want more.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.313
Even Donald fucking
Trump wants more.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.415
More... More power,
more money, more bling.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.982
More punani.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.621
Yo, listen, it's real important to me
that you be on time tonight, you know?

09:49.722 --> 09:52.086
- I'll send the fellas.
- I want to talk about that.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.158
- What's up?
- I'm not gonna be able to roll, man.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.592
- What are you talking about, man?
- You know, that's your thing, man.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.824
- I ain't...
- Oh, but it's my birthday party, man.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.331
We'll have a crazy time, son.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.266
Look, I got all this shit for you.
You're gonna love it, man.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.905
That's you, right there.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.598
- I get to wear this?
- Yes, you get to wear this.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.269
I don't know, man. I don't know.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.549
No, man. That's your world.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.277
This is my size.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.545
- He likes it, he likes it.
- Yeah, baby.

10:22.655 --> 10:26.851
She starts screwing around and has
no idea whose kid she's having.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.356
Well, that's how she sees it.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.994
- Don't get knocked up.
- Excuse me.

10:30.096 --> 10:33.097
- Can you help me?
- Just saying, it's not fair to the kids.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.993
Got it.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.196
I'm going back in for
the picnic table.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.735
Hey, babe. Smile for the camera.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.207
- You know how we do.
- Oh, yeah.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.609
So you tell them about what we're
gonna do later on. All right?

11:26.585 --> 11:28.243
I think they ready, sir.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.252
Oh, yeah. They ready.
You see that today?

11:32.758 --> 11:34.155
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.828
Hey, look, Mr. C., about
those flyers and everything?

11:36.929 --> 11:39.156
Ain't gotta worry about that.
I got that for free.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.128
My man hooked me up
and everything...

11:41.233 --> 11:43.062
Beautiful.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.903
You'd think by now that
people would understand...

11:48.007 --> 11:49.802
that you reap what you sow.

11:51.277 --> 11:55.336
Would you rather have your kids
in a dance group or a gang?

11:55.448 --> 11:58.779
Dance group. Without question.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.442
It seems the government's more
interested in building prisons...

12:02.555 --> 12:04.316
than investing in the kids.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.949
This is gonna be our last show.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.994
They've taken away our funding,
so we've gotta close the place down.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.866
Yeah, I know.

12:20.973 --> 12:24.565
But don't you let this unravel
all the good work you've done.

12:25.344 --> 12:28.413
For this place, for these kids.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.809
Most of all, for yourself.

12:31.817 --> 12:34.408
You've turned your life around.

12:34.987 --> 12:37.681
You stayed on the path.

12:38.924 --> 12:42.015
I was really looking
forward to this, you know?

12:43.529 --> 12:45.494
Really looking forward to it.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.260
All right, Mr. C.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.771
Good luck to you, young brother.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.635
Hey, you know how we do.

12:56.742 --> 13:00.403
We're in the trenches,
baby. In the trenches.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.689
The bitches in this piece.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.953
Sir, you're here with
the Rosenbaum's party.

13:17.062 --> 13:18.459
Right this way, sir.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.928
<i>Putting it down. New Booty
Room, to your right.</i>

13:21.033 --> 13:23.260
<i>We got the Oom-Boom Room.</i>

13:24.703 --> 13:27.465
<i>We've got lap dances for $25.</i>

<i>30, if you're a good tipper.</i>

13:29.141 --> 13:30.606
<i>And on the stage right now...</i>

13:30.709 --> 13:33.505
<i>we got Carmen, all
the way from Cuba.</i>

13:33.612 --> 13:35.270
<i>You gotta love Castro.</i>

13:35.381 --> 13:37.745
<i>She swam over here for
you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

13:37.850 --> 13:39.975
<i>You know what? We gotta
pay for that education.</i>

13:40.085 --> 13:43.245
<i>Go in your pockets.
No food stamps. No coin.</i>

13:43.355 --> 13:44.945
<i>Just stuff that folds.</i>

13:45.057 --> 13:46.920
<i>Carmen putting it down for you.</i>

13:47.026 --> 13:50.459
<i>Right here in The Cadillac Lounge.
This is DJ Big Cat.</i>

14:00.940 --> 14:02.735
Yeah, go on, girl.
Get triple-X with it.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.136
Money to share.

14:04.243 --> 14:07.972
Oh, shit. Yeah. What's up, dog?

14:08.247 --> 14:11.145
Come on, you gotta admit it.
I'm as pretty as new money, right?

14:11.250 --> 14:12.942
You look like Tony
Montana on crack.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.847
Yeah. Well, you would know.

14:14.954 --> 14:16.316
- What's up?
- Happy birthday.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.581
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.055
- I dressed you well. Look at you.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.091
Very nice. Very nice. Let's drink.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.058
Oh, shit. You know what time it is?

14:25.164 --> 14:28.529
It's time for some more
Cristal in this bitch.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.870
Happy birthday toast
to the birthday boy.

14:52.925 --> 14:56.256
So, basically, what's your flavor?

14:56.362 --> 15:03.334
You know, you like vanilla,
chocolate, mocha? Some swirl?

15:03.435 --> 15:05.765
No plastic.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.461
- No plastic.
- Oh, okay.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.107
All right. Brothers like some
genuine junk in the trunk.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.174
I know, I know.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.007
Yo.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.909
Carmen.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.107
Don't you pretend you
don't know me. It's me.

15:19.218 --> 15:22.310
You know, excuse me,
Benjamin Franklin?

15:22.421 --> 15:25.957
You know, come on. See,
my associate over here...

15:26.058 --> 15:27.523
he ain't never been to Cuba.

15:27.626 --> 15:31.628
Why don't you take him
all the way to C-U-B-A?

15:32.398 --> 15:34.398
Everybody hold their positions.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.696
- We move on my command.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

15:47.713 --> 15:50.043
<i>I'm in love with a stripper.</i>

15:50.149 --> 15:53.047
<i>I'm in love with a stripper,
that's why I'm working here.</i>

15:54.687 --> 15:56.049
Oh, yeah.

15:56.155 --> 15:59.122
That's him right there.
In the black suit.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.721
Bonus.

16:27.453 --> 16:28.918
You can hold my stick too.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.850
You wish.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.902
I thought she liked me.

16:46.705 --> 16:52.937
I mean, baby got ass like
a Shetland pony. Right.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.479
Lucky.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.184
- I want you to meet the owner.
- Why?

17:00.285 --> 17:03.218
Well, you know, he's just a friend.
You know, like that.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.285
No, come on, yo. It's...

17:07.393 --> 17:10.189
I mean, you know, make me
look good here, you know?

17:10.295 --> 17:12.794
- It's my birthday. Come on.
- Make you look good?

17:12.896 --> 17:14.555
- Yeah.
- Dude...

17:14.665 --> 17:19.260
I got... I got a little
deal here, okay?

17:19.371 --> 17:22.064
You know, I figure with
you here, you know...

17:22.174 --> 17:24.969
everything goes right, you know?
Who's gonna mess with me?

17:25.077 --> 17:27.145
Mess with you? Why don't
you take your boys?

17:27.246 --> 17:29.746
Oh, come on, man. Be serious.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.609
Listen, Lucky, okay?

17:31.717 --> 17:33.444
I'm in deep here, you know?

17:33.919 --> 17:38.718
So, come on, just, I'm not
telling nothing, okay?

17:38.824 --> 17:41.859
Please, Lucky. Come on. You know?

17:41.960 --> 17:43.755
Who's getting you back
on your feet? Me.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.429
Who trusted you when no one would?

17:45.531 --> 17:47.724
Me, okay? Now help me.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.766
Okay, you don't gotta say nothing
or you don't gotta do nothing.

17:50.869 --> 17:53.529
Just stand there.
Just be there with me.

17:53.639 --> 17:57.607
Okay? Please.
Just this once, all right?

17:58.577 --> 18:01.237
- What do you say?
- Oh, man.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.773
Look who it is.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.737
Now I believe in reincarnation.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.535
Holy shit, I thought you were dead.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.678
Yeah, well, so did I.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.245
Come here, man.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.918
- Keeping it together?
- I am, I am, I am.

18:41.019 --> 18:44.577
Gentlemen, I believe we have
some business to transact.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.417
Jesus. Fifteen years?

18:46.525 --> 18:48.183
- Lucky, please stay.
- Yo, man.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.917
Don't let me interrupt.
Handle bu...

18:50.028 --> 18:51.390
- Have a seat.
- I'm just...

18:51.497 --> 18:53.030
Please. Join us.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.401
You need something, baby?

19:04.343 --> 19:06.638
As requested.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.409
250 thousand dollars.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.850
Each case.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.785
Hey.

19:15.921 --> 19:18.581
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lucky.
Lucky, Lucky, please stay.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.883
- I'm just gonna take a piss, baby.
- No, no, no.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.153
You're my guest. Please. We're gonna
have a little drink here, please.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.661
Sit, sit, sit. Please.

19:31.236 --> 19:34.134
You gotta teach your pet
Jew boy some manners.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.101
Now, I showed you mine.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.476
Four cases, 100 per crate.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.311
The minivan's parked out back.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.014
Beretta Cheetah.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.850
Magazine capacity...

19:52.958 --> 19:54.685
thirteen, as requested.

19:55.661 --> 19:58.252
- Let's get out of here, man.
- What?

20:01.333 --> 20:02.866
Jenny, how about some champagne?

20:02.968 --> 20:04.035
He's a rat.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.430
Let's get out of here,
man. Come on.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.203
Yo. Sorry, homeboy.
You know how it is.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.142
Gots to get paid.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.049
Everybody hold until
we confirm the goods.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.880
<i>Roger.</i>

20:42.407 --> 20:45.101
- <i>Yeah, the Berettas look good.</i>
- The merchandise checks out.

20:45.210 --> 20:49.576
Bravo. Bravo. Successful
business transaction.

20:49.681 --> 20:50.975
<i>Police! You're under arrest!</i>

20:51.083 --> 20:53.310
The guest of honor
should do the honors.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.815
For old times' sake.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.588
Yeah, that's a good idea.
No problem.

21:00.959 --> 21:02.424
You never cease to amaze me.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.686
Oh, I try not to, baby.

21:04.896 --> 21:08.056
- Big baller.
- It's good to see you, my man.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.528
Yeah, yeah.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.896
- Back in the life.
- No, no, no. Not me.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.800
- No?
- I'm just a hostess.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.002
- There you go.
- Gino, why don't you go ahead?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.271
Wrap up things outside.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.338
Hey, hey!

21:27.619 --> 21:29.949
- What the fuck you doing, man?
- What am I doing?

21:30.055 --> 21:33.784
Oh, shit! Oh, my God! He's got
a fucking wire! Oh, my God!

21:50.208 --> 21:53.744
<i>There comes a point in life when
you just gotta say, "Fuck it."</i>

21:55.414 --> 21:57.675
<i>You gotta play the hand
that life deals you...</i>

21:57.783 --> 22:01.512
<i>and let the chips
fall where they may.</i>

22:04.756 --> 22:06.050
Don't shoot!

22:12.698 --> 22:14.288
Where's my fucking money?

22:15.534 --> 22:18.467
Who is that? Whose fucking
red Mustang is that?

22:18.570 --> 22:20.399
The Latin chick. Carmen.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.095
She goes by the name Carmen.

22:22.207 --> 22:25.708
Telling you now, you piece of shit,
I go down, you're going down with me.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.276
Move out, let's go!

22:27.379 --> 22:29.709
- What the fuck is going on?
- Get on the ground.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.281
- What are you, fucking crazy?
- Get down on the ground.

22:41.393 --> 22:44.155
Hello? Who's there?

22:44.596 --> 22:46.288
Who is it?

22:56.975 --> 22:58.303
Get down. Get down.

22:59.478 --> 23:00.636
Okay.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.607
What are you, on crack?

23:08.920 --> 23:11.215
- He's heading downtown.
- <i>I'm right behind you.</i>

23:26.304 --> 23:27.666
Who is this fucking guy?

23:30.175 --> 23:32.869
You'll get us killed, motherfucker.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.140
Pop this fucker.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.515
This is my car. Hell, no!

23:45.490 --> 23:46.750
Shoot him! Shoot him!

23:50.562 --> 23:53.563
- <i>Headed south on Waterman.</i>
- Cut him off at the tunnel.

23:53.665 --> 23:55.164
<i>I'm three blocks away.</i>

23:55.267 --> 23:56.391
Get your ass there now!

24:00.705 --> 24:02.238
Stop the fucking car!

24:08.313 --> 24:10.881
This fucker's out of his mind.
He went in the tunnel.

24:10.982 --> 24:13.516
Take the Thompson Street
over-ramp and block the exit.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.747
We'll get him from behind.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.187
You need to go to a hospital.

24:26.565 --> 24:27.757
Hold on.

24:36.274 --> 24:37.898
Seal the exit! Seal the exit!

24:40.912 --> 24:44.209
- Get there, now!
- <i>I'm right on top of you.</i>

24:52.891 --> 24:54.652
Motherfucker!

25:00.565 --> 25:03.225
You need to go to a hospital.

25:03.802 --> 25:08.305
No hospitals. No hospitals.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.630
Bring me a towel with
some hot water on it.

25:42.974 --> 25:45.508
And don't forget the soap.
Bring the soap.

25:58.857 --> 26:02.188
Look, you want me to help you,
you gotta put that thing away.

26:03.862 --> 26:08.956
- Okay. Take your clothes off.
- Are you fucking nuts?

26:09.067 --> 26:12.330
It ain't like I ain't already seen
you naked. Take your shit off.

26:13.672 --> 26:16.673
Look, this way I know you're
less likely to bounce.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.406
Take your shit off.

26:23.181 --> 26:25.146
What, what, do you need a beat?

27:05.824 --> 27:07.448
Happy?

27:08.259 --> 27:09.724
Carmen.

27:10.228 --> 27:13.627
That's your dance name, right?
What's your real name?

27:14.265 --> 27:16.925
- Angela.
- Okay.

27:17.035 --> 27:21.697
Angela, who's probably
not from Cuba, listen.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.635
I have no intentions
of hurting you.

27:23.742 --> 27:27.039
Just don't make me get stupid,
all right? Just be cool...

27:27.145 --> 27:31.978
do what I say, everything will
be all right. You feel me?

27:32.884 --> 27:34.747
Yeah, I feel you.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.414
Here. Help me get this off.

27:51.469 --> 27:52.797
It's showtime.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.854
You should be a nurse, girl.

28:15.960 --> 28:20.087
What? And leave my good-paying
job as a stripper?

28:21.800 --> 28:25.893
My mother was a nurse in
Puerto Rico. Minimum wage.

28:26.004 --> 28:31.633
- Do I believe this story?
- Why not? It's free.

28:36.514 --> 28:38.707
Translation?

28:38.817 --> 28:40.475
Heal, heal, by the butt of a frog.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.778
If it doesn't heal today,
it'll heal tomorrow.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.319
Try it. It's good luck.

28:48.259 --> 28:52.318
Okay, well, now that
you're all bandaged up...

28:52.430 --> 28:54.259
I should let you rest.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.564
Yeah, we both should.
It's a good idea.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.666
Come lay down next to me.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.644
Look. As much shit as
I've done in my life...

29:06.745 --> 29:08.779
I've never housed a
woman for some pussy.

29:08.880 --> 29:11.312
And I don't plan on starting now.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.082
Just lay down.

29:19.924 --> 29:23.152
Other side. Away from the door.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.296
Just humor me.

31:43.368 --> 31:47.131
- What you doing?
- You want some?

31:48.539 --> 31:53.406
- You got a lot of game, huh?
- I was referring to the lip-gloss.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.810
So how long are you
gonna hold me hostage?

32:02.954 --> 32:05.215
Good question.

32:26.577 --> 32:28.008
Why are you doing this?

32:28.112 --> 32:30.680
<i>Mama.</i>

32:30.782 --> 32:33.874
Stop tape.

32:34.385 --> 32:35.884
<i>Mama.</i>

32:35.987 --> 32:38.248
- It's your turn.
- I did it the last fucking time.

32:38.356 --> 32:40.788
It's your kid, babe.
I'll handle it from here.

33:01.512 --> 33:04.206
- Mama.
- I'm coming, baby.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.747
Mama!

33:13.858 --> 33:18.952
Oh, honey. Here.
Let's take the mask off.

33:19.063 --> 33:21.859
That's okay, baby.
We'll put it right back on.

33:21.966 --> 33:26.264
Here. Okay. Come on.
All right. Come on.

33:27.805 --> 33:31.705
That's a good boy.
Come on, sweetie.

33:37.215 --> 33:41.046
Here. You sit down, right here.

33:41.152 --> 33:44.847
Oh, yeah. It's okay.
We'll take this off just for a minute.

33:44.956 --> 33:48.355
- I wanna be Spiderman.
- Oh, we'll see. We'll see.

33:48.459 --> 33:51.722
I wanna go trick-or-treating.
I want candy, Mama.

33:51.829 --> 33:54.830
Baby, you can't go out there.
Here are your meds.

33:54.932 --> 33:58.297
Here are your meds.
Take that now. Good boy.

34:01.672 --> 34:06.266
- Okay, that's good.
- I wanna go trick-or-treating, Mama.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.444
I know, baby. I'm...
Mommy's gonna sing to you.

34:08.545 --> 34:12.013
Mommy's gonna sing
to you now. Okay?

34:26.630 --> 34:32.931
<i>I finally get my hands on a half a
million dollars and it's wired.</i>

34:34.839 --> 34:38.272
<i>Gotta be bank money or cop money.</i>

34:38.376 --> 34:41.103
<i>No one else would rig
it up like that.</i>

34:42.346 --> 34:47.212
<i>If I try to keep it,
we're both in danger.</i>

34:53.157 --> 34:55.418
<i>She doesn't even know.</i>

34:57.361 --> 34:59.452
<i>It doesn't seem fair.</i>

35:08.039 --> 35:13.805
<i>Only one way out. That
money was our lifeline.</i>

35:19.684 --> 35:21.775
- What?
- Gino.

35:22.820 --> 35:24.911
It's for you.

35:30.995 --> 35:33.188
- Yeah.
- Hey, look.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.762
No problems, no questions.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.594
Return all the money and then
everything is cool, right?

35:44.408 --> 35:46.533
- Where are you?
- I'll call you back. No!

35:48.212 --> 35:49.540
No.

35:56.287 --> 36:00.790
- Are we dead?
- Yes.

36:14.739 --> 36:17.467
Okay. So we have the most
wonderful thing for you tonight.

36:19.477 --> 36:21.204
Yes.

36:21.312 --> 36:26.076
The most beautiful little rat.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.975
I had a pet rat when I
was in junior high.

36:29.887 --> 36:32.649
But sometimes rats get hungry.

36:38.429 --> 36:41.362
- <i>What the fuck?</i>
- Stop the tape.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.437
- I think she's dead, Walter.
- You're shitting me.

36:50.541 --> 36:55.169
- I can't find a pulse.
- Fucking Jesus-fucking-Christ.

36:58.749 --> 37:01.113
Okay, get away from... Get a...

37:01.419 --> 37:04.010
Gee, she's probably got
that bird-flu thing.

37:04.121 --> 37:06.018
Yeah, sure.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.025
- Check that out.
- What is it?

37:14.131 --> 37:16.665
Bitch had a fucking heart
condition, is what it is.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.831
I suppose that's my fault.

37:21.939 --> 37:23.870
None of my picks ever
dropped dead on us.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.510
So all of a sudden you're
the health expert.

37:28.045 --> 37:31.603
You can tell if someone walking down
the street has a heart condition.

37:31.716 --> 37:33.340
Look, you gonna help me with this?

37:44.762 --> 37:46.489
You were sleeping.
What are you doing?

37:46.597 --> 37:50.394
- What the fuck is all this purple shit?
- The security dye in with the money.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.502
- How would I know that was in there?
- Why are you rummaging...

37:53.604 --> 37:56.502
- ...through people's shit?
- People? Nigga, what people?

37:56.607 --> 37:59.574
I don't see people. You held
me hostage at gunpoint...

37:59.677 --> 38:03.042
- ...and nearly tried to rape me.
- Rape you? I don't even want you.

38:03.414 --> 38:07.917
Okay. What about, "Oh, take off all
your clothes and lie down with me"?

38:08.219 --> 38:11.584
Would you... Look at this shit,
would you? Look at this shit. Look.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.347
You need to buy me a new fur.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.390
If you don't get that fake
shit out of my face...

38:21.799 --> 38:26.802
Man. That money was
our bargaining chip.

38:26.904 --> 38:31.464
Bargaining chip? Look, whatever.
All I know, there's another briefcase.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.810
If that briefcase is full of money,
just break me off my share...

38:34.912 --> 38:38.448
for of all of my troubles, and
I'll be on my merry freaking way.

38:38.549 --> 38:40.674
What is wrong with you?
It's an identical case.

38:40.785 --> 38:42.716
There's a security
device in that one too.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.912
You need a special
tool to de-rig it.

38:47.191 --> 38:48.918
Fuck.

38:55.466 --> 39:01.061
You know what? That's a good idea.
You wanna bounce, just leave. Take...

39:01.172 --> 39:03.263
So wait. You get to keep
it all for yourself.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.908
What story am I
supposed to believe?

39:11.082 --> 39:13.150
I'm sorry.

39:34.305 --> 39:37.704
Mommy, he's purple
like Lord Krishna.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.078
The old-man mask is $7.99.

39:49.186 --> 39:52.483
And I'm gonna need
to price-check that.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.715
- Can't I just wear it?
- Sure.

39:54.825 --> 39:57.052
After you take it
off and pay for it.

40:06.804 --> 40:10.863
Matt? I'm gonna need a price
check on the old-lady mask.

40:10.975 --> 40:13.100
Price check on three.

40:19.316 --> 40:23.045
Still waiting on a price check
on three on an old-lady mask.

40:24.622 --> 40:28.681
It's a dye. It's not gonna come
off the money. That's the point.

40:28.793 --> 40:33.023
Oh, hell no. I'm gonna clean this
bitch off and I'm gonna spend it.

40:33.130 --> 40:38.827
Shit. Why does this shit
always happen to me?

40:38.936 --> 40:41.231
And I just got my hair done.

40:41.338 --> 40:43.804
- Turn around.
- Why?

40:43.908 --> 40:46.670
So I can do your back, okay?

40:52.416 --> 40:54.711
Be gentle, please.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.915
Here, <i>café con leche.</i>

41:03.761 --> 41:04.953
Prick.

41:20.344 --> 41:25.347
- Who's gonna pay for all this?
- Money was rigged.

41:25.783 --> 41:30.980
Come over here. Look at this tub.
Who's gonna clean that?

41:34.625 --> 41:38.252
Yeah. For what?

41:39.663 --> 41:41.788
Yeah, tell him I'm on my way.

41:43.033 --> 41:47.570
- Captain wants to see me.
- I'm talking to you. Come over here.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.261
Look at the tub.

41:51.976 --> 41:55.876
These little Mad Cow
burgers are the bomb.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.310
Excuse me.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.582
Did you blow one? Oh, shit.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.853
You're the one who paid $60
to stick your face in my ass.

42:12.963 --> 42:15.793
I should have gave you incense
and stuck that up your ass.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.230
- Protected the crime scene.
- Like you never fart.

42:18.335 --> 42:19.959
Shit, I don't fart like that.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.365
These are good, but Mickey
D's fries are better...

42:22.473 --> 42:25.770
because they fry them in some crazy
beef or silicone or something.

42:26.277 --> 42:29.312
For real. Did you see
that flick on it?

42:29.413 --> 42:31.674
Yeah, <i>Super Size Me.</i>

42:37.354 --> 42:39.979
Listen to that harmony. Listen.

42:46.530 --> 42:51.363
Excuse me. This is my car.
That's my demo. This is my world.

42:51.468 --> 42:54.537
Look, if I'm delaying you from
your pursuit of happiness...

42:54.638 --> 42:57.036
fame, fortune and your
meeting with Puffy, fine.

42:57.141 --> 42:59.835
You and your demo can
bounce, all right?

42:59.944 --> 43:02.740
I mean, I'll de-rig the money
and I'll send you some of it.

43:02.846 --> 43:05.437
Oh, you'll send me some of it.
Please, you're cheap.

43:05.549 --> 43:07.810
- I saw you tip the waitress.
- I'm ch...? I'm broke.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.782
Yes. No, you're cheap. I wouldn't
trust you to send me shit.

43:10.888 --> 43:14.981
So you wanna go solo? All right,
cool. Then option A...

43:15.092 --> 43:17.854
de-rig the other briefcase and
break me off some hush money.

43:17.962 --> 43:21.691
Or option B, I don't
know, maybe I could...

43:21.799 --> 43:24.163
run to the nearest
police station and say:

43:26.904 --> 43:29.871
"I just saw this black man and he
was running with a briefcase...

43:29.974 --> 43:32.034
because he robbed a bank
and he went that way."

43:35.913 --> 43:38.311
We've got to find a closer place.

43:38.415 --> 43:41.848
Sure. Why don't we just stick them
under the floorboards like Gacy?

43:41.952 --> 43:45.180
Like if they ever came to the house
there wouldn't be enough evidence.

43:45.289 --> 43:48.187
A tape doesn't prove anything.
How does anyone know what's real?

43:48.292 --> 43:49.450
Have you heard of DNA?

43:49.560 --> 43:52.254
You don't think they'd find
a spot of blood somewhere?

43:55.132 --> 43:57.530
We're bonded for life, pretty boy.

44:07.711 --> 44:11.247
- You hungry?
- The diner?

44:11.682 --> 44:14.649
- Oh, let's go get cleaned up.
- Yeah.

44:20.157 --> 44:23.715
- Franklin's here, sir. He's clean.
- Cool.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.191
You finish up with our friends
at Homeland Security.

44:26.296 --> 44:27.658
Okay.

44:35.773 --> 44:37.738
Hey, Frankie!

44:41.979 --> 44:43.910
What's up, player?

44:46.984 --> 44:50.485
- Did you read the paper today?
- No.

44:50.587 --> 44:52.951
Some crazy shit, man.

44:53.057 --> 44:54.522
They got an article...

44:54.625 --> 44:58.092
about high school kids having
oral sex like it ain't nothing.

44:58.195 --> 45:01.287
Like kissing used to be.
You got a daughter, right?

45:01.398 --> 45:03.363
- Yeah.
- How old's your baby?

45:03.467 --> 45:06.798
- She's 14.
- Mine's 13.

45:07.404 --> 45:12.567
Statistically, what the trip is,
it's the white kids from suburbia.

45:12.676 --> 45:16.143
They're more into the oral sex.
Blacks, Latinos, Asians are all fucking.

45:16.246 --> 45:20.874
But the white kids got them
beat, per capita, on blowjobs.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.250
You think I'm fucking
with you, huh?

45:25.622 --> 45:29.089
Check it out. Right
there for yourself.

45:30.527 --> 45:35.621
Right under the article
on the dirty cops.

45:35.833 --> 45:38.299
Yeah, another Rodney
King-type shit.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.629
They got some knucklehead cops...

45:40.738 --> 45:44.274
beating up inmates and
taking their jewelry, man.

45:44.908 --> 45:48.466
Now, who wants some pimpy shit
like that anyway? Am I right?

45:50.180 --> 45:52.407
But you know how it is, man.

45:53.984 --> 45:56.644
Dirty cops anywhere kind of...

45:57.755 --> 46:00.551
Kind of makes us all
look bad, don't it?

46:00.657 --> 46:02.725
Captain, I can explain.

46:07.631 --> 46:09.858
I'm not an idealist.

46:10.267 --> 46:14.531
I know we put our lives on the
line daily for inadequate pay.

46:14.638 --> 46:19.107
Criminals make more in a month
than we will in a whole damn year.

46:19.676 --> 46:22.506
So the temptation's always
gonna be there to say:

46:22.613 --> 46:28.618
"Fuck it. Let me augment my
retirement fund a little bit."

46:29.453 --> 46:32.317
- But you took it to a new level.
- There's a miscommunication.

46:32.422 --> 46:35.548
- That money was used strictly for...
- Motherfucker, please.

46:35.659 --> 46:37.590
You took the money from
the evidence room.

46:37.694 --> 46:39.955
You set up a deal to
buy some contraband.

46:40.063 --> 46:42.028
When the deal goes
down, you bust them.

46:42.132 --> 46:44.962
And you put the money back before
anyone knows the difference.

46:45.068 --> 46:47.693
You sell the contraband
or you keep it.

46:47.805 --> 46:50.066
That shit ain't original.

46:50.174 --> 46:52.435
Only difference was, this
time I rigged the money.

46:52.543 --> 46:55.612
And apparently,
this time, you lost it.

47:01.118 --> 47:04.210
So why am I out here instead
of an IAD review board?

47:07.157 --> 47:09.054
Like I said...

47:09.259 --> 47:13.125
dirty cops anywhere make
it hard for all of us.

47:13.530 --> 47:15.621
I'm prepared to offer you an out.

47:16.366 --> 47:19.594
- I'm listening.
- Good. One...

47:20.737 --> 47:23.829
you write up a report
on the busted sting.

47:23.941 --> 47:27.272
You take the hit on the lost
money, I sign off on it.

47:27.377 --> 47:30.446
Two, I want all those Berettas
put in the evidence room.

47:30.547 --> 47:32.740
I don't want that shit on
the street. Three...

47:32.850 --> 47:35.544
you and your cockroach friends
submit your resignations...

47:35.652 --> 47:38.312
which I will accept,
effective immediately.

47:38.422 --> 47:41.491
And you will retire with
your pensions intact.

47:41.592 --> 47:43.387
Lastly, Lee.

47:48.565 --> 47:50.599
Detective Lee goes
with you right now.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.530
You hand over any
surveillance tapes...

47:52.636 --> 47:55.170
audio or visual, that
have Lucky on them.

47:55.272 --> 47:57.863
- Lucky?
- Lucky.

47:57.975 --> 48:00.566
You forget you ever saw his ass.

48:00.944 --> 48:03.604
Lucky's my problem now.

48:06.283 --> 48:08.283
All the tsunamis,
earthquakes, floods.

48:08.385 --> 48:10.316
Man is a virus and God
is finished with us.

48:10.420 --> 48:11.748
Bullshit.

48:11.855 --> 48:15.152
We're the ones raising temperatures
with greenhouse gases, not God.

48:15.259 --> 48:17.520
That's why we got more
category-five hurricanes now.

48:17.628 --> 48:19.787
It's so much bigger
than that, babe.

48:20.464 --> 48:24.466
- I'm a serial killer!
- So are we.

48:24.568 --> 48:26.761
- You go trick-or-treating, now.
- Bye.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.237
All right.

48:30.507 --> 48:33.337
If I could get you
the New York fight back...

48:34.144 --> 48:38.340
- ...would you make a deal with me?
- What's the deal?

48:38.849 --> 48:44.012
If you win, you win. And
if you lose, you quit.

48:48.058 --> 48:49.591
Go sit down, honey.

48:49.693 --> 48:52.660
Order some vegetarian to go for
Eugene. I'm gonna wash up.

48:55.799 --> 48:58.561
In this world of plagues
and killer bird flus...

48:58.669 --> 49:01.363
you find being hygienically
conscious amusing?

49:01.471 --> 49:03.698
- Hey, you go when you go.
- Look at you.

49:03.807 --> 49:08.310
Always with the fingers in the face.
Spreading germs. It's disgusting.

49:09.446 --> 49:12.811
<i>Eugene was always special.
His father couldn't handle it.</i>

49:12.916 --> 49:16.213
<i>Left before his fifth birthday.
What was I supposed to do?</i>

49:16.320 --> 49:18.581
<i>Wait for Mr. Perfect?</i>

49:18.822 --> 49:23.325
<i>Wait for someone to rescue me and
my son? Life didn't give rebates.</i>

49:23.427 --> 49:28.191
I gotta get some food in me.
I got this low-blood-sugar thing.

49:28.665 --> 49:31.563
All that psychosomatic shit.
I don't believe in all of that.

49:31.768 --> 49:33.699
Like Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome and all that.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.771
- Hey. I know a guy who died of that.
- Yeah, right.

49:36.873 --> 49:39.840
Nobody's ever died of
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

49:39.943 --> 49:43.535
He couldn't even get out of
bed to eat. It was really sad.

49:44.414 --> 49:47.449
- Must have been a white guy.
- Yeah, so what?

49:47.551 --> 49:49.949
White people got a lot of
free time on their hands.

49:50.053 --> 49:52.917
Black people, we ain't got
time for all that shit.

49:53.023 --> 49:54.988
Okay, Dr. Phil, so,
what about Latinos?

49:55.525 --> 49:59.061
Mi madre <i>always said there are three
kinds of people in this world:</i>

49:59.162 --> 50:01.230
<i>People who watch things happen...</i>

50:01.331 --> 50:03.763
<i>people who complain about
things that happen...</i>

50:03.867 --> 50:06.595
<i>and people who make things happen.</i>

50:06.703 --> 50:09.328
<i>I got a lot I wanna do in my life.</i>

50:09.439 --> 50:11.803
<i>I think men just slow you down.</i>

50:11.908 --> 50:14.272
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through there, to the right.

50:14.378 --> 50:16.139
Great. Catch up.

50:17.979 --> 50:20.309
You got the salt and pepper?
Ketchup?

50:22.283 --> 50:24.510
Look at this guy. Look at this guy.

50:29.457 --> 50:31.081
Hey, hey!

50:31.492 --> 50:33.492
Stay right there.

50:34.061 --> 50:35.890
Good afternoon.

50:37.231 --> 50:40.164
- You trying to run out on the check?
- No, no, no.

50:40.268 --> 50:42.859
Waitressing is tough enough
without having to pick up...

50:42.970 --> 50:45.334
- Hold him right there, officer.
- What are you doing?

50:45.439 --> 50:48.030
This man has been trying to
run out since I got pregnant.

50:48.142 --> 50:50.403
And I know it's his, no
matter what he says.

50:50.511 --> 50:54.047
I haven't even been with another man
since last my period. Not even one.

50:54.148 --> 50:56.682
I saw him exiting the back door
of the restaurant, okay?

50:56.784 --> 50:58.647
I thought he was running
out on his bill.

50:58.753 --> 51:00.286
- Me?
- We haven't even ordered yet.

51:00.388 --> 51:02.649
And you know I'm starving.
I'm eating for two.

51:02.757 --> 51:06.293
- You enjoy your lunch.
- Hey, thanks a lot.

51:07.295 --> 51:09.192
Hey, we gotta roll.

51:10.031 --> 51:11.758
You want me to quit
fighting for good.

51:17.238 --> 51:21.536
- For us.
- No, I can't promise that.

51:25.346 --> 51:28.040
- Where you going?
- Why don't you just pay up?

51:28.216 --> 51:30.443
I'm gonna go outside...

51:30.551 --> 51:33.552
and I'm gonna make a
couple phone calls...

51:33.654 --> 51:36.484
and I'm gonna see
what I can scam up.

51:41.195 --> 51:43.923
That was truly fucked up. You
were just gonna leave me here?

51:44.031 --> 51:47.794
- Look, you were better off without me.
- I just saved your ass.

51:48.135 --> 51:51.170
Look, from now on... From now on...

51:51.272 --> 51:54.830
you gotta do exactly what
I tell you to do. Okay?

51:54.942 --> 51:58.102
No more clowning around.

51:58.813 --> 52:00.471
Feel me?

52:04.318 --> 52:07.182
I'm gonna call a friend
of mine. He owes me.

52:07.288 --> 52:09.515
See if he'll let us stay
at one of his cribs...

52:09.624 --> 52:11.919
lay low for a little while.

52:12.226 --> 52:14.157
Damn. We gotta get
rid of this car too.

52:14.262 --> 52:16.592
- <i>capture of the so-called
Sawtooth Killers.</i>

52:16.697 --> 52:18.230
<i>Captain Davis had this to say.</i>

52:18.332 --> 52:20.593
<i>There have been some new
developments in the case.</i>

52:20.701 --> 52:22.564
<i>We're following numerous leads.</i>

52:22.670 --> 52:25.705
<i>We're asking any citizens in the
area to please call our help line.</i>

52:26.007 --> 52:29.474
<i>1-800-COP-TIPS. Thank you.</i>

52:34.649 --> 52:37.411
You look like you just saw a ghost.

52:40.254 --> 52:43.346
I'm... I'm so sorry. Can
you repeat that, please?

52:45.393 --> 52:46.926
Yep.

52:51.299 --> 52:55.267
- Move. Move!
- Have a little respect, please!

52:55.369 --> 52:57.494
Stop the van! Stop
the van right now!

52:57.605 --> 53:00.503
Stop the van! Stop the
fucking van right now!

53:00.608 --> 53:03.643
What the fuck?
What kind of fucking shit...?

53:04.045 --> 53:06.807
- I'm gonna fucking kill you! Rainn!
- What kind of fucking...?

53:06.914 --> 53:08.914
I'm gonna kill you!

53:09.183 --> 53:11.410
What is this, National
Impulse Day or something?

53:11.519 --> 53:14.144
- Remember the time we did a couple?
- That's not the point.

53:14.255 --> 53:15.982
We eat at that diner,
for chrissakes.

53:16.090 --> 53:17.987
Sometimes you just have
to be spontaneous.

53:18.092 --> 53:20.820
I'd appreciate next time if
you'd give me a little warning.

53:20.928 --> 53:22.757
I didn't even have
time for the camera.

53:23.197 --> 53:25.788
I feel so fucking alive right now.

53:25.900 --> 53:27.524
Oh, jeez.

53:37.044 --> 53:38.441
What are you gonna do to us?

53:40.948 --> 53:42.447
Blue. Blue.

53:42.550 --> 53:47.212
Blue, blue, blue is for you, miss.
True blue. Thank you very much.

53:47.321 --> 53:49.946
- Blue.
- What are you gonna do to us?

53:51.592 --> 53:55.184
Roland? Roland?

54:09.043 --> 54:12.670
- So it worked out.
- Babe, when you're right, you're right.

54:19.887 --> 54:22.854
I knew you'd like that
little punky girl.

54:27.461 --> 54:31.156
- Would you wait a minute? Shit.
- You don't even know the guy.

54:31.265 --> 54:35.529
Which is why it's fucking important
to make a good first impression.

54:37.171 --> 54:39.705
- First impression, huh?
- Yes.

54:40.841 --> 54:43.307
- I'm impressed.
- Whatever.

54:47.281 --> 54:49.645
Who is it? Who is it?

54:51.485 --> 54:53.780
Lucky's here with a guest.

55:03.164 --> 55:04.959
Let me see your bag, miss.

55:06.667 --> 55:08.428
Quiet.

55:09.870 --> 55:12.564
And cut! Cut!

55:12.673 --> 55:14.832
Oh, yes.

55:14.942 --> 55:17.135
Hot set!

55:19.947 --> 55:22.481
Oh, my God.

55:22.583 --> 55:24.947
Heaven has sent me an angel.

55:25.486 --> 55:29.420
Since when you walking around
with a freaking Venus, Lucky?

55:29.523 --> 55:31.215
- Well...
- Oh, look, she's blushing.

55:31.625 --> 55:35.786
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Angela Maria Guzmano del Lopez.

55:35.896 --> 55:37.930
Angie for short.

55:43.070 --> 55:44.797
That means singer.

55:46.073 --> 55:48.073
- Look, Mendez...
- You have something for me?

55:48.909 --> 55:50.499
That's my demo.

55:50.611 --> 55:52.906
Don't touch that!

55:54.415 --> 55:56.983
- This is you, honey?
- Yeah.

55:57.084 --> 56:01.177
Sherman! Move Breakman to 4.

56:01.589 --> 56:03.816
Lucky, Angie.

56:04.492 --> 56:06.685
- Look, Mendez, so...
- Angie, come. Angie, come.

56:06.794 --> 56:08.623
You too, Lucky, come on.
Come, come.

56:08.729 --> 56:13.198
Lucky, sit. Angie, sit right here.
Sit, sit. Lucky, sit, sit, sit.

56:13.801 --> 56:15.835
Don't touch that!

56:16.270 --> 56:19.669
Picture, picture, picture.
Lucky, please.

56:19.773 --> 56:22.000
Lucky, come on, come on, come on.

56:22.109 --> 56:24.803
Okay. Lucky, don't smile.

56:25.646 --> 56:27.441
Yeah! Okay, okay.

56:27.548 --> 56:29.548
I'm gonna put you both
in a movie right now.

56:29.650 --> 56:32.810
- I'll pay you $1000 each, cash.
- Mendez, you ain't gotta do that.

56:32.920 --> 56:35.682
What, what, what? Come on, man.
Just do a scene with her.

56:35.789 --> 56:38.915
You do it for free anyway, might
as well get paid, right, honey?

56:39.026 --> 56:41.788
- Head back.
- Is that better?

56:41.896 --> 56:45.124
Shake your head a little.
That's it, shake your head!

56:45.232 --> 56:48.460
America's so fucked
up racially, right?

56:48.569 --> 56:52.605
Latinos are the new exotic.

56:52.873 --> 56:55.134
I mean, look at some of
the Hollywood pictures.

56:55.242 --> 56:58.072
The dirty cop one, <i>Training Day.</i>
They put Denzel with...

56:58.179 --> 57:01.214
- Eva Mendes.
- Oh, my God. Gorgeous Latina.

57:01.315 --> 57:04.907
And then the one with the
<i>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i> kid.

57:05.019 --> 57:06.381
- What's his name?
- Will Smith.

57:06.487 --> 57:09.055
Yes, yes, yes. They put in
the same Latina with him.

57:09.156 --> 57:13.192
And then the <i>Catwoman</i> with...
I know this one. I know this one.

57:15.462 --> 57:17.962
Benjamin Bratt.

57:18.866 --> 57:21.025
He put fine in fine.

57:21.135 --> 57:24.295
You put a black guy with a black
girl, what you got? Black movie.

57:24.405 --> 57:26.598
White with white?
Been there, done that.

57:26.707 --> 57:29.901
You gotta mix it up. Make it sexy.

57:30.010 --> 57:33.136
You know, we all fantasize
about the other, right?

57:33.247 --> 57:36.043
- All right, cut.
- Antonio. Antonio, come here, quick!

57:36.150 --> 57:38.548
Quick, quick. Antonio,
picture, picture, picture.

57:38.652 --> 57:40.652
Picture. Look in the camera.

57:40.754 --> 57:44.688
Okay? You got it?
Okay, get the fuck out.

57:45.359 --> 57:47.757
Latinos are safe, you see.

57:47.861 --> 57:53.228
White folks love us, black
folks live next door to us.

57:53.667 --> 57:55.860
Who wouldn't wanna
bang a hot Latina?

57:55.970 --> 57:57.901
Unless, of course, you
was a fag like me.

57:58.005 --> 58:00.073
Hey, hey, hey, look.
Mendez, Mendez. Hey.

58:00.174 --> 58:01.571
I need a car, man.

58:01.675 --> 58:04.209
I need a car and I need a
place where we can hole up.

58:04.311 --> 58:06.777
Do I owe you or do you owe me?

58:07.781 --> 58:10.213
I'm... I'm just fucking
with you, okay?

58:10.317 --> 58:13.875
Look, what are you, her protector now?
She can't speak?

58:14.555 --> 58:15.849
- Come here, come here.
- Hey.

58:15.956 --> 58:18.149
Come here. Please!

58:18.926 --> 58:20.721
I got a guy in there, <i>mamita.</i>

58:25.165 --> 58:28.359
An actor's an actor. Come on,
act like you're enjoying yourselves.

58:31.972 --> 58:33.972
Look, honestly...

58:34.208 --> 58:37.835
I can't do anything today that
I won't be proud of tomorrow.

58:38.178 --> 58:40.473
- Did you hear that shit?
- Yes, girl.

58:40.581 --> 58:41.943
Do you believe that shit?

58:42.049 --> 58:44.117
I didn't know they still
make girls like this!

58:44.218 --> 58:47.219
You gotta keep her here,
Lucky. Keep her, okay?

58:47.321 --> 58:50.618
Sherman, how's the transmission
on the old Eldorado?

58:50.724 --> 58:54.191
It's fine. You deaf prick, go
get the keys to the Eldo... Go!

58:54.295 --> 58:57.330
Go get the keys. And to
the country place too.

58:57.431 --> 58:59.692
I got just the spot for you, okay?

58:59.800 --> 59:01.595
It used to belong to
my wife's mother...

59:01.702 --> 59:03.963
back then when I
still needed a wife.

59:04.071 --> 59:07.004
Look, when you get back,
do me a favor, okay?

59:07.107 --> 59:10.335
I want you to consider
letting me be her manager.

59:10.444 --> 59:12.034
I'll take 10 percent. Legit.

59:12.146 --> 59:15.579
And you're never gonna have to worry
about me trying to get into your pants.

59:15.683 --> 59:17.011
Keys!

59:18.052 --> 59:20.450
- Ain't that the truth, Lucky?
- That's the truth.

59:24.358 --> 59:26.323
Antonio?

59:39.506 --> 59:42.871
Roland? You okay?

59:46.080 --> 59:48.410
Baby, you're not even...
You're not even tied up.

59:48.515 --> 59:52.244
Come on. Hey, untie me, okay?

59:52.686 --> 59:54.981
Listen to me. They tossed
my handbag in here...

59:55.089 --> 59:56.451
when they brought us in.

59:56.557 --> 59:59.023
You remember the pepper
spray that you gave me?

59:59.126 --> 01:00:01.285
Remember the pepper spray?
I still have it.

01:00:01.929 --> 01:00:04.691
- That's my superhero.
- If we're gonna fucking die...

01:00:04.798 --> 01:00:07.492
let's just let it be on
our own terms, okay?

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:18.838
- Hey, hey. Who you calling?
- What, are you my man now?

01:00:18.946 --> 01:00:20.707
I gotta pee.

01:00:20.814 --> 01:00:23.041
Well, I guess you better
roll the window down...

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:26.014
and back your ass up to the
crack and piss out the window.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.815
I don't see any toilets,
and I ain't stopping.

01:00:33.861 --> 01:00:37.055
<i>Roland, you just gotta untie me.</i>

01:00:37.164 --> 01:00:41.360
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry. I've never
been strong enough for you.</i>

01:00:41.468 --> 01:00:44.093
<i>No, you are strong enough.</i>

01:00:44.471 --> 01:00:46.163
<i>Please, just untie me.</i>

01:00:46.273 --> 01:00:48.773
<i>Okay? You remember the pepper
spray that you gave me?</i>

01:00:48.876 --> 01:00:51.604
<i>Remember the pepper spray?
I still have it.</i>

01:00:52.546 --> 01:00:55.740
Pepper spray. That's original.

01:00:58.252 --> 01:01:01.515
Still, you have to give
her points for spunk.

01:01:10.764 --> 01:01:12.695
Crazy motherfuckers.

01:01:23.744 --> 01:01:26.074
Stop! No!

01:01:29.883 --> 01:01:31.507
Stop.

01:01:34.655 --> 01:01:38.486
I gotta pee. You've gotta stop
the car. I gotta pee really bad.

01:01:38.592 --> 01:01:42.321
I gotta pee, I'm serious. Please,
stop the car. I gotta pee.

01:01:42.563 --> 01:01:44.062
All right.

01:01:45.232 --> 01:01:47.391
I'm gonna pee all over
the car in a second.

01:01:47.501 --> 01:01:49.296
Please, stop the car.
Just stop the car.

01:01:49.403 --> 01:01:52.438
- You gonna be real chilly if...
- Stop the car. Stop the car, please.

01:01:52.539 --> 01:01:54.129
I gotta pee.

01:01:57.544 --> 01:01:59.874
Oh, God.

01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:11.519
Don't look.

01:02:23.437 --> 01:02:25.767
<i>You've reached Solly Sol, the man.</i>

01:02:25.873 --> 01:02:29.602
<i>Time is money, so
make it quick, money.</i>

01:02:44.091 --> 01:02:45.385
Yeah.

01:02:45.492 --> 01:02:47.287
A friend of yours just
came by to visit.

01:02:47.394 --> 01:02:51.931
- Who might that be?
- Lucky and his new girlfriend.

01:02:52.032 --> 01:02:54.191
What a doll.

01:02:59.206 --> 01:03:01.433
- No more cellphone.
- What the fuck?

01:03:01.542 --> 01:03:03.906
GPS. Could be tracking us.

01:03:04.278 --> 01:03:06.744
From now on, we going off grid.
They wanna track us...

01:03:06.847 --> 01:03:08.710
they can track that
shit up to Canada.

01:03:08.815 --> 01:03:10.815
Thank you, folks, for coming.

01:03:10.918 --> 01:03:13.680
All the ballistics at the strip
club have been accounted for.

01:03:13.787 --> 01:03:17.152
- Meaning what?
- It seems Lucky didn't shoot anybody.

01:03:17.257 --> 01:03:19.848
Not yet anyway. What about
the Canadian border?

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.756
They didn't show.
Neither did the girl.

01:03:24.164 --> 01:03:27.290
- It's got mayonnaise in it, man.
- I told those jokers you wanted soy.

01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:29.526
Well, check it out next
time, will you? Shit.

01:03:29.636 --> 01:03:32.068
- What about Franklin?
- Still tracking his every move.

01:03:32.172 --> 01:03:35.264
- Hey, can I have your sandwich?
- Yeah, yeah. Knock yourself out.

01:03:36.743 --> 01:03:39.710
I think I better change
your bandage, Kojak.

01:03:39.846 --> 01:03:41.937
Bandage is fine.

01:03:44.885 --> 01:03:46.646
You was fucking Sol, wasn't you?

01:03:46.753 --> 01:03:49.481
- Say what?
- You was boning him, right?

01:03:50.924 --> 01:03:54.050
That night, you was supposed to be
the getaway driver, wasn't you?

01:03:54.161 --> 01:03:57.162
No. We didn't need a getaway
until you fucked things up.

01:03:57.264 --> 01:04:01.266
I didn't fuck things up. The whole
scenario was a setup. Sol was a fink.

01:04:01.368 --> 01:04:04.562
Gino was in with the cops, and they
was running the shake-and-take.

01:04:05.872 --> 01:04:08.065
Don't worry about Sol
returning your phone calls.

01:04:08.175 --> 01:04:11.836
- What?
- They popped him. He's dead.

01:04:21.221 --> 01:04:24.222
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

01:04:24.992 --> 01:04:29.461
Sometimes in life, it seems like
if you don't have bad luck...

01:04:29.963 --> 01:04:34.022
- ...you don't have no luck at all.
- No.

01:04:34.134 --> 01:04:38.568
No, I did not sleep
with Sol and no.

01:04:38.672 --> 01:04:43.209
- Whatever. It don't matter.
- What? No, it matters to me.

01:04:43.443 --> 01:04:46.341
I know that you think
because I'm a stripper...

01:04:46.446 --> 01:04:49.743
that I sleep with everybody,
but that's not the case.

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:52.976
- Sol was just an acquaintance.
- Or just a friend, right?

01:04:53.086 --> 01:04:55.984
Yes. I mean, you know, he gave
me paper every now and then...

01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:58.953
but to tell the truth, he was
more intent on impressing you.

01:04:59.059 --> 01:05:02.390
He used to say that you
were a true player.

01:05:02.496 --> 01:05:05.292
You know, an original gangster.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.163
Original gangster. Player.

01:05:11.338 --> 01:05:14.839
Well, the frog's in a well,
and rat's in a cage.

01:05:15.142 --> 01:05:17.267
What does that mean?

01:05:17.878 --> 01:05:20.139
It means all of these player
gangsters out here...

01:05:20.247 --> 01:05:22.474
they get so caught up
in their own fantasy...

01:05:22.582 --> 01:05:26.209
that they can't see the real picture.
See, they think they running shit.

01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:28.944
They ain't running shit. More
likely they running in shit.

01:05:29.056 --> 01:05:31.249
They just can't smell it though.

01:05:32.359 --> 01:05:36.657
Look, I did things. I was grimy.
I hustled, I scrambled, I did all of that.

01:05:37.364 --> 01:05:39.659
At one point I thought
the world was mine.

01:05:39.766 --> 01:05:44.132
And then I realized, oh, man,
I got caught in a trick.

01:05:44.237 --> 01:05:48.296
Trick had me killing my own
people, killing myself.

01:05:49.676 --> 01:05:53.143
Probably killed more black
people than the Ku Klux Klan.

01:05:55.482 --> 01:05:58.073
So you're trying to find
your way out of hell.

01:05:58.185 --> 01:06:00.947
I can't find my way out of shit.

01:06:01.054 --> 01:06:04.749
And anybody who follows
me is foolish.

01:06:06.526 --> 01:06:08.526
Including you.

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:40.121
<i>And now authorities are offering a
$200,000 reward for the capture...</i>

01:06:40.227 --> 01:06:42.227
<i>- ...of the Sawtooth Killers.</i>
- Just pick one.

01:06:52.472 --> 01:06:54.938
Fuck you. Life's too
short to be evil.

01:07:31.044 --> 01:07:34.307
Wait up, bitch! Shit.

01:07:35.081 --> 01:07:38.014
- How much further?
- How the hell should I know?

01:07:38.118 --> 01:07:42.245
Probably could have been there if you
hadn't given the damn car a seizure.

01:07:43.256 --> 01:07:45.290
What? What?

01:07:46.193 --> 01:07:48.284
Put that shit away.

01:07:48.962 --> 01:07:50.757
My ankle.

01:07:51.665 --> 01:07:55.462
- Can you come help me, please?
- I told you about them cute-ass shoes.

01:07:58.839 --> 01:08:01.203
Just help me up, please.

01:08:02.976 --> 01:08:05.636
- You can't walk at all?
- No.

01:08:09.082 --> 01:08:12.447
Damn. Come on.

01:08:12.686 --> 01:08:14.913
- Oh, wait.
- Here.

01:08:15.021 --> 01:08:17.282
- Here, you hold this.
- Okay.

01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:19.252
I'm watching you.

01:08:19.693 --> 01:08:21.385
Damn.

01:08:24.764 --> 01:08:26.991
Jesus.

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:33.402
Keep going. Come on.

01:08:33.773 --> 01:08:36.636
- You hear something?
- Like what?

01:08:36.743 --> 01:08:38.810
I thought I heard something.

01:08:40.313 --> 01:08:42.313
Maybe it's nothing.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.612
Don't start freaking me out, Lucky.

01:08:44.716 --> 01:08:47.048
Seriously, I don't like
that <i>Blair Witch-</i> type shit.

01:08:47.153 --> 01:08:49.653
Yeah, but I bet you like biscuits.

01:09:00.166 --> 01:09:02.631
It's gotta be around
here somewhere.

01:09:06.038 --> 01:09:08.299
Here, I see something.

01:09:13.613 --> 01:09:15.874
I think...

01:09:18.184 --> 01:09:22.482
- I think this is it.
- You're kidding, right?

01:09:23.356 --> 01:09:26.720
Look, you just stay here, all right?
I'm gonna go check things out.

01:09:26.826 --> 01:09:30.725
Wait, Lucky. Seriously,
this doesn't feel right.

01:09:49.814 --> 01:09:52.510
Damn. No light.

01:09:53.386 --> 01:09:56.147
Okay. I'll see if I
can find a light.

01:09:58.325 --> 01:10:00.689
See if that telephone works.

01:10:02.162 --> 01:10:03.820
I should've left my ass in Jersey.

01:10:05.298 --> 01:10:08.856
No, there's no dial tone.
There's no dial tone.

01:10:10.036 --> 01:10:11.797
Where are you going?

01:10:12.505 --> 01:10:13.799
Lucky.

01:10:13.907 --> 01:10:16.669
I'm almost positive I've
seen it here before.

01:10:17.143 --> 01:10:19.609
A blue van.

01:10:21.548 --> 01:10:24.981
I would've called earlier, but
Fred said, "Don't get involved."

01:10:27.387 --> 01:10:31.389
He's got irritable bowels.
You know how it is.

01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:35.118
Yeah, yeah, I know how that is.
Well, Ethel, I wanna thank you.

01:10:35.228 --> 01:10:37.660
You know, you may
have saved a life.

01:10:38.298 --> 01:10:40.127
And, Fred, I wanna thank you too.

01:10:40.233 --> 01:10:44.292
Did you hear that, Fred? The young
man said I was a lifesaver.

01:10:44.604 --> 01:10:47.798
- Whose wife?
- Oh, come on.

01:10:48.942 --> 01:10:51.772
Why is it as women get older,
their hair gets shorter...

01:10:51.878 --> 01:10:54.276
and their jewelry gets bigger?

01:10:57.917 --> 01:10:59.348
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah, captain, it's Lee.</i>

01:10:59.452 --> 01:11:01.543
- <i>You in the field?</i>
- No, I'm in the office.

01:11:01.654 --> 01:11:04.723
You wanted me to notify you when
we had any movement on Franklin.

01:11:04.824 --> 01:11:07.358
- Yeah, so where is he?
- <i>North, at the old Sawtooth mill.</i>

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.428
- You're positive.
- Yeah, yeah. You want me to handle it?

01:11:11.531 --> 01:11:13.963
No, no. I'll do this myself.

01:11:14.067 --> 01:11:15.930
Fellas, you call me
if anything comes up.

01:11:16.036 --> 01:11:17.865
- Anything, all right?
- You got it.

01:11:22.776 --> 01:11:25.367
All right, tough guy.

01:11:26.079 --> 01:11:29.979
Pull up some paper there.
I'll go out and get the firewood.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.354
Leave the lamp.

01:11:47.534 --> 01:11:49.727
Oh, and the briefcase too.

01:11:55.341 --> 01:11:57.272
Humor me?

01:12:42.722 --> 01:12:45.848
I always wanted to go
sledding as a kid.

01:12:47.594 --> 01:12:49.525
Rosebud.

01:12:52.732 --> 01:12:56.165
- Like in <i>Citizen Kane?</i>
- Who?

01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:58.835
Forget it.

01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:03.465
Okay.

01:13:04.978 --> 01:13:08.206
- Put the paper in first.
- No, you put the wood in first.

01:13:08.314 --> 01:13:12.475
- No, no. You put the paper in first.
- No, the wood.

01:13:15.155 --> 01:13:17.485
Dumb black guy don't know shit.

01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:19.521
- What?
- Exactly.

01:13:19.626 --> 01:13:23.287
So don't go acting all high and mighty
just because you saw a couple of films.

01:13:23.396 --> 01:13:26.158
I'm bilingual. You're
just <i>uno</i> Ebonical.

01:13:38.678 --> 01:13:44.410
Okay. See, keep it up, I'm not gonna
let you sleep with me tonight.

01:13:46.085 --> 01:13:49.586
That's fucked up. You're trying to
scare your way into some pussy.

01:13:49.689 --> 01:13:51.689
On the contrary, baby.
I don't want none.

01:13:51.791 --> 01:13:54.792
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really. Yeah.

01:13:54.894 --> 01:13:57.622
Because you way too much drama...

01:14:20.353 --> 01:14:21.647
Lucky?

01:14:21.754 --> 01:14:24.345
Yeah, I'm looking for
something for us to eat.

01:14:25.491 --> 01:14:27.957
Will you let me whup you
in some checkers later?

01:14:42.508 --> 01:14:44.769
It's... Get down.

01:15:34.027 --> 01:15:35.355
Bitch.

01:15:43.169 --> 01:15:44.497
Bitch!

01:15:56.316 --> 01:15:59.283
Okay. You're gonna
be all right, baby.

01:15:59.852 --> 01:16:02.045
- I gotta get you some help.
- No, don't leave me.

01:16:02.155 --> 01:16:03.745
Look, here.

01:16:06.326 --> 01:16:08.451
You keep this with you.

01:16:08.761 --> 01:16:10.055
Yeah.

01:16:10.163 --> 01:16:11.730
Now, I saw a farmhouse nearby.

01:16:11.831 --> 01:16:13.762
I'm gonna go there and
use their phone...

01:16:13.866 --> 01:16:16.992
call for an ambulance. Okay?

01:16:19.572 --> 01:16:21.003
Lucky?

01:16:21.407 --> 01:16:24.203
Yeah, I got you, baby. I got you.

01:16:26.012 --> 01:16:27.704
Leave the briefcase?

01:16:30.383 --> 01:16:32.781
I wanna know you're coming back.

01:16:35.154 --> 01:16:37.745
Of course I'm coming back.
Of course.

01:16:38.958 --> 01:16:42.824
But I mean, what if
somebody else shows up?

01:16:42.929 --> 01:16:45.930
Then you're passed out
and then the money...

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.661
Come on. Well, I think I'll...

01:16:51.604 --> 01:16:54.229
- I'll hide it somewhere.
- Please?

01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:58.504
Okay. Okay.

01:17:00.012 --> 01:17:01.875
I'll be back.

01:17:11.858 --> 01:17:13.721
You just said, "The ass of a rat."

01:17:16.396 --> 01:17:18.327
You teach me later.

01:17:21.634 --> 01:17:22.928
Don't go nowhere.

01:18:17.757 --> 01:18:19.757
Babe, I'll tell you what.

01:18:22.028 --> 01:18:23.959
You can fuck her first.

01:18:24.764 --> 01:18:26.195
Really?

01:18:26.299 --> 01:18:27.991
Flip for it?

01:18:29.635 --> 01:18:30.963
No.

01:18:31.204 --> 01:18:33.329
I'm in a watching kind of mood.

01:18:33.439 --> 01:18:36.064
Then you can have the first cut.

01:18:37.977 --> 01:18:39.567
Deal.

01:19:04.504 --> 01:19:07.334
Just imagine the worst possible
things you can imagine.

01:19:07.807 --> 01:19:11.843
When we're done, you're gonna know
how poor your imagination really is.

01:19:28.027 --> 01:19:30.152
Shit. Hey, babe? Babe?

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:32.520
- What?
- We gotta deal with this.

01:19:33.432 --> 01:19:36.399
Eugene's blasting the TV. This
joker's gonna know someone's home.

01:19:36.802 --> 01:19:38.233
Don't people know any better...

01:19:38.337 --> 01:19:40.928
than to just drop in like that?

01:19:44.844 --> 01:19:47.344
Please. I'm so sorry to bother you.

01:19:47.446 --> 01:19:50.913
We just had an accident in my place
across the way and the phone's out.

01:19:51.017 --> 01:19:53.312
Could you call an ambulance for us?

01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:57.881
I thought that belonged
to that mobster. Mendez?

01:19:59.392 --> 01:20:00.925
Really?

01:20:01.027 --> 01:20:03.755
Well, he just let us
borrow it for a while.

01:20:03.863 --> 01:20:05.487
I really need your help.

01:20:07.633 --> 01:20:08.722
Come on in.

01:20:08.834 --> 01:20:10.367
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

01:20:10.469 --> 01:20:12.298
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:20:12.939 --> 01:20:14.233
Have a seat.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:17.102
- Would you like a cookie or some tea?
- No, thank you.

01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:19.402
- I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Of course.

01:20:19.512 --> 01:20:21.239
I'll get the phone right away.

01:20:22.548 --> 01:20:25.208
Hey, hey, hey. Are you out
of your fricking mind?

01:20:25.318 --> 01:20:27.579
Go with me on this one, Walter.

01:20:30.723 --> 01:20:34.156
Lee, I passed the Sawtooth mill
twice, man. What the fuck?

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:35.588
<i>I... I don't know, captain.</i>

01:20:35.695 --> 01:20:37.285
<i>Franklin's truck's gotta be there.</i>

01:20:37.396 --> 01:20:39.054
<i>GPS says you're right
on top of him.</i>

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:45.532
Thank you.

01:20:45.638 --> 01:20:48.206
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:20:48.307 --> 01:20:50.272
I really appreciate this.

01:20:55.881 --> 01:20:57.949
This is not working.

01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:00.414
That would be because
I disconnected it.

01:21:06.258 --> 01:21:09.521
Now, this I do not understand.

01:21:22.408 --> 01:21:24.339
Police. Put your gun down.

01:21:24.443 --> 01:21:25.532
Put the shit down!

01:21:33.119 --> 01:21:34.709
Where's Lucky?

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.820
Probably in Mexico by now.

01:21:39.525 --> 01:21:40.956
<i>First...</i>

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.787
<i>there was a note.</i>

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:47.196
<i>Then there is no note.</i>

01:21:47.299 --> 01:21:50.527
What the fuck is going on?

01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:52.731
<i>They killed Roland.</i>

01:21:53.539 --> 01:21:57.336
- They can hear everything you say.
- <i>All in your mind.</i>

01:21:57.877 --> 01:21:59.410
<i>Good.</i>

01:22:00.246 --> 01:22:02.337
<i>Because I have had
a bad fucking day.</i>

01:22:02.515 --> 01:22:06.346
<i>And all these motherfuckers are
gonna do is keep pissing me off.</i>

01:22:06.452 --> 01:22:08.986
- <i>Illusion.</i>
- There's never a need for name-calling.

01:22:09.088 --> 01:22:11.486
What is meant to be is meant to be.

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:13.555
<i>We're all the children...</i>

01:22:13.659 --> 01:22:15.386
<i>of the universe.</i>

01:22:16.929 --> 01:22:19.725
<i>Breathe deeply.</i>

01:22:23.602 --> 01:22:26.500
They set us up to escape and
they just came right in...

01:22:26.605 --> 01:22:28.673
and they slit his throat.
He's a fighter.

01:22:28.774 --> 01:22:31.775
We were supposed to go to New
York. And they just killed him.

01:22:31.877 --> 01:22:35.504
<i>Hey, hey. Look. You're gonna have
to keep it together now, all right?</i>

01:22:35.681 --> 01:22:38.272
<i>Just keep it together.
Hold it together.</i>

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.777
Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

01:23:09.882 --> 01:23:11.449
That's right. Turn up, look at me.

01:23:11.884 --> 01:23:13.884
How you doing, black?
What's up, man?

01:23:13.986 --> 01:23:15.280
What's going on?

01:23:15.387 --> 01:23:17.250
Oh, you looking... What? What?

01:23:17.356 --> 01:23:19.390
What? Don't you know
what time it is, bro?

01:23:19.492 --> 01:23:23.119
I don't think you know what time it is!
Don't you know what time it is?

01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:25.126
It's showtime, motherfuckers!

01:23:25.231 --> 01:23:27.390
Your loss.

01:23:38.911 --> 01:23:40.740
What the fuck is this?

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:47.346
Hey, hey, hey. Are we in Mexico?

01:24:06.172 --> 01:24:07.830
Man, if you want an audition...

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:11.737
I can get you audition in
WWF or something, man.

01:24:11.844 --> 01:24:14.071
You need to let me go, man.

01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:25.518
Two points!

01:24:41.507 --> 01:24:43.040
You're not turning your punches.

01:24:46.011 --> 01:24:47.806
Stop tape!

01:24:53.085 --> 01:24:54.675
What are you talking about?

01:24:56.589 --> 01:25:00.352
You're not pronating your punches.

01:25:01.894 --> 01:25:03.655
Listen, man.

01:25:03.829 --> 01:25:05.988
I've studied martial
arts for 17 years.

01:25:06.098 --> 01:25:08.860
So don't you fucking criticize
my technique, okay?

01:25:11.002 --> 01:25:12.900
Always with a guy tied to a chair?

01:25:13.639 --> 01:25:16.173
Oh, yeah. So I suppose you
want me to let you go, right?

01:25:16.275 --> 01:25:18.070
If you were a man, you'd untie him.

01:25:18.177 --> 01:25:20.006
Oh, shit!

01:25:20.112 --> 01:25:22.737
Bill is back in the game!
Check that out, Cass.

01:25:22.848 --> 01:25:24.540
That's so cute.

01:25:26.785 --> 01:25:28.318
Where are we going?

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:30.181
I'm getting you to a hospital.

01:25:30.289 --> 01:25:33.358
That fucker said he was
going to get help.

01:25:33.459 --> 01:25:35.117
He left me.

01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:37.693
No, haven't I tried?
Have we done that before?

01:25:37.796 --> 01:25:39.386
You know, it's cool because...

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:45.870
If I can get him to knock this
chair over one more time...

01:25:46.472 --> 01:25:49.234
I can be free out of
this motherfucker.

01:25:51.343 --> 01:25:54.037
- No. No, they will not.
- Oh, yes, they will.

01:26:07.693 --> 01:26:09.590
I was saying...

01:26:10.195 --> 01:26:12.889
Hey, look. Before you introduce
me to Mr. Pinkie there...

01:26:13.465 --> 01:26:15.726
I don't suppose I could
interest you in a...

01:26:15.968 --> 01:26:19.595
suitcase full of money, could I?

01:26:20.139 --> 01:26:22.036
Well, I guess not.

01:26:22.608 --> 01:26:24.539
You wouldn't be interested
in the money...

01:26:24.643 --> 01:26:26.938
seeing how you and your
friend get your kicks.

01:26:27.046 --> 01:26:31.276
Coupled with the fact that a suitcase
full of money and a black man...

01:26:31.383 --> 01:26:34.452
Yeah, it's highly likely that there'd
be a strong police presence.

01:26:35.888 --> 01:26:38.650
- In the not-too-distant future.
- Ignore him, babe.

01:26:38.757 --> 01:26:40.290
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:40.426 --> 01:26:43.518
Why don't you let Bruce Lee
Light call all the shots?

01:26:45.097 --> 01:26:48.132
Do not provoke me.

01:26:49.301 --> 01:26:50.732
Look...

01:26:51.337 --> 01:26:53.667
I got a shitload of
money in a suitcase.

01:26:53.772 --> 01:26:55.430
I stashed it in a pickup truck.

01:26:55.541 --> 01:26:56.767
Cut, cut, cut!

01:26:56.875 --> 01:26:59.205
What is the first fucking rule?

01:26:59.311 --> 01:27:01.276
Do not let these tricks
get to you, babe!

01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:02.777
Don't talk to me like that.

01:27:02.982 --> 01:27:05.346
And they've got all those
dead cars out there anyway.

01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:08.145
Yeah, yeah, Bruce.
What do you gotta lose?

01:27:08.252 --> 01:27:09.877
Go check.

01:27:15.594 --> 01:27:16.820
I'll tell you this, bro.

01:27:16.929 --> 01:27:19.429
You got a lot to lose, man.

01:27:30.075 --> 01:27:33.338
What are you gonna do? Torture me?

01:27:33.445 --> 01:27:35.979
Oh, there's torture.

01:27:36.482 --> 01:27:40.382
And then there's torture.

01:27:43.188 --> 01:27:46.223
You think this is my week
away from the family?

01:27:47.559 --> 01:27:50.924
I know you but you don't know me.

01:27:51.764 --> 01:27:53.729
How many times have we
passed in the mall?

01:27:53.832 --> 01:27:55.923
You listen to that
gangster-rap shit...

01:27:56.234 --> 01:27:57.666
thinking you're hard.

01:27:59.104 --> 01:28:02.503
And you, with that
little, punky hair...

01:28:02.608 --> 01:28:04.334
always with the cruel remarks.

01:28:04.843 --> 01:28:09.277
"Look at the bitch with the
retarded child." All of you.

01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:13.047
Hurting Eugene all the
time he was a baby.

01:28:16.755 --> 01:28:18.720
But I make you pay.

01:28:19.591 --> 01:28:21.090
Don't I?

01:28:22.761 --> 01:28:24.988
Do you ever fucking learn?

01:28:27.066 --> 01:28:29.134
You think you know pain?

01:28:30.402 --> 01:28:34.029
Abu Ghraib ain't got nothing on us.

01:28:34.606 --> 01:28:36.867
I'll show you pain.

01:28:39.645 --> 01:28:41.542
She's so intense.

01:28:41.947 --> 01:28:44.413
Hey. What about the money?

01:28:49.221 --> 01:28:51.016
- Yeah, what about the money?
- The money?

01:28:51.123 --> 01:28:52.588
Yeah. Remember?

01:28:53.025 --> 01:28:56.218
The truck. Five minutes
away, outside?

01:28:56.328 --> 01:28:58.453
What the hell do you
expect to get in return?

01:28:58.564 --> 01:29:00.393
Well, sh... Look.

01:29:00.499 --> 01:29:04.091
Hey, you let me go and
I'll get you more of it.

01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:08.236
How about I take the
money, kill you...

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:10.965
and don't worry about
if there's any more?

01:29:13.145 --> 01:29:14.610
Underneath the hood.

01:29:20.786 --> 01:29:23.320
So, what is it with you and Lucky?

01:29:25.057 --> 01:29:27.318
We got a little history together.

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.823
I got time.

01:29:30.762 --> 01:29:33.695
Your boy, Lucky,
ruined a lot of lives.

01:29:36.168 --> 01:29:38.133
A lot of lives.

01:29:38.504 --> 01:29:40.629
Justice was never done.

01:29:42.174 --> 01:29:43.832
This time it will be.

01:29:52.651 --> 01:29:54.981
- Combination?
- It's not locked.

01:29:57.289 --> 01:29:59.949
Oh, wait... Wait a minute, babe.

01:30:00.559 --> 01:30:02.752
Let's get this shit on tape.

01:30:15.674 --> 01:30:17.298
Okay.

01:30:25.651 --> 01:30:28.218
- Are you ready yet?
- I'm all set, babe.

01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.926
Holy shit, Walter.
I think it's real.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.829
No, wait a minute! Wait a minute!

01:31:40.392 --> 01:31:43.393
- You expect me to beg?
- No.

01:31:43.795 --> 01:31:45.294
I expect you to scream.

01:31:57.709 --> 01:32:00.573
- Yeah.
- <i>Lucky just called TIPS.</i>

01:32:00.679 --> 01:32:03.612
- What?
- <i>Yeah. He wants to speak with you.</i>

01:32:03.715 --> 01:32:06.579
Run a trace. I'll try
to keep him talking.

01:32:07.219 --> 01:32:09.446
- Put him through.
- <i>Hey, Davis.</i>

01:32:09.554 --> 01:32:11.645
I got something you want.

01:32:12.357 --> 01:32:14.015
No more fucking deals this time.

01:32:14.126 --> 01:32:15.887
The Sawtooth Killers.

01:32:15.993 --> 01:32:18.084
You know the Sawtooth Killers?

01:32:18.697 --> 01:32:21.698
Yeah. I thought that
might shut you up.

01:32:21.933 --> 01:32:23.660
Well, I got the motherfuckers.

01:32:23.769 --> 01:32:25.996
- Why should I trust you?
- <i>Why should I trust you?</i>

01:32:26.104 --> 01:32:28.536
Come here, you'll see for yourself.

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.173
Bring an ambulance, all right?

01:32:30.475 --> 01:32:32.543
- Yeah, where are you?
- <i>Oh, man, come on.</i>

01:32:32.644 --> 01:32:34.644
Come on, man.
Sh... like you don't know.

01:32:36.682 --> 01:32:38.443
- Lee, got that?
- <i>You won't believe it.</i>

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:40.277
- <i>He's back where you came from.</i>
- What?

01:32:40.385 --> 01:32:42.953
<i>The old farmhouse, five minutes
away, north of the mill.</i>

01:32:43.055 --> 01:32:44.383
- <i>Can you get there?</i>
- Yeah.

01:32:44.489 --> 01:32:47.956
- <i>All right. I'll get the guys in motion.</i>
- I'm on it.

01:33:12.751 --> 01:33:14.216
About time.

01:33:14.319 --> 01:33:17.445
Look. The Sawtooth Killers?

01:33:17.889 --> 01:33:19.513
You wanna see?

01:33:19.691 --> 01:33:21.019
Right over there.

01:33:25.364 --> 01:33:27.227
Yeah. Right there.

01:33:28.767 --> 01:33:32.234
That crazy bitch. And the Mexican.

01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:37.369
They murdered my boyfriend.

01:33:38.076 --> 01:33:40.906
- They were gonna kill us next.
- Who are you?

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:43.609
Rainn Bentley.

01:33:44.082 --> 01:33:46.082
This man saved my life.

01:33:46.618 --> 01:33:48.777
Look, they even filmed their shit.

01:33:48.887 --> 01:33:51.512
All the crazy shit they
do, they got it on tape.

01:33:52.124 --> 01:33:54.419
They got it caught on tape.
Right in there.

01:33:55.026 --> 01:33:57.617
- I gotta go.
- Hey.

01:33:57.729 --> 01:33:59.194
Hold up.

01:33:59.698 --> 01:34:01.095
Think this makes things even?

01:34:01.333 --> 01:34:03.765
Look, hey, man. Look, I got
a woman I gotta go to.

01:34:03.868 --> 01:34:04.936
Who's that, Angela?

01:34:07.706 --> 01:34:09.433
She's outside.

01:34:18.049 --> 01:34:20.140
Mama!

01:34:36.067 --> 01:34:37.156
Crazy motherfucker!

01:34:57.789 --> 01:34:58.947
All right.

01:35:00.692 --> 01:35:02.760
I'll have the charges
against you dropped.

01:35:05.764 --> 01:35:07.422
I'll get you an ambulance.

01:35:09.501 --> 01:35:11.000
Go on.

01:35:14.573 --> 01:35:16.300
Solid.

01:35:23.281 --> 01:35:24.814
Hey.

01:35:26.284 --> 01:35:28.579
Hey, it's over. Come on.

01:35:28.687 --> 01:35:30.584
Come on up. It's over.

01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:33.582
It's over, all right?

01:35:33.692 --> 01:35:35.589
Okay, come on.

01:35:36.627 --> 01:35:38.457
Okay.

01:35:53.712 --> 01:35:55.837
I trusted you and you
didn't come back.

01:35:55.947 --> 01:35:57.487
- Baby, I was...
- Where's the money?

01:35:57.582 --> 01:36:00.845
- The money? I was... It was...
- Oh, you're purple! Hell, no!

01:36:13.798 --> 01:36:16.560
<i>Well, when I look back on it...</i>

01:36:16.668 --> 01:36:20.329
<i>that was the luckiest day
in an unlucky man's life.</i>

01:36:20.438 --> 01:36:23.166
- <i>Tell them about the money, baby.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:36:23.275 --> 01:36:28.312
<i>And as luck would have
it, me and Angela...</i>

01:36:28.446 --> 01:36:32.744
<i>collected that $200,000
reward money too.</i>

01:36:33.984 --> 01:36:35.643
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

01:36:36.054 --> 01:36:37.950
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
