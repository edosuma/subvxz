I could start
smoking crack today,

10:22.205 --> 10:23.707
and he'd still turn
out better than you!

10:23.790 --> 10:26.634
And why is that? Because I
never had a father, Lana.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.258
So why don't you shut up
and then also marry me?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.055
What?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.132
I'm serious!

10:32.215 --> 10:34.309
We can go underground,
get new identities,

10:34.384 --> 10:36.478
and spend the rest of our
lives together, Lana.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.523
We'll be a family!
You, me, the baby,

10:39.597 --> 10:41.895
and your
not-that-weird-looking vagina!

10:41.975 --> 10:45.479
Okay, don't take
this the wrong way,

10:45.562 --> 10:47.860
but I would
rather lose the baby,

10:47.939 --> 10:49.065
Uh... Uh...

10:50.233 --> 10:52.827
Okay, that wasn't...
I didn't...

come on?

on record as saying

12:05.642 --> 12:08.566

an extremely bad idea?

12:08.645 --> 12:11.194

a bad idea? Prison.

Darn, all those jobs
are awesome.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.117
And by awesome,
you mean delusional,

be hard to go back

Although,
I guess I could always

go back lo being

(INDISTINCT TALKING) When
were you ever a lawyer?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.891

tries to run, but he don't get far!

Are you done?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.118
Again, seriously asking,

15:52.201 --> 15:55.671
Yes. So I guess we should talk
about the elephant in the room,

15:55.746 --> 15:56.793
Namely...

15:57.498 --> 16:00.672
What are we gonna do with
literally, not figuratively,

16:00.751 --> 16:02.378

16:13.181 --> 16:15.900
(LAUGHS) Wholesale.
So what, we form a cartel?

16:16.767 --> 16:18.235
Well, how hard could it be?
I mean...

16:18.311 --> 16:19.312
Don't!
