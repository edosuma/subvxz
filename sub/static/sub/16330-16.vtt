00:00.460 --> 00:02.662
Previously on "Blindspot."

00:05.739 --> 00:06.994
I know you're using.

00:07.029 --> 00:08.814
I don't know how bad it is, but I know.

00:08.849 --> 00:10.349
You gotta learn how to relax.

00:11.718 --> 00:13.658
I have a court document that says that

00:13.693 --> 00:16.221
- he changed his name 12 years ago.
- Why would he do that?

00:16.256 --> 00:17.751
Did you change your name?

00:17.786 --> 00:20.587
You were the one who said you
didn't wanna talk about the past.

00:20.622 --> 00:22.628
I'm gonna go.

00:23.567 --> 00:24.572
This is from my source.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.264
He's given me coordinates on the dead drop.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.532
Uhh!

00:52.025 --> 00:53.725
Gah! Uhh!

00:59.666 --> 01:02.567
Who are you? Who sent you?

01:10.519 --> 01:12.828
- There you go.
- They were... right?

01:12.863 --> 01:14.179
What're we toasting to?

01:14.214 --> 01:15.584
- No.
- Yes.

01:15.619 --> 01:16.349
- Come on.
- Really?

01:16.384 --> 01:18.253
You gonna make us do this every round?

01:18.288 --> 01:20.206
Yes! It's bad luck

01:20.241 --> 01:22.040
to take a shot without toasting.

01:22.075 --> 01:24.956
- Says who?
- Says my Uncle Ricky.

01:24.991 --> 01:27.477
- Oh.
- And everyone else.

01:27.512 --> 01:29.793
Cheers to Uncle Ricky.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.363
Drink up.

01:31.398 --> 01:33.238
Hey, there she is.

01:33.273 --> 01:36.435
Wait, I thought you had that thing.

01:37.190 --> 01:38.850
I... I had to reschedule.

01:38.885 --> 01:40.842
Jane, true or false:

01:40.877 --> 01:44.036
it's bad luck to take
a shot without toasting.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.974
Uh, false?

01:46.009 --> 01:48.514
- Done!
- Whatever, she has amnesia.

01:51.259 --> 01:53.130
You're many drinks
behind. Let's catch you up.

01:53.165 --> 01:55.567
- Yeah, so you two...
- So much liquor.

01:55.602 --> 01:56.881
...kill that bottle.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.824
- Okay.
- It's time to get to the real good stuff.

01:58.859 --> 02:00.392
Oh, now we move on to the good stuff?

02:00.427 --> 02:01.764
Mmm.

02:01.799 --> 02:03.195
Mm-hmm.

02:05.377 --> 02:07.309
So, when did Oliver reschedule for?

02:07.344 --> 02:09.657
Uh, we're gonna figure it out.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.820
You told him you ran a
background check on him,

02:11.855 --> 02:14.347
- and he freaked out.
- Pretty much.

02:14.382 --> 02:16.129
Did he at least say
why he changed his name?

02:16.164 --> 02:18.369
Uh, no, we didn't get that far.

02:18.404 --> 02:19.772
He was pretty hung up on the whole

02:19.807 --> 02:21.780
"massive invasion of privacy" thing.

02:21.815 --> 02:23.835
Boys.

02:23.870 --> 02:24.707
So sensitive.

02:26.899 --> 02:30.292
Listen, about before...

02:30.327 --> 02:31.977
Patterson, stay out of my business.

02:32.012 --> 02:34.128
I am not trying to be nosy.

02:34.163 --> 02:37.829
You're my friend, and
I'm worried about you.

03:01.062 --> 03:03.328
Sorry, I was just, um...

03:03.363 --> 03:04.502
Snooping?

03:04.537 --> 03:06.348
No, no, um...

03:06.390 --> 03:08.585
- Uh-huh?
- Maybe a little bit, yeah.

03:10.626 --> 03:12.978
You did a really nice job.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.266
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.728
Put it all together before I knew that...

03:17.948 --> 03:19.729
Allie was moving.

03:22.126 --> 03:23.196
So, after the baby's born,

03:23.258 --> 03:26.103
are you just... gonna
go back and forth, or...

03:26.565 --> 03:28.676
I'm sorry, it's none of my business.

03:28.711 --> 03:30.274
No, it's okay.

03:30.309 --> 03:32.609
I don't know what we're gonna do.

03:34.737 --> 03:36.504
Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.061
- It's Nas.
- Hmm?

03:42.131 --> 03:43.372
She's been attacked.

03:47.971 --> 03:50.327
The doctors are still checking on Nas.

03:50.462 --> 03:51.401
She seems okay.

03:51.447 --> 03:53.732
Any idea who attacked her?

03:53.818 --> 03:56.780
Shepherd must've caught wind
that Nas's source had reached out.

03:56.874 --> 04:00.572
I wanted to stop Nas from getting this.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.969
It's yours... whatever's on that

04:03.050 --> 04:04.499
was worth killing or dying for.

04:04.562 --> 04:07.053
- So it must be big.
- Or it was a decoy.

04:07.088 --> 04:09.370
Nas's source has been dark for a year.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.861
Then out of the blue he
re-establishes contact?

04:11.939 --> 04:13.865
Think he was setting her up for an ambush?

04:13.944 --> 04:15.949
No, he's always given her valuable intel.

04:16.019 --> 04:17.302
I mean, he told her about me being dropped

04:17.348 --> 04:18.615
in Times Square before it happened.

04:18.685 --> 04:20.688
Yeah, and he also gave Nas key details

04:20.723 --> 04:23.921
on Sandstorm's org chart,
Shepherd's interest in me.

04:23.956 --> 04:25.668
It doesn't make sense that he
suddenly turned against her.

04:25.746 --> 04:27.976
Okay, what if it wasn't him on the call?

04:28.062 --> 04:30.976
Sandstorm could've gotten that
number and used it to set up a trap.

04:31.039 --> 04:34.262
Whoa, this drive is crazy encrypted.

04:34.297 --> 04:36.723
This is a lot of work for a decoy.

04:36.758 --> 04:38.469
How long is it gonna
take you to decrypt it?

04:38.521 --> 04:41.418
All night, at least.

04:41.453 --> 04:43.253
I need you to keep working on it.

04:47.135 --> 04:49.932
Hey, are you okay?

04:50.018 --> 04:52.052
Shepherd's always one step ahead of us.

04:52.122 --> 04:55.807
First, the HMX sale,
Sean Clark, and now this.

04:55.877 --> 04:58.569
So when are we gonna get a break? When?

04:58.653 --> 05:00.937
Listen, we're gonna get her.

05:00.999 --> 05:03.800
Okay, I know something is on that drive.

05:12.429 --> 05:14.137
What's-her-face is kinda
cute, with the hair.

05:14.172 --> 05:15.712
- Oh...
- What?

05:15.747 --> 05:18.190
Agents Reade and Zapata.
It's your lucky day.

05:18.225 --> 05:19.490
The hot water's working in the showers?

05:19.525 --> 05:21.255
We finally have soft
serve at the commissary?

05:21.290 --> 05:23.097
Close... you've been selected

05:23.132 --> 05:24.516
for today's random drug screen.

05:24.551 --> 05:27.190
Oh, I don't think you understand
the definition of "lucky."

05:27.225 --> 05:28.613
- It'll just take a few minutes.
- Couldn't you have,

05:28.675 --> 05:30.648
like, given us a heads-up on this?

05:30.683 --> 05:33.071
I don't think you understand
the definition of "random."

05:37.701 --> 05:38.735
Agent Reade?

05:39.851 --> 05:43.204
I'm coming down with
something. I got a stomach bug.

05:43.239 --> 05:46.101
I'm afraid I can't let you out of my sight
until you've completed the drug screen.

05:46.153 --> 05:47.023
No, seriously, I should get home...

05:47.058 --> 05:49.716
Sorry... Bureau policy.

05:57.168 --> 05:58.522
You have to eat.

05:58.774 --> 06:00.076
I'm not hungry.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.619
You still sleeping on the floor?

06:02.728 --> 06:04.317
I like the floor.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.516
No one likes the floor, Roman.

06:06.652 --> 06:08.798
Those sheets feel like steel wool.

06:11.764 --> 06:13.931
So, what'd you do last night?

06:13.986 --> 06:16.466
- Mmm...
- Okay, I'll start.

06:16.513 --> 06:19.009
I counted the concrete seams in my cell.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.911
117, if you were wondering.

06:23.538 --> 06:27.621
Um, I went for a... a
quick drink with the team.

06:28.396 --> 06:30.489
What about that guy you're seeing?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.548
The, uh, the one who sent the flowers.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.224
We're kind of on the outs.

06:34.828 --> 06:38.828
You don't need to feel
guilty for your social life.

06:43.106 --> 06:45.239
I just don't like seeing you like this.

06:46.943 --> 06:49.572
Look, I... I know I don't have much,

06:49.646 --> 06:52.041
but what little I do have, I owe to you.

06:57.491 --> 06:58.897
Hey, how are you?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.617
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.074
You should've seen the other guy.

07:04.688 --> 07:06.055
All right, what do you got?

07:06.090 --> 07:07.449
I decoded the USB.

07:07.484 --> 07:11.229
It had a username and
password for an FTP site.

07:11.292 --> 07:13.944
And I was just about to
log in when you got here.

07:16.444 --> 07:19.071
- That's Shepherd.
- And Borden.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.628
What else can you get from these files?

07:20.683 --> 07:22.453
Location? Timestamp?

07:22.531 --> 07:24.417
The metadata's been wiped.

07:24.499 --> 07:26.533
Zoom in on that newspaper box.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.514
That's yesterday's paper.

07:29.567 --> 07:31.047
These were taken less than 24 hours ago.

07:31.082 --> 07:33.683
That's my inside source phone.

07:37.527 --> 07:39.700
<i>I see you've logged
onto my FTP site.</i>

07:39.746 --> 07:41.383
I'm lucky I got out with my life.

07:41.450 --> 07:44.207
Obviously Shepherd doesn't
want you seeing those photos.

07:44.272 --> 07:47.124
I can see why. You've got quite the eye.

07:47.254 --> 07:48.321
Where were they taken?

07:48.395 --> 07:50.320
<i>It doesn't matter where
Shepherd was yesterday.</i>

07:50.420 --> 07:52.624
<i>It matters where she's
going to be today.</i>

07:52.687 --> 07:55.427
- And you know?
- <i>Yes.</i>

07:55.511 --> 07:56.510
Prove it.

08:02.001 --> 08:04.565
<i>This needs to happen tomorrow.</i>

08:04.635 --> 08:06.994
<i>You just tell Shepherd
to be there at 3:00.</i>

08:07.083 --> 08:08.405
<i>She'll be there.</i>

08:08.459 --> 08:11.475
Who's Borden talking to?
Where's Shepherd going to be?

08:11.553 --> 08:13.956
<i>Bring $500,000 in unmarked bills</i>

08:14.034 --> 08:17.397
<i>to Trinity Plaza at noon,
and I'll tell you the rest.</i>

08:17.473 --> 08:19.298
<i>Come alone.</i>

08:19.333 --> 08:20.586
Who is this guy?

08:20.621 --> 08:21.785
He's the guy who's about to put us

08:21.820 --> 08:24.240
a step ahead of Shepherd.

08:29.523 --> 08:34.523
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

08:41.812 --> 08:43.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.347
I just talked to Nas...
you're sending a scout team

08:45.382 --> 08:47.482
to Trinity Plaza before the meet?

08:47.552 --> 08:49.044
Well, we need to know
what we're dealing with

08:49.091 --> 08:50.419
before we do anything else.

08:50.454 --> 08:52.853
If Nas's inside man
sees any sign of agents,

08:52.916 --> 08:54.750
he could get spooked and cancel the drop.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.919
If we don't check it out first,

08:55.974 --> 08:58.068
then we could be sending
Nas into another trap.

08:58.131 --> 08:59.997
Now, this guy hasn't
asked for money before.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.117
Something doesn't feel right.

09:01.188 --> 09:04.106
Maybe he's trying to get out for
good and needs the money to run.

09:04.173 --> 09:05.936
We keep taking these risks, Jane,

09:05.994 --> 09:08.054
and getting our asses
kicked. I'm sick of it.

09:08.126 --> 09:09.983
We need to start playing smarter.

09:10.061 --> 09:13.000
This is the best lead we've
had on Shepherd so far.

09:13.035 --> 09:15.803
What if we lose it?

09:15.838 --> 09:17.162
The Confidential Informant Unit.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.839
They're putting together the cash.

09:18.874 --> 09:21.542
If the plaza checks
out, then we send Nas in.

09:21.577 --> 09:23.443
Not before.

09:28.983 --> 09:30.585
Agent Mary Crone?

09:30.650 --> 09:31.783
Here.

09:35.389 --> 09:37.724
What was with that whole
going home sick thing?

09:37.759 --> 09:39.826
You were fine at the gym this morning.

09:41.053 --> 09:43.922
Oh, yeah, um...

09:43.957 --> 09:45.290
just don't feel well.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.256
I told you not to have that last scotch.

09:49.303 --> 09:52.063
You handle your hard
liquor like a pre-teen.

09:53.717 --> 09:56.095
Oh, what, you worried you're gonna fail?

09:56.179 --> 09:58.937
I know you have a soft spot
for those poppy-seed muffins.

09:58.972 --> 10:00.339
Yeah.

10:00.451 --> 10:02.867
Agent Edgar Reade?

10:03.709 --> 10:05.043
You're next.

10:26.394 --> 10:28.228
Stay sharp, team.

10:28.318 --> 10:31.920
- Nobody moves until I do.
- Copy.

10:31.955 --> 10:33.989
- <i>Copy.</i>
- <i>Copy.</i>

10:42.832 --> 10:46.201
Our source probably has a
cutout picking up the drop.

10:46.236 --> 10:50.138
So whoever takes that money, stay on them.

10:56.471 --> 10:58.005
I'm here.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.406
<i>You look like a tourist.</i>

10:59.466 --> 11:01.800
- <i>Nice gym bag.</i>
- Thanks.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.279
It was quite expensive.

11:03.344 --> 11:06.037
<i>Meet me on the fifth floor
of St. Joseph's Hospital.</i>

11:38.166 --> 11:40.901
<i>Walk toward the laundry
cart around to your left.</i>

11:48.522 --> 11:50.157
<i>Drop the bag in the cart.</i>

11:50.192 --> 11:52.554
Where are you? I want to meet.

11:52.642 --> 11:54.542
<i>Drop the cash, or the deal's off.</i>

11:59.245 --> 12:01.962
It's in the cart... now,
where is Shepherd's meeting?

12:01.997 --> 12:03.571
<i>Exit the building.
Once you're outside,</i>

12:03.625 --> 12:05.872
<i>I'll give you her location.</i>

12:08.176 --> 12:09.643
Hang back.

12:09.678 --> 12:11.044
Wait for the pickup.

12:23.891 --> 12:25.091
Stop!

12:25.516 --> 12:27.460
Stop! Come on!

12:27.745 --> 12:29.161
- Who told you to drop that bag?
- I don't know.

12:29.196 --> 12:31.120
Some guy paid me a hundred bucks.

12:31.190 --> 12:32.766
Turn around.

12:32.801 --> 12:34.676
All right... team,

12:34.736 --> 12:36.569
that money's been dropped
down the laundry chute.

12:36.604 --> 12:38.392
Go! Move to the basement now.

12:38.450 --> 12:39.883
They'll never reach him in time.

12:41.054 --> 12:42.175
Jane!

12:49.450 --> 12:50.393
I've got eyes on the target!

12:50.440 --> 12:52.340
Basement, heading toward the north exit.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.060
Don't move.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.779
Cade?

13:02.863 --> 13:04.564
Former Sandstorm operative.

13:04.599 --> 13:07.027
- He went rogue.
- And tried to kill all of us.

13:07.156 --> 13:09.924
Drop the gun. Do it now.

13:18.644 --> 13:19.978
Uhh!

13:37.365 --> 13:38.328
Okay...

13:38.390 --> 13:40.480
We're on the same side.

13:40.542 --> 13:41.735
I doubt that.

13:41.770 --> 13:43.669
I killed Oscar.

13:47.010 --> 13:49.570
FBI, keep your hands where I can see 'em.

13:49.686 --> 13:50.344
Cade?

13:50.381 --> 13:52.538
He's been after us ever
since he tried to kill Jane.

13:52.573 --> 13:54.581
He must've intercepted
the call from my source.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.816
Intercept?

13:56.851 --> 13:58.551
I am your source!

14:13.401 --> 14:15.951
So, you should have your
results back by end of day.

14:24.518 --> 14:26.437
What is it? Pot? Adderall?

14:26.496 --> 14:27.562
No.

14:27.738 --> 14:29.128
Coke?

14:30.677 --> 14:31.844
It was just a couple times.

14:31.879 --> 14:33.207
I was just blowing off some steam.

14:33.242 --> 14:35.118
Blowing off some steam is a few beers.

14:35.153 --> 14:36.356
That's a schedule two narcotic.

14:36.411 --> 14:38.022
It's not that serious.

14:38.057 --> 14:40.257
Not that serious? You're
about to fail an FBI drug test.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.152
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:42.207 --> 14:44.195
Do you wanna say it any louder?

14:44.230 --> 14:45.763
You have to tell Weller.

14:45.798 --> 14:48.045
I'm serious. Get ahead of this.

14:48.092 --> 14:50.490
Better he hears it from
you than from some OPR suit.

14:50.552 --> 14:51.569
He'll lose his damn mind.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.638
No, he knows you've been going through
a lot, he will cut you some slack.

14:54.673 --> 14:56.255
- We're a family.
- Oh, please.

14:56.290 --> 14:58.369
That's just what people say.

14:58.404 --> 15:01.394
He's my boss, and it'll be
his job to tell his boss.

15:01.429 --> 15:02.778
So, what's the alternative?

15:02.833 --> 15:05.745
It leaves your system in 24 to 48 hours.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.819
When's the last time you used?

15:07.940 --> 15:09.991
- Yesterday morning.
- In the morning?

15:13.737 --> 15:15.481
So, you're still within the window.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.321
Yeah.

15:20.893 --> 15:21.953
_

15:21.988 --> 15:23.789
- They caught Cade.
- How?

15:23.824 --> 15:25.036
Guess we're about to find out.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.455
Let's get changed.

15:26.539 --> 15:28.306
And talk to Weller, please?

15:28.787 --> 15:30.769
Sure, now's the perfect time.

15:37.616 --> 15:40.870
You know anything about
me being drug tested today?

15:40.930 --> 15:43.020
No.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.761
Timing seems a little funny.

15:44.846 --> 15:47.547
Agents can't call for random drug tests.

15:49.003 --> 15:50.417
They're random.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.185
All right, hey.

15:56.008 --> 15:57.702
You're wasting valuable time.

15:57.737 --> 15:59.937
I know where Shepherd's gonna
be in 90 minutes, not after that.

16:00.021 --> 16:01.705
We'll tell you when we're wasting time.

16:02.354 --> 16:04.686
So... start at the beginning.

16:04.757 --> 16:05.902
Well, in the beginning, there was nothing,

16:05.972 --> 16:08.331
and then the universe
started rapidly expanding.

16:08.366 --> 16:10.581
For a guy who's worried about
time, you seem to have a lot of it.

16:10.616 --> 16:12.711
- What do you want to know?
- Why you contacted me.

16:12.774 --> 16:14.128
Why you turned against Shepherd.

16:14.189 --> 16:15.922
Because I found out who she really is.

16:18.337 --> 16:20.494
Look, I grew up in a mining town.

16:20.557 --> 16:23.127
Mom died in labor, old man was all I had.

16:24.362 --> 16:27.398
He died on the job. Faulty mine shaft.

16:27.433 --> 16:30.207
Or a... what, an "act of God,"

16:30.269 --> 16:32.093
according to the company lawyers.

16:33.135 --> 16:35.184
I wanted those bastards to pay.

16:35.345 --> 16:38.609
Tried to stage a few pickets,
it didn't make much difference.

16:38.701 --> 16:40.022
Joined the Marine Corps,

16:40.068 --> 16:41.946
didn't find any answers there.

16:41.981 --> 16:45.062
I was... broken.

16:45.141 --> 16:46.648
And that's when Shepherd found you.

16:46.687 --> 16:48.119
Yeah, she saw I was hurting.

16:48.154 --> 16:49.569
Saw a bruise she could press on.

16:49.624 --> 16:50.888
She's good at that.

16:50.923 --> 16:52.495
Said she had a better answer.

16:52.530 --> 16:54.595
A way we could bring justice

16:54.630 --> 16:57.923
to the people who killed
my dad and others like them.

16:57.997 --> 17:00.837
I was all in. I became her loyal soldier.

17:00.872 --> 17:02.133
Until?

17:02.234 --> 17:03.434
<i>Till the night I found
out that Shepherd</i>

17:03.469 --> 17:05.707
<i>doesn't care about helping people.</i>

17:05.785 --> 17:07.226
<i>Shepherd cares about Shepherd.</i>

17:07.277 --> 17:09.007
<i>Everyone else is dispensable.</i>

17:09.069 --> 17:10.512
You learned about Phase Two.

17:10.584 --> 17:12.384
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:12.545 --> 17:14.983
So, like you were saying before,

17:15.078 --> 17:16.881
how many civilians?

17:16.936 --> 17:18.849
A lot... but if their deaths

17:18.919 --> 17:21.053
save this country from tyranny,

17:21.349 --> 17:22.894
it's worth it.

17:22.965 --> 17:24.143
That's what Phase Two is about.

17:24.178 --> 17:26.041
Enough, Roman!

17:26.094 --> 17:27.448
Parker's looking for you.

17:34.848 --> 17:36.807
Those details
are need-to-know.

17:36.842 --> 17:38.895
- I'm sorry.
- I don't need you to be sorry.

17:38.979 --> 17:40.578
I need you to be smart.

17:46.169 --> 17:47.713
<i>Rooting out corruption is one thing,</i>

17:47.775 --> 17:49.818
<i>but I never wanted
innocent people to die.</i>

17:49.853 --> 17:52.141
So Roman gave you details about Phase Two.

17:52.176 --> 17:53.774
I just knew it was gonna be deadly.

17:53.809 --> 17:55.976
I tried to get more, but
on the high-level details,

17:56.038 --> 17:58.614
- Shepherd kept a tight lid.
- I don't buy it.

17:58.738 --> 18:00.974
If you were so angry, why did you stay?

18:01.021 --> 18:03.235
Because I knew I could do
more damage on the inside.

18:03.369 --> 18:05.036
That's when I started leaking to you.

18:05.848 --> 18:07.779
Your story doesn't add up.

18:07.841 --> 18:09.866
You didn't want innocents to die,

18:09.944 --> 18:11.903
yet you tried to kill me and my team.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.636
That was never about you.

18:13.688 --> 18:15.950
That was about taking out
Shepherd's Trojan horse.

18:15.985 --> 18:18.459
Stop Jane Doe, end it
before it even begins.

18:18.522 --> 18:20.067
No, it was personal.

18:20.129 --> 18:22.446
You went after Jane for
revenge against Oscar.

18:22.508 --> 18:25.587
Yeah, it was both, because
Oscar killed someone I loved.

18:25.622 --> 18:27.009
He killed Markos.

18:27.044 --> 18:28.044
You can't trust him.

18:31.382 --> 18:33.553
He was a Marine, like me.

18:33.632 --> 18:36.185
<i>He had no family, like me.</i>

18:38.621 --> 18:40.560
Markos made me whole.

18:40.638 --> 18:43.950
And when Oscar took him away from me...

18:44.010 --> 18:46.032
it was like I lost my
family all over again.

18:47.086 --> 18:49.544
<i>Last time I had a run-in with
you guys, I went underground.</i>

18:49.579 --> 18:51.698
I've been trying to track Shepherd,
and last week, I found her.

18:51.770 --> 18:53.251
But I can't take her army out alone.

18:53.305 --> 18:55.500
- How'd you track her?
- I know their safehouses.

18:55.564 --> 18:57.664
Their contacts. Even Shepherd has patterns.

18:57.742 --> 18:59.028
That's how I know where
she's gonna be today.

18:59.087 --> 19:00.949
Where?

19:01.004 --> 19:03.332
Where's the 500K you guys owe me?

19:03.567 --> 19:06.098
Also, I want a guarantee

19:06.176 --> 19:08.228
that I can walk away free after this.

19:10.117 --> 19:12.161
Well, I've got the keys to those cuffs,

19:12.196 --> 19:13.484
you're not walking anywhere.

19:13.524 --> 19:15.025
You got no leverage.

19:15.082 --> 19:17.485
I know the location of the most
wanted terrorist in the world,

19:17.547 --> 19:19.695
and my intel's only good for another...

19:19.777 --> 19:22.067
86 minutes.

19:25.035 --> 19:26.969
That's the definition of leverage.

19:29.233 --> 19:31.597
Kurt, stop being so
stubborn and talk this out.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.815
There is no way in hell
that I'm gonna cut a deal

19:33.850 --> 19:35.598
- with that psychopath.
- But this is war.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.529
Sometimes we need to align
ourselves with people we don't...

19:37.615 --> 19:40.461
He tried to kill Jane!
He should be in prison.

19:40.524 --> 19:42.651
Not taking a world tour on the FBI's dime!

19:44.718 --> 19:46.753
Kurt, he's not a psychopath.

19:46.788 --> 19:49.392
He's trying to stop
Shepherd, just like we are.

19:49.918 --> 19:52.045
Now, we have to put our
personal baggage aside.

19:52.131 --> 19:53.729
Like you did with me.

19:55.370 --> 19:56.750
That was different, Jane.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.338
I remember you telling
Zapata you didn't even

19:58.373 --> 20:00.207
wanna be in the same room with me.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.046
But we had a common enemy.

20:02.081 --> 20:04.316
This is our best chance
to take Shepherd down.

20:04.351 --> 20:06.451
Stop her before she attacks.

20:08.090 --> 20:11.410
Shepherd uses a fixer to smuggle
operatives in and out of the country.

20:11.487 --> 20:13.272
Yeah, Shepherd told me about this guy.

20:13.307 --> 20:14.528
That's who Borden was
meeting with yesterday,

20:14.591 --> 20:16.119
that's where Shepherd's gonna be today.

20:16.186 --> 20:17.881
Why would she risk going herself?

20:17.945 --> 20:19.521
Seems below her pay grade.

20:19.591 --> 20:22.061
Unless she's the one getting smuggled out.

20:22.163 --> 20:24.533
Why would Shepherd flee
before Phase Two's over?

20:24.568 --> 20:27.715
Maybe she doesn't wanna stick
around for the aftermath.

20:27.770 --> 20:28.885
Look, whatever the reason,

20:28.940 --> 20:31.367
if we don't catch her now,
we could lose her forever.

20:32.452 --> 20:34.724
Fixer works out of a copy
store in East Rutherford.

20:34.789 --> 20:37.350
- They're meeting at 3:00.
- So we beat her there,

20:37.420 --> 20:39.288
take her down when she arrives.

20:39.382 --> 20:41.587
We don't have much time, let's move.

20:42.594 --> 20:43.681
Thank you, Cade.

20:43.745 --> 20:45.344
Thank me when you get Shepherd.

20:50.572 --> 20:52.625
We've got half an hour
until Shepherd gets here.

20:52.688 --> 20:54.963
Beta team, I want you to
enter from the rear exit.

20:55.047 --> 20:58.701
- Reade, Tasha, I want you...
- Wait... is that smoke?

20:58.814 --> 21:00.985
Fire in the building... everyone move in.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.547
Send in the fire department.

21:20.739 --> 21:21.805
Blood.

21:24.346 --> 21:25.746
We got a body.

21:31.496 --> 21:32.829
He's dead.

21:35.356 --> 21:37.111
Cade sold us out.

21:44.376 --> 21:45.923
You're still working
with Shepherd, aren't you?

21:45.973 --> 21:48.070
What's going on? You sandbagged us!

21:48.136 --> 21:49.831
We got to the meet half an hour early,

21:49.914 --> 21:51.402
but somehow Shepherd beat us there

21:51.484 --> 21:54.224
- and killed the fixer.
- That's... That's not possible.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.755
- It is if you tipped them off.
- Why the hell would I do that?

21:56.870 --> 21:58.467
I've risked my life to
help you bring her down.

21:58.502 --> 22:01.144
Not to mention I've
been in custody all day!

22:01.202 --> 22:02.913
How would I have even gotten word out?

22:05.078 --> 22:06.922
Maybe someone on your team leaked it.

22:08.344 --> 22:09.849
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

22:09.904 --> 22:12.663
You were surrounded by your band of
merry men when I told you about the meet.

22:12.725 --> 22:14.797
Maybe you've got a mole.

22:14.836 --> 22:16.314
My team is ironclad.

22:17.348 --> 22:18.548
<i>Like Borden?</i>

22:21.286 --> 22:22.968
You okay?

22:23.003 --> 22:24.199
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.790
I just got a crazy migraine coming on.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.206
Excuse me.

22:30.121 --> 22:32.370
<i>Get your own glass house in order
before you start throwing stones.</i>

22:32.438 --> 22:34.752
Look, if you knew Borden was the
mole, why didn't you tell Nas?

22:34.824 --> 22:37.733
I didn't know until I saw
him with Shepherd this week!

22:37.784 --> 22:41.122
I was just a soldier, I was never
given every piece of the plan.

22:41.269 --> 22:43.243
Let's go. It's a dead end.

22:43.312 --> 22:44.545
Wait.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.878
Even if he doesn't know where Shepherd is,

22:47.958 --> 22:49.757
he could still be useful.

22:56.965 --> 22:58.974
How the high and mighty have fallen.

23:00.290 --> 23:01.745
Did we know each other?

23:01.803 --> 23:03.277
Yeah, we knew each other.

23:05.515 --> 23:07.028
Were we friends?

23:07.143 --> 23:10.173
Yeah, I thought we were...
till you spent six months

23:10.220 --> 23:12.387
trying to track me down and kill me.

23:12.473 --> 23:13.933
Almost caught me once.

23:14.039 --> 23:16.064
Missed me by, like, two minutes.

23:16.142 --> 23:17.218
Now look at you.

23:17.276 --> 23:20.410
I don't know whether to choke you
or feed you soup... maybe both.

23:21.368 --> 23:23.824
Roman, do you have any memories of Cade?

23:23.945 --> 23:26.450
Anything from Shepherd's compound?

23:27.769 --> 23:29.021
I don't think so.

23:29.056 --> 23:31.390
Talking about Phase Two?

23:34.684 --> 23:36.092
I'm sorry.

23:36.127 --> 23:39.095
I'm... I'm trying, I just...

23:39.343 --> 23:41.856
I can't, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.417
It's okay. It was a long shot.

23:45.493 --> 23:46.823
Well, your brother in a cage.

23:46.875 --> 23:48.875
Guess you got your way after all.

23:53.686 --> 23:56.521
Okay, I'll get some more
ammo from the armory.

23:58.525 --> 23:59.659
Need a hand?

24:02.390 --> 24:04.713
You're a grown man, you're
gonna let your sister

24:04.748 --> 24:06.648
tell you who you can be friends with?

24:07.564 --> 24:08.516
Hey...

24:10.738 --> 24:12.413
We are not friends.

24:13.496 --> 24:14.676
Roman...

24:17.743 --> 24:19.884
Can't keep him locked up forever.

24:19.919 --> 24:22.843
Good boy, Roman. Good boy.

24:24.992 --> 24:26.756
People like Cade are beneath you.

24:26.868 --> 24:28.238
I thought Shepherd didn't believe in rank.

24:28.273 --> 24:30.606
That's not what...

24:30.684 --> 24:32.058
We need to stay together.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.991
Shepherd, you, and me.

24:34.026 --> 24:36.227
There's no room for anyone else.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.807
Understand?

24:57.211 --> 24:58.971
I just got my test results back.

24:59.006 --> 25:01.006
- You?
- Negative.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.281
Must've passed through my system.

25:02.316 --> 25:03.756
Guess I dodged a bullet.

25:06.048 --> 25:07.875
- What?
- A bullet?

25:07.938 --> 25:09.637
This was a cannonball.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.339
And no matter what that test says,

25:11.374 --> 25:13.527
you still have to deal with this problem.

25:13.613 --> 25:14.779
It was a couple-day bender.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.679
- I'm over it.
- You might be over the drugs.

25:17.774 --> 25:20.508
You are not over the reason you used them.

25:21.990 --> 25:25.206
Jones is dead, Freddy's
gone. I can flush the coke.

25:25.241 --> 25:26.369
- Reade...
- I appreciate everything

25:26.404 --> 25:27.296
you've done for me.

25:27.338 --> 25:30.706
I really do, you know that.
This was a wake-up call.

25:30.741 --> 25:31.925
- I'll be okay.
- Talk to Weller.

25:32.003 --> 25:33.863
Take some time off. Get some help.

25:33.910 --> 25:35.755
I don't need help, Tasha.

25:35.841 --> 25:38.634
I mean this in the most
loving way possible,

25:38.712 --> 25:40.570
either you tell Weller
you need some time off,

25:40.625 --> 25:42.877
or I will do it for you.

25:42.912 --> 25:44.147
No, you won't.

25:45.523 --> 25:47.026
You're my best friend.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.944
That is exactly why I will do it.

26:04.815 --> 26:06.779
Prison transport's on the way.

26:08.630 --> 26:11.365
You know, I wanna catch
Shepherd just as much as you do.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.659
So what now?

26:13.754 --> 26:16.868
You're facing charges for treason

26:16.903 --> 26:18.229
and terrorism

26:18.428 --> 26:19.922
for your role in Sandstorm.

26:19.999 --> 26:22.566
I mean with Shepherd. Do
you have any other leads?

26:30.889 --> 26:32.455
I'm sorry about your dad.

26:34.413 --> 26:36.186
My uncle was a miner.

26:36.255 --> 26:38.533
He was on the job for 32 years.

26:38.635 --> 26:39.596
I know.

26:40.496 --> 26:42.597
Shepherd talked about you a lot.

26:43.171 --> 26:44.728
What else did she tell you?

26:44.781 --> 26:46.867
- My role in her plans?
- No.

26:46.945 --> 26:49.547
Like I said, those details
were strictly need-to-know.

26:49.625 --> 26:53.180
You told Nas to follow
the cogs... is that me?

26:53.239 --> 26:55.007
It's just something I
heard Shepherd say once.

26:55.077 --> 26:57.698
- Didn't hear the context.
- It doesn't make sense.

26:57.758 --> 26:59.597
Why does Shepherd care about me so much?

26:59.632 --> 27:01.494
Shepherd doesn't care about you.

27:02.213 --> 27:04.327
Or anyone. Look at her own children.

27:04.361 --> 27:06.213
She loved them, and she tried to kill them.

27:06.305 --> 27:09.489
She's protecting you
because you're still useful.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.213
The second you're not...

27:12.307 --> 27:14.040
things tend to get real simple.

27:28.007 --> 27:29.423
Oh, my God.

27:37.254 --> 27:40.066
Think of the asset she can
be, the intel she can provide.

27:42.387 --> 27:44.912
I... I have this piercing headache,

27:44.965 --> 27:47.089
and I can't seem to think straight.

27:47.966 --> 27:49.935
Shepherd's always one step ahead of us.

27:49.970 --> 27:51.420
So when are we gonna get a break?

27:55.003 --> 27:57.249
Not now... not now!

28:02.850 --> 28:04.774
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.467
Uh, this is kind of a weird question,

28:06.529 --> 28:08.908
but are you my supervisor?

28:08.962 --> 28:11.961
Yeah. I guess I am, why?

28:12.068 --> 28:14.353
Well, this requisition form,

28:14.406 --> 28:17.210
uh, it asks for my supervisor's signature.

28:17.292 --> 28:18.945
It's for Roman.

28:19.009 --> 28:20.344
Mattress, pillows,

28:20.410 --> 28:22.763
blankets, books, reading lamp.

28:22.798 --> 28:24.452
Yeah, look, I just...

28:24.511 --> 28:27.879
I can't stand the idea
that he's so unsettled.

28:29.536 --> 28:31.837
I know that feeling.

28:31.907 --> 28:34.326
It's the same one that I
had when you first got here.

28:38.749 --> 28:40.082
- What's up?
- Hey.

28:40.832 --> 28:41.987
_

28:43.229 --> 28:46.068
I've been running a
diagnostic on my server.

28:46.177 --> 28:47.914
- _
- Long story short,

28:47.949 --> 28:51.882
I have a root corruption
issue in my I.O. subsystem.

28:52.618 --> 28:54.118
_

28:54.855 --> 28:58.827
The problem goes all the way down
to the drivers and controllers.

29:00.210 --> 29:01.569
_

29:03.853 --> 29:05.196
_

29:05.262 --> 29:07.664
Uh... we have to deal with it

29:08.183 --> 29:11.011
before it corrupts the entire FBI server.

29:11.415 --> 29:12.872
_

29:14.310 --> 29:16.296
I think I can fix it, I just... I just...

29:16.331 --> 29:18.061
I need a few hours.

29:20.195 --> 29:21.758
_

29:24.469 --> 29:26.889
Okay, get to work.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.166
- What is this room?
- It's for sensitive computer forensics.

29:40.282 --> 29:42.290
The metal mesh blocks
communication signals,

29:42.325 --> 29:43.729
so Sandstorm can't hear us.

29:43.786 --> 29:45.829
What do you mean,
"Sandstorm can't hear us"?

29:45.864 --> 29:47.754
The migraines I've been having,

29:47.834 --> 29:49.513
the time that I passed out,

29:49.615 --> 29:52.685
I thought they were all
after-effects from the torture.

29:52.720 --> 29:57.184
This... is an x-ray of my mouth.

29:57.263 --> 30:00.619
And this... this is a radio transmitter.

30:00.654 --> 30:02.389
It's inside your tooth?

30:02.444 --> 30:05.275
When Shepherd tortured me, she
clocked me pretty hard in the jaw.

30:06.924 --> 30:09.932
I think she planted a bug
while I was unconscious.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.798
I thought that you were scanning
for listening devices every day.

30:12.869 --> 30:15.618
This is emitting at such a low frequency

30:15.678 --> 30:18.250
and using local radio towers as repeaters.

30:18.285 --> 30:20.409
It's ingenious and basically invisible.

30:20.468 --> 30:22.606
How did the doctors not catch this?

30:22.692 --> 30:24.963
Because they were looking to
see if my jaw was fractured.

30:24.998 --> 30:27.397
This looks like a cavity
unless you crazy zoom in.

30:27.461 --> 30:29.421
She wanted you to escape that cabin.

30:29.523 --> 30:32.112
That's how Sandstorm's
one step ahead of us.

30:32.190 --> 30:34.055
They hear the play
calls before we run them.

30:34.118 --> 30:35.369
You should get to the infirmary.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.342
Get that bug out as soon as possible.

30:38.302 --> 30:40.170
Actually...

30:40.588 --> 30:42.794
I was thinking we don't
quite take it out just yet.

30:44.547 --> 30:47.182
Sandstorm doesn't know
that we've found that bug.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.068
So, we can use that to
feed them misinformation.

30:50.133 --> 30:51.466
What are you thinking?

30:54.820 --> 30:56.157
You need to hear this.

30:59.745 --> 31:01.651
<i>I just got back from Roman's cell.</i>

31:01.725 --> 31:03.225
<i>Good idea putting Cade with him.</i>

31:03.292 --> 31:04.364
<i>It's going well?</i>

31:04.413 --> 31:06.616
Yeah, it's helping Roman recover memories.

31:06.694 --> 31:09.188
Nothing concrete yet, just bits and pieces.

31:09.247 --> 31:11.087
Anything about Phase Two?

31:11.122 --> 31:13.380
<i>He's said the phrase
a couple of times.</i>

31:13.443 --> 31:16.972
The details will come.
Let's let Roman rest.

31:17.007 --> 31:18.653
Reade, Patterson,

31:18.700 --> 31:20.631
get the Millerton safehouse ready for Cade.

31:20.690 --> 31:22.768
- On it.
- You got it.

31:22.844 --> 31:25.197
We'll regroup tomorrow. Good night.

31:25.408 --> 31:28.373
We need to take out Cade before
Roman recovers more memories.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.870
Should we alert Shepherd?

31:29.956 --> 31:31.677
She's on a barge in
the middle of the ocean.

31:31.732 --> 31:33.378
We have to handle this ourselves.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.995
I'll put a team together.

31:49.179 --> 31:51.407
Is an ankle bracelet really necessary?

31:51.451 --> 31:53.284
Well, Weller says we have to work with you.

31:53.337 --> 31:55.839
<i>That doesn't mean we
have to trust you.</i>

31:55.901 --> 31:58.274
<i>All right, Lenkin and Glaser
are about 20 minutes out.</i>

31:58.348 --> 32:00.782
<i>I don't understand how these
guys are always so damn late.</i>

32:03.426 --> 32:07.478
Everyone sit tight, we'll strike
after the FBI does their shift change.

32:16.011 --> 32:18.413
<i>Hold on, there's something
wrong with the battery.</i>

32:20.442 --> 32:21.375
Gun!

32:24.443 --> 32:26.658
<i>Officers down! We need backup!</i>

32:28.193 --> 32:30.334
Cade's on the move. Go, go!

32:39.215 --> 32:40.463
Let's go, let's go!

32:43.762 --> 32:46.163
Stay in pursuit! Do not let him get away!

32:57.421 --> 32:59.645
Fall back! It's a trap, fall back!

33:00.249 --> 33:01.644
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:03.311 --> 33:04.912
This is the FBI!

33:05.324 --> 33:06.727
You're surrounded!

33:07.627 --> 33:11.029
Drop your weapons! Put your hands up!

33:11.111 --> 33:12.644
Keep them where we can see them!

33:15.848 --> 33:17.010
Freeze!

33:18.641 --> 33:20.250
Hands where I can see them!

33:20.368 --> 33:21.353
Now!

33:30.807 --> 33:32.267
You're completely surrounded!

33:32.353 --> 33:34.009
You've got no options!

33:34.090 --> 33:35.885
So drop your weapons!

33:37.665 --> 33:38.971
Weller, I got a clean shot.

33:39.034 --> 33:40.931
Do not take that shot, Reade.

33:40.966 --> 33:42.324
Everyone, hold your fire.

33:42.390 --> 33:43.689
We need them alive!

33:52.126 --> 33:53.710
What the hell just happened?

34:00.651 --> 34:03.872
I've got Borden, entering the barn
on the south end of the property.

34:03.907 --> 34:04.792
<i>Don't engage.</i>

34:04.830 --> 34:06.130
<i>Wait for backup!</i>

34:17.379 --> 34:19.444
There's no way out, Nigel.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.179
Turn yourself in.

34:21.214 --> 34:23.215
You know I'm not gonna do that.

34:23.250 --> 34:24.532
Are you sure about that?

34:24.587 --> 34:28.319
'Cause we've got a nice, eight by
ten supermax cell ready for you.

34:38.029 --> 34:39.880
Do you see those propane tanks?!

34:40.078 --> 34:42.293
What do you think "highly flammable" means?

34:43.512 --> 34:44.646
Gah!

34:54.127 --> 34:57.516
Nigel Thornton, you're under arrest.

34:57.639 --> 34:59.867
Let go of the gun

34:59.953 --> 35:01.752
and put your hands in the air.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.764
No.

35:03.850 --> 35:05.749
No, you'll have to kill me.

35:05.826 --> 35:07.244
No...

35:07.312 --> 35:10.520
You're gonna spend the rest of your life

35:10.597 --> 35:13.077
rotting in a cell, living
with what you've done.

35:13.112 --> 35:15.646
It's okay... It's okay.

35:15.874 --> 35:17.832
Any reasonable person
would want to kill me.

35:17.867 --> 35:19.305
- Shut up!
- Your rage is completely normal...

35:19.368 --> 35:23.003
Shut up! You don't get
to do that to me anymore!

35:24.056 --> 35:25.682
I'm not gonna kill you.

35:25.745 --> 35:27.345
I took an oath...

35:27.910 --> 35:29.881
to my country,

35:30.046 --> 35:32.900
to the Bureau, to uphold the law.

35:32.978 --> 35:34.972
I really did care about you, you know.

35:37.516 --> 35:39.028
And I didn't mean...

35:39.077 --> 35:40.810
Yes, you did!

35:41.294 --> 35:43.278
You lied to me.

35:43.412 --> 35:45.322
You betrayed me.

35:47.250 --> 35:51.066
You... you destroyed me.

35:51.136 --> 35:52.636
You have to know.

35:53.112 --> 35:56.107
I am sorry I did this to you.

35:56.188 --> 36:00.345
No, you don't get to apologize,

36:00.496 --> 36:03.962
and you don't get out
of this on your terms.

36:05.256 --> 36:08.181
Now put down the gun.

36:16.060 --> 36:18.416
I didn't want to do this.

36:27.732 --> 36:28.833
Uhh!

37:10.994 --> 37:12.213
Patterson?

37:12.291 --> 37:15.251
Yeah. Uh, I'm sorry, I'm listening.

37:15.286 --> 37:16.423
Can they still...

37:16.504 --> 37:20.566
No, uh, RF scrambler. They can't hear us.

37:21.142 --> 37:23.896
Look, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

37:23.931 --> 37:25.478
I know what you're going through.

37:25.513 --> 37:27.087
When I killed Oscar,

37:27.173 --> 37:29.369
I thought I'd feel some...

37:29.475 --> 37:31.475
overwhelming sense of relief.

37:31.545 --> 37:34.375
But I just felt betrayed and angry

37:34.410 --> 37:37.045
and... somehow more unsafe.

37:37.126 --> 37:38.725
If that makes any sense.

37:40.919 --> 37:44.385
Actually... I'm fine.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.588
Are you sure? Because what just happened

37:46.623 --> 37:49.844
was pretty traumatic and... not just today,

37:49.925 --> 37:51.892
but... all of it.

37:53.111 --> 37:55.178
Yeah, I... I don't...

37:57.345 --> 37:59.631
I feel... nothing.

38:01.416 --> 38:02.600
I feel nothing.

38:05.716 --> 38:06.679
Okay.

38:08.342 --> 38:10.165
If you ever want to talk...

38:12.564 --> 38:14.136
I'm gonna go up to the infirmary.

38:14.188 --> 38:16.889
Get this tooth pulled.

38:27.833 --> 38:29.375
I'll be honest, I didn't think you were

38:29.410 --> 38:30.917
gonna come through on your promise.

38:30.996 --> 38:33.860
I'll be honest, I wasn't sure
if I was going to, either.

38:33.951 --> 38:35.846
But you held up your end.

38:36.748 --> 38:39.291
So... where will you go?

38:39.345 --> 38:40.869
Anywhere but here.

38:41.356 --> 38:42.865
You don't have to.

38:42.924 --> 38:44.524
You could stay and fight.

38:44.599 --> 38:46.799
Shepherd is still out there
with an army behind her,

38:46.834 --> 38:49.612
determined to strike... we
need all the help we can get.

38:49.698 --> 38:52.583
Well, when you put it that
way, it sounds so appealing.

38:52.637 --> 38:54.500
You and I both want the same thing, Cade.

38:54.535 --> 38:56.469
To stop Shepherd from
destroying our country.

38:56.523 --> 38:58.990
The same country that tried
to cover up my father's death?

39:00.177 --> 39:04.219
What, you think I was
doing this for America?

39:04.929 --> 39:07.791
I only defected because Shepherd
became what she was fighting against.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.247
Well, then stay for revenge.

39:09.317 --> 39:11.155
For what she did to you,
what she did to Markos.

39:11.190 --> 39:12.467
You don't get it.

39:12.502 --> 39:14.429
Shepherd, her army, her plans,

39:14.499 --> 39:15.989
they can't be stopped.

39:16.067 --> 39:18.161
I thought you said you didn't
know any details of Phase Two.

39:18.212 --> 39:20.707
I don't. I know Shepherd.

39:20.742 --> 39:24.030
And when Phase Two begins,
I wanna be far, far away.

39:27.507 --> 39:28.640
Trust me.

39:28.987 --> 39:31.663
When it goes down, you will, too.

39:35.136 --> 39:36.956
He's not the man I thought he was.

39:36.991 --> 39:40.171
I guess that's why they say you
should never meet your heroes.

39:40.228 --> 39:41.752
Cade was all we have left.

39:41.830 --> 39:43.297
Now he's gone.

39:43.332 --> 39:46.361
Battling Shepherd is like trying
to grab a fistful of water.

39:46.437 --> 39:48.402
All right, Nas, look at it this way.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.175
Two of her key lieutenants
are on our side now.

39:51.261 --> 39:52.603
And the other one's dead, and it looks like

39:52.681 --> 39:54.319
she's preparing to flee the country.

39:54.386 --> 39:57.679
For the first time, we've
got her on the ropes.

39:57.780 --> 39:58.968
She's desperate.

39:59.026 --> 40:00.843
That's what I'm afraid of.

40:03.049 --> 40:04.915
First, I'm starting
with a local anesthetic.

40:04.993 --> 40:06.506
I don't need it, I'm allergic.

40:06.595 --> 40:08.094
- You don't know what's in it.
- What's in it?

40:08.162 --> 40:10.229
- Lidocaine and epinephrine.
- I'm allergic.

40:11.217 --> 40:13.160
This is an intensely painful procedure.

40:13.195 --> 40:15.269
We could find another anesthetic.

40:15.304 --> 40:17.438
Just get this thing out of me.

40:48.202 --> 40:50.093
Just wanted to say good night.

40:50.194 --> 40:51.684
You didn't have to do all this.

40:53.128 --> 40:54.678
Yeah, I did.

40:54.764 --> 40:55.720
Thank you.

40:57.786 --> 40:59.305
_

40:59.356 --> 41:01.601
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

41:01.724 --> 41:03.333
Yeah, it's just a work thing.

41:03.417 --> 41:05.189
You should probably get to it.

41:05.655 --> 41:06.955
Good night.

41:20.180 --> 41:23.416
I like you... a lot.

41:23.899 --> 41:26.980
And I think you kind of just
caught me off-guard last night.

41:27.015 --> 41:31.044
Maybe we should come up with a list
of off-limit topics and safe topics...

41:35.867 --> 41:36.900
Or this.

41:38.228 --> 41:39.967
This is good, too.

41:50.707 --> 41:52.311
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:53.166 --> 41:55.129
We need to talk about Reade.

41:55.206 --> 41:57.253
Okay. Come in.

42:03.706 --> 42:04.890
Ohh!

42:04.979 --> 42:05.912
Uhh!
