Jake: You know, he's only
hanging out with you

00:03.456 --> 00:05.125
'cause he thought your dad was
gonna be here tonight, right -

00:05.192 --> 00:06.326
<i>'cause of his demo.</i>

00:06.393 --> 00:08.128
You don't anything
about that.

00:08.195 --> 00:10.130
I don't want you
to get hurt.

00:10.347 --> 00:13.682
I can take care of myself,
thank you.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.584
I've made a decision.

00:15.652 --> 00:18.086
I want you and Peter
to have the Hanley farm.

00:18.154 --> 00:20.822
Is this what you want?

00:20.890 --> 00:21.591
(Sighs)

00:21.890 --> 00:22.591
Yes.

00:22.659 --> 00:24.526
It doesn't matter whether Miranda's
a good mother or not;

00:24.594 --> 00:28.129
Ninety percent of all cases
are awarded to the mother -

00:28.197 --> 00:29.963
as if a guy can't even be
a good caregiver.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.865
Well, your history
speaks to that.

00:31.933 --> 00:33.334
I thought you wanted
to marry me

00:33.402 --> 00:34.802
because you loved me,

00:34.869 --> 00:37.869
not because you were trying
to win some custody battle.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.827
I really need

01:52.509 --> 01:54.343
So just give me a call,
will you, please!

01:54.411 --> 01:55.578
Thank you!

01:55.645 --> 01:57.212
(Beeps phone off)
What?

01:57.280 --> 01:58.180
Jack: It's like you've
never helped pack before.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.382
I bring the boxes to you,

01:59.449 --> 02:00.516
you take them out
to the Quonset.

02:00.584 --> 02:02.150
Tim:
Oh, come on!

02:02.218 --> 02:03.151
(Box crashes on the floor)

02:03.219 --> 02:03.853
Guys!

02:03.920 --> 02:05.320
He dropped it.

02:05.388 --> 02:06.954
Tim: Come on!
Who packed it anyway?

02:07.022 --> 02:08.990
The bottom fell out of it.

02:09.056 --> 02:11.192
You gotta tape those things up
at the bottom-

02:11.260 --> 02:13.661
Jack: There was nothing
wrong with the box.

02:13.729 --> 02:15.563
Lou: It's Peter's
grandmother's China...

02:15.631 --> 02:16.964
I don't know
why you're moving

02:17.032 --> 02:19.066
into that old run down
house anyway.

02:19.134 --> 02:20.635
It's not that run down.

02:20.703 --> 02:22.469
Oh, it needs a roof,

02:22.537 --> 02:24.004
and the plumbing's shot.

02:24.071 --> 02:25.972
The wiring's from 1910.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.474
Jack: Don't listen to him, Lou.
(Tim's phone rings)

02:27.542 --> 02:29.910
We'll all pitch in and get
that place in order for you.

02:29.977 --> 02:33.013
Tim: Oh, here's my lawyer.
Here's my lawyer.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.549
Yeah?
What do you got for me?

02:35.617 --> 02:37.083
Yeah?

02:37.151 --> 02:38.651
Mallory: Jeez!
You shouldn't block an entranceway.

02:38.719 --> 02:40.386
What if there's a fire?

02:40.454 --> 02:41.854
Lou: Well, I'm glad
you're finally here,

02:41.922 --> 02:44.490
'cause we've been
a bit shorthanded.

02:44.558 --> 02:45.792
Mallory: I'm actually just
checking on some things

02:45.859 --> 02:48.027
that I ordered for
my sweet sixteen party...

02:48.094 --> 02:50.296
On my new toy that I can
now not live without -

02:50.363 --> 02:52.231
an early birthday present
from my parents.

02:52.299 --> 02:53.465
Ta-da!

02:53.533 --> 02:54.499
Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Back up!

02:54.567 --> 02:55.934
What party?

02:56.001 --> 02:57.836
You're not thinking
of having it here, I hope?

02:57.904 --> 02:59.805
But this is the perfect
spot.

02:59.872 --> 03:02.607
We can just clear this all out
and put a dance floor and-

03:02.675 --> 03:05.844
You are not turning my house
into some kind of disco!

03:05.912 --> 03:08.914
Jack, I'm kidding.
I'm renting out Maggie's.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.481
Lou: Really?
How big is this party gonna be?

03:10.549 --> 03:13.483
Big. Huge.
Ginormous, hopefully.

03:13.952 --> 03:16.219
DJ, little twinkly
lights everywhere,

03:16.287 --> 03:18.556
one of those amazing
cupcake trees.

03:18.623 --> 03:19.957
The sky's the limit.

03:20.024 --> 03:21.992
And your parents are gonna pay
for all that?

03:22.060 --> 03:23.293
Whatever I want!

03:23.361 --> 03:24.061
And they said not to worry
about the cost,

03:24.128 --> 03:26.796
so it's gonna be awesome!

03:26.864 --> 03:27.931
<i>I know you're probably</i>
<i>wondering</i>

03:27.998 --> 03:30.232
why you haven't seen
an invitation yet;

03:30.300 --> 03:31.968
That's because
you're not invited.

03:32.035 --> 03:33.470
No adults, period.

03:33.537 --> 03:34.471
<i>So don't take it personally</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

03:34.538 --> 03:36.840
(Phone rings)
It's Austin.

03:36.907 --> 03:38.708
He's picking me up
on his way to work.

03:38.776 --> 03:40.409
Lou: Oh, but you're-you're gonna
stay and help me pack though,

03:40.478 --> 03:41.677
right, Mallory?

03:41.744 --> 03:43.178
Mallor- Mallory!

03:43.245 --> 03:44.680
(Door bangs shut)

03:46.916 --> 03:49.651
Mmm...
Yummy, yummy de-worming paste.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.387
Good boy.

03:52.455 --> 03:54.122
- Oh!
- Oh! (Laughs)

03:54.190 --> 03:55.591
I'm sorry.

03:57.593 --> 03:59.059
Mmm. Apple.

03:59.127 --> 04:00.260
(Ty and Amy laugh)

04:00.328 --> 04:01.963
<i>April:</i>
<i>Hey, Scott,</i>

04:02.030 --> 04:03.464
long time no see.

04:05.701 --> 04:07.167
What're you doing here?

04:07.235 --> 04:09.504
Well, since you wouldn't
return my calls,

04:09.571 --> 04:11.506
or texts, or emails,

04:11.573 --> 04:12.540
I dropped by
your clinic.

04:12.608 --> 04:13.940
<i>They said you were here.</i>

04:14.008 --> 04:16.041
Well, I sent you
that list of vets.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.011
Yeah, thanks for that.

04:20.047 --> 04:22.448
Uh, I'm Ty Borden.
This is Amy.

04:22.517 --> 04:23.650
Amy:
Hey!

04:23.718 --> 04:25.151
April Goodstoney.

04:26.453 --> 04:27.888
So what part of the word
"emergency"

04:27.955 --> 04:29.955
<i>didn't you understand?</i>

04:30.023 --> 04:31.423
What's the emergency?

04:31.491 --> 04:33.726
We lost a few horses
to the EHV-1 virus

04:33.793 --> 04:35.995
on the Reserve
a couple of days ago.

04:36.062 --> 04:37.129
What's the source?

04:37.196 --> 04:38.931
A cutting show
down South.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.866
The owner isolated
his other horses

04:40.934 --> 04:42.467
but there may have been contact
with the Band horses

04:42.536 --> 04:44.637
<i>that run loose</i>
<i>on the Reserve.</i>

04:44.704 --> 04:46.771
Everyone's worried
it'll spread.

04:46.839 --> 04:48.339
So the council voted
to have them culled.

04:48.407 --> 04:50.008
<i>It's gonna happen</i>
<i>in three days.</i>

04:50.075 --> 04:52.410
What happens if the herd
isn't infected?

04:52.477 --> 04:54.245
Ty: Yeah, they
need to be tested.

04:54.312 --> 04:56.247
It's the only chance
to save them.

04:56.314 --> 04:57.683
(Sighs)

04:57.714 --> 04:58.683
Like I said,

04:58.751 --> 05:01.052
there's plenty of vets
around.

05:01.119 --> 05:02.118
Any one of them
could help.

05:02.186 --> 05:04.988
You don't need me
for this.

05:05.924 --> 05:09.125
That herd meant everything
to your grandfather.

05:09.193 --> 05:10.193
I thought if anyone
was gonna step up,

05:10.261 --> 05:11.394
it'd be you.

05:15.366 --> 05:17.267
You know,
it never occurred to me

05:17.334 --> 05:19.535
that you'd actually
say no to my face.

05:21.672 --> 05:24.006
Guess I was wrong
about you...

on a trip to Disney World

06:26.933 --> 06:27.933
when I was little -

06:28.001 --> 06:29.167
huge trip,
no reason at all.

06:29.235 --> 06:31.136
I even got the stupid
Mickey mouse ears.

06:31.203 --> 06:33.005
With your name stitched

06:33.072 --> 06:34.006
Yeah.

06:34.073 --> 06:35.206
It was great...

06:35.274 --> 06:38.342
Except my parents split up
the next week.

06:38.409 --> 06:39.576
I guess they wanted to give me
one more little treat

06:39.645 --> 06:41.512
before the axe fell.

06:42.447 --> 06:44.281
Thank you for sharing
your childhood trauma,

06:44.349 --> 06:46.717
but my party's not
like that.

06:46.785 --> 06:47.785
It's my sweet sixteen.

06:47.853 --> 06:48.986
It's supposed to be
a big deal.

06:49.054 --> 06:50.354
Whatever you say.

06:50.421 --> 06:51.588
My dad just got this
huge new record deal

06:51.657 --> 06:53.257
in Nashville, okay?

06:53.324 --> 06:54.223
That's why they have
the extra money

06:54.291 --> 06:55.324
to spend on me.

06:55.392 --> 06:56.660
Cool.

06:56.727 --> 06:58.361
You can definitely afford
to have a band then.

06:58.428 --> 07:00.096

you could get me

07:00.164 --> 07:01.297

Austin...

07:02.366 --> 07:04.333

<i>Ty:</i> <i>So, you know this
April</i> <i>from before?</i>

07:12.842 --> 07:13.742
Yeah. She's from
the same Reserve

07:13.810 --> 07:15.277
I grew up on.

07:15.344 --> 07:16.278
That's kind of intense.

07:16.345 --> 07:17.646
Yeah.
She's a lawyer,

07:17.714 --> 07:20.215
and she represents
the Band Council now.

07:20.283 --> 07:21.283
Sounds like she's having
a pretty hard time

07:21.350 --> 07:22.885
with them at the moment.

07:22.952 --> 07:25.154
This EHV-1 virus
sounds pretty serious.

07:25.221 --> 07:26.654
Well, it spreads
real easy,

07:26.722 --> 07:29.223
and causes respiratory
and neurological disease.

07:29.291 --> 07:30.658
It kills young foals.

07:30.726 --> 07:31.859
I can see why they're
so stressed out about it

07:31.927 --> 07:32.960
at the Reserve.

07:33.028 --> 07:34.062
Yeah.

07:37.132 --> 07:39.767
Scott,
you know that herd -

07:39.835 --> 07:42.602
sounds like you could
really help them out.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.603
I haven't been back
to the Reserve

07:43.671 --> 07:46.173
since my grandfather died.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.841
Not a whole lot of happy
memories there for me,

07:47.909 --> 07:49.176
you know?

07:50.611 --> 07:52.611
Yeah, no, I get it.

07:52.679 --> 07:53.879
Only we're talking about

07:53.947 --> 07:56.281
an entire herd of horses
getting killed off,

07:56.349 --> 07:59.518
and they may not even
have the virus.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.955
They're Band horses, Ty.

08:03.023 --> 08:06.158
Getting near them would be...
Almost impossible.

08:08.828 --> 08:10.895

Oh yeah, sure.

09:02.845 --> 09:05.013
I thought I've heard

09:05.081 --> 09:06.381
You try to get a girlfriend

to ride broncs;

09:07.650 --> 09:09.317

09:09.385 --> 09:11.219
No! It could be genius.

09:12.453 --> 09:13.954
No, it's pathetic.

09:14.923 --> 09:15.890
It's not like that, Tim.

09:15.957 --> 09:17.391
Yeah, right, buddy.

09:17.458 --> 09:18.458
<i>Getting a girl</i>
<i>in the saddle's one thing,</i>

09:18.526 --> 09:20.961
keeping her there
is another.

09:21.029 --> 09:22.997
(Laughs,
banging door shut)

09:23.064 --> 09:24.731
Mallory:
Jake! Wait!

09:26.001 --> 09:27.901
Uh, you could
look at me.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.068
Why didn't you reply
to my evite?

09:29.136 --> 09:31.838
My party's going
to be crazy.

09:31.906 --> 09:34.274
Whoa!
Pink and purple.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.676
What's wrong with pink
and purple?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.278
Nothing.
It looks great.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.946
I hope it all
goes well.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.114
You're not coming?

09:41.182 --> 09:44.049
Actually,
I'm kind of busy.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.151
It's my sweet sixteen.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.353
I know, I just have a lot
going on, okay?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.788
Like what?

09:51.991 --> 09:53.558
Okay, whatever.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.593
I just thought you might
want to come.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.730
I'll see what I can do.
I'll talk to you later.

10:04.669 --> 10:06.237
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Okay, so what's the plan?</i>

10:06.305 --> 10:08.339
Scott: Well, we gotta
find the herd first.

10:08.406 --> 10:10.041
Ty: And then we have to figure
out how to examine them

10:10.108 --> 10:12.109
and then hopefully
vaccinate them.

10:12.177 --> 10:13.845
Scott: Yeah, and if any of
them are carrying the virus,

10:13.912 --> 10:15.346
we'll have to destroy them.

10:15.413 --> 10:16.679
Amy:
The whole herd?

10:16.747 --> 10:18.114
Possibly.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.983
Don't be taking
any of our horses out there

10:20.051 --> 10:21.351
if there's a virus.

10:21.418 --> 10:22.719
April said she has
some vaccinated horses

10:22.786 --> 10:23.987
for us to ride.

10:24.055 --> 10:25.021
So you talked
to her then?

10:25.089 --> 10:26.089
Who's April?

10:27.691 --> 10:30.894
Someone I used to know,
back from the Reserve.

10:30.962 --> 10:32.427
<i>Amy:</i> <i>She came out to
see Scott</i> <i>today.</i>

10:32.495 --> 10:33.929
Well, about the horses.

10:33.997 --> 10:36.665
Right...
And that's the whole story?

10:36.733 --> 10:38.334
Yep.

10:38.401 --> 10:39.068
Lou: Come on.
You haven't been back on the Reserve,

10:39.135 --> 10:40.435
for, like, years.

10:40.503 --> 10:41.770
Isn't it kinda weird
that this April girl

10:41.838 --> 10:44.373
tracks you down
after all this time?

10:44.440 --> 10:46.475
She's just a friend
that needs a favour,

10:46.542 --> 10:47.876
<i>that's all.</i>

10:47.943 --> 10:49.677
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>thanks for dinner.</i>

10:49.745 --> 10:51.279
I should be going.

10:51.347 --> 10:54.615
<i>I'll pick you guys up</i>
<i>at 7 in morning?</i>

10:56.418 --> 10:58.452

11:13.902 --> 11:15.235
(Truck rumbles)

11:31.051 --> 11:32.084
Amy:
Wow.

11:32.152 --> 11:34.153
This is a beautiful spot.

11:35.088 --> 11:36.788
Who owns
this place?

11:36.855 --> 11:38.156
I do.

11:38.224 --> 11:39.357
Amy:
Really?

11:39.425 --> 11:40.691
Yeah,
it was my grandfather's.

11:40.759 --> 11:42.894
He left it to me
when he died.

11:42.962 --> 11:44.429
Wow. How come
you haven't been back?

11:44.496 --> 11:45.563
(Door opens)

11:50.002 --> 11:52.502
Thanks for changing
your mind.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.207

Hey, April!

12:18.929 --> 12:20.930
Winters are tough
on the old place.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.100
Ty:
We should uh...

12:25.168 --> 12:26.969
We'll grab
the rest of the gear.

12:27.036 --> 12:28.236
Be right back.

12:30.606 --> 12:33.108
Thank you
for opening up the house.

12:33.176 --> 12:35.577
I appreciate you
taking care of the place.

12:35.644 --> 12:37.579
I don't do it for you.

12:37.646 --> 12:40.081
I do it
for your grandfather.

12:42.150 --> 12:44.485
Look,
I know this is awkward

12:46.288 --> 12:47.421
and I don't blame you

12:47.489 --> 12:49.323
for having this thing
against me.

12:49.391 --> 12:50.424
What thing?

12:52.227 --> 12:53.861
Oh, you mean,
the turning your back

12:53.928 --> 12:55.929
on your home Reserve;

12:55.997 --> 12:57.330
Avoiding responsibility

12:57.398 --> 12:59.532
to give back to the place
that raised you;

12:59.600 --> 13:00.766
Letting your grandfather's
gift to you

13:00.834 --> 13:03.636
<i>fall into ruin -</i>
<i>that thing?</i>

13:03.704 --> 13:06.672
Yeah. I guess I do have
a problem with that.

13:11.945 --> 13:13.312
By the way,
you should know

13:13.380 --> 13:15.947
the rancher who lost some
cutting horses to the virus

13:16.016 --> 13:17.649
is Don First Rider.

13:18.818 --> 13:20.452
Your husband.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.620

Well, let's go after her!

from casino to casino -

14:34.222 --> 14:37.224

14:38.460 --> 14:40.927
Well no!
Put him on the stand then!

14:42.664 --> 14:44.665
Sure. You ask Shane

14:48.136 --> 14:50.036

What, are you still
ticked at me

14:59.580 --> 15:02.983

<i>Come on, I was just giving</i>
<i>you the gears!</i>

15:04.684 --> 15:06.551
Come on, come on!
Come talk to me.

15:10.323 --> 15:11.790
Scott:
When I was a kid

15:11.858 --> 15:14.760
this herd would drift
into the valley around midday,

15:14.828 --> 15:16.629
and at night
they'd go to higher ground.

15:16.696 --> 15:18.163
April:
Still do.

15:18.231 --> 15:19.397
Amy:
Pretty well established herd

15:19.465 --> 15:20.999
if they've been around
that long.

15:21.066 --> 15:23.635
April: They've been around
for as long as I remember.

15:23.702 --> 15:25.970
Scott's grandfather
used to kinda...

15:26.038 --> 15:27.471
Look out for them.

15:27.539 --> 15:28.940
Scott: Yeah, when
winters were tough

15:29.008 --> 15:31.042
he'd haul hay out to them.

15:31.110 --> 15:33.577
And if a mare
was having trouble foaling,

15:33.646 --> 15:35.613
she'd show up
in his yard.

15:35.681 --> 15:37.347
April: He just kinda
had an understanding

15:37.414 --> 15:38.649
with these horses.

15:39.617 --> 15:42.252
He connected with them,
you know?

15:42.319 --> 15:44.621
Ty:
Sometimes that happens.

15:50.394 --> 15:53.595
Tim: So, Janice won't
answer the phone,

15:53.664 --> 15:55.397
so I figured I'd better
come out and get my stuff

15:55.465 --> 15:58.834
before she throws it out
or burns it.

15:58.902 --> 16:00.970
And she left us
a few cold ones.

16:02.706 --> 16:03.539
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>So you guys are done, huh?</i>

16:03.606 --> 16:05.708
Yeah, looks like it.

16:05.776 --> 16:08.877
It's probably
for the best.

16:08.944 --> 16:09.878
Oh...

16:13.149 --> 16:14.615
Mmm...

16:14.684 --> 16:16.250
Nothing like a cold one
on a hot day.

16:16.318 --> 16:17.485
I thought...

16:17.553 --> 16:18.386
I thought you weren't
supposed to-

16:18.453 --> 16:20.121
supposed to what?

16:20.189 --> 16:21.122
Well, didn't you
used to like...

16:21.190 --> 16:23.658
Used to like what?

16:23.726 --> 16:25.292
Well, you had issues with-

16:25.359 --> 16:26.459
What? What?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.728
What the hell
do you know about it?

16:27.796 --> 16:29.063
Nothing.
Let's just forget it.

16:29.130 --> 16:30.297
Oh no, no, no.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.965
You were gonna say something,
spit it out.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.034
You know, I should
probably get going.

16:34.102 --> 16:36.036
You were gonna say
something, so say it.

16:36.104 --> 16:37.437
What's your problem?

16:37.505 --> 16:38.939
My problem is there's
a kid standing in front of me,

16:39.040 --> 16:42.942
drinking my beer,
telling me I got a problem.

16:43.010 --> 16:44.276
You're drunk.

16:44.344 --> 16:45.644
I'm drunk?

16:45.713 --> 16:48.981
I've been sober longer
than you've been alive.

16:50.684 --> 16:52.185
Caleb:
Why don't uh...

16:52.252 --> 16:53.285
Why don't you just let me
give you a ride home?

16:53.353 --> 16:54.754
Why don't you
get out of my face?

16:54.822 --> 16:55.788
I'm just trying to be
a friend to you.

16:55.856 --> 16:56.955
You're being
a friend?

16:57.023 --> 16:58.690
You're just a stupid kid.

16:58.758 --> 17:00.192
You're a wannabe
rodeo star

17:00.259 --> 17:02.127
who couldn't keep
his marriage together.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.261
Ungh! Oh...

17:04.696 --> 17:06.263
'Cause you'd know.

17:09.468 --> 17:10.836
Tim:
Oh, sure,

17:11.568 --> 17:12.736
run away.

17:14.606 --> 17:17.174
You can dish it out,
but you can't take it.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.661
<i>(Eagle cries overhead)</i>

17:32.437 --> 17:34.171

There they are.

17:36.239 --> 17:37.173

17:40.177 --> 17:41.845
Wow,
they're so beautiful.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.147
(Horse whinnies)

17:46.083 --> 17:48.884
Yeah, you can see why my
grandpa looked out for them.

17:51.021 --> 17:53.288
Ty:
We gonna go after them?

17:57.627 --> 17:58.660
Not today.

17:59.729 --> 18:02.097
We need to build
a trap.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.199
Amy: You wanna lure
them down the hill?

18:04.266 --> 18:05.634
Scott:
Yeah, it's a good spot.

18:05.702 --> 18:07.435
We just need
to make a wing

18:07.503 --> 18:10.805
that'll bend into
a makeshift pen.

18:10.873 --> 18:13.140
April: There's some panels
in your grandfather's shed.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.775
Scott:
Yeah, that's a good start.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.612
<i>Don First Rider:</i>
<i>Well well, look who's back.</i>

18:19.648 --> 18:20.948
Scott:
Hey, Don.

18:22.183 --> 18:24.818
Thought you would've rode in
on a white horse.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.386
You follow us
out here?

18:26.453 --> 18:28.588
Don: Just keeping
an eye on the herd,

18:28.656 --> 18:31.491
making sure they keep away
from my horses.

18:31.559 --> 18:33.760
In a couple of days,
it won't matter any more.

18:33.828 --> 18:36.162
April: We're going to vaccinate
them; That's why Scott is here.

18:36.230 --> 18:37.564
I'm sure it is.

18:38.165 --> 18:39.798
<i>It's a waste of time.</i>

18:39.866 --> 18:41.767
If you lived here,
you'd know that.

18:41.835 --> 18:44.269
Look, I know you lost
some horses to the virus,

18:44.337 --> 18:46.605
but this EHV-1
is controllable.

18:46.673 --> 18:47.873
There's no need to think

18:47.941 --> 18:49.174
that any of those horses
are carrying it.

18:49.242 --> 18:50.709
Don:
I lost three -

18:50.777 --> 18:53.345
championship cutting horses,
all of them.

18:53.413 --> 18:55.113
This herd was in
the same field.

18:55.181 --> 18:56.714
I saw them.

18:56.782 --> 18:58.750
<i>They're putting everyone's</i>
<i>livestock at risk.</i>

18:58.817 --> 19:00.552
This could wipe me out;

19:00.619 --> 19:03.588
It took me years
to build up my business.

19:03.656 --> 19:04.756
<i>Anyway, you'll never</i>
<i>get close enough</i>

19:04.823 --> 19:06.958
to get a needle
into them.

19:07.026 --> 19:09.527
That's our problem
to solve, Don.

19:09.595 --> 19:12.462
So why don't you just let us
do our work here.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.909
Mallory: Fifteen, two,
four, and a pair is six.

19:25.977 --> 19:27.877
How's the party planning
coming along?

19:27.945 --> 19:29.579
All right, I guess.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.314
Tougher than you thought
it was going to be, huh?

19:32.382 --> 19:33.716
Jake's not coming.

19:33.784 --> 19:35.051
- Why not?
- I don't know.

19:35.118 --> 19:37.419
I guess he's still
a little awkward.

19:37.487 --> 19:39.855
But we're supposed
to be friends, you know?

19:39.923 --> 19:42.658
And if you were in
his shoes?

19:42.726 --> 19:44.659
I think I'd show up.

19:44.727 --> 19:46.728
I still care about him
as a friend.

19:46.796 --> 19:48.930
Even if he was the one
with the new girlfriend,

19:48.998 --> 19:51.132
and she was gonna be
on some stage

19:51.200 --> 19:54.636
singing corny love songs
all night?

19:56.639 --> 19:58.073
(Straining grunt)

20:00.075 --> 20:01.308
So once we've built
the trap,

20:01.375 --> 20:03.110
we'll drive the herd
down the valley into the gully?

20:03.177 --> 20:04.745
That's the plan.

20:04.813 --> 20:06.046
Amy: I don't know if driving
them's the best idea;

20:06.114 --> 20:07.648
They're so skittish.

20:07.716 --> 20:08.916
April:
Yes, yes,

20:08.984 --> 20:11.819
I understand everyone's
concerns...

20:11.886 --> 20:15.722
Bring the rest of those panels
out of the shed.

20:15.789 --> 20:17.123
April: Here, I'll let
you talk to the vet.

20:17.190 --> 20:18.457
Hold on.

20:18.525 --> 20:20.994
(Whispering)
Elder from the Band Council.

20:21.061 --> 20:23.262
Scott:
Scott Cardinal here.

20:24.197 --> 20:27.199
Yes. We understand
there's a plan in place.

20:29.469 --> 20:30.770
Mm-hmm.

20:30.838 --> 20:33.171
Yeah, we wanted to test
the horses before-

20:33.239 --> 20:35.273
(clears throat)
Yeah.

20:35.341 --> 20:37.509
It was nice
talking to you too.

20:37.576 --> 20:39.077
(Phone beeps off)

20:39.145 --> 20:40.445
Sorry.

20:40.513 --> 20:42.580
Scott:
Yeah, no pressure at all.

20:42.649 --> 20:44.382
Everyone's worried
about their stock.

20:44.450 --> 20:46.351
We have to move
quick.

20:46.418 --> 20:48.653
Is this trap idea
gonna work?

20:49.921 --> 20:51.722
I think so.
It should.

20:57.295 --> 20:58.896
Um, are you okay?

20:58.964 --> 21:01.532
I mean, with the Band Council
breathing down your neck

21:01.599 --> 21:03.533
and Don.

21:04.869 --> 21:07.336
What do you care
about me and Don?

21:07.404 --> 21:10.473
You haven't even asked
what happened to us.

21:10.541 --> 21:12.608
It's none of my business.

21:13.610 --> 21:15.779
We split a few years back.

21:17.014 --> 21:19.348
We had a lot
of issues.

21:19.416 --> 21:23.052
It's funny, he always had
this thing about you.

21:23.119 --> 21:24.019
I don't think
he ever believed

21:24.087 --> 21:25.854
that I was over you.

21:27.023 --> 21:29.324
<i>It wasn't true,</i>
<i>of course,</i>

21:29.392 --> 21:31.694
but I'm sure it caused
some resentment.

21:36.298 --> 21:38.700
I'm sorry
to hear that.

21:39.735 --> 21:42.336
I'm sorry that Don's being
such a jerk about this herd.

21:43.438 --> 21:44.371
<i>April:</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

21:44.439 --> 21:45.639
I mean,
everything he has

21:45.708 --> 21:47.842
is in that
cutting horse business.

21:47.910 --> 21:49.376
And I'm sure
it doesn't help

21:49.444 --> 21:51.913
that you and I are the ones
trying to protect them.

21:54.249 --> 21:57.484
Well, I...
I better get some dinner on.

21:57.552 --> 21:59.353
Yeah,
I should get going.

21:59.421 --> 22:01.054
You-you wanna stay?

22:02.390 --> 22:04.057
No. Thank you.

22:05.327 --> 22:08.195
I'll see you
in the morning.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.464
(Door opens and closes)

22:27.447 --> 22:30.181
<i>Ty:</i> <i>It must be kind
of weird</i> <i>for you,</i>

22:30.250 --> 22:31.617
coming back here,

22:31.684 --> 22:33.752
all the memories
in this place.

22:33.819 --> 22:34.953
Everywhere I turn,

22:35.020 --> 22:37.289
something reminds me
of my grandfather.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.790
Things weren't that good
with my parents,

22:38.858 --> 22:41.392
so he raised me
in this house.

22:42.461 --> 22:43.927
Then you ended up
at Heartland, right?

22:43.995 --> 22:45.396
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Yeah,</i>

22:45.464 --> 22:47.164
I got into a little trouble.

22:47.232 --> 22:48.532
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Trouble?!</i>

22:48.600 --> 22:50.434
What kind of trouble
would you get into?

22:50.502 --> 22:52.737
Usual things -
drinking and drugs.

22:53.672 --> 22:56.939
<i>Nearly killed myself</i>
<i>with that stuff.</i>

22:57.007 --> 22:59.108
Couple of my buddies did.

23:00.444 --> 23:02.812
But I lucked out though.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.315
Amy's mom got on my case,

23:05.383 --> 23:07.350
and she brought me
to Heartland.

23:07.418 --> 23:09.619
Well, we sure got that
in common.

23:10.588 --> 23:13.589
So never wanted
to come back here, huh?

23:13.657 --> 23:15.891
I used to want to,
when my grandfather was alive,

23:15.958 --> 23:18.327
but things were complicated.

23:20.730 --> 23:23.131
After he died,
wasn't much point.

23:24.100 --> 23:27.102
So there's no one else
you'd wanna see?

23:28.104 --> 23:29.570
(Chuckles)

23:29.638 --> 23:31.439
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>I'm just asking, man.</i>

23:31.507 --> 23:32.273
I mean, it sure seems
like something went on

23:32.341 --> 23:34.175
with you and April.

23:34.242 --> 23:36.243
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>(Shivering) Oh, man!</i>

23:36.312 --> 23:38.613
<i>It is getting cold</i>
<i>out there.</i>

23:40.515 --> 23:41.782
That's a nice bronze.

23:42.217 --> 23:43.551
Where's that from?

23:43.619 --> 23:45.786
Cutting horse competition;

23:45.853 --> 23:48.254
I was there for this one.

23:48.323 --> 23:50.324
Actually, so was April.

23:52.159 --> 23:53.960
When was that?

23:54.028 --> 23:55.595
A looong time ago.

23:57.432 --> 23:58.965
We were just kids.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.067
(Horses thunder along)

24:02.135 --> 24:03.168
April:
Hah!

24:06.839 --> 24:08.707
Yah! Yah!

24:08.774 --> 24:09.708
Scott:
Pull out!

24:09.775 --> 24:11.075
(Horses whinny)

24:21.754 --> 24:23.854
(Horses whinny
as they gallop along)

24:28.460 --> 24:29.860
April:
Yah!

24:29.927 --> 24:31.795
Scott:
Watch the mare!

24:35.834 --> 24:37.501
(Horses gallop along,
whinnying)

24:39.403 --> 24:40.436
Scott:
Yah!

24:44.341 --> 24:46.175
<i>Come up on the right side,</i>
<i>Ty!</i>

24:46.243 --> 24:47.276
Ty:
Okay!

24:49.480 --> 24:50.847
(Whinny)

24:51.314 --> 24:54.049
Scott: Amy, push
them up the middle.

24:56.185 --> 24:57.586
Ty:
Hyah! Come on!

24:57.653 --> 24:58.687
Amy:
Hyah!

24:59.655 --> 25:01.656
(Horses whinny)

25:01.724 --> 25:03.392
Scott:
Yah! Yah! Get down there!

25:07.196 --> 25:09.564
(Rocks crumble,
dirt sprays)

25:13.568 --> 25:14.635
Scott:
Yah!

25:16.838 --> 25:18.305
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Scott! Scott!</i>

25:18.373 --> 25:20.173
<i>You gotta get the lead mare!</i>
<i>She's calling him back.</i>

25:20.241 --> 25:21.375
Ty, get the gate!

25:21.443 --> 25:23.143
Scott:
Don't let them out!

25:24.145 --> 25:25.012
Turn them back!

25:25.079 --> 25:26.646
Ty:
Can't stop them!

25:26.714 --> 25:27.747
Amy:
Yah!

25:30.284 --> 25:31.718
Get around!
Get around!

25:31.786 --> 25:32.819
Scott:
Yah!

25:36.757 --> 25:38.090
<i>Go after them!</i>

25:38.158 --> 25:38.892
Ty:
I got it!

25:38.959 --> 25:40.259
Scott:
Yah!

25:40.327 --> 25:41.428
Ty:
I got it!

25:41.495 --> 25:42.594
Amy:
Argh!

25:42.662 --> 25:44.563
Get the gate, Ty!
Ty: Okay! Okay!

25:44.631 --> 25:47.699
(Horses whinny
as they take off)

25:47.767 --> 25:48.767
Scott:
Yah!

25:51.270 --> 25:52.337
(Foal cries)

26:19.296 --> 26:21.230
Don: Okay, so I see
you've had your chance.

26:21.298 --> 26:23.567
I think it'd be best
if you just go home now.

26:23.634 --> 26:25.936
That herd has become
a threat to us here.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.537
You don't get it,

26:28.473 --> 26:31.340
but your grandfather
would have.

26:35.378 --> 26:38.347
(Horses whinny
in the distance)

26:38.414 --> 26:39.615
(Foal whinnies)

26:44.488 --> 26:45.654
I don't believe it.

26:45.722 --> 26:47.054
We missed our shot.

26:47.122 --> 26:48.823
It's okay,
we got the foal.

26:48.891 --> 26:50.024
They'll come back
for him.

26:50.092 --> 26:51.793
We'll get him back
to the house,

26:51.861 --> 26:53.695
and do the inoculations
in the pen there.

26:53.762 --> 26:54.929
They seemed pretty spooked;

26:54.997 --> 26:55.897
I don't think
they're gonna come back.

26:55.965 --> 26:58.332
<i>(Horse whinnies nearby)</i>

26:58.400 --> 26:59.433
Look.

26:59.502 --> 27:00.802
(Mare whinnies)

27:05.907 --> 27:07.741
It's her,

27:07.809 --> 27:09.810
<i>back for her foal.</i>

27:22.878 --> 27:24.745
<i>Amy:</i> <i>I saw the look</i>
<i>in that mare's eyes.</i>

27:24.812 --> 27:26.880
We can use the foal
to bring her in,

27:26.948 --> 27:28.815
and then the rest
of the herd will follow.

27:28.883 --> 27:30.817
We were barely able
to get that foal back here.

27:30.885 --> 27:32.185
He fought us
every step of the way.

27:32.254 --> 27:33.721
How do you expect
to lead him back to the herd?

27:33.788 --> 27:34.955
I can work him.

27:35.022 --> 27:36.790
Yeah, I can get him
halter-broke.

27:36.858 --> 27:37.924
Working a foal takes time.

27:37.992 --> 27:39.525
And patience.

27:39.593 --> 27:40.926
But there's nothing stronger

27:40.994 --> 27:43.696
than a mare's connection
to an unweaned foal.

27:43.764 --> 27:45.632
I can get them in,
Scott,

27:45.699 --> 27:47.867
but I can't rush this.

27:47.934 --> 27:51.003
<i>So I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>to buy me some time.</i>

27:51.071 --> 27:52.605
We can you ask
the Band Council

27:52.673 --> 27:55.440
to back off
for a couple more days.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.178
All right, fine.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.847
Give it a shot.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.953
Tim:
Okay, I'm here.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.289
Where are the boxes?

28:11.356 --> 28:12.290
Lou: We were supposed to meet

28:12.357 --> 28:13.457
first thing this morning,
Dad.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.792
And when you didn't
show up,

28:14.859 --> 28:17.194
we moved the rest
into the Quonset ourselves.

28:17.262 --> 28:18.663
I'm sorry, Jack,
but I'm a busy man.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.030
I got a lot of things
on the go.

28:20.098 --> 28:21.899
What happened
to your face?

28:21.966 --> 28:23.167
Oh, oh... nothing.

28:24.169 --> 28:25.336
Agh!

28:25.404 --> 28:26.270
Are you okay?

28:26.338 --> 28:28.070
God that's hot!

28:28.138 --> 28:29.539
It's coffee, Tim.

28:33.010 --> 28:34.010
Bye.

28:40.217 --> 28:42.419
You need the halter?

28:42.486 --> 28:46.021
No, I'm just gonna see
how skittish he is.

28:46.088 --> 28:48.290
You want me to come in?

28:48.358 --> 28:52.060
He needs to get used
to me, first.

29:09.545 --> 29:12.480
So, what do you think?
Did he get into a fight?

29:12.548 --> 29:15.749
Yeah, there's only one way
to get a shiner like that.

29:15.817 --> 29:16.850
Great.

29:17.785 --> 29:19.285
So what's going on
with him anyway?

29:19.354 --> 29:21.755
Oh, I don't know,
but it can't be good.

29:23.057 --> 29:25.058
I'll have
a little chat with him.

29:25.125 --> 29:27.160
(Screen door bangs shut)

29:30.365 --> 29:32.565
Mallory:
I'm cancelling my party.

29:32.632 --> 29:33.666
Why?

29:35.101 --> 29:36.736
Because I'm not giving them
the satisfaction,

29:36.803 --> 29:37.970
that's why!

29:38.037 --> 29:39.938
Who? What? Mallory,
I'm not following you.

29:40.006 --> 29:41.273
My parents.

29:41.341 --> 29:42.675
Austin was right;
They're just buying me off

29:42.743 --> 29:45.244
with the sweet sixteen party
because guess what?

29:47.280 --> 29:49.213
We're moving to Nashville.

29:49.281 --> 29:50.882
What?

29:50.949 --> 29:53.317
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Yeah. Nashville.
</i> <i>Nobody even asked me.</i>

29:53.386 --> 29:55.119
They just decided
we're going,

29:55.187 --> 29:57.422
like what I want
doesn't even matter.

29:57.490 --> 29:58.523
Oh, Mallory...

29:59.759 --> 30:00.792
(Crying)

30:03.028 --> 30:04.528
(Foal whinnies)

30:04.596 --> 30:06.096
Amy:
I know... I know...

30:07.064 --> 30:08.699
It's okay.

30:08.767 --> 30:09.767
Come here...

30:16.040 --> 30:17.774
Good boy...

30:17.841 --> 30:19.409
You think he's ready
for this?

30:19.476 --> 30:21.978
Well, might as well
give it a try.

30:22.046 --> 30:23.079
You got him?

30:23.147 --> 30:24.014
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

30:24.081 --> 30:26.149
You're okay.
Good boy...

30:27.083 --> 30:30.152
What's this, huh?
It's okay.

30:30.220 --> 30:31.686
I know.
It's okay.

30:32.655 --> 30:33.688
Good boy.

30:33.756 --> 30:35.524
(Foal whinnies)

30:36.793 --> 30:38.760
Hey, I know.

30:38.828 --> 30:40.963
I know, I know.
You don't like that.

30:41.031 --> 30:42.298
It's okay.

30:42.365 --> 30:43.531
That's good.

30:44.633 --> 30:46.434
It's okay.
Hey, good boy.

30:48.637 --> 30:51.172
There.
That's not so bad.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.440
Nice job.

30:53.275 --> 30:55.009
It's okay,
we're gonna find your mom.

30:55.077 --> 30:57.078
(Whinnies)
I know.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.979
We'll find her.

30:59.047 --> 31:00.847
<i>(Horse whinnies nearby)</i>

31:00.915 --> 31:01.748
Amy, look.

31:06.955 --> 31:07.988
(Horses whinny)

31:08.056 --> 31:10.057
I told you
this would work.

31:12.493 --> 31:13.526
(Whinny)

31:16.696 --> 31:18.130
(Truck rumbles)

31:28.308 --> 31:30.276
(Grimaces in pain)

31:30.344 --> 31:32.310
Something happen
to your hand?

31:32.378 --> 31:33.611
No, it's fine.

31:34.580 --> 31:36.448
Funny that.

31:36.515 --> 31:39.384
Tim showed up at the ranch
with a black eye.

31:40.353 --> 31:42.153
That is funny.

31:42.221 --> 31:43.888
I'm not surprised someone
decked him though,

31:43.956 --> 31:45.090
the way he's been acting.

31:45.157 --> 31:47.458
You know, he's a real jerk
when he's...

31:47.525 --> 31:48.825
When he's what?

31:49.794 --> 31:53.230
Nothin'... he's just being
a real jerk is all.

31:53.298 --> 31:54.965
Well, I'm not making
excuses for him,

31:55.033 --> 31:58.602
but he is going through
a tough time right now.

31:58.669 --> 32:01.372
I guess people tend to do
whatever eases the pain.

32:06.276 --> 32:07.210
Ty:
Easy...

32:07.277 --> 32:08.544
Amy:
It's okay.

32:09.713 --> 32:10.746
Ty:
Easy...

32:13.417 --> 32:17.120
(Foal snorts and grunts,
herd horses whinny)

32:21.491 --> 32:22.690
Damn it.

32:25.761 --> 32:28.796
Come on,
let's follow them in.

32:30.633 --> 32:31.900
(Horses whinny)

32:45.780 --> 32:47.181
(Gunshots blast)

32:47.249 --> 32:48.382
(Horses whinny
and thunder away)

32:48.450 --> 32:49.783
Ty:
Whoa! Easy! Easy!

32:49.851 --> 32:52.385
Amy: Don't let him go!
Don't let him go!

32:52.453 --> 32:53.786
Ty! Hang on!

32:53.854 --> 32:54.820
Ty: I got him, I got
him, I got him!

32:54.888 --> 32:56.222
<i>Hold on! Hold on!</i>

32:56.290 --> 32:57.257
Amy: Don't let go of the rope!

32:57.324 --> 32:58.724
Ty:
Easy, easy, easy.

32:59.660 --> 33:02.195
(Foal whinnies loudly,
gunshot blasts)

36:57.249 --> 36:58.349
<i>(Truck roars)</i>

33:19.157 --> 33:21.057
Scott:
You shoot at those horses?!

33:21.125 --> 33:22.125
Don:
No I didn't.

33:22.193 --> 33:23.393
I fired a couple
in the air

33:23.460 --> 33:24.928
to scare them
up into the bush.

33:24.996 --> 33:26.729
I want them as far away
from my horses as possible.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.064
Amy was with them!

33:28.132 --> 33:29.399
She could've been killed
when they spooked!

33:29.466 --> 33:31.101
What?
I didn't see her.

33:31.168 --> 33:32.135
She was with the foal.

33:32.203 --> 33:33.669
Well, she shouldn't
have been.

33:33.737 --> 33:35.538
Whatever you're trying to do,
it's not gonna work.

33:35.606 --> 33:36.439
The herd's going
to be destroyed

33:36.507 --> 33:38.673
and that's that.

33:38.741 --> 33:40.609
Is this about the herd,
or me?

33:40.676 --> 33:43.245
You think I care where you go
or what happens to you?

33:43.313 --> 33:46.181
I care about my animals
and my business!

33:48.118 --> 33:49.484
If you go anywhere
near that herd,

33:49.552 --> 33:50.685
or my friends,

33:50.753 --> 33:52.621
you'll answer to me!

33:52.688 --> 33:54.422
You understand?

33:56.691 --> 33:57.125
Hey!

33:59.228 --> 34:02.063
That girl, Amy,
is she okay?

34:04.266 --> 34:05.366
Yeah.

34:08.703 --> 34:11.737
Mallory: They can't just take
my entire life away from me.

34:11.806 --> 34:12.871
I'm staying here.

34:13.873 --> 34:15.309
Why?

34:15.376 --> 34:17.677
I'd jump at the chance
to get out of Hudson.

34:17.745 --> 34:19.246
A place like
Nashville?

34:19.313 --> 34:21.214
You should go.

34:21.282 --> 34:23.483
Give me
one good reason.

34:23.551 --> 34:26.052
It's where all the big
country music labels are.

34:26.119 --> 34:28.387
So I could visit you.

34:29.688 --> 34:30.621
What?

34:30.690 --> 34:32.291
You don't get it.

34:32.359 --> 34:33.659
I'm leaving,

34:33.726 --> 34:35.828
and you're supposed to be
upset that I'm leaving.

34:35.895 --> 34:37.964
I am.
I'm just saying-

34:38.031 --> 34:39.966
Please don't.
You've said enough.

34:43.870 --> 34:47.138
I don't think this is
ever gonna work out.

34:47.206 --> 34:50.476
We want totally
different things.

34:50.543 --> 34:53.512
Are you breaking up
with me?

34:53.580 --> 34:55.981
Yeah.
I think I am.

34:56.047 --> 34:58.048
You're kidding.

34:58.116 --> 35:01.051
Because I think Nashville
is more exciting than Hudson?

35:01.119 --> 35:03.220
No. Because you think
Nashville's

35:03.288 --> 35:05.623
more exciting than me.

35:08.093 --> 35:11.295
(Music plays in the Diner,
people chatter quietly)

35:11.363 --> 35:12.697
(Truck rumbles)

35:17.869 --> 35:19.669
April:
Did you talk to Don?

35:19.737 --> 35:21.437
Uh-huh.

35:21.772 --> 35:24.173
April: I take it you're not
planning to tell me what was said.

35:24.241 --> 35:25.976
Nope.

35:26.043 --> 35:28.979
Amy: Well, did you buy us some
time with the Band Council?

35:29.046 --> 35:31.446
I tried,
but no extension.

35:31.515 --> 35:33.115
So we're gonna have
to move fast.

35:33.182 --> 35:34.182
<i>Go get that foal,</i>

35:34.250 --> 35:35.551
take him to the herd

35:35.619 --> 35:36.919
and hopefully you can lead
them back here.

35:36.987 --> 35:38.821
We'll get the inoculations
ready to go.

35:38.889 --> 35:41.123
Are you sure?
What about Don?

35:41.190 --> 35:43.291
He won't be bothering us
any more.

35:48.764 --> 35:50.164
(Street buzzes with chatter)

35:53.903 --> 35:55.803
You okay?

35:56.772 --> 35:58.039
(Sighs)

35:58.106 --> 35:59.140
Yeah, fine.

36:02.109 --> 36:03.309
<i>Oh, by the way,</i>

36:03.377 --> 36:04.210
you don't have to make up
an excuse

36:04.278 --> 36:05.846
not to come to my party.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.213
It's cancelled.

36:07.281 --> 36:08.649
How come?

36:08.716 --> 36:11.084
I don't really feel like
celebrating any more.

36:11.152 --> 36:12.586
Something wrong?

36:12.654 --> 36:14.655
Yeah. Everything.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.757
Did you have a fight
with Austin?

36:17.824 --> 36:20.325
We're not together any more.

36:20.393 --> 36:22.394
But you don't want to hear
about my problems.

36:22.462 --> 36:25.164
You got "a lot going on",
right?

36:27.567 --> 36:28.867
(Sighs heavily)

36:31.304 --> 36:32.571
(Foal whinnies)

36:37.277 --> 36:38.610
Amy: (Very quietly) Look.

36:38.678 --> 36:41.546
Let's go in there
nice and quiet and easy.

36:41.613 --> 36:43.314
Ty:
(Whispers) Okay.

36:47.086 --> 36:48.786
Amy: We'll let the
mare see her foal.

36:48.853 --> 36:50.221
Then we'll let her
come to us.

36:50.289 --> 36:52.523
- Okay.
- We won't chase her.

36:54.993 --> 36:56.294
(Foal whinnies)

36:57.928 --> 37:00.230
(Mare whinnies in response)

37:05.970 --> 37:07.070

and whinny nervously)

37:07.138 --> 37:09.473
(Mare whinnies)

37:20.850 --> 37:22.518
Good girl.

37:22.586 --> 37:24.786
You gonna follow us?

37:25.722 --> 37:27.423
(Mare snorts softly)

37:29.291 --> 37:30.691
I don't care!

37:30.759 --> 37:33.628
Just put...
Put Shane in the court,

37:33.695 --> 37:34.996
in front of the judge,

37:35.063 --> 37:37.098
and ask him
who he'd rather live with.

37:37.166 --> 37:38.433
Are you kidding me?

37:38.501 --> 37:39.601
He's gonna say,
I wanna be with my dad!

37:39.668 --> 37:41.736
I wanna be with real family!
Horses?

37:41.803 --> 37:43.471
Come on!

37:43.539 --> 37:47.608
She can sit there
and listen to it, all right?

37:47.675 --> 37:49.443
No. Agh!

37:49.511 --> 37:51.245
Fine. I'll talk to you
tomorrow.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.646
Jack:
(Disgusted) Well...

37:52.713 --> 37:54.314
Yeah, I feel like
I've seen this movie before.

37:54.382 --> 37:55.915
Oh, what movie's that?

37:55.983 --> 37:57.417
Jack: Let's see...
Letting your daughter down,

37:57.485 --> 37:58.652
the early morning shakes,

37:58.719 --> 38:00.220
yelling threats
into a phone...

38:00.288 --> 38:01.554
Whatever.
Getting into a fist fight

38:01.622 --> 38:03.189
with one of the few people
on the planet

38:03.257 --> 38:04.590
who still looks up
to you.

38:04.658 --> 38:06.892
(Laughs) You actually
listen to what Caleb says?

38:06.960 --> 38:08.361
Caleb didn't say anything.

38:08.428 --> 38:09.862
He doesn't have to.
I know you're back drinking.

38:09.929 --> 38:11.497
I can handle it!

38:11.565 --> 38:13.299
You want to be a father
to that boy at all?

38:13.367 --> 38:14.367
It's none of your business.

38:14.434 --> 38:15.801
Just get outta my way!

38:15.869 --> 38:17.202
You keep digging, Tim.

38:17.270 --> 38:19.103
The hole just keeps
getting deeper.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.205
Tim: (Mocking) Oh, I bet!

38:20.273 --> 38:22.607
I bet it's gonna get
real deep there.

38:22.675 --> 38:23.675
Shut up!

All right, last one.

39:21.124 --> 39:23.125
All right,
there you go.

39:23.192 --> 39:25.593
They're all fully
inoculated.

39:30.833 --> 39:33.635
April:
God, they are so beautiful.

39:33.702 --> 39:38.172
No wonder your grandfather
looked after them.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.006
He would've been
very proud of you.

39:40.074 --> 39:42.042
(Approaching hoof beats)

irregular temperatures.

No mucous irritations,

39:52.854 --> 39:55.021
uh, no respiratory
abnormalities.

39:55.089 --> 39:56.456
They're all healthy animals.

39:56.523 --> 40:00.526
No threat to your
cutting horses, Don.

40:19.545 --> 40:21.179

40:22.348 --> 40:24.048
Even when I'm having
a bad day,

40:24.116 --> 40:26.885
you can put a smile
on my face.

40:26.953 --> 40:28.819
(Katie coos)

40:28.887 --> 40:31.321
So did you have your chat
with Dad?

40:32.858 --> 40:34.725
No. No, I never did
track him down.

40:36.495 --> 40:39.162
So what made this day
so bad?

40:39.230 --> 40:41.198
Oh, I don't know.

40:42.501 --> 40:45.034
Seems like everybody's
moving away.

40:46.103 --> 40:48.972
I'm not even gonna have
Mallory around any more now.

40:51.008 --> 40:53.042
Think of all
the peace and quiet.

40:54.144 --> 40:56.178
A man gets used
to the noise.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.982
I thought you couldn't wait
to get rid of us.

40:59.049 --> 41:02.784
I know you need
your own home now,

41:02.852 --> 41:05.053
it just doesn't mean
I want you to leave.

41:05.121 --> 41:09.290
Grandpa, we are gonna be
just down the road, okay,

41:09.358 --> 41:11.960

than you want us to.

41:16.097 --> 41:18.833
And about this-
this dad stuff...

41:19.902 --> 41:21.636
Don't even worry
about it

41:21.703 --> 41:26.774
because he's probably just
having one of his moods.

41:26.842 --> 41:29.243
Yeah,
you're probably right.

you're gonna win,

41:37.484 --> 41:39.819
The boy's gonna pick me
over you every time

41:40.755 --> 41:42.822
and we're gonna make sure
that the court hears it

41:42.890 --> 41:44.223
loud and clear.

41:45.860 --> 41:48.193
Put the boy before
yourself for once,

41:49.228 --> 41:50.262
'cause I'm gonna fight you.

41:50.329 --> 41:51.396
I'll fight you...

all the time.

43:03.398 --> 43:05.166
I miss him too.

43:06.435 --> 43:08.603
But you know your grandfather
wasn't the only person here

43:08.670 --> 43:10.505
who cared about you.

43:11.873 --> 43:13.707
After he died,

43:13.775 --> 43:16.409
you didn't have
to stay away.

43:19.747 --> 43:21.515
People move on.
We both did.

43:24.985 --> 43:27.254
Thanks for doing this.

43:27.321 --> 43:30.223
I know it wasn't easy
for you.

43:30.291 --> 43:32.125
No.

43:32.192 --> 43:33.893
But it was worth it.

43:36.997 --> 43:38.831
Maybe you can come back,

43:38.899 --> 43:40.867
look in on the place
sometime

43:40.934 --> 43:43.002
so I don't have to.

43:44.138 --> 43:46.472
Would you want me to?

44:05.957 --> 44:07.491
(Gates clank open)

44:11.196 --> 44:13.463
(Horses whinny
as they thunder way)
