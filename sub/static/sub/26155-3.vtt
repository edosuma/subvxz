10:40.390 --> 10:42.642
- Yeah.
- This is great.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.728
The winged butterfly position,
right?

10:44.728 --> 10:46.146
We figured it out, I think.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.856
I feel like I could
sit like this forever.

10:47.856 --> 10:48.940
Yeah, same here.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.776
[inhales, mutters]

10:50.776 --> 10:53.362
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- I am in immense pain, yes.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.405
[both groan]

10:55.405 --> 10:56.865
Oh, I really thought
that I would be

10:56.865 --> 10:58.617
a lot more flexible
after death.

10:58.617 --> 10:59.618
[groans]

11:02.746 --> 11:05.499
Hey, um, I want
to show you something.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.126
- Right now?
- Yeah.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.796
It's a little bit of a walk.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.507
But I promise you,
it's worth it.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.259
Okay, let's go.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.471
Look, here it is!

11:19.471 --> 11:21.139
[chuckles]

11:21.139 --> 11:22.516
The lake house.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.892
It's close enough
to the fountain.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.352
We can come here
whenever we want.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.978
This is great.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.690
[Oscar] Amazed that I found it.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.778
It's exactly
how I remember it.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.531
- Just like old times, huh?
- Yeah.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.619
Hmm.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.664
We had some good times
on that couch.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.457
- What?
- Sorry, it sounded sexual.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.710
But I was mostly talking
about when we played Uno.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.671
Uh-huh.
[laughs]

11:52.671 --> 11:54.881
So what should we do
when we're here?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.883
Should we walk down
by the lake?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.261
We could go out
and sit on the back porch.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.762
We could take a nap.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.222
[man] You guys
have fun fishing?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.224
[girl] Yeah, that was
very fun, Daddy.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.184
[man] Thank you.
- Who the fuck are these people?

12:06.184 --> 12:08.145
[woman]
That was really fun, Daddy.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.646
What the hell is happening?

12:09.646 --> 12:11.398
Oscar, I have
to be honest with you.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.608
I sold this house
a few months ago.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.861
I just didn't know
if I would use it that much.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.404
[man] Oh, my God.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.322
He's got his wet boots
right on the floor.

12:19.322 --> 12:23.368
I'm so sorry.
It was a really tough decision.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.997
You know what?

12:26.997 --> 12:28.623
It might be fine.

12:28.623 --> 12:31.251
They don't know we're here.
They can't see us.

12:31.251 --> 12:35.172
I mean, we can still
do whatever we want.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.174
- Yeah.
- [family chattering]

12:37.174 --> 12:39.634
Okay.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.431
[both exhale]

12:44.431 --> 12:47.309
I missed this.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.061
Me too.

12:50.061 --> 12:54.566
[geese honking]

12:54.566 --> 12:57.319
Is that a Canada goose?

12:57.319 --> 13:00.405
Uh-huh, yep.
I think it is.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.115
[both chuckle]

13:02.115 --> 13:04.784
That's mine!
Give me back my bracelet!

13:04.784 --> 13:06.495
- No, I want to wear it!
- It's mine!

13:06.495 --> 13:08.622
Separate, separate!
I will take away your phones!

13:08.622 --> 13:10.665
[girl] She started it.
[man] Get inside.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.209
- No.
- Stupid.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.002
- Idiot.
- Hey, would you...

13:14.002 --> 13:16.254
This is...
We're having fun here!

13:16.254 --> 13:17.923
This isn't gonna work.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.511
- Maybe we should go?
- No.

13:22.511 --> 13:25.639
No, this is our lake house.
We were so happy here.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.933
- I know that, but...
- There's plenty of cabins

13:27.933 --> 13:29.392
around here.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.937
These people
can find another one.

13:31.937 --> 13:35.524
I don't see why
they would ever leave, though.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.776
Come on, guys.
Really?

13:37.776 --> 13:39.819
I thought you'd be
better than this.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.112
What do you mean?

13:41.112 --> 13:43.031
I know
what you're getting at.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.326
Well, what do you think
I'm getting at?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.537
You want us to...
[exhales]

13:48.537 --> 13:49.913
..."haunt them."

13:50.997 --> 13:53.458
When you say it like that,
it sounds stupid.

13:53.458 --> 13:57.420
I mean, could we even
do something like that?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.089
We can, but we don't.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.341
Our community, Formers,
we don't do that.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.968
- Well, why not?
- Well, first of all,

14:02.968 --> 14:04.886
it's really hard to do,
and it plays into

14:04.886 --> 14:06.263
stereotypes about us.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.139
We're just past that
as a culture.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.850
Okay, but what if...

14:10.850 --> 14:13.478
we told you you had to
because you're still a kid

14:13.478 --> 14:16.314
and we're adults and you
have to do whatever we say?

14:16.314 --> 14:18.066
Is she fucking joking
with this shit?

14:18.066 --> 14:19.693
We're sorry.
She's sorry.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.278
I'm fucking 58, lady.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.904
I'm older than you.
Show some respect.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.489
Okay, I'm sorry.
It just looks like you haven't

14:24.489 --> 14:25.782
gone through puberty yet.

14:25.782 --> 14:29.077
- Oh!
- Please, just...just this once.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.580
I mean, it's really
important to us.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.665
That was our special place.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.084
Ugh, your special place?
That sucks.

14:36.084 --> 14:39.087
- Why? Why does that suck?
- You know why.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.755
- Hey...
- [scoffs]

14:40.755 --> 14:42.632
...I'm asking you
as your buddy.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.885
How about this:
if I help you out,

14:45.885 --> 14:48.179
you have to cook me dinner
every night for a month.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.347
Are you kidding?

14:49.347 --> 14:50.890
I-I would love that.
Please, yes.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.100
Uh, we'll start with Italy.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.476
We'll do a food tour
of the world.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.353
Ugh, never mind,
maybe just a week.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.397
- Great, let's start tomorrow.
- No, maybe you can just

14:57.397 --> 14:59.107
make me a sandwich
at some point.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.151
- I would love that.
- No, forget that whole thing.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.861
Whatever, let's just go.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.321
Great!
Oh, you're a good friend.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.905
No, I'm not.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.657
Actually, I don't think
he is a good friend.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.161
No, he is. Just got
to give him a chance.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.747
[man] Oh, my God,
tater tots, so good.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.206
[man] Thank you, honey.
[woman] Thank you.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.958
[woman] Want a tomato?
[man] All right.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.752
Dudes, if you had just told me
the mom was this hot,

15:18.752 --> 15:20.128
I would have come right away.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.297
Isn't she a little young
for you, Grandpa?

15:22.297 --> 15:24.090
What are you talking about?
I'm 17.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.760
- You said you were 58.
- I'm both.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.304
[sighs]

15:29.304 --> 15:31.306
So why do you want to
get rid of these Orientals?

15:31.306 --> 15:33.808
Oh, come on,
you can't say "Orientals."

15:33.808 --> 15:36.770
- The term is "Asian-Americans."
- I'm from the '70s.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.688
It wasn't racist
to say anything back then.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.066
- People were cool.
- That is so not true.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.652
- What are you, by the way?
- Hey, okay.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.028
Now, what do we do?

15:45.028 --> 15:46.738
Get some sheets,
some chains or something?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.156
Jesus, follow me.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.658
We got to wait
until it's dark.

15:53.745 --> 15:57.374
So we're kind of limited with
what we can actually do here.

15:57.374 --> 16:01.294
All right, um,
what are our options?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.755
Let's try the light switch.
That's a classic.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.091
[Oscar] Okay.
- So first thing.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.926
You have to imagine
all the energy,

16:07.926 --> 16:10.303
emotions, whatever
in your body

16:10.303 --> 16:12.847
is flowing
to the tip of your finger.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.142
If you concentrate hard enough,
you'll feel a buzz.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.854
Then, and only then, will you
be able to flip the switch.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.439
[June] Hmm.
[Oscar] Okay, I got it.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.066
You want
to try it, honey?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.152
Check it out!

16:27.654 --> 16:30.782
- Go ahead, honey, just...
- I am.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.575
There you go,
just flip it.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.661
- That's it.
- [scoffs]

16:34.661 --> 16:36.746
Just go up.
Flick it up.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.624
You got this.
Here you go.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.835
- And up!
- [groans]

16:41.835 --> 16:43.044
It's kind of hard.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.921
Are you feeling
the buzz, honey?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.465
- Yeah!
- No, he's not, not even close.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.175
Well, maybe it's
his teacher's fault.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.719
Those instructions
were pretty vague.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.011
The instructions
were fine.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.388
Maybe he's distracted
by your nagging.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.973
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry, guys.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.391
Okay, I'm gonna get it.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.934
Okay, s-sometimes
it helps if you're angry.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.436
You...you can channel that
into your finger,

16:59.436 --> 17:00.979
like when you punch a wall.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.940
- [grunts]
- Come on, sweetie, you got it.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.567
- Come on!
- [grunts]

17:05.567 --> 17:09.446
That's it. That's right.
Come on, push it!

17:09.446 --> 17:11.406
[grunts]

17:11.406 --> 17:13.950
I can't get it, I'm sorry.
I think I hurt my finger too.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.285
- It's all right.
- All right, all right.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.494
Watch and learn.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.291
[breathing deeply]

17:24.502 --> 17:26.254
- [exhales]
- Whoa!

17:26.254 --> 17:28.631
- Amazing!
- Oh, my gosh!

17:28.631 --> 17:30.717
But it didn't work.
She's still sleeping.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.845
Aw, shit.

17:33.845 --> 17:37.265
Well, I can't do it again,
so we're out of luck.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.309
Well, can I give it a shot?

17:46.775 --> 17:49.778
[breathes deeply]

17:54.073 --> 17:55.658
- Oh, my God.
[Mark] Holy fuck!

17:55.658 --> 17:57.786
[gasps]
Oh, my God, look!

17:57.786 --> 17:59.704
- [laughs]
- [screams]

17:59.704 --> 18:02.916
I'm doing it!
Oh, shit!

18:02.916 --> 18:04.626
- Great, honey!
- Oh, my God!

18:04.626 --> 18:06.294
That was pretty good.

18:06.294 --> 18:09.214
What are you...
what are you so angry about?

18:09.214 --> 18:11.424
Nothing.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.426
Okay.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.512
[man] See, honey, it's not
doing it anymore.

18:15.512 --> 18:19.098
I saw it, I swear.
The light was going crazy.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.059
- It was super creepy.
- It's probably just

18:21.059 --> 18:22.519
a messed-up fuse or something.

18:22.519 --> 18:23.895
I will check again
in the morning.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.772
- In the meantime...
- No, no, no.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.525
[man] Just, it is so late...
- Yes, honey, come on!

18:28.525 --> 18:29.943
- The systems in this house...
- Get it.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.820
Let me at it.
Let me at it! Come on.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.238
...the electrical systems are,
like...they're really old.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.948
We have a big day tomorrow,
please?

18:34.948 --> 18:37.450
Oh, my God, look,
that horse fell over by itself.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.410
[man] That is weird.
[June] Uh-huh.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.912
I don't want
to sleep here tonight.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.706
Yeah, I don't think
you should be in here.

18:43.706 --> 18:47.418
Oh, yes!
Suck it, nice family!

18:48.461 --> 18:50.463
Family campout
in the living room!

18:50.463 --> 18:51.798
- Yay!
- Yeah!

18:51.798 --> 18:53.508
Oh, no, no, no, no,
what are they doing?

18:53.508 --> 18:56.177
- Who wants marshmallows?
- I do!

18:56.177 --> 18:57.637
This is a lot more fun

18:57.637 --> 18:59.305
than sleeping
in our stupid bedrooms.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.640
- Isn't it, guys?
[both] Yeah.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.267
This is
extremely frustrating.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.852
[woman] We'll probably
look back and laugh

19:03.852 --> 19:06.646
when we tell the story
of the time Allison saw...

19:06.646 --> 19:09.691
[dramatic voice]
the Lake House Ghost!

19:09.691 --> 19:11.150
- Boo!
- [all laugh]

19:11.150 --> 19:14.612
- Assholes!
[man] It's on, it's on, it's on!

19:14.612 --> 19:17.240
Honey, just...just think
of it like a wave

19:17.240 --> 19:19.158
flowing from your hand
to the object.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.660
None of the advice
has been helpful.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.996
- Hey, should we sing a song?
[all] Yes!

19:22.996 --> 19:24.581
