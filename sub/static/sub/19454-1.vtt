12:58.245 --> 13:01.546
<i> If you can go a little bit</i>
<i>higher and a little bit</i>
<i>further out.</i>

13:01.548 --> 13:07.085
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> Queen overboard.</i>
<i> Yes, gorgeous.</i>

13:07.087 --> 13:10.989
<i> She's giving you a young</i>
<i>julianne "howe."</i>
<i> Oh, yeah, julianne...</i>

13:10.991 --> 13:14.726
<i> Kelly Mantle.</i>

13:14.728 --> 13:17.328
<i> One, two...</i>

13:17.330 --> 13:20.965
<i>Three.</i>
<i>[Camera shutter clicking]</i>
<i>[Flat brass notes]</i>

13:20.967 --> 13:25.003
<i> Oh.</i>
<i> It's very Dorothy in</i>
<i>the wizard of oz,</i>

13:25.005 --> 13:28.740
<i>like, when she was in</i>
<i>the tornado.</i>
<i> [Laughing]</i>

13:28.742 --> 13:33.378
<i> You got one more chance.</i>
<i> You got one more try.</i>
<i>[Camera shutter clicking]</i>

13:33.380 --> 13:38.383
<i>There's no place like foam.</i>
<i>April carrion.</i>

13:38.385 --> 13:40.685
<i></i> <i>Tres, dos, uno.</i>

13:40.687 --> 13:45.824
<i>[Camera shutter clicking]</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>I am loving this new</i>

13:45.826 --> 13:48.459
<i>fall season.</i>
<i> Ah!</i>
<i>I can't get out.</i>

13:48.461 --> 13:52.330
<i> It's the boogie woogie</i>
<i>bugle queen.</i>
<i> We totally got the shot.</i>

13:52.332 --> 13:54.132
<i> Vivacious.</i>

13:54.134 --> 13:55.400
<i>There are two things I love</i>

13:55.402 --> 13:57.302
<i>about you:</i>

13:57.304 --> 13:58.269
<i>Your face.</i>

13:58.271 --> 14:02.907
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Let's go.</i>
<i>Do you have a name for</i>

14:02.909 --> 14:05.376
<i>the head on top of your head?</i>
<i> Ornacia.</i>

14:05.378 --> 14:07.412
<i> Ornacia, okay.</i>

14:07.414 --> 14:08.947
<i>I believe you can fly.</i>

14:08.949 --> 14:13.818
<i>[Camera shutter clicking]</i>
<i>Oh, no, you can't.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

14:13.820 --> 14:19.457
<i> [Groans]</i>
<i> Ornacia was giving me face,</i>
<i>but you, not so much.</i>

14:19.459 --> 14:24.796
<i>[Camera shutter clicks]</i>
<i> Oh, boy.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

14:24.798 --> 14:28.867
<i> Uh-huh.</i>
<i> We got a good shot.</i>
<i>I know it's a lot to wrap</i>

14:28.869 --> 14:34.806
<i>your head around.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> oh, my goodness.</i>

14:34.808 --> 14:37.342
<i>Mistake.</i>
<i> You did not jump with</i>
<i>that head on.</i>

14:37.344 --> 14:40.612
<i> Yes, I did, honey.</i>
<i> No!</i>
<i> You girls look different</i>

14:40.614 --> 14:42.947
<i>as men, honey.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

14:42.949 --> 14:45.049
<i> Dela definitely does not look</i>

14:45.051 --> 14:46.885
<i>the same out of drag.</i>

14:46.887 --> 14:50.555
<i>I could not clock the spook.</i>
<i> Well, I'm trying to give</i>
<i>a look, strolling across</i>

14:50.557 --> 14:56.127
<i>the room.</i>
<i> But Gia is still a lady boy</i>
<i>in or out of geish.</i>

14:56.129 --> 15:02.901
<i> I feel so free,</i>
<i>like free Willy.</i>
<i> Looking around the room,</i>

15:02.903 --> 15:08.172
<i>there's a lot of young queens.</i>
<i>Vivacious and I are probably</i>
<i>the older ones.</i>

15:08.174 --> 15:14.913
<i>I'm sure she's older, but</i>
<i>you know...</i>
<i> This is, like, my 21st year</i>

15:14.915 --> 15:19.317
<i>doing drag.</i>
<i> 22 years?</i>
<i> 21.</i>

15:19.319 --> 15:24.722
<i> I have been in drag for</i>
<i>17 years.</i>
<i> Ooh, you better do it.</i>

15:24.724 --> 15:28.226
<i> You can never stop learning,</i>
<i>you know?</i>
<i>You never stop studying</i>

15:28.228 --> 15:33.898
<i>your craft.</i>
<i> Kelly's drag caliber is</i>
<i>just not to where I would expect</i>

15:33.900 --> 15:40.638
<i>it to be for</i>
<i>an experienced queen.</i>
<i>If it's just not giving it,</i>

15:40.640 --> 15:43.074
<i>maybe it's just not for you.</i>

15:43.076 --> 15:50.748
<i> That is so cute.</i>
<i> Oh, thank you.</i>
<i>How is she, though?</i>

15:50.750 --> 15:58.356
<i> Girl, what?</i>
<i> How is she, though?</i>
<i> Fuck, all the way off.</i>

15:58.358 --> 16:03.161
<i>All these girls have these crazy</i>
<i>rhinestone dresses, and</i>
<i>i brought, like, four gowns</i>

16:03.163 --> 16:09.634
<i>with me, so that is making me</i>
<i>very insecure at this moment</i>
<i>in time.</i>

16:09.636 --> 16:16.107
<i> Hello, hello, hello.</i>
<i>[All talking at once]</i>
<i>i just finished binge-viewing</i>

16:16.109 --> 16:23.881
<i>your on-air photos.</i>
<i> Oh, honey.</i>
<i> And a couple of you fizzled,</i>

16:23.883 --> 16:31.155
<i>but one of you is a true</i>
<i>falling star.</i>
<i>The winner is...</i>

16:31.157 --> 16:39.297
<i>Laganja Estranja.</i>
<i>[Applause and laughter]</i>
<i> ooh!</i>

16:39.299 --> 16:44.502
<i>Honey, these legs</i>
<i>are everything.</i>
<i> Condragulations, Laganja.</i>

16:44.504 --> 16:49.574
<i> Thank you, ru.</i>
<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I totally forgot I am</i>

16:49.576 --> 16:54.045
<i>double-parked.</i>
<i>Girls, follow me.</i>

16:54.047 --> 17:04.789
<i>[Truck beeping]</i>
<i>[Horn blares]</i>
<i> RuPaul's storage whores?</i>

17:04.791 --> 17:07.258
<i> Oh.</i>
<i> Whoo!</i>
<i> Hey!</i>

17:07.260 --> 17:10.028
<i>Walk it out, walk it out,</i>
<i>walk it out!</i>
<i> Don't be jealous of</i>

17:10.030 --> 17:14.332
<i>my ruhaul.</i>
<i> Oh, girl!</i>
<i> So do you want to meet</i>

17:14.334 --> 17:19.537
<i>the other seven queens?</i>
<i> [Squeals]</i>
<i>[All talking at once]</i>

17:19.539 --> 17:26.911
<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i> Ooh, shit.</i>
<i>Goddamn motherfucker.</i>

17:26.913 --> 17:38.656
<i> Do you want to meet the other</i>
<i>seven queens?</i>
<i> [Squeals]</i>

17:38.658 --> 17:41.726
<i>[All talking at once]</i>

17:41.728 --> 17:47.865
<i> Well, first, you'll have</i>
<i>to survive this week's</i>
<i>main challenge.</i>

17:47.867 --> 17:53.137
<i> All: Oh.</i>
<i> These boxes contain items</i>
<i>inspired by some of TV's</i>

17:53.139 --> 17:55.640
<i>greatest hits.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> Okay.</i>

17:55.642 --> 18:01.913
<i> Now, using the junk from</i>
<i>one of these trunks, you need</i>
<i>to create your best high-fashion</i>

18:01.915 --> 18:05.450
<i>drag look.</i>
<i> Ooh.</i>
<i> Laganja, you won the mini</i>

18:05.452 --> 18:11.489
<i>challenge, so you get to assign</i>
<i>one box to each queen.</i>
<i> I'm going to choose</i>

18:11.491 --> 18:15.960
<i>dancing with the stars.</i>
<i> Good choice.</i>
<i> Okay, miss April, I'm</i>

18:15.962 --> 18:20.598
<i>thinking, because of your</i>
<i>entrance look, you might be able</i>
<i>to take</i> <i>duck dynasty</i> and make

18:20.600 --> 18:24.902
it work.
[Laughs]
Oh, really?

18:24.904 --> 18:28.272
<i>Duck dynasty.</i>
<i>Is that for real?</i>

18:28.274 --> 18:29.774
<i>[Sighs]</i>

18:29.776 --> 18:33.911
<i> Gia, darling.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go with</i> <i>keeping up</i>
<i>with the Kardashians.</i>

18:33.913 --> 18:38.483
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i> What about Vivacious?</i>
<i></i> The <i>game of thrones.</i>

18:38.485 --> 18:40.485
<i> Ooh!</i>

18:40.487 --> 18:44.322
<i> What do you have for Adore?</i>

18:44.324 --> 18:46.691
<i> I'm whispering</i> <i>golden girls.</i>

18:46.693 --> 18:47.391
<i>Like...</i>

18:47.393 --> 18:48.793
<i>[Whispering]</i> <i>Golden girls.</i>

18:48.795 --> 18:55.066
<i> For my sister, I think</i>
<i>i would like to go with</i>
<i>here comes honey boo boo.</i>

18:55.068 --> 19:00.338
<i> Oh, you fucking bitch!</i>
<i> Oh, really?</i>
<i> I said</i> <i>golden girls.</i>

19:00.340 --> 19:04.008
<i> Oh, shit.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, mama.</i>
<i> Oh, no!</i>

19:04.010 --> 19:07.778
<i>It's fucked up, man.</i>
<i>It's fucked up.</i>
<i> What do you have for</i>

19:07.780 --> 19:11.682
<i>Kelly Mantle?</i>
<i> I think I'm going to go with</i>
<i>the</i> "downtown" abbey.

19:11.684 --> 19:16.754
Well, that means that Ben de
LA creme gets <i>golden girls.</i>
<i> Thank you for being</i>

19:16.756 --> 19:20.525
<i>a friend.</i>
<i> Yes!</i>
<i> Gentlemen,</i>

19:20.527 --> 19:28.866
<i>start your engines,</i>
<i>and may the best woman win.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

19:28.868 --> 19:33.404
<i> Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>What do you think we got?</i>
<i> [Groans]</i>

19:33.406 --> 19:38.075
<i> Ooh, she got some</i>
<i>feathers, girl.</i>
<i> Laganja, you hooked me up.</i>

19:38.077 --> 19:46.484
<i> Thanks, mama, for being</i>
<i>so fishy to the fish.</i>
<i> It's all redneck stuff.</i>

19:46.486 --> 19:52.790
<i>It's crap.</i>
<i>I got a box full of crap.</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

19:52.792 --> 19:56.827
<i>Crap.</i>
<i>Like, literally crap.</i>
<i> How are you, April?</i>

19:56.829 --> 20:02.466
<i>Do you hate me yet?</i>
<i> Why would Laganja think</i>
<i>i can relate to this?</i>

20:02.468 --> 20:06.437
<i>Total crap.</i>
<i>[Sighs]</i>

20:06.439 --> 20:08.839
<i> She's fucked.</i>

20:08.841 --> 20:18.616
<i> Sketti.</i>
<i>I'm not happy that Laganja</i>
<i>gave me</i> <i>honey boo boo.</i>

20:18.618 --> 20:21.552
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>This smells so gross.</i>
<i>I don't know if it's</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:26.591
<i>her strategy.</i>
<i>I'm gonna heave.</i>
<i>But if she did that on purpose,</i>

20:26.593 --> 20:32.930
<i>then...</i>
<i> Karma </i>
<i> hello, hello, hello.</i>

20:32.932 --> 20:38.669
<i>[All talking at once]</i>
<i></i> <i>Here comeshoney boo boo.</i>
<i> [Laughing] Yeah.</i>

20:38.671 --> 20:41.272
<i> Adore.</i>
<i> Hi.</i>
<i> Darling.</i>

20:41.274 --> 20:46.344
<i>Yeah, you watch</i> <i>honey boo boo?</i>
<i> I do, but I wasn't happy</i>
<i>that I got this.</i>

20:46.346 --> 20:50.114
<i> You were also a contestant</i>
<i>on</i> <i>American idol.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

20:50.116 --> 20:54.252
<i> How does this experience</i>
<i>compare so far?</i>
<i> It's so crazy.</i>

20:54.254 --> 20:57.154
<i> Wait, which is crazy?</i>
<i> This is crazy.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

20:57.156 --> 21:02.793
<i> When I was 17, I appeared</i>
<i>on</i> <i>American idol.</i>
<i>I made it to the top 13.</i>

21:02.795 --> 21:08.799
<i>I'm proud of it, but I look</i>
<i>like a lesbian Jonas brother.</i>
<i> Now, do you sew?</i>

21:08.801 --> 21:12.103
<i> No.</i>
<i> I don't understand you</i>
<i>young queens who don't know</i>

21:12.105 --> 21:14.472
<i>how to sew.</i>
<i>I don't get that.</i>
<i> I know.</i>

21:14.474 --> 21:16.841
<i>I'll glue it or something.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> I'm very, like, passionate</i>

21:16.843 --> 21:20.177
<i>about this.</i>
<i> Baby, I think you'd better</i>
<i>chug-a-lug some go-go juice</i>

21:20.179 --> 21:25.983
<i>real quick and make it happen.</i>
<i> [Cries]</i>
<i> Vivacious.</i>

21:25.985 --> 21:29.153
<i> Hi, ru, how are you?</i>
<i> Hi, darling.</i>
<i>Now,</i> <i>game of thrones.</i>

21:29.155 --> 21:32.456
<i>You ever watch that show?</i>
<i> Yes, I think it was</i>
<i>the queen's daughter went</i>

21:32.458 --> 21:35.593
<i>to one of the other kingdoms,</i>
<i>and she turned around and had</i>
<i>her dragon torch</i>

21:35.595 --> 21:40.197
<i>the whole kingdom.</i>
<i>So I'm just gonna try to get</i>
<i>this as feminine as I possibly</i>

21:40.199 --> 21:47.305
<i>can with a cowl neck</i>
<i>and a baby dragon.</i>
<i> A baby dragon.</i>

21:47.307 --> 21:53.377
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>
<i>Well, we want to see</i> <i>game of</i>
<i>thrones</i> translated through

21:53.379 --> 21:58.983
your eyes.
Girl, it's got to scream
"Vivacious."

21:58.985 --> 22:02.620
Kelly Mantle.
Hey, ru.
You remind me...

22:02.622 --> 22:05.523
Uh-huh.
Of a young Carol Burnett.
[Sighs]

22:05.525 --> 22:08.659
She was my childhood idol.
She's the whole reason I even
started performing.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.962
Really?
Oh, yeah.
So you got <i>downton abbey.</i>

22:11.964 --> 22:15.166
<i>I see some sort of antique lace.</i>
<i>What are you gonna do for</i>
<i>the top?</i>

22:15.168 --> 22:20.604
<i> This was in the box, and</i>
<i>i started thinking, "this would</i>
<i>make such an amazing corset."</i>

22:20.606 --> 22:24.442
<i>Very Kate moss-y.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i>Listen, you use the experience</i>

22:24.444 --> 22:26.677
<i>that you have...</i>
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> And bring it to</i>

22:26.679 --> 22:32.350
<i>this challenge.</i>
<i> I will.</i>
<i> April. How are you?</i>

22:32.352 --> 22:36.320
<i> Hi, ru.</i>
<i> You got</i> <i>duck dynasty.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

22:36.322 --> 22:40.191
<i>I found these pants.</i>
<i> Oh, yeah, they're sort of</i>
<i>camouflage pants.</i>

22:40.193 --> 22:44.729
<i> I think I'm gonna really</i>
<i>tailor these into a high-waisted</i>
<i>pant just to make it</i>

22:44.731 --> 22:48.165
<i>high-fashion, you know,</i>
<i>'cause a pant can be hard</i>
<i>to translate into high fashion.</i>

22:48.167 --> 22:54.205
<i> Yeah, it can be.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> Especially if you're a man.</i>

22:54.207 --> 22:59.643
<i> Well, I think you need</i>
<i>to take a risk.</i>
<i> Hmm, okay.</i>

22:59.645 --> 23:04.281
<i> I'm scared shitless.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna lie, you know?</i>
<i>I can't be the first queen</i>

23:04.283 --> 23:09.120
<i>to go home.</i>
<i> G-g-g-Gia.</i>
<i> Hi, ru.</i>

23:09.122 --> 23:12.056
<i> You got</i> <i>the Kardashians.</i>
<i> Absolutely.</i>
<i> Now, you seem a little</i>

23:12.058 --> 23:16.761
<i>bit behind.</i>
<i> I need to make sure that</i>
<i>i have the idea together first.</i>

23:16.763 --> 23:22.133
<i> Right.</i>
<i> So I'm thinking, um,</i>
<i>some type of collar and maybe</i>

23:22.135 --> 23:27.271
<i>something, you know, like,</i>
<i>coming up here.</i>
<i>Maybe something flow-y, but I'm</i>

23:27.273 --> 23:36.046
<i>thinking I'm gonna go maybe,</i>
<i>like, very gown-ish.</i>
<i>Maybe, like, a dress?</i>

23:36.048 --> 23:42.286
<i> I don't have any idea</i>
<i>what you--</i>
<i>[Laughing] what you're gonna do.</i>

23:42.288 --> 23:47.057
<i>And I'm worried that you</i>
<i>don't either.</i>
<i> Oof, ru just clocked me.</i>

23:47.059 --> 23:49.460
<i> All right, listen.</i>
<i>I'm gonna let you get back</i>
<i>to work.</i>

23:49.462 --> 23:52.463
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> All right, see you.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

23:52.465 --> 23:56.834
<i> All right, ladies.</i>
<i>Gather round.</i>
<i>Later, you'll be making your</i>

23:56.836 --> 24:04.942
<i>main stage debut, and we'll be</i>
<i>joined by our extra special</i>
<i>guest judge, my American idol,</i>

24:04.944 --> 24:11.615
<i>Adam lambert.</i>
<i>[Cheers and applause]</i>
<i>so don't fuck it up.</i>

24:11.617 --> 24:18.222
<i>[Pulsing electronic music]</i>
<i> </i>

24:18.224 --> 24:19.390
<i> The stakes are high.</i>

24:19.392 --> 24:20.658
<i> I can't even think properly.</i>

24:20.660 --> 24:24.061
<i> Girl.</i>
<i> The first queen goes home</i>
<i>today, and no one wants to be</i>

24:24.063 --> 24:30.801
<i>that girl.</i>
<i> How do you take this off?</i>
<i>So I may have or may have not</i>

24:30.803 --> 24:36.040
<i>glued my garment to</i>
<i>my mannequin.</i>
<i>This is so horrible.</i>

24:36.042 --> 24:39.743
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>I'm fucking ripping</i>
<i>my whole dress.</i>

24:39.745 --> 24:42.713
<i> You good, baby?</i>
<i> Go ahead, babe.</i>
<i>[Speaking indistinctly]</i>

24:42.715 --> 24:47.985
<i> I make one attempt to help</i>
<i>the bitch get the ensemble off</i>
<i>of the mannequin.</i>

24:47.987 --> 24:52.690
<i>It was impossible.</i>
<i> I don't know what the fuck</i>
<i>I'm gonna do.</i>

24:52.692 --> 24:57.995
<i>These bitches are basically</i>
<i>ready at this point.</i>
<i>I'm freaking the fuck out.</i>

24:57.997 --> 25:04.034
<i>Fuck!</i>

25:04.036 --> 25:21.085

<i>And Mike ruiz.</i>

<i>Did you fall for any of my</i>

<i>girls yesterday?</i>

26:03.696 --> 26:04.361
<i> I did.</i>

26:04.363 --> 26:05.763
<i>I fell hard.</i>

26:05.765 --> 26:07.064
<i> [Laughs]</i>

26:07.066 --> 26:08.732
<i>And President of the glambert</i>

26:08.734 --> 26:11.702
<i>nation, Adam lambert is here.</i>

26:11.704 --> 26:13.270
<i>You look really good tonight.</i>

26:13.272 --> 26:15.573
<i> Oh, thank you.</i>
<i>So do you.</i>
<i> Oh, thank you.</i>

26:15.575 --> 26:17.975
<i>What are you doing after</i>
<i>the show?</i>
<i> Anything you want.</i>

26:17.977 --> 26:22.580
<i>[Both laugh]</i>
<i> For this week's big opening,</i>
<i>we challenged our first seven</i>

26:22.582 --> 26:30.487
<i>queens to take leftovers from</i>
<i>TV's greatest hits and create</i>
<i>their very own runway couture.</i>

26:30.489 --> 26:35.659
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines,</i>
<i>and may the best woman win.</i>

26:35.661 --> 26:37.728
<i>Now, sissy that walk.</i>

26:37.730 --> 26:40.097
<i>G-g-g-Gia.</i>

26:40.099 --> 26:40.931
<i>Keeping up with</i>

26:42.535 --> 26:43.233

26:43.235 --> 26:44.602
<i>the kard-asians.</i>

26:44.604 --> 26:48.572
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> So I'm the first one out</i>
<i>on the runway.</i>

26:48.574 --> 26:52.376
<i>I'm ready to set the tone</i>
<i>for those bitches that have</i>
<i>to follow me.</i>

26:52.378 --> 26:59.416
<i>My legs are bronzed and tanned</i>
<i>for the gods, serving up</i>
<i>Kim k. Realness.</i>

26:59.418 --> 27:02.753
<i> Is that the long-lost sister,</i>
<i>Mei ling Kardashian?</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

27:02.755 --> 27:06.523
<i> Kimora Lee kard-Asian.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

27:06.525 --> 27:08.025
<i> April carrion,</i>

<i>serving</i> "tuck" dynasty.

27:10.296 --> 27:10.961
[Laughs]

27:10.963 --> 27:11.662
[Quacks]

27:11.664 --> 27:12.796
Is that a decoy in her

27:12.798 --> 27:13.964
pocket, or is she just happy

27:13.966 --> 27:14.965
to see me?

27:14.967 --> 27:19.103
[Laughter]
I'm walking on the runway
for the first time ever,

27:19.105 --> 27:24.341
and I'm rocking it.
I can see Adam lambert watching
these thighs.

27:24.343 --> 27:28.479
He wants some chicken legs.
I know it.
Taking her duck out

27:28.481 --> 27:31.715
for a drag.
[Laughter]

27:31.717 --> 27:33.884
Laganja Estranja,

27:33.886 --> 27:35.819
serving <i>dancing with the stars.</i>

27:35.821 --> 27:37.921
<i>Nomi Malone,</i> <i>showgirls.</i>

<i>Very queen of the night.</i>

27:39.091 --> 27:43.994
<i>Whitney, where's your bodyguard?</i>
<i>Oh, she's going that way.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

27:43.996 --> 27:48.565
<i> They can't handle me.</i>
<i>It's leg for days,</i>
<i>train for months,</i>

27:48.567 --> 27:55.773
<i>and face for years.</i>
<i> Whoa!</i>
<i> Hey, solid gold.</i>

<i>Kelly Mantle.</i>

<i> Oh, Christine baranksi's</i>

<i>in the house.</i>

28:01.881 --> 28:02.846
<i>[Laughter]</i>

28:02.848 --> 28:08.952
<i> I've got my hair.</i>
<i>I've got my makeup did.</i>
<i>I've got my 28-inch waist.</i>

28:08.954 --> 28:12.923
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>I am working it like a '90s</i>
<i>runway model.</i>

28:12.925 --> 28:16.060
<i> There's some kristen wiig-y</i>
<i>in there.</i>
<i> She getting wiig-y with it?</i>

28:16.062 --> 28:19.463
<i> Uh-oh, hey.</i>
<i> [Laughing]</i>

<i> I'd bet $100,000 would make</i>

28:25.504 --> 28:26.503
<i>her holler.</i>

28:26.505 --> 28:31.742
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> I'm scared.</i>
<i>I look like a fucking mess,</i>

28:31.744 --> 28:38.248
<i>but I do not want to go home,</i>
<i>so I need to sell this garment</i>

Hey.

Mary j. In the house.

28:51.530 --> 28:56.900
That's right.
<i>Game of thrones</i> in the 411.
[Laughter]

28:56.902 --> 29:00.270
I am walking down that
runway, and I am serving it
down, miss thing.

29:00.272 --> 29:07.244
I am giving you old-school style
New York walk, walk, walk, pose.
What time is it on your crow?

29:07.246 --> 29:10.581
Welcome to her queendom.
Ain't no red wedding here.
Uh-uh.

29:10.583 --> 29:14.318
Ben de LA creme,

29:14.320 --> 29:16.987
serving <i>golden girls.</i>

29:16.989 --> 29:18.756

29:20.059 --> 29:24.695
<i> [Laughing]</i>
<i> Ben de LA creme visage.</i>
<i> It's my firstborn.</i>

29:24.697 --> 29:28.465
<i> I'm giving Ben de LA creme</i>
<i>in her full glory.</i>
<i>I'm giving them the sex appeal,</i>

29:28.467 --> 29:32.603
<i>but I'm also giving them</i>
<i>the camp and the fun and</i>
<i>the goofiness.</i>

29:32.605 --> 29:35.539
<i> Cheesecake.</i>
<i> Mmm, eat it.</i>

29:35.541 --> 29:38.075
<i> Now, sissy that walk.</i>

29:38.077 --> 29:39.409
<i> I felt like it was boy.</i>

29:39.411 --> 29:40.377
<i> You're tripping.</i>

29:40.379 --> 29:41.812
<i> That skirt is horrible.</i>

29:41.814 --> 29:44.181
<i> Hideous.</i>

29:44.183 --> 29:55.659
<i> Welcome, ladies.</i>
<i>It's time for the judges'</i>
<i>critiques.</i>

29:55.661 --> 29:59.563
<i> I think your look is</i>

29:59.565 --> 30:00.798
<i>well-assembled.</i>

30:00.800 --> 30:02.266
<i>Your hair is flawless.</i>

30:02.268 --> 30:03.066
<i> I could tell that you're</i>

30:03.068 --> 30:04.301
<i>the feisty one.</i>

30:04.303 --> 30:05.302
<i> Absolutely.</i>

30:05.304 --> 30:09.773
<i> One thing I want you to be</i>
<i>conscious of: A Booty with</i>
<i>an open leg cuts your leg.</i>

30:09.775 --> 30:14.278
<i> Absolutely.</i>
<i> I like the Booty.</i>
<i> Thank you, Gia.</i>

30:14.280 --> 30:19.550
<i> Absolutely.</i>
<i> April carrion, I'm very</i>
<i>excited that you changed your</i>

30:19.552 --> 30:24.721
<i>mind about that pair of pants.</i>
<i> The pants weren't fitting,</i>
<i>and I looked like a crazy</i>

30:24.723 --> 30:26.490
<i>man, really.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

30:26.492 --> 30:27.724
<i> You did a really amazing job</i>

30:27.726 --> 30:29.092
<i>at taking hyper-masculine</i>

30:29.094 --> 30:30.494
<i>elements and making</i>

30:30.496 --> 30:32.196
<i>a feminine look.</i>

30:32.198 --> 30:33.330
<i> You are gorgeous.</i>

30:33.332 --> 30:34.031
<i> Well, you're gorgeous</i>

30:34.033 --> 30:34.698
<i>as well.</i>

30:34.700 --> 30:38.068
<i> Oh, thank you.</i>
<i> Get a room.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

30:38.070 --> 30:43.140
<i> Up next, Laganja Estranja.</i>
<i> Hey, girl.</i>
<i> Laganja, you're tripping</i>

30:43.142 --> 30:46.410
<i>on the skirt.</i>
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> Also lost your neckline</i>

30:46.412 --> 30:49.279
<i>completely.</i>
<i> Right.</i>
<i> I'm kind of loving how</i>

30:49.281 --> 30:53.350
<i>your hair blends into the top.</i>
<i>I think it's interesting.</i>
<i> Absolutely.</i>

30:53.352 --> 30:57.387
<i> But I need more fish from</i>
<i>you onstage.</i>
<i>I felt like it was boy.</i>

30:57.389 --> 31:01.491
<i> [Obnoxiously] Okay.</i>
<i> You are filled with energy,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

31:01.493 --> 31:08.098
<i> Yes, God.</i>
<i> Thank you, Laganja.</i>
<i>All right, Kelly Mantle.</i>

31:08.100 --> 31:12.069
<i> Is that bacon on your chest?</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> What is it?</i>

31:12.071 --> 31:18.275
<i> They're flower pedals.</i>
<i> I'm still getting bacon.</i>
<i> I think I was focusing more</i>

31:18.277 --> 31:21.879
<i>on the high-fashion part of it.</i>
<i> 'Cause nothing says</i>
<i>high fashion like</i>

31:21.881 --> 31:25.916
<i>white polyester.</i>
<i>That skirt is horrible.</i>
<i> Horrible?</i>

31:25.918 --> 31:28.785
<i> Horrible.</i>
<i> Say what you will about</i>
<i>the materials, but I think</i>

31:28.787 --> 31:33.457
<i>it's very feminine, and</i>
<i>i like that.</i>
<i> Adore Delano, tell me about</i>

31:33.459 --> 31:38.829
<i>this outfit.</i>
<i> Well, um...</i>
<i>I had a vision.</i>

31:38.831 --> 31:45.402
<i>Like, if I was an '80s mermaid</i>
<i>who got her prom done by, like,</i>
<i>heatherette when he first</i>

31:45.404 --> 31:49.172
<i>started, didn't have</i>
<i>a sewing machine.</i>
<i> [Laughing]</i>

31:49.174 --> 31:54.077
<i> Just learning how to make</i>
<i>something out of something.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

31:54.079 --> 31:58.081
<i> I think you are so</i>
<i>freaking cute.</i>
<i> Oh, thank you.</i>

31:58.083 --> 32:02.019
<i> But it's pretty much fabric</i>
<i>wrapped around your body</i>
<i>with a belt.</i>

32:02.021 --> 32:06.590
<i> I'm not loving this outfit.</i>
<i>The execution of the whole thing</i>
<i>is not there.</i>

32:06.592 --> 32:11.395
<i> You know, you want to take</i>
<i>that one last look in the mirror</i>
<i>before you hit the runway.</i>

32:11.397 --> 32:15.332
<i> All right, next up,</i>
<i>Vivacious.</i>
<i> I can always tell when</i>

32:15.334 --> 32:18.835
<i>a new yorker walks the runway,</i>
<i>because we have that kind</i>
<i>of ball walk, that pepper</i>

32:18.837 --> 32:22.306
<i>labeija kind of--</i>
<i> okay.</i>
<i> Yes, honey.</i>

32:22.308 --> 32:25.042
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i>It's like this weird combination</i>
<i>of Carol Channing meets</i>

32:25.044 --> 32:28.211
<i>Edgar Allan poe.</i>
<i> Oh, okay.</i>
<i> You know, you don't want to</i>

32:28.213 --> 32:31.014
<i>combine those two.</i>
<i>You just don't.</i>
<i> The worst part of your look</i>

32:31.016 --> 32:35.218
<i>is the hemline.</i>
<i>It's just like you ran out</i>
<i>of fabric.</i>

32:35.220 --> 32:39.256
<i> Next up, Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i> Did you sew this?</i>
<i> I didn't.</i>

32:39.258 --> 32:42.826
<i>This is all just hot glue</i>
<i>and desperation from head</i>
<i>to toe.</i>

32:42.828 --> 32:46.330
<i>I wanted the craftsmanship to</i>
<i>go with the</i> <i>golden girls</i> theme
and look like it was made by

32:46.332 --> 32:50.434
old arthritic hands.
[Laughter]
It's couture.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.704
It's a concept.
It's stunning.
All right, dela,

32:53.706 --> 32:59.242
thank you very much.
Now, while you untuck in
the form decor lounge, the

32:59.244 --> 33:05.549
judges and I will deliberate.
Just between us--we're all
friends--what do you think?

33:05.551 --> 33:10.887
Let's start with Gia Gunn.
I wasn't thoroughly impressed
by the ensemble she

33:10.889 --> 33:14.958
put together.
I'm not trying to be shady,
but I didn't really like her

33:14.960 --> 33:17.461
when she was talking.
You know, her answer to
everything was,

33:17.463 --> 33:19.896
"oh, absolutely,"
you know, before we even
finished the comment.

33:19.898 --> 33:23.100
But she was able to work
the garment.
Let's talk about

33:23.102 --> 33:27.771
April carrion.
I think she's beautiful.
The face, the body, and also

33:27.773 --> 33:31.742
the outfit I thought was really
high-fashion.
She hammered this challenge.

33:31.744 --> 33:37.381
For me, I've never been a fan
when drag queens use their own
hair, and, if they do use their

33:37.383 --> 33:41.785
own hair, it can't have a man's
buzz cut back there.
I kind of thought it was

33:41.787 --> 33:44.054
kind of hot.
Because you want to
fuck her.

33:44.056 --> 33:50.060
[Laughing]
Next up, Laganja Estranja.
The thing around her head and

33:50.062 --> 33:56.266
then this elizabethan collar and
then that schmata...
On the bottom, it was just--

33:56.268 --> 34:00.537
[imitates dejected tone]
I liked that it was odd.
There were certain proportions

34:00.539 --> 34:04.608
she was making with her hair
going into that collar.
But I think she's just trying

34:04.610 --> 34:07.377
too hard.
With her personality,
like, "uh-huh, mama,"

34:07.379 --> 34:10.781
you know, and, like, all of
that, it's just annoying.
Right.

34:10.783 --> 34:14.651
You know, when I see old footage
of me from around that age,
I'm trying so hard.

34:14.653 --> 34:20.123
I wish I could sit myself down
and go, "just be yourself."
All right, let's move on to

34:20.125 --> 34:24.194
Kelly Mantle.
Ordinarily everything is
better wrapped in bacon,

34:24.196 --> 34:28.298
but not Kelly.
[Laughter]
Well, from top to bottom,

34:28.300 --> 34:32.402
it was off.
That was a shake-and-go wig.
The makeup was terrible.

34:32.404 --> 34:36.139
She was very lackluster,
but, despite that fact, I do
feel like there's something

34:36.141 --> 34:39.042
underneath.
I agree.
You know, she's intelligent,

34:39.044 --> 34:44.614
she's funny, and she's
a seasoned queen.
Next up, Adore Delano.

34:44.616 --> 34:52.122
Now, her outfit was hideous.
I think she's got that "it"
thing that not all these

34:52.124 --> 34:56.126
girls have.
She is charming, and she
understands how to deliver

34:56.128 --> 35:00.664
a joke.
But it was just a mess.
All right, next up,

35:00.666 --> 35:05.836
Vivacious.
Girl, I think the hairline
started down here.

35:05.838 --> 35:10.474
[Laughter]
Well, she represents that
really underground club

35:10.476 --> 35:14.644
storyline.
Was she able to translate that
into her challenge?

35:14.646 --> 35:17.981
No, I don't--I don't get
that at all, but that walk
was everything.

35:17.983 --> 35:21.418
I was fascinated by
her character.
I want to see what she has

35:21.420 --> 35:24.754
in store.
All right, next up,
Ben de LA creme.

35:24.756 --> 35:30.694
I was so impressed with
what she glued together.
I mean, that was snatched

35:30.696 --> 35:34.531
on her body.
It was so fitted on her hips
and her waist.

35:34.533 --> 35:38.568
It was like a couture gown.
It really was.
You know, she has this character

35:38.570 --> 35:42.739
that she does.
She kind of has a '50s
<i>i love Lucy</i> comedic kind

35:42.741 --> 35:47.244
of vibe.
But that personality can get
old real quick.

35:47.246 --> 35:53.316
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my squirrels.

35:53.318 --> 36:09.399
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
First, I will not be granting

36:09.401 --> 36:17.807
immunity this season.
Period.
Make every moment count.

36:17.809 --> 36:28.685
Gia Gunn...
You're safe.
[Silently] Thank you.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.921
Laganja Estranja...

36:30.923 --> 36:39.396
You're safe.
Thank you.
April carrion...

36:39.398 --> 36:41.765
You're safe.

36:41.767 --> 36:54.010
Ben de LA creme...
You were serving cheesecake
and left us gagging for more.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.413
Condragulations, you're
the winner of this
week's challenge.

36:56.415 --> 37:02.018
Yes.
Thank you so much.
You'll receive a custom jewel

37:02.020 --> 37:06.656
package from fierce drag jewels.
[All cheer]

37:06.658 --> 37:16.666
Kelly Mantle...
Your runway look was a little
downton shabby.

37:16.668 --> 37:25.008
I'm sorry, but you're up
for elimination.
Adore Delano, your couture

37:25.010 --> 37:36.386
was a honey of a boo boo.
Vivacious, your runway strut
was pure vogue, but your outfit

37:36.388 --> 37:43.593
was vague.
Vivacious...

37:43.595 --> 37:52.902
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
Adore, you are safe.

37:52.904 --> 38:00.844
Thank you.
You may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.

38:00.846 --> 38:10.387
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.

38:10.389 --> 38:18.328
The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life.

38:18.330 --> 38:21.298
I don't know what Kelly has,

38:21.300 --> 38:22.766
but I know one thing:

38:22.768 --> 38:25.335
I know how to eat a stage.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.970
Good luck,

38:26.972 --> 38:28.638
and don't fuck it up.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.440
Come on, girls.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.575
Do you believe in love?

38:32.577 --> 38:37.447
'Cause I got something
to say about it, and it goes
something like this.

38:37.449 --> 38:43.420
Don't go for second best
baby
put your love to the test

38:43.422 --> 38:47.590
you know, you know
you've got to
make him express

38:47.592 --> 38:53.863
how he feels
and maybe then you'll know
your love is real

38:53.865 --> 38:56.733
Kelly is serving face,

38:56.735 --> 38:58.368
serving lip-synching,

38:58.370 --> 39:00.036
but then Vivacious, she's, like,

39:00.038 --> 39:02.772
strutting like--

39:02.774 --> 39:04.407
and I'm feeling that.

39:04.409 --> 39:07.277
I'm believing.
I'm believing.
They never last

39:07.279 --> 39:13.883
no, no
you got to make him
express himself

39:13.885 --> 39:16.820
I would've thought <i>express</i>

39:16.822 --> 39:19.856
<i>yourself</i> is up Kelly's Avenue

39:19.858 --> 39:22.425
or more to her age group.

39:22.427 --> 39:29.466
Express what he's got
oh, baby, ready or not
express yourself

39:29.468 --> 39:32.535
[cheers and applause]

39:32.537 --> 39:39.142
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

39:39.144 --> 39:51.755
Vivacious,
shante, you stay.
Thank you, ru.

39:51.757 --> 40:01.131
You may join the other girls.
Kelly Mantle, I am so glad
we had this time together.

40:01.133 --> 40:10.273
Now, sashay away.
[Laughs]
Unfortunately I didn't get to

40:10.275 --> 40:15.311
stick around to sing or act,
but I'm not a sewer.
I have little sweatshops in

40:15.313 --> 40:21.885
van nuys that does that for me.
Don't wear bacon.
Don't wear bacon.

40:21.887 --> 40:28.024
Ladies, condragulations
for making it through my first
big opening.

40:28.026 --> 40:33.830
Next week, seven new queens
arrive to compete for the very
first time, and the week after

40:33.832 --> 40:39.402
that, your two groups
will merge.
And then, child, it's gonna get

40:39.404 --> 40:45.475
severe up in here.
[All talking at once]
Now, remember, if you can't

40:45.477 --> 40:50.180
love yourself, how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?

40:50.182 --> 40:53.450
All: Amen!
All right, now let
the music play.

40:53.452 --> 41:03.259
Yeah!
[Upbeat electronic music]

41:03.261 --> 41:04.861
Bye!
