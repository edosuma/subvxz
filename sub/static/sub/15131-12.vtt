[rapid beeping]

00:35.888 --> 00:37.121
[flatline]

00:37.257 --> 00:39.469
I'll go.

00:40.993 --> 00:43.127
[P.A. beeps]

00:43.161 --> 00:44.795
Woman: <i>Code blue, I.C.U.</i>

00:44.829 --> 00:46.663

- [sighs]

00:46.698 --> 00:48.599
[P.A. beeps]

00:58.410 --> 01:00.877
Hey. It's Dawn Bell.

01:00.912 --> 01:03.046
Oh, yeah, I guess it <i>is</i> early.

01:03.081 --> 01:04.280
Um, listen, I don't think

01:04.315 --> 01:06.883
I'm gonna be able to do that drink tonight.

01:06.918 --> 01:09.552
'Cause I just don't think
that I have the time.

01:09.587 --> 01:10.854
Sorry. Bye.

01:10.888 --> 01:13.556
Dr. Bell, you've got to come quick.

01:15.692 --> 01:17.760
[flatline]

01:20.797 --> 01:22.898
He went into V-fib at 6:09.

01:22.966 --> 01:24.767
He's been in arrest less than 60 seconds.

01:24.801 --> 01:26.736
Charge to 200. [paddles whine]

01:26.803 --> 01:27.903
Clear.

01:27.938 --> 01:30.072
[thump]

01:30.107 --> 01:31.874
[flatline]

01:33.476 --> 01:35.544
We're going again. [paddles whine]

01:35.578 --> 01:37.713
Clear. [thump]

01:37.748 --> 01:39.081

Maggie, come take over.
Walk me through how you do this.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.573
Maggie.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.475
Maggie!

[sighs]

02:13.816 --> 02:15.850
[indistinct conversations]

02:18.520 --> 02:20.454
I am <i>so,</i> so sorry.

02:20.522 --> 02:22.156
You were actually asleep in there,

02:22.224 --> 02:23.791
standing up, with your eyes open.

02:23.858 --> 02:25.025
I haven't been sleeping.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.794
It's this shift
and studying for boards and...

02:26.861 --> 02:28.796
- It can't happen again.
- I know. It won't.

02:28.863 --> 02:30.231
This is when residents fall apart,

02:30.299 --> 02:31.465
the ones who don't make it.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.334
- You think I won't make it?
- I know how it is.

02:33.368 --> 02:34.968
You want to put patients
before your studies,

02:35.036 --> 02:36.404
but if you fail your boards,

02:36.471 --> 02:38.605
you won't <i>have</i> any patients
because... not a doctor.

02:38.673 --> 02:42.542
I'm on top of it. I've got to go.

02:47.048 --> 02:49.649
I need to find a place to curl up and die.

02:49.718 --> 02:52.485
- Are we canceling?
- No, we are not canceling.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.256
We are studying as a group,
starting right now.

02:56.324 --> 02:57.924
[cellphone vibrates]

02:57.991 --> 02:59.259
[sighs] Or not.

02:59.327 --> 03:01.494
I forgot that I'm supposed to be
seeing Dr. Katz.

03:01.562 --> 03:04.097
Sorry. Got to go.

03:04.164 --> 03:06.966
Okay, so, <i>now</i> are we canceling?

03:07.034 --> 03:09.135
Do you want to fail a test with Dr. Bell?

03:09.203 --> 03:11.670
No, I do not want to fail
a practice test with Dr. Bell.

03:11.705 --> 03:13.172
I have 30 minutes. Let's do this.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.640
[sighing] Oh, gosh.

03:14.708 --> 03:17.143
Thanks for fitting me in.

03:17.177 --> 03:19.145
Happy to. But you're pretty far along.

03:19.179 --> 03:21.480
I assumed you'd chosen someone
else to follow your pregnancy.

03:21.514 --> 03:24.650
Well, you know I've been busy,
and I'm a bit superstitious.

03:24.684 --> 03:26.518
It's understandable. It's your first one.

03:26.553 --> 03:28.687
- Hop up.
- Okay.

03:28.722 --> 03:32.324
So, hospital birth? Midwife?

03:32.359 --> 03:34.326
Guess I have to start figuring all this out.

03:34.394 --> 03:36.161
Yeah, we'll schedule a talk
about the birth plan

03:36.195 --> 03:37.663
- when you're ready.
- Thanks.

03:37.731 --> 03:39.665
Now is the time when I usually ask

03:39.699 --> 03:41.367
about the father's involvement.

03:41.401 --> 03:43.369
I am not 100% sure who it is...

03:43.403 --> 03:44.803
I see.

03:44.837 --> 03:47.005
Which is not a situation
I expected to find myself in.

03:47.039 --> 03:49.340
There was just a bit of an overlap, so...

03:49.375 --> 03:51.309
- Joel and Charlie.
- Yep.

03:51.343 --> 03:53.478
And, presumably, they both think
they're the father...

03:53.512 --> 03:55.513
- "my boys are swimmers" and all that.
- Mm-hmm.

03:55.547 --> 03:58.650
- You thinking of a paternity test?
- I am.

03:58.684 --> 04:00.652
Okay. Well, there are some prenatal options.

04:00.686 --> 04:03.821
The most conclusive test is
something like an amniocentesis.

04:03.855 --> 04:07.224
But, Alex, the safest thing
to do right now is nothing.

04:07.259 --> 04:09.761
[chuckles] I think I might need to know.

04:09.795 --> 04:11.929
Give it some thought.

04:11.963 --> 04:14.732
If you can find a way to wait, so can they.

04:14.767 --> 04:17.500
Right.

04:17.535 --> 04:20.504
[indistinct conversations]

04:20.538 --> 04:23.507
[sighs] So cute.

04:23.541 --> 04:24.708
[high-pitched voice] Hello.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.543
Hello, princess.

04:26.577 --> 04:28.378
[normal voice] Hello.

04:28.413 --> 04:30.047
Cute. How old is she?

04:30.081 --> 04:32.049
Six months. And he's a <i>he.</i>

04:32.083 --> 04:33.450
- [chuckles]
- He's a he.

04:33.518 --> 04:36.186
Prince, then. Six months.
What are they like at this age?

04:36.220 --> 04:40.857
Oh, you know, uh, eat, cry, poop
[scoffs] not sleep.

04:40.891 --> 04:42.359
- Not sleep.
- Baby stuff.

04:42.393 --> 04:43.927
[chuckles]

04:43.961 --> 04:47.431
Decaf and a banana muffin, please.

04:47.465 --> 04:49.366
All right. [grunts]

04:49.400 --> 04:51.534
I'm sorry.

04:51.568 --> 04:53.203
Could you hold him a sec
while I get my money?

04:53.237 --> 04:54.871
Y... uh... of course I can.

04:54.905 --> 04:57.040
- Thanks.
- Hey. Oh, uh...

04:57.074 --> 04:58.875
Hello.

04:58.909 --> 05:00.877
Hello.

05:00.911 --> 05:02.345
How are you?

05:02.412 --> 05:05.381
Hello.

05:05.415 --> 05:07.182
You're just waking up.

05:07.250 --> 05:09.885
You're just waking up.

05:09.919 --> 05:12.054
That's... Nice baby.

05:12.088 --> 05:14.056
It's not my k...

05:14.090 --> 05:16.158
It's... not my kid.

05:16.526 --> 05:18.975
That's probably not the first time
you've been

05:19.025 --> 05:20.796
- defensive about something like that.
- Cute. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:20.864 --> 05:23.165
[inhales deeply] By the way, if you think
I'm gonna run away

05:23.233 --> 05:25.167
just 'cause, uh, Alex is pregnant right now,

05:25.235 --> 05:27.970
- you got another thing coming.
- Okay.

05:28.004 --> 05:30.138
I know this is probably pretty
difficult for you, Charlie.

05:30.206 --> 05:31.473
I'm not sure what "this" is.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.807
"This" being Alex being pregnant

05:32.876 --> 05:35.610
with what is almost certainly my kid, so...

05:35.678 --> 05:37.913
Oh. Yeah, I'm not getting my memos.

05:37.981 --> 05:39.947
I guess not. Yeah, well,
forget we said anything.

05:40.015 --> 05:41.282
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:41.350 --> 05:43.451
All right.

05:43.519 --> 05:44.952
Can I have my baby back, please?

05:45.020 --> 05:47.154
Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes. Here.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.524
So, how's it going with your, uh, legal...

05:49.558 --> 05:52.026
still out on bail.
Still owe Zach 50,000 bucks.

05:52.094 --> 05:54.161
- No new charges yet.
- Well, that's good.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.264
Not really. Until the prosecutor
makes a decision, I'm kind of in limbo.

05:57.314 --> 05:59.000
- Also, about the other thing...
- Yeah.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.931
Kind of want to know
where I stand with that.

06:00.981 --> 06:01.654
Yeah, me too.

06:01.704 --> 06:03.837
- What do we do about it?
- I don't know.

06:03.872 --> 06:05.172
[sighs, groans]

06:05.240 --> 06:06.507
Uh...

06:06.541 --> 06:08.342
Hey. What are you guys talking about?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.644
- Ultimate frisbee.
- Arabian... horses.

06:10.712 --> 06:12.813
Okay. Well, see you later.

06:12.881 --> 06:14.848
Okay.

06:14.883 --> 06:16.182
Yeesh.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.385
Hey, I need an ortho consult in here.

06:18.453 --> 06:19.853
Yeesh.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.488
One of you or both of you, I don't care.

06:21.556 --> 06:23.824
Just come.

06:23.892 --> 06:25.158
[sighs] I always go for scissors.

06:25.192 --> 06:27.227
Yeah!

06:27.295 --> 06:28.395
Okay, so, what do you got?

06:28.463 --> 06:29.662
Oh, just a fractured clavicle.

06:29.730 --> 06:31.231
Just a fractured... why do you need me?

06:31.265 --> 06:32.565
Guess I thought one of you guys

06:32.633 --> 06:34.234
might take a special interest in this one.

06:34.302 --> 06:38.071
- I'll take that.
- What do you mean, "a special inter..."

06:38.139 --> 06:40.573
Hi... Donny Petrillo.

06:40.607 --> 06:42.575
Um, how did you manage
to break your collarbone?

06:42.643 --> 06:45.412
Disagreement with a bouncer.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.747
Okay. Maybe not
the smartest move in the world.

06:47.781 --> 06:50.382
It's just... wow. Yep.

06:50.417 --> 06:53.218
Definitely broken, and I'm sorry about that.

06:53.253 --> 06:55.054
It's okay. I can take it.

06:55.121 --> 06:58.057
Um... I don't know
that you <i>can</i> take it.

06:58.091 --> 06:59.492
I mean, best-case scenario,

06:59.526 --> 07:00.860
you're gonna be in a sling
for at least a little while.

07:00.894 --> 07:02.227
How did you get the injury?

07:02.262 --> 07:04.796
Guy pinned my arm behind me,
slammed me into a wall.

07:04.831 --> 07:06.031
Felt the bone break.

07:06.066 --> 07:07.666
Okay, well, I'm gonna
send you in for an MRI,

07:07.700 --> 07:09.335
make sure there's no, uh, vascular damage.

07:10.557 --> 07:13.005
Oh, um, don't have any
existing orthopedic hardware

07:13.039 --> 07:14.340
I should know about, do you?

07:14.374 --> 07:16.541
You can't go through the MRI
with any metal in you.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.484
Do these count as orthopedic hardware?

07:29.254 --> 07:31.389
Yeah.

07:31.423 --> 07:33.124
Yes, they definitely do.

07:33.158 --> 07:35.360
Wow.

07:43.848 --> 07:45.216
[siren wails] [horn blares]

07:45.284 --> 07:46.250
[P.A. beeps]

07:46.285 --> 07:48.552
Man: <i>Dr. Frank to obstetrics.</i>

07:48.619 --> 07:50.721
<i>Dr. Frank to obstetrics.</i>
[knock on door]

07:50.789 --> 07:52.255
Dr. Rocca. Hi.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.757
Dr. Reid, thanks for coming.

07:53.792 --> 07:55.059
Alex, you're familiar

07:55.093 --> 07:57.561
with a patient in the I.C.U.
Named Elliot Stout?

07:57.595 --> 08:00.898
Yeah. The lawyer who's suing
Melanda and you.

08:00.932 --> 08:03.200
He went into V-fib arrest this morning.

08:03.267 --> 08:06.736
He's stable now, but between
this and his ongoing infection,

08:06.770 --> 08:09.105
his time here does not
reflect well on Hope Zion.

08:09.139 --> 08:10.773
Alex, we'd like to make Elliot Stout

08:10.808 --> 08:13.176
- your responsibility.
- Okay.

08:13.211 --> 08:14.477
I want you in the I.C.U. monitoring him.

08:14.545 --> 08:16.513
He will receive the highest standard of care

08:16.547 --> 08:19.249
and <i>nothing</i> to add to his
lawsuits against this hospital.

08:19.317 --> 08:22.051
Understood. I'll take care of it.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.253
Oh, and, um, congratulations.

08:24.287 --> 08:27.857
Thank you.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.226
- You going on shift?
- Oh, not scheduled.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.894
I'm just trying to catch up today.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.562
Mm. What's your weak spot?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.865
All of it? [sighs]

08:35.933 --> 08:38.267
Okay, the heart scares me most.

08:38.335 --> 08:41.437
Pediatric congenital cardiac abnormalities,

08:41.504 --> 08:43.105
atrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter,

08:43.172 --> 08:46.041
ACLS protocols, recognizing
the different arrhythmias...

08:46.109 --> 08:48.544
Okay. That's... that's a lot.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.113
Uh, do you have any time today?
You think you could help me?

08:51.163 --> 08:53.449
Lana, I'm in the E.R. all day,
and I can barely help myself.

08:53.483 --> 08:57.753
I know. I'm sorry. You've all been so nice.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.587
Just take the day to study.

08:59.655 --> 09:01.389
Try and observe a cardiac surgery.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.091
Books will only get you so far.

09:03.159 --> 09:04.159
Right.

09:04.227 --> 09:06.094
You'll be fine.

09:06.162 --> 09:07.896
We both will.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.298
Right.

09:10.366 --> 09:12.300
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:12.368 --> 09:14.969
- [clears throat]
- Perfect. Uh, Helen Kruger, bay 4.

09:15.003 --> 09:16.871
There's something wrong with her wrist,

09:16.938 --> 09:17.979
but she wouldn't let me take a look.

09:18.077 --> 09:21.075
I thought maybe you could, uh,
try a woman's touch.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.243
[sighing] Okay.

09:23.854 --> 09:24.779
Everything okay?

09:24.846 --> 09:27.101
I just fell asleep in the O.R.

09:27.193 --> 09:29.115
- Anyone die?
- No, thank god.

09:29.183 --> 09:30.350
Then don't sweat it.

09:30.385 --> 09:31.881
You kidding me? I fall asleep all the time.

09:31.931 --> 09:33.520
In fact, I might be sleeping right now.

09:33.554 --> 09:36.257
- Bay 4. I'll take that. Thanks.
- Wh... oh.

09:36.324 --> 09:37.925
Mrs. Kruger... oh.

09:37.993 --> 09:40.194
I hear you're having
some trouble with your wrist.

09:40.228 --> 09:42.830
- May I just take...
- I don't think I'm ready for that.

09:42.864 --> 09:44.564
Uh, well, it's sort of hard
for me to treat you

09:44.599 --> 09:45.832
if I don't know what's wrong.

09:45.866 --> 09:47.634
W-well, I thought
it was a good idea to come,

09:47.669 --> 09:49.469
but I've-I've changed my mind.

09:49.504 --> 09:51.805
Well, you have an ailment,
and you're in a hospital,

09:51.872 --> 09:53.640
so you're in the right place, okay?

09:53.675 --> 09:54.974
N-no, don't touch me!

09:55.009 --> 09:57.811
- [gasps]
- Okay, Helen, let's make a deal.

09:57.878 --> 09:59.313
If I leave you alone for a minute,

09:59.347 --> 10:00.446
do you promise not to leave?

10:00.514 --> 10:03.283
I want to help you.

10:03.317 --> 10:04.383
Just stay here.

10:04.418 --> 10:06.519
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

10:09.389 --> 10:11.024
[knock on door]

10:11.058 --> 10:13.193
Hey. I need your help.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.297
Jimmy.

10:18.332 --> 10:19.298
Hello?

10:19.333 --> 10:20.466
- Oh, my god!
- [gasps]

10:20.500 --> 10:24.036
No, you c... no, you can't do that to me.

10:24.070 --> 10:25.371
Uh, sorry. I'm sorry.

10:25.405 --> 10:27.707
I, uh... I need your help with a consult.

10:27.741 --> 10:29.842
I haven't actually started work yet.

10:29.876 --> 10:32.345
Were you meditating?

10:32.379 --> 10:34.012
Well, yeah, I <i>was.</i>

10:34.047 --> 10:36.048
- Is that effective?
- For what?

10:36.082 --> 10:38.350
Stress, insomnia, bad-hair day,

10:38.417 --> 10:40.853
just... loss of self-confidence?

10:40.887 --> 10:42.020
Most of those, yes.

10:42.055 --> 10:43.856
Also, it helps keep the voices down.

10:43.890 --> 10:44.923
You hear voices?

10:44.991 --> 10:46.925
Everyone does, to varying degrees.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.426
[sighing] Hmm.

10:48.461 --> 10:50.462
Well, after you help me with my patient,

10:50.496 --> 10:51.996
can-can you teach me that?

10:52.064 --> 10:54.065
Are you convincing me to do you a favor

10:54.099 --> 10:55.700
by asking an <i>additional</i> favor?

10:55.735 --> 10:57.201
Yes, I am.

10:57.236 --> 11:00.538
Well, points for chutzpah.

11:00.573 --> 11:01.706
[grunts]

11:01.741 --> 11:03.375
[indistinct talking over P.A.]

11:03.409 --> 11:05.009
[P.A. beeps]

11:05.077 --> 11:07.011
- You rang?
- Yes.

11:07.045 --> 11:08.812
Take a look at these.

11:08.881 --> 11:10.181
- Bilateral monorails.
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.215 --> 11:12.083
Pretty slick-looking.
Where did you get them?

11:12.117 --> 11:14.085
Hospital down in Aruba.

11:14.152 --> 11:16.220
That's a hell of an injury
to end up with this kind of hardware.

11:16.288 --> 11:19.290
Yeah. Skydiving school. Chute opened late.

11:19.324 --> 11:21.926
Yet another reason
to stay <i>inside</i> the airplane.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.627
So, you got these in Aruba.

11:23.661 --> 11:25.161
Yeah.

11:25.229 --> 11:27.063
"Hoolberg orthopedics."

11:27.131 --> 11:30.033
And, well, this is for what?

11:30.067 --> 11:33.437
I don't know. It just came that way.

11:36.307 --> 11:37.775
Your name, please?

11:37.809 --> 11:39.175
My name is Dr. Reid.

11:39.210 --> 11:41.611
Should any further misfortune befall me

11:41.678 --> 11:43.880
while in the care of this hospital,

11:43.948 --> 11:46.749
- I'd like to know who's involved.
- Oh, I see.

11:46.817 --> 11:48.584
Does that make you nervous?

11:48.652 --> 11:50.420
Not in the least.

11:50.487 --> 11:52.822
This little cardiac event of mine

11:52.890 --> 11:56.426
should bump me up a little
in transplant priority, no?

11:56.460 --> 11:59.429
All I can say is that we're
doing our very best for you.

11:59.496 --> 12:00.496
<i>Now.</i>

12:00.531 --> 12:02.331
Now you are.

12:02.399 --> 12:04.500
Well, your EKG readings look fine.

12:04.568 --> 12:06.669
We've got your C. diff infection
almost under control.

12:06.737 --> 12:08.671
I'll be back to check on you later.

12:08.705 --> 12:10.339
You know, before you go...

12:10.373 --> 12:14.343
this fever's made me a bit sweaty.

12:14.411 --> 12:18.013
Maybe you could give me a sponge bath.

12:18.048 --> 12:22.351
The nurses just don't do it right.

12:22.385 --> 12:24.586
Wonderful.

12:24.654 --> 12:27.122
[keys clacking]

12:31.193 --> 12:33.227
You little bastard.

12:35.731 --> 12:37.933
You lied to my face.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.604
[knock on door] Joel: Hey.

12:42.672 --> 12:44.539
So, am I good to go?

12:44.607 --> 12:47.541
Uh, just waiting on the C.T. results.

12:47.576 --> 12:49.177
Um, can I have a word?

12:53.015 --> 12:54.315
About what?

12:54.350 --> 12:57.285
About the fact that
you're limb-lengthening, Donny.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.454
- Sorry. I'm what?
- The monorails.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.488
You deliberately broke your legs.

13:00.538 --> 13:02.456
You're trying to lengthen
the bone so you can get taller.

13:02.491 --> 13:05.459
So what if I am?

13:05.494 --> 13:07.327
It's none of your business.
I'm here about my shoulder.

13:07.362 --> 13:08.562
Dangers of medical tourism aside,

13:08.597 --> 13:10.197
let me tell you
exactly what you're doing here.

13:10.231 --> 13:10.949
I know all the risks.

13:11.010 --> 13:13.333
You can distract the bone so
much, you won't heal properly.

13:13.368 --> 13:14.835
You can also overstretch the nerves,

13:14.870 --> 13:17.371
- so you're suffering incredible pain.
- I can handle pain.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.306
Buddy, you are lucky to still be walking.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.241
I guarantee you you're gonna be back here

13:21.275 --> 13:23.276
begging me to remove those things.

13:23.311 --> 13:25.912
Can you just get my results
so I can go home?

13:35.589 --> 13:38.558
Hi, Leila. Hi, Giselle.
How's everything going today?

13:38.592 --> 13:39.559
- It's good.
- Good.

13:39.593 --> 13:41.160
Keeping our spirits up.

13:41.194 --> 13:43.830
How's everything with
my favorite patient next door?

13:43.864 --> 13:47.934
[sighs] Mr. Stout has finally dozed off.

13:47.968 --> 13:49.435
Giselle, he asked me to thank you

13:49.469 --> 13:50.770
for running for help this morning.

13:50.804 --> 13:52.104
He says he owes you one.

13:52.139 --> 13:54.106
Wow. You should hold him to that.

13:54.141 --> 13:56.875
- That man's got connections.
- [chuckles]

13:59.579 --> 14:01.380
So, are you feeling okay?

14:01.415 --> 14:04.850
Yeah. You know, a little tired, weak.

14:04.918 --> 14:07.586
But everyone here has been so kind.

14:07.620 --> 14:10.022
It's sweet of you to do that.

14:10.056 --> 14:11.690
Taught her how.

14:11.724 --> 14:13.358
When she first came to foster with me,

14:13.392 --> 14:15.160
she wouldn't let me near her.

14:15.227 --> 14:16.828
Her hair was a matted mess.

14:16.896 --> 14:20.566
- It was not.
- Okay, maybe it wasn't.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.967
But, either way,

14:22.001 --> 14:23.969
she wouldn't let me near <i>it</i>
<i>or</i> <i>her</i> for months.

14:24.003 --> 14:25.036
Leila.

14:25.104 --> 14:27.572
Then one day, she let me wash it.

14:27.606 --> 14:31.042
Then I knew. Yeah, she felt at home.

14:31.110 --> 14:32.610
- Good.
- Yeah.

14:32.644 --> 14:35.947
- Can I come in?
- Mm-hmm.

14:35.981 --> 14:37.248
Come on.

14:37.316 --> 14:40.051
At least I'll know where you are.

14:40.119 --> 14:42.219
Alex, can I speak with you, please?

14:42.287 --> 14:45.089
Yeah. I'll be there in a moment.

14:45.156 --> 14:47.592
[sighs] That's good.

14:47.659 --> 14:49.426
We'll get you home as soon as we can.

14:49.494 --> 14:51.796
Okay.

14:51.863 --> 14:53.330
What's going on?

14:53.398 --> 14:55.666
Dawn just got the call.
We have a donor heart.

14:55.734 --> 14:57.568
- Where?
- South General.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.403
There are nine patients on the list

14:59.471 --> 15:01.405
who match in blood type and size.

15:01.473 --> 15:04.975
Of those, two are level 1
and highest priority.

15:05.009 --> 15:07.611
One is our friend, Elliot Stout,
but his C. diff infection

15:07.678 --> 15:09.179
temporarily takes him out of the running.

15:09.247 --> 15:11.773
So the next patient in line
is Leila Patterson.

15:11.861 --> 15:12.582
Yep.

15:12.617 --> 15:14.918
I'm gonna brief the donor team.
You prep Leila.

15:14.986 --> 15:16.452
Hopefully, if all goes well,

15:16.487 --> 15:18.287
she'll have a new heart by sundown.

15:18.355 --> 15:20.056
Okay.

15:22.827 --> 15:25.361
[monitor beeping]

15:26.864 --> 15:29.132
Hey. Did you forget something?

15:29.166 --> 15:30.866
I have some news.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.168
That doesn't sound good.

15:32.236 --> 15:33.836
No, it's good news.

15:33.903 --> 15:36.506
It seems like we may have
a donor heart for you.

15:36.573 --> 15:40.443
[chuckles] Are you serious?

15:40.477 --> 15:42.145
Now, we can't make any guarantees,

15:42.179 --> 15:43.712
but we need you to be prepared,

15:43.780 --> 15:45.881
'cause things could happen
very quickly today.

15:45.915 --> 15:49.151
Okay. Okay.

15:49.218 --> 15:50.819
You don't want to wake her?

15:50.887 --> 15:52.721
Uh, no. I just...

15:52.756 --> 15:55.057
I need a moment.

15:55.091 --> 15:56.391
I, um...

15:56.459 --> 15:58.694
I put on a brave face, you know?

15:58.728 --> 16:04.366
If I die, Giselle goes back into the system.

16:04.400 --> 16:08.836
I've got no one to take her...
so she'd be alone again.

16:08.904 --> 16:10.838
Try to think good thoughts, okay?

16:10.873 --> 16:12.207
We could have a real break here.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.309
Okay.

16:16.812 --> 16:18.746
Hey, "G." [inhales deeply]

16:18.781 --> 16:20.581
Wake up.

16:20.649 --> 16:21.582
What?

16:21.616 --> 16:23.250
[chuckles]

16:23.285 --> 16:26.253
Dr. Reid has some news.

16:26.288 --> 16:27.689
Do you have a heart for her?

16:27.723 --> 16:29.924
[chuckles] Yep.

16:29.958 --> 16:32.827
Yeah. [chuckles]

16:37.050 --> 16:38.777
Hey, Elliot.

16:38.811 --> 16:39.912
You look happy.

16:39.980 --> 16:42.248
Been stealing desserts from the elderly?

16:42.282 --> 16:45.017
[chuckles]
No. My mom's getting a new heart.

16:45.051 --> 16:47.186
We just found out. It's happening today.

16:47.220 --> 16:48.387
We might go home soon.

16:48.421 --> 16:50.389
This <i>is</i> inspiring news.

16:50.423 --> 16:52.691
I know.

16:52.759 --> 16:55.894
Um, I'm sure you'll get yours soon.

16:55.928 --> 16:57.161
[sighs]

16:57.196 --> 16:59.163
- Sorry. I didn't think...
- D-don't worry about it.

16:59.231 --> 17:01.199
I'm happy for you both.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.402
Tell your foster mother
good luck for me, will you?

17:03.436 --> 17:06.137
I'll tell you all about it when it's done.

17:19.417 --> 17:22.220
- Joel.
- Yeah?

17:22.288 --> 17:23.587
I got that C.T. scan on Donny Petrillo.

17:23.622 --> 17:24.954
Those legs are something else, huh?

17:25.022 --> 17:27.156
Yeah. That kid must be crazy
to put himself through that.

17:27.224 --> 17:28.826
I don't know...
people fix all sorts of things

17:28.894 --> 17:30.461
about themselves.
Why not height enhancement?

17:30.495 --> 17:32.262
Yeah, or you could just accept
yourself the way you are.

17:32.330 --> 17:33.497
Oh, come on. That is not fair.

17:33.532 --> 17:34.899
Look at you. You're like a perfect specimen.

17:34.966 --> 17:38.268
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- Medium height, average looks.

17:38.336 --> 17:39.937
- Small, <i>tiny,</i> little hands.
- They're not that tiny.

17:40.004 --> 17:41.305
I don't even know how you pick things up.

17:41.339 --> 17:42.605
Speaking of which, Alex Reid...

17:42.673 --> 17:44.942
we're all wondering who's the daddy.

17:45.009 --> 17:47.777
That's kind of Alex's business,
don't you think, Zach?

17:47.812 --> 17:48.812
No, I'd say it's kind of your business

17:48.846 --> 17:50.147
and Charlie's, too, though, no?

17:50.181 --> 17:51.614
I mean, I'd definitely
want to know if that was mine.

17:51.649 --> 17:52.749
Well, it's not yours, so you
don't have to worry about it.

17:52.783 --> 17:54.051
Maybe it's best, though, just to give her

17:54.118 --> 17:55.352
a little nudge to find out.

17:55.420 --> 17:58.855
How much money are you betting on this?

17:58.923 --> 18:00.790
- 100 bucks.
- What is wrong with you?

18:00.858 --> 18:02.091
On... who'd you bet on?

18:02.159 --> 18:03.021
You.

18:03.105 --> 18:06.095
Well, excellent choice,
but wildly inappropriate, Zach.

18:06.163 --> 18:07.597
Wait. Don't forget these.

18:07.665 --> 18:09.599
Also, in all seriousness...

18:09.667 --> 18:11.601
if you find out it's yours,
what are you gonna do?

18:11.669 --> 18:13.002
Are you gonna marry her,

18:13.070 --> 18:15.371
or do you think you'll just
seek employment elsewhere?

18:15.439 --> 18:17.206
I don't know. Are those my only two options?

18:17.274 --> 18:20.542
- In the paternity pool, yeah.
- Unbelievable.

18:22.312 --> 18:24.113
Hi, Helen. I'm Dr. Dey.

18:24.181 --> 18:26.782
Whoopee for you.

18:26.816 --> 18:29.885
Can you tell me
why you're so upset right now?

18:29.953 --> 18:31.353
I made a mistake coming here.

18:31.387 --> 18:32.488
No, you didn't.

18:32.522 --> 18:34.055
You need to have your wrist looked at.

18:34.090 --> 18:37.726
I understand that you might not
be ready to show it to us yet,

18:37.794 --> 18:40.061
but, uh, for a start, would you let Dr. Lin

18:40.096 --> 18:42.564
take your blood pressure, your temperature?

18:42.632 --> 18:44.533
I just want to make sure
you're in general good health.

18:44.567 --> 18:46.034
No blood?

18:46.068 --> 18:47.302
Not until you're ready.

18:47.370 --> 18:48.336
No blood.

18:48.371 --> 18:49.637
Jimmy: You don't like needles.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.006
Who <i>likes</i> needles?

18:51.040 --> 18:52.207
All we're asking

18:52.241 --> 18:55.043
is a blood-pressure cuff and a thermometer.

18:55.077 --> 18:57.879
I want out of here. That's...

18:57.946 --> 19:01.549
You don't have to make any
decisions right this moment.

19:01.583 --> 19:02.717
We're just talking.

19:02.751 --> 19:04.385
It's okay, Helen. You're safe, okay?

19:04.452 --> 19:05.386
[velcro rips]

19:05.420 --> 19:07.154
Stay back!

19:08.957 --> 19:10.558
Do you know what iatrophobia is?

19:10.592 --> 19:12.894
- It's fear of doctors, right?
- Fear of doctors.

19:12.928 --> 19:14.896
Well, everyone's afraid
of doctors, even other doctors.

19:14.963 --> 19:16.063
I mean, there have been studies...

19:16.097 --> 19:18.065
Iatrophobics take it to the next level,

19:18.099 --> 19:19.900
like our friend Helen here.

19:19.934 --> 19:22.503
Whispering about me is not helping.

19:22.537 --> 19:23.937
Okay.

19:23.971 --> 19:26.273
She's afraid of doctors.
I can't help being one.

19:26.307 --> 19:29.443
[whistles]

19:29.477 --> 19:30.810
Or maybe you can.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.348
Jimmy: So, taking away the
trappings of your profession

19:34.382 --> 19:36.349
may make it easier
for you to get close to her.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.518
Undercover doctor. I like it.

19:38.553 --> 19:41.521
So, you're, um... you're gonna... Uh, okay.

19:41.556 --> 19:42.856
[sniffs]

19:42.890 --> 19:45.025
You know about white-coat syndrome, right,

19:45.059 --> 19:46.693
where a patient's heart will beat faster

19:46.727 --> 19:48.695
just at the sight of a doctor?

19:48.729 --> 19:51.364
Sure, but what Helen has
is way worse than that.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.999
Right. Sometimes, it can be traced back

19:54.068 --> 19:57.036
to a traumatic experience
with a doctor in childhood

19:57.071 --> 20:02.208
or simply a more primal fear
of disease and mortality.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.211
[zipper closes] So what you're really
saying is she's afraid of bad news?

20:05.245 --> 20:07.046
Exactly. [clears throat]

20:07.081 --> 20:08.214
If you look hard enough,

20:08.248 --> 20:10.049
fear is the cause of most human behavior,

20:10.083 --> 20:12.250
fear and, uh... desire.

20:12.318 --> 20:15.087
Speaking of desire,
are you still celibate, Dr. Dey?

20:16.590 --> 20:18.891
Yeah. [exhales deeply]

20:18.925 --> 20:20.626
H-hanging in there.

20:22.361 --> 20:25.997
All right, we go on 3. 1, 2, 3.

20:26.031 --> 20:29.033
Very nice.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.836
How are you feeling?

20:31.870 --> 20:33.972
Good. I'm good.

20:34.006 --> 20:36.408
You know, if anyone
had to operate on my heart,

20:36.442 --> 20:37.942
I'd want it to be Dr. Bell.

20:38.010 --> 20:40.912
In fact, she did. [chuckles]

20:40.946 --> 20:42.747
And look at me now.

20:42.815 --> 20:44.548
Okay.

20:44.583 --> 20:45.817
Okay?

20:45.884 --> 20:48.019
Dr. Sharpe is gonna
put you to sleep in a minute.

20:48.087 --> 20:51.522
It's my special skill.
You should see me at parties.

20:51.556 --> 20:52.724
[chuckles]

20:52.791 --> 20:55.359
And then you put me on a heart-lung bypass?

20:55.427 --> 20:56.995
Mm-hmm.

20:57.029 --> 21:00.598
Crazy, thinking I won't
have a heart for a while.

21:00.665 --> 21:03.066
How long is it all gonna take?

21:03.135 --> 21:06.570
Four or five hours, maybe
a little longer with your LVAD.

21:06.638 --> 21:09.106
Okay.

21:09.174 --> 21:10.274
Leila, if you could start counting backwards

21:10.342 --> 21:11.442
from 100 for me...?

21:11.510 --> 21:14.512
100...

21:14.579 --> 21:15.846
We'll see you when you wake up.

21:15.913 --> 21:17.681
99...

21:17.749 --> 21:20.450
98...

21:20.518 --> 21:23.887
[groaning, breathing heavily]

21:25.957 --> 21:28.424
Hey, Donny, quit walking, man. Uh...

21:28.492 --> 21:31.094
Mate, it's no wonder
you can hardly feel your broken clavicle.

21:31.162 --> 21:32.762
You're in a whole other world of agony here.

21:32.829 --> 21:33.863
It's not a problem.

21:33.897 --> 21:36.086
- I beg to...
- I-I'm fine.

21:36.567 --> 21:38.201
I beg to differ with you.

21:38.235 --> 21:40.770
The C.T. shows
both your tibia are in malunion.

21:40.837 --> 21:45.441
I told you I wasn't here for my legs.

21:45.509 --> 21:46.942
They're not healing correctly,
Donny. Listen to me.

21:47.010 --> 21:48.778
Once we remove these torture devices,

21:48.812 --> 21:50.612
you're gonna be at risk for chronic pain,

21:50.647 --> 21:51.681
for possible re-fracture.

21:51.748 --> 21:53.182
All right, I...

21:53.249 --> 21:55.184
maybe I've been cranking a little faster

21:55.218 --> 21:57.219
than they told me to, but I'm close now.

21:57.287 --> 21:58.520
What do you mean you're close?

21:58.555 --> 21:59.889
I've always been a fast healer.

21:59.956 --> 22:03.392
And so you know, I already gained 2 inches.

22:03.426 --> 22:06.395
I just got one more to go.

22:06.429 --> 22:08.063
[crack]

22:08.130 --> 22:09.498
- Ohh! Aah!
- Okay. Okay.

22:09.566 --> 22:11.400
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:11.467 --> 22:12.801
Just try not to move, okay?

22:12.868 --> 22:15.571
- Nurse!
- [gasping]

22:15.605 --> 22:17.673
[monitor beeping]

22:19.609 --> 22:20.742
Dr. Sharpe?

22:20.810 --> 22:21.743
All good here.

22:21.777 --> 22:23.778
Scalpel.

22:25.881 --> 22:29.350
Starting with a midline incision.

22:29.384 --> 22:32.187
Dawn, a word.

22:33.923 --> 22:36.557
Not exactly the best time
for "a word," Neil.

22:36.592 --> 22:39.327
I'd rather not do this in front of everyone.

22:39.361 --> 22:40.861
Do what? What are you talking about?

22:40.895 --> 22:42.630
I'm taking your heart.

22:48.882 --> 22:49.901
There is <i>no</i> way

22:49.951 --> 22:51.487
that you are taking that heart
from my patient.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.527
Well, that is where you're wrong.

22:52.561 --> 22:53.694
Elliot Stout's infection

22:53.729 --> 22:55.530
bumped him down in transplant priority.

22:55.564 --> 22:58.866
His tests came back.
He's clear of his infection.

22:58.901 --> 23:00.367
You should have checked with me

23:00.402 --> 23:02.536
before you went and allocated
that heart to Leila Patterson.

23:02.570 --> 23:05.505
I don't need to check with you.
I am the chief of surgery.

23:06.274 --> 23:07.874
You can pull that card all you want,

23:07.909 --> 23:11.091
but the fact is
that this mix-up is your fault.

23:11.162 --> 23:12.746
While we are in here wasting time,

23:12.780 --> 23:14.714
they are extracting that donor heart.

23:14.749 --> 23:17.417
There is no turning back.
The clock is ticking.

23:17.452 --> 23:19.419
Elliot Stout had first priority.

23:19.454 --> 23:21.321
He only lost it because of hospital mistake.

23:21.388 --> 23:22.756
We cannot punish him for that.

23:22.824 --> 23:24.791
So you're gonna punish a single mother

23:24.826 --> 23:27.393
who was in the O.R. prepped
and ready for transplant?

23:27.462 --> 23:29.195
I didn't tell you
to go and get her hopes up.

23:29.229 --> 23:30.797
[sighs]

23:34.734 --> 23:37.536
Are you really going to deny a viable heart

23:37.571 --> 23:40.974
to a lawyer who's suing
this hospital for malpractice?

23:41.008 --> 23:43.242
He put you up to this, didn't he?

23:43.310 --> 23:46.279
I don't like him any more than you do, Dawn.

23:46.347 --> 23:48.914
But he's right, and you know it.

23:51.084 --> 23:53.118
[both sigh]

23:54.754 --> 23:56.689
What's going on? Why didn't you operate?

23:56.756 --> 23:58.924
There was a mistake.
I'll find out what I can.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.259
- Mistake? What does that even mean?
- Right now,

24:01.327 --> 24:03.996
we need to get your mom back to
her room so that she can rest.

24:04.063 --> 24:05.477
Well, what about the heart?
Did somebody else get it?

24:05.527 --> 24:07.531
I really couldn't say.

24:09.402 --> 24:12.471
Yeah, you don't have to.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.772
- Giselle, don't.
- You took it, didn't you?

24:14.840 --> 24:16.108
Yes, I did.

24:16.175 --> 24:17.942
- I hope you die in there.
- Giselle!

24:18.011 --> 24:18.943
Aah!

24:19.012 --> 24:19.944
Alex.

24:20.013 --> 24:22.547
[breathing deeply]

24:32.357 --> 24:34.125
Are you feeling that?

24:34.159 --> 24:36.628
[sighs] Yeah, sort of.

24:36.695 --> 24:38.295
[sighs]

24:38.363 --> 24:40.631
You're losing circulation here.

24:40.665 --> 24:43.134
Overcranking the devices,

24:43.201 --> 24:45.836
you've dangerously extended
the popliteal artery.

24:45.904 --> 24:47.505
- So I'll slow down.
- I'm taking them off.

24:47.572 --> 24:50.174
- No. I will not... I'm not gonna let you.
- If you have gangrene,

24:50.208 --> 24:52.609
you're not even gonna have legs
left to lengthen, man.

24:52.644 --> 24:54.211
Why is this so important to you?

24:54.279 --> 24:55.879
I need to be 5'4".

24:55.947 --> 24:57.614
Why do you need to be 5'4"?

24:57.649 --> 25:00.216
The way the jets are built, if I'm too short,
I can't even reach the pedals.

25:00.251 --> 25:03.053
- Why are we suddenly talking about jets?
- The air force, all right?

25:03.120 --> 25:04.855
It's the family business, until me.

25:04.889 --> 25:06.924
If you compromise the blood flow
to your lower legs,

25:06.958 --> 25:08.391
it means that you might lose them.

25:08.426 --> 25:09.726
Do you understand that?

25:09.761 --> 25:11.194
Do you understand that I've had these on

25:11.262 --> 25:12.595
for over... what?... Six months now, okay?

25:12.629 --> 25:13.963
It can't all be for nothing.

25:13.997 --> 25:15.560
I've been doing this for
a lot longer than six months.

25:15.648 --> 25:16.599
Let me tell you something, Donny.

25:16.670 --> 25:18.976
This situation here is very, very dangerous.

25:19.044 --> 25:19.846
Of course you wouldn't understand.

25:19.896 --> 25:22.338
Look at you, huh? Look at you.

25:22.373 --> 25:23.462
When have you had a problem measuring up?

25:23.519 --> 25:25.741
You know, actually, Donny,
I'm kind of a train wreck.

25:35.418 --> 25:37.553
[sighs]

25:37.588 --> 25:40.556
Listen, man. I actually really
admire your dedication to this.

25:40.591 --> 25:43.225
I do. [sighs]

25:43.259 --> 25:46.495
I need to fix the malunion.

25:46.529 --> 25:48.945
So, if there's a way that
I can safely leave the monorails in there,

25:48.995 --> 25:54.536
as much as I despise
the idea of that, then...

25:54.571 --> 25:56.505
That's what I'll do.

25:57.661 --> 25:59.341
Dr. Goran, thank you.

25:59.375 --> 26:01.410
Don't thank me yet.

26:01.444 --> 26:03.712
I'll take an ultrasound
to make sure everything's okay.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.379
Did you hit your head at all?

26:05.447 --> 26:07.616
No, no. It's... it's fine.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.418
And I'm sure the baby's fine. It's just...

26:10.486 --> 26:12.087
This is so complicated.

26:12.121 --> 26:14.022
What's "this," Alex?

26:14.090 --> 26:16.891
Rounds, surgery, studying,
being pregnant alone.

26:16.926 --> 26:18.892
You're not alone, not here.

26:18.927 --> 26:19.960
Okay.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.162
But if it's this hard now,

26:21.196 --> 26:22.763
what's it gonna be like
when I have a newborn?

26:22.797 --> 26:25.433
Well, you're not the first
doctor to have a baby.

26:25.467 --> 26:26.734
Right.

26:26.801 --> 26:29.270
Okay, well, about the paternity test...

26:29.304 --> 26:30.771
I don't want to take any chances.

26:30.805 --> 26:31.972
I don't want to do it.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.341
It's your call.

26:33.408 --> 26:35.609
You stick to your guns
no matter what anyone else says.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.112
Lay back.

26:40.081 --> 26:41.815
[P.A. beeps]

26:41.850 --> 26:43.150
Woman: <i>Code blue. 7 north. 2-3.</i>

26:43.184 --> 26:44.251
[P.A. beeps]

26:44.318 --> 26:46.920
Role reversal.

26:46.988 --> 26:49.056
[scoffs] This is ridiculous.

26:49.124 --> 26:50.924
Just treat me as you'd like to be treated.

26:50.992 --> 26:52.206
You're free to go.

26:52.267 --> 26:55.128
It's too bad this wrist issue
that brought me here

26:55.196 --> 26:57.164
will continue to cause me chronic anxiety.

26:57.198 --> 27:00.133
[sighs] Fine.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.370
[sighs] Tell me what your problem is.

27:03.404 --> 27:04.804
I just did.

27:04.838 --> 27:06.273
No, that was <i>my</i> problem.

27:06.340 --> 27:07.940
Tell me what <i>yours</i> is, smart ass.

27:10.577 --> 27:14.346
Well, I've been
under a lot of stress lately.

27:14.414 --> 27:15.614
I haven't been sleeping.

27:15.683 --> 27:18.317
Well, drink some liquor and go to bed.

27:18.385 --> 27:21.988
Actually, alcohol <i>deteriorates</i>
<i>the quality of your sleep.</i>

27:22.056 --> 27:24.623
Now you're just being negative.

27:24.691 --> 27:26.792
Why are you so stressed?

27:26.859 --> 27:27.926
[inhales deeply]

27:27.994 --> 27:29.395
I don't really want to talk about it.

27:29.462 --> 27:31.397
No, Maggie, this is good.

27:31.431 --> 27:34.166
If you want her to open up to
you, you should open up to her.

27:34.234 --> 27:35.967
Thank you, Dr. Dey.

27:36.002 --> 27:38.136
No fun being interrogated, is it?

27:38.205 --> 27:40.972
No one was interrogating you, Helen.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.274
Maybe you should take a look at my wrist.

27:43.342 --> 27:47.112
What if I find something fatal under there?

27:47.180 --> 27:50.448
You think what Dr. Lin has is fatal?

27:50.516 --> 27:52.383
You said you worked on a farm.

27:52.451 --> 27:55.220
You're outside a lot. Could be skin cancer.

27:55.287 --> 27:56.888
Do you think you have skin cancer?

27:56.956 --> 27:58.856
We're not talking about me.

27:58.924 --> 28:00.091
Sorry.

28:00.125 --> 28:01.959
If I thought I had something that serious,

28:02.027 --> 28:05.129
I'd want to treat it right away.

28:05.197 --> 28:06.631
Helen, let me take a look.

28:06.665 --> 28:08.866
[sighs] I don't want to die.

Dr. Lin...

28:23.481 --> 28:26.217
is this gonna kill me?

28:29.020 --> 28:30.487
Hey, uh, is it true

28:30.555 --> 28:32.822
that this patient pretty much
blackmailed the hospital

28:32.857 --> 28:34.691
into taking someone else's donor heart?

28:36.193 --> 28:39.162
Elliot Stout is a patient
just like any other.

28:39.196 --> 28:40.731
Whatever we think of him personally,

28:40.765 --> 28:42.399
we will give him our best.

28:42.433 --> 28:45.068
Absolutely, Dr. Bell.

28:45.102 --> 28:46.470
Good.

28:51.135 --> 28:52.208
Okay.

28:59.116 --> 29:01.082
[monitors beeping]

29:01.117 --> 29:03.251
Mind if I take a closer look?

29:03.285 --> 29:04.686
Be my guest.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.721
So, are you aware

29:06.755 --> 29:09.181
that people are placing bets
on which of us is the father?

29:09.231 --> 29:11.692
Nope. But, somehow, I'm not surprised.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.397
So, there's not enough
viable regenerate here

29:15.431 --> 29:16.631
where the bones are distracted.

29:16.665 --> 29:18.699
Yeah, if you put in an intramedullary nail,

29:18.734 --> 29:20.701
it'll shorten the tibia.

29:20.736 --> 29:22.436
You'll have to do both legs.

29:22.504 --> 29:24.238
Then he'll be back to his original height.

29:24.272 --> 29:26.240
Well, at least he'll be
able to walk normally.

29:26.274 --> 29:28.543
We can't always have what we want.

29:28.577 --> 29:30.344
No, I guess we can't.

29:30.412 --> 29:33.014
You want me to, uh, scrub in
and help you get this done?

29:33.081 --> 29:35.182
- That would be great.
- Cool.

29:35.250 --> 29:38.519

All good on my end.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.781
All right, this is
what we've been waiting for.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.617
As I remove the heart, I will leave

30:11.685 --> 30:15.788

all major blood vessels intact.

30:17.991 --> 30:21.260
I have no idea how this is gonna work.

30:21.328 --> 30:24.463
We're gonna hammer in the nail
and fix the leg.

30:24.497 --> 30:27.132
That's not what I was talking about, mate.

30:27.166 --> 30:31.103
Yeah, it's a bit of unchartered territory.

30:34.007 --> 30:36.108
You'll notice, on the donor heart,

30:36.175 --> 30:39.777
that they also left artery to work with.

30:39.812 --> 30:41.779
Rian: Now, you connect the SVC last?

30:41.814 --> 30:45.150
That's right.

30:45.218 --> 30:48.086
Okay. Here it is.

30:50.123 --> 30:54.326

in there to take out.

She doesn't have to re-scrub.

but it was small.

31:59.256 --> 32:01.824
Tell me the truth. Is it gonna kill me?

32:01.858 --> 32:05.494
It's not a tumor. It's a ganglion cyst.

32:05.528 --> 32:07.997
It's a buildup of fluid around the joint,

32:08.031 --> 32:10.166
almost always <i>harmless.</i>

32:10.200 --> 32:13.468

32:58.813 --> 33:00.013
for getting rid of them.

- Nothing.

the anti-rejection drugs work,

41:48.622 --> 41:49.855
he should fully recover.

41:52.026 --> 41:54.460
Lana, I am...

41:54.528 --> 41:58.831
I told you, Dr. Bell, it doesn't matter.

41:58.865 --> 42:01.801
It doesn't matter because... I quit.

42:01.835 --> 42:03.702
What?

42:03.737 --> 42:05.504
What... what are you talking...

42:05.572 --> 42:07.172
I have been struggling for a long time,

42:07.240 --> 42:09.007
and you all know it.

42:09.075 --> 42:12.110
You've been trying to help,
but I'm holding you back.

42:12.145 --> 42:13.512
It has been a long day.

42:13.547 --> 42:15.881
I think that everyone needs to just...

42:15.916 --> 42:17.715
It's not because of you, Dr. Bell.

42:17.783 --> 42:20.252
I am just not cut out for this.

42:20.286 --> 42:23.721
So I'm not taking the board exam.

42:23.789 --> 42:24.823
I'm done.

42:26.392 --> 42:28.994
[voice breaking]
Uh, but, for what it's worth,

42:29.062 --> 42:33.097
you guys... are gonna be great.

42:45.010 --> 42:47.779
This is not important right now.

42:47.813 --> 42:50.114
Let's all go home.

42:50.182 --> 42:52.049
Tomorrow will be better.

43:02.426 --> 43:04.660
[breathes deeply]
