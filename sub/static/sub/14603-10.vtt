Before there was sex,
<i>before there was the city,</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:06.471
<i>there was just me... Carrie.
Carrie Bradshaw.</i>

00:06.474 --> 00:09.058
<i>And lots of things were changing...</i>

00:09.060 --> 00:10.961
<i>For all of us.</i>
I'm here for you, Carrie.

00:10.962 --> 00:14.898
I know. Just, all I can think
in my head is, "for how long""

00:14.899 --> 00:16.149
I know I don't say it
as much as you do,

00:16.149 --> 00:17.726
but I'm kinda terrified, too.

00:18.902 --> 00:21.370
I'm number two
behind that idiot jock west.

00:21.372 --> 00:22.989
Wave good-bye to Princeton
and Harvard,

00:22.990 --> 00:24.240
because those are mine.

00:24.242 --> 00:25.809
Looks like you were
still having fun

00:25.810 --> 00:27.043
even without Walt here.

00:27.044 --> 00:28.261
That's someone
who works for my dad.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.479
And is part of his job description

00:29.480 --> 00:30.913
screwing his boss' daughter?

00:30.915 --> 00:33.582
<i>We</i> don't exist anymore.
Now you're my boyfriend.

00:33.584 --> 00:36.002
I won't say anything, Walt,
I promise,

00:36.003 --> 00:37.245
but are you gay?

00:37.411 --> 00:39.272
I don't know what I am.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.257
I've had a change of heart
about Manhattan

00:41.259 --> 00:42.425
and "Interview" magazine.

00:42.426 --> 00:44.211
I want you to pursue your dreams.

00:46.848 --> 00:49.065
<i>I had tried to run.
I had tried to hide,</i>

00:49.066 --> 00:53.403
<i>but finally I had to accept
all roads led to Sebastian...</i>

00:53.404 --> 00:56.106
<i>Or, to be more precise,
to Sebastian's lips.</i>

00:56.107 --> 00:59.392
Aw.
You guys are the cutest.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.944
Aren't they the cutest?

01:00.945 --> 01:03.580
No, no, no.
Don't stop on my account.

01:03.581 --> 01:05.949
Okay, we won't.
Don't you dare.

01:05.950 --> 01:07.400
Oh, now you've done it.

Kissing Sebastian was so good,
<i>I thought I'd never get enough.</i>

01:21.132 --> 01:22.248
<i>But it turned out
I had gotten too much.</i>

01:22.249 --> 01:24.250

01:24.251 --> 01:25.552
Oh.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.803
Beard burn.

01:26.804 --> 01:28.805
That's what you get
from marathon make-out sessions.

01:28.806 --> 01:30.005
Should I put something on it?

01:30.007 --> 01:32.976
Hair of the dog. With Walt,
I just got used to it.

01:32.977 --> 01:34.027
Of course, now I have to
get used to Walt

01:34.028 --> 01:35.478
never talking to me again.

01:35.479 --> 01:37.530
You can't keep avoiding Walt.
Yes, I can.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.415
Maybe it won't be so bad
now that he and Donna broke up.

01:39.417 --> 01:42.434
Thank God I don't have
to see that anymore.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.121
Ugh. There are some things
I can never un-see.

01:45.122 --> 01:46.423
I know we're never
getting back together.

01:46.424 --> 01:48.290
I just wish things could be
the way they used to be,

01:48.292 --> 01:50.794
- the four of us, that we could be friends.
- You know what?

01:50.795 --> 01:52.913
I want that, too, for my birthday.

01:52.914 --> 01:55.280
That's on Friday. I can't fix
things with Walt by Friday.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.334
Just try. Talk to him.
It won't be the same

01:57.335 --> 01:59.285
if I can't spend my birthday
with all of you.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.171
You're forgetting that
you have a mega-hot boyfriend.

02:01.172 --> 02:03.006
That is who you should be
spending your birthday with.

02:03.007 --> 02:04.873
Well, yes, he's invited, too.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.142
And why not?

02:06.143 --> 02:07.761
You and Sebastian
are so gonna have sex.

02:07.762 --> 02:09.895
Bye-bye, virginity.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.181
It's my birthday.
I don't give gifts. I get them.

02:12.183 --> 02:14.133
And I just wanna keep it small
this year,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.186
you know, and spend it
with the people I love.

02:16.187 --> 02:17.803
I really need you guys...

02:17.805 --> 02:20.323
And cupcakes.
Got to have cupcakes.

02:20.324 --> 02:22.241
You're smart not to have sex.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.477
My relationship with Seth
ruined everything for me.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.729
Ah, here we go again.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.914
"The b+ that destroyed my life""
starring mouse.

02:27.915 --> 02:31.300
It did. I'm no longer number one
in the class.

02:31.302 --> 02:33.703
I may not achieve my lifelong
dream of going to Harvard.

02:33.704 --> 02:35.205
I'm pretty sure
that's your parents' dream.

02:35.206 --> 02:37.090
Well, they drummed it into my head

02:37.091 --> 02:39.960
for 16 years, so now I can't
tell the difference.

02:39.961 --> 02:42.328
Harvard isn't the only school.
Yes, it is.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.630
I've been riding this train

02:43.631 --> 02:45.348
since the first day
of kindergarten.

02:45.349 --> 02:46.766
I can't get off now.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.434
Sure, you can.
Tuck and roll.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.803
I'm meeting this woman
from Castlebury

02:49.804 --> 02:51.004
who went to Harvard.

02:51.005 --> 02:54.189
Where I stand now,
I'm going to need connections.

02:54.191 --> 02:56.142
I'm sure you'll charm
the pants off her.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.011
Well, that would only really
work if she was a lesbian.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.678
Is she a lesbian?
She's from Harvard.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.449
- She can be anything she wants to be.
- Well, you'll be great, mouse.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.452
And then she'll write me
a glowing recommendation.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.821
- Right?
- Yes.

03:07.822 --> 03:10.490
I can get Walt to forgive me
for cheating on him, right?

03:10.491 --> 03:13.960
Yes. It's my birthday, and I say
everyone will get their wish.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.512
What's yours?

03:15.513 --> 03:18.465
Hmm. You know, I'm good.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.083
I've got you guys...

03:20.084 --> 03:21.967
Sebastian...

03:21.969 --> 03:23.136
"Interview."

03:23.137 --> 03:25.672
So you have everything you want?

03:25.673 --> 03:28.925
Am I allowed to hate you
<i>just a little?</i>

03:28.926 --> 03:31.044
Yeah, a little bit.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.380
Let me try this again.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.675
♪ our way around indecision

03:36.841 --> 03:38.927
ahem.

03:40.487 --> 03:44.324
Listen, I don't know
if you girls have noticed.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.209
I've been going
through a tough time lately.

03:46.210 --> 03:48.161
Yeah, because it's hard
to see Sebastian

03:48.162 --> 03:49.412
with that bitch Carrie Bradshaw.

03:49.413 --> 03:51.031
What? No.

03:51.032 --> 03:52.565
Because things didn't
work out with Walt.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.000
No. I can always get another guy.

03:54.001 --> 03:57.337
What I can't get is this purse.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.322
The coach leather duffle bag
in red.

03:59.874 --> 04:01.458
It's beautiful.
It's so you.

04:01.459 --> 04:03.409
It is, and it's already sold out.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.245
But I know I can count
on you two to find me one.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.297
How?

04:08.299 --> 04:10.583
That's your problem.
I can't do <i>everything.</i>

04:10.584 --> 04:12.852
Because, hello, <i>this...</i>

04:12.853 --> 04:13.962
Is a full-time job.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.755
Now get to it.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.027
You like Pascal's triangle?

04:21.028 --> 04:23.313
I <i>love</i> Pascal's triangle.

04:23.314 --> 04:25.932
Especially the rows
with the catalan numbers.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.117
Oh, my God.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.737
I got a shiver just now
when you said that.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.274
Stacy, it's so great to meet you.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.793
Mouse, I wish I had a friend
like you

04:36.794 --> 04:37.961
when I was at Castlebury...

04:37.962 --> 04:40.447
Or even <i>one</i> friend
when I was at Castlebury.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.999
<i>Mouse was having
the greatest date of her life</i>

04:43.000 --> 04:45.051
<i>with a future version of herself...</i>

04:45.052 --> 04:47.286
<i>One that had a degree from Harvard.</i>

04:47.287 --> 04:48.454
Can I show you one last thing?

04:48.455 --> 04:49.639
You really don't have to.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.624
I definitely feel like I know you.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.209
My debate trophy.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.911
East coast speech and debate
invitational.

04:54.912 --> 04:56.096
First place.

04:56.097 --> 04:57.897
You kind of have to
bend down to see it.

04:57.898 --> 05:01.551
Of course, they give all
the best spots to the jocks.

05:01.717 --> 05:04.804
Who's Thomas west?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.288
His name is on, like, every trophy.

05:06.290 --> 05:07.941
Ah, just your run-of-the-mill jock.

05:07.942 --> 05:10.642
Oh, now that's cold.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.079
I'm Thomas west.
Most people just call me "west""

05:13.080 --> 05:14.446
Stacy ling.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.366
<i>Mouse realized she had taken
a wrong turn</i>

05:16.367 --> 05:17.867
<i>when she steered
her Harvard connection</i>

05:17.868 --> 05:19.419
<i>over to the trophy case,</i>

05:19.420 --> 05:22.288
<i>but by then,
it was too late to back up.</i>

05:22.289 --> 05:23.656
What brings you to Castlebury?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.874
Oh, mouse invited me to visit
because I used to go here,

05:25.876 --> 05:28.595
before I went to college...
In Cambridge.

05:28.596 --> 05:31.097
You mean Harvard?
Sounds so braggy.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.882
You got game. You might
as well brag about it.

05:32.883 --> 05:34.300
I guess.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.769
And that's where
you wanna go, isn't it?

05:35.770 --> 05:36.886
Yes.

05:36.887 --> 05:38.671
Mouse is an excellent candidate...

05:38.672 --> 05:40.273
Number two in the class.

05:40.274 --> 05:43.026
Number two?
I assumed you were number one.

05:43.027 --> 05:45.136
I'm number one,
unless something's changed.

05:45.302 --> 05:46.896
Has anything changed?

05:46.897 --> 05:48.197
No.

05:48.199 --> 05:50.450
You're an athlete <i>and</i> a scholar?

05:50.451 --> 05:51.785
We should talk.
We should.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.870
I'm also very interested
in... Cambridge.

05:54.872 --> 05:57.624
Are you free this
Friday night? It's spirit night.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.876
And watch
a bunch of jocks get hammered

05:59.877 --> 06:02.829
and make asses of themselves?
No, thank you.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.881
Sounds like fun.
I'd love to go.

06:04.882 --> 06:06.741
Me, too. Never miss it.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.641
Hey!

06:14.642 --> 06:16.375
Hey.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.261
Oh, you probably
don't wanna talk to me.

06:18.262 --> 06:21.848
No. Actually, I do.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.550
I've <i>been</i> wanting to talk.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.853
Well, if it's to say
how much you hate me, go ahead.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.655
I deserve it.
Maggie, I don't hate you.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.573
Walt, don't be a w.A.S.P.
About this.

06:30.574 --> 06:32.558
Come on. Let it out.

06:34.411 --> 06:37.780
I was angry and hurt...

06:37.781 --> 06:39.858
But mostly confused.

06:41.417 --> 06:43.653
You were always saying
how much you loved me.

06:43.819 --> 06:45.705
I do. I-I did.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.341
I don't know why I did it.

06:48.342 --> 06:49.742
I do.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.262
I've thought about it a lot,

06:52.263 --> 06:56.632
and I think it's because you
weren't feeling loved by me,

06:56.634 --> 06:59.185
not the way you wanna be loved.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.437
I mean, that's not an excuse.

07:01.438 --> 07:04.439
Maggie, it wasn't all your fault.

07:04.441 --> 07:07.477
I wasn't a very good boyfriend.

07:07.478 --> 07:11.146
So it's not just
about <i>me</i> forgiving you.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.485
This conversation is not at all
going the way I expected.

07:15.486 --> 07:17.403
<i>Suddenly, for Maggie,</i>

07:17.404 --> 07:20.315
<i>there was a light
at the end of the tunnel...</i>

07:20.481 --> 07:23.409
<i>While Dorrit was enjoying
the solitude in her cave.</i>

07:29.283 --> 07:31.801
You could knock!

07:33.587 --> 07:35.138
I could set myself
on fire,

07:35.139 --> 07:36.589
and I'm not sure you'd notice.

07:38.342 --> 07:40.560
What do you want?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.529
Just to remind you that it's
Carrie's birthday on Friday.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.679
What?

07:43.681 --> 07:45.899
I'm sorry. I stopped
listening at "Carrie""

07:45.900 --> 07:50.436
well, birthdays were
mainly your mom's department,

07:50.437 --> 07:51.804
and Carrie did most
of the heavy lifting

07:51.805 --> 07:53.072
when you turned 15.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.024
She got me a sheet cake.

07:55.025 --> 07:56.109
And a bunch of records
that you wanted,

07:56.110 --> 07:57.810
and those headphones.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.363
What do I have to do?

08:00.364 --> 08:02.115
Well, she's making plans
with her friends,

08:02.116 --> 08:03.449
but I wanna do <i>something.</i>

08:03.450 --> 08:05.034
You know, at least we should
get her a present.

08:05.035 --> 08:06.786
We could both get her something.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.087
Like what?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.005
I'm giving her a credit card.

08:10.007 --> 08:11.824
You're giving her a credit card?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.042
I never know what to get you girls.

08:13.043 --> 08:14.794
And this way, she can go
and get herself something...

08:14.795 --> 08:16.595
She's dating the guy
you told her not to.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.131
She lies to you
about where she's going

08:18.132 --> 08:19.382
and who she's with.

08:19.383 --> 08:20.717
If you think about it,

08:20.718 --> 08:23.101
I'm actually the more
reliable daughter.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.943
- Where's my credit card?
- When you turn 17,

08:24.944 --> 08:26.606
I will get you a credit card, okay?

08:26.607 --> 08:28.441
I'd like that in writing.

08:28.442 --> 08:31.444
Let's talk about
what you're getting her.

08:31.445 --> 08:32.895
Can't really afford much.

08:32.895 --> 08:34.864
Maybe if I had a credit card...

08:34.865 --> 08:36.032
Okay, I get it.
Here.

08:36.033 --> 08:38.284
Just... get her an album
or something, you know?

08:38.284 --> 08:39.811
The kind of music that she likes,

08:39.977 --> 08:42.871
not, uh, not this stuff.

08:42.873 --> 08:45.074
And don't tell her
about the credit card.

08:45.075 --> 08:46.459
I want it to be a surprise.

08:46.460 --> 08:49.028
Even if I did tell her,
she wouldn't believe me.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.465
At least now I know
it's a good present.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:02.475 --> 09:04.726
God, I love this bag.

09:04.728 --> 09:07.096
Um...

09:07.097 --> 09:09.399
You know the rules.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.516
No one goes through the loot

09:10.517 --> 09:13.319
until <i>I've</i> had a chance
to look at it.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.272
Oh! The coach stuff.
Oh, Gorgina!

09:16.273 --> 09:17.939
If you ever feel like
being generous...

09:17.941 --> 09:21.060
Well, maybe I will, but not
with someone who clearly

09:21.061 --> 09:22.495
doesn't <i>think</i> I'm generous.

09:22.496 --> 09:23.780
How's the guest list for Friday?

09:23.781 --> 09:25.832
Perfection. The book party
for "less than zero"

09:25.833 --> 09:27.000
will be amazing.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.835
I added two drag queens
and a train wreck.

09:28.836 --> 09:29.869
Mm?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.120
- Carrie?
- Oh.

09:31.121 --> 09:34.590
Liz Smith calls it <i>the</i> literary
event of the year.

09:34.591 --> 09:37.010
And we are in the book.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.461
"Interview."

09:38.462 --> 09:40.746
We're the magazine of choice
for soulless college dropouts.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.931
Yay.

09:41.932 --> 09:43.416
Carrie, you're working the doors.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.051
You get here early on Friday.
Oh, I can't come to the party.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.302
Oh, don't be silly.
Of course you can.

09:46.303 --> 09:48.971
- You work for me.
- No, I mean I have other plans.

09:48.972 --> 09:51.423
You said so yourself. It's
the literary event of the year.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.192
Actually, Liz Smith said that.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.593
It's a big deal, Carrie.
What do you have that's bigger?

09:55.595 --> 09:59.399
<i>I wanted to tell her
the truth... my birthday.</i>

09:59.400 --> 10:01.391
Nothing.

10:08.382 --> 10:09.633
Yeah, sure, I'd love
to go to the party.

10:09.634 --> 10:12.251
The guy who wrote the book...
That Easton Ellis kid...

10:12.252 --> 10:13.386
I went to boarding school
with a bunch of the people

10:13.387 --> 10:14.804
he wrote about.

10:14.805 --> 10:17.524
We were all getting thrown out
about the same time.

10:17.525 --> 10:19.359
But what really matters is I get
to be with you on your birthday.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.279
Well, Larissa doesn't even know
it's my birthday, so...

10:22.280 --> 10:25.198
Don't worry. I'll sing "happy
birthday" to you very quietly.

10:25.199 --> 10:27.317
I'm not sure anyone will hear it
anyway over by the door.

10:27.318 --> 10:30.170
I'm just relieved she said "ye""
to the coat check girl

10:30.171 --> 10:31.438
bringing a plus one.

10:31.439 --> 10:34.456
A lot of very interesting things
happen by the coat check.

10:34.458 --> 10:35.891
That's all I'm saying. Besides,
I get to be with you

10:35.893 --> 10:38.077
on your big night.
It's all I care about.

10:38.079 --> 10:41.798
What a coincidence.
That's all I care about, too.

10:41.799 --> 10:43.300
You tried everything?

10:43.301 --> 10:44.751
Obviously,
you didn't try everything,

10:44.752 --> 10:47.897
'cause if you tried everything,
I would have the bag.

10:50.289 --> 10:53.559
For instance, did you try this?

10:54.794 --> 10:56.812
Hey, Carrie!

10:56.814 --> 10:59.149
I hope I'm not interrupting.

10:59.150 --> 11:01.101
Not that I really care.

11:01.102 --> 11:02.351
Always honest.

11:02.353 --> 11:04.404
Yeah, one of my many
great qualities.

11:04.405 --> 11:06.239
You work at "Interview," right?

11:06.240 --> 11:07.406
Yeah.

11:07.408 --> 11:09.692
The magazine must get sent
a lot of cool stuff,

11:09.694 --> 11:12.995
like purses and things?
Totally.

11:12.997 --> 11:15.497
Have you seen
the new coach duffle bag in red?

11:15.499 --> 11:18.668
Yes, we just got it.
It's amazing.

11:18.669 --> 11:20.419
I know! And I love it.

11:20.421 --> 11:22.838
So why don't you just go out
to the mall and buy it?

11:22.840 --> 11:26.026
They're all sold out.
Everyone wants one.

11:26.027 --> 11:28.795
Donna, don't even ask.
What? She owes me.

11:28.796 --> 11:30.130
For what?

11:30.131 --> 11:33.717
You. I-I gave her you.

11:33.718 --> 11:35.602
No. No, you didn't.

11:35.603 --> 11:37.503
Well, that's how I see it.

11:37.504 --> 11:40.522
I would pay you for it.
Name your price.

11:40.524 --> 11:42.702
Give it a rest, Donna.
Not gonna happen.

11:44.444 --> 11:45.979
Thank you.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.230
Getting me away from Donna...

11:47.231 --> 11:49.182
Best early birthday present ever.

11:49.183 --> 11:51.233
Carrie,
about your birthday...

11:51.235 --> 11:52.968
Oh, please don't be mad.
It turns out

11:52.970 --> 11:54.453
I have to work Friday night,
so we can't have

11:54.455 --> 11:56.521
my little birthday party.
Oh, thank God.

11:56.523 --> 11:58.541
What? I think
you're supposed to say,

11:58.542 --> 12:00.358
"oh, I'm sorry to hear that""

12:00.360 --> 12:02.661
I have to go to spirit night
on Friday

12:02.663 --> 12:05.631
with that woman I met
who went to Harvard... and west.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.384
Mm, well, that could be...
Potentially horrible.

12:08.386 --> 12:10.719
So you're not doing anything
to celebrate?

12:10.721 --> 12:12.422
- Mm.
- Of all people,

12:12.423 --> 12:15.508
that narcissist Larissa
should understand a birthday.

12:15.509 --> 12:16.760
It's your day.

12:16.761 --> 12:19.562
- I didn't actually tell her.
- Why?

12:19.563 --> 12:21.815
Well, because she's my boss,

12:21.816 --> 12:23.049
and I couldn just say,

12:23.050 --> 12:25.985
"I'm 17, and I care
about my birthday cupcake""

12:25.986 --> 12:27.887
Ah, it might be better.

12:27.888 --> 12:29.388
I get to go to cool party.

12:29.389 --> 12:30.606
Where you'll be checking coats.

12:30.608 --> 12:32.492
While hanging
with my adorable boyfriend.

12:32.493 --> 12:34.494
You know, kinda have it all.

12:34.495 --> 12:36.079
Minus you two, of course.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.414
And Walt.

12:37.415 --> 12:39.064
You two made up?

12:39.066 --> 12:41.601
Better than that. I think
he wants to get back together.

12:41.602 --> 12:44.037
Wow. Well, for the first time
in my life,

12:44.038 --> 12:47.040
I am going to use
"flabbergasted" in a sentence.

12:47.041 --> 12:49.091
I am flabbergasted.

12:49.093 --> 12:52.245
You should have heard him.
He practically apologized to me.

12:52.246 --> 12:53.262
Clearly, he misses me.

12:53.264 --> 12:56.882
I officially join
your flabbergastation.

12:56.884 --> 12:59.352
Yeah. I-I'm sure he does
miss you, sweetie,

12:59.353 --> 13:00.936
and you're awesome.

13:00.938 --> 13:04.057
But maybe just don't rush anything.

13:04.058 --> 13:05.558
Who, me? Rush?

13:07.061 --> 13:09.946
Oh. There he is.

13:09.947 --> 13:11.874
How do I look?
You look great.

13:13.399 --> 13:15.601
Am I still welcome at this table?

13:15.602 --> 13:16.879
Shut up. Of course you are.

13:18.488 --> 13:20.790
Ahh.
It's good to be back.

13:20.791 --> 13:24.043
Yeah. Now we have a chance
to... ketchup.

13:24.044 --> 13:26.245
Still making terrible puns.

13:26.722 --> 13:27.997
You <i>butter</i> believe it.

13:27.998 --> 13:29.615
Is it horrible
that I'm relieved

13:29.616 --> 13:32.301
that I don't have to pretend
those puns are funny anymore?

13:32.303 --> 13:33.752
What do you mean, pretend?

13:33.754 --> 13:35.755
Well, when we were dating,
I felt like we had to...

13:35.756 --> 13:37.422
You know, laugh.

13:37.424 --> 13:39.861
But now that we're just friends...

13:40.027 --> 13:41.794
<i>While Maggie was wondering
what road</i>

13:41.795 --> 13:43.095
<i>she and Walt were on...</i>

13:45.599 --> 13:47.767
<i>Dorrit felt like she
was on the highway to hell...</i>

13:47.768 --> 13:48.901
Thank you.

13:48.903 --> 13:50.653
<i>Of top 40 music...</i>

13:56.777 --> 13:59.328
<i>until she found something
her own speed.</i>

14:03.483 --> 14:05.618
<i>♪ I want it
now, now, now, now ♪</i>

14:05.619 --> 14:06.920
need any help?

14:06.921 --> 14:08.922
Nope. All good.

14:08.923 --> 14:10.990
Just getting this.

14:10.991 --> 14:12.592
Phil Collins.

14:12.593 --> 14:14.626
Quite a stud, huh?

14:14.628 --> 14:16.879
- It's not for me. I hate this crap.
- Yeah?

14:16.881 --> 14:19.365
Well, I think we might have
some stuff you'll like

14:19.366 --> 14:21.000
in the back of the store.

14:21.001 --> 14:22.835
Like a bootleg?

14:22.836 --> 14:24.102
Better.

14:24.104 --> 14:26.355
Come on. I'll show you.

14:26.357 --> 14:28.858
What is it?

14:28.859 --> 14:30.726
<i>♪ I want it now, now,
now, now ♪</i>

14:34.532 --> 14:36.348
Hey! What's going on?!

14:36.350 --> 14:38.401
That's what we do with shoplifters.

14:38.402 --> 14:40.503
What are you gonna do?
You can't just lock me in here!

14:40.504 --> 14:43.405
I'm not.
I'm gonna call the police,

14:43.407 --> 14:44.407
have you arrested.

14:44.408 --> 14:45.908
What?!

14:45.910 --> 14:48.043
No, I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again!

14:48.045 --> 14:49.362
Please don't call the police!

14:49.363 --> 14:51.581
<i>Dorrit was realizing
her path in life</i>

14:51.582 --> 14:53.049
could leave her with a record,

14:53.050 --> 14:56.335
<i>and not the kind
she could buy at the store.</i>

15:02.208 --> 15:04.043
Are the police here?

15:04.044 --> 15:05.394
Didn't call them.

15:05.396 --> 15:09.232
What? Are you serious?

15:10.550 --> 15:11.900
So why'd you lock me up?

15:11.902 --> 15:13.353
Just to torture me?

15:13.354 --> 15:14.654
To teach you a lesson.

15:14.655 --> 15:16.371
You're sick!

15:16.373 --> 15:17.556
At least I'm not a thief.

15:17.558 --> 15:20.059
You should be thanking me
for just scaring you.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.027
Not gonna happen.

15:22.029 --> 15:23.965
If you had stolen
anything but the dead Kennedys,

15:24.131 --> 15:25.582
I would have called the police.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.917
But I like your taste in music.

15:27.918 --> 15:31.389
Well, good for you. Bye.

15:38.428 --> 15:40.196
You still want your album?
You paid for it!

15:43.884 --> 15:46.185
I got it, dad. It's for me.

15:46.186 --> 15:47.553
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:47.554 --> 15:49.606
What's up?
Why'd you wanna see me?

15:49.607 --> 15:50.756
I always need to see you.

15:50.757 --> 15:53.142
You're so charming.

15:53.143 --> 15:54.276
My mom called.

15:54.278 --> 15:55.812
Oh.

15:55.813 --> 15:57.814
Yeah, I haven't talked
to her in a while.

15:57.815 --> 15:59.399
Are you okay?

15:59.400 --> 16:01.451
Yeah, she wants to get together.

16:01.452 --> 16:03.369
Well, that's a good thing, right?

16:03.370 --> 16:05.631
She wants to see me on Friday,
on your birthday.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.739
Oh.
Look, I told her "no."

16:07.741 --> 16:09.908
No! No, you...
You should see your mom.

16:09.910 --> 16:12.378
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:12.379 --> 16:13.546
You won't be disappointed?

16:13.547 --> 16:15.465
No, of course not.

16:15.466 --> 16:17.582
Yeah. Um, do you want
a soda or something?

16:17.584 --> 16:20.302
Yeah. That'd be great. And we'll
still celebrate your birthday.

16:20.304 --> 16:23.723
Yeah, totally. I mean,
we can do that anytime.

16:23.724 --> 16:25.307
Yeah.

16:27.010 --> 16:29.648
Anytime except my birthday.

16:40.891 --> 16:43.477
Whoa. This is where you work?

16:43.478 --> 16:46.129
I know. Sometimes I'm even
jealous of myself.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.466
Sebastian's loss is my gain.
I am totally excited.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.802
Okay.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.304
Guest list. Good.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.522
Can I see?

16:55.523 --> 16:56.772
Yeah.

16:56.774 --> 16:58.275
Is this who's coming tonight?

16:58.276 --> 16:59.659
He's that photographer.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.161
She directed that movie.

17:01.162 --> 17:03.029
He's dating Madonna.

17:03.031 --> 17:05.281
And you...
You're on the list.

17:05.282 --> 17:07.099
Can I take this home and frame it?

17:07.101 --> 17:09.819
The real celebrities
here tonight are the writers...

17:09.819 --> 17:10.921
Jay McInerney.

17:10.922 --> 17:12.756
You read "bright lights,
big city," right?

17:12.757 --> 17:14.173
Who didn't?

17:14.175 --> 17:16.659
And Tama Janowitz.
Bret Easton Ellis is only 21.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.011
All the best writers do it
when they're young,

17:19.012 --> 17:21.263
so they have something fresh
to say. Fresh is yummy.

17:21.265 --> 17:24.517
Old is, well... old.

17:24.519 --> 17:26.353
I can't believe all his stories
are about people like us.

17:26.354 --> 17:29.021
Well, with way nicer cars
and a lot more drugs.

17:29.023 --> 17:30.941
Mm, you should get to work on that.

17:30.942 --> 17:31.942
The writing or the drugs?

17:31.943 --> 17:33.225
Ideally... both.

17:33.227 --> 17:35.137
This book all started
with a journal

17:35.446 --> 17:37.390
that Bret was keeping
in High School

17:37.556 --> 17:40.117
- about him and his friends.
- That's what I write in mine.

17:40.118 --> 17:41.151
Am I in it?

17:41.152 --> 17:43.786
Oh, Larissa, you remember
my friend Walt.

17:43.788 --> 17:45.038
We met at your Halloween party.

17:45.039 --> 17:46.123
I had a Halloween party?

17:46.124 --> 17:49.126
Anyway, about your journal...

17:49.127 --> 17:50.744
You could have a best-seller
on your hands.

17:50.745 --> 17:52.162
And here is the man
that you need to meet...

17:52.163 --> 17:53.997
Tripp Ramsey.
He's Bret's publisher.

17:53.998 --> 17:56.132
He's always on the lookout
for a fresh, new voice.

17:56.134 --> 17:58.001
Well, I'll be very friendly
when I take his name at the door

17:58.002 --> 17:59.970
and hope he remembers me
five years from now.

17:59.971 --> 18:01.804
Why would you be working the door?

18:01.806 --> 18:02.889
Because you told me I had to?

18:02.890 --> 18:04.174
I did no such thing.

18:04.175 --> 18:05.758
So I'll be checking coats?

18:05.760 --> 18:07.177
Why would you do that?

18:07.178 --> 18:08.594
Because you told me I had to.

18:08.596 --> 18:10.897
Well, you make me sound
like a slave driver.

18:10.898 --> 18:12.815
If you wanna work, work the room.

18:12.817 --> 18:15.217
The guest of honor tonight
is only 5 years older than you,

18:15.219 --> 18:17.154
so you have very little time
to make it.

18:17.155 --> 18:18.571
Actually, as of today, 4.

18:18.573 --> 18:20.657
Then you better
get crackin', poppin.

18:20.658 --> 18:22.393
Time's a-wasting.
Chop, chop.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.329
You are in the mix.

18:27.331 --> 18:28.999
I mean, I knew you were in it,
but not like this.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.117
Donna kept saying

18:30.118 --> 18:31.901
you probably just made coffee
for cool people,

18:31.902 --> 18:33.202
but she is wrong.

18:33.204 --> 18:34.504
Of course she would think
so little of me.

18:34.505 --> 18:35.755
Do you know she had the nerve

18:35.756 --> 18:38.041
to ask me to get her a coach bag?

18:38.042 --> 18:39.258
She's Donna.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.410
Exactly, which is why
I have to ask...

18:41.412 --> 18:42.429
Why do you still hang out with her?

18:42.430 --> 18:43.462
It kinda freaks me out a little.

18:43.464 --> 18:46.082
Kind of freaks me out, too.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.202
I know this is hard
to believe, but Donna...

18:49.203 --> 18:50.269
I can talk to her.

18:50.271 --> 18:52.439
About what,
her outfit for tomorrow?

18:52.440 --> 18:54.691
You don't know her.

18:54.692 --> 18:56.886
She's actually
a really good listener.

18:59.563 --> 19:01.815
You should at least pretend
to be having a good time.

19:01.816 --> 19:03.817
Not until I absolutely have to.

19:05.903 --> 19:07.904
Now I absolutely have to.

19:07.905 --> 19:10.207
Stacy!

19:10.208 --> 19:11.874
I'll find you later.

19:11.876 --> 19:13.442
Where's west?
Have you seen west?

19:13.444 --> 19:15.494
I haven't seen west,
but you and I can hang.

19:15.496 --> 19:16.779
We can do the extra credit problems

19:16.780 --> 19:17.797
on the calculus chalkboard.

19:17.798 --> 19:19.583
You go ahead.
I think I should find west

19:19.584 --> 19:21.885
in case he has any questions
about Harvard.

19:21.886 --> 19:25.138
Oh, now that you mention it,
I have a question about Harvard.

19:25.139 --> 19:27.139
What do you think...
Your chances are?

19:27.141 --> 19:29.341
I wish I could say
they were good, mouse.

19:29.343 --> 19:31.595
I really do, but the hard truth is,

19:31.596 --> 19:33.013
you're just another
smart Asian girl.

19:33.014 --> 19:34.464
You don't have a hook.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.899
I thought smart Asian girl
<i>was</i> my hook.

19:36.901 --> 19:39.186
Once upon a time, it was enough.

19:39.187 --> 19:42.138
Now we're a dime a dozen.
I got in just under the wire.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.473
But this is fixable.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.643
All I need is
a Harvard-worthy hook.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.143
Let's brainstorm ideas.

19:49.363 --> 19:51.697
There's west. West!

19:51.699 --> 19:52.999
West!
Oh, hey, what's up?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.317
Good.
Let me introduce my friends.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.361
Okay.

20:01.458 --> 20:02.841
So Carrie's out tonight.

20:02.843 --> 20:05.529
I guess we'll have to give her
our presents in the morning.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.163
You did get her one, right?

20:07.164 --> 20:08.415
Yep.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.634
Need help wrapping it?

20:10.635 --> 20:12.795
No.

20:28.785 --> 20:31.321
Those were your mom's records.

20:31.322 --> 20:33.072
I know.
You're not thinking

20:33.074 --> 20:35.107
you could pass one of those off
as Carrie's gift?

20:35.109 --> 20:36.493
I bought Carrie a record.

20:36.494 --> 20:38.460
I just left it at the store.

20:38.462 --> 20:42.648
Dorrit... come on. Your lies...
Do you think I'm stupid?

20:42.650 --> 20:44.416
I'm not lying.

20:44.418 --> 20:46.086
Just get your sister a record.
I will take you.

20:46.087 --> 20:47.504
No. I'll do it.

20:47.505 --> 20:49.748
<i>Dorrit didn't like the road
she was on.</i>

20:49.914 --> 20:52.251
<i>To escape one man
who thought she was a liar,</i>

20:52.417 --> 20:55.511
<i>she had to go to one who knew
she was a thief.</i>

21:18.703 --> 21:21.338
<i>♪ won't you</i>

21:21.339 --> 21:22.622
Bennet's here.

21:22.623 --> 21:24.341
Of course he's here.
He works at "Interview""

21:24.342 --> 21:26.676
you remember him, right?
I remember.

21:26.677 --> 21:27.910
You wanna go talk to him?

21:27.911 --> 21:30.012
Uh, maybe not right now.
I need to use the bathroom.

21:30.014 --> 21:32.382
Okay, but the bathroom's
not that way.

21:32.383 --> 21:35.635
Got a book deal yet?

21:35.636 --> 21:38.722
No. I've walked by Tripp Ramsey
at least eight times

21:38.723 --> 21:39.922
looking for an opening.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.807
But it seems everyone here
wants to talk to him.

21:41.809 --> 21:45.361
Then we will just
have to bring him to <i>you.</i>

21:50.033 --> 21:53.786
Darling, I swear, I won't
breathe a word of it to anyone.

21:53.788 --> 21:55.454
A word of what?

21:55.456 --> 21:58.375
Oh, Carrie was just telling me
about the book she's writing.

21:58.376 --> 22:00.293
Oh, look, now she's upset with me.

22:00.294 --> 22:03.079
These literary wunderkinds...
So touchy.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.498
Have we met?
Tripp Ramsey.

22:05.499 --> 22:07.549
Um... Carrie Bradshaw.

22:07.551 --> 22:09.836
Uh, Tripp's a book publisher.

22:09.837 --> 22:12.164
Who specializes in wunderkinds.

22:12.330 --> 22:15.792
<i>♪ I'm not the kind
who likes to tell you ♪</i>

22:15.793 --> 22:18.144
<i>♪ just what you want me to</i>

22:18.145 --> 22:21.631
<i>♪ you're not the kind
that needs to tell me ♪</i>

22:21.632 --> 22:23.965
Bennet.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.436
Hi. Uh, you may not remember me.

22:26.437 --> 22:28.020
Walt. I remember.

22:28.022 --> 22:30.473
Can I just say how sorry I am?

22:30.474 --> 22:31.607
It's okay.

22:31.609 --> 22:33.743
It's not okay.
What I did on Halloween...

22:33.744 --> 22:34.944
I wasn't myself.

22:34.945 --> 22:36.279
Look, I had no idea

22:36.280 --> 22:38.313
you were a High School kid
from Connecticut.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.367
I would have never
put the moves on you.

22:40.368 --> 22:42.085
Totally inappropriate.

22:42.086 --> 22:44.536
Um... I called you a fag.

22:44.538 --> 22:46.155
I think I win
for most inappropriate.

22:46.156 --> 22:49.876
Yeah, not the nicest word
for what I am, but I am gay.

22:49.877 --> 22:51.427
And I don't have an issue
with that.

22:51.429 --> 22:54.012
Not that I didn't struggle with it.

22:54.014 --> 22:55.331
I mean, I spent all of High School

22:55.332 --> 22:57.100
and most of college
hoping and praying

22:57.101 --> 23:00.136
and trying so hard not to be gay.

23:00.137 --> 23:01.837
And then what happened?

23:01.839 --> 23:03.690
I kissed someone I really liked.

23:03.691 --> 23:05.909
And it wasn't a girl.
It was Marc.

23:05.910 --> 23:09.278
And he helped me realize
I'm not a freak.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.480
And now I look back
on High School and think,

23:10.481 --> 23:12.698
well, that explains
the Steve McQueen posters.

23:12.700 --> 23:14.810
<i>Walt found himself</i>

23:14.976 --> 23:17.954
<i>taking the first step
down a new, unmarked trail.</i>

23:17.955 --> 23:19.455
<i>And he wasn't the only one.</i>

23:19.457 --> 23:21.624
I guess you would call it
a coming-of-age story.

23:21.625 --> 23:23.743
My main character is a virgin,

23:23.744 --> 23:26.328
but her friends are teaching her
all about sex.

23:26.330 --> 23:29.131
It's so smart to make it
about sex. Sex sells.

23:29.133 --> 23:32.007
- What do they teach her?
- They tell her that sex is like

23:32.008 --> 23:33.303
putting a hot dog in a keyhole.

23:33.304 --> 23:34.720
A hot dog?

23:34.722 --> 23:36.756
Yeah.

23:36.757 --> 23:39.141
Cooked or uncooked?
Can I steal that for my book?

23:39.143 --> 23:41.344
- Only if I'm the one to publish it.
-  Okay.

23:41.345 --> 23:42.712
How old are you?

23:42.713 --> 23:43.929
Uh, 17.

23:43.931 --> 23:46.649
You'll be the youngest author
on my roster.

23:46.650 --> 23:48.767
Why don't we grab a drink
over here so we can talk?

23:48.769 --> 23:51.321
Just the two of us.
Yeah.

23:51.322 --> 23:54.157
Uh... definitely.

23:54.158 --> 23:56.024
Hey.

23:56.026 --> 23:58.660
- Hi there.
- You're... you're here. I'm so surprised.

23:58.662 --> 24:00.061
Good. I wanted to surprise you.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.230
Um, Sebastian, this is Tripp.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.867
Nice to meet you.

24:03.868 --> 24:05.368
Well, you seem busy.

24:05.369 --> 24:06.668
Maybe some other time.

24:06.670 --> 24:07.737
Okay.
Who was that?

24:07.738 --> 24:09.005
Am I interrupting something?

24:09.006 --> 24:10.673
No. No.

24:10.674 --> 24:14.681
I couldn't tell him the truth...
<i>That he was.</i>

24:23.461 --> 24:26.237
<i>♪ I have no heroes</i>

24:26.238 --> 24:29.156

<i>♪ don't like the stones</i>

24:35.047 --> 24:36.464
Are you still working?

24:36.465 --> 24:37.780
No, not working...

24:37.782 --> 24:39.917
Or even working <i>it,</i> apparently.

24:39.918 --> 24:41.801
All right, good.

24:41.803 --> 24:44.722
What do you say we get outta here?

24:44.723 --> 24:47.208
But... you just got here.

24:47.209 --> 24:48.809
Can we stay for a little bit?

24:48.810 --> 24:50.044
It's a really fun party.

24:50.045 --> 24:51.612
I'm not in the mood
to be around all these people.

24:51.613 --> 24:53.546
I wanna go somewhere
that's just the two of us.

24:53.548 --> 24:55.933
Yeah. Uh... okay.
Yeah, sure.

24:55.934 --> 24:59.936
Um... I'm just, uh...
I need to get my coat.

24:59.938 --> 25:02.751
So wait here, and, um,
I'll be back in two minutes.

25:02.917 --> 25:06.777

have you seen Tripp?

25:13.001 --> 25:15.119
Mm. I thought he was with you.

25:15.120 --> 25:18.655
<i>Lesson learned... when you find
your future at a party...</i>

25:18.656 --> 25:22.058
<i>Don't let it walk off without you.</i>

25:30.668 --> 25:32.836
If you were cool and interesting,

25:32.837 --> 25:34.855
and really listened to the music
you claim to like,

25:34.856 --> 25:36.673
you would have let me
steal those tapes.

25:36.674 --> 25:39.026
I am a true nihilist.

25:39.027 --> 25:40.727
You're just a terrible shoplifter.

25:40.729 --> 25:43.446
Your eyes...
They're too expressive.

25:43.448 --> 25:45.949
No, they're not.
They show everything.

25:45.951 --> 25:47.617
You need to learn
to control them better.

25:47.619 --> 25:50.037
Can I have my record back...
The one I actually bought?

25:50.038 --> 25:52.455
And I don't need you
to teach me how to shoplift.

25:54.025 --> 25:56.544
control them how?

25:56.545 --> 26:00.130
Don't do this.

26:00.132 --> 26:03.300
Also, you need to learn
to be ambidextrous.

26:03.301 --> 26:06.087
Shop with one hand...

26:06.088 --> 26:07.504
Steal with the other.

26:07.506 --> 26:09.640
And always be looking at
the hand you're shopping with.

26:09.641 --> 26:12.426
Go ahead. Try it.

26:12.427 --> 26:15.229
Is this a trap? You gonna
lock me in that room again?

26:15.230 --> 26:16.930
Ha. Nah.

26:16.932 --> 26:19.567
Even though
your eyes gave you away,

26:19.568 --> 26:20.954
they're also really pretty.

26:23.521 --> 26:24.922
Take 'em.

26:24.923 --> 26:28.242
They're yours.

26:28.243 --> 26:29.493
Are you serious?

26:29.494 --> 26:31.278
There.
You're doing it again.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.571
I thought having immigrant parents

26:40.572 --> 26:41.838
made me a shoo-in.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.842
But west has a single mother.
He even tops me there.

26:44.843 --> 26:47.428
An athlete, perfect grades...
He has every hook there is.

26:47.429 --> 26:48.962
He is Captain Hook.

26:48.964 --> 26:52.633
Does it really help you
to watch this?

26:52.634 --> 26:53.749
No.

26:53.751 --> 26:56.103
You're right.
Let's get out of here.

26:56.104 --> 26:59.223
Mouse, I need you.
You do?

26:59.224 --> 27:00.307
West was just saying someone
should round up his teammates

27:00.308 --> 27:02.892
for a yearbook photo.
Could you do that?

27:04.094 --> 27:06.197
Can I speak to you
for a second?

27:06.198 --> 27:07.531
<i>They say the road to hell</i>

27:07.532 --> 27:08.983
is paved with good intentions.

27:08.984 --> 27:10.868
<i>Mouse was starting to feel
the same could be said</i>

27:10.869 --> 27:12.319
<i>of the road to Harvard.</i>

27:12.320 --> 27:14.371
<i>She was finally ready
to stop paving.</i>

27:14.372 --> 27:16.373
Listen, this is kind of sad,
watching you suck up

27:16.374 --> 27:18.492
to these popular kids.

27:18.493 --> 27:20.710
You don't need them.
You went to Harvard.

27:20.712 --> 27:22.630
And you're a smart Asian chick.

27:22.631 --> 27:24.081
We may be a dime a dozen,

27:24.082 --> 27:26.270
but that doesn't mean
we're not awesome.

27:30.638 --> 27:32.985
I really could have used
a friend like you.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.591
You're a cool chick.

27:34.593 --> 27:37.428
Although you could be
a tad less bitchy

27:37.429 --> 27:39.597
to someone who can
actually help you.

27:39.598 --> 27:42.465
Got it.

27:45.937 --> 27:50.127
Basketball team, yearbook photo,
end of the hall! Now!

27:51.642 --> 27:53.911
Not that end. This end,

27:53.912 --> 27:56.247
where they're taking
the yearbook pictures!

27:56.248 --> 27:58.552
Oy, vey. My goodness.

28:02.369 --> 28:03.954
Hi, boys.

28:03.955 --> 28:06.874
Hey, Donna.

28:06.875 --> 28:08.926
Trolling for your next victim?

28:08.927 --> 28:10.660
Victim?

28:10.662 --> 28:12.295
Well, you can't seem to go
20 minutes without a guy.

28:12.297 --> 28:14.380
Oh, <i>I</i> can.
They just won't let me.

28:14.382 --> 28:17.952
Funny. Walt didn't seem
to find you irresistible.

28:17.953 --> 28:20.603
How long did that last?
What was it, two weeks?

28:20.605 --> 28:22.522
Hmm, not quite.
Not surprised.

28:22.524 --> 28:25.441
You're not his type.
You're right. I'm not.

28:25.443 --> 28:28.561
Coincidentally, or... maybe not,

28:28.563 --> 28:30.230
Walt's decided he's not
mad at me anymore.

28:30.232 --> 28:31.982
I don't think it's a coincidence.

28:31.983 --> 28:34.318
I sincerely hope you don't expect

28:34.319 --> 28:35.881
to get back together with him.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.570
I'm sure that's what <i>you</i> hope.

28:37.572 --> 28:39.874
Oh, honey, I know
you won't believe me,

28:39.875 --> 28:41.659
but I'm saying this
for your own good.

28:41.660 --> 28:44.245
Move on while you can.

28:44.246 --> 28:45.529
I've seen your mother.

28:45.530 --> 28:47.684
You won't have
that metabolism forever.

28:48.832 --> 28:50.717
I get your little game.
It's not gonna work.

28:50.719 --> 28:54.004
Maggie may not have been ready
<i>to move on,</i>

28:54.005 --> 28:55.638
<i>but Sebastian was...</i>

28:55.640 --> 28:56.840
<i>To his next drink.</i>

28:58.977 --> 29:01.645
There you are.

29:01.646 --> 29:03.814
Hey. There <i>you</i> are.

29:03.815 --> 29:06.150
Okay, I've only been gone
a few minutes.

29:06.151 --> 29:08.051
How many of those have you had?

29:08.052 --> 29:09.186
Three.

29:09.187 --> 29:11.238
Four.

29:12.357 --> 29:13.774
Oh, don't worry.
I'm fine.

29:13.775 --> 29:15.526
You don't seem fine.

29:15.527 --> 29:16.943
Is... is something going on?

29:16.945 --> 29:19.580
A party, in case
you hadn't noticed.

29:19.581 --> 29:23.929
And something else was going on
<i>with Walt and Bennet.</i>

29:24.095 --> 29:27.037
<i>As I watched them,
I began to wonder.</i>

29:27.038 --> 29:29.123
Hey, there's Walt.

29:29.124 --> 29:30.540
Who's the guy?

29:30.542 --> 29:33.677
Uh...
Someone I work with.

29:33.678 --> 29:35.911
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should go.

29:35.913 --> 29:37.214
No, let's go talk to 'em.

29:37.215 --> 29:39.432
We don't have to.

29:39.434 --> 29:41.018
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

29:41.019 --> 29:43.102
Hope we're not interrupting.

29:43.104 --> 29:44.825
Oh, not at all. I thought
you couldn't come tonight.

29:44.991 --> 29:47.524
- Oh, I couldn't miss her birthday.
- It's your birthday?

29:47.525 --> 29:49.276
Uh...
Whoa. Second base.

29:50.612 --> 29:53.029
Yeah, he's a little drunk.
Happy Birthday to me.

29:53.031 --> 29:54.982
Oh, I saw you talking
to Tripp Ramsey earlier.

29:54.983 --> 29:57.335
Is he interested in you? I know
he likes to get them young.

29:57.336 --> 29:59.119
- Oh.
- Wait. Is some guy hitting on you?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.904
Was it that guy you
introduced me to? Where is he?

30:00.905 --> 30:01.955
No, he's...

30:01.957 --> 30:03.824
He's a publisher
with young authors.

30:03.825 --> 30:05.941
- Then why would he be talking to you?
- Well, it's kind of a crazy story,

30:05.943 --> 30:08.245
but Larissa made it seem like
I have a book,

30:08.246 --> 30:10.130
which is really more like
journal musings.

30:10.131 --> 30:14.083
So go seal the deal.
He's right over there.

30:14.085 --> 30:16.553
You wanna go? Let's go.
I'm with you all the way.

30:16.554 --> 30:17.888
We'll go together. I can be...

30:17.889 --> 30:19.173
I can be very charming.

30:19.174 --> 30:22.509
Oh. Um, you know what?
Maybe some other time, okay?

30:22.510 --> 30:23.978
Okay.
I should get you home.

30:23.979 --> 30:25.229
All right.

30:25.230 --> 30:29.350
<i>It looked like my big break
would have to wait.</i>

30:29.351 --> 30:30.914
Thanks.

30:36.020 --> 30:37.127
This isn't going to work

30:37.293 --> 30:38.972
unless some of you guys kneel down.

30:40.963 --> 30:42.642
I wish you could have heard Donna.

30:42.643 --> 30:44.926
She basically said that Walt
isn't over me,

30:44.928 --> 30:46.479
and that's why they broke up.

30:46.480 --> 30:50.533
Really? Is that what she said,
or is that what you heard?

30:50.534 --> 30:51.984
No one's kneeling.

30:53.821 --> 30:55.938
Okay, you wanna be in this photo,

30:55.939 --> 30:58.106
you gotta kneel down.
You...

30:58.108 --> 31:00.108
Kneel. You, kneel. Kneel.

31:00.110 --> 31:01.944
Why are you still doing this?

31:01.945 --> 31:03.162
That poison Ivy Leaguer's
long gone.

31:03.164 --> 31:05.330
I like organizing things.

31:05.332 --> 31:07.250
Come on, guys. We don't have
all day. Let's go.

31:07.251 --> 31:08.783
Perfect.

31:08.785 --> 31:09.993
They're ready.

31:11.671 --> 31:13.105
Say, "bulldogs""

31:13.107 --> 31:14.507
Bulldogs.

31:14.508 --> 31:17.926
No one has ever been able to get
all of us together at one time.

31:17.928 --> 31:19.229
I had no idea it would be this easy

31:19.230 --> 31:20.396
to order a bunch of jocks around.

31:20.397 --> 31:22.732
You know what? She should be
our team manager.

31:22.733 --> 31:23.765
Ah, I don't know.

31:23.767 --> 31:25.351
Why not? She's smart,

31:25.352 --> 31:27.986
she's organized, and we need one.

31:27.988 --> 31:29.780
We didn't even have a team photo
in the yearbook last year.

31:29.781 --> 31:30.880
What would I have to do?

31:30.881 --> 31:33.525
Bookkeeping, scheduling,
recording statistics.

31:33.527 --> 31:36.686
Oh, that sounds boring.
That's what I do for fun.

31:36.852 --> 31:38.915
We'd have to ask the coach.
I doubt he'd agree

31:38.916 --> 31:40.082
to have a girl as team manager.

31:40.084 --> 31:41.201
Keep trying to talk me out of it.

31:41.202 --> 31:44.671
That just makes me
more determined to do it.

31:44.672 --> 31:46.372
<i>In life, I'll travel many roads...</i>

31:47.625 --> 31:49.209
<i>But hopefully,
none will be as terrifying</i>

31:49.210 --> 31:51.778
<i>as the merritt parkway
in stick shift.</i>

31:54.131 --> 31:56.015
- You okay?
- Mnh.

31:56.016 --> 31:57.832
You're a terrible driver.

32:00.354 --> 32:02.128
But you're an amazing girlfriend.

32:02.294 --> 32:04.189
Sebastian.

32:04.191 --> 32:07.227
You care about me.

32:07.228 --> 32:09.135
I feel like you're
the only one who does.

32:11.481 --> 32:12.682
Is this about your mother?

32:12.683 --> 32:16.235
This is about my mother.

32:17.487 --> 32:19.589
I'm sorry I ruined
the party for you.

32:19.590 --> 32:21.207
No, you didn't.

32:21.208 --> 32:23.024
I should've left right away.

32:23.190 --> 32:25.026
I knew you were upset.
I could see it.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.631
What happened?

32:28.632 --> 32:31.550
What always happens.

32:31.552 --> 32:34.369
Something came up.

32:34.371 --> 32:36.171
Something always comes up.

32:36.173 --> 32:39.558
I don't understand why
your mother hurts you like this.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.894
Yeah, I don't either, Carrie.

32:41.895 --> 32:43.595
Maybe I deserve it or something.

32:43.597 --> 32:46.282
No. No.

32:46.283 --> 32:48.317
You deserve so much more.

32:48.319 --> 32:51.136
I believe it when you say it.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.889
<i>That night, Sebastian told me
a lot about his journey,</i>

32:54.055 --> 32:57.225
<i>and I helped carry
some of his baggage.</i>

32:59.362 --> 33:00.563
I <i>could</i> go to college...

33:00.564 --> 33:02.899
Pretty much any college I wanted,

33:02.900 --> 33:05.535
but... for what?

33:05.536 --> 33:09.538
I only wanna go to college
to get away from my family.

33:11.341 --> 33:12.866
There are no accidents.

33:13.032 --> 33:16.378
Whatever happens,
it's... it's what's meant to be.

33:16.380 --> 33:20.717
The real reason
you took those tapes?

33:20.718 --> 33:21.851
So this could happen.

33:21.852 --> 33:24.127
You and me.

33:28.758 --> 33:30.926
Have anyone ever kissed you,
Dorrit?

33:30.928 --> 33:34.179
No.

33:36.733 --> 33:38.034
Can I be the first?

33:38.035 --> 33:41.353
Yes.

33:58.338 --> 34:00.705
<i>Dorrit wasn't the only one
that night</i>

34:00.871 --> 34:04.143
<i>who crossed paths
with a meaningful new person.</i>

34:04.144 --> 34:08.481
So... would you wanna
hang out again?

34:08.482 --> 34:09.965
I know I'm just a High School kid

34:09.966 --> 34:10.982
from Connecticut.

34:11.297 --> 34:13.101
Anytime, Walt.

34:15.138 --> 34:18.908
<i>♪ fly like the wind,
fly like the wind ♪</i>

34:29.150 --> 34:30.610
my dad's out of town.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.289
Do you have to get home,
or can you stay?

34:34.291 --> 34:37.592
I can stay.

34:37.594 --> 34:39.712
I'll tell my dad
I'm sleeping at Maggie's.

34:39.713 --> 34:42.130
And frankly, I'm too terrified
to drive your car

34:42.132 --> 34:44.299
back to my house anyway.

34:44.301 --> 34:46.851
Thank you...
For being here.

34:46.853 --> 34:48.520
I feel bad.

34:48.522 --> 34:50.088
What a crappy birthday for you.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.466
Oh. I wouldn't wanna be
anywhere else.

35:09.542 --> 35:12.245
Bast! I'm here.

35:12.246 --> 35:14.863
Honey, I'm here.

35:26.373 --> 35:28.937
I know I'm late,
but I feel like I've been

35:28.938 --> 35:30.322
through an emotional meat grinder.

35:30.323 --> 35:32.524
That bastard Lucas...
He thinks I can't tell

35:32.525 --> 35:34.442
he's been cheating on me,

35:34.444 --> 35:37.111
after what I've been through
with your father?

35:37.113 --> 35:39.897
You're just gonna stand there?

35:39.899 --> 35:44.476
Mom, my friend's here.
I'm sorry about this.

35:44.642 --> 35:47.038
- I'm sorry, too. What was your name?
- Carrie.

35:47.040 --> 35:49.590
Carrie.

35:49.592 --> 35:52.677
Uh, just give me a minute.
I can get her to leave.

35:52.679 --> 35:55.146
No, be with her.
She needs you.

35:55.148 --> 35:56.331
I was really excited.

35:56.332 --> 35:58.383
Yeah, me, too.

35:58.385 --> 36:00.436
I should at least drive you home.

36:00.437 --> 36:01.853
No, you've been drinking,

36:01.855 --> 36:04.222
and it's only a mile.
 I can handle it.

36:04.224 --> 36:05.773
You sure? I'm worried.

36:05.775 --> 36:07.092
No, I'm good,

36:07.093 --> 36:10.210
now that I know the clutch
is the pedal on the left.

36:13.232 --> 36:15.173
It was nice meeting you.

36:21.373 --> 36:24.776
<i>Robert frost once wrote,</i>

36:24.777 --> 36:27.227
<i>"two roads diverged

36:27.393 --> 36:29.780

36:32.919 --> 36:36.004

Morning.

37:00.646 --> 37:01.829
Morning.

37:01.831 --> 37:03.581
Um, you want some juice?

37:03.583 --> 37:06.451
Um... yeah. Sure.

37:06.453 --> 37:08.420
So how was your birthday?
Fine.

37:08.421 --> 37:10.589
Sort of a non-event.

37:10.590 --> 37:12.591
Well, maybe this...

37:12.592 --> 37:14.842
Will make it a little more special.

37:14.844 --> 37:18.045
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to give it to you yesterday.

37:18.047 --> 37:20.498
Happy Birthday.

37:24.686 --> 37:26.137
Is this what I think it is?

37:26.139 --> 37:27.605
If you think it's a credit card.

37:28.775 --> 37:29.974
That's impossible.

37:29.976 --> 37:31.776
I have my own credit card.

37:31.778 --> 37:32.894
All right, look,
I am entrusting you

37:32.896 --> 37:34.146
not to go crazy
with this thing, all right?

37:34.147 --> 37:35.679
There's a limit on that...
A very small limit.

37:35.681 --> 37:38.983
Yes, I will be very responsible
with it, I promise.

37:38.985 --> 37:40.685
So... can I go take
my friends out for breakfast

37:40.686 --> 37:41.786
at the diner?

37:41.788 --> 37:44.289
- Sure.
- Okay.

37:44.290 --> 37:46.541
I have my own credit card!

37:48.378 --> 37:51.662
Dorrit!

37:51.664 --> 37:53.498
Guess what I got for my birthday.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.367
A credit card.
A credit card.

37:55.368 --> 37:57.635
And this.

37:57.637 --> 38:00.672
You made me a mixtape?

38:00.673 --> 38:03.948
Oh, sweetie.

38:04.114 --> 38:06.545
I can't believe
you made me a mixtape.

38:06.546 --> 38:09.148
Don't have a cow.

38:09.149 --> 38:11.098
It's a big deal.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.416
No one's ever made me one before.

38:15.053 --> 38:16.405
The day <i>after</i> my birthday

38:16.406 --> 38:19.391
is turning out way better

I asked her to meet me here.
