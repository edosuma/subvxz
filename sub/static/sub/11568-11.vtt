and slip out of those little

she had a pet bird.

This is my friend Cassie

Hi, nice to meet you, Cassie.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.457
Oh, and this is
our butler, Marquess.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.059
What?
I'm not your butler.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.328
What are you talking about?
You just made me a sandwich.

01:36.363 --> 01:39.131
You do all the cleaning.
You wear that butler outfit.

up to today, hmm?

to help me pack for our trip.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.175

01:50.210 --> 01:51.543

We're going to Miami.

Oh, I sure did.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.407
I don't like it,
but I heard it.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.409
So, are we clear,
young lady?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.112
Yeah?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.613

sitting around, open,
for ants to drink.

in your room.

how to do your job, Marquess,

I was talking to you!

03:06.720 --> 03:09.821
I was telling you about
when I was an altar boy,

03:09.856 --> 03:13.558
and Father Ferdinand
took me up to the belfry
and made me...

03:13.593 --> 03:15.327
I can't say it again.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.796
(SOBBING) It was hard
enough saying it once.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.297
Hey, guys,
help me find a mystery

03:19.332 --> 03:21.099

to solve a mystery.

winking at me for,

trying on swimsuits.
-What the (BLEEP)?

Why didn't you tell me that
instead of wasting all my time

03:47.560 --> 03:49.060
with that awful
molestation tale?

03:49.095 --> 03:50.329
How dare you!

03:51.631 --> 03:54.032

04:04.077 --> 04:07.479

found a mystery that
takes place in Miami?

04:07.514 --> 04:10.882
No, Cuba.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.324
(PIGEON EXCLAIMS, GROANS)

04:20.060 --> 04:21.260
It was worth it.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.133
So, basically, we would like
your help

04:28.168 --> 04:32.137
in transitioning away from
communism to capitalism.

04:32.172 --> 04:35.874
But do this in a way
that does not make it seem
like we are backpedaling

04:35.909 --> 04:37.709
or admitting a mistake.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.878
We don't want to hear,
"I told you so."

04:39.913 --> 04:42.247
I mean, we really
don't want to hear that, okay?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.948
This, "I told you so." Please.

04:43.983 --> 04:46.651
No one likes to hear,
"I told you so."

04:46.686 --> 04:48.920
Nobody likes to hear,
"I told you so."

04:52.726 --> 04:56.194
So, how do you want
to proceed?

04:56.229 --> 04:59.664
Well, normally, what we do
when we take on a new mystery

04:59.699 --> 05:02.400
is hear about the mystery,
which we just did.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.935
So, we can check that
off the list.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.805
Then we shift into
our period of reflection,

05:06.840 --> 05:10.208
which you just got
a little taste of
when we got quiet.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.143
And it was like,
"Who's gonna talk next?"

05:12.178 --> 05:16.348
And that period
could last anywhere from
a few minutes to a few days.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.651
What's your mystery again?

05:19.686 --> 05:23.488
Hmm. We want to switch from
a central-planned economy

05:23.523 --> 05:26.024
to more like
a free-market system.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.927
But, like, without saying
we are really doing that.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.295
You know what I mean?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.365
Okay, cool.
So, your mystery is more
complicated than most.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.435
So, I'm gonna
definitely estimate
in a few days of reflection.

05:37.470 --> 05:41.172
We'll be in Miami for the
next couple of days for spring
break, and we'll call you.

05:41.207 --> 05:42.574
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.709
You must stay in Cuba
until the job is done.

05:44.744 --> 05:48.780
We will put you up in one of
our finest government-run
boarding houses.

05:48.815 --> 05:51.583
Oh, well, if it is as nice
as this office,

05:51.618 --> 05:54.119
then it's gonna be
a piece of (BLEEP).

05:54.154 --> 05:56.721
You know, just like this
office is a piece of (BLEEP)?

05:56.756 --> 05:58.990
I think this office
is just a...

05:59.025 --> 06:01.526
This is really
the presidential office?

06:01.561 --> 06:05.897
And you are only now wondering
if you should rethink
your economic system?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.468
Okay, I think
we need to have a rule,

06:10.503 --> 06:12.470
that from now on,
we don't go on a mystery

06:12.505 --> 06:14.672
until all of us
have read the mystery,

06:14.707 --> 06:17.142
because I don't even
understand this one.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.611
It seems like it's more
for an economics team,

06:19.646 --> 06:21.346
or a bunch of diplomats.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.914
It also seems dangerous.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.916
I'm pretty sure we're under
house arrest right now,

06:24.951 --> 06:27.152
and you know
they torture people here.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.421
These Castros,
they seem cute
and eccentric,

06:29.456 --> 06:33.425
with their cigars and their
mustaches, but they
torture people. They do.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.059
Yeah. Anyone who doesn't
agree with them.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.694
Poets, artists,
political dissidents.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.630
They lock them up. Really.
Yeah, I read it.

the outskirts of Miami.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.730

Key Biscayne.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.433

a snake or something.

He was with us, wasn't he?

07:45.732 --> 07:47.866
Oh, we must be in Orlando.
That's Epcot.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.037
Yeah, maybe.

Probably not, though, because
we never crossed the ocean.

Damn, looks like Miami
hasn't recovered
from the recession.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.068
Oh, wait. This is
way too shitty to be Miami.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.736
This gotta be Jacksonville.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.038
But we're close, Pigeon.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.973
Jacksonville isn't too far
from Miami.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.875
Let's start walking.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.512
