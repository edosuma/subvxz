WEBVTT

00:17.750 --> 00:19.125
Give me a syringe.

00:19.916 --> 00:21.750
Aren't you a nurse? Give me a syringe.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.041
Come on, quickly. Come on.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.083
Go out there,
and make sure no one comes in.

01:41.208 --> 01:42.291
HALLANGEN FUNERAL PARLOR

01:47.666 --> 01:49.416
Frode, I have good news.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.375
Did someone die?

01:51.916 --> 01:53.583
No, I'm going to be a dad.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.500
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.708
But I was wondering
if I could get a deferral because of…

01:59.791 --> 02:02.208
You're bankrupt.
I can't do anything about that.

02:03.541 --> 02:05.958
Are you sure you can't help me?

02:07.125 --> 02:08.541
If you manage to pay off

02:08.625 --> 02:11.291
30,000 kroner in the next two days,

02:11.833 --> 02:13.416
you can have a deferral.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.500
Okay. Thirty thousand?

02:17.083 --> 02:18.916
Is that realistic?

02:20.291 --> 02:21.208
Yeah.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.250
Yeah, no problem.

02:53.375 --> 02:56.166
INNLANDET HOSPITAL

03:02.875 --> 03:03.750
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:03.833 --> 03:06.583
Can we speak to
Reinert Tisthamar's doctor?

03:06.666 --> 03:07.500
Yes.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.333
Hi.

03:23.583 --> 03:24.458
Hi.

03:25.041 --> 03:28.000
You are a very lucky man, Reinert.

03:29.291 --> 03:32.541
Do you remember anything
that has happened in the past two days?

03:34.541 --> 03:36.875
-You're awake.
-Yes, he just woke up.

03:36.958 --> 03:39.375
Do you remember anything, Reinert?

03:41.208 --> 03:46.041
You were found in the woods
with Live, naked. She was carrying you.

03:46.625 --> 03:47.875
You had a bag over your head.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.791
He had an acute psychotic episode.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.125
Psychosis?

03:52.208 --> 03:54.791
Yes, a state of confusion
that can be triggered by anything.

03:54.875 --> 03:57.958
Yeah, but I can't be… I'm not psychotic…

03:58.041 --> 04:00.666
It's lucky that Live ran after you
and calmed you down.

04:02.166 --> 04:04.333
It was dangerous, but it was lucky.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.750
Can I go home now?

04:07.333 --> 04:09.291
Don't you think
it's best to stay a few days?

04:09.375 --> 04:10.500
No, I want to go home.

04:10.583 --> 04:14.500
Your vitals are good,
so I'll discharge you today.

04:14.583 --> 04:17.375
If you notice any changes,
you have to get in touch.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.791
I want you to come back
for a checkup next week.

04:24.416 --> 04:27.416
Sverre! You can't discharge him now!

04:27.500 --> 04:29.708
-Not now, Live.
-But how do you know about…

04:29.791 --> 04:30.875
Not here!

04:35.916 --> 04:38.583
Go home, and get some rest.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.416
Then I'll come…

04:41.500 --> 04:43.541
I'll come over tonight
and explain everything.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.000
But…

04:48.791 --> 04:49.958
Are you okay, Live?

04:52.875 --> 04:53.875
Yeah.

05:05.958 --> 05:06.875
Odd!

05:09.750 --> 05:10.625
Odd?

05:14.125 --> 05:14.958
Hey.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.875
What happened here?

05:19.291 --> 05:20.416
I…

05:22.541 --> 05:23.875
I…

05:25.125 --> 05:26.416
You have a customer.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.958
You have a customer in there
waiting for you.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.375
-For me?
-Yeah.

05:35.708 --> 05:36.708
Okay.

05:43.791 --> 05:45.083
-Hello.
-Hi.

05:46.541 --> 05:50.541
Relax. You don't have to express
your condolences or anything.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.750
I usually don't do that, but…

05:54.375 --> 05:55.375
Have a seat.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.833
So, what can I help you with?

06:04.166 --> 06:05.166
My second cousin.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.333
A hell of a guy.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.208
-Lived in Sweden, just died.
-Yeah.

06:11.291 --> 06:13.250
And it's important for me and the family

06:13.333 --> 06:16.750
that he is buried
in his hometown, Skarnes.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.041
I can understand that.

06:22.708 --> 06:23.666
Yeah.

06:26.375 --> 06:29.750
That kind of ceremony
involves a lot of work.

06:29.833 --> 06:35.416
You'll need a death certificate,
a passport for the body…

06:35.500 --> 06:37.750
-It's a long journey--
-How much does it cost?

06:43.625 --> 06:45.750
Let me think. How much does that cost?

06:46.791 --> 06:47.875
Drive over there…

06:47.958 --> 06:49.125
OVERDUE

06:52.458 --> 06:53.791
Thirty thousand.

06:58.541 --> 06:59.958
Thirty thousand, that's good.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.166
-Thirty thousand.
-Yes.

07:16.291 --> 07:19.000
I can't take it!
Can I please have some blood?

07:19.083 --> 07:21.625
-No.
-I need it, just a little.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.791
Please, I need some.
I just need some blood.

07:26.541 --> 07:28.666
I recommended that she make these.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.541
-How do you know about…
-When Madeleine came to Skarnes…

07:36.291 --> 07:37.250
She was different.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.166
I only realized how different
when she became ill.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.833
It was a night in December.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.708
Arvid almost had to carry her to the door.

07:49.375 --> 07:52.041
And, as far as I know,
it was the first time

07:52.125 --> 07:54.666
she seriously tried
to stop drinking blood.

07:56.166 --> 07:59.416
All that pain, all that madness…

08:01.541 --> 08:05.583
She was terrified that I would expose her,
but I helped her.

08:07.166 --> 08:08.833
You helped her?

08:09.625 --> 08:11.208
We helped each other.

08:11.750 --> 08:12.958
A doctor and a patient.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.458
Doctors have existed
for thousands of years.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.875
In the form of witch doctors,
shamans, monks…

08:20.416 --> 08:22.875
Our mission is to cure diseases,

08:23.625 --> 08:26.083
ease pain, prolong life.

08:27.416 --> 08:29.541
What was it that made her body

08:30.666 --> 08:32.416
heal itself?

08:33.375 --> 08:35.500
What kept her young?

08:36.750 --> 08:40.875
If only I could've extracted
those qualities from her blood

08:41.916 --> 08:43.583
and created a vaccine from it.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.916
Oh, I could have…

08:46.500 --> 08:48.666
I could have found
the key to eternal life.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.125
But you didn't?

08:52.208 --> 08:53.125
No.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.583
We came close, but Madeleine, she…

08:57.666 --> 08:58.750
Killed herself.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.208
Judith!

09:16.166 --> 09:17.041
Judith?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.458
I can't find the last piece.
Have you seen it?

09:21.541 --> 09:24.333
It's probably lying there somewhere.

09:35.916 --> 09:36.750
What is it?

09:45.333 --> 09:46.791
I was the one who found Live.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.000
I would have bet
everything I have that she was dead.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.416
It's good that you didn't.

09:58.708 --> 10:00.541
And just a few days later,

10:01.166 --> 10:04.500
their father dies
after a forceful blow to the chest.

10:05.416 --> 10:08.625
And Reinert,
who's been in love with Live for years,

10:08.708 --> 10:10.958
he just disappears,
and then he shows up again

10:11.041 --> 10:13.708
a few days later, all of a sudden,
in the woods with Live,

10:13.791 --> 10:15.916
under the most peculiar circumstances.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.166
And no one wants to say anything.

10:22.041 --> 10:25.416
Remember when you asked me to tell you
when you got too conspiratorial?

10:28.666 --> 10:29.625
What do you mean?

10:33.416 --> 10:36.291
Some people in town thought
you drove Madeleine to her death.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.416
Yes, I know that.

10:42.625 --> 10:46.458
Ever since you were little,
Madeleine felt that you were like her.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.166
So she knew about this the whole time?

10:50.208 --> 10:51.500
And never said anything?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.833
She didn't want
these thoughts to rule your life.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.041
And who would have thought

10:57.625 --> 11:00.708
that when you died,
this would wake up inside you?

11:11.125 --> 11:14.375
-Why did you lie about my apparent death?
-To protect you.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.708
The problem now

11:17.750 --> 11:19.916
is that you've passed this on to Reinert.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.333
But they believe he had an episode.

11:23.875 --> 11:24.708
At the moment.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.541
But the hunger…

11:27.625 --> 11:30.291
Sooner or later,
he will kill innocent people.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.000
There must be something
we can do to prevent that.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.541
Yes. We have to burn him.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.000
Burn him?

11:45.083 --> 11:47.458
It's the only surefire way to kill him.

11:51.416 --> 11:52.791
But he's like me.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.583
Live, he's not like you.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.833
I gave him blood today,

11:58.166 --> 12:00.666
but what do you think will happen tomorrow

12:01.291 --> 12:02.791
if he doesn't get blood then?

12:03.708 --> 12:05.125
No, you have to let me talk to him.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.125
Fine.

12:09.708 --> 12:10.958
I'll give you until tomorrow.

12:11.458 --> 12:13.125
But then we have to do something.

12:13.958 --> 12:15.000
Take these with you.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.333
One for him and one for you.

12:19.875 --> 12:20.708
Thank you.

12:51.708 --> 12:52.708
There.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.000
I promise we'll renovate
the bathroom soon, honey.

12:59.541 --> 13:00.791
Make a proper nursery.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.333
Fix up the pool and…

13:27.375 --> 13:31.416
You have reached
the voicemail of officer Reinert…

13:31.500 --> 13:32.500
Smoothie!

13:34.041 --> 13:35.041
It's not for you.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.375
Give me some. I'm going for a long drive.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.625
-Long drive?
-Yeah.

13:40.458 --> 13:41.333
Just to Sweden.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.541
A Norwegian's fatal trip
across the border.

13:44.625 --> 13:47.833
And you know what? I'm making
30,000 in cash, straight into my pocket.

13:47.916 --> 13:49.000
Check you out!

13:49.750 --> 13:52.208
Don't try to distract me
from the smoothie. Give me some.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.958
It's for Reinert. I'm going to see him.

13:55.041 --> 13:55.916
Before work?

13:56.458 --> 13:57.291
Yeah.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.041
Oh my God.

14:00.791 --> 14:01.666
Jerk.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.375
You like him.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.500
I've known him for 20 years.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.500
I haven't suddenly begun to like him.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.291
I'm just trying to be nice.

14:17.666 --> 14:18.583
Yuck.

14:20.541 --> 14:21.625
What's in it?

14:22.208 --> 14:23.083
Beets?

14:23.875 --> 14:24.750
Yeah.

14:25.541 --> 14:26.916
Tastes horrible.

14:28.708 --> 14:31.208
-It's healthy.
-I don't give a shit. Yuck.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.833
-I'm going.
-Okay.

14:32.916 --> 14:34.041
-Bye!
-Bye!

15:05.750 --> 15:06.583
Reinert?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.375
Hello?

15:12.583 --> 15:13.791
Reinert, are you here?

15:21.166 --> 15:22.125
Hello?

15:31.541 --> 15:32.541
Hi.

15:36.708 --> 15:37.708
What are you doing here?

15:39.791 --> 15:41.666
I just wanted to talk to you about…

15:41.750 --> 15:43.500
Shit. I have to go.

15:48.041 --> 15:50.541
Shouldn't you take a day off?

15:50.625 --> 15:52.041
No, I have to go to work.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.375
Okay.

15:54.458 --> 15:58.833
Well, anyway, I made smoothies
for the Hallangen crew this morning,

15:58.916 --> 16:00.625
so maybe you'd like some?

16:00.708 --> 16:02.166
I'm not really hungry.

16:02.750 --> 16:06.000
You have to get some nutrition.
You look kind of tired.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.166
Nice.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.291
What if you have another episode?

16:09.375 --> 16:11.958
The doctor discharged me,
so I'll probably be fine.

16:25.416 --> 16:27.583
You know that day
I woke up on the autopsy table?

16:29.208 --> 16:31.750
Since then…

16:34.583 --> 16:36.083
I haven't been able to sleep at night.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.208
My senses are totally different.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.000
Smell and taste and…

16:44.166 --> 16:46.083
It's just not… It's just not the same.

16:46.791 --> 16:48.666
I can hear people's pulses.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.750
You saw it yourself
that day with Jettland.

16:54.583 --> 16:55.791
The day I pushed you.

16:56.333 --> 16:58.833
You feel like you're going crazy, right?

16:58.916 --> 17:00.916
-And it's because you need blood--
-Shush!

17:08.375 --> 17:09.750
I just have to get to work.

17:17.083 --> 17:18.083
Reinert!

17:33.000 --> 17:34.958
-Hi, Frode. It's Odd.
-Hi, Odd.

17:35.041 --> 17:37.166
I'll come by the bank
tomorrow with the money.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.625
Did you sort it out?

17:40.125 --> 17:41.666
Like Dad used to say, you know,

17:42.208 --> 17:44.791
"Living is dangerous.
No one has survived it yet."

17:55.125 --> 17:56.375
-Hi, Live.
-Hi.

17:58.416 --> 17:59.541
Where's Reinert?

17:59.625 --> 18:02.458
We thought he might need
a few days to recover…

18:02.541 --> 18:03.875
-Live!
-…after all the…

18:04.458 --> 18:06.625
Do you have time
to step into my office for a moment?

18:06.708 --> 18:08.583
It won't take long. Five minutes.

18:08.666 --> 18:10.041
I was just…

18:10.166 --> 18:12.375
I just want to talk about
what happened yesterday.

18:15.958 --> 18:16.916
Yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.125
There are a couple of things
I struggle to wrap my head around.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.500
I have to write a report about this.

18:22.583 --> 18:23.583
Okay.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.750
The night Arvid died…

18:29.833 --> 18:31.500
Isn't this about Reinert?

18:32.333 --> 18:33.625
Yeah, sort of.

18:34.166 --> 18:36.416
But Reinert was investigating
Arvid's death.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.500
And he suspected you, Live.

18:40.916 --> 18:45.083
I don't understand what this is about.
It sounds like an interrogation.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.791
Does it?

18:49.875 --> 18:50.791
Yeah, a little.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.291
That was unintentional.

19:05.458 --> 19:10.333
INTERNATIONAL BORDER
SWEDEN

19:34.750 --> 19:36.125
-Yes?
-Hi.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.375
I'm from Hallangen Funeral Parlor.

19:38.458 --> 19:42.625
I'm here to pick up… one Bendik Kvale.

19:49.625 --> 19:50.625
Hello?

19:52.875 --> 19:55.625
He's not ready yet.
You'll have to come back this evening.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
All right.

20:15.541 --> 20:17.541
-Hi.
-Have you given him the blood?

20:19.208 --> 20:20.416
No, not yet.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.625
Live, you have to give him the blood now.

20:24.958 --> 20:25.875
I'm on my way to him.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.708
You don't want more lives
on your conscience, do you?

20:29.458 --> 20:32.000
No, but listen.
I'm meeting him soon, and then…

20:32.083 --> 20:33.791
-Good.
-And then I'll talk to him.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.708
-Okay?
-Good. Bye.

20:36.791 --> 20:37.625
Bye.

20:48.708 --> 20:49.541
Fuck.

22:35.958 --> 22:37.291
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:40.958 --> 22:42.458
That's a really nice hearse.

22:44.291 --> 22:45.250
Thanks.

22:47.083 --> 22:48.708
How can you afford something like this?

22:49.333 --> 22:52.958
Well… it's the result of good business.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.250
How do you make that happen?

23:01.375 --> 23:02.333
Make what happen?

23:02.416 --> 23:03.666
A good business.

23:04.291 --> 23:09.083
Or, how do you sell a casket
for 59,000 to someone who's grieving?

23:10.083 --> 23:12.750
I don't sell to those who are grieving.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.125
I sell to the deceased.

23:15.708 --> 23:17.416
-The deceased?
-Yeah.

23:20.916 --> 23:22.791
How do you know what the deceased wanted?

23:23.791 --> 23:24.833
I don't.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
But neither do the ones who are grieving.

23:30.958 --> 23:31.916
Hallangen?

23:32.500 --> 23:33.875
Yes, hello. One moment.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.833
One, two, three.

24:03.916 --> 24:05.250
Oh, wait a second.

24:07.041 --> 24:08.208
Oh boy!

24:11.750 --> 24:12.791
Hefty guy.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.500
Big-boned…

24:18.916 --> 24:20.500
Do you know the cause of death?

24:23.208 --> 24:24.208
What?

24:25.125 --> 24:26.125
How did he die?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.583
You're the driver, right?

24:30.541 --> 24:31.375
Yeah.

24:32.083 --> 24:34.291
And I'm the coroner.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.250
Yeah.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.166
Good luck.

24:44.750 --> 24:45.666
Thanks.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.458
What am I transporting?

26:22.541 --> 26:28.708
You didn't really think you'd make 30,000
transporting an ordinary body, did you?

26:30.125 --> 26:33.041
Just get back to Skarnes
and all will be well.

26:40.125 --> 26:41.166
Shit.

26:52.666 --> 26:54.791
WHAT HAPPENED TO LIVE?

27:06.208 --> 27:07.791
-Hi.
-Where are you?

27:08.541 --> 27:10.291
-I'm at work.
-Still?

27:10.833 --> 27:12.833
-Yeah.
-It's dinner time.

27:12.916 --> 27:15.375
Your favorite.
Sausage and mashed rutabaga.

27:15.458 --> 27:18.791
Don't worry about it. I'll grab
something at the gas station later.

27:18.875 --> 27:21.625
Is it the Hallangen thing?

27:21.708 --> 27:22.750
Yeah.

27:22.833 --> 27:26.333
Isn't it better to focus on
what you can actually prove?

27:26.916 --> 27:27.916
Like what?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.833
Like the drugs you found
in the bookmobile, for instance.

27:31.916 --> 27:35.416
I've already asked customs
to stop all cars at the border.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.125
Shit.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.416
There we go.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.666
I'd like to see your driver's license.

28:08.958 --> 28:10.000
No.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.250
You've reached Martin Jettland.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.041
-I can't come to the phone--
-This…

29:06.041 --> 29:07.000
Hi.

29:07.875 --> 29:10.791
You didn't see a police officer
run past here just now, did you?

29:11.333 --> 29:12.166
No.

29:14.125 --> 29:15.750
You need to get out of here.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.750
-Why?
-Just…

29:18.416 --> 29:19.458
Go home.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.041
Good evening.

29:40.083 --> 29:42.250
-Hi.
-Hi there.

29:43.083 --> 29:45.250
I'd like to see
your license and registration.

29:45.333 --> 29:46.250
Yes, of course.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.125
Let's see…

29:50.458 --> 29:51.833
Thank you.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.333
What are you transporting?

29:59.875 --> 30:00.708
A body.

30:03.083 --> 30:05.416
A dead person. His name was Bendik.

30:18.166 --> 30:20.916
Can you step out and open the trunk?

30:22.208 --> 30:23.208
Yeah.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.416
-Are you sure you want to…
-Come on.

30:38.250 --> 30:39.083
Yeah.

30:49.916 --> 30:53.250
-Do you want me to open the casket?
-No, that's fine.

31:50.541 --> 31:52.291
Hi, you've reached Live Hallangen.

31:52.375 --> 31:53.875
I can't come to the phone right…

31:56.750 --> 31:57.750
Shit!

32:07.541 --> 32:09.125
Guys, let's get out of here.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.416
Wait a second.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.041
Let him finish first.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.916
Guys! The cops!

32:25.166 --> 32:27.291
You have reached the voicemail of…

32:31.041 --> 32:32.041
I'm sorry!

32:37.458 --> 32:38.458
I'm sorry!

33:23.708 --> 33:24.750
Reinert?

33:36.375 --> 33:37.208
No!

33:50.916 --> 33:51.833
Hi, it's Sverre.

33:52.416 --> 33:54.083
I think something awful has happened.

33:54.625 --> 33:57.916
Yes, I know.
I'm on my way out to the old barn. I…

33:58.000 --> 34:00.208
-You know?
-Yes.

34:00.291 --> 34:03.125
I managed to stop him. Meet me there.

34:29.833 --> 34:33.666
Listen, if Odd could manage it,
it can't be that hard.

34:39.708 --> 34:40.666
She's a librarian.

34:41.541 --> 34:45.083
-Was a librarian.
-Until she crashed the book van.

34:45.916 --> 34:47.083
Right.

34:50.041 --> 34:51.541
We'll handle it from here, Odd.

34:53.041 --> 34:55.125
Okay, so I can…

35:31.375 --> 35:32.583
It's the police.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.375
-Coming.
-Open up.

35:34.458 --> 35:35.541
Yeah, I'm coming!

35:36.208 --> 35:38.541
-Just a moment, I'll…
-Is that you, Odd?

35:40.875 --> 35:44.458
They called and said
you'd been in the bathroom for two hours.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.708
Only drug addicts
lock themselves in the bathroom.

35:50.958 --> 35:54.000
It's been tough since Dad died.

35:54.875 --> 35:55.833
Financially.

35:56.416 --> 35:57.291
Yeah.

35:59.333 --> 36:00.750
No one dies in Skarnes.

36:00.833 --> 36:01.708
No.

36:02.875 --> 36:05.000
But I didn't know it was this bad.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.000
Now I don't really know what to do.

36:11.083 --> 36:12.666
There's always something you can do.

36:14.083 --> 36:16.291
Sell something you don't need.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.708
The bank told me to sell my car.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.666
That would make it easy
to be a funeral agent.

36:22.208 --> 36:24.458
What about the storage unit?
Can't you sell that?

36:25.583 --> 36:26.833
Sell the basement?

36:26.916 --> 36:29.333
No, the storage unit
on the other side of the river.

36:30.291 --> 36:32.041
I don't have a storage unit there.

36:36.041 --> 36:37.250
Then I've misunderstood.

36:53.458 --> 36:54.416
What's going on?

36:55.541 --> 36:57.000
What happened in the tunnel?

36:58.208 --> 36:59.125
I stopped him

37:00.375 --> 37:01.791
and caught him.

37:06.375 --> 37:07.333
He's hungry.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.958
He's impossible to control.

37:12.041 --> 37:12.916
We have to do it.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.250
First, he has to drink this.

37:18.333 --> 37:19.750
Otherwise, he'll break out.

37:25.166 --> 37:27.125
If he bites me, I'll get sick too.

37:30.416 --> 37:33.416
You have to give him this.
And then you have to get out.

37:34.416 --> 37:35.708
And then we'll shut him in.

37:37.541 --> 37:38.833
Then you'll set it on fire?

37:39.708 --> 37:41.083
Then we'll set it on fire.

37:43.625 --> 37:45.500
He almost killed a child.

38:00.333 --> 38:01.375
Reinert?

38:08.666 --> 38:09.583
Reinert?

38:22.333 --> 38:23.416
What the fuck?

38:24.458 --> 38:25.500
Reinert!

38:57.041 --> 38:57.875
Sverre!

38:58.500 --> 38:59.333
Sverre!

39:00.041 --> 39:01.375
Sverre, what are you doing?

39:02.750 --> 39:03.833
Sverre!

39:07.250 --> 39:08.625
What are you doing?

39:10.666 --> 39:12.333
I'm sorry, Live.

39:22.666 --> 39:24.125
It was you.

39:24.750 --> 39:28.416
I have to finish
what your mother and I started.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.916
No, Sverre! No!

39:30.000 --> 39:31.958
No!

39:39.375 --> 39:40.375
Reinert.

39:41.375 --> 39:42.375
Reinert.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.375
Reinert.

39:56.541 --> 39:57.875
Sverre!

41:07.833 --> 41:08.750
Reinert.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.375
Sverre!

41:56.833 --> 41:58.416
Live.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.708
You killed me!

42:01.791 --> 42:04.166
I knew you'd come back, Live!

42:04.250 --> 42:05.833
Yeah, as a monster!

42:05.916 --> 42:07.791
Live, listen! Please, Live!

42:07.875 --> 42:10.375
I can help you. I can give you blood!

42:10.458 --> 42:13.708
Maybe you can have
a completely normal life!

43:09.083 --> 43:10.458
Reinert!

43:12.041 --> 43:13.583
No, Reinert!

43:18.000 --> 43:19.125
Reinert!

43:20.541 --> 43:21.625
Reinert!

43:26.291 --> 43:27.708
Reinert…

43:55.333 --> 43:56.291
Richard.

43:57.666 --> 43:58.500
Richard?

44:02.791 --> 44:06.291
The day after Arvid's funeral,
Live was dragging a stretcher.

44:07.250 --> 44:09.000
From their storage unit across the river.

44:10.666 --> 44:12.166
That's good.

44:12.875 --> 44:14.791
They don't have a storage unit there.

44:16.291 --> 44:18.000
-Judith…
-No, I have to.

44:39.916 --> 44:40.875
I'm sorry.

46:08.333 --> 46:12.375
