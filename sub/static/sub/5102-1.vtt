01:23.500 --> 01:27.471
I was born 1911, Chickasaw County,
Piedmont Plantation.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.932
And did you know,
as a girl growing up,

01:31.091 --> 01:32.513
that one day you'd be a maid?

01:33.343 --> 01:34.970
Yes, ma'am, I did.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.639
And you knew that because...

01:38.015 --> 01:41.315
My mama was a maid.
My grandmama was a house slave.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.482
House... slave.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.615
Do you ever dream
of being something else?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.792
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

01:57.951 --> 02:00.750
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

02:03.206 --> 02:05.083
It feel...

02:16.386 --> 02:19.856
I done raised 17 kids in my life.

02:20.015 --> 02:23.315
Looking after white babies,
that's what I do.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.401
Aibee, Aibee.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.611
- Hi!
- Aibee!

02:28.774 --> 02:32.870
I know how to get them babies to sleep,
stop crying and go in the toilet bow/

02:33.028 --> 02:35.030
before their mamas even
get out of bed in the morning.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.662
Babies like fat.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.795
They like big fat legs, too.
That I know.

02:41.953 --> 02:46.299
You is kind, you is smart...

02:46.458 --> 02:48.711
...you is important.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.346
- You is smart...
- Smart...

02:51.505 --> 02:54.054
...you is kind...
- ...you is kind...

02:54.216 --> 02:57.060
...you is important.
- ...you is important.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.646
That's so good.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.437
That's so good.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.361
I work for the Leefolts
from eight to four; six days a week.

03:09.523 --> 03:15.246
I make 95 cent an hour.
That comes to $182 every month.

03:16.488 --> 03:21.836
I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing,
ironing and grocery shopping.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.633
But mostly, I take care of Baby Girl.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.088
And, Lord, I worry she gonna be fat.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.756
Mae Mobley.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.051
Ain 't going to be
no beauty queen either.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.847
Aibileen, bridge club is in an hour.
Did you finish the chicken salad?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.014
- Yes.
- Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.854
- No paprika.
- Mm-hm.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.821
Does this dress look homemade?

03:51.148 --> 03:53.150
I reckon when you finish it won't.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.740
Well, thank you.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.907
Miss Leefolt still don't
pick Baby Girl up but once a day.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.452
The birthing blues got hold
of Miss Leefolt pretty hard.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.916
I done seen it happen plenty of times,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.332
once babies start having
their own babies.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.303
And the young
white ladies of Jackson...

04:21.470 --> 04:24.098
...oh Lord, was they having babies.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.062
But not Miss Skeeter.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.060
No man and no babies.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.096
- Morning.
- Hi.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.356
- My name is Eugenia Phelan, and...
- Come on.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.068
Eugenia Phelan, Mr. Blackly.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.118
Shut the damn door.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.750
I guarantee you, one day they're going
to figure out cigarettes will kill you.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.287
OK, Miss Phelan,
let's see what you got.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.543
editor.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.588
Ole Miss Rebel Rouser. editor.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.880
Double major.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.057
editor.

05:41.758 --> 05:45.058
- Damn, girl, don't you have fun?
- Is that important?

05:45.554 --> 05:47.522
- Do you have any references?
- Yes.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.192
Right here.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.151
This...

05:56.314 --> 05:58.032
This is a rejection letter.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.740
Not exactly. See, Miss Stein thought...

06:00.902 --> 06:02.575
Stein?

06:02.737 --> 06:05.160
Elaine Stein, from Harper and Row
Publishing in New York.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.540
Oh, Lord.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.418
I'm gonna be a serious writer,
Mr. Blackly.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.126
I applied for a job,
but Mrs. Stein thought...

06:12.289 --> 06:13.836
She said no.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.922
Well, until I gain some experience.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.427
See? Says right there.

06:17.586 --> 06:21.136
"Great potential. Gain some experience
and please apply again."

06:23.300 --> 06:26.429
Oh, Christ. I guess you'll do.
Do you clean?

06:26.970 --> 06:28.972
- I'm sorry. Clean?
- Clean.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.516
Grab that basket.

06:31.975 --> 06:35.479
Miss Myrna has gone
shit-house crazy on us.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.114
She drunk hairspray or something.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.526
I want you to read her past columns.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.366
Then read these letters and you
answer them just like she would.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.951
Nobody is gonna know
the damn difference.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.116
You know who Miss Myrna is?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.540
I read her articles all the time.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.002
Articles? Miss Phelan,
it's a cleaning advice column.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.963
Eight bucks a week.
Copy is due on Thursday.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.799
Hello?

07:01.129 --> 07:04.804
Lou Ann, honey, I can't talk right now.
I'm at work.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.345
What? Shut that goddamn door.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.030
Mama, we're late for bridge!

07:26.196 --> 07:28.745
Miss Hilly was the first
of the babies to have a baby.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.454
...Three...

07:30.617 --> 07:33.336
And it must have come out of her like
the 11th Commandment,

07:33.495 --> 07:35.748
'cause once Miss Hilly had a baby,

07:35.914 --> 07:38.793
every girl at the bridge table
had to have one, too.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.385
Minny, go get Mama!

07:47.425 --> 07:49.427
Missus Walters,
you need help coming down?

07:49.594 --> 07:51.062
- I'm down.
- Ooh.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.599
- I been down.
- Give me a heart attack.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.894
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Missus Walters.
Here, let me help you.

07:57.060 --> 08:00.030
Take that off.
It's 98 degrees out there.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.656
- Is it?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.488
Well, let's put my coat on then.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.698
- Come on, Minny.
- All right.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.328
- Here's your pocketbook.
- Thank you.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.114
OK, let me get the pie.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.749
Hold on, Missus Walters. Hold on.

08:13.785 --> 08:18.006
Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard,
Miss Hilly moved her into her house

08:18.164 --> 08:20.792
and fired the maid she had
to make room for Minny too.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.930
See, Minny about the best cook
in Mississippi,

08:25.088 --> 08:26.681
and Miss Hilly wanted her.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.395
I lost my own boy, Treelore,
four years ago.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.024
After that, I just didn't want
to live no more.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.937
It took God and Minny
to get me through it.

08:40.937 --> 08:45.443
Minn y my best friend.
Old lady like me lucky to have her.

08:49.529 --> 08:54.581
After my boy died, a bitter seed
was planted inside of me.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.539
And I just didn't feel
so accepting any more.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.227
No.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.731
You drunk up two glasses of grape juice.
I know you got to tee-tee.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.812
No.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.272
I'll give you two cookies if you go.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.863
Mae Mobley, you're going!

09:27.400 --> 09:30.244
Aibileen, the girls are
pulling up, and the table isn't set.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.906
Mae Mobley go, Mama.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.246
Get in your room right now.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.995
Set out the dessert forks. Please.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.301
Put Mama in a chair
before she breaks a hip.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.554
I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.010
Hey, girls.

09:50.173 --> 09:55.680
Oh. Minny. Will you see if Aibileen
has some of that ambrosia?

10:01.017 --> 10:02.769
Hold on. Those are Miss Hilly's.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.065
She looks like the winning
horse at the Kentucky Derby.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.233
All flowers and bows.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.901
Got to have paprika on them.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.615
Ooh.

10:11.778 --> 10:15.157
Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have
to kill that woman, Aibileen.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.202
Now she gone to putting pencil marks
on my toilet paper.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.079
- Did she?
- Mm-hm.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.921
But I carry paper in from my own
damn house. That fool don't know.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.930
Miss Leefolt got so much hairspray
on her head

10:30.088 --> 10:32.307
she gonna blow us all up
if she light a cigarette.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.310
And you know she will!

10:42.308 --> 10:44.151
- You got some ambrosia?
- You know I do.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.857
All right, I'll be back.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.988
Minny, cord, girl.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.737
Shut up.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.411
The Guiding Light.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.325
Hi, Missus Walters.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.831
I'm watching my story.

11:01.703 --> 11:02.750
OK.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.664
Isn't it gorgeous?

11:04.831 --> 11:05.832
Sorry I'm late.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.132
You're home!

11:10.795 --> 11:12.388
I missed you all, too.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.016
Well, if it isn't "Long Haul" Skeeter.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.397
We didn't ever think
you'd leave Ole Miss.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.899
Well, it does take four years, Jolene.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.814
I've got a great summer planned for you.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.196
Great.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.484
I went ahead and I picked up my black
dress from the cleaners this morning.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.404
What?

11:37.405 --> 11:39.828
- About supper club tonight.
- What?

11:41.618 --> 11:43.791
Honey, Stuart had to cancel.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.330
Again?

11:45.496 --> 11:48.215
He got held up on the oil rig, Skeeter.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.672
It's... It's offshore.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.635
I'm starting to think this Stuart
is a figment of your imagination,

11:54.797 --> 11:56.049
so just forget it.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.101
I'm just gonna go get a plate.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.478
- Shh!
- Sorry!

12:07.435 --> 12:08.778
I got a job today.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.490
At The Jackson Journal.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.953
They'd be a fool not to hire you.

12:17.111 --> 12:20.365
To Skeeter and her job.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.283
Last stop till marriage.

12:22.867 --> 12:23.663
Oh!

12:27.789 --> 12:29.917
- It's for the Miss Myrna column.
- Hmm.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.177
Elizabeth, can I talk to Aibileen?

12:32.919 --> 12:36.093
Just to help me with some of the letters
till I get a knack for it.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.017
My Aibileen?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.349
Why can't you just
get Constantine to help?

12:47.558 --> 12:50.027
Constantine quit us.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.689
Oh, my gosh. Skeeter, I'm so sorry.

12:52.855 --> 12:57.110
Anyway, I just, um... I don't really
know how to answer these letters.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.577
Well, I mean, as long as it doesn't
interfere with her work.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.582
I don't see why not.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.792
Leefolt residence.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.927
Hello. Is Elizabeth in?

13:15.086 --> 13:17.555
She having bridge club right now.
May I take a message?

13:17.714 --> 13:21.594
Yes, please tell her Celia Foote
called again.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.478
I'll call back tomorrow.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.685
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh...

13:26.848 --> 13:28.771
Miss?

13:28.933 --> 13:33.279
I'm looking for some help at my house.
Do you know any maids looking?

13:33.438 --> 13:34.610
No, ma'am.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.275
OK. It's Celia Foote.

13:37.442 --> 13:41.117
Emerson-684.
Bye now.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.704
You scared the daylights out of me!

13:50.538 --> 13:54.042
It is lunchtime,
and I am suddenly hungry.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.464
Honestly!

14:04.802 --> 14:06.145
Oh.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.056
I'm still working on it, Aibileen.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.985
Who was that on the phone?

14:13.144 --> 14:15.238
Miss Celia Foote called again.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.441
I've never called her back, Hilly.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.241
She can't take a hint, can she?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.996
Who's Celia Foote?

14:24.155 --> 14:26.157
That tacky girl Johnny married.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.167
From Sugar Ditch.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.873
It could have been you, Hilly.

14:30.036 --> 14:35.384
And live 30 minutes outside of town?
No, thank you.

14:35.541 --> 14:40.468
Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty
parlor, and she had the nerve to ask

14:40.630 --> 14:42.678
if she could help with
the Children's Benefit Ball.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.014
Aren't we taking non-members?
The benefit has gotten so big.

14:46.177 --> 14:49.272
Yes, but we're not telling her.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.567
Thank you, Aibileen.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.866
Hilly, I wish you'd just
go use the bathroom.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.527
I'm fine.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.445
Oh, she's just upset

15:04.612 --> 15:07.365
because the nigra uses the guest bath
and so do we.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.996
Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.254
Yes, ma'am.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.129
Just go use mine and Raleigh's.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.966
If Aibileen uses the guest bath,
I'm sure she uses yours, too.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.472
She does not.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.601
Wouldn't you rather them
take their business outside?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.847
Have you all seen the cover
of Life this week?

15:31.013 --> 15:32.390
Jackie's never looked more regal.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.356
Tell Raleigh every penny he spends
on a colored's bathroom

15:35.518 --> 15:38.362
he'll get back in spades
when y'all sell.

15:39.814 --> 15:43.910
it's just plain dangerous. They carry
different diseases than we do.

15:44.861 --> 15:45.862
Pass.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.157
That's why I've drafted
the Home Health Sanitation Initiative.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.620
The what?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.706
A disease-preventative bill

15:52.869 --> 15:57.295
that requires every white home to have a
separate bathroom for the colored help.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.510
It's been endorsed
by the White Citizens' Council.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.517
Maybe we should just build you
a bathroom outside, Hilly.

16:07.675 --> 16:11.179
You ought not to joke
about the colored situation.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.187
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect our children.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.936
Your lead, Elizabeth.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.200
- Aibileen?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.292
Do you think you'd be willing to help me
with those Miss Myrna letters?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.876
Miss Myrna get it wrong a lot of times.
Be good to get it right.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.134
Thank you, Aibileen.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.142
All that talk in there today...

16:51.552 --> 16:52.804
Hilly's talk?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.436
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.742
Is that Preacher Green's sermon?

17:06.901 --> 17:08.994
Yes, ma'am, it is.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.077
That reminds me so much of my maid,
Constantine.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.744
I know Constantine.
We're in church circle together.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.704
Have you seen her lately?

17:19.997 --> 17:21.294
No, ma'am.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.003
Did you know that she had quit us?

17:23.166 --> 17:24.167
Quit?

17:24.335 --> 17:27.635
I got home from school a week ago,
and my mama told me she had quit.

17:27.797 --> 17:31.597
Back in March, she went to live with
her daughter, Rachel. In Chicago.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.766
Did you hear that?
Do you have her phone number?

17:34.929 --> 17:37.023
There you are, Skeeter.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.519
Hilly wants you to put her initiative
in the League newsletter.

17:41.686 --> 17:42.687
OK.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.865
I'll be back tomorrow, Aibileen,

17:46.023 --> 17:48.617
to get started on those
Miss Myrna letters.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.948
Y'all make it quick.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.455
Tomorrow is silver-polishing day. OK?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.884
Hi, Jameso.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.302
How you, Miss Eugenia?

18:16.387 --> 18:17.388
Mama?

18:21.392 --> 18:22.814
Mama.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.313
Yoo-hoo.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.165
Mama?

18:37.325 --> 18:38.542
Back here, honey!

18:43.748 --> 18:45.466
Is this a little too young?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.127
That's a little too everything.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.218
Oh, hell. You're right.

19:06.937 --> 19:07.984
OK.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.076
Much better.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.447
Your daddy bought me this dress in '58.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.040
Mama, I want to ask you
about Constantine.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.918
Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl.
Come on. You try it on.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.203
What really happened?

19:22.370 --> 19:25.294
Skeeter, your mother is sick.
She wants to see you in this dress.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.457
Unzip me.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.172
Come on.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.048
Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow
got engaged?

19:35.132 --> 19:36.930
After she got that teller job,

19:37.093 --> 19:39.141
her mother said she was swimming
in proposals.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.180
Good for fair Fanny Peatrow.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.601
Eugenia, your eggs are dying.
Would it kill you to go on a date?

19:45.351 --> 19:49.447
Just show a little gumption.
Careful now, careful.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.903
Oh, now look at this.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.820
This dress is just precious on you.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.991
Just take it in a little here.
Little there.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.121
- Get your hair fixed.
- I got a job today.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.288
Where?

20:06.956 --> 20:09.050
Writing for The Jackson Journal.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.674
Great.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.594
You can write my obituary!

20:15.756 --> 20:19.886
"Charlotte Phelan, dead!
Her daughter, still single."

20:20.052 --> 20:22.555
Mother, would it really be so bad
if I never met a husband?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.475
Skeeter! Skeeter!

20:26.517 --> 20:27.939
Skeeter!

20:32.648 --> 20:34.025
I need to ask you something.

20:38.863 --> 20:42.788
I read the other day about how
some girls get unbalanced.

20:43.451 --> 20:44.794
They start thinking these...

20:46.495 --> 20:48.463
...unnatural thoughts.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.965
Are you...

20:51.751 --> 20:56.552
Do you, uh... find men attractive?

20:57.131 --> 21:01.932
Are you having unnatural thoughts
about girls or women?

21:03.679 --> 21:04.771
Oh, my God.

21:04.930 --> 21:09.606
Because this article says there's
a cure. A special root tea!

21:09.769 --> 21:15.151
Mother, I want to be with girls as much
as you want to be with Jameso.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.489
- Eugenia!
- Unless, of course, you do!

21:17.651 --> 21:19.028
Oh!

21:21.155 --> 21:24.625
Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner.
Try to look presentable!

21:28.954 --> 21:31.082
What the hell you know
about cleaning a house, Skeeter?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.967
It's a start, Carlton.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.596
If you say so.
I thought you wanted to write books.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.850
Now, y'all leave Sister alone.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.887
- I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
- The irony of it all.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.351
Giving advice on how to keep up a home
when she doesn't even...

21:46.514 --> 21:49.939
Oh, no, Pascagoula. You couldn't have
known this, but I'm allergic to almonds.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.819
Sorry, Miss Eugenia,
I'll get you another one.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.527
You know, last time I had an almond,
I stopped liking men.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.236
Oh, my Lord.

21:57.399 --> 22:01.154
Oh, no, Rebecca, it's fine. There's
a special root tea for that now.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.663
You have pushed it, young lady.

22:03.364 --> 22:06.493
Daddy. What happened to Constantine?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.957
Uh, well...

22:09.703 --> 22:13.048
Constantine went to live in Chicago
with her family.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.710
People move on, Skeeter.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.254
But I do wish that she'd
stayed down here with us.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.977
I don't believe you.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.185
She would've written and told me.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.151
Did you fire her?

22:40.818 --> 22:44.948
We were just a job to her, honey.
With them, it's all about money.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.618
You'll understand that once you've
hired help of your own.

22:49.410 --> 22:52.254
- She raised me.
- She did not!

22:52.413 --> 22:55.007
She worked here for 29 years!

22:55.165 --> 22:57.384
It was a colored thing
and I put it behind me!

22:58.127 --> 23:01.927
Excuse me a moment, Rebecca. My daughter
has upset my cancerous ulcers.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.100
What you doing hiding out here, girl?

23:52.765 --> 23:56.144
I couldn't tell Mama I didn't
get asked to the dance.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.436
It's all right.

23:58.646 --> 24:02.150
Some things we just got to
keep to ourselves, right?

24:03.233 --> 24:05.076
All the boys say I'm ugly.

24:06.946 --> 24:11.042
Mama was third runner-up in
the Miss South Carolina pageant.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.875
I wish you'd quit
feeling sorry for yourself.

24:15.037 --> 24:17.165
Now, that's ugly.

24:18.207 --> 24:21.757
Ugly is something that
goes up inside you.

24:21.919 --> 24:25.389
It's mean and hurtful, like them boys.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.513
Now you're not one of them, is you?

24:29.551 --> 24:31.474
I didn't think so, honey.

24:36.684 --> 24:37.685
Every day...

24:39.687 --> 24:42.486
Every day you're not
dead in the ground,

24:42.648 --> 24:47.245
when you wake up in the morning, you're
gonna have to make some decisions.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.119
Got to ask yourself this question:

24:51.824 --> 24:53.417
"Am I gonna believe

24:53.575 --> 24:58.251
all them bad things them fools
say about me today?"

25:00.207 --> 25:01.299
You hear me?

25:01.458 --> 25:04.587
"Am I gonna believe all them bad things

25:04.753 --> 25:07.256
them fools say about me today'?"

25:10.134 --> 25:11.260
All right?

25:14.430 --> 25:18.276
As for your mama,
she didn't pick her life.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.070
It picked her.

25:23.856 --> 25:24.982
But you...

25:27.735 --> 25:31.410
...you're gonna do
something big with yours.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.124
You wait and see.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.463
Come on, go home with me
till the dance over. Come on.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.779
Miss Stein, you said in your letter
to write about what disturbs me,

26:03.937 --> 26:05.234
particularly if it bothers no one else.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.398
Come on.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.363
And I understand that now.

26:09.777 --> 26:10.949
Continue.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.748
I'd like to write something
from the point of view of the help.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.832
These colored women
raise white children,

26:18.994 --> 26:22.294
and in 20 years,
those children become the boss.

26:22.456 --> 26:25.175
We love them and they love us,

26:25.334 --> 26:27.632
but they can't even use the toilets
in our houses.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.388
Don't you find that ironic, Miss Stein?

26:29.546 --> 26:30.547
I'm listening.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.685
Margaret Mitchell glorified
the mammy figure,

26:34.843 --> 26:36.516
who dedicates her whole life

26:36.678 --> 26:37.725
to a white family.

26:37.888 --> 26:41.267
But nobody ever asked Mammy
how she felt about it.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.186
So, a side to this never before heard?

26:44.353 --> 26:46.276
Yes.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.282
'Cause nobody ever really
talks about it down here.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.909
Skeeter, who are you
talking to in there?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.290
Go away!

26:59.910 --> 27:02.880
- Who was that?
- My mother.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.585
Look.

27:04.748 --> 27:08.218
No maid in her right mind is ever gonna
tell you the truth.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.927
That's a hell of a risk to take in
a place like Jackson, Mississippi.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.466
I already have a maid.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.971
Really? A Negro maid has already agreed
to speak with you?

27:19.805 --> 27:21.352
Yes, ma'am.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.189
Well... I guess I can read
what you come up with.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.528
The book biz could use
a little rattling.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.068
Thank you, Miss Stein.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.986
Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying

27:34.153 --> 27:37.123
is that I'll let you know
if it's even worth pursuing.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.706
And for God's sake, you're
a 23-year-old educated woman.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.041
Go get yourself an apartment.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.047
"Dear Miss Myrna:

27:50.002 --> 27:52.676
When I'm chopping onions, how do I
keep tears out of my eyes?"

27:52.838 --> 27:56.433
Shoot, that's easy. You tell
her hold a matchstick between her teeth.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.432
Is it lit?

27:59.595 --> 28:01.222
No, ma'am.

28:03.557 --> 28:06.606
Miss Leefolt said
you could start right away.

28:06.768 --> 28:11.740
Build it just like the bathroom
at my house. Let's see.

28:11.899 --> 28:15.529
- Right there. That will be nice.
- Yes, ma'am.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.377
My goodness, we got to run back
to the car. Come on.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.288
Bye, Skeeter!

28:28.874 --> 28:30.467
Aibileen.

28:30.626 --> 28:34.256
There's something else I want to
write about. I would need your help.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.520
I want to interview you about
what it's like to work as a maid.

28:41.678 --> 28:44.978
I'd like to do a book of interviews
about working for white families.

28:45.807 --> 28:49.528
And we could show what it's like
to work for, say, Elizabeth?

28:49.686 --> 28:52.940
You know what Miss Leefolt do to me if
she knew I was telling stories on her?

28:53.106 --> 28:56.235
I was thinking that we wouldn't
have to tell her.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.280
The other maids would have
to keep it a secret, too.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.789
Other maids?

29:02.241 --> 29:04.619
I was hoping to get four or five.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.294
To show what it's really like
in Jackson.

29:12.417 --> 29:17.298
Show what y'all get paid,
and the babies and the bathrooms.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.681
The good and the bad.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.219
I bought you this damn house.
I put up with your new clothes

29:22.386 --> 29:24.935
and trips to New Orleans,
but this takes the goddamn cake.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.314
Hilly spoke to the surgeon general,

29:26.473 --> 29:29.192
and she also said it'll add value
to our home.

29:29.351 --> 29:32.195
I guess Mae Mobley can go to college
in that damn bathroom!

29:32.354 --> 29:33.606
Hilly's covering the cost and said

29:33.772 --> 29:35.615
you could just do William's taxes
to pay her back.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.822
We don't take orders
from the Holbrooks.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.614
Skeeter, how you doing?

29:44.074 --> 29:45.075
Fine.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.006
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.587
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's
crying her eyes out.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.426
Skeeter.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.930
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
if you leave now.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.894
Oh, sure, sure.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.811
And this Miss Myrna thing isn't going
to work out with Aibileen.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.738
I'm sorry.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.874
You're making it hotter,
flapping your arms like that, Minny.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.764
Look how big the waves are, Minny.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.595
Let's go to the beach.
Run, get Mr. Walters!

30:45.761 --> 30:47.479
He loves riding these waves!

30:47.637 --> 30:49.935
You know we went to Biloxi
on our honeymoon?

30:50.098 --> 30:51.566
Yes, ma'am.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.400
Are we in Biloxi, Minny?

30:56.563 --> 30:59.567
No, ma'am. We ain't.

31:02.944 --> 31:06.915
Why don't you sit down here for a spell.

31:08.116 --> 31:12.872
And then me and you will go on down
to the beach in a little while.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.381
How about that?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.265
Uh...

31:29.179 --> 31:30.180
Miss Hilly?

31:30.347 --> 31:31.940
Mm-hm?

31:34.476 --> 31:35.773
Never mind.

31:35.936 --> 31:38.815
You go on ahead and use
the inside bath, Minny, it's all right.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.904
Oh, for crying out loud,
it's just a little rain.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.617
She can go on up and get an umbrella
from William's study.

31:46.279 --> 31:50.034
I believe she was working for me
before you dragged us both here.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.793
Daddy ruined you.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.128
I'm just gonna get your tea.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.332
Minny?

32:32.701 --> 32:34.374
Minny, are you in there?

32:36.413 --> 32:37.756
Yes, ma'am.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.835
And just what are you doing?

32:48.717 --> 32:50.390
Get off my toilet!

32:55.599 --> 32:58.193
You are fired, Minny Jackson!

33:09.988 --> 33:11.740
Go on!

33:21.249 --> 33:23.923
Eighteen people
died in Jackson that day.

33:25.212 --> 33:27.180
Ten white and eight black.

33:31.259 --> 33:35.639
God don't pay no mind to color once
He decide to set a tornado loose.

33:35.805 --> 33:38.729
Aibee's here, honey.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.439
Aibee's here.

34:02.249 --> 34:05.423
Hurry, Aibileen! Mae Mobley
is up, and I'm off to the doctor!

34:10.340 --> 34:14.561
That's Aibee's bathroom, Mama.
Hey, Aibee!

34:14.719 --> 34:17.188
No, no, no, honey.
Promise me you won't go in there, OK?

34:17.347 --> 34:18.643
Yes, ma'am.

34:19.181 --> 34:20.684
I'm right here, Baby Girl.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.105
Isn't it so nice
to have your own, Aibileen?

34:25.272 --> 34:26.398
Yes, ma'am.

34:41.830 --> 34:45.425
You're my real mama, Aibee.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.286
- Is that Minny?
- Minny.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.872
Hey, Aibileen!

35:16.573 --> 35:17.574
Hey, Minny!

35:17.741 --> 35:19.584
Mm-hmm.

35:19.743 --> 35:20.915
Where you headed?

35:22.287 --> 35:25.336
I got some business to tend to,
so y'all just mind your own.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.967
All right, then. Well, bye!

35:28.126 --> 35:29.924
Bye!

35:30.086 --> 35:32.760
Now is she mad at me 'cause I got
that job at Miss Hilly's?

35:32.922 --> 35:35.596
Don't worry about her.
She always mad about something.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.058
Aibileen.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.643
Yes, ma'am. Everything OK?

35:44.809 --> 35:46.937
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

35:47.896 --> 35:50.149
You got some more
Miss Myrna questions for me?

35:50.315 --> 35:51.988
Oh, no, I just wanted to talk about...

35:55.862 --> 35:58.285
We never finished our conversation
at Elizabeth's.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.667
About that book I want to write?

36:15.548 --> 36:18.392
I'd really like
to interview you, Aibileen.

36:19.386 --> 36:20.683
I know it's scary.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.644
They set my cousin
Shinelle's car on fire,

36:27.811 --> 36:29.859
just 'cause she went down
to the voting station.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.274
A book like this has never
been written before.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.113
'Cause there's a reason.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.119
I do this with you, I might as well
burn my own house down.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.575
I promise we'll be careful.

36:38.738 --> 36:41.207
This already ain't careful,
Miss Skeeter!

36:46.454 --> 36:49.173
You not knowing that is what's
scaring me the most.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.426
Scare me more than Jim Crow.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.467
All right.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.883
Here's my phone number.

37:01.511 --> 37:04.811
- My car's here. I could take you home.
- No, ma'am.

37:16.359 --> 37:20.159
"No person shall
require any white female

37:20.321 --> 37:24.747
to nurse in wards or rooms
in which Negro men are placed.

37:26.745 --> 37:32.093
Books shall not be interchangeable
between the white and colored schools,

37:33.293 --> 37:37.298
but shall continue to be used
by the race first using them.

37:39.632 --> 37:44.934
No colored barber shall serve as
a barber to white women or girls.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.234
Any person printing, publishing

37:49.392 --> 37:51.235
or circulating written matter

37:51.394 --> 37:56.651
urging for public acceptance or social
equality between whites and Negroes

37:56.816 --> 37:58.944
is subject to imprisonment. "

38:00.153 --> 38:01.200
Hello?

38:01.362 --> 38:04.536
Aibileen, I done went and did it now.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.623
I went to Miss Hilly's house
this afternoon.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.288
Why Minny?

38:09.454 --> 38:12.754
She done told every white woman
in town I'm a thief

38:12.916 --> 38:15.385
Said I stole a candelabra.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.172
But I got her back.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.012
What you did?

38:22.342 --> 38:23.685
I can't tell you.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.055
I ain 't telling nobody.

38:31.434 --> 38:35.280
I done something terrible awful
to that woman,

38:35.438 --> 38:38.032
and now she know what I done.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.488
Sorry.

38:43.780 --> 38:44.781
Minny.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.950
She got what she deserved, Aibileen.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.912
But now I ain't gonna never get
no job again.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.170
Oh, Lord, Leroy gonna kill me.

39:01.381 --> 39:02.382
Leroy?

39:04.717 --> 39:06.469
What you done did now, Minny?

39:08.054 --> 39:10.398
- Get off that phone, woman!
- Leroy, please!

39:10.557 --> 39:13.106
Minny? Minny!

39:13.268 --> 39:15.487
Please! Please!

39:15.645 --> 39:16.771
Come here!

39:25.071 --> 39:28.996
Please open your Bibles to Exodus.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.412
Chapter four, verse ten.

39:32.912 --> 39:37.463
God, having asked Moses
to free the Israelites...

39:39.252 --> 39:40.845
...Moses answered:

39:42.213 --> 39:46.559
"Oh, my Lord. I am not eloquent.

39:47.427 --> 39:51.682
I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."

39:54.225 --> 39:58.605
See, courage isn't just
about being brave.

39:58.771 --> 39:59.818
Amen!

39:59.981 --> 40:02.200
Courage is daring to do what is right

40:02.442 --> 40:05.286
in spite of the weakness of our flesh.

40:05.445 --> 40:07.823
And God tells us,

40:08.531 --> 40:11.284
commands us, compels us,

40:11.451 --> 40:13.704
- to love. Amen?
- Amen.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.582
See, love,

40:17.749 --> 40:21.379
as exemplified
by our Lord Jesus Christ,

40:21.544 --> 40:25.390
is to be prepared to put yourself
in harm's way

40:25.548 --> 40:27.516
...for your fellow man.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.973
And by your fellow man,
I mean your brother,

40:30.345 --> 40:34.976
your sister, your neighbor,
your friend and your enemy.

40:35.141 --> 40:39.146
If you can love your enemy,
you already have the victory.

40:39.312 --> 40:41.406
Let's stand. All right.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.299
Quick. Come quick.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.716
I parked way up on State Street and
caught a cab here, like you asked.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.384
Got dropped two streets over?

41:09.550 --> 41:11.018
Mm-hm.

41:25.108 --> 41:28.453
I know now that it's against the law,
what we're doing.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.792
I've never seen you
out of uniform before.

41:39.455 --> 41:41.253
You look really nice.

41:42.375 --> 41:43.592
Thank you.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.738
I ain't never had no white person
in my house before.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.360
Miss Skeeter...

42:11.112 --> 42:15.788
...what if you don't like what I
got to say... about white people?

42:17.410 --> 42:19.128
This isn't about me.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.381
It doesn't matter how I feel.

42:30.757 --> 42:33.931
You gonna have to change my name.
Mine, Miss Leefolt's. Everybody.

42:35.428 --> 42:37.476
Do you have other maids
that are interested?

42:39.390 --> 42:41.392
That gonna be hard.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.232
What about Minny?

42:43.394 --> 42:44.987
Minny got her some stories,
sure enough,

42:45.146 --> 42:48.992
but she ain't real keen on talking
to white peoples right now.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.747
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

42:54.906 --> 42:57.785
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

43:00.620 --> 43:02.167
It feel...

43:14.550 --> 43:15.767
Is that your son?

43:20.932 --> 43:22.809
Yes, ma'am.

43:22.975 --> 43:25.148
Can we move on to the next question?

43:25.311 --> 43:28.190
You don't have to call me ma'am.

43:28.773 --> 43:30.775
Not here.

43:36.739 --> 43:37.786
Uh...

43:37.949 --> 43:40.372
Do you want to talk about the bathroom?

43:41.202 --> 43:44.172
Or anything about Miss Leefolt?

43:45.164 --> 43:49.795
How she pays you, or has she ever
yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley?

43:54.215 --> 43:57.560
I thought I might write my stories down
and read them to you.

43:58.261 --> 44:00.355
Ain't no different than writing down
my prayers.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.730
OK.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.317
Sure.

44:15.695 --> 44:18.164
I don't say my prayers out loud.

44:18.322 --> 44:21.496
I can get my point across
a lot better writing them down.

44:21.659 --> 44:26.711
I write an hour,
sometimes two, every night.

44:26.873 --> 44:31.549
And after my prayers last night,
I got some stories down, too.

44:34.839 --> 44:36.136
Go ahead.

44:45.766 --> 44:48.861
"My first white baby to ever look after

44:49.020 --> 44:52.240
was named Alton Carrington Speers.

44:52.398 --> 44:56.448
It was 1925, and I had just turned 14.

44:57.111 --> 45:00.160
I dropped out of school
to help Mama with the bills.

45:00.323 --> 45:02.917
Alton's mama died of lung disease."

45:06.537 --> 45:10.462
I loved that baby. And he loved me.

45:12.919 --> 45:16.014
That's when I learned I could make
children feel proud of theyself.

45:18.716 --> 45:22.186
Alton used to always be asking me
how come I was black.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.393
Just ate him up.

45:24.555 --> 45:28.435
And one time, I told him it was because
I drank too much coffee.

45:32.688 --> 45:35.316
You should have seen his face.

45:47.703 --> 45:50.297
This was just so great.

45:52.291 --> 45:55.591
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
your doing this with me.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.555
What changed your mind?

46:00.258 --> 46:01.384
God.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.520
And Miss Hilly Holbrook.

46:18.734 --> 46:23.410
Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you
and Mr. William something.

46:26.867 --> 46:30.917
My twin boys graduated from high school,
both on the honor roll.

46:31.580 --> 46:35.050
Me and my husband, we been saving
for years to send them to Tougaloo.

46:37.044 --> 46:40.173
We're short about $75
on one of the tuitions.

46:42.216 --> 46:47.188
Whoo! I am late. I gotta get going.

46:50.141 --> 46:51.358
See you tonight, honey.

46:51.517 --> 46:52.564
OK.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.105
Go on.

46:59.608 --> 47:02.487
Well, now we're...

47:02.653 --> 47:05.372
...faced with having to choose

47:05.531 --> 47:08.159
which son can go if we don't
come up with the money.

47:09.368 --> 47:11.996
Would you consider giving us a loan?

47:12.747 --> 47:17.969
I'd work every day for free
till it was paid off.

47:18.127 --> 47:22.132
That's not working for free.
That's paying off a debt.

47:24.633 --> 47:26.135
Yes, ma'am.

47:30.056 --> 47:34.311
As a Christian, I'm doing you a favor.

47:36.062 --> 47:40.283
See, God don't give charity to those
who are well and able.

47:41.442 --> 47:45.242
You need to come up with this money
on your own. OK?

47:47.448 --> 47:49.496
Yes, ma'am.

47:49.658 --> 47:51.126
You'll thank me one day.

47:53.662 --> 47:57.007
You cooking white food,
you taste it with a different spoon.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.878
If they see you put the tasting spoon
back in the pot,

48:00.044 --> 48:01.387
might as well throw it all out.

48:01.545 --> 48:02.717
Spoon, too.

48:02.880 --> 48:06.100
And you use the same cup, same fork,
same plate every day.

48:06.258 --> 48:07.851
And you put it up in the cabinet.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.729
You tell that white woman that's where
you're gonna keep it from now on out.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.686
Don't do it and see what happens.

48:12.848 --> 48:14.521
Morning, ladies.

48:14.683 --> 48:16.356
When you're sewing white folks coffee,

48:16.519 --> 48:17.816
set it down in front of them.

48:17.978 --> 48:20.652
Don't hand it to them,
'cause your hands can't touch.

48:21.440 --> 48:24.159
And don't hit on they children.

48:24.318 --> 48:26.867
White folks like to do
they own spanking.

48:28.155 --> 48:30.658
And last thing. Come here.

48:31.951 --> 48:33.168
Look at me.

48:33.327 --> 48:35.671
No Sass-mouthing.

48:37.790 --> 48:40.168
No Sass-mouthing.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.052
I mean it.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.601
Give your mama a kiss.

48:51.262 --> 48:55.768
Leroy had made Sugar quit
school to help him with the bills.

48:59.645 --> 49:03.070
And every day Minny
went without a job,

49:03.232 --> 49:05.985
might have been a day Leroy
took her from our world.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.200
Good morning, everybody.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.378
But I knew.

49:20.541 --> 49:24.842
I knew the only white lady Miss Hilly
hadn't gotten to with her lies.

49:33.220 --> 49:34.938
Hey!

49:35.097 --> 49:38.146
Come on!

49:38.309 --> 49:42.780
No sass-mouthing, Minny Jackson.
No Sass-mouthing.

49:44.690 --> 49:47.318
Aibileen said you'd be on time.

49:51.572 --> 49:53.449
I'm Celia Rae Foote.

49:53.616 --> 49:55.289
I'm Minny Jackson.

49:56.911 --> 49:59.960
You, uh... cooking something?

50:01.165 --> 50:04.590
One of those upside-down cakes
from a magazine.

50:04.752 --> 50:08.507
It ain't working out too good.
Come on, let's get you a cold Coca-Cola.

50:11.217 --> 50:12.218
Come on.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.393
This here is the kitchen.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.938
What in the hell?

50:23.312 --> 50:25.735
I guess I got some learning to do.

50:26.482 --> 50:29.531
You sure do.

50:29.693 --> 50:32.742
Johnny's grandmama left him this house
when she died.

50:32.905 --> 50:35.909
And then Johnny's mama
wouldn't let me change a thing.

50:36.075 --> 50:38.077
But if I had it my way,

50:38.244 --> 50:43.125
this place would be wall-to-wall
white carpet with gold trim.

50:43.290 --> 50:45.463
None of this old stuff.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.924
The main house has
five beds and baths,

50:48.087 --> 50:52.388
and then the pool house has
two more beds and baths.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.723
When y'all gonna start
having some children,

50:54.885 --> 50:56.979
filling up all these empty beds?

50:59.139 --> 51:01.767
- I'm pregnant now.
- Oh.

51:01.934 --> 51:05.438
Gonna be eating for two.
That's double the cooking.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.359
I know. It's an awful lotto do.

51:10.401 --> 51:13.496
Five other maids have
already turned me down.

51:14.488 --> 51:17.116
Let me at least get you some bus money.

51:17.283 --> 51:20.708
Now, uh... when did you hear me say
I don't want to clean this house?

51:21.954 --> 51:25.208
Wait. So you'll do it?

51:31.755 --> 51:33.473
Ooh. No hugging. No hugging.

51:34.633 --> 51:38.979
I'm sorry. This is the first time
I've hired a maid.

51:39.888 --> 51:41.435
Come on.

51:47.688 --> 51:51.158
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am. Hold on a minute.

51:51.317 --> 51:53.365
We gots to talk about
some things first.

51:55.529 --> 51:57.406
Oh.

51:57.573 --> 51:59.200
I work Sunday through Friday.

51:59.366 --> 52:02.370
No, you can't work at all
on the weekends.

52:02.536 --> 52:05.915
OK. What time you want me here?

52:07.082 --> 52:10.928
After 9:00, and you gotta leave
before 4:00.

52:12.087 --> 52:13.259
OK.

52:13.422 --> 52:15.140
Now...

52:15.299 --> 52:16.892
What your husband say you can pay?

52:18.552 --> 52:20.646
Johnny doesn't know
I'm bringing in help.

52:20.804 --> 52:22.898
And what Mr. Johnny gonna do
when he come home

52:23.057 --> 52:25.230
and find a colored woman in his house?

52:25.392 --> 52:28.191
It's not like I'd be fibbing.

52:28.354 --> 52:30.777
I just want him to think I can do this
on my own.

52:32.858 --> 52:35.236
I really need a maid.

52:37.237 --> 52:39.615
I'll be here tomorrow morning
about 9:15.

52:41.742 --> 52:42.868
Great.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.549
- Miss Celia?
- Hmm?

52:49.124 --> 52:51.001
I think you done burned up your cake.

52:54.088 --> 52:55.431
Doggone it!

53:01.345 --> 53:03.848
- OK, let's see.
- What's first up on the agenda?

53:04.973 --> 53:10.150
We are running behind on our coat drive.
Hurry up and clean out those closets.

53:10.312 --> 53:15.364
But our Christmas benefit, however,
is right on schedule. Mary Beth?

53:16.568 --> 53:21.290
Well, thanks to y'all, I can announce
that we already filled

53:21.448 --> 53:24.497
every raffle slot for baked goods!

53:26.912 --> 53:30.416
Think we can put a dent in
African children's hunger this year?

53:31.500 --> 53:33.594
A big dent!

53:36.880 --> 53:37.881
Now...

53:38.048 --> 53:40.676
...I just found out
the surgeon general

53:40.843 --> 53:44.222
has reviewed the Home Health
Sanitation Initiative that I drafted,

53:44.388 --> 53:48.393
and he passed it along
to Governor Barnett!

53:49.143 --> 53:52.568
Skeeter, when can we expect to see
the initiative in the newsletter?

53:52.730 --> 53:54.403
I gave it to you a month ago.

53:54.565 --> 53:56.488
I gave that to you myself.

53:56.650 --> 53:59.620
Would you please stand, Skeeter?

54:04.491 --> 54:06.414
I'll have it in there real soon.

54:09.413 --> 54:10.665
Great.

54:19.006 --> 54:21.384
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

54:29.308 --> 54:30.309
Thanks.

54:35.355 --> 54:38.575
Hilly, I really am sorry
about the newsletter.

54:38.734 --> 54:41.032
It's just with Mama being sick and all.

54:42.988 --> 54:44.706
Oh, it's fine.

54:47.075 --> 54:49.419
I made you the egg and olive on rye,
Miss Skeeter.

54:49.578 --> 54:51.956
Oh, thank you, Henry.

54:52.122 --> 54:53.624
You remembered.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.134
You're welcome.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.630
Oh, Hilly, tell her.
I can hardly stand it.

55:00.506 --> 55:03.100
He's coming.

55:03.258 --> 55:06.683
Oh, Skeeter, Stuart's definitely
coming this time. Next Saturday week.

55:06.845 --> 55:11.601
Well, he's canceled twice before.
Don't you think maybe that's a sign?

55:11.767 --> 55:14.111
Don't you dare say that.

55:14.269 --> 55:16.021
You know I'm not gonna be his type.

55:16.188 --> 55:18.407
Damn it, Skeeter, I'm not gonna
let you miss out on this

55:18.565 --> 55:21.785
because your mother convinced you you're
not good enough for somebody like him.

55:25.823 --> 55:27.666
Saturday night.

56:05.821 --> 56:08.495
Good morning.

56:08.657 --> 56:11.581
Good morning, Baby Girl.

56:11.743 --> 56:14.041
Good morning.

56:26.508 --> 56:28.806
I reckon I'm ready to talk about
Miss Leefolt now.

56:31.889 --> 56:35.063
Baby Girl still gotta wear a diaper
when she sleep at night.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.478
And it don't get changed till
I get there in the morning.

56:37.644 --> 56:40.488
That about ten hours
she gotta sleep in her mess.

56:41.815 --> 56:44.409
Now Miss Leefolt pregnant
with her second baby.

56:45.235 --> 56:48.580
Lord... I pray this child
turn out good.

56:49.489 --> 56:52.288
It's a lonely road if a mama
don't think their child is pretty.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.088
That's very true.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.927
Miss Leefolt should not
be having babies.

57:07.382 --> 57:08.508
Write that down.

57:15.641 --> 57:18.315
Treelore would like me doing this.

57:18.477 --> 57:21.276
He always said we were gonna have
a writer in the family one day.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.861
I always thought it was gonna be him.
Maybe it's gonna be me.

57:24.942 --> 57:26.910
Aibileen, Aibileen.

57:27.069 --> 57:29.868
They done set a bomb off
in Medgar Evers' carport.

57:38.372 --> 57:42.172
Yule Mae told me what y'all was up to.
I didn't want to believe it.

57:44.962 --> 57:48.011
And just what makes you think
colored people need your help?

57:49.132 --> 57:50.725
- Why do you care?
- Minny.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.682
Maybe you just want
to get Aibileen in trouble.

57:52.844 --> 57:54.437
No.

57:54.596 --> 57:56.974
I want to show her perspective.

57:57.140 --> 58:00.815
So people might understand
what it's like from your side.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.652
Well, it's a real Fourth of July picnic.

58:04.231 --> 58:07.485
It's what we dream of doing
all weekend long.

58:07.651 --> 58:10.404
Get back into they house,
polish the silver.

58:10.570 --> 58:15.167
And we just love not making minimum wage
or getting Social Security.

58:17.119 --> 58:20.043
And how we love they children
when they little.

58:20.872 --> 58:24.001
And then they turn out
just like they mamas.

58:24.167 --> 58:25.214
I know.

58:27.254 --> 58:28.756
Maybe things can change.

58:28.922 --> 58:31.016
What law's gonna say you
gotta be nice to your maid?

58:31.174 --> 58:32.721
You don't have to do this now, Minny.

58:32.884 --> 58:34.511
You damn right I don't!

58:35.345 --> 58:37.393
You two give me the heart palpitations.

58:41.893 --> 58:42.985
And that's a good mood.

58:55.115 --> 58:57.538
All right. I'm gonna do it.

58:57.701 --> 59:01.672
But I need to make sure she understands
this ain't no game we playing here.

59:03.707 --> 59:06.335
Slide your chair out from under
that table. Face me.

59:09.129 --> 59:12.884
I need to see you square on
at all times.

59:22.601 --> 59:24.194
I gotta come up with
your questions, too?

59:24.352 --> 59:25.444
Oh.

59:26.813 --> 59:31.034
Uh, let's begin
with where you were born.

59:31.193 --> 59:34.948
Belzoni, Mississippi,
on my great-auntie's sofa.

59:35.113 --> 59:36.239
Next.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.750
- I put the green beans in first.
- OK.

59:38.909 --> 59:42.038
Then I get on the pork chops so I can
get started on that cornbread.

59:42.204 --> 59:45.708
Once Minny got to talking
about food, she liked to never stop.

59:47.459 --> 59:51.180
And when she got to talking about
the white ladies, it took all night.

59:51.338 --> 59:55.844
Then she say, "Oh, Minny,
I'm gonna give you a paid vacation."

59:56.009 --> 59:58.558
I ain't never had no paid vacation
in my life.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.314
A week later I come back,
and they done moved to Mobile.

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:05.902
Miss Lazy Fingers scared I'd find
a new job before she moved.

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:08.109
Ain't that right, Aibileen?

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:15.446
We gots to get some more maids.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.957
It hard. You go try and see.

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:22.745
OK, I will.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.586
We gone and done it now.

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:38.348
Skeeter! Get down here! Something just
arrived from New York for you.

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:54.943
What is that?

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:58.785
The Shinalator.
All the way from New York City.

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:02.493
I'm a good mother.
Come on. Sit down.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:09.299
The whole system cost 11 dollars.
Even smells expensive.

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:14.384
You're gonna look beautiful
on your date tonight.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:16.890
I can feel the hope in your fingers.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.887
Holy shit.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:24.647
- You shrunk five inches.
- Oh, my God.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.854
You'll be able to wear heels tonight.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:31.029
You're not leaving the house in those
awful Mexican man shoes.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.280
Can I take the Cadillac?

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.862
We promised the Cadillac
to Carlton and Rebecca tonight,

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:38.154
so William's cousin will just
have to come pick you up himself.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.914
- I'll take the truck.
- It's hooked up to the motor grader.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:42.073
I'll drive slow.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.993
Skeeter! Skeeter!

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.007
Now remember, no gentleman wants
to spend the evening with a sourpuss.

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:53.419
Don't mope! Smile!

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:58.933
And for heaven's sakes, don't sit like
some squaw Indian! Cross your ankles!

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:01.601
I love you!

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.654
Stuart, she'll be here any minute.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.486
Hey.-

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:19.160
Skeeter.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:25.538
Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk
about quarterbacks or something.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.498
Yule Mae, get Miss Skeeter a Coca-Cola.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:28.833
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.052
Want a drink?

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.017
Just water, please.

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:51.443
Double Old Kentucky, straight
with a water back. Make that two backs.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.480
You sure you don't want to just make it
the whole bottle and a straw?

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.946
Honey, there's the lieutenant governor.
Let's go say hi.

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.907
Good to see you, sir.
You remember my wife?

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:06.290
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:14.671
So, what do you do with your time?

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:16.881
You work?

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:19.091
I write.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.633
But right now I'm working on
a domestic maintenance column

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:23.891
for The Jackson Journal.

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:27.183
You mean housekeeping.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:31.896
Jesus, I can't think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column,

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.901
except for maybe writing one.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.607
Well, I can.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.866
Working with a bunch of greasy,
stinky men in the middle of the ocean.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:43.529
It sounds like a ploy to find a husband,
becoming an expert in keeping house.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:47.325
Well, aren't you a genius?
You figured out my whole scheme.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.710
Isn't that what all you girls
from Ole Miss major in...

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:52.587
...professional husband hunting?

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:55.670
Who is hungry?

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:59.427
I'm sorry, but were you dropped
on your head as an infant?

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.179
Or were you just born stupid?

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.074
So, what can you cook?

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:29.663
Oh, um, I can cook cornpone.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:32.327
Boil potatoes.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.462
I can do grits.

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:39.046
Well...

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:43.884
...I reckon if there's anything you
ought to know about cooking, it's this.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:47.142
The most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.270
You got gum in your hair,

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:53.648
you got a squeaky door hinge...

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:54.808
Crisco.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.186
How pretty.

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:02.028
Looks like frosting.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:05.069
You got bags under your eyes.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.203
Want to soften your husband's
scaly feet.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.948
Mm-hm. Crisco.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:14.415
But it's best for frying chicken.

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:17.335
Frying chicken just...

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.592
...tend to make you
feel better about life.

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:25.551
At least me, anyway.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.597
Mm, I love me some fried chicken.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:32.269
Now...

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.306
...shake that.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:36.975
Oh.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.657
This is so much fun!

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:49.537
All right, all right.
The chicken already dead, Miss Celia.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.660
Yep. He dead.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:07.180
There you are.

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:13.387
I'm starved. Looks so good.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:15.646
We done been over this, Miss Celia.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:19.685
You supposed to eat in the dining room.
That's how it works.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:21.023
Let me take your plate back.

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:23.780
I'm fine right here, Minny.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:44.292
What?

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:47.971
I just want you to know
I'm real grateful you're here.

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:50.882
You gots plenty more
to be grateful for than me.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.645
And look, now I ain't
messing around no more.

01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:57.100
Now Mr. Johnny gonna catch me here,

01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:00.107
and shoot me dead right here
on this no-wax floor.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.231
You gots to tell him.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:05.237
Ain't he wondering how
the cooking's so good?

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:07.023
You're right.

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.860
Maybe we ought to
burn the chicken a little.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.619
Minny don't burn chicken.

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:20.955
I like this Sarah Ross. She testifies
without complaining too much.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.750
And that Bertha,
she's got chutzpah, I'll give her that.

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:26.259
So you liked it?

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:29.045
Eugenia, Martin Luther King
just invited

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:32.182
the entire country to march with him
in D.C. in August.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.683
This many Negroes and whites

01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:36.219
have not worked together since
Gone with the Wind.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:39.139
How many stories have you
recorded thus far?

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.307
The ones you've read.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:43.317
Two domestics, that's all?

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.485
I'm real close to
getting more interviews.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:51.652
Don't send me anything else
until you do have more maids.

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:54.662
Yes, ma'am. How... how many more?

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:57.700
I don't know. At least a dozen.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:08:01.210
My advice to you is to write it
and write it fast

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:03.713
before this whole civil rights thing
blows over.

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:05.544
Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.059
We need a dozen more.

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:25.143
Me and Aibileen done asked everybody
we know. Thirty-one maids.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.108
They all too scared. Think we crazy.

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:32.109
If we don't get more,
we're not getting published.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.245
I gots plenty stories,
Miss Skeeter.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:38.997
Just write them down
and invent the maid that said it.

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:41.706
You're already making up names.
Just make up the maids, too.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:45.792
We're not gonna do that.
That would be wrong.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.298
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.084
It wouldn't be real.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.174
They Killed my son.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.221
He fell carrying two-by-fours
at the mill.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.979
Truck run over him, crushed his lung.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.734
Aibileen.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.817
That white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.488
Drove to the colored hospital...

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.622
...dumped him there and honked the horn.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:34.304
There was nothing they could do,
so I brought my baby home.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.303
Laid him down on that sofa right there.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.933
He died right in front of me.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:53.149
He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.
Best part of a person's life.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:58.369
Anniversary of his death comes...

01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:00.906
...every year, and I can't breathe.

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:03.291
But to y'all, it's just
another day of bridge.

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.213
You stop this...

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:14.298
...everything I wrote, he wrote,
everything he was is gonna die with him.

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:27.732
I am just honored
to be hosting Elizabeth's shower.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.109
Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:32.737
Yes, she does!

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.318
Honey, you hold on to it,
to the bitter end.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:39.031
- I'll try.
- Well, congratulations.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.164
I'm hungry, Mommy.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:44.494
She's always hungry.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.086
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:53.500
I'll cut you
a piece of cake, baby. Go on, now.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:02.392
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's'?

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:06.305
Nice to have your own.
Isn't it, Aibileen?

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.150
Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:16.986
Separate, but equal.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:20.113
That's what Ross Barnett says,
and you can't argue with the governor.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:24.497
Well, certainly not in Mississippi,
the birthplace of modern-day government.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:44.263
Hey, Miss Skeeter.
Can I get you something?

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:45.426
No, thanks.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:49.097
Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:53.855
I already know what you're gonna ask,
Miss Skeeter.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.231
Minny and Aibileen already did.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.996
I'm trying to get my boys
off to college.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:10.869
It's worthwhile what
y'all are doing, but...

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.629
...but my boys are worth more.

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:15.460
I understand.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:22.805
What do you understand, Skeeter?

01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:29.555
Yule Mae was just saying how excited she
is that her boys are going to college.

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:33.062
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter
if you could borrow money?

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.234
Of course not.

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:39.397
I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.779
Excuse me.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.163
Come on, baby.

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:59.585
Skeeter, are you intentionally not
putting my initiative in the newsletter?

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:03.550
No, not at all. I just have been
really busy with Mama.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.556
I know.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:09.345
I know, you must be so worried
about your mother, but...

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.267
I'm worried about you.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:14.899
Reading this stuff?

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:19.691
Believe it or not, there are real
racists in this town.

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:22.611
If the wrong person caught you
with anything like that,

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.775
you'd be in serious trouble.

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:28.325
I'll be on the lookout.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.535
Put my initiative in the newsletter.

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:39.422
OK?

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:31.142
Skeeter, get up!

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.644
- No! What?
- We've got to get dressed.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:36.514
What's wrong?

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:39.025
Don't panic. Don't panic.

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:44.064
There's a particularly tall and very
handsome man named Stuart here for you.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.990
Oh, God.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.151
Oh, mother.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.867
You would not like him. Trust me.

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:53.281
He's a drunken asshole.

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:57.668
Love and hate are two horns on the same
goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.955
Put that on. Hurry!

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:08.129
Look, I know it was a few weeks back,

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:12.220
but I came to say I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:14.351
Who sent you, William or Hilly?

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.636
Neither.

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:18.181
Hilly. But I wanted to come, OK.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:20.441
I was rude, and I've been
thinking about it a lot.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:24.021
- Well, I haven't. So you can just go.
- Goddamn it!

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:29.776
I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on
any date. Wasn't even close to ready.

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:36.790
I was engaged last year. She ended it.

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:38.292
I'm sure she did.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:40.874
It's not like that.
I'm not always a jerk.

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:46.717
We had been dating since we were 15,
and you know how it is.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:49.880
Actually, I don't. I've never really
dated anyone before.

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:51.505
Ever?

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:53.591
Ever.

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:57.971
All right, I, uh...

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:01.357
Well, that must be it, then.

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:02.858
- What?
- You, Skeeter.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:05.440
I've never met a woman that says
exactly what she's thinking.

01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:08.402
- Well, I got plenty to say.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:12.402
You make me laugh, smile.

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:17.915
Would you like to come
have dinner with me?

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:22.837
We could talk. I could actually
listen to you this time.

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:25.711
I can't think of anything worse.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.298
I understand, and I'm sorry.

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:32.009
That's what
I came here to say, and I said it.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:40.437
Just give me a minute.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:42.640
Let me get my sweater.

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:50.486
Not a big fan of oysters, huh?

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:53.367
Oysters are a vehicle
for crackers and ketchup.

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:57.447
Well, here's to new beginnings.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.628
Mm.

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:07.839
You're disgusting.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:09.591
You've already made that pretty clear.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.300
And just so you know,
the boys caught me reading

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.430
your Miss Myrna column
on the rig the other day.

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:18.092
Really? You read them?

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:19.260
All of them.

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:21.596
Very informative, too.

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:24.561
I had no idea that ground egg shells
got grease out of clothes.

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:26.145
Well, I do my homework.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.904
You're a good writer, Skeeter.

01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:36.402
Thank you.

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:40.740
I want to be a journalist.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:44.953
Or maybe a novelist. Or maybe both.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.083
I like that.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:51.759
You're really smart. And pretty.

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:01.977
Skeeter.

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:05.147
I hope you get to write something
really good.

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.691
Something you believe in.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:21.113
Hello?

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:26.460
What? I'm coming!

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:29.998
Aibileen! Come on. We have to go
help Hilly. Right now!

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:38.131
Oh! You're trespassing!

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.220
It's Skeeter!

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.725
She put it in the newsletter.

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.101
Oh, my God.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:47.891
I specifically said,
"Drop old coats at my house."

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.105
Not commodes!

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.110
Why would she do this to me?

01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:54.112
I don't know. I don't Know, Hilly.

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:56.945
It's so embarrassing.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.708
Oh, Lord.

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:08.244
I go potty, Mommy.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:11.293
No! Mae Mobley!

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:13.503
You get off of that toilet!

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.465
- You will catch diseases, you hear me?
- Mommy!

01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:19.630
You will catch diseases
on those toilets.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:37.490
You is kind, you is smart,

01:19:37.648 --> 01:19:39.867
you is important.

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:53.297
Don't shop for anything
on Capitol Street.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:58.336
Let's let the merchants down on
Capitol Street feel the economic pinch.

01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:00.425
Let me say this to you.

01:20:00.587 --> 01:20:03.306
I had one merchant to call me,
and he said,

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:08.096
"I want you to know that I've
talked to my national office today,

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:11.562
and they want me to tell you that we
don't need nigger business."

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:16.730
These are stores that help to support
the White Citizens' Council,

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:21.116
the council that is dedicated to keeping
you and I second-class citizens.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.118
Mama!

01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:27.493
Don't encourage them like that.

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:30.034
- That is national news.
- I won't have it!

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:34.250
You understand?

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.016
How you doing, Miss Clark?

01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:50.228
All right, Henry.

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:52.264
Thank you. How you doing?

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:57.354
If God is willing, Miss Clark.
If God is willing.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.941
That's good.

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:00.697
- Yeah.
- That's good.

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:10.783
What's going on out there, mister?

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:12.917
Colored people off.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:14.670
The rest of you,
let me know where you're going.

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:15.954
I'll get you close as I can.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.714
What happened?

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.671
I don't know. Some nigger got shot.

01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:22.635
- Where you headed?
- Woodrow Wilson.

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:24.763
Woodrow Wilson. All right.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:37.689
- You gonna be all right, Miss Clark?
- I'll be all right. You go on now.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:40.104
- You want me to walk you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:42.781
You have a good night.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.158
Which way you going?

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:56.128
We View this as a cold,

01:21:56.286 --> 01:21:58.254
brutal, deliberate...

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:03.670
...killing in a savage,
uncivilized state.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:09.013
There is no state with a record that
approaches that of Mississippi

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:13.350
in inhumanity murder, brutality

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:15.560
and racial hatred.

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:19.397
It is absolutely at the bottom
of the list.

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:22.020
Fifteen minutes past midnight,

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:25.942
Evers got out of his car beside his home
in a Negro residential area.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:28.031
In a vacant lot about 40 yards away

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:31.618
a sniper fired a single shot from a
high-powered rifle at Evers' silhouette.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.124
I'm all right. Sit down. You all right?

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:35.876
- I'm OK.
- The bullet hit him in the back,

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:38.913
crashed through his body
through a window, into the house.

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:41.548
He died within an hour
at a Jackson hospital.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:44.051
City detectives believe the fatal shot
was fired from...

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:48.214
KKK shot him. An hour ago.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.933
Right in front of his children,
Aibileen.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:56.559
We're gonna pray for the Evers.
We're gonna pray for Myrlie.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:23:00.067
We living in hell. Trapped.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:02.440
Our kids, trapped.

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:08.401
Sugar, take your brothers and sisters
and y'all go on to bed.

01:23:13.864 --> 01:23:15.707
Good night.

01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:18.210
Good night. Good night.

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:22.752
Oh. Good night, baby.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.471
What they gonna do if they catch us
with Miss Skeeter?

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:38.848
We're gonna be careful.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:44.862
Hitch us to a pickup? Drag us behind?
Shoot me in front of my children?

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.523
We ain't doing civil rights.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:50.613
We're just telling stories
like they really happened.

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.830
You're a fool, old woman.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.453
A fool.

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:32.993
Miss Phelan, the presses are heating up.
We needed Miss Myrna 30 minutes ago.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:34.611
Yes, Sir.

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:36.325
Chop-chop.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:38.991
Good Lord.

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.675
Miss Celia?

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:15.490
Miss Celia?

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:17.654
- Go home.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:20.074
You mess up your hair coloring again?

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.710
I helped you ix it last time.
We got it back to butter batch.

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:25.462
Was real pretty, remember?

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:30.842
Miss Celia.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.803
I told you, go home!

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.317
I said get out!

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:09.753
Why is there so much blood?

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:19.262
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:24.267
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:29.026
Then I lost it a month later.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.529
Johnny wants kids now.

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:38.819
What's he gonna do with me?

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.115
Well...

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.535
Mr. Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:51.127
He doesn't know about the baby.

01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:57.212
Or the two before.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.443
Yule Mae Davis?

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:58.652
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:03.203
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:10.207
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:14.168
I want to get my purse.
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.129
- Don't fight, Yule Mae!
- Aibee!

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:21.388
Aibee, I want my purse! I want my purse!

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.223
Just let me go!

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:30.264
Yule Mae, don't fight.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:41.943
I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:46.952
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and color.

01:28:48.281 --> 01:28:51.376
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:55.709
I am desperate for
a grilled cheese sandwich.

01:28:55.872 --> 01:28:58.295
Are you? Are you?
Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?

01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:00.131
Oh, yes.

01:29:00.293 --> 01:29:02.045
Just go sit down over there.

01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:13.098
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:14.891
Now.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.553
I'm gonna help with your stories.

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:51.269
I'm gonna help, too. Mm-hm.

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:54.310
We all are.

01:29:54.472 --> 01:29:57.442
- That's right.
- I'll help you.

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:01.279
I used to take
a shortcut every day

01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:04.157
when I went to work
at Dr. Dixon's house.

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:07.865
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:11.874
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

01:30:12.032 --> 01:30:15.627
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:22.051
Dr. Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:25.428
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:31.055
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:33.561
He did.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.769
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:41.145
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

01:30:42.228 --> 01:30:44.526
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:49.903
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:53.790
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:55.496
Mean for sport.

01:30:57.827 --> 01:31:00.501
Lord, I tried to find another job.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.709
But in everybody's mind

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:07.254
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:10.765
Owned me.

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:18.311
I leave early
this week for Thanksgiving.

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:21.272
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

01:31:21.434 --> 01:31:23.186
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

01:31:23.353 --> 01:31:26.357
- I'd better have it by then.
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:29.026
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.991
You do not want it in the pile.

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:33.245
Yes, ma'am.

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:36.750
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:39.461
I understand.

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:49.926
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

01:31:50.088 --> 01:31:53.092
I know, but I think We're on track.
We're doing quite well.

01:32:01.433 --> 01:32:02.935
- it's so good.
- Mm-hm.

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:04.944
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

01:32:05.729 --> 01:32:06.730
Aibileen?

01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:10.825
Hey, Elizabeth!

01:32:10.984 --> 01:32:13.328
It's me, Celia Foote.

01:32:15.447 --> 01:32:18.917
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:23.296
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.458
Get down! Get down! Get down!

01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:31.592
- Turn off the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

01:32:31.755 --> 01:32:33.598
Shh!

01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:39.679
Hey!

01:32:39.846 --> 01:32:40.893
Shh!

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:46.152
I brought a chocolate pie!

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.733
My maid, Minny, made it.

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:00.326
She's in the bushes.

01:33:22.138 --> 01:33:26.894
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:38.618
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:41.870
Why, Minny?

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:47.873
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr. Johnny.

01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:49.962
Mad you married one of their mens.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:54.717
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr. Johnny had just broke up, too.

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:57.428
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:59.263
when they were still going steady.

01:33:59.425 --> 01:34:01.519
Mm-hm.

01:34:01.678 --> 01:34:05.933
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr. Johnny, too.

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:09.311
No wonder!

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:16.489
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.034
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:23.120
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:27.541
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:30.961
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.720
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:41.013
That looks bad.

01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:44.729
Let me take a look.

01:34:45.597 --> 01:34:47.270
I got to get these peas on.

01:34:47.432 --> 01:34:50.185
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:14.005
You know what I'd do if I were you?

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:17.846
I'd give it right back to him.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:22.259
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

01:35:22.425 --> 01:35:25.178
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell."

01:35:35.605 --> 01:35:37.949
From here, the members of the family...

01:35:41.319 --> 01:35:44.664
...visitors from foreign countries
and others

01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:47.826
will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.

01:35:54.374 --> 01:35:57.173
Senator Edward Kennedy
getting out of the car.

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:00.555
Mrs. Kennedy.

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:03.967
Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.

01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:06.227
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:09.139
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:23.865
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:27.866
What if people ind out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

01:36:28.032 --> 01:36:29.375
figure out who who?

01:36:32.578 --> 01:36:34.501
Maybe we need us some insurance.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.470
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:43.469
But we ain't got no choice.

01:36:44.966 --> 01:36:45.967
Sorry.

01:36:47.093 --> 01:36:50.973
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:54.601
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:01.069
Mmm.

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:03.200
Mm-mm-mm.

01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:07.823
So...

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:12.501
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

01:37:15.371 --> 01:37:16.543
Did they?

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.515
Oh. Pie's as good as always, Minny.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:27.926
I'm glad you like it.

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:29.469
Mmm.

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:33.143
Oh.

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:38.233
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

01:37:38.394 --> 01:37:39.862
Take me back?

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:46.112
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:49.030
That good vanilla from Mexico...

01:37:49.197 --> 01:37:51.825
...and something else real special.

01:37:53.368 --> 01:37:54.620
Mmm.

01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:58.962
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:03.381
Mama can have a piece.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:07.428
Cut her one.

01:38:09.217 --> 01:38:10.560
Go get a plate.

01:38:15.515 --> 01:38:16.732
Eat my shit.

01:38:20.978 --> 01:38:22.355
What'd you say?

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:26.569
I said, "Eat... my... shit."

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:37.503
Have you lost your mind?

01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:44.465
No, ma'am, but you about to,
'cause you just did.

01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:47.797
Did what?

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:10.908
And you didn't eat just one.

01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:13.243
You had two slices!

01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:26.085
Run, Minny, run!

01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:32.266
You trying to get yourself killed?

01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:35.349
No! I wasn't planning on telling.

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:39.148
I just wanted to see her take a bite.

01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:44.313
Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

01:39:45.521 --> 01:39:48.240
Before I knew it, I had done
told that woman what was in that pie!

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:53.112
I done ask God to forgive me.

01:39:55.114 --> 01:39:57.993
But more for what happened
to poor Miss Walters.

01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:04.792
Miss Hilly threw her in that
nursing home... just for laughing.

01:40:06.375 --> 01:40:08.093
We can't put that story in the book.

01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:10.338
We ain't got no choice.

01:40:11.047 --> 01:40:14.551
Hilly Holbrook can't let nobody know
that pie story about her.

01:40:14.717 --> 01:40:16.845
Exactly. If people find out
the terrible awful

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:19.264
was you and Miss Hilly
we in trouble there ain't words for.

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:21.524
Right! But don't you see?

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:24.982
She gonna go to her grave convincing
folks this book ain't about Jackson.

01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:27.897
Now, that keeps us safe. Insured.

01:40:29.232 --> 01:40:30.609
No.

01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:32.994
No, that's too dangerous.

01:40:37.406 --> 01:40:40.785
Y'all two brought me into this,
but I'm gonna finish it.

01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:45.006
Either put it in, or pull my parts
out altogether. Y'all pick!

01:40:56.425 --> 01:40:59.395
Thank you, Tommy. I should be out
by 10:00. See you then.

01:41:05.017 --> 01:41:08.692
This is Jolene French, reporting from
the African Children's Benefit Ball,

01:41:08.854 --> 01:41:12.199
and I'm here with League President,
Miss Hilly Holbrook.

01:41:12.358 --> 01:41:16.864
Thanks, Jolene. And I'm just so excited
for the auction tonight, aren't you?

01:41:17.029 --> 01:41:18.997
I'm absolutely thrilled.

01:41:19.865 --> 01:41:21.458
Scandalous!

01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:25.079
Thank you.

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.678
Hi!

01:41:43.681 --> 01:41:45.354
Did you see what Miss Celia got on?

01:41:45.516 --> 01:41:48.690
Lord, have mercy. Women better hold onto
their husbands tonight.

01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:52.365
Miss Leefolt been working on that dress
for four weeks

01:41:52.523 --> 01:41:53.649
and that's what she came up with?

01:41:53.816 --> 01:41:56.490
Here.

01:42:08.414 --> 01:42:09.586
Kiss me.

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:45.542
Everybody enjoying the evening?

01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:53.377
Let's give a nice round of applause
for the help.

01:42:57.129 --> 01:43:00.349
For all the men and women who have
helped make tonight possible.

01:43:02.134 --> 01:43:04.978
A cause I'm sure is dear
to their hearts as well.

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:09.559
- Your cocktail.
- Thank you.

01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:15.361
Honey, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:17.241
I wish you'd try and eat something.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.619
I'm not having my stomach poke out.

01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:27.411
OK, OK, everybody, quiet down.
I got the list of the winners!

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:30.789
OK.

01:43:30.955 --> 01:43:35.711
The winner of the beautiful
mink car coat is...

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:37.594
...Charlotte Phelan!

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:41.215
Congrats, Miss Phelan.

01:43:41.382 --> 01:43:43.555
Ladies, I hope
your husbands take note of that.

01:43:45.094 --> 01:43:48.519
Now it's time for the baked goods.

01:43:49.724 --> 01:43:51.647
Ooh, yummy, yummy!

01:43:51.809 --> 01:43:55.029
The highest bid
in baked goods goes to

01:43:55.187 --> 01:43:58.031
Minny Jackson's chocolate pie.

01:43:59.817 --> 01:44:01.319
Congratulations...

01:44:01.986 --> 01:44:03.704
...Hilly Holbrook!

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:08.247
- Oh! Hilly.
- That's funny.

01:44:08.409 --> 01:44:10.082
I didn't bid on anything.

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:13.794
All right. And now it's time
for Danica's strawberry jam.

01:44:13.956 --> 01:44:15.208
Shh!

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:19.795
Congratulations, Hilly!

01:44:19.962 --> 01:44:23.091
I didn't know you were a fan
of Minny's pies.

01:44:24.675 --> 01:44:27.144
I've been wanting to talk to you
all night.

01:44:27.303 --> 01:44:29.271
Minny said why you won't be my friend.

01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:31.683
It's 'cause you think me and Johnny
went behind your back.

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:35.273
Wait. I want to talk...

01:44:35.436 --> 01:44:36.813
Oh, no.

01:44:36.979 --> 01:44:38.652
I'm so sorry.

01:44:41.859 --> 01:44:43.611
Come here, sweetheart.

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:45.530
Let me bring you back to your table.

01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:50.459
- I'm really sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

01:44:51.744 --> 01:44:55.339
What are you trying to do to me?
What are you and that nigra up to?

01:44:55.498 --> 01:44:57.171
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:44:57.333 --> 01:44:58.880
You liar! Who did you tell?

01:44:59.043 --> 01:45:01.341
Hilly, I got pregnant
after you and Johnny broke up!

01:45:01.504 --> 01:45:04.178
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, Mother!

01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:07.765
Johnny never cheated on you.

01:45:08.677 --> 01:45:10.179
At least not with me.

01:45:10.346 --> 01:45:13.725
Oh, Johnny would never cheat on me.

01:45:13.891 --> 01:45:17.270
I'm so sorry! I thought you'd be tickled
you won that pie!

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:22.525
You tell that nigra, if she tells
anybody, I will make her suffer!

01:45:22.691 --> 01:45:24.989
Hey, that is enough.

01:45:25.569 --> 01:45:26.570
Celia.

01:45:26.737 --> 01:45:28.239
Hey, baby, what's the matter?

01:45:28.405 --> 01:45:30.999
- Oh!
- Cel?

01:45:32.034 --> 01:45:33.035
Oh!

01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:37.962
Oh, shit. What a mess. Napkins.

01:45:39.458 --> 01:45:42.132
Why don't we get back to the auction?

01:45:42.294 --> 01:45:45.218
- Next up, Debby's peppermint bark.
- Celia!

01:45:45.798 --> 01:45:47.846
It goes great with hot cocoa.

01:45:53.722 --> 01:45:55.941
Oh, just come on home with us
tonight, Mother.

01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:59.354
No, thanks. I've got a pie to eat.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.943
You throw that pie away right now.

01:46:02.106 --> 01:46:04.234
I spent good money on this pie.

01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:06.948
I won it just for you.

01:46:07.111 --> 01:46:09.239
You signed me up?

01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:13.455
I may have trouble remembering my own
name, or what country I live in,

01:46:13.617 --> 01:46:16.040
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:19.753
that my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:21.917
and that she ate Minny's shit.

01:46:23.002 --> 01:46:24.174
Good night.

01:46:28.382 --> 01:46:31.852
- Hey, how about a nightcap?
- Let's go.

01:46:38.976 --> 01:46:42.150
I'm not right for this
kind of life, Minny.

01:46:44.023 --> 01:46:47.197
I don't need a dining room table
for 12 people.

01:46:48.027 --> 01:46:51.406
I couldn't get two people
over here if I begged.

01:46:55.701 --> 01:46:58.045
I can't do this to Johnny any more.

01:47:00.456 --> 01:47:02.754
That's why I've gotta go back
to Sugar Ditch.

01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:06.679
You can't move back to Sugar Ditch.

01:47:08.923 --> 01:47:10.971
Lord.

01:47:11.634 --> 01:47:13.932
I reckon it's time you knew.

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:15.266
Sit down.

01:47:25.981 --> 01:47:29.030
So Miss Hilly thought you knew about
the terrible awful.

01:47:30.319 --> 01:47:32.321
That you was making fun of her.

01:47:35.324 --> 01:47:37.873
It's my fault she pounced on you.

01:47:40.371 --> 01:47:42.373
If you leave Mr. Johnny...

01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:47.803
...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

01:47:49.964 --> 01:47:51.807
Then she done beaten me...

01:47:53.217 --> 01:47:55.311
...and she done beat you.

01:48:02.351 --> 01:48:04.900
Thank you for telling me that.

01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:16.033
Lord, look at all these pages. 266.

01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:18.367
Mm-mm!

01:48:19.618 --> 01:48:22.497
So we just send it off?
Just wait and see?

01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:24.381
Hope Miss Stein gonna publish it?

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:28.670
Well, I have one more story to type
before I put it in the mail,

01:48:28.836 --> 01:48:30.338
but other than that, we're done.

01:48:30.504 --> 01:48:32.097
Which one you got left?

01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:35.763
Uh, mine.

01:48:46.395 --> 01:48:48.864
I need to talk to you about Constantine.

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:53.361
Oh, Eugenia, that was so long ago.

01:48:53.902 --> 01:48:55.074
What happened?

01:48:55.237 --> 01:48:57.615
Oh.

01:48:58.407 --> 01:49:00.250
What happened?

01:49:04.997 --> 01:49:07.125
She didn't give me a choice.

01:49:12.254 --> 01:49:17.181
The Daughters of America had just
appointed me state regent.

01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:23.315
Grace Higginbotham, our esteemed
president, came all the way down

01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:27.445
from Washington, D.C.,
to our house for the ceremony.

01:49:29.063 --> 01:49:33.068
That's just beautiful. Look at that.

01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:40.291
She'd gotten so old and slow, Skeeter.

01:49:43.994 --> 01:49:45.211
Yes, ma'am.

01:49:47.873 --> 01:49:51.298
It's such an honor
that you came all this way.

01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:01.057
That's all right.

01:50:05.891 --> 01:50:08.565
- Hello, Miss Charlotte.
- Rachel.

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:12.732
We were expecting you next week.

01:50:12.898 --> 01:50:14.696
I decided to come early
and surprise Mama.

01:50:14.858 --> 01:50:16.781
Oh.

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:19.197
I'm entertaining.

01:50:19.363 --> 01:50:21.741
Why don't you go around back.
Wait in the kitchen.

01:50:27.412 --> 01:50:28.709
Go on now.

01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:33.377
I am sorry.

01:50:36.338 --> 01:50:38.966
Rachel, what are you doing?

01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:42.387
I'm just doing as I was told,
Miss Charlotte.

01:50:42.553 --> 01:50:44.055
Going to the kitchen.

01:50:44.221 --> 01:50:46.315
But I'm going to see my mama first.

01:50:47.766 --> 01:50:50.519
Hello, Mama.

01:50:50.686 --> 01:50:53.405
Go on to the kitchen, baby.
I'll be there directly.

01:50:53.564 --> 01:50:57.740
You may put up with this kind
of nonsense, but I do not.

01:51:04.449 --> 01:51:05.996
Get out of this house, Rachel.

01:51:10.122 --> 01:51:12.500
You heard her. Go on, girl.

01:51:12.666 --> 01:51:16.796
Miss Charlotte, let me take her to
the kitchen. Come on, baby. Let's go.

01:51:18.672 --> 01:51:20.094
Charlotte.

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:26.434
Both of you.

01:51:26.597 --> 01:51:29.225
Leave. Now.

01:51:33.395 --> 01:51:34.738
Come on, Mama.

01:52:07.262 --> 01:52:08.809
Come on now.

01:52:22.444 --> 01:52:24.947
Constantine didn't do anything wrong.

01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:28.580
And you love Rachel. I know you do.

01:52:28.742 --> 01:52:31.916
She was our president.
What was I supposed to do?

01:52:32.913 --> 01:52:37.259
She did you the biggest favor of
your life. She taught me everything.

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:40.591
Well, you idolized her too much.
You always have.

01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:42.882
I needed someone to look up to.

01:52:46.301 --> 01:52:47.678
Well, I...

01:52:48.512 --> 01:52:52.187
I went to her house the next day,
but she had already gone.

01:53:22.921 --> 01:53:24.468
How could you not tell me all this?

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:28.135
Because I didn't want to upset you
during your final exams.

01:53:28.302 --> 01:53:31.021
I knew you'd blame me,
and it wasn't my fault!

01:53:31.179 --> 01:53:32.772
I have to go find her. She needs me.

01:53:32.931 --> 01:53:34.228
- Eugenia.
- What?

01:53:36.143 --> 01:53:39.613
We sent your brother up to Chicago
to bring Constantine home.

01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:49.952
When he got there...

01:53:54.036 --> 01:53:55.583
...she had died.

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.814
You broke her heart.

01:54:19.394 --> 01:54:24.321
- I'm...
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

01:54:27.402 --> 01:54:29.029
I'm sorry.

01:55:24.835 --> 01:55:26.803
They printed a few thousand copies

01:55:26.962 --> 01:55:30.307
with the worst advance Miss Stein
had ever seen.

01:55:30.465 --> 01:55:33.093
Baby, what you doing with Alicia book?
You can't read.

01:55:34.177 --> 01:55:39.525
They sent Miss Skeeter $600. She broke
that money up and gave it to each of us.

01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:45.277
Divided 13 ways,
that came to about $46 each.

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:52.704
Y'all finish your homework.

01:55:57.868 --> 01:56:00.462
Aibileen. Aibileen!

01:56:01.288 --> 01:56:03.962
We just got this from Miss Skeeter.
Look at it.

01:56:04.124 --> 01:56:05.671
Look at it.

01:56:05.834 --> 01:56:07.552
Look at it!

01:56:07.711 --> 01:56:09.679
Minny, we're rich!

01:56:11.590 --> 01:56:15.060
"She fired me
for using her inside toilet.

01:56:15.218 --> 01:56:19.974
Put me out in a storm and told me never
to come back. But I did come back.

01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:24.316
I came back with a pie I had baked
to say I'm sorry.

01:56:25.353 --> 01:56:26.696
I watched her eat..."

01:56:37.073 --> 01:56:39.246
Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly.

01:56:39.409 --> 01:56:43.334
Filled with gripping testimonials
from Mississippi's housekeepers.

01:56:44.164 --> 01:56:46.007
OK, Mama. I need to run.

01:56:46.166 --> 01:56:50.967
Well. You should read the book, Hilly.
It's quite scandalous.

01:56:51.129 --> 01:56:54.724
Sounds like... Jackson, if you ask me.

01:56:55.217 --> 01:56:56.560
Quite scandalous.

01:56:57.886 --> 01:56:59.138
What book?

01:56:59.304 --> 01:57:00.521
What's it called again?

01:57:00.764 --> 01:57:01.765
Uh...

01:57:02.098 --> 01:57:04.817
The Help. H-E-L-P.

01:57:32.587 --> 01:57:33.930
There it is.

01:57:42.264 --> 01:57:43.732
You told me to write something good.

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:46.063
- Something I believed in.
- It's not what I believe in.

01:57:46.226 --> 01:57:49.070
That joke you pulled with Hilly
with the toilets, that's funny.

01:57:50.605 --> 01:57:52.573
Why would you do this to us?

01:57:53.567 --> 01:57:55.160
I don't even know why you care.

01:57:55.318 --> 01:57:58.162
- What?
- Things are fine around here.

01:57:58.321 --> 01:57:59.743
Why go stir up trouble?

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:02.284
Trouble's already here, Stuart.

01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:04.418
I had to tell you this.
You needed to know.

01:58:04.578 --> 01:58:07.457
Goddamn right I needed to know. You
should have told me this from the start.

01:58:12.252 --> 01:58:13.879
You're a selfish woman, Skeeter.

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:16.802
Stuart.

01:58:16.965 --> 01:58:19.093
I think you're better off being alone.

01:59:07.265 --> 01:59:08.812
Yeah.

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:11.728
Did you get to that part yet
that I was telling you about?

01:59:11.895 --> 01:59:13.772
Don't read ahead, whatever you do.

01:59:13.938 --> 01:59:16.236
"What you done put up in this?"

01:59:16.399 --> 01:59:19.778
"She Said, 'My Shit."'

01:59:34.668 --> 01:59:36.215
What's the matter, Hilly?

01:59:37.712 --> 01:59:41.467
- Get off of me! Get off!
- Ouch! Stop hitting me!

01:59:43.593 --> 01:59:46.221
I heard that Betty character
might be Mary Elizabeth.

01:59:46.388 --> 01:59:48.766
It's not Jackson.

01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:53.312
And that book is garbage. I bet the
whole thing is made up by some nigra.

01:59:53.478 --> 01:59:55.401
And Jolene, didn't your mama

01:59:55.563 --> 01:59:57.565
leave Cora to you in her will?

01:59:57.732 --> 02:00:01.657
Yes, but that's not odd, is it?
Happens all the time, right?

02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:04.539
The book is not about Jackson.

02:01:29.449 --> 02:01:30.951
What the hell?

02:01:32.285 --> 02:01:33.787
What are you doing here?

02:01:35.663 --> 02:01:37.916
I've contacted my lawyer.

02:01:38.082 --> 02:01:40.710
Hibbie Goodman? He's the best
libel attorney in the state.

02:01:40.877 --> 02:01:42.504
Oh, Missy, you're going to jail.

02:01:42.670 --> 02:01:44.422
You can't prove anything.

02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:47.934
Oh, I 100 percent know you wrote it.
Nobody else in town is as tacky as you.

02:01:48.092 --> 02:01:49.969
You don't know anything, Hilly.

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:51.638
Oh, I don't, do I?

02:01:52.305 --> 02:01:55.354
You tell Aibileen the next time
she wants to write

02:01:55.517 --> 02:01:58.396
about my dear friend Elizabeth...

02:01:58.561 --> 02:02:02.486
Uh-huh.
Remember her? Had you in her wedding.

02:02:02.649 --> 02:02:05.869
Let's just say Aibileen ought to have
been a little bit smarter

02:02:06.027 --> 02:02:08.701
before putting in about that
L-shaped scratch

02:02:08.863 --> 02:02:11.537
in poor Elizabeth's dining table.

02:02:13.618 --> 02:02:17.418
And that nigger Minny,
do I have plans for her.

02:02:18.081 --> 02:02:22.882
Careful, Hilly. That's chapter 12.

02:02:23.044 --> 02:02:25.217
Don't give yourself away now.

02:02:25.672 --> 02:02:27.299
That was not me!

02:02:28.216 --> 02:02:30.389
I've come to tell your mother
what a hippie you've become.

02:02:30.552 --> 02:02:32.600
She's going to be disgusted by you.

02:02:32.762 --> 02:02:36.392
Why, Hilly. Is everything OK, you two?

02:02:36.558 --> 02:02:37.559
Oh, Mrs. Phelan.

02:02:37.725 --> 02:02:41.605
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess.
Are you ill?

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:43.481
No, ma'am.

02:02:43.648 --> 02:02:48.620
Darling, oh, no husband wants
to come home and see that.

02:02:48.945 --> 02:02:50.572
Oh.

02:02:50.738 --> 02:02:52.206
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

02:02:52.365 --> 02:02:54.333
You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

02:02:54.492 --> 02:02:58.167
I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

02:03:02.625 --> 02:03:05.925
Mrs. Phelan, I came here...

02:03:06.087 --> 02:03:08.590
In fact, I'm sure of it.

02:03:08.756 --> 02:03:10.975
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

02:03:11.634 --> 02:03:13.511
Go on.

02:03:13.678 --> 02:03:16.773
Get off my property. Now!

02:03:17.849 --> 02:03:21.103
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

02:03:36.451 --> 02:03:39.705
Eugenia. Take me inside, please.

02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:41.831
Yes, ma'am.

02:03:57.472 --> 02:04:00.476
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

02:04:01.184 --> 02:04:02.811
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:07.023
Because we are going shopping.

02:04:08.942 --> 02:04:11.411
No single daughter of mine is
going to New York City

02:04:11.569 --> 02:04:13.162
representing the great state
of Mississippi

02:04:13.321 --> 02:04:15.744
without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.

02:04:15.907 --> 02:04:17.284
How do you know about New York?

02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:20.249
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

02:04:27.961 --> 02:04:30.885
Courage sometimes skips a generation.

02:04:33.841 --> 02:04:36.640
Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

02:04:45.937 --> 02:04:48.065
I can't leave you like this.

02:04:48.564 --> 02:04:51.693
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

02:04:51.859 --> 02:04:54.328
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

02:04:54.487 --> 02:04:57.661
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

02:04:57.824 --> 02:05:02.250
but I have decided not to die.

02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:08.922
Oh, Mama.

02:05:09.085 --> 02:05:10.803
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

02:05:10.962 --> 02:05:13.215
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:15.804
but they wouldn't allow it.

02:05:18.094 --> 02:05:22.565
I have never been more proud of you.

02:05:27.478 --> 02:05:29.196
Thank you.

02:05:37.822 --> 02:05:39.199
Mama.

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:08.895
Need some help with those?

02:06:11.064 --> 02:06:12.281
Minny.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.317
- Miss Celia!
- Minny, hey, stop! Minny!

02:06:14.484 --> 02:06:16.111
- Miss Celia!
- Minny!

02:06:16.277 --> 02:06:20.157
- Stay back!
- I'm not here to hurt you! Girl...

02:06:22.075 --> 02:06:23.748
You gonna put the stick down?

02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:25.628
Uh-uh.

02:06:28.289 --> 02:06:31.839
Listen, Celia finally told me
about the babies.

02:06:33.044 --> 02:06:34.387
All of them.

02:06:36.172 --> 02:06:39.847
But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

02:06:40.009 --> 02:06:41.852
she started getting better.

02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:44.813
So, you saved her life.

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:50.986
You knew I was here the whole time?

02:06:51.145 --> 02:06:54.445
Fried chicken and okra
on the first night?

02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:58.153
Y'all could have at least put
some cornpone on the table.

02:07:00.863 --> 02:07:02.035
No.

02:07:03.699 --> 02:07:06.043
I couldn't let you eat no more cornpone,
Mr. Johnny.

02:07:06.202 --> 02:07:09.046
Thanks to you, now I've had to let out
every pair of pants I own.

02:07:17.046 --> 02:07:19.390
You just leave that.

02:07:20.049 --> 02:07:21.392
Here you go.

02:07:22.385 --> 02:07:24.058
Let's head on up the house.

02:07:48.744 --> 02:07:49.836
What's this?

02:07:50.705 --> 02:07:52.378
I cooked it all by myself.

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:55.134
- Yes, she did.
- She was up all night.

02:07:56.752 --> 02:07:58.846
I wanted to do something special.

02:08:00.089 --> 02:08:02.217
I wanted to say thank you.

02:08:05.386 --> 02:08:06.387
So...

02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:09.023
...I ain't losing my job?

02:08:11.017 --> 02:08:14.692
No, you got a job here
for the rest of your life.

02:08:14.854 --> 02:08:16.071
If you want it.

02:08:22.445 --> 02:08:24.539
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss Celia.

02:08:33.998 --> 02:08:36.251
- Please.
- Thank you.

02:08:40.254 --> 02:08:42.177
Ooh.

02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:43.808
You remember to check the thighs?

02:08:43.966 --> 02:08:47.561
- Mm-hm. Cooked clean through.
- Ain't pink in the middle?

02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:50.894
Uh-uh. Just the way you taught me.

02:08:51.057 --> 02:08:52.934
Looky here.

02:08:56.771 --> 02:08:59.775
That table of food
gave Minny the strength she needed.

02:09:00.858 --> 02:09:05.455
She took her babies out from under Leroy
and never went back.

02:09:09.992 --> 02:09:12.620
What are all these cars
doing out here? Are we late?

02:09:12.787 --> 02:09:14.130
No, we ain't late.

02:09:15.748 --> 02:09:16.795
Why ain't you singing?

02:09:16.958 --> 02:09:19.086
We got to worry about getting
in there and getting our seats.

02:09:19.252 --> 02:09:20.469
Come on now, we late!

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:32.728
- Who we clapping for?
- Honey, we clapping for you!

02:09:36.269 --> 02:09:37.987
Come on down, Sister Clark!

02:09:38.896 --> 02:09:40.068
Come on.

02:09:58.249 --> 02:09:59.671
Come on.

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:03.804
All right, all right.

02:10:05.423 --> 02:10:10.600
Now, uh... this is an important time
in our community.

02:10:11.387 --> 02:10:15.642
And we have to thank you
for what you have done.

02:10:18.019 --> 02:10:19.145
Now...

02:10:20.271 --> 02:10:22.899
We know you couldn't put
your name in here,

02:10:24.317 --> 02:10:26.035
so we all signed our own.

02:10:28.446 --> 02:10:29.538
Thank you.

02:10:31.866 --> 02:10:35.666
Come on, now. Come on.

02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:17.120
Churches over two counties
signed our books. All for you and me.

02:11:21.123 --> 02:11:22.466
It's beautiful.

02:11:25.795 --> 02:11:26.921
What's wrong?

02:11:33.135 --> 02:11:35.604
I got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York.

02:11:36.222 --> 02:11:38.020
Congratulations!

02:11:38.182 --> 02:11:41.777
- I'm not taking it.
- What you mean you're not taking it?

02:11:41.936 --> 02:11:43.563
I can't just leave you two here

02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:46.152
when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

02:11:46.315 --> 02:11:51.071
No. If bad things happen,
ain't nothing you can do about it.

02:11:51.237 --> 02:11:53.615
And now it's for a reason
we can be proud of.

02:11:55.866 --> 02:11:57.868
I don't mean to rub salt in your wound,

02:11:58.035 --> 02:12:00.504
but you ain't got a good life here
in Jackson.

02:12:00.663 --> 02:12:02.131
Plus, your mama's getting better.

02:12:02.289 --> 02:12:05.668
You ain't got nothing left here
but enemies in the Junior League.

02:12:05.835 --> 02:12:07.758
You done burned every bridge there is.

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:10.389
And you ain't never gonna
get another man in this town.

02:12:10.548 --> 02:12:12.767
Everybody know that.

02:12:12.925 --> 02:12:16.350
So don't walk your white butt
to New York, run it!

02:12:18.347 --> 02:12:22.022
Looky here, Miss Skeeter.
I'm gonna take care of Aibileen.

02:12:24.186 --> 02:12:25.984
And she's gonna take care of me.

02:12:37.741 --> 02:12:40.210
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

02:12:53.799 --> 02:12:56.177
Aibileen, can you come in here, please?

02:13:02.308 --> 02:13:03.355
Good morning.

02:13:04.101 --> 02:13:08.982
Aibileen, the silver
I lent Elizabeth last week.

02:13:09.148 --> 02:13:11.242
It not polished good?

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.654
Humidity been fighting me
on polishing day.

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:19.496
When you returned it, three pieces
were missing from the felt wrapper.

02:13:20.826 --> 02:13:24.080
A fork and two spoons.

02:13:24.246 --> 02:13:27.796
Let me... Let me go check in the
kitchen. Maybe I left some behind.

02:13:27.958 --> 02:13:31.007
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

02:13:33.339 --> 02:13:35.592
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

02:13:36.717 --> 02:13:38.811
Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

02:13:38.969 --> 02:13:40.721
Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

02:13:41.764 --> 02:13:43.562
She's trying to blame it on a toddler.

02:13:45.726 --> 02:13:47.399
I ain't got no silver.

02:13:47.561 --> 02:13:49.655
She says she doesn't have them.

02:13:50.147 --> 02:13:54.402
Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are Tired, Aibileen.

02:13:55.528 --> 02:13:57.701
And I'll be calling the police.

02:13:59.615 --> 02:14:02.414
Aibee, my throat hurts.

02:14:04.578 --> 02:14:07.297
I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

02:14:07.998 --> 02:14:10.501
Elizabeth can take care
of her own children.

02:14:13.921 --> 02:14:16.765
- I'll go get the cough syrup.
- Come here, Lil Man.

02:14:16.924 --> 02:14:18.346
I'm OK.

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:30.775
I didn't steal no silver.

02:14:30.938 --> 02:14:34.659
Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

02:14:34.817 --> 02:14:36.694
but I can send you for being a thief.

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:39.283
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

02:14:39.989 --> 02:14:43.118
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

02:14:43.284 --> 02:14:46.959
Plenty of time to write the truth
about you. And the paper is free.

02:14:47.121 --> 02:14:49.795
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

02:14:50.332 --> 02:14:53.632
I been told I'm a pretty good writer.
Already sold a lot of books.

02:14:58.382 --> 02:15:00.555
Call the police, Elizabeth.

02:15:01.302 --> 02:15:04.021
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

02:15:04.179 --> 02:15:05.180
Aibileen, stop!

02:15:05.347 --> 02:15:07.395
You a godless woman.

02:15:09.435 --> 02:15:11.529
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

02:15:14.189 --> 02:15:15.532
Ain't you tired?

02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:31.377
Aibileen, you have to go now.

02:15:46.013 --> 02:15:48.436
Don't go, Aibee.

02:15:49.642 --> 02:15:51.986
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

02:15:52.519 --> 02:15:56.569
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

02:15:56.732 --> 02:15:59.485
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

02:15:59.652 --> 02:16:01.620
No, that's not the reason.

02:16:01.779 --> 02:16:05.329
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

02:16:05.491 --> 02:16:07.744
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:09.912
Baby. Baby.

02:16:10.913 --> 02:16:13.416
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

02:16:13.582 --> 02:16:15.710
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

02:16:15.876 --> 02:16:21.303
You is kind. You is smart.

02:16:21.465 --> 02:16:23.138
You is important.

02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:25.177
That's right, Baby Girl.

02:16:30.391 --> 02:16:31.859
Don't go, Aibee.

02:16:32.017 --> 02:16:33.234
I gots to, baby.

02:16:35.896 --> 02:16:37.818
You give my sweet girl a chance.

02:16:54.123 --> 02:16:56.376
Mae Mobley was my last baby.

02:16:58.835 --> 02:17:01.715
In just ten minutes,
the only life I knew was done.

02:17:01.879 --> 02:17:04.599
Aibee!

02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:10.064
God says we need to love our enemies.

02:17:10.222 --> 02:17:11.565
No!

02:17:13.475 --> 02:17:14.817
It hard to do.

02:17:21.066 --> 02:17:23.193
But it can start by telling the truth.

02:17:28.365 --> 02:17:31.959
No one had ever asked me
what it felt like to be me.

02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:37.378
Once I told the truth about that...

02:17:39.376 --> 02:17:41.049
...I felt free.

02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:52.565
And I got to thinking
about all the people I know.

02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:56.602
And the things I seen and done.

02:18:02.357 --> 02:18:06.702
My boy, Treelore, always said we going
to have a writer in the family one day.

02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:12.160
I guess it's gonna be me.
