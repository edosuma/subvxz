WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:04.626
Listen up, Alamo people,
everybody into the waiting room.

00:04.798 --> 00:06.755
If you are not sick,
then please go home.

00:06.925 --> 00:08.716
The night shift hasn't
even started yet...

00:08.885 --> 00:10.593
and you're giving everybody
a headache.

00:10.762 --> 00:12.402
<i>Night shift, report to duty
in one minute.</i>

00:12.431 --> 00:14.886
- How long does this go on?
- All night.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.932
They just keep trickling in.

00:17.102 --> 00:21.100
Every year these Alamo re-enactors
drink too much homemade beer...

00:21.273 --> 00:23.515
and eat too much rabbit stew.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.641
Mop up on aisle three.

00:26.820 --> 00:30.319
No, no, no. Look, if you can't
get here, then you can't get here.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.363
No, it's fine, It's just...

00:33.827 --> 00:37.492
I was hoping that since
it's my birthday tomorrow, but...

00:38.206 --> 00:43.034
No, I understand, really. Yeah.
We'll celebrate next week.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.670
Scott, I gotta go.

00:48.633 --> 00:52.714
Male, 30s. Single GSW
to proximal thigh. BP stable.

00:52.888 --> 00:56.054
- We found him at the Alamo.
- Where am I?

00:56.224 --> 00:59.309
You've been shot, okay?
But we're gonna take care of you.

00:59.478 --> 01:02.811
- Can you tell me your name?
- I don't know! I don't know!

01:02.981 --> 01:04.772
No ID. Guy's on another planet.

01:04.941 --> 01:06.336
We could barely get him
in the ambulance.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.400
There's another problem.
He's a Christian Scientist.

01:08.570 --> 01:11.357
He says not to treat him.
We didn't see it until we were en route.

01:11.531 --> 01:14.449
We can't treat him, right?
We need consent or we'll get sued.

01:14.618 --> 01:16.907
Don't worry about it.

01:19.748 --> 01:21.741
He looks like he was shot
with a cannon.

01:21.917 --> 01:23.292
Musket. I bought it online.

01:23.460 --> 01:25.369
- Hey, hey! Put that thing down!
- Okay.

01:25.545 --> 01:28.630
I didn't know it was loaded, I swear.
The dude lost it on me.

01:28.799 --> 01:31.800
He attacked me like we were
in a real fight and it went off.

01:31.968 --> 01:33.546
You cannot be back here.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.547
Okay, but can someone check
on my arm?

01:37.516 --> 01:39.508
- Where are you taking me?
- What do we got?

01:39.685 --> 01:41.843
It's a musket wound,
1830s Alamo special.

01:42.020 --> 01:44.392
- Stop it! Stop it!
- And worse, agitated patient.

01:44.606 --> 01:45.851
- Three.
- Don't touch me!

01:46.024 --> 01:49.274
- No! No, no, no!
- Calm down! We're trying to help you!

01:49.444 --> 01:51.188
- Calm down!
- Stop it!

01:51.363 --> 01:52.643
We're trying to help!

01:52.823 --> 01:54.981
Get me two of Ativan and
somebody page Dr. De la Cruz.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.696
- We're trying to help you!
- Get off me!

01:58.453 --> 02:00.446
- Jordan, ready with the Ativan.
- Got it.

02:00.622 --> 02:01.820
You're trying to kill me!

02:02.499 --> 02:05.666
Somebody grab the hard restraints,
huh?

02:07.921 --> 02:10.293
Hell of a night for Drew to be off
on manoeuvres.

02:10.465 --> 02:12.422
- We could use the muscle.
- Yeah.

02:12.592 --> 02:15.759
<i>- Be good to have him back tomorrow.</i>
- I gotta be honest.

02:15.929 --> 02:18.764
I got no love
for night infiltration exercise.

02:18.932 --> 02:20.592
This is a cakewalk, Javy.

02:20.767 --> 02:24.101
Army Reserves is nothing compared
to the 61 days of hell...

02:24.271 --> 02:26.310
in training school for Rangers.

02:26.481 --> 02:29.103
- You still thinking of signing up, Drew?
- I don't know.

02:29.276 --> 02:31.683
I got a buddy at the hospital
I work with who's ex-Ranger.

02:31.862 --> 02:33.570
He says he can put in a good word
for me...

02:33.739 --> 02:35.049
but right now I'm more focused
on medicine.

02:35.073 --> 02:37.066
Bet you're more focused on the nurses.

02:37.242 --> 02:40.741
No lack of hotties in the ER.
So, Javy, what's the deal, huh?

02:40.954 --> 02:43.955
That 15 K march at the end
too tough on the old bones?

02:44.124 --> 02:45.499
That might have
something to do...

02:45.667 --> 02:46.936
with sitting on your lazy ass
in a patrol car all day.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.368
Hey, my wife loves my lazy ass,
so it's all good.

02:49.546 --> 02:51.622
You know why?
That matches her fat ass.

02:51.798 --> 02:53.860
That's the mother of my children.
And I like them curvy.

02:53.884 --> 02:55.295
- Don't you, Drew?
- Oh, yeah.

02:55.469 --> 02:58.138
No, me, I love me the motorboat.
Just... right in there.

02:59.139 --> 03:02.140
Let's get moving. We only have 8 hours
to the rendezvous point.

03:02.351 --> 03:04.888
And then Drew can get back
to those nurses of his.

03:05.896 --> 03:08.766
Let's try moving a little faster
so we can get you a robe.

03:08.940 --> 03:11.776
Do you have paperwork
on those involuntary hold patients...

03:11.985 --> 03:14.310
- from last week?
- It's in a folder on my desk.

03:14.488 --> 03:20.491
<i>Dr. Cahill, extension 3528.
Dr. Cahill, extension 3528.</i>

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.044 --> 03:31.416
<i>Mr. Ragosa to the nurses' station.</i>

03:31.588 --> 03:34.161
<i>Mr. Ragosa, please report
to the nurses' station.</i>

03:35.425 --> 03:37.667
Let's see what's going on
now that he's out.

03:37.844 --> 03:40.406
- There must be 20 fragments in here.
- Distal blood flow is good.

03:40.430 --> 03:41.924
We need to get every one
of those out.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.180
Blood pressure and pulse ox
are dropping.

03:48.146 --> 03:49.475
Massive right heart strain.

03:49.648 --> 03:51.605
A piece of the bullet must
have embolised.

03:51.775 --> 03:53.269
BP's down to 40.

03:53.443 --> 03:55.519
We need to get that bullet out
of the lung now.

03:55.696 --> 03:57.238
Jordan.

03:57.739 --> 03:59.648
I just talked to one
of the paramedics.

03:59.825 --> 04:03.490
And he said this guy came in with
a "Do No Treat" bracelet on his wrist...

04:03.662 --> 04:06.200
- and that you ignored it.
- I need lido with epi one percent.

04:06.373 --> 04:07.973
- Open a chest tray.
- If you did that...

04:08.125 --> 04:11.624
then you have opened yourself and
this hospital up to a major lawsuit.

04:11.795 --> 04:14.666
So please, please,
tell me you didn't do that.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.295
The guy's lying.
There's no bracelet.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.926
Jordan.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.048
He had one. I cut it off.

04:24.850 --> 04:28.550
- Jordan.
- And even if she didn't, I would've.

04:28.729 --> 04:30.555
He was dying
and he needed to be treated.

04:30.731 --> 04:32.723
I agree with you.

04:32.899 --> 04:37.111
But we get him declared
incompetent first, contact Legal.

04:37.279 --> 04:39.948
We don't just cut things off.
I'm sorry...

04:40.115 --> 04:42.784
but I need you to step back
and let TC finish this patient.

04:42.951 --> 04:44.742
You are officially suspended.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.735
You know, I wish one of you fools
was a hot chick.

04:58.759 --> 05:00.653
A little eye candy would be nice
right about now.

05:00.677 --> 05:02.717
What do you mean, man?
This is the best looking...

05:02.888 --> 05:04.927
- Combat Support Team in Texas.
- That's right.

05:05.098 --> 05:06.592
Yeah, right.

05:06.767 --> 05:09.258
Did you guys hear about
that gay dude in C Company?

05:09.436 --> 05:11.844
- I heard a rumour. But who cares?
- I do.

05:12.022 --> 05:14.892
I thought your generation was
supposed to be more open-minded.

05:15.067 --> 05:16.312
All right, look.

05:16.485 --> 05:20.482
I'm getting shot at by some sniper
in Syria or Iraq or wherever, all right?

05:20.655 --> 05:23.277
I don't need a guy who's supposed
to be covering my ass...

05:23.450 --> 05:24.695
checking it out instead.

05:24.868 --> 05:26.679
Yeah, because I'm sure
that's what he's thinking.

05:26.703 --> 05:30.072
"I could die out here right now,
but, man, look at that scrawny...

05:30.248 --> 05:32.040
pimply ass on Charlie."
- Oh, yeah!

05:32.209 --> 05:35.791
Just my opinion, man. And now,
I'm gonna go shoot something.

05:35.962 --> 05:37.505
- This kid.
- Hey!

05:37.673 --> 05:38.752
Charlie, come on!

05:42.427 --> 05:44.799
You don't have to be straight to be
in the Army...

05:44.971 --> 05:48.091
you just have to shoot straight.
That's all I care about, man.

05:48.266 --> 05:49.465
Javy! Watch out!

06:15.669 --> 06:17.229
So she saves a life
and she gets canned?

06:17.337 --> 06:19.662
Nobody is firing her.

06:20.257 --> 06:22.166
God, why is it so hot in here?

06:23.552 --> 06:28.759
Like I said, nobody's firing her.
She's on administrative duty.

06:29.433 --> 06:32.683
I'm taking this precaution
to protect her from any further action.

06:32.853 --> 06:35.308
We'll get him declared incompetent
and go from there.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.891
So I just sit around all night?

06:37.065 --> 06:39.770
You need to stay away
from this patient.

06:39.943 --> 06:43.941
And you need to talk to Legal and hope
to hell Landry finds him incompetent.

06:44.114 --> 06:46.605
After that, whatever you do
with any other patients...

06:46.783 --> 06:48.242
I don't wanna know about it.

06:48.410 --> 06:51.660
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really need a glass of water.

06:52.873 --> 06:56.242
- It'll be okay.
- You don't know that.

06:56.877 --> 06:59.202
I don't have your friends
in high places.

06:59.379 --> 07:02.049
Sorry I put you guys in this position.

07:03.216 --> 07:04.711
Hey. What's going on?

07:04.885 --> 07:06.628
I've never seen Jordan act
like that before.

07:06.803 --> 07:10.053
It's a long story.
Let's get the rest of this shrapnel.

07:12.225 --> 07:14.763
- Javy. Come on.
- Yeah.

07:14.936 --> 07:18.140
- My shoulder! I can barely pull him out!
- Yeah, just sack up, okay?

07:18.315 --> 07:20.224
I gotta sit!

07:23.195 --> 07:25.864
Hey. Okay,
I'm gonna go check on Javy.

07:27.074 --> 07:29.197
- What do we got? What do we got?
- My shoulder.

07:29.368 --> 07:30.862
Okay.

07:31.536 --> 07:34.158
- That really hurts!
- You got a separation of an AC joint.

07:34.331 --> 07:36.205
Drew, Drew, I need you!

07:36.375 --> 07:38.581
I'm coming.
I'm gonna be right there, Mikey.

07:38.752 --> 07:42.085
- Come on, Drew. Come on, Drew.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

07:42.255 --> 07:47.297
- My ankle's screwed up. I'm in pain.
- Hang in there, Mikey, hang in there.

07:47.469 --> 07:48.548
Okay, there we go.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.342
You're good.
I'm gonna get Mikey.

07:52.140 --> 07:54.466
- Wait, wait, wait, where's Charlie?
- Charlie!

07:54.643 --> 07:58.059
Charlie! Charlie!

07:59.147 --> 08:01.167
Javy, I know you're hurting,
but we gotta find Charlie.

08:01.191 --> 08:02.650
- Okay.
- Go.

08:02.818 --> 08:05.487
- Okay, Mikey, I'm here. I'm right here.
- Charlie!

08:10.409 --> 08:13.742
- Is that crazy dude gonna die?
- Just hold still, Sir.

08:13.912 --> 08:15.786
- And I don't know.
- I can't go to jail.

08:15.956 --> 08:19.122
I'd never make it there.
I saw every episode of <i>Oz</i>.

08:19.292 --> 08:21.285
- They eat guys like me alive.
- Yeah, they would.

08:21.461 --> 08:25.411
But I think you're safe. That guy is...
It's pretty clear he's unstable.

08:25.590 --> 08:29.256
General Santa Anna, right?
Sweet costume.

08:29.428 --> 08:31.614
- Any news on the guy I shot?
- They've got him sedated...

08:31.638 --> 08:33.658
- in Trauma One.
- The waiting room is filling up again...

08:33.682 --> 08:36.885
with re-enactors, and we hooked up
some more drunks to the saline packs.

08:37.102 --> 08:39.140
And sent three food poisoned
guys home too.

08:39.312 --> 08:42.977
That rabbit stew is nasty.
That's why I fight on the Mexican side.

08:43.150 --> 08:44.229
We have a food truck.

08:44.401 --> 08:46.892
You guys only have
a couple dozen more patients to go.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.591
I'll join you as soon as I'm finished.

08:48.655 --> 08:50.695
And I'll let you watch me
do one of the EJs.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.329
I've been waiting two hours
to see a doctor.

08:56.496 --> 08:57.907
I know, ma'am. I'm so sorry.

08:58.081 --> 09:00.619
The Alamo re-enactors have us
slammed with patients.

09:00.792 --> 09:01.871
My stomach's killing me.

09:02.836 --> 09:04.663
I'll get you a doctor as soon as I can.

09:07.299 --> 09:08.579
Hey, hey.

09:08.759 --> 09:10.987
You ordered a GI panel on Exam Two,
but haven't seen the patient yet.

09:11.011 --> 09:12.905
- She's pissed.
- Yeah, I know. I read the chart.

09:12.929 --> 09:14.673
It sounds like the stomach flu
or something.

09:14.848 --> 09:16.757
Oh, but Topher's gonna do
an external jugular...

09:16.933 --> 09:18.911
and I really want to watch,
I've never seen one, so...

09:18.935 --> 09:22.518
- But her results are already back.
- Great. I will see her after the EJ.

09:22.689 --> 09:24.765
Just start some fluids, okay? Thanks.

09:24.941 --> 09:27.397
Dispatch? Yeah, this is Dr. Callahan.

09:27.569 --> 09:31.863
There was a Paramedic Gonzalez,
he came in...

09:32.032 --> 09:35.697
with a GSW from the Alamo
at 7:30 tonight.

09:35.869 --> 09:38.158
Can you tell him to come by the ER?

09:38.330 --> 09:41.366
I have some info that he may need.

09:41.541 --> 09:44.791
- Drew. Is it broken?
- And dislocated.

09:44.961 --> 09:47.250
Okay, I'm gonna try
and get your boot off, okay?

09:48.131 --> 09:49.692
Mikey, I just gotta get in there, okay?

09:49.758 --> 09:52.427
I got you... That's right.
Let me get my finger...

09:52.594 --> 09:54.503
Mikey, I can't feel a pulse.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.013
That means the dislocation is
cutting off the blood flow to your foot...

09:58.183 --> 10:00.745
- so I gotta reduce the fracture.
- What the hell does that mean?

10:00.769 --> 10:02.975
It means it's gonna hurt
like a son of a bitch.

10:03.188 --> 10:06.391
Okay, deep breath. Okay?
Count of three?

10:06.566 --> 10:08.773
You with me? One, two...

10:11.738 --> 10:15.606
- Damn you, Drew!
- It's better than dying, all right?

10:16.076 --> 10:17.451
Come on, Javy, where are you?

10:17.619 --> 10:20.537
There's blood dripping down
the back of your neck.

10:20.706 --> 10:22.248
What?

10:23.959 --> 10:26.711
That sucks. Okay.

10:27.587 --> 10:32.131
We're about to get even, Mikey.
Skin stapler, all right?

10:32.300 --> 10:34.756
Self-explanatory.

10:36.430 --> 10:38.837
Push the edges of the wound
together...

10:39.766 --> 10:42.969
apply pressure,
squeeze the trigger.

10:49.818 --> 10:51.360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:53.280 --> 10:58.618
Drew! Drew! I found Charlie.
He's in really bad shape.

10:58.785 --> 11:01.027
We're gonna get Charlie.
Mike, I'll be right back.

11:01.204 --> 11:02.663
You hold on, okay?

11:02.831 --> 11:04.907
You were at the Alamo.
You've been shot.

11:08.295 --> 11:10.786
I can't find her in the computer.
Let me try again.

11:11.089 --> 11:12.168
Can you speak up, sir?

11:14.009 --> 11:16.381
He's incompetent, right?

11:16.553 --> 11:20.088
He's still too out of it from the
anaesthesia for me to make a diagnosis.

11:20.265 --> 11:23.052
I thought I'd check since Jordan
had paged me three times.

11:23.226 --> 11:26.975
- What's going on?
- He's a Christian Scientist.

11:27.147 --> 11:30.267
He came in with a "Do Not Treat"
bracelet. Jordan cut it off.

11:30.442 --> 11:32.066
- What?
- Yeah.

11:32.235 --> 11:34.773
So you declaring him incompetent
would go a long way...

11:34.946 --> 11:36.654
towards getting her off the hook.

11:36.823 --> 11:39.279
Well, first of all,
I can't believe she did that.

11:39.451 --> 11:41.823
But I'm not just gonna label him
without talking.

11:41.995 --> 11:43.537
He was screaming, he was yelling...

11:43.705 --> 11:45.558
That could be for any number
of a hundred things.

11:45.582 --> 11:48.251
Look, I like Jordan,
but I'm not gonna risk my license...

11:48.418 --> 11:51.336
or a malpractice suit by giving
an unwarranted diagnosis.

11:51.505 --> 11:53.793
Especially when she does something
that stupid.

11:53.965 --> 11:57.299
- I would have done the same thing.
- What do you want me to say here, TC?

11:57.469 --> 12:00.386
I don't agree with you on this,
so let's just not talk about it.

12:00.555 --> 12:05.513
He wakes up, I'll make the diagnosis.
But don't tell me how to do my job.

12:05.686 --> 12:08.852
You're right. I'm sorry.

12:14.277 --> 12:19.189
<i>Dr. Jay, call extension 4835.
Dr. Jay, call extension 4835.</i>

12:27.582 --> 12:30.038
<i>Dr. Alexander,
report to the Legal Department.</i>

12:30.210 --> 12:33.959
<i>Dr. Alexander, please report
to the Legal Department.</i>

12:34.131 --> 12:37.582
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- That doesn't look good.

12:37.759 --> 12:39.752
He needs an OR.
Call the TOC, get a Medevac.

12:39.928 --> 12:41.802
The antennae tore off when we rolled.

12:41.972 --> 12:44.463
Radio's shot
and there's no cell signal out here.

12:44.641 --> 12:46.452
- We're on our own.
- I'll try to tamponade the bleeding...

12:46.476 --> 12:48.848
but this packing's just
a temporary fix. Get the litter.

12:49.021 --> 12:50.581
We gotta get up
to the extraction point.

12:50.731 --> 12:53.685
- It's at least five miles.
- Well, then we better get going.

12:56.278 --> 12:57.309
Hang in there, buddy.

13:04.411 --> 13:06.320
<i>Dr. Chandler to MICU.</i>

13:13.045 --> 13:16.295
Mollie says he's been standing
there for the past five minutes.

13:16.465 --> 13:19.715
I figure he's trying to find a way
to save money on electricity.

13:20.927 --> 13:23.881
<i>Custodial services to the ER.</i>

13:24.097 --> 13:25.508
Michael?

13:28.852 --> 13:31.177
I took a couple of pills
from your aspirin bottle...

13:31.355 --> 13:33.076
but I'm pretty sure they
weren't aspirin.

13:33.190 --> 13:34.565
You wanna tell me what it was?

13:34.733 --> 13:37.105
- From the bottle on my desk?
- Yes.

13:38.987 --> 13:41.692
They were MDMA.

13:41.907 --> 13:45.157
MDMA? As in Ecstasy?

13:45.744 --> 13:47.452
- Why do you have?
- I'm so sorry.

13:47.621 --> 13:49.613
I swear there is
a legitimate explanation.

13:49.790 --> 13:50.821
What's happening to me?

13:50.999 --> 13:55.044
Well, your senses are heightening
and you will be more open...

13:55.212 --> 13:58.545
and physical with people
and objects.

13:58.715 --> 14:02.795
No. No, no, no.
This is not happening.

14:04.179 --> 14:06.966
- I can fight this.
- You don't really have control over it.

14:07.140 --> 14:09.678
You should just sit
in your office until it passes.

14:10.894 --> 14:13.183
I am so angry with you right now.

14:13.355 --> 14:15.976
You women are really
messing up my night.

14:16.692 --> 14:20.820
- We're gonna deal with this later.
- Okay. Drink a lot of water.

14:20.987 --> 14:22.482
Water.

14:25.242 --> 14:28.278
- Ragosa's on Ecstasy? No, how...
- Okay.

14:28.453 --> 14:32.154
So I was involved in an experimental
study on the effects of MDMA...

14:32.332 --> 14:35.831
on soldiers with PTSD, and the drug,
it just, it releases serotonin...

14:36.003 --> 14:40.463
and oxytocin so the soldiers can
relive their trauma without feeling pain.

14:40.632 --> 14:43.752
- Oh. Okay.
- Please keep this on the DL.

14:44.678 --> 14:46.421
Gotcha, yeah, gotcha.

14:46.596 --> 14:48.174
Mike's gonna be fine back there.

14:48.348 --> 14:51.135
I know your shoulder's killing you,
but you gotta keep up.

14:51.309 --> 14:54.145
- Charlie is in bad shape.
- I'm trying, man.

14:54.312 --> 14:57.728
- You think he's gonna make it?
- I don't know.

14:58.358 --> 14:59.983
He can't die, man, he's just a kid.

15:00.152 --> 15:03.106
I've seen a lot of kids die.
Age has got nothing to do with it.

15:03.280 --> 15:07.112
I gotta tell you, Drew.
I wanna quit this whole Army thing.

15:07.284 --> 15:10.368
I just joined the Reserves to get some
extra cash for my wife and kids.

15:10.537 --> 15:14.535
I don't want to get killed.
Aren't you afraid of getting killed?

15:14.708 --> 15:18.041
No one wants to die, Javy,
but if I think about that out there...

15:18.211 --> 15:20.916
I'm not gonna be able to do my job
as a medic.

15:24.593 --> 15:26.253
Why are we stopping?

15:27.721 --> 15:30.129
Javy, we're on the range.
The firing range.

15:30.307 --> 15:32.798
Go, go, go, go, go!
Move, move, move!

15:40.734 --> 15:42.193
Let's get the hell out of here!

15:43.278 --> 15:46.861
Mollie, I need to see if anyone filled out
a missing person report on John Doe.

15:47.032 --> 15:49.784
- Can you call S.A.P. D?
- I'm on it.

15:50.911 --> 15:54.529
- Maybe we shouldn't call S.A.P.D.
- We always do that with John Does.

15:54.706 --> 15:57.114
We have no idea what his medical
or psychiatric history is.

15:57.292 --> 15:58.686
His family could be looking for him.

15:58.710 --> 16:01.913
His family, more likely than not,
are the ones that will let him die.

16:02.130 --> 16:04.621
- You don't know that.
- They're Christian Scientists...

16:04.800 --> 16:07.504
which means they are gonna wanna
stop any treatment...

16:07.678 --> 16:11.212
that you or I want to do and
that man will needlessly suffer.

16:11.390 --> 16:13.368
Just let me do my job, okay?
Don't get all pissy at me...

16:13.392 --> 16:15.244
because you screwed up
and cut off his bracelet.

16:15.268 --> 16:17.344
- He was dying.
- Yeah, that's what he wanted.

16:17.521 --> 16:19.457
That's why he wore the bracelet.
That's his choice.

16:19.481 --> 16:21.723
To die when he can easily be saved?
You're backing that?

16:21.900 --> 16:23.442
I'm backing personal freedom.

16:23.610 --> 16:27.442
I'm backing nobody telling anybody
what they can do with their body.

16:27.614 --> 16:30.485
Would I ever do that? No.
But I believe in his right to believe it.

16:30.659 --> 16:32.319
He may not know what he believes.

16:32.494 --> 16:34.094
You didn't know that
when you cut it off.

16:34.204 --> 16:36.244
You saw his religion
and you made a choice.

16:36.415 --> 16:38.573
Maybe that guy is incompetent,
but what if he wasn't?

16:38.750 --> 16:41.585
What if he was just a lawyer who had
a different belief than yours?

16:41.753 --> 16:42.832
Would you still do it?

16:43.005 --> 16:44.831
Every single time
they're brought in here.

16:45.007 --> 16:47.129
Well, then I guess
we just see things differently.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.210
On a lot of things.

16:49.594 --> 16:51.053
- What does that mean?
- Forget it.

16:51.221 --> 16:53.130
No, say it.

16:55.183 --> 16:56.761
Okay.

16:57.394 --> 16:59.470
It means that I know
you're sleeping with TC.

17:00.022 --> 17:02.310
And that's fine, it's not my business.

17:02.482 --> 17:04.585
But I can't believe after some
of the conversations...

17:04.608 --> 17:06.849
that you and I have had about me,
him, and our past...

17:06.987 --> 17:09.821
that you never once thought
that maybe you should mention it.

17:12.617 --> 17:14.409
I need a doctor in here.

17:16.121 --> 17:18.410
- My chest. I can't breathe.
- Okay.

17:18.582 --> 17:21.368
- Heart rate's in the 30s.
- All right. Okay, okay.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.536
I'm gonna listen to your heart.

17:24.671 --> 17:27.209
There are ST elevations.
This woman is having a heart attack.

17:27.382 --> 17:29.589
- Why hasn't she been seen?
- I thought she had.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.918
Page Cardiology.
Give me 325 milligrams of aspirin...

17:32.095 --> 17:34.421
and grab the pacer pads.
We need a formal EKG, now.

17:34.598 --> 17:36.674
- She already had one.
- Well, who ordered it?

17:36.850 --> 17:38.843
- What happened?
- Is this your patient?

17:39.019 --> 17:42.186
- Yeah, she had the stomach flu.
- And did you order an EKG on her?

17:42.356 --> 17:46.649
- I did, as part of a GI workup.
- And did you look at it?

17:46.818 --> 17:50.068
You have an African-American woman
in her late 40s with diabetes...

17:50.238 --> 17:52.508
complaining about stomach pains,
and you didn't look at her EKG?

17:52.532 --> 17:54.525
She should have been in a Cath lab
two hours ago.

17:54.701 --> 17:56.243
She wasn't complaining
of chest pains.

17:56.411 --> 17:59.098
It doesn't matter. If you order a test,
you're responsible for the results.

17:59.122 --> 18:01.827
And if that test is an EKG,
you look at it, immediately.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.498
- Inferior MI.
- Paul, you're an ER doctor.

18:05.671 --> 18:08.107
Your job is to think of things
that will kill your patient first...

18:08.131 --> 18:11.666
and label it as benign later.
It isn't all about the flashy procedures.

18:11.843 --> 18:14.002
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologise to me.

18:14.179 --> 18:15.839
Learn. Do better.

18:20.977 --> 18:23.515
I told you to look at the tests, man.

18:26.149 --> 18:29.316
I wanna give you the heads up.
Jordan knows about us.

18:29.486 --> 18:30.945
- How?
- I don't know.

18:31.113 --> 18:33.817
We were arguing about John Doe,
big deal, we see it differently.

18:33.990 --> 18:37.774
- And then it just came out.
- All right.

18:37.953 --> 18:41.238
- You want me to talk to her?
- No, I can fight my own battles.

18:41.415 --> 18:44.166
Aside from tonight,
she has every right to be pissed at me.

18:44.334 --> 18:47.252
We were becoming friends.
You're her ex. I should've told her.

18:47.462 --> 18:49.455
TC, Paramedic Gonzalez is here
to see you.

18:49.965 --> 18:52.456
- John Doe ready?
- Yeah, he's coherent now.

18:53.802 --> 18:55.960
Hey, buddy, thanks for coming by.

18:56.138 --> 18:57.929
My union rep said
I shouldn't talk to you.

18:58.098 --> 18:59.509
Your union rep is a douche.

18:59.683 --> 19:02.304
Is he on the front lines
like you and me? No.

19:02.477 --> 19:04.803
Let's talk about what you really saw.

19:05.939 --> 19:07.979
I have to determine
your competency...

19:08.150 --> 19:10.771
so I need you to focus
and think really hard.

19:11.111 --> 19:12.274
What's your name?

19:14.072 --> 19:19.493
I don't know. I don't know who I am.
Please help me. Please.

19:19.661 --> 19:21.868
It's all right, I'm gonna help you.

19:22.039 --> 19:25.123
I'm gonna show you some pictures.
It's a test to help you remember.

19:25.292 --> 19:27.368
Let me know if anything
seems familiar.

19:27.544 --> 19:29.702
It doesn't matter
if it's the smallest thing.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.505
- Anything?
- No.

19:50.025 --> 19:52.646
Wait, wait, go back.

19:53.528 --> 19:55.320
What does this make you think of?

19:57.866 --> 19:59.194
- A diner.
- Good.

19:59.368 --> 20:00.696
You like diners?

20:02.412 --> 20:05.413
Yeah, I think I ate there, at a diner.

20:05.582 --> 20:07.124
Anything else?

20:09.169 --> 20:10.829
Chris... Christine.

20:11.380 --> 20:13.123
You remember someone
named Christine?

20:13.298 --> 20:15.421
Yeah, Christine.

20:19.262 --> 20:23.011
But I don't remember
what she looks like or who she is.

20:23.183 --> 20:25.389
I don't remember anything else.

20:28.021 --> 20:30.310
Why is this happening to me?

20:31.274 --> 20:32.555
Who am I?

20:32.734 --> 20:35.059
I know it's scary,
but we're gonna figure this out.

20:35.237 --> 20:38.191
And we'll find whoever's looking
for you. I promise.

20:48.834 --> 20:52.250
- All right, all clear, let's move.
- Charlie's bleeding again.

20:53.964 --> 20:55.838
- Damn it.
- What's happened?

20:57.968 --> 21:00.838
Part of the bowel has ruptured.
I gotta suture that bleeder.

21:01.847 --> 21:05.132
This is why you're not going
for Ranger, right? It's not worth it.

21:05.308 --> 21:09.140
We could be killed and for what?
Protecting some damn dictator?

21:09.312 --> 21:11.352
Or this stupid kid? He's an idiot.

21:11.523 --> 21:13.668
He wouldn't be hurt so bad
if he wasn't firing that stupid gun.

21:13.692 --> 21:16.099
Javy, he can hear you, shut up.
Now is not the time.

21:19.114 --> 21:21.985
Is Christine an Alamo re-enactor
like you?

21:22.159 --> 21:23.321
Doctor?

21:25.537 --> 21:28.621
S.A.P.D. Doesn't have a missing person
fitting John Doe's description...

21:28.790 --> 21:31.412
and I left messages
at the Christian Science churches.

21:31.585 --> 21:34.502
Good. He just mentioned a diner
and a girl named Christine.

21:34.671 --> 21:37.506
Either he took her on a date
there once or she works there.

21:37.674 --> 21:40.296
I'm hoping it's the latter. Can you?

21:40.469 --> 21:42.710
Call all the 24-hour
diners in the area?

21:42.971 --> 21:45.545
I'll help. How many can there be?

21:45.974 --> 21:47.634
Get TC.

21:48.518 --> 21:49.763
TC!

21:52.022 --> 21:53.583
- What happened?
- He was fine and then...

21:53.607 --> 21:54.968
his vitals started going crazy.

21:55.025 --> 21:56.336
Maybe it's another embolus
to the lung.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.920
We got rid of all the shrapnel.
It must be something else.

21:57.944 --> 22:00.233
- Push 150 mgs. Amiodarone.
- On it.

22:00.405 --> 22:02.896
Wait, wait, wait. Too late.
Look at his blood pressure.

22:04.659 --> 22:06.118
Clear.

22:08.622 --> 22:09.736
Back in a sinus rhythm.

22:10.916 --> 22:13.323
- Pressure's up to 105.
- What the hell was that?

22:13.502 --> 22:15.743
I have no idea.

22:23.428 --> 22:27.640
She's probably not going to wake up
for another hour or so, doctor.

22:28.016 --> 22:33.390
That's all right.
I'll just sit with her until she does.

22:49.246 --> 22:52.781
Okay, so we need a stat chest CT
and add on a tox panel.

22:52.958 --> 22:54.582
Right away.

22:55.377 --> 23:00.454
That was close. So, what did you learn
before he started to code?

23:00.632 --> 23:02.376
It looks like a mania-induced
fugue state.

23:02.551 --> 23:04.779
Based on the retrograde amnesia,
his aggressive behaviour...

23:04.803 --> 23:07.323
- towards the re-enactors...
- This case is even more complicated.

23:07.347 --> 23:09.506
For now. It's a tricky condition.

23:09.683 --> 23:11.640
It could be caused
by any number of things.

23:11.810 --> 23:14.301
It could last for hours
or even months.

23:14.479 --> 23:15.974
We need to find out who he is.

23:16.148 --> 23:18.918
And I know that doesn't help Jordan
if he does have family that could sue...

23:18.942 --> 23:21.433
No, trust me, Jordan cares more
about this guy living...

23:21.611 --> 23:25.230
than any trouble she's in. But if
they try to can her for it, I'll quit.

23:25.407 --> 23:27.364
That'll get the board's attention.

23:27.659 --> 23:31.527
You'd really quit?
That's very loyal.

23:31.705 --> 23:35.572
I'm gonna go check on the labs,
see if there's anything I missed.

23:44.509 --> 23:47.629
- Yo, yo, what up, Tony?
- Hey, Dr. Topher.

23:47.804 --> 23:49.565
We got a great special tonight.
Check it out.

23:50.891 --> 23:52.089
I see what you did there.

23:52.267 --> 23:54.260
You want my advice
on your vasectomy?

23:54.436 --> 23:58.101
Yeah, I was just too shy to ask.
Just a burger and fries, Tony, let's go.

23:58.273 --> 23:59.815
- Hey, Topher. Hey.
- Hey.

23:59.983 --> 24:02.557
Your crappy night still going crappy?

24:02.736 --> 24:05.061
You sure do know what to say
to a girl to cheer her up.

24:05.238 --> 24:07.148
- It's a gift.
- Yeah. Okay.

24:07.324 --> 24:11.452
Now you know, when the lawyers
ask you if you'd do it again...

24:11.620 --> 24:15.949
- the answer is no. Right?
- Yeah.

24:16.124 --> 24:17.916
I probably could've handled
that better.

24:18.085 --> 24:19.365
Dr. Topher.

24:19.544 --> 24:21.336
- Hey, can I get a coffee?
- You got it.

24:24.216 --> 24:26.837
I thought you might wanna know,
I declared John Doe incompetent.

24:27.010 --> 24:29.881
- It wasn't rocket science.
- I needed to examine him, Jordan.

24:30.055 --> 24:31.929
- Yeah, okay.
- You wouldn't rubber stamp...

24:32.099 --> 24:34.056
any diagnosis I gave
without checking.

24:35.394 --> 24:38.928
Look, I know I didn't handle
this whole thing with TC very well.

24:39.106 --> 24:42.272
- I should've said something to you.
- Yeah, you probably should have.

24:42.442 --> 24:44.045
Considering that you had at least
72 chances...

24:44.069 --> 24:45.588
to tell me that you were sleeping
with my ex.

24:45.612 --> 24:48.293
But you could have told me before
I set you up on that blind date...

24:48.323 --> 24:50.861
which, in retrospect,
is totally bizarre that you went.

24:51.034 --> 24:53.656
I wanted to get to know you better.
That's why I went.

24:54.496 --> 24:57.034
Anyway, TC and I aren't that serious.

24:57.207 --> 25:01.371
Landry, what you and TC do
or don't do is really not my concern.

25:01.545 --> 25:03.668
- Now you're being dishonest.
- Excuse me?

25:03.839 --> 25:06.127
You work in a hospital
with your ex-boyfriend.

25:06.299 --> 25:08.292
You actively pursued to manage
his shift...

25:08.468 --> 25:10.959
all while your current boyfriend
lives in Dallas.

25:11.138 --> 25:13.925
- Yeah. That's where Scott works.
- Jordan, this is psych 101.

25:14.099 --> 25:16.590
You have no interest in really
committing to Scott...

25:16.768 --> 25:19.259
because you still have feelings
for ex-boyfriend, TC.

25:19.438 --> 25:22.189
TC isn't just an ex-boyfriend, okay?

25:22.357 --> 25:25.420
He isn't some guy that I dated for a
little while and it just didn't work out.

25:25.444 --> 25:27.839
- I understand you have history.
- You have no idea what we have.

25:27.863 --> 25:29.820
TC was a wreck when he came home.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.470
He wasn't the man that you see today.

25:31.533 --> 25:34.700
I left my job, my friends, everything...

25:34.870 --> 25:36.909
so that I could come here
and help him out.

25:37.080 --> 25:42.786
I stood by him through hell.
So, yeah, we have a history.

25:42.961 --> 25:45.333
And, yes, I have feelings for him.

25:49.176 --> 25:51.797
- Fries?
- No.

25:52.346 --> 25:55.263
Mollie, you found John Doe's
Christine?

25:56.183 --> 26:01.141
Topher! This is my jam!
This is my jam!

26:07.152 --> 26:09.228
- Doc?
- I'm here, Charlie.

26:09.404 --> 26:12.773
I can't go anymore.

26:12.949 --> 26:16.568
- Hurts too much. Put me down.
- Hey, Javy, put him down.

26:16.745 --> 26:20.577
Count of three. One, two, three.

26:23.251 --> 26:25.078
Let me take a look.

26:26.838 --> 26:28.961
Hey, you're looking great, man.

26:29.132 --> 26:33.212
- I'm telling you, you look spectacular.
- I'm serious. I give up.

26:33.387 --> 26:35.712
I need you to keep fighting,
you understand me?

26:35.889 --> 26:38.214
Keep fighting.
You can do it, Charlie.

26:38.392 --> 26:41.511
Okay. Up on the count of three.

26:41.687 --> 26:44.806
One, two, three.

26:46.858 --> 26:49.646
- Charlie, you all right? Javy?
- Yeah. I'm right.

26:49.820 --> 26:53.402
- Hold on. My shoulder.
- Here, here.

26:54.116 --> 26:55.491
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:57.452 --> 26:59.806
We don't get him there in the next hour
he's not gonna make it.

26:59.830 --> 27:01.430
You gotta keep him talking,
distract him.

27:01.540 --> 27:02.738
Copy that.

27:06.086 --> 27:10.249
Okay, up on three.
One, two, three.

27:17.556 --> 27:19.383
Hey.

27:19.558 --> 27:21.319
You know I'm not supposed
to be treating him.

27:21.435 --> 27:22.977
Yeah, well, I need your brain.

27:23.145 --> 27:25.552
His vitals went wonky.
I can't figure it out.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.056
Chest CT came back with nothing,
all right?

27:28.233 --> 27:31.353
Now he's spiking a fever
and he isn't responding to antibiotics.

27:31.528 --> 27:34.066
- I think the leg must be getting septic.
- Okay.

27:34.239 --> 27:35.698
But he's already
on two antibiotics.

27:35.866 --> 27:38.617
I've added a third,
I've resent his blood cultures...

27:39.745 --> 27:41.737
- His fever's climbing.
- Cooling measures, now.

27:41.913 --> 27:44.665
And now he's twitching.
What the hell is going on?

27:44.833 --> 27:48.451
Okay, okay, it could be meningitis
or tetanus from the bullet. Right?

27:48.628 --> 27:51.416
- Maybe. Dystonic reaction?
- Yes.

27:51.590 --> 27:53.443
I just got off the phone
with a woman who knows him.

27:53.467 --> 27:55.127
She said he was fine
three weeks ago.

27:55.302 --> 27:57.572
His fugue state has to be
connected to his worsening condition.

27:57.596 --> 27:58.924
- In what way?
- I'm not sure.

27:59.097 --> 28:02.715
When you have something that
could really help us, let us know.

28:02.893 --> 28:07.056
- Thanks. Okay.
- Jordan.

28:07.230 --> 28:09.389
Jordan. Push 150 milligrams
amiodarone.

28:10.942 --> 28:15.604
Aggies over UT? What, are you crazy?
What else you got, Javy?

28:15.781 --> 28:19.114
Hey, Charlie, if you could snap
your fingers and be anywhere...

28:19.284 --> 28:21.443
- where would you be, buddy?
- I don't know.

28:21.620 --> 28:23.494
Yeah, you do, man.
Where do you wanna go?

28:23.663 --> 28:26.783
I'm thinking Vegas with all
the chickies, little bit of booze, huh?

28:27.084 --> 28:30.038
- In the Gulf, catching marlins.
- Love it.

28:30.212 --> 28:33.628
- How about you, Javy?
- Oh, Miami Beach, baby.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.468
Drinking margaritas
with my wife by the pool.

28:36.635 --> 28:38.509
Have my parents
take the kids for the week.

28:38.679 --> 28:41.596
That'd be a vacation.
How about you?

28:41.765 --> 28:43.841
Oh, man, I love the old cities.

28:44.017 --> 28:45.096
You got Paris, Rome.

28:45.268 --> 28:47.557
Just the history of them,
learning about them.

28:47.729 --> 28:50.054
Me and Rick, we usually
end up in Hawaii, though.

28:50.232 --> 28:53.233
My brother, Rick.
I vacation a lot with my brother.

28:53.402 --> 28:55.275
We're close.

28:56.780 --> 28:58.607
- Hawaii's cool.
- Yeah.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.150
Hang on, Charlie. Hang on.

29:03.036 --> 29:06.785
<i>Mr. Ragosa, please report to Records.
Mr. Ragosa, please report to Records.</i>

29:06.957 --> 29:09.199
It's positivity.

29:09.376 --> 29:11.914
Oh, man, this is where it's at.

29:12.087 --> 29:18.125
I just feel really, really, really good.

29:18.301 --> 29:20.923
Kenny told me that Ragosa
accidentally took some E...

29:21.096 --> 29:24.679
and he's just been rolling all night.

29:24.850 --> 29:28.301
You should... You should really
go back to work.

29:30.397 --> 29:33.018
Yeah. Right.

29:34.359 --> 29:40.195
I really see you, I see you!
Remember the Alamo!

29:41.616 --> 29:44.736
John Doe's lumbar puncture
and tetanus titer are negative.

29:44.911 --> 29:46.904
But his fever keeps going up.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.287
And he keeps spasming.

29:51.710 --> 29:55.293
- What are we missing?
- Been asking myself for hours.

29:56.340 --> 29:59.874
Maybe you shouldn't
have jumped all over Landry.

30:00.052 --> 30:02.625
Is now really the time to talk about that?

30:02.804 --> 30:04.714
I'm talking about saving John Doe.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.297
Look, we have no idea
what's wrong with him.

30:07.476 --> 30:10.311
- She was just trying to help.
- By throwing out theories?

30:10.479 --> 30:12.270
Well, that is what we're doing.

30:13.982 --> 30:16.438
I know this has been
a rough night for you.

30:16.735 --> 30:21.527
If you want to talk,
I know you're with Scott and all...

30:23.075 --> 30:26.029
but you can come to me any time.

30:26.203 --> 30:28.610
- You know that, right?
- I'm fine.

30:30.749 --> 30:32.409
But you're right.

30:33.377 --> 30:35.416
It's just been a really tough night.

30:37.255 --> 30:39.047
I'm gonna re-check his labs.

30:39.216 --> 30:41.458
How many times
did you stick this guy?

30:41.635 --> 30:43.212
Five. And a half.

30:43.387 --> 30:44.466
His vein keeps moving.

30:44.638 --> 30:47.343
It's literally like trying to stick
Jabba the Hutt.

30:47.516 --> 30:50.470
Maybe after two tries
you come find me next time.

30:50.644 --> 30:52.850
Especially after the night
you've had, Paul.

30:53.021 --> 30:55.346
Let's hope he doesn't
have a heart attack too.

30:55.857 --> 30:59.273
Hello, sir. I'm Dr. Zia.
Let me see if I can help you.

30:59.444 --> 31:01.651
These kids don't know
what they're doing.

31:01.822 --> 31:04.443
Well, your veins do present
a challenge.

31:04.616 --> 31:08.863
Look over to the left
and hold your breath, please.

31:09.037 --> 31:11.528
Are you the doctor getting
his huevos snipped?

31:11.707 --> 31:13.249
I didn't say anything, I swear.

31:13.417 --> 31:15.395
He didn't. He blushes whenever
anyone mentions balls.

31:15.419 --> 31:19.499
Never get a vasectomy.
I got snipped.

31:19.673 --> 31:24.750
Damn doctor said it would
only hurt for a couple of days. Liar!

31:24.928 --> 31:28.262
Felt like somebody put a blowtorch
on my man meat.

31:28.432 --> 31:30.175
I could barely walk.

31:30.350 --> 31:32.675
And things were never the same again
in the bedroom.

31:32.853 --> 31:35.095
You know what I mean?

31:35.272 --> 31:37.208
That could've been caused
by any number of conditions.

31:37.232 --> 31:43.021
Nope. I used to wake up every morning
with a flagpole until I got the Big V.

31:44.448 --> 31:46.903
Now I'm taking ED pills
by the truckload...

31:47.075 --> 31:48.949
just to get a little movement.

31:50.328 --> 31:52.736
Sorry.

31:52.914 --> 31:56.615
Over here! We need some help,
there was an accident!

31:56.793 --> 32:00.838
He needs a Medevac,
get the chopper here, now! Down.

32:03.759 --> 32:07.377
Hey, Charlie! You made it!
You'll be in the hospital in no time.

32:07.554 --> 32:10.306
- I'll come by and check on you.
- Thanks, doc.

32:10.474 --> 32:13.095
You should go for Rangers, man.

32:13.268 --> 32:15.973
They'd be lucky to have a guy
like you.

32:17.314 --> 32:19.556
All right, get him out of here.

32:19.733 --> 32:22.603
- Bring him in here.
- Okay.

32:22.778 --> 32:25.482
I spoke to Operations about Mike.
They already got him.

32:25.655 --> 32:28.941
- He had it easy.
- Yeah. No doubt.

32:29.117 --> 32:31.489
Get that shoulder looked at,
you might need surgery.

32:31.661 --> 32:33.321
Sure.

32:33.497 --> 32:34.825
You know...

32:35.457 --> 32:37.117
Charlie can be an idiot.

32:37.292 --> 32:39.866
I bet he's around gay guys all the time
and doesn't even know it.

32:40.045 --> 32:43.995
He's right about one thing, though.
You'd make one hell of a Ranger.

32:45.550 --> 32:47.958
It's a pleasure serving with you,
lieutenant.

32:54.518 --> 32:57.637
Dr. Alexander, this is Christine.

32:57.813 --> 33:00.386
She was John Doe's-,
George's girlfriend.

33:00.565 --> 33:04.777
- He has bipolar disorder.
- Yeah, that's actually why we broke up.

33:04.945 --> 33:07.815
- It just got really hard to deal with.
- I'm sorry, you said bipolar?

33:07.989 --> 33:10.029
Christine, was he on
any kind of medication?

33:10.200 --> 33:13.818
Well, he was, but he hated
the side effects of it.

33:13.995 --> 33:17.115
So that's why he came to our church,
to try a more holistic approach.

33:17.332 --> 33:19.325
Okay, do you remember
what kind if was?

33:19.543 --> 33:21.535
- It was...
- Lithium.

33:21.712 --> 33:25.163
- When did he go off it?
- Maybe like a month ago.

33:26.299 --> 33:28.339
I think I know
what's going on with George.

33:28.510 --> 33:29.673
Excuse me.

33:30.303 --> 33:31.466
Get the pharmacy, now.

33:38.770 --> 33:40.679
He's having a seizure.
A gram of Dilantin, now.

33:40.856 --> 33:43.311
- He's going into V-tach again.
- Pulse ox is dropping.

33:43.483 --> 33:44.646
Hand me the ambu bag.

33:46.194 --> 33:49.029
Bolus 25 migs of dantrolene
and start him on a versed drip.

33:49.197 --> 33:52.115
Hang a bag of D five half
with three amps bicarb. He's bipolar.

33:52.284 --> 33:54.739
He stopped taking lithium abruptly
two weeks ago.

33:54.911 --> 33:57.140
When you don't slowly
wean yourself off mood stabilisers...

33:57.164 --> 33:59.405
It causes
neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

33:59.583 --> 34:01.706
- Nice catch.
- It wasn't all me.

34:01.877 --> 34:05.246
So his fugue state was connected
to his condition, huh?

34:05.422 --> 34:07.664
I guess you did need
a psychiatrist after all.

34:11.762 --> 34:13.838
I missed something juicy, didn't I?

34:17.059 --> 34:18.138
Yeah.

34:19.353 --> 34:23.433
Christine, look, I know that you don't
believe in medical treatment, but...

34:23.607 --> 34:26.561
Actually, I do believe in it.
I go to doctors if I need them.

34:26.735 --> 34:31.148
I just prefer to try prayer first.
Thanks for saving George.

34:39.121 --> 34:41.161
Landry, hey, hold on a second.

34:44.543 --> 34:48.494
I'm sorry for jumping on you earlier.
It was uncalled for.

34:48.674 --> 34:52.422
You helped save George
and I couldn't have done it without you.

34:52.594 --> 34:54.918
Anything else?

34:57.099 --> 34:59.056
Look...

35:01.687 --> 35:03.560
This case really pushed my buttons.

35:04.690 --> 35:08.438
When I was 15, my father contracted
severe pneumonia.

35:08.610 --> 35:11.646
He needed antibiotics
and eventually surgery.

35:11.822 --> 35:16.531
And it was very treatable
but he wouldn't do it.

35:16.702 --> 35:22.407
He just wanted to pray.
And my mother agreed.

35:26.670 --> 35:30.253
- So I watched him die.
- I had no idea.

35:32.300 --> 35:34.626
And then you decided to be a doctor.

35:36.847 --> 35:39.420
Something like that.

35:39.599 --> 35:42.553
I am really, truly sorry for being
such a bitch to you.

35:42.728 --> 35:47.306
And this isn't an excuse for my
behaviour, it's just an explanation.

35:47.482 --> 35:49.309
Well, it's a damn good one.

35:49.484 --> 35:53.268
You should have just told me that,
it would've helped.

35:53.447 --> 35:57.740
But look, I'm sorry too.
About everything.

35:57.909 --> 36:01.243
I don't know
that we'll ever be best friends...

36:01.413 --> 36:05.031
but I'd like to try
to at least be work friends.

36:07.169 --> 36:10.004
Okay.
I can live with that.

36:10.964 --> 36:13.171
- Okay.
- All right.

36:18.764 --> 36:21.848
You look so handsome.
How was drill?

36:22.893 --> 36:24.470
Uneventful.

36:24.644 --> 36:28.345
Have you seen TC? I want to talk to him
about that Ranger recommendation.

36:28.523 --> 36:31.061
I thought you were leaning
on not going for Ranger.

36:31.234 --> 36:32.812
I was.

36:32.986 --> 36:36.521
I just think I might need them
as much as they probably need me.

36:36.698 --> 36:38.192
Hold up.

36:39.993 --> 36:42.152
Oh, uneventful, huh?

36:42.329 --> 36:45.780
Hey, I want to hear every detail,
Lieutenant Bad Ass.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.281
That's nasty.

36:48.460 --> 36:51.995
Yeah, I figured I'd let Krista and Paul
stitch it up, get some practise in.

36:52.172 --> 36:54.330
- Nice and neat.
- Yes, sir.

36:54.508 --> 36:58.837
- Speaking of, where is he? Paul?
- He's probably sulking.

36:59.012 --> 37:00.839
He got spanked by Jordan tonight.

37:01.014 --> 37:03.339
That's how you know-it-alls learn.

37:03.517 --> 37:05.426
Come on.
There's something we have to do.

37:05.602 --> 37:07.061
Yeah.

37:08.355 --> 37:11.107
- Hey, Jordan, better hurry up.
- Why?

37:11.274 --> 37:14.275
Well, it might involve cake,
is all I'm saying.

37:17.948 --> 37:20.735
You guys, I can't believe you...

37:22.953 --> 37:25.444
- Soccer balls?
- Yeah, they're for Topher.

37:25.622 --> 37:27.781
- It's symbolic of his operation.
- Yum.

37:27.958 --> 37:29.500
Hey, he's coming, he's coming.

37:29.668 --> 37:32.040
Surprise!

37:36.466 --> 37:39.088
It's like a nightmare come true.

37:39.261 --> 37:42.345
- Thank you, I think.
- Those are actual size, right?

37:42.514 --> 37:45.717
- Topher, Urology's ready for you.
- All right.

37:47.811 --> 37:49.720
You sure you want to do this, buddy?

37:49.896 --> 37:52.103
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:53.358 --> 37:56.893
- Dead man walking!
- Right. That's funny.

38:05.954 --> 38:08.908
That's, that's nice.
Thank you.

38:09.082 --> 38:12.368
Everybody's here.
And nobody is with the patients.

38:12.544 --> 38:15.830
Fantastic.
Back to work, everyone.

38:23.138 --> 38:25.131
Jordan, I just got a call from Legal.

38:25.307 --> 38:28.427
They wanted me to tell you the
paramedic has changed his story.

38:28.602 --> 38:31.686
He says he can't swear that
it was a "Do Not Treat" bracelet...

38:31.855 --> 38:34.690
and it could have been a FuelBand
or something like that.

38:34.858 --> 38:38.144
- Why would he do that?
- I could make a guess.

38:53.627 --> 38:57.411
- How are you feeling?
- Actually, I'm fine.

38:58.757 --> 39:01.877
- It was enlightening.
- It can be.

39:02.052 --> 39:05.053
You know, I never told anybody this...

39:05.222 --> 39:08.388
but I have some degenerative issues
with my left eye.

39:09.393 --> 39:11.350
You do know how to keep a secret.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.770
- How bad is it?
- Partial blindness.

39:14.940 --> 39:18.523
And now the headaches are getting
worse because of the blurred vision.

39:18.902 --> 39:20.811
I've been delaying
corrective surgery.

39:20.987 --> 39:23.146
- Why?
- Fear.

39:24.574 --> 39:29.782
Now I think it's time I take care of it.
I'm getting a divorce.

39:30.956 --> 39:34.241
I worked it out with my ex
so I can see my kids.

39:36.003 --> 39:39.502
It's a new chapter.
I'm starting over.

39:40.757 --> 39:44.043
Well, that's a healthy attitude.
You're making progress.

39:44.219 --> 39:46.888
You care to talk
about it over breakfast?

39:50.392 --> 39:52.349
I'm not asking you out.

39:52.519 --> 39:55.473
Considerate it punishment for not
labelling your meds properly.

39:56.523 --> 39:59.014
All right. Let's do it.

40:06.033 --> 40:08.606
It's so good to hear your voice.

40:08.785 --> 40:11.111
I just had the worst night ever and...

40:11.288 --> 40:13.197
Yeah, well this guy came in
and it was...

40:13.665 --> 40:16.702
What? What do you mean
you want me to hang up?

40:16.877 --> 40:19.961
Because the world's best boyfriend
is standing right over here.

40:23.633 --> 40:25.673
You planned this whole thing,
didn't you?

40:25.844 --> 40:27.089
Yes, I did.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.556
I missed you.

40:36.104 --> 40:37.978
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Thank you.

40:38.148 --> 40:39.607
Make a wish.

40:51.661 --> 40:54.235
I knew someone
would remember my birthday.
