00:59.026 --> 01:00.961
Hello, everybody!

01:01.028 --> 01:03.497
Hello! Hello!

01:07.535 --> 01:09.737
Hello!

01:10.871 --> 01:12.773
Thank you so much.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.009
What a welcome.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.179
Hello. Thank you, everyone.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.381
Welcome to The Grand Tour,

01:20.448 --> 01:23.951
which this week comes to you
from the shores of Loch Ness

01:24.017 --> 01:27.721
in Scotland!

01:27.788 --> 01:28.989
Now...

01:29.056 --> 01:30.291
Exactly.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.059
Now, to most people
around the world,

01:32.160 --> 01:34.662
Scotland is just
a bunch of scenery

01:34.728 --> 01:37.298
and Mel Gibson with some
paint on his face.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.900
But actually it's
a bit more than that.

01:39.967 --> 01:43.070
What we have here is a list
of all the important things

01:43.171 --> 01:45.072
that were invented
in America, OK?

01:45.173 --> 01:47.508
This is what the Germans
came up with.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.877
Then we've got
the English contribution.

01:49.943 --> 01:53.414
And then let's have
a look at what France did.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.918
That's it.
I'm not making that up.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.086
- And the pencil sharpener.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.654
- Oh, and the pencil sharpener!

02:00.721 --> 02:03.657
Now let's have a look
at the list of things

02:03.724 --> 02:06.394
that were invented
by Scottish people.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.662
It's just...!

02:10.598 --> 02:12.633
It's unbelievable!
It's everything!

02:12.700 --> 02:16.570
Cordite. Cloning.
Colour photography.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.472
Percussion cap.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.309
Golf, lime cordial. I mean,
the list goes on and on.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.312
- Buick!
- Hang on a minute.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.780
Why is the US Navy on there?

02:26.847 --> 02:30.484
Not joking, that was
actually invented by
a Scottish person.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.387
- Was it?
- So was the BBC,
so was the SAS.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.590
All Special Forces, in fact.
And I think I know why.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.693
If you are from Mexico
or France or Italy,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.562
you wake up in the morning,
open the curtains,

02:41.629 --> 02:43.997
it's a lovely day, think,
"I'll go to the beach."

02:44.064 --> 02:46.767
In Scotland
you open the curtains...

02:46.834 --> 02:48.402
it's damp and cold:

02:48.469 --> 02:50.604
"I'll go to the shed
and I'll invent something."

02:50.671 --> 02:52.673
That's what's going on there.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.008
I'm surprised, actually,
the English,

02:55.075 --> 02:58.078
don't just say that those
are British inventions.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.514
Ah, yes,
the Andy Murray syndrome.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.917
Let's be honest,
this does happen a lot.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.953
OK. Alexander Graham Bell,

03:06.019 --> 03:07.588
when he was working away

03:07.655 --> 03:09.523
with his Bakelite
and his wires in his shed,

03:09.590 --> 03:11.392
he was a Scottish crackpot.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.328
When he invented
the telephone,

03:14.395 --> 03:16.430
he was a British genius!

03:16.497 --> 03:19.267
Exactly the same sort of
thing happens with sport.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.369
Motor racing, Jackie Stewart.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.104
Three times Formula 1
World Champion.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.539
OK, he's British.

03:25.606 --> 03:29.277
Jim Clark. Two times
Formula 1 World Champion.

03:29.277 --> 03:32.680
British. David Coulthard...
Scottish.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.586
That's how it works!

03:38.652 --> 03:40.688
- It is, yes.
- Maybe we should explain

03:40.754 --> 03:42.690
to people in America
what's going on here.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.758
Yeah, exactly. Let me
just clear this up for you.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.794
This is how it works
on this side of the pond.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.730
This is Britain. This bit is
England, where we're from.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.565
This bit's Scotland,
where we are now.

03:51.632 --> 03:55.168
This bit's Wales, which
is next to where I live.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.070
Exactly. The rules
are very simple.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.606
If you're English

03:58.672 --> 04:01.074
and you become brilliant
or do something brilliant,

04:01.141 --> 04:02.610
you remain English.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.312
If you're Scottish or Welsh

04:04.312 --> 04:05.779
and you do
something brilliant,

04:05.846 --> 04:10.951
the English decide that
you are, in fact, British.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.554
The English really are
appalling, aren't they?!

04:13.621 --> 04:16.724
They are!

04:19.960 --> 04:22.330
I tell you what,
I love being in Scotland

04:22.330 --> 04:24.565
because everyone here
speaks their mind.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.634
There's no ambiguity.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.002
The town of Larkhall in
Scotland, their welcome sign,

04:29.069 --> 04:31.339
here we go.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.047
This is Scotland.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.215
It's not just words,
either, it's actions.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.518
Do you remember
that terrorist attack
at Glasgow Airport

04:44.585 --> 04:46.186
a couple of years ago?

04:46.253 --> 04:48.922
Somebody tried to explode...
bomb didn't go off.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.624
He ran off and he
didn't get very far

04:50.691 --> 04:53.260
because this happened.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.669
The Scottish way.
That is the Scottish way.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.606
And um...

05:05.673 --> 05:09.209
Interestingly, there have
been no terrorist attacks
in Scotland since.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.479
Just thinking about that
for a second.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.113
When he kicked him,
he must have broken his foot

05:13.180 --> 05:14.615
on the other guy's pelvis.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.784
- Yeah.
- Which means the guy's plums

05:16.850 --> 05:19.987
were in the middle
of the impact.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.391
When that terrorist
woke up that morning,

05:23.424 --> 05:24.825
he must've thought, "Right,

05:24.892 --> 05:26.994
"The worst thing
that'll happen to me today

05:27.060 --> 05:28.161
is I'm gonna blow up."

05:28.228 --> 05:29.730
It wasn't, though, was it?

05:29.797 --> 05:32.833
Cos the only thing to explode
was his knackers.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.403
- Can we get on with the show?
- Yes. Good idea.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.271
Because in tonight's
car programme...

05:38.406 --> 05:40.774
I urinate on an engine...

05:42.576 --> 05:44.712
Richard wears an anorak...

05:45.613 --> 05:48.482
and James takes drugs.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.753
But first, I want
to talk about Fiat.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.088
They're mostly known
these days for the 500,

05:55.155 --> 05:56.990
which is a small
retro hatchback.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.992
But after an absence
of more than a decade,

05:59.059 --> 06:01.294
they are back in
the sports car game.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.030
So I went down
to the Eboladrome

06:03.096 --> 06:04.998
to check out what
they've come up with.

06:18.679 --> 06:22.450
Here it is.
And as with the 500,

06:22.483 --> 06:23.817
you can tell straightaway

06:23.884 --> 06:27.455
that Fiat are playing
the nostalgia card

06:27.488 --> 06:31.459
because this car is
called the 124 Spider,

06:31.459 --> 06:36.730
in honour of their rear-wheel
drive roadster from the '70s.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.799
Under the skin, though,

06:38.866 --> 06:44.171
the 124 is based on the
thoroughly modern Mazda MX-5.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.608
Fiat supply some important
things like the engine

06:47.675 --> 06:49.309
and the body,

06:49.376 --> 06:50.778
but both cars are built

06:50.844 --> 06:53.013
on the same production
line in Japan.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.518
On the surface,
that is no bad thing.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.487
You're gonna sleep
a lot better at night

06:59.487 --> 07:01.154
knowing that your Italian car

07:01.221 --> 07:04.057
was actually put together
by the Japanese.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.860
However, it does
raise a question.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.797
Is that a sports car
in its own right,

07:09.863 --> 07:13.867
or just a Mazda with
a different badge on?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.769
Well, before we find out,

07:15.836 --> 07:18.038
let's look a bit more
closely at the badge.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.108
Because you'll notice
it says Abarth.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.613
Abarth are Fiat's
go- to people

07:25.679 --> 07:29.182
when they want
to light a fire
under one of their cars.

07:29.249 --> 07:33.353
Not light an actual fire, but
give what's already there

07:33.420 --> 07:37.024
some extra zest
and zing and fire.

07:39.860 --> 07:44.397
For starters, Abarth
has tuned the 1.4 litre
turbo- charged engine,

07:44.532 --> 07:49.670
so that this, the hottest
124, is faster than any MX- 5.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.708
0- 60 takes 6.8 seconds.

07:56.877 --> 08:02.082
And the top speed is 145mph.

08:02.149 --> 08:06.554
But in a car like this
that feels like 145 million.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.758
Certainly bundles for me.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.196
And it's not just performance
where the 124 has the edge

08:16.263 --> 08:19.867
over its Japanese
half- brother.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.835
I have to admit, and this
comes from someone

08:21.902 --> 08:25.205
who struggles
to find fault with the MX- 5,

08:25.272 --> 08:28.008
the 124 does sound better.

08:30.711 --> 08:35.282
Abarth have given it
something called the Record
Monza exhaust system.

08:35.348 --> 08:40.453
What it does is make a small
car produce a big- car noise.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.898
It's like a cat
in a lion suit

08:50.964 --> 08:53.601
and that's exactly the sort
of panto you want.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.371
What I'm saying here is that
this car does its own thing.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.141
It has its own personality.
And that's important.

09:03.744 --> 09:07.848
But on the next point,
the 124 does take
a bit of a body blow.

09:10.684 --> 09:15.322
You see, there's a price to
pay for all this Abarth- ness.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.959
And that price is £30,000.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.630
£5,000 more
than the top MX- 5.

09:22.630 --> 09:27.467
That said, the 124 does give
you more under the skin,

09:27.534 --> 09:32.339
most notably in
the handling department.

09:32.405 --> 09:37.144
The thing is,
Abarth have given this car
a limited- slip diff...

09:37.210 --> 09:40.814
which makes sliding
something you command.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.792
The MX- 5 doesn't have that.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.561
Neither does it have
this sport button here,

09:54.662 --> 09:57.665
which relaxes
the stability control.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.733
Quite a lot.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.514
So, what we have here
is a car that's fast,

10:14.581 --> 10:17.951
sounds good and is
great fun in the corners.

10:20.353 --> 10:24.057
But there's something else
very important about the 124.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.563
I don't know that there's
really a million miles
of difference

10:30.630 --> 10:32.900
between this
and the MX- 5.

10:35.435 --> 10:39.139
But everything I do
in this car I'm doing
in an Italian sports car.

10:41.608 --> 10:45.913
And it is impossible
for that not to put you
in a good mood.

10:47.414 --> 10:51.752
It does feel so good
to be in a small,
Italian roadster again.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.755
It's about time.

10:54.822 --> 10:59.092
Everything about
this little Fiat is designed
to stir the emotions.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.929
And make you smile
like a child.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.798
Right down to
the retro black bonnet.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.167
God, I love a black bonnet!

11:07.234 --> 11:09.602
It just... Ooh!

11:09.737 --> 11:11.739
It's just...a black bonnet.

11:11.805 --> 11:15.876
Only cool cars
have black bonnets. Fact!

11:15.943 --> 11:18.511
I really like the MX- 5.

11:18.578 --> 11:22.115
But the 124 has taken those
Japanese foundations

11:22.182 --> 11:24.852
and added some
Italian showmanship.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.757
That's why I'd have it
over the Mazda.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.993
I don't just like it,
I love it.

11:39.767 --> 11:43.070
It's interesting that,
because...

11:43.136 --> 11:46.373
..as you know, I'm a sucker
for an Italian sports car.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.176
Love 'em to bits
especially the Alfa.

11:49.242 --> 11:53.046
However, I've driven an
ordinary, cooking Fiat 124

11:53.113 --> 11:56.984
and that is not as good as
an MX- 5, not even close.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.052
That's true. You'd be better
off with the MX- 5.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.789
Unless you want
the fastest MX- 5,

12:01.789 --> 12:03.256
in which case buy the Abarth.

12:03.323 --> 12:07.828
- Quite.
- Have we just done
consumer advice?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.197
A little bit. A little bit.
Moving on quickly.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.199
Yes, we will, move it on.
And we'll find out

12:12.265 --> 12:15.235
how fast the Abarth goes
round the Eboladrome.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.104
That, of course, means
handing it over to a man

12:17.170 --> 12:19.940
who thinks that beards
were invented by Lenin.

12:20.007 --> 12:23.243
Yep. It's the American.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.913
There he is,
poised and ready.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.981
And he's off.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.950
With a skitter of wheelspin

12:30.017 --> 12:31.584
and a fruity noise
from the exhaust.

12:31.651 --> 12:36.623
Straight onto
a soaking-wet Isn't Strait.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.959
What the hell...

12:39.026 --> 12:41.995
has happened in my life...

12:42.062 --> 12:44.497
that I'm over here
driving a Fiat...

12:44.564 --> 12:47.500
in the wet in England?

12:47.567 --> 12:51.071
He may not be enjoying it
but he is very good at it.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.341
As he carves the 124
through the standing water,

12:54.407 --> 12:58.711
making the best use
of its 170 horsepower.

12:58.846 --> 13:02.249
Really leaning on it as he
approaches Your Name Here.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.716
That is ballsy.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.085
Now, heavy on the brakes,

13:05.152 --> 13:08.355
swoops round this fast
left-hander,

13:08.421 --> 13:12.425
and exits with a skilful
flurry of stylish over-steer.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.161
Back onto the Isn't.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.897
Hell, I don't know
whether to drive this thing

13:16.964 --> 13:18.866
or use it for a spit-cup.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.934
Charming!

13:21.001 --> 13:22.269
Nerds will note
these conditions

13:22.335 --> 13:24.872
would be better suited
to a Barchetta.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.439
If you like this car,

13:26.506 --> 13:29.877
I bet you got a lot of fancy
cushions in your house.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.278
Yeah, cos as we know,

13:31.344 --> 13:33.313
cushions are,
of course, Communist.

13:33.380 --> 13:38.118
Right, into the tight complex
of Old Lady's House.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.453
Keeping it nice and tidy
through there.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.591
And now full power
for the lumpy, bumpy sprint

13:44.657 --> 13:46.493
down to Substation.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.996
Front hazards coming on
under hard braking.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.998
All Fiats do that
for some reason.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.366
Armful of opposite lock
into Field Of Sheep.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.304
More exuberance through
there and across the line.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.979
It was a ballsy entry into
Your Name Here, that was.

14:06.046 --> 14:11.084
Anyway...we must now
find out where it ends up
on the board.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.953
Let's have a look.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.956
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, Hammond.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.958
So you've recommended what is

14:18.025 --> 14:20.327
officially the slowest car
in the world.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.830
Well... No,
slowest car on our board.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.765
- Our board is the world.
- It is.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.935
All right. Look, it was wet.

14:27.935 --> 14:31.338
That lake's wet. Someone
once did 200mph on that.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.740
- And...
- Then they were killed,
I admit.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.042
- But...
- Quite, quite.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.343
Let's move on. It's time now

14:36.409 --> 14:38.378
for us to take a gentle cruise

14:38.445 --> 14:42.315
down the velvety smoothness
of Conversation Street.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.591
- That really hurts.
- It did!

14:51.658 --> 14:53.726
Just to be absolutely
clear with you,

14:53.793 --> 14:55.495
that really, really hurt.

14:55.562 --> 15:00.133
Yeah. It was supposed
to be a pretend bottle.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.236
- Let's move it on.
- I would like to converse
about something important.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.439
Why is it that we have
leather seats in cars?

15:06.506 --> 15:08.976
Because in reality
it's a terrible material.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.443
It's too shiny and slippery.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.046
It's too hot or it's
too cold. It's rubbish.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.315
I think it's cos we got
hung up on the idea

15:15.382 --> 15:18.418
that leather is somehow
posh on a car seat.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.886
But it didn't
use to be like that.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.354
In the old days,
the posh people sat

15:21.421 --> 15:23.490
in the back of the car
on cloth seats,

15:23.556 --> 15:25.258
and it was the chauffeur
sitting at the front--

15:25.325 --> 15:26.994
they gave him leather
because it's hard-wearing.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.296
I've got a picture here
of an old car.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.332
They didn't even extend
the roof to cover him!

15:32.399 --> 15:33.766
Another three feet
would have done it.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.335
I think that's deliberate.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.704
I think that's to remind him
that he's scum!

15:39.339 --> 15:42.009
What would you two like to
have instead of leather?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.843
There's all sorts of things
you could use.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.845
You could have
cable-knit wool.

15:45.912 --> 15:50.117
But it's nice, it's cosy.
Desperately looking around.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.020
- His jumper would make
quite a good car seat.
- Cosy.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.722
It's nylon! It is!

15:55.788 --> 15:58.358
Or pleblon. One of the two.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.228
- It's a good idea.
- It isn't a good idea!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.363
Or, how's this for an idea?

16:03.430 --> 16:05.232
Let me just throw it
out there.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.200
Why not take a cow,

16:07.267 --> 16:10.370
turn the middle of it
into burgers and steaks,

16:10.437 --> 16:13.106
and then, instead
of throwing the skin away,

16:13.173 --> 16:15.542
use it to cover
the seats of your car?

16:15.608 --> 16:18.811
Because it's a terrible
material and it doesn't work.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.213
That's only because you two

16:20.280 --> 16:22.049
have decided
to be vegetarians.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.483
Well, no, hang on...

16:23.550 --> 16:26.153
They have.
They actually have.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.121
They woke up together
one morning and went,

16:28.188 --> 16:29.422
"Let's not eat meat
any more."

16:29.489 --> 16:32.625
We didn't wake up
together one morning.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.527
- Get clear on that.
- It's a fine definition.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.630
Mysteriously arrived at
the same conclusion

16:37.697 --> 16:38.931
pretty much the same day.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.433
Anyway,
we still eat chicken.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.302
Yep. Chicken is a vegetable.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.571
- It isn't.
- It is.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.307
Scientifically,
chicken is a vegetable.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.110
If you cut a chicken's head
off it still runs around.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.611
There you go.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.446
Thereby proving
it's not a sentient being,

16:53.513 --> 16:55.182
it's a higher-order vegetable.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.583
Scientifically.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.585
OK, we'll make the seats
of your cars

16:58.651 --> 17:01.088
out of chicken skins.
Actually, that's not
a bad idea.

17:01.154 --> 17:05.592
Wouldn't a chicken-skin seat
look like a giant scrotum?

17:05.658 --> 17:08.295
Yes, and that's your fault
for not eating meat.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.397
So now let's move on,
shall we?

17:10.463 --> 17:13.600
I've got something.
Back in the 1920s, OK,

17:13.666 --> 17:15.302
a Scottish company
made a car

17:15.368 --> 17:17.537
which they said was for women.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.140
Got a picture of it here.
It's called the Galloway.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.776
What about that car
makes it for women?

17:23.843 --> 17:27.347
Well, they said it had
a smaller-than-usual
steering wheel

17:27.414 --> 17:30.450
- and a more reliable engine.
- Oh, yeah, of course,

17:30.517 --> 17:32.552
because men don't want
a reliable engine, do they?

17:32.619 --> 17:34.287
- It's only women!
- I hate reliable engines.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.922
Also, you can drive it
standing up,

17:35.988 --> 17:38.125
which is what women did
in the 1920s.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.459
This sort of thing
is still going on today

17:39.526 --> 17:40.960
because I've got
news of one here.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.395
A car that's been launched

17:42.462 --> 17:45.332
called the Seat Mii
Cosmopolitan.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.234
We have a picture of it.
There you go.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.137
- How do you spell Mii?
- M-I-I.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.240
- It's Mii-iii.
- It is Mii-iii.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.476
"I've got a Mii-iii."

17:56.543 --> 17:58.378
It's been done
in collaboration

17:58.445 --> 17:59.646
with Cosmopolitan magazine.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.314
"It's aimed at
Cosmo Girl," it says.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.615
And, are you ready?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.451
"The headlights have
an eyeliner shape."

18:04.517 --> 18:07.887
- No, they don't.
- "It's easy to park."

18:07.954 --> 18:09.422
Oh, yeah, cos...

18:09.489 --> 18:11.624
I much prefer a car
that's hard to park

18:11.691 --> 18:13.793
because I'm a man.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.428
Can we get something
clear here? OK?

18:15.495 --> 18:18.431
This gender-splitting
of cars is ridiculous.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.600
It's like saying
a woman's airline seat

18:20.667 --> 18:23.836
or a woman's matches
or a woman's anything.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.573
"Can I buy a box
of women's pencils, please?"

18:26.639 --> 18:30.410
Exactly. The only things
I can think of that
can be split by gender

18:30.477 --> 18:34.247
- are bicycles,
because of the crossbar.
- Yeah.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.317
- And underwear.
- Sometimes, yeah.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.954
Overshare?

18:42.021 --> 18:43.390
I said that out...

18:47.827 --> 18:51.198
I left in a hurry.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.366
Honestly, I just
can't understand

18:53.433 --> 18:55.202
why people think
there's such a thing

18:55.202 --> 18:57.604
- as a woman's car
and a man's car.
- Ridiculous.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.239
It's not as if you drive cars

18:59.306 --> 19:01.274
with your old chap
or your magic triangle.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.410
And there's um...

19:09.749 --> 19:12.585
- Listen...
- It's a little graphic.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.122
But a few years ago,
Volvo did a concept car,

19:16.223 --> 19:17.457
and they boasted very loudly

19:17.524 --> 19:19.426
that the whole thing
had been designed

19:19.492 --> 19:21.394
entirely by women.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.496
And I've got a picture of it.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.932
It's a coupe with gull-wing
doors and a massive engine.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.267
It's what everyone would do.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.236
I would definitely
have done that. Exactly.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.437
Men and women
are exactly the same

19:30.503 --> 19:32.071
when it comes to cars.
The end.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.306
- Exactly.
- Right. Now...

19:33.373 --> 19:34.841
You know Tesla?

19:34.907 --> 19:37.910
Tesla believes it's
pioneering the electric car.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.547
But that ain't so.
There was a Scottish
company back in the '60s

19:40.613 --> 19:42.282
which made an electric car.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.418
- I've got
a picture of it here.
Oh, God!

19:45.485 --> 19:46.986
It's called The Scamp.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.922
It had a top speed of 35mph,

19:49.989 --> 19:51.624
a range of 20 miles.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.093
And I want to make it
absolutely plain,

19:54.160 --> 19:55.995
that's Scottish, not British.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.666
It is, yes!
Very definitely!

19:59.732 --> 20:01.868
That...
that is Scottish.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.272
We can end the conversation.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.807
Now, all over the world,

20:07.874 --> 20:11.010
people, by and large,
buy very boring cars.

20:11.077 --> 20:14.314
I met a man yesterday
who'd just spent £8,000

20:14.381 --> 20:15.548
on a five-year-old
Ford Focus.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.650
I thought,
"Why did you do that?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.319
If you've got £8,000 to spend,

20:19.386 --> 20:21.621
why didn't you buy
a used Maserati?"

20:21.688 --> 20:23.756
I think it's because
people believe

20:23.823 --> 20:27.727
if you buy the used, exotic
Italian car for £8,000

20:27.794 --> 20:29.496
it's going to break down
all the time.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.798
Yes, but will it? To find out,

20:31.864 --> 20:34.701
we actually put
our own money on the line,

20:34.767 --> 20:38.705
and we each went out
and bought a second- hand
Maserati.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.741
Yes, and then we decided
that cars this glamorous

20:41.808 --> 20:45.445
and this exciting couldn't
possibly be tested in Britain.

20:45.512 --> 20:50.383
So we decided to meet up
in continental Europe.

20:56.656 --> 21:01.561
This is the race track
we selected.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.331
It's just 60 miles
from Calais,

21:04.331 --> 21:06.533
and I arrived
bright and early.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.943
This...is a
Maserati Biturbo.

21:17.009 --> 21:21.681
First car in the world to be
fitted with two turbo chargers.

21:21.748 --> 21:25.452
And this particular example
is the sought-after S model.

21:25.518 --> 21:29.356
And it's only done
24,000 miles.

21:29.356 --> 21:35.362
And yet despite that,
all I paid for it was £7,950.

21:35.428 --> 21:39.799
So you get all this glamour,
all this power,

21:39.866 --> 21:43.403
all that badge for less
than you'd pay in the UK

21:43.470 --> 21:45.972
for a six-year-old
Toyota "Pious".

21:50.710 --> 21:54.647
Why has Richard Hammond
arrived in a Ford Cortina?

21:54.714 --> 21:59.752
Wait. It isn't a Ford Cortina,
it's another Biturbo!

21:59.819 --> 22:02.989
- No, this is the 430.
- It isn't!

22:03.055 --> 22:04.391
- It is!
- Biturbo.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.625
This isn't a Biturbo.

22:05.692 --> 22:06.926
- It is!
- That's a Biturbo.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.260
Hammond.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.762
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.632
But the Ghibli, the Racing,

22:12.699 --> 22:15.635
the Karif, the Shamal,
the 222 and the 430,

22:15.702 --> 22:18.405
they were all the same car.
They haven't got any money.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.440
They just changed the name
badge on the back.

22:20.507 --> 22:21.941
These are the same car.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.444
Yours is very ugly,
but it's the same car.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.778
I dispute that.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.680
This is not ugly,
this is elegant.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.449
- This is Italian style.
- It isn't!

22:29.516 --> 22:32.284
That is a fabulous-looking
car. Let's look at this.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.687
What have you got?
It's a bit gaudy, mate.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.789
You wanna hear
this baby fire up.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.227
Get out! Save yourself!

22:41.293 --> 22:44.263
Yes!

22:44.330 --> 22:45.532
Feel the power of that!

22:45.598 --> 22:47.534
Have you seen all this--

22:47.600 --> 22:49.536
there's no other word
for it-- oil?

22:49.602 --> 22:51.103
Yeah, that...

22:51.170 --> 22:52.204
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.573
Happily,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.274
before any more
could flood out,

22:55.341 --> 22:56.943
James arrived.

22:59.879 --> 23:04.784
Have you ever seen a more
ungainly-looking machine?

23:04.851 --> 23:06.786
What's the matter?
Is your door broken?

23:06.853 --> 23:09.656
No, I'm broken. Can you hold
the door for me? Thank you.

23:09.722 --> 23:14.761
Behold...the Maserati
Zagato Spyder.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.063
- Biturbo, mate.
- Zagato Spyder.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.465
All Biturbos.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.467
I think this was designed

23:20.533 --> 23:21.968
when it was owned by Citroen,

23:22.034 --> 23:24.070
which was bankrupt
at the time.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.738
Then there was
some guy in America

23:25.805 --> 23:27.574
who had a bit of Maserati.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.341
And then the Italian
Government, or Fiat,

23:29.476 --> 23:31.243
they all sort of had
bits of it.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.746
They ran around going,
"We made a new car. Look."

23:33.813 --> 23:35.982
It was exactly the same,
it just had a new name.

23:36.048 --> 23:39.051
Excuse me, James.
I just want to see just...

23:39.118 --> 23:41.488
Oh, you've got
two-tone leather.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.523
But why have you got
an automatic?

23:43.590 --> 23:45.592
I've bust my arm.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.560
That's why it took
a long time to get out.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.795
Have you really
broken your arm?

23:48.861 --> 23:50.262
Which arm have you broken?

23:52.932 --> 23:55.101
It has made me murderously
bad-tempered

23:55.167 --> 23:57.737
and intolerant
of your fatuousness.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.171
Have you seriously
broken your arm?

23:59.238 --> 24:00.740
It's fractured quite badly.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.842
- Don't touch it.
- How did you break it?

24:02.909 --> 24:05.745
- I fell over.
- That's why you got
an automatic?

24:05.812 --> 24:08.180
- Yes.
- Is that roof electric?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.650
- No.
- There's a button
on the front.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.521
- Oh, right. So it is manual.
- Yes.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.756
Anyway, we must get off.
Come on, let's drive on.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.125
Can you put the roof
back up for me?

24:19.191 --> 24:21.060
No! I'm not doing that.

24:23.763 --> 24:28.200
We decided first of all
to have a drag race,

24:28.267 --> 24:32.271
between our cars and
a similarly-priced
modern car...

24:32.338 --> 24:34.541
the Suzuki "Celery".

24:39.111 --> 24:40.547
Tense moment.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.624
Sadly, however, the pit
straight was too narrow

24:51.691 --> 24:53.626
for our four cars.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.463
What are you doing?

24:57.564 --> 24:59.599
Hammond, you idiot!

25:03.836 --> 25:06.573
- You crashed into my Maserati!
- You crashed into mine!

25:06.573 --> 25:08.440
I've got nowhere to go.
There's a barrier there.

25:08.575 --> 25:11.243
There was nowhere for me
to go. I was where I was.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.814
So, for the second attempt...

25:16.783 --> 25:19.819
I volunteered to go
down the pit lane.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.690
Yes, this is genius!

25:25.658 --> 25:27.994
And that didn't work, either.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.597
Re-emerging on the track.
Hammond is there.

25:30.597 --> 25:31.898
What the hell?

25:31.964 --> 25:34.667
Oh, shit!

25:36.068 --> 25:37.604
Oh, my God!

25:37.637 --> 25:40.807
Arg!

25:40.873 --> 25:43.375
Why the hell can't we just
do a drag race properly?

25:43.442 --> 25:45.511
It can't be that difficult.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.781
After this latest accident,
we decided that,

25:48.848 --> 25:52.384
as Hammond's car had
the biggest engine...

25:52.451 --> 25:55.788
he'd represent Maserati's
honour on his own.

25:56.956 --> 26:00.226
OK, this is it.
I am the elected driver.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.631
The chosen one.
The kingpin.

26:06.498 --> 26:07.800
I like that.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.173
Massive amount
of bleeping about...

26:15.274 --> 26:18.010
But then...

26:18.077 --> 26:23.049
Finally, it spools up,
turbos whizzing away.

26:26.518 --> 26:29.221
And yes!
Absolutely creamed it!

26:31.090 --> 26:33.993
Yep, they were right
to pick me.

26:34.060 --> 26:37.930
And the car,
the 430...Maserati.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.734
Now you've established
that, as a team,

26:41.801 --> 26:44.370
our twin turbo-charged
Maseratis are faster

26:44.436 --> 26:46.706
than a 67-horsepower "Celery",

26:46.773 --> 26:49.275
let's get rid of
the little Japanese car

26:49.341 --> 26:52.745
and find out which
of our three cars

26:52.812 --> 26:55.014
is the fastest
round the track.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.949
We'll be driving Maseratis

26:57.016 --> 26:59.518
on a race track
in continental Europe.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.220
Sounds good, doesn't it?

27:01.287 --> 27:03.956
What's the matter with you?
Why do you look so miserable?

27:05.992 --> 27:07.994
I've broken my arm.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.595
If we're gonna drive
round a track,

27:09.696 --> 27:12.932
can I at least have one of
those disabled knob things?

27:12.999 --> 27:15.034
- You know.
- On the steering wheel?

27:15.101 --> 27:16.703
Yeah, like a forklift
truck has.

27:16.703 --> 27:17.904
Sounds fair enough.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.308
So, whilst our
colleague enjoyed

27:22.374 --> 27:24.744
his special breakfast,

27:24.811 --> 27:27.179
Richard and I attached
his steering knob.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.414
There you go.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.818
And then we hit the track.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.321
The roots of this car,

27:35.387 --> 27:40.026
they were planted during
the 1957 German Grand Prix.

27:40.092 --> 27:43.329
Fangio, at the wheel
of his Maserati 250F,

27:43.395 --> 27:49.902
overcame a 48-second deficit
in 22 laps to win the race.

27:49.969 --> 27:53.072
He smashed the lap record
ten times.

27:53.139 --> 27:57.376
You don't lose
a pedigree like that.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.279
Here we go. Feel the tail
kick out a little bit.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.582
Or the front go.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.785
There's the back.
On the front.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.756
Oh, God. I've got it.

28:12.925 --> 28:16.062
Flying laps in a Maserati.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.765
This is exactly
what Stirling Moss did.

28:25.571 --> 28:28.340
Not exactly.
Bits of it are.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.778
Meanwhile,
in the convertible,

28:31.844 --> 28:35.314
James was very unhappy
with his new steering knob.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.990
Oh, God,
it's the left-hander.

28:45.792 --> 28:48.928
Bend the knob.

28:48.995 --> 28:51.330
What is the matter
with those two?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.103
We're OK.
We're in good shape.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.440
No, we're not!

29:01.507 --> 29:03.475
Despite my
lucky-dip handling,

29:03.542 --> 29:05.878
I did eventually
catch Hammond.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.050
Take him!
Take him on the inside!

29:11.117 --> 29:12.819
Yes!

29:13.719 --> 29:15.121
Yes!

29:17.323 --> 29:18.557
No!

29:21.460 --> 29:22.929
Arg!

29:24.831 --> 29:26.899
No, I... Oh, God, strewth.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.837
He's going surely now!

29:30.837 --> 29:32.304
Jesus!

29:35.707 --> 29:39.478
It just has too many
horsepowers here. Come on!

29:41.948 --> 29:43.215
Oh, shit.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.521
Mr Clarkson
is indisposed briefly.

29:49.588 --> 29:53.559
And moments later,
so was Mr Hammond.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.361
No, no, no!

29:56.628 --> 29:58.597
Come on!

29:58.664 --> 30:03.235
So, having learned
absolutely nothing at all...

30:03.302 --> 30:06.138
we decided to abandon
the race track

30:06.205 --> 30:08.740
and embark on
a 700-mile cruise

30:08.807 --> 30:11.510
to the south of France.

30:11.577 --> 30:15.047
James was very pleased
with this plan.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.149
This is more like it,
isn't it?

30:17.216 --> 30:18.817
Not mucking around
on a race track,

30:18.885 --> 30:21.020
which is always
a bad idea in old cars.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.022
We're going on
a proper road trip

30:23.089 --> 30:24.857
to a lovely part of the world

30:24.924 --> 30:28.660
in very, very evocative,
exotic cars--

30:28.727 --> 30:30.129
Maserati!

30:31.931 --> 30:34.700
In the 1970s, Maserati
was naming all its cars

30:34.766 --> 30:38.137
after...exotic-sounding
warm winds:

30:38.204 --> 30:41.173
Mistral, Khamsin, Bora.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.945
When I was a kid
growing up in Doncaster,

30:46.012 --> 30:47.146
I just thought,

30:47.213 --> 30:49.315
"I've no idea
what a Mistral is

30:49.381 --> 30:50.582
but I want one!"

30:52.251 --> 30:55.154
Maserati. South of France.

30:55.221 --> 31:00.526
It just sounds right.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.394
However, fairly soon,

31:02.461 --> 31:05.597
reality began to stick
its unwelcome nose

31:05.664 --> 31:07.333
into the equation.

31:07.399 --> 31:11.938
You get no heat in here
and I can't de-mist at all.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.940
The brakes.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.641
It brakes
one wheel very well.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.311
But only one wheel at a time.
And you never know which one.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.517
James, are my lights
dazzling you?

31:25.584 --> 31:30.456
- Yeah, a bit.
- Because they seem
to be on main beam,

31:30.522 --> 31:31.958
but I can't dip them.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.426
If I put my
headlights on full beam,

31:34.493 --> 31:36.228
nobody coming the other
way flashes at me.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.734
You hear that rattling?

31:42.801 --> 31:44.603
That's the steering wheel.

31:47.473 --> 31:48.975
On top of
the mechanical issues,

31:48.975 --> 31:50.309
there was the problem

31:50.376 --> 31:52.111
of James tackling
the toll booths

31:52.178 --> 31:54.713
in his right-hand-drive car.

32:05.391 --> 32:08.260
Ahh! Urgh!

32:08.327 --> 32:10.196
We've got 700 miles to go.

32:10.262 --> 32:14.000
It's going to take us
for ever at this speed.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.403
And then, to cap it all...

32:17.469 --> 32:21.473
Jeremy, there are sparks
coming from under your car.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.011
I think you probably
need to stop.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.581
- Oh, look.
- Something's on fire.

32:29.648 --> 32:32.351
- Fire!
- Right. Might have
to piss on it.

32:32.418 --> 32:35.121
- Oh, no!
- Go round there!

32:35.187 --> 32:40.259
He's going to claim to be
an emergency service now.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.161
Annoyingly,
our road trip

32:42.228 --> 32:45.497
wasn't proving to be as
stylish as we'd hoped.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.035
So, at the next petrol stop,

32:49.068 --> 32:51.103
with James failing
to appreciate

32:51.170 --> 32:52.571
a present
we'd bought for him...

32:52.638 --> 32:54.740
You used to have
a good sense of humour.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.376
I do have a good
sense of humour when
you're being funny.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.645
- Which you are sometimes.
- ...I suggested a new idea.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.647
Listen, listen.
I've had a thought.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.615
South of France
is a long way away.

33:03.682 --> 33:07.419
So why don't we go to
the north of France instead?

33:07.486 --> 33:09.521
- Yes!
- That is a good idea.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.923
And there's much more
to see and do in the north

33:12.058 --> 33:14.326
than there is
in the south of France.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.762
What is there to see and do
in the north of France?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.765
Well, there's
the immigrant camp in Calais.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.469
There's that square where
they set fire to a woman.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.204
Yes.

33:32.378 --> 33:35.114
There'll be other stuff.
There will be other stuff.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.219
OK. Thank you very much.

33:41.820 --> 33:45.124
Thank you so much. Thank you.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.792
We'll pick that up later on,

33:46.858 --> 33:50.796
but now it's time to play
Celebrity Brain Crash!

33:59.138 --> 34:01.940
- Yeah, it's still terrible.
- Awful!

34:02.108 --> 34:05.644
OK, now what can we say
about our guest this week?

34:05.711 --> 34:10.116
He's Scottish, but he won
a gold medal at the Olympics.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.750
So of course he's British.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.254
He started out in cycling,

34:15.321 --> 34:17.423
then very wisely
took up motor racing.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.725
He actually competed
at Le Mans.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.360
But today he's in a boat.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.729
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sir Chris Hoy!

34:25.631 --> 34:27.299
There he is!

34:28.267 --> 34:30.302
There he is.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.138
He's gonna be all right.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.473
He's rowing it
the wrong way round.

34:34.540 --> 34:38.144
The great thing is, everyone,
the great thing is...

34:38.144 --> 34:44.383
that Loch Ness
is a peaceful, inland lake
with no hazards at all.

34:44.450 --> 34:48.187
We may finally get
a guest to the studio.

34:48.254 --> 34:50.356
Yeah, that would be great.
Get him in unharmed.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.458
- Come on, Sir Hoy!
- Come on.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.760
- Come on, you can do it!
- Oh, my...

35:04.470 --> 35:07.273
What happened?
How...? What...?

35:08.240 --> 35:10.942
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:11.009 --> 35:15.581
you've just applauded
the tragic death of Sir Hoy.

35:15.647 --> 35:16.748
Um...

35:16.815 --> 35:20.619
No idea. I think
he must have hit a mine.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.754
And there was a terrific
explosion,

35:22.821 --> 35:23.789
you may have seen it.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.291
And he's now...

35:25.357 --> 35:26.592
Well, he's gone, hasn't he?

35:28.360 --> 35:31.029
Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

35:31.096 --> 35:33.064
Well, James, he's exploded

35:33.199 --> 35:35.701
and been reduced
to chops and offal.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.370
So that is a no.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.372
It's OK.
I've got a backup plan.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.941
You know voice activation
systems in cars?

35:43.008 --> 35:44.310
They don't really work,

35:44.376 --> 35:46.445
particularly they don't
work in Scotland.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.980
As we shall now demonstrate
with a short clip

35:49.047 --> 35:54.420
of a man trying to pair his
telephone with his Vauxhall.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.690
Pair.
You can say "pair".

35:58.757 --> 36:04.029
Select device. For
feedback, help or cancel...

36:04.095 --> 36:06.131
Pair.

36:06.232 --> 36:07.899
You can say "pair".

36:07.966 --> 36:10.001
I just said pair!

36:10.068 --> 36:12.103
...or cancel.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.240
Pair!

36:14.273 --> 36:17.243
You can say "pair".
Select device.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.246
For feedback,
help or cancel...

36:20.312 --> 36:23.515
Pa-a-a-ir.

36:24.750 --> 36:25.851
Pardon.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.389
What I really love
about this guy

36:30.456 --> 36:33.625
is how long
he perseveres for.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.793
Watch this.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.896
Pa-a-a-a-ir.

36:37.963 --> 36:40.266
Do you want to add
or delete a device?

36:40.299 --> 36:43.101
- Yes! Add a device.
- Pardon?

36:43.168 --> 36:45.136
Add a device.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.839
Using the pair function
and the external device...

36:47.906 --> 36:49.908
Yah!

36:55.080 --> 36:57.883
He was brilliant. Anyway...

36:57.949 --> 37:00.286
That is the problem.
That is the problem,

37:00.352 --> 37:03.622
but, Hammond,
I have a solution. OK?

37:03.689 --> 37:05.924
No, don't scoff.
Don't scoff.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.560
This is a system
that is cheap,

37:08.627 --> 37:10.596
works anywhere in the world,

37:10.662 --> 37:12.531
and you can fit it to any car,

37:12.598 --> 37:14.766
no matter how old it is.

37:14.833 --> 37:18.937
Let me show you
how it works, OK? Step in.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.139
Ready? Voice activation.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.309
Engage wipers.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.347
It's just a man!

37:28.414 --> 37:29.915
It's Gavril from Bulgaria.

37:29.981 --> 37:33.319
He can do anything.
Right, select drive.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.389
There you go. Call Bell-end.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.727
Now, he picks up the phone,
he does all the dialling.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.829
My hands are on the wheel,
I'm safe.

37:43.895 --> 37:46.565
He holds it next to my ear
so it's hands-free.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.334
Who's Bell-end?

37:52.338 --> 37:54.373
- What?
- I don't want to talk to you.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.775
End call!

37:56.842 --> 37:58.944
All right, then.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.046
Punch driver.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.014
Punch... It doesn't work.

38:03.081 --> 38:05.851
He won't respond to you,
only me. That's the genius.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.219
And it gets better.
Get out, OK.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.021
He locks the doors.

38:10.088 --> 38:12.691
And then he opens them
when I get back

38:12.758 --> 38:14.726
so I don't have to have
any keys with me,

38:14.793 --> 38:17.696
which would spoil the line
of my jean trouser.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.632
Let me just re-cap this, OK.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.934
So in Whitby you turned
a Romanian man

38:23.001 --> 38:24.903
- into a self-driving car.
- Yes, I did.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.005
You turned me
into a parking sensor.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.941
And now you've turned
a Bulgarian man into
a voice-control system.

38:30.008 --> 38:33.612
- Yes.
- There's a theme
establishing itself here,

38:33.679 --> 38:37.416
with your inventions, and
it is that you're a moron.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.552
A-ha. OK. Watch this.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.821
You know, in a modern
BMW 7 Series,

38:42.888 --> 38:44.990
you have back seats
that massage you

38:45.056 --> 38:47.459
- as you drive along, yeah?
- Yes.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.830
What I've done in here...
is just genius.

38:51.897 --> 38:55.667
I have scooped out the middle
of that back seat, OK?

38:55.734 --> 38:57.869
And then you can fit it
with a Dwan Fen.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.838
- What's a Dwan Fen?
- She's here.

38:59.905 --> 39:03.108
She's from Thailand.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.712
I don't know why people
are laughing at this.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.848
She now blends perfectly
with the seat, OK?

39:09.915 --> 39:11.950
She is the seat.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.052
So I step in...like so.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.691
And then...I get a massage
as I drive along.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.593
Ooh!

39:21.660 --> 39:25.296
James, James...he's sitting
on a Thai woman now.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.666
I know. Come back over here,
and we'll move it on.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.735
We'll go back to
the Maserati film.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.437
Now, so far
we have established

39:31.470 --> 39:33.071
that I've broken my arm,

39:33.138 --> 39:36.442
but that the cars are working
really rather well.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.043
Yes! And we rejoin the action

39:38.109 --> 39:39.978
after a night in a town
called Deauville,

39:40.045 --> 39:43.214
where Jeremy had, for reasons
known only to himself,

39:43.281 --> 39:45.016
decided to re-enact

39:45.083 --> 39:50.456
the famous VW Golf
advert from the '80s.

39:50.489 --> 39:54.325
This is the man
who put a million on black

39:54.460 --> 39:55.994
and it came up red.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.967
This is the man
who married a sex kitten,

40:02.033 --> 40:04.970
just as she turned
into a cat.

40:07.038 --> 40:10.509
This is the man
who moved into gold,

40:10.576 --> 40:13.178
just as the clever money
moved out.

40:17.949 --> 40:23.522
This is the man
who drives a Maserati.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.501
Start, you vicious bastard!

40:35.567 --> 40:40.271
Of course, being a Maserati,
it did eventually begin.

40:40.338 --> 40:44.976
So we then fitted James's
wheel with a new knob...

40:45.043 --> 40:47.846
and decided to go
and play on the beach.

40:56.855 --> 40:57.989
Ha-ha!

41:08.233 --> 41:09.735
You really would have
trouble doing this

41:09.801 --> 41:11.837
on a beach
in the south of France

41:11.903 --> 41:14.773
because the whole thing
would be covered

41:14.840 --> 41:18.544
in people turning their
plastic surgery brown.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.747
Ow-ow-ow-ow, ow-ow-ow-ow,
ow-ow-ow-ow-ow.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.051
In the sea!

41:26.117 --> 41:28.119
Whoa!

41:30.656 --> 41:33.024
You can take a Maserati
in the sea...

41:34.693 --> 41:37.896
because the rust-proofing
is so good.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.932
After that, we enjoyed
a picturesque walk

41:40.999 --> 41:43.034
and a philosophical debate.

41:43.101 --> 41:46.071
Is there anything
on earth which is worse

41:46.137 --> 41:49.074
than having another man
put sun cream on your back?

41:49.140 --> 41:50.576
I've never
experienced that.

41:50.642 --> 41:53.444
And then
we played some sport.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.180
Penalty shoot-out

41:55.246 --> 41:58.116
in Maseratis on a beach
in northern France.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.261
With our ball gone,

42:10.328 --> 42:12.163
we continued on
our tour of Normandy,

42:12.230 --> 42:17.235
with our badly-built
colleague moaning constantly.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.306
Has he been swapped
for an old lady?

42:21.372 --> 42:23.609
He's always
been an old lady.

42:23.675 --> 42:25.744
He was born an old lady!

42:25.811 --> 42:28.013
"Congratulations, Mrs May.
It's an old lady!"

42:31.449 --> 42:36.021
As darkness fell, we reached
the ancient town of Honfleur,

42:36.087 --> 42:38.056
where we decided
to spend the night.

42:38.123 --> 42:40.759
Unfortunately,
to reach our hotel,

42:40.826 --> 42:42.894
we had to navigate
through a maze

42:42.961 --> 42:45.631
of tiny, medieval streets.

42:48.834 --> 42:51.469
Pardon. Sorry.

42:51.536 --> 42:54.640
This is narrow.
Isn't it narrow?

42:57.308 --> 42:58.910
No.

43:02.648 --> 43:06.017
How did people manage in
this town in the olden days

43:06.084 --> 43:08.654
when nobody had
power steering?

43:09.688 --> 43:10.922
Oh, no.

43:12.457 --> 43:14.660
I do that how?

43:17.896 --> 43:20.098
Oh, my God.

43:21.299 --> 43:23.068
I'm totally stuck.

43:26.738 --> 43:29.207
Ow, ow, ow, ow. Cobbles.

43:33.845 --> 43:35.981
God almighty.

43:37.716 --> 43:39.751
I'm not sure that's possible.

43:48.259 --> 43:50.595
Oh, for... Is that...?

43:50.696 --> 43:52.397
You're in the way.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.700
It's a one-way street my way.

43:54.766 --> 43:56.001
It's a one-way street, yes.

43:56.067 --> 43:58.236
That's why me
and the other cars

43:58.303 --> 44:00.105
are all coming this way.

44:00.171 --> 44:03.408
Please don't make me back up
with this steering.

44:03.474 --> 44:06.444
Come on, it's a workout.

44:06.511 --> 44:08.246
Hammond,
I am gonna kill you.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.849
Moment, s'il vous plaît.

44:12.450 --> 44:14.452
Mon ami...

44:14.519 --> 44:18.489
Il a conduit-ay son voiture

44:18.556 --> 44:19.858
comme la gorilla.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.732
Vous devrez...le jambon

44:26.798 --> 44:28.900
prenez la rue à gauche

44:28.967 --> 44:33.338
et nous sommes
les champignons!

44:33.404 --> 44:37.242
With Jeremy out of the way,
I could move on.

44:37.308 --> 44:39.144
But then...

44:39.210 --> 44:42.347
Hammond, is that
you with yellow lights
coming up here?

44:42.413 --> 44:45.383
- Oh, my God.
- That's a bit of bad luck.

44:45.450 --> 44:47.585
You're going to have to
reverse up there, aren't you?

44:47.652 --> 44:50.521
I can't back up because
it's preposterously narrow

44:50.588 --> 44:53.291
and I can't swivel my head
round to look behind me.

44:53.358 --> 44:54.425
So now what?

44:54.492 --> 44:55.961
Well, I'm going the right way

44:56.027 --> 44:57.428
down the one-way street,

44:57.495 --> 44:59.097
so I have right of way.

44:59.164 --> 45:00.799
Urgh!

45:00.866 --> 45:03.869
Sorry, Hammond, you'll
have to direct me a bit.

45:03.935 --> 45:07.072
- Right a bit.
- My right or your right?

45:07.138 --> 45:08.606
Well, my right.
Which is your left

45:08.673 --> 45:11.009
but you're steering
in reverse.

45:11.076 --> 45:12.778
Hold it there
and I'll go left.

45:12.811 --> 45:14.179
Your left or my left?

45:14.245 --> 45:16.314
Your right, my left
as I'm looking.

45:16.381 --> 45:20.786
And your right
as you're looking,
i.e. your right.

45:20.819 --> 45:22.553
I had found the hotel,

45:22.620 --> 45:25.223
but clearly my colleagues
were going to be a while.

45:25.290 --> 45:27.793
When you say my left,
do you mean my left

45:27.826 --> 45:29.494
if I'm facing
the way I'm going

45:29.560 --> 45:30.996
or facing the way I'm facing?

45:31.062 --> 45:32.463
Good point.

45:32.530 --> 45:35.666
Your left is still my right.

45:35.801 --> 45:39.537
But you're going backwards.
Just drive backwards!

45:39.604 --> 45:41.907
I'm going to the hotel now
but I'll leave this on

45:41.973 --> 45:44.642
so you can stay in tune
with what they're doing.

45:44.709 --> 45:46.677
I don't believe
I've come the wrong way

45:46.812 --> 45:48.847
down a one-way street.
I know.

45:48.914 --> 45:51.817
Are you making your
situation better or worse?

45:51.883 --> 45:54.953
Better? Worse? Better? Worse?

45:55.020 --> 45:58.824
When Richard and James
did finally join me,

45:58.824 --> 46:00.258
we reflected over dinner

46:00.325 --> 46:03.228
about our time
in the north of France.

46:03.294 --> 46:06.064
It's been just
a tremendous journey.

46:06.131 --> 46:08.699
We've had three Maseratis
out here for three days

46:08.834 --> 46:11.402
and we've only had
one minor fire.

46:11.469 --> 46:14.639
Can I just say, and I'm being
absolutely honest here,

46:14.705 --> 46:16.074
I love my Maserati.

46:16.141 --> 46:18.543
- I've totally fallen for it.
- Yes.

46:18.609 --> 46:20.645
I really like mine.

46:20.711 --> 46:22.147
No car makes a better noise.

46:22.213 --> 46:24.249
No two-litre car makes
a better noise than that.

46:24.315 --> 46:26.317
I love it more now
than when I started.

46:26.384 --> 46:28.153
I definitely
want to keep mine.

46:28.219 --> 46:31.056
I want to know what it's like
to drive with two arms.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.158
Because we all loved
our cars so much,

46:33.224 --> 46:35.660
I decided we should
end our road trip

46:35.726 --> 46:38.063
with a spicy climax.

46:38.129 --> 46:41.299
Why don't we race
back to England, OK?

46:41.366 --> 46:44.302
First thing in the morning.
Last one back there...

46:45.436 --> 46:47.138
has to sell their car.

46:47.205 --> 46:49.340
- Ooh, that's cruel.
- That's harsh.

46:49.407 --> 46:53.144
It's not entirely fair
on me, is it?

46:54.279 --> 46:55.380
Hello. Why not?

46:55.446 --> 46:57.883
You chose to come
equipped with one arm.

46:57.883 --> 46:59.284
It's your issue, not ours.

46:59.350 --> 47:02.387
So we set off from here,
all at the same time.

47:02.453 --> 47:05.991
Any route you like.
Last one...

47:06.892 --> 47:08.927
back on English soil,

47:08.994 --> 47:10.261
has to sell their car.

47:10.328 --> 47:12.063
I'm up for it. I'll risk it

47:12.130 --> 47:14.132
cos that'll make the trip
home exciting.

47:14.199 --> 47:16.034
I'll do it. Last one home...

47:23.074 --> 47:24.910
As dawn broke,

47:24.943 --> 47:26.912
we lined up
outside the hotel,

47:26.978 --> 47:28.914
ready for the off.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.815
Gentlemen, it's ten
to four in the morning.

47:30.916 --> 47:32.683
Let's do this.

47:32.750 --> 47:35.320
In three, two, one... Begin!

47:44.229 --> 47:46.031
Blast!

47:46.097 --> 47:47.532
Come on!

47:51.202 --> 47:53.304
No! No!

47:53.371 --> 47:55.540
At all costs,
I am winning this.

48:00.545 --> 48:04.482
This is typical.
Typical of Italian cars.

48:04.549 --> 48:06.952
They wait until you
really need them,

48:07.018 --> 48:09.955
and then they go wrong.

48:09.988 --> 48:11.957
"Oh, darling, darling,
I'm in labour! Quickly!"

48:12.023 --> 48:14.225
"Yes, I'm on my way
in my Maserati."

48:18.096 --> 48:20.298
Right. Up here.

48:21.499 --> 48:24.235
Some of this is familiar,
which is bad.

48:25.603 --> 48:28.639
Oh, no, not lost now.

48:28.706 --> 48:31.609
Once again,
I'd managed to coax my car

48:31.676 --> 48:33.078
into some kind of life

48:33.144 --> 48:34.879
and I was on my way.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.148
So, straight out of town.

48:38.984 --> 48:43.221
Sounding healthy.

48:43.288 --> 48:45.523
With a top speed of about 12,

48:45.590 --> 48:48.126
I was headed for
the ferry port of Le Havre.

48:48.193 --> 48:49.794
The trouble
is that logically,

48:49.860 --> 48:52.630
the others would be
doing the same thing.

48:55.033 --> 48:59.370
Car, clear your throat,
please.

49:01.672 --> 49:03.608
I'm out!

49:03.674 --> 49:05.476
Right, England, here I come.

49:08.279 --> 49:11.016
Clear your throat, car!
Clear it!

49:11.082 --> 49:12.750
Or we shall be last.

49:12.817 --> 49:15.586
And then I shall have to sell
you, and not to someone nice.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.624
You know that man who
has sex with his cars

49:19.690 --> 49:22.127
and then puts pictures of it
on the internet?

49:22.193 --> 49:23.928
I'm going to sell you to him

49:24.029 --> 49:27.398
unless you get going.
Now, come on!

49:27.465 --> 49:30.101
- Hang on a minute.
- No!

49:30.168 --> 49:32.137
No, no, no, no!

49:37.075 --> 49:38.309
Big road. Yes!

49:41.046 --> 49:42.380
James, meanwhile,

49:42.447 --> 49:44.149
was dawdling along
at the back.

49:44.215 --> 49:48.819
Yet he seemed strangely
unconcerned about this.

49:48.886 --> 49:51.756
On the face of it, viewers,
this isn't much of a race,

49:51.822 --> 49:54.225
because I've got the slowest
car, we know that.

49:54.292 --> 49:56.461
I only have the use
of one arm

49:56.527 --> 49:57.762
and I'm steering

49:57.828 --> 50:01.099
with a squeaky frog
bolted to the wheel.

50:01.166 --> 50:03.768
However,
it's not that simple.

50:03.834 --> 50:06.804
In fact,

50:06.871 --> 50:09.006
I believe I will be first.

50:09.074 --> 50:12.177
Because he who is last
shall be first.

50:12.243 --> 50:14.345
As we know.

50:17.815 --> 50:19.850
Coming up now
to the motorway.

50:23.821 --> 50:25.756
Come on, car. Please!

50:29.494 --> 50:31.529
It's made it
up the slip road.

50:31.596 --> 50:34.632
Have you ever known
a car with more spirit

50:34.699 --> 50:37.402
than this magnificent
Maserati?

50:37.468 --> 50:41.206
However, the gradient
on the slip road was nothing

50:41.272 --> 50:43.341
compared to what lay ahead.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.281
Oh, my giddy aunt.

50:53.984 --> 50:56.287
Port, where is it?

50:56.354 --> 50:58.623
If I get there first, I've
got to wait for the ferry.

50:58.689 --> 51:00.791
They could catch up, but
I'll be ahead in the queue.

51:00.858 --> 51:03.928
Whoever gets on the boat
first gets off the boat first,

51:03.994 --> 51:05.263
and you can't change that.

51:05.330 --> 51:07.798
First on the boat
is first off the boat.

51:07.865 --> 51:08.833
They win.

51:18.976 --> 51:20.345
Right, calm, Jeremy, calm.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.380
You're on a motorway.

51:22.447 --> 51:24.215
On an enormous bridge,

51:24.282 --> 51:26.151
surrounded by many
heavy lorries.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.389
Oh, no.

51:31.456 --> 51:33.824
I can hear
the exhaust spluttering.

51:33.891 --> 51:37.362
Smoke. A lot of smoke now.

51:39.964 --> 51:43.168
Please! Please work!

51:44.735 --> 51:48.173
Mercifully, I reach
the top of the bridge.

51:48.173 --> 51:50.708
But then...

51:54.078 --> 51:55.380
It's dead.

51:55.446 --> 51:58.316
Shit, I've lost braking.
I have lost braking.

51:58.383 --> 52:01.386
Bloody hell. Handbrake
not working, either.

52:01.452 --> 52:03.921
I've lost all brakes.

52:03.988 --> 52:06.224
There was only
one thing for it.

52:10.895 --> 52:12.430
I have no brakes!

52:12.497 --> 52:13.931
You've just hit our car!

52:13.998 --> 52:15.233
I haven't got any brakes!

52:15.300 --> 52:16.867
They're not pleased

52:16.934 --> 52:19.637
about being used as a brake.

52:19.704 --> 52:21.071
This is totally illegal,
by the way,

52:21.206 --> 52:22.207
on a French motorway.

52:22.207 --> 52:24.275
Right, so I've no brakes

52:24.342 --> 52:25.710
and no engine.

52:31.316 --> 52:33.451
Think, Jeremy, think.

52:36.020 --> 52:38.656
Port. Yes, hello.

52:38.723 --> 52:41.125
Unaware of Jeremy's problems,

52:41.226 --> 52:43.528
I was keeping
the hammer down.

52:45.330 --> 52:46.797
Holiday-makers!

52:46.864 --> 52:49.667
I hate holiday-makers!

52:52.102 --> 52:54.405
Trucks.

52:54.472 --> 52:57.608
I'm going to get caught up
with all the trucks.

52:57.675 --> 53:00.845
Meanwhile, back in the land
of Captain Cryptic...

53:06.617 --> 53:08.253
Do you know,
I'm so relaxed about this,

53:08.319 --> 53:09.587
I think, in a short while,

53:09.654 --> 53:11.889
I might stop for
a pleasant coffee

53:11.956 --> 53:14.525
and a read of the newspaper.

53:17.295 --> 53:19.330
Not got time for you, mate.
I'm sorry.

53:19.397 --> 53:21.499
Car! Car!

53:24.001 --> 53:25.970
Oh, God. Another roundabout.

53:26.036 --> 53:28.373
It's like I'm in the middle
of bloody town.

53:30.641 --> 53:32.677
I need to find my own route.

53:32.743 --> 53:34.845
There must be
sneaky ways through.

53:41.619 --> 53:43.321
This could be good.
This could be good.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.664
Down there.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.400
Oh!

53:56.734 --> 53:57.602
Dead end.

53:57.668 --> 53:59.870
Not that way. Bloody hell.

54:16.020 --> 54:19.824
My shortcut
wasn't going well.

54:23.928 --> 54:26.731
Where are they and more
importantly where am I?

54:29.867 --> 54:34.004
This was a mistake.
This is making things worse.

54:34.071 --> 54:36.073
It's just costing time.

54:36.140 --> 54:38.042
And, as it turned out,

54:38.108 --> 54:41.245
time was something
I didn't have.

54:41.346 --> 54:43.981
I am now down to one
turbo charger,

54:44.048 --> 54:45.483
but I'm back in the race.

54:49.354 --> 54:55.159
Yes, I'm at the wheel of
a Renault DCI 120 tow truck.

54:55.225 --> 54:56.727
And what's more, I've decided

54:56.794 --> 54:59.497
to head for the port
as the crow flies.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.635
Oh, yes!

55:09.106 --> 55:11.376
Oh, God, no!

55:13.511 --> 55:15.713
This looks good.

55:17.382 --> 55:19.049
Yes. Ferry terminal.

55:20.184 --> 55:21.586
This is all correct.

55:26.190 --> 55:27.392
That is Jeremy!

55:27.425 --> 55:28.459
There's Hammond!

55:28.526 --> 55:30.194
What is he doing?

55:30.260 --> 55:32.430
Kill him!

55:34.399 --> 55:36.401
I have to win. I have to win.

55:37.902 --> 55:40.971
A roundabout.
Oh, bloody hell. Really?

55:44.809 --> 55:48.212
The problem was that the port
of Le Havre is so vast

55:48.278 --> 55:51.716
and so complex,
it was very easy to get lost.

55:51.782 --> 55:54.885
This was still anyone's race.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.492
Where is Hammond?
Where is May?

56:01.559 --> 56:02.827
Where is the boat?

56:04.562 --> 56:06.731
Come on, come on, come on.

56:17.908 --> 56:20.144
This is wrong. This is wrong.

56:27.752 --> 56:29.086
It's got to be down here.

56:29.153 --> 56:31.088
Yes!

56:33.758 --> 56:37.595
Did I have some carpet
stuck under the throttle?

56:37.662 --> 56:40.965
Cos my DCI 120's
going like a bastard!

56:47.972 --> 56:51.175
Yes! This looks good.
This is the place.

56:55.580 --> 56:58.716
Good van. Good van.
The boat is there.

56:58.783 --> 57:02.019
There is Richard Hammond.
Is James May here?

57:03.488 --> 57:05.089
No, he is not!

57:05.155 --> 57:06.724
He is not.

57:06.791 --> 57:08.693
Yes!

57:10.661 --> 57:13.197
Ha-ha! No May?

57:17.668 --> 57:19.236
No, and there
wouldn't be,

57:19.303 --> 57:21.506
because I was in
another part of the port

57:21.572 --> 57:23.574
with my own travel plans.

57:23.641 --> 57:25.943
Last night, after the other
two had gone to bed,

57:26.010 --> 57:28.513
I arranged for
our company yacht

57:28.546 --> 57:31.616
to be waiting for me
in the harbour.

57:31.682 --> 57:33.684
And there it is!

57:39.524 --> 57:42.827
I simply drive up,
hop aboard,

57:42.893 --> 57:44.562
and then we'll be on our way.

58:11.121 --> 58:13.991
- He lived, annoyingly.
- Hold on, hold on.

58:14.058 --> 58:15.860
Hold on. Hammond.

58:15.926 --> 58:17.695
I need to ask you about this.

58:17.762 --> 58:21.265
Why did you stick
"Deshabille" on my car?

58:21.331 --> 58:24.001
Because you were disabled.

58:24.068 --> 58:28.573
Déshabillé means
undressed, you moron!

58:28.573 --> 58:30.374
Let's not get bogged down

58:30.440 --> 58:31.909
with "Ooh,
can't speak French."

58:31.976 --> 58:35.746
Let's get to the point
which is, James May,

58:35.813 --> 58:38.916
you lost and you broke
the company yacht.

58:38.983 --> 58:40.685
- You did.
- Hang on a minute.

58:40.751 --> 58:43.688
My car got closer to England
than yours did.

58:43.754 --> 58:45.455
Yes, but the other thing
it got closest to

58:45.590 --> 58:47.157
was the bottom of the sea.

58:47.224 --> 58:48.859
All of that is irrelevant

58:48.926 --> 58:50.595
because my car was the best,

58:50.661 --> 58:52.429
cos it didn't
go wrong at all.

58:52.496 --> 58:54.064
Mine was perfectly reliable.

58:54.131 --> 58:57.134
Mm-hm. Mine was as reliable
as James's arms.

58:57.201 --> 59:01.271
And the extraordinary thing
is, no-one can work out

59:01.338 --> 59:02.640
what was wrong with it.

59:02.707 --> 59:04.909
It fell off the back
of a lorry.

59:04.975 --> 59:06.877
No- one can work out
what fault it had

59:06.944 --> 59:09.714
that caused it
to be on the lorry
in the first place.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.816
And even nine months
down the line,

59:11.882 --> 59:15.886
two trained Maserati mechanics
are totally stumped.

59:15.953 --> 59:18.355
It is an unfathomable fault.

59:18.422 --> 59:20.224
Yeah, so what we can conclude

59:20.290 --> 59:23.493
from our exhaustive testing
in the north of France

59:23.628 --> 59:25.630
is that if you buy
a used Maserati,

59:25.696 --> 59:28.999
you have a 66% chance
of it working.

59:30.367 --> 59:31.636
They're not bad odds.

59:31.636 --> 59:32.903
You wouldn't say that

59:32.970 --> 59:35.272
if you were having
an eye operation.

59:35.339 --> 59:37.775
Exactly. And on that
terrible disappointment,
it's time to end.

59:37.842 --> 59:40.377
Thank you so much for
watching. Good night!
