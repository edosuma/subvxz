WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.427
<i>Previously on</i> Power...

00:10.510 --> 00:13.179
<i> I don't know how</i>
<i>I'm gonna forgive Tariq,</i>

00:13.263 --> 00:15.640
<i>or any of us for</i>
<i>what happened to Raina.</i> We'll all feel better
once this is over.
Once we get Dre.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.602
I will never feel better.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.981
You want out?
You wanna walk away clean?

00:23.064 --> 00:24.190
You gotta cut ties
with everybody

00:24.274 --> 00:25.358
who knows
who you are.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.360
I heard you have
a bar hearing coming up.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.655
John Mak's got a hard-on
for getting me disbarred.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.241
Angela, you're real radioactive
around here these days.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.200
Darryl.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.827
You want me
to bury the records?

00:35.910 --> 00:37.078
If they never match the gun,

00:37.162 --> 00:39.539
-they may not trace
any of this back to you.
-Or you.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.666
<i>I have to log in</i>
<i>as someone else</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:43.168
<i>and delete the file.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:45.170
I don't think Angela's being
straight with me

00:45.253 --> 00:46.755
about where
she was last night.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.590
<i> Keep Maria Suarez</i>
<i>away from Angela</i>

00:48.673 --> 00:50.175
<i>until I tell you otherwise.</i>

00:50.300 --> 00:51.551
Brains, tell him to stop.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.219
Please, I won't say
anything to--

00:53.303 --> 00:56.139
It's time for all of us
to move on from Ghost.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.599
You ever been to Los Angeles?

00:57.682 --> 00:59.476
We'd like to see if you
can run both coasts.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.895
So the Jimenez
agreed to it all.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.605
Territory, access to the port.

01:03.688 --> 01:04.981
<i> I'd like you to meet</i>
<i>our connect,</i>

01:05.065 --> 01:06.858
Alicia and Diego Jimenez.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.194
We're very happy to begin
this new partnership.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.489
Sending K's crew in there is
playing right into Dre's hand.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.032
We need to use the Italians.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.658
I'll give you 60K for one hit.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.619
Just grab 'em
and bring 'em to me.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.621
K says they're in position.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.337
You made a mistake coming here.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.881
I have the full protection
of the Jimenez cartel,

01:30.006 --> 01:31.466
so if you come after me again,

01:31.549 --> 01:34.010
they will kill you
and your entire family.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.208
You're at the wrong dock,
amigos.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.255
We have approval to be here.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.466
Came down from the boss.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.052
Jason cleared it
with the New York distro.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.386
Not our bosses.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.971
This port
belongs to the Jimenez.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.264
Get the fuck outta here.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.516
We don't want any problems.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.729
Mistakes happen.
That's how it goes.

Hey, Boss.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.016
I thought I would be leading
the strategy meeting.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.434
You thought?

05:10.059 --> 05:11.269
I'm handling it.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.772
Take a seat, gentlemen.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.984
Uriel Diaz,
head of the Toros Locos,

05:18.067 --> 05:19.527
was found dead.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.779
With a gunshot wound
in his head

05:21.863 --> 05:24.949
and nails in
his hands and shoulders.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.284
It's sick to think that someone

05:26.367 --> 05:28.202
would take pleasure
in doing this.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.580
Looks like a cartel hit.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.457
Damn, they wanted
to make him hurt.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.958
I would've
made it hurt too.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.586
In addition to the bodies,
guns, and money
found at the house,

05:36.669 --> 05:38.379
86 keys
were seized during the raid.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.465
That's a huge hit
for an organization.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.092
And an incredibly stupid move
to keep it all in one place.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.844
So Diaz's connect,
whoever that is,

05:44.927 --> 05:46.637
was angry about the raid
and murked his ass.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.347
Self-cleaning oven, baby.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.016
According to NYPD,

05:50.099 --> 05:51.976
Diaz's death has
caused a power vacuum

05:52.060 --> 05:54.145
between Toros members
Arturo Magdeleno

05:54.228 --> 05:55.563
and Lorenzo Salazar.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.774
Oh, it's so hard to choose.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.650
May the best man win.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.152
We're waiting
on the ballistics,

06:01.235 --> 06:03.404
to see if we can get
a match on the gun.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.073
It's definitely a Narcos gun.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.866
Maybe it'll lead us
to the connect.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.494
Somebody knows who Diaz
was working with.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.871
Criminals gossip
like teenage girls.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.623
Someone will talk.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.128
Hello?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.797
Smells good in here. Yo, what's up, Keisha?

06:23.841 --> 06:24.884
Hey.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.890
Those the pancakes you make
with the bananas in them?

06:30.973 --> 06:32.058
Yeah, you want some?

06:32.141 --> 06:33.476
Yeah.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.438
It's really nice how much
you've been doing around here.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.649
I mean,
it's the least I could do.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.026
Can't even imagine
what Tasha's going through.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.780
This shit is like a nightmare
none of us can wake up from.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.867
I was there
when 'Riq and Raina were born.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.286
Raina had so much hair.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.497
Yeah, I remember.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.125
And then Ghost asked me
to be their godfather.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.669
I was so proud.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.632
I was supposed to protect them.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.509
Tommy.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.762
What happened?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.889
I can't get a straight answer
from Tasha.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.933
She asked me to
vouch for her and Tariq,

07:14.016 --> 07:16.602
that if anyone asked, to say
they never left the penthouse.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.397
What were they
really doing that night?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.235
Look, Keisha, it's better
that you don't know.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.779
You ain't never gotta
say nothing.

07:26.863 --> 07:27.905
I promise.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.242
I owe you.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.376
Yeah.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.086
I'mma go get Yas.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.007
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.884
Keish, have you seen Tasha?

07:48.676 --> 07:50.219
Said she was going out.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.721
Hmm.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.306
Thanks for the breakfast.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.474
Sure.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.310
Tommy, ready to roll?
K's waiting.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.312
-Yeah, let's do it.
-All right.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.232
Bye, Keisha.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.077
I thought we weren't gonna
see each other again.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.499
Does anyone else know that
Tariq knew Raymond Jones?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.043
I don't know.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.419
Find out.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.296
I've done what I can
to run damage control,

08:25.379 --> 08:27.840
but if someone else
links Tariq to this murder,

08:27.924 --> 08:29.800
we're all going down anyway.

08:31.427 --> 08:34.222
I've got one just like it.
Number's programmed in.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.681
Get back to me.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.027
What the fuck happened
with the job?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.238
Turn your volume down,
motherfucker.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.489
My boys did their part.

08:51.572 --> 08:52.823
They said Dre saw them coming

08:52.907 --> 08:54.075
like somebody warned him
or something.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.660
Took off running
like a little bitch.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.994
Your Italian boy
fucked this up.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.371
-Bullshit.
-Tommy.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.498
The real question is,
who could've warned him?

09:00.873 --> 09:02.416
I don't know.
And then what happened?

09:02.750 --> 09:05.503
My niggas say they heard
some gunfire pop off.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.922
I'm thinking the Italians
killed Dre on the spot.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.299
Then I come out and find
this shit on my windshield.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.801
I got one too.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.053
He put mine in my coat pocket
while I was wearing it.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.555
Why the fuck
didn't you shoot him?

09:15.638 --> 09:17.807
I was at Raina's grave site.
I wasn't strapped.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.935
I've seen cards like this
dropped on people
inside the joint.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.270
But I don't know who it's from.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.521
That's the Jimenez, K.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.064
Dre's saying
the Jimenez got his back.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.024
Fuck them Spanish niggas.
I ain't scared of nobody.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.278
What the fuck?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.863
Tommy, you wanna
tell me what the fuck this is?

09:32.947 --> 09:34.490
Oh, shit.
-Oh, it's Jason Micic.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.866
I move his weight.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.702
Put the fucking gun down.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.831
I thought I told you
to stop working with Ghost.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.207
Yo, what's up, J?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.251
I was just about to call you.
You know, I got your money.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.502
Shut the fuck up.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.254
You lied to me, Tommy.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.590
That LA port deal was bullshit.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.592
Two of my guys
are dead.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.385
The Jimenez took my shipment.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.429
Now you owe me $2 million.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.558
You see, the problem is that

10:00.641 --> 10:02.810
I don't know what would give me
more satisfaction.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.564
Getting my money,
or killing you.

10:06.647 --> 10:07.690
Wait, wait!

10:07.982 --> 10:09.275
We gonna make this right.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.694
We're gonna get you
that LA port,

10:11.777 --> 10:13.112
just like I promised.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.032
You're gonna kill the Jimenez?

10:17.074 --> 10:18.159
If that's what it takes.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.205
Since you can't seem to do
business without Ghost,

10:23.956 --> 10:25.708
you're gonna kill
the Jimenez together.

10:27.209 --> 10:29.378
And who the fuck is this guy?

10:30.338 --> 10:31.297
I'm an old friend.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.969
Well, old friend,
now you're in it too.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.931
You know it's a fucking suicide
mission, don't you?

10:41.015 --> 10:43.434
I will let you know
when the shipment comes in.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.613
I wanted to kill Dre,
not another connect.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.531
What the fuck
you want me to do?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.033
They was gonna kill us.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.743
We don't have access
to the Jimenez.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.203
Tommy, this ain't Lobos.

11:02.286 --> 11:03.621
Or-or Milan.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.122
We need an inside guy.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.249
Dre gonna lead us
right to the Jimenez.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.085
So we're gonna kill them,

11:09.168 --> 11:10.419
then we're gonna kill
that motherfucker.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.879
Everybody gets what they want.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.255
You hearing this?

11:13.339 --> 11:15.049
If we take the Jimenez
off the table,

11:15.132 --> 11:18.094
and Jason got our back,
then Dre becomes a clean kill.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.763
This is
a beautiful idea, K.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.889
Ghost, you down?

11:21.972 --> 11:23.391
Jason just drafted me.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.683
What other choice I got?

11:30.898 --> 11:32.149
[Frankie Lane's
"Some Day" playing]

11:39.657 --> 11:42.118
<i>♪ Some day ♪</i>

11:42.201 --> 11:43.786
<i>♪ You will see me</i>
<i>And find me ♪</i>

11:43.869 --> 11:44.829
Oh, shit, I'mma wait outside.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.080
Dre.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.873
Stay, stay, stay.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.126
I love an audience.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.044
I'm almost done.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.423
It's my turn.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.258
No, let him finish.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.592
Let me finish.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.847
Oh.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.392
Wait, wait. Oh.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.185
Oh, God.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.816
Get the fuck out of here.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.828
One of my
stashes was raided.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.831
A Toros house.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.791
It's all over the news.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.754
Your Federal agents
seized 86 keys of my product.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.631
Who's fuck

12:38.924 --> 12:40.301
The Serbs were in our port.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.638
We got rid of them.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.391
Took their product.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.394
Now I got
a big shipment coming in.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.021
And I'm counting on you
to make up for the money

12:52.104 --> 12:53.314
that I lost in the raid.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.026
And when are those Bassett
people gonna give you control

12:57.109 --> 12:58.110
of the international clubs too?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.987
I'm on it. I got it.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.489
Well, then be on it.

13:02.615 --> 13:06.410
The death of Uriel has created
a Toros leadership problem.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.288
There's infighting going on
for his spot.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.625
Fix that shit.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.960
And I ain't got time
for fuck-ups.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.213
Neither does my sister.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.966
Whatever you say, Diego.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.094
The translator completed
Maria Suarez's
witness statement,

13:24.178 --> 13:25.804
and we put together
a timeline of her story.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.223
She and her boyfriend Miguel

13:27.306 --> 13:28.891
were forced
in the trunk of a car.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.434
She says towards
the end of the drive,

13:30.518 --> 13:31.977
the road started to get bumpy.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.563
We believe they were traveling
over a cobblestone street,

13:34.647 --> 13:35.940
through
the Meat Packing District.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.691
Suarez says when they were
pulled out of the trunk,

13:37.775 --> 13:39.068
she heard people
and loud music,

13:39.151 --> 13:40.778
like there was
a party going on.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.489
The noise stopped once they
were taken inside the building,

13:43.572 --> 13:45.074
where we believe
they encountered Egan

13:45.157 --> 13:46.408
and St. Patrick.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.868
They were kidnapped
the same night

13:47.952 --> 13:49.745
St. Patrick opened up
his club Truth

13:49.828 --> 13:51.205
in the Meat Packing District.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.832
And Truth has a loading dock.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.709
That's where we think
that they were taken.

14:00.130 --> 14:03.050
You really think
James St. Patrick
would kill a guy

14:03.133 --> 14:04.885
in the loading dock
of his own club?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.763
I mean, this is
a lot of man-hours
and work for nothing.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.307
You're so hard for St. Patrick,
you're honestly gonna parade

14:10.391 --> 14:11.892
a blindfolded witness
in front of a jury?

14:11.976 --> 14:13.686
Mak, she's credible.

14:13.769 --> 14:14.687
She didn't see anything.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.565
If St. Patrick is guilty
of murdering Miguel Alvarez,

14:17.648 --> 14:19.775
he's a drug-dealing
kingpin dirtbag.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.277
If we get him,

14:21.360 --> 14:23.028
we redeem this whole office.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.072
And there's an added bonus.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.615
We end Angela's career.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.284
The fuck?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.536
Is that the reason why you
asked me to keep this from her?

14:30.619 --> 14:32.872
Yeah, and you need
to keep it to yourself.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.373
Tameika's orders.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.709
She knows Angela has
a problem with boundaries

14:36.792 --> 14:38.168
when it comes
to St. Patrick and Egan.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.962
Angela needs to go, for sure,

14:40.379 --> 14:42.339
but Maria Suarez is
not gonna get us there.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.800
There's only one person
that knows the true extent

14:44.884 --> 14:46.260
of St. Patrick's guilt.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.429
I get that person to talk...

14:48.888 --> 14:50.139
It's the witness of a lifetime.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.310
I've got a censure hearing
to prep for.

14:58.647 --> 15:01.483
We're actually gonna be
using the tier level

15:01.567 --> 15:03.611
rewards model for fundraising.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.071
It will incentivize donors
to continue

15:06.155 --> 15:08.616
with their contributions,
and take their giving

15:08.908 --> 15:10.409
to the next level.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.827
You see these?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.121
These are our
fundraising goals.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.083
Well, those are
ambitious numbers, Rashad.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.169
Yes, but not impossible.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.421
See, once we hit
the $15 million mark,

15:22.504 --> 15:24.715
we gonna have an official
ribbon-cutting ceremony.

15:24.798 --> 15:27.092
And we'll make it
a community event.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.261
We'll celebrate and showcase
the youth that benefit

15:29.345 --> 15:30.721
from the QCP.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.139
Okay.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.892
So where do we start?
How can I help?

15:38.854 --> 15:41.023
James.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.566
To be perfectly honest,

15:42.650 --> 15:45.945
all the unanswered questions
surrounding Raina's death

15:46.028 --> 15:47.696
are bad for business.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.742
It leaves open questions
as to why

15:51.825 --> 15:53.869
a supposedly clean guy like you

15:53.953 --> 15:55.371
suddenly has a dead daughter.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.291
It's gonna prevent investors
from getting on board.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.670
We need to solve
Raina's murder.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.174
The investigation
is out of my hands.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.550
And the police are doing
everything they can.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.094
It's not enough.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.387
Now, if you and your wife

16:11.470 --> 16:13.347
would be willing to do
a press conference,

16:13.931 --> 16:15.182
offer a reward,

16:15.265 --> 16:17.643
it would help the NYPD
get some leads.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.854
It'll also be beneficial

16:20.938 --> 16:22.940
in amplifying QCP's cause,

16:23.023 --> 16:26.235
and compelling donors to open
up their checkbooks,

16:26.318 --> 16:27.653
for Raina's legacy.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.784
I'll talk to Tasha about it.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.333
What's up, Sammy?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.043
Let's go for a ride.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.294
I got something I gotta do.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.754
Get in the car.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.769
What is this place?

17:01.603 --> 17:03.105
Connie's not
doing so good.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.773
They got her on
a clinical trial.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.358
Maybe she got the placebo,
they think. I don't know.
Whatever it is,

17:08.027 --> 17:09.445
it ain't looking good.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.531
Sammy, what the fuck
are we doing here?

17:15.617 --> 17:16.952
Fuck.

17:17.953 --> 17:20.289
Now I know why you wasn't
returning my calls.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.208
How'd you find me?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.420
I remembered you and Marco
used to play back here,

17:27.129 --> 17:28.672
when your dad owned the place.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.468
I knew you'd come back here
and wait for him,

17:32.551 --> 17:33.677
hoping he'd show up.

17:33.761 --> 17:34.845
He didn't make it?

17:36.972 --> 17:39.892
Cops found his body
and notified his parents.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.436
His pop came to see Vincent.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.065
He knows what happened.
Marco's gone.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.941
You're missing,
he don't know why.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.319
Carmine,
what the fuck happened?

17:52.404 --> 17:55.365
The guy you hired us
to grab was strapped.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.825
We had him.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.204
But he got the drop on us
and ran.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.290
Fuck, Sammy.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.626
We gotta tell Vincent
what happened.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.504
That you hired us, Tommy.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.091
That's not the way
we do things.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.675
He's Vincent's godson.

18:14.676 --> 18:15.886
I wanna talk to Teresi.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.513
I just need to figure this out.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.560
-Carmine.
-Mm-hmm.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.104
Want me to call your parents?

18:25.896 --> 18:26.897
Nah.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.108
I'll be all right.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.526
All right, we're gonna
come back later

18:30.609 --> 18:31.819
with the doc.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.570
Get you some fresh bandages.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.658
If it were me,

18:37.741 --> 18:39.493
I would've fucked
the older sister. I mean, she gives better head.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.996
You're too caught up on age,
you know?

18:43.080 --> 18:44.623
Yeah, no, I hear you.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.127
Almost lost my appetite.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.711
All right,
I'll see you, Joe.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.921
What do you want?

18:51.421 --> 18:53.465
Your bar committee hearing
is coming up.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.926
And the conflict of interest
charge is an egregious one.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.052
Hmm.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.054
I got a hunch things aren't
gonna end well for you.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.974
Ah, it's not my first time
to the rodeo.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.475
It'll work out.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.144
It always does.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.397
What if I said that

19:08.480 --> 19:10.440
I'd withdraw
the bar complaint if you

19:10.524 --> 19:11.984
give me some
background information

19:12.067 --> 19:13.152
on some of
your clients?

19:14.403 --> 19:15.946
You're gonna save
my law license

19:16.029 --> 19:17.656
so I could break the law?

19:18.115 --> 19:19.283
That's a good one, John.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.285
You come up with that one
by yourself?

19:22.286 --> 19:24.288
Which clients do you
want me to rat on? I'm not gonna tell you
until you agree to do it.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.001
Then I guess you're gonna
have to go without.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.628
Good luck trying to get an
indictment without my help.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.088
Can I get the check, please?

19:33.714 --> 19:35.340
You know, don't pretend
you're a decent guy

19:35.424 --> 19:37.342
who cares
about his clients, Joe.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.137
But I do know you care
about your daughter.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.640
How are you gonna
take care of her
if you can't practice law?

19:54.067 --> 19:55.611
Where were you
this morning?

19:56.528 --> 19:57.988
I had to run an errand.

19:59.489 --> 20:00.741
Where are you going?

20:00.824 --> 20:02.117
I have to run an errand.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.913
I need to talk to you
about Tariq.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.915
And I need to talk to you
about Tate, Tasha.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.042
Look, he wants us to hold
a press conference.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.920
Offer a reward for anybody
that has information
on Raina's killer.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.631
No, absolutely not.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.300
Tate just thinks it would help
secure money from investors

20:18.383 --> 20:20.052
and help getting
the QCP off the ground.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.345
So we can honor Raina.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.639
I'm not stopping
till the building's up.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.099
There's no way we're doing
that press conference, Ghost.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.101
We know
who killed Raina.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.187
Any information that
comes out about Ray Ray

20:30.270 --> 20:31.647
could lead back to Tariq.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.149
Who else knows about
Tariq and Ray Ray?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.609
Who else knows
they knew each other?

20:35.692 --> 20:37.402
Dre.
Besides that, I don't know.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.030
You need to ask
your friend Kanan.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.573
He set them up.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.284
You need to find out if there's
anybody else out there

20:44.368 --> 20:45.577
who could give Tariq a motive.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.204
Put his name in a cop's mouth.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.789
I'll ask him.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.628
Look, I wanna send
Tariq to Choate.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.339
I think it'd be good
for him to get away...

20:57.422 --> 20:58.507
from everything.

20:59.007 --> 20:59.967
I'll think about it.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.843
But I gotta tell you,

21:02.344 --> 21:03.595
there's a big part
of me now, Tasha,

21:03.679 --> 21:05.889
that doesn't wanna let our son
out of my sight.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.602
Good night.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.192
Yo, I saw in the news,

21:17.276 --> 21:20.112
your man Callahan got got
in a park or some shit.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.238
Damn.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.240
That's crazy.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.492
I knew he was running guns
for the Albanians,

21:25.575 --> 21:27.286
so he probably pissed them off
or some shit.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.871
But we need to find someone
else to move his product.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.833
But, yo, the first Jimenez
shipment is coming in.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.376
The first time we're moving
weight for them.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.585
I'm counting on you to be there

21:35.669 --> 21:37.004
to take delivery
of the product.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.381
-Hell, yeah, no doubt.
-My man.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.092
Yo, could you
give us a minute, man?

21:42.175 --> 21:43.468
Nah, I'mma sit right here.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.137
Nah, he's cool.
He could stay.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.472
You find out what's poppin'
with the Toros?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.391
Yeah.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.852
The Toros'
number two, Lorenzo,

21:51.935 --> 21:54.604
he's beefing with Uriel's
cousin, Arturo.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.565
Arturo thinks Lorenzo
killed Uriel

21:56.648 --> 21:57.983
so he could take
over the Toros.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.360
So who do you think
should take that spot?

22:00.777 --> 22:02.487
Lorenzo's been
on the block a minute.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.239
He could hit
the ground running.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.199
Arturo's young.
He don't know shit.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.661
If he don't know shit,
you could tell him what to do.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.790
I like that.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.336
I want Arturo, the young cat,
I want him to fill that spot.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.005
Easy to control and he
won't try to fuck with me.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.007
I don't think
that's the right move.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.260
Well, it's the move I'm making.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.887
We gotta get Lorenzo
out the picture.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.305
I'll hire hitters.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.682
We can't have our
fingerprints on this shit.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.769
Then we're gonna have
to off the hitters
after they do the job.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.480
It's the only way
to keep this away from us.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.939
That's a lot of bodies, man.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.943
It's a necessary move.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.153
No loose ends.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.821
I'll call the hitters, Cris,

22:44.905 --> 22:46.907
when they're done,
you take 'em out.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.210
We could get him
right now.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.545
No doubt, but we need
that nigga to lead us

23:00.629 --> 23:01.922
to the Jimenez.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.219
Sorry about your kid.

23:11.264 --> 23:13.809
Tariq tried to step up, though.
He a tough little nigga.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.852
Yeah, we handled it.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.729
K, let me ask you something.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.148
Who else knew that Tariq was
fucking with Ray Ray,

23:20.232 --> 23:21.566
besides you and Dre?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.026
Brains knew about it.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.778
We pulled a lick with him.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.571
Brains?
You got a real name?

23:26.655 --> 23:29.741
David Struthers, or Smothers,
or some shit like that.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.034
But he ain't been around.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.786
Ain't nobody seen him
in a minute.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.413
Brains wouldn't fuck
with Tariq.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.082
He know that'd be
fucking with me.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.503
I know you don't like it,
but the boy a gangsta.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.921
It was born in him.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.340
Better than you
at that age.

23:45.423 --> 23:46.716
He cold with it.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.011
And you the meanest little
nigga I ever met, so...

23:51.179 --> 23:53.431
I don't want that life
for Tariq, K.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.684
As for me,

23:55.767 --> 23:57.644
once I'm done with Dre,
I'm out the game for good, man.

23:57.727 --> 23:58.937
I mean it.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.022
Tommy's Italians
fucked you up, man.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.357
Wouldn't even be sitting there
right now

24:02.440 --> 24:03.817
if it wasn't for Tommy.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.945
Dre'd be dead and you'd be out.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.415
I see you're not on
Joe Proctor's list

24:18.498 --> 24:20.625
of character witnesses
for his censure hearing.

24:20.709 --> 24:21.710
He doesn't need me.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.420
Oh, yes, he does.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.589
You're on the Board
of Destroy Injustice,

24:25.672 --> 24:27.507
and you just tried
a big press case together,

24:27.591 --> 24:28.925
which you won.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.261
And I assume that
bitter taste in your mouth

24:31.344 --> 24:32.596
is what brought you here.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.097
Proctor got disqualified

24:34.181 --> 24:36.141
from a case you were
working on together.

24:36.224 --> 24:38.393
Your testimony
at his censure hearing

24:38.476 --> 24:40.312
is of the utmost importance.

24:40.395 --> 24:41.771
The hearing committee
won't be able to make

24:41.855 --> 24:43.398
an informed decision
without you.

24:43.481 --> 24:45.358
If you're not on the list,

24:45.442 --> 24:47.944
I assume it's because you have
something negative to say.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.363
I'm not into servicing
personal vendettas, John.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.406
Especially yours.

24:51.489 --> 24:52.574
Whoa. Very negative.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.662
Would a subpoena
help change your mind?

25:21.019 --> 25:22.479
So what'd you find out?

25:24.105 --> 25:25.815
Kanan says he only knows
one person

25:25.899 --> 25:27.400
who can tie
Tariq to Ray Ray.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.569
A David Struthers, Smothers.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.446
Street name "Brains."

25:31.529 --> 25:32.781
Kanan thinks he's dead,

25:32.864 --> 25:34.908
which means we could be
in the clear.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.369
Good. Thanks for asking him.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.747
We gotta get Tariq
away from Kanan.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.082
From all of it.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.792
Yeah, I agree.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.003
Let's say we send
Tariq to Choate

25:47.087 --> 25:48.421
like we planned before...

25:49.631 --> 25:50.840
Um...

25:52.509 --> 25:54.135
You know, I haven't been
in here since, um...

25:54.219 --> 25:55.637
Yeah, I know.

25:56.471 --> 25:57.847
You can't come in.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.226
And I can't leave.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.900
Reverend Macedon has
a grief group at the church.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.277
I really think we should go.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.070
Yeah, I don't need
no grief group.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.446
But I do.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.323
I do.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.784
Can you just do it?

26:18.785 --> 26:19.786
For me?

26:21.371 --> 26:22.455
All right.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.590
How do these people
know Tariq?

27:15.383 --> 27:16.968
Ready for the meeting.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.262
Saxe said you have
something big?

27:19.346 --> 27:21.514
Yes, I'm ready.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.771
We have a hit on the gold gun.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.774
Matched it to a homicide
in Manhattan.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.317
The body of Celeste Cruz

27:32.400 --> 27:34.903
was found along with her
husband, Mason Cruz.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.613
She died from a gunshot wound,

27:36.696 --> 27:38.114
while his cause of death was

27:38.198 --> 27:40.742
some kind of
execution-style drug overdose.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.370
A La Arana card was
dropped on the bodies,

27:43.453 --> 27:45.997
and the couple's baby
is missing.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.166
I had the cocaine
from the crime scene analyzed.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.377
It had the same
chemical composition

27:50.460 --> 27:52.545
as the bricks that we seized
at the Toros pad.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.422
So it's fair to say
the Jimenez brothers

27:54.506 --> 27:56.007
are the Toros' connect.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.884
Do we have a motive
for the murder?

27:57.967 --> 28:00.720
The Jimenez somehow got word
that Celeste Cruz

28:00.804 --> 28:01.930
was gonna snitch.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.348
He took care of the problem.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.767
We're looking
for Jimenez's hitters.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.894
Saxe, reach out to
the NYPD precinct

28:07.977 --> 28:09.145
working the Cruz homicide,

28:09.229 --> 28:10.855
and have them
send over their files.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.982
I wanna review
any surveillance footage

28:13.066 --> 28:14.150
they've collected.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.361
They don't know who to look
for in the cartel level,

28:16.444 --> 28:17.445
but we do.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.072
Whoever owns this gold gun

28:19.155 --> 28:21.741
was at, both,
the Cruz crime scene
and the Toros pad.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.910
They're our link
to the Jimenez brothers.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.414
Nice work, Angela.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.582
If we can
convict the Jimenez,

28:29.666 --> 28:32.794
everyone in this room
is going to the big leagues.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.719
Tommy, good to see you.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.220
Yeah, good to see you too.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.180
I'm sorry to hear about Connie.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.057
What're you talking about?

28:46.141 --> 28:49.269
Sammy said something about
the clinical trial not working.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.442
Whatever you do,

28:56.359 --> 28:57.902
don't you tell her
you're my kid.

28:58.194 --> 29:01.197
That'd put her in a grave
sooner rather than later.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.825
Yeah, okay.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.289
I heard you threw a party.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.083
And a couple of guests
didn't show up.

29:12.917 --> 29:16.588
The problem is you didn't
invite the guest of honor.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.801
Now you're gonna tell him
you threw that party.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.012
And he's gonna be pissed.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.890
And you're going to
apologize like a man.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.309
And you're gonna take whatever
punishment he hands you.

29:29.392 --> 29:30.518
You understand me?

29:31.686 --> 29:32.979
Yeah, okay.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.275
You should've come to me first.

29:48.745 --> 29:51.706
In conclusion, I submit
that the allegations

29:51.790 --> 29:52.957
filed against me

29:53.041 --> 29:55.919
are the malicious fabrications
of a prosecutor,

29:56.002 --> 29:57.295
John Mak,

29:57.378 --> 29:59.464
focused on ruining
my good name

29:59.547 --> 30:01.466
for his own
petty sense of revenge.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.260
He lost his case against
my innocent client.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.304
We're all just wasting
our time here

30:06.387 --> 30:08.139
with John Mak's sour grapes.

30:08.681 --> 30:11.768
Mr. Proctor, this
is your third censure hearing.

30:12.101 --> 30:13.019
Why?

30:13.394 --> 30:14.896
Unlucky, I guess.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.690
It's documented that two
witnesses who were scheduled

30:17.774 --> 30:19.275
to give their
testimonies disappeared

30:19.359 --> 30:21.152
before your other hearings.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.278
Yes.

30:22.779 --> 30:23.905
Any idea
what happened to them?

30:23.988 --> 30:25.323
I don't know.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.367
Did any of your
other clients at the time

30:27.450 --> 30:29.327
have something to do
with their disappearance?

30:29.410 --> 30:30.495
No.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.748
And I resent the implication
that I would ask another client

30:33.832 --> 30:35.708
to commit a crime on my behalf.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.544
Or silence a witness.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.379
I'm not a gangster.

30:40.421 --> 30:43.842
Off that, public records
show that your birth name

30:43.925 --> 30:46.719
is Joseph Civello,
not Proctor.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.555
Why did you change
your last name?

30:48.638 --> 30:50.473
My father died.

30:50.557 --> 30:51.975
When my mother remarried, I took my stepfather's
last name.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.020
Yes, your father died in 1984,

30:56.104 --> 30:58.940
after he was acquitted
of attempted murder.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.067
Your paternal side
of the family

31:01.150 --> 31:02.986
has quite the legacy
of documented convictions

31:03.069 --> 31:04.404
and criminality, correct?

31:04.487 --> 31:05.655
Yes.

31:06.447 --> 31:08.491
That's why I changed
my last name.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.493
Because that is not who I am.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.955
I became
a criminal defense attorney

31:14.038 --> 31:15.415
because I believe in justice.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.750
Because I'm a patriot,
Miss Navarro.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.128
Ours is the noblest
of all professions.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.756
Just because I stand beside
criminals in rooms like this

31:23.840 --> 31:26.092
does not mean I am a criminal.

31:29.637 --> 31:32.599
We'd like to hear the testimony
of one more witness.

31:33.808 --> 31:36.394
Your co-counsel
during the case at hand,

31:36.477 --> 31:39.606
United States
versus James St. Patrick.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.442
Mr. Silver, you do realize
your testimony is under oath?

31:42.525 --> 31:43.526
Yes.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.278
During the preliminary hearing

31:45.361 --> 31:47.780
for your mutual client,
James St. Patrick,

31:48.156 --> 31:50.867
were you aware that your
co-counsel had previously

31:50.950 --> 31:53.161
represented
Thomas Patrick Egan?

31:53.244 --> 31:54.454
Yes.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.040
And did you feel there was
a conflict of interest

31:57.123 --> 31:58.917
between Mr. St. Patrick
and Mr. Egan?

31:59.500 --> 32:00.335
Yes.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.378
He advised our client,
James St. Patrick,

32:02.462 --> 32:04.631
not to take a deal at a
critical juncture in the case.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.050
Most attorneys I know
would've behaved differently.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.968
Did you ever express this
to Mr. Proctor?

32:10.970 --> 32:12.055
I did.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.349
Did you ask him
to recuse himself?

32:14.432 --> 32:15.642
I did, but

32:17.852 --> 32:20.021
He told me
it wasn't a conflict,

32:20.104 --> 32:22.565
and asked me not
to speak of it again.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.902
In your opinion, is Joe Proctor
an ethical attorney?

32:29.989 --> 32:31.449
Mr. Silver?

32:32.533 --> 32:34.869
I think there's a gray area

32:34.953 --> 32:37.080
in criminal defense when
your client is innocent,

32:37.163 --> 32:38.665
where perhaps passion

32:38.748 --> 32:41.084
overwhelms
the hard lines of ethics.

32:41.751 --> 32:42.710
So that's a no?

32:43.586 --> 32:45.171
No further questions.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.383
You just said James St. Patrick
was innocent

32:48.466 --> 32:49.717
in our case, right?

32:49.801 --> 32:51.260
I don't think
that's the issue here.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.762
Just answer the question.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.973
-Yes.

32:55.056 --> 32:58.685
So was I out of line when
I advised an innocent client

32:58.768 --> 33:02.063
not to take a deal and
allocute a lie to the court?

33:02.146 --> 33:04.399
I feel your advice was
based on your relationship

33:04.482 --> 33:07.694
to both our client and his
friend, Thomas Patrick Egan.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.737
Their interests did not
converge at that point

33:09.821 --> 33:10.780
in the trial.

33:10.863 --> 33:13.700
Like I said to you then,
James was innocent.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.451
And neither James nor Tommy

33:15.535 --> 33:17.996
wanted James to go to jail
for a crime he didn't commit.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.498
That is not
a conflict of interest.

33:20.581 --> 33:23.042
I know the rules, Joe.
You didn't follow the rules.

33:23.126 --> 33:25.962
Without the rules, this whole
system, it all goes down.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.297
You've never
compromised yourself

33:28.381 --> 33:29.841
for an innocent client before?

33:30.758 --> 33:31.843
No.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.511
I haven't.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.973
No further questions.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.893
We'll take the testimony under
advisement, Mr. Proctor.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.687
We'll get you
a decision soon.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.105
Soon?

33:52.822 --> 33:54.073
Carmine. Come on, wake up.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.118
We gotta go talk to Vincent.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.377
He's dead.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.004
Are you sure?

34:08.254 --> 34:09.714
Check him again!

34:15.178 --> 34:17.180
I told you I get paid
either way.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.102
And you,

34:24.353 --> 34:25.855
you dimed me out to Teresi.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.774
You didn't even give me
a chance to fix this.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.525
Why would I?

34:29.817 --> 34:32.487
Clearly you're out
of your fuckin' league.

34:32.570 --> 34:36.115
Now you gotta explain
two dead guys to Vincent.

34:44.957 --> 34:47.210
Dre put me in charge
of this shipment big time.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.046
Think he might give me
that number two spot?

34:50.129 --> 34:52.173
You been fucking with Dre
longer than anyone,

34:52.256 --> 34:53.591
so I hope the fuck he is,

34:53.674 --> 34:55.343
'cause if you
the number two nigga,

34:55.426 --> 34:57.637
then that makes me
nigga number three.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.180
That's a fact.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.315
Yo, Dre want that Toro dead.

35:09.398 --> 35:10.608
For real?

35:12.401 --> 35:13.820
Yo, Spank.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.154
Bust a U-ey.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.739
I don't think we should be
doing this, man.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.449
-Bust a U-ey, Spank!
-Fuck.

Dr. Wolven,

36:02.076 --> 36:04.412
everyone, I'd like
for you to meet James and Tasha St. Patrick.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.292
Their daughter, Raina,

36:09.375 --> 36:11.627
recently went home
to be with the Lord.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.088
Welcome.
So sorry for your loss.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.673
Please, have a seat.

36:15.756 --> 36:17.133
Thank you.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.597
I'll open us in prayer.

36:24.515 --> 36:25.683
Lord,

36:26.976 --> 36:29.687
thank you
for this time together.

36:30.771 --> 36:33.191
Please bless and comfort

36:33.566 --> 36:35.359
everyone here who is grieving.

36:36.485 --> 36:39.322
We ask these things
in your son's holy name.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.157
Amen.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.117
Amen.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.871
Okay.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.957
Would anyone like to share
how they've been doing?

36:51.834 --> 36:54.503
Jessica and I had
a really hard week.

36:54.962 --> 36:58.466
Wednesday marked
the six-month anniversary

36:58.549 --> 36:59.800
of Luke's death.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.804
Our son, Luke, he was
walking home from school

37:03.888 --> 37:06.015
and was killed
by a drunk driver.

37:06.807 --> 37:09.018
He was a week away
from celebrating

37:09.101 --> 37:10.853
his 16th birthday.

37:12.104 --> 37:14.523
I still sit
in his room sometimes.

37:15.441 --> 37:16.817
I know it sounds crazy,

37:16.901 --> 37:18.527
but sometimes I follow Jeff,

37:18.611 --> 37:20.238
the guy who killed our son,

37:20.529 --> 37:22.573
to Gavin's Liquor on 23rd.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.701
He's always in
his stupid work uniform.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.829
And he always grabs
a bottle of liquor.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.583
It's only a matter of time

37:32.667 --> 37:34.460
before he kills another kid.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.673
Is it wrong to want him dead?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.801
What you're
feeling is normal.

37:41.884 --> 37:44.345
Anger is part
of the grieving process.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.349
Would anyone else

37:48.432 --> 37:49.850
like to share?

37:59.568 --> 38:01.988
I gotta drop you
off now. See you later.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.618
Ghost, I need
to talk to somebody.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.705
Tasha, that's not the most
appropriate place to do that.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.498
Those people don't understand
what we're going through.

38:12.581 --> 38:15.543
I can share how I'm feeling
without saying why.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.461
It's best if we don't
say anything at all.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.345
You know what?

38:26.429 --> 38:28.180
Maybe we should ask
Reverend Macedon

38:28.264 --> 38:29.515
to refer us to a support group

38:29.598 --> 38:31.726
for families
of murdering drug dealers.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.811
They'll understand us,
right, Ghost?

38:46.240 --> 38:48.075
James, my good brother.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.869
Rashad, I talked to Tasha
about the press conference.

38:49.952 --> 38:51.829
She's not in a frame of mind
to do it right now.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.249
Ah, I understand.

38:55.916 --> 38:59.337
Hey, listen, tomorrow I've put
together a last-minute mixer

38:59.420 --> 39:01.213
for the QCP at Borough Hall.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.340
<i>Bring Tasha.</i>

39:02.423 --> 39:04.133
We can show her
the presentation.

39:04.216 --> 39:07.428
Maybe seeing our goals to honor
Raina might lift her spirits.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.096
I'll talk to her again.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.431
My man.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.026
This is the one.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.196
Here are the files you
wanted on the Cruz murders.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.489
Thanks, Darryl.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.825
I never congratulated you
on the promotion.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.828
Despite all the drama,
you made Head of Criminal.

39:33.162 --> 39:35.498
Maybe now you can do
something about IT,

39:35.581 --> 39:36.999
'cause I can't get
my log-in to work.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.419
I'll ask them to fix that.

39:40.503 --> 39:41.879
Thanks, girl.

39:44.048 --> 39:47.134
Hey, you know, I'm sorry
I called you radioactive.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.930
Glad you're away from
that James St. Patrick dude.

39:51.013 --> 39:52.515
Yeah, me too.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.105
Hey, Angie.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.148
I'm not doing that good.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.068
Can you please call me back?

40:05.444 --> 40:06.529
All right.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.212
Cancel the hitters, baby.

40:23.295 --> 40:25.131
I got that nigga Lorenzo
on the block.

40:26.382 --> 40:27.800
The fuck you say? I lit his ass up.

40:29.385 --> 40:30.803
What you mean
you lit his ass up?

40:30.886 --> 40:32.513
You had one job.

40:32.638 --> 40:33.931
To get the shipment.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.558
I did get to the shipment,

40:35.641 --> 40:37.768
and I took
that motherfucker out.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.562
I had a busy fucking day.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.816
Who the fuck else
knows about this?

40:44.608 --> 40:45.443
Spanky?

40:46.152 --> 40:47.903
-He drove.
-Oh, shit.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.489
Why you bugging out, Dre?
I saved you money and time.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.616
Look, man, I can't even
look at you right now.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.243
Get the fuck
out of my face, man.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.328
Get the fuck out of my face!

41:05.296 --> 41:06.672
Your boy fucked this up.

41:07.339 --> 41:09.216
Anybody else finds out
he did this,

41:09.300 --> 41:11.010
-we're all dead.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.929
You need to take him out.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.639
Him and Spanky.

41:15.723 --> 41:16.849
Look, I'll handle it.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.642
From now on, you're running
the Blind Pigs.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.061
Let me just go take this shit
away from them right now.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.193
Yo, why you trippin'?

41:27.610 --> 41:29.236
Your plan, three bodies drop.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.738
My version only one did.

41:30.821 --> 41:33.449
That bitch ass Toro is dead.
It all worked out.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.202
The hit can't come back on us.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.870
Nobody fucking saw me.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.872
Yo, you're not getting
the goddamn point.

41:39.955 --> 41:41.790
When I tell you to do
something,

41:41.874 --> 41:43.459
you do the shit my way.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.253
Oh, shit.

41:47.087 --> 41:48.881
The Jimenez and this club shit
got you really thinking

41:48.964 --> 41:50.674
you better than everybody else?

41:51.842 --> 41:54.970
Just remember, you wasn't shit
when we met, my nigga.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.389
I ain't your nigga
no more, boy.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.684
You work for me, Francis.

42:01.310 --> 42:03.812
And from now on,
you do what I fucking say.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.690
That's my shit.
My organization.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.986
You and Spanky ain't running
the Blind Pigs no more.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.238
Cristobal is.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.407
Spanky didn't do nothing wrong.
Shit was my call.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.617
I don't give a fuck.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.868
I don't wanna hear that shit.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.578
Spanky ain't tell me
you did it,

42:19.662 --> 42:21.997
and he sure as hell ain't
stop you from doing it.

42:37.638 --> 42:40.599
<i> Hey, Angie,</i>
<i>I'm not doing that good.</i>

42:41.308 --> 42:42.810
<i>Can you please call me back?</i>

42:50.192 --> 42:51.652
What did you find out?

42:52.111 --> 42:54.697
David Struthers,
"Brains," is dead.

42:55.906 --> 42:57.700
So, Tariq is safe?

42:59.952 --> 43:03.080
This Brains guy was killed
along with a close associate.

43:03.163 --> 43:05.374
Big Country.
You ever heard of him?

43:05.457 --> 43:06.625
No.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.589
They were participating
in a burglary ring.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.674
The case is still open.

43:14.383 --> 43:15.926
You know anything about that?

43:17.177 --> 43:19.054
Was Raymond Jones
a part of that too?

43:21.140 --> 43:23.934
None of you had anything to do
with Brains and Big Country

43:24.018 --> 43:25.019
being dead, right?

43:25.102 --> 43:26.478
No. No way.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.359
As long as Tariq doesn't
get implicated

43:32.443 --> 43:34.862
in this robbery ring,
you should be okay.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.656
Yeah, well, I'm actually
gonna send him

43:37.740 --> 43:39.283
out of town for a while.

43:39.366 --> 43:40.492
To school. Good idea.

43:48.667 --> 43:52.129
Yo, this is our new boss, Dre.

43:52.546 --> 43:54.465
He's our connect
to the Jimenez.

43:54.548 --> 43:56.925
From now on, we go through him
for everything.

43:57.551 --> 43:58.844
Arturo,

43:58.927 --> 44:01.180
poppin' Lorenzo in that
drive-by was legit.

44:01.263 --> 44:04.266
That grimy-ass traitor deserved
that shit for killing Uriel.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.229
You did that shit, right?

44:11.523 --> 44:12.608
Yeah, I did it.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.487
That's what's up.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.697
That's how the new head
of the Toros rolls.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.324
Welcome to the organization.

44:20.574 --> 44:22.368
I got a shit ton of product
for you to push, all right?

44:22.451 --> 44:24.286
Shit, we down.
Right, guys?

44:24.370 --> 44:25.829
-Let's get it.
-Yeah, yeah.

44:25.913 --> 44:28.082
-All right.
-Yeah, let's get to work.

44:28.165 --> 44:29.458
No doubt.

44:39.301 --> 44:40.928
So, now that nigga Dre dead,

44:41.011 --> 44:43.180
we gonna take over his network
like we talked about?

44:43.263 --> 44:45.265
That shit went sideways, man.

44:45.349 --> 44:46.767
Dre's still alive.

44:46.850 --> 44:48.102
How we gonna make money then?

44:48.185 --> 44:50.521
I met Tommy's connect,
this Serbian motherfucker.

44:50.604 --> 44:52.272
Well, you're gonna have to
learn to speak French -or some shit.
-Russian, nigga.

44:54.608 --> 44:56.110
I'm gonna get in good with him

44:56.193 --> 44:57.820
and then we're gonna take over
Tommy's organization.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.071
Nice.

44:59.154 --> 45:00.823
We gonna make it rain
in the club.

45:00.906 --> 45:02.699
Shit, we could
do that tonight, nigga.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.118
Call the club,
tell 'em we're coming through.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.619
-A'ight.
-Ask for Koko.

45:05.702 --> 45:08.539
See if she work.
Nah, she off to see the wizard.

45:08.622 --> 45:11.291
Ain't got no brain, but
she fine as a motherfucker.

45:14.253 --> 45:15.587
All right?

45:20.759 --> 45:22.594
Pause the game, 'Riq.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.723
Look, your father
and I have decided

45:26.807 --> 45:28.308
to still let you go to Choate.

45:28.392 --> 45:31.061
We think it'd be good for you
to have a fresh start.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.062
Okay.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.273
-All right.

45:35.023 --> 45:38.485
Oh, uh, to an event for
the Queen's Child Project.

45:38.569 --> 45:41.238
The building your
father's dedicating to Raina.

45:44.366 --> 45:46.493
What happened to Raina
is all my fault.

45:47.536 --> 45:48.954
And everyone knows
it's my fault.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.539
Including you.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.376
'Riq.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.421
I don't like
the choices you made, no.

45:57.504 --> 46:00.507
But I'm still your mother.

46:01.842 --> 46:04.386
And I'm always gonna love you.

46:04.470 --> 46:05.596
Okay?

46:10.058 --> 46:11.894
Brains and Big Country
are dead.

46:13.145 --> 46:14.271
Who told you about them?

46:15.439 --> 46:17.149
Kanan told your father.

46:18.317 --> 46:19.943
But you should've told me.

46:20.652 --> 46:22.613
I mean, why didn't you tell us
there was still more people

46:22.696 --> 46:24.072
out there, Tariq?

46:25.157 --> 46:27.493
I don't know, I was just
trying to forget about it.

46:28.702 --> 46:30.871
Well, do I know everything now?

46:33.040 --> 46:34.082
Yes.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.545
I'm gonna make better choices
from now on, Ma.

46:39.379 --> 46:40.506
I promise.

46:41.757 --> 46:42.883
I know you will.

46:43.592 --> 46:45.010
I don't want you to worry.

46:46.094 --> 46:48.847
If anyone at Choate asks about
what happened to Raina,

46:49.181 --> 46:50.390
I won't say anything.

46:50.891 --> 46:52.017
Like you taught us.

46:54.019 --> 46:56.271
I'm gonna miss you
so much, Tariq.

47:06.281 --> 47:09.117
Our community wants answers.

47:13.288 --> 47:14.581
Ladies and gentlemen,

47:15.082 --> 47:18.126
despite still grieving
Raina's tragic death,

47:18.544 --> 47:21.672
her parents,
James and Tasha St. Patrick

47:22.089 --> 47:23.340
are here with us,

47:24.550 --> 47:26.510
and would like
to say a few words.

47:27.094 --> 47:28.971
Come on up, please.

47:39.439 --> 47:40.482
Mrs. St. Patrick.

47:50.492 --> 47:52.911
We miss our
beautiful baby girl.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.373
These have been
the worst days of our lives,

47:56.456 --> 47:59.084
and my wife and I are thankful
for your prayers

47:59.167 --> 48:00.252
and your support.

48:08.552 --> 48:11.471
I wanna tell you about
our daughter, Raina.

48:12.764 --> 48:14.516
She was good to people.

48:15.267 --> 48:17.227
She had a beautiful
singing voice.

48:17.853 --> 48:19.354
And she was smart.

48:20.606 --> 48:22.899
What happened to her is wrong.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.028
It's unfair.

48:27.279 --> 48:29.740
It's unfair that she'll never
get to blow out the candles

48:29.823 --> 48:31.450
for her sweet 16.

48:33.285 --> 48:34.786
Or go to prom.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.251
Or walk down the aisle
on her wedding day.

48:42.502 --> 48:45.088
There's someone out there
who robbed her,

48:46.256 --> 48:48.008
and robbed us

48:49.718 --> 48:51.887
of her beautiful future.

48:54.723 --> 48:57.142
We tried to protect her.

48:58.143 --> 48:59.311
We tried.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.648
But I can't help
but feel responsible.

49:05.692 --> 49:08.528
We are all responsible.

49:17.537 --> 49:20.123
Tommy Egan
is Tony Teresi's kid?

49:20.457 --> 49:22.042
Looks that way.

49:22.459 --> 49:25.170
That's a particularly
twisted gene pool.

49:25.253 --> 49:27.172
He's gone twice to see him
in recent weeks.

49:27.255 --> 49:29.591
No record of him
visiting before that.

49:29.675 --> 49:30.884
So it's a new relationship?

49:32.260 --> 49:34.763
Question is, why now?

49:40.268 --> 49:42.020
What the fuck happened to him?

49:43.772 --> 49:46.817
I hired your god kid
and Marco to grab a guy

49:46.900 --> 49:49.569
I had beef with
and shit went sideways.

49:53.615 --> 49:57.452
We got two sets of parents
with dead kids.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.621
I don't take that casually.

50:02.499 --> 50:03.917
We're all family.

50:06.128 --> 50:07.921
Vincent, I know this don't make
things right,

50:08.004 --> 50:11.216
but I took care of the guy
that did this to your family.

50:13.009 --> 50:14.511
That true, Sammy?

50:16.304 --> 50:17.472
He took care of it?

50:18.765 --> 50:20.892
Yeah. He made it right.

50:25.063 --> 50:26.732
I appreciate you being
straight with me,

50:26.815 --> 50:27.816
but you owe me.

50:30.694 --> 50:33.321
You're gonna take a 50%
cut on our drug profits,

50:33.405 --> 50:35.699
and you're gonna
pay restitution
to these kids' families.

50:35.782 --> 50:36.867
Absolutely.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.368
And Vincent,

50:39.369 --> 50:40.829
I am truly sorry.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.374
I didn't mean no disrespect
to the family.

50:45.083 --> 50:46.835
Your father's a good man.

50:48.003 --> 50:50.630
Kept his mouth shut and he's
rotting away in a prison cell

50:50.714 --> 50:52.174
to protect this family.

50:55.927 --> 50:57.679
Don't tarnish his name.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.441
Yo, Sammy,
thanks for covering for me.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.359
Sammy, what the--

51:13.195 --> 51:14.529
I told Teresi

51:15.113 --> 51:16.656
I wouldn't let
Vincent hurt you.

51:17.157 --> 51:19.868
I'm not lying for you
ever again.

51:30.086 --> 51:32.255
-We'll get 'em next week.
-Thanks.

51:34.090 --> 51:35.467
Get the fuck off me.

51:35.550 --> 51:36.676
You set me up.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.553
No, Tasha,
Tate set both of us up. -Tasha, wait.
-Fuck you.

51:41.431 --> 51:44.518
Wow, my brother,
you two were amazing up there.

51:44.601 --> 51:46.686
You ambushed us
to go on camera.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.522
That was fucking low, Rashad.

51:49.022 --> 51:51.775
James, it'll all pay off.

51:52.108 --> 51:52.984
Trust me.

51:53.819 --> 51:55.904
I'll be in contact as soon as
the QCP numbers

51:55.987 --> 51:57.197
start coming in.

51:58.865 --> 52:00.784
Gentlemen,
I appreciate you coming out.

52:00.867 --> 52:02.619
I reviewed
the surveillance footage

52:02.702 --> 52:05.789
from the Cruz crime scene
that precinct 74 sent over.

52:05.872 --> 52:07.332
It wasn't a Jimenez hitter

52:07.415 --> 52:09.376
that murdered Celeste
and left the gold gun

52:09.459 --> 52:11.127
at the Toros pad.

52:11.211 --> 52:13.338
It was Diego Jimenez himself.

52:13.421 --> 52:15.298
He's here in the States.

52:15.382 --> 52:17.926
Holy fucking shit.
They're never here.

52:18.009 --> 52:19.886
Diego exited right
through the front doors,

52:19.970 --> 52:22.180
along with a woman
carrying a swaddled baby.

52:22.264 --> 52:25.183
To the detectives,
they look like a regular couple

52:25.267 --> 52:26.768
living in the building,
leaving for the day.

52:26.852 --> 52:28.144
And they weren't alone.

52:28.228 --> 52:29.563
Two other known
Jimenez associates

52:29.646 --> 52:31.356
were seen exiting
through a side door.

52:31.439 --> 52:32.899
Who's the woman,
his wife? We don't know yet.

52:34.693 --> 52:36.903
We don't know
who anyone is yet.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.488
But if she is,

52:38.572 --> 52:40.031
I can get her to talk.

52:59.217 --> 53:01.344
Karen was right about you, Dre.

53:01.428 --> 53:03.388
This is an amazing
opening night.

53:03.471 --> 53:05.807
She might be sending you to
Paris sooner rather than later.

53:05.891 --> 53:07.475
Well, thank you, Quinn.

53:08.268 --> 53:11.396
But first, I need you to deal
with some asshole in VIP.

53:11.479 --> 53:13.481
Ordered three bottles
of Dom and won't pay.

53:13.565 --> 53:14.774
Says he knows you.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.527
All right, I'll handle it.
I'll be right back.

53:22.866 --> 53:24.910
My fucking name
is not Vanessa.

53:31.541 --> 53:33.001
I like your system.

53:35.045 --> 53:36.379
I know what I'm doing. Take care of
that Toros problem?

53:37.881 --> 53:39.090
Oh, yeah, I got that on lock.

53:41.509 --> 53:42.510
Good.

53:43.345 --> 53:44.512
Now...

53:50.268 --> 53:53.146
I want you to fuck Francesca
for a job well done.

53:54.064 --> 53:56.524
I'm good, I'm working.

53:58.610 --> 53:59.819
Now.

54:12.999 --> 54:15.210
How much to tell him
we did this shit?

54:16.795 --> 54:18.296
That's not gonna work.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.590
Look, he'll smell my pussy
if he has to.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.801
If I'm dry, I'm dead.

54:22.968 --> 54:24.135
And so are you.

54:24.761 --> 54:27.722
So, let's just have some fun.

54:27.806 --> 54:29.140
Okay?

54:30.600 --> 54:32.143
Mmm.

54:57.752 --> 54:59.004
My turn to watch.

54:59.212 --> 55:00.296
I'm good, man.

55:00.588 --> 55:02.048
