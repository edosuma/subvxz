WEBVTT

00:04.820 --> 00:06.454
Head straight to the airport.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.452
Ticket is in your name at the counter.

00:08.489 --> 00:09.609
See you soon.

00:09.646 --> 00:11.116
The entire building's wired.

00:11.153 --> 00:12.927
I just need to rig the C4
and we're good to go.

00:12.995 --> 00:15.496
Good. I'll call you when
it's time to pull the trigger.

00:15.671 --> 00:17.484
Hey, how big do you want it?

00:17.521 --> 00:18.966
I can do a smaller, controlled blast

00:19.034 --> 00:21.202
where some of the walls
are still standing at the end,

00:21.239 --> 00:22.539
or I can go much bigger,

00:22.576 --> 00:24.405
like "make it shake
in Long Island" bigger.

00:24.527 --> 00:26.788
My employer wants no trace
of this building,

00:26.825 --> 00:28.157
- or anything in it.
- Gotcha.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.929
Obliterate it. I can do that.

00:30.045 --> 00:31.345
Frankie!

00:31.413 --> 00:33.347
Let's double up the charges!

00:36.852 --> 00:38.252
At some point I'm gonna need to get

00:38.320 --> 00:40.015
the name of your interior designer.

00:40.052 --> 00:41.352
Your office was stunning.

00:41.489 --> 00:45.259
Modern minimalist meets
art deco meets Tony Stark.

00:45.296 --> 00:47.368
And that huge, evil tree
behind your desk?

00:47.405 --> 00:49.882
Ohh! Exquisite.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.468
How on earth have you survived

00:52.505 --> 00:54.606
working for the Sabanito Cartel?

00:55.837 --> 00:57.338
Real men aren't afraid to acknowledge

00:57.406 --> 00:58.839
a strong design aesthetic.

00:58.907 --> 01:00.341
This is a long way to go
to take down a plane.

01:00.409 --> 01:01.776
Are you sure it's worth it?

01:01.843 --> 01:03.210
Getting cold feet?

01:03.278 --> 01:05.134
No. I just want to know

01:05.171 --> 01:06.771
what plane we're hitting
so I can understand...

01:06.807 --> 01:08.215
You know everything you need to know

01:08.283 --> 01:09.720
to do what's required of you.

01:09.757 --> 01:11.976
The rest will reveal
itself soon enough.

01:15.835 --> 01:18.970
Really enjoying this whole
mystery and intrigue thing.

01:19.661 --> 01:21.028
It's like a Vince Flynn novel,

01:21.096 --> 01:23.491
or maybe like a Brad Thor audiobook.

01:23.530 --> 01:25.232
So, is this...
Oh, are you thinking like

01:25.300 --> 01:27.535
a private plane situation,
or are we talking

01:27.602 --> 01:28.970
more commercial type deal?

01:29.037 --> 01:30.638
The target is a jumbo-liner

01:30.706 --> 01:32.940
manufactured by Bradley Dynamics,

01:33.008 --> 01:34.742
which is why you have to
hack into its server

01:34.810 --> 01:36.610
and gain control
of its aeronautics system.

01:36.678 --> 01:38.913
When does it fly?
It's in the air as we speak.

01:38.981 --> 01:41.603
Your task is to bring it down
before its scheduled landing

01:41.640 --> 01:42.883
in D.C. in three hours.

01:42.951 --> 01:44.552
I'm sorry... heh.

01:44.835 --> 01:48.055
We have three hours
to hack into Bradley Dynamics

01:48.123 --> 01:49.723
and figure out a way to target

01:49.760 --> 01:51.718
a plane that's already in the air?

01:52.369 --> 01:54.862
Bradley Dynamics has
the highest level of security

01:54.930 --> 01:56.551
of any defense contractor.

01:56.588 --> 01:59.403
They're like... Fort Knox of aerospace.

01:59.471 --> 02:01.302
And you're the Babe Ruth of hackers.

02:01.370 --> 02:03.704
So, it's a match made in heaven.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.975 --> 02:19.751
Should be sufficient, no?

02:19.788 --> 02:21.756
Multi-core fiber optic
Internet connection.

02:22.045 --> 02:24.356
Lightning-fast
microprocessors, jammers.

02:24.526 --> 02:25.693
Scanner software.

02:25.761 --> 02:28.429
Yeah, I should be able to make do.

02:29.564 --> 02:30.798
You keep an eye on him.

02:30.866 --> 02:32.600
When the work is done, I'll send a car,

02:32.667 --> 02:34.402
and we'll talk about next steps.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.470
For just me?

02:36.639 --> 02:38.673
One thing at a time, Tasha.

02:44.611 --> 02:47.661
All right? Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.550
Are you sure they can't hear us?

02:49.618 --> 02:51.391
I've got a scrambler
sewn into my jacket.

02:51.696 --> 02:54.088
We just do some fake hacking
and we're good, right?

02:54.156 --> 02:55.508
No, not good.

02:55.555 --> 02:58.103
Madeline is going to
monitor every keystroke.

02:58.493 --> 03:00.133
You're gonna have to hack
into Bradley Dynamics,

03:00.169 --> 03:02.997
for real, but stop short
of actually crashing a plane.

03:03.065 --> 03:04.432
Okay, yeah. For sure.

03:04.499 --> 03:06.000
Quick question: Are you insane?

03:06.107 --> 03:07.427
We don't have a choice.

03:07.464 --> 03:09.804
Just stop short
of causing any real damage.

03:10.737 --> 03:12.872
Meanwhile, we have to figure out
a way to get word back to the team

03:12.909 --> 03:14.989
so we're not sitting ducks once
our three-hour window closes,

03:15.025 --> 03:16.603
and she realizes we're not on her side.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.545
Okay, anything else you'd
like to add to my to-do list?

03:18.581 --> 03:20.121
Spinning straw into gold, perhaps?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.482
You can do this.

03:21.550 --> 03:23.392
You don't know that.
That's just a thing you said!

03:23.462 --> 03:26.422
Just in case you can't, I'm gonna
figure out a way to get us out of here.

03:27.293 --> 03:29.452
Kinda preferred
the false confidence thing.

03:29.489 --> 03:31.746
Can we circle back to that, please?

03:39.328 --> 03:41.263
Your test results came back negative.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.865
There's no trace of ZIP
left in your system.

03:43.933 --> 03:46.377
I want you to take it easy
for the next 24 hours or so,

03:46.414 --> 03:48.703
but after that you can
resume normal activities.

03:48.771 --> 03:51.640
Thank you so much, Doctor.

03:55.771 --> 03:57.205
See?

03:57.547 --> 03:59.181
I told you it'd be okay.

04:00.118 --> 04:02.853
And now... it's over.

04:03.219 --> 04:04.853
So, what do you want to do
with the first day

04:04.890 --> 04:06.172
of the rest of your life?

04:06.209 --> 04:08.744
I don't care what I do,
as long as it's with you.

04:09.025 --> 04:11.018
When I thought I was dying,

04:11.055 --> 04:13.394
all I wanted was more time together.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.315
And... now we have it.

04:15.531 --> 04:16.865
Yeah.

04:17.547 --> 04:19.213
I was lookin' at a place upstate

04:19.298 --> 04:20.802
to celebrate our anniversary.

04:21.069 --> 04:22.871
It's a little cabin in the woods.

04:22.939 --> 04:25.558
I can call, see if
that's still available.

04:26.075 --> 04:29.544
We can go up there, spend the night.

04:29.841 --> 04:32.447
No distractions, no work.

04:32.515 --> 04:33.813
Just us.

04:33.850 --> 04:35.146
What about the case?

04:35.183 --> 04:37.663
I knew you'd ask that.
I checked in with Reade.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.310
We're still in a holding pattern, so...

04:40.458 --> 04:43.375
if they need us, then they can call us.

04:43.430 --> 04:45.260
Sounds perfect.

04:48.633 --> 04:49.988
Any word from Zapata?

04:50.025 --> 04:51.587
Nothing yet, but it is still early.

04:51.626 --> 04:53.353
Hey, why don't we send a team
to Madeline's office

04:53.390 --> 04:55.128
just to make sure that
what's-her-name is okay?

04:55.164 --> 04:57.004
Oh, you mean make sure Boston is okay?

04:57.041 --> 04:58.664
Yeah, him too, I mean,
if you're really worried about it.

04:58.700 --> 04:59.800
We could blow their cover.

04:59.868 --> 05:01.135
We should probably just sit tight.

05:01.202 --> 05:02.469
Okay, look.

05:02.537 --> 05:04.119
I gotta say something here, all right?

05:04.156 --> 05:06.049
Boston is not the best actor.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.529
I mean, role-playing
is a different story.

05:07.565 --> 05:09.376
You should see him do
sexy "My Cousin Vinny,"

05:09.444 --> 05:11.879
but straight-up lying,
he has no poker face.

05:11.946 --> 05:13.414
Might have been good to know,

05:13.481 --> 05:15.082
before we sent him in as Del Toro.

05:15.150 --> 05:17.030
What are you snapping at me for?
That wasn't my decision.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.419
Know what?
Maybe we can set up a meeting

05:18.486 --> 05:20.086
with Madeline without
getting her suspicious.

05:20.122 --> 05:21.297
I'm down. And also, we could

05:21.334 --> 05:22.703
check on the sniffer that <i>como se llama</i>

05:22.740 --> 05:24.170
was supposed to plant for us.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.492
I am taking him out, right now.

05:26.529 --> 05:28.562
No!
We still need him to down that plane.

05:28.865 --> 05:30.206
Getting a look at Madeline's hard drive

05:30.243 --> 05:31.655
would be super helpful right now.

05:31.692 --> 05:32.959
Let's do it.

05:37.248 --> 05:39.406
Assistant Director Reade,
what a pleasant surprise.

05:39.474 --> 05:41.708
- I hope this is a friendly visit.
- Always.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.911
I appreciate you seeing me
on such short notice.

05:43.978 --> 05:45.646
Not at all.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.916
And, I see you've brought some friends.

05:49.198 --> 05:51.285
We finally finished logging
all the files you gave us,

05:51.352 --> 05:53.187
and I wanted to personally

05:53.254 --> 05:55.189
return the originals with thanks.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.892
How thoughtful.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.461
Director Weitz would have been here,

06:00.528 --> 06:03.112
but he's currently
at a meeting off-site.

06:03.184 --> 06:05.245
Is this okay right here? It's fine.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.616
- Just here?
- It's fine.

06:06.653 --> 06:08.620
It's not every day
people put themselves out

06:08.657 --> 06:11.958
- to help the FBI.
- Well, I believe in our justice system,

06:11.995 --> 06:14.385
and all the fine work you do.

06:14.422 --> 06:16.010
And we appreciate that.

06:16.073 --> 06:17.932
All right!

06:18.112 --> 06:19.893
We just need you to sign

06:19.932 --> 06:22.149
that you've received everything.

06:22.217 --> 06:24.651
Uh, just right here.

06:26.294 --> 06:28.643
Oh, and initial here and here.

06:28.792 --> 06:31.458
Our clerk gets a little
cranky if we miss those.

06:31.940 --> 06:33.301
Not on the desk.

06:33.338 --> 06:34.786
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

06:34.830 --> 06:36.682
I just was mesmerized by this tree.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.073
- Is this a Sanini?
- No, no.

06:39.204 --> 06:40.542
But it's funny, you're the...

06:40.596 --> 06:42.581
second person today to comment on it.

06:42.733 --> 06:44.267
Is that right?

06:44.718 --> 06:46.052
Okay, I think that's it.

06:46.135 --> 06:48.075
We won't be taking up
any more of your time,

06:48.142 --> 06:50.159
and thanks for havin' us.

06:51.292 --> 06:52.503
Of course.

06:52.650 --> 06:55.085
Lovely to see you, Assistant Director.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.741
Bad news.

07:03.793 --> 07:05.561
The only way outta here
is through this door.

07:05.636 --> 07:07.073
You mean the one being
guarded by that goon

07:07.110 --> 07:08.362
from Central Casting?

07:08.378 --> 07:10.167
- Lovely.
- How's this going?

07:10.245 --> 07:11.946
This isn't just any plane
we're trying to hack.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.518
The security measures Bradley Dynamics

07:13.555 --> 07:14.916
have on this thing are insane.

07:14.983 --> 07:16.033
It's taken me this whole time

07:16.084 --> 07:17.244
just to breach the first firewall.

07:17.281 --> 07:18.424
Now that we're in,

07:18.461 --> 07:20.135
Madeline will see
we're making some progress

07:20.172 --> 07:21.536
That'll buy us some time to figure out

07:21.573 --> 07:23.207
how to get word to the team.

07:27.166 --> 07:28.399
Where have you been?

07:28.612 --> 07:30.620
I found someone you might like to meet.

07:34.117 --> 07:36.245
Who are you?

07:36.477 --> 07:38.111
I'm Del Toro.

07:39.713 --> 07:41.086
If he's Del Toro,

07:41.123 --> 07:43.091
then who the hell is with Zapata?

07:56.207 --> 07:57.340
Okay...

07:58.757 --> 08:00.625
Let's start from the beginning.

08:00.926 --> 08:03.364
How did you find the real Mr. Del Toro?

08:03.788 --> 08:05.569
I smelled a rat back in Toronto,

08:05.606 --> 08:06.998
so I started digging.

08:07.035 --> 08:08.420
Zapata told me her conversation

08:08.457 --> 08:10.809
with Del Toro went well...
I didn't buy it.

08:10.895 --> 08:13.738
She was late for our meet,
so I blew her off.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.471
I don't trust people who don't
do what they say they will.

08:16.508 --> 08:17.842
Nor do I.

08:18.059 --> 08:20.611
We want to borrow
your hacker, Del Toro.

08:21.027 --> 08:22.259
Fine.

08:22.481 --> 08:24.996
- And you never told Cortez?
- I did.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.405
But you already paid him,

08:26.552 --> 08:28.254
and he wasn't hearing any complaints.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.693
Good deal for him. And for you.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.034
Nothing's free in this life,
which is why I'm here.

08:34.145 --> 08:36.340
Zapata knew we'd
never met Del Toro in person,

08:36.376 --> 08:37.722
so she got her friend to play the part,

08:37.760 --> 08:39.085
whoever the hell he is.

08:39.489 --> 08:41.366
But the question now is whether

08:41.433 --> 08:43.201
they're really trying
to hack this plane,

08:43.268 --> 08:44.635
or just wasting our time.

08:44.703 --> 08:46.463
If he's gotten
through Bradley Dynamics'

08:46.499 --> 08:48.239
first firewall, he's not nobody.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.341
That does not make me feel better.

08:50.567 --> 08:52.410
Now, you do understand
the task at hand,

08:52.478 --> 08:54.074
and you feel you're up for it?

08:54.270 --> 08:55.780
If you've got the hardware
he says you do,

08:56.098 --> 08:57.982
- it shouldn't be a problem.
- Good.

08:58.261 --> 09:01.014
Then you and I are gonna
make history today.

09:01.379 --> 09:02.546
Go to work.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.120
What do you want me to do about Zapata?

09:09.176 --> 09:10.256
Bring her in.

09:10.293 --> 09:12.787
At best, she used an impostor
to hide her mistake.

09:12.824 --> 09:14.311
At worst, she's law enforcement.

09:14.348 --> 09:16.967
Either way she's a liar,
but I need to know what kind

09:17.004 --> 09:18.803
before I can decide
what to do with her.

09:19.137 --> 09:20.644
And her hacker friend?

09:20.730 --> 09:22.206
Kill him.

09:29.114 --> 09:30.381
All right, don't judge,

09:30.449 --> 09:32.527
it was pretty slim pickings
at the rest stop.

09:32.601 --> 09:33.670
And what do we got?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.420
Well, I got tofu jerky.

09:35.487 --> 09:36.824
- Nope.
- Yeah.

09:36.887 --> 09:38.923
And then I got some dark chocolate

09:38.991 --> 09:40.553
in the shape of bunnies,

09:40.590 --> 09:42.493
which I'm pretty sure
is left over from Easter.

09:42.561 --> 09:43.762
- Eh.
- Mm.

09:43.799 --> 09:46.637
And then I got some spicy
chicken-flavored chips,

09:46.685 --> 09:48.592
- Nice.
- Although, there's no chicken

09:48.629 --> 09:50.459
or potatoes in the ingredients list,

09:50.496 --> 09:51.769
which is a little concerning.

09:51.806 --> 09:54.332
Well, I'll take my chances with
the chocolate bunnies. Okay.

09:55.699 --> 09:56.774
Whoa, what was that?

09:56.842 --> 09:58.276
Pretty sure it's a flat tire.

10:09.867 --> 10:11.601
Yeah...

10:12.059 --> 10:13.826
We've definitely run over something.

10:14.028 --> 10:16.296
I'll get the spare.

10:20.628 --> 10:22.028
Or not.

10:23.711 --> 10:25.082
Great.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.902
- I'll get the tow truck.
- Okay.

10:32.387 --> 10:34.012
Or not.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.228
No service. You?

10:36.381 --> 10:37.548
Nothing.

10:39.676 --> 10:40.896
What kind of rental car doesn't have

10:40.933 --> 10:42.186
a spare tire in the trunk?

10:42.254 --> 10:43.902
Hey, this is gonna be fine.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.891
The point was to be together,
and we are.

10:47.223 --> 10:49.480
The point was,
you're supposed to relax.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.542
Anyway, you know what? Stay here.

10:52.664 --> 10:54.308
I'll keep walking until I get a signal.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.428
No, no, no.

10:55.465 --> 10:56.598
I'll go with you.

10:56.660 --> 10:59.480
The cabin's only five miles away.

10:59.574 --> 11:00.972
- Yeah.
- If we don't get any service,

11:01.039 --> 11:03.140
we'll just call from
the landline when we get there.

11:03.738 --> 11:05.131
- Sure you're up for it?
- Yeah.

11:05.168 --> 11:08.232
I've never felt better.
Besides, when do we ever

11:08.269 --> 11:10.793
get to take a nice long
walk in the woods.

11:11.535 --> 11:12.802
Okay.

11:12.894 --> 11:14.933
Can you bring the bunnies,
though, for some snacks?

11:15.043 --> 11:18.145
Not your tofu jerky stuff.

11:20.536 --> 11:22.170
Find anything on the sniffer?

11:22.262 --> 11:24.527
Oh, there is a literal gold
mine of data on this thing.

11:24.652 --> 11:27.568
Uh, technically a figurative
gold mine of data.

11:27.605 --> 11:29.445
Well, technically you can zip
your lip, how about that?

11:29.481 --> 11:31.201
- All right, what you got, what you got?
- Whoa, whoa.

11:31.348 --> 11:32.937
Documents from Bradley Dynamics

11:33.005 --> 11:34.959
showing their aeronautics system,

11:34.996 --> 11:37.775
code named ARVO,
failed major safety tests.

11:38.371 --> 11:40.451
Madeline Burke has plans
to exploit ARVO

11:40.488 --> 11:41.894
to take down a commercial airplane.

11:42.129 --> 11:44.223
That's the program that Zapata
said Madeline was targeting.

11:44.348 --> 11:46.108
They must have fixed them
before they went to market.

11:46.144 --> 11:48.020
Not exactly. We also found this.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.545
An internal Bradley Dynamics memo

11:50.582 --> 11:51.943
saying that they were
aware of the flaws

11:51.980 --> 11:54.504
and told employees
to falsify test results

11:54.590 --> 11:56.551
so they wouldn't lose
the jumbo-liner contract.

11:56.588 --> 11:58.256
These must be the documents
Zapata leveraged

11:58.293 --> 11:59.494
the Bradley Dynamics engineer for.

11:59.925 --> 12:01.925
- What do you want?
- Every document your company

12:01.962 --> 12:03.501
has on Project ARVO.

12:04.035 --> 12:06.123
So, Madeline knows Bradley
is trying to cover up

12:06.160 --> 12:07.637
safety flaws in their system.

12:07.707 --> 12:09.967
HCI Global has a huge
aeronautics division.

12:10.004 --> 12:11.207
If these memos leak, it would take

12:11.244 --> 12:12.924
one of their biggest
competitors out of business.

12:12.961 --> 12:14.058
Allowing her to swoop in

12:14.095 --> 12:15.862
and nab a very lucrative contract.

12:15.929 --> 12:17.473
All right, let's bring in
this Garret Young,

12:17.510 --> 12:18.824
head of safety at Bradley.

12:18.861 --> 12:20.421
Maybe he can tell us
why he shouldn't be sitting

12:20.458 --> 12:22.160
in a jail cell right now.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.271
So, we save the day,

12:27.308 --> 12:29.209
and it's so long, house arrest.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.035
Back to the life of the bon vivant

12:31.072 --> 12:32.134
I was meant for.

12:32.201 --> 12:33.702
Whatever keeps you motivated.

12:33.884 --> 12:35.217
What about you?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.854
It's your big chance to
finally prove to the team

12:36.922 --> 12:38.763
that you're not just
Madeline's traitorous little...

12:38.799 --> 12:40.284
Easy.

12:43.079 --> 12:44.479
I'm still gonna have
to answer for the way

12:44.516 --> 12:45.720
I handled this op.

12:45.757 --> 12:47.491
If they do let you back in,

12:47.528 --> 12:49.195
could you put in a good word for me?

12:49.419 --> 12:50.649
Yeah, I think I'm in the running

12:50.686 --> 12:51.920
for a consulting gig.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.618
You really want to work with your ex?

12:53.655 --> 12:56.180
Oh, hell no. I wanna replace him.

12:57.509 --> 12:59.227
Huh...

13:00.530 --> 13:02.197
- That's weird.
- What?

13:02.265 --> 13:03.860
There's a glitch.

13:03.923 --> 13:05.274
It sometimes happens when you do

13:05.311 --> 13:06.993
a "man in the middle" attack.

13:07.102 --> 13:09.415
Someone is spoofing the SSL

13:09.454 --> 13:11.563
for all traffic that passes
through this network.

13:11.882 --> 13:13.392
Madeline is limiting

13:13.429 --> 13:14.859
the information that's passing through.

13:14.905 --> 13:16.555
Yeah, but if she told us
to hack this plane,

13:16.592 --> 13:18.048
why would she...

13:19.102 --> 13:21.266
She knows we're not on her side.

13:21.803 --> 13:24.024
We gotta go. Now.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.687
He's coming in.

13:48.272 --> 13:49.494
Uhh!

13:51.249 --> 13:53.081
Really?

13:53.149 --> 13:54.585
So, I watch professional wrestling.

13:54.622 --> 13:55.999
You try being under house arrest.

13:56.074 --> 13:57.942
Plus, it's like gay "Fantasia," so...

13:58.210 --> 14:00.219
<i>Wilson, come in. You got 'em?</i>

14:00.419 --> 14:02.086
<i>Burke wants the chick brought in.</i>

14:02.123 --> 14:03.290
<i>You can get rid of the nerd.</i>

14:03.350 --> 14:05.030
What is this, high school?

14:05.108 --> 14:06.328
What are you doing?

14:06.396 --> 14:07.795
Uh, yeah, this is Wilson.

14:07.832 --> 14:10.866
I got the broad.
The computer whiz is dead.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.022
Uh, he was stronger than you think.

14:13.059 --> 14:14.217
Okay, over.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.787
Hey, it's worth a shot.

14:18.585 --> 14:20.219
This is Garret Young,

14:20.256 --> 14:22.045
head of safety at Bradley Dynamics.

14:22.116 --> 14:23.712
I'm Assistant Director Reade.

14:23.749 --> 14:24.983
We've come across

14:25.020 --> 14:26.531
some internal memos from your company.

14:26.568 --> 14:28.769
Can you tell us if you
recognize any of these?

14:29.617 --> 14:31.017
I've never seen them before.

14:31.062 --> 14:33.463
Really?
Your signature is on all of them,

14:33.656 --> 14:35.962
including some showing that your system

14:35.999 --> 14:37.219
failed major safety tests.

14:37.256 --> 14:38.727
There's also this really fun one

14:38.795 --> 14:40.475
where you're instructing
all your division heads

14:40.511 --> 14:42.012
to cover it up.

14:45.001 --> 14:46.243
W-Where did you get these?

14:46.280 --> 14:47.569
An inside source.

14:47.606 --> 14:49.967
Well, your source
gave you bogus paperwork.

14:50.045 --> 14:51.740
These documents have been falsified.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.575
ARVO passed all of its safety tests.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.178
There are no flaws in our system.

14:55.215 --> 14:56.350
Why should we believe you?

14:56.387 --> 14:58.525
I personally flew on the plane
during the testing phase.

14:58.562 --> 15:00.282
Why would I do that if
I thought there were concerns?

15:00.599 --> 15:02.078
And if I did, why would
I sign a document

15:02.115 --> 15:03.288
covering it up?

15:03.325 --> 15:05.501
I have records of every test we ran,

15:05.538 --> 15:06.798
and the FAA officials,

15:06.835 --> 15:09.057
and independent safety experts
who witnessed them.

15:09.202 --> 15:11.426
Those are some
pretty good reasons, actually.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.662
- Well, if that's true...
- This is all Madeline.

15:13.835 --> 15:15.305
She created the false test results

15:15.342 --> 15:16.698
and the false memo covering it up

15:16.766 --> 15:18.500
to discredit Bradley Dynamics
and win the bid.

15:18.568 --> 15:20.530
Yeah, but these documents
aren't enough alone.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.149
Like, she has to cause
an actual accident

15:22.186 --> 15:23.780
in order to take... down the company.

15:23.817 --> 15:25.718
That's why she wants
Del Toro to crash the plane.

15:25.755 --> 15:27.355
Because when it goes down,
she leaks these memos

15:27.392 --> 15:28.758
and Bradley Dynamics is toast.

15:28.826 --> 15:30.667
Excuse me, someone is trying
to crash one of our planes?

15:30.703 --> 15:32.595
Patterson, get the FAA
on the line immediately,

15:32.632 --> 15:33.936
we shut down every single jumbo-liner

15:33.973 --> 15:35.334
- from Bradley Dynamics.
- Hang on!

15:35.402 --> 15:36.819
Wait, you don't need to do that.

15:36.856 --> 15:38.404
- Why not?
- I can't legally say

15:38.441 --> 15:40.281
- until I talk to someone...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Garret.

15:40.328 --> 15:41.757
If you have intel
that could save lives,

15:41.794 --> 15:43.077
you need to tell us.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.842
Project ARVO isn't about all
Bradley Dynamics jumbo-liners.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.947
It is about one in particular.

15:50.197 --> 15:53.428
ARVO is only installed
in the new Air Force One.

15:55.424 --> 15:56.975
Where's Air Force One right now?

15:57.012 --> 15:58.379
It's in the air.

15:58.756 --> 16:00.881
It's a positioning flight
so it could be in DC

16:00.918 --> 16:02.827
tomorrow for its official
maiden voyage.

16:02.999 --> 16:04.900
Stay here.

16:11.702 --> 16:13.585
Hey, cheer up.

16:13.679 --> 16:16.614
We're out in nature,
not a soul in sight.

16:16.983 --> 16:19.592
Kinda reminds me
of our time in Colorado.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.014
Reminds me of the start
of every horror film.

16:22.051 --> 16:23.264
Oh, yeah.

16:23.301 --> 16:25.264
Car breaks down
on the side of the road,

16:25.313 --> 16:26.847
no cell reception,

16:26.884 --> 16:29.327
and then we have to walk
to the cabin in the woods.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.100
Shush. I'm getting scared.

16:32.999 --> 16:34.467
Then the zombies start showing up.

16:34.534 --> 16:36.235
Well, my brain's been
through a lot lately.

16:36.303 --> 16:37.592
Not sure they'd want it.

16:39.108 --> 16:42.233
Speaking of zombies, I'm starving.

16:42.287 --> 16:43.866
Well, I'm not sure ordering in

16:43.903 --> 16:45.671
is really an option around here.

16:45.944 --> 16:48.381
The owner of the cabin
stocked up the fridge for us.

16:48.466 --> 16:49.666
- Mm!
- Yeah.

16:49.703 --> 16:53.372
So, when we get there,
I'll cook us up something.

16:53.788 --> 16:56.288
You can have a nice,
warm, relaxing bath.

16:56.467 --> 16:57.991
Mm, that sounds so nice.

16:58.028 --> 16:59.178
Yeah, it does.

16:59.215 --> 17:00.649
You know what, I... I was thinking.

17:00.772 --> 17:03.173
- Mm-hmm?
- Maybe we can light

17:03.210 --> 17:05.297
a candle at dinner tonight for Roman.

17:05.849 --> 17:09.602
Yeah, uh... of course we can.

17:09.991 --> 17:12.003
I mean, despite all
the terrible things he did,

17:12.071 --> 17:14.138
I'm still here because of him.

17:14.723 --> 17:16.858
The data caches, the stem cells.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.571
I mean...

17:19.746 --> 17:22.381
I'm alive because of Roman.

17:24.454 --> 17:26.423
Yeah. You are.

17:28.555 --> 17:30.256
Thank you.

17:32.037 --> 17:33.771
Hey, look at that.

17:34.027 --> 17:35.828
465 Sheridan Road.

17:35.896 --> 17:37.163
Ohh, perfect!

17:40.626 --> 17:41.893
Whoa.

17:42.446 --> 17:44.113
Somebody's in trouble.

17:49.817 --> 17:51.685
Special Agent Weller, Agent Doe,

17:51.722 --> 17:54.423
you're needed back in the city,
we have a situation.

17:55.354 --> 17:57.263
- So close.
- And yet, so far.

18:03.056 --> 18:04.390
Is the president on the plane?

18:04.458 --> 18:06.158
No, but other people are.
You know, technically,

18:06.226 --> 18:07.890
it's not actually called
Air Force One right now.

18:07.927 --> 18:09.773
It's only called that when
the president's on board.

18:09.810 --> 18:11.570
Otherwise, it's just
referred to by its tail number.

18:11.606 --> 18:13.466
- Not the time for trivia, Rich.
- Touché.

18:13.533 --> 18:15.534
The plane's on its way to DC
for its maiden voyage.

18:15.602 --> 18:18.091
They have a scheduled ribbon-cutting
ceremony tomorrow morning.

18:18.201 --> 18:19.890
Okay, according to the manifest,

18:19.967 --> 18:23.773
there are 52 passengers...
or, sorry, make that 53.

18:23.810 --> 18:24.877
There was a late add.

18:24.945 --> 18:26.812
Most are government personnel,

18:26.849 --> 18:28.779
a few journalists, and crew members.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.601
Okay, so the good news here
is that Madeline

18:30.638 --> 18:32.851
has Zapata and Boston, who she thinks

18:32.888 --> 18:34.220
is Del Toro, doing the hacking.

18:34.257 --> 18:36.615
So, they're not gonna
actually sabotage any plane.

18:36.652 --> 18:38.553
Unless she figures out
that Boston isn't Del Toro.

18:38.687 --> 18:40.021
If she hasn't already.

18:40.105 --> 18:41.851
And if she does, she's just gonna find

18:41.888 --> 18:43.062
someone else to do the job.

18:43.099 --> 18:45.622
We haven't heard from Zapata
and Boston since they went in.

18:45.701 --> 18:47.685
How much longer is the plane
supposed to be in the air?

18:47.755 --> 18:49.787
- Less than an hour.
- Can we force an emergency landing?

18:49.833 --> 18:51.473
Well, we have Bradley's
head of security working

18:51.509 --> 18:53.443
with Secret Service to see
if that's a viable option.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.289
The problem is,
if Madeline tracks them,

18:55.326 --> 18:56.664
and we try to land the plane early...

18:56.701 --> 18:58.335
Got it, right.
So, I'll check in with him,

18:58.372 --> 18:59.546
see if he's got any updates.

18:59.583 --> 19:00.863
All right, I'll try to track down Weitz

19:00.899 --> 19:02.400
to see if I can loop him in.

19:05.615 --> 19:08.093
Thanks again for
working around my schedule.

19:08.130 --> 19:10.435
Sorry I had to change the time
and place so last minute.

19:10.537 --> 19:12.445
Oh, you're the senior advisor
to the president.

19:12.482 --> 19:14.216
Your schedule beats my schedule.

19:15.474 --> 19:18.335
I realize I haven't
really spoken with you

19:18.372 --> 19:20.266
since you became FBI Director.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.201
You've been making some
remarkable moves lately.

19:22.269 --> 19:24.169
Well, I've been very fortunate.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.380
That's not how I would describe you.

19:26.669 --> 19:29.141
I know how hard you've worked
to get to where you are.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.849
Thank you, but it's...
it's really a team effort.

19:30.885 --> 19:34.213
You're a political animal...
clever, cunning,

19:34.281 --> 19:36.015
willing to do whatever
it takes to get what you want.

19:36.082 --> 19:38.117
Oh, yeah, I... I think
we're drifting a bit

19:38.154 --> 19:40.232
from complimentary
territory here, but, uh...

19:40.294 --> 19:42.359
I hope you realize
how perfectly primed you are

19:42.396 --> 19:44.062
for a job in the private sector.

19:44.106 --> 19:46.333
- With your credentials...
- That's very kind of you, Stephanie,

19:46.377 --> 19:49.458
but private sector's not
calling to me right now.

19:49.495 --> 19:50.857
I'm focused on the job that I have

19:50.894 --> 19:52.228
and doing that well.

19:52.265 --> 19:54.218
There's a lot... a lot
of crime out there

19:54.255 --> 19:56.635
and a lot of corruption
that needs to be cleaned up.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.570
Well, you could run
a private security firm

19:59.607 --> 20:01.552
or work for a defense contractor.

20:01.646 --> 20:04.351
It's all the prestige and power
of what you're doing now,

20:04.388 --> 20:05.935
but with private sector money.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.085
With all due respect,
I'd like to see how high

20:08.122 --> 20:09.515
my political ladder goes.

20:10.450 --> 20:13.228
This is as high as it goes, Matthew.

20:13.974 --> 20:15.421
I'm sorry?

20:15.458 --> 20:17.690
Did... are you... did...

20:18.115 --> 20:20.159
Did you call this meeting
to push me out?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.828
I called this meeting to let
you know where you stand.

20:23.239 --> 20:24.919
And where exactly is that?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.567
I think there's an exit down there.

20:28.635 --> 20:29.734
Let's hope so.

20:29.771 --> 20:30.971
This gun only has one bullet left.

20:32.184 --> 20:33.579
It's locked.

20:46.424 --> 20:47.658
What are you doing?

20:47.718 --> 20:49.318
We gotta go.

20:51.759 --> 20:54.093
What? What is it?

20:54.463 --> 20:56.720
Explosives. C4.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.838
Wired through the entire
building, it looks like.

21:02.314 --> 21:04.720
She's gonna blow up
the entire building?

21:04.938 --> 21:06.305
Overkill much.

21:06.713 --> 21:08.517
Madeline doesn't leave
anything to chance.

21:08.822 --> 21:10.502
She destroys this place,
she doesn't have to worry

21:10.538 --> 21:12.090
about the servers...

21:12.371 --> 21:13.671
or us.

21:17.096 --> 21:18.630
Del Toro's making progress.

21:18.767 --> 21:21.120
Plane should be down
in less than 20 minutes.

21:21.187 --> 21:22.416
Good.

21:22.470 --> 21:24.681
Zapata's little ruse cost us time.

21:24.876 --> 21:26.877
You know, I trusted her.

21:27.185 --> 21:28.419
I knew she was smart,

21:28.456 --> 21:30.023
but I thought she was damaged enough

21:30.075 --> 21:31.909
to live in the gray.

21:33.767 --> 21:34.967
She played me.

21:35.035 --> 21:37.503
- She's good at what she does.
- Not good enough.

21:37.570 --> 21:40.406
When that plane is down,
blow the building.

21:40.767 --> 21:44.843
Whatever Zapata is or isn't,
she's about to be dust.

21:47.244 --> 21:48.781
I spoke to my security team at Bradley.

21:48.848 --> 21:50.783
The hackers blocked
all signals to Air Force One.

21:50.850 --> 21:52.908
No one can communicate with
the plane from the ground,

21:52.970 --> 21:54.603
not even air traffic control.

21:54.642 --> 21:56.085
So, that was the Secret Service.

21:56.122 --> 21:58.658
They just confirmed they're
locked out of the system as well,

21:58.720 --> 22:00.894
which means they can't force
an emergency landing.

22:00.931 --> 22:02.531
I've been going through
the list of passengers,

22:02.567 --> 22:04.173
we've tried calling, sending texts.

22:04.283 --> 22:05.883
It seems like their phones
have been turned off.

22:05.919 --> 22:07.605
So, we have no way
of telling the captain

22:07.642 --> 22:08.893
that the plane is under attack?

22:08.930 --> 22:11.532
There is no way that Boston
hacked this plane for real.

22:11.569 --> 22:13.582
He hacked NORAD for real. Excuse me?

22:13.619 --> 22:14.859
I'm pretty sure that was under duress

22:14.895 --> 22:16.175
and false pretenses, if you recall.

22:16.242 --> 22:17.409
I think Rich is right.

22:17.477 --> 22:19.340
Boston is still
with Zapata, presumably,

22:19.377 --> 22:21.213
and their job was to counter-hack.

22:21.793 --> 22:23.160
Wait, do you think Madeline

22:23.197 --> 22:24.892
is forcing them to do it at gunpoint?

22:24.978 --> 22:27.019
I don't know, I just don't like
that they haven't checked in,

22:27.056 --> 22:28.554
and we have no way of tracking them.

22:28.861 --> 22:31.421
Patterson, send a team
to Madeline's office.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.058
All right, it's time to bring her in.

22:33.189 --> 22:34.593
Rich, work with Garret,

22:34.869 --> 22:36.549
try to figure out a way
to get through to this plane.

22:36.705 --> 22:38.406
Yeah, let's keep trying Weitz.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.822
You called this meeting
just to fire me?

22:43.892 --> 22:45.861
After everything I've done
for this administration?

22:45.916 --> 22:48.736
We've known each other
a very long time, Matthew.

22:48.814 --> 22:51.143
I'm trying to give you
an exit strategy.

22:51.306 --> 22:53.178
No, okay, hold... hold on a second.

22:53.816 --> 22:55.850
What did I do wrong?

22:56.389 --> 22:57.623
Let me rephrase.

22:57.697 --> 22:59.651
I know I did some things
that are a bit...

22:59.719 --> 23:01.553
Illegal? Amoral?

23:01.621 --> 23:03.021
I was gonna say nebulous.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.543
We get into things with
the best of intentions,

23:05.580 --> 23:07.626
and sometimes they go sideways.

23:07.694 --> 23:08.933
Like GPA.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.361
Yeah...

23:10.398 --> 23:12.267
I knew that was gonna be the
one to come back and bite me.

23:12.304 --> 23:14.745
One congressman dead, another shot,

23:14.782 --> 23:17.665
two of my own staff members
taken down in the scandal.

23:17.751 --> 23:21.240
Indictments, investigations,
corrupt ties to China.

23:21.307 --> 23:23.065
Not to mention that GPA

23:23.102 --> 23:25.126
is one of the president's
largest donors.

23:25.209 --> 23:26.542
I wanna speak to your boss.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.298
No offense, but I wanna
speak to your boss.

23:28.376 --> 23:29.982
There is no move to make here, Matthew.

23:30.134 --> 23:31.668
It's over.

23:32.932 --> 23:34.199
Hey, any luck with Weitz?

23:34.313 --> 23:36.047
Nope, all of his calls
go straight to voicemail.

23:36.376 --> 23:38.543
His office said he was supposed to
be out of a meeting an hour ago.

23:38.580 --> 23:39.893
I've been trying to ping his phone,

23:39.930 --> 23:41.805
but it keeps bouncing from
cell tower to cell tower.

23:42.158 --> 23:44.292
Wait a minute, who was he meeting with?

23:46.005 --> 23:47.238
Um...

23:47.782 --> 23:50.829
Uh, the president's senior advisor.

23:51.171 --> 23:52.790
Oh, no...

23:53.696 --> 23:55.140
Where was the meeting?

23:55.446 --> 23:56.809
So, what happens now?

23:57.235 --> 23:59.472
You'll make the announcement
that you're stepping down

23:59.509 --> 24:01.280
right when we land.

24:01.422 --> 24:03.827
Thanks again for flying with me.

24:05.032 --> 24:07.166
And sorry, but you're
gonna have to find

24:07.203 --> 24:09.405
your own way back to New York.

24:25.728 --> 24:27.063
Go for Weitz. What?

24:27.100 --> 24:28.454
I'm not even supposed
to have this stupid thing on.

24:28.462 --> 24:30.089
<i>Weitz, we have very bad news.</i>

24:30.126 --> 24:31.378
Yeah, well, it can't be worse

24:31.446 --> 24:32.720
than the news I just got.

24:32.751 --> 24:34.311
By the way, don't tell me
anything classified,

24:34.456 --> 24:36.704
'cause I'm no longer
the director of the FBI.

24:37.446 --> 24:39.259
Air Force One is being hacked.

24:39.329 --> 24:41.610
What? What do you mean?
I'm on Air Force One.

24:41.665 --> 24:43.073
<i>We know, that's why we called you.</i>

24:43.110 --> 24:44.796
We need you to help us
or you're gonna crash.

24:45.871 --> 24:48.634
Okay. That's worse.

24:53.621 --> 24:55.188
Look over there.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.151
What are you doing?
The exit's that way.

25:01.188 --> 25:02.468
We're trying to get out of the building

25:02.504 --> 25:03.789
full of explosives, remember?

25:03.876 --> 25:05.112
Just because Madeline froze us out,

25:05.149 --> 25:06.949
doesn't mean she's not still
gonna down the airliner.

25:07.579 --> 25:09.387
If she's doing
anything in this building,

25:09.674 --> 25:11.174
we have to stop it.

25:12.039 --> 25:13.370
Think about it.

25:13.407 --> 25:15.360
Why hasn't she blown this place up yet?

25:15.990 --> 25:18.141
Did you say you wanna
work with the FBI?

25:19.904 --> 25:22.239
That is extremely manipulative.

25:23.287 --> 25:25.555
And I respect that.

25:28.868 --> 25:31.266
Looks like he has the flight
controls on his screen.

25:31.337 --> 25:33.282
We have to stop him
before he crashes it.

25:33.384 --> 25:34.923
How do you suggest we do that?

25:34.983 --> 25:37.451
We only have one bullet left, remember?

25:41.165 --> 25:43.388
Stephanie... I'm on
the line with my team.

25:43.641 --> 25:44.727
You don't have a team.

25:44.766 --> 25:46.324
Well, this is a serious situation.

25:46.673 --> 25:48.501
Why is your phone even on?

25:48.579 --> 25:49.868
It's like you're allergic to rules.

25:49.905 --> 25:51.185
- What part of...
- The plane is hacked.

25:51.221 --> 25:53.048
- We are gonna crash.
- What?

25:53.085 --> 25:55.119
You need to get me
in the cockpit right now.

25:55.156 --> 25:56.723
The Secret Service won't
open the door for me.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.284
If this is some sort of desperate ploy

25:58.321 --> 26:00.493
- to get your job back, it's...
- Hey, hey!

26:00.581 --> 26:02.949
We are running out of time.

26:04.805 --> 26:06.038
- Okay.
- So, you need to get

26:06.075 --> 26:07.399
the colonel to open up her door.

26:07.450 --> 26:09.284
She doesn't realize she's being hacked.

26:09.352 --> 26:12.020
She has to talk to my team
so they can get us to safety.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.704
Okay, we're on with the pilot.

26:16.321 --> 26:17.743
This is Colonel Hecker speaking.

26:17.780 --> 26:19.213
<i>Colonel Hecker,
this is Special Agent Weller</i>

26:19.249 --> 26:20.570
from the New York office of the FBI.

26:20.688 --> 26:22.378
Your plane is currently being hacked.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.743
Heh. Due respect,
but I think you're mistaken.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.261
I've got full control of my aircraft.

26:26.298 --> 26:27.634
Your comms have been shut down.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.087
<i>We've been trying
to communicate with you</i>

26:29.124 --> 26:31.259
<i>as well as the Secret Service and ATC.</i>

26:31.302 --> 26:33.315
<i>Ma'am, this is Garret Young
of Bradley Dynamics.</i>

26:33.352 --> 26:34.919
I need you to disengage autopilot

26:34.971 --> 26:36.405
and try banking left or right.

26:39.837 --> 26:40.962
What the hell?

26:40.999 --> 26:43.074
- Can you control the aircraft?
<i>- Negative.</i>

26:43.111 --> 26:44.470
The yoke appears to be stuck.

26:44.507 --> 26:46.276
- Can you change your altitude?
- <i>Negative.</i>

26:46.313 --> 26:48.081
Maintaining at 37,000 feet.

26:48.118 --> 26:49.563
I'm sorry, how many of you are there?

26:49.601 --> 26:50.938
<i>Can I just speak with one person?</i>

26:50.975 --> 26:53.076
This is Garret Young again.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.540
We're gonna need you
to reboot the system.

26:55.634 --> 26:57.702
Copy. Powering down now.

26:57.785 --> 26:59.686
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:59.745 --> 27:01.173
this is Colonel Hecker speaking.

27:01.218 --> 27:02.738
We're gonna need you
to fasten your seatbelts

27:02.774 --> 27:04.648
while we do a quick
reboot of the system.

27:04.696 --> 27:06.188
You may experience a brief interruption

27:06.225 --> 27:07.564
in the cabin's power.

27:07.616 --> 27:09.688
Nothing to be alarmed about.

27:09.813 --> 27:11.251
The whole plane's about to shut down.

27:11.288 --> 27:12.770
What do you want me to say?

27:29.391 --> 27:31.614
Nice try.

27:34.626 --> 27:37.120
All right, Colonel,
you can power up again.

27:45.043 --> 27:47.912
Okay... all systems
seem to be restored.

27:48.198 --> 27:49.732
<i>Well done, ma'am.</i>

27:49.769 --> 27:51.703
Please confirm you have
manual control now.

27:51.740 --> 27:53.307
<i>Alert. Alert.</i>

27:53.344 --> 27:54.790
<i>Colonel, what's happening?</i>

27:54.827 --> 27:56.282
The plane's depressurizing!

27:56.319 --> 27:58.739
That's bad, right?
Patterson, do your thing!

27:58.776 --> 28:00.576
<i>Do your thing!
Do your thing and your stuff!</i>

28:00.644 --> 28:02.311
<i>The oxygen masks aren't deploying!</i>

28:02.379 --> 28:03.805
We're losing cabin pressure!

28:03.842 --> 28:05.114
What the hell do we do!

28:09.283 --> 28:10.665
Colonel?

28:13.290 --> 28:14.557
<i>Colonel?</i>

28:14.766 --> 28:15.899
Weitz!

28:17.628 --> 28:19.384
<i>Colonel Hecker!</i>

28:19.532 --> 28:20.799
<i>Weitz!</i>

28:24.462 --> 28:26.235
She said the cabin was depressurizing.

28:26.303 --> 28:27.860
They must have lost consciousness.

28:27.912 --> 28:29.713
So, why wouldn't
the oxygen masks have deployed?

28:29.773 --> 28:31.040
Del Toro must have disabled them.

28:31.098 --> 28:32.508
There's no way this is Boston.

28:32.545 --> 28:33.779
Patterson, how long we got

28:33.823 --> 28:35.490
until we lose everyone on that plane?

28:35.527 --> 28:36.627
Move.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.308
We've got 10 minutes till impact.

28:38.345 --> 28:39.837
We have to restore oxygen.

28:39.874 --> 28:41.584
How is the hacker doing this?

28:41.652 --> 28:42.952
Garret, what are the access points

28:43.020 --> 28:44.391
from the ground to Air Force One?

28:44.428 --> 28:45.822
None. ARVO was designed

28:45.859 --> 28:47.393
to be 100% self-sufficient.

28:47.430 --> 28:48.955
That was one of the selling
points of the project.

28:48.991 --> 28:50.293
Well, obviously, that's not the case

28:50.330 --> 28:51.930
if someone is hacking it
from the ground.

28:51.967 --> 28:54.118
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a test flight, right?

28:54.264 --> 28:55.765
Are you still running those tests?

28:55.833 --> 28:58.026
Yeah, we've got
analytic servers in place

28:58.063 --> 29:00.157
to send data back and forth
during the first month of service.

29:00.194 --> 29:01.714
The hacker must have
commandeered one of 'em.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.087
Use the server as a back door

29:03.124 --> 29:04.605
to get malware on the plane
and gain control.

29:04.641 --> 29:06.157
I mean, that's how I would do it.

29:06.243 --> 29:08.211
If that's true, the only way
we can get control back

29:08.278 --> 29:09.743
is by cutting off
the server completely.

29:09.780 --> 29:11.114
Okay, so let's do it.

29:18.276 --> 29:19.776
Ahem!

29:20.942 --> 29:23.227
I-I-I wouldn't do that. No, stop.

29:23.563 --> 29:25.328
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

29:25.751 --> 29:27.509
No, you see, y-you shoot me,

29:27.641 --> 29:30.610
and then I let go
of this little button.

29:30.964 --> 29:35.477
And then I blow up,
and then we are all goo.

29:42.431 --> 29:44.465
Restore control back to the plane...

29:44.993 --> 29:46.704
and back away, now!

29:46.805 --> 29:48.503
Go to hell. I'll see you there.

29:49.126 --> 29:50.438
Huh?

29:50.506 --> 29:51.572
Uhh!

29:51.743 --> 29:53.040
- Hyah!
- Huh!

29:57.235 --> 29:58.430
Hyah!

30:00.616 --> 30:02.316
Uhh!

30:02.907 --> 30:05.063
Ah, peas and rice!

30:05.165 --> 30:06.573
I've never been happier to be holding

30:06.610 --> 30:08.048
a fake dead man's switch.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.110
How far did he get?

30:10.282 --> 30:12.659
Uh, it looks like he cut off
communication with the plane

30:12.696 --> 30:14.562
and depressurized the cabin
about three minutes ago.

30:15.227 --> 30:16.735
- Oh, no...
- What?

30:16.775 --> 30:19.220
The plane is set
to crash into downtown DC.

30:19.257 --> 30:20.423
Well, undo it!

30:20.460 --> 30:21.827
What do you think I'm trying to do?

30:22.083 --> 30:23.298
Team just called from HCI Global.

30:23.335 --> 30:24.432
Madeline's in the wind.

30:24.483 --> 30:25.750
Where are we at with this plane?

30:25.818 --> 30:27.285
I think I isolated the analytic server

30:27.322 --> 30:28.489
the hacker's using.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.329
So, all we need to do is shut it down

30:30.366 --> 30:32.167
using your Bradley Dynamics
credentials.

30:33.468 --> 30:34.902
No... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:34.977 --> 30:36.125
What's happening?

30:36.162 --> 30:37.970
The hacker's locked out
authorized users.

30:38.016 --> 30:39.595
So, that's it? It's over?

30:39.634 --> 30:41.634
Um, what about unauthorized users?

30:41.671 --> 30:43.071
Excuse me.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.766
Done.

30:46.837 --> 30:48.272
What? How'd you do that?

30:48.340 --> 30:50.220
I can't really... you know,
it's hacker code, I gotta...

30:50.256 --> 30:51.744
So, we've cut off the hacker's access?

30:51.842 --> 30:53.376
Yep, looks like it.

30:53.555 --> 30:54.774
Ah.

30:56.852 --> 31:00.173
No... no, no, no, no!
I just got shut out.

31:00.251 --> 31:01.571
What do you mean, you got shut out?

31:01.608 --> 31:04.167
I was literally a keystroke away
from undoing the hacking,

31:04.204 --> 31:05.493
and then I got kicked off the server.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.297
This can't be a coincidence...
somebody figured out

31:07.334 --> 31:09.048
which server was being hacked
and shut it down.

31:09.085 --> 31:10.719
Maybe somebody from Bradley Dynamics?

31:10.908 --> 31:12.842
More like someone named Rich.

31:13.098 --> 31:14.565
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.167
I am very familiar with his methods

31:16.235 --> 31:17.802
of unauthorized access.

31:18.048 --> 31:19.937
- Very familiar.
- What do we do?

31:20.005 --> 31:21.792
The team thinks they
just stopped Del Toro.

31:21.829 --> 31:23.990
They got no idea that they're
working against their own side now.

31:24.026 --> 31:25.486
Well, we need to get
in touch with Rich...

31:25.523 --> 31:26.580
- Yeah.
- ...and get him to turn

31:26.617 --> 31:27.844
that server back on.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.362
There's no service.

31:40.626 --> 31:42.193
You go outside and make the call.

31:42.261 --> 31:44.428
No. No, no, no. You go, I'll stay.

31:44.496 --> 31:46.336
You just said you were a
keystroke away from undoing it.

31:46.398 --> 31:47.703
How hard is it to press "enter"

31:47.740 --> 31:49.818
when the comms come back?

31:53.342 --> 31:55.162
Madeline's plan just went south.

31:55.240 --> 31:58.139
She's one second away from
blowing up this whole building.

31:58.443 --> 32:00.818
You still have somebody
out there that cares about you.

32:00.979 --> 32:02.713
So do you.

32:02.912 --> 32:04.117
I... I mean, probably.

32:04.154 --> 32:05.550
Let's not make this a therapy session.

32:05.617 --> 32:07.485
Just... go.

32:07.553 --> 32:09.126
Please.

32:11.161 --> 32:12.828
And, Boston...

32:14.560 --> 32:16.694
If something happens, tell Reade...

32:18.379 --> 32:19.740
I will.

32:23.931 --> 32:25.365
That was the Secret Service.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.968
They still don't have
comms with the plane.

32:27.005 --> 32:28.350
Great, that makes all of us.

32:28.387 --> 32:30.955
From what we know, they still
haven't restored cabin pressure yet.

32:31.460 --> 32:33.432
Oh, my God... the plane's trajectory

32:33.469 --> 32:35.069
is headed straight for downtown DC.

32:35.106 --> 32:37.008
What? The plane should have reset

32:37.045 --> 32:38.716
to its original course on autopilot.

32:38.784 --> 32:40.539
So, cutting off the server didn't work.

32:40.576 --> 32:42.076
That's impossible.

32:42.113 --> 32:43.883
Yeah, unless the hacker
managed to disable

32:43.920 --> 32:45.771
the autopilot reset protocol somehow?

32:47.626 --> 32:49.160
Oh, excuse me.

32:49.428 --> 32:51.309
Excuse me, you're just gonna
answer the phone right now?

32:51.345 --> 32:52.326
Gordon Meredith.

32:52.363 --> 32:54.318
Restore access to the Bradley
analytic servers now!

32:54.355 --> 32:56.623
Boston? Oh, my God, you're alive!

32:56.748 --> 32:58.586
Okay, okay, I'm putting you
on speakerphone here.

32:58.623 --> 33:00.338
I got the whole team
and a guy named Garret.

33:00.405 --> 33:01.739
He's nice. I'll tell you later.

33:01.975 --> 33:03.295
Boston, are you with Zapata?

33:03.332 --> 33:05.945
No! No, she's in a building
filled with C4

33:05.982 --> 33:07.836
waiting to press "enter"
so that she can stop a plane

33:07.873 --> 33:09.274
from crashing into
the nation's capital.

33:09.310 --> 33:11.218
That is not a thing
I thought I'd ever say!

33:11.316 --> 33:13.217
Restoring access now.

33:19.451 --> 33:22.498
Come on, guys. You can do this.

33:24.096 --> 33:26.030
Access restored!

33:30.695 --> 33:31.995
Nice work, everyone.

33:42.678 --> 33:44.916
Oh, my God. Hello?

33:44.983 --> 33:46.484
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Weitz!

33:46.551 --> 33:48.529
Yeah, every... everybody's
okay, I think.

33:48.566 --> 33:50.430
Okay, okay, I need you to confirm

33:50.467 --> 33:52.590
that, uh, uh, the autopilot is on.

33:52.658 --> 33:54.920
<i>There's a readout
in front of the pilot seat.</i>

33:54.967 --> 33:57.161
<i>It should have a green light
that says "engage."</i>

33:57.275 --> 33:59.597
<i>- Do you see that?</i>
- Copy that.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.717
We're leveling off, we're back.

34:01.842 --> 34:03.367
<i>We're on autopilot, baby!</i>

34:03.842 --> 34:05.636
Yes! Yes! Oh, God.

34:06.092 --> 34:08.951
Oh, that was close!

34:09.014 --> 34:11.475
Okay! Huh?

34:11.701 --> 34:13.610
Uhh! Think I have a bit of an ulcer.

34:15.616 --> 34:17.161
Aah!

34:26.658 --> 34:28.411
Boston?

34:29.193 --> 34:31.076
Boston, wh-what just happened?

34:36.268 --> 34:37.435
The warehouse is...

34:37.502 --> 34:38.869
<i>it's... it's gone.</i>

34:38.937 --> 34:41.170
Boston, where's Zapata?
Where's Zapata?!

34:41.248 --> 34:42.706
I'm sorry.

34:50.068 --> 34:51.889
What? How did you...

34:51.945 --> 34:54.413
Like I said, how hard
is it to push "enter"?

34:56.598 --> 34:57.803
Ohh!

34:57.853 --> 34:59.060
She's okay!

34:59.141 --> 35:00.508
<i>Zapata's alive!</i>

35:06.645 --> 35:08.045
Okay, come on, let's hug it out.

35:08.082 --> 35:09.381
- Huh?
- All right.

35:09.418 --> 35:11.446
Here's to the people we care
about still being alive.

35:11.483 --> 35:13.217
Okay, that's enough hugging.

35:13.372 --> 35:16.521
Matthew... did you just save us?

35:16.596 --> 35:19.287
Okay... you saved us.

35:19.359 --> 35:21.342
Oh, well, technically...

35:22.248 --> 35:24.248
I think anyone in my position

35:24.316 --> 35:26.717
with courage and the presence of mind

35:26.785 --> 35:28.592
to act quickly would have
done the same thing, so...

35:28.674 --> 35:29.807
Thank you.

35:29.844 --> 35:31.537
Oh, no thanks necessary.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.257
But, um...

35:33.325 --> 35:35.014
...just to say out loud,

35:35.158 --> 35:37.935
you don't wanna be known
as the woman who fired the guy

35:37.998 --> 35:40.598
who saved Air Force One, do ya?

35:42.174 --> 35:44.376
The FBI is lucky to have you.

35:44.982 --> 35:48.151
Like you said, luck's got
nothin' to do with it.

35:48.784 --> 35:50.373
We're alive, you guys!

35:50.475 --> 35:52.428
That's nice, huh?

36:00.015 --> 36:04.186
Our entire plan,
months of work, all gone.

36:04.276 --> 36:06.077
It was an abject failure.

36:06.114 --> 36:07.481
I've got worse news.

36:07.518 --> 36:08.918
How is that possible?

36:09.158 --> 36:12.171
Zapata and her friend
managed to escape somehow.

36:12.554 --> 36:14.696
She has enough
evidence to burn us down.

36:15.194 --> 36:17.699
We have to disappear, now!

36:18.038 --> 36:20.937
- And then what?
- We focus on Helios.

36:21.818 --> 36:23.337
They may have won the battle...

36:23.374 --> 36:26.132
but the war is far from over.

36:46.443 --> 36:47.820
I'm really glad you're okay.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.897
Yeah, I'm glad I'm okay, too.

36:50.633 --> 36:51.962
You know, just because, uh,

36:51.999 --> 36:53.303
I would have had to give your eulogy,

36:53.340 --> 36:54.803
and I hate sad public speaking.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.499
Oh, you would not be giving my eulogy.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.028
Because you're alive,
so there'd be no need.

36:58.065 --> 37:00.303
Boston... where's Zapata?

37:00.421 --> 37:02.108
She said she had
to take care of something.

37:02.145 --> 37:03.350
Hmm.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.554
Once a lone wolf...

37:04.591 --> 37:06.124
Not helping, Rich.

37:07.405 --> 37:08.716
- Hey.
- Aah!

37:09.038 --> 37:11.405
Put the phone down... now.

37:12.488 --> 37:14.486
Is... is this still Remi, or...

37:14.523 --> 37:16.116
No! No, no, no.

37:16.241 --> 37:18.210
I'm me, I'm... I'm Jane again.

37:18.284 --> 37:19.684
Remi is... gone.

37:19.736 --> 37:21.994
And, uh, I'm... I'm really
sorry for everything

37:22.031 --> 37:23.725
I did to you while I was her.

37:24.647 --> 37:27.135
And we're... we're just all,
just cool with her again?

37:27.203 --> 37:29.062
- We're all good.
- It was days ago.

37:29.099 --> 37:31.272
Okay. Apology accepted?

37:31.309 --> 37:33.844
And... and thank you
for helping Kurt find me.

37:34.137 --> 37:36.497
Ah, yes, I was helpful, wasn't I?

37:36.575 --> 37:38.624
Pretty helpful today, too,
with the whole stopping

37:38.661 --> 37:41.083
the Air Force One from crashing
into the White House thing.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.221
Yeah, we appreciate everything
that you did for us, Boston.

37:43.731 --> 37:46.187
Which is why we're releasing
you from house arrest.

37:46.457 --> 37:47.724
I'm free?

37:47.770 --> 37:49.791
- Like, free-free?
- Yes.

37:49.859 --> 37:51.099
Not only that, there might be

37:51.160 --> 37:52.942
an opportunity for you here at the FBI.

37:52.997 --> 37:54.262
I'm sorry... opportunity?

37:54.299 --> 37:56.900
You... you mean, like
an opportunity-opportunity?

37:56.999 --> 37:59.053
I-I think I might take some

37:59.090 --> 38:01.372
some "me" time, uh...

38:01.450 --> 38:03.805
You know, work on my art,
try to get inspired again.

38:03.887 --> 38:05.707
I... I'm not sure if the whole...

38:05.950 --> 38:08.569
bang-bang, shoot-'em-up,
almost-die-every-5-minutes thing

38:08.606 --> 38:10.945
is really my... deal.

38:10.982 --> 38:12.755
All right, well,
if you change your mind,

38:12.804 --> 38:14.338
offer still stands.

38:14.869 --> 38:16.349
Now, the White House
and the Secret Service,

38:16.385 --> 38:18.138
they thank us all
for our work today, but...

38:18.174 --> 38:19.821
we still have a pretty big
task ahead of us.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.473
Madeline's still missing.

38:21.544 --> 38:23.591
And she destroyed everything
useful in her office.

38:23.809 --> 38:26.628
All of her files, all of her servers.

38:26.715 --> 38:28.096
She knew we were coming for her.

38:28.184 --> 38:29.364
And what I don't get is,

38:29.401 --> 38:31.395
why try and take down Air Force One?

38:31.661 --> 38:34.302
Seems like a long way to go
to secure a business contract.

38:34.370 --> 38:35.603
I agree.

38:35.671 --> 38:37.572
We need to find exactly
what Madeline was after,

38:37.801 --> 38:39.707
what her end game is...

38:39.954 --> 38:41.822
and where the hell she's hiding.

38:49.585 --> 38:51.486
Assistant Director Reade.

38:51.553 --> 38:52.954
<i>Reade, it's me.</i>

38:53.022 --> 38:54.913
Tasha, where are you?
I'm on my way to Zurich.

38:54.950 --> 38:57.458
I know where Madeline keeps the
documents she won't destroy.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.507
It could be the key to finding her.

38:59.544 --> 39:01.387
Why are you going by yourself?
Let me send backup.

39:01.458 --> 39:02.931
<i>No, I've gotta do this on my own.</i>

39:03.645 --> 39:06.467
I know that there's a part
of you that doesn't trust me.

39:07.083 --> 39:08.923
<i>But I'm gonna prove once and for all</i>

39:08.960 --> 39:11.161
whose side I've always been on.

39:12.700 --> 39:14.090
Natasha?

39:20.449 --> 39:22.550
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:22.817 --> 39:24.780
I'm sorry our little romantic getaway

39:24.817 --> 39:26.254
didn't go according to plan.

39:27.864 --> 39:28.928
I don't know.

39:28.965 --> 39:30.377
These zombies don't exactly make me

39:30.414 --> 39:32.148
wanna sleep in the woods.

39:32.594 --> 39:34.137
And anyway...

39:34.262 --> 39:36.497
we don't have to go away
to be together.

39:37.036 --> 39:40.176
I got everything I need right here.

39:40.911 --> 39:42.437
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.520
What about here?

39:45.153 --> 39:46.908
No.

39:47.211 --> 39:48.311
Go away!

39:49.712 --> 39:52.213
- Is that a friend of yours?
- I don't know.

40:01.265 --> 40:02.532
What is it?

40:02.569 --> 40:04.692
Somebody left an envelope
addressed to you.

40:06.127 --> 40:07.495
Thank you.

40:11.848 --> 40:13.601
Everything all right?

40:13.911 --> 40:16.028
It's from Shepherd's estate lawyer.

40:16.106 --> 40:17.307
What, is it a will?

40:17.344 --> 40:18.997
No, it's just this envelope.

40:20.976 --> 40:22.377
You don't have to open that.

40:22.731 --> 40:23.978
She's gone, Jane.

40:24.106 --> 40:27.315
Which means I finally
can get some closure.

40:27.567 --> 40:29.890
And... I don't want whatever's in here

40:29.927 --> 40:31.783
hanging over me.

40:31.975 --> 40:33.450
Or us.

40:43.422 --> 40:44.840
Uh...

40:45.153 --> 40:46.834
It's some kind of puzzle.

40:47.925 --> 40:50.005
Another mystery from beyond the grave.

40:51.056 --> 40:52.857
So much for closure.

41:51.633 --> 41:52.867
Aah!
