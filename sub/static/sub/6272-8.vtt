00:06.081 --> 00:08.082
<i>Previously on
"Masters of Sex"...</i>

00:08.084 --> 00:11.552
Libby, we have a family.
Just the two of us...

00:11.554 --> 00:13.471
That's enough for me.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.326
We can resume the capping
with Bill's frozen sperm,

00:16.327 --> 00:18.427
but he knows the odds are
essentially a million to one.

00:18.429 --> 00:20.930
If he thinks I've intervened,
he will have my head.

00:20.932 --> 00:23.332
Aren't you worried leaving
me alone in your apartment?

00:23.334 --> 00:24.967
Should I be?

00:26.136 --> 00:28.137
My last girlfriend, she didn't
like spending the night.

00:28.139 --> 00:29.672
I had my heart broken.

00:29.674 --> 00:32.975
- Is it over between you two?
- That's the past.

00:32.977 --> 00:36.312
You, me... that's the future.

00:36.314 --> 00:38.314
Virginia. Dr. DePaul.

00:38.316 --> 00:41.852
Whom we were lucky enough
to lure away from Cornell.

00:41.853 --> 00:43.840
I'm going to start
a clinical outreach program.

00:43.842 --> 00:45.442
That could save
millions of women's lives.

00:45.444 --> 00:47.010
I know I don't have an M.D.,

00:47.012 --> 00:50.380
but I do know which strings to pull
around here to get things done.

00:50.382 --> 00:53.984
$12,000 for the first 6 months.
Can you pull those strings?

00:54.733 --> 00:57.836
- Mrs. Scully?
- Oh, Dr. Langham, w-what a nice surprise.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.525
I've never had
any secrets from him.

01:02.034 --> 01:05.802
But now I have you,
and I want to tell everyone.

01:05.803 --> 01:08.932
- But you won't, right?
- This is complicated for me.

01:08.934 --> 01:11.127
I mean, I love my wife.

01:14.238 --> 01:16.606
We should undertake
the research with each other.

01:19.944 --> 01:23.447
- We could go out for a bite.
- I can't.

01:23.449 --> 01:27.217
I'm meeting Libby
for a late dinner.

01:27.219 --> 01:28.585
All right, then.

Season 1, Episode 8
"Love and Marriage"

02:20.511 --> 02:23.511
Synced by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

02:23.854 --> 02:28.958
- Well, did he say anything to you?
- Jane, don't worry.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.227
He thinks...
You're a good secretary.

02:31.229 --> 02:32.928
Well, he doesn't seem
happy at all.

02:32.930 --> 02:36.065
Dr. Masters
rarely seems happy with anyone.

02:36.068 --> 02:39.035
Now, there are a few things...
Minor things.

02:39.036 --> 02:42.304
For example, when Dr. Masters
says "It's getting late,"

02:42.306 --> 02:44.173
what he really means is
"You're staying late."

02:44.175 --> 02:46.308
So I shouldn't ask
if I'm staying?

02:46.310 --> 02:47.810
No, just assume that you are.

02:47.812 --> 02:52.014
What he really expects of you
is to act like a seismometer,

02:52.016 --> 02:56.318
registering his unspoken vibrations
from miles away.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.753
Okay.

02:57.755 --> 03:00.022
And he's very fussy
about his desk, as you know.

03:00.024 --> 03:03.726
So, just remember, mail gets stacked
on the left, coffee on the right,

03:03.728 --> 03:06.262
and no stray paper clips
anywhere, ever.

03:06.264 --> 03:07.596
- No paper clips.
- Ever.

03:07.598 --> 03:08.998
- And no mayonnaise.
- On his desk?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.734
No, on his pressed
ham sandwich or any sandwich.

03:11.736 --> 03:13.873
He'd prefer there were a law
against mayonnaise.

03:14.906 --> 03:17.706
No mayonnaise, paper clips,
or questions.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.575
- That's right.

03:19.577 --> 03:22.945
He's an odd one, Dr. Masters, but at least
he's not like my cousin Mae's boss.

03:22.947 --> 03:26.515
She kept me on the phone
for two hours last night crying.

03:28.719 --> 03:30.052
Crying?

03:30.054 --> 03:32.288
Mae devoted her
entire life to Mr. Burwell...

03:32.290 --> 03:35.224
That's his name.
Did everything he asked...

03:35.226 --> 03:37.026
Typing, filing,

03:37.028 --> 03:40.930
late-night sex
on the mimeograph.

03:40.932 --> 03:43.098
Basically put all of her eggs
in his basket,

03:43.100 --> 03:47.970
until one day, his wife got wind,
and Mae was o-u-t...

03:47.972 --> 03:50.372
No severance,
no letter of recommendation.

03:50.374 --> 03:53.876
He didn't just fire her.
He rubbed her out of existence.

03:55.646 --> 03:58.180
That sounds... a little extreme.

03:58.182 --> 04:01.083
Actually, it's
the oldest story in the book.

04:01.085 --> 04:05.521
He was married, he felt guilty,
so she paid the price.

04:06.924 --> 04:09.558
Anyway, do you want to try
the new snack shack for lunch?

04:09.560 --> 04:13.462
Oh, I'd love to, but I have
some work to finish up at lunch.

04:24.808 --> 04:27.443
Mrs. Masters?

04:29.080 --> 04:31.714
I'm Walter.

04:31.716 --> 04:35.718
The handyman, Walter.
You called me about the gutters?

04:35.720 --> 04:39.054
Of course. I'm so sorry.
Um...

04:39.056 --> 04:41.056
From your voice
on the phone, I-I...

04:41.058 --> 04:43.225
Thought you were older.

04:43.227 --> 04:45.628
It's... it's this way.
Please. Come in.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.296
Thank you.

04:47.298 --> 04:49.865
Let me find you
the key to the shed.

04:49.867 --> 04:52.868
- Can I get you a lemonade or...?
- No, thank you.

04:52.870 --> 04:56.171
You probably think it's silly
to hire someone to clean your gutters.

04:56.173 --> 04:58.240
It's usually the husband's job.

04:58.242 --> 05:01.710
Mine works so hard, I can't remember
the last time he got around to it.

05:01.712 --> 05:03.646
Well, I did check them
before I knocked.

05:03.648 --> 05:06.348
I'd say he was last up there
around D-Day.

05:08.552 --> 05:10.686
Actually, I think Hoover
was still president.

05:13.723 --> 05:15.324
You can return these
when you're finished.

05:15.326 --> 05:16.759
Yes, ma'am.

05:24.936 --> 05:27.336
Dr. Johnson.

05:27.338 --> 05:30.005
Dr. DePaul.

05:30.007 --> 05:33.475
I was wondering if I might
take a moment of your time.

05:33.477 --> 05:35.110
I'm busy.

05:35.112 --> 05:39.581
Oh, I can see that,
but they look like they could wait.

05:43.219 --> 05:45.955
Did you know every
teaching hospital in the country

05:45.957 --> 05:49.725
assigns the bodies
donated to science a number?

05:49.727 --> 05:52.528
Meaning the students have
no connection to the dead.

05:52.530 --> 05:56.332
Instead, I ask families
to tell me names, stories,

05:56.334 --> 05:58.400
anything about their loved one,

05:58.402 --> 06:02.237
so that my students will understand
this was once a human being.

06:04.341 --> 06:09.011
Well, I hope you
can be as generous with me.

06:09.013 --> 06:12.481
I want to complete
my undergraduate degree,

06:12.483 --> 06:15.217
and one of the requirements
for a B.S.

06:15.219 --> 06:17.653
Is basic anatomy... your class.

06:17.655 --> 06:21.590
But since I've logged
so many hours with Dr. Masters

06:21.592 --> 06:24.493
and learned so much
about anatomy already,

06:24.495 --> 06:28.230
I-I was hoping I could
place out of your class.

06:28.232 --> 06:30.666
Why would you want a degree?

06:30.668 --> 06:33.302
You're doing fine
using your other assets.

06:34.337 --> 06:37.708
Because I'd like to avoid
comments like that in the future.

06:39.443 --> 06:43.912
Look, there's obviously
no love lost between us,

06:43.914 --> 06:45.981
so wouldn't it just be easier...

06:45.983 --> 06:47.249
No.

06:47.251 --> 06:50.753
No, you cannot
place out of my class.

06:50.755 --> 06:54.623
Well, can I at least get partial
credit for my work with Dr. Masters?

06:54.625 --> 06:56.592
No.

06:59.362 --> 07:00.996
Well...

07:00.998 --> 07:03.699
I suppose I'll see you
in class then.

07:05.769 --> 07:08.404
<i>...With service</i>
<i>to pueblo, Colorado,</i>

07:08.406 --> 07:11.940

07:46.477 --> 07:50.112

<i>in one hour on platform A.</i>

08:03.860 --> 08:05.961
Austin.

08:07.067 --> 08:08.282
Margaret.

08:08.283 --> 08:10.156
I was, uh, wondering
if we could have...

08:10.157 --> 08:11.464
We need to talk.

08:13.269 --> 08:15.771
Uh, all right. Uh...

08:15.773 --> 08:19.608
I-I'm, uh, beginning to have second
thoughts about our going away tonight.

08:19.610 --> 08:23.745
In... in fact, I'm... I'm having second
thoughts about a number of things.

08:23.747 --> 08:26.286
You mean
about us seeing each other?

08:28.218 --> 08:32.020
Well, Margaret, that... is a blow.

08:32.022 --> 08:34.623
But, of course, if... if you've
made up your mind...

08:34.625 --> 08:36.725
I respect your decision.

08:36.727 --> 08:40.729
Of course. Having your respect
is what matters most.

08:45.668 --> 08:48.437
Well, I-I-it came to me
as I was... I was sitting here,

08:48.439 --> 08:51.740
waiting for you, thinking
how I told my dear husband

08:51.742 --> 08:54.610
I was going to visit
aunt Caroline,

08:54.612 --> 08:58.180
an aunt he... he knows
I haven't seen in 10 years.

08:58.182 --> 09:01.483
And... and I...

09:01.485 --> 09:05.120
I realized I was gonna be stuck
with that aunt Caroline story forever.

09:05.122 --> 09:07.489
And...

09:07.491 --> 09:11.560
This was never anything more
than a casual fling, anyway.

09:11.562 --> 09:13.529
Was it?

09:19.336 --> 09:21.670
I will always
think of you with...

09:21.672 --> 09:24.039
With such affection, Margaret.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.808
Of course.

09:44.527 --> 09:49.298
"Elevations of systolic
pressure are between 30mm to 80mm."

09:49.300 --> 09:55.237
"Diastolic pressure elevations are
usually in the range of 20mm to 40mm."

09:59.009 --> 10:02.347
"With minimal-intensity
orgasmic experience,"

10:02.348 --> 10:07.149
"diastolic pressure readings
essentially may be unaffected."

10:07.151 --> 10:10.586
I would read it with more
conviction at the actual presentation.

10:10.588 --> 10:13.455
Well, you could read it
with a monkey on your hat.

10:13.457 --> 10:16.391
I'm not sure that changes
the basic fact that...

10:16.393 --> 10:18.994
What, I-it's... it's boring?

10:18.996 --> 10:23.498
Isn't this why doctors publish
their findings in scientific journals,

10:23.500 --> 10:25.801
where it's supposed to
be boring?

10:25.803 --> 10:28.403
I don't want to
introduce our work in a paper.

10:28.405 --> 10:30.973
I want to use
the Friday presentations.

10:30.975 --> 10:35.277
I agree, but to stand up
there and read a list of statistics,

10:35.279 --> 10:41.216
it's... it's not exactly going to set
the world or the Friday meetings on fire.

10:41.218 --> 10:43.552
We're scientists...

10:43.554 --> 10:45.554
Not arsonists.

10:45.556 --> 10:47.923
Yes, but don't you
think w-we should start

10:47.925 --> 10:50.959
with one of our
more dynamic findings,

10:50.961 --> 10:52.995
like...

10:52.997 --> 10:55.063
Vaginal contractions?

10:55.065 --> 10:57.332
Every woman, myself included,
has experienced them,

10:57.334 --> 10:58.567
but nobody knows they exist.

10:58.569 --> 11:01.136
And we will present that... how?

11:01.138 --> 11:03.305
We know they exist
because we've watched them,

11:03.307 --> 11:07.442
but you can't wire up a vagina
for graphical verification.

11:07.444 --> 11:11.580
And so the medical community
is left taking our word for it.

11:11.582 --> 11:15.550
Do you know what we need?
Home movies.

11:15.552 --> 11:20.389
I use a Brownie to film the kids'
school plays and birthdays.

11:20.391 --> 11:25.178
And so the minute we work out how to,
uh, fit a Brownie into a woman's vagina,

11:25.179 --> 11:29.209
our problem... is solved.

11:34.338 --> 11:38.540
Uh, I think the male subject's
refractory period

11:38.542 --> 11:41.543
is... resolving.

11:41.545 --> 11:44.746
If so,
the time between resolution

11:44.748 --> 11:49.713
and a secondary arousal
is 16 minutes, 33 seconds.

11:55.491 --> 11:57.759
You don't trust my timing?

11:57.761 --> 12:00.128
I'm expected home.

12:00.130 --> 12:05.033
And I know you're trying to spend more
time with Libby in the evenings, so...

12:06.636 --> 12:09.538
- Uh, yes. Of course.
- You're right, uh...

12:09.540 --> 12:11.073
I lost track of the time.

12:11.075 --> 12:13.141
I mean, we have
all the data we need, right?

12:13.143 --> 12:14.366
I-I'll see you in the morning.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.000
- Good night.
- Good night.

12:20.116 --> 12:21.950
- Hey, kids!
- Daddy!

12:21.952 --> 12:24.052
Guess who I ran into
at the hospital today.

12:24.054 --> 12:25.887
Santa Claus!

12:25.889 --> 12:27.122
In March?

12:27.124 --> 12:30.517
- A machine gun!
- A lady Alice doll!

12:30.518 --> 12:31.627
- Bam! Bam! Bam!
- Stop that. Stop it.

12:31.628 --> 12:34.029
Elise, darling, for you.

12:34.031 --> 12:36.431
It's a Hoover constellation
vacuum.

12:36.433 --> 12:38.133
Top of the line.

12:38.135 --> 12:41.636
It actually floats on air,
like a hovercraft.

12:41.638 --> 12:44.005
- Don't shoot!
- Thank you, dear.

12:47.911 --> 12:51.079
Some poor woman is in tears.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.587
Another, please.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.561
She's late, is she?

13:08.164 --> 13:10.265
Isn't everybody always late?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.701
And everything is late...

13:12.703 --> 13:15.070
Too late. Too, too late.

13:18.041 --> 13:22.377
You picked the only nice place
in town for a proper drink.

13:22.988 --> 13:25.222
I can see you're not
a regular here.

13:26.616 --> 13:30.619
Oh, does my jacket look
like it's from Bull Shoals, Arkansas?

13:30.621 --> 13:31.887
Because you are?

13:31.889 --> 13:34.756
I moved to St. Louis
with a friend a year ago.

13:34.758 --> 13:37.659
A friend?
I like that.

13:37.661 --> 13:40.495
Are you living in sin
with this friend?

13:40.497 --> 13:42.764
Is she pressuring you to marry?

13:46.269 --> 13:48.804
We don't see each other anymore.

13:48.806 --> 13:53.375
Yes. That's going around.
Seems to be a minor epidemic.

13:53.377 --> 13:55.877
Hope you have
a pleasant evening.

14:09.692 --> 14:14.930
Are you waiting for... Barton?

14:16.933 --> 14:20.335
I was just
talking to your friend...

14:20.337 --> 14:21.903
Dale.

14:21.905 --> 14:24.506
Uh, Dale is a student
in my graduate advisory.

14:24.508 --> 14:28.048
He has a very bright future
in pathology.

14:28.049 --> 14:30.682
- Does he?
- Yeah.

14:31.114 --> 14:34.416
I thought you were
at a board meeting tonight.

14:34.418 --> 14:38.220
Canceled.
And aunt Caroline?

14:38.222 --> 14:40.956
Sick.

14:40.958 --> 14:44.125
The provost was nice enough
to call me last minute,

14:44.127 --> 14:47.729
offer to advise me on
next year's courses over drinks.

14:47.731 --> 14:51.324
But now that you're here, I-I think
I'll leave you two to a quiet evening.

14:51.325 --> 14:54.416
- Yes, let's reschedule.
- Oh, no. I insist you join us.

14:54.432 --> 14:56.838
No, I really can't intrude.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.340
I do have a new girl now,

14:58.342 --> 15:02.772
and she'll be thrilled if I show up,
surprise her, take her to a show.

15:02.894 --> 15:05.580
- May I say something to you?
- Margaret, the boy wants to go.

15:05.581 --> 15:08.582
No, I want Dale to hear this.

15:08.583 --> 15:12.668
I'm very fond of Dale, despite
our very brief friendship.

15:17.539 --> 15:19.774
Stay single.

15:19.776 --> 15:22.476
I only say this to you
because when you're young and in love,

15:22.478 --> 15:25.412
everyone thinks
they'll be the exception.

15:25.414 --> 15:29.950
Sure, maybe mom and dad slept
in separate beds, and then separate rooms.

15:29.952 --> 15:32.720
Maybe the older couples you know
bicker or fight...

15:32.722 --> 15:34.555
Maybe don't talk at all,
if they ever did.

15:34.557 --> 15:39.006
But at your age, you can't imagine
it will ever be you.

15:39.102 --> 15:41.454
But it will be.

15:43.132 --> 15:46.867
Which is bad enough,
but what's even worse...

15:48.170 --> 15:51.405
...Is how much
you'll feel like a failure...

15:53.408 --> 15:56.410
...Because when the person
who knows you best

15:56.412 --> 15:58.679
loses interest,

15:58.681 --> 16:01.949
that really
takes something out of you.

16:04.186 --> 16:07.588
Like surgery almost.

16:07.590 --> 16:10.424
And you really start
to wonder...

16:13.261 --> 16:15.596
...If you'll ever
be whole again.

16:21.203 --> 16:24.705
Anyway... I'm babbling.

16:24.707 --> 16:27.408
Excuse me, gentlemen.

16:33.348 --> 16:35.082
What in God's name...?

16:35.084 --> 16:37.885
I was just sitting here.
She started talking to me. I...

16:53.935 --> 16:59.340
That boy, Barton,
is not a graduate student.

17:01.843 --> 17:04.478
Dale gets me women...

17:04.480 --> 17:06.213
Professional women.

17:06.214 --> 17:09.415
I came here tonight
to meet a prostitute.

17:09.417 --> 17:12.486
It's not the first time
I've done this.

17:12.488 --> 17:15.981
And now that that ugly secret
is out in the open,

17:16.028 --> 17:18.325
maybe we should go in
on a room together

17:18.327 --> 17:20.663
with whoever
you're here to fuck!

17:22.382 --> 17:24.416
I...

17:36.182 --> 17:38.249
I'll get myself home.

17:42.450 --> 17:44.318
Obviously,
there's a great deal of overlap

17:44.320 --> 17:47.321
between the digestive
and the endocrine...

17:47.323 --> 17:49.490
But before we explore
the similarities,

17:49.492 --> 17:52.860
let me make my policy on
punctuality perfectly clear...

17:52.862 --> 17:54.428
It's mandatory.

17:54.430 --> 17:57.164
I apologize I'm late,
Dr. DePaul.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.466
Dr. Johnson's sorry.

17:59.468 --> 18:01.869
Who can identify this organ?

18:03.638 --> 18:04.972
Mr. Deasy?

18:04.974 --> 18:06.907
- Liver.
- Spleen.

18:08.510 --> 18:10.277
No, Mr. Deasy. It's the spleen.

18:10.279 --> 18:14.815
Which will be on the exam, gentlemen,
so I suggest you wake up.

18:20.822 --> 18:23.123
Mr. Banks?

18:39.742 --> 18:41.475
Lester?

18:44.085 --> 18:45.619
- Lester?!
- Jesus!

18:46.082 --> 18:49.350
Dr. Masters.
I thought you were Nosferatu.

18:52.021 --> 18:54.054
The Akeley pancake camera,

18:54.056 --> 18:57.391
used to shoot the first full-length
documentary, "Nanook of the North."

18:57.393 --> 18:59.293
Arriflex 35...
Same camera they used

18:59.295 --> 19:01.061
to shoot "Dark Passage"
with Bogie and Bacall.

19:01.063 --> 19:02.363
Piece of garbage.

19:02.365 --> 19:04.775
I mean, in what universe
is Agnes Moorhead the killer?

19:05.534 --> 19:08.435
And what is, uh...
What is this?

19:08.437 --> 19:13.107
It's a lesterscope...
Patent pending. I, uh, like to tinker.

19:13.109 --> 19:15.976
Five hours ago, that baby was
down the throat of a Chinaman

19:15.978 --> 19:17.711
with an esophageal tumor.

19:17.713 --> 19:18.913
It's been sterilized.

19:18.914 --> 19:21.782
And this device shoots film?

19:21.784 --> 19:24.752
I-I wouldn't shoot
a Western with it, but sure.

19:33.194 --> 19:36.130
Can I count on
your discretion, Lester?

19:37.665 --> 19:39.633
Because what I'm proposing

19:39.635 --> 19:44.238
is not like the cesarean footage
you shot for me last month.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.241
I'm now conducting some, uh...

19:47.243 --> 19:50.377
Unusual medical research.

19:51.913 --> 19:54.848
And I could use someone

19:54.850 --> 19:58.185
with your particular expertise.

20:01.289 --> 20:02.489
What is it?

20:04.325 --> 20:08.495
It's... a lens, essentially.

20:12.835 --> 20:14.935
Cold light illumination?

20:14.937 --> 20:17.504
I'm a bit of a tinkerer myself.

20:19.508 --> 20:21.175
My question for you, Lester, is

20:21.177 --> 20:23.677
can you turn that lens
into a functional

20:23.679 --> 20:26.280
and fully operational
movie camera?

I'd like to take you
out tonight...

21:54.670 --> 21:56.236
A date.

21:56.238 --> 21:59.973
Jack Lemmon and Judy Holliday
are playing at the Everstone.

22:04.812 --> 22:07.181
Y-you want to take me
to the drive-in?

22:39.681 --> 22:42.282
Gutters are
as good as new, ma'am.

22:42.284 --> 22:46.177
Uh, except your son's
been missing this.

22:48.022 --> 22:50.924
Uh, would you like
to settle up now or...?

22:50.926 --> 22:52.893
Of course.
I'll get your money.

22:58.399 --> 23:00.067
Something wrong?

23:00.069 --> 23:01.735
Uh, no. Not at all.

23:01.737 --> 23:04.104
I've, uh... I've always loved
these <i>ein houses</i>.

23:04.106 --> 23:06.773
I just never met anybody
who actually lived in one.

23:06.775 --> 23:08.542
You're an architecture buff?

23:08.544 --> 23:11.178
I spend all day
fixing up folks' houses.

23:11.180 --> 23:12.813
You pick things up.

23:14.749 --> 23:16.617
Do you know anything
about plumbing?

23:16.619 --> 23:20.087
There's a leaky faucet in the bathroom
that's driving us crazy.

23:20.089 --> 23:21.455
Sure.

23:23.424 --> 23:26.560
I don't normally
watch television during the day.

23:26.562 --> 23:28.295
I just happen to be
an Arthur Murray fan.

23:28.297 --> 23:29.763
So was my wife.

23:29.765 --> 23:32.032
Uh, she'd, uh, watch,

23:32.034 --> 23:34.501
and insist that we go dancing
every Saturday night

23:34.503 --> 23:36.069
to try to do them one better.

23:37.039 --> 23:40.507
- Are you going this Saturday?
- No, I'm not. Uh, my wife, she passed.

23:40.509 --> 23:43.710
Uh, she got sick unexpectedly.

23:43.712 --> 23:46.213
I'm so sorry.

23:49.550 --> 23:51.852
It's easier if you think less.

23:53.221 --> 23:56.823
- Yes. I've found that to be true.
- About the dancing.

23:56.825 --> 23:59.259
Now, when I was outside,
I could see you were counting beats.

23:59.261 --> 24:02.062
- Oh.
- You've got to think with your feet.

24:02.064 --> 24:05.098
Now, what they're doing right now,
that's called the tango.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.733
That first step's
a little tricky,

24:06.735 --> 24:10.637
but you go slow, slow,
quick, quick, slow.

24:10.639 --> 24:13.006
That's the pattern.

24:13.008 --> 24:17.925
- Can you do it? Oh, please.
- Oh, it... it's been a long time.

24:27.755 --> 24:30.223
Okay.

24:39.435 --> 24:41.368
Try closing your eyes.

24:51.080 --> 24:55.248
- I should hire you to be my teacher.
- No, I...

24:55.250 --> 25:00.087
I mean it. We could watch
the show and practice the steps.

25:00.089 --> 25:01.855
Then I'd have something
to dazzle my husband with

25:01.857 --> 25:03.223
some Saturday night
at the Imperial.

25:03.225 --> 25:05.125
Ah, I couldn't
take money for that, ma'am.

25:05.127 --> 25:08.495
Why not?
It's just another odd job.

25:10.031 --> 25:12.191
Now, see?
You're still counting.

25:38.559 --> 25:40.327
Steak sandwich?

25:40.329 --> 25:41.995
Thanks, Viv.

25:50.305 --> 25:55.242
I had resigned myself to Welsh rarebit.
Instead, I got steak.

25:55.244 --> 25:56.977
- Hey, I got a question for you.
- Hmm?

25:56.979 --> 25:58.843
Where can a guy
find a decent ring?

25:59.847 --> 26:03.150
- Don't tell me you knocked her up.
- What? No.

26:03.152 --> 26:06.253
But Vivian and I have been
seeing each other a while now.

26:06.255 --> 26:08.483
I think it's time to start
considering the future.

26:09.757 --> 26:12.993
- Why would you do that?
- Because...

26:12.995 --> 26:16.430
My old man was 20 when he married
my mother. I'm pushing 30.

26:16.432 --> 26:18.131
And...

26:18.133 --> 26:19.966
I've sown my oats.

26:19.968 --> 26:22.169
Maybe more than my share.

26:23.338 --> 26:25.505
Married men live longer.

26:25.507 --> 26:28.867
- Definitely feels longer.
- There are great tax benefits.

26:32.079 --> 26:35.682
And every man who's ever amounted
to anything had a wife at home.

26:35.684 --> 26:38.018
34 presidents
of the United States,

26:38.020 --> 26:39.486
and only one of them
was a bachelor,

26:39.488 --> 26:40.887
and no one remembers his name.

26:40.889 --> 26:42.255
James Buchanan.

26:44.659 --> 26:48.028
Friends come and go.
Kids grow up and move away.

26:48.030 --> 26:50.597
Even your patients
can get a second opinion.

26:50.599 --> 26:52.065
But your wife...

26:52.067 --> 26:54.701
She's the one
that sticks beside you,

26:54.703 --> 26:57.904
no matter your faults...
And failings.

26:59.674 --> 27:01.107
I've met Elise.

27:01.109 --> 27:03.677
She... she's a lovely woman.

27:03.679 --> 27:06.446
And with all respect, you're not
exactly husband of the century.

27:06.448 --> 27:10.050
You're lucky Elise has hung in there.
You ought to buy her something.

27:10.052 --> 27:14.187
I bought her a vacuum.
She didn't care that it hovered.

27:14.189 --> 27:16.523
You ought to buy her
something <i>nice.</i>

27:16.525 --> 27:22.462
To show her that loyalty and devotion
are still appreciated in this world.

27:25.666 --> 27:28.869
There is a decent
jeweler over on Washington.

27:28.871 --> 27:33.039
I know they film the outside
of vaginas in <i>those</i> kinds of films,

27:33.041 --> 27:35.041
but filming the inside?

27:35.043 --> 27:37.010
I don't think
I've ever heard of that.

27:37.012 --> 27:39.379
Because it's never
been done before.

27:39.381 --> 27:42.849
And to think it could be you
on the cutting edge of science.

27:42.851 --> 27:46.052
- I think it's creepy.
- Creepy? Why?

27:46.054 --> 27:48.989
Is it creepy to film a heart
during a bypass?

27:48.991 --> 27:50.557
It's done all the time now.

27:50.559 --> 27:52.192
Besides, nobody will even know
it's you.

27:52.194 --> 27:55.061
It will just look like
an anonymous organ.

27:58.165 --> 27:59.900
Like...

27:59.902 --> 28:02.769
One of those hand models
in those ads for dish soap?

28:02.771 --> 28:04.371
Yes, exactly,

28:04.373 --> 28:08.708
but for something slightly more
important than sparkling China.

28:10.444 --> 28:14.281
In high school, I was voted
most likely to be in pictures.

28:14.283 --> 28:18.518
See? Not only is it not creepy,
it was meant to be.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.338
But anyone who's anyone
in movies always has a screen name.

28:22.339 --> 28:24.749
Okay, then, you can
have a screen name, too.

28:27.762 --> 28:30.063
Beave St. Marie.

28:31.899 --> 28:38.238
I gave it a complete overhaul and
retrofitted it with a relay lens system.

28:38.240 --> 28:42.209
- And it shoots in color?
- At 24 frames per second.

28:45.980 --> 28:47.480
You know,
a lot of movie directors

28:47.482 --> 28:49.816
invent their own cameras...
Georges Méliès, Orson Welles.

28:49.818 --> 28:52.419
Not that I'd compare myself
to Welles, but...

28:52.421 --> 28:56.456
- No?
- Stylistically, I'm closer to Hitchcock.

28:58.759 --> 29:01.094
Does Ulysses
still have a vibrating function?

29:01.096 --> 29:02.629
I had to disable it.

29:02.631 --> 29:06.499
Why would a camera have a vibrating
function? That would ruin the focus.

29:06.501 --> 29:11.538
The vibrating sensation
helps some women achieve orgasm.

29:16.644 --> 29:22.849
Lester Linden, our documentarian,
this is patient F-26-002.

29:22.851 --> 29:24.484
- Pleasure.
- Ma'am.

29:24.486 --> 29:28.421
Okay, then.
Guess I'm ready for my close-up.

29:34.996 --> 29:38.331
She controls the device,
but you control the camera.

29:38.333 --> 29:42.002
Now, the trick here
will be focus.

29:44.639 --> 29:46.906
Vaginas don't bite.

29:48.509 --> 29:50.477
Tell me when to start.

29:52.847 --> 29:55.915
When should she start, Lester?
You're the director.

30:04.592 --> 30:05.992
Action.

30:07.028 --> 30:11.431
I fear Lester may have
been in over his head tonight.

30:11.433 --> 30:13.533
So to speak.

30:13.535 --> 30:16.803
Well, I suppose all we can do

30:16.805 --> 30:19.572
is wait and see
what "hitch" comes back with.

30:24.512 --> 30:27.747
We still have time
to get some work in.

30:29.016 --> 30:33.653
Uh, actually, I was hoping we might
postpone our session until tomorrow night.

30:35.423 --> 30:37.090
Because...?

30:38.259 --> 30:42.462
It turns out
I have something to do tonight.

30:51.740 --> 30:54.708
Dr. Lloyd Danes. 79 years old.

30:54.710 --> 30:58.311
He and wife Susan had four
children, nine grandchildren.

30:58.313 --> 31:00.914
An ophthalmologist,
a fly fisherman.

31:00.916 --> 31:03.462
He played the accordion every
Saturday night at Dooley’s.

31:05.053 --> 31:08.021
Can you play
the accordion, Mr. Deasy?

31:08.023 --> 31:11.558
- No, ma'am.
- I didn't think so.

31:37.519 --> 31:39.452
Ladies first.

31:49.097 --> 31:51.998
Smelling salts
for Mr. Banks, please.

32:11.051 --> 32:14.487
<i>Well, anyhow, I can tell everything about
a person from their canceled checks.</i>

32:14.489 --> 32:16.923
<i>- Can you tell about me?</i>
<i>- Everything.</i>

32:16.925 --> 32:21.261
<i>- Everything?</i>
<i>- Everything.</i>

32:21.263 --> 32:24.497
<i>Well...
Is it all right?</i>

32:24.499 --> 32:25.999
<i>Well, yes.</i>

32:26.001 --> 32:29.903
<i>You're frivolous,
romantic, generous,</i>

32:29.905 --> 32:31.738
<i>somewhat over-impulsive.</i>

32:31.740 --> 32:34.908
<i>You're ambitious.</i>
<i>You're a little scatterbrained.</i>

32:34.910 --> 32:35.975
<i>You also have a weakness...</i>

32:35.977 --> 32:38.211
Why do you keep looking at me?

32:38.213 --> 32:41.714
Because I'd take you
over Judy Holliday any day.

32:45.719 --> 32:50.223
Do you know how many times in our marriage
I've wondered if you were insane?

32:50.225 --> 32:55.195
But you taking me here, now, given
everything... This is proof.

33:02.670 --> 33:05.305
More proof.

33:22.323 --> 33:24.490
We didn't have drive-ins
in our day.

33:24.491 --> 33:27.927
We didn't need them. We were
married when we first slept together.

33:27.929 --> 33:31.831
- We were of our time.
- That's not why we waited.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.638
Barton...

33:42.443 --> 33:48.538
I-I have spent the day racking
my brains, pacing, wondering...

33:49.184 --> 33:52.018
"Maybe I should
light his clothes on fire."

33:52.020 --> 33:53.953
"Maybe I should drive his car
into the pool."

33:53.955 --> 33:56.289
"Maybe I should tell him all
about the man I've been seeing,"

33:56.291 --> 33:59.300
who, by the way, wanted me in his bed,
though he didn't love me.

33:59.326 --> 34:01.661
- Marg... Margaret...
- I don't say this to punish you,

34:01.663 --> 34:03.396
although God knows
you deserve to be punished.

34:03.398 --> 34:04.797
I mean, prostitutes?

34:04.799 --> 34:07.897
That is so insulting to me
and so far beneath you.

34:07.923 --> 34:11.905
I will... I will... I will never
do it again ever. I swear to you.

34:11.907 --> 34:14.306
Even if you never
laid a hand on a hooker again,

34:14.309 --> 34:17.342
that wouldn't change what is
so impossible to understand.

34:17.344 --> 34:21.781
This morning, when you came
in my room, I was practically naked,

34:21.783 --> 34:24.751
and you didn't look
at my body once.

34:24.753 --> 34:27.587
Not once.

34:27.589 --> 34:31.891
And yet your face
was filled with such...

34:31.893 --> 34:33.326
Love.

34:34.527 --> 34:38.023
Because I love you.
You know that.

34:38.024 --> 34:40.833
We didn't sleep
together before we were married

34:40.835 --> 34:43.670
because you weren't interested
in sleeping with me.

34:43.672 --> 34:50.976
And I excused it away by saying passion
is for teenagers and... nymphomaniacs.

34:50.978 --> 34:53.980
Passion is not what makes
a good marriage.

34:53.982 --> 34:58.017
This is a perfect,
beautiful man who loves me,

34:58.019 --> 35:00.586
who doesn't care
that I'm tall and athletic,

35:00.588 --> 35:03.256
who doesn't...

35:03.258 --> 35:05.792
Doesn't want me
to act stupider than I am.

35:05.794 --> 35:08.361
This is a man
who understands me.

35:08.363 --> 35:12.161
And 30 years later,
we're still the best of friends.

35:12.162 --> 35:15.330
How many people can say that?

35:16.571 --> 35:19.373
It's not enough.

35:21.208 --> 35:24.711
- We have to divorce.
- What?!

35:24.713 --> 35:27.647
- Absolutely not!
- We have to.

35:27.649 --> 35:29.615
Margaret...

35:29.617 --> 35:32.885
I'm the person who knows you best.
I know you don't want a divorce.

35:32.887 --> 35:35.822
- But this is broken.
- And I do not want a divorce.

35:35.824 --> 35:38.057
- Barton.
- So we're not getting divorced.

35:38.059 --> 35:40.526
This marriage of ours is broken.

35:40.528 --> 35:44.664
And unless you want me
to break along with it...

35:44.666 --> 35:46.412
You have to let me go.

35:46.413 --> 35:49.369
<i>It wasn't very long after I met
Nina that she got her promotion...</i>

35:49.371 --> 35:52.271
<i>Her first chance
to write a radio show.</i>

36:09.757 --> 36:14.360
I thought only students
haunted the library at this hour.

36:17.358 --> 36:20.393
I found our work tonight
with Dr. Danes very exciting.

36:22.369 --> 36:26.205
The accordionist/
ophthalmologist.

36:28.208 --> 36:32.145
If you'll excuse me, I need
to prepare for my presentation tomorrow.

36:32.147 --> 36:34.380
The pap-smear proposal?

36:34.382 --> 36:37.984
Dr. Masters
is planning to be there.

36:37.986 --> 36:39.986
Well, that makes one.

36:50.631 --> 36:53.466
Have you ever seen
a roomful of male doctors

36:53.468 --> 36:56.035
listen to a lecture
on female cancers?

36:58.005 --> 37:00.573
They're not exactly riveted?

37:00.575 --> 37:02.442
Not exactly.

37:02.444 --> 37:07.213
Men are such idiots.
Even the smart ones.

37:10.217 --> 37:14.153
You should ask a friend to go
and clap loudly.

37:14.155 --> 37:17.523
Uh, sometimes a-a ringer helps.

37:17.525 --> 37:20.760
I don't want their adulation.
I just want them to support me.

37:20.762 --> 37:23.796
This work
is very important to me.

37:24.595 --> 37:28.063
Then I'm sure
it will go your way.

37:31.004 --> 37:35.775
Lower thoracic? You should
be much further along than that.

37:36.110 --> 37:39.578
Underestimate my exam
at your own peril.

37:39.581 --> 37:44.851
I wouldn't be here at this hour
if I underestimated your exam.

37:52.439 --> 37:56.508
Teardrops are popular.
What color are your wife's eyes?

37:56.510 --> 38:00.178
Brown. Uh,
more green, maybe?

38:00.180 --> 38:01.813
Let's say hazel.

38:01.815 --> 38:04.816
In which case, you can't
go wrong with emeralds.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.252
What about this one?

38:07.755 --> 38:09.054
What is that... 1/10 of a carat?

38:09.056 --> 38:10.922
You'll have to buy her
a microscope to go with that.

38:10.924 --> 38:12.357
No, let's see, um...

38:14.460 --> 38:16.661
Let's see this one.

38:16.663 --> 38:19.431
Remember, the ring's supposed
to cost at least two months' salary.

38:19.433 --> 38:21.867
I'm still a fellow.
You know what they pay me.

38:21.869 --> 38:23.735
I was in med school
when I proposed to Elise...

38:23.737 --> 38:25.737
Actually hocked my car
to buy her a ring.

38:25.739 --> 38:29.608
I was gonna take her to <i>Chez nous</i>,
get the chef to stick it in a cream puff.

38:29.610 --> 38:31.710
But she swallowed it?

38:33.012 --> 38:35.714
I missed the date.

38:35.716 --> 38:37.949
There was a stomach bug
going around.

38:37.951 --> 38:40.552
She found me passed out
on the bathroom floor.

38:40.554 --> 38:42.754
She drove me
to the emergency room.

38:42.756 --> 38:43.956
So there I was, okay?

38:43.957 --> 38:46.124
I was... oh, thank you...
Sprawled on a gurney,

38:46.126 --> 38:48.126
and the ring falls out
of my coat pocket.

38:48.128 --> 38:50.328
Well, I could barely sit up.

38:51.798 --> 38:55.801
But I said to her, "Everything
I own is in that ring."

38:55.803 --> 38:57.803
"And it's yours
if you'll take me."

38:59.872 --> 39:01.740
Everybody in the E.R. applauded.

39:07.146 --> 39:08.713
Do you have a layaway plan?

39:10.483 --> 39:12.617
There's a popular misconception

39:12.619 --> 39:15.554
the pap smear requires
costly equipment

39:15.556 --> 39:17.789
and lots of training
to administer...

39:17.791 --> 39:20.892
Training you won't find outside
a world-class hospital like this one.

39:20.894 --> 39:24.786
Well, it seems expensive now,
but don't forget, a ring lasts forever.

39:24.794 --> 39:26.775
<i>It's teachable,
and it saves women's lives.</i>

39:26.776 --> 39:28.334
And Vivian will be thrilled.

39:28.335 --> 39:30.735
Women always are...
At the beginning.

39:30.737 --> 39:32.003
Next slide, please.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.818
Next slide!

39:40.913 --> 39:43.615
This sample was taken
from a 42-year-old patient

39:43.617 --> 39:45.984
with no family history
of malignancy.

39:45.986 --> 39:48.653
Note the poorly differentiated
cells...

39:48.655 --> 39:51.022
Stage iv cervical cancer.

39:51.024 --> 39:53.859
With early screening, this woman
could have been cured.

39:53.861 --> 39:56.695
Instead, she has
early metastases to the liver.

39:56.697 --> 40:00.432
Would anyone care to venture
a prognosis?

40:02.935 --> 40:05.904
She's terminal, obviously.

40:05.906 --> 40:08.740
Which is why it's incumbent
on hospitals like this one

40:08.742 --> 40:11.109
to lead the charge
in Pap test education.

40:11.111 --> 40:14.546
What I'm proposing is a pilot
program to train country doctors

40:14.548 --> 40:15.714
to become proficient
in deduction...

40:15.716 --> 40:19.885
How 'bout that Dr. DePaul?
Guaranteed cure for insomnia.

40:19.887 --> 40:22.420
<i>...Treatment for their patients
once the results have been determined.</i>

40:22.422 --> 40:23.922
<i>The possibility...</i>

40:23.924 --> 40:26.491
The truth is, I can feel
resistance to my plan already.

40:26.493 --> 40:27.659
You saw that room.

40:27.661 --> 40:29.794
And the administration
is already rumbling

40:29.796 --> 40:31.930
there's insufficient funding
for my proposal.

40:31.932 --> 40:33.999
Funding...
A process that will leave you

40:34.001 --> 40:36.401
feeling like the Minotaur
in the maze.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.572
I have six months.

40:41.875 --> 40:44.442
Funding can take years.

40:44.444 --> 40:48.113
Hmm. You seem to have gotten
your study funded quickly enough.

40:48.115 --> 40:51.783
My study is mainly
paid out of pocket... mine.

40:51.785 --> 40:55.353
Including
Mrs. Johnson's salary?

40:55.355 --> 40:57.322
Primarily.

40:57.324 --> 41:00.225
She functions
as more than a secretary,

41:00.227 --> 41:01.893
but the hospital
won't subsidize her

41:01.895 --> 41:04.963
for her research work
because she's uncredentialed.

41:04.965 --> 41:09.267
It galls me to say it, but
she may be one of my better students.

41:11.237 --> 41:13.305
Her credential
might not be far off.

41:15.408 --> 41:18.376
She's doing well, then?

41:19.680 --> 41:24.015
Exam's tomorrow. We'll see.

41:24.017 --> 41:27.185
The bottom line is, I need
to push my proposal through,

41:27.187 --> 41:28.620
I need to do it now,

41:28.622 --> 41:31.890
and I'm not going to be shy
about asking for your help.

42:29.982 --> 42:32.684
I'm ready to head to room 5 now.

42:32.686 --> 42:35.120
You?

42:41.560 --> 42:43.228
I've been, uh...

42:43.230 --> 42:45.230
I've been thinking
about something.

42:45.232 --> 42:48.166
Uh, you've mentioned
several times

42:48.168 --> 42:52.937
about continuing...
Your education.

42:55.508 --> 42:56.808
Yes, uh...

42:56.810 --> 43:01.379
Your... your point was always
that the timing was off.

43:01.381 --> 43:05.283
Hmm. But it's important to you.

43:11.957 --> 43:16.027
Then... if you want to
pick up a class

43:16.029 --> 43:19.397
here and there in the evenings,

43:19.399 --> 43:21.666
I won't object.

43:23.836 --> 43:26.237
You've been
talking to Dr. DePaul?

43:28.674 --> 43:31.076
No.

43:31.078 --> 43:34.379
I'm actually
sitting in on her anatomy class.

43:36.416 --> 43:40.318
Taking it, in fact,
for credit...

43:40.320 --> 43:41.586
Now.

43:41.588 --> 43:43.888
Excellent.

43:43.890 --> 43:47.392
Um, of course, you could have
told me, but, uh...

43:47.394 --> 43:49.761
How's it going?

43:49.763 --> 43:52.897
W-we have
our first big test tomorrow.

43:52.899 --> 43:55.567
Well, you should
be at home, studying.

43:56.870 --> 44:01.272
Uh, w-we can resume our work
tomorrow night.

44:01.274 --> 44:04.476
- Are you sure?
- Very sure.

44:09.348 --> 44:11.549
I can't...

44:11.551 --> 44:15.420
I can't tell you how much
that means to me, Bill.

44:15.422 --> 44:18.119
- Well...
- Thank you.

44:18.186 --> 44:22.121
And I will never let my classes
interfere with our work here.

44:24.563 --> 44:26.713
Good luck tomorrow.

44:31.971 --> 44:33.338
The heart?

44:33.340 --> 44:34.873
No, it's in his head.

44:34.875 --> 44:37.776
Right... temporal fossa.

44:37.778 --> 44:40.011
Good.

44:40.013 --> 44:42.647
I don't know why
you're even doing this.

44:42.649 --> 44:45.984
To get a degree.
I explained that to you, didn't I?

44:48.821 --> 44:51.055
Icky blue vein?

44:51.057 --> 44:52.891
No?

44:52.893 --> 44:56.861
But why do you need a degree
when you already have a job?

44:56.863 --> 45:01.032
Because, uh,
a degree is like magic.

45:01.034 --> 45:03.334
You still do your job,
but when you have a degree,

45:03.336 --> 45:05.870
people believe you know
what you're talking about.

45:05.872 --> 45:08.306
So, it's like
they can see you better?

45:08.308 --> 45:11.910
Yes, in fact.

45:11.912 --> 45:15.146
And it's why you two are
going to go to college one day,

45:15.148 --> 45:17.916
so people see you
right from the start.

45:17.918 --> 45:20.685
Will you still be
in college when we go there?

45:20.687 --> 45:23.021
At this rate, probably.

45:23.023 --> 45:25.256
Inferior vena cava.

45:25.258 --> 45:26.978
Good job, mom.

45:29.495 --> 45:31.062
I'm glad you came back,

45:31.064 --> 45:33.364
although I thought these
earrings were for your wife.

45:33.366 --> 45:35.733
My wife doesn't
appreciate my gifts anymore.

45:35.735 --> 45:38.369
That's just wrong...

45:38.371 --> 45:44.008
A man so romantic and generous.

45:44.010 --> 45:46.601
You know, when you slipped
that ring on my finger today...

45:47.547 --> 45:49.848
...My stomach got
that roller-coaster feeling.

45:49.850 --> 45:52.350
- You know why?
- Why?

45:52.352 --> 45:56.654
Because that moment,
that is the moment.

45:56.656 --> 46:00.992
That is the moment
when everything is good.

46:08.434 --> 46:10.333
Half-day?

46:12.071 --> 46:14.539
Uh, for us both, it seems.

46:14.541 --> 46:18.142
How are you progressing
with the sex study?

46:18.144 --> 46:20.178
Very well.

46:21.348 --> 46:24.750
We've amassed an unprecedented
amount of data.

46:24.751 --> 46:27.018
We've killed a few sacred cows
along the way.

46:27.020 --> 46:29.220
We've opened up many new doors.
It's, uh...

46:29.222 --> 46:30.889
Well, it's ground-breaking work.

46:30.891 --> 46:34.058
I think a presentation
is not too far in the future.

46:34.060 --> 46:36.527
I look forward to it.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.935
Have you come across
any information

46:43.937 --> 46:47.805
about people's abilities
to change their sexual habits?

46:47.807 --> 46:50.808
- I-I only ask...
- I know why you're asking.

46:52.244 --> 46:55.046
Uh, I've run across
a few treatments.

46:55.048 --> 46:57.548
Uh, I can't verify they work.

46:57.550 --> 46:59.651
I've also been
doing some reading.

46:59.653 --> 47:03.554
Apparently, there's, uh...
Aversion therapy...

47:03.556 --> 47:07.438
- And electroshock.
- Jesus, Barton.

47:07.994 --> 47:10.261
Wha...

47:13.700 --> 47:17.368
I do know a psychologist
in New York, Dr. Sandor Rado.

47:17.370 --> 47:19.938
He's been touting
something he calls

47:19.940 --> 47:22.573
"Adaptational Psychodynamics."

47:24.811 --> 47:28.179
Sounds like something
Pavlov did to dogs.

47:28.181 --> 47:32.016
It's a form of aversion therapy.

47:32.018 --> 47:34.519
Patient's given a drug...
Apomorphine.

47:34.521 --> 47:36.821
It induces nausea
while the patient engages

47:36.823 --> 47:39.991
in the behavior
that he wishes to change.

47:39.993 --> 47:45.299
The hope is the brain rewires itself
to perceive the activity it used to enjoy

47:45.300 --> 47:48.900
as, uh... repulsive.

47:51.770 --> 47:54.272
I wish I could be of more help.

47:56.475 --> 47:59.010
You're standing here.

47:59.012 --> 48:01.279
That's enough.

48:10.568 --> 48:12.890
Dr. DePaul,
if I can bend your ear?

48:12.892 --> 48:16.361
Are you ready to hatch a plan
to raid the hospital's coffers?

48:16.363 --> 48:18.629
It's about, uh,
a smaller matter.

48:18.631 --> 48:21.065
Uh, Mrs. Johnson
might come to you

48:21.067 --> 48:23.468
to, uh, sign up
for another class.

48:23.470 --> 48:27.138
Um, I would appreciate it if
you would tell me if she does.

48:28.007 --> 48:30.575
You can't ask her yourself?

48:35.981 --> 48:40.651
Mrs. Johnson has a tendency
to overfill her plate.

48:40.653 --> 48:43.488
Her work on the study
is time-consuming...

48:43.490 --> 48:45.823
Uh, important.

48:45.825 --> 48:48.493
Her course work
is getting in the way?

48:48.495 --> 48:51.829
Well, the study
needs to be a priority.

48:51.831 --> 48:54.832
Because if she did manage
to stand on her own two feet,

48:54.834 --> 48:57.502
that would mean
she could walk away.

48:59.171 --> 49:00.838
Fine.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.041
You help me, I'll help you.

49:11.083 --> 49:13.724
Save my spot, will you?

49:15.296 --> 49:16.654
I have a little something
I want to...

49:16.656 --> 49:18.389
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

49:18.391 --> 49:20.591
How do you feel about German?

49:20.593 --> 49:22.693
The language?

49:22.695 --> 49:24.495
Good housekeeping
has a <i>schnitzel</i> recipe

49:24.497 --> 49:26.697
that I thought I could come
around and cook for you tonight.

49:26.699 --> 49:28.633
Actually, I have plans tonight.

49:28.635 --> 49:31.969
And so do you. I'm taking
you out, someplace special.

49:32.217 --> 49:35.686
- Where are we going?
- Top secret. Wear a dress.

49:35.688 --> 49:37.854
Ooh, tea length or floor length?

49:37.856 --> 49:39.323
Surprise me.

49:39.325 --> 49:41.325
But is the restaurant
formal? Should I wear gloves?

49:41.327 --> 49:43.360
- It's Delmonico’s.
- Delmonico's?!

49:43.362 --> 49:45.562
My cousin Frances went to
Delmonico’s with a boyfriend,

49:45.564 --> 49:48.198
and she came back with a fiancé.

49:48.200 --> 49:49.766
Really?!

49:49.768 --> 49:51.902
All the girls in the dorm
call it "The Hitching Post."

49:51.904 --> 49:54.938
Should I be getting a manicure
or something to show off tomorrow?

49:56.574 --> 49:57.808
A manicure is never a bad idea.

49:57.810 --> 49:59.376
Is it a brilliant cut
or an emerald cut?

49:59.378 --> 50:00.644
- The diamond.
- I-I don't know.

50:00.646 --> 50:02.612
W-well, they're
completely different styles.

50:02.614 --> 50:03.814
One's round.
The other's rectangular.

50:03.816 --> 50:06.816
- I-I think it's kind of football shaped.
- A marquise cut?

50:07.585 --> 50:08.852
I suppose I'd have to look.

50:10.789 --> 50:12.989
Yes! Yes, I'll marry you!

50:15.260 --> 50:18.362
Oh, my God!
I have to call my mother!

50:18.364 --> 50:20.931
Hey, doc. You're up.

50:32.944 --> 50:34.378
Dr. Langham.

50:34.380 --> 50:36.713
I was wondering if a new bone
disease had been discovered,

50:36.715 --> 50:37.948
we hadn't seen you in so long.

50:37.950 --> 50:40.016
I want back in the study.

50:40.018 --> 50:42.719
That, um... issue

50:42.721 --> 50:46.890
I was dealing with that time before,
it's no longer an issue.

50:46.892 --> 50:49.626
Oh, meaning you want
back in the study with Jane?

50:49.628 --> 50:52.696
It doesn't have to be Jane.
No, you and Bill have a study to run.

50:52.698 --> 50:54.197
I understand that.

50:54.199 --> 50:55.632
Whoever you want to
put me with is fine.

50:55.634 --> 50:58.068
In fact, I'm open
to anyone, everyone.

50:58.070 --> 51:00.036
I know it's all
in the service to science.

51:00.038 --> 51:01.505
Right.

51:01.507 --> 51:04.574
Well, yeah, we could always
use good subjects.

51:04.576 --> 51:07.913
I'm better than good.
I'm back. Excuse me.

51:08.258 --> 51:10.358
Then I'll sign you up.

51:16.219 --> 51:18.789
One of the perks
of being a doctor...

51:18.791 --> 51:21.958
I can let myself into
the dispensary anytime I want.

51:21.960 --> 51:24.928
- But the point of this drug...
- Apomorphine.

51:24.930 --> 51:26.797
...Is to make you sick?

51:27.800 --> 51:32.769
I take it, and you...
Pleasure yourself.

51:32.771 --> 51:34.137
Maybe just sit there.

51:34.139 --> 51:36.773
Point is, I look at you,
I get sick,

51:36.775 --> 51:41.111
and then I'm cured
of this terrible habit.

51:42.280 --> 51:45.005
I don't know.
It doesn't seem right.

51:45.617 --> 51:47.350
I'm paying you.

51:48.553 --> 51:50.153
I don't think that's the point!

51:50.155 --> 51:52.756
It <i>is</i> the point.
It's why you're here, isn't it?

51:52.758 --> 51:56.693
If I stopped paying, it's not
as if you'd ask to see me again.

51:56.695 --> 51:59.332
- I like your company.
- Oh, don't hustle me.

52:00.398 --> 52:01.731
Who says it's a hustle?

52:01.733 --> 52:03.967
Because there is
no universe where you and I

52:03.969 --> 52:07.537
are anything other
than a business transaction!

52:15.079 --> 52:17.481
I'll pay you double...

52:17.483 --> 52:21.184
Triple, whatever you want.

52:21.186 --> 52:22.919
Don't make me beg for this.

52:25.691 --> 52:28.959
I'm just trying to picture it.

52:28.961 --> 52:31.561
I sit across from you,
and you vomit.

52:32.798 --> 52:36.266
Hell, if I wanted that reaction, I could
just go home and visit my parents.

52:42.673 --> 52:44.841
I'm not proud of this!

52:44.843 --> 52:46.977
I mean...

52:46.979 --> 52:49.279
Do I look in the mirror and
wish that I was someone else?

52:49.281 --> 52:52.349
Maybe once a day.
But then I think...

52:52.351 --> 52:54.384
Fuck them.

52:54.386 --> 52:56.686
I mean it. Fuck them!

52:56.688 --> 52:59.689
Don't be a child.

52:59.691 --> 53:04.327
Because I'm the one cowering
in a dark room like a baby?

53:04.329 --> 53:05.896
No.

53:07.498 --> 53:11.358
There's only one person
that gets to be sickened by me.

53:12.771 --> 53:15.171
And that's me.

53:16.807 --> 53:18.174
Everybody else...

53:20.211 --> 53:22.746
...They can go fuck themselves.

53:31.455 --> 53:34.457
You should change your mind.

53:37.215 --> 53:40.284
When you do,
you know where to find me.

54:16.055 --> 54:19.990
Look at this. Somebody's
gonna have to give <i>me</i> lessons.

54:19.992 --> 54:21.625
I hope my wife is watching,

54:21.627 --> 54:25.463
because she would be proud
of this tango.

54:25.465 --> 54:29.600
You know, I heard somewhere your feet can
cover five miles in a night of dancing.

54:29.602 --> 54:34.872
And I figured my wife and I must have
danced the tango from here to Zanzibar.

54:34.874 --> 54:37.541
What a lovely story.

54:42.448 --> 54:44.348
Mrs. Masters?

54:44.350 --> 54:46.050
Mrs. Masters?!

54:50.322 --> 54:53.657
- You're sure I can't call your husband?
- Oh, I feel fine.

54:53.659 --> 54:56.741
And I don't want to worry him
till we know what's going on.

54:57.662 --> 55:00.831
You were so good to bring me, Walter,
but y-you don't have to stay.

55:00.833 --> 55:02.700
I don't have anywhere to be.

55:04.202 --> 55:07.037
Mrs. Masters? I'll be quick.

55:07.039 --> 55:09.740
You can have your boy
bring the car around.

55:09.742 --> 55:12.109
Oh, he's not my boy,
he's, um...

55:14.012 --> 55:16.286
Uh, he's the handyman.

55:18.016 --> 55:20.084
I'll wait outside.

55:21.219 --> 55:23.187
Well, I think
we found our culprit.

55:23.189 --> 55:25.649
Your blood pressure is 100/65.

55:25.650 --> 55:27.024
That's very low.

55:27.026 --> 55:30.461
Yes, but a little hypotension
is nothing to fret about.

55:30.463 --> 55:31.663
It's your hormones.

55:31.664 --> 55:34.131
They cause your blood vessels
to widen,

55:34.133 --> 55:36.033
increase the blood flow
to the baby.

55:36.158 --> 55:37.691
To the...

55:37.693 --> 55:40.193
We see it all the time
in the first trimester.

55:40.195 --> 55:41.628
It's harmless.

55:41.630 --> 55:43.063
So long as you don't get
too dizzy,

55:43.065 --> 55:45.666
your pregnancy should proceed
without any problems at all.

56:28.843 --> 56:30.777
How did your exam go?

56:30.779 --> 56:34.081
I have no idea.

56:34.083 --> 56:38.318
You should see
the other students in the class.

56:38.320 --> 56:42.189
I am quite the outsider
in that world.

56:42.191 --> 56:44.691
In many worlds, I suppose.

56:45.927 --> 56:47.127
Not here.

56:56.971 --> 57:00.374
I'm not even sure
I'll keep taking classes.

57:00.376 --> 57:03.577
We're plenty busy here.

57:03.579 --> 57:08.348
Well, whatever you decide.
It's up to you.

57:21.729 --> 57:26.299
I thought you disabled
the vibrating function.

57:26.301 --> 57:28.201
I did.
That's Lester's hands shaking.

57:30.673 --> 57:33.540
Well, in his defense,
I don't think he's ever seen

57:33.542 --> 57:36.476
the outside of a vagina,
let alone the inside of one.

57:45.920 --> 57:48.755
I think that's
the refractory period ending.

57:49.339 --> 57:53.596
The time between resolution
and secondary arousal...

57:53.829 --> 57:56.530
13 minutes, 3 seconds.

57:57.965 --> 58:01.168
I cannot believe
you find this footage arousing.

58:01.170 --> 58:03.704
No, it's not the footage.

58:03.706 --> 58:06.840
It's the fact that we're
the only two people in the world

58:06.842 --> 58:09.443
who've seen it.
