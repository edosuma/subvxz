00:40.863 --> 00:44.142
<i>So long, child</i>

00:44.242 --> 00:48.522
<i>I'm on my way</i>

00:49.413 --> 00:52.366
<i>And after all is done</i>

00:54.294 --> 00:57.448
<i>After all is done</i>

00:58.256 --> 01:01.791
<i>Don't be down</i>

01:02.595 --> 01:06.626
<i>It's all in the past</i>

01:07.224 --> 01:13.759
<i>Though you may be afraid</i>

01:16.483 --> 01:20.516
<i>So long, child</i>

01:21.197 --> 01:24.849
<i>It's awful dark</i>

01:25.493 --> 01:28.647
<i>And I've never felt the sun</i>

01:29.623 --> 01:32.907
<i>I dread to think of when</i>

01:33.626 --> 01:35.451
<i>When the wind blows</i>

01:38.089 --> 01:39.950
<i>When the wind blows</i>

01:42.511 --> 01:44.619
<i>When the wind blows</i>

01:47.099 --> 01:52.755
<i>When the wind blows</i>

01:52.855 --> 01:56.926
<i>Life burns a savage wound</i>

01:57.026 --> 02:00.809
<i>Angry and wrong</i>

02:01.655 --> 02:05.685
<i>Trusting a twisted word</i>

02:05.785 --> 02:09.898
<i>You'll run, run away</i>

02:09.997 --> 02:13.282
<i>You'll take him home</i>

02:14.252 --> 02:17.952
<i>You'll spit and taunt him</i>

02:18.674 --> 02:22.201
<i>But they won't believe you</i>

02:22.301 --> 02:26.796
<i>No matter what you say</i>

02:29.851 --> 02:33.420
<i>So long, child</i>

02:34.023 --> 02:37.010
<i>It's awful dark</i>

02:37.860 --> 02:40.971
<i>I've never felt the sun</i>

02:41.071 --> 02:49.445
<i>I dread to think of
when the wind blows</i>

02:50.665 --> 02:53.616
<i>When the wind blows</i>

02:55.086 --> 02:57.527
<i>When the wind blows</i>

02:59.340 --> 03:10.122
<i>When the wind blows</i>

03:33.984 --> 03:36.178
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, love.

03:36.278 --> 03:40.224
- Did you have a nice morning, dear?
- Oh, all right, thanks.

03:40.324 --> 03:42.351
Rather uneventful.

03:42.451 --> 03:45.645
My life isn't very
fast-moving or dynamic.

03:45.745 --> 03:48.520
Well, you are retired, James.

03:54.755 --> 03:56.782
You do seem a bit down, dear.

03:56.882 --> 04:01.120
Yes, well... I've been reading the papers
in the public library all the morning.

04:01.220 --> 04:06.542
Oh, those things! Full of rubbish.
I never look at them. Except the stars.

04:06.642 --> 04:10.339
We must keep abreast of the
international situation, ducksie.

04:10.439 --> 04:14.551
Decisions made by the powers
that be will get to us in the end.

04:14.651 --> 04:18.014
Politics and sport,
that's all they're full of.

04:18.113 --> 04:21.930
Could affect us all, the...
ultimate determent, an' that.

04:22.826 --> 04:26.188
They say there may be a
pre-emptive strike, dear.

04:26.288 --> 04:28.315
Oh, not another strike!

04:28.415 --> 04:32.361
It's wicked! I'd have them all
locked up. Blessed communists!

04:32.461 --> 04:34.696
Well, it all looks pretty umpty.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.283
It's not that sort of strike, duck.

04:37.383 --> 04:41.497
- Sausages or beefburgers, dear?
- Sausages, thanks.

04:42.513 --> 04:46.500
It looks as if the balloon
could go up at any moment.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.627
What balloon?

04:48.727 --> 04:51.214
- Mashed or chips?
- Chips, thanks.

04:51.314 --> 04:53.341
Oh, I don't know.

04:53.441 --> 04:55.218
The balloon.

04:55.318 --> 04:58.721
Or is it a maroon? I can't remember.

04:58.821 --> 05:02.022
What are you talking about, James?

05:03.410 --> 05:06.148
It looks as if there's
going to be a war, dear.

05:07.998 --> 05:11.735
Yes, they say it might
break out at any time now.

05:11.835 --> 05:15.489
Well, at least you won't be
called up, James. You're far too old.

05:15.589 --> 05:19.618
Well, thank you, my beloved.
I'm still two years younger than you.

05:19.718 --> 05:21.537
Well, if the worst
comes to the worst,

05:21.637 --> 05:24.958
we'll just have to roll up
our sleeves, tighten our belts,

05:25.058 --> 05:28.419
and put on our tin hats
till it's V-E Day again.

05:28.519 --> 05:30.629
It won't be like
that this time, love.

05:30.729 --> 05:34.162
I think this one is called
the "Big Bang Theory."

05:34.263 --> 05:36.302
It's all worked out by
brilliant scientists.

05:36.402 --> 05:39.097
Well, we survived the last one,
we can do it again.

05:39.197 --> 05:41.809
It'll take more than a few
bombs to get me down.

05:41.909 --> 05:46.651
Yes, yes, we... we must...
must look on the bright side, ducks.

05:48.707 --> 05:52.235
- Better go over to Radio 4.
- I like Radio 2.

05:52.335 --> 05:56.406
Radio 4 is better for the
international situation.

05:56.506 --> 06:01.453
Good evening, this is Radio 4, with the
news at six o'clock this Thursday evening.

06:01.553 --> 06:05.624
The Prime Minister, speaking a few
minutes ago in the House of Commons,

06:05.724 --> 06:09.963
has warned that the international
situation is deteriorating rapidly,

06:10.063 --> 06:14.133
and that war could break out at any
time in the next two or three days.

06:14.233 --> 06:15.801
Crumbs!

06:15.901 --> 06:18.471
What's the matter, dear?
Have you burned yourself?

06:18.571 --> 06:21.474
This is it, ducks! This is really it!

06:21.574 --> 06:23.810
Another sausage, dear?

06:23.910 --> 06:27.480
I shouldn't worry too much.
It'll probably all blow over.

06:27.580 --> 06:33.486
- Three days! Blimey! Three days!
- Language, James! Language!

06:33.586 --> 06:38.325
Crumbs! It's lucky I got more leaflets
from the public library only this morning.

06:38.425 --> 06:39.993
Here we are, see?

06:40.093 --> 06:44.706
"Protect And Survive" and...
"The Householder's Guide To Survival."

06:44.806 --> 06:47.167
Now, this one should
be really authoritative.

06:47.267 --> 06:49.086
It's printed by the County Council.

06:49.186 --> 06:52.840
We'd better commence the construction
of a fallout shelter immediately.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.508
We must do the correct thing.

06:54.608 --> 06:58.179
There's treacle tart and custard
or cold bread and butter pudding.

06:58.279 --> 07:01.181
-  Treacle tart, please.
- Fallout?

07:01.281 --> 07:04.839
- I thought they did that in the army.
- No, dear, it's fall in in the army.

07:04.940 --> 07:09.315
Fall in. Thank goodness I got
all those official leaflets today.

07:09.415 --> 07:11.192
I gave the others to our Ron.

07:11.292 --> 07:13.531
Suppose I hadn't?

07:14.629 --> 07:17.531
We'd have been totally non-prepared.
I mean, just think!

07:17.631 --> 07:22.329
Will you have to dig a hole, like the
old Anderson shelters in the war?

07:22.429 --> 07:24.206
No, dear, that's all old-fashioned.

07:24.306 --> 07:28.418
With modern scientific methods, you just
use doors with cushions and books on top.

07:28.518 --> 07:31.546
Where on earth are we going
to get doors from, James?

07:31.646 --> 07:34.216
Well... you just
unscrew them, dear.

07:34.316 --> 07:37.089
You don't mean off our own house!

07:37.904 --> 07:40.807
Well... yes... dear.

07:40.907 --> 07:43.059
You're not going to ruin
the paintwork, James!

07:43.160 --> 07:47.063
Oh, don't worry. I can soon touch
it up after the bomb's gone off.

07:47.163 --> 07:49.402
Well, mind you do.

08:00.635 --> 08:03.408
Just you be careful, James!

08:16.568 --> 08:19.057
Mind that paint, James!

08:27.955 --> 08:30.194
I hope you know what you're doing.

08:32.001 --> 08:35.984
I'll put the screws in a plastic bag.
You'll only go and lose them.

08:36.712 --> 08:40.080
Remember, they're in the
right-hand jug on the dresser.

09:54.045 --> 09:57.530
It's going to be very
draughty with no doors on.

09:58.424 --> 10:01.160
I expect it's a safety precaution.

10:01.260 --> 10:04.876
It'll let the...
blast go straight through.

10:06.181 --> 10:08.001
It says here...

10:08.101 --> 10:15.425
"The inner core or refuge should be placed at
an angle of 60 degrees for maximum strength."

10:15.525 --> 10:18.428
I should place it up against
the wall, if I were you, dear.

10:18.528 --> 10:20.096
Yes, but which are the degrees?

10:20.196 --> 10:22.223
We haven't got any angles.

10:22.323 --> 10:26.435
I think we did it at school. You...
You had angles with degrees in.

10:26.535 --> 10:30.437
Only I can't remember.
I think I'll ring our Ron. He'll know.

10:44.054 --> 10:46.957
Hello, son. All right?
Beryl and the baby?

10:47.057 --> 10:51.879
Good. Look, I'm building this
governmental inner core or refuge,

10:51.979 --> 10:55.841
and it says, "Place it at
an angle of 60 degrees."

10:55.941 --> 10:58.181
Well, what's that mean, exactly?

10:59.320 --> 11:01.807
It's not cobblers, son.

11:01.907 --> 11:04.561
It's in the governmental directive.

11:05.576 --> 11:08.480
You mean you're not constructing
an inner core or refuge?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.523
I gave you the leaflets especially!

11:11.416 --> 11:13.240
But what about baby Jim?

11:14.836 --> 11:16.487
Don't start singing!

11:16.587 --> 11:20.406
What do you mean, "We'll all go
together when we go"? It's not funny.

11:21.301 --> 11:26.708
No, but it's our duty to carry out
governmental instructions in time of war, son.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.878
Stop laughing, will you?
I'm surprised at you.

11:30.978 --> 11:34.048
You're supposed to be a
responsible father now.

11:35.274 --> 11:38.344
A protractor?
The angle at the bottom?

11:39.611 --> 11:41.638
Yes, yes, I see.

11:41.738 --> 11:43.348
OK, son. Thanks.

11:43.448 --> 11:44.851
Now, listen.

11:44.951 --> 11:49.279
Just you start that inner core or refuge.
It's your bounden duty, son.

11:50.039 --> 11:51.732
Cheerio, son.

11:51.832 --> 11:53.861
Now, remember what I said.

11:53.961 --> 11:56.733
I am your father.
I do know a bit about war.

11:58.298 --> 12:01.119
Love to Beryl and baby Jim. Ta-ta.

12:02.594 --> 12:07.540
Yes... Ron says I need a protractor.
He says I can get one at Willis's.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.836
He was killing himself laughing,
and he was singing songs!

12:10.936 --> 12:13.379
I can't understand it.
I think it's nerves.

12:13.479 --> 12:15.548
He's gone a bit hysterical.

12:15.648 --> 12:18.927
- He can't be drunk at this time of day.
- Our Ron doesn't drink.

12:19.027 --> 12:23.095
Oh, no, no, no. No, no,
of course not, dear.

12:23.908 --> 12:27.144
Ron is not going to make
an inner core or refuge.

12:27.244 --> 12:29.897
I remonstrated with him,
but he was adamant.

12:29.997 --> 12:33.234
He says if London cops it, he'll cop it.
And not to worry, Dad.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.361
It's an irresponsible attitude.

12:35.461 --> 12:38.656
I'm a bit disappointed in him,
adopting that attitude.

12:38.756 --> 12:43.578
He was always a very responsible
boy when he was in the Cubs.

12:43.678 --> 12:47.413
It was going to that art
college that spoiled him.

12:48.307 --> 12:50.334
He met some dreadful people there.

12:50.434 --> 12:53.470
Huh! Blessed beatniks!

12:54.398 --> 12:59.343
I don't suppose it'll make a terrific
amount of difference, the exact angle.

13:00.236 --> 13:04.265
It'll probably all fall down anyway.
What with the bomb, an' that.

13:04.365 --> 13:07.602
If a job's worth doing,
it's worth doing well, James.

13:07.702 --> 13:10.940
Yes, dear. But it is only temporary.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.990
After all, it'll all
be over in a flash.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.221
Funny to think they were
on our side in the war.

13:25.321 --> 13:27.348
- Who, dear?
- The Russkies.

13:27.448 --> 13:31.853
- With old Joe Stalin.
- Yes, he was a nice chap.

13:31.953 --> 13:33.981
I liked him.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.108
Like an uncle, he was.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.568
I liked his moustache and his pipe.

13:38.668 --> 13:42.114
Yeah. Roosevelt was nice, too.

13:42.214 --> 13:43.782
There was three of them.

13:43.882 --> 13:47.995
Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.122
All good blokes.

13:50.222 --> 13:56.711
With old Hitler, Goering and Musso,
and all that lot, on the other side.

14:00.357 --> 14:02.680
You somehow knew where you were then.

14:03.569 --> 14:05.888
I don't even know who the
people are these days.

14:05.988 --> 14:08.933
I expect it's all done
by committees, dear.

14:09.033 --> 14:13.104
Yes, and meetings. I expect they
have loads and loads of meetings,

14:13.204 --> 14:15.443
and thus arrive at decisions.

14:15.999 --> 14:17.442
Commuters, too.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.569
They all use commuters these days.

14:19.669 --> 14:22.030
It's got very impersonal.

14:22.130 --> 14:26.660
Churchill with his cigar,
old Stalin with his moustache...

14:26.760 --> 14:28.787
you knew where you stood.

14:28.887 --> 14:30.956
Do you think they'll invade?

14:31.056 --> 14:33.542
Oh, no, no. Won't need to.

14:33.642 --> 14:35.669
It'll all be done by missiles.

14:35.769 --> 14:37.796
Long... range.

14:37.896 --> 14:40.967
Then they'll instil commuters
to take charge of us.

14:41.067 --> 14:44.681
It's funny to think there's
no shelters this time.

14:45.571 --> 14:47.598
We had an old Anderson in the garden.

14:47.698 --> 14:49.518
I can see it now.

14:49.618 --> 14:52.269
We had nasturtiums
growing all over it.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.609
And we painted the front green.

14:55.915 --> 14:57.907
Painted, it looked quite pretty.

14:58.751 --> 15:00.862
Next door grew cabbages on theirs.

15:00.962 --> 15:02.989
Yes. We had a Morrison.

15:03.089 --> 15:05.908
Hm, I used to sleep in it.

15:06.008 --> 15:08.495
I stuck pin-up girls
all over the inside.

15:08.595 --> 15:11.873
Betty Grable,
Anne Shelton, Patricia Roc.

15:11.973 --> 15:15.673
The roof got all smoky, cos I used
to read in bed with a candle.

15:16.728 --> 15:20.090
Yes, it was nice in the war, really.

15:20.190 --> 15:24.470
The shelters, the blackouts,
cups of tea...

15:24.570 --> 15:27.389
The ARP, the evacuees.

15:27.489 --> 15:30.602
London kids seeing
cows for the first time.

15:30.702 --> 15:33.270
Old Churchill on the wireless.

15:33.370 --> 15:35.105
The nine o'clock news.

15:35.205 --> 15:39.569
- Vera Lynn singing away.
- Worker's Playtime.

15:39.669 --> 15:43.534
Spitfires and Hurricanes in the
blue sky over the cornfields.

15:44.924 --> 15:47.452
The White Cliffs of Dover.

15:47.552 --> 15:50.243
Old Jerry coming over every night.

15:50.972 --> 15:53.710
Those were the days.

15:58.564 --> 16:02.463
Don't you dare use my best
cushions from the front room!

16:03.484 --> 16:06.180
I'll get some old ones from upstairs.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.519
I'll put them in plastic bags.

16:09.408 --> 16:12.394
I don't want fingermarks
getting all over them.

16:12.494 --> 16:14.062
I shouldn't worry too much, love.

16:14.162 --> 16:17.281
They're bound to get dusty with
all the fallout coming down.

16:18.542 --> 16:23.739
It says here we've got to lay
in food supplies for 14 days.

16:23.839 --> 16:26.701
I'd better put a note out
for 28 pints of milk, then.

16:26.801 --> 16:31.046
I'll just pop out and get 14 loaves,
dear! And a protractor.

16:32.515 --> 16:34.755
Anything else you want?

16:36.018 --> 16:38.626
I'll need more plastic bags, dear!

16:52.536 --> 16:54.814
There's no bread, ducks! Sold out.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.441
There seems to be some
sort of panic purchasing.

16:57.541 --> 16:59.568
It can't be helped, dear.

16:59.668 --> 17:01.695
After all, there is a war on.

17:01.795 --> 17:04.035
Or nearly, anyway.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.909
I hope you haven't left that cape
dripping in the hall, James!

17:08.009 --> 17:09.787
Oh, no, dear.

17:09.887 --> 17:14.832
Mr Willis has sold out of protractors.
I expect everyone wants 60 degrees.

17:15.559 --> 17:17.377
He was terrifically kind, Mr Willis.

17:17.478 --> 17:20.464
He cut me out a bit of card
with 60 degrees on it. Look.

17:20.565 --> 17:22.340
Oh! Nice, dear.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.678
Here's the emergency supplies, ducks.

17:24.778 --> 17:27.931
Two packets of ginger creams,
half a jam sponge,

17:28.031 --> 17:31.142
a tin of pineapple chunks
and a tin of Christmas pud.

17:31.242 --> 17:33.600
It'll all be over by Christmas.

17:36.039 --> 17:41.320
- You're not decorating now, James!
- We've got to paint the windows white, dear.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.532
- Whatever for?
- It's for the radiation, I think.

17:44.632 --> 17:49.412
Like they do in greenhouses, to keep
out the sun. It's the correct thing.

17:49.512 --> 17:53.416
- It won't be that hot, surely!
- Well, I don't know.

17:53.516 --> 17:58.128
They say the one at Hiroshima
was equal to one thousand suns.

17:58.228 --> 18:00.089
So it is quite hot.

18:00.189 --> 18:04.301
And besides, the powers that be
are making much better ones now.

18:04.401 --> 18:09.098
Science has leaped forward
with giant strides. Oops!

18:09.198 --> 18:11.768
Mind you don't get paint
on those curtains, James.

18:11.868 --> 18:14.986
You should have taken them
down first. You never think.

18:15.872 --> 18:18.112
I know that smile of yours, James.

18:22.963 --> 18:27.374
"Keep doors closed to prevent
the spread of fire", it says.

18:28.259 --> 18:31.539
- But you've taken off half the doors, James.
- Yes, dear.

18:31.639 --> 18:33.749
Won't that make the fire worse, then?

18:35.225 --> 18:37.127
Well, I...

18:37.227 --> 18:39.753
Perhaps the blast will
blow the fire out.

18:41.189 --> 18:43.426
Well... Hm!

18:43.526 --> 18:47.138
The inner core or refuge looks
quite cosy, doesn't it, dear?

18:47.238 --> 18:51.142
I hope those doors aren't
marking the wallpaper, James.

18:51.242 --> 18:54.016
Come in and try it out, dear. Please.

18:59.918 --> 19:03.029
Whoa! Careful! Careful!
You'll have it over!

19:03.129 --> 19:05.574
Budge up, can't you, James?

19:05.674 --> 19:09.828
Couldn't you have
made it a bit... wider?

19:09.928 --> 19:16.168
It's... It's constructed in compliance
with the governmental specifications, dear.

19:16.268 --> 19:19.379
Well, they might have made it
wide enough for two people.

19:19.479 --> 19:22.257
- Suppose you were married?
- We are married, dear.

19:22.357 --> 19:24.301
Yes, well there you are, then.

19:25.694 --> 19:27.721
Oh!

19:27.821 --> 19:31.350
What about if you had children?
Where would they go?

19:31.450 --> 19:36.146
Oh, well, you'd just hold them in
your arms. They'd soon fall asleep.

19:36.246 --> 19:38.608
Suppose they were 17 or 18?

19:38.708 --> 19:42.820
Big boys with bristly chins
and big boots on. Skinheads.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.115
Well, in that case, you'd...

19:46.215 --> 19:48.367
just add a few more doors.

19:48.467 --> 19:52.204
There's... no wall
space for more doors.

19:52.304 --> 19:54.331
Oh. No.

19:54.431 --> 19:58.416
Well, our Ron was never
a skinhead, anyway.

20:00.815 --> 20:03.383
What on earth are you putting
the food in there for?

20:03.483 --> 20:05.511
Well, that's where it's got to be.

20:05.611 --> 20:08.639
But why can't it stay in
the larder and fridge?

20:08.739 --> 20:13.060
Because we must not emerge for the
14 days of the national emergency.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.980
You're not saying we've got to stay
in that thing for two weeks, are you?

20:17.080 --> 20:19.775
Yes, dear. Ours not to reason why.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.903
Now we must do the correct thing.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.030
Well, what about the cooking, then?

20:24.130 --> 20:25.740
How do I get to the cooker?

20:25.840 --> 20:28.826
We'll just have to use the
little picnic stove, dear.

20:28.926 --> 20:31.621
- What about the toilet?
- Well...

20:31.721 --> 20:34.373
Well, we'll have to have
a potty, or something.

20:34.473 --> 20:37.126
I can tell you now, James Bloggs,

20:37.226 --> 20:40.755
that I am going to go upstairs
in the proper manner.

20:40.855 --> 20:45.511
But you mustn't emerge, dear. Not for
the 14 days of the national emergency.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.430
All right, then, how are you
going to empty the chamber pot?

20:48.530 --> 20:52.100
Well, we just have to empty
it down the toilet, I suppose.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.228
- You just said we couldn't go to the toilet.
- Oh. Yes.

20:55.328 --> 20:56.938
Well... Yeah, well,

20:57.038 --> 21:00.151
Now, we'd better not cross our
bridges till we come to them, eh?

21:00.251 --> 21:03.321
Look on the bright side, eh, ducks?

21:03.754 --> 21:08.913
Six, five, zero, zero, six, ten...

21:10.803 --> 21:15.708
It says here, "Two pints of
water per person per day."

21:15.808 --> 21:18.377
I wonder if we've got enough bottles.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.920
I'll have a look under
the stairs, dear.

21:31.616 --> 21:34.394
I've measured the water
into the bottles, James.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.063
I've labelled them so we
don't get in a muddle.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.190
Oh, good. That's nice, dear.

21:39.290 --> 21:42.402
You're very efficient in a
national emergency, dearest.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.743
Get on with you!

21:46.591 --> 21:49.577
It says here, "D: Miscellaneous:

21:49.677 --> 21:52.497
Salt, tomato ketchup and sauces,

21:52.597 --> 21:58.085
pepper, matches, toilet paper,
disinfectant, vitamin tablets,

21:58.185 --> 22:01.297
tin opener, knives, forks, spoons."

22:01.397 --> 22:04.348
Funny. No plates.

22:08.780 --> 22:11.015
- What's all that, dear?
- I don't know.

22:11.115 --> 22:14.684
It's called "miscellaneous."
Pass it in, please.

22:15.537 --> 22:17.777
- Funny.
- What, dear?

22:18.456 --> 22:23.612
In the governmental leaflet, it says,
"Remove thin materials from windows."

22:23.712 --> 22:28.534
And in the County Council leaflet, it says,
"Hang white sheets in the windows."

22:28.634 --> 22:30.411
I wonder which is correct.

22:30.511 --> 22:33.079
Oh! It says peanut butter.

22:33.179 --> 22:36.250
We haven't got any. Oh, dear.

22:36.350 --> 22:38.918
Never mind, ducks.
I don't like it, nor do you.

22:39.019 --> 22:42.840
No, but it's on the official list.
Oh, dear.

22:42.940 --> 22:44.967
Now, don't worry, love.

22:45.067 --> 22:47.095
I expect we'll survive without it.

22:47.195 --> 22:49.932
It'll probably go runny
in the heat, anyway.

22:50.865 --> 22:53.518
You get terrific heat with
these bombs, you know.

22:53.618 --> 22:57.146
Mind you, diet is very important.

22:57.246 --> 23:00.734
You are what you... eat.

23:00.834 --> 23:04.533
And the survival of
the fittest, an' that. Whoa!

23:05.421 --> 23:10.868
That's why so many people... are jogging
and eating lots of All-Bran, I expect.

23:10.968 --> 23:15.712
Only the fittest will survive the
outcome of the nuclear holocaust.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.168
They eat lots of beans, too.

23:18.268 --> 23:20.295
They give you wind, beans do.

23:20.395 --> 23:23.340
You certainly shouldn't
eat beans, James.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.468
Let's not get personal, ducks.

23:25.568 --> 23:28.722
I'm trying to have a
scientific discussion.

23:32.283 --> 23:37.187
If there really is going to be a war,
who do you think will win?

23:37.287 --> 23:41.316
Well, the Americans have
tactile nuclear superiority,

23:41.416 --> 23:44.904
due to their IBMs and
their polar submarines.

23:45.004 --> 23:47.824
But in the event of a
pre-emptive strike,

23:47.924 --> 23:53.245
innumerate Russian hordes will sweep
across the plains of Central Europe.

23:53.345 --> 23:56.332
Then the US Technical Air
Force will come roaring in

23:56.432 --> 24:02.172
with their Superhawks, B-17 s and B-19s,
bristling with guns! Terrifically armed!

24:02.272 --> 24:04.883
"OK, you guys! Let's go!"

24:04.983 --> 24:07.636
They'd razor the Russky
defences to the ground.

24:07.736 --> 24:11.223
Then the marines would parachute
in and round up the population.

24:11.323 --> 24:15.310
After that, the big generals would
go over... like... Ike and Monty.

24:15.410 --> 24:19.732
Then the Russians would capitulate,
and there would be a condition of surrender.

24:19.832 --> 24:22.985
Then they'd instil free
and fair elections.

24:23.085 --> 24:25.029
One man, one vote.

24:25.129 --> 24:27.239
And women too, nowadays, of course.

24:27.339 --> 24:31.243
And thus, the Communist threat to
the Free World would be neutrified,

24:31.343 --> 24:34.748
and democratic principles would
be instilled throughout Russia,

24:34.848 --> 24:36.416
whether they liked it or not.

24:36.516 --> 24:40.587
That's the world scenario as I
see it, at this moment in time.

24:40.687 --> 24:45.091
- Monty. Wasn't he in the war?
- Well, of course he was.

24:45.191 --> 24:46.927
He practically won it.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.054
You remember, dear.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.181
Big beret with badges on it.

24:51.281 --> 24:54.233
Tanks. The Desert Rats. El Alamo.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.941
But that was ages ago, dear.

25:00.041 --> 25:03.359
Yes, well, I expect
he's getting on a bit.

25:03.459 --> 25:05.488
Probably been promoted.

25:05.588 --> 25:06.989
More likely dead.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.701
Monty dead? Never!

25:09.801 --> 25:13.997
I'll bet he is. It's about
40 years since the war.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.336
And he had a moustache then!

25:17.225 --> 25:19.627
Who's in charge now, then?

25:19.727 --> 25:22.296
Oh, one of those commuters, I expect.

25:22.396 --> 25:26.718
It says here, "Place your
National Savings Certificates,

25:26.818 --> 25:29.930
medical cards and birth
certificates in a box."

25:30.030 --> 25:33.683
Here's a nice box, dear.
I'll give it a good clean-out.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.810
Oh, thanks.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.435
We'd... better keep
it in a safe place.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.988
I wonder what would be a safe place.

25:55.056 --> 25:57.625
Who's in charge of
the Russians, dear?

25:57.725 --> 25:59.752
Oh... it's...

25:59.852 --> 26:01.879
Shavinsky, isn't it?

26:01.979 --> 26:04.088
Or... Molotov.

26:05.149 --> 26:08.428
No. Molotov's just
a cocktail, I think.

26:08.528 --> 26:11.346
Krushef. Yes, that's right.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.474
B and K.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.685
Bulgania and Krushef, that's them.

26:15.785 --> 26:19.188
And that bloke Marx has got
something to do with it.

26:20.498 --> 26:23.026
What are you doing, dear?

26:23.126 --> 26:27.740
Blocking out the windows, in compliance
with the governmental directive.

26:28.633 --> 26:30.660
It's the correct thing.

26:30.760 --> 26:35.330
Yes. Then there's the...
usual committee, of course,

26:35.430 --> 26:39.043
the Common Term, they call it...
the Soviet Supreme.

26:39.143 --> 26:41.795
They're in charge of the BJ Kee.

26:41.895 --> 26:45.174
That's the Secret Service.
SS for short.

26:45.274 --> 26:48.051
Our lot is called EMI-5.

26:48.151 --> 26:50.722
Oh, it's all very complicated, ducks.

26:50.822 --> 26:53.892
Well, mind you don't
scratch the polish!

26:56.077 --> 26:59.355
Is it any good writing him
a letter, do you think?

26:59.455 --> 27:05.111
- Who, dear?
- This leader. BJ Whatshisname.

27:05.211 --> 27:08.449
- What are you going to say, dear?
- Oh, I don't know.

27:08.549 --> 27:11.494
Dear Sir,

27:11.594 --> 27:14.747
Mr B J thing...

27:14.847 --> 27:18.751
We, the people of Britain,
are fed up with being bombed.

27:18.851 --> 27:24.756
We had enough of it last time, with old
Hitler, so will you just leave us in peace?

27:24.856 --> 27:27.677
You live your life
and we'll live ours.

27:27.777 --> 27:29.470
Hope you are well.

27:29.570 --> 27:34.729
Please don't drop any bombs.
Yours sincerely, Mr and Mrs J Bloggs.

27:35.451 --> 27:38.647
Very good, dear. Very nice. Yes.

27:38.747 --> 27:40.774
You might be a bit late for the post.

27:40.874 --> 27:43.108
You know what the
post is like these days.

27:43.208 --> 27:45.449
First class might just get there.

27:46.713 --> 27:48.740
But I must do this list.

27:48.840 --> 27:55.747
"Dustbin, calendar, books, games, paper,
pencils, shovel, spade, crowbar, axe, hatchet,

27:55.847 --> 27:58.542
saw, whistle and/or gong for alarms,

27:58.642 --> 28:01.586
suitcases for furniture
or evacuation,

28:01.686 --> 28:03.927
string, pliers...

28:05.065 --> 28:10.429
first-aid kits, safety pins, scissors,
flints, aspirins, diarrhoea remedy,

28:10.529 --> 28:15.309
tweezers, calamine lotion,
war crisis editions, lice-flea powder,

28:15.409 --> 28:18.353
rodent poison, insulin,
blood-pressure tablets,

28:18.453 --> 28:22.866
rubber gloves, sanitary towels,
mirror, toilet paper, eyewash."

28:24.127 --> 28:26.487
I wonder if it's true
about the paper bags.

28:26.587 --> 28:28.823
Or is it a joke?

28:28.923 --> 28:31.246
I never know if it's
just a joke or not.

28:32.218 --> 28:34.245
What's that, dear?

28:34.345 --> 28:40.001
Well, they say you should get into a
paper bag just before the bomb goes off.

28:40.101 --> 28:42.128
Whatever for?

28:43.689 --> 28:48.176
I suppose it's like the white paint.
It... deflects the heat a bit.

28:48.276 --> 28:52.514
- Sounds silly to me.
- There are some paper bags.

28:52.614 --> 28:56.519
We had spuds from the farm in them.
There should be four.

28:56.619 --> 28:59.391
They'll be filthy, James.

29:00.288 --> 29:03.609
Are you sure your
bag is clean, James?

29:03.709 --> 29:07.408
Yes, dear, I...
cleaned it thoroughly.

29:10.299 --> 29:14.454
You do look silly!

29:14.554 --> 29:18.454
I wonder if it's all
right to have eyeholes.

29:19.391 --> 29:22.211
They say it's the correct
thing to wear white.

29:22.311 --> 29:26.841
People in Hiroshima with patterned clothes
got burned where the pattern was,

29:26.941 --> 29:28.969
and not so much on the white bits.

29:29.069 --> 29:30.679
Even the buttons showed up.

29:30.779 --> 29:33.018
Yes, but they were Japanese.

29:34.449 --> 29:37.185
Is there a clean white shirt,
dear, ready for the bomb?

29:37.285 --> 29:41.106
You're not going to wear that nice
new one I gave you for Christmas!

29:41.206 --> 29:42.983
I don't want that spoiled.

29:43.083 --> 29:46.820
You can wear your old clothes for the
bomb and save the best for afterwards.

29:46.920 --> 29:51.033
All right, dear. Well, is there an
old white one, without stripes?

29:51.133 --> 29:52.826
I don't want stripes all over me.

29:52.926 --> 29:54.953
I've never heard such nonsense.

29:55.053 --> 29:58.248
We didn't think what colour
clothes we had on in the war.

29:58.348 --> 30:01.919
Lucky to have any clothes at all,
with everything on coupons.

30:02.019 --> 30:06.006
We interrupt this programme for an
official government announcement.

30:06.106 --> 30:09.301
An enemy missile attack has been
launched against this country.

30:09.401 --> 30:11.930
It is estimated that the missiles

30:12.030 --> 30:15.266
will arrive in approximately
three minutes. Three minutes.

30:15.366 --> 30:18.061
God almighty, ducks!
There's only three minutes to go!

30:18.161 --> 30:20.063
Oh, dear. I'll just
put the washing on.

30:20.163 --> 30:22.941
Come back, you stupid bitch,
and get in the shelter!

30:23.041 --> 30:26.403
- How dare you talk to me like that, James!
- Shut up and get in!

30:26.503 --> 30:29.698
There's no need to forget our manners
just because there's a war on.

30:29.798 --> 30:31.324
Shut up! I'm trying to listen!

30:31.424 --> 30:33.243
Take shelter immediately.

30:33.343 --> 30:35.551
I've never heard such
language in all my life.

30:35.652 --> 30:39.417
- For God's sake, shut up!
- Oh, dear! I've left the oven on!

30:39.517 --> 30:41.544
Get in! Get in! Get in!

30:41.644 --> 30:43.254
The cake will be burned!

30:43.354 --> 30:46.340
Lie down. Keep away from windows.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.468
Cover your head and eyes.

30:48.568 --> 30:51.513
Do not look at the sky
or through windows.

30:51.613 --> 30:54.223
Take shelter immediately.

30:54.323 --> 30:56.559
Repeat. % stay indoors.

30:56.659 --> 30:59.397
Do not leave your home.

31:23.645 --> 31:25.803
The cake will be be burned!

31:54.969 --> 31:57.210
The cake will be burned!

33:42.080 --> 33:44.319
Blimey!

33:46.334 --> 33:50.912
- Blimey!
- Well I never!

33:51.840 --> 33:55.662
Well, I... I suppose... that was it.

33:55.762 --> 33:58.001
I should think so.

33:58.890 --> 34:01.129
Blimey!

34:02.268 --> 34:04.295
You all right, dear?

34:04.395 --> 34:06.634
Yes, thanks, love.

34:08.023 --> 34:09.931
Oh, dear.

34:10.819 --> 34:12.846
I do feel all shaky.

34:12.946 --> 34:14.973
Never mind, ducks.

34:15.072 --> 34:17.846
We're... We're still
in one piece, eh?

34:18.743 --> 34:20.686
Yes, I think so.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.817
- Wasn't it light?
- Yes.

34:24.917 --> 34:26.944
Terrific.

34:27.043 --> 34:30.739
You get terrific light
with these bombs.

34:30.839 --> 34:33.742
- The heat!
- I know.

34:33.842 --> 34:35.417
Phew!

34:36.469 --> 34:38.710
It's still hot now.

34:39.974 --> 34:43.252
I wonder how far we are
away from the epicentre.

34:43.351 --> 34:46.387
Or was it the hypocentre?

34:47.565 --> 34:49.132
I can't remember.

34:49.233 --> 34:50.926
What's that, dear?

34:51.025 --> 34:56.103
Well, it's the centre of it all. You know,
the... the bull's-eye, sort of.

34:57.033 --> 35:00.228
Bang in the middle. Or...
Or middle of the bang, rather.

35:00.328 --> 35:03.607
I should think we were
bang in the middle, dear.

35:03.707 --> 35:05.946
A direct hit.

35:07.002 --> 35:09.154
Oh, just look at all that glass.

35:09.254 --> 35:12.324
No, no, it couldn't have
been a direct hit, dear.

35:12.424 --> 35:16.746
We would have sustained greater damage
and suffered greater casualties.

35:16.846 --> 35:21.542
Don't talk to me about damage.
Just look at those curtains!

35:21.642 --> 35:25.463
Yes, but it would have been much
worse at the epi-hypo thing, dear.

35:25.563 --> 35:28.924
I don't see how it could
have been much worse.

35:29.024 --> 35:31.263
I'll never get them clean.

35:32.486 --> 35:36.265
I'll give them a good soak tonight.
Blessed Germans!

35:36.365 --> 35:38.605
Russkies, dear.

35:40.036 --> 35:43.607
Mm! The shelter stood
up well, didn't it?

35:43.707 --> 35:47.944
I constructed it in compliance
with governmental specifications.

35:48.044 --> 35:52.615
- I hope the cushions aren't spoiled.
- I think some of them blew off in the blast.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.784
I do like nice cushions.

35:54.884 --> 35:57.788
Yes, but there's more important
things at the moment, ducks.

35:57.888 --> 36:01.338
And curtains. Cushions and curtains.

36:02.226 --> 36:04.795
I'd better get out and
put them in soak now.

36:04.895 --> 36:09.091
- Stay in! Dear.
- Don't you shout at me, James.

36:09.191 --> 36:11.594
But it's the whole point, dearest.

36:11.694 --> 36:14.013
This is what the shelter's for.

36:14.113 --> 36:16.474
But the blessed bomb
has gone off already.

36:16.574 --> 36:20.478
Yes, but the fallout is
falling out now. See?

36:20.578 --> 36:22.521
No, I don't see.

36:23.247 --> 36:25.570
I can't see any soppy fallout.

36:26.333 --> 36:27.861
I'm getting out.

36:27.961 --> 36:30.989
- Just look at all that mess!
- No. No!

36:31.089 --> 36:34.909
We must stay in.
We must do the correct thing.

36:35.009 --> 36:36.369
Come on, now.

36:36.469 --> 36:40.417
It's late. Let's get to bed.

36:47.022 --> 36:50.718
Whatever is this box
of sand for, James?

36:50.818 --> 36:54.053
It had better not be for
what I think it's for.

36:54.153 --> 36:58.058
I've told you what I think
about that subject already.

36:58.158 --> 37:01.692
Bomb or no bomb, Hitler or no Hitler,

37:01.793 --> 37:04.565
I'm going to go to the
toilet in the proper manner!

37:04.665 --> 37:07.067
No, dear, it's not an earth tray.

37:07.167 --> 37:10.571
The governmental directive says
it's for cleaning plates, an'that.

37:10.671 --> 37:12.698
Cleaning plates?

37:12.798 --> 37:17.119
Why shouldn't we wash them properly,
and dry them on a nice clean tea towel?

37:17.219 --> 37:20.790
We washed up properly
all through the war.

37:20.890 --> 37:25.336
Well, it's to conserve emergency
water supplies, dear.

37:25.436 --> 37:28.591
What is the world coming to?

37:28.691 --> 37:32.341
- You see, dear...
- Tuck my feet in.

37:33.361 --> 37:36.098
My old mother would
have a fit if she knew.

37:36.198 --> 37:39.309
- Yes, but...
- Drying plates in an earth tray!

37:39.409 --> 37:42.647
Catch me eating off a
plate covered in sand!

37:42.747 --> 37:44.774
You'd be the first to complain.

37:44.874 --> 37:46.859
Dear...

37:46.959 --> 37:52.198
A bit of grit in your winkles and you're
spitting and splattering all over the place.

37:52.298 --> 37:58.417
Tomorrow, you can put that thing outside
for someone's cat, where it belongs.

38:03.142 --> 38:05.382
Ooh-er!

38:06.270 --> 38:11.215
I'm getting fed up stuck in this thing!
I want to get out and tidy up!

38:12.993 --> 38:16.298
Just look at all that mess out there!

38:16.598 --> 38:18.958
We must do the correct thing, dear.

38:19.058 --> 38:23.171
We must remain in the
inner core or refuge.

38:23.271 --> 38:25.841
Ours not to reason why.

38:25.941 --> 38:29.845
Our but to... something or other.

38:29.945 --> 38:33.932
It tells you about this problem in the
County Council directive. I'll show you.

38:34.032 --> 38:36.401
Let's see. Where is it?

38:36.501 --> 38:37.828
Ah, yes. Here we are.

38:37.928 --> 38:44.794
"During this period, reduced external stimuli
may produce problems of group behaviour."

38:44.894 --> 38:46.796
Oh, yes, I see, dear.

38:46.896 --> 38:50.675
"Steps to combat this may
include the following:

38:50.775 --> 38:54.219
At intervals,
stimulate group activities."

38:54.319 --> 38:57.891
Don't you dare start stimulating, James!
I'm not in the mood.

38:57.991 --> 38:59.476
No, dear!

38:59.576 --> 39:01.853
It means discussions, an' that.

39:01.953 --> 39:06.696
It says, "Discussions, card games,
story-telling, quizzes, etcetera."

39:08.043 --> 39:10.361
Perhaps we'd better
try story-telling.

39:10.461 --> 39:12.489
You tell me one.

39:12.589 --> 39:15.700
No, I can't. I'd feel funny.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.827
You're not a baby.

39:17.927 --> 39:21.579
- Well, pretend I am.
- Don't be silly.

39:22.558 --> 39:24.585
- Go on.
- No.

39:24.685 --> 39:26.712
You tell me one.

39:26.812 --> 39:29.337
- I don't know any.
- There you are, then.

39:30.983 --> 39:33.010
What about a quiz?

39:33.110 --> 39:37.932
- I spy with my little eye...
- Oh, not that. It's childish, James.

39:38.032 --> 39:43.688
Or it says here, "Discuss the
changed conditions after an attack,

39:43.788 --> 39:48.192
and consider how to
overcome or adapt to them."

39:48.292 --> 39:51.488
Well... et's start on that one, dear.

39:51.588 --> 39:53.949
Who's going to start
the ball rolling, eh?

39:54.049 --> 39:55.742
Shall I kick off, eh? Eh?

39:55.842 --> 39:57.869
Right. Here goes.

39:59.304 --> 40:04.418
I think... we could overcome the
changed conditions after an attack

40:04.518 --> 40:07.171
by... all pulling our weight,

40:07.271 --> 40:09.298
putting our shoulders to the wheel,

40:09.398 --> 40:14.052
so that we all pull together,
now that our backs are against the wall.

40:14.152 --> 40:16.556
And we can show these Jerries...

40:16.656 --> 40:19.767
I mean Russkies,
just what we think of them.

40:19.867 --> 40:23.729
And... Well, that's all, I think.

40:23.829 --> 40:27.980
Hooray, James!
You ought to be a politician.

40:30.795 --> 40:35.573
It says, "Reading aloud to
pass the time is a good idea."

40:37.678 --> 40:40.456
It's a good job I got this
book from the public library.

40:40.556 --> 40:43.374
It's called "Armageddon And You."

40:43.474 --> 40:47.045
There's a terrific bit in it
about Western defences.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.172
Now, just listen to this.

40:49.272 --> 40:52.551
"There are three B.M.E. Ws...

40:52.651 --> 40:55.721
Ballistic Missile Early
Warning systems.

40:55.821 --> 41:02.644
One P.R.C. S... Perimeter Acquisition
Radar Attack Characterisation System.

41:02.744 --> 41:07.567
Then there's N.O.R.A. D...
North American Air Defense.

41:07.667 --> 41:11.154
And J.S. S...
Joint Surveillance System.

41:11.254 --> 41:16.325
And then seven R.O.C. Cs...
Regional Operation Control Centres.

41:16.425 --> 41:21.623
Then there's N.A.D.G. E...
Nato Air Defence Ground Environment,

41:21.723 --> 41:27.629
and several A. W.C. S...
Airborne Warning and Control Systems.

41:27.729 --> 41:33.176
All this is controlled by the N.C. A...
National Command Authority,

41:33.276 --> 41:38.766
by means of the N.M.C. S...
National Military Command System.

41:38.866 --> 41:43.353
And A.M.C. C...
Alternative Military Command Centre.

41:43.453 --> 41:48.275
And N.E.A.C. C... National Emergency
Airborne Command Centre.

41:48.375 --> 41:56.239
And it all comes under W. W.M.C.C. S...
Worldwide Military Command & Control System.

42:00.387 --> 42:04.793
We should be all right with that
lot looking after us, eh, ducks?

42:04.893 --> 42:07.462
Well, it didn't stop them
from bombing us, did it?

42:07.562 --> 42:11.257
Oh... well, no...
I suppose not, really.

42:11.357 --> 42:14.595
Still, just think,
it might have been worse.

42:14.695 --> 42:16.971
Got to look on the
bright side, ducks.

42:17.906 --> 42:22.811
Besides, another thing the powers
that be have created is called M.A.D.

42:22.911 --> 42:25.105
- Mad?
- Yes, M.A.D.

42:25.205 --> 42:28.484
M.A.D. Mutal Assured Destruction.

42:28.584 --> 42:30.694
I read about it in
the public library.

42:30.794 --> 42:34.156
I think my old dad was in the
Mutual Assured Insurance.

42:34.256 --> 42:38.327
- A penny a week it was, in those days.
- This isn't insurance, ducks.

42:38.427 --> 42:41.163
I think it covered the
cost of the funeral.

42:41.263 --> 42:43.708
Yes, well, I suppose this is similar.

42:43.808 --> 42:45.835
It all comes out of our taxes.

42:45.935 --> 42:48.590
He had a lovely funeral, our dad.

42:49.939 --> 42:52.925
You don't pay any taxes now.
You're retired, James.

42:53.025 --> 42:55.052
No, I'm fully paid up.

42:55.152 --> 42:57.392
My funeral is fully assured.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.850
Time we went to bed.

43:00.950 --> 43:02.977
It's getting dark.

43:03.077 --> 43:06.773
I'll sleep in my clothes.
It's an all-out war situation.

43:06.873 --> 43:09.818
I might be called out in the
night for an emergency.

43:09.918 --> 43:12.863
They may need all able-bodied
men at short notice.

43:12.963 --> 43:17.707
They'll soon change their minds when
they see your pot-bellied little body.

43:22.765 --> 43:25.004
Morning, dear.

43:25.935 --> 43:29.964
- How do you feel?
- Oh, dear.

43:30.064 --> 43:33.300
- I ache all over.
- So do I.

43:34.276 --> 43:36.515
I've got a terrific headache.

43:37.404 --> 43:40.767
Oh... I still feel so tired.

43:40.867 --> 43:44.353
Never mind, ducks. It's probably shock.
The bomb, an' that.

43:44.453 --> 43:46.482
Oh, it's bound to upset us a bit.

43:46.582 --> 43:50.485
After all, you don't get a nuclear
bomb every day of the week, do you?

43:50.585 --> 43:53.738
Just as well. Never knew a
bomb could give you headaches.

43:53.838 --> 43:58.660
Oh, yes, ducks. I told you these bombs
have a terrific effect on all sorts of things.

43:58.760 --> 44:03.089
Right. A nice cup of
tea will perk you up.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.767
Funny. They've cut the water off.

44:21.867 --> 44:24.895
Still, that's logical.
It might be contaminated.

44:24.995 --> 44:28.065
It's a wise precaution for the
protection of the population.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.192
Use the bottles, dear.

44:30.292 --> 44:34.443
Oh, yes, of course.
The emergency reserve supplies.

44:37.759 --> 44:40.579
Most of them seem to have
been broken in the blast, dear.

44:40.679 --> 44:42.919
The contents have been dissipated.

44:46.434 --> 44:48.837
Funny. The electric's off, too.

44:48.937 --> 44:50.881
Still, bound to be.

44:50.981 --> 44:53.008
Conservation of energy resources.

44:53.108 --> 44:56.762
A wise governmental precaution during
the period of national emergency.

44:56.862 --> 44:59.598
Good job we've got that
little picnic stove, eh, dear?

44:59.698 --> 45:01.600
Are there any aspirins?

45:01.700 --> 45:05.604
Mind it doesn't pop,
James. I can't...

45:05.704 --> 45:07.945
bear it when it pops.

45:09.458 --> 45:11.486
Mm!

45:11.586 --> 45:15.031
Nothing like a cup of tea, hm?

45:15.131 --> 45:17.700
Crumbs! I must be dreaming.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.955
The news! We're just in time.

45:22.179 --> 45:25.291
No. Nothing. There's nothing.

45:25.391 --> 45:26.710
All dead.

45:26.810 --> 45:29.713
- What about the telly?
- Yes, of course.

45:29.813 --> 45:32.171
They may have filmed it all.

45:38.237 --> 45:40.477
We may see our bomb on the news.

45:42.075 --> 45:45.896
No. All dead.

45:45.996 --> 45:48.315
- No picture?
- No.

45:48.415 --> 45:51.318
- Not even just the voices?
- No! Nothing.

45:51.418 --> 45:54.406
- All dead.
- All dead?

45:56.090 --> 45:59.453
- We'll have to wait for the paper.
- There should be some good pictures.

45:59.553 --> 46:01.580
These bombs are quite spectacular.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.541
- He's late already.
- Yes, well, that's logical.

46:04.641 --> 46:09.667
There's bound to be delays and shortages
during the period of national emergency.

46:10.772 --> 46:15.884
I'll miss the serial on Woman's Hour.
It was just getting interesting.

46:18.655 --> 46:21.856
Crumbs! I haven't
tried the transistor.

46:23.452 --> 46:26.481
No. Seems to have packed up.

46:26.581 --> 46:28.356
Or probably needs new batteries.

46:28.456 --> 46:30.735
Yes, I must pop down to Willis's.

46:30.835 --> 46:33.696
They are a price these days.

46:33.796 --> 46:36.949
97p last time. Just fancy!

46:37.049 --> 46:41.995
We ought to get one of these new hi-fis
when your endowment policy comes up.

46:42.095 --> 46:45.914
Oh, yes. Or a stereo.
I've only got two years to go.

46:47.101 --> 46:51.797
- I hope Ron and Beryl got back all right.
- Oh, yes, they'll be all right.

46:51.897 --> 46:56.385
- Our Ron's a very careful driver.
- I didn't mean the driving so much, dear.

46:56.485 --> 46:57.888
More the bomb.

46:57.988 --> 46:59.896
I'll give them a ring.

47:00.657 --> 47:03.264
Hello? Hello? Hello?

47:04.077 --> 47:05.687
No, it's not even ringing.

47:05.787 --> 47:07.814
Oh, I expect the lines are down.

47:07.914 --> 47:11.735
They say there are red-hot
winds of 500 miles an hour.

47:11.835 --> 47:14.705
I expect that would render
the lines inoperable.

47:15.756 --> 47:18.529
I'll drop him them a line...
tell them to give us a ring.

47:19.426 --> 47:23.121
- Do you think the post will be going?
- Oh, yes, bound to be.

47:23.221 --> 47:26.417
The powers that be will endeavour
to maintain communications.

47:26.517 --> 47:29.754
Remember the Blitz?
The post went on just the same.

47:29.854 --> 47:33.674
It's government policy. It keeps
up the morale of the population.

47:33.774 --> 47:35.801
I hope Ron is insured.

47:35.901 --> 47:38.262
You did pay ours, didn't you, James?

47:38.362 --> 47:42.433
Oh, yes, dear. The bomb won't cost
us a penny. We'll be well covered.

47:42.533 --> 47:44.773
Mm. Lovely.

47:45.870 --> 47:49.355
We can have some nice new
curtains for the summer.

47:56.422 --> 47:59.993
Crumbs! I wonder if
it's all over already.

48:00.093 --> 48:04.457
If it is all over,
I wish I knew who'd won.

48:04.557 --> 48:08.919
We can't have lost the war, can we,
James? We won the other two.

48:09.019 --> 48:11.046
No, of course not.

48:11.146 --> 48:13.173
Remember old Churchill?

48:13.273 --> 48:15.468
"We will never surrender."

48:15.568 --> 48:18.513
Yes, but Churchill's not
prime minister now, dear.

48:18.613 --> 48:22.141
No. Well... of course not.

48:22.241 --> 48:27.605
I suppose it won't be the same without...
with old whatshisname, will it?

48:27.705 --> 48:29.945
Who is it, anyway?

48:31.250 --> 48:35.447
I must check the emergency supplies list.
We never had time to finish it.

48:35.547 --> 48:39.951
It says here,
"...a notebook for messages."

48:40.051 --> 48:42.580
Who are you going to
write messages to, dear?

48:42.680 --> 48:47.835
Well, you never know. There's always
a need for vital messages in wartime.

48:47.935 --> 48:52.047
Our lives might depend on a vital message
getting through to headquarters.

48:52.147 --> 48:53.508
Oh, I see, dear.

48:53.608 --> 48:57.566
And it says, "...a whistle
and gong for alarm."

48:57.667 --> 48:59.472
Oh, what will you
do with that, dear?

48:59.572 --> 49:05.227
Well, if I saw a Russky coming down the
lane, I'd bang the gong. If we had one.

49:05.327 --> 49:08.856
- Wouldn't he shoot you, dear?
- What, just for banging a gong?

49:08.956 --> 49:11.860
He'd be well within his rights to
shoot you if there's a war on.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.987
Oh, crumbs! You really think so?

49:14.087 --> 49:16.114
Just for banging a gong?

49:16.214 --> 49:19.534
- I'm glad we haven't got a gong.
- We've got a whistle.

49:19.634 --> 49:23.246
- Have we? Where is it?
- I'm not sure.

49:23.346 --> 49:25.874
Hm. Never mind.

49:25.974 --> 49:29.175
Let's leave it. Let's leave it.

50:11.396 --> 50:14.799
Oh, I do feel tired.

50:14.899 --> 50:18.512
Really exhausted and... all dizzy.

50:18.612 --> 50:22.599
Nervous exhaustion due to
unaccustomed lifestyle.

50:22.699 --> 50:24.184
That's what that is.

50:24.284 --> 50:26.853
How's your headache, dear?

50:26.953 --> 50:31.400
Just the same, thanks.
Aspirins didn't seem to do any good at all.

50:32.208 --> 50:36.530
I think I've got a temperature.
I feel all hot and shivery.

50:36.630 --> 50:39.033
You do look pale, dear.

50:39.133 --> 50:42.995
- I should have an early night.
- I must clear up.

50:43.095 --> 50:48.208
Suppose someone comes and sees the place
in this state? We might have visitors.

50:48.308 --> 50:52.038
Yes. The Emergency Service
should arrive today.

50:52.138 --> 50:54.468
I'm surprised they've
not come before.

50:54.569 --> 50:57.553
I expect they've got a lot
of people to attend to.

50:57.653 --> 51:00.764
Oh, yes. We're only
an outlying district.

51:00.864 --> 51:04.226
They'll be heavily engaged
within the stricken area itself.

51:04.326 --> 51:09.272
- Will it be like meals on wheels, dear?
- Yes, I should think so.

51:09.372 --> 51:12.568
There'll be mobile canteens
and soup kitchens,

51:12.668 --> 51:14.695
teams of doctors and nurses,

51:14.795 --> 51:18.490
helicopters flying in blankets
and medical supplies.

51:18.590 --> 51:21.785
It'll all move slowly
into action, you bet.

51:21.885 --> 51:24.622
They'll all be here
in next to no time.

51:24.722 --> 51:30.210
The governmental authorities have been
aware of this eventuality for years.

51:30.310 --> 51:34.507
So continency plans will have
been formulated long ago.

51:34.607 --> 51:37.301
We won't have to worry about a thing.

51:37.401 --> 51:40.597
The powers that be will
get to us in the end.

51:40.697 --> 51:43.099
I hope they come soon, dear.

51:43.199 --> 51:45.439
I'm not feeling very well.

51:46.786 --> 51:49.440
I wonder if we'd have been
better off in the cellar.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.232
Oh, no, dear. Too damp.

51:51.332 --> 51:53.359
Think of my rheumatism.

51:53.459 --> 51:56.613
- Would you like a bite to eat, dearest?
- No, thanks.

51:56.713 --> 51:58.740
I'm right off food.

51:58.840 --> 52:01.080
So am I.

52:01.968 --> 52:06.037
I must go to the toilet.
And I don't want any arguments.

52:07.056 --> 52:09.043
Blessed dust everywhere.

52:09.143 --> 52:11.629
Oh, crumbs! I forgot!

52:11.729 --> 52:14.632
We're supposed to stay in
the inner core or refuge!

52:14.732 --> 52:17.968
Well, it's too late now.
We've been out for ages.

52:18.068 --> 52:20.513
Oh, blimey! It was the whole point!

52:20.613 --> 52:23.307
I wonder if there's
any radiation about.

52:23.407 --> 52:26.181
Well, I can't see anything.

52:28.287 --> 52:31.483
Hurry up, dear, and get back
in the inner core or refuge!

52:31.583 --> 52:33.823
We'd better have an early night.

52:34.753 --> 52:38.907
Well, if you can't see
it and can't feel it,

52:39.007 --> 52:42.373
it can't be doing you
any harm, can it?

52:47.577 --> 52:51.105
Better try and...
eat something today, dear.

52:51.205 --> 52:54.109
I was sick three times in the night.

52:54.209 --> 52:56.236
My headache's even worse.

52:56.336 --> 52:58.654
Let's have a walk round
the garden, dear.

52:58.754 --> 53:04.494
I've just read it's only 48 hours in
the inner core or refuge, not 14 days.

53:04.594 --> 53:09.421
A bit of fresh air is all we need.
I'll get a nice lettuce.

53:21.069 --> 53:23.097
Crumbs! Look at the door!

53:23.197 --> 53:26.476
The paint's all gone.
Scorched down to the wood.

53:26.576 --> 53:30.524
Never mind, dear.
You said you'd burn it off one day.

53:32.248 --> 53:35.026
The leaves have all gone
off the apple tree, ducks.

53:35.126 --> 53:38.529
Oh, yes! What a shame!

53:38.629 --> 53:41.408
Still, it'll be lovely in the spring.

53:41.508 --> 53:43.747
It is spring, dear.

53:46.596 --> 53:48.373
Oh! Listen!

53:48.473 --> 53:50.712
A dog!

53:51.601 --> 53:54.423
Oh, poor thing!

53:55.188 --> 53:57.215
I expect he's hungry.

53:57.315 --> 54:00.011
The heat has affected
the hedge, love.

54:00.111 --> 54:04.514
- The beans look a bit shrivelled.
- And I think the lettuce have evaporated.

54:04.614 --> 54:07.056
Well, they do have a
high water content.

54:07.951 --> 54:13.065
- Can you see any fallout falling out, James?
- No, the sun is trying to get through.

54:13.165 --> 54:16.194
They didn't blow up the sun,
thank goodness.

54:16.294 --> 54:20.239
Oh, no, dear.
Science is still in its infancy.

54:20.339 --> 54:22.908
What does the fallout
look like, dear?

54:23.008 --> 54:25.828
I don't know. The...
government directive

54:25.928 --> 54:28.914
neglects to mention how the
populous could recognise it.

54:29.014 --> 54:32.294
I expect it's a bit like snow, ducks.
Only greyer.

54:32.394 --> 54:34.753
The grass looks a funny colour.

54:34.853 --> 54:39.050
Yes, I'll pop down to Mr Sponge's tomorrow
and get some bone meal and dried blood.

54:39.150 --> 54:41.928
He might be closed due
to the bomb, dear.

54:42.028 --> 54:48.268
What, old Sponge? Miss a day's trade?
Not him! He'd rather die!

54:48.368 --> 54:52.272
It's very cloudy. Almost foggy.

54:52.372 --> 54:54.608
We need some sun to
bring the garden on.

54:54.708 --> 54:59.738
- The milkman's not been yet. He's late.
- Oh, well, that's logical.

54:59.838 --> 55:02.158
He's bound to be a bit
late after the bomb.

55:02.258 --> 55:05.119
Perhaps he's been called
up to fight, or something.

55:05.219 --> 55:08.497
Oh, yes. Well... maybe.

55:08.597 --> 55:11.122
But they'd have got a
woman or something.

55:13.478 --> 55:15.717
- Quiet, isn't it?
- Yes.

55:16.606 --> 55:20.593
I haven't seen no trains. No traffic.

55:20.693 --> 55:24.477
I expect they're all having
a good lie-in after the bomb.

55:25.407 --> 55:27.434
Terrible smell of burning.

55:27.534 --> 55:32.397
Oh, yes. Well... bound to be.
That's logical.

55:32.497 --> 55:37.652
It's like... roast meat.

55:37.752 --> 55:39.779
Yes! Roast dinners.

55:39.879 --> 55:42.991
I expect people are having their
Sunday dinners early this week,

55:43.091 --> 55:45.993
due to the unexpected circumstances.

55:46.093 --> 55:50.873
The road's gone all funny.
Seems to have melted a bit.

55:51.351 --> 55:55.171
I expect that's why the milkman's late.
He's got stuck somewhere.

55:55.271 --> 55:58.341
I wonder if there's a proper war on.

55:58.441 --> 56:00.468
I wonder who's winning.

56:00.568 --> 56:04.139
Never mind. It'll all
be in the papers, dear.

56:04.239 --> 56:06.475
Come to think of it, he's late, too.

56:06.575 --> 56:08.809
He missed us altogether yesterday.

56:08.909 --> 56:12.147
Well, you can't expect things
to be normal after the bomb.

56:12.247 --> 56:16.526
Difficulties will be experienced throughout
the duration of the emergency period.

56:16.626 --> 56:22.331
Normality will only be assumed after
the sensation of hostilities.

56:23.425 --> 56:27.325
Oh, dear. I think I'm
going to be sick again.

56:30.765 --> 56:33.336
There, there, there, ducks.

56:33.436 --> 56:37.503
All better now?

56:41.068 --> 56:43.679
I had the most terrible
diarrhoea this morning.

56:43.779 --> 56:45.806
Nerves, dear. It's just nerves.

56:45.906 --> 56:49.060
I'm the same, and I'm a man.

56:54.248 --> 56:56.488
Let's sit in the garden for a bit.

56:57.835 --> 57:00.738
Don't you think we ought
to clear up, dear?

57:00.838 --> 57:03.077
Yes, yes, later on.

57:04.467 --> 57:07.412
I feel a bit... weak and dizzy.

57:07.512 --> 57:09.539
We'll make a start soon.

57:09.639 --> 57:12.500
Well, suppose Jerry
comes this afternoon.

57:12.600 --> 57:17.423
No, they'd wait for the fallout to clear.
Too dangerous for a few days.

57:17.523 --> 57:19.550
We've got plenty of time.

57:19.650 --> 57:22.427
The situation is well
in hand, you bet.

57:22.527 --> 57:25.389
Our boys will be lying
in wait for 'em.

57:25.489 --> 57:27.516
I expect they've laid a trap.

57:27.616 --> 57:29.644
Jerry will walk straight into it.

57:29.744 --> 57:33.189
Hello! There's cloud coming up.

57:33.289 --> 57:35.528
Looks like rain.

57:39.379 --> 57:41.947
It's raining! I'm going in.

57:42.047 --> 57:44.326
Rain! Yes!

57:44.426 --> 57:47.081
We can save it!

57:53.726 --> 57:58.672
Don't you get wet, James. You'll catch
a chill. We don't want you laid up again.

58:01.818 --> 58:04.596
We'll be all right for water
now for a while, dear.

58:04.696 --> 58:07.475
Do you think rainwater
is all right to drink?

58:07.575 --> 58:09.893
Oh, yes, of course it is.

58:09.993 --> 58:13.564
There's nothing purer than rainwater,
is there? Everybody knows that.

58:13.664 --> 58:17.193
Perhaps I'd better boil it.
Best to be on the safe side.

58:17.293 --> 58:21.448
Oh, yes, I suppose so. We don't
want to take unnecessary risks.

58:21.548 --> 58:24.284
It may prejudice our
chance of survival.

58:24.384 --> 58:27.870
What do you mean, James?
We have survived, haven't we?

58:27.970 --> 58:34.378
Yes, I know. But after the bombs
on Japan, people died ages later.

58:34.478 --> 58:37.297
I... forget exactly why.

58:37.397 --> 58:39.591
Perhaps they didn't take precautions.

58:39.691 --> 58:43.762
Yes. I expect they neglected
to do the correct thing and...

58:43.862 --> 58:45.889
Oh, and anyway, that was years ago.

58:45.989 --> 58:48.017
Science was in its infancy.

58:48.117 --> 58:50.408
We're better equipped
to deal with the situation

58:50.509 --> 58:52.895
in the light of modern
scientific knowledge.

58:52.995 --> 58:58.735
Oh, yes. Nowadays, there's bound to be
all sorts of anditotes and protectives.

58:58.835 --> 59:03.574
When the medics get through, they'll probably
just spray us with some anditote,

59:03.674 --> 59:08.453
give us a couple of pills, and in
no time, we'll be as right as rain.

59:12.558 --> 59:16.379
I'm glad we moved to the country
when you retired, dear.

59:16.479 --> 59:19.086
Yes. Much more peaceful.

59:19.899 --> 59:23.386
If we'd still been in London,
we'd probably have been bombed out by now.

59:23.486 --> 59:26.764
Yes. Unless we'd been evacuated.

59:26.864 --> 59:30.352
Oh, that was only children.
And women too, of course.

59:30.452 --> 59:33.938
I'd have been requisitioned
for essential war work.

59:34.038 --> 59:36.066
But you're far too old.

59:36.166 --> 59:38.194
You're retired.

59:38.294 --> 59:42.655
Yes, but all age groups are
pressed into emergency service

59:42.755 --> 59:45.201
during times of national
emergency, dear.

59:45.301 --> 59:48.786
I'd have been an air-raid warden.

59:51.141 --> 59:54.674
Or a stretcher bearer
for the Red Cross...

59:55.769 --> 01:00:01.095
and St John's Ambulance Brigade,
or a fireman in the docks.

01:00:04.362 --> 01:00:07.932
Jerry up above,
fire bombs raining down.

01:00:08.032 --> 01:00:10.271
Up the turntable ladder.

01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:14.985
Carrying women to safety.

01:00:16.207 --> 01:00:19.194
Trust you to think of that, James.

01:00:21.587 --> 01:00:23.496
I wish we had neighbours.

01:00:24.341 --> 01:00:26.909
I'd like to ask someone
what's going on.

01:00:27.009 --> 01:00:29.621
Well, I warned you, dear.

01:00:29.721 --> 01:00:32.916
"This cottage is a
bit isolated," I said.

01:00:33.016 --> 01:00:35.340
"You're not going
to like it," I said.

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:39.969
I wish we didn't have to stay put.

01:00:41.442 --> 01:00:43.469
I quite fancy a pint.

01:00:43.569 --> 01:00:47.849
I said I'd see old George down the
Half Moon today for a game of darts.

01:00:52.328 --> 01:00:55.648
I expect he'll be busy with
his cows after the bomb.

01:00:55.748 --> 01:01:00.154
It might have put them off laying...
milking, I mean.

01:01:00.254 --> 01:01:03.781
Yes, it may have curdled
the milk, or something.

01:01:03.881 --> 01:01:06.992
These bombs have a
terrific effect on things.

01:01:07.092 --> 01:01:09.955
He may have switched over to yoghurt.

01:01:10.055 --> 01:01:16.293
Yes. Lots of people's lives are going to
be considerably affected by the bomb.

01:01:17.188 --> 01:01:20.674
London Airport will have
been knocked out, I expect.

01:01:20.774 --> 01:01:24.428
Yes. Bang goes a lot of
people's holidays this year.

01:01:24.528 --> 01:01:27.265
The Yanks won't come dropping in.

01:01:27.365 --> 01:01:30.226
Oh, no. Not unless to help
us against the Russkies.

01:01:30.326 --> 01:01:34.021
Remember in the war?
"Got any gum, chum?"

01:01:34.121 --> 01:01:36.315
We used to stand on
the railway embankment,

01:01:36.415 --> 01:01:40.319
and the Yanks used to shower us with
gum and chocolate and K Rations.

01:01:40.419 --> 01:01:42.447
Terrific, it was.

01:01:42.547 --> 01:01:44.574
I wonder if the Russkies chew gum.

01:01:44.674 --> 01:01:46.701
"Got any gumski, comrade?"

01:01:46.801 --> 01:01:51.040
You won't be able to say that, James.
They're the enemy.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.375
Oh, yes. I keep forgetting.

01:01:54.475 --> 01:01:56.045
Crumbs!

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:58.880
We won't have to try
and kill them, will we?

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:01.508
Oh, I... I suppose so.

01:02:01.608 --> 01:02:04.886
That's what you're supposed
to do to the enemy, isn't it?

01:02:04.986 --> 01:02:08.224
Crumbs! I hadn't really
thought of that.

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:12.311
You mean to say if one of them comes
through that door this afternoon,

01:02:12.411 --> 01:02:14.438
I'm supposed to try and kill him?

01:02:14.538 --> 01:02:18.400
Well, not you, James.
After all, you're retired.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.528
Well, what would I kill him with?

01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:23.578
A bit of old iron, I suppose.

01:02:24.465 --> 01:02:26.992
I must mend those
socks for you, James.

01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:30.079
They'd have Tommy guns.
They always do.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:32.206
He'd mow us down, Hilda!

01:02:32.306 --> 01:02:36.420
If a German sees you in these socks,
he'll think you're just a peasant.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.797
"Die, you Englishe
pig dogs!" he'd say.

01:02:39.897 --> 01:02:44.912
"Enemies of der Fatherland!
Heil Hitler!"

01:02:45.612 --> 01:02:48.971
Oh. Oh, no, sorry. No, no,
that's the last time.

01:02:49.072 --> 01:02:51.951
I keep forgetting,
it's the Russkies now.

01:02:54.496 --> 01:02:57.232
Just suppose that one did come.

01:02:57.332 --> 01:02:59.359
A great big Russian.

01:02:59.459 --> 01:03:02.904
Big overcoat, great big
boots with snow on them.

01:03:03.004 --> 01:03:07.118
Great furry hat, all covered
in belts of ammo and grenades.

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.954
Bloomin' great Tommy gun
pointing straight at us!

01:03:10.054 --> 01:03:12.082
What am I supposed to do?

01:03:12.182 --> 01:03:16.086
You could offer him a
cup of tea, I suppose.

01:03:16.186 --> 01:03:17.795
Argh!

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:19.964
We mustn't be collaborators, Hilda.

01:03:20.064 --> 01:03:22.092
They'd shave our heads.

01:03:22.192 --> 01:03:26.262
Russians like tea. A cup of
tea wouldn't hurt, surely?

01:03:26.362 --> 01:03:30.180
I suppose it's better than being
mown down in a hail of bullets.

01:03:31.075 --> 01:03:35.480
Crumbs! They might round us up and
take us off to the concentration camps.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.483
Why? We've not done anything.

01:03:38.583 --> 01:03:40.986
We're not Jews, or anything.

01:03:41.086 --> 01:03:44.537
- Your grandfather was a Jew.
- He was not!

01:03:45.424 --> 01:03:47.992
Well, only partly.

01:03:48.092 --> 01:03:51.080
They'd send us to Liberia.
Down the salt mines.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.333
- Whatever for?
- I don't know.

01:03:54.433 --> 01:03:56.044
They always do.

01:03:56.144 --> 01:03:58.171
Perhaps Russians eat a lot of salt.

01:03:58.271 --> 01:04:01.555
I expect they're quite nice, really.

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:05.428
I saw the Russians
dancing on telly once.

01:04:05.528 --> 01:04:07.139
All in boots.

01:04:07.239 --> 01:04:09.266
They seemed nice.

01:04:09.366 --> 01:04:12.520
Oh, yes. I bet some of them are nice.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.904
There were supposed to be
some nice Germans last time.

01:04:21.544 --> 01:04:26.537
I think we're running out of water again,
dear. The rainwater's all gone.

01:04:28.719 --> 01:04:31.371
Oh, we've still got a pint of milk.

01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:34.042
Better save that for teatime.

01:04:34.142 --> 01:04:36.710
I can't bear tea without milk.

01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:41.007
- Posh people have lemon in it.
- I know! Horrible!

01:04:41.107 --> 01:04:42.675
Crumbs!

01:04:42.775 --> 01:04:46.345
I wonder if it was an American
missile falling a bit short.

01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:51.268
That happened in the war...
blokes getting shelled by their own guns.

01:04:51.368 --> 01:04:55.772
Be funny if it was an American
missile that had landed on us.

01:04:55.872 --> 01:04:57.899
Wouldn't it, dear?

01:04:57.999 --> 01:05:00.401
I can't see it's very funny, James.

01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:03.905
No, well...
Funny peculiar, I mean.

01:05:04.005 --> 01:05:06.283
Are they worse than the Russian ones?

01:05:06.383 --> 01:05:12.038
Oh, I shouldn't think so, love.
I expect they're all much of a muchness.

01:05:12.138 --> 01:05:13.957
They all work on the same principle.

01:05:14.057 --> 01:05:17.169
It's called... megadeath, I think.

01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:20.464
So many millions of
people dead per bang.

01:05:20.564 --> 01:05:22.800
Any ketchup, dear?

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.886
I expect the quantity
is similar either way.

01:05:25.986 --> 01:05:28.680
Are all the bangs about
the same size, then?

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.767
Oh, no! There's one megaton,

01:05:31.867 --> 01:05:34.273
and 10 megaton, an' that.

01:05:35.288 --> 01:05:39.567
It's... just a question of
how big a bang you want to make

01:05:39.667 --> 01:05:44.072
and how many...
people you want to kill.

01:05:44.172 --> 01:05:46.329
More baked beans, dear?

01:05:47.217 --> 01:05:50.203
No, thanks. I'm a bit off food.

01:05:50.303 --> 01:05:54.207
Then there's the... overkill, see?

01:05:54.307 --> 01:05:58.755
That's where they kill more
people than they really need to.

01:05:59.646 --> 01:06:03.675
Say you want a bang big enough
to kill one million people,

01:06:03.775 --> 01:06:07.804
and you go and use a
three-million-people bang.

01:06:07.904 --> 01:06:11.933
It's terrifically wasteful of energy,
in the present economic climate.

01:06:12.033 --> 01:06:13.810
I see, dear.

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:18.190
Yes, there's one thing about
the present economic situation.

01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:20.317
- I mean...
- Such a shame we can't wash up.

01:06:20.417 --> 01:06:25.156
...in order to conserve
world energy resources,

01:06:25.256 --> 01:06:29.369
the powers that be will only use
the smallest possible bang.

01:06:29.469 --> 01:06:32.080
Oh, I can't bear it!

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.666
I expect that's why we're still here.

01:06:34.766 --> 01:06:36.918
We're running out of crockery.

01:06:37.018 --> 01:06:41.512
We could say we owe our lives to
the world economic procession.

01:06:45.944 --> 01:06:48.763
Put the kettle on, will you, ducks?

01:06:48.863 --> 01:06:51.103
There's no water, dear.

01:06:52.159 --> 01:06:54.399
Oh, no, no. Of course.

01:06:55.496 --> 01:06:58.232
Just... Just have to have milk, then.

01:06:58.332 --> 01:07:00.818
That pint's gone bad, dear.

01:07:00.918 --> 01:07:03.196
The fridge has been off.

01:07:03.296 --> 01:07:06.068
Oh, heck! Well...

01:07:07.007 --> 01:07:08.867
...a black coffee, then.

01:07:08.967 --> 01:07:11.077
There's still no water, dear.

01:07:12.763 --> 01:07:17.002
Well, what... What are we
going to drink, eh? Eh?

01:07:17.102 --> 01:07:20.880
What... What... What are we
going to drink, for God's sake?

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.219
Don't shout, dearest.

01:07:24.609 --> 01:07:26.636
I'm sorry, love.

01:07:26.736 --> 01:07:29.806
I'm just... terribly thirsty.

01:07:29.906 --> 01:07:32.642
How about a nice sweet, dear?

01:07:32.742 --> 01:07:35.065
It's a blackcurrant fruit pastille.

01:07:36.663 --> 01:07:39.781
There's only one left.

01:07:40.667 --> 01:07:43.619
- You have it.
- No, you have it.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.907
We'll... We'll cut it in half.

01:07:47.007 --> 01:07:49.246
That's... That's fair.

01:07:56.725 --> 01:08:00.587
- Help!
- I'm coming! I-I-I'm coming! I'm coming!

01:08:00.687 --> 01:08:02.881
A rat! A rat!

01:08:02.981 --> 01:08:06.100
A rat in the lavatory!

01:08:08.321 --> 01:08:12.808
Eeww! I saw it!
Its tail waving in the pan!

01:08:12.908 --> 01:08:14.935
Never mind, dear. Never mind.

01:08:15.035 --> 01:08:18.607
No, no, no. It won't
hurt you, dearest.

01:08:18.707 --> 01:08:24.446
The pan's all dry and its...
head was round the bend...

01:08:24.546 --> 01:08:27.615
just its bottom end
sticking out. A tail!

01:08:27.715 --> 01:08:29.742
Oh! A tail!

01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:33.162
Horrible! Horrible!

01:08:33.263 --> 01:08:34.456
There, there, dear.

01:08:34.555 --> 01:08:40.462
Don't worry, I... I'll pop down to Willis's
in the morning and I'll get some warfarin.

01:08:40.563 --> 01:08:44.178
At least it shows that the
drains aren't blocked.

01:08:45.234 --> 01:08:47.059
Oh, dear!

01:08:48.196 --> 01:08:50.223
I do feel queer!

01:08:50.323 --> 01:08:51.849
All shaky.

01:08:51.948 --> 01:08:55.769
Well, it's bound to upset you a bit.

01:08:55.868 --> 01:08:58.109
The... The bomb, I mean.

01:09:01.917 --> 01:09:04.988
Have you got... lipstick on, dear?

01:09:05.087 --> 01:09:07.116
Lipstick?

01:09:07.216 --> 01:09:09.243
What do you mean, James?

01:09:09.343 --> 01:09:11.787
You know I haven't
worn lipstick for years.

01:09:11.886 --> 01:09:17.211
- Well... your lips are all red.
- Oh!

01:09:18.435 --> 01:09:20.004
Oh, my!

01:09:20.104 --> 01:09:22.343
My gums are bleeding!

01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:27.344
I thought there was a...
a funny taste.

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:34.893
Well Shrinking of gums, causing ill-fitting
dentures. That's... That's what that is.

01:09:34.993 --> 01:09:41.234
Yeah... Better get to the dentist
when the emergency has rescinded.

01:09:41.334 --> 01:09:45.029
There was blood when I went
to the toilet this morning.

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:47.157
Yes, yes. Me, too.

01:09:47.256 --> 01:09:50.457
P-piles, that is. H-hovaloids.

01:09:51.344 --> 01:09:55.332
A common complaint in...
in middle-aged people like ourselves.

01:09:55.432 --> 01:10:03.257
I'll... I'll pop down to... to the chemist
when the crisis pales into insignificance,

01:10:03.357 --> 01:10:07.601
and I'll... I'll get some
of those suppositories.

01:10:09.155 --> 01:10:10.722
Oh!

01:10:10.822 --> 01:10:13.015
Oh, dear.

01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:16.190
I think I'm going to be sick.

01:10:20.541 --> 01:10:23.736
Now, there, there, ducks.
There, there. There, there.

01:10:23.836 --> 01:10:28.616
Now, now. All better now. Now, please.
Don't upset yourself, love.

01:10:28.716 --> 01:10:32.911
Please, please. Now, don't dry.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:37.959
I expect it's due to the vibration,
you know. Like that day in the car.

01:10:38.059 --> 01:10:41.463
You remember that time we
went to Bournemouth, hm?

01:10:41.563 --> 01:10:43.674
And you were sick in the coach.

01:10:43.774 --> 01:10:46.218
Don't worry, ducks. Don't worry.

01:10:46.318 --> 01:10:48.553
There can't be anything
wrong with you.

01:10:48.653 --> 01:10:53.266
I expect it's... it's just the...
the after-effects of the bomb.

01:11:19.852 --> 01:11:25.593
Oh, I... I... I do...
fancy a nice cup of tea.

01:11:27.777 --> 01:11:31.595
Do you think the cows have been
affected by the bomb, dear?

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:35.144
No, I... I shouldn't think so.

01:11:35.244 --> 01:11:37.686
They're... They're all
out in the country.

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:41.525
Supplies of milk will be maintained.

01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:48.159
It is... essential for the maintenance of...
healthy bones and teeth.

01:11:48.882 --> 01:11:51.619
Yes, but we live in
the country, dear.

01:11:51.719 --> 01:11:55.331
Yes, yes, yes, I... I know, dear.

01:11:55.431 --> 01:11:59.047
Well, the grass is
all dead and funny.

01:12:00.019 --> 01:12:02.258
Yes... well...

01:12:03.481 --> 01:12:04.965
I don't know.

01:12:05.065 --> 01:12:11.684
I expect there may be...
a temporary containment of supplies.

01:12:12.448 --> 01:12:16.777
I suppose we'd better just sit
here and wait for help to arrive.

01:12:18.037 --> 01:12:23.360
Yes. The... The emergency services
will have sprung into action

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.488
at the first alarm signal.

01:12:26.588 --> 01:12:29.624
I hope they get here
before the enemy.

01:12:32.051 --> 01:12:37.042
Oh, I... I hope Beryl and
Ron got back all right.

01:12:37.142 --> 01:12:39.878
Oh, they'll... they'll be all right.

01:12:40.811 --> 01:12:45.222
They'll... They'll have been safely
home long... long before the bomb.

01:12:46.609 --> 01:12:49.217
Our Ron's... a sensible boy.

01:12:50.113 --> 01:12:56.101
At the first siren, he'd get the whole
family down to the shelters right away.

01:12:56.994 --> 01:12:59.022
There aren't any shelters, dear.

01:12:59.122 --> 01:13:01.149
Oh, no.

01:13:01.249 --> 01:13:03.774
No, no, I... I forgot.

01:13:04.502 --> 01:13:06.529
But he'll... he'll be all right.

01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:09.699
I gave him the governmental leaflet.

01:13:09.799 --> 01:13:12.161
He'll... He'll be
all right with that.

01:13:12.261 --> 01:13:19.127
That will afford him the maximum
protection available to the populous.

01:13:19.227 --> 01:13:21.670
He'll... He'll take cover immediately

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:27.259
and... adopt all the prescribed
precautionary measures.

01:13:27.359 --> 01:13:29.678
He... He's no fool, our Ron.

01:13:29.778 --> 01:13:33.766
He's not likely to get
hot under the collar.

01:13:33.866 --> 01:13:36.186
He... He won't go to pieces.

01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:40.481
The whole family will...
will stick together.

01:13:40.581 --> 01:13:42.821
Oh! Look!

01:13:43.835 --> 01:13:46.608
There's funny spots on my legs.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:51.326
They're various veins.
That's... That's what that is.

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:54.746
That's... That's a common
complaint amongst...

01:13:54.846 --> 01:13:57.457
amongst the middle-aged
segment of the populous.

01:13:57.557 --> 01:14:00.294
Oh, that's... that's...
that's nothing to worry about.

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:03.047
They don't look like veins to me.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:05.174
I don't like the look of it.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:09.261
Oh... Oh, you are... you are a baby!

01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:12.764
You're a worn... worn...
born worrier, you are, you know.

01:14:12.864 --> 01:14:16.810
Now, you just try and look on
the bright side, eh, ducks? Hm?

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:18.937
Look! Look!

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:22.692
I've even got funny
blotches on my skin, see?

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:25.403
And I... I'm a man.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:30.991
Yes... Yes, too much tinned food.
That's all that is.

01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:33.332
Yes.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.460
Pilchards never did agree with me.

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:41.003
I must put some skin
lotion on those spots.

01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:44.922
Yes. Oh, they'll...
they'll soon clear up.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:48.218
I'll pop down to the chemist...
chemist in the morning.

01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:50.512
I'll get some... get some ointment.

01:14:50.612 --> 01:14:52.639
Yes.

01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:57.980
We could do with some
lozenges or pastilles, too.

01:15:00.247 --> 01:15:04.030
- I've still got a terrible throat.
- Yes, so have I.

01:15:04.918 --> 01:15:06.946
I wonder...

01:15:07.046 --> 01:15:11.034
if they'll be able to
sell us some water.

01:15:11.134 --> 01:15:14.120
I'm going to have an
early night, James.

01:15:15.638 --> 01:15:19.500
We could do with a good long
rest after that blessed bomb.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.755
Oh, yes, yes. It's bound to take
it out of you, a thing like that.

01:15:24.855 --> 01:15:29.006
Yeah, it's a... it's a
shock to the system.

01:15:29.819 --> 01:15:32.263
Oh, yes. I expect so.

01:15:32.363 --> 01:15:35.351
Oh!

01:15:35.451 --> 01:15:37.608
Look!

01:15:38.495 --> 01:15:39.896
My hair's coming out!

01:15:39.996 --> 01:15:42.816
Don't... Don't worry, dearest.

01:15:42.916 --> 01:15:45.028
Don't worry, don't worry.

01:15:45.128 --> 01:15:47.529
Women don't go bald. No!

01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:51.079
That's... That's a scientific fact.

01:15:53.135 --> 01:15:56.706
Shall we get into those
paper bags again?

01:15:56.806 --> 01:15:59.500
Well, whatever for, dear?

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.208
Well, you never know.

01:16:04.688 --> 01:16:07.342
There might be another
one while we're asleep.

01:16:07.442 --> 01:16:10.762
Well, I... I suppose it...
wouldn't hurt.

01:16:10.862 --> 01:16:16.352
It... It would be a...
a sensible precautionary m-measure

01:16:16.452 --> 01:16:19.563
in the... in the...
in the circumstances.

01:16:19.663 --> 01:16:25.610
After all, really, this is
an all-out war situation,

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:27.362
and... Well, I mean,

01:16:27.462 --> 01:16:33.452
another I... IBM... might...
might come over.

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:39.500
Oh, it's stuffy in these bags.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.627
Yes.

01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:46.174
Now you know what it
feels like to be a potato.

01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:51.012
I should hate that,
being buried in the ground.

01:16:51.112 --> 01:16:53.764
Oh, yes. Yes, so would I.

01:16:53.864 --> 01:16:58.228
- Give me... cremation every time.
- Oh, me too.

01:17:01.206 --> 01:17:08.655
We'd better just stay here and wait
for the... emergency services to arrive.

01:17:08.755 --> 01:17:13.202
Y-y-yes. Yes, they'll... they'll take...
they'll take good care of us.

01:17:13.302 --> 01:17:16.075
We won't have to worry about...
about a thing.

01:17:16.805 --> 01:17:20.623
Just... Just leave
everything to them.

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:28.175
The governmental authorities...
will know what to do with us.

01:17:28.275 --> 01:17:30.515
The powers that be...

01:17:31.737 --> 01:17:34.346
will get to us in the end.

01:17:35.325 --> 01:17:40.647
You have got the box with our medical
cards and birth certificates, haven't you?

01:17:40.747 --> 01:17:42.986
Yes, dear, yes.

01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:46.366
They're quite safe.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.406
Shall we pray, dear?

01:17:53.343 --> 01:17:55.370
- Pray?
- Yes.

01:17:55.470 --> 01:18:00.333
Oh, crumbs. Who... Who to?

01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:03.712
Well, God, of course.

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:06.090
Oh... Oh, I see.

01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:12.972
Y-yes. If you think it... it... would be...
would be the correct thing. Hm?

01:18:13.072 --> 01:18:17.060
- It can't do any harm, dear.
- OK.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.810
Here goes.

01:18:21.913 --> 01:18:25.276
Dear... sir...

01:18:25.376 --> 01:18:27.403
No, that's wrong.

01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:31.532
Well... How... How...
How do you start?

01:18:31.632 --> 01:18:33.993
Oh, God...

01:18:34.093 --> 01:18:38.373
Our help... in ages past?

01:18:38.473 --> 01:18:41.246
That's it. Keep it up.

01:18:41.935 --> 01:18:47.508
Almighty and most
merciful Father...

01:18:47.608 --> 01:18:50.135
Oh, that's good.

01:18:50.235 --> 01:18:53.056
Dearly beloved,

01:18:53.156 --> 01:18:59.310
we are gathered...
u-u-unto thee...

01:19:00.078 --> 01:19:03.648
I shall fear no evil.

01:19:04.583 --> 01:19:08.779
Thy rod... and thy staff...
comfort me

01:19:08.879 --> 01:19:13.290
all... the days...
the days of my life.

01:19:14.843 --> 01:19:20.121
L-Lay me down... in...
in green pastures...

01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:25.339
I... I can't remember any more.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.679
That was nice.

01:19:29.509 --> 01:19:32.304
I liked the bit about
the green pasture.

01:19:32.404 --> 01:19:34.431
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

01:19:34.531 --> 01:19:39.773
Into the valley of the
shadow of death...

01:19:41.461 --> 01:19:44.776
No more, love.

01:19:45.376 --> 01:19:48.581
No more.

01:19:58.865 --> 01:20:01.853
<i>Rockabye baby</i>

01:20:02.994 --> 01:20:05.188

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:35.620

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.628
