00:07.001 --> 00:08.761
I'm Elsa Schenthal.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.881
Schenthal Pharmaceuticals

00:10.921 --> 00:13.801
sent a bunch of killers and hitmen
out here to kidnap me.

00:13.841 --> 00:16.561
The circumstances
that created you and me...

00:16.601 --> 00:19.161
The parasite.
Created 18 of you and one of me.

00:19.921 --> 00:21.721
<i>Everyone
that was infected by that parasite</i>

00:21.761 --> 00:24.081
killed someone in order
to pass the infection on...

00:24.121 --> 00:25.321
Not Dan Anderssen.

00:25.361 --> 00:27.041
<i>Latest tissue re-generation</i>

00:27.081 --> 00:30.161
<i>stands at almost 95 per cent.</i>

00:32.761 --> 00:34.561
You broke my nose!

00:34.601 --> 00:37.241
The parasite... I can't fight it
when it grabs me like that.

00:37.281 --> 00:39.881
You are talking to someone.
And someone is answering.

00:39.921 --> 00:42.201
Because you become angry.
Who is answering?

00:42.681 --> 00:44.641
Don't respond.

00:47.121 --> 00:50.081
DCI Myklebust.
Shot in the centre of her forehead.

00:50.121 --> 00:53.401
You're contaminating a murder scene!
I am the interim Governor.

00:53.441 --> 00:55.961
And also the Chief of Fortitude Police.

00:56.001 --> 00:57.841
To the ghost of our memories.

02:06.841 --> 02:09.441
I would have liked to keep the bodies
in situ for longer.

02:10.001 --> 02:12.521
There are too many things to this
that concern me.

02:13.121 --> 02:14.801
And we're rushing the forensics.

02:14.841 --> 02:16.841
Petra and her eyebrow tweezers...

02:17.801 --> 02:18.961
What?

02:19.001 --> 02:21.481
Well, that's forensics in Fortitude,
somebody once said.

02:21.521 --> 02:22.961
Somebody who's probably dead?

02:24.721 --> 02:26.121
What concerns you, Eric?

02:28.321 --> 02:33.201
Well, for starters the idea that Lars
Ulvinaune shot two people dead.

02:33.241 --> 02:34.481
That concerns me.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.441
What were the Oslo investigators
doing out here?

02:37.481 --> 02:39.001
Arresting Lars.

02:39.041 --> 02:41.321
Why were they arresting Lars Ulvinaune?

02:41.721 --> 02:43.521
The nicest man in Fortitude.

02:43.561 --> 02:45.801
Somebody must have given them his name.

02:46.961 --> 02:48.961
Who would do such a thing?

02:49.961 --> 02:51.481
To a fellow citizen.

02:53.161 --> 02:55.121
Or...

02:55.161 --> 02:58.481
Lars brewed the reindeer juice
in industrial quantities.

02:58.921 --> 03:00.321
Eric.

03:00.361 --> 03:04.321
You told them reindeer juice was a cause
of Governor Munk's suicidal death leap.

03:06.121 --> 03:08.121
Well, that's the reason, then?

03:12.081 --> 03:13.961
We should get going.

03:14.441 --> 03:16.601
There's no room in here for you.

03:16.641 --> 03:17.881
Bodies are priority.

03:18.801 --> 03:20.801
What? There is plenty of room.

03:21.281 --> 03:24.401
You can ride with me in the ice cruiser
the dead people came out in.

05:02.441 --> 05:04.361
Dan Anderssen...

05:06.641 --> 05:09.321
Tell me, why did you
mention the reindeer juice?

05:10.401 --> 05:14.481
Because Eric was about to realise that
you grassed up Lars and got him killed.

05:16.801 --> 05:18.801
So you were protecting me?

05:19.201 --> 05:21.201
You're the Governor.

05:22.321 --> 05:24.681
- And you are the Sheriff.
- Mm.

05:24.721 --> 05:26.721
That's how it works.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.201
It's not personal, Markus.

05:29.481 --> 05:32.361
It's a fixed law
of the world we live in.

05:32.401 --> 05:33.681
The roles we have.

05:33.961 --> 05:36.601
Oh, yeah. I understand.

05:37.881 --> 05:42.641
So you must also understand that I sent
Myklebust and Oby out to Lars' cabin.

05:44.561 --> 05:47.601
I got there before them
and murdered Lars.

05:48.161 --> 05:50.161
Strangled him in his bed.

05:50.881 --> 05:53.161
And when the investigators arrived

05:53.481 --> 05:55.201
I shot Sergeant Oby

05:55.241 --> 05:58.001
and then I shot
Detective Inspector Myklebust

05:58.601 --> 06:02.361
and then I shot Lars' corpse...

06:03.201 --> 06:04.921
through the throat

06:04.961 --> 06:06.961
to hide the marks of strangulation.

06:11.641 --> 06:13.641
The bruises my thumbs made.

06:15.201 --> 06:18.881
I don't recollect you ever committing
any murders on my behalf.

06:19.481 --> 06:20.521
There's still time.

06:22.121 --> 06:24.401
Pardon?
I'm talking to the Governor.

06:30.361 --> 06:32.281
Yes.

06:32.321 --> 06:33.601
You are.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.721
Huh.

06:45.281 --> 06:49.161
Lars killed them?
Yes, that's what it looks like.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.961
Lars the snow plough driver...

06:51.001 --> 06:53.001
- I know.
- Jesus.

06:54.121 --> 06:56.121
So, now, who attacked you?

06:57.881 --> 07:01.081
Oh, no, it was nothing.
It was just a misunderstanding.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.361
Yeah, silly.

07:02.401 --> 07:03.561
Who with?

07:03.601 --> 07:05.657
The orderly said you were
assaulted by a trawler man.

07:05.681 --> 07:07.961
Er, yes, a big Russian.

07:10.081 --> 07:13.681
There aren't any Russian boats
in Fortitude just now.

07:15.321 --> 07:17.321
- Well...
- What did he look like?

07:18.121 --> 07:20.241
- Big.
- Big?

07:21.001 --> 07:22.321
Mm.

07:22.361 --> 07:26.281
And like he...
like he worked with his hands

07:26.321 --> 07:29.041
on a big fish-trawling vessel.

07:29.481 --> 07:31.641
And this happened in the Blue Fox?

07:31.681 --> 07:32.801
Yes.

07:32.841 --> 07:34.001
- In the toilet?
- Yep.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.921
Had you been drinking heavily?

07:40.201 --> 07:42.481
I suppose I had been drinking...

07:51.521 --> 07:53.921
I'm not going to enter
any of this shit in my notebook.

07:53.961 --> 07:56.441
When you want to tell me
the truth about what happened

07:56.481 --> 07:58.561
then come and find me
in the police station.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.001
Markus.
I'm here in my capacity as Governor.

08:26.241 --> 08:27.841
OK, Governor.

08:28.761 --> 08:31.601
Eric Odegard, we have to talk.

08:43.001 --> 08:46.481
After what you saw today,
you probably need a drink.

08:48.401 --> 08:50.401
Indeed, yes.

08:51.241 --> 08:54.241
In my former capacity
as a school teacher.

08:54.761 --> 08:56.681
I rarely witnessed such carnage.

09:08.561 --> 09:14.281
Sheriff Anderssen said some things to me
on the drive back from the murder scene.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.921
- He did?
- Mm.

09:15.961 --> 09:17.961
Yes, and after what he told me.

09:19.241 --> 09:21.801
I felt it incumbent upon myself
as Governor

09:21.841 --> 09:23.841
er, to telephone Oslo.

09:24.321 --> 09:25.601
And what did you tell them?

09:25.641 --> 09:28.441
That the Fortitude Police
were absolutely satisfied

09:28.481 --> 09:32.921
that a tragic shooting had resulted in
the deaths of all three people concerned

09:32.961 --> 09:36.241
and, as such, we were
not looking for any further suspects.

09:37.961 --> 09:39.841
Dan told you to say this?

09:39.881 --> 09:41.361
No.

09:41.401 --> 09:45.401
No, I was speaking to Oslo
in my own capacity as Governor

09:45.761 --> 09:47.481
based on my own conclusions.

09:47.521 --> 09:50.401
Markus, you have
no experience whatsoever

09:50.441 --> 09:53.521
in any shape or form
in matters of police investigation.

09:53.561 --> 09:54.801
- Governor.
- What?

09:54.841 --> 09:57.121
You said Markus.
You continue to say Markus.

09:57.161 --> 10:00.881
I'm speaking here, now, to you,
as your Governor.

10:00.921 --> 10:02.201
The Governor of Fortitude.

10:02.241 --> 10:04.601
Fuck that! Fuck you, Markus Huseklepp!

10:04.641 --> 10:06.841
You ridiculous, jumped-up pipsqueak!

10:10.361 --> 10:12.161
- What?
- You fucking heard me!

10:25.921 --> 10:28.521
There is another matter

10:28.801 --> 10:30.881
that I discussed with Oslo.

10:33.601 --> 10:34.801
The Governor's residence

10:36.161 --> 10:38.161
i.e., this house

10:39.161 --> 10:44.161
is a conditional sine qua non
of the interim Governor's office.

10:44.961 --> 10:48.481
Now, it has been nine weeks
since the previous Governor

10:48.521 --> 10:51.041
i.e. your wife, Hildur Odegard

10:51.081 --> 10:53.641
vacated this residence.

10:53.681 --> 10:56.521
And so, in accordance
to Oslo's directive.

10:57.681 --> 11:00.361
I am willing to give you 48 hours

11:00.401 --> 11:03.161
to make alternative
accommodation arrangements

11:03.521 --> 11:05.361
before I move in.

11:05.401 --> 11:10.041
So that would be
"Fuck you, Governor Huseklepp!"

11:25.401 --> 11:27.401
Boyd!

11:34.601 --> 11:36.601
Boyd!

12:23.881 --> 12:25.881
Boyd...

12:26.561 --> 12:28.561
Elsa.

12:30.121 --> 12:32.121
Elsa.

12:32.521 --> 12:35.601
He's gone. I'm sorry, Elsa.

12:35.641 --> 12:37.441
OK, stop talking.

12:37.481 --> 12:40.201
You've lost a lot of blood.
I need to get to work.

12:40.241 --> 12:42.041
- Not got long.
- Shut up.

12:42.081 --> 12:44.001
Shut up, Boyd!
You need to do it, hun.

12:44.041 --> 12:46.041
My time's up.

12:47.601 --> 12:51.081
I want you to take... take...
take what I have left.

12:52.681 --> 12:54.681
Yeah, Elsa.

12:56.201 --> 12:58.241
My love.

13:01.641 --> 13:02.641
Do it!

13:09.961 --> 13:11.681
Elsa...

13:11.721 --> 13:13.321
Hey, my love.

13:45.961 --> 13:47.121
Thank you.

13:47.161 --> 13:49.121
Where do you want to go?

13:49.161 --> 13:51.161
Hotel called the Blue Fox, please.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.961
Finest hostelry in Fortitude.

13:55.681 --> 13:57.681
That's nice to know.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.881
Very nice indeed.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.961
Hair of the dog.
Get it over with, Dad.

14:19.761 --> 14:23.001
Don't mind me.
There's beer and vodka in the fridge.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.561
I didn't make you any breakfast.

14:24.601 --> 14:26.601
Pointless waste of time and money.

14:28.001 --> 14:31.281
Oh, and antifreeze in the outhouse
if you run out of booze.

14:33.521 --> 14:37.041
I went to the Fox... for a drink.

14:40.881 --> 14:44.561
A woman sat down... and we talked.

14:46.641 --> 14:48.681
- A woman?
- She was...

14:48.721 --> 14:50.201
very beautiful.

14:50.241 --> 14:52.241
She was...

14:53.361 --> 14:54.801
Just a... I dunno...

14:54.841 --> 14:57.761
Someone from somewhere else. Like...

14:58.881 --> 15:02.201
And I had to go to the men's room...

15:02.681 --> 15:04.281
Uh-huh.

15:04.321 --> 15:08.121
Where I was chloroformed

15:08.161 --> 15:11.601
and I woke up, hog-tied and vomiting...

15:11.641 --> 15:12.521
Stop.

15:12.561 --> 15:17.361
The man who chloroformed me,
he threw a goddamn hammer at me.

15:17.401 --> 15:19.161
You fell over drunk.

15:20.481 --> 15:22.561
- I was drunk.
- Yeah.

15:22.601 --> 15:24.481
I was hung upside down.

15:24.521 --> 15:27.601
I fought this man for my goddam life

15:27.641 --> 15:30.521
and then I think that I killed him.

15:33.361 --> 15:37.321
I need your help to find the place
where this all happened.

15:39.921 --> 15:43.161
Dad, I'm going to show you right now
the place where all this happened.

15:43.201 --> 15:46.241
Using all the experience I've gained
in this house as your daughter.

15:46.281 --> 15:47.561
Don't say that shit, Ingrid.

15:47.601 --> 15:50.161
It happened in here!
I know what you think! It happened!

15:53.681 --> 15:54.681
Come in!

15:59.281 --> 16:01.281
Is everything OK?

16:02.001 --> 16:05.561
Yeah. He says he got in a fight
and killed a man.

16:06.481 --> 16:08.521
- That's awful.
- Yeah, it is.

16:08.921 --> 16:12.521
But it makes him look like a big, brave
adventurer instead of a sad drunk.

16:12.561 --> 16:14.481
Come on.

16:14.521 --> 16:16.361
See you later, Mr Lennox.

16:24.761 --> 16:27.681
Have you experienced
Arctic conditions before?

16:27.721 --> 16:29.001
I've read up on it.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.921
That's not the same.

16:30.961 --> 16:32.961
I believe I'll need a body suit.

16:33.001 --> 16:36.201
What are you?
About five foot seven, 110 pounds?

16:36.241 --> 16:38.041
Hundred and twenty.

16:49.001 --> 16:51.001
And a gun.

16:51.521 --> 16:53.081
Hunting rifle?

16:53.121 --> 16:54.681
Hand-gun.

16:54.721 --> 16:56.721
.44 revolver.

16:57.161 --> 17:00.001
A Magnum will stop a polar bear
if that's what you're worried about

17:00.041 --> 17:04.281
but I'd always recommend a hunting
calibre rifle like a Winchester M70

17:04.320 --> 17:05.800
or a Remington 700.

17:05.840 --> 17:10.521
I want a SIG Sauer P226 X5 tactical

17:10.560 --> 17:13.601
with a custom Hogue Grip
and tritium sights.

17:13.881 --> 17:19.401
And a box of 9-mil 147-grain
V-crown jacketed hollow-points.

17:20.241 --> 17:22.241
You read a book about guns as well?

17:25.921 --> 17:27.921
Heard about them from a friend.

18:22.881 --> 18:24.121
Open.

18:24.161 --> 18:26.961
One for the helicopter pilot?

18:27.721 --> 18:29.921
Did you used to play that game
with your mum?

18:29.961 --> 18:33.641
You've obviously never met my mum.

18:33.681 --> 18:36.321
I think it's maybe just
about over, Vincent.

18:36.361 --> 18:37.921
What is?

18:37.961 --> 18:39.841
The parasite infestation.

18:39.881 --> 18:41.961
I think I might have purged it last night.

18:42.001 --> 18:45.481
I have more and more visual information
on each retina.

18:45.521 --> 18:48.281
Not just light and dark.

18:49.241 --> 18:51.641
I'm beginning to sense movement too.

18:51.681 --> 18:54.001
- Really?
- Yes, really.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.481
That's great.

18:55.521 --> 18:59.041
So I think that the parasite's
malevolent influence has passed

18:59.081 --> 19:01.481
and I'm now beginning to experience
the healing effects

19:01.521 --> 19:03.441
same as Dan did and...

19:03.481 --> 19:06.281
And I'm not having
any violent urges at all.

19:07.401 --> 19:08.801
It's the opposite, in fact.

19:08.841 --> 19:10.961
I feel calm and relaxed.

19:12.801 --> 19:15.201
The happiest I've felt for ages, Vincent.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.201
Light at the end of the tunnel.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.521
That's it.

19:20.561 --> 19:21.921
No, that's very well put.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.521
Also...

19:23.561 --> 19:26.721
These are, like, really digging into
my wrist, quite painfully.

19:26.761 --> 19:30.841
I mean, I'm not sure they're completely
100 per cent necessary any more.

19:31.401 --> 19:33.601
- No?
- No, I mean...

19:33.641 --> 19:36.361
we could keep them on...

19:36.401 --> 19:38.881
I think it would be OK
if you take them off.

19:38.921 --> 19:40.121
Do you?

19:40.161 --> 19:42.161
Open.

19:44.321 --> 19:45.481
I think we'll keep them on.

19:46.521 --> 19:48.481
OK.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.521
No, that's OK.

19:51.121 --> 19:53.121
But... can I ask...

19:53.441 --> 19:57.761
are you actually maybe beginning
to enjoy this a little bit?

19:59.161 --> 20:01.281
What bit of this are you referring to?

20:01.321 --> 20:02.961
This... helplessness.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.041
My helplessness.

20:05.521 --> 20:07.841
A helpless woman
strapped to a bed in your basement.

20:07.881 --> 20:10.121
Natalie... Open wide.
Yeah, exactly.

20:10.161 --> 20:12.641
It's a bit... Exactly.
It's a bit sexual, isn't it?

20:12.681 --> 20:13.921
Natalie.

20:13.961 --> 20:15.801
You pretend this doesn't turn you on.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.697
Open your mouth and drink your soup.
Or what? You'll give me a spanking?

20:18.721 --> 20:20.081
Stop it.

20:20.121 --> 20:22.041
Then untie me.

20:22.081 --> 20:24.241
I'm not going to untie you.
This isn't healthy.

20:24.361 --> 20:27.761
You're bloody telling me it isn't!
You know, anyone finds me here

20:27.801 --> 20:30.801
you're in such fucking trouble,
you can't imagine.

20:31.641 --> 20:36.641
How the fuck do you explain having a
woman all bondaged up in your basement?

20:36.681 --> 20:38.481
This - this was all your idea!

20:38.521 --> 20:40.161
Do you think that's gonna work?

20:40.201 --> 20:42.281
Right now my idea is that we end this

20:42.321 --> 20:44.761
because either it hasn't worked

20:44.801 --> 20:46.801
or I've changed my mind
or whatever the fuck

20:46.841 --> 20:49.681
but I'm telling you now my idea now
is that you fucking let me go!

20:49.721 --> 20:51.961
I'm not going to let you go.
You fucking pervert!

20:52.001 --> 20:54.001
All right, I think we're done here.

20:55.361 --> 20:57.481
Did you fuck me?
That's enough chicken soup.

20:57.521 --> 20:59.041
- When I was delirious.
- No.

20:59.081 --> 21:01.081
I think you did. Well, I didn't.

21:01.601 --> 21:03.841
Did you dream about it, though?

21:03.881 --> 21:05.241
- Stop it.
- Same thing.

21:05.281 --> 21:08.721
Natalie...
Wank yourself off thinking about it?

21:08.761 --> 21:11.681
You fucking pervert!
You fucking sleazy fuck!

21:11.721 --> 21:13.097
You know what I thought,
I thought this would be like...

21:13.121 --> 21:14.761
Ulysses and the sirens.
Fuck you!

21:14.801 --> 21:17.441
Their beautiful entreaties.
You fucking sleazy...

21:17.481 --> 21:19.041
- Fuck you!
- The sirens weren't

21:19.081 --> 21:22.721
a bunch of foul-mouthed,
twisted fucking psycho bitches.

21:24.321 --> 21:25.801
Don't you go.

21:25.841 --> 21:27.841
Don't you fucking leave me here!

21:29.201 --> 21:31.201
Don't you abandon me!

21:32.841 --> 21:34.841
Vincent...

21:35.561 --> 21:37.561
Vincent?

21:38.041 --> 21:40.041
Vincent!

21:40.921 --> 21:42.041
Vincent!

21:43.161 --> 21:44.801
Vincent!

21:45.401 --> 21:47.441
Vincent!

21:47.481 --> 21:48.881
Vincent...

21:48.921 --> 21:51.481
Don't you fucking abandon me!

21:51.521 --> 21:53.521
Vincent!

21:54.161 --> 21:56.161
Vincent...

21:56.641 --> 21:58.601
Vincent!

21:58.641 --> 22:00.801
Oh, fuck...

22:00.841 --> 22:02.841
Vincent...

22:27.681 --> 22:29.681
Michael?

22:30.441 --> 22:31.921
Put down the gun.

22:33.001 --> 22:34.321
It's not a gun.

22:34.361 --> 22:36.241
Whatever the fuck it is, put it down.

22:49.481 --> 22:53.601
I'm not trying to get you drunk
but I'm going to help myself to a drink.

22:56.601 --> 22:58.601
Would you like to join me in a drink?

23:04.481 --> 23:06.401
What happened to the black guy?

23:06.921 --> 23:08.921
What happened to him?

23:10.081 --> 23:12.601
- He met me.
- Don't fuck around!

23:18.681 --> 23:20.681
Boyd Mulvihill.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.801
He was my...

23:26.721 --> 23:28.961
He was my husband
for the last nine years.

23:29.561 --> 23:32.961
He was loving, sexy, smart, tough.

23:33.201 --> 23:35.521
He'd been a doctor
in the US Marine Corps.

23:37.401 --> 23:41.201
You nearly ended his life, then I did.

23:46.081 --> 23:47.641
You killed him?

23:47.681 --> 23:49.681
I've killed lots of people.

23:51.241 --> 23:52.921
I was about to kill you.

23:56.121 --> 23:58.281
Boyd was dying from his injuries.

23:58.321 --> 24:01.041
I know you're badly alcoholic right now...

24:04.201 --> 24:06.801
But don't worry, I can change that.

24:25.001 --> 24:28.041
If you do the powder burn test,
I can get started on Oby.

24:28.481 --> 24:30.641
You're very cheerful.

24:30.681 --> 24:32.681
Me?

24:33.241 --> 24:35.241
No, I'm not.

24:37.481 --> 24:39.201
You told me you were so terribly lonely

24:39.241 --> 24:43.241
because the only intimacy you ever had
was with dead people. Remember?

24:43.761 --> 24:45.761
- Well?
- Well...

24:46.321 --> 24:49.601
Well, now you have a fucking orgy
of death and intimacy in your mortuary

24:49.641 --> 24:51.641
with three brand-new corpses.

24:52.361 --> 24:54.361
Ingrid, what's wrong with you?

24:57.001 --> 24:59.001
Why did you tell Lars to leave town?

25:00.521 --> 25:03.081
Because Lars would have
given them the names.

25:03.121 --> 25:06.241
What names?
The ones who killed Governor Munk.

25:06.281 --> 25:08.601
You want to protect
the men who killed Munk.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.641
Killing him was justice.

25:10.681 --> 25:14.161
And there was no other way justice
would have ever found Erling Munk.

25:14.761 --> 25:16.401
You sound like Dan.

25:16.441 --> 25:18.641
Just like Dan.

25:19.041 --> 25:22.001
Maybe Dan is what
justice fucking sounds like.

25:22.041 --> 25:24.761
No, Petra.
Madness is what Dan sounds like.

25:24.801 --> 25:26.881
Am I the only one who can see this?

25:26.921 --> 25:28.801
Dan has never been more sane.

25:28.841 --> 25:31.841
You're only saying that
because you're fucking him.

25:32.441 --> 25:34.241
So you're saying

25:34.281 --> 25:36.041
if he's fucking me

25:36.081 --> 25:38.081
he has to be mad, huh?

25:40.081 --> 25:42.361
What if there is some other explanation?

25:42.921 --> 25:44.081
Explanation?

25:44.121 --> 25:46.401
What if Dan Anderssen...

25:46.441 --> 25:48.481
loves Petra Bergen?

25:48.961 --> 25:49.961
Loves you?

25:50.721 --> 25:52.881
I owe my life to Dan.

25:52.921 --> 25:54.561
Everybody does.

25:54.601 --> 25:56.761
I surrender myself to him, Ingrid.

25:56.801 --> 26:00.321
All life around us flows from Dan.

26:00.361 --> 26:02.881
You mean death, Petra.
That's what's flowing.

26:02.921 --> 26:05.241
All the life and all the love.

26:05.281 --> 26:07.761
I closed the door on loneliness
when Dan came back.

26:08.401 --> 26:11.201
Now, I am his because he is mine.

26:17.641 --> 26:21.001
Why was I strung up like a pig

26:21.041 --> 26:24.041
ready to be bled dry
upside down in the dirt?

26:24.721 --> 26:25.961
It keeps me alive.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.721
What does?

26:27.761 --> 26:31.321
A distillation of human
cerebrospinal fluid.

26:32.601 --> 26:35.041
It contains pluripotent stem cells.

26:36.081 --> 26:40.241
So Boyd Mulvihill... did he donate?

26:41.881 --> 26:43.921
Yes.

26:43.961 --> 26:44.961
Before he died.

26:48.241 --> 26:49.241
Tell me about Freya.

26:52.881 --> 26:54.401
What?

26:54.441 --> 26:56.441
What happened to her?

26:57.841 --> 26:59.121
She was my wife.

26:59.161 --> 27:01.361
And now she's gone?

27:01.401 --> 27:05.161
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
happened to Freya.

27:07.681 --> 27:09.681
Mm.

27:10.001 --> 27:12.561
Mortality within
three years of diagnosis.

27:12.961 --> 27:14.961
It happened a lot quicker than that.

27:20.361 --> 27:24.441
I was so peachy last night,
and now look.

27:33.001 --> 27:35.001
What... What is that?

27:35.481 --> 27:36.641
It's recent.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.081
Something's going wrong.

27:41.801 --> 27:43.241
What do you want?

27:43.761 --> 27:44.801
Want?

27:46.361 --> 27:48.361
A small-town drunk.

27:48.641 --> 27:50.761
Drinking and fighting.

27:51.041 --> 27:52.721
Couldn't save Freya.

27:57.481 --> 27:59.481
That's what you wanted.

28:00.841 --> 28:02.161
That's right.

28:02.201 --> 28:04.201
All you wanted?

28:05.721 --> 28:07.441
Yes.

28:08.401 --> 28:09.801
So what's left?

28:16.161 --> 28:17.681
Nothing's left.

28:20.001 --> 28:21.401
You want me.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.241
You?

28:23.561 --> 28:24.561
You can have me.

28:26.201 --> 28:28.241
Have you like Boyd had you?

28:28.281 --> 28:30.281
Exactly like Boyd had me.

28:30.321 --> 28:32.321
And I'll end up like Boyd?

28:33.361 --> 28:34.761
How else?

28:47.881 --> 28:49.161
Undress for me.

28:54.161 --> 28:56.161
Show me what you are.

28:58.481 --> 29:00.041
Both of us.

29:01.201 --> 29:03.201
Underneath everything.

29:07.281 --> 29:10.641
Or maybe, I'll just shoot you
in your fucking head

29:10.681 --> 29:13.641
and walk out of here
and back into the real world.

29:17.201 --> 29:19.361
Maybe you will.

29:47.641 --> 29:49.201
Boyd did this?

29:49.241 --> 29:51.401
And then you killed him.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.201
No, you did.

30:05.361 --> 30:12.001
The only way to survive loneliness
is to find someone you can share it with.

30:53.761 --> 30:56.561
Yeah. Me neither.

31:01.441 --> 31:05.921
Those refuse sacks might float
when the tissues start to decompose.

31:05.961 --> 31:07.721
It releases gas.

31:07.761 --> 31:09.841
Even if we weigh him down with chains.

31:11.041 --> 31:14.761
I think I'm gonna take him out the bags
and wrap him in chicken mesh.

31:14.801 --> 31:16.881
Chicken mesh? Shrimp and crabs.

31:16.921 --> 31:21.481
Various scavenging isopods,
they can strip the meat right off the bone.

31:21.521 --> 31:22.641
Oh.

31:22.681 --> 31:26.081
Some parcels might even be
swallowed whole by Greenland shark.

31:27.521 --> 31:30.441
Greenland shark?
I've never heard of a Greenland shark.

31:30.481 --> 31:31.841
Uh?

31:31.881 --> 31:33.721
Boyd would like that.

31:45.001 --> 31:46.761
- Vincent?
- I'm so sorry.

31:46.801 --> 31:48.721
That was my fault.

31:48.761 --> 31:49.961
I've got a lot on my mind.

31:50.481 --> 31:51.681
Thank fuck you're not drunk.

31:53.961 --> 31:57.761
Take the earplugs out your ears!
Huh?

32:04.601 --> 32:07.401
- Who is that?
- Vincent Rattrey.

32:07.441 --> 32:09.681
He's a scientist. Bears and shit.

32:09.721 --> 32:12.201
Used to be hooked up
with that blonde girl.

32:12.241 --> 32:13.321
Natalie.

32:13.921 --> 32:15.241
She went blind.

32:15.281 --> 32:19.361
Yeah, some shit at work fucked her up.

32:20.961 --> 32:22.361
What kind of shit fucked her up?

32:22.401 --> 32:25.641
She worked with that Dr Khatri.

32:26.841 --> 32:28.841
They worked together.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.281
Let me out here.

32:34.161 --> 32:35.161
What's going on?

32:37.041 --> 32:40.441
You take care of Boyd
and then you go back to the house.

33:20.241 --> 33:22.241
Vincent?

33:32.241 --> 33:33.361
Vincent!

33:33.401 --> 33:35.401
Open up, Vincent! It's Ingrid.

33:35.441 --> 33:36.721
Let me in!

34:21.440 --> 34:22.481
Lay on the floor!

34:24.041 --> 34:26.801
What the hell is going on?
Get on the fucking floor!

34:26.841 --> 34:28.521
You smashed my window.

34:28.561 --> 34:30.241
Get on the fucking floor!

34:30.281 --> 34:31.880
Face down now, you fucker!

34:34.201 --> 34:35.960
Get on the floor!
Don't be ridiculous.

34:38.481 --> 34:41.201
Face down now
with your fingers laced together

34:41.241 --> 34:44.400
behind the back of your head back...

34:46.360 --> 34:48.081
I'm marinating these for my dinner.

34:50.641 --> 34:52.440
Yeah?

34:52.481 --> 34:54.121
Butchered this little fella
the other day.

34:56.481 --> 34:58.801
Been too busy to clean up the sink, Ingrid.

34:59.281 --> 35:00.401
So shoot me.

35:04.761 --> 35:06.841
I heard a woman scream.

35:09.801 --> 35:11.801
There's no woman here.

35:14.121 --> 35:15.121
Just you and me.

35:19.361 --> 35:21.361
All right?

35:26.241 --> 35:28.121
Lars would never shoot anyone.

35:29.041 --> 35:30.481
That's what I thought too.

35:31.921 --> 35:35.121
And Eric, he is broken.

35:36.601 --> 35:38.601
Dan has gone crazy.

35:39.921 --> 35:41.681
It's your dad, isn't it?

35:43.201 --> 35:45.761
- What?
- Your dad.

35:45.801 --> 35:48.921
What about him?
That's what's really upsetting you.

35:50.521 --> 35:52.361
He nearly ran me over.

35:53.281 --> 35:55.281
- When?
- Just now.

36:00.641 --> 36:02.041
Vincent...

36:03.481 --> 36:06.121
What am I going to do about my poor dad?

36:07.361 --> 36:09.161
It's OK. It's OK.

36:09.561 --> 36:11.641
- Vincent.
- Ssh.

36:11.881 --> 36:13.881
- I know.
- I heard something.

41:06.361 --> 41:07.601
<i>Please say your name.</i>

41:07.641 --> 41:10.481

41:12.281 --> 41:13.761

41:13.801 --> 41:15.241
<i>Not authorised.</i>

41:16.441 --> 41:18.441
<i>Please say your name.</i>

Surinder Khatri.

41:34.241 --> 41:36.081
<i>Initial testing confirmed</i>

41:36.121 --> 41:39.401
<i>the most significant reaction
to the parasite infestation</i>

41:39.441 --> 41:42.001
<i>was a capacity to regenerate
damaged tissue.</i>

41:42.881 --> 41:45.881
<i>I observed this
in the Elena Ledesma patient.</i>

41:48.241 --> 41:50.441
<i>Removal of sections
of her liver tissue</i>

41:50.481 --> 41:53.521
<i>was followed by complete
regeneration of the organ.</i>

41:53.881 --> 41:56.961
<i>The cumulative effect of this surgery
should have killed her.</i>

41:57.001 --> 41:59.841
<i>But it didn't. She died, though, after.</i>

42:00.361 --> 42:01.561
<i>Also in Dan Anderssen,</i>

42:01.601 --> 42:05.041
<i>after his crucifixion, his wounds healed.</i>

42:05.081 --> 42:06.761
<i>But what of his mind?</i>

42:06.801 --> 42:08.761
<i>Because at the same time,
as every subject</i>

42:08.801 --> 42:12.161
<i>experienced the benefit
of tissue regeneration</i>

42:12.201 --> 42:14.601
<i>it can be confirmed that in the majority</i>

42:15.081 --> 42:18.281
<i>this was offset
by a psychological collapse.</i>

42:18.321 --> 42:20.841
<i>By a clearly observed
confusion of memory</i>

42:20.881 --> 42:22.801
<i>emotion and personality.</i>

42:23.601 --> 42:25.441
<i>A degeneration of human empathy,</i>

42:25.481 --> 42:27.481
<i>which appeared to be inexorably followed</i>

42:27.521 --> 42:30.881
<i>by a hideous descent
into psychosis and psychopathy.</i>

42:35.281 --> 42:37.801
<i>And as far as I was able to ascertain</i>

42:37.841 --> 42:40.281
<i>in all cases this was irreversible</i>

42:40.321 --> 42:42.641
<i>and resulted in
a destruction of intellect</i>

42:42.681 --> 42:44.761
<i>and disintegration of personality</i>

42:45.241 --> 42:48.321
<i>finally manifest
in a tragic pattern of confusion</i>

42:48.361 --> 42:50.361
<i>delusion and self-deception.</i>

42:52.641 --> 42:54.601
<i>But the worst, to my mind...</i>

42:55.121 --> 42:58.841
<i>The one subject who survived
beyond an allotted human lifespan</i>

42:58.881 --> 43:04.121
<i>finally endured an agonising
and catastrophic deliquescence.</i>

43:04.721 --> 43:07.721
<i>A disintegration, a falling apart.</i>

43:07.761 --> 43:11.881
<i>A horrible, unstoppable slide
into agony and collapse</i>

43:11.921 --> 43:15.121
<i>as the component parts
that make us human</i>

43:15.161 --> 43:17.721
<i>separate and dissolve forever.</i>

43:22.001 --> 43:25.241
<i>This is Freya. Please leave a message.</i>

43:25.281 --> 43:27.281
Hey, kiddo.

43:32.801 --> 43:35.601
I just wanted to say to you...

43:39.201 --> 43:42.201
Anything that's happening...

43:43.761 --> 43:46.801
Anything you see going on down here...

43:49.401 --> 43:51.401
See...

43:52.481 --> 43:57.441
I've got a chance
to maybe make things right.

43:59.921 --> 44:04.201
To fix the stuff

44:04.241 --> 44:08.361
that I couldn't fix for you.

45:28.041 --> 45:30.041
Vincent...

45:38.161 --> 45:41.681
Hildur would cook... while I...

45:41.721 --> 45:43.721
made cocktails.

45:43.761 --> 45:46.721
Last night Ingeborg's body
was taken from the mortuary.

45:46.761 --> 45:48.921
I think it was Dan Anderssen

45:48.961 --> 45:50.617
who took her.
Why would he take her body?

45:50.641 --> 45:52.321
I think he is completely mad.

45:52.361 --> 45:56.881
Did Natalie... have... a... parasite

45:57.801 --> 45:58.841
inside her?

45:59.081 --> 46:01.041
Somebody please help me! Please!
