WEBVTT

00:33.827 --> 00:35.120
Here to the right.

00:48.466 --> 00:49.466
Stop.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.181
Stay here.

01:06.943 --> 01:08.528
Who's there?

01:10.947 --> 01:14.617
Relax, sir. We come in peace.

01:14.701 --> 01:15.910
Stay right there!

01:18.121 --> 01:19.414
Relax.

01:27.422 --> 01:29.174
How are the cows?

01:55.700 --> 02:00.038
The cops came here... a few months ago.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.706
What did you tell them?

02:02.540 --> 02:03.958
The truth.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.506
That I haven't seen you in years.

02:13.635 --> 02:15.929
You've gotten old, Pablo.

02:21.601 --> 02:22.977
It happens.

02:23.937 --> 02:25.522
You look younger.

02:26.481 --> 02:27.816
That happens.

02:29.108 --> 02:33.613
Life in the country keeps you young.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.619
Be careful, it's hot.

02:41.412 --> 02:43.164
What's your name?

02:45.542 --> 02:46.709
Limón, sir.

02:47.377 --> 02:50.672
Don't give me that shit.
What's your real name?

02:50.755 --> 02:52.799
- Jhon.
- Jhon.

02:52.882 --> 02:55.260
Do you know how to milk a cow, Jhon?

02:55.343 --> 02:58.638
- No, sir.
- Well, you better learn.

03:01.724 --> 03:03.601
All right, gentlemen.

03:05.478 --> 03:07.772
I get up at 5:00 a.m.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.692
Good night.

03:11.568 --> 03:13.278
Good night, Dad.

05:51.436 --> 05:56.858
It is the state, not individuals,
that has justice in its hands

05:56.941 --> 05:58.443
and the legitimacy to use arms.

06:34.604 --> 06:37.815
Gilberto's no longer our partner.
I don't care what he thinks.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.318
Have you seen the news?

06:40.401 --> 06:43.362
They issued a statement without us.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.406
Los Pepes is done.

06:46.407 --> 06:50.078
That's only for show.
The Castaños are still in Medellín.

06:51.704 --> 06:53.081
No one told me anything.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.417
Listen to me, Berna.

06:56.501 --> 06:59.796
If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll kill him ourselves.

06:59.879 --> 07:01.756
We don't need anybody else.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.217
Start moving this product now.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.135
That's all fine, Judy.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.930
But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

07:09.013 --> 07:13.059
Did you know they're offering
$1.4 billion for Los Pepes?

07:13.810 --> 07:15.436
I know where they are.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.691
Be careful what you say.

07:21.359 --> 07:24.237
That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

07:24.904 --> 07:26.989
I'm not interested in the reward.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.826
I'm interested in my labs.

07:31.828 --> 07:33.913
Then at least tell Gilberto yourself.

07:40.086 --> 07:41.086
<i>Sir?</i>

07:44.757 --> 07:45.800
Hello.

07:48.261 --> 07:50.555
And to what do I owe this lovely surprise?

07:50.638 --> 07:53.724
We're at the warehouse in Manrique.

07:53.808 --> 07:55.476
This place is full of product.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.979
<i>What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?</i>

07:58.062 --> 08:02.150
Keep it. Think of it as a contribution
to your great cause

08:02.233 --> 08:04.569
against the communists in the jungle.

08:04.652 --> 08:09.031
I'm sure you'll find its value
can be put to good use.

08:09.115 --> 08:10.449
<i>And what do we do about Judy?</i>

08:10.533 --> 08:12.827
<i>Do whatever you think is best.</i>

08:12.910 --> 08:16.455
Well, Gilberto, if you say so.
Thank you very much.

08:18.166 --> 08:22.461
Fidel. Gilberto said
we can keep all of it.

08:22.545 --> 08:28.676
What? I thought we were going home.
We don't know anything about cocaine.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.762
We'll learn.

08:31.846 --> 08:34.307
If they can, why not us?

08:35.433 --> 08:37.268
And what about Judy?

08:40.021 --> 08:43.482
Judy feels Medellín
is only big enough for one narco.

08:44.317 --> 08:47.778
We'll let the Castaños decide which one.

09:54.971 --> 09:56.514
- Fabian.
- Yes?

09:56.597 --> 09:59.475
- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.102
Hurry up, Berna.

10:02.645 --> 10:06.232
Relax, Judy.
That meeting can't start without you.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.236
How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

10:10.319 --> 10:14.365
- Forty-five in each one.
- How many supervisors?

10:14.448 --> 10:16.117
Three in each.

10:17.034 --> 10:20.288
- We need twice as many shifts.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:20.955 --> 10:23.916
Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.
The boss is leaving.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.042
Yes, sir.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.365
- Peña.
<i>- Javier.</i>

10:57.950 --> 11:00.536
- What do you want?
- Something happened, we need to talk.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.121
I'm busy. I can't talk.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.290
<i>There's been an attempt on Judy.</i>

11:05.791 --> 11:09.503
She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.135
Give me time.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.376
- Peña.
- Mr. Peña has arrived.

11:49.502 --> 11:52.004
Let's go. Search.

12:20.408 --> 12:25.121
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

12:25.204 --> 12:29.917
What are the Castaños thinking?
That they can chase me out?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.752
I'm not leaving.

12:31.836 --> 12:33.921
They don't want you to leave,
they want to kill you.

12:34.880 --> 12:40.010
And what about you?
You're in this with me too.

12:45.558 --> 12:51.564
Look... you brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.774
This is all your doing.

12:53.858 --> 12:56.735
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.696
Don't call me again.

13:00.281 --> 13:04.326
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

13:04.410 --> 13:07.621
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

13:07.705 --> 13:09.206
that's killed innocent people.

13:09.290 --> 13:14.378
I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.174
Are you threatening me?

13:18.257 --> 13:21.385
Yes, I'm threatening you.

13:28.476 --> 13:30.060
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

13:32.188 --> 13:33.439
What do you want?

13:33.522 --> 13:35.232
You're a cop.

13:36.484 --> 13:39.403
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

13:39.487 --> 13:42.198
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes'.

13:43.115 --> 13:44.492
Arrest them.

13:45.326 --> 13:48.370
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

13:49.246 --> 13:53.250
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no? Then how?

14:03.886 --> 14:05.638
We'll do it my way.

14:06.805 --> 14:10.601
So you want Judy to be a rat?

14:10.684 --> 14:12.353
I don't agree with this, Javier.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.856
We are narcos, but we have our honor.

14:16.565 --> 14:21.862
Berna... you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

14:23.364 --> 14:25.241
Fuck your honor.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.161
Says you.

14:29.245 --> 14:32.873
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.001
And what have you done?

14:38.128 --> 14:40.756
If you have a better idea, go for it.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.385
Otherwise, this is the deal.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.887
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

14:47.513 --> 14:50.307
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

14:51.267 --> 14:56.272
If you don't like it,
you can take on the Castaños alone.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.819
We haven't heard anything from him
for weeks.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.448
We don't even know where he is.

15:47.531 --> 15:50.159
I don't know why you're letting
De Greiff come here.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.119
He's coming to scare you.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.247
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.500
You don't understand, do you?

16:01.587 --> 16:03.922
We don't have any more money, Hermilda.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.884
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.512
Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

16:10.596 --> 16:13.015
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

16:13.098 --> 16:15.225
They're going to give us their money?

16:20.564 --> 16:22.316
No one is going to help us.

16:23.484 --> 16:25.653
Everyone knows what that would mean.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.125
Whatever he's doing...

16:41.335 --> 16:45.756
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.509
Don't forget that.

17:13.659 --> 17:20.374
Pablo? Can you hear me, Pablo?
Please answer.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.432
Tata, can you hear me?

17:40.561 --> 17:41.687
Tata?

17:44.148 --> 17:45.649
Can you hear me?

19:01.308 --> 19:04.686
That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

19:04.770 --> 19:09.525
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.819
Our donation to them is an advance.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.489
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

19:15.572 --> 19:19.284
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.328
What a fucking joke,

19:21.411 --> 19:24.665
the CIA and their war
against the communists.

19:24.748 --> 19:29.545
It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

19:31.255 --> 19:33.715
What? Any news about Judy?

19:33.799 --> 19:38.637
The Castaños took their first shot,
a bomb. But they didn't kill her.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.182
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

19:42.266 --> 19:46.478
What about her assistant?
The fat one, what do they call him? Berna?

19:46.562 --> 19:49.565
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

19:49.648 --> 19:53.068
Don Berna. Him we found.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.028
Where?

19:55.654 --> 19:56.947
Here.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.324
Out front.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.003
Don Berna!

20:13.755 --> 20:15.424
Welcome to Cali.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.260
Gilbert, thank you, brother.

20:18.343 --> 20:21.179
Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.

20:22.681 --> 20:26.143
Don't worry about it.
I'm here to speak to you all.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.228
Very well, brother.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.522
It's about Judy.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.637
Thanks. You won't regret it.

21:54.231 --> 21:56.733
Tata, are you there? Can you hear me?

22:22.676 --> 22:23.844
Tata, are you there?

22:29.099 --> 22:33.603
There's no signal here.
I don't know why you keep trying.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.983
Why don't you come drink with us?

22:38.900 --> 22:40.360
I'll be right there.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.423
There's coffee in the Thermos.

24:06.279 --> 24:09.241
He's communicating to his wife via radio.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.227
What do you want, Lugo? Money? Visa?

24:38.478 --> 24:41.940
No visa, no money, you understand?

24:44.234 --> 24:48.530
Is that what he thinks? That everyone
wants to go to the United States?

24:49.573 --> 24:51.575
I don't want anything.

24:51.658 --> 24:56.329
All I want is for this to end soon and you
to understand the family is in pain.

24:56.413 --> 24:58.790
Find him and kill him.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.623
What are you doing, Pablo?

27:47.083 --> 27:49.586
You don't know how to tie a knot.

27:58.511 --> 28:02.057
This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

28:35.298 --> 28:40.595
<i>Wanted. Pablo Escobar.
Reward: 2,700,000,000 pesos.</i>

28:40.678 --> 28:45.100
<i>Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-600.</i>

28:45.183 --> 28:51.189
<i>In Bogotá, 22-50-12.
In Medellín 61-11-11.</i>

29:50.457 --> 29:53.460
The kids would love to be here.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.924
I've been thinking...

30:03.928 --> 30:06.764
I could buy some land here next to you.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.897
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.319
And have my own farm.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.542
We could run it together.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.760
What do you think?

31:00.151 --> 31:02.278
We need to finish putting up the wire.

31:16.501 --> 31:20.213
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

31:21.464 --> 31:26.219
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

31:27.595 --> 31:32.100
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

31:34.269 --> 31:39.899
In the face of all that
violence and death, you were strong.

31:39.983 --> 31:42.610
You are a survivor.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.280
A man of action.

31:45.363 --> 31:50.618
<i>I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.</i>

31:52.370 --> 31:54.330
- Good evening.
- Colonel.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.457
Sit.

31:58.167 --> 32:01.921
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

32:02.005 --> 32:04.716
Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.

32:04.799 --> 32:07.039
The codes are the same ones
that Escobar's wife is using.

32:07.093 --> 32:11.180
- He'll use them when he calls her.
- Did you confirm it's Escobar?

32:11.264 --> 32:12.264
Did you hear him?

32:13.933 --> 32:15.059
No, Colonel, not yet.

33:01.314 --> 33:06.235
Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

33:07.278 --> 33:09.447
I wasn't paying that much attention.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.742
But you're paying attention to me now,
right?

33:18.289 --> 33:19.499
So, what do you think?

33:21.042 --> 33:24.003
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

33:25.713 --> 33:29.842
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

33:36.891 --> 33:39.143
Now hold on to the pig.

33:45.692 --> 33:48.236
Funny that you don't like blood.

33:49.404 --> 33:51.489
How strange.

33:52.448 --> 33:54.325
What are you trying to say?

33:59.747 --> 34:01.416
Clean yourself.

34:10.383 --> 34:12.677
You know what's funny?

34:18.516 --> 34:20.309
That my dad...

34:22.228 --> 34:27.442
has no fucking idea who I am.

34:29.694 --> 34:32.155
I know very well who you are.

34:34.657 --> 34:39.287
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

34:39.370 --> 34:40.538
Is that right?

34:40.621 --> 34:43.791
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

34:43.875 --> 34:46.461
The United States? Disgusting.

34:47.211 --> 34:52.258
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

34:52.341 --> 34:56.804
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

34:57.972 --> 35:01.017
- So what? So what?
- So what?!

35:01.100 --> 35:04.896
And what about you? What about you?!

35:08.566 --> 35:13.237
Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.

35:13.321 --> 35:16.115
On this shithole farm.

35:17.909 --> 35:20.870
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

35:22.121 --> 35:25.041
Not even one fucking picture of them here.

35:29.629 --> 35:32.381
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

35:34.717 --> 35:35.968
That's right.

35:39.889 --> 35:41.808
Now tell me...

35:44.185 --> 35:45.770
Tell me...

35:47.772 --> 35:50.233
what you think of me.

35:54.821 --> 35:57.532
- Who cares?
- I do.

35:59.075 --> 36:01.118
It's important to me.

36:04.080 --> 36:08.167
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

36:09.752 --> 36:12.463
But that's not possible, Pablo.

36:13.923 --> 36:16.384
You chose your life!

36:17.218 --> 36:18.845
Be in charge of it.

36:20.304 --> 36:23.224
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

36:25.268 --> 36:27.228
I'm ashamed.

36:30.815 --> 36:33.860
I think you're a murderer.

36:38.906 --> 36:40.950
At last, the truth.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.707
At last, the truth.

36:49.417 --> 36:50.918
A truth...

36:54.839 --> 36:57.049
that breaks my heart.

37:02.179 --> 37:03.890
Leave me alone.

37:39.383 --> 37:40.801
Limón.

37:43.512 --> 37:44.847
Yes, sir?

37:49.852 --> 37:52.063
You like it here, right?

37:53.731 --> 37:55.733
Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.861
Peaceful.

38:03.366 --> 38:04.825
Kneel down.

38:16.671 --> 38:22.677
A few kilometers from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

38:23.719 --> 38:27.640
Under that tree is a buried case of money.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.018
Go get it.

38:31.102 --> 38:32.353
Are we leaving, boss?

38:33.562 --> 38:34.730
Yes.

38:36.899 --> 38:37.899
Go on.

38:55.209 --> 38:57.962
<i>That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.</i>

38:58.045 --> 39:02.550
<i>How long did you think this arrangement
was going to last?</i>

39:02.633 --> 39:05.886
Do you not realize that if we leave here,
they're going to kill us?

39:05.970 --> 39:12.727
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

39:12.810 --> 39:16.272
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

39:16.355 --> 39:20.776
That is not our problem.
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.153
You're sorry?

39:22.987 --> 39:25.656
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

39:25.740 --> 39:29.702
I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But--

39:29.785 --> 39:31.746
But you can't help us find asylum.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.545
That's bullshit!

39:40.671 --> 39:44.383
They're going to... kill us all.

39:45.342 --> 39:47.470
Mama, what's wrong?

39:51.557 --> 39:52.975
Nothing, my love.

40:05.112 --> 40:07.073
I'm sorry, Attorney General...

40:09.700 --> 40:11.869
but I don't know what else to do.

40:17.666 --> 40:23.047
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.049
Tell him to surrender.

40:25.966 --> 40:30.638
The power of the law is your last hope.

40:31.847 --> 40:33.808
Think about your children.

41:20.479 --> 41:21.939
Shit.

42:39.308 --> 42:43.729
Yes, before you go to sleep.
Do you like it? Yes?

43:18.305 --> 43:19.640
Fuck.

43:20.641 --> 43:23.727
Jhon. What are you doing here?

43:29.233 --> 43:34.822
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

43:34.905 --> 43:37.533
We spent it. It's gone.

43:37.616 --> 43:40.452
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

43:44.498 --> 43:46.292
You've already hurt me.

43:47.626 --> 43:49.420
You fucked up my life.

43:57.219 --> 44:00.597
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

44:02.266 --> 44:03.600
Hang on, Maritza.

44:21.368 --> 44:22.494
And this?

44:26.790 --> 44:30.627
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

44:30.711 --> 44:34.965
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

44:35.049 --> 44:38.719
You lying... bitch! Get off!

44:38.802 --> 44:41.597
Motherfucker! Bastard!

44:41.680 --> 44:45.434
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

44:45.517 --> 44:48.604
Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.

44:51.148 --> 44:52.483
What did you say?

44:54.693 --> 44:57.196
Are you going to say something?
Are you going to rat on me?

44:57.279 --> 45:00.699
I might! Why shouldn't I?

45:02.451 --> 45:06.497
What? So now you're a killer?
Like your hero?

45:08.415 --> 45:09.917
Jhon!

45:10.876 --> 45:13.337
I know you! Get that shit out--

46:09.393 --> 46:12.104
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

46:13.021 --> 46:15.190
But I have bad news.

46:15.274 --> 46:17.317
- What happened?
- Look.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.578
It's rotten, sir.

46:38.464 --> 46:42.593
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

46:51.643 --> 46:54.730
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

46:54.813 --> 46:57.316
There's about six thousand dollars
I counted, boss.

47:07.784 --> 47:10.913
Get your things. We're leaving.

47:13.123 --> 47:15.626
<i>Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.</i>

47:15.709 --> 47:20.005
<i>Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.</i>

47:20.088 --> 47:21.088
Where?

47:21.131 --> 47:23.217
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

47:24.176 --> 47:25.177
We've used it before.

47:26.261 --> 47:27.888
<i>Berna knows where.</i>

47:28.555 --> 47:30.098
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

47:48.450 --> 47:50.911
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

47:52.371 --> 47:53.747
Let's go, Flaco.

48:09.096 --> 48:11.557
I know what you're thinking.

48:14.393 --> 48:16.520
I'm making a mistake.

48:18.897 --> 48:22.818
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

48:22.901 --> 48:26.363
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

48:26.446 --> 48:27.614
Up here, Flaco.

48:41.878 --> 48:44.381
I can't protect a rat.

49:01.898 --> 49:05.027
I didn't think you'd betray me.

49:06.236 --> 49:08.614
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

49:09.740 --> 49:12.284
So now, you're going to get on that plane.

49:12.367 --> 49:15.287
And if I don't, what? What happens?

49:15.370 --> 49:18.332
If you don't get in,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

49:18.415 --> 49:20.459
And I won't protect you anymore.

49:51.823 --> 49:53.241
Tell me something.

49:54.576 --> 49:56.578
Did Cali arrange this?

49:59.039 --> 50:01.583
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

50:01.667 --> 50:05.712
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

50:07.005 --> 50:11.218
They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

50:11.301 --> 50:15.055
- So you fucked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

50:15.764 --> 50:17.849
I only protected your life.

50:19.309 --> 50:23.897
Relax. You'll have money.

50:23.980 --> 50:27.234
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

50:28.110 --> 50:30.987
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

50:32.364 --> 50:36.535
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

50:43.125 --> 50:44.835
Don't worry about a thing.

50:45.544 --> 50:51.216
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

54:45.325 --> 54:46.618
Tata?

54:51.706 --> 54:53.416
Tata, can you hear me?

54:54.209 --> 54:55.543
<i>Pablo?</i>

54:58.296 --> 54:59.965
It's me, my love.

55:00.924 --> 55:03.051
<i>Finally, I can speak to you, my love.</i>

55:03.677 --> 55:05.303
<i>I've missed you so much.</i>

55:06.012 --> 55:08.014
<i>Where have you been, Pablo?</i>

55:11.351 --> 55:14.104
I had to do something very important.

55:18.108 --> 55:20.527
But I'm back home, my love.

55:23.655 --> 55:25.657
I'm home.
