02:39.225 --> 02:41.126
So I'm supposed to be impressed 
he was kept back?               

02:41.127 --> 02:44.095
You leaving?                    

02:44.096 --> 02:47.331
What are you developing         
in the back?                    

02:47.332 --> 02:48.967
                        Nothing.

02:48.968 --> 02:50.401
                Probably        
          some nudie pictures.  

02:53.172 --> 02:54.172
 <i>What? He's cute.</i>               

02:55.174 --> 02:57.441
         <i>You always say that.</i>   

02:57.442 --> 02:58.442
 <i>Well, why</i>                      
 <i>don't you then?</i>                

02:58.443 --> 02:59.978
        Um, Mr. Sneider?        

03:01.046 --> 03:02.747
    Good night, Simon.          

03:04.917 --> 03:05.850
                 <i>I always laugh.</i>

03:09.288 --> 03:10.221
              Yes?              

03:12.057 --> 03:16.127
        You said--              
    earlier, you said, um...    

03:17.196 --> 03:20.031
Oh, right, right.               

03:20.032 --> 03:22.066
Right.                          

03:22.067 --> 03:23.067
Here you go.                    

03:23.068 --> 03:25.003
Take care of it.                

07:00.853 --> 07:02.620
Hello, mama.                    

07:02.621 --> 07:05.322
                    You're late.

07:05.323 --> 07:06.490
                 Where were you?

07:09.828 --> 07:12.296
                 I thought maybe
            you met a friend.   

07:14.133 --> 07:15.499
                     Do you have
                a new friend?   

07:17.335 --> 07:19.036
                       <i>That girl</i>
             <i>from down the hall?</i>

07:19.037 --> 07:20.972
              No.               

07:27.312 --> 07:28.780
How was your day?               

07:28.781 --> 07:31.082
    Mr. Lawson expects          
      everything he wants       

07:31.083 --> 07:32.183
        In five seconds.        

07:32.184 --> 07:33.785
If I get one thing wrong,       
        he yells--              

09:20.826 --> 09:21.759
          To the left.          

09:23.662 --> 09:26.097
   <i>Good. Thank you very much,</i>   
          <i>Mr. Pensara.</i>          

09:28.867 --> 09:30.601
                        You have
        macular degeneration.   

09:30.602 --> 09:32.670
         <i>The part of your eye</i>   
         <i>that processes light</i>   

09:32.671 --> 09:33.671
                 <i>Is diseased.</i>   

09:33.672 --> 09:34.638
        Can you fix it?         

09:36.075 --> 09:37.274
                        I'm sure
            you're going to want

09:37.275 --> 09:38.609
            To talk this over   
            with your family.   

09:40.312 --> 09:41.312
         <i>I'm gonna prescribe you</i>

09:41.313 --> 09:42.313
                    These drops.

09:42.314 --> 09:43.480
                You take them   
                two times a day,

09:43.481 --> 09:44.816
            Once when you get up
                  in the morning

09:44.817 --> 09:46.283
                 And once before
         you go to bed at night.

09:46.284 --> 09:47.418
          <i>They've been effective</i>

09:47.419 --> 09:48.720
                      <i>In slowing</i>
           <i>the course of disease</i>

09:48.721 --> 09:49.687
               <i>In some patients.</i>

09:54.026 --> 09:55.292
How long do I have?             

09:57.029 --> 09:58.096
                A few months.   

10:00.432 --> 10:01.999
       <i>Oh, it's very progressed,</i>
                 <i>Mr. Pensara.</i>   

10:02.000 --> 10:05.036
                      <i>I'm sorry,</i>
         <i>but you're going blind.</i>

10:12.778 --> 10:14.746
Tommaso,                        
how are you?                    

10:16.681 --> 10:18.182
Good morning,                   
Tommaso.                        

10:35.834 --> 10:36.934
                   <i>Buenos dias,</i> 
                         Tommas.

10:38.436 --> 10:40.738
                 <i>Notice anything</i>
             <i>different about me?</i>

10:46.444 --> 10:47.745
                    My bangs.   

10:47.746 --> 10:48.813
                     <i>My daughter</i>

10:48.814 --> 10:50.748
Oh, yes, I see.                 

10:50.749 --> 10:51.749
Very nice.                      

10:51.750 --> 10:52.750
                        Gracias.

10:52.751 --> 10:54.618
                        Ooh. Oh.

10:54.619 --> 10:55.953
                    This is--   
              this isn't for me.

10:55.954 --> 10:56.888
                It's for Vargas.

10:59.925 --> 11:00.992
        I'm sorry.              

13:32.411 --> 13:33.411
             Hello, Mr. Pensara.

13:33.412 --> 13:34.445
                    I'm sorry   
                you had to wait.

13:34.446 --> 13:36.213
I'll be late                    
getting back to work.           

13:36.214 --> 13:38.316
        Well, you didn't have   
                 an appointment.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.251
    Am I really going blind?    

13:44.056 --> 13:45.622
        What do you do,         
          Mr. Pensara?          

13:45.623 --> 13:47.258
I'm a painter.                  

13:49.094 --> 13:50.328
    What do you paint?          

13:50.329 --> 13:51.762
People, mostly.                 

13:53.031 --> 13:54.598
    Well, did you talk          
        to your family?         

13:56.969 --> 13:58.369
    I don't have one.           

13:58.370 --> 14:00.037
            Do you have friends?

14:00.038 --> 14:01.038
Of course.                      

14:01.039 --> 14:02.440
Do I look like                  
a pariah?                       

14:02.441 --> 14:04.075
I think you're gonna need       
        to talk to them         

14:04.076 --> 14:05.309
     And ask for their help     
        right now.              

14:09.281 --> 14:10.314
                            Yes.
How old is he?                  

14:11.383 --> 14:13.717
        In that picture,        
        he's 20 months.         

14:15.787 --> 14:19.690
 Well, I have patients waiting, 
 so I have to get back to work. 

16:58.383 --> 17:00.184
             Yahoo!             

17:01.686 --> 17:02.752
             Uh-oh.             

17:39.991 --> 17:41.558
                            Hey.
Hey.                            

17:41.559 --> 17:42.559
                  How you doing?

17:42.560 --> 17:43.593
Fine.                           

17:43.594 --> 17:44.594
What do you want?               

17:44.595 --> 17:46.563
    I needed your signature     
        on some papers.         

17:46.564 --> 17:47.864
That's a waste of time.         

17:47.865 --> 17:50.167
        I told the bank         
    I'd have them back          

17:50.168 --> 17:51.268
  First thing in the morning.   

17:51.269 --> 17:52.936
To refinance a place            
we're not gonna keep?           

17:52.937 --> 17:54.704
                So if he's rich,
     you might change your mind.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.241
             Rose.              

17:57.242 --> 17:59.109

17:59.110 --> 18:00.744
      I'll drop it, okay?       

18:01.846 --> 18:02.913
                    Hi, Rose.   

18:05.483 --> 18:07.151

18:20.031 --> 18:21.231
 So what are you doing tonight? 

18:21.232 --> 18:23.400
 I have to finish some reading.

18:29.207 --> 18:30.207

                  Yvette, you're
        a pretty little girl,   

21:34.325 --> 21:36.226

23:43.788 --> 23:46.323
    If business doesn't pick up,
                we're cooked.   

23:48.226 --> 23:51.228
            The guy who invented
             the digital camera,

23:51.229 --> 23:52.262
        The number one reason   

23:52.263 --> 23:54.364
                    To repeal   
         the assault weapon ban.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.167
Mr. Sneider.                    

23:57.168 --> 23:58.902
              You like that, eh?

24:00.805 --> 24:02.973
                     Hey, Simon,
         you finish your prints?

24:02.974 --> 24:06.443
                      Yeah, and?

24:06.444 --> 24:08.745
                     Yeah, well,
    at least you got a hobby.   

24:08.746 --> 24:10.180
        And hobbies are good.   

24:10.181 --> 24:12.916
                They keep you   
                from going crazy

24:12.917 --> 24:13.917
                        Like me.

24:19.357 --> 24:22.859
             You're a funny kid,
                          Simon.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.328
             You don't say much,
                         do you?

24:56.927 --> 25:01.465
Come on, Simon,                 
let's play.                     

25:13.844 --> 25:14.944
You lost some weight.           

25:16.147 --> 25:17.147
                    For real?   

25:17.148 --> 25:20.083
Mm-hmm.                         

25:20.084 --> 25:22.052
You got to eat,                 

25:22.053 --> 25:23.920
Or you're gonna                 
disappear                       

25:23.921 --> 25:25.255
Like Houdini.                   

25:28.592 --> 25:30.360
              You're crazy, mom.

25:33.697 --> 25:37.200
Oh.                             

25:37.201 --> 25:38.201
                         Ma, ma.

25:38.202 --> 25:39.836
Oh, come on.                    
It's terrible.                  

25:39.837 --> 25:41.271
It's like                       
a third eye.                    

26:00.425 --> 26:01.458
Who is she?                     

26:04.228 --> 26:05.228
    Let me get those.           

26:05.229 --> 26:08.298
No, I want to know              
who she is.                     

26:13.271 --> 26:15.772
Are you stalking her?           

26:20.711 --> 26:24.181
Well, that's perverted.         

26:26.284 --> 26:28.418
Why do you want                 
to take pictures                

26:28.419 --> 26:31.121
Of girls                        
you don't know?                 

26:31.122 --> 26:34.657
Instead of taking pictures      
of women,                       

26:34.658 --> 26:38.128
Why don't you try               
talking to one?                 

27:22.673 --> 27:25.308
    Since feeling is first,     

27:25.309 --> 27:28.077
     Who pays any attention     
    to the syntax of things     

27:28.078 --> 27:30.480
  Will never wholly kiss you.   

27:30.481 --> 27:32.482
    Kisses are a better fate    

27:32.483 --> 27:34.017
          <i>Than wisdom.</i>          

27:34.018 --> 27:36.419
  <i>The best gesture of my brain</i>  

27:36.420 --> 27:39.456
          <i>Is less than</i>          
     <i>your eyelids' flutter.</i>     

27:39.457 --> 27:40.457
               <i>Hm.</i>              

27:40.458 --> 27:41.858
 <i>Life is not a paragraph,</i>       

27:41.859 --> 27:43.493
       <i>And death, I think,</i>      

27:43.494 --> 27:46.429
    Is no parentheses.          

27:46.430 --> 27:49.799
  So, what do we make of this?  

27:49.800 --> 27:50.800
             Becca.             

27:50.801 --> 27:53.102
    I love it when he says,     

27:53.103 --> 27:54.471
 "the best gesture of my brain  

27:54.472 --> 27:56.439
          Is less than          
    your eyelids' flutter."     

27:56.440 --> 27:58.241
             Why?               
         <i>He's kind of saying</i>    

27:58.242 --> 27:59.342
    We can miss out on life     

27:59.343 --> 28:01.378
  If we intellectualize stuff   
        too much.               

28:01.379 --> 28:03.079
    Exactly, exactly.           

28:03.080 --> 28:04.914
    He also goes on to say,     

28:04.915 --> 28:08.518
"kisses are a better fate       
         than wisdom."          

28:08.519 --> 28:09.519
        Right on.               

28:12.690 --> 28:15.992
        Okay, how about         
the last line at the end,       

28:15.993 --> 28:18.795
      "and death, I think,      
      is no parentheses."       

28:22.333 --> 28:24.801
  <i>Well, what is a parentheses?</i>  

28:24.802 --> 28:27.770
    Sort of like a time-out.    

28:27.771 --> 28:29.573
     Okay, so what Cummings     
         is saying here         

28:29.574 --> 28:32.742
    Is that he's using          
 the parentheses as a metaphor  

28:32.743 --> 28:39.849
To say that death actually      
    is not a time-out,          

28:39.850 --> 28:47.490
          That it's--           
      it's the end, final.      

29:59.430 --> 30:00.963
          Okay, okay.           

30:27.891 --> 30:30.493
Yes, I want to report a...      

30:30.494 --> 30:31.527
              <i>Yes?</i>              

30:31.528 --> 30:33.496
     I received some photos     
          in the mail.          

30:33.497 --> 30:34.563
   <i>What kind of photos, ma'am?</i>  

30:34.564 --> 30:35.665
          Of me mostly          
        and my husband.         

30:35.666 --> 30:36.866
    I don't know what it is.    

30:36.867 --> 30:38.067
      I don't really know       
          what it is.           

30:38.068 --> 30:39.068
  Someone's been following me.  

30:39.069 --> 30:40.069
     <i>What's your name?</i>          

30:40.070 --> 30:41.303
    Rose, Rose Phipps.          

30:41.304 --> 30:42.705
      <i>What's your address,</i>      
          <i>Mrs. Phipps?</i>          

30:42.706 --> 30:45.808
     251 west 83rd street,      
 between Broadway and West End. 

30:45.809 --> 30:47.076
       <i>All right, hang on.</i>      

30:47.077 --> 30:48.945
     <i>I'm gonna transfer you</i>     
     <i>to officer Banda.</i>          

32:22.806 --> 32:25.374
These were delivered            
to me yesterday.                

32:25.375 --> 32:26.776
They have your address          
on the back.                    

32:26.777 --> 32:28.277
I wonder if you know            
who took them.                  

32:30.247 --> 32:33.816
                    Excuse me   
                for a minute.   

32:33.817 --> 32:37.486
            Mr. Sneider, I think
         you better handle this.

32:41.091 --> 32:42.524
            He'll be with you   
                    in a minute.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.630
Hi.                             
              Hi.               

32:59.743 --> 33:01.343
                          Simon.

33:01.344 --> 33:03.646
Simon, could you come out       
     in the front, please?      

33:11.021 --> 33:12.822
                    This woman--

33:12.823 --> 33:14.757
                      I'm sorry.
          I didn't get the name.

33:14.758 --> 33:15.758
          Rose Phipps.          

33:15.759 --> 33:16.859
                    Miss Phipps.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.661
                Miss Phipps says
        she got these photos.   

33:18.662 --> 33:20.562
 <i>She received them</i>              
 <i>yesterday.</i>                     

33:20.563 --> 33:22.231
 <i>You know anything</i>              
 <i>about them?</i>                    

33:22.232 --> 33:23.166
              No.               

33:25.269 --> 33:27.703
 <i>We get a lot of orders here,</i>   
                 <i>Miss Phipps.</i>   

33:27.704 --> 33:29.105
 <i>I can't remember</i>               
 <i>every one of them.</i>             

33:29.106 --> 33:30.773
             <i>Can you look it up?</i>

33:30.774 --> 33:34.376
 <i>Uh, no, not without</i>            
 <i>the order number.</i>              

33:34.377 --> 33:35.377
                      I'm sorry.

33:35.378 --> 33:36.779
    Who would do this?          

33:36.780 --> 33:38.948
                Well, forgive   
                 my forwardness,

33:38.949 --> 33:40.783
                 <i>Miss Phipps,</i>   
                     <i>but you are</i>

33:40.784 --> 33:42.051
         <i>An extremely attractive</i>
                          <i>woman.</i>

33:46.690 --> 33:48.390
         <i>Look, they were</i>        
 <i>obviously developed here.</i>      

33:48.391 --> 33:51.861
          <i>Are you sure</i>          
  <i>you don't remember anything?</i>  

33:53.763 --> 33:56.199
                        No, I...

33:56.200 --> 33:57.300
        No, nothing's coming.   

33:57.301 --> 33:58.500
            Melanie?            

33:58.501 --> 34:00.002
             <i>Do you?</i>            

34:04.942 --> 34:06.275
          Well, maybe           
      it's your boyfriend.      

34:07.510 --> 34:09.011
  How can he take the picture   
         if he's in it?         

34:18.021 --> 34:20.422
        Excuse me.              

34:29.900 --> 34:30.900
                    Miss Phipps,

34:30.900 --> 34:32.034
    Can I talk to you           
         for a moment?          

34:35.239 --> 34:38.674
            Listen, miss Phipps,

34:38.675 --> 34:40.609
             I really don't want
    to have a problem over this.

34:40.610 --> 34:44.146
 <i>Isn't there some way that</i>      
  <i>we can resolve this situation</i> 

34:44.147 --> 34:46.181
     <i>So that everybody</i>          
     <i>goes home happy?</i>           

34:50.187 --> 34:52.721
That's not necessary.           

35:06.370 --> 35:09.838
                Simon, would you
        come with me, please?   

35:19.349 --> 35:21.717
          I don't know what game
  you think you're playing, son,

35:21.718 --> 35:24.153
         But it stops right now.

35:24.154 --> 35:26.889
        I got enough problems   
    with my business already.   

36:18.842 --> 36:20.542
                            Hey.

36:20.543 --> 36:21.978
                    I don't want
        to make trouble for you,

36:21.979 --> 36:24.213
              But I want to know
          who took these photos.

36:30.087 --> 36:32.888
It was a cold day.              

36:32.889 --> 36:34.156
                  You took them?

36:35.993 --> 36:37.693
                You followed me?

36:37.694 --> 36:38.627
                           <i>Wait.</i>

36:39.863 --> 36:40.796
Why?                            

36:49.206 --> 36:51.207
              I liked the scarf.

37:22.939 --> 37:24.006
No, no, not really,             

37:24.007 --> 37:27.343
Because he could hear           
the music in his head,          

37:27.344 --> 37:30.012
The rich, beautiful             
melodies,                       

37:30.013 --> 37:33.682
Each instrument,                

37:33.683 --> 37:36.519
The other strings, the wind,    
the percussion.                 

37:36.520 --> 37:38.387
It's--it's like                 
they were playing it            

37:38.388 --> 37:41.490
Right in front                  
of him.                         

37:41.491 --> 37:44.493
No, what is sad is not          
a composer going deaf, no.      

37:44.494 --> 37:50.266
What is sad is                  
a painter going blind.          

37:57.541 --> 38:02.744
You know, before today,         

38:02.745 --> 38:05.013
I had never been inside         
Lincoln center.                 

38:05.014 --> 38:06.048
                          Never?

38:06.049 --> 38:07.483
Paul and I                      
always listened to music,       

38:07.484 --> 38:08.517
But we didn't                   
go out much.                    

38:08.518 --> 38:10.586
Paul didn't want                
to spend the money,             

38:10.587 --> 38:12.054
And with our girls,             
it was always,                  

38:12.055 --> 38:13.155
You know,                       
save, save, save.               

38:13.156 --> 38:16.024
            I never had children
        so everything I saved   

38:16.025 --> 38:17.025
                     Was for me.

38:17.026 --> 38:19.228
Oh.                             

38:19.229 --> 38:21.630
Have you                        
ever been married?              

38:21.631 --> 38:22.565
                             No.

38:27.571 --> 38:31.940
Tommas, you're                  
a very cultured man.            

38:33.143 --> 38:35.244
Why do you work                 
in a mail room?                 

38:35.245 --> 38:37.012
            Where should I work?

38:37.013 --> 38:39.047
I don't know.                   

38:39.048 --> 38:40.616
It just seems                   
like an odd job                 

38:40.617 --> 38:41.617
For somebody like you.          

38:41.618 --> 38:42.618
                 Well, I've been

38:42.619 --> 38:44.487
                 With the agency
                for 15 years.   

38:44.488 --> 38:45.554
            I make enough money.

38:45.555 --> 38:47.490
             I report to no one.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.657
          People leave me alone.

38:48.658 --> 38:50.626
      What else do I need?      

39:50.787 --> 39:52.888
  <i>Do you see what's happening?</i>  

39:54.957 --> 39:56.392
                    Did you know
        that in his later years,

39:56.393 --> 39:57.560
              Goya became blind?

39:57.561 --> 39:58.994
                He used to touch
             his subjects' faces

39:58.995 --> 39:59.995
             With one hand and--

39:59.996 --> 40:01.597
Have you seen                   
those paintings?                

40:01.598 --> 40:03.599
They're grotesque.              

40:03.600 --> 40:05.767
    Well, Monet had cataracts   
when he did <i>the water lilies.</i>   

40:05.768 --> 40:06.768
         We studied him during--

40:06.769 --> 40:08.770
I'm not Monet,                  
Dr. Phipps.                     

40:08.771 --> 40:10.606
    It doesn't matter.          

40:10.607 --> 40:11.807
      No, it does matter.       

40:12.909 --> 40:14.410
  Do you think future students  

40:14.411 --> 40:17.813
Will care about                 
why my work changed?            

40:17.814 --> 40:19.815
    No one will study           
  Tommaso Pensara, believe me.  

40:19.816 --> 40:21.217
              Well, many artists
                  are discovered

40:21.218 --> 40:22.218
             After their deaths.

40:22.219 --> 40:24.253
Well, I'm almost there.         

40:24.254 --> 40:25.754
                 <i>Don't say that.</i>

40:25.755 --> 40:27.122
Without my eyes,                

40:27.123 --> 40:28.591
My life is                      
completely meaningless.         

40:28.592 --> 40:29.525
                    It's not.   

40:31.828 --> 40:33.262
Do you know                     
what it's like to lose          

40:33.263 --> 40:34.830
The one thing                   
that gives your life meaning?   

40:34.831 --> 40:36.131
Have you any idea?              

40:36.132 --> 40:38.166
Do you know what it's like      
      to wake up each day       

40:38.167 --> 40:40.636
       <i>With the knowledge</i>       
 <i>that your life has no meaning?</i> 

40:40.637 --> 40:41.837
         I lost my son.         

40:48.010 --> 40:52.648
         I lost my son          
    eight months ago.           

40:52.649 --> 40:53.749
    He was almost two.          

40:59.489 --> 41:00.422
        I'm sorry.              

41:06.095 --> 41:07.929
          I was a boy           
      when my father died.      

41:09.733 --> 41:11.199
 <i>When my parents' friends</i>       
           <i>came over,</i>           

41:11.200 --> 41:12.968
 <i>They would take me aside,</i>      
       <i>and they would say,</i>      

41:12.969 --> 41:15.103
      <i>"Tommaso, don't cry.</i>      
           <i>Be strong."</i>          

41:17.574 --> 41:19.141
But you know when they say      
          "be strong,"          

41:19.142 --> 41:23.245
        They mean               
"I don't want to hear about it."

41:23.246 --> 41:26.248
     It's a lot of bullshit     
         if you ask me.         

41:42.565 --> 41:44.366
    Hello, my darling.          

41:44.367 --> 41:46.268
          <i>What a night.</i>         

41:56.379 --> 41:59.782
          Let's dance.          

41:59.783 --> 42:01.082
         <i>Sometimes</i>              

42:01.083 --> 42:03.819
I don't think you realize       
      how much I love you.      

42:06.723 --> 42:10.025
                     Ma, ma, ma.

42:10.026 --> 42:11.092
                    What's wrong
                    with you?   

42:11.093 --> 42:12.328
Let's dance.                    

42:16.165 --> 42:17.098
Mm.                             

42:25.141 --> 42:27.876
Come on.                        

42:27.877 --> 42:28.977
Dance with me.                  

42:31.581 --> 42:34.450
You love me,                    
don't you? Hm?                  

42:47.597 --> 42:48.797
             Mama.              

42:53.970 --> 42:55.904
Ma.                             

43:07.917 --> 43:12.421
      <i>...Se ha desarrollado</i>     
   <i>de Una manera fantastica...</i>  

44:03.072 --> 44:06.775
Hi, Simon.                      

44:06.776 --> 44:08.811
            You want            
         some of these?         

44:08.812 --> 44:10.712
            Come on,            
 they make you feel real good.  

44:12.248 --> 44:15.918
    Man, why you so serious     
         all the time?          

44:15.919 --> 44:17.820
        You ever kissed         
            a girl?             

44:17.821 --> 44:20.155
      'cause Melanie here,      
     she says she gets hot      

44:20.156 --> 44:22.658
Just fantasizing about you      
and shit.                       

44:22.659 --> 44:23.926
Shut up,                        
Ana.                            

44:23.927 --> 44:24.927
Man, this is                    
your Chance.                    

44:25.929 --> 44:27.128
 <i>I'll see you later.</i>            

44:32.068 --> 44:36.071
      Ooh, rock hard, man.      

44:36.072 --> 44:37.272
What is with you?               

48:03.279 --> 48:04.513
                Hey, Mr. Phipps.

48:04.514 --> 48:05.847
How are you, Karen?             

48:19.595 --> 48:20.529
             Mark.              

48:21.898 --> 48:22.898
              Hey.              

48:22.899 --> 48:24.066
         Um, I'll be--          

48:24.067 --> 48:25.967
      See you at the desk       
          in a minute.          

48:25.968 --> 48:26.902
     You should've called.      

48:28.138 --> 48:29.071
      This is incredible.       

48:32.742 --> 48:36.011
 Listen, my students are having 
a reading of their poetry,      

48:36.012 --> 48:37.612
      And I was wondering       
     if you'd like to come.     

48:37.613 --> 48:40.182
          When is it?           

48:40.183 --> 48:41.483
 <i>Next week.</i>                     

48:41.484 --> 48:42.951
     Is that what you came      
         to talk about?         

48:42.952 --> 48:45.554
Oh, no,                         
not only that.                  

48:45.555 --> 48:48.623
I wanted to apologize           
for what I said to you          

48:48.624 --> 48:50.092
The other night                 
after the movie.                

48:52.128 --> 48:53.362
                        I forgot
                  what you said.

48:54.897 --> 48:58.833
Rose, this is bullshit,         
okay?                           

48:58.834 --> 49:00.202
 <i>I know that</i>                    
 <i>the last few months</i>            

49:00.203 --> 49:02.104
Have been very tough            
for you, and I just wanted--    

49:02.105 --> 49:03.738
You act like it something       
  that's only happened to me.   

49:03.739 --> 49:06.208
I just want you to stop         
being so mad at me all the time.

49:06.209 --> 49:07.209
    Do you still cry?           

49:07.210 --> 49:08.243
Of course I do.                 

49:08.244 --> 49:10.245
         Because I cry          
      every fucking night.      

49:12.549 --> 49:13.615
          I know that.          

49:13.616 --> 49:16.051
        How do you know?        

49:17.287 --> 49:18.220
      Because I know you.       

49:19.522 --> 49:21.022
         You think so?          

49:22.392 --> 49:24.126
          If I don't,           
      nobody does, right?       

49:25.495 --> 49:26.462
         You're wrong.          

49:32.668 --> 49:33.768
          Another guy?          

49:33.769 --> 49:35.337
                        Yeah.   

49:40.410 --> 49:41.543
      When'd you meet him?      

49:41.544 --> 49:43.011
                  Just recently.

49:43.012 --> 49:44.846
Is it serious?                  

49:45.915 --> 49:46.948
                     Not really.

49:48.050 --> 49:49.084
    Have you slept with him?    

49:50.153 --> 49:51.853
              No.               

49:54.591 --> 49:55.591
        Do you plan to?         

49:59.596 --> 50:00.829
         I don't know.          

50:28.858 --> 50:30.592
Hey.                            

50:30.593 --> 50:31.593
                            Hey.

50:31.594 --> 50:33.128
You're home early.              

50:33.129 --> 50:34.829
Don't you got enough of me      
at night?                       

50:37.800 --> 50:39.768
                  Rose is seeing
                  somebody else.

50:42.938 --> 50:44.673
Oh, Mark,                       
I'm so sorry.                   

50:47.977 --> 50:49.044
                    I don't know
                     what to do.

50:50.713 --> 50:51.713
                 <i>She's making</i>   

50:51.714 --> 50:53.582
                  A big mistake.

50:53.583 --> 50:54.516
Maybe.                          

50:59.088 --> 51:00.289
                     What's that
            supposed to mean?   

51:00.290 --> 51:01.856
It's her life.                  

51:01.857 --> 51:02.857
                    You think   
                this is okay?   

51:02.858 --> 51:03.958
I don't know.                   

51:03.959 --> 51:06.528
She's the one                   
that's got to find out.         

51:06.529 --> 51:08.363
                  Find what out?

51:08.364 --> 51:10.599
You want me                     
to read your tarot?             

51:12.768 --> 51:14.002
                     No, Claire,
                I don't want you

51:14.003 --> 51:16.238
                To read my tarot
or break out your ouija board   

51:16.239 --> 51:17.939
                Or stick pins   
                     into a doll

51:17.940 --> 51:19.140
    Or whatever the hell else   
                        it is   

51:19.141 --> 51:20.409
         You friggin' people do.

51:20.410 --> 51:21.776
That's not necessary.           

51:21.777 --> 51:23.345
That's my next                  
appointment.                    

51:23.346 --> 51:24.713
You want to know                
the truth, Mark?                

51:24.714 --> 51:27.849
        And this is just        
sister to brother talking.      

51:27.850 --> 51:29.718
                You're really   
        judgmental sometimes.   

51:29.719 --> 51:31.086
Is that right?                  

51:31.087 --> 51:33.455
                 I'm just trying
                to be honest.   

51:33.456 --> 51:35.790
You take people's money         
to tell their future,           

51:35.791 --> 51:38.093
And you're gonna lecture me     
on honesty, huh?                

51:38.094 --> 51:39.094
Great.                          

51:39.095 --> 51:40.028
                        Mark.   

51:56.979 --> 51:58.647
    Hi, I've been receiving     

51:58.648 --> 52:00.882
Your catalogue every week.      

52:00.883 --> 52:03.619
  And I just really wish that   
you would stop sending it to me.

52:03.620 --> 52:04.986
   <i>What's the customer number?</i>  

52:04.987 --> 52:06.821
     <i>It's highlighted</i>           
     <i>in yellow on the back.</i>     

52:06.822 --> 52:10.158
             Kh789.             

52:10.159 --> 52:11.793
         <i>You've ordered</i>         
     <i>a few products from us.</i>    

52:11.794 --> 52:13.528
    I don't think so.           

52:13.529 --> 52:15.130
 <i>The musical cheshire cat?</i>      

52:16.299 --> 52:18.700
     <i>Big Ruby gorilla.</i>          

52:18.701 --> 52:19.701
     <i>The Mozart cube.</i>           

52:19.702 --> 52:22.604
  Stop. I know what I ordered.  

52:22.605 --> 52:25.507
      <i>Well, did your child</i>      
         <i>like the toys?</i>         

52:25.508 --> 52:26.541
      He liked them a lot.      

52:26.542 --> 52:29.444
        I just--I don't         
    need them anymore.          

52:30.880 --> 52:31.880
   <i>I'll take you off the list.</i>  

52:31.881 --> 52:32.814
        Thank you.              

53:36.512 --> 53:37.446
                        Shit.   

53:43.519 --> 53:44.853
What's going on?                

53:48.324 --> 53:49.624
                  Come on, Mark.

53:49.625 --> 53:51.727
              I'm really unhappy
                     about this.

53:51.728 --> 53:54.295
        You're bringing         
 a negative vibe into my space. 

53:54.296 --> 53:56.231
       <i>My wife's out there</i>      
     <i>fucking some other guy,</i>    

53:56.232 --> 53:57.899
 But we should try and maintain 

53:57.900 --> 53:59.501
       <i>The positive vibes?</i>      

53:59.502 --> 54:01.570
     <i>You know there's</i>           
         <i>a price to pay</i>         

54:01.571 --> 54:03.839
For your--                      
for your idea of happiness      

54:03.840 --> 54:07.542
In this bogus,                  
idealized world you inhabit.    

54:07.543 --> 54:08.943
                 It's not bogus.

54:08.944 --> 54:10.211
        It's real.              

54:10.212 --> 54:11.446
     And it's hard-earned.      

54:13.182 --> 54:14.516
  So what am I supposed to do,  

54:14.517 --> 54:17.051
    Just kick back and relax    

54:17.052 --> 54:18.553
     <i>While Rose is out there</i>    

54:18.554 --> 54:20.955
 Enjoying her little escapade?  

54:20.956 --> 54:22.591
    You know, I don't think     
      this is about Rose.       

54:24.494 --> 54:26.160
     I never hear you talk      
          about Casey.          

54:33.603 --> 54:34.770
Fuck off, Claire.               

54:34.771 --> 54:36.471
            Is that how you talk
                        to Rose?

54:36.472 --> 54:38.306
What could you possibly know    
about losing a child, eh?       

54:39.375 --> 54:41.342
                     I know more
                 than you think.

54:41.343 --> 54:42.511
You don't have                  
any clue.                       

54:42.512 --> 54:44.212
You have absolutely             
no clue.                        

54:45.548 --> 54:47.048
                        I've had
            two miscarriages.   

54:48.183 --> 54:49.183
Not the same.                   

54:49.184 --> 54:50.485
                     <i>I wanted</i>   
                   <i>those babies.</i>

54:50.486 --> 54:52.621
They were fetuses,              
Claire.                         

54:52.622 --> 54:55.256
Fetuses, okay?                  

54:55.257 --> 54:57.158
Casey was two.                  

54:57.159 --> 54:59.628
 <i>A living, breathing</i>            

54:59.629 --> 55:00.629
          Little boy.           

55:00.630 --> 55:02.030
      Can you grasp that?       

55:48.778 --> 55:50.345
     <i>Leave a message,</i>           
     <i>and I'll call you back.</i>    

55:56.986 --> 56:02.290
 <i>Listen, you remember that time</i> 
  <i>we drove down to Chesapeake?</i>  

56:03.626 --> 56:05.760
         What were we?          

56:05.761 --> 56:08.997
     Must have been 24, 25.     

56:08.998 --> 56:10.365
 And it started to pour so bad  

56:10.366 --> 56:12.200
         We ducked into         
    that little shoe store.     

56:12.201 --> 56:15.236
     <i>And you tried on these</i>     
   <i>beautiful Italian sandals,</i>   

56:15.237 --> 56:19.173
     <i>And I kept telling you</i>     
  <i>that they were too expensive.</i> 

56:21.744 --> 56:24.479
 <i>You looked absolutely beautiful</i>
     <i>in those sandals.</i>          

56:26.682 --> 56:28.049
   <i>And I never told you that.</i>   

56:32.989 --> 56:34.489
    I miss you, baby.           

56:39.695 --> 56:43.398
     I miss the two of you      

56:43.399 --> 56:44.699
            So much.            

56:46.468 --> 56:48.469
  <i>I'm sorry I ever blamed you.</i>  

56:51.707 --> 56:53.842
          <i>I'm so sorry.</i>         

57:26.375 --> 57:28.677
         Just a moment.         

57:35.317 --> 57:36.551
            Isabel.             

57:39.088 --> 57:40.922
I brought you                   
the chicken sandwich.           

57:40.923 --> 57:43.625
And senor Vargas'               
is here for a client,           

57:43.626 --> 57:45.226
 <i>And those</i>                      
 <i>were left over.</i>                

57:45.227 --> 57:46.227
             <i>Grazie.</i>            

57:46.228 --> 57:48.029
 <i>Can I--</i>                        

57:48.030 --> 57:49.965
Sit with you a while            
while you eat?                  

57:49.966 --> 57:51.132
             Busy.              

57:54.269 --> 57:57.739
         <i>Que paso?</i>              

57:57.740 --> 57:59.540
 <i>A bad day,</i>                     
 <i>I guess.</i>                       

58:25.567 --> 58:26.534
Thank you.                      

58:34.076 --> 58:37.078
Does she know                   
what's going on with you?       

58:37.079 --> 58:38.513
         She's from Puerto Rico.

58:38.514 --> 58:41.049
 Does she know what's happening 
      to you, Mr. Pensara?      

58:41.050 --> 58:42.550
    Do you remember meeting     

58:42.551 --> 58:44.218
     Your husband's family      
      for the first time?       

58:44.219 --> 58:46.420
       <i>Did they accept you</i>      
          <i>immediately?</i>          

58:48.024 --> 58:49.024
              Yes.              

58:49.025 --> 58:50.224
         You hesitated.         

58:50.225 --> 58:51.225
I was thinking.                 

58:51.226 --> 58:52.393
    Don't try to protect me.    

58:52.394 --> 58:53.394
            I'm not.            

58:53.395 --> 58:54.395
      <i>They didn't like you?</i>     

58:54.396 --> 58:56.597
  No, they liked me very much.  

58:58.567 --> 58:59.567
      I don't believe you.      

58:59.568 --> 59:00.735
          <i>Mr. Pensara,</i>          

59:00.736 --> 59:02.203
            I asked             
 if you told your friend Isabel 

59:02.204 --> 59:04.372
     About what's happening     
            to you.             

59:04.373 --> 59:05.674
I guess she has some idea.      

59:05.675 --> 59:08.109
You guess?                      

59:08.110 --> 59:09.911
    Do you think it'll change   
              her opinion of me?

59:09.912 --> 59:11.612
Probably not.                   

59:11.613 --> 59:13.380
             And when her family
                      finds out?

59:14.583 --> 59:15.750
You act like this is            

59:15.751 --> 59:17.351
The first time                  
you've ever fallen in love.     

59:54.757 --> 59:55.957
                         Mamita.

59:59.427 --> 01:00:00.895
            Here. Here we go.   

01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:10.371
         <i>It's delicious.</i>        

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.810
      <i>You like it, Tommaso?</i>     

01:00:18.814 --> 01:00:21.182
         When did you come here,
                         Tommas?

01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:22.884
            1958.               

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:25.186
                    Oh, that was
                a long time ago.

01:00:25.187 --> 01:00:26.620
It wasn't                       
that long ago, Christina.       

01:00:26.621 --> 01:00:27.621
                  No, I didn't--

01:00:27.622 --> 01:00:28.622
You didn't?                     

01:00:28.623 --> 01:00:30.091
    I had to get away           
        from my family.         

01:00:30.092 --> 01:00:31.893
              Why?              

01:00:37.732 --> 01:00:39.167
         My father was          
     a colonel in the army,     

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.835
                  And he told me

01:00:40.836 --> 01:00:41.969
  <i>That he was not a good person.</i>

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:43.637
    He had done bad things.     

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.320
              Oh.               

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:02.790
No.                             

01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:04.258
              Ay!               

01:01:04.259 --> 01:01:06.127
        Carlitos.               

01:01:13.235 --> 01:01:14.401
Go on, Tommas.                  

01:01:17.339 --> 01:01:19.207
        Well, he told me        
    he had been responsible     

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.774
         For the death          
      of innocent people,       

01:01:20.775 --> 01:01:23.077
   <i>That he had tortured them.</i>   

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:26.547
    How old were you?           

01:01:26.548 --> 01:01:27.581
               <i>15.</i>              

01:01:27.582 --> 01:01:29.016
        He had been sick        
     for a couple of days,      

01:01:29.017 --> 01:01:37.458
    And--and as I sat there     
          beside him,           

01:01:37.459 --> 01:01:38.759
      He pulled out a gun.      

01:01:40.195 --> 01:01:41.829
    I wasn't really scared.     

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:43.831
    My father loved me          
        very much.              

01:01:48.536 --> 01:01:49.937
    He pointed the gun          
        inside his mouth        

01:01:49.938 --> 01:01:51.072
    And shot himself.           

01:01:51.073 --> 01:01:52.273
Oh, no.                         

01:01:52.274 --> 01:01:55.176
     <i>I ran around the house,</i>    
         <i>the patio</i>              

01:01:55.177 --> 01:01:56.577
                Many, many times

01:01:56.578 --> 01:01:58.946
      Until I was sweating      
    and then sweating           

01:01:58.947 --> 01:02:00.414
         And sweating.          

01:02:00.415 --> 01:02:02.683
      You were just a boy.      

01:02:07.455 --> 01:02:12.693
That's--that's a hellish story. 

01:02:13.862 --> 01:02:17.464
        Well, you asked me      
          why I had left home.  

01:02:24.973 --> 01:02:27.041
Tommaso,                        

01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:29.176
To life.                        

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:44.058
                         You are
         a very interesting man.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.627
Not really.                     

01:02:46.628 --> 01:02:48.462
                     No, really.

01:02:48.463 --> 01:02:53.901
                I--I admire you.

01:02:53.902 --> 01:02:56.904
Te gusta la leche.              
Me gusta el cafe.               

01:02:56.905 --> 01:03:00.241
No mas me gustan                
los ojos de usted.              

01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:07.281
                You make me feel
        so wonderful, really.   

01:08:07.315 --> 01:08:10.084
                     Don't stop.

01:08:36.644 --> 01:08:37.578
        I'm Rose.               

01:08:40.348 --> 01:08:41.348
             Simon.             

01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:42.316
          I remember.           

01:08:45.987 --> 01:08:47.555
  Why did you follow me here?   

01:08:50.591 --> 01:08:53.060
         I don't know.          

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:56.497
               <i>What do you want?</i>

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:58.099
What did you think would happen?

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:04.705
        Who was the man         
        I saw you with?         

01:09:04.706 --> 01:09:06.307
        He's my husband.        

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:09.276
                 <i>Don't worry;</i>   
             <i>we're separated.</i>   

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.546
                     <i>Do you want</i>
             <i>something to drink?</i>

01:09:13.548 --> 01:09:15.015
           <i>I could get you soda.</i>

01:09:15.015 --> 01:09:16.683
                     <i>Do you want</i>
                         <i>a beer?</i>

01:09:16.684 --> 01:09:17.618
              No.               

01:09:21.656 --> 01:09:24.091
     I'm gonna have a beer.     

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.394
How old are you?                

01:09:32.966 --> 01:09:34.033
                             20.

01:09:36.304 --> 01:09:37.904
Have you ever been              
with a woman?                   

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.981
Do you want                     
to try again?                   

01:11:30.118 --> 01:11:31.418
Hit me.                         

01:11:35.823 --> 01:11:36.990
Did you hear me?                

01:11:38.059 --> 01:11:39.293
                             No.

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:40.961
Hit me.                         

01:11:42.764 --> 01:11:43.797
        I can't do that.        

01:11:43.798 --> 01:11:44.965
         Yes, you can.          

01:11:44.966 --> 01:11:45.899
            Hit me!             

01:11:47.135 --> 01:11:48.902
Hit me, Simon.                  

01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:57.278
Harder.                         

01:12:03.885 --> 01:12:05.753
Tell me                         
I'm a bad mother.               

01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:08.955
No.                             

01:12:13.227 --> 01:12:14.561
                     Bad mother.

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:44.224
 <i>Please leave.</i>                  

01:13:43.651 --> 01:13:45.586
Where were you                  
last night?                     

01:13:50.558 --> 01:13:52.493
You're just like                
your father.                    

01:14:01.969 --> 01:14:02.903
          Ma!                   

01:14:08.242 --> 01:14:11.478
 <i>If you're not gonna help me,</i>   
                   <i>then get out.</i>

01:15:13.741 --> 01:15:15.909
This is ridiculous.             

01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.712
I'll have to leave              
eventually.                     

01:15:18.713 --> 01:15:19.980
Either I will                   
or you will                     

01:15:19.981 --> 01:15:21.582
Because you'll get caught       
helping me.                     

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:24.284
                I'll be fine.   

01:15:24.285 --> 01:15:26.219
                I'll be fine.   

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:39.900
            Carlitos asked me   
if he would be seeing you again,

01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:43.370
                 And I said yes.

01:15:43.371 --> 01:15:44.571
        Was that a good idea?   

01:15:46.107 --> 01:15:47.374
I don't know,                   
Isabel.                         

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:57.151
            What did you feel   
                 when we kissed?

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:59.586
I felt happy.                   

01:16:00.755 --> 01:16:01.822
             You seem uncertain.

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.157
I'm not uncertain.              

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:06.393
                 My heart raced.

01:16:06.394 --> 01:16:09.029
                      Did yours?

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:10.030
I don't know.                   

01:16:13.668 --> 01:16:15.069
             You don't remember?

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:17.604
No, I remember.                 

01:16:21.642 --> 01:16:22.843
I'll always remember.           

01:16:41.495 --> 01:16:44.131
Uh, meet me                     

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.132
After work                      
in the park,                    

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:47.601
And we'll                       
discuss it then.                

01:19:26.594 --> 01:19:29.462
Peter's poem clearly illustrates
the use of metaphor.            

01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:43.403
                  How's it going
        with your friend Isabel?

01:20:43.404 --> 01:20:45.339
It doesn't seem to be           
working out.                    

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.008
                    I'm sorry   
                to hear that.   

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.642
It's okay.                      

01:20:49.643 --> 01:20:51.278
We weren't right                
for each other.                 

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:54.581
 Sometimes that's hard to tell. 

01:20:54.582 --> 01:20:56.950
     Um, read the top line.     

01:20:58.719 --> 01:21:07.194
 <i>H, c, a, g.</i>                    

01:21:11.899 --> 01:21:13.166
How long have you been married? 

01:21:13.167 --> 01:21:14.767
        Six years.              

01:21:14.768 --> 01:21:16.203
 What's a typical evening like? 

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:18.972
        My husband and I        
         are separated.         

01:21:18.973 --> 01:21:20.707
        Do you miss him?        

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:24.077
        Sometimes.              

01:21:27.615 --> 01:21:31.885
      I--I bought a cane.       

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.453
          That's good.          

01:21:33.454 --> 01:21:34.388
      That will help you.       

01:21:36.624 --> 01:21:39.059
         About Isabel,          
can I ask you a question?       

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.927
              Yes.              

01:21:40.928 --> 01:21:43.596
Can you imagine your life       
          without her?          

01:21:43.597 --> 01:21:45.965
        Before or after         
         this happened?         

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:51.804
      I guess there's only      
          the present.          

01:22:15.996 --> 01:22:19.433
                         This is
              a wide-angle lens.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:21.168
          Please don't break it,
                          Simon.

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:41.120
     I appeal to the stars.     

01:22:41.121 --> 01:22:43.824
     My heart peeled loose      
          in the wind.          

01:23:44.318 --> 01:23:45.752
          Oh, damn it.          

01:23:45.753 --> 01:23:47.420
        Excuse me, sir?         

01:23:47.421 --> 01:23:48.755
What is it?                     

01:23:48.756 --> 01:23:49.756
What do you want?               

01:23:49.757 --> 01:23:50.757
            Do you need help?   

01:23:50.758 --> 01:23:51.992
Leave me alone.                 

01:23:59.867 --> 01:24:01.267
              Excuse me, please.

01:24:01.268 --> 01:24:04.170
Yeah, yeah?                     

01:24:04.171 --> 01:24:07.007
                I need to get   
    to the m-train to queens.   

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:08.909
                 Like, I'm going
                to booth street.

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:12.712
Um, you got to take             
the 1-train to times square.    

01:24:12.713 --> 01:24:14.347
But you got to get on           
the other side.                 

01:24:22.823 --> 01:24:24.958
                Can you help me?

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.459
Yeah.                           

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:27.460
Yeah, come on.                  

01:24:27.461 --> 01:24:29.395
It's this way.                  

01:24:34.401 --> 01:24:35.435
            What's your name?   

01:24:35.436 --> 01:24:36.736
Simon.                          

01:24:36.737 --> 01:24:37.737
What about you?                 

01:24:37.738 --> 01:24:39.105
                  Simon. My name
              is Tommaso, Simon.

01:24:39.106 --> 01:24:40.206
Tommas.                         
What is that?                   

01:24:40.207 --> 01:24:42.241
                      Thank you.
     Tommaso is an Italian name.

01:24:42.242 --> 01:24:43.509
Italian.                        

01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:46.012
What, but you got               
a really thick new York accent. 

01:24:46.013 --> 01:24:47.681
        I've been in new York   
          since a long time now.

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:48.715
A long time.                    

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:51.417
                I'm going to see
              my friend, Isabel.
