00:01.168 --> 00:03.268
<i>Escaped prisoner David Slaney</i>

00:03.303 --> 00:04.770
<i>is still at large
having escaped</i>

00:04.805 --> 00:07.939
<i>from Dorchester Penitentiary
a few short hours ago.</i>

00:07.974 --> 00:11.743
<i>Five years ago, Slaney went
down and Hearn, he disappeared.</i>

00:11.778 --> 00:14.012
We're gonna have to put
the past behind us.

00:14.047 --> 00:16.081
Stop! Don't hurt him!

00:16.116 --> 00:19.718
- <i>So no one else knows what we're doing.</i>
- <i>There's no other way.</i>

00:19.753 --> 00:21.720
<i>There's an actual
manhunt for me!</i>

00:29.162 --> 00:31.129
Wake up.

00:38.138 --> 00:41.073
Remember me?

00:42.909 --> 00:45.677
I was there
when your pal Hearn got away

00:45.712 --> 00:49.815
leaving you holding the bag.
- Oh, I remember you.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.617
You're that cop
that was so drunk at the trial

00:52.652 --> 00:54.786
that you threw up
over all the evidence.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.324
What do you want from me?
- Well, I want what I know

00:59.359 --> 01:01.827
you want, David.
Can I call you David?

01:01.862 --> 01:04.496
Hearn's out there living it up,
building an empire.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.865
You're in here.
- Look, you really think

01:06.900 --> 01:09.868
you're the first asshole to come
in here and try this routine?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.870
You should look

01:11.905 --> 01:14.073
at your face.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.176
I know Tommy Gabriel's guys been
beating the piss out of you.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.145
Tommy wants you to give him
Hearn. So you should

01:20.180 --> 01:21.913
ask yourself this question
next time those guys

01:21.948 --> 01:24.283
are pounding you to
within an inch of your life...

01:25.652 --> 01:29.421
...would Hearn hold out for you
or would he just give you up?

01:29.456 --> 01:32.557
I don't even know
where he is.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.260
Maybe that's true. I'll be
honest, I almost believe you,

01:35.295 --> 01:37.429
but I know you can get
in touch with him,

01:37.464 --> 01:41.299
which means that you and me...

01:41.334 --> 01:44.570
...you and me could find him.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.489
Pills.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.393
My pills.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.240
Where?

02:55.275 --> 02:57.643
Where are they?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.815
Open your mouth.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.294
You forced me
to break out of prison.

03:21.101 --> 03:24.903
- We gotta finish this.
- You're on your own, Patterson.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.175
You lied to me.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.977
Our deal's off.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.953
♪ Come on the rising wind ♪

03:41.988 --> 03:45.924
♪ We're going up
around the bend ♪

03:45.959 --> 03:48.059
♪ Yeah ♪

04:05.145 --> 04:07.112
Easy, killer, don't shoot.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.447
Oh, this is quite

04:09.482 --> 04:11.483
the interesting place
you got here.

04:11.518 --> 04:14.286
Wallpaper's inspirational.
- It helps me think.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.755
What are you doing here?
- Your pal Murrin

04:16.790 --> 04:19.824
called me, told me
about the accident.

04:19.859 --> 04:22.093
- Mm-hmm.
- So the plan was

04:22.128 --> 04:24.529
for Slaney to lead you to Hearn?

04:24.564 --> 04:28.266
- Mm-hmm.
- Without him knowing?

04:28.301 --> 04:30.802
But you picked him up, why?

04:30.837 --> 04:33.772
He was being chased by
some hillbillies for a reward.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.374
When I see
he waved me down, I just...

04:36.409 --> 04:39.010
I had to stop.

04:39.045 --> 04:42.314
He thought I was one of them;
he tried to jump out of the car.

04:42.349 --> 04:45.016
He thought
you were a hillbilly?

04:45.051 --> 04:47.319
Mm-hmm.

04:47.354 --> 04:50.955
Get dressed,
let's get to work.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.124
"Let's" as in like us

04:53.159 --> 04:54.893
or together?

04:54.928 --> 04:57.395
Because you made it...

04:57.430 --> 04:59.397
...you made it pretty clear

04:59.432 --> 05:01.599
that you didn't want
any part of this.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.469
I did, but I changed my mind.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.539
You still want my help?

05:07.574 --> 05:09.674
- Mhm.
- I took a week's sick leave,

05:09.709 --> 05:12.911
so I'm all yours,
'til you piss me off.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.347
All right then.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.790
Hi. How do you think I can help you?

05:25.825 --> 05:29.694
Give me 500K.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.496
500! Yeah, no, sure,

05:31.531 --> 05:34.065
I'll send that right along with
a load of my ass you can kiss.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.000
What? You don't like
opportunity all of a sudden?

05:36.035 --> 05:38.136
You've invested before.
- From what I hear, you got

05:38.171 --> 05:41.773
like a row of feds lined up
bobbing for your head
like an apple,

05:41.808 --> 05:44.042
so yeah, I'm gonna
send you 500,000.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.511
You let me worry about that.
Look, I wouldn't come to you

05:46.546 --> 05:49.080
if this was a risk.
It's a sure thing.

05:49.115 --> 05:53.385
What is in it for me...
<i>exactement?</i>

05:53.420 --> 05:57.656
- Six points.
- Well, twenty points and maybe we can talk.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.794
Look... I know
you got this granddaughter,

06:07.734 --> 06:10.869
You leave my granddaughter
out of this.

06:10.904 --> 06:14.439
You can't get the money
together, I'll just go
to someone else.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.641
Screw you,
I can get it together.

06:19.078 --> 06:20.845
It's what I like to hear.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.047
My guy will be there
to pick it up soon.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.851
But he's gonna need a passport
like the one that you gave me.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.822
Just make sure
the money's ready.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.766
<i>You're sure
you're OK there, darlin'?</i>

06:41.801 --> 06:43.768
<i>You don't look so good.</i>

06:43.803 --> 06:47.405
I'm fine. I just had
a little... car accident.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.708
Nothing a nap won't fix.

06:51.544 --> 06:54.579
TV gets the two channels.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.982
Shower works. Don't flush
anything big down the toilet.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.351
Plumbing seems to resist
everything we throw in it.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.487
<i>...still believed
to be dangerous.</i>

07:02.522 --> 07:04.255
My program's on
in a minute, so...

07:04.290 --> 07:07.158
<i>...with roadblocks
set up across the province</i>

07:07.193 --> 07:09.828
<i>as well as a heavier police
presence at all airports.</i>

07:46.399 --> 07:48.767
How long
have you been sober?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.738
What? You think I didn't look
into you before I came here?

07:59.145 --> 08:02.413
Two years, three months,
sixteen days.

08:02.448 --> 08:05.450
What else did you
dig up on me?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.585
Hmm...

08:07.620 --> 08:09.888
You've been riding a desk
for the last few years.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.090
From what I can tell,
you haven't been doing

08:12.125 --> 08:14.192
much real police work.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.394
And you were point

08:16.429 --> 08:18.196
on the Slaney-Hearn case
five years ago.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.965
I let Hearn get away,
it's all true.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.968
What happened?

08:24.671 --> 08:27.038
I was distracted.
I wasn't there. I blew it.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.749
Roy Patterson. Yeah.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.554
OK, good. Good work.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.026
Murrin tracked Slaney
to a hotel

08:48.061 --> 08:50.695
out on Highway 2.
Owner called it in.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.853
They're looked after.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.756
Yeah, well...

09:18.791 --> 09:20.825
nothing says I love you like...

09:20.860 --> 09:23.027
alimony and child support.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.829
Yeah...

09:24.864 --> 09:26.798
Well, I'm, um...

09:26.833 --> 09:30.035
I thought you were a dentist
with a house on the beach.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.973
I mean,
we are on the beach,

09:35.008 --> 09:37.642
and... and I was
a dentist.

09:37.677 --> 09:42.180
But living like this
is just so much more fun.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.851
Is what you're doing gonna
land us in a Mexican jail?

09:46.886 --> 09:50.221
'Cause I hear
those are tons of fun.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.160
What?

09:56.195 --> 09:58.796
I-I know.

09:58.831 --> 10:02.300
I would have to be
an idiot not to know.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.505
Because you see,
the problem being with you,

10:07.540 --> 10:11.175
even just looking
at you, you...

10:11.210 --> 10:14.712
I can't explain
the way it makes me feel.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.348
I can't explain the way
<i>you</i> make me feel.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.517
We both tend to...

10:19.552 --> 10:21.252
You know,

10:21.287 --> 10:24.188
we explain too much sometimes,

10:24.223 --> 10:26.224
don't you think?

10:28.027 --> 10:30.261
OK.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.297
I... am in control

10:33.332 --> 10:35.533
of absolutely everything

10:35.568 --> 10:37.802
no matter what goes on
around us.

10:37.837 --> 10:41.305
OK. Well, I don't like
your buddy Hearn.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.107
He's all bark.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.277
Hearn? You think
I'm afraid of Hearn?

10:46.312 --> 10:49.547
I can handle Hearn.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.516
Don't worry, baby.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.970
Oh, gee! Do you mind?!

11:14.941 --> 11:17.275
Lefevre is gonna
give us the money.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.179
Slaney is gonna pick it up.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.248
And Hugo's close to a deal
with his people.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.918
Uh... OK.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.487
I know how many you sling.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.094
I need your former self.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.300
OK.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.535
<i>I love you.</i>

12:52.772 --> 12:54.972
<i>I love you too.</i>

13:05.751 --> 13:07.252
You guys, go in there!

13:08.888 --> 13:11.356
Ugh!

13:21.834 --> 13:24.936
They said the manager is on
this floor, I'm gonna find her.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.871
All right,
I'll take the second.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.925
- Just tell us what you saw.
- Yeah, uh...

13:47.960 --> 13:50.995
Master key. Slaney's in 213.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.992
Hi.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.860
I don't want Paul to see
the dress before

14:22.895 --> 14:25.796
I'm at the altar, obviously.
Is he around? Can you help me

14:25.831 --> 14:27.465
with this?

14:27.500 --> 14:30.034
Sure, I just... I'm gonna need
some more light.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.142
- Better help me with the dress.

15:45.411 --> 15:48.479
My wife... my ex-wife...

15:50.850 --> 15:53.217
...she likes to stay
on top of it hoping for -

15:53.252 --> 15:56.253
or not, I don't know - accident.
I don't know anymore.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.556
Is that what this is about?

15:58.591 --> 16:01.225
Think getting Hearn
will make up for it?

16:01.260 --> 16:03.928
I'm not an idiot.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.963
I just wanna nail him
so I can have

16:05.998 --> 16:08.199
a decent night's sleep for once.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.005
Jennifer Baker's a single mom.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.540
Slaney's not the father correct?
- No, he isn't,

16:16.575 --> 16:18.376
but...

16:20.246 --> 16:23.581
...he wrote to her every month
while he was inside,

16:23.616 --> 16:26.250
and all those letters
were returned unopened.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.319
And I had them all pulled
from the prison

16:28.354 --> 16:30.855
about a year ago. Went through
them all, it's a dead-end.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.057
She lives in Newfoundland,

16:33.092 --> 16:35.526
and Slaney's never
going back there.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.328
What's this?

16:37.363 --> 16:39.764
The letter from the hotel.

16:47.073 --> 16:50.474
- She moved.
- She moved.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.210
You pine for a girl in prison,

16:53.245 --> 16:55.279
write her every month,
not one reply.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.448
She finally tells you
she never wants to see you

16:57.483 --> 16:59.450
again, what are you gonna do?
- Well, oh, my God,

16:59.485 --> 17:02.253
I'd do the opposite.
I'd go right to her.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.221
How far is the drive
to Montreal?

17:04.256 --> 17:06.457
Are you driving or am I?

17:31.517 --> 17:33.117
Took you long enough
to get there.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.986
Being an escaped con tends
to slow things down a little.

17:36.021 --> 17:38.856
If you're in a hurry, maybe you
should have got someone else.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.324
Relax.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.560
I didn't make you
bust out of jail, Slaney.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.796
No, you just got me sent there
in the first place.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.765
1017, Morisette.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.602
And, uh, count the 500.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.738
Lefevre, he's harmless
but slippery.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.907
You sent me to Montreal
to pick up that much cash

17:56.942 --> 18:00.644
without any protection
or a plan to get me out of here?

18:00.679 --> 18:03.013
Uh, I have a plan.

18:03.048 --> 18:06.851
Don't start acting like
I should trust you
all of a sudden.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.453
You're still a pain
in the ass, you know that?

18:09.488 --> 18:11.555
Tommy Gabriel and his brothers
are gonna know that I'm out.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.058
They're gonna be
looking for me.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.260
OK. So then,

18:16.295 --> 18:18.262
you get the money

18:18.297 --> 18:21.766
and you get out
as soon as possible, all right?

18:23.068 --> 18:24.668
No detours.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.310
Ah, you're kidding me.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.312
You're kidding me!
How did you know

18:35.347 --> 18:37.314
she was in Montreal, man?

18:37.349 --> 18:39.783
Just watch yourself.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.785
She wrote me.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.388
Jennifer... Hahaha!

18:44.423 --> 18:47.391
After all these years,
you gotta be kidding me.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.360
That funny to you?

18:49.395 --> 18:53.063
Haha! What?

18:53.098 --> 18:55.299
Wait, you don't know?

19:05.044 --> 19:07.545
What?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.313
Oh, pal,

19:09.348 --> 19:11.549
I'm sorry. She's married.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.904
You're just gonna have
to forget about her,

19:33.939 --> 19:36.207
move on, right?

19:42.748 --> 19:44.882
The days you tell me
what I can

19:44.917 --> 19:46.650
and can't do are over.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.087
Don't be a stubborn
son of a bitch, you--

19:59.898 --> 20:03.434
I trust you more than
anybody in the world, man.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.470
I got your back;
you got mine.

20:06.505 --> 20:09.406
We could build
something big here.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.508
- Something like what?
- Haha! Ha!

20:11.543 --> 20:14.678
Like a weed empire, man!

20:14.713 --> 20:18.182
You know,
meet a couple of girls,

20:18.217 --> 20:19.984
swimming pools,
big houses.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.896
No, you can't
have it, you're too little.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.366
Ahem!

20:35.401 --> 20:37.401
Well, look who it is.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.803
Jennifer Baker.
- The Slane?

20:39.838 --> 20:43.407
Oh, my God,
it's good to see you!

20:43.442 --> 20:45.109
I haven't seen you
since we were...

20:45.144 --> 20:49.113
- In high school.
- Yeah.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.215
I asked you out,
you said, "Maybe."

20:51.250 --> 20:54.752
And as I recall, you just up
and moved away after that.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.754
That was like
three months later,

20:56.789 --> 20:59.590
but yeah, my dad,
he got a job in Alberta.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.325
Ah.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.360
So, uh, my proposal

21:03.395 --> 21:05.396
wasn't the cause
of your relocation?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.798
Believe it or not, no.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.904
I wanted to ask you out
since we were 9 years old.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.641
You need to learn

21:17.676 --> 21:20.010
to move a little quicker.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.813
Last I heard, you ended up
with Jessica Shannahan,

21:22.848 --> 21:25.316
so looks like you got
over me pretty quickly.

21:25.351 --> 21:28.352
Oh, I never got over you.

21:31.890 --> 21:35.192
Who's this little trout?
- That's Crystal.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.194
Some eyes on you.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.530
Like your mother.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.468
You're looking for a wedding
ring, you're not gonna find it.

21:44.503 --> 21:47.004
- No, no, I was just--
- Her father, he's not

21:47.039 --> 21:48.806
in the picture, so...

21:48.841 --> 21:50.107
You...

21:50.142 --> 21:53.010
Oh, your ice cream.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.714
What am I...? After doing...
No, this is all your fault,

21:56.749 --> 21:58.916
you were distracting me!
- That was my big play:

21:58.951 --> 22:01.952
make you lose your ice cream
so I could buy you another one.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.358
Jennifer Juniper.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.593
How are you?

22:10.929 --> 22:11.929
I'm good.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.500
There you go.

22:16.535 --> 22:18.869
We should, uh...
we should get the bus.

22:20.539 --> 22:24.108
It was really good seeing you.
- You too.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.285
On the monkey bars.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.662
We got him.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.669
I heard you on the phone.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.805
Anyone ever tell you
what happens to little girls

22:54.840 --> 22:58.842
who eavesdrop?
- Little girls?

22:58.877 --> 23:01.044
Man, you sure know
how to talk to women.

23:01.079 --> 23:04.582
Who's Slaney?

23:06.718 --> 23:09.553
He's the guy you and Carter
have been talking about, right?

23:09.588 --> 23:13.524
What did I just say to you?

23:13.559 --> 23:16.127
Hola.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.130
Is that tooth
still bothering you?

23:20.165 --> 23:22.332
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause when I looked at it,

23:22.367 --> 23:24.601
I was like...

23:24.636 --> 23:26.837
Oh, <i>mio amore.</i>

23:29.875 --> 23:32.443
I think it's gotta come out.
What do you say?

23:32.478 --> 23:34.445
- Do it.
- Yeah, if I were you,

23:34.480 --> 23:37.181
I wouldn't be gentle.
He could use a jolt.

23:39.818 --> 23:42.152
Do you think
that maybe you could wait

23:42.187 --> 23:44.955
until you're finished
before you get high?

23:44.990 --> 23:47.624
Oh, he's been high all day,
why stop now?

23:47.659 --> 23:49.760
Open up. Hmm!

23:54.867 --> 23:55.966
Here.

23:56.001 --> 23:59.236
I don't think this is
gonna need stitches.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.639
Ah! Ah.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.610
Ah! Argh! AH!
- Oooh!

24:06.645 --> 24:09.046
Oh, God! Dammit! Idiot!

24:09.081 --> 24:12.716
Ah!
- Just a little bit of blood.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.751
You just have to...

24:14.786 --> 24:16.887
Oh, God, man, let me...

24:16.922 --> 24:18.889
I'm sorry
about that, man.

24:18.924 --> 24:21.492
I'm gonna go get some gauze.
Ada, would you clean him up?

24:33.438 --> 24:36.540
- It's rotten right through.
- That makes sense.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.845
That girl in the photo,
were you in love with her?

24:42.681 --> 24:45.415
Coke makes me chatty.
You know,

24:45.450 --> 24:48.485
Cyril said that he used
to use teabags to numb the pain,

24:48.520 --> 24:51.188
but coke works way better.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.996
I collect stories.

24:59.031 --> 25:02.165
I want yours,
so if I were you,

25:02.200 --> 25:04.334
I would just give in.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.570
She was pretty.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.610
Don't...

25:13.645 --> 25:16.514
try that shit with me.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.585
I'm not Carter.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.755
I'm real. You understand that?

25:26.558 --> 25:29.860
Remember that.

25:29.895 --> 25:33.263
OK.

25:33.298 --> 25:35.266
Let me take a look at it.

25:37.002 --> 25:39.203
Let me take
a look at it.

25:42.841 --> 25:45.142
We saw him
go in there, but are we sure

25:45.177 --> 25:48.745
he's still inside?
- He's still in there.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.048
What are you thinking?

25:53.185 --> 25:55.953
I was thinking
about your missing girl.

26:02.461 --> 26:04.695
I was a runaway.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.265
I was 14.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.970
Took off to Detroit.

26:13.005 --> 26:16.039
On my own.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.375
You know I got my way
into trouble.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.711
Hmm.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.448
Yeah, me with no discipline.

26:24.483 --> 26:26.550
Haha!

26:26.585 --> 26:29.253
There was drugs, all that.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.458
Anyways, I got busted

26:34.493 --> 26:36.460
on some bullshit thing.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.462
It was a minor drug charge,

26:38.497 --> 26:41.064
and it felt
like a major one.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.866
The FBI used it.

26:42.901 --> 26:45.135
They held it over me,
flipped me.

26:47.639 --> 26:50.674
After a while,
I was recruited to DEA...

26:51.943 --> 26:55.746
...full-fledged law enforcement.
- Whoa.

26:55.781 --> 26:58.248
People sometimes...

27:01.119 --> 27:03.954
...they need
to reinvent themselves

27:03.989 --> 27:06.090
for their own reasons.

27:09.227 --> 27:11.628
Just because she's gone
from your life

27:11.663 --> 27:14.264
doesn't mean
she isn't living.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.700
That should give you hope.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.338
Hope deserted me
a long time ago.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.715
I'm on foot.

28:03.682 --> 28:08.052
Well, well, well, if it isn't
the convict of interest.

28:15.827 --> 28:18.495
Hearn set this up
so you could kill me?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.564
With friends like that...

28:20.599 --> 28:23.700
He sends the most wanted man
in Canada to pick up the money.

28:23.735 --> 28:26.169
If you're not actually
planning on shooting me,

28:26.204 --> 28:28.772
would you mind not...
- Oh, yeah.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.407
Sorry.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.576
Ah, so...

28:32.611 --> 28:34.845
...you bust out of the pen

28:34.880 --> 28:36.847
and you jump straight
into the fire.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.049
Were you followed?

28:39.084 --> 28:41.251
- No.
- Yeah, like you would know.

28:41.286 --> 28:44.921
The bad people in the city
wanna see you and Hearn

28:44.956 --> 28:46.556
<i>très</i> dead.

28:46.591 --> 28:50.594
I don't like me being here
any more than you do,

28:50.629 --> 28:52.496
but I need that money.

28:53.765 --> 28:56.199
You know, Tommy Gabriel
is a much bigger deal

28:56.234 --> 28:58.668
than when you two
ripped him off.

28:58.703 --> 29:01.271
He and his brother
moving a lot of shit

29:01.306 --> 29:05.109
for the Angels.

29:09.181 --> 29:10.781
Emphysema?

29:10.816 --> 29:12.649
Yeah.

29:12.684 --> 29:16.052
Yeah, I hear
smoking's the cure.

29:16.087 --> 29:19.790
You're just like my wife.
May she rest in peace.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.927
- $500,000.
- Yeah.

29:23.962 --> 29:25.729
Either give it to me or don't,
it's up to you.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.532
Get your picture taken, OK,
in one of these photo booths.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.834
You know the kind, right?

29:33.205 --> 29:35.205
And then you iron
the picture on

29:35.240 --> 29:38.942
under the plastic under there.
The name in there

29:38.977 --> 29:41.378
is the one on the tombstone
next to my wife's.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.347
It's your name now.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.050
Meet me in three hours

29:47.085 --> 29:50.654
at the gateway
to Haven Cemetery, alright?
You'll get your money then.

29:50.689 --> 29:53.490
You were supposed
to give me the money now.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.392
Yeah, things change.

30:01.366 --> 30:04.234
Hey, I can give you
a pretty good deal on that.

30:04.269 --> 30:06.469
They just fell off
a truck this morning.

30:06.504 --> 30:08.539
Got a full load out front.

30:13.912 --> 30:17.047
Three hours.
Just be there with the money.

30:24.689 --> 30:26.890
Slaney's got a passport.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.965
- What's with the doll?
- Weird gift for Hearn.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.667
Got a present
for Jennifer's kid.

30:37.702 --> 30:40.470
We gotta get surveillance
up inside her apartment.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.305
- How do you plan on doing that?
- Oh, I'm not gonna do that,

30:42.340 --> 30:45.576
you're gonna do that.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.759
Hi! Sorry, my husband,

31:02.794 --> 31:04.561
he's at work right now.

31:04.596 --> 31:07.464
Can you hang on just one second?
That thing has been ringing

31:07.499 --> 31:09.433
all morning.

31:12.737 --> 31:14.604
Hello? Hi!

31:34.626 --> 31:36.526
Whatchu doin'?

31:36.561 --> 31:39.363
Uh, just... I have
these books for you.

31:41.166 --> 31:44.034
<i>If your mommy agrees.</i>

31:46.304 --> 31:48.505
- Can I help you?
- Hi!

31:48.540 --> 31:51.408
Yeah, I just was here
to discuss this one's future.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.177
She's quite the smart cookie.
- Encyclopaedias, we can't.

31:54.212 --> 31:56.279
We can't afford that
right now.

31:56.314 --> 31:58.415
Our prices
are pretty competitive.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.150
No thank you.

32:00.185 --> 32:02.819
You should think about it.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.621
Uh, Miss, your books.

32:04.656 --> 32:07.090
Here, we gotta give
this nice woman her books back.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.392
<i>Honestly. No, it's policy.</i>

32:09.427 --> 32:11.461
I have to leave them as a gift
because my boss thinks

32:11.496 --> 32:14.998
it'll make you call for more.
So just enjoy.

32:19.004 --> 32:21.204
That was weird.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.250
We're up. Good work.

32:37.088 --> 32:39.256
Oh, I get it.
Now you want 'em back.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.608
Look how big
you are, Crystal.

33:34.979 --> 33:37.981
My goodness!

33:38.016 --> 33:40.751
Look at you.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.893
Here, I got you this.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.829
My dad bought me
the same one,

33:52.864 --> 33:55.398
but I cut its hair off.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.067
Keep your scissors away
from this one.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.190
She is...

34:20.225 --> 34:22.325
just beautiful.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.598
So are you.

34:33.671 --> 34:36.640
I suppose
congratulations are in order.

34:38.476 --> 34:42.279
It's a big step getting married.
- Don't... you start with me.

34:43.548 --> 34:45.915
Do you know
that Child services came around?

34:45.950 --> 34:47.784
Right after you went down,

34:47.819 --> 34:51.521
they questioned
whether I was a fit mother.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.367
Is he good to you?

35:04.402 --> 35:07.270
Why, he's not a fugitive
for starters,

35:07.305 --> 35:10.440
and she needed a father.
- That's not what I asked.

35:12.310 --> 35:14.611
Why are you here?

35:24.255 --> 35:26.689
Do you love him?

35:26.724 --> 35:30.594
This is none
of your damn business.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.300
- Do you love him?
- Yes.

35:41.272 --> 35:43.773
Do you?

35:43.808 --> 35:45.141
Yes.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.177
Just tell me

35:47.212 --> 35:49.946
the truth, Jennifer, please.

35:52.283 --> 35:55.685
Do you... love him?

35:58.122 --> 36:00.190
No.

36:24.215 --> 36:27.350
You think I don't feel that?

36:29.821 --> 36:31.554
There's never been a day

36:31.589 --> 36:33.556
that I didn't wish
you were here,

36:33.591 --> 36:36.793
<i>but life isn't like that.</i>

36:39.831 --> 36:42.232
I knew you'd end up in prison
or worse.

36:42.267 --> 36:46.002
You promised to stay away
from... stay away from Hearn.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.306
Promise?

36:50.341 --> 36:52.475
I don't care. I don't care

36:52.510 --> 36:54.244
about any of that.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.980
You and me... Look at me.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.815
You and me and Crystal,

36:58.850 --> 37:02.085
we leave. Right now,
we leave all of this behind.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.720
Shit!

37:03.755 --> 37:05.688
If she says yes,
we're finished.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.391
- Forgive me.
- I do. I don't care.

37:08.426 --> 37:10.393
I don't care
about any of that.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.462
About money,
about any of that.

37:12.497 --> 37:14.898
Just... I need you,
I can't live without you.

37:19.937 --> 37:23.473
You want me
to take my daughter

37:23.508 --> 37:26.476
and live on the run?

37:28.146 --> 37:31.414
Like fugitives.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.416
As fugitives.

37:36.287 --> 37:38.888
Are you out of your mind?

37:40.992 --> 37:43.493
Please don't make me do this.

37:43.528 --> 37:45.829
Please don't
make me say this.

37:47.632 --> 37:49.766
You know she has
to be protected.

37:51.235 --> 37:54.304
But I say no, where do you go?
You go right back to him.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.139
You go right back
to Hearn.

37:56.174 --> 37:59.576
And that can't be on me, David.
That can't be on Crystal.

38:01.546 --> 38:03.513
There is nothing on you,

38:03.548 --> 38:05.615
what are you talking about?

38:05.650 --> 38:08.718
All this time,
there has been something...

38:08.753 --> 38:11.020
there's been
something between us,

38:11.055 --> 38:14.023
and it's my fault because...

38:14.058 --> 38:17.327
I thought I was protecting you.

38:21.199 --> 38:23.199
Protecting me from what?

38:23.234 --> 38:25.635
Hearn.

38:27.105 --> 38:29.005
He's rotten inside and out.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.541
I don't want you
talking about him.

38:34.579 --> 38:37.514
I was at a party.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.919
And I was drunk,
and I was passed out.

38:46.657 --> 38:50.327
And I woke up
with Hearn on top of me.

38:52.697 --> 38:54.864
And I tried to push him off
'cause at first, I thought

38:54.899 --> 38:57.433
he was joking.

38:57.468 --> 38:59.435
And then I looked
into his eyes

38:59.470 --> 39:01.938
and I saw who he was,
I saw what he was.

39:04.308 --> 39:06.609
And then he put his hand

39:06.644 --> 39:09.779
over my mouth
and he held me down, and he...

39:11.582 --> 39:14.517
...just kept going.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.658
When I was in jail?

39:25.830 --> 39:27.864
Before.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.702
Before when?

39:38.676 --> 39:41.778
You mean Crystal,
don't you?

39:41.813 --> 39:43.746
Finally.

39:43.781 --> 39:46.349
I kept thinking
if I just told you

39:46.384 --> 39:48.384
you never would have gone
on that boat,

39:48.419 --> 39:49.719
you never would
have got caught, you...

39:49.754 --> 39:53.957
you never would have spent
five years in prison.

39:56.227 --> 40:01.397
No.

40:01.432 --> 40:03.600
You're wrong.

40:06.304 --> 40:09.038
If you had told me,
I would have done 30 years

40:09.073 --> 40:11.474
because I would have
killed him.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.114
I am only here

40:18.149 --> 40:19.982
because of you.

40:20.017 --> 40:22.452
I had you here;
that's the only reason

40:22.487 --> 40:24.754
why I'm alive,
do you understand?

40:26.524 --> 40:28.892
I owe you my life.

40:31.996 --> 40:35.565
I'm sorry. I...

40:35.600 --> 40:38.501
I love you.

40:38.536 --> 40:40.636
- No.
- I will always love you.

40:40.671 --> 40:43.506
No. No.

40:43.541 --> 40:46.075
You need to leave.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.579
Please.

40:51.148 --> 40:54.551
You need to go home.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.709
Mr. Knight.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.777
I never knew the guy,
but his name is

41:21.812 --> 41:23.546
right next to my wife,
so I see it every day.

41:23.581 --> 41:26.816
"Douglas Knight," it's got
a ring to it, don't you think?

41:26.851 --> 41:28.818
I don't mean
to be disrespectful--

41:28.853 --> 41:31.054
Yeah, well,
then don't be.

41:33.624 --> 41:36.692
What do you have
on the old guy?

41:36.727 --> 41:38.995
It's Andre Lefevre.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.364
He's a small-time bookie
and money launderer.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.866
Why is Slaney

41:43.901 --> 41:46.235
meeting him here?
- If you don't mind...

41:46.270 --> 41:48.905
where's the money?

41:48.940 --> 41:51.607
Behind the tombstone.

41:51.642 --> 41:54.210
Yeah, "your" tombstone.

42:03.955 --> 42:07.290
I'm assuming it's all here,
I don't need to count it?

42:07.325 --> 42:10.159
May I ask you something?
What's to stop you

42:10.194 --> 42:12.061
from just taking the money
and disappearing?

42:12.096 --> 42:14.363
Oh, I'm gonna
see Hearn, believe me.

42:14.398 --> 42:16.599
We got a lot to talk about.

42:18.402 --> 42:20.970
This woman,

42:21.005 --> 42:22.905
she was the smartest person
I ever met. I mean,

42:22.940 --> 42:25.041
except for one thing:

42:25.076 --> 42:27.376
she loved me
'til her dying breath.

42:27.411 --> 42:30.680
Count yourself
as one of the lucky ones.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.918
Hey.

42:35.953 --> 42:39.555
Does this look right
to you? Cadillac?

42:39.590 --> 42:41.791
Who the hell is that?

42:45.630 --> 42:47.330
That's Tommy Gabriel.

42:47.365 --> 42:50.900
Well, this got
a whole lot more interesting.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.902
- <i>Oh, câlisse.</i>
- Did you do this?

42:52.937 --> 42:55.939
<i>Non, c'est pas moi.</i>

43:10.521 --> 43:13.723
