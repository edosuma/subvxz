01:29.989 --> 01:31.957
Whoa!

01:36.362 --> 01:38.330
Mush!

01:44.270 --> 01:46.170
Now beat it!

01:46.272 --> 01:49.673
All right, I'll leave, if
that's the way you feel about it.

01:49.775 --> 01:51.743
But I'll leave like a gentleman.

02:01.020 --> 02:04.148
Quiet, everybody! Ladies and
gentlemen, your attention, please!

02:04.257 --> 02:08.158
You're about to take your last look at
Mr. Thornton's handsome, smiling face.

02:08.261 --> 02:10.592
So make the most of it, you weasels!

02:13.132 --> 02:15.293
But, as a last insane gesture...

02:15.401 --> 02:19.394
Mr. Thornton wants you all to step up
to the bar and have a drink with him!

02:19.505 --> 02:21.405
Quiet!

02:21.507 --> 02:24.533
Are you ready? Let's go!
To the bar, everybody!

02:24.644 --> 02:26.578
There you are!

02:50.703 --> 02:52.398
Hiya, Tex.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.668
Hiya, dude. The boys're
telling me you're going home.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.675
Yep. Catching tomorrow's boat.

02:57.777 --> 03:00.245
Well, there's no use in wishing
you luck. I guess you've had plenty.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.678
Give me Michigan Avenue
on a hot afternoon...

03:02.782 --> 03:04.977
and you can have all the yellow
dust this side of Seattle.

03:05.084 --> 03:07.746
I guess we all feel the same way, kid.

03:07.853 --> 03:11.152
It seems that all the homesick
guys in the world came up here.

03:11.257 --> 03:15.159
- Put this away for me. It's wearing me down.
- Sure thing.

03:46.492 --> 03:50.724
- Ah, they been kinda running
against you. - Yeah- Oh, thanks.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.731
Give us a couple more stacks. Here's where
I'm apt to earn my fare back to Seattle.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.801
There you are.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.210
Did I say Seattle?

04:06.312 --> 04:09.213
<i>You'd better quit while you still have
the price of a pick and shovel, dude.</i>

04:09.315 --> 04:12.216
What's the matter? You want your grave
dug? Give us some action! I'm buying!

04:17.723 --> 04:20.123
Well, the hot seat went cold, eh?

04:20.226 --> 04:22.125
<i>Better luck next time, dude.</i>

04:22.228 --> 04:25.026
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.
Well, so long, fellas.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.099
- So long.
- So long, dude.

04:37.510 --> 04:41.344
Russ, my stomach wants
to know how my credit is.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.348
Well, if your stomach's as good as
your credit, you'll live to be 100.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.351
Thanks. Did I ever tell you about
my grandpa? Died when he was 106.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.353
- What interrupted his youth?
- He quit drinking.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.356
So they cleaned you out, eh?

04:52.458 --> 04:55.791
- That's tough.
- Ah, there's a lot more where that came from.

05:10.142 --> 05:13.373
What's the matter, Mr. Thornton? Ain't you
speakin' to your pals since you got rich?

05:13.479 --> 05:15.879
Well, hello, Shorty! How are ya?

05:15.981 --> 05:17.881
- Have a stimulant.
- Thanks.

05:17.983 --> 05:20.178
- When'd you get out?
- This afternoon.

05:22.121 --> 05:25.818
These bastilles up here ain't as cozy as
them stirs down in little ol' New York.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.826
The finest jailhouse I ever seen
was the Coney Island precinct.

05:28.928 --> 05:32.159
- They sent you up for opening the mails, didn't they?
- Shh! Shh!

05:32.264 --> 05:34.459
That was a miscarriage of justice.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.967
Listen-Ah!

05:37.069 --> 05:40.971
All I did on that mail route was peek
in a couple of those bill o' dues.

05:41.073 --> 05:43.473
It gets darned lonesome
on the trail there.

05:43.576 --> 05:46.511
I was as innocent-like as if I was
sittin' in the New York Public Library.

05:46.612 --> 05:49.012
Letters are supposed to
be private, even up here.

05:49.115 --> 05:52.016
Well, if I wasn't honest trying to
seal it up, I wouldn't have got caught.

05:52.118 --> 05:55.679
- That's too bad.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

05:55.788 --> 05:59.189
- That letter I opened was very interesting.
- Yeah?

05:59.291 --> 06:02.624
Yeah. If you'd have saved a bit of your
bankroll, I'd have cut you in on somethin'.

06:02.728 --> 06:05.925
- Oh. More mail?
- Yes and no.

06:06.031 --> 06:09.489
That letter I opened was
worth about a million bucks.

06:10.669 --> 06:13.763
Thanks very much for the snort-ola.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.274
Ah! See ya around sometime.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.464
Hey, Shorty! Shorty! Wait a minute.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.132
Let me hear a little more
about that pipe dream of yours.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.228
Pipe dream is right.

06:47.339 --> 06:50.240
I been dreamin' about this for six
months up in that cold Arctic can.

06:50.342 --> 06:53.243
- Yeah? What do you need
a bankroll for? - Well, I-

06:53.345 --> 06:56.246
Hey, youse guys! Get outta here!

06:56.348 --> 06:58.578
23 skiddoo!

06:58.684 --> 07:00.914
Boo!

07:01.020 --> 07:04.080
I need a bankroll to grubstake
us as far as Dawson City...

07:04.190 --> 07:06.090
and then a long way beyond that.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.092
- Yeah? That sounds interesting.
- You know somethin'?

07:08.194 --> 07:10.594
When they caught me
opening those letters...

07:10.696 --> 07:13.096
and the judge presented
me with six months-

07:13.199 --> 07:15.599
or, as the English jockeys
say, a dozen fortnights-

07:15.701 --> 07:19.102
well, that judge asked me a lot of silly
questions, like how many letters I'd jimmied...

07:19.205 --> 07:21.105
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

07:21.207 --> 07:24.108
- But there's one question he didn't ask me.
- Yeah?

07:24.210 --> 07:27.111
<i>He didn't ask me what
was in that letter.</i>

07:27.213 --> 07:30.114
- Say, is your credit still good in there?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.411
- Come on. Let's go and exhaust it.
- Okay.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.976
His name was Blake. Martin Blake.

07:36.088 --> 07:39.489
He had red whiskers and,
well, he was a little blind.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.787
Oh, yeah, I remember. He was cracked.

07:41.894 --> 07:44.794
- Told everybody he'd found a rich lode.
- That's the guy.

07:44.897 --> 07:49.129
Well, he got sick on the trail. He was
coming to Dawson City to file his claim.

07:49.235 --> 07:52.932
He wrote a letter to his son,
John Blake, in San Francisco.

07:53.038 --> 07:55.939
He had a note on the envelope
- said if anything happened to him...

07:56.041 --> 07:57.941
the letter should be mailed.

07:58.043 --> 08:01.604
Well, his number was up,
so the letter was mailed.

08:01.714 --> 08:04.842
And you looked inside to be sure
everything was neat and in order.

08:04.950 --> 08:07.248
Mmm. But there wasn't
much of a letter.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.253
It was mostly a map.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.255
You made a copy?

08:11.357 --> 08:15.259
As I'm coming to the backstretch with a pencil,
I feel the long arm of John Law on my shoulder.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.761
- Did they take the copy away from you?
- No.

08:17.863 --> 08:19.763
- Then you still have it?
- No again.

08:19.865 --> 08:21.765
Well, what'd you do with it?

08:21.867 --> 08:24.927
I et it.

08:25.037 --> 08:28.438
When that map started to digest
though, see, it sorta went to my head.

08:28.540 --> 08:30.440
Went to my brain.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.942
So, while I'm sitting up
there in the booby hatch...

08:33.044 --> 08:35.878
I made a copy of it from memory.

08:35.981 --> 08:37.948
Take off my boot.

08:41.553 --> 08:44.454
Well, I'll show you. I
got a good memory too.

08:44.556 --> 08:48.219
Course, there's a couple of things
here I don't quite figure out.

08:48.327 --> 08:51.319
Now, you see...

08:51.430 --> 08:55.161
I don't know if this is
a mountain or a river.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.861
And I think they said
there was rapids here.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.871
But I don't see how that could be,
because I don't remember no river up there.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.806
Hey, listen, little man, the graveyards
up here is full of gold hopheads...

09:03.909 --> 09:06.309
guys that smoked a pipeful of hope...

09:06.412 --> 09:09.848
had glittering yellow dreams and ended
up under a pile of rocks in frozen ground.

09:09.949 --> 09:12.281
Me, I'll take bourbon.

09:12.384 --> 09:14.784
Kills you slower, but a
lot more pleasant-like.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.515
Now, wait a minute, Mr. Thornton.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.614
Something mighty
strange happened today.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.625
- Something mighty strange.
- Yeah?

09:21.727 --> 09:24.127
Sit down.

09:24.229 --> 09:27.460
I'm standin' out in front
of the Palace Hotel, see.

09:27.566 --> 09:31.866
Not doin' nothin', because, well, you know,
a fella just out of the can and broke...

09:31.971 --> 09:35.065
just lookin' and standin' is
about the limit of your activities.

09:35.174 --> 09:37.608
- Yeah.
- Well, it was a good idea, see.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.611
- 'Cause things started happenin'.
- Yeah?

09:40.713 --> 09:45.616
Out of this hotel comes the most beautiful
skirt that you ever put your peepers on.

09:45.718 --> 09:48.118
And following her is a
dignified-lookin' guy-

09:48.220 --> 09:51.121
I'd say 46 autumns.

09:51.223 --> 09:56.024
And him and her get in the sled and
they go off, headed for Dawson City.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.722
- Thanks for the society note.
- Yeah, but wait.

09:58.831 --> 10:02.289
I get excited, see, I run into the
hotel and take a look at the ledger.

10:02.401 --> 10:05.302
You know the names of these
two interesting people?

10:05.404 --> 10:09.670
Mr. and Mrs. John
Blake of San Francisco.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.675
Old man Blake's son?

10:11.777 --> 10:14.678
I hope, in my subtle way,
I've made myself clear.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.680
You have.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.548
Look, if I get the money for
an outfit, how do we split?

10:20.652 --> 10:22.552
Even-steven.

10:22.654 --> 10:24.554
Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back.

10:24.656 --> 10:26.556
Listen, they got a day's lead on us.

10:26.658 --> 10:29.559
- It's only a gamble.
- That's what I like about it.

10:29.661 --> 10:32.630
Hot-

10:38.804 --> 10:40.704
What's the matter with this fido?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.706
Sorry, Jack, but that one's taken.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.208
Belongs to a team I sold yesterday.

10:45.310 --> 10:48.746
I'll tell you what. I got a big fella
I'll give you for practically nothin'.

10:48.847 --> 10:50.815
Fifty bucks!

10:54.586 --> 10:56.486
What's the matter with him?

10:56.588 --> 11:00.149
- He ain't broke yet, and I don't think he's gonna be.
- Oh. Tough, huh?

11:05.531 --> 11:07.556
St. Bernard. He's all animal, Joe.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.998
- He's on a hunger strike.
- Won't eat anything?

11:10.102 --> 11:12.662
Nothin' but your hand or
your foot, or points north.

11:12.771 --> 11:16.298
- He looks like he was stolen
from some joint in the States.

11:16.408 --> 11:19.070
I never ask a dog no questions.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.670
<i>- Blue ribbons don't mean
nothin' to a pooch up here.</i>

11:33.025 --> 11:35.926
- How'd you like to see me make this guy eat?
- All right by me.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.929
- I ain't got nothin' to do all winter.
- Get some grub.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.990
- Frank, dinner for one!
- Unharness Little Boy Blue. Put him right there.

11:45.938 --> 11:48.907
- Dinner for one.
- Okay. Let him out.

11:50.742 --> 11:54.371
- I hope you know what you're doin'.
- I hope so too!

12:00.085 --> 12:02.110
All right, let go of him.

12:04.723 --> 12:07.123
All right, pull your dog out!

12:16.001 --> 12:18.970
Don't let your dog get this piece.

12:32.584 --> 12:34.484
He'll eat regular from now on.

12:34.586 --> 12:37.578
I wish I had time to break
him. He'd make a great dog.

12:37.689 --> 12:40.658
- All right, Frank, put him back.
- I'll do it. Here.

12:45.964 --> 12:48.895
<i>Which one of you is Mr. Groggins?</i>

12:50.702 --> 12:52.897
<i>Well, speak up. Is Mr. Groggins here?</i>

12:54.006 --> 12:55.906
My name is Smith.

12:56.008 --> 12:59.034
Are the outfit and provisions
ready that were ordered in my name?

13:02.447 --> 13:06.440
Well, why don't you answer me,
Groggins? You speak English, don't you?

13:06.552 --> 13:10.545
Uh, y-yes, sir. H-
Here's your whole outfit.

13:12.391 --> 13:15.417
- Tenderfoot, huh?
- Not as tender as he looks.

13:15.527 --> 13:18.428
If I'm not too inquisitive,
will six dogs be enough?

13:18.530 --> 13:21.499
- They'll pull the load, all right.
- With me on it?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.568
Well, I don't know about that.

13:23.669 --> 13:27.628
You don't look like a man who knows
much about anything, Mr. Groggins.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.640
<i>Well, I do know...</i>

13:30.742 --> 13:34.007
that people come up here don't
usually make a buggy ride out of it.

13:34.112 --> 13:37.707
They walk or run with the
dogs, sometimes break trail.

13:37.816 --> 13:41.775
You sure will need more dogs
if you're gonna ride that sled.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.787
And more dog food.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.789
And a needle and thread.

13:46.925 --> 13:49.257
What for, my intelligent friend?

13:49.361 --> 13:53.661
To sew up the guys that's gonna
split their sides laughin' at ya!

13:53.765 --> 13:57.223
Once in a while people do laugh at me.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.664
But very briefly.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.438
Well, sir, dogs! Dogs!

14:05.544 --> 14:08.104
Uh, bring Flip and Frowsy.

14:08.213 --> 14:12.343
Say, Joe, why don't you show the
honorable Mr. Smith this beautiful animal?

14:15.454 --> 14:17.820
I don't think so. He's too savage.

14:17.923 --> 14:20.483
Is that so? Well, just let him out.

14:20.592 --> 14:23.823
- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith.
- Let him out, I said.

14:23.929 --> 14:26.523
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.930
I don't like to take the
responsibility, Mr. Smith.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.434
That's why you'll
never amount to much.

14:31.536 --> 14:33.436
What are you asking for him?

14:33.538 --> 14:35.438
Uh, 250 bucks.

14:35.540 --> 14:38.338
Sold. Let him out.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.709
So your name's Buck, eh?

14:48.820 --> 14:50.845
You're tough, huh?

14:54.826 --> 14:57.818
Hey, wait a minute. That
dog cost me a lot of money.

14:57.929 --> 15:00.830
- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins.
- Wait a minute.

15:00.932 --> 15:02.763
That dog belongs to me.

15:02.868 --> 15:07.771
I bought him, Smith, and I
don't allow my dogs to be shot.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.774
That is, of course,
unless I shoot them myself.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.538
That's all right. I'll give
you twice what you paid for him.

15:13.645 --> 15:15.875
He's not for sale.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.345
Just as you say, my good man.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.716
Just as you say.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.056
Well, what others have you?

15:26.158 --> 15:28.058
- Uh, here. Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.358
I ordered a collapsible bathtub
from Seattle. Did it get here?

15:33.865 --> 15:35.765
<i>It's a bathtub.!</i>

15:35.867 --> 15:37.732
<i>It's a bathtub.!</i>

15:39.171 --> 15:43.107
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.176
Easy with ye.

15:46.511 --> 15:49.173
Come on. Out.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.079
Come on. Come on. Come on, Harmon.

15:53.518 --> 15:55.418
Here ya are, Mr. Smith.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.421
We thought it was
something to pile wood in.

15:58.523 --> 16:01.856
The only bath a person gets up
here is by the sweat of the brow.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.520
How interesting. Mush!

16:08.934 --> 16:10.993
Been a great pleasure, gentlemen.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.071
A great pleasure!

16:14.840 --> 16:16.740
Nice guys.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.743
Well, I don't like to
see a dog killed either.

16:19.845 --> 16:22.746
But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.749
All right, I told you
I'm buying him, and I am.

16:25.851 --> 16:28.752
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
- Quiet, quiet.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.822
Whose money is this?

16:35.861 --> 16:39.820
Listen, you, you're my
dog, and I'm your boss.

16:39.931 --> 16:43.264
The sooner you learn that, the easier
it's going to be for both of us.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.521
<i>Come on.! Mush.! Mush.!</i>

17:13.632 --> 17:16.964
Ho! Ho!

17:17.068 --> 17:19.468
Right there!

17:19.570 --> 17:22.199
Hey!

17:22.307 --> 17:26.367
Go on! Get back there! What'd
you bring this baboon along for?

17:26.478 --> 17:29.970
<i>- That big guy don't like him.!
- That's just too bad! He'll learn to like him!</i>

17:30.081 --> 17:33.278
<i>- Come on! Let's go! Mush! Mush!
- Get your teeth out of him.!</i>

17:33.385 --> 17:36.013
Come on! Get up there!
Come on, gray boy!

17:42.427 --> 17:44.657
Come on, Buck.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.527
- What's the matter?
- Nearly took my wing off.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.626
Come on, big boy.

17:50.735 --> 17:52.635
We don't mean you any harm.

17:52.737 --> 17:55.228
We're trying to be friendly with you.

18:00.645 --> 18:02.510
Buck, come here!

18:02.614 --> 18:04.707
<i>Buck, come here.!</i>

18:08.987 --> 18:11.421
Come on, boy. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.826
Come on, now, be-

18:16.595 --> 18:20.326
Buck! Hey, Buck! Buck, come here!

18:26.705 --> 18:29.606
Well, you can kiss
that 250 bucks good-bye.

18:29.708 --> 18:32.609
Yep. It's too bad too.
He'd have made a great dog.

18:32.711 --> 18:36.169
Now he'll either freeze to death,
or wolves'll get him. Poor fella.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.394
Make yourself at home, Buck.

19:39.844 --> 19:41.937
Hey! Look, boss! Wolves!

20:18.216 --> 20:20.184
<i>Is he dead?</i>

20:22.887 --> 20:26.220
No, he isn't dead. And he isn't a he.

20:29.294 --> 20:32.195
Hey, you know who that
is? That's Blake's woman!

20:34.966 --> 20:38.868
Oh, John! Oh, John
darling! I'm so glad!

20:38.970 --> 20:40.938
Oh.

20:44.876 --> 20:48.039
Oh- Oh,
I thought-

20:49.481 --> 20:52.644
Is my husband with
you? Have you found him?

20:52.751 --> 20:55.720
<i>You're the only one
we've found so far.</i>

20:58.757 --> 21:01.658
What about your husband?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.591
I don't know.

21:03.695 --> 21:05.595
We ran into trouble...

21:05.697 --> 21:08.598
and we lost most of our
provisions crossing the river.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.863
The ice broke, and
- and then some of our dogs died.

21:11.970 --> 21:15.030
Two days ago my husband
went out to look for food...

21:15.140 --> 21:17.233
and he hasn't come back.

21:20.145 --> 21:22.113
Do you think he's dead?

21:23.381 --> 21:25.349
That's a pretty good guess.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.529
What are we gonna do with her?

21:39.631 --> 21:42.600
What can you do? Take her
to Dawson and leave her.

21:43.668 --> 21:45.727
You're forgetting one thing, pal.

21:45.837 --> 21:49.068
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.

21:49.174 --> 21:52.143
And they had the map
- the original one.

21:55.947 --> 21:58.848
You'll find my husband
for me, won't you?

21:58.950 --> 22:01.851
There's nothing we can do. We're
a thousand miles from nowhere.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.285
Either the cold got
him, or the wolves.

22:04.389 --> 22:08.792
- Get on the sled. We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.

22:08.893 --> 22:11.487
He isn't dead. I
- I don't believe that.

22:11.596 --> 22:16.431
Hey, listen, lady, in this country when
a guy is gone for two days, he's gone.

22:18.570 --> 22:21.971
I refuse to go until I
definitely know about my husband.

22:22.073 --> 22:25.270
If you don't wanna stay and look
for him, you can go without me.

22:31.716 --> 22:34.344
No! No! Put me down!

22:34.452 --> 22:38.411
Put me down! I can't go!
I've got to stay! Put me down!

22:40.892 --> 22:42.917
Stop! Stop this sled!

22:43.027 --> 22:44.927
Whoa! What's the matter?

22:45.029 --> 22:47.930
- You untie these straps.
- Oh, no, no. You might fall off.

22:48.032 --> 22:50.432
I'm doing this for your own
good. Later on you'll thank me.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.935
I hate you, you beast!
Let me out of here!

22:53.037 --> 22:56.165
Sticks and stones may break my
bones, but words can never hurt me!

22:56.274 --> 22:58.708
Whoops! Ha!

22:58.810 --> 23:00.778
<i>- Let's go! Mush!
- Mush.!</i>

23:24.068 --> 23:26.036
Beans.

23:35.246 --> 23:39.148
It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for
everybody to pitch in and do their share.

23:39.250 --> 23:43.152
<i>You've been with us two days, and you haven't
done anything but sit around and look nasty.</i>

23:43.254 --> 23:45.154
<i>Can you cook?</i>

23:45.256 --> 23:47.190
Yes, I'm considered
a very excellent cook.

23:47.292 --> 23:51.023
Huh. Well, how about giving these
beans the benefit of your talents?

23:51.129 --> 23:53.029
I'll do nothing to help you.

23:53.131 --> 23:56.225
I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to
want me with you, you'll take care of me.

23:56.334 --> 24:00.794
Want you? We just had an attack of insanity
and decided to keep you from committing suicide.

24:00.905 --> 24:02.930
Very bad idea, come to think of it.

24:11.716 --> 24:14.844
Hey! You're forgettin'
our guest of honor.

24:18.122 --> 24:20.022
Thank you, Mr. Hoolihan.

24:20.124 --> 24:22.786
- Hey. Gimme. Come on, gimme.
- Hmm?

24:28.900 --> 24:31.801
Say, uh, Mrs. Blake, if
I ain't too inquisitive...

24:31.903 --> 24:34.804
what was you and your
old man gonna do up here?

24:34.906 --> 24:36.771
Work.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.275
Oh. Looking for the yellow stuff, eh?

24:39.377 --> 24:41.277
Probably.

24:41.379 --> 24:44.109
Can't understand it, a guy taking
his wife way out in the wilderness.

24:44.215 --> 24:46.740
Stupid, if you ask me.

24:46.851 --> 24:48.751
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.

24:48.853 --> 24:50.753
Yeah?

24:50.855 --> 24:53.756
Yeah. He loved me and I loved him.

24:53.858 --> 24:56.759
Well, I wouldn't let him go alone.

24:56.861 --> 25:00.092
Undoubtedly, that will still impress
you as being a very stupid reason.

25:00.198 --> 25:02.098
We thought it an excellent one.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.259
I still think it's stupid.

25:06.437 --> 25:09.406
<i>Have some coffee.
It might warm you up.</i>

25:15.680 --> 25:17.671
Well, tell me somethin'.

25:17.782 --> 25:21.684
Uh, didn't he have some object?
Wasn't there somethin' he was after?

25:21.786 --> 25:25.381
What I mean is, did he have a hunch,
or did somebody give him a tip?

25:25.490 --> 25:29.392
- I'm very tired, Mr. Hoolihan, and I know you must be.
- Me, tired? Heck no!

25:29.494 --> 25:32.930
Well, I thought you might be,
asking such personal questions.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.226
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:46.110 --> 25:48.408
Boss, she's a woman in a million.

25:48.513 --> 25:51.414
- You think so?
- Yeah. She don't talk.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.484
Oh!

26:01.292 --> 26:03.283
All right, get on with the dogs.

26:03.394 --> 26:06.454
No, thank you. I'll
cross the way you men do.

26:52.510 --> 26:55.911
Hold on! Hold on!

26:56.014 --> 26:57.982
<i>Stick with it.!</i>

27:24.909 --> 27:27.776
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!

28:28.306 --> 28:31.207
Say! Nice, modest little
prices they have here.

28:31.309 --> 28:33.209
They practically give things away.

28:33.311 --> 28:36.212
Say, boss, how much we
got this side of the grave?

28:36.314 --> 28:39.010
Just about enough for
a room in a poorhouse.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.381
This mansion over here'll do. Come on.

28:41.486 --> 28:44.683
- Come on, Buck.
- Come on, Buck.

29:06.511 --> 29:09.912
Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's
about time to say good-bye.

29:11.682 --> 29:14.583
There's an officer of the
Mounted Police down the street.

29:14.685 --> 29:16.676
They'll get you back to the States.

29:16.787 --> 29:19.688
We'd stake you ourselves, only,
well, we've mislaid our funds.

29:19.790 --> 29:22.190
Yeah, yeah.

29:22.293 --> 29:24.727
Well, you've been very
nice, Mr. Thornton.

29:24.829 --> 29:27.730
I
- I suppose I was a little difficult, but...

29:27.832 --> 29:30.733
<i>- well, losing someone you've
grown to love isn't- - Yes, I know.</i>

29:30.835 --> 29:33.201
I'm sorry I was so rough.

29:39.143 --> 29:41.873
Well, I
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.

29:41.979 --> 29:45.142
Mmm. I'm sorry that I can't think
of a thing to be sorry about.

29:45.249 --> 29:47.012
Ohh!

29:47.118 --> 29:50.019
I suppose you've got friends
and relatives back in the states.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.180
No. My husband's all I had.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.191
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.193
Yes?

29:57.295 --> 30:00.696
We know what brought you up
here. We've known all along.

30:00.798 --> 30:03.790
I mean, old man Blake's claim.

30:03.901 --> 30:06.802
But how? How could you possibly know?

30:06.904 --> 30:08.804
Give me that map, Shorty.

30:08.906 --> 30:10.806
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:10.908 --> 30:12.808
Did you ever see this?

30:12.910 --> 30:14.878
Or, uh, something like it?

30:16.914 --> 30:20.145
Yes. Yes, I've seen the original.

30:20.251 --> 30:22.651
This won't do you any
good. It isn't correct.

30:22.753 --> 30:25.313
I know it. That's why I
was going to suggest that-

30:25.423 --> 30:28.153
My husband had to borrow
and beg to make this trip.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.659
He went through all sorts
of horrible difficulties and-

30:30.761 --> 30:33.662
I know. Well, now he
- he's gone.

30:33.764 --> 30:36.164
That's why I was
going to suggest that-

30:36.267 --> 30:39.168
And you were gonna take
it away from him, steal it.

30:39.270 --> 30:43.604
Oh, now, please be reasonable. Why don't
you come in with me and Shorty on this thing?

30:43.708 --> 30:46.609
Where our map is incorrect, give us
the right route. We'll be partners.

30:46.711 --> 30:49.077
And, well, while you're about it...

30:49.180 --> 30:52.081
I suppose you may as
well consider all angles.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.083
We need your information about this.

30:54.185 --> 30:58.315
We could probably find the mine ourselves
without your help. It would take longer.

30:58.422 --> 31:00.686
Of course, you don't
know us very well...

31:00.791 --> 31:03.624
except that we're a
little rough on women.

31:03.728 --> 31:05.628
We might play you dirty.

31:05.730 --> 31:09.632
We might take your information and then
tell you to, well, go jump in the river.

31:09.734 --> 31:11.702
<i>We might do that.</i>

31:13.170 --> 31:16.139
On the other hand, we might
be on the up-and-up with you.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.148
Let me see your map.

31:27.318 --> 31:30.219
This river here
- it isn't a river, it's a dry creek.

31:30.321 --> 31:33.222
- And that mountain peak, that's down here.
- Criminy! That's it!

31:33.324 --> 31:35.224
Ha!

31:35.326 --> 31:37.624
All the other mistakes are minor ones.

31:37.728 --> 31:40.288
All right, Mr. Thornton,
now you can tell me-

31:40.398 --> 31:43.299
How did you express it?
To go jump in the river?

31:43.401 --> 31:46.302
We've gotta do a lot of jumping ourselves
to get the 700 bucks for the outfit.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.305
- Seven hundred dollars is hard to get.
- My, oh, my, oh, my.

31:49.407 --> 31:53.309
But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife,
stick somebody and take it away from 'em.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.743
- Yeah!
- Come on, Shorty. Mush!

32:00.117 --> 32:02.381
- Come on. Let's go.
- All set.

32:02.486 --> 32:04.886
Keep your fingers
crossed till we get back.

32:08.592 --> 32:10.719
We've gotta make a touch, Shorty.

32:10.828 --> 32:13.729
Something that means more to
me now that just finding a mine.

32:13.831 --> 32:15.731
Yeah, I been noticing that.

32:15.833 --> 32:18.063
You're the doctor. You
know what's good for ya.

32:18.169 --> 32:21.070
The way I figures it, hunting
for gold's a full-time job.

32:21.172 --> 32:24.073
Anything that interferes
with it, interferes with it.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.735
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

32:26.844 --> 32:30.211
Mind keeping that fat snoot
of yours out of my affairs?

32:30.314 --> 32:33.078
All right, all right. No offense,
boss. No offense whatsoever.

32:40.358 --> 32:42.258
- Where's Buck?
- Hmm?

32:42.360 --> 32:44.328
Come on!

33:04.648 --> 33:06.912
My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!

33:08.619 --> 33:10.519
Can't you see that's poisoned meat?

33:10.621 --> 33:12.714
That's the second
time he's attacked me!

33:12.823 --> 33:14.984
Yeah, he's crazy about you!

33:15.092 --> 33:16.787
Can't you see?

33:16.894 --> 33:19.886
Wait a minute, partner. I'll give
you a chance to make some money.

33:19.997 --> 33:22.761
- I doubt it.
- I'll give you $300 for him.

33:22.867 --> 33:24.994
<i>- Ha.!
- Five hundred.</i>

33:25.102 --> 33:27.093
Nope. Not interested.

33:27.204 --> 33:29.934
I'll give you $1,000!

33:34.178 --> 33:37.807
That's a fabulous price to pay for a
dog. I could get a team of six for that.

33:37.915 --> 33:40.406
What do you expect you'd do
with him if I let you have him?

33:40.518 --> 33:44.477
Give myself the exquisite pleasure
of putting a bullet through his head.

33:44.588 --> 33:46.749
Yeah, that's what I thought.

33:46.857 --> 33:50.850
No, thanks. I'm sorry I can't
contribute to your fun, mister.

33:50.961 --> 33:53.987
Boo!

33:56.967 --> 33:59.094
<i>What'll you have to drink, gentlemen?</i>

34:00.404 --> 34:03.532
Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks?

34:03.641 --> 34:06.542
Hello, Sam! How are you? Glad
to see you. Sam, this is Shorty.

34:06.644 --> 34:08.543
- Hello.
- Ah, yes!

34:08.646 --> 34:11.547
Just seen the argument you had
with that fellow back there.

34:11.649 --> 34:14.049
- He doesn't seem to like your dog.
- No, no.

34:14.150 --> 34:17.052
The dog doesn't like him either.

34:17.154 --> 34:19.554
Look, Sam, how you fixed?

34:19.657 --> 34:22.353
Uh, pretty nearly flat.

34:22.460 --> 34:26.987
But anyhow, I got enough to ask you
gentlemens to join me in a drink.

34:27.097 --> 34:28.996
- Bourbon, straight!
- Ditto!

34:29.099 --> 34:31.498
Likewise! Come on, boy! Come on!

34:31.601 --> 34:34.469
Schnapps?

34:34.572 --> 34:37.768
Well, Sam, here's to
your very good health.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.469
- Skoal.
- Prosit.

34:40.578 --> 34:44.947
You know, that's a lot of money
that fellow offered you for your dog.

34:45.049 --> 34:47.516
Yeah? That's a lot of dog too.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.518
<i>Ja!</i>

34:57.928 --> 35:01.830
- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?
- No, no, no, not yet.

35:01.932 --> 35:04.264
Maybe somebody we know will show.

35:04.368 --> 35:07.860
Ole! Ha-ha! How are you?

35:07.972 --> 35:09.872
I got lots trouble.

35:09.974 --> 35:12.875
Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap.

35:12.977 --> 35:14.877
What matter, huh?

35:14.979 --> 35:17.504
I got load of thousand-pound flour...

35:17.615 --> 35:20.743
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.

35:20.851 --> 35:23.820
Two of my dogs, they die.

35:23.921 --> 35:27.914
It's too big load for the
other four dogs to pull.

35:28.025 --> 35:30.926
Quiet, now!

35:31.028 --> 35:34.429
Yo! That's one fine dog, mister!

35:34.532 --> 35:36.523
You want to sell, maybe?

35:36.634 --> 35:39.125
- No, I don't.
- I'll say he don't!

35:39.236 --> 35:41.466
You know, that fellow back there...

35:41.572 --> 35:44.564
<i>just offered him 1,000 bucks.</i>

35:44.675 --> 35:47.576
- One thousand
bucks? - Mm-hmm.

35:47.678 --> 35:50.579
What the dog do? Spit gold dust?

35:50.681 --> 35:52.581
He's the best dog you've ever seen.

35:52.683 --> 35:55.584
He could pull that load of
yours without any help at all.

35:55.686 --> 35:58.621
- Sure! I'll bet you he could.
- Well, he could.

35:58.722 --> 36:01.691
How'd you like to make a
little bet on that, partner?

36:03.327 --> 36:05.261
Haven't any money to bet.

36:05.362 --> 36:07.762
I hear of one dog in Nome...

36:07.865 --> 36:09.992
he pull 800 pound.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.762
But he dies dead to do that.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.270
Ah, no dog can pull 1,000
pounds. It's impossible.

36:15.372 --> 36:17.806
Well, then it's
impossible. Let's drop it.

36:17.908 --> 36:19.967
Is it all right to
look at him, mister?

36:20.077 --> 36:22.978
It ain't every day we can see a
dog that can pull a thousand pounds.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.173
Come on, boss. Let's get outta here.

36:25.282 --> 36:28.649
What's the matter, gentlemen?

36:30.287 --> 36:32.187
If I overheard correctly...

36:32.289 --> 36:36.487
the argument is whether or not
this dog can pull a thousand pounds.

36:36.594 --> 36:39.495
I'm willing to bet a
dollar a pound he can't.

36:39.597 --> 36:41.758
He won't bet. Says he's broke.

36:41.865 --> 36:44.265
I don't want money
from you, my friend.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.666
If your dog is able to do
it, I'll give you the $1,000.

36:48.772 --> 36:51.206
<i>- If he
can't- - Well?</i>

36:52.610 --> 36:56.171
Why, then, I'll take the dog.

36:58.782 --> 37:00.682
No.

37:00.784 --> 37:02.615
<i>Say, that sounds fair to me.</i>

37:02.720 --> 37:07.123
<i>Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog
that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds.</i>

37:07.224 --> 37:10.125
<i>- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!</i>

37:10.227 --> 37:13.628
<i>First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.</i>

37:13.731 --> 37:17.292
Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem
to think I'm giving you the best of it.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.303
Don't do it, boss.
Let's go outta here.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.600
A thousand dollars.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.318
It's a bet!

37:36.420 --> 37:39.821
It's a bet!

37:39.923 --> 37:42.824
I think you make one
big mistake, mister.

37:42.926 --> 37:45.394
But, well, we go outside.

37:53.837 --> 37:57.967
- Thornton's crazy!
- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!

37:58.075 --> 38:00.771
- Ten-to-one he
can't! - It's a bet!

38:00.878 --> 38:03.312
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!

38:03.414 --> 38:06.577
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!

38:06.684 --> 38:11.781
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!

38:23.267 --> 38:26.395
- Gee, boss, he can't do it. He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.

38:26.503 --> 38:28.733
You're not only doing this for money.

38:28.839 --> 38:32.036
You're afraid of getting stuck
here and losing that Blake woman.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.772
Oh, all right.

38:44.688 --> 38:48.454
Your dog is to pull the sled a
hundred yards from the standstill.

38:48.559 --> 38:50.618
That's the bet.

38:50.728 --> 38:52.628
<i>A hundred yards.!</i>

38:52.730 --> 38:54.664
All right, all right!

39:03.173 --> 39:05.607
One, two, three, four...

39:05.709 --> 39:09.110
<i>All right, get back.
Nobody touch that dog.</i>

39:09.213 --> 39:12.273
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, one, two-

39:13.584 --> 39:16.519
Dog is gonna draw a
sled. Just stand there.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.520
The dog will do it!

39:18.622 --> 39:21.352
It's plenty load for one dog to pull.

39:21.458 --> 39:23.585
The dog will do it!

39:23.694 --> 39:26.686
Five, six, seven, eight, nine-

39:26.797 --> 39:29.766
Keep your hands off that
dog, now! You understand?

39:31.135 --> 39:33.126
Oh, I beg your pardon.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.797
Seven, eight, nine, a hundred.

39:37.374 --> 39:39.672
Go on, mister. We're waiting.

39:44.114 --> 39:45.843
Buck.

39:45.949 --> 39:47.917
<i>Buck.!</i>

39:49.653 --> 39:53.384
Buck! Come on, boy!

39:58.262 --> 40:01.231
Come on, Buck! Mush!

40:22.419 --> 40:26.014
Come on, boy! Mush, Buck!

40:30.794 --> 40:33.092
Come on, come on, Buck!

40:49.713 --> 40:52.113
- Come on, boy.
- Stay away from that dog!

40:52.216 --> 40:54.116
Buck, come on!

41:02.392 --> 41:05.850
Buck! Come on, boy!

41:10.667 --> 41:12.897
Come on, whitey! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

41:36.193 --> 41:40.493
Hooray! That dog done it.

41:40.597 --> 41:43.930
- He all right?
- Hope so.

41:50.874 --> 41:53.866
Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but
haven't you forgotten about the money?

41:53.977 --> 41:56.207
The gelt? Please.

41:56.313 --> 41:58.338
Mmm! Thank you, sir.

41:58.448 --> 42:00.507
- Oh, say. You know something?
- Well?

42:00.617 --> 42:03.484
You'd make a good dog biscuit.

42:29.413 --> 42:31.472
- What's that, a halter?
- Yeah.

42:31.581 --> 42:35.415
Hmm. Being as I'm working like a
horse, I just as well look like one.

42:37.421 --> 42:40.322
There you are. Now hang on to this.

42:40.424 --> 42:42.324
Is that all?

42:42.426 --> 42:44.451
Did you remember nails?

42:44.561 --> 42:47.496
Nails. Hammers and saw. Look.

42:47.597 --> 42:50.498
You bought 'em yourself. What's
the matter with you this morning?

42:50.600 --> 42:52.568
- Nothing. Get out.
- Mmm.

42:52.669 --> 42:54.569
Oh, hey, listen-

42:54.671 --> 42:56.696
There's something we did forget
- a medicine kit.

42:56.807 --> 43:00.140
We need some iodine and
quinine, just in case.

43:00.243 --> 43:01.835
Yeah, all right. I'll get 'em.

43:01.945 --> 43:05.403
Hmm. I hope it won't be
too heavy for you to carry.

43:06.883 --> 43:09.579
<i>- See youse later.
- All right.</i>

43:13.056 --> 43:15.581
Say, uh, what do we need
the nails and hammers for?

43:17.561 --> 43:19.620
Well, the snow's disappearing fast.

43:19.730 --> 43:23.029
We'll have to cache the sled
later on and build a boat.

43:23.133 --> 43:25.897
Oh?

43:29.239 --> 43:31.901
Say, uh, look-

43:32.009 --> 43:34.170
Yeah?

43:34.277 --> 43:36.245
What is it?

43:37.948 --> 43:39.848
I, uh-

43:39.950 --> 43:42.919
I got something to tell you. Maybe
you better take it sitting down.

43:48.091 --> 43:50.082
You know how I feel about
women in this country.

43:50.193 --> 43:52.252
Where we're going is ten
times as tough and rugged...

43:52.362 --> 43:55.092
- as anything you've seen up to now.
- What are you getting at?

43:55.198 --> 43:57.189
Well, just this.

43:57.300 --> 43:59.291
I paid your room rent
here at the hotel...

43:59.403 --> 44:01.928
and I'll leave you enough money
for expenses until we get back.

44:02.039 --> 44:04.564
You mean I'm supposed to wait
here while you and Shorty go-

44:04.674 --> 44:06.938
That's it.

44:07.044 --> 44:09.945
I've been wondering whether
you'd try something like this.

44:10.047 --> 44:12.106
Well, if you're going, I'm going too.

44:12.215 --> 44:14.183
- You mean you don't trust us?
- I mean exactly that.

44:14.284 --> 44:16.479
All right, Shorty and I will
stay here. You go find the mine.

44:16.586 --> 44:18.554
- Oh, don't be smart.
- Well, you're not going.

44:18.655 --> 44:20.623
Wouldn't be fair to
you, or to us either.

44:20.724 --> 44:23.352
Slow us down to a walk and
make us carry double provisions.

44:23.460 --> 44:26.122
Besides, it's more of a risk
than I want to see you take.

44:26.229 --> 44:28.789
Believe me, that's my only
reason for making this decision.

44:28.899 --> 44:31.197
If you don't like my way
of doing it, do it yourself.

44:31.301 --> 44:34.031
- You can have my share.
- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?

44:34.137 --> 44:36.662
Well, thank you very much. You'll
not leave this town without me.

44:36.773 --> 44:38.673
We'll leave without you.

44:38.775 --> 44:41.642
You'll wait here and like it.

44:46.416 --> 44:49.010
All right, come on. Let's get going.

44:49.119 --> 44:52.816
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.

44:52.923 --> 44:56.484
If that female iceberg comes out and
wants to tag along, smack her down.

45:03.533 --> 45:06.559
Wonder what's happened now.

45:06.670 --> 45:09.696
Oh, well. You know, I know a couple of
people used to fool around like that...

45:09.806 --> 45:12.036
and they got children now.

45:20.717 --> 45:22.708
You, uh
- You still want to go along?

45:24.588 --> 45:27.318
<i>Not only do I still
want to go, I am going.</i>

45:31.728 --> 45:33.855
All right, come on. Let's get going.

45:33.964 --> 45:36.797
<i>Come on.!</i>

45:39.302 --> 45:42.237
Mush! Mush!

45:42.339 --> 45:44.239
<i>Come on.!</i>

45:44.341 --> 45:46.775
Hey! Hey! Come on!

45:52.282 --> 45:54.978
Mush! Mush!

45:55.085 --> 45:56.985
Mush!

46:05.695 --> 46:08.596
- What's up, Sergeant?
- They just brought a fellow in.

46:08.698 --> 46:11.098
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?

46:11.201 --> 46:13.533
It seems like he left his
sled to go hunting for food...

46:13.637 --> 46:15.571
then couldn't find his way back.

46:15.672 --> 46:17.606
He was almost a corpse
when they found him.

46:17.707 --> 46:20.437
- What's his name?
- Well, we found these on him.

46:20.544 --> 46:24.503
Name seems to be Blake
- John Blake, San Francisco.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.958
Here it comes.

46:46.069 --> 46:48.936
Say, it even looks like a raft.

46:49.039 --> 46:51.633
Thanks. I always
wanted to join the navy.

46:51.741 --> 46:53.732
- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?
- I'm afraid not, matey.

46:53.843 --> 46:56.277
- They'll have to run along the bank.
- Very well, sir.

46:56.379 --> 46:58.973
Be careful of that varnish
on the deck, you two gobs.

46:59.082 --> 47:00.982
Step right in, commodore.

47:02.385 --> 47:05.445
<i>All set? Shove off, cabin boy.</i>

47:05.555 --> 47:07.489
Ca-

47:07.591 --> 47:09.491
Toot, toot!

47:09.593 --> 47:11.561
Hard aport!

47:21.438 --> 47:23.804
Come on, Buck. Come on.

47:39.256 --> 47:42.054
The way I figure it, we
go 100 miles upstream...

47:42.158 --> 47:45.025
then we follow a creek
that runs into it north.

47:45.128 --> 47:47.961
Huh!

47:48.064 --> 47:50.225
Never fails.

47:50.333 --> 47:53.097
Oh, you pretty things.

47:53.203 --> 47:56.969
That's right
- north for about 40 miles.

47:57.073 --> 48:01.339
And then all we gotta do is-

48:03.680 --> 48:05.648
Oh, if you could only cook.

48:07.817 --> 48:09.717
Then all we have to
do is find the knoll...

48:09.819 --> 48:12.754
upon which stands a tree,
half-shattered by lightning.

48:12.856 --> 48:14.824
And the cabin.

48:27.437 --> 48:29.405
Near that knoll.

48:30.607 --> 48:32.575
Gee, I wonder what
it's gonna be like...

48:32.676 --> 48:34.644
having things instead
of wishing for 'em.

48:34.744 --> 48:36.644
Hmm.

48:36.746 --> 48:38.646
Not nearly so much fun.

48:40.784 --> 48:42.684
You're wrong, Claire.

48:42.786 --> 48:44.686
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.

48:44.788 --> 48:46.688
It's owning something that counts.

48:46.790 --> 48:49.953
Taking it when you can't get it any other way
- that's all right too.

48:52.162 --> 48:55.563
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.

48:55.665 --> 48:57.633
When there's something
you need, grab it.

48:57.734 --> 48:59.725
Take it away from the other guy.

48:59.836 --> 49:01.736
It's a good law.

49:01.838 --> 49:04.398
It works.

49:04.507 --> 49:09.706
Nope. It only works when you
deserve to have what you take.

49:09.813 --> 49:12.907
Otherwise it's stealing.

49:13.016 --> 49:16.543
Perhaps that particular
commandment isn't respected up here.

49:18.188 --> 49:22.352
<i>They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.</i>

49:22.459 --> 49:24.427
Well, Noah...

49:24.527 --> 49:27.690
that boat manipulating's a little too
tough for my delicate constitution...

49:27.797 --> 49:31.392
so if you don't mind,
sir, I shall go below.

49:38.041 --> 49:39.941
Good night.

49:40.043 --> 49:42.375
- Night, Shorty.
- Night.

49:42.479 --> 49:44.447
Good night, dice.

50:01.831 --> 50:04.459
Summer's just around the corner.

50:04.567 --> 50:07.229
I can smell it.

50:09.572 --> 50:12.803
You know, somehow
Dawson and Skagway and...

50:12.909 --> 50:16.037
even California seem like
places I've just heard of.

50:18.248 --> 50:21.649
Seems as if I've lived out
here in this wilderness forever.

50:23.620 --> 50:26.783
Other people and other places...

50:26.890 --> 50:29.085
never existed.

50:43.273 --> 50:45.741
But there's one thing I do remember...

50:47.444 --> 50:50.470
and that's a very
kind and wonderful man.

50:59.456 --> 51:02.755
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.

51:02.859 --> 51:04.827
What are you thinking of, Buck?

51:06.563 --> 51:10.294
Well, he's probably
remembering more than thinking.

51:10.400 --> 51:14.200
Remembering back to the time
when he was more wolf than dog.

51:15.805 --> 51:18.137
When there was only one law-

51:19.242 --> 51:22.473
the law we were just talking about.

51:26.716 --> 51:28.684
It's getting late, Jack.

51:28.785 --> 51:31.049
Think I'll say good night.

52:02.886 --> 52:05.218
Not guilty, Your Honor.

52:30.246 --> 52:32.146
Cabin!

52:32.248 --> 52:34.910
- The tree!
- The mine!

52:35.018 --> 52:36.986
Oh, boy!

52:48.898 --> 52:51.526
Hey, somebody pinch me.

52:51.634 --> 52:53.625
That does it.

52:53.736 --> 52:56.899
It's just as it was in the letter.

53:03.179 --> 53:05.477
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.

53:05.582 --> 53:07.482
Hey! Hey, boss!

53:07.584 --> 53:10.075
Boss! Come here, quick.

53:10.186 --> 53:12.450
Hmm. Look at this.

53:12.555 --> 53:15.115
Oh, my. Oh.

53:15.224 --> 53:18.489
Lookit, lookit! Tell me
if I'm dreamin'. Lookit.

53:20.897 --> 53:22.956
Holy mackerel.

53:23.066 --> 53:27.469
It's gold, Claire. More gold than
I've ever seen in my whole life.

53:29.238 --> 53:31.138
Oh!

53:31.240 --> 53:33.708
Oh, be careful!

53:54.263 --> 53:56.595
Hey, if we panned this
much in an afternoon...

53:56.699 --> 53:58.667
think what we'll get in a month.

53:58.768 --> 54:01.999
Gee, I wish I could stick around
here a couple of days longer.

54:02.105 --> 54:04.335
You know, I been dreamin'
of this moment all my life.

54:04.440 --> 54:07.432
I'm sorry, Shorty, but
you got to file a claim.

54:07.543 --> 54:10.569
As long as the trails are open, some
prospector is apt to discover this creek.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.807
First to register
gets discovery rights.

54:12.915 --> 54:14.815
You're the boss, boss.

54:14.917 --> 54:17.147
- When I get to Dawson, first
thing I'm gonna do- - Don't.

54:17.253 --> 54:19.187
- Don't what?
- Get drunk.

54:19.288 --> 54:21.586
Not a chance. I'm gonna
catch up on my meals.

54:21.691 --> 54:25.127
I like coffee, and my stomach's
been getting weaker every day.

54:26.429 --> 54:28.863
Well, so long, kid.

54:30.066 --> 54:33.001
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- So long.

54:34.971 --> 54:37.269
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Blake.

54:39.909 --> 54:41.877
Good-bye, Shorty.

54:41.978 --> 54:43.878
Come on, dogs.

54:47.183 --> 54:50.414
<i>- Hey.! Hey, Shorty.!
- What?</i>

54:50.520 --> 54:52.385
You forgot your meal ticket.

54:52.488 --> 54:55.423
Oh! Oh, yeah. Come to papa.

55:03.700 --> 55:05.600
Snake eyes.

55:05.702 --> 55:08.865
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.

55:08.971 --> 55:12.372
Well, good-bye.

55:12.475 --> 55:14.375
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

55:36.899 --> 55:39.129
What's the matter, boy?

55:40.236 --> 55:43.933
Buck!

55:45.041 --> 55:46.633
<i>Buck.!</i>

55:56.619 --> 55:59.087
- What's biting him?
- I don't know.

56:02.625 --> 56:04.923
- What's that, Jack?
- Wolves.

56:05.027 --> 56:08.793
That's funny. They don't
usually come so close to camp.

56:26.616 --> 56:28.709
Buck! Come here!

56:28.818 --> 56:30.718
Buck, come back here!

56:30.820 --> 56:34.449
If that's a pack, they'll
kill him. Buck, come here!

56:42.899 --> 56:44.867
<i>Buck.!</i>

56:51.607 --> 56:53.973
He's been changing lately.
Haven't you noticed?

56:54.076 --> 56:56.306
Seems as though he
remembers things up here.

56:56.412 --> 56:59.404
Buck, come back here! Buck!

57:41.724 --> 57:44.022
Buck! Buck, come here!

58:20.997 --> 58:23.591
Well, well. Welcome, stranger.

58:23.699 --> 58:25.633
How are ya? Huh?

58:30.039 --> 58:33.770
Well, seems we still
mean more to him than-

58:33.876 --> 58:35.776
than that old memory.

58:35.878 --> 58:39.143
<i>Yeah.</i>

58:43.719 --> 58:46.347
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

58:46.455 --> 58:49.424
You better come inside
before you change your mind.

58:58.734 --> 59:01.430
Come on, tough guy. Come on.

59:01.537 --> 59:03.562
<i>All right, kid, shake it up.</i>

59:03.673 --> 59:05.834
<i>Shake it up.</i>

59:05.942 --> 59:08.069
Oh, that's grand music.

59:08.177 --> 59:10.407
Yes.

59:10.513 --> 59:12.811
That's grand music.

59:12.915 --> 59:16.248
<i>Aw, that's grand music.</i>

59:16.352 --> 59:20.254
<i>Yeah. That's grand music.</i>

59:27.063 --> 59:30.260
That's lovely. Come on.

59:33.269 --> 59:35.396
<i>Shake it up.</i>

59:36.706 --> 59:39.106
<i>All right. You tired? Hmm?</i>

59:40.242 --> 59:42.437
All right, come on now.

59:42.545 --> 59:45.241
Let's pull. Together.

59:45.348 --> 59:48.078
One, two...

59:48.184 --> 59:49.913
- three-
- Oh!

59:56.392 --> 59:59.327
Well, we weren't together.

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:26.479
- Oh, I wish you hadn't.
- Why not?

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.319
I haven't let myself think about us.

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:32.326
- I didn't dare.
- Why?

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.589
Oh, I don't know. I-

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:36.756
I've had sort of a
strange premonition.

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.834
I don't know exactly
how to explain it, but-

01:00:38.934 --> 01:00:42.335
Explanations belong 5,000 miles away.

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.668
I only have one question...

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:47.242
and I only want one answer.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.010
You know the answer.

01:00:54.116 --> 01:00:57.244
I don't want to know the answer.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.821
<i>I want to have the answer.</i>

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:15.133
It just struck me, Mr. Blake.

01:01:15.237 --> 01:01:17.797
Now my back please, Kali.

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.966
I say, Mr. Blake, it's just
struck me that so far...

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:22.670
<i>I've taken this
entire matter on trust.</i>

01:01:22.778 --> 01:01:26.145
I believed your story and put
up the money for this outfit.

01:01:26.248 --> 01:01:28.978
I still believe your story,
but I think it's time...

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.519
you gave me a little
more positive proof.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.646
<i>You should show us the map, Mr. Blake.</i>

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:37.817
When I asked you in Dawson
City to help finance me...

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.862
I told you I knew the
location of a very rich mine.

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:44.194
I still know where that mine is.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.268
I'm taking you there.

01:01:46.368 --> 01:01:48.302
But the map, Mr. Blake-

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:51.373
Why do you continually
refuse to show us the map?

01:02:00.449 --> 01:02:02.417
I see.

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:05.487
Well, what's to prevent
our taking it away from you?

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:08.284
The possibility that
such a map may not exist-

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:10.722
except in my memory.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.226
Violence will do you no good.

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:23.305
You've come this far...

01:02:23.405 --> 01:02:26.966
and now there's nothing you
can do but go all the way.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:30.807
You'll gain nothing... by killing me.

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:33.814
Now, now. Who talked of killing?

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:36.817
We're not pirates, my dear man.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:40.480
We are gentleman adventurers
on the road to great riches, eh?

01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:44.389
Come, come, Kali. My towel.

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:09.783
Say, Jack.

01:03:09.885 --> 01:03:12.445
<i>- Buck's gone again.
- Yes, I know.</i>

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:15.319
<i>- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?</i>

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:19.292
Well, that's what happens to a
fella when he gets in bad company.

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:22.023
Mmm!

01:03:35.911 --> 01:03:37.902
Wait a minute.

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:44.653
According to all you told
us, and to all calculations...

01:03:44.753 --> 01:03:46.812
we should have located
the mine two days ago.

01:03:46.922 --> 01:03:49.982
I'm afraid you're bringing
out my worst side, Mr. Blake.

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:52.617
- Yes, I-I know, but- - If
you're trying to hoodwink us...

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:55.288
we are certain to find
it out sooner or later...

01:03:55.397 --> 01:03:57.365
and if such is the case...

01:03:57.466 --> 01:04:00.264
there is nothing left for
us to do but mourn for you.

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:02.303
I swear I'm doing the best I can.

01:04:02.404 --> 01:04:04.269
I followed the compass
directions exactly.

01:04:14.516 --> 01:04:16.609
<i>The burnt tree.!</i>

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:19.279
- The cabin! That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake...

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:23.256
how can you ever forgive me
for doubting your integrity?

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.293
You've placed me in a
most embarrassing position.

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:28.488
I scarcely know what to say.

01:04:38.974 --> 01:04:42.273
One for the master.

01:04:45.414 --> 01:04:47.780
And one for the dame.

01:04:49.251 --> 01:04:52.379
And one for the little
boy who's filing the claim.

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:54.547
Why, Jack, I never suspected.

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.989
The world doesn't understand me.

01:04:57.092 --> 01:04:59.060
At heart I'm an artist.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.994
Oh, I want to write
poetry. I want to compose.

01:05:02.097 --> 01:05:04.065
I want to sing, paint.

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:07.260
- Barns?
- Yes, yes. Those too.

01:05:07.369 --> 01:05:09.303
I want to starve in a garret.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.566
Wear me hair long. Get
egg on a flowing tie.

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:15.110
In other words, be a genius. Ah
- But no.

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:17.405
No, the world sneers at me talent...

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.777
and instead it gives me... gold.

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:22.851
Oh, my poor boy.

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:39.862
You seem to have all the
comforts of home, Mr. Thornton-

01:05:39.968 --> 01:05:43.961
A comfortable cabin, golden
evidence of more comforts to come...

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:47.236
and a beautiful lady.

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:51.242
You will oblige me greatly
if you will assist...

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.781
in making this incident
as painless as possible.

01:05:55.617 --> 01:05:57.517
Come on, get it over with.
What are you going to do?

01:05:57.619 --> 01:06:00.144
Do? My dear man, nothing at all.

01:06:00.255 --> 01:06:02.587
The important thing is-

01:06:02.691 --> 01:06:05.558
We're going back by water,
Kali, using Mr. Thornton's canoe.

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:08.221
<i>You may destroy our burros.</i>

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:15.369
As I was saying, the important
thing is to prevent you people...

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:18.907
from filing claim on this
charming site before we do.

01:06:19.007 --> 01:06:21.237
And how do you expect to do that?

01:06:21.343 --> 01:06:23.311
Oh, very easily-

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:27.143
by leaving you here and destroying
all means of transportation.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:35.451
<i>- If you can't get back to
Dawson to file, why, then...</i>

01:06:35.557 --> 01:06:38.082
<i>- you can't get back to
Dawson to file, now can you?</i>

01:06:38.193 --> 01:06:40.093
So we'll file instead.

01:06:40.195 --> 01:06:42.095
If you want to work the
mine while we're gone...

01:06:42.197 --> 01:06:44.256
you're very welcome
to do so, of course.

01:06:44.366 --> 01:06:47.665
We'll be glad to recompense you
for your trouble when we get back.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:52.833
Meanwhile we'll take with us your
gun and ammunition, axes, et cetera.

01:06:52.941 --> 01:06:55.068
It would be a grave
error to leave behind...

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.737
the implements for building
another canoe, wouldn't it?

01:06:57.846 --> 01:06:59.746
Kali!

01:06:59.848 --> 01:07:01.941
<i>Francois.! Kali.!</i>

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:04.746
<i>Come here.!</i>

01:07:04.853 --> 01:07:07.583
Look here, Smith. Why
can't we do business?

01:07:07.689 --> 01:07:10.351
I'm always open to an honest
proposition, Mr. Thornton.

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.359
We'll give you the claim, all of it.

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:14.361
You can have what gold we've got.

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:17.125
But leave us some way of getting out
of here. The winter snows are coming on.

01:07:17.232 --> 01:07:20.429
My dear man, you call that
a business proposition?

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:23.437
We already have the mine, and
the gold is ours by right of-

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:25.598
How shall I put it?

01:07:25.707 --> 01:07:27.766
By right of conquest.

01:07:27.876 --> 01:07:30.777
Do you mind if we don't
argue the point anymore?

01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:34.314
Let's help ourselves.

01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:37.180
Mr. Thornton would
only squander the gold.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:42.183
I must commend your sense
of humor, Mr. Thornton.

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:44.987
<i>Very few people would be able to
smile on an occasion like this.</i>

01:07:45.093 --> 01:07:47.789
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

01:07:47.896 --> 01:07:50.091
I remember watching a magician once.

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:53.168
From an apparently empty hat,
he shortly produced a rabbit.

01:07:53.268 --> 01:07:55.896
<i>He smiled very much as
you're smiling now...</i>

01:07:56.004 --> 01:07:58.632
<i>because, I imagine, he
knew all the while...</i>

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.300
<i>that he had that rabbit up his sleeve.</i>

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.878
<i>You've something up
your sleeve, perhaps.</i>

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:06.573
Perhaps.

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:10.847
Roll up your sleeve, Mr.
Thornton. There's no rabbit there.

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:13.683
Come, come. Don't let's
strain our friendship.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:23.631
Madam.

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:10.770
Careful, you idiot. You
might have split the bottom.

01:09:12.514 --> 01:09:14.413
We'll be back, my friends.

01:09:14.515 --> 01:09:17.417
For the time being, good-bye...

01:09:17.519 --> 01:09:19.453
and good-bye.

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:39.966
Look out!

01:10:16.578 --> 01:10:19.308
Well, they wanted
gold. Now they got it.

01:11:02.457 --> 01:11:05.426
Hey, Claire, get the medicine
kit and some hot water.

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.767
Is he badly hurt?

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:16.804
Yeah. He's got a nasty
crack on the skull.

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.805
Some prospector, I guess.

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:21.842
Go away, Buck. Get out of the way.

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:27.040
John! John!

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:29.913
<i>Oh, John.</i>

01:11:30.018 --> 01:11:31.918
<i>John, darling.!</i>

01:11:43.398 --> 01:11:45.332
Claire, dearest...

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.402
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.

01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:51.898
All right, dear.

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:57.277
I thought I'd...

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:59.370
lost you.

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:25.498
Try to rest, please.

01:12:56.938 --> 01:12:58.838
He's feeling much better this morning.

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:01.204
He remembers everything, thank heaven.

01:13:01.309 --> 01:13:03.777
It wasn't so serious as we thought.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:05.938
He wants to see you, Jack.

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:11.478
What are you going to say to him?

01:13:16.224 --> 01:13:18.124
I wanted you...

01:13:18.226 --> 01:13:21.286
and I took you with us.

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:23.864
Well, I'm keeping you.

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.536
Jack.

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:32.298
You know I love you, don't you?

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:35.467
You couldn't doubt that, could you?

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:44.318
Well, he needs me.

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:47.081
You have your law and...

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.248
I have mine.

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:20.416
Best thing you can do, Blake, is to
get out of here as quick as you can.

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:23.116
<i>You need medical
attention. Take the canoe.</i>

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:26.092
<i>It's easy going now, but it won't
be when the heavy snows come on.</i>

01:14:28.496 --> 01:14:30.794
Will you come with us?

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:32.799
No, I'll stay here and work the mine.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:35.461
When you come back in the spring,
we'll divide what I've found.

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:59.890
I came to say good-bye to Buck.

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:02.429
He never would have forgiven
me if I'd forgotten that.

01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:04.498
Would you, Buck?

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:13.832
You could have skipped that.

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:16.103
You're only making it
tougher on everybody.

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:26.044
Oh, Jack, put your arms around me.

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.657
Well, I'll be seeing you.

01:15:37.265 --> 01:15:39.790
Yes.

01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:42.233
You'll be seeing me.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.765
I'll be seeing you too.

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:52.179
Every day and every
night and every minute.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:57.314
This isn't the end.

01:15:58.753 --> 01:16:00.721
It can't be.

01:16:45.266 --> 01:16:48.167
Careful of that first stretch of
rapids. After that it's clear sailing.

01:16:48.269 --> 01:16:50.237
Good-bye, Thornton.

01:16:51.439 --> 01:16:53.407
And God bless you.

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.499
Good-bye, Blake.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.180
Good-bye, Jack.

01:17:03.284 --> 01:17:05.184
Good-bye, Claire.

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:10.814
It's hard to say no to
that call, isn't it, Buck?

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.386
It's all right, boy. Go ahead.

01:19:41.976 --> 01:19:44.069
Shorty?

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:48.512
- Yeah!
- Shorty!

01:19:48.616 --> 01:19:51.278
- Hello, boss!
- Why, you old son of a gun.

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:53.786
You came just in time.
You saved my life.

01:19:53.888 --> 01:19:55.822
Well, look at you.
You're all dressed up.

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:57.858
Yeah. We're in the
money. I filed the claim.

01:19:57.959 --> 01:19:59.859
We're rich
- Richer than Astor's pup!

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:02.555
No trouble at all. I went
right in and signed the names.

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:05.565
- Oh, and the
claim was- - Shorty.

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:11.604
What's that?

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:13.606
That's our new cook.

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:16.302
- Where'd you get it?
- I won it in a crap game.
