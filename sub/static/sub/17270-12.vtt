00:00.486 --> 00:02.162
My name is Stephen Jameson.

00:02.288 --> 00:04.001
I'm one of the Tomorrow People.

00:04.256 --> 00:06.127
They call our powers the three T's.

00:06.225 --> 00:07.392
- Telepathy...
- Stephen?

00:07.493 --> 00:08.690
Telekinesis...

00:08.760 --> 00:09.910
And teleportation.

00:10.028 --> 00:12.896
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:12.898 --> 00:15.265
- No!
- ... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:15.552 --> 00:17.986
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:17.988 --> 00:19.688
is to find my father.

00:19.690 --> 00:23.858
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

00:23.860 --> 00:25.860
Previously on The Tomorrow People...

00:26.052 --> 00:28.486
You know, you never talk
about your time at Ultra.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.521
Jedikiah took me in from less than nothing.

00:30.523 --> 00:33.891
Then it went from being
SuperKids Summer Camp

00:33.893 --> 00:35.025
to people dying.

00:35.027 --> 00:36.527
You remember Peter.

00:36.529 --> 00:38.061
Hey. Hey, pal.

00:39.965 --> 00:41.932
I was trying to read his mind

00:41.934 --> 00:45.202
and he did this thing where
he pushed me out of his head.

00:45.204 --> 00:46.603
So, he's like you.

00:46.605 --> 00:47.938
You three did make the cut.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.639
So congratulations on that.

00:49.641 --> 00:51.408
But the winnowing process continues.

00:51.410 --> 00:53.576
We haven't finished separating
the wheat from the chaff.

01:17.634 --> 01:18.935
Astrid Finch?

01:20.837 --> 01:22.004
Astrid Finch?

01:24.607 --> 01:26.575
- Yes.
- We're ready for you.

01:27.744 --> 01:28.777
Okay.

01:35.752 --> 01:37.953
There's no piano.

01:37.955 --> 01:40.622
Nobody said anything
about singing acapella.

01:42.759 --> 01:45.894
Am I in the right room for
the School of Music audition?

01:45.896 --> 01:47.696
Your name is Astrid Finch.

01:47.698 --> 01:48.931
Yeah.

01:48.933 --> 01:51.132
You're in the right place.

01:51.134 --> 01:53.201
Would you mind taking a
few steps back, Astrid?

01:56.138 --> 01:57.505
Uh, why?

01:59.175 --> 02:00.875
Don't want to make a mess, do we?

02:06.015 --> 02:07.982
2-1, me.

02:07.984 --> 02:10.417
Why'd you stop it? You didn't tap out.

02:10.419 --> 02:12.854
Well, normally when someone screams
in pain, it means stop, Hillary.

02:12.856 --> 02:15.723
Don't you dare mark that as a
loss, this fight's not over yet.

02:20.629 --> 02:22.997
Relax, we're just supposed
to be sparring, remember?

02:23.209 --> 02:25.242
- That's easy for you to say.
- What's that supposed to mean?

02:25.244 --> 02:27.977
This whole competition is
rigged so that you can win it.

02:27.979 --> 02:29.613
Really? This again?

02:29.615 --> 02:30.914
I thought we were supposed
to be working together.

02:30.916 --> 02:32.416
We're not a team.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.384
Your uncle made it pretty clear
that it's survival of the fittest,

02:34.386 --> 02:37.654
and that's me, so get
your ass back in the ring.

02:37.656 --> 02:39.089
All right. All right.

02:39.091 --> 02:40.289
Winner?

02:40.291 --> 02:41.725
Jameson.

02:41.727 --> 02:44.260
All right, that's enough
practice for today guys.

02:44.262 --> 02:45.661
Dr. Price?

02:45.663 --> 02:48.998
Could I ask you a quick question
about a procedural matter?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.299
Certainly.

02:50.301 --> 02:52.102
Well, I was wondering what the policy is

02:52.104 --> 02:54.704
for trainees who share their powers
with people out in the regular world.

02:54.706 --> 02:56.071
You know, humans.

02:56.073 --> 02:58.774
Zero tolerance policy.
You should know this.

02:58.776 --> 03:02.211
Any paranormal caught betraying
his or her powers will be punished.

03:02.213 --> 03:03.646
No exceptions.

03:03.648 --> 03:06.682
Got it. But, what about the
humans who find out about us?

03:06.684 --> 03:08.718
I mean, I'm sure they're liabilities too.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.587
Indeed, which is why we terminate
them with extreme prejudice.

03:11.589 --> 03:13.355
Any other procedural
questions you might have

03:13.357 --> 03:15.657
that I could clear up
for you while I'm here?

03:16.926 --> 03:18.026
Good.

03:19.629 --> 03:21.797
Hey, what the hell was that about?

03:21.799 --> 03:24.900
I'm sure you've kept a lid on things,
even with your closest friends.

03:24.902 --> 03:27.669
But in case you haven't, I'm
leveling the playing field.

03:27.671 --> 03:28.803
Nephew.

03:34.343 --> 03:36.311
No one means, "no one."

03:36.313 --> 03:38.647
And you're supposed to be
helping me with my audition.

03:38.649 --> 03:41.349
I know, but you're sure you didn't
accidentally tell someone about my powers?

03:41.351 --> 03:43.785
Yeah, I'm positive.

03:43.977 --> 03:46.043
One, you told me not to tell anyone.

03:46.045 --> 03:49.447
And two, I don't want to
sound like a crazy person.

03:49.449 --> 03:53.150
Did anybody suspicious
approach you? Uh, guys in suits?

03:53.152 --> 03:55.519
Stephen, do you want to
tell me what's going on?

03:55.521 --> 03:57.221
Nothing, I'm... I'm just...

03:57.223 --> 03:58.422
Being paranoid.

04:00.025 --> 04:01.525
- You can trust me.
- And I do.

04:01.527 --> 04:04.427
Just, there is this new girl at Ultra

04:04.429 --> 04:06.530
who will do anything she
can to get me kicked out.

04:06.532 --> 04:08.198
And if she ever found out about you...

04:13.872 --> 04:15.839
Luca, what the hell are
you doing in the crawlspace?

04:15.841 --> 04:16.974
You eavesdropping?

04:16.976 --> 04:19.541
Dude, you're being paranoid.

04:19.543 --> 04:22.112
I was just looking for sleeping bags.

04:22.113 --> 04:23.113
Why?

04:24.181 --> 04:25.382
For the camping trip.

04:27.518 --> 04:31.287
Luca, did you find that box of
your dad's old camping equipment?

04:31.289 --> 04:34.891
Yeah, yeah I did. It smelled like a
family of rats was living in there.

04:34.893 --> 04:37.259
Ha. Don't worry, got plenty of extra gear.

04:40.163 --> 04:41.397
What's going on?

04:42.833 --> 04:45.034
Uh... you didn't tell him.

04:45.036 --> 04:47.102
Peter's taking us camping.

04:47.104 --> 04:49.539
For the weekend. Upstate.

04:49.541 --> 04:53.175
I'm all for it, you
know. Man versus nature.

04:53.177 --> 04:56.811
Testing our mettle against the elements.

04:56.813 --> 04:59.481
- Uh, give me a hand with this?
- Yeah, you got it P-Dawg.

04:59.483 --> 05:02.484
- Here you go. P-Dawg.
- Yeah, you know it.

05:04.754 --> 05:06.388
When were you planning on telling me?

05:06.390 --> 05:08.924
Now.

05:08.926 --> 05:12.193
Honey, I'm sorry. Look, I honestly
didn't think you'd really want to come.

05:12.195 --> 05:14.228
I mean, last time we went
camping was with your Dad and...

05:14.230 --> 05:16.297
Do you think I'm going to let
Luca and you go into the woods

05:16.299 --> 05:19.034
- with some stranger?
- Come on, he's hardly a stranger.

05:19.036 --> 05:21.002
I'm coming with you.

05:21.004 --> 05:22.103
Okay.

05:23.205 --> 05:25.039
- Really?
- Sure.

05:25.041 --> 05:26.407
It'll be fun.

05:30.879 --> 05:34.515
Look, I want to keep an eye on Astrid
because of Hillary and her veiled threats.

05:34.517 --> 05:36.451
But I can't send my family
out into the woods with some

05:36.453 --> 05:39.353
potential paranormal psychopath
and I can't be two places at once.

05:39.355 --> 05:41.221
Okay, just for the sake of argument,

05:41.223 --> 05:43.390
say your Mom's boyfriend
did push you out of his head.

05:43.392 --> 05:45.492
Just because he has powers,
doesn't make him an Ultra agent.

05:45.494 --> 05:47.327
Does seem a little coincidental.

05:47.329 --> 05:49.429
Tim, what did you get on this Peter guy?

05:49.431 --> 05:53.500
Peter Henry MacKenzie of 510
Cornelius Street in the Village.

05:53.502 --> 05:57.204
No criminal record. No outstanding taxes.

05:57.206 --> 05:59.473
Nothing too untoward
in his browsing history.

05:59.655 --> 06:02.555
You can check our browsing histories?

06:02.557 --> 06:05.057
It sounds like your mom's new
boyfriend is a stand up guy.

06:05.059 --> 06:08.328
Not that I've looked at anything on
the Internet that I am ashamed of.

06:08.330 --> 06:11.364
Stephen, what is the
worst case scenario here?

06:11.366 --> 06:13.400
That Peter is some kind of secret operative

06:13.402 --> 06:15.668
who's leading us out in the
woods so he can murder us.

06:15.670 --> 06:18.337
Except that if he is like
us, he can't kill people.

06:18.339 --> 06:20.973
And if he tries to pull
anything suspicious,

06:20.975 --> 06:24.143
all you gotta do is contact
Cara and we teleport in.

06:24.145 --> 06:26.312
All right, you guys got my back. Thank you.

06:26.314 --> 06:28.147
But who's going to take
care of Astrid when I'm gone?

06:28.149 --> 06:31.249
The windows, they just pop open...

06:31.251 --> 06:33.485
Okay, stop it, both of
you, you're being paranoid.

06:33.487 --> 06:35.554
No one cares about whatever smut
you're looking at on the Internet.

06:35.556 --> 06:37.556
And no one is gonna hurt
Astrid while you're gone.

06:47.433 --> 06:48.967
Stephen.

06:51.204 --> 06:53.504
Listen, I'll check on Astrid for you.

06:53.506 --> 06:55.373
You don't think I'm being paranoid?

06:55.375 --> 06:57.742
Probably. But if you're not...

06:57.744 --> 07:00.712
I've seen what Ultra does
to humans who know too much.

07:00.714 --> 07:02.314
Better safe than sorry.

07:09.988 --> 07:12.457
Flash number 159.

07:12.459 --> 07:15.393
The conclusion of the Dark Flash saga.

07:15.395 --> 07:17.194
You're the first to hold it.

07:17.196 --> 07:20.664
You know, it's uncanny. It's
like you can smell the new issues.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.066
It's easy.

07:22.068 --> 07:24.401
I just read your mind to know
when the new shipments arrive.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.702
Come on, get out of here.

07:38.349 --> 07:40.550
Why didn't you tell me what...

07:40.552 --> 07:42.686
Get out of here, kid.

07:42.688 --> 07:44.621
- No.
- Are you crazy? Go.

07:44.623 --> 07:46.289
Put the gun down.

07:46.491 --> 07:48.625
Look, please don't hurt the kid.

07:48.627 --> 07:50.526
He's just a kid with a wild imagination.

07:50.528 --> 07:51.895
I'm not going anywhere.

07:58.868 --> 07:59.902
What?

08:03.840 --> 08:05.341
You okay?

08:05.343 --> 08:07.577
- Yeah. Hey...
- I don't have time to explain.

08:07.579 --> 08:10.579
Look, Tony, whatever happens...

08:10.581 --> 08:13.716
You can never say a word
about what you just saw.

08:13.718 --> 08:15.383
Do you understand?

08:16.720 --> 08:17.720
Yeah.

08:20.405 --> 08:26.721

08:38.480 --> 08:40.147
Surveillance.

08:40.149 --> 08:42.817
Taken the night of one of our recent
engagements with the Tomorrow People.

08:42.818 --> 08:44.251
Who's the girl?

08:44.253 --> 08:45.520
It's your nephew's best friend.

08:45.522 --> 08:47.888
A civilian who has been compromised.

08:47.890 --> 08:51.191
The footage was redacted and buried
along with Stephen's late partner.

08:57.598 --> 08:59.933
Before you implicate
two agents in a cover-up,

08:59.935 --> 09:02.569
I think you should think long and
hard about the severity of your claim.

09:04.204 --> 09:06.840
This is not just some random coincidence.

09:06.842 --> 09:09.475
I saw them teleport. Together.

09:09.477 --> 09:13.312
I realize that this is a risk,
me coming to you, given that he...

09:15.416 --> 09:17.216
What I mean to say...

09:17.218 --> 09:22.388
is I know that nepotism would never play
into your ability to assess a situation.

09:22.390 --> 09:25.791
Well, I appreciate the vote
of confidence, Ms. Cole.

09:25.793 --> 09:27.326
I'll take this from here.

10:07.366 --> 10:09.634
Hey. Don't scream. It's me, John.

10:09.636 --> 10:11.469
Stephen's friend. We met at his house.

10:11.631 --> 10:13.097
What the hell are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me.

10:13.099 --> 10:14.665
Well, he asked me to keep an eye on you.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.067
I don't need a bodyguard.

10:16.069 --> 10:18.335
Well, your best friend seems
to think you could be in danger.

10:18.337 --> 10:19.837
Well, he likes to think a
lot of crazy things sometimes.

10:19.839 --> 10:21.305
I don't disagree with you.

10:21.307 --> 10:23.875
But I made him a promise
and I'm a man of my word.

10:23.877 --> 10:25.809
Tell me, what would anyone want with me?

10:25.811 --> 10:27.611
I'm not a part of your world.

10:27.613 --> 10:29.513
And quite frankly, I don't want to be.

10:29.515 --> 10:30.648
No offense.

10:32.049 --> 10:33.817
Sometimes you don't get a choice.

10:35.754 --> 10:36.953
What's all this?

10:36.955 --> 10:38.689
Singer at Heart.

10:38.691 --> 10:40.391
Landing the Audition.

10:40.393 --> 10:42.692
If you must know, I have
an audition tomorrow.

10:42.694 --> 10:46.096
I would actually appreciate it if you
left me alone to concentrate and prepare.

10:46.098 --> 10:48.531
They already bumped my time,
so I'm kind of under the gun.

10:48.533 --> 10:49.833
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

10:49.835 --> 10:51.802
If you notice anything weird...

10:51.804 --> 10:54.637
Like being stalked on the Uptown 3 train?

10:55.739 --> 10:57.707
Skype this.

10:57.709 --> 10:59.509
That is a library book. You're
defacing public property.

10:59.511 --> 11:01.411
This isn't a joke, Astrid.

11:01.413 --> 11:02.912
Ultra doesn't mess around.

11:02.914 --> 11:04.046
Trust me.

11:10.387 --> 11:12.655
Well, it's come to my
attention that, uh, one of you

11:12.657 --> 11:16.425
has used his or her powers
in violation of Ultra policy.

11:16.427 --> 11:18.794
Which is to say, in front of humans.

11:18.796 --> 11:20.495
Now,

11:20.497 --> 11:23.933
I could have you all
psychically scanned, but, uh...

11:23.935 --> 11:26.635
God knows what secrets that'll turn up.

11:26.637 --> 11:28.403
Alternately,

11:28.405 --> 11:31.673
the guilty party could step forward and
save everybody the pain and humiliation.

11:40.850 --> 11:41.950
You're dismissed.

11:49.591 --> 11:50.791
I'm sorry.

11:52.594 --> 11:54.395
I shouldn't have used my powers.

11:56.031 --> 11:57.465
But this guy had a gun.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.967
Shh.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.835
John, you're our youngest recruit.

12:00.837 --> 12:03.037
And that comes with a lot of pressure.

12:03.039 --> 12:07.508
I know it was very hard for you to
step forward, but it's for the best.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.042
What are you gonna do to him?

12:10.846 --> 12:13.313
Tony's my only friend.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.382
Hey.

12:14.384 --> 12:15.616
Aren't I your friend?

12:24.926 --> 12:26.526
Ah.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.395
I've got the perfect place.

12:29.531 --> 12:32.465
This is so beautiful. Yeah.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.601
Look, Cara, I know our kind can't kill,

12:34.603 --> 12:36.403
but what if he just chops off our hands

12:36.405 --> 12:39.406
and leaves us out here to
starve or freeze to death?

12:39.408 --> 12:41.708
Wow, we went straight
to the dark place, huh?

12:42.943 --> 12:45.578
Have you seen any horror movies?

12:45.580 --> 12:47.980
How are things at the Batcave?

12:47.982 --> 12:51.518
Well, Russ is still laid up, but he
hasn't lost his acquired sense of humor.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.086
Now I have to listen to his semi-coherent
jokes and pretend they're funny.

12:54.088 --> 12:56.722
I can hear you. I know.

12:56.724 --> 12:59.992
Fingers crossed, there are no new
breakouts. I've got my hands full.

12:59.994 --> 13:03.629
- Have fun with your s'mores.
-  I want s'mores!

13:03.711 --> 13:05.878
I know you think I'm
being overly suspicious,

13:05.880 --> 13:08.981
but did Tim find anything
else out about Peter?

13:08.983 --> 13:11.617
He did, actually.

13:11.619 --> 13:14.052
Peter MacKenzie changed his name.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.721
I knew it.

13:15.723 --> 13:18.490
Until 2006, his last name was Foster.

13:18.492 --> 13:20.025
But before you freak out, there are plenty

13:20.027 --> 13:21.860
of potential explanations.

13:21.862 --> 13:23.128
What was that?

13:23.130 --> 13:24.630
Cara, can you hear me?

13:24.632 --> 13:26.765
Uh... wow!

13:27.799 --> 13:30.435
Amazing! Isn't it?

13:30.437 --> 13:32.737
Yeah, really nice.

13:32.739 --> 13:34.406
Cara, he brought me here

13:34.408 --> 13:37.475
because he knew the water would
interfere with my telepathy.

13:37.477 --> 13:39.810
Cara? Cara?

13:39.812 --> 13:41.546
Stephen, I can't hear you.

13:41.548 --> 13:43.614
Damn it.

13:43.616 --> 13:46.150
Uh, something... bit me.

13:47.986 --> 13:50.621
Huh. Well, we're, uh we're almost there.

13:56.494 --> 13:58.429
Setting up camp by the river, huh?

13:58.431 --> 14:00.464
Yeah. Planned it this way.

14:00.466 --> 14:01.965
Best sunrise in the whole forest.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.469
You brought a gun?

14:05.471 --> 14:08.072
Figured you boys might want
to go after some ducks with me.

14:08.074 --> 14:10.541
Your mom said it was okay.

14:10.543 --> 14:12.076
Sweet.

14:12.078 --> 14:13.944
- Sounds awesome.
- All right, then.

14:15.414 --> 14:16.646
Locked and loaded.

14:26.684 --> 14:28.652
Excuse me, Dr. Price, sir?

14:28.654 --> 14:30.119
I just wanted to follow
up with you regarding

14:30.121 --> 14:32.355
your nephew's human confidante, Ms. Finch.

14:32.357 --> 14:34.624
Yes, I have the situation under control.

14:34.626 --> 14:37.927
And Stephen will be reprimanded,
the same as everyone else, right?

14:37.929 --> 14:40.163
I don't answer to you, Ms. Cole.

14:40.165 --> 14:41.364
And, uh...

14:41.366 --> 14:44.801
you know, a strong work
ethic is to be commended,

14:44.803 --> 14:49.005
but internal sabotage based on
ruthless ambition and personal vendetta

14:49.007 --> 14:50.372
won't be tolerated.

14:50.374 --> 14:52.842
Yes, but, the girl,
you're going to kill her?

14:55.679 --> 14:57.847
If I say "yes," and you smile, you're next,

14:57.849 --> 14:59.315
you got it?

15:01.618 --> 15:02.618
Yes.

15:04.053 --> 15:05.987
But I want you to understand something.

15:05.989 --> 15:09.090
You and everyone like you have the
privilege of working at this agency

15:09.092 --> 15:12.728
for the exclusive benefit of human beings.

15:12.730 --> 15:15.030
And when one of them has to be
sacrificed for the greater good,

15:15.032 --> 15:17.732
it's not a cause for celebration
or personal achievement, you got it?

15:19.302 --> 15:20.302
Yes, sir.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.571
Nice talk.

15:28.311 --> 15:29.911
All right.

15:29.913 --> 15:32.079
We're almost there.

15:32.081 --> 15:34.315
Cara, if you can hear me, no pressure,

15:34.317 --> 15:37.318
but I've got a gun wielding paranormal
leading me on a wild goose chase.

15:38.787 --> 15:39.920
You say something?

15:39.922 --> 15:41.789
What? No. Why?

15:43.091 --> 15:44.925
Why are you being so damn jumpy?

15:44.927 --> 15:47.328
I'm not. I'm just not
comfortable around guns.

15:47.330 --> 15:50.364
Well you're right not to be,
Stephen, they're dangerous tools

15:50.366 --> 15:52.333
that need to be handled with respect.

15:52.335 --> 15:54.001
Don't. Move.

16:00.608 --> 16:02.343
Nice shot.

16:02.345 --> 16:03.810
Thanks. Where'd you
learn to shoot like that?

16:03.812 --> 16:06.279
Uh, I grew up in the country.

16:06.281 --> 16:08.615
You were born in Detroit.

16:08.617 --> 16:10.784
Yeah, that's right. How did you...

16:10.786 --> 16:11.985
Tell me you didn't web stalk him.

16:11.987 --> 16:13.587
No, that's... that's okay.

16:13.589 --> 16:15.822
He's just doing his homework.

16:15.824 --> 16:19.593
We moved upstate when my mom remarried.

16:19.595 --> 16:21.160
My stepdad taught me how to shoot.

16:21.162 --> 16:23.763
He was a physics teacher like me,

16:23.765 --> 16:27.066
but he was happiest when
he was away from the world.

16:27.068 --> 16:29.969
I guess I inherited that from him.

16:29.971 --> 16:32.038
Even though we weren't actually related.

16:33.807 --> 16:36.009
Gosh. Just...

16:36.011 --> 16:38.010
love being out in nature.

16:38.012 --> 16:39.912
So peaceful, so perfect.

16:41.915 --> 16:43.148
So dead.

16:55.261 --> 16:56.694
Astrid Finch?

17:01.334 --> 17:02.234
Yes?

17:03.736 --> 17:05.537
We're ready for you.

17:06.638 --> 17:07.771
Okay.

17:10.108 --> 17:12.076
Oh, my God, this...

17:12.078 --> 17:14.211
this perspective is amazing.

17:17.148 --> 17:19.016
Take only memories.

17:19.018 --> 17:21.117
Leave only footprints,
you know what I'm saying?

17:24.189 --> 17:25.957
Careful! Oh!

17:27.960 --> 17:29.793
Woah.

17:29.795 --> 17:31.628
That was lucky.

17:31.630 --> 17:33.630
Yeah. Real lucky.

17:33.632 --> 17:35.266
Hey!

17:35.268 --> 17:36.567
Hey!

17:36.569 --> 17:37.701
I see you brought us, dinner.

17:39.071 --> 17:40.171
Well done.

17:45.677 --> 17:46.977
You're in the right place.

17:49.948 --> 17:52.048
Would you mind taking a
few steps back, Astrid?

17:55.052 --> 17:56.119
Uh, why?

18:00.191 --> 18:01.958
Don't want to make a mess, do we?

18:18.274 --> 18:19.274
Oh, my God.

18:23.814 --> 18:25.781
Who are those people?

18:25.783 --> 18:27.817
They're still after us, right?
We gotta get out of here.

18:30.186 --> 18:31.186
Oh, my God.

18:32.589 --> 18:33.889
John, you're shot.

18:33.891 --> 18:35.891
I'm just a little winged, is all.

18:35.893 --> 18:38.660
No, no, no. Okay, let
me get you to a hospital.

18:38.662 --> 18:39.761
Can you teleport us out?

18:39.763 --> 18:41.196
First things first.

18:41.198 --> 18:42.797
I need you to stop the bleeding.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.768
Until you do, neither
of us is going anywhere.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.451
I have to call an ambulance.

19:04.453 --> 19:06.686
No, we can't involve the authorities.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.054
Ultra is everywhere.

19:09.290 --> 19:11.424
They'll know if we try to escape.

19:11.426 --> 19:13.626
We're going room by room.

19:13.628 --> 19:16.096
We got two teams on the third and
fourth floor moving east to west.

19:16.098 --> 19:17.597
Can you teleport us to an ER?

19:17.599 --> 19:20.566
No, I'm too weak, that's
why I could only get us here.

19:20.568 --> 19:22.568
What about your friends? Cara? Russell?

19:22.570 --> 19:24.370
They can't teleport in.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.472
Ultra will know if we use our powers.

19:26.474 --> 19:29.208
They can use a trace to
locate our exact position.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.310
They'll be on top of us in seconds.

19:31.312 --> 19:35.014
Right, so we just wait for them to find us.

19:35.016 --> 19:37.049
Find something to wrap around this.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.584
If I can gather enough strength,
I can get us out of here.

19:39.586 --> 19:41.987
We'll have one chance to
teleport out, that's all.

19:41.989 --> 19:44.423
Otherwise, they'll kill us.

19:44.425 --> 19:46.225
Understand?

19:46.227 --> 19:49.194
I save you. You save me.

19:49.196 --> 19:51.095
And if I fail, we both die.

19:53.099 --> 19:54.766
- I get it.
- Okay.

19:54.768 --> 19:57.468
I'll be fine. Just hold it right there.

20:00.339 --> 20:04.042
Hey look, maybe, uh, maybe
we got off on the wrong foot.

20:04.044 --> 20:08.179
I'm not sure what I did to upset
you, but I want to make it right.

20:09.248 --> 20:10.614
Who are you?

20:10.616 --> 20:11.615
Really?

20:13.419 --> 20:15.520
I'm just a guy who likes your mom.

20:15.522 --> 20:18.189
Why'd you change your last name?

20:18.191 --> 20:19.424
Excuse me?

20:19.426 --> 20:21.692
From Foster to MacKenzie, 2006.

20:21.694 --> 20:24.762
Boy, you really have
done your homework. Woah.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.068
I changed it when my stepdad died.

20:31.070 --> 20:34.104
I know it seems silly, a
grown man changing his name,

20:34.106 --> 20:36.406
but he was the man who
raised me when my father left.

20:36.408 --> 20:40.577
So, when I lost him, taking his
last name was my way of honoring him.

20:40.579 --> 20:42.112
Meant a lot to my Mom.

20:43.814 --> 20:48.651
Sometimes we do things for our mothers,
we put their happiness before our own.

20:48.653 --> 20:50.487
I know what you are.

20:50.489 --> 20:52.021
A high school physics teacher?

20:52.023 --> 20:54.157
- I just don't know who sent you.
- Who sent me?

20:54.159 --> 20:55.692
Who you're working for.

20:55.694 --> 20:57.694
I work for the public schools, Stephen.

20:57.696 --> 20:58.795
Are you supposed to kill me?

20:59.797 --> 21:01.598
Are those your orders?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.299
Come on, it's just you and me now, Pete.

21:03.301 --> 21:05.367
We don't have to play any more games.

21:05.369 --> 21:07.070
I know you pushed me out of your mind.

21:07.072 --> 21:09.606
- I know you TK'd your camera.
- TK'd?

21:09.608 --> 21:11.608
But what do you want with me?

21:11.610 --> 21:13.675
Nothing. Look, Stephen, your mom
told me about your psychiatric issues.

21:13.677 --> 21:15.611
Have you considered inpatient treatment?

21:15.613 --> 21:17.746
- My second cousin went to a place in Oregon.
- Okay.

21:17.748 --> 21:18.747
Enough!

21:20.717 --> 21:23.319
I know you have powers. Whoa, whoa...

21:29.159 --> 21:31.026
So use them to save yourself.

21:40.436 --> 21:41.637
Use 'em.

21:45.407 --> 21:46.474
Use them.

22:00.289 --> 22:01.589
You're crazy!

22:04.092 --> 22:06.727
Stephen shouldn't have told you about us.

22:06.729 --> 22:09.997
It's because of him
you're in this whole mess.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.101
Sorry.

22:14.103 --> 22:16.037
I didn't mean to badmouth your bestie.

22:18.740 --> 22:21.708
You know, bad as it was being shot at,

22:21.710 --> 22:24.478
the times when Stephen blocked
me out of his life were worse.

22:25.780 --> 22:28.215
I really thought I was losing him.

22:28.217 --> 22:30.450
But then when there was a
reason for the way he was acting,

22:30.452 --> 22:32.352
it was kind of like I
started to get him back.

22:33.621 --> 22:36.322
The way you talk about him, it's like...

22:43.297 --> 22:48.034
It's okay. Just keep talking. I'll be fine.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.473
This is not how I thought
today would go at all.

22:54.475 --> 22:56.075
Sorry about your audition.

22:58.278 --> 22:59.679
What were you gonna sing?

22:59.681 --> 23:01.380
It doesn't matter.

23:01.382 --> 23:03.349
Come on, I wanna hear it.

23:03.351 --> 23:05.518
No, it's embarrassing.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.253
It'll take my mind off the pain.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.256
What if they kill us both?

23:13.026 --> 23:15.560
I haven't accomplished anything.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.697
What do you got, like, a
bucket list or something?

23:18.699 --> 23:20.232
Maybe.

23:20.234 --> 23:21.700
What's on it?

23:21.702 --> 23:25.403
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Come on.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.406
- You'll make fun of me.
-  I won't. I promise.

23:30.175 --> 23:32.043
I wanna sing at Carnegie Hall.

23:33.379 --> 23:36.548
Be fluent in Japanese
and spend a year in Tokyo.

23:36.550 --> 23:39.251
Learn how to surf.

23:39.253 --> 23:41.386
I want three kids.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.321
Two girls and a boy.

23:46.725 --> 23:48.259
How about you?

23:50.595 --> 23:52.997
I don't know, actually.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.566
I've always been fighting to survive.

23:55.568 --> 23:59.470
Never thought about how I'd
wanna live if I had the option.

24:03.308 --> 24:06.710
Never had dreams like that.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.281
John?

24:13.084 --> 24:15.585

- You killed him!
- John. Not me, those above me.

25:56.485 --> 26:00.320
They wanted that for you. I stopped them.

26:00.322 --> 26:03.556
Now, I know this is a hard lesson,
kid, but you're gonna be okay.

26:05.260 --> 26:07.594
Come here. You're gonna be okay.

26:17.371 --> 26:18.438
John.

26:22.042 --> 26:25.645
John. John, please.

26:25.647 --> 26:28.580
Open your eyes. John, can you hear me?

26:57.510 --> 26:58.577
Cara.

26:58.579 --> 27:01.413
Astrid? What's going on?

27:01.415 --> 27:04.015
I need your help.

27:04.017 --> 27:06.584
It's John. He's been shot.

27:11.924 --> 27:14.993
- What were you thinking?
- I know. I screwed up.

27:14.995 --> 27:17.995
That is an understatement!
He could have died out there.

27:17.997 --> 27:20.998
- I'm sorry!
- Did you come on this trip just to sabotage it?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
No, no. It was an accident.

27:23.002 --> 27:25.202
He's a good guy. You never
even gave him a chance.

27:25.204 --> 27:28.573
- I thought that he was trying...
- To what?

27:28.575 --> 27:32.977
Replace your father? This is
the last time I wanna say this.

27:32.979 --> 27:35.979
Your father is never coming back, okay?

27:35.981 --> 27:38.047
- He can't.
- How do you know that?

27:38.049 --> 27:40.984
I know he left a hole in
our lives when he went away,

27:40.986 --> 27:43.019
but you have got to
give me some credit here.

27:43.021 --> 27:46.022
I have kept you and Luca safe for 10 years.

27:46.024 --> 27:48.224
I have shielded you from
things you cannot even imagine

27:48.226 --> 27:52.728
and now we have the chance
to be happy. All of us.

27:52.730 --> 27:57.433
I need this! Luca needs
this. It's just not fair.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.511
They're gonna find us.

28:11.347 --> 28:13.448
We're in the supply
room on the ninth floor.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.650
Once they're done searching the
rooms, they're gonna find us.

28:15.802 --> 28:17.435
Astrid, I need you to breathe.

28:17.437 --> 28:18.871
Tell me where the bullet went in.

28:18.873 --> 28:23.775
I can't even see. There's
so much blood. Um...

28:23.777 --> 28:27.379
It looks like it went below his rib.

28:27.381 --> 28:28.613
Yeah, it's just above the hip.

28:33.018 --> 28:35.719
Have you done this before? Do
you have any medical experience?

28:35.721 --> 28:38.389
No, but I have some help.

28:38.391 --> 28:42.960
I've pulled up all that I could on
human anatomy, surgery, and triage.

28:45.630 --> 28:47.498
You're doing great, Astrid.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.567
Astrid's estimation of the
bullet's trajectory suggests

28:50.569 --> 28:53.370
that no major organs were struck.

28:53.372 --> 28:55.839
However, if I could inquire
about the exit wound...

28:55.841 --> 28:57.911
Astrid, I need you to tell
me where the bullet came out.

28:57.912 --> 28:59.068
Can you roll him over?

29:04.282 --> 29:05.315
There's nothing.

29:06.450 --> 29:08.451
No hole.

29:08.453 --> 29:10.954
So if the bullet didn't come out...

29:10.956 --> 29:12.956
I'm afraid Astrid must remove it.

29:24.771 --> 29:26.370
Can you see if there's
a sewing kit somewhere?

29:26.372 --> 29:28.973
Yes. Yes.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.874
You're going to have to
remove the bullet by hand.

29:30.876 --> 29:32.509
Can you get your hands on any alcohol?

29:34.613 --> 29:37.013
It's just like when you
dissected a frog in biology class.

29:37.015 --> 29:40.384
I was a vegetarian. I did it online.

29:41.653 --> 29:43.820
No one can teleport in
or out of the building

29:43.822 --> 29:45.021
without showing up on our feed.

29:45.023 --> 29:46.957
We found footage of the target's escape.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.959
She seems to be guarded by a paranormal,

29:48.961 --> 29:51.027
and that they're holed
up somewhere in the hotel.

29:51.029 --> 29:54.064
Well, looks like it's over, John.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.333
Time to come home.

30:00.037 --> 30:01.805
We're all clear on this
floor. Going up to the next.

30:01.807 --> 30:02.838
What's your status?

30:05.542 --> 30:08.043
- There's so much blood.
- You can do this, Astrid.

30:08.045 --> 30:10.480
You're gonna go into the hole
with your thumb and index finger.

30:10.482 --> 30:12.081
On the count of three. Are you ready?

30:12.083 --> 30:14.817
One, two, three.

30:23.427 --> 30:24.693
Can you feel the bullet?

30:28.431 --> 30:29.731
They're getting closer.

30:30.733 --> 30:32.034
The bullet, can you feel it?

30:32.036 --> 30:35.437
I think so. Yeah.

30:35.439 --> 30:36.638
Pull it out.

30:47.550 --> 30:49.017
Hang tight, I'm coming to get you.

30:49.019 --> 30:51.520
You can't teleport in, they'll spot you.

30:51.522 --> 30:53.021
I'm not. I'm teleporting out.

31:05.868 --> 31:08.703
No, there's no one in or out, ma'am.
The hotel's on lockdown. I'm sorry.

31:10.071 --> 31:11.405
Me too.

31:50.544 --> 31:52.044
- John.
- Cara, what are you doing?

31:52.046 --> 31:54.113
It's okay. You're gonna
be okay. Take my arm!

31:58.051 --> 32:00.486
Damn it! Okay, I can only
take you one at a time.

32:00.488 --> 32:02.121
Take her. Look, Cara,

32:04.758 --> 32:06.392
there's no coming back.

32:06.394 --> 32:08.660
John, you know I don't like being
told what I can and can't do.

32:24.477 --> 32:26.077
- What are we doing?
- Just follow me.

32:26.079 --> 32:27.579
Why didn't we just teleport?

32:27.581 --> 32:30.348
I'll explain everything later.
Right now I need you to trust me.

32:30.350 --> 32:31.349
Hey!

32:46.098 --> 32:47.098
Nice!

32:49.568 --> 32:51.368
What am I supposed to do with that?

32:51.370 --> 32:52.503
You'll figure it out.

33:13.858 --> 33:16.427
There, someone just teleported out.

33:16.429 --> 33:18.662
Sir, our guys on the
ground tell us she got away.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.097
I thought you said John was
wounded in the initial exchange.

33:21.099 --> 33:25.034
He wasn't the one who helped
the target teleport out.

33:25.036 --> 33:27.838
Well, that means he's still in
the building. Keep searching.

33:36.413 --> 33:37.646
Come on.

33:37.648 --> 33:39.015
Where are we?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.783
- Where's John?
- I'm going back for him.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.818
No, no, no, you can't! It's too late.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.087
I teleported from the
other side of the building.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.488
Hopefully that bought a couple seconds.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.723
- I can get back in, I can get him.
- Cara! They'll kill you.

33:47.725 --> 33:49.658
I'm not gonna waste time arguing with you!

33:54.664 --> 33:56.131
Welcome to our world.

34:13.782 --> 34:16.351
- Damn it, you're stubborn.
- Well, I'm in charge now, remember?

34:37.184 --> 34:39.385
No, I understand.

34:40.420 --> 34:43.222
Space is good.

34:47.293 --> 34:51.563
It's okay. All right. Bye, Peter.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.134
Hey, I put all the gear away.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.572
I'm sorry, Mom.

35:00.574 --> 35:03.608
And I know that I blew it with Peter.

35:03.610 --> 35:05.644
I didn't mean to scare him away.

35:05.646 --> 35:08.113
I should've given him a real chance.

35:08.115 --> 35:10.649
I could go talk to him and apologize...

35:10.651 --> 35:11.650
No.

35:15.354 --> 35:17.189
No more secrets, okay?

35:17.191 --> 35:21.359
No more lies. I need to know
what's going on with you.

35:24.129 --> 35:25.230
You promise?

35:27.433 --> 35:28.667
I promise.

35:32.037 --> 35:35.439
- Be back soon.
- Where you going?

35:35.441 --> 35:39.043
I just, um, Astrid needs
my help with something.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.545
I won't be long, okay?

35:44.083 --> 35:46.398
Hey. We need to talk.

35:46.399 --> 35:48.619
Seriously, about what
happened this weekend.

35:49.288 --> 35:52.389
All right, when I get back.
Just... hang out with Mom.

35:52.391 --> 35:54.425
Don't let her be alone tonight, all right?

36:05.103 --> 36:08.238
Astrid. I'm sorry. I got
here as fast as I could.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.639
Can you take me home now?

36:13.044 --> 36:14.244
I can't.

36:14.246 --> 36:16.179
My parents, they're
gonna be worried about me.

36:16.181 --> 36:17.680
I will take care of your parents, okay?

36:17.682 --> 36:20.015
The important thing is
that you are safe here.

36:20.017 --> 36:22.518
No, I have to talk to my dad.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.754
He's gonna be freaking
out. I have to talk to him.

36:24.756 --> 36:27.490
Okay. Okay, come on.

36:29.960 --> 36:33.028
Uh... yeah, the audition went really well.

36:33.030 --> 36:37.499
I was out celebrating so I only
just realized how late it was.

36:38.601 --> 36:40.670
Uh, yeah, I'm excited.

36:41.052 --> 36:47.189
No, I'm not crying, I'm just shaking,
'cause I can't believe how lucky I am.

36:48.980 --> 36:50.552
Yeah, it's everything I ever dreamed of.

36:51.617 --> 36:53.183
Thanks for believing in me, Dad.

36:56.288 --> 36:59.189
Will you hug Mom for me,
and tell her I love her?

37:00.759 --> 37:03.727
I love you both. Bye.

37:09.267 --> 37:12.235
I've never lied to him before.

37:12.237 --> 37:14.771
The more he knows, the more
dangerous it is for him.

37:19.944 --> 37:21.678
I thought these would be more comfortable.

37:25.081 --> 37:26.982
How long do I have to stay here for?

37:32.255 --> 37:34.757
Stephen?

37:34.759 --> 37:36.125
Until it's safe.

37:37.294 --> 37:39.962
And when will that be, exactly?

37:39.964 --> 37:43.999
What, like, tomorrow? Monday? Longer?

37:45.101 --> 37:46.735
However long it takes.

37:48.872 --> 37:50.706
So, what, you're gonna keep me hostage?

37:50.708 --> 37:52.975
No, of course not.

37:54.144 --> 37:56.712
But you have to let us protect you.

37:56.714 --> 37:59.280
You're the reason I need
protection in the first place.

38:08.190 --> 38:09.257
Yeah.

38:16.932 --> 38:20.101
Please, don't get up.

38:20.103 --> 38:22.036
Laughing hurts.

38:23.805 --> 38:28.942
Thank you, John. If it wasn't
for you, Astrid would be dead.

38:28.944 --> 38:30.244
How was the camping trip?

38:31.813 --> 38:34.214
It was a different kind of bloodbath.

38:35.650 --> 38:37.518
Look, I never should've left.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.687
I mean, you took a bullet for her.

38:40.889 --> 38:42.890
I told you I'd protect her and I did.

38:42.892 --> 38:46.293
Yeah, I know, but you
took it to another level.

38:49.264 --> 38:50.530
Sit down.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.216
Sometimes, when we try to protect someone,

39:10.218 --> 39:12.485
we wind up putting them
in even more danger.

39:13.721 --> 39:16.923
You couldn't have known.
You did the right thing.

39:19.092 --> 39:21.961
We can't always control
how things turn out.

39:25.799 --> 39:27.233
Who are you?

39:27.235 --> 39:28.567
I work here.

39:30.137 --> 39:33.072
And you look like you could
use someone to talk to.

39:33.074 --> 39:35.707
The people I talk to end up dead.

39:35.709 --> 39:38.877
You should stay away from me
if you know what's best for you.

39:41.047 --> 39:43.048
It's okay to have secrets, you know.

39:43.050 --> 39:45.884
You just have to be careful
who you share them with.

39:45.886 --> 39:48.720
You can tell me anything you want.

39:48.722 --> 39:53.124
I think you and I are destined
to be great friends, John.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.129
What makes you say that?

39:58.131 --> 39:59.764
I just have a feeling.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.269
Why are you being so nice to me?

40:06.638 --> 40:11.175
I have a little boy. A little
bit younger than you are.

40:11.177 --> 40:16.681
And, uh, well... someday, he
might need you to be nice to him.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.149
And I may not be around.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.154
I'm Roger, by the way.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.291
Remember,

40:27.293 --> 40:29.026
it's always darkest...

40:29.028 --> 40:31.728
Just before... you turn on the lights.

40:33.664 --> 40:36.233
Yeah, he used to say that to me too.

40:39.073 --> 40:43.009
So, what happened with
your mom's boyfriend?

40:43.011 --> 40:45.879
There were times that I was
sure he was using his powers.

40:45.881 --> 40:48.247
Objects that had to have been TK'd.

40:48.249 --> 40:53.452
- But when I forced his hand...
- Wait, what do you mean, forced his hand?

40:53.454 --> 40:57.223
Um... I might have accidentally
shoved him off a cliff.

40:57.315 --> 40:58.447
What?

40:58.449 --> 41:00.283
Yeah.

41:00.285 --> 41:03.252
If he has powers, he's willing
to die to keep them a secret.

41:03.254 --> 41:05.420
Well, maybe it wasn't him using powers.

41:05.422 --> 41:07.054
Well, it wasn't me.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.024
Who else was there?

41:10.026 --> 41:12.527
No one. It was just me, my mom, and my...

41:16.098 --> 41:17.399
my brother.

41:23.272 --> 41:28.075
Youngest son of the most powerful
Tomorrow Person. It makes sense.

41:28.077 --> 41:30.912
That's why he was trying to talk to me.

41:30.914 --> 41:32.880
Very high genetic probability.

41:34.549 --> 41:36.550
I'm so stupid. How did I miss it?

41:37.985 --> 41:39.586
It's Luca.

41:39.588 --> 41:41.588
He's breaking out.
