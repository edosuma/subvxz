11:36.096 --> 11:38.298
I get the feeling that he's
not going to leave me alone.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.300
And I'd like him
out of my life.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.905
Why do I get the feeling

11:44.938 --> 11:46.339
you're not telling me
everything?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.449

how can I help you?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.518
I understand, ma'am.
Where was this?

11:58.551 --> 12:00.020
MAN: Where in upstate
New York?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.455
PATRICK: No, sir,
she wasn't missing last month

12:02.489 --> 12:04.224
but thank you for your call.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.426
You know, Patrick,
sometimes I wonder

12:06.459 --> 12:07.460
what's going on in your head.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.897
To be honest, most of the time
I feel the same way.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.164
You punched out Marty Stein.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.066
Were you going to tell me?

12:13.100 --> 12:14.267
-It was personal.
-Personal?

12:15.803 --> 12:17.337
Yeah, well, you can expect
personal service

12:17.370 --> 12:18.772
with an assault complaint.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.207
Ah, you're shitting me.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.274
No, I wish I was.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.911
Captain Lockwood down at the
Fourth just called me.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.179
Fuck it.
Son of a bitch deserved it.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.514
Maybe he did.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.917
But he's Mia's, or Anna,
whatever the fuck

12:29.950 --> 12:31.484
her name is today,
he is her lawyer.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.453
And that puts you puts you
in a conflict situation.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.788
-Okay. Hold on.
-No, no.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.423
You are off the investigation.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.125
-Come on.
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

12:38.158 --> 12:39.993
Come... For fuck's sake!

12:43.563 --> 12:46.333
We usually have three
or four temp nurses here

12:46.366 --> 12:47.968
on any given shift.

12:48.001 --> 12:51.471
One of the regulars is sick,
on vacation, you get the idea.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.240
Anyway, uh,

12:53.273 --> 12:57.344
Jasmine, the nurse who usually
works the shift and wing

12:57.377 --> 13:00.814
where Maria Alvarado was
staying, was out last night.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.083
-Is she sick?
-Oh, I hope not.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.117
She's on her honeymoon.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.453
How do you find the temps?

13:06.486 --> 13:09.356
The hospital has a contract
with an agency.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.824
-MNA.
-Okay.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.792
-Medical Nursing Agency.
-Okay.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.930
Do we have a home address
for Dominique Lacour?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.999
She's the temp
who worked last night.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.501
NURSE: I've got
nothing on file.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.007
Print out the information
on MNA for Detective Annou.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.912
NANCY: Well, we scrutinize
every nurse's work history,

13:32.279 --> 13:35.348
and require several
recommendations on each one.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.517
We've never had any complaints
on Dominique before.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.585
Personally, I think...

13:40.153 --> 13:41.321
Oh, that's odd.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.422
What?

13:43.390 --> 13:44.424
Dominique wasn't sent
to Mayfield last night.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.559
We sent Jill DeCarlo.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.295
Okay, can you get her
on the phone for me?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.863
Absolutely.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.364
I don't like this any more
than you do, Detective.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.437
Hi Jill.
It's Nancy from MNA...

13:58.471 --> 13:59.439
No, not today.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.009
Listen, actually, I have
a police detective here

14:02.042 --> 14:03.310

speak to you.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.557
It's fine. It's fine.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.426
Listen, Nancy's telling me
that you were assigned

14:19.459 --> 14:21.528
to Mayfield last night but...

14:25.966 --> 14:27.901
Can you e-mail that to Nancy?

14:27.935 --> 14:28.936
Thank you.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.939
She's saying your office sent
her a cancellation e-mail.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.541
No way.
It would be here if we did.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.543
Uh, I'll call you back
in a minute.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.982

you have on Dominique Lacour.

-Shit, I ain't done nothin'.
-Yeah?

15:06.139 --> 15:08.041

to buy those kicks.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.213
-I forget.
-Forgot?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.447
Maybe I should
take you downtown.

-You wanna go downtown?
-Oh, come on, man.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.250

work something out.

I did. And the prison pharmacy

doesn't even carry Coumadin,
which is what you gave her.

the pharmacist gave me.

I spoke to him.

given you Coumadin.

-No.

No. No, he would never
do anything like that.

go for AT&T Park.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.350
not with lawyers like that.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.617
Not yet.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.621
Are you eating
a bacon burger from Billy's?

38:10.556 --> 38:12.924
It creeps me out how you can
smell food through the phone.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.660
Food's my porn.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.495
Will you save me half?

38:17.763 --> 38:20.065
All right, who caught
the nursing home case?

38:20.098 --> 38:21.500
Hold on a sec.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.505
That would be

38:26.538 --> 38:28.507
Detective Colleen Morrison.

38:29.775 --> 38:30.776
Mmm...

38:33.144 --> 38:35.581
Retired three years ago. July.

That is the same time that

38:37.048 --> 38:39.518

was ruled an accident.

it'd be a democracy,

39:08.714 --> 39:10.549
but it's really
more like a Ricktatorship.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.618
One minute, he's this
law-abiding sheriff

39:12.651 --> 39:14.853
and now he's a cold,
remorseless killer.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.156
Oh, here's another
interesting tidbit.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.891
They never say the word
"zombie" once.

39:19.925 --> 39:23.128
There's walkers,
biters, floaters,

39:23.161 --> 39:25.363
with humans being
the deadliest of them all.

No, keep going.

I'm sorry.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.476
I didn't mean to ramble.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.412
It's just so nice
to have someone to talk to.

39:40.446 --> 39:43.849
I'm sorry.
I'm just preoccupied.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.821
So, who's in San Fran,
if you don't mind me asking?

39:50.856 --> 39:53.625
Just an old girlfriend.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.862
Ever been before?

39:58.464 --> 39:59.698
Before this morning,

39:59.731 --> 40:01.667
I've never been
out of Nebraska.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.872
You know,
I'm ahead of schedule.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.475
I don't have to go to
Seattle right away.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.143
My conference doesn't
start until Monday.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.981
If your girlfriend's busy
working or whatever,

40:16.014 --> 40:18.884
I mean, I could
show you around.

40:21.553 --> 40:22.854
Are you okay?

40:22.888 --> 40:23.889
You're sweating.

40:24.756 --> 40:25.757
Oh.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.527
I'm just really hot.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.102
You like frozen smoothies?

40:37.135 --> 40:39.037
Blueberry is my favorite.

40:41.707 --> 40:42.741
Tell you what.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.143
I'll fill up

Just Colleen.
I'll be right with you.

Oh, Jesus, I thought I was
done with you people.

Colleen, I'm so sorry
to bother you.

of an 18-year-old girl,

is a nurse that you arrested

before you started
cutting flowers.

remembered this one.

42:55.306 --> 42:56.842
Why's that?

42:56.875 --> 42:58.677
Because it was
one of your last cases.

Sorry.

get paid for.

out if a liquor license

was obtained through nefarious
means and my career,

44:54.325 --> 44:55.761
the choice isn't close.

44:55.794 --> 44:57.763
It's not just about a license.

44:58.129 --> 45:00.398
Look, Oaks just made me
his bagman.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.868
I just delivered $50,000
to some asshole

45:02.901 --> 45:04.402

-For what?
-I don't know.

in the Sunset District.

a woman came out.

-I figure she has the money.
-Did you follow her?

45:12.343 --> 45:13.879
No, I got a plate number.

Look, if I can figure out who
Oaks is paying and why,

45:17.415 --> 45:19.250
that gives me leverage.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.153
Maybe I can get out
from under him.

Oh, fuck.

Do me a favor, lose my number.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.235
I am trying to do
the right thing.

45:37.803 --> 45:39.537
Look, I've done a lot
of bad shit in my life,

45:39.570 --> 45:41.372
things I'm not proud of.
All right?

45:41.406 --> 45:43.141
Things I wish
I could take back.

45:43.942 --> 45:45.010

But there's no taking back
in this world.

45:46.111 --> 45:47.112
I understand.

45:47.312 --> 45:48.947
But, all I want to do

45:48.980 --> 45:51.282
is I want to sit in my bar
and serve drinks

45:51.316 --> 45:54.285
to other damaged souls
that are trying to forget.

45:54.319 --> 45:57.222
But this piece of shit cop
won't let me do it.

a warrior for justice,

46:09.567 --> 46:10.936
you know what she says to me?

"Nah, I'm too busy
for you, Ethan."

46:12.170 --> 46:13.238
Come on, Regan.

46:14.973 --> 46:15.974
Help me out.

46:25.283 --> 46:26.284
All right.

46:27.853 --> 46:28.854
Okay.

46:33.391 --> 46:34.960
You should have
finished law school.

46:34.993 --> 46:35.994
Huh?

46:36.895 --> 46:38.396
You'd have made
a hell of a trial lawyer.

46:38.864 --> 46:39.865
Hmm.

Let's not jump the gun.

47:10.061 --> 47:12.230
It could be a case of
wrong place, wrong time.

47:12.430 --> 47:14.165
Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

47:14.199 --> 47:15.533
No. But do you have any idea

47:15.566 --> 47:17.969
how hard it is
to prove a cop is dirty?

47:18.003 --> 47:20.138
Let alone two dirty cops.

47:20.438 --> 47:22.640
That blue line
is thick, Ethan.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.176
If I step on the wrong toes,
my career is over.

47:25.376 --> 47:27.378
I need the SFPD to win cases.

47:27.412 --> 47:30.115
And if I'm right
and we prove it,

47:30.148 --> 47:32.050
what happens to
your career then?

47:32.951 --> 47:34.019
I mean, this could be a whole

47:34.052 --> 47:36.587
hell of a lot bigger than
just two dirty cops, Regan.

47:43.161 --> 47:44.329
Okay.

47:44.963 --> 47:46.064
I'll look into Oaks.

47:48.934 --> 47:50.135
That's Oaks.

47:51.169 --> 47:52.337
And that's her.

47:53.204 --> 47:55.173
-Can I hang onto these?
-Sure. Yeah.

47:56.107 --> 47:57.108
Yeah.

48:00.078 --> 48:01.346
Thanks, Regan.

The clerk's Troy Varrone.

Poor kid just got
the job last week.

48:38.716 --> 48:39.951
And this one?

48:39.985 --> 48:41.219
His name is Ron Wakefield.

48:41.252 --> 48:42.720
He's the one who
called your hotline.

48:42.753 --> 48:45.556
On the way to Seattle for
a pharmaceutical conference.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.525
PATRICK: Looks like he thought
he was getting lucky.

48:48.359 --> 48:50.095
What about
the security footage?

48:50.128 --> 48:51.329
We're a small town.

48:51.562 --> 48:54.199
No cameras? You're kidding?

48:54.232 --> 48:56.367
This sort of thing
doesn't happen here.

48:56.401 --> 48:58.103
Officers are canvassing
the area.

48:58.136 --> 48:59.304
And?

48:59.337 --> 49:01.239
No one's been able
to ID your girl.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.440
She killed my partner.

49:02.707 --> 49:03.708
She's not my girl.

49:08.246 --> 49:10.715
What about this
poor schmuck's vehicle?

49:10.748 --> 49:11.649
We haven't found it yet,

49:11.682 --> 49:15.320
but we were able to get into
his phone's GPS.

49:15.353 --> 49:17.288
He was headed to Seattle.
Originally.

49:18.023 --> 49:20.158
About 20 minutes before
he pulled over to fill up,

49:20.191 --> 49:22.393
he reset his GPS
for San Francisco.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.400
CLEA: You should have seen
Colleen's face

49:29.434 --> 49:31.402
when I mentioned
Dominique's name.

49:31.436 --> 49:32.570
I thought she was gonna shit.

49:35.073 --> 49:36.574
She fucking knows something.

49:38.376 --> 49:40.678
Maybe she fucked up something
with Dominique's first case.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.150
Maybe she was
pressured off the force.

49:52.123 --> 49:54.325
Is that half of your bacon
burger still in the fridge?

49:54.625 --> 49:56.394
With your name on it.

49:56.427 --> 49:57.628
I'll get it for you.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.430
I need a coffee anyway.

50:03.268 --> 50:05.603
I think we should
talk to her last partner.

50:17.315 --> 50:18.583
What the fuck?

50:19.084 --> 50:20.485
Look at this.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.189
Casey Oaks.

50:24.555 --> 50:26.757
Isn't that the guy who came
into Maria's interrogation?

50:29.860 --> 50:33.231
That's one big fucking
coincidence, if you ask me.
