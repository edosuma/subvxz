31:32.708 --> 31:35.083
Then came the first
of the search parties.

31:36.833 --> 31:38.458
Took four of my kin.

32:06.833 --> 32:08.208
Honey.

32:08.291 --> 32:10.041
Those boys are as good as out,
okay?

32:29.291 --> 32:30.999
- All right?
- Yeah, yeah.

32:43.208 --> 32:45.208
I can hear them over there.

32:47.083 --> 32:49.583
- Where?
- There. That way.

32:52.958 --> 32:54.708
- Hush. Shh!
- Dad?

33:01.041 --> 33:02.708
It was louder before.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.541
Boys?

33:05.208 --> 33:06.208
Boys?

33:08.625 --> 33:09.667
Boys?

33:13.833 --> 33:14.875
Boys?

33:15.541 --> 33:16.875
Dad!

33:16.958 --> 33:19.541
♪

33:19.625 --> 33:23.166
Boys? Follow the sounds
of our voices.

33:23.249 --> 33:24.541
Dad!

33:25.083 --> 33:27.291
Boys? Can you hear us?

33:27.750 --> 33:28.750
Dad?

33:29.291 --> 33:30.750
We're here, boys.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.041
Dad, where are you?

33:32.124 --> 33:34.333
John, George, we're here.

33:34.416 --> 33:36.291
♪

33:36.375 --> 33:39.583
John? George, Daddy's coming.

33:44.416 --> 33:47.416
You all right?

33:54.249 --> 33:55.667
They all died?

33:55.750 --> 33:57.041
Not right away.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.166
But they were trapped.

34:00.249 --> 34:02.958
No food, no water, no way out.

34:04.917 --> 34:07.375
So, you imagine for yourselves
what it must have been like

34:07.458 --> 34:10.291
for those people
to waste away in there,

34:10.375 --> 34:12.875
how long it would have taken
for them to...

34:12.958 --> 34:15.416
give up the ghost one by one.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.833
There must have been
other search parties.

34:19.166 --> 34:20.249
Indeed, there was.

34:21.875 --> 34:23.750
But the only thing any of them
could do

34:23.833 --> 34:25.541
is try to figure out
the most likely place

34:25.625 --> 34:28.249
where that rockfall had...
Had sealed them in.

34:29.792 --> 34:33.124
See, back then...

34:33.208 --> 34:36.625
nobody could figure out
how to get to the other side

34:36.708 --> 34:39.208
of those rocks
without blasting it.

34:39.291 --> 34:42.083
Then, the whole
cave system collapse.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.583
So...

34:46.667 --> 34:51.333
there they still lie.
Thirty-four men and boys,

34:51.416 --> 34:55.583
including my grandfather
and his three brothers,

34:55.667 --> 34:58.416
which is how come I can give you
chapter and verse on that event,

34:58.500 --> 35:00.500
whilst most people
around here cannot.

35:01.917 --> 35:04.041
I'm sorry for your family.

35:04.124 --> 35:08.416
Yeah, you ask me where my people
are buried around here?

35:08.500 --> 35:10.541
That goddamn hellhole's gotta be

35:10.625 --> 35:12.833
the biggest Bolton family plot
in the state.

35:19.041 --> 35:20.833
So, you say the system
is sealed.

35:22.208 --> 35:23.416
So, there's no way in?

35:23.500 --> 35:25.917
There's an old souvenir shop
that you had to go through

35:25.999 --> 35:30.500
to get into the caves, but...
the state, they cemented it up

35:30.583 --> 35:34.166
right after the last
of the search parties got out.

35:34.249 --> 35:37.166
Now, these local shitbirds
been breaking it down,

35:37.249 --> 35:39.541
so they can get in there,
they can get high,

35:39.625 --> 35:42.124
make babies
with their underage sweethearts.

35:42.208 --> 35:49.333
Can you perhaps just show me
where that is on this?

35:49.416 --> 35:53.124
Well, no.
Not on this little dinky thing.

35:53.208 --> 35:55.458
You gotta be able to give us
some kind of idea.

35:55.541 --> 35:56.541
Hold on.

36:02.958 --> 36:07.124
We found him. He's in there.

36:07.208 --> 36:10.416
That's the good news and
the bad news at the same time.

36:15.917 --> 36:17.291
- Right about here.
- Mm-hm.

36:17.375 --> 36:20.333
Unless it's been blown away
by a strong wind this week,

36:20.416 --> 36:23.958
and the parking lot
is right here.

36:24.041 --> 36:26.416
Just a baby step away.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.875
Now, there was a back entrance
that the rescuers used,

36:29.958 --> 36:33.166
but, uh, another cave-in
coming off a little earthquake

36:33.249 --> 36:35.124
we had a few years ago
took care of that.

36:42.958 --> 36:46.416
Y'all are thinkin',
"Yeah, we got this thing now."

36:47.208 --> 36:48.917
It's in the cave, waitin'.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.291
Well,
maybe it's waiting for you.

36:53.541 --> 36:55.041
You think of that?

36:55.124 --> 36:58.500
Well, you know, we just have
to confirm its whereabouts,

36:58.583 --> 37:00.333
and then,
we call in the cavalry.

37:00.416 --> 37:02.708
We're not taking the fight
to it.

37:02.792 --> 37:05.375
Yeah, what you gonna tell
that cavalry?

37:05.458 --> 37:06.958
We don't have to say anything,

37:07.041 --> 37:11.291
but the man who tried to snatch
a boy on the midway...

37:12.333 --> 37:13.375
he's in that cave.

37:13.458 --> 37:15.708
What if it gets past you?

37:15.792 --> 37:19.166
Gets past them? Since they know
less about it than you do.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.750
It gonna come for my brother
next?

37:22.833 --> 37:26.041
My brother who don't know
a goddamn thing about shit,

37:26.124 --> 37:28.083
'cause y'all don't think
that's such a good idea?

37:28.750 --> 37:30.750
I back my colleague...

37:35.500 --> 37:36.500
Chicken.

37:45.166 --> 37:47.500
- I should have called first.
- Come in.

37:55.166 --> 37:56.166
Hi, come on.

37:57.833 --> 38:00.166
I didn't drive down
here in the middle of the night

38:00.249 --> 38:01.375
just to babysit.

38:01.458 --> 38:04.500
You came down here to help,
which I appreciate,

38:04.583 --> 38:06.792
and this is the best way
to do it.

38:06.875 --> 38:09.041
I only have today, you know.

38:09.124 --> 38:11.416
In the morning, I have to go
back and join the real world.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.667
Howie, we're gonna be back
in a couple of hours.

38:15.041 --> 38:16.249
I appreciate it.

38:16.333 --> 38:18.917
Hey, I'm thinking we take
two cars, if anything gets weird

38:18.999 --> 38:21.208
- or if we need to split up.
- Yeah, sounds good.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.708
I was
at the county building today,

38:26.792 --> 38:28.875
and I ran into DA Hayes
in the hallway.

38:30.083 --> 38:32.458
He asked if he could have
a word with me in private,

38:32.541 --> 38:36.166
but since he's a plaintiff
in one of my lawsuits,

38:36.249 --> 38:38.083
I told him
it wasn't a good idea.

38:38.166 --> 38:39.458
You think he's gonna try

38:39.541 --> 38:40.792
and talk you into dropping it?

38:40.875 --> 38:41.958
That's the funny thing,

38:42.041 --> 38:43.583
he didn't give off
that impression.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.333
He seemed much more subdued

38:46.416 --> 38:48.500
than the other times
I've seen him actually.

38:48.583 --> 38:50.500
- Kind of hangdog?
- Yeah.

38:51.333 --> 38:52.375
How did you know?

38:53.208 --> 38:54.541
Just a hunch.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.958
Now I half wish
I had let him speak to me.

39:04.792 --> 39:07.958
I was so angry at you
for dragging me to that meeting

39:08.041 --> 39:09.792
at your so-called
investigator's.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.249
I know you were.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.875
To hear her spout
all that crazy shit...

39:16.792 --> 39:18.083
felt like a setup.

39:18.166 --> 39:19.750
No, I had no idea
what she was gonna say

39:19.833 --> 39:21.792
until the words started
coming out of her mouth.

39:21.875 --> 39:22.792
No one did.

39:22.875 --> 39:24.541
But you bought right into it.

39:24.625 --> 39:25.750
Yeah, I did.

39:26.625 --> 39:27.708
I still do.

39:29.249 --> 39:30.541
So do a lot of the others.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.166
I would say to you

39:35.249 --> 39:37.541
that they're putting themselves
in harm's way

39:37.625 --> 39:38.792
for their convictions,

39:38.875 --> 39:40.291
but then
I'd have to explain to you

39:40.375 --> 39:41.458
the how and the why of it,

39:41.541 --> 39:45.375
and forgive me for saying this,
but right now...

39:45.458 --> 39:47.333
I don't know
if I have the strength

39:47.416 --> 39:48.999
to deal with your reaction.

39:50.958 --> 39:54.416
I came over here because as
painful as that meeting was...

39:57.291 --> 39:58.999
I didn't want it to destroy

39:59.083 --> 40:01.124
any of the goodwill
there was between us.

40:03.458 --> 40:06.667
You've never been anything
but kind to me and my girls.

40:09.958 --> 40:13.792
And even though I refuse
to accept anything

40:13.875 --> 40:17.833
around this... Cuco thing...

40:21.625 --> 40:22.958
I just want you to know that...

40:25.166 --> 40:27.667
I respect the sincerity
of your beliefs.

40:30.375 --> 40:31.458
Well, thank you.

40:39.958 --> 40:41.583
I noticed you drop
the conditional

40:41.667 --> 40:42.708
when you talk about it.

40:44.875 --> 40:48.083
You don't say
"If this thing is real" anymore.

40:48.166 --> 40:49.750
"If it's trying to become
Claude,"

40:49.833 --> 40:53.708
"If it's truly capable of
hopping from person to person."

40:54.375 --> 40:55.458
Yep.

40:56.917 --> 40:58.583
Guess my sense
of what's rational

40:58.667 --> 41:01.291
just got tired and left town.

41:01.375 --> 41:03.333
And how is that sitting
with you?

41:03.416 --> 41:04.541
Oh, I...

41:05.875 --> 41:08.166
It makes me sick to my stomach,

41:08.249 --> 41:12.291
'cause if I have to believe
that a thing like that

41:12.375 --> 41:15.375
- can exist in the world...
- You take small bites.

41:18.875 --> 41:20.792
It's just the reality
of this thing,

41:20.875 --> 41:24.333
it upends everything. It means
everything we ever believed in,

41:24.416 --> 41:26.893
- everything we've come
to an understanding...
- Hey, Ralph. Ralph.

41:26.917 --> 41:27.999
What? What? What?

41:28.833 --> 41:30.041
You take small bites.

41:31.750 --> 41:32.833
You accept what you can

41:32.917 --> 41:34.958
to keep your shit together
and nothing more,

41:35.041 --> 41:37.333
until you're ready
for another bite. That's it.

41:40.583 --> 41:43.750
We're talking about containing
this thing

41:43.833 --> 41:45.500
- until the troops arrive.
- Yeah.

41:45.583 --> 41:49.208
What if it doesn't cotton
to being contained? Then what?

41:50.541 --> 41:52.750
Then we kill it
before it can kill us.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.416
What if it can't be killed?

41:56.041 --> 41:57.708
Yeah, we're back to that again.

42:00.166 --> 42:01.750
Small bites, my ass.

42:10.750 --> 42:11.750
Shit.

42:12.667 --> 42:14.583
What you hit that with,
gunpowder?

42:18.416 --> 42:20.875
That take you back
to your dormitory days, does it?

42:21.291 --> 42:22.291
Hm.

42:27.458 --> 42:28.958
Do you think this right?

42:29.792 --> 42:31.458
What's "this"?

42:31.541 --> 42:34.458
Not telling him that
that fucking thing's out there.

42:36.291 --> 42:38.541
What, do you think this is
my tenth rodeo or something?

42:38.625 --> 42:39.958
How the hell should I know?

42:41.833 --> 42:43.083
It's not right.

42:44.792 --> 42:49.792
Listen, how 'bout we just stick
to the game plan. All right?

42:52.917 --> 42:53.958
Thank you.

42:55.583 --> 42:57.833
You mind if I, um...

42:57.917 --> 43:01.166
scrounge around for what's left
of that heavenly chicken?

43:01.249 --> 43:03.291
Heaven chicken. Not heavenly.

43:03.792 --> 43:05.708
I stand corrected.

43:05.792 --> 43:09.208
Yeah. Help yourself.
You paid for it.
