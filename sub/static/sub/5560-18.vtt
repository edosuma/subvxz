WEBVTT

00:01.295 --> 00:03.842
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:03.892 --> 00:06.330
I know there's been
some distance between us.

00:06.387 --> 00:08.429
I'm really happy we're all a family again.

00:08.464 --> 00:09.404
Mom!

00:09.485 --> 00:10.596
Oh, my God.

00:10.631 --> 00:12.088
Dad! Dad!

00:12.194 --> 00:14.136
It took me a while to get here.

00:14.221 --> 00:15.399
Well, I'm glad you're here now.

00:15.434 --> 00:17.507
- Alexandra.
- Bethany.

00:17.542 --> 00:18.628
Very nice to meet you.

00:18.663 --> 00:21.217
<i>Hi, this is Sofia Varma.
Please leave a message.</i>

00:21.287 --> 00:23.496
Hi, uh, it's me again.

00:23.551 --> 00:25.507
I just wanted to know that you're okay.

00:25.563 --> 00:28.010
I'm worried about you. Call me.

00:28.045 --> 00:29.142
_

00:29.200 --> 00:31.291
Born Gord Enver.

00:31.369 --> 00:33.556
He changed his name to Rich Dotcom.

00:33.595 --> 00:35.466
Anything you need, he can get it for you

00:35.548 --> 00:38.250
and he's one of the most
dangerous guys in the world.

00:39.119 --> 00:40.453
<i>Put down your weapons!</i>

00:40.512 --> 00:43.365
We are the FBI, and you are under arrest.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.571
Can you believe it?

00:50.649 --> 00:53.194
Four queens in this
place? Ay-yi-yi.

00:53.257 --> 00:55.571
Oh, boy. This is my kinda night.

00:55.649 --> 00:57.084
Go on a little shopping spree
with all these cigarettes,

00:57.155 --> 00:58.631
buy myself something real nice, huh?

00:58.701 --> 00:59.647
All right, who's dealing next?

00:59.702 --> 01:01.068
- That's it.
- Hey!

01:01.103 --> 01:03.336
You gotta be cheating.

01:03.527 --> 01:05.549
I know you didn't just
put your hands on me.

01:05.612 --> 01:07.290
Nobody's that lucky.

01:07.396 --> 01:09.352
No, but thankfully I am that smart,

01:09.427 --> 01:11.443
and you three are the twitchiest,

01:11.498 --> 01:13.485
shiftiest, tellingest convicted felons

01:13.539 --> 01:16.073
in the history of the game of poker.

01:16.213 --> 01:17.340
No wonder you got caught.

01:17.375 --> 01:18.797
What did you just say to me?

01:18.852 --> 01:20.014
You have tells.

01:20.077 --> 01:22.747
Whenever Draco has a bad hand,
he licks his lips... when Kentucky

01:22.809 --> 01:25.212
gets anything remotely
good, he can't stop blinking,

01:25.274 --> 01:26.968
and whenever you have a pocket pair,

01:27.014 --> 01:31.143
you start to wax philosophical about
every murder you ever committed.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.941
So if being the smartest person in the room

01:32.988 --> 01:34.700
and being a master at
reading faces is cheating,

01:34.773 --> 01:36.864
then, yeah, okay, I'm a cheater.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.358
But if you're done wasting my time,

01:38.396 --> 01:40.338
maybe we can get back
to playing some cards.

01:46.543 --> 01:48.401
Okay, um...

01:49.408 --> 01:51.768
Let's just take a... take a breath here.

01:51.803 --> 01:53.603
This is a teachable
moment for me, I get that.

01:53.648 --> 01:55.304
But, um, you know what we could do?

01:55.366 --> 01:58.246
We could teach those hypocrites out
there what it is to be civilized men,

01:58.279 --> 02:00.343
civilized men who use our... uhh!

02:00.393 --> 02:02.369
Get his legs!

02:03.541 --> 02:05.116
I saw you cheat, man!

02:06.587 --> 02:08.996
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

02:09.059 --> 02:11.254
Hey, it's me.

02:11.289 --> 02:12.727
I just talked to the doctor.

02:12.785 --> 02:14.121
It's not good, Sarah.

02:14.212 --> 02:18.124
She says it's about making him
more comfortable at this point,

02:18.220 --> 02:20.623
however you do that in here.

02:21.305 --> 02:24.168
I'll, uh... I'll talk to you later.

02:24.235 --> 02:25.536
Bye.

02:30.346 --> 02:31.906
Can you do anything with it?

02:31.941 --> 02:35.983
It's too pixilated for our facial
recognition software to get a hit.

02:36.058 --> 02:37.285
Do you have the digital file?

02:37.347 --> 02:38.603
Uh-huh.

02:39.751 --> 02:41.147
Your people can't handle this?

02:41.206 --> 02:44.182
I'd like to keep it out
of the system for now.

02:44.261 --> 02:45.905
I'll see what I can do.

02:48.344 --> 02:50.994
It's good to see you.

02:51.057 --> 02:53.748
You've been a bit of a hermit since...

02:55.807 --> 02:57.901
Nothing I don't understand, it's just, I...

02:57.936 --> 03:00.212
It's good to see you too, Marcus.

03:00.274 --> 03:03.773
Maybe we should grab dinner
sometime, like in the old days.

03:03.838 --> 03:05.442
I'd like that.

03:05.523 --> 03:07.690
Let me know about the photo.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.302
I need you to tell Weller
you're having memories,

03:18.337 --> 03:20.664
remembering him, remembering Clairfield.

03:20.769 --> 03:22.031
But I'm... I'm not.

03:22.093 --> 03:22.989
That's what these are for.

03:23.043 --> 03:25.146
Memory will provide him comfort.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.150 --> 03:47.918
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:49.955 --> 03:50.850
I heard about your dad.

03:50.893 --> 03:54.533
Can... Can I... do anything?

03:55.184 --> 03:56.215
No.

03:57.462 --> 04:00.142
I don't think anyone can, no.

04:01.878 --> 04:03.557
He's not gonna beat this.

04:03.592 --> 04:07.333
Well, maybe you can take
me to meet him sometime.

04:09.036 --> 04:10.537
He'll like that.

04:13.509 --> 04:15.177
It's funny, you know...

04:17.466 --> 04:20.039
We only just started
talking to each other again.

04:20.112 --> 04:23.173
It... It's gonna be hard to...

04:29.219 --> 04:32.477
Oh, uh, hey. Sorry.

04:32.531 --> 04:33.809
- Hey.
- I didn't mean to...

04:33.871 --> 04:34.993
It's all right.

04:35.028 --> 04:36.933
Uh, I need to talk to you.

04:37.082 --> 04:38.115
Sure.

04:38.201 --> 04:40.120
Actually, I meant both of you.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.672
Ever since we apprehended Rich Dotcom,

04:44.742 --> 04:46.553
the marshals have been
trying to get him to roll over

04:46.623 --> 04:48.745
on some of his dark web associates,

04:48.808 --> 04:51.018
but he's been less than
cooperative, until today.

04:51.084 --> 04:52.084
What changed?

04:52.150 --> 04:53.233
He got his ass kicked in prison.

04:53.268 --> 04:55.012
That sounds about right.

04:55.093 --> 04:56.509
And now he wants to talk.

04:56.579 --> 04:58.421
Actually, he already started.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.991
He claims he can give us Sho Ahktar.

05:04.427 --> 05:05.959
Does somebody want to catch me up?

05:06.068 --> 05:09.960
Shohid Ahktar, eight on
the FBI's most wanted list.

05:10.038 --> 05:13.635
He's basically the bank for every major
terrorist organization in the world.

05:13.694 --> 05:18.190
Bring him down, we'll cripple
ISIS, Al Qaeda, Dabbur Zann.

05:18.267 --> 05:20.190
We don't even know what Ahktar looks like.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.711
How solid is Dotcom's intel?

05:21.811 --> 05:25.214
The CIA confirmed that Rich has had
dealings with Ahktar in the past,

05:25.249 --> 05:27.387
so I believe him when
he says he can deliver.

05:27.422 --> 05:29.409
But... he's got a condition.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.887
And what is that?

05:31.234 --> 05:33.702
He says he'll only talk to you and Jane.

05:40.566 --> 05:42.437
Holy derby, you two look great.

05:42.472 --> 05:43.633
Wish I could say the same.

05:43.696 --> 05:45.131
What are you saying? I don't look tough?

05:45.205 --> 05:46.373
Are you kidding me? I
got a glimpse of myself

05:46.408 --> 05:47.661
in the window here, I
thought I looked pretty tough.

05:47.696 --> 05:49.806
- I don't look tough?
- No.

05:50.549 --> 05:51.815
What have you got for us?

05:51.850 --> 05:54.291
Okay, well, first of all,
I don't love this dynamic.

05:54.326 --> 05:55.702
Where is, "Hello"?
Where is, "Are you okay"?

05:55.756 --> 05:58.227
Where's, "Hey Rich, those bruises
make you look super tough"?

05:58.262 --> 05:59.940
Also, what are your real names?

05:59.975 --> 06:01.503
My name is Kurt Weller.

06:01.538 --> 06:03.923
I'm a special agent with the FBI.

06:03.958 --> 06:05.825
This is our consultant, Jane Doe.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.357
Jane Doe? Wow.

06:07.392 --> 06:09.873
So... so punk.

06:09.908 --> 06:11.253
I dig the ink, too.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.487
Did that hurt?

06:12.522 --> 06:13.535
I heard the neck is the most sens...

06:13.574 --> 06:16.278
Where is Sho Ahktar and how do we get him?

06:16.442 --> 06:17.674
You see, that's what I love about you two.

06:17.709 --> 06:18.963
You keep me focused.

06:19.075 --> 06:20.282
Sho and I are old friends.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.893
He and I used to do a
lot of business together

06:21.985 --> 06:24.140
before you two took me out of the game.

06:24.220 --> 06:27.597
And he has a soft spot
for unattainable art.

06:28.019 --> 06:30.847
- "Unattainable"?
- Stolen.

06:31.039 --> 06:32.215
And?

06:32.595 --> 06:35.146
I just might have something
he won't be able to turn down.

06:36.611 --> 06:38.588
The Gardner paintings.

06:38.944 --> 06:41.595
- Oh, do I have your attention now?
- 1990,

06:41.630 --> 06:45.265
13 works were stolen from
the Gardner Museum in Boston.

06:45.342 --> 06:47.662
They're worth half a billion dollars.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.593
Perfect job. No arrests.

06:50.753 --> 06:51.753
No suspects.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.150
And you have them?

06:53.218 --> 06:55.657
I've already arranged
the exchange with Ahktar.

06:55.752 --> 06:58.896
He wants to meet in the next
72 hours right here in New York.

06:58.944 --> 07:00.068
Everybody knows you're in prison.

07:00.103 --> 07:01.730
It was all over the news.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.954
How does Ahktar expect you to meet him?

07:03.989 --> 07:05.161
Because I'm breaking out.

07:05.247 --> 07:06.684
Stay with me.

07:06.746 --> 07:09.047
You fake my escape, I get you Ahktar,

07:09.101 --> 07:10.667
and then I'll go right back to prison.

07:10.737 --> 07:12.066
Medium security would be fine, okay?

07:12.120 --> 07:15.661
These people are monsters in here
and have, like, zero sense of humor.

07:15.732 --> 07:17.800
Also, the sex is surprisingly vanilla.

07:17.892 --> 07:20.063
I keep telling people,
"Hello, we're in prison.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.309
"What are you afraid of? Just get in there

07:21.379 --> 07:23.296
and go for it and just
have some fun," you know?

07:23.390 --> 07:24.651
I mean, treat me like a piece of meat.

07:24.721 --> 07:27.093
- All right, enough.
- Okay, look...

07:27.128 --> 07:29.012
Long story short,

07:29.047 --> 07:31.804
I'm not gonna make it
in here, okay? I know me.

07:31.839 --> 07:34.845
These people will kill me eventually.

07:34.929 --> 07:37.266
So do you want Ahktar or not?

07:38.038 --> 07:39.864
I think we can make that happen.

07:39.972 --> 07:41.673
You know what you just did?

07:42.767 --> 07:45.066
You just got the band back together.

07:52.936 --> 07:57.936
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

07:59.490 --> 08:01.572
- Please sign here.
- How many of these do I have to do?

08:01.616 --> 08:02.836
Here.

08:03.392 --> 08:06.116
You two aren't actually
married in real life?

08:06.171 --> 08:06.988
Here.

08:07.023 --> 08:09.946
'Cause you had some serious
chemistry back at the Hamptons.

08:10.061 --> 08:11.615
It's all part of the act.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.060
You know, that does make
sense, because I was getting

08:13.146 --> 08:15.037
a lot of non-verbal sexual cues from you.

08:15.086 --> 08:17.053
So just so you know, I was picking
up what you were putting down!

08:17.137 --> 08:18.965
All right, where are these paintings?

08:19.766 --> 08:21.671
Oh, I don't have them.

08:21.795 --> 08:23.098
- What?
- Did I say I had them?

08:23.153 --> 08:24.853
Yeah, that is exactly what you said.

08:24.913 --> 08:27.308
No, I'm pretty sure I left
that part intentionally vague.

08:27.387 --> 08:29.736
The important thing is
that I know where they are.

08:29.791 --> 08:32.552
I just need your help stealing them
so we can use them to trap Ahktar.

08:32.602 --> 08:33.787
All right, this was not part of the deal.

08:33.865 --> 08:35.416
It's not <i>not</i> part of the deal.

08:35.506 --> 08:36.506
So where are they?

08:36.578 --> 08:39.287
Ooh, there's my angry little munchkin.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.308
You know what, "Stubbles,"
why don't you have a seat,

08:40.370 --> 08:42.107
I'll walk you through it.

08:44.388 --> 08:46.255
Start walking.

08:46.572 --> 08:48.209
The works we seek are contained within

08:48.244 --> 08:51.306
an unassuming brownstone
in the heart of Cobble Hill.

08:51.361 --> 08:55.169
This pleasant home belongs
to a renowned art historian,

08:55.284 --> 08:57.450
decorated former Marine, and perpetrator

08:57.504 --> 09:00.539
of the Gardner heist,
professor Randall Turner.

09:00.610 --> 09:02.284
The good professor teaches
at some of the finest

09:02.362 --> 09:04.592
art schools in the city,
when he's not busy being

09:04.639 --> 09:07.268
the finest burglar of the 20th century...

09:07.303 --> 09:11.829
exacting, precise, and sociopathically
brutal when the job calls for it.

09:11.864 --> 09:16.483
If you have unlimited funds, a flexible
moral compass, and a penchant for art

09:16.545 --> 09:19.331
that's not for sale, Turner's your man.

09:19.396 --> 09:21.323
But the Gardner job was special.

09:21.363 --> 09:23.274
That one he did for himself.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.195
And to keep his precious paintings safe,

09:25.273 --> 09:26.934
he built an entire house around them,

09:27.015 --> 09:30.249
complete with the most insane
security system I've ever encountered.

09:30.284 --> 09:32.352
Security measure number
one, the smart watch.

09:32.415 --> 09:35.076
On his wrist at all times,
it disarms and re-arms

09:35.181 --> 09:37.282
every room as he walks through it.

09:41.931 --> 09:43.982
We turn down the wrong hallway without it,

09:44.021 --> 09:45.987
it triggers the alarm.

09:46.159 --> 09:49.657
Turner keeps his prized paintings
in a windowless concrete gallery

09:49.751 --> 09:50.831
in the middle of his house,

09:50.882 --> 09:53.038
completely insulated
from the outside world.

09:53.133 --> 09:54.159
To access it,

09:54.197 --> 09:56.691
we need to get past
security measure number two,

09:56.753 --> 09:58.700
a 12-digit keypad lock,

09:58.786 --> 10:00.568
and security measure number three,

10:00.676 --> 10:03.090
a heat-sensitive palm scan.

10:03.168 --> 10:05.109
All of which brings us to
security measure number four,

10:05.190 --> 10:08.561
and believe me, I've
saved the worst for last.

10:08.961 --> 10:11.810
Each painting is tethered
to five separate wires

10:11.854 --> 10:14.555
leading into the wall behind it.

10:14.833 --> 10:17.427
Remove the painting without
disengaging the wires

10:17.481 --> 10:20.087
and a shotgun blast fires
from behind the canvas,

10:20.187 --> 10:23.151
destroying the paintings and
killing any would-be thief.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.866
I mean, overkill much?

10:24.944 --> 10:28.068
Okay, how do you know all of this?

10:28.138 --> 10:30.038
Because I've been
planning this job for ages,

10:30.123 --> 10:32.855
and I would have gotten away with it,
too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.

10:32.890 --> 10:34.109
Why do we need the paintings at all?

10:34.168 --> 10:36.649
Just tell Ahktar you have them and
then we'll take him down at the meet.

10:36.734 --> 10:37.939
Yeah, that would totally work,

10:38.028 --> 10:40.118
if Ahktar was a complete idiot.

10:40.153 --> 10:42.384
But there's a reason you don't
even have a photograph of the man.

10:42.462 --> 10:45.065
He's incredibly thorough
and incredibly paranoid.

10:45.135 --> 10:46.792
12 hours prior to the meet,

10:46.827 --> 10:48.993
he is going to request one
of the paintings at random,

10:49.063 --> 10:50.284
We won't know which one.

10:50.382 --> 10:52.820
I'll send it over and if it checks out,

10:52.855 --> 10:55.586
he'll tell us how and where the
rest of the handoff goes down.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.553
And you're sure he'll be there?

10:57.608 --> 10:58.986
Ahktar is meticulous.

10:59.057 --> 11:02.895
These are the most prestigious paintings
in the entire underground art world.

11:02.968 --> 11:05.152
He's gonna want to verify them himself.

11:05.416 --> 11:07.501
Fine, but we are FBI,

11:07.670 --> 11:09.314
so we don't need to steal them.

11:09.408 --> 11:11.497
We get a warrant and we arrest him.

11:11.591 --> 11:15.003
Can we start assuming that criminals that
have avoided capture their entire lives

11:15.092 --> 11:17.467
are just a titch smarter than you?

11:17.530 --> 11:19.353
Turner wears a kill switch around his neck.

11:19.415 --> 11:20.986
And, of course, there's
purism created by...

11:21.045 --> 11:22.696
He even smells the word Fed,

11:22.782 --> 11:25.132
he presses a switch and
the gallery incinerates,

11:25.187 --> 11:28.370
destroying all the art and any evidence
that could lead to a conviction.

11:28.450 --> 11:31.425
Look, we can't arrest Turner and
we don't have time to make fakes,

11:31.491 --> 11:33.280
so if you wish to capture Ahktar,

11:33.315 --> 11:35.913
we need to steal the Gardner paintings.

11:35.983 --> 11:38.995
<i>If</i> we do play along...

11:39.231 --> 11:40.157
what's your plan?

11:40.212 --> 11:42.177
This is the way I think it should play out.

11:42.261 --> 11:44.554
Step one, we smoke him out.

11:45.554 --> 11:47.174
This is actually kinda fun.

11:47.285 --> 11:52.222
My mom and I used to build these
RC cars and race 'em around.

11:52.347 --> 11:55.383
Kinda feels like that.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.182
Okay. In position, here goes.

11:59.209 --> 12:01.780
And... we're cooking with gas.

12:10.453 --> 12:12.659
Yes, I'd like to report a gas leak.

12:12.753 --> 12:15.900
Okay, his call's gone through.

12:18.161 --> 12:20.297
Hey, what's going on?
You the guy with the leak?

12:20.348 --> 12:22.001
I'm the one who called.

12:23.992 --> 12:25.217
You want me to fix it from here?

12:25.295 --> 12:28.041
I use induction burners.
Must be one of the neighbors.

12:28.110 --> 12:29.184
Hey, you called me.

12:29.269 --> 12:31.142
Why don't I just come
inside and take a look?

12:31.228 --> 12:32.965
I said it's not coming from in here.

12:33.059 --> 12:34.522
Do your job, figure it out.

12:34.557 --> 12:37.746
Okay, okay. It's cool, it's cool.

12:37.881 --> 12:39.959
You have yourself a wonderful day.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.764
Now, these smart watches
map and store movements

12:44.819 --> 12:46.843
of their users to an insane degree.

12:46.955 --> 12:49.648
It's all in the name of fitness
tracking, but in the wrong hands...

12:49.683 --> 12:53.150
these, for example...
they're a veritable gold mine.

12:53.261 --> 12:55.090
All we need is to find
the right line of code

12:55.137 --> 12:57.855
from the data Reade cloned
from his watch and...

12:57.914 --> 13:00.108
there we go.

13:00.470 --> 13:01.928
- Right?
- That's actually...

13:01.973 --> 13:03.611
- That's pretty smart.
- What's smart?

13:03.646 --> 13:05.916
So he's isolated Turner's
hand movements corresponding

13:05.951 --> 13:08.304
to when he typed in his 12-digit key code.

13:08.393 --> 13:10.353
It's just like looking over his shoulder,

13:10.429 --> 13:12.468
except you have to be a genius to do it.

13:12.538 --> 13:16.093
And since we know the exact
brand and make of the keypad,

13:16.128 --> 13:18.683
we can use his hand gestures
to extrapolate the code.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.934
We just beat security measures one and two.

13:20.988 --> 13:23.289
- "We."
- Well, how do we pass the hand scanner?

13:23.324 --> 13:24.097
Oh, that's simple.

13:24.132 --> 13:26.307
We just take a trip up to
my storage unit in Yonkers.

13:26.415 --> 13:28.220
It's a quick drive. I call shotgun.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.737
Just tell me what I'm looking for.

13:29.812 --> 13:30.711
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.941
Okay, it's a huge storage unit.
I don't know where the thing is.

13:33.025 --> 13:35.093
What are you gonna do, bring it all here?

13:38.598 --> 13:39.992
This is so stupid!

13:40.027 --> 13:43.810
My locker was messy, but I had a
system. This is just a disaster.

13:44.158 --> 13:46.869
What if this is his way of
sneaking something into the FBI?

13:46.904 --> 13:48.732
We X-rayed everything, demagnetized it,

13:48.767 --> 13:51.543
tested it for explosives,
chemicals... we're good.

13:51.599 --> 13:52.599
Here it is!

13:52.676 --> 13:54.311
Oh, here it is.

13:58.356 --> 13:59.769
One glove?

13:59.823 --> 14:01.903
You made me drag all this
junk up here for one glove?

14:01.960 --> 14:03.289
I didn't make you do anything.

14:03.359 --> 14:05.012
I voted field trip. You chose...

14:05.082 --> 14:07.878
- Okay, what does that thing do?
- This thing is the culmination

14:07.934 --> 14:10.250
of over a year spent
collecting partial prints

14:10.285 --> 14:13.117
from door handles, coffee mugs, chairs,

14:13.168 --> 14:16.164
so that my right hand
perfectly replicates Turner's.

14:16.258 --> 14:19.185
This thing is how we beat the palm scanner.

14:19.263 --> 14:21.324
- Great, hand it over.
- Hand it over?

14:21.405 --> 14:23.312
Dad joke!
Beep-bop-bo...

14:24.362 --> 14:25.101
Give it to me.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.787
- Now.
- Am I talking to myself?

14:26.857 --> 14:28.193
It has to be my hand.

14:28.271 --> 14:31.070
You try to get your fleshy meat paw
into this thing and it'll never work.

14:31.105 --> 14:33.072
I have to come with you.

14:34.347 --> 14:35.457
It's fun, right?

14:35.559 --> 14:38.106
We need to shut down this whole
operation, send him back to prison.

14:38.162 --> 14:40.819
I don't trust him, either, but it's not
like we're letting him do the job alone.

14:40.936 --> 14:42.336
He'll be unarmed, he'll be with us.

14:42.404 --> 14:44.005
Yeah, and he'll be unpredictable.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.381
It's too dangerous, Ally.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.144
I've been doing this job for ten years.

14:47.245 --> 14:49.119
I don't need you to evaluate risk for me.

14:49.209 --> 14:50.583
He's playing us.

14:50.618 --> 14:52.724
I don't know how yet, but trust me.

14:52.759 --> 14:53.604
You don't know this guy.

14:53.698 --> 14:55.055
How 'bout you stop telling
me things I don't know?

14:55.179 --> 14:57.259
- How about that?
- Enough!

14:57.294 --> 15:02.055
Groups like ISIS and the Dabbur Zann
have been flourishing thanks in large part

15:02.090 --> 15:05.162
to the money Ahktar has
been siphoning to them.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.458
I understand that.

15:06.551 --> 15:11.705
Taking Ahktar out of circulation
would be a massive blow

15:11.814 --> 15:14.663
to terrorist organizations
around the world.

15:14.739 --> 15:16.715
The mission's a go.

15:17.191 --> 15:19.651
Turner has a seminar at 3:00 p.m.

15:19.784 --> 15:22.823
That gives you, Dotcom, Jane, and Ally

15:22.948 --> 15:25.579
two hours to break in,
remove the art, and get out.

15:25.665 --> 15:28.826
Also referred to as Cubist Realism,
its artists were known as Immaculates,

15:28.881 --> 15:30.594
and with good reason, so...

15:30.680 --> 15:33.100
Tell me, what's going
on here? What do you see?

15:33.200 --> 15:36.135
Good here. Lecture just started.

15:36.229 --> 15:37.536
But remember...

15:37.604 --> 15:40.097
Turner has a fatal kill switch.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.618
If he returns early, Reade
and Zapata won't be able

15:42.681 --> 15:44.594
to stop him without endangering you.

15:44.695 --> 15:47.407
- So you two are dating, huh?
- Just focus on the lock.

15:47.493 --> 15:49.214
That explains why you're
both so grumpy all the time.

15:49.328 --> 15:51.105
You're a terrible match. Way too similar.

15:51.191 --> 15:53.627
It's like trying to put a
square peg in a square peg.

15:53.737 --> 15:55.771
Also, I'm pretty sure she's a lesbian.

15:55.869 --> 15:58.599
If that door's not open in five
seconds, I'm gonna break your jaw.

15:58.787 --> 15:59.722
I'm just saying, historically,

15:59.757 --> 16:01.692
I have a pretty good nose
for this sort of thing.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.462
Fine. I'll break your nose.

16:03.561 --> 16:05.953
Play your cards right, you get a
little holy trinity going, am I right?

16:05.988 --> 16:07.578
Move. Move.

16:07.613 --> 16:09.113
Give it to me.

16:12.407 --> 16:13.212
Ready?

16:13.302 --> 16:15.203
I just got really turned on.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.822
No alarm.

16:23.463 --> 16:24.713
This thing actually works.

16:24.748 --> 16:25.795
Was there ever any doubt?

16:25.860 --> 16:28.219
- There still is.
- Where is the trust?

16:49.464 --> 16:51.323
All right. Number?

16:52.183 --> 16:54.365
0-5-2-0

16:54.430 --> 16:58.366
7-8-0-1-1-3-1-2.

17:00.815 --> 17:02.089
- Huh.
- What the hell is this?

17:02.169 --> 17:03.555
That is an iris scanner.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.713
Don't panic, we got plenty of time.

17:04.748 --> 17:06.031
Let me just think. We just need to...

17:06.066 --> 17:07.873
_

17:07.954 --> 17:09.959
Start panicking.

17:14.837 --> 17:16.329
Well, what happens if that reaches zero?

17:16.392 --> 17:17.813
It gets very hot in "hurr."

17:17.848 --> 17:19.759
I'm sorry, terrible joke.
I just got quite nervous.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.056
Patterson. Any ideas?

17:21.099 --> 17:22.710
<i>It's a Biro 7-9-1
eye scanner.</i>

17:22.788 --> 17:25.472
Ugh... Why did it have to be a Biro?

17:25.573 --> 17:26.573
Hey, Patty, this is Rich.

17:26.598 --> 17:27.807
She can hear you from over there.

17:27.905 --> 17:30.074
- <i>Please don't call me Patty.</i>
- The doors are electromagnetic.

17:30.128 --> 17:31.550
If we cut the power,
the locks would disengage

17:31.620 --> 17:33.653
- while the system restarts.
- Wouldn't that alert Turner?

17:33.729 --> 17:34.804
Yeah, but it would still
take him like a half an hour

17:34.898 --> 17:36.794
- to get back here.
- So...

17:36.892 --> 17:38.000
we have to be fast.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.988
Yeah, or dead if he trips his kill switch.

17:40.066 --> 17:42.757
If I'm Turner, I'm not gonna destroy
my priceless beloved stolen paintings

17:42.832 --> 17:43.858
over a false alarm.

17:43.965 --> 17:45.297
I don't think. Who feels lucky?

17:45.347 --> 17:46.525
Can you disengage all 11 paintings

17:46.572 --> 17:48.515
- in half an hour?
- Maybe.

17:48.585 --> 17:49.842
30 seconds.

17:49.937 --> 17:50.994
This is exciting.

17:51.029 --> 17:54.080
Patterson... can you cut
this power in 30 seconds?

17:54.177 --> 17:55.911
- <i>On it.</i>
- If you hack into the local grid,

17:55.972 --> 17:58.734
there should be... She's got it covered.

17:59.497 --> 18:00.924
We need to find something
to brace the doors open

18:01.037 --> 18:02.276
or else they're just gonna slam shut

18:02.345 --> 18:04.013
when the power comes back on.

18:04.048 --> 18:05.728
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

18:08.818 --> 18:10.378
That is the bronze eagle finial.

18:10.462 --> 18:13.212
You just made a $100,000 doorstop.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.457
You're welcome.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.146
You may recognize his 1910,

18:17.210 --> 18:18.571
<i>Nu Dan la Forêt.</i>

18:18.667 --> 18:21.302
Now, note this...

18:21.556 --> 18:22.684
_

18:27.941 --> 18:28.995
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

18:29.084 --> 18:30.755
I'm gonna have to cut class short today.

18:30.833 --> 18:31.967
Apologies.

18:32.976 --> 18:35.088
He's on the move. You sure you
don't want us to take him down now?

18:35.123 --> 18:37.035
No! Our guys are in the gallery right now.

18:37.090 --> 18:40.214
If he spots you and hits that kill
switch, they are literal toast.

18:40.249 --> 18:44.215
Now, this is a two-person
job, the brains and the muscle.

18:44.309 --> 18:47.119
Weller, you're the muscle. So, can you...

18:48.710 --> 18:50.947
Okay, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...

18:51.663 --> 18:55.082
Okay, now, the muscle carefully
lifts the painting off its hook

18:55.164 --> 18:56.670
and moves it forward about an inch.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.337
Now, this will allow the brains

18:59.468 --> 19:02.368
to sever the tension wires from its back...

19:03.839 --> 19:06.553
thus freeing it from the
explosive shotgun charge.

19:06.588 --> 19:09.252
So, you know... steady hands.

19:09.369 --> 19:11.579
Once the muscle has the weight,

19:11.684 --> 19:15.891
he can't move until all five
tension wires have been cut.

19:15.966 --> 19:20.178
Otherwise, you get a bunch
of new holes in your face.

19:21.417 --> 19:23.124
Now lift, lift.

19:23.159 --> 19:25.739
Step back slowly... Slowly.

19:30.621 --> 19:32.276
That's one down, ten to go.

19:32.311 --> 19:33.311
Boys versus girls?

19:47.197 --> 19:49.949
Um... guys, I have some bad news.

19:49.996 --> 19:51.855
- <i>Turner is...</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:51.918 --> 19:53.339
New holes in the face, remember?

19:53.374 --> 19:54.755
Guys? Hello?

19:54.847 --> 19:55.953
- Patterson?
- The comms are dead.

19:56.055 --> 19:57.456
They can't make it through the lead door.

19:57.503 --> 19:59.445
- Turner must be close.
- Panel by the door.

19:59.534 --> 20:00.496
Think you can do something about that?

20:00.582 --> 20:02.196
- Yeah.
- On it.

20:02.606 --> 20:04.198
So tell me again why you're not with Jane?

20:04.286 --> 20:05.599
'Cause I mean every time
something goes wrong,

20:05.634 --> 20:09.337
or goes right for that matter, you
look at Jane first... not Ally, Jane.

20:09.821 --> 20:10.901
Doesn't mean a thing.

20:10.979 --> 20:14.075
Some people might think that it means
you're more worried/excited about Jane

20:14.163 --> 20:16.899
than you are about lady
Tommy Lee Jones over there.

20:16.970 --> 20:20.074
Why don't you focus on cutting the wires

20:20.148 --> 20:22.342
and disarm the shotgun aimed at my face

20:22.412 --> 20:23.884
and stop talking about Jane.

20:23.993 --> 20:25.908
I can do both. I'm an
excellent multitasker.

20:25.994 --> 20:27.756
I think I got something.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.508
Uhh! Damn!

20:30.364 --> 20:32.226
<i>Repeat, Turner is in the house!</i>

20:32.261 --> 20:33.862
<i>You need to get out! Do you read?</i>

20:42.249 --> 20:43.946
Easy, easy, easy.

20:50.141 --> 20:51.145
Hold it.

20:51.207 --> 20:52.019
Cut the wires!

20:52.099 --> 20:53.115
Two to go!

21:01.961 --> 21:03.921
Jane. Jane!

21:04.027 --> 21:05.292
Jane...

21:12.607 --> 21:14.468
Al. Ally!

21:14.549 --> 21:15.250
- Yeah.
- You okay?

21:15.319 --> 21:17.175
Yeah. I mean...

21:17.216 --> 21:20.007
I mean, I'm seeing two
of you, but I'm okay.

21:20.099 --> 21:22.973
Three's company, we got a problem.

21:24.339 --> 21:26.372
You think Ahktar's gonna notice that?

21:33.604 --> 21:36.789
How long until Ahktar tells us
which painting he wants to inspect?

21:36.879 --> 21:39.227
- 13 hours.
- Well, we could cross

21:39.262 --> 21:41.280
our fingers and hope he
doesn't choose this one.

21:41.366 --> 21:42.595
We can't take that risk.

21:42.658 --> 21:44.170
There's no way that you can fix this?

21:44.248 --> 21:46.351
There's maybe five
people in the whole world

21:46.434 --> 21:49.701
who can restore this type of damage,
and none in the time frame that we need.

21:55.002 --> 21:56.520
You know someone.

21:56.555 --> 21:57.277
Come again?

21:57.332 --> 21:59.860
When we put you away, you
were one of the biggest

21:59.895 --> 22:02.533
black market players in the world.

22:02.715 --> 22:05.290
You know someone who can fix this.

22:05.344 --> 22:06.601
I do?

22:06.679 --> 22:10.738
We don't nail Ahktar, you go
straight back to maximum security.

22:10.837 --> 22:14.198
So if there's someone you
can call, I suggest you do it.

22:17.255 --> 22:18.763
It's not that easy.

22:18.851 --> 22:20.718
I mean, even if I did know
somebody, then this person

22:20.808 --> 22:23.121
could hypothetically be a fugitive.

22:23.193 --> 22:25.403
So, I would need some sort of guarantee

22:25.496 --> 22:27.358
that this person, who may or may not exist,

22:27.405 --> 22:30.053
would not get arrested if
they were to help us out.

22:30.119 --> 22:32.329
I'm not giving out blind blanket immunity.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.550
I'm not saying immunity, just amnesty.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.874
You know, just a freebie, one-time thing.

22:36.970 --> 22:38.618
And some money, obviously.

22:38.703 --> 22:40.842
I could probably sell
that to this hypothetical,

22:40.921 --> 22:43.604
fictional person that may or may not exist.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.833
Fine.

22:48.969 --> 22:51.183
All right. Put 'er... there.

22:51.218 --> 22:52.343
I just thought we'd maybe...

22:52.498 --> 22:53.398
I'll just take your word for it.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.769
Can I borrow your phone, please?

22:57.234 --> 23:00.291
I present to you Boston Arliss Crab,

23:00.441 --> 23:02.873
the world's premiere art restorer.

23:02.951 --> 23:06.041
If he's the world's premiere art
restorer, what's he wanted for?

23:06.124 --> 23:10.214
He may have forged a
painting or two... hundred.

23:12.567 --> 23:14.368
Hold this a second?

23:15.478 --> 23:16.612
Oh!

23:17.982 --> 23:19.966
You do not get to call me out
of the blue after five years

23:20.001 --> 23:22.314
of nothing and pretend like we're okay.

23:22.427 --> 23:24.238
We are not okay.

23:24.293 --> 23:27.721
You left me in Nice holding the bill for
that horrifically vandalized hotel suite,

23:27.824 --> 23:28.947
and then I find out three weeks later,

23:28.982 --> 23:31.738
you're gallivanting
around Rome with a woman?

23:31.871 --> 23:34.908
- A woman?
- A very beautiful, very famous woman.

23:34.982 --> 23:37.255
That's got to take some
of the sting out of it.

23:38.365 --> 23:39.184
Or not.

23:39.219 --> 23:40.991
I hate to interrupt your
little reunion here, but...

23:41.062 --> 23:42.288
Oh, I'm not here for him.

23:42.376 --> 23:44.477
I'm here for the Gardner paintings.

23:48.188 --> 23:50.970
Well, I've seen worse.

23:51.206 --> 23:53.073
I'll need a week.

23:53.162 --> 23:54.862
You've got ten hours.

23:54.952 --> 23:56.975
That is much less time!

23:57.202 --> 23:58.793
Uh, all right, um...

23:58.828 --> 24:00.279
I'll need to scan all the paintings first.

24:00.350 --> 24:03.211
Wait, why? This is the only
one that's been damaged.

24:03.246 --> 24:05.079
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Special agent...

24:05.161 --> 24:07.785
Great. So, we've established
that you know nothing about art.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.289
I...

24:09.392 --> 24:12.030
The buyer is going to want to
inspect all of the paintings,

24:12.108 --> 24:14.021
so if I'm going to restore this one,

24:14.105 --> 24:15.853
I need to match it to the others.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.680
Light damage, dust
accumulation, pigment fail.

24:18.751 --> 24:20.595
They need to be uniform,

24:20.641 --> 24:24.713
so why don't you show me just how
special you are, special agent whatever,

24:24.776 --> 24:28.380
by getting me my scanner and rounding
up all the other paintings so I can get

24:28.447 --> 24:29.932
started doing the thing that none of you

24:29.969 --> 24:32.576
know how to do with not
enough time to do it?

24:32.611 --> 24:34.065
How about that?

24:34.100 --> 24:35.059
- Are you kidding...
- No, no...

24:35.125 --> 24:36.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

24:37.161 --> 24:38.564
Settle down, all right?

24:38.633 --> 24:41.228
Let's get him set up.
The sooner he finishes,

24:41.313 --> 24:43.814
- the sooner we can get him out of here.
- Okay.

24:47.814 --> 24:49.439
Can you help me with this?

24:56.784 --> 24:58.075
Squancher?

24:58.110 --> 25:01.522
Yeah, it's a niche dating site
with surprisingly good encryption.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.668
I use it to talk to Ahktar under the radar.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.086
Also use it for other things.

25:05.124 --> 25:07.322
I'm, uh, Kim Burly.

25:07.624 --> 25:09.744
So I take it you don't date very often?

25:10.265 --> 25:11.784
There's no Mr. Doe in your life?

25:11.819 --> 25:14.356
No tattooed knave with a heart of gold?

25:14.391 --> 25:16.847
You know, this new prison is going to allow
conjugal visits. I just want to float that

25:16.933 --> 25:18.493
out there on this new idea cloud and...

25:18.525 --> 25:20.596
Oh, here we go.

25:20.631 --> 25:22.694
"Tall Tim." This is Ahktar.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.684
<i>I want to meet a fat Frenchman.</i>

25:24.723 --> 25:25.641
<i>See how heavy he really is.</i>

25:25.676 --> 25:27.167
- What?
- Okay, we're in luck.

25:27.202 --> 25:30.484
He wants to see one of the
Degas, <i>La Sortie de Pesage.</i>

25:30.587 --> 25:32.739
That should buy us enough time
to mend the Vermeer, right?

25:32.774 --> 25:34.961
Well, unless Crab screws it up.

25:35.078 --> 25:37.579
I've got just the guy.

25:37.632 --> 25:40.263
When can I introduce you?

25:42.150 --> 25:44.278
He's giving me the
instructions now, he's...

25:45.174 --> 25:47.028
My guys will deliver and
tail Ahktar's courier.

25:47.063 --> 25:48.831
What?

25:48.929 --> 25:51.617
I mean, you could try,
but you're gonna lose him.

25:51.703 --> 25:52.357
We'll see.

25:52.392 --> 25:54.501
Yeah, see him slip your
tail? Absolutely, we will.

25:54.536 --> 25:56.695
Just... write it down.

25:57.168 --> 25:58.168
Done.

26:00.521 --> 26:01.654
Hey, here.

26:01.759 --> 26:03.760
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

26:10.496 --> 26:12.402
I really like Ally.

26:12.504 --> 26:15.309
I mean, she seems... smart.

26:15.410 --> 26:18.307
And... beautiful and tough.

26:18.349 --> 26:20.417
I can totally see the appeal.

26:23.361 --> 26:25.566
- Uh, I really...
- You...

26:25.648 --> 26:27.755
You don't really want to
talk about this with me.

26:27.830 --> 26:29.287
No, it's...

26:30.945 --> 26:32.827
Hey, Ally.

26:33.253 --> 26:34.332
Did you track Ahktar's people?

26:34.395 --> 26:35.780
Uh, he slipped our tail.

26:35.858 --> 26:36.911
He contacted Rich, though.

26:36.950 --> 26:39.414
I guess the painting checked
out, 'cause he just set the meet.

26:39.454 --> 26:41.409
- How we doing over here?
- Well, he's still alive,

26:41.444 --> 26:43.309
so I'd say we're doing pretty good.

26:43.344 --> 26:44.947
I meant the painting. Is it okay?

26:45.037 --> 26:46.262
No.

26:47.330 --> 26:49.140
It's fantastic.

26:50.241 --> 26:53.770
Ahktar has allegedly set
up shop in the penthouse

26:53.829 --> 26:56.018
of the Binder Hotel, where he's hosting

26:56.097 --> 26:59.152
a very exclusive Gatsby-themed party.

26:59.187 --> 27:01.161
And he's expecting Rich and
the paintings there in an hour?

27:01.196 --> 27:02.265
You know, it's actually
a good thing you brought

27:02.310 --> 27:05.743
all my stuff from storage, 'cause I
think I have a tux in there, so thank you.

27:05.778 --> 27:09.355
All right, we're gonna
fit him with that bracelet.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.195
It's gonna transmit his
audio and his location.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.331
We'll be in position outside
in a surveillance van.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.306
And since we have no idea
what Ahktar looks like

27:16.352 --> 27:18.853
and only a couple phone
recordings to voice match,

27:18.958 --> 27:21.510
it's on Mr. Dotcom's
shoulders to confirm our tango.

27:21.545 --> 27:25.630
The second he has positive
ID, Rich will use the phrase...

27:26.745 --> 27:28.601
"Mustard on the beat, ho."

27:28.705 --> 27:30.945
♪ Mustard on that beat, ho! ♪

27:31.390 --> 27:32.787
Supposed to be in my voice.

27:32.856 --> 27:34.840
Hear the phrase, take the room, got it.

27:34.925 --> 27:36.411
Not a second before.

27:36.482 --> 27:38.928
- All right, let's get changed.
- Um, I'm sorry, "let's"?

27:38.981 --> 27:41.669
As in, le... let us? As in you and me?

27:41.740 --> 27:42.993
You think we're gonna
let you go in there alone?

27:43.063 --> 27:46.548
- I'm your date.
- You?

27:46.614 --> 27:48.420
You're the coppest cop that ever copped.

27:48.489 --> 27:51.249
I walk in with you, I'll be dead
before the doors open all the way.

27:51.325 --> 27:53.451
Fine. I'll go with you.

27:53.540 --> 27:56.157
As what, my cousin Stu from the FBI?

27:56.192 --> 27:57.721
No, you know what? I'm out.
Okay, that prison sucks,

27:57.756 --> 27:59.673
but at least I'm not dead!

27:59.708 --> 28:01.108
I'll go.

28:01.314 --> 28:03.014
I look the part, right?

28:03.174 --> 28:05.628
- And I can handle him.
- She certainly can.

28:05.694 --> 28:08.340
And I mean, she definitely
doesn't read as civil servant.

28:08.418 --> 28:09.637
I can do this.

28:09.703 --> 28:11.738
We can't let this fall apart now.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.195
Jane goes.

28:14.421 --> 28:16.163
Let's suit up.

28:18.652 --> 28:20.586
- Jane...
- Look, I'll be fine.

28:20.628 --> 28:22.537
This Ahktar guy is no joke, all right?

28:22.597 --> 28:23.756
We'll be just outside.

28:23.813 --> 28:26.920
If you think it's going sideways,
say the word, I'll be there.

28:26.963 --> 28:28.663
Are we doing this or what?

28:42.369 --> 28:45.097
Why'd you cover up the
tattoos? I love the tattoos.

28:45.180 --> 28:46.863
They draw unnecessary attention.

28:46.972 --> 28:50.233
That's smart. That's good
thinking. Keep a low profile.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.540
Hey, what did "Stubbles"
whisper to you back at HQ?

28:55.638 --> 28:57.364
Looked really intense.

28:59.244 --> 29:00.958
<i>He just told me to be careful.</i>

29:00.993 --> 29:02.004
<i>Hmm. Yeah.</i>

29:02.039 --> 29:05.222
<i>He really seems to
worry about you a lot.</i>

29:05.312 --> 29:06.434
<i>We are part of a team,</i>

29:06.469 --> 29:08.231
and teams look after each other.

29:08.266 --> 29:09.532
Right.

29:09.737 --> 29:14.365
I mean, it's for sure more than
that, but, hey, "E" for effort.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.572
I thought you said this was a Gatsby party?

29:24.678 --> 29:26.904
Why is no one else dressed up?

29:26.986 --> 29:28.976
I may have misread the code.

29:42.722 --> 29:43.904
- Gunshots.
- Weller, stand down.

29:44.014 --> 29:47.985
He's not shooting at us, he's... dancing.

29:49.687 --> 29:52.142
- Wait, is that...
- Oh, boy.

29:52.238 --> 29:54.642
Looks like someone's
been on a bit of a bender.

29:54.735 --> 29:57.403
He gets a little paranoid
when he's been doing blow.

29:59.543 --> 30:00.543
Oh!

30:03.249 --> 30:06.312
This might be a little more
dangerous than I thought.

30:23.421 --> 30:24.949
Ahh.

30:25.581 --> 30:27.155
Rich Dotcom!

30:31.239 --> 30:32.453
Doing a little dancing there?

30:32.488 --> 30:34.621
- Love to dance.
- I can see that.

30:34.656 --> 30:36.525
This city has an energy.

30:36.583 --> 30:37.716
When I'm here, I must dance.

30:37.813 --> 30:39.368
I must!

30:41.054 --> 30:42.917
- Who is your friend?
- Don't worry about her.

30:42.995 --> 30:45.369
- I wasn't asking you.
- Well, you kind of were.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.575
We aren't friends.

30:47.743 --> 30:49.922
We're just sleeping together.

30:53.175 --> 30:55.213
Rich Dotcom.

30:56.922 --> 30:57.965
Are those what I think they are?

30:58.054 --> 30:59.694
God, I hope so.

31:00.290 --> 31:01.928
The Gardner paintings.

31:02.045 --> 31:03.551
Feels like a dream, doesn't it?

31:03.609 --> 31:05.525
If it was a dream, I'd be naked.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.784
Dotcom!

31:08.940 --> 31:10.647
Let's see what we got, shall we?

31:18.542 --> 31:20.475
No, no, thank you.

31:20.597 --> 31:22.204
Well, I'm here...

31:27.308 --> 31:29.377
Oh, hello, old friend.

31:29.415 --> 31:30.540
Is it him?

31:30.775 --> 31:32.870
If it's him, say the phrase.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.866
I know how this works.

31:34.991 --> 31:37.497
Something I find hard to fathom...

31:37.551 --> 31:40.966
Rembrandt and Vermeer, two
masters of the Dutch golden age

31:41.001 --> 31:43.417
living less than 50 miles
away from each other,

31:43.483 --> 31:46.353
and yet they never met.

31:47.028 --> 31:50.450
The world must have
seemed so impossibly big.

31:51.245 --> 31:52.678
Yet here we are,

31:52.783 --> 31:55.916
two masters from opposite
sides of the globe

31:55.970 --> 31:57.701
standing face to face.

31:57.736 --> 32:00.900
The world is much smaller now.

32:01.001 --> 32:02.788
Perhaps too small for the both of us.

32:02.876 --> 32:05.570
What are you doing? Take
the gun out of his mouth!

32:05.649 --> 32:07.118
These paintings are fakes.

32:07.153 --> 32:08.126
- We gotta take the room.
- No, no, no, no.

32:08.180 --> 32:09.762
He hasn't said the phrase yet.

32:09.859 --> 32:11.114
He hasn't confirmed that it's Ahktar.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.950
Well, it's a bit hard with
a gun in his mouth, isn't it?

32:12.985 --> 32:14.762
You guys might want to come and see this.

32:14.826 --> 32:17.019
Four real serious gentlemen
headed up to the penthouse

32:17.123 --> 32:18.823
- in the north elevator.
- We're pulling them out.

32:18.858 --> 32:19.565
Let's go.

32:19.665 --> 32:22.859
We stole these from Randall Turner,
the perpetrator of the Gardner heist.

32:22.930 --> 32:24.198
- Mm.
- These are real.

32:24.267 --> 32:26.442
- Mm.
- Please, look again.

32:26.477 --> 32:28.245
- You think I'm stupid?
- Mm-mm.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.899
I don't need to look twice
at second-rate forgeries.

32:32.097 --> 32:34.977
Get down! ISI! Down!

32:35.040 --> 32:36.338
You're working for ISI?

32:36.373 --> 32:37.541
Get down! Get down!

32:37.576 --> 32:38.897
- Who?
- Mm! Mm!

32:38.932 --> 32:40.951
Put your weapons down! Put 'em down!

32:40.986 --> 32:43.619
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

32:44.375 --> 32:45.734
Drop your weapon!

32:49.327 --> 32:51.247
Mustard on the beat, ho!
Mustard on the beat, ho!

32:51.286 --> 32:53.721
Code phrase, code phrase! Aah!

32:54.322 --> 32:55.322
Gah!

32:58.466 --> 33:00.346
You know, these stairs go down, too.

33:00.427 --> 33:02.461
Why are we bothering to chase this guy?

33:03.825 --> 33:05.425
Throw it away.

33:06.843 --> 33:07.977
Go on!

33:09.693 --> 33:10.899
Let's go.

33:11.023 --> 33:13.924
On your knees, both of you.

33:14.061 --> 33:16.321
Maybe we should get out of here.
You might have a... a rat back there.

33:16.356 --> 33:18.355
Oh... Oh!

33:20.003 --> 33:22.209
Oh, man, that hurts!

33:22.483 --> 33:23.547
You're the rat.

33:23.582 --> 33:25.525
And after tonight, everyone will know.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.395
You're finished!

33:26.459 --> 33:28.079
Okay, at least spare the lady, okay?

33:28.194 --> 33:30.879
She's just an innocent hooker I
picked up on the way over here.

33:30.930 --> 33:33.664
I have very few friends in this world.

33:33.773 --> 33:38.028
It fills me with great sadness
that I'll now have one less.

33:43.881 --> 33:46.689
Looks like you left it all
on the dance floor, hey, bro?

34:00.383 --> 34:01.983
Aah!

34:02.438 --> 34:04.849
Wait. If these guys are ISI...

34:05.069 --> 34:06.703
Pakistani Intelligence.

34:19.969 --> 34:20.969
_

34:21.516 --> 34:22.771
_

34:23.219 --> 34:25.304
_

34:25.338 --> 34:27.208
_

34:42.511 --> 34:44.344
- Rich!
- Stay back!

34:44.422 --> 34:45.583
Rich, what are you doing?

34:45.670 --> 34:47.112
Get down from there!

34:47.168 --> 34:48.065
Stay back!

34:48.130 --> 34:49.936
Put your guns down!

34:51.502 --> 34:54.204
Hold your fire! We're ISI!

34:58.277 --> 34:59.841
Who tipped them off?

35:00.749 --> 35:01.862
Rich.

35:01.897 --> 35:03.402
You two, secure this room.

35:03.437 --> 35:05.239
You're with me.

35:05.350 --> 35:06.972
Don't take another step, Jane!

35:07.007 --> 35:08.640
Rich, get down from there!

35:08.761 --> 35:09.979
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

35:10.067 --> 35:11.324
It's too late.

35:11.450 --> 35:13.651
Ahktar was right, I'm a dead man.

35:14.004 --> 35:15.780
I can't go back to prison.

35:15.815 --> 35:17.750
Snitches get stitches.
You heard that, right?

35:17.859 --> 35:19.279
No?

35:19.340 --> 35:21.074
I'm a bird...

35:21.272 --> 35:23.622
and birds are meant to fly.

35:23.805 --> 35:26.091
How much coke have you had?

35:26.710 --> 35:28.360
Rich! Get back in here!

35:28.416 --> 35:29.795
Get off the ledge, Rich!

35:29.900 --> 35:31.543
Don't move! Don't take another step!

35:31.629 --> 35:33.932
You nearly had us killed down there!

35:34.124 --> 35:36.835
Jane, listen to me.

35:37.101 --> 35:38.695
Life is short, you follow your heart.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.682
You tell Weller how you feel!

35:40.752 --> 35:42.322
- That's it.
- Rich!

35:42.438 --> 35:43.963
- No!
- Rich!

35:50.306 --> 35:51.697
What the hell just happened?

35:51.802 --> 35:53.319
We just got played.

36:03.309 --> 36:05.110
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

36:06.603 --> 36:08.640
Oh, my God, that was exhilarating!

36:08.733 --> 36:10.940
- You got 'em?
- Oh, no, the paintings!

36:10.975 --> 36:12.404
Yes, I have them.

36:12.497 --> 36:13.405
Oh, God, you're bleeding.

36:13.487 --> 36:15.288
And you're beautiful.

36:18.095 --> 36:19.511
Now let's get the hell out of here.

36:22.565 --> 36:24.915
- Let's get a little music going.
- Ah, I'm the DJ.

36:27.493 --> 36:28.748
A parachute?

36:28.867 --> 36:30.407
We think it was built into his tux.

36:30.442 --> 36:32.320
We searched his belongings for...

36:32.367 --> 36:33.980
explosives and computer equipment.

36:34.015 --> 36:35.785
We weren't looking for hidden parachutes.

36:35.864 --> 36:38.084
Rich was the one decoding
Ahktar's Squancher messages,

36:38.161 --> 36:39.641
so he lied about the Gatsby party

36:39.732 --> 36:41.707
so he could wear it.
Yeah, but how'd he know

36:41.765 --> 36:43.796
we'd bring his entire
storage locker to him?

36:43.831 --> 36:46.544
He didn't. He gambled. And as we all know,

36:46.638 --> 36:48.004
he's pretty comfortable taking risks.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.616
What about the paintings?

36:49.693 --> 36:52.828
The Degas was real. Why
were the others fakes?

36:52.863 --> 36:54.871
They weren't, until Crab scanned them,

36:54.942 --> 36:57.781
which I was very strongly
against, if you'll recall,

36:57.894 --> 37:01.566
and he was very particular
about what order we did them in.

37:04.266 --> 37:06.492
He must have been switching them out.

37:06.611 --> 37:09.656
- Bringing Crab in was my idea.
- Was it?

37:09.744 --> 37:12.903
There's maybe five people in
the world who can restore them.

37:14.180 --> 37:16.318
I bet he even planned the beating
that started this whole thing.

37:16.353 --> 37:18.059
- Thank you so much for this.
- Thank you.

37:18.126 --> 37:19.723
I'd beat your ass for free.

37:21.805 --> 37:24.045
This whole thing was an
elaborate prison break.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.699
And a second Gardner heist.

37:25.776 --> 37:28.873
- Well, at least we got Sho Ahktar.
- But did we?

37:28.908 --> 37:30.268
We got no photos of him.

37:30.309 --> 37:31.782
A poor voice recording.

37:31.957 --> 37:36.432
And the only guy that claims that
he can identify Ahktar is Rich.

37:36.504 --> 37:37.904
What's Ahktar saying?

37:37.979 --> 37:39.441
That he's not Ahktar.

37:39.513 --> 37:41.325
We got played.

37:41.392 --> 37:42.546
Just like I said that we would.

37:42.619 --> 37:45.978
This guy's the dumbest genius or
the smartest idiot I've ever met.

37:46.114 --> 37:48.882
All right, let's call it a night.

37:51.820 --> 37:53.093
All right.

37:53.151 --> 37:56.323
So we gonna wash this day
away with some nice scotch?

37:56.422 --> 37:58.022
I think I'm gonna pass.

37:58.110 --> 38:00.478
Why? Hang on.

38:01.251 --> 38:03.112
Because of what Rich said on the roof?

38:03.205 --> 38:05.142
He was just trying to
throw us all off-balance.

38:05.197 --> 38:06.573
It's not about what he said, all right?

38:06.616 --> 38:08.971
- It's about what I saw.
- And what'd you see?

38:09.037 --> 38:11.649
There's something between
you and Jane, okay?

38:12.724 --> 38:13.812
I don't know what it is.

38:13.860 --> 38:16.580
I don't know if you know what it is, but...

38:16.758 --> 38:19.563
don't make me feel crazy by
pretending it's not there.

38:21.057 --> 38:23.124
I think I need some space.

38:33.832 --> 38:35.583
Come on in.

38:35.767 --> 38:37.304
How'd you make out?

38:37.522 --> 38:40.506
I'm afraid there's just
not much photo to enhance.

38:40.542 --> 38:42.901
Okay. Well, thanks for trying.

38:42.936 --> 38:45.298
Hey, I've got a colleague in Denmark.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.714
He's working on some new optic software.

38:47.795 --> 38:49.213
Could I send it to him?

38:49.260 --> 38:50.972
Can he be discreet?

38:51.038 --> 38:52.487
He can.

38:54.340 --> 38:55.668
This still mean I get my dinner?

38:55.703 --> 38:58.786
- Of course.
- You should...

38:59.409 --> 39:01.149
You should bring someone.

39:02.747 --> 39:03.753
Sofia would want you...

39:03.788 --> 39:05.782
Good night, Marcus.

39:18.553 --> 39:19.665
Hey.

39:19.759 --> 39:21.481
Dad.

39:21.612 --> 39:23.224
What are you doing here so late?

39:23.284 --> 39:26.256
Someone wanted to come
in and say hello to you.

39:29.852 --> 39:30.895
Hi.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.956
Taylor?

39:41.083 --> 39:43.096
It's you, isn't it?

39:43.605 --> 39:45.428
It's nice to meet you.

39:48.174 --> 39:49.820
Don't you remember me?

39:58.404 --> 40:00.059
Of course I do.

40:05.326 --> 40:07.494
Dad... Dad!

40:07.529 --> 40:09.274
It's all right. It's all right.

40:09.309 --> 40:11.347
I... It's all right.
I'm all right, all right.

40:11.382 --> 40:13.918
- In a bit of pain?
- Yeah.

40:16.788 --> 40:17.641
Just rest.

40:17.705 --> 40:19.081
Okay.

40:20.996 --> 40:22.797
Just rest.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.312
Did you remember him?

40:26.417 --> 40:28.164
Were you just saying that?

40:31.811 --> 40:33.779
Did we, uh...

40:35.225 --> 40:37.710
Did we used to go fishing...

40:37.842 --> 40:40.836
on a bridge over a stream?

40:40.922 --> 40:44.104
Yeah... we did.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.331
Anderson Creek.

40:48.171 --> 40:49.618
You remember that?

40:52.175 --> 40:55.142
When I saw his face, I...

40:56.991 --> 40:58.825
Thank you, Jane.

41:00.770 --> 41:02.982
Thank you for coming to see him.

41:03.071 --> 41:04.742
It means a lot.

41:37.254 --> 41:39.490
That's crazy, I was
just thinking about you.

41:39.547 --> 41:40.420
You were?

41:40.502 --> 41:43.212
<i>Well, I'm actually coming
into New York next week,</i>

41:43.247 --> 41:44.640
so I was hoping...

41:44.675 --> 41:47.521
I... I guess I was hoping, too.

41:47.662 --> 41:49.491
Why don't you call me
when you get into town

41:49.593 --> 41:52.162
and maybe we can grab a drink and talk?

41:52.197 --> 41:54.403
You know we're talking now, right?

41:54.567 --> 41:56.247
You don't know me very well yet,

41:56.309 --> 41:59.789
but this is a big enough
step for me tonight.

41:59.891 --> 42:02.008
- <i>Believe me.</i>
- Okay.

42:03.077 --> 42:05.527
Well, uh, I'll see you soon.

42:05.597 --> 42:06.934
Bye.

42:11.686 --> 42:13.520
Bethany, don't shoot.

42:13.780 --> 42:15.244
It's me.

42:17.395 --> 42:19.498
Put the gun down, Bethany.
