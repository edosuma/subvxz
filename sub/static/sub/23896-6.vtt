WEBVTT

00:08.633 --> 00:13.179
Sir, the contract allows for, and I quote,
"Minor artistically valid changes."

00:13.263 --> 00:15.223
That's all this is. Diaphragm. Diaphragm.

00:16.641 --> 00:17.892
Good girl.

00:17.976 --> 00:21.604
I didn't even make changes.
I made a change, one minor change.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.567
Everyone in the show
who had the AIDS virus

00:25.650 --> 00:28.069
now has the zombie virus. That's it.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.030
And I would like to think
an intelligent man

00:30.113 --> 00:31.656
would appreciate the metaphor.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.703
Look, Bub.
You're in New York. I'm in Seattle.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.163
There's a militarized border wall

00:38.246 --> 00:41.332
and 10,000 zombies
between you and my stage.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.293
-Good luck stopping me.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.796
<i>♪ Look at that girl</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:50.425

00:53.178 --> 00:54.345
Uh, Nellie.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.058
-Work called. I gotta go.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.435
What? No.
We go on in two minutes.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.438
I told you, Nellie,
matinees are gonna be tough with my job.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.899
You deliver pizzas.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.692
I'm sorry, Nellie. But... I've got actual rent to worry about.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.954
We begin on Christmas Eve.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.040
We live in New Seattle.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.918
And since 10,000 humans
turned into zombies,

01:25.001 --> 01:27.045
nothing's been the same.

Bravo!

02:30.817 --> 02:31.901
Whoo!

02:34.737 --> 02:36.197
Well done, honey!

02:49.335 --> 02:50.879
I'm sorry for your loss.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.674
Let me walk you through
our survivor benefits.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.677
-We provide each family--

02:58.636 --> 02:59.596
Uh...

02:59.679 --> 03:00.805
A dog?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.017
I thought Denny was a person.
Your husband.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.518
Ex-husband.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.521
Before he died in the bus crash,
we had a fight at the house.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.566
And when Denny stomped off,
he took Ajax with him.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.905
This was just two days
before the crash

03:17.572 --> 03:19.949
so I thought maybe...

03:21.075 --> 03:23.036
There was no dog at the scene.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.080
Well... My son's five.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.167
He just lost his dad.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.670
Now I get to tell him
he lost his dog, too?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.886
<i>Dude, can you shut that off?</i>

03:39.969 --> 03:41.304
<i>It's for the documentary.</i> <i>I know what it's for.</i>

03:42.805 --> 03:44.349
Mama wanted us to show the world

03:44.432 --> 03:47.227
-how humans and zombies can work together.
-...work together.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.896
Yeah, I know. I was there.
I know her reasons.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.232
And if Fillmore Graves finds that footage,

03:52.315 --> 03:56.986
then humans and zombies
will work together to execute all of us.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.196
You shouldn't have brought her here.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.822
I just want to help.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.616
-She's a cop, you know.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.369
-You've got to be kidding me.
-I'm a medical examiner.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.453
For the police.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.789
We met. At the laundromat.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.500
She was trying to get a sick kid
out of Seattle for a surgery.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.002
See? She's on our side.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.546
Two weeks later,
Mama gets captured by Fillmore Graves.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.465
-I'm out of here, man.
-Don't you think if I wanted

04:17.548 --> 04:20.301
you all captured,
I would've called for backup by now?

04:20.760 --> 04:21.928
You'd all be handcuffed.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.554
What are you even suggesting?

04:23.638 --> 04:24.931
What can you do for us?

04:25.014 --> 04:26.516
I can take Mama's place.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.226
I'm willing to do the scratching.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.019
"Take Mama's place."

04:30.353 --> 04:33.022
I'm willing to stand in
for a zombie whose head got flattened.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.482
And you're acting like that's nothing.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.942
Scratching's the easy part.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.443
Levon could scratch people.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.779
Do you know how to make
fake zombie ID cards

04:40.697 --> 04:41.990
for the brain rations?

04:42.073 --> 04:43.449
New zombies gotta eat.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.285
You know, Mama had a guy,

04:45.368 --> 04:47.287
but since that guy
watched her skull get crushed,

04:47.370 --> 04:48.705
he's not answering his cell.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.206
But maybe you got a guy.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.417
Mama didn't just scratch.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.377
She knew people.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.004
Smugglers.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.339
Money people. Border patrol agents.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.550
It was a network.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.553
And after what Chase Graves did to Mama,

05:04.679 --> 05:06.472
this is all that's left.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.019
You can't save the Railroad.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.354
Mama was the Railroad.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.361
Hey, you need any help
on the Schmidt case?

05:20.445 --> 05:22.488
Nah, I just closed it. The neighbor.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.330
Never a murder when you want one, huh?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.373
I'd take anything.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.917
Second-degree murder. Manslaughter.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.003
A suicide that doesn't quite add up.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.715
-Dull.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.551
You learned how to be
a detective on the streets, am I right?

05:43.634 --> 05:45.011
No, no. Not at all.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.345
-Mmm-mmm.

05:46.429 --> 05:50.266
Everything I know,
I learned from... <i>L.A. Confidential.</i>

05:50.349 --> 05:51.559
Is that a podcast?

05:51.642 --> 05:53.019
Oh, God. How old am I?

05:53.811 --> 05:57.398
<i>L.A. Confidential,</i>
all-time great cop movie!

05:57.482 --> 05:59.776
1997, Curtis Hanson, RIP.

06:00.651 --> 06:03.988
You wanna watch it with me?
My place?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.365
Yeah.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.452
-Let's do it.
-Great.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.919
Liver appears normal.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.712
Yeah, same for her spleen.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.006
I don't expect we'll find
anything all that interesting

06:22.090 --> 06:24.634
with these bus crash victims.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.388
-I'm fine.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.973
I'm... I'm not fine.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.725
I barely knew Mama Leone,

06:32.809 --> 06:35.436
and I can't get the image
of her at the guillotine,

06:35.520 --> 06:39.023
with her brains spraying out
everywhere, out of my head.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.567
-People in the front row covered in--
-Really, Ravi. I'm fine.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.820
Hey, guys.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.822
-Liv, I need a favor.
-I'll do it.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.698
You might want to hear what it is first.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.576
Are these the bus crash victims?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.036
-Yeah.
-Great.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.539
So, one of the victims
stole a dog from his ex-wife.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.873
She's in desperate need to get it back.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.251
But the only person who knows
where the dog is now

06:58.334 --> 07:00.878
is the ex-husband, who's dead,

07:00.962 --> 07:02.713
and... somewhere in this.

07:02.797 --> 07:07.009
You want me to eat his brain
and see if I get a vision of the dog?

07:07.093 --> 07:09.637
I know this is a big ask.
But you know what my job is.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.597
People come to me
on the worst day of their lives,

07:11.681 --> 07:15.226
and I tell them that the city of New
Seattle is very sorry, but...

07:15.935 --> 07:17.478
So this dog...

07:18.896 --> 07:20.565
I just need a win.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.941
There's a little boy who misses him.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.193
So, let's find a dog.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.403
Thank you.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.239
His name's Denny Minnis.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.074
Mmm.

07:30.825 --> 07:31.868
Mmm-mmm.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.871
Denny Minnis was a heroin addict.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.331
If Liv eats his brain,

07:37.415 --> 07:38.958
she'll end up jonesing for a week.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.837
I'm not sending you into that hell.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.547
-Yeah.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.842
Thanks anyway,
but I better get back to work

07:47.925 --> 07:50.636
before the city falls into ruin.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.680
Thanks.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.934
I am hungry.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.979
Any bus brains
that won't have me chasing the dragon?

08:00.646 --> 08:03.524
Mmm. Let's see.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.667
Perfection.

08:21.959 --> 08:22.877
Mmm!

08:22.960 --> 08:24.712
Yum. What have you got there?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.174
My greatest role.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.139
Table 12 says
his prefrontal cortex lacks sapidity.

08:35.223 --> 08:38.059
Dude, scram, before you tank
our "A" sanitation rating.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.185
Who's this?

08:39.268 --> 08:41.145
I caught homes dumpster-diving out back

08:41.229 --> 08:43.189
and then he followed me in here
like a stray cat.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.150
Please, I'm starving, okay?
You've got so much.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.360
Do you have
your zombie ID card?

08:47.443 --> 08:48.361
Yeah.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.987
That'll get you brain rations.
Eat those.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.411
You wouldn't have cared for it.
It lacked sapidity.

08:57.495 --> 09:00.915
What would one wicked,
wanton wonton stuffed with balls of brains

09:00.998 --> 09:03.292
brined and braised harm the Almighty?

09:03.709 --> 09:04.794
Deep.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.088
Okay.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.423
Were you hoping to meet your maker soon,

09:09.507 --> 09:12.301
or, uh, would you like
to show yourself out?

09:16.013 --> 09:19.267
Great. The churchies have found us.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.936
-There goes the neighborhood.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.735
Oh, yeah, Swedish.
Plenty of hot rocks.

09:29.819 --> 09:35.074
And have the peeler get in there,
I want to be flayed alive. Thanks.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.245
Know what I'm doing tomorrow?

09:39.328 --> 09:41.038
Taking a super

09:41.122 --> 09:43.499
This week, in all of New Seattle,

09:43.583 --> 09:44.959
no one got murdered.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.669
So I'm off to the spa
for a Me-Day.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.296
Aww, a "Me

09:48.379 --> 09:50.214
I choose to ignore your tone.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.882
No, no, it's cool. I'd come with,

09:51.966 --> 09:53.384
but I'll be subduing terrorists,

09:53.467 --> 09:56.637
or dodging Molotov cocktails.
You know, stuff that men do.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.932
Please. I've seen
your, uh, skin-care collection.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.187
Have some of this.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.948
Oh, my God. That is fantastic.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.534
What is this, strawberry cream cheese?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.828
Actually, it's pulverized human brains.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.998
Oh, God. My monthlies.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.125
Is there any white showing yet?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.002
No, but you do seem emotional.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.631
Hey, make that face you made
when you realized you were eating brains.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.591
I want to send a pic
to Liv and Peyton.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.217
Peyton...

Good morning!

10:54.612 --> 10:56.530
You ready for the sexual
harassment seminar?

10:57.907 --> 11:01.452
<i>Three dead, seven wounded,</i>
<i>countless questions.</i>

11:01.535 --> 11:02.953
<i>Back to you, Sharon.</i>

11:03.704 --> 11:06.123
<i>Hey, Mark, you know what else</i>
<i>Sharon's been sharin'?</i>

11:06.207 --> 11:08.250
<i>Oh, hot damn.</i>

11:29.897 --> 11:32.108
Who remembers where they were
when they saw this?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.360
Pretty sure it was Seattle.

11:34.819 --> 11:38.155
Well, that's why I'm here today.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.408
Sexual harassment is no joke.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.327
Take it from someone
with 100 hours of court-ordered

11:43.494 --> 11:45.746
community service to show for it.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.874
Kinds of behavior considered harassment... Sexual jokes. Inappropriate touching.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.922
Spreading rumors
about a coworker's sex life.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.467
Now, who can tell me
whether the Seattle Police Department

11:58.551 --> 12:01.595
allows romantic relationships
in the workplace?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.848
Yes, you. The foxy lieutenant.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.767
It's allowed. You just have to
fill out the paperwork.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.893
Oh, all right.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.937
Did anyone go through that process?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.777
Detective Babineaux!

12:17.027 --> 12:18.988
Why don't you walk us
through the protocol, hmm?

12:20.948 --> 12:22.199
You, uh...

12:22.283 --> 12:23.492
Oh, stand up.
Stand up so we can all see you.

12:25.744 --> 12:26.829
Project.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.665
You fill out the forms.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.125
Which forms exactly?

12:32.710 --> 12:36.755
You go to Diana, in HR,
on the fifth floor. You tell her about--

12:36.839 --> 12:39.967
<i>♪ Go to Diana in HR ♪</i>

12:40.926 --> 12:43.721
<i>♪ And tell her</i>
<i>how you feel... ♪</i>

12:45.222 --> 12:47.391
She gives you a waiver for legal

12:47.475 --> 12:48.893
and an official declaration form.

12:48.976 --> 12:52.605
<i>♪ Once you declare</i>
<i>what's in your heart ♪</i>

12:52.688 --> 12:55.191
<i>♪ It means your love is real ♪</i>

12:59.195 --> 13:02.072
Now who is brave enough to act

13:02.156 --> 13:04.909
against a card-carrying
member of AFTRA?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.368
SAG

13:06.452 --> 13:08.204
Anyone else?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.915
Anyone? Oh, fine.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.169
This scenario will model
how to handle--

13:15.252 --> 13:17.505
<i>♪ Why fly so high? ♪</i>

13:17.588 --> 13:20.257
<i>♪ Whilst eating apples ♪</i>

13:20.341 --> 13:24.386
Miss Moore, aptly, will be playing
the part of Inappropriate Sue.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.847
What a to do to die today
at a minute or two to two.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.350
A distinctly difficult thing
to say but harder still to do.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.476
Stop. Stop it.

13:30.559 --> 13:33.270
Now watch how
my character handles

13:33.354 --> 13:35.648
Sue's inappropriate behavior.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.317
-All right, if you're ready--

13:38.400 --> 13:40.027
Nice. Tight.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.904
Like Inappropriate Sue prefers 'em.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.447
I'm on page six--

13:43.531 --> 13:46.200
Tall drink of water
like you shouldn't need to read.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.536
Let's just feel our way through it.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.037
I call this game "Chicken."

13:50.412 --> 13:51.747
I'm not comfortable with this.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.249
There. That was a real moment.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.625
Give me that again, from the top.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.669
What--

13:56.752 --> 13:58.337
Nice. Tight.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.548
Wait. No, we're not doing this.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.383
I like your lips.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.302
I like the shape they make
when you say no.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.055
Hey, you stop it.
You stop touching me!

14:08.138 --> 14:09.473
Yes. Mean it! Say no!

14:09.557 --> 14:10.724
No! I mean it!

14:11.267 --> 14:12.309
Scene!

14:28.617 --> 14:30.202
That's good.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.453
Here.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.248
Man, you do need that spa.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.419
No.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.964
I, uh... I ate the brain
of a heroin addict.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.799
I better hide my china white.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.134
You got some?

14:45.509 --> 14:47.177
Bucket, bucket, bucket.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.180
No, it passed.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.432
And you're doing this why?

14:51.515 --> 14:54.059
To help a friend in need. Ravi, she specifically said
not to do this.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.938
"She"?

14:58.689 --> 15:01.775
Ah! This is
an "Impress Peyton" thing.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.110
-Why did Peyton--
Ravi?

15:03.193 --> 15:05.237
-Have your roommate make sure

15:05.321 --> 15:07.072
you don't do anything dumb.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.699
In fact, give him your wallet.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.164
This seems like a bad idea.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.582
I'm fine.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.876
I'm better since I barfed.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.461
Wait, you're just gonna
leave him here?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.546
Well, this is where he lives.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.799
Unless you and your sandwich
have more important plans?

15:25.883 --> 15:26.926
Where are you off to?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.719
I'll be saving the world.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.350
-They're gonna die in there.
-I'm aware of that.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.603
We gotta do something.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.271
Like what?

15:53.369 --> 15:54.954
Good. You're all here.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.998
-Because the show must go on.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.668
People are dying out there
beyond the wall,

16:00.751 --> 16:02.378
but we have a chance
to save them.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.463
And by saving them, we have the chance

16:04.546 --> 16:07.007
to improve human-zombie relations.

16:07.091 --> 16:10.094
That means more brains
and fewer starving zombies.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.763
It's what Mama Leone wanted,
and it's what I want.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.181
Lady...

16:14.264 --> 16:17.226
We're kind of in the middle of
something right now. Okay?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.561
Yeah. Uh...

16:20.688 --> 16:23.857
Yesterday, we sent word
that the Underground Railroad's closed.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.360
One of our coyotes
didn't get the message in time. He shipped five humans in
by sea.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.280
They're in a shipping crate
at a shipyard

16:30.364 --> 16:32.449
and we've lost our means
for getting them out.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.243
Two of Mama's people
drive a cargo truck.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.953
Their job takes 'em to the shipyard.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.707
Our trucker friends
smuggle people into the city, but...

16:39.790 --> 16:41.208
After what happened to Mama...

16:41.291 --> 16:42.960
Our trucker friends bailed.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.586
And the five humans?

16:44.670 --> 16:45.671
Trapped.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.756
They'll die in there unless we save them.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.175
Security on the marina is tight.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.927
There's gates. Cameras.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.471
Guards everywhere,
ordered to shoot on sight.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.848
It's a suicide mission.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.981
And what would Mama have done?

17:05.065 --> 17:06.525
Mama knew the risks.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.737
She kept doing what she did.

17:11.780 --> 17:16.452
What we do, right now,
determines whether she died in vain.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.205
I say, hell no, she didn't.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.167
<i>We save these people</i>
<i>or we die trying.</i>

17:28.297 --> 17:30.049
Are we good
or do we need that in a wide?

17:37.848 --> 17:39.808
<i>So, how are you holding up?</i>

17:43.520 --> 17:45.189
<i>Okay. Give me your line again.</i>

17:46.607 --> 17:47.775
<i>So, how are you holding up?</i>

17:47.858 --> 17:50.903
<i>There's no time to be tired.</i>

17:52.863 --> 17:54.323
That was good.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.158
Your friends aren't wrong, you know.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.452
If this footage ends up
in the wrong hands,

17:58.535 --> 18:00.704
everyone on it could get executed.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.206
You could get executed.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.209
Oh, my God, you're right.
What the hell am I thinking?

18:07.086 --> 18:10.380
Okay... Why are you doing this?

18:10.506 --> 18:11.715
Uh...

18:12.132 --> 18:13.801
Can you say "Academy Award"?

18:16.386 --> 18:18.222
Okay. Um...

18:19.139 --> 18:21.225
It's what I do. I'm a filmmaker.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.936
So when a friend of mine
got trapped outside the wall,

18:24.019 --> 18:26.522
and Mama Leone...

18:26.980 --> 18:30.359
Got him back to his family,
I asked Mama if I could--

18:30.442 --> 18:32.027
I know how to pull this off.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.404
Get everyone here by 4:00 p.m.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.866
I need to go get props and costumes.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.374
You're here. Thank God.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.876
Yeah, I'm here
and I'm having a heart attack.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.170
An SOS text
at 2:00 in the morning

18:50.254 --> 18:52.131
I've got work, and Ravi can't be alone.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.175
-He already got into the medicine cabinet.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.761
I had to pry a bottle of
cough syrup away from him.

18:57.845 --> 18:58.929
He bit me.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.140
I think he stole
my only other work uniform

19:01.223 --> 19:02.432
but won't tell me where he put it.

19:02.516 --> 19:06.103
He offered to "pleasure me"
for my car keys.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.313
Yeah, I think he was kidding,

19:08.397 --> 19:10.607
but I'm only 60% sure.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.193
I'm lost. What's wrong with Ravi?

19:13.277 --> 19:14.862
He ate some junkie's brain.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.947
I thought he did it for you.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.615
He did?

19:19.158 --> 19:20.409
Hey, it's me.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.619
You okay?

19:24.705 --> 19:27.875
This was a really
sweet gesture, but heroin brain...

19:29.960 --> 19:31.128
Ravi?

19:41.513 --> 19:42.931
Stupid junkie.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.392
What?

19:45.559 --> 19:46.602
Heroin.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.690
I would like... some heroin.

19:51.773 --> 19:54.610
All right. Far be it from me to,

19:54.693 --> 19:58.113
you know, care,
but that's a really bad drug.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.366
-Are you sure you--
-I saved your life!

20:01.450 --> 20:05.704
The least you can do is go out
and get me some smack!

20:05.787 --> 20:07.080
You got it.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.751
Blaine!

20:10.834 --> 20:13.503
So, you're a heroin addict now? Oh, like you're such a saint.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.841
No judgment.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.135
-Well, I've just started.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.096
I've always been curious.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.391
God, it's freezing in here.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.185
-Look who's here.
-Oh, thank God.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.436
I got here as fast as I could.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.230
Not you. You got the stuff?

20:33.815 --> 20:35.776
Eat it. This has gone way too far.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.528
I'm fine, I'll be fine.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.613
Ravi.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.701
I can... I can do this.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.372
Just... Just take me home.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.040
Are you sure?

20:50.540 --> 20:53.961
With you... I'm sure.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.342
But if I could just get
a little bit of heroin...

21:03.011 --> 21:04.846
I could go on the stakeout, too,

21:04.930 --> 21:06.056
extra pair of eyes.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.891
Read a book, Babineaux.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.978
Just enjoy your downtime.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.565
-Oh, hey, uh, Michelle...
-No, I'm busy.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.109
Please. You deserve an explanation.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.443
I think I'm pretty clear on everything.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.237
-So, go then.

21:20.988 --> 21:21.989
Oh.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.741
So, Lieutenant Bozzio and I...

21:27.869 --> 21:29.162
Let's go in here.

21:37.921 --> 21:41.091
Okay. So yeah, I know
how that must've looked.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.343
That you were planning on cheating on
your live

21:43.427 --> 21:44.970
Yeah, like that.

21:45.053 --> 21:48.557
Lieutenant Bozzio and I are
in an open relationship.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.686
We weren't always,
but once she became a zombie...

21:53.645 --> 21:55.689
You know,
zombies and humans can't...

21:58.984 --> 22:00.569
I love Dale.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.363
That's where I was out of line,
I should've led with my deal first,

22:03.447 --> 22:05.282
but to be honest,

22:05.365 --> 22:07.075
I don't know how to bring it up.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.329
I haven't even played the field yet.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.705
Or whatever.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.623
This is awkward. Anyway,

22:14.416 --> 22:15.459
I'm sorry.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.003
All right.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.714
-Yeah, we're good.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.884
Don't take that the wrong way.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.471
All the best,
but that's not my scene.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.931
I'm looking for something real.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.433
Yeah, of course. I get it.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.603
I hope you find it.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.313
Oh, I will.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.608
Good luck, Clive.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.293
-Eat the tube.
-No.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.379
-Here.
-No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

23:06.760 --> 23:11.473
So I'm getting very familiar
with, um, dog-movie cliches now.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.391
What, like, "Timmy's in the well"?

23:13.475 --> 23:15.519
That's the classic.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.479
And then there's this one.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.524
Dogs are always trying to
get home to their owners,

23:20.899 --> 23:23.860
and somehow they always manage
to hop on trains, just like--

23:25.904 --> 23:27.030
A vision!

23:27.114 --> 23:29.407
Come on, baby. Find that dog.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.705
I saw the dog.
I know where he is.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.249
Okay.

23:39.751 --> 23:40.877
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.462
We're here. What's the plan?

23:42.879 --> 23:43.922
Uh...

23:50.137 --> 23:51.555
"Cast list."

23:51.638 --> 23:53.223
Find your roles.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.144
If it's a smaller part
than you'd hoped, I don't care.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.688
There are no small parts, people.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.316
Where'd you get this?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.776
"Lillywhite."

24:04.860 --> 24:08.363
We don't touch the costumes
until we've become the characters.

24:08.905 --> 24:10.198
Your lines are highlighted.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.492
There's a character description at the top

24:12.576 --> 24:14.494
to help you get your bearings.

24:16.913 --> 24:21.585
"Bald, ethnic, street tough.
Think Pitbull."

24:21.668 --> 24:23.879
Pitbull. Argh!

24:23.962 --> 24:25.755
This

24:25.839 --> 24:28.592
Look, I'm not risking my life
for some theater class bull--

24:28.675 --> 24:30.802
Cops! Get down!

24:33.805 --> 24:35.348
Lesson number one...

24:36.474 --> 24:39.519
If you believe it,
the audience believes it.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.941
You have heard of the boy
that cried wolf, right?

24:45.025 --> 24:47.360
Since the day
that you joined Mama's network,

24:47.444 --> 24:50.113
you've been acting. Now, have a seat.

24:51.489 --> 24:52.908
Who are my cops?

24:55.035 --> 24:56.036
Okay.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.455
Who're you playing?

24:58.538 --> 25:00.790
An amazing role, thank you for asking.

25:00.874 --> 25:03.835
She has many layers to her

25:03.919 --> 25:07.088
and a very difficult accent,

25:07.172 --> 25:10.133
because we challenge
the audience

25:10.217 --> 25:12.052
when we challenge ourselves.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.975
"Fade in. Exterior, a lonely road.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.645
A meteor streaks across the sky.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.773
An unmarked police car
flashes its cherry top,

25:24.856 --> 25:25.982
pulls over a semi.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.901
A policeman emerges. He taps the semi's window."

25:32.155 --> 25:33.782
Oh, uh, uh...

25:34.616 --> 25:36.701
"License and registration."

25:37.202 --> 25:39.537
Um... "Baron pulls out a gun..."

25:40.288 --> 25:41.831
"Get out of the truck."

25:42.457 --> 25:44.084
Wait, we're jacking a truck?

25:44.668 --> 25:46.002
Not anymore, we're not.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.088
-I thought the plan was--
-Yeah, that was the plan,

25:48.171 --> 25:49.839
and then I saw this.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.384
Excuse me?

25:52.467 --> 25:53.927
"Get out of the truck."

25:55.345 --> 25:56.763
It was my first time, man.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.808
"Watch out, Fillmore Graves.
I'm pointing my finger at you."

26:01.559 --> 26:03.395
-Whoa!

26:03.478 --> 26:04.938
Yes! Now gimme the line.

26:05.021 --> 26:05.981
"Get out of the truck!"

26:06.231 --> 26:07.649
Where's my second hijacker?

26:07.732 --> 26:09.567
"Do what we say...

26:09.943 --> 26:11.695
Do what we say
and you won't get--"

26:11.778 --> 26:13.697
"Get on your knees, fool!"

26:13.780 --> 26:16.032
Baron is blowing you off
the stage right now, Stan,

26:16.116 --> 26:17.534
and you're just letting it happen!

26:17.617 --> 26:18.702
He's going off-script.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.912
Screw the lines!
Just get the meaning across.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.205
Yeah.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.501
You sons of bitches
better give us your keys, or your brains are zombie paste!

26:28.837 --> 26:29.796
I like it.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.756
Okay. Uh-uh!

26:32.048 --> 26:35.343
"Baron and Stan drive away in
their stolen big rig," yada, yada, yada.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.138
Here we go. Scene three.

26:39.222 --> 26:41.766
<i>The UFreightEze truck</i>
<i>rolls up to the shipyard gate.</i>

26:46.563 --> 26:47.981
<i>A guard approaches.</i> <i>Suki hands him a manifest.</i>

26:49.566 --> 26:50.984
You're not the usual guy.

26:51.067 --> 26:54.112
Yeah. Well, he's down with that bug
that's been going around, so...

26:55.363 --> 26:56.698
Hmm. Shut off your engine.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.533
Say what?

26:58.616 --> 27:00.327
Protocol says I need
advance warning of a driver change.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.121
I gotta call this in,
so you're gonna shut off your engine.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.183
Hey!

27:25.060 --> 27:26.061
What, you hate women?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.312
Lady, protocol says--

27:27.395 --> 27:29.564
Kiss my ass
with your friggin' protocol. Okay?

27:31.983 --> 27:34.069
"Is there anything wrong
with my truck?"

27:34.152 --> 27:35.445
Is there anything wrong with my truck?

27:36.154 --> 27:37.864
Anything wrong with my manifest?

27:37.947 --> 27:39.032
No.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.950
"I gotta get home to my wife, man."

27:41.034 --> 27:42.827
I gotta get home to my wife, man.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.538
"She punishes me
when I've been bad."

27:45.622 --> 27:46.748
She punishes--

27:47.832 --> 27:49.084
-Screw you.
-Here.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.127
Bay three.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.631
Freakin' patriarchy!

27:56.049 --> 27:57.133
Nice ad lib.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.725
Hey, fellas. How's it hanging?

28:06.476 --> 28:07.811
You're ready to load us up?

28:07.894 --> 28:10.188
Ugh! Take your time.

28:10.271 --> 28:11.648
My wife's on the warpath.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.234
The longer I'm away from home,
the better.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.088
I'm sorry to bother you.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.256
Can I use your phone?

28:36.339 --> 28:37.715
I was out on a date with this guy,

28:37.799 --> 28:40.760
and he pulled over
into a car park, and he wanted me to...

28:40.844 --> 28:42.679
Oh, gosh, um... I'd like to help you

28:42.762 --> 28:43.972
but we're kinda not allowed to let--

28:44.055 --> 28:45.432
He threw me out of the car
when I wouldn't--

28:45.515 --> 28:47.892
And I don't know where I am,
I have no reception,

28:47.976 --> 28:49.561
it's past curfew.

28:50.311 --> 28:51.813
Maybe just for a second.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.859
Why don't I ever date
nice guys?

28:55.942 --> 28:57.485
Yeah, the...

28:57.569 --> 28:58.570
The phone's right there.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.155
I just need to call my girlfriend.

29:00.697 --> 29:03.825
She works at the mayor's
office, so she can be out whenever.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.289
Peyton, it's me.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.458
Sorry to call so late.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.210
I need a ride.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.670
Tonight's been a bloody 'mare.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.213
<i>I'm at the marina.</i>

29:17.297 --> 29:18.840
Good job.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.175
I'm still lookin'.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.552
Thanks.

29:23.511 --> 29:24.721
<i>The sooner the better.</i>

29:25.805 --> 29:28.266
-Jerry!
-Yo!

29:28.349 --> 29:29.392
You get next week's shifts yet?

29:29.476 --> 29:30.602
Not yet.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.649
-No.

29:36.733 --> 29:37.817
One more guess.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.153
Then it's gotta be New Zealand.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.405
You're a real GC, aren't you?

29:42.489 --> 29:44.157
You know, a lot of people
from the States

29:44.240 --> 29:45.533
have never even heard of us.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.701
Are you kidding?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.495
They shot<i> Lord Of The Rings</i> there!

29:48.578 --> 29:50.622
Sorry, one sec.

29:50.705 --> 29:51.790
I... I was in it.

29:53.082 --> 29:54.793
Get out!

29:55.502 --> 29:56.503
Are you a fan

29:57.670 --> 30:00.006
Is the Witch

30:00.089 --> 30:01.216
He sure is.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.134
This is amazing. I'm freaking out.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.719
-Uh, a small part.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.095
Just blink and you miss it.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.848
I said that I've seen

30:08.932 --> 30:10.099
the movie a thousand times in Elvish.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.644
So, trust me, I'll remember.
Who were you?

30:13.144 --> 30:14.521
Elves have a word for "movie"?

30:14.604 --> 30:17.273
I use the word for "story," but--
So, who were you?

30:17.357 --> 30:18.399
An elf.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.276
I knew it. I love the elves.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.237
With Galadriel

30:23.112 --> 30:24.572
Are you in the Battle of Pelennor Fields?

30:30.411 --> 30:31.621
What's that?

30:32.914 --> 30:34.666
-No. Came in last week.

30:36.584 --> 30:37.794
Jerry got one.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.261
Come on, lemme hear.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.638
I'm warning you. I'm awful.

30:48.721 --> 30:50.431
-One sentence.
-Okay, you asked for it.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.809
Hey, fellers. I'm an American.

30:53.184 --> 30:56.813
I've never had a passport,
and watery beer is the best.

30:56.896 --> 31:01.943
Wow, you are so bad
at an American accent.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.946
I should get back to work.

31:05.613 --> 31:08.199
Do you, uh...
Wanna see something?

31:13.454 --> 31:14.289
Uh...

31:15.623 --> 31:16.833
My grandfather's flask.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.294
Up for some shots?

31:20.003 --> 31:21.629
We're just being crazy.

31:21.713 --> 31:22.839
Cheers!

31:54.162 --> 31:55.538
Let's get you home.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.582
You're all set.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.876
Too damn fast if you ask me.

31:59.959 --> 32:00.793
All right. You have a good one, now.

32:05.632 --> 32:10.303
And what the hell does Andy Serkis have to
do to get an Oscar?

32:10.386 --> 32:13.348
Um, I can read palms.
Do you want a reading?

32:13.431 --> 32:14.766
Yeah.

32:14.849 --> 32:16.100
I see...

32:17.226 --> 32:19.103
A career change.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.271
A promotion?

32:21.522 --> 32:25.693
Um... What does it say about, uh, love?

32:38.498 --> 32:39.791
I gotta...

32:40.541 --> 32:41.751
I gotta get that.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.711
Yeah.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.509
Uh... What?

33:08.528 --> 33:09.821
She'll be here.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.198
So will half of Seattle.

33:12.281 --> 33:14.659
Those offices open up in an hour.

33:14.742 --> 33:16.577
We need to get these people underground.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.162
The sick ones need their z-scratch.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.372
I can do it. No.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.792
Your girl talked big.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.169
I want to see
if she's got stones to match.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.671
We're about to find out.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.639
Sorry I'm late.
I thought I was being followed.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.724
You sure you lost them?

33:37.807 --> 33:39.600
I wouldn't be here if I weren't sure.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.061
Let's do this.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.272
Showtime.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.817
If I film this,

33:47.900 --> 33:50.820
that's you on tape
committing a capital offense.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.538
Okay.

34:10.631 --> 34:11.799
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:16.971 --> 34:18.389
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:24.270 --> 34:25.563
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

34:35.656 --> 34:36.866
Thank you.

34:38.534 --> 34:39.619
Bless you.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.710
We gotta get out of here.

34:50.171 --> 34:51.798
Well, we'd miss the best part.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.430
Mommy!

35:09.482 --> 35:11.067
Nice work, Renegade.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.241
-Come on in.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.618
Ajax!

35:28.334 --> 35:29.502
Thank you.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.014
Hey.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.141
Hey.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.688
Well, here for <i>Air Bud 3,</i> are we?

35:58.489 --> 35:59.824
All better?

35:59.907 --> 36:01.492
Yeah, getting there.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.511
What can I say, Pops?
I'm riding high.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.555
Romero's is booked solid.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.807
The Post is rakin' it in
every night.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.267
We've got a Scrooge McDuck room

36:26.350 --> 36:28.936
where I just roll around
on freshly laundered cash.

36:30.688 --> 36:33.149
Any zombie who's anyone
in this town kisses my ass.

36:33.232 --> 36:35.193
-They just pucker up and...

36:38.696 --> 36:40.031
Yeah?

36:41.365 --> 36:42.533
Just tell them that--

36:42.950 --> 36:45.161
Fine, I'm coming.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.249
Man, I wish
you could see my new whip.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.792
I love you.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.670
Mean it.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.047
Ciao.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.716
You know this thing's
got turbo boosts, like, in video games?

36:59.217 --> 37:00.468
We have to swing by Romero's.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.136
Apparently,
there's a bunch of undesirables

37:02.220 --> 37:04.388
having a sit-down strike
in our dining room.

37:11.103 --> 37:14.232
Sir, I'm sorry,
we tried everything. They won't leave.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.901
Raise your hand if you can
afford to eat here.

37:18.444 --> 37:19.820
Not a shock.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.907
Guys, there's a soup kitchen
with your name on it.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.408
<i>Vamonos.</i>

37:25.409 --> 37:27.578
You heard the man! Shoo!

37:27.662 --> 37:29.372
Skedaddle!

37:29.455 --> 37:30.957
Chop chop!

37:31.040 --> 37:32.041
Folks...

37:34.168 --> 37:39.090
I really don't want to
have to shoot anybody in the face today.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.348
That's my son.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.394
Just look at you.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.896
You've done well.

37:54.730 --> 37:57.733
And Blaine's worked for it.
My boy's got grit.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.694
Nothing keeps us McDonoughs down!

37:59.777 --> 38:01.862
Not even a block of cement.

38:03.614 --> 38:07.535
The well gives shape to the water.

38:07.618 --> 38:10.454
The water gives life to the well.

38:10.538 --> 38:14.208
Like the bubble, I am born to rise.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.210
So we rise.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.879
Yeah, that's not creepy.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.719
What do you want?

38:25.261 --> 38:27.930
In the dark, my one solace

38:28.014 --> 38:31.434
was when the watery skies
would open and I would be fed.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.687
Brain-drops falling on my head.

38:35.896 --> 38:38.274
And now I'd like you

38:38.357 --> 38:41.319
to perform the very same
sacrament for my flock.

38:41.819 --> 38:46.198
We will come here once a week,
and you will feed us.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.994
And will my brothers
and sisters be paying?

38:50.077 --> 38:52.580
Son. You don't pay
for family dinner.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.586
Mondays. Lunch.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.422
Make it a standing reservation.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.090
Your weekly gift to the poor.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.592
Yay, me.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.970
Son...

39:10.556 --> 39:11.891
I forgive you.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.810
You forgive me?

39:19.190 --> 39:21.233
You forgive me?

39:23.194 --> 39:25.279
I will kill you. You hear me?

39:25.571 --> 39:26.781
I will kill you!

39:26.864 --> 39:28.532
I will make it hurt.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.451
So you keep smiling.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.662
You keep smiling,
you child-abusing son of a bitch.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.253
It's one meal a week.

39:42.254 --> 39:44.590
The Lord will shine His light on you.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.606
Dino got him out.

40:00.689 --> 40:03.234
He's the only one who knew.
Find him and deal with him.

40:03.317 --> 40:04.693
Yeah, you don't have to ask me twice.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.320
What about these guys?

40:07.154 --> 40:09.073
Serve 'em the cheap stuff. -Hey.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.457
Yeah.

40:20.626 --> 40:23.295
E-mails, letters, recorded phone calls

40:23.379 --> 40:27.800
from people who want a ride
on our Underground Railroad.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.594
Mama always handled them. So...

40:33.848 --> 40:36.308
There's about 300 candidates on there.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.018
How many can we help?

40:38.394 --> 40:39.687
Right now? Pick three.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.484
Take your time.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.570
You got this.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.995
<i>A baby with spina bifida.</i>

40:56.328 --> 40:58.164
<i>A young man with Lou Gehrig's.</i>

40:58.956 --> 41:01.333
<i>A grandmother</i>
<i>with the first signs of Alzheimer's.</i>

41:02.168 --> 41:06.046
<i>Every person here needs us.</i>
<i>They all deserve help.</i>

41:06.130 --> 41:09.550
<i>And I decide who lives,</i>
<i>and whose story ends.</i>

41:12.219 --> 41:13.762
<i>I wanted to help the living.</i>

41:13.846 --> 41:15.556
<i>I wanted in.</i>

41:15.639 --> 41:18.267
<i>Well... I'm in it now.</i>
