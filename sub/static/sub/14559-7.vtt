WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.072
* I'm coming up on infra-red *

00:04.138 --> 00:08.876
* There is no running
that can hide you *

00:08.942 --> 00:12.313
* 'Cause I can see in the dark *

00:12.380 --> 00:15.583
* I'm coming up on infra-red *

00:15.649 --> 00:20.788
* Forget your running,
I will find you *

00:20.854 --> 00:23.224
* Find you...

00:23.291 --> 00:25.426
(instrumental)

00:26.294 --> 00:29.430
(distorted singing)

00:40.674 --> 00:47.548
* So I came down to crash and
burn your beggars banquet *

00:47.615 --> 00:50.284
* Someone call the ambulance

00:50.351 --> 00:54.855
* There's gonna be an accident *

00:54.922 --> 00:56.390
(device ringing)

01:01.962 --> 01:02.930
* I'm coming up on infra-red *

01:02.996 --> 01:07.601
* Forget your running,
I will find you now *

01:07.668 --> 01:11.172
(sirens blaring)
* I will find you...

01:11.239 --> 01:12.240
(garbled radio transmission)

01:12.306 --> 01:14.542
I got a 35-year-old
white male.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.145
Pushed or jumped off the south
side of this building

01:17.211 --> 01:18.546
90 minutes ago.

01:18.612 --> 01:19.613
Dead on impact.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.881
Any witnesses?

01:20.948 --> 01:22.216
No, but they
ID'd him.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.718
He's the Assistant US
Attorney Peter Weyburn

01:24.785 --> 01:27.321
from the Tenth Circuit
in Kansas.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.923
Yeah, that's a long way
to come to commit suicide.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.193
I'd say, for an unmarried
civil servant

01:32.260 --> 01:35.329
in the tax department,
perfectly clean record.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.030
His family,
his office has no idea

01:37.097 --> 01:38.266
what he was doing in California.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.234
Let's see if we can find out
why he was here,

01:40.301 --> 01:41.435
and if anyone had
any grudges...

01:41.502 --> 01:43.204
Where's Liz? I thought
she was filling in for David.

01:43.271 --> 01:46.174
Yeah, in-service training.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.510
CHARLIE:
Listen, I can't talk right now.

01:49.577 --> 01:50.911
I'll call you back.

01:50.978 --> 01:51.879
Hi.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.081
My publicist wants me to
do interviews, you know?

01:54.148 --> 01:55.249
Mm-hmm.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.450
And I told her, I said,

01:56.517 --> 01:59.019
I can't start the book tour
till next week.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.221
Uh, that's because

02:00.288 --> 02:01.622
The Attraction
Equation is blowing up.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.957
I checked.
It's on the top 100 on Amazon.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.159
It made the top 100?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.160
Can I leave
this stuff here,

02:06.227 --> 02:08.462
because, um, I-I don't want
to take it to my class,

02:08.529 --> 02:09.963
and I'm running
really late.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.799
What do you mean, you don't want
your students wondering

02:11.865 --> 02:13.267
why you bring fancy underwear
to work?

02:13.334 --> 02:14.335
No. Thank you.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.069
I would prefer they stay focused

02:16.136 --> 02:17.405
on the combinatorial
matrix theory.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.207
Um, your dad is going to
be gone tonight, right?

02:19.273 --> 02:20.341
- Mm-hmm.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.009
So we have the house to
ourselves?

02:22.075 --> 02:23.344
I've been thinking.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.646
Why don't you move in
with me already?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.383
You mean, with-with
the both of you?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.018
Well, my father
won't mind.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.486
We can work that out.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.388
Is it something
you'd want to do?

02:34.455 --> 02:37.157
Yeah, um, it just...

02:37.225 --> 02:40.027
You know, Charlie, this is not
just a romantic question.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.663
I mean, this is something
we need to talk about

02:42.730 --> 02:44.765
when our heads are
clear, and we're calm,

02:44.832 --> 02:47.134
and I-I'm not calm right
now, because I'm running

02:47.201 --> 02:49.237
really, really, really, really,
really late to class. Okay.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.305
All right. Hey.
Hi.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.273
Welcome back.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.275
So, I'll see you
at lunch?

02:54.342 --> 02:55.676
Bye. Bye.
Bye.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.345
Bye.
Hey.

02:57.411 --> 03:01.715
Charles, you look like
someone stole your chalk.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.284
Welcome back.
Well, look,

03:03.351 --> 03:05.853
I agreed to teach one seminar
this term.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.255
You're moving out
of the monastery.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.956
Yeah.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.526
One stride at a time.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.961
Come on.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.329
More conscious
walking?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.898
You know, a visiting
Vietnamese monk,

03:17.965 --> 03:19.700
he led us on a conscious walk.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.303
It took us three hours
just to cross the garden.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.771
Three hours?

03:23.837 --> 03:26.173
Well, I mean, deliberating
upon each single step,

03:26.240 --> 03:27.941
it slows the metabolism,
deepens the focus.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.612
It's more mundanely, it helps
you sidestep dog excrement.

03:31.679 --> 03:32.946
- Ha!
- It's a most worthy exercise.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.249
Sometimes I think you're
better off taking the leap.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.384
Oh, how I've dreaded
this moment.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.952
Okay. Here it is,
just like you left it.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.188
Okay. Oh.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.957
Oh. Oh, my.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.294
I-I cannot take
one more step.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.761
Well, what's the matter?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.330
I'm overwhelmed.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.365
I'm literally
overwhelmed.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.666
Oh, the memories?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.603
For five months,
I've needed nothing

03:55.669 --> 03:57.137
that I couldn't
carry on my back.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.940
This... this
is obscene.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.311
Who is this person that
belongs to this mess?

04:03.377 --> 04:05.646
Uh, uh...

04:09.483 --> 04:12.085
COLBY:
Don, I got something.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.422
What have you got?

04:14.488 --> 04:18.025
Well, looks like
a bunch of kids stuff.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.061
I'm guessing someone who lives
in the building put it up here.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.730
Well, log it in anyway,
you know?

04:22.796 --> 04:24.965
I'm within my right, according
to California Statutes...

04:25.032 --> 04:26.066
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.701
Hold-hold on there.
What-what's going on?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.202
MEGAN:
This is Anthony Braxton.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.071
He was sneaking up here
from the next building over.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.673
Sneaking is not accurate.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.308
I'm in pursuit of
the Primal Key.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.309
What?

04:35.376 --> 04:36.810
BRAXTON:
You found the GPS-cache.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.512
Do you know
if Weyburn got to it?

04:38.579 --> 04:39.947
Wait. You know
who Weyburn is?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.114
Yes.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.050
- He's the head of our alliance.
- What alliance?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.718
The Midwestern Ax-Butchers.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.087
Primacy.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.323
The MMO?

04:50.424 --> 04:52.426
It's a PVP RPG

04:52.493 --> 04:55.496
with an integrated ARG
in its last 72 hours.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.964
What are you talking,
like video game stuff?

04:57.030 --> 04:59.066
Yeah, a video game. We're
competing in an ARG endgame

04:59.132 --> 05:00.401
for a million-dollar prize.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.469
Ho-ho-hold on.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.836
What? Get off of me, man!

05:02.903 --> 05:04.538
Where's Peter?

05:04.605 --> 05:06.340
Mr. Weyburn's dead.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.509
What?

05:08.576 --> 05:11.912
Wait. Is-is this real?

05:11.979 --> 05:15.148
You mean, you mean dead,
like his physical body is...

05:15.215 --> 05:16.650
Yeah, like in real life.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.620
Whoa.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.722
I've never seen an actual
dead person before.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.957
I've, I've killed
thousands online, but...

05:24.024 --> 05:25.793
So, you didn't
like the idea of splitting

05:25.859 --> 05:27.395
the prize money with him,
is that it, Anthony?

05:27.461 --> 05:28.429
What?

05:28.496 --> 05:29.730
Where were you
for the last two hours?

05:29.797 --> 05:31.632
BRAXTON: I'm on his team.
I wouldn't do anything...

05:31.699 --> 05:32.866
Anthony, what is this?
(device trilling)

05:32.933 --> 05:34.635
That's just my handheld
electronic reader.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.705
Aim it around.
(trilling)

05:37.771 --> 05:40.408
Aim it at the bottom
right corner

05:40.474 --> 05:43.677
of that graphic
across the street.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.913
DON:
Whoa. What is this?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.881
Alternate reality.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.864
(indistinct conversation)

06:06.434 --> 06:08.035
MEGAN:
Charlie, I am, like,

06:08.101 --> 06:09.470
halfway through your book,

06:09.537 --> 06:11.371
and your stuff on relationships
is just great.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.540
Thanks.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.907
Amita, thanks so much
for coming down.

06:13.974 --> 06:14.875
Sure.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.877
Well, just eyeballing
it, I can tell you

06:16.944 --> 06:19.780
that unless this guy got a
running start, he was pushed.

06:19.847 --> 06:20.714
Who was he?

06:20.781 --> 06:22.450
Uh, the Assistant
US District Attorney

06:22.516 --> 06:24.017
Peter Weyburn,
he's from Kansas,

06:24.084 --> 06:26.520
and we'd really like to rule out
a suicide if possible.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.756
- Well, we'll take a look at it.
- Okay.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.591
Uh, he was here
playing some kind

06:30.658 --> 06:32.159
of an alternate
reality game.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.661
It's called Privacy?

06:33.727 --> 06:34.895
Primacy?

06:34.962 --> 06:35.963
You know it?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.731
- Yeah, I play it.
- You do?

06:37.798 --> 06:39.700
Yeah, since
I was an undergraduate.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.768
What can you tell me about it?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.836
The alternate reality game
is temporary.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.406
It's used to promote the MMORPG,
which goes on for years.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.941
The MMO what?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.810
The Massively Multiplayer
Online Role Playing Game.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.645
You know, basically,
you're a character,

06:51.712 --> 06:53.313
and you fight in battles

06:53.380 --> 06:54.982
and go on quests,
stuff like that.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.084
You know, Amita, I think
you're going to be better

06:57.150 --> 06:58.686
at decoding this
crime scene than I am.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.120
You guys want to head up,

07:00.187 --> 07:01.755
and I'll let them know you're
coming?

07:01.822 --> 07:02.656
Sure.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.124
Hey, how do I not
know this about you?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.293
Oh, 'cause we only play
a few hours a week.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.394
Uh, who's we? We who?

07:07.461 --> 07:08.562
Uh, me and my alliance.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.864
So, an alliance.
Well, what-what... How...

07:10.931 --> 07:12.600
You-you never told me
you had an alliance.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.234
What is... what
is an alliance?

07:14.301 --> 07:15.936
Uh, just old friends, you know.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.671
We've been playing
the video part

07:17.738 --> 07:19.473
of Primacy for years,
since we were undergrads.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.141
It helps us keep in touch.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.811
How come you never asked me
to be part of your alliance?

07:23.877 --> 07:25.946
Well, honestly, I thought
you would make fun of me.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.414
I mean, it's kind of whimsical.

07:27.481 --> 07:30.283
Well, I can be
extremely whimsical.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.253
I do lots of things on a whim.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.988
COLBY:
Hey, you guys.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.289
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.592
I have no idea what
I'm looking at here.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.360
She does.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.829
What's the deal?

07:41.895 --> 07:44.364
An alternate reality game--
ARG--

07:44.431 --> 07:46.466
is a treasure hunt played out
in the real world,

07:46.534 --> 07:47.835
using actual media.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.670
Well, give me a good old-
fashioned foot chase any day.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.705
Now, what is
this thing?

07:51.772 --> 07:54.041
Okay, well, this device
is an optical scanner

07:54.107 --> 07:56.343
with software downloaded
from the game company.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.878
You see, a lot of gamers

07:57.945 --> 07:59.446
just use cell phone cameras,
but...

07:59.513 --> 08:00.581
(trilling)

08:00.648 --> 08:01.915
The numbers are a clue in.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.852
If it were a Web site,
it would log on automatically,

08:04.918 --> 08:07.220
letting the game mainframe
know where I'm located

08:07.287 --> 08:08.656
and giving me points,

08:08.722 --> 08:10.423
but it's not
doing that, so

08:10.490 --> 08:11.925
it could be GPS.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.227
Or quite possibly a simple
hexadecimal alphabet code

08:14.294 --> 08:16.997
that translates
to "the beach."

08:17.064 --> 08:18.999
Hmm. Maybe you should
be part of my alliance.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.568
I'm going to start
my own alliance.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.102
COLBY:
And you just did that

08:22.169 --> 08:23.771
in your head like that?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.706
I wouldn't be as fast
in a foot chase.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.975
What do we think
the shape means?

08:28.041 --> 08:30.377
- Argentina?
AMITA: I'm thinking

08:30.443 --> 08:33.280
it's the map of some zip code
area that includes a beach.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.217
You see, alliances follow clues
online and in the real world

08:37.284 --> 08:38.485
to locate the Primal Key.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.520
The Primal Key?

08:40.588 --> 08:41.822
Yeah. A hidden object.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.523
It's the Holy Grail
of the game.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.892
It's worth a
million bucks.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.459
How many people
do you think

08:46.526 --> 08:47.695
are competing
for it?

08:47.761 --> 08:49.296
I don't know.
I would guess several thousand.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.497
Oh, that's a lot
of suspects.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.865
Well, correct me
if I'm incorrect,

08:51.932 --> 08:54.568
but we could develop
an evolutionary algorithm

08:54.635 --> 08:56.036
that searches the game's history

08:56.103 --> 08:57.971
for abnormally
aggressive activity.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.506
Aggression's part
of the game.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.909
Killing real people isn't,
right?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.343
Yeah, that's true.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.012
People aggress in video games
in similar ways--

09:05.078 --> 09:06.747
killing monsters,
going on raids.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.682
Yeah, see, and this algorithm
would recognize

09:08.749 --> 09:10.250
any typical activity
and just ignore it.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.552
It would seek out
the abnormal actions.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.055
Uh, think of a pond.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.890
A pond is a healthy ecosystem

09:16.957 --> 09:18.859
where predator and prey
are in balance.

09:18.926 --> 09:22.763
However, if an outside predator
is introduced,

09:22.830 --> 09:23.997
well, then,
the ecosystem changes.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.934
An evolutionary
algorithm highlights

09:27.000 --> 09:28.401
abnormal alterations.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.138
It discerns subtle patterns
and locates

09:31.204 --> 09:32.405
the source of a problem.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.107
Well, then give me an example
of abnormal aggression

09:34.174 --> 09:35.108
within the game?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.509
I'm not sure.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.479
Uh, players who would attack
for sport rather than points.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.081
Griefers.
Or somebody who stays up

09:41.148 --> 09:43.383
for days straight playing
is called a camper.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.385
Listen, if I could get access

09:45.452 --> 09:47.254
to Primacy's server,
well, then, I can

09:47.320 --> 09:49.056
analyze patterns
and identify players

09:49.122 --> 09:52.926
who are most likely to cross
from virtual to actual killings.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.829
I'll get us a warrant
for the server.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.765
Yeah, hey, what do you think
these are?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.099
Signature trinkets.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.770
A record of the people
who've been up here.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.005
DON: Your fingerprints are all
over this.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.174
So you were up
on that roof before.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.275
Why did you lie?

10:08.341 --> 10:09.843
You're the man.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.945
I was quaking in my boots,
I'm ashamed to say.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.580
What happened?
You met Weyburn,

10:13.647 --> 10:15.816
and you got in an argument,
things got physical, is that it?

10:15.883 --> 10:17.651
And then he, what,
he fell off the roof?

10:17.718 --> 10:18.919
No.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.988
I never met Peter in person.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.091
Yesterday was going to be
the first time.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.859
I, um, I only knew him online

10:25.926 --> 10:28.028
as our alliance
leader, Tycon-Z.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.296
And when were you up there?

10:29.362 --> 10:30.964
Yesterday.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.067
Um, I was gathering recon data
in case I could aid

10:34.134 --> 10:37.637
Tycon-Z in his first foray
into the LA epicenter.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.072
Where were you this morning?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.340
At my job.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.242
Um, Paco's Tacos on Pico.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.078
Yeah? Who set up
the meet, you or Weyburn?

10:45.145 --> 10:48.015
Well, it wasn't
actually set up.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.283
He... he told me
to stay away,

10:50.350 --> 10:51.885
but I had to see him.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.021
Tycon-Z is awesome.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.056
And what do you mean
he told you to stay away?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.859
We suspected Shadowhound Brigade
of cheating.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.093
He went there
to confront them.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.561
- Who? The what?
- Shadowhound Brigade.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.897
They're vicious, immoral dogs,

11:03.964 --> 11:07.167
capable of entrapping
and destroying noble warriors

11:07.234 --> 11:09.169
using devious
and unfair methods.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.239
You understand we're talking
about a real person here, okay?

11:12.305 --> 11:13.440
Who's really dead.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.079
I know.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.248
The game is my coping mechanism.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.784
MEGAN:
We think your company's game

11:23.851 --> 11:24.918
is involved in Weyburn's death.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.219
We're in the last 72 hours

11:26.286 --> 11:27.988
before somebody wins
a million dollars,

11:28.055 --> 11:30.157
and we can't afford
bad publicity.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.393
So, are you sure this Weyburn
dude didn't just

11:33.460 --> 11:35.863
slip and fall off the roof?
That'd be far preferable.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.832
- Uh, Mr. Moore...
- Binky.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.734
Your name is "Binky"?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.235
Like the pacifier.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.503
Right, Binky.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.838
Uh, the "Weyburn dude" works

11:44.905 --> 11:46.306
for the Department
of Justice, so we're going

11:46.373 --> 11:48.008
to have to investigate
his death whether it's

11:48.075 --> 11:50.077
convenient for you or not.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.578
Got it.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.914
How many players
on Primacy?

11:53.981 --> 11:56.984
Worldwide, five
and a half million.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.186
Uh, at any given moment,

11:59.252 --> 12:02.222
we might have a couple
hundred thousand players

12:02.289 --> 12:05.425
logged in
for the Primacy MMORPG,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.394
the online part of the game.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.830
And most of them
don't know about the ARG,

12:09.897 --> 12:11.431
the alternate reality
aspect of Primacy,

12:11.498 --> 12:13.000
which essentially works
like a scavenger hunt

12:13.066 --> 12:14.768
in the real world,
for a money prize.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.870
We've got 5,000
or 6,000 players

12:16.937 --> 12:18.138
competing in that,
mostly local.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.041
Okay, I'm going to need
access to your server.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.943
My information's protected

12:23.010 --> 12:24.845
by privacy laws,
trade secrets...

12:24.912 --> 12:26.279
Search warrant.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.848
I'd like to start
with the IDs

12:27.915 --> 12:30.450
for Weyburn group as well

12:30.517 --> 12:32.052
as the Shadowhound
Brigade, and I'm going

12:32.119 --> 12:33.586
to need names
to go with these.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.188
COLBY:
So is this trinket

12:35.255 --> 12:37.157
your signature
in the Primacy game?

12:39.026 --> 12:39.893
And when were
you on the roof?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.295
Yesterday afternoon,

12:42.362 --> 12:44.597
before my grandkids
got off school.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.233
Did you know Peter Weyburn?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.968
(changing voices):
Never heard of him.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.437
Can you verify your
whereabouts this morning?

12:50.503 --> 12:52.405
I was at work till noon.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.841
Ask my supervisor.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.208
Is the game still on?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.410
Me and my partner really
need this million bucks.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.447
WOMAN:
The money is incidental.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.082
I get satisfaction

13:02.149 --> 13:05.318
from reading signs invisible
to the rest of society.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.821
And where were you this morning
between 8:00 and 10:00?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.422
I'm in my office
by 6:00 a.m.

13:09.489 --> 13:13.493
every day for the opening
of the east coast market.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.266
So, the alibis check out.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.001
Yeah, I don't think
the killer left

13:21.068 --> 13:22.970
his signature trinket
up on the rooftop.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.838
What about the
Weyburn alliance?

13:24.905 --> 13:26.339
All good, including
the Braxton kid.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.010
So Megan's trying to ID
the Shadowhound Brigade now.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.679
Hey, so what's
going on with Liz?

13:32.745 --> 13:34.347
Ah, I don't know.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.515
You know how it is.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.549
Not really, man.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.986
I haven't had a serious
date in, like, two years.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.454
What, two years?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.755
LA's tough, man,

13:42.822 --> 13:45.492
even when you're not working
undercover with the Chinese.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.594
Hey.
Pharaoh861,

13:47.660 --> 13:51.031
one of the ten members
of the Shadowhound Brigade.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.732
Colby, will you call
that number?

13:52.799 --> 13:54.334
- Yep.
- What about the others?

13:54.401 --> 13:55.668
I've tried three of them so far

13:55.735 --> 13:57.770
and none of them have pictures
on the profile page,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.640
which is unusual, and none of
them are answering their phones.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.342
See if anybody answers here.

14:04.077 --> 14:07.714
It's such a shame
about my own office.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.349
I can kind of understand that.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.551
Yeah, I sense a big,
hairy "but" coming.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.120
Ooh, pardon my terrible pun.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.355
What do you want to do
with your life, Larry?

14:15.422 --> 14:17.457
Seriously,
you want to take the same

14:17.524 --> 14:19.692
three-hour walks
across the same gardens?

14:19.759 --> 14:21.929
- Hey, don't look askance.
AMITA: Admit it, Larry.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.564
I mean, you're more interested
in the world than that.

14:24.631 --> 14:29.069
Well, I have received
a rather tantalizing offer

14:29.136 --> 14:32.205
to join the DZero team
searching for the Higgs boson.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.873
Well, all right,
the God particle.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.977
Which would be a continuation
of your spiritual seeking

14:37.044 --> 14:39.279
as well as your quest
for unified theory.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.281
Well, faith in science
is still faith, is it not?

14:41.348 --> 14:42.582
Now, that's very cool, Larry.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.318
I think you should
continue with your search

14:45.385 --> 14:47.020
for supersymmetric
particles.

14:47.087 --> 14:51.124
Imagine smashing protons
at 99.99% of the speed of light

14:51.191 --> 14:53.560
all to locate a single

14:53.626 --> 14:56.263
fragment which would
move us one step

14:56.329 --> 14:58.031
closer to unifying
all physics,

14:58.098 --> 15:02.202
explaining how the Old One
created the universe.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.704
(sighs):
What could be more spiritual?

15:04.771 --> 15:07.074
Not a trivial activity.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.142
No, and neither
is conscious walking, Charles.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.510
AMITA:
Okay, the normal

15:10.577 --> 15:12.512
behavioral parameters
for the game are set.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.414
All right, great,
let's run this program,

15:14.481 --> 15:16.616
see if we can't locate
any players

15:16.683 --> 15:18.151
that are acting abnormally.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.886
Okay, I'll be back
after my seminar.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.454
Bye-bye.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.922
Bye, Larry.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.696
Okay, how is it she knows
so much about this game?

15:29.762 --> 15:30.998
She's been playing Primacy

15:31.064 --> 15:33.233
with an online group
of people for years.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.067
Really?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.903
Did you know this?
Uh-uh.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.106
(groans)

15:39.172 --> 15:41.108
What was that sound?
What is that?

15:41.174 --> 15:42.976
I wonder if she might be
in the midst

15:43.043 --> 15:45.979
of one of those online
friendships,

15:46.046 --> 15:49.816
unconsummated,
but emotionally intimate.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.252
(phone ringing)

15:52.319 --> 15:53.987
(groans)

15:54.054 --> 15:55.122
Hello, Ruby.

15:55.188 --> 15:59.126
(clears throat): I've said that
I would prefer not to.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.293
Okay, okay, ten minutes,

16:00.360 --> 16:03.196
but this has got to be
the only one, right?

16:03.263 --> 16:04.531
Thank you.
(cell phone slams shut)

16:04.597 --> 16:05.698
Morning TV interview.

16:05.765 --> 16:09.202
I have the willpower
of a field mouse.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.205
But within that field,
you're a very popular mouse.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.906
No answer there, either.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.210
All right, well,
let's go to Bulldog472.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.246
(computer chimes)
- Max Barnes.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.182
347 Trilson Street
in Culver City.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.117
And there's no photo
of him, either.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.485
Okay, I got him right here.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.655
Max Barnes, age 93,
deceased November, '06.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.357
Well, that's six
fake screen names

16:30.423 --> 16:32.225
for the Shadowhound Brigade.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.693
Yeah, this alliance
doesn't really exist.

16:49.242 --> 16:52.011
Hey, this was posted
to the Primacy Web site

16:52.079 --> 16:53.546
three hours ago.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.748
Wolftrax says it was hacked in,
uploaded from an outside server.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.451
The Primacy bloggers think
it's some kind of a hoax.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.253
That it has an embedded clue
for the ARG endgame.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.122
CHARLIE:
Does it?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.723
Not according to Binky Moore.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.658
Binky? You know what?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.627
I'm going to let my algorithm
search the server history

17:07.694 --> 17:09.862
for embedded clues and patterns
and we'll see what shows up.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.731
Where's my brother?

17:11.798 --> 17:14.701
He had a lunch meeting.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.171
I don't know.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.806
I mean...

17:19.872 --> 17:20.873
It's not really Liz.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.210
I mean, look,
she's a great girl, right?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.578
You know, it's just...

17:25.645 --> 17:27.314
it's the whole thing
of keeping work

17:27.380 --> 17:31.584
and-and our relationship
separate, I think.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.653
You know, your mother and I met
while working together.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.789
It's a little different
in my case, don't you think?

17:36.856 --> 17:39.426
Well, people always fall
for each other at work.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.294
It's where you spend
most of your time.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.697
If your heart's not
in it, you can't stay.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.033
That wouldn't be fair
to either one of you.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.302
And if you feel like
ending it, then I doubt

17:49.369 --> 17:51.838
it's because of the job.
(phone rings)

17:51.904 --> 17:54.207
Eppes.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.876
Uh-huh, all right.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.146
You know what, Dad, I've got
to take this, okay, so, um...

17:59.212 --> 18:00.847
I'll talk to you later.
Thanks for lunch.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.117
Donnie, she works with you.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.319
You have to straighten it out.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.490
I know.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.295
Primacy, the ARG,

18:15.362 --> 18:17.230
has been underway
for a month.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.865
The vertical lines

18:18.931 --> 18:20.467
behind me represent alliances.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.403
The horizontal lines
are the alliances' attacks.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.772
Two weeks ago,
there were seven alliances

18:25.838 --> 18:27.774
running neck-in-neck
for the million-dollar prize.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.910
And until that point, Primacy
operated like any good game,

18:30.977 --> 18:35.348
with leaders surging
and ebbing in expected patterns.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.617
Ten days ago,
a whole different story emerges.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.619
Anytime an alliance
holds the lead

18:39.686 --> 18:42.822
for more than 36 hours,
it suddenly drops out,

18:42.889 --> 18:44.457
never recovering.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.958
So someone forced them to quit.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.894
Well, the players don't know
who's in the lead, so either

18:47.960 --> 18:50.730
it's someone inside the company
or a high-end hacker.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.333
Four of the seven
front-runners are out.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.702
Weyburn's group dropped away
with his death,

18:55.768 --> 18:58.205
leaving two alliances:
the Readymades

18:58.271 --> 19:00.707
and the Shadowhound Brigade

19:00.773 --> 19:02.409
as potential winners
of this thing.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.111
And potential suspects.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.780
This Shadowhound
is the phony alliance.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.516
MEGAN:
Six out of ten are deceased.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.451
We have four more
to account for.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.819
And they can't
all be fake.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.887
I mean... someone's
playing these avatars.

19:14.954 --> 19:15.688
COLBY:
Yeah, and someone would

19:15.755 --> 19:17.290
have to show up
to claim the prize money.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.558
AMITA:
I can play the game,

19:18.625 --> 19:21.194
you know, and try
to interact with the avatars.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.363
Yeah, you know,
and if she gets a hit,

19:23.430 --> 19:24.897
I'll track
the Internet providers

19:24.964 --> 19:26.098
for a location.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.400
- Great.
- How hard would it be

19:27.467 --> 19:29.836
for someone who works
for Primacy to set this all up?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.604
Well, there are
powerful firewalls

19:31.671 --> 19:33.473
to prevent inside cheating.

19:33.540 --> 19:38.478
Unless... unless it's
the creator himself.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.112
DON: Where were you yesterday
morning, Mr. Moore?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.281
Networking breakfast
at the Biltmore.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.815
About 300 witnesses.

19:42.882 --> 19:47.987
You sold Wolftrax to Kuma Games
18 months ago, right?

19:48.054 --> 19:50.590
I built Wolftrax
up from freeware

19:50.657 --> 19:52.225
to a sale for a nice
chunk of change.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.760
Now, I'm president
in name only.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.027
Why didn't you just walk away?

19:55.094 --> 19:56.796
I'm not interested in money.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.299
- Really?
- We're creating the future.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.600
And people are sleepwalking.

20:00.667 --> 20:01.934
But it is the new literacy.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.970
Knowledge isn't
in books anymore.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.006
It's in electronic media
and Joe Blow in Idaho

20:07.073 --> 20:08.241
doesn't know how to access it.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.742
But when he plays an ARG,

20:09.809 --> 20:11.344
we're teaching him
the Dewey decimal system

20:11.411 --> 20:12.579
of the Digital Age.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.814
Yes, and advancing
our business.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.317
Which is why I put up
the million-dollar prize myself,

20:17.384 --> 20:19.586
to motivate people.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.521
Well, you certainly
did that, huh?

20:21.588 --> 20:24.591
I knew we had a rogue alliance.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.025
Groups in the lead
were getting intimidated.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.695
Physically?
No.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.264
Spamming, jamming, online
raids-- we had complaints.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.799
I fully thought the game
would self-regulate.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.534
I can't believe this
is happening to my game.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.203
Oh, my God, that's Binky Moore!

20:37.270 --> 20:38.305
(banging on window)

20:38.371 --> 20:39.939
- You are a god!
- Slave-boy, let's go.

20:40.006 --> 20:40.907
Can I get his autograph?

20:40.973 --> 20:42.942
You're going to have
to adore him from afar.

20:44.043 --> 20:47.947
The nerds love me.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.015
I can't get
anyone

20:49.081 --> 20:51.484
from the Shadowhound
Brigade to play me.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.421
Kali, Goddess of Destruction?

20:54.487 --> 20:56.356
I picked it when I was 19, okay?

20:56.423 --> 20:59.359
She's remarkably... hot.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.094
Well, sexy avatars
get treated nicer.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.331
Okay, this guy's not online.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.332
Who's next?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.667
Uh, let's see.

21:07.734 --> 21:11.137
We've got... Spectre.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.739
Spectre.
(phone ringing)

21:15.074 --> 21:16.676
No.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.010
My publicist wants
me to show up

21:18.077 --> 21:19.646
early for that TV interview

21:19.712 --> 21:21.514
so they can put makeup
all over my face.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.050
I think you'd look cute
with eyeliner.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.352
Yeah? Thanks.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.620
Hey, so you going
to move in or not?

21:28.388 --> 21:29.155
Spectre's online.

21:29.221 --> 21:32.859
He's battling for control
of a transport station.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.929
Let's see if we can get
a track on the IP and...

21:36.996 --> 21:38.197
get a real-world location.

21:38.264 --> 21:43.403
Finally, a real, live member
of the Shadowhound Brigade.

21:46.739 --> 21:50.577
Spectre?

21:50.643 --> 21:53.346
All right, I got him.

21:53.413 --> 21:57.917
Yeah, Frank... Riegert.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.320
All right, you keep him playing.

22:01.388 --> 22:02.822
We're on our way.

22:02.889 --> 22:03.690
(pounding on door)

22:03.756 --> 22:06.292
MEGAN:
Frank Riegert, FBI, open up!

22:06.359 --> 22:08.795
COLBY:
Let's go, Frank, open the door.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.797
(door bursts open)

22:14.066 --> 22:15.001
Clear.

22:16.102 --> 22:20.006
Oh, damn.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.741
Megan, he's dead.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.944
Smells like he
was electrocuted.

22:26.979 --> 22:27.780
Clear.

22:27.847 --> 22:31.684
(fighting sounds on-screen)

22:31.751 --> 22:33.686
Colby?

22:33.753 --> 22:36.355
Yeah.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.790
It's operating itself.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.128
(grunting, blows landing)

22:45.131 --> 22:47.299
Frank Riegert's dead.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.300
What?
His computer

22:48.367 --> 22:49.536
is running the game
without him.

22:49.602 --> 22:50.537
(chuckling):
A zombie?

22:50.603 --> 22:51.671
No, then Riegert's
not Spectre.

22:51.738 --> 22:52.905
I mean, whoever
the real Spectre is

22:52.972 --> 22:54.541
is controlling his computer
from somewhere else.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.542
Are you tracing

22:55.608 --> 22:56.776
his Internet location?

22:56.843 --> 22:59.045
He's using dynamic
IPs; he's routing

22:59.111 --> 23:00.179
through dozens of servers.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.715
You know, it's sort
of like, um, like...

23:02.782 --> 23:04.584
changing stolen cars
every few blocks.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.318
You know, when a car thief
is in a hur...

23:06.385 --> 23:07.654
I got it, I got it.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.688
I stole his mojo bag.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.322
Hold on,
I have to get out of here.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.658
Uh...

23:11.724 --> 23:14.126
she stole his mojo.

23:14.193 --> 23:14.961
Okay.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.897
Now I get to see
what he's hiding.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.899
(tapping keys)

23:21.868 --> 23:23.536
Is that GPS?

23:23.603 --> 23:25.638
Yeah, 0600-- 6:00 a.m.

23:25.705 --> 23:28.575
Hey, Megan, we've
got a game clue

23:28.641 --> 23:31.844
for another location.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.312
(beeping)

23:33.379 --> 23:34.313
Northgate Dam.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.948
All right, we'll check it out.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.850
You'll need us to figure out
clues at the location.

23:37.917 --> 23:38.985
We can call you.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.019
You couldn't decode
the roof clues.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.454
You could be
at the site for hours

23:41.521 --> 23:43.456
and not see anything.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.991
Point taken.

23:58.237 --> 24:01.307
COLBY: Guys, do me a favor
and stay behind me.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.308
Yeah, stay behind him.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.676
So, listen,
with that GPS

24:03.743 --> 24:05.444
you got there,
you've got 15 feet

24:05.512 --> 24:08.114
of uncertainty
at every location.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.483
All right, Amita,
you see anything

24:10.550 --> 24:11.751
with that X-ray
vision of yours?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.786
No, but with my naked eye

24:13.853 --> 24:15.755
I see a misaligned arrow,
which is a classic ARG clue.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.356
It's 6:00 now.

24:17.423 --> 24:18.991
CHARLIE:
What about those rocks?

24:19.058 --> 24:20.126
You know,

24:20.192 --> 24:21.761
the way they're arranged--
couldn't that be a clue?

24:21.828 --> 24:23.229
AMITA:
Oh, yeah.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.297
Oh, there's something down here.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.499
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.034
What?
Hold on, yeah.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.071
What are you doing?

24:32.138 --> 24:33.506
Look, Charlie, there's
something else down here.

24:33.573 --> 24:36.008
- Well, be careful, okay?
- Okay.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.044
It's a symbol.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.548
Yeah, this is definitely
part of the game.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.517
(alarm buzzing)

24:44.584 --> 24:45.718
What is that?

24:45.785 --> 24:47.620
Go back up the ladder!

24:47.687 --> 24:49.589
Back! Get
up quick!

24:50.489 --> 24:51.958
Move, move, move, move!

24:53.593 --> 24:54.894
Colby!

24:56.996 --> 24:59.498
Colby!

25:06.906 --> 25:09.041
- Call Don!
- Oh, God, oh, God!

25:11.077 --> 25:11.811
(dialing)

25:11.878 --> 25:13.813
- Colby!
- We need help.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.147
Colby's been swept away

25:15.214 --> 25:16.983
at the Northgate Dam.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.563
Grab my hand,
Colby, come on!

25:30.630 --> 25:32.064
Charlie,
be careful!

25:32.131 --> 25:33.065
Hang on!

25:33.132 --> 25:35.001
(grunts)

25:35.067 --> 25:35.802
Come on!

25:35.868 --> 25:37.570
- Charlie...
- Hold on!

25:37.637 --> 25:39.471
Come on! Reach!

25:39.538 --> 25:40.673
Come on,
just reach!

25:40.740 --> 25:42.241
I got you!

25:42.308 --> 25:43.943
(grunting)

25:44.010 --> 25:46.245
Just reach!
(grunting)

25:46.312 --> 25:47.947
Come on.
Come on, man.

25:48.014 --> 25:48.981
Come on.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.116
Come on, man.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.117
(grunts)

25:51.183 --> 25:51.851
You all right?

25:51.918 --> 25:53.552
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.754
Geez.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.624
CHARLIE: We got to get you to a
hospital.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.859
No, I'm okay.

25:59.926 --> 26:03.062
Spectre tried to kill us.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.063
Yeah.

26:04.130 --> 26:07.166
Yeah, he did.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.970
What's up with you
and the water?

26:11.037 --> 26:11.971
- Hey.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.572
Thanks for asking, Megan.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.241
- It was a setup.
- Yeah, definitely.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.844
I mean, that dam releases
overflow every morning.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.045
How are you doing?

26:19.111 --> 26:20.046
You really okay?

26:20.112 --> 26:21.380
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.315
So Spectre set up a false clue.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.151
Yeah, I mean, whoever
gets ahead of him

26:25.217 --> 26:27.153
gets intimidated
or they get killed.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.388
Now, did Spectre kill Riegert,
do we know?

26:29.455 --> 26:30.757
We got e-mails
on his computer.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.158
They were accomplices.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.960
They were definitely trying
to steal the million bucks,

26:34.026 --> 26:35.795
but after Weyburn
was murdered...

26:35.862 --> 26:37.463
Riegert got cold feet.

26:37.529 --> 26:38.665
Yeah, Riegert
wanted the money.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.299
It was Spectre that
had other plans.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.969
He was intending to open
some kind of a new game

26:43.035 --> 26:45.638
called Chain Factor
with his prize money.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.473
All right,
so Spectre and Riegert

26:47.539 --> 26:50.609
were the only two real people
in the Shadowhound Brigade.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.278
And now it's just
Spectre, right?

26:52.344 --> 26:55.347
Yeah, who kills people by faking
accidents, and I don't think

26:55.414 --> 26:57.383
this is a guy with
a previous criminal record.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.450
I think
this is his first foray.

26:58.517 --> 27:03.489
I-I just think he's a fanatic in
the midst of a manic obsession.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.892
If that's the case,
it's only going to intensify

27:05.958 --> 27:07.593
as he gets closer
to the prize.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.996
All right, well, then,
we got to shut down the game.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.398
Yeah, we do that, he's
got no reason to show up.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.600
Yeah but if we leave it going,
he's going to mow down anyone

27:14.667 --> 27:16.002
that gets in his way.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.436
Hey, I know how
to trap this guy.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.472
Yeah? Does it involve your
deceptive upper body strength?

27:20.539 --> 27:22.274
That was pure adrenaline.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.678
Listen, to win, Spectre has
to play the game, right?

27:25.745 --> 27:27.780
We control the game,
we control Spectre.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.148
We hack the hacker.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.183
Shut it down and somehow
make him think it's still on?

27:31.250 --> 27:32.819
No, we don't have
to shut it down.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.153
Look, it's like a train yard.

27:34.220 --> 27:38.124
Every player in this game is
a train coming into our station

27:38.190 --> 27:39.558
and we send them all through,

27:39.625 --> 27:42.494
but when we see Spectre's train
approaching, we sidetrack him

27:42.561 --> 27:44.630
without affecting
the rest of the players.

27:44.697 --> 27:45.865
How do we trick him

27:45.932 --> 27:48.367
into thinking
he's playing the real game?

27:48.434 --> 27:49.201
A mirror site.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.070
Okay, it's like one
of those fake bank pages

27:51.137 --> 27:53.405
that scammers put up
to steal personal data.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.141
Look,

27:55.207 --> 27:56.242
I'm gonna call
the game company,

27:56.308 --> 27:57.476
I'm gonna get them
to work with me on this,

27:57.543 --> 27:59.345
and we're going to set
up the mirror site here.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.247
All right, that sounds good,
go for it.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.983
And you know...
Amita can play him online,

28:04.050 --> 28:06.919
but, uh,
no more fieldwork for her.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.888
COLBY:
Where do you want them?

28:08.955 --> 28:11.257
End of the daisy chain.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.091
Translation?

28:12.158 --> 28:13.425
That would be
right there.

28:13.492 --> 28:14.660
All right,
you guys,

28:14.727 --> 28:16.095
so just hit a bunch
of random keys,

28:16.162 --> 28:17.529
all right, that'll make
the site look alive.

28:17.596 --> 28:18.798
It'll make it look

28:18.865 --> 28:21.067
like hundreds of people
are accessing it, okay?

28:21.133 --> 28:23.736
As we lead Spectre to the
final clue for the Primal Key,

28:23.803 --> 28:24.871
fewer people would be around.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.505
Yeah, we can't let him win
too easily.

28:26.572 --> 28:27.539
BRAXTON: Don't worry about that.

28:27.606 --> 28:30.276
I'm going to get a few shots
into this guy myself.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.244
And then we're going
to let him win.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.847
Yeah, we will be
the swarming multitudes.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.648
You are to fight Spectre
and then...

28:36.715 --> 28:39.151
He wins the final clue,
taking him

28:39.218 --> 28:41.353
to MacArthur Park
for the Primal Key.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.254
And then we arrest him.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.790
Okay, so everybody's ready,
right?

28:43.856 --> 28:46.025
Here we go.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.505
Come on...

28:59.571 --> 29:01.173
Where is this guy?

29:01.240 --> 29:02.708
Spectre won't
attack until we take

29:02.775 --> 29:04.076
the lead.

29:12.684 --> 29:14.420
Braxton, grab that ax,

29:14.486 --> 29:15.922
chop down that wall; there's
something behind it.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.623
All right, on it.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.158
(ax clanging)

29:22.028 --> 29:25.097
Good eye,
oh, Captain, my Captain.

29:25.164 --> 29:28.500
Okay, he doesn't
want me in here.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.170
MEGAN:
That's him, that's Spectre.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.905
That's an ugly avatar.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.974
Oh, he's talking to me,

29:35.041 --> 29:37.243
in-game chat.
I can voice it.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.611
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Kali, surprised to see you.

29:39.678 --> 29:41.413
Were you unable

29:41.480 --> 29:44.616
to decipher the clue
you stole from me?

29:44.683 --> 29:47.486
I'm working on it.

29:47.553 --> 29:50.356
I want my mojo back.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.659
Come... and get it.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.495
Can you trace
in-game chat?

29:56.562 --> 29:57.563
(grunting on-screen)

29:57.629 --> 29:59.565
(weapons clanging)

30:07.306 --> 30:09.675
All right, just let him kill you
so he can get the clue

30:09.741 --> 30:11.243
and head over to the park.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.312
BRAXTON: No, the fight's
got to look real.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.380
AMITA: Heal me.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.447
Heal me, I need my arm.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.483
I'm healing you
as fast as I can.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.120
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Kali, you are finished.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.388
MEGAN:
Let him win.

30:22.454 --> 30:23.856
Easy now.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.591
(weapons clanging)

30:25.657 --> 30:29.461
BRAXTON:
He's behind you!

30:29.528 --> 30:30.096
(grunts)

30:30.897 --> 30:32.464
Whoo!

30:33.565 --> 30:34.566
You killed him.
Oh, my God.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.939
Damn it, Amita!

30:40.006 --> 30:41.373
I'm so sorry.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.174
It was reflexive.

30:42.241 --> 30:43.675
I-I can't believe I did that.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.345
All right, what now?

30:46.412 --> 30:49.515
Well, um, I could IM
him, get him to meet me.

30:49.581 --> 30:50.516
My suggestion:

30:50.582 --> 30:52.318
We do nothing.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.187
Now, losing one battle
is not going to deter him,

30:55.254 --> 30:56.422
not if he's a zealot.

30:56.488 --> 30:57.389
Kali is the focus

30:57.456 --> 31:00.126
of his rage
and the obstacle to his goal.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.793
He'll get in
touch with you.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.029
So what now, we just wait?

31:03.095 --> 31:04.196
Can he even...

31:04.263 --> 31:06.498
talk to you in-game
w-when his avatar's dead?

31:06.565 --> 31:08.134
Yeah, I mean,
that's the only way

31:08.200 --> 31:10.302
he can talk to Kali
is in-game chat.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.637
(phone ringing)

31:11.703 --> 31:14.240
I'm sorry, that's me.

31:14.306 --> 31:18.444
Aah... I have to go do that
ridiculous TV interview.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.080
All right, so what's the plan
if Spectre makes contact?

31:21.147 --> 31:22.314
We set up
a meeting.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.449
No.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.517
No more meeting her in
the real world, please.

31:25.584 --> 31:26.518
AMITA:
No.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.254
No, no, not me-- Kali.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.622
Yeah, he doesn't know
what she looks like in person.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.690
It could be me.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.159
Right, I mean,
it could be me.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.263
Well, I'm just saying, it could.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.331
I'd be honored if you'd consider
joining our alliance,

31:39.398 --> 31:42.468
or at the very least,
giving me your e-mail address.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.470
Anthony,
you've been really helpful.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.538
I'll be back
as soon as possible.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.807
Okay, I'm going
to get you a ride home.

31:48.874 --> 31:50.842
Bye, Anthony, thanks.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.979
Bye, Charlie,
have fun.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.014
I'll be watching.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.782
You didn't have
to do this.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.650
I-I really
appreciate it.

31:58.717 --> 31:59.551
Charlie, this is
a treat for me.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.153
Besides I can't help it,
I'm proud of you.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.621
Well, you know, getting
up all early and all.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.223
It's just, you're always
there for me and Don.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.857
I should buy one
of those plastic

32:05.924 --> 32:08.060
"World's Best Dad" statues.

32:08.127 --> 32:09.361
(chuckles)
You're buttering me up.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.564
Well, I'd like to broach
a certain topic.

32:12.631 --> 32:13.499
Go ahead.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.567
I would like Amita
to move in with us.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.369
You getting married?

32:17.436 --> 32:19.205
(laughs)
Nah, I'm just kidding.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.439
I'm just kidding.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.208
I know how things go
these days.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.176
Yeah, sure,
she should move in.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.212
Besides I've been thinking
about those condos.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.047
Really, I mean,
it's a good time to buy.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.581
The prices are coming
down.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.217
Yeah, but you wouldn't
have to move out.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.618
Not yet.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.420
Well, what does Amita say?

32:34.486 --> 32:36.188
We're in
discussions.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.856
Oh, that's, uh,
that's good.

32:37.923 --> 32:39.858
Uh, that's great.

32:39.925 --> 32:42.928
What if he doesn't make contact?

32:42.995 --> 32:45.331
Well, should Kali send
him a message?

32:45.397 --> 32:47.599
Oh, he expected
to win,

32:47.666 --> 32:49.968
now he has to
rethink his plan.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.470
He's got no
other play

32:51.537 --> 32:52.704
but to be in touch
with Kali.

32:52.771 --> 32:56.442
Well, we've got no other play
here if he's not.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.244
(phone ringing)

32:58.310 --> 32:59.578
Oh, it's me.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.612
Must be Charlie.

33:00.679 --> 33:01.947
Hello?

33:02.014 --> 33:03.782
MAN:
I want the key.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.784
Spectre.

33:05.851 --> 33:08.420
How did you get my phone number?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.022
I know who you are... Amita.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.124
I need a trace
on a cell phone.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.292
Why should I talk to you?

33:13.359 --> 33:15.494
I mean, I know where
the Primal Key is.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.595
I have a proposal.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.131
Believe me,
you'll come out better.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.334
Maybe, maybe not.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.570
Regardless, I'm not talking
about this on the phone.

33:24.636 --> 33:25.637
You at your computer?

33:25.704 --> 33:27.439
Why?

33:27.506 --> 33:30.642
Triple click on your avatar.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.518
H-How did you do that?

33:40.619 --> 33:43.055
I want the key.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.857
Okay, um...

33:45.924 --> 33:50.062
Meet me at MacArthur Park
at... at 7:00 a.m.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.598
What-what do you look like?

33:52.664 --> 33:54.066
(line disconnects)

34:02.974 --> 34:04.042
He knows everything about me.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.211
Well, not everything.
He seems to think

34:05.277 --> 34:06.445
you're a regular player.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.380
What if he's just
setting me up?

34:08.447 --> 34:09.515
Amita, we can pull this off
without you.

34:09.581 --> 34:10.749
What if you
don't get him?

34:10.816 --> 34:12.017
He knows my address,

34:12.084 --> 34:13.652
he knows
my social security number.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.388
I mean, I think Spectre
will only show if I go.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.424
We'd have undercover agents,
and snipers,

34:18.490 --> 34:21.560
and you'd wear a two-way
earpiece so we could talk.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.029
What if he knows I'm working
with you, and he just...

34:24.096 --> 34:25.831
You'd have a bulletproof vest.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.266
LARRY:
A bulletproof v...

34:27.333 --> 34:28.600
You know, I really think

34:28.667 --> 34:30.636
we should consider
the alternatives here.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.272
With the sting, we made her
Spectre's only rival.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.606
She's our
best chance, Larry.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.675
But is she not allowed
to decline?

34:38.777 --> 34:40.846
I'll do it.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.253
I think we need
to talk to Charles.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.554
No. Let him finish his interview
in peace.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.955
And this whole thing
will be over

34:50.021 --> 34:51.022
before he even hears about it.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.193
With us this morning

34:54.260 --> 34:56.162
is Dr. Charles Eppes
from CalSci.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.964
He's written the first math book
you're gonna want to read,

34:59.030 --> 35:01.533
The Attraction Equation.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.403
Can you tell us how to find
a mate using math, Dr. Eppes?

35:04.470 --> 35:05.871
Oh, well,
you can call me Charlie.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.373
You don't have to...

35:09.275 --> 35:11.510
Oh, I've developed
a new kind of math.

35:11.577 --> 35:15.647
It's, um, sort of a calculus
of human relationships.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.883
It's based in decision theory.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.685
And it can help...

35:19.751 --> 35:23.889
it can help people choose
a better partner

35:23.955 --> 35:24.890
by mathematically predicting

35:24.956 --> 35:27.593
which couplings have
the best chance at success.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.895
Can you tell me why I keep
picking the wrong guy?

35:29.961 --> 35:31.797
Oh, uh... well,

35:31.863 --> 35:34.466
you might need to, uh,
put a little logic

35:34.533 --> 35:36.235
into your romantic
equations, I guess.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.604
Oh, maybe you can
help me with that.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.239
Are you spoken
for, Charlie?

35:40.306 --> 35:41.340
I am. I am.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.674
I'm dating
a very beautiful woman.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.543
And I hope she's watching
right now.

35:44.610 --> 35:48.347
Because she really is an
incredible inspiration to me.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.254
Okay, Amita,
there's a lamppost,

35:55.321 --> 35:57.256
if you can see,
right up ahead on your right.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.690
I want you to just

35:58.757 --> 36:00.692
casually stop there.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.762
Don't look at the cameras.

36:03.829 --> 36:04.730
Megan?

36:04.796 --> 36:06.765
Clear in all directions.

36:06.832 --> 36:07.799
Colby?

36:07.866 --> 36:09.835
Nothing

36:09.901 --> 36:11.237
suspicious, Don.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.271
(phone ringing)

36:12.338 --> 36:13.705
Okay, go ahead
and answer the phone.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.708
We got you
on your Bluetooth.

36:16.775 --> 36:17.643
Get a trace going.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.345
(on radio):
Take it easy. Just answer it.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.248
SPECTRE (on phone):
Go through the tunnel.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.250
No, meet me by the water.

36:24.316 --> 36:27.085
Feisty, and as pretty
as your pictures.

36:27.152 --> 36:28.754
I like the way
those jeans fit you.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.292
Okay, great,

36:33.359 --> 36:34.593
so you can see me.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.628
And I see you're not moving.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.097
Okay, who's got a visual?
Anyone got a visual for me?

36:39.164 --> 36:40.366
Negative.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.567
All right, north side
of the park, guys.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.435
DON:
Everyone take it easy.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.337
Amita, I want you
to turn around.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.539
And just... just head right
into that tunnel.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.710
(applause)

36:51.777 --> 36:53.245
Hey.
Hey.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.580
Thanks for coming down, man.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.482
All right, that went
pretty well, I thought.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.983
- Yeah, Charlie...
- I screwed up a little bit,

36:58.049 --> 36:59.518
- Charlie...
- but she-she was very nice.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.086
- we-we need to talk to you.
- What's up?

37:01.152 --> 37:02.554
It's about Amita.

37:02.621 --> 37:03.989
Is she all right?
What's going on?

37:04.055 --> 37:06.258
She's, um, she's fine,
she's with Don. Um...

37:06.325 --> 37:08.093
Look, she's gone to meet
Spectre.

37:08.159 --> 37:09.761
Where is she right now?

37:09.828 --> 37:11.062
We can't interfere,
it would be too dangerous.

37:11.129 --> 37:12.564
Where is she right now, Larry?

37:22.107 --> 37:25.311
SPECTRE: I have a proposal that
will change your life.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.112
Let's hear it.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.315
I need a partner to realize
a vision unparalleled

37:29.381 --> 37:32.384
in contemporary gaming.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.119
A paradigm shift.

37:34.185 --> 37:37.323
Now go toward that building
at the back of the park.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.057
DON:
All right, listen up, everybody.

37:39.124 --> 37:43.662
It's the old Community Center
at the northeast corner.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.964
Primacy, We had a chance with

37:46.031 --> 37:47.699
but binko-assbite cashed in.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.901
You work at Wolftrax Games...

37:49.968 --> 37:50.769
Not anymore.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.639
You're a smart girl;
read the signs from here.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.674
Oh, come on, just talk to me.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.276
Great reward
requires great risk.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.346
Kali faces fear,

38:00.412 --> 38:01.813
how about Amita?

38:01.880 --> 38:02.881
DON:
All right, Amita, don't go

38:02.948 --> 38:04.350
in that building
until I tell you, now.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.584
All right, sweetheart.
Do not go

38:05.651 --> 38:07.085
into that building
until I tell you.

38:07.152 --> 38:09.688
Megan, you're in the front.
Colby, you stay with her.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.723
SPECTRE: Consider an
emergent game economy

38:11.790 --> 38:13.825
built around an abstract
combinatorial system,

38:13.892 --> 38:17.996
played across worldwide media,
embedded virally

38:18.063 --> 38:19.931
into Web sites, TV,

38:19.998 --> 38:21.166
text messages, billboards,

38:21.232 --> 38:24.703
even radio, beyond the control
of corporations...

38:24.770 --> 38:27.172
Yeah, but for what purpose?

38:27.238 --> 38:29.508
Step through the door.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.543
Chain Factor.
What does that mean?

38:31.610 --> 38:32.711
(line disconnects)

38:32.778 --> 38:34.179
What's up with the trace?

38:34.245 --> 38:35.447
(beeping)

38:35.514 --> 38:36.782
He's inside the building.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.283
Guys, he's inside
the building, all right?

38:38.350 --> 38:39.418
He's inside the building.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.819
Colby, you stay with her.

38:40.886 --> 38:41.853
You got it, Don.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.755
Megan?

38:43.822 --> 38:46.291
We're in the building, Don.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.626
DON:
Amita, go ahead.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.294
Don't worry. Don't worry.

38:49.361 --> 38:50.729
Just go ahead in.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.063
Colby, stay right
with her.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.465
All right, I'm going.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.704
(echoing):
Ready to make a deal?

38:58.770 --> 39:01.507
What's Chain Factor?

39:01.573 --> 39:03.542
The game
I'll launch

39:03.609 --> 39:05.210
with the million
dollars.

39:05.276 --> 39:06.344
But I have

39:06.412 --> 39:07.646
the Primal Key
location.

39:07.713 --> 39:10.015
Want to join
my alliance?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.619
I get it.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.488
You're playing
with emergence,

39:16.555 --> 39:18.857
where the game takes
on a life of its own.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.228
Right?

39:23.294 --> 39:24.563
Yeah,

39:24.630 --> 39:27.966
it's all real life
and death now.

39:29.735 --> 39:32.103
(man grunting, Amita screaming)

39:33.439 --> 39:34.372
Freeze!

39:34.440 --> 39:35.373
Let her go!

39:35.441 --> 39:37.242
You gotta let her go.

39:37.308 --> 39:38.410
Let her go!

39:38.477 --> 39:39.845
You cheated!

39:39.911 --> 39:43.882
Get down
on your knees!

39:43.949 --> 39:44.950
Hey!

39:45.016 --> 39:45.817
Oh, God.

39:45.884 --> 39:46.952
You okay?
You all right?

39:47.018 --> 39:48.620
Okay. I got you.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.622
I got you.
I got you.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.023
Let me see.
You okay?

39:52.090 --> 39:52.858
Oh, my God.

39:52.924 --> 39:53.992
Hey! What are
you thinking?

39:54.059 --> 39:55.727
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.
- Huh? How could you...

39:55.794 --> 39:57.429
- I'm sorry.
- It wasn't his fault, okay.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.597
It was my decision.

39:58.664 --> 39:59.931
You all right?

39:59.998 --> 40:00.999
I'm fine.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.301
Come here.

40:03.368 --> 40:06.472
I'm okay.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.840
So Gary Meyers worked
at Wolftrax?

40:08.907 --> 40:10.476
Yeah.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.478
He was fired a
few months ago.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.979
You know, I actually
liked his ideas

40:14.045 --> 40:16.181
about an emergent
game economy.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.516
Are you serious?

40:17.583 --> 40:18.684
His obsession
with control

40:18.750 --> 40:19.718
is the opposite
of emergence.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.787
Emergence requires
allowing natural

40:21.853 --> 40:24.890
and unexpected changes
to... to emerge.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.692
So.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.628
You know, uh, speaking
of emergence.

40:29.695 --> 40:32.464
How are we gonna let
our little economy emerge

40:32.531 --> 40:33.799
to the next phase, Dr. Eppes?

40:33.865 --> 40:34.833
Ah, I've been thinking about
that.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.167
I've been giving it
some thought.

40:36.234 --> 40:38.003
And I thought I could sell
the house back to my Dad,

40:38.069 --> 40:39.938
and we could just
get our own place.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.873
Or, uh, we can get
an apartment,

40:41.940 --> 40:44.275
and you keep the house
as an investment,

40:44.342 --> 40:45.611
and Alan could stay put.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.579
Or option three,
my favorite option,

40:47.646 --> 40:48.780
is my Dad buys the condo,

40:48.847 --> 40:50.415
he's been talking
about forever,

40:50.482 --> 40:52.417
and we live
in the house together.

40:52.484 --> 40:53.885
(sighs)

40:53.952 --> 40:57.556
I mean, we could all three live
in the house together.

40:57.623 --> 40:58.790
Though...

40:58.857 --> 40:59.758
Let's just take the advice

40:59.825 --> 41:01.760
of that popular new author
Charlie Eppes

41:01.827 --> 41:03.194
in his sizzling, scorching hot

41:03.261 --> 41:04.162
new book...

41:04.229 --> 41:06.998
and apply game theory
to our problem.

41:07.065 --> 41:07.866
Hmm.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.868
Think of the
possibilities,

41:09.935 --> 41:12.303
assign values,
then prioritize.

41:12.370 --> 41:14.305
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:14.372 --> 41:15.807
- How's it going?
- Hi.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.475
books to the library.all his

41:17.543 --> 41:19.077
Are you?

41:19.144 --> 41:21.046
Well, that means you've
reentered your office,

41:21.112 --> 41:21.780
I guess.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.181
AMITA:
You know, Larry,

41:23.248 --> 41:24.750
you don't have have
to carry them by hand.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.518
The library will
come pick them up.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.553
Actually, I do.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.420
I'm taking my office apart,

41:29.487 --> 41:30.956
object by object,

41:31.022 --> 41:33.825
releasing all attachments
to my former self.

41:33.892 --> 41:34.960
So you're going
through each

41:35.026 --> 41:36.562
and every book
to say good-bye?

41:36.628 --> 41:37.696
It's true.

41:37.763 --> 41:39.130
ALAN: By the way, Larry,

41:39.197 --> 41:40.699
you do realize that
by emptying your office,

41:40.766 --> 41:41.967
you're simply, uh,

41:42.033 --> 41:43.835
making it possible
to collect more things.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.003
Well, if the
cycle repeats,

41:45.070 --> 41:47.205
perhaps I'll start collecting
with consciousness.

41:47.272 --> 41:48.239
Okay.

41:48.306 --> 41:50.208
Well, I think I see

41:50.275 --> 41:51.577
a condo in
my future.

41:51.643 --> 41:53.178
Not necessarily.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.880
No, we have a plan.

41:54.946 --> 41:57.148
Yeah, that's what
I was afraid of. Hmm.

41:57.215 --> 42:00.018
You could move in with me,
but I don't live anywhere.
