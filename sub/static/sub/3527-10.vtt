WEBVTT

00:00.261 --> 00:02.181
Previously on the tudors.

00:02.181 --> 00:07.281
It is my contention that this
marriage can be dissolved by no power,

00:07.281 --> 00:09.311
human or divine.

00:09.651 --> 00:12.631
You know perfectly well what the
king desires and what he shall have.

00:12.631 --> 00:15.381
My only satisfaction is
that in frustrating you

00:15.381 --> 00:17.911
I hasten your fall from
the king's good graces.

00:17.911 --> 00:19.321
I have a book to show you.

00:19.321 --> 00:24.061
These writers say that the king is both
emperor and pope absolutely in his own kingdom.

00:24.061 --> 00:27.021
Every day brings more news of
the virulence of this heresy.

00:27.021 --> 00:28.541
Of what do you speak, papa?

00:28.541 --> 00:30.281
The disease of lutheranism.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.961
Surely it won't come here?

00:32.651 --> 00:34.321
It is already here.

00:34.721 --> 00:36.001
You are leaving me.

00:36.001 --> 00:38.011
You're married.

00:38.011 --> 00:40.701
You must never ask to
see me again. You promise?

00:40.701 --> 00:42.931
Do you love another? Is that it?

00:43.301 --> 00:45.681
We were never legally man and wife.

00:45.681 --> 00:49.231
By all the angels I was
intact when I came to your bed.

00:49.231 --> 00:51.801
Alright! So you were a fucking virgin!

00:52.121 --> 00:54.311
That's not the point!

00:54.311 --> 00:59.201
We have decided that this great matter
is too important to be here decided

00:59.201 --> 01:04.321
but to prorogue this
tribunal until october 1st.

01:04.321 --> 01:05.901
Cardinal wolsey!

01:05.901 --> 01:10.631
You are here charged with derogating
the king's lawful authority.

01:10.631 --> 01:13.321
Majesty! Your majesty!

01:13.321 --> 01:14.851
Majesty!

01:14.851 --> 01:16.901
I need to appoint a new chancellor.

01:17.231 --> 01:18.371
Someone I can trust.

01:18.371 --> 01:19.721
I don't want to be chancellor.

01:19.721 --> 01:21.701
You will do as I command!

01:21.701 --> 01:24.681
I've been waiting for so long. For what?

01:24.681 --> 01:26.281
We will have sons!

01:26.281 --> 01:29.671
No! No. Your wife won't let
you go. I should have realized.

01:29.671 --> 01:32.091
Stay here, I beg you. Anne!

01:32.091 --> 01:34.871
I'm the king of england!

01:35.751 --> 01:37.811
You think you know a story.

01:37.811 --> 01:40.121
But you only know how it ends.

01:40.121 --> 01:42.591
To get to the heart of the story,

01:42.591 --> 01:45.091
you have to go back to the beginning.

<font color="#ffff00">THE TUDORS
Season 01 Episode 10</font>

03:59.741 --> 04:01.881
His majesty the king!

04:24.561 --> 04:27.171
My lords and councilors,

04:27.551 --> 04:30.321
there is a great deal of work to do.

04:30.321 --> 04:34.981
In the past, those who held the
reins of government deceived me...

04:35.771 --> 04:40.321
many things were done without
my knowledge or my approval.

04:40.321 --> 04:45.171
But such proceedings
will stop in the future.

04:46.331 --> 04:50.521
Your grace will be appointed
president of the council...

04:51.071 --> 04:54.521
jointly with the duke of suffolk.

04:55.491 --> 04:57.151
Your majesty.

04:57.151 --> 05:00.241
We shall convene again very shortly.

05:00.241 --> 05:04.961
To discuss those matters which
remain close to our hearts.

05:14.331 --> 05:16.341
A word!

05:18.371 --> 05:22.471
Although it pleases me much that
wolsey is no longer here among us...

05:23.441 --> 05:26.131
yet even in his absence,

05:26.531 --> 05:28.971
does he not cause you disquiet?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.421
How so?

05:31.421 --> 05:34.821
He was attaindered, but not for treason.

05:36.071 --> 05:37.911
Which means he still lives.

05:37.911 --> 05:42.311
And so long as he lives, he remains
a danger both to the realm and to us.

05:42.311 --> 05:43.991
He is far away in york.

05:43.991 --> 05:46.011
In disgrace.

05:46.011 --> 05:47.611
I think you exaggerate the danger.

05:47.611 --> 05:51.621
And I think that you
don't understand it!

05:51.621 --> 05:54.551
The king, as you know,
could easily change his mind.

05:54.551 --> 05:58.791
And if he did, if wolsey
ever returned to this court...

05:58.791 --> 06:02.501
we would both have cause
enough to fear his vengeance.

06:04.631 --> 06:08.281
CBUTCB HOUSE OF
CARDINAL WOLSEY YORKSBIRE

06:21.301 --> 06:25.341
This is intolerable. We
must have the roof mended.

06:26.031 --> 06:28.521
With what? And by whom?

06:28.981 --> 06:32.931
We have no money and no bloody servants.

06:35.441 --> 06:39.031
Surely the king never meant
you to live so wretchedly?

06:39.401 --> 06:42.551
After all, you are
still archbishop of york!

06:43.221 --> 06:46.001
Well, perhaps it's not the king's fault.

06:47.511 --> 06:51.411
I have had cause to
remember the old prophecy:

06:51.631 --> 06:54.411
"When the cow rideth the bull,

06:54.411 --> 06:57.631
then,priest, beware thy skull.

06:57.631 --> 06:59.931
" You mean that cow anne boleyn?

06:59.931 --> 07:01.321
Indeed so.

07:01.321 --> 07:04.281
Which is why I'm
writing her this letter.

07:05.761 --> 07:08.181
Even if she is the
cause of all our misery?

07:08.181 --> 07:12.471
Well yes, since she's the
cause, she can also be the cure.

07:13.651 --> 07:17.781
If I could only persuade her that
I am not her enemy, but her friend.

07:18.171 --> 07:21.301
I still have the letter
in which she promises

07:21.301 --> 07:24.861
to reward me for all
my pains and efforts at

07:24.861 --> 07:27.661
such time as she becomes crowned.

07:27.661 --> 07:32.221
I seem to remember that, at the time,
you thought her promises rather amusing.

07:32.221 --> 07:34.571
Well yes, perhaps I did.

07:35.431 --> 07:40.691
Since then I have rather
lost my sense of humour.

07:40.691 --> 07:42.321
Sir thomas,

07:42.321 --> 07:45.871
I notice you allow yourself none of
the trappings of your great office.

07:45.871 --> 07:50.341
I'm not so vain as to display
its power, master cromwell.

07:50.911 --> 07:54.881
But I tell you this I
fully intend to use it.

07:58.721 --> 08:01.541
May I ask... to what effect?

08:01.541 --> 08:03.441
Here.

08:03.781 --> 08:07.601
Here is a report of a sermon
recently given in cambridge

08:07.601 --> 08:12.791
by a certain hugh latimer a
senior member of the university.

08:12.791 --> 08:18.121
"Mr. Latimer said that holy
scripture should be read

08:18.121 --> 08:22.161
"in the english tongue
of all christian people,

08:22.161 --> 08:24.771
"whether priest or layman!

08:25.401 --> 08:29.571
"He raged against the gilding of
images, "the running of pilgrimages,

08:29.571 --> 08:32.721
and superstitious devotion!

08:34.140 --> 08:37.581
"He said that all men were priests

08:37.581 --> 08:43.010
and that we had no need for
priests or popes on earth!

08:44.491 --> 08:47.611
" Times have changed, master cromwell.

08:48.141 --> 08:50.581
I plainly see the risk

08:50.581 --> 08:55.721
and the danger involved in such an
opendoor policy towards these newfangled,

08:55.721 --> 08:58.281
erroneous sects.

08:58.691 --> 09:02.831
You condemn all reformers as heretics?

09:03.161 --> 09:06.231
Wolsey was far too soft on them.

09:08.801 --> 09:11.471
I intend not to be.

09:12.181 --> 09:14.571
Will you burn them?

09:19.111 --> 09:21.361
"This belief that the pope
and the clergy possess separate

09:21.361 --> 09:24.611
"power and authority is
contrary to scripture.

09:24.611 --> 09:30.571
"The king is the representative of
god on earth "and his law is god's law!

09:31.051 --> 09:36.971
The ruler is accountable to god alone and the obedience
of his subjects is an obedience required by god!

09:40.841 --> 09:43.631
" "For the church and the pope
to rule the princes of europe

09:43.631 --> 09:48.551
"is not only a shame above all shames
"but an inversion of the divine order.

09:49.031 --> 09:54.031
One king, and one law in
god's name in every realm.

09:54.031 --> 09:57.941
" This book is a book
for me, and for all kings.

09:58.371 --> 10:00.671
And there are other books like it!

10:00.671 --> 10:03.711
Books which detail the
abuses of power, privileges,

10:03.711 --> 10:07.281
the greed of the clergy
in your majesty's realm.

10:07.281 --> 10:11.181
Books which wolsey deliberately
kept hidden from you.

10:15.901 --> 10:18.331
I should like to read them.

10:18.331 --> 10:20.111
Now that I've taken power unto myself,

10:20.111 --> 10:23.651
I shall work day and night, if
necessary, to resolve things.

10:23.651 --> 10:26.431
Including my annulment.

10:26.941 --> 10:30.821
I swear to you now,
everything will be different.

10:36.001 --> 10:38.581
His majesty the king!

10:46.261 --> 10:47.841
Ambassador chapuys.

10:47.841 --> 10:49.781
Your majesty.

10:50.231 --> 10:53.721
I hear you're a very able
and intelligent diplomat.

10:54.211 --> 10:58.661
Like me, I'm sure you're aware of
all the new religious controversies.

10:58.661 --> 11:03.641
I know of some new heresies that have
sprung up here and there, certainly.

11:04.171 --> 11:08.071
If only the pope and his cardinals could
set aside their vain pomp and ceremony,

11:08.071 --> 11:12.921
and start living according to the precepts
of the gospels and the early fathers.

11:14.261 --> 11:18.911
I am well aware that your majesty is in
the midst of an argument with his holiness.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.841
Ha!

11:20.841 --> 11:23.751
I'm not talking about myself.

11:24.071 --> 11:28.681
You see, excellence, when luther attacked the
vice and corruption of the clergy, he was right.

11:29.361 --> 11:32.381
Had he stopped there, and not gone on
to destroy the sacraments, and so on,

11:32.381 --> 11:37.141
I would have gladly raised my pen in
his defense, rather than attacking him.

11:38.541 --> 11:41.931
The need for reformation
in the church is manifest.

11:42.531 --> 11:45.351
The emperor has a duty to promote it.

11:45.351 --> 11:48.411
As do I in my own domain.

11:49.651 --> 11:53.361
I'm glad we've had this
opportunity to exchange opinions.

11:54.571 --> 11:56.141
Your majesty.

11:56.141 --> 11:57.801
Ambassador.

12:02.631 --> 12:05.131
I'm surprised you have so much time.

12:05.131 --> 12:07.361
- To do what?
- To do nothing!

12:07.831 --> 12:08.591
What are you saying?

12:08.591 --> 12:11.461
Aren't you supposed to
be running the country?

12:11.461 --> 12:13.841
I leave that to norfolk.
He's had more practice.

12:13.841 --> 12:17.781
And in any case, meetings with
ambassadors are infinitely tedious.

12:17.781 --> 12:20.201
They're all liars,
hypocrites and middleaged men.

12:20.201 --> 12:22.501
Would you prefer them to be women?

12:22.501 --> 12:28.011
My friend, if all ambassadors were beautiful
women I'd be serving my country day and night.

12:28.971 --> 12:30.771
Ah, here we are!

12:30.771 --> 12:32.311
Your grace.

12:32.311 --> 12:36.401
Let me present my ward, miss catherine brooke.
This is sir anthony knivert. Miss catherine.

12:36.401 --> 12:37.651
Sir.

12:37.651 --> 12:39.311
Anthony is one of our finest horsemen.

12:39.311 --> 12:41.201
Except for when I fall off.

12:41.921 --> 12:43.591
- Are you enjoying your walk?
- Yes, your grace.

12:43.591 --> 12:46.221
Good. Then I shan't
delay you any further.

12:52.411 --> 12:54.041
A pretty little thing, isn't she?

12:54.041 --> 12:56.251
Indeed she is.

12:56.251 --> 12:58.511
I'm going to marry her!

13:02.351 --> 13:04.411
You have been in exile, mr. Fish?

13:04.911 --> 13:06.271
Yes, sir.

13:06.271 --> 13:09.381
It was cardinal wolsey's
pleasure to keep me in holland,

13:09.381 --> 13:12.171
for fear I might speak the truth.

13:13.311 --> 13:15.781
So why did you try to return?

13:15.781 --> 13:18.661
I thought, sir,that
with the cardinal fallen

13:18.661 --> 13:23.361
and sent away that circumstances in this
country might be changed for the better.

13:23.361 --> 13:25.541
More tolerant.

13:26.911 --> 13:29.021
Do you have friends in this country?

13:29.021 --> 13:30.881
Of course, sir as an englishman.

13:30.881 --> 13:33.161
At court?

13:36.671 --> 13:39.421
Do you have friends at court?

13:44.641 --> 13:48.961
Do you deny you are
the author of this work:

13:48.961 --> 13:52.201
"A supplication for the beggars?

13:52.701 --> 13:55.091
" No, sir.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.011
What is it?

13:57.011 --> 14:02.801
Sir, an appeal to his majesty to redress many of
the terrible and scandalous abuses of the church.

14:02.801 --> 14:09.141
Uhhuh. You seem to suggest that the real aim
of the church is to seize all power, lordship,

14:09.141 --> 14:11.401
obedience and dignity from the king.

14:11.401 --> 14:12.681
In fact you go further,

14:12.681 --> 14:15.691
you claim that the church
itself is a source of rebellion

14:15.691 --> 14:19.321
and disobedience against the
king! Don't you, mr. Fish?

14:24.161 --> 14:27.541
And here, mr. Fish,

14:27.541 --> 14:34.501
if I may you say that the exactions taken from the
people are not given to a kind, temporal prince,

14:34.501 --> 14:38.541
but to a cruel, devilish bloodsucker,

14:38.541 --> 14:43.711
drunken in the blood of the
martyrs and saints of christ.

14:44.461 --> 14:46.741
Shame on you, mr. Fish.

14:46.741 --> 14:49.821
For who are these cruel,
devilish bloodsuckers...

14:49.821 --> 14:53.321
but the anointed priests
of our holy church,

14:53.321 --> 14:56.191
those who show us the way to heaven!

14:56.191 --> 15:00.181
But then, you don't believe in
that either, do you, mr. Fish?

15:06.101 --> 15:08.881
Who are you?

15:09.471 --> 15:12.101
I'm a christian man,

15:12.101 --> 15:15.471
the child of everlasting joy,

15:15.471 --> 15:18.831
through the merits of the
bitter passion of christ.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.311
This is the joyful answer.

15:24.781 --> 15:27.451
It is also heresy.

15:40.241 --> 15:43.021
What is it? What has she done?

15:43.021 --> 15:45.431
She is wearing purple.

15:45.431 --> 15:48.541
And purple is the color of royalty!

15:54.531 --> 15:59.331
You know, I sometimes wish that all
spaniards were at the bottom of the sea!

15:59.331 --> 16:01.241
Mistress boleyn,

16:01.241 --> 16:03.991
you should not abuse the
queen's honor with such language.

16:03.991 --> 16:06.561
I care nothing for katherine.

16:06.561 --> 16:11.221
I would rather see her hanged than
acknowledge her as my mistress!

16:20.731 --> 16:22.211
Is that it?

16:22.211 --> 16:24.311
Yes your majesty.

16:24.711 --> 16:26.801
Thank god.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.271
What is it, mr. Cromwell?

16:39.591 --> 16:42.321
Your majesty, I...

16:42.731 --> 16:45.081
mr. Cromwell!

16:45.081 --> 16:48.931
I must beg your majesty's indulgence,
and forgiveness, before I...

16:49.251 --> 16:51.591
Go on.

16:51.591 --> 16:55.341
I had cause, recently, on
a visit to waltham abbey,

16:55.341 --> 16:57.911
to speak to a learned friend there.

16:57.911 --> 17:01.221
We spoke... about your
majesty's great matter.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.241
We...

17:03.241 --> 17:06.641
we came to the conclusion that
your majesty's advisers might not,

17:06.641 --> 17:10.501
perhaps, be approaching the matter in
the most convenient way to solve it.

17:10.501 --> 17:11.891
You mean through the courts?

17:11.891 --> 17:17.421
Yes. As your majesty well knows,
kings are set above the law.

17:17.421 --> 17:21.340
They are answerable to god
alone, who anointed them.

17:21.731 --> 17:27.431
So it seems to us that the matter is
not and never has been a legal one.

17:31.881 --> 17:34.701
It is a theological one.

17:34.701 --> 17:38.101
But in that case who
should pass verdict upon it?

17:39.311 --> 17:42.961
We would suggest that your
majesty canvas the opinion

17:42.961 --> 17:47.001
of theologians at
colleges around europe.

17:47.001 --> 17:51.731
Their sentence would be soon pronounced, and
could be implemented with little enough industry.

17:51.731 --> 17:54.301
But by that simple measure,

17:54.301 --> 17:58.881
I trust that your majesty's troubled
conscience might be pacified.

17:58.881 --> 18:02.521
Will you write a paper
showing your argument?

18:03.061 --> 18:04.491
If your majesty trusts me to do so.

18:04.491 --> 18:07.651
No. I command you to do so.

18:07.651 --> 18:12.001
And then I command you, as a royal agent,
to visit the universities in europe.

18:12.001 --> 18:16.881
I want the opinion of their theological
faculties as soon as possible!

18:20.111 --> 18:23.971
Thank you, mr. Cromwell.

18:59.491 --> 19:02.961
There is still time to recant
of your heresy, mr. Fish.

19:04.291 --> 19:09.031
If you acknowledge that
your opinions were misguided,

19:09.031 --> 19:11.131
evil,

19:11.131 --> 19:13.421
contrary to the law of god...

19:13.421 --> 19:17.811
then you will be spared the great
pains you must otherwise endure.

19:20.301 --> 19:23.681
I beg of you acknowledge your sins.

19:24.051 --> 19:27.101
God will welcome you back into his fold.

19:28.211 --> 19:32.461
Recant.

19:32.461 --> 19:35.311
You still have a moment.

19:36.871 --> 19:42.091
The lord is my shepherd,
I can want nothing.

19:42.571 --> 19:47.861
He feedeth me in green pastures,
he leadeth me to fresh waters...

19:47.861 --> 19:51.701
though I should walk now in the
valley of the shadow of death,

19:51.701 --> 19:56.811
yet I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me...

19:57.171 --> 20:01.351
thy staff and thy
shield will comfort me,

20:01.981 --> 20:04.621
thou preparest a table for me,

20:04.621 --> 20:07.511
against mine enemies,

20:07.511 --> 20:09.431
my head thou anoints with oil,

20:09.431 --> 20:14.881
and filleth my cup full
oh let thy lovingkindness

20:14.881 --> 20:19.461
and mercy follow me
all the days of my life,

20:19.921 --> 20:23.591
that I mayest dwell in
the lord's house for ever.

21:43.581 --> 21:46.161
I have something I want to say to you.

21:46.581 --> 21:50.011
I have decided to ennoble
you and your family.

21:50.381 --> 21:53.571
You are to be created earl
of wilshire and ormonde

21:53.571 --> 21:56.831
and I am also appointing
you lord privy seal.

21:57.811 --> 22:00.071
George will become lord rochford,

22:00.071 --> 22:02.691
and be made a member of council.

22:02.691 --> 22:06.151
Your majesty I am lost for words.

22:08.131 --> 22:10.851
Your bounty is unceasing.

22:14.181 --> 22:17.521
I also have high hopes for mr. Cromwell.

22:17.521 --> 22:20.851
I'm glad. He is a friend of the family.

22:22.101 --> 22:24.931
You know his thesis!

22:25.941 --> 22:29.541
I want you to visit the pope
and the emperor at bologna

22:30.061 --> 22:33.711
I want you to put to them our new case.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.951
Please tell me you are not losing hope?

22:42.831 --> 22:45.271
It's true. I...

22:45.271 --> 22:47.851
I had always fancied that the king,

22:47.851 --> 22:51.581
after pursuing his course for
some time, would turn away,

22:51.911 --> 22:55.691
would yield to his conscience,

22:55.691 --> 22:58.601
as he has done so often before.

22:58.601 --> 23:03.361
I believed with all my heart
that he would return to reason...

23:03.361 --> 23:06.151
but now, I...

23:06.151 --> 23:08.751
madam, I pray you.

23:08.751 --> 23:11.331
Don't give way.

23:11.831 --> 23:13.991
No, excellence.

23:13.991 --> 23:17.041
I shall never give way.

23:20.191 --> 23:23.291
Thank you for what you
have done for my father.

23:23.291 --> 23:26.681
For my whole family.

23:27.011 --> 23:30.871
There is more...

23:31.211 --> 23:35.741
I've made alterations to
wolsey's old palace at york place.

23:35.741 --> 23:38.551
You said you liked it...

23:38.841 --> 23:41.611
I am giving it to you.

23:48.421 --> 23:50.831
What is it?

23:51.181 --> 23:53.391
Have I made you unhappy?

23:53.391 --> 23:55.431
No.

23:55.431 --> 23:59.481
I would only be unhappy if
you ever stopped loving me.

23:59.481 --> 24:03.151
London would have to melt
into the thames first.

24:14.191 --> 24:17.241
It is everything now for the lady anne!

24:19.151 --> 24:22.511
Sir thomas, does this not
remind you of a wedding feast?

24:23.201 --> 24:26.451
It seems to me that nothing
is wanted but a priest

24:26.451 --> 24:29.941
to give away the nuptial rings
and pronounce the blessing.

24:29.941 --> 24:32.361
God forbid that should happen.

24:33.981 --> 24:36.001
It's none of my business.

24:36.661 --> 24:40.211
My new job as chancellor
will be to do my utmost

24:40.211 --> 24:43.271
to contend for the
interests of christendom.

24:44.941 --> 24:49.581
Perhaps the king's majesty is more inclined
towards the reformers than you know.

24:49.581 --> 24:51.551
I don't think so.

24:51.551 --> 24:54.631
I know him better than
you do, excellence.

24:54.631 --> 24:57.751
His deepest instincts are
traditional and faithful.

24:57.751 --> 25:00.481
He may threaten to break with rome,

25:00.481 --> 25:03.121
but I don't think he will ever do so.

25:03.121 --> 25:05.421
I hope you are right.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.641
The consequences would be unthinkable.

25:13.711 --> 25:16.331
Everything seems to move
in your favor, your grace.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.311
I have bad news.

25:20.311 --> 25:27.391
I happen to know that the king has sent
wolsey an intaglio portrait of himself.

25:28.311 --> 25:30.301
So?

25:30.301 --> 25:33.841
So, it is traditionally
a sign of goodwill.

25:33.841 --> 25:36.561
It may presage a reconciliation.

25:36.561 --> 25:39.941
A small gift to ease the king's
conscience is hardly a sign t

25:39.941 --> 25:42.571
hat the bishop of york will be
restored to his former glory.

25:44.001 --> 25:48.831
Think of it this way: After satan fell
from heaven, was he ever invited back?

25:52.021 --> 25:54.351
You were.

25:55.351 --> 25:59.081
I see that you have accepted the
patronage of mr. Cromwell, mr. Wyatt.

26:01.631 --> 26:04.691
How very transparent the world is!

26:05.791 --> 26:08.531
But was I wrong to do so, mr. Tallis?

26:11.651 --> 26:13.561
I think so. Yes.

26:13.901 --> 26:16.641
You should be your own man.

26:17.051 --> 26:19.041
Don't be a fool, tallis.

26:19.041 --> 26:23.031
You never will survive long in this slippery
world without the support of a great man.

26:24.021 --> 26:26.621
You think mr. Cromwell is a great man?

26:26.621 --> 26:29.921
No, I think he's a
coming man! Mark my words.

26:39.501 --> 26:42.291
For what it's worth, I did fuck her!

26:59.571 --> 27:01.771
What is it, thomas?

27:02.421 --> 27:05.971
I have had a reply to my letter.

27:05.971 --> 27:08.791
From mistress boleyn?

27:08.791 --> 27:11.561
What did she say?

27:12.261 --> 27:16.511
That she will not speak
to the king on my behalf.

27:17.901 --> 27:20.761
Then our hopes are over!

27:21.391 --> 27:25.121
No.

27:25.121 --> 27:33.491
I have resolved to write to
another lady who is far greater,

27:33.491 --> 27:36.931
far greater than that mischievous whore

27:38.611 --> 27:42.331
and far more likely to be kind.

27:54.571 --> 27:56.171
Madam,

27:56.171 --> 27:58.461
the king is here.

28:12.951 --> 28:15.611
Please. Be seated.

28:15.611 --> 28:18.451
Majesty.

28:19.411 --> 28:21.751
I came because I heard you were unwell.

28:21.751 --> 28:25.371
And that it was necessary for
the physician to have bled you.

28:26.311 --> 28:27.931
How are you feeling now?

28:27.931 --> 28:32.611
I am very well. Your majesty
is kind to show concern.

28:35.921 --> 28:38.121
How is our daughter?

28:39.101 --> 28:41.221
She writes to me in perfect latin,

28:41.221 --> 28:43.511
and tells me she dances
the galliards every day,

28:43.511 --> 28:47.511
and can play the lute, much to
everyone's satisfaction and joy.

28:47.511 --> 28:49.081
You should be proud of her.

28:49.081 --> 28:51.951
I am proud of her.

28:52.551 --> 28:56.311
You ought to invite her to court, you
could watch her dancing and playing.

28:56.311 --> 28:58.671
It might please you.

28:58.671 --> 28:59.701
Katherine,

28:59.701 --> 29:03.001
I I hear that several of your
agents have been sent abroad

29:03.001 --> 29:05.841
to canvas theological
opinion about the divorce.

29:08.101 --> 29:11.351
For every scholar that votes for you,

29:11.351 --> 29:15.601
I could find a thousand
who would vote for me!

29:34.291 --> 29:36.291
My lords...

29:36.291 --> 29:40.151
every day I'm forced to read
new reports of dissatisfaction,

29:40.151 --> 29:43.981
confusion and delays
throughout my kingdom.

29:45.551 --> 29:51.341
My exchequer is empty and we are
borrowing money at a biting rate!

29:54.121 --> 29:56.531
Your graces are
presidents of this council.

29:56.531 --> 30:01.791
And yet I hear nothing from you on
these matters, nor any other matter.

30:03.361 --> 30:04.391
Your majesty must forgive me,

30:04.391 --> 30:07.031
I yes, yes, I know I must forgive
you, I must always forgive you.

30:07.031 --> 30:10.151
But I grow tired of forgiving you!

30:10.491 --> 30:12.511
I have given you everything,

30:12.511 --> 30:16.371
including the right to
call yourself prince!

30:16.371 --> 30:19.081
And what do I get in return?

30:21.551 --> 30:24.061
I used to think the cardinal vain,

30:24.061 --> 30:26.431
selfserving and greedy,

30:26.431 --> 30:29.191
just as you told me!

30:29.191 --> 30:32.701
But now I understand
the burden he carried...

30:32.701 --> 30:36.161
uncomplainingly.

30:36.581 --> 30:41.831
Your majesty should not forget
that he also stole from you,

30:41.831 --> 30:47.291
and he served the interests of the
french even above those of england.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.821
Is that what you think, thomas?

30:53.601 --> 30:59.681
It is certainly true that the cardinal
was vainglorious beyond measure.

30:59.681 --> 31:02.401
It did him tremendous harm,

31:02.971 --> 31:06.851
and made him abuse the
considerable gifts god gave him.

31:07.391 --> 31:15.831
And yet he is a better man than any of
you for managing this kingdom's matters!

31:22.961 --> 31:24.391
I will talk to him.

31:24.391 --> 31:26.331
Yes, you must!

31:27.071 --> 31:29.761
Ambassador chapuys, your majesty.

31:34.331 --> 31:36.061
Ambassador.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.181
I have a letter for your majesty.

31:38.181 --> 31:40.091
From the emperor?

31:40.091 --> 31:43.991
No. From cardinal wolsey.

31:44.401 --> 31:48.851
S is... so strange. Do
you know what it says?

31:49.621 --> 31:54.461
The cardinal is offering to create
a rapprochement between you and he,

31:54.461 --> 31:56.951
the emperor, and rome.

31:56.951 --> 32:00.981
The coup would be signaled by
the arrival of a papal edict

32:00.981 --> 32:05.641
ordering henry to leave anne
boleyn and return to his marriage.

32:06.681 --> 32:10.241
The emperor will offer his
financial and moral support,

32:10.241 --> 32:14.041
and insist that wolsey be
reinstated as chancellor.

32:15.451 --> 32:18.091
Do you think it could work?

32:18.591 --> 32:22.181
The cardinal is nothing
if not ingenious.

32:23.841 --> 32:26.521
I want you to set up a new parliament.

32:26.521 --> 32:28.941
Important things need to be done.

32:28.941 --> 32:31.341
My exchequer is empty, for one thing.

32:31.341 --> 32:34.131
I will do as your majesty commands.

32:34.131 --> 32:37.951
But I must warn you that you may
not find this parliament as...

32:37.951 --> 32:40.511
compliant as those before.

32:40.511 --> 32:42.201
How so?

32:42.201 --> 32:48.171
Well, though I must confess to being amongst those who
called for greater tolerance and freedom of speech...

32:49.071 --> 32:54.891
I fear that the freedom so given, by your
majesty's kindness, is now openly abused.

32:56.231 --> 32:59.521
There are many dissenting
voices in the kingdom...

32:59.521 --> 33:02.351
chiefly on religious matters.

33:03.131 --> 33:05.841
There are calls for a reformation.

33:14.001 --> 33:17.171
How many have you burned, thomas?

33:17.771 --> 33:20.021
Six.

33:21.221 --> 33:23.181
All lawful,

33:23.181 --> 33:26.041
necessary and...

33:26.351 --> 33:27.961
and welldone.

33:27.961 --> 33:30.221
Welldone?

33:30.461 --> 33:32.561
Yes, harry.

33:42.111 --> 33:44.791
What did he say?

33:45.791 --> 33:47.851
In so many words,

33:47.851 --> 33:50.821
he told me that he was
inclined to pardon wolsey,

33:50.821 --> 33:54.141
and restore him to royal favour.

33:56.881 --> 34:00.191
And what did you say?

34:00.611 --> 34:04.601
I agreed with his majesty that
the cardinal had many talents.

34:04.601 --> 34:07.221
You did what?

34:07.221 --> 34:12.081
I agreed with the king that
his eminence had many talents.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.751
I cannot believe this!

34:19.170 --> 34:23.630
Have you not spoken yourself of the terrible
vengeance he would exact on all of us,

34:23.630 --> 34:26.601
if he ever again had the power?

34:28.551 --> 34:32.630
Or perhaps you don't think "vengeance"
to be one of his many "talents"!

34:32.630 --> 34:35.261
I do, indeed.

34:35.261 --> 34:39.511
Which is why I cultivate
the king's good graces.

34:46.610 --> 34:49.460
Your majesty will be pleased to
know that the university of paris,

34:49.460 --> 34:53.190
the greatest prize of all,
has declared in your favour.

34:54.130 --> 34:55.331
And italy?

34:55.331 --> 34:57.811
I confess that the
universities there are divided.

34:57.811 --> 35:02.091
But padua, florence and venice
have all declared for your majesty.

35:10.161 --> 35:14.031
Spain? Katherine's country.

35:14.031 --> 35:16.591
Spain is against.

35:17.881 --> 35:20.551
Are you surprised?

35:21.351 --> 35:23.691
And you, my lord!

35:23.691 --> 35:28.251
Did you get to see the
emperor and his holiness?

35:28.251 --> 35:30.281
How are they?

35:30.281 --> 35:34.651
Your majesty, the
emperor refused to see me.

35:34.651 --> 35:37.081
And his holiness?

35:37.081 --> 35:42.721
The pope simply gave me this
edict, to bring to your majesty.

35:47.411 --> 35:50.321
What does it say?

35:57.361 --> 36:02.281
The edict instructs your majesty to order
lady anne boleyn to leave your court.

36:03.001 --> 36:09.931
It refuses to allow your majesty permission to remarry
while the papal curia is deciding your majesty's case.

36:20.581 --> 36:22.481
Mr. Wyatt.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.701
I am busy.

36:23.701 --> 36:24.741
There is someone you should see.

36:24.741 --> 36:26.051
Not now, mr. Wyatt.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.331
It concerns the cardinal.

36:32.221 --> 36:34.111
Your excellency. What can I do for you?

36:34.111 --> 36:36.511
My lord, i would ask
a very great favour.

36:36.511 --> 36:39.951
These are troubled times. It seems
to me that, in certain quarters,

36:39.951 --> 36:43.691
there is now a blatant and open
hostility to our holy church.

36:43.691 --> 36:45.071
As we discovered in germany

36:45.071 --> 36:46.991
and what do you expect me to do?

36:46.991 --> 36:50.671
I beg you to use the great
influence you have, here at court,

36:50.671 --> 36:54.501
to pull england back from the
brink of catastrophe and ruin!

36:54.991 --> 36:58.641
For the love we all bear
for christ and his apostles.

36:58.641 --> 37:00.681
What apostles?

37:00.681 --> 37:04.991
I don't believe christ had
apostles not even st. Peter!

37:04.991 --> 37:10.271
Those men were all liars and charlatans who
pretended to follow christ and speak in his name.

37:10.271 --> 37:13.961
And they built a church upon their lies!

37:20.771 --> 37:22.991
Your honour... your honour...

37:23.061 --> 37:25.241
so grateful.

37:25.241 --> 37:29.251
Sir, this is augustin de augustinis.
A private physician to thomas wolsey.

37:29.251 --> 37:32.251
Wolsey. What do you know about him?

37:32.251 --> 37:38.101
Sir, I know that wolsey sought the
help of the emperor and the P... P...

37:38.101 --> 37:38.681
the pope?

37:38.681 --> 37:43.101
Yes, your honour. His holiness,
the pope, against his M...

37:43.541 --> 37:44.661
majesty.

37:44.661 --> 37:45.171
They communicated?

37:45.171 --> 37:47.571
Yes...

37:48.271 --> 37:49.721
and who else?

37:49.721 --> 37:53.291
Wolsey conspired with queen katherine,

37:53.291 --> 37:57.391
because he said it was
the only way he could be...

37:57.391 --> 37:59.571
- restored to power.
- Yes... yes...

38:00.681 --> 38:02.981
the king must know of this.

38:07.051 --> 38:10.531
Now you know the truth,
you must act against him.

38:14.271 --> 38:18.971
He and his fellow priests and prelates
think they can control your majesty's realm!

38:18.971 --> 38:22.011
That they are higher than you...

38:23.231 --> 38:29.631
and by taking instruction from the pope, was not
wolsey acting as an agent of a foreign country?

38:30.301 --> 38:32.061
The presumptionf the pope!

38:32.061 --> 38:36.701
Thinking he could tell
you... you... what to do!

38:53.741 --> 38:56.211
Hold! You within! In
the name of the king!

38:56.211 --> 38:59.131
Get out! Get out of bed!

39:04.681 --> 39:07.491
Thomas wolsey, you are
arrested by order of the king,

39:07.491 --> 39:09.271
and charged with high treason.

39:09.821 --> 39:12.791
You will be taken from here to
london, where you will be tried.

39:12.791 --> 39:13.861
There, there joan.

39:15.641 --> 39:19.291
No tears. No tears for me, I beg you.

39:21.951 --> 39:24.541
Forgive me,

39:24.901 --> 39:27.871
that you have not
much to remember me by.

39:27.871 --> 39:29.621
No.

39:29.621 --> 39:34.991
I have a life and everything
in it to remember you by.

39:36.691 --> 39:39.091
Guards, shackle him.

39:49.131 --> 39:52.881
If I had served god as
diligently as I served the king,

39:52.881 --> 39:57.691
he would not have given
me up in my grey hairs.

40:03.301 --> 40:05.551
Move on!

40:13.301 --> 40:15.861
Joan...

40:16.501 --> 40:18.921
Joan!

40:20.881 --> 40:23.791
I regret to have to inform your majesty

40:23.791 --> 40:28.021
that I can no longer continue to
serve the emperor at this court.

40:28.801 --> 40:33.841
There is so much hatred here
for everything that is sacred

40:33.841 --> 40:39.731
and true that those who speak
brazenly of it have driven me away.

40:43.841 --> 40:46.191
You are not to blame.

40:47.671 --> 40:52.161
You have always served me
with wisdom and kindness.

40:52.161 --> 40:55.061
I will not forget it.

40:55.061 --> 40:58.491
Send my love to my nephew.

40:58.701 --> 41:01.761
I will inform his
highness of your plight

41:01.761 --> 41:06.961
and of the malice and unkindness
of his majesty towards you.

41:09.961 --> 41:12.551
Yes, tell him.

41:13.111 --> 41:15.451
But this also,

41:15.451 --> 41:18.911
for the love I bear this
country as well as him.

41:18.911 --> 41:23.571
He must not think to use force
against his majesty or his people.

41:23.821 --> 41:27.451
It would be a sin
against my conscience...

41:27.451 --> 41:30.351
and against god!

43:20.021 --> 43:27.191
Lord, we have not spoken as
long or as often as we should.

43:28.681 --> 43:32.531
I have often been about other business.

43:33.971 --> 43:39.061
If I wanted forgiveness
I should ask for it...

43:39.061 --> 43:43.641
but for all that I have done,

43:45.401 --> 43:49.141
and for all that I am yet to do,

43:49.831 --> 43:53.711
there can be no forgiveness.

43:59.081 --> 44:03.851
And yet, I think, I am not an evil man,

44:13.311 --> 44:18.791
though evil men pray
louder, seek penance,

44:18.791 --> 44:24.691
and think themselves
closer to heaven than I am.

44:24.691 --> 44:29.661
I shall not see its gates lord,

44:29.661 --> 44:35.231
nor hear your sweet
words of salvation...

44:39.831 --> 44:44.611
I have seen eternity, I swear...

44:48.881 --> 44:53.141
but it was only in a dream,
and in the morning all was gone.

45:02.661 --> 45:07.521
I know myself for what I am.

45:07.521 --> 45:14.651
And I throw my poor soul
upon your forgiveness.

45:15.351 --> 45:18.891
In the full knowledge that...

45:18.891 --> 45:25.151
I deserve none at your loving hands.

45:55.371 --> 45:59.991
Welcome... to hell!

45:59.991 --> 46:03.201
Ah!

47:04.191 --> 47:06.501
Mr. Cromwell.

47:09.241 --> 47:11.791
Majesty...

47:18.901 --> 47:23.701
cardinal wolsey is dead.

47:31.491 --> 47:34.361
I'm sorry to hear that.

47:34.741 --> 47:38.021
I wish he had lived.

47:40.571 --> 47:43.641
How did he die?

47:47.581 --> 47:50.731
He took his own life...

47:55.421 --> 47:59.891
No one must ever know.
Do you understand?

48:00.301 --> 48:05.181
No one. Never!

48:11.221 --> 48:15.661
I'll finish my game, and we'll talk.

48:22.071 --> 48:24.861
Go.

48:27.361 --> 48:33.201
Go!

49:04.421 --> 49:06.691
Sir thomas,

49:06.691 --> 49:07.941
I have just heard!

49:07.941 --> 49:09.881
By his majesty's order,

49:09.881 --> 49:14.671
fifteen senior clergymen have been
arrested for recognizing wolsey's authority.

49:14.671 --> 49:19.631
There is also a statute before parliament which
recognizes that, in matters, temporal and spiritual,

49:19.631 --> 49:26.361
the king is above the law and
shall give account to god alone!

49:26.361 --> 49:29.271
What can be done?

49:32.271 --> 49:36.651
I'm reminded of something
wolsey once told me:

49:36.651 --> 49:41.331
That I should only ever tell the king
what he ought to do, not what he could do.

49:42.411 --> 49:45.841
"For if the lion knows his own strength,

49:45.841 --> 49:49.231
no man could control him.

49:51.101 --> 49:54.571
" We're standing on
the edge of the abyss...

49:54.571 --> 49:58.021
and god knows what shall become of us!

51:15.721 --> 51:18.091
I want you.

52:16.001 --> 52:17.261
I'm going to come.

52:17.561 --> 52:19.881
No. You mustn'T.

52:37.721 --> 52:41.371
Perhaps you could imagine a
way to keep his interest more...

52:41.371 --> 52:44.231
prolonged?
