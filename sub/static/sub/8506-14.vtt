00:02.414 --> 00:06.099
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

00:06.101 --> 00:08.802
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

00:08.804 --> 00:11.515
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

00:11.517 --> 00:13.297
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

00:13.299 --> 00:15.639
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

00:15.641 --> 00:18.839
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

00:18.841 --> 00:21.241
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

00:21.243 --> 00:23.075
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

00:23.077 --> 00:26.746
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

00:28.116 --> 00:30.049
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:30.051 --> 00:32.051
Hold on to something!

00:36.691 --> 00:38.323
I want to marry you, Ray.

00:38.325 --> 00:40.125
Tragedy or heartbreak...

00:40.127 --> 00:43.028
that's how it always ends
if the man's not Carter.

00:44.465 --> 00:45.464
Agh!

00:45.466 --> 00:46.731
It's Carter!

00:46.733 --> 00:48.267
He doesn't even
remember who he was.

00:48.269 --> 00:49.934
Kendra,
what are you waiting for?

00:49.936 --> 00:52.771
If I kill Savage,
his mind will be lost.

00:53.874 --> 00:56.006
<i>I'm so sorry, Rip.</i>

00:56.008 --> 00:59.410
Who are you, Gareeb?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.758 --> 01:16.959
Ramses's men inform me
that you still refuse to speak,

01:16.961 --> 01:20.830
to reveal your name
or why you tried to kill me.

01:20.832 --> 01:22.899
Who are you?

01:22.901 --> 01:26.936
The man who is trying
to save the world from you.

01:26.938 --> 01:29.471
And how are your efforts
proceeding?

01:29.473 --> 01:33.108
You can't even stand
for lack of food and water.

01:38.282 --> 01:40.816
I will always rise up
against you.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.687
I will never give up.

01:44.689 --> 01:47.589
Soon the sky rocks
will lay waste to this kingdom,

01:47.591 --> 01:50.791
and you along with it.

01:50.793 --> 01:52.960
This cell will be your tomb.

01:55.632 --> 02:00.668
What do you know of the future
that I don't, Gareeb?

02:04.106 --> 02:06.673
Mission...

02:06.675 --> 02:08.174
almost accomplished.

02:08.175 --> 02:09.476
That bottle of Scotch
was given to me

02:09.478 --> 02:12.613
by Rob Roy MacGregor in 1689.

02:12.615 --> 02:14.180
It's not half bad.

02:14.182 --> 02:16.916
We should be toasting
to Savage's death.

02:16.918 --> 02:18.652
Apart from celebrating murder,

02:18.654 --> 02:20.586
Savage still has Carter
brainwashed.

02:20.588 --> 02:22.355
I don't know if you've been
paying attention, Professor,

02:22.357 --> 02:25.157
but murdering Savage
was always the plan.

02:25.159 --> 02:27.760
Besides, Carter reincarnates,

02:27.762 --> 02:29.495
which is more
than I can say about us.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.497
As long as he's on board
and breathing,

02:31.499 --> 02:35.100
Savage is a threat
to everyone on this ship.

02:35.102 --> 02:36.769
So what, we just kill Savage

02:36.771 --> 02:39.070
and leave Carter
a brainless drone?

02:39.072 --> 02:41.273
Yes.

02:41.275 --> 02:43.475
Sorry we're late,
but we found something.

02:43.477 --> 02:45.410
We've been running diagnostics
on Ray's suit

02:45.412 --> 02:48.246
after his battle with Savage's
Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot.

02:48.248 --> 02:50.148
The telemetry data
included a comparative scan

02:50.150 --> 02:51.483
of the robot's tech.

02:51.485 --> 02:53.151
Amazing.
This neuromorphic profile

02:53.153 --> 02:55.519
is astonishingly futuristic.

02:55.521 --> 02:57.621
Yeah, it's from 2166.

02:57.623 --> 02:59.423
Well, that's the thing.
It's not.

02:59.425 --> 03:00.891
This technology's light years
more advanced

03:00.893 --> 03:02.559
than anything from 2166.

03:02.561 --> 03:05.095
- Who cares?
- The Time Masters.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.930
They refused to take
action against Savage

03:06.932 --> 03:08.965
because he didn't pose
a threat to the timeline.

03:08.967 --> 03:10.200
But if he comes

03:10.202 --> 03:12.067
into possession
of future technology...

03:12.069 --> 03:14.203
It means he's been engaging
in exactly the same manipulation

03:14.205 --> 03:16.673
of time that the Time Council
were designed to prevent.

03:16.675 --> 03:18.874
So now they'll finally
sign off on undoing

03:18.876 --> 03:20.643
all the damage Savage
has done to the world.

03:20.645 --> 03:22.445
Last time I checked,
the Time Council

03:22.447 --> 03:24.146
was at the edge
of the timeline,

03:24.148 --> 03:26.048
and this bucket of bolts

03:26.050 --> 03:28.150
can barely hold it together
as it is.

03:28.152 --> 03:30.752
Gideon, what's the status
of the Time Drive?

03:30.754 --> 03:32.086
<i>Stable, Captain.</i>

03:32.088 --> 03:34.456
Plot a course
for the Vanishing Point.

03:34.458 --> 03:39.928
Tonight, Vandal Savage
faces justice for his crimes.

03:50.606 --> 03:55.242
Quite the reversal of fortune,
isn't it, Gareeb?

03:55.244 --> 03:59.012
4,000 years ago it was you
who was the prisoner.

03:59.014 --> 04:00.581
Ever since I met you again,

04:00.583 --> 04:03.817
I've always wondered
how you managed to escape.

04:03.819 --> 04:05.618
Another time, perhaps.
For the moment,

04:05.620 --> 04:07.354
I'm more interested in this.

04:07.356 --> 04:10.557
The brains
to your robot super-weapon.

04:10.559 --> 04:12.124
At least a century more advanced

04:12.126 --> 04:15.027
than anything
to be found in 2166.

04:15.029 --> 04:17.529
Do you have something
to ask me?

04:19.067 --> 04:22.267
How did you obtain the ability
to travel through time?

04:24.405 --> 04:26.572
From you.

04:26.574 --> 04:28.607
When I saw you again in 1975,

04:28.609 --> 04:33.645
I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.

04:33.647 --> 04:36.714
You showed a caveman fire.

04:36.716 --> 04:39.016
And I had almost 200 years

04:39.018 --> 04:41.252
to figure out
how to strike the flame.

04:41.254 --> 04:42.553
All this time,
I've been wondering

04:42.555 --> 04:43.788
why it was so difficult

04:43.790 --> 04:45.456
to locate you
throughout history.

04:45.458 --> 04:49.427
Because you've been
moving through history.

04:49.429 --> 04:51.496
Well, you'll come to learn

04:51.498 --> 04:53.497
that this is just one
of many things

04:53.499 --> 04:57.333
we have in common, Gareeb.

04:57.335 --> 04:59.569
We're both doing
what we must to save the world.

04:59.571 --> 05:03.440
Subjugating the world
to your rule is not saving it.

05:03.442 --> 05:06.410
You would create a wasteland
and call it peace.

05:06.412 --> 05:10.780
Do not misquote Tacitus
to me.

05:10.782 --> 05:12.347
I knew him well.

05:12.349 --> 05:14.116
I have lived long enough

05:14.118 --> 05:17.453
to watch civilizations
rise and fall.

05:17.455 --> 05:20.589
You weep for your son.

05:20.591 --> 05:24.326
I have held dozens
of my children

05:24.328 --> 05:27.329
as they perished from old age.

05:27.331 --> 05:30.298
You might be a Time Master,

05:30.300 --> 05:33.401
but I'm a master of time.

05:33.403 --> 05:35.269
And I play a far deeper game

05:35.271 --> 05:37.739
than you could ever hope
to comprehend.

05:40.510 --> 05:42.744
Gideon, go to maximum
on the Time Drive.

05:42.746 --> 05:45.378
<i>Inadvisable, Captain.
When Dr. Palmer siphoned power</i>

05:45.380 --> 05:47.047
<i>from the auxiliary Time Drive,
he reduced the ship...</i>

05:47.049 --> 05:48.715
Gideon!
Take us to maximum.

05:48.717 --> 05:49.817
We need to get
to the Vanishing Point

05:49.819 --> 05:51.718
as fast as possible.

05:54.389 --> 05:57.825
- Where am I?
- Somewhere safe.

05:57.827 --> 05:59.893
Safe as long
as those cuffs hold.

06:01.063 --> 06:02.762
Do you know who you are?

06:04.566 --> 06:06.699
I'm Scythian Torvil,

06:06.701 --> 06:09.335
adjunct to Lord Savage.

06:09.337 --> 06:10.470
And you will release me,

06:10.472 --> 06:12.872
or I will kill you
where you stand.

06:12.874 --> 06:16.776
Your name is Carter Hall.

06:16.778 --> 06:19.410
You used to be Prince Khufu
of the Middle Kingdom.

06:19.412 --> 06:20.445
And I am...

06:20.447 --> 06:23.081
Kendra Saunders.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.984
Oh, you seem surprised.

06:25.986 --> 06:29.187
You didn't think Lord Savage
would warn me of my enemies?

06:29.189 --> 06:32.256
Let me go and I promise you
I will show mercy.

06:32.258 --> 06:35.226
I will kill you without
making you suffer first.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.868
Not to sound
like a six-year-old,

06:43.870 --> 06:45.703
but are we there yet?

06:45.705 --> 06:49.172
No, the Waverider was severely
damaged in Savage's last attack.

06:49.174 --> 06:52.075
Yeah, I can tell by the way
she's flying.

06:54.713 --> 06:56.579
You sure you're not
pushing her too hard?

06:56.581 --> 06:59.015
The longer Savage
is on board the ship,

06:59.017 --> 07:01.718
the greater the danger
to all of us.

07:03.254 --> 07:06.188
To us, or your family?

07:06.190 --> 07:08.024
I checked with Gideon.

07:08.026 --> 07:10.692
Bringing Savage onboard
didn't change the timeline,

07:10.694 --> 07:12.260
and your family still dies.

07:12.262 --> 07:14.095
The timeline is
always in flux.

07:14.097 --> 07:15.130
Once we get
to the Vanishing Point,

07:15.132 --> 07:16.832
all will be well.

07:16.834 --> 07:19.568
Is that why you're pushing
the ship beyond its limits?

07:19.570 --> 07:22.137
This has been my ship
for the last 13 years.

07:22.139 --> 07:24.072
No one knows its limits
better than I do.

07:24.074 --> 07:25.373
Not even Gideon.

07:25.375 --> 07:26.508
The Waverider
will hold together.

07:26.510 --> 07:28.409
I promise you.

07:43.009 --> 07:44.266
Bollocks.
Gideon!

07:44.268 --> 07:46.734
<i>Time Drive failure, Captain.
The mains are offline.</i>

07:46.736 --> 07:48.603
- What happened?
- It appears the Time Drive

07:48.605 --> 07:51.406
is in need of some repair.

07:51.408 --> 07:53.175
Uh, Miss Lance,
if you wouldn't mind going,

07:53.177 --> 07:54.508
checking on our guest?

07:54.510 --> 07:55.843
On it.

07:55.845 --> 07:57.244
Mr. Jackson.
I'm going to need

07:57.246 --> 07:58.913
your assistance
in fixing the Time Drive.

07:58.915 --> 08:00.781
What if Jefferson
can't get the ship moving again?

08:00.783 --> 08:02.382
Oh, thanks for the vote
of confidence.

08:02.384 --> 08:04.685
No, what I mean is
if the ship can't be repaired,

08:04.687 --> 08:06.386
we're marooned
in the Time Stream.

08:06.388 --> 08:08.155
There really is no need
to worry.

08:08.157 --> 08:10.524
The Jumpship is equipped
with an auxiliary Time Drive,

08:10.526 --> 08:14.194
capable of a one-time jump
back to 2016.

08:14.196 --> 08:15.795
Which will not be necessary,
considering

08:15.797 --> 08:17.363
you are going to fix
the Waverider.

08:17.365 --> 08:19.999
- I'll do my best.
- That's the spirit.

08:22.838 --> 08:25.004
You look concerned, Martin.

08:25.006 --> 08:28.473
I'm remembering what Mr. Snart
said about Savage's presence

08:28.475 --> 08:31.710
on this ship being a danger
to us all.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.414
Have you spoken
with your sister Laurel lately?

08:39.653 --> 08:42.321
How do you know so much
about us?

08:42.323 --> 08:45.890
Oh, I've only had 191 years
to research my enemies.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.059
Well, then you'd know
I don't scare that easily.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.495
You should be scared...

08:51.497 --> 08:52.796
of Captain Hunter.

08:52.798 --> 08:54.631
His obsession
to save his family

08:54.633 --> 08:56.500
will be the death of you all.

08:56.502 --> 08:57.869
Thanks for the tip.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.037
Enjoy being incarcerated.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.839
Captain Hunter
lied to you so often,

09:01.841 --> 09:04.941
and still you persist
in believing him.

09:04.943 --> 09:09.179
You do know why he selected
all of you for this endeavor,

09:09.181 --> 09:10.280
don't you?

09:10.282 --> 09:11.681
Great bone structure?

09:11.683 --> 09:14.317
He chose people
he could manipulate,

09:14.319 --> 09:16.486
people that would believe
his lies.

09:16.488 --> 09:21.123
Well, the lies
I don't believe are yours.

09:21.125 --> 09:25.027
Do you blame him for putting
his family's lives first?

09:28.032 --> 09:29.631
I'd tell you to go to hell,
but you'd probably

09:29.633 --> 09:31.466
just feel at home there.

09:37.168 --> 09:40.141
<i>Okay, I've got eyes
on the Time Drive.</i>

09:40.143 --> 09:42.543
<i>There seems to be
a large crack in it.</i>

09:42.545 --> 09:44.478
Well, if the housing's intact,
we should be all right.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
I am going to need you
to re-route the power

09:46.482 --> 09:47.916
from the secondary manifold.

09:47.918 --> 09:49.083
<i>Okay.
I'm on it.</i>

09:49.085 --> 09:50.484
Gideon, what is the level

09:50.486 --> 09:52.086
of contamination
in the engine room?

09:52.088 --> 09:54.388
<i>Levels at 3% above maximum,
Captain.</i>

09:54.390 --> 09:55.389
We have to get him
out of there.

09:55.391 --> 09:56.924
Don't worry.

09:56.926 --> 09:58.125
He should be able to finish
before the radiation

09:58.127 --> 10:00.860
has any adverse effect.

10:12.340 --> 10:13.572
<i>Jefferson?</i>

10:15.109 --> 10:16.775
Mom?
What are you doing here?

10:16.777 --> 10:18.744
Good question.
I'm supposed to be

10:18.746 --> 10:20.746
meeting my son at Jitters.

10:20.748 --> 10:23.749
But clearly he misses his
old job more than his mother.

10:23.751 --> 10:25.051
I am so sorry.

10:25.053 --> 10:26.785
I must've lost track of time.

10:26.787 --> 10:29.887
Well, this should help.

10:29.889 --> 10:33.458
I know it's not much,
but it belonged to your father.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.892
At least it was going to.

10:34.894 --> 10:37.762
I bought it for him
as a birthday present

10:37.764 --> 10:38.863
before he passed.

10:38.865 --> 10:40.932
It's awesome.
Thanks.

10:40.934 --> 10:43.634
Maybe you can use it tonight.

10:43.636 --> 10:45.702
Dinner at your Grandma Louise's.

10:45.704 --> 10:47.704
Yes.
I will be there.

10:47.706 --> 10:49.273
And I won't be late.

10:49.275 --> 10:51.241
I just got to stop
by the university first.

10:51.243 --> 10:53.277
- The university?
- I got to say good-bye

10:53.279 --> 10:54.911
to a friend
who's leaving town.

10:54.913 --> 10:57.047
- But I will be there.
- 6:00.

10:57.049 --> 10:58.215
Okay.
All right, I love you.

10:58.217 --> 10:59.283
I love you too, baby.

11:03.254 --> 11:04.820
<i>Jefferson?</i>

11:04.822 --> 11:06.089
Jefferson?

11:06.091 --> 11:07.756
I did it.
I got it working.

11:07.758 --> 11:09.359
You said
he wouldn't be harmed.

11:09.361 --> 11:10.559
It must be the surge
when he brought the Time Drive

11:10.561 --> 11:12.128
back online.
Gideon?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.963
<i>Mr. Jackson has suffered
an extreme amount</i>

11:13.965 --> 11:15.198
<i>of temporal radiation exposure.</i>

11:15.200 --> 11:17.166
- That sounds ominous.
- <i>Oh, it is.</i>

11:17.168 --> 11:18.833
<i>And there's nothing I can do
to reverse the side effects.</i>

11:18.835 --> 11:20.068
What side effects?

11:20.070 --> 11:21.403
<i>Mr. Jackson's
internal organs</i>

11:21.405 --> 11:23.338
<i>are aging
at an accelerated rate.</i>

11:23.340 --> 11:25.573
<i>The rest of his body
will soon follow.</i>

11:31.348 --> 11:34.149
Why are all the snacks
in the future sugar-free?

11:34.151 --> 11:37.184
So much for progress.

11:37.186 --> 11:39.120
You remember Alexa?

11:39.122 --> 11:41.322
Yeah.
From the security deposit job.

11:41.324 --> 11:42.490
What about it?

11:42.492 --> 11:43.924
Just had a feeling
about that one,

11:43.926 --> 11:47.228
a sixth sense
things would end badly.

11:47.230 --> 11:48.462
And they would have,
if you hadn't

11:48.464 --> 11:49.497
have pulled us
out of there.

11:49.499 --> 11:50.797
So what?

11:50.799 --> 11:53.133
I'm getting
the same feeling now.

11:58.106 --> 11:59.972
Gideon, how effective were
Mr. Jackson's attempts

11:59.974 --> 12:01.641
to bring the Time Drive
back online?

12:01.643 --> 12:03.410
<i>The drive's functions
have been restored,</i>

12:03.412 --> 12:05.611
<i>but the entire system
will require a master reboot</i>

12:05.613 --> 12:08.081
<i>before we can continue on
to the Vanishing Point.</i>

12:08.083 --> 12:09.781
Yes, please begin.

12:09.783 --> 12:11.517
And in the meantime,
could you check the timeline

12:11.519 --> 12:14.119
for any variations
in my family's future?

12:14.121 --> 12:16.155
<i>I believe Miss Lance
already told you the results.</i>

12:16.157 --> 12:17.389
Please.

12:17.391 --> 12:19.824
<i>The timeline remains
unchanged.</i>

12:19.826 --> 12:21.527
Were you expecting
something different?

12:21.529 --> 12:23.595
Hope springs eternal,
Miss Lance.

12:23.597 --> 12:24.930
If it didn't,
I would've surrendered

12:24.932 --> 12:27.898
to despair a long time ago.

12:27.900 --> 12:31.602
I assume Mr. Savage
is still secure in his cell?

12:31.604 --> 12:36.274
He wasn't exactly short
on opinions on you, though.

12:36.276 --> 12:38.242
I'd imagine not.

12:38.244 --> 12:41.479
Among them being
that you would sell us out

12:41.481 --> 12:43.713
to save your family.

12:46.485 --> 12:47.717
He's not wrong.

12:52.691 --> 12:54.458
Mr. Jackson is currently
in the med bay

12:54.460 --> 12:58.095
facing death due
to temporal radiation exposure.

12:58.097 --> 12:59.829
- Wait, what?
- I sent him to fix

12:59.831 --> 13:02.331
the Time Drive.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.832
I could have gone myself.

13:03.834 --> 13:07.936
And I'm left to wonder if...

13:07.938 --> 13:09.805
in some way,

13:09.807 --> 13:13.142
I did it
because of the risk.

13:13.144 --> 13:17.612
So you sent Jax
on a suicide mission

13:17.614 --> 13:21.082
so that you could stay alive
to save your family?

13:21.084 --> 13:25.019
I don't know, Sara.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.854
That's what vexes me.

13:26.856 --> 13:29.757
You know what vexes me?

13:29.759 --> 13:32.260
Thinking that we've thrown in
with a captain

13:32.262 --> 13:35.596
who cares more about himself
than he does his crew.

13:45.555 --> 13:47.751
<i>Kendra,
are you sure about this?</i>

13:48.515 --> 13:50.527
Do you remember him?

13:51.893 --> 13:53.958
He was our son.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.233
Aldus.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.502
Do you really
expect me to believe that?

13:58.504 --> 14:02.506
I expect you to remember
your feelings.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.741
We were together.

14:04.743 --> 14:07.677
And we were happy.

14:07.679 --> 14:09.545
We were a family.

14:13.685 --> 14:15.418
Kendra, stay back!

14:23.928 --> 14:26.829
Oops.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.430
Are you okay?

14:28.432 --> 14:31.133
- I should've known better.
- But are you okay?

14:31.135 --> 14:33.668
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Stay away from him.

14:33.670 --> 14:34.970
I'll be right back.

14:34.972 --> 14:36.872
- Where are you going?
- To end this.

14:45.281 --> 14:46.647
Dr. Palmer.

14:46.649 --> 14:49.217
To what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

14:49.219 --> 14:51.285
You're gonna tell me
how to free Carter's mind.

14:51.287 --> 14:54.521
Oh, well,
all you had to do was ask.

14:57.226 --> 14:59.059
Are you sure you want me to?

14:59.061 --> 15:00.426
Of course I'm sure.

15:00.428 --> 15:02.562
Because the moment
I release him,

15:02.564 --> 15:05.165
you will lose her forever.

15:05.167 --> 15:07.400
You don't know Kendra.

15:07.402 --> 15:09.069
I know Chay-Ara.

15:09.071 --> 15:12.638
And I know the man who stands
between you and your love

15:12.640 --> 15:15.841
has stood between me and mine
for millennia.

15:15.843 --> 15:18.778
We're actually quite alike,
you and I.

15:18.780 --> 15:21.580
We're nothing alike.
You're insane.

15:21.582 --> 15:25.751
But yet Chay-Ara once loved me
as she professes to love you.

15:25.753 --> 15:28.553
Oh, you didn't know that,
did you?

15:30.090 --> 15:32.723
I don't even think
Chay-Ara remembers,

15:32.725 --> 15:34.425
but 4,000 years ago

15:34.427 --> 15:37.095
I discovered that my Chay-Ara
had been reborn

15:37.097 --> 15:40.564
but with no memory
of what had happened.

15:40.566 --> 15:42.767
Like you murdering her
and Carter.

15:42.769 --> 15:44.735
True.

15:44.737 --> 15:47.370
She had no recollection of my...

15:47.372 --> 15:50.107
my crime of passion.

15:50.109 --> 15:52.642
And she fell in love with me,

15:52.644 --> 15:56.280
very deeply.

15:56.282 --> 15:59.950
And I with her.

15:59.952 --> 16:00.984
That is perverse.

16:00.986 --> 16:03.920
No, that is fact.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.254
That is history.

16:05.256 --> 16:09.458
And we were happy,
Dr. Palmer, very happy.

16:09.460 --> 16:14.463
None of us blinded
by our cursed past

16:14.465 --> 16:16.899
until he came.

16:16.901 --> 16:17.967
He took her away from me.

16:17.969 --> 16:19.735
He poisoned her against me.

16:19.737 --> 16:21.903
He stole the happiness

16:21.905 --> 16:24.339
that we shared, Dr. Palmer.

16:27.144 --> 16:29.010
No.

16:29.012 --> 16:33.048
No.
Carter is a good man.

16:33.050 --> 16:36.984
And you are my only enemy.

16:36.986 --> 16:39.119
Am I?

16:39.121 --> 16:41.956
Or am I just a man
experiencing the same things

16:41.958 --> 16:45.359
as you are right now?

16:45.361 --> 16:48.795
We have the same enemy.

16:48.797 --> 16:52.967
If Carter's free,
you lose her.

16:54.736 --> 16:57.770
But then she would hardly be
the first woman you've lost,

16:57.772 --> 16:59.072
now, would she?

17:09.984 --> 17:12.951
I am really gonna have to beef
up our security around here.

17:12.953 --> 17:15.186
It was pretty easy
to bypass the system,

17:15.189 --> 17:16.954
considering I designed it.

17:16.957 --> 17:18.223
You like my ride?

17:18.224 --> 17:19.590
Those are some
pretty hot wheels.

17:19.593 --> 17:21.159
- Yeah.
- Maybe that's your new name.

17:22.695 --> 17:24.029
How you feeling?

17:24.031 --> 17:25.430
I'm okay.
What are you doing here?

17:25.432 --> 17:27.299
- I came to drop off a note.
- Let me guess.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.501
It says, "Hey, Felicity.
I hope you're well.

17:30.503 --> 17:32.904
I'm off to travel through time
and fight an immortal bad guy."

17:32.906 --> 17:34.405
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

17:34.407 --> 17:36.707
- That was pretty good.
- Thank you.

17:36.709 --> 17:38.276
So, obviously,
Oliver told you.

17:38.278 --> 17:39.510
Don't let his broodiness
fool you.

17:39.512 --> 17:42.346
He can be quite chatty
sometimes.

17:42.348 --> 17:43.847
He also happened to mention

17:43.849 --> 17:45.481
that you're going
on this suicide mission

17:45.483 --> 17:48.451
because you think
there's nothing for you here.

17:48.453 --> 17:50.320
You think it's
a suicide mission?

17:50.322 --> 17:52.055
I don't think going after
Vandal Savage is a vacation.

17:52.057 --> 17:54.590
But don't change the subject.
You have a life here, Ray.

17:54.592 --> 17:57.227
Actually,
everybody thinks I'm dead.

17:57.229 --> 17:58.661
Nothing puts things
in perspective

17:58.663 --> 18:00.530
more than seeing yourself
become a ghost.

18:00.532 --> 18:02.398
You're not a ghost.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.266
You just need to come back
to the world.

18:04.268 --> 18:08.070
And I will,
after we take out Savage.

18:08.072 --> 18:11.606
I became the Atom to make
the world a better place.

18:11.608 --> 18:16.511
And I'm pretty sure
that saving it counts.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.314
I'm pretty sure it does too.

18:21.952 --> 18:23.784
See you soon.

18:23.786 --> 18:25.253
You know,
I would've stayed for you.

18:25.255 --> 18:27.088
I do.
But who knows?

18:27.090 --> 18:28.423
Maybe the future Mrs. Palmer

18:28.425 --> 18:32.060
is out there somewhere
in the past,

18:32.062 --> 18:35.029
the future,
some parallel universe.

18:35.031 --> 18:38.698
Ah, I'm off
to save the world,

18:38.700 --> 18:40.467
not fall in love.

18:44.106 --> 18:46.173
"And though my soul departs
the Earth,

18:46.175 --> 18:49.109
"I count the days
till my rebirth.

18:49.111 --> 18:52.012
"I will wait across eternity

18:52.014 --> 18:54.646
for my love to come back
to me."

18:54.648 --> 18:56.748
Please.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.951
Come back.

19:02.556 --> 19:05.657
Ray?
Ray...

19:13.599 --> 19:14.830
Ray?

19:14.832 --> 19:17.473
Ray, stop!
Please.

19:17.475 --> 19:19.356
Just give me
a chance to explain.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.725
What you saw
back there, it was...

19:20.727 --> 19:22.827
What?
Wasn't what it looked like?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.128
You were reciting a love poem

19:24.130 --> 19:25.563
to your brainwashed
ex-boyfriend.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.530
I am just trying
to help Carter remember

19:27.532 --> 19:29.700
who he really is.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.835
Your soul mate.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.403
Yeah, that's the part
in the conversation where you're

19:33.405 --> 19:35.472
supposed to say,
"No, Ray, you're my soul mate."

19:35.474 --> 19:38.976
Ray, you know
that I love you.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.878
Ah, I know.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.980
It's just not enough.

19:43.982 --> 19:46.983
I can't believe I'm saying it,
but Savage was right.

19:46.985 --> 19:49.685
Loving you is like a curse.

19:49.687 --> 19:51.420
Oh, Ray.

19:51.422 --> 19:53.422
You have to know,
whatever he said,

19:53.424 --> 19:56.325
he's just trying
to get inside your head.

19:56.327 --> 19:58.027
I know that.

19:58.029 --> 20:00.495
But he's right.

20:00.497 --> 20:03.197
Kendra, I-I don't think
I can do this anymore.

20:03.199 --> 20:05.566
What are you saying?

20:05.568 --> 20:08.003
Oh, what?
You want to end things?

20:08.005 --> 20:10.005
Unless you can tell me
that I'll ever be anything more

20:10.007 --> 20:12.040
than just Carter's placeholder.

20:16.379 --> 20:18.112
Ray.

20:20.616 --> 20:22.683
Are you certain
these results are accurate?

20:22.685 --> 20:24.885
Jefferson's blood chemistry
is akin to that of a...

20:24.887 --> 20:26.386
<i>A 63-year-old man.</i>

20:26.388 --> 20:28.488
Actually, I don't feel
a day over 60.

20:28.490 --> 20:31.992
- This isn't funny.
- No, and it's all Rip's fault.

20:31.994 --> 20:33.460
<i>I'm afraid he's also
suffering</i>

20:33.462 --> 20:35.361
<i>from early-stage
osteoarthritis.</i>

20:35.363 --> 20:37.229
The exposure
to the temporal radiation

20:37.231 --> 20:40.700
has led to an accelerated rate
of intracellular degeneration.

20:40.702 --> 20:43.870
This is what happens
when Rip goes with Plan B.

20:43.872 --> 20:47.040
Plan A being taking Savage's
head in with that mace.

20:47.042 --> 20:49.709
We're endeavoring to resolve
this without bloodshed.

20:49.711 --> 20:52.044
And how's that working out
for you, Gandhi?

20:52.046 --> 20:54.179
Look, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

20:54.181 --> 20:56.048
We can talk to Hunter.

20:56.050 --> 20:58.650
Even if Kendra
was to kill Savage,

20:58.652 --> 21:00.518
my situation's still the same.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.088
We're talking
about our situation, Pops.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.857
We're not waiting around
for the other shoe to drop.

21:07.827 --> 21:09.894
You deserve better.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.132
Alexa?

21:15.134 --> 21:16.801
You bet your ass.

21:19.072 --> 21:20.171
We need to talk.

21:20.173 --> 21:21.939
We saw what you did to Jax.

21:21.941 --> 21:23.674
And we're worried
it's just the beginning.

21:23.676 --> 21:26.009
- The beginning of what?
- It's like I said, Rip.

21:26.011 --> 21:28.978
As long as Savage is alive
and on this ship,

21:28.980 --> 21:30.446
he is dangerous.

21:30.448 --> 21:31.781
The Time Drive is rebooting.

21:31.783 --> 21:33.382
We will soon be on our way.

21:33.384 --> 21:35.051
I'm asking for
a little faith, gentlemen.

21:35.053 --> 21:38.521
Sorry, fresh out.

21:38.523 --> 21:40.523
I take it you and Mr. Snart
are of the same mind?

21:40.525 --> 21:42.624
Yes.

21:42.626 --> 21:44.727
And what of you, Miss Lance?

21:44.729 --> 21:46.195
You're the one
who said you'd sell us out

21:46.197 --> 21:48.597
for your family.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.132
Well, if that's
how you all feel, none of you

21:50.134 --> 21:52.167
is obliged to continue
on this voyage with me.

21:52.169 --> 21:54.036
As I told Martin,
the Jumpship

21:54.038 --> 21:56.404
can make a one-time voyage
back to 2016.

21:56.406 --> 21:58.073
Are you saying it's ours?

21:58.075 --> 21:59.540
I'm saying
that this mission

21:59.542 --> 22:01.642
has always been
a voluntary enterprise.

22:01.644 --> 22:03.778
And the mission
was to kill Savage.

22:03.780 --> 22:07.148
Which doesn't seem
to be on the table anymore.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.515
Very well.
Leave, if that's what you...

22:08.517 --> 22:09.884
It's been a blast, Rip.

22:09.886 --> 22:11.919
Good luck getting
to the Vanishing Point.

22:11.921 --> 22:13.354
Tell your pals Chronos says,

22:13.356 --> 22:15.922
"Kiss my ass."

22:20.362 --> 22:22.028
What about you, Sara?

22:24.699 --> 22:26.733
Never been one
to run from a fight.

22:42.016 --> 22:43.949
Hi.

22:43.951 --> 22:45.751
Impossible.

22:45.753 --> 22:48.087
When I saw you last...

22:48.089 --> 22:49.721
I know.

22:55.228 --> 22:57.695
A miracle...

22:57.697 --> 23:00.165
when I thought there were
none left to be had.

23:03.336 --> 23:05.703
I needed to see you.

23:05.705 --> 23:09.739
Look, I don't know how, but I'm
gonna get you out of here.

23:09.741 --> 23:12.843
This isn't your fight anymore,
Ta-er Al-Sahfer.

23:12.845 --> 23:14.812
I'm not gonna
let you rot here.

23:14.814 --> 23:17.214
Not when you're in here
because of me.

23:17.216 --> 23:21.251
I am in here
because of my choices, beloved.

23:21.253 --> 23:25.121
I made them
ready to accept my punishment.

23:25.123 --> 23:26.956
I won't leave you in here.

23:26.958 --> 23:30.059
If you love me, you will.

23:30.061 --> 23:34.063
If you love me, you will leave
this place far behind,

23:34.065 --> 23:36.732
and live a life
unburdened by your past.

23:36.734 --> 23:38.534
It's easier said than done.

23:38.536 --> 23:41.002
Anything worth doing
always is.

23:50.580 --> 23:54.115
Well, finally an intellect
approximate to my own.

23:54.117 --> 23:56.885
My imprisonment was starting
to get dreary, Professor.

23:56.887 --> 23:59.887
I'm not here
to play mind games with you.

23:59.889 --> 24:02.122
I'm here to ask you
if you remember a night

24:02.124 --> 24:03.757
in October, 1975,

24:03.759 --> 24:05.659
a place called
the Greyhill Building.

24:05.661 --> 24:08.128
That night,
you and your acolytes...

24:08.130 --> 24:09.796
Were celebrating
the acquisition

24:09.798 --> 24:12.333
of your friend
Carter Hall's body.

24:12.335 --> 24:13.868
Yes.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.002
It's my understanding
this ritual involved

24:16.004 --> 24:18.938
you sharing your immortality
with your followers.

24:18.940 --> 24:22.808
And you wish for me to do
the same for someone else.

24:22.810 --> 24:25.979
Someone dear to you.

24:25.981 --> 24:29.115
Your nuclear counterpart,
perhaps?

24:29.117 --> 24:31.217
Yes.

24:31.219 --> 24:35.287
And as impertinent
as this may sound,

24:35.289 --> 24:37.655
I need your help.

24:37.657 --> 24:39.491
Well, clearly, your friends

24:39.493 --> 24:43.161
didn't give you
the full account of the ritual.

24:43.163 --> 24:47.232
You see, it was Carter's blood
that worked the magic.

24:47.234 --> 24:49.566
Perhaps you should talk to him.

24:49.568 --> 24:51.002
Or better yet, Dr. Palmer.

24:51.004 --> 24:53.304
I'm sure that he would be
more than happy

24:53.306 --> 24:55.039
to help you spill some.

24:55.041 --> 24:58.376
And I'm certain
you would enjoy that.

24:58.378 --> 25:02.313
Pitting me and Raymond
against Carter, against Kendra.

25:02.315 --> 25:04.415
Having all of us
at each other's throats

25:04.417 --> 25:08.151
while being stranded
in the Time Stream.

25:08.153 --> 25:11.988
But... we're not stranded.

25:11.990 --> 25:14.857
Not entirely.

25:14.859 --> 25:16.826
Thank you, Mr. Savage.

25:16.828 --> 25:21.031
As I'd hoped, you've provided me
with a solution to my problem.

25:26.070 --> 25:27.536
I don't get it, Grey.

25:27.538 --> 25:29.171
What's in here
that's gonna fix me?

25:29.173 --> 25:31.040
Well, nothing
inside the Jumpship, Jefferson,

25:31.042 --> 25:32.808
but rather the craft itself.

25:32.810 --> 25:34.743
You see, this ship
is pre-programmed

25:34.745 --> 25:36.578
to return to 2016.

25:36.580 --> 25:38.713
I've made
some additional adjustments

25:38.715 --> 25:41.849
according to the theory
of quantum-retro causality,

25:41.851 --> 25:44.052
and if my math is correct,

25:44.054 --> 25:45.286
the trip
through the Time Stream

25:45.288 --> 25:47.355
should reverse your condition.

25:47.357 --> 25:49.223
No. No.

25:49.225 --> 25:51.192
I'm not leaving you
or the team.

25:51.194 --> 25:53.161
Which is why
I'm not giving you a choice.

25:54.897 --> 25:57.030
What did you do?

25:57.032 --> 26:00.567
I've administered
a mild sedative.

26:00.569 --> 26:02.602
You roofied me again?

26:02.604 --> 26:06.373
When I tricked you
onto this ship the first time,

26:06.375 --> 26:09.109
I was only thinking of myself.

26:09.111 --> 26:10.643
Now I'm thinking of you.

26:19.287 --> 26:21.187
You can't do this!

26:21.189 --> 26:23.322
If we're separated,
you'll die!

26:23.324 --> 26:25.491
I've already lived my life,
Jefferson.

26:25.493 --> 26:29.028
Now you must live yours.
Give my love to Clarissa.

26:29.030 --> 26:30.363
Tell her I'm sorry.

26:30.365 --> 26:32.797
She deserved
a proper good-bye.

26:35.535 --> 26:37.568
Grey!
Grey, no!

26:37.570 --> 26:38.570
No!

26:50.516 --> 26:52.349
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hello.

26:52.351 --> 26:54.718
I hope you don't mind,
but I thought I'd see

26:54.720 --> 26:56.887
if I could interest you
in a lunch date.

26:56.889 --> 26:58.389
Oh, my darling.
I'm right in the middle

26:58.391 --> 27:01.992
of some research
that simply cannot wait.

27:01.994 --> 27:03.760
What's the topic?

27:05.497 --> 27:08.731
As a matter of fact,
time itself.

27:08.733 --> 27:10.366
The irony.
Oh!

27:10.368 --> 27:12.168
Damn, I completely forgot.

27:12.170 --> 27:14.637
I promised I'd meet
with some fellow academics

27:14.639 --> 27:16.472
to help resolve
an experiment of theirs.

27:16.474 --> 27:17.773
Does this experiment

27:17.775 --> 27:19.975
have anything to do
with time travel?

27:19.977 --> 27:22.110
Almost certainly.

27:22.112 --> 27:24.346
But it won't take long.

27:24.348 --> 27:27.815
In fact, I'll be home
before you even know it.

27:33.823 --> 27:36.525
Clarissa?

27:36.527 --> 27:39.527
You... you know that I love you.

27:39.529 --> 27:42.196
There's nothing I do
that isn't driven

27:42.198 --> 27:44.565
by that very thought.

27:48.204 --> 27:50.438
Now let's get the hell
out of here.

27:53.742 --> 27:56.043
- What'd you do, Poindexter?
- What do you mean?

27:56.045 --> 27:57.977
The Jumpship.
Where is it?

27:57.979 --> 28:00.380
Well, it's really
more a question of when.

28:00.382 --> 28:02.148
But, oh, yes.

28:02.150 --> 28:05.885
You both wanted
to return to 2016.

28:05.887 --> 28:07.454
Got it in one.

28:07.456 --> 28:10.623
I did what I had to do
to save Jefferson's life.

28:10.625 --> 28:12.625
Now we must do
whatever's necessary

28:12.627 --> 28:13.959
to repair the Waverider

28:13.961 --> 28:16.228
and deliver Savage
to the Vanishing Point.

28:19.333 --> 28:20.832
Oh, back so soon

28:20.834 --> 28:24.303
with the stench of defeat
written all over you.

28:24.305 --> 28:26.505
Can't say I didn't warn you.

28:26.507 --> 28:29.274
Trying to get under my skin?
Is that it?

28:29.276 --> 28:30.741
Got your little game
figured out.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.376
For all your intelligence,

28:32.378 --> 28:35.580
you still didn't manage
to make Chay-Ara yours.

28:35.582 --> 28:38.849
I wouldn't expect a psychopath
like you to understand.

28:38.851 --> 28:41.219
Kendra is free to do
what she wants.

28:41.221 --> 28:44.222
You know what I see
when I look at you?

28:44.224 --> 28:48.725
I see weakness
masquerading as goodness.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.293
I'm not the one
trapped in a cage.

28:50.295 --> 28:52.095
Well, if it weren't
for this cage,

28:52.097 --> 28:56.299
you wouldn't have
that arrogant look on your face.

28:56.301 --> 28:57.601
You think I'm afraid of you?

28:57.603 --> 29:00.604
No.
I know you are.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.606
At least Carter
had the courage

29:02.608 --> 29:04.273
to face me like a man.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.976
No wonder she didn't
choose you.

29:11.482 --> 29:12.548
Oh...

29:17.788 --> 29:19.655
You feel better now,
Dr. Palmer?

29:19.657 --> 29:21.922
Not even close.

29:34.204 --> 29:36.737
And I thought
you were nothing like me.

30:00.361 --> 30:03.095
I'll leave you
to contemplate on that.

30:21.857 --> 30:24.051
<i>Time Drive reinitialization
complete, Captain.</i>

30:24.053 --> 30:26.635
<i>The primary systems
are back online and stable.</i>

30:26.637 --> 30:28.817
Begin ignition sequence
and resume our route

30:28.819 --> 30:30.305
to the Vanishing Point.

30:30.307 --> 30:31.840
You're a fool, Professor.

30:31.842 --> 30:34.509
I'm trying to save
Jefferson's life.

30:34.511 --> 30:35.811
Savage has escaped.

30:35.813 --> 30:38.213
- What?
- I'm sorry.

30:38.215 --> 30:39.414
Pull up all the surveillance
monitors, now!

30:39.416 --> 30:40.749
<i>I'm afraid Vandal Savage</i>

30:40.751 --> 30:42.216
<i>has already freed
Carter Hall,</i>

30:42.218 --> 30:43.684
<i>and is preparing
to disengage...</i>

30:44.821 --> 30:46.453
That can't be good.

30:46.455 --> 30:48.156
Gideon's entire
operational matrix is offline.

30:48.158 --> 30:49.857
And without her help...

30:49.859 --> 30:51.826
We'll have to make our
approach the old-fashioned way.

30:51.828 --> 30:53.727
Shouldn't we be
more worried about Savage

30:53.729 --> 30:55.229
and his brainwashed crony?

30:55.231 --> 30:57.865
Yes. Which is why
I need you and Dr. Palmer

30:57.867 --> 30:59.499
to go and recapture him.

30:59.501 --> 31:01.301
In the meantime, if the rest
of us can't figure out

31:01.303 --> 31:03.069
how to pilot the ship
without Gideon,

31:03.071 --> 31:05.806
we're never gonna be able
to leave the Time Stream.

31:05.808 --> 31:08.474
If we live through this,
you bumbling idiot,

31:08.476 --> 31:10.977
I might just kill you.

31:10.979 --> 31:14.181
Exactly how old-fashioned
are you talking?

31:14.183 --> 31:17.149
So, if the Time Stream
is like this vast river,

31:17.151 --> 31:19.384
these maps plot
the safest course

31:19.386 --> 31:20.585
along that river's path.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.021
Exactly.

31:22.023 --> 31:24.824
I keep these here
just in case of emergency.

31:24.826 --> 31:26.558
Well,
this certainly qualifies.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.893
What's Jurgens Ridge?

31:27.895 --> 31:30.162
Pray you need never find out.

31:30.164 --> 31:32.198
Martin, you're gonna be
our engineer.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.998
I need you to adjust
our energy output

31:34.000 --> 31:36.234
to avoid over-taxing
the Waverider.

31:36.236 --> 31:39.670
And you, Miss Lance,
you're gonna be our navigator.

31:39.672 --> 31:42.040
I was League of Assassins,
not NASA.

31:42.042 --> 31:43.541
I need someone
who can make tough calls

31:43.543 --> 31:44.976
under extreme pressure.

31:44.978 --> 31:48.446
No one fits that description
better than you.

31:50.415 --> 31:52.415
Come to join the party?

31:52.417 --> 31:55.652
You should've left me
back in 2166!

31:55.654 --> 31:57.420
Yeah, yeah,
we know that, mullethead.

31:57.422 --> 32:00.324
Who are you to stand up
against me,

32:00.326 --> 32:03.560
Vandal Savage,
destroyer of empires?

32:03.562 --> 32:06.429
Leonard Snart,
robber of ATMs!

32:08.199 --> 32:09.698
We need more power
to the Time Drive, Martin.

32:09.700 --> 32:10.867
How much further
can we push it?

32:10.869 --> 32:13.635
25%,
and only for a brief burst.

32:13.637 --> 32:14.757
But it might be all we need.

32:20.644 --> 32:23.346
It's still two against four.

32:25.983 --> 32:27.382
Come on!

32:27.384 --> 32:28.683
Aah!

32:34.724 --> 32:36.624
What's our trajectory
looking like, Miss Lance?

32:36.626 --> 32:38.093
Just give me a second here.

32:38.095 --> 32:39.727
Well, oddly enough,
as the Vanishing Point

32:39.729 --> 32:41.495
is at the very end of time.

32:41.497 --> 32:42.963
Yeah, and we're never gonna
make it there if you don't

32:42.965 --> 32:45.799
lower the ship
negative 12 degrees on my mark.

32:45.801 --> 32:48.635
Three, two, one, now!

32:55.978 --> 32:58.978
- Did it work?
- Well, we're not dead.

32:58.980 --> 33:00.947
I got this.

33:00.949 --> 33:02.148
Handle Savage.

33:07.688 --> 33:10.990
Haircut! Move your fat head
so I can get a clean shot!

33:18.498 --> 33:19.891
They seem to be
getting closer.

33:19.893 --> 33:22.067
- I'll go help them.
- No! I'm not gonna place

33:22.069 --> 33:23.535
another one of you
in jeopardy... I'll go.

33:23.537 --> 33:25.603
But who's
gonna pilot the ship?

33:57.369 --> 34:01.004
Gareeb, I was wondering
where you were hiding.

34:01.006 --> 34:03.206
Aah!

34:04.242 --> 34:06.408
Bring her to me.

34:09.780 --> 34:12.414
Chay-Ara, my love.

34:12.416 --> 34:14.382
I'm sorry that it has to end
like this again.

34:16.286 --> 34:19.121
- Carter.
- Aah!

34:19.123 --> 34:23.623
<i>I will wait for eternity.</i>

34:23.626 --> 34:24.925
Come back to me.

34:44.946 --> 34:46.413
Aah!

34:49.118 --> 34:50.750
Kendra...

34:55.224 --> 34:58.124
Aah!

35:07.801 --> 35:08.934
He's alive.

35:11.272 --> 35:12.838
You saved him.

35:14.674 --> 35:16.974
You saved us all.

35:27.462 --> 35:28.794
Is that...?

35:28.796 --> 35:31.196
Welcome
to the Vanishing Point.

35:31.198 --> 35:32.598
I can't believe we made it.

35:35.570 --> 35:37.370
And what did you do
to your shoulder?

35:37.372 --> 35:39.238
Hmm? Oh, I might have jumped
in front of a laser blast

35:39.240 --> 35:42.074
intended for Miss Saunders.

35:42.076 --> 35:44.609
What?
I couldn't have my team thinking

35:44.611 --> 35:46.878
I cared more about myself
than them, now, could I?

35:46.880 --> 35:48.112
Really?

35:49.583 --> 35:51.283
Uh, I think I just
lost control of the ship.

35:51.285 --> 35:52.784
Yeah, that might have
something to do

35:52.786 --> 35:54.286
with us being
the most wanted time criminals

35:54.288 --> 35:55.887
in all of history.

36:00.058 --> 36:01.792
<i>Timeship Waverider,</i>

36:01.794 --> 36:04.295
<i>we've taken control
of your guidance systems.</i>

36:04.297 --> 36:06.764
<i>Disable your weapons
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

36:06.766 --> 36:08.299
Oh, it's good to be home.

36:08.301 --> 36:10.033
<i>Captain Hunter.</i>

36:10.035 --> 36:11.702
<i>This is unexpected.</i>

36:11.704 --> 36:13.737
Well, I have a reputation
to maintain, don't I?

36:13.739 --> 36:15.839
And I hereby request
an immediate assembly

36:15.841 --> 36:17.139
of the Time Council
in accordance

36:17.141 --> 36:18.808
with General Order 52.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.943
<i>So you've returned
to answer for your crimes?</i>

36:20.945 --> 36:23.613
No. I'm here to justify them.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.149
If this truly is good-bye,

36:27.151 --> 36:29.819
would you mind answering
just one final question?

36:29.821 --> 36:31.721
Well,
it seems only sporting.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.956
How did you manage to escape
my prison all those years ago?

36:34.958 --> 36:37.826
There were no signs of damage,

36:37.828 --> 36:39.861
no clues to your tricks.

36:39.863 --> 36:43.532
It left me puzzled
for centuries.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.034
The best magic tricks
have the simplest solutions.

36:46.036 --> 36:48.637
I bribed your guard
with a novelty pen.

36:48.639 --> 36:50.004
Had a picture
of a woman on it.

36:50.006 --> 36:51.639
Turn it upside down,
her top comes off.

36:51.641 --> 36:54.642
I won it from a drunk GI
in a Philippines bar in 1944.

36:54.644 --> 36:56.711
It's a tacky souvenir,

36:56.713 --> 37:00.348
but in this case,
a lifesaver.

37:00.350 --> 37:02.550
Now, unfortunate for you,

37:02.552 --> 37:04.084
the guards
at the Vanishing Point

37:04.086 --> 37:06.821
won't be quite so easily swayed.

37:10.659 --> 37:13.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:13.662 --> 37:17.397
Uh, I was making sure
that he was okay.

37:18.834 --> 37:20.400
I think most guys would be

37:20.402 --> 37:23.636
more inclined
to smother him with a pillow.

37:23.638 --> 37:28.073
Just because he stole my girl
and tried to take over the ship?

37:28.075 --> 37:32.043
But seriously,
Carter saved your life.

37:32.045 --> 37:35.213
He's a part of this team.
Always has been.

37:35.215 --> 37:37.148
I wish things
could be different.

37:37.150 --> 37:39.317
Yeah, me too.

37:39.319 --> 37:41.719
I need you to know
that what we had was real.

37:44.357 --> 37:47.091
In a way,

37:47.093 --> 37:50.862
a broken heart is
just what the doctor ordered.

37:50.864 --> 37:53.364
- It is?
- Yeah.

37:53.366 --> 37:57.167
When I lost Anna,
I thought that...

37:57.169 --> 37:58.935
I could never find anybody
who I could spend

37:58.937 --> 38:01.772
the rest of my life with.

38:01.774 --> 38:04.541
You proved me wrong.

38:04.543 --> 38:07.677
Thank you for showing me
that it's possible.

38:18.055 --> 38:19.655
Rip Hunter,

38:19.657 --> 38:22.725
on behalf of the Time Council,
you are hereby ordered...

38:22.727 --> 38:24.126
Yeah, before you do that,
there's someone

38:24.128 --> 38:25.994
I'd like you to meet.

38:28.666 --> 38:30.533
You remember Mr. Savage?

38:34.704 --> 38:35.737
Of course.

38:35.739 --> 38:37.539
And we remember how you pled

38:37.541 --> 38:41.609
for us to remove him
from the timeline once before.

38:41.611 --> 38:44.211
Well, as the first Time Master
was so fond of saying,

38:44.213 --> 38:46.815
that was then,
this is now.

38:46.817 --> 38:50.016
Incontrovertible proof
that Vandal Savage

38:50.018 --> 38:52.719
has been engaged
in the manipulation of time!

38:52.721 --> 38:54.888
Including a confession.

38:54.890 --> 38:57.190
<i>When I saw you again
in 1975,</i>

38:57.192 --> 39:00.727
<i>I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.</i>

39:00.729 --> 39:02.863
<i>You showed a caveman fire,</i>

39:02.865 --> 39:04.998
<i>and I had almost 200 years</i>

39:05.000 --> 39:07.633
<i>to figure out how
to strike the flame.</i>

39:10.371 --> 39:12.237
Impressive, Captain Hunter.

39:12.239 --> 39:13.873
You and your team
have accomplished

39:13.875 --> 39:15.341
what none of us here

39:15.343 --> 39:18.143
in the Time Council
believed you would.

39:18.145 --> 39:19.979
If the prisoner
would step forward...

39:24.518 --> 39:28.587
Vandal Savage,
by the power of this chamber,

39:28.589 --> 39:33.424
it is my duty to return you
to Earth immediately.

39:35.195 --> 39:36.761
What?

39:36.763 --> 39:38.396
This man you've brought
before us

39:38.398 --> 39:42.032
is needed back in 2166.

39:42.034 --> 39:43.834
You're in league with him.

39:43.836 --> 39:46.770
I wouldn't expect you
to understand our reasons.

39:46.772 --> 39:49.206
For all your wisdom,
you were never able to take

39:49.208 --> 39:51.675
the long view of history.

39:51.677 --> 39:52.677
Take him away.

39:54.580 --> 39:56.847
Search their ship
for the others.

40:05.156 --> 40:08.290
- Did you hear that?
- Don't try to distract me.

40:16.767 --> 40:19.167
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

40:19.169 --> 40:21.369
Why do we need
to find somewhere to hide?

40:21.371 --> 40:23.138
Alexa.

40:32.916 --> 40:36.050
Damn.

40:36.052 --> 40:38.719
Ah, if you're here for Savage,

40:38.721 --> 40:40.320
you're too late.

40:40.322 --> 40:42.590
- Mick, what's going on?
- You're under arrest.

40:42.592 --> 40:45.960
Oh.

40:45.962 --> 40:48.662
If I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

40:52.467 --> 40:54.834
Druce's men
have taken your ship.

40:54.836 --> 40:56.703
Your friends are under arrest.

40:56.705 --> 41:01.140
And you are once again
my prisoner.

41:01.142 --> 41:04.010
This time,
I don't plan to lose you.

41:04.012 --> 41:09.414
Oh, and yes, I do remember
the guard very well.

41:09.416 --> 41:11.784
He died.

41:11.786 --> 41:13.185
Now, if you would excuse me,

41:13.187 --> 41:17.189
I'd better be getting back
to 2166.

41:17.191 --> 41:21.894
I've been waiting so very long
to meet your family.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.194
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

41:23.196 --> 41:27.599
No! No!

41:27.601 --> 41:29.734
No!
