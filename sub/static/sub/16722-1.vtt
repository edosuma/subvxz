00:19.393 --> 00:23.062
Oh! Oh... Uh!

00:23.063 --> 00:24.931
What? (gasps) No!

00:24.932 --> 00:27.167
Lin, you gotta stop reading
the police blotter.

00:27.168 --> 00:28.802
It just makes you mad.

00:28.803 --> 00:31.921
Why would someone steal
the sign for Ball Street?

00:31.922 --> 00:33.273
Oh. (laughs)

00:33.274 --> 00:34.908
Oh, God, what is
this town coming to?

00:34.942 --> 00:37.127
It's going to crap.
Tell me about it.

00:37.128 --> 00:39.245
Somebody threw a snow cone
at my windshield today.

00:39.246 --> 00:40.597
I thought I hit
a rainbow.

00:40.598 --> 00:42.298
It was terrifying.
Oh, come on.

00:42.299 --> 00:45.568
I don't think this town
is going to crap.

00:45.603 --> 00:48.087
(engines roaring)

00:54.945 --> 00:56.479
That's my 2:00.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.814
The One Eyed Snakes
motorcycle club.

00:57.815 --> 00:59.949
Their chapter president
died gruesomely.

00:59.950 --> 01:01.479
I'm doing the service.

01:01.485 --> 01:03.753
That explains why you're
wearing leather pants.

01:03.754 --> 01:06.289
Been waiting forever
to bust these out.

01:06.290 --> 01:07.607
He looks like Prince.

01:07.608 --> 01:09.209
He looks like fat,
white Prince.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.821
MORT:
Look, but don't touch, fellas.

01:10.845 --> 01:13.449
(boy grunting)

01:15.716 --> 01:18.351
Oh, no, these are the guys
who took over the Steps.

01:18.352 --> 01:19.652
I heard they pick
on kids.

01:19.653 --> 01:21.221
Wait. I'm a kid!

01:21.222 --> 01:22.788
Come on.
Let's take the long way.

01:22.789 --> 01:24.641
I'm not afraid
of some high school kids.

01:24.642 --> 01:26.209
Watch a-this.

01:27.461 --> 01:28.728
(humming nonchalantly)

01:28.729 --> 01:30.930
Hey, hey.
You can't walk here.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.177
Oh, my gosh,
I can't walk here?

01:33.200 --> 01:35.387
Oh, look, it's a miracle!
I'm walking!

01:35.402 --> 01:36.970
Shut your butts, coconuts.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.005
But you said I couldn't,
but I'm doing it.

01:39.006 --> 01:40.607
But I want your butt to shut.

01:40.641 --> 01:42.475
Oh, listen to the hum
of my butt. (humming)

01:42.510 --> 01:45.712
Oh, listen to this:
clap, clap shut, clap it shut!

01:45.713 --> 01:46.996
See ya later!

01:46.997 --> 01:48.832
Have a great life!

01:48.833 --> 01:50.319
Oh, already havin' it!

01:50.334 --> 01:52.335
That was intense.
Those guys?

01:52.336 --> 01:54.003
They're just little
acne-covered kittens.

01:54.004 --> 01:55.555
(mimics gunshots)

01:55.556 --> 01:57.785
Meow, meow, meow!
(gunshots) Meow!

01:59.410 --> 02:01.678
â™ª â™ª

02:09.520 --> 02:12.505
This memorial jam has been
going on for 21 minutes.

02:12.506 --> 02:14.841
I just wonder
if I should fade it out.

02:14.842 --> 02:16.559
This was Horny Dave's
favorite jam.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.894
Keep it cranked.

02:17.895 --> 02:19.245
Horny Dave's
favorite jam?

02:19.246 --> 02:20.747
This is <i>my</i> favorite jam.

02:20.748 --> 02:22.059
Keep it cranked,
Eddie!

02:24.552 --> 02:26.719
(bottle breaks)

02:26.720 --> 02:28.855
Oh, God, don't come here,
no, no, no, no.

02:28.856 --> 02:30.874
Welcome!
You serve beer?

02:30.875 --> 02:32.475
We... do not.

02:32.509 --> 02:34.110
What's that?

02:34.111 --> 02:36.713
That is beer.
Sorry, we do. I lied.

02:36.714 --> 02:38.498
Let's drink to Horny Dave.

02:38.532 --> 02:40.250
To Horny Dave!

02:42.469 --> 02:44.748
What are you talking about?

02:45.890 --> 02:47.574
Yeah! (laughs)

02:47.575 --> 02:50.209
Um, the woman who won
that drinking contest,

02:50.210 --> 02:51.377
she's pregnant, right?

02:51.378 --> 02:52.845
Well, they say
in moderation.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.931
Hey, man, they don't judge
your lifestyle,

02:54.932 --> 02:57.233
you buttoned-down pencil pusher.
What?

02:57.234 --> 02:58.968
Sorry, Bobby, this motorcycle
thing's contagious.

02:58.969 --> 03:01.371
I kinda want to go out
and get a bike tonight.

03:01.372 --> 03:02.722
Hassle shopkeepers.
"Hey, old man!" You know?

03:02.723 --> 03:04.240
"You don't know me.

03:04.241 --> 03:06.409
I'll break your window
and hit ya with a bat."

03:06.410 --> 03:07.944
Sounds like a
great idea, Teddy.

03:07.945 --> 03:09.078
Ah, maybe not.

03:09.079 --> 03:10.480
Probably just watch
a hockey game.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.282
To Horny Dave! A helluva man!

03:12.283 --> 03:13.566
A helluva friend!

03:13.567 --> 03:14.612
A helluva lover!

03:17.338 --> 03:18.955
Uh, they broke more bottles.

03:20.591 --> 03:23.259
Whoa, looks like our restaurant just
got a lot edgier.

03:23.260 --> 03:24.661
Hope I can
still get in.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.062
You probably can't.

03:26.063 --> 03:27.416
I'll meet you
guys after.

03:27.431 --> 03:29.098
I like your lid.

03:29.099 --> 03:31.200
I like your vest...
what's left of it.

03:31.235 --> 03:33.236
Yep, these colors have been
to hell and back.

03:33.237 --> 03:34.537
Part of 'em
stayed in hell.

03:34.571 --> 03:35.972
What are those pretty buttons?

03:36.006 --> 03:37.674
Oh, these patches?

03:37.675 --> 03:40.638
Well, we got this one
for... tickling a cop.

03:40.644 --> 03:42.378
Cool! What's that one for?

03:42.413 --> 03:45.893
For not being associated
with the white power movement.

03:45.916 --> 03:47.227
And what's that one for?

03:47.251 --> 03:49.352
For blowing up a bunch...

03:49.353 --> 03:50.787
of balloons...

03:50.788 --> 03:52.104
for kids like you.

03:52.105 --> 03:53.539
Just an ordinary day

03:53.540 --> 03:55.986
here at Bob's Burgers,
right, kids?

03:56.010 --> 03:57.777
Nice place.
I'm Critter, by the way.

03:57.778 --> 03:59.512
Uh, Bob.

03:59.513 --> 04:01.497
Yeah, I'm the, uh, chapter
president of these fellas.

04:01.498 --> 04:03.800
Horny Dave was,
till his grisly death.

04:03.801 --> 04:05.735
Well, I'm sure you don't want
to talk about it, so...

04:05.736 --> 04:07.770
Yeah, he got into a wreck
with a semi, all right.

04:07.771 --> 04:09.072
Real fiery.
Mm-hmm.

04:09.073 --> 04:10.907
By the time they pulled him out,

04:10.908 --> 04:12.975
his entire lower half,
the horny half, was roasted.

04:12.976 --> 04:14.880
That's why Horny Dave's
vest here is in tatters.

04:14.912 --> 04:16.279
Um, it looks nice.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.047
No, it doesn't, Bob.
No, it doesn't.

04:18.048 --> 04:19.665
This vest is supposed
to make me look

04:19.666 --> 04:21.567
like the unquestioned
leader of this club,

04:21.567 --> 04:23.136
but instead I, I just look foolish.
Mm.

04:23.170 --> 04:26.789
Whoa! Statch! Nasty Slim!
Cool it!

04:26.824 --> 04:29.909
See? Horny Dave was just a better leader.
If we were fighting,

04:29.910 --> 04:32.261
he'd come out and he'd say,
"Let's go cook some meth!"

04:32.262 --> 04:34.230
And we would, and we'd forget
all our troubles.

04:34.231 --> 04:35.581
That sounds nice.

04:35.582 --> 04:36.916
Maybe we should
cook meth.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.451
I wanna forget
my troubles.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.752
God bless this meth.

04:39.753 --> 04:41.320
Kids, go inside.

04:41.321 --> 04:43.322
So, uh, that's
your old lady, huh?

04:43.357 --> 04:45.291
Uh, yeah.
She goes by "Linda."

04:45.292 --> 04:47.660
Or Dragon.
Whichever.

04:47.661 --> 04:49.095
So is that
your old lady?

04:49.129 --> 04:51.280
No, Mudflap was
Horny Dave's.

04:51.315 --> 04:52.482
She's a special woman.

04:52.483 --> 04:53.983
She can open a beer
with her boobs.

04:53.984 --> 04:55.768
Mine can't do that.
It's an art.

04:55.769 --> 04:57.837
TINA: Whoa!
Ha-ha!

04:57.871 --> 04:59.155
BOB:
Oh, my!

04:59.156 --> 05:00.634
Mm-hmm. Thank you.
Thank you.

05:00.657 --> 05:02.175
Now I want them.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.943
Is that a requirement
for being in the club?

05:03.977 --> 05:07.029
Wish it was that easy.
Initiation was tough.

05:07.030 --> 05:09.682
Mudflap beat the snot out of
some poser in Macon, Georgia

05:09.683 --> 05:11.334
one fine day in spring.

05:11.335 --> 05:12.768
Got her colors that night.

05:12.769 --> 05:14.320
It was fall.
It was spring.

05:14.321 --> 05:16.189
I remember because
the azaleas were in bloom.

05:16.223 --> 05:18.141
Ooh, azaleas.

05:18.142 --> 05:20.143
Oh, the azaleas <i>are</i>
beautiful in Macon.

05:20.144 --> 05:21.344
Second only
to their crank.

05:21.345 --> 05:23.657
That sweet Macon crank.
Oh.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.815
What's crank?
Like meth's dirty cousin.

05:25.849 --> 05:27.700
Oh, we're gonna
cook meth.

05:27.701 --> 05:29.068
Oh... ha-ha.

05:29.069 --> 05:30.670
Okay, time for bed,
sweeties. Come on.

05:30.671 --> 05:33.139
Can I bring a biker with me
to tell me stories?

05:33.140 --> 05:34.340
No, you may not.

05:34.341 --> 05:35.825
Please...?

05:35.826 --> 05:37.076
Just one!
No.

05:37.077 --> 05:38.861
All right, everybody.

05:38.912 --> 05:41.347
We drank the place dry.
Let's ride!

05:41.348 --> 05:43.316
BIKER: Come on, lil' sweetheart.
Jump on back.

05:43.317 --> 05:45.218
I'm sure they have
designated drivers, so...

05:45.219 --> 05:47.053
This should cover
the damage.

05:47.054 --> 05:49.021
Sorry there's blood
on some of it.

05:49.022 --> 05:51.824
Huh. Oh...

05:51.825 --> 05:53.426
Oh, one last thing. Here.

05:53.427 --> 05:54.527
What's this?

05:54.528 --> 05:56.162
Means we owe you one.

05:56.163 --> 05:58.064
Put it in your window.
Nobody will mess with you.

05:58.065 --> 05:59.498
Uh, except maybe
the Buzzard Kings.

05:59.499 --> 06:01.067
They might throw
a Molotov cocktail in here.

06:01.068 --> 06:02.435
You call me if they do.

06:02.436 --> 06:04.904
Uh! No, no. Right in the window.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.611
So, we've got this now.

06:11.612 --> 06:13.916
GENE: Uh-oh, we're
crossing paths again.

06:13.947 --> 06:15.047
We're crossing paths!

06:15.048 --> 06:16.282
Hey, remember
when I told you

06:16.283 --> 06:17.750
not to come around here?

06:17.784 --> 06:19.752
Guess not.
I'm not so good with history.

06:19.753 --> 06:20.853
Me, neither!

06:20.854 --> 06:22.121
I'm pretty good at history,

06:22.122 --> 06:23.589
but I have some problems
with math.

06:23.624 --> 06:25.725
Well, I'm taking
a course in the future.

06:25.726 --> 06:27.226
You know what happens
in the future?

06:27.227 --> 06:28.594
We walk right past you.

06:28.629 --> 06:30.930
Uh! I just want no little kids
around me

06:30.931 --> 06:32.465
when I'm decompressing
after school.

06:32.466 --> 06:34.300
I'm trying to create
a relaxed environment,

06:34.301 --> 06:35.918
I'm making my friends
feel comfortable,

06:35.919 --> 06:38.421
and then you come by
with all ts attitude!

06:38.455 --> 06:40.389
Hey, you don't want to
mess with my sister.

06:40.390 --> 06:41.857
She'll wear down
your self-esteem

06:41.858 --> 06:43.392
over a period
of years.

06:43.393 --> 06:44.760
Mm-hmm. Shut up, four-eyes.
Oh.

06:44.761 --> 06:47.213
I'm talkin' to four-ears.

06:47.214 --> 06:50.215
With four ears, I can
ignore you twice as hard.

06:50.216 --> 06:51.817
What, what? What, what?

06:51.818 --> 06:54.237
You've pushed me
to the point of break.

06:54.238 --> 06:55.738
I'm confiscating these.

06:55.739 --> 06:57.907
(Louise screams)
(both gasp)

06:57.908 --> 07:00.126
Laters!

07:01.778 --> 07:03.996
What just friggin' happened?!

07:10.403 --> 07:12.701
So, I couldn't
help notice

07:12.702 --> 07:14.703
someone doesn't have
their bunny ears on.

07:14.737 --> 07:16.204
Ha-ha! I know, right?

07:16.205 --> 07:18.256
It's, uh, been
a pretty long time

07:18.257 --> 07:20.191
since we've seen you without your...
Too long!

07:20.192 --> 07:21.426
Too... long!

07:21.427 --> 07:23.228
Okay.

07:23.229 --> 07:25.430
Louise, maybe you'd feel better
if you told Mom and Dad...

07:25.464 --> 07:26.798
How happy I am?

07:26.799 --> 07:28.433
Mom, up high.
Hey! Oh!

07:28.467 --> 07:30.101
I'll take one.
You got it, bro!

07:30.136 --> 07:31.469
Whoo!

07:31.470 --> 07:33.271
Whew. Oh. Geez.

07:33.272 --> 07:35.874
Do you think I should
go talk to her, Bobby?

07:35.875 --> 07:37.375
No, you shouldn't!

07:37.376 --> 07:38.743
I'm great!
Just fantastic!

07:38.744 --> 07:40.645
(door slams)
Uh, maybe wait.

07:40.646 --> 07:42.087
(school bell rings)

07:42.114 --> 07:44.215
You're not wearing
your ears today.

07:44.216 --> 07:45.750
Or are they invisible?

07:45.751 --> 07:47.385
Ha-ha-ha!
Invisible?!

07:47.386 --> 07:49.721
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

07:49.722 --> 07:53.058
Your mind
is so beautiful!

07:55.744 --> 07:57.145
Yeah, take it in!

07:57.146 --> 08:00.115
Whoa, Louise, not wearing
your bunny ears?

08:00.149 --> 08:01.666
This is big.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.735
Lots of issues to discuss,
feelings to process.

08:03.736 --> 08:06.004
Oh, yeah, tell me
about it, Mr. Frond!

08:06.005 --> 08:07.856
I am processing up a storm,

08:07.857 --> 08:10.775
but I could really use
a processing-partner!

08:10.776 --> 08:13.428
Me?!
Great idea! Your office?

08:13.429 --> 08:15.296
Five minutes?
Yeah!

08:15.331 --> 08:16.664
I'm out of here.

08:16.665 --> 08:18.266
I'm gonna wait
for that punk at the Steps

08:18.267 --> 08:19.534
and get my ears back.

08:19.535 --> 08:20.935
We'll come with you.

08:20.936 --> 08:23.471
No. You guys go home
and lie to Mom and Dad.

08:23.472 --> 08:25.140
Good. I'm a liar,
not a fighter.

08:25.174 --> 08:26.924
Louise, wait.
What?

08:26.942 --> 08:28.910
You want us
to keep your dinner warm?

08:28.944 --> 08:31.162
Yeah. <i>Real</i> warm.

08:33.032 --> 08:36.150
Hello, I see you're wearing
my ears. Oh, they're

08:36.152 --> 08:37.352
off-center
a smidge.

08:37.352 --> 08:38.503
Let me just...
(shrieks)

08:38.554 --> 08:40.587
Nice try, kid.

08:40.623 --> 08:42.690
Fine. We're all young
professionals here.

08:42.691 --> 08:45.609
I'm Louise, by the way.
I-I don't think I got your name.

08:45.610 --> 08:46.661
Logan.

08:46.662 --> 08:47.996
<i>Logan...</i>

08:47.997 --> 08:49.364
what's this in my pocket?

08:49.365 --> 08:51.966
Oh, one, two,
three, four, five, six,

08:51.967 --> 08:53.685
seven, eight, nine dollars
for the hat.

08:53.719 --> 08:56.638
You can't buy me
like a cheap sex lady!

08:56.639 --> 08:58.139
(yells)

08:58.140 --> 09:00.141
(chuckles)
Too slow, down low.

09:00.142 --> 09:01.709
Why don't you go back
to plan-school

09:01.710 --> 09:03.545
because looks like you
need a better one.

09:03.579 --> 09:05.646
Why don't you go
to plan-school?!

09:05.664 --> 09:07.282
Why don't you?
Why don't you?

09:07.316 --> 09:09.334
No, you, why don't you?
Why don't you?!

09:09.335 --> 09:10.585
No, why don't you?
Why don't you?!

09:11.887 --> 09:13.488
What do we do
with this card?

09:13.489 --> 09:14.823
Take it down?
It's creepy.

09:14.824 --> 09:16.357
Are you crazy?

09:16.358 --> 09:18.026
Remember when you
took down that charity jar?

09:18.027 --> 09:20.395
You saw how pissed those
breast cancer people got.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.163
Hey, parentals.
Where's Louise?

09:22.198 --> 09:24.365
Um...
Hat shopping?

09:24.366 --> 09:25.667
Shopping for hats.

09:25.668 --> 09:27.035
Huh, that makes sense.

09:27.036 --> 09:28.603
I guess Louise needs
to transition

09:28.604 --> 09:30.238
from bunny ears to something.

09:30.239 --> 09:32.774
Like training wheels.
Like when we got a fish for Gene

09:32.775 --> 09:35.043
to prove he was responsible
enough to get a dog.

09:35.044 --> 09:37.045
I was not.
That poor fish.

09:38.247 --> 09:40.014
So, where are we going?

09:40.015 --> 09:42.000
My calendar is
wide open.

09:42.034 --> 09:44.452
Yeah, well, uh,
I'm home now.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.054
So, run along,
little doggie.

09:46.088 --> 09:47.555
No, <i>we're</i> home now.

09:47.556 --> 09:49.257
Until I get those
ears back,

09:49.291 --> 09:51.793
wherever you go,
I go.

09:55.231 --> 09:57.398
Going to school, Logan?
I'll join you.

09:57.433 --> 09:58.733
Let's do it.

09:58.734 --> 10:00.301
(yells)
Nope.

10:00.302 --> 10:03.071
Logan, Logan, Logan, Logan.
What do you do?

10:03.072 --> 10:05.173
You go to your locker
before you go to class

10:05.207 --> 10:06.374
or you go to class?
Gotta pee?

10:06.375 --> 10:07.742
What's the routine here?

10:07.743 --> 10:09.811
You know, I could pee...
in the boys' room.

10:09.812 --> 10:11.646
Well, you think
I won't go in there?

10:11.647 --> 10:12.780
I'm not giving up, Logan.

10:12.781 --> 10:14.182
I will wear you down.

10:14.216 --> 10:16.434
I got a prom date
because of these ears.

10:16.435 --> 10:18.319
My practice S.A.T. scores
went up.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.921
I'm not giving up, either.

10:21.590 --> 10:22.924
Whoo!
It stinks in here.

10:22.925 --> 10:24.916
Welcome
to boys' smell.

10:36.155 --> 10:38.056
Logan! I like
your bunny ears.

10:38.057 --> 10:39.424
Thanks, Shanaya.

10:39.425 --> 10:43.261
LOUISE: They're not his ears!
(yells)

10:43.295 --> 10:46.431
Oh, sorry you had
to leave so soon!

10:46.432 --> 10:50.018
Let the record show that I tried
to reason with you, Logan!

10:50.019 --> 10:52.194
Now I have to go nuclear!

10:53.606 --> 10:54.806
Can I help you?

10:54.840 --> 10:56.474
I hope I'm not interrupting

10:56.475 --> 10:58.643
dinner, ma'am,
but your son... (sighs)

10:58.644 --> 11:00.478
he stole something of mine.

11:00.512 --> 11:01.946
Logan!

11:01.947 --> 11:04.148
You took this girl's bunny ears?

11:04.149 --> 11:07.168
I didn't want to tattle,
but you left me no choice.

11:07.202 --> 11:08.620
Yeah. I took 'em.

11:08.621 --> 11:10.939
Return them. Now.
I threw 'em away.

11:10.940 --> 11:12.273
I told you you'd
never get 'em back.

11:12.308 --> 11:14.841
Bull, you threw them away.
Search my room.

11:14.860 --> 11:16.311
Ugh, Logan.

11:16.312 --> 11:18.630
Sorry, I'll write you a check.
$20?

11:18.631 --> 11:19.981
0 seems a bit high, honey.

11:19.982 --> 11:21.349
Oh, God, Tom. Not now!

11:21.383 --> 11:23.484
Where did you throw them away?

11:23.519 --> 11:24.953
Pancho's Tacos.

11:24.954 --> 11:27.338
Which one, Logan?
It's a chain!

11:27.373 --> 11:29.324
The good one.
The one on Riverside.

11:44.556 --> 11:46.574
Uh, kid, what you're
looking for was incinerated.

11:46.575 --> 11:47.825
It's gone.

11:47.826 --> 11:49.877
Pfft. Burned up. Sorry.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.548
No!

11:53.582 --> 11:56.017
(sobbing)

11:57.419 --> 11:59.837
(laughing crazily)

12:01.674 --> 12:03.508
Revenge.

12:03.509 --> 12:05.326
Is this it?
No!

12:05.327 --> 12:06.928
Are these it?
It's pink with ears.

12:06.929 --> 12:08.262
Oh, then they're gone.
It's a hat.

12:08.263 --> 12:09.995
No. Then they're gone.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.241
Hey, I remember this hat.

12:14.242 --> 12:15.709
It was gonna be my thing.
Remember?

12:15.743 --> 12:17.160
I could pull this off. Right?

12:17.161 --> 12:20.030
Um... yeah,
of course you can!

12:20.031 --> 12:22.299
There she is,
my little big girl.

12:22.333 --> 12:23.850
Tina and Gene told us

12:23.851 --> 12:25.519
you were in the market
for an in-between hat,

12:25.520 --> 12:27.153
so we dug some
out of the closet.

12:27.154 --> 12:28.488
Maybe not this one.

12:28.489 --> 12:29.706
You probably
don't want this one.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.174
How thoughtful of you all,

12:31.175 --> 12:33.594
but I don't need a hat
to complete me.

12:33.595 --> 12:36.063
I'm all I need.
Just me.

12:36.097 --> 12:37.531
That's what I keep telling you.

12:37.532 --> 12:38.765
Good night, Linda.

12:38.766 --> 12:40.334
Thank you for
thinking about me.

12:40.335 --> 12:41.535
You're welcome.

12:41.569 --> 12:43.070
All I need is that hat!

12:43.071 --> 12:45.171
Mine!

12:46.357 --> 12:48.342
LOGAN:
Look who it is.

12:48.343 --> 12:50.527
Surprised you don't have pig
ears on, the way you squeal.

12:50.528 --> 12:51.728
(laughs)

12:51.763 --> 12:53.230
Ha! Ha! Ha!

12:53.231 --> 12:54.865
Question.
How's your hearing?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.667
Uh, pretty good. Why?

12:56.701 --> 12:58.435
Well, then I guess
you can hear that.

12:58.436 --> 12:59.703
(motorcycles rumbling)

13:01.773 --> 13:03.874
That's the sound of revenge.

13:03.875 --> 13:05.125
Uh...

13:08.029 --> 13:10.380
For taking that
which wasn't yours,

13:10.415 --> 13:13.199
I have summoned the wrath
of the One Eyed Snakes!

13:13.200 --> 13:15.886
Hell hath no fury like...

13:16.904 --> 13:19.373
Kill the bikes for a second!

13:21.442 --> 13:22.693
Thank you.

13:22.694 --> 13:24.394
Hell hath no fury...

13:24.395 --> 13:26.430
Did you hear that part? About hell?
Yeah, I think so.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.231
Good.
'Cause the rest of it is,

13:28.266 --> 13:32.753
"Hell hath no fury
like I do, Logan!"

13:32.754 --> 13:34.454
You took my ears
and threw them away.

13:34.455 --> 13:36.056
And now these guys

13:36.057 --> 13:38.759
are going to take your
ears and throw them away.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.495
What?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.081
Oh, boy.

13:44.082 --> 13:45.649
I'm going to watch
through my fingers.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.317
No, I'm not.
I'm going to look away.

13:47.318 --> 13:48.785
I think we're gonna
have to lay low

13:48.786 --> 13:49.920
for a little while
after this.

13:49.921 --> 13:52.756
Oh, God, don't cut my ears off!

13:52.757 --> 13:54.558
Ha! Ho!

13:54.559 --> 13:56.927
I hate when shirt tags stick out.
Here, here, here, here!

13:56.961 --> 13:58.762
I never threw them out, okay?

13:58.763 --> 14:00.447
(crying):
I'm so sorry!

14:00.448 --> 14:02.115
M-My ears.

14:07.739 --> 14:10.123
Please don't
cut off my ears!

14:10.124 --> 14:11.525
Leave 'em where they are.

14:11.526 --> 14:13.276
They... they look good
in that position.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.578
Can I look yet?

14:14.579 --> 14:16.079
Nee-ya...
I'll let you know.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.115
My hands smell like onions.
It's nice.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.283
Don't ever mess
with us again, Logan.

14:20.284 --> 14:22.285
Now, get the hell outta here!
Ah!

14:22.320 --> 14:24.004
Yeah! That's how you do it!

14:24.038 --> 14:25.806
That's how you do it!

14:28.701 --> 14:30.961
(motorcycle rumbles)

14:30.962 --> 14:34.498
No, no, no, no, we just got
the place back together.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.950
(engines rumbling,
bikers laughing, talking)

14:39.787 --> 14:42.255
Welcome back, fellas.
How are you?

14:42.290 --> 14:43.657
LINDA:
Kids?

14:43.691 --> 14:45.058
What's going on?

14:45.059 --> 14:46.209
Louise, you're wearing
your ears again.

14:46.210 --> 14:47.644
Yeah, some kids stole 'em

14:47.645 --> 14:49.196
and these mamma-jammas
got 'em back!

14:49.197 --> 14:52.682
Mamma-jammas, what?
Your ears were stolen?

14:52.717 --> 14:55.118
Yup. I cashed in the card
the One Eyed Snakes gave us.

14:55.153 --> 14:56.987
Good to see you again, Bob.
Nice hat.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.822
Ah, really?
Yeah, you think so?

14:58.856 --> 15:01.191
Oh, and I told them food
and drinks are on the house.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.426
No. They... that's... No.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.693
I don't think that's...

15:03.694 --> 15:05.062
Ya hear that, boys? Go crazy!

15:05.063 --> 15:06.897
All right! Yay!
No. No. No, no, no.

15:06.898 --> 15:08.198
All right,
let's go crazy.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.666
Please don't go crazy.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.052
(talking, laughing)

15:13.254 --> 15:14.704
Um, can I help you folks?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.006
Yes.

15:16.007 --> 15:17.674
We are parents
in this community,

15:17.675 --> 15:20.077
and we're marching on your
filthy, dangerous biker bar.

15:20.078 --> 15:21.478
We're not a biker bar.

15:21.479 --> 15:23.997
You are serving beer
to a ton of bikers.

15:24.031 --> 15:25.732
Tom, please.

15:25.733 --> 15:28.318
This biker bar is the reason our
town is going down the tubes.

15:28.352 --> 15:30.087
And we will not allow

15:30.088 --> 15:32.155
violence against our
children to continue.

15:32.156 --> 15:33.390
Violence!

15:33.391 --> 15:34.708
Violence? What violence?

15:34.742 --> 15:38.328
Those bikers wanted
to cut off my ears.

15:38.362 --> 15:39.896
Oh, God.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.865
Ah, calm down, we weren't
gonna cut off any ears.

15:41.866 --> 15:43.350
Don't listen to him.
He would have.

15:43.351 --> 15:45.202
No, I wouldn't.
Yeah, you would.

15:45.203 --> 15:46.736
I'm tellin' ya, I would not...
I think you would have.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.572
You don't know my mind!

15:48.606 --> 15:51.508
You see, I was just teachin'
these little bullies a lesson.

15:51.509 --> 15:54.211
So this is the brat who
picked on my Louise, huh?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.712
Let me tell you something,
Miss Priss.

15:55.713 --> 15:57.581
Lin...
No. I got this.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.717
These bikers aren't the problem
in this town; it's your kids.

16:00.718 --> 16:01.952
They're a bunch of animals.

16:01.953 --> 16:03.753
Yeah, lady!
Control your kids.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.389
Oh, it is your kids
who cannot be controlled.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.176
She's right.
I'm out of control.

16:08.192 --> 16:10.327
Oh, why don't you go
fart in a phone booth!

16:10.361 --> 16:11.628
(making fart noises)

16:11.629 --> 16:12.946
All right,
Lin, calm down.

16:12.947 --> 16:14.764
You tell this hussy
to calm down.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.082
Yeah, calm it, hussy!

16:16.083 --> 16:17.951
Do not call my wife a whore.

16:17.952 --> 16:19.753
Oh, I will not calm it.

16:19.787 --> 16:21.238
(grunts)
BIKER: Love a catfight.

16:21.239 --> 16:22.606
Ah!
Ooh.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.241
(grunting)

16:24.242 --> 16:25.492
Lin, stop...
Ah!

16:25.493 --> 16:26.743
Don't do this...
Ooh...

16:26.744 --> 16:27.844
Pull out her highlights, Mom.

16:27.879 --> 16:29.112
All right, all right,

16:29.113 --> 16:31.231
everybody just calm down.
Ah!

16:31.265 --> 16:33.233
(gasping, murmuring)

16:39.757 --> 16:42.826
Pick that up,
apologize and leave.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.461
Please.
For your own good.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.798
I will do no such thing.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.766
Shoulda left when
you coulda left.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.685
Everyone who's got
a knife, grab it!

16:51.686 --> 16:53.760
It's a fight to the death!

16:55.947 --> 16:58.599
(murmuring)

16:58.633 --> 17:00.467
Hey, hey, you can't fight
these people, Critter.

17:00.468 --> 17:02.269
You'll... you'll
destroy them.

17:02.303 --> 17:04.538
When somebody messes with
the One Eyed Snake's colors,

17:04.539 --> 17:05.672
they gotta pay.

17:05.673 --> 17:07.207
My leadership's on the line.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.309
I got no choice...
we gotta hurt these people.

17:09.344 --> 17:10.711
Would Horny Dave have his men

17:10.712 --> 17:12.311
beat up some
white collar parents?

17:12.347 --> 17:14.882
Horny Dave is dead.

17:14.883 --> 17:16.849
All right, it's goin' on now,
here it goes.

17:16.851 --> 17:18.117
They're just bluffing.

17:18.118 --> 17:19.953
The One Eyed Snakes
don't bluff.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.288
Neither do the Belcher kids!

17:21.289 --> 17:22.522
Except when we do.

17:22.523 --> 17:23.773
Yeah! Let's keep shouting stuff!

17:23.775 --> 17:25.127
Screw inside voices!

17:25.143 --> 17:27.172
Okay, I'm calling
the police.

17:27.178 --> 17:29.129
TOM:
No!

17:29.130 --> 17:30.297
My running mix!

17:30.298 --> 17:32.165
Oh, enough talk. Let's kick...

17:32.166 --> 17:33.550
(groans)

17:33.551 --> 17:35.118
Mudflap, are you okay?

17:35.119 --> 17:36.854
I'm fine, it was just
a contraction. Let's...

17:36.855 --> 17:39.022
(groans)
Contraction?

17:39.023 --> 17:41.391
You're in labor?

17:41.392 --> 17:43.493
Hold that kid in till we're done!
I'll try.

17:43.528 --> 17:45.329
(groaning):
No, I can't.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.664
This baby's coming.
Oh, this baby's coming.

17:47.699 --> 17:50.217
I'll call an ambulance.
I'm a doctor.

17:50.218 --> 17:52.085
Well, then get the hell over here!
All right.

17:52.086 --> 17:53.537
Get under the hood
and check the oil, Doc.

17:53.538 --> 17:54.838
(groans)

17:54.839 --> 17:56.240
Okay. Okay, okay.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.075
Uh, how far apart
are the contractions?

17:58.076 --> 18:01.345
They are not.
Oh! Wow. Okay.

18:01.346 --> 18:02.579
This baby is coming now.

18:02.580 --> 18:03.914
Like right into my hand.

18:03.915 --> 18:05.148
Hang in there,
Mudflap, hang in there.

18:05.183 --> 18:06.850
Don't forget to breathe.

18:06.851 --> 18:08.518
Do you want me to get you
a wooden spoon to bite on?

18:08.553 --> 18:10.721
Oh, forget the spoon.
Get me whiskey.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.089
Um, I'm not sure whiskey is...

18:12.090 --> 18:13.523
I have a flask
in my golf bag.

18:13.558 --> 18:14.825
Yeah, I got one here,
somewhere...

18:14.826 --> 18:16.894
I got some whip-its.
Here. Take mine.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.528
Hold on a sec.

18:19.714 --> 18:20.948
Okay, you're doing great.

18:20.949 --> 18:22.215
Uh, what's your name?

18:22.216 --> 18:23.767
Mudflap.
Oh, Mudflap, uh...

18:23.768 --> 18:25.035
that was my
grandmother's name.

18:25.036 --> 18:26.887
Really?
No, no.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.755
You're named after
a dirty part of a truck.

18:28.756 --> 18:30.023
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay, keep breathing.

18:30.058 --> 18:31.236
Okay.
And...

18:31.259 --> 18:33.560
ready... push!

18:33.595 --> 18:35.195
Ugh.
Just pretend it's lasagna.

18:35.229 --> 18:37.064
(Mudflap groans)

18:37.065 --> 18:39.066
I don't know how Mudflap's doing this
without an epidura

18:39.067 --> 18:40.467
If I didn't have
one with Logan?

18:40.468 --> 18:42.369
Whoo!
Ugh, tell me about it.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.037
Those two?
Piece of cake.

18:44.072 --> 18:45.542
That one?
A whole cake.

18:45.573 --> 18:48.241
I'm sorry my Logan
picked on your kids.

18:48.242 --> 18:49.743
Hey. I'm sorry my kids

18:49.744 --> 18:51.881
had bikers threaten to
cut your kid's ears off.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.780
I need you guys to hold up
her knees, just like this...

18:53.781 --> 18:55.616
Okay. I see the head.

18:55.617 --> 18:57.250
(Mudflap groans) Oh, I looked.
That's a head.

18:57.251 --> 18:58.552
I hope that's a head.

18:58.553 --> 18:59.753
I shouldn't have looked.
I looked.

18:59.787 --> 19:01.622
One more big push, Mudflap!

19:01.656 --> 19:02.923
Okay!

19:02.924 --> 19:05.058
(groans)
Here it comes!

19:05.093 --> 19:06.994
(groans)

19:06.995 --> 19:09.129
(baby crying)
ALL: Aw.

19:09.130 --> 19:11.431
CRITTER: Look at that.
"Not it" to clean the table.

19:11.432 --> 19:13.200
It's a boy.
Barely.

19:13.234 --> 19:15.802
Mudflap, is there someone
you'd like to cut the cord?

19:15.803 --> 19:17.738
His daddy.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.206
But Horny Dave's dead.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.676
No, Critter, Horny Dave
had a vasectomy in '95.

19:22.677 --> 19:25.312
Come here.
What are you saying, woman?

19:25.346 --> 19:26.747
This baby's yours.

19:26.781 --> 19:28.115
I still don't understand.

19:28.149 --> 19:31.952
Critter, we had sex
and you knocked me up...

19:31.953 --> 19:33.787
Slow down! Slow down!

19:33.788 --> 19:35.956
This baby is your spawn.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.774
Oh...

19:37.775 --> 19:39.276
Wait a minute,
what do you mean?

19:39.277 --> 19:41.028
(sniffs)
You're a daddy.

19:41.029 --> 19:42.462
From when?

19:42.463 --> 19:44.648
Sometimes the one
you slept with nine months ago

19:44.649 --> 19:46.633
was right in front
of you all along.

19:46.634 --> 19:48.468
Oh, Mudflap.

19:48.469 --> 19:49.886
Give me that cord.

19:49.921 --> 19:51.288
(people exclaiming)

19:51.289 --> 19:53.423
Okay, are we gonna
have the fight now?

19:53.424 --> 19:56.143
Or...
Louise, there's gonna be no fight.

19:56.144 --> 19:59.596
This little kid squashed a beef
better than Horny Dave ever did.

19:59.597 --> 20:01.331
My boy. How 'bout that?

20:01.366 --> 20:02.599
Here, Creature.

20:02.633 --> 20:04.034
Critter.
Right.

20:04.035 --> 20:05.635
Maybe you could use it
as a baby blanket.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.137
Oh. Thank you.

20:07.171 --> 20:09.790
And thanks for getting
your hands dirty, Doc.

20:09.824 --> 20:11.058
No problem.

20:11.059 --> 20:12.843
Aw. Parents helping bikers

20:12.894 --> 20:14.344
who are now parents.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.296
See, our town has its problems.

20:16.297 --> 20:17.481
But it doesn't mean

20:17.515 --> 20:19.016
it's going in the crapper.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.137
It just means if we want
to be a better neighborhood,

20:21.152 --> 20:24.221
we have to be better
neighbors to each other.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.756
Boo!
Boo!

20:25.790 --> 20:27.074
Stinks!
Okay, Louise, come on.

20:27.075 --> 20:28.308
Thanks a lot.
It's okay.

20:28.342 --> 20:29.676
You were very brave.

20:29.677 --> 20:31.078
You stood up
for yourself,

20:31.079 --> 20:32.979
got help from
dangerous bikers,

20:32.980 --> 20:34.481
all without your ears.

20:34.482 --> 20:36.166
Maybe you don't
need them anymore.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.667
Maybe.

20:37.668 --> 20:40.237
And maybe I know someone
who needs them more than m

20:40.238 --> 20:43.423
Look, these ears mean
a lot to you, Logan,

20:43.424 --> 20:45.325
so how about you keep 'em?

20:45.326 --> 20:47.661
Really?
No friggin' way!

20:47.662 --> 20:49.663
I was just messing
with you, you idiot!

20:49.664 --> 20:51.214
Ah! Oh!

20:51.215 --> 20:53.550
Welcome home, ears.
Let's get you a beer.

20:53.584 --> 20:55.018
Dad, two beers.
No.

20:55.019 --> 20:56.741
They're for my ears!
