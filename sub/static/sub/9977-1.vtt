02:31.534 --> 02:34.697
<i>In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson...</i>

02:34.771 --> 02:37.501
<i>commissioned Meriwether Lewis
and William Clark...</i>

02:37.574 --> 02:41.442
<i>to explore the vast,
uncharted territories of the Northwest.</i>

02:41.778 --> 02:45.179
<i>What most people don't know
is that there was a second expedition...</i>

02:45.248 --> 02:47.045
<i>led by two other men...</i>

02:47.116 --> 02:49.277
<i>men that may not have
possessed the courage...</i>

02:49.352 --> 02:51.980
<i>vision, or intelligence of Lewis and Clark...</i>

02:52.055 --> 02:54.250
<i>but men nonetheless.</i>

02:54.624 --> 02:58.560
<i>Their story, such as it is,
begins in Arlington, Virginia.</i>

03:16.412 --> 03:21.145
It'll take more than a couple of fops
to take me down!

03:23.386 --> 03:27.720
I hope Satan himself burns the flesh
from your miserable bones!

03:27.991 --> 03:29.982
Good God, lady!

03:30.827 --> 03:33.921
Get your hands off me!

03:35.131 --> 03:36.655
Leave me alone!

03:53.349 --> 03:56.648
Faster, man. Faster. But not too fast.

03:57.387 --> 04:01.050
As much haste as possible while
maintaining a tolerable level of comfort.

04:01.124 --> 04:03.115
A man's life is at stake.

04:03.192 --> 04:04.181
No!

04:04.861 --> 04:08.092
On March 25, 1804...

04:08.531 --> 04:10.192
Bartholomew Hunt...

04:10.566 --> 04:14.468
a tracker employed by the army
of the United States of America...

04:14.537 --> 04:17.062
was found guiIty of drunken
and disorderly conduct...

04:17.140 --> 04:19.267
in the presence of an officer.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.434
Then later...

04:20.510 --> 04:24.742
he forced that officer to waItz with him
through a crowded mess hall.

04:29.953 --> 04:31.944
Have you anything to say?

04:32.455 --> 04:34.082
Yes, I do.

04:35.058 --> 04:39.256
When I am dead
and have passed on to the next world...

04:39.329 --> 04:42.856
I want you to lower me
from these gallows and...

04:43.499 --> 04:46.195
kiss my hairy buttocks!

04:46.369 --> 04:47.631
Hang him !

04:50.707 --> 04:52.834
Take him down and choke him !

04:58.181 --> 04:59.443
Hang him !

05:03.052 --> 05:05.577
May God have mercy on this man.

05:10.927 --> 05:13.122
Out of the way. Get back.

05:19.936 --> 05:23.895
I have a stay of execution
signed by President Jefferson himself.

05:23.973 --> 05:28.000
See? He signed it right here.
''Thomas Jefferson.''

05:31.447 --> 05:33.472
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

05:38.254 --> 05:42.122
Mr. Hunt, I plan on being the first man
to map a route to the Pacific.

05:42.191 --> 05:44.421
But I require an expert guide.

05:45.495 --> 05:48.089
lf you wanted a tracker,
why did you choose me?

05:48.164 --> 05:51.895
-Why didn't you get William Clark?
-Don't you think I tried?

05:53.536 --> 05:57.336
Meriwether Lewis beat me to him.
I'm sick to death of those two.

05:57.407 --> 05:59.967
Lewis and Clark this. Lewis and Clark that.

06:00.043 --> 06:03.274
We'll see who talks about them
after we beat them to the Pacific.

06:03.346 --> 06:06.213
Then we'll see who gets invited
to the finest parties.

06:06.282 --> 06:10.946
We'll see who's able to parlay their
accomplishments into a political career.

06:12.221 --> 06:13.848
When the history books are written...

06:13.923 --> 06:16.551
Lewis and Clark will be
but a footnote to a footnote...

06:16.626 --> 06:19.720
and I, sir, will be the note.

06:24.333 --> 06:27.234
My hands will grow rough,
my teeth may yellow...

06:27.303 --> 06:30.204
I might even experience
a general soreness in the joints.

06:30.273 --> 06:34.107
Yes, this mission will be
a treacherous one, make no mistake.

06:34.177 --> 06:37.977
We will face danger from savages
and from bears.

06:39.348 --> 06:43.148
These bears are wild, mind you.
Not trained carnival bears...

06:45.021 --> 06:48.752
-with little hats.
-Sounds exhilarating, sir.

06:48.858 --> 06:52.157
Few men would have the courage
for such an endeavor.

06:52.295 --> 06:56.732
I'm not afraid, Mr. Burr.
My mind will protect me.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.493
I'm a man of science, a man of learning...

06:59.569 --> 07:02.470
a man who knows
how to buy the finest books.

07:02.638 --> 07:07.098
Fear will be our breakfast,
and stark-raving terror our daily luncheon.

07:07.310 --> 07:08.572
Mr. Hunt?

07:12.115 --> 07:13.377
Mr. Hunt?

07:14.650 --> 07:17.881
I'd be more worried about the Indians
than the bears.

07:17.954 --> 07:20.013
It's common knowledge that...

07:20.089 --> 07:23.115
when the savages capture a white man...

07:23.192 --> 07:25.319
they will split open his head...

07:25.394 --> 07:27.794
pick out his brains, and eat them...

07:27.864 --> 07:32.631
with a crudely fashioned fork. So....

07:33.669 --> 07:36.604
Have you witnessed such atrocities,
Mr. Hunt?

07:36.772 --> 07:38.672
I've seen the forks.

07:49.152 --> 07:52.315
You look like a man
who appreciates good whiskey.

07:53.289 --> 07:54.551
Thank you, sir.

07:54.624 --> 07:58.287
But I fear inebriation may cause me
to forget my manners...

07:58.361 --> 08:00.352
in such fine company.

08:00.530 --> 08:03.294
Good God, man,
I'm not talking about getting blind drunk.

08:03.366 --> 08:05.766
I just meant for you to have a taste.

08:05.835 --> 08:09.737
Well then, taste it shall be.

08:20.049 --> 08:21.277
Not bad.

08:23.886 --> 08:26.320
How about you get your own bottle?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.404
Good morning.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.635
I had Jonah put you in here last night.

08:45.841 --> 08:50.073
It seemed a barn was the only suitable
place for a man in your condition.

08:50.146 --> 08:53.343
I think there was something wrong
with that whiskey.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.808
My head is splitting open.

08:56.686 --> 08:58.813
I'm surprised you're hungover at all...

08:58.888 --> 09:02.688
considering the amount you regurgitated
into the harpsichord.

09:07.396 --> 09:10.194
Look. Sorry about that.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.357
I'd better go now.

09:15.004 --> 09:18.440
Mr. Hunt,
I cannot go on this journey without you.

09:18.808 --> 09:22.710
I'm offering you a full partnership.
What do you think of that?

09:23.646 --> 09:26.774
I think it ain't worth the spit you wasted
saying it.

09:26.849 --> 09:29.249
I'm also willing to pay you $100.

09:34.790 --> 09:37.020
-$200.
-$125.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.722
$150.

09:40.296 --> 09:41.388
Deal.

09:44.200 --> 09:49.001
Great things are in store for us.
Soon our names will be on the lips of....

09:49.839 --> 09:52.535
Well, on a great many influential lips.

09:53.776 --> 09:55.903
Are you listening, Mr. Hunt?

10:01.250 --> 10:04.344
I believe
those pigs would prefer their privacy.

10:05.621 --> 10:09.921
Hell. I paid good money
to see this on stage in Louisville.

10:10.326 --> 10:14.285
Of course, there the pigs were dressed
like the King and Queen of France.

10:15.931 --> 10:18.126
Costumes. Legitimate theater.

10:31.781 --> 10:33.544
I'm looking for Leslie Edwards.

10:33.616 --> 10:36.141
-I am Leslie Edwards.
-My name's Jackson.

10:36.252 --> 10:40.211
It's been my lifelong dream
to see the Pacific Ocean before I die.

10:40.289 --> 10:41.551
Please take me with you.

10:41.624 --> 10:46.288
An old bag of bones like you
wouldn't make it 100 yards upriver.

10:46.362 --> 10:49.923
On my worst day
I could still beat the stuffing out of you...

10:49.999 --> 10:51.899
you puffed-up crow's cock.

10:51.967 --> 10:54.527
-No, you couldn't.
-I know.

10:54.970 --> 10:58.098
Please take me with you.
I must see the Pacific.

10:58.708 --> 11:03.304
-Can you deny an old man his dream?
-I cannot, and I will not.

11:03.612 --> 11:06.137
Jackson, you may accompany us.

11:06.816 --> 11:09.512
-Horse's ass.
-Turd!

11:09.685 --> 11:13.280
-Help us load the boats.
-Sorry, can't do. I'm an old man.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.417
Edwards, this man says you hired him
as an interpreter.

11:19.495 --> 11:22.487
-You must be Guy Fontenot.
-I am.

11:22.565 --> 11:25.363
It is my understanding
that you've mastered the languages...

11:25.434 --> 11:29.131
of all the indigenous populations
from here to the Pacific.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.729
-Who told you this?
-Why, you did, in your letter.

11:33.976 --> 11:35.307
My letter?

11:35.978 --> 11:37.343
The letter.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.872
-Yes. Then it is the truth.
-Wonderful.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.941
Which boat will we be in?

11:44.487 --> 11:47.456
-We?
-Fontenot wants to bring his wife.

11:47.590 --> 11:50.320
-I told him he can't.
-She's not my wife.

11:50.393 --> 11:53.123
Not my wife. I buy her.

11:53.696 --> 11:55.994
She belong to me as a property.

11:57.032 --> 11:59.296
Well, the distinction has been noted.

11:59.769 --> 12:02.863
Unfortunately, as you can see,
the boats have been fully loaded...

12:02.938 --> 12:06.339
and we haven't even taken on my hats
and tea service.

12:06.409 --> 12:08.377
They say you can't come.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.474
You didn't let me finish.

12:16.719 --> 12:20.780
Certainly we can make room.
I mean, who needs tea?

12:22.758 --> 12:24.419
Let it be known...

12:24.827 --> 12:28.524
that if I catch any man looking at her...

12:29.265 --> 12:32.291
I will cut him like a pig.

12:32.701 --> 12:35.795
Yes, I'll see if I can work that
into my speech.

12:46.615 --> 12:47.809
Father.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.785
Dear Lord in Heaven...

12:53.055 --> 12:55.956
bless us as we leave this Christian world...

12:56.625 --> 13:00.618
and give us courage to bring
your gospel of love and tolerance...

13:01.096 --> 13:04.088
to the ignorant,
godless savages who await us.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.293
Amen.

13:10.573 --> 13:14.304
-All right. Let's go!
-Hold on, Mr. Hunt. Hold on, everyone.

13:15.144 --> 13:18.773
I prepared a short address
to commemorate our embarkation.

13:19.081 --> 13:20.446
Here we go.

13:20.516 --> 13:24.111
Men, we are about to embark
on an unprecedented adventure...

13:24.186 --> 13:26.916
to the great Northwest.

13:27.723 --> 13:30.521
Unfortunately, Lewis and Clark
have a two-week head start...

13:30.593 --> 13:32.618
so time is of the essence.

13:32.828 --> 13:35.296
We will be pushing up the Missouri.

13:35.364 --> 13:37.992
What? Against the current?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.725
Mightn't it be easier
to go down the Mississippi...

13:40.803 --> 13:44.637
-instead of up the Missouri?
-Yes, it most certainly would be.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.565
We could go to New Orleans instead.

13:49.144 --> 13:52.204
Gentlemen,
we have already been to New Orleans.

13:52.715 --> 13:55.149
Sir, I've been to New Orleans.
It's wonderful.

13:55.217 --> 13:58.846
I've been there as well.
The food alone is worth the trip.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.555
The food, sir.

14:03.292 --> 14:04.691
New Orleans.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.254
All right, fine!

14:10.733 --> 14:13.566
Any man who is too cowardly
to share the greatest adventure...

14:13.636 --> 14:15.297
in our young country's history...

14:15.371 --> 14:19.239
and would rather experience
the decadence of New Orleans, well...

14:19.308 --> 14:21.071
then go right ahead.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.749
Mr. Hunt, do something.

14:31.820 --> 14:34.448
Next man who leaves for New Orleans...

14:34.723 --> 14:38.591
will do so with a lead ball in his back!

14:39.061 --> 14:42.258
Need I remind you
that you all have signed contracts?

14:42.331 --> 14:43.923
What about them?

14:45.334 --> 14:48.303
-They will be deaIt with.
-By who?

14:50.806 --> 14:54.242
-All right, they escaped.
-Now get in the boat!

14:56.946 --> 14:58.208
Everyone.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.449
<i>And so our journey begins.</i>

15:04.954 --> 15:07.980
<i>I believe the men and I share
a tremendous sense of excitement...</i>

15:08.057 --> 15:10.651
<i>and anticipation for what lies ahead.</i>

15:21.437 --> 15:22.563
Thank you, Higgins.

15:22.638 --> 15:26.301
Your music will be a welcome companion
on our long journey.

15:26.775 --> 15:30.233
Men, we'll be following
the map of trapper Pierre LeBlanc...

15:30.312 --> 15:33.372
who explored the Missouri in 1792.

15:34.216 --> 15:36.684
Hunt,
you've traversed most of these territories.

15:36.752 --> 15:39.915
Tell the men
what they might expect to encounter.

15:40.155 --> 15:42.487
Okay. Well...

15:42.758 --> 15:46.125
-what I remember most were the animals.
-The animals.

15:50.132 --> 15:53.226
Fearsome beasts
of the mountains and plains.

15:54.837 --> 15:57.271
I seen a bear so powerful...

15:57.640 --> 16:02.168
that it snapped a man's body in half
with his huge jaws.

16:06.715 --> 16:10.310
I seen a badger with paws
as big as frying pans.

16:10.786 --> 16:13.914
They'd rip your face right off. Right off!

16:14.023 --> 16:17.117
There's nothing you can do with that.
Just rip it off.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.218
Once there was a hawk
that swooped down from the sky...

16:24.299 --> 16:27.393
and plucked a man's eyeballs
out of his sockets.

16:29.038 --> 16:33.236
The fellow was screaming,
''I’m blind, I can't see!

16:35.411 --> 16:37.606
''I can't get it off! ''

16:37.946 --> 16:40.414
-Twice when I was fishing--
-Hunt...

16:41.116 --> 16:44.517
-I think you're scaring the men.
-I think it's best they know.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.749
Gives a man courage
to know what he's up against.

16:48.323 --> 16:50.791
There's an animal now!

17:04.373 --> 17:05.635
Kill him !

17:10.878 --> 17:13.006
We can't kill it.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.973
We're all dead!

17:15.284 --> 17:18.310
-God save us!
-Hold your fire!

17:26.627 --> 17:28.425
It’s only a squirrel.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.932
He's got something in his hand!

17:41.009 --> 17:43.170
<i>31 May, 1804.</i>

17:44.046 --> 17:46.879
<i>We are now spending our first night
in the wilds.</i>

17:46.949 --> 17:48.007
<i>From this point on...</i>

17:48.083 --> 17:51.382
<i>hardship and deprivation will be
our constant companions.</i>

17:54.123 --> 17:56.990
Jonah, it is absolutely brutal out here.

17:57.192 --> 18:00.628
The water's nowhere near as hot
as it was in Virginia.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.194
I wouldn't know, sir.

18:02.264 --> 18:06.598
Personally, I just finished
washing my privates in the ice-cold river.

18:07.536 --> 18:11.734
I think I’ll.... Yes, I think I’ll wear
my paisley robe this evening.

18:12.141 --> 18:14.871
-It’s your prerogative, sir.
-Yes, it is.

18:19.782 --> 18:22.012
Mr. Hunt here to see you, sir.

18:24.553 --> 18:28.182
I just thought I'd tell you there's already
a problem with the men's morale.

18:28.257 --> 18:31.192
It’s our first night out.
How can there already be a problem?

18:31.260 --> 18:34.491
One faction feels that you're distant,
you don't care about them.

18:34.563 --> 18:38.363
Another group feels that the original
high-minded goals of the expedition...

18:38.433 --> 18:41.061
have been abandoned for quick profits.

18:41.470 --> 18:45.031
You have to keep on top of these things.

18:47.876 --> 18:52.745
...and we're all in this together.
We are no different from one another.

18:52.815 --> 18:57.047
Except, of course, for our rank in society
and in this company.

19:00.589 --> 19:02.784
Let us get better acquainted.

19:03.258 --> 19:05.886
What do you do with your leisure time?

19:07.229 --> 19:08.696
Leisure time.

19:09.097 --> 19:12.260
You know, time for yourself
where you don't have to work.

19:13.969 --> 19:17.132
Leisure.... Never mind.

19:18.974 --> 19:23.775
You there, fingering that stomach wound.
Stand up and tell us a little about yourself.

19:25.814 --> 19:29.045
-Me, sir?
-Yes, you. Bidwell, isn't it?

19:32.020 --> 19:35.251
Yes, sir. What did you want to know?

19:35.924 --> 19:39.360
Well, anything. Where are you from?
What's your family like?

19:41.830 --> 19:43.593
Name's Bidwell, sir.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.793
Yes, I know that.

19:46.969 --> 19:49.403
All right. Well. Anyone else?

19:49.671 --> 19:52.003
Sir, Higgins has a story.

19:52.140 --> 19:55.871
Oh, yes. You're going to love this one.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.141
Well, all right, Higgins. The floor is yours.

20:01.817 --> 20:06.311
This particular event happened last
summer on my uncle's farm in Virginia.

20:06.855 --> 20:10.586
My brother and I
had just finished cutting a field of hay...

20:10.792 --> 20:14.853
and were enjoying the evening meal
under the shade of an elm tree.

20:15.764 --> 20:19.495
He went down for water by the creek,
and while he was gone...

20:19.768 --> 20:23.898
I took a bowl that was filled
with delicious plum pudding...

20:24.072 --> 20:26.700
and placed into it, not one...

20:27.109 --> 20:30.738
but two large pieces of sheep shit.

20:35.550 --> 20:39.350
When he returned, I encouraged him
to taste the plum pudding.

20:39.488 --> 20:43.015
And as sure as I’m standing
before you today, he did.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.226
He ate it all. Shit pudding.

20:46.862 --> 20:48.830
He ate shit pudding.

20:59.374 --> 21:03.140
-You got your brother to eat sheep dung.
-Yes.

21:04.279 --> 21:06.679
Yes, that's a very amusing story.

21:10.619 --> 21:13.986
Tell him the ending. That's the best part.

21:16.758 --> 21:20.455
And to be completely honest, sir,
I have no brother.

21:21.063 --> 21:25.796
It was me! I ate sheep shit. I swear I did!

21:31.606 --> 21:34.632
Yes, clever twist on the end there.

21:36.511 --> 21:40.072
I think we've become well enough
acquainted for one evening.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.778
Fun, fun.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.689
He hasn't got a brother.

21:58.533 --> 22:03.061
Higgins, when I said your music would be
a welcome companion, I didn't mean--

22:03.138 --> 22:05.971
Don't you know any other goddamn tune?

22:07.476 --> 22:10.343
-No, sir.
-Of course you do, lad.

22:10.812 --> 22:14.270
Play them that haunting air
you played me this morning.

22:37.172 --> 22:38.332
Quiet.

22:42.277 --> 22:45.041
-What is it?
-Indians.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.712
These are the Iowas.

22:50.318 --> 22:53.685
Fontenot, please greet this man
in his native tongue.

22:57.893 --> 22:59.417
Why do I laugh?

22:59.895 --> 23:03.592
You see, of the hundreds of language
that I speak fluent...

23:04.666 --> 23:06.634
this is not one of them.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.400
Bad luck.

23:12.574 --> 23:16.010
They do trade with whites.
He probably speaks English.

23:18.280 --> 23:22.512
Good day. I bring you wishes for peace
from Thomas Jefferson...

23:22.584 --> 23:24.814
the Great Chief of the Whites.

23:27.856 --> 23:31.292
You've insulted him.
You forgot to introduce yourself.

23:31.626 --> 23:33.526
I’m Bartholomew Hunt...

23:33.995 --> 23:36.327
and this here is Leslie Edwards.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.664
Your turn.

23:40.068 --> 23:43.765
I was told you speak English. Is this so?

23:46.775 --> 23:50.472
-We seem to be making some progress.
-Let me try something.

23:52.714 --> 23:56.275
We wish to try....

23:57.319 --> 23:58.718
Forget this.

24:03.325 --> 24:07.091
We come in peace
on behalf of President Jefferson.

24:07.162 --> 24:09.392
-You....
-Hunt.

24:16.171 --> 24:20.005
-I am Chief Two Roads.
-lf you're the Chief, then who is that?

24:20.542 --> 24:23.978
His name is Bent Twig.
He's not right in the head.

25:02.851 --> 25:05.479
I’ve got it. Now what do I do with it?

25:05.720 --> 25:07.915
-Put it on.
-All right.

25:24.573 --> 25:27.440
Good news.
Looks like they're gonna let us live.

25:27.509 --> 25:28.498
Let us live?

25:28.577 --> 25:31.341
I had to give them
a few of your finer things, of course...

25:31.413 --> 25:32.903
so they wouldn't kill us.

25:32.981 --> 25:36.109
-They seemed so friendly.
-That's the way of the savage.

25:36.184 --> 25:39.381
Pretend to be your friend, share a drink,
listen to your problems.

25:39.454 --> 25:42.787
Next thing you know, they're scooping
your brains out with a spoon.

25:42.857 --> 25:44.518
You mean a fork.

25:44.593 --> 25:47.027
That would depend on the tribe.

25:50.932 --> 25:54.163
Mr. Hunt,
the Iowas would never have killed us.

25:54.236 --> 25:55.533
I know that.

25:55.604 --> 25:59.062
I’m just not carrying that junk with us
the whole trip.

26:08.550 --> 26:11.018
Help me! You keep away!

26:11.953 --> 26:13.944
What the hell's going on?

26:14.623 --> 26:16.488
Bidwell, take it easy.

26:18.693 --> 26:19.990
What's happening here?

26:20.061 --> 26:22.757
Sir, that French animal bit my ear off.

26:23.431 --> 26:25.661
That's an absurd exaggeration.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.864
My apologies, Bidwell.

26:29.938 --> 26:31.633
He look in our tent.

26:31.706 --> 26:35.437
He look at my woman. He saw her breast.

26:36.378 --> 26:39.245
Her breast? You saw her breast?

26:39.781 --> 26:42.181
I’ll say it before, and I said it again:

26:42.250 --> 26:46.084
Any man who look on her will die.

26:53.295 --> 26:56.526
Look at me.
I’m going to make an experiment.

26:58.300 --> 27:00.530
Hello. Bidwell?

27:01.236 --> 27:02.863
Can you hear me?

27:03.204 --> 27:05.104
I can hear you, Pratt.

27:06.174 --> 27:07.436
It works.

27:07.842 --> 27:10.743
Well, of course it works.
He's standing right....

27:11.880 --> 27:13.677
Let's get some sleep.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.480
Good night, Bidwell.

27:23.958 --> 27:26.153
<i>The race to the Pacific continues.</i>

27:26.227 --> 27:28.752
<i>Although still bent on
beating Lewis and Clark...</i>

27:28.830 --> 27:32.027
<i>I am cataloging new varieties
of flora and fauna.</i>

27:32.334 --> 27:35.098
<i>I seem to be the only man
with an interest in science...</i>

27:35.170 --> 27:39.197
<i>aside from Pratt and his dubious
experiment with Bidwell's ear.</i>

27:39.908 --> 27:42.741
I shall name this flower Amanda's bloom.

27:42.977 --> 27:47.710
Mr. Hunt, as my partner, you should be
naming some of our discoveries as well.

27:49.317 --> 27:51.217
-Me?
-Yes.

27:52.687 --> 27:55.986
You could name that fork in the river,
for instance.

27:56.558 --> 27:59.994
Perhaps there's a loved one
you'd care to immortalize?

28:00.362 --> 28:01.693
Loved one?

28:02.630 --> 28:04.393
Yeah. Sure.

28:06.301 --> 28:07.495
I know.

28:08.303 --> 28:12.706
I name this here fork Pittsburgh Nellie.

28:13.908 --> 28:17.503
A Welsh whore who could do things
with her one good arm...

28:17.579 --> 28:20.776
that would make you forget
that thing on her neck.

28:27.389 --> 28:30.483
<i>By permitting Mr. Hunt
to name some of our discoveries...</i>

28:30.558 --> 28:32.958
<i>I have unleashed his imagination.</i>

28:33.161 --> 28:35.721
<i>He now insists that I teach him to read.</i>

28:35.797 --> 28:39.392
<i>His enthusiasm reminds me
of the schoolboy I once was.</i>

28:39.801 --> 28:41.735
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

28:41.836 --> 28:43.167
Excellent.

28:43.438 --> 28:46.202
This is the uppercase...

28:47.675 --> 28:48.733
''A.''

28:48.943 --> 28:50.808
You know, I spent a day in school once...

28:50.879 --> 28:54.610
but the schoolmarm claimed
that I just couldn't concentrate.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.148
Well, let's prove her wrong, shall we?

28:57.419 --> 29:00.855
You know, I’ve waited years
to hear somebody say that.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.150
Again.

29:04.025 --> 29:05.117
Hunt.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.196
This is the uppercase ''A.''

29:11.633 --> 29:14.500
The uppercase ''A.''

29:16.070 --> 29:17.435
I got that.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.504
All right.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.940
And this is the lowercase...

29:30.685 --> 29:31.743
''a.''

29:33.888 --> 29:35.082
The...

29:36.257 --> 29:38.851
lowercase...

29:39.527 --> 29:40.585
''a.''

29:45.800 --> 29:47.028
Oh, God.

29:56.277 --> 29:59.337
Got it. Okay.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.976
-And this is the--
-Enough!

30:05.987 --> 30:08.820
Do you want my head to explode?

30:09.858 --> 30:13.350
In the name of all
that is good and decent...

30:13.995 --> 30:16.020
no more for today!

30:22.370 --> 30:25.931
<i>In exchange for reading lessons,
Mr. Hunt reciprocates...</i>

30:26.040 --> 30:28.941
<i>by teaching me some of his frontier skills.</i>

30:30.879 --> 30:32.847
The buffalo is near now.

30:33.982 --> 30:36.576
You can tell that
just by sniffing its droppings?

30:36.651 --> 30:39.381
No. I can see the herd right over there.

30:42.891 --> 30:44.654
Then why are you....

31:05.013 --> 31:06.674
No, I shouldn't.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.850
I couldn't possibly....

31:19.027 --> 31:20.255
Edwards!

31:23.698 --> 31:27.225
You're not doing any naming up here
without me, partner?

31:28.036 --> 31:29.162
No.

31:29.971 --> 31:33.873
-What are you looking at?
-The moon. I was looking at the moon.

31:34.609 --> 31:37.339
For me, the moon brings to mind romance.

31:37.912 --> 31:38.901
Yeah.

31:39.380 --> 31:41.974
Have you ever been in love, Mr. Hunt?

31:42.584 --> 31:45.917
I’ve had my head under a petticoat or two.

31:48.122 --> 31:49.453
Good Lord.

31:49.591 --> 31:53.493
Must you and the others
reduce everything to its crudest terms?

31:54.963 --> 31:58.057
I thought I cleaned it up rather nicely
for you.

31:58.166 --> 32:01.829
Mr. Hunt, behold the object of my desire.

32:02.604 --> 32:06.301
Behold an angel sent down from on high.

32:08.643 --> 32:11.441
''Angel from on high.''

32:19.354 --> 32:21.447
Oh, my God.

32:22.256 --> 32:25.248
From here on out,
you keep your distance, all right?

32:25.326 --> 32:27.021
What? No.

32:28.730 --> 32:33.099
No.
Get out of the way, you big French oaf!

32:34.969 --> 32:36.732
Behind Fontenot.

32:40.475 --> 32:41.874
Now do you see?

32:42.477 --> 32:44.069
Yeah, now I see.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.872
All right, that's enough.

32:51.819 --> 32:54.982
I said all right, Mr. Hunt.
That will be enough.

32:55.957 --> 32:57.424
I understand.

32:58.259 --> 33:00.693
You want to watch her by yourself.

33:04.098 --> 33:08.592
You want to be alone
so you can shake hands with Ben Franklin.

33:11.539 --> 33:14.201
You know, polish the pewter.

33:15.043 --> 33:17.978
Polish the pewter?
Jonah does that for me.

33:18.279 --> 33:19.678
Yeah, right.

33:20.181 --> 33:21.443
What? No.

33:22.050 --> 33:24.644
Mr. Hunt, I assure you I’ve never....

33:25.820 --> 33:27.117
<i>July 10.</i>

33:27.188 --> 33:28.416
<i>I’ve driven the men hard...</i>

33:28.489 --> 33:31.890
<i>and I’m positive we've closed the gap
on Lewis and Clark.</i>

33:31.959 --> 33:35.292
<i>However, because of the currents,
I surmised that we'd be better off...</i>

33:35.363 --> 33:37.957
<i>portaging for the next several miles.</i>

33:39.467 --> 33:43.267
<i>It’s hard work, but it's nothing
compared to the deadly currents...</i>

33:43.337 --> 33:46.067
<i>we'd be battling on the mighty Missouri.</i>

33:46.407 --> 33:47.806
Here we go!

34:43.531 --> 34:45.192
Everybody, wake up.

34:50.371 --> 34:53.670
Oh, my God.

34:55.743 --> 34:58.041
Whatever you do, don't move.

34:58.112 --> 35:00.842
lf he sees you move, you're dead.

35:01.783 --> 35:05.150
-My nose itches.
-Don't scratch it.

35:05.386 --> 35:08.822
-Feels like there's a bug up in there.
-Wait.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.324
I think it's leaving.

35:16.230 --> 35:19.859
-I’m gonna scratch it.
-You scratch your nose, you're dead.

35:19.934 --> 35:23.301
I don't know what's worse,
the bear or my itchy nose.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.537
No. Don't.

35:34.982 --> 35:38.440
The bear is worse.
The bear is definitely worse!

35:43.658 --> 35:46.456
That poor, poor man.

35:49.897 --> 35:52.195
Bidwell, can you hear me?

35:56.571 --> 35:59.506
I fear the bear has killed Mr. Bidwell, sir.

35:59.874 --> 36:03.071
He's failed to communicate with me
by way of his ear.

36:03.144 --> 36:06.341
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work any way.

36:06.948 --> 36:10.042
But even if it did,
he couldn't talk through it.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.619
Never mind.

36:16.190 --> 36:17.418
Help me.

36:21.529 --> 36:23.224
-Bidwell!
-Sir.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.367
Sir, I’ve been to hell and back.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.732
Yes, I can see that.

36:29.971 --> 36:33.236
I suspect that now you'll want
to lead a hunting party...

36:33.307 --> 36:35.434
to slay that terrible beast.

36:35.943 --> 36:39.401
Yes, that thought
did cross my mind briefly.

36:40.081 --> 36:42.879
-But now I have a better idea.
-Yes, sir?

36:43.618 --> 36:47.520
I shall fashion for you
the finest wooden leg you've ever seen.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.053
But what about the bear?

36:51.125 --> 36:54.720
Rest assured, Bidwell.
In 20 years or so, the ravages of old age...

36:54.795 --> 36:58.788
will deal with the bear far more cruelly
than we ever could have.

36:59.901 --> 37:02.301
Revenge is sweet, sir.

37:07.241 --> 37:08.469
<i>July 29.</i>

37:09.076 --> 37:13.069
<i>We reach the final settlement
before entering uncharted territory...</i>

37:13.147 --> 37:15.115
<i>and God only knows what.</i>

37:24.191 --> 37:28.423
-There. It seems as if we've arrived.
-Wait. I can read it.

37:46.781 --> 37:48.772
For the love of God, man!

37:49.483 --> 37:53.044
It says, ''Welcome to Snakes Bend.''

37:53.321 --> 37:55.312
Oh, God, yeah.

37:56.724 --> 37:58.123
Onward, men.

37:59.427 --> 38:01.622
Snakes Bend. Almost had it.

38:07.568 --> 38:08.830
I got it.

38:16.110 --> 38:17.839
Yes, it's a tavern.

38:19.213 --> 38:23.877
I think it would be a nice gesture
if I bought the men a few tankards of ale.

38:23.951 --> 38:25.816
A nice gesture indeed.

38:27.288 --> 38:29.688
We both know how you get
when you drink.

38:29.757 --> 38:31.554
Oh, yes, we do.

38:33.761 --> 38:38.255
And that's why I think you should go
to the trading post for supplies now.

38:42.703 --> 38:44.694
All right, men. Fun, fun.

38:57.251 --> 39:00.482
-To Capt. Edwards.
-Capt. Edwards.

39:02.656 --> 39:07.491
Excuse me. I had heard
there was a party of brave men here.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.786
I’m here to tell you...

39:08.863 --> 39:13.698
that I’m not unfamiliar with the ways of
men who've been long in the wilderness.

39:14.201 --> 39:17.102
I understand their cravings
for food and drink...

39:17.171 --> 39:20.902
and also their cravings
for the companionship of young women.

39:20.975 --> 39:24.035
-Women. He's got women!
-Where are they?

39:24.145 --> 39:27.273
Wait for me outside.
I will take you to them.

39:27.982 --> 39:29.210
Come on.

39:30.918 --> 39:32.249
Gentlemen?

39:33.320 --> 39:36.585
My woman pleasure me whenever I want.

39:37.358 --> 39:41.317
Yes, I shall refrain, as well.
I made a solemn promise to someone.

39:41.595 --> 39:42.789
Really?

39:42.963 --> 39:45.488
Yes, I promised my doctor I wouldn't...

39:45.666 --> 39:48.396
engage in that sort of thing.

39:49.703 --> 39:52.331
-Got a drippy dong?
-No.

39:52.706 --> 39:55.766
No more than normal.
It drips when it should...

39:56.010 --> 39:58.410
and it doesn't when it shouldn't.

40:02.183 --> 40:03.775
Will that be it?

40:04.118 --> 40:07.554
Let's see. Beans, rope.

40:08.622 --> 40:09.884
Is there a barber in town?

40:09.957 --> 40:11.720
-I’m a barber, sir.
-Fine.

40:11.926 --> 40:13.655
I’ll have a haircut and a shave.

40:13.727 --> 40:14.751
By the way...

40:14.829 --> 40:16.956
you smell like something
that's been passed...

40:17.031 --> 40:19.056
through the system of a sick old woman.

40:19.133 --> 40:23.035
Well, maybe I’ll have a bath, too, then.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.328
Good idea.

40:26.740 --> 40:30.073
This way, gentlemen. Don't be shy.

40:31.145 --> 40:33.670
Come in and meet the ladies.

40:38.619 --> 40:41.918
Did I not tell you they were beautiful?

40:44.458 --> 40:46.392
Don't you have any real women?

40:46.460 --> 40:50.487
These women may be whores,
but they have their dignity.

40:50.998 --> 40:55.458
Now, who would like to be
the first to introduce himself?

41:01.609 --> 41:05.978
Hello, my dear.
My name is Hieronymus Pratt.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.774
Might you have relatives
in Richmond, Virginia?

41:23.230 --> 41:26.791
Some of them flies were there
before I got in.

41:33.207 --> 41:36.404
-I just saw Hidalgo.
-Hidalgo? With all his men?

41:36.677 --> 41:40.010
No, just half a dozen.
But they're headed this way!

41:42.016 --> 41:45.213
Double my wages
for anyone who will take my shift.

41:49.123 --> 41:51.318
I have heard of this Hidalgo.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.284
A Spaniard who wander the Northwest.

41:54.528 --> 41:57.224
Even crazy people think he's....

42:16.684 --> 42:18.549
Did you say something?

42:19.587 --> 42:21.248
No, I....

42:21.388 --> 42:24.016
You said something about my hair.

42:24.391 --> 42:26.518
-No.
-Why not?

42:27.661 --> 42:29.561
You don't like my hair?

42:30.231 --> 42:33.200
-Yes, it's nice.
-''Nice''?

42:34.368 --> 42:36.268
My hair is magnificent.

42:37.071 --> 42:39.096
It’s long and soft...

42:39.173 --> 42:42.336
and shines with the light
that comes from within. Can't you see it?

42:42.409 --> 42:44.900
-Yes, it's beautiful.
-Beautiful, yes.

42:45.246 --> 42:47.237
That's all I have to say.

42:47.748 --> 42:49.773
Sorry if I frightened you.

42:52.586 --> 42:53.848
Good God!

42:55.022 --> 42:56.114
Good.

42:57.057 --> 42:59.457
-You do good work.
-Thank you, sir.

42:59.526 --> 43:02.552
I strive for excellence
in all my various trades.

43:02.630 --> 43:05.656
Tell me, among those trades,
you wouldn't happen to practice--

43:05.733 --> 43:07.064
Taxidermy?

43:07.935 --> 43:10.733
No, I was going to say dentistry.

43:11.438 --> 43:12.871
I’m primarily a taxidermist.

43:12.940 --> 43:16.933
However, I have practiced dentistry
on the animals I’ve preserved.

43:20.648 --> 43:22.639
And of course, over there.

43:23.784 --> 43:25.376
Good.

43:25.452 --> 43:30.219
'Cause I have got a molar
that's been bothering me since St. Louis.

43:30.991 --> 43:32.652
I can oblige, sir.

43:33.193 --> 43:36.629
He said, ''I know.
It wasn't a horse, it was a donkey.''

43:50.911 --> 43:52.674
Her hair is perfect.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.238
It’s beautiful.

43:56.116 --> 43:57.811
Is this your woman?

43:57.885 --> 43:59.546
She belong to me.

43:59.820 --> 44:02.618
-And who are you?
-Guy Fontenot.

44:03.524 --> 44:06.152
You may call me Hidalgo.

44:06.860 --> 44:08.122
Hidalgo.

44:09.029 --> 44:13.022
I wander the Northwest Territory
searching for a fabulous place.

44:14.335 --> 44:17.327
A place where the earth trembles
and speaks...

44:17.471 --> 44:21.100
and a white cross marks the location
of an age-old secret.

44:21.809 --> 44:23.504
And what is the secret?

44:24.078 --> 44:27.275
You try to trick me
with your deceiving questions.

44:28.716 --> 44:32.777
But you will learn nothing,
not unless you join us.

44:33.620 --> 44:36.020
Come on. You are perfect.

44:36.323 --> 44:37.847
lf you join us...

44:37.925 --> 44:42.521
everything that belongs to you
belongs to me, too.

44:43.230 --> 44:44.561
And if I don't?

44:44.631 --> 44:48.965
Then we tear out your heart,
cut off your limbs and skin you alive.

44:49.870 --> 44:52.839
-I’ll join.
-Good. I’m delighted.

44:55.442 --> 44:58.434
-Now this should dull your senses.
-All right.

44:59.313 --> 45:01.975
What are you doing?
What, are you trying to kill me?

45:02.049 --> 45:06.008
Put it down.
Put the thing down and pull my tooth.

45:06.387 --> 45:07.854
God Almighty.

45:10.858 --> 45:13.349
All right. Say ''ah.''

45:15.129 --> 45:16.824
-In the back.
-All right.

45:19.032 --> 45:20.795
That guy's in there.

45:34.281 --> 45:37.546
-Come on, let's go.
-Don't take her.

45:39.219 --> 45:40.811
Take me instead.

45:49.730 --> 45:51.857
Put your hands on your hips.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.665
No. Like this.

46:17.357 --> 46:21.657
And here I’ve avoided the dentist for years
because I thought it'd hurt.

46:22.729 --> 46:24.196
Look at that.

46:24.598 --> 46:28.159
No. I think I’ll still keep the woman.
Come on, let's go.

46:28.435 --> 46:31.165
You can't take a woman against her will.

46:33.540 --> 46:37.374
Of course, maybe it's time for her
to spread her wings and fly.

46:41.515 --> 46:42.880
Well, well.

46:44.585 --> 46:46.348
What have we got here?

46:48.655 --> 46:50.179
Hey, sonny boy.

46:51.058 --> 46:55.085
Your mother wants her roasting pan back
when you're done playing with it.

46:55.162 --> 46:58.996
I challenge you and the rest
of your ladies in armor to a duel.

46:59.066 --> 47:03.093
-All of us?
-Every poofy prancing one of you.

47:03.604 --> 47:06.334
<i>We are more than equal to a duel, senor.</i>

47:06.773 --> 47:10.231
Especially since you won't live
past the first contest.

47:12.679 --> 47:14.772
What weapons do you choose?

47:14.882 --> 47:18.511
Pistols, swords, or bare fists?

47:19.987 --> 47:21.147
Drink.

47:22.055 --> 47:23.215
Drink?

47:25.492 --> 47:26.823
Time's up.

47:32.332 --> 47:33.492
Sorry.

47:34.902 --> 47:37.735
I swear that's never happened
to me before.

48:28.188 --> 48:31.646
Well done, Mr. Hunt.
I’m deeply impressed and grateful.

48:33.961 --> 48:35.861
Maybe now you'll agree...

48:36.430 --> 48:38.455
drinking has its benefits.

48:39.866 --> 48:41.527
You saved my life.

48:43.070 --> 48:44.970
Maybe now you'll agree...

48:45.472 --> 48:47.497
drinking has its benefits.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.071
You just said that.

48:50.444 --> 48:52.435
Now, if you don't mind...

48:53.513 --> 48:56.243
it's time for the liquor to take effect.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.012
Fire!

49:01.488 --> 49:04.582
My furniture. My draperies. My women!

49:05.058 --> 49:06.958
Pratt's still in there!

49:20.507 --> 49:22.600
It’s all my fault, Captain.

49:22.709 --> 49:26.805
She said she didn't mind if I smoked.
I believed her.

49:29.916 --> 49:33.852
Let's retrieve Hunt from the tavern
and get back to the boat.

49:35.122 --> 49:38.489
I think we've seen all
that Snakes Bend has to offer.

49:40.193 --> 49:41.455
My heart.

49:51.138 --> 49:54.039
Permission to check
on the condition of my woman, sir.

49:54.107 --> 49:58.373
I want to check on her bandages
and see if she can keep some food down.

49:58.445 --> 50:01.175
You realize, of course,
this woman of yours...

50:01.248 --> 50:02.715
is made of straw?

50:02.783 --> 50:06.082
Yes, sir.
I figure that's why she burned so easy.

50:34.981 --> 50:35.970
Damn.

50:55.836 --> 50:57.167
Who is it?

50:58.505 --> 51:02.635
Good evening. I was just collecting
samples of bark for President Jefferson.

51:02.709 --> 51:05.007
Some bark. I was collecting it.

51:06.079 --> 51:07.671
Samples of bark.

51:09.683 --> 51:12.015
You're not like these other men.

51:12.586 --> 51:15.783
You're softer, more delicate.

51:16.389 --> 51:19.187
In a rather rough way, right?

51:20.127 --> 51:22.721
Not at all. Look at you.

51:24.765 --> 51:26.164
Thin wrists...

51:27.634 --> 51:29.261
skin like a baby...

51:31.404 --> 51:33.599
almost a total absence of shoulders.

51:33.673 --> 51:37.006
All right,
I think you've flattered me quite enough.

51:49.656 --> 51:52.750
Look at me.
I’m behaving like some kind of animal.

51:52.826 --> 51:54.191
I liked it.

51:56.963 --> 51:59.329
No, no. This can never be.

52:00.167 --> 52:02.135
I’m betrothed to another.

52:02.202 --> 52:04.466
Besides, we come from different worlds.

52:04.538 --> 52:08.065
You are primitive,
and you follow your baser instincts...

52:08.341 --> 52:11.435
and I come from a culture
that values Christian morality.

52:11.511 --> 52:13.706
Maybe one more couldn't hurt.

52:14.447 --> 52:16.244
What? What did I say?

52:16.616 --> 52:17.947
Shaquinna.

52:20.020 --> 52:21.715
I don't see how it's possible...

52:21.788 --> 52:26.225
for the river to flow up and over
those mountains to the western sea.

52:26.960 --> 52:31.397
The river can't flow up and over anything.

52:32.732 --> 52:35.394
So, I guess our journey's over.

52:37.704 --> 52:40.537
No, never. We're pushing on.

52:40.707 --> 52:43.574
We'll scale the Rocky Mountains
within the month...

52:43.777 --> 52:45.745
and then build canoes...

52:46.646 --> 52:50.343
and float down the western slope
before the first frost.

52:52.552 --> 52:53.917
<i>October 29.</i>

52:54.521 --> 52:58.753
<i>What I had hoped was an early dusting
turned out to be somewhat more.</i>

52:59.492 --> 53:03.656
<i>Our journey is half finished,
but our food supply is nearly depleted.</i>

53:04.564 --> 53:07.226
<i>The only man
who seems to be thriving is Pratt...</i>

53:07.300 --> 53:10.292
<i>who is eating what remains
of his straw woman.</i>

53:10.470 --> 53:13.997
<i>As for me, I seem to have come down
with a slight chill.</i>

53:17.077 --> 53:18.169
What?

53:18.245 --> 53:22.272
-What do you think you're doing?
-Last rites.

53:22.816 --> 53:24.807
No, there will be none of that.

53:24.885 --> 53:27.877
Please do not try to bury me
before I am dead.

53:28.288 --> 53:29.516
Go away.

53:39.599 --> 53:40.588
Mama.

53:41.001 --> 53:43.367
I can make medicine that will cure him.

53:43.470 --> 53:46.337
But I will need the egg of an eagle,
or he will die.

53:46.406 --> 53:48.806
The egg of an eagle.

53:49.376 --> 53:51.139
-That's all?
-That is all.

53:51.211 --> 53:52.610
You know...

53:53.280 --> 53:56.875
the last creatures we saw
were way down below the snowline.

53:56.950 --> 54:00.215
You're a very brave man
to do this for your friend.

54:03.323 --> 54:06.053
Ain't nothing more than me doing my job.

54:10.130 --> 54:11.722
Better be going.

54:35.188 --> 54:36.450
Oh, God!

56:43.116 --> 56:45.949
<i>We need the egg of an eagle,
or he will die.</i>

56:46.719 --> 56:48.118
<i>He will die.</i>

57:06.606 --> 57:09.006
Oh, dear God.

57:10.343 --> 57:12.607
President Jefferson, I implore you.

57:12.679 --> 57:16.479
lf we do not give bears the right to vote
they will rise up...

57:16.549 --> 57:18.540
and bears will be in Congress.

57:18.618 --> 57:22.520
And we will be the ones performing
in carnivals wearing little hats.

57:24.424 --> 57:28.417
President Jefferson, a few months ago
I saw a naked Indian woman.

57:29.596 --> 57:33.896
When I saw the naked Indian woman,
I had certain impure thoughts.

57:35.135 --> 57:38.332
Something in me has changed
out here in the wilds.

57:39.439 --> 57:40.929
You must rest.

57:41.708 --> 57:43.801
I saw a naked Indian woman.

57:52.919 --> 57:54.887
No!

58:36.229 --> 58:37.218
Okay.

58:38.631 --> 58:40.121
Where are you?

58:41.801 --> 58:43.928
Protect your little birdies.

58:44.671 --> 58:45.660
Okay.

58:54.347 --> 58:57.646
Come on, you damn bird!
Come and get me!

59:15.835 --> 59:17.462
I got it.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.174
You broke it.

59:32.252 --> 59:34.914
All I needed was the shell. Thank you.

01:00:16.262 --> 01:00:18.230
The medicine is working.

01:00:20.233 --> 01:00:21.996
Can I lick the bowl?

01:00:32.145 --> 01:00:34.545
-Shaquinna.
-Yes.

01:00:35.081 --> 01:00:36.946
Your fever has broken.

01:00:39.419 --> 01:00:41.614
Thank you for standing by me.

01:00:42.255 --> 01:00:45.315
The person you should really thank
is Mr. Hunt.

01:00:47.527 --> 01:00:50.462
He risked his life
to bring back an eagle egg.

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:55.092
I could've just brought back the shell,
but nobody bothered to tell me that.

01:00:55.702 --> 01:00:57.465
Thank you, Mr. Hunt.

01:00:58.171 --> 01:01:02.540
Now we'll build canoes
and be on to the Pacific by the first thaw.

01:01:03.609 --> 01:01:05.907
I cannot begin to express my...

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:07.804
feelings.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.180
Don't be talking about no feelings.
I don't want to have to punch you.

01:01:14.387 --> 01:01:16.821
-Well, just the same....
-I’m serious.

01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:37.571
Good God.

01:01:41.314 --> 01:01:44.306
-What rare luck is this?
-What?

01:01:44.584 --> 01:01:47.849
Lewis and Clark,
and the damn fools are portaging.

01:01:55.428 --> 01:01:59.387
They're portaging because they think
the river is too dangerous up ahead.

01:01:59.499 --> 01:02:03.458
-I think we should do the same.
-I see no reason for concern.

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:08.036
Sir, there's an old saying,
''White water in the morning.''

01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:10.967
-Yes?
-That's it.

01:02:12.278 --> 01:02:16.146
Mr. Hunt, this is our chance
to overtake Lewis and Clark.

01:02:16.215 --> 01:02:17.682
Sure, we may overtake them...

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.651
but it ain't worth
risking the lives of the men.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.018
I assure you all will be fine.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:26.583
I hope to God you're right.

01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:52.277
Don't worry, men.

01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:56.754
According to my calculations, we have
less than a hundred yards of rapids ahead.

01:04:06.459 --> 01:04:09.587
My hat's off to you, sir. We made it.

01:04:11.464 --> 01:04:13.932
Men, we have overtaken Lewis and Clark.

01:04:14.534 --> 01:04:16.365
Gather up the pieces of the boat...

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:19.199
-and what's left of our supplies.
-No.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.639
I beg your pardon?

01:04:22.742 --> 01:04:25.575
You almost got us killed
just so you could be famous.

01:04:25.645 --> 01:04:28.842
Well, I ain't taking no more.
I’m quitting this expedition.

01:04:28.915 --> 01:04:32.009
-What of our partnership?
-Partnership?

01:04:32.184 --> 01:04:35.517
You didn't care nothing about
our partnership back there on the river.

01:04:35.588 --> 01:04:37.749
Well, I don't care nothing about it now.

01:04:37.823 --> 01:04:39.347
Who's coming with me?

01:04:39.425 --> 01:04:41.325
To hell with both of you.

01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:45.160
I’ve spent my entire life
trying to see the Pacific...

01:04:45.531 --> 01:04:48.056
and I’m going by myself.
Who's going with me?

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.625
Jonah, where do your loyalties lie?

01:04:51.704 --> 01:04:54.537
I’m your slave. Who do you think I’m with?

01:04:54.607 --> 01:04:57.508
-Thank you, Jonah.
-I’m going with Mr. Hunt.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:01.441
We're close. Only a few hundred miles.

01:05:01.781 --> 01:05:05.444
We will be the first.
Trust me, the worst is over.

01:05:05.518 --> 01:05:09.750
The worst will never be over.
Not with this precious dandy in charge.

01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:13.257
lf you want to live, come with me.

01:05:13.593 --> 01:05:16.926
Use your minds, men.
Think for yourselves.

01:05:17.597 --> 01:05:21.260
Or would you rather have Mr. Hunt
do your thinking for you?

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:24.633
My heavenly Father
does my thinking for me...

01:05:24.904 --> 01:05:28.271
and he thinks I'd be a damn fool
not to go with Hunt.

01:05:28.641 --> 01:05:31.474
No, Father. Wait.

01:05:34.981 --> 01:05:37.882
It is better to think for yourself.

01:05:38.884 --> 01:05:42.081
And I think
we should continue to the Pacific.

01:05:42.388 --> 01:05:44.253
Stout fellow, Bidwell.

01:05:44.323 --> 01:05:46.348
How can you say that, man?

01:05:46.826 --> 01:05:48.760
You've had it worse than all of us.

01:05:48.828 --> 01:05:52.662
Been mauled by a bear,
your ear bit off by a Frenchman.

01:05:52.732 --> 01:05:55.963
True enough, sir.
I have had my share of bad luck.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.629
But I cannot abandon Mr. Edwards now.

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:01.138
For he alone has dared to dream...

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.509
and now we are so very close...

01:06:04.577 --> 01:06:08.343
that I believe him when he says
the worst is over.

01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:15.580
When I said the worst was over,
perhaps I spoke too soon.

01:06:15.755 --> 01:06:17.780
But now, surely--

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:22.027
Bidwell, get down!

01:06:22.528 --> 01:06:24.928
I’m sorry, I was aiming for your head!

01:06:24.997 --> 01:06:26.021
You wait there!

01:06:26.098 --> 01:06:28.828
We'll be down in a moment
to capture you!

01:06:31.437 --> 01:06:34.497
I want them in their underthings
when they die.

01:06:35.307 --> 01:06:38.105
That makes it much worse,
don't you think?

01:06:40.046 --> 01:06:41.843
Prepare the gauntlet.

01:06:42.548 --> 01:06:44.379
-What?
-The gauntlet.

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:48.011
I’ve decided these two men will die
running the gauntlet.

01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:51.014
-The....
-The gauntlet!

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.081
All right. Calm yourself.

01:06:53.793 --> 01:06:56.227
You don't think I know
where there's a gambit?

01:06:56.295 --> 01:06:57.853
-Gumblit?
-Sanchez.

01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:58.919
Gauntlet.

01:06:59.298 --> 01:07:02.131
You and the Frenchman
prepare the gauntlet.

01:07:03.135 --> 01:07:06.571
I’m sorry we must cut short our fun,
my little kitten.

01:07:06.906 --> 01:07:10.205
lf you so much as lay a hand on me,
I will kill you.

01:07:10.743 --> 01:07:12.233
Take her away.

01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:29.892
Punch him.

01:07:33.232 --> 01:07:35.359
This is what it's all about.

01:07:42.108 --> 01:07:44.235
Burn your feet, you cowards.

01:07:49.081 --> 01:07:50.173
Wait.

01:07:56.222 --> 01:07:58.087
Look at the poofy one.

01:08:05.631 --> 01:08:07.599
Whose idea was the corn?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.035
And now they're getting away.
Hector, Ferdinand, after them !

01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:19.600
Go after them.

01:08:29.488 --> 01:08:30.613
Over there.

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.032
Hurry, they're almost here.

01:08:52.845 --> 01:08:55.040
-Oh, God.
-Come on.

01:09:03.255 --> 01:09:05.883
-Come on.
-Forget about me.

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:08.424
-You can do it.
-Save yourself.

01:09:09.295 --> 01:09:11.819
I’ll never forget this, Bartholomew.

01:09:16.202 --> 01:09:20.002
<i>And now we kill you, senor,
and take your head back to Hidalgo.</i>

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:22.063
But we do have one tiny favor
to ask of you.

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.167
Yes. You see, so often,
when we bring a head back to Hidalgo...

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:27.609
it has a grim sort of look of terror on it.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.640
It would really put us in good with Hidalgo
if you could smile as we kill you.

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:34.783
Go to hell.

01:09:38.023 --> 01:09:41.652
No. Did you see how ugly your face was
when you said that?

01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:46.761
-Say ''puppy.''
-Yes. Say ''puppy.''

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:49.823
You see, one cannot help but smile
when they say the word puppy.

01:09:49.902 --> 01:09:51.301
Say ''puppy.''

01:09:52.404 --> 01:09:54.668
Die, you Spanish bastards!

01:10:08.387 --> 01:10:10.480
Puppy, you sons of bitches.

01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:25.402
You know,
what you did back there for me...

01:10:26.405 --> 01:10:27.838
was real nice of you.

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:30.432
-It’s fine. Don't....
-You don't understand.

01:10:30.843 --> 01:10:34.973
It’s just that no one's ever done
nothing like that for me before.

01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:36.875
And....

01:10:41.921 --> 01:10:43.786
Thank you, that's all.

01:10:44.556 --> 01:10:46.080
Just thank you.

01:10:49.995 --> 01:10:52.190
Especially someone like you...

01:10:52.264 --> 01:10:55.097
who could've got himself killed so easy.

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:28.462
I think he's asleep.

01:11:28.934 --> 01:11:30.595
I think he's dead.

01:11:35.474 --> 01:11:37.374
I’m sorry I scared you.

01:11:37.943 --> 01:11:40.036
I was just resting my eyes.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:41.846
We need help.

01:11:42.614 --> 01:11:47.176
I will help. I am a proud warrior.

01:11:49.254 --> 01:11:53.520
-Wait, at least let us explain the situation.
-There's no time for that.

01:11:53.592 --> 01:11:57.585
Look, our men are being held captive
by at least 20 conquistadors.

01:11:57.663 --> 01:12:00.757
Are there others in your tribe
that can help us?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.299
Perhaps men a bit younger than yourself?

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.128
Yes.

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:13.241
I am going to cut this woman's hair off.

01:12:13.846 --> 01:12:15.643
Anybody want to guess why?

01:12:15.714 --> 01:12:18.581
-To entertain us?
-No.

01:12:18.984 --> 01:12:22.044
-Because she asked you to?
-No.

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:23.615
I know!

01:12:24.323 --> 01:12:28.316
Because her hair is more beautiful
than yours, and you're jealous.

01:12:28.827 --> 01:12:29.851
No.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:34.695
I am going to cut her hair off
because it's not as beautiful as mine.

01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:39.637
Because, even if she won't admit it,
she's thinking:

01:12:39.705 --> 01:12:43.664
''Why should I even bother to have hair
when he's got hair like that.''

01:12:44.009 --> 01:12:46.705
-You understand?
-No, not really.

01:12:48.013 --> 01:12:49.537
I don't get it.

01:12:50.049 --> 01:12:53.246
Who cares?
I’m going to skin you all alive anyway.

01:12:53.886 --> 01:12:56.013
-Prepare her.
-Prepare her.

01:12:58.424 --> 01:13:02.520
You indicated that the braves you had
summoned were younger than you?

01:13:02.594 --> 01:13:06.655
They are.
Running Puma is two years younger.

01:13:07.533 --> 01:13:10.024
Strong Like Mountain is....

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:12.770
-Four.
-Four years younger.

01:13:13.672 --> 01:13:17.301
We appreciate you showing up and all,
but...

01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:22.110
we're going to probably just do this alone.

01:13:22.881 --> 01:13:24.906
At the moment of battle...

01:13:25.451 --> 01:13:30.047
our spirits will soar
and give us the strength...

01:13:31.423 --> 01:13:32.685
to fight.

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:40.728
This is the way we must travel.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:44.329
This way,
we save our strength for the battle.

01:13:45.537 --> 01:13:48.335
-Stop.
-What now?

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:51.499
Running Puma has to go back
behind tree again.

01:13:52.044 --> 01:13:53.375
I’m sorry.

01:13:56.348 --> 01:13:59.806
All right, look. This is the last time.

01:14:00.552 --> 01:14:04.613
Anyone else has to go, do it now.
I ain't stopping again.

01:14:15.501 --> 01:14:18.766
I don't see
how these Indians are going to help us.

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:24.900
Perhaps we need not rely on them to fight.
Perhaps I can bluff Hidalgo using my wits.

01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:30.537
This is getting much too difficult.

01:14:31.183 --> 01:14:33.674
We can finish brushing her hair
after she's dead.

01:14:33.752 --> 01:14:35.720
<i>Stop right there, senor.</i>

01:14:36.855 --> 01:14:40.052
This has gone too far.
You must release Shaquinna.

01:14:41.326 --> 01:14:43.351
Such arrogance!

01:14:44.196 --> 01:14:48.428
You are surrounded by an army of
Indian braves, who, on my command...

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:53.334
will descend upon you with all the fury
of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

01:14:53.839 --> 01:14:56.171
Hell, we got more than four.

01:14:56.642 --> 01:15:01.545
And they got names like Soaring Eagle,
Strong Like Mountain...

01:15:04.116 --> 01:15:05.674
and others, too.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:08.720
Well, where are these braves?
Show them to me.

01:15:08.987 --> 01:15:10.784
Show them to me, too.

01:15:12.191 --> 01:15:14.182
I am one of these braves.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.522
And I am one of these braves.

01:15:18.197 --> 01:15:20.392
I am one of these braves.

01:15:26.205 --> 01:15:28.002
That's quite an army!

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:30.207
Why should we fight?

01:15:30.275 --> 01:15:33.836
Maybe if we wait a couple of hours
they'll die of old age.

01:16:28.066 --> 01:16:30.864
And you thought I couldn't escape you?

01:16:32.738 --> 01:16:33.727
You....

01:16:34.473 --> 01:16:38.409
Here's an idea.
You take off running into the woods...

01:16:38.543 --> 01:16:42.274
and I try to count to three
before I put another hole...

01:16:42.381 --> 01:16:45.214
in your hairy French ass!

01:16:48.553 --> 01:16:51.647
''Hairy French ass.'' You had me going.

01:16:51.723 --> 01:16:55.124
''And I’ll put a big hole
in your hairy French ass.'' Man, you--

01:17:14.012 --> 01:17:17.778
<i>Hey, senor! Look what I have.</i>

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:20.312
Your woman!

01:17:23.021 --> 01:17:25.148
-I’ll take care of this.
-No.

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:27.918
You've done enough, Bartholomew!

01:17:27.993 --> 01:17:29.620
-Leslie!
-Come on!

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:33.694
It’s time for me to fight my own battles.

01:17:38.503 --> 01:17:40.095
Hidalgo is mine.

01:18:03.795 --> 01:18:07.822
Sir, you are a coward.
You seized a woman and ran.

01:18:09.167 --> 01:18:11.965
And now I’m going to teach you a lesson.

01:18:25.217 --> 01:18:27.811
Either you're brave or you're stupid.

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:32.119
Perhaps there's not much difference
between the two.

01:18:44.269 --> 01:18:45.759
You're a smart man.

01:18:45.837 --> 01:18:49.500
After I kill you, I’ll have to look
at your brain to see if it's different...

01:18:49.574 --> 01:18:52.634
from, you know,
other brains I might have seen.

01:19:02.254 --> 01:19:03.949
Good God!

01:19:07.793 --> 01:19:09.385
Hello, baldy!

01:19:14.132 --> 01:19:15.531
You shut up!

01:19:33.718 --> 01:19:36.812
<i>Now you've seen me as I truly am, senor.</i>

01:19:37.823 --> 01:19:40.485
I’m just a bald, fat man...

01:19:41.359 --> 01:19:43.554
begging for your mercy.

01:19:45.564 --> 01:19:48.533
Edwards, we've just seen Lewis and Clark.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.194
They're a mile away,
and they're headed for the ocean.

01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:55.706
My God! Well, come on, then.
We can still beat them !

01:19:58.143 --> 01:19:59.508
<i>Hey, senor!</i>

01:19:59.644 --> 01:20:03.876
This business with my wig,
it's just between you and me.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.436
Oh, my God!

01:20:39.184 --> 01:20:40.515
We did it.

01:20:43.955 --> 01:20:45.684
Not yet, we haven't.

01:20:45.957 --> 01:20:48.755
They're going to get to the ocean
before us.

01:20:48.827 --> 01:20:52.456
The only way to beat them
is straight down that rock face.

01:20:52.864 --> 01:20:55.458
Well, then, as leader of this expedition...

01:20:57.035 --> 01:20:59.560
I should be the one that climbs down.

01:20:59.638 --> 01:21:00.627
Leslie.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:06.301
You ain't going down there.
You'll be killed. I should go.

01:21:06.611 --> 01:21:07.873
Nonsense.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.305
Then this is for your own damn good.

01:21:14.786 --> 01:21:17.448
How was that for my own damn good?

01:21:17.989 --> 01:21:21.447
Sorry. The punch was supposed
to knock you out.

01:21:22.227 --> 01:21:25.856
Let's see here. This here ought to do it.

01:21:29.834 --> 01:21:34.237
What the hell are you doing? Go!
He's going to go.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.299
Pratt.

01:21:39.778 --> 01:21:41.746
Give me the flag.

01:22:03.935 --> 01:22:05.266
Good luck.

01:22:33.131 --> 01:22:34.359
Oh, God!

01:22:47.445 --> 01:22:49.436
Oh, no.

01:23:01.026 --> 01:23:03.517
Oh, God! No!

01:23:08.199 --> 01:23:09.188
Oh, God!

01:23:19.144 --> 01:23:21.544
Oh, God! No!

01:23:21.946 --> 01:23:25.143
Please, bird, don't hurt me.

01:23:25.216 --> 01:23:28.652
You put me on the ground,
you damn, dirty bird!

01:23:46.071 --> 01:23:47.436
Oh, my God!

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.538
Hunt! You did it!

01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:27.303
We all did it!

01:24:31.783 --> 01:24:34.115
Wait. How did you get down here?

01:24:35.019 --> 01:24:37.749
We found an Indian trail.

01:24:37.956 --> 01:24:39.423
It was very nice.

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.982
Yes, they even carved little steps.

01:24:44.062 --> 01:24:48.192
Shame we didn't take another minute
or two to look around up there.

01:24:48.399 --> 01:24:49.866
Leslie, look!

01:24:53.538 --> 01:24:55.130
You're too late!

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.564
We beat you!

01:24:57.642 --> 01:25:00.805
Yeah! Go home, losers!

01:25:11.389 --> 01:25:15.485
Men, we're the first
to conquer this great continent.

01:25:23.768 --> 01:25:25.759
-Time to head home.
-Yeah.

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:28.229
But why does it have to end here?

01:25:28.306 --> 01:25:31.469
-What are you talking about?
-I’m talking about exploring!

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:33.033
Look here, men.

01:25:33.111 --> 01:25:36.478
We've beaten this continent.
What say we try another?

01:25:36.748 --> 01:25:41.685
We could travel north to the Bering Strait,
a bridge of land and ice that leads to Asia.

01:25:42.086 --> 01:25:43.849
We could walk there.

01:25:44.422 --> 01:25:46.447
Walk to Asia.

01:25:47.692 --> 01:25:49.023
I like it.

01:25:49.594 --> 01:25:51.357
And why stop there?

01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:53.620
We could go on to Europe.

01:25:54.365 --> 01:25:58.199
Edwards and Hunt,
the first Americans to walk to Europe.

01:26:00.672 --> 01:26:02.765
The food alone is worth the trip.

01:26:02.841 --> 01:26:03.865
The food, sir.

01:26:03.942 --> 01:26:07.844
This time, next Christmas,
we'll be sipping champagne in Paris!

01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:02.339
English
