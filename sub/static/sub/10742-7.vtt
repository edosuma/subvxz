             [♪♪♪]

22:12.398 --> 22:14.465
               You have
     a perfect trajectory, Tony.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.765
Glad to hear it.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.438
  We're on auxiliary temp.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.973
                GEORGE:
       Everything is green here.

22:30.882 --> 22:33.150
      Tony, are you ready
        to hit the deck?

22:33.185 --> 22:35.486
       As ready as I'll ever be.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.104
     I'm opening the hatch.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.709
                     TONY:
                 Hatch is open.
               I'm stepping out.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.944
        I'm heading for
     the wild blue yonder.

23:07.286 --> 23:08.485
  Check your tether line.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.488
                   GEORGE:
                Tether clear.
             Easy does it, Tony.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.530
         Tony's out of the ship.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.464
      All systems normal.

             [♪♪♪]

23:23.368 --> 23:26.136
         I've left the ship.
             I'm floating.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.488
             ROGER:
         <i> Any reaction?</i>

23:44.524 --> 23:46.891
             TONY:
       <i> Are you kidding?</i>
        <i> It feels great!</i>

24:16.422 --> 24:18.321
Good evening, master.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.591
Did thou see the beautiful star
          over there?

24:21.894 --> 24:24.028
<i> Star light, star bright</i>
<i> First star I see tonight</i>

24:24.063 --> 24:25.195
<i> Wish I may, wish I might</i>

24:25.230 --> 24:26.964
  <i> Wish this wish</i>
<i> Comes true tonight</i>
