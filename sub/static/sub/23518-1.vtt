WEBVTT

00:42.457 --> 00:44.497
Wake up, sleeping head.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.874
We are here.
- Stop, Caroline.

00:50.966 --> 00:53.837
Jess.
Honey.

00:54.011 --> 00:55.813
It's time to wake up.

00:57.764 --> 01:01.596
Sorry, Mrs. Biven.
I thought it was Caroline.

01:05.856 --> 01:09.272
Are we there?
- Yes, we are here.

01:12.946 --> 01:14.738
Thanks for the elevator, Mrs Biven.

01:14.907 --> 01:17.362
You're awesome.
- Well done, Jess.

01:17.534 --> 01:18.732
Wait.

01:18.911 --> 01:22.114
What?
- Do you have your tickets?

01:22.289 --> 01:23.341
Money?

01:34.593 --> 01:39.171
Mom, do not forget that I am at the festival
switch off my phone ...

01:39.348 --> 01:41.340
... because there is no range there.

01:41.517 --> 01:45.051
But I'll call you on the way back.
- Do you promise?

01:46.230 --> 01:47.475
I promise.

01:48.607 --> 01:51.608
Wait now.
- What?

01:51.777 --> 01:53.900
Do not you forget something?

01:54.071 --> 01:56.906
No, I'm pretty sure I have everything.

02:04.832 --> 02:07.287
I'm not going to a war zone.

02:10.419 --> 02:12.579
I'll see you again after the weekend.

02:19.721 --> 02:20.966
I love you.

02:22.266 --> 02:23.843
I also from you.

02:24.017 --> 02:26.687
Hello, thanks again.

02:26.854 --> 02:30.554
Watch out for Caroline.
- No worries. I will do that.

02:30.732 --> 02:32.392
Have fun, girls.

02:34.444 --> 02:39.071
The bus from Merced to Lake Tahoe ...
- Go now.

02:39.241 --> 02:40.700
... leaves in ten minutes.

02:40.868 --> 02:44.486
How do you manage it?
- I have no choice.

02:44.663 --> 02:48.412
I am glad that I am not an only child.
I could not handle all that attention.

02:48.584 --> 02:52.712
Believe me, if I may choose it,
then I would have had brothers and sisters.

02:54.339 --> 02:57.543
She has to find a hobby.
- Indeed.

02:58.802 --> 03:00.213
PAY TERMINAL

03:15.777 --> 03:18.447
NORTH
LAKE TAHOE

03:18.614 --> 03:21.899
What are you doing?
- Come back.

03:22.075 --> 03:25.160
Why are you no longer occupied with it?

03:27.080 --> 03:28.824
Attention, passengers.

03:29.958 --> 03:33.956
This is the last call
for passengers going to Lake Tahoe.

03:34.129 --> 03:36.371
The bus leaves in a few minutes.

03:36.548 --> 03:40.498
What are you doing?
- I'm sure they're in it.

03:40.677 --> 03:42.836
You said you were last night
had printed out.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.551
Look in the side box.

03:49.186 --> 03:50.431
Give me to me.

03:52.064 --> 03:56.275
Attention, please. All passengers
going to the music festival ...

03:56.443 --> 03:59.859
... do not forget to keep your bus ticket
for extras there.

04:04.034 --> 04:06.323
What?
- Surprise.

04:06.495 --> 04:08.203
There are no bus tickets.

04:09.289 --> 04:11.199
How do we get there?
- Calm down.

04:11.375 --> 04:15.040
I do have the festival tickets.

04:15.212 --> 04:16.706
You see?

04:16.880 --> 04:21.257
Okay, let's buy bus tickets.
- No, wait a minute.

04:21.426 --> 04:26.088
I have a lift
arranged for the festival.

04:28.517 --> 04:30.391
Calm down.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.933
Felicia and Adam come to pick us up.

04:33.105 --> 04:36.225
They're here in five minutes.

04:38.944 --> 04:43.653
What? You know that I belong to my mother
can not ride with them.

04:43.824 --> 04:47.869
I could not tell her.
- You could have told me.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.829
The less you know, the better.

04:59.715 --> 05:02.716
I thought you would be surprised.

05:04.469 --> 05:08.514
Tell me, is not that much more fun?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.347
DO NOT STOP

06:13.163 --> 06:14.492
What did they say?

06:16.416 --> 06:17.827
What did they say?

06:21.213 --> 06:22.244
Let me see.

06:26.510 --> 06:27.838
What then?

06:35.686 --> 06:36.884
Sorry.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.618
Come on.

06:53.787 --> 06:55.910
Let's arrange an elevator.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.376
Come.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.877
Hello, stupid idiot.
- I did not expect people on the road.

07:55.057 --> 07:58.177
You almost killed us.
- Sorry.

07:58.352 --> 08:01.388
What are you doing here?
Do you need a lift?

08:01.563 --> 08:04.434
They give us a lift.
- No, call your mother.

08:04.608 --> 08:08.107
Then look at them.
They are harmless.

08:08.278 --> 08:09.737
You want to have fun?

08:10.989 --> 08:12.152
Yes.
- Beautiful.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.407
I'm Fred.
This charming man is Thomas.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.444
Do you know...

09:15.387 --> 09:17.427
He's pretty nice.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.520
Look at you.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.569
He finds you ...

09:35.365 --> 09:37.405
...very nice.

09:38.785 --> 09:39.948
Perhaps.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.998
Are you blind sometimes?

09:48.462 --> 09:51.629
I do not know.
I think so.

10:04.144 --> 10:07.229
You always know how to seduce boys.

10:07.397 --> 10:09.224
What do you mean?

10:10.859 --> 10:12.057
Nothing.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.145
Whatever.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.952
THANK YOU

10:42.808 --> 10:43.922
Do you want chips?

10:48.689 --> 10:49.768
Are you okay?

10:51.859 --> 10:55.524
Apart from a detour that lasts three hours?
Genius idea, by the way.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.024
It's going great.

10:57.197 --> 11:00.649
We have a great car
and two tasty women.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.617
What more do we want?

11:04.580 --> 11:05.640
I am okay.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.916
Are you ready for it?
- Yes, I'm ready.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.624
You look nice.

11:19.469 --> 11:20.750
Please.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.808
Potato chips.
- I want to see your identity card.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.733
The energy drinks are on offer.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.732
We do not have to.
- Are you sure?

11:40.908 --> 11:43.066
The orange juice flavor
is for half the price.

11:43.243 --> 11:45.035
We do not need anything.
- Unfortunately...

11:45.204 --> 11:47.742
Guest, did he say that we do not need anything?

11:51.376 --> 11:52.657
That is 25.50.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.042
Understood, central.
We are going to that 10-12.

11:59.259 --> 12:00.422
Keep the change.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.470
Are you sure?

12:04.598 --> 12:05.761
Please.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.054
Day, agents.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.568
LAW ENFORCEMENT

13:07.411 --> 13:09.949
All units are advised ...

13:20.215 --> 13:22.124
It will be fine.
Do not worry.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.228
You are beautiful.
- Thanks.

14:22.402 --> 14:24.194
You may also be there.

14:43.006 --> 14:44.999
Take it easy.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.303
We are in no hurry.

14:56.728 --> 15:00.678
I thought you would like this.
- Yes.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.352
But not here.

15:02.526 --> 15:07.651
When we have arrived,
then we can isolate ourselves.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.075
Do not be stupid.

15:15.455 --> 15:19.287
I told you to stop.
- Do not be shy.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.323
You are going to enjoy it.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.590
Leave me alone.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.544
Get rid of her.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.359
Jess, wake up.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.944
Please wake up.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.954
Caroline, wake up.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.291
Are you okay?

20:22.429 --> 20:25.549
I can not feel my legs.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.510
They tingle up to halfway my thigh.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.813
I'm afraid.

20:33.982 --> 20:37.565
Someone has probably already seen us
and will get help for us.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.729
And what if nobody has seen us?

20:42.366 --> 20:43.860
Someone will come.

20:45.077 --> 20:49.371
I promise you that someone will come.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.960
Can you release my belt?

21:03.136 --> 21:04.547
Let's see.

21:34.918 --> 21:35.997
Over there.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.747
Watch out, Jess, your arms.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.807
He is stuck.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.560
Everywhere there is blood and glass.

22:27.846 --> 22:31.215
I will not keep this attitude for long.

22:33.435 --> 22:37.896
Jess, we have to leave here as soon as possible,
What else...

22:38.982 --> 22:41.438
I do not know if I have my legs
can still move.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.567
How is he doing?

22:48.659 --> 22:50.153
And where is Fred?

22:55.249 --> 22:56.328
I do not know.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.532
I think he was thrown out the window.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.882
Try to wake up Thomas.

23:10.848 --> 23:11.962
Is it with him?

23:14.685 --> 23:15.716
I do not know.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.556
I think so.

23:23.154 --> 23:25.632
I do not know
what I am doing now.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.531
Wait a second.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.360
He is very warm.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.992
If he was dead,
then he would feel cold.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.667
Okay, he's breathing?

23:41.837 --> 23:45.502
That is beautiful.
He is therefore unconscious.

23:46.758 --> 23:47.957
Which is good.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.592
Wait a second.

24:10.491 --> 24:11.985
I will not break the window.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.792
That's mine too.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.901
I think I see someone.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.154
But I am not sure.

24:51.281 --> 24:54.531
Is it Fred?
- I do not know. Perhaps.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.493
I try to open it further.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.122
Stupid idiot.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.744
This is all his fault.

25:21.687 --> 25:22.801
What is that?

25:25.149 --> 25:26.228
That is my...

25:28.277 --> 25:30.068
That's my phone.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.810
Wait, where is that?

25:37.661 --> 25:39.203
He is next to you.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.919
That's my mother.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.874
She's probably worried,
because I have not called yet.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.922
You can access it from here.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.966
I can not reach it.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.272
Is everything alright?

26:17.743 --> 26:19.118
Yes it's going well.

26:26.627 --> 26:27.706
Fast.

26:50.484 --> 26:51.943
Good idea.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.363
Let me give it a try.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.362
Come on, you got it.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.285
Another small piece.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.840
He does not fit through the window.

27:16.426 --> 27:17.506
It will work.

27:22.266 --> 27:24.935
Call the police.
- There is a callback button.

27:25.102 --> 27:28.056
What are you doing?
- I'll call my mother back.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.388
She will help us.
- No.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.769
Mom, help us.
We had an accident.

27:33.944 --> 27:37.942
We can not get out.
- The car is upside down.

27:38.115 --> 27:42.113
Mom, hello?
- Hi, I can not be reached now.

27:42.286 --> 27:46.034
It's her voicemail.
- Leave a message.

27:46.206 --> 27:49.124
Mom, you're talking to Caroline.

27:50.210 --> 27:54.125
We had an accident.
The car is upside down. We are stuck.

27:54.298 --> 27:57.749
In a black sports car.
Please.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.085
Help us.

28:00.305 --> 28:01.637
BATTERY LOW EMPTY

28:06.143 --> 28:09.179
She knows we are in danger.
She will come.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.845
How?
She does not even know where we are.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.515
But she knows ...
- We had our chance.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.436
But you have lost it.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.937
Is this all my fault?

28:23.911 --> 28:25.619
What would you have done?

28:25.787 --> 28:30.912
I would have called the police.
- My mother will do that.

28:31.084 --> 28:34.251
If she knew where we are ...

28:35.464 --> 28:39.129
Do not forget
that I did not want to get into this car.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.175
Wait.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.048
Do you have a better idea?

28:47.226 --> 28:53.311
As directors I have
not a good first impression of them.

28:53.482 --> 28:58.523
Then we will wait in the cold
until a scary car passes by?

28:58.695 --> 29:01.068
No, call your mother.

29:01.240 --> 29:05.451
Then look at them.
They are harmless.

29:05.619 --> 29:08.573
Do you promise?
- Yes.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.823
I promise.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.540
Do you think I had anticipated an accident?

29:17.714 --> 29:20.419
Do you think I knew?
that you were going to feast with him?

29:23.971 --> 29:25.714
I should have known.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.846
You always do that with boys.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.687
That is not what I wanted from him.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.401
Whatever.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.727
Thomas, wake up.

30:32.414 --> 30:36.163
Your inhaler.
Of course. I'll take that for you.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.872
You had him with you?
He must be here somewhere.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.009
Caroline, keep up.
I'll find it.

30:54.603 --> 30:55.848
What is it?

31:08.283 --> 31:11.237
"Open me up."

31:20.754 --> 31:23.245
No I can not.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.048
Hold on.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.852
I do not know what to do.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.176
Jess, I'm sorry ...

32:57.351 --> 32:59.142
... of what I just said.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.112
My leg.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.786
Fred, is that you?

33:18.956 --> 33:21.826
Yes, I was wounded.
- Is that Fred?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.163
I do not see anything.

33:24.461 --> 33:27.581
Ask if he can move.
- Can you move?

33:27.756 --> 33:31.505
No that does not work. There is a branch.
- You have to move.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.965
I need help.
- You must free us.

33:34.137 --> 33:39.642
You have to help us. We can not get out.
We have tried everything. Nothing works.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.515
I can not move.
My leg is fucked.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.392
This is all his fault.
We should never have trusted him.

33:47.568 --> 33:51.435
We are really sorry.
We will make it up with you.

33:51.613 --> 33:56.774
It does not matter where you are
must go. We will bring you.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.695
We owe that to you.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.571
Are you okay with that?

34:22.811 --> 34:24.436
Look in this suitcase.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.764
Maybe there are tools in it.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.862
Search everywhere.

35:23.038 --> 35:25.909
Maybe you can open the door
opening from the outside.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.794
I can do little from here
to help you.

35:43.684 --> 35:46.471
Are the windows sometimes bulletproof?

36:51.084 --> 36:54.418
Fred, are you okay?

36:55.923 --> 36:59.089
Answer.
- Yes I'm fine.

36:59.259 --> 37:02.177
I have been very lucky.

37:03.555 --> 37:07.339
Is Thomas all right?
- I do not know.

37:07.518 --> 37:09.226
I do not think he was injured.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.304
At least I do not see anything.

37:13.941 --> 37:16.610
He still breathes, but he is unconscious.

37:17.778 --> 37:21.194
Somebody is probably looking for us.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.942
Nobody is looking for us.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.121
It will take days for someone
will find us.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.618
We are far away from everything.
- But my mother ...

37:35.796 --> 37:38.963
Your mother will be there tomorrow
find out that we are in the nests.

37:39.132 --> 37:41.884
Then she will not know where we are yet.

37:43.220 --> 37:47.549
Someone will come.
- When?

37:47.724 --> 37:49.005
I do not know.
- Never.

37:50.435 --> 37:53.472
What did you say?
- Never.

37:53.647 --> 37:54.678
No one...

37:55.774 --> 37:57.850
Nobody can find us here.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.770
Why are you saying that?

38:00.904 --> 38:04.949
The car is not ours.
- It's Thomas's car.

38:05.117 --> 38:09.578
He is not from Thomas.
- The car is from his parents.

38:11.415 --> 38:15.744
Why are you laughing at us?
- Did you think we were spoiled and rich?

38:15.919 --> 38:20.996
Yes, we thought so.
- We are not spoiled. We work.

38:21.175 --> 38:25.089
Where do you work?
- There where money can be made.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.764
Sometimes in hotels.
Usually in buildings.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.934
Thomas looks at images
and I park cars.

38:33.103 --> 38:36.187
As a guard and parking aid.
Boring.

38:37.274 --> 38:39.183
But it was different the last time.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.561
We worked in the day shift.

38:42.688 --> 38:46.281
We started at nine o'clock and at six o'clock
We left. Same thing every day.

38:46.408 --> 38:50.987
The working hours were bad. I had nothing
to do except check packages.

38:51.163 --> 38:54.033
It went on all day,
but I thought mostly after ...

38:54.208 --> 38:57.244
... while Thomas all the time
watched surveillance footage.

38:57.419 --> 39:00.788
We've been working there for a few weeks,
so we knew the place.

39:00.964 --> 39:03.634
Every Friday at 5.15 pm ...

39:03.800 --> 39:07.584
... I parked a car on Monday
going abroad.

39:07.763 --> 39:12.757
And every Monday at 9.50 am
the car was picked up.

39:54.268 --> 39:57.767
Sometimes, to get something big,
you have to think small.

40:32.764 --> 40:38.554
We would take the car for a weekend
and bring the car back ...

40:38.729 --> 40:40.971
... without anyone finding out.

40:48.071 --> 40:49.779
It was perfect.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.948
What did you get in your head?
Why did you do that?

40:55.120 --> 40:58.038
Why not?
- Because it's stealing.

40:58.207 --> 40:59.915
We would bring him back.

41:00.083 --> 41:01.791
Really?
In this state?

41:01.960 --> 41:04.747
You have a stolen car
driven into practice.

41:04.922 --> 41:06.961
Do you think we wanted this?

41:08.050 --> 41:11.170
It has happened.

41:11.345 --> 41:13.918
The fact that we can die,
is your fault.

41:14.097 --> 41:17.632
I offer my sincere apologies.
Really.

41:17.810 --> 41:23.314
But we will go through your voice
die faster. So keep your mouth shut.

41:23.482 --> 41:26.436
There is little that we can do now.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.021
Get the kler.

41:31.281 --> 41:33.274
Fall dead.

42:03.105 --> 42:04.765
I should have died.

42:09.820 --> 42:11.729
When those two almost overturned me ...

42:13.448 --> 42:14.693
... I should have died.

42:16.493 --> 42:17.987
Do not be stupid.

42:26.962 --> 42:28.207
Just step in.

42:30.340 --> 42:32.214
You still need a lift?

42:38.432 --> 42:40.424
Wait.
- Sad, is not it?

42:41.894 --> 42:45.726
I have escaped death.
- They give us a lift.

42:45.898 --> 42:47.937
But now I am even more desirous of death.

42:49.318 --> 42:51.725
I read about that.
- Oh yeah?

42:56.283 --> 42:59.450
I think I know what you mean.

42:59.620 --> 43:02.537
That is a philosophy of the Maya.

43:03.624 --> 43:04.869
What do they call that?

43:08.170 --> 43:10.162
I have forgotten the name.

43:13.592 --> 43:18.088
That is called <i> Final Destination? </ I></i>

43:18.263 --> 43:22.925
Or is this the second, third, fourth
or fifth part?

43:44.873 --> 43:46.154
Jess, do you want ...

43:48.877 --> 43:51.997
Would you like to sit behind my chair
to come from?

44:07.729 --> 44:09.971
Loosen the belt.

44:11.441 --> 44:14.193
Pull this if you succeed.

44:14.361 --> 44:17.695
Furthermore, it does not work.
- That has to be.

44:17.865 --> 44:21.198
Try the button again.
Use the pencil.

44:29.960 --> 44:31.205
What is going on?

44:37.217 --> 44:40.669
Damn, my leg.
That is still a problem.

44:40.846 --> 44:44.594
I could no longer maintain that attitude.

44:44.766 --> 44:47.055
Is she injured?
- Yes.

44:52.524 --> 44:54.433
Where is the vodka bottle?

44:55.569 --> 44:56.944
Look under the chair.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.661
My leg. Hurry up.
- Hold on.

45:20.677 --> 45:23.085
If we get out of here ...

45:23.263 --> 45:25.885
... and you can choose everything
whatever you want ...

45:26.975 --> 45:28.220
... what would you like?

45:30.896 --> 45:32.935
I do not know.
I think...

45:33.106 --> 45:34.649
I think I will ...

45:36.276 --> 45:40.060
... would like a cheeseburger.
And Ryan Gosling.

45:42.783 --> 45:47.077
A thing.
You have to choose one thing.

45:47.246 --> 45:50.911
What do you choose?
A cheeseburger or Ryan Gosling?

45:52.251 --> 45:55.417
That's difficult.
I do not know.

45:56.588 --> 45:59.874
I think if I have one thing
should choose ...

46:00.968 --> 46:04.337
... that it would be Ryan Gosling.

46:04.513 --> 46:07.300
I would be right from the cheeseburger
to regret.

46:10.352 --> 46:11.894
I would choose Brad Pitt.

46:13.147 --> 46:14.475
Brad Pitt?
Are you serious?

46:15.691 --> 46:20.602
In <i> Fight Club.
- Fight Club? </ I> Then you are no chance.</i>

46:20.779 --> 46:26.699
Okay then.
Then I would choose Angelina Jolie.

46:28.036 --> 46:30.610
She comes most in the neighborhood
from Brad Pitt.

46:31.748 --> 46:33.622
How stupid you are.

47:08.619 --> 47:10.196
What are you doing?

47:23.342 --> 47:25.797
I want to wake up Thomas with the vodka.

47:36.522 --> 47:37.850
Wake up, Thomas.

47:40.609 --> 47:41.772
He moved.

47:43.737 --> 47:44.900
Is he awake?

47:53.163 --> 47:56.034
'Give him a kick.'
That worked in <i> Inception. </ I></i>

47:57.334 --> 47:58.745
It worked well.

48:14.268 --> 48:17.269
Thomas, you have to get us out of this.
We are stuck.

48:17.437 --> 48:20.189
The car.
Damn it, the car.

48:20.357 --> 48:24.022
Forget the car. It has been destroyed.
We have to get out.

48:26.155 --> 48:28.562
I do not want to go to jail.
- Or worse.

48:28.740 --> 48:31.907
We're going to die
if you do not take us away here.

48:32.077 --> 48:34.912
Where is Fred?
Where is he?

48:35.080 --> 48:37.405
Did he run away?
- No.

48:37.583 --> 48:41.367
He's outside.
I think he is unconscious now.

48:45.674 --> 48:47.133
My hand.

48:48.218 --> 48:52.346
My hand.
- We tried everything.

48:52.514 --> 48:54.388
The car is just Fort Knox.

48:56.810 --> 48:59.127
There is probably something else in the car.

49:00.481 --> 49:04.727
This is my father's car.
- Do not get out of your neck.

49:04.902 --> 49:08.734
We know the story.
We know that the car has been stolen.

49:08.906 --> 49:10.483
Stupid idiot.

49:37.184 --> 49:38.299
What is that?

49:39.770 --> 49:41.347
I do not know.

49:43.023 --> 49:44.648
Beep.
- Hey?

49:44.817 --> 49:47.272
It just squeaked.
- Are you sure?

49:47.444 --> 49:50.647
I'm sure it squeaked.
- What does that mean?

49:50.823 --> 49:54.238
I really do not know that.
- What is it? Tell.

49:54.409 --> 49:56.449
First important things.

49:56.620 --> 49:58.743
We have to get out of here.

50:39.538 --> 50:43.488
Thomas, please help us.
Remove the branches.

51:11.904 --> 51:15.540
I need something to counter that cable
hold. Otherwise I can not pass by.

51:15.667 --> 51:17.655
Something?
- What does he need?

51:17.826 --> 51:19.486
Something to ...

51:24.249 --> 51:25.328
Got you.

51:26.877 --> 51:28.953
You have to slide this through the window.

51:38.555 --> 51:40.678
What should I do with this?

51:40.849 --> 51:44.633
What should he do with that?
- No idea.

51:51.360 --> 51:54.776
What do you do when you are alone in the wild?

51:54.947 --> 51:59.774
Think.

51:59.952 --> 52:02.324
Liam Neeson, what would you do?

52:02.496 --> 52:04.868
Do not play games with me.
Say something to me.

52:07.042 --> 52:09.960
You would survive, would not you?

52:10.128 --> 52:13.618
You would find the guy that the cable
has made and would kill him.

52:14.132 --> 52:15.212
And his family.

52:36.530 --> 52:38.154
What is going on?

52:38.323 --> 52:40.530
I can not see anything.

52:43.537 --> 52:47.404
What is Thomas doing?
- I think he's helping Fred.

52:50.460 --> 52:53.995
What are you doing?
- I'm trying to see what happens.

53:14.818 --> 53:17.855
Come on, buddy.

53:25.496 --> 53:27.618
I have such a pain.

53:27.789 --> 53:29.912
Can you move?

53:30.083 --> 53:32.041
No, I can not move.

53:32.211 --> 53:34.452
Try to move your legs.
Come on.

53:35.839 --> 53:40.051
We had an accident.
- I know that.

53:41.970 --> 53:43.299
What about the girls?

53:45.724 --> 53:48.511
They will save themselves.
- No, we have to free them.

53:48.685 --> 53:51.722
First I have to take care of you.
- The girls...

53:51.897 --> 53:53.391
Jess.
- Wait.

53:53.565 --> 53:55.190
Save us.

53:56.276 --> 53:59.610
Help us.
- Hold on.

54:03.033 --> 54:06.865
This is going to hurt, but I have no choice.
- Just do it.

54:07.037 --> 54:08.152
Just do it.

54:45.075 --> 54:46.653
I think they're leaving.

54:49.580 --> 54:52.284
They can not do that.

54:52.457 --> 54:57.203
We have to get out of here as soon as possible.
- No. The girls then?

54:57.379 --> 54:59.288
They know too much.
They will betray us.

54:59.464 --> 55:01.623
We have to save them.
- That is not possible.

55:01.800 --> 55:04.967
We do not have much time.
- We can not leave them in that car.

55:05.137 --> 55:07.710
Come with me.
- No.

55:07.837 --> 55:09.823
If we leave them in the car, they will die.

55:09.950 --> 55:12.643
Someone will come and get them.
- When?

55:12.811 --> 55:16.145
I do not know.
- Look at the car.

55:17.274 --> 55:18.602
Can you see that?

55:19.568 --> 55:22.273
If we do not help them,
then they will die.

55:22.446 --> 55:24.818
What will happen to us?

55:24.945 --> 55:26.947
We help them out of the car
and go off.

55:28.035 --> 55:29.944
What are you a stupid ...

55:30.120 --> 55:31.495
What am I then?

55:32.789 --> 55:33.952
Tell.

55:35.042 --> 55:36.204
Well?

55:38.253 --> 55:39.844
You're a stupid idiot.

55:40.547 --> 55:42.089
This is all your fault.

55:43.008 --> 55:45.050
You offered those girls a lift.

55:45.177 --> 55:48.427
I knew it was asking for problems,
when they got in the car.

55:48.597 --> 55:52.642
Then you went too far with her
and now we are in the nests.

55:52.810 --> 55:55.383
Do you know who the car is
has ridden in the practice?

55:55.562 --> 55:59.560
Do you know why I got a blow?
- Tell me.

55:59.733 --> 56:01.441
That is really going to help us.

56:02.945 --> 56:06.693
We do not even know
how the other car is ready.

56:08.617 --> 56:13.279
We only need a few minutes.
We help them out and then leave.

56:14.581 --> 56:16.075
Come on, man.

56:17.167 --> 56:20.951
Listen to me.
It only takes a few minutes.

56:22.506 --> 56:25.673
Damn, Thomas,
listen to me once.

56:27.636 --> 56:30.922
This has gone completely out of hand, is not it?

56:32.474 --> 56:36.009
I know, but it will be fine.

56:37.104 --> 56:40.188
It will be all right.
We just have to ...

56:42.568 --> 56:46.352
We just have to ...
- The car has a transmitter.

56:51.285 --> 56:52.660
A channel.

56:56.331 --> 56:59.914
Guest, you're crazy.
- Not true.

57:00.085 --> 57:03.335
I saw it with my own eyes.
The car has a transmitter.

57:07.134 --> 57:10.467
Who is the guest who controlled the car?

57:12.139 --> 57:14.926
No idea.
He was different.

57:16.185 --> 57:17.513
What else?

57:19.396 --> 57:21.187
He looked different.

57:21.356 --> 57:25.271
You are now pretending
that there was another driver?

57:25.444 --> 57:26.819
So yes?

57:26.987 --> 57:31.281
Did not you think that was strange?
- No, I did not think that was strange.

57:31.450 --> 57:35.863
I do not know. I thought he was
from the same car company.

57:36.038 --> 57:39.656
It did not come to you
to view his identity card?

57:39.833 --> 57:41.790
I did not think about that.

57:46.798 --> 57:49.124
We do not even know who those guests are.

57:49.301 --> 57:53.002
Who those guests are,
they know where the car is.

57:53.180 --> 57:55.338
They are probably on the road now.

57:59.895 --> 58:02.468
You're right.

58:04.817 --> 58:06.097
Come with me.

58:06.276 --> 58:08.103
We can not leave them.

58:29.925 --> 58:31.336
He does not work.

58:32.302 --> 58:33.547
I'm afraid.

58:58.036 --> 59:00.243
I'm going to help the girls.
- I'm going to look at that.

59:00.414 --> 59:01.742
Hurry up.

59:05.586 --> 59:09.286
How are you?
- Good. We are only dying.

59:09.464 --> 59:12.465
My leg is stuck.

59:13.719 --> 59:17.135
Disconnect it.
- I'll take away the branches.

59:34.531 --> 59:36.156
There is something in the chair.

59:52.925 --> 59:54.170
This is not normal.

59:59.431 --> 01:00:01.839
There is more.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:17.983
501, I'm on Acorn Road,
but I need information.

01:00:18.158 --> 01:00:19.950
I need backup.

01:00:20.118 --> 01:00:22.574
Why is this still bleating?

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:29.286
Who are these people?

01:00:49.857 --> 01:00:51.232
LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.811
What is going on?

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.980
I have already called for backup.

01:00:57.156 --> 01:00:58.187
FBI.

01:00:59.283 --> 01:01:01.359
Who called the FBI?

01:01:03.245 --> 01:01:05.238
What is going on here?

01:01:05.414 --> 01:01:07.786
I'm going to find this out.
This is suspicious.

01:01:20.762 --> 01:01:22.885
I think I found something.

01:01:33.775 --> 01:01:36.776
Where does that suitcase come from?
- No idea.

01:01:41.074 --> 01:01:44.241
Understood.
There are more agents on the road.

01:01:44.411 --> 01:01:47.412
They also said that the FBI
did not receive a notification.

01:02:04.389 --> 01:02:05.967
Wait a second.
I've got it.

01:02:29.623 --> 01:02:31.248
What was that?

01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:33.365
They are.

01:02:34.753 --> 01:02:38.122
Try to find something.
- Wait a second.

01:02:38.298 --> 01:02:39.378
Hurry up.

01:02:55.315 --> 01:02:57.677
I do not know who I'm dealing with here.

01:03:00.863 --> 01:03:01.942
Understood.

01:03:24.011 --> 01:03:25.090
Stoop.

01:03:49.369 --> 01:03:52.738
We have to leave here.
We have to save ourselves.

01:04:06.428 --> 01:04:10.212
You can free me
by pressing hard.

01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:12.015
What should I do?
- Try it.

01:04:12.142 --> 01:04:13.886
Are you crazy?
- Come on.

01:04:14.061 --> 01:04:17.346
I can break it.
- Better that, than that I'm stuck.

01:04:17.523 --> 01:04:19.100
Just do it.

01:04:20.651 --> 01:04:21.730
Fast.

01:04:24.738 --> 01:04:26.446
Wait a second.

01:04:31.245 --> 01:04:32.822
Are you ready for it?

01:04:41.964 --> 01:04:43.707
It hurts so much.

01:05:44.568 --> 01:05:46.893
This is my fault.
Mine.

01:05:49.865 --> 01:05:51.110
It is over.

01:05:53.118 --> 01:05:56.119
We can not do anything for her.
She is dead.

01:07:51.236 --> 01:07:53.028
There is gas.

01:07:53.197 --> 01:07:55.106
We have to remove them quickly.

01:08:30.651 --> 01:08:32.939
What are you doing?
Gas is leaking.

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:38.694
I save our lives.
- What are you talking about?

01:08:40.077 --> 01:08:43.078
We stole a car
and ridden in the practice.

01:08:43.247 --> 01:08:46.082
We killed two people.
We are being chased.

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:49.832
You're running through. That is
no reason to burn them alive.

01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:54.625
I burn the evidence.

01:08:56.301 --> 01:08:59.468
Get out the way.
- Listen to me, Thomas.

01:08:59.638 --> 01:09:01.595
You're running through.

01:09:01.765 --> 01:09:04.303
If you do that,
then we are doomed.

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:11.430
Just help me.
Help me get those girls out of the car.

01:09:11.608 --> 01:09:14.099
Then we leave here.

01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:35.245
Hold on.

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.960
Go away from the window.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.527
Damn, man.
- They know where we are. They are coming.

01:10:02.701 --> 01:10:05.821
I know.
That's why we have to leave here.

01:10:05.996 --> 01:10:09.246
We should not kill everyone.
- The car has a transmitter.

01:10:10.334 --> 01:10:12.457
We have been framed there.
- I know.

01:10:12.628 --> 01:10:15.629
Do not.
Calm down.

01:10:15.797 --> 01:10:17.375
Put away the weapon.

01:10:17.549 --> 01:10:21.629
Do it away.
Do not focus on me.

01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:46.574
What are you doing?
Do away.

01:11:51.018 --> 01:11:53.687
Here.

01:11:57.316 --> 01:11:59.723
There they are. I'll be closer.
- Understood.

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.971
Turn off the light.
Now.

01:12:36.939 --> 01:12:38.219
Come on let's go.

01:14:10.324 --> 01:14:11.866
I do not want to die here.

01:14:43.899 --> 01:14:47.185
Jess, it's over.

01:14:56.078 --> 01:14:57.323
Please do not go.

01:16:14.907 --> 01:16:16.282
I need you.

01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:19.949
We must free Caroline.

01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:35.092
She is still in the car.

01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:53.355
Who are you?

01:16:56.114 --> 01:16:58.570
Excuse me, who are you?

01:17:03.247 --> 01:17:05.323
Why are you doing this?

01:17:05.499 --> 01:17:07.159
Shut up.

01:17:07.334 --> 01:17:08.959
Let me go.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.996
The police are on their way.

01:17:13.841 --> 01:17:15.418
I am now the police.

01:17:18.554 --> 01:17:21.389
Please, I have not stolen your car.

01:17:21.557 --> 01:17:26.847
I only got a lift.
I thought the car was theirs.

01:17:27.938 --> 01:17:31.354
You were just at the wrong time
in the wrong place.

01:17:37.531 --> 01:17:38.750
Is there someone in the car?

01:17:42.119 --> 01:17:43.578
Answer.

01:17:52.546 --> 01:17:54.254
Please do not do it.

01:18:06.477 --> 01:18:10.557
Run away, Jess.
- Stupid jerk.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.974
Why do not you just come out?

01:18:50.687 --> 01:18:52.312
I'll find you anyway.

01:19:32.312 --> 01:19:34.638
I will not play games anymore.

01:19:34.815 --> 01:19:35.977
Where is my weapon?

01:19:59.006 --> 01:20:01.082
It is a pity
that I'm going to kill you now.

01:20:01.258 --> 01:20:03.714
You could have watched
how I killed your friends.

01:20:08.474 --> 01:20:09.884
You are combative.

01:20:12.769 --> 01:20:13.913
I like that.

01:21:54.371 --> 01:21:57.822
Jess, I'm sorry.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:14.265
I have to go.
- Wait a second.

01:22:15.934 --> 01:22:17.215
Let me help you.

01:23:12.783 --> 01:23:14.775
Save me, please.

01:26:15.048 --> 01:26:18.334
Help me the next time
remind of...

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:20.170
... that I charge my phone.

01:26:27.186 --> 01:26:28.384
Watch out.
