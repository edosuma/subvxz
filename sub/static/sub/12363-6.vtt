01:12.772 --> 01:14.640
Hey!

01:14.642 --> 01:16.542
Hello?!

01:16.544 --> 01:18.010
You need something?!

01:18.012 --> 01:20.779
Sweet dreams,
sheriff!

01:20.781 --> 01:25.417
It's a beautiful night
to be born!

01:34.728 --> 01:37.629
ruby, it's me.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.798
I think we have
a dead body.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.567
Where?

01:43.503 --> 01:45.737
I have no idea.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.452
Morning, sheriff.
Morning.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.321
Reports of any deaths
last night?

02:02.323 --> 02:03.822
Uh, no.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.324
How about this morning?

02:05.326 --> 02:08.293
No. Why?
You want there to be one?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.461
Think I just got
a tip.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.630
You think? From who?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.298
a heyoka.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.368
You mean the drunk guy
who walks backwards

02:16.370 --> 02:18.070
Around the square?
That one?

02:18.072 --> 02:19.404
Excuse me?

02:19.406 --> 02:21.273
Cheyenne man
that lives in the area.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.442
He's, uh,
something of a, uh...

02:23.444 --> 02:24.776
A head case.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.578
...Sacred clown.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.747
Cheyenne call him
contrary warrior.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.816
He, uh, does the opposite
of what you'd expect.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.451
Why?

02:32.453 --> 02:34.186
Tradition, mostly.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.522
Seems the whole idea
is to get people

02:36.524 --> 02:37.856
Out of their
comfort zones,

02:37.858 --> 02:40.159
Force them to examine
their beliefs.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.861
That's annoying.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.797
If I just heard him right,
we got a dead body somewhere.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.500
Walt.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.769
I know you hate
politics,

02:50.771 --> 02:52.638
But pretending
there's a murder...

02:52.640 --> 02:54.106
It's a strange way
of procrastinating

02:54.108 --> 02:55.841
Before the debate.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.609
I'm not procrastinating.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.545
Well, have you been
preparing?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.180
For the last decade.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.249
Just got a call.
I guess your heyoka was right.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.418
Or would that be wrong?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.753
We got a body.

03:18.164 --> 03:20.566
That's not a body.
It's a skull.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.569
Looks like
some pottery, too.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.438
Better call in the university
and the culture committee.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.808
Could be a cheyenne
burial site.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.912
My first question is

03:33.914 --> 03:36.448
Who am I not going to
fire for this?!

03:36.450 --> 03:38.317
Barlow, there are regulations
about these things.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.318
Let's be reasonable.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.186
I'm always reasonable,

03:41.188 --> 03:43.455
Which is why I am not
gonna stand around

03:43.457 --> 03:44.723
Funding
an arrowhead hunt!

03:44.725 --> 03:47.726
I don't need you to be
doing this right now.

03:47.728 --> 03:51.430
You want to be sheriff?
Start acting like a sheriff.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.165
Make the problem
go away.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.203
Vic, what's up?

03:58.205 --> 03:59.871
Give me walt.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.573
No.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.875
Damn it, branch,
just hand walt the phone.

04:03.877 --> 04:07.446
it's vic.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.652
Is that what my son
has grown up to be?

04:13.654 --> 04:17.189
Walt longmire's
personal assistant?

04:17.190 --> 04:18.523
What are you gonna do
at the debate...

04:18.524 --> 04:21.326
Fetch him his coffee?

04:21.327 --> 04:25.197
Branch, stay here.
Watch the site, and your father.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.399
Where are you going?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.268
Murder scene.

04:56.729 --> 04:59.731
Death card.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.436
You know, it's not
as sinister as it looks.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.239
All it means is that
something's coming to an end.

05:07.241 --> 05:08.573
Sometimes,
it's a good sign.

05:08.575 --> 05:09.741
Tell her that.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.811
Bruises
on her windpipe.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.682
Busted capillaries
under her eyelids.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.650
Looks like
she was strangled.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.352
Could be a robbery.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.521
Could be.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.423
No sign of forced entry,
though.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.757
Yeah, of course,
nobody around here

05:25.759 --> 05:27.926
Ever locks their doors
anyway.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.563
Looks like cassandra
had an open-door policy.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.899
Anyone could have
walked in here.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.635
It also looks like cassandra
wasn't actually named cassandra.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.837
Cynthia two rivers.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.839
I need to find
her brother, aaron.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.541
Why?

05:42.543 --> 05:45.477
He rode past my cabin
this morning.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.550
Seems strange to have
your tribe's contrary warrior

05:51.552 --> 05:53.552
Living in
an abandoned building.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.953
It would be strange,

05:54.955 --> 05:57.489
Especially since the last
actual contrary warrior

05:57.491 --> 05:59.491
Died in 1974.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.360
What does that
make aaron?

06:01.362 --> 06:05.097
A pest...
With pretensions.

06:30.423 --> 06:33.925
Aaron,
your sister's dead.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.927
That why you rode past
my cabin this morning...

06:35.929 --> 06:37.696
To tell me?

06:37.698 --> 06:40.031
No.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.567
Your cabin
rode past me.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.607
Aaron...

06:48.609 --> 06:51.042
Walt is looking for
your sister's killer,

06:51.044 --> 06:54.579
So cut the crazy-indian act
for a minute and help.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.448
Maybe...

06:56.450 --> 07:01.453
I should follow
your example...

07:01.455 --> 07:05.857
And pretend
not to be indian at all.

07:07.026 --> 07:10.762
Red on the outside,
white on the inside.

07:10.764 --> 07:15.767
Here, a shining apple
for your teacher!

07:15.769 --> 07:17.469
Aaron, where were you
last night?

07:17.471 --> 07:19.137
Home.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.839
You are homeless.

07:20.841 --> 07:24.576
Shining apple,
so are you!

07:24.578 --> 07:26.912
Aaron, if you can't give me
a straight answer,

07:26.914 --> 07:29.414
I have no choice
but to arrest you.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.584
How did you know
your sister was dead?

07:32.586 --> 07:36.087
I- I walked to her place.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.623
I looked inside, and...

07:38.625 --> 07:42.494
Her body was there,
but she was not.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.562
Did you kill her?

07:43.564 --> 07:44.896
No! Did you?!

07:44.898 --> 07:46.431
Stop it.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.834
I need...
I need to stand.

07:53.540 --> 07:58.543
Sheriff, I loved her.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.714
She was the only one
who believed in me.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.119
You have to find who did this
and make them pay.

08:08.121 --> 08:12.123
I'll do everything
I can.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.460
I believe you.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.862
ahh!

08:18.865 --> 08:21.566
You can never tell
when he is telling the truth.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.436
He's just like
everybody else, then.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.671
At least he's up front
about it.

08:30.476 --> 08:32.811
Before I banned him
from the red pony,

08:32.813 --> 08:34.513
Aaron two rivers
used to drink his fill

08:34.515 --> 08:35.947
And walk out the door
backwards...

08:35.948 --> 08:37.649
Without paying.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.217
His contrary act is less
charming than you think.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.190
Sheriff!

08:45.192 --> 08:46.725
Sheriff.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.228
I was questioning...
The clients...

08:50.230 --> 08:52.964
Who kept coming
into cassandra's.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.666
This one guy took off
as soon as he saw me.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.001
Get his
license-plate number?

08:56.003 --> 08:58.537
No, just a good read
on his face.

08:58.539 --> 08:59.871
Find him.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.675
Hey. Check this out.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.578
So, there are five hidden mikes
in this room alone.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.315
And if you follow
the wires...

09:15.555 --> 09:17.222
Cassandra taped
her sessions.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.924
And I can't find
any tapes,

09:18.926 --> 09:20.926
And I have searched
everywhere.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.928
Maybe that's what
the killer was after.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.262
No, I want...
I want to know what's going on!

09:24.264 --> 09:25.964
I'm not...

09:25.966 --> 09:27.065
Where's cassandra?
Cassandra?!

09:27.067 --> 09:28.600
Calvin!
Sir...

09:28.602 --> 09:30.268
Cassandra, are you...
you can't go in there!

09:30.270 --> 09:31.970
I just want to know...
where's cassandra?!

09:31.972 --> 09:33.505
That's all I want to know!

09:33.507 --> 09:36.141
She's dead.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.576
No!

09:37.578 --> 09:40.078
She's only one
who knows where emma is.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.980
It's okay, baby.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.815
- she's... she's the only one who knows!
- I know.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.824
This is emma,
our daughter.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.526
What happened?

09:54.528 --> 09:57.529
Two years ago,
we went, uh...

09:57.531 --> 10:00.198
Camping on the blackwater river,
near pensacola.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.700
Gretchen was cooking,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.602
And I was, uh,
reading some stupid article.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.271
Calvin...
so, I let her go...

10:06.273 --> 10:08.640
To the river by herself.

10:08.642 --> 10:12.177
She said, "bye,"
went out the camper forever.

10:12.179 --> 10:16.047
The police ruled emma's death
an accidental drowning.

10:16.049 --> 10:20.051
We left florida and moved here
a year ago to start over.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.920
We started hearing stories
about cassandra,

10:21.922 --> 10:25.056
That she could
locate cheyenne graves

10:25.058 --> 10:27.058
By contacting the dead.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.594
At... at first,
a- all I wanted was cassandra

10:29.596 --> 10:31.096
To tell emma
that I was sorry,

10:31.098 --> 10:36.034
But on our first session,
she told me that she...

10:37.604 --> 10:39.938
Did she tell you your daughter
was still alive?

10:39.940 --> 10:40.939
Yes.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.142
I mean, no one saw her
go into the river.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.844
A- a body was
never recovered.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.579
I mean, it's possible,
you know?

10:47.581 --> 10:49.581
How often have you
come back to cassandra

10:49.583 --> 10:51.249
Since she told you this?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.951
Once or twice a week.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.686
She asked us to bring in
objects connected to emma,

10:54.688 --> 10:59.357
So we've been bringing in
clothes, jewelry...

10:59.359 --> 11:00.759
Diaries.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.093
To help her locate
your daughter.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.796
Cassandra said
that emma was somewhere

11:04.798 --> 11:07.799
in the woods
in the northeast.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.668
I mean, we're so close,
sheriff.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.202
That's what makes this
so hard.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.071
Cassandra
called us last night.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.106
She had another vision.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.976
Yeah, we thought today
might be the day.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.844
Did you...

11:19.846 --> 11:21.046
You know,
see anything written down

11:21.048 --> 11:23.048
About emma
or anything like that?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.382
Not yet.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.254
It's okay, yeah.
Okay.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.262
Ferg said none of the neighbors
saw or heard anything,

11:37.264 --> 11:39.164
But no one answered
over here.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.806
what now?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.307
There's a killer
on the loose,

11:49.309 --> 11:52.377
And no one's answering,
so...

11:54.146 --> 11:56.214
...Better make
a public-safety check.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.263
Holy shit.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.099
Who would want to
live like this?

12:15.367 --> 12:19.237
Apparently,
our murder victim.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.439
This is
cassandra's place, too?

12:21.441 --> 12:25.009
So she's a psychic
and a hoarder?

12:26.679 --> 12:28.847
I don't think cassandra's
simply a hoarder.

12:28.849 --> 12:32.717
Medical, legal records,
uh, background checks.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.219
This looks like research.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.954
We research our subjects.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.056
Maybe psychics
do the same thing.

12:38.058 --> 12:41.926
Maybe our victim simply
investigated her clients

12:41.928 --> 12:44.162
And passed it off
as psychic.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.934
Well, if she did,
then she could have

12:49.936 --> 12:53.438
Learned something
that she shouldn't have.

12:53.440 --> 12:59.043
Like maybe a husband...
Cheating on a wife?

13:01.313 --> 13:03.181
There's a lot
of secrets here.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.383
Which means
a lot of suspects.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.490
Well, will you look
at this?

13:12.492 --> 13:15.493
Now, this is why they say
it can take months

13:15.495 --> 13:17.495
To properly assess
a burial site.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.030
Jacob nighthorse,
what in the hell

13:19.032 --> 13:20.398
Are you doing
on my land?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.934
Well, I'm representing
the tribal council, barlow,

13:22.936 --> 13:24.269
And the cheyenne
culture committee.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.271
And, of course,
you know if this turns out

13:26.273 --> 13:27.972
To be
a significant finding,

13:27.974 --> 13:29.841
The remains
will have to stay put,

13:29.843 --> 13:33.178
And you'll need to build
around them.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.181
This is the 15th hole,
and I can't have a teepee

13:36.183 --> 13:38.049
- In the middle of the damn fairway.
- Dad.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.918
Let me ask you
something.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.086
When you're building
your casino,

13:42.088 --> 13:44.088
Do you stop digging
every time you run across

13:44.090 --> 13:45.790
Some of
my people's garbage?

13:45.792 --> 13:48.459
You were directly warned
about this land, were you not?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.995
Well, if I paid attention
to every kook came my way,

13:50.997 --> 13:52.330
I'd be out in the desert
right now

13:52.332 --> 13:53.865
With tinfoil
on my head.

13:53.867 --> 13:57.869
Wait... what's this
about a warning?

13:57.871 --> 14:01.472
Oh, this cheyenne gal
came into a planning meeting,

14:01.474 --> 14:04.843
Said she had a vision
of indian remains on my land.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.512
Her name wasn't cassandra,
was it?

14:10.049 --> 14:11.916
I think so. Why?

14:11.918 --> 14:15.520
Looks like someone
strangled her last night.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.562
So, I'm g-guessing
we aren't just thoughtfully

14:24.564 --> 14:26.431
Giving people
their things back.

14:26.433 --> 14:30.301
When a client comes in, we'll
ask them their name, address,

14:30.303 --> 14:33.004
When was their last appointment,
and what about.

14:33.006 --> 14:36.007
That should give us
a timeline and suspect pool.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.510
Walt, could I talk to you
in your office?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.579
Just for a minute.

14:44.183 --> 14:47.518
Oh, dad, I found
your dress khakis

14:47.520 --> 14:49.387
In the back
of the cabin closet.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.922
They look brand-new.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.423
That's 'cause
I've never worn them.

14:52.425 --> 14:56.127
And if you show up at
the town hall looking like that,

14:56.129 --> 14:58.463
You might never
get a chance to, either.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.064
That mean you're gonna
vote for me?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.599
That depends on how you do
in the debate.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.037
These are
some of the questions

15:06.039 --> 15:07.839
You'll be fielding
at the debate.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.174
I thought the questions were
supposed to be impromptu.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.876
Nothing is impromptu.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.045
The voters will be asking
both candidates hard questions.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.214
It would be better
if you were prepared.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.950
Think of it as leveling
the playing field.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.919
I can win this thing
fair and square.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.420
Fair and square like walt...
sticking you out here

15:22.422 --> 15:24.622
Babysitting your father
while he preps?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.324
you better answer that.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.326
I'm sure walt wants to
keep you distracted.

15:31.865 --> 15:34.198
Hey, ruby.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.201
Where?

15:37.203 --> 15:39.070
I'm on my way.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.440
So, where is
he sending you now?

15:42.442 --> 15:46.644
Just give me
the damn questions.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.950
This is walt's plan,
huh?

15:51.952 --> 15:54.953
Having me deal with
one tedious task after another

15:54.955 --> 15:57.121
While he gets ready
for the debate?

15:57.123 --> 16:00.291
This tedious task
is called police work,

16:00.293 --> 16:03.161
And walt didn't tell ruby
to send you here.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.664
I did, because I'm drowning
in this shit.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.199
So, what are you doing?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.201
Looking.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.402
For what?

16:11.404 --> 16:13.404
Something worth
killing for.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.672
Failing that,

16:14.674 --> 16:17.742
An appointment book
would be great.

16:22.281 --> 16:25.450
All right. Can I help you?
Do you have your I.D.?

16:25.452 --> 16:27.151
Yes.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.186
Walt.

16:28.188 --> 16:32.590
That's the guy who ran.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.194
Baseball helmet.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.197
Name and address,
please.

16:39.199 --> 16:43.267
Phil capps...
1909 packard place.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.604
Okay. When did you last
see cassandra?

16:46.606 --> 16:49.340
- Four days ago.
- Good.

16:49.342 --> 16:53.044
- Why'd you run off today
when you saw my deputy? - What?

16:53.046 --> 16:56.381
People flee a murder scene,
there's usually a reason.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.784
I didn't flee.
I was embarrassed.

17:02.087 --> 17:05.089
Riggs passed away
six months ago.

17:05.090 --> 17:06.156
He was the only
real family I had.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.492
every week,

17:08.494 --> 17:11.262
I made an appointment
to talk to him.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.164
I guess that's over.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.499
You can always go
to another psychic.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.135
I've tried.
They're a bunch of frauds.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.435
But cassandra
was different.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.003
She was the real deal.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.073
When she contacted
my grandpa joe,

17:22.075 --> 17:24.742
He told her when he died,

17:24.743 --> 17:27.278
When he married grandma,
everything.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.213
How else could she know?

17:29.215 --> 17:33.084
There's no appointment book,
but...

17:33.086 --> 17:35.753
I did find
the financial ledger.

17:35.755 --> 17:40.091
Should give us a client list,
a larger suspect pool.

17:43.997 --> 17:45.496
What's so funny?

17:45.498 --> 17:47.198
You just never know
who's gonna get fleeced

17:47.200 --> 17:49.033
By a drunken con artist.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.635
Prejudiced much?

17:50.637 --> 17:52.370
About what?

17:52.372 --> 17:54.372
Psychics get paid
to take wild guesses.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.740
People are so needy,

17:55.742 --> 17:57.708
They read into it
like it's some kind of gift.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.711
Check cassandra's finances.
She had a gift, all right...

18:00.713 --> 18:03.247
Gift for leveraging mortgages
on both her houses

18:03.249 --> 18:04.782
And running up huge bills
at bars and liquor stores.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.585
Maybe she was
self-medicating.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.055
What, you... you actually
believe in this stuff?

18:11.057 --> 18:13.491
Like you've never
had your cards read?

18:13.493 --> 18:15.660
Vic, I'm a guy...
in wyoming.

18:15.662 --> 18:19.230
The only cards I have read
are at the poker table.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.717
Paneling's not nailed down
all the way.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.419
hey, kenny rogers,
give me a hand.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.295
What the hell?

18:52.499 --> 18:55.733
This is, like,
the entire county.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.570
Asha little wolf...

18:59.572 --> 19:03.274
Kishori crowfoot... those are
cheyenne names, aren't they?

19:03.276 --> 19:05.710
Sound like it.

19:05.712 --> 19:09.380
Look... there's a birth
and a death date.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.816
Could be maps
of cheyenne graves.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.784
Why go to this much trouble
just to hide this?

19:13.786 --> 19:17.722
It's always dangerous to know
where the bodies are buried.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.599
What do you
make of those...

19:28.601 --> 19:31.736
Wow.
Don't.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.906
No,
wouldn't dream of it.

19:34.908 --> 19:38.442
We need to figure out
who drew up these maps and why.

19:38.444 --> 19:41.746
Maybe it was cassandra.
Spirits could have guided her.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.447
I mean, that's what her clients
would think, right?

19:43.449 --> 19:44.515
Some more than others.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.851
According to this ledger,

19:46.853 --> 19:48.853
Gretchen and calvin cowley
spent a small fortune

19:48.855 --> 19:50.087
Looking for
their daughter.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.989
There's no one
more desperate

19:51.991 --> 19:53.891
Than the parent
of a missing child.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.127
You think cassandra took advantage
of that and the cowleys snapped?

19:56.129 --> 19:57.795
You know, I haven't found
their file yet.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.964
That could have been
what was taken.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.732
- You searched the whole house?
- Yes.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.835
- No.
- Keep searching.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.905
Have ferg dig deeper
into the cowleys' finances.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.781
You wanted to see me.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.783
How are things progressing
at the burial site?

20:18.785 --> 20:20.685
Could be
an important finding.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.588
Construction will have to hold
while we expand the dig.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.656
Let me know if barlow
gives you any trouble.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.592
I appreciate
the unexpected support.

20:27.594 --> 20:31.062
Jacob, uh...

20:31.064 --> 20:34.065
I actually called you in
to discuss something else.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.666
A murder.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.935
I understand you visited
a psychic recently...

20:37.937 --> 20:39.804
Cassandra.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.672
I did. I did, indeed.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.541
Like many people,
I have a desire

20:43.543 --> 20:46.577
To stay in touch
with my ancestors.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.013
Yeah. How many times
you visit her?

20:49.015 --> 20:50.715
Two or three times.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.083
Imagine it's quite
an experience

20:52.085 --> 20:53.784
Speaking to the dead.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.853
So, which is it...
two or three?

20:55.855 --> 20:58.856
Three.
Why does it matter?

20:58.858 --> 21:00.558
That way, I can tell
if she was charging you

21:00.560 --> 21:04.228
$6,000 or $9,000
an hour.

21:04.230 --> 21:08.599
There's a line item here
said you paid her 18 grand.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.901
So what were you really
paying her for?

21:10.903 --> 21:15.539
psychic geological surveys.

21:15.541 --> 21:18.876
Cassandra walked my casino land,
searching for remains.

21:18.878 --> 21:22.046
She found none,
so I built.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.681
That was money
well spent?

21:23.683 --> 21:26.183
It was, and I bet you
barlow connally

21:26.185 --> 21:27.852
Wishes he'd done
the same.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.855
If I were you, I'd speak to him
about the murder.

21:30.857 --> 21:34.091
You don't need second sight
to see the anger in that man.

21:37.929 --> 21:41.532
And, by the way,
I like the uniform.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.302
It makes you look like someone
worth voting for.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.206
Deputy connally,

21:49.208 --> 21:51.575
Do you feel your family's
business in the area

21:51.577 --> 21:53.744
Will create
a conflict of interest

21:53.746 --> 21:55.246
For you as sheriff?

21:55.248 --> 21:58.149
Good business
is good news for our county.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.518
Now, I'm sure
many of you remember

22:00.520 --> 22:02.219
My uncle was once sheriff.

22:02.221 --> 22:04.922
And like lucien,
I am my own man.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.757
And I were pushed to choose

22:06.759 --> 22:08.759
Between our county's
best interests

22:08.761 --> 22:10.695
And my father's
profit margins,

22:10.697 --> 22:14.765
Trust me, I'll choose
absaroka every time.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.235
My question
is for sheriff longmire.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.004
Sure.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.644
Sheriff, is it true that
you're afraid of technology

22:26.646 --> 22:28.813
And you don't even
own a cellphone?

22:28.815 --> 22:31.549
I wouldn't call it fear.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.217
I'm s...

22:33.219 --> 22:38.322
As I just, uh,
ably demonstrated,

22:38.324 --> 22:41.025
Sometimes technology
is more of a distraction

22:41.027 --> 22:42.326
Than a help, so...

22:42.328 --> 22:45.329
Well, I will vote for you
early and often,

22:45.331 --> 22:46.997
But I was pulled over

22:46.999 --> 22:49.867
By this foul-mouthed
blonde lady last month,

22:49.869 --> 22:52.203
And it turns out
she's not even from here.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.572
Why are you taking jobs away
from wyoming residents?

22:54.574 --> 22:58.843
Sheriff, I'm very sorry
about the passing of your wife.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.344
Thank you.

23:00.346 --> 23:01.746
But didn't she lead
a movement

23:01.748 --> 23:05.116
To stop the building
of the casino?

23:05.118 --> 23:09.286
Yes. She did.

23:09.288 --> 23:11.989
My wife, martha,
was concerned

23:11.991 --> 23:13.691
About the influence
of the casino

23:13.693 --> 23:15.860
On local culture and crime.

23:15.862 --> 23:19.196
So, does that mean you're
gonna play "I told you so"

23:19.198 --> 23:22.066
Every time there's a crime
connected to the casino?

23:22.068 --> 23:24.235
Not at all...
my department will provide

23:24.237 --> 23:25.703
The same protection

23:25.705 --> 23:28.339
After the casino opens
as it did before.

23:28.341 --> 23:31.208
With just four people?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.210
The new casino will bring

23:33.212 --> 23:36.680
Tens of thousands of newcomers
to absaroka county.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.115
This will bring
new opportunities

23:38.117 --> 23:40.951
But also new challenges.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.621
Now, I've discussed
a security action plan

23:43.623 --> 23:45.122
With jacob nighthorse.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.991
And in this plan,

23:46.993 --> 23:49.693
The casino would hire
a private security firm

23:49.695 --> 23:51.996
That would coordinate
with my department,

23:51.998 --> 23:54.331
Keeping our area safe

23:54.333 --> 23:57.635
While creating
good local jobs.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.273
My question's
for the challenger.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.376
I look forward to it.

24:05.378 --> 24:07.745
Deputy connally, uh,

24:07.747 --> 24:10.748
You've been a deputy
for a short time.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.750
What experience
has prepared you

24:12.752 --> 24:14.418
To better serve
and protect our county

24:14.420 --> 24:16.086
Over your opponent?

24:18.690 --> 24:21.192
Yee-yee-yee-ooh! Whee-hoo!

24:21.194 --> 24:23.694
Whoo-whoo!
Whoo-whoo! Whoo-whoo!

24:23.696 --> 24:27.298
I'm the real sheriff
of this county,

24:27.300 --> 24:32.903
And you are all
under arrest for murder!

24:38.877 --> 24:42.379
You may be wondering
why this drunken clown

24:42.381 --> 24:46.250
Interrupted my brilliant
debate performance.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.419
Aaron, why did you
interrupt the debate?

24:48.421 --> 24:50.788
Indians hate
watching massacres.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.425
A- and you seem
more interested in politics

24:54.427 --> 24:58.796
Than catching
my sister's killer.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.164
We may have uncovered

25:00.166 --> 25:04.168
What your sister's killer
was looking for.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.438
Cassandra told me
these were lost,

25:07.440 --> 25:10.941
But you can never get
a straight story out of her.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.443
How did cassandra
put these maps together?

25:12.445 --> 25:14.011
She have a vision?

25:14.013 --> 25:17.181
My sister had a talent
for reading people,

25:17.183 --> 25:20.184
But the thunder spirit
did not reside in her.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.986
She did not have vision.

25:21.988 --> 25:26.991
Then how were
these maps made?

25:26.993 --> 25:29.994
When I was a boy...

25:29.996 --> 25:32.863
Grandma go go drove
all over the place,

25:32.865 --> 25:36.233
Taking down every cheyenne
grave marker she could find.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.102
For every grave,
she drew a map.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.436
Why?

25:39.438 --> 25:41.138
I believe that was
when cheyenne graves

25:41.140 --> 25:42.840
Were being ransacked
for artifacts.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.342
You can't rob graves
you can't find.

25:45.344 --> 25:50.047
Who knew your sister
had these maps?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.283
Nobody among the living.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.450
Is that the truth, aaron,

25:53.452 --> 25:55.419
Or another one
of your riddles?

25:55.421 --> 25:59.957
You tell me, shiny apple.

25:59.959 --> 26:03.127
Or maybe you can't
tell the difference between

26:03.129 --> 26:08.766
A shiny lie
and the plain truth.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.100
Shiny lie!

26:10.102 --> 26:11.969
Hey! Hey!

26:11.971 --> 26:13.837
shiny lie!

26:13.839 --> 26:16.874
Shiny lie! Aah!
Aah!

26:16.876 --> 26:18.242
Henry!
Aah!

26:18.244 --> 26:21.779
Perhaps he will
fall upward.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.449
You gonna arrest
cassandra's brother?

26:25.451 --> 26:27.017
I have him in a cell.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.519
I'll let him go
once he sobers up.

26:28.521 --> 26:30.054
Hey, vic, it's ferg.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.789
Checking out
the cowleys' finances.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.425
Their search for emma looks like
it's about to bankrupt them.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.293
Could be motive. Have you found
the cowleys' box or file?

26:36.295 --> 26:40.030
- Not yet. - They never came by
the station to claim anything.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.265
Cassandra had her clients

26:41.267 --> 26:43.500
Bring in their
most prized possessions.

26:43.502 --> 26:45.302
Maybe we should start looking
at people who aren't coming in.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.472
Call if we have something.
Yeah, me too.

27:19.504 --> 27:21.205
Hey! Don't move!

27:34.552 --> 27:36.086
Why did you break
into cassandra's house?

27:36.088 --> 27:37.388
Curiosity.

27:37.390 --> 27:40.090
We know you and calvin
have paid a lot of money

27:40.092 --> 27:41.392
Hoping to find
your daughter.

27:41.394 --> 27:44.061
I also have some evidence
that cassandra

27:44.063 --> 27:45.496
Might be a fraud.

27:45.498 --> 27:50.267
And if she lied to you
about emma being alive,

27:50.269 --> 27:52.469
Nobody would blame you
for being angry.

27:52.471 --> 27:58.142
I caught on to cassandra's con
pretty early.

27:58.144 --> 28:01.145
One time, she tried
describing emma to us.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.646
I recognized
the language...

28:02.648 --> 28:06.417
It was from a news article,
nearly word for word.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.118
Why not call her on it?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.920
I couldn't do that
to calvin.

28:09.922 --> 28:15.592
Before we met cassandra,
he was suicidal.

28:15.594 --> 28:19.196
But with her,
he had hope,

28:19.198 --> 28:23.067
Something to live for.

28:23.069 --> 28:27.037
So you paid cassandra
to lie to your husband?

28:27.039 --> 28:29.039
I had to decide
what I loved more...

28:29.041 --> 28:31.375
Calvin or the truth.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.210
It wasn't that hard.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.712
Where's calvin right now?

28:36.681 --> 28:41.051
Fiddler's tap room
out on highway 12.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.419
Drinking.

28:42.421 --> 28:45.122
So, why were you
in cassandra's house, really?

28:45.124 --> 28:48.492
I was hoping to get rid of any
research connected to emma.

28:48.494 --> 28:49.560
What do you think
calvin would do

28:49.562 --> 28:51.361
If he knew cassandra
was a fraud?

28:51.363 --> 28:55.065
He wouldn't kill her,
if that's what you're asking.

28:55.067 --> 28:58.402
Calvin doesn't own a gun.
He's never even fired one.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.939
Cassandra wasn't shot.
She was strangled, silenced.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.440
I just called the tap room.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.043
They haven't seen calvin
all day.

29:14.487 --> 29:17.621
Mrs. Cowley,
where's your husband?

29:17.623 --> 29:21.325
I don't know.

29:21.327 --> 29:25.329
He took off
after we talked to you.

29:25.331 --> 29:29.199
If your husband figured out
the truth about cassandra...

29:29.201 --> 29:33.103
He needs our help.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.105
Hi.

29:35.107 --> 29:38.008
So, I found another box for you
to add to your collection.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.344
What's inside?

29:40.346 --> 29:41.645
I don't know.

29:41.647 --> 29:44.381
I didn't think it was
my place to look.

29:59.264 --> 30:01.765
Tell me something.

30:01.767 --> 30:04.768
Why did I find myself
in walt's office this morning,

30:04.770 --> 30:07.471
Being questioned
about a murder?

30:07.473 --> 30:10.340
I knew you could talk your way
out of that ledger,

30:10.342 --> 30:11.675
But I found
something else

30:11.677 --> 30:13.210
You couldn't
talk your way out of.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.545
What is that?

30:14.547 --> 30:17.080
Maps of cheyenne graves,

30:17.082 --> 30:20.083
Which are now
in walt's possession...

30:20.085 --> 30:23.086
All except two.

30:23.088 --> 30:25.589
My father's
golf course development

30:25.591 --> 30:29.459
And this casino property.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.628
According to these,

30:31.630 --> 30:35.332
There weren't actually
any remains on my father's land.

30:35.334 --> 30:40.037
But there were bodies buried
right here on yours.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.139
Well,
that's interesting.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.473
Did you pay off cassandra

30:43.475 --> 30:45.442
To move those remains
from your property,

30:45.444 --> 30:47.611
Place them
on my father's?

30:47.613 --> 30:50.147
I was right about you.

30:50.149 --> 30:53.584
You will make
one hell of a sheriff.

30:53.586 --> 30:57.754
I know, but that wasn't
the question.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.623
A few months ago,
cassandra warned me

30:59.625 --> 31:01.425
About bodies
on this land.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.126
If I didn't pay her,
she said,

31:03.128 --> 31:05.462
She'd start having visions
in public.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.464
So it was a shakedown.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.333
For about five minutes.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.835
Then I offered her
10 times what she was asking.

31:11.837 --> 31:14.838
All she had to do
was make those remains

31:14.840 --> 31:18.375
Show up
on barlow's land.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.545
And I got to say, that's some
impressive detective work.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.547
Actually...

31:23.549 --> 31:25.649
I'll hold onto these
for now.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.719
Level the playing field.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.726
There's no chance
that cassandra got greedy...

31:35.728 --> 31:38.495
Tried to blackmail you?

31:41.666 --> 31:44.534
Do you have an alibi
for the night of her murder?

31:44.536 --> 31:46.403
I am my alibi.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.804
If I had killed cassandra,

31:47.806 --> 31:49.673
You wouldn't have found
a ledger with my name on it

31:49.675 --> 31:51.675
Inside her house.

31:51.677 --> 31:54.211
In fact,
if I were to kill someone,

31:54.213 --> 31:55.879
I suspect
no one would ever find

31:55.881 --> 32:00.250
Trace or trail
of the crime.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.487
Enjoy the rest
of your night, deputy.

32:03.489 --> 32:07.524
And do watch your step.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.161
I found
our missing husband.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.332
Calvin cowley.
Where is he?

32:15.334 --> 32:17.668
Sheridan... he just put
a charge on his credit card

32:17.670 --> 32:19.670
For mama tia's
psychic readings.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.371
Looks like
he's still a believer.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.373
Which makes it unlikely
he killed cassandra

32:23.375 --> 32:26.143
Out of, uh,
disillusioned rage.

32:26.145 --> 32:30.414
Just like everybody, he loved
cassandra, the drunken grifter.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.848
Show some respect.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.617
What did I say?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.786
I'm just getting
a little tired of everybody

32:35.788 --> 32:37.654
Piling on the victim.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.523
People found comfort
in her,

32:39.525 --> 32:42.225
And I seriously doubt
that she was an alcoholic.

32:42.227 --> 32:44.828
Branch told you about
her credit-card charges.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.830
Yeah...
bars and liquor stores.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.833
But I have spent the last
I don't know how many hours

32:49.835 --> 32:51.535
In cassandra's house.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.403
How many alcoholic hoarders
do you know

32:53.405 --> 32:56.306
That have exactly zero bottles
in their house?

33:00.411 --> 33:03.914
Cassandra's clients...
they love her.

33:03.916 --> 33:08.618
Maybe it wasn't
a client.

33:08.620 --> 33:13.256
Maybe she told someone something
they didn't want to hear.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.837
You here to arrest me?

33:32.343 --> 33:34.344
You didn't answer
my question.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.580
You gonna place me
under arrest?

33:36.582 --> 33:39.916
Depends.

33:39.918 --> 33:43.787
Where were you
two nights ago

33:43.789 --> 33:45.655
When that psychic
was murdered?

33:45.657 --> 33:47.958
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.826
After everything
I've given to him,

33:49.828 --> 33:53.530
My son still has the gall
to come into my house

33:53.532 --> 33:55.298
And accuse me of murder.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.801
Now, if you think I did it,
just come out and say so.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.337
Dad, just tell me
where you were.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.005
Well, let's see.

34:02.007 --> 34:05.809
Uh, I was just about where
you are right now, actually.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.411
Doing what?

34:07.413 --> 34:08.779
A 26-year-old stewardess
with daddy issues.

34:08.781 --> 34:10.380
Eh.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.750
That's a little
too much information,

34:13.752 --> 34:16.286
But that's all
I needed to know.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.788
No. No, no, no.

34:17.790 --> 34:20.791
You do not get away
that easy.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.793
Now, tell me, son,

34:22.795 --> 34:24.494
Where are you getting
all the cash

34:24.496 --> 34:25.929
For these campaign ads?

34:25.931 --> 34:28.632
It's not my money.
I know it's not your money.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.634
<i>But then, it's never been
your money, has it?</i>

34:30.636 --> 34:31.967
I have allies
and supporters.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.937
You mean you have
investors,

34:33.938 --> 34:37.641
Who will be impatient
for their returns.

34:37.643 --> 34:42.646
Is that why my golf course
is indefinitely delayed?

34:42.648 --> 34:45.482
Jacob nighthorse pays
for a few commercials,

34:45.484 --> 34:46.783
And you throw the old man
under the bus?

34:46.784 --> 34:49.652
Actually,
I now have the leverage

34:49.655 --> 34:51.987
That would force nighthorse
to remove those remains

34:51.989 --> 34:54.524
So construction can
start back up again.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.859
Good. Use it.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.994
I need something
from you first.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.629
And what would that be?

34:59.631 --> 35:01.531
My coffee.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.792
Hello, aaron.

35:32.930 --> 35:37.934
Your sister, uh,
made a living selling lies.

35:37.936 --> 35:41.938
You were ostracized
for serving the truth.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.508
You must have appreciated
the irony.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.410
Ironically enough,
I didn't.

35:47.412 --> 35:51.515
Aaron, tell me
what happened.

35:51.517 --> 35:54.417
I need you to drop
the contrary act.

35:54.419 --> 35:58.455
I can't.
I had the thunder dream.

35:58.457 --> 36:01.691
I have to obey
the thunder spirit.

36:04.929 --> 36:08.465
I used to think
it was my calling.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.500
It's my curse.

36:12.737 --> 36:15.906
I think I understand.

36:29.487 --> 36:30.887
What are you doing?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.999
Sheriff...

36:45.102 --> 36:46.803
...I'm here
to turn myself in

36:46.805 --> 36:49.806
For the murder of my sister,
cassandra.

36:53.778 --> 36:57.781
But why...

36:57.783 --> 37:02.652
Would you kill your own
flesh and blood, aaron?

37:02.654 --> 37:06.823
My sister
was paying bar tabs,

37:06.825 --> 37:09.526
Liquor-store bills
all over the county,

37:09.528 --> 37:11.161
Including
at the red pony.

37:11.163 --> 37:16.032
Wasn't her drinking
she was paying for.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.801
It was mine.

37:20.171 --> 37:25.041
Two nights ago, she found me
ransacking her house...

37:25.043 --> 37:27.744
Looking for money.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.646
She told me
she was cutting me off.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.148
Actually...

37:32.150 --> 37:35.151
First, she told you
she was cutting you off,

37:35.153 --> 37:39.689
Then you started throwing
and breaking things.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.859
Yes, because it meant
no more alcohol.

37:42.861 --> 37:45.028
And she knew
that was the only thing

37:45.030 --> 37:47.197
That quieted the voices
in my head.

37:47.199 --> 37:50.900
But it was never
about the booze, was it?

37:50.902 --> 37:52.602
Your sister told you

37:52.604 --> 37:55.772
That you never
had the thunder dream,

37:55.774 --> 37:59.676
That you are not
a contrary warrior,

37:59.678 --> 38:02.846
That you're nothing more than
a paranoid schizophrenic

38:02.848 --> 38:05.548
Who needs clinical help.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.884
You heard the one person

38:07.886 --> 38:12.622
You thought actually
believed in you say, "no."

38:12.624 --> 38:15.158
She said she was gonna
have you institutionalized,

38:15.160 --> 38:17.861
And you snapped,
didn't you?

38:17.863 --> 38:22.866
I would do anything
to take it back.

38:22.868 --> 38:26.202
But I can't.

38:26.204 --> 38:28.738
And now I must face
what I have done.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.842
It is my sacred duty
to serve the truth.

38:37.014 --> 38:41.017
Aaron two rivers...

38:41.019 --> 38:43.620
You're under arrest.

39:14.085 --> 39:17.787
I need to talk to gretchen
and calvin cowley

39:17.789 --> 39:19.022
About their daughter.

39:23.994 --> 39:26.963
How do you know
about the cowleys?

39:38.210 --> 39:41.845
Sheriff, what are you
doing here?

39:41.847 --> 39:43.713
Who is this?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.048
Cassandra's brother.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.584
He asked to speak to you
about your daughter.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.785
Is that okay?

39:48.787 --> 39:51.154
Yes, please.

39:51.156 --> 39:55.158
I talked to my sister...

39:55.160 --> 39:56.793
About emma.

39:56.795 --> 40:00.663
She told me
she was in vermont,

40:00.665 --> 40:03.800
Outside burlington...

40:03.802 --> 40:06.736
In a blue house.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.284
Was that the truth?

40:23.754 --> 40:27.690
Would you believe it
if it was?

40:35.833 --> 40:36.966
Hey, dad.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.002
Hi.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.871
You said you had
something to show me.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.106
What is it?

40:45.342 --> 40:47.343
I don't know yet.

40:47.345 --> 40:49.879
Vic, uh, found this
among the possessions

40:49.881 --> 40:51.381
Of a dead psychic.

40:51.383 --> 40:53.082
Well, I have
a hard time believing

40:53.084 --> 40:56.419
That you ever visited
a psychic.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.222
I didn't.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.060
But it appears
that your mom did.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.242
Do you want to
hear this?

41:35.060 --> 41:36.392
<i>To be honest,</i>

41:36.394 --> 41:40.096
<i>I normally would
never come here.</i>

41:40.098 --> 41:42.799
<i>But things
have changed in my life.</i>

41:42.801 --> 41:45.969
<i>The spirits say,
if you're asking</i>

41:45.971 --> 41:48.304
<i>Whether or not
the cancer will kill you,</i>

41:48.306 --> 41:52.208
<i>Their answer is...
No, it will not.</i>

41:52.210 --> 41:54.277
<i>I just got my diagnosis
two days ago.</i>

41:54.279 --> 41:57.981
They say it's terminal.

41:57.983 --> 42:00.316
How could you even know?

42:00.318 --> 42:02.018
<i>Is there anything else</i>

42:02.020 --> 42:05.722
<i>You would like the spirits
to tell you?</i>

42:05.724 --> 42:08.725
<i>Yes.
My husband, walt...</i>

42:08.727 --> 42:10.994
<i>What will
happen to him?</i>

42:10.996 --> 42:13.997
<i>You truly want to know?</i>

42:13.999 --> 42:16.165
<i>Yes.</i>

42:16.167 --> 42:17.300
<i>The spirits say...</i>

42:23.073 --> 42:26.943
I guess we'll find out
soon enough.
