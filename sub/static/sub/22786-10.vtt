&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:08.240 --> 00:10.840
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.440

00:30.720 --> 00:34.600
&lrm;Yes, Mrs Césaire. The girls are ready
&lrm;for bed, uh... technically speaking.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.320
&lrm;Yeah, we're good! Enjoy the movie!

00:38.440 --> 00:42.360
&lrm;Come on, bedtime, you little monsters!
&lrm;That's enough mischief for one day!

00:42.480 --> 00:46.160
&lrm;It's not us, it's the Sapotis! Ha, ha!

00:46.280 --> 00:48.960
&lrm;Off to bed, little Sapotis!
&lrm;You need to rest

00:49.080 --> 00:52.360
&lrm;-if you want to be fighting fit tomorrow!
&lrm;-It's not fair!

00:52.480 --> 00:55.880
&lrm;We don't want to go to bed.
&lrm;We want to stay up, like you!

00:56.000 --> 00:59.280
&lrm;Yeah, we wanna watch the movie
&lrm;and tell each other lots of secrets!

00:59.400 --> 01:02.840
&lrm;And what kind of zombies will you be
&lrm;at the amusement park, tomorrow,

01:02.960 --> 01:04.120
&lrm;if you go to bed late?

01:04.239 --> 01:09.560
&lrm;-Show 'em, Marinette.
&lrm;-Yawn... um... um...

01:09.680 --> 01:13.520
&lrm;So what's it gonna be? Boring,
&lrm;sit-down pyjama party with the big kids,

01:13.640 --> 01:16.000
&lrm;or the super-fun amusement park tomorrow?

01:16.120 --> 01:19.280
&lrm;The amusement park!

01:19.400 --> 01:21.680
&lrm;That's what I thought.
&lrm;Good night, Sapotis.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.560
&lrm;Wait, can we keep them on, please?

01:24.680 --> 01:28.000
&lrm;All right. But go to sleep now!

01:34.000 --> 01:36.640
&lrm;You have the technique down
&lrm;with your sisters!

01:36.760 --> 01:39.560
&lrm;But, uh, who are the Sapi... Sapo...

01:39.680 --> 01:42.960
&lrm;The Sapotis? They're little monsters
&lrm;from a Creole fable

01:43.080 --> 01:46.040
&lrm;who are always pulling pranks
&lrm;and making mischief.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.840
&lrm;Now we're alone, I can tell you.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.480
&lrm;Ladybug has been around
&lrm;since the Pharaohs.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.400
&lrm;But no way can the Ladybug
&lrm;we know be 5,000 years old!

01:53.520 --> 01:58.120
&lrm;So, I downloaded a great app that analysed
&lrm;recordings I had of her talking.

01:58.240 --> 02:03.680
&lrm;Based on the frequencies of her voice,
&lrm;it turns out she's a girl our age!

02:03.800 --> 02:06.000
&lrm;Uh, Alya... the orange juice?

02:06.120 --> 02:09.199
&lrm;[giggling]

02:09.320 --> 02:10.000
&lrm;[groans]

02:10.120 --> 02:12.920
&lrm;It's not us! It's the Sapotis!

02:13.040 --> 02:14.640
&lrm;[giggle]

02:17.520 --> 02:20.200
&lrm;-What were we saying, again?
&lrm;-Uh...

02:20.320 --> 02:23.040
&lrm;We were about to watch a movie!

02:25.560 --> 02:28.560
&lrm;Oh, yeah, Ladybug!
&lrm;She's like a high-school girl!

02:28.680 --> 02:32.600
&lrm;So, to figure out who she is, we need to
&lrm;find a girl our age, who's always late...

02:32.720 --> 02:36.840
&lrm;Don't you think there's a good reason
&lrm;why she keeps her identity a secret?

02:39.320 --> 02:40.920
&lrm;All right, that's enough!

02:41.040 --> 02:44.720
&lrm;Get outta bed one more time
&lrm;and no one will go to the park tomorrow!

02:44.840 --> 02:50.560
&lrm;-Ha, ha! It's not us, it's...
&lrm;-This is your last warning. No joke!

02:56.320 --> 02:57.880
&lrm;What were you saying about her identity?

02:58.360 --> 03:00.320
&lrm;She needs it to protect her friends.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.240
&lrm;Otherwise,
&lrm;the villains could use them to get to her.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.200
&lrm;-Argh!
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha!

03:09.320 --> 03:11.440
&lrm;-It's not us, it's...
&lrm;-That's it!

03:11.560 --> 03:14.560
&lrm;Come on, Alya! We won't do it again!

03:14.680 --> 03:19.480
&lrm;Yeah? Well, it's too late!
&lrm;We'll go to the park when you can behave!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.800
&lrm;Now, go to sleep!

03:25.720 --> 03:30.040
&lrm;"I don't want another peep out of you!"
&lrm;"Wash your hands!" "Clean your room!"

03:30.160 --> 03:33.200
&lrm;Kids should be able to do
&lrm;whatever they want to do,

03:33.320 --> 03:35.800
&lrm;however they want to do it.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.760
&lrm;Fly, my evil little one,
&lrm;and akumatise them!

03:49.400 --> 03:53.240
&lrm;Well, if I knew who Ladybug really was,
&lrm;I'd keep it a secret.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.840
&lrm;I would even help her. Like, say,
&lrm;if&lrm;<i> you</i>&lrm; were Ladybug, I'd cover for you

03:57.960 --> 04:01.560
&lrm;when you needed to transform in school,
&lrm;go fight the baddies, you know?

04:01.680 --> 04:06.000
&lrm;Oh, yeah? Well, if I was Ladybug,
&lrm;I wouldn't even tell you,

04:06.120 --> 04:08.600
&lrm;to protect you from the baddies, you know?

04:08.720 --> 04:11.960
&lrm;You serious?
&lrm;If I was Ladybug, I'd totally tell you,

04:12.080 --> 04:15.040
&lrm;because I tell my best friend everything!

04:15.160 --> 04:19.279
&lrm;You're right, Alya, you should
&lrm;always tell your best friend everything.

04:19.399 --> 04:23.120
&lrm;So, come on, spill the beans,
&lrm;are you actually Ladybug?

04:23.640 --> 04:25.880
&lrm;Right, like I'm telling you! Nah-ah!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.760
&lrm;[laughter]

04:28.880 --> 04:31.280
&lrm;-It's mine!
&lrm;-No, this one's mine!

04:31.400 --> 04:33.360
&lrm;No, it's mine!

04:36.240 --> 04:41.640
&lrm;Sapotis, I am Hawk Moth.
&lrm;Your big sister's telling you what to do?

04:41.760 --> 04:44.440
&lrm;Well, I'll let you be
&lrm;as mischievous as you want!

04:44.560 --> 04:48.640
&lrm;And do whatever we want? Like stay up
&lrm;all night and go to the movies?

04:48.760 --> 04:52.920
&lrm;And eat lots of desserts, drink orange
&lrm;juice and still go to the amusement park?

04:53.040 --> 04:58.280
&lrm;Yes, yes. But calm down! From now on,
&lrm;no one will ever be able to punish you,

04:58.880 --> 05:02.160
&lrm;because it will always be
&lrm;another Sapoti's fault.

05:02.280 --> 05:06.640
&lrm;All you have to do is to take
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous

05:06.760 --> 05:10.680
&lrm;and give them to your good friend,
&lrm;Hawk Moth. OK?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.680
&lrm;OK!

05:15.640 --> 05:17.200
&lrm;[wild laughter]

05:17.320 --> 05:20.080
&lrm;That's it!
&lrm;I've totally had it with these kids!

05:20.480 --> 05:22.520
&lrm;Don't even try to blame this on the...

05:24.520 --> 05:27.120
&lrm;-Sapotis?
&lrm;-Yaah!

05:28.400 --> 05:31.160
&lrm;Maybe you were
&lrm;a little too strict with them.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.960
&lrm;[wild screams]

05:33.080 --> 05:36.520
&lrm;Normally when you're firm with kids
&lrm;they don't turn into monsters!

05:43.160 --> 05:47.200
&lrm;-They're multiplying after they eat! Aaah!
&lrm;-Window!

05:48.320 --> 05:50.800
&lrm;Marinette, the window!
&lrm;We can't let them out!

05:57.880 --> 05:59.640
&lrm;Marinette, take care of these two!

05:59.760 --> 06:01.240
&lrm;We've got to bring them back!

06:07.760 --> 06:09.560
&lrm;Time to transform!

06:09.880 --> 06:12.720
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

06:30.400 --> 06:32.520
&lrm;-To the airport!
&lrm;-Rock'n'roll!

06:33.160 --> 06:34.400
&lrm;Hey! What's going on?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.600
&lrm;Drive! Drive!

06:41.040 --> 06:42.720
&lrm;[evil laugh]

06:42.840 --> 06:46.680
&lrm;On your left, &lrm;<i>l'académie des beaux arts</i>&lrm;,
&lrm;and on your right, the Louvre museum!

06:51.640 --> 06:52.920
&lrm;[whistling]

06:53.040 --> 06:55.840
&lrm;Trompette!

06:55.960 --> 06:59.840
&lrm;<i>These miniature monsters seem to be</i>
&lrm;<i>attacking more and more people. Aaah!</i>

07:00.800 --> 07:03.440
&lrm;[indistinct chatter]

07:03.560 --> 07:05.840
&lrm;I think we'd better take care of this.
&lrm;Plagg?

07:06.480 --> 07:09.280
&lrm;Food thieves are real dangers!
&lrm;What are you waiting for?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.280
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

07:28.000 --> 07:29.320
&lrm;[wild laughter]

07:30.640 --> 07:33.800
&lrm;-It's forbidden...
&lrm;-..to play around with traffic lights!

07:34.640 --> 07:37.040
&lrm;-You're just in time, kitty!
&lrm;-Mine!

07:38.800 --> 07:40.680
&lrm;How did you know
&lrm;to destroy the hat?

07:40.800 --> 07:44.240
&lrm;-I, uh... trial and error!
&lrm;-But no akuma's been released.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.280
&lrm;No, 'cause that monster was a clone.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.680
&lrm;These Sapotis multiply
&lrm;every time they eat.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.400
&lrm;To get to the akuma,
&lrm;we must destroy the original one,

07:52.760 --> 07:55.760
&lrm;the very first one Hawk Moth akumatised.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.560
&lrm;-So you mean we've got to catch 'em all?
&lrm;-I thought you liked a good challenge!

07:59.680 --> 08:00.640
&lrm;Ugh!

08:03.840 --> 08:04.920
&lrm;Aaah!

08:23.960 --> 08:27.320
&lrm;Hey, don't eat that ice cream
&lrm;or things will get catastrophic!

08:27.440 --> 08:28.720
&lrm;Seize their Miraculous!

08:40.080 --> 08:42.880
&lrm;We can't destroy their hats!
&lrm;There's too many of them!

08:43.000 --> 08:44.600
&lrm;Miraculous!

08:47.040 --> 08:49.120
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

08:53.640 --> 08:56.520
&lrm;-A teapot?
&lrm;-It's strangely familiar.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.280
&lrm;It's weird! I can't find anything!

09:01.400 --> 09:03.560
&lrm;Hurry up! My Kung fu is not enough!

09:04.040 --> 09:06.760
&lrm;Of course! I know someone who can help!
&lrm;Gotta go!

09:06.880 --> 09:09.400
&lrm;-Right now? Can't it wait?
&lrm;-No, it can't!

09:09.520 --> 09:13.040
&lrm;-You gotta trust me on this one.
&lrm;-Go on, Milady!

09:16.680 --> 09:17.560
&lrm;[knock on door]

09:17.680 --> 09:18.520
&lrm;It's open.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.080
&lrm;-Hello, Master Fu.
&lrm;-Hello, Marinette.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.440
&lrm;Marinette? But, you're not supposed
&lrm;to come to Master Fu's place!

09:25.560 --> 09:26.760
&lrm;Let her talk, Wayzz.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.520
&lrm;Master, I used my Lucky Charm,
&lrm;but, strangely,

09:29.640 --> 09:32.480
&lrm;I think it was a hint,
&lrm;which was telling me to come here.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.400
&lrm;I see.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.960
&lrm;Marinette. I taught you all about
&lrm;the Miraculous and their powers.

09:38.520 --> 09:41.120
&lrm;You know that yours
&lrm;works in a very mysterious way.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.120
&lrm;I think it's trying to tell us
&lrm;that you need help this time.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.640
&lrm;I don't know if it's safe.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.600
&lrm;I already took an enormous risk by putting
&lrm;two Miraculous into circulation.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.520
&lrm;And you were right to do it!
&lrm;Cat Noir and I are very careful.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.280
&lrm;Hmm.

10:08.880 --> 10:13.320
&lrm;Marinette, pick up an ally you can trust
&lrm;to fight alongside you in this mission.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.280
&lrm;-Wow!
&lrm;-Choose wisely.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.360
&lrm;Such powers are meant to serve
&lrm;the greater good.

10:20.480 --> 10:24.680
&lrm;-They must never get into the wrong hands.
&lrm;-Like Hawk Moth's.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.320
&lrm;Yes. Once the mission is over,
&lrm;you must retrieve the Miraculous from them

10:29.440 --> 10:30.360
&lrm;and bring it back to me.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.960
&lrm;Until we've unlocked all the secrets,

10:34.080 --> 10:38.840
&lrm;it's too dangerous to allow any more
&lrm;Miraculous to be out in the open for long.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.600
&lrm;Is there anyone you can think of,
&lrm;Marinette?

10:48.160 --> 10:51.160
&lrm;Yes, Master. I know just the right person.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.440
&lrm;Hmm.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.640
&lrm;Listen, we can renegotiate
&lrm;the amusement-park idea if you want, OK?

10:56.760 --> 10:59.640
&lrm;But first, I need you to chill out
&lrm;and come back home with me!

11:06.840 --> 11:09.280
&lrm;Ladybug! My sisters have been akumatised!

11:09.400 --> 11:11.040
&lrm;I need to bring them home.

11:11.160 --> 11:14.600
&lrm;There's a way to find your sisters,
&lrm;but we'll need your help. You interested?

11:15.120 --> 11:18.120
&lrm;Me, help you superheroes? You bet I am!

11:18.240 --> 11:21.680
&lrm;-Just wait till I tell Marinette!
&lrm;-Hold on now, this has to be a secret.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.640
&lrm;Not a word to anyone!

11:24.240 --> 11:27.720
&lrm;-Oh! Right! Understood!
&lrm;-Alya Césaire,

11:27.840 --> 11:31.760
&lrm;here is the Miraculous of the Fox,
&lrm;which grants the power of illusion.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.200
&lrm;You will use it for the greater good.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.960
&lrm;Once the job is done, you will return
&lrm;the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?

11:40.080 --> 11:41.520
&lrm;Totally, Ladybug.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.520
&lrm;What is that thing?

11:49.960 --> 11:53.840
&lrm;I am not a thing!
&lrm;My name is Trixx, and I am your kwami.

11:53.960 --> 11:58.520
&lrm;My "kwami"? I know! You're what gives
&lrm;superheroes their superpowers! Right?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.760
&lrm;-Not bad!
&lrm;-She's an expert!

12:01.880 --> 12:04.840
&lrm;Mind Blown! By the way, how old are you?

12:04.960 --> 12:07.040
&lrm;Do you have any idea who Cat Noir is?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.840
&lrm;-Stay focused, Alya!
&lrm;-Sorry, Ladybug.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.080
&lrm;Ready to become a superhero?

12:14.200 --> 12:18.840
&lrm;You just need to say one thing,
&lrm;"Trixx, let's pounce!"

12:18.960 --> 12:20.720
&lrm;Trixx, let's pounce!

12:34.760 --> 12:36.160
&lrm;This is so awesome!

12:36.280 --> 12:39.400
&lrm;But I look like Lila
&lrm;when she has been akumatised in this suit!

12:39.520 --> 12:43.520
&lrm;Yes, but the superhero version! Come on,
&lrm;I'll explain the rest to you on the way.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.840
&lrm;Wow! This is so cool!

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
&lrm;Mission first!

13:08.440 --> 13:09.520
&lrm;Huh?

13:17.280 --> 13:21.720
&lrm;-What's taking so long, Ladybug?
&lrm;-There! Take his Miraculous from him!

13:24.280 --> 13:26.360
&lrm;Aaah!

13:39.640 --> 13:43.360
&lrm;This is so insane! I've got powers
&lrm;and I'm fighting supervillains.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.920
&lrm;Whoa!
&lrm;Who is this superhero friend of yours?

13:50.040 --> 13:52.320
&lrm;No offence,
&lrm;but I thought I was the only one!

13:52.440 --> 13:54.760
&lrm;Cat Noir, I'd like you to meet... uh...

13:54.880 --> 13:58.960
&lrm;Uh... Rena Rouge!
&lrm;Yeah, my name is Rena Rouge!

13:59.080 --> 14:02.560
&lrm;Well, sneaky fox,
&lrm;think you'll be as sneaky as a cat?

14:02.680 --> 14:05.840
&lrm;-I dunno. Should we take bets?
&lrm;-Your friend seems pretty good!

14:05.960 --> 14:09.720
&lrm;-I surround myself with only the best!
&lrm;-Welcome to our team.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.560
&lrm;If you need any superhero tips,
&lrm;you know where to come.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.520
&lrm;Really? You're gonna give me
&lrm;Ladybug's phone number?

14:15.640 --> 14:18.720
&lrm;I have a feeling working with you
&lrm;is gonna be a lot of fun!

14:18.840 --> 14:24.840
&lrm;A new hero. So I was right. There are
&lrm;indeed other Miraculous in the city.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.720
&lrm;Sapotis, listen to me!
&lrm;Three superheroes are nothing against you!

14:28.840 --> 14:30.680
&lrm;There are enough of you
&lrm;to destroy everything!

14:30.800 --> 14:34.880
&lrm;So band together and take their Miraculous
&lrm;or I'll remove your powers

14:35.000 --> 14:37.040
&lrm;and there'll be no more mischief!

14:41.800 --> 14:44.320
&lrm;-We're surrounded!
&lrm;-We're retreating!

14:51.640 --> 14:53.360
&lrm;There must be thousands of them!

14:54.080 --> 14:55.960
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

15:00.640 --> 15:01.600
&lrm;An unicycle?

15:15.440 --> 15:17.840
&lrm;Whenever you're ready, Milady!

15:24.720 --> 15:28.240
&lrm;Rakes, unicycle wheel,
&lrm;traffic cone, tape, trash can...

15:28.360 --> 15:32.880
&lrm;-Do you always make it this complicated?
&lrm;-Trust me, Rena Rouge.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.040
&lrm;Here we go!

15:47.520 --> 15:52.200
&lrm;Hear ye! Hear ye!
&lrm;Sapoti-Land is about to open!

15:52.320 --> 15:55.440
&lrm;Mischief of all sizes
&lrm;are permitted in Sapoti-Land!

15:55.560 --> 15:58.320
&lrm;All-you-can-eat desserts!
&lrm;Fountains of orange juice!

15:58.440 --> 16:00.400
&lrm;Big-kid movies and video games!

16:02.080 --> 16:03.840
&lrm;All right, Rena Rouge!
&lrm;Time to use your power!

16:04.200 --> 16:06.160
&lrm;I've never tried it. Hope it works!

16:06.280 --> 16:09.960
&lrm;Just think of the illusion
&lrm;you want to create. Stay focused!

16:14.400 --> 16:15.800
&lrm;Mirage!

16:24.680 --> 16:26.120
&lrm;Awesome!

16:28.280 --> 16:31.880
&lrm;My necklace is flashing! Um,
&lrm;that means I'll change back soon, right?

16:32.000 --> 16:35.160
&lrm;Yeah, but it's OK if I see who you are.
&lrm;I can keep a secret.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.960
&lrm;Naughty kitty! You know very well
&lrm;that our identities must remain secret!

16:40.080 --> 16:42.160
&lrm;Good job! You're a fast learner!

16:42.280 --> 16:44.760
&lrm;If you need superhero tips,
&lrm;you know where to come!

16:44.880 --> 16:48.920
&lrm;Follow me and I'll take you to
&lrm;Sapoti-Land, where there's no bedtime,

16:49.040 --> 16:50.200
&lrm;where everything goes!

16:50.320 --> 16:51.880
&lrm;Sapoti-Land!

16:52.000 --> 16:55.600
&lrm;No, wait! Don't go there!
&lrm;Ladybug's trying to trap you!

17:01.120 --> 17:03.640
&lrm;Phase two, Cat Noir. Now!

17:04.880 --> 17:08.119
&lrm;Step right up! Step right up!
&lrm;The Sapotis get in for free!

17:08.240 --> 17:11.599
&lrm;-All the Sapotis are in the alley.
&lrm;-Is this really gonna work?

17:11.720 --> 17:14.400
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;Sometimes it's more absurd than this!

17:17.640 --> 17:18.640
&lrm;Your turn, Ladybug!

17:31.720 --> 17:33.800
&lrm;We've got all the hats, Ladybug!

17:35.280 --> 17:37.040
&lrm;Cataclysm!

17:56.000 --> 17:58.320
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

18:02.280 --> 18:04.560
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:07.480 --> 18:08.440
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:09.920 --> 18:11.920
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

18:12.040 --> 18:14.120
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:19.720 --> 18:20.720
&lrm;Pound it!

18:25.280 --> 18:26.680
&lrm;Ett...

18:26.800 --> 18:29.840
&lrm;Uh... Gotta get going,
&lrm;uh, before I transform back.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.920
&lrm;Looking forward
&lrm;to fighting with you again, Rena Rouge!

18:33.760 --> 18:35.400
&lrm;-I'll join you.
&lrm;-Bye, kitty!

18:35.520 --> 18:36.520
&lrm;Miaow.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.160
&lrm;Can you make sure the two girls
&lrm;get back home safely?

18:40.840 --> 18:44.280
&lrm;-OK, who's gonna tell me where you live?
&lrm;-I will! Ha, ha!

18:46.480 --> 18:49.880
&lrm;You and your friends
&lrm;have defeated me this time, Ladybug,

18:50.000 --> 18:54.120
&lrm;but thanks to you, now I know
&lrm;there are other Miraculous in Paris,

18:54.240 --> 18:57.520
&lrm;and, most likely, a Guardian.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.520
&lrm;That was unreal!

19:06.920 --> 19:09.400
&lrm;You really helped us a lot.
&lrm;Thank you, Alya.

19:13.480 --> 19:17.960
&lrm;You know, if I held onto it,
&lrm;I could help you again.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.200
&lrm;-You made a promise.
&lrm;-Oh, please, Ladybug.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.520
&lrm;We'd make a great team!
&lrm;I could help Cat Noir and you every day!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.560
&lrm;-I'm about to transform back. Hurry!
&lrm;-Please!

19:29.120 --> 19:31.400
&lrm;I have to go. I'm trusting you.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.720
&lrm;You're absolutely right, Alya.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.200
&lrm;The three of you
&lrm;would make quite the team!

19:38.320 --> 19:42.080
&lrm;You have all the makings of a true
&lrm;superhero. You're strong, brave,

19:42.200 --> 19:44.320
&lrm;but, most of all, you're trustworthy.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.560
&lrm;You made the right choice, Marinette.
&lrm;Thanks to you,

20:06.680 --> 20:10.120
&lrm;Paris has been saved from evil, yet again.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.720
&lrm;[door bell rings]

20:12.560 --> 20:14.120
&lrm;Marinette! Are you OK?

20:14.240 --> 20:16.880
&lrm;I called you tons of times.
&lrm;Why weren't you answering?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.120
&lrm;Wait till you hear!
&lrm;Something crazy happened to me!

20:20.240 --> 20:26.800
&lrm;-Really? What happened?
&lrm;-I... Uh... Well... My battery died!

20:26.920 --> 20:30.400
&lrm;Can you believe it?
&lrm;My brand new phone! Super let down, huh!

20:32.280 --> 20:34.160
&lrm;I'm just glad you're safe!

20:34.280 --> 20:35.440
&lrm;Ditto!

20:37.480 --> 20:40.240
&lrm;Keep the noise down.
&lrm;My sisters are asleep, at last!

20:40.360 --> 20:43.400
&lrm;Phew! All's well that ends well.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.280
&lrm;Thanks to Ladybug and Cat Noir!

20:45.400 --> 20:48.920
&lrm;I heard they had another superhero
&lrm;with them tonight. A girl!

20:49.040 --> 20:54.480
&lrm;Oh, no! Seriously?
&lrm;I had no idea! Who was it?

20:54.600 --> 20:56.280
&lrm;Weren't we going to watch a movie?

20:56.400 --> 21:00.000
&lrm;Oh, come on! Please! Did you see her?
&lrm;Did you at least know what her name was?

21:00.400 --> 21:03.560
&lrm;What did she look like?
&lrm;Come on, girl, tell me everything!

21:07.440 --> 21:10.320
&lrm;[lively music]
