00:42.251 --> 00:45.243
These are the secrets.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.246
Of the night.

00:51.260 --> 00:54.252
The stories are hidden.

00:54.263 --> 00:57.255
From our sight.

01:09.278 --> 01:12.190
It dances deep.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.940
Within the wind.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.445
As shadows fade.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.949
The fight begins.

01:37.723 --> 01:41.716
Love, love takes it
love, love breaks it.

01:42.227 --> 01:46.721
Love, love hates promises
made in the dark.

01:46.732 --> 01:51.226
Love, love takes it
love, love breaks it.

01:51.236 --> 01:56.731
Love, love hates promises
made in the dark.

01:56.742 --> 02:01.987
The hour's late
the time draws near.

02:05.125 --> 02:11.621
It stirs the dreams
hides my fears.

02:14.009 --> 02:19.003
Love, love takes it
love, love breaks it.

02:19.014 --> 02:23.383
Love, love hates promises
made in the dark.

02:23.393 --> 02:27.932
Love, love takes it
love, love breaks it.

02:27.939 --> 02:32.979
Love, love hates promises
made in the dark

04:34.107 --> 04:36.098
Eddie? Eddie?

05:02.511 --> 05:06.504
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have change for a five?

05:07.015 --> 05:09.006
Sure.

05:26.910 --> 05:31.404
Yo, yo, yo, yo. Come on.
Come on. Mick. Mick.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.909
It's a little late for you
to be out alone, isn't it?

05:42.050 --> 05:45.042
Well, I'm, uh, not alone.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.425
You're here.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.930
That's right.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.442
But I wouldn't be if my car wasn't
in the shop. You know how it is.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.321
Let's go inside
and have a drink.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.573
I'll call a cab.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.956
It's in my pocket...
Left-hand pocket.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.459
Frankie.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.961
She's pretty, isn't she? Lech.

06:29.973 --> 06:34.592
- Be bop a lula she's my baby.
- Yo, Nick!

06:34.728 --> 06:36.844
Be bop a lula thanks.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.724
Rain from heaven.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.851
You sprayed it in my eyes!

06:49.993 --> 06:51.984
Nick, you all right, man?
I can't seel

06:51.995 --> 06:54.486
Nick, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.990
Asshole. Jesus Christ.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.992
I'm blind. Sorry, man.

07:01.004 --> 07:04.121
- You're a real samurai, you know.
- Get out of herel

07:04.633 --> 07:08.125
did you get the money?
Mickey, shut up for once.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.885
Well, of course
I'm worried, Brian.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.887
You know what your brother
did with his last term.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.142
And what I hear about
the new school,

07:25.153 --> 07:29.146
it's only gonna positively
reinforce all of his old bad habits.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.149
And this neighborhood
isn't any help either.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.652
Because it just gives him
an excuse to fail.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.155
What? That's terrific.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.657
No, no, no, don't bring anything.
Just yourself.

07:40.669 --> 07:45.163
- Yeah.
- Tell me all about...

08:18.081 --> 08:20.072
Oooh.

08:32.511 --> 08:36.004
How was the night? Not bad.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.008
Hey, there you are. First day at
a new school. You ready for it?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.510
Aren't I always? I guess.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.011
You'd better get going.
It's getting late. Sleep well, dad.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.390
Okay.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.652
I stood there I waited.

08:58.663 --> 09:02.155
For those high school days.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.536
Little bit.

09:07.547 --> 09:13.167
I feel this whole world's on fire
and I don't wanna get real burned.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.170
But I'm not gonna stand
in line no more

09:16.181 --> 09:18.172
I'm gonna step out.

09:37.327 --> 09:41.821
Oh, god, I swear I would just love to
find that guy from last night.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.823
I would just take that... watch your
mouth, scumbag, will ya?

09:46.836 --> 09:49.327
Hey, you watch your mouth.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.330
Hey, lust puppy.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.332
Lust puppy?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.339
Hey.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.842
Hey!

10:03.853 --> 10:06.344
Hey, you. Get over here.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.472
There's no bike riding
on campus.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.474
I was just hoping I could take
a quick ride through history.

10:11.986 --> 10:16.229
- You can pick it up after school. Park it in the rack.
- Yes, sir.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.234
Frankie, come on, all right.
I'll be there.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.487
Walk it over!

10:27.502 --> 10:29.993
Ever shoot anybody
with that thing?

10:37.011 --> 10:40.503
All right,
no drinking on campus.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.391
Nick, think we ought to do it?

10:53.403 --> 10:55.894
Hey, just chill. Chill, man.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.898
I think we're going to school.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.658
Frankie.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.677
Miss Wright. Morning, Howard.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.180
My mother said it was okay for me to
stay out of biology class today...

11:32.192 --> 11:34.183
On account
of my sinus condition.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.686
All those chemicals
kind of makes me sick.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.188
Then have your mother
take the class.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.691
We have to have someone
sitting in your chair. But...

11:42.702 --> 11:46.945
You'll be late for class, Howard.
Aw, man!

11:49.459 --> 11:52.451
Hey, babe. Mmm, mama. What's up?

11:52.462 --> 11:54.953
Not much. How you doing? Good.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.455
What's his story?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.959
Who cares? His ass is grass now.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.463
Let me have your blade.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.468
You'll never use it. Come on.
Maybe I wanna clean my teeth.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.470
Let me have it.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.851
- Be careful.
- Hiller.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.353
Hiller.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.359
Hiller! Come into my office.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.995
Later.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.501
You mind taking those off?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.503
I like to see
who I'm talking to.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.892
Shakespeare, huh? Yeah.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.394
Actually, I don't know
why I'm surprised.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.898
Your records show a good
aptitude for reading and writing.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.901
Going to do anything with it?

13:09.914 --> 13:12.530
Excuse me?

13:13.543 --> 13:16.535
I don't know.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.536
Look, Morgan,

13:19.048 --> 13:21.539
you've had a good education in one of
the best prep schools in this country.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.667
And if you chose
to throw it away, well,

13:24.053 --> 13:27.045
luckily that's no concern
of mine at this point.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.549
What is my concern
is your present attitude,

13:30.560 --> 13:35.429
which is my way of saying that I won't
tolerate any of your past bullshit.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.432
Including your rooftop...

13:38.568 --> 13:43.562
Rock concerts
in-between the classes.

13:43.573 --> 13:48.567
You see, I have a lot of trouble dealing
with the real losers here at Lawson.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.945
I don't want to waste a lot
of energy with a good imitation.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.197
Yes, sir.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.199
Good. All right.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.703
You'd better hustle out of here
before you miss your first class.

14:04.594 --> 14:08.086
And so the original pioneers
settled the territory...

14:08.097 --> 14:10.588
Building towns on the lands
they claimed.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.342
But there were men who lived
outside the law.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.847
Men who took away the things the
settlers had worked so hard to build.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.348
The settlers themselves
were no match for these outlaws,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.851
and so a new breed was born.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.107
Known as the "gunfighters,"
they brought a new code...

14:29.118 --> 14:31.609
Of honor and justice
to the old west.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.988
A code written in their blood and of
the blood of the outlaws they faced.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.617
Bat Masterson. Wyatt earp.

14:44.634 --> 14:48.502
- Whoa. State of the art.
- Class, that's enough.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.132
Ed, will you please watch
the film and pay attention?

14:59.649 --> 15:02.015
Sorry, man. I never had it
out of my pocket before.

15:02.026 --> 15:05.518
Yeah? Well, why don't you learn how to
use it before you cut your balls off?

15:05.530 --> 15:08.021
No settler could remain in
those days without taking sides.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.524
Problems, Jimmy?

15:11.035 --> 15:14.527
No, uh... no problems.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.534
Can't get the damn thing closed.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.536
Looking back, one is struck
by the fact that even though...

15:24.048 --> 15:26.039
Specific crimes
are frequently forgotten,

15:26.050 --> 15:29.042
the romantic pageantry remains.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.045
- Here. You're gonna need it.
- Why?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.547
Take it. It's all over the
school about you and Nick hauser.

15:34.559 --> 15:38.051
Heads up, Jimmy. Heads up.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.553
Something important, Mr. Parker?

15:40.565 --> 15:43.807
Yeah. I was telling Morgan
about this book I read.

15:43.818 --> 15:48.061
- Which one?
- Call of the wild.

15:48.072 --> 15:53.192
And, um, what was your reaction to
this once-in-a-lifetime experience?

15:53.202 --> 15:55.693
I didn't get it.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.823
But I liked the dog.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.999
History books are filled
with stories about lands...

16:02.211 --> 16:05.091
Bought and paid for with the blood of
the men and women who claimed them.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.705
When someone took a stand,
they very often paid with their life,

16:07.717 --> 16:09.833
whether outlaw or gunfighter.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.835
The cost was always high.

16:11.846 --> 16:15.338
And many lives were given by those
who shaped our beloved country...

16:15.850 --> 16:18.592
During this turbulent
and historic era.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.597
Pow!

16:23.608 --> 16:26.600
What's up, man? You like music?

16:26.611 --> 16:28.602
Yeah, I like music. Yeah?

16:28.613 --> 16:32.105
Wanna come see my band tonight?
Sure. Where?

16:32.116 --> 16:35.608
Go down here, down this main drag,
past all the sleazy porno shops.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.612
Okay. It's on the left-hand side.
You can't miss it.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.615
Porno shops?
I'll be there. Good.

16:43.878 --> 16:48.372
All right, let's get this thing rolling!
Come on, man.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.374
Yo, Nick! Be bop a lula.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.876
Whoa! He just missed 'em, man.

16:53.888 --> 16:58.131
This must be recess, right?
Great.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.765
Yo, Morgan. Yo! Wait up.

17:07.777 --> 17:11.269
Listen, man. You're heading towards
trouble. That's Nick hauser.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.272
They're playing with my bike.
I'm just trying to save your life.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.825
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Nice hood ornament you got there.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.332
Hey, don't mess with them.
They'll break your legs.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.212
There he is. There he is.
Right there.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.469
Hi there. Hi.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.235
God, a real man wouldn't
jump out of the way.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.988
Whoa. Yeah.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.491
It's John Wayne.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.374
Guy's got a damn death wish.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.876
Eddie, there he goes, man.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.879
Watch out. He's gonna kiss you.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.758
This is a very nice bike.
Very nice. We like it.

18:31.027 --> 18:35.521
We're just taking it for a test run.
You don't mind? Wanna make sure it works.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.149
Rain from heaven, maricon.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.536
Hey. Look at this guy.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.539
I think he's got the measles
or something.

18:58.054 --> 19:01.672
Come on! Show us!

19:03.809 --> 19:07.301
So, what do you think?
Should we let him have it?

19:07.813 --> 19:11.305
What? I said,
should we let him have it?

19:12.318 --> 19:14.309
You want your bike back?

19:14.820 --> 19:17.311
Huh? H? Hey, b &, ebop.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.063
You want your bike back?

19:19.575 --> 19:22.066
What do you think?
Should I give him his bike back here?

19:22.078 --> 19:25.445
Make him pay!

19:25.456 --> 19:29.449
Should I give him his bike back?
I said, should I give him his bike back?

19:31.337 --> 19:34.079
Give it back to him, Nick.
Keep it.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.711
There it is.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.590
Come on.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.597
Good.

19:52.608 --> 19:56.601
You look beautiful like that.
Red really looks great on you.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.390
Oh, shit.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.665
It was a nice bike!

21:10.686 --> 21:15.180
Hey, you guys... you guys are bad.
This was a nice bike.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.182
Used to be.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.184
Damn.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.192
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.696
I guess training was over.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.699
Hey, he said he was sorry.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.202
Life's a bitch, pal.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.710
Party's over.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.474
Shit.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.979
Hi, honey.
How was the first day?

22:04.990 --> 22:06.981
Okay.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.989
What happened to your bike?
Nothing.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.992
Nothing?

22:18.504 --> 22:21.496
Your bike is in pieces and
you tell me nothing happened?

22:21.507 --> 22:23.998
All right, Morgan,
if it's starting all over again...

22:24.009 --> 22:27.501
It's not starting again,
okay? It was an accident.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.504
All right?
No, it's not all right.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.881
Who's gonna pay for that?

22:32.017 --> 22:35.509
- Did you at least find out if they have any insurance?
- Insurance?

22:35.896 --> 22:38.387
This isn't Connecticut!
No one has insurance around here.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.890
Oh, now they don't even have insurance.
That's wonderfull

22:41.402 --> 22:42.892
hey, hey, what's going in here?

22:43.404 --> 22:45.395
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.898
It seems that we had a little
accident with Morgan's bike.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.900
Oh, boy. Can you fix it?

22:50.911 --> 22:52.911
As soon as I learn to walk
on water I'll get on it.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.905
Don't you take that tone
of voice with your father!

22:55.916 --> 22:58.908
That bike cost $500! No shit.

22:58.919 --> 23:03.413
Morgan. You handle this.
I don't want any more to do with it.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.916
What the hell am I
supposed to say to that?

23:06.927 --> 23:08.918
I've been at this thing
for two hours.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.420
You might be a little more
understanding of her.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.924
Well, dad, you know,
I've been working on that my whole life.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.192
It's too late.

23:33.704 --> 23:37.697
To fall in love with Sharon Tate.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.950
But it's too soon.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.078
But the bull is gonna dance in
the brain of reverend moon.

23:46.216 --> 23:50.710
I think that it's time that you're
startin' to think about getting by.

23:50.721 --> 23:54.714
But I have that need
to go out and find.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.592
Somebody to love.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.097
Very kind. Thank you.
Thank you very much!

24:04.610 --> 24:07.101
It's too late.

24:07.112 --> 24:12.106
There's no one left
that I even wanna imitate.

24:12.117 --> 24:17.612
But it's too soon to ask me for
the words I want carved on my tomb.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.115
So I think that it's time.

24:21.126 --> 24:25.119
That you're all startin'
to think about gettin' by.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.622
But I have that need
to go and rely on.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.626
Somebody to love.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.640
You just don't know

24:46.902 --> 24:50.645
I'm here to give you my heart
and you want some fashion show.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.148
So I think it's time.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.901
'Cause I think
it's too easy to rely.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.779
On worshiping devils
and strangers in bed.

24:59.790 --> 25:03.783
Though they do get good drugs
and they do give good head.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.292
Please, god, if you're up there,
just let him see me.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.295
Come on, Ronnie.
Jimmy isn't your type.

25:16.306 --> 25:20.299
Maybe if you moved the hair out of
your eyes, you'd see how wrong you are.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.459
Pain in my heart, there he is.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.976
Thank you. Thank you.

26:11.987 --> 26:15.479
We'll be back in a bit with more
tales from the crypt. Thank you.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.140
Nice dress.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.811
So where's he from? Connecticut.

26:56.323 --> 27:00.316
Connecticut.
What do you do for fun back there?

27:00.327 --> 27:03.319
Met at the yacht club
every Sunday.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.322
Is he serious?
Never as far as I can tell.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.824
I was, actually.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.827
Have a good set. All right.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.079
Excuse me.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.468
One, two, three, four!

27:31.233 --> 27:34.725
Hey, let go of me.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.227
Who do you think you are, huh?

27:38.740 --> 27:41.231
Let go of me! Not until you
tell me what your name is.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.359
That's my business.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.864
Bobby takes the gas
pedal to the floor.

27:47.875 --> 27:52.869
The voices he hears the voices.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.371
Coming from the traffic
coming from the cube.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.873
Like the cry of babies
passing through a tube.

27:57.885 --> 28:00.877
Voices run inside you.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.507
There's gonna be trouble.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.509
Jill breathes carbon
trailing from the bus.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.511
It's like staring
in the eyes of Lazarus.

28:10.772 --> 28:14.640
The voices she hears the voices.

28:14.651 --> 28:18.018
Like a starving whisper
no one ever heard.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.022
Like an epileptic hummingbird.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.524
Let me go!
The voices she hears the voices.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.404
Coming from the traffic
coming from the cube.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.656
Like the cry of babies
passing through a tube.

28:31.043 --> 28:35.036
Voices run inside you.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.916
Sal and Liz sitting at the zoo.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.795
Sal says I do but, Liz, do you.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.798
Yo, man, look at that.
Talk about balls.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.802
You don't understand.
Then enlighten me.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.182
They hear all the voices.

28:56.693 --> 29:00.060
Coming from the traffic
coming from the cube.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.188
Like the cry of babies
passing through a tube.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.691
Voices run inside you.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.693
J.c.1

29:11.208 --> 29:12.948
Morgan, please.

29:26.348 --> 29:30.341
Nick. Nick! Yo! Yo!

29:31.979 --> 29:35.471
- Stop it!
- Yo, that's Frankie man.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.974
Let me go!

29:39.111 --> 29:44.231
The voices she hears the voices.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.982
Coming from the traffic
coming from the cube.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.610
Like the cry of babies
passing through a tube.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.614
- Voices run inside you.
- Go ahead, go!

29:57.129 --> 30:01.122
Shit, man. Hey, Nick!

30:01.258 --> 30:04.625
- Get that asshole, will ya.
- What? Oh, man.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.256
Get out of my way.

30:10.267 --> 30:13.759
Get out of my way, fag!
Move, man.

30:13.770 --> 30:17.262
Move. Get out of my way.
Get out of here. Movel

30:18.775 --> 30:20.265
Nick?

30:20.777 --> 30:22.267
What is she doing? I don't know.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.898
Get off me, man!

30:31.913 --> 30:34.905
You having a nice time?

30:44.426 --> 30:46.917
You take her home!
The dance is over.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.420
Like the cry of babies
passing through a tube.

30:49.431 --> 30:53.424
The voices run inside you.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.683
Hey, wait. Hey, wait!

31:08.200 --> 31:10.691
We're gonna serve
this dude now, man.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.221
Come on!

31:40.232 --> 31:43.224
Just when I thought we were
getting to be good friends.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.726
Come on. Come on.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.733
There's something wrong with this guy.
What's wrong with you?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.737
I should just ice
your ass right now.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.614
Yeah? Yeah.

31:59.126 --> 32:01.617
Why? 'Cause I danced
with one of your boyfriends?

32:03.130 --> 32:06.122
That's some funny stuff.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.125
You owe me.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.628
Where are those keys, huh?

32:15.642 --> 32:17.633
You like that, don't ya?

32:17.644 --> 32:20.636
It's a little payment
for services rendered.

32:22.649 --> 32:27.643
Oh, yeah. If I ever
catch you near Frankie again,

32:27.654 --> 32:31.647
I'll take you out so fast you
won't even have time to spit.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.283
Look at me. Look at me, man.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.285
Remember this, maricon.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.787
You'll feel better
in the morning.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.790
Hit it, man!

33:02.814 --> 33:06.306
This is a bad car, Nick.
We should have done this a long time ago.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.810
Yo, yo, yo, man.
This is just like in that movie.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.315
Glad you could make it.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.818
God, I can't believe
they took your car.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.320
I don't own a car, man.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.327
Shit! Ah, shit, Nick.

33:27.339 --> 33:31.332
I'm telling you, man,
he's right behind us, Nick.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.335
What are we gonna say?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.838
Ah, shit, take this man.
Where am I gonna put it?

33:37.849 --> 33:40.340
Put it under the seat!

33:40.352 --> 33:43.344
That's the first place
he's gonna check, man.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.347
Nick, what are you gonna tell 'em?
Shut up.

33:55.367 --> 33:59.861
Don't smile, Frankie.
You know, you may be smart, hiller,

34:00.372 --> 34:02.863
but you're dead meat
when Nick gets out of jail.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.366
Well, Frankie, I thought you were going
with such a nice, respectable guy.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.370
Yeah? Bye.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.128
So there I was in front of
the review board.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.123
Now, mom, I am talking
about the entire review board.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.626
Shaking... shaking like
a bloody idiot.

34:57.637 --> 35:03.132
At one point, I was shaking so bad,
I was gonna rattle right off the platform.

35:03.143 --> 35:06.635
It doesn't matter. Anyway,
you still finished fourth in your class.

35:06.646 --> 35:10.138
Wait and see. In no time, you're going
to be the best lawyer in the country.

35:10.150 --> 35:14.143
Well, now, I wouldn't go that far.
Golden boy, how you doing?

35:14.654 --> 35:16.645
All right. How are you? Okay.

35:17.032 --> 35:20.399
- You in for the weekend?
- More or less.

35:20.410 --> 35:25.279
- Can I borrow your car tonight?
- Um, I don't know, Morgan.

35:25.290 --> 35:29.283
I was thinking of taking mom out
to a movie until dad gets home.

35:29.544 --> 35:32.536
Well, I won't be gone long, Brian.
I know that.

35:32.547 --> 35:36.039
And under any other circumstances,
I'd let you have that car in a shot.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.042
Forget it.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.544
Morgan.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.547
I'll take care of this.

35:43.933 --> 35:47.425
Morgan? Morgan,
will you just cool out?

35:47.437 --> 35:50.929
Give mom a break.
Just as soon as she gives me one.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.932
She already has,
and look what you've done with it.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.435
What do you mean by that, Brian?

35:56.446 --> 35:58.937
I mean you cause trouble
wherever you go.

35:58.948 --> 36:02.440
And mother and dad have spent a fortune
in trying to keep you in decent schools,

36:02.452 --> 36:04.943
and all you can do is screw up.

36:05.955 --> 36:08.446
Brian, I'm real sorry.

36:08.458 --> 36:12.952
But you know I never wanted to go to any of
those goddamn schools in the first place.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.560
How are you?

38:01.571 --> 38:05.063
Oh, man. You...

38:05.575 --> 38:08.567
How you doing? Where the hell
did you get Nick's car, man?

38:08.578 --> 38:12.070
His bro called my bro. Wanted him to
come pick it up and he wasn't home.

38:12.582 --> 38:15.073
So, here I am.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.575
Your pants are still dry.

38:20.590 --> 38:23.081
Here, let me give you a ride.

38:23.092 --> 38:25.083
I think I'd like to drive.

38:25.094 --> 38:28.086
Don't you trust
my driving expertise?

38:39.734 --> 38:41.725
Yeah, but it's always
been like that, you know.

38:41.736 --> 38:46.230
If I didn't follow my big brother
Brian's lead, I was invisible.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.732
Yeah? It was the same
with my family, you know,

38:48.743 --> 38:53.237
except my ma wouldn't let me join a gang
because Donnie got his ass kicked so bad,

38:53.248 --> 38:56.240
so she just outlawed it.

38:56.251 --> 38:59.243
Yeah. What happens
if you break tradition?

38:59.254 --> 39:01.245
I don't know.
I don't wanna find out.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.748
I think this is one
of Nick's favorites.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.892
I don't know. If you ask me,
he's either the toughest guy at Lawson,

39:23.903 --> 39:25.894
or the stupidest.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.396
No way. He went to one of those
brain factories back east,

39:28.408 --> 39:30.899
and I mean the guy's head
is totally crammed.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.528
- Yeah, with bullshit.
- What's the matter with her?

39:34.539 --> 39:38.031
She's pining 'cause
Nick's still in the cooler.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.533
You know how she gets
when she isn't getting any.

39:40.545 --> 39:45.039
Yeah, well, if you ask me she's
got the hots for you-know-who.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.540
I saw the way she was dancing
with him the other night.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.043
Body heat on contact.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.045
And I mean sizzling.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.549
Let's go, Ron.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.303
- I think the air's getting a little thick around here.
- Frankie, I'm not finished yet.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.805
Oh? You are now.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.699
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Forget it, man. She's bad news.

40:22.211 --> 40:25.703
Come on. I just wanna talk to her, man.
She belongs to Nick.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.081
Come on, Jimmy.
Lincoln freed the slaves.

40:28.593 --> 40:32.085
All I wanna do is talk to her.
All I wanna do is live.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.087
Hey, Nick's out. Come on.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.721
Get in the back, Jimmy.
Get in the back. No!

40:43.733 --> 40:46.224
I'll get in the back.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.727
You! Hello, Frankie.

40:48.738 --> 40:50.729
Thank you, god!

40:51.240 --> 40:53.731
What do you do
when opposites attract.

40:54.243 --> 40:57.110
What do you do
when opposites attract.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.239
What do you do
when opposites attract.

41:00.249 --> 41:03.741
What do you do.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.368
What can you do
when your worlds collide.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.371
Come on, Frankie. Don't be mad.

41:10.259 --> 41:13.501
Lovers seek a new sensation.

41:13.638 --> 41:16.129
You know, Frankie,
all I wanna do is talk to you.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.632
I just spent the last 20 minutes
telling you I got nothing to say to you.

41:19.644 --> 41:23.136
You got it? Now let me out!
Let her out, man.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.639
I just wanna work this out.
I just wanna talk to you, you know.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.142
Work it out, Frankie. Go for it!

41:29.153 --> 41:33.146
Go for it?
We got nothing to go for?

41:33.658 --> 41:35.649
Look, you blew it
and now you have to pay.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.151
Come on, Frankie. Come on.
You don't mean that.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.653
Yes, she does. No, she doesn't.

41:40.665 --> 41:43.156
Just stay out of...

41:45.670 --> 41:48.161
Nice smile.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.164
Thanks.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.015
But it still doesn't change nothing
between us. I don't know about that.

41:54.178 --> 41:58.171
I got a smile. I figure if I wait
long enough, I can... get lucky?

41:58.182 --> 42:00.173
Don't hold your breath, Morgan.

42:06.941 --> 42:09.432
Oh, gonna break the rules.

42:09.819 --> 42:13.186
Oh, gonna change the news.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.689
Oh, gonna take a chance
with the possibilities.

42:16.701 --> 42:19.693
Possibilities possibilities.

42:20.705 --> 42:24.698
What do you do
when opposites attract.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.825
Like it or not
it's a natural reaction.

42:26.836 --> 42:29.578
Lovers seek a new sensation.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.171
Wow, man, where are we?
Other side of the world, man.

42:32.592 --> 42:35.709
Oh, chateaubriand.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.587
Look at that one.

42:38.848 --> 42:42.841
I can't believe it.
It's outrageous. Oh, my god.

42:43.352 --> 42:46.594
Possibilities possibilities.

42:46.731 --> 42:50.223
This is amazing.
Look at the size of that one!

42:54.113 --> 42:58.106
Wow! Check out that lawn!
It's a block long of perfect green.

42:58.117 --> 43:01.075
It's a golf course, Ron.

43:01.162 --> 43:04.245
Ron, you're an inspiration.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.242
Tee-off time, huh?

43:09.754 --> 43:11.745
No, I think we're gonna eat.
Eat?

43:12.256 --> 43:15.248
What, you have a rich
uncle or something? No.

43:15.259 --> 43:17.250
It's Friday, juniors night.

43:17.762 --> 43:21.254
These places are all the same.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.381
I suppose they won't mind
if I don't wear my furs.

43:23.392 --> 43:26.884
Come on. Just straighten up your clothes.
Jimmy, do up your shirt.

43:27.396 --> 43:30.388
- I'll handle the rest.
- Am I completely hopeless?

43:30.399 --> 43:34.893
Of course not. Just don't say anything but
"fabulous" unless they put a gun to your head.

43:34.904 --> 43:36.895
Why? 'Cause you just
got in from Europe.

43:36.906 --> 43:39.898
You don't know how to
say anything else. Okay.

43:40.284 --> 43:43.276
Come on, Frankie.
Come on. Come on.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.781
Here, put that on. God.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.285
This thing is so heavy, Morgan.

43:53.798 --> 43:55.789
Here, hold this for me.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.791
I'll fix your button.

43:58.803 --> 44:01.795
That looks good.
Want some lipstick?

44:02.306 --> 44:03.796
No thanks. Oh, come on.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.798
No! All right, fine.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.800
Put these on. Do I look okay?

44:08.312 --> 44:09.802
Perfect. Come on. Let's go.

44:10.314 --> 44:13.314
Here you go. Look bored. That won't be
hard for Frankie. She's always bored.

44:14.819 --> 44:18.311
It's only good for about 20 minutes.
So eat fast. Come on.

44:26.330 --> 44:29.322
Well, shake it up baby,
now shake it up, baby.

44:29.333 --> 44:32.200
- Twist and shout.
- Twist and shout.

44:32.211 --> 44:35.203
Come on, come on come on,
baby, now come on, baby.

44:35.715 --> 44:38.707
- Let's work it on out.
- Work it on out.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.209
Work it on out work it on out

44:42.221 --> 44:43.711
Patty!

44:44.223 --> 44:46.589
Alan?

44:47.101 --> 44:50.093
Haven't seen 'em in years.
How are you anyway?

44:50.104 --> 44:52.595
Come on, Frankie. Fabulous.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.599
Young man? Young man?

44:55.610 --> 44:57.601
Young man!

44:57.612 --> 45:02.106
I need to see your, uh,
membership card, please.

45:02.116 --> 45:05.108
Oh, god, Reynolds, I'm glad it's you.
I feel such the fool.

45:05.119 --> 45:09.112
I left it down in my locker with my tennis
rags. It's still stuck with the racket.

45:09.123 --> 45:13.116
I'm sure Patty and Alan will vouch for us.
Love your suit.

45:16.631 --> 45:18.622
Tre fabulouso.

45:21.385 --> 45:24.877
Wow, this is great!
Shake it up, baby, now.

45:25.264 --> 45:29.257
Oh, god. You know what to do.

45:29.268 --> 45:32.760
Hey. Everybody's staring at me.

45:32.772 --> 45:35.764
Yes, they are. Well,
what's happening here now is, you see,

45:35.775 --> 45:38.266
the girls are wondering
where they've seen you before.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.893
The guys are wondering
why the hell they haven't.

45:41.405 --> 45:43.396
Well, shake it, shake it
shake it, baby, now

45:45.785 --> 45:48.777
Chuck wagon. Chuckie wagon.
I like that.

45:58.923 --> 46:00.914
Come on. Let's eat.

46:04.053 --> 46:08.046
I was just walking by and I just saw this
beautiful aura coming up over both of you.

46:08.057 --> 46:11.049
I just wanted to come by and share that.
That's a great shirt.

46:11.310 --> 46:14.802
Can you believe this place?
There's not a zit in the house.

46:15.314 --> 46:18.306
You kind of look like a Gary.
Can I call you Gary?

46:18.317 --> 46:21.809
You mean Frankie.
I can't believe you guys don't know her.

46:21.821 --> 46:24.813
You mix the wrong things,
this is really not gonna come together...

46:24.824 --> 46:27.816
And you're gonna wind up launching
your lunch all over the damn place.

46:27.827 --> 46:31.319
In from Europe for two weeks.
Very high concept, guys.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.821
Don't let them fool you.

46:33.833 --> 46:37.325
Of course size matters.
This is the '80s.

46:37.336 --> 46:41.329
Anyway, what I'm saying is you should
watch what you eat. You know what I mean?

46:41.340 --> 46:44.832
The cracked crab is to die for.
The dill sauce is what makes it.

46:44.844 --> 46:48.336
I'm not talking about size in bed.
We're all the same size in bed.

46:57.231 --> 47:02.225
Good evening. Does the word phrase "beautiful,
beautiful hair" mean anything to you?

47:02.737 --> 47:05.228
It's got a certain je ne sais
quoil can't quite figure out.

47:05.239 --> 47:08.731
I think it's the Sherry, but I'm not sure.
I'm dying to find out.

47:09.118 --> 47:12.110
This isn't a fashion statement.
It's a sweater.

47:12.621 --> 47:16.614
She had the most gorgeous boyfriend.
He was incredible. Stunning.

47:16.625 --> 47:19.116
But did you ever see those
little cocktail wieners?

47:19.128 --> 47:22.120
You know the ones?
The real, little tiny ones?

47:22.131 --> 47:25.123
Of course, the finger sandwiches,
you can never go wrong with them.

47:25.134 --> 47:28.626
If I'm having a small party,
25, 30 people,

47:29.138 --> 47:33.131
you get the watercress,
slice the purple onion very thin,

47:33.142 --> 47:37.135
touch of butter, cut the crust
off the bread, you got it made.

47:37.271 --> 47:39.762
We are working currently
with Barry manilow.

47:40.274 --> 47:41.764
You know him?
I know Barry very well.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.767
You figure you're gonna wrap it up
in wax paper, toss it in the fridge,

47:44.779 --> 47:47.270
you got it the next day
for brunch with bloodies.

47:47.782 --> 47:49.272
At first, I gagged.

47:49.784 --> 47:52.275
But after a while
it was really easy.

47:52.286 --> 47:55.278
But you guys swallow it, don't you?
Mm-hmm.

48:01.170 --> 48:04.788
I'd like to say in all sincerity,
this is the most fun I've ever had.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.040
You're a fantastic crowd.
I'm having a terrific...

48:07.551 --> 48:10.543
That couple over there. Bet you came
in a b.M.W. Tonight, didn't you?

48:10.930 --> 48:13.546
I came in a b.M.W. Once.

48:13.557 --> 48:17.049
Ronnie, what is this?

48:17.561 --> 48:20.052
Who cares? Just eat it.
You'll never see it again.

48:20.064 --> 48:22.555
I'm not gonna eat it.
You eat it. No, no.

48:22.566 --> 48:25.057
Jimmy, give me some... oh, no.

48:25.069 --> 48:28.061
Put some in your bag
and head towards the door.

48:28.072 --> 48:30.063
Can you sing? No.

48:30.574 --> 48:33.065
Okay, sit on the piano
and look pretty.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.568
Work it on out work it on out.

48:35.579 --> 48:38.571
You know you look so good
look so good.

48:38.582 --> 48:41.574
You really got me
going now got me going.

48:41.585 --> 48:44.577
Just like I knew that
you would knew you would.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.582
Take it home.

48:49.593 --> 48:51.879
We're gonna take a break now.
You're a fantastic audience.

48:52.221 --> 48:55.338
We'll be right back.
Thank you very much.

49:00.855 --> 49:03.847
And we're gonna entertain you
while they do.

49:12.867 --> 49:15.358
I feel the thunder.

49:16.871 --> 49:19.362
I feel the pain.

49:21.375 --> 49:24.367
I know the struggles you keep.

49:24.879 --> 49:26.369
The nights in the rain.

49:29.884 --> 49:31.875
I feel your face.

49:33.888 --> 49:36.379
I hear your eyes.

49:38.017 --> 49:41.509
I know the nights that
you cried it's Morgan.

49:41.520 --> 49:45.513
But still we survived
he's crazy.

49:46.775 --> 49:50.768
I walk the night

49:50.779 --> 49:54.271
- I walk the night.
- Well, my darling, would you care to dance?

49:54.533 --> 49:58.526
Fighting the darkness
that breaks our hearts.

49:58.537 --> 50:01.529
We hold each other tight.

50:03.042 --> 50:06.034
I walk the night.

50:07.546 --> 50:11.038
I walk the night.

50:11.050 --> 50:15.043
Fighting the darkness
that breaks our hearts.

50:15.054 --> 50:19.548
We hold each other.

50:19.558 --> 50:22.049
Tight.

50:37.701 --> 50:40.192
I feel your tears.

50:46.835 --> 50:51.829
We lick our wounds till
light rips through the night d.

50:53.968 --> 50:56.960
We walk the night.

50:57.972 --> 51:01.464
We walk the night.

51:01.850 --> 51:05.843
Fighting the darkness
that breaks our hearts.

51:05.854 --> 51:08.846
We hold each other tight.

51:10.359 --> 51:13.351
We walk the night.

51:15.239 --> 51:18.731
We walk the night.

51:20.119 --> 51:23.611
We walk the night
he's so unbelievable.

51:23.872 --> 51:27.364
We walk the night.

51:32.381 --> 51:36.249
We walk the night.

51:36.260 --> 51:39.752
We walk the night.

51:47.896 --> 51:51.889
You are not now,
nor were you ever members of this club.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.892
Well, how about that, Frankie?

51:56.280 --> 51:58.271
Come on.

52:10.294 --> 52:15.288
You know, I feel like we're a
million miles away from home.

52:15.299 --> 52:18.291
Well, it's just
the other side of the hill.

52:19.803 --> 52:21.293
Yeah.

52:24.808 --> 52:27.800
What did you mean
when you sang that song?

52:28.062 --> 52:30.053
Just what I said.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.065
It's funny.

52:42.076 --> 52:45.568
I never heard a guy
say anything like that before.

52:47.081 --> 52:49.572
Nick never needs anyone,
you know.

52:51.585 --> 52:55.578
Well, I... think he needs you.

52:59.593 --> 53:01.584
So what's the story with you?

53:01.595 --> 53:06.089
I mean, uh, were you really
rich before you moved here,

53:06.100 --> 53:09.592
or is that just another one
of Ronnie's famous rumors?

53:11.105 --> 53:13.596
Yeah.

53:14.108 --> 53:16.599
We were doing all right.

53:16.610 --> 53:19.602
Then my father
lost his business.

53:23.117 --> 53:27.611
Are you gonna go back there?
I mean, to college and stuff?

53:29.623 --> 53:33.115
No, I wasn't planning on it.

53:33.627 --> 53:37.119
What about you?
Are you gonna go for the scholastic gold?

53:37.631 --> 53:42.125
Are you kidding?
I'd be lucky if I graduate.

53:42.136 --> 53:45.628
No, I'll probably just get married.
You don't need college for that.

53:46.140 --> 53:48.631
Your parents happy about that?

53:48.642 --> 53:50.633
My dad is.

53:52.646 --> 53:55.638
My mom died of cancer last year.

54:01.155 --> 54:03.646
Sorry.

54:07.161 --> 54:09.152
So,

54:09.413 --> 54:11.404
feel like dancing?

54:11.415 --> 54:14.907
Yeah, I feel like dancing.

54:16.503 --> 54:19.495
Ladies and gentlemen,

54:19.757 --> 54:22.248
fasten your seat belts
and hold on to your Bobby socks.

54:22.760 --> 54:28.130
The club '60s is proud to present the
toughest band on the turf or in the surf.

54:28.140 --> 54:31.632
Those soul generators,
those rock innovators,

54:31.894 --> 54:33.885
Jack mack and the heart attack.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.911
Whoo!

55:00.923 --> 55:04.916
You got the kind of love
make a man lose his mind d.

55:06.929 --> 55:08.669
You got that
little something, babe.

55:09.181 --> 55:11.172
That lets me know
that you're mine.

55:11.183 --> 55:14.175
You look so good.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.677
You look so good.

55:16.688 --> 55:21.057
Yeah, you're looking good
I knew that you would.

55:23.070 --> 55:27.564
When you call my name, baby

55:27.950 --> 55:31.317
Gonna give you loving
like you ain't never seen.

55:31.578 --> 55:35.571
You look so good.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.825
Yeah, you're looking good.

55:40.337 --> 55:43.829
I knew that you would.

55:53.475 --> 55:57.468
Baby, you look good.

55:58.981 --> 56:00.972
You know you lookin' good.

56:01.358 --> 56:04.600
Lookin' good as you would.

56:04.611 --> 56:07.603
Mama, get your mojo.

56:07.614 --> 56:10.105
Papa, get your gun.

56:11.618 --> 56:14.610
Oh, baby
I wanna be your son-in-law.

56:14.621 --> 56:16.612
You looking good.

56:20.127 --> 56:22.118
You're looking good oh, baby.

56:22.629 --> 56:25.120
Knew that you would.

56:27.759 --> 56:30.250
'Cause it's all right
clap them hands.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.502
It's all right.

56:39.021 --> 56:41.512
I can't tell you
how good you look, baby.

56:41.523 --> 56:44.765
You're drivin' me crazy,
crazy crazy, crazy, crazy.

57:20.062 --> 57:22.053
Oh, baby you look so fine.

57:36.703 --> 57:39.194
Yeah!

57:42.459 --> 57:45.326
Thank you.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.331
Yeah. We're gonna slow it down
just a little bit.

57:51.343 --> 57:53.834
Cool it out. Get some
of the heat out of this room.

58:23.709 --> 58:25.700
Hey, Eddie.

58:28.213 --> 58:30.204
He's taking a long time.

58:30.465 --> 58:32.956
What do you mean you had to go?
What does that mean?

58:33.468 --> 58:34.958
Just what I said, all right?

58:35.470 --> 58:38.462
Just what you said!
Don't... don't you... don't you lie to me.

58:38.473 --> 58:42.466
I'm not lying to you. And if you
ever touch me like that again, Nick,

58:42.477 --> 58:44.517
I swear you'll wish to god
you never set eyes on me.

58:44.980 --> 58:47.471
You got it? You got it?

58:48.984 --> 58:50.474
Good.

58:52.487 --> 58:54.478
Damn it!

59:09.504 --> 59:11.495
I'm sorry.

59:12.507 --> 59:14.498
Come on. I said I'm sorry.

59:14.509 --> 59:19.003
This makes me crazy. How do you think I felt
knowing you were out with this jerk-off?

59:19.014 --> 59:21.005
Well, don't take it
out on me, all right?

59:21.016 --> 59:24.008
I know. I know.
I said I'm sorry.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.511
Come on. Come on.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.513
I really missed you.
I can't look at you. God!

59:29.524 --> 59:32.015
What do you mean
you can't look at me?

59:32.027 --> 59:34.518
Come here.

59:34.529 --> 59:36.520
Don't say that.

59:36.531 --> 59:39.523
You're not gonna
kiss me now, hmm?

59:39.534 --> 59:41.525
Frankie, come on.

59:41.536 --> 59:43.527
Nick, put me down, all right?

59:45.540 --> 59:48.532
Now what's the matter?

59:48.543 --> 59:50.534
Don't be so rough!

59:51.546 --> 59:53.537
I thought you liked it rough.

59:53.548 --> 59:55.539
Look, we don't do it...

59:55.550 --> 59:57.541
Until I say it's okay, remember?

59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.545
Now's not okay, all right?

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.050
Okay.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:11.055
What? What are you doing?
Not now.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:10.406
Hey, turn it up!

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:15.911
That's a classic tune, huh?

01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:52.072
What's up, maricon?

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:55.075
Hey.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.230
Oh. Come on.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:29.109
All right.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:35.115
Come on, maricon.
Show us you're a man.

01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:52.257
Stay down, man.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.641
All right. All right. All right.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:02.643
All right, man. All right.

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:04.645
Okay. Come on.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:10.650
Whoo.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:13.153
Nasty.

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:18.659
I don't know.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.661
I thought you were a smart guy.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:36.676
That... is for being stupid...

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:40.680
And messing around
with my property.

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.690
Let's go.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.911
Hi.

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:05.413
Hi. Oh, you have
some more of that?

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:09.418
No, that's it. Nice try.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:12.421
How's it going?
Oh, it's not bad.

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.423
Actually, California
real estate laws...

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:17.426
Are remarkably similar
to Connecticut's. Good.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.428
I don't think the test
is going to be any problem.

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:22.931
Morgan home yet?
Haven't seen him.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.433
He's probably out
with his friends.

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.437
Morgan?

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.441
Morgan!

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:36.945
I'll check on him.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.582
Good god. Are you all right?

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:50.584
Yes, I'm all right.

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:53.587
What happened?

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:56.089
Same thing that always happens.

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:58.092
I screwed up.

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.101
You wanna talk about it?

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.611
Look, Morgan. I know that this
move has been difficult for you.

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:20.113
It hasn't been easy
for any of us.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:23.116
I'd like to think that
if you're having problems,

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:25.369
you'd come and talk
to me about it.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.871
And say what, dad?
The prodigal son's in trouble again?

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:29.873
He can't cut it, rich or poor.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:33.127
Come on, dad. You know,
we've been through this. I'm not Brian.

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:35.629
I can't live my life like that.

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:39.633
All right. Knock it off! Just...
Just cut out that self-pitying crap.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:43.262
I don't want you to be Brian.
I want you to be you.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.264
All right. So you screwed up.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:48.267
So what? I expect you
to make mistakes.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.769
That's what life's all about,
for god's sakes.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:54.398
How else are you gonna learn who
you are and what you believe in?

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.527
What do I do right now?

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:04.032
Right now you do
what you really wanna do.

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:06.285
Do whatever it is you...

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.537
That you know is right,
that you believe in.

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:10.538
That's all.
And feel good about it.

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.920
Look, son.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:21.925
Life isn't a problem to be solved.
It's a mystery to be lived.

01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:25.679
So live it.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:28.682
You're a good man.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:30.684
You are, you know.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:35.188
Give yourself a break.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.191
Take it easy on yourself.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:44.698
We're gonna eat in about a half
hour if you wanna come down.

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:53.707
Where's Morgan? He's lying down.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.709
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.837
Nothing he can't handle.
What's for dinner?

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.839
New england clam chowder.

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.831
Fabulous, fabulous. And you?

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:37.334
Oh, wonderful, darling.

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:39.586
No, really, I'd love to make it
for some lobster tonight,

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:43.840
but we've been having so much of it at home
that I'm afraid it's coming out of our ears.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:45.842
What's a girl to do?

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:50.347
Looks like I died.

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:27.009
Definitely not.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.894
Frankie? Nick's on his way over.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:39.895
Thanks.

01:08:57.925 --> 01:09:00.917
No, probably
never get laid anyway.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.421
Oh, no!

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:08.925
Morgan!

01:09:08.935 --> 01:09:11.426
Hello, Frankie.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:15.430
Turn it off! Turn it off?
You can't just turn this off.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.434
Listen to it.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:20.562
You might just like it.
Please turn it off.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:26.192
Frankie, I thought
you wanted more.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:28.194
This isn't exactly
what I had it mind.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.578
Morgan, what are you doing?

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.331
Morgan.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.335
What are you doing?

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:47.337
Climbing up the stairs.
Please don't.

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.466
Why not?

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:53.469
After the locker room today...
Oh, my god.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:55.972
Wounds of love, Frankie.

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.975
Gimme a break. I am.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:02.354
Morgan, I'm serious.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:05.357
Frankie, what's so
unreasonable about knowing me?

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:07.859
Nothing.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.361
And everything. Morgan,
look, you gotta go, okay?

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.864
Well, I don't wanna go
till you explain to me.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.868
What's there to explain?

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.373
I'm here and you're there.
We don't fit.

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:26.753
You know, all I'm asking for
is a shot, Frankie.

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:30.007
It's not going to
change anything.

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:33.509
It could.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:42.769
It could. A chance
is worth everything.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.772
Frankie, get out here!
Now do you see why you have to go?

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.774
Frankie! I'm coming!

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.776
Come to my house for dinner
tomorrow night. No way!

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.778
Hey, Frankie! Forget it.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.780
Want me to get that? All right.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.782
Come on! I'm coming.
I'll be there.

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:58.785
It's for you. Read it, really.
Read it. Now go, Morgan!

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:00.787
Go! Get out of here!

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:03.289
I'm coming! God. Come on!

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.792
What are you doing in here?
Nothing!

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:08.294
Can't a girl have
any privacy around here?

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:12.299
Yeah, but not when
we wanna celebrate.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.301
Celebrate? That's right.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:17.429
It's not every night I get asked for
my baby's hand. You gonna open that?

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.681
What? Yep.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:22.183
Can you believe this?

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:26.688
And he said yes.
I'm so happy, sweetheart.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.690
How do you open this stuff?

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:32.694
I only wish mama were here
to celebrate with us.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:42.329
There we go.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.794
Morgan! Morgan! Wait up!

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.297
Hey, Jimmy!

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.800
Isn't it great?
You did all the work yourself?

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.802
Yeah, just about.
It's tremendous!

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.304
Yeah. It's got your name on it.
It's really great.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.306
It's yours.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:04.309
Consolation prize. Consolation?

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:06.436
Consolation for what?

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:10.941
I love this guy!
Good attitude, man.

01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:13.443
Hell, they're not going to get married
till after graduation anyway, right?

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:15.820
- Check it out.
- What are you talking about?

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:19.450
Nick's marrying Frankie.
Isn't that what we're talking about?

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:22.202
I can't believe it.

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:27.206
Where are you going? Morgan!

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:29.459
Hey, you on the bike, hey!

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.461
Go get him, copper!

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.966
So, are you gonna get a ring?

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:39.469
If you do,
get it at woolworth's.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.472
Susie ristelli got hers there.
It almost looks like the real thing.

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:44.520
I saw it. It really does.
It's amazing.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:47.978
I wanna get one.
Frankie, I just heard...

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:49.980
I wanna talk to you.

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.484
He's crazy.

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:58.488
Wow. Total romance.

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:04.619
I thought you were coming
for dinner tonight. I am!

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.621
Frankie.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:10.124
When, Frankie?
After the wedding?

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:14.629
Come on. You don't have
to be a piece of his turf.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:19.134
Look. I'm not his. I can make my
own choices, Morgan. I'll be there.

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:24.514
Go easy on him tonight, page.
This means a lot to him.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:27.017
Mm-hmm.

01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:30.020
So did that girl he brought home
for easter last year, remember?

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:34.024
She was so stoned, all she could do was look
at the peas and say, "wow, they're so green."

01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:36.526
She was kinda cute.

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:39.028
No, really, this is different.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.531
He's really trying.

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:45.535
So am 1.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:47.912
I'll get it.

01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:58.298
C-come on in. Come on in.

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:07.307
Oh, I, uh,

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:09.809
I brought your book.
How'd you like it?

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.813
It was good. A little crazy.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.816
I never met anybody
that felt things that way.

01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:18.818
Yeah.

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:25.324
Well, are we gonna
stand here all night?

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.201
Thank you.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.707
Oh, thank you.

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:22.507
You know, I think you would have really enjoyed
spending time with us in Connecticut, Frankie.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.509
There was always so much to do.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.513
Our house was right on the sound.
Skiing, boating.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:31.015
Morgan was quite a good
yachtsman in his own way.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.018
You were.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.909
Don't you think he was
better than Brian, David?

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:38.273
Mm.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.275
I think so.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.777
If only he would put
a little heart into it.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.532
Of course, none of that
matters very much now.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.535
I mean, since we've moved.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:04.674
What a pretty picture.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.309
What's with Frankie, man?
Get outta here.

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:17.687
What?
Get outta here, I said, Eddie.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.191
Get outta here.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:32.577
You lived in the Los Angeles area
all your life, Frankie? Yeah.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:37.082
I mean, uh, yes, sir,
my whole life.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:40.711
Well, then you must have been to
the huntington gardens. Have you?

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:43.463
Oh, I hear the roses
are absolutely fabulous.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:50.469
I don't think that Frankie goes
for things like that very much.

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:56.475
She spends most of
her spare time reading.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:17:01.106
Oh, well, since you've
never been there either,

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.608
maybe we should go together
one of these days.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.110
We'll bring your mother along.
We'll make a day of it.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:09.614
I mean, if she likes roses.
Does she?

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:14.994
Oh, don't worry about that.
It's all right. These things happen.

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:18.498
You'd better get into the kitchen, put
some cold water on that before it stains.

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:20.500
It's all right.

01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:23.002
Her mother's dead.

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.506
I didn't know that.

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:29.008
How was I supposed to know that?

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:31.510
Let me see. It's ruined.

01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:34.514
Here, let me... look. Why don't you
just go talk about roses or something?

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:37.517
Frankie, she didn't mean
anything by it.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:39.519
Right, Morgan.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:43.022
Frankie.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:47.026
Morgan, I'm sorry.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.531
Frankie! Frankie!

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:54.534
Excuse Mel

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:57.537
I promised Ronnie I'd meet her at
woolworth's to look at wedding rings.

01:17:57.548 --> 01:17:59.539
You know, Frankie,
you don't belong to Nick.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:03.543
Well, maybe not,
but I don't belong to you either.

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.114
Can we take him out now?

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.619
No, he's later.

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:41.622
I gotta go see
my girlfriend now.

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.258
Hi, baby.

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:56.262
Where you going?

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:58.264
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.270
Frankie?

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:09.275
You're missing your mama
again, aren't you?

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.781
Come here. Come here.

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:21.287
Why don't you come with us?

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:25.291
Come on. Come on.

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.434
Teddy sniffing glue
he was 12 years old.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.936
Fell from the roof
on east two-nine

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.939
Kathy was 11
when she pulled the plug

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.941
I'm sorry, Nick.
I'm just so... check that out.

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:52.944
I know. No, come on.
Come on. Gimme a kiss.

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:55.947
Just kiss me. A good one.

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:01.452
Yo, man, gimme that bottle.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.954
Come on. Here.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.957
It won't go on, man.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:08.459
That'll clear things up, right?

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:15.967
Better? Yeah.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:18.469
Yeah? Yeah.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.971
So.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:24.475
So, what do you think?

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:27.978
You guys feel like, uh,
kicking up a little dust or what?

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.981
Yeah, man. It's about time.

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:31.857
I'm serious. Jesus Christ.

01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.860
Yo, let's hit feather's pad.
Yeah.

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:39.115
Some bitchin' proof and herbie said
Tony, can you fly.

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:42.117
But Tony couldn't fly Tony died.

01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:45.121
Those are people who died, died.

01:20:45.132 --> 01:20:47.123
Those are people who died, died.

01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:50.125
Those are people who died, died.

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:53.129
Those are people who died, died.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.631
They were all my friends
and they just died

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.635
Mary took a dry dive
from a hotel room

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:02.388
Bobby hung himself
from his cell in the tombs

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:05.391
Judy jumped in front
of a subway train

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:07.393
Eddie got slit
in the jugular vein.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:10.271
And, Eddie, I miss you
more than all the others.

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:12.899
And I salute you, brother.

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:15.401
Those are people who died, died.

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:17.903
Those are people who died, died.

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:20.907
Those are people who died, died.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:23.034
Those are people who died, died.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:26.037
They were all my friends
and they just died.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:34.545
Yo, Nick. How much longer are
we gonna be doing this, man?

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.547
We've been driving around
for hours, bro.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:40.551
That's right, and we're gonna keep on driving
until I find what we're looking for.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:43.554
I hope you find it soon, man,
'cause I'm about to pee in my pants.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:47.558
So, shoot it out the window, man.
Christ, just use your head.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:51.062
Not a bad idea.
Hold onto this, bro.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.064
Chill out. All right, move.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:55.066
This guy needs a lifestyle. Yo!

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:58.069
Good news, America.
Coming through.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.071
Hey, it's chilly out here.

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:04.576
Died, died those are
people who died, died.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:07.453
Those are people who died, died.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:09.955
Those are people who died, died.

01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:13.334
They were all my friends,
and they just died.

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:31.727
Oh, shit! I can't believe this.
We're running out of gas.

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:35.230
What? I said,
we're running out of gas.

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:37.232
Here, uh,

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.735
why don't you take this watch
and go ask that cabdriver...

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:41.737
If he'll trade it in
for a little change?

01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:54.876
I gave you this watch, Nick.
Don't you have any money?

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.878
If I did, I wouldn't
ask you to trade it.

01:22:56.889 --> 01:22:58.880
Come on.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:24.905
Uh, I can't do it, Nick.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.909
I mean, I'd rather walk than
trade in this watch, you know?

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.911
I mean, I gave it to you,
you know?

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:32.914
That's nice.
But why can't you do it, really?

01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:37.419
Why? 'Cause that's
hiller's father, huh?

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:40.421
Is that why? Is that why?

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.423
Come on. Come on.
I asked you a question.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.425
Come on! Yes.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:47.428
Well, maybe you should have thought of all
that before you became involved in this.

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.930
Now go out there. No.

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:51.933
Frankie, I said go out there.
No.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:54.435
I said go out there.
Now get out there!

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.443
You've got to get out of here.
Please listen to me. You gotta go!

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:04.945
Calm down. I don't think you understand.
You gotta go!

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.627
Nick, let's go. Nick, let's go.

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:04.505
Nick, come on. Let's go, man!

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:08.509
Frankie. It'll be okay, Nick.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.511
Come on!

01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:49.425
Dad?

01:25:49.936 --> 01:25:52.052
Dad?

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:55.056
Don't worry. He's very strong.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:16.202
Mom?

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:26.211
Mom?

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:28.214
Brian.

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:13.008
I'm so sorry.

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:15.510
It's all right.
The doctor says he'll be all right.

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:42.121
Ow, sorry.

01:27:42.132 --> 01:27:45.124
It's a bad one.

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:48.627
Yeah, I know.
I can feel it clear into next week.

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:50.629
Want me to stop?

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:53.632
No. No. Sorry.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:03.142
I just keep hearing that...

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:05.144
That gun go off
over and over again.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:08.021
It hurts so bad.

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:12.526
How do you deal with it?

01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:17.031
I don't know. I don't.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:22.035
No, I just...

01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:24.038
Keep exploding.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:30.544
Wreaking havoc
on everyone's lives.

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:38.177
I, uh,

01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:41.680
thought things were supposed
to be easy when you had money.

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:45.184
Yeah, if you don't
take it seriously.

01:28:48.698 --> 01:28:50.689
How do you do that?

01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:56.195
By letting it go.

01:28:58.208 --> 01:29:00.699
I don't think you can
hold on to anything...

01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:02.701
Until you let it go.

01:31:06.002 --> 01:31:07.993
Sure, honey, I understand.

01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:10.495
Of course, I just
want you to be happy.

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:12.998
It's just that I thought that
you and Nick... Nick what?

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:16.752
Nick what? You bitch! You bitch!

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:19.880
I saw you! I saw you!

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:22.383
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Get off of me!

01:31:26.272 --> 01:31:29.764
You don't own me, you bastard!

01:31:30.026 --> 01:31:33.018
You don't own me!
You don't own me!

01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:36.521
Let me go! Put me down!

01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:41.527
How can you do this?

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:46.531
How can you do this?

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:48.659
You don't even care!

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.166
Nick, no, please!

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:58.168
Call your boyfriend. Come on.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:02.172
Nick, please, don't! Call him!
I want you to call him.

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:05.550
Call him. I said call him!

01:32:15.572 --> 01:32:17.563
Hello.

01:32:17.574 --> 01:32:19.565
Morgan, stay away from him.
He'll kill you.

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:21.441
I swear to god he'll
kill you, Morgan.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:24.444
Hey, bebop, you listen to me.

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:26.447
Nobody takes anything
that I own. Nobody!

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:30.951
I'll kill her first, man.
You got that?

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:34.704
You be at the warehouse
in 20 minutes.

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.706
You got that?

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.708
Hel...

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:43.713
Morgan?

01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:46.717
I wanna talk to you.

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:50.220
How's dad? He's a little bit better.
He asked about you.

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:54.725
Now, are you gonna tell me what kind of
trouble you're in before the police get here?

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:56.727
Hmm?

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:58.729
It's nothing I can't handle.

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:05.235
I am just trying... Morgan,
don't walk away from me!

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:07.237
What do you want, Brian, huh?

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.239
Why don't you tell me
what a waste my life is, huh?

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:12.742
Or give me a lecture
on the rules of the game.

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:16.246
Well, I hate to tell you, big brother,
but the rules have changed a little.

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:18.748
You leave this house,
I'll have you picked up within 24 hours.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.752
Great. I can use all the
help I can get tonight.

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:25.756
Get the hell
out of my way, Brian.

01:33:52.919 --> 01:33:54.409
Chico, se pase.

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:56.912
Is Jimmy here? Is Jimmy here?
Over here. No.

01:33:56.923 --> 01:33:58.914
- Do you know where he is?
- Yeah.

01:33:58.925 --> 01:34:01.416
Probably out with Ronnie
getting his chain pulled.

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:08.298
If you see him, give him this.

01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:11.677
Donnie, all right? Yeah, yeah.
What is this, your will?

01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:57.973
Ah!

01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:05.981
Hey, Nick.
This is bullshit, man.

01:35:06.492 --> 01:35:08.153
How much longer
are we gonna have to wait?

01:35:08.494 --> 01:35:10.485
Shut up, asshole!

01:35:10.496 --> 01:35:12.987
I swear to god I'll kill you
if you mess this up, Mickey.

01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:14.990
No one says a word.
You got that?

01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:16.992
Bernie, go back to where
I told you, all right?

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:33.633
Hey.

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:35.635
Come here.

01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:38.138
Come on, little puppy dog.

01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:42.142
Come on, puppy. Sit.

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:44.519
Sit.

01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:47.522
Sit down.

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:52.903
Oh, that's a good girl.

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.934
I don't even know who you are.

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:26.937
Like, I can't even
look at your face.

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:51.355
Get that faggot!

01:38:11.511 --> 01:38:14.253
Come on!

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:20.319
You crazy?

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.351
Nick!

01:40:02.246 --> 01:40:04.737
Shit!

01:40:13.508 --> 01:40:15.999
Shit, dog, come on!

01:40:29.357 --> 01:40:31.348
Let him go.

01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:38.355
Move back, Nick.
Move back, I said!

01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:40.357
I said move back!

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.868
Okay. You're right.

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.870
You're right. I...

01:40:56.384 --> 01:41:00.377
Look, look, look. It's over.

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.880
It was all for you.

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:07.884
You didn't do it for me.
It's your whole life!

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:10.386
How many bullets
are left, huh, Nick?

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:13.390
Enough for Morgan?

01:41:13.401 --> 01:41:15.392
My father? Frankie, come on.

01:41:15.403 --> 01:41:18.895
For anyone who isn't part of your turf?
Come on.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.897
How many, huh?

01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:47.299
Excuse me? Huh?

01:42:25.097 --> 01:42:26.587
Come on. Let's go.

01:44:34.602 --> 01:44:37.093
Morgan, watch out!

01:45:10.888 --> 01:45:13.379
J.b., is that who
I think that is?

01:45:13.891 --> 01:45:16.382
Is that that same woman
I saw the other night, man?

01:45:16.393 --> 01:45:19.385
Everybody's got a treat.

01:45:19.522 --> 01:45:22.514
Move the tables.
I think I need an ambulance!

01:45:22.525 --> 01:45:26.017
'Cause this girl is fine!

01:45:26.529 --> 01:45:28.895
I'm gonna tell you,
something baby. Whew!

01:45:28.906 --> 01:45:33.900
You're the reason all the boy
come back for more.

01:45:40.042 --> 01:45:42.033
See this?
The band starts cookin' d.

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:45.161
When they see you lookin'
so fine.

01:45:45.548 --> 01:45:47.038
Whoo!

01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:51.042
I say I never seen a red dress
contest in my time.

01:45:51.554 --> 01:45:53.545
Yeah, I tell you what.

01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:56.047
You're more than a beauty queen.

01:45:56.058 --> 01:45:59.050
You're the best-looking thing
that I've ever seen.

01:45:59.311 --> 01:46:02.303

T-u-f-f you're so tuff.

01:46:09.446 --> 01:46:10.936
Sure enough whoo!

01:46:17.329 --> 01:46:21.322
Lines around the block don't
make no difference to me.

01:46:22.459 --> 01:46:23.949
Know what I mean? See.

01:46:24.461 --> 01:46:28.955
I can't wait forever
to get one dance whoo!

01:46:28.966 --> 01:46:33.460
But while my heart's beating backbeat,
my soul is singing sweet romance.

01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:35.961
State-of-the-arts.

01:46:36.098 --> 01:46:38.589
You're more than
a dream come true.

01:46:38.601 --> 01:46:41.593
My wildest fantasy
can't hold a candle to you.

01:46:42.104 --> 01:46:45.596

01:46:45.608 --> 01:46:48.600

You're so tuff now

01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:09.621
I don't mean it rough when I say.

01:47:26.774 --> 01:47:29.265
Whoo!

01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:32.268
I swear when
she walked in the room...

01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:35.772
I could not believe my eyes.

01:47:35.783 --> 01:47:38.775
Do me a favor,
would you, please?

01:47:39.161 --> 01:47:42.153
What'd I miss?
Oh, my god. She's calling me.

01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:44.655
Go down there and tell her
I wanna talk to her.

01:47:44.667 --> 01:47:48.159
