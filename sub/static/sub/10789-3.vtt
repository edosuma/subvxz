WEBVTT

00:45.917 --> 00:48.375
OH, MY GOD!

00:48.375 --> 00:51.583
YOU'RE STILL THERE,
LIKE A VEGETABLE.

00:51.583 --> 00:53.667
WRITING A GOOD E-MAIL
IS HARD.

00:53.667 --> 00:56.250
YES, ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT IS A HUGE MISTAKE.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.208
SHUT UP.

00:57.208 --> 00:58.667
JOEY, I AM SERIOUS.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.834
E-MAIL EXPRESSION
IS THE SCOURGE
OF THE MODERN AGE.

01:00.834 --> 01:03.542
THE INTERNET HAS MADE IT
WAY TOO EASY TO EXPRESS ONESELF.

01:03.542 --> 01:05.750
OK, YOU HAVE
SOME FLEETING THOUGHT.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.083
YOU SEND IT.
IT LANDS WITH A THUD

01:07.083 --> 01:08.792
IN SOME UNSUSPECTING
PERSON'S MAILBOX.

01:08.792 --> 01:13.458
SAID PERSON THEN READS IT,
GETS IRKED BECAUSE YOU'VE
RECAPPED A CONVERSATION

01:13.458 --> 01:14.500
THAT YOU PRESUMABLY
ALREADY HAD.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.542
THEY FAIL TO RESPOND.
YOU FEEL SLIGHTED.

01:17.542 --> 01:20.959
BUT IF YOU MUST BE ONE

01:20.959 --> 01:24.834
OF THESE PATHETIC
PASSIVE/AGGRESSIVE
E-MAIL TYPES,

01:24.834 --> 01:25.375
FAR BE IT FROM ME
TO STOP YOU.

01:27.959 --> 01:30.917
WHAT DO YOU HAVE SO FAR?

01:30.917 --> 01:34.625
WELL...
I HAD "DEAR DAWSON,"
AND THEN I ERASED IT.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.625
WHY? I THINK
THAT'S A NICE START.

01:36.625 --> 01:38.291
I SEEMED COLD.
TRUE.

01:38.291 --> 01:40.500
I MEAN, YOU DID
JUST NUDE-UP WITH THE GUY.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.083
OH, I'M SORRY, OR DID YOU GUYS
DO IT THROUGH A HOLE IN A SHEET

01:43.083 --> 01:44.291
BECAUSE THAT'S VERY DAWSON.

01:44.291 --> 01:45.667
AGAIN, SHUT UP.

01:45.667 --> 01:48.667
SORRY. OK, SO WHAT
DO YOU WANT TO SAY?

01:48.667 --> 01:49.917
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,

01:49.917 --> 01:52.000
I DON'T LIKE
THE WAY THINGS ENDED,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.417
AND I WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT I CARE,

01:55.417 --> 01:58.875
BUT I ALSO
WANT TO HOLD ON TO MY
RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION.

01:58.875 --> 02:01.500
OBVIOUSLY. WELL,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CALL HIM?

02:01.500 --> 02:05.625
I'M AFRAID WE'LL JUST
FALL RIGHT BACK INTO
OUR OLD PATTERNS.

02:05.625 --> 02:09.708
TRUST ME. E-MAIL IS
A FAR SAFER ALTERNATIVE
AT THE MOMENT.

02:09.708 --> 02:13.125
OK, IF YOU MUST DO THIS,
THEN I SAY THAT YOU GO FOR IT.

02:13.125 --> 02:16.083
YOU KNOW, BE GOOEY
AND BE EMBARRASSING,

02:16.083 --> 02:19.250
BUT MOST OF ALL,
JUST BE REAL, JOEY.

02:19.250 --> 02:22.750
SAY ALL OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU CAN'T SAY
TO HIS FACE, THE WHOLE NINE.

02:22.750 --> 02:26.375
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I BETTER GET TO WORK.

02:26.375 --> 02:30.458
BUT...THANK YOU, AUDREY.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.667
NO PROBLEM, SISTER CHRISTIAN.

04:48.583 --> 04:48.917
THAT'S GROSS.

04:48.917 --> 04:51.166
THAT'S GROSS.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.125
YEAH.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.792
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE MORE--

04:53.792 --> 04:55.750
SENSITIVE? WELL-GROOMED?

04:55.750 --> 04:57.792
UP BY 6:00
DRINKING A ZONE SHAKE?

04:57.792 --> 04:58.959
TO BEGIN WITH.

04:58.959 --> 04:59.792
AND I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE LITTLE MORE--

04:59.792 --> 05:01.959
SNAGGLETOOTHED?
SUCKING DOWN THE TEA?

05:01.959 --> 05:02.917
CHOKING ON BANGERS
AND MASH?

05:02.917 --> 05:04.208
(CHUCKLES) YEAH.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.125
WELL, IT'S A SERVICE
WE PROVIDE

05:06.125 --> 05:07.291
TO THOSE LESS EDUCATED
OF OUR CULTURES--

05:07.291 --> 05:11.166
YOU AND I...
WE KEEP THEM GUESSING.

05:11.166 --> 05:14.125
(SNICKERING)

05:14.125 --> 05:17.750
OK, OK. YUCK IT UP, KIDDIES,

05:17.750 --> 05:19.667
'CAUSE THIS IS HOW
I WILL APPEAR EVERY MORNING

05:19.667 --> 05:21.125
IN ALL MY FORMAL GLORY.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.250
SOME OF US ACTUALLY
HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING.

05:22.250 --> 05:25.125
OH, POOR PACEY WITTER HAS
A JOB THAT MILLION WOULD WANT

05:25.125 --> 05:26.708
THAT HE'S VASTLY
UNDERQUALIFIED FOR.

05:26.708 --> 05:27.375
OH, COME ON.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.417
WHAT'S UP
WITH THAT HAIR, MAN?

05:29.417 --> 05:30.875
WHY IS IT...
THE WAY IT IS?

05:30.875 --> 05:33.583
IT'S TOO MUCH PRODUCT?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.959
NOW, ARE YOU SURE
THAT BLONDE OF YOURS
ISN'T A RUSE, PACEY?

05:35.959 --> 05:37.583
EMMA, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU CAN'T DEAL
WITH THE MAN LOVE,

05:37.583 --> 05:39.834
(SLAP)
I DON'T THINK
THIS THING'S
GONNA WORK OUT.

05:39.834 --> 05:40.834
DON'T REMIND ME.

05:40.834 --> 05:43.959
AND I KNOW YOU'VE
GOT THIS BRILLIANT JOB
AND ALL,

05:43.959 --> 05:47.250
BUT YOU'RE STILL GOING
TO HAVE TO PUT THE DISHES
IN THE WASH BEFORE YOU GO.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.333
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY
I CAME DOWN HERE.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.125
AND YOU, JACK,

05:50.125 --> 05:52.583
LEFT THE DOOR UNLOCKED
LAST NIGHT

05:52.583 --> 05:55.417
AFTER THE HARD SELL
YOU TWO BOYS GAVE ME
ABOUT FREE SECURITY.

05:55.417 --> 05:56.750
THAT WASN'T ME.
THAT WAS HIM.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.291
I'M TOTALLY
NONCONFRONTATIONAL.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.333
ALL RIGHT, OK.
ALL RIGHT, DULY NOTED.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.208
MAN, BETWEEN THE SUIT
AND NAGGING

06:04.208 --> 06:06.959
IT'S LIKE A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED AMERICAN
FAMILY AROUND HERE.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.834
AUDREY!

06:49.834 --> 06:50.875
WHAT?

06:50.875 --> 06:52.542
AUDREY, WAKE UP.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.583
WHAT?
THE E-MAIL.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

06:53.583 --> 06:57.166
I SENT IT TO EVERYONE,
NOT LIKE "THE GANG"
EVERYONE--

06:57.166 --> 06:59.166
COUNTLESS STRANGERS,
"CAMPUS WIDE" EVERYONE.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.041
WELL, HONEY,
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

07:01.041 --> 07:03.291
IT WAS A MISTAKE.
I WAS TIRED.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.208
I CLICKED
ON THE WRONG ADDRESS.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.417
SEE? I TOLD YOU
THAT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA.

07:07.417 --> 07:08.875
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?

07:08.875 --> 07:12.583
I DON'T KNOW.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.625
SUCKS TO BE YOU?

07:18.583 --> 07:20.917
(HUMMING)

07:24.083 --> 07:25.583
WITTER!

07:25.583 --> 07:26.583
RINALDI.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.083
THAT'S "SIR"
UNTIL YOU BUY ME
FLOWERS, WITTER.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.250
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.000
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I WAS JUST UNDER
THE IMPRESSION

07:32.000 --> 07:33.250
THAT I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE UNTIL 9:00.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.208
AHH, "SUPPOSED TO."
WELL, THAT'S CUTE.

07:35.208 --> 07:36.750
ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO DRESS YOURSELF,

07:36.750 --> 07:39.250
OR DOES YOUR MOMMY
ACTUALLY WANT YOU
TO LOOK LIKE A PANSY?

07:39.250 --> 07:40.959
LOOK AROUND.
YOU SEE THESE GUYS?

07:40.959 --> 07:44.083
APPARENTLY,
THESE GENTLEMEN
ARE FREE THINKERS.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.125
SINCE YOU'VE YET
TO GROW A PAIR,

07:46.125 --> 07:47.625
YOU GET STUCK
WITH THESE.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.875
AND WHAT'S ALL THIS?

07:49.875 --> 07:53.125
THAT IS A COLLECTION
OF ABOUT 30 COLD DAYS
IN HELL:

07:53.125 --> 07:55.417
RICH GUYS SITTIN' ON
PILES OF MONEY SO HIGH

07:55.417 --> 07:56.500
THAT
THEIR DAUGHTERS ELOPED

07:56.500 --> 07:58.083
AND SOLD
THEIR OWN BABIES
ON THE BLACK MARKET

07:58.083 --> 07:59.750
JUST TO PUT RAMEN
ON THE TABLE.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.041
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN
ABLE TO SELL THEM STOCK,

08:01.041 --> 08:04.875
AND THEY WILL CERTAINLY
NEVER BUY IT FROM
THE TARDY LIKES OF YOU.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.291
YOU BETTER
GET ON THE PHONE.

08:06.291 --> 08:07.750
WE WORK
ON COMMISSION HERE.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.458
AND THE GUYS
ON YOUR LIST DON'T KNOW
HOW DREAMY YOU ARE,

08:10.458 --> 08:14.125
SO I WOULD WORK
THAT BLUE COLLAR CHARM
FULL-THROTTLE.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.000
STOP BATTIN'
YOUR EYES AT ME.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.625
IS THIS SOME SORT
OF PUNISHMENT?

08:19.625 --> 08:21.166
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO
GET YOU TO LEAVE.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.125
I DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH DESKS.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.667
(CHUCKLES)

08:35.833 --> 08:37.582
NO, JEN. JEN, CAN I
SIT ON THE INSIDE?

08:37.582 --> 08:39.625
I WANT TO SIT
ON THE INSIDE. SORRY.

08:39.625 --> 08:42.291
WHAT? AHH...

08:42.291 --> 08:43.125
SORRY.

08:43.125 --> 08:44.542
ARE WE DONE PLAYING
MUSICAL CHAIRS YET?

08:44.542 --> 08:46.959
I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE
TO SEE THE BOARD.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.333
DON'T INSULT ME WITH
YOUR SCHOLARLY GUISE.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.000
YOU JUST WANT TO
GET A GOOD LOOK
AT FREEMAN.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
AND WHY NOT?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.333
MOTHER, MAY I?

08:54.333 --> 08:57.333
AUDREY, NOT
THAT WE DON'T ENJOY
HAVING YOU HERE,

08:57.333 --> 08:58.333
BECAUSE WE DO,

08:58.333 --> 09:00.000
BUT DON'T YOU
HAVE YOUR OWN CLASSES
TO GO TO?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.208
WORTHINGTON'S CHARMS
ARE LOST ON ME.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.166
MISS ONE MORE WEEK,
AND MAYBE THEY'LL JUST
KICK YOU OUT.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.208
AWESOME.

09:05.208 --> 09:07.000
GUYS, SHH!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.834
OK, I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU.

09:08.834 --> 09:13.458
THIS IS STUDIOUS JACK,
NOT TO BE CONFUSED
WITH FUN-TIME JACK.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.041
HE DOESN'T
LIKE TO MISS A WORD
OF FREEMAN'S LECTURE,

09:15.041 --> 09:15.542
SO YOU SHOULD JUST TRY
TO KEEP IT DOWN.

09:15.542 --> 09:16.667
SO TELL ME SOMETHING.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.667
BETWEEN HIM AND GRAMS,
HOW DO NAP DURING CLASS?

09:18.667 --> 09:21.000
Freeman: OK, EVERYONE...
Jack: SHH! SHH!

09:21.000 --> 09:21.500
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.291
BEFORE WE GET STARTED,

09:23.291 --> 09:24.750
I JUST WANTED TO
INFORM THOSE AMONG YOU

09:24.750 --> 09:26.792
WHO ARE TRULY ENAMORED
WITH OUR TWISTED CULTURE.

09:26.792 --> 09:30.625
THAT THERE'S A LITTLE
EXTRA CREDIT ASSIGNMENT TODAY.

09:30.625 --> 09:34.000
NOW, MY HEART WON'T BE BROKEN
IF NOBODY SHOWS UP.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.875
I WILL, HOWEVER,
SILENTLY JUDGE YOU

09:35.875 --> 09:37.041
FOR THE REST
OF THE SEMESTER.

09:37.041 --> 09:40.625
THERE'S A THEATER DOWNTOWN
THAT'S SHOWIN'
A DOUBLE-FEATURE

09:40.625 --> 09:43.333
WHICH EXEMPLIFIES
OUR CULTURE'S OBSESSION

09:43.333 --> 09:45.083
WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL
WHO PLAYS UGLY.

09:45.083 --> 09:48.000
THE PLAIN JANES WHO GO ON
TO GRACE THE COVERS OF COSMO

09:48.000 --> 09:50.166
THE SAME MONTH THEIR
MAKEOVER MOVIES COME OUT.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.250
OH, NO. SCHOLARLY JACK
IS GONNA

09:52.250 --> 09:54.041
MAKE ME WATCH
MISS CONGENIALITY
AGAIN.

09:54.041 --> 09:55.208
I LOVE THAT MOVIE.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.083
EH-HEH!

09:56.083 --> 09:58.708
Freeman: SO, SEE ME
AFTER CLASS FOR DETAILS.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.708
Heston: OK, KIDDIES,
KNOCK BACK YOUR RITALIN
AND SETTLE DOWN.

10:08.125 --> 10:11.458
YOU MAY RECALL,
WE WERE WRAPPING UP
A RATHER DEPRAVED DISCUSSION

10:11.458 --> 10:12.250
OF PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT
LAST WEEK.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.750
SADLY, WE WON'T BE DABBLING

10:14.750 --> 10:18.625
IN ROTH'S
STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS
SEXUAL RIVERS MUCH LONGER,

10:18.625 --> 10:24.208
BUT FATE ASSIGNED US
SOME ADDITIONAL READING
LAST NIGHT VIA E-MAIL.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.166
I THINK YOU ALL GOT A COPY,
SO WHY NOT?

10:27.166 --> 10:29.083
LET'S DISCUSS SOMETHING YOU
ACTUALLY MIGHT'VE READ.

10:29.083 --> 10:32.208
"DEAR DAWSON,

10:32.208 --> 10:34.333
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN."

10:34.333 --> 10:35.750
UH, PROFESSOR HETSON--

10:35.750 --> 10:36.792
NOBODY LIKES A SHOW-OFF,
POTTER.

10:36.792 --> 10:40.500
YOU DON'T REACH A POINT
FOR SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS,

10:40.500 --> 10:42.166
SO I'LL SKIP AHEAD.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.375
"IN THE MOMENT
WHEN WE TOUCHED,

10:43.375 --> 10:45.959
"MAYBE WE WENT
SOMEWHERE ELSE

10:45.959 --> 10:49.542
"THAT ROSE ABOVE ALL THIS,
BUT THEN WE LANDED,

10:49.542 --> 10:51.000
AND I THINK
MAYBE WE CRASHED."

10:51.000 --> 10:53.208
(LAUGHTER)

10:53.208 --> 10:55.708
WHY, WHEN BROACHING
THE TOPIC OF SEX,

10:55.708 --> 10:58.083
DO SO MANY WRITERS TRY TO
WRITE THEMSELVES OUT OF IT?

10:58.083 --> 10:58.875
SEXUALITY
AND ALL ITS DYSFUNCTIONS

10:58.875 --> 11:01.917
ARE INTRINSIC
TO THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE,

11:01.917 --> 11:04.959
MAYBE THE ONE THING
WE CAN ALL RELATE TO
AT THE END OF THE DAY--

11:04.959 --> 11:07.542
WELL, NEUROSIS
AND THE GOD THING ASIDE.

11:07.542 --> 11:11.166
AND THE REASON
THAT ROTH SEDUCED US

11:11.166 --> 11:13.166
AND MISS MORNING AFTER
HERE DIDN'T

11:13.166 --> 11:17.667
IS THAT WHILE ROTH ISN'T
AFRAID TO GET HIS HANDS
QUITE LITERALLY DIRTY

11:17.667 --> 11:20.834
WITH RAPID-FIRE
SENSUAL DESCRIPTION,

11:20.834 --> 11:21.500
OUR E-MAIL AUTHOR HERE

11:21.500 --> 11:24.333
DISTANCES HERSELF
FROM THE ACT

11:24.333 --> 11:27.000
WITH VAGUE METAPHORS.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.166
CAN'T BE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS

11:30.166 --> 11:33.000
IF YOU'RE OBSERVING
FROM THE SHORES...

11:33.000 --> 11:34.625
RIGHT?

11:37.500 --> 11:39.917
RIGHT.

11:55.041 --> 11:58.583
WELL...NO. I MEAN,
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND
THAT LOGIC, MR..."ENGEL."

11:58.583 --> 12:00.625
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
IF YOU INVEST IN
THIS STOCK RIGHT NOW,

12:00.625 --> 12:04.458
YOUR VALUE, I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'LL DOUBLE...EVENTUALLY.

12:04.458 --> 12:07.333
THE STOCK? WELL, THE STOCK--
THE STOCK IS STRONG.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.375
I MEAN, IF YOU--

12:08.375 --> 12:10.583
PERCENTAGE WISE?

12:10.583 --> 12:15.041
WELL, YEAH. YOU'RE PROBABLY
LOOKING AT A GOOD 15--HELLO?

12:15.041 --> 12:17.041
SMOOTH, WITTER.

12:17.041 --> 12:17.875
AH, THE GUY JUST
CAUGHT ME OFF-GUARD.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.792
LISTEN, YOU GOTTA
STOP MAKING EXCUSES.

12:19.792 --> 12:22.125
I'VE HEARD YOU ON
THE PHONE THIS MORNING.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.291
YOU THINK PEOPLE
ARE GONNA RELATE

12:23.291 --> 12:24.333
TO A PLUCKY, BLUE-COLLAR
KID FROM SOUTHIE?

12:24.333 --> 12:26.291
CAPESIDE.
WHATEVER.

12:26.291 --> 12:28.500
IT STILL REEKS
OF THE WHITE PICKET
AND THE BLACK LAB.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.542
YOU'RE TALKING
TO THESE PEOPLE

12:29.542 --> 12:30.458
LIKE YOU'RE
TRYING TO GET A DATE
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.583
"I'M PACEY.
I'M SENSITIVE.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.250
I CARE
ABOUT YOUR NEEDS."

12:33.250 --> 12:36.250
THAT'S THE ANGLE
OF THE GUY THAT'S TRYING
TO SELL THE HERALD.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.583
DON'T MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE
THE PRETTIEST GIRL
IN THE ROOM.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.041
MAKE THEM FEEL
LIKE MORONS FOR DOUBTING
YOUR FINANCIAL PROWESS.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.583
SO YOU ACTUALLY
WANT THESE PEOPLE
TO HANG UP ON ME?

12:42.583 --> 12:45.291
NO. I WANT THEM
TO BELIEVE YOU,

12:45.291 --> 12:46.500
WHICH IS NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN

12:46.500 --> 12:48.083
UNLESS YOU
PUT SOME HEART
INTO IT, WITTER.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.250
OK, FINE. HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO SELL THEM THE STOCK?

12:50.250 --> 12:51.458
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THE DAMNED THING IS.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.333
FIND YOUR IN
WITH THESE GUYS.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.417
BECOME THEM. BECOME
WHO THEY WANT TO BE.

12:56.417 --> 12:58.959
THINK WITH THOSE
JUDGMENTAL, AGEIST,

12:58.959 --> 13:02.250
RACIST, SEXIST,
STEREOTYPING PARTS
OF YOUR BRAIN

13:02.250 --> 13:04.333
THAT YOU'VE WORKED
SO HARD TO CONQUER.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.500
BELIEVE ME, YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA LAND A GUY
LIKE TOPPER

13:06.500 --> 13:07.708
PLAYIN' THE NICE GUY.

13:07.708 --> 13:08.792
AND WHO EXACTLY IS TOPPER?

13:08.792 --> 13:13.291
MR. ELI TOPPER
IS THE NEXT GUY
IN YOUR PILE,

13:13.291 --> 13:13.959
FANTASTICALLY HARD SELL.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.291
HE LIVES
IN A LITTLE APARTMENT

13:16.291 --> 13:17.041
ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF BOSTON,

13:17.041 --> 13:19.041
DOESN'T WANT TO
PAY THE CITY TAX.

13:19.041 --> 13:20.417
HE MADE HIS MONEY
IN THE EIGHTIES,

13:20.417 --> 13:21.792
AND NOW HE'S JUST
SITTIN' ON IT.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.458
WHY DO YOU BOTHER
GOING TO ALL THE TROUBLE
OF GETTIN' THAT MONEY

13:23.458 --> 13:24.750
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE IT
TO BETTER YOUR LIFE?

13:24.750 --> 13:28.917
GUYS LIKE TOPPER
BELIEVE IT CAN BUY THEM
AN UPGRADE IN HEAVEN.

13:28.917 --> 13:31.750
SINCE YOU AND I KNOW
WE'RE NEVER GOING THERE,

13:31.750 --> 13:33.125
GRAB YOUR KEYS.
WE'RE GOIN' OFF CAMPUS.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.625
OK, SO REMEMBER,
YOU CAN'T TECHNICALLY
POUR THE ALCOHOL,

13:42.625 --> 13:45.291
AT LEAST NOT WHILE
I'M ON WITH YOU.

13:45.291 --> 13:46.917
NO NEED TO BRING IN
THE VISA BEASTS.

13:46.917 --> 13:49.792
NO OFFENSE, EMMA,
BUT YOU DO KNOW I'VE WORKED
IN A RESTAURANT BEFORE.

13:49.792 --> 13:52.041
I'VE SEEN THEM BUILT.
I'VE SEEN THEM BURN DOWN,

13:52.041 --> 13:53.500
NOT THAT I HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.875
FASCINATING,

13:54.875 --> 13:57.041
BUT YOU'VE NEVER WORKED
IN THIS DIVE, NOW, HAVE YOU?

13:57.041 --> 13:59.959
COME ON, THEN.
HAVE A GO AT TABLE 3.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.875
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I WOULD THINK LONG
AND HARD

14:02.875 --> 14:04.458
BEFORE SENDING AN E-MAIL
LIKE THAT TO A GUY
I JUST SLEPT WITH.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.500
I KNOW, RIGHT?

14:06.500 --> 14:09.166
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU JUST
NEVER WANTED TO HEAR
FROM HIM AGAIN.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.834
DO YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT?

14:10.834 --> 14:12.333
COME ON.
NOT ALL GUYS
ARE LIKE THAT.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.208
OH, WHATEVER, MIKE.
YOU'RE GAY.

14:14.208 --> 14:15.875
CAN I HAVE A QUESADILLA
AND A PALE ALE?

14:15.875 --> 14:17.333
WELL, MAYBE
THE GUY IS GAY, TOO,

14:17.333 --> 14:18.667
AND THAT'S WHY
HE SCREWED HER OVER.

14:18.667 --> 14:19.500
OK, LOOK,

14:19.500 --> 14:22.000
SHE IS OBVIOUSLY
STARVING FOR ATTENTION,

14:22.000 --> 14:22.750
BROADCASTING IT
LIKE THAT?

14:22.750 --> 14:25.250
I MEAN, REALLY,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

14:25.250 --> 14:27.834
UNLESS YOU'RE ON
THE REAL WORLD
OR WHATEVER.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.458
YOU KNOW, MAYBE--
AND THIS IS JUST A SHOT
IN THE DARK--

14:30.458 --> 14:32.458
SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO
SEND IT TO THE GOSSIPS
AT LARGE.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.583
MAYBE SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO GET SOME
PRIVATE CLOSURE,

14:34.583 --> 14:35.625
NEVER DREAMED
SHE'D BE SUBJECTED

14:35.625 --> 14:38.750
TO THE OPRAH PSYCHOBABBLE
OF HER LIFE-LACKING PEERS.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.083
NOW, DO YOU GUYS
WANT SOMETHING TO EAT,

14:40.083 --> 14:41.750
OR SHOULD I JUST BRING
OVER A NICE TRAY OF BON-BONS

14:41.750 --> 14:43.667
SO YOU GUYS CAN HUNKER DOWN
AND WATCH YOUR STORIES?

14:43.667 --> 14:46.458
EH-HEE!
MAYBE LATER.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.208
(LAUGHTER)

14:51.291 --> 14:52.542
BOSTON BAY IS NOT
A PARTY SCHOOL, AUDREY.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.875
SPARE ME YOUR LIES,
JEN.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.667
I AM NOT GOING BACK
TO MY EVIL DEN
OF HIGHER LEARNING.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.333
THIS IS CLEARLY
WHERE IT'S AT.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.458
HEY, THE MIDDAY KEGGERS

14:59.458 --> 15:01.417
GET A LITTLE OLD
AFTER A FEW SEMESTERS,
TRUST ME.

15:01.417 --> 15:03.583
I TELL YOU WHAT,
I'M GONNA MEET
YOU GUYS IN THERE.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.041
I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO PROFESSOR FREEMAN.

15:05.041 --> 15:06.875
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A TAD TRACEY FLICK?

15:06.875 --> 15:08.834
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.166
SURE HE DOES.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.000
I'VE RAISED MY HAND
AND TALKED IN CLASS
A LOTTA TIMES.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.375
HE'S NOTICED.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.250
HE HAS.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.875
ALL RIGHT...
SWIM FAN.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.041
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO
TALK TO THAT BOY

15:20.041 --> 15:21.166
ABOUT HIS LOVE
OF THE STRAIGHTS.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.208
WHATEVER.
IT'S TOTALLY HOT.

15:25.583 --> 15:26.208
HEY.

15:26.208 --> 15:30.250
NOT A VERY BIG
TURN OUT, HUH?

15:30.250 --> 15:32.083
NO, UM,
APPARENTLY NOT.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.166
I GUESS NOT EVERYBODY

15:34.166 --> 15:38.500
IS AS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT
THE GIRL WHO CRIED UGLY
AS WE ARE.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.875
RIGHT.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.834
I'M SORRY.
DO I KNOW YOU?

15:45.250 --> 15:48.500
UH, NO. SORRY.
JACK McPHEE.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.792
I'M IN YOUR POP CULTURE CLASS?

15:49.792 --> 15:51.959
OH, I'M SORRY, JACK.
THAT CLASS IS MASSIVE,

15:51.959 --> 15:53.208
HARD TO
KEEP PEOPLE STRAIGHT.

15:53.208 --> 15:54.375
HEH HEH! I'LL BET.

15:54.375 --> 15:56.458
AHEM.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.500
I'LL--I'LL
SEE YOU IN THERE.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.166
OK.

16:05.542 --> 16:08.041
YOU'RE SURE I HAVEN'T
MADE A FANTASTIC
MISTAKE, THEN,

16:08.041 --> 16:08.959
LIVING WITH THOSE 2?

16:08.959 --> 16:09.834
NOPE. I'M SURE YOU
WON'T BE BORED.

16:09.834 --> 16:12.083
NOW, THAT'S
A COLD COMFORT.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.875
YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.708
HIM? YEAH, HE COMES
IN HERE ALL THE TIME.

16:19.708 --> 16:20.959
OH, OF COURSE HE DOES.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.166
HE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN ASSIGNED
TO RUIN MY LIFE,

16:23.166 --> 16:24.875
AND HE SEEMS DETERMINED
TO DO IT IN RECORD TIME.

16:24.875 --> 16:29.000
LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING
TO RUN FOR COVER

16:29.000 --> 16:31.125
EVERY TIME A DARK CLOUD
FORMS OVER YOUR HEAD.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.458
SO I SUGGEST
YOU NIP THIS IN THE BUD.

16:33.458 --> 16:34.708
IT'S ALL YOURS.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.000
I CAN SEE
WHY THIS JOINT WOULD
BE MUCH MORE ALLURING

16:44.000 --> 16:46.500
THAT THE CONFINES OF
THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT:

16:46.500 --> 16:48.792
ALL THAT SILENCE,
ALL THOSE BOOKS.

16:48.792 --> 16:51.542
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
YOUR CONSTANT
POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.208
YEAH. RIGHT.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.917
THAT WOULD
GET REALLY ANNOYING
AFTER A WHILE.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.542
ARE YOU WAITING
FOR ME TO ORDER,

16:59.542 --> 17:01.000
OR DID YOU HAVE
SOMETHIN' TO SAY?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
'CAUSE IT KINDA LOOKS
LIKE YOU'VE GOT YOUR
BONE-TO-PICK FACE ON.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.666
AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE?

17:04.666 --> 17:05.500
WORD GETS AROUND.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.625
I'LL JUST HAVE
A TUNA MELT
AND A BEER.

17:08.625 --> 17:09.875
SURE.

17:10.834 --> 17:11.583
PROFESSOR HETSON--

17:11.583 --> 17:14.000
OH, THERE YOU GO.
YEAH, HERE I GO.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.250
LOOK, I'M SURE YOUR
HARD-AS-NAILS THING
REALLY WORKS FOR YOU.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.541
I'M SURE IT
EARNS YOU RESPECT,

17:18.541 --> 17:20.666
AND I'M SURE THAT I
WILL LEARN A LOT
IN YOUR CLASS.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.375
BUT AFTER TODAY,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.208
I REALLY WISH YOU
WOULD'VE TURNED ME AWAY
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.916
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE FLATTERED
TO BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

17:26.916 --> 17:28.500
I DON'T SINGLE PEOPLE
OUT THAT OFTEN.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.542
CONTRARY TO WHAT
YOU APPARENTLY BELIEVE,

17:31.542 --> 17:33.542
I'M NOT AN IDIOT,
PROFESSOR HETSON,

17:33.542 --> 17:37.625
AND I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN
IN THE 20 MINUTES YOU SPENT
MOCKING MY FORMATIVE YEARS

17:37.625 --> 17:39.417
WAS A MAJOR OFF RAMP
FROM MODERN COMP LIT.

17:39.417 --> 17:43.834
AND I'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW,
DOES TODAY'S
TOTAL EVISCERATION

17:43.834 --> 17:45.834
EXONERATE ME, SAY,
THROUGH NOVEMBER,

17:45.834 --> 17:49.250
OR DOES THIS SORT
OF PUBLIC RIDICULE
DELIGHT YOU INDEFINITELY?

17:49.250 --> 17:51.125
WHY, I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN,

17:51.125 --> 17:53.583
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET INTO
THE POIGNANT RAMBLINGS
OF JOYCE AND WOOLF,

17:53.583 --> 17:56.000
AND YOUR WORK PROVIDES
SUCH A MARKED CONTRAST.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.083
HEY, JOEY...

17:59.083 --> 18:03.291
YOU DO FANCY YOURSELF
A WRITER, CORRECT?

18:03.291 --> 18:04.250
YEAH, YOU COULD
CALL IT A HOBBY.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.959
SO I'M SURE
THAT YOU'VE GATHERED
AT THIS POINT

18:06.959 --> 18:08.500
THAT ON TOP OF
BEING NEUROTIC

18:08.500 --> 18:10.250
AND PLAGUED
WITH SELF-DOUBT,

18:10.250 --> 18:12.417
WRITERS HAVE TO ENDURE
PUBLIC HUMILIATION
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.834
YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT WALKED
INTO MY OFFICE

18:14.834 --> 18:15.875
PROMISING ME
FEARLESS ACADEMIC EGO,

18:15.875 --> 18:18.083
BUT I HAVE YET
TO SEE IT.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.000
IF YOU CAN'T
HANDLE MY CLASS--

18:20.000 --> 18:21.708
AND COUNTLESS
HAVE DIED TRYING--

18:21.708 --> 18:24.208
WHY DON'T YOU JUST QUIT?

18:24.208 --> 18:25.667
I'M NOT A QUITTER.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.375
PEOPLE LOVE  SAYING THAT.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.000
IT'S LIKE THEY SAW IT
IN SOME MOVIE ONCE

18:29.000 --> 18:30.417
AND THEY LIKED
THE WAY IT SOUNDED.

18:30.417 --> 18:31.542
I'M NOT JUST SAYING IT, OK?

18:31.542 --> 18:33.250
I WANTED TO TAKE YOUR CLASS

18:33.250 --> 18:35.208
BECAUSE I WANTED TO
LEARN SOMETHING,
AND I WANTED TO WORK HARD,

18:35.208 --> 18:37.417
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
PERSONALLY RIDICULED
IN THE PROCESS.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.417
YOUR HEARTFELT RANT
TO WHAT'S HIS NAME

18:39.417 --> 18:41.583
PROVED GOOD FODDER
FOR THE TOPIC AT HAND.

18:41.583 --> 18:44.166
IT'S HARD TO
WRITE THAT SEX STUFF,

18:44.166 --> 18:45.917
WHICH YOU APTLY PROVED.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.959
AND IF,
BY CHANCE, ONE DAY

18:48.959 --> 18:51.250
YOU MANAGE TO GET
YOUR WRITING CIRCULATED

18:51.250 --> 18:52.667
BEYOND
THE CAMPUS IN BOX,

18:52.667 --> 18:56.417
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
AN IRRITABLE WRITER TYPE
CLAIMING TO DO BETTER.

18:56.417 --> 18:58.959
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS ONE TO GO OUT
INTO THE WORLD.

18:58.959 --> 19:00.625
WHATEVER. BYGONES.

19:00.625 --> 19:01.500
DECLARE VICTORY
AND MOVE ON.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.375
WHERE'S THE VICTORY
IN THIS LITTLE SCENARIO?

19:03.375 --> 19:07.542
ONE DOWN, ONLY
A LIFETIME OF PROVING
YOURSELF LEFT TO GO.

19:07.542 --> 19:10.917
AND IF YOU'RE
STAYING IN MY CLASS,

19:10.917 --> 19:13.667
START PROVING
THAT IT'S WORTH IT...

19:13.667 --> 19:15.458
TO ONE OF US, AT LEAST.

19:23.792 --> 19:28.083
MAN, YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
SLEEP IN THIS CAR, DO YOU?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.375
NOT RECENTLY.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.875
I JUST MOVED
INTO A NEW PLACE.

19:31.875 --> 19:35.750
GOOD 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO START FEELING SORRY
FOR YOU OR ANYTHING.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.417
YOU DON'T, UH, SEE THESE
AROUND MUCH ANYMORE.

19:38.417 --> 19:41.333
OH, COME ON, MAN.
THIS IS A GREAT CAR.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.792
I MEAN, SURE,
IT'S A LOT OF WORK,

19:42.792 --> 19:44.083
BUT SHE'S WORTH IT,
YOU KNOW?

19:44.083 --> 19:45.834
YEAH. TURN
INTO THAT DEALERSHIP
RIGHT OVER THERE.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.875
WHAT? ARE WE GOIN'
FOR A TEST DRIVE?

19:48.875 --> 19:50.500
EH HEH HEH!

19:50.500 --> 19:54.000
THAT'S ONE BONDING EXPERIENCE
THAT'S PASSED US BY.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.041
NO. THIS ONE IS SIGNED
AND PAID FOR.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.500
JUST PICKIN' IT UP.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.083
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

20:05.166 --> 20:08.500
YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY
BE GETTING A Z8.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.166
NICE, HUH?

20:10.166 --> 20:11.083
NICE?

20:11.083 --> 20:13.208
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLE
AFFORD A CAR LIKE THAT?

20:13.208 --> 20:14.834
YOU'RE NOT
THAT MUCH OLDER THAN ME.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.041
YES, BUT I'M SO MUCH WISER.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.125
DON'T SWEAT IT.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.708
MAYBE
IF YOU SNAG TOPPER,

20:19.708 --> 20:21.375
ALL THIS'LL BE YOURS
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.375
NICE CAR.

20:23.375 --> 20:24.959
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.375
HEY, I HAPPEN

20:26.375 --> 20:28.125
TO LIKE MY CAR,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.959
YEAH. YOU'VE GOT A WAY
TO GET AROUND TOWN,

20:30.959 --> 20:33.875
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT
WHAT YOUR CAR
SAYS ABOUT YOU.

20:33.875 --> 20:34.959
OK, I'LL BITE.

20:34.959 --> 20:37.458
WHAT DOES MY CAR
SAY ABOUT ME?

20:37.458 --> 20:41.667
THAT YOU'RE
A SENTIMENTAL FOOL
OF A MAN-CHILD.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.041
YOU'RE TOO WEAK
FOR A REAL CAR,

20:43.041 --> 20:45.375
SO YOU TINKER WITH
YOUR LITTLE MEDIUM-COOL
VINTAGE ONE.

20:45.375 --> 20:48.417
YOU SURROUND YOURSELF
WITH ALL THINGS GOOD,
BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

20:48.417 --> 20:52.375
YOU DON'T
WANT TO GROW UP, SO YOU
DON'T GO TO SCHOOL

20:52.375 --> 20:53.333
AND YOU BORROW
YOUR SUITS

20:53.333 --> 20:56.041
AND YOU
LET YOUR FACIAL HAIR
RUN AMUCK.

20:56.041 --> 20:58.417
THAT'S FINE, BUT THEN
WHY BOTHER GETTING
IN THE RING AT ALL

20:58.417 --> 21:01.083
IF YOU'RE
NOT EVEN GONNA THROW
A FRIGGIN' PUNCH?

21:01.083 --> 21:03.417
WHAT? ARE YOU GONNA GO
IN THAT OFFICE EVERY DAY

21:03.417 --> 21:04.875
AND WATCH GUYS
COLLECT THEIR MONEY

21:04.875 --> 21:06.917
SO YOU CAN WRITE
A THOUGHTFUL PIECE
ABOUT IT IN YOUR MEMOIRS?

21:06.917 --> 21:10.417
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THAT STUFF.

21:10.417 --> 21:11.708
MAYBE I'M JUST TRYIN'
TO PAY MY RENT.

21:11.708 --> 21:14.583
COME ON, PACEY.
I SEE SOMETHIN'
GOIN' ON IN THERE.

21:14.583 --> 21:17.542
YOU'RE NOT SUBJECTING
YOURSELF TO ME
BECAUSE YOU LIKE MY TIE.

21:17.542 --> 21:18.542
YOU'RE HUNGRY.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.917
SO QUIT EFFIN' AROUND
AND GO FOR IT ALREADY.

21:34.417 --> 21:35.458
HEY, I HEAR YOU, MR. TOPPER.

21:35.458 --> 21:36.875
WHEN MY FATHER NEEDED
AN OPEN HEART,

21:36.875 --> 21:39.083
I DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH MY SAVINGS.
HE GOT HIMSELF INTO THAT MESS,

21:39.083 --> 21:40.542
HE CAN GET HIMSELF OUT.
RIGHT?

21:40.542 --> 21:42.792
BUT LOOK, YOU AND I
ARE BOTH VERY BUSY MEN,

21:42.792 --> 21:46.166
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT THIS STOCK
TODAY, THAT'S FINE BY ME.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.417
I'M JUST GONNA CALL ONE
OF OUR MORE ACTIVE BUYERS.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.291
WELL, YES. THE...
THE PACKET OF INFORMATION

21:53.291 --> 21:55.583
THAT MY COMPANY SENT YOU
IS CERTAINLY WORTH
TAKING A LOOK AT...

21:55.583 --> 21:58.792
BUT IT IS NOTHING COMPARED
TO WHAT LANDED ON MY DESK
THIS MORNING.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.625
BUT, LOOK, YOU AND I...
WE BOTH KNOW--

22:00.625 --> 22:02.291
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF OUR
MORE ACTIVE BUYERS,

22:02.291 --> 22:04.250
SO IF YOU'RE NOT
INTERESTED IN THIS,
THAT'S FINE BY ME.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.792
JUST TELL ME RIGHT NOW, OK?
SPARE ME THE NICETIES, 'CAUSE
I AM NOT YOUR PROM DATE.

22:06.792 --> 22:10.333
I'LL JUST CALL MY OTHER GUY.
I MEAN, I MADE HIM
50 GRAND LAST WEEK.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.417
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE
MY CALL. RIGHT?

22:15.959 --> 22:17.959
OK, SO HERE'S THE STORY.

22:17.959 --> 22:21.875
THE BUYERS IN THE MARKET
ARE PLAYING IT PRETTY CLOSE
TO THE VEST RIGHT NOW.

22:21.875 --> 22:23.291
BUT WHEN THEY WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING,

22:23.291 --> 22:24.708
THEY'RE GONNA BE KICKIN'
THEMSELVES, LITERALLY,

22:24.708 --> 22:27.583
BECAUSE THE BUYING PRICE
ON THIS  WILL HAVE DOUBLED.

22:27.583 --> 22:31.083
AND IF YOU GET IN RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE GONNA BE BEATIN' THE GUYS
WHO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,

22:31.083 --> 22:32.834
REMEMBER THAT THEY
ACTUALLY HAVE A PAIR,

22:32.834 --> 22:36.458
AND THAT GREED IS GOOD, ELI.
AND THE SUCKER DOWN THE STREET,

22:36.458 --> 22:38.333
HE'S NEVER GONNA KNOW
THE JOY THAT YOU KNOW

22:38.333 --> 22:41.834
BECAUSE BY GETTING IN EARLY,
YOU MADE 10 TIMES THE PROFIT
THAT HE DID,

22:41.834 --> 22:43.458
AND THAT'S SOMETHIN'
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO RUB IN HIS FACE

22:43.458 --> 22:46.250
EVERY TIME
YOU PICK UP YOUR PAPER.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.708
AH. I KNEW YOU WERE
A SMART MAN

22:51.708 --> 22:53.125
THE SECOND YOU PICKED UP
THE PHONE, ELI.

22:53.125 --> 22:55.834
(CHUCKLES) UM, LET ME
JUST PUT YOU THROUGH
TO MY ASSISTANT,

22:55.834 --> 22:58.375
AND, UH, YOU CAN GIVE HER
ALL YOUR INFORMATION.

22:58.375 --> 23:01.083
IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE
DOIN' BUSINESS WITH YOU.

23:03.792 --> 23:06.875
Rich: THANKS, GUYS.
LATHAM, GET ME
THAT SPREADSHEET BY 3:00.

23:09.417 --> 23:11.959
DON'T YOU KNOCK, WITTER?
I COULD'VE BEEN HAVIN'
A NOONER.

23:11.959 --> 23:12.583
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE.

23:12.583 --> 23:14.875
ANYWAY, GUESS WHAT.
IN FACT,

23:14.875 --> 23:16.625
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T GUESS.
YOU'LL RUIN IT FOR ME.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.458
I...JUST CLOSED TOPPER.

23:18.458 --> 23:19.792
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
NO, MY FRIEND, I'M NOT.
I CLOSED TOPPER.

23:19.792 --> 23:23.750
I SOLD HIM SOME BS LINE
FROM AN EIGHTIES MOVIE,
AND HE BOUGHT IT.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.083
IT WAS LIKE
I WAS A PROFILER.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.250
I COULD SMELL
THE CHEAP BEER
ON THIS GUY'S BREATH.

23:26.250 --> 23:29.208
HE WOULD RATHER
BUY STOCK TODAY AND
ASK QUESTIONS TOMORROW

23:29.208 --> 23:31.875
JUST SO LONG AS
HE'S THE RICHEST GUY
ON THE BLOCK THAT WEEK.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.083
IT'S AMAZING.
I SELL, HE BUYS.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.542
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

23:35.542 --> 23:37.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.166
MAN. WITTER,
I KNEW YOU WERE
A SNEAKY LITTLE TWERP,

23:41.166 --> 23:43.291
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D PULL THIS  ON ME.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.417
NOT TODAY. COME HERE.
GIVE ME A HUG.

23:45.417 --> 23:46.667
YOU SERIOUS?

23:46.667 --> 23:48.542
NO. BUT GO
TO THAT REFRIGERATOR
AND GET US

23:48.542 --> 23:51.583
SOME ICY-COLD BEVERAGES.
I'M PROUD OF YOU, SON.

23:51.583 --> 23:51.708
WILL DO!

23:55.917 --> 23:58.583
(SIGHS)

23:58.583 --> 24:00.583
SO ANYWAY,
I'LL SEE YOU TUESDAY.

24:01.917 --> 24:03.458
HEY,
PROFESSOR FREEMAN.

24:04.083 --> 24:05.166
HI. JACK, RIGHT?

24:05.166 --> 24:06.125
YEAH.

24:06.125 --> 24:08.625
YEAH. THAT'S JACK.
I'M JEN.

24:08.625 --> 24:09.917
I'M IN YOUR CLASS,
TOO.

24:09.917 --> 24:11.250
THAT'S RIGHT. I'VE SEEN
YOU TWO SIT TOGETHER.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.417
MM-HMM.

24:12.417 --> 24:13.333
HI.

24:13.333 --> 24:15.959
AM I LOSING MY MIND?
ARE YOU IN MY CLASS, TOO?

24:15.959 --> 24:19.417
NO! NO, I'M JUST
A REALLY BIG FAN
OF YOUR WORK. YOU KNOW?

24:19.417 --> 24:22.458
AND THE--AND THE WORK
OF...BEAUTIFUL, UGLY
WOMEN EVERYWHERE,

24:22.458 --> 24:25.125
AND I'M--I'M REALLY
JUST...INTERESTED

24:25.125 --> 24:26.959
IN THIS PURE CULTURE
OF OURS, AND...

24:26.959 --> 24:30.417
YEAH, SO...
DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GO
VISIT JOEY AT WORK

24:30.417 --> 24:31.917
AND PARTAKE
IN SOME REFRESHMENTS?
PROFESSOR,

24:31.917 --> 24:33.625
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO JOIN US IF YOU'RE
INTO THE WHOLE

24:33.625 --> 24:36.000
CROSSING THE LINE
KIND OF THING.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.041
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

24:37.041 --> 24:38.083
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GET THE CAR,

24:38.083 --> 24:39.625
AND I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE CORNER.

24:39.625 --> 24:40.792
YOU'RE GONNA LET ME
DRIVE THE SAAB?

24:40.792 --> 24:42.166
(CHUCKLES)

24:42.166 --> 24:43.625
OF COURSE, JENNIFER.
WHY WOULDN'T I?

24:43.625 --> 24:44.417
UH, SO WHY DON'T
YOU TWO SKEDADDLE,

24:44.417 --> 24:46.250
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN A SECOND?

24:46.250 --> 24:47.375
OK.

24:47.375 --> 24:48.500
OK.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.125
(GIGGLE)

24:49.125 --> 24:50.917
(BOTH MEN CHUCKLE)

24:50.917 --> 24:52.792
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
AT LEAST I KNOW WHO'S
NOT  IN MY CLASS. RIGHT?

24:52.792 --> 24:55.125
YEAH.

24:55.917 --> 24:58.041
DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING
INSIDE, JACK?

24:58.041 --> 25:02.166
OH. NO. UH, NO.
LOOK, I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO KNOW WHO I AM.

25:02.166 --> 25:05.000
I JUST WANTED TO TELL
YOU THAT, UH, I REALLY
ENJOY YOUR CLASS.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.375
OH, W--
AND I HAVEN'T REALLY
CARED ABOUT SCHOOL
IN A WHILE.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.166
IN FACT, I HAVEN'T
REALLY CARED ABOUT
ANYTHING IN A WHILE.

25:09.166 --> 25:11.875
BUT, YOU KNOW, SEEING
THE WORK THAT YOU PUT
INTO YOUR LECTURES

25:11.875 --> 25:13.708
AND SEEING A TEACHER
THAT'S INVESTED
IN BEING INTERESTING

25:13.708 --> 25:16.166
AND DYNAMIC IN CLASS
AND NOT JUST TRYIN'
TO BLOW

25:16.166 --> 25:19.291
THROUGH ANOTHER 50 MINUTES,
IT JUST, YOU KNOW, REALLY...
MEANS A LOT TO ME.

25:19.291 --> 25:20.834
I DIDN'T EVEN REALLY KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA DECLARE
AS A MAJOR,

25:20.834 --> 25:24.458
BUT NOW IT'S, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S THE WAY
THAT YOU WORD THINGS

25:24.458 --> 25:26.542
OR IT'S
THE SUBJECT MATTER,
BUT...

25:26.542 --> 25:29.792
I WALK AWAY FROM CLASS
STILL THINKING' ABOUT IT,
AND--AND, YOU KNOW,

25:29.792 --> 25:31.834
I JUST LOOK FORWARD
TO THE NEXT TIME,
AND, UH...

25:31.834 --> 25:34.750
I WAS JUST WONDERIN'
HOW I COULD BECOME
MORE...

25:34.750 --> 25:35.041
INVOLVED.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.667
YOU KNOW.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.875
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)
ARE WE TALKIN'
ABOUT THE CLASS, JACK,

25:40.875 --> 25:42.458
OR ARE WE TALKIN'
ABOUT ME?

25:42.458 --> 25:44.458
W-WHA--NO. NO.

25:44.458 --> 25:48.750
OH. UM...NO, THAT'S
NOT WHAT I MEANT.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.917
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW--
I--I MEAN, I'M NOT--
WELL, I AM, BUT--

25:50.917 --> 25:52.625
DON'T SWEAT IT.
UM...

25:52.625 --> 25:54.291
LOOK, I'M GLAD
YOU LIKE THE CLASS.

25:54.291 --> 25:57.125
AND, UH...AND I THINK
IT'LL SHOW IN YOUR WORK
THIS SEMESTER.

25:58.959 --> 26:00.875
I-I'M WALKIN'
THIS WAY.
ARE YOU?

26:01.708 --> 26:03.417
YEAH. YEAH.

26:05.291 --> 26:07.000
Pacey: BUT, MR. FRICKEE,
I'M TELLING YOU,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.041
IT'S A ONE-TIME--

26:08.041 --> 26:09.667
HELLO?

26:09.667 --> 26:11.208
CHEAP BASTARD.

26:11.208 --> 26:12.500
ANY LUCK?

26:12.500 --> 26:13.542
UH, NO,
NOT ON THAT ONE.

26:13.542 --> 26:16.000
YEAH, KNEW YOU WERE
A ONE-HIT WONDER.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.375
YOU WISH, MAN.

26:18.375 --> 26:19.708
HERE, SPORT. BUY
YOURSELF SOME LUNCH.

26:21.834 --> 26:23.041
ARE YOU KIDDING?

26:23.041 --> 26:25.500
NO, YOU GOTTA WORK
YOUR WAY UP HERE.
COME ON, DO IT FAST.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.834
NO ONE ELSE IS
GETTING LUNCH TODAY.

26:26.834 --> 26:28.250
THEY'LL THINK
I'VE GONE SOFT.

26:28.250 --> 26:28.708
5 MINUTES.

26:36.959 --> 26:38.333
Man: DID ANYONE HEAR IT?

26:38.333 --> 26:39.250
NO, MAN, BUT JOHNSON
SAID IT WAS KILLER.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.166
YEAH?
YEAH.

26:41.166 --> 26:41.917
SAID IT WAS LIKE
HE SMELLED THE BLOOD

26:41.917 --> 26:44.583
AND DIDN'T STOP
UNTIL HE TASTED IT.

26:44.583 --> 26:46.000
(ALL LAUGH)

26:46.000 --> 26:48.583
HE IS SO FRICKIN'
AWESOME.
MMM.

26:48.583 --> 26:49.625
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:49.625 --> 26:50.750
OH, YOU DIDN'T HEAR?

26:50.750 --> 26:51.166
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING.

26:51.166 --> 26:53.291
RINALDI, MAN.

26:53.291 --> 26:54.458
HE CLOSED TOPPER.

26:54.458 --> 26:54.917
(ALL LAUGH)

26:54.917 --> 26:56.959
WHAT?

26:56.959 --> 26:57.917
THEY SAID IT
COULDN'T BE DONE.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.458
THE GUY IS, LIKE,
MY PERSONAL GOD.

27:00.458 --> 27:02.583
(ALL LAUGH)
HEY, EASE UP,
HENDERSON.

27:02.583 --> 27:04.917
YOU'RE LOOKIN'
A LITTLE LIGHT
IN THE LOAFERS.

27:04.917 --> 27:05.458
HEY, YOU THINK
HE'LL GET A PARTNER
FOR THAT?

27:05.458 --> 27:06.708
OH, HE'LL
GET SOMETHING.

27:08.708 --> 27:10.542
YOU GONNA PICK
SOMETHING OR NOT?

27:10.959 --> 27:12.166
UH, NO, MAN. UH...

27:12.166 --> 27:14.125
LOOK, IN FACT,

27:14.125 --> 27:15.625
THIS ONE'S ON ME.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.125
ENJOY YOURSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

27:23.959 --> 27:25.792
HEY. YOU START TODAY?

27:25.792 --> 27:25.834
SO IT WOULD APPEAR.

27:28.291 --> 27:30.375
UH, I NEED 2 BEERS
AND A VODKA TONIC.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.208
UM, EMMA'S IN THE BACK.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.291
OH, YEAH, RIGHT, YOU CAN'T
POUR YOUR OWN DRINKS.

27:34.291 --> 27:36.542
WELL, THIS SHOULD BE FUN,

27:36.542 --> 27:37.625
BABY-SITTING YOU ON TOP
OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

27:37.625 --> 27:39.750
AND WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

27:39.750 --> 27:40.583
OH, DON'T GET
ALL FIRED UP, OK?

27:40.583 --> 27:42.750
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
NOT IN THE MOOD

27:42.750 --> 27:43.750
TO TAKE ON YOUR RAGE
AT THE WORLD TONIGHT.

27:43.750 --> 27:47.208
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE JUST
AS OVERSENSITIVE TOMORROW.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.875
OH, I GET IT. YOU WANNA
SEE ME CRACK, HUH?

27:49.875 --> 27:51.708
THE ENDLESS HORRORS
OF THE DAY ARE A WASTE

27:51.708 --> 27:53.500
UNLESS THEY RESULT
IN MY NERVOUS BREAKDOWN?

27:53.500 --> 27:54.458
OH, WHAT, DID YOU HAVE
A BAD DAY OR SOMETHING?

27:54.458 --> 27:55.834
OH, LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

27:55.834 --> 27:58.041
TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T
SHOW UP FOR CLASS TODAY

27:58.041 --> 28:00.708
AND HEAR HETSON'S
BRILLIANT CRITIQUE
OF MY E-MAIL.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.500
THAT WAS THE HIGH POINT,
I THINK,

28:02.500 --> 28:05.291
ALTHOUGH I ALSO LOVED
WALKING INTO ROOMS

28:05.291 --> 28:06.417
TO HEAR PEOPLE WHISPERING
AND LAUGHING AT ME,

28:06.417 --> 28:08.500
AND THEN THERE'S
NOTHING BETTER

28:08.500 --> 28:09.583
THAN REACHING
FOR THE LAST JELL-O

28:09.583 --> 28:11.208
AND GETTING
UNSOLICITED SEXUAL ADVICE
FROM A STRANGER.

28:11.208 --> 28:13.792
SOUNDS FASCINATING.

28:13.792 --> 28:14.708
SORRY I MISSED IT.

28:14.708 --> 28:16.625
YOU KNOW, CONTRARY
TO POPULAR BELIEF,

28:16.625 --> 28:17.708
I DIDN'T SEND THAT E-MAIL

28:17.708 --> 28:19.625
TO GET FEEDBACK FROM YOU
AND EVERYONE ELSE,

28:19.625 --> 28:21.583
AND I WAS KIND OF THINKING
THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN MOCKED

28:21.583 --> 28:22.875
FOR THE BETTER PART
OF THE DAY,

28:22.875 --> 28:23.708
MAYBE YOU COULD SPARE ME
AND CONCENTRATE

28:23.708 --> 28:27.583
ON YOUR OWN DEEP UNHAPPINESS
FOR A WHILE.

28:27.583 --> 28:30.000
YOU KNOW, STRANGELY,
BEFORE YOU GOT ALL...

28:30.000 --> 28:31.333
CRAZY CONFESSIONAL
ON ME,

28:31.333 --> 28:33.500
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS DOING.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.834
I HADN'T BEEN PLANNING
HOW TO BEST TORTURE YOU.

28:34.834 --> 28:38.500
YOU SEE, WE DON'T JUST
WALK OFF INTO A VOID

28:38.500 --> 28:39.708
WHEN WE LEAVE
YOUR LINE OF VISION.

28:39.708 --> 28:41.917
SOME OF US EVEN HAVE
OUR OWN LIVES

28:41.917 --> 28:44.625
AND DON'T EVEN TALK
ABOUT YOU AT ALL.

28:44.625 --> 28:48.583
NOW, I'M SORRY
THAT SOME BRUTAL
IVY LEAGUE KIDS

28:48.583 --> 28:49.500
MADE FUN
OF YOUR E-MAIL TODAY.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.583
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

28:51.583 --> 28:52.125
I'M NOT MUCH OF
AN INTERNET KIND OF GUY,

28:52.125 --> 28:53.500
SO, SADLY,

28:53.500 --> 28:56.000
I HAVE MISSED
YET ANOTHER ASPECT

28:56.000 --> 28:57.834
OF YOUR RIVETING,
CHARMED LIFE.

28:57.834 --> 29:00.583
BUT IF YOU CAN'T
POUR THE DRINKS,

29:00.583 --> 29:04.166
CAN YOU AT LEAST
SERVE THEM?

29:04.166 --> 29:06.333
THANKS.

29:14.542 --> 29:16.375
AHH...

29:18.750 --> 29:20.208
WITTER.

29:20.208 --> 29:21.208
THOUGHT YOU'D GONE HOME.

29:21.208 --> 29:21.959
YEAH, I FIGURED
YOU WERE WAITING

29:21.959 --> 29:24.917
SO YOU COULD SNEAK OUT
THE BACK DOOR.

29:24.917 --> 29:26.417
BUT I JUST HAD A QUESTION
I HAD TO ASK YOU,

29:26.417 --> 29:28.291
AND--AND, PLEASE,

29:28.291 --> 29:30.250
DO ME A FAVOR AND JUST
SPARE ME THE DIME STORE SPEECH

29:30.250 --> 29:32.458
ON WHAT A SUCKER I AM
UNTIL I'VE LEFT, OKAY?

29:32.458 --> 29:33.750
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU
ANYTHING.

29:33.750 --> 29:35.083
YEAH, I'M GETTIN' THAT.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.458
I JUST--I WANTED TO ASK YOU

29:36.458 --> 29:39.291
WHY YOU BOTHER WITH THE ACT,

29:39.291 --> 29:40.834
WITH THE WHOLE, YOU KNOW--
THE "TOUGH LOVE,

29:40.834 --> 29:42.583
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE ROPES" ACT?

29:42.583 --> 29:45.458
'CAUSE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
WANT ME TO SUCCEED, DO YOU?

29:45.458 --> 29:47.250
IN FACT, YOU'RE PRAYING
FOR ME TO FAIL.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.625
THAT WAY YOU HAVE
ONE LESS SHEEP
IN THE HERD, RIGHT?

29:49.625 --> 29:51.625
AND IF I DO SUCCEED,
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
BE MY FRIEND?

29:51.625 --> 29:54.041
NO, THEN YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP ON TAKING MY MONEY

29:54.041 --> 29:54.625
THAT I EARNED

29:54.625 --> 29:57.000
AND COUNTING IT AS YOUR OWN.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.166
DO YOU NEED ME HERE
FOR THIS, OR...

29:59.166 --> 30:01.458
WELL, I JUST WANNA KNOW
WHY YOU BOTHER!

30:01.458 --> 30:03.000
WHY WOULD YOU
TAKE THE TIME

30:03.000 --> 30:05.166
OUT OF A BUSY DAY
TO BUILD SOMEONE UP

30:05.166 --> 30:06.750
AND MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE
THEY WERE WORTH SOMETHING

30:06.750 --> 30:09.333
IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA
STEAL ALL THEIR GLORY
AT THE END ANYWAY?

30:09.333 --> 30:10.458
THIS IS A BUSINESS.

30:10.458 --> 30:13.041
I DIDN'T WAKE UP
THIS MORNING LOOKING
FOR SOME PLUCKY KID

30:13.041 --> 30:14.291
TO TAKE UNDER MY WING.

30:14.291 --> 30:17.166
I CAME HERE TO DO MY JOB,
JUST LIKE EVERY DAY.

30:17.166 --> 30:18.792
RUNNING YOU HARD?
YEAH, THAT'S MY JOB.

30:18.792 --> 30:20.542
SINGING YOUR PRAISES ISN'T.

30:20.542 --> 30:21.875
LANDING TOPPER,
THAT WAS A FLUKE.

30:21.875 --> 30:24.041
A GENIUS FLUKE,
BUT A FLUKE NONETHELESS.

30:24.041 --> 30:25.667
WE DON'T HAND THOSE DEALS
OVER TO THE LITTLE GUYS.

30:25.667 --> 30:28.166
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
TAKEN YOUR SERIES 7.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.959
THAT BODES WELL
FOR THE FUTURE,

30:29.959 --> 30:31.750
BUT TODAY? IT MEANS NOTHING.

30:31.750 --> 30:32.750
SO, WHAT,
I'M JUST SUPPOSED

30:32.750 --> 30:34.959
TO TURN THE OTHER WAY
ON THIS?

30:34.959 --> 30:36.542
I'M SUPPOSED TO SLAP
YOU ON THE BACK,

30:36.542 --> 30:37.625
CONGRATULATE YOU
ON A JOB WELL DONE

30:37.625 --> 30:38.500
LIKE THE REST
OF YOUR MINIONS?

30:38.500 --> 30:42.333
NO, MAN! THAT IS NOT
WHY I CAME HERE.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.125
YOU CAN DO
WHAT YOU WANNA DO.

30:44.125 --> 30:46.333
MAYBE YOU'D RATHER
CONTINUE FLOATING NUMBLY

30:46.333 --> 30:47.834
IN THE STATUS QUO.

30:47.834 --> 30:49.291
MAYBE YOU WANNA BE ME,

30:49.291 --> 30:51.917
AND THAT'S SO SCARY
YOU CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.375
SO WALK AWAY, WITTER.

30:53.375 --> 30:54.834
IT'S WHAT YOU DO.

30:54.834 --> 30:55.500
AND THIS IS WHAT I DO,

30:55.500 --> 30:58.125
AND I'M FREAKIN' GOOD AT IT.

30:58.125 --> 30:59.250
YOU WISH YOU WERE THIS GOOD,

30:59.250 --> 31:00.625
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU BOTHER TRYING.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.583
YOU THINK SOMEONE DIDN'T DO
THE EXACT SAME THING TO ME?

31:09.208 --> 31:11.708
(LAUGHS)

31:20.250 --> 31:22.375
Jack: DONE LIKE
A TRUE PROFESSIONAL.

31:22.375 --> 31:23.959
MORE LIKE
A PERMANENT BAR WENCH.

31:23.959 --> 31:25.750
SORRY IT WAS
SUCH A BAD DAY, JO.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.250
SERVES ME RIGHT.
WE DON'T TAKE KINDLY

31:27.250 --> 31:28.542
TO CLOSURE
IN THESE PARTS.

31:28.542 --> 31:30.458
YOU KNOW,
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

31:30.458 --> 31:32.708
I HARDLY HEARD
ABOUT THE E-MAIL
ALL DAY LONG.

31:32.708 --> 31:33.500
AUDREY, YOU WEREN'T
ON CAMPUS ALL DAY.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.875
DETAILS, JOEY!

31:35.875 --> 31:36.625
DOES DAWSON
EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT?

31:36.625 --> 31:37.792
NO, THAT'S THE THING.

31:37.792 --> 31:40.708
I MEAN, IT WASN'T
EVEN ADDRESSED TO HIM.

31:40.708 --> 31:42.625
MY INTIMATE AFTERMATH WAS
DISCUSSED IN ENGLISH CLASS,

31:42.625 --> 31:44.792
BUT DAWSON
WILL NEVER KNOW.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.875
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
NOT SUCH A BAD THING,

31:47.875 --> 31:49.500
BECAUSE THIS WAY

31:49.500 --> 31:50.542
THERE'S A LITTLE MORE SPACE
BETWEEN YOU GUYS,

31:50.542 --> 31:52.792
AND, UH, TECHNICALLY,

31:52.792 --> 31:53.959
YOU STILL HAVE
A CLEAN SLATE.

31:53.959 --> 31:54.959
Jack: YEAH,
SERIOUSLY, I MEAN,

31:54.959 --> 31:57.125
PERSONAL HUMILIATION
COULD'VE BEEN
A LOT WORSE

31:57.125 --> 31:58.834
THAN THE PUBLIC KIND.
YEAH.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.667
WHAT DREAM WORLD
ARE YOU TWO
LIVING IN?

32:01.667 --> 32:02.959
Audrey: OH...

32:02.959 --> 32:04.333
RIGHT. SORRY.

32:04.333 --> 32:05.750
OK, SO, I HAVE AN IDEA,

32:05.750 --> 32:07.583
I'LL BE,
LIKE, YOUR SPONSOR,

32:07.583 --> 32:09.667
AND THEN THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE JONESING

32:09.667 --> 32:11.208
TO EXPRESS YOURSELF,
YOU CAN JUST CALL ME.

32:12.417 --> 32:14.208
HEY.

32:14.208 --> 32:14.417
Audrey: PACEY!

32:14.417 --> 32:16.250
OHH!

32:16.250 --> 32:18.083
OH, DEAR, LORD.
AAH!

32:18.083 --> 32:19.250
TODAY WAS TERRIBLE!

32:19.250 --> 32:20.417
DON'T EVER
GO BACK TO WORK,

32:20.417 --> 32:20.792
NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER!

32:20.792 --> 32:21.583
DON'T TEMPT ME.

32:21.583 --> 32:24.417
OHH, YOU KNOW
I WILL!

32:24.417 --> 32:25.708
HEY, GUYS.

32:25.708 --> 32:28.083
HELLO, MR. WITTER. WE'RE
NOT DRINKING, WE SWEAR.

32:28.083 --> 32:29.000
ROUGH DAY.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.583
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW
THE HALF OF IT.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.208
CAN YOU SAVE A SEAT
FOR ME? I'M GONNA
GO FRESHEN UP.

32:32.208 --> 32:33.750
YEAH.

32:36.417 --> 32:37.667
IS HE OK?

32:37.667 --> 32:38.708
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S NOT
MY FAULT,

32:38.708 --> 32:39.708
I SWEAR.

32:39.708 --> 32:40.917
JOEY,

32:40.917 --> 32:42.333
WHO IS THAT?

32:45.625 --> 32:46.667
EDDIE.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.708
HE IS A RUGGEDLY
DREAMY SORT.

32:48.708 --> 32:49.667
HE'S GOT A MAJOR CHIP
ON HIS SHOULDER,

32:49.667 --> 32:52.125
THE SIZE OF WHICH RIVALS

32:52.125 --> 32:54.166
ONLY THE ONE
ON MY SHOULDER.

32:54.166 --> 32:55.208
HE'S OK.

32:55.208 --> 32:56.291
IS EMMA STILL HERE?

32:56.291 --> 32:57.959
UH, NO, SHE LEFT
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

32:57.959 --> 32:59.458
I THINK
SHE WAS HEADING HOME.

32:59.458 --> 33:00.250
HOW IS IT LIVING
WITH HER?

33:00.250 --> 33:02.125
DOES SHE RUN AROUND
IN HER UNDERWEAR

33:02.125 --> 33:04.000
AND ASK YOU GUYS
TO ZIP THINGS UP
FOR HER?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.500
THAT'S FUNNY.

33:05.500 --> 33:08.083
ACTUALLY, THE THREE OF US
TOOK A BATH TOGETHER
THIS MORNING.

33:08.083 --> 33:10.041
AND I THOUGHT YOU ONLY
TOOK BATHS WITH GRAMS.

33:10.041 --> 33:12.917
HEY, CAN WE GO GET
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR
FOR A SEC?

33:12.917 --> 33:13.166
OF COURSE, HONEY.

33:19.834 --> 33:21.750
Audrey: PACEY,
THAT IS BULL!

33:21.750 --> 33:23.333
YOU CAN'T LET THIS GUY
GET AWAY WITH IT.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.708
HE'S JUST GONNA
KEEP DOING IT!

33:24.708 --> 33:25.458
I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT HE WILL,

33:25.458 --> 33:26.792
BUT I DON'T THINK
TATTLING ON HIM

33:26.792 --> 33:27.917
IS GONNA DO ANY GOOD.

33:27.917 --> 33:29.250
THIS IS THE WAY
THAT THEY DO BUSINESS.

33:29.250 --> 33:30.333
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
GETTING IN,

33:30.333 --> 33:31.417
BUT I KNOW IT NOW.

33:31.417 --> 33:32.083
THE ONLY QUESTION
THAT REMAINS IS

33:32.083 --> 33:34.000
HOW DO I GET
THROUGH THE DAYS?

33:35.208 --> 33:36.166
WELL,
THAT DOESN'T SOUND

33:36.166 --> 33:38.458
LIKE THE GREATEST
WAY TO LIVE.

33:38.458 --> 33:39.625
PACEY, YOU'RE
20 YEARS OLD

33:39.625 --> 33:42.959
AND YOU'RE
ALREADY WAITING
FOR TIME TO PASS.

33:42.959 --> 33:45.125
HONEY,
WHY DON'T YOU QUIT?

33:45.125 --> 33:46.500
OHH, BECAUSE
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.875
YES, IT IS!

33:48.875 --> 33:50.375
PACEY, THESE ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE,

33:50.375 --> 33:52.834
LIKE, THE EASIEST DAYS
OF OUR LIVES.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.333
I MEAN, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN THERE

33:54.333 --> 33:55.875
WITH OUR FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW,

33:55.875 --> 33:57.875
COMING UP WITH
RIDICULOUS DRINKING GAMES

33:57.875 --> 34:00.333
AND MAKING
EACH OTHER LAUGH.

34:00.333 --> 34:01.250
I THINK WE'VE ALL
KIND OF FIGURED OUT

34:01.250 --> 34:03.834
THAT THE REAL WORLD IS
A PRETTY CRAPPY PLACE,

34:03.834 --> 34:05.542
SO WHAT'S THE RUSH
IN GETTING THERE?

34:05.542 --> 34:06.834
BECAUSE SOONER
OR LATER YOU RUN OUT

34:06.834 --> 34:07.917
OF PLACES TO HIDE.

34:07.917 --> 34:10.750
AUDREY, YOU SEEM
TO BE OPERATING

34:10.750 --> 34:11.875
UNDER THE ASSUMPTION
THAT YOU CAN DO

34:11.875 --> 34:14.166
WHATEVER YOU LIKE,
AND YOU JUST CAN'T!

34:14.166 --> 34:15.208
I MADE THE GRAVE MISTAKE
OF PEEKING BEHIND THE CURTAIN,

34:15.208 --> 34:17.708
AND NOW I CAN'T PRETEND
THAT I THINK THE FANTASY

34:17.708 --> 34:18.583
IS THE SAME AS THE REALITY.

34:18.583 --> 34:20.375
PLUS, I'VE BEEN KILLING
TIME FOR TOO LONG.

34:20.375 --> 34:22.125
I WANNA MAKE
SOMETHING FOR MYSELF,

34:22.125 --> 34:23.083
WHETHER IT'S EASY OR NOT.

34:23.083 --> 34:24.542
WELL, I'M SORRY
THAT YOU FEEL

34:24.542 --> 34:27.375
LIKE I'VE BEEN
A COLOSSAL WASTE
OF YOUR TIME.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.333
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN,

34:30.333 --> 34:31.542
AND YOU KNOW IT.

34:31.542 --> 34:33.875
YOU AND I COME FROM
VERY DIFFERENT WORLDS,

34:33.875 --> 34:35.375
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

34:35.375 --> 34:36.291
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN THINK
I REALIZED HOW DIFFERENT

34:36.291 --> 34:38.625
UNTIL I WENT OUT TO L.A.
WITH YOU THIS SUMMER.

34:38.625 --> 34:40.542
MY DAD IS
A HEARTLESS OLD FOOL

34:40.542 --> 34:41.667
JUST LIKE YOUR DAD.

34:41.667 --> 34:42.500
HE JUST WEARS
MORE EXPENSIVE SUITS,
THAT'S ALL.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.083
YES, HE DOES.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.250
I'M NOT EXPRESSING THIS
VERY WELL, AM I?

34:48.833 --> 34:51.917
I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT...

34:53.583 --> 34:54.667
I NEED RESPECT.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.667
I RESPECT YOU!

34:57.667 --> 34:59.458
I KNOW YOU RESPECT ME,
AND I LOVE YOU FOR IT,

34:59.458 --> 35:01.083
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.500
I NEED RESPECT OUT THERE.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.125
AND MAYBE I GOTTA
TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH

35:05.125 --> 35:07.417
THAN I THOUGHT
I WAS GOING TO,

35:07.417 --> 35:08.417
BUT C'EST LA VIE.

35:10.417 --> 35:12.750
THE ONLY THING I KNOW
FOR SURE RIGHT NOW...

35:12.750 --> 35:14.083
IS I NEED SLEEP!

35:14.083 --> 35:16.208
MMM.
MM-HMM.

35:16.208 --> 35:17.834
SO IF YOU AND I
GO HOME RIGHT NOW,

35:17.834 --> 35:18.792
WE WILL SLEEP, RIGHT?

35:18.792 --> 35:22.291
WE CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

35:23.041 --> 35:25.250
IS IT ALWAYS
GONNA BE LIKE THIS?

35:26.708 --> 35:28.000
I DON'T KNOW.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.458
I CAN'T TELL.

35:36.542 --> 35:38.625
COME ON.

35:40.542 --> 35:42.500
NOW, WE'RE NOT TALKIN'
IMMEDIATE SLEEP HERE,

35:42.500 --> 35:44.792
ARE WE, BABY?
NO.

35:44.792 --> 35:46.000
GOOD!

35:47.083 --> 35:48.333
(BOTH LAUGH)

35:50.500 --> 35:51.500
UHH!

35:51.500 --> 35:52.917
JO.

35:52.917 --> 35:53.917
THANKS.
WE'RE OUTTA HERE.

35:53.917 --> 35:55.750
GOOD NIGHT.
BYE, GUYS.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.125
THAT'S YOUR SHARE.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.875
THANKS.

36:14.208 --> 36:15.834
LOOK, EDDIE,
ABOUT EARLIER--

36:15.834 --> 36:16.917
HEY, DON'T SWEAT IT.

36:22.125 --> 36:23.625
HEY, I DIDN'T
MISS ANYTHING BIG

36:23.625 --> 36:25.166
IN CLASS TODAY, DID I?

36:25.166 --> 36:27.166
I MEAN,
ASIDE FROM THE, UH,

36:27.166 --> 36:29.166
AFOREMENTIONED
E-MAIL THING?

36:29.166 --> 36:33.667
WHICH LED
TO THE AFOREWITNESSED
FREAK-OUT?

36:33.667 --> 36:34.875
NO.

36:36.208 --> 36:39.291
(SONG PLAYS ON JUKEBOX)

36:47.917 --> 36:49.917
MAN, I--I HATE THIS SONG.

36:53.750 --> 36:55.542
YEAH, ME, TOO.

37:04.750 --> 37:07.542
(THUD)

37:07.542 --> 37:08.834
(CHUCKLES)

37:08.834 --> 37:10.041
(THUD)

37:10.041 --> 37:11.708
(SONG STOPS)
THANK YOU.

37:23.083 --> 37:25.750
UH, THANKS FOR
DOING THE DISHES.

37:25.750 --> 37:27.041
OH, I THINK THAT WAS PACEY.

37:27.041 --> 37:27.792
I HEARD HIM GET UP

37:27.792 --> 37:29.708
SOMEWHERE AROUND
THE CRACK OF DAWN.

37:29.708 --> 37:32.375
WELL, HE CLEANS
AND HE LEAVES
BEFORE I WAKE UP.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.750
THAT'S MORE THAN
I CAN SAY FOR
MY LAST BOYFRIEND.

37:33.750 --> 37:36.458
(CHUCKLES)

37:36.458 --> 37:38.917
MAN, DO I NOT WANNA
GO TO CLASSES TODAY.

37:38.917 --> 37:40.792
WHY? I MEAN, ASIDE
FROM TYPICAL SLOTH?

37:40.792 --> 37:42.667
YEAH.

37:42.667 --> 37:44.417
AH, IT'S--
IT'S MY PROFESSOR.

37:44.417 --> 37:46.291
HE JUST...

37:46.291 --> 37:47.500
(SIGHS) NEVER MIND.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.125
NO, WHAT?

37:49.125 --> 37:51.166
WELL...

37:51.166 --> 37:52.667
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, WE--

37:52.667 --> 37:56.959
WE HAD THIS REALLY WEIRD
MOMENT YESTERDAY

37:56.959 --> 37:59.583
WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE
I WAS INTO HIM.

37:59.583 --> 38:00.917
WELL, DID IT SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE INTO HIM

38:00.917 --> 38:03.250
OR DO YOU REALLY
FANCY HIM?

38:03.250 --> 38:04.750
YEAH, I REALLY
FANCY HIM, OK,

38:04.750 --> 38:06.208
BUT I DON'T WANT HIM
TO KNOW THAT.

38:06.208 --> 38:08.458
(LAUGHS) WELL, MAYBE
HE WAS FLATTERED.

38:08.458 --> 38:10.083
UH, OR MAYBE
HE WAS...

38:10.083 --> 38:11.000
MARRIED?

38:11.000 --> 38:11.917
WELL, HE SHOULD
BE FLATTERED.

38:11.917 --> 38:13.834
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:13.834 --> 38:14.417
GIVE ME--GIVE ME
SOME OF THAT STUFF.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.417
YEAH...

38:18.417 --> 38:19.542
OK...

38:22.750 --> 38:24.458
OHH! GOD!
(GIGGLING)

38:24.458 --> 38:26.417
THIS STUFF IS HORRIBLE!
(LAUGHING)

38:26.417 --> 38:27.834
YES, I KNOW!
HOW DO YOU DRINK THIS CRAP?

38:27.834 --> 38:28.375
WELL...

38:28.375 --> 38:30.041
COME ON...
YEAH, COME--

38:30.041 --> 38:31.625
AAH!

38:31.625 --> 38:33.333
(LAUGHING)

38:49.458 --> 38:50.708
GOOD MORNING.

38:51.083 --> 38:53.166
GOOD MORNING.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.250
OH, SORRY!

39:25.834 --> 39:27.333
OH, IT'S SO NICE
TO SEE YOU, POTTER.

39:27.333 --> 39:28.959
HOPE OUR PESKY CLASS
DIDN'T INTERFERE

39:28.959 --> 39:31.041
WITH YOUR ALL-IMPORTANT
E-MAIL SCHEDULE.

39:31.041 --> 39:33.542
WHIP OUT ANOTHER DIATRIBE
LAST NIGHT?

39:33.542 --> 39:35.500
(CLASS LAUGHS)

39:35.500 --> 39:36.792
ACTUALLY, I DID.

39:36.792 --> 39:37.333
I WAS HOPING
THIS WAS IT.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.917
DID YOU GUYS
NOT GET IT?

39:39.917 --> 39:41.917
OH, THIS IS ACTUALLY A COPY

39:41.917 --> 39:43.542
OF THE ARTICLE THAT I ASSIGNED
TO FOLLOW UP THE READING.

39:43.542 --> 39:47.041
I KNOW YOUR MINI-DRAMA
PROBABLY PREVENTED YOU

39:47.041 --> 39:50.166
FROM EVEN LOOKING
AT THE SYLLABUS.

39:51.792 --> 39:53.458
WELL, MOST
OF YESTERDAY CONSISTED

39:53.458 --> 39:55.500
OF EVISCERATING
MY PERSONAL LIFE,

39:55.500 --> 39:58.375
AND EVERY OTHER LESSON
IS A RANT COMPOSED
OF YOUR DATED THEORIES.

39:58.375 --> 40:00.708
I'M SORRY I'M LATE,
PROFESSOR HETSON,

40:00.708 --> 40:02.542
BUT THE FIRST HALF
OF CLASS IS USUALLY

40:02.542 --> 40:04.166
WHEN YOU REVEAL
HOW BITTER YOU ARE,

40:04.166 --> 40:05.333
HOW MORONIC WE ARE,

40:05.333 --> 40:07.250
AND HOW LITERATURE IS DEAD.

40:07.250 --> 40:09.041
WERE YOU THINKING
OF MOVING ON

40:09.041 --> 40:11.333
TO SOMETHING SLIGHTLY
MORE STIMULATING TODAY?

40:15.875 --> 40:18.083
WELL, I--

40:18.083 --> 40:19.750
I THINK WE'VE BEEN
SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME
TOGETHER, POTTER,

40:19.750 --> 40:20.750
IF THAT'S YOUR ATTITUDE.

40:20.750 --> 40:21.667
I MEAN, I WAS THINKING
OF TEACHING TODAY,

40:21.667 --> 40:23.959
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I'VE GOT A LOT TO OFFER,

40:23.959 --> 40:26.333
WHAT WITH THE TENURE
AND THE PUBLISHED ARTICLES
AND ALL.

40:26.333 --> 40:29.125
BUT IF YOU ALL INSIST
ON BEING STIMULATED,

40:29.125 --> 40:31.583
WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS
JAMES JOYCE'S DESCRIPTION

40:31.583 --> 40:33.000
OF THE GIRL ON THE BEACH.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.917
I MEAN, I'M TOO HACKNEYED
TO ILLUMINATE THE SUBJECT,

40:35.917 --> 40:38.208
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN
SHED SOME LIGHT.

40:38.959 --> 40:42.291
WILSON...

40:42.291 --> 40:43.750
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

41:33.625 --> 41:35.000
Man: LEERY!

41:35.000 --> 41:36.875
COME ON, BREAK'S OVER!
