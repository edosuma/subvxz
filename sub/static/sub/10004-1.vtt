Hey, who left the goddamn
front door open?

03:12.234 --> 03:14.020
Oh, by the way, how come I

03:14.236 --> 03:15.522
was the only one there
working tonight?

03:15.946 --> 03:17.607
We were there this afternoon,
Barb.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.646
A likely story.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.075
- How's it look?
- Yule-ish, very yule-ish.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.068
Have you got your
Santa Claus suit ready?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.575
Yeah. What time
the little bastards arrive?

03:28.083 --> 03:30.245
- At one o'clock.
- Terrific!

03:34.339 --> 03:35.500
Hello?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.711
Pardon?

03:38.385 --> 03:39.170
Who?

03:41.179 --> 03:43.261
Barb, it's for you.
Long distance.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.886
Oh, great. Hang on,
I'll take it in the other room.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.083
Could you guys shut up in there?
I can't hear a damn thing!

04:21.720 --> 04:22.801
Hello?

04:24.473 --> 04:26.259
Mom, hang on, I can't hear you.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.642
Operator, I can't hear…

04:30.854 --> 04:31.969
what's coming
from the other end.

04:32.189 --> 04:35.056
Can you…?
Yeah. All right, let's see.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.604
<i>Party's over!
Come on, all the men out!</i>

04:38.320 --> 04:41.062
<i>Come on! Bye-bye!</i>

04:41.865 --> 04:44.402
<i>No, operator,
I still can't hear anything.</i>

04:49.039 --> 04:50.871
<i>Hi, Mommy!
I can hear you now.</i>

04:51.208 --> 04:53.040
No, we're just having
a little party.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.831
No, I've had a couple.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.916
<i>Oh. come on, I'm not drunk.</i>

05:01.760 --> 05:04.923
<i>No, no. Um, I have some stuff
to do in the afternoon,</i>

05:05.305 --> 05:08.548
<i>and then I was just gonna
get the seven twenty train</i>

05:08.725 --> 05:09.635
<i>into the city.</i>

05:11.770 --> 05:12.976
<i>Goodnight! Bye!</i>

05:18.777 --> 05:20.267
Oh, come on.
You got to be kidding!

05:26.785 --> 05:28.196
Why can't I come, too?

05:30.831 --> 05:31.946
<i>Well, who the hell is he?</i>

05:32.165 --> 05:33.451
Good night.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.542
<i>You're a real
gold-plated whore, Mother,</i>

05:37.754 --> 05:38.539
- You know that?
- See you next week.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.540
Okay.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.167
Hey, call before you come.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.040
I'm gonna have to
get my parents used to that.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.671
<i>I'll just get a couple
of my friends</i>

05:44.886 --> 05:46.627
<i>and we'll go, uh, skiing.</i>

05:47.973 --> 05:50.180
- Goodnight! Bye!
- Yeah, sure. I'll be fine.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.095
I'll see you around.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.844
<i>Hey, Chris, wait up!
I'll give you a ride.</i>

05:59.734 --> 06:01.145
<i>Put the Christmas music back on.</i>

06:10.579 --> 06:12.866
Anyone want to go skiing
for a few days?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.416
Yeah, sure, Barb.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.953
My mother's taking a place up
at Mount Holly's.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.082
Anyone else want to come?

06:22.299 --> 06:24.961
- Yeah, sounds like fun.
- Great.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.666
How 'bout you, Clare?

06:26.845 --> 06:29.507
Uh, no thanks, Barb.
I've made some another plans.

06:33.852 --> 06:34.683
I'll get it.

06:44.696 --> 06:45.652
Hello?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.401
Hello?

06:49.659 --> 06:50.569
Hello?

06:52.579 --> 06:53.694
Hey, quiet!

06:53.914 --> 06:56.030
It's him again!
The moaner!

07:23.526 --> 07:24.891
He's expanded his act.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.194
Could that be one person?

07:27.530 --> 07:30.022
No, Clare, that's
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir

07:30.200 --> 07:31.782
doing their annual
obscene phone call.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.165
<i>Let me lick it!</i>

07:41.419 --> 07:43.251
<i>Let me stick my tongue on it
and lick it!</i>

07:57.185 --> 07:59.051
<i>You…</i>

07:59.479 --> 08:00.469
<i>You pig cunt!</i>

08:01.314 --> 08:04.432
<i>Yeah, you pig cunt!
You pig cunt!</i>

08:05.026 --> 08:08.815
<i>Let me lick it! Lick it!</i>

08:09.114 --> 08:10.650
<i>Lick it!</i>

08:10.907 --> 08:13.990
<i>Let me lick your
pretty piggy cunt!</i>

08:19.916 --> 08:24.205
<i>Pretty pig cunt!</i>

08:24.671 --> 08:27.163
<i>I'll lick your pretty pig clit.
I'm like a tuna farm, baby!</i>

08:27.424 --> 08:28.334
Mmm, not bad.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.258
<i>Suck on my juicy cock!</i>

08:31.678 --> 08:32.793
<i>I'll come over.</i>

08:33.263 --> 08:36.722
<i>I'll come over and you can…
You can suck it. Suck it! Okay?</i>

08:36.933 --> 08:37.638
Listen, you pervert!

08:37.851 --> 08:38.966
Why don't you
go over to Lambda Chi?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.558
They could use a little of this.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.807
<i>You piggy cunt,</i>

08:43.523 --> 08:45.230
<i>you want my fat cock.</i>

08:45.525 --> 08:47.482
Oh, why don't you
go find a wall socket

08:47.694 --> 08:49.981
and stick your tongue in it,
that'll give you a charge.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.107
<i>I'll stick my tongue up
your pretty pussy!</i>

08:52.282 --> 08:54.148
You fucking creep!

08:54.743 --> 08:56.074
<i>I'm going to kill you.</i>

09:07.338 --> 09:09.204
Well, Super Tongue
strikes again.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.127
Fastest tongue in the west.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.921
That was sick!

09:13.303 --> 09:14.668
I really don't think you
should provoke

09:14.888 --> 09:16.174
somebody like that, Barb.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.879
Oh, listen, this guy's
minor league.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.260
In the city,
I get two of those a day.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.341
Maybe.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.347
But you know that town girl was
raped a couple of weeks ago.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.054
Darling…

09:25.565 --> 09:27.681
you can't rape a Townie!

09:28.193 --> 09:30.275
You really are too much, Barb.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.277
Oh, come on, this is
a sorority house,

09:32.489 --> 09:33.399
not a convent!

09:34.991 --> 09:36.902
I'll see ya later.
I'm gonna go pack.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.156
Come on, Clare.
She didn't mean anything.

09:44.626 --> 09:48.290
No, really Jess, it's okay.
I have to finish packing anyway.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.131
Hasn't she had enough trouble
fitting in here without you

09:53.384 --> 09:54.590
getting at her all the time?

09:54.761 --> 09:55.501
Come on.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.793
I know a professional virgin
when I see one!

09:57.138 --> 09:59.300
Hey, can I get a hand out here?

09:59.682 --> 10:01.719
Speaking of
professional virgins…

10:01.935 --> 10:05.144
Here we have the Queen
of Vaudeville circa 1891.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.933
Where have you been?

10:08.149 --> 10:08.980
I've been shopping.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.273
You know how big the store is

10:10.443 --> 10:12.605
and how spectacular it is
this time of year.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.357
I never saw such a bunch ofjunk!

10:14.572 --> 10:15.482
Mrs. Mac,
come in the other room!

10:15.698 --> 10:16.859
We've got a surprise for you!

10:22.497 --> 10:24.079
There you are.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.040
Where have you been?

10:28.503 --> 10:30.790
Mrs. Mac's been looking
all over for you.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.622
Oh, little puss! Hello.

10:33.842 --> 10:34.673
Go on, now!

10:35.051 --> 10:36.541
Got some things to do.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.673
Oh, let's see.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.718
Claude?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.516
Is that you, puss?

11:27.437 --> 11:28.347
Kitty?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.435
Who is that?

11:34.903 --> 11:36.359
Who is it?

11:38.239 --> 11:39.354
Claude?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.870
Who is that?

11:52.670 --> 11:53.660
Who is it?

12:00.678 --> 12:01.918
Oh, girls…

12:02.138 --> 12:03.674
it's really beautiful.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.175
It's gorgeous and the color
and everything.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.680
No, it's really lovely.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.354
I've got about as much use
for this as a chastity belt!

12:13.483 --> 12:15.770
Aw, come on, Mrs. Mac,
put it on.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.066
Put it on?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.399
Oh, come on,
I'm not going to bed!

12:20.198 --> 12:21.563
Come on, please.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.569
Yeah, put it on!

12:24.786 --> 12:25.992
Put it on.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.783
Anything for you girls,
because it's Christmas.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.326
Hey, you bet!

12:49.435 --> 12:51.676
<i>Okay, girls, party's over.</i>

12:51.896 --> 12:53.807
<i>Let's get this junk cleaned up.
Oh?</i>

12:54.274 --> 12:55.230
<i>Oh yeah, come on.</i>

12:55.400 --> 12:56.515
<i>Everybody takes
a little something,</i>

12:56.734 --> 12:57.519
<i>it won't take long.</i>

12:59.237 --> 13:02.480
<i>Come on girls,
just a little cooperation.</i>

13:07.120 --> 13:09.407
Let's just get you up,
'cause you're tired.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.950
You really are!

13:11.624 --> 13:12.580
Good night.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.459
Before…

13:23.970 --> 13:25.586
booze.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.391
There you are.

13:46.909 --> 13:51.824
<i>Good night, good night.
Merry Christmas!</i>

13:58.338 --> 14:02.582
Jess, you girls are just
too good to me.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.420
Oh, nonsense, Mrs. Mac.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.275
Hello?

14:22.445 --> 14:23.526
<i>Hello, is Jess there, please?</i>

14:24.113 --> 14:25.274
Yeah, wait a second, Peter.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.447
Jess, it's for you. It's him.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.409
Hello?

14:31.662 --> 14:32.993
<i>Hi, how's the party?</i>

14:33.331 --> 14:35.663
Oh, it was good.
Too bad you couldn't make it.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.706
<i>I've been…
I've been practicing</i>

14:36.918 --> 14:38.750
<i>for four days straight.
I am really, really wiped out.</i>

14:38.920 --> 14:39.705
Yes, I know.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.619
Jess, clear…

14:40.838 --> 14:42.545
You won't forget
to put out the lights?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.166
You've got to find some time.
I've gotta talk to you.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.382
<i>You sound funny.
What's the matter?</i>

14:50.640 --> 14:53.678
Nothing's the matter.
I just wanna talk to you.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.808
<i>Why don't you tell me now?</i>

14:56.979 --> 14:59.220
Because I wanna talk to you,
face to face.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.186
<i>Jess, I haven't been
to bed in three nights.</i>

15:02.360 --> 15:04.647
<i>I'm just not the mood
to be playing games.</i>

15:05.071 --> 15:07.563
Look, Peter, we'll talk about it
tomorrow, okay?

15:08.533 --> 15:11.241
<i>Okay. I'll be in
Room 30, all day.</i>

15:11.702 --> 15:14.034
All right, I'll see you
around two.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.196
<i>I didn't mean
to sound short with you.</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:18.282
<i>I… I guess I'm
just exhausted, okay?</i>

15:18.543 --> 15:19.874
Yeah, it's okay.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.042
<i>I love you.</i>

15:21.796 --> 15:22.831
I know.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.083
See you tomorrow.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.170
<i>Yeah, well, good night.</i>

16:21.230 --> 16:24.018
Jesus, I wouldn't wear this to
have my liver out!

16:34.285 --> 16:35.446
Clare?

16:37.246 --> 16:38.611
Clare?

16:53.095 --> 16:56.508
<i>♪ Little baby Bunting' ♪</i>

16:56.807 --> 16:59.970
<i>♪ Daddy's gone a-huntin" ♪</i>

17:00.311 --> 17:03.770

17:04.190 --> 17:08.525
<i>♪ To wrap his baby Agnes in ♪</i>

18:06.294 --> 18:07.830
- Oh, thank you.
- That's okay.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.085
I'm sorry. I should have
been keeping a better watch

18:09.297 --> 18:10.002
on them.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.249
I think so.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.918
Yeah, well, I said I was sorry.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.584
Excuse me?

18:18.014 --> 18:19.846
I hate to bother you.
I can see that you're busy.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.639
But I wonder if you
could help me.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.142
You see, I was supposed
to meet my daughter here

18:24.353 --> 18:25.058
at one o'clock.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.354
It's… it's half past now,
and she's still not here.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.773
Her name's Clare Harrison.
Do you know her?

18:31.319 --> 18:32.525
Clare Harrison?

18:33.904 --> 18:35.065
Yeah, I think so.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.025
I know she lives
in a sorority house.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.564
It's… it's called, um…

18:39.493 --> 18:42.360
Pi, uh, Kappa Sig…

18:42.580 --> 18:44.821
Ch, of course! Yeah, well,
Kappa's our sister sorority.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.206
Uh, some of the girls are
over here today,

18:47.418 --> 18:48.874
but I haven't seen Clare.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.795
Uh, the place isn't far.
I'll tell you how to get there.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.585
Ho, ho, ho, shit!

18:56.636 --> 18:58.547
Santa! Please.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.086
Look, she's supposed
to be going away with me

19:00.348 --> 19:01.383
for the weekend, goddammit.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.674
Well, we decided that we would
go skiing for a few days.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.597
Yeah, and I've
been looking forward to this

19:06.812 --> 19:09.053
for three weeks. Bitch!

19:09.440 --> 19:10.726
Isn't Santa naughty?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.391
Ho, ho, ho, fuck.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.652
<i>I just don't know,
Mr. Harrison.</i>

19:16.906 --> 19:18.897
<i>Her clothes are all packed
and ready to go.</i>

19:19.909 --> 19:21.991
<i>I'll bet you'll find her
over at the common room.</i>

19:22.161 --> 19:23.617
<i>They're having
a party there today</i>

19:23.829 --> 19:25.570
<i>for underprivileged children.</i>

19:36.050 --> 19:37.461
Yes, I know.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.805
I'm very disappointed
in this atmosphere,

19:45.142 --> 19:46.883
and I intend to do
something about it.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.850
Who's this?

19:53.359 --> 19:56.101
Um, uh, that's, uh,
a friend of Clare's,

19:56.278 --> 19:58.019
a very nice young man
from the town.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.479
Uh, Chris Hayden.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.871
I didn't send my daughter here
to be drinking and…

20:10.292 --> 20:11.532
…picking up boys.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.160
Oh, Clare is a good girl,
Mr. Harrison.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.462
I wouldn't want you to
get the wrong idea about that.

20:16.674 --> 20:17.880
She is a good girl.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.259
I'm sure you'll find her
at the fraternity house.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.878
As a matter of fact,
I could show you the way.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.509
I-I have to go to a store
near there.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.765
If you wouldn't mind
giving me a lift.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.721
I know where it is.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.645
But I'll be glad
to give you a ride.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.820
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Harrison.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.903
I'll just get my bag.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.796
"I didn't send my daughter here
to be drinking

21:02.011 --> 21:03.968
and picking up boys."

21:05.431 --> 21:07.263
Tough shit!

21:08.851 --> 21:11.058
Am I supposed
to be responsible…

21:12.313 --> 21:15.396
for the morals of every girl
in this goddamn house.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.524
These broads would hump
the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

21:21.739 --> 21:23.195
if they could get up there.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.107
I do my best.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.949
I don't know what the bastards
expect of me.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.116
Christ's sake!

21:34.877 --> 21:36.117
Claude?

21:38.047 --> 21:40.038
Is that you, Claudekins?

21:40.466 --> 21:41.672
Claude?

21:43.260 --> 21:45.251
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty!

21:46.806 --> 21:49.639
Come on, Claude.
Come say goodbye to Mommy!

21:51.519 --> 21:53.135
Is that you, Claude?

21:53.354 --> 21:54.890
Oh, Jesus!

21:55.147 --> 21:57.058
Claude, look what you
made me do!

22:01.028 --> 22:02.189
Come on, Claude!

22:02.363 --> 22:04.980
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty!

22:05.616 --> 22:07.948
Come on, Claude!
I gotta go!

22:08.828 --> 22:10.535
Here, kitty!

22:11.080 --> 22:13.788
Oh, goddammit, Claude!
You little prick!

22:19.380 --> 22:22.748
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Harrison.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.467
Think nothing of it.

22:45.573 --> 22:49.487
♫

22:58.210 --> 22:59.575
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

23:01.046 --> 23:02.127
<i>What?</i>

23:03.507 --> 23:04.588
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

23:05.384 --> 23:07.546
<i>God, Jess, that's fantastic!</i>

23:08.345 --> 23:09.676
I don't want it.

23:11.807 --> 23:12.888
You don't want it?

23:13.642 --> 23:14.598
No.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.177
I want to have an abortion.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.850
You can't make a decision
like that.

23:21.108 --> 23:21.939
You haven't even asked me.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.682
I wasn't even gonna tell you.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.151
Jess.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.940
I want us to have a baby.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.994
- Peter, I can't!
- Oh, Christ, Jess.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.631
Don't you ever consider
anyone but yourself?

23:51.388 --> 23:53.345
I've thought this out
very carefully,

23:53.557 --> 23:55.264
and I know what I'm gonna do.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.264
Do you know how important this
afternoon is to me?

24:01.482 --> 24:02.688
Yes, I do.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.273
Why don't you just
get out of here.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.620
Jess!

24:25.130 --> 24:26.370
I want to talk to you tonight.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.623
There's nothing to discuss,
Peter!

24:28.801 --> 24:29.586
I think there is!

24:30.094 --> 24:31.630
I'm not gonna change my mind!

24:31.845 --> 24:32.630
We'll see.

24:33.347 --> 24:34.587
Will you be there
at nine o'clock?

24:34.807 --> 24:35.592
Yes.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.389
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.349
Yes, dear.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.481
I'm sure there's nothing wrong.

24:46.527 --> 24:49.269
Yes, I've just been talking
with a friend of hers.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.612
She's going to call around
for me.

24:51.865 --> 24:52.855
Here, need some more, huh?

24:53.534 --> 24:56.492
Yes, well, if we don't have
any luck, I'll go to the police.

24:57.871 --> 24:58.861
Yes.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.990
Well, I don't think I'll be
home tonight.

25:02.543 --> 25:03.783
It's a bit late to head out now.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.543
I think the lil' bugger's
schnockered,

25:05.754 --> 25:06.789
son of a bitch.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.339
- Eh, Shortie?
- Yeah, goodbye, dear.

25:10.551 --> 25:11.666
You are, aren't ya?

25:23.397 --> 25:24.603
Hello?

25:25.190 --> 25:26.305
Hello?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.523
Hello?

25:28.819 --> 25:30.605
Oh hell, not again!

25:30.863 --> 25:32.194
<i>Billy!</i>

25:33.240 --> 25:34.571
Billy?

25:34.825 --> 25:36.441
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong number.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.531
<i>What your mother
and I must know is…</i>

25:40.539 --> 25:42.155
<i>Where did you put the baby?</i>

25:42.458 --> 25:43.914
You've got the wrong number.

25:44.418 --> 25:47.035
<i>Where did you put Agnes, Billy?</i>

25:48.547 --> 25:50.754
Look, I'm telling you,
you have the wrong number!

25:51.175 --> 25:53.963
<i>What your mother
and I must know is"</i>

25:54.595 --> 25:55.460
<i>Billy!</i>

26:09.777 --> 26:11.643
<i>You guys can never
get it together with a…</i>

26:11.904 --> 26:12.609
<i>Look, I really don't think</i>

26:12.905 --> 26:13.645
<i>you're taking this as seriously</i>

26:13.906 --> 26:15.067
<i>as you should.
I mean, honestly.</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:16.571
<i>We may hear
a non specific…</i>

26:16.825 --> 26:19.908
Hold it, hold it!
Jesus!

26:20.287 --> 26:22.198
Could you just give it
to me one at a time?

26:22.414 --> 26:24.906
Well, what the hell are you
planning to do about it?

26:25.959 --> 26:28.792
You… shut up!

26:29.755 --> 26:31.371
You know, for a public servant,

26:31.590 --> 26:33.547
I think your attitude
really sucks.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.256
Shut up.

26:40.474 --> 26:41.635
Now, Mr. Harrison,

26:42.059 --> 26:43.720
if you're convinced
your daughter is missing,

26:43.936 --> 26:45.643
you can fill out one
of these forms.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.230
I don't know if it's
any consolation,

26:49.399 --> 26:50.560
but 90 percent of the time

26:50.776 --> 26:52.608
girls who are reported missing
from the college,

26:52.820 --> 26:54.527
they're at a cabin somewhere,
with a boyfriend.

26:55.072 --> 26:58.565
Thanks, but that's not much
consolation.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.284
Oh, here, Mrs. Mac,
let me help.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.323
Thank you, dear.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.243
You know, we got to
get Mr. Reynolds

27:06.458 --> 27:07.493
to fix this door.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.701
I must have called that
son of a bitch

27:09.920 --> 27:11.536
a hundred times about it.

27:14.842 --> 27:15.673
<i>Oh, Mrs. Mac,</i>

27:15.926 --> 27:18.088
<i>there was another one
of those calls just now.</i>

27:19.179 --> 27:20.715
Oh, was there, dear?

27:21.640 --> 27:22.425
<i>It was weird!</i>

27:22.599 --> 27:25.182
<i>Some woman screaming,
then a man wailing.</i>

27:25.686 --> 27:28.394
Uh, Clare Harrison's father
was here today.

27:28.605 --> 27:29.390
<i>Oh, really?</i>

27:29.565 --> 27:31.681
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
get to say goodbye to her.</i>

27:32.234 --> 27:33.816
Well, you still might.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.231
Clare didn't meet him where she
was supposed to.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.192
Uh, I thought she went over
to the fraternity.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.485
Where is it?

27:44.872 --> 27:46.328
Eureka!

27:54.423 --> 27:55.754
Excuse me.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.591
Could you give me the number
of the sorority house?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.002
Please.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.631
Yeah, sure.

28:06.602 --> 28:07.933
It's, uh…

28:09.313 --> 28:13.307
Fellatio… 2-0-8-8-0.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.059
What?

28:17.988 --> 28:19.194
Fellatio.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.780
It… It's a…
It's a new exchange.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.403
I'FI'_'IEI'-.

28:23.744 --> 28:24.950
That's a new one on me.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.695
How do you spell it?

28:29.666 --> 28:31.873
Capital 'F', 'E',

28:32.544 --> 28:34.581
little 'I', 'I',

28:34.796 --> 28:36.082
IAI, UT', II', IO.-

28:38.592 --> 28:39.548
Thanks.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.591
Don't mention it.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.194
Chris!

29:08.789 --> 29:09.699
Hi, what's up?

29:10.165 --> 29:12.907
- Have you seen Clare today?
- No, she went home.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.242
No she didn't.
No one knows where she is.

29:16.797 --> 29:17.662
Are you serious?

29:18.340 --> 29:19.626
I thought maybe she was with you

29:19.800 --> 29:21.461
or at least you might have
heard from her.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.050
No, not since last night.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.086
Well, her father came
to pick her up

29:26.348 --> 29:28.055
at 1 o'clock today,
and she didn't show.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.845
So he went down
to the police station

29:31.103 --> 29:31.968
with Phyl and Barb.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.182
What happened?

29:35.065 --> 29:37.602
- They didn't take It urlously.
- Why?

29:38.610 --> 29:39.725
I don't know.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.066
I think they figured she
was shacked up somewhere.

30:54.144 --> 30:58.604
Well, um, she's out
for Christmas holidays, but…

30:59.274 --> 31:01.766
there was a band practice
over at the high school

31:02.027 --> 31:02.687
this afternoon,

31:02.944 --> 31:06.858
and… Janice plays
the clarinet,

31:08.367 --> 31:11.359
and, uh, when she
didn't come home,

31:11.578 --> 31:15.697
I-I thought Melody Green,
that's her… best friend.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.661
And, uh, they hadn't
seen her all day.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.873
She's only 13 years old,
Lieutenant,

31:22.089 --> 31:26.629
and… my husband's a trucker,
he's out on the road,

31:26.802 --> 31:28.292
and so I came over here.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.801
Yeah, well, is it really
so unusual

31:30.013 --> 31:32.254
for her to be just a
few hours late, Mrs. Quaife?

31:32.599 --> 31:34.715
Oh, yes. She should have
been home at noon.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.926
We were gonna buy a present
for her father.

31:38.730 --> 31:42.519
Nash, you stupid son of a bitch,
you got a big goddamn mouth!

31:43.443 --> 31:44.399
What the hell are you
talking about?

31:44.611 --> 31:46.101
<i>Hi Chris, how's your brother?</i>

31:47.072 --> 31:48.358
Ken, I gotta talk to you.

31:48.532 --> 31:49.488
What's up?

31:49.699 --> 31:51.064
I want to know why
nothing's being done

31:51.243 --> 31:52.404
about Clare Harrison
being missing,

31:52.619 --> 31:55.077
and why this… idiot
gets away with saying

31:55.288 --> 31:56.198
the things he does?

31:58.250 --> 31:59.866
You're a friend
of Clare Harrison?

32:00.085 --> 32:01.496
Yeah, I've been taking her out.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.710
Oh, this is Jess, Ken.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.913
She lives in the same
sorority house as Clare.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.040
All right, come on in.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.584
Sergeant, bring me the file
on the Harrison girl.

32:11.847 --> 32:12.837
And take care of this.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.481
At least you should try
to eat something, Mr. Harrison.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.437
You know, starving yourself
isn't going to help

32:26.653 --> 32:27.518
the situation at all.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.066
No, thank you very much,
Mrs. MacHenry,

32:30.240 --> 32:31.947
but I just have no appetite.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.487
I feel I should be
doing something,

32:34.828 --> 32:35.909
but I don't know what.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.078
Well, why don't you
just try to stop worrying?

32:38.457 --> 32:40.243
The best thing you can do is
stay right here.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.536
I'm sure she'll call
or show up soon.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.292
If I just knew what to do.

32:45.338 --> 32:48.672
Did you know…
it's a very little known fact,

32:48.842 --> 32:50.674
but… did you know that

32:50.844 --> 32:52.755
there is a certain species
of turtle…

32:56.933 --> 32:59.925
there's a certain species
of turtle…

33:01.480 --> 33:05.098
that can screw for three days
without stopping.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.938
You don't believe me, do you?

33:09.279 --> 33:12.192
Well, I mean how could I
make something like that up?

33:13.033 --> 33:17.823
Uh, Barb, dear, I… I… I…

33:18.079 --> 33:20.946
No, really, they just
three days, 24 hours a day.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.664
Whoomp!
Whoomp!

33:23.376 --> 33:26.038
Can you believe that?
Three days?

33:26.588 --> 33:28.704
I'm lucky if I get
three minutes.

33:29.591 --> 33:30.956
Do you know how I know this?

33:31.343 --> 33:36.213
Because I went down
to the zoo, and I watched them.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.381
It was very boring.

33:40.477 --> 33:44.061
Well, actually, um, I,
uh, didn't stay

33:44.272 --> 33:45.603
for the whole three days.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.311
I went over and I
watched the zebras,

33:48.485 --> 33:51.603
because they
only take 30 seconds.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.772
Premature ejaculation!

34:13.717 --> 34:15.333
You think it's my fault,
don't you?

34:16.679 --> 34:17.920
Barb, stop it!

34:18.139 --> 34:19.094
Don't shit me!

34:19.683 --> 34:20.889
It's what you're all thinking.

34:21.141 --> 34:22.678
Why don't you just
come right out and say it?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.136
You think that I
drove her away…

34:25.855 --> 34:28.266
and if she's dead,
you're gonna blame me.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.896
Barb, for God's sake!

34:33.989 --> 34:35.445
Well, that's what
we're all thinking

34:35.657 --> 34:37.398
why doesn't someone
just come right out and say it?

34:37.742 --> 34:39.152
Barb, dear, you've
had too much to drink.

34:39.369 --> 34:40.074
Mr. Harrison…

34:40.286 --> 34:42.277
I don't give a shit
about Mr. Harrison!

34:42.496 --> 34:44.829
I'm sick and tired of everyone
in this house insinuating stuff

34:45.000 --> 34:46.581
and not coming out with
what they mean.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.830
Barb, why don't you go upstairs
and lie down for a while?

34:49.045 --> 34:49.750
Shut up!

34:49.920 --> 34:52.458
And you leave me alone,
goddamn you!

34:52.799 --> 34:54.039
You think it's my fault,
don't you?

34:54.259 --> 34:55.545
You've been implying it
all afternoon!

34:55.719 --> 34:57.585
Barb, you're drunk!

34:58.680 --> 34:59.920
Go to bed!

35:10.734 --> 35:12.520
Yeah, sure. Fine.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.195
- Any news?
- Yes! Where's Mr. Harrison?

35:58.406 --> 36:00.272
Uh, he-he's in the dining room.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.305
- We won't be long, Mrs. Mac.
- All right, dear.

36:33.483 --> 36:34.223
See you later.

36:34.401 --> 36:36.142
- Uh, Phyl,
- Yeah?

36:36.319 --> 36:37.730
Phyl, listen, I'm sure Clare
will be all right.

36:37.987 --> 36:38.647
I hope so.

36:38.905 --> 36:39.861
And I just want to tell you that

36:40.073 --> 36:41.939
I'm going to go to my sister's
for the holiday…

36:42.158 --> 36:44.320
…so I might not be here
when you get back.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.277
That's okay. Look, just check in
on Barb before you leave,

36:46.496 --> 36:47.201
could you do that?

36:47.414 --> 36:48.654
Of course, I will.
And you bundle up.

36:48.873 --> 36:49.954
We'll be all right, Mrs. Mac.

36:50.792 --> 36:51.748
<i>Mrs. Quaife…</i>

36:52.711 --> 36:56.796
<i>and Mr. Harrison have asked me
to extend their thanks to you</i>

36:56.965 --> 36:58.956
<i>for coming out on this
cold night to help.</i>

37:00.427 --> 37:04.261
<i>Now, Mrs. Quaife has told us
that Janice most likely</i>

37:04.472 --> 37:05.633
<i>came through this park…</i>

37:06.015 --> 37:08.507
<i>on her way home
from school today.</i>

37:09.394 --> 37:11.886
<i>So, the first thing we'll do
is comb the park.</i>

37:13.440 --> 37:14.555
<i>When I tell you,</i>

37:15.525 --> 37:18.187
<i>I want you all to assemble
on the south edge of the park</i>

37:18.403 --> 37:19.609
<i>with your assigned officer.</i>

37:20.947 --> 37:23.484
<i>Then, we'll just walk through
the park. Spread out evenly!</i>

37:24.033 --> 37:24.773
<i>Don't bunch up.</i>

37:24.993 --> 37:27.781
<i>There'll be two sets of dogs
leading the way.</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:31.538
<i>Just spread out and follow them.</i>

37:32.751 --> 37:33.582
<i>George and Carly…</i>

37:34.669 --> 37:35.784
<i>stay out on the flanks.</i>

37:36.463 --> 37:37.624
<i>The fumes 'II mess up the dogs,</i>

37:37.839 --> 37:38.829
<i>and don't go more
than ten miles an hour.</i>

37:39.048 --> 37:40.129
<i>Or you'll be no use to us.</i>

37:41.009 --> 37:43.671
<i>Now if any of you
find anything, I want you</i>

37:43.887 --> 37:46.595
<i>to send someone out immediately
to report it to me.</i>

37:48.099 --> 37:49.214
<i>Is that clear?</i>

37:50.560 --> 37:52.050
<i>Are there any questions?</i>

37:55.106 --> 37:56.346
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

38:28.056 --> 38:31.048
<i>♪ Alligators come through ♪
♪ the gate' ♪</i>

38:31.518 --> 38:34.636
<i>♪ But goodbye leg if ya ♪

38:36.064 --> 38:41.776

All right! I hear ya!

38:57.085 --> 38:58.541
Claude?

39:00.922 --> 39:01.957
Claude?

39:06.886 --> 39:08.593
Claude?

39:12.183 --> 39:13.548
Claude?

39:15.186 --> 39:16.426
Claude?

39:24.112 --> 39:25.648
Claude?

39:27.866 --> 39:29.732
Where are you?

39:42.505 --> 39:44.212
♫

39:50.430 --> 39:51.340
Claude?

40:03.443 --> 40:05.980
How did you get up
in the attic, Claude?

40:06.571 --> 40:08.153
Gee!

40:12.160 --> 40:14.822
All right! Goddammit!
You can wait!

40:21.002 --> 40:22.834
Claude, are you up here?

40:25.590 --> 40:28.298
Jesus Christ, I don't see
how you could be up here.

40:28.718 --> 40:29.879
Claude!

40:33.806 --> 40:35.137
Jesus, Claude!

40:35.350 --> 40:36.840
Now look at what you made me do!

40:42.941 --> 40:45.023
Oh, Jesus, I've
got to clean this place up

40:45.234 --> 40:46.269
one of these days.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.317
Claude!

40:48.863 --> 40:50.194
Claude?

40:51.074 --> 40:53.281
I can't see a damn thing.

40:54.577 --> 40:55.908
Claude?

40:57.705 --> 41:00.572
Goddammit, Claude!
I'm gonna have you fixed!

41:32.740 --> 41:34.401
Hey!

41:38.246 --> 41:39.702
Anybody there?

41:45.712 --> 41:47.168
Anybody there?

42:40.058 --> 42:41.173
I'm gonna have to split.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.099
Peter's coming around,
and I'm late already.

42:43.311 --> 42:46.053
- My God, it's cold.
- We'll coming home soon, too.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.471
- I'm freezing.
- Oh, God. Okay, see you.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.147
We'll let you know if
anything happens.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.980
♫

43:26.646 --> 43:28.853
- Is that my baby?
- Take it easy, Mrs. Quaife!

43:29.107 --> 43:30.393
Janice! Janice!

43:32.151 --> 43:34.609
<i>Janice! Janice, Janice!</i>

43:34.821 --> 43:38.439
<i>Janice! Janice! Janice!</i>

43:38.658 --> 43:39.773
<i>Janice!</i>

43:48.668 --> 43:50.329
Janice!

44:14.277 --> 44:15.392
Hello?

44:18.114 --> 44:19.479
Hello?

44:21.159 --> 44:22.194
Who is this?

44:23.119 --> 44:27.113
<i>Oh, help me!
Please, stop me!</i>

44:27.540 --> 44:31.875
<i>Oh, God, please!
Help me!</i>

44:33.796 --> 44:36.754
What do you want?
Why are you doing this?

44:38.968 --> 44:41.050
<i>Filthy Billy!</i>

44:46.976 --> 44:48.137
Who are you?

44:48.519 --> 44:50.430
For God's sake,
what are you doing?

44:50.771 --> 44:52.853
<i>I know what you did, Blllyl</i>

44:53.107 --> 44:54.188
<i>Stupid Billy!</i>

44:54.525 --> 44:57.438
<i>Billy! Billy! Mad!</i>

44:57.695 --> 44:58.901
Stop this!

45:04.202 --> 45:07.160
Oh, Jesus Christ! Mrs. Mac?

45:08.956 --> 45:10.572
Mrs. Mac, are you home?

45:11.834 --> 45:14.075
Mrs. Mac, are you up there?

45:55.962 --> 45:57.168
Yes, hello?

45:57.380 --> 45:59.587
Um, I've been
getting obscene phone calls,

45:59.799 --> 46:01.631
and I want to know what
can be done about it.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.751
Yes, all right. I'll hold,
but only for a moment.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.517
Peter, Jesus, you
scared the hell out of me!

46:13.729 --> 46:14.935
Why didn't you say something?

46:15.398 --> 46:17.685
Yeah? Well…

46:19.443 --> 46:21.434
you scared the hell out of me.
Too.

46:22.405 --> 46:23.816
What was all that yelling about?

46:24.740 --> 46:26.322
I was upstairs having
a little sleep.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.195
Hope you don't mind, but it
got a little cold out there

46:28.411 --> 46:29.151
waiting for you.

46:29.537 --> 46:31.949
- Sorry, I was late, Peter.
- Yeah.

46:33.207 --> 46:34.948
Clare Harrison is missing.

46:35.167 --> 46:37.033
I was out with the search party
looking for her.

46:37.753 --> 46:39.790
- Yes, hello?
- How noble.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.505
I want to report something.

46:43.009 --> 46:44.795
No, I don't want to hold!

46:46.846 --> 46:48.428
How did the recital go?

46:49.598 --> 46:50.929
How do you think it went?

46:53.185 --> 46:55.301
Peter, what kind
of a game are you playing?

46:56.147 --> 46:57.387
I thought you wanted to talk.

46:57.606 --> 46:59.096
So why don't you
quit attacking me

46:59.317 --> 47:01.729
and we try to have
a rational, adult conversation?

47:03.321 --> 47:05.813
Yes, now stay on the line!

47:06.240 --> 47:09.278
Okay! Now calm down, lady.
Let's have the story.

47:11.162 --> 47:14.154
Oh, yeah? What's the address?

47:15.666 --> 47:19.660
Six Belmont Street.
How many calls?

47:20.838 --> 47:22.454
Well, did you
call the phone company?

47:24.008 --> 47:24.793
Oh, yeah?

47:25.760 --> 47:27.342
Well, miss,
we're very busy here.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.043
There's been a child murdered
in the park.

47:32.016 --> 47:34.098
I don't know when we
can get them out on it.

47:34.477 --> 47:35.717
It's probably just one of your
boyfriends

47:35.936 --> 47:36.721
playing a little joke.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.100
Yeah. Well, I'll report it
and try to get a man on it

47:40.316 --> 47:41.477
just as soon as possible.

47:42.318 --> 47:43.854
I'm sorry, Miss.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.619
Jess, what's wrong?

47:57.541 --> 47:59.873
A little girl was found murdered
in the park.

48:00.920 --> 48:01.876
What?

48:02.838 --> 48:04.670
The search party that was
looking for Clare

48:04.882 --> 48:06.338
found a little girl murdered.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.545
And Clare's still missing.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.254
Look, Clare's all right.

48:14.308 --> 48:15.548
Is she?

48:18.687 --> 48:20.724
Now listen, Jess,
I know you're upset.

48:21.774 --> 48:23.890
But I've got something
to tell you.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.603
Mm-hmm.

48:26.570 --> 48:28.026
I'm leaving the conservatory.

48:28.697 --> 48:30.779
- Petor.
- Now, you just hear me out.

48:31.450 --> 48:33.066
Will you hear me out, please?

48:35.037 --> 48:37.278
Now, I've lived in one room
for eight years,

48:37.498 --> 48:38.488
and I'm tired of it.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.662
I'm tired of having to line up
behind six people

48:42.878 --> 48:44.994
every time I wanna take a bath.
I've had it.

48:47.633 --> 48:50.125
I'm quitting the conservatory,
and we're getting married.

48:57.143 --> 48:58.349
Well, say something.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.562
Do you remember when we
first met?

49:07.903 --> 49:10.941
You told me about your wanting
to be a concert pianist,

49:11.657 --> 49:13.739
how it was your greatest dream,

49:14.952 --> 49:17.068
and I told you about
some of the things that I

49:17.288 --> 49:18.153
wanted to do?

49:19.707 --> 49:21.698
I still want to do those things.

49:23.878 --> 49:25.243
You can't ask me
to drop everything

49:25.463 --> 49:26.419
I've been working for

49:26.630 --> 49:29.497
and give up all my ambitions,
because your plans have changed.

49:30.217 --> 49:33.130
Be realistic.
I can't marry you.

49:33.429 --> 49:34.260
<i>Sure you can.</i>

49:35.306 --> 49:36.592
<i>What does it change?</i>

49:37.850 --> 49:38.715
We could be married.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.641
You could still do anything you
wanted to do.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.223
Peter, I don't want
to marry you.

49:54.283 --> 49:55.694
All right.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.238
What about the baby?

49:59.205 --> 50:01.367
I didn't want to bother you
with it, sir.

50:01.874 --> 50:02.989
Well, you didn't.

50:04.376 --> 50:07.243
Six Belmont Street, that's
where your daughter lives?

50:07.713 --> 50:09.124
Yes, it is.

50:10.674 --> 50:12.665
A high school girl's
been murdered.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.709
Mr. Harrison's daughter
is missing.

50:15.179 --> 50:16.761
And now at the house
where she lives,

50:16.972 --> 50:19.589
the other girls are getting
obscene phone calls.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.805
Don't you think we ought
to look into it, Nash?

50:24.563 --> 50:27.146
Well, Lieutenant, I guess, sure.

50:28.442 --> 50:29.682
Thank you, Lieutenant.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.276
Yeah, thanks Ken.

51:15.364 --> 51:16.729
Sergeant Nash.

51:17.116 --> 51:18.698
Could I speak to you
for a minute?

51:19.201 --> 51:20.987
Yeah… sure, Lieutenant.

51:25.124 --> 51:26.535
What's this?

51:27.543 --> 51:29.409
That's the number
at the sorority house.

51:30.254 --> 51:31.164
Fellatio?

51:32.131 --> 51:34.793
Yeah, it's the new exchange,
llFll-"Ell.

51:36.552 --> 51:38.088
The new exchange?

51:39.638 --> 51:41.049
Yeah, fellatio.

51:41.640 --> 51:44.098
One of the girls that was
in this afternoon gave it to me.

51:44.518 --> 51:45.633
She gave it to you?

51:46.937 --> 51:47.847
Yeah.

51:48.856 --> 51:50.688
Nash, I don't think you
could pick your nose

51:50.899 --> 51:52.481
without written instructions.

52:09.126 --> 52:11.618
I know.
Something dirty, ain't it?

52:22.348 --> 52:24.055
You selfish bitch.

52:24.725 --> 52:26.341
You're talking about
killing our baby

52:26.560 --> 52:28.050
as though you were having
a wart removed.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.887
Now, can you see why I didn't
want to tell you?

52:31.106 --> 52:32.221
What the hell are you trying
to do to me?

52:32.691 --> 52:34.307
What are you doing to yourself?

52:43.077 --> 52:44.033
Jess,

52:45.245 --> 52:46.861
Let's get one thing straight.

52:48.749 --> 52:50.740
You are not going
to abort that baby.

52:51.126 --> 52:53.834
Peter, you're not gonna tell me
what I can and cannot do.

52:54.463 --> 52:55.624
Jess, if you try getting
an abortion…

52:55.839 --> 52:56.920
I think you'd better leave!

52:57.132 --> 52:58.213
If you try getting an abortion…

52:58.425 --> 52:59.836
I said get out!

53:04.390 --> 53:06.131
You're gonna be very sorry.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.187
Hi, Peter.

53:19.863 --> 53:21.194
I'll get Jess.

53:25.285 --> 53:28.778
- Jess, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

53:29.915 --> 53:30.905
Any more news?

53:31.166 --> 53:32.577
No, but there's some people here

53:32.793 --> 53:33.999
to see about the phone calls.

53:40.801 --> 53:43.668
Jess, this is Lieutenant Fuller,
and, I'm sorry.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.127
Uh, Graham, Bill Graham.

53:45.347 --> 53:47.258
Are you the person who
called the station today?

53:47.474 --> 53:48.179
Yes.

53:48.392 --> 53:49.678
I would like to put a tap
on your phone.

53:49.893 --> 53:50.758
But we'll need your
written permission

53:50.978 --> 53:52.639
to do that if it's
okay with you?

53:52.855 --> 53:53.890
- 0kay.
- Okay, Graham,

53:54.106 --> 53:54.641
You can go ahead.

53:54.857 --> 53:56.347
And I'd like to see
Clare Harrison's room.

53:56.567 --> 53:57.432
- Sure.
- Where's the telephone?

53:57.735 --> 53:58.520
Uh, there's one
in the living room

53:58.736 --> 53:59.646
and one here in the hallway.

53:59.862 --> 54:00.977
Clare's room is up here.

54:05.576 --> 54:07.032
How many girls
live in this house?

54:07.453 --> 54:08.989
Uh, usually ten.

54:21.925 --> 54:24.917
Hello, this is Lineman Graham,
at Six Belmont.

54:25.137 --> 54:28.346
I'm working line 559-6114.

54:29.433 --> 54:30.218
Great.

54:34.188 --> 54:35.474
This afternoon, I got a call

54:35.689 --> 54:37.726
from a woman that I
thought was a wrong number.

54:38.025 --> 54:39.891
But then she started
screaming at me.

54:40.861 --> 54:44.195
Who was the last one here
to see Miss Harrison?

54:44.490 --> 54:47.357
- I think I was.
- When, approximately?

54:48.035 --> 54:49.946
Last night, about 10:30.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.702
Is this the way she
left her room,

54:52.915 --> 54:53.620
as far as you know?

54:53.832 --> 54:54.572
Yes.

54:57.336 --> 54:58.076
What's this?

54:58.295 --> 54:59.785
We were having
a party last night.

55:00.714 --> 55:02.079
She drink a lot?

55:02.966 --> 55:04.377
No, hardly at all.

55:06.637 --> 55:08.048
Does she have
any emotional problems,

55:08.263 --> 55:09.298
anything like that?

55:09.556 --> 55:10.887
<i>No, not Clare.</i>

55:15.729 --> 55:17.766
Who was she seeing
besides Chris Hayden?

55:18.732 --> 55:20.973
- No one.
- Sure of that?

55:23.821 --> 55:25.357
So, you were the last one
to see her

55:25.572 --> 55:26.403
sometime this morning?

55:26.615 --> 55:28.902
- Last night.
- Right, last night.

55:29.243 --> 55:30.859
Well, did anyone see her
this morning?

55:31.286 --> 55:32.447
- I didn't.

55:32.788 --> 55:34.699
And all the others girls
have gone for the holidays.

55:35.415 --> 55:36.780
Can I get a list
of their phone numbers

55:37.000 --> 55:37.705
where I can reach them?

55:37.918 --> 55:39.534
Sure. There's one
in Mrs. Mac's room.

55:40.754 --> 55:42.870
- Who's Mrs. Mac?
- She's the house mother.

55:50.472 --> 55:51.883
Is there anyone else
in the house right now?

55:52.099 --> 55:54.215
Yes, another girl,
Barbara Coard.

55:54.434 --> 55:57.552
She's upstairs asleep.
Um, she's not feeling too well.

55:58.355 --> 56:00.517
Is she the one that was
at the station today?

56:00.732 --> 56:04.976
<i>Noah.
Noah, we“. ht her shop.</i>

56:05.362 --> 56:06.227
Okay.

56:06.780 --> 56:08.646
Were there any deliveries
yesterday?

56:08.866 --> 56:10.072
Or was anyone working
in the house,

56:10.284 --> 56:10.989
anything like that?

56:11.201 --> 56:12.817
No, I don't think so.
Mrs. Mac would know.

56:13.036 --> 56:14.117
Is her sister's number
on this list?

56:14.496 --> 56:15.236
Yes.

56:15.455 --> 56:17.787
Graham, how's it going?
You about finished?

56:18.709 --> 56:20.916
Yeah. What I've done is,
I've tapped this phone,

56:21.128 --> 56:21.833
so that when it rings,

56:22.045 --> 56:23.410
it'll ring
at the station house, too.

56:23.839 --> 56:24.579
At the same time,

56:24.798 --> 56:26.664
I'll be at the phone company
checking on the location

56:26.884 --> 56:27.794
of the source of the call.

56:28.343 --> 56:29.754
Are there any other phones
in the house?

56:30.178 --> 56:31.418
Yes, the house mother
has a line.

56:31.638 --> 56:32.343
Yeah, but it's another number,

56:32.556 --> 56:33.671
and there haven't been
any calls on it

56:34.099 --> 56:35.430
You're gonna have
to keep this guy

56:35.642 --> 56:37.007
on the line as long as possible.

56:37.227 --> 56:39.343
We got a mechanical system here
and it takes a while.

56:39.563 --> 56:40.974
I know It's not very pleasant.
But-

56:41.231 --> 56:42.847
Uh, girls, can I
show you something?

56:46.987 --> 56:48.398
<i>- See the car outside?
- Yeah.</i>

56:48.614 --> 56:49.604
<i>We got one of our men In It,</i>

56:49.823 --> 56:51.188
<i>so you've got nothing
to worry about.</i>

56:52.367 --> 56:53.778
Yeah, sure.

57:26.902 --> 57:30.190
I just know Clare is dead.
I can just feel it.

57:30.405 --> 57:32.237
Oh, come on now, Phyl,
we don't know that.

57:33.367 --> 57:37.577
Poor Mr. Harrison!
I feel so sorry for him!

57:37.788 --> 57:39.620
Hey, hey.

57:43.251 --> 57:44.332
How's Chris?

57:44.753 --> 57:47.791
Oh, he's okay.
You know Chris.

57:51.218 --> 57:52.583
Oh, God.

57:54.513 --> 57:56.254
I'm sorry, Jess.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.142
<i>I guess I'm just exhausted.</i>

58:02.980 --> 58:04.721
I've been taking these pills
for my cold

58:04.940 --> 58:06.101
and they knock me out.

58:07.609 --> 58:09.395
Will you be okay
if I go up to bed?

58:09.861 --> 58:11.192
Yes, of course.

58:12.489 --> 58:13.570
Are you sure?

58:13.782 --> 58:15.568
Yes, go up and get some rest.

58:27.796 --> 58:29.286
Call me if there's any news.

58:30.215 --> 58:31.000
IWlll.

58:32.801 --> 58:33.757
Thanks.

58:34.469 --> 58:35.755
- Good night, Phyl.
- Good night.

58:55.532 --> 58:58.320
Yeah, everything clear
on your end Jeff?

58:59.244 --> 59:02.828
Okay. Sure. Uh, yeah.

59:03.415 --> 59:06.077
Now look, I'm gonna need
about 10 more minutes.

59:07.127 --> 59:08.743
Now be sure you
tell those people again

59:08.962 --> 59:10.828
they gotta keep this guy
on the line.

59:11.256 --> 59:12.166
Right.

59:12.632 --> 59:14.669
'Cause he hasn't worn his hat
for the last two days.

59:15.218 --> 59:16.800
Yes, we certainly will
look into that.

59:17.012 --> 59:17.877
Thank you very much.

59:18.930 --> 59:20.170
Jesus!

59:20.974 --> 59:22.464
Graham's nearly ready
at the switching station.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.683
Now, when the phone rings
at the house there,

59:24.895 --> 59:25.805
this one will ring, too.

59:26.021 --> 59:26.931
The transmitters have
been removed,

59:27.147 --> 59:28.888
so, uh, we won't pick
anything up at all

59:29.107 --> 59:29.847
from this end.

59:30.067 --> 59:30.977
Great, thanks.

Hello?

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.896
Jess, we didn't get him.

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:14.227
There wasn't enough time.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:16.029
You'll have to keep him
on the line longer.

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:18.736
Oh, I see.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:24.822
When you said, um, "Oh, my God, “
did you recognize something?

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:29.827
No, I just guess it was
kind of getting to me.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:35.882
Um, when he called before,

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.552
did he use more than one voice
like this?

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:40.345
Yes, yes, he did.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:41.922
He used several
different voices.

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:46.301

- Bernie!
- Yup?

01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:14.086
Call a doctor.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:15.755
I'm not lettin' no
son of a bitch

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.171
trespass on my land
in the middle of the night!

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:20.002
I don't care what kind
of a uniform he wears!

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.462
- What the hell is going on here?
- He fired on a police officer.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:23.680
You're goddamn right!

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:26.258
I'd do it again, too!
The bastard was trespassing!

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.221
Cogan got an assful of birdshot.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.727
Yeah, I'm gonna make
the son of the bitch

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.850
pick every one of 'em out
with his teeth.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:35.517
The next time, you're
gonna get the gun up your ass!

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.736
Sideways!

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:43.908
If you laugh, Buchanan, I'll
bust you to boy scout, I swear!

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:49.952
If you think it was Peter,
then why didn't you

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:50.953
just tell the police?

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.746
Well, because I'm not
really sure.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.207
Well, he should be stopped.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:56.037
Whoever it is should be stopped.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:58.790
God, Jess, I haven't had
a minute's sleep around here.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.759
There's been so much noise
in the house.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.586
What the hell was all that
yelling about?

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:05.091
Barb had an asthma attack.
She was having a nightmare.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:06.514
Is she all right?

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:08.966
Yes, she's fine.
She's sleeping now.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:13.270
He repeated almost word for word
what Peter said to me tonight.

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:15.477
Couldn't it just be
a coincidence?

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:16.979
Oh God, Phyl, I don't know.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.603
I'm so confused.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:24.282
Oh, look, Jess, I really don't
think it could be Peter.

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.359
You know, I don't like
Peter much,

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.161
but I don't think he's
that sick.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:30.283
I don't believe Peter
would do this.

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:32.573
He's so gentle most of the time.

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:36.044
Oh, God, Phyl! You know,
I'm really getting scared?

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.126
Look, are you sure that cop's
still out there?

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:43.292
Yep, he's there.

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:03.362
Hello?

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:05.774
<i>Jess?</i>

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:07.864
Yes?

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.537
<i>Oh, God, please help me.</i>

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.332
Oh look, Peter, don't cry.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:15.951
We can straighten things out.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.831
There's nothing to
get so upset about.

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.001
- Yeah?
- It's Bill Graham.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.302
You want me to trace that one?

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:28.012
Yeah, try and get it.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.180
Right.

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:32.346
<i>Jess, Jess!</i>

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.519
<i>We can't kill the baby!
Please, Jess!</i>

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.438
<i>We can't kill the baby!</i>

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.195
Peter, where are you?

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:45.272
<i>Please, Jess!</i>

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.775
<i>You know how I feel about
the baby.</i>

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:50.201
Don't do this.

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.238
<i>Jess, don't hurt the baby!</i>

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:56.700
<i>- Stop this, Peter.
- You want our baby…</i>

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.502
<i>I know you do.
I don't want to hurt this baby.</i>

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:00.419
<i>Jess, please!</i>

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.167
Peter, please tell me
where you are.

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:17.971
I'm sorry.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:20.978
Yeah, the call's
just aren't long enough!

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:24.148
Right.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.412
Yes?

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.206
Jess, Lieutenant Fuller.

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:38.537
Do you want to tell me what
that's all about?

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:41.036
- You listened to that?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:44.089
<i>What did he mean about
killing the baby?</i>

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.135
Jess, it's important that
you tell me.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:54.929
I'm pregnant.

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:57.473
I told him I didn't want
to have the baby.

01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:59.771
When did you tell him this?

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:01.890
<i>Today.</i>

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.479
Just today? You're sure?

01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:04.525
<i>Yes.</i>

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:09.109
<i>"We can't kill the baby",</i>

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.941
<i>that's a strange way
of putting it.</i>

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.611
<i>Peter's an artist.
He's very high strung.</i>

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:15.995
Neurotic, maybe?

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:17.155
No.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.082
No more than a lot of people.

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:23.169
<i>Jess, are you
telling me the truth?</i>

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:26.123
I've got a feeling you're
holding something back from me.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.799
Now, I don't want it
to be Peter.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.752
But if it is, he needs help.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.428
Do you know what I mean?

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:34.047
The sooner, the better.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.683
<i>Now, look, think back.</i>

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:39.222
<i>Was Peter with you
any of the times</i>

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:41.099
<i>that you got one of these calls?</i>

01:12:43.401 --> 01:12:44.812
Yes!

01:12:45.486 --> 01:12:46.772
Yes, he was here!

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:49.275
He was at the house tonight
when the first call came!

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.197
That's right!
It couldn't be Peter!

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:54.029
Phyl, it couldn't be Peter!
He was here!

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.820
Well, he's obviously upset about
something.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:57.744
I'd like to talk to him.

01:12:57.957 --> 01:12:59.038
<i>Can you tell me where I
might reach him?</i>

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.954
Uh, well, he lives
at Baker House.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:04.036
Uh, but when he gets like this,
he usually goes down

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:05.120
to the Recital Hall

01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:06.955
at the Music Conservatory
and plays.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:10.125
Look, Jess, if you
get any more calls,

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:12.130
you're gonna have to keep him
on the line longer.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.087
You're not giving us enough time
to get a trace.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.881
I'm trying, you know,
it really upsets me.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.101
<i>Alright, of course.
Look, you're doing fine.</i>

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:21.269
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:22.557
Okay.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:26.562
Thank God!

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:29.856
I knew it couldn't have
been Peter.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:34.945
Well, what can I tell you?

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:36.780
We covered
the entire campus area.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.736
They're working their way
toward the lake now.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.530
Where do we go from there?

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:43.203
Start 'em out
on the south end of town,

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.625
have them work their way
through town

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.077
on a house-to-house.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.724
Jess, do you want
one aspirin or two?

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:10.359
<i>- Two, please.</i>
- Okay!

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.948
<i>Jess! Jess!</i>

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.083
What are you doing?

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.002
Some kind of a search party.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.088
Yes?

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:34.126
Sorry to scare you, Miss,
but we're with the search party.

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:37.670
Well, what do you want?

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:40.552
Well, we wondered if you'd
seen anything peculiar tonight.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.054
Well, not until you got here.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.557
Well, they scared the
shit out of me!

01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:45.807
Sorry, miss, but you do know

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:47.479
there was a girl killed
in the park tonight?

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:48.397
Yes, we heard.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:49.565
Well, we're just
helping the police

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:50.812
to look for the killer.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:52.610
Well, we'd ask you in,
you know…

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.358
But our dog died last night.

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:56.022
Oh, <i>wow.</i>

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:58.324
Well… well, we don't want
to bother you

01:14:58.536 --> 01:14:59.241
at a time like that.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.865
Uh, we were just wondering
if you noticed

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.321
anything suspicious here
tonight?

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:04.451
Oh, no. Sorry.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.908
Well, you just keep your
doors and windows locked,

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.580
and. uh, and you'll be safe.
- Okay.

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:09.752
- Do you understand?
- Thank a lot. We will.

01:15:09.964 --> 01:15:10.795
And remember,
there might be others

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:11.712
from the search party around.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:13.005
So, don't be afraid.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.457
We'll be around seeing that
you're safe.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:15.382
Thank you very…

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:17.005
Remember to lock those doors
and windows, now.

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:18.461
- Okay, then.
- Bye now.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.850
I'd rather face the killer!

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:30.015
Seriously, do you realize this
is the only door and window

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.440
in this whole house that's
locked?

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.233
Get that Dean of Admissions
on the phone.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.612
Tell him I want all records
on a "Peter Smythe“,

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.489
a music student,

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:49.125
and have a car
meet me out front.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.471
♫

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:26.412
Barb? Are you awake?

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:27.997
<i>Agnes.</i>

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:13.622
Phyl!

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.545
Are you there?

01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:18.289
Phyl!

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:40.360
- Hello?
<i>- Hi!</i>

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:42.275
You <i>pig!</i>

01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:45.240
<i>You fat pig!</i>

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:47.781
<i>You pig!</i>

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.739
<i>You bitch pig!
Look at your little baby!</i>

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:53.245
<i>No, Billy. No!</i>

01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:02.000
<i>Ouch!
Help! Help! Help!</i>

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:09.010
<i>Billy!</i>

01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:11.012
<i>Billy!</i>

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:13.264
<i>Where's the baby?
Where's Agnes?</i>

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.517
<i>You left Billy alone with Agnes!</i>

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:17.315
<i>- Billy!
- Where's the baby?</i>

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.403
<i>Where's the baby?
Billy! Billy!</i>

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:30.365
Lieutenant!
The guy's on the phone again!

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:45.634
<i>Come on, Billy's sick!</i>

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:56.520
<i>I know you're there,</i>

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:57.563
<i>nasty Billy!</i>

01:18:57.775 --> 01:18:59.561
<i>You answer me this minute!</i>

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:01.313
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:03.144
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:05.901
<i>- Come here!
- Mommy!</i>

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:07.151
<i>Where's Agnes?</i>

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:11.489
Agnes!

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:15.202
<i>Give Mommy the baby!</i>

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.158
<i>Baby's all right, Mommy!</i>

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:18.368
<i>You have to find her.</i>

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:23.752
This is Graham.
It's group 140, terminal 55.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:30.679
<i>…Agnes in.</i>

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:39.351
<i>Lieutenant Fuller?</i>

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.061
Yeah, Nash. What is it?

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.767
<i>Uh, phone company's
on the other line, sir.</i>

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.523
<i>They say they
got a trace on this one.</i>

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:45.773
Yeah, let's have it.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.480
<i>He says the calls are coming</i>

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.441
<i>from number six, Belmont Street.</i>

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:52.660
For Chrissakes, Nash,
you got it wrong.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:54.828
That's where the calls
are going into.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.077
<i>That's where they're
coming from, too, sir.</i>

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:59.034
♫

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.962
Oh, shit!

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:10.295
Jennings?

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:12.926
Jennings?

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:15.929
Jennings!

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.015
Jennings!

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:20.847
Jennings, where the hell
are you?

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:28.529
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:31.111
Look, I can't get through
to Jennings.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:33.113
I want you to call that girl.

01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:35.660
Nash, be calm.

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:37.864
Don't tell her that the guy is
in the house.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.414
Just tell her to
put down the phone

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:41.583
and walk straight out
the front door.

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:44.082
I'll be there in five minutes.

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:46.881
And Nash, if you blow this,
I'll kill you.

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:49.584
Phyl?

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:52.003
Phyl! Where are you?

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:54.847
Please answer me!

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:13.699
Hello?

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:15.739
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:18.742
It's Jess.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.083
Uh, Miss Bradford,
uh, this is Sergeant Nash.

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.535
Are you the only one
in the house?

01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:29.799
No. Phyl and Barb
are upstairs asleep. Why?

01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:31.251
All right.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.552
Now, I want you to do
exactly what I tell you

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:35.846
without asking any questions,
okay?

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:38.511
No, no, no questions.

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:41.427
<i>Now, just put the phone
back on the hook,</i>

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:44.897
<i>walk to the front door,
and leave the house.</i>

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:46.807
What's wrong?

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:50.315
Please, Miss Bradford,
please just do as I tell you.

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:53.614
Okay. I'll…
I'll get Phyl and Barb.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.113
No, no, no!
Don't do that, Jess!

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:01.198
Jess, the caller is
in the house!

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:03.908
<i>The calls are
coming from the house!</i>

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:06.623
Jess!

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:11.416
<i>Jess, get out!
And don't go up there!</i>

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.591
<i>Don't go upstairs, Jess!</i>

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:20.262
<i>Miss Bradford!
Miss Bradford!</i>

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.220
Miss Bradford?

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:27.773
<i>Miss Bradford?</i>

01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:30.480
Barb.

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:35.864
Phyl!

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.948
<i>Oh, please. answer me!</i>

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:50.380
Phyl! Barb!
Please, answer me!

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.919
Please, answer me!

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:57.757
Please! Oh! Oh!

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.895
♫

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:24.097
Barb?

01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:27.308
Phyl?

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:44.242
<i>Agnes.</i>

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.451
Agnes, it's me, Billy!

01:24:49.876 --> 01:24:54.541
Agnes, Agnes, don't you
tell what we did, Agnes.

01:27:58.565 --> 01:27:59.680
Jess?

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:02.941
Jess? Are you all right?

01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:05.861
Jess?

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.614
Jess, are you in there?

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:32.054
Jess!

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:47.644
Jess?

01:28:56.122 --> 01:28:57.533
Jess?

01:28:58.333 --> 01:28:59.414
Jess?

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:06.872
Jess, is that you?

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:13.800
Jess, are you in there?

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:24.102
<i>Jess?</i>

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:30.608
<i>Jess, is that you?</i>

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.868
Jess, why didn't you answer me?

01:29:45.171 --> 01:29:46.912
What's all the yelling about?

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:50.374
Jess, you had me worried.

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:52.297
What are you doing down here?

01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:06.412
<i>Jess?</i>

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:16.802
<i>I knew it.
I knew it in my gut.</i>

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:17.969
<i>It was that kid.</i>

01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:20.722
<i>Why would Peter
start killing people?</i>

01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:24.385
<i>I don't know.
He must've made a call after…</i>

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:27.688
<i>After each murder.</i>

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.435
<i>It's hard to believe Jess
would kill anybody,</i>

01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:30.561
<i>much less Peter!</i>

01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:32.184
And she's under.

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:33.610
<i>How long do you
think it'll be before I</i>

01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:34.778
<i>can talk to her?</i>

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:36.151
<i>Just a couple questions.</i>

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:38.948
Well, she'll be out
for at least four hours,

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.241
pretty groggy after that.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.073
What time do her parents
get here?

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:43.119
A couple of hours.

01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:44.829
They're driving down
from Unionville.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:46.782
I'll stay with her till then.

01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:48.871
With the condition she's in,

01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:50.202
I wouldn't count on talking
to her

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:52.254
before tomorrow afternoon,
if I were you.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:54.835
Has anybody notified
Patrick Cornell?

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:57.463
- Who?
- Uh, Phyl's boyfriend.

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:04.512
Uh, Lieutenant! I think we're
gonna have to take these bodies

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:06.218
to the morgue in Lincolnville.

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:07.723
The hospital doesn't have

01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:09.555
facilities to handle this many
at one time.

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:11.310
All right, tell the coroner,
they have to get started

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:13.016
on the autopsies right away.

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:15.732
Then notify the parents
for identification.

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:16.771
Yes, sir.

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:18.981
Uh, I think that about
wraps everything up here, sir.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.737
Uh, state lab guys will be here
in about an hour, they said.

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:28.282
Uh, reporters, sir,
and television news guys.

01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:29.491
They want pictures.

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:30.951
Get them the hell out of here!

01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:32.582
Tell them I'll meet them down
at the station, would you?

01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:35.084
<i>All right, guys.
C'mon! Move back downstairs!</i>

01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:39.794
<i>Is the Bradford girl
being charged with…</i>

01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:41.174
<i>How 'bout a picture?</i>

01:32:41.765 --> 01:32:44.177
<i>All right, you guys.
Come on, back off! Back off!</i>

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.507
<i>Yes, the girl's father's
upstairs</i>

01:32:45.685 --> 01:32:46.675
<i>but he can't tell you anything.</i>

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:47.851
<i>Would you keep it down, please?</i>

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:49.553
<i>We've got a sick girl in here.</i>

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:57.026
<i>Come on, get out!
Cowards!</i>

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.442
<i>- Let's go, come on!
- Come on, move it!</i>

01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:00.863
He's in shock.

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:04.284
Help me get him downstairs.
He's got to go to a hospital.

01:33:05.038 --> 01:33:06.699
You should be all right,
Mr. Harrison.

01:33:07.457 --> 01:33:08.822
She's gonna be back!
I know it!

01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:12.667
<i>Okay, give us a hand, here.</i>

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:13.619
<i>Hey you!</i>

01:33:13.838 --> 01:33:15.124
<i>Nash, will you see that
everything's wrapped up?</i>

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.046
<i>All right, Lieutenant. will do.</i>

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:18.043
<i>Hey, Lieutenant!</i>

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:19.920
<i>Hey you! Come on!
Out! Out!</i>

01:33:20.303 --> 01:33:22.340
<i>You want to spend the night
in the can? Move!</i>

01:33:23.306 --> 01:33:25.468
<i>Jesus! What's the matter
with this guy?</i>

01:33:25.892 --> 01:33:26.848
<i>He's suffering from shock.</i>

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.221
<i>We have to get him
to the hospital.</i>

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.517
<i>Can you get us a car, Nash?</i>

01:33:30.021 --> 01:33:31.887
Yeah, yeah, let's go!

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:33.347
<i>All right, McCloskey,</i>

01:33:33.566 --> 01:33:34.806
<i>you heard what
the Lieutenant said!</i>

01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:36.395
<i>Right.</i>

01:35:32.727 --> 01:35:34.309
<i>Agnes!</i>

01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:36.846
<i>It's me, Billy!</i>
