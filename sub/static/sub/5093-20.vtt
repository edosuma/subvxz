00:08.173 --> 00:09.941
(camera clicks)

00:09.943 --> 00:11.593
You think it's going down?

00:11.595 --> 00:14.279
Well, they called their
dealer about an hour ago.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.816
That's Billy Chin, Jared Mehra,
and Russell Wilson.

00:17.818 --> 00:18.950
Their dealer,

00:18.952 --> 00:20.819
Christopher Dean,

00:20.821 --> 00:23.521
specializes in
high-end dope.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.941
Coke, pills,
fentanyl patches.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.460
They're real big with the
downtown party crowd.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.861
Brokers, lawyers...

00:29.863 --> 00:32.247
So much for the
three martini lunch.

00:32.249 --> 00:35.199
We've been looking at this Dean
for about eight months now.

00:35.201 --> 00:39.104
Haven't been able to catch him
in the act.

00:40.973 --> 00:42.841
Till now.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.342
Your boy's here.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.727
All right, everybody,

00:45.729 --> 00:49.431
sit tight until the money
changes hands, okay?

00:49.433 --> 00:50.715
Got it.

00:50.717 --> 00:55.053
DANNY: Okay, here's our boy,
Christopher Dean.

00:57.189 --> 00:58.556
Who's the muscle?

00:58.558 --> 00:59.941
I don't know.

01:01.393 --> 01:02.811
Dean usually
works alone.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.679
I never saw
this guy before.

01:04.681 --> 01:07.415
My friend.

01:07.417 --> 01:09.534
How are you,
my friend?

01:09.536 --> 01:10.869
How are you?
Looking good.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.537
What's up, Christopher?
Sir.

01:12.539 --> 01:14.238
Your new partner's
looking creepier than usual.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.507
(sniffs)

01:15.509 --> 01:16.741
Ah, he's okay.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.677
Lot of competition
for this stuff.

01:20.096 --> 01:22.380
What's up, tough guy?

01:23.432 --> 01:24.916
Want a drink?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.434
Feel like you could use one.

01:26.436 --> 01:27.852
Back off, Russell.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.754
Where's the cash?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.940
Got it right here.

01:34.727 --> 01:36.778
All right, here we go.

01:36.780 --> 01:38.262
Need to relax, man.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.982
You know,
get laid once in a while.

01:40.984 --> 01:42.767
You'll live longer.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.703
You won't.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.121
(people screaming)

01:46.123 --> 01:47.622
Shots fired!

01:48.774 --> 01:50.241
Come on, move it!

01:50.243 --> 01:51.459
Move!

01:51.461 --> 01:52.627
What the hell?!

01:52.629 --> 01:53.628
Let's go.

01:53.630 --> 01:55.814
(sirens wailing)

01:56.949 --> 01:59.250
Company.

02:04.340 --> 02:06.324
Dean!

02:10.645 --> 02:11.596
(tires screeching)

02:11.598 --> 02:13.297
DANNY:
Get out of there!

02:13.299 --> 02:15.350
Get out of the way!
(car horn honking)

02:15.352 --> 02:17.302
Get out of the way!

02:17.304 --> 02:18.770
Those two don't move!

02:18.772 --> 02:20.021
On the ground.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.159
Looks like you got hit,
you piece of garbage.

02:24.161 --> 02:25.493
Turn over.

02:26.495 --> 02:27.662
Wilson's gone.

02:27.664 --> 02:30.615
Yeah, well,
Dean here needs a bus.

02:35.287 --> 02:37.339
But we've been
down this road before.

02:37.341 --> 02:39.824
When Nicky goes
around my back to you,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.659
you need to just
shut her down.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.844
I did.

02:42.846 --> 02:45.547
I said she needed your
permission, not mine.

02:45.549 --> 02:49.384
And she takes that as meaning
you don't disapprove.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.469
That's not my place to
approve or disapprove,

02:51.471 --> 02:54.022
and I don't appreciate being
put in the middle of it.

02:57.193 --> 02:58.727
What the hell is this?

02:58.729 --> 03:00.111
Don't look at me.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.279
Amanda.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.864
Erin, Commissioner.

03:02.866 --> 03:05.050
Hello, Amanda.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.152
So you running
the D.A.'s office yet?

03:07.154 --> 03:09.571
Still just humble
trial bureau chief.

03:09.573 --> 03:10.905
I'm sorry to interrupt.

03:10.907 --> 03:12.240
I was going to do this tomorrow,

03:12.242 --> 03:13.908
but since your father
happens to be here,

03:13.910 --> 03:16.294
I thought he might like to share
in the good news.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.213
Good news?

03:18.215 --> 03:20.632
Unless you're not interested

03:20.634 --> 03:22.967
in being my new
deputy bureau chief.

03:25.304 --> 03:28.006
I believe it's customary
to say something at this point.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.373
Deputy bureau chief?

03:29.375 --> 03:30.759
Are you kidding me?

03:30.761 --> 03:32.143
Not if I send champagne.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.211
Congratulations.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.562
Thank you, Amanda.

03:34.564 --> 03:35.730
I won't let you down.

03:35.732 --> 03:36.731
You better not.

03:36.733 --> 03:38.483
Would you like
to join us for a drink?

03:38.485 --> 03:39.734
I'm afraid I'm on my way

03:39.736 --> 03:41.352
to a cocktail party
at Gracie Mansion.

03:41.354 --> 03:42.904
Oh, I begged out of that.

03:42.906 --> 03:44.489
Don't tell the mayor you saw me.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.274
Your secret is safe with me.

03:46.276 --> 03:47.575
I'll see you
tomorrow, Erin.

03:47.577 --> 03:49.778
Thank you.

03:51.197 --> 03:52.747
Come on, I just got
a few questions.

03:52.749 --> 03:55.066
Christopher Dean's on his
way to surgery, Detective.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.501
It'll take two seconds.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.086
You'll have to talk
to my supervisor.

03:58.088 --> 03:59.370
Fine. Where is he?

03:59.372 --> 04:00.571
She's over there.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.573
We got a
tibial fracture

04:02.575 --> 04:04.509
in curtain three.
Excuse me.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.844
And MVA victim

04:05.846 --> 04:07.411
in trauma one.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.546
Hey.
Hey.

04:08.548 --> 04:10.414
Guy came in with a
bullet in his gut.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.517
He was part of a drug
deal turned homicide.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.219
Yeah, paramedics told me.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.303
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:15.305 --> 04:16.855
But, look, his accomplice,

04:16.857 --> 04:18.305
he killed a guy
and got away.

04:18.308 --> 04:19.923
I need your patient
to I.D. him.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.108
Is he conscious?

04:21.111 --> 04:22.477
Yeah, but he's in bad shape.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.145
I can't let you see him
till after surgery.

04:24.147 --> 04:26.448
Well, hold on, Linda. I just
got ask him a few questions.

04:26.450 --> 04:28.450
I need a name; it's
gonna take two seconds.

04:28.452 --> 04:30.201
Danny, it's against
hospital policy.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.569
But even if it wasn't,

04:31.571 --> 04:32.954
I wouldn't let you see him.

04:32.956 --> 04:34.873
What do you mean? I'm trying
to find a murderer here.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.291
Yeah, well,
I got a patient to save,

04:36.293 --> 04:37.742
and in this building,
that comes first.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.494
Hey!
Danny!

04:41.580 --> 04:43.915
There is an officer posted
on Dean.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.668
When he gets out of surgery,
I will let you know.

05:18.665 --> 05:21.033
Hey, did the hospital say when
we can talk to Christopher Dean?

05:21.035 --> 05:22.956
The hospital? No.
What's this?

05:23.146 --> 05:24.311
Dean's rap sheet.

05:24.313 --> 05:25.763
A few possession collars,
nothing violent.

05:25.765 --> 05:28.098
That all changed when he
hooked up with Captain Psycho.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.100
Yeah, you pull the photos
of his known associates?

05:30.102 --> 05:32.036
Yeah, nothing
matches our shooter.

05:32.038 --> 05:33.287
Dean used to work for

05:33.289 --> 05:34.772
one of the big
brokerage houses downtown

05:34.774 --> 05:36.106
before he started selling drugs.

05:36.108 --> 05:38.209
I know;
hence the clientele list.

05:38.211 --> 05:40.628
The other two buyers--
where'd we stick those jokers?

05:40.630 --> 05:42.963
Uh, Jared Mehra is
in interrogation one,

05:42.965 --> 05:44.632
and Billy Chin's
in the radio room.

05:44.634 --> 05:45.833
All right.

05:45.835 --> 05:47.418
You take Frick, I'll take Frack.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.253
You know you're in big trouble,
right, Jared?

05:49.255 --> 05:50.304
We were just partying.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.806
Next thing I know,
Russell's dead.

05:51.808 --> 05:54.958
Mm-hmm. Let's talk about
how Russell got that way.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.177
Russell had a big mouth,

05:56.179 --> 05:57.762
but he didn't deserve
to get shot.

05:57.764 --> 05:59.180
That's why you're gonna
give us the name

05:59.182 --> 06:00.314
of the guy that killed him.

06:00.316 --> 06:01.799
I never saw that guy before.

06:01.801 --> 06:03.651
(groans):
Oh, come on.

06:03.653 --> 06:05.686
You really expect
me to believe this?

06:05.688 --> 06:09.807
I swear, we only used
to deal with Christopher.

06:09.809 --> 06:12.443
Look, the call to set up the buy
came from your cell phone.

06:12.445 --> 06:13.828
You cooperate here,

06:13.830 --> 06:14.995
you can help yourself,

06:14.997 --> 06:16.831
so why don't you just stop
wasting my time.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.032
I didn't do anything.

06:18.034 --> 06:20.984
We have you on tape
paying for narcotics, Billy.

06:20.986 --> 06:22.002
I want a lawyer.

06:22.004 --> 06:23.537
I'm calling my attorney.

06:23.539 --> 06:26.874
Let me guess,
your guy's lawyered up, too.

06:26.876 --> 06:28.876
Yeah, claimed he can't
I.D. the shooter.

06:28.878 --> 06:30.828
More like he's afraid to.

06:30.830 --> 06:32.963
Either way,
once they're arraigned,

06:32.965 --> 06:34.348
they're back out on the street.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.851
Yeah, which means
no more questioning.

06:36.853 --> 06:39.303
You get anything
off the crime scene photos?

06:39.305 --> 06:40.471
Not yet.

06:40.473 --> 06:42.172
Perp's car is registered
to Christopher Dean.

06:42.174 --> 06:43.440
I sent out a
Finest Message

06:43.442 --> 06:44.775
to locate the vehicle.

06:44.777 --> 06:47.177
In other words, we're nowhere.

06:49.013 --> 06:51.949
All hail the queen!

06:51.951 --> 06:55.035
(cheering)

06:56.488 --> 06:57.872
Thank you.

06:57.874 --> 07:00.241
Very... I'm very touched.

07:00.243 --> 07:01.709
Thank you.

07:01.711 --> 07:03.961
(sighs)

07:03.963 --> 07:06.747
I just want to say,
now that I'm your boss,

07:06.749 --> 07:08.532
that nothing has changed.

07:08.534 --> 07:11.001
Except, now I can fire

07:11.003 --> 07:13.637
any one of you at the
drop of a hat, so...

07:13.639 --> 07:14.922
(laughter)

07:14.924 --> 07:17.091
You should remember,
no direct eye contact,

07:17.093 --> 07:19.560
and don't forget to bow.

07:19.562 --> 07:20.644
There-there you go.

07:20.646 --> 07:21.896
Thank you.

07:21.898 --> 07:23.230
Okay, go back to work.

07:23.232 --> 07:24.732
And don't screw up.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.934
(cheering)

07:28.520 --> 07:30.220
Thank you.
I look forward to your reign.

07:30.222 --> 07:31.989
(laughs)

07:31.991 --> 07:33.357
Hey, what's up, Rachel?

07:33.359 --> 07:35.893
I just wanted to say I'm
excited to be working with you.

07:35.895 --> 07:37.828
And at the risk of
sounding like a suck-up,

07:37.830 --> 07:39.330
I consider you a role model.

07:39.332 --> 07:40.397
Well, thank you.

07:40.399 --> 07:41.949
I'm happy that
you're on the team.

07:43.335 --> 07:45.085
Is there something else?

07:45.087 --> 07:48.205
Thing is, I just caught
a sexual assault case.

07:48.207 --> 07:49.673
Wayne Devereaux, right?

07:49.675 --> 07:50.958
Raped a 65-year-old?

07:50.960 --> 07:52.242
Case is open-and-shut.

07:52.244 --> 07:53.460
He was caught in the act.

07:53.462 --> 07:54.845
Okay, so what's the problem?

07:54.847 --> 07:57.214
Well, since this will be
his third strike,

07:57.216 --> 08:00.434
I reviewed Devereaux's other
two violent felony convictions.

08:00.436 --> 08:01.635
And?

08:01.637 --> 08:02.603
The first one's solid.

08:02.605 --> 08:05.723
The second case
was six years ago.

08:08.259 --> 08:09.894
I found some relevant evidence

08:09.896 --> 08:11.812
the prosecutor never put
on the record.

08:11.814 --> 08:14.114
Well, that's a very
serious charge.

08:14.116 --> 08:16.283
I know,
but when I nail Devereaux,

08:16.285 --> 08:18.485
with one prior,
he's looking at ten years.

08:18.487 --> 08:21.572
Under three strikes,
it's 25 to life.

08:21.574 --> 08:23.540
All right, I'll take a look.

08:23.542 --> 08:25.910
Who was the prosecutor
on the case?

08:27.000 --> 08:33.073
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

08:39.624 --> 08:41.225
What do we got?

08:41.227 --> 08:43.594
30-year-old male,
took one in the head.

08:43.596 --> 08:45.930
All right.

08:45.932 --> 08:48.849
Step back.

08:50.602 --> 08:51.819
Son of a bitch.

08:51.821 --> 08:53.136
Tell me it's not Billy Chin.

08:53.138 --> 08:54.638
Yeah, Billy Chin.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.573
Great.
First he lawyers up on us,

08:56.575 --> 08:58.525
now he winds up with one
in the back of the head?

08:58.527 --> 09:00.143
Yeah, what do you want to bet
the round

09:00.145 --> 09:02.279
matches the one they pulled
out of his pal last night, too?

09:02.281 --> 09:04.147
You think our shooter
took him out?

09:04.149 --> 09:05.416
Well, he's a pro.

09:05.418 --> 09:07.317
Takes out Billy Chin here
so he can't I.D. him,

09:07.319 --> 09:09.036
and dumps his body
in the Financial District

09:09.038 --> 09:10.821
so all his pals can see.

09:10.823 --> 09:12.206
I'd say he's sending a message.

09:12.208 --> 09:14.708
Jared Mehra-- we
thinking he's next?

09:14.710 --> 09:16.710
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he's on the list.

09:16.712 --> 09:18.929
Where are you with our
perp in the hospital?

09:18.931 --> 09:20.431
He was back in
for a second surgery.

09:20.433 --> 09:22.683
They're gonna call me
as soon as we can talk to him.

09:22.685 --> 09:25.135
Bodies are piling up; we need
an I.D. on this shooter.

09:25.137 --> 09:27.170
Believe me, I know that.

09:28.139 --> 09:29.640
Let's get out of here.

09:33.511 --> 09:36.113
Just one pretzel,
no mustard, okay?

09:36.115 --> 09:38.032
You got it.

09:38.034 --> 09:39.700
Hey, how's
your homicide?

09:39.702 --> 09:41.452
Turned into a doubleheader.

09:41.454 --> 09:42.486
Thanks.

09:42.488 --> 09:44.488
You know who you're chasing?
No.

09:44.490 --> 09:47.074
My only witness is currently
in surgery at St. Vic's.

09:47.076 --> 09:48.876
Oh, can Linda help you
get to him?

09:48.878 --> 09:50.995
Linda? You know, I thought
she would've helped me,

09:50.997 --> 09:52.579
but she shut me down.
Oh.

09:52.581 --> 09:55.416
Anyway, look, that's not why
I asked to meet with you.

09:55.418 --> 09:57.167
I got-- I need a
really big favor.

09:57.169 --> 09:59.670
You know the Bay Ridge
Derby is coming up,

09:59.672 --> 10:01.388
and I'm supposed
to help Sean.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.173
I'm kind of stuck
with this case.

10:03.175 --> 10:04.842
It's killing me, but
I can't help him.

10:04.844 --> 10:06.510
I can do it.
You sure?

10:06.512 --> 10:08.979
Yeah, yeah, get him signed up,
help him build the car.

10:08.981 --> 10:10.347
It'll be fun; no problem.

10:10.349 --> 10:12.850
Whoa, whoa. If he loses,
it's gonna be a big problem.

10:12.852 --> 10:15.385
I mean, this is a serious
family tradition, kid.

10:15.387 --> 10:16.737
Dad won, I
won, Joe won.

10:16.739 --> 10:17.771
I won.
Right.

10:17.773 --> 10:18.989
Hey, don't worry,
I got it.

10:18.991 --> 10:20.357
(cell phone rings)
You sure?

10:20.359 --> 10:22.409
Yeah. Be fun.

10:23.561 --> 10:25.279
Linda.

10:25.281 --> 10:27.331
She's finally gonna let
me talk to my suspect.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.066
Um, all right,
I got to go.

10:29.068 --> 10:30.233
The derby.

10:30.235 --> 10:32.169
All right.
All right, don't mess it up, kid.

10:32.171 --> 10:33.454
I'm counting on you.
Got it.

10:33.456 --> 10:35.072
But at the end
of the day,

10:35.074 --> 10:36.707
this case goes to
trial in Manhattan.

10:36.709 --> 10:37.741
I got to run.

10:37.743 --> 10:39.626
(sighs)

10:39.628 --> 10:41.428
My counterpart in Brooklyn.

10:41.430 --> 10:43.747
He's trying to jump
our serial arson case.

10:43.749 --> 10:45.966
I'll burn his house down first.

10:47.018 --> 10:48.585
How's the new gig?

10:48.587 --> 10:50.604
So far, so good.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.557
We're prosecuting
a sex offender,

10:53.559 --> 10:55.476
Wayne Devereaux.

10:55.478 --> 10:57.061
Elderly victim.

10:57.063 --> 10:58.262
Does it ring a bell?

10:58.264 --> 10:59.279
Not yet.

10:59.281 --> 11:02.032
Well, the guy's got two strikes.

11:02.034 --> 11:04.034
You gave him his second.

11:05.787 --> 11:08.989
Oh, yeah, I remember
this son of a bitch.

11:08.991 --> 11:12.376
Raped a 70-year-old grandmother
on her way home from the market.

11:12.378 --> 11:14.995
Yeah. When our A.D.A.
ran the case,

11:14.997 --> 11:18.165
she found a D.O.T. video
that you subpoenaed.

11:18.167 --> 11:20.634
It shows Devereaux's car
running a red light

11:20.636 --> 11:22.419
in East Village at the same time

11:22.421 --> 11:24.721
the victim was being assaulted
on the Upper West Side.

11:24.723 --> 11:27.591
I remember ordering the video,
but I never watched it.

11:27.593 --> 11:28.725
Why not?

11:28.727 --> 11:32.062
The victim picked Devereaux
out of a lineup,

11:32.064 --> 11:33.764
along with
two sanitation workers

11:33.766 --> 11:35.399
who pulled him
off her.

11:35.401 --> 11:38.185
Prior conviction, same M.O.--
I didn't need the tape.

11:38.187 --> 11:39.319
I had him cold.

11:39.321 --> 11:40.320
You watch it?

11:40.322 --> 11:42.022
Yeah, it's Devereaux's car,

11:42.024 --> 11:43.907
but you can't make out
the driver's face.

11:43.909 --> 11:45.109
Well, it couldn't have
been Devereaux.

11:45.111 --> 11:47.161
Who's the A.D.A.?
Rachel Manning.

11:47.163 --> 11:49.113
I'll watch the tape.
I'll straighten it out.

11:49.115 --> 11:51.331
Thank you, Amanda.

11:53.251 --> 11:55.035
Hey.

11:57.255 --> 11:58.755
Can I talk
to Christopher Dean now?

11:58.757 --> 11:59.823
I'm afraid not.

11:59.825 --> 12:01.992
Why not?

12:01.994 --> 12:03.510
You operated
on the guy twice.

12:03.512 --> 12:05.879
What is it now,
a heart transplant?

12:05.881 --> 12:07.131
No, Danny.

12:07.133 --> 12:08.298
Well, why can't I interview him?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.667
Because he's dead.

12:11.886 --> 12:14.688
He died, ten minutes
after I texted you.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.608
Complications from
the second surgery.

12:17.610 --> 12:19.643
I'm sorry.

12:19.645 --> 12:21.612
"Sorry."

12:21.614 --> 12:23.447
Sorry will be

12:23.449 --> 12:26.150
when the next bodies
come pouring through here.

12:39.941 --> 12:41.108
Hey, there.

12:41.110 --> 12:42.876
Hey.

12:42.878 --> 12:44.912
Did Amanda talk to you
about the Devereaux case?

12:44.914 --> 12:46.046
Yes.

12:46.048 --> 12:49.533
So, is she going
to have the case reviewed

12:49.535 --> 12:51.368
based on the traffic video?

12:51.370 --> 12:54.621
Amanda's comfortable with
the conviction as it stands.

12:54.623 --> 12:55.756
Did she say that?

12:55.758 --> 12:57.675
In no uncertain terms.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.561
Look, I was hoping you could
take me off the case.

13:00.563 --> 13:03.681
You want someone to take over
Devereaux's current rape trial?

13:03.683 --> 13:07.067
I'm just not comfortable,
under the circumstances.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.821
Uh, I should get back to work.

13:16.278 --> 13:19.313
Man, they've added a lot
of rules since I raced.

13:19.315 --> 13:22.032
Can we get
some ice cream?

13:22.034 --> 13:24.418
Yeah, as soon as
we get registered, bud.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.870
Are you excited to carry on
the Reagan family dynasty?

13:26.872 --> 13:29.039
I guess.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.258
I'm gonna go say hi
to my friend Ethan.

13:31.260 --> 13:32.459
Okay.

13:35.764 --> 13:36.930
Hi.

13:36.932 --> 13:39.350
Oh, hey.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.468
Didn't know you had
a kid, Reagan.

13:41.470 --> 13:42.970
He's Danny's son.

13:42.972 --> 13:44.188
What's up, Larry?

13:44.190 --> 13:47.674
15 years with FDNY,
just made lieutenant.

13:47.676 --> 13:49.693
I hear you're still
stuck on the beat.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.012
Yeah, well, law school
set me back a few years.

13:52.014 --> 13:54.531
So, it's the Reagans

13:54.533 --> 13:56.533
and Bonniellos going at it
on the hill.

13:56.535 --> 13:57.901
Just like old times.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.119
I was trying to remember.

13:59.121 --> 14:00.654
Have you guys ever
actually beaten us?

14:00.656 --> 14:01.905
I wouldn't get too cocky.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.857
I remember the year
you took on Danny.

14:03.859 --> 14:06.710
That race was really...
not close, actually.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.245
Your brother took
a rolling start.

14:08.247 --> 14:10.331
Yeah, well, that's not
what the judges said.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.333
MAN: Next. Can I see
your release forms?

14:12.335 --> 14:14.534
But, hey, uh, that was
a long time ago, right?

14:14.536 --> 14:16.670
It's all about the kids
having fun here.

14:16.672 --> 14:18.389
Ethan! We're out of here.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.808
We're in it to win it
this year, Reagan.

14:20.810 --> 14:23.143
Well, God knows
you guys are due.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.571
Did you ever have a
suspect dead to rights,

14:34.573 --> 14:37.107
and look the other way
on a piece of evidence

14:37.109 --> 14:38.742
that might have
let him walk?

14:38.744 --> 14:40.727
As Commissioner, no way.

14:40.729 --> 14:42.279
Not ethical. Slippery slope.

14:42.281 --> 14:43.614
As a cop?

14:44.983 --> 14:46.417
Don't ask.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.919
That's not an answer.

14:52.857 --> 14:57.244
If I ever did,
it would've been a mistake.

14:57.246 --> 14:59.012
This about your new job?

14:59.014 --> 15:02.466
Don't ask.

15:05.053 --> 15:07.921
Got it.

15:07.923 --> 15:12.943
It's one of the toughest things
a cop has to wrestle with.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.478
Prosecutors, too.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.614
But isn't there a gray area

15:17.616 --> 15:20.951
when someone can do the wrong
thing for the right reasons?

15:22.821 --> 15:25.472
Sometimes we have to pay a price
for our ethics.

15:25.474 --> 15:27.791
But we either pay for them
or with them.

15:27.793 --> 15:30.160
If you're trying
to make this easier,

15:30.162 --> 15:33.247
can you just try
a little harder?

15:36.084 --> 15:37.134
(sighs)

15:37.136 --> 15:39.219
Your head sits well
on your shoulders,

15:39.221 --> 15:42.473
and your heart's
in the right place.

15:42.475 --> 15:46.510
When the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

15:49.130 --> 15:50.681
(sighs)

15:51.516 --> 15:54.985
Hey, look what
the cat dragged in.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.653
How's it going, Jared?

15:56.655 --> 15:58.655
(sighs)

15:58.657 --> 16:00.407
How you think it's going?

16:01.976 --> 16:03.277
Crazy bastard killed Billy.

16:03.279 --> 16:05.496
I want to make it
perfectly clear that I advised

16:05.498 --> 16:06.980
my client
not to speak to you.

16:06.982 --> 16:09.149
He's worried about a damn
drug charge, I'm about to get

16:09.151 --> 16:10.317
a bullet in my brain.

16:10.319 --> 16:11.485
Yeah, he's right, Counselor.

16:11.487 --> 16:13.170
You'll probably make
a lot more dough off him

16:13.172 --> 16:15.022
if you keep him alive.

16:15.024 --> 16:16.957
Okay, what do you want
to talk about?

16:16.959 --> 16:18.792
Hello!

16:18.794 --> 16:21.512
I need you guys to keep me
from getting killed.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.846
Oh.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.349
It'd be a lot easier if we knew
who we were looking for.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.718
I've been buying from
Christopher for two years.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.852
Though we are not admitting

16:28.854 --> 16:30.554
to the purchase or the use
of illicit drugs.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.574
Will you shut
up, Alan?!

16:35.693 --> 16:38.845
So, up until now, everything,
everything has been cool.

16:38.847 --> 16:40.147
Yeah, well,
it's not cool anymore.

16:40.149 --> 16:41.482
Christopher Dean is dead,

16:41.484 --> 16:43.850
so why don't you tell us
something we don't know.

16:46.287 --> 16:49.206
We went to that new guy's place
a couple months ago

16:49.208 --> 16:51.492
to-to pick up some stuff.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.794
He's a... complete freak show.

16:53.796 --> 16:55.295
We need a name, Jared.

16:55.297 --> 16:56.580
You guys gonna protect me?

16:56.582 --> 16:59.299
The quicker we catch him,
the safer you'll be.

17:02.136 --> 17:04.838
His name's, uh, Tommy Banks.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.373
Tommy Banks.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.375
He's new in town,
from Chicago, I think.

17:08.377 --> 17:10.176
That explains why
no one knows the guy.

17:10.179 --> 17:12.045
Yeah, okay.

17:12.047 --> 17:13.981
You gave us the name.

17:13.983 --> 17:15.566
Give us an address.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.230
Anything?
Nothing here.

17:30.232 --> 17:32.115
Clear.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.900
(sighs)
Nobody home.

17:33.902 --> 17:36.503
Let's go.

17:38.806 --> 17:39.790
Detectives.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.342
Hey, what's his story?

17:42.344 --> 17:43.760
This guy's the
superintendent.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.245
Oh, yeah? We're looking
for Tommy Banks.

17:45.247 --> 17:46.763
When's the last
time you saw him?

17:46.765 --> 17:48.549
It's been a few days.

17:48.551 --> 17:50.884
Does he have any friends
in the building?

17:50.886 --> 17:52.719
I doubt it. The guy's bad news.

17:52.721 --> 17:54.021
Everybody keeps their distance.

17:54.023 --> 17:55.639
All right, look,
we're investigating a homicide.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.641
It's important we find Tommy,
you understand?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.643
I ran into his girlfriend once.

17:59.645 --> 18:00.777
She was bringing him

18:00.779 --> 18:02.646
some food.
She got a name?

18:02.648 --> 18:05.315
Something with an "S."

18:05.317 --> 18:06.700
Uh, Sally...

18:06.702 --> 18:08.368
Sheri. Sheri something.

18:08.370 --> 18:10.203
Sheri something. Beautiful.

18:10.205 --> 18:13.290
Let's go find
Sheri something.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.774
AMANDA:
Well, I'm fortunate

18:14.776 --> 18:16.460
to have an extremely
talented team

18:16.462 --> 18:18.211
of prosecutors who
make me look good.

18:18.213 --> 18:20.213
Your name has been mentioned
as a candidate

18:20.215 --> 18:21.448
for district attorney.

18:21.450 --> 18:25.135
That's flattering,
but I am happy where I am.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.786
I'm sorry. Duty calls.

18:29.023 --> 18:31.491
Did I sound adequately
humble and magnanimous?

18:31.493 --> 18:33.026
Yes.

18:33.028 --> 18:36.680
It's too bad you didn't save
any of that for Rachel Manning.

18:37.798 --> 18:39.266
What happened?

18:39.268 --> 18:41.485
I reviewed
the traffic tape.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.070
Like you said,
it was inconclusive

18:43.072 --> 18:44.821
as to who was
driving the car.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.490
It wouldn't have
changed the verdict.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.226
You can't know that.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.144
Devereaux's lawyer
should've had the tape,

18:51.146 --> 18:54.147
and the jurors should've
been able to weigh its value.

18:54.149 --> 18:59.119
This guy is a recidivist rapist
who preys on senior citizens.

18:59.121 --> 19:00.420
I know.

19:00.422 --> 19:02.656
Then you also know
that despite having

19:02.658 --> 19:04.174
this sick bastard
dead to rights,

19:04.176 --> 19:07.427
that tape could've swayed some
idiot juror to let him walk.

19:07.429 --> 19:10.931
I thought you said you
didn't watch the video.

19:14.669 --> 19:17.187
A subordinate came to you
with an issue.

19:17.189 --> 19:20.190
You passed it up to me,
and I made my call.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.692
Let's move on.

19:23.778 --> 19:25.612
(clears throat)

19:27.365 --> 19:30.784
You know, Erin, it was not easy
getting to where I am.

19:30.786 --> 19:33.320
But you know how I did it?

19:33.322 --> 19:38.075
In every job along the way,
I made myself indispensable.

19:38.077 --> 19:41.578
I had the boss's back, and they
knew they could count on me.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.580
And now that I'm the boss,

19:43.582 --> 19:45.582
I'm looking for people
I can count on.

19:45.584 --> 19:48.919
People who want a future
in this office.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.637
People like you, Erin.

19:51.639 --> 19:55.142
That is why I put you
on my team.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.353
Sean?

20:06.355 --> 20:08.054
Plain or pepperoni?

20:08.056 --> 20:09.606
Surprise me.

20:09.608 --> 20:10.857
Thanks, buddy.

20:10.859 --> 20:12.075
How's your case going?

20:12.077 --> 20:14.528
I.D.'d the shooter, finally.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.196
That's good news.

20:16.198 --> 20:17.330
Oh, yeah, great.

20:17.332 --> 20:20.233
So, you think you'll
be able to track him down?

20:20.235 --> 20:22.452
Thought you didn't care
about that.

20:22.454 --> 20:25.872
Come on, Danny.

20:25.874 --> 20:27.257
I know you're pissed at me,

20:27.259 --> 20:29.926
but why don't you just say
what you got to say.

20:31.262 --> 20:32.879
'Cause it's not gonna
change anything.

20:32.881 --> 20:36.967
Well... might make you
feel better.

20:36.969 --> 20:37.934
Really?

20:37.936 --> 20:39.386
Talking about how my wife

20:39.388 --> 20:41.755
protected a murderer's
supposed to make me feel better?

20:41.757 --> 20:42.873
That's not fair.

20:44.058 --> 20:45.692
But it's true.

20:46.527 --> 20:49.095
Sean, let's go up.

20:49.097 --> 20:50.313
LINDA:
Upstairs.

20:50.315 --> 20:51.398
Finish your homework.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.316
(sighs)

20:53.318 --> 20:55.035
You know what's true?

20:55.037 --> 20:57.954
Is you think that what you do is
more important than what I do.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.105
I never said that.

20:59.107 --> 21:00.607
You didn't have to.

21:00.609 --> 21:01.908
I never said that!

21:04.779 --> 21:06.630
(sighs)

21:06.632 --> 21:08.665
Danny, you...

21:08.667 --> 21:12.219
you put your life
on the line every day, 24/7.

21:12.221 --> 21:14.287
You save lives.

21:14.289 --> 21:15.555
You do.

21:15.557 --> 21:17.507
But I save lives, too.

21:18.559 --> 21:20.143
When you bust into my E.R.

21:20.145 --> 21:22.229
and ask me to put
a life in jeopardy

21:22.231 --> 21:25.348
for the sake of your case,
you know what you're saying?

21:25.350 --> 21:27.100
You're saying your way
of saving lives

21:27.102 --> 21:29.853
takes priority over my way,
and it doesn't.

21:29.855 --> 21:30.970
You know what?

21:30.972 --> 21:32.656
I didn't bust into
your E.R., Linda.

21:32.658 --> 21:34.307
I walked in!

21:34.309 --> 21:36.910
I walked in, and I asked you
to help me keep more people

21:36.912 --> 21:38.745
from getting killed by a maniac!

21:38.747 --> 21:41.147
Who shot up the Meatpacking
District with an Uzi!

21:41.149 --> 21:42.315
Well, I did my job.

21:42.317 --> 21:44.334
And I would do it again
in a second.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.953
I did my job, too,
and I'd do it again in a second.

21:46.955 --> 21:47.954
You know, Danny,

21:47.956 --> 21:49.589
you're being
such a jerk about this,

21:49.591 --> 21:50.874
and I'm sick of it!

21:50.876 --> 21:52.175
Good.

21:52.177 --> 21:53.827
Then maybe that's my cue to go.

21:53.829 --> 21:56.046
What? What did you say?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.547
I said I'm leaving.

21:59.767 --> 22:01.468
(door opens, closes)

22:17.805 --> 22:20.022
(sighs)

22:23.860 --> 22:25.444
There's coffee
in the kitchen.

22:25.446 --> 22:27.146
I think it's still hot.

22:28.064 --> 22:30.699
Oh.

22:30.701 --> 22:32.368
Hey.

22:34.237 --> 22:35.988
(grunts)

22:35.990 --> 22:38.374
Why didn't you just
go up to your old room?

22:38.376 --> 22:40.542
I didn't want to wake you.

22:41.544 --> 22:43.111
I know; so much for that.

22:43.113 --> 22:46.966
Once I knew you were coming,
I couldn't sleep.

22:46.968 --> 22:49.084
It's a dad thing.

22:49.086 --> 22:51.453
Yeah.

22:51.455 --> 22:54.473
Yeah, I got the broad strokes.

22:54.475 --> 22:55.791
Tough situation.

22:55.793 --> 22:57.626
Didn't have to be.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.062
I needed 30 seconds
with the guy, Dad.

23:00.064 --> 23:02.097
She did what she thought
was right.

23:02.099 --> 23:03.349
Are we taking sides?

23:03.351 --> 23:06.235
Nope. You two are gonna
have to hash this out.

23:06.237 --> 23:07.686
Well, that may take a while.

23:09.572 --> 23:11.523
Look, we both know how you get

23:11.525 --> 23:13.475
when you're
working a tough case.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.327
So...?

23:15.329 --> 23:18.197
So... just remember

23:18.199 --> 23:21.200
that this time,
she's got a case, too.

23:21.202 --> 23:23.652
(sighs)

23:27.424 --> 23:28.824
I got a tour.

23:28.826 --> 23:30.492
I'm gonna get ready and go.

23:30.494 --> 23:33.379
Jamie's doing a
great job with Sean.

23:33.381 --> 23:36.432
Yeah, I'd love to be part of it.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.162
HENRY:
<i>Your Uncle Jamie</i>

23:50.164 --> 23:52.698
tells me that you're pals
with the Bonniello kid.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.650
Ethan? Yeah,
he's a cool guy.

23:54.652 --> 23:57.202
Just remember, when you're
up there on the hill,

23:57.204 --> 23:58.854
it's not about
friendship.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.956
It's every man for himself.

24:00.958 --> 24:03.158
Come on, Henry,
this is just a kids' race.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.210
It's not the Daytona 500.

24:05.212 --> 24:07.362
Sean just wants
to have fun.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.048
Winning is fun.
Yeah.

24:09.050 --> 24:10.966
As long as you play
by the rules, right, Sean?

24:10.968 --> 24:12.751
You guys are so full of it.

24:12.753 --> 24:15.370
This is all about
beating the Bonniellos.

24:15.372 --> 24:17.673
Isn't that feud,
like, 100 years old?

24:17.675 --> 24:20.309
It is not a feud,
it is a tradition.

24:20.311 --> 24:21.593
In which we run

24:21.595 --> 24:24.646
roughshod over those
hose-dragging hydrant suckers

24:24.648 --> 24:26.882
till they cry like little girls.

24:26.884 --> 24:28.150
(door closes)

24:30.019 --> 24:31.019
(clears throat)

24:31.021 --> 24:33.439
JAMIE:
Hey.

24:33.441 --> 24:35.491
Hey.
I made you a plate, Dad.

24:35.493 --> 24:37.659
Thanks, kid.
Sorry I'm late.

24:37.661 --> 24:38.861
Any luck with your shooter?

24:38.863 --> 24:40.779
Nope, still in the wind.

24:40.781 --> 24:43.532
48 hours trying to I.D.
his girlfriend, and nothing.

24:43.534 --> 24:44.783
You'll get him.

24:44.785 --> 24:48.537
Yeah, well, case is
getting colder by the day.

24:48.539 --> 24:50.506
Is that Mom's fault?

24:50.508 --> 24:51.507
(scoffs softly)

24:51.509 --> 24:53.125
I wonder where he got that idea.

24:53.127 --> 24:56.011
No, Sean, it's not
your mother's fault.

24:56.013 --> 24:57.463
Well, that's nice to hear.

24:57.465 --> 24:58.964
You really believe that?

25:01.551 --> 25:02.918
I do. Big difference between

25:02.920 --> 25:04.636
medical decisions
and police decisions.

25:04.638 --> 25:07.473
But this guy is partially
responsible for a murder, right?

25:07.475 --> 25:11.643
Allegedly, people are innocent
until proven guilty.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.364
But Danny saw this happen
with his own two eyes.

25:15.366 --> 25:17.032
Maybe we should
leave this alone.

25:17.034 --> 25:18.767
Oh.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.819
You really think
that doctors and nurses

25:20.821 --> 25:22.905
should choose who gets
good care and who doesn't?

25:22.907 --> 25:24.823
No, but I don't
think they should

25:24.825 --> 25:26.875
put other people's
lives at risk either.

25:26.877 --> 25:29.278
Do no harm and
all that garbage.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.712
(scoffs)

25:30.714 --> 25:31.964
It's dangerous though, Danny.

25:31.966 --> 25:33.782
I mean, you're asking
the hospital to play God.

25:33.784 --> 25:35.784
I don't know
if it's so black and white.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.954
I mean, we all have jobs

25:38.956 --> 25:40.973
where people's lives
hang in the balance.

25:40.975 --> 25:44.343
We have to make decisions
that do the most good.

25:44.345 --> 25:46.127
That's sounds like
a rationalization

25:46.129 --> 25:47.963
against doing
what you know is right.

25:47.965 --> 25:49.848
My job is

25:49.850 --> 25:51.683
to keep the patient alive.

25:51.685 --> 25:52.601
Period.

25:52.603 --> 25:54.236
HENRY:
My two cents:

25:54.238 --> 25:56.905
if a guy sells poison
on the streets,

25:56.907 --> 25:58.440
he deserves what he gets.

25:58.442 --> 26:01.660
Maybe so, but it takes guts
to stand by your principles.

26:01.662 --> 26:05.030
Not just when it's easy, but
when it can cost you something.

26:07.534 --> 26:09.618
Thank you.

26:09.620 --> 26:12.254
Okay, then, Dad,
if it were you at the hospital

26:12.256 --> 26:15.457
when I showed up, would you have
let me talk to the guy?

26:20.647 --> 26:23.498
Pass the potatoes.

26:29.105 --> 26:32.357
FRANK:
Pop?

26:32.359 --> 26:34.276
What's going on?

26:34.278 --> 26:37.980
Well, the Henry Special
is almost good to go.

26:37.982 --> 26:41.083
Yeah, Jamie and Sean
did a great job, didn't they?

26:41.085 --> 26:42.618
Mm.

26:42.620 --> 26:44.870
Course, they didn't teach them
about the finer points

26:44.872 --> 26:46.521
of derby racing at Harvard.

26:46.523 --> 26:47.990
The finer points?

26:47.992 --> 26:53.212
Sliding weight in the nose,
a little give in the seat.

26:54.063 --> 26:56.197
That would be cheating, Pop.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.216
Relax.

26:57.218 --> 26:58.884
The car will pass inspection.

26:58.886 --> 27:01.503
We'll just have
a competitive edge.

27:03.089 --> 27:06.225
That's what's special
about the Henry Special.

27:06.227 --> 27:08.677
You gonna tell Sean?

27:08.679 --> 27:09.661
Course not.

27:09.663 --> 27:11.647
He needs to have
plausible deniability.

27:11.649 --> 27:13.265
Just like you did.

27:15.151 --> 27:16.935
What are you talking about?

27:16.937 --> 27:18.987
What, you think
we beat the Bonniellos

27:18.989 --> 27:22.274
every year on our charm
and good looks?

27:24.160 --> 27:26.161
Pop.

27:26.163 --> 27:29.615
Those bastards pushed the
envelope just as much as we did.

27:29.617 --> 27:31.783
Well, it doesn't
make it right.

27:31.785 --> 27:33.919
(clears throat)

27:33.921 --> 27:36.922
I slept with
this trophy for a week.

27:36.924 --> 27:40.926
All's fair in love...
and derby racing.

27:40.928 --> 27:43.462
To hold a grudge
over a stupid race...

27:43.464 --> 27:45.547
It goes much deeper than that.

27:45.549 --> 27:47.549
Sal Bonniello
picked a fight with me,

27:47.551 --> 27:50.969
I chipped a tooth, and
I'm the one who got grounded.

27:50.971 --> 27:52.888
How old were you?

27:52.890 --> 27:55.090
I was seven.

27:58.861 --> 28:01.613
♪

28:19.281 --> 28:20.782
(quiet clatter)

28:23.820 --> 28:26.555
(whispering): It's okay.
I blacked out the windows.

28:26.557 --> 28:28.256
Turn on the lights.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.645
You bring the
rule book?

28:33.647 --> 28:35.681
Yeah, I got it.

28:35.683 --> 28:37.399
So, uh, what's up?

28:39.936 --> 28:42.771
There's no easy way to say this.

28:42.773 --> 28:44.973
Henry Special's juiced.

28:44.975 --> 28:46.441
What are you talking about?

28:46.443 --> 28:49.310
Your grandpa
made a few adjustments.

28:49.312 --> 28:51.863
He rigged the car?

28:52.582 --> 28:53.615
Why would he do that?

28:53.617 --> 28:54.649
Because he got grounded

28:54.651 --> 28:55.984
when he was seven.

28:55.986 --> 28:57.085
Come again?

28:57.087 --> 28:58.036
(sighs)

28:58.038 --> 28:59.421
It's gonna be a long night.

28:59.423 --> 29:01.423
Well, what are we gonna do?

29:01.425 --> 29:04.826
Level the playing field.

29:10.233 --> 29:12.167
All right,
what do you got, Baez?

29:12.169 --> 29:14.369
BAEZ: May finally have something
on Sheri the girlfriend.

29:14.371 --> 29:15.570
Yeah? Talk to me.

29:15.572 --> 29:17.773
I took a flier and checked in
with the hospital

29:17.775 --> 29:19.641
to see who claimed
Christopher Dean's body.

29:19.643 --> 29:21.476
His sister sent
a funeral director

29:21.478 --> 29:23.362
to sign for him this morning.

29:23.364 --> 29:24.730
And?

29:24.732 --> 29:26.865
Sister's name is Sheri Dean.

29:26.867 --> 29:28.183
Bingo. You check her out?

29:28.185 --> 29:30.351
Yeah, she's got a place
in the East Village.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.871
Management says she signed
a lease about three months ago.

29:32.873 --> 29:34.856
Came in from Chicago.

29:34.858 --> 29:36.992
All right, look, I'm about
five minutes from the Village.

29:36.994 --> 29:39.194
Text me an address,
grab my rain jacket and vest,

29:39.196 --> 29:40.712
I'll meet you there.
Okay.

29:40.714 --> 29:42.998
Hey, don't go in
until I get there.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.205
Hi. You have a second?

29:50.207 --> 29:51.823
Come on in.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.712
(sighs)

29:57.714 --> 30:00.548
I'm not sure I ever
expressed how grateful I am

30:00.550 --> 30:02.350
for the opportunity
you've given me.

30:02.352 --> 30:03.935
Oh, that's not necessary.

30:03.937 --> 30:06.438
No, it-it is.

30:06.440 --> 30:10.158
I mean, for a long time,
I've just kept my head down.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.911
Prosecuted my cases,
raised my daughter,

30:12.913 --> 30:15.730
never really gave a thought
to my future.

30:15.732 --> 30:19.284
Nicky's gonna be
going to college soon.

30:19.286 --> 30:21.870
I'm gonna be on my own.

30:21.872 --> 30:26.124
So, when this promotion
came along, I thought,

30:26.126 --> 30:30.545
yeah, maybe it's okay to be
thinking about my career again.

30:30.547 --> 30:33.265
You have all the talent
in the world, Erin.

30:33.267 --> 30:35.250
Together we could run
this place.

30:35.252 --> 30:36.852
I would like that.

30:38.554 --> 30:41.807
But... (clears throat)

30:41.809 --> 30:45.310
none of that is really relevant

30:45.312 --> 30:47.729
to the Devereaux case.

30:49.065 --> 30:52.567
If we break the rules
to put the bad guys away,

30:52.569 --> 30:55.403
that makes us the bad guys.

30:55.405 --> 30:57.889
That's really moving.

30:57.891 --> 30:59.875
And incredibly naive.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.830
I trust the system
to decide guilt or innocence

31:04.832 --> 31:07.082
without putting my thumb
on the scale.

31:07.084 --> 31:10.051
If that makes me naive,
then so be it.

31:10.053 --> 31:12.554
You might want
to think about this.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.457
Do you really want
to take me on?

31:16.459 --> 31:18.894
You're not leaving me a choice.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.147
Now, you are either
going to take that tape

31:22.149 --> 31:24.182
to the judge, or I am.

31:24.184 --> 31:25.984
And know this:

31:25.986 --> 31:29.437
you can do
whatever you want to me,

31:29.439 --> 31:31.973
but if you go after
Rachel Manning,

31:31.975 --> 31:33.825
I will take
this whole thing public.

31:33.827 --> 31:36.477
And I don't think that's
a scandal you want to face.

31:36.479 --> 31:40.615
I figured
you could play hardball.

31:40.617 --> 31:43.318
I just hoped
we'd be on the same team.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.036
That's up to you.

31:50.877 --> 31:53.428
(door closes)

32:00.897 --> 32:02.581
(knocking)

32:06.779 --> 32:07.829
Sheri Dean?

32:07.831 --> 32:10.248
Yeah? Wh-What's going on?

32:10.250 --> 32:11.883
I'm Detective Reagan.

32:11.885 --> 32:13.618
You Tommy Banks'
girlfriend?

32:13.620 --> 32:15.187
I know Tommy.

32:15.189 --> 32:18.173
Uh-huh.

32:18.175 --> 32:19.658
Is Tommy here now?

32:19.660 --> 32:21.376
No.

32:21.378 --> 32:23.578
You mind if I come in?

32:23.580 --> 32:25.881
No.

32:25.883 --> 32:28.767
Okay.

32:34.056 --> 32:36.274
You know
where Tommy is now?

32:36.276 --> 32:37.859
Uh, no.

32:37.861 --> 32:39.761
No?

32:39.763 --> 32:41.813
When's the last time
you saw him?

32:41.815 --> 32:43.615
Uh, couple days?

32:43.617 --> 32:44.900
He comes and goes.

32:44.902 --> 32:46.568
Right.

32:46.570 --> 32:49.905
You know Tommy's the reason
why your brother's dead, right?

32:51.023 --> 32:53.775
He's a bad guy, Sheri.

32:53.777 --> 32:56.545
He's hurt a lot of people, and,
uh, he's gonna hurt you, too.

32:56.547 --> 33:01.166
Look, I already told you,
I-I don't know...

33:01.168 --> 33:03.618
where he is.

33:06.839 --> 33:10.842
You know that I'm paid to know
when I'm being lied to, right?

33:12.795 --> 33:15.096
Hmm?

33:15.098 --> 33:17.933
I'm pretty sure that's what's
happening to me right now.

33:17.935 --> 33:19.734
(gunshot, Sheri screams)

33:20.570 --> 33:23.321
Stay there!

33:24.607 --> 33:25.473
(gasps)

33:29.245 --> 33:30.529
Stay down!

33:38.588 --> 33:39.871
Stop it, Tommy!

33:44.544 --> 33:47.495
(gun clicks empty)

33:47.497 --> 33:50.832
Give it up, Tommy!

33:50.834 --> 33:52.434
You hear me?!

33:52.436 --> 33:53.802
Come and get me, cop!

33:53.804 --> 33:56.021
DANNY:
You're not getting out of here!

34:13.489 --> 34:15.706
(grunting)

34:16.859 --> 34:17.826
(gasps)

34:25.635 --> 34:27.135
(groans)

34:34.710 --> 34:36.561
(grunting)

34:51.077 --> 34:54.395
(straining)

34:56.666 --> 34:58.500
Banks!

34:58.502 --> 35:00.619
Drop your hands!

35:02.705 --> 35:04.923
Banks, I will shoot!
Drop your hands!

35:04.925 --> 35:06.925
(grunting)

35:06.927 --> 35:09.094
(panting)

35:09.096 --> 35:10.795
I told you to wait for me.

35:12.381 --> 35:14.582
I forgot.

35:16.269 --> 35:18.386
You wanted to see me?

35:18.388 --> 35:19.554
Come in, Rachel.

35:28.364 --> 35:29.981
Your request to be transferred

35:29.983 --> 35:31.983
off the Devereaux case
has been denied.

35:31.985 --> 35:33.434
May I ask why?

35:33.436 --> 35:36.454
When you start a case
around here, you finish it.

35:36.456 --> 35:37.822
And the traffic video?

35:37.824 --> 35:40.992
I've contacted the judge
in that case.

35:40.994 --> 35:42.460
The conviction is under review.

35:42.462 --> 35:44.262
The matter
will be resolved

35:44.264 --> 35:47.299
before Devereaux is sentenced
in your case.

35:47.301 --> 35:49.283
Provided, of course,
you get a conviction.

35:49.285 --> 35:51.619
I will.

35:51.621 --> 35:53.171
Thank you.

36:04.016 --> 36:06.467
So should I be
packing my things?

36:06.469 --> 36:09.070
You ignored
the chain of command.

36:09.072 --> 36:11.323
You defied
my explicit instructions

36:11.325 --> 36:12.991
to drop this matter.

36:12.993 --> 36:16.144
And then you threatened
to call me out in public.

36:16.146 --> 36:18.530
That's true.

36:20.783 --> 36:23.651
You're arrogant
and self-righteous.

36:23.653 --> 36:26.004
Also true.

36:27.456 --> 36:30.125
And you also happen to be
the only person in this office

36:30.127 --> 36:32.761
I can trust to call me out
when I cross the line.

36:32.763 --> 36:36.014
You sure that's something
you want?

36:36.016 --> 36:38.216
No.

36:42.388 --> 36:44.672
But it may be something need.

36:47.893 --> 36:50.028
(sighs)

36:53.799 --> 36:56.034
♪

37:18.974 --> 37:21.843
Linda, I know
what you're thinking.

37:21.845 --> 37:24.896
If you would've just let me
question Christopher Dean,

37:24.898 --> 37:27.432
none of this would've happened.

37:27.434 --> 37:30.235
It's okay, I know you were doing
what you thought was right.

37:30.237 --> 37:31.770
Yeah, actually
I wasn't thinking that,

37:31.772 --> 37:33.721
'cause I know
what I did was right.

37:35.724 --> 37:38.026
I'm really glad
you're okay though.

37:38.028 --> 37:39.861
Thank you.

37:42.948 --> 37:45.399
Uh, the stuff with us, Danny...

37:45.401 --> 37:46.868
(sighs)

37:48.737 --> 37:50.705
This is a bad situation.

37:50.707 --> 37:53.291
I know it was a bad situation.

37:53.293 --> 37:57.245
Danny, we were caught
on opposite sides,

37:57.247 --> 37:59.931
but we were both doing
what we needed to do.

38:01.750 --> 38:04.219
We've been through a lot.

38:04.221 --> 38:05.770
And we always stuck together.

38:08.691 --> 38:12.277
You just-- you can't... do that.

38:12.279 --> 38:14.646
You can't just leave.

38:14.648 --> 38:17.615
I didn't leave leave, Linda.

38:17.617 --> 38:20.618
I just...

38:20.620 --> 38:23.288
I just left.

38:29.662 --> 38:32.446
(sighs)

38:32.448 --> 38:35.750
Maybe I just thought you were
choosing your job over me.

38:35.752 --> 38:37.886
(scoffs)

38:37.888 --> 38:40.138
Danny...

38:40.140 --> 38:41.840
I would never do that.

38:41.842 --> 38:44.025
I know.

38:45.811 --> 38:47.178
I was wrong.

38:47.180 --> 38:48.897
Yeah, you were.

38:50.182 --> 38:53.101
Don't do it again.

38:53.103 --> 38:55.353
No way.

39:01.026 --> 39:02.310
(sighs)

39:02.312 --> 39:05.146
So you think you can make it
to your son's big race?

39:05.148 --> 39:08.750
You see if you can stop me.

39:12.538 --> 39:14.088
I love you.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.656
I love you, too.

39:21.764 --> 39:23.464
Hey!

39:23.466 --> 39:25.800
What's wrong with you guys?
The race starts in a minute.

39:25.802 --> 39:28.770
I'm awake, I'm awake.
Come on, let's go.

39:28.772 --> 39:30.104

Henry.

39:54.214 --> 39:55.413
How's the tooth?

39:55.415 --> 39:57.248
Nice day for a race.

39:57.250 --> 39:59.050
This year, you're going down.

39:59.052 --> 40:00.969
Yeah, I've heard that before.

40:02.388 --> 40:03.371
Usual wager?

40:03.373 --> 40:05.223
A case of Dublin's finest.

40:05.225 --> 40:07.208
Deal.

40:07.210 --> 40:09.561
And I'll drink
the first toast to you.

40:10.646 --> 40:12.814
Like always.

Good luck.

You, too.

40:34.371 --> 40:35.670
Larry.

40:35.672 --> 40:36.905
Cut yourself shaving?

40:36.907 --> 40:39.173
(laughs)
That's funny.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.009
I'm watching you guys.

40:41.011 --> 40:42.677
Just try taking
a rolling start.

40:42.679 --> 40:44.912
We're watching you, too.

Okay, you ready?

40:48.885 --> 40:49.968
Mm-hmm.

40:49.970 --> 40:51.970
Nervous?
Why would I be?

40:51.972 --> 40:53.805
Well, no Reagan man
has ever lost a derby.

40:53.807 --> 40:54.922
It's a lot of pressure.

40:54.924 --> 40:57.091
I was in a coma a few weeks ago;

40:57.093 --> 40:58.759
I think I can handle this.

40:58.761 --> 40:59.927
I think you're right.

40:59.929 --> 41:01.229
Okay, let's go.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.698
Let's do a
vehicle check.

41:03.700 --> 41:04.866
Wheels.
Check.

41:47.310 --> 41:49.444
Well, at least
he got second, you know?

41:49.446 --> 41:50.528
Second is good.

41:50.530 --> 41:52.513
Yeah.
Yeah, out of three kids.

41:52.515 --> 41:54.482
Screw some smiles
on your faces

41:54.484 --> 41:56.034
for Sean's sake.

worse than losing.

The winner is number 13,

42:00.323 --> 42:02.490
Janie Porter.

42:04.176 --> 42:06.377
Oh, well, I
stand corrected.

42:06.379 --> 42:08.629
A girl?

42:08.631 --> 42:09.964
(groans)
DANNY: Lost to a girl.

42:09.966 --> 42:11.766
(laughing)

42:11.768 --> 42:13.468
Oh, well.

42:13.470 --> 42:15.002
I can't believe it.

42:15.004 --> 42:16.354
That car was unbeatable.

42:16.356 --> 42:17.338
Oh, relax, Pop.

42:17.340 --> 42:20.141
Even DiMaggio's
streak ended.

42:21.010 --> 42:22.393
JAMIE:
Come on, buddy.

42:22.395 --> 42:23.978
Hey, there he is!

42:23.980 --> 42:25.196
(cheering)
Good job, buddy.

42:25.198 --> 42:26.314
Nice going.
Great job.

42:26.316 --> 42:28.449
Great race, bud, great race.

42:28.451 --> 42:30.118
Sorry I let you down.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.986
No, no, no, kiddo.

42:31.988 --> 42:33.621
You didn't let me down.

42:33.623 --> 42:36.023
I guess the Henry Special

42:36.025 --> 42:39.160
just finally
ran out of magic.

42:39.162 --> 42:40.578
LINDA:
Come here, you.

42:40.580 --> 42:43.064
You ran a great race.
You did a good job.

42:43.066 --> 42:44.382
Sean, you were flying.

42:44.384 --> 42:46.417
That's right, you did
the Reagan name proud, kid.

42:46.419 --> 42:47.468
FRANK:
Hey.

42:47.470 --> 42:50.471
This is for you.

42:50.473 --> 42:52.423
This is your trophy, Grandpa.

42:52.425 --> 42:53.808
Nope, not anymore.

42:53.810 --> 42:54.926
You did the work.

42:54.928 --> 42:56.394
You ran a clean race.

42:56.396 --> 42:57.428
Yeah.

42:57.430 --> 42:59.981
Come on, how about
some hot chocolate?

42:59.983 --> 43:01.682
All right.

43:05.554 --> 43:09.490
Another family tradition
shot to hell.
