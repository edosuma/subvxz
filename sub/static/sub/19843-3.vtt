WEBVTT

01:27.580 --> 01:29.628
Wait!
Wait, this isn't... Stop!

01:33.550 --> 01:36.587
- We're trying to help.
- By breaking in?

01:36.840 --> 01:38.216
We're chasing him.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.090
The guy who says
he's Danny Rand?

01:42.350 --> 01:44.671
- He escaped from a mental...
- There's nobody here but me.

01:44.850 --> 01:46.260
And I can take care of myself.

01:50.060 --> 01:52.608
- If he does try to contact you...
- That'd be a mistake.

01:56.490 --> 01:58.651
I want nothing to do
with anything Rand.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.776
As you can see.

02:01.530 --> 02:03.737
- Call us.
- Get out.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.806
I'm sorry they, uh...

02:28.140 --> 02:29.641
they broke the lock.

02:30.940 --> 02:33.977
I'll send a bill.
Pretty sure they can cover it.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.197
Listen, I'm gonna make this up to you,
I promise.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.351
Are
the cops coming by?

02:41.120 --> 02:42.610
I haven't broken any laws.

02:44.490 --> 02:46.401
I'm putting myself on the line here.

02:47.450 --> 02:48.701
And I don't like it.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.950
There won't be any more trouble.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.213
The third tenet
of the Bushido code is mercy.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.427
But even that has its limits.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.840
Don't be here in the morning.

04:52.540 --> 04:53.700
Dad?

05:28.820 --> 05:29.946
Dad.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.619
You caught me sleeping.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.176
I can come back.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:53.060 --> 05:55.972
It's so peaceful in here,
I can't help but doze off.

06:11.660 --> 06:15.949
I'm sure we'll find
Danny within the hour.

06:16.790 --> 06:19.327
And it's not like he's
all that sophisticated.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.201
Make sure to pay
for the door repair at the hospital.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.166
And I don't want
anyone talking.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.923
Now, what about the pier deal?
Patel?

06:29.220 --> 06:30.676
Oh, um...

06:31.760 --> 06:35.423
Well, uh, he's not responding
to our offers.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.511
He said he's not
interested in selling.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.057
- I don't think he's gonna budge.
- Add 10%.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.600
Okay.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.568
But we're already a million
over the appraised value.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.857
- Why is this so important?
- Oh, you don't need to know that.

06:50.570 --> 06:53.198
And I want you to
put Joy onto Patel.

06:53.370 --> 06:55.190
She'll be able to close it.

06:55.370 --> 06:56.826
I can handle this.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.544
Doesn't it occur to you
that I'm doing this all for you?

07:10.720 --> 07:14.133
That I work day and night so I can
hand you something that's successful?

07:14.300 --> 07:17.463
That works out easily,
because I want you to succeed?

07:18.140 --> 07:19.437
Yeah, I guess.

07:20.730 --> 07:21.765
You guess?

07:25.360 --> 07:27.021
- I believe you.
- Really?

07:27.190 --> 07:32.355
Because it doesn't seem that way
when you directly disobey an order.

07:32.530 --> 07:35.078
I asked to have Danny moved
to a safe location,

07:35.240 --> 07:36.821
and you tried to
have him killed.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.366
You don't understand that...

07:43.380 --> 07:46.247
If you just do things my way,
it'll all work out for you, Ward.

07:46.420 --> 07:47.626
Can't you see that?

07:49.010 --> 07:51.581
Danny has nowhere else to go,
but to come to us.

07:51.760 --> 07:55.469
So I'm asking you,
when he reappears, keep him safe...

07:56.470 --> 07:58.051
until I decide
what to do with him.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.381
Do I need to spell
it out any further?

08:00.560 --> 08:03.393
No. No, I got it. I...

08:04.770 --> 08:06.397
I'll take care of all of it.

08:12.910 --> 08:16.903
You're my son, and I'm gonna
make you a great man.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.860
Just cooperate.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.577
- Please.
- Yeah, I get it.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.628
Hey, I love you, Ward.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.995
I love you so much.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.530
I don't know what he's doing here.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.869
Hey!

09:11.840 --> 09:12.909
Hey!

09:20.470 --> 09:21.846
Thought I was pretty clear.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.385
Very clear.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.096
Then why aren't you gone?

09:25.890 --> 09:27.517
I'm worried for your safety.

09:27.690 --> 09:29.726
Please.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.989
I don't need you to protect me.

09:33.530 --> 09:35.350
Are you sure?

09:36.660 --> 09:38.730
Because the fat one
who smelled like toe fungus

09:38.910 --> 09:40.821
- landed a blow.
- And paid the price.

09:40.990 --> 09:42.036
Still...

09:42.950 --> 09:44.702
he never should
have gotten that close.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.376
You, um...

09:50.420 --> 09:51.830
You mean like this?

09:53.050 --> 09:56.622
You see, the tiger form uses
internal force, and not external strength.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.341
So it's not necessary
to use charging momentum.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.181
Which lowers the risk
of moving in.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.739
You're working too hard.
Too much external force.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.691
It's internal force
you want to master.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.587
And you should master silence.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.369
Leopard Punch.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.474
But again, all this power derives
from the harnessing of inner force.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.973
Your chi can be focused and brought
into the fight to overcome any obstacle.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.720
Amazing.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.719
I love it.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.390
Thanks for showing me.

11:00.740 --> 11:01.775
What?

11:03.450 --> 11:06.032
Come on. Really?

11:06.580 --> 11:07.649
Really.

11:07.870 --> 11:10.077
We were having fun.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.820
Yeah, we were.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.542
But it doesn't change anything.
You can't be here.

11:18.130 --> 11:19.540
What if I pay your rent?

11:20.720 --> 11:23.211
Cover whatever you need
for the next six months, huh?

11:24.220 --> 11:25.630
I'll just stay for a week.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.137
You're an escaped mental patient
who can't even afford a haircut.

11:29.310 --> 11:33.144
Yes, I can,
I just haven't gotten around to it.

11:34.310 --> 11:36.107
Look, I'm Danny Rand!

11:36.270 --> 11:38.397
Like you see on the building.

11:38.570 --> 11:42.233
And I'm Colleen Wing,
who's too broke to fix this door, so...

11:44.280 --> 11:48.239
Look, I'll have all this solved by Friday.
Door included.

11:48.830 --> 11:50.115
Then...

11:50.410 --> 11:52.662
Then I can pay you
an entire year's rent.

11:52.830 --> 11:54.127
How does that sound?

11:54.290 --> 11:55.996
- Friday?
- Yeah.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.375
Come on.

12:02.130 --> 12:05.099
Okay, whatever.
But you sleep in that corner.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.637
And you don't go anywhere
near the students. And...

12:09.640 --> 12:11.301
use the bathroom at Starbucks.

12:12.100 --> 12:14.557
Okay. You're the boss.

12:14.730 --> 12:17.142
And it might help
if you took a shower.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.560
Soon.

12:21.650 --> 12:24.699
All I'm saying is when people
start to discover it's Danny,

12:24.870 --> 12:26.235
we're gonna have a problem.

12:26.410 --> 12:29.152
We can't admit that it's him,
even if it is true.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.788
You and I need to be united
on that front, okay?

12:32.960 --> 12:36.168
Wouldn't it just be easier
to accommodate him?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.160
Do you really want
to negotiate with somebody

12:39.340 --> 12:41.160
who clearly has mental problems?

12:41.470 --> 12:44.428
No, but we have to do
the right thing here.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.251
We are doing the right thing.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.465
What, exactly?

12:48.720 --> 12:51.632
I'm working on something
that will be generous,

12:51.810 --> 12:54.222
efficient and benefit both sides.

12:54.390 --> 12:55.516
Trust me.

12:55.690 --> 12:58.898
Once the paperwork is done,
we can talk about it.

13:00.610 --> 13:04.273
Besides, I have something else
that needs your attention.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.731
The pier deal and Raj Patel.

13:07.910 --> 13:09.400
You're kidding, right?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.867
Why do we care
about that crappy pier?

13:12.040 --> 13:13.530
Just...

13:13.790 --> 13:16.623
help me out, please?

13:17.210 --> 13:19.371
You used to come to my room
when we were kids

13:19.540 --> 13:21.667
and ask me to do your homework
with that same line.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.377
And I passed calculus because of it.

13:25.010 --> 13:26.295
I don't see the problem.

13:27.550 --> 13:29.290
Just send me the goddamned files.

13:29.470 --> 13:30.630
Thank you.

13:48.780 --> 13:49.769
You know...

13:50.280 --> 13:53.033
in another life,
this would have been romantic.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.861
In another life, you wouldn't have drugged
me and sent me to a mental hospital.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.126
Fair enough.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.956
We're friends.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.500
Can't we start acting like it?

14:05.470 --> 14:08.007
So you came with
a peace offering of...

14:08.890 --> 14:10.630
oranges and flowers?

14:10.800 --> 14:14.634
Yeah, it's, uh...
it's a Buddhist tradition.

14:15.310 --> 14:17.130
_ It's meant to
remInd you of our bond.

14:18.730 --> 14:19.890
Kind of like the M&M's.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.115
Danny, what happened to you?

14:40.130 --> 14:42.280
Why are you back here?

14:43.040 --> 14:44.371
It's complicated.

14:46.510 --> 14:51.083
And every time I try and tell the story,
people freak out.

14:53.220 --> 14:56.519
But you and Ward,
you're the only link to a life that I had.

14:56.730 --> 15:01.429
It kept me going under very
difficult circumstances.

15:02.650 --> 15:05.221
- Maybe it sounds ridiculous but...
- Yeah.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.100
...it's all I got.

15:09.530 --> 15:11.521
No, it doesn't sound ridiculous.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.611
I was 13 when Dad died.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.953
And I still hadn't quite gotten over you
and your family.

15:24.670 --> 15:26.911
I was lost. I...

15:27.920 --> 15:31.219
I didn't care about anything.
I was just going through the motions.

15:33.430 --> 15:36.092
But I had this...
I had this vision...

15:37.060 --> 15:39.551
this dream...

15:39.730 --> 15:41.800
...that kept happening over and over.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.228
- I was a kid...
- ...back at school...

15:46.270 --> 15:49.239
and there Dad was,
at the end of the day, just...

15:49.610 --> 15:51.658
standing by the fence waiting for me.

15:52.610 --> 15:57.115
And I'd run to him, and he'd take my hand
just as I passed the gate.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.655
And then the dream would end.

16:02.710 --> 16:04.120
But his smile...

16:06.540 --> 16:09.122
...I must have had that dream
a hundred times.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.371
I had a dream about him, too.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.169
VVhen?

16:14.340 --> 16:15.591
In the hospital.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.552
At first, I...
I thought he was a hungry ghost.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.722
The people from where I'm from
believe these ghosts...

16:25.730 --> 16:28.972
wander because they've been
neglected by their family.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.355
Danny...

16:32.280 --> 16:34.737
- Uh...
- No, no, no. I know.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.696
It sounds weird.

16:37.490 --> 16:40.789
- The drugs they had me on were intense.
- Yeah? Huh.

16:40.950 --> 16:42.702
But it even smelled like him.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.372
Calvin Klein, right?

16:48.340 --> 16:49.705
Marc Jacobs.

16:51.550 --> 16:53.086
You mind if we go inside?

16:53.630 --> 16:55.336
Yeah.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.296
That's cool.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.851
I wanna be fair with you, Danny.

17:10.940 --> 17:11.986
Okay.

17:14.070 --> 17:18.279
When Dad died,
I was left with a huge responsibility.

17:18.740 --> 17:21.152
Our fathers created
something Important, and...

17:22.450 --> 17:25.829
it's my job to keep
it healthy and vital.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.625
This is our offer for your shares.

17:38.260 --> 17:40.558
I think it's quite generous.

17:41.890 --> 17:43.596
Hundred million dollars?

17:44.600 --> 17:48.149
Ward wanted to give you 40,
but I got him to go higher.

17:48.310 --> 17:50.312
Just think of all
you could do with that.

17:55.070 --> 17:56.640
I have to change my name?

17:57.990 --> 18:00.402
The world already thinks
Danny Rand is dead.

18:00.910 --> 18:02.480
Let's just leave it that way.

18:02.910 --> 18:04.571
You can pick a name you love.

18:04.870 --> 18:07.498
You can start all over.
It IS gonna be great.

18:08.540 --> 18:09.746
What happened to you?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.410
- Danny...
- Is this how you treat family?

18:14.380 --> 18:16.792
Yes, actually, it is.

18:18.050 --> 18:20.348
You know, the generosity of this offer
speaks for itself.

18:20.510 --> 18:25.470
Look, you may not understand it,
but Ward and I worked for this money.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.847
We worked day and night,
while you were off doing...

18:28.850 --> 18:29.896
whatever you were doing.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.722
So... don't turn your nose up...

18:34.530 --> 18:36.020
Danny... Hey!

18:36.190 --> 18:37.600
Danny...

18:38.070 --> 18:40.982
So, you're gonna be the guy
who walks away from $100 million?

18:43.160 --> 18:44.445
It's not about money.

18:45.410 --> 18:48.243
I thought you understood.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.126
I have to live in the real world, Danny.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.000
This is how it works!

19:05.560 --> 19:07.425
I've been meaning to ask...

19:10.480 --> 19:11.720
what's this?

19:12.650 --> 19:14.015
You should see the other guy.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.232
- Someone attacked you?
- Hell, no.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.946
I, uh... I got this at the club.

19:21.570 --> 19:23.652
Darryl... please.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.446
- How many times?
- Come on, sensei.

19:26.740 --> 19:28.708
I got my mums and... and two brothers.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.116
You think I could cover that
with what I make pushing a broom?

19:31.290 --> 19:33.781
I get it, but those private
fights are illegal.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.372
With all the shit I could've got into,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.165
you want to bust me
for making a dollar fighting?

19:38.340 --> 19:40.922
You're up for a scholarship, Darryl.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.172
And when the committee calls me,
they ask about character as well as skill.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.966
I want to be able to give you
the highest recommendation.

19:47.140 --> 19:50.052
Scholarships and school,
that's all in the future.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.220
I have to live today.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.261
You dishonour yourself
when you fight for money.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.447
There's more at stake here
than just your bIlls.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.186
Excuse me.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.435
Hey.

21:18.230 --> 21:19.640
Are you the one
who takes care of these?

21:20.730 --> 21:22.231
The gravestones?

21:22.530 --> 21:24.066
No, the family takes care of those.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.946
What if everyone in
the family's dead?

21:26.110 --> 21:29.614
I don't know, man.
I just cut the grass.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.407
But you could ask in the office.

21:32.410 --> 21:34.571
Okay. Thanks.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.789
- Step away from me!
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.130
I said step away from me.

21:47.300 --> 21:50.178
Hey, J-Money, it's Danny Rand.

21:51.430 --> 21:53.887
- Look, you remember me, right?
- No.

21:54.060 --> 21:54.970
Come on.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.893
You were an intern in the legal
department in my dad's office?

21:59.440 --> 22:01.977
You called his secretary Margaret
a "hatchet-faced bitch."

22:02.150 --> 22:03.526
I was standing right there.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.022
You gave me five bucks to keep quiet.

22:08.450 --> 22:09.519
Where was my office?

22:10.280 --> 22:12.657
Um... You didn't have one.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.991
They put you in the copy room.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.070
My desk?

22:16.250 --> 22:17.911
Uh... It was a folding table.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.820
With a...
with a file under one leg,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.582
because the floor, it was...
it was too uneven.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.001
Yeah?

22:24.920 --> 22:26.330
I went to your funeral.

22:28.010 --> 22:29.136
Yeah.

22:31.890 --> 22:34.597
I've been handling the estate
since the crash.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.386
That includes making sure
that the graves are tended.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.470
Thank you.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.937
The least I could do.

22:40.940 --> 22:42.726
Your father gave me my first job.

22:43.940 --> 22:47.694
He always wanted Rand to be
something good in the world.

22:49.490 --> 22:51.367
So, I'm guessing you're not a fan
of the Meachums?

22:52.700 --> 22:55.328
We have a very
complicated relationship.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.283
Well, they don't want me
anywhere near there, so...

22:59.460 --> 23:02.418
That's totally understandable.
They don't play well with others.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.662
We need to dig up every shred
of physical evidence

23:05.840 --> 23:07.501
we can find to
prove your Identity.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.369
Was I wrong?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.420
To turn down $100 million?

23:13.600 --> 23:18.378
It may have been the smartest
thing you did, other than coming to me.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.510
You are worth billions, Danny.

23:22.690 --> 23:24.567
Not millions.

23:24.730 --> 23:26.641
It seems like that's all anyone
wants to talk about.

23:26.820 --> 23:29.482
Because it's the only language
that they speak.

23:29.780 --> 23:34.319
And it is important that you learn
to understand it if you want to win.

23:34.910 --> 23:36.320
They're supposed
to be my friends.

23:36.490 --> 23:38.071
Listen, I can help you
get your business back,

23:38.250 --> 23:40.036
but I cannot help
you make friends.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.409
Okay.

23:43.330 --> 23:44.661
All right, so...

23:46.840 --> 23:48.000
what's it gonna cost me?

23:49.220 --> 23:50.209
Nothing.

23:50.880 --> 23:54.884
But if we win, my firm is on
permanent retainer for Rand.

23:56.470 --> 23:57.459
Deal?

23:58.850 --> 23:59.839
Deal.

24:01.730 --> 24:05.518
We have a suite set up
for occasions like this.

24:05.690 --> 24:07.396
I need you to lay low...

24:07.610 --> 24:10.101
and I need you to keep
from drawing any attention to yourself.

24:10.280 --> 24:13.602
Okay, I'm, uh...
I'm staying at the Chikara.

24:13.780 --> 24:16.192
Is that in Brooklyn?
The new place with the glass floor?

24:16.370 --> 24:19.407
No, it's a... it's a dojo.

24:19.580 --> 24:21.241
- Has plastic mats.
- Ah.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.570
Well, do you have any money
for some new clothes,

24:24.750 --> 24:27.412
because this homeless hipster thing
isn't working for you.

24:27.590 --> 24:30.002
Why is everyone on at me
about how I look?

24:30.470 --> 24:31.789
It's New York City.

24:32.380 --> 24:33.540
It matters.

24:58.530 --> 25:01.033
If this is too much for you...

25:01.200 --> 25:03.498
- What?
- Oh, you've got your look.

25:03.660 --> 25:07.209
Your sweaty, scowly,
stick-up-your-ass thing.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.377
Wow, confidence builder.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.121
I can handle Patel by myself.

25:14.760 --> 25:15.920
Sit this one out.

25:16.090 --> 25:18.342
Not a chance. Too important.

25:19.350 --> 25:22.888
Okay, but you cannot be a drag tonight.

25:23.230 --> 25:26.518
We're doing something unusual
and I can't have you screwing it up.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.761
Am I that big a problem?

25:31.230 --> 25:32.561
You've got a nice smile.

25:33.570 --> 25:36.858
Use it. Just as an experiment maybe.

25:39.620 --> 25:40.689
Hmm.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.547
Raj!

25:50.710 --> 25:53.452
- Figured there's no time to waste.
- Exactly.

25:56.050 --> 25:58.541
Hmm. Man after my own heart.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.177
Thank you. Let me pour this.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.959
- Thank you.
- Ward?

26:04.560 --> 26:06.801
- Sure.
- So, what's on the agenda?

26:07.980 --> 26:11.063
A night you will never forget.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.812
I like the sound of that.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.361
- Yeah, there you go. Good.
- Yeah.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.861
- Good! Good! Stay loose.
- Yeah.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.861
Good. Stay loose.
Good. Good. Nice.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.076
Good, move, move, move!
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.081
Don't let him get you.
Don't let him get you.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.410
Good!

26:33.590 --> 26:35.501
Push! Yeah, nice!

26:35.670 --> 26:37.547
Yeah, good. Breathe.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.755
Come on, move in! Move!

26:38.930 --> 26:41.046
Good!

26:41.260 --> 26:43.888
That was good.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.881
Oh!

26:48.060 --> 26:51.052
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

26:58.860 --> 27:02.193
Ah, maybe we should
move on to weapons now.

27:02.950 --> 27:04.235
I think I'm ready.

27:06.910 --> 27:08.650
We are disappointed.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.199
I...

27:13.420 --> 27:14.739
I'm sorry to hear that.

27:15.630 --> 27:18.212
There are discussions
about your loyalty.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.920
Why?
I'm doing everything you ask.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.965
I've got my best people
working on the pier.

27:26.140 --> 27:27.721
Why did you leave?

27:29.390 --> 27:31.847
There was an emergency
I had to attend to.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.476
What emergency?

27:36.530 --> 27:39.772
There's... there's an impostor
trying to inﬁltrate the company.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.100
A young man
claiming to be Danny Rand.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.827
I needed to see for myself.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.327
And?

27:48.870 --> 27:50.246
It's not going to be a problem.

27:50.410 --> 27:52.037
We have an agreement.

27:52.250 --> 27:55.378
You must h_onour it to the letter
or there Will be consequences.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.627
Yeah, I... I understand.

27:58.380 --> 28:00.507
- Kneel.
- What?

28:01.720 --> 28:03.335
On your knees.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.808
The, uh... the glass.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.220
KneeL

28:30.910 --> 28:32.207
Scissor punch!

28:39.420 --> 28:40.910
Scissor punch.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.459
Shuffle step.

28:45.430 --> 28:46.886
Round hook punch.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.766
Round hook punch!

28:51.600 --> 28:52.806
I got a Red Hook punch.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.470
- Red Hook?
- But it goes like this.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.470
Enough!

29:02.240 --> 29:04.526
The dojo is a place of respect.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.309
And who the hell are you?

29:06.950 --> 29:08.906
Maybe you wanna test me and find out.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.866
Ooh!

29:11.200 --> 29:12.781
You chatter like monkeys.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.201
Your kicks and punches
are like lace curtains.

29:17.710 --> 29:19.746
Silence your inner voice.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.121
Draw strength from your centre.

29:28.890 --> 29:31.962
Go slow at the beginning.

29:54.710 --> 29:55.859
Come on.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.410
What the hell?

30:03.010 --> 30:04.045
Who put you in charge?

30:04.220 --> 30:06.586
Is this a kindergarten,
or are you training warriors?

30:06.760 --> 30:09.001
I am trying to provide
a safe place for people.

30:09.180 --> 30:12.672
Half the kids out there get beaten
on a regular basis by family or bullies.

30:12.850 --> 30:16.388
This is the one place where they don't
have to worry about that, until now.

30:19.860 --> 30:20.849
I'm sorry.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.568
I know you're in a bind.
Having a tough time.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.191
But you can't be here.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.489
SenseL

30:51.260 --> 30:53.091
And here we are.

30:53.260 --> 30:55.558
Already?

30:55.720 --> 30:58.518
What is this?
I thought we were headed to a restaurant.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.896
We'll get there.

31:00.310 --> 31:01.800
But first things first.

31:02.730 --> 31:05.187
Trust me, you're gonna like this.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.630
I don't understand.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.596
And, frankly, this is starting
to creep me out.

31:41.770 --> 31:43.476
Meet Kevin Kennedy.

31:44.860 --> 31:49.729
On life support following an auto accident
for over a year.

31:49.900 --> 31:53.904
He weighed 185
and has O negative blood.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.536
In 30 minutes...

31:59.000 --> 32:03.664
Kevin's family will enter this room
with a priest who will say last rites

32:03.830 --> 32:09.621
before the doctor takes him
off life support and he dies.

32:10.260 --> 32:11.579
-Joy”.
- Wait.

32:14.640 --> 32:18.349
Because Kevin was awesome,
he signed up to donate his organs.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.091
One of which is a liver.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.471
Which is a perfect match for Terence.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.526
Exactly.

32:30.650 --> 32:35.861
His liver will never go
to the national list.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.492
It will go
directly to your nephew.

32:39.750 --> 32:40.694
Tonight.

32:40.870 --> 32:42.997
How the hell did you manage this?

32:45.210 --> 32:46.871
Rand has many friends.

32:48.090 --> 32:50.001
We'd like to add you to that list.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.717
And the pier is my buy-in.

35:25.370 --> 35:29.329
You, uh... really went
above and beyond last night.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.319
Thanks.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.798
So, you want to tell me
what's so important about this pier?

35:36.760 --> 35:40.218
It's just an acquisition we need...
for the future.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.006
So you're not gonna tell me.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.881
It's strategic. That's all.

35:46.890 --> 35:49.723
You know... it really pisses me off.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.219
What?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.436
The fact you won't tell me
what you're planning.

35:54.980 --> 35:56.390
This is our company, Ward.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.537
Do you ever think
about walking away from it?

36:07.700 --> 36:09.827
Yeah.

36:10.580 --> 36:11.615
Honestly.

36:14.790 --> 36:17.122
Dad put all that stuff in the will.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.464
He wanted us_to r_un Rand.
We lose everything If we leave.

36:21.630 --> 36:22.790
I know.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.419
But...

36:27.430 --> 36:29.762
people have been known to start over...

36:31.390 --> 36:32.937
with nothing.

36:47.660 --> 36:49.196
You're really thinking about this,
aren't you?

36:51.120 --> 36:52.360
I'm tired...

36:53.710 --> 36:55.166
of a lot of things.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.626
I'd miss you.

37:03.590 --> 37:05.217
So, you wouldn't come with me?

37:08.640 --> 37:09.846
I love Rand.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.052
If it's not like that for you...

37:14.060 --> 37:15.266
...that's fine.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.648
You know I back
you no matter what.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.099
Right?

37:20.400 --> 37:23.642
I just want you to be happy.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.651
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.493
Your case is turning out to be
more of a challenge than I thought.

37:38.040 --> 37:41.453
- How so?
- There is no proof of Danny Rand anywhere.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.128
Every single record,
your birth certificate, doctors' visits...

37:45.300 --> 37:47.256
Didn't you at least have a library card?

37:47.890 --> 37:49.926
Uh... Yeah. Sure.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.136
Danny, it's gone, too.

37:52.310 --> 37:54.972
Now I think that the Meachums
are behind it, of course.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.972
If we do not have
something definitive,

37:58.230 --> 38:01.472
we are going to lose,
and I don't like that.

38:02.150 --> 38:04.892
Is there anything you didn't tell me?
Something that you might have missed.

38:11.450 --> 38:12.485
Maybe.

38:30.010 --> 38:31.136
Hello?

38:40.230 --> 38:41.356
Hello?

38:44.740 --> 38:47.106
Hey, uh... can you help me?

38:49.320 --> 38:50.776
Yeah, sure.
What do you need?

38:51.160 --> 38:55.449
I'm, uh... just looking for an X-ray
from a visit when I was a kid.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.405
I don't know. Do you have a date?

38:57.790 --> 39:00.031
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it was in July 2001.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.492
I, uh...
I broke my arm skateboarding.

39:04.920 --> 39:05.909
Sure, sure.

39:06.090 --> 39:09.833
The X-rays from that period
are on that shelf to your right.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.549
Uh. VC guys think it's a good investment,
and I think so, too.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.927
Okay. I'd like to take a look.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.805
Danny. Danny...

41:28.150 --> 41:31.642
It's hard, really.
Trying to get my head around all this.

41:31.820 --> 41:33.310
This is not the time or the place.

41:33.490 --> 41:35.105
You were like a brother to me.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.117
A terrible jackass for a brother,
but still...

41:38.830 --> 41:39.819
I looked up to you.

41:39.990 --> 41:41.230
What does that have
to do with anything?

41:41.330 --> 41:42.786
I know you sent that guy.

41:42.950 --> 41:45.418
You were the only one with me
the day I broke my arm.

41:45.580 --> 41:47.707
- What guy?
- Why is this so important to you?

41:47.920 --> 41:50.047
- Do you hate me that much?
- Yes.

41:50.210 --> 41:52.417
Because the Danny Rand that I knew,
he's dead.

41:52.590 --> 41:54.831
And I want him to stay that way.

41:55.010 --> 41:56.716
Stop it! Stop it!

41:57.840 --> 41:59.637
Back up.

42:00.760 --> 42:03.137
- I don't understand.
- Isn't it obvious?

42:03.640 --> 42:06.689
I'm not your sister,
he's not your brother.

42:06.850 --> 42:09.398
We don't want you here.

42:18.780 --> 42:20.190
Danny, listen...

42:22.120 --> 42:24.190
we can work this out, okay?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.200
I have Hogarth now.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.415
We're coming for you.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.876
You can't deny what's mine.

42:33.050 --> 42:36.213
What my father meant for me to have.

42:39.050 --> 42:40.381
Sir.

42:44.100 --> 42:46.136
Give me everything
you have on Danny.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.595
Everything.

42:47.770 --> 42:49.726
I have to face
Hogarth tomorrow,

42:49.900 --> 42:52.357
and I don't want to
be caught off guard like I was just now.

43:18.590 --> 43:20.217
Do you feel bad?

43:21.800 --> 43:23.097
About what you said?

43:23.260 --> 43:24.557
About what we're doing?

43:24.720 --> 43:26.881
I wonder why it has to be so complicated.

43:27.810 --> 43:31.769
And I really wish that I could find
something in Danny to hate because...

43:33.820 --> 43:35.219
it would make things
a lot easier for me.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.028
He just tried to
attack your brother.

43:43.030 --> 43:45.737
He also said Dad visited him

43:45.910 --> 43:47.446
- in the mental hospital.
- What?

43:47.620 --> 43:48.609
Yeah.

43:49.540 --> 43:50.666
So...

43:52.380 --> 43:54.746
maybe he is as crazy as you say he is.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.601
Let's get him out of here!
Well done!

45:04.780 --> 45:05.815
All right!

45:05.990 --> 45:07.400
How do you think of this guy, huh?

45:07.580 --> 45:09.980
How about some respect? Well done!

45:10.160 --> 45:12.537
Now, I told you it was gonna be
a great night, didn't I?

45:12.830 --> 45:16.072
Yeah! Well, I hope you didn't lose
your money on that one.

45:17.290 --> 45:20.123
'Cause now we got the open round!

45:21.380 --> 45:23.757
That's right. Any of you guys
wanna get in and take a shot,

45:23.930 --> 45:25.500
sign up with Leon right there.

45:26.850 --> 45:29.250
Who's it gonna be? Gonna be you?

45:29.430 --> 45:31.728
Who's gonna be
the tough guy, huh?

45:31.890 --> 45:33.630
You? You gonna be the tough guy?

45:33.850 --> 45:36.398
How about you, pretty boy?
You? You gonna be the tough guy?

45:36.560 --> 45:37.936
Who's in?

45:38.230 --> 45:40.107
Come on,
who wants to take a chance?

45:41.110 --> 45:44.523
It keeps getting better!
Look what we have here!

45:45.070 --> 45:46.697
You got, like, a fighting name
or something?

45:49.740 --> 45:50.946
Daughter of the Dragon.

45:51.580 --> 45:54.572
She calls herself
the Daughter of the Dragon!

46:01.380 --> 46:02.870
You sure you wanna do this, honey?

46:03.050 --> 46:04.540
Call me honey again, I dare ya.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.291
Oh, I like it when you talk dirty.

46:07.470 --> 46:08.676
Okay, then.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.806
We got any challengers?

46:10.970 --> 46:12.460
Who's it gonna be, huh?

46:12.640 --> 46:14.676
Anybody wanna take on the little lady?

46:20.610 --> 46:24.102
Rusty, uh... that's not fair.

46:25.740 --> 46:27.605
I paid my entry fee same as her.

46:28.070 --> 46:28.946
Leon?

46:31.240 --> 46:32.286
All right.

46:32.450 --> 46:33.530
Place your bets!

46:34.160 --> 46:35.240
Fighters...

46:38.040 --> 46:39.826
I don't wanna
have to call an ambulance, huh?

46:40.000 --> 46:41.740
- For him?
- Cut the bullshit.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.081
You get in over your head, you tap out.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.336
And Rusty, I warned you last time
about the biting.

46:46.510 --> 46:48.171
Do it again,
and I will 86 your ass. I swear.

46:48.340 --> 46:49.329
I heard you.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.006
Ain't gonna be no need of that,
I'm pretty sure.

46:52.180 --> 46:55.388
Knockout or tap out,
and that's the end of the fight.

46:55.730 --> 46:58.597
Otherwise... whatever works. Hmm?

46:58.900 --> 46:59.969
All right, all bets are in!

47:00.150 --> 47:02.892
Hold on to your junk, boys!

47:20.170 --> 47:21.068
Come on, man!

47:21.250 --> 47:22.740
Cut the Floyd Mayweather shit.

47:22.920 --> 47:24.296
This is a...

48:19.930 --> 48:21.261
Ah!

49:01.600 --> 49:03.386
The Daughter of the Dragon!

49:07.110 --> 49:08.395
Yeah!

49:17.700 --> 49:20.863
I don't know where you came from,
but you're welcome anytime.

49:51.030 --> 49:52.486
Good to see you again, Jeri.

49:52.650 --> 49:54.277
Wish I could say the same.

49:55.360 --> 49:58.864
Okay, well... let's get started, shall we?

49:59.240 --> 50:00.195
Please do.

50:00.660 --> 50:04.573
Since the time of our last offer,
we have had a change of heart.

50:04.910 --> 50:11.042
Due to your client's continuing harassment
and threats to me and my brother,

50:11.630 --> 50:15.214
we have decided
to lower our offer to 20 million...

50:15.800 --> 50:17.586
and added a restraining order.

50:18.220 --> 50:21.098
The restraining
order is a nice touch.

50:21.260 --> 50:22.466
Ithoughtso.

50:22.680 --> 50:26.764
But since the time of your last offer,
we have had a change of heart as well.

50:27.440 --> 50:32.719
We are still insisting on the full rights
guaranteed as the sole heir of Rand,

50:32.900 --> 50:35.482
which includes
a controlling 51%,

50:35.650 --> 50:37.948
board seat and compensation,

50:38.660 --> 50:41.948
but we are now adding a corner office,
support staff,

50:42.120 --> 50:44.941
and a housing allowance
in the amount of one million per year.

50:50.040 --> 50:54.044
Your sense of humour has always
been your best attribute but come on.

50:55.050 --> 50:57.462
You can't even prove
he's who he says he is.

50:57.630 --> 51:01.543
At best he's crazy,
at worst he's a con man.

51:02.140 --> 51:06.304
Take the offer
and be thankful that we don't sue you.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.469
Ward...

51:07.890 --> 51:11.553
I'm glad you mentioned my sense of humour.
I thought it was my ass.

51:12.520 --> 51:14.147
As for proof of identity...

51:21.160 --> 51:24.323
What's this?

51:25.410 --> 51:26.286
Turn it over.

51:32.460 --> 51:35.543
I was, uh... I was always a poor speller.

51:42.470 --> 51:46.713
This doesn't prove anything.
Anybody could have made this.

51:46.890 --> 51:48.175
Look closely.

51:49.390 --> 51:52.803
There is a child's fingerprint
in the unfinished part of the clay,

51:52.980 --> 51:55.392
right next to Joy's name.

52:02.490 --> 52:03.696
I assure you...

52:04.620 --> 52:06.406
it is an exact match.

52:07.500 --> 52:11.573
And I will be happy to depose Joy
to establish provenance.

52:11.750 --> 52:12.990
How did they get this?

52:13.170 --> 52:14.626
I have no idea.

52:16.460 --> 52:17.540
Did you steal it?

52:17.710 --> 52:20.713
That is immaterial.
You know that it will hold up in court.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.099
It proves Danny's identity,
and that is all we need.

52:25.720 --> 52:26.755
Fine.

52:27.770 --> 52:30.933
I will bury you in motions,
and delays,

52:31.100 --> 52:32.556
discovery, and depositions,

52:32.730 --> 52:36.894
and he will not see a dime
for at least ten years, maybe longer.

52:37.480 --> 52:39.607
We will see you in court.

52:49.950 --> 52:52.953
It could have been so easy.

52:53.790 --> 52:57.089
You could have just taken the money
and had a great life.

53:00.460 --> 53:01.836
It's my name.

53:03.050 --> 53:04.711
And it means something.

53:44.470 --> 53:46.461
- Hey, I'll be back in a second.
- Mm.

53:52.020 --> 53:54.341
Yeah, I think Joy helped Hogarth,

53:54.520 --> 53:56.340
but I can't prove it.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.896
We need another plan.

54:00.650 --> 54:01.935
Okay.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.487
We can talk about it when I get there.

54:25.930 --> 54:26.919
Fifty.

54:27.930 --> 54:28.919
Yes, sir.

55:23.690 --> 55:26.648
His being represented
by her grants him legitimacy.

55:26.820 --> 55:28.947
- Yes...
- And your fixer almost killed him.

55:29.110 --> 55:31.066
Why did you go see him?

55:33.080 --> 55:34.650
I do what I want.

55:34.830 --> 55:39.665
No, actually, I do what I want.

55:41.170 --> 55:46.290
I can walk out of here,
go to the corner for a cup of coffee,

55:46.630 --> 55:49.872
go to the movies,
talk to people on the street.

55:50.050 --> 55:51.335
You can't.

56:24.250 --> 56:27.413
[ffgo to the
New York Times
and tell them to come...

56:27.590 --> 56:30.252
Your sister'd be
killed and so would you.

56:30.420 --> 56:31.796
How do you know that?

56:32.050 --> 56:35.042
Because this is mild.

56:35.970 --> 56:39.383
This is what happened when I went
to see Danny and they found out.

56:42.350 --> 56:43.760
I'm trapped, Ward.

56:45.520 --> 56:48.398
I'm trapped and I need you
to keep helping me.

56:48.570 --> 56:52.199
I don't have anyone else.
