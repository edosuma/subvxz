00:19.062 --> 00:20.542
[Abby]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:20.629 --> 00:23.153
[metal clanging]

00:23.240 --> 00:25.547
[Dr. Barclay] Maria Sunderland,
I have received a court order

00:25.634 --> 00:27.636
to place you
in a secure holding facility

00:27.723 --> 00:30.117
while awaiting
a full psychiatric evaluation.

00:30.204 --> 00:33.076
Alec's missing.
I think someone's taken him.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.860
Alec has to be in there.
I'm going inside.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.776
[screaming]

00:37.863 --> 00:38.908
[Swamp Thing]
What are you doing to me?

00:38.995 --> 00:41.128
The plants somehow absorbed

00:41.215 --> 00:42.912
Alec Holland. It's conscious.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.305
[Swamp Thing]
I don't understand.

00:44.392 --> 00:46.742
You're a plant
that thinks it's a man.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.179
-Sweetheart?
-[Caroline] Remember...
to take...

00:49.266 --> 00:50.615
-I remembered...
-You took them all?

00:51.964 --> 00:52.791
Caroline!

00:54.880 --> 00:56.317
[Wyler] Go check it out.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.274
[Crane] Show yourselves.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.626
[growling]

01:04.238 --> 01:06.109
-[Abby] Alec!
-[Swamp Thing] Abby.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.067
The light...

01:09.286 --> 01:11.897
I have to go back to the cove.
I have to know if it's true.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.641
I am so sorry.

01:16.728 --> 01:19.383
Alec Holland is dead.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.313
[Abby] I'm so sorry.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.010
[Swamp Thing]
I was never Alec Holland.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.058
That's not true.

01:42.145 --> 01:45.235
I'm a thing
born from his death.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.019
A blurred copy
of his consciousness.

01:47.107 --> 01:47.933
No.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.502
Everything inside of you

01:51.589 --> 01:53.200
that made you Alec
is still there,

01:53.287 --> 01:54.201
his mind...

01:55.071 --> 01:55.898
his memories.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.554
Memories?

01:59.641 --> 02:01.643
Memories stolen
from a dead man.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.210
You saved Susie.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.908
Alec, you saved me.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.306
All I wanted
was to be human again.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.048
And all I've wanted is
to make that happen.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.616
You have to believe me.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.055
When I look into your eyes...

02:25.449 --> 02:26.755
I see you.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.410
I see

02:29.497 --> 02:31.499
the presence of the man
that I once knew.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.198
[grunt anxiously]

02:37.505 --> 02:38.288
What?

02:39.550 --> 02:40.551
Men...

02:42.988 --> 02:44.076
They're coming back.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.125
But different this time.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.082
Different?

02:51.083 --> 02:52.084
I hurt them.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.522
So they're angry.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.439
They want revenge.

02:58.526 --> 03:01.268
At least give me a chance
to fix this, Alec, please.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.184
Why?

03:06.838 --> 03:08.362
Because...

03:08.449 --> 03:09.928
Because I don't want to
see them hurt you again.

03:14.803 --> 03:15.673
This time...

03:16.848 --> 03:17.936
I won't let them.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.939
[roots creaking]

03:39.436 --> 03:41.917
[crumpling]

03:48.140 --> 03:49.620
[Jason sighs] I lost him.

03:51.622 --> 03:52.406
[exhales sharply]

03:58.107 --> 04:00.065
I know what you're thinking.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.763
They lost him.

04:04.026 --> 04:07.508
But I should've known better
than to depend on mercenaries

04:07.595 --> 04:11.076
or corporate men,
all of 'em barely competent.

04:11.163 --> 04:13.296
Oh...

04:13.383 --> 04:15.298
All my life,
people who don't understand

04:15.385 --> 04:16.734
interfere with my work...

04:20.303 --> 04:24.742
but we will not be
disturbed here, my love.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.575
[theme music playing]

05:32.680 --> 05:34.290
[Liz] Did you find him?

05:34.377 --> 05:36.684
He went to the cove
like you said he was going to.

05:37.424 --> 05:38.294
And?

05:40.383 --> 05:42.603
He found his body in the water.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.169
Oh, my God.

05:44.256 --> 05:47.477
Not his... Not his own.
It was Alec's body,

05:47.564 --> 05:50.132
but it was not...
It was, um... I...

05:53.265 --> 05:54.092
[gasps]

05:55.224 --> 05:57.531
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

05:57.618 --> 06:00.838
I, you know...
I thought, Liz, that

06:00.925 --> 06:03.493
I could help him,

06:03.580 --> 06:04.842
that I could cure him.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.628
And I can't.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.194
I can't help in thinking that
I've lost him.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.066
I've lost him,
I've lost him like everyone.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.415
But it's not your fault.

06:12.502 --> 06:13.808
You've done
everything you could.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.766
But, Liz, it is, it is.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.725
It wasn't enough.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.379
It was not enough.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.034
I have to protect him.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.775
Yeah. Of course.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.172
Okay. So...

06:30.259 --> 06:32.609
So we need to figure out
who's behind Avery and Woodrue.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.306
-Yes.
-There's no way

06:34.394 --> 06:35.830
Sunderland organized that shit
on the cement plant

06:35.917 --> 06:37.353
-on his own.
-No.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.007
And those men in Atlanta

06:39.094 --> 06:40.878
had something to do with it.
I know it.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.227
What I don't understand

06:42.314 --> 06:43.968
is why they would've chosen
a building

06:44.055 --> 06:44.969
that Maria Sunderland owned,

06:45.056 --> 06:45.970
-that--
-Well,

06:46.884 --> 06:48.408
it looks like she

06:48.495 --> 06:51.889
got herself into something
really messy and...

06:51.976 --> 06:54.718
landed on somebody's bad side.
You haven't heard.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.764
What... what haven't I heard?

06:56.851 --> 07:00.376
Maria's locked up
on a psychiatric hold
at the Barclay Institute.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.598
Avery.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.904
Oh, my God. That isn't...
That is...

07:06.991 --> 07:09.124
That's no coincidence, Liz.
I have to talk to her.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.648
She knows who those men are.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.302
You think
she's gonna talk to you?

07:13.389 --> 07:14.738
I think she's going to have to.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.663
Lizzy.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.755
I'll catch you later, Pops.
I got to... I got to
go see a friend.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.196
[Jason] I know
this must be, uh...

07:38.283 --> 07:42.113
unsettling for you, my darling.

07:42.200 --> 07:46.640
You're experiencing
what's known as
locked-in syndrome.

07:46.727 --> 07:50.818
And it's brought on by
a medication overdose.

07:50.905 --> 07:53.124
You've lost
muscle control and...

07:53.211 --> 07:56.171
it's leaving your body frozen,
but with...

07:56.258 --> 07:58.173
with cognition intact.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.093
Can you blink once
if you understand?

08:11.273 --> 08:12.883
I let you down, my love.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.671
I wasn't there
when you needed me, but...

08:19.847 --> 08:21.805
I am going to...

08:21.892 --> 08:24.068
fix all that today.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.635
I am going to fix all that.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.684
Now the creature may be gone,
but, uh...

08:30.771 --> 08:31.554
but, uh...

08:33.077 --> 08:34.644
I still have him.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.254
Um...

08:36.341 --> 08:37.952
Or more precisely,

08:38.039 --> 08:39.127
his organs.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.959
Crude, plant approximations.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.047
Liver.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.269
There's lungs.

08:52.967 --> 08:53.750
And...

08:58.581 --> 09:00.104
[exhales]

09:00.191 --> 09:01.105
The heart.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.936
Their regenerative
properties will

09:06.023 --> 09:07.808
infuse your cells,

09:07.895 --> 09:10.637
repair them
and bring you back to me.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.815
Just as I always promised,
my love.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.475
[indistinct chatter]

09:36.010 --> 09:38.534
Creature's trail leads
deep into the swamp.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.797
Make no mistake,
that's where it thrives.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.669
Yeah, we all
read the brief, Ellery.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.322
The real question here is

09:44.409 --> 09:46.063
what are the rules
of engagement with this thing?

09:46.150 --> 09:47.587
I'm letting you off the leash.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.459
This thing's cost me
too many good men.

09:50.546 --> 09:53.201
Kill it.
We'll harvest what we can
from the thing's corpse.

10:07.868 --> 10:08.651
Ellery.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.350
Good to finally meet you.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.483
-Sunderland.
-That's right.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.963
Listen, I think you better
tell your men
to take it easy, okay?

10:16.050 --> 10:17.791
Because if you kill Holland,

10:17.878 --> 10:19.706
my entire project
could go down the drain.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.360
Your project?

10:22.447 --> 10:25.102
Yeah. My project.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.801
I got my whole life wrapped up
in seeing this through.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.977
My instincts tell me
that what he's gonna do--

10:30.064 --> 10:31.456
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the--

10:34.068 --> 10:36.505
Last time we followed
your goddamn instincts,

10:36.592 --> 10:38.768
we took multiple casualties.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.378
You and me...

10:40.465 --> 10:42.206
got a deal, Ellery.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.513
A deal that didn't close

10:44.600 --> 10:45.862
because you got yourself

10:45.949 --> 10:48.560
half-killed in this
filthy swamp.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.866
What the hell
are you talking about?

10:50.998 --> 10:52.956
That you went out on the water

10:53.043 --> 10:54.784
with your girlfriend sheriff,

10:54.871 --> 10:56.264
and came out a day later

10:56.351 --> 10:59.354
looking like
ten miles of bad road.

10:59.441 --> 11:02.139
Yeah. We've had eyes on you
for days.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.233
-Hey, you are not cutting me...
-Hey.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.279
[grunting] Shit.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.150
You are not
cutting me out, Ellery!

11:14.195 --> 11:15.718
Might not be up to me

11:15.805 --> 11:17.633
the way your sheriff
is coming after you.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.550
You get your damn house
in order, Sunderland.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.117
Then, maybe we'll talk.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.080
Doctor,

11:30.167 --> 11:31.734
I just got a call
about my son, Matt.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.736
-He's been in an accident.
-He's gonna be all right.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.477
And he's got out of Radiology.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.218
[stammering]

11:37.305 --> 11:39.176
What the hell happened?

11:39.263 --> 11:41.048
It looks like
he went off the road
sometime last night,

11:41.135 --> 11:43.180
but his car wasn't spotted
until this morning.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.356
I'd like to keep him overnight
as a precaution.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.662
[Lucilia sighs]

11:46.749 --> 11:47.837
When can I see him?

11:47.924 --> 11:49.273
As soon as he's brought down.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.711
Lucilia...

11:51.798 --> 11:52.755
you should know...

11:57.804 --> 11:59.806
It was a one-car accident...

11:59.893 --> 12:02.373
and the paramedics found
opened bottles in his car.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.812
He was drunk?

12:05.899 --> 12:08.423
Well, lucky for Matt,
there's no legal proof of that.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.685
But it sure looks that way.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.125
Daniel, are you here?

12:15.212 --> 12:16.170
[heavy metal music playing]

12:18.259 --> 12:19.086
Daniel?

12:20.652 --> 12:21.479
Hello?

12:30.967 --> 12:31.751
[thudding]

12:32.926 --> 12:34.057
Danny, is that you?

12:36.843 --> 12:37.844
Daniel?

12:42.283 --> 12:43.501
-Hey!
-Hey!

12:44.938 --> 12:46.200
What's with the music?

12:46.287 --> 12:47.984
I can't stop hearing it.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.160
It's this buzzing,
it's inside my head.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.771
-This voice.
-[Liz scoffs]

12:51.858 --> 12:53.381
What do you mean? What voice?

12:55.383 --> 12:57.646
His voice. The Blue Devil.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.996
I thought the Blue Devil
was a character in a movie.

13:00.083 --> 13:03.304
He's inside my head.
And he's been leaving me
these images that are...

13:03.391 --> 13:04.218
Liz,

13:05.349 --> 13:06.742
am I going crazy?

13:06.829 --> 13:09.440
I know you, Daniel.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.268
And I know
if it weren't for you,

13:11.355 --> 13:12.400
I wouldn't be standing here.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.056
Abby, too.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.710
Well, your friend,
she's special, you know,
Dr. Arcane.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.713
How? Why? I'm not sure,

13:21.801 --> 13:25.065
but there's a reason
she came back to Marais.

13:25.152 --> 13:29.330
Just as there's a reason
why I had to stay around
all these years.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.028
But now you've
run out of reasons.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.029
Yeah, well...

13:34.639 --> 13:36.076
You know, it's funny.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.860
All I ever wanted
since landing here

13:37.947 --> 13:39.383
was to blow this town,

13:39.470 --> 13:42.125
get back to LA, lie on a beach.

13:42.212 --> 13:45.433
Now, suddenly that dream seems
awfully small.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.478
Kind of like...

13:47.565 --> 13:50.438
Kind of like I got
a bigger destiny going on here.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.222
I know the feeling.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.398
But do you really think this is
the way to figure it out?

13:54.485 --> 13:57.140
I just know
I need to hit the road.
I got to get out of here.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.576
I got to find my path.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.362
Look, Liz,

14:02.711 --> 14:04.147
look after the shop
for me, okay?

14:06.454 --> 14:07.411
Come here.

14:25.342 --> 14:28.128
[breathing heavily]

14:44.796 --> 14:46.189
[screaming]

14:51.803 --> 14:54.632
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

15:04.164 --> 15:06.383
What are you giving me?
I can't think.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.907
[breathing heavily]
What are you doing to me?

15:12.215 --> 15:14.826
I shouldn't be the one
locked up in here.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.916
You should be
the one in here, Avery!

15:17.003 --> 15:18.961
-[indistinct shouting]
-No.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.920
[indistinct whispers
and talking]

15:22.573 --> 15:23.357
[woman]  Listen.

15:24.314 --> 15:28.623
[indistinct conversation]

15:28.710 --> 15:29.667
[man]  Maria!

15:30.799 --> 15:31.669
What's wrong?

15:31.756 --> 15:32.844
What do you want from me?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.890
[indistinct chatter]

15:41.114 --> 15:43.116
[woman shushing]

15:44.247 --> 15:47.598
[indistinct voices continue]

15:47.685 --> 15:50.123
[voices become louder
and more sinister]

15:58.653 --> 16:00.524
[screaming]

16:04.354 --> 16:05.877
Maria, open your eyes.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.098
[Maria] Nimue. How did you...

16:09.185 --> 16:11.535
I heard your cries.
I can tell you're in pain.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.059
[sniffles]

16:13.146 --> 16:15.061
Can you make it stop?

16:15.148 --> 16:16.018
I can't.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.021
You tapped into a dark power

16:19.108 --> 16:21.197
trying to see
your daughter again,

16:21.284 --> 16:23.025
trying to see Shawna.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.245
Now those demons
are coming out.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.551
No.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.205
They've corrupted you...

16:30.728 --> 16:33.818
causing you
to do terrible things.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.211
But you're here now.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.779
You can make it stop.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.390
I can offer you some peace,

16:40.477 --> 16:42.479
the grace you crave.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.003
But I have to warn you,

16:46.353 --> 16:49.312
it's a peace from which
you may never return.

17:28.873 --> 17:29.700
See this?

17:32.442 --> 17:33.487
Tracks are fresh.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.927
Ah, he's nearby. Stay alert.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.278
We're losing light.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.628
Tell me you have a plan
to find this thing.

17:44.715 --> 17:45.977
Yeah, I got a plan.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.457
One man's gonna flush him out,

17:47.544 --> 17:49.416
we'll surround him,
come in on him.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.113
Trust me, Ellery.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.550
Your target's not making it
out of here in one piece.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.030
Team leader?

17:55.117 --> 17:57.554
Yeah, Romero. Shaw. Come in.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.991
[Romero on radio]
If this thing's close,
I'll drive him your way.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.297
Well, all right then.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.255
Copy.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.127
Okay. Let's keep moving.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.172
Follow me.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.966
[twigs crackling]

18:22.753 --> 18:23.711
[twig breaks]

18:31.371 --> 18:32.850
[Romero on radio]  Shaw,
something's close,

18:32.937 --> 18:34.287
but I haven't got
eyes on it yet.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.509
[breathing heavily]

18:40.945 --> 18:42.121
I know you're out there.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.849
[twigs breaking]

19:19.027 --> 19:20.768
[gunfire continues]

19:23.597 --> 19:24.641
[gun clicking]

19:30.952 --> 19:33.259
[low growl]

19:37.741 --> 19:39.700
-[screaming]
-[growling]

19:40.614 --> 19:42.398
Romero, report.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.229
-Maria.
-Abigail?

19:49.275 --> 19:50.232
What are you doing here?

19:51.233 --> 19:52.582
I'm here for Maria.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.412
To free her from her pain.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.157
Maria.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.160
Isn't she so beautiful?

20:07.510 --> 20:10.818
My beautiful daughter
has finally come back to me.

20:10.905 --> 20:14.604
[laughs softly]

20:14.691 --> 20:17.390
Maria, there's no one there.
There's no one there.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.090
[continues laughing]

20:22.177 --> 20:25.093
Avery Sunderland is the one
who can help you now, child.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.707
Let her be.

20:48.899 --> 20:51.250
[laughing softly]

20:55.036 --> 20:55.950
Oh.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.781
Promise me
that you'll stay with me.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.305
I promise.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.832
Forever and ever.

21:20.670 --> 21:21.845
[grunts softly]

21:23.456 --> 21:25.153
Delroy, another one.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.389
What's the matter,
my money's no good now?

21:43.476 --> 21:45.826
Just haven't seen you here
in a while is all.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.784
I bet you've been
all broke up about that, huh?

21:49.569 --> 21:51.701
Ah...

21:51.788 --> 21:55.139
Yeah, it seems like
I'm about to run out of friends
in this town.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.405
Can't say I'm surprised.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.192
I'll land on my feet.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.977
I always have.

22:07.064 --> 22:09.023
The people around here,
they understand.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.677
The people around here
understand that

22:10.764 --> 22:12.722
they know that
I've always been here for them,

22:12.809 --> 22:15.899
and I know that they will
always be here for me,

22:15.986 --> 22:18.641
that's just the way it goes.
I know it's true.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.340
I just... I just got to...

22:21.427 --> 22:24.081
got to regroup is all,
just gonna make a...

22:24.168 --> 22:25.561
Figure out my next move,
you know.

22:27.650 --> 22:31.045
How about your next move is
catching a cab and going home?

22:31.132 --> 22:33.787
[sighing] I still own
this damn place.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.919
And I'll sit here
till I'm damn good and ready.

22:37.486 --> 22:38.922
[Avery] Who the...

22:41.577 --> 22:43.231
Kind of jumpy there, Avery.

22:43.318 --> 22:44.450
You expecting someone?

22:53.720 --> 22:55.374
You seen the sheriff
around today?

22:57.114 --> 22:59.290
I imagine
she's at the hospital.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.598
Matty was in
some kind of accident
last night.

23:02.685 --> 23:05.166
Matt was in an accident
last night?

23:05.253 --> 23:06.950
What kind of an accident?
Car thing?

23:16.177 --> 23:17.396
Jesus Christ.

23:20.529 --> 23:21.617
That poor kid is...

23:24.577 --> 23:25.621
Delroy...

23:32.062 --> 23:32.889
Nothing.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.457
Thanks for the drink.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.075
I know this sounds strange,
but, uh,

23:45.162 --> 23:47.861
this reminds me
a little of our first date.

23:47.948 --> 23:52.561
I, uh, I made you dinner,
remember? [chuckles softly]

23:52.648 --> 23:55.390
I had never made dinner
for anyone before.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.567
I just wanted everything to be
just perfect.

24:00.787 --> 24:04.704
Given time, I would test
each of these organs
in isolation,

24:04.791 --> 24:08.098
but under the circumstances,
I think we should just

24:08.185 --> 24:10.753
hit you up with
all the artillery at once,

24:10.840 --> 24:14.104
releasing your body
from imprisonment and...

24:14.191 --> 24:16.846
[sighing] Eradicating
all traces of Alzheimer's.

24:19.936 --> 24:23.287
It smells surprisingly good,
doesn't it?

24:25.159 --> 24:26.465
It's his heart, he said.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.469
Preliminary tests
showed that it carries

24:30.556 --> 24:33.297
the highest concentration
of mutagenic activity.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.916
[breathing heavily]

24:43.003 --> 24:43.830
Hmm.

24:44.961 --> 24:46.049
Hmm.

24:48.617 --> 24:49.575
It's quite good.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.231
Oh, please,
you don't think that I would...

24:54.318 --> 24:55.929
[breathing heavily]

24:56.016 --> 24:58.671
I would subject you to
an untested treatment.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.716
No. Not before
I tried it myself.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.239
[chuckles softly]

25:02.326 --> 25:05.025
[breathing heavily]

25:09.943 --> 25:11.335
From what I could see

25:11.422 --> 25:14.338
from examining
the creature, the...

25:15.688 --> 25:17.516
regenerative process
began quite--

25:19.213 --> 25:20.083
[clanging]

25:21.955 --> 25:23.522
[gagging]

25:25.436 --> 25:27.787
[groaning]

25:33.183 --> 25:34.445
[Shaw] Romero!

25:39.189 --> 25:40.321
Romero!

25:45.718 --> 25:47.197
Where the hell did he go?

25:47.284 --> 25:48.808
[thunder rumbling]

25:58.078 --> 25:59.253
It's Romero's scarf.

26:04.519 --> 26:06.260
[Ellery] Oh, my God!

26:06.347 --> 26:08.001
[woman] Up there. Look!

26:08.871 --> 26:10.046
Is that Romero?

26:15.617 --> 26:17.140
[Ellery] This is bad.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.533
I think we should leave.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.057
-[rustling]
-[exclaims]

26:21.144 --> 26:22.711
[Ellery] I think
we should leave right now.

26:27.673 --> 26:30.589
Hey, where's the path?
This where we came in, right?

26:30.676 --> 26:31.590
What the...

26:34.331 --> 26:36.551
Pretty sure he's using Romero

26:36.638 --> 26:38.684
-as bait.
-Bait?

26:38.771 --> 26:41.121
[Ellery] It's a fucking trap
and we walked right into it.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.037
We're not hunting it...

26:44.124 --> 26:46.343
It's hunting us.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.649
-[Swamp Thing snarling]
-Shit!

26:49.085 --> 26:50.130

26:57.790 --> 26:58.617

27:01.881 --> 27:02.708
[Ellery] Right there!
Right there!

Oh! Oh, my God, what is this?

27:08.496 --> 27:11.020

[grunts]

27:29.343 --> 27:32.128
[breathing heavily]

27:36.698 --> 27:40.310
I can feel it, it's amazing.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.095
[rumbling]

27:53.149 --> 27:55.325
[thunder rumbling]

28:05.205 --> 28:06.815
[Abby] Avery?

28:06.902 --> 28:08.687
I didn't mean to
frighten you, my love.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.647
I've never
felt like this before.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.910
I know it sounds strange,
but I feel like I'm...

28:16.129 --> 28:19.306
somehow a part of nature and...

28:20.307 --> 28:21.569
plants around us.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.537
Dr. Arcane.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.105
Oh, my God.
Caroline, are you okay?

28:36.192 --> 28:37.846
-Caroline--
-I'm having
a private conversation

28:37.933 --> 28:39.674
with my wife,
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd...

28:40.936 --> 28:42.329
Did she take all of these?

28:42.416 --> 28:44.853
It's none of your business.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.115
'Cause she could've overdosed.
She needs to go the hospital,
she needs to be treated.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.290
Caroline, look at me.
Look at me.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.857
I am about to treat her

28:48.944 --> 28:50.250
with something
that actually works,

28:50.337 --> 28:52.252
but I really need you
to go now, okay?

28:52.339 --> 28:53.949
[Abby] Your...

28:54.036 --> 28:56.299
Your wife needs
medical attention, Dr. Woodrue.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.780
Hi, yes. I need--

28:58.867 --> 29:00.651
-What? Jason! What--
-[dispatcher on phone]  Hello?
Hello? Are you there?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.088
-What are you doing?
-[Jason] Leave it.
It's all right.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.742
It's all right. It's okay.
Just sit down.

29:03.829 --> 29:04.830
[Abby gasps]

29:05.700 --> 29:07.093
What are you doing?

29:07.180 --> 29:09.791
Trying to help my wife.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.358
I won't allow you
or anyone else

29:11.445 --> 29:13.186
to keep me from saving her.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.542
[thunder rumbling]

29:26.242 --> 29:27.026
[Lucilia] Matty...

29:28.984 --> 29:30.812
I'm so, so sorry, honey.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.206
[Avery] Matt's a fighter.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.076
[gun cocking]

29:37.514 --> 29:39.038
How did you crawl back?

29:39.125 --> 29:41.910
Lucilia, I come in peace.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.390
Get the hell out of this room.

30:06.065 --> 30:09.068
What kind of angle
are you working here, Avery?

30:09.155 --> 30:12.114
-Angle?
-After everything
that's happened,

30:12.201 --> 30:14.247
Matt tried to kill you,
you expect me to believe

30:14.334 --> 30:15.814
that you crawled
out of the swamp

30:15.901 --> 30:18.033
and now you're gonna
forgive him?

30:18.120 --> 30:21.210
You tell me a son
that hadn't dreamt
of killing his father

30:21.297 --> 30:22.951
at one point or another.

30:23.038 --> 30:25.214
A son can hate his father

30:25.301 --> 30:28.087
and it's the father's job
to forgive.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.393
I've been thinking...

30:31.568 --> 30:32.787
I'm seeing something here.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.713
Craziest you've seen, kid.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.151
Though normal may seem
crazy, anyway.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.892
There's a silver lining

30:50.979 --> 30:52.720
behind all this mess.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.419
If you knew I was back,

30:57.203 --> 30:59.248
you also heard

30:59.335 --> 31:02.164
Maria's been having some
serious mental issues

31:02.251 --> 31:04.906
and I'm afraid the prognosis
is not good.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.473
And I imagine...

31:08.736 --> 31:10.694
we'll be divorced soon.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.742
What are you saying?

31:15.569 --> 31:16.570
I'm saying...

31:20.356 --> 31:22.097
we can finally be together...

31:26.885 --> 31:28.364
We can make

31:28.451 --> 31:29.757
a fresh start.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.979
You, me...

31:35.632 --> 31:36.590
our son.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.727
You stabbed our son,
you evil son of a bitch.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.860
You turned our son

31:45.947 --> 31:49.603
into a murderer,
and you are gonna rot in hell
for that, Avery.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.130
And with any kind of luck,
I'm gonna be the one
who sends you there.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.396
You stay away from Matt,

32:00.483 --> 32:02.268
and you stay away from me.

32:14.541 --> 32:17.979
Can you please at least
try to explain to me

32:18.066 --> 32:20.634
what it is
that you're trying to do
with these plans?

32:20.721 --> 32:24.116
The material that I harvested
is completely unique.

32:26.118 --> 32:29.904
It doesn't appear anywhere else
in the entire world.

32:29.991 --> 32:33.560
Except for the swamps
of Marais.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.257
That... That you harvested?

32:37.477 --> 32:39.914
That I saved,
to complete my work.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.570
Those parts are from Alec?

32:43.657 --> 32:44.527
Abby, there...

32:45.572 --> 32:47.748
there is no Alec.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.880
I don't care
what you think you saw,

32:49.968 --> 32:51.404
he is still alive
in there somewhere,

32:51.491 --> 32:53.406
and you ignored that.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.625
You ripped him from the swamp
and tore him open

32:55.712 --> 32:58.193
like he was some kind of
science experiment, Doctor.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.282
There is no him.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.937
It's a plant
with regenerative properties

33:03.024 --> 33:05.461
that I'm going to use
to help save my wife.

33:05.548 --> 33:06.897
-This is insane.
-No.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.117
-This is insane.
-No, it isn't. No.

33:09.204 --> 33:09.988
It's...

33:11.163 --> 33:12.164
It's a miracle.

33:14.557 --> 33:15.384
Hmm.

33:16.777 --> 33:17.952
All right, my love.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.348
Regrow your cells.

33:22.435 --> 33:27.135
Rewrite the neural pathways
of your brain.

33:27.222 --> 33:29.050
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

33:45.588 --> 33:47.634
[officer] 911 traced the call
back to your phone's GPS.

33:48.591 --> 33:49.679
Thank you.

33:49.766 --> 33:52.334

-[Jason groaning]

33:57.035 --> 33:58.775
Oh.

33:58.862 --> 34:01.561
Don't take her, don't take her.
Don't take her. Please.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.780
Don't...

[Shaw grunts]

34:13.616 --> 34:15.618
Shaw, this isn't working!

34:17.011 --> 34:18.230
Hell it is.

34:19.535 --> 34:20.493
All right.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.539
You got us where you want us.

34:25.237 --> 34:27.065
Why don't you show yourself?

34:33.158 --> 34:34.550
[vines creaking]

34:40.382 --> 34:41.775
What do we do?

34:41.862 --> 34:45.257
Shaw, hold on, okay? Hold on.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.476
That son of a bitch
killed Romero!

34:47.563 --> 34:48.912
[gunfire]

34:50.392 --> 34:51.176
[groans]

34:59.488 --> 35:01.490
It's coming from over there!
Fire!

35:01.577 --> 35:03.231

35:15.200 --> 35:16.201

35:33.522 --> 35:35.045
Ah! Ah!

35:35.133 --> 35:35.959
[snarling]

35:42.401 --> 35:44.664
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:50.931 --> 35:52.933
Heard the call go out
over the police scanner.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.413
What the hell happened?

35:56.110 --> 35:58.068
It's Jason Woodrue,
he just, uh...

35:59.766 --> 36:01.159
I don't know, he lost his mind.

36:02.682 --> 36:05.641
Seems to be a lot of that
going around lately.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.904
[Jason breathing heavily]
Where is my wife?

36:07.991 --> 36:08.949
Where's my wife?

36:10.124 --> 36:11.995
Abby! Abby.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.607
You can't do this.
You can't do this.

36:14.694 --> 36:17.131
Caroline! Caroline,
I'll find you.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.351
I'll find you, don't be afraid.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.700
I'll find you.

36:38.935 --> 36:39.980
[Matt shudders]

36:42.765 --> 36:43.549
[Lucilia] Hey.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.859
Bad dream?

36:49.946 --> 36:51.339
No, actually it was a good one.

36:54.690 --> 36:56.605
I was a kid again
at the old house.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.609
Running around in the backyard
with you and Dad.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.481
[Lucilia] Hmm.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.309
The nurse said
I had a visitor earlier.

37:07.486 --> 37:08.965
So Avery survived.

37:13.753 --> 37:14.797
He was here.

37:16.321 --> 37:17.844
You know the sick thing?
I'm glad.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.978
I'd rather have him alive

37:22.065 --> 37:23.066
than have to live with
the guilt of killing
another man.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.112
No. Now, do not take this on.

37:25.199 --> 37:28.071
-No, this is on me--
-No, this is on me.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.030
I've been keeping Avery
a secret from you

37:30.117 --> 37:32.337
for all these years
when I should've just
trusted you

37:32.424 --> 37:34.469
to be the man I always knew
you could be.

37:37.385 --> 37:40.649
I just, I feel so ashamed
of so many things
that I've done.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.436
You're all I have.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.829
You know,
you are everything to me.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.398
And the love I have for you,

37:51.530 --> 37:53.096
that is never a lie.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.318
Ma, you don't
have to tell me that.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.713
I promise you...

38:00.800 --> 38:03.716
we are gonna see our way
through this to the other side.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.894
I'm guessing that
you should go home.

38:12.072 --> 38:12.899
Okay.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.515
I'll get you some fresh clothes
for the morning.

38:37.706 --> 38:38.490
Jansen,

38:39.752 --> 38:41.188
no stepping out.

38:41.275 --> 38:43.843
While I'm gone, doctors only,
no visitors.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.148
Okay? You stay close.

38:45.235 --> 38:46.411
Do you understand?

38:51.241 --> 38:52.678
I love you, Matthew Leroy.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.528
[woman coughing]

39:20.314 --> 39:21.141
[car beeps]

39:46.993 --> 39:48.211
God, I loved you.

39:51.214 --> 39:52.215
[Lucilia] Avery.

39:52.302 --> 39:55.088
[Lucilia gasps]

39:55.175 --> 39:58.961
I'm sorry I could never
be with you
like you always wanted.

40:00.223 --> 40:01.573
One of us has to die.

40:03.879 --> 40:05.707
One of us has to die.

40:17.850 --> 40:19.982

Oh, my God.

[Lucilia groans]

41:06.246 --> 41:07.726
Help! Help!

41:08.378 --> 41:10.380
Help me!

41:10.468 --> 41:12.470
Help me!

41:17.387 --> 41:19.955
[muffled screams]

41:22.218 --> 41:24.699
Help!

41:24.786 --> 41:26.701
Help me!

41:27.267 --> 41:28.790
Help me!

41:33.969 --> 41:35.710
[gasping]

41:36.929 --> 41:38.583
Help me!

[coughing intensifies]

42:33.986 --> 42:34.769
What the fuck?

42:38.817 --> 42:39.600
Oh!

42:44.562 --> 42:45.650
[gasps]

42:45.737 --> 42:46.955
No, wait. Wait, wait.

42:48.130 --> 42:49.479
I can help you.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.873
I can help you. Okay?

42:51.960 --> 42:53.919
And with these
regenerative abilities,

42:54.006 --> 42:57.139
you could do so much
for so many people.

42:57.226 --> 42:58.967

-[Swamp Thing grunts]

43:00.273 --> 43:02.623
[moans]

43:02.710 --> 43:05.104
People captured me.

43:05.191 --> 43:08.890
People made me watch
while they pulled out my heart.

43:10.936 --> 43:13.155
Holland, I have a plan.

43:13.242 --> 43:15.027
I am not Alec Holland!

43:15.114 --> 43:16.637
You showed me this.

43:17.507 --> 43:18.900
Okay.

43:18.987 --> 43:21.424
You could do so much
for all of humanity.

43:21.511 --> 43:23.775
Why would I help you?

43:26.255 --> 43:28.606
Tell the others
what you saw here today.

43:28.693 --> 43:30.999
Tell them
what I am capable of.

43:31.086 --> 43:32.566
Tell them...

43:32.653 --> 43:35.482
to leave me alone!

43:35.569 --> 43:36.614
[Ellery whimpers]

[roaring]

43:51.933 --> 43:53.805
[breathing deeply]

44:02.770 --> 44:03.815
[Alec] Feel better now?

44:10.299 --> 44:11.300
Go away.

44:12.084 --> 44:13.172
You're dead.

44:17.611 --> 44:19.178
[Alec chuckles]

44:19.265 --> 44:20.658
[Alec] "Go away. You're dead."

44:22.311 --> 44:24.226
Physically, yes, but...

44:25.706 --> 44:27.577
up here,
I'm still hanging around.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.449
I can't keep going on
like this.

44:31.016 --> 44:33.061
[sighing] I know.

44:35.934 --> 44:37.805
Maybe I belong away
from people.

44:39.111 --> 44:40.590
Out there in the green.

44:40.678 --> 44:41.722
Is that our plan?

44:43.028 --> 44:45.900
Hmm? Because we're
a monster, right?

44:45.987 --> 44:47.772
They don't see me as a human.

44:48.860 --> 44:50.862
Just as a thing.

44:50.949 --> 44:52.254
Yeah, most do.

44:54.256 --> 44:55.127
Except one.

44:55.997 --> 44:57.346
Abby.

44:57.433 --> 44:59.305
If we leave her,

44:59.392 --> 45:02.743
we lose
the only human connection
we ever had.

45:02.830 --> 45:05.224
And then, we really are
just this thing.

45:05.311 --> 45:07.008
And if we stay for her,
what then?

45:07.922 --> 45:08.749
I don't know.

45:10.403 --> 45:11.709
There's no guarantees.

45:13.058 --> 45:14.059
But then there never were.

45:16.583 --> 45:19.847
Yeah, you've been trying
so hard to become me again,
but it's...

45:19.934 --> 45:21.806
it's not about me anymore,
we both know that.

45:22.937 --> 45:24.330
Alec Holland is gone.

45:25.244 --> 45:26.419
But the question is...

45:28.943 --> 45:30.249
who do you want to be?

45:36.995 --> 45:39.693
-[thunder rumbling]
-[rain pattering]

46:38.056 --> 46:39.274
[Swamp Thing]
Why did you come back?

46:57.727 --> 46:59.773
I...

46:59.860 --> 47:02.732
I had to see you, I had to know
that you're all right.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.952
Alec Holland is gone.

47:05.039 --> 47:07.215
There's nothing you can do
to change that.

47:07.302 --> 47:08.826
I'm not here to try.

47:08.913 --> 47:10.044
Then why?

47:12.046 --> 47:14.005
[stammers] Because I care...

47:14.744 --> 47:16.964
about you.

47:17.051 --> 47:19.358
And not just the way
you were before, but now.

47:22.013 --> 47:23.971
I understand how hard
this must've been for you,

47:24.058 --> 47:27.409
but suddenly
you're open to worlds
that I never knew existed.

47:27.496 --> 47:29.324
Dangerous worlds.

47:29.411 --> 47:31.370
Yes.

47:31.457 --> 47:32.893
Yes, there is darkness
out there,

47:32.980 --> 47:35.026
we've both seen it.
But through you,

47:35.113 --> 47:38.203
I've also seen
the beauty in this place.

47:38.290 --> 47:39.595
You've touched the green.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.250
Yeah, but only through you.

47:43.121 --> 47:45.123
I...

47:45.210 --> 47:48.126
I want to feel more, I...
I want to see more.

47:49.344 --> 47:50.693
[sighs]

47:52.217 --> 47:53.131
I was gonna leave.

47:55.481 --> 47:57.048
Lose myself
in the swamp forever.

48:01.791 --> 48:02.880
What stopped you?

48:07.754 --> 48:09.756
[breath trembling]

48:09.843 --> 48:11.323
The thought of
never seeing you again.

48:15.849 --> 48:17.416
Well, I guess, um...

48:19.809 --> 48:21.855
that's another thing
we have in common.

48:21.942 --> 48:22.769
[Swamp Thing chuckles]

48:31.473 --> 48:33.127
And I'd hide so much.

48:35.521 --> 48:37.262
Is there something out there?

48:37.349 --> 48:38.132
The darkness...

48:39.003 --> 48:40.178
it's still raging.

48:42.528 --> 48:44.225
Fighting to break free.

48:44.312 --> 48:45.444
Fighting to come out.

48:46.010 --> 48:46.836
Well,

48:49.056 --> 48:51.363
I'm not going anywhere,
so we'll face it together.

48:55.149 --> 48:56.194
How's that sound?

48:57.935 --> 48:59.719
I would like that very much.

50:07.134 --> 50:09.223
[Matt] Is anyone here?

50:09.310 --> 50:11.356
Look, I'm just
grabbing my stuff, all right?

50:16.970 --> 50:19.059
All right, Tyler,
stop fucking around.

50:21.366 --> 50:22.410
What's going on?

50:23.237 --> 50:24.238
Anyone?

50:25.239 --> 50:26.414
Mom, where are you?

50:29.548 --> 50:30.549
Ma?

50:33.508 --> 50:34.857
What the fuck happened here?

50:37.121 --> 50:38.252
What the hell?

50:45.738 --> 50:47.218
What is all this?

51:03.190 --> 51:04.235
Jesus.

51:13.331 --> 51:14.245
Tyler?

51:19.119 --> 51:20.642
[clattering]

51:43.012 --> 51:44.318
Is someone there?

51:55.677 --> 51:57.114
[snarling]

52:06.732 --> 52:07.863
Show yourself!

52:19.048 --> 52:21.529
[breathing heavily]

52:22.226 --> 52:24.663
Why Alec Holland

52:24.750 --> 52:27.274
so desperately wanted
to be human again?

52:30.625 --> 52:34.368
When the alternative
is infinitely
more intriguing.

52:35.543 --> 52:36.501
What are you?

52:37.719 --> 52:39.330
Well,

52:39.417 --> 52:41.767
I was Jason Woodrue.

52:43.247 --> 52:44.073
[breath trembles]

52:48.252 --> 52:49.688

-[gunshots]

52:49.775 --> 52:50.558
[Matt screaming]

52:51.646 --> 52:53.126
[growling]
