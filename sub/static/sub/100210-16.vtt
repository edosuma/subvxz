00:00.055 --> 00:02.023
<i>Back in the '90s, there was no teacher</i>

00:02.078 --> 00:04.187
<i>who looked out more for
the students of William Penn</i>

00:04.254 --> 00:05.281
<i>than Coach Mellor.</i>

00:05.359 --> 00:06.558
<i>Even outside of gym class,</i>

00:06.627 --> 00:08.660
<i>he was always there
to lend a helping hand.</i>

00:08.762 --> 00:10.962
<i>And he was constantly
pushing them to eat healthier</i>

00:11.031 --> 00:13.064
<i>and fuel their brains for learning.</i>

00:13.133 --> 00:15.700
<i>Yep, it was safe to say Coach loved
helping every kid at school.</i>

00:15.769 --> 00:16.801
Oh, I totally forgot.

00:16.870 --> 00:18.236
I have to get to the DMV
right after school,

00:18.338 --> 00:19.671
but Toby has Chess Club.

00:19.740 --> 00:23.274
Don't worry. Your knight will
move young Toby to Castle Julie.

00:23.343 --> 00:26.244
Another problem checkmated
by "Rook" Mellor.

00:26.346 --> 00:27.479
I love you,

00:27.547 --> 00:30.015
but sometimes I wish
you'd talk normally.

00:30.083 --> 00:32.450
<i>Yep, he and Toby were spending
more and more time together,</i>

00:32.552 --> 00:34.152
<i>and their relationship was blossoming.</i>

00:34.221 --> 00:36.488
Jeff Gordon hugs the corner!

00:36.556 --> 00:38.289
Crew Chief Toby, what's my next move?

00:38.392 --> 00:39.557
Uh, drive really fast!

00:39.626 --> 00:41.826
Takin' her up to 35, baby!

00:42.963 --> 00:44.729
Eat my dust, power walkers!

00:44.765 --> 00:47.132
<i>And Coach even lent his
style of help with homework.</i>

00:47.200 --> 00:49.567
As the Confederates blitzed
from both sides,

00:49.670 --> 00:51.636
the Union Army rushed up the middle.

00:51.705 --> 00:54.506
And just when you thought they'd
fumble at Gettysburg... Boom!

00:54.574 --> 00:58.009
The Union scooped up the loose
ball and took it to the house!

00:58.078 --> 00:59.435
Appomattox Courthouse.

00:59.489 --> 01:00.745
Suck it, Robert E. Lee!

01:00.814 --> 01:03.648
<i>It was clear Coach was becoming
more than just a coach to Toby,</i>

01:03.750 --> 01:05.083
<i>and Julie was thrilled.</i>

01:05.152 --> 01:07.018
<i>Until one day,
something happened at school</i>

01:07.076 --> 01:08.128
<i>that changed everything.</i>

01:08.201 --> 01:10.755
Okay, today we finish "Macbeth."

01:10.802 --> 01:12.223
It is the big final fight

01:12.292 --> 01:14.726
between our protagonist and Macduff.

01:14.828 --> 01:17.295
- The crime dog?
- That is McGruff.

01:17.397 --> 01:20.331
But we're gonna take a bite
out of Shakespeare

01:20.400 --> 01:22.400
with the help from our young thespians,

01:22.502 --> 01:23.802
Toby and Hunter!

01:23.870 --> 01:25.837
Just like we rehearsed, guys.
Here we go.

01:25.939 --> 01:29.374
"Of all men else I have avoided thee.

01:29.443 --> 01:31.142
But get thee back!

01:31.211 --> 01:34.846
My soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already!"

01:34.948 --> 01:35.980
Oh, snap!

01:36.049 --> 01:37.782
I know. Shakespeare gets me going, too.

01:37.851 --> 01:40.151
- What the hell's going on here?
- Inspiring my students, Rick.

01:40.253 --> 01:42.120
- To beat the crap out of each other?!
- Oh...

01:42.222 --> 01:44.516
Hey! This is not what we rehearsed!

01:44.955 --> 01:47.859
<i>♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪</i>

01:47.961 --> 01:50.829
<i>♪ Live your life and finally be free ♪</i>

01:50.931 --> 01:53.798
<i>♪ Go where you wanna go,

<i>♪ Someday, you will say

01:57.394 --> 01:59.433
<i>It was March 18th, 1990-something,</i>

01:59.495 --> 02:00.925
<i>and I was feeling overwhelmed</i>

02:01.003 --> 02:02.741
<i>by everything I had to do
for the music department.</i>

02:02.843 --> 02:03.842
Hi.

02:03.944 --> 02:05.009
Look at this schedule.

02:05.112 --> 02:06.611
It's jam-packed with classes.

02:06.713 --> 02:08.413
Leading jazz band. Quakers Dozen.

02:08.514 --> 02:10.181
And our musicals
have been so successful,

02:10.282 --> 02:12.350
Glascott wants us to do two this year.

02:12.452 --> 02:13.551
- Oh, please tell me one of them is...
- And no, neither of them are...

02:13.653 --> 02:14.822
..."You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown."

02:14.900 --> 02:16.421
- Darn!
- You gotta stop asking, buddy.

02:16.523 --> 02:17.489
Fine. For now.

02:17.591 --> 02:18.656
God, how did this happen?

02:18.759 --> 02:19.728
When I started here,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.693
all I taught was Music One
and Intro to the Recorder.

02:21.795 --> 02:23.094
Well, it happened 'cause of you.

02:23.196 --> 02:25.396
Since you started, you've inspired
so many kids to love music

02:25.499 --> 02:27.121
that everyone wants to get involved.

02:27.183 --> 02:29.734
I mean, look at you.
You are a rock star.

02:29.810 --> 02:30.810
Maybe in my younger days.

02:30.904 --> 02:32.370
Once a rock star, always a rock star.

02:32.472 --> 02:34.506
Well, we did open for
Terence Trent D'Arby once.

02:34.608 --> 02:35.940
Oh! TTD!

02:36.042 --> 02:39.110
Maybe I can move Show Choir
rehearsal to later in the day.

02:39.212 --> 02:41.379
Or you could ask one of us to cover
for you until you get there.

02:41.481 --> 02:43.248
Great idea. So, can I
count on you tomorrow?

02:43.350 --> 02:45.216
Can't. I got a podiatrist appointment.

02:45.318 --> 02:47.519
I've got this one toe...
I don't know what's going on,

02:47.621 --> 02:50.789
- but flip-flops are a no-can-do.
- Uh-huh.

02:53.293 --> 02:54.392
Hey, Wilma. You got a minute?

02:54.494 --> 02:56.261
Now that I got all these
chemicals cooking here,

02:56.363 --> 02:57.595
I have exactly that.

02:57.697 --> 02:59.264
Anything longer,
you're gonna wanna wear a mask.

02:59.366 --> 03:01.032
So, as you know,
I've been working really hard

03:01.134 --> 03:02.267
to expand the music program.

03:02.369 --> 03:03.701
So proud of you. 50 seconds left.

03:03.804 --> 03:05.470
Well, the music department's
become really busy,

03:05.572 --> 03:06.738
and I've got a lot on my plate,

03:06.840 --> 03:08.573
so can you cover the first half
of Show Choir this week?

03:08.675 --> 03:09.688
It's super easy.

03:09.782 --> 03:11.943
It's mostly just kids in sequin
vests singing soft rock hits

03:12.045 --> 03:13.812
while awkwardly stepping
from side-to-side.

03:13.914 --> 03:14.979
Sometimes snapping gently.

03:15.081 --> 03:16.581
I do love snapping. 15 seconds.

03:16.683 --> 03:17.816
I know you're super busy, too...

03:17.918 --> 03:19.951
I am. Ten seconds.
But don't worry. I got you.

03:20.053 --> 03:21.386
Thank you! You're such a good friend.

03:21.488 --> 03:23.588
I know. Three. Two.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.156
Oh, [bleep]! You're serious!

03:25.258 --> 03:27.325
<i>As I was racing out of Wilma's class,</i>

03:27.427 --> 03:28.726
<i>Julie and Coach were in the midst</i>

03:28.829 --> 03:30.228
<i>of some urgent business of their own.</i>

03:30.330 --> 03:31.663
I can't believe Toby got in a fight.

03:31.765 --> 03:33.131
The other kid had to have started it.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.433
Hunter has been known to be
somewhat of a bully.

03:35.535 --> 03:37.168
Please don't tell him I said that.

03:37.270 --> 03:40.705
CB was definitely playing with
fire when he handed him this.

03:40.807 --> 03:44.042
It's a novelty sword from the
Medieval Times dinner theater.

03:44.144 --> 03:47.071
Jousting, fair maidens,
a nice piece of meat.

03:47.141 --> 03:48.179
It's a good value.

03:48.281 --> 03:49.948
That's what I hear. I've been
meaning to check it out.

03:50.050 --> 03:51.482
You will not be disappointed.

03:51.585 --> 03:53.685
Hey, if you get a sword, I have a sword.

03:53.732 --> 03:54.652
We could actually have...

03:54.721 --> 03:56.487
- Can we get back to Toby?
- Sure. Sure.

03:56.556 --> 03:58.790
I'm glad he's okay, but what
are we gonna do about this?

03:58.859 --> 04:00.291
Maybe we should talk to Hunter's mom.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.861
Oh, no. That woman
is meaner than her son.

04:02.929 --> 04:04.362
Please don't tell her I said that.

04:04.431 --> 04:05.430
The solution is clear.

04:05.498 --> 04:07.031
Toby needs to learn
how to defend himself,

04:07.133 --> 04:08.533
and I would be happy to teach him.

04:08.602 --> 04:10.501
No, Rick, that is not the solution.

04:10.604 --> 04:11.569
Well, of course it is.

04:11.671 --> 04:13.104
This way,
the next time he gets picked on,

04:13.173 --> 04:15.874
he can strike back like a cobra
with lightning-quick fists.

04:15.976 --> 04:17.408
Well, cobras don't have fists, Rick.

04:17.476 --> 04:19.677
They don't need them, John.
They're nature's fist.

04:19.745 --> 04:22.196
Okay, enough.
I am firmly against fighting.

04:22.267 --> 04:23.381
I want Toby to be raised

04:23.450 --> 04:25.350
as a man of peace and non-violence.

04:25.418 --> 04:27.986
Well, as the proud principal of
a school founded by pacifists,

04:28.054 --> 04:29.921
I have to say... up top.

04:30.891 --> 04:31.990
He can stay peaceful

04:32.058 --> 04:34.659
while still learning
the fundamentals of kicking ass.

04:34.761 --> 04:35.960
I said no.

04:36.029 --> 04:37.562
John, I want Toby moved

04:37.664 --> 04:39.364
to a less aggressive English class.

04:39.432 --> 04:40.832
I don't know. They're all pretty rough.

04:40.934 --> 04:42.133
You can't do that.

04:42.202 --> 04:43.935
Because then he'll be the boy
whose aunt saved him.

04:44.004 --> 04:45.370
He'll get picked on even more.

04:45.438 --> 04:47.772
As Toby's legal guardian,
that's my decision.

04:47.874 --> 04:49.941
Because whatever happens
to Toby is on me.

04:50.043 --> 04:51.476
Hey, I care about him, too.

04:51.544 --> 04:52.677
We've really connected.

04:52.746 --> 04:55.647
We both hate snow pants
and mushrooms. He's my guy!

04:55.715 --> 04:57.382
Rick, I'm sorry,
but I have to go with the wishes

04:57.450 --> 04:58.516
of the legal guardian.

04:58.585 --> 05:01.119
I will move Toby to another class, okay?

05:01.187 --> 05:03.354
Now, if you two will excuse me,
I'd like for you to leave

05:03.423 --> 05:05.423
so that I can play with this sword.

05:05.525 --> 05:08.240
<i>Julie told Mellor not to
teach Toby about fighting,</i>

05:08.334 --> 05:10.169
<i>but, like always,
he just couldn't help himself.</i>

05:10.240 --> 05:11.262
All right, listen up!

05:11.364 --> 05:13.631
I know we're supposed to start
our kickball unit today,

05:13.733 --> 05:14.999
but Coach has called an audible,

05:15.101 --> 05:17.468
and today we'll be
diving into Taekwondo.

05:17.537 --> 05:19.570
A powerful discipline
of Korean martial arts

05:19.639 --> 05:23.247
first perfected by masters
Jong Chang and Cha Kyo Han.

05:23.310 --> 05:25.610
And then, of course,
made famous by Chuck Norris.

05:25.712 --> 05:26.978
Walker, Texas Ranger?

05:27.047 --> 05:29.514
Eh, he's more than that, Ed.
He's America's Ranger.

05:29.582 --> 05:31.616
But, Coach, Aunt Julie says
I'm not supposed to fight.

05:31.718 --> 05:32.850
And you're not.

05:32.919 --> 05:35.386
You're simply partaking
in a mandatory gym class,

05:35.455 --> 05:38.222
which today, randomly,
happens to be Taekwondo.

05:38.291 --> 05:39.724
Now, first, we will be learning

05:39.793 --> 05:42.226
how to obliterate
our opponent's rib cage,

05:42.295 --> 05:44.195
which we will simulate
with this particle board

05:44.297 --> 05:45.964
that I borrowed from the art department.

05:46.066 --> 05:47.465
Do not tell Mr. Granger.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.467
Okay. I need a volunteer.

05:50.870 --> 05:53.037
- Toby!
- He didn't even raise his hand!

05:53.106 --> 05:55.840
Ah, yes, but as Master Chang once said,

05:55.909 --> 05:59.577
the humble lotus blossom
that asks not for the rain

05:59.679 --> 06:02.513
is the first one to receive...

06:02.615 --> 06:04.082
the big drop.

06:04.184 --> 06:05.216
Get up here.

06:05.318 --> 06:06.551
Okay, Toby.

06:06.619 --> 06:09.721
You're gonna aim for a spot
past the board.

06:09.789 --> 06:11.155
All right, now focus.

06:11.257 --> 06:12.790
And strike!

06:12.892 --> 06:13.958
Hi-yah!

06:14.060 --> 06:16.294
Aah! Aah! Oh, my...

06:16.396 --> 06:17.595
You hurt your hand on this?

06:17.664 --> 06:20.131
It's basically a step above
a giant Nilla Wafer.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.432
Oh, my pinkie's puffing up.

06:21.501 --> 06:23.301
I better go see Aunt Julie
in the nurse's office.

06:23.370 --> 06:24.302
No! You can't.

06:24.404 --> 06:25.470
Uh...

06:25.572 --> 06:27.271
Because one of the first
principles of Taekwondo

06:27.374 --> 06:29.797
is we heal ourselves
without any outside help.

06:29.822 --> 06:30.752
But it hurts!

06:30.777 --> 06:33.011
We just need to find something to...

06:33.113 --> 06:35.251
immobilize it and... hide it.

06:36.606 --> 06:37.548
Perfect!

06:37.650 --> 06:39.083
Better. This might actually work.

06:39.185 --> 06:40.518
Ah, of course it'll work.

06:40.587 --> 06:44.022
As Master Chang said, "A true
warrior keeps his pain hidden...

06:44.090 --> 06:46.424
from his... aunt."

06:47.961 --> 06:49.427
<i>Marching band was over for the day,</i>

07:37.777 --> 07:39.343

07:39.446 --> 07:42.213

07:43.483 --> 07:44.482
Wow!

07:44.584 --> 07:45.783
Uh, I'm sorry.

07:45.852 --> 07:48.586
Is Linda Perry from
4 Non Blondes in the building?

07:48.688 --> 07:51.422
- Ms. Howell, that was awesome!
- Do you take requests?

07:51.524 --> 07:54.425
I have one... sing and don't
ever stop singing. Seriously.

07:54.527 --> 07:56.961
All right. Wilma needs to get going.

07:57.063 --> 07:58.996
You guys are so nice
to make her feel good.

07:59.099 --> 08:00.565
Not as good as she made us feel.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.934
Yeah. She's definitely
the best singer in the school.

08:03.036 --> 08:04.836
Oh. Like you've heard
everyone sing, Becky?

08:04.938 --> 08:06.471
Why are you even a science teacher?

08:06.573 --> 08:08.239
You should totally be a famous singer.

08:08.341 --> 08:09.607
I think it's safe to say

08:09.709 --> 08:11.943
that we're all better people
for having witnessed that.

08:12.045 --> 08:13.478
<i>And just like that,</i>

08:13.580 --> 08:16.747
<i>Wilma was suddenly
the rock star of the school.</i>

08:19.319 --> 08:21.586
If you're asking me for a catch,
I've been waiting for this day.

08:21.688 --> 08:23.488
I can't believe you went behind my back

08:23.590 --> 08:24.856
and taught him karate.

08:24.958 --> 08:26.090
It's Taekwondo.

08:26.192 --> 08:28.192
Completely different country.
Try to be sensitive.

08:28.294 --> 08:29.894
You know what this does, Rick?

08:29.996 --> 08:31.562
It makes me lose trust in you.

08:31.664 --> 08:34.065
I was only trying to teach Toby
how to defend himself in a fight.

08:34.167 --> 08:36.134
And I don't want Toby
to ever get in a fight.

08:36.236 --> 08:37.869
What are you gonna do...
roll him up in bubble wrap

08:37.971 --> 08:40.004
and keep him locked in his room
like some...

08:40.106 --> 08:42.405
tiny, short-haired boy Rapunzel?

08:42.509 --> 08:43.741
And what are you gonna do?

08:43.842 --> 08:46.110
Throw him into a cage match
and let him fight to the death?

08:46.212 --> 08:47.921
Well, first, I'd have him
watch "Bloodsport."

08:47.946 --> 08:48.990
Not some Norris vehicle.

08:49.015 --> 08:50.548
Jean-Claude Van Damme at his finest.

08:50.650 --> 08:52.617
Rick, stop trying to get Toby killed.

08:52.719 --> 08:54.285
I only had him
punch through some art supplies!

08:54.387 --> 08:55.753
Stop being so overprotective!

08:55.855 --> 08:57.288
Which is what I told you not to do.

08:57.390 --> 08:59.090
Stop being so under-protective!

08:59.192 --> 09:01.002
- Overprotective!
- Under-protective!

09:01.027 --> 09:02.111
- Over!
- Under!

09:02.138 --> 09:03.538
Hey, guys, I hope I'm not interrupting,

09:03.563 --> 09:06.130
but Medieval Times has one table
left for Saturday night.

09:06.158 --> 09:07.165
Are you in?

09:09.269 --> 09:11.469
I'm gonna put you down for a maybe...?

09:11.571 --> 09:12.703
Yeah?

09:13.436 --> 09:15.795
<i>I wasn't feeling like
the rock star I thought I was,</i>

09:15.868 --> 09:17.443
<i>so I was going to do what anybody</i>

09:17.514 --> 09:19.170
<i>who's threatened by
another band member would do...</i>

09:19.241 --> 09:20.373
<i>kick her ass out.</i>

09:20.475 --> 09:23.153
Hey. Thanks again
for covering Show Choir.

09:23.208 --> 09:24.440
Oh, no problem. I had a blast.

09:24.509 --> 09:26.215
I'm actually looking forward
to doing it again.

09:26.301 --> 09:27.500
You know, I can manage.

09:27.569 --> 09:29.769
You can go back
to your true passion... science.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.038
Rubber gloves and goggles
and long white coats.

09:32.106 --> 09:34.440
So, your knowledge of science
is mostly wardrobe-based.

09:34.467 --> 09:35.451
That's correct.

09:35.476 --> 09:36.642
But I thought you said you needed me

09:36.711 --> 09:37.843
to help cover Show Choir all week.

09:37.912 --> 09:39.612
Nope. I shifted some stuff around.

09:39.714 --> 09:41.480
I am gooood, good, good.

09:41.549 --> 09:43.470
Cool. I look forward to seeing the show.

09:43.495 --> 09:44.500
Okay, perfect.

09:44.525 --> 09:45.484
There's nothing I would love more

09:45.520 --> 09:48.020
than seeing you sitting quietly
in that audience.

09:48.089 --> 09:49.455
<i>With Wilma out of my spotlight,</i>

09:49.524 --> 09:51.290
<i>I got someone else to cover my class</i>

09:51.359 --> 09:53.226
<i>who I knew could never outshine me.</i>

09:55.897 --> 09:57.463
Right, guys?

09:58.800 --> 10:00.533
- Oh, hey, Lainey.
- Oh, hi!

10:00.602 --> 10:02.435
I thought you didn't need anyone
to cover Show Choir.

10:02.537 --> 10:04.637
You said you were good, good, good.

10:04.706 --> 10:06.005
See, I was good

10:06.074 --> 10:08.608
because the thing
I thought I had, I didn't have,

10:08.676 --> 10:10.743
but then the thing
I thought I didn't have...

10:10.812 --> 10:12.645
turns out, I had that thing.

10:12.714 --> 10:14.547
Lainey, what's going on?
Did I do something wrong?

10:14.616 --> 10:16.882
Now that you mention it,
I-I didn't want to bring this up,

10:16.985 --> 10:18.584
but I was getting a vibe from the kids.

10:18.686 --> 10:19.652
It's Ms. Howell!

10:19.721 --> 10:21.053
Look, everybody! Ms. Howell's here!

10:21.122 --> 10:22.588
She sure is!

10:22.690 --> 10:23.633
And Ms. Lewis.

10:23.666 --> 10:24.932
- Please, come in.
- Yeah!

10:25.026 --> 10:26.125
Wait, does this mean

10:26.194 --> 10:27.994
we can finally stop watching CB
do "the worm"?

10:28.062 --> 10:29.095
No offense.

10:29.163 --> 10:30.263
None taken.

10:30.331 --> 10:31.897
Hey, Ms. Howell, we all decided

10:31.933 --> 10:33.844
since you crushed
that 4 Non Blondes song,

10:33.899 --> 10:35.101
you should do it with us in the recital.

10:35.169 --> 10:36.736
- Really?!
- What do you think, Ms. Lewis?

10:36.804 --> 10:38.838
I think...

10:38.940 --> 10:40.773
What choice do I have?

10:40.842 --> 10:44.210
<i>I was gonna have to get used to
having Wilma in Show Choir,</i>

10:44.312 --> 10:47.183
<i>and Coach Mellor realized he
had an intruder in his world.</i>

10:47.253 --> 10:48.519
Get a deep stretch, people!

10:48.566 --> 10:50.199
A tight hamstring
is the devil's delight.

10:50.268 --> 10:51.701
What are you doing here?

10:51.769 --> 10:53.636
Well, I'm Toby's legal guardian,

10:53.705 --> 10:56.238
and as such, I am here
to guard him, legally.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.941
Well, you should know
that legal guardians and parents

10:59.010 --> 11:01.510
are strictly forbidden
from entering the classroom.

11:01.579 --> 11:03.779
Might want to check the school handbook.

11:03.848 --> 11:06.682
It's called the "Beverly
Goldberg Schmoopie-pie" rule.

11:06.751 --> 11:07.917
I see. Well, in that case,

11:07.985 --> 11:10.019
I'm here as Nurse Julie
on official school business.

11:10.088 --> 11:12.254
Oh-ho-ho, you crafty minx.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.789
And the school handbook also states

11:13.858 --> 11:16.592
that the nurse has, quote,
"the authority to approve

11:16.661 --> 11:19.595
any and all activities
following a P.E. injury."

11:19.664 --> 11:21.297
Julie, he's a boy.
He's gonna get banged up.

11:21.399 --> 11:23.232
By the time I was his age,
I'd broken seven bones,

11:23.301 --> 11:24.700
I had to have two fingers reattached,

11:24.769 --> 11:26.836
and I'd taken more shots
to the head than I can remember,

11:26.938 --> 11:28.204
and I'm fine.

11:28.306 --> 11:30.239
And I'd taken more shots
to the head than I can remember,

11:30.341 --> 11:31.307
and I'm fine.

11:31.376 --> 11:33.409
Go ahead and teach your class, Rick.

11:33.478 --> 11:35.778
Just remember that you need
Nurse Julie's approval

11:35.847 --> 11:38.681
each and every time you'd like
Toby to take physical action.

11:38.770 --> 11:39.682
Do I?

11:39.751 --> 11:41.884
In that case, approval shall be sought.

11:43.187 --> 11:45.087
All right! Bleacher runs!

11:45.189 --> 11:47.623
Ready, set, go!

11:47.725 --> 11:48.691
Except for Toby.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.961
Nurse Julie,
may Toby run up the first step?

11:52.063 --> 11:54.222
- Seriously?
- You said I need express permission.

11:54.292 --> 11:56.065
- Fine. Yes.
- Go ahead.

11:57.001 --> 11:58.300
Stop, Toby.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.736
Nurse Julie, may Toby ascend
to the next step?

12:00.805 --> 12:03.139
- Cleared for all steps.
- Thank you.

12:03.207 --> 12:05.598
Nurse Julie, is Toby
medically approved to pull up?

12:05.676 --> 12:07.076
Yes.

12:07.145 --> 12:08.611
Hold tight there, Tobe-ster.

12:08.679 --> 12:10.513
Nurse Julie, permission to pull down?

12:10.581 --> 12:11.981
This is getting ridiculous.

12:12.049 --> 12:13.215
Can I come down now?

12:13.284 --> 12:15.065
Well, you could if it was
up to me, but unfortunately...

12:15.127 --> 12:16.705
Come down, Toby.

12:17.722 --> 12:18.687
Whoa!

12:18.756 --> 12:20.389
Nurse Julie,
can Toby have a sip of water?

12:20.491 --> 12:21.690
Word of warning, he may drown.

12:23.694 --> 12:25.561
Stop being such a jerk, Rick.

12:25.663 --> 12:27.863
You're the one who came here
drunk with nurse power.

12:27.932 --> 12:29.632
Because you ignored my wishes for Toby.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.934
Well, that doesn't mean you have to
treat me like I'm a danger to the boy.

12:32.003 --> 12:33.302
Okay, that's enough.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.603
Ed Morris just came into my office

12:34.705 --> 12:36.505
and said you were having
a lovers' quarrel.

12:36.574 --> 12:39.742
Do you think I enjoy hearing
Ed Morris say "lovers' quarrel"?

12:39.844 --> 12:40.776
I do not.

12:40.845 --> 12:42.344
My office, right now.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.814
<i>Glascott wanted to put an end
to their arguing.</i>

12:44.916 --> 12:46.782
<i>Meanwhile, my first
choir rehearsal with Wilma</i>

12:46.851 --> 12:47.817
<i>was about to start.</i>

12:47.885 --> 12:49.952
Okay, let's go from the pre-chorus.

12:50.021 --> 12:51.921
One, two, three...

12:51.989 --> 12:55.491

Oh, did it?

13:18.182 --> 13:19.882
Oh, my God. Sorry.

13:19.951 --> 13:21.851
I must have hit it by accident.

13:21.953 --> 13:23.085

Oh. Uh, I thought you could keep up.

I'm just trying to jam, man.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.286
Can we please have a creative
meeting in the hallway?

13:57.355 --> 14:00.055
Okay, seriously, what's your problem?

14:00.124 --> 14:02.224
- Singing is supposed to be my thing.
- What?!

14:02.301 --> 14:03.325
You already have science,

14:03.394 --> 14:05.194
but now you had to go
and take my thing, too!

14:05.263 --> 14:07.263
I wasn't trying to take your thing.

14:07.331 --> 14:08.531
You don't own singing.

14:08.633 --> 14:09.732
But I do here.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.834
Until your dumb, beautiful voice
stole my thunder.

14:11.903 --> 14:13.168
So, now you own thunder, too?

14:13.237 --> 14:14.703
I could own thunder. You don't know.

14:14.805 --> 14:16.305
Look, I don't have time for this.

14:16.407 --> 14:18.140
I was just trying to help out a friend,

14:18.209 --> 14:20.676
but if you're gonna act like
a child, I am more than happy

14:20.745 --> 14:23.946
to take my dumb, beautiful voice
and go home.

14:24.015 --> 14:26.315
<i>I had only created
more friction with Wilma.</i>

14:26.384 --> 14:27.683
<i>Meanwhile, Glascott was trying to solve</i>

14:27.785 --> 14:28.918
<i>Mellor and Julie's conflict.</i>

14:28.986 --> 14:30.753
Okay, guys, we gotta figure this out.

14:30.821 --> 14:33.122
I can't have you fighting
in front of the students.

14:33.190 --> 14:34.976
Yeah, no fighting. Julie won't allow it.

14:35.001 --> 14:35.968
Get bent, Rambo.

14:35.993 --> 14:39.039
It's obvious your situation
is made more stressful

14:39.094 --> 14:41.030
because you two play too many roles...

14:41.132 --> 14:42.932
coach, nurse,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.034
aunt, man-dating-aunt,

14:45.136 --> 14:47.829
legal guardian,
man-dating-legal-guardian.

14:47.854 --> 14:48.868
It's a lot.

14:48.893 --> 14:51.407
And like my poster so eloquently states,

14:51.432 --> 14:53.475
"It's hard to wear a lot of hats."

14:53.544 --> 14:55.578
- That says, "Hang in there!"
- Damn it!

14:55.680 --> 14:57.046
That's supposed to be a poster of a man

14:57.114 --> 14:59.281
trying to balance
a bunch of hats on his head.

14:59.383 --> 15:01.417
It was perfect for this situation.

15:01.485 --> 15:02.818
Martha.

15:02.887 --> 15:04.954
Please stop coming into my
office and changing my posters.

15:05.056 --> 15:06.889
I'm sorry. What is your point, John?

15:06.958 --> 15:09.224
What I'm saying is
I wear a lot of hats, too.

15:09.293 --> 15:11.360
Principal, friend, counselor.

15:11.429 --> 15:14.630
And all of my hats would like
to help all of your hats.

15:14.732 --> 15:15.764
Well, as my principal,

15:15.833 --> 15:17.700
can you tell the nurse
to stop treating Toby

15:17.768 --> 15:19.802
like a china doll with bird bones?

15:19.870 --> 15:22.304
And as my friend,
can you tell my boyfriend

15:22.406 --> 15:25.126
to stop trying to turn Toby
into a mini Steven Seagal?

15:25.176 --> 15:27.384
Look, guys, what I'm hearing is that

15:27.439 --> 15:29.578
- you both want what's best for Toby.
- Yes.

15:29.603 --> 15:30.847
- Of course.
- That's what I thought.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.399
- By helping him to prepare...
- By trying to keep him safe...

15:32.469 --> 15:34.183
- ...for all the challenges he'll face in life.
- ...from all the dangers he'll face in life.

15:34.285 --> 15:35.985
You know, I hear arguments
like this all the time.

15:36.087 --> 15:38.087
- When I'm dealing with parents.
- Parents?

15:38.189 --> 15:39.488
Parents with very different opinions

15:39.557 --> 15:41.056
on how a child should be raised.

15:41.158 --> 15:42.758
Well, the P-word
doesn't really apply to me,

15:42.860 --> 15:44.093
since Julie's made it very clear

15:44.195 --> 15:45.494
that she's the parent and I'm not.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.396
Rick, you act like
you're completely shut out.

15:47.498 --> 15:49.565
You're totally involved in Toby's life.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.367
Sure. Driving him around,
making his lunch,

15:51.469 --> 15:52.735
helping him with his homework.

15:52.837 --> 15:54.870
I'm basically a super-jacked nanny,

15:54.972 --> 15:57.406
and it seems to me
that's all I'll ever be.

15:59.410 --> 16:02.444
I'm sorry, Julie.
I don't know what to say.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.079
But maybe that poster does.

16:06.283 --> 16:08.617
Seems Martha knew exactly
what belonged on my wall.

16:09.934 --> 16:11.735
<i>It had been a day
since I snapped on Wilma,</i>

16:11.804 --> 16:13.121
<i>and I needed some alone time.</i>

16:13.184 --> 16:15.740
<i>But CB wasn't gonna let me have it.</i>

16:15.795 --> 16:17.459
- Hi, Lainey.
- Hey.

16:17.553 --> 16:19.388
<i>He could tell something was wrong,</i>

16:19.467 --> 16:20.848
<i>so he tried to cheer me up</i>

16:20.920 --> 16:22.987
<i>by showing off some of
those breakdancing skills</i>

16:23.056 --> 16:24.180
<i>he had been bragging about.</i>

16:24.274 --> 16:27.642
<i>Despite my lack of enthusiasm,
he just kept on trying.</i>

16:29.946 --> 16:31.723
Oh, come on, Lainey.

16:31.748 --> 16:33.308
That was my money move right there.

16:33.356 --> 16:35.690
I'm sorry. I'm just kind of
having the worst day ever.

16:35.759 --> 16:36.925
That's intense. What's wrong?

16:37.027 --> 16:38.660
Wilma's a better singer than me.

16:38.729 --> 16:39.861
That's the worst day ever?

16:39.930 --> 16:41.496
You don't get it.
I'm the one who had a band.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.531
I'm the one who once opened
for Terence Trent D'Arby.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.566
I should be the best.

16:44.634 --> 16:45.967
Look, just 'cause Wilma's a great singer

16:46.036 --> 16:47.669
doesn't make you
any less of a great singer.

16:47.738 --> 16:50.505
I know, but she's so good. It's like...

16:50.574 --> 16:52.273
Okay, seems like you have
two choices right here.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.842
You can either be jealous or petty...

16:53.910 --> 16:55.143
Oh. Well, I guess I'd go with jealous.

16:55.212 --> 16:56.303
No, that wasn't the choice.

16:56.342 --> 16:58.213
- Those were both in the first choice.
- What's the second choice?

16:58.281 --> 16:59.814
You can get over all this stuff,

16:59.850 --> 17:02.684
apologize to Wilma, and continue
with your great friendship.

17:04.087 --> 17:05.854
- Thanks, CB.
- No problem.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.359
Wow. Polishing your whistles.

17:12.462 --> 17:13.962
You must really be mad at me.

17:14.030 --> 17:16.263
Yeah, well,
polishing them does soothe me.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.632
In a way, these whistles are

17:17.701 --> 17:19.367
the only children I'll ever have, so...

17:19.469 --> 17:20.868
Rick, come on.

17:20.936 --> 17:22.837
I don't understand why you're
shutting me out of Toby's life.

17:22.939 --> 17:24.372
I'm not trying to shut you out.

17:24.441 --> 17:26.273
It's just that this
whole parenting thing

17:26.343 --> 17:27.809
is new and overwhelming for me,

17:27.877 --> 17:30.211
and I am constantly scared
that I'm gonna screw it up.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.279
Are you kidding me?

17:31.381 --> 17:33.014
Julie, you're an amazing mom.

17:33.116 --> 17:34.783
Toby is so lucky to have you.

17:34.851 --> 17:35.817
Thank you.

17:35.886 --> 17:37.919
And you don't have to do this alone.

17:38.021 --> 17:40.021
I... just didn't realize
that you wanted to be

17:40.090 --> 17:41.723
such an active part of Toby's life.

17:41.825 --> 17:43.391
Why wouldn't I want that?

17:43.460 --> 17:45.026
I told you, he's my guy.

17:45.095 --> 17:46.561
I just wasn't sure
that that's a commitment

17:46.663 --> 17:47.962
that you wanted to take on.

17:48.064 --> 17:49.030
Well, it is.

17:49.099 --> 17:50.598
It's all part of us.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.667
But I should have
respected your boundaries

17:52.736 --> 17:54.002
and not done what I did.

17:54.104 --> 17:55.270
I know that you were just doing

17:55.372 --> 17:57.505
- what you thought was best for Toby.
- Of course.

17:57.607 --> 17:58.706
That's all I'll ever do,

17:58.775 --> 18:00.975
and I know that's all you'd ever do.

18:01.044 --> 18:03.745
I think we just need to do
a better job of communicating

18:03.847 --> 18:05.413
so we can do it together.

18:06.157 --> 18:07.182
I'd like that.

18:07.284 --> 18:08.384
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

18:08.451 --> 18:10.652
Hey, guys. So, um...

18:10.720 --> 18:13.704
some kids just invited me
to ride ATVs with them.

18:13.774 --> 18:15.256
- Can I go?
- ATVs?

18:15.325 --> 18:17.125
No, those things are very dangerous.

18:17.194 --> 18:18.326
You could...

18:18.395 --> 18:20.228
What do you think, Rick?

18:20.297 --> 18:21.996
Well, Toblerone, that sounds super fun.

18:22.098 --> 18:23.765
But I have an idea that's even more fun

18:23.867 --> 18:25.033
and not nearly as deadly.

18:25.135 --> 18:26.568
Ooh! I like the sounds of that.

18:26.636 --> 18:29.571
<i>Like that, Coach and Julie
had come to an understanding.</i>

18:29.639 --> 18:32.407
<i>But as for me, I still owed
someone an apology.</i>

18:32.509 --> 18:33.441
Hey.

18:33.543 --> 18:35.109
Look.

18:35.212 --> 18:36.978
I'm so sorry. For everything.

18:37.047 --> 18:38.479
That's a start.

18:38.582 --> 18:40.415
The truth is...

18:40.517 --> 18:41.883
I was jealous of you.

18:41.985 --> 18:43.651
That's a gimme. No credit for that.

18:43.753 --> 18:46.221
It's just that being the rock
star is a big part of who I am,

18:46.323 --> 18:47.589
and then when you just swooped in...

18:47.691 --> 18:48.923
Sorry.

18:48.992 --> 18:51.926
When I asked for your help,
which you so kindly provided...

18:51.995 --> 18:53.094
Back on track.

18:53.196 --> 18:55.530
You did it so effortlessly,
and I just felt totally insecure.

18:55.599 --> 18:57.265
I mean, I'm the music teacher.
That's my area.

18:57.334 --> 18:59.133
But I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

18:59.202 --> 19:01.936
Lainey, you have nothing
to feel insecure about.

19:02.005 --> 19:04.672
It took me six years of college
to become a teacher,

19:04.774 --> 19:05.840
and from what I hear,

19:05.942 --> 19:08.042
you just walked in
with barely any training

19:08.111 --> 19:10.511
to be one of the best teachers
here at this school.

19:10.614 --> 19:12.447
Thank you, Wilma.

19:12.515 --> 19:13.882
And I get the jealousy thing.

19:13.950 --> 19:15.483
I mean, I don't know how I'd react

19:15.552 --> 19:19.220
if you came in here and solved
the Quantum Theory of Gravity.

19:19.322 --> 19:20.822
Yeah, I don't think
we have to worry about that.

19:27.063 --> 19:29.597

20:28.779 --> 20:31.056

Now we know this bucket'll fit

20:34.441 --> 20:37.142
I want you to know that you can
push through any boundary.

20:37.244 --> 20:39.163
I think today,
you've proved that you will.

20:43.261 --> 20:45.595
I never really had a dad, Toby.

20:45.697 --> 20:47.364
My old man was always traveling.

20:47.466 --> 20:48.832
I remember one time, he ca...

20:48.934 --> 20:50.166
Toby?

20:50.268 --> 20:51.843
Toby! Toby!

20:51.897 --> 20:53.414
Sorry, Coach.

20:53.468 --> 20:55.359
Don't worry, Coach, I'll catch up.
