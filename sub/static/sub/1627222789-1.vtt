01:56.676 --> 01:58.243
Yeah, no,
everything's fine, Alan.

01:58.276 --> 02:00.179
It's just, um,
I'm kinda having some issues

02:00.213 --> 02:01.346
with the property.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.983
No, no, no,
there's nothing wrong with it,

02:04.016 --> 02:06.284
it's just...
It's kind of a tough sell.

02:06.318 --> 02:08.121
It's not a house...

02:08.888 --> 02:10.889
it's a leasing office.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.493
Yeah, no, I tell
every single person

02:14.526 --> 02:15.594
that if they want
they could tear

02:15.628 --> 02:17.262
the whole place down.
I just...

02:17.295 --> 02:19.999
I don't think everyone has the
same imagination that you do, Alan.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.971
Alan?

02:25.004 --> 02:26.571
Yeah, yeah. Sorry, no I can...
I can hear you,

02:26.605 --> 02:29.976
just, uh, the service out here
is really, really shitty.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.078
Bad. Um...

02:32.111 --> 02:34.346
Yeah, you know what?
Hold on one second, Alan.

02:34.379 --> 02:36.149
Alan, this is my
11:00 o'clock showing,

02:36.182 --> 02:38.851
so I actually gotta take this
really quick, okay?

02:38.885 --> 02:41.120
Yeah, I know. No, I thought...

02:41.154 --> 02:43.622
Yeah, no, I know.
Won't let you down, buddy. All right.

02:43.656 --> 02:45.091
Suck my dick.

02:45.124 --> 02:46.793
Hey, Cynthia, how are you doing?

02:46.826 --> 02:48.094
You finding the place, okay?

02:48.127 --> 02:49.996
I know
we're really deep out here.

02:51.798 --> 02:53.633
No, no, no, no, no...

02:53.666 --> 02:54.934
No need to apologize, Cynthia.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.969
You're good, you're good.
When can I expect you?

02:57.703 --> 02:59.604
Three? Okay.

02:59.639 --> 03:01.007
Yeah, that's no problem at all.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.507
And by the way, Cynthia,

03:02.541 --> 03:05.945
I am looking at one of the
most beautiful...

03:12.819 --> 03:14.486
Fuck this job.

03:54.827 --> 03:56.128
Help!

04:39.404 --> 04:41.207
Stop. Stop.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.407
Stop it!

04:42.440 --> 04:43.943
Stop it.
I'm not gonna do anything, okay!

04:43.976 --> 04:46.045
- It's done. I said stop struggling.
- Stop.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.847
- Stop!
- Stop.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.249
- Stop!
- Hey!

04:53.485 --> 04:55.520
Drop your gun
and step away from her.

04:56.722 --> 04:59.725
I mean it. I will shoot you,
not a second thought.

05:02.494 --> 05:03.595
Do it!

05:13.205 --> 05:16.075
All right, stay right there,
I'm calling the police.

05:18.311 --> 05:19.444
Hey!

05:19.477 --> 05:20.680
Hey, don't move!

05:26.584 --> 05:28.020
Hey, are you okay?

05:28.054 --> 05:29.322
Look, I'm gonna call
the cops right away.

05:29.355 --> 05:30.356
We're gonna get you
an ambulance,

05:30.389 --> 05:31.456
we're gonna get you
some help, okay?

05:31.489 --> 05:33.525
Please don't call the cops.
Please.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.429
Um...

05:36.461 --> 05:38.030
I'm an immigrant.

05:38.064 --> 05:40.299
I'm undocumented.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.001
Okay, um...

05:42.034 --> 05:43.970
Hey, please, please don't
go to sleep, all right?

05:44.003 --> 05:46.072
My name is Alex.
I'm gonna get you some help, okay?

05:46.105 --> 05:47.773
Just stay right here.

05:48.573 --> 05:49.709
Fuck!

05:49.742 --> 05:50.843
Fuck!

05:50.876 --> 05:52.278
Fuck!

06:05.124 --> 06:06.859
Where is all
this blood coming from?

06:06.892 --> 06:08.361
I don't see any wounds on you.

06:08.394 --> 06:11.464
Where are you hurt,
can you tell me?

06:11.496 --> 06:14.700
Are you... Are you damaged internally?

06:15.701 --> 06:17.069
Look... Hey, hey...

06:17.103 --> 06:19.638
If you are hurt internally,
then I need to get you an ambulance,

06:19.672 --> 06:20.873
do you understand?

06:20.906 --> 06:22.908
No... No.

06:22.942 --> 06:24.110
No cops...

06:24.143 --> 06:26.544
- No what?
- No cops... No cops.

06:26.578 --> 06:28.914
Look, it does not matter what you
were doing out there, all right?

06:28.948 --> 06:30.548
If you die, then that's it.

06:30.582 --> 06:33.052
And I'm not going to be able to
sell this fucking property, okay?

06:33.085 --> 06:35.021
And I can't...
I cannot afford that right now.

06:35.054 --> 06:36.621
Not very good timing...

06:36.655 --> 06:38.858
Miss... Hey, hey,
look at me. Look at me.

06:38.891 --> 06:40.126
Look at me, stay with me.

06:40.159 --> 06:41.526
- I need to get you a doctor.
- No.

06:41.559 --> 06:42.795
- Okay, I'm calling you a doctor.
- He drugged me.

06:42.828 --> 06:44.864
- He drugged me.
- Who?

06:44.897 --> 06:46.499
He drugged me.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.867
He drugged me.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.101
Jesus Christ!

06:49.135 --> 06:50.535
Okay, all right.
We're gonna get you some water,

06:50.568 --> 06:52.338
and, um, we're gonna
wash you off.

06:52.371 --> 06:53.839
All right, you're okay.

06:53.873 --> 06:56.742
You're good. We're good.

06:56.776 --> 06:58.477
Fuck, it's Cynthia!

07:00.446 --> 07:01.313
Shit!

07:01.347 --> 07:02.782
Jesus Christ! Okay.

07:02.815 --> 07:04.016
All right, uh...

07:04.050 --> 07:06.685
You're good, you're good,
just get on your back.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.354
There you go.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.456
Of course, this would
fucking happen to me.

07:10.489 --> 07:12.958
Oh, why not you just
please, please, just shh...

07:12.992 --> 07:14.693
Be quiet, please.

07:15.895 --> 07:17.196
Okay, just...

07:17.229 --> 07:18.397
Please be quiet. I'm so sorry.

07:18.431 --> 07:20.565
You're gonna be okay.

07:20.598 --> 07:21.967
Fuck!

07:23.769 --> 07:25.905
Coming!

07:25.938 --> 07:27.605
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

07:28.541 --> 07:29.809
Alex!

07:29.842 --> 07:32.111
Yeah, be right there. I, um...

07:32.144 --> 07:33.746
This is...

07:33.779 --> 07:35.648
...cleaning up a little bit.

07:35.681 --> 07:36.916
Yeah, you know.

07:36.949 --> 07:38.751
But I think this
probably would be the best deal...

07:38.784 --> 07:40.252
Yeah.

07:41.554 --> 07:43.689
- Alex!
- Yeah.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.591
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Alex.

07:46.624 --> 07:48.027
- Hey!
- Sorry about that.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.628
- I'm so happy you guys...
- I finally get to meet you, right?

07:49.662 --> 07:51.230
I know, it's so good to meet you.
How was your drive?

07:51.263 --> 07:52.631
- It was good, it was good.
- It was nice.

07:52.665 --> 07:54.133
This is pretty as the pictures.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.202
This is beautiful, honey.

07:56.235 --> 07:57.870
No, this is...
this is beautiful.

07:57.903 --> 07:59.138
This is really beautiful.

07:59.171 --> 08:01.440
- Okay.
- Alex, you've outdone yourself.

08:01.474 --> 08:03.876
I mean, I just...
I just sell the property, right?

08:03.909 --> 08:05.111
The rest is, uh...

08:05.144 --> 08:06.245
...up to God.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.047
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.482
- This is wonderful...
- What do you think?

08:10.449 --> 08:11.951
This is gonna... this is...

08:11.984 --> 08:12.952
- This is...
- It's nice.

08:12.985 --> 08:13.919
It has a lot of potential.

08:13.953 --> 08:15.054
- It has a nice view.
- Yeah.

08:15.087 --> 08:16.755
Its... It's very
under market value...

08:16.789 --> 08:19.058
- so that also creates a lot of flexibility...
- Okay.

08:19.091 --> 08:20.626
...in terms of, you know,

08:20.659 --> 08:22.027
- like, do whatever you want with the property...
- Okay.

08:22.061 --> 08:23.729
- Yeah, and, uh...
- That might... that might make it work.

08:23.762 --> 08:25.998
- The HOA is very, very flexible around here,
- CYNTHIA: Okay.

08:26.031 --> 08:27.399
so you can...

08:27.433 --> 08:29.001
- What was that?
- Oh, um...

08:29.034 --> 08:30.302
You know, we, we, um...

08:30.336 --> 08:31.770
- we have critters out here right now.
- Critters?

08:31.804 --> 08:33.772
- They're in heat...
- That doesn't sound like a critter.

08:33.806 --> 08:34.907
because it's summertime...

08:34.940 --> 08:36.008
I got bit by one last night.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.143
You did?

08:37.176 --> 08:38.210
I did. Yeah.

08:38.244 --> 08:39.712
Jesus, man,
where'd you get bit?

08:40.078 --> 08:41.679
On my ass.

08:41.714 --> 08:43.649
- Troy, that's... That's TMI.
- Troy.

08:43.682 --> 08:45.217
- I know it's TMI.
- No, it's fine.

08:45.251 --> 08:46.619
- It's totally fine.
- Okay.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.254
- Me and Troy are buds, right?
- This is a friend, Alex...

08:48.287 --> 08:49.989
- It's all right, buddy.
- Let's take a look at the place.

08:50.022 --> 08:51.390
Yeah, you... You know what?

08:51.423 --> 08:52.558
- I actually want to show you guys the view.
- Oh, this is wonderful.

08:52.591 --> 08:53.726
You haven't seen the scenic,
360 degree view yet.

08:55.127 --> 08:56.328
- Yeah, uh, so let's go to take a look...
- What is that?

08:56.362 --> 08:57.196
Is that critters?

08:57.229 --> 08:58.864
No, we have pest control
on the way...

08:58.898 --> 09:00.332
- This is beautiful.
- And they're getting rid of the critters...

09:00.366 --> 09:01.867
- This is beautiful.
- That doesn't sound good.

09:01.901 --> 09:03.469
- That is awesome.
- Critters will be gone by the end of the night.

09:03.502 --> 09:04.638
- That doesn't sound good, Alex.
- Oh, this is beautiful.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.804
Look at this pond, guys.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.641
- No, it's gonna be okay.
- This is wonderful.

09:07.673 --> 09:08.908
Oh, my God!

09:09.842 --> 09:11.377
Honey...

09:12.478 --> 09:14.346
- This is good.
- All right.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.548
What'd I tell you?

09:15.581 --> 09:17.149
- You're right.
- Alex, you told us.

09:17.183 --> 09:19.318
- You did tell us.
- I told you this guy was good.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.920
- Yeah, you did. You did.
- I did.

09:20.953 --> 09:21.987
I'm just here to help, guys.

09:22.021 --> 09:23.122
So, yeah, you know the...

09:23.155 --> 09:24.790
the beautiful thing
about this property,

09:24.823 --> 09:26.759
- in addition to this wonderful view...
- Hm-mm.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.460
...is you can do
whatever you want with it.

09:28.494 --> 09:29.695
- Yeah.
- You can't tear it down.

09:29.728 --> 09:32.431
Rebuild, add on
to what's already here.

09:32.464 --> 09:34.600
The land is so
under market value,

09:34.634 --> 09:35.834
- but...
- Breathe it in, honey.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.069
- Breathe this in.
- I'm breathing.

09:37.102 --> 09:38.003
- I'm breathing.
- Okay.

09:38.037 --> 09:39.271
Uh, no, you can't beat it.

09:39.305 --> 09:40.206
You can't beat the price.

09:40.239 --> 09:41.807
You really can't beat the price.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.210
But in fact, you know,
a fun little piece of trivia, guys, is...

09:44.243 --> 09:46.378
um, if you look out
at the mountain range,

09:46.412 --> 09:48.480
the native Americans used to
say, you could see, um...

09:48.514 --> 09:51.183
a red phoenix
crying tears of sand.

09:51.217 --> 09:53.185
- A red phoenix?
- Yeah, see if you can see it,

09:53.219 --> 09:54.320
you just have to look
really, really hard.

09:54.353 --> 09:55.788
I'm just gonna
fire off an email.

09:55.821 --> 09:57.489
- I'll be right back, guys.
- Honey, I think I can see it right there.

09:57.523 --> 09:58.757
- Yeah, look real hard.
- See on the edge of that...

09:58.791 --> 10:00.226
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

10:00.259 --> 10:01.894
Where am?

10:01.927 --> 10:03.996
No, I need you to lie down so I can
get these people out of here, okay?

10:04.029 --> 10:06.365
Please, god damn it! You are fucking insane!

10:09.636 --> 10:11.103
All right, you're fine.
You're fine, you're fine...

10:11.136 --> 10:13.572
- The horse... See, there's the horse head.
- Yeah, galloping.

10:13.606 --> 10:14.473
Galloping!

10:14.506 --> 10:16.041
Use your imagination,
sweetheart.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.644
I'm fine, I'm fine...

10:20.112 --> 10:22.147
- Got it.
- Hey, guys, I am so sorry,

10:22.181 --> 10:24.817
I, um, I actually have an issue
on another one of my properties,

10:24.850 --> 10:27.386
- so I have to call the party short.
- Oh!

10:27.419 --> 10:29.355
- So sorry, yeah. I, uh...
- Oh, oh, okay...

10:29.388 --> 10:32.057
- Life of real estate, you know, is always...
- All right.

10:32.091 --> 10:34.093
...something going wrong
andvalves going loose...

10:34.126 --> 10:35.894
Can we come back tomorrow
and take a look at the whole place?

10:35.928 --> 10:37.029
- Sure! Sure!
- All right.

10:37.062 --> 10:38.597
Anything you guys need.

10:38.632 --> 10:39.832
- Anything you need, I'll be hanging out...
- Okay.

10:39.865 --> 10:41.600
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Okay.

10:41.635 --> 10:42.935
- Okay, see you tomorrow.
- Of course.

10:42.968 --> 10:44.403
- All right, bye, Alex.
- Yeah. Bye, guys.

10:54.546 --> 10:56.683
Let me help you.

11:15.301 --> 11:17.002
I feel much better.

11:17.036 --> 11:18.037
Thank you.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.072
Good, 'cause I got
a lot of questions for you.

11:26.545 --> 11:28.414
Did you call the police?

11:29.181 --> 11:30.049
No.

11:32.418 --> 11:33.986
Are you going to?

11:36.522 --> 11:38.758
I might. Right now I'm not.

11:45.364 --> 11:46.700
Where am I?

11:47.366 --> 11:48.635
You're in a leasing office

11:48.668 --> 11:50.102
in the middle of
the Sedona desert.

11:51.970 --> 11:53.405
And who are you?

11:53.807 --> 11:55.007
I'm Alex.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.975
I'm a real estate agent.

11:58.678 --> 12:00.979
Listen, I'm...
I'm quite thirsty...

12:01.013 --> 12:04.016
Does that fountain work?

12:04.049 --> 12:05.184
No, nothing works in here,

12:05.217 --> 12:06.952
but I got you some water.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.126
Go on.

12:14.860 --> 12:15.894
It's fine.

12:16.862 --> 12:20.099
Do you happen to have
any unopened ones?

12:20.132 --> 12:21.735
Uh, I just opened it.

12:24.236 --> 12:25.839
Okay, yeah
right over there.

12:27.172 --> 12:28.440
Thank you.

12:45.491 --> 12:47.025
So where are you from?

12:50.864 --> 12:52.164
Africa.

12:52.799 --> 12:54.066
Hm...

12:58.170 --> 12:59.839
Oh, fuck!

13:02.374 --> 13:03.942
I was thirsty.

13:09.181 --> 13:10.482
Thank you.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.918
What for?

13:17.322 --> 13:18.725
For saving me.

13:20.559 --> 13:22.227
He... He was going to kill me.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.164
Yeah, you're welcome.

13:27.499 --> 13:28.868
What's your name,
by the way?

13:30.068 --> 13:31.170
Marakya.

13:35.107 --> 13:36.608
You don't happen to have a...

13:36.643 --> 13:38.210
change of clothing, do you?

13:39.244 --> 13:41.213
I'm, um, a little disgusting.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.015
Uh, yeah.

13:43.048 --> 13:44.183
Yeah, I got you.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.288
Oh! Um, sorry.

13:49.321 --> 13:50.422
It's good, I'm good.

13:50.456 --> 13:51.925
I didn't see anything.

13:52.991 --> 13:55.160
How's the shirt
working out for you?

13:55.194 --> 13:57.697
Yeah, great.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.566
Are you okay?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.135
Yeah.

14:03.168 --> 14:05.204
The guy
who was trying to kill you,

14:06.171 --> 14:07.506
who is he?

14:09.676 --> 14:11.744
He works for
an immigration lawyer.

14:13.412 --> 14:15.180
My immigration lawyer.

14:15.214 --> 14:17.015
And why does he wanna kill you?

14:17.049 --> 14:21.119
Probably because my
immigration lawyer paid him to.

14:21.153 --> 14:24.089
So why does your immigration
lawyer wanna kill you?

14:24.556 --> 14:26.124
He's a lawyer,

14:26.158 --> 14:27.660
but that's just a front...

14:28.594 --> 14:30.062
he's also a sex trafficker.

14:32.564 --> 14:34.734
Is that your car?

14:34.767 --> 14:36.201
Yeah, but...
that's my car,

14:36.235 --> 14:37.202
well... okay...

14:37.236 --> 14:39.037
why does he want you dead?

14:39.071 --> 14:40.305
I know
information about him,

14:40.339 --> 14:41.573
incriminating information.

14:41.607 --> 14:42.775
Like what?

14:43.710 --> 14:44.878
How he
conducts his business,

14:44.911 --> 14:46.679
the people that he works with.

14:47.079 --> 14:48.247
He liked me,

14:48.280 --> 14:50.215
he kept me close.

14:51.283 --> 14:52.551
I'm characteristically close,

14:52.584 --> 14:54.520
closer than the other girls.

14:54.553 --> 14:55.889
Does it have fuel in it?

14:55.922 --> 14:57.256
Yeah, my car has gas in it.

14:57.289 --> 14:58.892
What do you mean,
"other girls"?

15:00.592 --> 15:02.795
He takes advantage...

15:02.829 --> 15:06.431
of vulnerable immigrant girls
who come to the US.

15:06.465 --> 15:09.034
They can't afford
to pay for their visas,

15:09.067 --> 15:10.269
he knows it.

15:12.906 --> 15:15.775
So he gives them alternate ways
to pay him back.

15:19.311 --> 15:20.680
Doing what?

15:22.047 --> 15:24.216
Whatever he wants.

15:24.249 --> 15:26.351
And your immigration lawyer
did that to you?

15:30.924 --> 15:31.691
Yeah.

15:31.724 --> 15:33.125
It's okay.

15:35.527 --> 15:36.896
Among other things.

15:40.198 --> 15:42.635
Which is why we need to get the
fuck out of here and go to LA?

15:42.969 --> 15:44.202
Like now.

15:44.503 --> 15:45.738
Uh...

15:45.972 --> 15:47.105
We?

15:49.474 --> 15:50.542
What... What do you mean?

15:50.576 --> 15:52.411
Uh, Marakya, I'm sorry,

15:52.444 --> 15:53.646
I'm not just gonna
give you my car.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.949
No, I don't want your car,
I just want a ride.

15:55.982 --> 15:58.918
Okay, yeah, I can't just give
you a ride to Los Angeles.

15:59.484 --> 16:00.820
Why not?

16:01.721 --> 16:03.723
Because I...
I don't know you,

16:03.756 --> 16:05.892
and I have meetings,
and work.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.028
Then give it to me.

16:09.796 --> 16:11.530
- Give it to me.
- What?

16:11.563 --> 16:13.432
The gun, the one
he was going to use on me,

16:13.465 --> 16:14.767
give it to me.

16:15.534 --> 16:17.536
No.

16:17.569 --> 16:18.705
What the fuck
do you mean, "no!"

16:18.738 --> 16:20.272
- It's not yours, give it to me.
- No.

16:20.305 --> 16:21.473
No, I'm not giving you the gun,

16:21.506 --> 16:22.842
it's in the trunk of my car.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.610
I'm not giving you a gun.

16:24.644 --> 16:25.712
- Give it to me.
- I...

16:25.745 --> 16:27.747
Stop following me.

16:27.780 --> 16:28.815
- Give it to me.
- Alex: Whoa...

16:28.848 --> 16:30.248
I said, no, okay!

16:30.282 --> 16:31.583
Hey, stop.

16:31.617 --> 16:32.819
He's gonna be back...

16:32.852 --> 16:35.220
as soon as he's able,
probably tomorrow.

16:36.355 --> 16:39.424
Okay, look, I just need
time to think, okay?

16:41.961 --> 16:43.863
Well, if you're not
gonna help me...

16:44.631 --> 16:46.231
just don't...

16:46.264 --> 16:47.834
don't call the cops on me.

16:48.835 --> 16:51.236
Give me a chance
to make a run for it.

16:52.471 --> 16:53.806
Okay?

16:54.206 --> 16:55.273
Okay.

16:55.875 --> 16:57.409
I can agree to that.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.116
<i>Sedona Police.</i>

17:49.162 --> 17:50.429
Oh, shit! Hey.

17:50.462 --> 17:52.531
Hey! Hey, Marakya.

17:52.564 --> 17:53.565
Marakya?

17:53.598 --> 17:54.901
Okay, all right.

17:54.934 --> 17:56.803
I'm gonna get you
to the couch, okay?

17:56.836 --> 17:57.904
- No.
- Jesus Christ.

17:57.937 --> 17:59.237
just hold on to me.
Hold on to me.

17:59.706 --> 18:00.940
Okay.

18:00.973 --> 18:02.507
One, two, three...

18:02.541 --> 18:04.177
You're fine. You're fine.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.012
It's okay.

18:06.045 --> 18:08.815
Okay, just relax here...

18:08.848 --> 18:10.215
Take it easy, you're fine.

18:10.248 --> 18:12.018
I'm sorry. I'm...

18:13.618 --> 18:15.220
Uh...

18:15.822 --> 18:17.890
I think I just passed out.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.093
You were drugged.

18:20.592 --> 18:21.861
I was.

18:21.894 --> 18:24.063
Then why are you trying
to get back to LA?

18:24.563 --> 18:25.998
I have to go back.

18:26.032 --> 18:27.967
I have money hidden in LA.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.069
- This guy tried to have you killed.
- I know.

18:30.103 --> 18:33.371
And your big plan is to go
back to the city where he is?

18:33.405 --> 18:35.041
I have to. I...

18:36.408 --> 18:38.845
I don't have options.

18:38.878 --> 18:41.446
If the police find me,
they'll deport me,

18:41.480 --> 18:43.381
and I won't have anything.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.517
No money, nothing.

18:46.886 --> 18:49.321
At least if I can get
my hands on the cash...

18:50.690 --> 18:52.225
I'll have options.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.426
Okay, look, this is what
I can do for you.

18:54.459 --> 18:56.129
I can give you $100,

18:56.162 --> 18:58.563
and you can just use the money
to get yourself a bus ticket...

18:58.597 --> 19:00.900
They'll find me
at a bus station.

19:08.808 --> 19:10.575
It's fine.

19:10.609 --> 19:11.744
I'll figure it out.

19:11.778 --> 19:13.311
- How are you...?
- I'll figure it out!

19:16.048 --> 19:17.216
Where are you going?

19:20.720 --> 19:22.387
Where are you going?

19:24.322 --> 19:25.925
Marakya, wait.

20:49.407 --> 20:51.409
God, you scared me.

20:51.777 --> 20:53.079
Sorry.

21:03.723 --> 21:05.157
I'm going to take you to LA.

21:07.126 --> 21:09.095
- You will?
- Yeah.

21:09.128 --> 21:10.495
It's an eight-hour drive,

21:10.528 --> 21:12.397
so if we leave now,
I can get back for work tomorrow.

21:14.566 --> 21:15.668
Thank you.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.338
Yeah.

21:21.107 --> 21:22.507
Can I have one more minute?

21:24.576 --> 21:25.610
Sure.

21:26.379 --> 21:27.280
Thanks.

21:31.817 --> 21:33.119
Okay.

21:33.886 --> 21:35.288
Let's get the fuck out of here.

21:42.395 --> 21:43.629
What's this?

21:50.903 --> 21:52.638
Don't thank me.

21:52.672 --> 21:53.940
The serial number's been shaved,

21:53.973 --> 21:56.008
so it's a felony to possess it.

21:57.243 --> 21:59.511
Well, I'm basically
a walking felony,

21:59.544 --> 22:00.746
so what's one more?

22:01.847 --> 22:03.316
About ten years prison time.

22:11.257 --> 22:13.059
Oh, shit!

22:13.092 --> 22:14.226
What?

22:14.794 --> 22:16.362
Cynthia's calling me.

22:16.395 --> 22:18.530
Why are you calling me right now?

22:19.632 --> 22:20.866
Hi, um, Cynthia,

22:20.900 --> 22:22.467
I hope you're not
at the property right now.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.669
Something came up.

22:24.236 --> 22:26.005
<i>Where's Marakya?</i>

22:29.675 --> 22:31.043
Um...

22:31.077 --> 22:33.346
I do not know a Marakya,

22:33.379 --> 22:35.348
but if you're interested
in the property,

22:35.381 --> 22:37.850
I'd be happy to schedule
an appointment with you.

22:37.883 --> 22:40.252
Marakya, if you can hear me,

22:40.286 --> 22:42.088
I want you to know
that he won't stop.

22:43.089 --> 22:44.690
<i>He won't stop
till you're found.</i>

22:44.724 --> 22:46.058
<i>He won't let you go.</i>

22:47.259 --> 22:49.195
<i>Whether it's by me
or somebody else,</i>

22:49.996 --> 22:51.230
<i>if you're going to run,</i>

22:51.263 --> 22:53.632
<i>run, don't stop...</i>

22:54.867 --> 22:56.369
otherwise he'll find you.

22:59.238 --> 23:00.806
Who the fuck is this guy?

23:03.142 --> 23:05.044
His name's Kellin.

23:05.077 --> 23:07.813
He used to be
in the military.

23:07.847 --> 23:09.248
What, working the telephones?

23:09.281 --> 23:11.317
I heard he was a marine,

23:11.350 --> 23:14.086
but he quit or something.

23:15.354 --> 23:16.856
Great!

23:16.889 --> 23:18.024
That's fucking great.

23:18.057 --> 23:19.925
And what does
he want with us?

23:19.959 --> 23:21.526
He's gonna try to...

23:21.927 --> 23:23.362
...kill us.

24:17.783 --> 24:20.352
<i>It doesn't
always happen like you think.</i>

24:23.355 --> 24:24.890
A group of fellow trainees

24:24.924 --> 24:26.859
didn't lock the door
one night,

24:26.892 --> 24:28.894
cover my mouth and rape me?

24:31.063 --> 24:32.565
No.

24:33.532 --> 24:35.801
And it wasn't any of the guys
on my unit,

24:35.835 --> 24:38.304
because they were
all real decent.

24:38.337 --> 24:40.539
And they would have stopped it
if they...

24:43.442 --> 24:45.778
Anyway, no, it was, uh...

24:49.648 --> 24:51.350
It was my lieutenant.

24:54.053 --> 24:55.221
He didn't hurt me or nothing,

24:55.254 --> 24:57.923
he just made it real clear.

24:57.957 --> 25:01.460
When he invited me into his
chambers one night for whiskey,

25:02.328 --> 25:04.296
he made it clear that...

25:06.465 --> 25:08.367
...that I didn't have a choice.

25:10.769 --> 25:11.971
One day during a patrol,

25:12.004 --> 25:15.508
our unit was called
to a location...

25:15.541 --> 25:18.377
two groups of enemy soldiers
descended upon our outposts,

25:18.410 --> 25:20.446
and we were the closest backup.

25:22.014 --> 25:23.215
They were under heavy fire,

25:23.249 --> 25:25.918
so we drove there
as fast as we fucking could.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.390
Only a cop
and a soldier knows that...

25:31.423 --> 25:33.459
that type of adrenaline
that shoots through your veins

25:33.492 --> 25:35.194
on the way to a gunfight.

25:36.896 --> 25:38.597
It's almost thrilling.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.268
Yeah, almost.

25:45.304 --> 25:48.642
We split our forces,
and we tried to flank them.

25:48.674 --> 25:51.710
Me and two other marines moved around
some parked armored ridgebacks,

25:51.744 --> 25:53.946
and on the other side
we saw our enemy.

25:56.115 --> 25:58.184
They had the base overrun.

25:58.217 --> 25:59.852
Most of our guys dead.

26:01.387 --> 26:03.255
You know, a couple of them
had one of ours

26:03.289 --> 26:05.524
and they were dragging him
out to their vehicles.

26:07.293 --> 26:08.827
But they didn't
put him in their car,

26:08.861 --> 26:09.995
they put him on his knees.

26:11.297 --> 26:12.798
They were gonna kill him.

26:14.567 --> 26:17.637
I was the best shot
out of the three so,

26:17.671 --> 26:20.306
I took the MK long scope
that we carried,

26:20.339 --> 26:21.907
and I aimed...

26:25.444 --> 26:27.346
It was dark as hell but, uh...

26:28.714 --> 26:30.382
I know what I saw.

26:31.984 --> 26:33.852
The man they had...

26:36.121 --> 26:37.756
I'll always know him.

26:39.491 --> 26:41.527
It could have been pitch black...

26:42.895 --> 26:44.396
it was him.

26:46.465 --> 26:49.768
The crosshairs on my scope
went to the executioners head.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.875
And then it moved...

26:58.944 --> 27:00.446
...just enough.

27:03.182 --> 27:04.917
I pulled the trigger...

27:06.218 --> 27:07.753
...my bullet missed.

27:10.657 --> 27:11.790
Theirs didn't.

27:17.963 --> 27:20.266
Whether my men really knew
what went down that day or not,

27:20.299 --> 27:21.834
they never told me.

27:23.369 --> 27:25.371
I don't talk
to them anymore.

27:27.206 --> 27:29.408
But, um...

27:29.441 --> 27:32.278
it does feel good
to talk about it so,

27:32.311 --> 27:34.513
thank you for that.

27:36.248 --> 27:37.883
Thank you, Lori.

27:38.951 --> 27:40.619
It took a lot of strength.

27:44.156 --> 27:46.825
I think we all can appreciate...

27:46.859 --> 27:48.827
...the gift of a story,

27:48.861 --> 27:51.130
and how it actually
helps each of us...

27:51.163 --> 27:53.932
get through the challenges
that we deal with every day.

27:55.669 --> 27:59.004
It's not everyone we can actually
reveal these stories to...

28:00.973 --> 28:03.809
...especially when they have no
idea what we've gone through.

28:08.981 --> 28:10.582
Well said.

28:11.350 --> 28:12.851
Thank you.

28:20.292 --> 28:22.027
Hey, Terrance.

28:22.061 --> 28:24.129
I haven't seen you in awhile.

28:24.163 --> 28:26.865
Yeah, yeah, been busy.

28:26.899 --> 28:29.168
- That's good, man.
- Hm-mm.

28:29.201 --> 28:30.502
And it's also important for you

28:30.536 --> 28:32.371
to come to
your meetings regularly.

28:32.404 --> 28:34.106
And share.

28:34.139 --> 28:35.709
I thought
I didn't have to share.

28:36.842 --> 28:38.344
Mm, you don't.

28:38.377 --> 28:40.212
Because you said
I didn't have to.

28:40.245 --> 28:41.313
And you don't.

28:41.347 --> 28:43.182
Hmm, because I don't want to.

28:43.215 --> 28:44.516
You don't have to,

28:44.550 --> 28:46.085
it's not part of
your court order.

28:47.953 --> 28:49.955
Okay.

28:49.988 --> 28:52.391
Anything else, or will you
sign the fucking paper?

28:53.192 --> 28:54.526
Um...

28:55.227 --> 28:56.562
Yeah, I'll sign it.

28:56.595 --> 28:57.930
Thank you.

29:00.466 --> 29:02.000
But I get to ask you a question.

29:03.435 --> 29:04.903
- Do ya?
- Hm-mm.

29:04.937 --> 29:07.172
I don't think I remember
that being part of the deal.

29:07.206 --> 29:08.474
Mm.

29:08.507 --> 29:09.975
Look...

29:10.008 --> 29:12.746
I'm not requiring you
to share at these meetings,

29:12.779 --> 29:15.180
but part of you court order,
which you got for punching...

29:15.214 --> 29:17.650
a parking enforcement officer
in the face, last month,

29:17.684 --> 29:20.319
does require you to participate.

29:20.352 --> 29:22.621
Now I have
very loose requirements

29:22.655 --> 29:23.956
for the term "participate."

29:25.090 --> 29:27.761
If you'd rather I tighten

29:27.794 --> 29:29.629
I'd be more than happy
to oblige.

29:32.297 --> 29:34.433
Or a simple question
will suffice me,

29:35.067 --> 29:36.568
at least this week.

29:41.073 --> 29:42.174
What do you want to know?

29:47.346 --> 29:48.748
Why did you leave the Marines?

29:50.115 --> 29:52.050
You were there eight years,

29:52.084 --> 29:53.485
first class.

29:53.519 --> 29:56.188
Most who stay longer than
twelve months,

29:56.221 --> 29:57.824
usually stay for life.

29:59.458 --> 30:02.594
Hey, be real with me.

30:04.396 --> 30:06.131
It's another stipulation
of my one question.

30:13.673 --> 30:15.007
It was the violence.

30:19.077 --> 30:20.245
I get that.

30:21.815 --> 30:25.417
It's hard to unsee the things
we see out there in the field,

30:25.451 --> 30:27.486
things we had to do.

30:27.519 --> 30:30.088
No, no, it wasn't
what we're doing

30:31.990 --> 30:34.026
I'd do anything they ask

30:34.059 --> 30:36.061
and I didn't have a problem
with what I was doing.

30:36.094 --> 30:37.162
I didn't give a shit.

30:38.263 --> 30:40.098
Then what was it?

30:41.967 --> 30:44.136
Because I didn't know why
we were doing it.

30:45.772 --> 30:47.674
Blow up that building.
Okay, sure.

30:47.707 --> 30:49.676
Fine. I'll prepare
the charges myself.

30:49.709 --> 30:51.176
I just want to know
where it ends,

30:52.745 --> 30:56.014
what these tiny little actions
that were doing,

30:56.048 --> 30:59.218
what they're actually
amounting to, you know.

31:02.655 --> 31:05.123
I get it you know, I signed up,

31:06.124 --> 31:07.660
I get the soldier's life.

31:09.294 --> 31:10.295
It was my choice, but,

31:14.166 --> 31:15.768
if I'm going to fight,

31:17.269 --> 31:18.705
if I'm going to kill,

31:20.940 --> 31:22.608
I just want to know
what it's for.

31:27.246 --> 31:28.614
Good enough?

31:33.318 --> 31:34.620
Good enough.

31:44.596 --> 31:45.865
Gotta go.

31:45.899 --> 31:48.133
I think we should keep
talking about this really...

31:48.166 --> 31:51.570
Hey, you got your one question
and I got to go.

31:51.603 --> 31:53.740
Kellin, what is
more important than this?

31:54.506 --> 31:55.875
Making money.

31:57.576 --> 31:58.878
See you, Terrance.

32:03.348 --> 32:05.150
- Next week.
- Yeah.

32:12.257 --> 32:13.660
Fuck.

32:16.261 --> 32:18.130
- Hey, Dad.
- You got a minute?

32:18.597 --> 32:19.832
Yeah. What's up?

32:19.866 --> 32:24.336
Uh, well those,
those motherfuckers

32:24.369 --> 32:26.773
cock suckers,
did it to me again.

32:26.806 --> 32:29.642
- Hey, are you walking?
- No, no, no, I'm not walking.

32:29.676 --> 32:32.544
<i>I took some pain pills,
I'm feeling fantastic.</i>

32:32.578 --> 32:35.748
But those,
those motherfucking cocksuckers

32:35.782 --> 32:39.117
just fucked me in the ass.

32:39.151 --> 32:42.154
Uh, which cocksuckers are
trying to fuck you in the ass?

32:42.187 --> 32:43.923
The doctors. Who else?

32:44.389 --> 32:45.992
What did they say?

32:46.025 --> 32:50.763
I got to have a a second surgery
on top of the first one.

32:51.263 --> 32:52.397
Okay. What?

32:53.633 --> 32:57.536
Yeah, it's another disc.
It's uh, I don't know,

32:57.569 --> 33:00.539
it's collapsed,
it's disintegrated,

33:00.572 --> 33:02.041
I don't know
what the hell it's doing.

33:02.775 --> 33:05.110
Dad, that is a big deal.

33:05.143 --> 33:07.546
Okay, well, I'm gonna have
to call the doctors.

33:07.579 --> 33:09.281
I will come over this afternoon.

33:09.314 --> 33:11.884
No, you don't have to come over.
I'm just telling you.

33:11.918 --> 33:14.721
None of the dramatic shit.
Okay, Dad? Please.

33:15.354 --> 33:17.589
- Okay.
- Are you sitting?

33:17.623 --> 33:19.058
No, I'm tap dancing.

33:19.759 --> 33:20.994
Yeah, I'm sitting.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.395
I'll be over soon.

33:23.428 --> 33:24.897
Stop worrying. Bye.

33:44.884 --> 33:46.284
<i>...has collapsed,</i>

33:46.318 --> 33:48.186
<i>most likely due to how long
we waited on the surgery.</i>

33:48.220 --> 33:49.989
No, we haven't been
waiting on anything.

33:50.023 --> 33:51.891
We've been trying to come up with
the money to afford the surgery,

33:51.924 --> 33:54.626
since you told us the insurance
doesn't cover it.

33:54.661 --> 33:56.062
<i>I understand this is stressful</i>

33:56.095 --> 33:57.964
<i>and we want to do
everything we can.</i>

33:57.997 --> 33:59.899
How much is this additional
surgery going to cost?

33:59.932 --> 34:02.501
<i>A surgery like this could cost
upward of $25,000.</i>

34:02.534 --> 34:04.202
$25,000?

34:04.971 --> 34:06.773
That is half of
the main surgery.

34:06.806 --> 34:09.042
<i>Your father's back problems
are quite complicated.</i>

34:09.074 --> 34:11.342
<i>His spinal cord
is severely damaged.</i>

34:12.745 --> 34:14.147
<i>He shouldn't be walking.</i>

34:14.179 --> 34:16.716
I know, I know, I tell him this,
but he doesn't listen to me.

34:16.748 --> 34:19.284
<i>Kellin, your father needs
this surgery soon.</i>

34:19.317 --> 34:22.054
<i>I'm worried we're already
nearing the point of no return.</i>

34:22.088 --> 34:24.523
<i>If we wait the nerve damage
will cause his health</i>

34:24.556 --> 34:25.524
<i>overall to decline.</i>

34:25.556 --> 34:27.025
I know. I know this.

34:28.628 --> 34:30.362
I'll take care of it.

34:30.395 --> 34:33.900
Just send me quotes, please.
Detailed ones.

34:34.734 --> 34:36.301
Try to fucking help us out.

34:54.585 --> 34:56.554
What part of Haiti are you from?

34:56.588 --> 34:57.924
Port-au-Prince.

34:57.957 --> 35:01.259
Port-au-Prince.
What's it like there?

35:01.293 --> 35:04.262
Um, very hot, very sunny.

35:06.833 --> 35:08.400
Well, your case looks good.

35:08.433 --> 35:09.969
The problem with these
fucking institutions

35:10.002 --> 35:11.938
is just going to be
the wait time.

35:11.971 --> 35:14.239
Could be six to eight months

35:14.272 --> 35:16.142
before you can legally earn
American dollars.

35:16.175 --> 35:19.244
But I need to send money
home to my family.

35:20.545 --> 35:23.281
I know, I... I get it.

35:23.315 --> 35:24.382
I understand.

35:26.618 --> 35:28.487
This fucking country doesn't
make it easy on you, do they?

35:29.321 --> 35:30.322
No.

35:30.355 --> 35:31.958
These cocksuckers on the right
say "Don't worry.

35:31.991 --> 35:34.127
"Our wall is gonna have
a great big door in it."

35:34.160 --> 35:35.427
And that's fucking fantastic.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.063
The problem is that
once you get through the door,

35:37.096 --> 35:41.000
the fee to get in
can exceed $10,000.

35:41.768 --> 35:42.935
Now who?

35:42.969 --> 35:45.437
I asked you who,
fleeing a third world country

35:45.470 --> 35:47.372
has 10,000 spare dollars.

35:48.207 --> 35:49.541
Nobody?

35:49.574 --> 35:50.877
It's bullshit.

35:50.910 --> 35:54.046
It's absolute American
ass-fuckery at its finest.

35:57.750 --> 36:00.887
Look, you're going to be fine,
honey.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.454
I'm gonna get you through this.

36:06.192 --> 36:07.960
We do have some ways
that we can help our clients

36:07.994 --> 36:11.197
make a few extra dollars
while they wait for their visas.

36:11.230 --> 36:12.364
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:12.397 --> 36:13.833
If that's something you think
you'd be interested in,

36:13.866 --> 36:15.500
I could have Peter speak to you
on the way out?

36:15.534 --> 36:18.336
Oh, yes, please, Mr. Anthony,
I'd do anything.

36:19.705 --> 36:21.107
That's what we like to hear.

36:30.983 --> 36:33.618
Peter, could you just...
Thank you.

36:59.245 --> 37:00.478
Yes.

37:03.481 --> 37:04.583
Hey.

37:05.483 --> 37:07.485
Kellin, is everything okay?

37:08.321 --> 37:09.822
Yeah, yeah, but...

37:09.856 --> 37:11.858
You've got the drop off schedule
from Sue, right?

37:11.891 --> 37:14.227
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.064
I was just wondering if we could
talk about something else.

37:18.965 --> 37:20.299
Something else?

37:20.800 --> 37:22.601
If that's all right.

37:24.637 --> 37:26.973
All right, have a seat.

37:34.546 --> 37:35.915
What's on your mind, Kellin?

37:41.954 --> 37:43.322
When I got arrested,

37:45.390 --> 37:46.458
you had me covered,

37:48.361 --> 37:50.329
helped me with
the legal fees and

37:51.931 --> 37:54.466
let me earn
the way I wanted to.

37:57.569 --> 38:01.473
I told you what I wanted to do
and what I didn't want to do,

38:02.642 --> 38:03.709
and you honored that.

38:05.912 --> 38:07.612
Well, that's not
completely true.

38:09.081 --> 38:10.448
I never asked you
what you wanted to do.

38:10.482 --> 38:12.617
I asked you what
you could and couldn't do,

38:12.652 --> 38:14.153
what you were capable of.

38:15.453 --> 38:16.822
Cause I had heard that

38:16.856 --> 38:20.393
you could be one of the most
deadly men in my employ with a gun.

38:20.425 --> 38:21.694
That your kill count
far exceeded

38:21.727 --> 38:23.696
any of the street thugs
I scrape out of the gutter

38:23.729 --> 38:25.097
whenever I need something done.

38:26.332 --> 38:28.200
I told you
that was just a rumor.

38:30.403 --> 38:32.338
Well, I think the rumor
was a rumor.

38:34.807 --> 38:35.975
I knew you were,

38:36.008 --> 38:38.411
and presumably still are
very capable.

38:40.012 --> 38:41.380
Yes, sir.

38:45.651 --> 38:46.752
So what are you saying, Kellin?

38:49.755 --> 38:52.091
Not only are you capable

38:52.124 --> 38:54.526
of doing what you previously
did not want to do...

39:00.032 --> 39:03.102
but now you're
willing and able

39:03.135 --> 39:06.439
to do whatever may be
asked of you by me?

39:10.376 --> 39:13.279
Yes.
Yes.

39:19.752 --> 39:22.455
But you've almost paid me off
completely by driving.

39:23.990 --> 39:25.758
You need money
for something else?

39:27.793 --> 39:29.829
My schedule's opened up.

39:29.862 --> 39:33.199
I need work to fill it soon.

39:38.738 --> 39:40.239
How interesting.

39:42.074 --> 39:43.376
You see...

39:47.346 --> 39:50.816
something quite tragic
has happened in my life.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.188
Sorry to hear that.

39:58.090 --> 39:59.325
I am too.

40:02.261 --> 40:04.163
Maybe we can solve
each other's problems.

40:10.136 --> 40:12.405
- Come on in.
- You hoo!

40:14.807 --> 40:16.541
Hey, listen, I've been thinking,

40:16.574 --> 40:19.045
and you don't need to make
any big plans here or anything

40:19.078 --> 40:21.847
'cause I've decided,
I'm ready to go.

40:21.881 --> 40:23.416
Hey, shut the fuck up, Dad.

40:23.449 --> 40:25.684
Okay. You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

40:25.718 --> 40:26.786
No.

40:26.819 --> 40:28.054
Well that's a good thing.

40:28.087 --> 40:29.688
You never know
what you're going to catch.

40:29.722 --> 40:31.791
All right, Dad.

40:31.824 --> 40:33.558
All right. I'm sorry.

40:33.591 --> 40:34.794
That's alright.

40:39.465 --> 40:40.533
How are you?

40:41.834 --> 40:43.536
It's a complicated conversation.

40:44.602 --> 40:46.038
- Yeah?
- Mm hmm.

40:46.072 --> 40:47.406
Taking your pain meds or what?

40:47.440 --> 40:49.675
Oh, God. They make me
so damn tired.

40:49.708 --> 40:52.645
I think it's better to just
stay awake with the pain,

40:52.678 --> 40:55.514
spend my last few days
clear-headed.

40:55.548 --> 40:59.118
Dad, enough of the
dramatic shit, okay?

40:59.151 --> 41:01.754
Please. You're not
going anywhere.

41:03.656 --> 41:04.790
What do you mean?

41:06.058 --> 41:07.393
I want to pay for treatment.

41:08.427 --> 41:10.262
Uh, how?

41:10.296 --> 41:12.198
They now start
paying personal drivers

41:12.231 --> 41:13.666
thousands of dollars
every night?

41:14.934 --> 41:17.203
I'll find a way. Okay?

41:17.236 --> 41:19.939
No, I don't want you to do that.

41:19.972 --> 41:22.074
No, Come on.
Even if they fix this,

41:22.108 --> 41:24.076
I don't have
that much time left anyway.

41:24.110 --> 41:25.610
So what's the point?

41:25.644 --> 41:27.746
It's just an extra day,
it'll pay double.

41:28.981 --> 41:31.517
Cut my own arm off.
You know that.

41:32.818 --> 41:34.353
I do know that.

41:35.287 --> 41:37.356
It's a damn good thing
nobody wants it.

41:42.795 --> 41:44.530
Now seriously,

41:44.563 --> 41:46.499
where would you get
that kind of money?

41:48.534 --> 41:54.006
Um, my boss, I told you
about, that lawyer.

41:54.039 --> 41:56.609
- Hmm.
- He's a bad guy.

41:58.410 --> 42:00.379
He's got these
foreign girls around.

42:01.247 --> 42:03.749
They're here illegally.

42:03.782 --> 42:06.919
Yeah, and normally, I just
I just drive for him.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.689
It's appointments,

42:10.723 --> 42:14.627
dinners with his dad's business
partners in hotel rooms.

42:14.660 --> 42:17.863
After, but I just,
I just drive.

42:20.266 --> 42:22.201
That pays what it pays.

42:22.234 --> 42:25.738
But I guess
there's this one girl

42:25.771 --> 42:27.239
who got into some trouble

42:28.807 --> 42:30.309
and he...

42:32.144 --> 42:34.513
he wants me to
drive her to Arizona

42:36.115 --> 42:39.385
and get rid of her.

42:40.953 --> 42:43.689
Get rid of her? Like?

42:43.722 --> 42:46.559
Like make it look like
a heroin overdose.

42:49.562 --> 42:52.331
You are, you are seriously
going to do this?

42:53.532 --> 42:54.867
Yes. Yes.

42:57.269 --> 42:58.604
What's wrong with you,
stop.

42:58.638 --> 43:00.739
- I can't even look at you right now.
- Dad, stop.

43:02.241 --> 43:04.109
- What's wrong with you?
- How dare you do this?

43:04.143 --> 43:05.411
What do you mean,
you're doing this for me?

43:05.444 --> 43:07.213
- You're not doing this for me.
- It's my decision.

43:07.246 --> 43:08.447
And I've made it okay?

43:08.480 --> 43:09.915
- I stand by it.
- No you're not.

43:09.949 --> 43:12.051
I look in those eyes right now
that looks so much like my own

43:12.084 --> 43:14.520
and you're telling me you're going
to do something like this for me?

43:14.553 --> 43:16.322
We have no choice.
We need the money.

43:16.355 --> 43:17.623
What am I going to do?
Just let you die?

43:17.657 --> 43:19.592
- I will not let that happen!
- No!

43:19.625 --> 43:22.261
You may think
you don't have a choice.

43:22.294 --> 43:23.462
We all have choices.

43:23.495 --> 43:25.431
- I've got a choice right now.
- No you don't.

43:25.464 --> 43:27.199
- Yes sir, I do.
- Dad, stop.

43:27.233 --> 43:29.435
Dad, stop! Dad!

43:29.468 --> 43:31.003
Dad!

43:36.475 --> 43:40.512
Seriously, where would you
get that kind of money?

43:43.515 --> 43:44.950
Well, I talked to my boss today.

43:46.218 --> 43:48.187
He's going to lend me
some money.

43:48.220 --> 43:50.690
Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna have to
work it off, of course, but

43:51.457 --> 43:53.025
yeah, he said he's gonna do it.

43:53.058 --> 43:55.361
So, it's good.

43:55.394 --> 43:57.796
He's going to lend you
that much money?

43:57.830 --> 43:59.265
I mean, I know
he's a lawyer, but...

43:59.298 --> 44:01.166
No, no. Yeah. No, he's got
the money to spare.

44:02.935 --> 44:04.671
What do you have to do for it?

44:05.571 --> 44:07.641
- Nothing dangerous?
- No, no, Dad.

44:07.674 --> 44:10.677
I'm just driving
this girl to Arizona

44:10.710 --> 44:12.845
for some house
he set up for her.

44:12.878 --> 44:14.313
Super simple.

44:14.346 --> 44:15.614
Who's the girl?

44:16.148 --> 44:17.816
You know her?

44:17.850 --> 44:19.418
No, no, no I don't.

44:19.451 --> 44:21.787
But I've seen her around
a couple of times,

44:21.820 --> 44:25.557
but guess I'll have six hours
to get to know her, huh?

44:25.591 --> 44:26.992
Uh huh.

44:45.311 --> 44:46.680
Back seat.

44:56.121 --> 44:57.923
Ugh! We just passed another one.

44:57.956 --> 45:00.526
That was an Arby's.
We aren't eating that shit.

45:00.559 --> 45:02.127
Okay, but you've already passed

45:02.161 --> 45:04.363
two McDonald's
and Wendy's as well.

45:04.396 --> 45:06.766
Well, this is better.
Trust me.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.300
I'm starving.

45:08.334 --> 45:09.736
Well, it's better than
being sick,

45:09.769 --> 45:12.739
which is what you would be
if you eat at a fucking Arby's.

45:12.772 --> 45:13.906
Okay?

45:13.939 --> 45:15.474
I wish you had Nando's.

45:15.507 --> 45:19.211
Oh, God! I miss Nando's.

45:19.244 --> 45:20.979
What the hell's that?

45:21.013 --> 45:24.583
It's like our version of KFC,
except we have KFC.

45:24.616 --> 45:28.921
Basically, it's chicken,
but an amazing hot sauce.

45:28.954 --> 45:31.758
Like so good that you can
buy it at the counter.

45:31.791 --> 45:34.460
I've got a giant bottle
of the stuff back at home.

45:36.261 --> 45:37.596
Where's your family?

45:39.131 --> 45:40.399
It was just my mom,

45:42.901 --> 45:44.671
but she died.

45:44.704 --> 45:46.205
The last thing that
she said to me

45:46.238 --> 45:48.842
was to get out of Africa.

45:48.874 --> 45:53.579
And I love my people.
I do. I love my culture.

45:53.612 --> 45:56.081
It's just that it's complicated
over there,

45:56.850 --> 45:57.950
dangerous.

46:01.086 --> 46:02.488
And here it was better?

46:03.989 --> 46:05.190
I don't know.

46:06.291 --> 46:08.862
I had that, the American dream.

46:09.962 --> 46:12.331
We all dream it,

46:12.364 --> 46:16.636
but I thought that
I could actually do it.

46:18.070 --> 46:19.672
Make it a reality.

46:22.608 --> 46:24.943
It's pretty fucking stupid,
right?

46:28.380 --> 46:32.518
Listen, I'm actually
getting pretty hungry.

46:32.551 --> 46:35.120
How far is this
magical burger place?

46:37.089 --> 46:39.625
Yeah, yeah it's the next exit.

46:55.107 --> 46:56.308
Stay in the car.

46:56.341 --> 46:58.243
I need to pee.

46:58.277 --> 46:59.746
Yeah, well just
come right back.

47:10.589 --> 47:12.057
Don't you want to know
what I want?

47:12.926 --> 47:14.493
No. They only have
one thing.

47:14.960 --> 47:16.395
Burgers.

47:16.428 --> 47:18.230
Okay, but
don't give me pickles.

47:19.031 --> 47:20.499
I fucking hate pickles.

47:20.532 --> 47:21.868
Yeah, me too.

47:43.121 --> 47:44.223
It's taken.

47:52.364 --> 47:57.603
<i>And you're listening
to KTKQ 100.3 Breeze.</i>

47:57.637 --> 48:02.007
<i>That was "Our House" by
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young</i>

48:02.040 --> 48:05.277
<i>Graham Nash wrote that song
when living with Joni Mitchell.</i>

48:08.180 --> 48:11.016
<i>Young famously wrote
the lyrics to the song</i>

48:11.049 --> 48:12.117
<i>after seeing photos</i>

48:12.150 --> 48:14.721
<i>of the Kent State Shootings
in Life Magazine.</i>

49:16.315 --> 49:17.917
Fuck!

49:22.521 --> 49:24.623
Fuck!

49:27.292 --> 49:28.493
Fuck!

49:39.072 --> 49:41.273
Okay, okay, okay.

49:41.674 --> 49:43.475
Hey. Hey. Hey.

49:43.508 --> 49:44.677
You okay?

49:44.711 --> 49:47.312
Can you wake up for me?
You're okay.

49:47.346 --> 49:48.815
Wake up.

49:51.116 --> 49:52.652
Oh fuck!

49:55.287 --> 49:56.521
Fuck!

49:56.555 --> 49:57.957
Fuck!

50:01.060 --> 50:03.128
Hey, wake up.

50:03.161 --> 50:04.764
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

50:04.797 --> 50:06.365
Hey. Look at me.

50:06.398 --> 50:07.599
Look at me. Can you hear me?

50:07.634 --> 50:09.368
Hey, hey. Hey Marakya.

50:09.401 --> 50:11.269
Please, please, please.

50:11.303 --> 50:13.405
Please. Can you hear me?

50:13.438 --> 50:15.708
Please. Can you hear me?
Marakya.

50:18.276 --> 50:19.812
Okay. hey.

50:19.846 --> 50:22.715
Oh! Fuck!

50:28.888 --> 50:31.724
Wait. Wait.

50:35.394 --> 50:36.729
Marakya!

50:41.366 --> 50:42.702
Marakya!

50:47.539 --> 50:48.875
Marakya!

50:59.152 --> 51:00.385
Marakya, please.

51:08.961 --> 51:10.096
Marakya?

51:15.001 --> 51:16.169
Marakya.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.308
- Stop. Stop.
- No.

51:23.341 --> 51:24.777
- Get off me!
- Marakya.

51:24.811 --> 51:26.511
- Stop! Listen!
- Get off me!

51:26.545 --> 51:29.314
I swear I'm not did you
or anything. I swear. Stop.

51:40.358 --> 51:41.460
Hey.

51:42.729 --> 51:44.429
Drop the gun and
get away from her.

51:46.666 --> 51:47.900
You're on private property.

51:47.934 --> 51:49.969
I will shoot you,
not a second thought.

51:52.105 --> 51:53.271
Do it.

52:01.446 --> 52:04.751
Stand right there.
I'm calling the police.

52:04.784 --> 52:07.220
Hey. Hey, don't move.

52:13.391 --> 52:15.695
Look, I'm gonna call the cops and
we're gonna get you an ambulance.

52:15.728 --> 52:17.063
We're going to
get you some help.

52:46.659 --> 52:49.327
- Kellin.
- You're Anthony's guy?

52:50.263 --> 52:51.329
Call me Johnathan.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.637
Needle, thread, antiseptic.

52:57.670 --> 52:58.971
Get yourself patched up.

52:59.005 --> 53:00.472
Take me to where you lost her.

53:01.941 --> 53:03.176
Actually, I'll follow you.

53:03.209 --> 53:04.844
I don't need you bleeding
on the leather.

53:12.985 --> 53:14.319
Cynthia, what're we gonna do?

53:14.352 --> 53:17.322
Okay, you worried about, Alex.
I say we get out of here.

53:17.355 --> 53:18.991
- This does not look safe.
- We have to stay. We have to wait.

53:19.025 --> 53:20.525
This does not look safe to me.

53:25.097 --> 53:28.234
Hey, are you guys here
to see the property?

53:30.236 --> 53:31.938
Yes, ma'am, We're here
to view the house.

53:31.971 --> 53:33.806
- Is Alex not in?
- No, no.

53:33.840 --> 53:35.574
And I have been trying to get
ahold of him

53:35.607 --> 53:36.809
for quite some time now.

53:36.843 --> 53:39.879
And I'm getting worried
because Troy found this.

53:44.449 --> 53:46.052
Why don't we go inside
and wait for Alex?

53:46.085 --> 53:47.119
I have his number.
We'll call him.

53:47.153 --> 53:48.287
You have his number. Oh, my God.

53:48.321 --> 53:49.789
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

53:49.822 --> 53:50.923
Thank you, sir.

53:50.957 --> 53:52.191
Tro...

53:53.693 --> 53:54.961
Come on.

54:07.940 --> 54:09.141
<i>Hi. Um, Cynthia,</i>

54:09.175 --> 54:10.542
<i>I hope you're not at
the property right now.</i>

54:10.575 --> 54:11.610
<i>Something came up.</i>

54:11.644 --> 54:12.645
Where's Marakya?

54:14.747 --> 54:16.481
Where is Marakya?

54:16.514 --> 54:18.985
<i>I do not know a Marakya, but...</i>

54:19.018 --> 54:21.220
Marakya, if you can hear me,

54:21.254 --> 54:22.955
I want you to know
that he won't stop,

54:23.521 --> 54:25.191
won't let you go.

54:25.224 --> 54:27.226
Not until you're found, okay?

54:27.960 --> 54:29.228
Whether it's by me

54:30.595 --> 54:32.098
or by somebody else,

54:33.666 --> 54:35.567
if you're going to run,

54:35.600 --> 54:37.937
run, don't stop.

54:39.537 --> 54:41.007
Otherwise they'll find you.

54:50.182 --> 54:51.250
Outside.

54:55.087 --> 54:56.454
We'll be right back.

55:01.426 --> 55:02.594
She's gone.

55:03.963 --> 55:05.698
Well, I got the realtor's
business card.

55:05.731 --> 55:07.033
We'll go by his house.

55:08.668 --> 55:10.136
And them?

55:10.169 --> 55:11.671
I'll take care of them.

55:13.339 --> 55:14.774
Come on.

55:14.807 --> 55:16.508
Come on, what?

55:16.541 --> 55:17.777
That's not necessary.

55:17.810 --> 55:21.047
They found her shirt covered
in what I assume is your blood.

55:22.949 --> 55:24.884
Look kid, I don't work for you.

55:24.917 --> 55:26.152
You fucked up

55:26.185 --> 55:27.820
in there we got a problem.

55:27.853 --> 55:30.022
You get in my way,
we got two problems.

55:35.593 --> 55:37.730
And I'm not having
this conversation again

55:37.763 --> 55:39.031
when we find the girl.

55:50.042 --> 55:51.711
Well, folks, we're going to
get out of your hair.

55:53.079 --> 55:55.114
No wait, wait, wait!

55:55.147 --> 55:57.515
No, no, no!

56:01.486 --> 56:03.689
So where do we go now?
Do we go back to my place.

56:03.723 --> 56:05.424
We can't. They'll track us.

56:05.458 --> 56:07.159
Your name is all over
that leasing office.

56:07.193 --> 56:09.161
Right, because I'm
trying to sell it.

56:09.195 --> 56:11.297
Look, they're going to
go to your house,

56:11.330 --> 56:13.165
and then they're gonna
go to your families.

56:13.598 --> 56:15.001
Whoa, what?

56:15.034 --> 56:16.836
What do you mean, my families?

56:16.869 --> 56:18.204
It's what they do.

56:19.405 --> 56:22.842
- What, who are you calling?
- My mom.

56:22.875 --> 56:25.077
<i>Hi, this is Carolina.
I'm sorry I missed you.</i>

56:25.111 --> 56:26.245
<i>I'll get right back to you.</i>

56:26.278 --> 56:27.480
Hey, Mom. It's Alex.

56:27.512 --> 56:28.914
Um, I'm coming to your house
right now.

56:28.948 --> 56:30.383
I just need you to
meet me there. Okay?

56:30.416 --> 56:32.617
Alright. Love you. Call me
when you get the message.

56:32.651 --> 56:33.786
Bye.

56:36.222 --> 56:37.990
All right. New plan. We're going
to my mom's house

56:38.024 --> 56:39.425
and I'm going to take her
to a hotel.

56:40.026 --> 56:41.360
What about me?

56:42.328 --> 56:43.963
You can just take my car.

56:43.996 --> 56:45.097
Okay?

56:45.131 --> 56:46.298
Just take my car,

56:46.332 --> 56:48.934
and then I'll report it stolen
in ten hours.

56:48.968 --> 56:50.870
And you have exactly
that amount of time

56:50.903 --> 56:52.705
to get your money
and then get out of LA

56:52.738 --> 56:55.374
and that's it. Alright?
That's all I can do for you.

56:58.744 --> 57:00.112
I'm sorry.

57:01.313 --> 57:03.182
I didn't want for
any of this to happen.

57:08.354 --> 57:10.856
Absolutely not.
Are you crazy?

57:10.890 --> 57:12.792
Why not, Mom? It'll be fun.

57:12.825 --> 57:15.127
I'm sorry, honey. It's Tuesday.
In the middle of the week.

57:15.161 --> 57:16.796
I'm not going to
some hotel with you.

57:16.829 --> 57:18.230
It would be like a Mom-son date.

57:18.264 --> 57:20.132
You know, we could have some
strong cocktails by the pool.

57:20.766 --> 57:22.068
Are you high?

57:22.101 --> 57:24.136
We could do that too.
Whatever you want.

57:24.170 --> 57:25.704
Don't you have work?

57:25.738 --> 57:28.808
Um, no, I had an issue at
the property come up.

57:31.811 --> 57:33.546
And you? What's your deal?

57:34.246 --> 57:35.613
Are you hungry?

57:39.351 --> 57:40.953
Actually. Yeah, I am.

57:40.986 --> 57:42.655
Why don't I make you
something to eat?

57:42.688 --> 57:43.689
Thank you.

57:43.722 --> 57:45.590
Um, can I ask a question?

57:47.493 --> 57:50.296
- Who is he?
- It's my dad.

57:50.329 --> 57:52.398
It's Thomas.
He passed away a few years ago.

57:53.999 --> 57:55.267
I'm sorry.

57:56.802 --> 57:59.738
He... He's in, in your...

57:59.772 --> 58:01.173
What're you trying to say?

58:02.041 --> 58:04.176
Alex, don't be a dick.

58:04.210 --> 58:05.511
Thomas and I are both Cuban.

58:05.544 --> 58:07.346
We adopted Alex
when he was a baby.

58:09.148 --> 58:10.649
You adopted?

58:10.683 --> 58:11.851
Why would you do that?

58:12.685 --> 58:14.153
Why not?

58:14.186 --> 58:15.654
Didn't you want to have

58:15.688 --> 58:16.922
a kid of your own?

58:19.191 --> 58:20.259
Couldn't you?

58:21.660 --> 58:22.928
You don't mince words.

58:22.962 --> 58:23.896
I like that.

58:25.030 --> 58:26.799
Adoption wasn't
our first choice,

58:26.832 --> 58:27.967
but looking back on it now,

58:28.000 --> 58:29.568
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

58:31.003 --> 58:32.638
I...

58:32.671 --> 58:35.207
I never... I never
thought of it like that.

58:37.243 --> 58:39.345
Hey, honey, I got lots
of food in the fridge.

58:39.378 --> 58:40.646
Why don't you go help yourself?

58:41.380 --> 58:42.781
Thank you. I will.

58:43.816 --> 58:45.417
Alex, why don't we go talk.

58:55.661 --> 58:56.962
All right.

58:56.996 --> 58:58.330
What's really going on here?

59:02.201 --> 59:04.837
Marakya is just
in a little bit of some trouble

59:05.471 --> 59:06.739
with her immigration lawyer.

59:06.772 --> 59:09.308
He just screwed her over
and it's really complicated.

59:09.341 --> 59:12.244
So she asked for a ride to LA

59:12.278 --> 59:13.445
and I was gonna drive her there,

59:13.479 --> 59:14.813
but now she's just
gonna borrow my car.

59:16.682 --> 59:18.450
And why are you
helping this girl?

59:20.553 --> 59:22.621
I don't know.
I just knew I needed to.

59:25.558 --> 59:27.259
That's something
your father would say.

59:31.030 --> 59:32.364
Things aren't easy for her.

59:33.332 --> 59:34.967
She trusted the wrong people,
and...

59:37.803 --> 59:39.171
when I look at her,
it makes me realize

59:39.205 --> 59:42.107
how lucky I am that
you and Dad took me in.

59:42.141 --> 59:43.776
That I even got to grow up
in this country.

59:47.546 --> 59:48.847
Helping her
is the right thing to do.

59:52.718 --> 59:54.654
You really do sound
like your father.

01:00:01.293 --> 01:00:02.528
Look, Mom,

01:00:03.495 --> 01:00:04.997
I need you to do
something for me.

01:00:05.831 --> 01:00:06.966
I don't ask you for much,

01:00:06.999 --> 01:00:10.202
but I need you to go stay
in a hotel and not ask me why.

01:00:10.236 --> 01:00:11.437
Can you please do that for me?

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:12.771
- Alex...
- Mom, please.

01:00:12.805 --> 01:00:14.373
I'll explain
everything to you later.

01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:16.408
I just need you to do
this one thing for me.

01:00:21.213 --> 01:00:22.348
Please.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.022
Yes, honey, I can do this.

01:00:47.973 --> 01:00:49.041
You look nice.

01:00:51.043 --> 01:00:53.012
Yeah, nice change of pace.

01:00:53.045 --> 01:00:54.079
Your mom's a lifesaver.

01:00:55.781 --> 01:00:56.716
Where is she?

01:00:57.816 --> 01:00:58.917
Uh, she's gone.

01:01:01.253 --> 01:01:02.321
And you?

01:01:03.522 --> 01:01:04.724
I'm gonna take you to LA.

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:09.928
Really?

01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:12.666
Yeah, just gonna grab some
stuff and then we can go.

01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:18.904
Okay, I'll be here.

01:02:04.784 --> 01:02:06.452
Miss you more
and more every day.

01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:19.799
All right. I have everything packed.
We should take off soon.

01:02:23.235 --> 01:02:24.470
Hi, there.

01:02:25.672 --> 01:02:26.572
Shit.

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:31.176
This is a moment
I've always come to appreciate.

01:02:32.111 --> 01:02:33.078
Change.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.815
Faith's unyielding forebearer.

01:02:35.849 --> 01:02:37.916
Get on your knees.
You're a tall fucker.

01:03:07.613 --> 01:03:08.748
Why did you do that?

01:03:09.749 --> 01:03:11.216
I'll let you know
when I figure that out.

01:03:16.388 --> 01:03:17.857
Stop.

01:03:17.891 --> 01:03:18.858
Drop your gun.

01:03:18.892 --> 01:03:19.793
I just saved you.

01:03:21.427 --> 01:03:23.529
We don't trust you.

01:03:23.562 --> 01:03:26.064
I think saving your life's a
good enough reason to.

01:03:26.098 --> 01:03:27.801
I'm not
inclined to that thinking.

01:03:28.233 --> 01:03:30.068
Drop your gun.

01:03:33.005 --> 01:03:33.939
Drop your gun.

01:03:49.488 --> 01:03:50.622
You're okay.

01:03:50.657 --> 01:03:52.424
You're okay. Just breathe.

01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:53.693
Just breathe.

01:03:56.763 --> 01:03:58.997
I've never seen anything
like that before.

01:03:59.031 --> 01:04:00.332
Not many people have.

01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:02.034
It's okay. Just breathe.

01:04:03.368 --> 01:04:05.404
I need you to do
something for me. Okay?

01:04:05.437 --> 01:04:07.272
Okay. I need you
to grab the gun.

01:04:07.306 --> 01:04:08.875
All right?
Can you do that for me?

01:04:09.943 --> 01:04:10.877
Here we go.

01:04:13.078 --> 01:04:14.279
Okay, that's good.

01:04:14.313 --> 01:04:16.248
That's great.
That's great, Alex.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.689
What do we do with him?

01:04:29.194 --> 01:04:32.998
Mom, I need you to
take a deep breath for me, okay?

01:04:33.031 --> 01:04:35.635
I'm good. I'm fine.
Everything is fine.

01:04:35.668 --> 01:04:36.669
Everything is okay.

01:04:36.703 --> 01:04:38.437
I just I need you to promise me

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:40.539
that you're not gonna
talk to anyone, okay?

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.308
No, no, no, no, no.
Especially the police.

01:04:43.342 --> 01:04:45.812
Do not talk to the police.
Just get yourself a lawyer

01:04:45.845 --> 01:04:47.814
and lay low for 48 hours.

01:04:47.847 --> 01:04:49.615
I'm clearing all this up.

01:04:51.083 --> 01:04:52.652
Yes, I promise.

01:04:52.685 --> 01:04:53.686
I promise. I'm okay.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.320
I have to go now, Mom,
I love you.

01:04:56.555 --> 01:04:57.623
I know.

01:04:57.657 --> 01:04:59.659
I will be safe.
I love you, Mom. Bye.

01:05:07.967 --> 01:05:08.835
Is that yours?

01:05:11.236 --> 01:05:12.639
No. It's his.

01:05:17.609 --> 01:05:20.145
Fuck, dude. Dude, I know
this number. It's Anthony.

01:05:21.714 --> 01:05:23.048
What do we do?

01:05:25.985 --> 01:05:28.554
I mean if we
take the tape off of his mouth

01:05:28.587 --> 01:05:29.923
then maybe he can help us.

01:05:33.392 --> 01:05:35.160
Kellin, I need a fucking update.

01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:37.997
Kellin is dead.

01:05:42.835 --> 01:05:43.770
Marakya?

01:05:44.904 --> 01:05:46.338
And so is the other
one you sent.

01:05:46.371 --> 01:05:48.975
And so will every other person
that you send, I will kill them.

01:05:51.443 --> 01:05:54.047
All this, this
could end right now.

01:05:54.981 --> 01:05:57.817
Look, Anthony, I'm going away.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.585
You're never
gonna see me again.

01:05:59.618 --> 01:06:01.020
You're never gonna
hear from me again.

01:06:02.922 --> 01:06:05.090
And I won't tell anyone
what you did...

01:06:06.458 --> 01:06:07.660
What you did to me.

01:06:09.494 --> 01:06:13.633
Okay. Just please, please.
This needs to... This needs to end here.

01:06:13.666 --> 01:06:15.935
Just... Okay?

01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:21.741
Anthony... Anthony?

01:06:30.616 --> 01:06:32.018
Is he gonna send someone else?

01:06:34.419 --> 01:06:35.287
I don't know.

01:06:36.421 --> 01:06:37.356
He might?

01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:41.226
He might.

01:06:44.496 --> 01:06:45.832
Is he gonna send someone else?

01:06:48.868 --> 01:06:51.070
He'll send every last
person at his disposal.

01:06:51.904 --> 01:06:53.538
She compromises his business.

01:06:53.572 --> 01:06:55.207
A business that
is very lucrative.

01:06:55.908 --> 01:06:57.209
The sex trafficking business.

01:06:57.242 --> 01:07:02.314
Yeah. It's the most evil,
vile, despicable profession

01:07:02.347 --> 01:07:04.017
that you can have.

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:06.351
Other than being a lawyer
and he happens to be both.

01:07:07.219 --> 01:07:09.221
Fuck you!

01:07:09.254 --> 01:07:11.791
You don't have a right
to change your position on this.

01:07:11.824 --> 01:07:12.992
You drove us.

01:07:13.026 --> 01:07:15.094
You are as much
responsible as anyone else.

01:07:15.128 --> 01:07:18.998
Hey, I didn't have
it easy, either. Okay?

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:22.401
Anthony was my lawyer.

01:07:23.468 --> 01:07:24.469
I got into some trouble.

01:07:24.503 --> 01:07:28.173
I punched this
asshole parking guy.

01:07:31.243 --> 01:07:34.647
Anthony was the only one who would take
the case of a guy with no money so.

01:07:34.681 --> 01:07:35.882
As long as you
kept working for him?

01:07:35.915 --> 01:07:37.817
Yeah. My dad got sick
and I needed the money.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:39.952
What the fuck else
was I supposed to do?

01:07:39.986 --> 01:07:42.354
There's an entire
sex trafficking operation

01:07:42.387 --> 01:07:43.723
happening in Los Angeles.

01:07:44.423 --> 01:07:45.658
Why is no one doing anything?

01:07:45.692 --> 01:07:49.162
I mean the cops tried
but these guys are smart.

01:07:50.763 --> 01:07:52.264
Especially with their
knowledge of the law.

01:07:53.398 --> 01:07:54.466
Cynthia and Troy...

01:07:56.135 --> 01:07:58.236
My clients back at the leasing
office, are they okay?

01:07:58.270 --> 01:07:59.872
No, he killed them.

01:08:00.673 --> 01:08:02.574
Oh, my god.

01:08:02.607 --> 01:08:04.677
Marakya, we need
to call the police.

01:08:04.711 --> 01:08:06.946
- This is insane.
- No. No. We...

01:08:06.979 --> 01:08:08.547
We can't call the police.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.916
You know that
that is not an option.

01:08:09.949 --> 01:08:11.784
It has never been an option.

01:08:11.818 --> 01:08:13.019
Then what are you gonna do?

01:08:13.886 --> 01:08:15.253
Whatever I have to.

01:08:15.287 --> 01:08:16.823
What does that mean?

01:08:18.991 --> 01:08:20.358
What does she mean?

01:08:23.228 --> 01:08:25.397
I can't help you
with that, Marakya.

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:26.765
I am a real estate agent.

01:08:26.799 --> 01:08:28.167
I know, I know.

01:08:31.037 --> 01:08:33.773
But it... It has to happen.

01:08:37.375 --> 01:08:38.343
I'll make it happen.

01:08:42.915 --> 01:08:44.884
What did he do to you?

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:46.652
This is not because you know
about his business.

01:08:46.685 --> 01:08:48.054
This is something personal.

01:08:50.823 --> 01:08:52.692
What did he do to her?

01:08:52.725 --> 01:08:54.227
It's not my business
to tell you.

01:09:00.564 --> 01:09:04.036
Listen, Marakya,

01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:06.738
you cannot pull this off.

01:09:06.773 --> 01:09:07.939
This is suicide.

01:09:07.974 --> 01:09:10.810
- You have one pistol.
- I have three pistols

01:09:16.682 --> 01:09:17.884
Great.

01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:23.354
Look...

01:09:23.388 --> 01:09:25.925
Anthony talked about a...

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.627
a gun maker, he lives
somewhere in the desert

01:09:29.662 --> 01:09:31.029
on the road to Arizona,

01:09:31.063 --> 01:09:33.064
his name's Ken, I think.

01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:36.202
Do you know this man?

01:09:37.203 --> 01:09:39.238
Actually, yeah, I do.

01:09:40.706 --> 01:09:42.241
Anthony needs to be stopped.

01:09:43.676 --> 01:09:46.245
He needs to be
stopped permanently.

01:09:48.714 --> 01:09:50.049
I'm not gonna help you kill him.

01:09:50.716 --> 01:09:52.350
You don't even have a plan.

01:09:52.384 --> 01:09:53.286
I do have a plan.

01:09:54.386 --> 01:09:55.353
I'm gonna go to his house

01:09:55.387 --> 01:09:56.989
and I'm gonna shoot him
in the fucking head.

01:09:57.023 --> 01:09:59.125
You don't have a good plan.

01:09:59.158 --> 01:10:01.493
Well, then, I'll go
to his ranch in the mountains,

01:10:01.526 --> 01:10:03.562
I'll unearth the gold
under the floorboards,

01:10:03.595 --> 01:10:04.730
and I'll fuck off to Mexico.

01:10:04.764 --> 01:10:06.364
Live like a queen
for the rest of my life.

01:10:06.398 --> 01:10:09.202
Marakya, you'll be lucky
if there are one to two people

01:10:09.235 --> 01:10:10.903
besides Anthony
at his house in LA.

01:10:10.937 --> 01:10:13.538
Okay? At his ranch,
there'll be half a dozen.

01:10:15.174 --> 01:10:16.541
So no chance at the ranch.

01:10:19.011 --> 01:10:20.713
You were joking
about the gold part, right?

01:10:20.746 --> 01:10:24.583
No, no, no. Sadly she's not.

01:10:24.616 --> 01:10:27.086
Fucking Anthony makes more
money than he can launder.

01:10:27.119 --> 01:10:29.487
So the rest he carries
in bricks of gold

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:30.589
that he buries at his ranch.

01:10:31.791 --> 01:10:34.026
Well, they're
not exactly bricks.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.730
They're more like
small bars if anything.

01:10:37.763 --> 01:10:39.198
And how would you know that?

01:10:39.866 --> 01:10:40.867
I've seen them.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.101
He showed me.

01:10:43.269 --> 01:10:45.604
Well, it's no wonder
that he wants you dead.

01:10:47.773 --> 01:10:48.641
Look...

01:10:50.142 --> 01:10:51.978
His house is still
going to be guarded.

01:10:52.011 --> 01:10:53.445
Okay? You'll want a better gun.

01:10:57.515 --> 01:10:58.583
Are you gonna help me?

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.420
I won't help you kill him.

01:11:06.158 --> 01:11:07.525
But I will call Ken.

01:11:16.068 --> 01:11:17.670
Hey, uh-uh, don't touch those.

01:11:25.711 --> 01:11:26.646
Are all these guns?

01:11:27.847 --> 01:11:29.015
Yes, they are.

01:11:30.548 --> 01:11:32.218
Surprise bangers.

01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:34.987
They're all the rage nowadays

01:11:35.021 --> 01:11:37.189
in our particular market.

01:11:38.357 --> 01:11:40.026
How do you even fire this one?

01:11:40.059 --> 01:11:42.161
Each one has a hidden trigger,

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.563
just gotta know where to look.

01:11:47.599 --> 01:11:49.402
But...

01:11:54.472 --> 01:11:57.410
I am assuming you are
not here for surprise bangers.

01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:02.048
What exactly were you hoping
I could help you with?

01:12:03.282 --> 01:12:05.550
Well, Ken,
Marakya here is going hunting.

01:12:07.585 --> 01:12:08.453
Is that so?

01:12:09.789 --> 01:12:10.690
It is.

01:12:12.124 --> 01:12:13.726
And I presume
she is going to want

01:12:13.759 --> 01:12:15.661
some artillery for said hunt.

01:12:16.561 --> 01:12:17.562
She will.

01:12:17.595 --> 01:12:19.597
Mm-hm. And the game?
What are we talking about?

01:12:19.632 --> 01:12:21.033
Foxes, bucks?

01:12:21.067 --> 01:12:24.003
A bear surrounded
by mountain lions.

01:12:25.537 --> 01:12:26.872
How many mountain lions?

01:12:26.906 --> 01:12:29.241
Hmm.
At least two, maybe more.

01:12:30.443 --> 01:12:31.978
Goodness.

01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:35.480
Well, that is a hunt where you're
gonna want to be surrounded by a pack.

01:12:36.148 --> 01:12:37.549
That's what I said.

01:12:38.417 --> 01:12:40.953
Unfortunately,
for the huntress,

01:12:40.987 --> 01:12:42.755
this will be an endeavor
undertaken alone.

01:12:45.024 --> 01:12:46.125
I see.

01:12:47.793 --> 01:12:49.095
Well, in that case,

01:12:49.128 --> 01:12:51.330
that leaves us
with only one option.

01:13:01.907 --> 01:13:03.508
This little beauty here

01:13:04.944 --> 01:13:08.347
is my custom
heavy assault rifle.

01:13:08.381 --> 01:13:11.317
I've designed the casing
to absorb the kickback,

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:15.888
making it usable for any man,
woman, person of any size.

01:13:15.921 --> 01:13:17.156
How progressive of you.

01:13:23.095 --> 01:13:24.330
It ain't cheap, though.

01:13:26.866 --> 01:13:29.435
I've got a, um,
a bag of Rolexes.

01:13:30.136 --> 01:13:32.570
Three. Each worth about $2000.

01:13:33.472 --> 01:13:35.808
Do you? You got
a bag of Rolexes?

01:13:36.742 --> 01:13:39.178
Well, that's a start, I guess.

01:13:41.514 --> 01:13:42.448
We've got a car.

01:13:44.984 --> 01:13:46.584
Yeah, unfortunately,
I know the guy

01:13:46.618 --> 01:13:49.554
who owns that
particular vehicle.

01:13:49.922 --> 01:13:50.790
Owned.

01:13:55.861 --> 01:13:57.196
Owned.

01:13:58.431 --> 01:14:00.332
Oh, well, now
that is interesting.

01:14:03.568 --> 01:14:05.404
The guy was a bit
of a prick anyway.

01:14:07.572 --> 01:14:09.475
All right.
I guess we got a deal.

01:14:09.508 --> 01:14:11.844
I have a garage in Los Angeles

01:14:11.877 --> 01:14:13.345
where you can drop it off at.

01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:14.612
Great.

01:14:15.815 --> 01:14:16.682
Yeah.

01:14:19.118 --> 01:14:20.286
Okay.

01:14:21.987 --> 01:14:23.122
Come with me.

01:14:23.989 --> 01:14:25.291
I'm going to show you
how to use it.

01:14:33.132 --> 01:14:34.333
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

01:14:34.934 --> 01:14:36.335
<i>You're gonna help her?</i>

01:14:36.368 --> 01:14:37.636
<i>I said
I would bring her here.</i>

01:14:38.471 --> 01:14:39.805
<i>After that, she's on her own.</i>

01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:43.209
<i>What did he do to her?</i>

01:15:15.374 --> 01:15:16.609
You can talk to me

01:15:18.043 --> 01:15:18.911
if you want.

01:15:33.893 --> 01:15:36.462
Listen, I'm here.

01:15:58.584 --> 01:16:02.254
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

01:16:15.134 --> 01:16:16.535
Did Sue tell you?

01:16:17.203 --> 01:16:18.404
She did.

01:16:20.706 --> 01:16:21.574
Are you mad?

01:16:23.876 --> 01:16:24.843
Do I look mad?

01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:28.881
No, I'm not mad.

01:16:34.053 --> 01:16:34.987
How do you feel?

01:16:38.123 --> 01:16:39.291
I don't know.

01:16:42.261 --> 01:16:44.096
I didn't think
this would happen.

01:16:44.129 --> 01:16:45.331
So soon in my life.

01:16:49.368 --> 01:16:51.003
But the thought of it,
it's kind of nice.

01:16:56.108 --> 01:16:57.743
After everything
you've been through,

01:16:59.545 --> 01:17:00.813
this will be a blessing.

01:17:04.883 --> 01:17:07.519
The father doesn't need
to worry about this.

01:17:07.553 --> 01:17:08.887
He doesn't even need to know.

01:17:09.955 --> 01:17:11.323
I don't need anything from him.

01:17:11.357 --> 01:17:13.559
I can take care of this all completely by myself alone.

01:17:14.627 --> 01:17:15.561
Calm down.

01:17:16.962 --> 01:17:17.963
Nobody needs to know.

01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:23.535
Your father?

01:17:26.839 --> 01:17:27.906
I'll talk to him.

01:17:29.842 --> 01:17:30.710
Promise.

01:17:36.015 --> 01:17:38.317
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:17:42.354 --> 01:17:43.822
I care about you so much.

01:17:47.426 --> 01:17:49.495
And the fruits you
bring into this world.

01:17:54.433 --> 01:17:55.901
I'm gonna get you a good doctor.

01:17:57.136 --> 01:17:59.438
And make sure you are healthy

01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:01.106
and strong
throughout all of this.

01:18:02.908 --> 01:18:03.777
Okay?

01:18:12.719 --> 01:18:13.687
Thank you.

01:18:18.123 --> 01:18:19.058
Get some rest.

01:18:20.192 --> 01:18:21.126
You're gonna need it.

01:18:24.563 --> 01:18:26.598
This is the doctor's office?

01:18:26.633 --> 01:18:28.934
Don't be fooled
by the exterior. It's LA.

01:18:28.967 --> 01:18:30.737
So many of these, the
buildings look like shit

01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:32.838
and on the inside,
places of gold.

01:18:32.871 --> 01:18:34.273
What's wrong?

01:18:34.306 --> 01:18:37.276
I'm just not feeling so good.

01:18:37.309 --> 01:18:39.078
It's probably morning sickness.

01:18:39.779 --> 01:18:41.180
Come on. Let's get you inside.

01:18:41.213 --> 01:18:42.448
The doctor
will take care of you.

01:18:46.485 --> 01:18:49.922
Marakya, hi, I'm Dr. Tate.

01:18:49.955 --> 01:18:51.924
I'm gonna be
taking care of you today.

01:18:51.957 --> 01:18:54.159
Nurse Nikkie is gonna be
asking you questions.

01:18:56.128 --> 01:18:57.963
Hi, there. How old are you?

01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:00.165
Twenty-seven.

01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:01.801
When was the last time
you had food?

01:19:03.202 --> 01:19:05.672
Uh, last night.

01:19:05.705 --> 01:19:07.707
Honey, have you
had any water today?

01:19:08.207 --> 01:19:09.074
Nope.

01:19:10.342 --> 01:19:11.811
This is um...

01:19:13.412 --> 01:19:15.414
Why are you wearing that?

01:19:18.217 --> 01:19:19.719
Just relax.

01:19:20.419 --> 01:19:23.555
This is... It's just a checkup.

01:19:23.589 --> 01:19:25.924
Doctor!

01:19:25.958 --> 01:19:28.394
Oh, Marakya,
we need you to lie down, sweetheart.

01:19:28.427 --> 01:19:29.928
We need you to be still. Okay?

01:19:29.962 --> 01:19:31.530
- Lie down.
- Just lie down for a little bit.

01:19:31.563 --> 01:19:33.666
I will take care of you today.
But you need to be still.

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.334
- Anthony!
- We need you to be still.

01:19:35.367 --> 01:19:36.902
- Security!
- Security!

01:19:36.935 --> 01:19:39.204
- Anthony!
- I need you to be still so we can take care of you.

01:19:39.773 --> 01:19:40.807
Anthony!

01:19:51.885 --> 01:19:53.986
I gave her
10 ccs to calm her down.

01:19:55.889 --> 01:19:56.756
And Paul...

01:19:58.257 --> 01:20:00.894
I want you to make sure nothing
like this can ever happen again.

01:20:02.461 --> 01:20:03.629
I understand.

01:20:29.955 --> 01:20:30.824
Oh.

01:21:22.976 --> 01:21:23.977
Anthony.

01:21:24.543 --> 01:21:25.712
What?

01:21:27.179 --> 01:21:28.247
Honey, we got a problem.

01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:32.284
What is it?

01:21:33.653 --> 01:21:35.053
It's Marakya.

01:21:36.756 --> 01:21:38.090
She's freaking out.

01:21:38.123 --> 01:21:41.861
She's screaming,
she's upsetting the other girls.

01:21:45.163 --> 01:21:46.298
It's a liability.

01:21:46.331 --> 01:21:48.300
God damn it.

01:21:50.302 --> 01:21:51.771
You know, uh,

01:21:53.773 --> 01:21:56.709
I'm gonna have to tell
your father, don't you?

01:21:58.544 --> 01:22:03.750
So if...
If I asked you not to...

01:22:06.853 --> 01:22:07.754
For me?

01:22:09.388 --> 01:22:10.622
Would you consider it?

01:22:14.359 --> 01:22:15.527
I wish I could.

01:22:18.497 --> 01:22:19.699
I've got to tell him.

01:22:22.234 --> 01:22:23.168
Sue...

01:22:24.136 --> 01:22:25.237
I'm really sorry.

01:22:32.812 --> 01:22:34.179
Oh, boy!

01:22:59.338 --> 01:23:00.673
Do you really wanna do this?

01:23:02.909 --> 01:23:03.776
Yes.

01:23:04.509 --> 01:23:05.712
But do you need to?

01:23:08.246 --> 01:23:09.181
I do.

01:24:36.803 --> 01:24:38.403
Dad, I think we
have some other options

01:24:38.437 --> 01:24:39.337
before we get there.

01:24:41.841 --> 01:24:43.176
What options?

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.510
I'm saying we
can explore all possibilities

01:24:45.544 --> 01:24:46.713
before we make
a decision like that.

01:24:46.746 --> 01:24:49.649
There are no other options.

01:24:49.682 --> 01:24:51.684
This girl, uh...

01:24:51.718 --> 01:24:52.885
Marakya.

01:24:53.552 --> 01:24:55.955
She was Alderson's favorite.

01:24:56.823 --> 01:24:57.990
It has to be his.

01:25:00.126 --> 01:25:02.095
Yes. And I'm telling you,
it doesn't matter

01:25:02.128 --> 01:25:03.528
because I've already
taken care of it.

01:25:12.739 --> 01:25:15.273
He's going to run for president.

01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:26.451
She's not gonna be
a problem for him.

01:25:26.485 --> 01:25:28.353
You are not hearing me, son.

01:25:28.386 --> 01:25:31.456
Please, trust me.

01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:36.561
My mind is made up.

01:25:36.595 --> 01:25:38.030
- Dad...
- I need to know...

01:25:39.431 --> 01:25:40.666
Can you take care of this

01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:43.468
or do I have to outsource this
to somebody who I can rely on?

01:25:44.904 --> 01:25:46.072
You can rely on me.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.976
Yeah.

01:25:50.009 --> 01:25:51.711
I don't know
about that these days.

01:25:51.744 --> 01:25:52.979
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.582
You know, you've
disappointed me lately.

01:26:09.427 --> 01:26:10.395
Come here.

01:26:11.664 --> 01:26:14.299
Come here.

01:26:19.906 --> 01:26:24.476
Do not disappoint me again

01:26:26.311 --> 01:26:27.345
or you're out.

01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:36.321
- Out?
- Out.

01:26:36.354 --> 01:26:39.225
I'm sorry, son,
but that's the way it has to be.

01:26:40.927 --> 01:26:42.061
Grab a couple of cups.

01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:29.402
Marakya, please
do not do this.

01:28:30.435 --> 01:28:31.370
This is insane.

01:28:31.404 --> 01:28:32.271
That...

01:28:32.939 --> 01:28:34.240
that out there is death.

01:28:35.641 --> 01:28:36.742
You can still walk away.

01:28:37.843 --> 01:28:39.979
Alex, they didn't
just take my baby...

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.516
they made it so I could
never bear children.

01:28:47.687 --> 01:28:48.654
They took my life.

01:28:49.655 --> 01:28:50.723
Look at me...

01:28:52.457 --> 01:28:54.760
I wasn't raised
by my birth parents,

01:28:56.262 --> 01:28:57.997
and I'm glad that it wasn't.

01:28:59.865 --> 01:29:01.533
I won't be able to go on
until he's gone.

01:29:01.566 --> 01:29:03.069
They will kill you.

01:29:04.569 --> 01:29:06.739
And I won't be able
to show up and help you.

01:29:08.441 --> 01:29:09.442
No one will.

01:29:12.845 --> 01:29:13.779
I got this.

01:29:17.817 --> 01:29:18.751
It's going to be okay.

01:29:37.670 --> 01:29:40.106
<i>I'm scared
of Anthony, Marakya...</i>

01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:43.743
and you should be, too.

01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:46.812
<i>Then help me stop him.</i>

01:29:46.846 --> 01:29:47.780
<i>I can't.</i>

01:29:48.848 --> 01:29:50.182
My dad is sick.

01:29:51.516 --> 01:29:52.985
He needs money,

01:29:53.019 --> 01:29:55.121
if I don't figure out a way to get
it for him, then he's going to die.

01:29:57.056 --> 01:29:58.924
<i>If you want to do this,</i>

01:29:58.958 --> 01:30:00.359
<i>you're gonna have
to do it alone.</i>

01:30:03.062 --> 01:30:04.196
I'm sorry.

01:31:01.619 --> 01:31:02.521
Hey, kiddo.

01:31:05.858 --> 01:31:08.360
You're not gonna
believe me, but...

01:31:08.394 --> 01:31:10.830
I'm sure happy to
see you again.

01:31:12.597 --> 01:31:13.899
Where is everyone?

01:31:13.933 --> 01:31:15.134
Where are the guards?

01:31:15.801 --> 01:31:16.802
There's no need.

01:31:18.237 --> 01:31:19.572
Because I don't want
to kill you.

01:31:21.307 --> 01:31:22.641
And you're not gonna kill me.

01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:25.644
Oh, yeah?

01:31:26.745 --> 01:31:28.347
Why's that?

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.483
Because it's not me
who wants you dead.

01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.255
Come on, I care about you.

01:31:37.556 --> 01:31:38.457
You know that.

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:42.394
All I've ever wanted
to do is protect you.

01:31:45.131 --> 01:31:46.365
But I couldn't.

01:31:48.634 --> 01:31:49.602
He wouldn't let me.

01:31:52.905 --> 01:31:53.806
Who?

01:31:56.976 --> 01:31:58.444
Just come talk to me.

01:31:59.678 --> 01:32:01.447
Talk to me,
and let me explain.

01:32:07.253 --> 01:32:08.387
Who is he?

01:32:10.055 --> 01:32:11.924
Tell me his name.

01:32:11.957 --> 01:32:13.692
Who is he?

01:32:19.165 --> 01:32:20.766
All right, boys,
that's enough.

01:32:20.799 --> 01:32:21.734
Kill the power.

01:32:40.085 --> 01:32:41.253
Get her up.

01:32:43.022 --> 01:32:44.658
Hold on, let's check.

01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:46.559
All right, sunshine,
up you get.

01:32:46.592 --> 01:32:47.326
Come on.

01:32:47.359 --> 01:32:48.561
Yeah, that's right.

01:32:49.628 --> 01:32:51.263
Does she have any other
weapons on her?

01:32:52.198 --> 01:32:53.332
Just this.

01:32:53.699 --> 01:32:54.567
Keep it.

01:32:55.201 --> 01:32:56.302
Merry Christmas.

01:32:59.772 --> 01:33:00.973
Some fucking fire in you.

01:33:06.278 --> 01:33:07.647
I never wanted
any of this.

01:33:10.382 --> 01:33:11.550
But my father, he...

01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:18.958
I can't say no to him.

01:33:21.093 --> 01:33:22.361
He's given me everything.

01:33:24.797 --> 01:33:26.765
And he expects nothing
less in return.

01:33:33.105 --> 01:33:34.006
The fuck is that?

01:33:35.307 --> 01:33:36.275
Perimeter's clear...

01:33:37.711 --> 01:33:38.645
...we found this.

01:33:42.147 --> 01:33:43.582
The fuck's in the bag,
sweetheart?

01:33:52.424 --> 01:33:53.559
Wait a minute.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.501
I know this one.

01:34:08.675 --> 01:34:09.975
You really fucking killed him?

01:34:15.047 --> 01:34:16.382
Poor fucking Kellin.

01:34:20.886 --> 01:34:22.788
At least his dad isn't
too far behind him.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.627
What other surprises
we got in here, huh?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.535
What is this?

01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:39.938
Did you write me a note, baby?

01:34:47.012 --> 01:34:47.913
Holy fuck!

01:34:51.984 --> 01:34:53.419
In case anyone is wondering,

01:34:54.186 --> 01:34:55.354
it said, "fuck you."

01:34:59.759 --> 01:35:02.928
No, God, get off me!

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:11.603
Get the fuck off me.

01:35:53.278 --> 01:35:54.714
Should we tape her mouth shut?

01:35:56.215 --> 01:35:57.684
No.

01:35:59.351 --> 01:36:01.153
I wanna hear this bitch scream.

01:36:14.333 --> 01:36:16.001
Anyone have eyes?

01:36:47.533 --> 01:36:48.668
Where'd he go?

01:36:52.839 --> 01:36:54.741
He's right here.

01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:12.090
You fucking traitor.

01:37:14.293 --> 01:37:15.829
I was never on your side.

01:37:16.395 --> 01:37:17.629
I was just a driver.

01:37:18.865 --> 01:37:20.032
Well, I hope it's worth it,

01:37:20.065 --> 01:37:22.601
when I burn you out there
next to your whore.

01:37:22.635 --> 01:37:24.671
Hope then you fucking...

01:37:26.205 --> 01:37:27.506
Holy fuck.

01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:30.509
Thank you.

01:37:30.542 --> 01:37:31.678
Yeah, sure.

01:37:33.111 --> 01:37:34.914
Jesus, warn me, man.

01:37:35.447 --> 01:37:37.483
- Sorry.
- Ah.

01:37:37.516 --> 01:37:40.285
Son of a bitch!

01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:46.225
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:37:46.258 --> 01:37:47.559
This is how it's gonna go.

01:37:47.593 --> 01:37:50.930
Me and this one are getting
into Anthony's car, okay?

01:37:50.964 --> 01:37:52.799
I get to the car,
I let her go.

01:37:52.832 --> 01:37:55.567
- Okay.
- You stop me, she dies.

01:37:56.235 --> 01:37:58.103
You're gonna let her go?

01:37:58.136 --> 01:38:00.172
Look, I just, I just want
to get out of here, man.

01:38:02.474 --> 01:38:03.609
Okay, it's a deal.

01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:05.745
I know you.

01:38:06.612 --> 01:38:07.780
- You were one of them.
- Okay.

01:38:07.814 --> 01:38:09.248
you were one of them.

01:38:09.281 --> 01:38:10.917
- Marakya, stop.
- You held me down in the doctor's office.

01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:11.851
Stop struggling.

01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:27.432
He was not yours to kill.

01:38:27.466 --> 01:38:28.701
He wasn't yours to kill.

01:38:28.735 --> 01:38:30.670
Stop, Marakya. Marakya.

01:38:30.703 --> 01:38:32.271
- Marakya, stop.
- He wasn't yours...

01:38:32.304 --> 01:38:34.707
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:38:34.741 --> 01:38:36.843
- He wasn't...
- Marakya, stop.

01:38:36.876 --> 01:38:39.646
It's okay, it's okay.
It's over.

01:38:45.284 --> 01:38:46.653
It's over. It's over.

01:38:47.954 --> 01:38:50.823
- He wasn't yours to kill.
- I'm sorry.

01:38:59.498 --> 01:39:00.833
it's over now.

01:39:14.047 --> 01:39:15.180
Are you laughing?

01:39:15.815 --> 01:39:17.616
Why is she laughing?

01:39:19.052 --> 01:39:20.285
I think you know.

01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:22.889
Come on.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.062
No fucking way.

01:39:30.029 --> 01:39:31.064
Yep.

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:33.265
Anything?

01:39:33.933 --> 01:39:34.801
Jesus.

01:39:56.555 --> 01:39:57.824
Rice?

01:40:07.165 --> 01:40:08.367
Oh, my God.

01:40:10.435 --> 01:40:12.237
Yes.

01:40:13.673 --> 01:40:16.776
Yes, fucking yes.
Here hold it. Come on.

01:40:19.578 --> 01:40:20.780
It's heavy.

01:40:20.813 --> 01:40:22.381
It's really heavy.

01:40:24.616 --> 01:40:25.952
Oh, my God.

01:40:35.494 --> 01:40:36.963
Wow. Yeah!

01:40:36.996 --> 01:40:40.465
Are you fucking kidding me? Look at this!

01:40:40.499 --> 01:40:41.834
All of that shit?

01:40:41.868 --> 01:40:45.370
- Finally.
- Yes, yes!

01:40:56.849 --> 01:40:58.583
Hey.

01:40:58.617 --> 01:41:00.887
<i>It looks like they're
not going to charge him.</i>

01:41:01.788 --> 01:41:02.922
It's as we figured.

01:41:04.489 --> 01:41:06.358
Motherfucker covered his tracks.

01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:12.230
When are you gonna do it?

01:41:15.367 --> 01:41:18.503
Actually, I'm taking care
of that right now.

01:41:21.974 --> 01:41:23.076
Good.

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:26.211
Come visit when you're done.

01:41:26.679 --> 01:41:28.114
Cool.

01:41:28.147 --> 01:41:29.816
Might need a place
to lay low for a while.

01:41:40.059 --> 01:41:41.928
I might know
the perfect place.
