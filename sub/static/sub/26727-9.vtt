00:01.001 --> 00:02.460
YUKIMORI

00:04.129 --> 00:06.131
The personnel allocation
for Division 5 has been decided.

00:07.090 --> 00:11.094
Assistant Inspector Ishimaru of Squad A
will lead Squad F starting today.

00:11.386 --> 00:14.806
Former squad leader Sawazaki and Asami
of Division 1 will work under him.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.309
I never thought I would be able
to work with you again.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.979
-I requested it! Forced it, even!
-What?

00:21.688 --> 00:24.274
Kikuhara proposed to change the leaders.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.818
At first, there were no plans
to add anyone to Squad F.

00:27.152 --> 00:31.114
Then, suddenly, he said you can't control
your vampire subordinates.

00:31.781 --> 00:32.991
I can't accept this.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.200
Or Kikuhara.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.162
Or the new leader he wants
to replace you with so badly.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.413
I don't trust them.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.331
New squad leader.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.833
Now that he's the new leader,

00:42.167 --> 00:44.461
I'll have to introduce him
to Anzai and Jill, but...

00:44.794 --> 00:47.338
You won't let me meet anyone else?

00:48.256 --> 00:50.759
Based on the state of the crime scene
and the witness testimony,

00:50.842 --> 00:55.180
it's possible that the missing
Ryunosuke Katagiri was injured.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.725
Yet there's no sign that you,
a former Investigation Division 1 member,

00:58.808 --> 01:01.561
checked any hospitals around the vicinity.

01:02.020 --> 01:05.440
In other words, you know where he is.

01:05.982 --> 01:08.401
The hostage Officer Anzai saved,

01:08.777 --> 01:12.697
and the unidentified foreigner
he was with.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.450
Gather all those involved.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.329
This is an order from your superior.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.173
Mr. Anzai!

02:54.632 --> 02:55.758
Do you want some coffee?

02:56.426 --> 02:57.510
Yes, please.

02:59.012 --> 03:03.683
To be able to see him like this
makes me feel like we're living together.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.020
We're talking about having another base.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.855
Yes, I heard.

03:09.188 --> 03:11.482
The bar owner said he would
let us use his warehouse.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.319
Here. It's hot, be careful.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.195
Yes, thank you.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.866
What are you doing?

03:20.575 --> 03:21.409
Sorry.

03:21.492 --> 03:24.037
Well, sorry to bother you, but...

03:25.455 --> 03:28.958
Sawazaki told us to go down.
Seems like the new squad leader is here.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.586
New squad leader? What do you mean?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.339
I don't know either.
But he asked all of us to go down.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.132
Usually, he just wants the squad.

03:37.008 --> 03:37.926
It's my fault.

03:38.092 --> 03:40.511
They found out I disobeyed
the standby order and went out.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.894
Why do you look like
you're the one responsible?

03:49.437 --> 03:50.605
Don't worry.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.699
This is former Assistant Inspector
Ishimaru of Squad A.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.202
He'll become Squad F's leader from today.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.037
I'm now a normal squad member.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.415
Asami from Division 1
will join us temporarily.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.834
Formalities are a pain.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.962
It's fine to drop the honorifics
and speak casually.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.714
You guys must be Anzai,
Ms. Hostage, Yanagi,

04:16.798 --> 04:19.467
Mr. Foreigner, and Lloyd.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.719
But, Katagiri isn't here.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.263
He's receiving treatment right now.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.099
There's another thing
I'm hesitant to bring up.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.934
For two months, Anzai and Jill

04:28.226 --> 04:30.228
are prohibited from going outside
without a human escort.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.730
Before, it only applied to work,

04:33.398 --> 04:35.024
but now, it also applies
to personal business--

04:35.108 --> 04:36.359
Are you joking?

04:36.609 --> 04:38.695
Why is there a need to go that far?

04:38.945 --> 04:41.823
Sawazaki was enough for us as a leader...

04:42.031 --> 04:45.243
You can't do your job
by playing best friends, Lloyd.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.246
Well, I understand your feelings.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.165
But we need to prioritize
solving the case.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.502
First, I want to know
what happened at the hotel.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.714
Oh, right. What should I do about that?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.507
Is it okay to tell him?

04:59.841 --> 05:02.176
What if this guy is a spy like Ushio?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.053
You seem troubled, Anzai!

05:04.512 --> 05:06.222
Can you trust him and tell him?

05:07.348 --> 05:09.142
Personally, I can't.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.479
Well, Asami. Feel free to perform
a background check on me.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.566
If knowing whether I'm trustworthy or not

05:16.649 --> 05:18.901
is important to the investigation,
then you should confirm it.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.488
While you're at it, please look into
Inspector Kikuhara as well.

05:22.989 --> 05:23.948
Kikuhara?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.658
Because the one who demoted Sawazaki,

05:25.742 --> 05:29.454
and recommended that I become
the squad leader is Kikuhara.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.124
Well then, run along and start
your investigations.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.918
It's fine if I don't meddle, right?

05:37.920 --> 05:40.590
Mr. Anzai, can I talk to you?

05:41.966 --> 05:42.800
After that,

05:43.509 --> 05:46.304
Zero-Nine apologized for getting me
involved and gave me this.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.642
But Zero-Nine and Zero-Seven
already left the CCC.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.604
I was wondering if we could use this
without arresting them.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.105
POST A MESSAGE IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

05:56.189 --> 05:57.023
I see.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.651
But, if we're talking
about helping them in this case...

06:01.444 --> 06:04.655
Then we must contact them,
and make them come to us.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.990
-You're here?
-You're here?

06:06.074 --> 06:08.076
You're not a vampire, right?

06:08.409 --> 06:09.702
Oh, is it my eyes?

06:09.786 --> 06:12.914
They're from lack of sleep
due to reading manga and novels.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.875
Unlike yours, they're just a sign
that I'm unhealthy.

06:16.709 --> 06:20.421
Anyway, Ms. Hostage,
this is a major achievement.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.008
I see.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.970
So, the Ikebukuro incident
was staged by the CCC.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.307
To raise to the public
that vampires should be exterminated.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.519
By the way, about Ushio being Zero-Five,

06:34.852 --> 06:36.270
did you report it to the higher-ups?

06:36.521 --> 06:37.355
If that's the case,

06:37.438 --> 06:40.983
it will be reported
to Supreme Commander Kikuhara.

06:41.109 --> 06:41.943
Wait a minute.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.779
Wasn't Kikuhara the one
who deployed Ushio to the hotel?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.615
If Kikuhara is also a part of the CCC,

06:47.990 --> 06:49.575
he would let Ushio escape first.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.244
That's true.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.622
If that's going to add up
to all the spies we can't track,

06:54.705 --> 06:58.751
I prefer that he stay in Division 5,
where we can keep an eye on him.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.421
Even if Kikuhara is suspicious,
I'm different.

07:02.713 --> 07:06.676
That's why I want to get in touch
with Zero-Seven and Zero-Nine

07:06.884 --> 07:10.471
to negotiate with them
and get information about the CCC.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.348
Are we working with suspects?

07:12.640 --> 07:14.767
We'll think about arresting them and all
after that.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.354
So, Ms. Hostage, please cooperate.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.065
You want to involve her
in the investigation?

07:21.190 --> 07:23.276
Do you have any idea
how much danger she's in already?

07:23.359 --> 07:26.737
But Ms. Hostage is the only one
connected to them.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.949
Besides, isn't it fine
as long as you're there?

07:30.783 --> 07:32.326
Vampires are strong

07:32.702 --> 07:34.662
and way more reliable than humans.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.498
What are you saying?

07:37.915 --> 07:41.210
If you're worried, you can join
the Negotiations Team.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.713
You gave her our web address?

07:44.172 --> 07:45.339
I'm sorry!

07:45.423 --> 07:46.257
YOU HAVE ONE NEW POST

07:46.340 --> 07:48.551
But, we did do something bad to her.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.636
What are we going to do if we get tracked?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.930
We can erase the site itself immediately.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.933
I've also worked on
making us unidentifiable.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.478
So, what did she say?

07:59.145 --> 08:01.772
Zero-Nine, did you get away safely?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.066
Has Zero-Seven's wound healed?

08:04.984 --> 08:06.736
Sorry for contacting you.

08:07.278 --> 08:11.491
But we might be able to capture the CCC

08:11.741 --> 08:14.160
while still protecting both of you.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.079
When are the negotiations?

08:17.622 --> 08:18.539
In three days.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.083
I'm so glad
Zero-Seven and Zero-Nine responded.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.252
Anyway, what is it? You wanted to talk.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.673
Oh, I just thought
I wanted some free time.

08:27.965 --> 08:28.925
What are you going to do?

08:29.175 --> 08:32.386
To get some groceries, I guess.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.097
Don't look at me that way.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.477
I'll give you my contact address
and phone number. Give me your phone.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.270
Your curfew is 6:00 p.m.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.313
That's early!

08:43.105 --> 08:45.149
Give me your number too, Tsukasa!

08:45.274 --> 08:46.943
-Sure.
-There's no need!

08:49.320 --> 08:53.074
Don't tell me. When you went
to save Tsukasa and avoid me,

08:53.282 --> 08:55.910
it was because you thought
I would steal her from you.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.455
You took it seriously
when I said I'll take her away from you?

08:59.580 --> 09:00.414
What?

09:00.706 --> 09:02.041
I'm off!

09:02.333 --> 09:03.376
See you later!

09:05.002 --> 09:06.170
You better come back.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.510
Did you open up to Lee a bit more?

09:13.219 --> 09:15.429
Who knows?

09:16.055 --> 09:19.225
Here you go. Two doses during the day,
and two at night.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.520
Feng, this is too much for one day!

09:22.728 --> 09:24.689
I have a lot of blood, so it's fine!

09:25.314 --> 09:28.734
Keep your promise.
If you don't, I'll stop asking you.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.239
You know when it's too much, right?
I mean, you're a doctor.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.658
Well, that may be the case, but...

09:36.617 --> 09:38.869
Just lie down for now.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.249
Single-eye transformation.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.962
Only one part of the body transforms,
and you don't lose your mind.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.756
I guess that's the perk
of being a half-vampire.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.427
But aside from me,
there aren't any other cases.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.513
Then, maybe it's a unique ability
that only you have.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.973
That would trouble me.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.308
I want to teach a guy

10:00.391 --> 10:02.393
who's also a half-vampire
to build a tolerance for blood.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.979
Does that mean you've made a friend?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.188
Congratulations!

10:07.481 --> 10:08.774
Thank you.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.445
Oh, are you staying with that friend now?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.657
Well, it's kind of a big place
where different people gather.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.577
Your home isn't here.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.830
How wide is the sky?

10:23.497 --> 10:26.167
The color changes depending
on the time. Right?

10:27.209 --> 10:28.044
The sky

10:28.628 --> 10:32.673
is a boundless space
that stretches above the vast earth.

10:34.008 --> 10:34.925
Why are you running away?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.094
I'll come back after observing the sky.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.220
Who are you?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.141
If you return, you won't be able
to get away next time.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.811
There are other things
you must know besides the sky.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.737
Decide where you belong.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.697
See you later!

10:57.239 --> 10:58.491
You better come back!

11:00.701 --> 11:03.704
The people you live with now
seem like a big family.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.623
I'm not their family.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.710
I'm only there to teach him
how to build a tolerance for blood.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.546
When that's over, I'll be dismissed.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.341
What's the guy you're teaching like?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.968
A coward who acts brave, I think.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.763
But his girlfriend
is surprisingly proactive.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.307
Together, they're a couple of crybabies.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.644
Your complete opposite, then.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.941
Go back to them.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.653
Welcome back!

11:51.794 --> 11:52.628
I'm back!

11:54.547 --> 11:55.548
I'll tell you now.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.676
I don't trust the police.

11:59.176 --> 12:03.431
I don't trust you guys 100 percent either.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.559
Well then, I'll present our conditions.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.479
One. We will prepare your accommodation.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.191
Two. We will provide living expenses
and necessary financial aid.

12:14.483 --> 12:15.484
And three.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.696
We won't arrest you for the time being.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.906
"For the time being"?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.616
Those are some cowardly words.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.536
They're also honest.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.289
So, what is it that you want?

12:28.873 --> 12:32.710
Anything you can give me about the CCC.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.379
A member list or account books,
for example.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.381
We don't have such things.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.925
If I hacked into the hideout's computer,

12:40.259 --> 12:42.386
I think I could have a look
at their accounting and all.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.346
Don't say anything unnecessary, Zero-Nine.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.099
The accounts have our entries as well.

12:48.225 --> 12:52.146
Frankly, I could arrest you immediately.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.567
I only want the accounts
to stop the CCC completely.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.652
If that's so, it's not worth it for us.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.281
Then make it worth your while
and increase the conditions.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.575
Do you have any wishes?

13:08.496 --> 13:12.833
What was Kenichi Morisawa like,
a vampire who died 15 years ago?

13:13.751 --> 13:14.710
That's what I want to know.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.794
CHIZU RESIDENCE

13:15.878 --> 13:18.589
Nanako was a quiet child

13:19.673 --> 13:23.594
until she hated even looking
at the word "vampire."

13:23.886 --> 13:27.306
I wonder when I noticed
that she had gotten over it.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.099
-Gotten over it?
-Yes.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.394
She started bringing up the topic herself.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.439
But she sounded biased against them.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.107
I warned her once, but...

13:39.777 --> 13:42.571
KENICHI MORISAWA

13:42.655 --> 13:43.739
SEARCH YIELDED 1 RESULT

13:43.822 --> 13:44.698
ASSIGNMENT I 069

13:45.491 --> 13:49.453
Inspecting Assignment I cases
require special permission.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.790
They're internal affairs.
In short, scandals.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.168
Kenichi Morisawa.
He was 32 years old at the time.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.462
Public Safety Division 5
Section 2 of AR Squad.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.925
Zero-Seven's mother, Sayuri Tenjo.
She was 33 years old at the time.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.010
A worker at Hachioji City Hall.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.347
After she was widowed,
she lived with her daughter, Nanako.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.808
They dated for about a year,

14:11.016 --> 14:14.228
and Morisawa eventually
started staying over.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.064
There were times that he played
with her daughter, Nanako.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.985
Then one night, Morisawa hugged Nanako.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.445
Sayuri saw it and shot him with a gun.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.905
That's how the incident began.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.325
Does that mean she shot him
because he transformed?

14:28.701 --> 14:29.535
Probably.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.036
Inside Sayuri's diary,

14:31.120 --> 14:34.540
there was an entry about Morisawa
discussing his bloodlust with her.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.917
Anything about his conduct at work?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.127
There was.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.129
"Extremely serious
and outstanding at work."

14:40.379 --> 14:42.882
Personality-wise, he was kind, sociable,

14:42.965 --> 14:44.925
and didn't talk about himself much.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.136
Sayuri's bullet missed.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.638
Morisawa snatched the gun and shot Sayuri.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.309
He then drank her blood and raped her
as she was dying in front of her daughter.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.603
The shaken Nanako snatched the gun

14:55.811 --> 14:59.398
and accidentally fired it,
shooting Morisawa in the head.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.902
I wonder if Zero-Seven liked Morisawa.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.113
Wasn't it the other way around?

15:07.114 --> 15:08.282
It's just my intuition.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.536
When you're a child, you tend
to fall in love with adults close to you.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.916
I don't know if it was romantic love
or familial love,

15:17.708 --> 15:20.336
but it might be true that she adored him.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.759
Killing someone you love
with your own hands

15:27.343 --> 15:28.719
is extremely sad.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.390
Let's go inside. We'll catch a cold.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.562
Killing someone you love...

15:39.563 --> 15:40.981
It's scary just thinking about it.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.028
Regardless whether there was
any intent to kill,

15:46.654 --> 15:48.989
it wounded her deeply and made her cold.

15:49.323 --> 15:53.035
After that, she suddenly started
claiming her hatred of vampires.

15:53.786 --> 15:57.331
Her adoptive father, Kousuke Chizu,
was a professor at East Bay University.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.541
He held study groups at home.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.503
Were there opportunities for her
to meet the participants?

16:03.045 --> 16:03.879
Yes.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.966
There was someone who justified
her act of killing a vampire.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.843
Someone told her killing vampires
was all right,

16:10.260 --> 16:12.179
and gave her the idea
that vampires should be hated.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.222
KIRIO KIKUHARA

16:13.305 --> 16:15.015
The one who saved her heart was...

16:17.017 --> 16:19.478
It's about time we should go.
We'll catch a cold.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.064
Do you think we should work with them?

16:23.357 --> 16:26.443
If we flee, it would be a disadvantage.

16:26.610 --> 16:31.156
But you want to stop Kikuhara
from killing people, right?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.663
Do you like Kikuhara?

16:39.456 --> 16:41.166
What are you saying?

16:41.959 --> 16:45.170
I mean, isn't it that you like Kikuhara?

16:45.879 --> 16:47.172
I can tell just by looking.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.841
I don't like him!

16:49.299 --> 16:51.593
He doesn't even count as human!

16:57.307 --> 16:58.726
Are you Nanako?

16:59.309 --> 17:01.895
I'm good at math. Shall I teach you?

17:03.188 --> 17:06.233
Hardship is the best chance
for one to grow stronger.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.068
Whose words are those?

17:09.028 --> 17:09.862
Mine.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.157
It's 9:01 p.m. Suspect secured.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.368
Look at me! Look into my eyes!

17:17.036 --> 17:19.163
Sooner or later,
vampires will be driven out of society.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.583
Where to?

17:22.833 --> 17:23.751
I don't know.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.961
Maybe they'll just be let loose somewhere.

17:26.587 --> 17:30.507
If we don't isolate or exterminate them,
another vampire like Morisawa may appear.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.719
I don't fall in love

17:35.179 --> 17:37.473
with anyone, do you understand?

17:38.182 --> 17:40.350
I do not want you as a woman.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.436
I have no intention to see you sexually.

17:42.978 --> 17:46.190
If you get that, come with me.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.233
I understood him.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.819
Or should I say, I wanted to.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.988
I didn't truly understand,

17:53.822 --> 17:56.408
even if he warned me
not to fall in love with him.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.620
Nanako...

18:01.330 --> 18:03.415
When I fell for Kikuhara,

18:04.249 --> 18:06.293
I forgot my fear of Morisawa.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.380
I liked Kikuhara.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.510
Was Morisawa's data there?

18:16.512 --> 18:17.930
Can I ask one thing first?

18:18.263 --> 18:20.057
Did Morisawa drink blood before then?

18:20.849 --> 18:21.767
No.

18:25.604 --> 18:29.942
It would be good if she could forgive
Morisawa or all the vampires.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.693
Sawazaki said that.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.780
Rather than think she killed Morisawa,

18:35.280 --> 18:39.201
it might have been easier for her
to think that she killed a vampire.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.247
Any new information?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.083
It's just like I remembered.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.628
Is that so? Looks like we fell short
of your expectations.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.297
-No, this is enough.
-What?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.925
Zero-Nine and I will cooperate with you

18:55.425 --> 18:56.760
to stop Kikuhara.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.764
So, Kikuhara is your comrade!

19:01.098 --> 19:02.349
He is Zero-Two.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.144
Basically, the leader of the CCC.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.437
But we need to find proof.

19:08.063 --> 19:12.860
It's a pity, but with just your testimony,
if he plays innocent, we'll be done.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.362
-What?
-What's that?

19:15.445 --> 19:19.074
-Vanquish the vampires!
-Vanquish the vampires!

19:19.199 --> 19:20.033
VAMPIRES EXIST!

19:20.117 --> 19:21.076
NO MORE IKEBUKURO INCIDENT!

19:21.201 --> 19:22.035
ISOLATE THEM!

19:22.119 --> 19:25.247
-Vanquish the vampires!
-Vanquish the vampires!

19:25.581 --> 19:26.415
This sucks.

19:26.748 --> 19:30.669
Almost everyone only found out about
vampires from the Ikebukuro incident,

19:31.211 --> 19:34.965
but some already knew about them
and didn't think well of them.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.885
We're the vampire vigilante committee!

19:39.469 --> 19:41.555
-Vampire vigilante committee?
-Yes.

19:42.097 --> 19:45.642
There's a group of extremists
at the rally. There's something off...

19:46.226 --> 19:47.477
Hey, Jill! What happened?

19:47.769 --> 19:48.854
I'll contact you later.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.564
Sawazaki?

19:51.315 --> 19:54.067
Are you a vampire?

19:54.735 --> 19:56.195
Stop! Police!

19:56.612 --> 19:59.531
This time it's unrelated
to the CCC, right?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.325
I think so,

20:01.950 --> 20:04.411
but it's not like we're informed
about everything.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.872
Shall I go and confirm that for now?

20:07.122 --> 20:09.917
I'll go! I'm worried
about Sawazaki and the rest.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.294
I'll check out the situation
and meet them there.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.587
Then, I'll go too.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.964
Going out without a human escort...

20:16.048 --> 20:17.925
It's fine as long as I'm there, right?

20:19.134 --> 20:22.179
You're a vampire.
If you cause any problems,

20:22.512 --> 20:25.766
next time won't be settled
with just a little house arrest.

20:25.974 --> 20:29.061
Even if something happens,
please don't take any action.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.729
-Understand?
-Yes.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.523
This is the time for us to unite!

20:33.607 --> 20:35.108
Let's take down the vampires together!

20:35.192 --> 20:37.069
Don't look! They're holding up blood.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.029
Are they trying to expose
the vampires with that?

20:39.112 --> 20:41.490
-Don't hide the vampires!
-Don't hide the vampires!

20:41.573 --> 20:45.535
-Don't hide the vampires!
-Don't hide the vampires!

20:45.619 --> 20:46.787
A vampire!

20:48.580 --> 20:49.831
A vampire escaped!

20:50.290 --> 20:51.291
Stop right there!

20:54.336 --> 20:57.214
Contact Division 5. I'll just let
that vampire escape, then I'll return!

20:57.965 --> 20:58.799
Hey!

20:58.882 --> 20:59.967
I can't just ignore it!

21:01.051 --> 21:02.761
When did I become this way?

21:03.679 --> 21:06.139
The more I chase them, the more
the vampires run into the darkness.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.184
I catch up with them, arrest them,
and take them away.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.853
My body got strangely used to this job.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.856
Why can't I stop going after them?

21:24.908 --> 21:26.994
At least carry some sedatives with you.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.497
Rest for a bit, and you'll be able
to walk again.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.582
I searched for you.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.589
If I hunted vampires down like this,

21:39.715 --> 21:41.758
I thought I would be able
to meet you again.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.885
I'm happy to run into you.

21:45.929 --> 21:46.763
This is...

21:47.014 --> 21:48.015
What happened?

21:48.557 --> 21:51.184
A live broadcast
from the vigilante committee.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.229
Mr. Ochiai?

23:34.037 --> 23:35.038
Devils' Line.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.456
Line 10.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.999
Ego Defense.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.919
