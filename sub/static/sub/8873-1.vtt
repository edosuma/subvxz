00:43.461 --> 00:46.047
You know I love you,
but I can't do this anymore.

00:46.214 --> 00:51.094
You're never there for me.
You're a terrible girlfriend. But...

00:52.011 --> 00:53.805
...you're a wonderful poet.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.182
I'm not a wonderful poet,
I'm an academic.

00:56.391 --> 00:57.684
An unemployed one.

00:57.851 --> 00:59.651
You should send your new poems
to your editor.

00:59.853 --> 01:02.856
She's got dementia.
She might actually like them.

01:03.606 --> 01:06.901
Are you breaking up with me
or giving me a pep talk here?

01:07.110 --> 01:09.404
- Stick with the narrative.
- Please, Elle...

01:09.612 --> 01:12.031
- We always knew it was gonna happen.
- What?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.994
Well, I mean, you're your age,
and I'm rapidly approaching 50.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.079
Heh.

01:18.288 --> 01:21.040
I mean, what did you think
was gonna happen?

01:21.249 --> 01:24.169
You don't need a crystal ball here
or anything.

01:24.377 --> 01:26.337
Do you love me?

01:28.339 --> 01:30.967
Were you ever in love with me?

01:31.926 --> 01:33.470
Because you never said it.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.931
I'm gonna vacuum.

01:37.140 --> 01:42.103
- I thought love conquered everything?
- No. Love does not conquer everything.

01:42.687 --> 01:43.938
Four months, Olivia.

01:44.147 --> 01:47.233
Four fucking months
we've been together.

01:48.568 --> 01:50.945
Try 38 years.

01:51.404 --> 01:54.532
Try being with someone for 38 years.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.455
You're a footnote.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.255
A "footnote"?

02:12.175 --> 02:16.805
- That's a really horrible thing to say.
- Yes, well, I'm a horrible person.

02:17.806 --> 02:20.809
Look, I'm gonna take a shower
before I vacuum.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.602
You can let yourself out.

02:23.228 --> 02:26.314
Okay. Okay, that's it.

02:28.024 --> 02:30.652
- Yup. That's it.
- Goodbye.

02:38.034 --> 02:41.037
Leave your key on the coffee table.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.667
Ahh.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.996
Oh, my God.

05:05.682 --> 05:08.184
- Hey, Sage.
- Hi, Grandma.

05:08.768 --> 05:09.894
What are you doing here?

05:11.062 --> 05:13.731
I just thought I'd drop by. Heh.

05:14.399 --> 05:15.984
Why are you dressed like that?

05:16.192 --> 05:18.528
I've been sitting around
all morning being maudlin.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.530
Come on in. You want some tea?

05:23.032 --> 05:24.283
Um...

05:25.076 --> 05:28.579
- I need some help, Grandma.
- Okay.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.752
So, what's going on?
I'm not a mind-reader.

05:36.254 --> 05:39.841
I need $600, 630.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.635
For what?

05:42.844 --> 05:45.513
Um... I'm pregnant.

05:50.643 --> 05:52.437
Okay.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.983
I don't want to have a baby.
I want to get an abortion. And I'm broke.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.360
And I only have $18.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.404
Is that terrible?

06:02.864 --> 06:05.783
Well, it's nothing to dance a jig about.

06:06.451 --> 06:08.995
- Does your mother know?
- Mom? No. Ugh.

06:09.203 --> 06:13.082
I mean, she would have a stroke,
and then she'd start strangling me...

06:13.291 --> 06:17.754
- ...and then she'll get a stroke.
- Well, she'd strangle you, all right.

06:25.845 --> 06:27.805
I'm such an idiot.

06:28.014 --> 06:29.807
Such an idiot. I'm such an idiot.

06:30.016 --> 06:32.226
Yeah, well, so was I
when I was your age.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.728
What am I gonna do?

06:33.936 --> 06:37.315
Well, you already said
what you're gonna do, right?

06:37.523 --> 06:41.194
I mean, you've put some thought into it.
Haven't you?

06:41.402 --> 06:44.614
Because this is something
that you will probably think about...

06:44.822 --> 06:49.994
...at some moment, every day
for the rest of your life.

06:52.622 --> 06:55.291
So do you have it?
Do you have the money?

06:55.500 --> 06:57.293
Sweetheart, at the moment, I have $43.

06:57.502 --> 06:59.921
- Forty-three dollars. Are you joking?
- Cookies.

07:01.089 --> 07:05.593
- How do you have so little money?
- Because I got sick of being in debt.

07:05.802 --> 07:08.638
So I paid it off.
Every cent I owed.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.224
I wanted the weight off my back.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.310
My God, I still had hospital bills from Vi.

07:14.936 --> 07:16.729
Twenty-seven thousand dollars' worth.

07:16.938 --> 07:18.815
Why didn't you just ask Mom to help?

07:19.941 --> 07:20.983
Why don't you?

07:22.401 --> 07:24.487
- Remember these?
- Yeah.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.990
I don't need help.
I have swept the decks clean.

07:28.199 --> 07:29.408
At the end of next week...

07:29.617 --> 07:31.994
...I have a check coming
from some guest lectures...

07:32.203 --> 07:34.580
- ...I did in Santa Cruz.
- Do you have a credit card?

07:34.789 --> 07:37.667
You know, I cut my credit
cards up into little pieces.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.377
I made a wind chime out of them.

07:39.585 --> 07:43.756
- Why would you do that?
- I'm transmogrifying my life into art.

07:43.965 --> 07:47.093
Oh, my G... You know, what kind of adult
doesn't have a credit card?

07:47.301 --> 07:52.265
This adult. Credit cards infantilize you.
They turn you into a pod person.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.809
- You must have a credit card.
- No, I don't.

07:55.017 --> 07:58.229
Mom confiscated it after I crashed
the car in the garage. Shit!

07:58.437 --> 08:00.314
Wait. Hold on. Hold on!

08:00.523 --> 08:02.108
- What?
- We're gonna deal with this.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.862
First, tell me where you got this
$630 figure.

08:06.070 --> 08:08.156
I went to a clinic called Pine Rapids.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.199
I have an appointment
for the procedure.

08:10.408 --> 08:12.243
- When?
- 5:45.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.744
5:45 today?

08:13.953 --> 08:16.873
Are you fucking out of your mind?
It's already 9:05.

08:17.081 --> 08:20.418
Yes, and they don't have
another appointment open this week.

08:20.626 --> 08:24.714
And I just feel sicker and sicker
and I can't wait. And I feel sick.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.675
I know a women's health clinic
where they help you for free.

08:27.884 --> 08:30.970
Vi used to volunteer there. Come on.

08:31.179 --> 08:33.681
Yeah. Here, grab the cookies.

08:44.150 --> 08:48.070
- You still have Vi's car?
- Course I have Vi's car.

08:55.203 --> 08:56.996
Let's go.

09:03.628 --> 09:05.504
Come on, baby.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.761
Damn it to hell.

09:17.642 --> 09:19.852
Oh, God, I didn't wake you up again,
did I?

09:21.979 --> 09:25.274
- No.
- Oh, good. So glad.

09:27.068 --> 09:29.278
- She's already pregnant.
- Grandma!

09:29.487 --> 09:32.740
I'm just saying.
I see the hormones popping.

09:32.949 --> 09:35.701
No ideas. We're good.
Here, give it a try.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.537
Ah! It's working.

09:40.498 --> 09:43.918
- Ooh. Nice tunes.
- Listen, thanks.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.629
Anytime. Take it to the shop
and get it checked out.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.548
- It runs good.
- Hey, congratulations.

10:08.985 --> 10:11.112
- Where the hell is it?
- I don't know.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.615
- When was the last time you were here?
- I don't know. Maybe 10 years.

10:14.824 --> 10:16.367
Now it's a damn coffee place.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.662
I could use some coffee.

10:21.372 --> 10:26.460
Oh, Jesus, fuck.
I mean, this is... This is the worst.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.171
Women's Health Action Center.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.383
- It closed five years ago.
- How could they close this place down?

10:32.591 --> 10:35.511
Where can you get a reasonably priced
abortion these days?

10:35.720 --> 10:40.016
Because these days
all you can get is this shitty coffee.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.268
How far along are you?
When was your period?

10:42.476 --> 10:45.354
- Ten weeks ago.
- Mine was 25 years ago.

10:45.563 --> 10:47.982
We had a ceremony for it, Vi and I did.

10:48.190 --> 10:52.486
I mean, $600 for an abortion!
What the hell? That is highway robbery.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.239
Quiet.

10:55.448 --> 10:58.576
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

10:59.035 --> 11:02.830
- Excuse me?
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.917
When?
When are you gonna have to ask us?

11:07.126 --> 11:10.296
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.
- Oh, you are asking us?

11:10.504 --> 11:13.049
- Yes, you're disturbing the customers.
- I'm a customer.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.176
- Do you know what a customer is?
- I know what a customer is.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.636
A customer is someone
who pays for your services.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.221
So I am a customer.

11:19.430 --> 11:22.850
I mean, what other customers
are we disturbing?

11:23.017 --> 11:26.103
- Oh, them? Ozzie and Harriet?
- Yes. You're disturbing them.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.899
- No, we're disturbing you. Isn't that right?
- Yes, you are also disturbing me.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.193
Because, what,
I'm talking about abortions?

11:32.401 --> 11:34.570
Do you know this used to be
an abortion clinic?

11:34.737 --> 11:36.497
Take your coffee
and enjoy it somewhere else.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.740
Where you're standing right now...

11:37.948 --> 11:40.534
...there were thousands
of unintended pregnancies terminated.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.495
- Please leave. Leave now.
- No, no.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.331
I'm staying here to enjoy
this $3 drip coffee.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.793
And I've got some additional information:
all coffee drips.

11:49.001 --> 11:52.254
You don't have to say "drip" coffee.
That is a redundancy. Oh, look, it drips.

11:52.463 --> 11:54.340
Oh, my God, it drips so well!

11:54.548 --> 11:58.010
This is the best drip coffee
I think I have ever dripped anywhere.

11:58.219 --> 12:01.430
It's just absolutely fascinating.
Look at this. Hey, hey.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.891
Hey, sis, drop Ozzie sometime
and give me a call.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.935
- Look at this, isn't this good?
- Uh, okay...

12:06.143 --> 12:07.770
- Look, I'm writing your name here.
- I'm so sorry. Let's go.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.815
"Fuck head." What do you mean
you're sorry, goddamn it?

12:11.023 --> 12:13.067
- He's the one that should be sorry.
- Sorry.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.361
- French press coffee.
- What?

12:15.569 --> 12:18.531
- French press coffee doesn't drip.
- Well, I guess not. Touché.

12:20.074 --> 12:22.118
- So who's the guy?
- What?

12:22.993 --> 12:25.121
I assume there was a penis involved.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.748
- Who is he? A one-night stand?
- No. Ew. No.

12:27.957 --> 12:31.001
He's kind of my boyfriend.
Look, I don't know.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.587
You don't know?
If you don't know, who does know?

12:33.796 --> 12:35.506
He was supposed to get me the money
by this morning.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.091
All right.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.553
- And?
- And he didn't get it...

12:40.761 --> 12:43.848
...and he didn't get back to me.
I texted him like a hundred times.

12:45.099 --> 12:48.686
All right, well. This is his problem too.

12:48.894 --> 12:53.232
You understand that, right? Do you?
Do you understand that?

12:53.441 --> 12:55.609
Yeah, I do, but...

12:55.818 --> 12:59.196
- He's not the one who's pregnant.
- That's the fucking problem, isn't it?

12:59.405 --> 13:04.285
He's isn't the one who's pregnant.
He'd be shitting his pants if he were.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.204
He'd find the money
if he thought he was gonna swell up...

13:07.371 --> 13:09.874
- ...like he swallowed a watermelon.
- Yeah.

13:10.082 --> 13:12.126
- So let's go see him.
- Wait. Who? No. Cam?

13:12.334 --> 13:15.754
- That's not a good idea.
- Cam? That's his name?

13:15.963 --> 13:18.424
- Cam? Oh, Cam, Cam.
- Stop. Please.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.677
My heart throb man. Cam, Cam.
Thank you, ma'am.

13:21.886 --> 13:24.847
- Hey, wait up, kid. I've got the keys.
- Stop it.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.808
- You're getting on my nerves now.
- Don't make me fall.

13:28.017 --> 13:30.394
- Oh, please.
- I could break a hip.

14:03.636 --> 14:06.931
Yo, what are you doing here?

14:07.139 --> 14:09.183
Are your parents home?

14:09.767 --> 14:10.809
No.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.645
Can I come in?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.606
Uh... Yeah. Whatever.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.489
Oh, shit.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.992
Um, you were supposed to
bring me the money.

14:27.076 --> 14:28.494
Yeah. I couldn't get it.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.790
That fucking asshole wouldn't front me.
I thought he would. It's bullshit.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.042
But you're gonna have to get
the money, Cam.

14:35.251 --> 14:38.087
- Look, who is this?
- It's my grandma.

14:38.295 --> 14:41.382
Half. Give us half the money.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.259
Yo, Grandma, what you doing here?

14:43.467 --> 14:45.427
You're gonna
have to take responsibility.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.137
- How do I know it was me?
- What?

14:48.222 --> 14:51.350
- You heard me.
- I didn't sleep with anyone else.

14:51.559 --> 14:52.643
You slept with Mike.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.813
Yeah, like a year ago.
And we used a condom.

14:56.021 --> 14:59.692
Yeah, why didn't you use a condom?
Or, for humanity's sake, get a vasectomy?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.736
- What? What did she just say?
- She didn't say anything, okay?

15:02.945 --> 15:05.739
Look, she said it wasn't her time.
Yeah.

15:05.948 --> 15:09.994
Her time? What are you, a moron?
What, are you both morons?

15:10.202 --> 15:12.580
Don't they teach kids sex ed anymore?

15:12.788 --> 15:16.250
- Grandma, you better watch yourself.
- Look at this sorry-ass loser.

15:16.458 --> 15:20.087
Some people should not grow beards.
Your face looks like an armpit.

15:20.296 --> 15:22.131
Grandma, I'm serious.
Don't fuck with me.

15:22.339 --> 15:25.884
- All right, don't fuck with me.
- I'm serious. Give us the money.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.262
I don't have any money, bitch.
I told you that.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.265
- Give us the goddamn money!
- Get out of my home!

15:31.473 --> 15:33.684
Get out of my home,
you crazy old fucking bitch.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.353
Get out, or I'll fuck you up.
I will fuck you up.

15:36.562 --> 15:40.316
- You'll fuck me up?
- I will fuck you up!

15:41.609 --> 15:45.613
- Oh, my... Stop! Hey, hey, stop!
- Oh, you hit me! You hit me!

15:45.821 --> 15:47.364
And I'll hit you again.

15:47.573 --> 15:51.910
- How much money do you have, huh?
- Okay, okay. I have like $50.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.330
- Where is it?
- It's in my sock drawer.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.373
Thank you.

15:57.875 --> 16:02.504
You know, I liked your boyfriend.
He's special. Really charismatic.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.716
I can see exactly
why you're so attracted to him.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.677
Look, this was in his sock drawer too.
Heh, heh.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.931
Mm. Smells so good. Look, red hairs.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.558
See them?

16:15.184 --> 16:17.061
Wait, Sage.

16:17.394 --> 16:20.689
Sage, what are you doing?
Where are you going, sweetheart?

16:20.898 --> 16:22.138
Mom's right, you're crazy!

16:22.316 --> 16:24.818
Because I rapped that little shit
across the knuckles?

16:25.027 --> 16:27.863
- Everyone will talk about it at school!
- What's he gonna say?

16:28.072 --> 16:30.282
- "Sage's grandma beat me up"?
- Yeah.

16:30.491 --> 16:32.451
- You could have killed him.
- No.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.165
Just get off me!

16:41.669 --> 16:44.046
- Okay?
- No, I'm not okay! I'm pregnant!

16:44.254 --> 16:46.006
I'm fucking pregnant, okay?

16:49.343 --> 16:51.178
You know,
you have a real anger problem.

16:51.387 --> 16:53.931
No. No, I don't.
I have an asshole problem.

16:54.390 --> 16:57.017
When people are assholes, I get angry.

16:57.601 --> 17:01.146
Especially when they've been
an asshole to my granddaughter.

17:05.651 --> 17:08.487
Come on, I've got a friend,
she owes me 400 bucks.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.863
Maybe she has it.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.911
Or you can always call your mom
and ask her for the money.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.205
No.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.436
So your mom thinks I'm crazy?

17:41.353 --> 17:44.314
You know she thinks you're crazy.
She thinks I'm crazy too.

17:44.523 --> 17:45.816
You're not crazy enough.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.235
- What do you mean?
- Just an impression.

17:48.444 --> 17:51.113
You need to be able to say
"screw you" sometimes.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.364
I say "screw you."

17:52.573 --> 17:55.242
You didn't say screw you
to that little creep back there.

17:56.452 --> 17:58.495
No, I guess I didn't.

17:59.371 --> 18:02.916
Mom says you have problems
dealing with people sometimes.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.795
- Jesus.
- Ever since Grandma Violet died.

18:07.004 --> 18:10.758
- She says that you're philanthropic.
- Philanthropic? What?

18:12.885 --> 18:16.430
- No, no, wait, misanthropic.
- Oh. Misanthropic.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.724
- Yeah.
- Well...

18:18.932 --> 18:22.728
That's an understatement. Heh.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.654
Honey, watch yourself.

18:33.614 --> 18:37.659
- Hey, there. Is Deathy around?
- Hey, Deathy!

18:37.868 --> 18:38.994
Hold on.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.997
Hey.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.750
- Elle.
- Oh, Deathy.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.086
- It's Elle!
- You look good.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.089
- Look at you.
- No, no, look at you.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.176
- And who's this?
- My granddaughter, Sage.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.969
- Hi.
- No...

18:56.178 --> 18:58.096
I haven't seen you since
you were a baby.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.432
- Really?
- I used to change your diaper.

19:00.599 --> 19:04.520
- Heh. Now I feel old.
- Yeah, well, that's the way it goes.

19:04.728 --> 19:08.690
Hey, Deathy, uh,
remember that 400 bucks?

19:08.899 --> 19:13.028
- Oh, God, Elle. Really?
- I could use it, because she's pregnant.

19:13.403 --> 19:17.908
- Ah. She needs a "Bortion," huh?
- Yeah. She needs a "Bortion."

19:18.116 --> 19:19.796
- Oh, God, you remember that?
- Stop.

19:19.952 --> 19:22.913
We used to have this shtick
where this girl needed a "Bortion."

19:23.121 --> 19:24.873
She didn't know it was called
"an abortion."

19:25.082 --> 19:29.127
- She thought it was called a "Bortion."
- A shtick? That's horrible.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.129
- Yeah, it is, kind of.
- Eh. Maybe.

19:31.797 --> 19:36.552
So, what do you say about the money,
honey? If you have it.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.554
Christ, I wish I did.

19:38.762 --> 19:42.224
Your grandma, she really helped me out
a long time ago.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.435
I had these two defective boobs
that were just leaking...

19:45.644 --> 19:48.689
...leaking silicone all the way
down to my knees. It was awful.

19:48.897 --> 19:53.193
- It was not pretty.
- And Elle here, she really came through.

19:53.402 --> 19:57.489
And now you need me, and I'm broke.
I'm fucking broke again.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.116
Well, you look great.

20:00.701 --> 20:04.788
Hey, you want a tattoo?
Now, that I can do.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.677
- You want a tattoo, darling?
- Oh, no.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.793
- No, thank you. We should probably get...
- How long would it take? A little one?

20:10.002 --> 20:11.753
Oh, not long, honey, 15 minutes tops.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.714
- You know I'm a quick draw.
- What?

20:13.922 --> 20:17.885
I need to collect my thoughts, I'll tell you.
We need to re-strategize.

20:20.679 --> 20:24.683
Don't you have any rich friends?
What about Deanne and Margot?

20:24.892 --> 20:27.102
I kind of gave them hell
last time I saw them.

20:27.311 --> 20:31.899
Because they just disappeared
when Vi got sick. Like everyone else.

20:32.482 --> 20:37.029
- What about all your academic pals?
- Oh, they're so broke and stingy.

20:37.237 --> 20:40.115
Plus they're up in Santa Cruz.
We need the money today.

20:40.866 --> 20:44.119
- What's the O for?
- It's not an O. It's a circle.

20:44.328 --> 20:47.247
- It was the quickest one.
- Yeah, but it looks like an O.

20:47.456 --> 20:52.002
- I thought it was for "orgasm."
- Well, sure. It's for that.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.463
It's not for "Olivia"?

20:55.714 --> 20:58.634
Isn't that the name of your girlfriend?
Olivia?

20:58.842 --> 21:00.928
Can't you just ask her for money?

21:01.136 --> 21:04.056
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Mom said that you did.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.766
And her name was Olivia.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.018
I knew I shouldn't tell
your mother anything.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.646
- Why not?
- Oh, my God, she's so judgmental.

21:10.854 --> 21:15.609
- Judge Judy.
- Yeah. Judge Judy.

21:17.194 --> 21:21.156
- Don't you have a Violet tattoo?
- Yes. That I do.

21:22.491 --> 21:25.494
- Do you miss her? Violet?
- Mm.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.288
I miss her all the time.

21:28.497 --> 21:30.916
That was a quite a love story,
you and Vi.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.918
Course, she put up with a lot.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.962
What do you mean by that?

21:35.170 --> 21:39.216
Nothing, darling.
You know you're not the easiest toke.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.842
But that's why we love you.

21:41.051 --> 21:44.888
Everyone thought Vi was such an angel.
She was the one with the temper.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.556
I remember.

21:47.140 --> 21:51.311
- So, what's the O stand for?
- Well, O is a big letter for women.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.816
- Ovaries. Origami. Openness. Orifice.
- Cheerios. Hello.

21:56.775 --> 22:00.487
- Old. Oven. Odd. Ossuary. Out.
- Olivia.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.532
As it happens, yes.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.617
And...

22:06.118 --> 22:07.703
...all done.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.579
Great circle.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.127
What do you think first editions
are worth?

22:15.335 --> 22:17.713
- Of what? Your stuff?
- Not my stuff.

22:17.921 --> 22:21.049
- That's not worth anything.
- But you're famous.

22:21.258 --> 22:25.804
No. No, I was marginally well-known
40 years ago.

22:26.013 --> 22:28.765
But I have some really valuable
first editions.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.559
- Carla wanted them.
- Who's Carla?

22:30.767 --> 22:35.814
Owns the Bonobo cafe.
I'm gonna sell my first editions.

22:36.023 --> 22:38.623
They're probably worth a few thousand,
I'm gonna give her a break.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.862
See, I told you, Sage,
that this would clear my head.

22:42.070 --> 22:47.534
Okay, $65.
I'm borrowing from the kitty, for the kitty.

22:48.702 --> 22:51.705
- Every little bit adds up, right?
- It does. It really does.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.790
Don't be a stranger, okay?

22:55.709 --> 22:57.294
See there?

23:17.898 --> 23:19.941
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

23:20.150 --> 23:24.863
<i>First message sent today at 11:03.</i>

23:28.283 --> 23:33.330
<i>Second message sent today at 11:04.</i>

23:36.666 --> 23:38.418
<i>You have no more new messages.</i>

23:40.670 --> 23:43.548
- Sage, baby, you okay?
- No. I'm not okay.

23:43.757 --> 23:45.884
- You want some ginger ale?
- I hate ginger ale.

23:46.093 --> 23:49.846
Oh, you love ginger ale. We used to have
those little tea parties, remember?

23:50.055 --> 23:54.184
You didn't like tea,
so we'd put ginger ale in the teapot.

23:54.392 --> 23:57.145
- It's already 12:30. Come on.
- It's gonna be all right.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.689
- How is it gonna be all right?
- We're gonna sell...

23:59.940 --> 24:03.735
...some damn first editions, that's how.
Come on, check them out.

24:06.571 --> 24:09.991
You'll see. That fucking Carla
is gonna go ape-shit over these.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.703
One night at dinner here,
she tried to buy them from me on the spot.

24:14.496 --> 24:18.625
- What is this?
- What is <i>The Feminine Mystique?</i>

24:18.834 --> 24:21.795
You're asking me
what is <i>The Feminine Mystique?</i>

24:22.879 --> 24:24.589
Mystique's a character in <i>X-Men.</i>

24:25.882 --> 24:27.175
What?

24:27.384 --> 24:30.387
Um... Do you want me to Google
how much this is worth on eBay?

24:30.595 --> 24:33.890
Good idea. Google it. The eBay.
Whatever it is.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.895
<i>The Feminine Mystique,</i>
by Betty Friedan.

24:39.104 --> 24:41.940
You know in <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i>
when the curtain gets pulled back...

24:42.149 --> 24:44.359
...and everyone sees
that the Wizard is a fake?

24:44.568 --> 24:47.154
Because Toto the dog
pulled back the curtain.

24:47.362 --> 24:50.949
Well, Betty was like Toto.

24:51.741 --> 24:54.661
- Not the perfect metaphor.
- 53.90.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.956
Five thousand three hundred
and ninety dollars?

24:58.582 --> 25:01.751
No, 53 dollars and 90 cents.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.714
- Look, there's one on sale here on eBay.
- That is damn bullshit!

25:05.922 --> 25:09.384
No. Look. "First edition, good condition,
53 dollars and 90 cents."

25:09.593 --> 25:11.511
No, let me see.

25:12.429 --> 25:15.265
- Christ, how can you read that?
- What is this, a wine stain?

25:15.473 --> 25:18.476
Probably.
Hell, I'm gonna take a bunch of these.

25:18.685 --> 25:22.689
Look at this, "Simone de Beauvoir,
<i>The Prime of Life."</i> Her autobiography.

25:22.898 --> 25:26.610
Dare I ask if you know
who Simone de Beauvoir is?

25:26.818 --> 25:31.948
- No. I have no idea. Guess I'm an idiot.
- Guess you are.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.076
- Screw you.
- What?

25:35.869 --> 25:38.955
Screw you. Screw you, Grandma.

25:39.539 --> 25:40.874
Not bad.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.001
You don't even know who Mystique is.

25:44.836 --> 25:46.296
You're right.

25:47.214 --> 25:49.299
- What's a Bonobo?
- A very advanced ape.

25:49.507 --> 25:52.135
The females run the show,
they masturbate all the time...

25:52.344 --> 25:54.846
...and they don't have wars,
unlike chimps and humans.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.848
So you think women
are better than men?

25:57.057 --> 26:00.560
- Men are okay. My father was a man.
- Mine was a sperm.

26:00.769 --> 26:04.356
Donor. Your mom was busy.
Don't blame her for that.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.690
It was a valid decision.

26:06.483 --> 26:09.903
At least the sperm didn't black your eye
because you talked back.

26:10.111 --> 26:12.197
I wish she could have gotten
the sperm's name.

26:12.405 --> 26:15.283
The only thing I know
is that he must have had curly hair.

26:16.201 --> 26:17.577
Hey, Carla.

26:18.203 --> 26:21.748
- Hey, stranger.
- I brought the books.

26:21.957 --> 26:24.709
- What books?
- The books you wanted to buy from me.

26:24.918 --> 26:27.837
- Okay...
- I got, look. <i>Feminine Mystique.</i>

26:28.046 --> 26:29.631
First edition, signed.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.217
That wine stain?
Left by Betty Friedan herself.

26:32.425 --> 26:36.346
- Mm-hm.
- This is Simone de Beauvoir.

26:36.554 --> 26:39.015
Germaine Greer,
<i>Female Eunuch.</i>

26:39.224 --> 26:41.393
And I'm gonna let you have this
Eileen Myles...

26:41.601 --> 26:44.854
- ...which is absolutely life-changing.
- Mm. Yum.

26:45.063 --> 26:49.109
Yeah. My granddaughter Googled them,
they're worth a lot of money...

26:49.317 --> 26:50.443
...thousands of dollars.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.112
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.115
But I'm gonna let you have them
for 515 bucks...

26:55.323 --> 26:57.909
...but it has to be right now, cash.

27:01.746 --> 27:04.082
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

27:04.291 --> 27:05.375
You're not supposed to be
working today.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.877
Well, Laurel was sick
so Carla asked me to cover.

27:08.086 --> 27:11.214
- What are you doing here?
- I came to sell some stuff.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.800
Books. You know,
Carla's been wanting them.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.262
Why are you selling those books?

27:17.470 --> 27:20.849
- I need some cash.
- You cut up your credit cards.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.226
- Why would you do that?
- Is that my quesadilla?

27:23.435 --> 27:26.354
Yes. Sorry. Here you go.

27:26.563 --> 27:29.441
- So you want to buy them or not?
- I don't know. I'm thinking.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.985
- Do you have Tabasco?
- No, I have Tapatio.

27:32.193 --> 27:36.489
- Fine. Anything is fine.
- You said you wanted to buy them.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.825
- I'm thinking.
- Hey, um...

27:40.869 --> 27:43.330
- Is this your granddaughter?
- Yeah, sure.

27:43.538 --> 27:45.123
Sage, this is Olivia.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.461
- Oh, hi.
- I've seen pictures of you.

27:49.669 --> 27:50.879
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:51.671 --> 27:54.966
Kind of a surprise meeting you here,
today, like this...

27:55.175 --> 27:58.094
...but, okay. Yeah.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.473
Fuck.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.183
Carla?

28:04.476 --> 28:07.312
- So, what do you say?
- Well... Hm.

28:08.772 --> 28:11.524
I'll give you...

28:12.442 --> 28:14.527
...$60 for them.

28:14.986 --> 28:17.280
- For all of them? Sixty?
- Mm-hm.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.935
- Do you need money?
- I don't need money from you. Thanks.

28:21.076 --> 28:24.704
- Because if you do...
- Are you fucking kidding me, Olivia?

28:25.705 --> 28:27.207
- Those are worth more than $60.
- Oh.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.501
- I can do my own haggling.
- Really?

28:29.709 --> 28:31.429
- Are you sure?
- Stop trying to be so nice.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.464
Stop trying to be so mean.
Stop being such a mean asshole!

28:34.672 --> 28:37.509
Me? Mean? I'm not mean.
At least I'm not a hypocrite.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.386
- Now I'm a hypocrite.
- Yes, indeed.

28:39.594 --> 28:42.972
Did you call me earlier?
Did you call me and hang up twice?

28:43.181 --> 28:44.474
Yes.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.935
- And you know why?
- I don't know.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.395
- I don't know why.
- Because you just want power.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.688
You wanna exert your dominance
over me.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.565
You want to be the alpha Bonobo.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.692
- No.
- Okay, just take it outside.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.528
Could I get that hot sauce, please?

28:56.736 --> 28:58.905
And why don't you pay a decent wage,
you cheap asshole.

28:59.114 --> 29:01.282
- What did you call me?
- You heard what I said.

29:01.491 --> 29:02.742
You are not a feminist.

29:02.951 --> 29:04.494
It should be illegal,
what you pay these kids.

29:04.702 --> 29:06.663
- I'm not a kid.
- It probably is illegal.

29:06.871 --> 29:09.416
You know, you're not a Bonobo, Carla.
You're a gorilla.

29:09.624 --> 29:12.544
You are a silverback male gorilla.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.922
- Okay, you know what, Grandma...
- Don't you fucking call me Grandma!

29:16.131 --> 29:18.716
- What am I supposed to call you?
- What's wrong with you?

29:18.925 --> 29:20.260
Take your head out of your ass.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.637
For God's sake,
go back and get your doctorate.

29:22.846 --> 29:24.180
Stop working in this dump.

29:24.389 --> 29:26.349
Fuck it. Okay, shit. Fuck.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.101
- That's it. Here.
- Okay.

29:28.309 --> 29:31.646
You take your stained books
and get out of my café.

29:31.855 --> 29:34.691
- I don't want them.
- Fuck you! I don't want you to have them.

29:34.899 --> 29:36.860
Take your 60 bucks,
shove it up your ass!

29:37.068 --> 29:38.695
Could I just have the hot sauce?

29:42.574 --> 29:46.703
Give me that sack.
Give me that goddamned sack!

29:47.162 --> 29:50.498
Why are you acting like the last
four months didn't mean anything?

29:50.707 --> 29:52.750
- Because they didn't.
- I hate you!

29:52.959 --> 29:55.503
- Oh, that's great!
- I wish I'd never met you!

29:55.712 --> 29:57.213
- You never did!
- Oh, why?

29:57.422 --> 29:59.591
You never let me see the real you.
Is that why?

29:59.799 --> 30:01.801
- That is exactly right.
- Bullshit!

30:02.010 --> 30:05.138
I saw the real you.
I saw it, you selfish asshole!

30:05.346 --> 30:08.183
- And I still stuck around!
- And your medal's in the mail.

30:08.391 --> 30:11.895
- Well, I'm returning it!
- You neophyte! You ingénue!

30:12.103 --> 30:15.356
Solipsist! Writer-in-residence!

30:15.565 --> 30:17.692
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Okay. Nice to meet you. Bye.

30:29.704 --> 30:30.914
Goddamn it!

30:32.081 --> 30:34.334
- You sure you're okay to drive?
- Oh, I'm fine.

30:34.542 --> 30:38.463
And, baby, you can call me Grandma.
That was just me flipping out.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.298
I know.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.844
Why'd she call you
"writer-in-residence"?

30:45.053 --> 30:47.814
She's calling me a sellout because
that's how I used to make a living.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.183
You go someplace,
a private college, usually...

30:50.391 --> 30:52.393
...because that's where they have
the money.

30:52.602 --> 30:54.687
You do a few readings,
teach a few seminars...

30:54.896 --> 30:56.816
...then you leave,
because you don't have tenure.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.441
But how is that selling out?

30:58.650 --> 31:01.986
Oh, because I wasn't suffering for my art.
But I had a kid.

31:02.195 --> 31:06.157
I used to take your mom along with me
when she was little.

31:06.366 --> 31:08.701
A lot of time in cars we spent,
your mother and I.

31:09.577 --> 31:12.163
Well, at least I'm learning
some new insults.

31:12.372 --> 31:15.625
My friends just pretty much call
each other "bitch", "ho" and "slut."

31:15.833 --> 31:18.253
Oh, you know,
that's such ignorant bullshit.

31:18.461 --> 31:20.171
Who are these friends of yours?

31:23.466 --> 31:27.136
Do you think I'm one?
Like, do you think I'm a slut?

31:27.345 --> 31:29.222
No. No.

31:29.430 --> 31:32.684
And I don't want you
using that word again.

31:38.439 --> 31:42.986
- What's that sound?
- Oh, that's how the car sounds.

31:45.071 --> 31:48.157
Maybe we should stop
and get a few dollars' worth of gas.

32:02.755 --> 32:06.634
- She's pretty. Olivia.
- Oh, she's pretty.

32:06.843 --> 32:09.304
That's what "Olivia" means.
"Most beautiful."

32:09.512 --> 32:12.432
- So, what's she doing with me? Right?
- No.

32:12.640 --> 32:17.353
- That's what you were thinking.
- No, it wasn't, actually.

32:20.857 --> 32:22.442
She wouldn't leave me alone.

32:22.650 --> 32:25.486
I tell you, she sent me an essay
she'd written about my work.

32:25.695 --> 32:27.905
Asked if I'd meet for coffee.

32:28.906 --> 32:31.909
I was so damn vain I said okay,
and then we did.

32:32.118 --> 32:35.204
And, oh, she was cute.
And so damn smart.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.665
That's the real aphrodisiac.

32:37.874 --> 32:43.254
I've written more in the last four months
than I wrote in the five years before that.

32:45.256 --> 32:49.302
That's what good sex will do for you.
Anyway, that's over.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.012
So how do I look?

32:51.220 --> 32:53.514
What about the side from here,
how does that look?

32:53.723 --> 32:56.809
- What?
- Never mind.

32:58.144 --> 33:01.856
- Grandma, do you have any more ideas?
- Yeah.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.734
Afraid I do.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.410
- What?
- No. Nothing.

33:56.119 --> 33:59.580
Wait in the car.
On second thought, come with me.

34:04.377 --> 34:07.630
- Hi. Hi, Karl.
- Elle.

34:11.551 --> 34:14.762
- What a surprise to get your call.
- Well, it's been too long.

34:14.971 --> 34:16.472
Thirty years, Elle.

34:16.681 --> 34:19.350
It's been 30 years
since we saw each other.

34:20.810 --> 34:22.978
- We're 30 years older.
- That's the way it works.

34:23.187 --> 34:25.022
It don't go backwards.

34:25.231 --> 34:28.275
- Who's the young lady?
- This is my granddaughter, Sage.

34:28.484 --> 34:33.156
- Hi.
- "Sage." Nice name. Pungent.

34:33.364 --> 34:38.202
- Want some zucchini?
- Oh, that's okay. No.

34:38.411 --> 34:41.121
- Do you?
- No. No, thank you. I'm fine.

34:41.330 --> 34:44.375
How about some corn?
I just boiled some corn.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.462
- Corn. Okay.
- Come on.

34:51.424 --> 34:54.177
- Sage, you sure you don't want a piece?
- Oh, no, thank you.

34:54.385 --> 34:57.138
I have a bit of an upset stomach. So...

34:57.346 --> 35:01.267
- Listen, who are these people?
- My grandkids.

35:01.476 --> 35:02.810
So you've got grandkids now?

35:03.019 --> 35:06.355
I do. You're not the only one
allowed to have grandkids.

35:06.564 --> 35:09.859
- Which wife is this?
- Wife number four.

35:10.067 --> 35:14.071
Kid number five.
Grandkids 9, 10 and 11.

35:14.280 --> 35:19.869
- Jesus, you're a patriarch.
- I am. I'm biblical.

35:20.828 --> 35:24.290
- How's the corn?
- Oh, it is good.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.179
Those your own teeth
you're eating it with?

35:26.334 --> 35:28.711
- Need you ask?
- You always worried about your teeth.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.589
- You took good care of them.
- Yeah. She used to tell me...

35:31.798 --> 35:34.217
- ...brush your teeth or you'll lose them.
- Did she?

35:35.176 --> 35:37.929
You know, the teeth are the only thing
we see on a person...

35:38.137 --> 35:40.389
...that'll still look the same
when they're dead.

35:40.598 --> 35:43.643
When somebody smiles at you,
they're showing you their skeleton.

35:43.851 --> 35:46.312
- That's creepy.
- Heh. It is.

35:46.521 --> 35:50.107
- So are you married now?
- Right now, no.

35:50.316 --> 35:53.486
I am currently a man about town.

35:54.070 --> 35:59.200
Sage, let me talk to Karl for a minute.
Why don't you go outside, look around?

35:59.450 --> 36:00.660
Okay.

36:06.123 --> 36:08.000
You gonna make me
a marriage proposal?

36:08.209 --> 36:11.212
- Now that you know I'm available?
- Afraid not.

36:11.420 --> 36:14.757
Just wondering if a wife
was gonna pop out from somewhere.

36:14.966 --> 36:16.926
God forbid.

36:17.134 --> 36:18.344
You wanna smoke some weed?

36:23.349 --> 36:24.559
Sure. Why not?

36:27.728 --> 36:28.771
Whoa.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.691
You mean business.

36:47.248 --> 36:50.209
Didn't think I'd be having a party today.

36:50.418 --> 36:52.920
- Care for a beer?
- Yeah.

36:58.384 --> 37:01.095
So how's your partner? Daisy?

37:01.304 --> 37:02.763
Ugh, come on.

37:03.222 --> 37:05.558
- Violet.
- Violet.

37:05.766 --> 37:08.019
- How's Violet?
- She passed away.

37:09.520 --> 37:13.941
A year and a half ago. Violet's dead.

37:14.609 --> 37:18.487
- I'm sorry. I am.
- Thanks.

37:18.905 --> 37:22.575
So listen, you told me...

37:22.783 --> 37:25.494
...that if I ever needed anything
I should come to you.

37:25.703 --> 37:27.371
Did I?

37:28.539 --> 37:30.875
Yes, I guess I did.

37:31.542 --> 37:33.085
About a hundred years ago.

37:33.294 --> 37:36.964
Well, I need $500. Here.

37:39.008 --> 37:41.552
I can pay you back
in a couple of weeks.

37:42.678 --> 37:45.389
So you're not here just to smoke a joint
with an old flame?

37:45.598 --> 37:50.436
Well, sure, I'm here for that.
But I need 500 bucks.

37:50.645 --> 37:53.356
- You must not have a lot of friends.
- Heh, heh.

37:53.564 --> 37:56.150
- Current ones.
- Guess not.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.988
You were always good with money,
I thought maybe you could help me out.

38:01.197 --> 38:02.615
What do you need it for?

38:05.117 --> 38:07.745
- Rent.
- For rent?

38:08.496 --> 38:09.538
Yeah.

38:09.747 --> 38:14.543
- Why don't you ask your daughter?
- Well, we're not speaking that often.

38:14.752 --> 38:16.337
That's too bad.

38:20.675 --> 38:23.052
It's painful seeing you, Elle.

38:24.929 --> 38:27.515
What the hell kind of a thing
is that to say to a woman?

38:27.723 --> 38:30.393
I don't know.
It just popped into my head.

38:30.601 --> 38:34.855
Maybe I'm getting soft.
Male menopause, maybe.

38:35.064 --> 38:37.858
You're well past menopause.
We both are.

38:38.067 --> 38:42.029
It's painful seeing you,
because it makes me feel old.

38:42.238 --> 38:43.280
Oh.

38:43.447 --> 38:49.704
- I like being old. Young people are stupid.
- We sure were. We sure were stupid.

38:51.288 --> 38:55.751
- So can you loan me the money?
- Sure.

38:56.210 --> 39:00.214
- I want something in return, though.
- What? What do you want?

39:01.257 --> 39:02.299
A kiss.

39:05.720 --> 39:10.641
- You mean like a peck?
- No, like a kiss. A real kiss.

39:12.018 --> 39:15.312
- And then you'll loan me the money?
- Yeah.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.273
Okay. Uh-huh.

39:17.481 --> 39:19.650
Let's get it over with.

39:53.059 --> 39:55.394
There you go. For old times' sake.

39:55.603 --> 39:58.022
Now I want you to make love to me.

39:58.355 --> 40:01.358
Just once. For old times' sake.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.570
Go fuck yourself, Karl.

40:04.779 --> 40:07.615
I'm not really interested
in fucking myself, Elle.

40:07.823 --> 40:11.702
I wish I was. I could've saved myself
a lot of trouble over the years.

40:12.453 --> 40:17.124
So look, I'm gonna go outside
and work on my jeep.

40:17.541 --> 40:21.087
We had a deal.
Hey, Karl, we had a deal.

40:22.379 --> 40:23.631
Asshole.

40:26.133 --> 40:28.052
Goddamn it, we had a deal!

40:28.260 --> 40:30.304
- Why are you here?
- I told you.

40:30.513 --> 40:32.848
I'm here because I need some money.

40:33.057 --> 40:34.100
You wronged me.

40:34.308 --> 40:37.186
- Oh, this again?
- You were wrong, how you acted.

40:37.394 --> 40:41.107
- Forty-nine years ago?
- Forty-nine years ago. You were wrong.

40:41.315 --> 40:45.194
Well, I was wrong to be sleeping
with you, given I was a lesbian.

40:45.402 --> 40:48.447
Well, you didn't seem like a lesbian
at the time.

40:48.656 --> 40:51.367
- When we were living on the boat.
- Yeah, well, I was.

40:51.575 --> 40:53.035
Just a confused one.

40:53.244 --> 40:56.247
And that poem you wrote?
"The Ogre's Seed"?

40:56.455 --> 40:59.542
That was not about you, Karl. Karl.

41:04.797 --> 41:07.174
Are you're sure you're not here
to say you're sorry?

41:08.592 --> 41:12.221
To apologize to me? Finally?

41:13.013 --> 41:17.601
You've got 11 grandkids.
And you can't let go of old shit?

41:18.727 --> 41:25.484
I find that as I grow older,
old shit just bubbles up.

41:26.402 --> 41:29.363
It bubbles up out of the tar.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.699
Don't you find that to be the case?

41:34.743 --> 41:36.537
Look, Elle...

41:38.164 --> 41:42.126
...I'm not the one
who phoned up out of nowhere.

41:42.334 --> 41:46.255
You're the one rattling the skeletons here.
So, what are you here for?

41:46.463 --> 41:48.757
What are you here for?

41:48.966 --> 41:52.261
I'm here because
I need some goddamn money...

41:52.469 --> 41:57.474
...and I'm the only idiot in the world I know
who would cut up her credit cards...

41:57.683 --> 41:59.685
...to prove a point to herself.

42:00.186 --> 42:01.812
Sage!

42:02.313 --> 42:04.565
Goddamn it, I knew I was stupid
to come here.

42:04.773 --> 42:08.360
You are the same old selfish bastard
you always were.

42:08.569 --> 42:11.864
Sage! Come on, let's go.

42:12.573 --> 42:14.867
Wait a minute. Wait.

42:17.661 --> 42:18.996
Okay.

42:19.747 --> 42:20.873
Okay. I can help.

42:21.081 --> 42:22.541
You can?

42:23.250 --> 42:27.755
If you need my help, I can help you.
For old times' sake.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.967
- Five hundred?
- Yeah.

42:32.176 --> 42:34.011
I have it. Hold on.

42:40.351 --> 42:43.103
- He's not my...
- Your grandfather? No.

42:43.312 --> 42:45.898
Your grandfather was a fling.
Just a one-night stand.

42:46.106 --> 42:49.485
I don't even know where he is.
Karl's a guy I married.

42:50.319 --> 42:52.571
- What?
- We lived on a sailboat...

42:52.780 --> 42:55.115
...for a couple of months, and then...

42:55.407 --> 42:58.619
I split. In the middle of the night.

43:02.414 --> 43:05.042
Wait. Was this before
Grandma Vi or...?

43:05.251 --> 43:07.294
Of course it was before Grandma Vi.

43:07.503 --> 43:08.921
Hey...

43:10.464 --> 43:13.926
So, what's it for?
What's the money really for?

43:14.134 --> 43:15.594
I told you, it's for rent.

43:15.803 --> 43:18.138
Yeah, you told me that,
but you're a shitty liar.

43:19.765 --> 43:21.475
So, what's it for?

43:22.601 --> 43:25.604
- Um, I...
- She needs to terminate a pregnancy...

43:25.813 --> 43:27.356
...and she's gonna have an abortion.

43:29.149 --> 43:30.442
No.

43:31.485 --> 43:33.362
- No fucking way.
- Karl...

43:33.570 --> 43:37.866
Are you out of your mind?
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

43:38.075 --> 43:40.911
- Come on, Karl.
- Go to hell.

43:41.120 --> 43:42.997
All right! All right!

43:44.748 --> 43:47.835
I'm sorry! All right?

43:48.419 --> 43:51.046
I'm not sorry that I did it. But...

43:51.714 --> 43:53.716
I am sorry that I lied to you.

43:54.300 --> 43:58.012
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you.

43:59.263 --> 44:01.849
That's all I'm sorry for.

44:02.308 --> 44:06.895
- But, Karl, I am sorry for that.
- It was my decision too.

44:07.104 --> 44:10.607
It's my body. It's always been my body.

44:10.816 --> 44:15.779
And then you go... You fucking go
and have a stranger's baby?

44:16.697 --> 44:19.199
I wanted a baby.

44:19.616 --> 44:22.828
- I just didn't want a husband.
- Yeah.

44:23.037 --> 44:26.290
- So she grew up without a father.
- Oh, she grew up fine.

44:26.498 --> 44:29.084
Which is why you two don't speak.

44:32.254 --> 44:33.672
And you.

44:38.135 --> 44:40.637
Does he know? The father?

44:41.638 --> 44:45.392
Yeah, he knows. But he doesn't care.
He doesn't want it.

44:46.143 --> 44:49.438
Well, at least he knows.

44:50.147 --> 44:53.859
At least you had the human decency
to tell him.

44:55.235 --> 44:56.862
But I'm not gonna pay for it.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.949
I can't pay for that.

45:15.756 --> 45:16.924
Come on. Let's go.

45:17.132 --> 45:21.428
- So you had an abortion?
- In someone's basement. Yeah.

45:22.513 --> 45:24.932
- Was it a doctor?
- He said he went to medical school.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.308
But I doubt it.

45:27.309 --> 45:28.352
Did it hurt?

45:34.942 --> 45:37.820
- So you used to like men?
- I always liked women.

45:38.028 --> 45:39.321
I just didn't like myself.

45:42.825 --> 45:44.785
- I don't know.
- What? You don't know what?

45:46.537 --> 45:48.080
Are you having second thoughts?

45:56.213 --> 45:57.798
I just...

45:59.174 --> 46:03.345
You know, I wanna have a family.
And I wanna have babies someday.

46:03.554 --> 46:06.723
But not now. You know?

46:07.391 --> 46:12.187
And I want to go to college.
And I got my GPA up to a B.

46:13.313 --> 46:16.859
And some people can do both.
But I can't.

46:20.154 --> 46:22.948
You know what we have to do, right?

46:26.034 --> 46:27.703
Yeah.

47:00.777 --> 47:03.280
- I'm scared.
- You and me both.

47:03.489 --> 47:04.531
You're scared?

47:04.740 --> 47:08.243
I've been scared of your mom
since she was 5 years old.

47:08.452 --> 47:10.370
Over here. Come on.

47:31.350 --> 47:33.602
You must be Elle. I'm Ian.

47:33.810 --> 47:35.979
- Hi, Sage.
- Hi.

47:36.188 --> 47:38.106
You guys, follow me.

47:40.192 --> 47:43.570
Ahem. What happened
to what's-her-name? You know, Tiffany?

47:43.779 --> 47:46.114
- I don't know a Tiffany. I replaced Sasha.
- Ah.

47:46.323 --> 47:48.492
Boy, she goes through secretaries,
doesn't she?

47:48.700 --> 47:51.453
You must feel like your head's
on the chopping block.

47:52.037 --> 47:55.499
- So nice to finally meet you.
- Hey, come on. Let's go.

47:58.418 --> 47:59.586
Mm.

47:59.795 --> 48:02.047
Come in. Come in. Come in.

48:02.256 --> 48:04.049
Hey, there she is.

48:05.801 --> 48:09.763
- What is that thing you're standing on?
- It's a treadmill desk.

48:09.972 --> 48:11.765
That's a redundancy.

48:14.017 --> 48:15.978
- And that was a joke.
- That's debatable.

48:16.186 --> 48:18.564
So, what's going on?

48:18.939 --> 48:22.484
- Um, so...
- Come on. What is going on here?

48:22.693 --> 48:24.611
- Spit it out.
- Hey, come on. Not so bossy.

48:24.820 --> 48:26.238
Why are you so bossy?

48:26.446 --> 48:28.282
You know what,
you're making me anxious.

48:28.490 --> 48:30.534
The two of you are making me
extremely anxious.

48:30.742 --> 48:33.370
Showing up like this, here.
In the middle of the day?

48:33.912 --> 48:35.831
What's going on?
Why aren't you in school?

48:36.039 --> 48:39.876
- Because I'm on break.
- Right.

48:40.085 --> 48:42.796
- Are you pregnant?
- What?

48:43.505 --> 48:47.301
Please don't tell me
that you are fucking pregnant.

48:47.509 --> 48:48.719
Oh, my God.

48:50.971 --> 48:53.682
- She's pregnant.
- Goddamn it!

48:53.890 --> 48:56.602
Goddamn it!

48:57.477 --> 49:01.106
I should fucking... You asshole!
I should fucking kill you, you know that?

49:03.233 --> 49:05.736
What happened to the box of condoms
that I bought you? Huh?

49:05.944 --> 49:09.948
Did you eat them? There were
a hundred condoms in that box!

49:10.157 --> 49:11.992
- Your 4:30's here. Should I tell...
- What?

49:12.200 --> 49:16.038
Should I tell your 4:30 that you're busy?
I could tell them you're running behind...

49:16.246 --> 49:20.584
Tell them that I will see them
in the little conference room.

49:20.792 --> 49:25.213
Okay? And you two, don't go anywhere.
I'll be back in 15 minutes. Do not leave.

49:25.422 --> 49:26.965
Do not leave.

49:28.634 --> 49:31.511
All right, take the clients
to the little conference room...

49:31.720 --> 49:33.263
...and then get me an espresso.

49:33.472 --> 49:37.267
Hey, no. Wait, wait, wait!
Espresso first, then clients.

49:37.934 --> 49:38.977
Don't leave!

49:40.520 --> 49:43.148
Oh, my God!

49:47.527 --> 49:49.863
- Okay, we should go, like, now.
- Yeah.

49:50.072 --> 49:52.908
- Yeah, we better not.
- What?

49:57.412 --> 49:58.789
This sucks.

49:58.997 --> 50:02.292
Oh, boy, she does not need an espresso.

50:22.979 --> 50:24.398
Well...

50:25.357 --> 50:26.692
...this is my fault.

50:27.526 --> 50:29.986
- It's not.
- Yes, it is.

50:30.195 --> 50:33.073
Because you've been left alone,
unsupervised...

50:33.281 --> 50:35.534
...with way too much free time,
for far too long.

50:35.742 --> 50:38.829
- I don't need to be supervised.
- Clearly you do.

50:39.037 --> 50:42.374
I mean, any idiot could see that
you need to be supervised, am I right?

50:42.582 --> 50:46.712
- Are you saying I'm "any idiot"?
- What is your involvement?

50:46.920 --> 50:50.424
My involvement is I am her grandmother.
And I'm your mother.

50:50.632 --> 50:53.427
- Yes, but what are you doing here?
- I'm here for support.

50:53.635 --> 50:57.139
Did you let them use your house?
For sex?

50:57.806 --> 50:59.057
I'm not a pimp.

50:59.641 --> 51:02.894
- Okay, how far along are you?
- Ten weeks.

51:03.103 --> 51:05.480
Oh, thank God. The first trimester.

51:05.689 --> 51:09.693
So I'm assuming that you want...

51:10.986 --> 51:14.114
- ...to have an abortion.
- Yes.

51:16.825 --> 51:17.951
Okay.

51:21.163 --> 51:25.250
- Who is it? The little creep?
- Yes. Yes.

51:25.417 --> 51:26.668
Really? Sage!

51:26.877 --> 51:29.838
You know what,
but we're not a couple anymore.

51:30.046 --> 51:35.135
- If we ever really were one.
- I told you he was a loser.

51:35.343 --> 51:39.848
- Did I not tell you he was a flat-out loser?
- Yes, you told me, okay?

51:40.056 --> 51:42.184
- And you were right.
- I was right.

51:42.642 --> 51:45.312
- Yes.
- Okay, so you don't have any money.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.856
You spent all your money on shoes
and garbage.

51:48.064 --> 51:51.943
Okay, but you confiscated my credit card,
which was totally unfair.

51:52.152 --> 51:54.738
It cost me $2000
to have the garage door fixed.

51:54.946 --> 51:57.657
Brake. Gas. Brake. Gas.

51:59.493 --> 52:02.454
So I'm assuming that
you then went to her for money...

52:02.662 --> 52:07.751
...but she doesn't have any money either
so, of course, you came to me.

52:07.959 --> 52:09.544
Am I right?

52:09.753 --> 52:12.923
Well, you missed a few steps in between,
but you're right.

52:13.089 --> 52:14.299
Mm. Mm-hm.

52:14.716 --> 52:18.220
- What about all those condoms? Hm?
- We used them.

52:18.428 --> 52:20.138
- Oh, you and the rodent?
- Yes.

52:20.430 --> 52:24.434
Well, you know what? You can get more.
I didn't hand-make them. I didn't knit them.

52:24.643 --> 52:26.812
Okay, I know.
You don't have to yell at me.

52:27.020 --> 52:29.189
This isn't yelling.
I will show you yelling.

52:30.148 --> 52:32.526
Okay, we need to get you
an appointment at a clinic.

52:32.734 --> 52:35.779
No, no, no.
I already made an appointment. At 5:45.

52:35.987 --> 52:37.739
- Today?
- Yes.

52:37.948 --> 52:41.034
That's in an hour.
I can't take you at 5:45.

52:41.243 --> 52:43.620
I can take her. I can take her.
If you pay for it.

52:43.829 --> 52:45.997
- How much?
- We need $500.

52:46.957 --> 52:51.378
- Christ. You don't have $500?
- You know, at the moment I don't.

52:51.753 --> 52:54.881
And I misplaced my credit card.

52:55.090 --> 52:58.468
I suppose that makes me
some kind of sub-human.

52:58.677 --> 52:59.761
You said it, not me.

52:59.970 --> 53:02.764
You know, kid,
you need such a spanking.

53:02.973 --> 53:06.184
I'd like to see you try.
Come on. Let's go.

53:06.393 --> 53:08.436
Gotta get to an ATM.

53:11.648 --> 53:16.570
- You weren't going to tell me, were you?
- I don't know.

53:19.406 --> 53:21.157
Honestly, no. I wasn't.

53:21.366 --> 53:22.701
Why?

53:23.702 --> 53:24.828
I was scared.

53:25.036 --> 53:27.038
- Why?
- Because you're scary.

53:27.247 --> 53:30.584
- I'm scary? And she's not?
- I didn't come here to take crap from you.

53:30.792 --> 53:32.210
No, you came here for money.

53:32.752 --> 53:34.838
I haven't asked you
for anything in years.

53:35.046 --> 53:36.840
Well, hooray for you.

53:37.048 --> 53:40.176
There were things I wanted to pay for,
you know. Nurses.

53:40.677 --> 53:44.097
It wasn't my decision. It was hers.
You know how private she was.

53:44.306 --> 53:46.641
Really? And all along
I just thought it was you...

53:46.850 --> 53:48.435
...being too proud to accept help.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.190
I'm deeply disappointed in you.

53:54.399 --> 53:58.069
Deeply. You know that?
I had thought you were doing better.

53:58.278 --> 54:00.238
I thought you were becoming
responsible.

54:00.447 --> 54:03.325
- You know, people make mistakes.
- I'm aware of that.

54:03.533 --> 54:06.119
I make my living
cleaning up after people's mistakes.

54:06.328 --> 54:10.040
And they're not mistakes,
they're choices! Here.

54:11.875 --> 54:13.627
Call me when it's over.

54:15.253 --> 54:17.130
I have to go.

54:18.298 --> 54:21.259
- Were you going to tell me?
- It's not up to me.

54:21.468 --> 54:23.511
- It's up to her to tell you.
- You're awful.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.972
You are an awful mother.

54:26.723 --> 54:28.058
- I'm an awful mother?
- Yeah.

54:28.266 --> 54:30.644
Well, luckily for you
I wasn't your only mother.

54:30.852 --> 54:34.272
- No. Thank God. Thank God for Vi.
- Why don't you try being more like her?

54:35.190 --> 54:38.568
Anyway, I will try to be a better
grandmother.

54:39.319 --> 54:40.403
Come on.

54:46.493 --> 54:48.411
That went better than I thought it would.

54:48.620 --> 54:51.081
She's such a brat.
Damn it, she's spoiled.

54:51.289 --> 54:54.084
What a brat. Vi spoiled her, she did.

54:54.292 --> 54:56.920
Vi wanted to make
all the parenting decisions.

54:57.128 --> 55:00.006
People thought
I was the controlling one. Ha, ha.

55:00.882 --> 55:04.094
- We're not gonna make it on time.
- We're gonna make it, don't worry.

55:04.302 --> 55:07.138
If this rat bastard will move
the hell over!

55:07.347 --> 55:09.599
Dumb fuck, slow-ass motherfucker,
move!

55:09.808 --> 55:10.850
Calm down.

55:11.017 --> 55:13.770
What do you mean, calm down?
You wanna get there, don't you?

55:13.979 --> 55:16.356
- But just don't drive so fast.
- Come on, move it!

55:16.564 --> 55:21.027
- Stop yelling!
- I am not yelling! Did I yell? No!

55:21.736 --> 55:24.614
Jesus, come on, move it, you moron.
Move it!

55:24.823 --> 55:27.075
- Am I gonna go to hell?
- What?

55:27.283 --> 55:31.621
- Am I gonna go to hell? What if it's true?
- What are you talking about?

55:31.830 --> 55:35.125
Along with all the millions of other
women who've had abortions?

55:35.333 --> 55:38.795
- Yeah. Along with them.
- I don't believe in a vengeful God.

55:39.004 --> 55:41.756
When you're dead, you're dead.
It's blackness. End of story.

55:41.965 --> 55:43.675
Void. Get used to it.

55:45.218 --> 55:47.971
And don't cry. Don't beat yourself up.

55:48.179 --> 55:52.934
- Stop crying, you're so masochistic...
- I'm not crying right now!

55:53.143 --> 55:57.230
Come on, move it!
Come on, you moron! Move it!

55:59.607 --> 56:01.067
Don't worry, don't worry.

56:10.160 --> 56:12.579
- What's wrong with you?
- Just a minute.

56:12.787 --> 56:15.165
The car acts that way. Just a second.

56:15.707 --> 56:18.001
God, fuck!

56:23.715 --> 56:25.675
Oh, Jesus. God.

56:27.719 --> 56:29.387
Oh...

56:31.222 --> 56:33.141
I'm sorry.

56:33.349 --> 56:35.018
Excuse me?

56:36.102 --> 56:38.313
I said I'm sorry.

56:55.497 --> 56:56.998
Ah.

56:57.499 --> 57:00.001
- Good, good, good.
- Wait, wait, wait.

57:12.472 --> 57:15.225
- So where are you guys headed again?
- A medical facility.

57:15.433 --> 57:18.353
My granddaughter
is getting a procedure.

57:19.062 --> 57:20.563
It's gonna be okay, honey.

57:20.772 --> 57:23.149
- What kind of procedure?
- Female stuff.

57:23.358 --> 57:25.652
Oh, Jesus.
Don't worry, we'll get you there.

57:25.860 --> 57:27.403
Quiet! I can't hear the show!

57:27.612 --> 57:29.989
- Quiet? You be quiet!
- No, you be quiet!

57:30.198 --> 57:32.158
- You be quiet!
- You be quiet!

57:32.367 --> 57:34.536
Hey, enough out of all of you!

57:48.675 --> 57:52.137
- Hey, thanks. Thanks for the lift.
- Thank you.

57:52.971 --> 57:54.973
Uh-oh. Just keep walking.

57:59.477 --> 58:01.855
- Don't kill your baby.
- Just ignore her.

58:02.063 --> 58:05.483
- Your baby has fingernails.
- Not until 22 weeks, genius.

58:05.692 --> 58:07.402
Baby-killing slut!

58:07.610 --> 58:09.571
Is that how you talk in front
of that sweet little girl?

58:09.779 --> 58:11.990
If you go in there,
God will send you to hell!

58:12.198 --> 58:15.160
- Go on, sweetheart. I'll be right in.
- Wait. What? Grandma, no!

58:16.828 --> 58:18.830
Hi, sweetheart.

58:19.038 --> 58:21.124
You know, there's a larger world
out there...

58:21.332 --> 58:26.754
...that does not have to be filled
with hatred and narrow-mindedness.

58:27.380 --> 58:28.423
Oh, my God!

58:29.090 --> 58:33.219
Hi. She has a 5:45 appointment.
Sage Reed.

58:33.428 --> 58:34.470
We got delayed.

58:34.679 --> 58:37.098
Yeah. And my grandmother needs
to be looked at.

58:37.307 --> 58:38.683
- No.
- What happened to you?

58:38.892 --> 58:43.813
Listen, I got slugged by the bad seed.
It's nothing. I'm fine.

58:44.314 --> 58:47.275
Okay. The doctor will be with you.
You can be seated.

59:02.207 --> 59:03.291
Sage?

59:03.917 --> 59:05.126
- Yes?
- I'm Dr. Ng.

59:05.335 --> 59:08.296
I heard there was some drama outside.
Is your grandmother doing all right?

59:08.504 --> 59:11.299
Her grandmother's fine.
She's not unconscious or anything.

59:11.799 --> 59:13.927
Got it. I'd like to take a look at you.

59:14.135 --> 59:17.847
- The nurse already did.
- I know. I'd like to look at you as well.

59:18.056 --> 59:20.391
- Can I come?
- Sage, we're gonna have you talk...

59:20.600 --> 59:23.603
...to our counselor for a little bit,
just to go over everything.

59:23.811 --> 59:25.313
Can my grandmother come with me?

59:25.521 --> 59:28.441
It's private, just to make sure
you're fully comfortable...

59:28.650 --> 59:29.901
...and it's your decision.

59:30.109 --> 59:31.945
Whose decision would it be?

59:32.153 --> 59:34.781
It's just to ensure she's not feeling
any pressure...

59:34.989 --> 59:36.532
...or fear about the procedure.

59:36.741 --> 59:38.618
Tracy will take you
to our counselor...

59:38.826 --> 59:42.664
...who's very well-trained and sensitive
so you don't have to worry.

59:42.872 --> 59:44.958
I'm glad to hear it,
but I'm gonna be there...

59:45.166 --> 59:47.377
...because this is my granddaughter.

59:51.422 --> 59:53.841
It's okay. I'll be okay.

59:54.050 --> 59:56.344
Sage, I'll be here.

59:57.387 --> 01:00:01.099
I'm gonna be right here outside
and if you need anything...

01:00:01.307 --> 01:00:05.436
...or if anybody gives you any shit,
they have to deal with me.

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:08.898
I know.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:14.487
Sage, you want to follow me, please?

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.702
No one's gonna give her any shit.
Right this way.

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:24.831
You go ahead. I'll follow you.
I can handle myself.

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:29.711
You feeling any dizziness?

01:00:30.044 --> 01:00:34.632
I see a bright light in one eye,
now in the other.

01:00:34.841 --> 01:00:37.260
- Ha, ha. No dizziness?
- No.

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:38.553
- Nausea?
- No.

01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:42.390
I told you I'm fine.
Take care of my granddaughter.

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:45.018
- You take care of her.
- I will.

01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:46.561
You'd better.

01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:50.106
If you hurt her I will come looking
for you, and I'm not kidding.

01:00:50.315 --> 01:00:51.524
I'm not going to hurt her.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.277
You gonna do a D and C?

01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:56.904
We don't do curettage at this stage
of pregnancy.

01:00:57.113 --> 01:00:58.448
Not at this clinic.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:01.868
- What do you do?
- We do vacuum aspiration.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:03.953
It's less traumatic to the uterus.

01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:07.665
- Guess it's not the Dark Ages anymore.
- No.

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:14.714
- How much is it gonna hurt her?
- Mm. It'll be a bit uncomfortable.

01:01:14.922 --> 01:01:17.175
She might cramp a fair amount
afterwards.

01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:21.554
- But the procedure shouldn't hurt.
- Mine hurt. Mine did.

01:01:22.055 --> 01:01:24.682
- It was like a nightmare.
- Well, like you said...

01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:28.102
...this isn't the Dark Ages.
Not here at least.

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:33.107
Okay, I'm gonna take you
to the Well Woman waiting room.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.902
Catchy name.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:52.210
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.546
I cancelled a few things. Is she okay?

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:58.633
She went in about 20 minutes ago.

01:01:59.175 --> 01:02:01.719
- What happened to your eye?
- The usual.

01:02:01.928 --> 01:02:03.221
God.

01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:08.976
Do you want coffee?
I can go get us coffee.

01:02:09.185 --> 01:02:11.854
- Oh, I'm okay.
- Yeah. Right.

01:02:12.063 --> 01:02:15.233
I don't really need
any more caffeine either.

01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:22.281
How is she?

01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:25.785
- Scared?
- Sure. Yeah.

01:02:31.082 --> 01:02:34.502
Talk about a feeling
of total powerlessness.

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:38.798
Kids.

01:02:48.975 --> 01:02:51.519
I miss her. I miss Mama Vi.

01:02:52.979 --> 01:02:56.149
I wish she were here.
To talk to her about this.

01:02:56.357 --> 01:02:58.985
She'd have a thing or two to say.

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:06.325
- I'd like to ask her what I did wrong.
- Who said you did something wrong?

01:03:06.534 --> 01:03:09.412
- Well, we're here, aren't we?
- Better than if we weren't.

01:03:20.673 --> 01:03:23.259
Hi, sweetheart.

01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:25.386
Hi.

01:03:28.139 --> 01:03:32.477
- What are you doing here?
- I cancelled some stuff.

01:03:33.227 --> 01:03:35.480
Sage, I wanted to be here.
I just...

01:03:35.688 --> 01:03:37.231
You caught me by surprise.

01:03:37.899 --> 01:03:41.527
- Hey, how are you doing?
- She did great.

01:03:42.445 --> 01:03:43.696
We'll see you in two weeks.

01:03:43.905 --> 01:03:45.990
Remember to take your temperature
every day...

01:03:46.199 --> 01:03:47.950
...and call if it goes above 100.4.

01:03:48.159 --> 01:03:50.203
We've got a nurse available
24 hours a day...

01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:52.622
...in case there's anything
out of the ordinary.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.541
- So one of you is driving Sage home?
- I am. I'm her mother.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:04:00.213
Good. You can pull the car around.
Jill and Wendy are gone.

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:02.131
Oh.

01:04:04.884 --> 01:04:06.594
I don't want to know.

01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:15.186
Jill and Wendy...

01:04:15.561 --> 01:04:17.688
I wonder which one slugged me.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:21.484
I think it felt like a Wendy, you know?

01:04:21.943 --> 01:04:23.611
Oh, I'm cramping.

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:26.239
- Bad?
- Yeah.

01:04:26.447 --> 01:04:28.908
- They said it's normal.
- Yeah.

01:04:33.329 --> 01:04:38.376
- God, I feel like crying all the time.
- Go on. Go right on and cry.

01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:42.588
If you don't cry about this,
what the hell you gonna cry about?

01:04:51.097 --> 01:04:52.139
Oh, God.

01:04:55.017 --> 01:04:58.187
Okay, let's go.

01:04:58.521 --> 01:04:59.855
Let's get you home.

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:09.532
You were really mean to me earlier.

01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:14.954
- I know.
- I'm not trying to ruin your life.

01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:16.205
I know.

01:05:16.414 --> 01:05:19.875
You know, I'm not perfect.
We're not all perfect. You're not perfect.

01:05:20.084 --> 01:05:24.714
- I'm aware of that. I am very aware of that.
- So stop being such an asshole.

01:05:29.844 --> 01:05:31.596
I'll try.

01:05:32.513 --> 01:05:33.806
I will.

01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:37.310
And you stop seeing that little creep.

01:05:38.644 --> 01:05:41.147
Grandma beat the shit out of him.

01:05:43.858 --> 01:05:47.361
- What?
- I did. I did. She's not kidding.

01:05:48.237 --> 01:05:52.908
- I would have liked to have seen that.
- Probably not.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:11.927
- Do you need a ride?
- No, no. You take her home.

01:06:12.136 --> 01:06:14.347
She needs to get home.
I'm gonna call a cab.

01:06:14.555 --> 01:06:18.184
- I should probably thank you.
- Knock yourself out.

01:06:19.602 --> 01:06:21.604
She's right, you know.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.441
I'm angry. I am really angry.

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:28.152
I'm a big bully, and I don't know
where it comes from.

01:06:28.361 --> 01:06:29.570
You don't?

01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:34.950
Well, you gave me good teeth too.

01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:37.995
You better take care of them,
or you're gonna lose them.

01:06:39.955 --> 01:06:43.668
Listen, I'd like to come by,
check on her tomorrow.

01:06:43.876 --> 01:06:45.503
Come by.

01:06:46.087 --> 01:06:50.800
Stay for dinner, if you want.
I'll order pizza.

01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:53.135
Good enough.

01:06:58.474 --> 01:06:59.767
Hey.

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:02.103
Thank you.

01:07:50.985 --> 01:07:53.487
It's gonna be expensive
to replace the crankshaft.

01:07:53.696 --> 01:07:57.992
- You been putting oil in it regularly?
- You know. I... Ahem.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.244
You get that black eye checked out?

01:08:02.496 --> 01:08:05.124
What, did you bang your head
on the steering wheel?

01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:07.877
Yeah.

01:08:08.377 --> 01:08:09.920
Got anyone?

01:08:13.799 --> 01:08:15.801
- What?
- You got anyone to pick you up?

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:17.636
Um...

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:19.220
No.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.683
I'll call you a cab.

01:08:23.434 --> 01:08:24.977
Okay.

01:08:28.606 --> 01:08:30.274
Thanks.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.807
Oh, Violet...

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:11.649
Oh.

01:09:12.483 --> 01:09:14.944
God, you made me laugh.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.242
I know.

01:09:22.493 --> 01:09:24.118
Driver...

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:26.831
...I need to make a stop.

01:09:33.087 --> 01:09:35.756
- Wait for me here, please.
- You have to pay me now.

01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:37.841
Yeah, of course. But you'll wait for me.

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:39.801
- How long?
- Five minutes.

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:41.720
Yeah, okay. No problem.

01:10:01.574 --> 01:10:03.617
- Elle.
- Hi.

01:10:05.286 --> 01:10:08.455
- What happened to you?
- Nothing. Some little girl punched me.

01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:10.749
- What?
- It was a karma boomerang.

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:12.543
- Anyway, I'm fine.
- Come in.

01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:15.087
- No, no, no.
- Come in, I wanna get you some ice.

01:10:15.296 --> 01:10:17.840
- No. You have company.
- Come in. No, just come in.

01:10:18.924 --> 01:10:22.553
- Uh... I don't really, I don't...
- I...

01:10:24.179 --> 01:10:26.140
Oh, shit.

01:10:26.348 --> 01:10:28.392
- These are my parents.
- Yeah, Jesus...

01:10:28.601 --> 01:10:30.644
- Mike and Francesca.
- Hello.

01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:33.230
- Mom and Dad, this is Elle.
- How do you do?

01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:36.483
I'm a friend of your daughter.

01:10:36.692 --> 01:10:38.235
We've heard a lot about you.

01:10:38.444 --> 01:10:41.280
- I enjoy your poetry.
- Thank you.

01:10:41.488 --> 01:10:43.991
- I read it at college.
- Of course.

01:10:44.199 --> 01:10:48.120
- I was a Women's Studies major.
- Uh, congratulations to you.

01:10:48.329 --> 01:10:51.832
"Dragonfly" was one
of my favorite poems.

01:10:52.374 --> 01:10:55.377
<i>You bite my wings,
Attack me midflight</i>

01:10:55.586 --> 01:10:59.506
<i>Evolution's knife
Pressed to my throat</i>

01:10:59.715 --> 01:11:01.717
Yes, that is the one
that gets anthologized.

01:11:01.926 --> 01:11:04.094
Not my favorite, honestly,
on a technical level.

01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:06.221
How come you stopped writing?

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:09.266
People stopped reading.

01:11:09.475 --> 01:11:11.727
- Here, just...
- Oh, no, dear. Thank you very much.

01:11:11.936 --> 01:11:14.336
- I feel like it's swelling...
- I've had ice. I really have.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.108
And I think it's done what it can do.
I'm gonna give you your privacy.

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:21.028
I have a cab waiting outside.
It's so intrusive.

01:11:21.236 --> 01:11:23.072
I just came to give you these.

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:26.492
- They're first editions.
- I know what they are.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.243
Yeah, of course you do.

01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:33.290
Anyway, it's been a pleasure,
and I'll just say goodbye.

01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:36.001
It was a pleasure to meet you.

01:11:37.419 --> 01:11:38.462
I'll be right back.

01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:41.173
- Jesus...
- Don't!

01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:48.639
Elle.

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:52.059
- Yeah?
- Where are you going?

01:11:52.977 --> 01:11:54.353
Home.

01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:56.981
So you came for that?
Just to give me some books?

01:11:57.648 --> 01:11:59.191
No.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.819
No, that's not why I came.

01:12:05.197 --> 01:12:07.908
Of course it meant something to me.

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:11.328
I loved being in love with you.

01:12:12.997 --> 01:12:15.833
I never thought
I could feel that way again.

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:22.464
You know, you have a wonderful life
ahead of you.

01:12:22.798 --> 01:12:24.925
And that's all I want for you.

01:12:27.428 --> 01:12:29.847
I want you to have what I had.

01:12:33.267 --> 01:12:34.476
It's been a long day...

01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:38.647
...and I'd kind of like to get home
to do some writing.

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:42.401
And you should probably
go back in there...

01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:45.821
...and make sure your parents don't need
smelling salts or something.

01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:47.489
Okay?

01:13:04.173 --> 01:13:07.051
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Elle.

01:13:23.734 --> 01:13:26.028
