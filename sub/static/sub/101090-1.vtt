00:25.245 --> 00:27.448
I learned
early on in my career

00:27.480 --> 00:31.319
that a job well done has
three critical parts.

00:41.662 --> 00:43.232
- ID badge, please.
- Sure.

00:44.666 --> 00:45.834
It's here somewhere.

00:49.105 --> 00:50.406
Ah, there we go.

00:58.748 --> 01:00.750
First, the right crew.

01:01.584 --> 01:03.686
It takes more than one
flint to make a fire.

01:08.026 --> 01:08.859
Almost got it.

01:09.693 --> 01:11.129
I'm here for a private viewing.

01:14.531 --> 01:15.632
Yes, sir, down the hall.

01:15.866 --> 01:16.666
Thanks.

01:27.312 --> 01:29.847
Two... there's
how things are,

01:29.881 --> 01:31.550
and how things appear to be.

01:33.386 --> 01:35.554
Is it normal for museum
guards to have machine guns?

01:36.389 --> 01:38.058
They weren't there two days
ago when we did the recon.

01:39.059 --> 01:40.493
Alpha, what's the call?

01:43.730 --> 01:46.000
This feels off, but we've
got to stay the course.

01:47.834 --> 01:48.868
All right, which door is it?

01:48.902 --> 01:50.904
Third door on the left.

01:51.972 --> 01:53.174
Other left!

02:13.595 --> 02:14.430
Where is it?

02:15.630 --> 02:17.100
It's hanging on the wall right
when you walk in the room.

02:17.766 --> 02:19.269
I'm in the room, it's not here.

02:19.602 --> 02:21.338
What? You're in the room?

02:22.672 --> 02:23.606
What the hell?

02:32.950 --> 02:34.718
Shit!

02:35.453 --> 02:36.588
Abort, abort!

02:36.620 --> 02:38.123
We've been compromised, abort!

02:43.295 --> 02:47.199
Three, Plan A is
only as good as your Plan B.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.656
All right, uh... down the
stairs, out the back door.

03:27.675 --> 03:28.510
Hey!

03:33.016 --> 03:33.583
Oh, shit.

03:35.185 --> 03:37.187
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

04:03.881 --> 04:06.686
- What the hell happened?
- Our network was hacked.

04:06.718 --> 04:08.187
Think it was a setup?

04:08.221 --> 04:10.889
It felt off in there.

04:11.224 --> 04:12.024
There's how things are,

04:12.058 --> 04:13.659
and there's how
things appear to be.

04:14.327 --> 04:15.860
Trust your gut next time.

04:15.894 --> 04:18.130
Yeah, well, whatever went
wrong, we need to figure it out,

04:18.165 --> 04:19.466
but we have bigger
issues to deal with.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.000
We gotta get ahead of this mess.

04:21.401 --> 04:23.036
Yeah and off the streets.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.305
Iggy, take
us to Rumble's HQ.

04:25.572 --> 04:27.474
- You sure?
- We have no choice.

04:30.078 --> 04:30.911
Copy that.

04:58.508 --> 05:00.543
Darius Emanuel Grouch...

05:00.776 --> 05:01.777
The Third.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.880
better known as...

05:08.119 --> 05:09.786
The Rumble.

05:11.188 --> 05:12.789
I am very disappointed.

05:13.291 --> 05:14.292
The painting wasn't there,

05:14.791 --> 05:16.193
someone knew we were coming.

05:18.297 --> 05:21.733
Warhol, De Kooning, Pollock,

05:24.303 --> 05:25.304
bunch of bitches.

05:26.138 --> 05:27.339
How about I just
blow your brains out,

05:27.372 --> 05:28.973
I'll create my own damn Pollock!

05:33.479 --> 05:36.649
Now Asgar Jorn, the
"Disturbing Duckling."

05:37.150 --> 05:41.521
That's modern art, and
now I'm disturbed, Jack.

05:41.554 --> 05:42.990
You a gambling man, Jack?

05:43.257 --> 05:44.325
Not anymore.

05:45.159 --> 05:47.661
Once a gambling man,
always a gambling man.

05:48.228 --> 05:49.496
You bet everything you had.

05:49.829 --> 05:51.432
You had a 50-50 shot, Jack.

05:51.765 --> 05:52.832
Toss of a coin.

05:53.334 --> 05:55.637
One side, in a split second,

05:55.670 --> 05:57.339
you make enough money to retire.

05:57.938 --> 05:59.507
You, your crew,
your family...

05:59.774 --> 06:01.609
live the life
they always dreamed of.

06:02.410 --> 06:03.511
On the other side,

06:05.413 --> 06:08.250
you lose... everything.

06:08.850 --> 06:11.754
My, how everything can
change in just a second.

06:12.854 --> 06:16.425
You trusted your gut,
Jack, and it lied to ya.

06:16.692 --> 06:18.695
And I've paid
for it ever since.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.700
You owed a lot of money
to some very bad people.

06:24.434 --> 06:27.437
I'm not just a businessman,
I'm an opportunist.

06:28.538 --> 06:29.973
So I bought your debt.

06:34.379 --> 06:35.213
I own you.

06:36.214 --> 06:37.948
Now you're gonna have
to repay me that debt.

06:39.384 --> 06:40.884
Those people
would've killed ya.

06:41.452 --> 06:44.223
I saved you, resurrected
you from the ashes!

06:44.889 --> 06:46.358
Now, you have to be
able to trust those

06:46.392 --> 06:47.793
who work for you.

06:48.494 --> 06:49.795
Can I trust you, Jack?

06:50.229 --> 06:51.363
You know you don't
have to ask me that.

06:51.397 --> 06:52.897
Then where the hell
is my painting?

06:53.733 --> 06:55.034
If I had my damn painting,

06:55.068 --> 06:56.836
we wouldn't be having this
conversation, now would we?

06:57.404 --> 07:00.173
Since you didn't bring me
my $40-million painting,

07:02.008 --> 07:05.145
I'm gonna need you to pay
me back... with interest.

07:07.681 --> 07:08.915
Can we just get to the job?

07:11.018 --> 07:13.920
Good man, Jack, good man.

07:18.326 --> 07:21.596
There is a legend
in the underworld,

07:22.097 --> 07:23.598
for those in the know,

07:24.199 --> 07:25.434
it's the called the Money Plane.

07:28.270 --> 07:29.906
Some of the baddest mother
fuckers on the planet

07:29.938 --> 07:32.308
are on that plane,
all craving action,

07:32.341 --> 07:34.076
whatever you wanna wager on,

07:34.110 --> 07:35.511
the Money Plane has you covered.

07:35.545 --> 07:37.747
You wanna bet on a dude fucking
an alligator...

07:37.780 --> 07:39.315
Money Plane.

07:39.348 --> 07:40.583
Untouchable by any government,

07:40.616 --> 07:42.252
because the flight
always takes place

07:42.286 --> 07:44.021
in international airspace.

07:44.388 --> 07:46.590
Word is they have over a
billion in crypto onboard,

07:46.623 --> 07:48.225
and millions in cash.

07:49.026 --> 07:52.563
I want you and your crew
to take down the house.

07:53.964 --> 07:55.767
No, no, you got to
be kidding me, right?

07:55.800 --> 07:57.235
Do I look like I'm joking?

07:58.870 --> 08:00.605
Now I'm gonna be fronting
you the money for the buy in,

08:00.638 --> 08:02.707
and I'm arranging cover
stories for you and your crew

08:02.740 --> 08:04.275
to get on board undetected.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.345
This is bat-shit crazy, Darius.
We can't do it.

08:06.378 --> 08:09.981
No, what's crazy is I
don't have my painting,

08:10.916 --> 08:14.053
yet you're here talking
to me, still very alive.

08:16.755 --> 08:17.757
Look familiar?

08:25.732 --> 08:28.602
You're more valuable
to me alive, for now.

08:29.503 --> 08:31.339
That's the only reason, Jack.

08:31.672 --> 08:34.275
You don't bring me back what
I want from the Money Plane,

08:34.575 --> 08:36.510
and you won't have
anything to come back to.

08:37.778 --> 08:38.913
Do you understand me?

08:41.917 --> 08:43.418
I..If we pull this off, and...

08:43.452 --> 08:44.453
Uh...

08:45.187 --> 08:47.689
Not "If".
"When" you pull this off!

08:48.090 --> 08:49.591
When we pull it off,

08:50.526 --> 08:52.961
that's it, we're square.

08:53.696 --> 08:57.033
And not just me, but my
entire crew. We're done!

08:59.702 --> 09:01.871
Yeah, we're square.

09:03.873 --> 09:04.707
P-Roach.

09:06.310 --> 09:08.212
This bag has
everything you need.

09:09.813 --> 09:12.683
All the details, the money
I'm fronting you, everything.

09:12.716 --> 09:14.818
And - as a little
incentive to you,

09:15.452 --> 09:17.789
You and your crew can keep
whatever's left in the vault.

09:23.395 --> 09:25.630
Now go get me my money, Jack.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.008
Have a safe flight.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.435
This is the
last one, I promise.

11:02.669 --> 11:05.506
Hey, what happened
to the last, last one?

11:06.674 --> 11:08.375
Well, we didn't complete
the job, did we?

11:08.409 --> 11:10.444
It's not our fault the
painting wasn't there!

11:10.778 --> 11:13.347
Hey, let's stay focused.

11:14.181 --> 11:15.182
What's the job?

11:16.417 --> 11:20.321
We are going to rob
the Money Plane.

11:20.355 --> 11:21.656
It's an airborne casino,

11:21.690 --> 11:23.391
chartered by a bunch
of elite criminals,

11:23.425 --> 11:25.760
who bet on all
kinds of crazy shit.

11:25.794 --> 11:27.829
It operates over
international airspace,

11:27.862 --> 11:32.868
but, apparently, it has
$1-billion in cryptocurrency.

11:34.037 --> 11:35.038
- And we're gonna steal it?
- Yeah.

11:36.372 --> 11:37.206
It's insane!

11:38.141 --> 11:39.508
Yeah.

11:39.542 --> 11:41.111
I love it!

11:41.144 --> 11:43.081
And how do we do this?

11:43.114 --> 11:46.283
I'm going to take on the
persona of a Mr. Phillip Monroe,

11:46.316 --> 11:47.751
he's an infamous
human trafficker,

11:47.784 --> 11:49.187
but he did all of his
business digitally,

11:49.219 --> 11:50.854
so nobody knows
what he looks like.

11:50.887 --> 11:53.191
Well, what happened
to the real Monroe?

11:53.223 --> 11:55.293
It seems Isabella had a
run in with Mr. Monroe

11:55.326 --> 11:57.361
last June in Moscow.

12:02.734 --> 12:03.935
Oh.

12:03.968 --> 12:05.104
Now Trey, I need you
to go undercover,

12:05.137 --> 12:07.140
you're gonna be my
right hand on the plane.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.143
Copy that.

12:10.176 --> 12:11.777
Isabella, you're
gonna be on board as well

12:11.810 --> 12:13.046
posing as a flight attendant,

12:13.079 --> 12:15.481
I got your cleared
credentials already.

12:15.514 --> 12:16.615
What about me, Jack?

12:16.648 --> 12:18.152
What do I do, who am I?

12:18.185 --> 12:20.820
You, Iggy, you're gonna be
my main man on the ground.

12:22.689 --> 12:24.390
You're gonna be managing
all the hardware,

12:24.424 --> 12:26.259
and basically
controlling everything.

12:27.761 --> 12:29.230
What, tech support?

12:29.262 --> 12:30.798
That's Trey's job!

12:30.831 --> 12:32.933
I know, but I need
Trey on board with me.

12:34.435 --> 12:35.836
Now, there's
no security cameras

12:35.870 --> 12:37.139
actually on the plane,

12:37.172 --> 12:38.873
so we're gonna use
that to our advantage.

12:39.707 --> 12:41.510
Once on the plane, we
create a diversion,

12:41.543 --> 12:44.180
so I can sneak off, and
take control of the cockpit.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.587
Trey will represent me,

12:52.621 --> 12:54.158
while Isabella
searches for the vault,

12:54.191 --> 12:55.125
and the server room.

12:55.159 --> 12:57.027
Once located, Isabella
will open the vault.

12:59.562 --> 13:01.931
Trey will sneak in the server
room, and hack the server.

13:01.964 --> 13:03.267
From there, you're
gonna transmit the key

13:03.299 --> 13:04.767
for the house crypto wallet,

13:04.801 --> 13:07.738
and create an untraceable
relay to our main man, Iggy.

13:11.809 --> 13:14.912
Ground support, what a shit job.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.316
Iggy, you're gonna be
awaiting my signal.

13:18.716 --> 13:20.451
Once we're in range, you're
gonna be on the receiving end

13:20.485 --> 13:22.787
of over a $1-billion
in cryptocurrency.

13:22.821 --> 13:23.822
Can you handle that?

13:25.224 --> 13:26.324
Yeah, I got it covered.

13:26.825 --> 13:27.892
Once you've given us the signal

13:27.926 --> 13:29.094
that you've received
the transfer,

13:29.829 --> 13:31.797
then the three of us will
go down to the cargo hold

13:31.831 --> 13:33.332
where we will parachute out,

13:33.499 --> 13:35.501
with all of the money
we took from the vault.

13:35.835 --> 13:37.937
We'll be gone before
anybody knows what happened.

13:39.004 --> 13:40.406
Memorize your files.

13:40.439 --> 13:42.176
Short prep time on this job.

13:43.443 --> 13:44.678
Get a good night's rest.

13:46.580 --> 13:49.416
If we do this right, we can
take care of our families,

13:49.683 --> 13:51.418
and move wherever
the hell we want.

13:52.352 --> 13:55.023
We depart day after
tomorrow, 0500.

14:10.039 --> 14:11.006
Oh!

14:11.040 --> 14:13.475
Ooh. Direct shot.
Oh!!!

14:13.876 --> 14:14.943
I don't fight fair!

14:16.378 --> 14:17.847
I quit your
team, and start my own!

14:17.881 --> 14:20.284
That's not fair, I'm
gonna hit you good.

14:21.218 --> 14:23.620
- There, I got one in.
- I have a shield.

14:23.653 --> 14:26.923
All right you two!
It's bedtime.

14:26.956 --> 14:28.791
Come on Mom, already?

14:28.825 --> 14:30.561
Yes honey, you got to go to bed.

14:30.895 --> 14:33.031
Yeah, it's bedtime
sweetie, go get washed up.

14:33.064 --> 14:34.431
I'll be up for a
story soon, okay?

14:34.465 --> 14:37.235
- But Dad, just five more...
- No buts.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.382
I can't believe you have to
leave on such short notice.

14:49.414 --> 14:51.917
I know, no one's more
upset about it than I am.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.588
Dad, I'm waiting!

14:55.821 --> 14:57.124
All right dad,

14:57.157 --> 14:59.126
it's story time.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.261
- We'll pick this up later.
- Yeah we will.

15:04.764 --> 15:06.767
And all was well in
Sherwood Village.

15:07.268 --> 15:08.102
For now.

15:09.937 --> 15:12.340
So, it's okay to steal

15:13.107 --> 15:15.109
if it's someone bad?

15:17.445 --> 15:19.781
Well, I mean they would
have to be really bad.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.985
So, I can steal all
of Harriet's candy,

15:24.018 --> 15:25.653
because she is mean to everyone?

15:25.687 --> 15:29.091
I'm sure that
Harriet is a tyrant,

15:29.124 --> 15:31.161
but if you stole and
ate all the candy,

15:31.194 --> 15:32.461
well, then you'd get sick,

15:32.728 --> 15:34.630
so wouldn't it be
nicer if you shared it?

15:42.239 --> 15:43.074
'Night sweetie.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.445
You okay?

15:47.477 --> 15:50.580
Yeah, of course, just thinking.

15:53.084 --> 15:54.319
She's amazing, isn't she?

15:54.885 --> 15:56.254
Yeah, she is amazing.

16:00.658 --> 16:01.826
Well, come to bed, babe.

16:15.574 --> 16:18.245
You owe a lot of money
to some very bad people...

16:23.516 --> 16:25.486
I saw an opportunity,
so I bought your debt.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.425
Now you work for me.

16:31.592 --> 16:34.728
To repay your debt, I
need you and your crew

16:34.762 --> 16:36.364
to take down the house.

16:36.964 --> 16:38.366
Now...

16:39.867 --> 16:41.703
...go get me my money, Jack.

17:28.586 --> 17:29.755
Oh Jesus.

17:33.259 --> 17:34.360
I almost shot you.

17:34.860 --> 17:36.028
I almost shot you!

17:36.262 --> 17:37.663
Did you pick the lock?

17:38.030 --> 17:40.866
No, Claire told me
where the spare was.

17:41.768 --> 17:42.969
Why do you keep movin' it?

17:43.002 --> 17:44.538
Because you keep using it.

17:45.605 --> 17:48.075
Remind me again,
why did you make me

17:48.109 --> 17:50.044
your daughter's godfather?

17:50.610 --> 17:52.246
That was Sarah's idea.

17:52.279 --> 17:52.912
Ah.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.449
Well, come on in.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.618
Shhh!

18:05.461 --> 18:07.497
I got that intel you wanted.

18:07.530 --> 18:08.864
Thanks, Harry.

18:08.897 --> 18:09.664
It's suicide,

18:09.698 --> 18:11.100
you know that, right?

18:11.134 --> 18:12.634
It's the last one.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.637
Oh, where have I
heard that one before?

18:17.707 --> 18:19.642
Listen, I got no choice.

18:20.144 --> 18:21.378
I haven't gambled in five years,

18:21.411 --> 18:23.380
since I got my team
into this mess.

18:23.413 --> 18:25.215
Gambling was never your problem.

18:25.715 --> 18:27.284
You know, in the beginning you
were betting on your skill,

18:27.317 --> 18:28.452
not your luck.

18:28.485 --> 18:31.156
You were the best,
one of the best,

18:31.889 --> 18:33.424
at any poker table anywhere.

18:35.226 --> 18:36.327
Then you got greedy.

18:37.828 --> 18:41.833
But when you lost,
when you lost big,

18:42.667 --> 18:44.270
best thing that ever
happened to you.

18:44.669 --> 18:45.504
What?

18:46.838 --> 18:48.374
We got you back.

18:48.407 --> 18:52.077
Sarah got her husband back,
I got my best friend back.

18:53.513 --> 18:56.849
But make no mistake, Jack,
you got great instincts.

18:57.517 --> 19:00.253
You need to trust 'em, stop
second-guessing yourself.

19:00.753 --> 19:04.191
Ever since I lost that
hand, don't know if I can.

19:04.624 --> 19:05.859
It's ironic, isn't it.

19:06.527 --> 19:08.762
Gambling is what got you
into this whole mess,

19:09.363 --> 19:11.865
and now, the Money Plane.

19:12.766 --> 19:14.135
Casino in the sky.

19:15.802 --> 19:18.240
Full of the world's most
dangerous criminals.

19:18.273 --> 19:19.874
You sure know how
to pick 'em, pal

19:21.376 --> 19:22.043
But hey,

19:23.545 --> 19:25.813
if anybody's gonna pull
it off, it's gonna be you...

19:26.215 --> 19:27.149
you and your crew.

19:28.116 --> 19:29.652
Heck, might even be a good time.

19:29.885 --> 19:31.221
I doubt that.

19:31.954 --> 19:35.124
But maybe I can convince
you to come with us anyway?

19:35.158 --> 19:36.892
Nope.

19:37.327 --> 19:38.561
Not this time, buddy.

19:39.329 --> 19:41.898
I got this thing about planes.

19:42.233 --> 19:44.702
Coming from
the youngest major general

19:44.734 --> 19:46.437
in the United States Air Force.

19:46.470 --> 19:47.937
Hell, I would've made Lieutenant

19:47.971 --> 19:49.973
if I didn't quit to run
around the world with you.

19:51.141 --> 19:53.411
Agh... Feels like a...

19:54.679 --> 19:55.680
another life!

19:57.182 --> 20:00.719
But someday, I'd love to get
back in the cockpit again,

20:00.751 --> 20:03.221
and fly around the
world, kick ass...

20:03.255 --> 20:04.589
Well, here's your chance!

20:06.925 --> 20:07.759
Another life.

20:10.929 --> 20:12.931
Listen, uh... may I ask
you a favor?

20:13.199 --> 20:14.032
Sure.

20:15.534 --> 20:17.571
Be my backup guy on the ground?

20:17.604 --> 20:18.739
Stay here at the house.

20:18.804 --> 20:21.941
Look after the girls...
I'd owe you one.

20:25.612 --> 20:26.446
Okay.

20:27.614 --> 20:29.284
Anything for my
goddaughter, right?

20:31.185 --> 20:33.721
And I'm gonna look into
this museum job too.

20:34.055 --> 20:36.957
Something seems off
about that, but hey,

20:38.059 --> 20:41.963
anything goes wrong up
there, I'm a phone call away.

20:42.864 --> 20:44.366
Thanks pal.

20:52.641 --> 20:54.210
Hello, and welcome!

20:57.080 --> 20:58.615
- Crew.
- Wonderful,

20:58.648 --> 21:00.816
you'll still need to place
your weapons in the bin.

21:08.659 --> 21:11.162
Oh! All weapons please.

21:17.569 --> 21:18.403
Whoops.

21:25.110 --> 21:25.677
Hi.

21:26.645 --> 21:28.413
Mister Monroe. And
this is my associate,

21:28.447 --> 21:29.682
Mr. McGillicuddy.

21:34.087 --> 21:35.755
Wonderful, thank you.

21:36.789 --> 21:38.191
Weapons in the box, please.

21:41.762 --> 21:43.530
I.. I don't carry any guns.

21:44.631 --> 21:45.466
Huh!

21:47.434 --> 21:48.202
Thank you.

21:48.868 --> 21:49.703
Next!

21:50.804 --> 21:51.772
Ladies and
gentlemen, before you board,

21:51.805 --> 21:53.541
you must deposit your funds,

21:54.709 --> 21:56.177
and remember to keep your
digital wallet wristband on

21:56.211 --> 21:58.747
at all times, it'll allow
you to access your account,

21:58.780 --> 21:59.880
and wager freely.

22:15.398 --> 22:16.399
Welcome aboard.

22:25.409 --> 22:27.744
- This is going to be good!
- Nice.

22:28.078 --> 22:29.380
Really nice.

23:05.119 --> 23:06.687
Ladies
and gentlemen,

23:06.720 --> 23:08.155
as a representative
of the house,

23:08.189 --> 23:11.024
it is my pleasure to welcome
you to the Money Plane.

23:12.193 --> 23:14.495
I am your concierge, and
I'm here to facilitate

23:14.528 --> 23:18.600
your every desire for
action and speculation.

23:18.633 --> 23:20.702
As you know there are
no cameras onboard,

23:20.735 --> 23:23.538
this is to ensure the
utmost discretion.

23:23.572 --> 23:26.274
Rest assured, both
you and your funds

23:26.308 --> 23:27.542
are thoroughly secure.

23:28.643 --> 23:31.447
Myself and my staff
are here onboard

23:31.481 --> 23:34.817
to bring you anything and
everything that you desire.

23:35.818 --> 23:36.953
At this point in time,

23:36.985 --> 23:38.788
I wanna introduce
you to my bookkeeper.

23:38.821 --> 23:41.225
Who will go over the
rules of the house.

23:41.258 --> 23:42.092
Thank you.

23:42.926 --> 23:44.060
Good afternoon.

23:44.094 --> 23:46.129
As a representative
of the house,

23:46.163 --> 23:48.532
it is my job to inform you

23:48.565 --> 23:53.571
of our zero-tolerance
cheating policy.

23:53.605 --> 23:55.640
I cannot express to you enough

23:55.673 --> 23:58.176
how important it is for
your personal wellbeing.

23:59.444 --> 24:02.146
There'll be no loud,
aggressive behavior,

24:02.180 --> 24:06.819
which might disturb another
guest, or crew member.

24:06.852 --> 24:11.857
There'll be no fighting, no
murder, no dismemberment,

24:13.057 --> 24:14.326
unless of course, those
things are permitted

24:14.360 --> 24:17.764
within the rules of engagement
for a specific event.

24:17.797 --> 24:22.602
Keeping that in mind,
good luck, and have fun.

24:24.137 --> 24:27.440
Now without further
ado, sit back, relax,

24:27.474 --> 24:29.277
and prepare for takeoff.

24:43.225 --> 24:46.695
Now, that is a smooth takeoff.

24:46.728 --> 24:49.998
Obliged, we employ the
finest pilots in the world.

24:51.233 --> 24:53.403
I know, because I
myself am a pilot.

24:56.906 --> 24:58.741
It's a long flight,

25:00.176 --> 25:02.412
can I give you a nice tip
so we could be friends?

25:05.583 --> 25:07.618
The airplane consists
of the lounge.

25:07.651 --> 25:10.654
That's where you will
find dining and libations.

25:11.755 --> 25:13.057
It also serves as
our sportsbook,

25:13.090 --> 25:15.492
where you will be
gambling and placing bets

25:15.526 --> 25:18.563
on a series of live
themed adventures.

25:18.597 --> 25:20.899
Next, we have the
main casino floor,

25:20.932 --> 25:23.268
where you'll find
traditional casino fare.

25:24.436 --> 25:26.237
At any point in time,
myself or my staff

25:26.271 --> 25:28.908
can provide you with
a private guest suite

25:28.941 --> 25:31.577
for a power nap, a steam shower,

25:31.611 --> 25:34.981
or if you need to take care
of any personal business.

25:35.014 --> 25:38.384
Please respect the rules
of the house at all times.

25:41.788 --> 25:43.256
May I help you, sir?

25:43.290 --> 25:45.425
Yeah, what's the deal with
the rates for the babes?

25:45.459 --> 25:47.461
What are the prices on this?

25:48.962 --> 25:51.264
The attendants are valued
employees of the house.

25:51.298 --> 25:53.034
They are not for sale.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.771
However we do offer a
wonderful variety of companions

25:56.804 --> 25:58.640
that we can provide
you at any time.

26:06.382 --> 26:07.783
Hi

26:07.816 --> 26:08.651
Yeah!

26:10.319 --> 26:11.954
Reid,

26:11.987 --> 26:14.289
this is amazing.

26:14.323 --> 26:15.157
Holy shit.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.800
A game is about to start.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.636
The American Classic,
Texas Hold 'em,

26:26.670 --> 26:28.839
is about to begin in
the main casino floor.

26:37.348 --> 26:39.216
I've got to find
that server room.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.253
I have to take control
of the cockpit.

26:41.286 --> 26:43.122
It's gonna be a long
flight, let's go.

27:13.121 --> 27:15.190
All right, I'll need to
scan your wristbands,

27:15.222 --> 27:17.225
so you could buy in
to the game, please.

27:19.561 --> 27:22.263
Thank you.

27:22.297 --> 27:23.465
Great.

27:24.632 --> 27:25.500
Thank you.

27:26.735 --> 27:30.140
Perfect, please respect
the dealer at all times,

27:30.173 --> 27:33.609
and as always,
respect the house.

27:33.642 --> 27:35.244
Good luck and have fun.

27:36.479 --> 27:39.482
Welcome to high
stakes Texas hold 'em.

27:47.591 --> 27:49.726
It's your first time?

27:49.760 --> 27:50.594
It is.

27:51.762 --> 27:53.397
Me too, I'm Phillip Monroe.

27:53.431 --> 27:54.432
I know who you are.

27:55.833 --> 27:57.802
Kingpin of the largest
human trafficking ring

27:57.835 --> 27:59.737
on three continents.

27:59.771 --> 28:01.405
Now, human trafficking

28:01.439 --> 28:03.908
is the third largest
criminal enterprise,

28:03.941 --> 28:08.413
right behind drugs, and
my personal favorite,

28:08.447 --> 28:09.281
arms dealing.

28:10.349 --> 28:11.184
Touche.

28:13.452 --> 28:14.620
We met once.

28:17.056 --> 28:17.891
Digitally.

28:19.058 --> 28:22.428
Mr. Vertelli, we
know who you are.

28:22.462 --> 28:23.930
You're the infamous arms dealer

28:23.963 --> 28:25.665
who supplied Iran with materials

28:25.698 --> 28:26.966
to become nuclear capable.

28:28.468 --> 28:31.206
You've got me figured
out, Kemosabe.

28:31.239 --> 28:33.941
But you were already on
the FBI's most wanted list

28:33.974 --> 28:36.278
for selling chemical
weapons in Syria.

28:36.310 --> 28:38.412
Thousands of women
and children suffered.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.849
And here's the kicker,

28:40.882 --> 28:42.951
the Syrian government tried me,

28:42.984 --> 28:44.953
and I was acquitted
by the United Nations,

28:44.986 --> 28:46.922
which makes me an innocent man.

28:48.323 --> 28:50.792
Put a lot of bodies in the
ground in your way to the top.

28:50.826 --> 28:53.696
Look, my granddaddy sold
guns, my daddy sold guns,

28:53.729 --> 28:56.300
I sold my first weapon
before I lost my virginity.

28:56.332 --> 28:57.967
Now, I'm sellin'
nuclear weapons.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.604
Living the American dream,
now who the fuck is this guy?

29:03.273 --> 29:06.577
- I'm Mr. McGillicuddy.
- Well Mr. McGillicuddy,

29:06.610 --> 29:08.745
I'm willing to assume
if some of the women

29:08.779 --> 29:10.647
and children, that you harvest,

29:10.681 --> 29:13.417
were armed by me, there'd
be quite a few less people

29:13.450 --> 29:15.552
trapped in forced labor,
wouldn't there be?

29:15.586 --> 29:18.857
Gentlemen, anything to drink?

29:20.959 --> 29:21.793
Gin.

29:23.027 --> 29:23.828
I'm good.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.172
Is this gonna be a
thing between you two?

29:32.205 --> 29:33.206
You seem to like it.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.218
Is it really necessary?

29:45.652 --> 29:49.357
More than 50% of of your
victims are sexually exploited,

29:49.389 --> 29:51.858
and you've got a
problem with my guy

29:51.892 --> 29:53.027
hitting on a waitress?

29:53.060 --> 29:54.462
Come on.

29:54.495 --> 29:56.298
I just wanna play some
poker, that's all.

29:56.331 --> 29:58.866
Drinks gentlemen?

29:58.900 --> 30:02.637
Round one to Reid.

30:04.139 --> 30:07.310
Mr. Vertelli, keep
your dog on a leash.

30:08.410 --> 30:11.381
You will not be warned again.

30:11.413 --> 30:14.049
All right, everybody calm down.

30:14.082 --> 30:15.285
Let's play some cards.

30:15.318 --> 30:17.754
Reid, you need to relax
a little bit.

30:19.689 --> 30:21.858
Howdy folks, deal me in.

30:24.261 --> 30:26.196
Splendid. Now we have a game.

31:31.434 --> 31:32.001
Quite the game, ladies and
gentlemen, quite the game.

31:52.022 --> 31:53.991
The table shows the
four of diamonds,

31:54.025 --> 31:56.594
the five of hearts,
the seven of clubs,

31:56.627 --> 32:01.199
and the queen of spades.

32:07.373 --> 32:08.207
All in.

32:10.309 --> 32:15.114
Dammit, thanks for
making me feel alive.

32:15.148 --> 32:15.981
I call.

32:18.551 --> 32:21.422
Mr.
JR Crockett calls.

32:21.455 --> 32:22.289
I call.

32:24.124 --> 32:25.858
Fortune favors the bold.

32:25.892 --> 32:27.060
Here comes the river.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.000
A pair of sevens.

32:34.068 --> 32:34.902
Yee-haw!

32:36.237 --> 32:37.372
Full House!

32:37.405 --> 32:39.407
Mr. Monroe please
show your hand.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.915
And a pair of fours.

32:49.017 --> 32:51.753
Gentlemen,
our winner is JR Crockett.

32:53.356 --> 32:55.225
I'd like to retire
to a room please,

32:55.258 --> 32:58.562
I'm feeling off, transfer
my funds to my associate,

32:58.594 --> 33:01.231
Mr. McGillicuddy, I'd
like him to keep playing

33:01.264 --> 33:03.567
- for me please.
- Of course, sir.

33:03.599 --> 33:04.734
Proceed to the lounge,

33:04.768 --> 33:05.902
I'll makes you're
somebody checks you in.

33:05.936 --> 33:07.405
Thank you.

33:07.438 --> 33:09.474
Mr. Monroe is transferring
his funds to Mr. McGillicuddy,

33:09.507 --> 33:11.409
please make sure that
he can wager freely.

33:11.442 --> 33:12.742
Thank you.

33:12.776 --> 33:15.112
All right, good luck young man.

33:19.016 --> 33:22.687
Your winning allows you
to choose the next event.

33:22.720 --> 33:25.524
Well you know I'm a Texan,

33:25.557 --> 33:27.792
but I can still enjoy
a glass of vodka.

33:29.628 --> 33:31.797
Comrades, who wants some?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.821
Hey honey.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.393
You're not supposed
to be down here.

34:28.426 --> 34:30.527
Rules were meant to be fucked.

34:33.030 --> 34:34.465
You wanna get fucked?

34:48.813 --> 34:51.350
Now, you're gonna have to leave,

34:51.382 --> 34:54.353
or else, I'm gonna be
forced to call security.

34:54.387 --> 34:55.721
You tell on me?

34:59.226 --> 35:00.859
What's in the bag?

35:00.893 --> 35:01.961
Employees only.

35:03.163 --> 35:05.233
- Leave!
- What are you up to?

35:06.733 --> 35:09.069
Wouldn't you like to know?

35:22.150 --> 35:24.419
You got balls of steel, amigo.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.429
What's with the red table cloth?

35:34.330 --> 35:35.431
Easier to clean up.

35:38.167 --> 35:41.538
The game, is
roulette of the Russian variety.

35:45.676 --> 35:49.413
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a game of Russian roulette,

35:49.446 --> 35:54.452
featuring undefeated
champion, Mr. JR Crockett.

35:55.052 --> 35:56.053
Bets are open.

35:57.289 --> 36:00.759
You know, at first
I thought to myself,

36:00.791 --> 36:01.726
that's a brave man,

36:03.127 --> 36:05.665
then I realized, Mister...?

36:05.698 --> 36:06.965
McGillicuddy.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.201
McGillicuddy?

36:12.037 --> 36:12.971
A fine Irishman.

36:14.140 --> 36:15.974
And I realized,
Mr. McGillicuddy,

36:17.477 --> 36:19.078
that's not a brave man,

36:19.979 --> 36:21.315
he has a secret.

36:25.419 --> 36:27.154
That is a man,

36:28.323 --> 36:29.856
who's ready to die.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.826
Ready to meet his maker,

36:33.728 --> 36:35.730
ready for what comes next,

36:35.763 --> 36:37.898
because you have
placed yourself tonight

36:37.931 --> 36:41.403
at this table across
from JR Crockett himself,

36:41.437 --> 36:43.838
and that I, JR
Crockett, never lose.

36:46.675 --> 36:48.976
I can't lose, I can't be beat.

36:49.010 --> 36:52.315
No shit, or he wouldn't
be here boring us to death

36:52.349 --> 36:54.384
with this speech.

36:54.417 --> 36:56.553
Your blindfold, sir.

36:56.586 --> 36:59.656
You will be playing first.

36:59.689 --> 37:02.726
20 to one odds, any
takers on 20 to one odds?

37:02.759 --> 37:06.096
20 to one odds, ladies and
gentlemen, 20 to one odds.

37:06.129 --> 37:09.065
Give me a cool
million at 20 to one

37:09.099 --> 37:12.001
- on the Irishman.
- As you wish.

37:12.035 --> 37:13.637
Oh hell, where are my manners?

37:17.609 --> 37:19.177
Sir, as the returning champion,

37:19.211 --> 37:21.680
you have earned the
right to play second,

37:21.713 --> 37:23.215
without even a flip of the coin.

37:24.383 --> 37:26.318
Oh, so you got to go first.

37:27.386 --> 37:29.355
Nah, I'm good, you go!

37:29.389 --> 37:33.659
Sir, as the challenger, you
are obliged to go first.

37:35.228 --> 37:36.696
Rules are rules.

37:36.729 --> 37:39.866
But the man wants to go
first, let the man go first.

37:39.898 --> 37:42.935
The man is just
offering a kind gesture,

37:42.969 --> 37:45.071
the rules of the game are clear.

37:46.340 --> 37:48.809
- I wanna to see the book!
- I am the book.

37:48.842 --> 37:51.043
Oh goddammit, give
me the fucking gun.

37:51.077 --> 37:52.380
I can't lose.

38:06.829 --> 38:08.997
It's about time, what
took you so long?

38:09.030 --> 38:10.766
My fucking feet are killing me.

38:12.868 --> 38:14.437
I hate these shoes.

38:38.629 --> 38:43.569
Babe.

38:52.245 --> 38:53.880
Fucking copilot.

38:56.149 --> 38:57.283
Oh god.

39:06.727 --> 39:09.497
Shit.

39:21.075 --> 39:22.911
- McGillicuddy.
- Thank you.

39:36.959 --> 39:38.427
Don't worry ladies
and gentlemen,

39:38.461 --> 39:41.665
let me remind you our pilots
are the best in the world.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.778
Rest assured, there's
nothing to worry about.

40:56.846 --> 40:57.780
Come here.

41:50.504 --> 41:52.040
Bravo, can you hear me?

41:52.073 --> 41:53.841
- Loud and clear.
- Good.

41:54.942 --> 41:58.212
- Delta come in?
- Copy.

41:58.246 --> 41:59.981
On plane comms connected.

42:00.014 --> 42:01.883
We have control of the cockpit.

42:01.916 --> 42:03.317
Sit rep.

42:03.351 --> 42:05.254
I'm just in the lounge, putting
something in my stomach.

42:05.287 --> 42:07.256
Hey, you guys feel
that turbulence?

42:07.289 --> 42:08.357
Wait, you're eating?

42:09.692 --> 42:11.360
The cargo hold is strange.

42:12.261 --> 42:14.096
What's strange about it?

42:14.129 --> 42:17.534
Well, it was glowing,
and the door was cold.

42:18.702 --> 42:19.602
Server room.

42:21.037 --> 42:23.273
Get down there as soon as
you can, and check it out,

42:23.306 --> 42:24.441
On it.

42:24.474 --> 42:25.742
I'm gonna establish
communications

42:25.775 --> 42:27.110
with Charlie on the ground.

43:04.918 --> 43:06.553
Charlie's Pizza?

43:06.587 --> 43:08.789
Charlie, we have
control of the cockpit,

43:08.822 --> 43:10.225
I'll be re-directing
the plane shortly

43:10.257 --> 43:13.060
to calibrate locations. Sit Rep?

43:13.093 --> 43:15.062
I'm in position,
everything's unloaded.

43:15.095 --> 43:17.132
Got a few things to set up,

43:17.165 --> 43:19.235
we should be up and
running shortly.

43:19.267 --> 43:20.101
Nicely done.

43:22.036 --> 43:24.240
I mean, I've still got some
more time though, right?

43:24.272 --> 43:26.074
Set up the damn gear up now.

43:26.107 --> 43:28.677
Copy, it will be done
by next communication.

43:28.711 --> 43:30.613
- Over and out.
- Over and out.

43:41.725 --> 43:43.760
Mr. Luck-of-the-Irish himself!

43:43.794 --> 43:44.694
That was quite a game.

43:44.728 --> 43:46.930
And you're in luck once again,

43:46.963 --> 43:49.766
the next event is
about to begin.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.202
Follow me to the sportsbook.

44:00.478 --> 44:01.379
Right this way, sir.

44:02.980 --> 44:05.218
Yeah, gotta scratch that itch.

44:06.318 --> 44:07.953
- Let me ask you something.
- Sure.

44:07.986 --> 44:10.122
Can I just bet, and not
participate in the next game?

44:10.155 --> 44:11.890
You know pace myself.

44:11.924 --> 44:13.725
- Chill out a bit.
- Quite right Sir.

44:22.435 --> 44:26.072
May I remind everyone of our
zero-tolerance cheating policy.

44:30.911 --> 44:32.980
Oh my, it's almost time for
the first Themed Adventure

44:33.013 --> 44:36.083
- on the flight.
- Sounds riveting.

44:36.116 --> 44:37.585
The house never disappoints.

44:37.618 --> 44:39.821
Our Themed Adventure wagers
are some of the highlights

44:39.855 --> 44:41.056
of the flight.

44:41.089 --> 44:43.192
According to most of
our recent surveys.

44:44.359 --> 44:46.828
So find a seat, sit
back, and relax,

44:46.862 --> 44:49.298
our Themed Adventures
are about to begin.

44:57.607 --> 45:00.576
Final bets, the event
is about to start.

45:00.610 --> 45:03.814
Mr. McGillicuddy, what
would you like to wager?

45:06.717 --> 45:08.219
I'll take the blue corner.

45:09.786 --> 45:12.357
You're
a witty young man.

45:12.389 --> 45:13.824
It's a timed event.

45:14.892 --> 45:16.561
17?

45:17.729 --> 45:20.865
17 minutes, very aggressive,

45:20.899 --> 45:23.269
but we wouldn't expect
anything less from you.

45:23.302 --> 45:26.238
17 minutes, fine.

45:27.171 --> 45:29.608
Betting is closed on this event.

45:36.582 --> 45:37.917
Man versus Cobra.

45:59.874 --> 46:02.043
- Hello.
- Checking in on my money!

46:03.612 --> 46:05.248
I'd like to keep this
line open for my team.

46:05.281 --> 46:06.682
Yeah, that's right.

46:06.715 --> 46:09.084
Papa bear taking
care of the kids.

46:09.117 --> 46:12.587
Can't hunt and gather on their
own, textbook codependency.

46:12.621 --> 46:14.790
Speaking of codependency,
what do you want?

46:15.792 --> 46:17.493
I want my damn money, Jack.

46:17.527 --> 46:19.929
Don't do that, don't
use my real name.

46:19.963 --> 46:22.366
Oh right, you're on a mission!

46:22.399 --> 46:24.467
So we'll need some
cool code names, right?

46:26.135 --> 46:27.771
What did you call
your superior officer?

46:27.805 --> 46:29.606
My superior officer?

46:29.640 --> 46:31.475
I was a Captain so
he was my colonel.

46:32.810 --> 46:36.448
Cool, I'll call you Captain,
you call me Colonel.

46:36.480 --> 46:39.718
So Cap, I want an update!

46:39.751 --> 46:41.553
We're maintaining deep cover.

46:41.586 --> 46:43.389
We have control of the cockpit.

46:43.422 --> 46:45.123
Once we locate the
vault and the server,

46:45.156 --> 46:46.691
I'll call you back with updates.

46:46.725 --> 46:50.463
And set up my camera,
Jack, I want my live feed.

47:02.242 --> 47:03.744
Ah.

47:03.777 --> 47:07.647
Good boy, I'm keeping an
eye on you and your crew.

47:07.681 --> 47:08.982
Don't think I'm not.

47:09.016 --> 47:10.984
I'm always watching,
remember that, Jack.

47:11.018 --> 47:14.489
Oops, Cap!

47:14.521 --> 47:16.591
Cheer up, you look pissed.

47:25.033 --> 47:29.171
Oh, hell no.

47:34.109 --> 47:38.515
16 minutes, Mr. McGillicuddy
has won the event

47:38.547 --> 47:42.453
with an estimated
17-minute time of death.

47:43.720 --> 47:44.788
Mr. McGillicuddy
wins another one.

48:01.506 --> 48:03.241
- Nothing yet.
- Keep looking.

48:08.747 --> 48:09.614
25,000.

48:12.651 --> 48:13.486
50,000.

48:15.354 --> 48:16.189
100,000.

48:17.857 --> 48:19.892
150,000.

48:19.926 --> 48:21.261
200,000.

48:25.932 --> 48:27.469
13 million Rubles.

48:27.502 --> 48:29.337
200,000 US.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.828
And the winner, a-ha,

48:52.862 --> 48:57.867
the winners are Ms. Yamada
and Mr. McGillicuddy.

48:58.968 --> 49:00.936
- You are on a roll my friend.
- Good.

49:06.377 --> 49:09.813
When I was young, I
chopped off arms for free!

49:13.984 --> 49:15.753
Excuse me, I have to
go to the restroom.

49:31.170 --> 49:33.005
What the hell is
going on out there?

49:35.741 --> 49:38.143
Oh man, yeah, my bad.

49:38.177 --> 49:40.314
I'm sick from watching
all these disgusting bets.

49:40.347 --> 49:41.814
Pull it together, man.

49:41.848 --> 49:44.418
Get your ass back out there
before anyone gets suspicious.

49:44.451 --> 49:46.152
After the game, you find
that damn server room,

49:46.186 --> 49:47.754
and you hack that damn server!

49:48.955 --> 49:49.789
Copy that!

49:51.124 --> 49:53.194
Pull it together,
Trey, pull it together.

50:02.803 --> 50:04.906
Charlie's Pizza, come in.

50:04.940 --> 50:07.142
Okay, this gear is kind
of a nightmare, stand by.

50:10.145 --> 50:10.979
Come on.

50:12.881 --> 50:14.049
Come on please.

50:17.954 --> 50:18.788
Come on.

50:20.990 --> 50:22.626
Green light, the gear is set up,

50:22.659 --> 50:23.859
and up and running,
we are a green light,

50:23.893 --> 50:25.194
mission is a go.

50:25.229 --> 50:26.162
Glad to hear it.

50:34.239 --> 50:36.474
The third event
is about to begin.

50:39.911 --> 50:41.313
Bets are closed.

50:42.180 --> 50:43.649
In five,

50:43.682 --> 50:44.483
four,

50:45.684 --> 50:46.884
three,

50:46.918 --> 50:47.752
two.

51:06.207 --> 51:07.040
Shit.

51:11.445 --> 51:16.451
Whoa, stripped to the bone in
one minute, and 56 seconds.

51:17.286 --> 51:19.755
Won again by Mr. McGillicuddy,

51:19.787 --> 51:22.957
you are on a roll, my
friend, god.

51:25.294 --> 51:28.298
He's got to be cheating,
he's winning everything.

51:55.560 --> 51:56.494
This job sucks.

52:04.002 --> 52:04.836
Hey.

52:07.072 --> 52:08.907
- Hey.
- What are you doing in here?

52:09.841 --> 52:12.177
I, um, was just.

52:13.279 --> 52:14.580
Wait, don't use the radio!

52:15.682 --> 52:17.651
- Block all communications!
- What?

52:17.684 --> 52:18.518
Do it!

52:34.535 --> 52:37.772
Ooh, that's a good song.

52:39.375 --> 52:41.377
Seems like they're
having fun upstairs.

52:42.877 --> 52:43.779
Wanna do the same?

52:58.395 --> 52:59.396
Screw it.

53:09.973 --> 53:14.077
You bitch.

53:33.433 --> 53:37.236
Fuck, this is not the same
vault from the schematics!

53:37.270 --> 53:40.908
Looks like biometric, some
upgraded version of that shit.

53:40.940 --> 53:43.410
I can still crack it, but
I'm gonna need more time!

53:43.444 --> 53:44.611
There is no more time!

53:54.556 --> 53:55.390
Bravo?

53:59.026 --> 54:00.127
Jackpot boys.

54:01.529 --> 54:04.098
I'm gonna need some
help packing this up.

54:04.132 --> 54:06.302
Delta, can you break
away and help Bravo?

54:07.470 --> 54:09.805
Copy that, just
keeping a low profile.

54:11.807 --> 54:14.944
- Ooh, hey, hi.
- Looking for you.

54:14.976 --> 54:17.280
Nah, no, thank you, I'm good.

54:17.314 --> 54:19.181
- Come on
- What's all the commotion?

54:19.215 --> 54:20.951
- Drink shot, shot.
- Have a shot.

54:20.983 --> 54:23.487
Come on, have a drink.

54:25.489 --> 54:27.391
Nothing, I'm on my way.

54:27.425 --> 54:29.694
Pack up the money,
you cover your tracks,

54:29.727 --> 54:31.929
get the hell out of
there, stay alert.

54:49.848 --> 54:51.918
Line secure, what's up?

54:51.951 --> 54:53.151
So, something seemed off

54:53.185 --> 54:54.754
about that botched
museum job, right?

54:54.787 --> 54:56.322
So I did some digging.

54:56.356 --> 54:59.826
You were supposed to steal a
painting for Darius Grouch.

54:59.859 --> 55:03.096
Now, "The Disturbing Duckling"
is a privately owned piece

55:03.129 --> 55:06.000
of art, the name on
record is some company

55:06.032 --> 55:08.002
called Bon Global.

55:08.034 --> 55:11.839
Now, Bon Global is
owned by Rumble Corp.

55:15.544 --> 55:18.045
Why would he have you steal
a painting he already owns?

55:19.213 --> 55:22.517
There's more, the
painting was transferred

55:22.551 --> 55:25.620
out of the museum the
night before the heist.

55:26.955 --> 55:28.223
Museum was tipped.

55:29.224 --> 55:31.727
That sounds like a setup to me.

55:33.061 --> 55:34.697
Do we know where the
painting really is?

55:34.730 --> 55:39.736
Sure, currently on display at
the Palazzo Braschi in Rome.

55:43.072 --> 55:44.841
I'll call you back.

55:57.187 --> 56:00.325
We can't take it all, it's
too much money in that safe.

56:00.358 --> 56:01.993
Packed what I
could, one bag each.

56:02.026 --> 56:03.829
It's all the weight we
can jump with safely.

56:03.862 --> 56:05.931
- Copy that.
- Server's across the hall.

56:07.098 --> 56:08.834
- All right.
- Bravo, Delta, copy.

56:09.768 --> 56:10.603
We read you.

56:12.605 --> 56:15.241
Listen, we all knew
this wasn't right,

56:15.275 --> 56:16.443
but now I know for sure.

56:17.444 --> 56:18.612
Museum was a set up.

56:19.779 --> 56:21.781
- I knew it.
- What do we do?

56:25.217 --> 56:28.121
We proceed with the
plan, we're in too deep.

56:29.056 --> 56:30.190
We've got to get
out of this mess

56:30.223 --> 56:32.259
without getting
double crossed again.

56:32.293 --> 56:35.296
Just be careful, be
vigilant, stay alert.

56:36.631 --> 56:37.465
Stay alive.

56:39.401 --> 56:41.103
This mission just got
even more fucked up.

56:41.135 --> 56:42.504
I've been gone too long.

56:42.537 --> 56:44.773
I've got to get back,
someone's gonna get suspicious.

56:44.806 --> 56:47.174
Good call, I better
make an appearance too.

56:47.208 --> 56:48.310
Let's make it quick.

56:55.150 --> 56:56.719
All right, you take wine.

57:26.183 --> 57:29.187
Don't you piss, you hear
me? Don't you piss yourself.

57:31.357 --> 57:33.191
Stay right there,
I've got to take this.

57:34.360 --> 57:36.662
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

57:36.696 --> 57:37.963
Code names, please.

57:38.932 --> 57:40.701
Colonel, this is Captain.

57:42.135 --> 57:44.838
Captain, this is Colonel,
I read you loud and clear.

57:44.871 --> 57:45.806
What's up.

57:49.042 --> 57:52.246
I'm informing you we have
found and accessed the vault.

57:52.280 --> 57:54.015
We're still searching
for the server.

57:54.048 --> 57:56.617
Good, good, you keep
checking the boxes, Captain.

58:01.389 --> 58:03.125
That museum job that went wrong.

58:03.158 --> 58:04.793
We're working on
it, why do you ask?

58:04.827 --> 58:07.196
Well, I wanna find the son
of a bitch who set us up.

58:07.228 --> 58:09.932
Yeah, well, we don't
have anything yet,

58:09.965 --> 58:13.702
but if we do, I'll let you know.

58:13.736 --> 58:15.171
Not if, when.

58:16.573 --> 58:19.943
When we find out something,
I'll let you know.

58:19.976 --> 58:23.880
Please do, my crew and
I'll do that job for free.

58:23.913 --> 58:26.984
- Be in touch, over and out.
- Yeah, yeah, over and out.

58:27.918 --> 58:29.386
Jesus,

58:29.420 --> 58:31.589
can't hear myself think,
will you shut this guy up?

58:36.761 --> 58:39.397
What the fuck did you do?

58:39.431 --> 58:41.233
I told you shut him
up, not shoot him.

58:41.266 --> 58:43.235
You fucked up my terracotta.

58:43.268 --> 58:44.836
This stuff is porous,
don't you get that?

58:44.870 --> 58:47.672
For God's sake, son of a bitch.

58:47.706 --> 58:49.875
It's never gonna come
out, it's gonna stain.

59:00.953 --> 59:04.691
- Hello.
- Harry, what's going on?

59:04.725 --> 59:05.559
Jack,

59:06.627 --> 59:07.528
I'm training.

59:10.063 --> 59:11.431
I'm sending you an
encrypted message

59:11.465 --> 59:13.834
with some schematics
for a fail safe.

59:13.867 --> 59:17.172
Got a bad feeling about
this, things are going south.

59:17.205 --> 59:20.341
I need you, remember Brazil?

59:20.375 --> 59:22.310
Oh boy, do I remember Brazil.

59:23.478 --> 59:24.746
What happened to Brazil?

59:25.814 --> 59:27.716
You're on a need-to-know
basis, soldier.

59:31.987 --> 59:32.822
Jack,

59:34.223 --> 59:35.157
trust your gut.

59:37.560 --> 59:39.796
We need to move on to Plan B.

59:39.830 --> 59:40.664
Roger that.

59:45.836 --> 59:48.338
I got to take a break, kid.

59:50.006 --> 59:52.109
Don't eat all my
M&M's, okay.

59:54.245 --> 59:55.079
Let's see.

59:57.748 --> 59:59.917
All right you sons of
bitches, let's do it.

01:00:29.149 --> 01:00:31.185
I knew there was something
wrong with this guy.

01:00:31.218 --> 01:00:32.119
I told you.

01:01:01.751 --> 01:01:02.652
Charlie, we are inbound
with rally point location,

01:01:02.685 --> 01:01:04.488
are you up and running?

01:01:04.521 --> 01:01:07.824
Alpha, green light, sync
on standby, ready to rock.

01:01:08.659 --> 01:01:10.761
Delta, how's it coming?

01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:15.401
Great, we're just about there

01:01:15.433 --> 01:01:16.601
with the sync

01:01:17.669 --> 01:01:19.971
And got it!

01:01:20.004 --> 01:01:21.105
Transfer in progress.

01:01:22.941 --> 01:01:24.642
Transfer and
download in progress.

01:01:24.676 --> 01:01:26.745
Alpha, keep us in target range.

01:01:26.779 --> 01:01:28.447
All right everyone, keep it up!

01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:32.518
44%.

01:01:32.551 --> 01:01:36.356
Transfer's at 44%, I repeat 44%.

01:01:36.389 --> 01:01:39.826
Gentlemen, I'm gonna
have to ask you to return

01:01:39.859 --> 01:01:40.794
to the upper deck.

01:01:43.463 --> 01:01:45.598
You take care of the princess,

01:01:45.632 --> 01:01:47.767
and I'll take care of this guy.

01:01:47.801 --> 01:01:48.735
With pleasure.

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:52.374
You really wanna do this?

01:01:52.407 --> 01:01:54.041
Okay then, bitch.

01:01:55.076 --> 01:01:56.243
Here comes daddy.

01:02:01.482 --> 01:02:03.885
Who stole the cookie
from the cookie jar?

01:02:04.886 --> 01:02:06.356
Who me?

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.091
Yeah., you stole that cookie.

01:02:10.225 --> 01:02:13.228
Listen, it's not
what it looks like.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.140
- I like that.
- Love it.

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.975
- You like?
- Love it.

01:02:54.474 --> 01:02:56.575
Ivan, I can explain.

01:03:11.725 --> 01:03:13.428
Halfway there.

01:03:28.844 --> 01:03:30.846
Alpha, come in,
transfer stopped.

01:03:42.926 --> 01:03:44.495
I can't keep the plane
in range any longer.

01:03:44.528 --> 01:03:46.430
We're gonna have to
make another pass.

01:03:48.532 --> 01:03:49.933
- Delta?
- Alpha?

01:03:51.503 --> 01:03:53.170
What the hell's
going on up there?

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:59.511
I don't wanna be late
before the next card game,

01:04:00.445 --> 01:04:02.414
but I got to kill ya.

01:04:05.451 --> 01:04:06.452
Hi Princess.

01:04:29.877 --> 01:04:32.112
Drop the gun, drop
the gun, drop the gun.

01:04:32.146 --> 01:04:34.214
- Get up, get up!
- Get him up, get him up.

01:04:34.248 --> 01:04:35.749
Get him up, get him up.

01:04:37.418 --> 01:04:39.888
Alpha, abort, I'm sorry.

01:04:41.656 --> 01:04:43.791
Bravo, Delta, do you copy?

01:04:43.825 --> 01:04:45.160
- Sit rep.
- Get up.

01:04:49.331 --> 01:04:51.635
What took you so long?

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.169
I was organizing my closet.

01:04:54.504 --> 01:04:56.573
Alpha, do you copy,
I'm with Delta.

01:04:56.606 --> 01:04:57.507
Everything's fine.

01:05:00.009 --> 01:05:02.412
speak for yourself.

01:05:02.445 --> 01:05:05.015
We're out of range, and
the server's been damaged.

01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:07.652
Charlie's been compromised.

01:05:07.684 --> 01:05:10.153
Darius did it
again, he set us up.

01:05:10.187 --> 01:05:11.021
Solution?

01:05:11.855 --> 01:05:13.023
We do not let him win.

01:05:14.292 --> 01:05:15.826
Listen, can you
reboot the server?

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.162
Download it onto a portable SSD?

01:05:18.196 --> 01:05:20.831
If it's stable enough
to handle the transfer.

01:05:20.865 --> 01:05:23.267
But the moment the
drive boots via USB,

01:05:23.302 --> 01:05:25.671
their security software
will tip them off,

01:05:25.703 --> 01:05:27.340
they'll know there's a breach.

01:05:27.373 --> 01:05:29.676
Do it, we're out of options.

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:32.412
But they'll be able to
trace it back to us.

01:05:32.445 --> 01:05:35.214
Not us, we have a Plan B.

01:05:36.148 --> 01:05:37.483
Plan B.

01:05:45.326 --> 01:05:46.726
Okay, ladies and gents,

01:05:48.228 --> 01:05:49.563
here comes Harry.

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:08.917
Who's next?

01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:00.340
Stay still, you bastard.

01:07:01.574 --> 01:07:04.978
Come on, I'll tear
one right up your ass.

01:07:06.647 --> 01:07:07.615
And.

01:07:13.554 --> 01:07:15.324
sucks to be you, pal.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:22.830
Hey Harry.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:25.900
Hey pal, how're ya doing?

01:07:42.619 --> 01:07:44.987
Hello, who's this?

01:07:45.021 --> 01:07:46.757
What do you mean who's this?

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:47.624
Please hold.

01:08:05.444 --> 01:08:06.679
Who're you holding for again?

01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:09.348
Need I remind you
who you work for?

01:08:09.382 --> 01:08:11.282
I've been up here,
above the clouds,

01:08:11.317 --> 01:08:13.619
I don't know, it's given
me some perspective.

01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:18.057
I've been thinking, what
if I don't work for you?

01:08:19.459 --> 01:08:21.193
What if you were actually
just a little bitch?

01:08:21.227 --> 01:08:23.895
And what if this money wasn't
actually yours anymore?

01:08:25.064 --> 01:08:26.031
Are you really fucking
with me right now?

01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:27.934
Are you fucking with me?

01:08:27.968 --> 01:08:30.371
You think you're bad ass, yeah?

01:08:30.404 --> 01:08:32.874
The criminals on this
plane would eat you alive.

01:08:32.906 --> 01:08:35.542
On this plane, you're a
dime a dozen, Colonel.

01:08:35.576 --> 01:08:37.645
I don't give a fuck
who's on that plane.

01:08:37.678 --> 01:08:40.214
I'm the baddest mother
fucker on the planet!

01:08:40.247 --> 01:08:43.050
I am Darius Grouch
the Third, The Rumble,

01:08:43.084 --> 01:08:45.051
and I am taking down
the Money Plane.

01:08:45.086 --> 01:08:48.590
- Now bring me my money.
- Please hold on.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.770
Time to burn down the village.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:53.225
Fuck.

01:10:57.997 --> 01:10:58.798
goddammit.

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:07.408
Ow.

01:11:17.184 --> 01:11:20.388
Speed and altitude decreased,
auto-pilot engaged.

01:11:20.422 --> 01:11:21.556
Transfer complete,

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:23.290
with the key to access
all the cryptocurrency.

01:11:23.325 --> 01:11:25.460
- Over $1-billion.
- And the clock is ticking.

01:11:25.493 --> 01:11:26.796
It's only a matter of time
before they figure out

01:11:26.829 --> 01:11:28.064
they've been hacked.

01:11:28.096 --> 01:11:29.398
Leave that to me.

01:11:29.432 --> 01:11:32.068
Now that we have the
funds, what's next?

01:11:32.133 --> 01:11:34.070
Let's redistribute the wealth.

01:11:34.102 --> 01:11:36.739
We can donate it to anonymous
charities worldwide.

01:11:36.772 --> 01:11:39.175
Untraceable, non-reversible.

01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:40.844
We'd be giving the money
back to those who suffered

01:11:40.877 --> 01:11:42.479
at the hands of these bastards.

01:11:42.512 --> 01:11:45.916
UNICEF, Polaris, uh,
refugees of Syria,

01:11:45.949 --> 01:11:47.584
you name it.

01:11:47.618 --> 01:11:49.086
A little
steal from the rich?

01:11:49.118 --> 01:11:51.589
- And give to the poor.
- Exactly.

01:11:51.623 --> 01:11:54.525
You sure about this, what
about your debt to Darius?

01:11:54.559 --> 01:11:56.728
I told you, I have
a Plan B, do it.

01:12:00.531 --> 01:12:03.702
A whole lot of people just
got a whole lot of money.

01:12:05.236 --> 01:12:06.237
What about the cash?

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.042
I don't want it,
split the money.

01:12:10.075 --> 01:12:10.909
The same here.

01:12:15.048 --> 01:12:16.016
Me neither.

01:12:16.049 --> 01:12:18.183
Let's spread the
wealth manually.

01:12:18.217 --> 01:12:19.151
Got a call to make.

01:12:31.999 --> 01:12:32.833
Hey.

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.466
I hope you have
come to your senses!

01:13:03.534 --> 01:13:05.836
Any good job has
three critical parts.

01:13:05.869 --> 01:13:07.504
First, you need a great team.

01:13:07.538 --> 01:13:10.074
It takes more than one
flint to start a fire.

01:13:10.107 --> 01:13:12.576
Second, you need a
proper diversion.

01:13:12.609 --> 01:13:15.747
There's the way things are and
the way things appear to be

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.050
and the SSD that has the access
key to the cryptocurrency,

01:13:19.951 --> 01:13:21.186
we thought it'd be better served

01:13:21.218 --> 01:13:23.121
if we dispersed that
digitally to charities

01:13:23.154 --> 01:13:25.457
around the world that are
dealing with horrible issues,

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:29.260
like, I don't know,
human trafficking.

01:13:29.294 --> 01:13:32.263
You're dead, your
families are all dead,

01:13:32.297 --> 01:13:35.367
you, your crew, and
everyone you ever met.

01:13:35.401 --> 01:13:37.870
Dead by the time you touch down.

01:13:37.903 --> 01:13:41.742
Lastly, if there's no
Darius, there's no debt.

01:13:43.076 --> 01:13:48.081
Always have a Plan B.

01:13:49.516 --> 01:13:51.284
I don't give a
fuck who's on that plane,

01:13:51.318 --> 01:13:53.621
I'm the baddest
motherfucker on the planet.

01:13:53.654 --> 01:13:56.624
I am Darius Grouch
the third, The Rumble,

01:13:56.657 --> 01:13:58.059
and I am taking down
the Money Plane.

01:13:58.092 --> 01:13:59.761
Now bring me my money.

01:14:03.766 --> 01:14:04.967
On behalf of the house,
I wanna assure you

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.902
that Mr. Grouch's head
will be on a platter

01:14:06.935 --> 01:14:08.403
by the time we land.

01:14:08.437 --> 01:14:11.240
The House will compensate
any lost funds.

01:14:11.272 --> 01:14:13.408
Let's have a new wager.

01:14:13.442 --> 01:14:15.178
Who wants to wager
how long it'll take

01:14:15.211 --> 01:14:18.348
'til we get notice of
Mr. Grouch's death?

01:14:22.018 --> 01:14:27.024
15 minutes at 50,000.

01:14:28.058 --> 01:14:32.029
Very nice.

01:14:36.567 --> 01:14:37.935
We just did that.

01:14:37.969 --> 01:14:39.303
First time for everything.

01:14:40.138 --> 01:14:41.940
We never did get that painting.

01:14:41.973 --> 01:14:45.443
Well, I guess we have
one last, last job to do.

01:14:45.477 --> 01:14:47.345
Payback's a bitch.

01:14:47.379 --> 01:14:48.613
You ready?

01:14:48.647 --> 01:14:53.653
Let's strap in.

01:15:48.378 --> 01:15:50.581
An eye for an eye, Colonel.

01:15:50.615 --> 01:15:51.782
I got to jump.

01:16:22.248 --> 01:16:25.752
When we pull it
off, we are done.

01:16:27.087 --> 01:16:32.092
Yeah, we're square.

01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:37.598
now, go get me my money, Jack.

01:16:45.607 --> 01:16:46.675
I'm out, Darius.

01:16:47.876 --> 01:16:50.746
Hold on, P-Roach.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.614
Hold on.

01:16:54.283 --> 01:16:55.117
Okay.

01:17:38.432 --> 01:17:41.968
Rumble time.

01:18:38.897 --> 01:18:42.033
Hello?

01:18:42.067 --> 01:18:44.769
My source has an offer
on your painting.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:47.305
It seems the publicity
from the heist

01:18:47.338 --> 01:18:50.242
drove the price
up to 60 million.

01:18:54.747 --> 01:18:57.417
Split four ways, not
a bad retirement.

01:18:59.085 --> 01:19:00.252
We'll split five ways.

01:19:01.421 --> 01:19:02.255
See you in Paris.

01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:04.425
All right.

01:19:06.927 --> 01:19:10.931
What are you doing?

01:19:21.109 --> 01:19:26.115
I know, you're so silly.

01:19:28.117 --> 01:19:31.887
What are you doing?

01:19:33.122 --> 01:19:37.427
It's your turn now.

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:45.930
