00:00.041 --> 00:01.291
<i>Previously on</i> Kickin' It...

00:01.333 --> 00:02.875
Hey, Rudy. How was lunch with your uncle?

00:02.959 --> 00:04.709
He offered me a job.

00:04.792 --> 00:06.917
You should know I've sold the dojo.

00:08.667 --> 00:09.625
What?

00:09.709 --> 00:13.041
The contract I signed with Bobby Wasabi
said I couldn't kick them out,

00:13.125 --> 00:15.417
but it didn't say anything
about them quitting.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.834
Five-minute break, then we're gonna
do sit-ups until you puke.

00:21.333 --> 00:23.333
You win. We quit.

00:24.208 --> 00:25.834
The Wasabi Warriors!

01:14.417 --> 01:16.375
I'm gonna miss everything
about that place...

01:17.625 --> 01:19.709
Even the weird rat
that lives under the radiator.

01:19.792 --> 01:22.208
Yeah, I mean... wait, that's a rat?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.792
Rudy told me
that was a hairless Brazilian dog.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.291
I let that thing kiss me.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.750
That dojo was the thing
that kept us together.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.583
We don't need a dojo to keep us together.

01:34.834 --> 01:36.041
Right, Jack?

01:37.458 --> 01:38.792
Of course.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.291
Guys, nothing's gonna change.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.625
Okay, you have a breakfast with marketing,

01:45.709 --> 01:46.875
brunch with the Union Rep,

01:46.959 --> 01:49.250
lunch with accounting,
dinner with advertising,

01:49.375 --> 01:51.333
- and dessert with sales.
<i>Oh!</i>

01:51.417 --> 01:53.875
I'm so sick of eating!

01:55.250 --> 01:57.917
And your two o'clock
from the sideshow is here.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.834
It's with Benny, the world's smallest man.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.125
- Send him in.
<i>Come in, Benny!</i>

02:10.166 --> 02:12.458
We've had some
more complaints about you, Benny.

02:13.291 --> 02:14.417
I'm gonna have to let you go.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.458
Hey. That kind of language is unnecessary.

02:20.542 --> 02:22.208
I will not fight with you.

02:24.291 --> 02:27.625
- Really?
- And how is my favorite nephew?

02:27.709 --> 02:30.375
- Oh, sorry. I didn't realize--
- No, no. Don't worry.

02:30.458 --> 02:31.583
Benny was on his way out.

02:34.917 --> 02:36.667
Wow. Attitude.

02:38.542 --> 02:42.291
Because of you, attendance
at Circus Town is up 50%.

02:42.375 --> 02:46.000
Now I'm opening a new park in Taiwan,
and I want you to run it.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.333
I'm... I'm flattered, Uncle Blake.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.250
But Taiwan's pretty far away.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.625
I'll pay you a million dollars.

02:52.709 --> 02:55.125
- I will pack my bags!
- All right.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.583
I am very proud of you, Rudy.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.166
The whole family is so proud.

03:00.709 --> 03:02.458
Goodbye, Mr. Gillespie.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.041
Bye.

03:09.041 --> 03:10.333
Whoo-whee!

03:10.792 --> 03:12.792
Look who's a fat cat now.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.875
You heard about my promotion.

03:14.959 --> 03:16.250
What promotion?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Jack, it's Rudy.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.750
Hey. No, I know, I know. Way too long.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.959
Hey, you think you could get
the gang together?

03:35.041 --> 03:37.583
Yeah, yeah.
I'm actually with them right now.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.583
All right, I'll see you tomorrow night.

03:41.250 --> 03:44.000
Yo, Jack. What goes great
with falafel ball?

03:44.083 --> 03:45.375
Old man!

03:49.583 --> 03:51.917
Now you're not getting your ball back!

03:53.875 --> 03:56.500
Uh, Jack, there's some bullies outside

03:56.583 --> 03:58.291
and they just pulled the basket
off my bike.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.083
I don't do the whole karate thing anymore.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.583
You gotta fight your own fights, man.

04:04.583 --> 04:07.000
Hey. Leave the old guy alone, Randy.

04:07.083 --> 04:08.291
Where you going?

04:08.375 --> 04:10.709
I gotta track down some friends
I haven't seen in a while.

04:12.041 --> 04:13.834
Same time tomorrow, Mr. Rosenbaum?

04:13.917 --> 04:15.834
Hope you can come back
so we can have a little more--

04:18.166 --> 04:20.417
I was in the war, hair-bag!

04:23.000 --> 04:25.041
I saw you at practice yesterday.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.375
I'll say it, I love watching you sweat.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.750
I didn't see you
at my French horn practice.

04:30.834 --> 04:33.208
I was outside the window on my polo pony.

04:33.834 --> 04:36.834
When you played Tchaikovsky's "Fifth",
I got so excited...

04:36.917 --> 04:38.959
I chewed the end off my riding crop!

04:41.083 --> 04:43.166
Claire, I told you I have a girlfriend.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.792
One day I will have you, Milton.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.875
You and that beautiful
bulbous brain of yours.

04:54.125 --> 04:55.959
Holy Christmas nuts! Jack!

04:56.041 --> 04:58.125
- What's up, buddy?
- I haven't seen you in months.

04:58.208 --> 04:59.875
Uh, not since you transferred
to Swathmore.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.583
It's good to see you.

05:01.667 --> 05:04.291
And that beautiful bulbous brain of yours.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.667
How is everybody?

05:06.750 --> 05:08.125
I don't really know.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.875
I run into Eddie every once in a while.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.375
How are you and Kim doing?

05:11.917 --> 05:13.625
I don't really see her much.

05:13.709 --> 05:15.417
And I completely lost track of Jerry.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.500
He's here.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.083
Oh, right. Jerry got into Swathmore?

05:19.625 --> 05:20.709
Kind of.

05:21.208 --> 05:24.750
<i>♪ Surfing the lightning!
The lightning, the lightning!♪</i>

05:29.500 --> 05:31.166
Whoo!

05:33.750 --> 05:35.291
Yo! Jack!

05:35.375 --> 05:37.834
- What it do, man?
- What are you doing here?

05:37.917 --> 05:40.542
Well, I left Seaford High to go
to night school with my cousin Chewey.

05:40.625 --> 05:42.917
Yeah, that way I can work
this sweet custodian job.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.667
Guys, Rudy wants to know if he could
have dinner with us tomorrow night.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.834
- He says he has some big news.
- What kind of news?

05:48.083 --> 05:51.250
I don't know, but for Rudy's sake,
I think we should get together and,

05:51.291 --> 05:53.500
you know, pretend things
are the way they used to be.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.709
Jack, I'd love to get the old gang
back together and see Rudy.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.375
But I've got a lot of other stuff
going on right now.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.750
Oh, tomorrow's my big French horn recital.

06:03.208 --> 06:04.875
Uh, I can't.

06:04.959 --> 06:06.625
I got a date with a real cutie.

06:06.709 --> 06:08.417
Yeah, I think she likes my new scent.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.750
Check it.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.250
Urinal cakes, yo.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.417
Mmm, pine fresh.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.792
Your mother was right.
You weren't built for karate.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.667
You were built for one thing.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.875
The merengue!

06:23.959 --> 06:25.792
<i>Music! Oh!</i>

06:25.875 --> 06:29.542
I can't believe how much progress
you've made in just two months.

06:29.625 --> 06:31.542
- One, two. One, two.
- Oh, thanks, Mrs. King.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.250
I practice every night with Rosie.

06:33.291 --> 06:35.000
- Your sister?
- No, my Doberman.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.542
- Yesterday I dipped her...
-

06:38.625 --> 06:40.834
- she coughed up a dead bird.
-

06:43.959 --> 06:46.500
- Hey, hey, Jack! What's going on, dude?
- What's up, buddy?

06:46.583 --> 06:49.417
Uh, Rudy needs to know if you can make
a really important dinner tomorrow night.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.375
I got a big dance show.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.500
It's old school.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.500
It's about taking it back to the street.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.709
I get to wear bedazzled tights.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.875
But Eddie, this is really important.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.542
- Rudy really wants us tomorrow.
- Well, well, well.

07:02.625 --> 07:05.583
If it isn't Jack
and his old pal, twinkle toes.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.500
Frank, why don't you get lost?
We're talking.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.667
Well, I do my talking with my fists,

07:10.750 --> 07:12.417
and this one has something to say.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.208
Ow.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.125
I probably shouldn't have done that.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.709
Not so tough anymore, are you, Jack?

07:24.291 --> 07:25.500
I guess I'm a little rusty.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.208
Hey, if you're looking
to get back into shape,

07:27.291 --> 07:28.917
there's an opening at the dance academy.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.083
- In fact...
- I'm not dancing with you, Eddie.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.542
You have to grunt like that?

07:38.583 --> 07:41.792
You sound like my father
when he passed his kidney stone.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.375
Uh... sorry. Old habit.

07:45.458 --> 07:47.208
Just trying to energize our practice.

07:48.125 --> 07:50.875
Ew, it's that skeevy skater dude.

07:50.959 --> 07:52.583
Thinks he's so cute with that hair

07:52.667 --> 07:54.583
and those two moles
that are just so plain...

07:54.667 --> 07:56.917
...naughty.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.959
Uh, girls, take a five.

08:01.083 --> 08:02.333
Hey, Kim. How you been?

08:02.417 --> 08:03.458
I'm fine.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.333
Did you get my message about tonight?

08:05.417 --> 08:07.417
Uh, yeah I can't make it. Sorry.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.291
It's for Rudy. It sounded important.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.917
Well, staying connected was important,
but that didn't happen either.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.709
It wasn't just me.
We all went in different directions.

08:14.792 --> 08:18.166
We lost the dojo, Jack,
but I didn't think we'd lose each other.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.083
Kim, when you're done with practice,
we'll go grab a slice.

08:24.792 --> 08:27.500
Oh, uh, Jack, this is Brett. He's my...

08:28.709 --> 08:29.750
boyfriend.

08:31.667 --> 08:32.667
I'll see you around.

08:34.417 --> 08:36.417
Give me an "awk"! Give me a "ward"!

08:36.500 --> 08:38.750
What do you got? Awkward!

08:45.750 --> 08:47.208
I can't believe you guys came!

08:47.291 --> 08:50.667
Well, after seeing you, we all started
thinking about how we used to be.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.875
Jack, do you think Rudy's big news

08:53.959 --> 08:56.208
is that he wants to quit his job
and get his dojo back?

08:56.291 --> 08:57.583
That's what I was hoping.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.000
- Kim, you made it!
Hey, Kim!

09:00.500 --> 09:01.917
- It's good to see you again.
-

09:02.000 --> 09:03.333
Rudy!

09:06.166 --> 09:07.291
Wow!

09:07.750 --> 09:09.041
You look, uh...

09:09.125 --> 09:11.917
I know. I know.
Everyone's talking about it.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.458
I got my eyebrows waxed!

09:22.375 --> 09:24.000
So, uh, Rudy, what's the big news?

09:24.083 --> 09:26.834
Well, um....

09:29.834 --> 09:32.208
I got a big promotion
and I'm moving to Taiwan.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.583
Wow.

09:37.583 --> 09:38.834
Taiwan, that's...

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
That's great, Rudy.

09:41.458 --> 09:43.291
I just wanted to tell you guys in person.

09:43.750 --> 09:47.250
You know, uh, tonight is about remembering
all of the great times that we shared.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.166
So order anything that you want.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.500
Believe it or not, I could eat a horse.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.667
Or maybe try a salad.

09:56.583 --> 09:59.291
Uh, Rudy, you were so scared,
you ran through the wall.

10:00.417 --> 10:03.500
Okay, for your information,
ladybugs will bite if provoked.

10:06.834 --> 10:08.333
Oh, man. Look at the time.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.166
I gotta go pack.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.667
We should get going too.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.458
Guys, this was great.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.625
And, you know, you might not have me.

10:22.709 --> 10:26.166
But you still got the dojo
and more importantly, each other.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.750
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:27.834 --> 10:29.166
- Yeah.
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:30.083 --> 10:31.542
I'll always love you, guys.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.709
What do you say? One last time?

10:34.792 --> 10:35.750
Wasabi.

10:37.625 --> 10:38.834
Wasabi!

10:39.375 --> 10:41.417
All right, get out of here.
I'm gonna pay this bill.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.542
Ah, one last time. Come on. Get in here.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.083
Ah, love you guys.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.375
- See ya.
- Take care, Rudy.

10:52.458 --> 10:53.792
- Bye!
- See you, later.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.917
<i>You don't walk away
from your friends when they need you.</i>

11:26.000 --> 11:28.625
<i>You're a great sensei and you mean
everything to your students.</i>

11:28.709 --> 11:29.792
<i>You know what?</i>

11:29.875 --> 11:33.458
<i>We're gonna stay right here
and do the best we can, together.</i>

11:35.458 --> 11:37.834
Whoa! Look at you, Rudy!

11:37.917 --> 11:39.500
What happened to your eyebrows?

11:41.291 --> 11:42.333
Ty.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.625
Whatever differences we may have had,

11:45.709 --> 11:47.709
you set 'em aside
and you've done right by my kids.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.583
So thank you.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.750
It's important for me to know
that this dojo will always be their home.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.291
Their home?

11:55.375 --> 11:56.500
They don't come here anymore.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.875
- What?
- Eh.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.542
Those losers left like three months ago.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.750
What were you guys thinking?

12:06.834 --> 12:08.667
You've never lied to me before.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.291
Actually, that's not true.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.583
There was the burnt carpet thing,

12:11.667 --> 12:13.375
the missing toilet thing,
the hole inside--

12:13.458 --> 12:15.166
I get it! You've lied to me before.

12:16.875 --> 12:20.959
Rudy, we didn't want you to miss out
on a great opportunity because of us.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.458
Let me ask you guys something.

12:25.917 --> 12:29.291
If I were the sensei in that dojo,
would you come back?

12:30.542 --> 12:32.083
- Absolutely.
- Of course, we would.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.375
Ty.

12:35.750 --> 12:39.625
- I want my dojo back.
- I'm not selling the dojo, Judy.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.625
I hate this guy, but he makes me laugh.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.291
I'll give you double what you paid for it.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.000
I'm not interested in your money.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.625
Well, there is something other than money.

12:52.709 --> 12:54.125
Uh...

12:54.208 --> 12:55.875
But you'd probably never go for it.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.750
Collectible presidential plates?

12:57.834 --> 13:00.458
'Cause I have everybody but Taft.
Do you have a Taft?

13:00.542 --> 13:02.291
I'm not talking about plates.
I'm talking about...

13:02.375 --> 13:05.041
Wait, do you have a Coolidge?
Because that would complete my set.

13:05.125 --> 13:06.333
Rudy!

13:08.417 --> 13:10.333
I'm talking about a challenge.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.417
My students against your students.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.166
Winner gets the dojo.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.875
Unless you're too, uh...

13:16.959 --> 13:17.834
...scared.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.291
Ooh!

13:20.625 --> 13:21.917
Two conditions.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.375
One, not just our students,
but sensei against sensei.

13:25.458 --> 13:29.542
And two, when you lose, I get your Taft!

13:29.625 --> 13:30.750
Deal.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.250
One week from today.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.166
Guys, we have got to win this!

13:38.250 --> 13:41.041
You're right. The entire future
of our dojo rides on this.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.208
That, and I don't have a Taft.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.333
Guys, if we wanna win this,
we're gonna have to get back into shape.

13:47.417 --> 13:49.375
Jack's right. Look at you.

13:49.875 --> 13:51.208
You people are a mess.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.166
I know someone who can help.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.709
I'll call my Aunt Jillian.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.709
Your Aunty Jillian?

14:00.792 --> 14:03.417
What is she gonna do?
Knit us a scarf while we do sit-ups?

14:04.083 --> 14:06.959
She's pretty good.
I'm not sure you can handle it.

14:07.041 --> 14:09.083
Uh, trust me, Milton.

14:09.166 --> 14:11.750
There's nothing your aunty
can dish out that I can't take.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.208
I can't take it! I can't take it!

14:16.291 --> 14:20.917
Tell me, was your body screaming like this
when you were shoveling donuts into it?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.458
Yes, but I jammed two cupcakes
into my ears so I couldn't hear it.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.166
- What are you two doing?
-

14:29.250 --> 14:30.583
We were just talking about you.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.083
We think you're pretty awesome
coming down here to help them out.

14:33.166 --> 14:36.500
And I love your little workout outfit.
It is so cute.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.291
You know what I think would be cute?

14:38.375 --> 14:41.750
You grabbing the treadmill
and doing ten miles, Goldilocks!

14:48.875 --> 14:50.291
What's going on over here?

14:50.583 --> 14:52.250
Oh, I'm just climbing the stairs.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.792
This machine's pretty easy.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.625
- Yeah? How about now?
-

14:56.000 --> 14:57.959
-
- Hmm? Better?

14:58.792 --> 14:59.667
Uh...

14:59.750 --> 15:03.208
Mommy!

15:07.667 --> 15:09.166
Why are your feet not moving?

15:09.250 --> 15:10.959
Because I'm coasting downhill.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.834
Not anymore. Go, go, go!

15:13.917 --> 15:18.709
Go! People, the only sound
I wanna hear right now

15:18.792 --> 15:21.917
is the sound of your fat burning!

15:26.834 --> 15:29.250
Milty, honey. Don't bulk up too much.

15:31.667 --> 15:32.834
Come on!

15:38.208 --> 15:39.667
Jillian, that was amazing.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.583
You did it. You got us back into shape.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.125
Uh, but there is one last thing
that I'd like to do.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.583
And, believe me, it's from all of us.

15:51.625 --> 15:55.625
Look, guys, I was tough on you
because I care, all right?

15:55.709 --> 15:58.291
You see, the key to a long,
healthy, happy life

15:58.417 --> 16:00.542
is being in great shape.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.375
Now, go get your dojo back!

16:03.500 --> 16:05.500
Go, go, go, go!

16:08.166 --> 16:10.000
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

16:16.625 --> 16:17.709
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

16:17.792 --> 16:19.250
- Yeah!
-

16:19.291 --> 16:21.625
Yes! All right!

16:21.709 --> 16:24.125
Great job, Kim. It's two to two.

16:24.208 --> 16:25.875
Jack, put us ahead.

16:25.959 --> 16:28.083
- Don't worry, Rudy. I got this.
- Whoo!

16:28.166 --> 16:30.291
- Yeah, come on, Jackie!
- Come on, Jack! Come on!

16:50.417 --> 16:52.000
Great. A draw.

16:52.291 --> 16:53.959
You had it, Ryan. We had it.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.375
Sorry, I let you down.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.208
But it didn't lose. It was a tie.

16:57.291 --> 16:59.375
A tie is like kissing your sister!

16:59.458 --> 17:01.834
I kissed your sister
when we were in college.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.208
It's not fun.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.542
Sorry, guys. I lost my focus for a second.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.166
Rudy, this means you have to win.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.333
I'm the one who gave this place up.

17:14.417 --> 17:16.583
- I'm the one who's gonna win it back.
Yeah.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.834
- Come on, Rudy. You got it, man.
- Whoo! Let's go, Rudy!

17:19.917 --> 17:22.041
So it all comes down to you and me, Ty.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.291
For the dojo.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.542
Yeah, about that.
You're not gonna be fighting me.

17:25.625 --> 17:26.834
What are you talking about?

17:26.917 --> 17:28.583
You said it was gonna be
sensei against sensei.

17:28.667 --> 17:29.959
It is.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.000
I forgot to tell you.
I hired a new sensei this morning.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.792
Meet Kofi Kingston.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.375
Guys, a little change of plans.

17:46.458 --> 17:49.417
Instead of winning the dojo back,
looks like I'm gonna die.

17:51.291 --> 17:53.667
Rudy, remember what
you've always taught us.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.625
If you believe in yourself,
there's nothing you can't do.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.166
You know who I got that from?

17:58.250 --> 17:59.834
Frosty the Snowman.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.834
I am going to die!

18:04.125 --> 18:05.834
Put me in, coach.

18:06.125 --> 18:07.917
I'll tear up this guy.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.583
Murray, put your glasses on.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.458
Oy, oy, yoy.

18:15.542 --> 18:18.667
I'll say some nice words at your funeral.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.542
- Let's go, Rudy! Come on!
- You can do it, man!

18:24.625 --> 18:26.583
Any particular way you want
your legs ripped off?

18:27.291 --> 18:28.792
Surprise me.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.250
Wearing him out by letting him
beat you senseless.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.208
That's thinking.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.166
Ref, would you be a dove
and give me a quick time-out?

18:59.250 --> 19:01.792
My colon's making an odd squishy sound.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.166
Oh!
- Rudy!

19:28.250 --> 19:30.875
Step out of the square and stop the fight.
You're gonna get killed.

19:30.959 --> 19:33.291
I can't. We'll lose the dojo.

19:33.417 --> 19:35.417
Rudy, the dojo is just a building.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.208
Don't you get it?
As long as we're together, we've won.

19:38.291 --> 19:41.834
Yeah, Rudy.
- Get in there and fight, girly boy!

19:43.875 --> 19:46.417
You're right. We did win.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.667
And I know it's just a building.

19:50.375 --> 19:51.667
But it's our building.

19:53.041 --> 19:55.250
Come on, Rudy! Let's go, buddy!

20:10.792 --> 20:12.083
- Yeah!
- Rudy did it!

20:12.166 --> 20:13.875
You just couldn't do it, could you?

20:13.959 --> 20:16.417
You're just a big lame loser!

20:24.208 --> 20:25.250
Uncle Blake.

20:25.667 --> 20:26.667
Uh...

20:27.458 --> 20:29.083
I have something I need to tell you.

20:29.166 --> 20:32.500
Ah, don't worry, Rudy.
Ms. Monroe told me everything.

20:32.583 --> 20:35.458
And you know all that money
I gave you a long time ago?

20:35.542 --> 20:38.750
From what I've seen,
I made a really good investment.

20:39.959 --> 20:41.750
You came all the way down here
just to tell me that?

20:41.834 --> 20:44.000
No, no, I came to pick up Ms. Monroe.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.667
Can you believe how cheesy this thing is?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.125
I know, right?

20:53.208 --> 20:56.500
So tacky, so gaudy, so ridiculous.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.208
You want your face painted over his,
don't you?

20:58.291 --> 20:59.709
More than life itself.

21:00.917 --> 21:03.041
<i>♪ And no matter how much
I chop and punch ♪</i>

21:03.125 --> 21:05.917
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you ♪</i>

21:06.000 --> 21:08.375
So anyway, Brett, I hope you understand.

21:08.458 --> 21:09.750
It's just...

21:10.291 --> 21:11.917
I still have feelings for someone else.

21:15.834 --> 21:17.500
Jack! I was just, uh...

21:18.333 --> 21:20.417
You weren't supposed to hear that.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.250
I don't know. I'm kinda glad I did.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.041
Hey, uh, you know what?

21:24.125 --> 21:26.709
Instead of going to practice,
you wanna go get some pizza?

21:27.834 --> 21:30.041
We're gonna blow off practice
just so we can have a...

21:30.583 --> 21:31.500
A date.

21:35.375 --> 21:37.333
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

21:40.875 --> 21:44.291
And then they told me
it involved math, so I quit.

21:46.917 --> 21:49.917
Ah, I love the sound of your voice.

21:51.917 --> 21:53.667
Oh, Blakey.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.333
I have something to tell you.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.709
But Donna, I care about you so much.

21:57.792 --> 22:01.792
Nothing you could say could change
the way I feel about you right now.

22:04.083 --> 22:06.542
My name's Joan and this is my real voice.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.417
I'm out.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.750
Oh, that date lasted 17 minutes.

22:13.834 --> 22:14.834
A new record.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.625
A new record, everybody!
